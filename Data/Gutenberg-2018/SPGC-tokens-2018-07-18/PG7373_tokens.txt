praise
of
this
book
to
every
honest
reader
that
may
purchase
hire
or
receive
this
book
and
to
the
reviewers
also
to
whom
it
is
of
triple
profit
greeting
and
whatever
else
can
be
had
for
nothing
if
you
should
ask
how
this
book
came
to
be
written
it
was
in
this
way
one
day
as
i
was
wandering
over
the
world
i
came
upon
the
valley
where
i
was
born
and
stopping
there
a
moment
to
speak
with
them
all
when
i
had
argued
politics
with
the
grocer
and
played
the
great
lord
with
the
and
had
all
but
made
the
carpenter
a
christian
by
force
of
rhetoric
what
should
i
note
after
so
many
years
but
the
old
and
gaping
church
that
i
love
more
than
herself
all
scraped
white
rebuilt
noble
and
new
as
though
it
had
been
finished
yesterday
knowing
very
well
that
such
a
change
had
not
come
from
the
skinflint
populace
but
was
the
work
of
some
just
artist
who
knew
how
grand
an
ornament
was
this
shrine
built
there
before
our
people
stormed
jerusalem
i
entered
and
there
saw
that
all
within
was
as
new
accurate
and
excellent
as
the
outer
part
and
this
pleased
me
as
much
as
though
a
fortune
had
been
left
to
us
all
for
one
native
place
is
the
shell
of
soul
and
one
church
is
the
kernel
of
that
nut
moreover
saying
my
prayers
there
i
noticed
behind
the
high
altar
a
statue
of
our
lady
so
extraordinary
and
so
different
from
all
i
had
ever
seen
before
so
much
the
spirit
of
my
valley
that
i
was
quite
taken
out
of
myself
and
vowed
a
vow
there
to
go
to
rome
on
pilgrimage
and
see
all
europe
which
the
christian
faith
has
saved
and
i
said
will
start
from
the
place
where
i
served
in
arms
for
my
sins
i
will
walk
all
the
way
and
take
advantage
of
no
wheeled
thing
i
will
sleep
rough
and
cover
thirty
miles
a
day
and
i
will
hear
mass
every
morning
and
i
will
be
present
at
high
mass
in
st
peter
on
the
feast
of
st
peter
and
st
paul
then
i
went
out
of
the
church
still
having
that
statue
in
my
mind
and
i
walked
again
farther
into
the
world
away
from
my
native
valley
and
so
ended
some
months
after
in
a
place
whence
i
could
fulfil
my
vow
and
i
started
as
you
shall
hear
all
my
other
vows
i
broke
one
by
one
for
a
faggot
must
be
broken
every
stick
singly
but
the
strict
vow
i
kept
for
i
entered
rome
on
foot
that
year
in
time
and
i
heard
high
mass
on
the
feast
of
the
apostles
as
many
can
testify
to
wit
monsignor
this
and
chamberlain
the
other
and
the
bishop
of
o
polis
in
partibus
infidelium
for
we
were
all
there
together
and
why
you
will
say
is
all
this
put
by
itself
in
what
call
a
foreword
but
gentlemen
a
preface
why
it
is
because
i
have
noticed
that
no
book
can
appear
without
some
such
thing
tied
on
before
it
and
as
it
is
folly
to
neglect
the
fashion
be
certain
that
i
read
some
eight
or
nine
thousand
of
them
to
be
sure
of
how
they
were
written
and
to
be
safe
from
generalizing
on
too
frail
a
basis
and
having
read
them
and
discovered
first
that
it
was
the
custom
of
my
contemporaries
to
belaud
themselves
in
this
prolegomenaical
ritual
some
saying
in
a
few
words
that
they
supplied
a
want
others
boasting
in
a
hundred
that
they
were
too
grand
to
do
any
such
thing
but
most
of
them
baritoning
their
apologies
and
chanting
their
excuses
till
one
knew
that
their
pride
was
toppling
over
since
i
say
it
seemed
a
necessity
to
extol
one
work
i
wrote
simply
on
the
lintel
of
my
diary
of
this
book
so
as
to
end
the
matter
at
a
blow
but
whether
there
will
be
praise
or
blame
i
really
can
not
tell
for
i
am
riding
my
pen
on
the
snaffle
and
it
has
a
mouth
of
iron
now
there
is
another
thing
book
writers
do
in
their
prefaces
which
is
to
introduce
a
mass
of
nincompoops
of
whom
no
one
ever
heard
and
to
say
thanks
are
due
to
such
and
such
all
in
a
litany
as
though
any
one
cared
a
farthing
for
the
rats
if
i
omit
this
believe
me
it
is
but
on
account
of
the
multitude
and
splendour
of
those
who
have
attended
at
the
production
of
this
volume
for
the
stories
in
it
are
copied
straight
from
the
best
authors
of
the
renaissance
the
music
was
written
by
the
masters
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
latin
is
erasmus
own
indeed
there
is
scarcely
a
word
that
is
mine
i
must
also
mention
the
nine
muses
the
three
graces
bacchus
the
maenads
the
panthers
the
fauns
and
i
owe
very
hearty
thanks
to
apollo
yet
again
i
see
that
writers
are
for
ever
anxious
of
their
style
thinking
not
saying
i
used
and
which
on
page
but
martha
brown
the
stylist
gave
me
leave
or
if
i
do
end
a
sentence
with
a
preposition
i
always
follow
the
rules
of
mr
twist
in
his
is
thus
was
spoke
odd
body
an
i
do
not
now
this
is
a
pusillanimity
of
theirs
the
book
writers
that
they
think
style
power
and
yet
never
say
as
much
in
their
prefaces
come
let
me
do
so
where
are
you
let
me
marshal
you
my
regiments
of
words
rabelais
master
of
all
happy
men
are
you
sleeping
there
pressed
into
desecrated
earth
under
the
of
the
rue
st
paul
or
do
you
not
rather
drink
cool
wine
in
some
elysian
chinon
looking
on
the
vienne
where
it
rises
in
paradise
are
you
sleeping
or
drinking
that
you
will
not
lend
us
the
staff
of
friar
john
wherewith
he
slaughtered
and
bashed
the
invaders
of
the
vineyards
who
are
but
a
parable
for
the
mincing
pedants
and
bloodless
rogues
of
the
world
write
as
the
wind
blows
and
command
all
words
like
an
army
see
them
how
they
stand
in
rank
ready
for
assault
the
jolly
swaggering
fellows
first
come
the
neologisms
that
are
afraid
of
no
man
fresh
young
hearty
and
for
the
most
part
very
though
some
few
short
and
strong
there
also
are
the
misprints
to
confuse
the
enemy
at
his
onrush
then
see
upon
the
flank
a
company
of
picked
ambiguities
covering
what
shall
be
a
feint
by
the
squadron
of
anachronisms
led
by
old
anachronos
himself
a
terrible
chap
with
nigglers
and
a
great
murderer
of
fools
but
here
see
more
deeply
massed
the
ten
thousand
egotisms
shining
in
their
armour
and
roaring
for
battle
they
care
for
no
one
they
stormed
convention
yesterday
and
looted
the
cellar
of
who
died
of
fear
without
a
wound
so
they
drank
his
wine
and
are
as
strong
as
lions
and
as
careless
saving
only
their
captain
monologue
who
is
here
are
the
aposiopaesian
auxiliaries
and
dithyramb
that
killed
punctuation
in
open
fight
parenthesis
the
giant
and
champion
of
the
host
and
anacoluthon
that
never
learned
to
read
or
write
but
is
very
handy
with
his
sword
and
metathesis
and
hendiadys
two
greeks
and
last
come
the
noble
gallicisms
prancing
about
on
their
light
horses
cavalry
so
sudden
that
the
enemy
sicken
at
the
mere
sight
of
them
and
are
overcome
without
a
blow
come
then
my
hearties
my
lads
my
indefatigable
repetitions
seize
you
each
his
own
trumpet
that
hangs
at
his
side
and
blow
the
charge
we
shall
soon
drive
them
all
before
us
headlong
howling
down
together
to
the
picrocholian
sea
so
that
was
an
interlude
forget
the
clamour
but
there
is
another
matter
written
as
yet
in
no
other
preface
peculiar
to
this
book
for
without
rhyme
or
reason
pictures
of
an
uncertain
kind
stand
in
the
pages
of
the
chronicle
why
it
has
become
so
cheap
to
photograph
on
in
old
time
a
man
that
drew
ill
drew
not
at
all
he
did
well
then
either
there
were
no
pictures
in
his
book
or
if
there
were
any
they
were
done
by
some
other
man
that
loved
him
not
a
groat
and
would
not
have
walked
half
a
mile
to
see
him
hanged
but
now
it
is
so
easy
for
a
man
to
scratch
down
what
he
sees
and
put
it
in
his
book
that
any
fool
may
do
it
and
be
none
the
worse
many
others
shall
follow
this
is
the
first
before
you
blame
too
much
consider
the
alternative
shall
a
man
march
through
europe
dragging
an
artist
on
a
cord
god
forbid
shall
an
artist
write
a
book
why
no
the
remedy
is
worse
than
the
disease
let
us
agree
then
that
if
he
will
any
pilgrim
may
for
the
future
draw
if
he
likes
that
most
difficult
subject
snow
hills
beyond
a
grove
of
trees
that
he
may
draw
whatever
he
comes
across
in
order
to
enliven
his
mind
for
who
saw
it
if
not
he
and
was
it
not
his
loneliness
that
enabled
him
to
see
it
and
that
he
may
draw
what
he
never
saw
with
as
much
freedom
as
you
readers
so
very
continually
see
what
you
never
draw
he
may
draw
the
morning
mist
on
the
grimsel
six
months
afterwards
when
he
has
forgotten
what
it
was
like
and
he
may
frame
it
for
a
masterpiece
to
make
the
good
draughtsman
rage
the
world
has
grown
a
boy
again
this
long
time
past
and
they
are
building
hotels
i
hear
in
the
place
where
acedes
discovered
the
water
of
youth
in
a
hollow
of
the
hill
epistemonoscoptes
then
let
us
love
one
another
and
laugh
time
passes
and
we
shall
soon
laugh
no
longer
and
meanwhile
common
living
is
a
burden
and
earnest
men
are
at
siege
upon
us
all
around
let
us
suffer
absurdities
for
that
is
only
to
suffer
one
another
nor
let
us
be
too
hard
upon
the
just
but
anxious
fellow
that
sat
down
dutifully
to
paint
the
soul
of
switzerland
upon
a
fan
when
that
first
who
has
imposed
upon
all
peoples
by
his
epigrams
and
his
fallacious
his
empiricism
and
his
wanton
appeals
to
popular
ignorance
i
say
when
this
man
for
i
take
it
he
was
a
man
and
a
wicked
one
was
passing
through
france
he
launched
among
the
french
one
of
his
pestiferous
phrases
que
le
premier
pas
qui
and
this
in
a
kind
of
a
manner
has
been
repeated
since
his
day
at
least
seventeen
million
three
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
and
four
times
by
a
great
mass
of
ushers
parents
company
officers
elder
brothers
parish
priests
and
authorities
in
general
whose
office
it
may
be
and
whose
pleasure
it
certainly
is
to
jog
up
and
disturb
that
native
slumber
and
inertia
of
the
mind
which
is
the
true
breeding
soil
of
revelation
for
when
boys
or
soldiers
or
poets
or
any
other
blossoms
and
prides
of
nature
are
for
lying
steady
in
the
shade
and
letting
the
mind
commune
with
its
immortal
comrades
up
comes
authority
busking
about
and
eager
as
though
it
were
a
duty
to
force
the
said
mind
to
burrow
and
sweat
in
the
matter
of
this
very
perishable
world
its
temporary
habitation
says
authority
let
me
see
that
mind
of
yours
doing
something
practical
let
me
see
him
mixing
painfully
with
circumstance
and
botching
up
some
imperfection
or
other
that
shall
at
least
be
a
reality
and
not
a
silly
fantasy
then
the
poor
mind
comes
back
to
prison
again
and
the
boy
takes
his
horrible
homer
in
the
real
greek
not
church
book
alas
the
poet
his
rough
hairy
paper
his
headache
and
his
pen
the
soldier
abandons
his
inner
picture
of
swaggering
about
in
ordinary
clothes
and
sees
the
dusty
road
and
feels
the
hard
places
in
his
boot
and
shakes
down
again
to
the
steady
pressure
of
his
pack
and
authority
is
satisfied
knowing
that
he
will
get
a
smattering
from
the
boy
a
rubbishy
verse
from
the
poet
and
from
the
soldier
a
long
and
thirsty
march
and
authority
when
it
does
this
commonly
sets
to
work
by
one
of
these
formulae
as
in
england
north
of
trent
by
the
manifestly
false
and
boastful
phrase
thing
begun
is
half
ended
and
in
the
south
by
beginning
is
half
the
battle
but
in
france
by
the
words
i
have
attributed
to
the
que
le
premier
pas
qui
by
this
you
may
perceive
that
the
like
every
other
demagogue
energumen
and
disturber
dealt
largely
in
metaphor
but
this
i
need
hardly
insist
upon
for
in
his
vast
collection
of
published
and
unpublished
works
it
is
amply
evident
that
he
took
the
silly
pride
of
the
in
a
constant
abuse
of
metaphor
there
was
a
sturdy
boy
at
my
school
who
when
the
master
had
carefully
explained
to
us
the
nature
of
metaphor
said
that
so
far
as
he
could
see
a
metaphor
was
nothing
but
a
long
greek
word
for
a
lie
and
certainly
men
who
know
that
the
mere
truth
would
be
distasteful
or
tedious
commonly
have
recourse
to
metaphor
and
so
do
those
false
men
who
desire
to
acquire
a
subtle
and
unjust
influence
over
their
fellows
and
chief
among
them
the
for
though
his
name
is
lost
in
the
great
space
of
time
that
has
passed
since
he
flourished
yet
his
character
can
be
very
clearly
deduced
from
the
many
literary
fragments
he
has
left
and
that
is
found
to
be
the
character
of
a
pusillanimous
and
usurer
wholly
lacking
in
foresight
in
generous
enterprise
and
chivalrous
enthusiasm
in
matters
of
the
faith
a
prig
or
a
doubter
in
matters
of
adventure
a
poltroon
in
matters
of
science
an
ignorant
parrot
and
in
letters
a
wretchedly
bad
rhymester
with
a
vice
for
alliteration
a
wilful
liar
as
for
instance
longest
way
round
is
the
shortest
way
a
startling
miser
as
penny
saved
is
a
penny
one
ignorant
of
largesse
and
human
charity
as
not
want
and
a
shocking
boor
in
the
point
of
honour
as
words
break
no
he
never
fought
i
see
but
with
a
cudgel
but
he
had
just
that
touch
of
slinking
humour
which
the
peasants
have
and
there
is
in
all
he
said
that
exasperating
quality
for
which
we
have
no
name
which
certainly
is
not
accuracy
and
which
is
quite
the
opposite
of
judgement
yet
which
catches
the
mind
as
brambles
do
our
clothes
causing
us
continually
to
pause
and
swear
for
he
mixes
up
unanswerable
things
with
false
conclusions
he
is
perpetually
letting
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
and
exposing
our
tricks
putting
a
colour
to
our
actions
disturbing
us
with
our
own
memory
indecently
revealing
corners
of
the
soul
he
is
like
those
men
who
say
one
unpleasant
and
rude
thing
about
a
friend
and
then
take
refuge
from
their
disloyal
and
false
action
by
pleading
that
this
single
accusation
is
true
and
it
is
perhaps
for
this
abominable
logicality
of
his
and
for
his
malicious
cunning
that
i
chiefly
hate
him
and
since
he
himself
evidently
hated
the
human
race
he
must
not
complain
if
he
is
hated
in
return
take
for
instance
this
phrase
that
set
me
writing
nest
que
le
premier
pas
qui
it
is
false
much
after
a
beginning
is
difficult
as
everybody
knows
who
has
crossed
the
sea
and
as
for
the
first
a
man
never
so
much
as
remembers
it
if
there
is
difficulty
it
is
in
the
whole
launching
of
a
thing
in
the
first
ten
pages
of
a
book
or
the
first
of
listening
to
a
sermon
or
the
first
mile
of
a
walk
the
first
step
is
undertaken
lightly
pleasantly
and
with
your
soul
in
the
sky
it
is
the
that
counts
but
i
know
and
you
know
and
he
knew
worse
luck
that
he
was
saying
a
thorny
and
catching
thing
when
he
made
up
that
phrase
it
worries
one
of
set
purpose
it
is
as
though
one
had
a
voice
inside
one
saying
know
you
you
will
never
begin
anything
look
at
what
you
might
have
done
here
you
are
already
and
you
have
not
yet
written
a
dictionary
what
will
you
do
for
fame
eh
nothing
you
are
intolerably
lazy
and
what
is
worse
it
is
your
fate
beginnings
are
insuperable
barriers
to
you
what
about
that
great
work
on
the
national
debt
what
about
that
little
lyric
on
winchelsea
that
you
thought
of
writing
six
years
ago
why
are
the
few
lines
still
in
your
head
and
not
on
paper
because
you
ca
begin
however
never
mind
you
ca
help
it
it
your
one
great
flaw
and
it
fatal
look
at
jones
younger
than
you
by
half
a
year
and
already
on
the
taking
bribes
from
company
promoters
and
where
are
you
and
so
forth
so
this
threat
about
the
heavy
task
of
beginning
breeds
discouragement
anger
vexation
irritability
bad
style
pomposity
and
infinitives
split
from
helm
to
saddle
and
metaphors
as
mixed
as
the
carlton
but
it
is
just
true
enough
to
remain
fast
in
the
mind
caught
as
it
were
by
one
finger
for
all
things
you
will
notice
are
very
difficult
in
their
origin
and
why
no
one
can
understand
they
are
difficult
also
in
the
shock
of
maturity
and
in
their
ending
take
for
instance
the
life
of
man
which
is
the
difficulty
of
birth
the
difficulty
of
death
and
the
difficulty
of
the
grand
climacteric
lector
what
is
the
grand
climacteric
auctor
i
have
no
time
to
tell
you
for
it
would
lead
us
into
a
discussion
on
astrology
and
then
perhaps
to
a
question
of
physical
science
and
then
you
would
find
i
was
not
orthodox
and
perhaps
denounce
me
to
the
authorities
i
will
tell
you
this
much
it
is
the
moment
not
the
year
or
the
month
mind
you
nor
even
the
hour
but
the
very
second
when
a
man
is
grown
up
when
he
sees
things
as
they
are
that
is
backwards
and
feels
solidly
himself
do
i
make
myself
clear
no
matter
it
is
the
shock
of
maturity
and
that
must
suffice
for
you
but
perhaps
you
have
been
reading
little
brown
books
on
evolution
and
you
do
believe
in
catastrophes
or
climaxes
or
definitions
eh
tell
me
do
you
believe
in
the
peak
of
the
matterhorn
and
have
you
doubts
on
the
points
of
needles
can
the
sun
be
said
truly
to
rise
or
set
and
is
there
any
exact
meaning
in
the
phrase
to
a
turn
as
applied
to
omelettes
you
know
there
is
and
so
also
you
must
believe
in
categories
and
you
must
admit
differences
of
kind
as
well
as
of
degree
and
you
must
accept
exact
definition
and
believe
in
all
that
your
fathers
did
that
were
wiser
men
than
you
as
is
easily
proved
if
you
will
but
imagine
yourself
for
but
one
moment
introduced
into
the
presence
of
your
ancestors
and
ask
yourself
which
would
look
the
fool
especially
must
you
believe
in
moments
and
their
importance
and
avoid
with
the
utmost
care
the
comparative
method
and
the
argument
of
the
slowly
accumulating
heap
i
hear
that
some
scientists
are
already
beginning
to
admit
the
reality
of
birth
and
death
let
but
some
brave
few
make
an
act
of
faith
in
the
grand
climacteric
and
all
shall
yet
be
well
well
as
i
was
saying
this
difficulty
of
beginning
is
but
one
of
three
and
is
inexplicable
and
is
in
the
nature
of
things
and
it
is
very
especially
noticeable
in
the
art
of
letters
there
is
in
every
book
the
difficulty
of
beginning
the
difficulty
of
the
which
is
the
grand
climacteric
of
a
book
lector
what
is
that
in
a
book
auctor
why
it
is
the
point
where
the
reader
has
caught
on
enters
into
the
book
and
desires
to
continue
reading
it
lector
it
comes
earlier
in
some
books
than
in
others
auctor
as
you
say
and
finally
there
is
the
difficulty
of
ending
lector
i
do
not
see
how
there
can
be
any
difficulty
in
ending
a
book
auctor
that
shows
very
clearly
that
you
have
never
written
one
for
there
is
nothing
so
hard
in
the
writing
of
a
book
no
not
even
the
choice
of
the
dedication
as
is
the
ending
of
it
on
this
account
only
the
great
poets
who
are
above
custom
and
can
snap
their
divine
fingers
at
forms
are
not
at
the
pains
of
devising
careful
endings
thus
homer
ends
with
lines
that
might
as
well
be
in
the
middle
of
a
passage
hesiod
i
know
not
how
and
mr
bailey
the
new
voice
from
eurasia
does
not
end
at
all
but
is
still
going
on
panurge
told
me
that
his
great
work
on
conchology
would
never
have
been
finished
had
it
not
been
for
the
bookseller
that
threatened
law
and
as
it
is
the
last
sentence
has
no
verb
in
it
there
is
always
something
more
to
be
said
and
it
is
always
so
difficult
to
turn
up
the
splice
neatly
at
the
edges
on
this
account
there
are
regular
models
for
ending
a
book
or
a
poem
as
there
are
for
beginning
one
but
for
my
part
i
think
the
best
way
of
ending
a
book
is
to
rummage
about
among
one
manuscripts
till
one
has
found
a
bit
of
fine
writing
no
matter
upon
what
subject
to
lead
up
the
last
paragraphs
by
no
matter
what
violent
shocks
to
the
thing
it
deals
with
to
introduce
a
row
of
asterisks
and
then
to
paste
on
to
the
paper
below
these
the
piece
of
fine
writing
one
has
found
i
knew
a
man
once
who
always
wrote
the
end
of
a
book
first
when
his
mind
was
fresh
and
so
worked
gradually
back
to
the
introductory
chapter
which
he
said
was
ever
a
kind
of
summary
and
could
not
be
properly
dealt
with
till
a
man
knew
all
about
his
subject
he
said
this
was
a
sovran
way
to
write
history
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
pure
extravagance
for
it
would
lead
one
at
last
to
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
page
like
the
hebrew
bible
and
if
it
were
fully
carried
out
to
writing
sentences
backwards
till
one
had
a
style
like
the
london
school
of
poets
a
very
horrible
conclusion
however
i
am
not
concerned
here
with
the
ending
of
a
book
but
with
its
beginning
and
i
say
that
the
beginning
of
any
literary
thing
is
hard
and
that
this
hardness
is
difficult
to
explain
and
i
say
more
than
this
i
say
that
an
interminable
discussion
of
the
difficulty
of
beginning
a
book
is
the
worst
omen
for
going
on
with
it
and
a
trashy
subterfuge
at
the
best
in
the
name
of
all
decent
common
and
homely
things
why
not
begin
and
have
done
with
it
it
was
in
the
very
beginning
of
june
at
evening
but
not
yet
sunset
that
i
set
out
from
toul
by
the
nancy
gate
but
instead
of
going
straight
on
past
the
i
turned
to
the
right
immediately
along
the
ditch
and
rampart
and
did
not
leave
the
fortifications
till
i
came
to
the
road
that
goes
up
alongside
the
moselle
for
it
was
by
the
valley
of
this
river
that
i
was
to
begin
my
pilgrimage
since
by
a
happy
accident
the
valley
of
the
upper
moselle
runs
straight
towards
rome
though
it
takes
you
but
a
short
part
of
the
way
what
a
good
opening
it
makes
for
a
direct
pilgrimage
can
be
seen
from
this
little
map
where
the
dotted
line
points
exactly
to
rome
there
are
two
bends
which
take
one
a
little
out
of
one
way
and
these
bends
i
attempted
to
avoid
but
in
general
the
valley
about
a
hundred
miles
from
toul
to
the
source
is
an
evident
gate
for
any
one
walking
from
this
part
of
lorraine
into
italy
and
this
map
is
also
useful
to
show
what
route
i
followed
for
my
first
three
days
past
epinal
and
remiremont
up
to
the
source
of
the
river
and
up
over
the
great
hill
the
ballon
i
show
the
river
valley
like
a
trench
and
the
hills
above
it
shaded
till
the
mountainous
upper
part
the
vosges
is
put
in
black
i
chose
the
decline
of
the
day
for
setting
out
because
of
the
great
heat
a
little
before
noon
and
four
hours
after
it
remembering
this
i
planned
to
walk
at
night
and
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
but
how
this
design
turned
out
you
shall
hear
in
a
moment
i
had
not
gone
far
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
my
road
leaving
the
town
when
i
thought
i
would
stop
and
rest
a
little
and
make
sure
that
i
had
started
propitiously
and
that
i
was
really
on
my
way
to
rome
so
i
halted
by
a
wall
and
looked
back
at
the
city
and
the
forts
and
drew
what
i
saw
in
my
book
it
was
a
sight
that
had
taken
a
firm
hold
of
my
mind
in
boyhood
and
that
will
remain
in
it
as
long
as
it
can
make
pictures
for
itself
out
of
the
past
i
think
this
must
be
true
of
all
conscripts
with
regard
to
the
garrison
in
which
they
have
served
for
the
mind
is
so
fresh
at
and
the
life
so
new
to
every
recruit
as
he
joins
it
he
is
so
cut
off
from
books
and
all
the
worries
of
life
that
the
surroundings
of
the
place
bite
into
him
and
take
root
as
one
school
does
or
one
first
home
and
i
had
been
especially
fortunate
since
i
had
been
with
the
gunners
notoriously
the
best
kind
of
men
and
not
in
a
big
place
but
in
a
little
town
very
old
and
silent
with
more
soldiers
in
its
surrounding
circle
than
there
were
men
women
and
children
within
its
useless
ramparts
it
is
known
to
be
very
beautiful
and
though
i
had
not
heard
of
this
reputation
i
saw
it
to
be
so
at
once
when
i
was
first
marched
in
on
a
november
dawn
up
to
the
height
of
the
artillery
barracks
i
remembered
seeing
then
the
great
hills
surrounding
it
on
every
side
hiding
their
menace
and
protection
of
guns
and
in
the
south
and
east
the
silent
valley
where
the
high
forests
dominate
the
moselle
and
the
town
below
the
road
standing
in
an
island
or
ring
of
tall
trees
all
this
i
say
i
had
permanently
remembered
and
i
had
determined
whenever
i
could
go
on
pilgrimage
to
rome
to
make
this
place
my
and
as
i
stopped
here
and
looked
back
a
little
way
outside
the
gates
i
took
in
again
the
scene
that
recalled
so
much
laughter
and
heavy
work
and
servitude
and
pride
of
arms
i
was
looking
straight
at
the
great
fort
of
st
michel
which
is
the
strongest
thing
on
the
frontier
and
which
is
the
key
to
the
circle
of
forts
that
make
up
this
entrenched
camp
one
could
see
little
or
nothing
of
its
batteries
only
its
hundreds
of
feet
of
steep
brushwood
above
the
vineyards
and
at
the
summit
a
stunted
wood
purposely
planted
next
to
it
on
the
left
of
equal
height
was
the
hog
back
of
the
cote
barine
hiding
a
battery
between
the
cote
barine
and
my
road
and
wall
i
saw
the
rising
ground
and
the
familiar
barracks
that
are
called
i
know
not
why
the
barracks
of
justice
but
ought
more
properly
to
be
called
the
barracks
of
petty
tyrannies
and
good
fellowship
in
order
to
show
the
philosophers
that
these
two
things
are
the
life
of
armies
for
of
all
the
virtues
practised
in
that
old
compulsory
home
of
mine
justice
came
second
at
least
if
not
third
while
discipline
and
comradeship
went
first
and
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
of
all
the
suffering
youth
that
was
being
there
annealed
and
forged
into
soldiery
none
can
have
suffered
like
the
lawyers
on
the
right
the
high
trees
that
stand
outside
the
ramparts
of
the
town
went
dwindling
in
perspective
like
a
palisade
and
above
them
here
and
there
was
a
roof
showing
the
top
of
the
towers
of
the
cathedral
or
of
st
gengoult
all
this
i
saw
looking
backwards
and
when
i
had
noticed
it
and
drawn
it
i
turned
round
again
and
took
the
road
i
had
in
a
small
bag
or
pocket
slung
over
my
shoulder
a
large
piece
of
bread
half
a
pound
of
smoked
ham
a
two
nationalist
papers
and
a
quart
of
the
wine
of
brule
which
is
the
most
famous
wine
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
garrison
yet
very
cheap
and
brule
is
a
very
good
omen
for
men
that
are
battered
about
and
given
to
despairing
since
it
is
only
called
brule
on
account
of
its
having
been
burnt
so
often
by
romans
frenchmen
burgundians
germans
flemings
huns
perhaps
and
generally
all
those
who
in
the
last
few
thousand
years
have
taken
a
short
cut
at
their
enemies
over
the
neck
of
the
cote
barine
so
you
would
imagine
it
to
be
a
weak
wretched
and
disappearing
place
but
so
far
from
this
it
is
a
rich
and
proud
village
growing
as
i
have
said
better
wine
than
any
in
the
garrison
though
toul
stands
in
a
great
cup
or
ring
of
hills
very
high
and
with
steep
slopes
and
guns
on
all
of
them
and
all
these
hills
grow
wine
none
is
so
good
as
brule
wine
and
this
reminds
me
of
a
thing
that
happened
in
the
manoeuvres
of
pars
for
there
were
two
divisions
employed
in
that
glorious
and
fatiguing
great
game
and
more
than
a
gross
of
guns
to
be
accurate
a
hundred
and
and
of
these
one
the
sixth
piece
of
the
tenth
battery
of
the
eighth
i
wonder
where
you
all
are
now
i
suppose
i
shall
not
see
you
again
but
you
were
the
best
companions
in
the
world
my
friends
was
driven
by
three
drivers
of
whom
i
was
the
middle
one
and
the
worst
having
on
my
livret
the
note
mediocre
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
story
is
as
follows
and
the
moral
is
that
the
commercial
mind
is
illogical
when
we
had
gone
some
way
clattering
through
the
dust
and
were
well
on
on
the
commercy
road
there
was
a
short
halt
and
during
this
halt
there
passed
us
the
largest
tun
or
barrel
that
ever
went
on
wheels
you
talk
of
the
great
tun
of
heidelburg
or
of
those
monstrous
vats
that
stand
in
cool
sheds
in
the
napa
valley
or
of
the
vast
barrels
in
the
catacombs
of
rheims
but
all
these
are
built
and
meant
to
remain
steady
and
there
is
no
limit
to
the
size
of
a
barrel
that
has
not
to
travel
the
point
about
this
enormous
receptacle
of
bacchus
and
cavernous
huge
prison
of
laughter
was
that
it
could
move
though
cumbrously
and
it
was
drawn
very
slowly
by
stupid
patient
oxen
who
would
not
be
hurried
on
the
top
of
it
sat
a
strong
peasant
with
a
face
of
determination
as
though
he
were
at
war
with
his
kind
and
he
kept
on
calling
to
his
oxen
and
in
the
tones
of
a
sullen
challenge
as
he
went
creaking
past
then
the
soldiers
began
calling
out
to
him
singly
are
you
off
to
father
with
that
battery
and
carry
cold
water
to
commercy
they
have
only
too
much
as
it
is
and
have
you
got
in
the
little
barrelkin
the
barrellet
the
cantiniere
the
gourd
the
firkin
he
stopped
his
oxen
fiercely
and
turned
round
to
us
and
said
will
tell
you
what
i
have
here
i
have
so
many
hectolitres
of
brule
wine
which
i
made
myself
and
which
i
know
to
be
the
best
wine
there
is
and
i
am
taking
it
about
to
see
if
i
can
not
tame
and
break
these
proud
fellows
who
are
for
ever
beating
down
prices
and
mocking
me
it
is
worth
eight
the
hectolitre
that
is
eight
sols
the
litre
what
do
i
say
it
is
worth
a
louis
a
cup
but
i
will
sell
it
at
the
price
i
name
and
not
a
penny
less
but
whenever
i
come
to
a
village
the
innkeeper
begins
bargaining
and
chaffering
and
offering
six
sols
and
seven
sols
and
i
answer
eight
sols
take
it
or
leave
it
and
when
he
seems
for
haggling
again
i
get
up
and
drive
away
i
know
the
worth
of
my
wine
and
i
will
not
be
beaten
down
though
i
have
to
go
out
of
lorraine
into
the
barrois
to
sell
it
so
when
we
caught
him
up
again
as
we
did
shortly
after
on
the
road
a
sergeant
cried
as
we
passed
will
give
you
seven
seven
and
a
quarter
seven
and
a
half
and
we
went
on
laughing
and
forgot
all
about
him
for
many
days
we
marched
from
this
place
to
that
place
and
fired
and
played
a
confused
game
in
the
hot
sun
till
the
train
of
sick
horses
was
a
mile
long
and
till
the
recruits
were
all
as
deaf
as
so
many
posts
and
at
last
one
evening
we
came
to
a
place
called
heiltz
le
maurupt
which
was
like
heaven
after
the
hot
plain
and
the
dust
and
whose
inhabitants
are
as
good
and
hospitable
as
angels
it
is
just
where
the
champagne
begins
when
we
had
groomed
and
watered
our
horses
and
the
stable
guard
had
been
set
and
we
had
all
an
hour
or
so
leisure
to
stroll
about
in
the
cool
darkness
before
sleeping
in
the
barns
we
had
a
sudden
lesson
in
the
smallness
of
the
world
for
what
should
come
up
the
village
street
but
that
monstrous
barrel
and
we
could
see
by
its
movements
that
it
was
still
quite
full
we
gathered
round
the
peasant
and
told
him
how
grieved
we
were
at
his
ill
fortune
and
agreed
with
him
that
all
the
people
of
the
barrois
were
thieves
or
madmen
not
to
buy
such
wine
for
such
a
song
he
took
his
oxen
and
his
barrel
to
a
very
high
shed
that
stood
by
and
there
he
told
us
all
his
pilgrimage
and
the
many
assaults
his
firmness
suffered
and
how
he
had
resisted
them
all
there
was
much
more
anger
than
sorrow
in
his
accent
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
of
the
wood
from
which
tyrants
and
martyrs
are
carved
then
suddenly
he
changed
and
became
eloquent
the
good
wine
if
only
it
were
known
and
tasted
here
give
me
a
cup
and
i
will
ask
some
of
you
to
taste
it
then
at
least
i
shall
have
it
praised
as
it
deserves
and
this
is
the
wine
i
have
carried
more
than
a
hundred
miles
and
everywhere
it
has
been
refused
there
was
one
guttering
candle
on
a
little
stool
the
roof
of
the
shed
was
lost
up
in
the
great
height
of
darkness
behind
in
the
darkness
the
oxen
champed
away
steadily
in
the
manger
the
light
from
the
candle
flame
lit
his
face
strongly
from
beneath
and
marked
it
with
dark
shadows
it
flickered
on
the
circle
of
our
faces
as
we
pressed
round
and
it
came
slantwise
and
waned
and
disappeared
in
the
immense
length
of
the
barrel
he
stood
near
the
tap
with
his
brows
knit
as
upon
some
very
important
task
and
all
we
gunners
and
drivers
of
the
battery
began
unhooking
our
mugs
and
passing
them
to
him
there
were
nearly
a
hundred
and
he
filled
them
all
not
in
jollity
but
like
a
man
offering
up
a
solemn
sacrifice
we
also
entering
into
his
mood
passed
our
mugs
continually
thanking
him
in
a
low
tone
and
keeping
in
the
main
silent
a
few
linesmen
lounged
at
the
door
he
asked
for
their
cups
and
filled
them
he
bade
them
fetch
as
many
of
their
comrades
as
cared
to
come
and
very
soon
there
was
a
circulating
crowd
of
men
all
getting
wine
of
brule
and
murmuring
their
congratulations
and
he
was
willing
enough
to
go
on
giving
but
we
stopped
when
we
saw
fit
and
the
scene
ended
i
can
not
tell
what
prodigious
measure
of
wine
he
gave
away
to
us
all
that
night
but
when
he
struck
the
roof
of
the
cask
it
already
sounded
hollow
and
when
we
had
made
a
collection
which
he
had
refused
he
went
to
sleep
by
his
oxen
and
we
to
our
straw
in
other
barns
next
day
we
started
before
dawn
and
i
never
saw
him
again
this
is
the
story
of
the
wine
of
brule
and
it
shows
that
what
men
love
is
never
money
itself
but
their
own
way
and
that
human
beings
love
sympathy
and
pageant
above
all
things
it
also
teaches
us
not
to
be
hard
on
the
rich
i
walked
along
the
valley
of
the
moselle
and
as
i
walked
the
long
evening
of
summer
began
to
fall
the
sky
was
empty
and
its
deeps
infinite
the
clearness
of
the
air
set
me
dreaming
i
passed
the
turn
where
we
used
to
halt
when
we
were
learning
how
to
ride
in
front
of
the
guns
past
the
little
house
where
on
rare
holidays
the
boys
could
eat
a
matelote
which
is
fish
boiled
in
wine
and
so
on
to
the
place
where
the
river
is
held
by
a
weir
and
opens
out
into
a
kind
of
lake
here
i
waited
for
a
moment
by
the
wooden
railing
and
looked
up
into
the
hills
so
far
i
had
been
at
home
and
i
was
now
poring
upon
the
last
familiar
thing
before
i
ventured
into
the
high
woods
and
began
my
experience
i
therefore
took
a
leisurely
farewell
and
pondered
instead
of
walking
farther
everything
about
me
conduced
to
reminiscence
and
to
ease
a
flock
of
sheep
passed
me
with
their
shepherd
who
gave
me
a
i
found
myself
entering
that
pleasant
mood
in
which
all
books
are
conceived
but
none
written
i
was
the
enchanted
cigarettes
of
balzac
and
if
this
kind
of
reverie
is
fatal
to
action
yet
it
is
so
much
a
factor
of
happiness
that
i
wasted
in
the
contemplation
of
that
lovely
and
silent
hollow
many
miles
of
marching
i
suppose
if
a
man
were
altogether
his
own
master
and
controlled
by
no
necessity
not
even
the
necessity
of
expression
all
his
life
would
pass
away
in
these
sublime
imaginings
this
was
a
place
i
remembered
very
well
the
rising
river
of
lorraine
is
caught
and
barred
and
it
spreads
in
a
great
sheet
of
water
that
must
be
very
shallow
but
that
in
its
reflections
and
serenity
resembles
rather
a
profound
and
silent
mere
the
steeps
surrounding
it
are
nearly
mountainous
and
are
crowned
with
deep
forests
in
which
the
province
reposes
and
upon
which
it
depends
for
its
local
genius
a
little
village
which
we
used
to
call
peter
of
the
quarries
lies
up
on
the
right
between
the
steep
and
the
water
and
just
where
the
hills
end
a
flat
that
was
once
marshy
and
is
now
half
fields
half
ponds
but
broken
with
luxuriant
trees
marks
the
great
age
of
its
civilization
along
this
flat
runs
bordered
with
rare
poplars
the
road
which
one
can
follow
on
and
on
into
the
heart
of
the
vosges
i
took
from
this
silence
and
this
vast
plain
of
still
water
the
repose
that
introduces
night
it
was
all
consonant
with
what
the
peasants
were
about
the
return
from
labour
the
bleating
folds
and
the
lighting
of
lamps
under
the
eaves
in
such
a
spirit
i
passed
along
the
upper
valley
to
the
spring
of
the
hills
in
st
pierre
it
was
just
that
passing
of
daylight
when
a
man
thinks
he
can
still
read
when
the
buildings
and
the
bridges
are
great
masses
of
purple
that
deceive
one
recalling
the
details
of
daylight
but
when
the
night
birds
surer
than
men
and
less
troubled
by
this
illusion
of
memory
have
discovered
that
their
darkness
has
conquered
the
peasants
sat
outside
their
houses
in
the
twilight
accepting
the
cool
air
every
one
spoke
to
me
as
i
marched
through
and
i
answered
them
all
nor
was
there
in
any
of
their
salutations
the
omission
of
good
fellowship
or
of
the
name
of
god
saving
with
one
man
who
was
a
sergeant
of
artillery
on
leave
and
who
cried
out
to
me
in
an
accent
that
was
very
familiar
and
asked
me
to
drink
but
i
told
him
i
had
to
go
up
into
the
forest
to
take
advantage
of
the
night
since
the
days
were
so
warm
for
walking
as
i
left
the
last
house
of
the
village
i
was
not
secure
from
loneliness
and
when
the
road
began
to
climb
up
the
hill
into
the
wild
and
the
trees
i
was
wondering
how
the
night
would
pass
with
every
step
upward
a
greater
mystery
surrounded
me
a
few
stars
were
out
and
the
brown
night
mist
was
creeping
along
the
water
below
but
there
was
still
light
enough
to
see
the
road
and
even
to
distinguish
the
bracken
in
the
deserted
hollows
the
highway
became
little
better
than
a
lane
at
the
top
of
the
hill
it
plunged
under
tall
pines
and
was
vaulted
over
with
darkness
the
kingdoms
that
have
no
walls
and
are
built
up
of
shadows
began
to
oppress
me
as
the
night
hardened
had
i
had
companions
still
we
would
only
have
spoken
in
a
whisper
and
in
that
dungeon
of
trees
even
my
own
self
would
not
raise
its
voice
within
me
it
was
full
night
when
i
had
reached
a
vague
clearing
in
the
woods
right
up
on
the
height
of
that
flat
hill
this
clearing
was
called
fountain
of
magdalen
i
was
so
far
relieved
by
the
broader
sky
of
the
open
field
that
i
could
wait
and
rest
a
little
and
there
at
last
separate
from
men
i
thought
of
a
thousand
things
the
air
was
full
of
midsummer
and
its
mixture
of
exaltation
and
fear
cut
me
off
from
ordinary
living
i
now
understood
why
our
religion
has
made
sacred
this
season
of
the
year
why
we
have
a
little
later
the
night
of
st
john
the
fires
in
the
villages
and
the
old
perception
of
fairies
dancing
in
the
rings
of
the
summer
grass
a
general
communion
of
all
things
conspires
at
this
crisis
of
summer
against
us
reasoning
men
that
should
live
in
the
daylight
and
something
fantastic
possesses
those
who
are
foolish
enough
to
watch
upon
such
nights
so
i
watching
was
cut
off
there
were
huge
vague
summits
all
wooded
peering
above
the
field
i
sat
in
but
they
merged
into
a
confused
horizon
i
was
on
a
high
plateau
yet
i
felt
myself
to
be
alone
with
the
immensity
that
properly
belongs
to
plains
alone
i
saw
the
stars
and
remembered
how
i
had
looked
up
at
them
on
just
such
a
night
when
i
was
close
to
the
pacific
bereft
of
friends
and
possessed
with
solitude
there
was
no
noise
it
was
full
darkness
the
woods
before
and
behind
me
made
a
square
frame
of
silence
and
i
was
enchased
here
in
the
clearing
thinking
of
all
things
then
a
little
wind
passed
over
the
vast
forests
of
lorraine
it
seemed
to
wake
an
indefinite
sly
life
proper
to
this
seclusion
a
life
to
which
i
was
strange
and
which
thought
me
an
invader
yet
i
heard
nothing
there
were
no
adders
in
the
long
grass
nor
any
frogs
in
that
dry
square
of
land
nor
crickets
on
the
high
part
of
the
hill
but
i
knew
that
little
creatures
in
league
with
every
nocturnal
influence
enemies
of
the
sun
occupied
the
air
and
the
land
about
me
nor
will
i
deny
that
i
felt
a
rebel
knowing
well
that
men
were
made
to
work
in
happy
dawns
and
to
sleep
in
the
night
and
everything
in
that
short
and
sacred
darkness
multiplied
my
attentiveness
and
my
illusion
perhaps
the
instincts
of
the
sentry
the
necessities
of
guard
come
back
to
us
out
of
the
ages
unawares
during
such
experiments
at
any
rate
the
night
oppressed
and
exalted
me
then
i
suddenly
attributed
such
exaltation
to
the
need
of
food
we
must
try
this
bookish
plan
of
sleeping
by
day
and
walking
by
night
i
thought
least
one
must
arrange
night
meals
to
suit
it
i
therefore
with
my
mind
still
full
of
the
forest
sat
down
and
lit
a
match
and
peered
into
my
sack
taking
out
therefrom
bread
and
ham
and
chocolate
and
brûlé
wine
for
seat
and
table
there
was
a
heathery
bank
still
full
of
the
warmth
and
savour
of
the
last
daylight
for
companions
these
great
inimical
influences
of
the
night
which
i
had
met
and
dreaded
and
for
occasion
or
excuse
there
was
hunger
of
the
many
that
debate
what
shall
be
done
with
travellers
it
was
the
best
and
kindest
spirit
that
prompted
me
to
this
salutary
act
for
as
i
drank
the
wine
and
dealt
with
the
ham
and
bread
i
felt
more
and
more
that
i
had
a
right
to
the
road
the
stars
became
familiar
and
the
woods
a
plaything
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
body
must
be
recognized
and
the
soul
kept
in
its
place
since
a
little
refreshing
food
and
drink
can
do
so
much
to
make
a
man
on
this
repast
i
jumped
up
merrily
lit
a
pipe
and
began
singing
and
heard
to
my
inexpressible
joy
some
way
down
the
road
the
sound
of
other
voices
they
were
singing
that
old
song
of
the
french
infantry
which
dates
from
louis
xiv
and
is
called
de
ma
blonde
i
answered
their
chorus
so
that
by
the
time
we
met
under
the
wood
we
were
already
acquainted
they
told
me
they
had
had
a
hours
leave
into
nancy
the
four
of
them
and
had
to
be
in
by
at
a
place
called
villey
the
dry
i
remembered
it
after
all
those
years
it
is
a
village
perched
on
the
brow
of
one
of
these
high
hills
above
the
river
and
it
found
itself
one
day
surrounded
by
earthworks
and
a
great
fort
raised
just
above
the
church
then
before
they
knew
where
they
were
they
learnt
that
no
one
could
go
in
or
out
between
sunset
and
sunrise
without
leave
of
the
officer
in
command
that
from
being
a
village
they
had
become
the
situate
within
fort
no
that
they
were
to
be
deluged
with
soldiers
and
that
they
were
liable
to
evacuate
their
tenements
on
mobilization
they
had
become
a
fort
unwittingly
as
they
slept
and
all
their
streets
were
blocked
with
ramparts
a
hard
fate
but
they
should
not
have
built
their
village
just
on
the
brow
of
a
round
hill
they
did
this
in
the
old
days
when
men
used
stone
instead
of
iron
because
the
top
of
a
hill
was
a
good
place
to
hold
against
enemies
and
so
now
these
years
after
they
find
the
same
advantage
catching
them
again
to
their
hurt
and
so
things
go
the
round
anyway
villey
the
dry
is
a
fort
and
there
my
four
brothers
were
going
it
was
miles
off
and
they
had
to
be
in
by
sunrise
so
i
offered
them
a
pull
of
my
wine
which
to
my
great
joy
they
refused
and
we
parted
courteously
then
i
found
the
road
beginning
to
fall
and
knew
that
i
had
crossed
the
hills
as
the
forest
ended
and
the
sloping
fields
began
a
dim
moon
came
up
late
in
the
east
in
the
bank
of
fog
that
masked
the
river
so
by
a
sloping
road
now
free
from
the
woods
and
at
the
mouth
of
a
fine
untenanted
valley
under
the
moon
i
came
down
again
to
the
moselle
having
saved
a
great
elbow
by
this
excursion
over
the
high
land
as
i
swung
round
the
bend
of
the
hills
downwards
and
looked
up
the
sloping
dell
i
remembered
that
these
heathery
hollows
were
called
by
the
people
of
lorraine
and
this
set
me
singing
the
song
of
the
hunters
tu
dans
nos
vallons
le
chasseur
sonner
du
clairon
which
i
sang
loudly
till
i
reached
the
river
bank
and
lost
the
exhilaration
of
the
hills
i
had
now
come
some
twelve
miles
from
my
and
it
was
midnight
the
plain
the
level
road
which
often
rose
a
little
and
the
dank
air
of
the
river
began
to
oppress
me
with
fatigue
i
was
not
disturbed
by
this
for
i
had
intended
to
break
these
nights
of
marching
by
occasional
repose
and
while
i
was
in
the
comfort
of
cities
especially
in
the
false
hopes
that
one
got
by
reading
books
i
had
imagined
that
it
was
a
light
matter
to
sleep
in
the
open
indeed
i
had
often
so
slept
when
i
had
been
compelled
to
it
in
manoeuvres
but
i
had
forgotten
how
essential
was
a
rug
of
some
kind
and
what
a
difference
a
fire
and
comradeship
could
make
thinking
over
it
all
feeling
my
tiredness
and
shivering
a
little
in
the
chill
under
the
moon
and
the
clear
sky
i
was
very
ready
to
capitulate
and
to
sleep
in
bed
like
a
christian
at
the
next
opportunity
but
there
is
some
influence
in
vows
or
plans
that
escapes
our
power
of
rejudgement
all
false
calculations
must
be
paid
for
and
i
found
as
you
will
see
that
having
said
i
would
sleep
in
the
open
i
had
to
keep
to
it
in
spite
of
all
my
second
thoughts
i
passed
one
village
and
then
another
in
which
everything
was
dark
and
in
which
i
could
waken
nothing
but
dogs
who
thought
me
an
enemy
till
at
last
i
saw
a
great
belt
of
light
in
the
fog
above
the
moselle
here
there
was
a
kind
of
town
or
large
settlement
where
there
were
ironworks
and
where
as
i
thought
there
would
be
houses
open
even
after
midnight
i
first
found
the
old
town
where
just
two
men
were
awake
at
some
cooking
work
or
other
i
found
them
by
a
chink
of
light
streaming
through
their
door
but
they
gave
me
no
hope
only
advising
me
to
go
across
the
river
and
try
in
the
new
town
where
the
forges
and
the
ironworks
were
they
said
should
certainly
find
a
bed
i
crossed
the
bridge
being
now
much
too
weary
to
notice
anything
even
the
shadowy
hills
and
the
first
thing
i
found
was
a
lot
of
waggons
that
belonged
to
a
caravan
or
fair
here
some
men
were
awake
but
when
i
suggested
that
they
should
let
me
sleep
in
their
little
houses
on
wheels
they
told
me
it
was
never
done
that
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
pack
in
themselves
that
they
had
no
straw
that
they
were
guarded
by
dogs
and
generally
gave
me
to
understand
though
without
violence
or
unpoliteness
that
i
looked
as
though
i
were
the
man
to
steal
their
lions
and
tigers
they
told
me
however
that
without
doubt
i
should
find
something
open
in
the
centre
of
the
quarter
where
the
great
electric
lamps
now
made
a
glare
over
the
factory
i
trudged
on
unwillingly
and
at
the
very
last
house
of
this
detestable
industrial
slavery
a
high
house
with
a
gable
i
saw
a
window
wide
open
and
a
blonde
man
smoking
a
cigarette
at
a
balcony
i
called
to
him
at
once
and
asked
him
to
let
me
a
bed
he
put
to
me
all
the
questions
he
could
think
of
why
was
i
there
where
had
i
come
from
where
if
i
was
honest
had
i
intended
to
sleep
how
came
i
at
such
an
hour
on
foot
and
other
examinations
i
thought
a
little
what
excuse
to
give
him
and
then
determining
that
i
was
too
tired
to
make
up
anything
plausible
i
told
him
the
full
truth
that
i
had
meant
to
sleep
rough
but
had
been
overcome
by
fatigue
and
that
i
had
walked
from
toul
starting
at
evening
i
conjured
him
by
our
common
faith
to
let
me
in
he
told
me
that
it
was
impossible
as
he
had
but
one
room
in
which
he
and
his
family
slept
and
assured
me
he
had
asked
all
these
questions
out
of
sympathy
and
charity
alone
then
he
wished
me
honestly
and
kindly
and
went
in
by
this
time
i
was
very
much
put
out
and
began
to
be
angry
these
straggling
french
towns
give
no
opportunity
for
a
shelter
i
saw
that
i
should
have
to
get
out
beyond
the
market
gardens
and
that
it
might
be
a
mile
or
two
before
i
found
any
rest
a
clock
struck
one
i
looked
up
and
saw
it
was
from
the
belfry
of
one
of
those
new
chapels
which
the
monks
are
building
everywhere
nor
did
i
forget
to
curse
the
monks
in
my
heart
for
building
them
i
cursed
also
those
who
started
smelting
works
in
the
moselle
valley
those
who
gave
false
advice
to
travellers
those
who
kept
lions
and
tigers
in
caravans
and
for
a
small
sum
i
would
have
cursed
the
whole
human
race
when
i
saw
that
my
bile
had
hurried
me
out
of
the
street
well
into
the
countryside
and
that
above
me
on
a
bank
was
a
patch
of
orchard
and
a
lane
leading
up
to
it
into
this
i
turned
and
finding
a
good
deal
of
dry
hay
lying
under
the
trees
i
soon
made
myself
an
excellent
bed
first
building
a
little
mattress
and
then
piling
on
hay
as
warm
as
a
blanket
i
did
not
lie
awake
as
when
i
planned
my
pilgrimage
i
had
promised
myself
i
would
do
looking
at
the
sky
through
the
branches
of
trees
but
i
slept
at
once
without
dreaming
and
woke
up
to
find
it
was
broad
daylight
and
the
sun
ready
to
rise
then
stiff
and
but
little
rested
by
two
hours
of
exhaustion
i
took
up
my
staff
and
my
sack
and
regained
the
road
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
those
who
have
an
answer
to
everything
can
say
about
the
food
requisite
to
breakfast
those
great
men
marlowe
and
jonson
shakespeare
and
spenser
before
him
drank
beer
at
rising
and
tamed
it
with
a
little
bread
in
the
regiment
we
used
to
drink
black
coffee
without
sugar
and
cut
off
a
great
hunk
of
stale
crust
and
eat
nothing
more
till
the
halt
for
the
matter
of
that
the
great
victories
of
were
fought
upon
such
unsubstantial
meals
for
the
republicans
fought
first
and
ate
afterwards
being
in
this
quite
unlike
the
ten
thousand
sailors
i
know
eat
nothing
for
some
hours
i
mean
those
who
turn
out
at
four
in
the
morning
i
could
give
the
name
of
the
watch
but
that
i
forget
it
and
will
not
be
plagued
to
look
up
technicalities
dogs
eat
the
first
thing
they
come
across
cats
take
a
little
milk
and
gentlemen
are
accustomed
to
get
up
at
nine
and
eat
eggs
bacon
kidneys
ham
cold
pheasant
toast
coffee
tea
scones
and
honey
after
which
they
will
boast
that
their
race
is
the
hardiest
in
the
world
and
ready
to
bear
every
fatigue
in
the
pursuit
of
empire
but
what
rule
governs
all
this
why
is
breakfast
different
from
all
other
things
so
that
the
greeks
called
it
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
so
that
each
of
us
in
a
vague
way
knows
that
he
would
eat
at
breakfast
nothing
but
one
special
kind
of
food
and
that
he
could
not
imagine
breakfast
at
any
other
hour
in
the
day
the
provocation
to
this
inquiry
which
i
have
here
no
time
to
pursue
lies
in
the
extraordinary
distaste
that
i
conceived
that
morning
for
brule
wine
my
ham
and
bread
and
chocolate
i
had
consumed
overnight
i
thought
in
my
folly
that
i
could
break
my
fast
on
a
swig
of
what
had
seemed
to
me
only
the
night
before
the
best
revivifier
and
sustenance
possible
in
the
harsh
dawn
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
but
a
bitter
and
intolerable
vinegar
i
make
no
attempt
to
explain
this
nor
to
say
why
the
very
same
wine
that
had
seemed
so
good
in
the
forest
and
was
to
seem
so
good
again
later
on
by
the
canal
should
now
repel
me
i
can
only
tell
you
that
this
heavy
disappointment
convinced
me
of
a
great
truth
that
a
politician
once
let
slip
in
my
hearing
and
that
i
have
never
since
forgotten
said
the
director
of
the
state
is
but
the
creature
of
circumstance
as
it
was
i
lit
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
hobbled
blindly
along
for
miles
under
and
towards
the
brightening
east
just
before
the
sun
rose
i
turned
and
looked
backward
from
a
high
bridge
that
recrossed
the
river
the
long
effort
of
the
night
had
taken
me
well
on
my
way
i
was
out
of
the
familiar
region
of
the
garrison
the
great
that
i
had
traversed
stood
up
opposite
the
dawn
catching
the
new
light
heavy
drifting
but
white
clouds
rare
at
such
an
hour
sailed
above
them
the
valley
of
the
moselle
which
i
had
never
thought
of
save
as
a
half
mountainous
region
had
fallen
to
become
a
kind
of
long
garden
whose
walls
were
regular
low
and
cultivated
slopes
the
main
waterway
of
the
valley
was
now
not
the
river
but
the
canal
that
fed
from
it
the
tall
grasses
the
leaves
and
poplars
bordering
the
river
and
the
canal
seemed
dark
close
to
me
but
the
valley
as
a
whole
was
vague
a
mass
of
trees
with
one
lorraine
showing
and
the
delicate
slopes
bounding
it
on
either
side
descending
from
this
bridge
i
found
a
that
told
me
i
had
walked
kilometres
which
is
twenty
miles
from
toul
that
it
was
one
kilometre
to
flavigny
and
heaven
knows
how
much
to
a
place
called
charmes
the
sun
rose
in
the
mist
that
lay
up
the
long
even
trends
of
the
vale
between
the
low
and
level
hills
and
i
pushed
on
my
thousand
yards
towards
flavigny
there
by
a
special
providence
i
found
the
entertainment
and
companionship
whose
lack
had
left
me
wrecked
all
these
early
hours
as
i
came
into
flavigny
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
a
place
on
which
a
book
might
easily
be
written
for
it
had
a
church
built
in
the
seventeenth
century
when
few
churches
were
built
outside
great
towns
a
convent
and
a
general
air
of
importance
that
made
of
it
that
grand
and
noble
thing
that
primary
cell
of
the
organism
of
europe
that
best
of
all
christian
associations
a
large
village
i
say
a
book
might
be
written
upon
it
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
great
many
articles
and
pamphlets
must
have
been
written
upon
it
for
the
french
are
furiously
given
to
local
research
and
reviews
and
to
glorifying
their
native
places
and
when
they
can
not
discover
folklore
they
enrich
their
beloved
homes
by
inventing
it
there
was
even
a
man
i
forget
his
name
who
wrote
a
delightful
book
called
and
traditional
songs
of
my
province
which
book
after
he
was
dead
was
discovered
to
be
entirely
his
own
invention
and
not
a
word
of
it
familiar
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
soil
he
was
a
large
laughing
man
that
smoked
enormously
had
great
masses
of
hair
and
worked
by
night
also
he
delighted
in
the
society
of
friends
and
talked
continuously
i
wish
he
had
a
statue
somewhere
and
that
they
would
pull
down
to
make
room
for
it
any
one
of
those
useless
bronzes
that
are
to
be
found
even
in
the
little
villages
and
that
commemorate
solemn
whiskered
men
pillars
of
the
state
for
surely
this
is
the
habit
of
the
true
poet
and
marks
the
vigour
and
recurrent
origin
of
poetry
that
a
man
should
get
his
head
full
of
rhythms
and
catches
and
that
they
should
jumble
up
somehow
into
short
songs
of
his
own
what
could
more
suggest
for
instance
a
whole
troop
of
dancing
words
and
lovely
thoughts
than
this
refrain
from
the
tourdenoise
son
beau
corps
est
en
terre
son
âme
en
paradis
tu
ris
et
ris
tu
ris
ma
bergère
ris
ma
bergère
tu
ris
that
was
the
way
they
set
to
work
in
england
before
the
puritans
came
when
men
were
not
afraid
to
steal
verses
from
one
another
and
when
no
one
imagined
that
he
could
live
by
letters
but
when
every
poet
took
a
patron
or
begged
or
robbed
the
churches
so
much
for
the
poets
flavigny
then
i
say
for
i
seem
to
be
digressing
is
a
long
street
of
houses
all
built
together
as
animals
build
their
communities
they
are
all
very
old
but
the
people
have
worked
hard
since
the
revolution
and
none
of
them
are
poor
nor
are
any
of
them
very
rich
i
saw
but
one
gentleman
house
and
that
i
am
glad
to
say
was
in
disrepair
most
of
the
peasants
houses
had
for
a
ground
floor
cavernous
great
barns
out
of
which
came
a
delightful
smell
of
morning
that
is
of
hay
litter
oxen
and
stored
grains
and
old
wood
which
is
the
true
breath
of
morning
because
it
is
the
scent
that
all
the
human
race
worth
calling
human
first
meets
when
it
rises
and
is
the
association
of
sunrise
in
the
minds
of
those
who
keep
the
world
alive
but
not
in
the
wretched
minds
of
townsmen
and
least
of
all
in
the
minds
of
journalists
who
know
nothing
of
morning
save
that
it
is
a
time
of
jaded
emptiness
when
you
have
just
done
prophesying
for
the
hundredth
time
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
when
the
floors
are
beginning
to
tremble
with
machinery
and
when
in
a
weary
kind
of
way
one
feels
hungry
and
alone
a
nasty
life
and
usually
a
short
one
to
return
to
flavigny
this
way
of
stretching
a
village
all
along
one
street
is
roman
and
is
the
mark
of
civilization
when
i
was
at
college
i
was
compelled
to
read
a
work
by
the
crabbed
tacitus
on
the
germans
where
in
the
midst
of
a
deal
that
is
vague
and
fantastic
nonsense
and
much
that
is
wilful
lying
comes
this
excellent
truth
that
barbarians
build
their
houses
separate
but
civilized
men
together
so
whenever
you
see
a
lot
of
red
roofs
nestling
as
the
phrase
goes
in
the
woods
of
a
hillside
in
south
england
remember
that
all
that
is
savagery
but
when
you
see
a
hundred
houses
in
a
row
along
a
dead
straight
road
lift
up
your
hearts
for
you
are
in
civilization
again
but
i
continue
to
wander
from
flavigny
the
first
thing
i
saw
as
i
came
into
the
street
and
noted
how
the
level
sun
stood
in
a
haze
beyond
and
how
it
shadowed
and
brought
out
the
slight
irregularities
of
the
road
was
a
cart
drawn
by
a
galloping
donkey
which
came
at
and
passed
me
with
a
prodigious
clatter
as
i
dragged
myself
forward
in
the
cart
were
two
nuns
each
with
a
scythe
they
were
going
out
mowing
and
were
up
the
first
in
the
village
as
religious
always
are
cheered
by
this
happy
omen
but
not
yet
heartened
i
next
met
a
very
old
man
leading
out
a
horse
and
asked
him
if
there
was
anywhere
where
i
could
find
coffee
and
bread
at
that
hour
but
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
wished
me
in
a
strong
accent
for
he
was
deaf
and
probably
thought
i
was
begging
so
i
went
on
still
more
despondent
till
i
came
to
a
really
merry
man
of
about
middle
age
who
was
going
to
the
fields
singing
with
a
very
large
rake
over
his
shoulder
when
i
had
asked
him
the
same
question
he
stared
at
me
a
little
and
said
of
course
coffee
and
bread
could
be
had
at
the
baker
and
when
i
asked
him
how
i
should
know
the
baker
he
was
still
more
surprised
at
my
ignorance
and
said
the
smoke
coming
from
the
large
chimney
this
i
saw
rising
a
short
way
off
on
my
right
so
i
thanked
him
and
went
and
found
there
a
youth
of
about
nineteen
who
sat
at
a
fine
oak
table
and
had
coffee
rum
and
a
loaf
before
him
he
was
waiting
for
the
bread
in
the
oven
to
be
ready
and
meanwhile
he
was
very
courteous
poured
out
coffee
and
rum
for
me
and
offered
me
bread
it
is
a
matter
often
discussed
why
bakers
are
such
excellent
citizens
and
good
men
for
while
it
is
admitted
in
every
country
i
was
ever
in
that
cobblers
are
argumentative
and
atheists
i
except
the
cobbler
under
plinlimmon
concerning
whom
would
to
heaven
i
had
the
space
to
tell
you
all
here
for
he
knows
the
legends
of
the
mountain
while
it
is
public
that
barbers
are
garrulous
and
servile
that
millers
are
cheats
we
say
in
sussex
that
every
honest
miller
has
a
large
tuft
of
hair
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
yet
with
every
trade
in
the
world
having
some
bad
quality
attached
to
it
bakers
alone
are
exempt
and
every
one
takes
it
for
granted
that
they
are
sterling
indeed
there
are
some
societies
in
which
no
matter
how
gloomy
and
churlish
the
conversation
may
have
become
you
have
but
to
mention
bakers
for
voices
to
brighten
suddenly
and
for
a
good
influence
to
pervade
every
one
i
say
this
is
known
for
a
fact
but
not
usually
explained
the
explanation
is
that
bakers
are
always
up
early
in
the
morning
and
can
watch
the
dawn
and
that
in
this
occupation
they
live
in
lonely
contemplation
enjoying
the
early
hours
so
it
was
with
this
baker
of
mine
in
flavigny
who
was
a
boy
when
he
heard
that
i
had
served
at
toul
he
was
delighted
beyond
measure
he
told
me
of
a
brother
of
his
that
had
been
in
the
same
regiment
and
he
assured
me
that
he
was
himself
going
into
the
artillery
by
special
enlistment
having
got
his
father
leave
you
know
very
little
if
you
think
i
missed
the
opportunity
of
making
the
guns
seem
terrible
and
glorious
in
his
eyes
i
told
him
stories
enough
to
waken
a
sentry
of
reserve
and
if
it
had
been
possible
with
my
youth
so
obvious
i
would
have
woven
in
a
few
anecdotes
of
active
service
and
described
great
shells
bursting
under
my
horses
and
the
teams
shot
down
and
the
gunners
all
the
while
impassive
but
as
i
saw
i
should
not
be
believed
i
did
not
speak
of
such
things
but
confined
myself
to
what
he
would
see
and
hear
when
he
joined
meanwhile
the
good
warm
food
and
the
rising
morning
had
done
two
things
they
had
put
much
more
vigour
into
me
than
i
had
had
when
i
slunk
in
before
but
at
the
same
time
and
this
is
a
thing
that
often
comes
with
food
and
with
rest
they
had
made
me
feel
the
fatigue
of
so
long
a
night
i
rose
up
therefore
determined
to
find
some
place
where
i
could
sleep
i
asked
this
friend
of
mine
how
much
there
was
to
pay
and
he
said
then
we
exchanged
ritual
salutations
and
i
took
the
road
i
did
not
leave
the
town
or
village
without
noticing
one
extraordinary
thing
at
the
far
end
of
it
which
was
that
whereas
most
places
in
france
are
proud
of
their
and
make
a
great
show
of
it
here
in
flavigny
they
had
taken
a
great
house
and
written
over
it
école
communale
in
great
letters
and
then
they
had
written
over
a
kind
of
or
of
this
big
place
the
words
de
ville
in
very
small
letters
so
small
that
i
had
a
doubt
for
a
moment
if
the
citizens
here
were
good
republicans
a
treasonable
thought
on
all
this
frontier
then
a
mile
onward
i
saw
the
road
cross
the
canal
and
run
parallel
to
it
i
saw
the
canal
run
another
mile
or
so
under
a
fine
bank
of
deep
woods
i
saw
an
old
bridge
leading
over
it
to
that
inviting
shade
and
as
it
was
now
nearly
six
and
the
sun
was
gathering
strength
i
went
with
slumber
overpowering
me
and
my
feet
turning
heavy
beneath
me
along
the
over
the
bridge
and
lay
down
on
the
moss
under
these
delightful
trees
forgetful
of
the
penalty
that
such
an
early
repose
would
bring
and
of
the
great
heat
that
was
to
follow
at
midday
i
quickly
became
part
of
the
life
of
that
forest
and
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
full
eight
and
the
sun
had
gained
great
power
i
saw
him
shining
at
me
through
the
branches
of
my
trees
like
a
patient
enemy
outside
a
city
that
one
watches
through
the
loopholes
of
a
tower
and
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
taking
the
road
i
looked
below
me
down
the
steep
bank
between
the
trunks
and
saw
the
canal
looking
like
black
marble
and
i
heard
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
above
it
and
i
noted
that
all
the
mist
had
gone
a
very
long
way
off
the
noise
of
its
ripples
coming
clearly
along
the
floor
of
the
water
was
a
lazy
barge
and
a
horse
drawing
it
from
time
to
time
the
slackened
into
the
still
surface
and
i
heard
it
dripping
as
it
rose
the
rest
of
the
valley
was
silent
except
for
that
of
insects
which
marks
the
strength
of
the
sun
now
i
saw
clearly
how
difficult
it
was
to
turn
night
into
day
for
i
found
myself
condemned
either
to
waste
many
hours
that
ought
to
be
consumed
on
my
pilgrimage
or
else
to
march
on
under
the
extreme
heat
and
when
i
had
drunk
what
was
left
of
my
brule
wine
which
then
seemed
delicious
and
had
eaten
a
piece
of
bread
i
stiffly
jolted
down
the
bank
and
regained
the
highway
in
the
first
village
i
came
to
i
found
that
mass
was
over
and
this
justly
annoyed
me
for
what
is
a
pilgrimage
in
which
a
man
can
not
hear
mass
every
morning
of
all
the
things
i
have
read
about
st
louis
which
make
me
wish
i
had
known
him
to
speak
to
nothing
seems
to
me
more
delightful
than
his
habit
of
getting
mass
daily
whenever
he
marched
down
south
but
why
this
should
be
so
delightful
i
can
not
tell
of
course
there
is
a
grace
and
influence
belonging
to
such
a
custom
but
it
is
not
of
that
i
am
speaking
but
of
the
pleasing
sensation
of
order
and
accomplishment
which
attaches
to
a
day
one
has
opened
by
mass
a
purely
temporal
and
for
all
i
know
what
the
monks
back
at
the
ironworks
would
have
called
a
carnal
feeling
but
a
source
of
continual
comfort
to
me
let
them
go
their
way
and
let
me
go
mine
this
comfort
i
ascribe
to
four
causes
just
above
you
will
find
it
written
that
i
could
not
tell
why
this
should
be
so
but
what
of
that
and
these
causes
are
that
for
just
at
the
opening
of
the
day
you
are
silent
and
recollected
and
have
to
put
off
cares
interests
and
passions
in
the
repetition
of
a
familiar
action
this
must
certainly
be
a
great
benefit
to
the
body
and
give
it
tone
that
the
mass
is
a
careful
and
rapid
ritual
now
it
is
the
function
of
all
ritual
as
we
see
in
games
social
arrangements
and
so
forth
to
relieve
the
mind
by
so
much
of
responsibility
and
initiative
and
to
catch
you
up
as
it
were
into
itself
leading
your
life
for
you
during
the
time
it
lasts
in
this
way
you
experience
a
singular
repose
after
which
fallowness
i
am
sure
one
is
fitter
for
action
and
judgement
that
the
surroundings
incline
you
to
good
and
reasonable
thoughts
and
for
the
moment
deaden
the
rasp
and
jar
of
that
busy
wickedness
which
both
working
in
one
self
and
received
from
others
is
the
true
source
of
all
human
miseries
thus
the
time
spent
at
mass
is
like
a
short
repose
in
a
deep
and
library
into
which
no
sounds
come
and
where
you
feel
yourself
secure
against
the
outer
world
and
the
most
important
cause
of
this
feeling
of
satisfaction
is
that
you
are
doing
what
the
human
race
has
done
for
thousands
upon
thousands
upon
thousands
of
years
this
is
a
matter
of
such
moment
that
i
am
astonished
people
hear
of
it
so
little
whatever
is
buried
right
into
our
blood
from
immemorial
habit
that
we
must
be
certain
to
do
if
we
are
to
be
fairly
happy
of
course
no
grown
man
or
woman
can
really
be
very
happy
for
long
but
i
mean
reasonably
happy
and
what
is
more
important
decent
and
secure
of
our
souls
thus
one
should
from
time
to
time
hunt
animals
or
at
the
very
least
shoot
at
a
mark
one
should
always
drink
some
kind
of
fermented
liquor
with
food
and
especially
deeply
upon
great
one
should
go
on
the
water
from
time
to
time
and
one
should
dance
on
occasions
and
one
should
sing
in
chorus
for
all
these
things
man
has
done
since
god
put
him
into
a
garden
and
his
eyes
first
became
troubled
with
a
soul
similarly
some
teacher
or
ranter
or
other
whose
name
i
forget
said
lately
one
very
wise
thing
at
least
which
was
that
every
man
should
do
a
little
work
with
his
hands
oh
what
good
philosophy
this
is
and
how
much
better
it
would
be
if
rich
people
instead
of
raining
the
influence
of
their
rank
and
spending
their
money
on
leagues
for
this
or
that
exceptional
thing
were
to
spend
it
in
converting
the
to
ordinary
living
and
to
the
tradition
of
the
race
indeed
if
i
had
power
for
some
thirty
years
i
would
see
to
it
that
people
should
be
allowed
to
follow
their
inbred
instincts
in
these
matters
and
should
hunt
drink
sing
dance
sail
and
dig
and
those
that
would
not
should
be
compelled
by
force
now
in
the
morning
mass
you
do
all
that
the
race
needs
to
do
and
has
done
for
all
these
ages
where
religion
was
concerned
there
you
have
the
sacred
and
separate
enclosure
the
altar
the
priest
in
his
vestments
the
set
ritual
the
ancient
and
hierarchic
tongue
and
all
that
your
nature
cries
out
for
in
the
matter
of
worship
from
these
considerations
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
put
out
i
was
to
find
mass
over
on
this
first
morning
of
my
pilgrimage
and
i
went
along
the
burning
road
in
a
very
till
i
saw
upon
my
right
beyond
a
low
wall
and
in
a
kind
of
park
a
house
that
seemed
built
on
some
artificial
raised
ground
surrounded
by
a
wall
but
this
may
have
been
an
illusion
the
house
being
really
only
very
tall
at
any
rate
i
drew
it
and
in
the
village
just
beyond
it
i
learnt
something
curious
about
the
man
that
owned
it
for
i
had
gone
into
a
house
to
take
a
third
meal
of
bread
and
wine
and
to
replenish
my
bottle
when
the
old
woman
of
the
house
who
was
a
kindly
person
told
me
she
had
just
then
no
wine
said
she
so
and
so
that
lives
in
the
big
house
sells
it
to
any
one
who
cares
to
buy
even
in
the
smallest
quantities
and
you
will
see
his
shed
standing
by
the
side
of
the
road
everything
happened
just
as
she
had
said
i
came
to
the
big
shed
by
the
park
wall
and
there
was
a
kind
of
counter
made
of
boards
and
several
big
tuns
and
two
men
one
in
an
apron
serving
and
the
other
in
a
little
box
or
compartment
writing
i
was
somewhat
timid
to
ask
for
so
little
as
a
quart
but
the
apron
man
in
the
most
businesslike
way
filled
my
bottle
at
a
tap
and
asked
for
fourpence
he
was
willing
to
talk
and
told
me
many
things
of
good
years
in
wine
of
the
nature
of
their
trade
of
the
influence
of
the
moon
on
brewing
of
the
importance
of
spigots
and
what
not
but
when
i
tried
to
get
out
of
him
whether
the
owner
were
an
eccentric
private
gentleman
or
a
merchant
that
had
the
sense
to
earn
little
pennies
as
well
as
large
ones
i
could
not
make
him
understand
my
meaning
for
his
idea
of
rank
was
utterly
different
from
mine
and
took
no
account
of
idleness
and
luxury
and
daftness
but
was
based
entirely
upon
money
and
clothes
moreover
we
were
both
of
us
republicans
so
the
matter
was
of
no
great
moment
courteously
saluting
ourselves
we
parted
he
remaining
to
sell
wine
and
i
hobbling
to
rome
now
a
little
painfully
and
my
sack
the
heavier
by
a
quart
of
wine
which
as
you
probably
know
weighs
almost
exactly
two
pounds
and
a
half
it
was
by
this
time
close
upon
eleven
and
i
had
long
reached
the
stage
when
some
kinds
of
men
begin
talking
of
dogged
determination
pluck
the
stubborn
spirit
of
the
island
race
and
so
forth
but
when
those
who
can
boast
a
little
of
the
sacred
french
blood
are
in
a
mood
of
set
despair
both
kinds
march
on
and
the
mobility
of
either
infantry
is
much
the
same
i
say
i
had
long
got
to
this
point
of
exhaustion
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
need
an
excellent
and
thorough
meal
at
midday
but
on
looking
at
my
map
i
found
that
there
was
nothing
nearer
than
this
town
of
charmes
that
was
marked
on
the
milestones
and
that
was
the
first
place
i
should
come
to
in
the
department
of
the
vosges
it
would
take
much
too
long
to
describe
the
dodges
that
weary
men
and
stiff
have
recourse
to
when
they
are
at
the
close
of
a
difficult
task
how
they
divide
it
up
in
lengths
in
their
minds
how
they
count
numbers
how
they
begin
to
solve
problems
in
mental
arithmetic
i
tried
them
all
then
i
thought
of
a
new
one
which
is
really
excellent
and
which
i
recommend
to
the
whole
world
it
is
to
vary
the
road
suddenly
taking
now
the
fields
now
the
river
but
only
occasionally
the
turnpike
this
last
lap
was
very
well
suited
for
such
a
method
the
valley
had
become
more
like
a
wide
and
shallow
trench
than
ever
the
hills
on
either
side
were
low
and
exactly
even
up
the
middle
of
it
went
the
river
the
canal
and
the
road
and
these
two
last
had
only
a
field
between
them
now
broad
now
narrow
first
on
the
then
on
the
road
then
on
the
grass
then
back
on
the
i
pieced
out
the
last
baking
mile
into
charmes
that
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
rather
higher
hill
and
at
last
was
dragging
myself
up
the
street
just
as
the
bell
was
ringing
the
noon
angelus
nor
however
tedious
you
may
have
found
it
to
read
this
final
effort
of
mine
can
you
have
found
it
a
quarter
as
wearisome
as
i
did
to
walk
it
and
surely
between
writer
and
reader
there
should
be
give
and
take
now
the
one
furnishing
the
entertainment
and
now
the
other
the
delightful
thing
in
charmes
is
its
name
of
this
name
i
had
indeed
been
thinking
as
i
went
along
the
last
miles
of
that
dusty
and
deplorable
road
that
a
town
should
be
called
not
but
that
towns
if
they
are
left
to
themselves
and
not
hurried
have
a
way
of
settling
into
right
names
suited
to
the
hills
about
them
and
recalling
their
own
fields
i
remember
sussex
and
as
i
remember
it
i
must
if
only
for
example
set
down
my
of
such
names
as
fittleworth
where
the
inn
has
painted
panels
amberley
in
the
marshes
delicate
fernhurst
and
ditchling
under
its
hill
arundel
that
is
well
known
to
every
one
and
climping
that
no
one
knows
set
on
a
lonely
beach
and
lost
at
the
vague
end
of
an
impassable
road
and
barlton
and
burton
and
duncton
and
coldwatham
that
stand
under
in
the
shadow
and
look
up
at
the
great
downs
and
petworth
where
the
spire
leans
sideways
and
timberley
that
the
floods
make
into
an
island
and
no
man
land
where
first
there
breaks
on
you
the
distant
sea
i
never
knew
a
sussex
man
yet
but
if
you
noted
him
such
a
list
would
answer
i
was
on
such
and
such
a
day
this
i
came
to
after
such
and
such
a
run
and
that
other
is
my
home
but
it
is
not
his
recollection
alone
which
moves
him
it
is
sound
of
the
names
he
feels
the
accent
of
them
and
all
the
men
who
live
between
and
the
channel
know
these
names
stand
for
eden
the
noise
is
enough
to
prove
it
so
it
is
also
with
the
hidden
valleys
of
the
lie
de
france
and
when
you
say
jouy
or
chevreuse
to
a
man
that
was
born
in
those
shadows
he
grows
dreamy
yet
they
are
within
a
walk
of
paris
but
the
wonderful
thing
about
a
name
like
charmes
is
that
it
hands
down
the
dead
for
some
dead
man
gave
it
a
keen
name
proceeding
from
his
own
immediate
delight
and
made
general
what
had
been
a
private
pleasure
and
so
to
speak
bequeathed
a
poem
to
his
town
they
say
the
arabs
do
this
calling
one
place
rest
of
the
warriors
and
another
end
and
another
surprise
of
the
horses
let
those
who
know
them
speak
for
it
i
at
least
know
that
in
the
west
of
the
cotentin
a
old
danes
married
to
gaulish
women
discovered
the
just
epithet
and
that
you
have
mary
on
the
hill
and
town
under
the
wind
and
borough
over
the
heath
which
are
exactly
what
their
name
describes
them
if
you
doubt
that
england
has
such
descriptive
names
consider
the
great
truth
that
at
one
junction
on
a
railway
where
a
mournful
desolation
of
stagnant
waters
and
treeless
stonewalled
fields
threatens
you
with
experience
and
awe
a
melancholy
porter
is
told
off
to
put
his
head
into
your
carriage
and
to
chant
like
charon
here
for
ashton
under
the
wood
moreton
on
the
marsh
bourton
on
the
water
and
stow
in
the
wold
charmes
does
not
fulfil
its
name
nor
preserve
what
its
forgotten
son
found
so
wonderful
in
it
for
at
luncheon
there
a
great
commercial
traveller
told
me
fiercely
that
it
was
chiefly
known
for
its
breweries
and
that
he
thought
it
of
little
account
still
even
in
charmes
i
found
one
marvellous
corner
of
a
renaissance
house
which
i
drew
but
as
i
have
lost
the
drawing
let
it
go
when
i
came
out
from
the
inn
of
charmes
the
heat
was
more
terrible
than
ever
and
the
prospect
of
a
march
in
it
more
intolerable
my
head
hung
i
went
very
slowly
and
i
played
with
cowardly
thoughts
which
were
really
had
i
known
it
good
angels
i
began
to
look
out
anxiously
for
woods
but
saw
only
long
whitened
wall
glaring
in
the
sun
or
if
ever
there
were
trees
they
were
surrounded
by
wooden
palisades
which
the
owners
had
put
there
but
in
a
little
time
now
i
had
definitely
yielded
to
temptation
i
found
a
thicket
you
must
know
that
if
you
yield
to
entertaining
a
temptation
there
is
the
opportunity
presented
to
you
like
lightning
a
theologian
told
me
this
and
it
is
partly
true
but
not
of
mammon
or
belphegor
or
whatever
devil
it
is
that
overlooks
the
currency
i
can
see
his
face
from
here
for
how
many
have
yielded
to
the
desire
of
riches
and
professed
themselves
very
willing
to
revel
in
them
yet
did
not
get
an
opportunity
worth
a
farthing
till
they
died
like
those
two
beggars
that
rabelais
tells
of
one
of
whom
wished
for
all
the
gold
that
would
pay
for
all
the
merchandise
that
had
ever
been
sold
in
paris
since
its
first
foundation
and
the
other
for
as
much
gold
as
would
go
into
all
the
sacks
that
could
be
sewn
by
all
the
needles
and
those
of
the
smallest
size
that
could
be
crammed
into
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
filling
the
smallest
crannies
yet
neither
had
a
crust
that
night
to
rub
his
gums
with
whatever
devil
it
is
however
that
tempts
men
to
repose
and
for
my
part
i
believe
him
to
be
rather
an
aeon
than
a
devil
that
is
a
fellow
working
on
his
own
account
neither
good
nor
ill
whatever
being
it
is
it
certainly
suits
one
mood
for
i
never
yet
knew
a
man
determined
to
be
lazy
that
had
not
ample
opportunity
afforded
him
though
he
were
poorer
than
the
cure
of
maigre
who
formed
a
syndicate
to
sell
at
a
scutcheon
a
gross
such
souls
as
were
too
insignificant
to
sell
singly
a
man
can
always
find
a
chance
for
doing
nothing
as
amply
and
with
as
ecstatic
a
satisfaction
as
the
world
allows
and
so
to
me
whether
it
was
there
before
i
can
not
tell
and
if
it
came
miraculously
so
much
the
more
amusing
appeared
this
thicket
it
was
to
the
left
of
the
road
a
stream
ran
through
it
in
a
little
ravine
the
undergrowth
was
thick
beneath
its
birches
and
just
beyond
on
the
plain
that
bordered
it
were
reapers
reaping
in
a
field
i
went
into
it
contentedly
and
slept
till
evening
my
third
sleep
then
refreshed
by
the
cool
wind
that
went
before
the
twilight
i
rose
and
took
the
road
again
but
i
knew
i
could
not
go
far
i
was
now
past
my
fortieth
mile
and
though
the
heat
had
gone
yet
my
dead
slumber
had
raised
a
thousand
evils
i
had
stiffened
to
lameness
and
had
fallen
into
the
mood
when
a
man
desires
companionship
and
the
talk
of
travellers
rather
than
the
open
plain
but
unless
i
went
backward
which
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
nowhere
to
rest
in
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
next
considerable
village
was
thayon
which
is
called
of
the
vosges
because
one
is
nearing
the
big
hills
and
thither
therefore
i
crawled
mile
after
mile
but
my
heart
sank
first
my
foot
limped
and
then
my
left
knee
oppressed
me
with
a
sudden
pain
i
attempted
to
relieve
it
by
leaning
on
my
right
leg
and
so
discovered
a
singular
new
law
in
medicine
which
i
will
propose
to
the
scientists
for
when
those
excellent
men
have
done
investigating
the
twirligigs
of
the
brain
to
find
out
where
the
soul
is
let
them
consider
this
much
more
practical
matter
that
you
can
not
relieve
the
pain
in
one
limb
without
driving
it
into
some
other
and
so
i
exchanged
twinges
in
the
left
knee
for
a
horrible
great
pain
in
the
right
i
sat
down
on
a
bridge
and
wondered
i
saw
before
me
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
miles
painful
and
exhausted
and
i
asked
heaven
if
this
was
necessary
to
a
pilgrimage
but
as
you
shall
hear
a
pilgrimage
is
not
wholly
subject
to
material
laws
for
when
i
came
to
épinal
next
day
i
went
into
a
shop
which
whatever
it
was
to
the
profane
appeared
to
me
as
a
chemist
shop
where
i
bought
a
bottle
of
some
stuff
called
and
rubbing
myself
with
it
was
instantly
cured
then
i
looked
down
from
the
bridge
across
the
plain
and
saw
a
long
way
off
beyond
the
railway
the
very
ugly
factory
village
of
thayon
and
reached
it
at
last
not
without
noticing
that
the
people
were
standing
branches
of
trees
before
their
doors
and
the
little
children
noisily
helping
to
tread
the
stems
firmly
into
the
earth
they
told
me
it
was
for
the
coming
of
corpus
christi
and
so
proved
to
me
that
religion
which
is
as
old
as
these
valleys
would
last
out
their
inhabiting
men
even
here
in
a
place
made
by
a
great
laundry
a
modern
industrial
row
of
tenements
all
the
world
was
putting
out
green
branches
to
welcome
the
procession
and
the
sacrament
and
the
priest
comforted
by
this
evident
refutation
of
the
sad
nonsense
i
had
read
in
cities
from
the
pen
of
intellectuals
nonsense
i
had
known
to
be
nonsense
but
that
had
none
the
less
tarnished
my
mind
i
happily
entered
the
inn
ate
and
drank
praised
god
and
lay
down
to
sleep
in
a
great
bed
i
mingled
with
my
prayers
a
firm
intention
of
doing
the
ordinary
things
and
not
attempting
impossibilities
such
as
marching
by
night
nor
following
out
any
other
vanities
of
this
world
then
having
cast
away
all
theories
of
how
a
pilgrimage
should
be
conducted
and
broken
five
or
six
vows
i
slept
steadily
till
the
middle
of
the
morning
i
had
covered
fifty
miles
in
hours
and
if
you
imagine
this
to
be
but
two
miles
an
hour
you
must
have
a
very
mathematical
mind
and
know
little
of
the
realities
of
living
i
woke
and
threw
my
shutters
open
to
the
bright
morning
and
the
masterful
sun
took
my
coffee
and
set
out
once
more
towards
epinal
the
stronghold
a
few
miles
away
delighted
to
see
that
my
shadow
was
so
short
and
the
road
so
hot
to
the
feet
and
eyes
for
i
said
at
least
proves
that
i
am
doing
like
all
the
world
and
walking
during
the
day
it
was
but
a
couple
of
hours
to
the
great
garrison
in
a
little
time
i
passed
a
battery
then
a
captain
went
by
on
a
horse
with
his
orderly
behind
him
where
the
deep
lock
stands
by
the
roadside
the
only
suggestion
of
coolness
i
first
heard
the
bugles
then
i
came
into
the
long
street
and
determined
to
explore
epinal
and
to
cast
aside
all
haste
and
folly
there
are
many
wonderful
things
in
epinal
as
for
instance
that
it
was
evidently
once
like
paris
and
melun
and
a
dozen
other
strongholds
of
the
gauls
an
island
city
for
the
rivers
of
france
are
full
of
long
habitable
islands
and
these
were
once
the
of
clans
then
there
are
the
forts
which
are
placed
on
high
hills
round
the
town
and
make
it
even
stronger
than
toul
for
epinal
stands
just
where
the
hills
begin
to
be
very
high
again
it
is
the
capital
of
a
mountain
district
and
this
character
always
does
something
peculiar
and
impressive
to
a
town
you
may
watch
its
effect
in
grenoble
in
little
aubusson
and
rather
less
in
geneva
for
in
such
towns
three
quite
different
kinds
of
men
meet
first
there
are
the
old
who
despise
the
highlanders
and
think
themselves
much
grander
and
more
civilized
these
are
the
burgesses
then
there
are
the
peasants
and
who
come
in
from
the
to
market
and
who
are
suspicious
of
the
and
yet
proud
to
depend
upon
a
real
town
with
a
bishop
and
paved
streets
lastly
there
are
the
travellers
who
come
there
to
enjoy
the
mountains
and
to
make
the
city
a
base
for
their
excursions
and
these
love
the
and
think
they
understand
them
and
they
despise
the
for
being
so
as
to
lord
it
over
the
but
in
truth
this
third
class
being
outsiders
are
equally
hated
and
despised
by
both
the
others
and
there
is
a
combination
against
them
and
they
are
exploited
and
there
are
many
other
things
in
which
épinal
is
wonderful
but
in
nothing
is
it
more
wonderful
than
in
its
great
church
i
suppose
that
the
high
dukes
of
burgundy
and
lorraine
and
the
rich
men
from
flanders
and
the
house
of
luxemburg
and
the
rest
going
to
rome
the
centre
of
the
world
had
often
to
pass
up
this
valley
of
the
moselle
which
as
i
have
said
is
a
road
leading
to
rome
and
would
halt
at
fipinal
and
would
at
times
give
money
for
its
church
with
this
result
that
the
church
belongs
to
every
imaginable
period
and
is
built
anyhow
in
twenty
styles
but
stands
as
a
whole
a
most
enduring
record
of
past
forms
and
of
what
has
pleased
the
changing
mind
when
it
has
attempted
to
worship
in
stone
thus
the
transept
is
simply
an
old
square
barn
of
rough
stone
older
i
suppose
than
charlemagne
and
without
any
ornament
in
its
lower
courses
i
thought
i
even
saw
the
roman
brick
it
had
once
two
towers
northern
and
southern
the
southern
is
ruined
and
has
a
wooden
roof
the
northern
remains
and
is
just
a
pinnacle
or
minaret
too
narrow
for
bells
then
the
apse
is
pure
and
beautiful
gothic
of
the
fourteenth
century
with
very
tall
and
fluted
windows
like
single
prayers
the
ambulatory
is
perfectly
modern
gothic
also
and
in
the
manner
that
viollet
le
duc
in
france
and
pugin
in
england
have
introduced
to
bring
us
back
to
our
origins
and
to
remind
us
of
the
place
whence
all
we
europeans
came
again
this
apse
and
ambulatory
are
not
perpendicular
to
the
transept
but
set
askew
a
thing
known
in
small
churches
and
said
to
be
a
symbol
but
surely
very
rare
in
large
ones
the
western
door
is
purely
romanesque
and
has
byzantine
ornaments
and
a
great
deep
round
door
to
match
it
there
is
a
northern
door
still
deeper
with
rows
and
rows
of
inner
arches
full
of
saints
angels
devils
and
flowers
and
this
again
is
not
straight
but
so
built
that
the
arches
go
aslant
as
you
sometimes
see
railway
bridges
when
they
cross
roads
at
an
angle
finally
there
is
a
central
tower
which
is
neither
gothic
nor
romanesque
but
pure
italian
a
loggia
with
splendid
round
airy
windows
taking
up
all
its
walls
and
with
a
flat
roof
and
eaves
this
some
one
straight
from
the
south
must
have
put
on
as
a
memory
of
his
wanderings
the
is
crumbling
old
grey
stone
the
romanesque
porches
are
red
like
strasburg
the
gothic
apse
is
old
white
as
our
cathedrals
are
the
modern
ambulatory
is
of
pure
white
stone
just
quarried
and
thus
colours
as
well
as
shapes
are
mingled
up
and
different
in
this
astonishing
building
i
drew
it
from
that
point
of
view
in
the
to
the
which
shows
most
of
these
contrasts
at
once
and
you
must
excuse
the
extreme
shakiness
of
the
sketch
for
it
was
taken
as
best
i
could
on
an
with
my
book
resting
on
the
apples
there
was
no
other
desk
nor
did
the
mind
my
doing
it
but
on
the
contrary
gave
me
advice
and
praise
saying
such
things
as
you
have
caught
the
angle
of
the
apse
come
now
darken
the
edge
of
that
pillar
i
fear
you
have
made
the
tower
a
little
confused
and
so
forth
i
offered
to
buy
a
few
apples
off
him
but
he
gave
me
three
instead
and
these
as
they
incommoded
me
i
gave
later
to
a
little
child
indeed
the
people
of
épinal
not
taking
me
for
a
traveller
but
simply
for
a
wandering
poor
man
were
very
genial
to
me
and
the
best
good
they
did
me
was
curing
my
lameness
for
seeing
an
apothecary
shop
as
i
was
leaving
the
town
i
went
in
and
said
to
the
apothecary
knee
has
swelled
and
is
very
painful
and
i
have
to
walk
far
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
how
to
cure
it
or
give
me
something
that
will
is
nothing
easier
he
said
have
here
a
specific
for
the
very
thing
you
complain
of
with
this
he
pulled
out
a
round
bottle
on
the
label
of
which
was
printed
in
great
letters
have
but
to
rub
your
knee
strongly
and
long
with
this
ointment
of
mine
he
said
you
will
be
cured
nor
did
he
mention
any
special
form
of
words
to
be
repeated
as
one
did
it
everything
happened
just
as
he
had
said
when
i
was
some
little
way
above
the
town
i
sat
down
on
a
low
wall
and
rubbed
my
knee
strongly
and
long
with
this
balm
and
the
pain
instantly
disappeared
then
with
a
heart
renewed
by
this
prodigy
i
took
the
road
again
and
began
walking
very
rapidly
and
high
swinging
on
to
rome
the
moselle
above
fipinal
takes
a
bend
outwards
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
much
shorter
way
to
the
next
village
which
is
called
archettes
or
very
little
arches
because
there
are
no
arches
there
would
be
right
over
the
hill
round
which
the
river
curved
this
error
came
from
following
private
judgement
and
not
heeding
tradition
here
represented
by
the
highroad
which
closely
follows
the
river
for
though
a
straight
tunnel
to
archettes
would
have
saved
distance
yet
a
climb
over
that
high
hill
and
through
the
pathless
wood
on
its
summit
was
folly
i
went
at
first
over
wide
sloping
fields
and
some
hundred
feet
above
the
valley
i
crossed
a
little
canal
it
was
made
on
a
very
good
system
and
i
recommend
it
to
the
riparian
owners
of
the
upper
wye
which
needs
it
they
take
the
water
from
the
moselle
which
is
here
broad
and
torrential
and
falls
in
steps
running
over
a
stony
bed
with
little
swirls
and
rapids
and
they
lead
it
along
at
an
even
gradient
averaging
as
it
were
the
uneven
descent
of
the
river
in
this
way
they
have
a
continuous
stream
running
through
fields
that
would
otherwise
be
bare
and
dry
but
that
are
thus
nourished
into
excellent
pastures
above
these
fields
the
forest
went
up
steeply
i
had
not
pushed
two
hundred
yards
into
its
gloom
and
confusion
when
i
discovered
that
i
had
lost
my
way
it
was
necessary
to
take
the
only
guide
i
had
and
to
go
straight
upwards
wherever
the
line
of
greatest
inclination
seemed
to
lie
for
that
at
least
would
take
me
to
a
summit
and
probably
to
a
view
of
the
valley
whereas
if
i
tried
to
make
for
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
which
had
been
my
first
intention
i
might
have
wandered
about
till
nightfall
it
was
an
old
man
in
a
valley
called
the
curicante
in
colorado
that
taught
me
this
if
one
lost
one
way
going
to
make
at
once
along
the
steepest
line
but
if
one
lost
it
going
to
listen
for
water
and
reach
it
and
follow
it
i
wish
i
had
space
to
tell
all
about
this
old
man
who
gave
me
hospitality
out
there
he
was
from
new
england
and
was
lonely
and
had
brought
out
at
great
expense
a
musical
box
to
cheer
him
of
this
he
was
very
proud
and
though
it
only
played
four
silly
hymn
tunes
yet
as
he
and
i
listened
to
it
heavy
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
light
tears
into
mine
because
these
tunes
reminded
him
of
his
home
but
i
have
no
time
to
do
more
than
mention
him
and
must
return
to
my
forest
i
climbed
then
over
slippery
pine
needles
and
under
the
charged
air
of
those
trees
which
was
full
of
dim
slanting
light
from
the
afternoon
sun
till
nearly
at
the
summit
i
came
upon
a
clearing
which
i
at
once
recognized
as
a
military
road
leading
to
what
we
used
to
call
a
battery
that
is
a
with
embrasures
into
which
guns
could
be
placed
but
in
which
no
guns
were
for
ever
since
the
french
managed
to
produce
a
really
mobile
heavy
gun
they
have
constructed
any
amount
of
such
auxiliary
works
between
the
permanent
forts
these
need
no
fixed
guns
to
be
emplaced
since
the
french
can
use
now
one
such
parapet
now
another
as
occasion
serves
and
the
advantage
is
that
your
guns
are
never
useless
but
can
always
be
brought
round
where
they
are
needed
and
that
thus
six
guns
will
do
more
work
than
twenty
used
to
do
this
false
battery
was
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
when
i
reached
it
i
looked
down
the
slope
over
the
brushwood
that
hid
the
wire
entanglements
and
there
was
the
whole
valley
of
the
moselle
at
my
feet
as
this
was
the
first
really
great
height
so
this
was
the
first
really
great
view
that
i
met
with
on
my
pilgrimage
i
drew
it
carefully
piece
by
piece
sitting
there
a
long
time
in
the
declining
sun
and
noting
all
i
saw
archettes
just
below
the
flat
valley
with
the
river
winding
from
side
to
side
the
straight
rows
of
poplar
trees
the
dark
pines
on
the
hills
and
the
rounded
mountains
rising
farther
and
higher
into
the
distance
until
the
last
i
saw
far
off
to
the
must
have
been
the
ballon
at
the
sources
of
the
moselle
the
hill
that
marked
the
first
full
stage
in
my
journey
and
that
overlooked
switzerland
indeed
this
is
the
peculiar
virtue
of
walking
to
a
far
place
and
especially
of
walking
there
in
a
straight
line
that
one
gets
these
visions
of
the
world
from
when
i
call
up
for
myself
this
great
march
i
see
it
all
mapped
out
in
landscapes
each
of
which
i
caught
from
some
mountain
and
each
of
which
joins
on
to
that
before
and
to
that
after
it
till
i
can
piece
together
the
whole
road
the
view
here
from
the
hill
of
archettes
the
view
from
the
ballon
from
glovelier
hill
from
the
weissenstein
from
the
brienzer
grat
from
the
grimsel
from
above
bellinzona
from
the
principessa
from
tizzano
from
the
ridge
of
the
apennines
from
the
wall
of
siena
from
san
quirico
from
radicofani
from
san
lorenzo
from
montefiascone
from
above
viterbo
from
roncigleone
and
at
last
from
that
lift
in
the
via
cassia
whence
one
suddenly
perceives
the
city
they
unroll
themselves
all
in
their
order
till
i
can
see
europe
and
rome
shining
at
the
end
but
you
who
go
in
railways
are
necessarily
shut
up
in
long
valleys
and
even
sometimes
by
the
walls
of
the
earth
even
those
who
bicycle
or
drive
see
these
sights
but
rarely
and
with
no
consecution
since
roads
also
avoid
climbing
save
where
they
are
forced
to
it
as
over
certain
passes
it
is
only
by
following
the
straight
line
onwards
that
any
one
can
pass
from
ridge
to
ridge
and
have
this
full
picture
of
the
way
he
has
been
so
much
for
views
i
clambered
down
the
hill
to
archettes
and
saw
almost
the
first
house
a
swinging
board
the
sign
of
the
trout
of
the
vosges
and
as
it
was
now
evening
i
turned
in
there
to
dine
two
things
i
noticed
at
once
when
i
sat
down
to
meat
first
that
the
people
seated
at
that
inn
table
were
of
the
of
society
and
secondly
that
i
though
of
their
rank
was
an
impediment
to
their
enjoyment
for
to
sleep
in
woods
to
march
some
seventy
miles
the
latter
part
in
a
dazzling
sun
and
to
end
by
sliding
down
an
earthy
steep
into
the
road
stamps
a
man
with
all
that
this
kind
of
people
least
desire
to
have
thrust
upon
them
and
those
who
blame
the
for
their
conventions
in
such
matters
and
who
profess
to
be
above
the
care
for
cleanliness
and
clothes
and
social
ritual
which
marks
the
are
either
anarchists
by
nature
or
fools
who
take
what
is
but
an
effect
of
their
wealth
for
a
natural
virtue
i
say
it
roundly
if
it
were
not
for
the
punctiliousness
of
the
in
these
matters
all
our
civilization
would
go
to
pieces
they
are
the
conservators
and
the
maintainers
of
the
standard
the
moderators
of
europe
the
salt
of
society
for
the
kind
of
man
who
boasts
that
he
does
not
mind
dirty
clothes
or
roughing
it
is
either
a
man
who
cares
nothing
for
all
that
civilization
has
built
up
and
who
rather
hates
it
or
else
and
this
is
much
more
common
he
is
a
rich
man
or
accustomed
to
live
among
the
rich
and
can
afford
to
waste
energy
and
stuff
because
he
feels
in
a
vague
way
that
more
clothes
can
always
be
bought
that
at
the
end
of
his
vagabondism
he
can
get
excellent
dinners
and
that
london
and
paris
are
full
of
luxurious
baths
and
barber
shops
of
all
the
corrupting
effects
of
wealth
there
is
none
worse
than
this
that
it
makes
the
wealthy
and
their
parasites
think
in
some
way
divine
or
at
least
a
lovely
character
of
the
mind
what
is
in
truth
nothing
but
their
power
of
luxurious
living
heaven
keep
us
all
from
great
riches
i
mean
from
very
great
riches
now
the
can
not
afford
to
buy
new
clothes
whenever
they
feel
inclined
neither
can
they
end
up
a
jaunt
by
a
turkish
bath
and
a
great
feast
with
wine
so
their
care
is
always
to
preserve
intact
what
they
happen
to
have
to
exceed
in
nothing
to
study
cleanliness
order
decency
sobriety
and
a
steady
temper
and
they
fence
all
this
round
and
preserve
it
in
the
only
way
it
can
be
preserved
to
wit
with
conventions
and
they
are
quite
right
i
find
it
very
hard
to
keep
up
to
the
demands
of
these
my
colleagues
but
i
recognize
that
they
are
on
the
just
side
in
the
quarrel
let
none
of
them
go
about
pretending
that
i
have
not
defended
them
in
this
book
so
i
thought
of
how
i
should
put
myself
right
with
these
people
i
saw
that
an
elaborate
story
as
that
i
had
been
set
upon
by
a
tramp
who
forced
me
to
change
clothes
that
i
dressed
thus
for
a
bet
that
i
was
an
officer
employed
as
a
spy
and
was
about
to
cross
the
frontier
into
germany
in
the
guise
of
a
labourer
that
my
doctor
forbade
me
to
shave
or
any
other
such
rhodomontade
i
saw
i
say
that
by
venturing
upon
any
such
excuses
i
might
unwittingly
offend
some
other
unknown
canon
of
theirs
deeper
and
more
sacred
than
their
rule
on
clothes
it
had
happened
to
me
before
now
to
do
this
in
the
course
of
explanations
so
i
took
another
method
and
said
as
i
sat
down
excuse
this
appearance
of
mine
i
have
had
a
most
unfortunate
adventure
in
the
hills
losing
my
way
and
being
compelled
to
sleep
out
all
night
nor
can
i
remain
to
get
tidy
as
it
is
essential
that
i
should
reach
my
luggage
which
is
at
remiremont
before
midnight
i
took
great
care
to
pay
for
my
glass
of
white
wine
before
dinner
with
a
and
i
showed
my
sketches
to
my
neighbour
to
make
an
impression
i
also
talked
of
foreign
politics
of
the
countries
i
had
seen
of
england
especially
with
such
minute
exactitude
that
their
disgust
was
soon
turned
to
admiration
the
hostess
of
this
inn
was
delicate
and
courteous
to
a
degree
and
at
every
point
attempting
to
overreach
her
guests
who
as
regularly
as
she
attacked
countered
with
astonishing
dexterity
thus
she
would
say
the
joint
would
taste
better
if
it
were
carved
on
the
table
or
do
the
gentlemen
prefer
it
carved
aside
to
which
a
banker
opposite
me
said
in
a
deep
voice
prefer
madam
to
have
it
carved
aside
or
she
would
put
her
head
in
and
say
can
recommend
our
excellent
beer
it
is
really
preferable
to
this
local
wine
and
my
neighbour
a
tourist
answered
with
decision
we
find
your
wine
excellent
it
could
not
be
bettered
nor
could
she
get
round
them
on
a
single
point
and
i
pitied
her
so
much
that
i
bought
bread
and
wine
off
her
to
console
her
and
i
let
her
overcharge
me
and
went
out
into
the
afterglow
with
her
benediction
followed
also
by
the
farewells
of
the
who
were
now
taking
their
coffee
at
little
tables
outside
the
house
i
went
hard
up
the
road
to
remiremont
the
night
darkened
i
reached
remiremont
at
midnight
and
feeling
very
wakeful
i
pushed
on
up
the
valley
under
great
woods
of
pines
and
at
last
diverging
up
a
little
path
i
settled
on
a
clump
of
trees
sheltered
and
as
i
thought
warm
and
lay
down
there
to
sleep
till
morning
but
on
the
contrary
i
lay
awake
a
full
hour
in
the
fragrance
and
on
the
level
carpet
of
the
pine
needles
looking
up
through
the
dark
branches
at
the
waning
moon
which
had
just
risen
and
thinking
of
how
suitable
were
for
a
man
to
sleep
under
beech
i
thought
a
good
tree
to
sleep
under
for
nothing
will
grow
there
and
there
is
always
dry
the
yew
would
be
good
if
it
did
not
grow
so
low
but
all
in
all
are
the
best
i
also
considered
that
the
worst
tree
to
sleep
under
would
be
the
upas
tree
these
thoughts
so
nearly
bordered
on
nothing
that
though
i
was
not
sleepy
yet
i
fell
asleep
long
before
day
the
moon
being
still
lustrous
against
a
sky
that
yet
contained
a
few
faint
stars
i
awoke
shivering
with
cold
in
sleep
there
is
something
diminishes
us
this
every
one
has
noticed
for
who
ever
suffered
a
nightmare
awake
or
felt
in
full
consciousness
those
awful
impotencies
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
slumber
when
we
lie
down
we
give
ourselves
voluntarily
yet
by
the
force
of
nature
to
powers
before
which
we
melt
and
are
nothing
and
among
the
strange
frailties
of
sleep
i
have
noticed
cold
here
was
a
warm
place
under
the
pines
where
i
could
rest
in
great
comfort
on
pine
needles
still
full
of
the
day
a
covering
for
the
beasts
underground
that
love
an
even
heat
the
best
of
floors
for
a
tired
man
even
the
slight
wind
that
blew
under
the
waning
moon
was
warm
and
the
stars
were
languid
and
not
brilliant
as
though
everything
were
full
of
summer
and
i
knew
that
the
night
would
be
short
a
midsummer
night
and
i
had
lived
half
of
it
before
attempting
repose
yet
i
say
i
woke
shivering
and
also
disconsolate
needing
companionship
i
pushed
down
through
tall
rank
grass
drenched
with
dew
and
made
my
way
across
the
road
to
the
bank
of
the
river
by
the
time
i
reached
it
the
dawn
began
to
occupy
the
east
for
a
long
time
i
stood
in
a
favoured
place
just
above
a
bank
of
trees
that
lined
the
river
and
watched
the
beginning
of
the
day
because
every
slow
increase
of
light
promised
me
sustenance
the
faint
uncertain
glimmer
that
seemed
not
so
much
to
shine
through
the
air
as
to
be
part
of
it
took
all
colour
out
of
the
woods
and
fields
and
the
high
slopes
above
me
leaving
them
planes
of
grey
and
deeper
grey
the
woods
near
me
were
a
silhouette
black
and
motionless
emphasizing
the
east
beyond
the
river
was
white
and
dead
not
even
a
steam
rose
from
it
but
out
of
the
further
pastures
a
gentle
mist
had
lifted
up
and
lay
all
even
along
the
flanks
of
the
hills
so
that
they
rose
out
of
it
indistinct
at
their
bases
above
against
the
brightening
sky
and
the
farther
they
were
the
more
their
mouldings
showed
in
the
early
light
and
the
most
distant
edges
of
all
caught
the
morning
at
this
wonderful
sight
i
gazed
for
quite
without
moving
and
took
in
vigour
from
it
as
a
man
takes
in
food
and
wine
when
i
stirred
and
looked
about
me
it
had
become
easy
to
see
the
separate
grasses
a
bird
or
two
had
begun
little
interrupted
chirrups
in
the
bushes
a
broke
from
up
the
valley
ruffling
the
silence
the
moon
was
dead
against
the
sky
and
the
stars
had
disappeared
in
a
solemn
mood
i
regained
the
road
and
turned
my
face
towards
the
neighbouring
sources
of
the
river
i
easily
perceived
with
each
laborious
mile
that
i
was
approaching
the
end
of
my
companionship
with
the
moselle
which
had
become
part
of
my
adventure
for
the
last
eighty
miles
it
was
now
a
small
stream
mountainous
and
uncertain
though
in
parts
still
placid
and
slow
there
appeared
also
that
which
i
take
to
be
an
infallible
accompaniment
of
secluded
glens
and
of
the
head
waters
of
rivers
however
canalized
or
even
overbuilt
they
are
i
mean
a
certain
roughness
all
about
them
and
the
stout
protest
of
the
their
stone
cottages
and
their
lonely
paths
off
the
road
so
it
was
here
the
hills
had
grown
much
higher
and
come
closer
to
the
up
the
gullies
i
would
catch
now
and
then
an
aged
and
uncouth
bridge
with
a
hut
near
it
all
built
of
enduring
stone
part
of
the
hills
then
again
there
were
present
here
and
there
on
the
spurs
lonely
chapels
and
these
in
catholic
countries
are
a
mark
of
the
mountains
and
of
the
end
of
the
riches
of
a
valley
why
this
should
be
so
i
can
not
tell
you
find
them
also
sometimes
in
forests
but
especially
in
the
lesser
inlets
of
the
and
as
i
have
said
here
in
the
upper
parts
of
valleys
in
the
great
hills
in
such
shrines
mass
is
to
be
said
but
rarely
sometimes
but
once
a
year
in
a
special
commemoration
the
rest
of
the
time
they
stand
empty
and
some
of
the
older
or
simpler
one
might
take
for
ruins
they
mark
everywhere
some
strong
emotion
of
supplication
thanks
or
reverence
and
they
anchor
these
wild
places
to
their
own
past
making
them
up
in
memories
what
they
lack
in
multitudinous
life
i
broke
my
fast
on
bread
and
wine
at
a
place
where
the
road
crosses
the
river
and
then
i
determined
i
would
have
hot
coffee
as
well
and
seeing
in
front
of
me
a
village
called
rupt
which
means
for
there
is
here
a
great
cleft
in
the
hillside
i
went
up
to
it
and
had
my
coffee
then
i
discovered
a
singular
thing
that
the
people
of
the
place
are
tired
of
making
up
names
and
give
nothing
its
peculiar
baptism
this
i
thought
really
very
wonderful
indeed
for
i
have
noticed
wherever
i
have
been
that
in
proportion
as
men
are
remote
and
have
little
to
distract
them
in
that
proportion
they
produce
a
great
crop
of
peculiar
local
names
for
every
stream
reach
tuft
hummock
glen
copse
and
gully
for
miles
around
and
often
when
i
have
lost
my
way
and
asked
it
of
a
peasant
in
some
lonely
part
i
have
grown
impatient
as
he
wandered
on
about
on
your
left
the
stone
we
call
the
nuggin
and
bearing
round
what
some
call
holy
dyke
till
you
come
to
what
they
call
mary
ferry
and
so
forth
and
the
riparian
inhabitants
of
dreadful
and
lonely
rivers
near
the
sea
have
just
such
a
habit
and
i
have
in
my
mind
eye
now
a
short
stretch
of
tidal
water
in
which
there
are
but
five
shoals
yet
they
all
have
names
and
are
called
house
the
knowle
goodman
plot
mall
and
the
patch
but
here
in
rupt
to
my
extreme
astonishment
there
was
no
such
universal
and
human
instinct
for
i
said
to
the
old
man
who
poured
me
out
my
coffee
under
the
trellis
it
was
full
morning
the
sun
was
well
up
and
the
clouds
were
all
dappled
high
above
the
tops
of
the
mountains
what
do
you
call
this
hill
and
with
that
i
pointed
to
a
very
remarkable
hill
and
summit
that
lie
sheer
above
the
village
he
said
called
the
hill
over
above
rupt
of
course
i
said
what
is
its
name
is
its
name
he
answered
and
he
was
quite
right
for
when
i
looked
at
my
map
there
it
was
printed
above
rupt
i
thought
how
wearisome
it
would
be
if
this
became
a
common
way
of
doing
things
and
if
one
should
call
the
thames
river
of
london
and
essex
north
side
and
kent
south
side
but
considering
that
this
fantastic
method
was
only
indulged
in
by
one
wretched
village
i
released
myself
from
fear
relegated
such
horrors
to
the
colonies
and
took
the
road
again
all
this
upper
corner
of
the
valley
is
a
garden
it
is
bound
in
on
every
side
from
the
winds
it
is
closed
at
the
end
by
the
great
mass
of
the
ballon
its
floor
is
smooth
and
level
its
richness
is
used
to
feed
grass
and
pasturage
and
knots
of
trees
grow
about
it
as
though
they
had
been
planted
to
please
the
eye
nothing
can
take
from
the
sources
of
rivers
their
character
of
isolation
and
repose
here
what
are
afterwards
to
become
the
influences
of
the
plains
are
nurtured
and
tended
as
though
in
an
orchard
and
the
future
life
of
a
whole
fruitful
valley
with
its
regal
towns
is
determined
something
about
these
places
prevents
ingress
or
spoliation
they
will
endure
no
settlements
save
of
peasants
the
waters
are
too
young
to
be
harnessed
the
hills
forbid
an
easy
commerce
with
neighbours
throughout
the
world
i
have
found
the
heads
of
rivers
to
be
secure
places
of
silence
and
content
and
as
they
are
themselves
a
kind
of
youth
the
early
home
of
all
that
rivers
must
at
last
become
i
mean
special
ways
of
building
and
a
separate
state
of
living
a
local
air
and
a
tradition
of
history
for
rivers
are
always
the
makers
of
provinces
so
they
bring
extreme
youth
back
to
one
and
these
upper
glens
of
the
world
steep
one
in
simplicity
and
childhood
it
was
my
delight
to
lie
upon
a
bank
of
the
road
and
to
draw
what
i
saw
before
me
which
was
the
tender
stream
of
the
moselle
slipping
through
fields
quite
flat
and
even
and
undivided
by
fences
its
banks
had
here
a
strange
effect
of
nature
copying
man
art
they
seemed
a
park
and
the
river
wound
through
it
full
of
the
positive
innocence
that
attaches
to
virgins
it
nourished
and
was
guarded
by
trees
there
was
about
that
scene
something
of
creation
and
of
a
beginning
and
as
i
drew
it
it
gave
me
like
a
gift
the
freshness
of
the
first
experiences
of
living
and
filled
me
with
remembered
springs
i
mused
upon
the
birth
of
rivers
and
how
they
were
persons
and
had
a
name
were
kings
and
grew
strong
and
ruled
great
countries
and
how
at
last
they
reached
the
sea
but
while
i
was
thinking
of
these
things
and
seeing
in
my
mind
a
kind
of
picture
of
the
river
valley
and
of
men
clustering
around
their
home
stream
and
of
its
ultimate
vast
plains
on
either
side
and
of
the
white
line
of
the
sea
beyond
all
a
woman
passed
me
she
was
very
ugly
and
was
dressed
in
black
her
dress
was
stiff
and
shining
and
as
i
imagined
valuable
she
had
in
her
hand
a
book
known
to
the
french
as
roman
parishioner
which
is
a
her
hair
was
hidden
in
a
stiff
cap
or
bonnet
she
walked
rapidly
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
when
i
saw
this
sight
it
reminded
me
suddenly
and
i
cried
out
profanely
take
me
it
is
corpus
christi
and
my
third
day
out
it
would
be
a
wicked
pilgrimage
if
i
did
not
get
mass
at
last
for
my
first
day
if
you
remember
i
had
slept
in
a
wood
beyond
and
my
second
if
you
remember
i
had
slept
in
a
bed
but
this
third
day
a
great
feast
into
the
bargain
i
was
bound
to
hear
mass
and
this
woman
hurrying
along
to
the
next
village
proved
that
i
was
not
too
late
so
i
hurried
in
her
wake
and
came
to
the
village
and
went
into
the
church
which
was
very
full
and
came
down
out
of
it
the
mass
was
low
and
short
they
are
a
christian
people
through
an
avenue
of
small
trees
and
large
branches
set
up
in
front
of
the
houses
to
welcome
the
procession
that
was
to
be
held
near
noon
at
the
foot
of
the
street
was
an
inn
where
i
entered
to
eat
and
finding
there
another
man
i
take
him
to
have
been
a
shopkeeper
i
determined
to
talk
politics
and
began
as
follows
you
any
in
your
town
is
not
my
town
he
said
there
is
it
flourishes
then
i
asked
many
jews
have
you
in
your
town
he
said
there
were
seven
said
i
families
of
jews
are
not
seven
families
he
interrupted
are
seven
jews
all
told
there
are
but
two
families
and
i
am
reckoning
in
the
children
the
servants
are
christians
said
i
is
only
just
and
proper
that
the
jewish
families
from
beyond
the
frontier
should
have
local
christian
people
to
wait
on
them
and
do
their
bidding
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
so
very
few
jews
seem
to
me
an
insufficient
fuel
to
fire
the
how
does
their
opinion
flourish
this
way
he
answered
jews
you
see
ridicule
our
young
men
for
holding
such
superstitions
as
the
catholic
our
young
men
thus
brought
to
book
and
made
to
feel
irrational
admit
the
justice
of
the
ridicule
but
nourish
a
hatred
secretly
for
those
who
have
exposed
their
folly
therefore
they
feel
a
standing
grudge
against
the
jews
when
he
had
given
me
this
singular
analysis
of
that
part
of
the
politics
of
the
mountains
he
added
after
a
short
silence
the
following
remarkable
phrase
my
part
i
am
a
liberal
and
would
have
each
go
his
own
way
the
catholic
to
his
mass
the
jew
to
his
sacrifice
i
then
rose
from
my
meal
saluted
him
and
went
musing
up
the
valley
road
pondering
upon
what
it
could
be
that
the
jews
sacrificed
in
this
remote
borough
but
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
what
it
was
though
i
have
had
a
great
many
jews
among
my
friends
i
was
now
arrived
at
the
head
of
this
lovely
vale
at
the
sources
of
the
river
moselle
and
the
base
of
the
great
mountain
the
ballon
which
closes
it
in
like
a
wall
at
the
end
of
a
lane
for
some
miles
past
the
hills
had
grown
higher
and
higher
upon
either
side
the
valley
floor
narrower
the
torrent
less
abundant
there
now
stood
up
before
me
the
marshy
slopes
and
the
enormous
forests
of
pine
that
forbid
a
passage
south
up
through
these
the
main
road
has
been
pierced
tortuous
and
at
an
even
gradient
mile
after
mile
to
the
very
top
of
the
hill
for
the
ballon
is
so
shaped
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
moselle
valley
to
communicate
with
the
gap
of
belfort
save
by
some
track
right
over
its
summit
for
it
is
a
mountain
with
spurs
like
a
star
and
where
mountains
of
this
kind
block
the
end
of
main
valleys
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
road
leading
up
and
out
of
the
valley
to
go
over
their
highest
point
since
any
other
road
over
the
passes
or
shoulders
would
involve
a
second
climb
to
reach
the
country
beyond
the
reason
of
this
my
little
map
here
where
the
dark
stands
for
the
valley
and
the
light
for
the
high
places
will
show
better
than
a
long
description
not
that
this
map
is
of
the
ballon
in
particular
but
only
of
the
type
of
hill
i
mean
since
in
crossing
a
range
it
is
usually
possible
to
find
a
low
point
suitable
for
surmounting
it
such
summit
roads
are
rare
but
when
one
does
get
them
they
are
the
finest
travel
in
the
world
for
they
furnish
at
one
point
that
is
at
the
summit
what
ordinary
roads
going
through
passes
can
never
give
you
a
moment
of
domination
from
their
climax
you
look
over
the
whole
world
and
you
feel
your
journey
to
be
adventurous
and
your
advance
to
have
taken
some
great
definite
step
from
one
province
and
people
to
another
i
would
not
be
bound
by
the
exaggerated
of
the
road
which
had
been
built
for
artillery
and
rose
at
an
easy
slope
i
went
along
the
bed
of
the
dell
before
me
and
took
the
forest
by
a
little
path
that
led
straight
upward
and
when
the
path
failed
my
way
was
marked
by
the
wire
of
the
telegraph
that
crosses
to
belfort
as
i
rose
i
saw
the
forest
before
me
grow
grander
the
pine
branches
came
down
from
the
trunks
with
a
greater
burden
and
majesty
in
their
sway
the
trees
took
on
an
appearance
of
solemnity
and
the
whole
rank
that
faced
me
for
here
the
woods
come
to
an
even
line
and
stand
like
an
army
arrested
upon
a
downward
march
seemed
something
unusual
and
gigantic
nothing
more
helped
this
impression
of
awe
than
the
extreme
darkness
beneath
those
aged
growths
and
the
change
in
the
sky
that
introduced
my
entry
into
the
silence
and
perfume
of
so
vast
a
temple
great
clouds
so
charged
with
rain
that
you
would
have
thought
them
lower
than
the
hills
and
yet
just
missing
their
tops
came
covering
me
like
a
tumbled
roof
and
gathered
all
around
the
heat
of
the
day
waned
suddenly
in
their
shade
it
seemed
suddenly
as
though
summer
was
over
or
as
though
the
mountains
demanded
an
uncertain
summer
of
their
own
and
shot
the
sunshine
with
the
chill
of
their
heights
a
little
wind
ran
along
the
grass
and
died
again
as
i
gained
the
darkness
of
the
first
trees
rain
was
falling
the
silence
of
the
interior
wood
was
enhanced
by
a
bare
drip
of
water
from
the
boughs
that
stood
out
straight
and
tangled
i
know
not
how
far
above
me
its
gloom
was
rendered
more
tremendous
by
the
and
lowering
of
the
sky
which
the
ceiling
of
branches
concealed
height
stillness
and
a
sort
of
expectancy
controlled
the
memories
of
the
place
and
i
passed
silently
and
lightly
between
the
high
columns
of
the
trees
from
night
as
it
seemed
through
a
kind
of
twilight
forward
to
a
near
night
beyond
on
every
side
the
perspective
of
these
bare
innumerable
shafts
each
standing
apart
in
order
purple
and
fragrant
merged
into
recesses
of
distance
where
all
light
disappeared
yet
as
i
advanced
the
slight
gloaming
still
surrounded
me
as
did
the
stillness
framed
in
the
drip
of
water
and
beneath
my
feet
was
the
level
carpet
of
the
pine
needles
deadening
and
making
distant
every
tiny
noise
had
not
the
trees
been
so
much
greater
and
more
enduring
than
my
own
presence
and
had
not
they
overwhelmed
me
by
their
regard
i
should
have
felt
afraid
as
it
was
i
pushed
upward
through
their
immovable
host
in
some
such
catching
of
the
breath
as
men
have
when
they
walk
at
night
straining
for
a
sound
and
i
felt
myself
to
be
continually
in
a
hidden
companionship
when
i
came
to
the
edge
of
this
haunted
forest
it
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
i
left
behind
me
such
a
rank
of
trees
aligned
as
i
had
entered
thousands
of
feet
below
and
i
saw
before
me
stretching
shapely
up
to
the
sky
the
round
summit
of
the
mountain
a
great
field
of
grass
it
was
already
evening
and
as
though
the
tall
trees
had
withdrawn
their
virtue
from
me
my
fatigue
suddenly
came
upon
me
my
feet
would
hardly
bear
me
as
i
clambered
up
the
last
hundred
feet
and
looked
down
under
the
rolling
clouds
lit
from
beneath
by
the
level
light
of
evening
to
the
three
countries
that
met
at
my
feet
for
the
ballon
is
the
knot
of
europe
and
from
that
gathering
up
and
ending
of
the
vosges
you
look
down
upon
three
divisions
of
men
to
the
right
of
you
are
the
gauls
i
do
not
mean
that
mixed
breed
of
lorraine
silent
among
the
best
of
people
but
i
mean
the
tree
gauls
who
are
hot
ready
and
born
in
the
plains
and
in
the
vineyards
they
stand
in
their
old
entrenchments
on
either
side
of
the
saône
and
are
vivacious
in
battle
from
time
to
time
a
spirit
urges
them
and
they
go
out
conquering
eastward
in
the
germanics
or
in
asia
or
down
the
peninsulas
of
the
mediterranean
and
then
they
suck
back
like
a
tide
homewards
having
accomplished
nothing
but
an
epic
then
on
the
left
you
have
all
the
germanics
a
great
sea
of
confused
and
dreaming
people
lost
in
philosophies
and
creating
music
frozen
for
the
moment
under
a
foreign
rigidity
but
some
day
to
thaw
again
and
to
give
a
word
to
us
others
they
can
not
long
remain
apart
from
visions
then
in
front
of
you
southward
and
eastward
if
you
are
marching
to
rome
come
the
highlanders
i
had
never
been
among
them
and
i
was
to
see
them
in
a
day
the
people
of
the
high
hills
the
race
whom
we
all
feel
to
be
enemies
and
who
run
straight
across
the
world
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
understanding
each
other
not
understood
by
us
i
saw
their
first
rampart
the
mountains
called
the
jura
on
the
horizon
and
above
my
great
field
of
view
the
clouds
still
tumbled
lit
from
beneath
with
evening
i
tired
of
these
immensities
and
feeling
now
my
feet
more
broken
than
ever
i
very
slowly
and
in
sharp
shoots
of
pain
dragged
down
the
slope
towards
the
main
road
i
saw
just
below
me
the
frontier
stones
of
the
prussians
and
immediately
within
them
a
hut
to
this
i
addressed
myself
it
was
an
inn
the
door
opened
of
itself
and
i
found
there
a
pleasant
woman
of
middle
age
but
frowning
she
had
three
daughters
all
of
great
strength
and
she
was
upbraiding
them
loudly
in
the
german
of
alsace
and
making
them
scour
and
scrub
on
the
wall
above
her
head
was
a
great
placard
which
i
read
very
tactfully
and
in
a
distant
manner
until
she
had
restored
the
discipline
of
her
family
this
great
placard
was
framed
in
the
three
colours
which
once
brought
a
little
hope
to
the
oppressed
and
at
the
head
of
it
in
broad
black
letters
were
the
three
words
brotherhood
and
an
equal
law
underneath
these
was
the
emblematic
figure
of
a
cock
which
i
took
to
be
the
gallic
bird
and
underneath
him
again
was
printed
in
enormous
italics
quand
ce
coq
chantera
ici
crédit
fera
which
means
when
you
hear
him
crowing
then
the
time
for
owing
till
that
day
pay
while
i
was
still
wondering
at
this
epitome
of
the
french
people
and
was
attempting
to
combine
the
french
military
tradition
with
the
french
temper
in
the
affairs
of
economics
while
i
was
also
delighting
in
the
memory
of
the
solid
coin
that
i
carried
in
a
little
leathern
bag
in
my
pocket
the
and
honest
woman
that
governs
the
little
house
and
the
three
great
daughters
within
a
yard
of
the
frontier
and
on
the
top
of
this
huge
hill
had
brought
back
all
her
troops
into
line
and
had
the
time
to
attend
to
me
this
she
did
with
the
utmost
politeness
though
cold
by
race
and
through
her
politeness
ran
a
sense
of
what
teutons
called
duty
which
would
once
have
repelled
me
but
i
have
wandered
over
a
great
part
of
the
world
and
i
know
it
now
to
be
a
distorted
kind
of
virtue
she
was
of
a
very
different
sort
from
that
good
tribe
of
the
moselle
valley
beyond
the
hill
yet
she
also
was
catholic
she
had
a
little
tree
set
up
before
her
door
for
the
corpus
christi
see
what
religion
is
that
makes
people
of
utterly
different
races
understand
each
other
for
when
i
saw
that
tree
i
knew
precisely
where
i
stood
so
once
all
we
europeans
understood
each
other
but
now
we
are
divided
by
the
worst
malignancies
of
nations
and
classes
and
a
man
does
not
so
much
love
his
own
nation
as
hate
his
neighbours
and
even
the
twilight
of
chivalry
is
mixed
up
with
a
detestable
patronage
of
the
poor
but
as
i
was
saying
she
also
was
a
catholic
and
i
knew
myself
to
be
with
friends
she
was
moreover
not
exactly
what
shall
i
say
the
words
celtic
and
latin
mean
nothing
not
of
those
who
delight
in
a
delicate
manner
and
her
good
heart
prompted
her
to
say
very
loudly
do
you
want
want
a
bed
i
said
and
i
pulled
out
a
silver
coin
must
lie
down
at
once
then
i
added
you
make
omelettes
now
it
is
a
curious
thing
and
one
i
will
not
dwell
on
lector
you
do
nothing
but
dwell
auctor
it
is
the
essence
of
lonely
travel
and
if
you
have
come
to
this
book
for
literature
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
booth
and
counter
as
i
was
saying
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
some
people
or
races
jump
from
one
subject
to
another
naturally
as
some
animals
i
mean
the
noble
deer
go
by
bounds
while
there
are
other
races
or
individuals
heaven
forgive
me
i
am
no
ethnologist
who
think
you
a
criminal
or
a
lunatic
unless
you
carefully
plod
along
from
step
to
step
like
a
hippopotamus
out
of
water
when
therefore
i
asked
this
woman
whether
she
could
make
omelettes
she
shook
her
head
at
me
slowly
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
mine
and
said
in
what
was
the
corpse
of
french
with
a
german
ghost
in
it
bed
is
a
franc
i
answered
i
mean
is
that
i
would
sleep
until
i
wake
for
i
have
come
a
prodigious
distance
and
have
last
slept
in
the
woods
but
when
i
wake
i
shall
need
food
for
which
i
added
pulling
out
yet
another
coin
will
pay
whatever
your
charge
may
be
for
a
more
delightful
house
i
have
rarely
met
with
i
know
most
people
do
not
sleep
before
sunset
but
i
am
particularly
tired
and
broken
she
showed
me
my
bed
then
much
more
kindly
and
when
i
woke
which
was
long
after
dusk
she
gave
me
in
the
living
room
of
the
hut
eggs
beaten
up
with
ham
and
i
ate
brown
bread
and
said
grace
then
my
wine
was
not
yet
finished
but
it
is
an
abominable
thing
to
drink
your
own
wine
in
another
person
house
i
asked
whether
i
could
have
something
to
drink
you
like
she
said
have
you
said
i
said
she
else
said
i
said
she
then
give
me
some
of
that
excellent
beer
i
drank
this
with
delight
paid
all
my
bill
which
was
that
of
a
labourer
and
said
to
them
in
they
had
a
ceremony
for
they
all
rose
together
and
curtsied
upon
my
soul
i
believe
such
people
to
be
the
salt
of
the
earth
i
bowed
with
real
contrition
for
at
several
moments
i
had
believed
myself
better
than
they
then
i
went
to
my
bed
and
they
to
theirs
the
wind
howled
outside
my
boots
were
stiff
like
wood
and
i
could
hardly
take
them
off
my
feet
were
so
martyrized
that
i
doubted
if
i
could
walk
at
all
on
the
morrow
nevertheless
i
was
so
wrapped
round
with
the
repose
of
this
family
virtues
that
i
fell
asleep
at
once
next
day
the
sun
was
rising
in
angry
glory
over
the
very
distant
hills
of
germany
his
new
light
running
between
the
pinnacles
of
the
clouds
as
the
commands
of
a
conqueror
might
come
trumpeted
down
the
defiles
of
mountains
when
i
fearlessly
forced
my
boots
on
to
my
feet
and
left
their
doors
the
morning
outside
came
living
and
sharp
after
the
gale
almost
chilly
under
a
scattered
but
clearing
sky
i
first
limped
then
as
my
blood
warmed
strode
down
the
path
that
led
between
the
trees
of
the
farther
vale
and
was
soon
following
a
stream
that
leaped
from
one
fall
to
another
till
it
should
lead
me
to
the
main
road
to
belfort
to
the
jura
to
the
swiss
whom
i
had
never
known
and
at
last
to
italy
but
before
i
call
up
the
recollection
of
that
hidden
valley
i
must
describe
with
a
map
the
curious
features
of
the
road
that
lay
before
me
into
switzerland
i
was
standing
on
the
summit
of
that
knot
of
hills
which
rise
up
from
every
side
to
form
the
ballon
and
make
an
abrupt
ending
to
the
vosges
before
me
southward
and
eastward
was
a
great
plain
with
the
fortress
of
belfort
in
the
midst
of
it
this
plain
is
called
by
soldiers
gap
of
belfort
and
is
the
only
break
in
the
hill
frontier
that
covers
france
all
the
way
from
the
mediterranean
to
flanders
on
the
farther
side
of
this
plain
ran
the
jura
mountains
which
are
like
a
northern
wall
to
switzerland
and
just
before
you
reach
them
is
the
frontier
the
jura
are
fold
on
fold
of
high
limestone
ridges
thousands
of
feet
high
all
parallel
with
deep
valleys
thousands
of
feet
deep
between
them
and
beyond
their
last
abrupt
escarpment
is
the
wide
plain
of
the
river
aar
now
the
straight
line
to
rome
ran
from
where
i
stood
right
across
that
plain
of
belfort
right
across
the
ridges
of
the
jura
and
cut
the
plain
of
the
aar
a
few
miles
to
the
west
of
a
town
called
solothurn
or
soleure
which
stands
upon
that
river
it
was
impossible
to
follow
that
line
exactly
but
one
could
average
it
closely
enough
by
following
the
high
road
down
the
mountain
through
belfort
to
a
swiss
town
called
porrentruy
or
portrut
so
far
one
was
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
direct
line
from
portrut
by
picking
one
way
through
forests
up
steep
banks
over
open
downs
along
mule
paths
and
so
forth
one
could
cross
the
first
ridge
called
the
hill
and
so
reach
the
profound
gorge
of
the
river
doubs
and
a
town
called
st
ursanne
from
st
ursanne
by
following
a
mountain
road
and
then
climbing
some
rocks
and
tracking
through
a
wood
one
could
get
straight
over
the
second
ridge
to
glovelier
from
glovelier
a
highroad
took
one
through
a
gap
to
undervelier
and
on
to
a
town
called
moutier
or
munster
then
from
munster
the
road
still
following
more
or
less
the
line
to
rome
but
now
somewhat
to
the
east
of
it
went
on
southward
till
an
abrupt
turn
in
it
forced
one
to
leave
it
then
there
was
another
rough
climb
by
a
difficult
path
up
over
the
last
ridge
called
the
weissenstein
and
from
its
high
edge
and
summit
it
was
but
a
straight
fall
of
a
mile
or
two
on
to
soleure
so
much
my
map
told
me
and
this
mixture
of
roads
and
paths
and
rock
climbs
that
i
had
planned
out
i
exactly
followed
so
as
to
march
on
as
directly
as
possible
towards
rome
which
was
my
goal
for
if
i
had
not
so
planned
it
but
had
followed
the
highroads
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
enormously
for
days
since
these
ridges
of
the
jura
are
but
little
broken
and
the
roads
do
not
rise
above
the
crests
but
follow
the
parallel
valleys
taking
advantage
only
here
and
there
of
the
rare
gaps
to
pass
from
one
to
another
here
is
a
sketch
of
the
way
i
went
where
my
track
is
a
white
line
and
the
round
spots
in
it
are
the
towns
and
villages
whose
names
are
written
at
the
side
in
this
sketch
the
plains
and
low
valleys
are
marked
dark
and
the
crests
of
the
mountains
left
white
the
shading
is
lighter
according
to
the
height
and
the
contour
lines
which
are
very
far
from
accurate
represent
i
suppose
about
a
thousand
feet
between
each
or
perhaps
a
little
more
and
as
for
the
distance
from
the
ballon
to
soleure
might
be
two
long
days
march
on
a
flat
road
but
over
mountains
and
up
rocks
it
was
all
but
three
and
even
that
was
very
good
going
my
first
stage
was
across
the
plain
of
belfort
and
i
had
determined
to
sleep
that
night
in
switzerland
i
wandered
down
the
mountain
a
little
secret
path
one
of
many
saved
me
the
long
windings
of
the
road
it
followed
down
the
central
hollow
of
the
great
cleft
and
accompanied
the
stream
all
the
way
for
miles
the
water
tumbled
in
fall
after
fall
over
a
hundred
steps
of
rock
and
its
noise
mixed
with
the
freshness
of
the
air
and
its
splashing
weighted
the
overhanging
branches
of
the
trees
a
little
rain
that
fell
from
time
to
time
through
the
clear
morning
seemed
like
a
sister
to
the
spray
of
the
waterfalls
and
what
with
all
this
moisture
and
greenery
and
the
surrounding
silence
all
the
valley
was
inspired
with
content
it
was
a
repose
to
descend
through
its
leaves
and
grasses
and
find
the
lovely
pastures
at
the
foot
of
the
descent
a
narrow
floor
between
the
hills
here
there
were
the
first
houses
of
men
and
from
one
smoke
was
already
going
up
thinly
into
the
morning
the
air
was
very
pure
and
cold
it
was
made
more
nourishing
and
human
by
the
presence
and
noise
of
the
waters
by
the
shining
wet
grasses
and
the
beaded
leaves
all
through
that
umbrageous
valley
the
shreds
of
clouds
which
high
above
the
calm
ran
swiftly
in
the
upper
air
fed
it
also
with
soft
rains
from
time
to
time
as
fine
as
dew
and
through
those
clear
and
momentary
showers
one
could
see
the
sunlight
when
i
had
enjoyed
the
descent
through
this
place
for
but
a
few
miles
everything
changed
the
road
in
front
ran
straight
and
bordered
it
led
out
and
onwards
over
a
great
flat
set
here
and
there
with
hillocks
the
vosges
ended
abruptly
houses
came
more
thickly
and
by
the
ceaseless
culture
of
the
fields
by
the
flat
slate
roofs
the
walls
and
the
voices
and
the
glare
i
knew
myself
to
be
once
more
in
france
of
the
plains
and
the
first
town
i
came
to
was
giromagny
here
as
i
heard
a
bell
i
thought
i
would
go
up
and
hear
mass
and
i
did
so
but
my
attention
at
the
holy
office
was
distracted
by
the
enormous
number
of
priests
that
i
found
in
the
church
and
i
have
wondered
painfully
ever
since
how
so
many
came
to
be
in
a
little
place
like
giromagny
there
were
three
priests
at
the
high
altar
and
nearly
one
for
each
chapel
and
there
was
such
a
buzz
of
masses
going
on
beginning
and
ending
that
i
am
sure
i
need
not
have
gone
without
my
breakfast
in
my
hurry
to
get
one
with
all
this
there
were
few
people
at
mass
so
early
nothing
but
these
priests
going
in
and
out
and
continual
little
bells
i
am
still
wondering
giromagny
is
no
place
for
relics
or
for
a
pilgrimage
it
cures
no
one
and
has
nothing
of
a
holy
look
about
it
and
all
these
priests
lector
pray
dwell
less
on
your
religion
and
auctor
pray
take
books
as
you
find
them
and
treat
travel
as
travel
for
you
when
you
go
to
a
foreign
country
see
nothing
but
what
you
expect
to
see
but
i
am
astonished
at
a
thousand
accidents
and
always
find
things
as
great
as
i
supposed
they
would
be
and
far
more
curious
the
whole
covered
by
a
strange
light
of
adventure
and
that
is
the
peculiar
value
of
this
book
now
if
you
can
explain
these
priests
lector
i
can
it
was
the
season
of
the
year
and
they
were
swarming
auctor
so
be
it
then
if
you
will
hear
nothing
of
what
interests
me
i
see
no
reason
for
setting
down
with
minute
care
what
interests
you
and
i
may
leave
out
all
mention
of
the
girl
who
could
only
speak
german
of
the
arrest
of
the
criminal
and
even
of
the
house
of
marshal
turenne
this
last
something
quite
exceptionally
entertaining
but
do
not
let
us
continue
thus
nor
push
things
to
an
open
quarrel
you
must
imagine
for
yourself
about
six
miles
of
road
and
then
then
in
the
increasing
heat
the
dust
rising
in
spite
of
the
morning
rain
and
the
road
most
wearisome
i
heard
again
the
sound
of
bugles
and
the
sombre
excitement
of
the
drums
it
is
a
thing
this
passing
from
one
great
garrison
to
another
all
the
way
down
the
frontier
i
had
started
from
the
busy
order
of
toul
i
had
passed
through
the
silence
and
peace
of
all
that
moselle
country
the
valley
like
a
long
garden
and
i
had
come
to
the
guns
and
the
tramp
of
épinal
i
had
left
épinal
and
counted
the
miles
and
miles
of
silence
in
the
forests
i
had
crossed
the
great
hills
and
come
down
into
quite
another
plain
draining
to
another
sea
and
i
heard
again
all
the
clamour
that
goes
with
soldiery
and
looking
backward
then
over
my
four
days
one
felt
one
almost
saw
the
new
system
of
fortification
the
vast
entrenched
camps
each
holding
an
army
the
ungarnished
gaps
between
as
i
came
nearer
to
belfort
i
saw
the
guns
going
at
a
trot
down
a
side
road
and
a
little
later
i
saw
marching
on
my
right
a
long
way
off
the
irregular
column
the
dust
and
the
invincible
gaiety
of
the
french
line
the
sun
here
and
there
glinted
on
the
ends
of
and
the
polished
pouches
their
heavy
pack
made
their
tramp
loud
and
thudding
they
were
singing
a
song
i
had
already
passed
the
outer
forts
i
had
noted
a
work
close
to
the
road
i
had
gone
on
a
mile
or
so
and
had
entered
the
long
and
ugly
suburb
where
the
tramway
lines
began
when
on
one
of
the
ramshackle
houses
of
that
burning
paved
and
noisy
endless
street
i
saw
written
up
the
words
wine
shut
or
open
as
it
is
a
great
rule
to
examine
every
new
thing
and
to
suck
honey
out
of
every
flower
i
did
not
as
some
would
think
the
phrase
odd
and
pass
on
i
stood
gazing
at
the
house
and
imagining
a
hundred
explanations
i
had
never
in
my
life
heard
wine
divided
into
shut
and
open
wine
i
determined
to
acquire
yet
one
more
great
experience
and
going
in
i
found
a
great
number
of
tin
cans
such
as
the
french
carry
up
water
in
without
covers
tapering
to
the
top
and
standing
about
three
feet
high
on
these
were
pasted
large
printed
labels
and
and
they
were
brimming
with
wine
i
spoke
to
the
woman
and
pointing
at
the
tin
cans
said
this
what
you
call
open
wine
yes
said
she
can
not
you
see
for
yourself
that
it
is
open
that
was
true
enough
and
it
explained
a
great
deal
but
it
did
not
explain
how
seeing
that
if
you
leave
a
bottle
of
wine
uncorked
for
ten
minutes
you
spoil
it
you
can
keep
gallons
of
it
in
a
great
wide
can
for
all
the
world
like
so
much
milk
milked
from
the
panthers
of
the
god
i
determined
to
test
the
prodigy
yet
further
and
choosing
the
middle
price
at
fourpence
a
quart
i
said
give
me
a
in
a
mug
this
the
woman
at
once
did
and
when
i
came
to
drink
it
it
was
delicious
sweet
cool
strong
lifting
the
heart
satisfying
and
full
of
all
those
things
talk
of
bouquet
and
body
and
flavour
it
was
what
i
have
heard
called
a
very
pretty
wine
i
did
not
wait
however
to
discuss
the
marvel
but
accepted
it
as
one
of
those
mysteries
of
which
this
pilgrimage
was
already
giving
me
examples
and
of
which
more
were
to
come
wait
till
you
hear
about
the
brigand
of
radicofani
i
said
to
myself
i
get
out
of
the
terre
majeure
and
away
from
the
strong
and
excellent
government
of
the
republic
when
i
am
lost
in
the
jura
hills
there
will
be
no
such
wine
as
this
so
i
bought
a
quart
of
it
corked
it
up
very
tight
put
it
in
my
sack
and
held
it
in
store
against
the
wineless
places
on
the
flanks
of
the
hill
called
terrible
where
there
are
no
soldiers
and
where
swiss
is
the
current
language
then
i
went
on
into
the
centre
of
the
town
as
i
passed
over
the
old
bridge
into
the
where
i
proposed
to
lunch
the
sun
was
terrible
it
was
close
upon
eleven
i
saw
them
building
parallel
with
that
old
bridge
a
new
one
to
replace
it
and
the
way
they
build
a
bridge
in
belfort
is
so
wonderfully
simple
and
yet
so
new
that
it
is
well
worth
telling
in
most
places
when
a
bridge
has
to
be
made
there
is
an
infinite
pother
and
worry
about
building
the
piers
and
heaven
knows
what
else
some
swing
their
bridges
to
avoid
this
trouble
and
some
try
to
throw
an
arch
of
one
span
from
side
to
side
there
are
a
thousand
different
tricks
in
belfort
they
simply
wait
until
the
water
has
run
away
then
a
great
brigade
of
workmen
run
down
into
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
and
dig
the
foundations
feverishly
and
begin
building
the
piers
in
great
haste
soon
the
water
comes
back
but
the
piers
are
already
above
it
and
the
rest
of
the
work
is
done
from
boats
this
is
absolutely
true
not
only
did
i
see
the
men
in
the
bed
of
the
river
but
a
man
whom
i
asked
told
me
that
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
natural
way
to
build
bridges
and
doubted
if
they
were
ever
made
in
any
other
fashion
there
is
also
in
belfort
a
great
lion
carved
in
rock
to
commemorate
the
siege
of
this
lion
is
part
of
the
precipice
under
the
castle
and
is
of
enormous
size
how
large
i
do
not
know
but
i
saw
that
a
man
looked
quite
small
by
one
of
his
paws
the
precipice
was
first
smoothed
like
a
stone
slab
or
tablet
and
then
this
lion
was
carved
into
and
out
of
it
in
high
relief
by
bartholdi
the
same
man
that
made
the
statue
of
liberty
in
new
york
harbour
the
siege
of
has
been
fixed
for
history
in
yet
another
way
and
one
that
shows
you
how
the
church
works
on
from
one
stem
continually
for
there
is
a
little
church
somewhere
near
or
in
belfort
i
do
not
know
where
i
only
heard
of
it
which
a
local
mason
and
painter
being
told
to
decorate
for
so
much
he
amused
himself
by
painting
all
round
it
little
pictures
of
the
siege
of
the
cold
and
the
wounds
and
the
heroism
this
is
indeed
the
way
such
things
should
be
done
i
mean
by
men
doing
them
for
pleasure
and
of
their
own
thought
and
i
have
a
number
of
friends
who
agree
with
me
in
thinking
this
that
art
should
not
be
competitive
or
industrial
but
most
of
them
go
on
to
the
very
strange
conclusion
that
one
should
not
own
one
garden
nor
beehive
nor
one
great
noble
house
nor
one
pigsty
nor
railway
shares
nor
the
very
boots
on
one
feet
i
say
out
upon
such
nonsense
then
they
say
to
me
what
about
the
concentration
of
the
means
of
production
and
i
say
to
them
what
about
the
distribution
of
the
ownership
of
the
concentrated
means
of
production
and
they
shake
their
heads
sadly
and
say
it
would
never
endure
and
i
say
try
it
first
and
see
then
they
fly
into
a
rage
when
i
lunched
in
belfort
and
at
lunch
by
the
way
a
poor
man
asked
me
to
use
my
for
his
son
who
was
an
engineer
in
the
navy
and
this
he
did
because
i
had
been
boasting
of
my
travels
experiences
and
grand
acquaintances
throughout
the
world
when
i
say
i
had
lunched
in
a
workman
cafe
at
belfort
i
set
out
again
on
my
road
and
was
very
much
put
out
to
find
that
showers
still
kept
on
falling
in
the
early
morning
under
such
delightful
trees
up
in
the
mountains
the
branches
had
given
me
a
roof
the
wild
surroundings
made
me
part
of
the
and
the
rain
had
seemed
to
marry
itself
to
the
pastures
and
the
foaming
beck
but
here
on
a
road
and
in
a
town
all
its
tradition
of
discomfort
came
upon
me
i
was
angry
therefore
with
the
weather
and
the
road
for
some
miles
till
two
things
came
to
comfort
me
first
it
cleared
and
a
glorious
sun
showed
me
from
a
little
eminence
the
plain
of
alsace
and
the
mountains
of
the
vosges
all
in
line
secondly
i
came
to
a
vast
to
most
people
there
is
nothing
more
subtle
or
pleasing
in
a
than
in
a
reservoir
they
are
both
much
the
same
in
the
mere
exterior
for
each
is
a
flat
platform
sloping
at
the
sides
and
covered
with
grass
and
each
has
mysterious
doors
but
for
my
part
i
never
see
a
without
being
filled
at
once
with
two
very
good
feelings
laughter
and
companionship
for
it
was
my
good
fortune
years
and
years
ago
to
be
companion
and
friend
to
two
men
who
were
on
sentry
at
a
just
after
there
had
been
some
anarchist
attempts
as
they
call
them
upon
such
depots
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
luscious
to
the
anarchist
than
seven
hundred
and
cases
of
powder
and
fifty
cases
of
melinite
all
stored
in
one
place
and
to
prevent
the
enormous
noise
confusion
and
waste
that
would
have
resulted
from
the
of
this
base
of
operations
to
the
anarchists
my
two
friends
one
of
whom
was
a
burgundian
but
the
other
a
loose
parisian
man
were
on
sentry
that
night
they
had
strict
orders
to
challenge
once
and
then
to
fire
now
can
you
imagine
anything
more
exquisite
to
a
poor
devil
of
a
conscript
fagged
out
with
garrison
duty
and
stale
than
an
order
of
that
kind
so
my
friends
took
it
and
in
one
summer
night
they
killed
a
donkey
and
wounded
two
mares
and
broke
the
thin
stem
of
a
growing
tree
this
was
no
exception
to
my
rule
for
as
i
approached
it
i
saw
a
corporal
and
two
men
looking
eagerly
to
see
who
might
be
attacking
their
treasure
and
i
became
quite
genial
in
my
mind
when
i
thought
of
how
proud
these
boys
felt
and
of
how
i
was
of
the
of
ninety
rifled
and
mounted
on
its
carriage
if
you
do
see
the
point
of
the
allusion
i
ca
stop
to
explain
it
it
was
a
good
gun
in
its
time
now
they
have
the
that
does
recoil
of
how
they
were
longing
for
the
night
and
a
chance
to
shoot
anything
on
the
sky
line
full
of
these
foolish
thoughts
but
smiling
in
spite
of
their
folly
i
went
down
the
road
shall
i
detail
all
that
afternoon
my
leg
horrified
me
with
dull
pain
and
made
me
fear
i
should
never
hold
out
i
do
not
say
to
rome
but
even
to
the
frontier
i
rubbed
it
from
time
to
time
with
balm
but
as
always
happens
to
miraculous
things
the
virtue
had
gone
out
of
it
with
the
lapse
of
time
at
last
i
found
a
side
road
going
off
from
the
main
way
and
my
map
told
me
it
was
on
the
whole
a
short
cut
to
the
frontier
i
determined
to
take
it
for
those
few
last
miles
because
if
one
is
suffering
a
winding
lane
is
more
tolerable
than
a
wide
turnpike
just
as
i
came
to
the
branching
of
the
roads
i
saw
a
cross
put
up
and
at
its
base
the
motto
that
is
universal
to
french
crosses
crux
spes
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
for
recollection
and
sitting
down
i
looked
backward
along
the
road
i
had
come
there
were
the
high
mountains
of
the
vosges
standing
up
above
the
plain
of
alsace
like
sloping
cliffs
above
a
sea
i
drew
them
as
they
stood
and
wondered
if
that
frontier
were
really
permanent
the
mind
of
man
is
greater
than
such
accidents
and
can
easily
overleap
even
the
high
hills
then
having
drawn
them
and
in
that
drawing
said
a
kind
of
farewell
to
the
influences
that
had
followed
me
for
so
many
miles
the
solemn
quiet
the
steady
industry
the
the
deep
woods
of
lorraine
rose
up
stiffly
from
the
bank
that
had
been
my
desk
and
pushed
along
the
lane
that
ran
devious
past
neglected
villages
the
afternoon
and
the
evening
followed
as
i
put
one
mile
after
another
behind
me
the
frontier
seemed
so
close
that
i
would
not
rest
i
left
my
open
wine
the
wine
i
had
found
outside
belfort
untasted
and
i
plodded
on
and
on
as
the
light
dwindled
i
was
in
a
grand
wonderment
for
switzerland
and
i
wished
by
an
immediate
effort
to
conquer
the
last
miles
before
night
in
spite
of
my
pain
also
i
will
confess
to
a
silly
pride
in
distances
and
a
desire
to
be
out
of
france
on
my
fourth
day
the
light
still
fell
and
my
resolution
stood
though
my
exhaustion
undermined
it
the
line
of
the
mountains
rose
higher
against
the
sky
and
there
entered
into
my
pilgrimage
for
the
first
time
the
loneliness
and
the
mystery
of
meres
something
of
what
a
man
feels
in
east
england
belonged
to
this
last
of
the
plain
under
the
guardian
hills
everywhere
i
passed
ponds
and
reeds
and
saw
the
level
streaks
of
sunset
reflected
in
stagnant
waters
the
marshy
valley
kept
its
character
when
i
had
left
the
lane
and
regained
the
highroad
its
isolation
dominated
the
last
effort
with
which
i
made
for
the
line
of
the
jura
in
that
summer
twilight
and
as
i
blundered
on
my
whole
spirit
was
caught
or
lifted
in
the
influence
of
the
waste
waters
and
of
the
birds
of
evening
i
wished
as
i
had
often
wished
in
such
opportunities
of
recollection
and
of
silence
for
a
complete
barrier
that
might
isolate
the
mind
with
that
wish
came
in
a
puzzling
thought
very
proper
to
a
pilgrimage
which
was
do
men
mean
by
the
desire
to
be
dissolved
and
to
enjoy
the
spirit
free
and
without
attachments
that
many
men
have
so
desired
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
the
best
men
whose
holiness
one
recognizes
at
once
tell
us
that
the
joys
of
the
soul
are
incomparably
higher
than
those
of
the
living
man
in
india
moreover
there
are
great
numbers
of
men
who
do
the
most
fantastic
things
with
the
object
of
thus
unprisoning
the
soul
and
milton
talks
of
the
same
thing
with
evident
conviction
and
the
saints
all
praise
it
in
chorus
but
what
is
it
for
my
part
i
can
not
understand
so
much
as
the
meaning
of
the
words
for
every
pleasure
i
know
comes
from
an
intimate
union
between
my
body
and
my
very
human
mind
which
last
receives
confirms
revives
and
can
summon
up
again
what
my
body
has
experienced
of
pleasures
however
in
which
my
senses
have
had
no
part
i
know
nothing
so
i
have
determined
to
take
them
upon
trust
and
see
whether
they
could
make
the
matter
clearer
in
rome
but
when
it
comes
to
the
immortal
mind
the
good
spirit
in
me
that
is
so
cunning
at
forms
and
colours
and
the
reasons
of
things
that
is
a
very
different
story
i
do
indeed
desire
to
have
to
myself
at
whiles
and
the
waning
light
of
a
day
or
the
curtains
of
autumn
closing
in
the
year
are
often
to
me
like
a
door
shutting
after
one
as
one
comes
in
home
for
i
find
that
with
less
and
less
impression
from
without
the
mind
seems
to
take
on
a
power
of
creation
and
by
some
mystery
it
can
project
songs
and
landscapes
and
faces
much
more
desirable
than
the
music
or
the
shapes
one
really
hears
and
sees
so
also
memory
can
create
but
it
is
not
the
soul
that
does
this
for
the
songs
the
landscapes
and
the
faces
are
of
a
kind
that
have
come
in
by
the
senses
nor
have
i
ever
understood
what
could
be
higher
than
these
pleasures
nor
indeed
how
in
anything
formless
and
immaterial
there
could
be
pleasure
at
all
yet
the
wisest
people
assure
us
that
our
souls
are
as
superior
to
our
minds
as
are
our
minds
to
our
inert
and
merely
material
bodies
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
as
i
was
pondering
on
these
things
in
this
land
of
pastures
and
lonely
ponds
with
the
wall
of
the
jura
black
against
the
narrow
bars
of
evening
my
pain
seemed
gone
for
a
moment
yet
i
was
hobbling
slowly
i
say
as
i
was
considering
this
complex
doctrine
i
felt
my
sack
suddenly
much
lighter
and
i
had
hardly
time
to
rejoice
at
the
miracle
when
i
heard
immediately
a
very
loud
crash
and
turning
half
round
i
saw
on
the
blurred
white
of
the
twilit
road
my
quart
of
open
wine
all
broken
to
atoms
my
disappointment
was
so
great
that
i
sat
down
on
a
milestone
to
consider
the
accident
and
to
see
if
a
little
thought
would
not
lighten
my
acute
annoyance
consider
that
i
had
carefully
cherished
this
bottle
and
had
not
drunk
throughout
a
painful
march
all
that
afternoon
thinking
that
there
would
be
no
wine
worth
drinking
after
i
had
passed
the
frontier
i
consoled
myself
more
or
less
by
thinking
about
torments
and
evils
to
which
even
such
a
loss
as
this
was
nothing
and
then
i
rose
to
go
on
into
the
night
as
it
turned
out
i
was
to
find
beyond
the
frontier
a
wine
in
whose
presence
this
wasted
wine
would
have
seemed
a
wretched
jest
and
whose
wonderful
taste
was
to
colour
all
my
memories
of
the
mount
terrible
it
is
always
thus
with
sorrows
if
one
will
only
wait
so
lighter
in
the
sack
but
heavier
in
the
heart
i
went
forward
to
cross
the
frontier
in
the
dark
i
did
not
quite
know
where
the
point
came
i
only
knew
that
it
was
about
a
mile
from
delle
the
last
french
town
i
supped
there
and
held
on
my
way
when
i
guessed
that
i
had
covered
this
mile
i
saw
a
light
in
the
windows
on
my
left
a
trellis
and
the
marble
tables
of
a
cafe
i
put
my
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
i
in
switzerland
a
girl
a
large
heavy
man
a
bavarian
commercial
traveller
and
a
colleague
of
his
from
marseilles
all
said
together
in
varying
accents
then
i
said
will
come
in
and
drink
this
book
would
never
end
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
write
down
so
much
as
the
names
of
a
quarter
of
the
extraordinary
things
that
i
saw
and
heard
on
my
enchanted
pilgrimage
but
let
me
at
least
mention
the
commercial
traveller
from
marseilles
he
talked
with
extreme
rapidity
for
two
hours
he
had
seen
all
the
cities
in
the
world
and
he
remembered
their
minutest
details
he
was
extremely
accurate
his
taste
was
abominable
his
patriotism
large
his
wit
crude
but
continual
and
to
his
german
friend
to
the
host
of
the
inn
and
to
the
blonde
he
was
a
familiar
god
he
came
it
seems
once
a
year
and
for
a
day
would
pour
out
the
torrent
of
his
travels
like
a
waterfall
of
for
he
gloried
in
dates
dimensions
and
the
points
of
the
compass
in
his
descriptions
then
he
disappeared
for
another
year
and
left
them
to
feast
on
the
memory
of
such
a
revelation
for
my
part
i
sat
silent
crippled
with
fatigue
trying
to
forget
my
wounded
feet
drinking
stoup
after
stoup
of
beer
and
watching
the
phocean
he
was
of
the
old
race
you
see
on
vases
in
red
and
black
slight
very
wiry
with
a
sharp
eager
but
face
a
small
black
pointed
beard
brilliant
eyes
like
those
of
lizards
rapid
gestures
and
a
vivacity
that
played
all
over
his
features
as
sheet
lightning
does
over
the
glow
of
midnight
in
june
that
delta
of
the
rhone
is
something
quite
separate
from
the
rest
of
france
it
is
a
wedge
of
greece
and
of
the
east
thrust
into
the
gauls
it
came
north
a
hundred
years
ago
and
killed
the
monarchy
it
caught
the
value
in
and
created
the
great
war
song
of
the
republic
i
watched
the
phocean
i
thought
of
a
man
of
his
ancestry
three
thousand
years
ago
sitting
here
at
the
gates
of
these
mountains
talking
of
his
travels
to
dull
patient
and
admiring
northerners
and
travelling
for
gain
up
on
into
the
germanics
and
i
felt
the
changeless
form
of
europe
under
me
like
a
rock
when
he
heard
i
was
walking
to
rome
this
man
of
information
turned
off
his
flood
into
another
channel
as
a
miller
will
send
the
racing
water
into
a
side
sluice
and
he
poured
out
some
such
torrent
as
this
not
omit
to
notice
the
famous
view
from
the
villa
so
and
so
on
monte
mario
visit
such
and
such
a
garden
and
hear
mass
in
such
and
such
a
church
note
the
curious
illusion
produced
on
the
piazza
of
st
peter
by
the
interior
measurements
of
the
trapezium
which
are
so
many
years
and
so
many
yards
and
so
forth
exactly
like
a
mill
i
meanwhile
sat
on
still
silent
still
drinking
beer
and
watching
the
phocean
gradually
suffering
the
fascination
that
had
captured
the
villagers
and
the
german
friend
he
was
a
very
wonderful
man
he
was
also
kindly
for
i
found
afterwards
that
he
had
arranged
with
the
host
to
give
me
up
his
bed
seeing
my
weariness
for
this
most
unluckily
i
was
never
able
to
thank
him
since
the
next
morning
i
was
off
before
he
or
any
one
else
was
awake
and
i
left
on
the
table
such
money
as
i
thought
would
very
likely
satisfy
the
innkeeper
it
was
broad
day
but
not
yet
sunrise
there
were
watery
thin
clouds
left
here
and
there
from
the
day
before
a
cold
wind
drove
them
when
with
extreme
pain
going
slowly
one
step
after
the
other
and
resting
continually
i
started
for
porrentruy
along
a
winding
road
and
pierced
the
gap
in
the
jura
the
first
turn
cut
me
off
from
france
and
i
was
fairly
in
a
strange
country
the
valley
through
which
i
was
now
passing
resembled
that
of
the
lovely
river
jed
where
it
runs
down
from
the
cheviots
and
leads
like
a
road
into
the
secret
pastures
of
the
lowlands
here
also
as
there
steep
cliffs
of
limestone
bounded
a
very
level
dale
all
green
grass
and
plenty
the
plateau
above
them
was
covered
also
with
perpetual
woods
only
here
different
from
scotland
the
woods
ran
on
and
upwards
till
they
became
the
slopes
of
high
mountains
indeed
this
winding
cleft
was
a
natural
passage
through
the
first
ridge
of
the
jura
the
second
stood
up
southward
before
me
like
a
deep
blue
storm
i
had
as
i
passed
on
along
this
turning
way
all
the
pleasures
of
novelty
it
was
quite
another
country
from
the
governed
and
ordered
france
which
i
had
left
the
road
was
more
haphazard
less
carefully
tended
and
evidently
less
used
the
milestones
were
very
old
and
marked
leagues
instead
of
kilometres
there
was
age
in
everything
moss
grew
along
the
walls
and
it
was
very
quiet
under
the
high
trees
i
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
little
river
that
went
slowly
through
the
meadows
nor
whether
it
followed
the
custom
of
its
french
neighbours
on
the
watershed
and
was
called
by
some
such
epithet
as
hangs
to
all
the
waters
in
that
gap
of
belfort
that
plain
of
ponds
and
marshes
for
they
are
called
sluggish
muddy
or
laggard
even
the
name
of
the
saone
far
off
meant
once
water
i
was
wondering
what
its
name
might
be
and
how
far
i
stood
from
porrentruy
which
i
knew
to
be
close
by
when
i
saw
a
tunnel
across
the
valley
and
i
guessed
by
the
trend
of
the
higher
hills
that
the
river
was
about
to
make
a
very
sharp
angle
both
these
signs
i
had
been
told
meant
that
i
was
quite
close
to
the
town
so
i
took
a
short
cut
up
through
the
forest
over
a
spur
of
hill
a
short
cut
most
legitimate
because
it
was
trodden
and
very
manifestly
used
and
i
walked
up
and
then
on
a
level
for
a
mile
along
a
lane
of
the
woods
and
beneath
small
dripping
trees
when
this
short
silence
of
the
forest
was
over
i
saw
an
excellent
sight
there
below
me
where
the
lane
began
to
fall
was
the
first
of
the
german
cities
lector
how
auctor
let
me
explain
there
is
a
race
that
stretches
vaguely
without
defined
boundaries
from
the
baltic
into
the
high
hills
of
the
south
i
will
not
include
the
scandinavians
among
them
for
the
scandinavians
from
whom
we
english
also
in
part
descend
are
lean
and
fierce
with
a
light
of
adventure
in
their
pale
eyes
but
beneath
them
i
say
there
stretches
from
the
baltic
to
the
high
hills
a
race
which
has
a
curious
unity
yes
i
know
that
great
patches
of
it
are
catholic
and
that
other
great
patches
hold
varying
philosophies
i
know
also
that
within
them
are
counted
and
men
dark
and
fair
violent
and
silent
i
know
also
that
they
have
continually
fought
among
themselves
and
called
in
welch
allies
still
i
go
somewhat
by
the
language
for
i
am
concerned
here
with
the
development
of
a
modern
european
people
and
i
say
that
the
germans
run
from
the
high
hills
to
the
northern
sea
in
all
of
them
you
find
it
is
not
race
it
is
something
much
more
than
race
it
is
the
type
of
culture
a
dreaminess
and
a
love
of
ease
in
all
of
them
you
find
music
they
are
those
germans
whose
countries
i
had
seen
a
long
way
off
from
the
ballon
and
whose
language
and
traditions
i
now
first
touched
in
the
town
that
stood
before
me
lector
but
in
porrentruy
they
talk
french
auctor
they
are
welcome
it
is
an
excellent
tongue
nevertheless
they
are
germans
who
but
germans
would
so
preserve
would
so
rebuild
the
past
who
but
germans
would
so
feel
the
mystery
of
the
hills
and
so
fit
their
town
to
the
mountains
i
was
to
pass
through
but
a
narrow
wedge
of
this
strange
and
diffuse
people
they
began
at
porrentruy
they
ended
at
the
watershed
of
the
adriatic
in
the
high
passes
of
the
alps
but
in
that
little
space
of
four
days
i
made
acquaintance
with
their
influence
and
i
owe
them
a
perpetual
gratitude
for
their
architecture
and
their
tales
i
had
come
from
france
which
is
full
of
an
active
memory
of
rome
i
was
to
debouch
into
those
larger
plains
of
italy
which
keep
about
them
an
atmosphere
of
rome
in
decay
here
in
switzerland
for
four
marches
i
touched
a
northern
exterior
and
barbaric
people
for
though
these
mountains
spoke
a
distorted
latin
tongue
and
only
after
the
first
day
began
to
give
me
a
teutonic
dialect
yet
it
was
evident
from
the
first
that
they
had
about
them
neither
the
latin
order
nor
the
latin
power
to
create
but
were
contemplative
and
easily
absorbed
by
a
little
effort
the
german
spirit
is
a
marvel
there
lay
porrentruy
an
odd
door
with
gothic
turrets
marked
the
entry
to
the
town
to
the
right
of
this
gateway
a
tower
more
enormous
than
anything
i
remembered
to
have
seen
even
in
dreams
flanked
the
approach
to
the
city
how
vast
it
was
how
protected
how
high
how
eaved
how
enduring
i
was
told
later
that
some
part
of
that
great
bastion
was
roman
and
i
can
believe
it
the
germans
hate
to
destroy
it
overwhelmed
me
as
visions
overwhelm
and
i
felt
in
its
presence
as
boys
feel
when
they
first
see
the
mountains
had
i
not
been
a
christian
i
would
have
worshipped
and
propitiated
this
obsession
this
everlasting
thing
as
it
was
i
entered
porrentruy
soberly
i
passed
under
its
deep
gateway
and
up
its
steep
hill
the
moment
i
was
well
into
the
main
street
something
other
of
the
middle
ages
possessed
me
and
i
began
to
think
of
food
and
wine
i
went
to
the
very
first
small
i
could
find
and
asked
them
if
they
could
serve
me
food
they
said
that
at
such
an
early
hour
it
was
not
yet
ten
they
could
give
me
nothing
but
bread
yesterday
meat
and
wine
i
said
that
would
do
very
well
and
all
these
things
were
set
before
me
and
by
a
custom
of
the
country
i
paid
before
i
ate
a
bad
custom
up
in
the
limousin
when
i
was
a
boy
in
the
noisy
valley
of
the
torrent
on
the
vienne
i
remember
a
woman
that
did
not
allow
me
to
pay
till
she
had
held
the
bottle
up
to
the
light
measured
the
veal
with
her
finger
and
estimated
the
bread
with
her
eye
also
she
charged
me
double
god
rest
her
soul
i
say
i
paid
and
had
i
had
to
pay
twenty
or
times
as
much
it
would
have
been
worth
it
for
the
wine
i
am
hurrying
on
to
rome
and
i
have
no
time
to
write
a
georgic
but
oh
my
little
friends
of
the
north
my
struggling
strenuous
introspective
autoscopic
and
generally
reentrant
friends
who
spout
the
pater
oh
lenae
without
a
ghost
of
an
idea
what
you
are
talking
about
do
you
know
what
is
meant
by
the
god
bacchus
is
everywhere
but
if
he
has
special
sites
to
be
ringed
in
and
kept
sacred
i
say
let
these
be
brule
and
the
silent
vineyard
that
lies
under
the
square
wood
by
tournus
the
hollow
underplace
of
heltz
le
maurupt
and
this
town
of
porrentruy
in
these
places
if
i
can
get
no
living
friends
to
help
me
i
will
strike
the
foot
alone
on
the
genial
ground
and
i
know
of
fifty
maenads
and
two
hundred
little
attendant
gods
by
name
that
will
come
to
the
festival
what
a
wine
i
was
assured
it
would
not
travel
said
i
me
a
good
quart
bottle
of
it
for
i
have
to
go
far
and
i
see
there
is
a
providence
for
pilgrims
so
they
charged
me
fourpence
and
i
took
my
bottle
of
this
wonderful
stuff
sweet
strong
sufficient
part
of
the
earth
desirable
and
went
up
on
my
way
to
rome
could
this
book
be
infinite
as
my
voyage
was
infinite
i
would
tell
you
about
the
shifty
priest
whom
i
met
on
the
platform
of
the
church
where
a
cliff
overhangs
the
valley
and
of
the
anarchist
whom
i
met
when
i
recovered
the
highroad
he
was
a
sad
good
man
who
had
committed
some
sudden
crime
and
so
had
left
france
and
his
hankering
for
france
all
those
years
had
soured
his
temper
and
he
said
he
wished
there
were
no
property
no
armies
and
no
governments
but
i
said
that
we
live
as
parts
of
a
nation
and
that
there
was
no
fate
so
wretched
as
to
be
without
a
country
of
one
own
what
else
was
exile
which
so
many
noble
men
have
thought
worse
than
death
and
which
all
have
feared
i
also
told
him
that
armies
fighting
in
a
just
cause
were
the
happiest
places
for
living
and
that
a
good
battle
for
justice
was
the
beginning
of
all
great
songs
and
that
as
for
property
a
man
on
his
own
land
was
the
nearest
to
god
he
therefore
not
convinced
and
i
loving
and
pitying
him
we
separated
i
had
not
time
to
preach
my
full
doctrine
but
gave
him
instead
a
deep
and
misty
glass
of
cool
beer
and
pledged
him
brotherhood
freedom
and
an
equal
law
then
i
went
on
my
way
praying
god
that
all
these
rending
quarrels
might
be
appeased
for
they
would
certainly
be
appeased
if
we
once
again
had
a
united
doctrine
in
europe
since
economics
are
but
an
expression
of
the
mind
and
do
not
as
the
poor
blind
slaves
of
the
great
cities
think
mould
the
mind
what
is
more
nothing
makes
property
run
into
a
few
hands
but
the
worst
of
the
capital
sins
and
you
who
say
it
is
modern
facilities
of
distribution
are
like
men
who
can
not
read
large
print
without
spectacles
or
again
you
are
like
men
who
should
say
that
their
drunkenness
was
due
to
their
drink
or
that
arson
was
caused
by
matches
but
frankly
do
you
suppose
i
came
all
this
way
over
so
many
hills
to
talk
economics
very
far
from
it
i
will
pray
for
all
poor
men
when
i
get
to
st
peter
in
rome
i
should
like
to
know
what
capital
st
peter
had
in
that
highly
capitalistic
first
century
and
meanwhile
do
you
discuss
the
margin
of
production
while
i
go
on
the
open
way
there
are
no
landlords
here
and
if
you
would
learn
at
least
one
foreign
language
and
travel
but
five
miles
off
a
railway
you
you
would
find
how
much
landlordism
has
to
do
with
your
and
your
lector
i
thought
you
said
you
were
not
going
to
talk
economics
auctor
neither
am
i
it
is
but
the
backwash
of
a
wave
well
then
i
went
up
the
open
way
and
came
in
a
few
miles
of
that
hot
afternoon
to
the
second
ridge
of
the
jura
which
they
call
terrible
hill
or
mount
terrible
and
in
truth
it
is
very
jagged
a
steep
long
crest
of
very
many
miles
lies
here
between
the
vale
of
porrentruy
and
the
deep
gorge
of
the
doubs
the
highroad
goes
off
a
long
way
westward
seeking
for
a
pass
or
neck
in
the
chain
but
i
determined
to
find
a
straight
road
across
and
spoke
to
some
who
were
felling
trees
just
where
the
road
began
to
climb
they
gave
me
this
curious
indication
they
said
you
up
this
muddy
track
that
has
been
made
athwart
the
woods
and
over
the
pastures
by
our
sliding
logs
for
they
had
cut
their
trunks
higher
up
the
mountains
you
will
come
to
the
summit
easily
from
thence
you
will
see
the
doubs
running
below
you
in
a
very
deep
and
dark
ravine
i
thanked
them
and
soon
found
that
they
had
told
me
right
there
unmistakable
a
gash
in
the
forest
and
across
the
intervening
fields
of
grass
was
the
run
of
the
timber
when
i
had
climbed
almost
to
the
top
i
looked
behind
me
to
take
my
last
view
of
the
north
i
saw
just
before
me
a
high
isolated
rock
between
me
and
it
was
the
forest
i
saw
beyond
it
the
infinite
plain
of
alsace
and
the
distant
vosges
the
cliff
of
limestone
that
bounded
that
height
fell
sheer
upon
the
its
sublimity
arrested
me
and
compelled
me
to
record
it
i
said
switzerland
has
any
gates
on
the
north
they
are
these
then
having
drawn
the
wonderful
outline
of
what
i
had
seen
i
went
up
panting
to
the
summit
and
resting
there
discovered
beneath
me
the
curious
swirl
of
the
doubs
where
it
ran
in
a
dark
gulf
thousands
of
feet
below
the
shape
of
this
extraordinary
turn
i
will
describe
in
a
moment
let
me
say
meanwhile
that
there
was
no
precipice
or
rock
between
me
and
the
river
only
a
down
down
down
through
other
trees
and
pastures
not
too
steep
for
a
man
to
walk
but
steeper
than
our
steep
downs
and
fells
in
england
where
a
man
hesitates
and
picks
his
way
it
was
so
much
of
a
descent
and
so
long
that
one
looked
above
the
it
was
a
place
where
no
one
would
care
to
ride
i
found
a
kind
of
path
sideways
on
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
followed
it
till
i
came
to
a
platform
with
a
hut
perched
thereon
and
men
building
here
a
good
woman
told
me
just
how
to
go
i
was
not
to
attempt
the
road
to
that
is
farm
as
i
had
first
intended
foolishly
trusting
a
map
but
to
take
a
gully
she
would
show
me
and
follow
it
till
i
reached
the
river
she
came
out
and
led
me
steeply
across
a
hanging
pasture
all
the
while
she
had
knitting
in
her
hands
and
i
noticed
that
on
the
levels
she
went
on
with
her
knitting
then
when
we
got
to
the
gully
she
said
i
had
but
to
follow
it
i
thanked
her
and
she
climbed
up
to
her
home
this
gully
was
the
precipitous
bed
of
a
stream
i
clanked
down
it
thousands
of
feet
warily
i
reached
the
valley
and
at
last
very
gladly
came
to
a
drain
and
thus
knew
that
i
approached
a
town
or
village
it
was
st
ursanne
the
very
first
thing
i
noticed
in
st
ursanne
was
the
extraordinary
shape
of
the
lower
windows
of
the
church
they
lighted
a
crypt
and
ran
along
the
ground
which
in
itself
was
sufficiently
remarkable
but
much
more
remarkable
was
their
shape
which
seemed
to
me
to
approach
that
of
a
horseshoe
i
never
saw
such
a
thing
before
it
looked
as
though
the
weight
of
the
church
above
had
bulged
these
little
windows
out
and
that
is
the
way
i
explain
it
some
people
would
say
it
was
a
man
coming
home
from
the
crusades
that
had
made
them
this
eastern
way
others
that
it
was
a
symbol
of
something
or
other
but
i
say
lector
what
rhodomontade
and
pedantry
is
this
talk
about
the
shape
of
a
window
auctor
little
friend
how
little
you
know
to
a
building
windows
are
everything
they
are
what
eyes
are
to
a
man
out
of
windows
a
building
takes
its
view
in
windows
the
outlook
of
its
human
inhabitants
is
framed
if
you
were
the
lord
of
a
very
high
tower
overlooking
a
town
a
plain
a
river
and
a
distant
hill
i
doubt
if
you
will
ever
have
such
luck
would
you
not
call
your
architect
up
before
you
and
say
see
that
the
windows
of
my
house
are
narrow
and
have
a
top
to
them
of
course
you
would
for
thus
you
would
best
catch
in
separate
pictures
the
sunlit
things
outside
your
home
never
ridicule
windows
it
is
out
of
windows
that
many
fall
to
their
deaths
by
windows
love
often
enters
through
a
window
went
the
bolt
that
killed
king
richard
king
william
father
spied
arlette
from
a
window
i
have
looked
through
it
myself
but
not
a
soul
did
i
see
washing
below
when
a
mob
would
rule
england
it
breaks
windows
and
when
a
patriot
would
save
her
he
taxes
them
out
of
windows
we
walk
on
to
lawns
in
summer
and
meet
men
and
women
and
in
winter
windows
are
drums
for
the
splendid
music
of
storms
that
makes
us
feel
so
masterly
round
our
fires
the
windows
of
the
great
cathedrals
are
all
their
meaning
but
for
windows
we
should
have
to
go
to
see
daylight
after
the
sun
which
they
serve
i
know
of
nothing
so
beneficent
as
windows
fie
upon
the
ungrateful
man
that
has
no
in
his
house
and
thinks
himself
too
great
a
philosopher
to
bow
down
to
windows
may
he
live
in
a
place
without
windows
for
a
while
to
teach
him
the
value
of
windows
as
for
me
i
will
keep
up
the
high
worship
of
windows
till
i
come
to
the
windowless
grave
talk
to
me
of
windows
yes
there
are
other
things
in
st
ursanne
it
is
a
little
tiny
town
and
yet
has
gates
it
is
full
of
very
old
houses
people
and
speech
it
was
founded
or
named
by
a
bear
saint
and
the
statue
of
the
saint
with
his
bear
is
carved
on
the
top
of
a
column
in
the
but
the
chief
thing
about
it
so
it
seemed
to
me
was
its
remoteness
the
gorge
of
the
doubs
of
which
i
said
a
word
or
two
above
is
of
that
very
rare
shape
which
isolates
whatever
may
be
found
in
such
valleys
it
turns
right
back
upon
itself
like
a
very
narrow
u
and
thus
can
not
by
any
possibility
lead
any
one
anywhere
for
though
in
all
times
travellers
have
had
to
follow
river
valleys
yet
when
they
come
to
such
a
long
and
sharp
turn
as
this
they
have
always
cut
across
the
intervening
bend
here
is
the
shape
of
this
valley
with
the
high
hills
round
it
and
in
its
core
which
will
show
better
than
description
what
i
mean
the
little
picture
also
shows
what
the
gorge
looked
like
as
i
came
down
on
it
from
the
heights
above
in
the
map
the
small
white
shows
where
the
railway
bridge
was
and
in
this
map
as
in
the
others
the
dark
is
for
the
depth
and
the
light
is
for
the
heights
as
for
the
picture
it
is
what
one
sees
when
one
is
coming
over
the
ridge
at
the
north
or
top
of
the
map
and
when
one
first
catches
the
river
beneath
one
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
what
the
romans
did
to
get
through
the
mont
terrible
and
how
they
negotiated
this
crook
in
the
doubs
for
they
certainly
passed
into
gaul
through
the
gates
of
porrentruy
and
by
that
obvious
valley
below
it
i
decided
that
they
probably
came
round
eastward
by
delemont
but
for
my
part
i
was
on
a
straight
path
to
rome
and
as
that
line
lay
just
along
the
top
of
the
river
bend
i
was
bound
to
take
it
now
outside
st
ursanne
if
one
would
go
along
the
top
of
the
river
bend
and
so
up
to
the
other
side
of
the
gorge
is
a
kind
of
subsidiary
ravine
awful
deep
and
narrow
and
this
was
crossed
i
could
see
by
a
very
high
railway
bridge
not
suspecting
any
evil
and
desiring
to
avoid
the
long
descent
into
the
ravine
the
looking
for
a
bridge
or
ford
and
the
steep
climb
up
the
other
side
i
made
in
my
folly
for
the
station
which
stood
just
where
the
railway
left
solid
ground
to
go
over
this
high
high
bridge
i
asked
leave
of
the
stationmaster
to
cross
it
who
said
it
was
strictly
forbidden
but
that
he
was
not
a
policeman
and
that
i
might
do
it
at
my
own
risk
thanking
him
therefore
and
considering
how
charming
was
the
loose
habit
of
small
uncentralized
societies
i
went
merrily
on
to
the
bridge
meaning
to
walk
across
it
by
stepping
from
sleeper
to
sleeper
but
it
was
not
to
be
so
simple
the
powers
of
the
air
that
hate
to
have
their
kingdom
disturbed
watched
me
as
i
began
i
had
not
been
engaged
upon
it
a
dozen
yards
when
i
was
seized
with
terror
i
have
much
to
say
further
on
in
this
book
concerning
terror
the
panic
that
haunts
high
places
and
the
spell
of
many
angry
men
this
horrible
affection
of
the
mind
is
the
delight
of
our
modern
scribblers
it
is
half
the
plot
of
their
insane
stories
and
is
at
the
root
of
their
worship
of
what
they
call
a
cowardly
craving
for
protection
or
the
much
more
despicable
fascination
of
brutality
for
my
part
i
have
always
disregarded
it
as
something
impure
and
devilish
unworthy
of
a
christian
fear
i
think
indeed
to
be
in
the
nature
of
things
and
it
is
as
much
part
of
my
experience
to
be
afraid
of
the
sea
or
of
an
untried
horse
as
it
is
to
eat
and
sleep
but
terror
which
is
a
sudden
madness
and
paralysis
of
the
soul
that
i
say
is
from
hell
and
not
to
be
played
with
or
considered
or
put
in
pictures
or
described
in
stories
all
this
i
say
to
preface
what
happened
and
especially
to
point
out
how
terror
is
in
the
nature
of
a
possession
and
is
unreasonable
for
in
the
crossing
of
this
bridge
there
was
nothing
in
itself
perilous
the
sleepers
lay
very
close
together
i
doubt
if
a
man
could
have
slipped
between
them
but
i
know
not
how
many
hundred
feet
below
was
the
flashing
of
the
torrent
and
it
turned
my
brain
for
the
only
parapet
there
was
a
light
line
or
pipe
quite
slender
and
low
down
running
from
one
spare
iron
upright
to
another
these
rather
emphasized
than
encouraged
my
mood
and
still
as
i
resolutely
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
and
resolutely
kept
my
eyes
off
the
abyss
and
fixed
on
the
opposing
hill
and
as
the
long
curve
before
me
was
diminished
by
successive
sharp
advances
still
my
heart
was
caught
in
every
breath
and
whatever
it
is
that
moves
a
man
went
uncertainly
within
me
mechanical
and
the
great
height
with
that
narrow
unprotected
ribbon
across
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
dared
not
turn
round
and
i
dared
not
stop
words
and
phrases
began
repeating
themselves
in
my
head
as
they
will
under
a
strain
so
i
know
at
sea
a
man
perilously
hanging
on
to
the
tiller
makes
a
kind
of
litany
of
his
instructions
the
central
part
was
passed
the
the
tension
of
that
enduring
effort
had
grown
intolerable
and
i
doubted
my
ability
to
complete
the
task
why
what
could
prevent
me
i
can
not
say
it
was
all
a
bundle
of
imaginaries
perhaps
at
bottom
what
i
feared
was
sudden
giddiness
and
the
fall
at
any
rate
at
this
last
supreme
part
i
vowed
one
candle
to
our
lady
of
perpetual
succour
if
she
would
see
that
all
went
well
and
this
candle
i
later
paid
in
rome
finding
our
lady
of
succour
not
hung
up
in
a
public
place
and
known
to
all
as
i
thought
she
would
be
but
peculiar
to
a
little
church
belonging
to
a
scotchman
and
standing
above
his
high
altar
yet
it
is
a
very
famous
picture
and
extremely
old
well
then
having
made
this
vow
i
still
went
on
with
panic
aiding
me
till
i
saw
that
the
bank
beneath
had
risen
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
bridge
and
that
dry
land
was
not
twenty
yards
away
then
my
resolution
left
me
and
i
ran
or
rather
stumbled
rapidly
from
sleeper
to
sleeper
till
i
could
take
a
deep
breath
on
the
solid
earth
beyond
i
stood
and
gazed
back
over
the
abyss
i
saw
the
little
horrible
strip
between
heaven
and
hell
the
perspective
of
its
rails
i
was
made
ill
by
the
relief
from
terror
yet
i
suppose
cross
and
recross
it
twenty
times
a
day
better
for
them
than
for
me
there
is
the
story
of
the
awful
bridge
of
the
mont
terrible
and
it
lies
to
a
yard
upon
the
straight
line
the
segment
of
the
great
circle
uniting
toul
and
rome
the
high
bank
or
hillside
before
me
was
that
which
ends
the
gorge
of
the
doubs
and
looks
down
either
limb
of
the
sharp
bend
i
had
here
not
to
climb
but
to
follow
at
one
height
round
the
curve
my
way
ran
by
a
rather
lane
and
passed
a
village
then
it
was
my
business
to
make
straight
up
the
farther
wall
of
the
gorge
and
as
there
was
wood
upon
this
it
looked
an
easy
matter
but
when
i
came
to
it
it
was
not
easy
the
wood
grew
in
loose
rocks
and
the
slope
was
much
too
steep
for
anything
but
hands
and
knees
and
far
too
soft
and
broken
for
true
climbing
and
no
wonder
this
ridge
seemed
a
wall
for
steepness
and
difficulty
since
it
was
the
watershed
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
cold
north
sea
but
i
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
it
must
have
taken
me
close
on
an
hour
before
i
had
covered
the
last
thousand
feet
or
so
that
brought
me
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
there
to
my
great
astonishment
was
a
road
where
could
such
a
road
lead
and
why
did
it
follow
right
along
the
highest
edge
of
the
mountains
the
jura
with
their
unique
parallels
provide
twenty
such
problems
wherever
it
led
however
this
road
was
plainly
perpendicular
to
my
true
route
and
i
had
but
to
press
on
my
straight
line
so
i
crossed
it
saw
for
a
last
time
through
the
trees
the
gorge
of
the
doubs
and
then
got
upon
a
path
which
led
down
through
a
field
more
or
less
in
the
direction
of
my
pilgrimage
here
the
country
was
so
broken
that
one
could
make
out
but
little
of
its
general
features
but
of
course
on
the
whole
i
was
following
down
yet
another
southern
slope
the
southern
slope
of
the
chain
of
the
jura
when
after
passing
through
many
glades
and
along
a
stony
path
i
found
a
kind
of
gate
between
two
high
rocks
and
emerged
somewhat
suddenly
upon
a
wide
down
studded
with
old
trees
and
also
many
stunted
yews
and
this
sank
down
to
a
noble
valley
which
lay
all
before
me
the
open
down
or
prairie
on
which
i
stood
i
afterwards
found
to
be
called
the
of
common
right
a
very
fine
name
and
as
a
gallery
will
command
a
great
hall
so
this
field
like
a
platform
commanded
the
wide
and
fading
valley
below
it
was
a
very
glad
surprise
to
see
this
sight
suddenly
unrolled
as
i
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
down
the
jura
had
hitherto
been
either
lonely
or
somewhat
awful
or
naked
and
rocky
but
here
was
a
true
vale
in
which
one
could
imagine
a
spirit
of
its
own
there
were
corn
lands
and
no
rocks
the
mountains
on
either
side
did
not
rise
so
high
as
three
thousand
feet
though
of
limestone
they
were
rounded
in
form
and
the
slanting
sun
of
the
late
afternoon
all
the
storm
had
left
the
sky
took
them
full
and
warm
the
valley
remaining
wide
and
fruitful
went
on
out
eastward
till
the
hills
became
mixed
up
with
brume
and
distance
as
i
did
not
know
its
name
i
called
it
after
the
village
immediately
below
me
for
which
i
was
making
and
i
still
remember
it
as
the
valley
of
glovelier
and
it
lies
between
the
third
and
fourth
ridges
of
the
jura
before
leaving
the
field
i
drew
what
i
saw
but
i
was
much
too
tired
by
the
double
and
prodigious
climb
of
the
past
hours
to
draw
definitely
or
clearly
such
as
it
is
there
it
is
then
i
went
down
over
the
smooth
field
there
is
something
that
distinguishes
the
rugged
from
the
gracious
in
landscape
and
in
our
europe
this
something
corresponds
to
the
use
and
presence
of
men
especially
in
mountainous
places
for
men
habits
and
civilization
fill
the
valleys
and
wash
up
the
base
of
the
hills
making
as
it
were
a
tide
mark
into
this
zone
i
had
already
passed
the
turf
was
trodden
fine
and
was
set
firm
as
it
can
only
become
by
thousands
of
years
of
pasturing
the
moisture
that
oozed
out
of
the
earth
was
not
the
random
bog
of
the
high
places
but
a
human
spring
caught
in
a
stone
trough
attention
had
been
given
to
the
trees
below
me
stood
a
wall
which
though
rough
was
not
the
haphazard
thing
men
pile
up
in
the
last
recesses
of
the
hills
but
formed
of
chosen
stones
and
these
bound
together
with
mortar
on
my
right
was
a
deep
little
dale
with
children
playing
in
it
and
this
i
afterwards
learned
was
called
a
delightful
memory
all
our
deeper
hollows
are
called
the
same
at
home
and
even
the
welsh
have
the
word
but
they
spell
it
it
is
their
mountain
way
well
as
i
was
saying
everything
surrounding
me
was
domestic
and
grateful
and
i
was
therefore
in
a
mood
for
charity
and
companionship
when
i
came
down
the
last
dip
and
entered
glovelier
but
glovelier
is
a
place
of
no
excellence
whatever
and
if
the
thought
did
not
seem
extravagant
i
should
be
for
putting
it
to
the
sword
and
burning
it
all
down
for
just
as
i
was
going
along
full
of
kindly
thoughts
and
had
turned
into
the
sign
of
i
think
it
was
the
to
drink
wine
and
leave
them
my
benediction
lector
why
your
benediction
auctor
who
else
can
give
benedictions
if
people
can
not
when
they
are
on
pilgrimage
learn
that
there
are
three
avenues
by
which
blessing
can
be
bestowed
and
three
kinds
of
men
who
can
bestow
it
there
is
the
good
man
whose
goodness
makes
him
of
himself
a
giver
of
blessings
his
power
is
not
conferred
or
of
office
but
is
part
of
the
stuff
of
his
mind
this
kind
can
confer
the
solemn
benediction
or
if
they
choose
but
besides
this
their
every
kind
thought
word
or
action
is
a
and
even
their
frowns
curses
angry
looks
and
irritable
gestures
may
be
called
minores
vel
i
believe
i
am
within
the
definitions
i
avoid
heresy
all
this
is
sound
theology
i
do
not
smell
of
the
faggot
and
this
kind
of
benedictory
power
is
the
fount
or
type
or
natural
origin
as
it
were
of
all
others
there
is
the
official
of
religion
who
in
the
exercise
of
his
office
lector
for
heaven
sake
auctor
who
began
it
you
protested
my
power
to
give
benediction
and
i
must
now
prove
it
at
length
otherwise
i
should
fall
under
the
accusation
of
lesser
simony
that
is
the
false
assumption
of
particular
powers
well
then
there
is
the
official
who
and
when
he
makes
it
quite
clear
that
it
is
and
not
ut
can
give
formal
benediction
this
power
belongs
certainly
to
all
bishops
mitred
abbots
and
archimandrates
to
patriarchs
of
course
and
to
the
pope
in
rome
they
will
have
it
that
monsignores
also
can
so
bless
and
i
have
heard
it
debated
whether
or
no
the
same
were
not
true
in
some
rustic
way
of
parish
priests
however
this
may
be
all
their
power
proceeds
not
from
themselves
but
from
the
accumulation
of
goodness
left
as
a
deposit
by
the
multitudes
of
exceptionally
good
men
who
have
lived
in
times
past
and
who
have
now
no
use
for
it
thirdly
and
this
is
my
point
any
one
good
or
bad
official
or
who
is
for
the
moment
engaged
in
an
can
act
certainly
as
a
conductor
or
medium
and
the
influence
of
what
he
is
touching
or
doing
passes
to
you
from
him
this
is
admitted
by
every
one
who
worships
trees
wells
and
stones
and
indeed
it
stands
to
reason
for
it
is
but
a
branch
of
the
ex
loco
opere
tactu
vel
conditione
i
will
admit
that
this
power
is
but
vague
slight
tenuous
and
dissipatory
still
there
it
is
though
of
course
its
poor
effect
is
to
that
of
the
what
a
in
the
solent
is
to
a
snorter
on
lindsey
deeps
i
am
sorry
to
have
been
at
such
length
but
it
is
necessary
to
have
these
things
thrashed
out
once
for
all
so
now
you
see
how
i
being
on
pilgrimage
could
give
a
kind
of
little
creeping
blessing
to
the
people
on
the
way
though
as
st
louis
said
to
the
it
be
a
long
time
before
you
can
kiss
my
bones
so
i
entered
the
inn
and
saw
there
a
woman
sewing
a
great
man
like
an
ox
and
a
youth
writing
down
figures
in
a
little
book
i
said
morning
madam
and
sirs
and
the
company
could
you
give
me
a
little
red
wine
not
a
head
moved
true
i
was
very
dirty
and
tired
and
they
may
have
thought
me
a
beggar
to
whom
like
good
sensible
christians
who
had
no
nonsense
about
them
they
would
rather
have
given
a
handsome
kick
than
a
cup
of
cold
water
however
i
think
it
was
not
only
my
poverty
but
a
native
churlishness
which
bound
their
bovine
souls
in
that
valley
i
sat
down
at
a
very
clean
table
i
notice
that
those
whom
the
devil
has
made
his
own
are
always
spick
and
span
just
as
firemen
who
have
to
go
into
great
furnaces
have
to
keep
all
their
gear
highly
polished
i
sat
down
at
it
and
said
again
still
gently
is
indeed
a
fine
country
this
of
yours
could
you
give
me
a
little
red
wine
then
the
man
who
had
his
back
turned
to
me
and
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
said
sulkily
not
to
me
but
to
the
woman
wants
wine
the
woman
as
sulkily
said
to
me
not
looking
me
in
the
eyes
much
will
you
pay
i
said
the
wine
set
it
here
see
me
drink
it
charge
me
your
due
i
found
that
this
brutal
way
of
speaking
was
just
what
was
needed
for
the
kine
and
cattle
of
this
pen
she
skipped
off
to
a
cupboard
and
set
wine
before
me
and
a
glass
i
drank
quite
quietly
till
i
had
had
enough
and
asked
what
there
was
to
pay
she
said
and
i
said
much
as
i
paid
it
at
this
the
man
grunted
and
frowned
and
i
was
afraid
but
hiding
my
fear
i
walked
out
boldly
and
slowly
and
made
a
noise
with
my
stick
upon
the
floor
of
the
hall
without
neither
did
i
bid
them
farewell
but
i
made
a
sign
at
the
house
as
i
left
it
whether
it
suffered
from
this
as
did
the
house
at
dorchester
which
the
man
in
the
boat
caused
to
wither
in
one
night
is
more
than
i
can
tell
the
road
led
straight
across
the
valley
and
approached
the
further
wall
of
hills
these
i
saw
were
pierced
by
one
of
the
curious
gaps
which
are
peculiar
to
limestone
ranges
water
cuts
them
and
a
torrent
ran
through
this
one
also
the
road
through
it
gap
though
it
was
went
up
steeply
and
the
further
valley
was
evidently
higher
than
the
one
i
was
leaving
it
was
already
evening
as
i
entered
this
narrow
ravine
the
sun
only
caught
the
tops
of
the
my
fatigue
was
very
great
and
my
walking
painful
to
an
extreme
when
having
come
to
a
place
where
the
gorge
was
narrowest
and
where
the
two
sides
were
like
the
posts
of
a
giant
stile
where
also
the
fifth
ridge
of
the
jura
stood
up
beyond
me
in
the
further
valley
a
vast
shadow
i
sat
down
wearily
and
drew
what
not
even
my
exhaustion
could
render
unremarkable
while
i
was
occupied
sketching
the
slabs
of
limestone
i
heard
wheels
coming
up
behind
me
and
a
boy
in
a
waggon
stopped
and
hailed
me
what
the
boy
wanted
to
know
was
whether
i
would
take
a
lift
and
this
he
said
in
such
curious
french
that
i
shuddered
to
think
how
far
i
had
pierced
into
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
how
soon
i
might
come
to
quite
strange
people
i
was
greatly
tempted
to
get
into
his
cart
but
though
i
had
broken
so
many
of
my
vows
one
remained
yet
whole
and
sound
which
was
that
i
would
ride
upon
no
wheeled
thing
remembering
this
therefore
and
considering
that
the
faith
is
rich
in
interpretation
i
clung
on
to
the
waggon
in
such
a
manner
that
it
did
all
my
work
for
me
and
yet
could
not
be
said
to
be
actually
carrying
me
the
essence
of
a
vow
is
its
literal
meaning
the
spirit
and
intention
are
for
the
major
morality
and
concern
natural
religion
but
when
upon
a
point
of
ritual
or
of
dedication
or
special
worship
a
man
talks
to
you
of
the
spirit
and
intention
and
complains
of
the
dryness
of
the
word
look
at
him
askance
he
is
not
far
removed
from
heresy
i
knew
a
man
once
that
was
given
to
drinking
and
i
made
up
this
rule
for
him
to
distinguish
between
bacchus
and
the
devil
to
wit
that
he
should
never
drink
what
has
been
made
and
sold
since
the
reformation
i
mean
especially
spirits
and
champagne
let
him
said
i
drink
red
wine
and
white
good
beer
and
mead
if
he
could
get
it
liqueurs
made
by
monks
and
in
a
word
all
those
feeding
fortifying
and
confirming
beverages
that
our
fathers
drank
in
old
time
but
not
whisky
nor
brandy
nor
sparkling
wines
not
absinthe
nor
the
kind
of
drink
called
gin
this
he
promised
to
do
and
all
went
well
he
became
a
merry
companion
and
began
to
write
odes
his
prose
clarified
and
set
that
had
before
been
very
mixed
and
cloudy
he
slept
well
he
comprehended
divine
things
he
was
already
half
a
republican
when
one
fatal
day
it
was
the
feast
of
the
eleven
thousand
virgins
and
they
were
too
busy
up
in
heaven
to
consider
the
needs
of
us
poor
hobbling
polyktonous
and
betempted
wretches
of
men
i
went
with
him
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
annoyances
to
the
rich
where
a
certain
usurer
son
was
to
read
a
paper
on
the
cruelty
of
spaniards
to
their
mules
as
we
were
all
seated
there
round
a
table
with
a
staring
green
cloth
on
it
and
a
damnable
gas
pendant
above
the
host
of
that
evening
offered
him
whisky
and
water
and
my
back
being
turned
he
took
it
then
when
i
would
have
taken
it
from
him
he
used
these
words
all
it
is
the
intention
of
a
pledge
that
matters
and
i
saw
that
all
was
over
for
he
had
abandoned
definition
and
was
plunged
back
into
the
horrible
mazes
of
conscience
and
natural
religion
what
do
you
think
then
was
the
consequence
why
he
had
to
take
some
nasty
pledge
or
other
to
drink
nothing
whatever
and
become
a
spectacle
and
a
judgement
whereas
if
he
had
kept
his
exact
word
he
might
by
this
time
have
been
a
happy
man
remembering
him
and
pondering
upon
the
advantage
of
strict
rule
i
hung
on
to
my
cart
taking
care
to
let
my
feet
still
feel
the
road
and
so
passed
through
the
high
limestone
gates
of
the
gorge
and
was
in
the
fourth
valley
of
the
jura
with
the
fifth
ridge
standing
up
black
and
huge
before
me
against
the
last
of
the
daylight
there
were
as
yet
no
stars
there
in
this
silent
place
was
the
little
village
of
undervelier
and
i
thanked
the
boy
withdrew
from
his
cart
and
painfully
approached
the
inn
where
i
asked
the
woman
if
she
could
give
me
something
to
eat
and
she
said
that
she
could
in
about
an
hour
using
however
with
regard
to
what
it
was
i
was
to
have
words
which
i
did
not
understand
for
the
french
had
become
quite
barbaric
and
i
was
now
indeed
lost
in
one
of
the
inner
places
of
the
world
a
cigar
is
however
even
in
undervelier
a
cigar
and
the
best
cost
a
penny
one
of
these
therefore
i
bought
and
then
i
went
out
smoking
it
into
the
village
square
and
finding
a
low
wall
leaned
over
it
and
contemplated
the
glorious
clear
green
water
tumbling
and
roaring
along
beneath
it
on
the
other
side
for
a
little
river
ran
through
the
village
as
i
leaned
there
resting
and
communing
i
noticed
how
their
church
close
at
hand
was
built
along
the
low
banks
of
the
torrent
i
admired
the
luxuriance
of
the
grass
these
waters
fed
and
the
generous
arch
of
the
trees
beside
it
the
graves
seemed
set
in
a
natural
place
of
rest
and
home
and
just
beyond
this
churchyard
was
that
marriage
of
hewn
stone
and
water
which
is
the
source
of
so
peculiar
a
satisfaction
for
the
church
tower
was
built
boldly
right
out
into
the
stream
and
the
current
went
eddying
round
it
but
why
it
is
that
strong
human
building
when
it
dips
into
water
should
thus
affect
the
mind
i
can
not
say
only
i
know
that
it
is
an
emotion
apart
to
see
our
device
and
structure
where
it
is
most
enduring
come
up
against
and
challenge
that
element
which
we
can
not
conquer
and
which
has
always
in
it
something
of
danger
for
men
it
is
therefore
well
to
put
strong
mouldings
on
to
piers
and
quays
and
to
make
an
architecture
of
them
and
so
it
was
a
splendid
thought
of
the
romans
to
build
their
villas
right
out
to
sea
so
they
say
does
venice
enthrall
one
but
where
i
have
most
noticed
this
thing
is
at
the
mont
st
michel
only
one
must
take
care
to
shut
one
eyes
or
sleep
during
all
the
low
tide
as
i
was
watching
that
stream
against
those
old
stones
my
cigar
being
now
half
smoked
a
bell
began
tolling
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
village
were
pouring
into
the
church
at
this
i
was
very
much
surprised
not
having
been
used
at
any
time
of
my
life
to
the
unanimous
devotion
of
an
entire
population
but
having
always
thought
of
the
faith
as
something
fighting
odds
and
having
seen
unanimity
only
in
places
where
some
sham
religion
or
other
glozed
over
our
tragedies
and
excused
our
sins
certainly
to
see
all
the
men
women
and
children
of
a
place
taking
catholicism
for
granted
was
a
new
sight
and
so
i
put
my
cigar
carefully
down
under
a
stone
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
went
in
with
them
i
then
saw
that
what
they
were
at
was
vespers
all
the
village
sang
knowing
the
psalms
very
well
and
i
noticed
that
their
latin
was
nearer
german
than
french
but
what
was
most
pleasing
of
all
was
to
hear
from
all
the
men
and
women
together
that
very
noble
and
salutation
to
god
which
begins
lucis
ante
my
whole
mind
was
taken
up
and
transfigured
by
this
collective
act
and
i
saw
for
a
moment
the
catholic
church
quite
plain
and
i
remembered
europe
and
the
centuries
then
there
left
me
altogether
that
attitude
of
difficulty
and
combat
which
for
us
others
is
always
associated
with
the
faith
the
cities
dwindled
in
my
imagination
and
i
took
less
heed
of
the
modern
noise
i
went
out
with
them
into
the
clear
evening
and
the
cool
i
found
my
cigar
and
lit
it
again
and
musing
much
more
deeply
than
before
not
without
tears
i
considered
the
nature
of
belief
of
its
nature
it
breeds
a
reaction
and
an
indifference
those
who
believe
nothing
but
only
think
and
judge
can
not
understand
this
of
its
nature
it
struggles
with
us
and
we
we
when
our
youth
is
full
on
us
invariably
reject
it
and
set
out
in
the
sunlight
content
with
natural
things
then
for
a
long
time
we
are
like
men
who
follow
down
the
cleft
of
a
mountain
and
the
peaks
are
hidden
from
us
and
forgotten
it
takes
years
to
reach
the
dry
plain
and
then
we
look
back
and
see
our
home
what
is
it
do
you
think
that
causes
the
return
i
think
it
is
the
problem
of
living
for
every
day
every
experience
of
evil
demands
a
solution
that
solution
is
provided
by
the
memory
of
the
great
scheme
which
at
last
we
remember
our
childhood
pierces
through
again
but
i
will
not
attempt
to
explain
it
for
i
have
not
the
power
only
i
know
that
we
who
return
suffer
hard
things
for
there
grows
a
gulf
between
us
and
many
companions
we
are
perpetually
thrust
into
minorities
and
the
world
almost
begins
to
talk
a
strange
language
we
are
troubled
by
the
human
machinery
of
a
perfect
and
superhuman
revelation
we
are
for
its
safety
alarmed
and
in
danger
of
violent
decisions
and
this
is
hard
that
the
faith
begins
to
make
one
abandon
the
old
way
of
judging
averages
and
movements
and
the
rest
grow
uncertain
we
see
things
from
within
and
consider
one
mind
or
a
little
group
as
a
salt
or
leaven
the
very
nature
of
social
force
seems
changed
to
us
and
this
is
hard
when
a
man
has
loved
common
views
and
is
happy
only
with
his
fellows
and
this
again
is
very
hard
that
we
must
once
more
take
up
that
awful
struggle
to
reconcile
two
truths
and
to
keep
civic
freedom
sacred
in
spite
of
the
organization
of
religion
and
not
to
deny
what
is
certainly
true
it
is
hard
to
accept
mysteries
and
to
be
humble
we
are
tost
as
the
great
schoolmen
were
tost
and
we
dare
not
neglect
the
duty
of
that
wrestling
but
the
hardest
thing
of
all
is
that
it
leads
us
away
as
by
a
command
from
all
that
banquet
of
the
intellect
than
which
there
is
no
keener
joy
known
to
man
i
went
slowly
up
the
village
place
in
the
dusk
thinking
of
this
deplorable
weakness
in
men
that
the
faith
is
too
great
for
them
and
accepting
it
as
an
inevitable
burden
i
continued
to
muse
with
my
eyes
upon
the
ground
there
was
to
be
no
more
of
that
studious
content
that
security
in
historic
analysis
and
that
constant
satisfaction
of
an
appetite
which
never
cloyed
a
wisdom
more
imperative
and
more
profound
was
to
put
a
term
to
the
comfortable
wisdom
of
learning
all
the
balance
of
judgement
the
easy
slow
convictions
the
broad
grasp
of
things
the
vision
of
their
complexity
the
pleasure
in
their
innumerable
life
all
that
had
to
be
given
up
fanaticisms
were
no
longer
entirely
to
be
despised
just
appreciations
and
a
strong
grasp
of
reality
no
longer
entirely
to
be
admired
the
catholic
church
will
have
no
philosophies
she
will
permit
no
comforts
the
cry
of
the
martyrs
is
in
her
far
voice
her
eyes
that
see
beyond
the
world
present
us
heaven
and
hell
to
the
confusion
of
our
human
reconciliations
our
happy
blending
of
good
and
evil
things
by
the
lord
i
begin
to
think
this
intimate
religion
as
tragic
as
a
great
love
there
came
back
into
my
mind
a
relic
that
i
have
in
my
house
it
is
a
panel
of
the
old
door
of
my
college
having
carved
on
it
my
college
arms
i
remembered
the
lion
and
the
shield
fuit
haec
almae
janua
sacra
yes
certainly
religion
is
as
tragic
as
first
love
and
drags
us
out
into
the
void
away
from
our
dear
homes
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
loved
one
woman
from
a
child
and
it
is
a
good
thing
not
to
have
to
return
to
the
faith
they
cook
worse
in
undervelier
than
any
place
i
was
ever
in
with
the
possible
exception
of
omaha
neb
lector
why
do
you
use
phrases
like
exception
auctor
why
not
i
see
that
all
the
religion
i
have
stuck
into
the
book
has
no
more
effect
on
you
than
had
rousseau
upon
sir
henry
maine
you
are
as
full
of
pride
as
a
minor
devil
you
would
avoid
the
and
the
commonplace
and
the
toute
why
not
because
you
naturally
write
odd
prose
contrariwise
left
to
yourself
you
write
pure
journalese
but
simply
because
you
are
swelled
and
puffed
up
with
a
desire
to
pose
you
want
what
the
martha
brown
school
calls
in
prose
my
little
friend
i
know
how
it
is
done
and
i
find
it
contemptible
people
write
their
articles
at
full
speed
putting
down
their
unstudied
and
valueless
conclusions
in
english
as
pale
as
a
film
of
dirty
wax
sometimes
even
they
dictate
to
a
typewriter
then
they
sit
over
it
with
a
blue
pencil
and
carefully
transpose
the
split
infinitives
and
write
alternative
adjectives
and
take
words
away
out
of
their
natural
place
in
the
sentence
and
generally
put
the
queen
english
yes
the
queen
english
on
the
rack
and
who
is
a
penny
the
better
for
it
the
silly
authors
get
no
real
praise
not
even
in
the
horrible
stucco
villas
where
their
clique
meet
on
sundays
the
poor
public
buys
the
and
gasps
at
the
cleverness
of
the
writing
and
despairs
and
has
to
read
what
it
can
understand
and
is
driven
back
to
toshy
novels
about
problems
written
by
cooks
hungry
sheep
as
some
one
says
somewhere
up
and
are
not
fed
and
the
same
poet
well
describes
your
pipings
as
being
on
wretched
straw
pipes
that
are
a
good
word
oh
for
one
man
who
should
write
healthy
hearty
straightforward
english
oh
for
cobbett
there
are
indeed
some
great
men
who
write
twistedly
simply
because
they
can
not
help
it
but
honesty
is
proved
by
the
mass
they
turn
out
what
do
you
turn
out
you
higglers
and
sticklers
perhaps
a
bad
triolet
every
six
months
and
a
book
of
criticism
on
something
thoroughly
threadbare
once
in
five
years
if
i
had
my
way
lector
i
am
sorry
to
have
provoked
all
this
auctor
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
trust
i
have
made
myself
clear
well
as
i
was
saying
they
cook
worse
at
undervelier
than
any
place
i
was
ever
in
with
the
possible
exception
of
omaha
neb
however
i
forgave
them
because
they
were
such
good
people
and
after
a
short
and
bitter
night
i
went
out
in
the
morning
before
the
sun
rose
and
took
the
moutier
road
the
valley
in
which
i
was
now
engaged
the
phrase
seems
familiar
was
more
or
less
like
an
that
is
there
were
two
high
parallel
ranges
bounding
it
but
across
the
middle
a
low
ridge
of
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
the
road
slowly
climbed
this
ridge
through
pastures
where
cows
with
bells
were
rising
from
the
dew
on
the
grass
and
where
one
or
two
little
cottages
and
a
village
already
sent
up
smoke
all
the
way
up
i
was
thinking
of
the
surfeit
of
religion
i
had
had
the
night
before
and
also
of
how
i
had
started
that
morning
without
bread
or
coffee
which
was
a
folly
when
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
there
was
a
young
man
chopping
wood
outside
a
house
and
i
asked
him
in
french
how
far
it
was
to
moutier
he
answered
in
german
and
i
startled
him
by
a
loud
cry
such
as
sailors
give
when
they
see
land
for
at
last
i
had
struck
the
boundary
of
the
languages
and
was
with
pure
foreigners
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
also
asked
him
for
coffee
and
as
he
refused
it
i
took
him
to
be
a
heretic
and
went
down
the
road
making
up
verses
against
all
such
and
singing
them
loudly
through
the
forest
that
now
arched
over
me
and
grew
deeper
as
i
descended
and
my
first
verse
was
heretics
all
whoever
you
be
in
tarbes
or
nimes
or
over
the
sea
you
never
shall
have
good
words
from
me
non
conturbat
if
you
ask
me
why
i
put
a
latin
line
at
the
end
it
was
because
i
had
to
show
that
it
was
a
song
connected
with
the
universal
fountain
and
with
european
culture
and
with
all
that
heresy
combats
i
sang
it
to
a
lively
that
i
had
invented
for
the
occasion
i
then
thought
what
a
fine
fellow
i
was
and
how
pleasant
were
my
friends
when
i
agreed
with
them
i
made
up
this
second
verse
which
i
sang
even
more
loudly
than
the
first
and
the
forest
grew
deeper
sending
back
echoes
but
catholic
men
that
live
upon
wine
are
deep
in
the
water
and
frank
and
fine
wherever
i
travel
i
find
it
so
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
if
one
is
really
doing
a
catholic
work
and
expressing
one
attitude
to
the
world
charity
pity
and
a
great
sense
of
fear
should
possess
one
or
at
least
appear
so
i
made
up
this
third
verse
and
sang
it
to
suit
on
childing
women
that
are
forlorn
and
men
that
sweat
in
nothing
but
scorn
that
is
on
all
that
ever
were
born
then
as
everything
ends
in
death
and
as
that
is
just
what
heretics
least
like
to
be
reminded
of
i
ended
thus
to
my
poor
self
on
my
deathbed
and
all
my
dear
companions
dead
because
of
the
love
that
i
bore
them
eis
i
say
ended
but
i
did
not
really
end
there
for
i
also
wrote
in
the
spirit
of
the
rest
a
verse
of
mea
culpa
and
confession
of
sin
but
i
shall
not
print
it
here
so
my
song
over
and
the
woods
now
left
behind
i
passed
up
a
dusty
piece
of
road
into
moutier
a
detestable
town
all
whitewashed
and
orderly
down
under
the
hills
i
was
tired
for
the
sun
was
now
long
risen
and
somewhat
warm
and
i
had
walked
ten
miles
and
that
over
a
high
ridge
and
i
had
written
a
canticle
and
sung
it
and
all
that
without
a
sup
or
a
bite
i
therefore
took
bread
coffee
and
soup
in
moutier
and
then
going
a
little
way
out
of
the
town
i
crossed
a
stream
off
the
road
climbed
a
knoll
and
lying
under
a
tree
i
slept
i
awoke
and
took
the
road
the
road
after
moutier
was
not
a
thing
for
lyrics
it
stirred
me
in
no
way
it
was
bare
in
the
sunlight
had
fields
on
either
side
and
in
the
fields
stood
houses
in
the
houses
were
mortal
men
there
is
a
school
of
poets
i
can
not
read
them
myself
who
treat
of
common
things
and
their
admirers
tell
us
that
these
men
raise
the
things
of
everyday
life
to
the
plane
of
the
supernatural
note
that
phrase
for
it
is
a
shaft
of
light
through
a
cloud
revealing
their
disgusting
minds
everyday
life
as
said
in
a
famous
leading
article
presse
pooh
i
know
that
everyday
life
it
goes
with
sandals
and
pictures
of
lean
ugly
people
all
just
like
one
another
in
browny
photographs
on
the
wall
and
these
pictures
are
called
one
house
of
life
or
another
place
beautiful
or
yet
again
a
third
lamp
of
the
valley
and
when
you
complain
and
shift
about
uneasily
before
these
pictures
the
and
owners
of
them
tell
you
that
of
course
in
photographs
you
lose
the
marvellous
colour
of
the
original
this
everyday
life
has
mantelpieces
made
of
the
same
stuff
as
so
that
by
instinct
i
try
to
make
rings
on
them
with
my
and
the
people
who
suffer
this
life
get
up
every
morning
at
eight
and
the
poor
sad
men
of
the
house
slave
at
wretched
articles
and
come
home
to
hear
more
literature
and
more
appreciations
and
the
unholy
women
do
nothing
and
attend
to
local
government
that
is
the
oppression
of
the
poor
and
altogether
this
accursed
everyday
life
of
theirs
is
instinct
with
the
four
sins
crying
to
heaven
for
vengeance
and
there
is
no
humanity
in
it
and
no
simplicity
and
no
recollection
i
know
whole
quarters
of
the
towns
of
that
life
where
they
have
never
heard
of
virtus
or
verecundia
or
pietas
lector
then
auctor
alas
alas
dear
lector
in
these
houses
there
is
no
honest
dust
not
a
bottle
of
good
wine
or
bad
no
prints
inherited
from
one
uncle
and
no
children
books
by
mrs
barbauld
or
miss
edgeworth
no
human
disorder
nothing
of
that
organic
comfort
which
makes
a
man
house
like
a
bear
fur
for
him
they
have
no
debts
they
do
not
read
in
bed
and
they
will
have
difficulty
in
saving
their
souls
lector
then
tell
me
how
would
you
treat
of
common
things
auctor
why
i
would
leave
them
alone
but
if
i
had
to
treat
of
them
i
will
show
you
how
i
would
do
it
let
us
have
a
dialogue
about
this
road
from
moutier
lector
by
all
means
auctor
what
a
terrible
thing
it
is
to
miss
one
sleep
i
can
hardly
bear
the
heat
of
the
road
and
my
mind
is
empty
lector
why
you
have
just
slept
in
a
wood
auctor
yes
but
that
is
not
enough
one
must
sleep
at
night
lector
my
brother
often
complains
of
insomnia
he
is
a
policeman
auctor
indeed
it
is
a
sad
affliction
lector
yes
indeed
auctor
indeed
yes
lector
i
can
not
go
on
like
this
auctor
there
that
is
just
what
i
was
saying
one
can
not
treat
of
common
things
it
is
not
literature
and
for
my
part
if
i
were
the
editor
even
of
a
magazine
and
the
author
stuck
in
a
string
of
dialogue
i
would
not
pay
him
by
the
page
but
by
the
word
and
i
would
count
off
per
cent
for
epigrams
per
cent
for
dialect
and
some
quarter
or
so
for
those
stage
directions
in
italics
which
they
use
to
pad
out
their
work
so
i
will
not
repeat
this
experiment
but
next
time
i
come
to
a
bit
of
road
about
which
there
is
nothing
to
say
i
will
tell
a
story
or
sing
a
song
and
to
that
i
pledge
myself
by
the
way
i
am
reminded
of
something
do
you
know
those
books
and
stories
in
which
parts
of
the
dialogues
often
have
no
words
at
all
only
dots
and
dashes
and
asterisks
and
interrogations
i
wonder
what
the
people
are
paid
for
it
if
i
knew
i
would
earn
a
mint
of
money
for
i
believe
i
have
a
talent
for
it
look
at
this
there
that
seems
to
me
worth
a
good
deal
more
money
than
all
the
modern
of
character
and
nonsense
ever
written
what
verve
what
terseness
and
yet
how
clear
lector
let
us
be
getting
on
auctor
by
all
means
and
let
us
consider
more
enduring
things
after
a
few
miles
the
road
going
upwards
i
passed
through
another
gap
in
the
hills
and
lector
pardon
me
but
i
am
still
ruminating
upon
that
little
tragedy
of
yours
why
was
the
guardian
a
duchess
auctor
well
it
was
a
short
play
and
modern
was
it
not
lector
yes
and
therefore
of
course
you
must
have
a
title
in
it
i
know
that
i
do
not
object
to
it
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
a
duchess
auctor
on
account
of
the
reduction
of
scale
the
concentration
of
the
thing
you
see
in
the
full
play
there
would
have
been
a
lord
two
baronets
and
say
three
ladies
and
i
could
have
put
suitable
words
into
their
mouths
as
it
was
i
had
to
make
absolutely
sure
of
the
element
of
nobility
without
any
help
and
as
it
were
in
one
startling
moment
do
you
follow
is
it
not
art
i
can
not
conceive
why
a
pilgrimage
an
adventure
so
naturally
full
of
great
wonderful
and
holy
things
should
breed
such
fantastic
nonsense
as
all
this
but
remember
at
least
the
little
acolyte
of
rheims
whose
father
in
seeing
him
apt
for
religion
put
him
into
a
cassock
and
designed
him
for
the
church
whereupon
the
youngling
began
to
be
as
careless
and
devilish
as
mercury
putting
beeswax
on
the
misericords
burning
feathers
in
the
censer
and
even
going
round
himself
with
the
plate
without
leave
and
scolding
the
rich
in
loud
whispers
when
they
did
not
put
in
enough
so
one
way
with
another
they
sent
him
home
to
his
father
the
archbishop
thrusting
him
out
of
the
south
porch
with
his
own
hands
and
giving
him
the
common
or
ferial
malediction
which
is
much
the
same
as
that
used
by
carters
to
stray
dogs
when
his
father
saw
him
he
fumed
terribly
cursing
like
a
pagan
and
asking
whether
his
son
were
a
roysterer
fit
for
the
gallows
as
well
as
a
fool
fit
for
a
cassock
on
hearing
which
complaint
the
son
very
humbly
and
contritely
said
is
not
my
fault
but
the
contact
with
the
things
of
the
church
that
makes
me
gambol
and
frisk
just
as
the
devil
they
say
is
a
good
enough
fellow
left
to
himself
and
is
only
moderately
heated
yet
when
you
put
him
into
holy
water
all
the
world
is
witness
how
he
hisses
and
boils
the
boy
then
taking
a
little
lamb
which
happened
to
be
in
the
said
see
this
little
lamb
how
demure
he
is
and
how
simple
and
innocent
and
how
foolish
and
how
tractable
yet
observe
with
that
he
whipped
the
cassock
from
his
arm
where
he
was
carrying
it
and
threw
it
all
over
the
lamb
covering
his
head
and
body
and
the
lamb
began
plunging
and
kicking
and
bucking
and
rolling
and
heaving
and
sliding
and
rearing
and
pawing
and
most
vigorously
wrestling
with
the
clerical
and
hierarchically
constraining
garment
of
darkness
and
bleating
all
the
while
more
and
more
angrily
and
loudly
for
all
the
world
like
the
great
goat
baphomet
himself
when
the
witches
dance
about
him
on
but
when
the
boy
suddenly
plucked
off
the
cassock
again
the
lamb
after
sneezing
a
little
and
finding
his
feet
became
quite
gentle
once
more
and
looked
only
a
little
confused
and
dazed
father
said
the
boy
proof
to
you
of
how
the
meekest
may
be
driven
to
desperation
by
the
shackles
i
speak
of
and
which
i
pray
you
never
lay
upon
me
again
his
father
finding
him
so
practical
and
wise
made
over
his
whole
fortune
and
business
to
him
and
thus
escaped
the
very
heavy
heriot
and
death
dues
of
those
days
for
he
was
a
socage
tenant
of
st
remi
in
double
burgage
but
we
stopped
all
that
here
in
england
by
the
statute
of
uses
and
i
must
be
getting
back
to
the
road
before
the
dark
catches
me
as
i
was
saying
i
came
to
a
gap
in
the
hills
and
there
was
there
a
house
or
two
called
gansbrunnen
and
one
of
the
houses
was
an
inn
just
by
the
inn
the
road
turned
away
sharply
up
the
valley
the
very
last
slope
of
the
jura
the
last
parallel
ridge
lay
straight
before
me
all
solemn
dark
and
wooded
and
making
a
high
feathery
line
against
the
noon
to
cross
this
there
was
but
a
vague
path
rather
misleading
and
the
name
of
the
mountain
was
weissenstein
so
before
that
last
effort
which
should
lead
me
over
those
thousands
of
feet
and
to
nourish
instinct
which
would
be
of
use
to
me
when
i
got
into
that
impenetrable
wood
i
turned
into
the
inn
for
wine
a
very
old
woman
having
the
appearance
of
a
witch
sat
at
a
dark
table
by
the
little
window
of
the
dark
room
she
was
crooning
to
herself
and
i
made
the
sign
of
the
evil
eye
and
asked
her
in
french
for
wine
but
french
she
did
not
understand
catching
however
two
words
which
sounded
like
the
english
and
i
said
after
the
last
and
nodded
and
she
brought
up
a
glass
of
exceedingly
good
red
wine
which
i
drank
in
silence
she
watching
me
uncannily
then
i
paid
her
with
a
piece
and
she
gave
me
a
quantity
of
small
change
rapidly
which
as
i
counted
it
i
found
to
contain
one
greek
piece
of
fifty
lepta
very
manifestly
of
lead
this
i
held
up
angrily
before
her
and
not
without
courage
for
it
is
hard
to
deal
with
the
darker
powers
i
recited
to
her
slowly
that
familiar
verse
which
the
satyricus
empiricius
was
for
ever
using
in
his
now
classical
attacks
on
the
grammarians
and
without
any
alexandrian
twaddle
of
accents
i
intoned
to
her
and
so
left
her
astounded
to
repentance
or
to
shame
then
i
went
out
into
the
sunlight
and
crossing
over
running
water
put
myself
out
of
her
power
the
wood
went
up
darkly
and
the
path
branched
here
and
there
so
that
i
was
soon
uncertain
of
my
way
but
i
followed
generally
what
seemed
to
me
the
most
southerly
course
and
so
came
at
last
up
steeply
through
a
dip
or
ravine
that
ended
high
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
just
as
i
came
to
the
end
of
the
rise
after
perhaps
an
hour
perhaps
two
of
that
great
curtain
of
forest
which
had
held
the
mountain
side
the
trees
fell
away
to
brushwood
there
was
a
gate
and
then
the
path
was
lost
upon
a
fine
open
sward
which
was
the
very
top
of
the
jura
and
the
coping
of
that
multiple
wall
which
defends
the
swiss
plain
i
had
crossed
it
straight
from
edge
to
edge
never
turning
out
of
my
way
it
was
too
marshy
to
lie
down
on
it
so
i
stood
a
moment
to
breathe
and
look
about
me
it
was
evident
that
nothing
higher
remained
for
though
a
new
line
of
wood
firs
and
beeches
stood
before
me
yet
nothing
appeared
above
them
and
i
knew
that
they
must
be
the
fringe
of
the
descent
i
approached
this
edge
of
wood
and
saw
that
it
had
a
rough
fence
of
post
and
rails
bounding
it
and
as
i
was
looking
for
the
entry
of
a
path
for
my
original
path
was
lost
as
such
tracks
are
in
the
damp
grass
of
the
little
down
there
came
to
me
one
of
those
great
revelations
which
betray
to
us
suddenly
the
higher
things
and
stand
afterwards
firm
in
our
minds
there
on
this
upper
meadow
where
so
far
i
had
felt
nothing
but
the
ordinary
gladness
of
the
summit
i
had
a
vision
what
was
it
i
saw
if
you
think
i
saw
this
or
that
and
if
you
think
i
am
inventing
the
words
you
know
nothing
of
men
i
saw
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
in
front
of
me
a
sight
in
the
sky
that
made
me
stop
breathing
just
as
great
danger
at
sea
or
great
surprise
in
love
or
a
great
deliverance
will
make
a
man
stop
breathing
i
saw
something
i
had
known
in
the
west
as
a
boy
something
i
had
never
seen
so
grandly
discovered
as
was
this
in
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
was
a
great
promise
of
unexpected
lights
beyond
i
pushed
left
and
right
along
that
edge
of
the
forest
and
along
the
fence
that
bound
it
until
i
found
a
place
where
the
stopped
leaving
a
gap
and
where
on
the
right
beyond
the
gap
was
a
tree
whose
leaves
had
failed
there
the
ground
broke
away
steeply
below
me
and
the
beeches
fell
one
below
the
other
like
a
vast
cascade
towards
the
limestone
cliffs
that
dipped
down
still
further
beyond
my
sight
i
looked
through
this
framing
hollow
and
praised
god
for
there
below
me
thousands
of
feet
below
me
was
what
seemed
an
illimitable
plain
at
the
end
of
that
world
was
an
horizon
and
the
dim
bluish
sky
that
overhangs
an
horizon
there
was
brume
in
it
and
thickness
one
saw
the
sky
beyond
the
edge
of
the
world
getting
purer
as
the
vault
rose
but
right
up
a
belt
in
that
empyrean
ran
peak
and
field
and
needle
of
intense
ice
remote
remote
from
the
world
sky
beneath
them
and
sky
above
them
a
steadfast
legion
they
glittered
as
though
with
the
armour
of
the
immovable
armies
of
heaven
two
days
march
three
days
march
away
they
stood
up
like
the
walls
of
eden
i
say
it
again
they
stopped
my
breath
i
had
seen
them
so
little
are
we
we
men
so
much
are
we
immersed
in
our
muddy
and
immediate
interests
that
we
think
by
numbers
and
recitals
to
comprehend
distance
or
time
or
any
of
our
limiting
infinities
here
were
these
magnificent
creatures
of
god
i
mean
the
alps
which
now
for
the
first
time
i
saw
from
the
height
of
the
jura
and
because
they
were
fifty
or
sixty
miles
away
and
because
they
were
a
mile
or
two
high
they
were
become
something
different
from
us
others
and
could
strike
one
motionless
with
the
awe
of
supernatural
things
up
there
in
the
sky
to
which
only
clouds
belong
and
birds
and
the
last
trembling
colours
of
pure
light
they
stood
fast
and
hard
not
moving
as
do
the
things
of
the
sky
they
were
as
distant
as
the
little
upper
clouds
of
summer
as
fine
and
tenuous
but
in
their
reflection
and
in
their
quality
as
it
were
of
weapons
like
spears
and
shields
of
an
unknown
array
they
occupied
the
sky
with
a
sublime
invasion
and
the
things
proper
to
the
sky
were
forgotten
by
me
in
their
presence
as
i
gazed
to
what
emotion
shall
i
compare
this
astonishment
so
in
first
love
one
finds
that
can
belong
to
their
sharp
steadfastness
and
their
clean
uplifted
lines
compelled
my
adoration
up
there
the
sky
above
and
below
them
part
of
the
sky
but
part
of
us
the
great
peaks
made
communion
between
that
homing
creeping
part
of
me
which
loves
vineyards
and
dances
and
a
slow
movement
among
pastures
and
that
other
part
which
is
only
properly
at
home
in
heaven
i
say
that
this
kind
of
description
is
useless
and
that
it
is
better
to
address
prayers
to
such
things
than
to
attempt
to
interpret
them
for
others
these
the
great
alps
seen
thus
link
one
in
some
way
to
immortality
nor
is
it
possible
to
convey
or
even
to
suggest
those
few
fifty
miles
and
those
few
thousand
feet
there
is
something
more
let
me
put
it
thus
that
from
the
height
of
weissenstein
i
saw
as
it
were
my
religion
i
mean
humility
the
fear
of
death
the
terror
of
height
and
of
distance
the
glory
of
god
the
infinite
potentiality
of
reception
whence
springs
that
divine
thirst
of
the
soul
my
aspiration
also
towards
completion
and
my
confidence
in
the
dual
destiny
for
i
know
that
we
laughers
have
a
gross
cousinship
with
the
most
high
and
it
is
this
contrast
and
perpetual
quarrel
which
feeds
a
spring
of
merriment
in
the
soul
of
a
sane
man
since
i
could
now
see
such
a
wonder
and
it
could
work
such
things
in
my
mind
therefore
some
day
i
should
be
part
of
it
that
is
what
i
felt
this
it
is
also
which
leads
some
men
to
climb
but
not
me
for
i
am
afraid
of
slipping
down
then
you
will
say
if
i
felt
all
this
why
do
i
draw
it
and
put
it
in
my
book
seeing
that
my
drawings
are
only
for
fun
my
jest
drags
down
such
a
memory
and
makes
it
ludicrous
well
i
said
in
my
beginning
that
i
would
note
down
whatever
most
impressed
me
except
figures
which
i
can
not
draw
i
mean
figures
of
human
beings
for
mathematical
figures
i
can
draw
well
enough
and
i
have
never
failed
in
this
promise
except
where
as
in
the
case
of
porrentruy
my
drawing
was
blown
away
by
the
wind
and
lost
if
anything
ever
is
lost
so
i
put
down
here
this
extraordinary
drawing
of
what
i
saw
which
is
about
as
much
like
it
as
a
printed
song
full
of
misprints
is
to
that
same
song
sung
by
an
army
on
the
march
and
i
am
consoled
by
remembering
that
if
i
could
draw
infinitely
well
then
it
would
become
sacrilege
to
attempt
to
draw
that
sight
moreover
i
am
not
going
to
waste
any
more
time
discussing
why
i
put
in
this
little
drawing
if
it
disturbs
your
conception
of
what
it
was
i
saw
paste
over
it
a
little
bit
of
paper
i
have
made
it
small
for
the
purpose
but
remember
that
the
paper
should
be
thin
and
opaque
for
thick
paper
will
interfere
with
the
shape
of
this
book
and
transparent
paper
will
disturb
you
with
a
memory
of
the
picture
it
was
all
full
of
this
as
a
man
is
full
of
music
just
after
hearing
it
that
i
plunged
down
into
the
steep
forest
that
led
towards
the
great
plain
then
having
found
a
path
i
worked
down
it
by
a
kind
of
gully
that
led
through
to
a
place
where
the
limestone
cliffs
were
broken
and
so
my
map
told
me
to
the
town
of
soleure
which
stands
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
upon
the
river
aar
i
was
an
hour
or
more
going
down
the
enormous
face
of
the
jura
which
is
here
an
escarpment
a
cliff
of
great
height
and
contains
but
few
such
breaks
by
which
men
can
pick
their
way
it
was
when
i
was
about
down
the
mountain
side
that
its
vastness
most
impressed
me
and
yet
it
had
been
but
a
platform
as
it
were
from
which
to
view
the
alps
and
their
much
greater
sublimity
this
vastness
even
of
these
limestone
mountains
took
me
especially
at
a
place
where
the
path
bordered
a
steep
or
rather
precipitous
lift
of
white
rock
to
which
only
here
and
there
a
tree
could
cling
i
was
still
very
high
up
but
looking
somewhat
more
eastward
than
before
and
the
plain
went
on
inimitably
towards
some
low
vague
hills
nor
in
that
direction
could
any
snow
be
seen
in
the
sky
then
at
last
i
came
to
the
slopes
which
make
a
little
bank
under
the
mountains
and
there
finding
a
highroad
and
oppressed
somewhat
suddenly
by
the
afternoon
heat
of
those
low
places
i
went
on
more
slowly
towards
soleure
beside
me
on
the
road
were
many
houses
shaded
by
great
trees
built
of
wood
and
standing
apart
to
each
of
them
almost
was
a
little
run
by
the
spring
which
came
down
out
of
the
ravine
the
in
most
cases
worked
a
simple
little
machine
for
sawing
planks
but
in
other
cases
it
seemed
used
for
some
purpose
inside
the
house
which
i
could
not
divine
perhaps
for
spinning
all
this
place
was
full
of
working
and
the
men
sang
and
spoke
at
their
work
in
german
which
i
could
not
understand
i
did
indeed
find
one
man
a
young
man
carrying
a
scythe
who
knew
a
little
french
and
was
going
my
way
i
asked
him
therefore
to
teach
me
german
but
he
had
not
taught
me
much
before
we
were
at
the
gates
of
the
old
town
and
then
i
left
him
it
is
thus
you
will
see
that
for
my
next
four
days
or
five
which
were
passed
among
the
swiss
i
was
utterly
alone
this
book
must
not
go
on
for
ever
therefore
i
can
not
say
very
much
about
soleure
although
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
about
it
it
is
distinguished
by
an
impression
of
unity
and
of
civic
life
which
i
had
already
discovered
in
all
these
swiss
towns
for
though
men
talk
of
finding
the
middle
ages
here
or
there
i
for
my
part
never
find
it
save
where
there
has
been
democracy
to
preserve
it
thus
i
have
seen
the
middle
ages
especially
alive
in
the
small
towns
of
northern
france
and
i
have
seen
the
middle
ages
in
the
university
of
paris
here
also
in
switzerland
as
i
had
seen
it
at
st
ursanne
so
i
found
it
now
at
soleure
there
were
huge
gates
flanking
the
town
and
there
was
that
evening
a
continual
noise
of
rifles
at
which
the
swiss
are
for
ever
practising
over
the
church
however
i
saw
something
terribly
seventeenth
century
namely
jaweh
in
great
hebrew
letters
upon
its
front
well
dining
there
of
the
best
they
had
to
give
me
for
this
was
another
milestone
in
my
pilgrimage
i
became
foolishly
refreshed
and
valiant
and
instead
of
sleeping
in
soleure
as
a
wise
man
would
have
done
i
determined
though
it
was
now
nearly
dark
to
push
on
upon
the
road
to
burgdorf
i
therefore
crossed
the
river
aar
which
is
here
magnificently
broad
and
strong
and
has
bastions
jutting
out
into
it
in
a
very
bold
fashion
i
saw
the
last
colourless
light
of
evening
making
its
waters
seem
like
dull
metal
between
the
gloomy
banks
i
felt
the
beginnings
of
fatigue
and
half
regretted
my
determination
but
as
it
is
quite
certain
that
one
should
never
go
back
i
went
on
in
the
darkness
i
do
not
know
how
many
miles
till
i
reached
some
cross
roads
and
an
inn
this
inn
was
very
poor
and
the
people
had
never
heard
in
their
lives
apparently
that
a
poor
man
on
foot
might
not
be
able
to
talk
german
which
seemed
to
me
an
astonishing
thing
and
as
i
sat
there
ordering
beer
for
myself
and
for
a
number
of
peasants
who
but
for
this
would
have
me
their
butt
and
even
as
it
was
found
something
monstrous
in
me
i
pondered
during
my
continual
attempts
to
converse
with
them
for
i
had
picked
up
some
ten
words
of
their
language
upon
the
folly
of
those
who
imagine
the
world
to
be
grown
smaller
by
railways
i
suppose
this
place
was
more
untouched
as
the
phrase
goes
that
is
more
living
more
intense
and
more
powerful
to
affect
others
whenever
it
may
be
called
to
do
so
than
are
even
the
dear
villages
of
sussex
that
lie
under
my
downs
for
those
are
haunted
by
a
nearly
cosmopolitan
class
of
gentry
who
will
have
actors
financiers
and
what
not
to
come
and
stay
with
them
and
who
read
the
paper
and
from
time
to
time
address
their
village
folk
upon
matters
of
politics
but
here
in
this
broad
plain
by
the
banks
of
the
emmen
they
knew
of
nothing
but
themselves
and
the
church
which
is
the
common
bond
of
europe
and
they
were
in
the
right
way
hence
it
was
doubly
hard
on
me
that
they
should
think
me
such
a
stranger
when
i
had
become
a
little
morose
at
their
perpetual
laughter
i
asked
for
a
bed
and
the
landlady
a
woman
of
some
talent
showed
me
on
her
fingers
that
the
beds
were
and
a
franc
i
determined
upon
the
best
and
was
given
indeed
a
very
pleasant
room
having
in
it
the
statue
of
a
saint
and
full
of
a
country
air
but
i
had
done
too
much
in
this
night
march
as
you
will
presently
learn
for
my
next
day
was
a
day
without
salt
and
in
it
appreciation
left
me
and
this
breakdown
of
appreciation
was
due
to
what
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
to
be
fatigue
but
to
what
was
undoubtedly
a
deep
inner
exhaustion
when
i
awoke
next
morning
it
was
as
it
always
is
no
one
was
awake
and
i
had
the
field
to
myself
to
slip
out
as
i
chose
i
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
dawn
the
race
had
made
its
own
surroundings
these
people
who
suffocated
with
laughter
at
the
idea
of
one
knowing
no
german
had
produced
as
it
were
a
german
picture
by
the
mere
influence
of
years
and
years
of
similar
thoughts
out
of
my
window
i
saw
the
eaves
coming
low
down
i
saw
an
against
the
grey
light
the
tangled
grass
in
the
little
garden
the
and
the
standing
butt
were
all
what
i
had
seen
in
those
german
pictures
which
they
put
into
books
for
children
and
which
are
drawn
in
thick
black
lines
nor
did
i
see
any
reason
why
tame
faces
should
not
appear
in
that
framework
i
expected
the
light
lank
hair
and
the
heavy
unlifting
step
of
the
people
whose
only
emotions
are
in
music
but
it
was
too
early
for
any
one
to
be
about
and
my
german
garden
ainsi
had
to
suffice
me
for
an
impression
of
the
central
europeans
i
gazed
at
it
a
little
while
as
it
grew
lighter
then
i
went
downstairs
and
slipped
the
latch
which
being
german
was
of
a
quaint
design
i
went
out
into
the
road
and
sighed
profoundly
all
that
day
was
destined
to
be
covered
so
far
as
my
spirit
was
concerned
with
a
motionless
lethargy
nothing
seemed
properly
to
interest
or
to
concern
me
and
not
till
evening
was
i
visited
by
any
muse
even
my
pain
which
was
now
dull
and
chronic
was
no
longer
a
subject
for
my
entertainment
and
i
suffered
from
an
uneasy
isolation
that
had
not
the
merit
of
sharpness
and
was
no
spur
to
the
mind
i
had
the
feeling
that
every
one
i
might
see
would
be
a
stranger
and
that
their
language
would
be
unfamiliar
to
me
and
this
unlike
most
men
who
travel
i
had
never
felt
before
the
reason
being
this
that
if
a
man
has
english
thoroughly
he
can
wander
over
a
great
part
of
the
world
familiarly
and
meet
men
with
whom
he
can
talk
and
if
he
has
french
thoroughly
all
italy
and
i
suppose
spain
certainly
belgium
are
open
to
him
not
perhaps
that
he
will
understand
what
he
hears
or
will
be
understood
of
others
but
that
the
order
and
nature
of
the
words
and
the
gestures
accompanying
them
are
his
own
here
however
i
to
whom
english
and
french
were
the
same
was
to
spend
it
seemed
whole
days
among
a
people
who
put
their
verbs
at
the
end
where
the
curses
or
the
endearments
come
in
french
and
english
and
many
of
whose
words
stand
for
ideas
we
have
not
got
i
had
no
room
for
i
could
not
sit
at
tables
and
expand
the
air
with
terrible
stories
of
adventure
nor
ask
about
their
politics
nor
provoke
them
to
laughter
or
sadness
by
my
tales
it
seemed
a
poor
pilgrimage
taken
among
dumb
men
also
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
had
experienced
the
ebb
of
some
vitality
for
it
is
the
saddest
thing
about
us
that
this
bright
spirit
with
which
we
are
lit
from
within
like
lanterns
can
suffer
dimness
such
frailty
makes
one
fear
that
extinction
is
our
final
destiny
and
it
saps
us
with
numbness
and
we
are
less
than
ourselves
seven
nights
had
i
been
on
pilgrimage
and
two
of
them
had
i
passed
in
the
open
seven
great
heights
had
i
climbed
the
forest
archettes
the
ballon
the
mont
terrible
the
watershed
the
pass
by
moutier
the
weissenstein
seven
depths
had
i
fallen
to
twice
to
the
moselle
the
gap
of
belfort
the
gorge
of
the
doubs
glovelier
valley
the
hole
of
moutier
and
now
this
plain
of
the
aar
i
had
marched
miles
it
was
no
wonder
that
on
this
eighth
day
i
was
oppressed
and
that
all
the
light
long
i
drank
no
good
wine
met
no
one
to
remember
well
nor
sang
any
songs
all
this
part
of
my
way
was
full
of
what
they
call
duty
and
i
was
sustained
only
by
my
knowledge
that
the
vast
mountains
which
had
disappeared
would
be
part
of
my
life
very
soon
if
i
still
went
on
steadily
towards
rome
the
sun
had
risen
when
i
reached
burgdorf
and
i
there
went
to
a
railway
station
and
outside
of
it
drank
coffee
and
ate
bread
i
also
bought
old
newspapers
in
french
and
looked
at
everything
wearily
and
with
sad
eyes
there
was
nothing
to
draw
how
can
a
man
draw
pain
in
the
foot
and
knee
and
that
was
all
there
was
remarkable
at
that
moment
i
watched
a
train
come
in
it
was
full
of
tourists
who
it
may
have
been
a
subjective
illusion
seemed
to
me
common
and
worthless
people
and
sad
into
the
bargain
it
was
going
to
interlaken
and
i
felt
a
languid
contempt
for
people
who
went
to
interlaken
instead
of
driving
right
across
the
great
hills
to
rome
after
an
hour
or
so
of
this
melancholy
dawdling
i
put
a
map
before
me
on
a
little
marble
table
ordered
some
more
coffee
and
blew
into
my
tepid
life
a
moment
of
warmth
by
the
effort
of
coming
to
a
necessary
decision
i
had
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
left
lorraine
the
choice
of
two
roads
and
why
this
was
so
the
following
map
will
make
clear
here
you
see
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
following
the
straight
way
to
rome
but
that
one
must
go
a
few
miles
east
or
west
of
it
from
burgundy
one
has
to
strike
a
point
on
the
sources
of
the
emmen
and
burgdorf
is
on
the
emmen
therefore
one
might
follow
the
emmen
all
the
way
up
but
it
seemed
that
the
road
climbed
up
above
a
gorge
that
way
whereas
by
the
other
which
is
just
as
straight
the
road
is
good
it
seemed
and
fairly
level
so
i
chose
this
latter
eastern
way
which
at
the
bifurcation
takes
one
up
a
tributary
of
the
emmen
then
over
a
rise
to
the
upper
emmen
again
do
you
want
it
made
plainer
than
that
i
should
think
not
and
tell
me
what
can
it
profit
you
to
know
these
geographical
details
believe
me
i
write
them
down
for
my
own
gratification
not
yours
i
say
a
day
without
salt
a
trudge
the
air
was
ordinary
the
colours
common
men
animals
and
trees
indifferent
something
had
stopped
working
our
energy
also
is
from
god
and
we
should
never
be
proud
of
it
even
if
we
can
cover
thirty
miles
day
after
day
as
i
can
or
bend
a
peony
in
one
hand
as
could
frocot
the
driver
in
my
piece
a
man
you
never
knew
or
write
bad
verse
very
rapidly
as
can
so
many
moderns
i
say
our
energy
also
is
from
god
and
we
should
never
be
proud
of
it
as
though
it
were
from
ourselves
but
we
should
accept
it
as
a
kind
of
present
and
we
should
be
thankful
for
it
just
as
a
man
should
thank
god
for
his
reason
as
did
the
madman
in
the
story
of
the
rose
who
thanked
god
that
he
at
least
was
sane
though
all
the
rest
of
the
world
had
recently
lost
their
reason
indeed
this
defaillance
and
breakdown
which
comes
from
time
to
time
over
the
mind
is
a
very
sad
thing
but
it
can
be
made
of
great
use
to
us
if
we
will
draw
from
it
the
lesson
that
we
ourselves
are
nothing
perhaps
it
is
a
grace
perhaps
in
these
moments
our
minds
repose
anyhow
a
day
without
salt
you
understand
that
under
or
in
these
circumstances
when
i
was
at
oxford
there
was
a
great
and
terrible
debate
that
shook
the
empire
and
that
intensely
exercised
the
men
whom
we
send
out
to
govern
the
empire
and
which
therefore
must
have
had
its
effect
upon
the
empire
as
to
whether
one
should
say
these
or
these
circumstances
nor
did
i
settle
matters
by
calling
a
conclave
and
suggesting
quum
ita
as
a
common
formula
because
a
new
debate
arose
upon
when
you
should
say
and
when
you
should
say
and
they
all
wrangled
like
kittens
in
a
basket
until
there
rose
a
man
from
an
outlying
college
who
said
my
part
i
will
say
that
under
these
circumstances
or
in
these
circumstances
or
in
spite
of
these
circumstances
or
hovering
playfully
above
these
circumstances
or
i
take
you
all
for
fools
and
pedants
in
the
chief
in
the
chevron
and
in
the
quarter
fess
fools
absolute
and
pedants
lordless
free
fools
unlanded
fools
and
fools
incommensurable
and
pedants
displayed
and
rampant
of
the
tierce
major
fools
incalculable
and
pedants
irreparable
indeed
the
arch
in
a
universe
of
pedantic
folly
and
foolish
pedantry
o
you
of
the
world
but
by
this
time
he
was
alone
and
thus
was
this
great
question
never
properly
decided
under
these
circumstances
then
or
in
these
circumstances
it
would
profit
you
but
little
if
i
were
to
attempt
the
description
of
the
valley
of
the
emmen
of
the
first
of
the
alps
and
of
the
very
uninteresting
valley
which
runs
on
from
langnau
i
had
best
employ
my
time
in
telling
the
story
of
the
hungry
student
lector
and
if
you
are
so
and
bereft
of
all
emotions
how
can
you
tell
a
story
auctor
these
two
conditions
permit
me
first
that
i
am
writing
some
time
after
and
that
i
have
recovered
secondly
that
the
story
is
not
mine
but
taken
straight
out
of
that
nationalist
newspaper
which
had
served
me
so
long
to
wrap
up
my
bread
and
bacon
in
my
haversack
this
is
the
story
and
i
will
tell
it
you
now
i
think
of
it
it
would
be
a
great
waste
of
time
here
am
i
no
farther
than
perhaps
a
third
of
my
journey
and
i
have
already
admitted
so
much
digression
that
my
pilgrimage
is
like
the
story
of
a
man
asleep
and
dreaming
instead
of
the
plain
honest
and
straightforward
narrative
of
fact
i
will
therefore
postpone
the
story
of
the
hungry
student
till
i
get
into
the
plains
of
italy
or
into
the
barren
hills
of
that
peninsula
or
among
the
towns
of
tuscany
or
in
some
other
place
where
a
little
padding
will
do
neither
you
nor
me
any
great
harm
on
the
other
hand
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
give
you
any
kind
of
description
of
this
intolerable
day
march
if
you
want
some
kind
of
visual
concept
pretty
word
take
all
these
little
châlets
which
were
beginning
and
make
what
you
can
of
them
lector
where
are
they
auctor
they
are
still
in
switzerland
not
here
they
were
overnumerous
as
i
maundered
up
from
where
at
last
the
road
leaves
the
valley
and
makes
over
a
little
pass
for
a
place
called
schangnau
but
though
it
is
not
a
story
on
the
contrary
an
exact
incident
and
the
truth
a
thing
that
i
would
swear
to
in
the
court
of
justice
or
quite
willingly
and
cheerfully
believe
if
another
man
told
it
to
me
or
even
take
as
historical
if
i
found
it
in
a
modern
english
history
of
the
church
though
i
repeat
it
is
a
thing
actually
lived
yet
i
will
tell
it
you
it
was
at
the
very
end
of
the
road
and
when
an
enormous
weariness
had
begun
to
add
some
kind
of
interest
to
this
stuffless
episode
of
the
dull
day
that
a
peasant
with
a
brutal
face
driving
a
cart
very
rapidly
came
up
with
me
i
said
to
him
nothing
but
he
said
to
me
some
words
in
german
which
i
did
not
understand
we
were
at
that
moment
just
opposite
a
little
inn
upon
the
right
hand
of
the
road
and
the
peasant
began
making
signs
to
me
to
hold
his
horse
for
him
while
he
went
in
and
drank
how
willing
i
was
to
do
this
you
will
not
perhaps
understand
unless
you
have
that
delicate
and
subtle
pleasure
in
the
holding
of
heads
which
is
the
boast
and
glory
of
some
rare
minds
and
i
was
the
more
willing
to
do
it
from
the
fact
that
i
have
the
habit
of
this
kind
of
thing
acquired
in
the
french
manoeuvres
and
had
once
held
a
horse
for
no
less
a
person
than
a
general
of
division
who
gave
me
a
franc
for
it
and
this
franc
i
spent
later
with
the
men
of
my
battery
purchasing
wine
so
to
make
a
long
story
short
as
the
publisher
said
when
he
published
the
popular
edition
of
i
held
the
horse
for
the
peasant
always
of
course
under
the
implicit
understanding
that
he
should
allow
me
when
he
came
out
to
have
a
drink
which
i
of
course
expected
him
to
bring
in
his
own
hands
far
from
it
i
can
understand
the
anger
which
some
people
feel
against
the
swiss
when
they
travel
in
that
country
though
i
will
always
hold
that
it
is
monstrous
to
come
into
a
man
country
of
your
own
accord
and
especially
into
a
country
so
free
and
so
well
governed
as
is
switzerland
and
then
to
quarrel
with
the
particular
type
of
citizen
that
you
find
there
let
us
not
discuss
politics
the
point
is
that
the
peasant
sat
in
there
drinking
with
his
friends
for
a
good
of
an
hour
now
and
then
a
man
would
come
out
and
look
at
the
sky
and
cough
and
spit
and
turn
round
again
and
say
something
to
the
people
within
in
german
and
go
off
but
no
one
paid
the
least
attention
to
me
as
i
held
this
horse
i
was
already
in
a
very
angry
and
irritable
mood
for
the
horse
was
restive
and
smelt
his
stable
and
wished
to
break
away
from
me
and
all
angry
and
irritable
as
i
was
i
turned
around
to
see
if
this
man
were
coming
to
relieve
me
but
i
saw
him
laughing
and
joking
with
the
people
inside
and
they
were
all
looking
my
way
out
of
their
window
as
they
laughed
i
may
have
been
wrong
but
i
thought
they
were
laughing
at
me
a
man
who
knows
the
swiss
intimately
and
who
has
written
a
book
upon
drink
traffic
the
example
of
switzerland
tells
me
they
certainly
were
not
laughing
at
me
at
any
rate
i
thought
they
were
and
moved
by
a
sudden
anger
i
let
go
the
reins
gave
the
horse
a
great
clout
and
set
him
off
careering
and
galloping
like
a
whirlwind
down
the
road
from
which
he
had
come
with
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
all
the
storms
of
heaven
in
his
four
feet
instantly
as
you
may
imagine
all
the
scoffers
came
tumbling
out
of
the
inn
hullabooling
gesticulating
and
running
like
madmen
after
the
horse
and
one
old
man
even
turned
to
protest
to
me
but
i
setting
my
teeth
grasping
my
staff
and
remembering
the
purpose
of
my
great
journey
set
on
up
the
road
again
with
my
face
towards
rome
i
sincerely
hope
trust
and
pray
that
this
part
of
my
journey
will
not
seem
as
dull
to
you
as
it
did
to
me
at
the
time
or
as
it
does
to
me
now
while
i
write
of
it
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
it
can
not
seem
as
dull
for
i
had
to
walk
that
wretched
thirty
miles
or
so
all
the
day
long
whereas
you
have
not
even
to
read
it
for
i
am
not
going
to
say
anything
more
about
it
but
lead
you
straight
to
the
end
oh
blessed
quality
of
books
that
makes
them
a
refuge
from
living
for
in
a
book
everything
can
be
made
to
fit
in
all
tedium
can
be
skipped
over
and
the
intense
moments
can
be
made
timeless
and
eternal
and
as
a
poet
who
is
too
little
known
has
well
said
in
one
of
his
unpublished
lyrics
we
by
the
art
of
writing
can
fix
the
high
elusive
hour
and
stand
in
things
divine
and
as
for
high
elusive
hours
devil
a
bit
of
one
was
there
all
the
way
from
burgdorf
to
the
inn
of
the
bridge
except
the
ecstatic
flash
of
joy
when
i
sent
that
horse
careering
down
the
road
with
his
bad
master
after
him
and
all
his
gang
shouting
among
the
hollow
hills
so
it
was
already
evening
i
was
coming
more
tired
than
ever
to
a
kind
of
little
pass
by
which
my
road
would
bring
me
back
again
to
the
emmen
now
nothing
but
a
torrent
all
the
slope
down
the
other
side
of
the
little
pass
three
or
four
hundred
feet
perhaps
was
covered
by
a
village
called
if
i
remember
right
schangnau
and
there
was
a
large
school
on
my
right
and
a
great
number
of
children
there
dancing
round
in
a
ring
and
singing
songs
the
sight
so
cheered
me
that
i
determined
to
press
on
up
the
valley
though
with
no
definite
goal
for
the
night
it
was
a
foolish
decision
for
i
was
really
in
the
heart
of
an
unknown
country
at
the
end
of
roads
at
the
sources
of
rivers
beyond
help
i
knew
that
straight
before
me
not
five
miles
away
was
the
brienzer
grat
the
huge
high
wall
which
it
was
my
duty
to
cross
right
over
from
side
to
side
i
did
not
know
whether
or
not
there
was
an
inn
between
me
and
that
vast
barrier
the
light
was
failing
i
had
perhaps
some
vague
idea
of
sleeping
out
but
that
would
have
killed
me
for
a
heavy
mist
that
covered
all
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
that
made
a
roof
over
the
valley
began
to
drop
down
a
fine
rain
and
as
they
sing
in
church
on
christmas
eve
heavens
sent
down
their
dews
upon
a
just
man
but
that
was
written
in
palestine
where
rain
is
a
rare
blessing
there
and
then
in
the
cold
evening
they
would
have
done
better
to
have
warmed
the
righteous
there
is
no
controlling
them
they
mean
well
but
they
bungle
terribly
the
road
stopped
being
a
road
and
became
like
a
californian
trail
i
approached
enormous
gates
in
the
hills
high
precipitous
and
narrow
the
mist
rolled
over
them
hiding
their
summits
and
making
them
seem
infinitely
lifted
up
and
reaching
endlessly
into
the
thick
sky
the
straight
tenuous
lines
of
the
rain
made
them
seem
narrower
still
just
as
i
neared
them
hobbling
i
met
a
man
driving
two
cows
and
said
to
him
the
word
to
which
he
said
and
pointed
out
a
clump
of
trees
to
me
just
under
the
precipice
and
right
in
the
gates
i
speak
of
so
i
went
there
over
an
old
bridge
and
found
a
wooden
house
and
went
in
it
was
a
house
which
one
entered
without
ceremony
the
door
was
open
and
one
walked
straight
into
a
great
room
there
sat
three
men
playing
at
cards
i
saluted
them
loudly
in
french
english
and
latin
but
they
did
not
understand
me
and
what
seemed
remarkable
in
an
hotel
for
it
was
an
hotel
rather
than
an
inn
no
one
in
the
house
understood
me
neither
the
servants
nor
any
one
but
the
servants
did
not
laugh
at
me
as
had
the
poor
people
near
burgdorf
they
only
stood
round
me
looking
at
me
patiently
in
wonder
as
cows
do
at
trains
then
they
brought
me
food
and
as
i
did
not
know
the
names
of
the
different
kinds
of
food
i
had
to
eat
what
they
chose
and
the
angel
of
that
valley
protected
me
from
boiled
mutton
i
knew
however
the
word
wein
which
is
the
same
in
all
languages
and
so
drank
a
quart
of
it
consciously
and
of
a
set
purpose
then
i
slept
and
next
morning
at
dawn
i
rose
up
put
on
my
thin
wet
linen
clothes
and
went
downstairs
no
one
was
about
i
looked
around
for
something
to
fill
my
sack
i
picked
up
a
great
hunk
of
bread
from
the
table
and
went
out
shivering
into
the
cold
drizzle
that
was
still
falling
from
a
shrouded
sky
before
me
a
great
forbidding
wall
growing
blacker
as
it
went
upwards
and
ending
in
a
level
line
of
mist
stood
the
brienzer
grat
to
understand
what
i
next
had
to
do
it
is
necessary
to
look
back
at
the
little
map
on
page
you
will
observe
that
the
straight
way
to
rome
cuts
the
lake
of
brienz
rather
to
the
eastward
of
the
middle
and
then
goes
slap
over
wetterhorn
and
strikes
the
rhone
valley
at
a
place
called
ulrichen
that
is
how
a
bird
would
do
it
if
some
high
pope
of
birds
lived
in
rome
and
needed
visiting
as
for
instance
the
great
auk
or
if
some
old
primal
relic
sacred
to
birds
was
connected
therewith
as
for
instance
the
bones
of
the
dodo
but
i
digress
the
point
is
that
the
straight
line
takes
one
over
the
brienzer
grat
over
the
lake
and
then
over
the
wetterhorn
that
was
manifestly
impossible
but
whatever
of
it
was
possible
had
to
be
done
and
among
the
possible
things
was
clambering
over
the
high
ridge
of
the
brienzer
grat
instead
of
going
round
like
a
coward
by
interlaken
after
i
had
clambered
over
it
however
needs
must
i
should
have
to
take
a
pass
called
the
grimsel
pass
and
reach
the
rhone
valley
that
way
it
was
with
such
a
determination
that
i
had
come
here
to
the
upper
waters
of
the
emmen
and
stood
now
on
a
moist
morning
in
the
basin
where
that
stream
rises
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
range
that
divided
me
from
the
lake
the
brienzer
grat
is
an
extraordinary
thing
it
is
quite
straight
its
summits
are
of
course
of
different
heights
but
from
below
they
seem
even
like
a
ridge
and
indeed
the
whole
mountain
is
more
like
a
ridge
than
any
other
i
have
seen
at
one
end
is
a
peak
called
the
horn
the
other
end
falls
suddenly
above
interlaken
and
wherever
you
should
cut
it
you
would
get
a
section
like
this
for
it
is
as
steep
as
anything
can
be
short
of
sheer
rock
there
are
no
precipices
on
it
though
there
are
nasty
slabs
quite
high
enough
to
kill
a
man
i
saw
several
of
three
or
four
hundred
feet
it
is
about
five
or
six
thousand
feet
high
and
it
stands
right
up
and
along
the
northern
shore
of
the
lake
of
brienz
i
began
the
ascent
spongy
meads
that
soughed
under
the
feet
and
grew
steeper
as
one
rose
took
up
the
first
few
hundred
feet
little
rivulets
of
mere
dampness
ran
in
among
the
under
moss
and
such
very
small
hidden
flowers
as
there
were
drooped
with
the
surfeit
of
moisture
the
rain
was
now
indistinguishable
from
a
mist
and
indeed
i
had
come
so
near
to
the
level
belt
of
cloud
that
already
its
gloom
was
exchanged
for
that
diffused
light
which
fills
vapours
from
within
and
lends
them
their
mystery
a
belt
of
thick
brushwood
and
low
trees
lay
before
me
clinging
to
the
slope
and
as
i
pushed
with
great
difficulty
and
many
turns
to
right
and
left
through
its
tangle
a
wisp
of
cloud
enveloped
me
and
from
that
time
on
i
was
now
in
now
out
of
a
deceptive
drifting
fog
in
which
it
was
most
difficult
to
gauge
one
progress
now
and
then
a
higher
mass
of
rock
a
peak
on
the
ridge
would
show
clear
through
a
corridor
of
cloud
and
be
hidden
again
also
at
times
i
would
stand
hesitating
before
a
sharp
wall
or
slab
and
wait
for
a
shifting
of
the
fog
to
make
sure
of
the
best
way
round
i
struck
what
might
have
been
a
loose
path
or
perhaps
only
a
gully
lost
it
again
and
found
it
again
in
one
place
i
climbed
up
a
jagged
surface
for
fifty
feet
only
to
find
when
it
cleared
that
it
was
no
part
of
the
general
ascent
but
a
mere
obstacle
which
might
have
been
outflanked
at
another
time
i
stopped
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
at
an
edge
that
might
have
been
an
indefinite
fall
of
smooth
rock
but
that
turned
out
to
be
a
short
drop
easy
for
a
man
and
not
much
longer
than
my
body
so
i
went
upwards
always
drenched
and
doubting
and
not
sure
of
the
height
i
had
reached
at
any
time
at
last
i
came
to
a
place
where
a
smooth
stone
lay
between
two
pillared
monoliths
as
though
it
had
been
put
there
for
a
bench
though
all
around
me
was
dense
mist
yet
i
could
see
above
me
the
vague
shape
of
a
summit
looming
quite
near
so
i
said
to
myself
will
sit
here
and
wait
till
it
grows
lighter
and
clearer
for
i
must
now
be
within
two
or
three
hundred
feet
of
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
as
anything
at
all
may
be
on
the
other
side
i
had
best
go
carefully
and
knowing
my
way
so
i
sat
down
facing
the
way
i
had
to
go
and
looking
upwards
till
perhaps
a
movement
of
the
air
might
show
me
against
a
clear
sky
the
line
of
the
ridge
and
so
let
me
estimate
the
work
that
remained
to
do
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
point
where
i
judged
that
sky
line
to
lie
lest
i
should
miss
some
sudden
gleam
revealing
it
and
as
i
sat
there
i
grew
mournful
and
began
to
consider
the
folly
of
climbing
this
great
height
on
an
empty
stomach
the
soldiers
of
the
republic
fought
their
battles
often
before
breakfast
but
never
i
think
without
having
drunk
warm
coffee
and
no
one
should
attempt
great
efforts
without
some
such
refreshment
before
starting
indeed
my
fasting
and
the
rare
thin
air
of
the
height
the
chill
and
the
dampness
that
had
soaked
my
thin
clothes
through
and
through
quite
lowered
my
blood
and
left
it
piano
whimpering
and
irresolute
i
shivered
and
demanded
the
sun
then
i
bethought
me
of
the
hunk
of
bread
i
had
stolen
and
pulling
it
out
of
my
haversack
i
began
to
munch
that
ungrateful
breakfast
it
was
hard
and
stale
and
gave
me
little
sustenance
i
still
gazed
upwards
into
the
uniform
meaningless
light
fog
looking
for
the
ridge
suddenly
with
no
warning
to
prepare
the
mind
a
faint
but
distinct
wind
blew
upon
me
the
mist
rose
in
a
wreath
backward
and
upward
and
i
was
looking
through
clear
immensity
not
at
any
ridge
but
over
an
awful
gulf
at
great
white
fields
of
death
the
alps
were
right
upon
me
and
before
me
overwhelming
and
commanding
empty
downward
distances
of
air
between
them
and
me
was
a
narrow
dreadful
space
of
nothingness
and
silence
and
a
sheer
mile
below
us
both
a
floor
to
that
prodigious
hollow
lay
the
little
lake
my
stone
had
not
been
a
at
all
but
was
itself
the
summit
of
the
ridge
and
those
two
rocks
on
either
side
of
it
framed
a
notch
upon
the
very
edge
and
skyline
of
the
high
hills
of
brienz
surprise
and
wonder
had
not
time
to
form
in
my
spirit
before
both
were
swallowed
up
by
fear
the
proximity
of
that
immense
wall
of
cold
the
alps
seen
thus
full
from
the
level
of
its
middle
height
and
comprehended
as
it
can
not
be
from
the
depths
its
suggestion
of
something
never
changing
throughout
eternity
yet
dead
was
a
threat
to
the
eager
mind
they
the
vast
alps
all
wrapped
round
in
ice
frozen
and
their
immobility
enhanced
by
the
delicate
roaming
veils
which
as
from
an
attraction
hovered
in
their
hollows
seemed
to
halt
the
process
of
living
and
the
living
soul
whom
they
thus
perturbed
was
supported
by
no
companionship
there
were
no
trees
or
blades
of
grass
around
me
only
the
uneven
and
primal
stones
of
that
height
there
were
no
birds
in
the
gulf
there
was
no
sound
and
the
whiteness
of
the
glaciers
the
blackness
of
the
rocks
beyond
was
glistening
and
unsoftened
there
had
come
something
evil
into
their
sublimity
i
was
afraid
nor
could
i
bear
to
look
downwards
the
slope
was
in
no
way
a
danger
a
man
could
walk
up
it
without
often
using
his
hands
and
a
man
could
go
down
it
slowly
without
any
direct
fall
though
here
and
there
he
would
have
to
turn
round
at
each
dip
or
step
and
hold
with
his
hands
and
feel
a
little
for
his
foothold
i
suppose
the
general
slope
down
down
to
where
the
green
began
was
not
sixty
degrees
but
have
you
ever
tried
looking
down
five
thousand
feet
at
sixty
degrees
it
drags
the
mind
after
it
and
i
could
not
bear
to
begin
the
descent
however
i
reasoned
with
myself
i
said
to
myself
that
a
man
should
only
be
afraid
of
real
dangers
that
nightmare
was
not
for
the
daylight
that
there
was
now
no
mist
but
a
warm
sun
then
choosing
a
gully
where
water
sometimes
ran
but
now
dry
i
warily
began
to
descend
using
my
staff
and
leaning
well
backwards
there
was
this
disturbing
thing
about
the
gully
that
it
went
in
steps
and
before
each
step
one
saw
the
sky
just
a
yard
or
two
ahead
one
lost
the
comforting
sight
of
earth
one
knew
of
course
that
it
would
only
be
a
little
drop
and
that
the
slope
would
begin
again
but
it
disturbed
one
and
it
is
a
trial
to
drop
or
clamber
down
say
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
sometimes
twenty
and
then
to
find
no
flat
foothold
but
that
eternal
steep
beginning
again
and
this
outline
in
which
i
have
somewhat
but
not
much
exaggerated
the
slope
will
show
what
i
mean
the
dotted
line
is
the
line
of
vision
just
as
one
got
to
a
the
little
figure
is
auctor
lector
is
up
in
the
air
looking
at
him
observe
the
perspective
of
the
lake
below
but
make
no
comments
i
went
very
slowly
when
i
was
about
down
and
had
come
to
a
place
where
a
shoulder
of
heaped
rock
stood
on
my
left
and
where
little
parallel
ledges
led
up
to
it
having
grown
accustomed
to
the
descent
and
easier
in
my
mind
i
sat
down
on
a
slab
and
drew
imperfectly
the
things
i
saw
the
lake
below
me
the
first
forests
clinging
to
the
foot
of
the
alps
beyond
their
higher
slopes
of
snow
and
the
clouds
that
had
now
begun
to
gather
round
them
and
that
altogether
hid
the
last
third
of
their
enormous
height
then
i
saw
a
steamer
on
the
lake
i
felt
in
touch
with
men
the
slope
grew
easier
i
snapped
my
fingers
at
the
great
devils
that
haunt
high
mountains
i
sniffed
the
gross
and
comfortable
air
of
the
lower
valleys
i
entered
the
belt
of
wood
and
was
soon
going
quite
a
pace
through
the
trees
for
i
had
found
a
path
and
was
now
able
to
sing
so
i
did
at
last
i
saw
through
the
trunks
but
a
few
hundred
feet
below
me
the
highroad
that
skirts
the
lake
i
left
the
path
and
scrambled
straight
down
to
it
i
came
to
a
wall
which
i
climbed
and
found
myself
in
somebody
garden
crossing
this
and
admiring
its
wealth
and
order
i
was
careful
not
to
walk
on
the
lawns
i
opened
a
little
private
gate
and
came
on
to
the
road
and
from
there
to
brienz
was
but
a
short
way
along
a
fine
hard
surface
in
a
hot
morning
sun
with
the
gentle
lake
on
my
right
hand
not
five
yards
away
and
with
delightful
trees
upon
my
left
caressing
and
sometimes
even
covering
me
with
their
shade
i
was
therefore
dry
ready
and
contented
when
i
entered
by
mid
morning
the
curious
town
of
brienz
which
is
all
one
long
street
and
of
which
the
population
is
protestant
i
say
dry
ready
and
contented
dry
in
my
clothes
ready
for
food
contented
with
men
and
nature
but
as
i
entered
i
squinted
up
that
interminable
slope
i
saw
the
fog
wreathing
again
along
the
ridge
so
infinitely
above
me
and
i
considered
myself
a
fool
to
have
crossed
the
brienzer
grat
without
breakfast
but
i
could
get
no
one
in
brienz
to
agree
with
me
because
no
one
thought
i
had
done
it
though
several
people
there
could
talk
french
the
grimsel
pass
is
the
valley
of
the
aar
it
is
also
the
eastern
flank
of
that
great
or
bulk
and
mass
of
mountains
called
the
bernese
oberland
western
switzerland
you
must
know
is
not
as
i
first
thought
it
was
when
i
gazed
down
from
the
weissenstein
a
plain
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
mountains
but
rather
it
is
a
plain
in
its
northern
half
the
plain
of
the
lower
aar
and
in
its
southern
half
it
is
two
enormous
parallel
lumps
of
mountains
i
call
them
because
they
are
so
very
broad
and
tortuous
in
their
plan
that
they
are
hardly
ranges
now
these
two
lumps
are
the
bernese
oberland
and
the
pennine
alps
and
between
them
runs
a
deep
trench
called
the
valley
of
the
rhone
take
mont
blanc
in
the
west
and
a
peak
called
the
crystal
peak
over
the
val
bavona
on
the
east
and
they
are
the
flanking
bastions
of
one
great
wall
the
pennine
alps
take
the
diablerets
on
the
west
and
the
wetterhorn
on
the
east
and
they
are
the
flanking
bastions
of
another
great
wall
the
bernese
oberland
and
these
two
walls
are
parallel
with
the
rhone
in
between
now
these
two
walls
converge
at
a
point
where
there
is
a
sort
of
knot
of
mountain
ridges
and
this
point
may
be
taken
as
being
on
the
boundary
between
eastern
and
western
switzerland
at
this
wonderful
point
the
ticino
the
rhone
the
aar
and
the
reuss
all
begin
and
it
is
here
that
the
simple
arrangement
of
the
alps
to
the
west
turns
into
the
confused
jumble
of
the
alps
to
the
east
when
you
are
high
up
on
either
wall
you
can
catch
the
plan
of
all
this
but
to
avoid
a
confused
description
and
to
help
you
to
follow
the
marvellous
hannibalian
and
charge
and
march
which
i
made
and
which
alas
ended
only
in
a
glorious
defeat
to
help
you
to
picture
faintly
to
yourselves
the
mirific
and
horripilant
adventure
whereby
i
nearly
achieved
superhuman
success
in
spite
of
all
the
powers
of
the
air
i
append
a
little
map
which
is
rough
but
clear
and
plain
and
which
i
beg
you
to
study
closely
for
it
will
make
it
easy
for
you
to
understand
what
next
happened
in
my
pilgrimage
the
dark
strips
are
the
deep
cloven
valleys
the
shaded
belt
is
that
higher
land
which
is
yet
passable
by
any
ordinary
man
the
part
left
white
you
may
take
to
be
the
very
high
fields
of
ice
and
snow
with
great
peaks
which
an
ordinary
man
must
regard
as
impassable
unless
indeed
he
can
wait
for
his
weather
and
take
guides
and
go
on
as
a
tourist
instead
of
a
pilgrim
you
will
observe
that
i
have
marked
five
clefts
or
valleys
a
is
that
of
the
and
the
little
white
patch
at
the
beginning
is
the
lake
of
brienz
b
is
that
of
the
c
is
that
of
the
and
all
these
three
are
of
the
great
watershed
or
main
chain
and
all
three
are
full
of
people
on
the
other
hand
d
is
the
valley
of
the
e
of
the
and
f
of
the
all
these
three
are
of
the
great
watershed
and
are
inhabited
by
people
all
these
three
lead
down
at
last
to
lake
major
and
so
to
milan
and
so
to
rome
the
straight
line
to
rome
is
marked
on
my
map
by
a
dotted
line
ending
in
an
arrow
and
you
will
see
that
it
was
just
my
luck
that
it
should
cross
slap
over
that
knot
or
tangle
of
ranges
where
all
the
rivers
spring
the
problem
was
how
to
negotiate
a
passage
from
the
valley
of
the
aar
to
one
of
the
three
italian
valleys
without
departing
too
far
from
my
straight
line
to
explain
my
track
i
must
give
the
names
of
all
the
high
passes
between
the
valleys
that
between
a
and
c
is
called
the
that
between
b
and
c
the
that
between
d
and
c
is
the
pass
that
between
f
and
c
the
and
that
between
e
and
f
is
not
the
easy
thing
it
looks
on
the
map
indeed
it
is
hardly
a
pass
at
all
but
a
scramble
over
very
high
peaks
and
it
is
called
the
crystalline
mountain
finally
on
the
far
right
of
my
map
you
see
a
high
passage
between
b
and
this
is
the
famous
st
gothard
the
straightest
way
of
all
was
over
the
then
the
moment
i
got
into
the
valley
of
the
rhone
up
out
of
it
again
over
the
then
the
moment
i
was
down
into
the
valley
of
the
f
up
out
of
it
again
over
the
crystalline
to
the
valley
of
the
e
once
in
the
maggia
valley
the
top
of
it
is
called
the
bavona
it
is
a
straight
path
for
the
lakes
and
rome
there
were
also
these
advantages
that
i
should
be
in
a
place
very
rarely
visited
all
the
are
doubtful
on
it
that
i
should
be
going
quite
straight
that
i
should
be
accomplishing
a
feat
viz
the
crossing
of
those
high
passes
one
after
the
other
and
you
must
remember
that
over
the
nufenen
there
is
no
road
at
all
but
every
one
i
asked
told
me
that
thus
early
in
the
year
it
was
not
the
middle
of
june
i
could
not
hope
to
scramble
over
the
crystalline
no
one
they
said
could
do
it
and
live
it
was
all
ice
and
snow
and
cold
mist
and
verglas
and
the
precipices
were
smooth
a
man
would
never
get
across
so
it
was
not
worth
while
crossing
the
nufenen
pass
if
i
was
to
be
balked
at
the
crystal
and
i
determined
on
the
gries
pass
i
said
to
myself
will
go
on
over
the
grimsel
and
once
in
the
valley
of
the
rhone
i
will
walk
a
mile
or
two
down
to
where
the
gries
pass
opens
and
i
will
go
over
it
into
italy
for
the
gries
pass
though
not
quite
in
the
straight
line
had
this
advantage
that
once
over
it
you
are
really
in
italy
in
the
ticino
valley
or
in
the
val
bavona
though
the
people
are
as
italian
as
catullus
yet
politically
they
count
as
part
of
switzerland
and
therefore
if
you
enter
italy
thereby
you
are
not
suddenly
introduced
to
that
country
but
as
it
were
inoculated
and
led
on
by
degrees
which
is
a
pity
for
good
things
should
come
suddenly
like
the
demise
of
that
wicked
man
mr
deleted
by
the
censor
who
had
oppressed
the
poor
for
some
forty
years
when
he
was
shot
dead
from
behind
a
hedge
and
died
in
about
the
time
it
takes
to
boil
an
egg
and
there
was
an
end
of
him
having
made
myself
quite
clear
that
i
had
a
formed
plan
to
go
over
the
grimsel
by
the
new
road
then
up
over
the
gries
where
there
is
no
road
at
all
and
so
down
into
the
vale
of
the
tosa
and
having
calculated
that
on
the
morrow
i
should
be
in
italy
i
started
out
from
brienz
after
eating
a
great
meal
it
being
then
about
midday
and
i
having
already
as
you
know
crossed
the
brienzer
grat
since
dawn
the
task
of
that
afternoon
was
more
than
i
could
properly
undertake
nor
did
i
fulfil
it
from
brienz
to
the
top
of
the
grimsel
is
as
the
crow
flies
quite
twenty
miles
and
by
the
road
a
good
it
is
true
i
had
only
come
from
over
the
high
hills
perhaps
six
miles
in
a
straight
line
but
what
a
six
miles
and
all
without
food
not
certain
therefore
how
much
of
the
pass
i
could
really
do
that
day
but
aiming
at
crossing
it
like
a
fool
i
went
on
up
the
first
miles
for
an
hour
or
more
after
brienz
the
road
runs
round
the
base
of
and
then
away
from
a
fine
great
rock
there
is
here
an
alluvial
plain
like
a
continuation
of
the
lake
and
the
aar
runs
through
it
canalized
and
banked
and
straight
and
at
last
the
road
also
becomes
straight
on
either
side
rise
gigantic
cliffs
enclosing
the
valley
and
on
the
day
i
passed
there
going
up
into
the
clouds
which
though
high
yet
made
a
roof
for
the
valley
from
the
great
mountains
on
the
left
the
noble
rock
jutted
out
alone
and
dominated
the
little
plain
on
the
right
the
buttresses
of
the
main
alps
all
stood
in
a
row
and
between
them
went
whorls
of
vapour
high
high
up
just
above
the
places
where
snow
still
clung
to
the
slopes
these
whorls
made
the
utmost
steeps
more
and
more
misty
till
at
last
they
were
lost
in
a
kind
of
great
darkness
in
which
the
last
and
highest
banks
of
ice
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
i
often
stopped
to
gaze
straight
above
me
and
i
marvelled
at
the
silence
it
was
the
first
part
of
the
afternoon
when
i
got
to
a
place
called
meiringen
and
i
thought
that
there
i
would
eat
and
drink
a
little
more
so
i
steered
into
the
main
street
but
there
i
found
such
a
yelling
and
roaring
as
i
had
never
heard
before
and
very
damnable
it
was
as
though
men
were
determined
to
do
common
evil
wherever
god
has
given
them
a
chance
of
living
in
awe
and
worship
for
they
were
all
bawling
and
howling
with
great
placards
and
tickets
and
saying
way
to
the
extraordinary
waterfall
that
way
to
the
strange
cave
come
with
me
and
you
shall
see
the
falls
of
the
aar
and
so
forth
so
that
my
illusion
of
being
alone
in
the
roots
of
the
world
dropped
off
me
very
quickly
and
i
wondered
how
people
could
be
so
helpless
and
foolish
as
to
travel
about
in
switzerland
as
tourists
and
meet
with
all
this
vulgarity
and
beastliness
if
a
man
goes
to
drink
good
wine
he
does
not
say
that
the
wine
be
good
i
do
not
mind
eating
strong
pepper
and
smelling
hartshorn
as
i
drink
it
and
if
a
man
goes
to
read
a
good
verse
for
instance
jean
richepin
he
does
not
say
on
playing
on
the
trombone
go
on
banging
the
cymbals
so
long
as
i
am
reading
good
verse
i
am
content
yet
men
now
go
into
the
vast
hills
and
sleep
and
live
in
their
recesses
and
pretend
to
be
indifferent
to
all
the
touts
and
shouters
and
hurry
and
hotels
and
high
prices
and
abominations
thank
god
it
goes
in
grooves
i
say
it
again
thank
god
the
railways
are
trenches
that
drain
our
modern
marsh
for
you
have
but
to
avoid
railways
even
by
five
miles
and
you
can
get
more
peace
than
would
fill
a
nosebag
all
the
world
is
my
garden
since
they
built
railways
and
gave
me
leave
to
keep
off
them
also
i
vowed
a
franc
to
the
black
virgin
of
la
delivrande
next
time
i
should
be
passing
there
because
i
was
delivered
from
being
a
tourist
and
because
all
this
horrible
noise
was
not
being
dinned
at
me
who
was
a
poor
and
dirty
pilgrim
and
no
kind
of
prey
for
these
cabmen
and
busmen
and
guides
and
couriers
but
at
a
crowd
of
drawn
sad
jaded
tourists
that
had
come
in
by
a
train
soon
i
had
left
them
behind
the
road
climbed
the
first
step
upwards
in
the
valley
going
round
a
rock
on
the
other
side
of
which
the
aar
had
cut
itself
a
gorge
and
rushed
in
a
fall
and
rapids
then
the
road
went
on
and
on
weary
mile
after
weary
mile
and
i
stuck
to
it
and
it
rose
slowly
all
the
time
and
all
the
time
the
aar
went
dashing
by
roaring
and
filling
the
higher
valley
with
echoes
i
got
beyond
the
villages
the
light
shining
suffused
through
the
upper
mist
began
to
be
the
light
of
evening
rain
very
fine
and
slight
began
to
fall
it
was
cold
there
met
and
passed
me
going
down
the
road
a
carriage
with
a
hood
up
driving
at
full
speed
it
could
not
be
from
over
the
pass
for
i
knew
that
it
was
not
yet
open
for
carriages
or
carts
it
was
therefore
from
a
hotel
somewhere
and
if
there
was
a
hotel
i
should
find
it
i
looked
back
to
ask
the
distance
but
they
were
beyond
earshot
and
so
i
went
on
my
boots
in
which
i
had
sworn
to
walk
to
rome
were
ruinous
already
since
the
weissenstein
they
had
gaped
and
now
the
brienzer
grat
had
made
the
sole
of
one
of
them
quite
free
at
the
toe
it
flapped
as
i
walked
very
soon
i
should
be
walking
on
my
uppers
i
limped
also
and
i
hated
the
wet
cold
rain
but
i
had
to
go
on
instead
of
flourishing
my
staff
and
singing
i
leant
on
it
painfully
and
thought
of
duty
and
death
and
dereliction
and
every
other
horrible
thing
that
begins
with
a
i
had
to
go
on
if
i
had
gone
back
there
was
nothing
for
miles
before
it
was
dark
indeed
one
could
still
read
i
saw
a
group
of
houses
beyond
the
aar
and
soon
after
i
saw
that
my
road
would
pass
them
going
over
a
bridge
when
i
reached
them
i
went
into
the
first
saying
to
myself
will
eat
and
if
i
can
go
no
farther
i
will
sleep
here
there
were
in
the
house
two
women
one
old
the
other
young
and
they
were
from
the
vaud
country
they
had
faces
like
scotch
people
and
were
very
kindly
but
odd
being
calvinist
i
said
you
any
beans
they
said
i
suggested
they
should
make
me
a
dish
of
beans
and
bacon
and
give
me
a
bottle
of
wine
while
i
dried
myself
at
their
great
stove
all
this
they
readily
did
for
me
and
i
ate
heartily
and
drank
heavily
and
they
begged
me
afterwards
to
stop
the
night
and
pay
them
for
it
but
i
was
so
set
up
by
my
food
and
wine
that
i
excused
myself
and
went
out
again
and
took
the
road
it
was
not
yet
dark
by
some
reflection
from
the
fields
of
snow
which
were
now
quite
near
at
hand
through
the
mist
the
daylight
lingered
astonishingly
late
the
cold
grew
bitter
as
i
went
on
through
the
gloaming
there
were
no
trees
save
rare
and
stunted
pines
the
aar
was
a
shallow
brawling
torrent
thick
with
melting
ice
and
snow
and
mud
coarse
grass
grew
on
the
rocks
sparsely
there
were
no
flowers
the
mist
overhead
was
now
quite
near
and
i
still
went
on
and
steadily
up
through
the
it
was
as
lonely
as
a
calm
at
sea
except
for
the
noise
of
the
river
i
had
overworn
myself
and
that
sustaining
surface
which
hides
from
us
in
our
health
the
abysses
below
the
mind
i
felt
it
growing
weak
and
thin
my
fatigue
bewildered
me
the
occasional
steeps
beside
the
road
one
especially
beneath
a
high
bridge
where
a
tributary
falls
into
the
aar
in
a
cascade
terrified
me
they
were
like
the
emptiness
of
dreams
at
last
it
being
now
dark
and
i
having
long
since
entered
the
upper
mist
or
rather
cloud
for
i
was
now
as
high
as
the
clouds
i
saw
a
light
gleaming
through
the
fog
just
off
the
road
through
it
was
time
i
could
not
have
gone
much
farther
to
this
i
turned
and
found
there
one
of
those
new
hotels
not
very
large
but
very
expensive
they
knew
me
at
once
for
what
i
was
and
welcomed
me
with
joy
they
gave
me
hot
rum
and
sugar
a
fine
warm
bed
told
me
i
was
the
first
that
had
yet
stopped
there
that
year
and
left
me
to
sleep
very
deep
and
yet
in
pain
as
men
sleep
who
are
stunned
but
twice
that
night
i
woke
suddenly
staring
at
darkness
i
had
outworn
the
physical
network
upon
which
the
soul
depends
and
i
was
full
of
terrors
next
morning
i
had
fine
coffee
and
bread
and
butter
and
the
rest
like
a
rich
man
in
a
gilded
all
set
out
for
the
rich
and
served
by
a
fellow
that
bowed
and
scraped
also
they
made
me
pay
a
great
deal
and
kept
their
eyes
off
my
boots
and
were
still
courteous
to
me
and
i
to
them
then
i
bought
wine
of
them
the
first
wine
not
of
the
country
that
i
had
drunk
on
this
march
a
burgundy
and
putting
it
in
my
haversack
with
a
nice
white
roll
left
them
to
wait
for
the
next
man
whom
the
hills
might
send
them
the
clouds
the
mist
were
denser
than
ever
in
that
early
morning
one
could
only
see
the
immediate
road
the
cold
was
very
great
my
clothes
were
not
quite
dried
but
my
heart
was
high
and
i
pushed
along
well
enough
though
stiffly
till
i
came
to
what
they
call
the
hospice
which
was
once
a
i
suppose
but
is
now
an
inn
i
had
brandy
there
and
on
going
out
i
found
that
it
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
sharp
ridge
which
was
the
true
grimsel
pass
the
neck
which
joins
the
bernese
oberland
to
the
eastern
group
of
high
mountains
this
ridge
or
neck
was
steep
like
a
pitched
roof
very
high
i
found
it
and
all
of
black
glassy
rock
with
here
and
there
snow
in
sharp
even
sloping
sheets
just
holding
to
it
i
could
see
but
little
of
it
at
a
time
on
account
of
the
mist
hitherto
for
all
these
miles
the
aar
had
been
my
companion
and
the
road
though
rising
always
had
risen
evenly
and
not
steeply
now
the
aar
was
left
behind
in
the
icy
glen
where
it
rises
and
the
road
went
in
an
artificial
and
carefully
built
set
of
up
the
face
of
the
cliff
there
is
a
short
cut
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
the
mist
it
is
the
old
here
and
there
however
it
was
possible
to
cut
off
long
corners
by
scrambling
over
the
steep
black
rock
and
smooth
ice
and
all
the
while
the
cold
soft
mist
wisped
in
and
out
around
me
after
a
thousand
feet
of
this
i
came
to
the
top
of
the
grimsel
but
not
before
i
had
passed
a
place
where
an
avalanche
had
destroyed
the
road
and
where
planks
were
laid
also
before
one
got
to
the
very
summit
no
short
cuts
or
climbing
were
possible
the
road
ran
deep
in
a
cutting
like
a
devonshire
lane
only
here
the
high
banks
were
solid
snow
some
little
way
past
the
summit
on
the
first
down
i
passed
the
lake
of
the
dead
in
its
mournful
hollow
the
mist
still
enveloped
all
the
and
moved
like
a
press
of
spirits
over
the
frozen
water
then
as
suddenly
as
on
the
much
lower
brienzer
grat
and
as
on
the
brienzer
grat
to
the
southward
and
the
sun
the
clouds
lifted
and
wreathed
up
backward
and
were
gone
and
where
there
had
just
been
fulness
was
only
an
immensity
of
empty
air
and
a
sudden
sight
of
clear
hills
beyond
and
of
little
strange
distant
things
thousands
and
thousands
of
feet
below
lector
pray
are
we
to
have
any
more
of
that
fine
writing
auctor
i
saw
there
as
in
a
cup
things
that
i
had
thought
when
i
first
studied
the
map
at
home
far
too
spacious
and
spread
apart
to
go
into
the
view
yet
here
they
were
all
quite
contained
and
close
together
on
so
vast
a
scale
was
the
whole
place
conceived
it
was
the
comb
of
mountains
of
which
i
have
written
the
meeting
of
all
the
valleys
there
from
the
height
of
a
steep
bank
as
it
were
but
a
bank
many
thousands
of
feet
high
one
looked
down
into
a
whole
district
or
little
world
on
the
map
i
say
it
had
seemed
so
great
that
i
had
thought
one
would
command
but
this
or
that
portion
of
it
as
it
was
one
saw
it
all
and
this
is
a
peculiar
thing
i
have
noticed
in
all
mountains
and
have
never
been
able
to
understand
namely
that
if
you
draw
a
plan
or
section
to
scale
your
mountain
does
not
seem
a
very
important
thing
one
should
not
in
theory
be
able
to
dominate
from
its
height
nor
to
feel
the
world
small
below
one
nor
to
hold
a
whole
countryside
in
one
hand
yet
one
does
the
mountains
from
their
heights
reveal
to
us
two
truths
they
suddenly
make
us
feel
our
insignificance
and
at
the
same
time
they
free
the
immortal
mind
and
let
it
feel
its
greatness
and
they
release
it
from
the
earth
but
i
say
again
in
theory
when
one
considers
the
exact
relation
of
their
height
to
the
distances
one
views
from
them
they
ought
to
claim
no
such
effect
and
that
they
can
produce
that
effect
is
related
to
another
thing
the
way
in
which
they
exaggerate
their
own
steepness
for
instance
those
noble
hills
my
downs
in
sussex
when
you
are
upon
them
overlooking
the
weald
from
chanctonbury
say
feel
like
this
or
even
lower
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
give
them
truly
so
insignificant
are
they
if
the
stretch
of
the
weald
were
made
nearly
a
yard
long
chanctonbury
would
not
in
proportion
be
more
than
a
fifth
of
an
inch
high
and
yet
from
the
top
of
chanctonbury
how
one
seems
to
overlook
it
and
possess
it
all
well
so
it
was
here
from
the
grimsel
when
i
overlooked
the
springs
of
the
rhone
in
true
proportion
the
valley
i
gazed
into
and
over
must
have
been
somewhat
like
this
it
felt
for
all
the
world
as
deep
and
utterly
below
me
as
this
other
moreover
where
there
was
no
mist
the
air
was
so
surprisingly
clear
that
i
could
see
everything
clean
and
sharp
wherever
i
turned
my
eyes
the
mountains
forbade
any
very
far
horizons
to
the
view
and
all
that
i
could
see
was
as
neat
and
vivid
as
those
coloured
photographs
they
sell
with
bright
green
grass
and
bright
white
snow
and
blue
glaciers
like
precious
stones
i
scrambled
down
the
mountain
for
here
on
the
south
side
of
the
pass
there
was
no
snow
or
ice
and
it
was
quite
easy
to
leave
the
road
and
take
the
old
path
cutting
off
the
as
the
air
got
heavier
i
became
hungry
and
at
the
very
end
of
my
descent
two
hundred
feet
or
so
above
the
young
rhone
i
saw
a
great
hotel
i
went
round
to
their
front
door
and
asked
them
whether
i
could
eat
and
at
what
price
francs
they
said
said
i
francs
for
a
meal
come
let
me
eat
in
the
kitchen
and
charge
me
one
but
they
became
rude
and
obstinate
being
used
only
to
deal
with
rich
people
so
i
cursed
them
and
went
down
the
road
but
i
was
very
hungry
the
road
falls
quite
steeply
and
the
rhone
which
it
accompanies
in
that
valley
leaps
in
little
falls
on
a
bridge
i
passed
a
sad
englishman
reading
a
book
and
a
little
lower
down
two
american
women
in
a
carriage
and
after
that
a
priest
it
was
lucky
i
did
not
see
him
first
anyhow
i
touched
iron
at
once
to
wit
a
key
in
my
pocket
and
after
that
a
child
minding
a
goat
altogether
i
felt
myself
in
the
world
again
and
as
i
was
on
a
good
road
all
down
hill
i
thought
myself
capable
of
pushing
on
to
the
next
village
but
my
hunger
was
really
excessive
my
right
boot
almost
gone
and
my
left
boot
nothing
to
exhibit
or
boast
of
when
i
came
to
a
point
where
at
last
one
looked
down
the
rhone
valley
for
miles
it
is
like
a
straight
trench
and
at
intervals
there
are
little
villages
built
of
most
filthy
chalets
the
said
chalets
raised
on
great
stones
there
are
up
up
on
either
slope
into
the
clouds
and
beyond
the
clouds
i
could
not
see
i
left
on
my
left
a
village
called
the
waters
i
passed
through
another
called
but
it
has
no
inn
at
last
two
miles
farther
faint
from
lack
of
food
i
got
into
ulrichen
a
village
a
little
larger
than
the
rest
and
the
place
where
i
believed
one
should
start
to
go
either
over
the
gries
or
nufenen
pass
in
ulrichen
was
a
warm
wooden
frousty
comfortable
ramshackle
dark
anyhow
kind
of
a
little
inn
called
bear
and
entering
i
saw
one
of
the
women
whom
god
loves
she
was
of
middle
age
very
honest
and
simple
in
the
face
kindly
and
good
she
was
messing
about
with
cooking
and
stuff
and
she
came
up
to
me
stooping
a
little
her
eyes
wide
and
innocent
and
a
great
spoon
in
her
hand
her
face
was
extremely
broad
and
flat
and
i
have
never
seen
eyes
set
so
far
apart
her
whole
gait
manner
and
accent
proved
her
to
be
extremely
good
and
on
the
straight
road
to
heaven
i
saluted
her
in
the
french
tongue
she
answered
me
in
the
same
but
very
broken
and
rustic
for
her
natural
speech
was
a
kind
of
mountain
german
she
spoke
very
slowly
and
had
a
nice
soft
voice
and
she
did
what
only
good
people
do
i
mean
looked
you
in
the
eyes
as
she
spoke
to
you
beware
of
people
it
is
not
only
nervousness
it
is
also
a
kind
of
wickedness
such
people
come
to
no
good
i
have
three
of
them
now
in
my
mind
as
i
write
one
is
a
professor
and
by
the
way
would
you
like
to
know
why
universities
suffer
from
this
curse
of
nervous
disease
why
the
great
personages
stammer
or
have
st
vitus
dance
or
jabber
at
the
lips
or
hop
in
their
walk
or
have
their
heads
screwed
round
or
tremble
in
the
fingers
or
go
through
life
with
great
goggles
like
a
motor
car
eh
i
will
tell
you
it
is
the
punishment
of
their
pride
than
which
no
sin
is
more
offensive
to
the
angels
what
here
are
we
with
the
jolly
world
of
god
all
round
us
able
to
sing
to
draw
to
paint
to
hammer
and
build
to
sail
to
ride
horses
to
run
to
leap
having
for
our
splendid
inheritance
love
in
youth
and
memory
in
old
age
and
we
are
to
take
one
miserable
little
faculty
our
gimcrack
purblind
underfed
and
perpetually
irritated
and
grumpy
intellect
or
analytical
curiosity
rather
a
diseased
appetite
and
let
it
swell
till
it
eats
up
every
other

lector
pray
pray
return
to
the
woman
at
the
inn
auctor
i
will
and
by
this
road
to
say
that
on
the
day
of
judgement
when
st
michael
weighs
souls
in
his
scales
and
the
wicked
are
led
off
by
the
devil
with
a
great
rope
as
you
may
see
them
over
the
main
porch
of
notre
dame
i
will
heave
a
stone
after
them
myself
i
hope
all
the
souls
of
the
pedants
together
will
not
weigh
as
heavy
and
sound
as
the
one
soul
of
this
good
woman
at
the
inn
she
put
food
before
me
and
wine
the
wine
was
good
but
in
the
food
was
some
fearful
herb
or
other
i
had
never
tasted
before
a
pure
spice
or
scent
and
a
nasty
one
one
could
taste
nothing
else
and
it
was
revolting
but
i
ate
it
for
her
sake
then
very
much
refreshed
i
rose
seized
my
great
staff
shook
myself
and
said
it
is
about
noon
and
i
am
off
for
the
frontier
at
this
she
made
a
most
fearful
clamour
saying
that
it
was
madness
and
imploring
me
not
to
think
of
it
and
running
out
fetched
from
the
stable
a
tall
sad
man
who
saluted
me
profoundly
and
told
me
that
he
knew
more
of
the
mountains
than
any
one
for
miles
and
this
by
asking
many
afterwards
i
found
out
to
be
true
he
said
that
he
had
crossed
the
nufenen
and
the
gries
whenever
they
could
be
crossed
since
he
was
a
child
and
that
if
i
attempted
it
that
day
i
should
sleep
that
night
in
paradise
the
clouds
on
the
mountain
the
soft
snow
recently
fallen
the
rain
that
now
occupied
the
valleys
the
glacier
on
the
gries
and
the
pathless
snow
in
the
mist
on
the
nufenen
would
make
it
sheer
suicide
for
him
an
experienced
guide
and
for
me
a
worse
madness
also
he
spoke
of
my
boots
and
wondered
at
my
poor
coat
and
trousers
and
threatened
me
with
intolerable
cold
it
seems
that
the
books
i
had
read
at
home
when
they
said
that
the
nufenen
had
no
snow
on
it
spoke
of
a
later
season
of
the
year
it
was
all
snow
now
and
soft
snow
and
hidden
by
a
full
mist
in
such
a
day
from
the
first
third
of
the
ascent
as
for
the
gries
there
was
a
glacier
on
the
top
which
needed
some
kind
of
clearness
in
the
weather
hearing
all
this
i
said
i
would
remain
but
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
already
i
felt
a
shadow
of
defeat
over
me
the
loss
of
time
was
a
thorn
i
was
already
short
of
cash
and
my
next
money
was
milan
my
return
to
england
was
fixed
for
a
certain
date
and
stronger
than
either
of
these
motives
against
delay
was
a
burning
restlessness
that
always
takes
men
when
they
are
on
the
way
to
great
adventures
i
made
him
promise
to
wake
me
next
morning
at
three
and
short
of
a
tempest
to
try
and
get
me
across
the
gries
as
for
the
nufenen
and
crystalline
passes
which
i
had
desired
to
attempt
and
which
were
as
i
have
said
the
straight
line
to
rome
he
said
and
he
was
right
that
let
alone
the
impassability
of
the
nufenen
just
then
to
climb
the
crystal
mountain
in
that
season
would
be
as
easy
as
flying
to
the
moon
now
to
cross
the
nufenen
alone
would
simply
land
me
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
ticino
and
take
me
a
great
bend
out
of
my
way
by
bellinzona
hence
my
bargain
that
at
least
he
should
show
me
over
the
gries
pass
and
this
he
said
if
man
could
do
it
he
would
do
the
next
day
and
i
sending
my
boots
to
be
cobbled
and
thereby
breaking
another
vow
crept
up
to
bed
and
all
afternoon
read
the
of
the
children
they
were
in
french
from
lower
down
the
valley
and
very
genevese
and
heretical
for
so
devout
a
household
but
the
genevese
civilization
is
the
standard
for
these
people
and
they
combat
the
calvinism
of
it
with
missions
and
have
statues
in
their
rooms
not
to
speak
of
holy
water
stoups
the
rain
beat
on
my
window
the
clouds
came
lower
still
down
the
mountain
then
as
is
finely
written
in
the
song
of
roland
day
passed
and
the
night
came
and
i
slept
but
with
the
coming
of
the
small
hours
and
with
my
waking
prepare
yourselves
for
the
most
extraordinary
and
terrible
adventure
that
befell
me
out
of
all
the
marvels
and
perils
of
this
pilgrimage
the
most
momentous
and
the
most
worthy
of
perpetual
record
i
think
of
all
that
has
ever
happened
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
at
three
the
guide
knocked
at
my
door
and
i
rose
and
came
out
to
him
we
drank
coffee
and
ate
bread
we
put
into
our
sacks
ham
and
bread
and
he
white
wine
and
i
brandy
then
we
set
out
the
rain
had
dropped
to
a
drizzle
and
there
was
no
wind
the
sky
was
obscured
for
the
most
part
but
here
and
there
was
a
star
the
hills
hung
awfully
above
us
in
the
night
as
we
crossed
the
spongy
valley
a
little
wooden
bridge
took
us
over
the
young
rhone
here
only
a
stream
and
we
followed
a
path
up
into
the
tributary
ravine
which
leads
to
the
nufenen
and
the
gries
in
a
mile
or
two
it
was
a
little
lighter
and
this
was
as
well
for
some
weeks
before
a
great
avalanche
had
fallen
and
we
had
to
cross
it
gingerly
beneath
the
wide
cap
of
frozen
snow
ran
a
torrent
roaring
i
remembered
colorado
and
how
i
had
crossed
the
arkansaw
on
such
a
bridge
as
a
boy
we
went
on
in
the
uneasy
dawn
the
woods
began
to
show
and
there
was
a
cross
where
a
man
had
slipped
from
above
that
very
april
and
been
killed
then
most
ominous
and
disturbing
the
drizzle
changed
to
a
rain
and
the
guide
shook
his
head
and
said
it
would
be
snowing
higher
up
we
went
on
and
it
grew
lighter
before
it
was
really
day
or
else
the
weather
confused
and
darkened
the
sky
we
crossed
a
good
bridge
built
long
ago
and
we
halted
at
a
shed
where
the
cattle
lie
in
the
late
summer
when
the
snow
is
melted
there
we
rested
a
moment
but
on
leaving
its
shelter
we
noticed
many
disquieting
things
the
place
was
a
hollow
the
end
of
the
ravine
a
bowl
as
it
were
one
way
out
of
which
is
the
nufenen
and
the
other
the
gries
here
it
is
in
a
sketch
map
the
heights
are
marked
lighter
and
lighter
from
black
in
the
valleys
to
white
in
the
impassable
mountains
e
is
where
we
stood
in
a
great
cup
or
basin
having
just
come
up
the
ravine
b
c
is
the
italian
valley
of
the
tosa
and
the
neck
between
it
and
e
is
the
gries
d
is
the
valley
of
the
ticino
and
the
neck
between
e
and
it
is
the
nufenen
a
is
the
crystal
mountain
you
may
take
the
necks
or
passes
to
be
about
and
the
mountains
or
feet
above
the
sea
we
noticed
i
say
many
disquieting
things
first
all
that
bowl
or
cup
below
the
passes
was
a
carpet
of
snow
save
where
patches
of
black
water
showed
and
all
the
passes
and
mountains
from
top
to
bottom
were
covered
with
very
thick
snow
the
deep
surface
of
it
soft
and
fresh
fallen
secondly
the
rain
had
turned
into
snow
it
was
falling
thickly
all
around
nowhere
have
i
more
perceived
the
immediate
presence
of
great
death
thirdly
it
was
far
colder
and
we
felt
the
beginning
of
a
wind
fourthly
the
clouds
had
come
quite
low
down
the
guide
said
it
could
not
be
done
but
i
said
we
must
attempt
it
i
was
eager
and
had
not
yet
felt
the
awful
grip
of
the
cold
we
left
the
nufenen
on
our
left
a
hopeless
steep
of
new
snow
buried
in
fog
and
we
attacked
the
gries
for
we
plunged
on
through
snow
above
our
knees
and
my
thin
cotton
clothes
were
soaked
so
far
the
guide
knew
we
were
more
or
less
on
the
path
and
he
went
on
and
i
panted
after
him
neither
of
us
spoke
but
occasionally
he
looked
back
to
make
sure
i
had
not
dropped
out
the
snow
began
to
fall
more
thickly
and
the
wind
had
risen
somewhat
i
was
afraid
of
another
protest
from
the
guide
but
he
stuck
to
it
well
and
i
after
him
continually
plunging
through
soft
snow
and
making
yard
after
yard
upwards
the
snow
fell
more
thickly
and
the
wind
still
rose
we
came
to
a
place
which
is
in
the
warm
season
an
alp
that
is
a
slope
of
grass
very
steep
but
not
terrifying
having
here
and
there
sharp
little
precipices
of
rock
breaking
it
into
steps
but
by
no
means
in
summer
a
matter
to
make
one
draw
back
now
however
when
everything
was
still
arctic
it
was
a
very
different
matter
a
sheer
steep
of
snow
whose
downward
plunge
ran
into
the
driving
storm
and
was
lost
whose
head
was
lost
in
the
same
mass
of
thick
cloud
above
a
slope
somewhat
hollowed
and
bent
inwards
had
to
be
crossed
if
we
were
to
go
any
farther
and
i
was
terrified
for
i
knew
nothing
of
climbing
the
guide
said
there
was
little
danger
only
if
one
slipped
one
might
slide
down
to
safety
or
one
might
much
less
probably
get
over
rocks
and
be
killed
i
was
chattering
a
little
with
cold
but
as
he
did
not
propose
a
return
i
followed
him
the
surface
was
alternately
slabs
of
frozen
snow
and
patches
of
soft
new
snow
in
the
first
he
cut
steps
in
the
second
we
plunged
and
once
i
went
right
in
and
a
mass
of
snow
broke
off
beneath
me
and
went
careering
down
the
slope
he
showed
me
how
to
hold
my
staff
backwards
as
he
did
his
alpenstock
and
use
it
as
a
kind
of
brake
in
case
i
slipped
we
had
been
about
twenty
minutes
crawling
over
that
wall
of
snow
and
ice
and
it
was
more
and
more
apparent
that
we
were
in
for
danger
before
we
had
quite
reached
the
far
side
the
wind
was
blowing
a
very
full
gale
and
roared
past
our
ears
the
surface
snow
was
whirring
furiously
like
dust
before
it
past
our
faces
and
against
them
drove
the
cutting
the
air
not
falling
but
making
straight
darts
and
streaks
they
seemed
like
the
form
of
the
whistling
wind
they
blinded
us
the
rocks
on
the
far
side
of
the
slope
rocks
which
had
been
our
goal
when
we
set
out
to
cross
it
had
long
ago
disappeared
in
the
increasing
rush
of
the
blizzard
suddenly
as
we
were
still
painfully
moving
on
stooping
against
the
mad
wind
these
rocks
loomed
up
over
as
large
as
houses
and
we
saw
them
through
the
swarming
as
great
hulls
are
seen
through
a
fog
at
sea
the
guide
crouched
under
the
lee
of
the
nearest
i
came
up
close
to
him
and
he
put
his
hands
to
my
ear
and
shouted
to
me
that
nothing
further
could
be
done
he
had
so
to
shout
because
in
among
the
rocks
the
hurricane
made
a
roaring
sound
swamping
the
voice
i
asked
how
far
we
were
from
the
summit
he
said
he
did
not
know
where
we
were
exactly
but
that
we
could
not
be
more
than
feet
from
it
i
was
but
that
from
italy
and
i
would
not
admit
defeat
i
offered
him
all
i
had
in
money
to
go
on
but
it
was
folly
in
me
because
if
i
had
had
enough
to
tempt
him
and
if
he
had
yielded
we
should
both
have
died
luckily
it
was
but
a
little
sum
he
shook
his
head
he
would
not
go
on
he
broke
out
for
all
the
money
there
was
in
the
world
he
shouted
me
to
eat
and
drink
and
so
we
both
did
then
i
understood
his
wisdom
for
in
a
little
while
the
cold
began
to
seize
me
in
my
thin
clothes
my
hands
were
numb
my
face
already
gave
me
intolerable
pain
and
my
legs
suffered
and
felt
heavy
i
learnt
another
thing
which
had
i
been
used
to
mountains
i
should
have
known
that
it
was
not
a
simple
thing
to
return
the
guide
was
hesitating
whether
to
stay
in
this
rough
shelter
or
to
face
the
chances
of
the
descent
this
terror
had
not
crossed
my
mind
and
i
thought
as
little
of
it
as
i
could
needing
my
courage
and
being
near
to
breaking
down
from
the
intensity
of
the
cold
it
seems
that
in
a
for
by
that
excellent
name
do
the
mountain
people
call
such
a
storm
it
is
always
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
to
halt
or
go
back
if
you
go
back
through
it
and
lose
your
way
you
are
done
for
if
you
halt
in
some
shelter
it
may
go
on
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
there
is
an
end
of
you
after
a
little
he
decided
for
a
return
but
he
told
me
honestly
what
the
chances
were
and
my
suffering
from
cold
mercifully
mitigated
my
fear
but
even
in
that
moment
i
felt
in
a
confused
but
very
conscious
way
that
i
was
defeated
i
had
crossed
so
many
great
hills
and
rivers
and
pressed
so
well
on
my
undeviating
to
rome
and
i
had
charged
this
one
great
barrier
manfully
where
the
straight
path
of
my
pilgrimage
crossed
the
alps
and
i
had
failed
even
in
that
fearful
cold
i
felt
it
and
it
ran
through
my
doubt
of
return
like
another
and
deeper
current
of
pain
italy
was
there
just
above
right
to
my
hand
a
lifting
of
a
cloud
a
little
respite
and
every
downward
step
would
have
been
towards
the
sunlight
as
it
was
i
was
being
driven
back
northward
in
retreat
and
ashamed
the
alps
had
conquered
me
let
us
always
after
this
combat
their
immensity
and
their
will
and
always
hate
the
inhuman
guards
that
hold
the
gates
of
italy
and
the
powers
that
lie
in
wait
for
men
on
those
high
places
but
now
i
know
that
italy
will
always
stand
apart
she
is
cut
off
by
no
ordinary
wall
and
death
has
all
his
army
on
her
frontiers
well
we
returned
twice
the
guide
rubbed
my
hands
with
brandy
and
once
i
had
to
halt
and
recover
for
a
moment
failing
and
losing
my
hold
believe
it
or
not
the
deep
footsteps
of
our
ascent
were
already
quite
lost
and
covered
by
the
new
snow
since
our
halt
and
even
had
they
been
visible
the
guide
would
not
have
retraced
them
he
did
what
i
did
not
at
first
understand
but
what
i
soon
saw
to
be
wise
he
took
a
steep
slant
downward
over
the
face
of
the
and
though
such
a
pitch
of
descent
a
little
unnerved
me
it
was
well
in
the
end
for
when
we
had
gone
down
perhaps
feet
or
a
thousand
in
perpendicular
distance
even
i
half
numb
and
fainting
could
feel
that
the
storm
was
less
violent
another
two
hundred
and
the
flakes
could
be
seen
not
driving
in
flashes
past
but
separately
falling
then
in
some
few
minutes
we
could
see
the
slope
for
a
very
long
way
downwards
quite
clearly
then
soon
after
we
saw
far
below
us
the
place
where
the
merged
easily
into
the
plain
of
that
cup
or
basin
whence
we
had
started
when
we
saw
this
the
guide
said
to
me
your
stick
thus
if
you
are
strong
enough
and
let
yourself
slide
i
could
just
hold
it
in
spite
of
the
cold
life
was
returning
to
me
with
intolerable
pain
we
shot
down
the
slope
almost
as
quickly
as
falling
but
it
was
evidently
safe
to
do
so
as
the
end
was
clearly
visible
and
had
no
break
or
rock
in
it
so
we
reached
the
plain
below
and
entered
the
little
shed
and
thence
looking
up
we
saw
the
storm
above
us
but
no
one
could
have
told
it
for
what
it
was
here
below
was
silence
and
the
terror
and
raging
above
seemed
only
a
great
trembling
cloud
occupying
the
mountain
then
we
set
our
faces
down
the
ravine
by
which
we
had
come
up
and
so
came
down
to
where
the
snow
changed
to
rain
when
we
got
right
down
into
the
valley
of
the
rhone
we
found
it
all
roofed
with
cloud
and
the
higher
trees
were
white
with
snow
making
a
line
like
a
tide
mark
on
the
slopes
of
the
hills
i
bear
silent
and
angered
and
not
accepting
the
humiliation
of
that
failure
then
having
eaten
i
determined
in
equal
silence
to
take
the
road
like
any
other
fool
to
cross
the
furka
by
a
fine
highroad
like
any
tourist
and
to
cross
the
st
gothard
by
another
fine
highroad
as
millions
had
done
before
me
and
not
to
look
heaven
in
the
face
again
till
i
was
back
after
my
long
detour
on
the
straight
road
again
for
rome
but
to
think
of
it
i
who
had
all
that
planned
out
and
had
so
nearly
done
it
i
who
had
cut
a
path
across
europe
like
a
shaft
and
seen
so
many
strange
places
now
to
have
to
recite
all
the
litany
of
the
vulgar
bellinzona
lugano
and
this
and
that
which
any
railway
travelling
fellow
can
tell
you
not
till
como
should
i
feel
a
man
again
indeed
it
is
a
bitter
thing
to
have
to
give
up
one
sword
i
had
not
the
money
to
wait
my
defeat
had
lowered
me
in
purse
as
well
as
in
heart
i
started
off
to
enter
by
the
ordinary
gates
not
italy
even
but
a
the
canton
of
the
ticino
it
was
very
hard
this
book
is
not
a
tragedy
and
i
will
not
write
at
any
length
of
such
pain
that
same
day
in
the
latter
half
of
it
i
went
sullenly
over
the
furka
exactly
as
easy
a
thing
as
going
up
st
james
street
and
down
piccadilly
i
found
the
same
storm
on
its
summit
but
on
a
highroad
it
was
a
different
affair
i
took
no
short
cuts
i
drank
at
all
the
inns
at
the
base
up
near
the
top
and
at
the
top
i
told
them
as
the
snow
beat
past
how
i
had
attacked
and
all
but
conquered
the
gries
that
wild
morning
and
they
took
me
for
a
liar
so
i
became
silent
even
within
my
own
mind
i
looked
sullenly
at
the
white
ground
all
the
way
and
when
on
the
far
side
i
had
got
low
enough
to
be
rid
of
the
snow
and
wind
and
to
be
in
the
dripping
rain
again
i
welcomed
the
rain
and
let
it
soothe
like
a
sodden
friend
my
sodden
uncongenial
mind
i
will
not
write
of
hospenthal
it
has
an
old
tower
and
the
road
to
it
is
straight
and
hideous
much
i
cared
for
the
old
tower
the
people
of
the
inn
which
i
chose
at
random
can
not
have
loved
me
much
i
will
not
write
of
the
st
gothard
get
it
out
of
a
i
rose
when
i
felt
inclined
i
was
delighted
to
find
it
still
raining
a
dense
mist
above
the
rain
gave
me
still
greater
pleasure
i
had
started
quite
at
my
leisure
late
in
the
day
and
i
did
the
thing
stolidly
and
my
heart
was
like
a
mass
of
coal
or
iron
because
i
was
acknowledging
defeat
you
who
have
never
taken
a
straight
line
and
held
it
nor
seen
strange
men
and
remote
places
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
to
go
round
by
the
common
way
only
in
the
afternoon
and
on
those
little
which
are
sharper
than
any
other
in
the
alps
perhaps
the
road
is
older
something
changed
a
warm
air
stirred
the
dense
mist
which
had
mercifully
cut
me
off
from
anything
but
the
mere
road
and
from
the
contemplation
of
hackneyed
sights
a
hint
or
memory
of
gracious
things
ran
in
the
slight
breeze
the
wreaths
of
fog
would
lift
a
little
for
a
few
yards
and
in
their
clearings
i
thought
to
approach
a
softer
and
more
desirable
world
i
was
soothed
as
though
with
caresses
and
when
i
began
to
see
somewhat
farther
and
felt
a
vigour
and
fulness
in
the
outline
of
the
trees
i
said
to
myself
suddenly
know
what
it
is
it
is
the
south
and
a
great
part
of
my
blood
they
may
call
it
switzerland
still
but
i
know
now
that
i
am
in
italy
and
this
is
the
gate
of
italy
lying
in
groves
then
and
on
till
evening
i
reconciled
myself
with
misfortune
and
when
i
heard
again
at
airolo
the
speech
of
civilized
men
and
saw
the
strong
latin
eyes
and
straight
forms
of
the
race
after
all
those
days
of
fog
and
frost
and
german
speech
and
the
north
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
i
was
as
glad
as
a
man
come
home
again
and
i
could
have
kissed
the
ground
the
wine
of
airolo
and
its
songs
how
greatly
they
refreshed
me
to
see
men
with
answering
eyes
and
to
find
a
salute
returned
the
noise
of
careless
mouths
talking
all
together
the
group
at
cards
and
the
laughter
that
is
proper
to
mankind
the
straight
carriage
of
the
women
and
in
all
the
people
something
erect
and
noble
as
though
indeed
they
possessed
the
earth
i
made
a
meal
there
talking
to
all
my
companions
left
and
right
in
a
new
speech
of
my
own
which
was
made
up
as
it
were
of
the
essence
of
all
the
latin
tongues
saying
si
jo
a
traversa
li
montagna
no
erat
facile
nenni
ii
san
gottardo
nil
est
pooh
poco
ma
hesterna
jo
ha
voulu
traversar
in
val
bavona
e
credi
non
ritornar
namfredo
fredo
erat
in
alto
la
tourmente
ma
prise
and
so
forth
explaining
all
fully
with
gestures
exaggerating
emphasizing
and
acting
the
whole
matter
so
that
they
understood
me
without
much
error
but
i
found
it
more
difficult
to
understand
them
because
they
had
a
regular
formed
language
with
terminations
and
special
words
it
went
to
my
heart
to
offer
them
no
wine
but
a
thought
was
in
me
of
which
you
shall
soon
hear
more
my
money
was
running
low
and
the
chief
anxiety
of
a
civilized
man
was
spreading
over
my
mind
like
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
over
a
field
of
corn
in
summer
they
gave
me
a
number
of
and
at
parting
i
could
not
forbear
from
boasting
that
i
was
a
pilgrim
on
my
way
to
rome
this
they
repeated
one
to
another
and
one
man
told
me
that
the
next
good
was
a
town
called
faido
three
hours
down
the
road
he
held
up
three
fingers
to
explain
and
that
was
the
last
intercourse
i
had
with
the
airolans
for
at
once
i
took
the
road
i
glanced
up
the
dark
ravine
which
i
should
have
descended
had
i
crossed
the
nufenen
i
thought
of
the
val
bavona
only
just
over
the
great
wall
that
held
the
west
and
in
one
place
where
a
rift
you
have
just
seen
its
picture
led
up
to
the
summits
of
the
hills
i
was
half
tempted
to
go
back
to
airolo
and
sleep
and
next
morning
to
attempt
a
crossing
but
i
had
accepted
my
fate
on
the
gries
and
the
falling
road
also
held
me
and
so
i
continued
my
way
everything
was
pleasing
in
this
new
valley
under
the
sunlight
that
still
came
strongly
from
behind
the
enormous
mountains
everything
also
was
new
and
i
was
evidently
now
in
a
country
of
a
special
kind
the
slopes
were
populous
i
had
come
to
the
great
mother
of
fruits
and
men
and
i
was
soon
to
see
her
cities
and
her
old
walls
and
the
rivers
that
glide
by
them
church
towers
also
repeated
the
same
shapes
up
and
up
the
wooded
hills
until
the
villages
stopped
at
the
line
of
the
higher
slopes
and
at
the
patches
of
snow
the
houses
were
square
and
coloured
they
were
graced
with
arbours
and
there
seemed
to
be
all
around
nothing
but
what
was
reasonable
and
secure
and
especially
no
rich
or
poor
i
noticed
all
these
things
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
till
not
two
hours
from
airolo
i
came
to
a
step
in
the
valley
for
the
valley
of
the
ticino
is
made
up
of
distinct
levels
each
of
which
might
have
held
a
lake
once
for
the
way
it
is
enclosed
and
each
level
ends
in
high
rocks
with
a
gorge
between
them
down
this
gorge
the
river
tumbles
in
falls
and
rapids
and
the
road
picks
its
way
down
steeply
all
banked
and
cut
and
sometimes
has
to
cross
from
side
to
side
by
a
bridge
while
the
railway
above
one
overcomes
the
sharp
descent
by
running
round
into
the
heart
of
the
hills
through
circular
tunnels
and
coming
out
again
far
below
the
cavern
where
it
plunged
in
then
when
all
three
the
river
the
road
and
the
railway
have
got
over
the
great
step
a
new
level
of
the
valley
opens
this
is
the
way
the
road
comes
into
the
south
and
as
i
passed
down
to
the
lower
valley
though
it
was
darkening
into
evening
something
melted
out
of
the
mountain
air
there
was
content
and
warmth
in
the
growing
things
and
i
found
it
was
a
place
for
vineyards
so
before
it
was
yet
dark
i
came
into
faido
and
there
i
slept
having
at
last
after
so
many
adventures
crossed
the
threshold
and
occupied
italy
next
day
before
sunrise
i
went
out
and
all
the
valley
was
adorned
and
tremulous
with
the
films
of
morning
now
all
of
you
who
have
hitherto
followed
the
story
of
this
great
journey
put
out
of
your
minds
the
alps
and
the
passes
and
the
snows
postpone
even
for
a
moment
the
influence
of
the
happy
dawn
and
of
that
south
into
which
i
had
entered
and
consider
only
this
truth
that
i
found
myself
just
out
of
faido
on
this
blessed
date
of
god
with
eight
francs
and
forty
centimes
for
my
viaticum
and
temporal
provision
wherewith
to
accomplish
the
good
work
of
my
pilgrimage
now
when
you
consider
that
coffee
and
bread
was
twopence
and
a
penny
for
the
maid
you
may
say
without
lying
that
i
had
left
behind
me
the
escarpment
of
the
alps
and
stood
upon
the
downward
slopes
of
the
first
italian
stream
and
at
the
summit
of
the
entry
road
with
francs
ten
in
my
pocket
my
body
hearty
and
my
spirit
light
for
the
arriving
sun
shot
glory
into
the
sky
the
air
was
keen
and
a
fresh
day
came
radiant
over
the
high
eastern
walls
of
the
valley
and
what
of
that
why
one
might
make
many
things
of
it
for
instance
eight
francs
and
ten
centimes
is
a
very
good
day
wages
it
is
a
lot
to
spend
in
cab
fares
but
little
for
a
it
is
a
heavy
price
for
burgundy
but
a
song
for
tokay
it
is
eighty
miles
and
more
it
is
thirty
or
less
it
is
a
flash
in
a
train
luxe
and
a
mere
fleabite
as
a
bribe
to
a
journalist
it
would
be
enormous
to
give
it
to
an
apostle
begging
at
a
church
door
but
nothing
to
spend
on
luncheon
properly
spent
i
can
imagine
it
saving
five
or
six
souls
but
i
can
not
believe
that
so
paltry
a
sum
would
damn
half
an
one
then
again
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
to
sing
about
thus
if
one
were
a
modern
fool
one
might
write
a
dirge
with
francs
et
dix
centimes
all
chanted
on
one
low
sad
note
and
coming
in
between
brackets
for
a
and
with
a
lot
about
autumn
and
death
which
last
death
that
is
people
nowadays
seem
to
regard
as
something
odd
whereas
it
is
well
known
to
be
the
commonest
thing
in
the
world
or
one
might
make
the
words
the
backbone
of
a
triolet
only
one
would
have
to
split
them
up
to
fit
it
into
the
metre
or
one
might
make
it
the
decisive
line
in
a
sonnet
or
one
might
make
a
pretty
little
lyric
of
it
to
the
tune
of
la
marquise
francs
et
dix
centimes
tra
la
la
la
la
la
or
one
might
put
it
rhetorically
fiercely
stoically
finely
republicanly
into
the
heroics
of
the
great
school
thus
hernani
with
indignation
dans
ces
efforts
vous
à
offrir
ruy
blas
simply
huit
francs
et
dix
centimes
or
finally
for
this
kind
of
thing
can
not
go
on
for
ever
one
might
curl
one
hair
and
dye
it
black
and
cock
a
dirty
slouch
hat
over
one
ear
and
take
a
guitar
and
sit
on
a
flat
stone
by
the
roadside
and
cross
one
legs
and
after
a
few
pings
and
pongs
on
the
strings
strike
up
a
ballad
with
the
refrain
toujours
huit
francs
et
dix
centimes
a
jocular
a
triumphant
refrain
but
all
this
is
by
the
way
the
point
is
why
was
the
eight
francs
and
ten
centimes
of
such
importance
just
there
and
then
for
this
reason
that
i
could
get
no
more
money
before
milan
and
i
think
a
little
reflection
will
show
you
what
a
meaning
lies
in
that
phrase
milan
was
nearer
ninety
miles
than
eighty
miles
off
by
the
strict
road
it
was
over
ninety
and
so
i
was
forced
to
consider
and
to
be
anxious
for
how
would
this
money
hold
out
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
forced
marches
and
little
prospect
of
luxuries
but
could
it
be
done
i
thought
it
could
and
i
reasoned
this
way
is
true
i
need
a
good
deal
of
food
and
that
if
a
man
is
to
cover
great
distances
he
must
keep
fit
it
is
also
true
that
many
men
have
done
more
on
less
on
the
other
hand
they
were
men
who
were
not
pressed
for
time
i
am
and
i
do
not
know
the
habits
of
the
country
ninety
miles
is
three
good
days
two
very
heavy
days
indeed
whether
it
can
be
done
at
all
in
two
is
doubtful
but
it
can
be
done
in
two
days
two
nights
and
half
the
third
day
so
if
i
plan
it
thus
i
shall
achieve
it
namely
to
march
say
miles
or
more
and
to
sleep
rough
at
the
end
of
it
my
food
may
cost
me
altogether
three
francs
i
march
the
next
day
to
thirty
my
food
costing
me
another
three
francs
then
with
the
remaining
two
francs
and
ten
centimes
i
will
take
a
bed
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
coffee
and
bread
next
morning
and
will
march
the
remaining
twenty
miles
or
less
as
they
may
be
into
milan
with
a
copper
or
two
in
my
pocket
then
in
milan
having
obtained
my
money
i
will
eat
so
i
planned
with
very
careful
and
exact
precision
but
many
accidents
and
unexpected
things
diverting
my
plans
lay
in
wait
for
me
among
the
hills
and
to
cut
a
long
story
short
as
the
old
sailor
said
to
the
young
fool
lector
what
did
the
old
sailor
say
to
the
young
fool
auctor
why
the
old
sailor
was
teaching
the
young
fool
his
compass
and
he
said
we
go
from
north
making
round
by
west
and
then
by
south
round
by
east
again
to
north
there
are
points
of
the
compass
namely
first
these
four
and
and
these
are
halved
making
four
more
s
and
ne
i
trust
i
make
myself
clear
said
the
old
sailor
makes
eight
divisions
as
we
call
them
so
look
smart
and
follow
each
of
these
eight
is
divided
into
two
symbolically
and
symmetrically
divided
parts
as
is
most
evident
in
the
nomenclature
of
the
same
said
the
old
sailor
between
and
ne
is
between
ne
and
is
between
and
se
is
see
said
the
young
fool
the
old
sailor
frowning
at
him
continued
you
there
heels
together
and
note
you
well
each
of
these
sixteen
divisions
is
separated
quite
reasonably
and
precisely
into
two
thus
between
and
nne
we
get
by
said
the
old
sailor
between
nne
and
ne
we
get
ne
by
and
between
ne
and
ene
we
get
ne
by
said
the
old
sailor
between
ene
and
we
get
by
and
then
between
and
ese
we
get
but
here
he
noticed
something
dangerous
in
the
young
fool
eyes
and
having
read
all
his
life
admiral
griles
on
discipline
and
knowing
that
discipline
is
a
subtle
bond
depending
on
force
but
on
an
attitude
of
the
mind
he
continued
so
to
cut
a
long
story
short
we
come
round
to
the
north
again
then
he
added
is
customary
also
to
divide
each
of
these
points
into
quarters
thus
nne
signifies
but
at
this
point
the
young
fool
whose
hands
were
clasped
behind
him
and
concealed
a
up
and
killed
the
old
sailor
and
so
rounded
off
this
fascinating
tale
well
then
to
cut
a
long
story
short
i
had
to
make
forced
marches
with
eight
francs
and
ten
centimes
and
nearer
ninety
than
miles
before
the
next
relief
it
was
necessary
to
plan
and
then
to
urge
on
heroically
said
i
to
myself
thing
can
be
done
quite
easily
what
is
ninety
miles
two
long
days
who
can
not
live
on
four
francs
a
day
why
lots
of
men
do
it
on
two
francs
a
day
but
my
guardian
angel
said
to
me
are
an
ass
ninety
miles
is
a
great
deal
more
than
twice
besides
which
said
he
great
effort
needs
largeness
and
ease
men
who
live
on
two
francs
a
day
or
less
are
not
men
who
attempt
to
march
miles
a
day
indeed
my
friend
you
are
pushing
it
very
close
thought
i
least
in
such
a
glorious
air
with
such
hills
all
about
one
and
such
a
race
one
can
come
to
no
great
harm
but
i
knew
within
me
that
latins
are
hard
where
money
is
concerned
and
i
feared
for
my
strength
i
was
determined
to
push
forward
and
to
live
on
little
i
filled
my
lungs
and
put
on
the
spirit
of
an
attempt
and
swung
down
the
valley
alas
i
may
not
linger
on
that
charge
for
if
i
did
i
should
not
give
you
any
measure
of
its
determination
and
rapidity
many
little
places
passed
me
off
the
road
on
the
flanks
of
that
valley
and
mostly
to
the
left
while
the
morning
was
yet
young
i
came
to
the
packed
little
town
of
bodio
and
passed
the
eight
franc
limit
by
taking
coffee
brandy
and
bread
there
also
were
a
gentleman
and
a
lady
in
a
carriage
who
wondered
where
i
was
going
and
i
told
them
in
french
rome
it
was
nine
in
the
morning
when
i
came
to
biasca
the
sun
was
glorious
and
not
yet
warm
it
was
too
early
for
a
meal
they
gave
me
a
little
cold
meat
and
bread
and
wine
and
seven
francs
stood
out
dry
above
the
falling
tide
of
my
money
here
at
biasca
the
valley
took
on
a
different
aspect
it
became
wider
and
more
of
a
countryside
the
vast
hills
receding
took
on
an
appearance
of
less
familiar
majesty
and
because
the
trend
of
the
ticino
turned
southerly
some
miles
ahead
the
whole
place
seemed
enclosed
from
the
world
one
would
have
said
that
a
high
mountain
before
me
closed
it
in
and
rendered
it
unique
and
unknown
had
not
a
wide
cleft
in
the
east
argued
another
pass
over
the
hills
and
reminded
me
that
there
were
various
routes
over
the
crest
of
the
alps
indeed
this
hackneyed
approach
to
italy
which
i
had
dreaded
and
despised
and
accepted
only
after
a
defeat
was
very
marvellous
and
this
valley
of
the
ticino
ought
to
stand
apart
and
be
a
commonwealth
of
its
own
like
andorra
or
the
gresivaudan
the
noble
garden
of
the
isere
within
the
first
gates
of
the
dauphine
i
was
fatigued
and
my
senses
lost
acuteness
still
i
noticed
with
delight
the
new
character
of
the
miles
i
pursued
a
low
hill
just
before
me
jutting
out
apparently
from
the
high
western
mountains
forbade
me
to
see
beyond
it
the
plain
was
alluvial
while
copses
and
wood
and
many
cultivated
fields
now
found
room
where
higher
up
had
been
nothing
but
the
bed
of
a
torrent
with
bare
banks
and
strips
of
grass
immediately
above
them
it
was
a
place
worthy
of
a
special
name
and
of
being
one
lordship
and
a
countryside
still
i
went
on
towards
that
near
boundary
of
the
mountain
spur
and
towards
the
point
where
the
river
rounded
it
the
great
barrier
hill
before
me
still
seeming
to
shut
in
the
valley
it
was
noon
or
thereabouts
the
heat
was
increasing
i
did
not
feel
it
greatly
for
i
had
eaten
and
drunk
next
to
nothing
when
coming
round
the
point
there
opened
out
before
me
the
great
fan
of
the
lower
valley
and
the
widening
and
fruitful
plain
through
which
the
ticino
rolls
in
a
full
river
to
reach
lake
major
which
is
its
sea
weary
as
i
was
the
vision
of
this
sudden
expansion
roused
me
and
made
me
forget
everything
except
the
sight
before
me
the
valley
turned
well
southward
as
it
broadened
the
alps
spread
out
on
either
side
like
great
arms
welcoming
the
southern
day
the
wholesome
and
familiar
haze
that
should
accompany
summer
dimmed
the
more
distant
mountains
of
the
lakes
and
turned
them
amethystine
and
something
of
repose
and
of
distance
was
added
to
the
landscape
something
i
had
not
seen
for
many
days
there
was
room
in
that
air
and
space
for
dreams
and
for
many
living
men
for
towns
perhaps
on
the
slopes
for
the
boats
of
happy
men
upon
the
waters
and
everywhere
for
crowded
and
contented
living
history
might
be
in
all
this
and
i
remembered
it
was
the
entry
and
introduction
of
many
armies
singing
therefore
a
song
of
charlemagne
i
swung
on
in
a
good
effort
to
where
right
under
the
sun
what
seemed
a
wall
and
two
towers
on
a
sharp
little
hillock
set
in
the
bosom
of
the
valley
showed
me
bellinzona
within
the
central
street
of
that
city
and
on
its
shaded
side
i
sank
down
upon
a
bench
before
the
curtained
door
of
a
drinking
booth
and
boasted
that
i
had
covered
in
that
morning
my
miles
the
woman
of
the
place
came
out
to
greet
me
and
asked
me
a
question
i
did
not
catch
it
for
it
was
in
a
foreign
language
but
guessing
her
to
mean
that
i
should
take
something
i
asked
for
vermouth
and
seeing
before
me
a
strange
door
built
of
red
stone
i
drew
it
as
i
sipped
my
glass
and
the
woman
talked
to
me
all
the
while
in
a
language
i
could
not
understand
and
as
i
drew
i
became
so
interested
that
i
forgot
my
poverty
and
offered
her
husband
a
glass
and
then
gave
another
to
a
lounging
man
that
had
watched
me
at
work
and
so
from
less
than
seven
francs
my
money
fell
to
six
exactly
and
my
pencil
fell
from
my
hand
and
i
became
afraid
have
done
a
foolish
thing
said
i
to
myself
have
endangered
the
success
of
my
endeavour
nevertheless
that
can
not
now
be
remedied
and
i
must
eat
and
as
eating
is
best
where
one
has
friends
i
will
ask
a
meal
of
this
woman
now
had
they
understood
french
i
could
have
bargained
and
chosen
as
it
was
i
had
to
take
what
they
were
taking
and
so
i
sat
with
them
as
they
all
came
out
and
ate
together
at
the
little
table
they
had
soup
and
flesh
wine
and
bread
and
as
we
ate
we
talked
not
understanding
each
other
and
laughing
heartily
at
our
mutual
ignorance
and
they
charged
me
a
franc
which
brought
my
six
francs
down
to
five
but
i
knowing
my
subtle
duty
to
the
world
put
down
twopence
more
as
i
would
have
done
anywhere
else
for
a
boire
and
so
with
four
francs
and
eighty
centimes
left
and
with
much
less
than
a
third
of
my
task
accomplished
i
rose
now
drowsy
with
the
food
and
wine
and
saluting
them
took
the
road
once
more
but
as
i
left
bellinzona
there
was
a
task
before
me
which
was
to
bring
my
poverty
to
the
test
for
you
must
know
that
my
map
was
a
bad
one
and
on
a
very
small
scale
and
the
road
from
bellinzona
to
lugano
has
a
crook
in
it
and
it
was
essential
to
find
a
short
cut
so
i
thought
to
myself
will
try
to
see
a
good
map
as
cheaply
as
possible
and
i
slunk
off
to
the
right
into
a
kind
of
main
square
and
there
i
found
a
proud
stationer
shop
such
as
would
deal
with
rich
men
only
or
tourists
of
the
coarser
and
less
humble
kind
i
entered
with
some
assurance
and
said
in
french
i
wish
to
know
the
hills
between
here
and
lugano
but
i
am
too
poor
to
buy
a
map
if
you
will
let
me
look
at
one
for
a
few
moments
i
will
pay
you
what
you
think
fit
the
wicked
stationer
became
like
a
devil
for
pride
and
glaring
at
me
said
look
for
yourself
i
do
not
take
pence
i
sell
maps
i
do
not
hire
them
then
i
thought
i
take
a
favour
from
such
a
man
but
i
yielded
and
did
i
went
up
to
the
wall
and
studied
a
large
map
for
some
moments
then
as
i
left
i
said
to
him
i
shall
always
hold
in
remembrance
the
day
on
which
you
did
me
this
signal
kindness
nor
shall
i
forget
your
courtesy
and
goodwill
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
at
that
why
he
burst
into
twenty
smiles
and
bowed
and
seemed
beatified
and
said
i
can
do
for
my
customers
and
for
visitors
to
this
town
i
shall
always
be
delighted
to
do
pray
sir
will
you
not
look
at
other
maps
for
a
moment
now
why
did
he
say
this
and
grin
happily
like
a
gargoyle
appeased
did
something
in
my
accent
suggest
wealth
or
was
he
naturally
kindly
i
do
not
know
but
of
this
i
am
sure
one
should
never
hate
human
beings
merely
on
a
first
nor
on
a
tenth
impression
who
knows
this
of
bellinzona
may
have
been
a
good
man
anyhow
i
left
him
as
rich
as
i
had
found
him
and
remembering
that
the
true
key
to
a
forced
march
is
to
break
the
hours
into
three
pieces
and
now
feeling
the
extreme
heat
i
went
out
along
the
burning
straight
road
until
i
found
a
border
of
grass
and
a
hedge
and
there
in
spite
of
the
dust
and
the
continually
passing
carts
i
lay
at
full
length
in
the
shade
and
fell
into
the
sleep
of
men
against
whom
there
is
no
reckoning
just
as
i
forgot
the
world
i
heard
a
clock
strike
two
i
slept
for
hours
beneath
that
hedge
and
when
i
woke
the
air
was
no
longer
a
trembling
furnace
but
everything
about
me
was
wrapped
round
as
in
a
cloak
of
southern
afternoon
and
was
still
the
sun
had
fallen
midway
and
shone
in
steady
glory
through
a
haze
that
overhung
lake
major
and
the
wide
luxuriant
estuary
of
the
vale
there
lay
before
me
a
long
straight
road
for
miles
at
the
base
of
high
hills
then
far
off
this
road
seemed
to
end
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
called
i
believe
ash
mount
or
cinder
hill
but
my
imperfect
map
told
me
that
here
it
went
sharp
round
to
the
left
choosing
a
pass
and
then
at
an
angle
went
down
its
way
to
lugano
now
lugano
was
not
fifteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
where
i
stood
and
i
determined
to
cut
off
that
angle
by
climbing
the
high
hills
just
above
me
they
were
wooded
only
on
their
slopes
their
crest
and
much
of
their
sides
were
a
of
parched
grass
with
rocks
appearing
here
and
there
at
the
first
divergent
lane
i
made
off
eastward
from
the
road
and
began
to
climb
in
under
the
chestnut
trees
the
lane
became
a
number
of
vague
beaten
paths
i
followed
straight
upwards
here
and
there
were
little
houses
standing
hidden
in
leaves
and
soon
i
crossed
the
railway
and
at
last
above
the
trees
i
saw
the
sight
of
all
the
bellinzona
valley
to
the
north
and
turning
my
eyes
i
saw
it
broaden
out
between
its
walls
to
where
the
lake
lay
very
bright
in
spite
of
the
slight
mist
and
this
mist
gave
the
lake
distances
and
the
mountains
round
about
it
were
transfigured
and
seemed
part
of
the
mere
light
the
italian
lakes
have
that
in
them
and
their
air
which
removes
them
from
common
living
their
beauty
is
not
the
beauty
which
each
of
us
sees
for
himself
in
the
world
it
is
rather
the
beauty
of
a
special
creation
the
expression
of
some
mind
to
eyes
innocent
and
first
freshly
noting
our
great
temporal
inheritance
mean
to
the
eyes
of
a
boy
and
girl
just
entered
upon
the
estate
of
this
glorious
earth
and
thinking
themselves
immortal
this
shrine
of
europe
might
remain
for
ever
in
the
memory
an
enchanted
experience
in
which
the
single
sense
of
sight
had
almost
touched
the
boundary
of
music
they
would
remember
these
lakes
as
the
central
emotion
of
their
youth
to
mean
men
also
who
in
spite
of
years
and
of
a
full
foreknowledge
of
death
yet
attempt
nothing
but
the
satisfaction
of
sense
and
pride
themselves
upon
the
taste
and
fineness
with
which
they
achieve
this
satisfaction
the
italian
lakes
would
seem
a
place
for
habitation
and
there
such
a
man
might
build
his
house
contentedly
but
to
ordinary
christians
i
am
sure
there
is
something
unnatural
in
this
beauty
of
theirs
and
they
find
in
it
either
a
paradise
only
to
be
won
by
a
much
longer
road
to
a
bait
and
veil
of
sorcery
behind
which
lies
great
peril
now
for
all
we
know
beauty
beyond
the
world
may
not
really
bear
this
double
aspect
but
to
us
on
earth
if
we
are
ordinary
men
beauty
of
this
kind
has
something
evil
have
you
not
read
in
books
how
men
when
they
see
even
divine
visions
are
terrified
so
as
i
looked
at
lake
major
in
its
halo
i
also
was
afraid
and
i
was
glad
to
cross
the
ridge
and
crest
of
the
hill
and
to
shut
out
that
picture
framed
all
round
with
glory
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
i
found
to
my
great
disgust
not
as
i
had
hoped
a
fine
slope
down
leading
to
lugano
but
a
second
interior
valley
and
another
range
just
opposite
me
i
had
not
the
patience
to
climb
this
so
i
followed
down
the
marshy
land
at
the
foot
of
it
passed
round
the
end
of
the
hill
and
came
upon
the
railway
which
had
tunnelled
under
the
range
i
had
crossed
i
followed
the
railway
for
a
little
while
and
at
last
crossed
it
penetrated
through
a
thick
brushwood
forded
a
nasty
little
stream
and
found
myself
again
on
the
main
road
wishing
heartily
i
had
never
left
it
it
was
still
at
least
seven
miles
to
lugano
and
though
all
the
way
was
downhill
yet
fatigue
threatened
me
these
short
cuts
over
marshy
land
and
through
difficult
thickets
are
not
short
cuts
at
all
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
although
it
was
already
evening
i
dared
not
rest
a
while
when
there
appeared
at
a
turn
in
the
road
a
little
pink
house
with
a
yard
all
shaded
over
by
a
vast
tree
there
was
also
a
trellis
making
a
roof
over
a
plain
bench
and
table
and
on
the
trellis
grew
vines
such
houses
i
thought
gods
walk
when
they
come
down
and
talk
with
men
and
such
houses
are
the
scenes
of
adventures
i
will
go
in
and
rest
so
i
walked
straight
into
the
courtyard
and
found
there
a
shrivelled
man
with
kindly
eyes
who
was
singing
a
song
to
himself
he
could
talk
a
little
french
a
little
english
and
his
own
italian
language
he
had
been
to
america
and
to
paris
he
was
full
of
memories
and
when
i
had
listened
to
these
and
asked
for
food
and
drink
and
said
i
was
extremely
poor
and
would
have
to
bargain
he
made
a
kind
of
litany
of
will
not
cheat
you
i
am
an
honest
man
i
also
am
poor
and
so
forth
nevertheless
i
argued
about
every
item
the
bread
the
sausage
and
the
beer
seeing
that
i
was
in
necessity
he
charged
me
about
three
times
their
value
but
i
beat
him
down
to
double
and
lower
than
that
he
would
not
go
then
we
sat
down
together
at
the
table
and
ate
and
drank
and
talked
of
far
countries
and
he
would
interject
remarks
on
his
honesty
compared
with
the
wickedness
of
his
neighbours
and
i
parried
with
illustrations
of
my
poverty
and
need
pulling
out
the
four
francs
odd
that
remained
to
me
and
jingling
them
sorrowfully
in
my
hand
these
i
said
must
reach
milan
then
i
left
him
and
as
i
went
down
the
road
a
slight
breeze
came
on
and
brought
with
it
the
coolness
of
evening
at
last
the
falling
plateau
reached
an
edge
many
little
lights
glittered
below
me
and
i
sat
on
a
stone
and
looked
down
at
the
town
of
lugano
it
was
nearly
dark
the
mountains
all
around
had
lost
their
mouldings
and
were
marked
in
flat
silhouettes
against
the
sky
the
new
lake
which
had
just
appeared
below
me
was
bright
as
water
is
at
dusk
and
far
away
in
the
north
and
east
the
high
alps
still
stood
up
and
received
the
large
glow
of
evening
everything
else
was
full
of
the
coming
night
and
a
few
stars
shone
up
from
she
town
came
the
distant
noise
of
music
otherwise
there
was
no
sound
i
could
have
rested
there
a
long
time
letting
my
tired
body
lapse
into
the
advancing
darkness
and
catching
in
my
spirit
the
inspiration
of
the
silence
had
it
not
been
for
hunger
i
knew
by
experience
that
when
it
is
very
late
one
can
not
be
served
in
the
of
poor
men
and
i
had
not
the
money
or
any
other
so
i
rose
and
shambled
down
the
steep
road
into
the
town
and
there
i
found
a
square
with
arcades
and
in
the
corner
of
this
square
just
such
a
little
tavern
as
i
required
entering
therefore
and
taking
off
my
hat
very
low
i
said
in
french
to
a
man
who
was
sitting
there
with
friends
and
who
was
the
master
what
is
the
least
price
at
which
you
can
give
me
a
meal
he
said
do
you
want
i
answered
meat
vegetables
bread
and
a
little
wine
he
counted
on
his
fingers
while
all
his
friends
stared
respectfully
at
him
and
me
he
then
gave
orders
and
a
very
young
and
beautiful
girl
set
before
me
as
excellent
a
meal
as
i
had
eaten
for
days
on
days
and
he
charged
me
but
a
franc
and
a
half
he
gave
me
also
coffee
and
a
little
cheese
and
i
feeling
hearty
gave
threepence
over
for
the
service
and
they
all
very
genially
wished
me
a
but
their
wishes
were
of
no
value
to
me
for
the
night
was
terrible
i
had
gone
over
forty
miles
how
much
over
i
did
not
know
i
should
have
slept
at
lugano
but
my
lightening
purse
forbade
me
i
thought
will
push
on
and
on
after
all
i
have
already
slept
and
so
broken
the
back
of
the
day
i
will
push
on
till
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
tether
then
i
will
find
a
wood
and
sleep
within
four
miles
my
strength
abandoned
me
i
was
not
even
so
far
down
the
lake
as
to
have
lost
the
sound
of
the
band
at
lugano
floating
up
the
still
water
when
i
was
under
an
imperative
necessity
for
repose
it
was
perhaps
ten
and
the
sky
was
open
and
glorious
with
stars
i
climbed
up
a
bank
on
my
right
and
searching
for
a
place
to
lie
found
one
under
a
tree
near
a
great
telegraph
pole
here
was
a
little
parched
grass
and
one
could
lie
there
and
see
the
lake
and
wait
for
sleep
it
was
a
benediction
to
stretch
out
all
supported
by
the
dry
earth
with
my
little
for
pillow
and
to
look
at
the
clear
night
above
the
hills
and
to
listen
to
the
very
distant
music
and
to
wonder
whether
or
not
in
this
strange
southern
country
there
might
not
be
snakes
gliding
about
in
the
undergrowth
caught
in
such
a
skein
of
influence
i
was
soothed
and
fell
asleep
for
a
little
while
i
slept
dreamlessly
just
so
much
of
my
living
self
remained
as
can
know
without
understanding
the
air
around
it
is
the
life
of
trees
that
the
barely
conscious
base
of
nature
which
trees
and
sleeping
men
are
sunk
in
is
not
only
dominated
by
an
immeasurable
calm
but
is
also
beyond
all
expression
contented
and
in
its
very
stuff
there
is
a
complete
and
changeless
joy
this
is
surely
what
the
great
mind
meant
when
it
said
to
the
athenian
judges
that
death
must
not
be
dreaded
since
no
experience
in
life
was
so
pleasurable
as
a
deep
sleep
for
being
wise
and
seeing
the
intercommunion
of
things
he
could
not
mean
extinction
which
is
nonsense
but
a
lapse
into
that
of
which
i
speak
for
there
are
gods
also
below
the
earth
but
a
dream
came
into
my
sleep
and
disturbed
me
increasing
life
and
therefore
bringing
pain
i
dreamt
that
i
was
arguing
at
first
easily
then
violently
with
another
man
more
and
more
he
pressed
me
and
at
last
in
my
dream
there
were
clearly
spoken
words
and
he
said
to
me
must
be
wrong
because
you
are
so
cold
if
you
were
right
you
would
not
be
so
cold
and
this
argument
seemed
quite
reasonable
to
me
in
my
foolish
dream
and
i
muttered
to
him
are
right
i
must
be
in
the
wrong
it
is
very
cold
then
i
half
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
the
telegraph
pole
the
trees
and
the
lake
far
up
the
lake
where
the
italian
frontier
cuts
it
the
looking
for
smugglers
were
casting
their
one
of
the
roving
beams
fell
full
on
me
and
i
became
broad
awake
i
stood
up
it
was
indeed
cold
with
a
kind
of
clinging
and
grasping
chill
that
was
not
to
be
expressed
in
degrees
of
heat
but
in
dampness
perhaps
or
perhaps
in
some
subtler
influence
of
the
air
i
sat
on
the
bank
and
gazed
at
the
lake
in
some
despair
certainly
i
could
not
sleep
again
without
a
covering
cloth
and
it
was
now
past
midnight
nor
did
i
know
of
any
house
whether
if
i
took
the
road
i
should
find
one
in
a
mile
or
in
two
or
in
five
and
note
you
i
was
utterly
exhausted
that
enormous
march
from
faido
though
it
had
been
wisely
broken
by
the
siesta
at
bellinzona
needed
more
than
a
few
cold
hours
under
trees
and
i
thought
of
the
three
poor
francs
in
my
pocket
and
of
the
miles
remaining
to
milan
the
stars
were
beyond
the
middle
of
their
slow
turning
and
i
watched
them
splendid
and
in
order
for
sympathy
as
i
also
regularly
but
slowly
and
painfully
dragged
myself
along
my
appointed
road
but
in
a
very
short
time
a
great
tall
square
white
house
stood
right
on
the
roadway
and
to
my
intense
joy
i
saw
a
light
in
one
of
its
higher
windows
standing
therefore
beneath
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
five
or
six
times
a
woman
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
into
the
fresh
night
and
said
can
not
sleep
here
we
have
no
rooms
then
she
remained
looking
out
of
her
window
and
ready
to
analyse
the
difficulties
of
the
moment
a
woman
and
fat
in
a
moment
another
window
at
the
same
level
but
farther
from
me
opened
and
a
man
leaned
out
just
as
those
alternate
figures
come
in
and
out
of
the
toys
that
tell
the
weather
is
impossible
said
the
man
have
no
rooms
then
they
talked
a
great
deal
together
while
i
shouted
vis
non
e
possibile
dormire
in
la
foresta
e
troppo
fredo
vis
ne
me
assassinare
veni
de
lugano
e
piu
non
e
possibile
ritornare
and
so
forth
they
answered
in
strophe
and
antistrophe
sometimes
together
in
full
chorus
and
again
in
semichorus
and
with
variations
that
it
was
impossible
then
a
light
showed
in
the
chinks
of
their
great
door
the
lock
grated
and
it
opened
a
third
person
a
tall
youth
stood
in
the
hall
i
went
forward
into
the
breach
and
occupied
the
hall
he
blinked
at
me
above
a
candle
and
murmured
as
a
man
apologizing
is
not
possible
whatever
i
have
in
common
with
these
southerners
made
me
understand
that
i
had
won
so
i
smiled
at
him
and
nodded
he
also
smiled
and
at
once
beckoned
to
me
he
led
me
upstairs
and
showed
me
a
charming
bed
in
a
clean
room
where
there
was
a
portrait
of
the
pope
looking
cunning
the
charge
for
that
delightful
and
human
place
was
sixpence
and
as
i
said
to
the
youth
the
man
and
woman
from
above
said
also
and
this
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
most
permanent
feature
in
the
italian
character
the
good
people
when
i
woke
and
rose
i
was
the
first
to
be
up
and
out
it
was
high
morning
the
sun
was
not
yet
quite
over
the
eastern
mountains
but
i
had
slept
though
so
shortly
yet
at
great
ease
and
the
world
seemed
new
and
full
of
a
merry
mind
the
sky
was
coloured
like
that
high
metal
work
which
you
may
see
in
the
studios
of
paris
there
was
gold
in
it
fading
into
bronze
and
above
the
bronze
softened
to
silver
a
little
morning
breeze
courageous
and
steady
blew
down
the
lake
and
provoked
the
water
to
glad
ripples
and
there
was
nothing
that
did
not
move
and
take
pleasure
in
the
day
the
lake
of
lugano
is
of
a
complicated
shape
and
has
many
arms
it
is
at
this
point
very
narrow
indeed
and
shallow
too
a
mole
pierced
at
either
end
with
low
arches
has
here
been
thrown
across
it
and
by
this
mole
the
railway
and
the
road
pass
over
to
the
eastern
shore
i
turned
in
this
long
causeway
and
noticed
the
northern
view
on
the
farther
shore
was
an
old
village
and
some
of
rich
men
on
the
shore
the
boats
also
were
beginning
to
go
about
the
water
these
boats
were
strange
unlike
other
boats
they
were
covered
with
hoods
and
looked
like
floating
waggons
this
was
to
shield
the
rowers
from
the
sun
far
off
a
man
was
sailing
with
a
little
brown
it
was
morning
and
all
the
world
was
alive
coffee
in
the
village
left
me
two
francs
and
two
pennies
i
still
thought
the
thing
could
be
done
so
invigorating
and
deceiving
are
the
early
hours
and
coming
farther
down
the
road
to
an
old
and
beautiful
courtyard
on
the
left
i
drew
it
and
hearing
a
bell
at
hand
i
saw
a
church
with
trees
before
it
and
went
in
to
mass
and
though
it
was
a
little
low
village
mass
yet
the
priest
had
three
acolytes
to
serve
it
and
true
and
gracious
mark
of
a
catholic
country
these
boys
were
restless
and
distracted
at
their
office
you
may
think
it
trivial
but
it
was
certainly
a
portent
one
of
the
acolytes
had
half
his
head
clean
shaved
a
most
extraordinary
sight
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
from
it
and
i
heartily
wished
i
had
an
with
me
to
tell
me
what
it
might
mean
when
there
were
oracles
on
earth
before
pan
died
this
sight
would
have
been
of
the
utmost
use
for
i
should
have
consulted
the
oracle
woman
for
a
lira
at
biasca
for
instance
or
in
the
lonely
woods
of
the
cinder
mountain
and
after
a
lot
of
incense
and
hesitation
and
wrestling
with
the
god
the
oracle
would
have
accepted
apollo
and
staring
like
one
entranced
she
would
have
chanted
verses
which
though
ambiguous
would
at
least
have
been
a
guide

well
well
you
see
it
was
but
a
rustic
oracle
at
the
revelation
and
even
that
is
supposing
silver
at
par
let
us
translate
it
for
the
vulgar
when
early
morning
seems
but
eve
and
they
that
still
refuse

pilgrim
great
attempt

fail
of

such
an
oracle
might
very
easily
have
made
me
fear
too
much
the
head
i
should
have
taken
for
a
priest
especially
if
it
was
to
be
met
with
a
temple
it
might
have
prevented
me
entering
a
church
which
would
have
been
deplorable
then
i
might
have
taken
it
to
mean
that
i
should
never
have
reached
rome
which
would
have
been
a
monstrous
weight
upon
my
mind
still
as
things
unfolded
themselves
the
oracle
would
have
become
plainer
and
plainer
and
i
felt
the
lack
of
it
greatly
for
i
repeat
i
had
certainly
received
an
omen
the
road
now
neared
the
end
of
the
lake
and
the
town
called
capo
di
lago
or
lay
off
to
my
right
i
saw
also
that
in
a
very
little
while
i
should
abruptly
find
the
plains
a
low
hill
some
five
miles
ahead
of
me
was
the
last
roll
of
the
mountains
and
just
above
me
stood
the
last
high
crest
a
precipitous
peak
of
bare
rock
up
which
there
ran
a
to
some
hotel
or
other
i
passed
through
an
old
town
under
the
now
rising
heat
i
passed
a
cemetery
in
the
italian
manner
with
marble
figures
like
common
living
men
the
road
turned
to
the
left
and
i
was
fairly
on
the
shoulder
of
the
last
glacis
i
stood
on
the
alps
at
their
southern
bank
and
before
me
was
lombardy
also
in
this
ending
of
the
swiss
canton
one
was
more
evidently
in
italy
than
ever
a
village
perched
upon
a
rock
deep
woods
and
a
ravine
below
it
its
houses
and
its
church
all
betrayed
the
full
italian
spirit
the
frontier
town
was
chiasso
i
hesitated
with
reverence
before
touching
the
sacred
soil
which
i
had
taken
so
long
to
reach
and
i
longed
to
be
able
to
drink
its
health
but
though
i
had
gone
i
suppose
ten
miles
and
though
the
heat
was
increasing
i
would
not
stop
for
i
remembered
the
two
francs
and
my
former
certitude
of
reaching
milan
was
shaking
and
crumbling
the
great
heat
of
midday
would
soon
be
on
me
i
had
yet
nearly
thirty
miles
to
go
and
my
bad
night
began
to
oppress
me
i
crossed
the
frontier
which
is
here
an
imaginary
line
two
slovenly
men
asked
me
if
i
had
anything
dutiable
on
me
i
said
no
and
it
was
evident
enough
for
in
my
little
sack
or
pocket
was
nothing
but
a
piece
of
bread
if
they
had
applied
the
american
test
and
searched
me
for
money
then
indeed
they
could
have
turned
me
back
and
i
should
have
been
forced
to
go
into
the
fields
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
and
come
into
their
country
by
a
path
instead
of
a
highroad
this
necessity
was
spared
me
i
climbed
slowly
up
the
long
slope
that
hides
como
then
i
came
down
upon
that
lovely
city
and
saw
its
frame
of
hills
and
its
lake
below
me
these
things
are
not
like
things
seen
by
the
eyes
i
say
it
again
they
are
like
what
one
feels
when
music
is
played
i
entered
como
between
ten
and
eleven
faint
for
food
and
then
a
new
interest
came
to
fill
my
mind
with
memories
of
this
great
adventure
the
lake
was
in
flood
and
all
the
town
was
water
como
dry
must
be
interesting
enough
como
flooded
is
a
marvel
what
else
is
venice
and
here
is
a
venice
at
the
foot
of
high
mountains
and
in
the
water
no
streets
or
squares
a
fine
even
depth
of
three
feet
and
a
half
or
so
for
navigators
much
what
you
have
in
the
spitway
in
london
river
at
low
spring
tides
there
were
a
few
boats
about
but
the
traffic
and
pleasure
of
como
was
passing
along
planks
laid
on
trestles
over
the
water
here
and
there
like
bridges
and
for
those
who
were
in
haste
and
could
afford
it
such
as
take
cabs
in
london
there
were
wheelbarrows
coster
carts
and
what
not
pulled
about
by
men
for
hire
and
it
was
a
sight
to
remember
all
one
life
to
see
the
rich
men
of
como
squatting
on
these
carts
and
barrows
and
being
pulled
about
over
the
water
by
the
poor
men
of
como
being
indeed
an
epitome
of
all
modern
sociology
and
economics
and
religion
and
organized
charity
and
strenuousness
and
liberalism
and
sophistry
generally
for
my
part
i
was
determined
to
explore
this
curious
town
in
the
water
and
i
especially
desired
to
see
it
on
the
lake
side
because
there
one
would
get
the
best
impression
of
its
being
really
an
aquatic
town
so
i
went
northward
as
i
was
directed
and
came
quite
unexpectedly
upon
the
astonishing
cathedral
it
seemed
built
of
polished
marble
and
it
was
in
every
way
so
exquisite
in
proportion
so
delicate
in
sculpture
and
so
triumphant
in
attitude
that
i
thought
to
myself
wonder
men
praise
italy
if
this
first
italian
town
has
such
a
building
as
this
but
as
you
will
learn
later
many
of
the
things
praised
are
ugly
and
are
praised
only
by
certain
followers
of
charlatans
so
i
went
on
till
i
got
to
the
lake
and
there
i
found
a
little
port
about
as
big
as
a
for
the
italian
lakes
play
at
being
little
seas
they
have
little
ports
little
lighthouses
little
fleets
for
war
and
little
and
little
storms
and
little
lines
of
steamers
indeed
if
one
wanted
to
give
a
rich
child
a
perfect
model
or
toy
one
could
not
give
him
anything
better
than
an
italian
lake
and
when
i
had
long
gazed
at
the
town
standing
as
it
seemed
right
in
the
lake
i
felt
giddy
and
said
to
myself
is
the
lack
of
food
for
i
had
eaten
nothing
but
my
coffee
and
bread
eleven
miles
before
at
dawn
so
i
pulled
out
my
two
francs
and
going
into
a
little
shop
i
bought
bread
sausage
and
a
very
little
wine
for
fourpence
and
with
one
franc
eighty
left
i
stood
in
the
street
eating
and
wondering
what
my
next
step
should
be
it
seemed
on
the
map
perhaps
perhaps
miles
to
milan
it
was
now
nearly
noon
and
as
hot
as
could
be
i
might
if
i
held
out
cover
the
distance
in
eight
or
nine
hours
but
i
did
not
see
myself
walking
in
the
middle
heat
on
the
plain
of
lombardy
and
even
if
i
had
been
able
i
should
only
have
got
into
milan
at
dark
or
later
when
the
post
office
with
my
money
in
it
would
be
shut
and
where
could
i
sleep
for
my
one
franc
eighty
would
be
gone
a
man
covering
these
distances
must
have
one
good
meal
a
day
or
he
falls
ill
i
could
beg
but
there
was
the
risk
of
being
arrested
and
that
means
an
indefinite
waste
of
time
perhaps
several
days
and
time
that
had
defeated
me
at
the
gries
threatened
me
here
again
i
had
nothing
to
sell
or
to
pawn
and
i
had
no
friends
the
consul
i
would
not
attempt
i
knew
too
much
of
such
things
as
consuls
when
poor
and
dirty
men
try
them
besides
which
there
was
no
consul
i
pondered
i
went
into
the
cool
of
the
cathedral
to
sit
in
its
fine
darkness
and
think
better
i
sat
before
a
shrine
where
candles
were
burning
put
up
for
their
private
intentions
by
the
faithful
of
many
two
had
nearly
burnt
out
i
watched
them
in
their
slow
race
for
extinction
when
a
thought
took
me
will
said
i
to
myself
these
candles
for
an
ordeal
or
heavenly
judgement
the
left
hand
one
shall
be
for
attempting
the
road
at
the
risk
of
illness
or
very
dangerous
failure
the
right
hand
one
shall
stand
for
my
going
by
rail
till
i
come
to
that
point
on
the
railway
where
one
franc
eighty
will
take
me
and
thence
walking
into
milan
and
heaven
defend
the
right
they
were
a
long
time
going
out
and
they
fell
evenly
at
last
the
right
hand
one
shot
up
the
long
flame
that
precedes
the
death
of
candles
the
contest
took
on
interest
and
even
excitement
when
just
as
i
thought
the
left
hand
certain
of
winning
it
went
out
without
guess
or
warning
like
a
person
leaving
this
world
for
another
the
right
hand
candle
waved
its
flame
still
higher
as
though
in
triumph
outlived
its
colleague
just
the
moment
to
enjoy
glory
and
then
in
its
turn
went
fluttering
down
the
dark
way
from
which
they
say
there
is
no
return
none
may
protest
against
the
voice
of
the
gods
i
went
straight
to
the
nearest
railway
station
for
there
are
two
and
putting
down
one
franc
eighty
asked
in
french
for
a
ticket
to
whatever
station
that
sum
would
reach
down
the
line
the
ticket
came
out
marked
milan
and
i
admitted
the
miracle
and
confessed
the
finger
of
providence
there
was
no
change
and
as
i
got
into
the
train
i
had
become
that
rarest
and
ultimate
kind
of
traveller
the
man
without
any
money
whatsoever
without
passport
without
letters
without
food
or
wine
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
what
would
follow
if
the
train
broke
down
i
had
marched
miles
and
some
three
furlongs
or
thereabouts
thus
did
i
break
but
by
a
direct
command
the
last
and
dearest
of
my
vows
and
as
the
train
rumbled
off
i
took
luxury
in
the
rolling
wheels
i
thought
of
that
other
medieval
and
papistical
pilgrim
hobbling
along
rather
than
advantage
of
any
wheeled
thing
and
i
laughed
at
him
now
if
or
any
other
antichristian
statistical
man
and
scientist
sees
anything
remarkable
in
one
self
laughing
at
another
self
let
me
tell
him
and
all
such
for
their
edification
and
astonishment
that
i
knew
a
man
once
that
had
selves
there
would
have
been
but
for
the
poet
in
him
that
died
young
he
could
evolve
them
at
will
and
they
were
very
useful
to
lend
to
the
parish
priest
when
he
wished
to
make
up
a
respectable
procession
on
and
i
knew
another
man
that
could
make
himself
so
tall
as
to
look
over
the
heads
of
the
scientists
as
a
looks
over
grasses
and
again
so
small
as
to
discern
very
clearly
the
thick
coating
or
dust
of
wicked
pride
that
covers
them
up
in
a
fine
impenetrable
coat
so
much
for
the
moderns
the
train
rolled
on
i
noticed
lombardy
out
of
the
windows
it
is
flat
i
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
crowded
peasants
in
the
train
i
did
not
understand
it
i
twice
leaned
out
to
see
if
milan
were
not
standing
up
before
me
out
of
the
plain
but
i
saw
nothing
then
i
fell
asleep
and
when
i
woke
suddenly
it
was
because
we
were
in
the
terminus
of
that
noble
great
town
which
i
then
set
out
to
traverse
in
search
of
my
necessary
money
and
sustenance
it
was
yet
but
early
in
the
afternoon
what
a
magnificent
city
is
milan
the
great
houses
are
all
of
stone
and
stand
regular
and
in
order
along
wide
straight
streets
there
are
swift
cars
drawn
by
electricity
for
such
as
can
afford
them
men
are
brisk
and
alert
even
in
the
summer
heats
and
there
are
shops
of
a
very
good
kind
though
a
trifle
showy
there
are
many
newspapers
to
help
the
milanese
to
be
better
men
and
to
cultivate
charity
and
humility
there
are
banks
full
of
paper
money
there
are
soldiers
good
pavements
and
all
that
man
requires
to
fulfil
him
soul
and
body
cafés
arcades
mutoscopes
and
every
sign
of
the
perfect
state
and
the
whole
centres
in
a
splendid
open
square
in
the
midst
of
which
is
the
cathedral
which
is
justly
the
most
renowned
in
the
world
my
pilgrimage
is
to
rome
my
business
is
with
lonely
places
hills
and
the
recollection
of
the
spirit
it
would
be
waste
to
describe
at
length
this
mighty
capital
the
mists
and
the
woods
the
snows
and
the
interminable
way
had
left
me
for
the
place
and
i
was
ashamed
i
sat
outside
a
café
opposite
the
cathedral
watching
its
pinnacles
of
light
but
i
was
ashamed
perhaps
i
did
the
master
a
hurt
by
sitting
there
in
his
fine
great
café
unkempt
in
such
clothes
like
a
tramp
but
he
was
courteous
in
spite
of
his
riches
and
i
ordered
a
very
expensive
drink
for
him
also
in
order
to
make
amends
i
showed
him
my
sketches
and
told
him
of
my
adventures
in
french
and
he
was
kind
enough
to
sit
opposite
me
and
to
take
that
drink
with
me
he
talked
french
quite
easily
as
it
seems
do
all
such
men
in
the
principal
towns
of
north
italy
still
the
broad
day
shamed
me
and
only
when
darkness
came
did
i
feel
at
ease
i
wandered
in
the
streets
till
i
saw
a
small
eating
shop
and
there
i
took
a
good
meal
but
when
one
is
living
the
life
of
the
poor
one
sees
how
hard
are
the
great
cities
everything
was
dearer
and
worse
than
in
the
simple
countrysides
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
were
kindly
but
their
eyes
showed
that
they
had
often
to
suspect
men
they
gave
me
a
bed
but
it
was
a
franc
and
more
and
i
had
to
pay
before
going
upstairs
to
it
the
walls
were
mildewed
the
place
ramshackle
and
evil
the
rickety
bed
not
clean
the
door
broken
and
warped
and
that
night
i
was
oppressed
with
the
vision
of
poverty
dirt
and
clamour
and
inhuman
conditions
surrounded
me
yet
the
people
meant
well
with
the
first
light
i
got
up
quietly
glad
to
find
the
street
again
and
the
air
i
stood
in
the
crypt
of
the
cathedral
to
hear
the
ambrosian
mass
and
it
was
as
i
had
expected
like
any
other
save
for
a
kind
of
second
before
the
elevation
to
read
the
distorted
stupidity
of
the
north
one
might
have
imagined
that
in
the
ambrosian
ritual
the
priest
put
a
before
the
and
at
each
clause
of
it
and
renounced
his
baptismal
vows
at
the
but
the
milanese
are
catholics
like
any
others
and
the
northern
historians
are
either
liars
or
ignorant
men
and
i
know
three
that
are
both
together
then
i
set
out
down
the
long
street
that
leads
south
out
of
milan
and
was
soon
in
the
dull
and
sordid
suburb
of
the
piacenzan
way
the
sky
was
grey
the
air
chilly
and
in
a
little
while
alas
it
rained
lombardy
is
an
alluvial
plain
that
is
the
pretty
way
of
putting
it
the
truth
is
more
vivid
if
you
say
that
lombardy
is
as
flat
as
a
marsh
and
that
it
is
made
up
of
mud
of
course
this
mud
dries
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
but
mud
it
is
and
mud
it
will
remain
and
that
day
as
the
rain
began
falling
mud
it
rapidly
revealed
itself
to
be
and
the
more
did
it
seem
to
be
mud
when
one
saw
how
the
moistening
soil
showed
cracks
from
the
last
heat
lombardy
has
no
forests
but
any
amount
of
groups
of
trees
moreover
what
is
very
remarkable
it
is
all
cultivated
in
fields
more
or
less
square
these
fields
have
ditches
round
them
full
of
mud
and
water
running
slowly
and
some
of
them
are
themselves
under
water
in
order
to
cultivate
rice
all
these
fields
have
a
few
trees
bordering
them
apart
from
the
standing
clumps
but
these
trees
are
not
very
high
there
are
no
open
views
in
lombardy
and
lombardy
is
all
the
same
irregular
large
farmsteads
stand
at
random
all
up
and
down
the
country
no
square
mile
of
lombardy
is
empty
there
are
many
many
little
villages
many
straggling
small
towns
about
seven
to
eight
miles
apart
and
a
great
number
of
large
towns
from
thirty
to
fifty
miles
apart
indeed
this
very
road
to
piacenza
which
the
rain
now
covered
with
a
veil
of
despair
was
among
the
longest
stretches
between
any
two
large
towns
although
it
was
less
than
fifty
miles
on
the
map
before
coming
to
this
desolate
place
there
seemed
a
straighter
and
a
better
way
to
rome
than
this
great
road
there
is
a
river
called
the
lambro
which
comes
east
of
milan
and
cuts
the
piacenzan
road
at
a
place
called
melegnano
it
seemed
to
lead
straight
down
to
a
point
on
the
po
a
little
above
piacenza
this
stream
one
could
follow
so
it
seemed
and
when
it
joined
the
po
get
a
boat
or
ferry
and
see
on
the
other
side
the
famous
trebbia
where
hannibal
conquered
and
joubert
fell
and
so
make
straight
on
for
the
apennine
since
it
is
always
said
in
books
that
lombardy
is
a
furnace
in
summer
and
that
whole
great
armies
have
died
of
the
heat
there
this
river
bank
would
make
a
fine
refuge
clear
and
delicious
water
more
limpid
than
glass
would
reflect
and
echo
the
restless
poplars
and
would
make
tolerable
or
even
pleasing
the
excessive
summer
not
so
it
was
a
northern
mind
judging
by
northern
things
that
came
to
this
conclusion
there
is
not
in
all
lombardy
a
clear
stream
but
every
river
and
brook
is
rolling
mud
in
the
rain
not
heat
but
a
damp
and
penetrating
chill
was
the
danger
there
is
no
walking
on
the
banks
of
the
rivers
they
are
cliffs
of
crumbling
soil
jumbled
anyhow
man
may
as
pinkerton
sir
jonas
pinkerton
writes
be
master
of
his
fate
but
he
has
a
precious
poor
servant
it
is
easier
to
command
a
lapdog
or
a
mule
for
a
whole
day
than
one
own
fate
for
nevertheless
though
it
was
apparent
that
i
should
have
to
follow
the
main
road
for
a
while
i
determined
to
make
at
last
to
the
right
of
it
and
to
pass
through
a
place
called
lodi
for
i
reasoned
thus
is
the
famous
town
how
much
more
interesting
must
old
lodi
be
which
is
the
mothertown
of
lodi
also
old
lodi
brought
me
back
again
on
the
straight
line
to
rome
and
i
foolishly
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
hear
there
of
some
straight
path
down
the
lambro
for
that
river
still
possessed
me
somewhat
therefore
after
hours
and
hours
of
trudging
miserably
along
the
wide
highway
in
the
wretched
and
searching
rain
after
splashing
through
tortuous
melegnano
and
not
even
stopping
to
wonder
if
it
was
the
place
of
the
battle
after
noting
in
despair
the
impossible
lambro
i
came
caring
for
nothing
to
the
place
where
a
secondary
road
branches
off
to
the
right
over
a
level
crossing
and
makes
for
lodi
vecchio
it
was
not
nearly
midday
but
i
had
walked
perhaps
fifteen
miles
and
had
only
rested
once
in
a
miserable
trattoria
in
less
than
three
miles
i
came
to
that
unkempt
and
lengthy
village
founded
upon
dirt
and
living
in
misery
and
through
the
quiet
cold
persistent
rain
i
splashed
up
the
main
street
i
passed
wretched
shivering
dogs
and
mournful
fowls
that
took
a
poor
refuge
against
walls
passed
a
sad
horse
that
hung
its
head
in
the
wet
and
stood
waiting
for
a
master
till
at
last
i
reached
the
open
square
where
the
church
stood
then
i
knew
that
i
had
seen
all
old
lodi
had
to
offer
me
so
going
into
an
or
inn
opposite
the
church
i
found
a
girl
and
her
mother
serving
and
i
saluted
them
but
there
was
no
fire
and
my
heart
sank
to
the
level
of
that
room
which
was
i
am
sure
no
more
than
degrees
why
should
the
less
gracious
part
of
a
pilgrimage
be
specially
remembered
in
life
were
remember
joy
best
that
is
what
makes
us
sad
by
contrast
pain
somewhat
especially
if
it
is
acute
but
dulness
never
and
a
book
which
has
it
in
its
own
power
to
choose
and
to
emphasize
has
no
business
to
record
dulness
what
did
i
at
lodi
vecchio
i
ate
i
dried
my
clothes
before
a
tepid
stove
in
a
kitchen
i
tried
to
make
myself
understood
by
the
girl
and
her
mother
i
sat
at
a
window
and
drew
the
ugly
church
on
principle
oh
the
vile
sketch
worthy
of
that
lombard
plain
which
they
had
told
me
was
so
full
of
wonderful
things
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
and
i
determined
to
push
back
obliquely
to
the
highway
again
obliquely
in
order
to
save
time
nepios
these
of
the
map
turned
out
in
real
life
to
be
all
manner
of
abominable
tracks
some
few
were
metalled
some
were
merely
some
were
open
lanes
of
rank
grass
and
along
most
there
went
a
horrible
ditch
and
in
many
fields
the
standing
water
proclaimed
desolation
in
so
far
as
i
can
be
said
to
have
had
a
way
at
all
i
lost
it
i
could
not
ask
my
way
because
my
only
ultimate
goal
was
piacenza
and
that
was
far
off
i
did
not
know
the
name
of
any
place
between
two
or
three
groups
of
houses
i
passed
and
sometimes
church
towers
glimmered
through
the
rain
i
passed
a
larger
and
wider
road
than
the
rest
but
obviously
not
my
road
i
pressed
on
and
passed
another
and
by
this
time
having
ploughed
up
lombardy
for
some
four
hours
i
was
utterly
lost
i
no
longer
felt
the
north
and
for
all
i
knew
i
might
be
going
backwards
the
only
certain
thing
was
that
i
was
somewhere
in
the
belt
between
the
highroad
and
the
lambro
and
that
was
little
enough
to
know
at
the
close
of
such
a
day
grown
desperate
i
clamoured
within
my
mind
for
a
miracle
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
saw
a
little
bent
man
sitting
on
a
crazy
cart
and
going
ahead
of
me
at
a
pace
much
slower
than
a
walk
the
pace
of
a
horse
crawling
i
caught
him
up
and
doubting
much
whether
he
would
understand
a
word
i
said
to
him
repeatedly
granda
via
la
via
a
piacenza
he
shook
his
head
as
though
to
indicate
that
this
filthy
lane
was
not
the
road
just
as
i
had
despaired
of
learning
anything
he
pointed
with
his
arm
away
to
the
right
perpendicularly
to
the
road
we
were
on
and
nodded
he
moved
his
hand
up
and
down
i
had
been
going
north
on
getting
this
sign
i
did
not
wait
for
a
cross
road
but
jumped
the
little
ditch
and
pushed
through
long
grass
across
further
ditches
along
the
side
of
patches
of
growing
corn
heedless
of
the
huge
weight
on
my
boots
and
of
the
oozing
ground
till
i
saw
against
the
rainy
sky
a
line
of
telegraph
poles
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
made
the
sight
of
them
gave
a
man
joy
there
was
a
long
stagnant
pond
full
of
reeds
between
me
and
the
railroad
but
as
i
outflanked
it
i
came
upon
a
road
that
crossed
the
railway
at
a
level
and
led
me
into
the
great
piacenzan
way
almost
immediately
appeared
a
village
it
was
a
hole
called
secugnano
and
there
i
entered
a
house
where
a
bush
hanging
above
the
door
promised
entertainment
and
an
old
hobbling
woman
gave
me
food
and
drink
and
a
bed
the
night
had
fallen
and
upon
the
roof
above
me
i
could
hear
the
steady
rain
the
next
morning
heaven
preserve
the
world
from
evil
it
was
still
raining
lector
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
this
part
of
your
book
is
very
entertaining
auctor
i
know
that
but
what
am
i
to
do
lector
why
what
was
the
next
point
in
the
pilgrimage
that
was
even
tolerably
noteworthy
auctor
i
suppose
the
bridge
of
boats
lector
and
how
far
on
was
that
auctor
about
fourteen
miles
more
or
less
i
passed
through
a
town
with
a
name
as
long
as
my
arm
and
i
suppose
the
bridge
of
boats
must
have
been
nine
miles
on
after
that
lector
and
it
rained
all
the
time
and
there
was
mud

skip
it
and

poignancy

draw
my
inspiration

very
good
story

is
simple
and
full
of
plain
human
touches

how
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
everyday
life
it
requires

human
story

daily
task

very
true
my
dear

common
lot

story
it
is
about
the
hole
that
could
not
be

oldest
story

will

it
well
besides
which
i
promise
you
it
shall
never
be
told
again
i
will
copyright
it
well
once
there
was
a
learned
man
who
had
a
bargain
with
the
devil
that
he
should
warn
the
devil
emissaries
of
all
the
good
deeds
done
around
him
so
that
they
could
be
upset
and
he
in
turn
was
to
have
all
those
pleasant
things
of
this
life
which
the
devil
allies
usually
get
to
wit
a
comfortable
home
good
health
money
for
one
rank
and
generally
what
is
called
happy
useful
life
midnight
of
in
the
last
year
of
the
nineteenth
century
so
this
learned
man
did
all
he
was
required
and
daily
would
inform
the
messenger
imps
of
the
good
being
done
or
prepared
in
the
neighbourhood
and
they
would
upset
it
so
that
the
place
he
lived
in
from
a
nice
country
town
became
a
great
centre
of
industry
full
of
wealth
and
desirable
family
mansions
and
street
property
and
was
called
in
hell
b
depot
a
you
may
guess
at
but
at
last
toward
the
of
october
the
learned
man
began
to
shake
in
his
shoes
and
to
dread
the
judgement
for
you
see
he
had
not
the
comfortable
ignorance
of
his
kind
and
was
compelled
to
believe
in
the
devil
and
as
i
say
he
shook
in
his
shoes
so
he
bethought
him
of
a
plan
to
cheat
the
devil
and
the
day
before
he
cut
a
very
small
round
hole
in
the
floor
of
his
study
just
near
the
fireplace
right
through
down
to
the
cellar
then
he
got
a
number
of
things
that
do
great
harm
newspapers
legal
documents
unpaid
bills
and
so
forth
and
made
ready
for
action
next
morning
when
the
little
imps
came
for
orders
as
usual
after
prayers
he
took
them
down
into
the
cellar
and
pointing
out
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
he
said
to
them
friends
this
little
hole
is
a
mystery
it
communicates
i
believe
with
the
chapel
but
i
can
not
find
the
exit
all
i
know
is
that
some
pious
person
or
angel
or
what
not
desirous
to
do
good
slips
into
it
every
day
whatever
he
thinks
may
be
a
cause
of
evil
in
the
neighbourhood
hoping
thus
to
destroy
it
in
proof
of
which
statement
he
showed
them
a
scattered
heap
of
newspapers
on
the
floor
of
the
cellar
beneath
the
hole
the
best
thing
you
can
do
he
added
to
stay
here
and
take
them
away
as
far
as
they
come
down
and
put
them
back
into
circulation
again
tut
tut
he
added
picking
up
a
moneylender
threatening
letter
to
a
widow
is
astonishing
how
these
people
interfere
with
the
most
sacred
rights
here
is
a
letter
actually
stolen
from
the
post
pray
see
that
it
is
delivered
so
he
left
the
little
imps
at
work
and
fed
them
from
above
with
all
manner
of
things
which
they
as
promptly
drew
into
the
cellar
and
at
intervals
flew
away
with
to
put
them
into
circulation
again
that
evening
at
about
eleven
the
devil
came
to
fetch
the
learned
man
and
found
him
seated
at
his
fine
great
desk
writing
the
learned
man
got
up
very
affably
to
receive
the
devil
and
offered
him
a
chair
by
the
fire
just
near
the
little
round
hole
do
move
said
the
devil
came
early
on
purpose
not
to
disturb
you
are
very
good
replied
the
learned
man
fact
is
i
have
to
finish
my
report
on
lady
grope
settlement
among
our
poor
in
the
bull
ring
it
is
making
some
progress
but
their
condition
is
my
dear
sir
can
well
believe
it
said
the
devil
sadly
and
solemnly
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
pressing
his
hands
together
like
a
roof
poor
in
our
great
towns
sir
charles
for
the
learned
man
had
been
made
a
baronet
condition
i
say
of
the
do
i
feel
a
draught
he
added
abruptly
for
the
devil
ca
bear
draughts
said
the
learned
man
as
though
ashamed
near
your
chair
there
a
little
hole
that
i
have
done
my
best
to
fill
up
but
somehow
it
seemed
impossible
to
fill
it
i
do
know
the
devil
hates
excuses
and
is
above
all
practical
so
he
just
whipped
the
soul
of
a
lawyer
out
of
his
tied
a
knot
in
it
to
stiffen
it
and
shoved
it
into
the
hole
said
the
devil
contentedly
you
had
taken
a
piece
of
rag
or
what
not
you
might
yourself
hulloa
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
hole
still
gaping
and
he
felt
a
furious
draught
coming
up
again
he
wondered
a
little
and
then
muttered
a
pity
i
have
on
my
best
things
i
never
dare
crease
them
and
i
have
nothing
in
my
pockets
to
speak
of
otherwise
i
might
have
brought
something
bigger
he
felt
in
his
trouser
pocket
and
fished
out
a
pedant
crumpled
him
carefully
into
a
ball
and
stuffed
him
hard
into
the
hole
so
that
he
suffered
agonies
then
the
devil
watched
carefully
the
soul
of
the
pedant
was
at
first
tugged
as
if
from
below
then
drawn
slowly
down
and
finally
shot
off
out
of
sight
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
said
the
devil
is
the
draught
it
is
very
strong
between
the
joists
ventured
the
learned
man
ends
shouted
the
devil
is
a
trick
but
never
been
caught
yet
and
i
never
will
be
he
clapped
his
hands
and
a
whole
host
of
his
followers
poured
in
through
the
windows
with
mortgages
acts
of
parliament
legal
decisions
declarations
of
war
charters
to
universities
patents
for
medicines
naturalization
orders
shares
in
gold
mines
specifications
prospectuses
water
companies
reports
agreements
letters
patent
freedoms
of
cities
and
in
a
word
all
that
the
devil
controls
in
the
way
of
rubbish
and
the
devil
kneeling
on
the
floor
stuffed
them
into
the
hole
like
a
madman
but
as
fast
as
he
stuffed
the
little
imps
below
who
had
summoned
a
number
of
their
kind
to
their
aid
also
pulled
it
through
and
carted
it
away
and
the
devil
like
one
possessed
lashed
the
floor
with
his
tail
and
his
eyes
glared
like
coals
of
fire
and
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
and
he
breathed
hard
and
pushed
every
imaginable
thing
he
had
into
the
hole
so
swiftly
that
at
last
his
documents
and
parchments
looked
like
streaks
and
flashes
but
the
loyal
little
imps
not
to
be
beaten
drew
them
through
into
the
cellar
as
fast
as
machinery
and
whirled
them
to
their
assistants
and
all
the
poor
lost
souls
who
had
been
pressed
into
the
service
were
groaning
that
their
one
holiday
in
the
year
was
being
filched
from
them
when
just
as
the
process
was
going
on
so
fast
that
it
roared
like
a
in
full
blast
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
twelve
the
devil
suddenly
stopped
and
stood
up
of
my
house
said
the
learned
man
of
my
house
i
had
enough
of
you
and
i
no
time
for
it
past
twelve
and
i
won
the
devil
though
still
panting
smiled
a
diabolical
smile
and
pulling
out
his
repeater
which
he
had
taken
as
a
perquisite
from
the
body
of
a
member
of
parliament
said
suppose
you
keep
greenwich
time
said
sir
charles
said
the
devil
much
the
worse
for
you
to
live
in
suffolk
you
four
minutes
fast
so
i
trouble
you
to
come
along
with
me
and
i
warn
you
that
any
words
you
now
say
may
be
used
against
at
this
point
the
learned
man
patron
saint
who
thought
things
had
gone
far
enough
materialized
himself
and
coughed
gently
they
both
looked
round
and
there
was
st
charles
sitting
in
the
easy
chair
far
murmured
the
saint
to
the
devil
suavely
far
from
being
four
minutes
too
early
you
are
exactly
a
year
too
late
on
saying
this
the
saint
smiled
a
genial
priestly
smile
folded
his
hands
twiddled
his
thumbs
slowly
round
and
round
and
gazed
in
a
fatherly
way
at
the
devil
do
you
mean
shouted
the
devil
i
say
said
st
charles
calmly
is
not
the
last
year
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
the
first
year
of
the
twentieth
sneered
the
devil
you
an
as
well
now
look
here
and
he
began
counting
on
his
fingers
in
the
year
never
argue
said
st
charles
all
i
know
is
answered
the
devil
with
some
heat
in
this
matter
as
in
most
others
thank
the
lord
i
have
on
my
side
all
the
historians
and
all
the
scientists
all
the
universities
all
the
i
interrupted
st
charles
waving
his
hand
like
a
gentleman
he
is
a
borromeo
have
the
pope
at
this
the
devil
gave
a
great
howl
and
disappeared
in
a
clap
of
thunder
and
was
never
seen
again
till
his
recent
appearance
at
brighton
so
the
learned
man
was
saved
but
hardly
for
he
had
to
spend
five
hundred
years
in
purgatory
catechizing
such
heretics
and
pagans
as
got
there
and
instructing
them
in
the
true
faith
and
with
the
more
muscular
he
passed
a
knotty
time
you
do
not
see
the
river
po
till
you
are
close
to
it
then
a
little
crook
in
the
road
being
passed
you
come
between
high
trees
and
straight
out
before
you
level
with
you
runs
the
road
into
and
over
a
very
wide
mass
of
tumbling
water
it
does
not
look
like
a
bridge
it
looks
like
a
quay
it
does
not
rise
it
has
all
the
appearance
of
being
a
strip
of
road
shaved
off
and
floated
on
the
water
all
this
is
because
it
passes
over
boats
as
do
some
bridges
over
the
rhine
at
cologne
i
believe
and
certainly
at
kiel
for
i
once
sat
at
the
end
of
that
and
saw
a
lot
of
sad
german
soldiers
drilling
a
memory
which
later
made
me
understand
why
they
can
be
by
latins
why
they
impress
travellers
and
civilians
why
the
governing
class
in
germany
take
care
to
avoid
common
service
why
there
is
no
promotion
from
the
ranks
and
why
their
artillery
is
too
rigid
and
not
quick
enough
it
also
showed
me
something
intimate
and
fundamental
about
the
germans
which
tacitus
never
understood
and
which
all
our
historians
miss
they
are
histrionic
note
i
do
not
say
it
is
a
vice
of
theirs
it
is
a
necessity
of
theirs
an
appetite
they
must
see
themselves
on
a
stage
whether
they
do
things
well
or
ill
whether
it
is
their
excellent
army
with
its
ridiculous
parade
or
their
with
avenues
and
surprises
or
their
national
legends
with
gods
in
wigs
and
strong
men
in
tights
they
be
to
be
happy
and
therefore
to
be
efficient
and
if
i
were
lord
of
germany
and
desired
to
lead
my
nation
and
to
be
loved
by
them
i
should
put
great
golden
feathers
on
my
helmet
i
should
use
rhetorical
expressions
spout
monologues
in
public
organize
wide
cavalry
charges
at
reviews
and
move
through
life
generally
to
the
crashing
of
an
orchestra
for
by
doing
this
even
a
vulgar
short
and
diseased
man
who
dabbled
in
stocks
and
shares
and
was
led
by
financiers
could
become
a
hero
and
do
his
nation
good
lector
what
is
all
this
auctor
it
is
a
parenthesis
lector
it
is
good
to
know
the
names
of
the
strange
things
one
meets
with
on
one
travels
auctor
so
i
return
to
where
i
branched
off
and
tell
you
that
the
river
po
is
here
crossed
by
a
bridge
of
boats
it
is
a
very
large
stream
across
it
is
even
a
trifle
uncomfortable
to
be
so
near
the
rush
of
the
water
on
the
trembling
pontoons
and
on
that
day
its
speed
and
turbulence
were
emphasized
by
the
falling
rain
for
the
marks
of
the
rain
on
the
water
showed
the
rapidity
of
the
current
and
the
silence
of
its
fall
framed
and
enhanced
the
swirl
of
the
great
river
once
across
it
is
a
step
up
into
piacenza
a
step
through
mud
and
rain
on
my
right
was
that
plain
where
barbarossa
received
and
was
glorified
by
the
rising
life
of
the
twelfth
century
there
the
renaissance
of
our
europe
saw
the
future
glorious
for
the
first
time
since
the
twilight
of
rome
and
being
full
of
morning
they
imagined
a
new
earth
and
gave
it
a
lord
it
was
at
roncaglia
i
think
in
spring
and
i
wish
i
had
been
there
for
in
spring
even
the
lombard
plain
they
say
is
beautiful
and
generous
but
in
summer
i
know
by
experience
that
it
is
cold
brutish
and
wet
and
so
in
piacenza
it
rained
and
there
was
mud
till
i
came
to
a
hotel
called
the
moor
head
in
a
very
narrow
street
and
entering
it
i
discovered
a
curious
thing
the
italians
live
in
palaces
i
might
have
known
it
they
are
the
impoverished
heirs
of
a
great
time
its
garments
cling
to
them
but
their
rooms
are
too
large
for
the
modern
penury
i
found
these
men
eating
in
a
great
corridor
in
a
hall
as
they
might
do
in
a
palace
i
found
high
painted
ceilings
and
many
things
of
marble
a
vast
kitchen
and
all
the
apparatus
of
the
great
houses
at
the
service
of
a
handful
of
contented
unknown
men
so
in
england
when
we
have
worked
out
our
full
fate
happier
but
poorer
men
will
sit
in
the
faded
a
community
or
an
inn
or
impoverished
squires
and
rough
food
will
be
eaten
under
mouldering
great
pictures
and
there
will
be
offices
or
granaries
in
the
galleries
of
our
castles
and
where
lord
saxonthorpe
whose
real
name
is
hauptstein
now
plans
our
policy
common
englishmen
will
return
to
the
simpler
life
and
there
will
be
dogs
and
beer
and
catches
upon
winter
evenings
for
italy
also
once
gathered
by
artifice
the
wealth
that
was
not
of
her
making
he
was
a
good
man
the
innkeeper
of
this
palace
he
warmed
me
at
his
fire
in
his
enormous
kitchen
and
i
drank
malaga
to
the
health
of
the
cooks
i
ate
of
their
food
i
bought
a
bottle
of
a
new
kind
of
sweet
wine
called
dolce
and
i
took
the
road
lector
and
did
you
see
nothing
of
piacenza
auctor
nothing
lector
it
was
raining
and
there
was
mud
i
stood
in
front
of
the
cathedral
on
my
way
out
and
watched
it
rain
it
rained
all
along
the
broad
and
splendid
emilian
way
i
had
promised
myself
great
visions
of
the
roman
soldiery
passing
up
that
eternal
road
it
still
was
stamped
with
the
imperial
mark
but
the
rain
washed
out
its
interest
and
left
me
cold
the
apennines
also
rising
abruptly
from
the
plain
were
to
have
given
me
revelations
at
sunset
they
gave
me
none
their
foothills
appeared
continually
on
my
right
they
themselves
were
veiled
and
all
these
miles
of
road
fade
into
the
confused
memory
of
that
intolerable
plain
the
night
at
firenzuola
the
morning
the
second
morning
of
this
visitation
still
cold
still
heartless
and
sodden
with
the
abominable
weather
shall
form
no
part
of
this
book
things
grand
and
simple
of
their
nature
are
possessed
as
you
know
of
a
very
subtle
flavour
the
larger
music
the
more
majestic
lengths
of
verse
called
epics
the
exact
in
sculpture
the
classic
drama
the
most
absolute
kinds
of
wine
require
a
perfect
harmony
of
circumstance
for
their
appreciation
whatever
is
strong
poignant
and
immediate
in
its
effect
is
not
so
difficult
to
suit
farce
horror
rage
or
what
not
these
a
man
can
find
in
the
arts
even
when
his
mood
may
be
heavy
or
disturbed
just
as
to
take
their
parallel
in
wines
strong
beaune
will
always
rouse
a
man
but
that
which
is
cousin
to
the
immortal
spirit
and
which
has
so
to
speak
no
colour
but
mere
light
needs
for
its
recognition
so
serene
an
air
of
abstraction
and
of
content
as
makes
its
pleasure
seem
rare
in
this
troubled
life
and
causes
us
to
recall
it
like
a
descent
of
the
gods
for
who
having
noise
around
him
can
strike
the
table
with
pleasure
at
reading
the
misanthrope
or
in
mere
thirst
or
in
fatigue
praise
chinon
wine
who
does
not
need
for
either
of
these
perfect
things
recollection
a
variety
of
according
conditions
and
a
certain
easy
plenitude
of
the
mind
so
it
is
with
the
majesty
of
plains
and
with
the
haunting
power
of
their
imperial
roads
all
you
that
have
had
your
souls
touched
at
the
innermost
and
have
attempted
to
release
yourselves
in
verse
and
have
written
trash
and
who
know
it
be
comforted
you
shall
have
satisfaction
at
last
and
you
shall
attain
fame
in
some
other
fashion
perhaps
in
private
theatricals
or
perhaps
in
journalism
you
will
be
granted
a
prevision
of
complete
success
and
your
hearts
shall
be
filled
but
you
must
not
expect
to
find
this
mood
on
the
emilian
way
when
it
is
raining
all
you
that
feel
youth
slipping
past
you
and
that
are
desolate
at
the
approach
of
age
be
merry
it
is
not
what
it
looks
like
from
in
front
and
from
outside
there
is
a
glory
in
all
completion
and
all
good
endings
are
but
shining
transitions
there
will
come
a
sharp
moment
of
revelation
when
you
shall
bless
the
effect
of
time
but
this
divine
moment
it
is
not
on
the
emilian
way
in
the
rain
that
you
should
seek
it
all
you
that
have
loved
passionately
and
have
torn
your
hearts
asunder
in
disillusions
do
not
imagine
that
things
broken
can
not
be
mended
by
the
good
angels
there
is
a
kind
of
splice
called
long
which
makes
a
cut
rope
seem
what
it
was
before
it
is
even
stronger
than
before
and
can
pass
through
a
block
there
will
descend
upon
you
a
blessed
hour
when
you
will
be
convinced
as
by
a
miracle
and
you
will
suddenly
understand
the
amoris
amoris
redintegratio
a
latin
phrase
but
this
hour
you
will
not
receive
in
the
rain
on
the
emilian
way
here
then
next
day
just
outside
a
town
called
borgo
past
the
middle
of
morning
the
rain
ceased
its
effect
was
still
upon
the
slippery
and
shining
road
the
sky
was
still
fast
and
leaden
when
in
a
distaste
for
their
towns
i
skirted
the
place
by
a
lane
that
runs
westward
of
the
houses
and
sitting
upon
a
low
wall
i
looked
up
at
the
apennines
which
were
now
plain
above
me
and
thought
over
my
approaching
passage
through
those
hills
but
here
i
must
make
clear
by
a
map
the
mass
of
mountains
which
i
was
about
to
attempt
and
in
which
i
forded
so
many
rivers
met
so
many
strange
men
and
beasts
saw
such
unaccountable
sights
was
imprisoned
starved
frozen
haunted
delighted
burnt
up
and
finally
refreshed
in
tuscany
in
a
word
where
i
had
the
most
extraordinary
and
adventures
that
ever
diversified
the
life
of
man
the
straight
line
to
rome
runs
from
milan
not
quite
through
piacenza
but
within
a
mile
or
two
of
that
city
then
it
runs
across
the
first
folds
of
the
apennines
and
gradually
diverges
from
the
emilian
way
it
was
not
possible
to
follow
this
part
of
the
line
exactly
for
there
was
no
kind
of
track
but
by
following
the
emilian
way
for
several
miles
as
i
had
done
and
by
leaving
it
at
the
right
moment
it
was
possible
to
strike
the
straight
line
again
near
a
village
called
medesano
now
on
the
far
side
of
the
apennines
beyond
their
main
crest
there
happens
most
providentially
to
be
a
river
called
the
serchio
whose
valley
is
fairly
straight
and
points
down
directly
to
rome
to
follow
this
valley
would
be
practically
to
follow
the
line
to
rome
and
it
struck
the
tuscan
plain
not
far
from
lucca
but
to
get
from
the
emilian
way
over
the
eastern
slope
of
the
apennines
main
ridge
and
crest
to
where
the
serchio
rises
on
the
western
side
is
a
very
difficult
matter
the
few
roads
across
the
apennines
cut
my
track
at
right
angles
and
were
therefore
useless
in
order
to
strike
the
watershed
at
the
sources
of
the
serchio
it
was
necessary
to
go
obliquely
across
a
torrent
and
four
rivers
the
taro
the
parma
the
enza
and
the
secchia
and
to
climb
the
four
spurs
that
divided
them
crossing
each
nearer
to
the
principal
chain
as
i
advanced
until
after
the
secchia
the
next
climb
would
be
that
of
the
central
crest
itself
on
the
far
side
of
which
i
should
find
the
serchio
valley
perhaps
in
places
roads
might
correspond
to
this
track
certainly
the
bulk
of
it
would
be
or
rough
gullies
how
much
i
could
not
tell
the
only
way
i
could
work
it
with
my
wretched
map
was
to
note
the
names
of
towns
or
hamlets
more
or
less
on
the
line
and
to
pick
my
way
from
one
to
another
i
wrote
them
down
as
follows
fornovo
calestano
tizzano
colagna
the
last
at
the
foot
of
the
final
pass
the
distance
to
that
pass
as
the
crow
flies
was
only
a
little
more
than
thirty
miles
so
exceedingly
difficult
was
the
task
that
it
took
me
over
two
days
till
i
reached
fornovo
beyond
the
taro
i
was
not
really
in
the
hills
by
country
roads
picking
my
way
i
made
that
afternoon
for
medesano
the
lanes
were
tortuous
they
crossed
continual
streams
that
ran
from
the
hills
above
full
and
foaming
after
the
rain
and
frothing
with
the
waste
of
the
mountains
i
had
not
gone
two
miles
when
the
sky
broke
not
four
when
a
new
warmth
began
to
steal
over
the
air
and
a
sense
of
summer
to
appear
in
the
earth
about
me
with
the
greatest
rapidity
the
unusual
weather
that
had
accompanied
me
from
milan
was
changing
into
the
normal
brilliancy
of
the
south
but
it
was
too
late
for
the
sun
to
tell
though
he
shone
from
time
to
time
through
clouds
that
were
now
moving
eastwards
more
perceptibly
and
shredding
as
they
moved
quite
tired
and
desiring
food
keen
also
for
rest
after
those
dispiriting
days
i
stopped
before
reaching
medesano
at
an
inn
where
three
ways
met
and
there
i
purposed
to
eat
and
spend
the
night
for
the
next
day
it
was
easy
to
see
would
be
tropical
and
i
should
rise
before
dawn
if
i
was
to
save
the
heat
i
entered
the
room
within
was
of
red
wood
it
had
two
tables
a
little
counter
with
a
vast
array
of
bottles
a
woman
behind
the
counter
and
a
small
nervous
man
in
a
strange
hat
serving
and
all
the
little
place
was
filled
and
crammed
with
a
crowd
of
perhaps
twenty
men
gesticulating
shouting
laughing
quarrelling
and
one
very
big
man
was
explaining
to
another
the
virtues
of
his
knife
and
all
were
already
amply
satisfied
with
wine
for
in
this
part
men
do
not
own
but
are
paid
wages
so
that
they
waste
the
little
they
have
i
saluted
the
company
and
walking
up
to
the
counter
was
about
to
call
for
wine
they
had
all
become
silent
when
one
man
asked
me
a
question
in
italian
i
did
not
understand
it
and
attempted
to
say
so
when
another
asked
the
same
question
then
six
or
seven
and
there
was
a
hubbub
and
out
of
the
hubbub
i
heard
a
similar
sentence
rising
all
the
time
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
what
it
meant
but
i
thought
and
think
it
meant
is
a
venetian
or
is
the
venetian
something
in
my
broken
language
had
made
them
think
this
and
evidently
the
venetians
or
a
venetian
were
or
was
gravely
unpopular
here
why
i
can
not
tell
perhaps
the
venetians
were
blacklegs
but
evidently
a
venetian
or
the
whole
venetian
nation
had
recently
done
them
a
wrong
at
any
rate
one
very
man
put
his
face
close
up
to
mine
unlipped
his
teeth
and
began
a
great
noise
of
cursing
and
threatening
and
this
so
angered
me
that
it
overmastered
my
fear
which
had
till
then
been
considerable
i
remembered
also
a
rule
which
a
wise
man
once
told
me
for
guidance
and
it
is
this
disposes
of
victory
but
as
the
world
is
made
when
men
smile
smile
when
men
laugh
laugh
when
men
hit
hit
when
men
shout
shout
and
when
men
curse
curse
you
also
my
son
and
in
doubt
let
them
always
take
the
first
move
i
say
my
fear
had
been
considerable
especially
of
the
man
with
the
knife
but
i
got
too
angry
to
remember
it
and
advancing
my
face
also
to
this
insulter
i
shouted
ladro
dios
di
mi
alma
sanguinamento
nombre
di
dios
che
che
vole
non
sono
da
venezia
io
sono
de
francia
je
fiche
da
vestra
venezia
non
se
vede
che
non
parlar
vestra
lingua
che
sono
forestiere
and
so
forth
at
this
they
evidently
divided
into
two
parties
and
all
began
raging
amongst
themselves
and
some
at
me
while
the
others
argued
louder
and
louder
that
there
was
an
error
the
little
innkeeper
caught
my
arm
over
the
counter
and
i
turned
round
sharply
thinking
he
was
doing
me
a
wrong
but
i
saw
him
nodding
and
winking
at
me
and
he
was
on
my
side
this
was
probably
because
he
was
responsible
if
anything
happened
and
he
alone
could
not
fly
from
the
police
he
made
them
a
speech
which
for
all
i
know
may
have
been
to
the
effect
that
he
had
known
and
loved
me
from
childhood
or
may
have
been
that
he
knew
me
for
one
jacques
of
turin
or
may
have
been
any
other
lie
whatever
lie
it
was
it
appeased
them
their
anger
went
down
to
a
murmur
just
like
settling
down
into
a
glass
i
stood
wine
we
drank
i
showed
them
my
book
and
as
my
pencil
needed
sharpening
the
large
man
lent
me
his
knife
for
courtesy
when
i
got
it
in
my
hand
i
saw
plainly
that
it
was
no
knife
for
stabbing
with
it
was
a
and
would
have
bit
the
hand
that
cherished
it
as
they
say
of
serpents
on
the
other
hand
it
would
have
been
a
good
knife
for
ripping
and
passable
at
a
slash
you
must
not
expect
too
much
of
one
article
i
took
food
but
i
saw
that
in
this
parish
it
was
safer
to
sleep
out
of
doors
than
in
so
in
the
falling
evening
but
not
yet
sunset
i
wandered
on
not
at
a
pace
but
looking
for
shelter
and
i
found
at
last
just
what
i
wanted
a
little
shed
with
dried
ferns
as
it
seemed
strewed
in
a
corner
a
few
old
sacks
and
a
broken
piece
of
machinery
though
this
last
was
of
no
use
to
me
i
thought
will
be
safe
here
for
i
shall
rise
before
day
and
the
owner
if
there
is
one
will
not
disturb
me
the
air
was
fairly
warm
the
place
quite
dry
the
open
side
looked
westward
and
a
little
south
the
sun
had
now
set
behind
the
apennines
and
there
was
a
deep
effulgence
in
the
sky
i
drank
a
little
wine
lit
a
pipe
and
watched
the
west
in
silence
whatever
was
left
of
the
great
pall
from
which
all
that
rain
had
fallen
now
was
banked
up
on
the
further
side
of
heaven
in
toppling
great
clouds
that
caught
the
full
glow
of
evening
the
great
clouds
stood
up
in
heaven
separate
like
persons
and
no
wind
blew
but
everything
was
full
of
evening
i
worshipped
them
so
far
as
it
is
permitted
to
worship
inanimate
things
they
domed
into
the
pure
light
of
the
higher
air
inviolable
they
seemed
halted
in
the
presence
of
a
commanding
majesty
who
ranked
them
all
in
order
this
vision
filled
me
with
a
large
calm
which
a
travelled
man
may
find
on
coming
to
his
home
or
a
learner
in
the
communion
of
wise
men
repose
certitude
and
as
it
were
a
premonition
of
glory
occupied
my
spirit
before
it
was
yet
quite
dark
i
had
made
a
bed
out
of
the
dry
bracken
covered
myself
with
the
sacks
and
cloths
and
very
soon
i
fell
asleep
still
thinking
of
the
shapes
of
clouds
and
of
the
power
of
god
next
morning
it
was
as
i
had
thought
going
out
before
it
was
fully
light
a
dense
mist
all
around
and
a
clear
sky
showed
what
the
day
was
to
be
as
i
reached
medesano
the
sun
rose
and
in
the
air
was
instinct
with
heat
within
an
hour
it
was
blinding
an
early
mass
in
the
church
below
the
village
prepared
my
day
but
as
i
took
coffee
afterwards
in
a
little
inn
and
asked
about
crossing
the
taro
to
fornovo
my
first
point
to
my
astonishment
they
shook
their
heads
the
taro
was
impassable
why
could
it
not
be
crossed
my
very
broken
language
made
it
difficult
for
me
to
understand
they
talked
which
i
thought
meant
oars
but
had
i
known
it
meant
the
separate
branches
or
streams
whereby
these
torrential
rivers
of
italy
flow
through
their
arid
beds
i
drew
a
boat
and
asked
if
one
could
not
cross
in
that
for
i
was
a
northerner
and
my
idea
of
a
river
was
a
river
with
banks
and
water
in
between
but
they
laughed
and
said
then
i
made
the
motion
of
swimming
they
said
it
was
impossible
and
one
man
hung
his
head
to
indicate
drowning
it
was
serious
they
said
or
rather
next
day
one
might
do
it
finally
a
boy
that
stood
by
said
he
remembered
a
man
who
knew
the
river
better
than
any
one
and
he
if
any
one
could
would
get
me
across
so
i
took
the
boy
with
me
up
the
road
and
as
we
went
i
saw
parallel
to
the
road
a
wide
plain
of
dazzling
rocks
and
sand
and
beyond
it
shining
and
silhouetted
like
an
arab
village
the
group
of
houses
that
was
fornovo
this
plain
was
their
sort
of
river
in
these
hills
the
boy
said
that
sometimes
it
was
full
and
a
mile
wide
sometimes
it
dwindled
into
dirty
pools
now
as
i
looked
a
few
thin
streams
seemed
to
wind
through
it
and
i
could
not
understand
the
danger
after
a
mile
or
two
we
came
to
a
spot
in
the
road
where
a
patch
of
brushwood
only
separated
us
from
the
here
the
boy
bade
me
wait
and
asked
a
group
of
peasants
whether
the
guide
was
in
they
said
they
thought
so
and
some
went
up
into
the
hillside
with
the
boy
to
fetch
him
others
remained
with
me
looking
at
the
and
at
fornovo
beyond
shaking
their
heads
and
saying
it
had
not
been
done
for
days
but
i
did
not
understand
whether
the
had
passed
and
was
draining
away
or
whether
it
had
not
yet
come
down
from
beyond
and
i
waited
for
the
guide
they
brought
him
at
last
down
from
his
hut
among
the
hills
he
came
with
great
strides
a
man
extremely
tall
and
thin
and
with
very
pale
eyes
he
smiled
they
pointed
me
out
to
him
and
we
struck
the
bargain
by
holding
up
three
fingers
each
for
three
lira
and
nodding
then
he
grasped
his
long
staff
and
i
mine
we
bade
farewell
to
the
party
and
together
we
went
in
silence
through
thick
brushwood
down
towards
the
broad
the
stones
of
it
glared
like
the
sands
of
africa
fornovo
baked
under
the
sun
all
white
and
black
between
us
was
this
broad
plain
of
parched
shingle
and
rocks
that
could
in
a
night
become
one
enormous
river
or
dwindle
to
a
chain
of
stagnant
ponds
some
seven
narrow
streams
wandered
in
the
expanse
and
again
they
seemed
so
easy
to
cross
that
again
i
wondered
at
the
need
of
a
guide
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
first
and
i
climbed
on
the
guide
back
he
went
into
the
stream
deeper
and
deeper
till
my
feet
though
held
up
high
just
touched
the
water
then
laboriously
he
climbed
the
further
shore
and
i
got
down
upon
dry
land
it
had
been
but
twenty
yards
or
so
and
he
knew
the
place
well
i
had
seen
as
we
crossed
what
a
torrent
this
first
little
stream
was
and
i
now
knew
the
difficulty
and
understood
the
warnings
of
the
inn
the
second
branch
was
impassable
we
followed
it
up
for
nearly
a
mile
to
where
island
that
is
a
mass
of
high
land
that
must
have
been
an
island
in
and
that
had
on
it
an
old
brown
village
stood
above
the
white
bed
of
the
river
just
at
this
my
guide
found
a
ford
and
the
way
he
found
it
is
worth
telling
he
taught
me
the
trick
and
it
is
most
useful
to
men
who
wander
alone
in
mountains
you
take
a
heavy
stone
how
heavy
you
must
learn
to
judge
for
a
more
rapid
current
needs
a
heavier
stone
but
say
about
ten
pounds
this
you
lob
gently
into
it
is
impossible
to
describe
but
when
you
do
it
it
is
quite
easy
to
see
that
in
about
four
feet
of
water
or
less
the
stone
splashes
quite
differently
from
the
way
it
does
in
five
feet
or
more
it
is
a
sure
test
and
one
much
easier
to
acquire
by
practice
than
to
write
about
to
teach
myself
this
trick
i
practised
it
throughout
my
journey
in
these
wilds
having
found
a
ford
then
he
again
took
me
on
his
shoulders
but
in
the
water
being
up
to
his
breast
his
foot
slipped
on
a
stone
all
the
bed
beneath
was
rolling
and
churning
in
the
torrent
and
in
a
moment
we
had
both
fallen
he
pulled
me
up
straight
by
his
side
and
then
indeed
overwhelmed
in
the
rush
of
water
it
was
easy
to
understand
how
the
taro
could
drown
men
and
why
the
peasants
dreaded
these
little
ribbons
of
water
the
current
rushed
and
foamed
past
me
coming
nearly
to
my
neck
and
it
was
icy
cold
one
had
to
lean
against
it
and
the
water
so
took
away
one
weight
that
at
any
moment
one
might
have
slipped
and
been
carried
away
the
guide
a
much
taller
man
indeed
he
was
six
foot
three
or
so
supported
me
holding
my
arm
and
again
in
a
moment
we
reached
dry
land
after
that
adventure
there
was
no
need
for
carrying
the
third
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
branches
were
easily
fordable
the
seventh
was
broad
and
deep
and
i
found
it
a
heavy
matter
nor
should
i
have
waded
it
but
for
my
guide
for
the
water
bore
against
me
like
a
man
wrestling
and
it
was
as
cold
as
acheron
the
river
of
the
dead
then
on
the
further
shore
and
warning
him
in
lingua
franca
of
his
peril
i
gave
him
his
wage
and
he
smiled
and
thanked
me
and
went
back
choosing
his
plans
at
leisure
thus
did
i
cross
the
river
taro
a
danger
for
men
where
i
landed
was
a
poor
man
sunning
himself
he
rose
and
walked
with
me
to
fornovo
he
knew
the
guide
is
a
good
man
he
said
to
me
of
this
friend
is
as
good
as
a
little
piece
of
bread
vero
i
answered
san
cristophero
this
pleased
the
peasant
and
indeed
it
was
true
for
the
business
was
exactly
that
of
st
christopher
except
that
the
saint
took
no
money
and
lived
i
suppose
on
air
and
so
to
fornovo
and
the
heat
blinded
and
confused
and
the
air
was
alive
with
flies
but
the
sun
dried
me
at
once
and
i
pressed
up
the
road
because
i
needed
food
after
i
had
eaten
in
this
old
town
i
was
preparing
to
make
for
calestano
and
to
cross
the
first
high
spur
of
the
apennines
that
separated
me
from
it
when
i
saw
as
i
left
the
place
a
very
old
church
and
i
stayed
a
moment
and
looked
at
carvings
which
were
in
no
order
but
put
in
evidently
chosen
from
some
older
building
they
were
barbaric
but
one
could
see
that
they
stood
for
the
last
judgement
of
man
and
there
were
the
good
looking
foolish
and
there
were
the
wicked
being
boiled
by
devils
in
a
pot
and
what
was
most
pleasing
was
one
devil
who
with
great
joy
was
carrying
off
a
rich
man
gold
in
a
bag
but
now
we
are
too
wise
to
believe
in
such
follies
and
when
we
die
we
take
our
wealth
with
us
in
the
ninth
century
they
had
no
way
of
doing
this
for
no
system
of
credit
yet
obtained
then
leaving
the
main
road
which
runs
to
pontremoli
and
at
last
to
spezzia
my
lane
climbed
up
into
the
hills
and
ceased
little
by
little
to
be
even
a
lane
it
became
from
time
to
time
the
bed
of
a
stream
then
nothing
then
a
lane
again
and
at
last
at
the
head
of
the
glen
i
confessed
to
having
lost
it
but
i
noted
a
great
rock
or
peak
above
me
for
a
landmark
and
i
said
to
myself
matter
the
wall
of
this
glen
before
me
is
obviously
the
ridge
of
the
spur
the
rock
must
be
left
to
the
north
and
i
have
but
to
cross
the
ridge
by
its
guidance
by
this
time
however
the
heat
overcame
me
and
as
it
was
already
afternoon
and
as
i
had
used
so
much
of
the
preceding
night
for
my
journey
i
remembered
the
wise
custom
of
hot
countries
and
lay
down
to
sleep
i
slept
but
a
little
while
yet
when
i
woke
the
air
was
cooler
i
climbed
the
side
of
the
glen
at
random
and
on
the
summit
i
found
to
my
disgust
a
road
what
road
could
it
be
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
perhaps
i
had
missed
my
way
and
struck
the
main
highway
again
perhaps
it
is
often
so
in
the
apennines
it
was
a
road
leading
nowhere
at
any
rate
i
hesitated
and
looked
back
to
judge
my
direction
it
was
a
happy
accident
i
was
now
some
feet
above
the
taro
there
before
me
stood
the
high
strange
rock
that
i
had
watched
from
below
all
around
it
and
below
me
was
the
glen
or
cup
of
bare
hills
slabs
and
slopes
of
sand
and
stone
calcined
in
the
sun
and
beyond
these
near
things
all
the
plain
of
lombardy
was
at
my
feet
it
was
this
which
made
it
worth
while
to
have
toiled
up
that
steep
wall
and
even
to
have
lost
my
way
to
see
a
hundred
miles
of
the
great
flat
stretched
out
before
me
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
nor
was
this
all
there
were
sharp
white
clouds
on
the
far
northern
horizon
low
down
above
the
uncertain
edge
of
the
world
i
looked
again
and
found
they
did
not
move
then
i
knew
they
were
the
alps
believe
it
or
not
i
was
looking
back
to
a
place
of
days
before
over
how
many
many
miles
of
road
the
rare
white
peaks
and
edges
could
not
deceive
me
they
still
stood
to
the
sunlight
and
sent
me
from
that
vast
distance
the
memory
of
my
passage
when
their
snows
had
seemed
interminable
and
their
height
so
monstrous
their
cold
such
a
cloak
of
death
now
they
were
as
far
off
as
childhood
and
i
saw
them
for
the
last
time
all
this
i
drew
then
finding
a
post
directing
me
to
a
side
road
for
calestano
i
followed
it
down
and
down
into
the
valley
beyond
and
up
the
walls
of
this
second
valley
as
the
evening
fell
i
heard
the
noise
of
the
water
running
as
the
taro
had
run
a
net
of
torrents
from
the
melting
snows
far
off
these
streams
i
soon
saw
below
me
winding
as
those
of
the
taro
had
wound
through
a
floor
of
dry
shingle
and
rock
but
when
my
road
ceased
suddenly
some
hundreds
of
feet
above
the
bed
of
the
river
and
when
full
of
evening
i
had
scrambled
down
through
trees
to
the
brink
of
the
water
i
found
i
should
have
to
repeat
what
i
had
done
that
morning
and
to
ford
these
streams
for
there
was
no
track
of
any
kind
and
no
bridge
and
calestano
stood
opposite
me
a
purple
cluster
of
houses
in
the
dusk
against
the
farther
mountain
side
very
warily
lobbing
stones
as
i
had
been
taught
and
following
up
and
down
each
branch
to
find
a
place
i
forded
one
by
one
the
six
little
cold
and
violent
rivers
and
reaching
the
farther
shore
i
reached
also
as
i
thought
supper
companionship
and
a
bed
but
it
is
not
in
this
simple
way
that
human
life
is
arranged
what
awaited
me
in
calestano
was
ill
favour
a
prison
release
base
flattery
and
a
very
tardy
meal
it
is
our
duty
to
pity
all
men
it
is
our
duty
to
pity
those
who
are
in
prison
it
is
our
duty
to
pity
those
who
are
not
in
prison
how
much
more
is
it
the
duty
of
a
christian
man
to
pity
the
rich
who
can
not
ever
get
into
prison
these
indeed
i
do
now
specially
pity
and
extend
to
them
my
commiseration
what
never
even
to
have
felt
the
grip
of
the
policeman
to
have
watched
his
bold
suspicious
eye
to
have
tried
to
make
a
good
show
under
examination
never
to
have
heard
the
bolt
grinding
in
the
lock
and
never
to
have
looked
round
at
the
cleanly
simplicity
of
a
cell
then
what
emotions
have
you
had
unimprisonable
rich
or
what
do
you
know
of
active
living
and
of
adventure
it
was
after
drinking
some
wine
and
eating
macaroni
and
bread
at
a
poor
inn
the
only
one
in
the
place
and
after
having
to
shout
at
the
hostess
and
to
try
twenty
guesses
before
i
made
her
understand
that
i
wanted
cheese
it
was
when
i
had
thus
eaten
and
shouted
and
had
gone
over
the
way
to
drink
coffee
and
to
smoke
in
a
little
cafe
that
my
adventure
befell
me
in
the
inn
there
had
been
a
fat
man
and
two
people
with
white
caps
dining
at
another
table
i
had
taken
no
notice
of
them
at
the
time
but
as
i
sat
smoking
and
thinking
in
the
little
cafe
which
was
bright
and
full
of
people
i
noticed
a
first
when
i
was
told
sullenly
that
had
no
bed
they
thought
i
could
get
none
in
the
town
then
suddenly
these
two
men
in
white
caps
came
in
and
they
arrested
me
with
as
much
ease
as
you
or
i
would
hold
a
horse
a
moment
later
there
came
in
two
magnificent
fellows
gendarmes
with
swords
and
cocked
hats
and
moustaches
el
kader
as
we
used
to
say
in
the
old
days
these
four
the
two
gendarmes
and
two
policemen
sat
down
opposite
me
on
chairs
and
began
me
in
italian
a
language
in
which
i
was
not
proficient
i
so
far
understood
them
as
to
know
that
they
were
asking
for
my
papers
said
i
and
poured
out
on
the
table
a
a
two
pencils
a
bottle
of
wine
a
cup
a
piece
of
bread
a
scrap
of
french
newspaper
an
old
a
needle
some
thread
and
a
flute
but
no
passport
they
looked
in
the
and
found
lira
that
is
not
quite
three
pounds
they
examined
the
critically
as
behoved
southerners
who
are
mostly
of
an
artistic
bent
but
they
found
no
passport
they
questioned
me
again
and
as
i
picked
about
for
words
to
reply
the
smaller
the
policeman
a
man
with
a
face
like
a
fox
shouted
that
he
had
heard
me
speaking
italian
in
the
inn
and
that
my
hesitation
was
a
blind
this
lie
so
annoyed
me
that
i
said
angrily
in
french
which
i
made
as
southern
as
possible
to
suit
them
lie
and
you
can
be
punished
for
such
lies
since
you
are
an
official
for
though
the
police
are
the
same
in
all
countries
and
will
swear
black
is
white
and
destroy
men
for
a
song
yet
where
there
is
a
that
is
where
the
revolution
has
made
things
tolerable
you
are
much
surer
of
punishing
your
policeman
and
he
is
much
less
able
to
do
you
a
damage
than
in
england
or
america
for
he
counts
as
an
official
and
is
under
a
more
public
discipline
and
responsibility
if
he
exceeds
his
powers
then
i
added
speaking
distinctly
can
speak
french
and
latin
have
you
a
priest
in
calestano
and
does
he
know
latin
this
was
a
fine
touch
they
winced
and
parried
it
by
saying
that
the
sindaco
knew
french
then
they
led
me
away
to
their
barracks
while
they
fetched
the
sindaco
and
so
i
was
imprisoned
but
not
for
long
very
soon
i
was
again
following
up
the
street
and
we
came
to
the
house
of
the
sindaco
or
mayor
there
he
was
an
old
man
with
white
hair
god
bless
him
playing
cards
with
his
son
and
daughter
to
him
therefore
as
understanding
french
i
was
bidden
address
myself
i
told
him
in
clear
and
exact
idiom
that
his
policemen
were
fools
that
his
town
was
a
and
his
prison
the
only
cleanly
thing
in
it
that
telegrams
to
places
i
could
indicate
would
show
where
i
had
passed
that
i
was
a
common
tourist
not
even
an
artist
as
my
showed
and
that
my
cards
gave
my
exact
address
and
description
but
the
sindaco
the
sindaco
understood
me
not
in
the
least
and
it
seemed
a
wicked
thing
in
me
to
expose
him
in
his
old
age
so
i
waited
till
he
spoke
he
spoke
a
word
common
to
all
languages
and
one
he
had
just
caught
from
my
lips
he
said
i
nodded
then
he
told
them
to
let
me
go
it
was
as
simple
as
that
and
to
this
day
i
suppose
he
passes
for
a
very
bilingual
mayor
he
did
me
a
service
and
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
in
his
youth
he
smacked
his
lips
over
the
subtle
flavour
of
voltaire
but
i
fear
he
would
have
a
poor
time
with
anatole
france
what
a
contrast
was
there
between
the
hour
when
i
had
gone
out
of
the
cafe
a
prisoner
and
that
when
i
returned
rejoicing
with
a
crowd
about
me
proclaiming
my
innocence
and
shouting
one
to
another
that
i
was
a
tourist
and
had
lira
on
my
person
the
landlady
smiled
and
bowed
she
had
before
refused
me
a
bed
the
men
at
the
tables
made
me
a
god
nor
did
i
think
them
worse
for
this
why
should
i
a
man
unknown
unkempt
unshaven
in
tatters
covered
with
weeks
of
travel
and
mud
and
in
a
suit
that
originally
cost
not
ten
shillings
having
slept
in
leaves
and
ferns
and
forest
places
crosses
a
river
at
dusk
and
enters
a
town
furtively
not
by
the
road
he
is
a
foreigner
he
carries
a
great
club
is
it
not
much
wiser
to
arrest
such
a
man
why
yes
evidently
and
when
you
have
arrested
him
can
you
do
more
than
let
him
go
without
proof
on
his
own
word
hardly
thus
i
loved
the
people
of
calestano
especially
for
this
strange
adventure
they
had
given
me
and
next
day
having
slept
in
a
human
room
i
went
at
sunrise
up
the
mountain
sides
beyond
and
above
their
town
and
so
climbed
by
a
long
cleft
the
spur
of
the
apennines
the
spur
that
separated
me
from
the
river
the
parma
and
my
goal
above
the
parma
when
i
should
have
crossed
it
was
a
place
marked
in
the
map
to
climb
this
second
spur
to
reach
and
cross
the
parma
in
the
vale
below
to
find
tizzano
i
left
calestano
on
that
fragrant
morning
and
having
passed
and
drawn
a
little
hamlet
called
frangi
standing
on
a
crag
i
went
on
up
the
steep
vale
and
soon
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
which
here
dips
a
little
and
allows
a
path
to
cross
over
to
the
southern
side
it
is
the
custom
of
many
when
they
get
over
a
ridge
to
begin
singing
nor
did
i
fail
early
as
was
the
hour
to
sing
in
passing
this
the
second
of
my
apennine
summits
i
sang
easily
with
an
open
throat
everything
that
i
could
remember
in
praise
of
joy
and
i
did
not
spare
the
choruses
of
my
songs
being
even
at
pains
to
imitate
when
they
were
double
the
various
voices
of
either
part
now
so
much
of
the
englishman
was
in
me
that
coming
round
a
corner
of
rock
from
which
one
first
sees
beduzzo
hanging
on
its
ledge
as
you
know
and
finding
round
this
corner
a
peasant
sitting
at
his
ease
i
was
ashamed
for
i
did
not
like
to
be
overheard
singing
fantastic
songs
but
he
used
to
singing
as
a
solitary
pastime
greeted
me
and
we
walked
along
together
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
glories
of
the
world
before
us
and
exulting
in
the
morning
it
was
his
business
to
show
me
things
and
their
names
the
great
mountain
of
the
pilgrimage
to
the
south
the
strange
rock
of
in
the
far
haze
the
plain
of
parma
and
tizzano
on
its
high
hill
the
ridge
straight
before
me
he
also
would
tell
me
the
name
in
italian
of
the
things
to
hand
my
boots
my
staff
my
hat
and
i
told
him
their
names
in
french
all
of
which
he
was
eager
to
learn
we
talked
of
the
way
people
here
tilled
and
owned
ground
of
the
dangers
in
the
hills
and
of
the
happiness
of
lonely
men
but
if
you
ask
how
we
understood
each
other
i
will
explain
the
matter
to
you
in
italy
in
the
apennines
of
the
north
there
seem
to
be
three
strata
of
language
in
the
valleys
the
italian
was
pure
resonant
and
foreign
to
me
there
dwell
the
townsmen
and
they
deal
down
river
with
the
plains
up
as
at
frangi
at
beduzzo
at
tizzano
i
began
to
understand
them
they
have
the
nasal
they
clip
their
words
on
the
summits
at
last
they
speak
like
northerners
and
i
was
easily
understood
for
they
said
not
not
but
and
so
forth
they
are
the
gauls
of
the
hills
i
told
them
so
and
they
were
very
pleased
then
i
and
my
peasant
parted
but
as
one
should
never
leave
a
man
without
giving
him
something
to
show
by
way
of
token
on
the
day
of
judgement
i
gave
this
man
a
little
picture
of
milan
and
bade
him
keep
it
for
my
sake
so
he
went
his
way
and
i
mine
and
the
last
thing
he
said
to
me
was
about
a
but
i
did
not
know
what
that
meant
when
i
had
taken
a
cut
down
the
mountain
and
discovered
a
highroad
at
the
bottom
i
saw
that
the
river
before
me
needed
fording
like
all
the
rest
and
as
my
map
showed
me
there
was
no
bridge
for
many
miles
down
i
cast
about
to
cross
directly
if
possible
on
some
shoulders
i
met
an
old
woman
with
a
heap
of
grass
on
her
back
i
pointed
to
the
river
and
said
in
lingua
franca
that
i
wished
to
cross
she
again
used
that
word
and
i
had
an
inkling
that
it
meant
i
said
to
myself
there
is
a
miller
there
is
a
mill
for
petrus
ibi
where
there
is
a
mill
there
is
water
a
mill
must
have
motive
power
a
i
must
get
near
the
stream
b
i
must
look
out
for
the
noise
and
aspect
of
a
mill
i
therefore
thanking
the
woman
went
right
over
the
fields
till
i
saw
a
great
slow
against
a
house
and
a
sad
man
standing
looking
at
it
as
though
it
were
the
procession
of
providence
he
was
thinking
of
many
things
i
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
whereat
he
started
and
spoke
the
great
word
of
that
valley
it
opened
all
the
gates
of
his
soul
he
smiled
at
me
like
a
man
grown
young
again
and
beckoning
me
to
follow
led
radiantly
up
the
sluice
to
where
it
drew
from
the
river
here
three
men
were
at
work
digging
a
better
entry
for
the
water
one
was
an
old
happy
man
in
spectacles
the
second
a
young
man
with
stilts
in
his
hands
the
third
was
very
tall
and
narrow
his
face
was
sad
and
he
was
of
the
kind
that
endure
all
things
and
conquer
i
said
i
had
found
him
to
the
man
who
had
brought
me
i
gave
and
so
innocent
and
good
are
these
people
that
he
said
or
words
like
it
and
i
said
it
was
necessary
then
i
said
to
the
molinar
and
he
holding
up
a
tall
finger
said
the
young
man
leapt
on
to
his
stilts
the
molinar
stooped
down
and
i
got
upon
his
shoulders
and
we
all
attempted
the
many
streams
of
the
river
parma
in
which
i
think
i
should
by
myself
have
drowned
i
say
advisedly
should
have
been
drowned
these
upper
rivers
of
the
hills
run
high
and
low
according
to
storms
and
to
the
melting
of
the
snows
the
river
of
parma
for
this
torrent
at
last
fed
parma
was
higher
than
the
rest
even
the
molinar
the
god
of
that
valley
had
to
pick
his
way
carefully
and
the
young
man
on
stilts
had
to
go
before
much
higher
than
mortal
men
and
up
above
the
water
i
could
see
him
as
he
went
and
i
could
see
that
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
a
ford
a
rare
thing
in
upper
waters
because
in
the
of
rivers
either
the
upper
waters
run
over
changeless
rocks
or
else
over
gravel
and
sand
now
if
they
run
over
rocks
they
have
their
isolated
shallow
places
which
any
man
may
find
and
their
deep
evident
by
the
still
and
mysterious
surface
where
fish
go
round
and
round
in
the
hollows
but
no
true
ford
continuous
from
side
to
side
so
it
is
in
scotland
and
if
they
run
over
gravel
and
sand
then
with
every
storm
or
they
shift
and
change
but
here
by
some
accident
there
ran
perhaps
a
shelf
or
rock
perhaps
a
ruin
of
a
roman
bridge
something
at
least
that
was
deep
enough
and
solid
enough
to
be
a
true
ford
and
that
we
followed
the
molinar
even
the
molinar
was
careful
of
his
way
twice
he
waited
waist
high
while
the
man
on
stilts
before
us
suddenly
lost
ground
and
plunged
to
his
feet
once
crossing
a
small
branch
for
the
river
here
like
all
these
rivers
runs
in
many
arms
over
the
dry
gravel
it
seemed
there
was
no
foothold
and
we
had
to
cast
up
and
down
whenever
we
found
dry
land
i
came
off
the
molinar
back
to
rest
him
and
when
he
took
the
water
again
i
mounted
again
so
we
passed
the
many
streams
and
stood
at
last
on
the
tizzanian
side
then
i
gave
a
lira
to
the
molinar
and
to
his
companion
on
stilts
who
said
is
this
for
and
i
said
also
helped
the
molinar
then
with
gesticulations
and
expression
of
the
eyes
gave
me
to
understand
that
for
this
the
would
take
me
up
to
tizzano
on
the
high
ridge
and
show
me
the
path
up
the
ridge
so
the
turned
to
me
and
said
means
when
the
italians
say
are
less
harsh
than
the
northern
french
who
say
the
northern
french
have
three
troubles
in
the
blood
they
are
fighters
they
will
for
ever
be
seeking
the
perfect
state
and
they
love
furiously
hence
they
ferment
twice
over
like
wine
subjected
to
movement
and
breeding
acidity
therefore
is
it
that
when
they
say
it
is
harsher
than
my
italian
said
to
me
genially
the
catholic
church
makes
men
by
which
i
do
not

swaggerers
nor
bullies
nor
ignorant
fools
who
finding
themselves
comfortable
think
that
their
comfort
will
be

to

human

different

capable

accepting

tenacious
of
her
effects
the
most
gracious
is
the
character
of
the
irish
and
of
these
italians
of
such
also
some
day
she
may
make
soldiers
have
you
ever
noticed
that
all
the
catholic
church
does
is
thought
beautiful
and
lovable
until
she
comes
out
into
the
open
and
then
suddenly
she
is
found
by
her
enemies
which
are
the
seven
capital
sins
and
the
four
sins
calling
to
heaven
for
vengeance
to
be
hateful
and
grinding
so
it
is
and
it
is
the
fine
irony
of
her
present
renovation
that
those
who
were
for
ever
belauding
her
pictures
and
her
saints
and
her
architecture
as
we
praise
things
dead
they
are
the
most
angered
by
her
appearance
on
this
modern
field
all
armed
just
as
she
was
with
works
and
art
and
songs
sometimes
superlative
often
vulgar
note
you
she
is
still
careless
of
art
or
songs
as
she
has
always
been
she
lays
her
foundations
in
something
other
which
something
other
our
moderns
hate
yet
out
of
that
something
other
came
the
art
and
song
of
the
middle
ages
and
what
art
or
songs
have
you
she
is
europe
and
all
our
past
she
is
returning
lector
but
mr
deleted
by
the
censor
does
not

so
auctor
i
last
saw
him
supping
at
the
savoy
we
went
up
the
hill
together
over
a
burnt
land
but
shaded
with
trees
it
was
very
hot
i
could
scarcely
continue
so
fast
did
my
companion
go
and
so
much
did
the
heat
oppress
me
we
passed
a
fountain
at
which
oxen
drank
and
there
i
supped
up
cool
water
from
the
spout
but
he
wagged
his
finger
before
his
face
to
tell
me
that
this
was
an
error
under
a
hot
sun
we
went
on
and
met
two
men
driving
cattle
up
the
path
between
the
trees
these
i
soon
found
to
be
talking
of
prices
and
markets
with
my
guide
for
it
was
as
we
came
up
at
last
on
to
the
little
town
a
little
little
town
like
a
nest
and
all
surrounded
with
walls
and
a
castle
in
it
and
a
church
we
found
a
thousand
beasts
all
lowing
and
answering
each
other
along
the
highroad
and
on
into
the
market
square
through
the
gate
there
my
guide
led
me
into
a
large
room
where
a
great
many
peasants
were
eating
soup
with
macaroni
in
it
and
some
few
meat
but
i
was
too
exhausted
to
eat
meat
so
i
supped
up
my
broth
and
then
began
diapephradizing
on
my
fingers
to
show
the
great
innkeeper
what
i
wanted
i
first
pulled
up
the
macaroni
out
of
the
dish
and
said
pommodoro
by
which
i
meant
cheese
tomato
he
then
said
he
knew
what
i
meant
and
brought
me
that
spaghetti
so
treated
which
is
a
dish
for
a
king
a
cosmopolitan
traitor
an
oppressor
of
the
poor
a
usurer
or
any
other
rich
man
but
there
is
no
spaghetti
in
the
place
to
which
such
men
go
whereas
these
peasants
will
continue
to
enjoy
it
in
heaven
i
then
pulled
out
my
bottle
of
wine
drank
what
was
left
out
of
the
neck
by
way
of
sign
and
putting
it
down
said
tantum
vino
rosso
my
guide
also
said
many
things
which
probably
meant
that
i
was
a
rich
man
who
threw
his
money
about
by
the
sixpence
so
the
innkeeper
went
through
a
door
and
brought
back
a
bottle
all
corked
and
sealed
and
said
on
his
fingers
and
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
kind
of
wine
is
something
very
special
only
in
the
foolish
cities
do
men
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
appear
careless
of
money
so
i
very
narrowly
watching
him
out
of
eyes
held
up
my
five
fingers
interrogatively
and
said
meaning
you
ask
fivepence
at
which
he
and
all
the
peasants
around
even
including
my
guide
laughed
aloud
as
at
an
excellent
joke
and
said
ho
ho
and
dug
each
other
in
the
ribs
but
the
innkeeper
of
tizzano
val
parmense
said
in
italian
a
number
of
things
which
meant
that
i
could
but
be
joking
and
added
in
passing
that
a
lira
made
it
a
kind
of
gift
to
me
a
lira
was
as
it
were
but
a
token
to
prove
that
it
had
changed
hands
a
registration
fee
a
matter
of
record
at
a
lira
it
was
pure
charity
then
i
said
dix
which
meant
nothing
to
him
so
i
held
up
seven
fingers
he
waved
his
hand
about
genially
and
said
that
as
i
was
evidently
a
good
fellow
a
traveller
and
as
anyhow
he
was
practically
giving
me
the
wine
he
would
make
it
ninepence
it
was
hardly
worth
his
while
to
stretch
out
his
hand
for
so
little
money
so
then
i
pulled
out
in
coppers
and
said
which
means
then
he
put
the
bottle
before
me
took
the
money
and
an
immense
clamour
rose
from
all
those
who
had
been
watching
the
scene
and
they
applauded
it
as
a
ratified
bargain
and
this
is
the
way
in
which
bargains
were
struck
of
old
time
in
these
hills
when
your
fathers
and
mine
lived
and
shivered
in
a
cave
hunted
wolves
and
bargained
with
clubs
only
so
this
being
settled
and
i
eager
for
the
wine
wished
it
to
be
opened
especially
to
stand
drink
to
my
guide
the
innkeeper
was
in
another
room
the
guide
was
too
courteous
to
ask
for
a
corkscrew
and
i
did
not
know
the
italian
for
a
corkscrew
i
pointed
to
the
cork
but
all
i
got
out
of
my
guide
was
a
remark
that
the
wine
was
very
good
then
i
made
the
emblem
and
sign
of
a
corkscrew
in
my
with
a
pencil
but
he
pretended
not
to
understand
such
was
his
breeding
then
i
imitated
the
mode
sound
and
gesture
of
a
corkscrew
entering
a
cork
and
an
old
man
next
to
me
said
common
french
word
as
familiar
as
the
woods
of
marly
it
was
brought
the
bottle
was
opened
and
we
all
drank
together
as
i
rose
to
go
out
of
tizzano
val
parmense
my
guide
said
to
me
chiama
perche
e
lira
il
and
i
said
to
him
and
left
him
to
his
hills
i
took
the
road
downwards
from
the
ridge
into
the
next
dip
and
valley
but
after
a
mile
or
so
in
the
great
heat
it
was
now
one
i
was
exhausted
so
i
went
up
to
a
little
wooded
bank
and
lay
there
in
the
shade
sketching
tizzano
val
parmense
where
it
stood
not
much
above
me
and
then
i
lay
down
and
slept
for
an
hour
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
thought
of
many
things
from
the
ridge
on
which
tizzano
stands
which
is
the
third
of
these
apennine
spurs
to
the
next
the
fourth
is
but
a
little
way
one
looks
across
from
one
to
the
other
nevertheless
it
is
a
difficult
piece
of
walking
because
in
the
middle
of
the
valley
another
ridge
almost
as
high
as
the
principal
spurs
runs
down
and
this
has
to
be
climbed
at
its
lowest
part
before
one
can
get
down
to
the
torrent
of
the
enza
where
it
runs
with
a
hollow
noise
in
the
depths
of
the
mountains
so
the
whole
valley
looks
confused
and
it
appears
and
is
laborious
very
high
up
above
in
a
mass
of
trees
stood
the
first
of
those
many
ruined
towers
and
castles
in
which
the
apennines
abound
and
of
which
canossa
far
off
and
indistinguishable
in
the
haze
was
the
chief
example
it
was
called
tower
of
rugino
beyond
the
deep
trench
of
the
enza
poised
as
it
seemed
on
its
southern
bank
but
really
much
further
off
in
the
secchia
valley
stood
that
strange
high
rock
of
which
the
peasant
had
shown
me
that
morning
and
which
was
the
landmark
of
this
attempt
it
seemed
made
rather
by
man
than
by
nature
so
square
and
exact
was
it
and
so
cut
off
from
the
other
hills
it
was
not
till
the
later
afternoon
when
the
air
was
already
full
of
the
golden
dust
that
comes
before
the
fall
of
the
evening
that
i
stood
above
the
enza
and
saw
it
running
thousands
of
feet
below
here
i
halted
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
looked
at
the
confusion
of
the
hills
it
had
been
my
intention
to
make
a
straight
line
for
collagna
but
i
could
not
tell
where
collagna
lay
save
that
it
was
somewhere
behind
the
high
mountain
that
was
now
darkening
against
the
sky
moreover
the
enza
as
i
could
see
down
down
from
where
i
stood
was
not
fordable
it
did
not
run
in
streams
but
in
one
full
current
and
was
a
true
river
all
the
scene
was
wild
i
had
come
close
to
the
central
ridge
of
the
apennines
it
stood
above
me
but
five
or
six
clear
miles
away
and
on
its
slopes
there
were
patches
and
fields
of
snow
which
were
beginning
to
glimmer
in
the
diminishing
light
four
peasants
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
road
they
were
preparing
to
go
to
their
quiet
homesteads
and
they
were
gathering
their
scythes
together
for
they
had
been
mowing
in
a
field
coming
up
to
these
i
asked
them
how
i
might
reach
collagna
they
told
me
that
i
could
not
go
straight
as
i
had
wished
on
account
of
the
impassable
river
but
that
if
i
went
down
the
steep
directly
below
me
i
should
find
a
bridge
that
thence
a
path
went
up
the
opposite
ridge
to
where
a
hamlet
called
ceregio
which
they
showed
me
beyond
the
valley
stood
in
trees
on
the
crest
and
once
there
they
said
i
could
be
further
directed
i
understood
all
their
speech
except
one
fatal
word
i
thought
they
told
me
that
ceregio
was
the
way
to
collagna
and
what
that
error
cost
me
you
shall
hear
they
drank
my
wine
i
ate
their
bread
and
we
parted
they
to
go
to
their
accustomed
place
and
i
to
cross
this
unknown
valley
but
when
i
had
left
these
grave
and
kindly
men
the
echo
of
their
voices
remained
with
me
the
deep
valley
of
the
enza
seemed
lonely
and
as
i
went
lower
and
lower
down
towards
the
noise
of
the
river
i
lost
the
sun
the
enza
was
flooded
a
rough
bridge
made
of
stout
logs
resting
on
trunks
of
trees
that
were
lashed
together
like
tripods
and
supported
a
long
plank
was
afforded
to
cross
it
but
in
the
high
water
it
did
not
quite
reach
to
the
hither
bank
i
rolled
great
stones
into
the
water
and
made
a
short
causeway
and
so
somewhat
perilously
i
attained
the
farther
shore
and
went
up
up
by
a
little
precipitous
path
till
i
reached
the
hamlet
of
ceregio
standing
on
its
hill
blessed
and
secluded
for
no
road
leads
in
or
out
of
it
but
only
the
houses
were
all
grouped
together
round
a
church
it
was
dim
between
them
but
several
men
driving
oxen
took
me
to
a
house
that
was
perhaps
the
inn
though
there
was
no
sign
and
there
in
a
twilight
room
we
all
sat
down
together
like
christians
in
perfect
harmony
and
the
woman
of
the
house
served
us
now
when
after
this
communion
i
asked
the
way
to
collagna
they
must
have
thought
me
foolish
and
have
wondered
why
i
did
not
pass
the
night
with
them
for
they
knew
how
far
off
collagna
was
but
i
by
the
error
in
language
of
which
i
have
told
you
believed
it
to
be
but
a
short
way
off
it
was
in
reality
ten
miles
the
oldest
of
my
companions
said
he
would
put
me
on
the
way
we
went
together
in
the
half
light
by
a
lane
that
followed
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
we
passed
a
charming
thing
a
little
white
sculpture
in
relief
set
up
for
a
shrine
and
representing
the
annunciation
and
as
we
passed
it
we
both
smiled
then
in
a
few
hundred
yards
we
passed
another
that
was
the
visitation
and
they
were
gracious
and
beautiful
to
a
degree
and
i
saw
that
they
stood
for
the
five
joyful
mysteries
then
he
had
to
leave
me
and
he
said
pointing
to
the
little
shrine
you
come
to
the
fifth
of
these
the
path
divides
take
that
to
the
left
and
follow
it
round
the
hollow
of
the
mountain
it
will
become
a
lane
this
lane
crosses
a
stream
and
passes
near
a
tower
when
you
have
reached
the
tower
it
joins
a
great
highroad
and
that
is
the
road
to
collagna
and
when
he
indicated
the
shrines
he
smiled
as
though
in
apology
for
them
and
i
saw
that
we
were
of
the
same
religion
then
since
people
who
will
not
meet
again
should
give
each
other
presents
mutually
i
gave
him
the
best
of
my
two
pipes
a
new
pipe
with
letters
carved
on
it
which
he
took
to
be
the
initials
of
my
name
and
he
on
his
part
gave
me
a
which
he
had
plucked
and
had
been
holding
in
his
fingers
and
i
continued
the
path
alone
certainly
these
people
have
a
benediction
upon
them
granted
them
for
their
simple
lives
and
their
justice
their
eyes
are
fearless
and
kindly
they
are
courteous
straight
and
all
have
in
them
laughter
and
sadness
they
are
full
of
songs
of
memories
of
the
stories
of
their
native
place
and
their
worship
is
conformable
to
the
world
that
god
made
may
they
possess
their
own
land
and
may
their
influence
come
again
from
italy
to
save
from
jar
and
boasting
and
ineptitude
the
foolish
valourless
cities
and
the
garish
crowds
of
shouting
men
and
let
us
especially
pray
that
the
revival
of
the
faith
may
do
something
for
our
poor
old
universities
already
when
i
heard
all
these
directions
they
seemed
to
argue
a
longer
road
than
i
had
expected
it
proved
interminable
it
was
now
fully
dark
the
night
was
very
cold
from
the
height
of
the
hills
a
dense
dew
began
to
fall
upon
the
ground
and
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
for
hours
i
went
on
slowly
down
the
lane
that
ran
round
the
hollow
of
the
wooded
mountain
wondering
why
i
did
not
reach
the
stream
he
spoke
of
it
was
midnight
when
i
came
to
the
level
and
yet
i
heard
no
water
and
did
not
yet
see
the
tower
against
the
sky
extreme
fatigue
made
it
impossible
as
i
thought
to
proceed
farther
when
i
saw
a
light
in
a
window
and
went
to
it
quickly
and
stood
beneath
it
a
woman
from
the
window
called
me
mio
which
was
gracious
but
she
would
not
let
me
sleep
even
in
the
straw
of
the
barn
i
hobbled
on
in
despair
of
the
night
for
the
necessity
of
sleep
was
weighing
me
down
after
four
high
hills
climbed
that
day
and
after
the
rough
ways
and
the
heat
and
the
continual
marching
i
found
a
bridge
which
crossed
the
deep
ravine
they
had
told
me
of
this
high
bridge
was
new
and
had
been
built
of
fine
stone
yet
it
was
broken
and
ruined
and
a
gap
suddenly
showed
in
the
dark
i
stepped
back
from
it
in
fear
the
clambering
down
to
the
stream
and
up
again
through
the
briars
to
regain
the
road
broke
me
yet
more
and
when
on
the
hill
beyond
i
saw
the
tower
faintly
darker
against
the
dark
sky
i
went
up
doggedly
to
it
fearing
faintness
and
reaching
it
where
it
stood
it
was
on
the
highest
ground
overlooking
the
secchia
valley
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
beside
it
and
waited
for
the
morning
the
long
slope
of
the
hills
fell
away
for
miles
to
where
by
daylight
would
have
lain
the
misty
plain
of
emilia
the
darkness
confused
the
landscape
the
silence
of
the
mountains
and
the
awful
solemnity
of
the
place
lent
that
vast
panorama
a
sense
of
the
terrible
under
the
dizzy
roof
of
the
stars
every
now
and
again
some
animal
of
the
night
gave
a
cry
in
the
undergrowth
of
the
valley
and
the
great
rock
of
now
close
and
enormous
bare
rugged
a
desert
place
added
something
of
doom
the
hours
were
creeping
on
with
the
less
certain
stars
a
very
faint
and
unliving
grey
touched
the
edges
of
the
clouds
the
cold
possessed
me
and
i
rose
to
walk
if
i
could
walk
a
little
farther
what
is
that
in
the
mind
which
after
it
may
be
a
slight
disappointment
or
a
petty
accident
causes
it
to
suffer
on
the
scale
of
grave
things
i
have
waited
for
the
dawn
a
hundred
times
attended
by
that
mournful
colourless
spirit
which
haunts
the
last
hours
of
darkness
and
influenced
especially
by
the
great
timeless
apathy
that
hangs
round
the
first
uncertain
promise
of
increasing
light
for
there
is
an
hour
before
daylight
when
men
die
and
when
there
is
nothing
above
the
soul
or
around
it
when
even
the
stars
fail
and
this
long
and
dreadful
expectation
i
had
thought
to
be
worst
when
one
was
alone
at
sea
in
a
small
boat
without
wind
drifting
beyond
one
harbour
in
the
ebb
of
the
outer
channel
tide
and
sogging
back
at
the
first
flow
on
the
broad
confused
movement
of
a
sea
without
any
waves
in
such
lonely
mornings
i
have
watched
the
owers
light
turning
and
i
have
counted
up
my
gulf
of
time
and
wondered
that
moments
could
be
so
stretched
out
in
the
clueless
mind
i
have
prayed
for
the
morning
or
for
a
little
draught
of
wind
and
this
i
have
thought
i
say
the
extreme
of
absorption
into
emptiness
and
longing
but
now
on
this
ridge
dragging
myself
on
to
the
main
road
i
found
a
deeper
abyss
of
isolation
and
despairing
fatigue
than
i
had
ever
known
and
i
came
near
to
turning
eastward
and
imploring
the
hastening
of
light
as
men
pray
continually
without
reason
for
things
that
can
but
come
in
a
due
order
i
still
went
forward
a
little
because
when
i
sat
down
my
loneliness
oppressed
me
like
a
misfortune
and
because
my
feet
going
painfully
and
slowly
yet
gave
a
little
balance
and
rhythm
to
the
movement
of
my
mind
i
heard
no
sound
of
animals
or
birds
i
passed
several
fields
deserted
in
the
and
in
some
i
felt
the
hay
but
always
found
it
wringing
wet
with
dew
nor
could
i
discover
a
good
shelter
from
the
wind
that
blew
off
the
upper
snow
of
the
summits
for
a
little
space
of
time
there
fell
upon
me
as
i
crept
along
the
road
that
shadow
of
sleep
which
numbs
the
mind
but
it
could
not
compel
me
to
lie
down
and
i
accepted
it
only
as
a
partial
and
beneficent
oblivion
which
covered
my
desolation
and
suffering
as
a
thin
transparent
cloud
may
cover
an
evil
moon
then
suddenly
the
sky
grew
lighter
upon
every
side
that
cheating
gloom
which
i
think
the
clouds
in
purgatory
must
reflect
lifted
from
the
valley
as
though
to
a
slow
order
given
by
some
calm
and
good
influence
that
was
marshalling
in
the
day
their
colours
came
back
to
things
the
trees
recovered
their
shape
life
and
trembling
here
and
there
on
the
face
of
the
mountain
opposite
the
mists
by
their
movement
took
part
in
the
new
life
and
i
thought
i
heard
for
the
first
time
the
tumbling
water
far
below
me
in
the
ravine
that
subtle
barrier
was
drawn
which
marks
from
yesterday
all
the
night
and
its
despondency
became
the
past
and
entered
memory
the
road
before
me
the
pass
on
my
left
my
last
ridge
and
the
entry
into
tuscany
the
mass
of
the
great
hills
had
become
mixed
into
the
increasing
light
that
is
into
the
familiar
and
invigorating
present
which
i
have
always
found
capable
of
opening
the
doors
of
the
future
with
a
gesture
of
victory
my
pain
either
left
me
or
i
ceased
to
notice
it
and
seeing
a
little
way
before
me
a
bank
above
the
road
and
a
fine
grove
of
sparse
and
dominant
chestnuts
i
climbed
up
thither
and
turned
standing
to
the
east
there
without
any
warning
of
colours
or
of
the
heraldry
that
we
have
in
the
north
the
sky
was
a
great
field
of
pure
light
and
without
doubt
it
was
all
woven
through
as
was
my
mind
watching
it
with
security
and
gladness
into
this
field
as
i
watched
it
rose
the
sun
the
air
became
warmer
almost
suddenly
the
splendour
and
health
of
the
new
day
left
me
all
in
repose
and
persuaded
or
compelled
me
to
immediate
sleep
i
found
therefore
in
the
short
grass
and
on
the
scented
earth
beneath
one
of
my
trees
a
place
for
lying
down
i
stretched
myself
out
upon
it
and
lapsed
into
a
profound
slumber
which
nothing
but
a
vague
and
tenuous
delight
separated
from
complete
forgetfulness
if
the
last
confusion
of
thought
before
sleep
possessed
me
was
a
kind
of
prayer
and
certainly
i
was
in
the
mood
of
gratitude
and
of
adoration
this
prayer
was
of
course
to
god
from
whom
every
good
proceeds
but
partly
idolatrously
to
the
sun
which
of
all
the
things
he
has
made
seems
of
what
we
at
least
can
discover
the
most
complete
and
glorious
therefore
the
first
hours
of
the
sunlight
after
i
had
wakened
made
the
place
like
a
new
country
for
my
mind
which
received
it
was
new
i
reached
collagna
before
the
great
heat
following
the
fine
highroad
that
went
dipping
and
rising
again
along
the
mountain
side
and
then
leaving
the
road
and
crossing
the
little
secchia
by
a
bridge
a
path
soon
lost
in
a
grassy
slope
gave
me
an
indication
of
my
way
for
when
i
had
gone
an
hour
or
so
upwards
along
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
there
opened
gradually
before
me
a
silent
and
profound
vale
hung
with
enormous
woods
and
sloping
upwards
to
where
it
was
closed
by
a
high
bank
beneath
and
between
two
peaks
this
bank
i
knew
could
be
nothing
else
than
the
central
ridge
of
the
apennines
the
watershed
the
boundary
of
tuscany
and
the
end
of
all
the
main
part
of
my
journey
beyond
the
valleys
would
open
on
to
the
tuscan
plain
and
at
the
southern
limit
of
that
siena
was
my
mark
from
siena
to
rome
an
eager
man
if
he
is
sound
may
march
in
three
long
days
nor
was
that
calculation
all
the
satisfaction
of
the
last
lap
of
the
home
run
went
with
the
word
tuscany
in
my
mind
these
cities
were
the
approaches
and
introduction
of
the
end
when
i
had
slept
out
the
heat
i
followed
the
woods
upward
through
the
afternoon
they
stood
tangled
and
huge
and
the
mosses
under
them
were
thick
and
silent
because
in
this
last
belt
of
the
mountains
height
and
coolness
reproduced
the
north
a
charcoal
burner
was
making
his
furnace
after
that
for
the
last
miles
there
was
no
sound
even
the
floor
of
the
vale
was
a
depth
of
grass
and
no
torrent
ran
in
it
but
only
a
little
hidden
stream
leafy
like
our
streams
at
home
at
last
the
steep
bank
a
wall
at
the
end
of
the
valley
rose
immediately
above
me
it
was
very
steep
and
bare
desolate
with
the
many
stumps
of
trees
that
had
been
cut
down
but
all
its
edge
and
fringe
against
the
sky
was
the
line
of
a
deep
forest
after
its
laborious
hundreds
of
feet
when
the
forest
that
crowned
it
evenly
was
reached
the
apennines
were
conquered
the
last
great
range
was
passed
and
there
stood
no
barrier
between
this
high
crest
and
rome
the
hither
side
of
that
bank
i
say
had
been
denuded
of
its
trees
the
roots
of
secular
chestnuts
stood
like
graves
above
the
dry
steep
and
had
marked
my
last
arduous
climb
now
at
the
summit
the
highest
part
was
a
line
of
cool
forest
and
the
late
afternoon
mingled
with
the
sanctity
of
trees
a
genial
dampness
pervaded
the
earth
beneath
grasses
grew
and
there
were
living
creatures
in
the
shade
nor
was
this
tenanted
wood
all
the
welcome
i
received
on
my
entry
into
tuscany
already
i
heard
the
noise
of
falling
waters
upon
every
side
where
the
serchio
sprang
from
twenty
sources
on
the
southern
slope
and
leapt
down
between
mosses
and
quarrelled
and
overcame
great
smooth
dark
rocks
in
busy
falls
indeed
it
was
like
my
own
country
in
the
north
and
a
man
might
say
to
himself
so
much
journeying
perhaps
i
am
in
the
enchanted
wood
and
may
find
at
last
the
fairy
melisaunde
a
glade
opened
and
the
trees
no
longer
hiding
it
i
looked
down
the
vale
which
was
the
gate
of
tuscany
there
high
jagged
rapt
into
the
sky
stood
such
a
group
of
mountains
as
men
dream
of
in
good
dreams
or
see
in
the
works
of
painters
when
old
age
permits
them
revelations
their
height
was
evident
from
the
faint
mist
and
grey
of
their
hues
their
outline
was
tumultuous
yet
balanced
full
of
accident
and
poise
it
was
as
though
these
high
walls
of
carrara
the
western
boundary
of
the
valley
had
been
shaped
expressly
for
man
in
order
to
exalt
him
with
unexpected
and
fantastic
shapes
and
to
expand
his
dull
life
with
a
permanent
surprise
for
a
long
time
i
gazed
at
these
great
hills
then
more
silent
in
the
mind
through
their
influence
i
went
down
past
the
speech
and
companionship
of
the
springs
of
the
serchio
and
the
chestnut
trees
were
redolent
of
evening
all
round
down
the
bank
to
where
the
streams
met
in
one
down
the
river
across
its
gaping
ruinous
bridge
which
some
one
generations
ago
had
built
for
the
rare
travellers
there
were
then
no
main
roads
across
the
apennine
and
perhaps
this
rude
pass
was
in
favour
down
still
more
gently
through
the
narrow
upper
valley
i
went
between
the
chestnut
trees
and
calm
went
with
me
for
a
companion
and
the
love
of
men
and
the
expectation
of
good
seemed
natural
to
all
that
had
been
made
in
this
blessed
place
of
borda
where
the
peasants
directed
me
there
is
no
need
to
speak
till
crossing
the
serchio
once
more
this
time
on
a
trestle
bridge
of
wood
i
passed
by
a
wider
path
through
the
groves
and
entered
the
dear
village
of
sillano
which
looks
right
into
the
pure
west
and
the
peaks
are
guardians
all
about
it
the
elder
brothers
of
this
remote
and
secluded
valley
an
inn
received
me
a
great
kitchen
full
of
men
and
women
talking
a
supper
preparing
a
great
fire
meat
smoking
and
drying
in
the
a
vast
timbered
roof
going
up
into
darkness
there
i
was
courteously
received
but
no
one
understood
my
language
seeing
there
a
young
priest
i
said
to
him
habeo
linguam
latinam
sed
non
habeo
linguam
italicam
visne
mi
dare
traductionem
in
istam
linguam
toscanam
non
nullorum
verborum
to
this
he
replied
and
the
people
revered
us
both
thus
he
told
me
the
name
for
a
knife
was
for
a
room
par
domire
for
is
it
called
si
chiama
for
is
the
road
to
e
la
via
a
and
other
phrases
wherein
no
doubt
i
am
wrong
but
i
only
learnt
by
ear
then
he
said
to
me
something
i
did
not
understand
and
i
answered
at
which
he
seemed
pleased
enough
then
to
make
conversation
i
said
es
and
he
answered
me
mildly
and
gravely
sum
and
a
little
while
after
he
left
for
his
house
but
i
went
out
on
to
the
balcony
where
men
and
women
were
talking
in
subdued
tones
there
alone
i
sat
and
watched
the
night
coming
up
into
these
tuscan
hills
the
first
moon
since
that
waning
in
lorraine
how
many
nights
ago
how
many
marches
hung
in
the
sky
a
full
crescent
growing
into
brightness
and
glory
as
she
assumed
her
reign
the
one
star
of
the
west
called
out
his
silent
companions
in
their
order
the
mountains
merged
into
a
fainter
confusion
heaven
and
the
infinite
air
became
the
natural
seat
of
any
spirit
that
watched
this
spell
the
darted
in
the
depths
of
vineyards
and
of
trees
below
then
the
noise
of
the
grasshoppers
brought
back
suddenly
the
gardens
of
home
and
whatever
benediction
surrounds
our
childhood
some
promise
of
eternal
pleasures
and
of
rest
deserved
haunted
the
village
of
sillano
in
very
early
youth
the
soul
can
still
remember
its
immortal
habitation
and
clouds
and
the
edges
of
hills
are
of
another
kind
from
ours
and
every
scent
and
colour
has
a
savour
of
paradise
what
that
quality
may
be
no
language
can
tell
nor
have
men
made
any
words
no
nor
any
music
to
recall
it
only
in
a
transient
way
and
elusive
the
recollection
of
what
youth
was
and
purity
flashes
on
us
in
phrases
of
the
poets
and
is
gone
before
we
can
fix
it
in
our
minds
oh
my
friends
if
we
could
but
recall
it
whatever
those
sounds
may
be
that
are
beyond
our
sounds
and
whatever
are
those
keen
lives
which
remain
alive
there
under
memory
whatever
is
youth
youth
came
up
that
valley
at
evening
borne
upon
a
southern
air
if
we
deserve
or
attain
beatitude
such
things
shall
at
last
be
our
settled
state
and
their
now
sudden
influence
upon
the
soul
in
short
ecstasies
is
the
proof
that
they
stand
outside
time
and
are
not
subject
to
decay
this
then
was
the
blessing
of
sillano
and
here
was
perhaps
the
highest
moment
of
those
seven
hundred
miles
or
more
do
not
therefore
be
astonished
reader
if
i
now
press
on
much
more
hurriedly
to
rome
for
the
goal
is
almost
between
my
hands
and
the
chief
moment
has
been
enjoyed
until
i
shall
see
the
city
now
i
cry
out
and
deplore
me
that
this
next
sixty
miles
of
way
but
especially
the
heat
of
the
days
and
the
dank
mists
of
the
night
should
have
to
be
told
as
of
a
real
journey
in
this
very
repetitive
and
world
how
much
rather
i
wish
that
being
free
from
mundane
and
that
is
to
say
from
perilously
dusty
considerations
and
droughty
boredoms
i
might
wander
forth
at
leisure
through
the
air
and
visit
the
regions
where
everything
is
as
the
soul
chooses
to
be
dropped
at
last
in
the
ancient
and
famous
town
of
siena
whence
comes
that
kind
of
common
brown
paint
wherewith
men
however
wicked
can
produce
if
they
have
but
the
art
very
surprising
effects
of
depth
in
painting
for
so
i
read
of
it
in
a
book
by
a
fool
at
six
shillings
and
even
that
was
part
of
a
series
but
if
you
wish
to
know
anything
further
of
the
matter
go
you
and
read
it
for
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
oh
to
be
free
for
strange
voyages
even
for
a
little
while
i
am
tired
of
the
road
and
so
are
you
and
small
blame
to
you
your
fathers
also
tired
of
the
treadmill
and
mine
of
the
conquering
marches
of
the
republic
heaven
bless
you
all
but
i
say
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
incredulity
and
doubt
and
hesitation
and
very
cumbersome
air
of
which
is
the
bane
of
our
moderns
very
certainly
i
should
now
go
on
to
tell
of
giants
as
big
as
cedars
living
in
mountains
of
precious
stones
and
drawn
to
battle
by
dragons
in
cars
of
gold
or
of
towns
where
the
customs
of
men
were
remote
and
unexpected
of
countries
not
yet
visited
and
of
the
gods
returning
for
though
it
is
permissible
and
a
pleasant
thing
as
bacon
says
to
mix
a
little
falsehood
with
one
truth
so
st
louis
mixed
water
with
his
wine
and
so
does
sir
john
growl
mix
vinegar
with
his
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
for
if
not
how
does
he
give
it
that
taste
at
his
dinners
eh
there
i
think
is
a
question
that
would
puzzle
him
yet
is
it
much
more
delectable
and
far
worthier
of
the
immortal
spirit
of
man
to
soar
into
the
empyrean
of
pure
lying
that
is
to
lay
the
bridle
on
the
neck
of
pegasus
and
let
him
go
forward
while
in
the
saddle
meanwhile
one
sits
well
back
grips
with
the
knee
takes
the
race
and
on
the
energy
of
that
steed
visits
the
wheeling
stars
this
much
then
is
worth
telling
of
the
valley
of
the
serchio
that
it
is
narrow
garrulous
with
water
brawling
wooded
densely
and
contained
by
fantastic
mountains
that
it
has
a
splendid
name
like
the
clashing
of
cymbals
garfagnana
that
it
leads
to
the
tuscan
plain
and
that
it
is
over
a
day
march
long
also
it
is
an
oven
never
since
the
early
liars
first
cooked
eggs
in
the
sand
was
there
such
heat
and
it
was
made
hotter
by
the
consciousness
of
folly
than
which
there
is
no
more
heating
thing
for
i
think
that
not
old
championnet
himself
with
his
division
of
iron
that
fought
one
to
three
and
crushed
the
aged
enormities
of
the
oppressors
as
we
would
crush
an
empty
egg
and
that
found
the
summer
a
good
time
for
fighting
in
naples
i
say
that
he
himself
would
not
have
marched
men
up
the
garfagnana
in
such
a
sun
folly
planned
it
pride
held
to
it
and
the
devils
lent
their
climate
garfagnana
garfagnana
to
have
such
a
pleasant
name
and
to
be
what
you
are
not
that
there
were
not
old
towers
on
the
steep
woods
of
the
apennine
nor
glimpses
of
the
higher
peaks
towns
also
one
castle
surrounded
by
a
fringe
of
humble
roofs
there
were
all
these
things
but
it
was
an
oven
so
imagine
me
after
having
passed
chapels
built
into
rocks
and
things
most
curious
but
the
whole
under
the
strain
of
an
intolerable
sun
coming
something
after
midday
to
a
place
called
the
first
town
for
campogiamo
is
hardly
a
town
at
i
sat
upon
a
bridge
and
thought
not
what
good
men
think
there
came
into
my
memory
no
historical
stuff
for
all
i
know
liberty
never
went
by
that
valley
in
arms
no
appreciation
of
beauty
filled
me
i
was
indifferent
to
all
save
the
intolerable
heat
when
i
suddenly
recognized
the
enormous
number
of
bridges
that
bespattered
the
town
is
an
odd
thing
i
mused
is
a
little
worriment
of
a
town
up
in
the
hills
and
what
a
powerful
lot
of
bridges
i
cared
not
a
fig
for
the
thousand
things
i
had
been
told
to
expect
in
tuscany
everything
is
in
a
mind
and
as
they
were
not
in
my
mind
they
did
not
exist
but
the
bridges
they
indeed
were
worthy
of
admiration
here
was
a
horrible
little
place
on
a
torrent
bank
one
bridge
was
reasonable
for
by
it
went
the
road
leading
south
to
lucca
and
to
rome
it
was
common
honour
to
let
men
escape
but
as
i
sat
on
that
main
bridge
i
counted
seven
others
indeed
there
must
have
been
a
worship
of
a
some
time
or
other
to
account
for
such
a
necklace
of
bridges
in
such
a
neglected
borough
you
may
say
i
am
off
hard
on
the
road
to
borgo
drooping
with
the
heat
but
still
going
strongly
you
may
say
that
is
explicable
enough
first
a
thing
is
useful
you
say
then
it
has
to
become
routine
then
the
habit
being
a
habit
gets
a
sacred
idea
attached
to
it
so
with
bridges
pontifex
dervorguilla
our

that
built
a

the

that

you
may

all
this
i
shall
not
reply
if
the
heat
has
hindered
me
from
saying
a
word
of
the
fine
open
valley
on
the
left
of
the
little
railway
and
of
the
last
of
the
hills
do
you
suppose
it
will
permit
me
to
discuss
the
sanctity
of
bridges
if
it
did
i
think
there
is
a
little
question
on
should
habit
turn
sacred
which
would
somewhat
confound
and
pose
you
and
pose
also
for
that
matter
every
pedant
that
ever
went
blind
and
over
books
or
took
ivory
for
horn
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
argue
it
with
whom
you
will
it
is
evening
and
i
am
at
borgo
for
if
many
towns
are
called
so
are
many
called
borgo
in
italy
and
i
desire
to
be
free
of
interruption
while
i
eat
and
sleep
and
reflect
upon
the
error
of
that
march
in
that
heat
spoiling
nearly
thirty
miles
of
road
losing
so
many
great
and
pleasurable
emotions
all
for
haste
and
from
a
neglect
of
the
italian
night
and
as
i
ate
and
before
i
slept
i
thought
of
that
annotated
guide
book
which
is
cried
out
for
by
all
europe
and
which
shall
tell
blunt
truths
look
you
out
district
of
valley
of
in
the
index
you
will
be
referred
to
turn
to
you
will
find
there
the
phrase
can
walk
from
the
pretty
little
village
of
sillano
nestling
in
its
chestnut
groves
to
the
flourishing
town
of
borgo
on
the
new
bagni
railway
in
a
day
you
will
find
a
mark
after
that
phrase
it
refers
to
a
footnote
glance
or
look
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
you
will
find
but
if
one
does
one
is
a
fool
so
i
slept
late
and
uneasily
the
insufficient
sleep
of
men
who
have
suffered
and
in
that
uneasy
sleep
i
discovered
this
great
truth
that
if
in
a
southern
summer
you
do
not
rest
in
the
day
the
night
will
seem
intolerably
warm
but
that
if
you
rest
in
the
day
you
will
find
coolness
and
energy
at
evening
the
next
morning
with
daylight
i
continued
the
road
to
lucca
and
of
that
also
i
will
say
nothing
lector
why
on
earth
did
you
write
this
book
auctor
for
my
amusement
lector
and
why
do
you
suppose
i
got
it
auctor
i
can
not
conceive
however
i
will
give
up
this
much
to
tell
you
that
at
decimo
the
mystery
of
cypress
trees
first
came
into
my
adventure
and
pilgrimage
of
cypress
trees
which
henceforward
were
to
mark
my
tuscan
road
and
i
will
tell
you
that
there
also
i
came
across
a
thing
peculiar
i
suppose
to
the
region
of
lucca
for
i
saw
it
there
as
at
decimo
and
also
some
miles
beyond
i
mean
fine
mournful
towers
built
thus
in
the
first
storey
one
arch
in
the
second
two
in
the
third
three
and
so
on
a
very
noble
way
of
building
and
i
will
tell
you
something
more
i
will
tell
you
something
no
one
has
yet
heard
to
wit
why
this
place
is
called
decimo
and
why
just
below
it
is
another
little
spot
called
sexta
lector
auctor
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
do
not
say
it
you
are
going
to
say
is
because
they
were
at
the
sixth
and
tenth
milestones
from
lucca
on
the
roman
road
heaven
help
these
scientists
did
you
suppose
that
i
thought
it
was
called
decimo
because
the
people
had
ten
toes
tell
me
why
is
not
every
place
ten
miles
out
of
a
roman
town
called
by
such
a
name
eh
you
are
dumb
you
can
not
answer
like
most
moderns
you
have
entirely
missed
the
point
we
all
know
that
there
was
a
roman
town
at
lucca
because
it
was
called
luca
and
if
there
had
been
no
roman
town
the
modern
town
would
not
be
spelt
with
two
all
roman
towns
had
milestones
beyond
them
but
why
did
tenth
milestone
from
roman
town
keep
its
name
lector
i
am
indifferent
auctor
i
will
tell
you
up
in
the
tangle
of
the
carrara
mountains
overhanging
the
garfagnana
was
a
wild
tribe
whose
name
i
forget
unless
it
were
the
bruttii
but
which
troubled
the
romans
not
a
little
defeating
them
horribly
and
keeping
the
legionaries
in
some
anxiety
for
years
so
when
the
soldiers
marched
out
north
from
luca
about
six
miles
they
could
halt
and
smile
at
each
other
and
say
that
all
right
all
safe
so
far
and
therefore
only
a
little
village
grew
up
at
this
little
rest
and
emotion
but
as
they
got
nearer
the
gates
of
the
hills
they
began
to
be
visibly
perturbed
and
they
would
say
eighth
mile
cheer
up
then
ninth
mile
sanctissima
madonna
have
you
seen
anything
moving
on
the
heights
but
when
they
got
to
the
milestone
which
stands
before
the
very
jaws
of
the
defile
then
indeed
they
said
with
terrible
emphasis
decimam
and
there
was
no
restraining
them
they
would
camp
and
entrench
or
die
in
the
venture
for
they
were
romans
and
stern
fellows
and
loved
a
good
square
camp
and
a
ditch
and
sentries
and
a
clear
moon
and
plenty
of
sharp
stakes
and
all
the
panoply
of
war
that
is
the
origin
of
decimo
for
all
my
early
start
the
intolerable
heat
had
again
taken
the
ascendant
before
i
had
fairly
entered
the
plain
then
it
being
yet
but
morning
i
entered
from
the
north
the
town
of
lucca
which
is
the
neatest
the
regularest
the
exactest
the
most
little
town
in
the
world
with
its
uncrowded
streets
its
absurd
fortifications
and
its
contented
silent
houses
all
like
a
family
at
ease
and
at
rest
under
its
high
sun
it
is
as
sharp
and
trim
as
its
own
map
and
that
map
is
as
clear
as
a
geometrical
problem
everything
in
lucca
is
good
i
went
with
a
short
shadow
creeping
when
i
could
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
street
to
save
the
sunlight
then
i
came
to
the
main
square
and
immediately
on
my
left
was
the
albergo
di
a
fine
great
hotel
but
most
unfortunately
right
facing
the
blazing
sky
i
had
to
stop
outside
it
to
count
my
money
i
counted
it
wrong
and
entered
there
i
saw
the
master
who
talked
french
you
in
an
hour
said
i
me
a
meal
to
my
order
then
a
bed
though
it
is
early
day
this
absurd
question
i
made
less
absurd
by
explaining
to
him
my
purpose
how
i
was
walking
to
rome
and
how
being
northern
i
was
unaccustomed
to
such
heat
how
therefore
i
had
missed
sleep
and
would
find
it
necessary
in
future
to
walk
mainly
by
night
for
i
had
now
determined
to
fill
the
last
few
marches
up
in
darkness
and
to
sleep
out
the
strong
hours
of
the
sun
all
this
he
understood
i
ordered
such
a
meal
as
men
give
to
beloved
friends
returned
from
wars
i
ordered
a
wine
i
had
known
long
ago
in
the
valley
of
the
saône
in
the
old
time
of
peace
before
ever
the
greek
came
to
the
land
while
they
cooked
it
i
went
to
their
cool
and
splendid
cathedral
to
follow
a
late
mass
then
i
came
home
and
ate
their
admirable
food
and
drank
the
wine
which
the
burgundians
had
trodden
upon
the
hills
of
gold
so
many
years
before
they
showed
me
a
regal
kind
of
a
room
where
a
bed
with
great
hangings
invited
repose
all
my
days
of
marching
the
dirty
inns
the
forests
the
nights
abroad
the
cold
the
mists
the
sleeplessness
the
faintness
the
dust
the
dazzling
sun
the
apennines
all
my
days
came
over
me
and
there
fell
on
me
a
peaceful
weight
as
his
two
hundred
years
fell
upon
charlemagne
in
the
tower
of
saragossa
when
the
battle
was
done
after
he
had
curbed
the
valley
of
ebro
and
christened
bramimonde
so
i
slept
deeply
all
day
long
and
outside
the
glare
made
a
silence
upon
the
closed
shutters
save
that
little
insects
darted
in
the
outer
air
when
i
woke
it
was
evening
so
well
had
they
used
me
that
i
paid
what
they
asked
and
not
knowing
what
money
remained
over
i
left
their
town
by
the
southern
gate
crossed
the
railway
and
took
the
road
my
way
lay
under
the
flank
of
that
mountain
whereby
the
luccans
can
not
see
pisa
or
the
pisans
can
not
see
lucca
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
shall
not
live
in
either
town
god
willing
and
if
they
are
so
eager
to
squint
at
one
another
in
heaven
name
can
not
they
be
at
the
pains
to
walk
round
the
end
of
the
hill
it
is
this
laziness
which
is
the
ruin
of
many
but
not
of
pilgrims
for
here
was
i
off
to
cross
the
plain
of
arno
in
one
night
and
reach
by
morning
the
mouth
and
gate
of
that
valley
of
the
elsa
which
same
is
a
very
manifest
proof
of
how
rome
was
intended
to
be
the
end
and
centre
of
all
roads
the
chief
city
of
the
world
and
the
popes
residence
as
indeed
it
plainly
is
to
this
day
for
all
the
world
to
deny
at
their
peril
spiritual
geographical
historical
sociological
economic
and
philosophical
for
if
some
such
primeval
and
predestinarian
quality
were
not
inherent
in
the
city
how
think
you
would
the
valley
of
the
serchio
the
hot
droughty
and
baking
garfagnana
lead
down
pointing
straight
to
rome
and
how
would
that
same
line
prolonged
across
the
plain
find
fitting
it
exactly
beyond
that
plain
this
vale
of
the
elsa
itself
leading
up
directly
towards
rome
i
say
nowhere
in
the
world
is
such
a
coincidence
observable
and
they
that
will
not
take
it
for
a
portent
may
go
back
to
their
rationalism
and
consort
with
microbes
and
make
their
meals
off
logarithms
washed
down
with
an
exact
distillation
of
the
root
of
minus
one
and
the
peace
of
fools
that
is
the
deepest
and
most
balmy
of
all
be
theirs
for
ever
and
ever
here
again
you
fall
into
errors
as
you
read
ever
expecting
something
new
for
of
that
night
march
there
is
nothing
to
tell
save
that
it
was
cool
full
of
mist
and
an
easy
matter
after
the
royal
entertainment
and
sleep
of
the
princely
albergo
that
dignifies
lucca
the
villages
were
silent
the
moon
soon
left
the
sky
and
the
stars
could
not
show
through
the
fog
which
deepened
in
the
hours
after
midnight
a
map
i
had
bought
in
lucca
made
the
difficulties
of
the
first
part
of
the
road
though
there
were
many
easy
enough
and
the
second
part
in
midnight
and
the
early
hours
was
very
plain
sailing
till
having
crossed
the
main
line
and
having
at
last
very
weary
come
up
to
the
branch
railway
at
a
slant
from
the
west
and
north
i
crossed
that
also
under
the
full
light
i
stood
fairly
in
the
elsa
valley
and
on
the
highroad
which
follows
the
railway
straight
to
siena
that
long
march
i
say
had
been
easy
enough
in
the
coolness
and
in
the
dark
but
i
saw
nothing
my
interior
thoughts
alone
would
have
afforded
matter
for
this
part
but
of
these
if
you
have
not
had
enough
in
near
six
hundred
miles
of
travel
you
are
a
stouter
fellow
than
i
took
you
for
though
it
was
midsummer
the
light
had
come
quickly
long
after
sunrise
the
mist
dispersed
and
the
nature
of
the
valley
appeared
it
was
in
no
way
mountainous
but
easy
pleasant
and
comfortable
bounded
by
low
rounded
hills
having
upon
them
here
and
there
a
row
of
cypresses
against
the
sky
and
it
was
populous
with
pleasant
farms
though
the
soil
was
baked
and
dry
as
indeed
it
is
everywhere
in
this
south
yet
little
regular
streams
or
canals
irrigated
it
and
nourished
many
trees
but
the
deep
grass
of
the
north
was
wanting
for
an
hour
or
more
after
sunrise
i
continued
my
way
very
briskly
then
what
had
been
the
warmth
of
the
early
sun
turned
into
the
violent
heat
of
day
and
remembering
merlin
where
he
says
that
those
who
will
walk
by
night
must
sleep
by
day
and
having
in
my
mind
the
severe
verses
of
james
bayle
sometime
fellow
of
st
anne
that
tuscan
summers
as
a
general
rule
the
days
are
sultry
but
the
nights
are
cool
he
was
no
flamboyant
poet
he
loved
the
quiet
diction
of
the
right
wing
of
english
poetry
and
imagining
an
owlish
habit
of
sleeping
by
day
could
be
acquired
at
once
i
lay
down
under
a
tree
of
a
kind
i
had
never
seen
and
lulled
under
the
pleasant
fancy
that
this
was
a
drawn
before
the
renaissance
and
that
i
was
reclining
in
some
background
landscape
of
the
fifteenth
century
for
the
scene
was
of
that
kind
i
fell
asleep
when
i
woke
it
was
as
though
i
had
slept
long
but
i
doubted
the
feeling
the
young
sun
still
low
in
the
sky
and
the
shadows
not
yet
shortened
puzzled
me
i
looked
at
my
watch
but
the
dislocation
of
habit
which
night
marches
produce
had
left
it
unwound
it
marked
a
quarter
to
three
which
was
absurd
i
took
the
road
somewhat
stiffly
and
wondering
i
passed
several
small
white
cottages
there
was
no
clock
in
them
and
their
people
were
away
at
last
in
a
trattoria
as
they
served
me
with
food
a
woman
told
me
it
was
just
after
seven
i
had
slept
but
an
hour
outside
the
day
was
intense
already
flies
had
begun
to
annoy
the
darkened
room
within
through
the
door
the
road
was
white
in
the
sun
and
the
railway
ran
just
beyond
i
paid
my
reckoning
and
then
partly
for
an
amusement
i
ranged
my
remaining
pence
upon
the
table
first
in
the
shape
of
a
maltese
cross
then
in
a
circle
interesting
details
the
road
lay
white
in
the
sunlight
outside
and
the
railway
ran
just
beyond
i
counted
the
pence
and
the
silver
there
was
three
francs
and
a
little
over
i
remembered
the
imperial
largesse
at
lucca
the
lordly
spending
of
great
sums
where
now
in
the
pocket
of
an
obsequious
man
the
pounds
were
taking
care
of
themselves
i
remembered
how
at
como
i
had
been
compelled
by
poverty
to
enter
the
train
for
milan
how
little
was
three
francs
for
the
remaining
miles
to
siena
the
road
lay
white
in
the
sunlight
and
the
railway
ran
just
beyond
i
remembered
the
pleasing
cheque
in
the
of
siena
the
banks
of
siena
and
the
money
changers
at
their
counters
changing
money
at
the
rate
of
change
one
man
thought
i
take
five
per
cent
discount
on
a
sum
of
money
in
the
exchange
may
not
another
man
take
discount
off
a
walk
of
over
seven
hundred
miles
may
he
not
cut
off
it
as
his
due
miserable
little
miles
in
the
train
sleep
coming
over
me
after
my
meal
increased
the
temptation
alas
how
true
is
the
great
phrase
of
averroes
or
it
may
be
anyhow
the
arabic
escapes
me
but
the
meaning
is
plain
enough
that
when
one
has
once
fallen
it
is
easy
to
fall
again
saving
always
heavy
falls
from
cliffs
and
high
towers
for
after
these
there
is
no
more
falling
examine
the
horse
knees
before
you
buy
him
take
no
man
into
your
house
for
charity
touch
no
prospectus
that
has
founders
shares
and
do
not
play
with
firearms
or
knives
and
never
go
near
the
water
till
you
know
how
to
swim
oh
blessed
wisdom
of
the
ages
sole
patrimony
of
the
poor
the
road
lay
white
in
the
sun
and
the
railway
ran
just
beyond
if
the
people
of
milo
did
well
to
put
up
a
statue
in
gold
to
the
man
that
invented
wheels
so
should
we
also
put
one
up
in
portland
stone
or
plaster
to
the
man
that
invented
rails
whose
property
it
is
not
only
to
increase
the
speed
and
ease
of
travel
but
also
to
bring
on
slumber
as
can
no
drug
not
even
poppies
gathered
under
a
waning
moon
the
rails
have
a
rhythm
of
slight
falls
and
rises
they
make
a
loud
roar
like
a
perpetual
torrent
they
cover
up
the
mind
with
a
veil
once
only
when
a
number
of
men
were
shouting
like
a
to
the
clank
of
bronze
did
i
open
my
eyes
sleepily
to
see
a
hill
a
castle
wall
many
cypresses
and
a
strange
tower
bulging
out
at
the
top
such
towers
i
learned
were
the
feature
of
tuscany
then
in
a
moment
as
it
seemed
i
awoke
in
the
station
of
siena
where
the
railway
ends
and
goes
no
farther
it
was
still
only
morning
but
the
glare
was
beyond
bearing
as
i
passed
through
the
enormous
gate
of
the
town
a
gate
pierced
in
high
and
stupendous
walls
that
are
here
guarded
by
lions
in
the
narrow
main
street
there
was
full
shade
and
it
was
made
cooler
by
the
contrast
of
the
blaze
on
the
higher
storeys
of
the
northern
side
the
wonders
of
siena
kept
sleep
a
moment
from
my
mind
i
saw
their
great
square
where
a
tower
of
vast
height
marks
the
guildhall
i
heard
mass
in
a
chapel
of
their
cathedral
a
chapel
all
frescoed
and
built
as
it
were
out
of
doors
and
right
below
the
or
choir
i
noted
how
the
city
stood
like
a
queen
of
hills
dominating
all
tuscany
above
the
elsa
northward
southward
above
the
province
round
mount
amiato
and
this
great
mountain
i
saw
also
hazily
far
off
on
the
horizon
i
suffered
the
vulgarities
of
the
main
street
all
in
english
and
american
like
a
show
i
took
my
money
and
changed
it
then
having
so
passed
not
a
full
hour
and
oppressed
by
weariness
i
said
to
myself
all
my
business
is
not
with
cities
and
already
i
have
seen
far
off
the
great
hill
whence
one
can
see
far
off
the
hills
that
overhang
rome
with
this
in
my
mind
i
wandered
out
for
a
quiet
place
and
found
it
in
a
desolate
green
to
the
north
of
the
city
near
a
huge
old
church
like
a
barn
a
deep
shadow
beneath
it
invited
me
in
spite
of
the
scant
and
dusty
grass
and
in
this
country
no
one
disturbs
the
wanderer
there
lying
down
i
slept
without
dreams
till
evening
auctor
turn
to
page
lector
i
have
it
it
is
not
easy
to
watch
the
book
in
two
places
at
once
but
pray
continue
auctor
note
the
words
from
the
eighth
to
the
tenth
lines
lector
why
auctor
they
will
make
what
follows
seem
less
abrupt
once
there
was
a
man
dining
by
himself
at
the
cafe
anglais
in
the
days
when
people
went
there
it
was
a
full
night
and
he
sat
alone
at
a
small
table
when
there
entered
a
very
big
man
in
a
large
fur
coat
the
big
man
looked
round
annoyed
because
there
was
no
room
and
the
first
man
very
courteously
offered
him
a
seat
at
his
little
table
they
sat
down
and
ate
and
talked
of
several
things
among
others
of
bureaucracy
the
first
maintained
that
bureaucracy
was
the
curse
of
france
are
governed
by
it
like
sheep
the
administrator
however
humble
is
a
despot
most
people
will
even
run
forward
to
meet
him
halfway
like
the
servile
dogs
they
are
said
he
answered
the
man
in
the
big
fur
coat
should
say
men
were
governed
just
by
the
ordinary
human
sense
of
authority
i
have
no
theories
i
say
they
recognize
authority
and
obey
it
whether
it
is
bureaucratic
or
not
is
merely
a
question
of
form
at
this
moment
there
came
in
a
tall
rather
stiff
englishman
he
also
was
put
out
at
finding
no
room
the
two
men
saw
the
manager
approach
him
a
few
words
were
passed
and
a
card
then
the
manager
suddenly
smiled
bowed
smirked
and
finally
went
up
to
the
table
and
begged
that
the
duke
of
sussex
might
be
allowed
to
share
it
the
duke
hoped
he
did
not
incommode
these
gentlemen
they
assured
him
that
on
the
contrary
they
esteemed
his
presence
a
favour
is
our
prerogative
said
the
man
in
the
big
fur
coat
be
the
host
paris
entertaining
her
guest
they
would
take
no
denial
they
insisted
on
the
duke
dining
with
them
and
they
told
him
what
they
had
just
been
discussing
the
duke
listened
to
their
theories
with
some
much
and
no
little
but
with
courtesy
and
then
towards
the
coffee
told
them
in
fluent
french
with
a
strong
accent
his
own
opinion
he
had
had
eight
excellent
courses
yquem
with
his
fish
the
best
chambertin
during
the
dinner
and
a
glass
of
wonderful
champagne
with
his
dessert
he
spoke
as
follows
with
a
slight
and
rather
hard
smile
opinion
may
seem
to
you
impertinent
but
i
believe
nothing
more
subtly
and
powerfully
affects
men
than
the
aristocratic
feeling
do
not
misunderstand
me
he
added
seeing
that
they
would
protest
is
not
my
own
experience
alone
that
guides
me
all
history
bears
witness
to
the
same
truth
the
frenchmen
put
down
this
infatuation
to
the
early
training
little
knowing
that
our
english
men
of
rank
are
the
simplest
fellows
in
the
world
and
are
quite
indifferent
to
their
titles
save
in
business
matters
the
frenchmen
paid
the
bill
and
they
all
three
went
on
to
the
boulevard
said
the
first
man
to
his
two
companions
will
give
you
a
practical
example
of
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
bureaucracy
governed
mankind
he
went
up
to
the
wall
of
the
credit
lyonnais
put
the
forefinger
of
either
hand
against
it
about
centimetres
apart
and
at
a
level
of
about
a
foot
above
his
eyes
holding
his
fingers
thus
he
gazed
at
them
shifting
them
slightly
from
time
to
time
and
moving
his
glance
from
one
to
the
other
rapidly
a
crowd
gathered
in
a
few
moments
a
pleasant
elderly
short
and
rather
fat
gentleman
in
the
crowd
came
forward
and
taking
off
his
hat
asked
if
he
could
do
anything
for
him
said
our
friend
fact
is
i
am
an
engineer
section
d
of
the
public
works
department
and
i
have
to
make
an
important
measurement
in
connexion
with
the
apothegm
of
the
bilateral
which
runs
precisely
through
this
spot
my
fingers
now
mark
exactly
the
concentric
of
the
secondary
focus
whence
the
radius
vector
should
be
drawn
but
i
find
that
like
a
fool
i
have
left
my
double
refractor
in
the
cafe
hard
by
i
dare
not
go
for
fear
of
losing
the
place
i
have
marked
yet
i
can
get
no
further
without
my
double
refractor
not
let
that
trouble
you
said
the
short
stout
stranger
will
be
delighted
to
keep
the
place
exactly
marked
while
you
run
for
your
instrument
the
crowd
was
now
swelled
to
a
considerable
size
it
blocked
up
the
pavement
and
was
swelled
every
moment
by
the
arrival
of
the
curious
the
little
fat
elderly
man
put
his
fingers
exactly
where
the
had
been
effecting
the
exchange
with
a
sharp
gesture
and
each
watched
intently
to
see
that
it
was
right
to
within
a
millimetre
the
attitude
was
constrained
the
elderly
man
smiled
and
begged
the
engineer
not
to
be
alarmed
so
they
left
him
with
his
two
forefingers
well
above
his
head
precisely
centimetres
apart
and
pressing
their
tips
against
the
wall
of
the
credit
lyonnais
then
the
three
friends
slipped
out
of
the
crowd
and
pursued
their
way
us
go
to
the
theatre
said
the
experimenter
when
we
come
back
i
warrant
you
will
agree
with
my
remarks
on
bureaucracy
they
went
to
hear
the
admirable
marble
lines
of
corneille
for
three
hours
they
were
absorbed
by
the
classics
and
when
they
returned
a
crowd
now
enormous
was
surging
all
over
the
boulevard
stopping
the
traffic
and
filled
with
a
noise
like
the
sea
policemen
were
attacking
it
with
the
utmost
energy
but
still
it
grew
and
eddied
and
in
the
centre
a
little
respectful
space
kept
empty
around
him
still
stretched
the
poor
little
fat
elderly
man
a
pitiable
sight
his
knees
were
bent
his
head
wagged
and
drooped
with
extreme
fatigue
he
was
the
colour
of
old
but
still
he
kept
the
tips
of
his
two
forefingers
exactly
centimetres
apart
well
above
his
head
and
pressed
against
the
wall
of
the
credit
lyonnais
will
not
match
that
with
your
aristocratic
sentiment
said
the
author
of
the
scene
in
pardonable
triumph
am
not
so
sure
answered
the
duke
of
sussex
he
pulled
out
his
watch
is
midnight
he
said
i
must
be
off
but
let
me
tell
you
before
we
part
that
you
have
paid
for
a
most
expensive
dinner
and
have
behaved
all
night
with
an
extravagant
deference
under
the
impression
that
i
was
the
duke
of
sussex
as
a
fact
my
name
is
jerks
and
i
am
a
commercial
traveller
in
the
linseed
oil
line
and
i
wish
you
the
best
of
good
evenings
a
moment
said
the
man
in
the
big
fur
coat
theory
of
the
simple
human
sense
of
authority
still
holds
i
am
a
detective
officer
and
you
will
both
be
good
enough
to
follow
me
to
the
police
station
and
so
they
did
and
the
engineer
was
fined
fifty
francs
in
correctional
and
the
duke
of
sussex
was
imprisoned
for
ten
days
with
interdiction
of
domicile
for
six
months
the
first
indeed
under
the
prefectorial
decree
of
the
of
november
but
the
second
under
the
law
of
the
germinal
of
the
year
viii
in
this
way
i
have
got
over
between
twenty
and
thirty
miles
of
road
which
were
tramped
in
the
dark
and
the
description
of
which
would
have
plagued
you
worse
than
a
swarm
of
hornets
oh
blessed
interlude
no
struggling
moon
no
mist
no
passages
upon
the
genial
earth
no
the
sense
of
the
night
no
marvels
of
the
dawn
no
rhodomontade
no
religion
no
rhetoric
no
sleeping
villages
no
silent
towns
there
was
one
no
rustle
of
trees
just
a
short
story
and
there
you
have
a
whole
march
covered
as
though
a
brigade
had
swung
down
it
a
new
day
has
come
and
the
sun
has
risen
over
the
detestable
parched
hillocks
of
this
downward
way
no
no
lector
do
not
blame
me
that
tuscany
should
have
passed
beneath
me
unnoticed
as
the
monotonous
sea
passes
beneath
a
boat
in
full
sail
blame
all
those
days
of
marching
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
miles
that
exhausted
the
powers
of
the
mind
blame
the
fiery
and
angry
sky
of
etruria
that
compelled
most
of
my
way
to
be
taken
at
night
blame
st
augustine
who
misled
me
in
his
confessions
by
talking
like
an
african
of
icy
shores
of
italy
or
blame
rome
that
now
more
and
more
drew
me
to
herself
as
she
approached
from
six
to
five
from
five
to
four
from
four
to
three
now
she
was
but
days
off
the
third
sun
after
that
i
now
saw
rising
would
shine
upon
the
city
i
did
indeed
go
forward
a
little
in
the
heat
but
it
was
useless
after
an
hour
i
abandoned
it
it
was
not
so
much
the
sun
though
that
was
intemperate
and
deadly
it
was
rather
the
inhuman
aspect
of
the
earth
which
made
me
despair
it
was
as
though
the
soil
had
been
left
imperfect
and
rough
after
some
cataclysm
it
reminded
me
of
those
bad
lands
in
the
west
of
america
where
the
desert
has
no
form
and
where
the
crumbling
and
ashy
look
of
things
is
more
abhorrent
than
their
mere
desolation
as
soon
march
through
evil
dreams
the
north
is
the
place
for
men
eden
was
there
and
the
four
rivers
of
paradise
are
the
seine
the
oise
the
thames
and
the
arun
there
are
grasses
there
and
the
trees
are
generous
and
the
air
is
an
unnoticed
pleasure
the
waters
brim
up
to
the
edges
of
the
fields
but
for
this
bare
tuscany
i
was
never
made
how
far
i
had
gone
i
could
not
tell
nor
precisely
how
much
farther
san
quirico
the
neighbouring
town
might
be
the
imperfect
map
i
had
bought
at
siena
was
too
minute
to
give
me
clear
indications
i
was
content
to
wait
for
evening
and
then
to
go
on
till
i
found
it
an
hour
or
so
in
the
shade
of
a
row
of
parched
and
dusty
bushes
i
lay
and
ate
and
drank
my
wine
and
smoked
and
then
all
day
i
slept
and
woke
a
while
and
slept
again
more
deeply
but
how
people
sleep
and
wake
if
you
do
not
yet
know
it
after
so
much
of
this
book
you
never
will
it
was
perhaps
five
or
rather
more
when
i
rose
unhappily
and
took
up
the
ceaseless
road
even
the
goodness
of
the
italian
nature
seemed
parched
up
in
those
dry
hollows
at
an
inn
where
i
ate
they
shouted
at
me
thinking
in
that
way
to
make
me
understand
and
their
voices
were
as
harsh
as
the
grating
of
metal
against
stone
a
mile
farther
i
crossed
a
lonely
line
of
railway
then
my
map
told
me
where
i
was
and
i
went
wearily
up
an
indefinite
slope
under
the
declining
sun
and
thought
it
outrageous
that
only
when
the
light
had
gone
was
there
any
tolerable
air
in
this
country
soon
the
walls
of
san
quirico
partly
ruinous
stood
above
the
fields
for
the
smallest
places
here
have
walls
as
i
entered
its
gate
the
sun
set
and
as
though
the
cool
coming
suddenly
had
a
magic
in
it
everything
turned
kinder
a
church
that
could
wake
interest
stood
at
the
entry
of
the
town
it
had
stone
lions
on
its
steps
and
the
pillars
were
so
carved
as
to
resemble
knotted
ropes
there
for
the
first
time
i
saw
in
procession
one
of
those
confraternities
which
in
italy
bury
the
dead
they
had
long
and
dreadful
hoods
over
their
heads
with
slits
for
the
eyes
i
spoke
to
the
people
of
san
quirico
and
they
to
me
they
were
upstanding
and
very
fine
and
noble
in
the
lines
of
the
face
on
their
walls
is
set
a
marble
tablet
on
which
it
is
registered
that
the
people
of
tuscany
being
asked
whether
they
would
have
their
hereditary
duke
or
the
house
of
savoy
voted
for
the
latter
by
such
and
such
a
great
majority
and
this
kind
of
tablet
i
afterwards
found
was
common
to
all
these
small
towns
then
passing
down
their
long
street
i
came
at
the
farther
gate
to
a
great
sight
which
the
twilight
still
permitted
me
to
receive
in
its
entirety
for
san
quirico
is
built
on
the
edge
of
a
kind
of
swell
in
the
land
and
here
where
i
stood
one
looked
over
the
next
great
wave
for
the
shape
of
the
view
was
on
a
vast
scale
just
what
one
sees
from
a
lonely
boat
looking
forward
over
a
following
sea
the
trough
of
the
wave
was
a
shallow
purple
valley
its
arid
quality
hidden
by
the
kindly
glimmer
of
evening
few
trees
stood
in
it
to
break
its
sweep
and
its
irregularities
and
mouldings
were
just
those
of
a
sweep
of
water
after
a
gale
the
crest
of
the
wave
beyond
was
seventeen
miles
away
it
had
as
have
also
such
crests
at
sea
one
highest
toppling
peak
in
its
long
line
and
this
against
the
clear
sky
one
could
see
to
be
marked
by
buildings
these
buildings
were
the
ruined
castle
and
walls
of
radicofani
and
it
lay
straight
on
my
way
to
rome
it
is
a
strange
thing
arresting
northern
eyes
to
see
towns
thus
built
on
summits
up
into
the
sky
and
this
height
seemed
the
more
fantastic
because
it
was
framed
a
row
of
cypress
trees
stood
on
either
side
of
the
road
where
it
fell
from
san
quirico
and
exactly
between
these
this
high
crest
a
long
way
off
was
set
as
though
by
design
with
more
heart
in
me
and
tempted
by
such
an
outline
as
one
might
be
by
the
prospect
of
adventure
i
set
out
to
cross
the
great
bare
run
of
the
valley
as
i
went
the
mountain
of
amiato
came
more
and
more
nearly
abreast
of
me
in
the
west
in
its
foothills
near
me
were
ravines
and
unexpected
rocks
upon
one
of
them
hung
a
village
i
watched
its
church
and
one
tall
cypress
next
it
as
they
stood
black
against
the
last
of
daylight
then
for
miles
i
went
on
the
dusty
way
and
crossed
by
old
bridges
watercourses
in
which
stood
nothing
but
green
pools
and
the
night
deepened
it
was
when
i
had
crossed
the
greater
part
of
the
obscure
plain
at
its
lowest
dip
and
not
far
from
the
climb
up
to
radicofani
that
i
saw
lights
shining
in
a
large
farmhouse
and
though
it
was
my
business
to
walk
by
night
yet
i
needed
companionship
so
i
went
in
there
in
a
very
large
room
floored
with
brick
and
lit
by
one
candle
were
two
fine
old
peasants
with
faces
like
apostles
playing
a
game
of
cards
there
also
was
a
woman
playing
with
a
strong
boy
child
that
could
not
yet
talk
and
the
child
ran
up
to
me
nothing
could
persuade
the
master
of
the
house
but
that
i
was
a
very
poor
man
who
needed
sleep
and
so
good
and
generous
was
this
old
man
that
my
protests
seemed
to
him
nothing
but
the
excuses
and
shame
of
poverty
he
asked
me
where
i
was
going
i
said
rome
he
came
out
with
a
lantern
to
the
stable
and
showed
me
there
a
manger
full
of
hay
indicating
that
i
might
sleep
in
it
his
candle
flashed
upon
the
great
silent
oxen
standing
in
rows
their
enormous
horns
three
times
the
length
of
what
we
know
in
england
filled
me
with
wonder
well
may
it
count
to
me
as
gain
rather
than
seem
to
offend
him
i
lay
down
in
that
manger
though
i
had
no
more
desire
to
sleep
than
has
the
flittermouse
in
our
sussex
gloamings
also
i
was
careful
to
offer
no
money
for
that
is
brutality
when
he
had
left
me
i
took
the
opportunity
for
a
little
rest
and
lay
on
my
back
in
the
hay
and
staring
at
darkness
the
great
oxen
champed
and
champed
their
food
with
a
regular
sound
i
remembered
the
steerage
in
a
liner
the
noise
of
the
sea
and
the
regular
screw
for
this
it
exactly
resembled
i
considered
in
the
darkness
the
noble
aspect
of
these
beasts
as
i
had
seen
them
in
the
lantern
light
and
i
determined
when
i
got
to
rome
to
buy
two
such
horns
and
to
bring
them
to
england
and
have
them
mounted
for
drinking
horns
great
drinking
horns
a
yard
deep
and
to
get
an
engraver
to
engrave
a
motto
for
each
on
the
first
i
would
have
king
alfred
was
in
wantage
born
he
drank
out
of
a
ram
horn
here
is
a
better
man
than
he
who
drinks
deeper
as
you
see
thus
my
friends
drinking
out
of
it
should
lift
up
their
hearts
and
no
longer
be
oppressed
with
humility
but
on
the
second
i
determined
for
a
rousing
latin
thing
such
as
men
shouted
round
camp
fires
in
the
year
or
thereabouts
so
the
imagination
fairly
set
going
and
taking
flight
zigzag
and
this
seemed
to
suit
me

and
after
this
cogitation
and
musing
i
got
up
quietly
so
as
not
to
offend
the
peasant
and
i
crept
out
and
so
upwards
on
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
but
when
after
several
miles
of
climbing
i
neared
the
summit
it
was
already
beginning
to
be
light
the
bareness
and
desert
grey
of
the
distance
i
had
crossed
stood
revealed
in
a
colourless
dawn
only
the
mont
amiata
now
somewhat
to
the
northward
was
more
gentle
and
softened
the
scene
with
distant
woods
between
it
and
this
height
ran
a
vague
as
dry
as
the
stones
of
a
salt
beach
the
sun
rose
as
i
passed
under
the
ruined
walls
of
the
castle
in
the
little
town
itself
early
as
was
the
hour
many
people
were
stirring
one
gave
me
a
man
of
singular
character
for
here
in
the
very
peep
of
day
he
was
sitting
on
a
doorstep
idle
lazy
and
contented
as
though
it
was
full
noon
another
was
yoking
oxen
a
third
going
out
singing
to
work
in
the
fields
i
did
not
linger
in
this
crow
nest
but
going
out
by
the
low
and
aged
southern
gate
another
deeper
valley
even
drier
and
more
dead
than
the
last
appeared
under
the
rising
sun
it
was
enough
to
make
one
despair
and
when
i
thought
of
the
day
sleep
in
that
wilderness
of
the
next
night
toil
through
it
lector
what
about
the
brigand
of
radicofani
of
whom
you
spoke
in
lorraine
and
of
whom
i
am
waiting
to
hear
auctor
what
about
him
why
he
was
captured
long
ago
and
has
since
died
of
old
age
i
am
surprised
at
your
interrupting
me
with
such
questions
pray
ask
for
no
more
tales
till
we
get
to
the
really
absorbing
story
of
the
hungry
student
well
as
i
was
saying
i
was
in
some
despair
at
the
sight
of
that
valley
which
had
to
be
crossed
before
i
could
reach
the
town
of
acquapendente
or
which
i
knew
to
lie
somewhere
on
the
hills
beyond
the
sun
was
conquering
me
and
i
was
looking
hopelessly
for
a
place
to
sleep
when
a
cart
drawn
by
two
oxen
at
about
one
mile
an
hour
came
creaking
by
the
driver
was
asleep
his
head
on
the
shady
side
the
devil
tempted
me
and
without
one
struggle
against
temptation
nay
with
cynical
and
congratulatory
feelings
i
jumped
up
behind
and
putting
my
head
also
on
the
shady
side
there
were
soft
sacks
for
a
bed
i
very
soon
was
pleasantly
asleep
we
lay
side
by
side
for
hour
after
hour
and
the
day
rose
on
to
noon
the
sun
beat
upon
our
feet
but
our
heads
were
in
the
shade
and
we
slept
heavily
a
good
and
honest
sleep
he
thinking
that
he
was
alone
but
i
knowing
that
i
was
in
company
a
far
preferable
thing
and
i
was
right
and
he
was
wrong
and
the
heat
grew
and
sleep
came
out
of
that
hot
sun
more
surely
than
it
does
out
of
the
night
air
in
the
north
but
no
dreams
wander
under
the
noon
from
time
to
time
one
or
the
other
of
us
would
open
our
eyes
drowsily
and
wonder
but
sleep
was
heavy
on
us
both
and
our
minds
were
sunk
in
calm
like
old
hulls
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
sea
where
there
are
no
storms
we
neither
of
us
really
woke
until
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
which
rises
into
acquapendente
the
oxen
stopped
this
halt
woke
us
up
first
me
and
then
my
companion
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
laughed
he
seemed
to
have
thought
all
this
while
that
i
was
some
country
friend
of
his
who
had
taken
a
lift
and
i
for
my
part
had
made
more
or
less
certain
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
who
would
do
me
no
harm
i
was
right
and
he
was
wrong
i
knew
not
what
offering
to
make
him
to
compensate
him
for
this
trouble
which
his
heavy
oxen
had
taken
after
some
thought
i
brought
a
cigar
out
of
my
pocket
which
he
smoked
with
extreme
pleasure
the
oxen
meanwhile
had
been
urged
up
the
slow
hill
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
we
reached
the
famous
town
of
acquapendente
but
why
it
should
be
called
famous
is
more
than
i
can
understand
it
may
be
that
in
one
of
those
narrow
streets
there
is
a
picture
or
a
church
or
one
of
those
things
which
so
attract
unbelieving
men
to
the
pilgrim
it
is
simply
a
group
of
houses
into
one
of
these
i
went
and
upon
my
soul
i
have
nothing
to
say
of
it
except
that
they
furnished
me
with
food
i
do
not
pretend
to
have
counted
the
flies
though
they
were
numerous
and
even
had
i
done
so
what
interest
would
the
number
have
save
to
the
statisticians
now
as
these
are
patient
men
and
foolish
i
heartily
recommend
them
to
go
and
count
the
flies
for
themselves
leaving
this
meal
then
this
town
and
this
people
which
were
all
of
a
humdrum
sort
and
going
out
by
the
gate
the
left
side
of
which
is
made
up
of
a
church
i
went
a
little
way
on
the
short
road
to
san
lorenzo
but
i
had
no
intention
of
going
far
for
as
you
know
by
this
time
the
night
had
become
my
day
and
the
day
my
night
i
found
a
stream
running
very
sluggish
between
tall
trees
and
this
sight
sufficiently
reminded
me
of
my
own
country
to
permit
repose
lying
down
there
i
slept
till
the
end
of
the
day
or
rather
to
that
same
time
of
evening
which
had
now
become
my
usual
waking
hour
and
now
tell
me
lector
shall
i
leave
out
altogether
or
shall
i
give
you
some
description
of
the
next
few
miles
to
san
lorenzo
lector
why
if
i
were
you
i
would
put
the
matter
shortly
and
simply
for
it
is
the
business
of
one
describing
a
pilgrimage
or
any
other
matter
not
to
puff
himself
up
with
vain
conceit
nor
to
be
always
picking
about
for
picturesque
situations
but
to
set
down
plainly
and
shortly
what
he
has
seen
and
heard
describing
the
whole
matter
auctor
but
remember
lector
that
the
artist
is
known
not
only
by
what
he
puts
in
but
by
what
he
leaves
out
lector
that
is
all
very
well
for
the
artist
but
you
have
no
business
to
meddle
with
such
people
auctor
how
then
would
you
write
such
a
book
if
you
had
the
writing
of
it
lector
i
would
not
introduce
myself
at
all
i
would
not
tell
stories
at
random
nor
go
in
for
long
descriptions
of
emotions
which
i
am
sure
other
men
have
felt
as
well
as
i
would
be
careful
to
visit
those
things
my
readers
had
already
heard
of
auctor
the
pictures
the
remarkable
pictures
all
that
is
meant
by
culture
the
brown
photographs
oh
lector
indeed
i
have
done
you
a
wrong
and
i
would
certainly
not
have
the
bad
taste
to
say
anything
upon
religion
above
all
i
would
be
terse
auctor
i
see
you
would
not
pile
words
one
on
the
other
qualifying
exaggerating
conditioning
superlativing
diminishing
connecting
amplifying
condensing
mouthing
and
glorifying
the
mere
sound
you
would
be
terse
you
should
be
known
for
your
there
should
be
no
verbosity
in
your
style
god
forbid
still
less
pomposity
animosity
curiosity
or
ferocity
you
would
have
it
neat
exact
and
scholarly
and
above
all
chiselled
to
the
nail
a
fig
say
you
the
pip
of
a
fig
for
the
rambling
style
you
would
be
led
into
no
hilarity
charity
vulgarity
or
barbarity
eh
my
jolly
lector
you
would
simply
say
what
you
had
to
say
lector
precisely
i
would
say
a
plain
thing
in
a
plain
way
auctor
so
you
think
one
can
say
a
plain
thing
in
a
plain
way
you
think
that
words
mean
nothing
more
than
themselves
and
that
you
can
talk
without
ellipsis
and
that
customary
phrases
have
not
their
connotations
you
think
that
do
you
listen
then
to
the
tale
of
mr
benjamin
franklin
hard
a
kindly
merchant
of
cincinnati
who
had
no
particular
religion
but
who
had
accumulated
a
fortune
of
six
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
who
had
a
horror
of
breaking
the
sabbath
he
was
not
kind
husband
and
a
good
father
for
he
was
unmarried
nor
had
he
any
children
but
he
was
all
that
those
words
connote
this
man
hard
at
the
age
of
retired
from
business
and
determined
to
treat
himself
to
a
visit
to
europe
he
had
not
been
in
europe
five
weeks
before
he
ran
bang
up
against
the
catholic
church
he
was
never
more
surprised
in
his
life
i
do
not
mean
that
i
have
exactly
weighed
all
his
surprises
all
his
life
through
i
mean
that
he
was
very
much
surprised
indeed
and
that
is
all
that
these
words
connote
he
studied
the
catholic
church
with
extreme
interest
he
watched
high
mass
at
several
places
hoping
it
might
be
different
he
thought
it
was
what
it
was
not
and
then
contrariwise
he
thought
it
was
not
what
it
was
he
talked
to
poor
catholics
rich
catholics
catholics
and
elusive
wellborn
penniless
neatly
dressed
successful
catholics
also
to
pompous
vain

humble
uncertain
catholics
sneaking

healthy
howling
combative
catholics
doubtful
but
devout
catholics
fixed
crabbed

and
quod

manifeste
absurdum
videtur
intellectual
jejune
twisted
analytical
yellow
cranky
and
introspective
catholics
in
fine
he
talked
to
all
catholics
and
when
i
say
catholics
i
do
not
mean
that
he
talked
to
every
individual
catholic
but
that
he
got
a
good
integrative
grip
of
the
church
militant
which
is
all
that
the
words
connote
well
this
man
hard
got
to
know
among
others
a
certain
good
priest
that
loved
a
good
bottle
of
wine
a
fine
deep
dish
poulet
à
la
casserole
a
kind
of
egg
done
with
cream
in
a
little
platter
and
eating
such
things
this
priest
said
to
him
one
day
hard
what
you
want
is
to
read
some
books
on
catholicism
and
hard
who
was
on
the
point
of
being
received
into
the
church
as
the
final
solution
of
human
difficulties
thought
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
to
instruct
his
mind
before
baptism
so
he
gave
the
priest
a
note
to
a
bookseller
whom
an
american
friend
had
told
him
of
and
this
american
friend
had
said
will
find
mr
fingle
for
such
was
the
bookseller
name
a
honest
business
man
he
can
say
a
thing
in
a
plain
way
said
mr
hard
to
the
priest
ten
pounds
send
it
to
this
bookseller
fingle
and
he
shall
choose
books
on
catholicism
to
that
amount
and
you
shall
receive
them
and
i
will
come
and
read
them
here
with
you
so
the
priest
sent
the
money
and
in
four
days
the
books
came
and
mr
hard
and
the
priest
opened
the
package
and
these
were
the
books
inside
confession
a
history
by
a
brand
saved
from
the
burning
or
the
little
female
by
macnab
a
tale
of
the
french
huguenots
and
by
the
rev
ebenezer
catchpole
of
emmanuel
birmingham
and
by
with
a
preface
by
miss
carran
lately
rescued
from
a
canadian
convent
of
the
by
llorente
beast
with
seven
heads
or
the
apocalyptical
truce
with
the
true
cause
of
irish
of
the
latin
the
chosen
race
and
their
connexion
with
the
ten
lost
tribes
with
a
map
finally
a
very
large
book
at
the
bottom
of
the
case
called
and
it
was
no
use
asking
for
the
money
back
or
protesting
mr
fingle
was
an
honest
straightforward
man
who
said
a
plain
thing
in
a
plain
way
they
had
left
him
to
choose
a
suitable
collection
of
books
on
catholicism
and
he
had
chosen
the
best
he
knew
and
thus
did
mr
hard
who
has
recently
given
a
hideous
font
to
the
new
catholic
church
at
bismarckville
learn
the
importance
of
estimating
what
words
connote
lector
but
all
that
does
not
excuse
an
intolerable
prolixity
auctor
neither
did
i
say
it
did
dear
lector
my
object
was
merely
to
get
you
to
san
lorenzo
where
i
bought
that
wine
and
where
going
out
of
the
gate
on
the
south
i
saw
suddenly
the
wide
lake
of
bolsena
all
below
it
is
a
great
sheet
like
a
sea
but
as
one
knows
one
is
on
a
high
plateau
and
as
there
is
but
a
short
dip
down
to
it
as
it
is
round
and
has
all
about
it
a
rim
of
low
even
hills
therefore
one
knows
it
for
an
old
and
gigantic
crater
now
full
of
pure
water
and
there
are
islands
in
it
and
palaces
on
the
islands
indeed
it
was
an
impression
of
silence
and
recollection
for
the
water
lay
all
upturned
to
heaven
and
in
the
sky
above
me
the
moon
at
her
quarter
hung
still
pale
in
the
daylight
waiting
for
glory
i
sat
on
the
coping
of
a
wall
drank
a
little
of
my
wine
ate
a
little
bread
and
sausage
but
still
song
demanded
some
outlet
in
the
cool
evening
and
companionship
was
more
of
an
appetite
in
me
than
landscape
please
god
i
had
become
southern
and
took
beauty
for
granted
anyhow
seeing
a
little
cart
come
through
the
gate
harnessed
to
a
ramshackle
little
pony
bony
and
hard
and
driven
by
a
little
brown
smiling
and
contented
old
fellow
with
black
hair
i
made
a
sign
to
him
and
he
stopped
this
time
there
was
no
temptation
of
the
devil
if
anything
the
advance
was
from
my
side
i
was
determined
to
ride
and
i
sprang
up
beside
the
driver
we
raced
down
the
hill
clattering
and
banging
and
rattling
like
a
piece
of
ordnance
and
he
my
brother
unasked
began
to
sing
i
sang
in
turn
he
sang
of
italy
i
of
four
countries
america
france
england
and
ireland
i
could
not
understand
his
songs
nor
he
mine
but
there
was
wine
in
common
between
us
and
and
a
merry
heart
bread
which
is
the
bond
of
all
mankind
and
that
prime
solution
of
i
mean
the
forgetfulness
of
money
that
was
a
good
drive
an
honest
drive
a
human
aspiring
drive
a
drive
of
christians
a
glorifying
and
uplifted
drive
a
drive
worthy
of
remembrance
for
ever
the
moon
has
shone
on
but
few
like
it
though
she
is
old
the
lake
of
bolsena
has
glittered
beneath
none
like
it
since
the
etruscans
here
unbended
after
the
solemnities
of
a
triumph
it
broke
my
vow
to
pieces
there
was
not
a
shadow
of
excuse
for
this
use
of
wheels
it
was
done
openly
and
wantonly
in
the
face
of
the
wide
sky
for
pleasure
and
what
is
there
else
but
pleasure
and
to
what
else
does
beauty
move
on
not
i
hope
to
contemplation
a
hideous
oriental
trick
no
but
to
loud
notes
and
comradeship
and
the
riot
of
galloping
and
laughter
ringing
through
old
trees
who
would
change
says
aristippus
of
pslinthon
the
moon
and
all
the
stars
for
so
much
wine
as
can
be
held
in
the
cup
of
a
bottle
upturned
the
honest
man
and
in
his
time
note
you
they
did
not
make
the
devilish
deep
and
fraudulent
bottoms
they
do
now
that
cheat
you
of
half
your
liquor
moreover
if
i
broke
my
vows
which
is
a
serious
matter
and
if
i
neglected
to
contemplate
the
heavens
for
which
neglect
i
will
confess
to
no
one
not
even
to
a
postulate
it
is
no
sin
it
is
a
healthy
omission
if
i
say
i
did
this
i
did
what
peasants
do
and
what
is
more
by
drinking
wine
and
eating
pig
we
proved
ourselves
no
mohammedans
and
on
such
as
he
is
sure
of
st
peter
looks
with
a
kindly
eye
now
just
at
the
very
entry
to
bolsena
when
we
had
followed
the
lovely
lake
some
time
my
driver
halted
and
began
to
turn
up
a
lane
to
a
farm
or
villa
so
i
bidding
him
crossed
a
field
and
stood
silent
by
the
lake
and
watched
for
a
long
time
the
water
breaking
on
a
tiny
shore
and
the
pretty
miniatures
of
waves
i
stood
there
till
the
stars
came
out
and
the
moon
shone
fully
then
i
went
towards
bolsena
under
its
high
gate
which
showed
in
the
darkness
and
under
its
castle
on
the
rock
there
in
a
large
room
which
was
not
quite
an
inn
a
woman
of
great
age
and
dignity
served
me
with
fried
fish
from
the
lake
and
the
men
gathered
round
me
and
attempted
to
tell
me
of
the
road
to
rome
while
i
in
exchange
made
out
to
them
as
much
by
gestures
as
by
broken
words
the
crossing
of
the
alps
and
the
apennines
then
after
my
meal
one
of
the
men
told
me
i
needed
sleep
that
there
were
no
rooms
in
that
house
as
i
said
it
was
not
an
inn
but
that
across
the
way
he
would
show
me
one
he
had
for
hire
i
tried
to
say
that
my
plan
was
to
walk
by
night
they
all
assured
me
he
would
charge
me
a
reasonable
sum
i
insisted
that
the
day
was
too
hot
for
walking
they
told
me
did
these
etruscans
that
i
need
fear
no
extortion
from
so
honest
a
man
certainly
it
is
not
easy
to
make
everybody
understand
everything
and
i
had
had
experience
already
up
in
the
mountains
days
before
of
how
important
it
is
not
to
be
misunderstood
when
one
is
wandering
in
a
foreign
country
poor
and
i
therefore
accepted
the
offer
and
what
was
really
very
much
to
my
regret
i
paid
the
money
he
demanded
i
even
so
far
fell
in
with
the
spirit
of
the
thing
as
to
sleep
a
certain
number
of
hours
for
after
all
my
sleep
that
day
in
the
cart
had
been
very
broken
and
instead
of
resting
throughout
the
whole
of
the
heat
i
had
taken
a
meal
at
acquapendente
but
i
woke
up
not
long
after
midnight
perhaps
between
one
and
two
and
went
out
along
the
borders
of
the
lake
the
moon
had
set
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
her
hanging
at
the
quarter
in
the
clear
sky
of
that
high
crater
dipping
into
the
rim
of
its
inland
sea
it
was
perceptibly
cold
i
went
on
the
road
quite
slowly
till
it
began
to
climb
and
when
the
day
broke
i
found
myself
in
a
sunken
lane
leading
up
to
the
town
of
montefiascone
the
town
lay
on
its
hill
in
the
pale
but
growing
light
a
great
dome
gave
it
dignity
and
a
castle
overlooked
the
lake
it
was
built
upon
the
very
edge
and
lip
of
the
commanding
either
side
i
climbed
up
this
sunken
lane
towards
it
not
knowing
what
might
be
beyond
when
at
the
crest
there
shone
before
me
in
the
sunrise
one
of
those
unexpected
and
united
landscapes
which
are
among
the
glories
of
italy
they
have
changed
the
very
mind
in
a
hundred
northern
painters
when
men
travelled
hither
to
rome
to
learn
their
art
and
coming
in
by
her
mountain
roads
saw
time
and
again
the
set
views
of
plains
like
gardens
surrounded
by
sharp
and
framed
the
road
did
not
pass
through
the
town
the
grand
though
crumbling
gate
of
entry
lay
up
a
short
straight
way
to
the
right
and
below
where
the
road
continued
down
the
slope
was
a
level
of
some
eight
miles
full
of
trees
diminishing
in
distance
at
its
further
side
an
ample
mountain
wooded
of
gentle
flattened
outline
but
high
and
majestic
barred
the
way
to
rome
it
was
yet
another
of
those
volcanoes
fruitful
after
death
which
are
the
mark
of
latium
and
it
held
hidden
as
did
that
larger
and
more
confused
one
on
the
rim
of
which
i
stood
a
lake
in
its
silent
crater
but
that
lake
as
i
was
to
find
was
far
smaller
than
the
glittering
sea
of
bolsena
whose
shores
now
lay
behind
me
the
distance
and
the
hill
that
bounded
it
should
in
that
climate
have
stood
clear
in
the
pure
air
but
it
was
yet
so
early
that
a
thin
haze
hung
over
the
earth
and
the
sun
had
not
yet
controlled
it
it
was
even
chilly
i
could
not
catch
the
towers
of
viterbo
though
i
knew
them
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
far
mountain
i
went
down
the
road
and
in
or
so
was
engaged
upon
the
straight
line
crossing
the
plain
i
wondered
a
little
how
the
road
would
lie
with
regard
to
the
town
and
looked
at
my
map
for
guidance
but
it
told
me
little
it
was
too
general
taking
in
all
central
italy
and
even
large
places
were
marked
only
by
small
circles
when
i
approached
viterbo
i
first
saw
an
astonishing
wall
perpendicular
to
my
road
untouched
the
bones
of
the
middle
ages
it
stood
up
straight
before
one
like
a
range
of
cliffs
seeming
much
higher
than
it
should
its
hundred
feet
or
so
were
exaggerated
by
the
severity
of
its
stones
and
by
their
sheer
fall
for
they
had
no
ornament
whatever
and
few
marks
of
decay
though
many
of
age
tall
towers
exactly
square
and
equally
bare
of
carving
or
machicolation
stood
at
intervals
along
this
forbidding
defence
and
flanked
its
curtain
then
nearer
by
one
saw
that
it
was
not
a
huge
castle
but
the
wall
of
a
city
for
at
a
corner
it
went
sharp
round
to
contain
the
town
and
through
one
uneven
place
i
saw
houses
many
men
were
walking
in
the
roads
alongside
these
walls
and
there
were
gates
pierced
in
them
whereby
the
citizens
went
in
and
out
of
the
city
as
bees
go
in
and
out
of
the
little
opening
in
a
hive
but
my
main
road
to
rome
did
not
go
through
viterbo
it
ran
alongside
of
the
eastern
wall
and
i
debated
a
little
with
myself
whether
i
would
go
in
or
no
it
was
out
of
my
way
and
i
had
not
entered
montefiascone
for
that
reason
on
the
other
hand
viterbo
was
a
famous
place
it
is
all
very
well
to
neglect
florence
and
pisa
because
they
are
some
miles
off
the
straight
way
but
viterbo
right
under
hand
it
is
a
pity
to
miss
then
i
needed
wine
and
food
for
the
later
day
in
the
mountain
yet
again
it
was
getting
hot
it
was
past
eight
the
mist
had
long
ago
receded
and
i
feared
delay
so
i
mused
on
the
white
road
under
the
tall
towers
and
dead
walls
of
viterbo
and
ruminated
on
an
unimportant
thing
then
curiosity
did
what
reason
could
not
do
and
i
entered
by
a
gate
the
streets
were
narrow
tortuous
and
alive
all
shaded
by
the
great
houses
and
still
full
of
the
cold
of
the
night
the
noise
of
fountains
echoed
in
them
and
the
high
voices
of
women
and
the
cries
of
sellers
every
house
had
in
it
something
fantastic
and
peculiar
humanity
had
twined
into
this
place
like
a
natural
growth
and
the
separate
thoughts
of
men
both
those
that
were
alive
there
and
those
dead
before
them
had
decorated
it
all
there
were
courtyards
with
blinding
whites
of
sunlit
walls
above
themselves
in
shadow
and
there
were
many
carvings
and
paintings
over
doors
i
had
come
into
a
great
living
place
after
the
loneliness
of
the
road
there
in
the
first
wide
street
i
could
find
i
bought
sausage
and
bread
and
a
great
bottle
of
wine
and
then
quitting
viterbo
i
left
it
by
the
same
gate
and
took
the
road
for
a
long
while
yet
i
continued
under
the
walls
noting
in
one
place
a
thing
peculiar
to
the
middle
ages
i
mean
the
apse
of
a
church
built
right
into
the
wall
as
the
old
cathedral
of
st
stephen
was
in
paris
these
i
suppose
enemies
respected
if
they
could
for
i
have
noticed
also
that
in
castles
the
chapel
is
not
hidden
but
stands
out
from
the
wall
so
be
it
your
fathers
and
mine
were
there
in
the
fighting
but
we
do
not
know
their
names
and
i
trust
and
hope
yours
spared
the
altars
as
carefully
as
mine
did
the
road
began
to
climb
the
hill
and
though
the
heat
increased
for
in
italy
long
before
nine
it
is
glaring
noon
to
us
northerners
and
that
reminds
me
your
fathers
and
mine
to
whom
allusion
has
been
made
above
as
they
say
in
the
dull
history
books
lector
how
many
more
interior
brackets
are
we
to
have
is
this
algebra
auctor
you
yourself
lector
are
responsible
for
the
worst
your
fathers
and
mine
coming
down
into
this
country
to
fight
as
was
their
annual
custom
must
have
had
a
plaguy
time
of
it
when
you
think
that
they
could
not
get
across
the
alps
till
and
then
had
to
hack
and
hew
and
thrust
and
dig
and
slash
and
climb
and
charge
and
puff
and
blow
and
swear
and
parry
and
receive
and
aim
and
dodge
and
butt
and
run
for
their
lives
at
the
end
under
an
unaccustomed
sun
no
wonder
they
saw
visions
the
dear
people
they
are
dead
now
and
we
do
not
even
know
their
names
where
was
i
lector
you
were
at
the
uninteresting
remark
that
the
heat
was
increasing
auctor
precisely
i
remember
well
the
heat
was
increasing
but
it
seemed
far
more
bearable
than
it
had
been
in
the
earlier
places
in
the
oven
of
the
garfagnana
or
in
the
deserts
of
siena
for
with
the
first
slopes
of
the
mountain
a
forest
of
great
chestnut
trees
appeared
and
it
was
so
cool
under
these
that
there
was
even
moss
as
though
i
were
back
again
in
my
own
country
where
there
are
full
rivers
in
deep
meadows
and
all
the
completion
of
home
also
the
height
may
have
begun
to
tell
on
the
air
but
not
much
for
when
the
forest
was
behind
me
and
when
i
had
come
to
a
bare
heath
sloping
more
gently
upwards
a
glacis
in
front
of
the
topmost
bulwark
of
the
round
mountain
i
was
oppressed
with
thirst
and
though
it
was
not
too
hot
to
sing
for
i
sang
and
two
lonely
carabinieri
passed
me
singing
and
we
recognized
as
we
saluted
each
other
that
the
mountain
was
full
of
songs
yet
i
longed
for
a
bench
a
flagon
and
shade
and
as
i
longed
a
little
house
appeared
and
a
woman
in
the
shade
sewing
and
an
old
man
also
a
bench
and
a
table
and
a
tree
over
it
there
i
sat
down
and
drank
white
wine
and
water
many
times
the
woman
charged
me
a
halfpenny
and
the
old
man
would
not
talk
he
did
not
take
his
old
age
garrulously
it
was
his
business
not
mine
but
i
should
dearly
have
liked
to
have
talked
to
him
in
lingua
franca
and
to
have
heard
him
on
the
story
of
his
mountain
where
it
was
haunted
by
what
and
on
which
nights
it
was
dangerous
to
be
abroad
such
as
it
was
there
it
was
i
left
them
and
shall
perhaps
never
see
them
again
the
road
was
interminable
and
the
crest
from
which
i
promised
myself
the
view
of
the
was
always
just
before
me
and
was
never
reached
a
little
spring
caught
in
a
hollow
log
refreshed
a
meadow
on
the
right
drinking
there
again
i
wondered
if
i
should
go
on
or
rest
but
i
was
full
of
antiquity
and
a
memory
in
the
blood
or
what
not
impelled
me
to
see
the
lake
in
the
crater
before
i
went
to
sleep
after
a
few
hundred
yards
this
obsession
was
satisfied
i
passed
between
two
banks
where
the
road
had
been
worn
down
at
the
crest
of
the
volcano
rim
then
at
once
far
below
in
a
circle
of
silent
trees
with
here
and
there
a
vague
shore
of
marshy
land
i
saw
the
pond
of
venus
some
miles
of
brooding
water
darkened
by
the
dark
slopes
around
it
its
darkness
recalled
the
dark
time
before
the
dawn
of
our
saved
and
happy
world
at
its
hither
end
a
hill
that
had
once
been
a
cone
in
the
crater
stood
out
all
covered
with
a
dense
wood
it
was
the
hill
of
venus
there
was
no
temple
nor
no
sacrifice
nor
no
ritual
for
the
divinity
save
this
solemn
attitude
of
perennial
silence
but
under
the
influence
which
still
remained
and
gave
the
place
its
savour
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
the
gods
were
dead
there
were
no
men
in
that
hollow
nor
was
there
any
memory
of
men
save
of
men
dead
these
thousands
of
years
there
was
no
life
of
visible
things
the
mind
released
itself
and
was
in
touch
with
whatever
survives
of
conquered
but
immortal
spirits
thus
ready
for
worship
and
in
a
mood
of
adoration
filled
also
with
the
genius
which
inhabits
its
native
place
and
is
too
subtle
or
too
pure
to
suffer
the
effect
of
time
i
passed
down
the
of
the
mountain
rim
and
came
to
the
edge
overlooking
that
arena
whereon
was
first
fought
out
and
decided
the
chief
destiny
of
the
world
for
all
below
was
the
campagna
names
that
are
at
the
origin
of
things
attached
to
every
cleft
and
distant
rock
beyond
the
spreading
level
or
sanctified
the
gleams
of
rivers
there
below
me
was
veii
beyond
in
the
wall
of
the
apennines
only
just
escaped
from
clouds
was
tibur
that
dignified
the
ravine
at
the
edge
of
their
rising
that
crest
to
the
right
was
tusculum
and
far
to
the
south
but
clear
on
a
mountain
answering
my
own
was
the
mother
of
the
city
alba
longa
the
tiber
a
dense
brown
fog
rolling
over
and
concealing
it
was
the
god
of
the
wide
plain
there
and
at
that
moment
i
should
have
seen
the
city
i
stood
up
on
the
bank
and
shaded
my
eyes
straining
to
catch
the
dome
at
least
in
the
sunlight
but
i
could
not
for
rome
was
hidden
by
the
low
sabinian
hills
soracte
i
saw
there
soracte
of
which
i
had
read
as
a
boy
it
stood
up
like
an
acropolis
but
it
was
a
citadel
for
no
city
it
stood
alone
like
that
soul
which
once
haunted
its
recesses
and
prophesied
the
conquering
advent
of
the
northern
kings
i
saw
the
fields
where
the
tribes
had
lived
that
were
the
first
enemies
of
the
imperfect
state
before
it
gave
its
name
to
the
fortunes
of
the
latin
race
dark
etruria
lay
behind
me
forgotten
in
the
backward
of
my
march
a
furnace
and
a
riddle
out
of
which
religion
came
to
the
romans
a
place
that
has
left
no
language
but
below
me
sunlit
and
easy
as
it
seemed
in
the
cooler
air
of
that
summit
was
the
arena
upon
which
were
first
fought
out
the
chief
destinies
of
the
world
and
i
still
looked
down
upon
it
wondering
was
it
in
so
small
a
space
that
all
the
legends
of
one
childhood
were
acted
was
the
defence
of
the
bridge
against
so
neighbouring
and
petty
an
alliance
were
they
peasants
of
a
group
of
huts
that
handed
down
the
great
inheritance
of
discipline
and
made
an
iron
channel
whereby
even
to
us
the
antique
virtues
could
descend
as
a
living
memory
it
must
be
so
for
the
villages
and
ruins
in
one
landscape
comprised
all
the
first
generations
of
the
history
of
rome
the
stones
we
admire
the
large
spirit
of
the
last
expression
came
from
that
rough
village
and
sprang
from
the
broils
of
that
one
plain
rome
was
most
vigorous
before
it
could
speak
so
a
man
verse
and
all
he
has
are
but
the
last
outward
appearance
late
and
already
rigid
of
an
earlier
more
plastic
and
diviner
fire
this
arena
i
still
said
to
myself
first
fought
out
the
chief
destinies
of
the
world
and
so
played
upon
by
an
unending
theme
i
ate
and
drank
in
a
reverie
still
wondering
and
then
lay
down
beneath
the
shade
of
a
little
tree
that
stood
alone
upon
that
edge
of
a
new
world
and
wondering
i
fell
asleep
under
the
morning
sun
but
this
sleep
was
not
like
the
earlier
oblivions
that
had
refreshed
my
ceaseless
journey
for
i
still
dreamt
as
i
slept
of
what
i
was
to
see
and
visions
of
action
without
thought
pageants
and
mysteries
surrounded
my
spirit
and
across
the
darkness
of
a
mind
remote
from
the
senses
there
passed
whatever
is
wrapped
up
in
the
great
name
of
rome
when
i
woke
the
evening
had
come
a
haze
had
gathered
upon
the
plain
the
road
fell
into
ronciglione
and
dreams
surrounded
it
upon
every
side
for
the
energy
of
the
body
those
hours
of
rest
had
made
a
fresh
and
enduring
vigour
for
the
soul
no
rest
was
needed
it
had
attained
at
least
for
the
next
hour
a
vigour
that
demanded
only
the
physical
capacity
of
endurance
an
eagerness
worthy
of
such
great
occasions
found
a
marching
vigour
for
its
servant
in
ronciglione
i
saw
the
things
that
turner
drew
i
mean
the
rocks
from
which
a
river
springs
and
houses
all
massed
together
giving
the
steep
a
kind
of
crown
this
also
accompanied
that
picture
the
soft
light
which
mourns
the
sun
and
lends
to
the
world
it
was
cool
and
the
opportunity
beckoned
i
ate
and
drank
asking
every
one
questions
of
rome
and
i
passed
under
their
great
gate
and
pursued
the
road
to
the
plain
in
the
mist
as
it
rose
there
rose
also
a
passion
to
achieve
all
the
night
long
mile
after
mile
i
hurried
along
the
cassian
way
for
five
days
i
had
slept
through
the
heat
and
the
southern
night
had
become
my
daytime
and
though
the
mist
was
dense
and
though
the
moon
now
past
her
quarter
only
made
a
vague
place
in
heaven
yet
expectation
and
fancy
took
more
than
the
place
of
sight
in
this
fog
i
felt
with
every
step
of
the
night
march
the
approach
to
the
goal
long
past
the
place
i
had
marked
as
a
halt
long
past
sette
vene
a
light
blurred
upon
the
white
wreaths
of
vapour
distant
songs
and
the
noise
of
men
feasting
ended
what
had
been
for
many
many
hours
for
more
than
twenty
miles
of
pressing
forward
an
exaltation
worthy
of
the
influence
that
bred
it
then
came
on
me
again
after
the
full
march
a
necessity
for
food
and
for
repose
but
these
things
which
have
been
the
matter
of
so
much
in
this
book
now
seemed
subservient
only
to
the
reaching
of
an
end
they
were
left
aside
in
the
mind
it
was
an
inn
with
trellis
outside
making
an
arbour
in
the
yard
before
it
many
peasants
sat
at
table
their
beasts
and
waggons
stood
in
the
roadway
though
at
this
late
hour
men
were
feeding
some
and
housing
others
within
fifty
men
or
more
were
making
a
meal
or
a
carousal
what
feast
or
what
necessity
of
travel
made
them
keep
the
night
alive
i
neither
knew
nor
asked
but
passing
almost
unobserved
amongst
them
between
the
long
tables
i
took
my
place
at
the
end
and
the
master
served
me
with
good
food
and
wine
as
i
ate
the
clamour
of
the
peasants
sounded
about
me
and
i
mixed
with
the
energy
of
numbers
with
a
little
difficulty
i
made
the
master
understand
that
i
wished
to
sleep
till
dawn
he
led
me
out
to
a
small
granary
for
the
house
was
full
and
showed
me
where
i
should
sleep
in
the
scented
hay
he
would
take
no
money
for
such
a
lodging
and
left
me
after
showing
me
how
the
door
latched
and
unfastened
and
out
of
so
many
men
he
was
the
last
man
whom
i
thanked
for
a
service
until
i
passed
the
gates
of
rome
above
the
soft
bed
which
the
hay
made
a
square
window
unglazed
gave
upon
the
southern
night
the
mist
hardly
drifted
in
or
past
it
so
still
was
the
air
i
watched
it
for
a
while
drowsily
then
sleep
again
fell
on
me
but
as
i
slept
rome
rome
still
beckoned
me
and
i
woke
in
a
struggling
light
as
though
at
a
voice
calling
and
slipping
out
i
could
not
but
go
on
to
the
end
the
small
square
paving
of
the
via
cassia
all
even
like
a
palace
floor
rang
under
my
steps
the
parched
banks
and
strips
of
dry
fields
showed
through
the
fog
for
its
dampness
did
not
cure
the
arid
soil
of
the
campagna
the
sun
rose
and
the
vapour
lifted
then
indeed
i
peered
through
the
thick
air
but
still
i
could
see
nothing
of
my
goal
only
confused
folds
of
brown
earth
and
grasses
and
farther
off
rare
and
trees
i
passed
an
old
tower
of
the
middle
ages
that
was
eaten
away
at
its
base
by
time
or
the
quarrying
of
men
i
passed
a
divergent
way
on
the
right
where
a
wooden
sign
said
triumphal
way
and
i
wondered
whether
it
could
be
the
road
where
ritual
had
once
ordained
that
triumphs
should
go
it
seemed
lonely
and
lost
and
divorced
from
any
approach
to
sacred
hills
the
road
fell
into
a
hollow
where
soldiers
were
manoeuvring
even
these
could
not
arrest
an
attention
that
was
fixed
upon
the
approaching
revelation
the
road
climbed
a
little
slope
where
a
branch
went
off
to
the
left
and
where
there
was
a
house
and
an
arbour
under
vines
it
was
now
warm
day
trees
of
great
height
stood
shading
the
sun
the
place
had
taken
on
an
appearance
of
wealth
and
care
the
mist
had
gone
before
i
reached
the
summit
of
the
rise
there
from
the
summit
between
the
high
villa
walls
on
either
side
at
my
very
feet
i
saw
the
city
and
now
all
you
people
whatsoever
that
are
presently
reading
may
have
read
or
shall
in
the
future
read
this
my
but
book
all
you
also
that
in
the
mysterious
designs
of
providence
may
not
be
fated
to
read
it
for
some
very
long
time
to
come
you
then
i
say
entire
englobed
and
universal
race
of
men
both
in
gross
and
regardant
not
only
living
and
seeing
the
sunlight
but
dead
also
under
the
earth
shades
or
to
come
in
procession
afterwards
out
of
the
dark
places
into
the
day
for
a
little
swarms
of
you
an
army
without
end
all
you
black
and
white
red
yellow
and
brown
men
women
children
and
poets
all
of
you
wherever
you
are
now
or
have
been
or
shall
be
in
your
myriads
and
deka
myriads
and
hendeka
myriads
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
bid
you
farewell
satis
edisti
satis
atque
bibisti
tempus
abire
tibi
est
only
lector
i
keep
by
me
for
a
very
little
while
longer
with
a
special
purpose
but
even
he
must
soon
leave
me
for
all
good
things
come
to
an
end
and
this
book
is
coming
to
an
end
has
come
to
an
end
the
leaves
fall
and
they
are
renewed
the
sun
sets
on
the
vexin
hills
but
he
rises
again
over
the
woods
of
marly
human
companionship
once
broken
can
never
be
restored
and
you
and
i
shall
not
meet
or
understand
each
other
again
it
is
so
of
all
the
poor
links
whereby
we
try
to
bridge
the
impassable
gulf
between
soul
and
soul
oh
we
spin
something
i
know
but
it
is
very
gossamer
thin
and
strained
and
even
if
it
does
not
snap
time
will
at
last
dissolve
it
indeed
there
is
a
song
on
it
which
you
should
know
and
which
runs
bar
of
music
so
my
little
human
race
both
you
that
have
read
this
book
and
you
that
have
not
in
charity
i
loved
you
all
as
i
wrote
did
you
all
love
me
as
much
as
i
have
loved
you
by
the
black
stone
of
rennes
i
should
be
rich
by
now
indeed
indeed
i
have
loved
you
all
you
the
workers
all
puffed
up
and
dyspeptic
and
ready
for
the
asylums
and
you
the
lazy
drones
you
the
strong
silent
men
who
have
heads
quite
empty
like
gourds
and
you
also
the
frivolous
useless
men
that
chatter
and
gabble
to
no
purpose
all
day
long
even
you
that
having
begun
to
read
this
book
could
get
no
further
than
page
and
especially
you
who
have
read
it
manfully
in
spite
of
the
flesh
i
love
you
all
and
give
you
here
and
now
my
final
complete
full
absolving
and
comfortable
benediction
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
noticed
one
little
fault
about
you
i
will
not
call
it
fatuous
inane
and
exasperating
vanity
or
absorption
i
will
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
parable
sit
you
round
attentively
and
listen
dispersing
yourselves
all
in
order
and
do
not
crowd
or
jostle
once
before
we
humans
became
the
good
and
people
we
are
the
padre
eterno
was
sitting
in
heaven
with
st
michael
beside
him
and
he
watched
the
abyss
from
his
great
throne
and
saw
shining
in
the
void
one
far
point
of
light
amid
some
seventeen
million
others
and
he
said
is
that
and
st
michael
answered
is
the
earth
for
he
felt
some
pride
in
it
earth
said
the
padre
eterno
a
little
puzzled
earth
i
do
not
remember
very
exactly
answered
st
michael
with
as
much
reverence
as
his
annoyance
could
command
you
must
recollect
the
earth
and
all
the
pother
there
was
in
heaven
when
it
was
first
suggested
to
create
it
and
all
about
lucifer
said
the
padre
eterno
thinking
twice
it
is
attached
to
sirius
and
no
said
st
michael
quite
visibly
put
out
is
the
earth
the
earth
which
has
that
changing
moon
and
the
thing
called
the
sea
course
of
course
answered
the
padre
eterno
quickly
said
sirius
by
a
slip
of
the
tongue
dear
me
so
that
is
the
earth
well
well
it
is
years
ago
now
michael
what
are
those
little
things
swarming
up
and
down
all
over
it
said
st
michael
men
said
the
padre
eterno
i
know
the
word
as
well
as
any
one
but
somehow
the
connexion
escapes
me
men
and
he
mused
st
michael
with
perfect
said
a
few
things
a
trifle
staccato
defining
man
his
dual
destiny
his
hope
of
heaven
and
all
the
great
business
in
which
he
himself
had
fought
hard
but
from
a
fine
military
tradition
he
said
nothing
of
his
actions
nor
even
of
his
shrine
in
normandy
of
which
he
is
naturally
extremely
proud
and
well
he
may
be
what
a
hill
really
beg
your
pardon
said
the
padre
eterno
when
he
saw
the
importance
attached
to
these
little
creatures
am
sure
they
are
worthy
of
the
very
fullest
attention
and
he
added
for
he
was
sorry
to
have
offended
sensible
they
seem
michael
there
they
go
buying
and
selling
and
sailing
driving
and
wiving
and
riding
and
dancing
and
singing
and
the
rest
of
it
indeed
they
are
most
practical
and
satisfactory
little
beings
but
i
notice
one
odd
thing
here
and
there
are
some
not
doing
as
the
rest
or
attending
to
their
business
but
throwing
themselves
into
all
manner
of
attitudes
making
the
most
extraordinary
sounds
and
clothing
themselves
in
the
quaintest
of
garments
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
cried
st
michael
in
a
voice
that
shook
the
architraves
of
heaven
are
worshipping
you
they
are
worshipping
well
that
is
the
most
sensible
thing
i
have
heard
of
them
yet
and
i
altogether
commend
them
said
the
padre
eterno
and
since
then
all
has
been
well
with
the
world
at
least
where
and
so
carissimi
multitudes
all
of
you
the
day
has
long
dawned
on
the
via
cassia
this
dense
mist
has
risen
the
city
is
before
me
and
i
am
on
the
threshold
of
a
great
experience
i
would
rather
be
alone
my
readers
the
world
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
prepared
to
enter
the
city
and
i
lifted
up
my
heart
there
was
an
open
space
a
tramway
a
tram
upon
it
about
to
be
drawn
by
two
lean
and
tired
horses
whom
in
the
heat
many
flies
disturbed
there
was
dust
on
everything
around
a
bridge
was
immediately
in
front
it
was
adorned
with
statues
in
soft
stone
away
but
still
gesticulating
in
corruption
after
the
manner
of
the
seventeenth
century
beneath
the
bridge
there
tumbled
and
swelled
and
ran
fast
a
great
confusion
of
yellow
water
it
was
the
tiber
far
on
the
right
were
white
barracks
of
huge
and
of
hideous
appearance
over
these
the
dome
of
st
peter
rose
and
looked
like
something
newly
built
it
was
of
a
delicate
blue
but
made
a
metallic
contrast
against
the
sky
then
along
a
road
perfectly
straight
and
bounded
by
factories
mean
houses
and
distempered
walls
a
road
littered
with
many
scraps
of
paper
bones
dirt
and
refuse
i
went
on
for
several
hundred
yards
having
the
old
wall
of
rome
before
me
all
this
time
till
i
came
right
under
it
at
last
and
with
the
hesitation
that
befits
all
great
actions
i
entered
putting
the
right
foot
first
lest
i
should
bring
further
misfortune
upon
that
capital
of
all
our
fortunes
and
so
the
journey
ended
it
was
the
gate
of
the
poplar
not
of
the
people
ho
pedant
did
you
think
i
missed
you
hiding
and
lurking
there
many
churches
were
to
hand
i
took
the
most
immediate
which
stood
just
within
the
wall
and
was
called
our
lady
of
the
people
not
the
poplar
another
fall
for
the
learned
professor
things
go
ill
with
you
inside
were
many
fine
pictures
not
in
the
manner
but
strong
and
just
to
my
chagrin
mass
was
ending
i
approached
a
priest
and
said
to
him
quando
vel
a
quella
hora
e
la
prossimma
missa
nonas
said
he
hercle
thought
i
have
yet
twenty
minutes
to
wait
well
as
a
pilgrimage
can
not
be
said
to
be
over
till
the
first
mass
is
heard
in
rome
i
have
twenty
minutes
to
add
to
my
book
so
passing
an
egyptian
obelisk
which
the
great
augustus
had
nobly
dedicated
to
the
sun
i
entered
lector
but
do
you
intend
to
tell
us
nothing
of
rome
auctor
nothing
dear
lector
lector
tell
me
at
least
one
thing
did
you
see
the
coliseum
auctor
i
entered
a
cafe
at
the
right
hand
of
a
very
long
straight
street
called
for
bread
coffee
and
brandy
and
contemplating
my
books
and
worshipping
my
staff
that
had
been
friends
of
mine
so
long
and
friends
like
all
true
friends
inanimate
i
spent
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
my
happy
common
unshriven
exterior
and
natural
life
in
writing
down
this
loud
and
final
song
dithyrambic
epithalamium
or
threnody
in
these
boots
and
with
this
staff
two
hundred
leaguers
and
a
half
that
means
two
and
a
half
hundred
leagues
you
follow
not
two
hundred
and
one
half
league
well
two
hundred
leaguers
and
a
half

i
went
i
paced
i
tripped
i
marched
i
held
i
skelped
i

pushed
i
panted

and
dashed
i

and

i
strolled

i
crawled
and
scrambled

and
dipped
i
ranged
and
rambled
plodded
i
hobbled
i
trudged
and
tramped
i
and
in
lonely
spinnies
camped
i
and
in
haunted
pinewoods
slept
i
lingered
loitered
limped
and
crept
i
clambered
halted

and
leapt
i
slowly
sauntered
roundly

i
oh
patron

the
four
evangels

could
complain

the
world

hand
drinking
when
i
had
a
mind
to
singing
when
i
felt
inclined

turned
my
face

heart
