the
outcry
by
henry
james
book
first
i
no
my
lord
banks
had
replied
no
stranger
has
yet
arrived
but
i
ll
see
if
any
one
has
come
in
or
who
as
he
spoke
however
he
observed
lady
sandgate
s
approach
to
the
hall
by
the
entrance
giving
upon
the
great
terrace
and
addressed
her
on
her
passing
the
threshold
lord
john
my
with
which
his
duty
majestically
performed
he
retired
to
the
quarter
that
of
the
main
access
to
the
spacious
centre
of
the
house
from
which
he
had
ushered
the
visitor
this
personage
facing
lady
sandgate
as
she
paused
there
a
moment
framed
by
the
large
doorway
to
the
outer
expanses
the
small
pinkish
paper
of
a
folded
telegram
in
her
hand
had
partly
before
him
as
an
immediate
effect
the
high
wide
interior
still
breathing
the
quiet
air
and
the
fair
pannelled
security
of
the
couple
of
hushed
and
stored
centuries
in
which
certain
of
the
reputed
treasures
of
dedborough
place
beautifully
disposed
themselves
and
then
through
ample
apertures
and
beyond
the
stately
stone
outworks
of
the
great
seated
and
supported
house
uplifting
terrace
balanced
balustraded
steps
and
containing
basins
where
splash
and
spray
were
at
rest
all
the
rich
composed
extension
of
garden
and
lawn
and
park
an
ancient
an
assured
elegance
seemed
to
reign
pictures
and
preserved
pieces
cabinets
and
tapestries
spoke
each
for
itself
of
fine
selection
and
high
distinction
while
the
originals
of
the
old
portraits
in
more
or
less
deserved
salience
hung
over
the
happy
scene
as
the
sworn
members
of
a
great
guild
might
have
sat
on
the
beautiful
april
day
at
one
of
their
annual
feasts
such
was
the
setting
confirmed
by
generous
time
but
the
handsome
woman
of
considerably
more
than
forty
whose
entrance
had
all
but
coincided
with
that
of
lord
john
either
belonged
for
the
eye
to
no
such
complacent
company
or
enjoyed
a
relation
to
it
in
which
the
odd
twists
and
turns
of
history
must
have
been
more
frequent
than
any
dull
avenue
or
easy
sequence
lady
sandgate
was
shiningly
modern
and
perhaps
at
no
point
more
so
than
by
the
effect
of
her
express
repudiation
of
a
mundane
future
certain
to
be
more
and
more
offensive
to
women
of
real
quality
and
of
formed
taste
clearly
at
any
rate
in
her
hands
the
clue
to
the
antique
confidence
had
lost
itself
and
repose
however
founded
had
given
way
to
curiosity
that
is
to
speculation
however
disguised
she
might
have
consented
or
even
attained
to
being
but
gracefully
stupid
but
she
would
presumably
have
confessed
if
put
on
her
trial
for
restlessness
or
for
intelligence
that
she
after
all
almost
clever
enough
to
be
vulgar
unmistakably
moreover
she
had
still
with
her
fine
stature
her
disciplined
figure
her
cherished
complexion
her
bright
important
hair
her
kind
bold
eyes
and
her
large
constant
smile
the
degree
of
beauty
that
might
pretend
to
put
every
other
question
by
lord
john
addressed
her
as
with
a
significant
manner
that
he
might
have
had
that
of
a
lack
of
need
or
even
of
interest
for
any
explanation
about
herself
it
would
have
been
clear
that
he
was
apt
to
discriminate
with
sharpness
among
possible
claims
on
his
attention
i
luckily
find
at
least
lady
sandgate
they
tell
me
theign
s
off
she
replied
as
with
the
general
habit
on
her
side
of
bland
reassurance
it
mostly
had
easier
consequences
for
herself
than
the
perhaps
more
showy
creation
of
alarm
only
off
in
the
park
open
for
a
from
dedborough
as
you
may
have
made
out
from
the
avenue
giving
good
advice
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
to
four
hundred
and
fifty
it
was
such
a
scene
and
such
an
aspect
of
the
personage
so
accounted
for
as
lord
john
could
easily
take
in
and
his
recognition
familiarly
smiled
oh
he
s
so
great
on
such
occasions
that
i
m
sorry
to
be
missing
i
ve
to
miss
it
lady
sandgate
sighed
that
is
to
miss
the
peroration
i
ve
just
left
them
but
he
had
even
then
been
going
on
for
twenty
minutes
and
i
dare
say
that
if
you
care
to
take
a
look
you
ll
find
him
poor
dear
victim
of
duty
still
i
ll
warrant
for
as
i
often
tell
him
he
makes
the
idea
of
one
s
duty
an
awful
thing
to
his
friends
by
the
extravagance
with
which
he
always
overdoes
and
the
image
itself
appeared
in
some
degree
to
prompt
this
particular
edified
friend
to
look
at
his
watch
and
consider
i
should
like
to
come
in
for
the
grand
but
i
rattled
over
in
a
great
measure
to
meet
a
party
as
he
calls
himself
and
calls
if
you
please
even
me
who
s
motoring
down
by
appointment
and
whom
i
think
i
should
be
here
to
receive
as
well
as
a
little
i
confess
in
the
hope
of
a
glimpse
of
lady
grace
if
you
can
perhaps
imagine
i
can
imagine
it
perfectly
said
lady
sandgate
whom
evidently
no
perceptions
of
that
general
order
ever
cost
a
strain
it
quite
sticks
out
of
you
and
every
one
moreover
has
for
some
time
past
been
waiting
to
see
but
you
haven
t
then
she
added
come
from
town
no
i
m
for
three
days
at
chanter
with
my
mother
whom
as
she
kindly
lent
me
her
car
i
should
have
rather
liked
to
lady
sandgate
left
the
unsaid
in
this
connection
languish
no
longer
than
was
decent
but
whom
you
doubtless
had
to
leave
by
her
preference
just
settling
down
to
oh
to
sit
down
would
imply
that
my
mother
at
some
moment
of
the
day
gets
up
which
the
duchess
never
does
lady
only
asked
to
be
allowed
to
show
how
she
saw
it
she
fights
to
the
last
invincible
gathering
in
the
spoils
and
only
routing
her
friends
she
abounded
genially
in
her
privileged
vision
ah
yes
we
know
something
of
that
lord
john
who
was
a
young
man
of
a
rambling
but
not
of
an
idle
eye
fixed
her
an
instant
with
a
surprise
that
was
yet
not
steeped
in
compassion
you
too
then
she
wouldn
t
however
too
meanly
narrow
it
down
well
in
this
house
generally
where
i
m
so
often
made
welcome
you
see
and
where
where
he
broke
in
at
once
your
jolly
good
footing
quite
sticks
out
of
perhaps
you
ll
let
me
say
she
clearly
didn
t
mind
his
seeing
her
ask
herself
how
she
should
deal
with
so
much
rather
juvenile
intelligence
and
indeed
she
could
only
decide
to
deal
quite
simply
you
can
t
say
more
than
i
feel
and
am
proud
to
feel
at
being
of
comfort
when
they
re
this
but
fed
the
light
flame
of
his
easy
perception
which
lighted
for
him
if
she
would
all
the
facts
equally
and
they
re
worried
now
you
imply
because
my
terrible
mother
is
capable
of
heavy
gains
and
of
making
a
great
noise
if
she
isn
t
paid
i
ought
to
mind
speaking
of
that
truth
he
went
on
as
with
a
practised
glance
in
the
direction
of
delicacy
but
i
think
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
i
myself
am
not
a
bit
ignorant
of
why
it
has
made
such
an
impression
lady
sandgate
forestalled
his
knowledge
because
poor
kitty
imber
who
should
either
never
touch
a
card
or
else
learn
to
suffer
in
silence
as
i
ve
had
to
goodness
knows
has
thrown
herself
with
her
impossible
big
debt
upon
her
father
whom
she
thinks
herself
entitled
to
look
to
even
more
as
a
lovely
young
widow
with
a
good
jointure
than
she
formerly
did
as
the
mere
most
beautiful
daughter
at
she
had
put
the
picture
a
shade
interrogatively
but
this
was
as
nothing
to
the
note
of
free
inquiry
in
lord
john
s
reply
you
mean
that
our
lovely
young
widows
to
say
nothing
of
lovely
young
wives
ought
by
this
time
to
have
made
out
in
predicaments
how
to
turn
round
his
temporary
hostess
even
with
his
eyes
on
her
appeared
to
decide
after
a
moment
not
wholly
to
disown
his
thought
but
she
smiled
for
it
well
in
that
set
my
mother
s
set
however
if
she
could
smile
he
could
laugh
i
m
much
obliged
oh
she
qualified
i
don
t
criticise
her
grace
but
the
ways
and
traditions
and
tone
of
this
house
make
it
he
took
her
sense
straight
from
her
the
house
in
england
where
one
feels
most
the
false
note
of
a
dishevelled
and
bankrupt
elder
daughter
breaking
in
with
a
list
of
her
gaming
debts
to
say
nothing
of
others
and
wishing
to
have
at
least
those
wiped
out
in
the
interest
of
her
reputation
exactly
so
he
went
on
before
she
could
meet
it
with
a
diplomatic
ambiguity
and
just
that
i
assure
you
is
a
large
part
of
the
reason
i
like
to
come
here
since
i
personally
don
t
come
with
any
such
not
the
association
of
bankruptcy
no
as
you
represent
the
payee
the
young
man
appeared
to
regard
this
imputation
for
a
moment
almost
as
a
liberty
taken
how
do
you
know
so
well
lady
sandgate
what
i
represent
she
bethought
herself
but
briefly
and
bravely
well
don
t
you
represent
by
your
own
admission
certain
fond
aspirations
don
t
you
represent
the
belief
very
natural
i
grant
that
more
than
perverse
and
extravagant
flower
will
be
unlikely
on
such
a
fine
healthy
old
stem
and
consistently
with
that
the
hope
of
arranging
with
our
admirable
host
here
that
he
shall
lend
a
helpful
hand
to
your
commending
yourself
to
dear
grace
lord
john
might
in
the
light
of
these
words
have
felt
any
latent
infirmity
in
such
a
pretension
exposed
but
as
he
stood
there
facing
his
chances
he
would
have
struck
a
spectator
as
resting
firmly
enough
on
some
felt
residuum
of
advantage
whether
this
were
cleverness
or
luck
the
strength
of
his
backing
or
that
of
his
sincerity
even
with
the
young
woman
to
whom
our
friends
reference
thus
broadened
still
a
vague
quantity
for
us
you
would
have
taken
his
sincerity
as
quite
possible
and
this
despite
an
odd
element
in
him
that
you
might
have
described
as
a
certain
delicacy
of
brutality
this
younger
son
of
a
noble
matron
recognised
even
by
himself
as
terrible
enjoyed
in
no
immediate
or
aggressive
manner
any
imputable
private
heritage
or
privilege
of
arrogance
he
would
on
the
contrary
have
irradiated
fineness
if
his
lustre
hadn
t
been
a
little
prematurely
dimmed
active
yet
insubstantial
he
was
slight
and
short
and
a
trifle
too
punctually
though
not
yet
quite
lamentably
bald
delicacy
was
in
the
arch
of
his
eyebrow
the
finish
of
his
facial
line
the
economy
of
treatment
by
which
his
negative
nose
had
been
enabled
to
look
important
and
his
meagre
mouth
to
smile
its
spareness
away
he
had
pleasant
but
hard
little
eyes
they
glittered
handsomely
without
promise
and
a
neatness
a
coolness
and
an
ease
a
clear
instinct
for
making
point
take
on
his
behalf
the
place
of
weight
and
immunity
that
of
capacity
which
represented
somehow
the
art
of
living
at
a
high
pitch
and
yet
at
a
low
cost
there
was
that
in
his
satisfied
air
which
still
suggested
sharp
wants
and
this
was
withal
the
ambiguity
for
the
temper
of
these
appetites
or
views
was
certainly
you
would
have
concluded
not
such
as
always
to
sacrifice
to
form
if
he
really
for
instance
wanted
lady
grace
the
passion
or
the
sense
of
his
interest
in
it
would
scarce
have
been
considerately
irritable
may
i
ask
what
you
mean
he
inquired
of
lady
sandgate
by
the
question
of
my
arranging
i
mean
that
you
re
the
very
clever
son
of
a
very
clever
oh
i
m
less
clever
than
you
think
he
replied
if
you
really
think
it
of
me
at
all
and
mamma
s
a
good
sight
cleverer
than
i
think
lady
sandgate
echoed
why
she
s
the
person
in
all
our
world
i
would
gladly
most
resemble
for
her
general
ability
to
put
what
she
wants
but
she
at
once
added
that
is
pausing
on
it
with
a
smile
if
what
then
well
if
i
could
be
absolutely
certain
to
have
all
in
her
kinds
of
cleverness
without
exception
and
to
have
them
said
lady
sandgate
to
the
very
he
definitely
he
almost
contemptuously
declined
to
follow
her
the
very
end
of
what
she
took
her
choice
as
amid
all
the
wonderful
directions
there
might
be
and
then
seemed
both
to
risk
and
to
reserve
something
say
of
her
so
wonderfully
successful
it
doubtless
however
warranted
him
in
appearing
to
cut
insinuations
short
when
you
re
as
clever
as
she
you
ll
be
as
to
which
he
subjoined
you
don
t
begin
to
have
the
opportunity
of
knowing
how
good
she
this
pronouncement
to
whatever
comparative
obscurity
it
might
appear
to
relegate
her
his
interlocutress
had
to
take
he
was
so
prompt
with
a
more
explicit
challenge
what
is
it
exactly
that
you
suppose
yourself
to
know
lady
sandgate
had
after
a
moment
in
her
supreme
good
humour
decided
to
take
everything
i
always
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
i
know
everything
because
that
makes
people
tell
it
wouldn
t
make
we
he
quite
rang
out
if
i
didn
t
want
to
but
as
it
happens
he
allowed
there
s
a
question
it
would
be
convenient
to
me
to
put
to
you
you
must
be
with
your
charming
unconventional
relation
with
him
extremely
in
theign
s
she
waited
a
little
as
for
more
is
that
your
question
i
am
no
but
if
you
are
you
ll
the
better
answer
it
she
had
no
objection
then
to
answering
it
beautifully
we
re
the
best
friends
in
the
world
he
has
been
really
my
providence
as
a
lone
woman
with
almost
nobody
and
nothing
of
her
own
and
i
feel
my
footing
here
as
so
frequent
and
yet
so
discreet
a
visitor
simply
perfect
but
i
m
happy
to
say
that
for
my
pleasure
when
i
m
really
curious
this
doesn
t
close
to
me
the
sweet
resource
of
occasionally
guessing
then
i
hope
you
ve
ground
for
believing
that
if
i
go
the
right
way
about
it
he
s
likely
to
listen
to
lady
sandgate
measured
her
ground
which
scarce
seemed
extensive
the
person
he
most
listens
to
just
now
and
in
fact
at
any
time
as
you
must
have
seen
for
yourself
is
that
or
at
least
beautiful
wheedler
his
elder
lady
imber
s
lord
john
alertly
asked
she
arrived
last
night
and
as
we
ve
other
visitors
seems
to
have
set
up
a
in
the
then
she
ll
draw
of
course
immensely
as
she
always
does
but
her
sister
won
t
be
in
that
case
with
her
the
young
man
supposed
because
grace
feels
herself
naturally
an
independent
show
so
she
well
may
said
lady
sandgate
but
i
must
tell
you
that
when
i
last
noticed
them
there
kitty
was
in
the
very
act
of
leading
her
lord
john
figured
it
a
moment
lady
imber
he
ironically
enlarged
the
figure
lead
people
oh
dear
grace
his
companion
returned
happens
fortunately
to
be
firm
this
seemed
to
strike
him
for
a
moment
as
equivocal
not
against
however
you
don
t
mean
you
don
t
think
she
has
a
beastly
prejudice
surely
you
can
judge
about
it
as
knowing
best
what
may
or
what
mayn
t
have
happened
between
well
i
try
to
judge
and
such
candour
as
was
possible
to
lord
john
seemed
to
sit
for
a
moment
on
his
brow
but
i
m
in
fear
of
seeing
her
too
much
as
i
want
to
see
there
was
an
appeal
in
it
that
lady
sandgate
might
have
been
moved
to
meet
are
you
absolutely
in
earnest
about
her
of
course
i
am
why
shouldn
t
i
be
but
he
said
with
impatience
i
want
very
well
then
that
s
what
lady
imber
s
giving
and
as
it
appeared
to
take
him
time
to
read
into
these
words
their
full
sense
she
produced
others
and
so
far
did
help
him
though
the
effort
was
in
a
degree
that
of
her
exhibiting
with
some
complacency
her
own
unassisted
control
of
stray
signs
and
shy
lights
by
telling
her
by
bringing
it
home
to
her
that
if
she
ll
make
up
her
mind
to
accept
you
the
duchess
will
do
the
handsome
thing
handsome
i
mean
by
lord
john
appropriating
for
his
convenience
the
truth
in
this
yet
regarded
it
as
open
to
a
becoming
an
improving
touch
from
himself
well
and
by
to
which
he
added
with
more
of
a
challenge
in
it
but
you
really
know
what
my
mother
will
do
by
my
system
lady
sandgate
smiled
you
see
i
ve
guessed
what
your
mother
will
do
is
what
brought
you
over
well
it
s
that
he
allowed
and
something
something
else
she
derisively
echoed
i
should
think
that
for
an
ardent
lover
would
have
been
ah
but
it
s
all
one
job
i
mean
it
s
one
idea
he
hastened
to
explain
if
you
think
lady
imber
s
really
acting
on
mightn
t
you
go
and
see
i
would
in
a
moment
if
i
hadn
t
to
look
out
for
another
matter
and
he
renewed
his
attention
to
his
watch
i
mean
getting
straight
at
my
american
the
party
i
just
mentioned
but
she
had
already
taken
him
up
you
too
have
an
american
and
a
party
and
yours
also
motors
down
mr
breckenridge
lord
john
named
him
with
a
shade
of
elation
she
gaped
at
the
fuller
light
you
my
breckenridge
who
i
hoped
was
coming
for
me
lord
john
as
freely
but
more
gaily
wondered
had
he
told
you
so
she
held
out
opened
the
telegram
she
had
kept
folded
in
her
hand
since
her
entrance
he
has
sent
me
that
which
delivered
to
me
ten
minutes
ago
out
there
has
brought
me
in
to
receive
the
young
man
read
out
this
missive
failing
to
find
you
in
bruton
street
start
in
pursuit
and
hope
to
overtake
you
about
it
did
involve
an
ambiguity
why
he
has
been
engaged
these
three
days
to
coincide
with
myself
and
not
to
fail
of
him
has
been
part
of
my
lady
sandgate
in
her
demonstrative
way
appealed
to
the
general
rich
scene
then
why
does
he
say
it
s
me
he
s
pursuing
he
seemed
to
recognise
promptly
enough
in
her
the
sense
of
a
menaced
monopoly
my
dear
lady
he
s
pursuing
expensive
works
of
by
which
you
imply
that
i
m
one
she
might
have
been
wound
up
by
her
disappointment
to
almost
any
irony
i
imply
or
rather
i
affirm
that
every
handsome
woman
is
but
what
he
arranged
with
me
about
lord
john
explained
was
that
he
should
see
the
dedborough
pictures
in
general
and
the
great
sir
joshua
in
particular
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
and
to
which
i
ve
been
thus
glad
to
assist
this
news
however
with
its
lively
interest
but
deepened
the
listener
s
mystification
then
why
this
whole
week
that
i
ve
been
in
the
house
hasn
t
our
good
friend
here
mentioned
to
me
his
coming
because
our
good
friend
here
has
had
no
reason
lord
john
could
treat
it
now
as
simple
enough
good
as
he
is
in
all
ways
he
s
so
best
of
all
about
showing
the
house
and
its
contents
that
i
haven
t
even
thought
necessary
to
write
him
that
i
m
introducing
i
should
have
been
happy
to
introduce
him
lady
sandgate
just
quavered
if
i
had
at
all
known
he
wanted
her
companion
weighed
the
difference
between
them
and
appeared
to
pronounce
it
a
trifle
he
didn
t
care
a
fig
for
i
surrender
you
that
privilege
then
of
presenting
him
to
his
host
if
i
ve
seemed
to
you
to
snatch
it
from
to
which
lord
john
added
as
with
liberality
unrestricted
but
i
ve
been
taking
him
about
to
see
what
s
worth
while
as
only
last
week
to
lady
lappington
s
this
revelation
though
so
casual
in
its
form
fairly
drew
from
lady
sandgate
as
she
took
it
in
an
interrogative
wail
her
longhi
why
don
t
you
know
her
great
venetian
family
group
the
ems
seven
figures
each
one
a
gem
for
which
he
paid
her
her
price
before
he
left
the
she
could
but
make
it
more
richly
resound
almost
stricken
lost
in
her
wistful
thought
seven
figures
her
price
eight
thousand
slap
down
bender
knows
said
lord
john
what
he
and
does
he
want
only
her
wonder
grew
and
grew
ems
he
most
usually
wants
what
he
can
t
lord
john
made
scarce
more
of
it
than
that
but
awfully
hard
up
as
i
fancy
her
lady
lappington
went
it
determined
in
his
friend
a
boldly
critical
attitude
how
horrible
at
the
rate
things
are
leaving
us
but
this
was
far
from
the
end
of
her
interest
and
is
that
the
way
he
pays
before
he
leaves
the
house
lord
john
lived
it
amusedly
over
well
took
care
of
how
incredibly
vulgar
it
all
had
however
for
lady
sandgate
still
other
connections
which
might
have
attenuated
lady
lappington
s
case
though
she
didn
t
glance
at
this
he
makes
the
most
scandalous
eyes
the
ruffian
at
my
and
then
as
richly
to
enlighten
any
blankness
my
tremendous
lawrence
don
t
you
know
in
her
down
to
her
knees
with
such
extraordinarily
speaking
eyes
such
lovely
arms
and
hands
such
wonderful
universally
considered
the
masterpiece
of
the
lord
john
seemed
to
look
a
moment
not
so
much
at
the
image
evoked
in
which
he
wasn
t
interested
as
at
certain
possibilities
lurking
behind
it
and
are
you
going
to
the
masterpiece
of
the
artist
she
held
her
head
high
i
ve
indignantly
refused
for
all
his
pressing
me
so
yet
that
s
what
he
nevertheless
pursues
you
to
keep
up
the
question
had
a
little
the
ring
of
those
of
which
the
occupant
of
a
is
mostly
the
subject
but
lady
sandgate
was
so
far
as
this
went
an
imperturbable
witness
i
need
hardly
fear
it
perhaps
if
in
the
light
of
what
you
tell
me
of
your
arrangement
with
him
his
pursuit
becomes
where
i
am
concerned
a
figure
of
oh
lord
john
returned
he
kills
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
sees
both
sir
joshua
and
this
version
of
the
case
had
its
effect
for
the
moment
on
his
fair
associate
does
he
want
to
buy
pride
and
glory
the
young
man
however
struck
on
his
own
side
became
at
first
but
the
bright
reflector
of
her
thought
is
that
wonder
for
sale
she
closed
her
eyes
as
with
the
shudder
of
hearing
such
words
not
surely
by
monstrous
chance
fancy
dear
proud
theign
i
can
t
fancy
him
no
and
lord
john
appeared
to
renounce
the
effort
but
a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
and
a
sharp
funny
yankee
at
these
things
might
be
lady
sandgate
s
face
and
gesture
apparently
signified
but
another
question
diverted
her
you
re
clearly
a
wonderful
showman
but
do
you
mind
my
asking
you
whether
you
re
on
such
an
occasion
a
well
a
closely
interested
one
interested
he
echoed
though
it
wasn
t
to
gain
time
he
showed
for
he
would
in
that
case
have
taken
more
to
the
extent
you
mean
of
my
little
percentage
and
then
as
in
silence
she
but
kept
a
slightly
grim
smile
on
him
why
do
you
ask
if
with
your
high
delicacy
about
your
you
ve
nothing
to
place
it
took
her
a
minute
to
say
while
her
fine
eye
only
rolled
but
when
she
spoke
that
organ
boldly
rested
and
the
truth
vividly
appeared
i
ask
because
people
like
you
lord
john
strike
me
as
dangerous
to
the
how
shall
i
name
it
the
common
weal
and
because
of
my
general
strong
feeling
that
we
don
t
want
any
more
of
our
national
treasures
for
i
regard
my
as
national
to
be
scattered
about
the
there
s
much
in
this
country
and
age
he
replied
in
an
manner
to
be
said
about
the
present
however
was
not
the
time
to
say
it
all
so
he
said
something
else
instead
accompanying
it
with
a
smile
that
signified
sufficiency
to
my
friends
i
need
scarcely
remark
to
you
i
m
all
the
she
had
meanwhile
seen
the
butler
reappear
by
the
door
that
opened
to
the
terrace
and
though
the
high
bleak
impersonal
approach
of
this
functionary
was
ever
and
more
and
more
at
every
step
a
process
to
defy
interpretation
long
practice
evidently
now
enabled
her
to
suggest
as
she
turned
again
to
her
a
reading
of
it
it
s
the
friend
then
clearly
who
s
wanted
in
the
she
might
by
the
way
banks
looked
at
her
have
snatched
from
his
hand
a
missive
addressed
to
another
though
while
he
addressed
himself
to
her
companion
he
allowed
for
her
indecorum
sufficiently
to
take
it
up
where
she
had
left
it
by
her
ladyship
my
lord
who
sends
to
hope
you
ll
join
them
below
the
ah
grace
hopes
said
lady
sandgate
for
the
young
man
s
encouragement
there
you
are
lord
john
took
up
the
he
had
lain
down
on
coming
in
i
rush
to
lady
grace
but
don
t
demoralise
bender
and
he
went
forth
to
the
terrace
and
the
gardens
banks
looked
about
as
for
some
further
exercise
of
his
high
function
will
you
have
tea
my
lady
this
appeared
to
strike
her
as
premature
oh
thanks
when
they
all
come
they
ll
scarcely
my
lady
he
indicated
respectfully
that
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
there
s
tea
in
her
ladyship
s
tent
but
he
qualified
it
has
also
been
ordered
for
the
ah
then
she
said
cheerfully
mr
bender
will
be
glad
and
she
became
with
this
aware
of
the
approach
of
another
visitor
banks
considered
up
and
down
the
gentleman
ushered
in
at
the
left
by
the
footman
who
had
received
him
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
house
here
he
must
be
my
with
which
he
retired
to
the
spacious
opposite
quarter
where
he
vanished
while
the
footman
his
own
office
performed
retreated
as
he
had
come
and
lady
sandgate
all
hospitality
received
the
author
of
her
specious
telegram
of
lord
john
s
irritating
confidence
and
of
lady
lappington
s
massive
cheque
ii
having
greeted
him
with
an
explicitly
gracious
welcome
and
both
hands
out
she
had
at
once
gone
on
you
ll
of
course
have
tea
in
the
but
his
mechanism
seemed
of
the
type
that
has
to
expand
and
revolve
before
sounding
why
the
very
first
thing
she
only
desired
as
her
laugh
showed
to
accommodate
ah
have
it
the
last
if
you
like
you
see
your
english
teas
he
pleaded
as
he
looked
about
him
so
immediately
and
frankly
interested
in
the
place
and
its
contents
that
his
friend
could
only
have
taken
this
for
the
very
glance
with
which
he
must
have
swept
lady
lappington
s
inferior
scene
they
re
too
much
for
you
well
they
re
too
many
i
think
i
ve
had
two
or
three
on
the
road
at
any
rate
my
man
did
i
like
to
do
business
before
but
his
sequence
dropped
as
his
eye
caught
some
object
across
the
wealth
of
space
she
divertedly
picked
it
up
before
tea
bender
before
everything
lady
he
was
immensely
genial
but
a
queer
quaint
distinctness
somehow
kept
it
safe
for
himself
then
you
ve
to
do
business
her
appeal
and
her
emphasis
melted
as
into
a
caress
which
however
spent
itself
on
his
large
high
person
as
he
consented
with
less
of
demonstration
but
more
of
attention
to
look
down
upon
her
she
could
therefore
but
reinforce
it
by
an
intenser
note
to
tell
me
you
treat
bender
had
six
feet
of
stature
and
an
air
as
of
having
received
benefits
at
the
hands
of
fortune
substantial
powerful
easy
he
shone
as
with
a
glorious
cleanness
a
supplied
and
equipped
and
appointed
sanity
and
security
aids
to
action
that
might
have
figured
a
pair
of
very
ample
wings
wide
pinions
for
the
present
conveniently
folded
but
that
he
would
certainly
on
occasion
agitate
for
great
efforts
and
spread
for
great
flights
these
things
would
have
made
him
quite
an
admirable
even
a
worshipful
image
of
life
and
character
had
not
the
affirmation
and
the
emphasis
halted
in
one
important
particular
fortune
felicity
nature
the
perverse
or
interfering
old
fairy
at
his
whatever
the
ministering
power
might
have
been
had
simply
overlooked
and
neglected
his
vast
face
which
thus
showed
not
so
much
for
perfunctorily
scamped
as
for
not
treated
as
for
neither
formed
nor
fondled
nor
finished
at
all
nothing
seemed
to
have
been
done
for
it
but
what
the
razor
and
the
sponge
the
and
the
could
officiously
do
it
had
in
short
resisted
any
possibly
finer
attrition
at
the
hands
of
fifty
years
of
offered
experience
it
had
developed
on
the
lines
if
lines
they
could
be
called
of
the
mere
scoured
and
polished
and
initialled
mug
rather
than
to
any
effect
of
a
composed
physiognomy
though
we
must
at
the
same
time
add
that
its
wearer
carried
this
featureless
disk
as
with
the
warranted
confidence
that
might
have
attended
a
warning
headlight
or
a
glaring
the
object
however
one
named
it
showed
you
at
least
where
he
was
and
most
often
that
he
was
straight
upon
you
it
was
fearlessly
and
resistingly
across
the
path
of
his
advance
that
lady
sandgate
had
thrown
herself
and
indeed
with
such
success
that
he
soon
connected
her
demonstration
with
a
particular
motive
for
your
grandmother
lady
sandgate
he
then
returned
for
my
grandmother
s
bender
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
her
time
and
the
greatest
of
all
lawrences
no
matter
whose
as
you
quite
acknowledged
you
know
in
our
talk
in
bruton
bender
bethought
himself
further
yet
drawing
it
out
as
if
the
familiar
fact
of
his
being
made
up
to
had
never
had
such
special
softness
and
warmth
of
pressure
do
you
want
very
much
she
had
already
caught
him
up
very
very
much
for
her
well
bender
she
smilingly
replied
i
think
i
should
like
her
full
i
mean
he
kindly
discriminated
do
you
want
so
badly
to
work
her
off
it
would
be
an
intense
convenience
to
me
so
much
so
that
your
telegram
made
me
at
once
fondly
hope
you
d
be
arriving
to
such
measure
of
response
as
he
had
given
her
was
the
mere
frayed
edge
of
a
mastering
detachment
the
copious
impatient
range
elsewhere
of
his
true
attention
somehow
however
he
still
seemed
kind
even
while
turning
his
back
upon
her
he
moved
off
to
look
at
one
of
the
several
the
famous
dedborough
pictures
stray
specimens
by
every
presumption
lost
a
little
in
the
whole
bright
bigness
conclude
he
echoed
as
he
approached
a
significantly
small
canvas
you
ladies
want
to
get
there
before
the
road
s
so
much
as
laid
or
the
country
s
safe
do
you
know
what
this
is
he
at
once
went
on
oh
you
can
t
have
she
cried
as
with
full
authority
and
you
must
really
understand
that
you
can
t
have
everything
you
mustn
t
expect
to
ravage
he
had
his
nose
meanwhile
close
to
the
picture
i
guess
it
s
a
bogus
cuyp
but
i
know
lord
theign
things
he
won
t
do
business
he
s
not
in
the
least
and
can
never
be
in
my
tight
place
lady
sandgate
replied
but
he
s
as
proud
as
he
s
kind
dear
man
and
as
solid
as
he
s
proud
so
that
if
you
came
down
under
a
different
impression
well
she
could
only
exhale
the
folly
of
his
error
with
an
unction
that
represented
whatever
he
might
think
of
it
all
her
competence
to
answer
for
their
host
he
scarce
thought
of
it
enough
on
any
side
however
to
be
diverted
from
prior
dispositions
i
came
on
an
understanding
that
i
should
find
my
friend
lord
john
and
that
lord
theign
would
on
his
introduction
kindly
let
me
look
round
but
being
before
lunch
in
bruton
street
i
knocked
at
your
door
for
another
look
she
quickly
interposed
at
my
lawrence
for
another
look
at
lady
sandgate
your
wasn
t
required
informed
you
were
here
and
struck
with
the
coincidence
of
my
being
myself
presently
due
he
went
on
i
despatched
you
my
wire
on
coming
away
just
to
keep
up
your
you
keep
them
up
you
depress
them
to
anguish
she
almost
passionately
protested
when
you
don
t
tell
me
you
ll
treat
he
paused
in
his
preoccupation
his
perambulation
conscious
evidently
of
no
reluctance
that
was
worth
a
scene
with
so
charming
and
so
hungry
a
woman
well
if
it
s
a
question
of
your
otherwise
suffering
torments
may
i
have
another
interview
with
the
old
lady
dear
bender
she
s
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
she
only
yearns
for
interviews
and
you
may
have
lady
sandgate
earnestly
declared
as
many
as
you
oh
you
must
be
there
to
protect
me
then
as
soon
as
i
return
well
it
clearly
cost
him
little
to
say
i
ll
come
right
she
joyously
registered
the
vow
only
meanwhile
then
please
never
a
word
never
a
word
certainly
but
where
all
this
time
bender
asked
is
lord
john
lady
sandgate
as
he
spoke
found
her
eyes
meeting
those
of
a
young
woman
who
presenting
herself
from
without
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
to
the
terrace
a
slight
fair
grave
young
woman
of
middle
stature
and
simply
dressed
whose
brow
showed
clear
even
under
the
heavy
shade
of
a
large
hat
surmounted
with
big
black
bows
and
feathers
her
eyes
had
vaguely
questioned
those
of
her
elder
who
at
once
replied
to
the
gentleman
forming
the
subject
of
their
inquiry
lady
grace
must
at
this
the
young
woman
came
forward
and
lady
sandgate
introduced
the
visitor
my
dear
grace
this
is
breckenridge
the
younger
daughter
of
the
house
might
have
arrived
in
preoccupation
but
she
had
urbanity
to
spare
of
whom
lord
john
has
told
me
she
returned
and
whom
i
m
glad
to
see
lord
john
she
explained
to
his
waiting
friend
is
detained
a
moment
in
the
park
open
to
a
big
temperance
where
our
party
is
mostly
gathered
so
that
if
you
care
to
go
out
she
gave
him
in
fine
his
choice
but
this
was
clearly
a
thing
that
in
the
conditions
bender
wasn
t
the
man
to
take
precipitately
though
his
big
useful
smile
disguised
his
prudence
are
there
any
pictures
in
the
park
lady
grace
s
facial
response
represented
less
humour
perhaps
but
more
play
we
find
our
park
itself
rather
a
bender
s
own
levity
at
any
rate
persisted
with
a
big
temperance
mr
bender
s
a
great
judge
of
pictures
lady
sandgate
said
as
to
forestall
any
impression
of
excessive
freedom
will
there
be
more
tea
he
pursued
almost
presuming
on
this
it
showed
lady
grace
for
comparatively
candid
and
literal
oh
there
ll
be
plenty
of
this
appeared
to
determine
bender
well
lady
grace
i
m
after
pictures
but
i
take
them
may
i
go
right
round
here
perhaps
love
lady
sandgate
at
once
said
you
ll
let
me
show
a
moment
dear
lady
grace
gently
demurred
do
go
round
she
conformably
added
to
bender
take
your
ease
and
your
time
everything
s
open
and
visible
and
with
our
whole
company
dispersed
you
ll
have
the
place
to
he
rose
in
his
genial
mass
to
the
opportunity
i
ll
be
in
clover
sure
but
present
to
him
was
the
richest
corner
of
the
pasture
which
he
could
fluently
enough
name
and
i
ll
find
the
beautiful
duchess
of
waterbridge
she
indicated
off
to
the
right
where
a
stately
perspective
opened
the
quarter
of
the
saloon
to
which
we
have
seen
banks
retire
at
the
very
end
of
he
had
wide
eyes
for
the
vista
about
thirty
in
a
row
hey
and
he
was
already
off
i
ll
work
right
through
iii
left
with
her
friend
lady
grace
had
a
prompt
question
lord
john
warned
me
he
was
funny
but
you
already
know
him
there
might
have
been
a
sense
of
embarrassment
in
the
way
in
which
as
to
gain
time
lady
sandgate
pointed
instead
of
answering
to
the
small
picture
pronounced
upon
by
bender
he
thinks
your
little
cuyp
a
that
one
lady
grace
could
but
stare
the
wretch
however
she
made
without
alarm
no
more
of
it
she
returned
to
her
previous
question
you
ve
met
him
before
just
a
little
in
town
being
after
pictures
lady
sandgate
explained
he
has
been
after
my
she
said
lady
grace
with
amusement
must
have
found
him
funny
but
he
can
clearly
take
care
of
himself
while
kitty
takes
care
of
lord
john
and
while
you
if
you
ll
be
so
good
go
back
to
support
father
in
the
hour
of
his
triumph
which
he
wants
you
so
much
to
witness
that
he
complains
of
your
desertion
and
goes
so
far
as
to
speak
of
you
as
sneaking
lady
sandgate
with
a
slight
flush
turned
it
over
i
delight
in
his
triumph
and
whatever
i
do
is
at
least
above
board
but
if
it
s
a
question
of
support
aren
t
you
yourself
failing
him
quite
as
much
this
had
however
no
effect
on
the
girl
s
confidence
ah
my
dear
i
m
not
at
all
the
same
thing
and
as
i
m
the
person
in
the
world
he
least
misses
well
such
a
fact
spoke
for
itself
you
ve
been
free
to
return
and
wait
for
lord
john
that
was
the
sense
in
which
the
elder
woman
appeared
to
prefer
to
understand
it
as
speaking
the
tone
of
it
none
the
less
led
her
companion
immediately
though
very
quietly
to
correct
her
i
ve
not
come
back
to
wait
for
lord
then
he
hasn
t
told
you
if
you
ve
talked
with
what
idea
he
has
come
lady
grace
had
for
a
further
correction
the
same
shade
of
detachment
kitty
has
told
me
what
it
suits
her
to
pretend
to
and
kitty
s
pretensions
and
suppositions
always
go
with
what
happens
at
the
moment
among
all
her
wonderful
happenings
to
suit
her
lady
grace
let
that
question
answer
itself
she
took
the
case
up
further
on
what
i
can
t
make
out
is
why
this
so
suit
her
and
what
can
t
said
lady
sandgate
without
gross
honesty
and
turning
away
after
having
watched
the
girl
a
moment
she
nevertheless
presently
faced
her
again
to
follow
this
speculation
up
do
you
like
him
enough
to
risk
the
chance
of
kitty
s
being
for
once
right
lady
grace
gave
it
a
thought
with
which
she
moved
away
i
don
t
know
how
much
i
like
him
nor
how
little
cried
her
friend
who
evidently
found
amusement
in
the
tone
of
it
and
you
re
not
disposed
to
take
the
time
to
find
out
he
s
at
least
better
than
the
the
others
lady
grace
was
blank
for
them
the
others
of
his
oh
his
set
that
wouldn
t
be
difficult
by
what
i
imagine
of
some
of
them
but
he
means
well
enough
the
girl
added
he
s
very
charming
and
does
me
great
it
determined
in
her
companion
about
to
leave
her
another
brief
arrest
then
may
i
tell
your
father
this
in
turn
brought
about
in
lady
grace
an
immediate
drop
of
the
subject
tell
my
father
please
that
i
m
expecting
crimble
of
whom
i
ve
spoken
to
him
even
if
he
doesn
t
remember
and
who
bicycles
this
afternoon
ten
miles
over
from
where
he
s
staying
with
some
people
we
don
t
know
to
look
at
the
pictures
about
which
he
s
awfully
lady
sandgate
took
it
in
ah
like
bender
no
not
at
all
i
think
like
this
appeared
to
move
in
the
elder
woman
some
deeper
thought
may
i
ask
then
if
one
s
to
meet
him
who
he
is
oh
father
knows
or
ought
to
that
i
sat
next
him
in
london
a
month
ago
at
dinner
and
that
he
then
told
me
he
was
working
tooth
and
nail
at
what
he
called
the
wonderful
modern
science
of
connoisseurship
which
is
upsetting
as
perhaps
you
re
not
aware
all
the
canons
of
everything
we
ve
stupidly
thought
right
and
held
dear
that
he
was
to
spend
easter
in
these
parts
and
that
he
should
like
greatly
to
be
allowed
some
day
to
come
over
and
make
acquaintance
with
our
things
i
told
him
lady
grace
wound
up
that
nothing
would
be
easier
a
note
from
him
arrived
before
dinner
lady
sandgate
jumped
the
rest
and
it
s
for
him
you
ve
come
it
s
for
him
i
ve
come
in
the
girl
assented
with
serenity
very
good
though
he
sounds
most
detrimental
but
will
you
first
just
tell
me
whether
when
you
sent
in
ten
minutes
ago
for
lord
john
to
come
out
to
you
it
was
wholly
of
your
own
movement
and
she
followed
it
up
as
her
young
friend
appeared
to
hesitate
was
it
because
you
knew
why
he
had
arrived
the
young
friend
hesitated
still
why
so
particularly
to
speak
to
since
he
was
expected
and
mightn
t
know
where
i
was
lady
grace
said
after
an
instant
i
wanted
naturally
to
be
civil
to
and
had
he
time
there
to
tell
you
lady
asked
how
very
civil
he
wants
to
be
to
you
no
only
to
tell
me
that
his
friend
who
s
off
there
was
coming
for
kitty
at
once
appropriated
him
and
was
still
in
possession
when
i
came
then
as
deciding
at
last
on
perfect
frankness
lady
grace
went
on
if
you
want
to
know
i
sent
for
news
of
him
because
kitty
insisted
on
my
doing
so
saying
so
very
oddly
and
quite
in
her
own
way
that
she
herself
didn
t
wish
to
appear
in
she
had
done
nothing
but
say
to
me
for
an
hour
rather
worryingly
what
you
ve
just
said
that
it
s
me
he
s
what
like
bender
she
calls
after
but
as
soon
as
he
appeared
she
pounced
on
him
and
i
left
him
i
assure
you
quite
resignedly
in
her
she
wants
it
was
easy
for
lady
sandgate
to
remark
to
talk
of
you
to
i
don
t
know
she
wants
the
girl
replied
as
with
rather
a
tired
patience
kitty
wants
so
many
things
at
once
she
always
wants
money
in
quantities
to
begin
with
and
all
to
throw
so
horribly
away
so
that
whenever
i
see
her
in
so
very
deep
with
any
one
i
always
imagine
her
appealing
for
some
new
tip
as
to
how
it
s
to
be
come
kitty
s
an
abyss
i
grant
you
and
with
my
disinterested
devotion
to
your
father
in
requital
of
all
his
kindness
to
me
since
lord
sandgate
s
death
and
since
your
mother
s
i
can
never
be
too
grateful
to
you
my
dear
for
your
being
so
different
a
creature
but
what
is
she
going
to
gain
financially
lady
pursued
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
her
adverb
by
working
up
our
friend
s
confidence
in
your
listening
to
him
if
you
to
listen
i
haven
t
in
the
least
engaged
to
listen
said
lady
grace
it
will
depend
on
the
music
he
makes
but
she
added
with
light
cynicism
perhaps
she
s
to
gain
a
commission
on
his
fairly
getting
you
and
then
as
the
girl
assented
by
silence
is
he
in
a
position
to
pay
her
one
lady
sandgate
asked
i
dare
say
the
duchess
is
but
do
you
see
the
duchess
money
with
all
that
kitty
as
we
re
not
ignorant
owes
her
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
lady
sandgate
piled
them
up
her
young
friend
s
gesture
checked
it
ah
don
t
tell
me
how
many
it
s
too
sad
and
too
ugly
and
too
wrong
to
which
however
lady
grace
added
but
perhaps
that
will
be
just
her
way
and
then
as
her
companion
seemed
for
the
moment
not
quite
to
follow
by
letting
kitty
off
her
you
mean
that
kitty
goes
free
if
lord
john
wins
your
promise
kitty
goes
she
has
her
creditor
s
release
for
every
and
if
he
only
fails
why
then
of
course
said
now
quite
lucid
lady
grace
she
throws
herself
more
than
ever
on
poor
poor
father
indeed
lady
sandgate
richly
sighed
it
it
appeared
even
to
create
in
the
younger
woman
a
sense
of
excess
yes
but
he
after
all
and
in
spite
of
everything
adores
to
the
point
you
mean
for
lady
sandgate
could
clearly
but
wonder
of
really
sacrificing
you
the
weight
of
lady
grace
s
charming
deep
eyes
on
her
face
made
her
pause
while
at
some
length
she
gave
back
this
look
and
the
interchange
determined
in
the
girl
a
grave
appeal
you
think
i
be
sacrificed
if
i
married
him
lady
sandgate
replied
though
with
an
equal
emphasis
indirectly
you
marry
him
lady
grace
waited
a
moment
do
you
mean
for
kitty
for
himself
even
if
they
should
convince
you
among
them
that
he
cares
for
lady
grace
had
another
delay
well
he
s
his
awful
mother
s
yes
but
you
wouldn
t
marry
his
no
but
i
should
only
be
the
more
uncomfortably
and
intimately
conscious
of
even
when
lady
sandgate
optimistically
put
it
she
so
markedly
likes
you
this
determined
in
the
girl
a
fine
impatience
she
doesn
t
like
me
she
only
me
which
is
a
very
different
thing
wants
me
for
my
father
s
so
particularly
beautiful
position
and
my
mother
s
so
supremely
great
people
and
for
everything
we
have
been
and
have
done
and
still
are
and
still
have
except
of
course
poor
to
this
luminous
account
of
the
matter
lady
turned
as
to
a
genial
i
see
indeed
for
the
general
immaculate
the
words
had
no
note
of
irony
but
lady
grace
in
her
great
seriousness
glanced
with
deprecation
at
the
possibility
well
we
had
false
notes
we
ve
scarcely
even
had
bad
yes
you
ve
been
beatific
lady
sandgate
enviously
quite
ruefully
felt
it
but
any
further
treatment
of
the
question
was
checked
by
the
of
the
footman
a
demonstration
explained
by
the
concomitant
appearance
of
a
young
man
in
eyeglasses
and
with
the
ends
of
his
trousers
clipped
together
as
for
cycling
this
must
be
your
friend
she
had
only
time
to
say
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
with
which
alert
and
reminded
of
how
she
was
awaited
elsewhere
she
retreated
before
her
companion
s
visitor
who
had
come
in
with
his
guide
from
the
vestibule
she
passed
away
to
the
terrace
and
the
gardens
hugh
crimble
s
announced
name
ringing
in
her
ears
to
some
effect
that
we
are
as
yet
not
qualified
to
discern
iv
lady
grace
had
turned
to
meet
hugh
crimble
whose
pleasure
in
at
once
finding
her
lighted
his
keen
countenance
and
broke
into
easy
words
so
awfully
kind
of
you
in
the
midst
of
the
great
doings
i
noticed
to
have
found
a
beautiful
minute
for
i
left
the
great
doings
which
are
almost
over
to
every
one
s
relief
i
think
the
girl
returned
so
that
your
precious
time
shouldn
t
be
taken
to
hunt
for
it
was
clearly
for
him
on
this
bright
answer
as
if
her
white
hand
were
holding
out
the
perfect
flower
of
felicity
you
came
in
from
your
revels
on
purpose
with
the
same
charity
you
showed
me
from
that
first
moment
they
stood
smiling
at
each
other
as
in
an
exchange
of
sympathy
already
confessed
and
even
as
if
finding
that
their
relation
had
grown
during
the
lapse
of
contact
she
recognising
the
effect
of
what
they
had
originally
felt
as
bravely
as
he
might
name
it
what
the
fine
slightly
long
oval
of
her
essentially
quiet
face
quiet
in
spite
of
certain
vague
depths
of
reference
to
forces
of
the
strong
high
order
forces
involved
and
implanted
yet
also
rather
spent
in
the
process
kept
in
range
from
under
her
redundant
black
hat
was
the
strength
of
expression
the
directness
of
communication
that
her
guest
appeared
to
borrow
from
the
unframed
and
unattached
nippers
unceasingly
perched
by
their
mere
rims
as
she
remembered
on
the
bony
bridge
of
his
indescribably
authoritative
since
it
was
at
the
same
time
decidedly
inquisitive
young
nose
she
must
however
also
have
embraced
in
this
contemplation
she
must
more
or
less
again
have
interpreted
his
main
physiognomic
mark
the
degree
to
which
his
clean
jaw
was
underhung
and
his
lower
lip
protruded
a
lapse
of
regularity
made
evident
by
a
suppression
of
beard
and
moustache
as
complete
as
that
practised
by
bender
though
without
the
appearance
consequent
in
the
latter
s
case
that
of
the
flagrantly
vain
appeal
in
the
countenance
for
some
other
exhibition
of
a
history
of
a
process
of
production
than
this
so
superficial
one
with
the
interested
and
interesting
girl
sufficiently
under
our
attention
while
we
thus
try
to
evoke
her
we
may
even
make
out
some
wonder
in
her
as
to
why
the
so
perceptibly
protrusive
lower
lip
of
this
acquaintance
of
an
hour
or
two
should
positively
have
contributed
to
his
being
handsome
instead
of
much
more
logically
interfering
with
it
we
might
in
fact
in
such
a
case
even
have
followed
her
into
another
and
no
less
refined
a
speculation
the
question
of
whether
the
surest
seat
of
his
good
looks
mightn
t
after
all
be
his
high
fair
if
somewhat
narrow
forehead
crowned
with
short
crisp
brown
hair
and
which
after
a
fashion
of
its
own
predominated
without
overhanging
he
spoke
after
they
had
stood
just
face
to
face
almost
long
enough
for
awkwardness
i
haven
t
forgotten
one
item
of
your
kindness
to
me
on
that
rather
bleak
bleak
do
you
call
it
she
laughed
why
i
found
it
rather
tropical
my
neighbour
on
the
other
side
wanted
to
talk
to
me
of
the
white
then
you
made
it
doubtless
bleak
for
let
us
say
couldn
t
let
you
alone
i
remember
about
it
was
like
a
shipwrecked
signal
to
a
sail
on
the
this
obviously
meant
for
the
young
man
exactly
what
surrounded
him
he
had
begun
like
bender
to
be
conscious
of
a
thick
solicitation
of
the
eye
and
much
more
than
he
doubtless
of
a
tug
at
the
imagination
and
he
broke
characteristically
you
would
have
been
sure
into
a
great
free
gaiety
of
recognition
oh
we
ve
nothing
particular
in
the
hall
lady
grace
amiably
objected
nothing
i
see
but
claudes
and
cuyps
i
m
an
ogre
he
said
before
a
new
and
rare
feast
she
happily
took
up
his
figure
then
won
t
you
begin
as
a
first
course
with
tea
after
your
ride
if
the
other
that
is
for
there
has
been
an
ogre
before
you
has
left
some
tea
with
pleasure
he
looked
all
his
longing
though
when
you
talk
of
a
i
should
have
supposed
that
on
such
a
day
as
this
especially
you
d
find
yourselves
running
a
continuous
d
ah
we
can
t
work
sports
in
our
gallery
and
saloon
the
banging
or
whacking
and
shoving
amusements
that
are
all
most
people
care
for
unless
perhaps
lady
grace
went
on
your
own
peculiar
one
as
i
understand
you
of
playing
football
with
the
old
benighted
traditions
and
attributions
you
everywhere
meet
in
fact
i
think
you
said
the
old
idiotic
hugh
crimble
went
more
than
to
meet
this
description
of
his
fondest
activity
he
indeed
even
beckoned
it
on
the
names
and
stories
and
styles
the
so
often
vain
legend
not
to
be
too
invidious
of
author
or
subject
or
school
but
he
had
a
drop
no
less
as
from
the
sense
of
a
cause
sometimes
lost
ah
that
s
a
game
at
which
we
can
play
though
scarcely
lady
grace
suggested
at
which
we
all
can
the
words
appeared
indeed
to
take
meaning
from
his
growing
impression
of
the
place
and
its
charm
of
the
number
of
objects
treasures
of
art
that
pressed
for
appreciation
of
their
importance
certainly
he
said
no
one
can
ever
have
scored
much
on
sacred
spots
of
order
which
express
so
the
grand
impunity
of
their
pride
their
claims
their
assurance
we
ve
had
great
luck
she
granted
as
i
ve
just
been
reminded
but
ever
since
those
terrible
things
you
told
me
in
town
about
the
tremendous
tricks
of
the
whirligig
of
time
and
the
aesthetic
fools
paradise
in
which
so
many
of
us
live
i
ve
gone
about
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
who
knows
that
while
i
talk
bender
mayn
t
be
pulling
us
to
pieces
hugh
crimble
had
a
shudder
of
remembrance
mr
bender
the
rich
american
who
s
going
it
gave
him
a
sharper
shock
the
wretch
who
bagged
lady
lappington
s
longhi
lady
grace
showed
surprise
is
he
a
wretch
her
visitor
but
asked
to
be
extravagant
rather
the
scoundrel
he
offered
his
infernal
eight
thousand
oh
i
thought
you
meant
he
had
played
some
trick
i
wish
he
had
he
could
then
have
been
well
lady
grace
peacefully
smiled
it
s
no
use
his
offering
eight
thousand
or
eighteen
or
even
eighty
hugh
crimble
stared
as
at
the
odd
superfluity
of
this
reassurance
almost
crude
on
exquisite
lips
and
contradicting
an
imputation
no
one
would
have
indecently
made
gracious
goodness
i
hope
not
the
man
surely
doesn
t
you
d
she
might
while
she
still
smiled
at
him
have
been
fairly
enjoying
the
friendly
horror
she
produced
i
don
t
quite
know
what
he
supposes
but
people
trafficked
people
do
people
are
trafficking
all
ah
hugh
crimble
cried
that
s
what
deprives
me
of
my
rest
and
as
a
lover
of
our
vast
and
beneficent
poisons
my
waking
hours
that
is
at
the
mercy
of
a
leak
there
appears
no
means
of
she
had
tapped
a
spring
in
him
clearly
and
the
consequent
flood
might
almost
at
any
moment
become
copious
precious
things
are
going
out
of
our
distracted
country
at
a
quicker
rate
than
the
very
quickest
a
century
and
more
ago
of
their
ever
coming
she
was
sharply
struck
but
was
also
unmistakably
a
person
in
whom
stirred
thought
soon
found
connections
and
relations
well
i
suppose
our
came
in
save
for
those
awkward
elgin
marbles
mainly
by
purchase
too
didn
t
it
we
ourselves
largely
took
it
away
from
somewhere
didn
t
we
we
didn
t
it
we
grew
some
of
the
loveliest
flowers
and
on
the
whole
the
most
he
had
been
pulled
up
but
for
an
instant
great
gainsboroughs
and
sir
joshuas
and
romneys
and
sargents
great
turners
and
constables
and
old
cromes
and
brabazons
form
you
ll
recognise
a
vast
garden
in
themselves
what
have
we
ever
for
instance
more
successfully
grown
than
your
splendid
duchess
of
waterbridge
the
girl
showed
herself
ready
at
once
to
recognise
under
his
eloquence
anything
he
would
yes
it
s
our
sir
joshua
i
believe
that
bender
has
proclaimed
himself
particularly
it
brought
a
cloud
to
her
friend
s
face
then
he
ll
be
capable
of
of
anything
no
doubt
but
of
making
my
father
capable
and
you
haven
t
at
any
rate
she
said
so
much
as
seen
the
i
beg
your
pardon
i
saw
it
at
the
guildhall
three
years
ago
and
am
almost
afraid
of
getting
again
with
a
fresh
sense
of
its
beauty
a
livelier
sense
of
its
lady
grace
however
was
so
far
from
fear
that
she
could
even
afford
pity
poor
baffled
bender
oh
rich
and
confident
bender
crimble
cried
once
given
his
money
his
confidence
is
a
horrid
engine
in
itself
there
s
the
rub
i
dare
say
the
young
man
saw
it
all
he
has
brought
his
poisonous
she
gave
it
her
less
exasperated
wonder
one
has
heard
of
that
but
only
in
the
case
of
some
particularly
pushing
and
bender
to
do
him
justice
isn
t
a
particularly
pushing
dealer
no
lady
grace
judiciously
returned
i
think
he
s
not
a
dealer
at
all
but
just
what
you
a
moment
ago
spoke
of
yourself
as
he
gave
a
glance
at
his
possibly
wild
recent
past
a
fond
true
lover
as
we
were
in
our
lucky
time
when
we
italy
and
he
appeared
to
recognise
this
complication
of
bender
s
voracious
integrity
but
only
to
push
it
away
well
i
don
t
know
whether
the
best
lovers
are
or
ever
were
the
best
buyers
but
i
feel
that
they
re
the
best
the
breath
of
his
emphasis
blew
as
her
eyes
showed
on
the
girl
s
dimmer
fire
it
s
as
if
it
were
suddenly
in
the
air
that
you
ve
brought
us
some
light
or
some
help
that
you
may
do
something
really
good
for
do
you
mean
mark
down
as
they
say
at
the
shops
all
your
greatest
claims
his
chord
of
sensibility
had
trembled
all
gratefully
into
derision
and
not
to
seem
to
swagger
he
had
put
his
possible
virtue
at
its
lowest
this
she
beautifully
showed
that
she
beautifully
saw
i
dare
say
that
if
you
did
even
that
we
should
have
to
take
it
from
then
it
may
very
well
be
he
laughed
back
the
reason
why
i
feel
under
my
delightful
wonderful
impression
a
bit
anxious
and
nervous
and
that
shows
she
returned
that
you
suspect
us
of
horrors
hiding
from
justice
and
that
your
natural
kindness
yet
shrinks
from
handing
us
over
well
clearly
she
might
put
it
as
she
liked
it
all
came
back
to
his
being
more
charmed
heaven
knows
i
ve
wanted
a
chance
at
you
but
what
should
you
say
if
having
then
at
last
just
taken
you
in
in
your
so
apparent
perfection
i
should
feel
it
the
better
part
of
valour
simply
to
mount
my
bike
again
and
spin
away
i
should
be
sure
that
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
you
d
turn
right
round
and
come
back
you
d
think
again
of
whom
i
don
t
however
you
see
if
he
s
prowling
off
there
in
the
least
want
to
crimble
made
the
point
with
gaiety
i
don
t
know
what
i
mightn
t
do
to
him
and
yet
it
s
not
of
my
temptation
to
violence
after
all
that
i
m
most
afraid
it
s
of
the
brutal
mistake
of
one
s
breaking
with
one
s
priggish
precious
modernity
and
one
s
possibly
futile
discriminations
into
a
situation
or
composition
as
we
say
so
serene
and
sound
and
right
what
should
one
do
here
out
of
respect
for
that
felicity
but
hold
one
s
breath
and
walk
on
the
very
celebrations
and
consecrations
as
you
tell
me
instinctively
stay
outside
i
saw
that
all
the
young
man
went
on
with
more
weight
in
his
ardour
i
saw
it
while
we
talked
in
london
as
your
natural
setting
and
your
native
air
and
now
ten
minutes
on
the
spot
have
made
it
sink
into
my
spirit
you
re
a
case
all
together
of
enchanted
harmony
of
perfect
equilibrium
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
or
his
friend
listened
to
this
eloquence
with
her
eyes
lowered
then
raising
them
to
meet
with
a
vague
insistence
his
own
after
which
something
she
had
seen
there
appeared
to
determine
in
her
another
motion
she
indicated
the
small
landscape
that
bender
had
by
lady
sandgate
s
report
rapidly
studied
and
denounced
for
what
do
you
take
that
little
picture
hugh
crimble
went
over
and
looked
why
don
t
you
know
it
s
a
jolly
little
vandermeer
of
it
s
not
a
base
imitation
he
looked
again
but
appeared
at
a
loss
an
imitation
of
vandermeer
mr
bender
thinks
of
it
made
the
young
man
ring
out
then
bender
s
doubly
dangerous
singly
is
enough
lady
grace
laughed
but
you
see
you
to
oh
to
rather
after
that
if
you
ll
just
take
me
to
yes
then
she
said
but
even
while
she
spoke
lord
john
who
had
returned
by
the
terrace
from
his
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
with
lady
imber
was
there
practically
between
them
a
fact
that
she
had
to
notice
for
her
other
visitor
to
whom
she
was
hastily
reduced
to
naming
him
his
lordship
eagerly
made
the
most
of
this
tribute
of
her
attention
which
had
reached
his
ear
he
treated
it
her
oh
lord
john
as
a
direct
greeting
ah
lady
grace
i
came
back
particularly
to
find
she
could
but
explain
her
predicament
i
was
taking
crimble
to
see
the
and
then
more
pointedly
as
her
manner
had
been
virtually
an
introduction
of
that
gentleman
an
introduction
which
lord
john
s
mere
noncommittal
stare
was
as
little
as
possible
a
response
to
mr
crimble
s
one
of
the
quite
new
oh
i
m
at
the
very
lowest
round
of
the
ladder
but
i
aspire
hugh
laughed
you
ll
mount
said
lady
grace
with
friendly
confidence
he
took
it
again
with
gay
deprecation
ah
if
by
that
time
there
s
anything
left
here
to
mount
let
us
hope
there
will
be
at
least
what
bender
poor
man
won
t
have
been
able
to
carry
to
which
lady
grace
added
as
to
strike
a
helpful
spark
from
the
personage
who
had
just
joined
them
but
who
had
the
air
of
wishing
to
preserve
his
detachment
it
s
to
lord
john
that
we
owe
bender
s
hugh
looked
at
the
gentleman
to
whom
they
were
so
indebted
then
do
you
happen
to
know
sir
what
your
friend
means
to
with
his
spoil
the
question
got
itself
but
dryly
treated
as
if
it
might
be
a
commercially
calculating
or
interested
one
oh
not
sell
it
then
ship
it
to
new
york
the
inquirer
pursued
defining
himself
somehow
as
not
snubbed
and
from
this
point
not
snubbable
that
appearance
failed
none
the
less
to
deprive
lord
john
of
a
betrayed
relish
for
being
able
to
displease
lady
grace
s
odd
guest
by
large
assent
as
fast
as
ever
he
can
and
you
can
land
things
there
can
t
you
in
three
or
four
i
dare
say
but
can
t
he
be
induced
to
have
a
little
mercy
hugh
sturdily
pursued
lord
john
pushed
out
his
lips
a
little
how
much
do
you
want
well
one
wants
to
be
able
somehow
to
stay
his
i
doubt
if
you
can
any
more
stay
bender
s
hand
than
you
can
empty
his
ah
the
despoilers
said
crimble
with
strong
expression
but
it
s
he
added
who
are
base
and
lord
john
s
surprise
was
apparently
genuine
to
want
only
to
do
business
i
mean
with
our
treasures
with
our
hugh
s
words
exhaled
such
a
sense
of
peril
as
to
draw
at
once
lady
grace
ah
but
if
we
re
above
that
as
you
know
he
stood
smilingly
corrected
and
contrite
of
course
i
know
but
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
have
it
on
the
brain
and
show
me
first
of
all
won
t
you
the
moretto
of
you
know
then
about
the
moretto
of
brescia
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
yourself
it
went
on
between
them
for
the
moment
quite
as
if
there
had
been
no
lord
john
probably
yes
she
recalled
so
how
i
must
have
swaggered
after
which
she
turned
to
the
other
visitor
with
a
kindness
strained
clear
of
urgency
will
you
also
come
he
confessed
to
a
difficulty
which
his
whole
face
begged
her
also
to
take
account
of
i
hoped
you
d
be
at
leisure
for
something
i
ve
so
at
heart
this
had
its
effect
she
took
a
rapid
decision
and
turned
persuasively
to
crimble
for
whom
in
like
manner
there
must
have
been
something
in
face
let
bender
himself
then
show
you
and
there
are
things
in
the
library
oh
yes
there
are
things
in
the
lord
john
happy
in
his
gained
advantage
and
addressing
hugh
from
the
strong
ground
of
an
initiation
already
complete
quite
sped
him
on
the
way
hugh
clearly
made
no
attempt
to
veil
the
penetration
with
which
he
was
moved
to
look
from
one
of
these
counsellors
to
the
other
though
with
a
ready
for
lady
grace
he
the
next
instant
started
in
pursuit
of
bender
v
your
friend
seems
remarkably
hot
lord
john
remarked
to
his
young
hostess
as
soon
as
they
had
been
left
together
he
has
cycled
twenty
miles
and
indeed
she
smiled
he
does
appear
to
care
for
what
he
cares
for
her
companion
then
during
a
moment
s
silence
might
have
been
noting
the
emphasis
of
her
assent
have
you
known
him
long
no
not
nor
seen
him
often
only
once
till
oh
said
lord
john
with
another
pause
but
he
soon
proceeded
let
us
leave
him
then
to
cool
i
haven
t
cycled
twenty
miles
but
i
ve
motored
forty
very
much
in
the
hope
of
lady
grace
the
chance
of
being
able
to
assure
you
that
i
too
care
very
much
for
what
i
care
to
which
he
added
on
an
easier
note
as
to
carry
off
a
slight
awkwardness
while
she
only
waited
you
certainly
mustn
t
let
yourself
between
us
all
be
worked
to
oh
such
days
as
this
i
she
made
light
enough
of
her
burden
they
don
t
come
often
to
at
least
lady
grace
i
hadn
t
grasped
in
advance
the
scale
of
your
fête
he
went
on
but
since
i
ve
the
great
luck
to
find
you
alone
he
paused
for
breath
however
before
the
full
sequence
she
helped
him
out
as
through
common
kindness
but
it
was
a
trifle
colourless
alone
or
in
company
lord
john
i
m
always
very
glad
to
see
then
that
assurance
helps
me
to
wonder
if
you
don
t
perhaps
gently
guess
what
it
is
i
want
to
this
time
indeed
she
left
him
to
his
wonder
so
that
he
had
to
support
himself
i
ve
tried
all
considerately
these
three
months
to
let
you
see
for
yourself
how
i
feel
i
feel
very
strongly
lady
grace
so
that
at
last
and
his
impatient
sincerity
took
after
another
instant
the
jump
well
i
regularly
worship
you
you
re
my
absolute
ideal
i
think
of
you
the
whole
she
measured
out
consideration
as
if
it
had
been
a
yard
of
pretty
ribbon
are
you
sure
you
me
enough
i
think
i
know
a
perfect
woman
when
i
see
one
nothing
now
at
least
could
have
been
more
prompt
and
while
a
decent
pity
for
such
a
mistake
showed
in
her
smile
he
followed
it
up
isn
t
what
you
rather
mean
that
you
haven
t
cared
sufficiently
to
know
if
so
that
can
be
little
by
little
mended
lady
he
was
in
fact
altogether
gallant
about
it
i
m
aware
of
the
limits
of
what
i
have
to
show
or
to
offer
but
i
defy
you
to
find
a
limit
to
my
possible
she
deferred
to
that
but
taking
it
in
a
lower
key
i
believe
you
d
be
very
good
to
well
isn
t
something
to
start
with
he
fairly
pounced
on
it
i
ll
do
any
blest
thing
in
life
you
like
i
ll
accept
any
condition
you
impose
if
you
ll
only
tell
me
you
see
your
shouldn
t
i
have
a
little
more
first
to
see
yours
she
asked
when
you
say
you
ll
do
anything
in
life
i
like
isn
t
there
anything
you
yourself
want
strongly
enough
to
do
he
cast
a
stare
about
on
the
suggestions
of
the
scene
anything
that
will
make
money
you
mean
make
money
or
make
reputation
or
even
just
make
the
time
oh
what
i
have
to
look
to
in
the
way
of
a
career
if
that
was
her
meaning
he
could
show
after
an
instant
that
he
didn
t
fear
it
well
your
father
dear
delightful
man
has
been
so
good
as
to
give
me
to
understand
that
he
backs
me
for
a
decent
deserving
creature
and
i
ve
noticed
as
you
doubtless
yourself
have
that
when
lord
theign
backs
a
fellow
he
left
the
obvious
moral
for
her
to
take
up
which
she
did
but
all
interrogatively
the
fellow
at
once
comes
in
for
something
awfully
good
i
don
t
in
the
least
mind
your
laughing
at
me
lord
john
returned
for
when
i
put
him
the
question
of
the
lift
he
d
give
me
by
speaking
to
you
first
he
bade
me
simply
remember
the
complete
personal
liberty
in
which
he
leaves
you
and
yet
which
doesn
t
come
take
my
word
said
the
young
man
sagely
from
his
being
at
all
no
she
answered
father
isn
t
indifferent
but
father
s
great
great
indeed
her
friend
took
it
as
with
full
comprehension
this
appeared
not
to
prevent
however
a
second
and
more
anxious
thought
too
great
for
well
he
makes
me
feel
even
as
his
daughter
my
extreme
comparative
it
was
easy
lord
john
indicated
to
see
what
she
meant
he
s
a
and
a
serious
one
that
s
what
he
is
the
very
type
and
model
of
it
down
to
the
ground
so
you
can
imagine
the
young
man
said
what
he
makes
me
feel
most
of
all
when
he
s
so
awfully
to
me
his
being
as
great
as
you
say
and
yet
backing
me
such
as
i
am
doesn
t
strike
you
as
a
good
note
for
me
the
best
you
could
possibly
require
for
he
really
like
what
i
propose
to
she
might
have
been
noting
while
she
thought
that
he
had
risen
to
ingenuity
to
fineness
on
the
wings
of
his
argument
under
the
effect
of
which
her
reply
had
the
air
of
a
concession
yes
he
would
like
then
he
spoken
to
you
her
suitor
eagerly
asked
he
hasn
t
needed
he
has
ways
of
letting
one
yes
yes
he
has
ways
all
his
own
like
everything
else
he
has
he
s
she
fully
agreed
he
s
the
tone
of
it
appeared
somehow
to
shorten
at
once
for
lord
john
the
rest
of
his
approach
to
a
conclusion
so
you
do
see
your
way
ah
she
said
with
a
quick
sad
shrinkage
i
mean
her
visitor
hastened
to
explain
if
he
does
put
it
to
you
as
the
very
best
idea
he
has
for
you
when
he
does
that
as
i
believe
him
ready
to
do
will
you
really
and
fairly
listen
to
him
i
m
certain
honestly
that
when
you
know
me
better
his
confidence
in
short
donned
a
bravery
i
ve
been
feeling
this
quarter
of
an
hour
the
girl
returned
that
i
do
know
you
then
isn
t
that
all
i
want
unless
indeed
i
ought
perhaps
to
ask
rather
if
it
isn
t
all
do
at
any
rate
said
lord
john
i
may
see
you
again
here
she
waited
a
moment
you
must
have
patience
with
i
having
it
but
your
father
s
well
she
said
that
must
come
then
you
won
t
dodge
it
she
looked
at
him
straight
i
don
t
dodge
lord
he
admired
the
manner
of
it
you
look
awfully
handsome
as
you
say
so
and
you
see
what
does
to
as
to
attentuate
a
little
the
freedom
of
which
he
went
on
may
i
fondly
hope
that
if
lady
imber
too
should
wish
to
put
in
another
word
for
me
will
i
listen
to
her
it
brought
lady
grace
straight
down
no
lord
john
let
me
tell
you
at
once
that
i
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
kitty
s
quite
another
affair
and
i
never
listen
to
her
a
bit
more
than
i
can
lord
john
appeared
to
feel
on
this
that
he
mustn
t
too
easily
in
honour
abandon
a
person
who
had
presented
herself
to
him
as
an
ally
ah
you
strike
me
as
a
little
hard
on
her
your
father
himself
in
his
looser
moments
takes
pleasure
in
what
she
our
young
woman
s
eyes
as
they
rested
on
him
after
this
remark
had
no
mercy
for
its
extreme
feebleness
if
you
mean
that
she
s
the
most
reckless
rattle
one
knows
and
that
she
never
looks
so
beautiful
as
when
she
s
at
her
worst
and
that
always
clever
for
where
she
makes
out
her
interest
she
has
learnt
to
get
round
him
till
he
only
sees
through
her
eyes
if
you
mean
i
understand
you
perfectly
but
even
if
you
think
me
horrid
for
reflecting
so
on
my
nearest
and
dearest
it
s
not
on
the
side
on
which
he
has
most
confidence
in
his
elder
daughter
that
his
youngest
is
moved
to
have
most
confidence
in
lord
john
stared
as
if
she
had
shaken
some
odd
bright
fluttering
object
in
his
face
but
then
recovering
himself
he
hasn
t
perhaps
an
absolutely
boundless
confidence
in
any
one
in
the
world
but
himself
she
had
taken
him
straight
up
he
hasn
t
indeed
and
that
s
what
we
must
come
to
so
that
even
if
he
likes
you
as
much
as
you
doubtless
very
justly
feel
it
won
t
be
because
you
are
right
about
your
being
nice
but
because
is
you
mean
that
if
i
were
wrong
about
it
he
would
still
insist
that
he
isn
t
lady
grace
was
indeed
sure
absolutely
if
he
had
begun
so
he
began
so
with
kitty
that
is
with
allowing
her
lord
john
appeared
struck
yes
and
he
still
allows
her
two
i
m
glad
to
hear
it
she
has
never
told
me
how
much
the
girl
undisguisedly
smiled
then
perhaps
i
oughtn
t
he
glowed
with
the
light
of
contrition
well
you
can
t
help
it
now
his
companion
remarked
with
amusement
you
mean
that
he
ought
to
allow
as
much
lord
john
inquired
i
m
sure
you
re
right
and
that
he
will
he
continued
quite
as
in
good
faith
but
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
don
t
care
in
the
least
what
it
may
be
the
subject
of
his
suit
took
the
longest
look
at
him
she
had
taken
yet
you
re
very
good
to
say
so
if
this
was
ironic
the
touch
fell
short
thanks
to
his
perception
that
they
had
practically
just
ceased
to
be
alone
they
were
in
presence
of
a
third
figure
who
had
arrived
from
the
terrace
but
whose
approach
to
them
was
not
so
immediate
as
to
deprive
lord
john
of
time
for
another
question
will
you
let
tell
you
at
all
events
how
good
he
thinks
me
and
then
let
me
come
back
and
have
it
from
you
again
lady
grace
s
answer
to
this
was
to
turn
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
person
by
whom
they
were
now
joined
lord
john
desires
you
should
tell
me
father
how
good
you
think
good
my
dear
good
for
what
said
lord
theign
a
trifle
absurdly
but
looking
from
one
of
them
to
the
other
i
feel
i
must
ask
to
tell
then
i
shall
give
him
a
chance
as
i
should
particularly
like
you
to
go
back
and
deal
with
those
overwhelming
ah
they
don
t
overwhelm
father
the
girl
put
it
with
some
point
if
you
mean
to
say
i
overwhelmed
i
dare
say
i
did
he
replied
from
my
view
of
that
vast
collective
gape
of
six
hundred
painfully
plain
and
perfectly
expressionless
faces
but
that
was
only
for
the
time
i
pumped
advice
oh
advice
and
they
held
the
large
bucket
as
still
as
my
pet
pointer
when
i
scratch
him
holds
his
back
the
bucket
under
the
stream
was
bound
to
overflow
lady
grace
suggested
well
the
strong
recoil
of
the
wave
of
intelligence
has
been
not
unnaturally
followed
by
the
formidable
break
you
must
really
lord
theign
insisted
go
and
deal
with
his
daughter
s
smile
for
all
this
was
perceptibly
cold
you
work
people
up
father
and
then
leave
others
to
let
them
the
two
things
he
promptly
replied
require
different
to
which
he
simply
added
as
with
the
habit
of
authority
though
not
of
harshness
go
it
was
absolute
and
she
yielded
only
pausing
an
instant
to
look
as
with
a
certain
gathered
meaning
from
one
of
the
men
to
the
other
faintly
and
resignedly
sighing
she
passed
away
to
the
terrace
and
disappeared
the
nature
that
let
you
down
i
rather
like
it
you
know
lord
john
threw
off
which
for
an
airy
elegance
in
them
were
perhaps
just
slightly
rash
words
his
companion
gave
him
so
sharp
a
look
as
the
two
were
left
together
vi
face
to
face
with
his
visitor
the
master
of
dedborough
betrayed
the
impression
his
daughter
appeared
to
have
given
him
she
didn
t
want
to
go
and
then
before
lord
john
could
reply
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
her
lord
john
took
his
time
i
think
perhaps
a
little
and
who
the
deuce
is
a
little
crimble
a
young
man
who
was
just
with
her
and
whom
she
appears
to
have
where
is
he
then
lord
theign
demanded
off
there
among
the
pictures
which
he
seems
partly
to
have
come
oh
it
made
his
lordship
easier
then
he
s
all
right
on
such
a
his
companion
could
none
the
less
just
wonder
hadn
t
lady
grace
told
you
that
he
was
coming
not
that
i
but
lord
theign
perceptibly
preoccupied
made
nothing
of
this
we
ve
had
other
fish
to
fry
and
you
know
the
freedom
i
allow
his
friend
had
a
vivid
gesture
my
dear
man
i
only
ask
to
profit
by
it
with
which
there
might
well
have
been
in
lord
john
s
face
a
light
of
comment
on
the
pretension
in
such
a
quarter
to
allow
freedom
yet
it
was
a
pretension
that
lord
theign
sustained
as
to
show
himself
far
from
all
bourgeois
narrowness
she
has
her
friends
by
the
score
at
this
time
of
there
was
clearly
a
claim
here
also
to
the
time
of
day
but
in
the
matter
of
friends
where
by
the
way
is
your
own
of
whom
i
ve
but
just
heard
oh
off
there
among
the
pictures
too
so
they
ll
have
met
and
taken
care
of
each
accounting
for
this
inquirer
would
be
clearly
the
least
of
lord
john
s
difficulties
i
mustn
t
appear
to
bender
to
have
failed
him
but
i
must
at
once
let
you
know
before
i
join
him
that
seizing
my
opportunity
i
have
just
very
definitely
in
fact
very
pressingly
spoken
to
lady
grace
it
hasn
t
been
perhaps
he
continued
quite
the
pick
of
a
chance
but
that
seemed
never
to
come
and
if
i
m
not
too
fondly
mistaken
at
any
rate
she
listened
to
me
without
abhorrence
only
i
ve
led
her
to
expect
for
our
case
that
you
ll
be
so
good
without
loss
of
time
as
to
say
the
clinching
word
to
her
without
loss
you
mean
of
a
my
daughter
s
time
lord
theign
confessedly
and
amiably
interested
had
accepted
these
intimations
yet
with
the
very
blandness
that
was
not
accessible
to
hustling
and
was
never
forgetful
of
its
standing
privilege
of
criticism
he
had
come
in
from
his
public
duty
a
few
minutes
before
somewhat
flushed
and
blown
but
that
had
presently
dropped
to
the
effect
we
should
have
guessed
of
his
appearing
to
lord
john
at
least
as
cool
as
the
occasion
required
his
appearance
we
ourselves
certainly
should
have
felt
was
in
all
respects
charming
with
the
great
note
of
it
the
beautiful
restless
almost
suspicious
challenge
to
you
on
the
part
of
deep
and
mixed
things
in
him
his
pride
and
his
shyness
his
conscience
his
taste
and
his
temper
to
deny
that
he
was
admirably
simple
obviously
at
this
rate
he
had
a
passion
for
simplicity
simplicity
above
all
of
relation
with
you
and
would
show
you
with
the
last
subtlety
of
displeasure
his
impatience
of
your
attempting
anything
more
with
himself
with
such
an
ideal
of
decent
ease
he
would
confound
you
sink
a
hundred
other
attributes
or
the
recognition
at
least
and
the
formulation
of
them
that
you
might
abjectly
have
taken
for
granted
in
him
just
to
show
you
that
in
a
beastly
vulgar
age
you
had
and
small
wonder
a
beastly
vulgar
imagination
he
sank
thus
surely
in
defiance
of
insistent
vulgarity
half
his
consciousness
of
his
advantages
flattering
himself
that
mere
facility
and
amiability
a
true
effective
a
positively
ideal
suppression
of
reference
in
any
one
to
anything
that
might
complicate
alone
floated
above
this
would
be
quite
his
religion
you
might
infer
to
cause
his
hands
to
ignore
in
whatever
contact
any
opportunity
however
convenient
for
an
unfair
pull
which
habit
it
was
that
must
have
produced
in
him
a
sort
of
ripe
and
radiant
fairness
if
it
be
allowed
us
that
is
to
figure
in
so
shining
an
air
a
nobleman
of
of
an
undecided
rather
than
a
certified
frame
or
outline
of
a
head
thinly
though
neatly
covered
and
not
measureably
massive
of
an
almost
trivial
freshness
of
a
face
marked
but
by
a
fine
inwrought
line
or
two
and
lighted
by
a
merely
charming
expression
you
might
somehow
have
traced
back
the
whole
character
so
presented
to
an
ideal
privately
invoked
that
of
his
establishing
in
the
formal
garden
of
his
suffered
greatness
such
easy
seats
and
short
perspectives
such
winding
paths
and
waters
as
would
mercifully
break
up
the
scale
you
would
perhaps
indeed
have
reflected
at
the
same
time
that
the
thought
of
so
much
mercy
was
almost
more
than
anything
else
the
thought
of
a
great
option
and
a
great
margin
in
fine
of
fifty
alternatives
which
remarks
of
ours
however
leave
his
lordship
with
his
last
immediate
question
on
his
hands
well
yes
of
course
in
all
propriety
his
companion
has
meanwhile
replied
to
it
but
i
was
thinking
a
little
you
understand
of
the
importance
of
our
own
divinably
lord
theign
put
himself
out
less
as
we
may
say
for
the
comparatively
haunters
of
his
garden
than
for
interlopers
even
but
slightly
accredited
he
seemed
thus
not
at
all
to
strain
to
understand
in
this
particular
connection
it
would
be
his
familiarly
amusing
friend
lord
john
clearly
who
must
do
most
of
the
work
for
him
our
own
in
the
sense
of
yours
and
mine
of
yours
and
mine
and
lady
imber
s
yes
and
a
good
bit
last
not
least
in
that
of
my
watching
and
waiting
mother
this
struck
no
prompt
spark
of
apprehension
from
his
listener
so
that
lord
john
went
on
the
last
thing
she
did
this
morning
was
to
remind
me
with
her
fine
old
frankness
that
she
would
like
to
learn
without
more
delay
where
on
the
whole
question
she
don
t
you
know
what
she
put
to
me
the
younger
man
felt
his
ground
a
little
but
proceeded
further
what
she
put
to
me
with
her
rather
grand
way
of
looking
questions
straight
in
the
face
you
see
was
do
we
or
don
t
we
decidedly
take
up
practically
her
very
handsome
offer
very
handsome
being
i
mean
what
calls
it
though
it
strikes
even
me
too
you
know
as
rather
lord
theign
at
this
point
resigned
himself
to
know
kitty
has
of
course
rubbed
into
me
how
decent
she
herself
finds
it
she
hurls
herself
again
on
me
successfully
for
everything
and
it
suits
her
down
to
the
ground
she
pays
her
beastly
debt
that
is
i
mean
to
say
and
he
took
himself
up
though
it
was
scarce
more
than
perfunctory
discharges
her
obligations
by
her
sister
s
fair
hand
not
to
mention
a
few
other
trifles
for
which
i
naturally
lord
john
a
little
unexpectedly
to
himself
on
the
defensive
was
yet
but
briefly
at
a
loss
of
course
we
take
into
account
don
t
we
not
only
the
fact
of
my
mother
s
desire
intended
i
assure
you
to
be
most
flattering
that
lady
grace
shall
enter
our
family
with
all
honours
but
her
expressed
readiness
to
facilitate
the
thing
by
an
understanding
over
and
above
over
and
above
kitty
s
release
from
her
damnable
payment
lord
theign
reached
out
to
what
his
guest
had
left
rather
in
the
air
of
course
we
take
into
account
or
i
shouldn
t
my
dear
fellow
be
discussing
with
you
at
all
a
business
one
or
two
of
whose
aspects
so
little
appeal
to
me
especially
as
there
s
nothing
you
easily
conceive
that
a
daughter
of
mine
can
come
in
for
by
entering
even
your
family
or
any
other
as
a
family
that
she
wouldn
t
be
quite
as
sure
of
by
just
staying
in
her
own
the
duchess
s
idea
at
any
rate
if
i
ve
followed
you
is
that
if
grace
does
accept
you
she
settles
on
you
twelve
thousand
with
the
condition
lord
john
was
already
all
there
definitely
yes
of
your
settling
the
equivalent
on
lady
and
what
do
you
call
the
equivalent
of
twelve
thousand
why
tacked
on
to
a
value
so
great
and
so
charming
as
lady
grace
herself
i
dare
say
such
a
sum
as
nine
or
ten
would
and
where
the
mischief
if
you
please
at
this
highly
inconvenient
time
am
i
to
pick
up
nine
or
ten
thousand
lord
john
declined
with
a
smiling
a
fairly
irritating
eye
for
his
friend
s
general
resources
to
consider
that
question
seriously
surely
you
can
have
no
difficulty
whatever
why
not
when
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
i
ve
had
this
year
to
let
poor
dear
old
hill
street
do
you
call
it
the
moment
for
me
to
have
to
see
myself
all
but
cajoled
into
planking
down
even
such
a
matter
as
the
very
much
lower
figure
of
kitty
s
horrid
incubus
ah
but
the
inducement
and
the
pro
lord
john
brightly
indicated
are
here
much
greater
in
the
case
you
speak
of
you
will
only
have
removed
the
incubus
which
i
grant
you
she
must
and
you
must
feel
as
horrid
in
this
other
you
pacify
lady
imber
marry
lady
grace
marry
her
to
a
man
who
has
set
his
heart
on
her
and
of
whom
she
has
just
expressed
to
himself
a
very
kind
and
very
high
she
has
expressed
a
very
high
opinion
of
you
lord
theign
scarce
glowed
with
credulity
but
the
younger
man
held
his
ground
she
has
told
me
she
thoroughly
likes
me
and
that
though
a
fellow
feels
an
ass
repeating
such
things
she
thinks
me
perfectly
a
tremendous
creature
eh
all
round
then
said
lord
theign
what
does
she
want
more
she
very
possibly
wants
nothing
but
i
m
to
that
beastly
degree
you
see
his
visitor
patiently
explained
in
the
cleft
stick
of
my
fearfully
positive
mother
s
wants
those
are
her
terms
and
i
don
t
mind
saying
that
they
re
most
disagreeable
to
me
i
quite
hate
em
there
only
i
think
it
makes
a
jolly
difference
that
i
wouldn
t
touch
em
with
a
long
pole
if
my
personal
feeling
in
respect
to
lady
grace
wasn
t
so
immensely
i
assure
you
i
d
chuck
em
out
of
window
my
boy
if
i
didn
t
believe
you
d
be
really
good
to
her
lord
theign
returned
with
the
properest
spirit
it
only
encouraged
his
companion
you
just
tell
her
then
now
and
here
how
good
you
honestly
believe
i
shall
be
this
appeal
required
a
moment
a
longer
look
at
him
you
truly
hold
that
that
friendly
guarantee
backed
by
my
parental
weight
will
do
your
job
that
s
the
conviction
i
lord
theign
thought
again
well
even
if
your
conviction
s
just
that
still
doesn
t
tell
me
into
which
of
my
very
empty
pockets
it
will
be
of
the
least
use
for
me
to
oh
lord
john
laughed
when
a
man
has
such
a
tremendous
assortment
of
breeches
he
pulled
up
however
as
in
his
motion
his
eye
caught
the
great
vista
of
the
open
rooms
if
it
s
a
question
of
pockets
and
what
s
em
here
precisely
is
my
man
this
personage
had
come
back
from
his
tour
of
observation
and
was
now
on
the
threshold
of
the
hall
exhibited
to
lord
theign
as
well
lord
john
s
welcome
was
warm
i
ve
had
awfully
to
fail
you
bender
but
i
was
on
the
point
of
joining
you
let
me
however
still
better
introduce
you
to
our
vii
bender
indeed
formidably
advancing
scarce
had
use
for
this
assistance
happy
to
meet
you
especially
in
your
beautiful
home
lord
to
which
he
added
while
the
master
of
dedborough
stood
passive
to
his
approach
i
ve
been
round
by
your
kind
permission
and
the
light
of
nature
and
haven
t
required
support
though
if
i
had
there
s
a
gentleman
there
who
seemed
prepared
to
allow
me
any
bender
out
of
his
abundance
evoked
as
by
a
suggestive
hand
this
contributory
figure
a
young
spare
nervous
gentleman
with
i
guess
he
s
an
author
a
friend
of
yours
too
he
asked
of
lord
john
the
answer
was
prompt
and
emphatic
no
the
gentleman
is
no
friend
at
all
of
mine
a
friend
of
my
daughter
s
lord
theign
easily
explained
i
hope
they
re
looking
after
oh
they
took
care
he
had
tea
and
bread
and
butter
to
any
extent
and
were
so
good
as
to
move
something
bender
conscientiously
added
so
that
he
could
get
up
on
a
chair
and
see
straight
into
the
this
was
a
touch
however
that
appeared
to
affect
lord
john
unfavourably
up
on
a
chair
i
say
bender
took
another
view
why
i
got
right
up
myself
a
little
more
and
i
d
almost
have
begun
to
paw
it
he
got
me
quite
interested
the
proprietor
of
the
picture
would
perhaps
care
to
know
in
that
and
it
was
on
these
lines
that
bender
continued
to
advance
i
take
it
that
your
biggest
value
however
lord
theign
is
your
splendid
sir
joshua
our
friend
there
has
a
great
deal
to
say
about
that
too
but
it
didn
t
lead
to
our
moving
any
more
on
which
he
paused
as
to
enjoy
with
a
show
of
his
fine
teeth
his
host
s
reassurance
it
yet
my
impression
of
that
picture
sir
led
to
something
else
are
you
prepared
lord
theign
to
entertain
a
proposition
lord
theign
met
bender
s
eyes
while
this
inquirer
left
these
few
portentous
words
to
speak
for
themselves
to
the
effect
that
i
part
to
you
with
the
beautiful
duchess
of
waterbridge
no
bender
such
a
proposition
would
leave
me
intensely
lord
john
had
meanwhile
had
a
more
headlong
cry
my
dear
bender
i
you
i
guess
you
don
t
envy
me
his
friend
serenely
replied
as
much
as
i
envy
lord
and
then
while
bender
and
the
latter
continued
to
face
each
other
searchingly
and
firmly
what
i
allude
to
is
an
overture
of
a
strong
and
simple
stamp
such
as
perhaps
would
shed
a
softer
light
on
the
difficulties
raised
by
association
and
attachment
i
ve
had
some
experience
of
first
shocks
and
i
d
be
glad
to
meet
you
as
man
to
bender
was
quite
clearly
all
genial
and
all
sincere
he
intended
no
irony
and
used
consciously
no
great
freedom
lord
theign
not
less
evidently
saw
this
and
it
permitted
him
amusement
as
rich
man
to
poor
man
is
how
i
m
to
understand
it
for
me
to
meet
he
added
i
should
have
to
be
tempted
and
i
m
not
even
temptable
so
there
we
are
he
blandly
smiled
his
blandness
appeared
even
for
a
moment
to
set
an
example
to
lord
john
the
beautiful
duchess
of
waterbridge
bender
is
a
golden
apple
of
one
of
those
great
family
trees
of
which
respectable
people
don
t
lop
off
the
branches
whose
venerable
shade
in
this
garish
and
denuded
age
they
so
much
bender
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
cut
some
irrelevant
caper
then
if
they
don
t
sell
their
ancestors
where
in
the
world
are
all
the
ancestors
bought
doesn
t
it
for
the
moment
sufficiently
answer
your
question
lord
theign
asked
that
they
re
definitely
not
bought
at
dedborough
why
said
bender
with
a
wealthy
patience
you
talk
as
if
it
were
my
interest
to
be
which
shows
how
little
you
understand
i
d
be
ashamed
with
the
lovely
ideas
i
have
if
i
didn
t
make
you
and
his
sturdy
smile
for
it
all
fairly
proclaimed
his
faith
well
i
guess
i
can
wait
this
again
in
turn
visibly
affected
lord
john
marking
the
moment
from
which
he
in
spite
of
his
cultivated
levity
allowed
an
intenser
and
more
sustained
look
to
keep
straying
toward
their
host
mr
bender
s
bound
to
something
it
was
even
as
if
after
a
minute
lord
theign
had
been
reached
by
his
friend
s
mute
pressure
something
something
bender
lord
john
insisted
it
made
their
visitor
rather
sharply
fix
him
why
have
an
interest
lord
john
this
personage
though
undisturbed
by
the
challenge
if
such
it
was
referred
it
to
lord
theign
do
you
authorise
me
to
speak
a
little
as
if
i
have
an
interest
lord
theign
gave
the
appeal
and
the
speaker
a
certain
attention
and
then
appeared
rather
sharply
to
turn
away
from
them
my
dear
fellow
you
may
amuse
yourself
at
my
expense
as
you
like
oh
i
don
t
mean
at
your
expense
lord
john
laughed
i
mean
at
bender
s
well
go
ahead
lord
john
said
that
gentleman
always
easy
but
always
too
as
you
would
have
felt
aware
of
everything
go
ahead
but
don
t
sweetly
hope
to
create
me
in
any
desire
that
doesn
t
already
exist
in
the
germ
the
attempt
has
often
been
made
over
here
has
in
fact
been
organised
on
a
considerable
scale
but
i
guess
i
ve
got
some
peculiarity
for
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
the
thing
could
be
done
if
the
germ
is
there
on
the
other
hand
bender
conceded
it
develops
independently
of
all
lord
john
communicated
again
as
in
a
particular
sense
with
lord
theign
he
thinks
i
really
mean
to
him
something
lord
theign
who
seemed
to
wish
to
advertise
a
degree
of
detachment
from
the
issue
or
from
any
other
such
strolled
off
in
his
restlessness
toward
the
door
that
opened
to
the
terrace
only
stopping
on
his
way
to
light
a
cigarette
from
a
matchbox
on
a
small
table
it
was
but
after
doing
so
that
he
made
the
remark
ah
bender
may
easily
be
too
much
for
you
that
makes
me
the
more
sorry
sir
said
his
visitor
not
to
have
been
enough
for
i
risk
it
at
any
rate
lord
john
went
on
i
put
you
bender
the
question
of
whether
you
wouldn
t
move
as
you
say
to
acquire
that
bender
s
large
face
had
a
commensurate
gaze
as
i
say
i
haven
t
said
anything
of
the
sort
but
you
do
love
you
know
lord
john
slightly
overgrimaced
i
don
t
when
i
don
t
want
to
i
m
different
from
most
people
i
can
love
or
not
as
i
like
the
trouble
with
that
moretto
bender
continued
is
that
it
ain
t
what
i
m
his
after
had
somehow
for
the
ear
the
vividness
of
a
sharp
whack
on
the
resisting
surface
of
things
and
was
concerned
doubtless
in
lord
john
s
speaking
again
across
to
their
host
the
worst
he
can
do
for
me
you
see
is
to
refuse
lord
theign
who
practically
had
his
back
turned
and
was
fairly
dandling
about
in
his
impatience
tossed
out
to
the
terrace
the
cigarette
he
had
but
just
lighted
yet
he
faced
round
to
reply
it
s
the
very
first
time
in
the
history
of
this
house
a
long
one
bender
that
a
picture
or
anything
else
in
it
has
been
offered
it
was
not
imperceptible
that
even
if
he
hadn
t
dropped
bender
mightn
t
have
been
markedly
impressed
then
it
must
be
the
very
first
time
such
an
offer
has
oh
it
isn
t
that
we
in
the
least
press
it
lord
theign
quite
naturally
laughed
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
i
press
it
very
hard
and
lord
john
as
taking
from
his
face
and
manner
a
cue
for
further
humorous
license
went
so
far
as
to
emulate
though
sympathetically
enough
their
companion
s
native
form
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
don
t
feel
the
interest
of
that
moretto
bender
quietly
confident
took
his
time
to
reply
well
if
you
had
seen
me
up
on
that
chair
you
d
have
thought
i
then
you
must
have
stepped
down
from
the
chair
properly
i
stepped
down
quite
impressed
with
that
young
mr
crimble
it
came
after
an
instant
to
lord
john
with
opinion
really
then
i
hope
he
s
aware
of
the
picture
s
you
had
better
ask
him
bender
observed
oh
we
don
t
depend
here
on
the
crimbles
lord
john
returned
bender
took
a
longer
look
at
him
are
you
aware
of
the
value
yourself
his
friend
resorted
again
as
for
the
amusement
of
the
thing
to
their
entertainer
am
i
aware
of
the
value
of
the
moretto
lord
theign
who
had
meanwhile
lighted
another
cigarette
appeared
a
bit
extravagantly
smoking
to
wish
to
put
an
end
to
his
effect
of
hovering
aloof
that
question
needn
t
trouble
us
when
i
see
how
much
bender
himself
knows
about
well
lord
theign
i
only
know
what
that
young
man
puts
it
and
then
as
the
others
waited
ten
thousand
said
bender
ten
thousand
the
owner
of
the
work
showed
no
emotion
well
said
lord
john
again
in
bender
s
style
what
s
the
matter
with
ten
thousand
the
subject
of
his
gay
tribute
considered
there
s
nothing
the
matter
with
ten
then
lord
theign
asked
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
the
picture
yes
sir
i
guess
there
it
gave
an
upward
push
to
his
lordship
s
eyebrows
but
what
in
the
world
well
that
s
just
the
question
the
eyebrows
continued
to
rise
does
he
pretend
there
s
a
question
of
whether
it
a
moretto
that
s
what
he
was
up
there
trying
to
find
but
if
the
value
s
according
to
himself
ten
thousand
why
of
course
said
bender
it
s
a
fine
work
then
lord
theign
brought
out
what
s
the
matter
with
bender
that
gentleman
was
perfectly
clear
the
matter
with
me
lord
theign
is
that
i
ve
no
use
for
a
ten
thousand
no
use
the
expression
had
an
oddity
but
what
s
it
your
idea
to
do
with
such
things
i
mean
bender
explained
that
a
picture
of
that
rank
is
not
what
i
m
the
figure
said
his
noble
host
speaking
thus
under
pressure
commercially
is
beyond
what
you
see
your
way
to
but
lord
john
had
jumped
at
the
truth
the
matter
with
bender
is
that
he
sees
his
way
much
further
their
companion
echoed
the
matter
with
bender
is
that
he
wants
to
give
lord
theign
sounded
this
abyss
with
a
smile
well
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
i
think
ah
said
his
guest
you
know
the
basis
sir
on
which
i
m
ready
to
on
the
basis
then
of
the
sir
joshua
lord
john
inquired
how
far
would
you
go
bender
indicated
by
a
gesture
that
on
a
question
reduced
to
a
moiety
by
its
conditional
form
he
could
give
but
well
i
d
go
all
the
he
wants
you
see
lord
john
elucidated
an
expensive
lord
theign
appeared
to
decide
after
a
moment
to
enter
into
the
pleasant
spirit
of
this
which
he
did
by
addressing
his
younger
friend
then
why
shouldn
t
i
make
even
the
moretto
as
expensive
as
he
desires
because
you
can
t
do
violence
to
master
s
natural
modesty
bender
declared
before
lord
john
had
time
to
speak
and
conscious
at
this
moment
of
the
reappearance
of
his
he
at
once
supplied
a
further
light
i
guess
this
gentleman
at
any
rate
can
tell
viii
hugh
crimble
had
come
back
from
his
voyage
of
discovery
and
it
was
visible
as
he
stood
there
flushed
and
quite
radiant
that
he
had
caught
in
his
approach
lord
theign
s
last
inquiry
and
bender
s
reply
to
it
you
would
have
imputed
to
him
on
the
spot
the
lively
possession
of
a
new
idea
the
sustaining
sense
of
a
message
important
enough
to
justify
his
irruption
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
three
men
scattered
a
little
by
the
sight
of
him
but
attached
eyes
of
recognition
then
to
lord
theign
s
whom
he
remained
an
instant
longer
communicatively
smiling
at
after
which
as
you
might
have
gathered
he
all
confidently
plunged
taking
up
the
talk
where
the
others
had
left
it
i
should
say
lord
theign
if
you
ll
allow
me
in
regard
to
what
you
appear
to
have
been
discussing
that
it
depends
a
good
deal
on
just
that
question
of
what
your
moretto
at
any
rate
may
be
presumed
or
proved
to
let
me
thank
you
he
cheerfully
went
on
for
your
kind
leave
to
go
over
your
the
personage
he
so
addressed
was
as
we
know
nothing
if
not
generally
affable
yet
if
that
was
just
then
apparent
it
was
through
a
shade
of
coolness
for
the
slightly
heated
familiarity
of
so
plain
or
at
least
so
free
a
young
man
in
now
for
the
first
time
definitely
apprehended
oh
i
ve
scarcely
treasures
but
i
ve
some
things
of
hugh
however
entering
the
opulent
circle
as
it
were
clearly
took
account
of
no
breath
of
a
chill
i
think
possible
my
lord
that
you
ve
a
great
treasure
if
you
ve
really
so
high
a
rarity
as
a
splendid
a
mantovano
you
wouldn
t
have
been
sure
that
his
lordship
didn
t
pronounce
the
word
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
there
have
been
supposed
to
be
only
real
examples
about
the
world
so
that
if
by
an
extraordinary
chance
you
find
yourself
the
possessor
of
a
magnificent
eighth
but
lord
john
had
already
broken
in
why
there
you
bender
oh
bender
with
whom
i
ve
made
acquaintance
hugh
returned
was
there
as
it
began
to
work
in
me
that
your
moretto
lord
theign
bender
took
their
informant
up
isn
t
after
all
a
moretto
at
and
he
continued
amusedly
to
hugh
it
began
to
work
in
you
sir
like
very
strong
drink
do
i
understand
you
to
suggest
lord
theign
asked
of
the
startling
young
man
that
my
precious
picture
isn
t
genuine
well
hugh
knew
exactly
what
he
suggested
as
a
picture
lord
theign
as
a
great
portrait
one
of
the
most
genuine
things
in
europe
but
it
strikes
me
as
probable
that
from
far
back
for
reasons
there
has
been
a
wrong
attribution
that
the
work
has
been
in
other
words
traditionally
obstinately
miscalled
it
has
passed
for
a
moretto
and
at
first
i
quite
took
it
for
one
but
i
suddenly
as
i
looked
and
looked
and
saw
and
saw
began
to
doubt
and
now
i
know
i
lord
theign
had
during
this
speech
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
but
he
raised
them
to
crimble
s
almost
palpitating
presence
for
the
remark
i
m
bound
to
say
that
i
hope
you
ve
some
very
good
grounds
i
ve
three
or
four
lord
theign
they
seem
to
me
of
the
best
as
yet
they
made
me
wonder
and
wonder
and
then
light
splendidly
his
lordship
didn
t
stint
his
attention
reflected
you
mean
from
mantovanos
that
i
don
t
know
i
mean
from
those
i
know
myself
said
hugh
and
i
mean
from
fine
analogies
with
one
in
analogies
that
in
all
these
years
these
centuries
have
so
remarkably
not
been
noticed
well
hugh
competently
explained
they
re
a
sort
of
thing
the
very
sense
of
the
value
and
meaning
of
are
a
highly
modern
in
fact
a
quite
recent
lord
john
at
this
professed
with
cordiality
that
he
at
least
quite
understood
oh
we
know
a
lot
more
about
our
pictures
and
things
than
ever
our
ancestors
did
well
i
guess
it
s
enough
for
bender
contributed
that
your
ancestors
knew
enough
to
get
em
ah
that
doesn
t
go
so
far
cried
hugh
unless
we
ourselves
know
enough
to
keep
em
the
words
appeared
to
quicken
in
a
manner
lord
theign
s
view
of
the
speaker
were
ancestors
crimble
great
collectors
arrested
it
might
be
in
his
general
assurance
hugh
wondered
and
smiled
mine
collectors
oh
i
m
afraid
i
haven
t
any
to
speak
of
only
it
has
seemed
to
me
for
a
long
time
he
added
that
on
that
head
we
should
all
feel
lord
theign
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
these
were
rather
large
presumptions
then
he
put
them
in
their
place
a
little
curtly
it
s
one
thing
to
keep
our
possessions
for
ourselves
it
s
another
to
keep
them
for
other
well
hugh
returned
i
m
perhaps
not
so
absolutely
sure
of
myself
if
you
press
me
as
that
i
sha
n
t
be
glad
of
a
higher
and
wiser
opinion
i
mean
than
my
own
it
would
be
awfully
interesting
if
you
ll
allow
me
to
say
so
to
have
the
judgment
of
one
or
two
of
the
great
you
re
not
yourself
crimble
one
of
the
great
men
his
host
asked
with
tempered
irony
well
i
guess
he
s
going
to
be
anyhow
bender
cordially
struck
in
and
this
remarkable
exhibition
of
intelligence
may
just
let
him
loose
on
the
world
mayn
t
it
thank
you
bender
and
hugh
obviously
tried
to
look
neither
elated
nor
snubbed
i
ve
too
much
still
to
learn
but
i
m
learning
every
day
and
i
shall
have
learnt
immensely
this
pretty
well
at
my
expense
however
lord
theign
laughed
if
you
demolish
a
name
we
ve
held
for
generations
so
you
may
have
held
the
name
dear
my
lord
his
young
critic
answered
but
my
whole
point
is
that
if
i
m
right
you
ve
held
the
picture
itself
because
a
mantovano
said
lord
john
is
so
much
greater
a
value
hugh
met
his
eyes
a
moment
are
you
talking
of
values
pecuniary
what
values
are
pecuniary
hugh
might
during
his
hesitation
have
been
imagined
to
stand
off
a
little
from
the
question
well
some
things
have
in
a
higher
degree
that
one
and
some
have
the
associational
or
the
factitious
and
some
the
clear
and
some
bender
opined
have
them
in
the
highest
degree
but
what
you
mean
he
went
on
is
that
a
mantovano
would
come
higher
under
the
hammer
than
a
moretto
why
sir
the
young
man
returned
there
aren
t
any
as
i
ve
just
stated
i
account
or
i
easily
can
for
every
one
of
the
very
small
then
do
you
consider
that
you
account
for
this
one
i
believe
i
shall
if
you
ll
give
me
oh
time
bender
impatiently
sighed
but
we
ll
give
you
all
we
ve
got
only
i
guess
it
isn
t
and
he
appeared
freely
to
invite
their
companions
to
join
in
this
estimate
they
listened
to
him
however
they
watched
him
for
the
moment
but
in
silence
and
with
the
next
he
had
gone
on
how
much
higher
if
your
idea
is
correct
about
it
would
lord
theign
s
picture
come
hugh
turned
to
that
nobleman
does
bender
mean
come
to
my
lord
lord
theign
looked
again
hard
at
hugh
and
then
harder
than
he
had
done
yet
at
his
other
invader
i
don
t
know
bender
means
with
which
he
turned
off
well
i
guess
i
mean
that
it
would
come
higher
to
me
than
to
any
one
but
how
higher
the
american
continued
to
hugh
how
much
higher
to
oh
i
can
size
how
much
higher
as
a
mantovano
unmistakably
for
us
at
least
our
young
man
was
gaining
time
he
had
the
instinct
of
circumspection
and
delay
to
any
one
to
any
than
as
a
moretto
hugh
continued
it
even
acted
on
lord
john
s
nerves
that
s
what
we
re
talking
about
really
but
hugh
still
took
his
ease
as
if
with
his
eyes
first
on
bender
and
then
on
lord
theign
whose
back
was
practically
presented
he
were
covertly
studying
signs
well
he
presently
said
in
view
of
the
very
great
interest
combined
with
the
very
great
rarity
more
than
ah
more
than
can
be
estimated
it
made
lord
theign
turn
round
but
a
fine
moretto
has
a
very
great
rarity
and
a
very
great
yes
but
not
on
the
whole
the
same
amount
of
no
not
on
the
whole
the
same
amount
of
either
bender
judiciously
echoed
it
but
how
he
freely
pursued
are
you
going
to
find
out
have
i
your
permission
lord
theign
hugh
brightly
asked
to
attempt
to
find
out
the
question
produced
on
his
lordship
s
part
a
visible
a
natural
anxiety
what
would
it
be
your
idea
then
to
with
my
property
nothing
at
all
here
it
could
all
be
done
i
think
at
verona
what
besets
what
quite
haunts
me
hugh
explained
is
the
vivid
image
of
a
mantovano
one
of
the
glories
of
the
short
list
in
a
private
collection
in
that
place
the
conviction
grows
in
me
that
the
two
portraits
must
be
of
the
same
original
in
fact
i
ll
bet
my
head
the
young
man
quite
ardently
wound
up
that
the
wonderful
subject
of
the
verona
picture
a
very
great
person
clearly
is
none
other
than
the
very
great
person
of
lord
theign
had
listened
with
interest
mayn
t
he
be
that
and
yet
from
another
hand
it
isn
t
another
hand
oh
hugh
was
quite
positive
it
s
the
hand
of
the
very
same
how
can
you
prove
it
s
the
same
only
by
the
most
intimate
internal
evidence
i
admit
and
evidence
that
of
course
has
to
be
then
who
lord
theign
asked
is
to
estimate
it
well
hugh
was
all
ready
will
you
let
one
of
the
first
authorities
in
europe
a
good
friend
of
mine
in
fact
more
or
less
my
master
and
who
is
generally
to
be
found
at
brussels
i
happen
to
know
he
knows
your
picture
he
once
spoke
to
me
of
it
and
he
ll
go
and
look
again
at
the
verona
one
he
ll
go
and
judge
our
issue
if
i
apply
to
him
in
the
light
of
certain
new
tips
that
i
shall
be
able
to
give
lord
theign
appeared
to
wonder
if
you
apply
to
him
like
a
shot
i
believe
if
i
ask
it
of
him
as
a
a
service
to
he
ll
be
very
obliging
his
lordship
smiled
well
i
ve
obliged
hugh
readily
retorted
the
obligation
will
be
to
we
lord
theign
spoke
more
formally
well
the
satisfaction
said
hugh
will
be
to
all
of
us
the
things
pappendick
has
seen
he
intensely
ineffaceably
keeps
in
mind
to
every
detail
so
that
he
ll
tell
me
as
no
one
else
really
can
if
the
verona
man
is
but
then
asked
bender
we
ve
got
to
believe
anyway
what
he
says
the
market
said
lord
john
with
emphasis
would
have
to
believe
it
that
s
the
oh
hugh
returned
lightly
the
market
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
hope
but
i
think
you
ll
feel
when
he
has
spoken
that
you
really
know
where
you
bender
couldn
t
doubt
of
that
oh
if
he
gives
us
a
bigger
thing
we
won
t
complain
only
how
long
will
it
take
him
to
get
there
i
want
him
to
start
right
well
as
i
m
sure
he
ll
be
deeply
interested
we
bender
took
it
straight
up
get
news
next
week
hugh
addressed
his
reply
to
lord
theign
it
was
already
a
little
too
much
as
if
he
and
the
american
between
them
were
snatching
the
case
from
that
possessor
s
hands
the
day
i
hear
from
pappendick
you
shall
have
a
full
report
and
he
conscientiously
added
if
i
m
proved
to
have
been
unfortunately
wrong
his
lordship
easily
pointed
the
moral
you
ll
have
caused
me
some
of
course
i
shall
the
young
man
unreservedly
agreed
like
a
wanton
meddling
ass
his
candour
his
freedom
had
decidedly
a
note
of
their
own
but
my
conviction
after
those
moments
with
your
picture
was
too
strong
for
me
not
to
speak
and
since
you
allow
it
i
face
the
danger
and
risk
the
i
allow
it
of
course
in
the
form
of
this
produced
in
hugh
a
certain
blankness
business
if
i
consent
to
the
inquiry
i
pay
for
the
hugh
demurred
even
if
i
turn
out
mistaken
you
make
me
in
any
event
your
proper
the
young
man
thought
again
and
then
as
for
vague
accommodation
oh
my
charge
won
t
be
high
ah
bender
protested
it
ought
to
be
handsome
if
the
thing
s
marked
after
which
he
looked
at
his
watch
but
i
guess
i
ve
got
to
go
lord
theign
though
your
lovely
old
duchess
for
it
s
to
i
ve
lost
my
heart
does
cry
out
for
me
you
ll
find
her
then
still
there
lord
john
observed
with
emphasis
but
with
his
eyes
for
the
time
on
lord
theign
and
if
you
want
another
look
at
her
i
ll
presently
come
and
take
one
i
ll
order
your
car
to
the
lord
theign
added
to
this
you
ll
reach
it
from
the
saloon
but
i
ll
see
you
again
bender
glared
as
with
the
round
full
force
of
his
pair
of
motor
lamps
well
if
you
re
ready
to
talk
about
anything
i
am
but
hugh
addressing
their
host
while
his
returned
to
the
saloon
broke
into
the
familiarity
of
confidence
as
if
you
be
ready
to
talk
this
produced
on
the
part
of
the
others
present
a
mute
exchange
that
could
only
have
denoted
surprise
at
all
the
irrepressible
young
outsider
thus
projected
upon
them
took
for
granted
i
ve
an
idea
said
lord
john
to
his
friend
that
you
re
quite
ready
to
talk
with
hugh
then
with
his
appetite
so
richly
quickened
could
but
rejoice
lady
grace
spoke
to
me
of
things
in
the
you
ll
find
it
way
lord
theign
gave
the
indication
thanks
said
hugh
elatedly
and
hastened
away
lord
john
when
he
had
gone
found
relief
in
a
quick
comment
very
sharp
no
doubt
but
he
wants
taking
the
master
of
dedborough
wouldn
t
have
put
it
so
crudely
but
the
young
expert
did
bring
certain
things
home
the
people
my
daughters
in
the
exercise
of
a
wild
freedom
do
pick
up
well
don
t
you
see
that
all
you
ve
got
to
do
on
the
question
we
re
dealing
with
is
to
claim
your
very
own
wild
freedom
surely
i
m
right
in
feeling
you
lord
john
further
remarked
to
have
jumped
at
once
to
my
idea
that
bender
is
and
at
what
they
call
the
psychologic
moment
don
t
they
to
point
that
moral
why
look
anywhere
else
for
a
sum
of
money
that
smaller
or
greater
you
can
find
with
perfect
ease
in
that
extraordinarily
bulging
pocket
lord
theign
slowly
pacing
the
hall
again
threw
up
his
hands
ah
with
perfect
ease
can
scarcely
be
said
why
not
when
he
absolutely
thrusts
his
dirty
dollars
down
your
oh
i
m
not
talking
of
ease
to
lord
theign
returned
i
m
talking
of
ease
to
myself
i
shall
have
to
make
a
why
not
then
for
so
great
a
convenience
gallantly
make
it
ah
my
dear
chap
if
you
want
me
to
sell
my
sir
joshua
but
the
horror
in
the
words
said
enough
and
lord
john
felt
its
chill
i
don
t
make
a
point
of
that
god
forbid
but
there
are
other
things
to
which
the
objection
wouldn
t
you
see
how
it
applies
in
the
case
of
the
for
a
mere
moretto
said
lord
theign
is
too
cheap
for
a
yankee
on
the
then
the
mantovano
wouldn
t
it
remains
to
be
proved
that
it
a
well
said
lord
john
go
into
hanged
if
i
won
t
his
friend
broke
out
after
a
moment
it
suit
me
i
mean
the
explanation
came
after
a
brief
intensity
of
thought
the
possible
size
of
his
cheque
oh
said
lord
john
gaily
i
guess
there
s
no
limit
to
the
possible
size
of
his
cheque
yes
it
would
suit
me
it
would
suit
me
the
elder
man
standing
there
audibly
mused
but
his
air
changed
and
a
lighter
question
came
up
to
him
as
he
saw
his
daughter
reappear
at
the
door
from
the
terrace
well
the
infant
horde
he
immediately
put
to
her
lady
grace
came
in
dutifully
accounting
for
them
they
ve
marched
off
in
a
huge
thank
goodness
and
our
friends
all
playing
tennis
she
said
save
those
who
are
sitting
it
to
which
she
added
as
to
explain
her
return
mr
crimble
has
gone
lord
john
took
upon
him
to
say
he
s
in
the
library
to
which
you
addressed
him
making
not
then
i
hope
she
smiled
to
our
disadvantage
to
your
very
great
honour
and
lord
john
clearly
valued
the
effect
he
might
produce
your
moretto
of
brescia
do
you
know
what
it
really
and
spendidly
is
and
then
as
the
girl
in
her
surprise
but
wondered
a
mantovano
neither
more
nor
less
ever
so
much
more
a
mantovano
lady
grace
echoed
why
how
tremendously
jolly
her
father
was
struck
do
you
know
the
artist
of
whom
i
had
never
heard
yes
something
of
the
little
that
and
she
rejoiced
as
her
knowledge
came
to
her
he
s
a
tremendous
swell
because
great
as
he
was
there
are
but
seven
proved
examples
with
this
of
yours
lord
john
broke
in
there
are
then
why
haven
t
i
known
about
him
lord
theign
put
it
as
if
so
many
other
people
were
guilty
for
this
his
daughter
was
the
first
to
plead
for
the
vague
body
why
i
suppose
in
order
that
you
should
have
exactly
this
pleasure
oh
pleasures
not
desired
are
like
acquaintances
not
sought
they
rather
bore
one
lord
theign
sighed
with
which
he
moved
away
from
her
her
eyes
followed
him
an
instant
then
she
smiled
at
their
guest
is
he
bored
at
having
the
higher
prize
if
you
re
sure
it
the
higher
mr
crimble
is
sure
because
if
he
isn
t
lord
john
added
he
s
a
well
she
returned
as
he
s
certainly
not
a
wretch
it
must
be
true
and
fancy
she
exclaimed
further
though
as
more
particularly
for
herself
our
having
suddenly
incurred
this
immense
debt
to
him
oh
i
shall
pay
crimble
said
her
father
who
had
turned
round
the
whole
question
appeared
to
have
provoked
in
lord
john
a
rise
of
spirits
and
a
flush
of
humour
don
t
you
let
him
stick
it
his
host
however
bethinking
himself
checked
him
go
to
bender
straight
lord
john
saw
the
point
yes
till
he
leaves
but
i
shall
find
you
here
shan
t
i
he
asked
with
all
earnestness
of
lady
grace
she
had
an
hesitation
but
after
a
look
at
her
father
she
assented
i
ll
wait
for
then
tantôt
it
made
him
show
for
happy
as
waving
his
hand
at
her
he
proceeded
to
seek
bender
in
presence
of
the
object
that
most
excited
that
gentleman
s
appetite
to
say
nothing
of
the
effect
involved
on
lord
john
s
own
ix
lord
theign
when
he
had
gone
revolved
it
might
have
been
nervously
about
the
place
a
little
but
soon
broke
ground
he
ll
have
told
you
i
understand
that
i
ve
promised
to
speak
to
you
for
him
but
i
understand
also
that
he
has
found
something
to
say
for
yes
we
talked
a
while
since
the
girl
said
at
least
then
if
you
listened
i
hope
you
listened
with
a
good
oh
he
speaks
very
well
and
i
ve
never
disliked
it
pulled
her
father
up
is
that
when
i
think
so
much
of
him
she
seemed
to
say
that
she
had
to
her
own
mind
been
liberal
and
gone
far
but
she
waited
a
little
do
you
think
very
much
surely
i
ve
made
my
good
opinion
clear
to
you
again
she
had
a
pause
oh
yes
i
ve
seen
you
like
him
and
believe
in
him
and
i
ve
found
him
pleasant
and
he
has
never
had
lord
theign
more
or
less
ingeniously
explained
what
i
call
a
real
but
the
character
under
discussion
could
after
all
be
summed
up
without
searching
analysis
i
consider
nevertheless
that
there
s
plenty
in
it
was
a
moderate
claim
to
which
lady
grace
might
assent
he
strikes
me
as
naturally
quick
and
well
nice
but
i
agree
with
you
than
he
hasn
t
had
a
then
if
you
can
see
your
way
by
sympathy
and
confidence
to
help
him
to
one
i
dare
say
you
ll
find
your
for
a
third
time
she
considered
as
if
a
certain
curtness
in
her
companion
s
manner
rather
hindered
in
such
a
question
than
helped
didn
t
he
simplify
too
much
you
would
have
felt
her
ask
and
wasn
t
his
visible
wish
for
brevity
of
debate
a
sign
of
his
uncomfortable
and
indeed
rather
irritated
sense
of
his
not
making
a
figure
in
it
do
you
desire
it
very
particularly
was
however
all
she
at
last
brought
out
i
should
like
it
exceedingly
if
you
act
from
conviction
then
of
course
only
but
of
one
thing
i
m
myself
convinced
of
what
he
thinks
of
yourself
and
feels
for
then
would
you
mind
my
waiting
a
little
she
asked
i
mean
to
be
absolutely
sure
of
after
which
on
his
delaying
to
agree
she
added
frankly
as
to
help
her
case
upon
my
word
father
i
should
like
to
do
what
would
please
but
it
determined
in
him
a
sharper
impatience
ah
what
would
please
don
t
put
it
off
on
me
judge
absolutely
for
yourself
he
slightly
took
himself
up
in
the
light
of
my
having
consented
to
do
for
him
what
i
always
to
do
deviate
from
my
normal
practice
of
never
intermeddling
if
i
ve
deviated
now
you
can
judge
but
to
do
so
all
round
of
course
take
in
reason
your
may
i
ask
then
she
said
for
still
a
little
more
he
looked
for
this
verily
as
if
it
was
not
in
reason
you
know
he
then
returned
what
he
ll
feel
that
a
sign
well
i
ll
tell
him
what
i
then
i
ll
send
him
to
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
was
going
but
after
a
thanks
father
she
had
stopped
him
there
s
one
thing
an
embarrassment
showed
in
her
manner
but
at
the
cost
of
some
effect
of
earnest
abruptness
she
surmounted
it
what
does
your
american
bender
want
lord
theign
plainly
felt
the
challenge
my
american
he
s
none
of
mine
well
then
lord
john
he
s
none
of
his
either
more
i
mean
than
any
one
else
s
he
s
every
one
s
american
literally
to
all
appearance
and
i
ve
not
to
tell
surely
with
the
freedom
of
your
own
visitors
how
people
stalk
in
and
out
no
father
certainly
she
said
you
re
splendidly
his
eyes
seemed
rather
sharply
to
ask
her
then
how
he
could
improve
on
that
but
he
added
as
if
it
were
enough
what
the
man
must
by
this
time
want
more
than
anything
else
is
his
not
then
anything
of
ours
she
still
insisted
of
ours
he
echoed
with
a
frown
are
you
afraid
he
has
an
eye
to
something
of
why
if
we
ve
a
new
treasure
which
we
certainly
have
if
we
possess
a
mantovano
haven
t
we
all
even
i
an
immense
interest
in
it
and
before
he
could
answer
is
exposed
she
asked
lord
theign
a
little
unready
cast
about
at
his
storied
halls
any
illusion
to
the
exposure
of
the
objects
they
so
solidly
sheltered
was
obviously
unpleasant
to
him
but
then
it
was
as
if
he
found
at
a
stroke
both
his
own
reassurance
and
his
daughter
s
how
can
there
be
a
question
of
it
when
he
only
wants
sir
joshuas
he
wants
ours
the
girl
gasped
at
absolutely
any
but
you
re
not
she
cried
discussing
it
he
hesitated
as
between
chiding
and
contenting
her
then
he
handsomely
chose
my
dear
child
for
what
do
you
take
me
with
which
he
impatiently
started
through
the
long
and
stately
perspective
for
the
saloon
she
sank
into
a
chair
when
he
had
gone
she
sat
there
some
moments
in
a
visible
tension
of
thought
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
her
dropped
eyes
fixed
and
unperceiving
but
she
sprang
up
as
hugh
crimble
in
search
of
her
again
stood
before
her
he
presented
himself
as
with
winged
sandals
what
luck
to
find
you
i
must
take
my
spin
you
ve
seen
everything
as
you
wished
oh
he
smiled
i
ve
seen
she
showed
her
pleasure
yes
we
ve
got
some
so
bender
says
he
laughed
you
ve
got
five
or
six
only
five
or
six
she
cried
in
bright
alarm
only
he
continued
to
laugh
why
that
s
enormous
five
or
six
things
of
the
first
importance
but
i
think
i
ought
to
mention
to
you
he
added
a
most
barefaced
rubens
there
in
the
it
isn
t
a
rubens
no
more
than
i
m
a
then
you
ll
brand
us
expose
us
for
it
no
i
ll
let
you
off
i
ll
be
quiet
if
you
re
good
if
you
go
straight
i
ll
only
hold
it
one
can
t
be
sure
in
these
dreadful
days
that
s
always
to
remember
so
that
if
you
re
not
good
i
ll
come
down
on
you
with
it
but
to
balance
against
that
threat
he
went
on
i
ve
made
the
very
grandest
find
at
least
i
believe
i
have
she
was
all
there
for
this
news
of
the
hidden
in
the
other
thing
hugh
wondered
almost
as
if
she
had
been
before
him
you
don
t
mean
to
say
had
the
idea
of
that
no
but
my
father
has
told
and
is
your
father
he
eagerly
asked
really
gratified
with
her
conscious
eyes
on
him
her
eyes
could
clearly
be
very
conscious
about
her
father
she
considered
a
moment
he
always
prefers
old
associations
and
appearances
to
new
but
i
m
sure
he
ll
resign
himself
if
you
see
your
way
to
a
well
it
will
be
a
question
of
the
weight
of
expert
opinion
that
i
shall
invoke
but
i
m
not
afraid
he
resolutely
said
and
i
shall
make
the
thing
from
its
splendid
rarity
the
crown
and
flower
of
your
her
serious
face
shone
at
him
with
a
charmed
gratitude
it
s
awfully
beautiful
then
your
having
come
to
us
so
it
s
awfully
beautiful
your
having
brought
us
this
way
in
a
flash
as
dropping
out
of
a
chariot
of
fire
more
light
and
what
you
apparently
feel
with
myself
as
more
ah
the
beauty
s
in
your
having
yourself
done
it
he
returned
he
gave
way
to
the
positive
joy
of
it
if
i
ve
brought
the
light
and
the
rest
that
s
to
say
the
very
useful
information
who
in
the
world
was
it
brought
she
had
a
gesture
of
protest
you
d
have
come
in
some
other
i
m
not
so
sure
i
m
beastly
shy
little
as
i
may
seem
to
show
it
save
in
great
causes
when
i
m
horridly
bold
and
hideously
offensive
now
at
any
rate
i
only
know
what
she
turned
off
for
it
moving
away
from
him
as
with
a
sense
of
mingled
things
that
made
for
unrest
and
he
had
the
next
moment
grown
graver
under
the
impression
but
does
anything
in
it
all
he
asked
trouble
you
she
faced
about
across
the
wider
space
and
there
was
a
different
note
in
what
she
brought
out
i
don
t
know
what
forces
me
so
to
you
tell
me
he
stared
why
you
ve
told
me
nothing
more
monstrous
than
that
i
ve
been
welcome
well
however
that
may
be
what
did
you
mean
just
now
by
the
chance
of
our
not
going
straight
when
you
said
you
d
expose
our
bad
or
is
it
our
false
rubens
in
the
event
of
a
certain
oh
in
the
event
of
your
ever
being
bribed
he
laughed
again
as
with
relief
and
then
as
her
face
seemed
to
challenge
the
word
why
to
let
anything
of
your
best
ever
leave
dedborough
by
which
i
mean
really
of
course
leave
the
she
turned
again
on
this
and
something
in
her
air
made
him
wonder
i
hope
you
don
t
feel
there
such
a
danger
i
understood
from
you
half
an
hour
ago
that
it
was
well
it
to
me
half
an
hour
ago
she
said
as
she
came
nearer
but
if
it
has
since
come
up
if
it
has
but
it
in
the
form
of
that
monster
what
bender
wants
is
the
great
duchess
he
recalled
and
my
father
won
t
sell
no
he
won
t
sell
the
great
duchess
there
i
feel
safe
but
he
greatly
needs
a
certain
sum
of
money
or
he
thinks
he
does
and
i
ve
just
had
a
talk
with
in
which
he
has
told
you
that
he
has
told
me
nothing
lady
grace
said
or
else
told
me
quite
other
things
but
the
more
i
think
of
them
the
more
it
comes
to
me
that
he
feels
urged
or
tempted
to
despoil
and
denude
these
walls
hugh
broke
in
looking
about
in
his
sharper
apprehension
yes
to
satisfy
to
save
my
sister
do
you
think
our
state
so
ideal
she
asked
but
without
elation
for
her
hint
of
triumph
he
had
no
answer
for
this
save
ah
but
you
terribly
interest
me
may
i
ask
what
s
the
matter
with
your
sister
oh
she
wanted
to
go
on
straight
now
the
matter
is
in
the
first
place
that
she
s
too
dazzlingly
dreadfully
more
beautiful
than
you
his
sincerity
easily
risked
millions
of
sad
almost
sombre
she
hadn
t
a
shade
of
coquetry
kitty
has
debts
great
gaming
but
to
such
amounts
incredible
amounts
it
appears
and
mountains
of
others
too
she
throws
herself
all
on
our
and
he
to
pay
them
there
s
no
one
else
hugh
asked
she
waited
as
if
he
might
answer
himself
and
then
as
he
apparently
didn
t
he
s
only
afraid
there
be
some
else
that
s
how
she
makes
him
do
it
she
said
and
now
do
you
think
she
pursued
that
i
don
t
tell
you
things
he
turned
them
over
in
his
young
perception
and
pity
the
things
she
told
him
oh
oh
oh
and
then
in
the
great
place
while
as
just
spent
by
the
effort
of
her
disclosure
she
moved
from
him
again
he
took
them
all
in
that
s
the
situation
that
as
you
say
may
force
his
it
absolutely
i
feel
does
force
and
the
renewal
of
her
appeal
brought
her
round
isn
t
it
too
lovely
his
frank
disgust
answered
it
s
too
damnable
and
it
s
you
she
quite
terribly
smiled
who
by
the
irony
of
fate
have
given
him
he
smote
his
head
in
the
light
of
it
by
the
mantovano
by
the
possible
mantovano
as
a
substitute
for
the
impossible
sir
joshua
you
ve
made
him
aware
of
a
ah
but
the
value
s
to
be
fixed
then
bender
will
fix
it
oh
but
as
he
himself
would
say
i
ll
fix
bender
hugh
declared
and
he
won
t
buy
a
pig
in
a
this
cleared
the
air
while
they
looked
at
each
other
yet
she
had
already
asked
what
in
the
world
can
you
do
and
how
in
the
world
can
you
do
it
well
he
was
too
excited
for
decision
i
don
t
quite
see
now
but
give
me
and
he
took
out
his
watch
as
already
to
measure
it
oughtn
t
i
before
i
go
to
say
a
word
to
lord
theign
is
it
your
idea
to
become
a
lion
in
his
path
well
say
a
cub
as
that
s
what
i
m
afraid
he
ll
call
me
but
i
think
i
should
speak
to
she
drew
a
conclusion
momentarily
dark
he
ll
have
to
learn
in
that
case
that
i
ve
told
you
of
my
and
is
there
any
good
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
and
the
darkness
seemed
to
clear
no
she
at
last
replied
and
having
gone
to
touch
an
electric
bell
was
with
him
again
but
i
think
i
m
rather
sorry
for
does
that
represent
a
reason
why
i
should
be
so
for
you
for
a
little
she
said
nothing
but
after
that
none
whatever
then
is
the
sister
of
whom
you
speak
lady
imber
lady
grace
at
this
raised
her
hand
in
caution
the
butler
had
arrived
with
due
gravity
in
answer
to
her
ring
to
whom
she
made
known
her
desire
please
say
to
his
lordship
in
the
saloon
or
wherever
that
crimble
must
when
banks
had
departed
however
accepting
the
responsibility
of
this
mission
she
answered
her
friend
s
question
the
sister
of
whom
i
speak
is
lady
she
loses
then
so
heavily
at
bridge
she
loses
more
than
she
hugh
gazed
as
with
interest
at
these
oddities
of
the
great
and
yet
she
still
plays
what
else
in
her
set
should
she
do
this
he
was
quite
unable
to
say
but
he
could
after
a
moment
s
exhibition
of
the
extent
to
which
he
was
out
of
it
put
a
question
instead
so
not
in
her
set
i
m
not
in
her
then
decidedly
he
said
i
don
t
want
to
save
her
i
only
want
he
was
going
on
but
she
broke
in
i
know
what
you
want
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
till
he
had
made
sure
and
this
deep
exchange
between
them
had
a
beauty
so
you
re
now
me
i
m
now
you
then
said
hugh
shake
hands
on
it
he
offered
her
his
hand
she
took
it
and
their
grasp
became
as
you
would
have
seen
in
their
fine
young
faces
a
pledge
in
which
they
stood
a
minute
locked
lord
theign
came
upon
them
from
the
saloon
in
the
midst
of
the
process
on
which
they
separated
as
with
an
air
of
its
having
consisted
but
of
hugh
s
with
some
such
form
of
mere
civility
at
any
rate
he
appeared
by
the
manner
in
which
he
addressed
himself
to
hugh
to
have
supposed
them
occupied
i
m
sorry
my
daughter
can
t
keep
you
but
i
must
at
least
thank
you
for
your
interesting
view
of
my
hugh
indulged
in
a
brief
and
mute
though
very
grave
acknowledgment
of
this
expression
presently
speaking
however
as
on
a
resolve
taken
with
a
sense
of
possibly
awkward
consequences
may
i
before
you
re
sure
of
your
indebtedness
put
you
rather
a
straight
question
lord
theign
it
sounded
doubtless
and
of
a
sudden
a
little
portentous
as
was
in
fact
testified
to
by
his
lordship
s
quick
stiff
stare
full
of
wonder
at
so
free
a
note
but
hugh
had
the
courage
of
his
undertaking
if
i
contribute
in
ny
modest
degree
to
establishing
the
true
authorship
of
the
work
you
speak
of
may
i
have
from
you
an
assurance
that
my
success
isn
t
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
any
peril
or
possibility
of
its
leaving
the
country
lord
theign
was
visibly
astonished
but
had
also
independently
of
this
turned
a
shade
pale
you
ask
of
me
an
assurance
hugh
had
now
with
his
firmness
and
his
strained
smile
quite
the
look
of
having
counted
the
cost
of
his
step
i
m
afraid
i
you
it
pressed
at
once
in
his
host
the
spring
of
a
very
grand
manner
and
pray
by
what
right
here
do
you
do
anything
of
the
sort
by
the
right
of
a
person
from
whom
you
on
your
side
are
accepting
a
hugh
had
clearly
determined
in
his
opponent
a
rise
of
what
is
called
spirit
a
service
that
you
half
an
hour
ago
thrust
on
me
sir
and
with
which
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
i
m
already
quite
prepared
to
i
m
sorry
to
appear
indiscreet
our
young
man
returned
i
m
sorry
to
have
upset
you
in
any
way
but
i
can
t
overcome
my
anxiety
lord
theign
took
the
words
from
his
lips
and
you
therefore
invite
me
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
in
this
house
to
account
to
you
for
my
personal
intentions
and
my
private
affairs
and
make
over
my
freedom
to
your
hands
hugh
stood
there
with
his
eyes
on
the
black
and
white
pavement
that
stretched
about
him
the
great
marble
floor
that
might
have
figured
that
ground
of
his
own
vision
which
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
i
can
only
see
the
matter
as
i
see
it
and
i
should
be
ashamed
not
to
have
seized
any
chance
to
appeal
to
whatever
difficulty
he
had
had
shyly
to
face
didn
t
exist
for
him
now
i
entreat
you
to
think
again
to
think
before
you
deprive
us
of
such
a
source
of
just
and
you
regard
your
entreaty
as
helped
lord
theign
asked
by
the
beautiful
threat
you
are
so
good
as
to
attach
to
it
then
as
his
monitor
arrested
exchanged
a
searching
look
with
lady
grace
who
showing
in
her
face
all
the
pain
of
the
business
stood
off
at
the
distance
to
which
a
woman
instinctively
retreats
when
a
scene
turns
to
violence
as
precipitately
as
this
one
appeared
to
strike
her
as
having
turned
i
ask
you
that
not
less
than
i
should
like
to
know
whom
you
speak
of
as
deprived
of
property
that
happens
for
reasons
that
i
don
t
suppose
you
also
quarrel
with
to
be
well
i
know
nothing
about
threats
lord
theign
hugh
said
but
i
speak
of
of
us
of
all
the
people
of
england
who
would
deeply
deplore
such
an
act
of
alienation
and
whom
for
the
interest
they
bear
you
i
beseech
you
mercifully
to
the
interest
they
bear
me
the
master
of
dedborough
fairly
bristled
with
wonder
pray
how
the
devil
do
they
show
it
i
think
they
show
it
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
hugh
s
critical
smile
at
almost
any
moment
hovering
played
over
the
question
in
a
manner
seeming
to
convey
that
he
meant
many
things
understand
then
please
said
lord
theign
with
every
inch
of
his
authority
that
they
ll
show
it
best
by
minding
their
own
business
while
i
very
particularly
mind
you
simply
do
in
other
words
hugh
explicitly
concluded
what
happens
to
be
convenient
to
in
very
distinct
preference
to
what
happens
to
be
convenient
to
so
that
i
need
no
longer
detain
you
lord
theign
added
with
the
last
dryness
and
as
if
to
wind
up
their
brief
and
thankless
connection
the
young
man
took
his
dismissal
being
able
to
do
no
less
while
unsatisfied
and
unhappy
he
looked
about
mechanically
for
the
he
had
laid
down
somewhere
in
the
hall
on
his
arrival
i
apologise
my
lord
if
i
seem
to
you
to
have
ill
repaid
your
hospitality
but
he
went
on
with
his
uncommended
cheer
my
interest
in
your
picture
lady
grace
who
had
stopped
and
strayed
and
stopped
again
as
a
mere
watchful
witness
drew
nearer
hereupon
breaking
her
silence
for
the
first
time
and
please
let
me
say
father
that
mine
also
grows
and
it
was
obvious
that
this
parent
surprised
and
disconcerted
by
her
tone
judged
her
contribution
superfluous
i
m
happy
to
hear
it
grace
but
yours
is
another
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
it
s
quite
the
same
one
she
returned
since
it
s
on
my
hint
to
him
that
crimble
has
said
to
you
what
he
the
resolution
she
had
gathered
while
she
awaited
her
chance
sat
in
her
charming
eyes
which
met
as
she
spoke
the
straighter
paternal
glare
i
let
him
know
that
i
supposed
you
to
think
of
profiting
by
the
importance
of
bender
s
then
you
might
have
spared
my
dear
your
i
suppose
and
hope
interpretation
of
my
lord
theign
showed
himself
at
this
point
master
of
the
beautiful
art
of
righting
himself
as
without
having
been
in
the
wrong
mr
bender
s
visit
will
terminate
as
soon
as
he
has
released
lord
john
without
my
having
profited
in
the
smallest
hugh
meanwhile
evidently
but
wanted
to
speak
for
his
friend
it
was
lady
grace
s
anxious
inference
she
will
doubtless
let
me
say
for
her
that
my
idea
about
the
moretto
would
add
to
your
power
well
he
pushed
on
not
without
awkwardness
of
realising
advantageously
on
such
a
prospective
lord
theign
glanced
at
him
as
for
positively
the
last
time
but
spoke
to
lady
grace
understand
then
please
that
as
i
detach
myself
from
any
association
with
this
gentleman
s
ideas
whether
about
the
moretto
or
about
anything
else
his
further
application
of
them
ceases
from
this
moment
to
concern
the
girl
s
rejoinder
was
to
address
herself
directly
to
hugh
across
their
companion
will
you
make
your
inquiry
for
then
the
light
again
kindled
in
him
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
he
had
found
his
cap
and
taking
them
together
bowed
to
the
two
for
departure
with
high
emphasis
of
form
then
he
marched
off
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
entered
lord
theign
scarce
waited
for
his
disappearance
to
turn
in
wrath
to
lady
grace
i
denounce
the
indecency
wretched
child
of
your
public
defiance
of
me
they
were
separated
by
a
wide
interval
now
and
though
at
her
distance
she
met
his
reproof
so
unshrinkingly
as
perhaps
to
justify
the
terms
into
which
it
had
broken
she
became
aware
of
a
reason
for
his
not
following
it
up
she
pronounced
in
quick
warning
lord
john
for
their
friend
released
from
among
the
pictures
was
rejoining
them
was
already
there
he
spoke
straight
to
his
host
on
coming
into
sight
bender
s
at
last
off
but
he
indicated
the
direction
of
the
garden
front
you
may
still
find
him
out
yonder
prolonging
the
agony
with
lady
lord
theign
remained
a
moment
and
the
heat
of
his
resentment
remained
he
looked
with
a
divided
discretion
the
pain
of
his
indecision
from
his
daughter
s
suitor
and
his
approved
candidate
to
that
contumacious
young
woman
and
back
again
then
choosing
his
course
in
silence
he
had
a
gesture
of
almost
desperate
indifference
and
passed
quickly
out
by
the
door
to
the
terrace
it
had
left
lord
john
gaping
what
on
earth
s
the
matter
with
your
father
what
on
earth
indeed
lady
grace
unaidingly
asked
is
he
discussing
with
that
awful
man
old
bender
do
you
think
him
so
awful
lord
john
showed
surprise
which
might
indeed
have
passed
for
harmless
amusement
but
he
shook
everything
off
in
view
of
a
nearer
interest
he
quite
waved
old
bender
away
my
dear
girl
what
do
care
i
care
immensely
i
assure
you
she
interrupted
and
i
ask
of
you
please
to
tell
me
her
perversity
coming
straight
and
which
he
had
so
little
expected
threw
him
back
so
that
he
looked
at
her
with
sombre
eyes
ah
it
s
not
for
such
a
matter
i
m
here
lady
grace
i
m
here
with
that
fond
question
of
my
and
then
as
she
turned
away
leaving
him
with
a
vehement
motion
of
protest
i
ve
come
for
your
kind
answer
the
answer
your
father
instructed
me
to
count
i
ve
no
kind
answer
to
give
you
she
raised
forbidding
hands
i
entreat
you
to
leave
me
there
was
so
high
a
spirit
and
so
strong
a
force
in
it
that
he
stared
as
if
stricken
by
violence
in
god
s
name
then
what
has
happened
when
you
almost
gave
me
your
word
what
has
happened
is
that
i
ve
found
it
impossible
to
listen
to
and
she
moved
as
if
fleeing
she
scarce
knew
whither
before
him
he
had
already
hastened
around
another
way
however
as
to
meet
her
in
her
quick
circuit
of
the
hall
that
s
all
you
ve
got
to
say
to
me
after
what
has
passed
between
us
he
had
stopped
her
thus
but
she
had
also
stopped
him
and
her
passionate
denial
set
him
a
limit
i
ve
got
to
say
sorry
as
i
am
that
if
you
have
an
answer
it
s
this
that
never
lord
john
never
can
there
be
anything
more
between
and
her
gesture
cleared
her
path
permitting
her
to
achieve
her
flight
never
no
never
she
repeated
as
she
went
never
never
never
she
got
off
by
the
door
at
which
she
had
been
aiming
to
some
retreat
of
her
own
while
aghast
and
defeated
left
to
make
the
best
of
it
he
sank
after
a
moment
into
a
chair
and
remained
quite
pitiably
staring
before
him
appealing
to
the
great
blank
splendour
book
second
i
lady
sandgate
on
a
morning
late
in
may
entered
her
by
the
door
that
opened
at
the
right
of
that
charming
retreat
as
a
person
coming
in
faced
bruton
street
and
she
met
there
at
this
moment
gotch
her
butler
who
had
just
appeared
in
the
much
wider
doorway
forming
opposite
the
bruton
street
windows
an
apartment
not
less
ample
lighted
from
the
back
of
the
house
and
having
its
independent
connection
with
the
upper
floors
and
the
lower
she
showed
surprise
at
not
immediately
finding
the
visitor
to
whom
she
had
been
called
but
crimble
here
he
is
my
and
he
made
way
for
that
gentleman
who
emerged
from
the
back
room
gotch
observing
the
propriety
of
a
prompt
withdrawal
i
went
in
for
a
minute
with
your
servant
s
permission
hugh
explained
to
see
your
famous
lawrence
which
is
splendid
he
was
so
good
as
to
arrange
the
the
young
man
s
dress
was
of
a
form
less
relaxed
than
on
the
occasion
of
his
visit
to
dedborough
yet
the
soft
felt
hat
that
he
rather
restlessly
crumpled
as
he
talked
marked
the
limit
of
his
sacrifice
to
vain
appearances
lady
sandgate
was
at
once
interested
in
the
punctuality
of
his
reported
act
gotch
thinks
as
much
of
my
grandmother
as
i
do
and
even
seems
to
have
ended
by
taking
her
for
his
very
one
sees
unmistakably
from
her
beauty
that
you
at
any
rate
are
of
her
line
hugh
allowed
himself
not
without
confidence
the
amusement
of
replying
and
i
must
make
sure
of
another
look
at
her
when
i
ve
a
good
deal
more
his
hostess
heard
him
as
with
a
lapse
of
hope
you
hadn
t
then
come
the
poor
dear
and
then
as
he
obviously
hadn
t
but
for
something
quite
else
i
thought
from
so
prompt
an
interest
that
she
might
be
coveted
it
dropped
with
a
yearning
sigh
you
imagined
me
sent
by
some
prowling
collector
hugh
asked
ah
i
shall
never
do
their
work
unless
to
betray
them
i
shouldn
t
in
the
least
mind
and
i
m
here
frankly
at
this
early
hour
to
ask
your
consent
to
my
seeing
lady
grace
a
moment
on
a
particular
business
if
she
can
kindly
give
me
you
ve
known
then
of
her
being
with
me
i
ve
known
of
her
coming
to
you
straight
on
leaving
dedborough
he
explained
of
her
wishing
not
to
go
to
her
sister
s
and
of
lord
theign
s
having
proceeded
as
they
say
or
being
on
the
point
of
proceeding
to
some
foreign
and
you
ve
learnt
it
from
having
seen
her
these
three
or
four
weeks
i
ve
met
her
but
just
barely
two
or
three
times
at
a
private
view
at
the
opera
in
the
lobby
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
she
hasn
t
told
you
lady
sandgate
neither
affirmed
nor
denied
she
only
turned
on
him
her
thick
lustre
i
wanted
to
see
how
much
she
waited
even
as
for
more
but
this
not
coming
she
helped
herself
once
again
at
dinner
yes
but
alas
not
near
her
once
then
at
a
private
view
when
with
the
squash
they
usually
are
you
might
have
been
very
near
her
indeed
the
young
man
his
hilarity
quickened
took
but
a
moment
for
the
truth
yes
it
a
squash
and
once
his
hostess
pursued
in
the
lobby
of
the
opera
after
tristan
yes
but
with
some
awful
grand
people
i
didn
t
she
recognised
she
estimated
the
grandeur
oh
the
pennimans
are
nobody
but
now
she
asked
you
ve
come
you
say
on
business
very
important
please
which
accounts
for
the
hour
i
ve
ventured
and
the
appearance
i
i
don
t
ask
you
too
much
to
account
lady
sandgate
kindly
said
but
i
can
t
not
wonder
if
she
hasn
t
told
you
what
things
have
he
cast
about
she
has
had
no
chance
to
tell
me
anything
beyond
the
fact
of
her
being
without
the
reason
the
reason
he
echoed
she
gave
it
up
going
straighter
she
s
with
me
then
as
an
old
firm
friend
under
my
care
and
i
see
he
took
it
with
more
penetration
than
enthusiasm
as
a
hint
in
respect
to
himself
she
puts
you
on
your
lady
sandgate
expressed
it
more
graciously
she
puts
me
on
my
honour
or
at
least
her
father
as
to
her
seeing
as
to
seeing
at
least
what
may
happen
to
because
you
say
things
happened
his
companion
fairly
sounded
him
you
ve
only
talked
when
you
ve
met
of
art
well
he
smiled
art
is
long
then
i
hope
it
may
see
you
through
but
you
should
know
first
that
lord
theign
is
presently
due
back
already
from
abroad
he
was
all
alert
he
has
not
yet
gone
he
comes
up
this
morning
to
and
stops
here
on
his
way
to
take
the
de
this
afternoon
to
his
annual
salsomaggiore
but
with
so
little
time
to
spare
she
went
on
reassuringly
that
to
simplify
as
he
wired
me
an
hour
ago
from
dedborough
he
has
given
rendezvous
here
to
bender
who
is
particularly
to
wait
for
and
who
may
therefore
arrive
at
any
moment
she
looked
at
her
bracelet
watch
scarcely
before
noon
so
you
ll
just
have
your
chance
thank
the
powers
then
hugh
grasped
at
it
i
shall
have
it
best
if
you
ll
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
first
well
he
faltered
what
it
is
that
to
my
great
disquiet
you
ve
further
alluded
to
what
it
is
that
has
lady
sandgate
took
her
time
but
her
and
other
sentiments
pronounced
haven
t
you
at
least
guessed
that
she
has
fallen
under
her
father
s
extreme
reprobation
yes
so
much
as
that
that
she
must
have
greatly
annoyed
him
i
have
been
supposing
but
isn
t
it
by
her
having
asked
me
to
act
for
her
i
mean
about
the
mantovano
which
i
lady
sandgate
wondered
you
ve
acted
it
s
what
i
ve
come
to
tell
her
at
last
and
i
m
all
i
see
i
see
she
had
caught
a
clue
he
hated
that
yes
but
you
haven
t
really
made
out
she
put
to
him
the
effect
of
your
hour
at
dedborough
she
recognised
however
while
she
spoke
that
his
divination
had
failed
and
she
didn
t
trouble
him
to
confess
it
directly
you
had
gone
she
turned
down
lord
john
declined
i
mean
the
offer
of
his
hand
in
hugh
was
clearly
as
much
mystified
as
anything
else
he
proposed
there
he
had
spoken
that
day
before
your
talk
with
lord
theign
who
had
every
confidence
in
her
accepting
him
but
you
came
crimble
you
went
and
when
her
suitor
reappeared
just
after
you
gone
for
his
answer
she
wouldn
t
have
him
hugh
asked
with
a
precipitation
of
interest
but
lady
sandgate
could
humour
almost
any
curiosity
she
wouldn
t
look
at
he
bethought
himself
but
had
she
said
she
would
so
her
father
indignantly
that
s
the
of
his
indignation
he
had
his
reasons
for
counting
on
her
and
it
has
determined
a
painful
hugh
crimble
turned
this
over
feeling
apparently
for
something
he
didn
t
find
i
m
sorry
to
hear
such
things
but
where
s
the
connection
with
me
ah
you
know
best
yourself
and
if
you
don
t
see
any
in
that
case
lady
sandgate
s
motion
implied
she
washed
her
hands
of
it
hugh
had
for
a
moment
the
air
of
a
young
man
treated
to
the
sweet
chance
to
guess
a
conundrum
which
he
gave
up
i
really
don
t
see
any
lady
sandgate
but
he
a
little
inconsistently
said
i
m
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
telling
don
t
mention
it
though
i
think
it
good
of
me
she
smiled
on
so
short
an
to
which
she
added
more
gravely
i
leave
you
the
situation
but
i
m
willing
to
let
you
know
that
i
m
all
on
grace
s
so
am
i
please
let
me
frankly
he
clearly
refreshed
he
even
almost
charmed
her
it
s
the
very
least
you
can
say
though
i
m
not
sure
whether
you
say
it
as
the
simplest
or
as
the
very
subtlest
of
men
but
in
case
you
don
t
know
as
i
do
how
little
the
particular
candidate
i
ve
named
had
a
right
or
a
claim
to
succeed
with
her
he
broke
in
all
quick
intelligence
here
at
least
no
i
don
t
perhaps
know
as
well
as
you
do
but
i
think
i
know
as
well
as
i
just
yet
there
you
are
then
and
if
you
did
prevent
his
hostess
maturely
pursued
what
wouldn
t
have
been
well
good
or
nice
i
m
quite
on
your
side
our
young
man
seemed
to
feel
the
shade
of
ambiguity
but
he
reached
at
a
meaning
you
re
with
me
in
my
plea
for
our
defending
at
any
cost
of
effort
or
ingenuity
the
precious
picture
lord
theign
exposes
she
took
his
presumed
sense
faster
than
he
had
taken
hers
but
she
hung
fire
a
moment
with
her
reply
to
it
well
will
you
keep
the
secret
of
everything
i
ve
said
or
say
to
the
death
to
the
stake
lady
sandgate
then
she
momentously
returned
i
only
want
too
to
make
bender
impossible
if
you
ask
me
she
pursued
how
i
arrange
that
with
my
deep
loyalty
to
lord
theign
i
don
t
ask
you
anything
of
the
sort
he
interrupted
i
wouldn
t
ask
you
for
the
world
and
my
own
bright
plan
for
achieving
the
you
mention
you
ll
have
time
at
the
most
she
said
consulting
afresh
her
bracelet
watch
to
explain
to
lady
she
reached
an
electric
bell
which
she
touched
facing
then
her
visitor
again
with
an
abrupt
and
slightly
embarrassed
change
of
tone
you
do
think
great
portrait
splendid
he
had
strayed
far
from
it
and
all
too
languidly
came
back
your
lawrence
there
as
i
said
but
the
butler
had
come
in
interrupting
straight
from
the
lobby
of
whom
she
made
her
request
let
her
ladyship
know
gotch
looked
hard
at
hugh
and
the
crumpled
hat
almost
as
if
having
an
option
but
he
resigned
himself
to
repeating
with
a
distinctness
that
scarce
fell
short
of
the
invidious
mr
crimble
and
departed
on
his
errand
lady
sandgate
s
fair
flush
of
diplomacy
had
meanwhile
not
faded
couldn
t
you
with
your
immense
cleverness
and
power
get
the
government
to
do
something
about
your
picture
hugh
betrayed
on
this
head
a
graceless
detachment
you
too
then
want
to
sell
oh
she
righted
herself
never
to
a
private
party
mr
bender
s
not
after
it
he
asked
though
scarce
lighting
his
reluctant
interest
with
a
forced
smile
most
intensely
after
it
but
never
cried
the
proprietress
to
a
bloated
alien
then
i
applaud
your
patriotism
only
why
not
he
asked
carrying
that
magnanimity
a
little
further
set
us
all
an
example
as
splendid
as
the
object
itself
give
it
you
for
nothing
she
threw
up
shocked
hands
because
i
m
an
aged
female
pauper
and
can
t
make
hugh
pretended
none
too
convincingly
to
think
will
you
let
them
have
it
very
cheap
yes
for
less
than
such
a
bribe
as
bender
ah
he
said
expressively
that
might
be
and
still
well
she
had
a
flare
of
fond
confidence
i
ll
find
out
what
he
ll
offer
if
you
ll
on
your
side
do
what
you
can
and
then
ask
them
a
third
and
she
followed
it
up
as
if
suddenly
conceiving
him
a
prig
see
here
crimble
i
ve
been
and
this
very
first
time
i
charming
to
you
have
indeed
he
returned
but
you
throw
back
on
it
a
lurid
light
if
it
has
all
been
for
it
has
been
well
to
keep
things
as
i
want
them
and
if
i
ve
given
you
precious
information
mightn
t
you
on
your
side
estimate
its
value
in
cash
hugh
sharply
took
her
up
ah
lady
sandgate
i
in
your
debt
but
if
you
really
bargain
for
your
precious
information
i
d
rather
we
assume
that
i
haven
t
enjoyed
she
made
him
however
in
reply
a
sign
for
silence
she
had
heard
lady
grace
enter
the
other
room
from
the
back
landing
and
reaching
the
nearer
door
she
disposed
of
the
question
with
high
gay
bravery
i
won
t
bargain
with
the
treasury
she
had
passed
out
by
the
time
lady
grace
arrived
ii
as
hugh
recognised
in
this
friend
s
entrance
and
face
the
light
of
welcome
he
went
full
of
his
subject
straight
to
their
main
affair
i
haven
t
been
able
to
wait
i
ve
wanted
so
much
to
tell
you
i
mean
how
i
ve
just
come
back
from
brussels
where
i
saw
who
was
free
and
ready
by
the
happiest
chance
to
start
for
verona
which
he
must
have
reached
some
time
the
girl
s
responsive
interest
fairly
broke
into
rapture
ah
the
dear
sweet
thing
yes
he
s
a
brick
but
the
question
now
hangs
in
the
balance
allowing
him
time
to
have
got
into
relation
with
the
picture
i
ve
begun
to
expect
his
wire
which
will
probably
come
to
my
club
but
my
fidget
while
i
wait
has
driven
me
he
threw
out
and
dropped
his
arms
in
expression
of
his
soft
surrender
well
just
to
do
to
come
to
you
here
in
my
fever
at
an
unnatural
hour
and
uninvited
and
at
least
let
you
know
i
ve
oh
but
i
simply
rejoice
lady
grace
declared
to
be
acting
then
if
you
are
if
you
are
the
young
man
cried
why
everything
s
beautiful
and
right
it
s
all
i
care
for
and
think
of
now
she
went
on
in
her
bright
devotion
and
i
ve
only
wondered
and
hoped
well
hugh
found
for
it
all
a
rapid
abundant
lucidity
he
was
away
from
home
at
first
and
i
had
to
wait
but
i
crossed
last
week
found
him
and
settled
incoming
home
by
paris
where
i
had
a
grand
four
days
jaw
with
the
fellows
there
and
saw
great
specimen
of
our
master
all
of
which
has
given
him
and
now
his
time
s
up
the
girl
eagerly
asked
it
be
and
we
shall
but
hugh
postponed
that
question
to
a
matter
of
more
moment
still
the
thing
is
that
at
last
i
m
able
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
the
trouble
i
ve
brought
it
made
her
quickly
colouring
rest
grave
eyes
on
him
what
do
you
know
when
i
haven
t
told
you
about
my
trouble
can
t
i
have
guessed
with
a
ray
of
intelligence
he
had
his
answer
ready
you
ve
sought
asylum
with
this
good
friend
from
the
effects
of
your
father
s
sought
asylum
is
perhaps
excessive
lady
grace
returned
though
it
wasn
t
pleasant
with
him
after
that
hour
no
she
allowed
and
i
couldn
t
go
you
see
to
no
indeed
you
couldn
t
go
to
he
smiled
at
her
hard
as
he
added
i
should
have
liked
to
see
you
go
to
kitty
therefore
exactly
is
it
that
i
ve
set
you
adrift
that
i
ve
darkened
and
poisoned
your
days
you
re
paying
with
your
comfort
with
your
peace
for
having
joined
so
gallantly
in
my
grand
she
shook
her
head
turning
from
him
but
then
turned
back
again
as
if
accepting
as
if
even
relieved
by
this
version
of
the
prime
cause
of
her
state
why
do
you
talk
of
it
as
paying
if
it
s
all
to
come
back
to
my
paid
i
mean
by
your
blest
success
if
you
really
do
what
you
i
have
your
word
for
it
he
searchingly
said
that
our
really
pulling
it
off
together
will
make
up
to
you
i
should
be
ashamed
if
it
didn
t
for
everything
she
took
the
question
from
his
mouth
i
believe
in
such
a
cause
exactly
as
you
do
and
found
a
lesson
at
dedborough
in
your
frankness
and
your
then
you
ll
help
me
no
end
he
said
all
simply
and
sincerely
you
ve
helped
already
that
she
gave
him
straight
back
and
on
it
they
stayed
a
moment
their
strenuous
faces
more
intensely
communing
you
re
very
wonderful
for
a
girl
hugh
brought
out
one
to
be
a
girl
naturally
to
be
a
daughter
of
one
s
house
she
laughed
and
that
s
all
i
am
of
ours
but
a
true
and
a
right
and
a
straight
he
glowed
with
his
admiration
you
re
splendid
that
might
be
or
not
her
light
shrug
intimated
she
gave
it
at
any
rate
the
and
more
exactly
stated
her
case
i
see
our
so
do
i
lady
grace
he
cried
with
the
strongest
emphasis
and
your
father
only
doesn
yes
she
said
for
intelligent
correction
he
sees
it
there
s
nothing
in
life
he
sees
so
much
but
unfortunately
he
sees
it
all
hugh
seized
her
point
of
view
as
if
there
had
been
nothing
of
her
that
he
wouldn
t
have
seized
he
sees
it
all
wrong
then
my
appeal
the
other
day
he
took
as
a
rude
protest
and
any
protest
any
protest
she
quickly
and
fully
agreed
he
takes
as
an
offence
yes
it
s
his
theory
that
he
still
has
rights
she
smiled
though
he
a
miserable
how
should
he
not
have
rights
said
hugh
when
he
has
really
everything
on
earth
ah
he
doesn
t
even
that
he
takes
it
so
much
for
and
she
sought
though
as
rather
sadly
and
despairingly
to
explain
he
lives
all
in
his
own
he
lives
all
in
his
own
yes
but
he
does
business
all
in
ours
quite
as
much
as
the
people
who
come
up
to
the
city
in
the
with
which
hugh
had
a
still
sharper
recall
of
the
stiff
actual
and
he
must
be
here
to
do
business
you
know
lady
grace
asked
that
he
s
to
meet
bender
lady
sandgate
kindly
warned
me
and
her
companion
saw
as
he
glanced
at
the
clock
on
the
chimney
i
ve
only
ten
minutes
at
best
the
journal
won
t
have
been
good
for
him
he
added
you
doubtless
have
seen
the
journal
no
she
was
vague
we
live
by
the
morning
that
s
why
our
friend
here
didn
t
speak
then
hugh
said
with
a
better
light
which
out
of
a
dim
consideration
for
her
i
didn
t
do
either
but
they
ve
a
leader
this
morning
about
lady
lappington
and
her
longhi
and
on
bender
and
his
hauls
and
on
the
certainty
if
we
don
t
do
something
energetic
of
more
and
more
benders
to
come
such
a
conquering
horde
as
invaded
the
old
civilisation
only
armed
now
with
huge
instead
of
with
spears
and
they
refer
to
the
rumour
current
as
too
horrific
to
believe
of
lord
theign
s
putting
up
his
moretto
with
the
question
of
how
properly
to
qualify
any
such
sad
purpose
in
him
should
the
further
report
prove
true
of
a
new
and
momentous
opinion
about
the
picture
entertained
by
several
eminent
of
whom
said
the
girl
intensely
attached
to
this
recital
you
re
of
course
seen
as
not
the
of
whom
of
course
lady
grace
i
m
as
yet
however
i
m
seen
the
whole
collection
but
we
ve
time
he
rested
on
that
the
fat
if
you
ll
allow
me
the
expression
is
on
the
fire
which
as
i
see
the
matter
is
where
this
particular
fat
is
the
article
then
his
companion
appealed
very
severe
i
prefer
to
call
it
very
enlightened
and
very
intelligent
and
the
great
thing
is
that
it
immensely
marks
as
they
say
it
will
have
made
a
big
public
difference
from
this
day
though
it
s
of
course
aimed
not
so
much
at
persons
as
at
conditions
which
it
calls
upon
us
all
somehow
to
exactly
she
was
full
of
the
saving
vision
but
as
the
conditions
are
directly
embodied
in
persons
oh
of
course
it
here
and
there
bells
the
cat
which
means
that
it
bells
three
or
yes
she
richly
brooded
lady
lappington
a
cat
she
will
have
been
belled
at
any
rate
with
your
father
hugh
amusedly
went
on
to
the
certainty
of
a
row
and
a
row
can
only
be
good
for
us
i
mean
for
in
yet
he
had
to
bethink
himself
the
case
depends
a
good
deal
of
course
on
how
your
father
such
a
resounding
oh
i
know
how
he
ll
take
it
her
perception
went
all
the
way
in
the
very
highest
and
properest
spirit
well
you
ll
she
was
as
brave
as
she
was
clear
or
at
least
i
shall
struck
with
all
this
in
her
he
renewed
his
homage
you
yes
splendid
i
even
she
laughed
surprise
but
he
was
already
back
at
his
calculations
how
early
do
the
papers
get
to
you
at
dedborough
oh
quite
for
breakfast
which
isn
t
however
very
then
that
s
what
has
caused
his
wire
to
but
how
will
such
talk
strike
the
girl
asked
hugh
meanwhile
visibly
had
not
only
followed
his
train
of
thought
he
had
let
it
lead
him
to
certainty
it
will
have
moved
bender
to
absolute
rather
lady
grace
wondered
than
have
put
him
off
it
will
have
put
him
prodigiously
bender
as
he
said
to
me
at
dedborough
of
his
noble
host
there
hugh
pursued
is
a
very
nice
man
but
he
s
a
product
of
the
world
of
advertisment
and
advertisement
is
all
he
sees
and
aims
at
he
lives
in
it
as
a
saint
in
glory
or
a
fish
in
she
took
it
from
him
as
half
doubting
but
mayn
t
advertisement
in
so
special
a
case
turn
on
the
whole
against
him
hugh
shook
a
negative
forefinger
with
an
expression
he
might
have
caught
from
foreign
comrades
he
rides
the
biggest
whirlwind
he
has
got
it
saddled
and
she
faced
the
image
but
cast
about
then
where
does
our
success
come
in
in
our
making
the
beast
all
the
same
bolt
with
him
and
throw
and
hugh
further
pointed
the
moral
if
in
such
proceedings
all
he
knows
is
publicity
the
thing
is
to
give
him
publicity
and
it
s
only
a
question
of
giving
him
enough
by
the
time
he
has
enough
for
himself
you
see
he
ll
have
too
much
for
every
one
else
so
that
we
shall
up
in
a
body
and
slay
the
girl
s
eyebrows
in
her
wondering
face
rose
to
a
question
but
if
he
has
meanwhile
got
the
picture
we
ll
slay
him
before
he
gets
it
he
revelled
in
the
breadth
of
his
view
our
own
policy
must
be
to
to
that
end
the
inevitable
outcry
organise
bender
himself
organise
him
to
hugh
had
already
even
pity
to
spare
for
their
victim
he
won
t
know
it
from
a
though
carried
along
however
lady
grace
could
still
measure
but
that
will
be
only
if
he
wants
and
decides
for
the
we
must
make
him
then
want
and
decide
for
it
decide
that
is
for
to
save
it
we
must
work
him
up
he
ll
in
that
case
want
it
so
indecently
much
then
shall
have
to
want
it
more
well
she
anxiously
felt
it
her
duty
to
remind
him
you
can
take
a
horse
to
water
oh
trust
me
to
make
him
drink
there
appeared
a
note
in
this
that
convinced
her
it
s
you
crimble
who
are
splendid
well
i
shall
be
with
my
jolly
wire
and
all
on
that
scent
again
may
i
come
back
to
you
from
the
club
with
pappendick
s
news
he
asked
why
rather
of
course
come
back
only
not
he
debated
till
your
father
has
lady
grace
considered
too
but
sharply
decided
come
when
you
it
but
tell
me
first
she
added
one
she
hung
fire
a
little
while
he
waited
but
she
brought
it
out
was
it
you
who
got
the
journal
to
speak
ah
one
scarcely
gets
the
journal
who
then
gave
them
their
tip
about
the
mantovano
and
its
peril
well
he
took
a
moment
but
only
not
to
say
in
addition
to
which
the
butler
had
reappeared
entering
from
the
lobby
i
ll
tell
you
he
laughed
when
i
come
back
gotch
had
his
manner
of
announcement
while
the
visitor
was
mounting
the
stairs
mr
breckenridge
bender
ah
then
i
go
said
lady
grace
at
once
i
ll
stay
three
hugh
turned
with
her
alertly
to
the
easier
issue
signalling
hope
and
cheer
from
that
threshold
as
he
watched
her
disappear
after
which
he
faced
about
with
as
brave
a
smile
and
as
ready
for
immediate
action
as
if
she
had
there
within
kissed
her
hand
to
him
bender
emerged
at
the
same
instant
gotch
withdrawing
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
the
former
personage
recognising
his
young
friend
threw
up
his
hands
for
friendly
pleasure
iii
ah
crimble
he
cordially
inquired
you
ve
come
with
your
great
news
hugh
caught
the
allusion
it
would
have
seemed
but
after
a
moment
news
of
the
moretto
no
bender
i
haven
t
news
but
he
added
as
with
high
candour
for
the
visitor
s
motion
of
disappointment
i
think
i
warned
you
you
know
that
it
would
take
three
or
four
well
in
country
bender
returned
with
disgust
it
would
take
three
or
four
minutes
can
t
you
make
em
step
more
lively
i
m
expecting
sir
said
hugh
a
report
from
hour
to
then
will
you
let
me
have
it
right
off
hugh
indulged
in
a
pause
after
which
very
frankly
ah
it
s
scarcely
for
you
bender
that
i
m
acting
the
great
collector
was
but
briefly
checked
well
can
t
you
just
act
for
art
oh
you
re
doing
that
yourself
so
powerfully
hugh
laughed
that
i
think
i
had
best
leave
it
to
you
his
friend
looked
at
him
as
some
inspector
on
circuit
might
look
at
a
new
improvement
don
t
you
want
to
go
round
acting
me
go
on
tour
as
it
were
oh
frankly
bender
hugh
said
if
i
had
any
weight
you
d
add
it
to
your
end
of
the
beam
why
what
have
i
done
that
should
go
back
on
me
after
working
me
up
so
down
there
the
worst
i
ve
done
bender
continued
is
to
refuse
that
has
it
deplorably
been
you
our
young
man
cried
unmistakably
and
sincerely
affected
after
which
he
went
on
as
his
only
eyed
him
hard
not
on
second
thoughts
giving
the
owner
of
the
great
work
away
then
why
are
you
as
if
you
were
a
banished
romeo
so
keen
for
news
from
verona
to
this
odd
mixture
of
business
and
literature
bender
made
no
reply
contenting
himself
with
but
a
large
vague
blandness
that
wore
in
him
somehow
the
mark
of
tested
utility
so
that
hugh
put
him
another
question
aren
t
you
here
sir
on
the
chance
of
the
mantovano
i
m
here
he
then
imperturbably
said
because
lord
theign
has
wired
me
to
meet
him
ain
t
you
here
for
that
yourself
hugh
betrayed
for
a
moment
his
enjoyment
of
a
big
choice
of
answers
dear
no
i
ve
but
been
in
by
lady
sandgate
s
leave
to
see
that
grand
ah
yes
she
s
very
kind
about
it
one
does
go
after
which
bender
had
even
in
the
atmosphere
of
his
danger
a
throb
of
curiosity
is
any
one
that
grand
lawrence
oh
i
hope
not
hugh
laughed
unless
you
again
dreadfully
are
wonderful
thing
as
it
is
and
so
just
in
its
right
place
you
call
it
bender
impartially
inquired
a
wonderful
thing
well
as
a
lawrence
it
has
quite
bowled
me
over
hugh
spoke
as
for
the
strictly
aesthetic
awkwardness
of
that
but
you
know
i
take
my
pictures
he
gave
a
punch
to
his
hat
pressed
for
time
in
this
connection
as
he
was
glad
truly
to
appear
to
his
friend
i
must
make
my
little
yet
before
it
he
did
seek
briefly
to
explain
we
re
a
band
of
young
men
who
care
and
we
watch
the
great
things
also
for
i
must
give
you
the
real
truth
about
myself
we
watch
the
great
well
i
guess
i
m
used
to
being
watched
if
that
s
the
worst
you
can
to
which
bender
added
in
his
homely
way
but
you
know
crimble
what
i
m
hugh
s
strategy
on
this
would
again
have
peeped
out
for
us
the
man
in
this
morning
s
journal
appears
at
least
to
have
yes
the
man
in
this
morning
s
journal
has
discovered
three
or
four
weeks
as
it
appears
to
take
you
here
for
everything
after
my
beginning
to
talk
why
they
knew
i
was
talking
time
ago
on
the
other
oh
they
know
things
in
the
states
hugh
cheerfully
agreed
so
independently
of
their
happening
but
you
must
have
talked
well
i
haven
t
so
much
talked
as
raved
bender
conceded
for
i
m
afraid
that
when
i
do
want
a
thing
i
rave
till
i
get
it
you
heard
me
at
and
your
enterprising
daily
press
has
at
last
caught
the
then
they
ll
make
up
for
lost
time
but
have
you
done
it
hugh
asked
to
prepare
an
alibi
an
alibi
by
raving
as
you
say
the
saddle
on
the
wrong
horse
i
don
t
think
you
at
all
believe
you
ll
get
the
sir
joshua
but
meanwhile
we
shall
have
cleared
up
the
question
of
the
bender
imperturbable
didn
t
speak
till
he
had
done
justice
to
this
picture
of
his
subtlety
then
why
on
earth
do
you
want
to
boom
the
moretto
you
ask
that
said
hugh
because
it
s
the
boomed
thing
that
s
most
in
well
it
s
the
big
the
bigger
the
biggest
things
and
if
you
drag
their
value
to
the
light
why
shouldn
t
we
want
to
grab
them
and
carry
them
off
the
same
as
all
of
originally
did
ah
not
quite
the
same
hugh
smiled
that
i
say
for
you
yes
you
stick
it
on
now
you
got
an
eye
for
the
rise
in
values
but
i
grant
you
your
unearned
increment
and
you
ought
to
be
mighty
glad
that
to
such
a
time
i
ll
pay
it
our
young
man
kept
during
a
moment
s
thought
his
eyes
on
his
companion
and
then
resumed
with
all
intensity
and
candour
you
may
easily
bender
be
too
much
for
me
as
you
appear
too
much
for
far
greater
people
but
may
i
ask
you
very
earnestly
for
your
word
on
as
to
any
case
in
which
that
happens
that
when
precious
things
things
we
are
to
lose
here
knocked
down
to
you
you
ll
let
us
at
least
take
leave
of
them
let
us
have
a
sight
of
them
in
london
before
they
re
borne
off
bender
s
big
face
fell
almost
with
a
crash
hand
them
over
you
mean
to
the
sandwich
men
on
bond
street
to
one
or
other
of
the
placard
and
poster
men
i
don
t
insist
on
the
inserted
human
slice
let
the
great
values
as
a
compensation
to
us
be
on
view
for
three
or
four
you
ask
me
bender
returned
for
a
assurance
to
that
effect
well
a
particular
one
so
it
be
particular
enough
hugh
said
will
do
just
for
now
let
me
put
in
my
plea
for
the
issue
well
of
the
value
that
s
actually
in
the
the
the
bender
carnivorously
smiled
hadn
t
we
better
know
which
it
is
first
hugh
had
a
motion
of
practical
indifference
for
this
the
public
interest
playing
so
straight
on
the
question
may
help
to
settle
it
by
which
i
mean
that
it
will
profit
enormously
the
question
of
probability
of
identity
itself
will
by
the
discussion
it
will
create
the
discussion
will
promote
certainty
and
certainty
bender
massively
mused
will
kick
up
a
it
will
kick
up
a
row
hugh
thoroughly
guaranteed
that
you
ll
be
for
the
month
the
man
in
england
if
you
venture
to
remain
here
at
all
except
naturally
poor
lord
whom
it
won
t
be
my
interest
at
the
same
time
to
worry
into
backing
but
whom
it
will
be
exceedingly
to
practise
on
and
hugh
laughed
as
at
the
fun
before
them
if
i
may
entertain
the
sweet
hope
of
success
the
only
thing
is
from
my
point
of
view
he
went
on
that
backing
down
before
what
he
will
call
vulgar
clamour
isn
t
in
the
least
in
his
traditions
nothing
less
so
and
that
if
there
should
be
really
too
much
of
it
for
his
taste
or
his
nerves
he
ll
set
his
handsome
face
as
a
stone
and
never
budge
an
inch
but
at
least
again
what
i
appeal
to
you
for
will
have
taken
place
the
picture
will
have
been
seen
by
a
lot
of
people
who
ll
it
will
have
been
seen
bender
amended
on
the
mere
contingency
of
my
acquisition
of
it
only
if
its
present
owner
consents
hugh
almost
derisively
echoed
why
he
ll
propose
it
himself
he
ll
insist
on
it
he
ll
put
it
through
once
he
s
angry
enough
as
angry
i
mean
as
almost
any
public
criticism
of
a
personal
act
of
his
will
be
sure
to
make
him
and
i
m
afraid
the
striking
criticism
or
at
least
animadversion
of
this
morning
will
have
blown
on
his
flame
of
inevitably
a
student
of
character
bender
rose
to
the
occasion
yes
i
guess
he
s
pretty
they
ve
imputed
to
him
hugh
but
wanted
to
abound
in
that
sense
an
intention
of
which
after
all
he
isn
t
so
that
his
listener
glowed
with
interested
optimism
if
they
don
t
look
out
if
they
impute
it
to
him
again
i
guess
he
ll
just
go
and
be
guilty
hugh
might
at
this
moment
have
shown
to
an
initiated
eye
as
fairly
elated
by
the
sense
of
producing
something
of
the
effect
he
had
hoped
you
entertain
the
fond
vision
of
lashing
them
up
to
that
mistake
oh
fisher
in
troubled
waters
and
then
with
a
finer
art
as
his
companion
expansively
bright
but
crudely
acute
eyed
him
in
turn
as
if
to
sound
the
strongest
thing
in
such
a
type
one
does
make
out
is
his
resentment
of
a
liberty
taken
and
the
most
natural
furthermore
is
quite
that
he
should
feel
almost
anything
you
do
take
uninvited
from
the
groaning
board
of
his
banquet
of
life
to
such
a
bender
participated
thus
at
his
perceptive
ease
in
the
exposed
aristocratic
illusion
yes
i
guess
he
has
always
lived
as
he
likes
the
way
those
of
you
who
have
got
things
fixed
for
them
over
here
and
to
have
to
quit
it
on
account
of
unpleasant
remark
but
he
gave
up
thoughtfully
trying
to
express
what
this
must
be
reduced
to
the
mere
synthetic
interjection
my
that
s
it
bender
hugh
said
for
the
consecration
of
such
a
moral
he
won
t
quit
it
without
a
hard
bender
hereupon
at
last
gave
himself
quite
gaily
away
as
to
his
high
calculation
of
impunity
well
i
guess
he
won
t
struggle
too
hard
for
me
to
hold
on
to
him
if
i
to
in
the
thick
of
the
conflict
then
however
that
may
be
hugh
returned
don
t
forget
what
i
ve
urged
on
you
the
claim
of
our
desolate
but
his
friend
had
an
answer
to
this
my
natural
interest
crimble
considering
what
i
do
for
it
is
in
the
claim
of
ours
but
i
wish
you
were
on
my
side
not
so
much
hugh
hungrily
and
truthfully
laughed
as
i
wish
you
were
on
mine
decidedly
none
the
less
he
had
to
go
for
another
look
here
he
reached
the
doorway
of
the
second
room
where
however
his
companion
freshly
alert
at
this
stayed
him
by
a
gesture
how
much
is
she
really
worth
she
hugh
staring
a
moment
was
miles
at
sea
lady
sandgate
her
a
responsible
answer
was
prevented
the
butler
was
again
with
them
he
had
opened
wide
the
other
door
and
he
named
to
bender
the
personage
under
his
convoy
lord
john
hugh
caught
this
from
the
inner
threshold
and
it
gave
him
his
escape
oh
ask
friend
with
which
he
sought
the
further
passage
to
the
staircase
and
street
while
lord
john
arrived
in
charge
of
gotch
who
having
remarked
to
the
two
occupants
of
the
front
that
her
ladyship
would
come
left
them
together
iv
then
theign
s
not
yet
here
lord
john
had
to
resign
himself
as
he
greeted
his
american
ally
but
he
told
me
i
should
find
he
has
kept
me
waiting
that
gentleman
returned
but
what
s
the
matter
with
him
anyway
the
matter
with
him
lord
john
treated
such
ignorance
as
irritating
must
of
course
be
this
beastly
thing
in
the
bender
proclaimed
on
the
other
hand
his
incapacity
to
seize
such
connections
what
s
the
matter
with
the
beastly
thing
why
aren
t
you
aware
that
the
stiffest
bit
of
it
is
a
regular
dig
at
you
if
you
call
a
regular
dig
you
can
t
have
had
much
experience
of
the
papers
i
ve
known
them
to
dig
much
i
ve
had
experience
of
such
horrid
attacks
thank
goodness
but
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
lord
john
with
the
surprise
of
his
own
delicacy
that
you
don
t
unpleasantly
feel
it
feel
it
where
my
dear
sir
why
god
bless
me
such
impertinence
everywhere
all
over
me
at
once
bender
took
refuge
in
easy
humour
well
i
m
a
large
man
so
when
i
want
to
feel
so
much
i
look
out
for
something
good
but
what
if
he
suffers
from
the
blot
on
his
ermine
ain
t
that
what
you
wear
does
our
friend
propose
to
do
about
it
lord
john
had
a
demur
which
was
immediately
followed
by
the
apprehension
of
support
in
his
uncertainty
lady
sandgate
was
before
them
having
reached
them
through
the
other
room
and
to
her
he
at
once
referred
the
question
what
theign
propose
do
you
think
lady
sandgate
to
do
about
it
she
breathed
both
her
hospitality
and
her
vagueness
to
do
don
t
you
know
about
the
thing
in
the
journal
awfully
offensive
all
round
there
d
be
even
a
little
pinch
for
in
it
bender
said
to
her
if
you
were
bent
on
fitting
the
shoe
well
she
met
it
all
as
gaily
as
was
compatible
with
a
firm
look
at
her
elder
guest
while
she
took
her
place
with
them
oh
the
shoes
of
such
monsters
as
that
are
much
too
big
for
poor
but
she
was
more
specific
for
lord
john
i
know
only
what
grace
has
just
told
me
but
since
it
s
a
question
of
footgear
dear
theign
will
certainly
what
you
may
call
take
his
stand
lord
john
welcomed
this
assurance
if
i
know
him
he
ll
take
it
splendidly
bender
s
attention
was
genial
though
rather
more
detached
and
what
while
he
s
about
it
will
he
take
it
particularly
oh
we
ve
plenty
of
things
thank
heaven
said
lady
sandgate
for
a
man
in
theign
s
position
to
hold
fast
by
lord
john
freely
confirmed
it
scores
and
scores
rather
and
i
will
say
for
us
that
with
the
rotten
way
things
seem
going
the
fact
may
soon
become
a
real
bender
seemed
struck
and
not
unsympathetic
i
see
that
your
system
would
be
rather
a
fraud
if
you
hadn
t
pretty
well
fixed
lady
sandgate
spoke
as
one
at
present
none
the
less
substantially
warned
and
convinced
it
doesn
t
however
alter
the
fact
that
we
ve
thus
in
our
ears
the
first
growl
of
an
ah
lord
john
concurred
we
ve
unmistakably
the
first
growl
of
an
outcry
bender
s
judgment
on
the
matter
paused
at
sight
of
lord
theign
introduced
and
announced
as
lord
john
spoke
by
gotch
but
with
the
result
of
his
addressing
directly
the
person
so
presenting
himself
why
they
tell
me
that
what
this
means
lord
theign
is
the
first
growl
of
an
outcry
the
appearance
of
the
most
eminent
figure
in
the
group
might
have
been
held
in
itself
to
testify
to
some
such
truth
in
the
sense
at
least
that
a
certain
conscious
radiance
a
gathered
light
of
battle
in
his
lordship
s
aspect
would
have
been
explained
by
his
having
taken
the
full
measure
an
inner
success
with
which
he
glowed
of
some
high
provocation
he
was
flushed
but
he
bore
it
as
the
ensign
of
his
house
he
was
so
admirably
vividly
dressed
for
the
morning
hour
and
for
his
journey
that
he
shone
as
with
the
armour
of
a
knight
and
the
whole
effect
of
him
from
head
to
foot
with
every
jerk
of
his
unconcern
and
every
flash
of
his
ease
was
to
call
attention
to
his
being
utterly
unshaken
and
knowing
perfectly
what
he
was
about
it
was
at
this
happy
pitch
that
he
replied
to
the
prime
upsetter
of
his
peace
i
m
afraid
i
don
t
know
what
anything
means
to
bender
but
it
s
exactly
to
find
out
that
i
ve
asked
you
with
our
friend
john
kindly
to
meet
me
here
for
a
very
brief
conference
dear
lady
by
your
good
leave
he
went
on
to
lady
sandgate
at
which
i
m
only
too
pleased
that
you
yourself
should
assist
the
first
growl
of
any
outcry
i
may
mention
to
you
all
affects
me
no
more
than
the
last
will
so
i
m
delighted
to
gather
lady
sandgate
took
him
straight
up
that
you
don
t
let
go
your
inestimable
he
at
first
quite
stared
superior
let
go
but
then
treated
it
with
a
lighter
touch
upon
my
honour
i
might
you
know
that
dose
of
the
daily
press
has
made
me
feel
so
fit
i
arrive
at
any
rate
he
pursued
to
the
others
and
in
particular
to
bender
i
arrive
with
my
decision
taken
which
i
ve
thought
may
perhaps
interest
you
if
that
tuppeny
rot
an
attempt
at
an
outcry
i
simply
nip
it
in
the
lord
john
rejoicingly
approved
absolutely
the
only
way
with
the
least
to
treat
it
lady
sandgate
on
the
other
hand
sounded
a
sceptical
note
but
are
you
sure
it
s
so
easy
theign
to
hush
up
a
noise
it
ain
t
what
i
d
call
a
real
one
lady
sandgate
bender
said
you
can
generally
distinguish
a
real
one
from
the
squeak
of
two
or
three
mice
but
granted
mice
do
affect
you
lord
theign
it
will
interest
me
to
hear
what
sort
of
a
trap
by
what
you
say
you
propose
to
set
for
you
must
allow
me
to
measure
myself
bender
his
lordship
replied
the
importance
of
a
gross
freedom
publicly
used
with
my
absolutely
personal
proceedings
and
affairs
to
the
cause
and
origin
of
any
definite
report
of
which
in
such
circles
i
m
afraid
i
rather
wonder
if
you
yourself
can
t
give
me
a
it
took
bender
a
minute
to
do
justice
to
these
stately
remarks
you
rather
wonder
if
i
ve
talked
of
how
i
feel
about
your
detaining
in
your
hands
my
beautiful
duchess
oh
if
you
ve
already
published
her
as
yours
with
your
of
publication
lord
theign
coldly
laughed
of
course
i
trace
the
connection
benders
acceptance
of
responsibility
clearly
cost
him
no
shade
of
a
pang
why
i
haven
t
for
quite
a
while
talked
of
a
blessed
other
thing
and
i
m
capable
of
growing
more
profane
over
my
getting
her
than
i
guess
any
one
would
dare
to
be
if
i
well
you
ll
certainly
not
get
her
bender
lady
sandgate
as
for
reasons
of
her
own
bravely
trumpeted
and
even
if
there
were
a
chance
of
it
don
t
you
see
that
your
way
wouldn
t
be
publicly
to
abuse
our
noble
friend
bender
but
beamed
in
reply
upon
that
personage
oh
i
guess
our
noble
friend
knows
i
to
talk
big
about
big
things
you
understand
sir
the
scream
of
the
eagle
i
ll
forgive
you
lord
theign
civilly
returned
all
the
big
talk
you
like
if
you
ll
now
understand
my
retort
to
that
hireling
pack
shall
be
at
once
to
dispose
of
a
bender
rather
failed
to
follow
but
that
s
what
you
wanted
to
do
pardon
me
said
his
lordship
i
make
a
difference
it
s
what
you
wanted
me
to
the
mystification
however
continued
and
you
were
as
you
seemed
then
willing
lord
theign
waived
well
i
m
willing
that
s
all
that
need
concern
us
only
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
he
added
with
all
authority
you
can
t
have
our
duchess
you
can
t
have
our
duchess
and
lord
john
as
before
the
altar
of
patriotism
wrapped
it
in
sacrificial
sighs
you
can
t
have
our
duchess
lady
sandgate
repeated
but
with
a
grace
that
took
the
sting
from
her
triumph
and
she
seemed
still
all
sweet
sociability
as
she
added
i
wish
he
d
tell
you
too
you
dreadful
rich
thing
that
you
can
t
have
anything
at
all
lord
theign
however
in
the
interest
of
harmony
deprecated
that
rigour
ah
what
then
would
become
of
my
happy
retort
and
what
as
it
bender
asked
becomes
of
my
unhappy
grievance
wouldn
t
a
really
great
capture
make
up
to
you
for
that
well
i
take
more
interest
in
what
i
want
than
in
what
i
have
and
it
depends
don
t
you
see
on
how
you
measure
the
lord
john
had
at
once
in
this
connection
a
bright
idea
shouldn
t
you
like
to
go
back
there
and
take
the
measure
yourself
bender
considered
him
as
through
narrowed
eyelids
look
again
at
that
tottering
moretto
well
its
size
as
you
say
isn
t
in
light
a
negligible
you
mean
that
big
as
it
is
it
hasn
t
yet
stopped
growing
the
question
however
as
he
immediately
showed
resided
in
what
lord
theign
himself
meant
it
s
more
to
the
purpose
he
said
to
bender
that
i
should
mention
to
you
the
leading
feature
or
in
other
words
the
very
essence
of
my
plan
of
campaign
which
is
to
put
the
picture
at
once
on
he
marked
his
idea
with
a
broad
but
elegant
gesture
on
view
as
a
thing
definitely
disposed
i
say
i
say
i
say
cried
lord
john
moved
by
this
bold
stroke
to
high
admiration
lady
sandgate
s
approval
was
more
qualified
but
on
view
dear
theign
how
with
one
of
those
pushing
people
in
bond
and
then
as
for
the
crushing
climax
of
his
policy
as
a
mantovano
pure
and
but
my
dear
man
she
quavered
if
it
one
bender
at
once
anticipated
the
wind
had
suddenly
risen
for
him
and
he
let
out
sail
lady
it
s
going
by
all
that
s
well
interesting
to
one
lord
theign
took
him
up
with
pleasure
you
seize
me
we
it
as
one
lord
john
eagerly
borrowed
the
emphasis
we
it
as
one
bender
meanwhile
fed
with
an
opened
appetite
on
the
thought
he
even
gave
it
back
larger
as
the
number
eight
lord
theign
happily
seized
that
will
be
it
to
a
charm
it
will
make
them
bender
asked
madder
than
anything
his
patron
if
not
his
client
put
it
more
nobly
it
will
markedly
affirm
my
which
will
in
turn
the
more
markedly
create
it
may
create
all
it
will
well
if
don
t
mind
it
don
t
bender
concluded
but
though
bathed
in
this
high
serenity
he
was
all
for
the
rapid
application
of
it
elsewhere
you
ll
put
the
thing
on
view
right
off
as
soon
as
the
proper
arrangement
you
put
off
your
journey
to
it
lady
at
once
broke
in
lord
theign
bethought
himself
with
the
effect
of
a
gracious
confidence
in
the
others
not
if
these
friends
will
oh
i
guess
we
ll
bender
declared
ah
we
though
lord
john
you
understand
then
i
have
an
interest
bender
went
on
to
lord
theign
his
lordship
s
irony
met
it
i
accept
that
complication
which
so
much
simplifies
and
yet
also
have
a
liberty
where
else
would
be
those
you
ve
taken
the
point
is
said
lord
theign
that
have
a
it
settled
bender
then
i
ll
your
he
snatched
up
his
hat
lord
john
come
right
round
lord
john
had
of
himself
reached
the
door
which
he
opened
to
let
the
whirlwind
tremendously
figured
by
his
friend
pass
out
first
taking
leave
of
the
others
he
gave
it
even
his
applause
the
fellow
can
do
anything
anywhere
and
he
hastily
followed
v
lady
sandgate
left
alone
with
lord
theign
drew
the
line
at
their
companion
s
enthusiasm
that
may
be
true
of
bender
for
it
s
dreadful
how
he
bears
one
down
but
i
simply
find
him
a
well
said

friend
who
seemed
disposed
not
to
fatigue
the
question
i
dare
say
a
terror
will
help
he
had
other
business
to
which
he
at
once
gave
himself
and
now
if
you
please
for
that
i
ll
send
her
to
you
she
replied
if
you
can
t
stay
to
i
ve
three
or
four
things
to
do
he
pleaded
and
i
lunch
with
kitty
at
she
submitted
in
that
case
but
disappointedly
with
berkeley
square
then
you
ve
time
but
i
confess
i
don
t
quite
grasp
the
so
odd
inspiration
that
you
ve
set
those
men
to
carry
he
showed
surprise
and
regret
but
even
greater
decision
then
it
needn
t
trouble
you
dear
it
s
enough
that
i
myself
go
are
you
so
very
convinced
it
s
straight
she
wouldn
t
be
a
bore
to
him
but
she
couldn
t
not
be
a
blessing
what
in
the
world
else
is
it
he
asked
when
having
good
reasons
one
acts
on
em
you
must
have
an
immense
array
she
sighed
to
fly
so
in
the
face
of
opinion
opinion
he
commented
i
fly
in
its
face
why
the
vulgar
thing
as
i
m
taking
my
quiet
walk
flies
in
mine
i
give
it
a
whack
with
my
umbrella
and
send
it
about
its
to
which
he
added
with
more
reproach
it
s
enough
to
have
been
dished
by
grace
without
falling
away
sadly
and
sweetly
she
defended
herself
it
s
only
my
great
affection
and
all
that
these
years
have
been
for
us
it
is
that
make
me
wish
you
weren
t
so
i
ve
a
perfect
sense
my
dear
of
what
these
years
have
been
for
us
a
very
charming
matter
but
proud
is
it
you
find
me
of
the
daughter
who
does
her
best
to
ruin
me
or
of
the
one
who
does
her
best
to
humiliate
lady
sandgate
not
undiscernibly
took
her
choice
of
ignoring
the
point
of
this
your
surrenders
to
kitty
are
your
own
affair
but
are
you
sure
you
can
really
bear
to
see
grace
i
seem
expected
indeed
to
bear
much
he
said
with
more
and
more
of
his
parental
bitterness
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
m
yet
in
a
funk
before
my
child
doesn
t
she
to
see
me
with
any
contrition
after
the
trick
she
has
played
me
and
then
as
his
companion
s
answer
failed
in
spite
of
which
trick
you
suggest
that
i
should
leave
the
country
with
no
sign
of
her
explaining
his
hostess
raised
her
head
she
does
want
to
see
you
i
know
but
you
must
recall
the
sequel
to
that
bad
hour
at
dedborough
when
it
was
you
who
declined
to
see
before
she
left
the
house
with
you
the
next
day
for
this
he
was
entirely
reminiscent
what
i
recall
is
that
even
if
i
had
condoned
that
evening
her
deception
of
in
my
folly
i
still
loathed
for
my
friend
s
sake
her
practical
joke
on
poor
lady
sandgate
indulged
in
the
shrug
conciliatory
it
was
your
very
complaint
that
your
own
appeal
to
her
an
appeal
from
yes
he
returned
so
well
he
remembered
she
was
about
as
civil
to
me
then
picking
a
quarrel
with
me
on
such
a
ground
as
that
devil
of
a
fellow
in
the
newspaper
the
taste
of
whose
elegant
remarks
for
that
matter
she
must
now
altogether
enjoy
his
good
friend
showily
balanced
and
might
have
been
about
to
reply
with
weight
but
what
she
in
fact
brought
out
was
only
i
see
you
re
right
about
it
i
must
let
her
speak
for
that
i
shall
greatly
prefer
to
her
speaking
as
she
did
so
extraordinarily
out
of
the
blue
at
dedborough
upon
my
honour
for
the
wonderful
friends
she
picks
up
the
introduced
by
her
what
was
his
name
who
regularly
cheeked
me
as
i
suppose
he
d
call
it
in
my
own
house
and
whom
i
hope
by
the
way
that
under
this
roof
she
s
not
able
to
be
quite
so
thick
with
if
lady
sandgate
winced
at
that
vain
dream
she
managed
not
to
betray
it
and
she
had
in
any
embarrassment
on
this
matter
the
support
as
we
know
of
her
own
tried
policy
she
leads
her
life
under
this
roof
very
much
as
under
yours
and
she
s
not
of
an
age
remember
for
me
to
pretend
either
to
watch
her
movements
or
to
control
her
leaving
him
however
thus
to
perform
his
pleasure
the
charming
woman
had
before
she
went
an
abrupt
change
of
tone
whatever
your
relations
with
others
dear
friend
don
t
forget
that
still
lord
theign
accepted
the
reminder
though
the
circumstances
being
such
it
scarce
moved
him
to
ecstasy
that
you
re
here
thank
heaven
is
of
course
a
comfort
or
would
be
if
you
ah
she
submissively
sighed
if
i
don
t
always
understand
a
spirit
so
much
higher
than
mine
and
a
situation
so
much
more
complicated
certainly
i
at
least
always
defer
i
at
least
always
well
what
can
i
say
but
worship
and
then
as
he
remained
not
other
than
finely
passive
the
old
altar
theign
she
went
on
and
a
spark
of
the
old
fire
he
had
not
looked
at
her
on
this
it
was
as
if
he
shrank
with
his
preoccupations
from
a
tender
passage
but
he
let
her
take
his
left
hand
so
i
feel
he
was
however
kind
enough
to
answer
do
feel
she
returned
with
much
concentration
she
raised
the
hand
to
her
pressed
lips
dropped
it
and
with
a
rich
reached
the
threshold
of
the
other
room
may
i
smoke
he
asked
before
she
had
disappeared
dear
yes
he
had
meanwhile
taken
out
his
cigarette
case
and
was
looking
about
for
a
match
but
something
else
occurred
to
him
you
must
come
to
rather
she
said
with
intensity
and
with
that
she
passed
away
vi
left
alone
he
had
a
moment
s
meditation
where
he
stood
it
found
issue
in
an
articulate
poor
dear
thing
an
exclamation
marked
at
once
with
patience
and
impatience
with
resignation
and
ridicule
after
which
waiting
for
his
daughter
lord
theign
slowly
and
absently
roamed
finding
matches
at
last
and
lighting
his
cigarette
all
with
an
air
of
concern
that
had
settled
on
him
more
heavily
from
the
moment
of
his
finding
himself
alone
his
luxury
of
gloom
if
gloom
it
was
dropped
however
on
his
taking
heed
of
lady
grace
who
arriving
on
the
scene
through
the
other
room
had
had
just
time
to
stand
and
watch
him
in
silence
oh
he
jerked
out
at
sight
of
her
which
she
had
to
content
herself
with
as
a
parental
greeting
after
separation
his
next
words
doing
little
to
qualify
its
dryness
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
know
i
m
within
a
couple
of
hours
of
leaving
england
under
a
necessity
of
and
then
as
drawing
nearer
she
signified
without
speaking
her
possession
of
this
fact
i
ve
thought
accordingly
that
before
i
go
i
should
on
this
first
possible
occasion
since
that
odious
occurrence
at
dedborough
like
to
leave
you
a
little
more
food
for
meditation
in
my
absence
on
the
painfully
false
position
in
which
you
there
placed
he
carried
himself
restlessly
even
perhaps
with
a
shade
of
awkwardness
to
which
her
stillness
was
a
contrast
she
just
waited
wholly
passive
possibly
indeed
a
trifle
portentous
if
you
had
plotted
and
planned
it
in
advance
he
none
the
less
firmly
pursued
if
you
had
acted
from
some
uncanny
or
malignant
motive
you
couldn
t
have
arranged
more
perfectly
to
incommode
to
disconcert
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
make
light
of
me
and
insult
even
before
this
charge
she
made
no
sign
with
her
eyes
now
attached
to
the
ground
she
let
him
proceed
i
had
practically
guaranteed
to
our
excellent
our
charming
friend
your
favourable
view
of
his
appeal
which
you
yourself
too
remember
had
left
him
in
so
little
doubt
of
so
that
having
by
your
performance
so
egregiously
failed
him
i
have
the
pleasure
of
their
coming
down
on
me
for
explanations
for
compensations
and
for
god
knows
what
lady
grace
looking
up
at
last
left
him
in
no
doubt
of
the
rigour
of
her
attention
i
m
sorry
indeed
father
to
have
done
you
any
wrong
but
may
i
ask
whom
in
such
a
connection
you
refer
to
as
they
they
he
echoed
in
the
manner
of
a
man
who
has
had
handed
back
to
his
more
careful
eye
across
the
counter
some
questionable
coin
that
he
has
tried
to
pass
why
your
own
sister
to
begin
with
whose
interest
in
what
may
make
for
your
happiness
i
suppose
you
decently
recognise
and
people
one
and
all
the
delightful
old
duchess
in
particular
who
only
wanted
to
be
charming
to
you
and
who
are
as
good
people
and
as
pleasant
and
as
clever
damn
it
when
all
s
said
and
done
as
any
others
that
are
likely
to
come
your
it
clearly
did
his
lordship
good
to
work
out
thus
his
case
which
grew
more
and
more
coherent
to
him
and
glowed
with
irresistible
colour
letting
alone
gallant
john
himself
most
amiable
of
men
about
whose
merits
and
whose
claims
you
appear
to
have
pretended
to
agree
with
me
just
that
you
might
when
he
presumed
poor
chap
ardently
to
urge
them
deal
him
with
the
more
cruel
effect
that
calculated
blow
on
the
mouth
it
was
clear
that
in
the
girl
s
great
gravity
embarrassment
had
no
share
they
so
come
down
on
you
i
understand
then
father
that
you
re
obliged
to
come
down
on
assuredly
for
some
better
satisfaction
than
your
just
moping
here
without
a
sign
but
a
sign
of
what
father
she
asked
as
helpless
as
a
lone
islander
scanning
the
horizon
for
a
sail
of
your
appreciating
of
your
in
some
degree
dutifully
considering
the
predicament
into
which
you
ve
put
me
hasn
t
it
occurred
to
you
in
the
least
that
you
ve
rather
put
into
one
he
threw
back
his
head
as
from
exasperated
nerves
i
put
you
certainly
in
the
predicament
of
your
receiving
by
my
care
a
handsome
settlement
in
life
which
all
the
elements
that
would
make
for
your
enjoying
it
had
every
appearance
of
successfully
commending
to
the
perfect
readiness
of
which
on
his
lips
had
like
a
higher
wave
the
virtue
of
lifting
and
dropping
him
to
still
more
tangible
ground
and
if
i
understand
you
aright
as
wishing
to
know
whether
i
apologise
for
that
zeal
why
you
take
a
most
preposterous
view
of
our
relation
as
father
and
you
understand
me
no
better
than
i
fear
i
understand
you
lady
grace
returned
if
what
you
expect
of
me
is
really
to
take
back
my
words
to
lord
and
then
as
he
didn
t
answer
while
their
breach
gaped
like
a
jostled
wound
have
you
seriously
come
to
propose
and
from
again
she
added
that
i
shall
reconsider
my
resolute
act
and
lend
myself
to
your
beautiful
arrangement
it
had
so
the
sound
of
unmixed
ridicule
that
he
could
only
for
his
dignity
not
give
way
to
passion
i
ve
come
above
all
for
i
may
say
grace
to
remind
you
of
whom
you
re
addressing
when
you
jibe
at
me
and
to
make
of
you
assuredly
a
plain
demand
exactly
as
to
whether
you
judged
us
to
have
actively
your
treatment
of
our
unhappy
friend
to
have
brought
it
upon
us
he
and
i
by
my
refusal
to
discuss
with
you
at
such
a
crisis
the
question
of
my
disposition
of
a
particular
item
of
my
property
i
ve
only
to
look
at
you
for
that
matter
lord
theign
continued
always
with
a
finer
point
and
a
higher
consistency
as
his
rehearsal
of
his
wrongs
broadened
to
have
my
inquiry
as
it
seems
to
me
eloquently
answered
you
flounced
away
from
poor
john
you
took
as
he
tells
me
his
head
off
just
to
repay
me
for
what
you
chose
to
regard
as
my
snub
on
the
score
of
your
challenging
my
entertainment
of
a
possible
purchaser
a
rebuke
launched
at
me
practically
in
the
presence
of
a
most
inferior
person
a
stranger
and
an
intruder
from
whom
you
had
all
the
air
of
taking
your
cue
for
naming
me
the
great
condition
on
which
you
d
gratify
my
hope
am
i
to
understand
in
other
words
and
his
lordship
mounted
to
a
climax
that
you
sent
us
about
our
business
because
i
failed
to
gratify
hope
that
of
my
knocking
under
to
your
sudden
monstrous
pretension
to
lay
down
the
law
for
my
choice
of
ways
and
means
of
raising
to
my
best
convenience
a
considerable
sum
of
money
you
ll
be
so
good
as
to
understand
once
for
all
that
i
recognise
there
no
right
of
interference
from
any
quarter
and
also
to
let
that
knowledge
govern
your
behaviour
in
my
lady
grace
had
thus
for
some
minutes
waited
on
his
words
waited
even
as
almost
with
anxiety
for
the
safe
conduct
he
might
look
to
from
some
of
the
more
extravagant
of
them
but
he
at
least
felt
at
the
end
if
it
was
an
end
all
he
owed
them
so
that
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
accept
as
achieved
his
dreadful
felicity
you
re
very
angry
with
me
and
i
hope
you
won
t
feel
me
simply
aggravating
if
i
say
that
thinking
everything
over
i
ve
done
my
best
to
allow
for
that
but
i
answer
your
question
if
i
do
answer
it
by
saying
that
my
discovery
of
your
possible
sacrifice
of
one
of
our
most
beautiful
things
didn
t
predispose
me
to
decide
in
favour
of
a
person
however
backed
by
you
for
whose
benefit
the
sacrifice
was
to
take
place
frankly
the
girl
pushed
on
i
did
quite
hate
for
the
moment
everything
that
might
make
for
such
a
mistake
and
took
the
darkest
view
let
me
also
confess
of
every
one
without
exception
connected
with
it
i
interceded
with
you
earnestly
for
our
precious
picture
and
you
wouldn
t
on
any
terms
my
intercession
on
top
of
that
lord
john
blundered
in
without
timeliness
or
tact
and
i
m
afraid
that
as
i
hadn
t
been
the
least
in
love
with
him
even
before
he
did
have
to
take
the
lord
theign
with
an
elated
swing
of
his
person
greeted
this
as
all
he
could
possibly
want
you
recognise
then
that
your
reception
of
him
purely
vindictive
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
unless
my
conduct
of
my
private
interests
of
which
you
know
nothing
whatever
happens
to
square
with
your
superior
wisdom
you
ll
put
me
under
boycott
all
round
while
you
chatter
about
mistakes
and
blunders
and
about
our
charming
friend
s
lack
of
the
discretion
of
which
you
yourself
set
so
grand
an
example
what
account
have
you
to
offer
of
the
scene
you
made
me
there
before
that
fellow
your
confederate
as
he
had
all
the
air
of
being
by
giving
it
me
with
such
effrontery
that
if
i
had
eminently
done
with
him
after
his
remarkable
display
you
at
least
were
but
the
more
determined
to
see
him
keep
it
up
the
girl
s
justification
clearly
was
very
present
to
her
and
not
less
obviously
the
truth
that
to
make
it
strong
she
must
avoiding
every
keep
it
very
simple
the
only
account
i
can
give
you
i
think
is
that
i
could
but
speak
at
such
a
moment
as
i
felt
and
that
i
felt
well
how
can
i
say
how
deeply
if
you
can
really
bear
to
know
i
feel
so
still
i
care
in
fact
more
than
ever
that
we
shouldn
t
do
such
things
i
care
if
you
like
to
indiscretion
i
care
if
you
like
to
offence
to
arrogance
to
folly
but
even
as
my
last
word
to
you
before
you
leave
england
on
the
conclusion
of
such
a
step
i
m
ready
to
cry
out
to
you
that
you
oughtn
t
you
oughtn
t
you
oughtn
t
her
father
with
elevated
brows
and
high
commanding
hand
checked
her
as
in
an
act
really
of
violence
save
that
like
an
inflamed
young
priestess
she
had
already
in
essence
delivered
her
message
hallo
hallo
hallo
my
distracted
daughter
no
crying
out
if
you
please
after
which
while
arrested
but
unabashed
she
still
kept
her
lighted
eyes
on
him
he
gave
back
her
conscious
stare
for
a
minute
inwardly
and
rapidly
turning
things
over
making
connections
taking
as
after
some
long
and
lamentable
lapse
of
observation
a
new
strange
measure
of
her
all
to
the
upshot
of
his
then
speaking
with
a
difference
of
tone
a
recognition
of
still
more
of
the
odious
than
he
had
supposed
so
that
the
case
might
really
call
for
some
coolness
you
keep
bad
company
grace
it
pays
the
devil
with
your
sense
of
proportion
if
you
make
this
row
when
i
sell
a
picture
what
will
be
left
to
you
when
i
forge
a
cheque
if
you
had
arrived
at
the
necessity
of
forging
a
cheque
she
answered
i
should
then
resign
myself
to
that
of
your
selling
a
but
not
short
of
that
not
short
of
that
not
one
of
but
i
couldn
t
said
his
lordship
with
his
best
and
coldest
amusement
sell
one
of
somebody
else
s
she
was
however
not
disconcerted
other
people
do
other
things
they
appear
to
have
done
them
and
to
be
doing
them
all
about
us
but
have
been
so
decently
different
always
and
ever
we
ve
never
done
anything
disloyal
he
was
more
largely
amazed
and
even
interested
now
lady
grace
stuck
to
her
word
that
s
what
it
seems
to
it
seems
to
you
and
his
sarcasm
here
was
easy
more
disloyal
to
sell
a
picture
than
to
buy
one
because
we
didn
t
paint
em
all
ourselves
you
know
she
threw
up
impatient
hands
i
don
t
ask
you
either
to
paint
or
to
buy
oh
a
mercy
he
interrupted
riding
his
irony
hard
and
i
m
glad
to
hear
you
at
least
let
me
off
efforts
however
if
it
strikes
you
as
gracefully
filial
to
apply
to
your
father
s
conduct
so
invidious
a
word
he
went
on
less
scathingly
you
must
take
from
him
in
your
turn
his
quite
other
view
of
what
makes
disloyalty
understanding
distinctly
by
the
same
token
that
he
enjoins
on
you
not
to
give
an
odious
illustration
of
it
while
he
s
away
by
discussing
and
deploring
with
any
of
your
extraordinary
friends
any
aspect
or
feature
whatever
of
his
walk
and
conversation
that
pressed
as
i
am
for
time
he
went
on
with
a
glance
at
his
watch
while
she
remained
silent
is
the
main
sense
of
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
so
that
i
count
on
your
perfect
conformity
when
you
have
told
me
that
i
so
count
and
casting
about
for
his
hat
he
espied
it
and
went
to
take
it
up
i
shall
more
cordially
bid
you
his
daughter
looked
as
if
she
had
been
for
some
time
expecting
the
law
thus
imposed
upon
her
had
been
seeing
where
he
must
come
out
but
in
spite
of
this
preparation
she
made
him
wait
for
his
reply
in
such
tension
as
he
had
himself
created
to
kitty
i
ve
practically
said
nothing
and
she
herself
can
tell
you
why
i
ve
in
fact
scarcely
seen
her
this
fortnight
putting
aside
then
amy
sandgate
the
only
person
to
whom
i
ve
spoken
of
your
sacrifice
as
i
suppose
you
ll
let
me
call
it
is
hugh
crimble
whom
you
talk
of
as
my
confederate
at
lord
theign
recovered
the
name
with
relief
mr
hugh
crimble
that
s
it
whom
you
so
amazingly
caused
to
be
present
and
apparently
invited
to
be
active
at
a
business
that
so
little
concerned
he
certainly
took
upon
himself
to
be
interested
as
i
had
hoped
he
would
but
it
was
because
i
had
taken
upon
self
to
act
yes
lord
theign
broke
in
with
the
grossest
want
of
delicacy
well
it
s
from
that
exactly
that
you
ll
now
forbear
and
interested
as
he
may
be
for
which
i
m
deucedly
obliged
to
him
you
ll
not
speak
to
crimble
never
again
the
girl
put
it
as
for
full
certitude
never
of
the
question
that
i
thus
exclude
you
may
chatter
your
fill
said
his
lordship
curtly
about
any
why
the
particular
question
you
forbid
grace
returned
with
great
force
but
as
if
saying
something
very
reasonable
that
question
is
question
we
care
about
it
s
our
very
ground
of
then
her
father
decreed
your
conversation
will
please
to
with
a
ground
or
you
ll
perhaps
better
still
if
that
s
the
only
way
dispense
with
your
lady
grace
took
a
moment
as
if
to
examine
this
more
closely
you
require
of
me
not
to
communicate
with
crimble
at
all
most
assuredly
i
require
it
since
it
s
to
that
you
insist
on
reducing
he
didn
t
look
reduced
the
master
of
dedborough
as
he
spoke
which
was
doubtless
precisely
because
he
held
his
head
so
high
to
affirm
what
he
suffered
is
it
so
essential
to
your
comfort
he
demanded
to
hear
him
or
to
make
him
abuse
me
abusing
you
father
dear
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
his
daughter
had
fairly
lapsed
with
a
despairing
gesture
to
the
tenderness
involved
in
her
compassion
for
his
perversity
we
look
at
the
thing
in
a
much
larger
way
she
pursued
not
heeding
that
she
drew
from
him
a
sound
of
scorn
for
her
it
s
of
our
treasure
itself
we
talk
and
of
what
can
be
in
such
cases
though
with
a
close
application
i
admit
to
the
case
that
you
ah
lord
theign
asked
as
with
absurd
curiosity
i
embody
a
case
wonderfully
father
as
you
do
everything
and
it
s
the
fact
of
its
being
exceptional
she
explained
that
makes
it
so
difficult
to
deal
his
lordship
had
a
gape
for
it
to
deal
with
you
re
undertaking
to
deal
with
me
she
smiled
more
frankly
now
as
for
a
rift
in
the
gloom
well
how
can
we
help
it
if
you
be
a
case
and
then
as
her
tone
but
visibly
darkened
his
wonder
what
we
ve
set
our
hearts
on
is
saving
the
what
you
ve
set
your
hearts
on
in
other
words
is
working
straight
against
me
but
she
persisted
without
heat
what
we
ve
set
our
hearts
on
is
working
for
and
pray
who
in
the
world
s
england
he
cried
in
his
stupefaction
unless
i
am
dear
dear
father
she
pleaded
that
s
all
we
you
to
be
i
mean
she
didn
t
fear
firmly
to
force
it
home
in
the
real
the
right
the
grand
sense
the
sense
that
you
see
is
so
intensely
ours
he
couldn
t
but
again
throw
back
her
word
at
her
isn
t
it
damn
you
just
ours
no
no
she
interrupted
not
in
she
smiled
at
him
still
though
it
was
strained
as
if
he
really
ought
to
perceive
but
he
glared
as
at
a
senseless
juggle
what
and
who
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
what
are
we
the
whole
blest
lot
of
us
pray
but
the
best
and
most
english
thing
in
the
country
people
walking
and
riding
straight
doing
disinterestedly
most
of
the
difficult
and
all
the
thankless
jobs
minding
their
own
business
above
all
and
expecting
others
to
mind
theirs
so
he
let
her
have
the
stout
sound
truth
as
it
were
and
so
the
direct
force
of
it
clearly
might
by
his
view
have
made
her
reel
you
and
i
my
lady
and
your
two
decent
brothers
god
be
thanked
for
them
and
mine
into
the
bargain
and
all
the
rest
the
jolly
lot
of
us
take
us
together
make
us
numerous
enough
without
any
foreign
aid
or
mixture
if
that
s
what
i
understand
you
to
mean
you
don
t
understand
me
at
all
evidently
and
above
all
i
see
you
don
t
want
to
she
had
the
bravery
to
add
by
our
sense
of
what
s
due
to
the
nation
in
such
a
case
i
mean
crimble
s
and
mine
and
nobody
s
else
at
all
since
as
i
tell
you
it
s
only
with
him
i
ve
it
gave
him
then
every
inch
of
him
showed
the
full
the
grotesque
measure
of
the
scandal
he
faced
so
that
you
and
crimble
represent
the
standard
for
me
in
your
opinion
of
the
proprieties
and
duties
of
our
house
well
she
was
too
earnest
as
she
clearly
wished
to
let
him
see
to
mind
his
perversion
of
it
i
express
to
you
the
way
we
it
s
most
striking
to
hear
certainly
what
you
express
he
had
positively
to
laugh
for
it
and
you
speak
of
him
with
your
insufferable
we
as
if
you
were
presenting
him
as
your
god
knows
what
you
ve
enjoyed
a
large
exchange
of
ideas
i
gather
to
have
arrived
at
such
and
then
as
if
to
fall
into
no
trap
he
might
somehow
be
laying
for
her
she
dropped
all
eagerness
and
rebutted
nothing
you
must
see
a
great
deal
of
your
not
to
be
able
to
speak
of
yourself
without
him
yes
we
re
father
she
accepted
this
opening
i
perfectly
adopt
your
but
it
took
her
a
minute
to
go
further
i
saw
here
half
an
hour
saw
him
here
lord
theign
amazedly
asked
he
to
you
here
and
amy
sandgate
has
been
silent
it
wasn
t
her
business
to
tell
you
since
you
see
she
could
leave
it
to
me
and
i
quite
expect
lady
grace
then
produced
that
he
ll
come
it
brought
down
with
a
bang
all
her
father
s
authority
then
i
simply
exact
of
you
that
you
don
t
see
the
pause
of
which
she
paid
it
the
deference
was
charged
like
a
brimming
cup
is
that
what
you
meant
by
your
condition
just
now
that
when
i
do
see
him
i
shall
not
speak
to
him
what
i
really
meant
is
what
i
really
mean
that
you
bow
to
the
law
i
lay
upon
you
and
drop
the
man
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
at
all
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
at
in
fact
she
took
it
in
give
him
wholly
he
had
an
impatient
gesture
you
sound
as
if
i
asked
you
to
give
up
a
fortune
and
then
though
she
had
phrased
his
idea
without
consternation
verily
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
balance
for
her
he
might
have
been
moved
by
something
that
gathered
in
her
eyes
you
re
so
wrapped
up
in
him
that
the
precious
sacrifice
is
like
sort
of
thing
lady
grace
took
her
time
but
showed
as
her
eyes
continued
to
hold
him
what
gathered
i
like
crimble
exceedingly
father
i
think
him
clever
intelligent
good
i
want
what
he
wants
i
want
it
i
think
really
as
much
and
i
don
t
at
all
deny
that
he
has
helped
to
make
me
so
want
it
but
that
doesn
t
matter
i
ll
wholly
cease
to
see
him
i
ll
give
him
up
forever
if
if
she
faltered
however
she
hung
fire
with
a
smile
that
anxiously
intensely
appealed
then
she
began
and
stopped
again
if
if
while
her
father
caught
her
up
with
irritation
if
my
lady
if
please
if
you
ll
withdraw
the
offer
of
our
picture
to
bender
and
never
make
another
to
any
one
else
he
stood
staring
as
at
the
size
of
it
then
translated
it
into
his
own
terms
if
i
ll
obligingly
announce
to
the
world
that
i
ve
made
an
ass
of
myself
you
ll
kindly
forbear
from
your
united
effort
the
charming
pair
of
you
to
show
me
up
for
one
lady
grace
as
if
consciously
not
caring
or
attempting
to
answer
this
simply
gave
the
first
flare
of
his
criticism
time
to
drop
it
wasn
t
till
a
minute
passed
that
she
said
you
don
t
agree
to
my
compromise
ah
the
question
but
fatally
sharpened
at
a
stroke
the
stiffness
of
his
spirit
good
god
i
m
to
compromise
on
top
of
everything
i
m
to
let
you
browbeat
me
haggle
and
bargain
with
me
over
a
thing
that
i
m
entitled
to
settle
with
you
as
things
have
ever
settled
among
us
by
uttering
to
you
my
last
parental
word
you
don
t
care
enough
then
for
what
you
name
she
took
it
up
as
scarce
heeding
now
what
he
said
for
putting
an
end
to
your
odious
commerce
i
give
you
the
measure
on
the
contrary
said
lord
theign
of
how
much
i
care
as
you
give
me
very
strangely
indeed
it
strikes
me
that
of
what
it
costs
you
but
his
other
words
were
lost
in
the
hard
long
look
at
her
from
which
he
broke
off
in
turn
as
for
disgust
it
was
with
an
effect
of
decently
shielding
herself
the
unuttered
meaning
came
so
straight
that
she
substituted
words
of
her
own
of
what
it
costs
me
to
redeem
the
picture
to
lose
your
friend
he
spoke
without
scruple
now
she
instantly
broke
into
ardent
deprecation
pleading
at
once
and
warning
father
father
oh
you
hold
the
thing
in
your
he
pulled
up
before
her
again
as
to
thrust
the
responsibility
straight
back
my
orders
then
are
so
much
rubbish
to
you
lady
grace
held
her
ground
and
they
remained
face
to
face
in
opposition
and
accusation
neither
making
the
other
the
sign
of
peace
but
the
girl
at
least
in
her
way
held
out
the
while
lord
theign
had
but
reaffirmed
his
will
it
was
for
her
acceptance
of
this
that
he
searched
her
her
last
word
not
having
yet
come
before
it
had
done
so
however
the
door
from
the
lobby
opened
and
gotch
had
regained
their
presence
this
appeared
to
determine
in
lady
grace
a
view
of
the
importance
of
delay
which
she
signified
to
her
companion
in
a
well
i
must
think
for
the
butler
positively
resounded
and
hugh
was
there
mr
crimble
gotch
proclaimed
with
the
further
extravagance
of
projecting
the
visitor
straight
upon
his
lordship
vii
our
young
man
showed
another
face
than
the
face
his
friend
had
lately
seen
him
carry
off
and
he
now
turned
it
distressfully
from
that
source
of
inspiration
to
lord
theign
who
was
flagrantly
even
from
this
first
moment
no
such
source
at
all
and
then
from
his
noble
adversary
back
again
under
pressure
of
difficulty
and
effort
to
lady
grace
whom
he
directly
addressed
here
i
am
again
you
see
and
i
ve
got
my
news
worse
luck
but
his
manner
to
her
father
was
the
next
instant
more
brisk
i
learned
you
were
here
my
lord
but
as
the
case
is
important
i
told
them
it
was
all
right
and
came
up
i
ve
been
to
my
club
he
added
for
the
girl
and
found
the
tiresome
thing
but
he
broke
down
breathless
and
it
isn
t
good
she
cried
with
the
highest
concern
ruefully
yet
not
abjectly
he
confessed
not
so
good
as
i
hoped
for
i
assure
you
my
lord
i
counted
it
s
the
report
from
pappendick
about
the
picture
at
verona
lady
grace
interruptingly
explained
hugh
took
it
up
but
as
we
should
well
have
seen
under
embarrassment
dismally
deeper
the
ugly
particular
defeat
he
had
to
announce
showing
thus
in
his
thought
for
a
more
awkward
force
than
any
reviving
possibilities
that
he
might
have
begun
to
balance
against
them
the
man
i
told
about
also
he
said
to
his
formidable
patron
whom
i
went
to
brussels
to
talk
with
and
who
most
kindly
has
gone
for
us
to
verona
he
has
been
able
to
get
straight
at
mantovano
but
the
brute
horribly
wires
me
that
he
doesn
t
quite
see
the
thing
see
i
mean
and
he
gathered
his
two
hearers
together
now
in
his
overflow
of
chagrin
conscious
with
his
break
of
the
ice
more
exclusively
of
that
my
vivid
vital
point
the
absolute
screaming
identity
of
the
two
persons
represented
i
still
hold
he
persuasively
went
on
that
our
man
is
their
man
but
pappendick
decides
that
he
isn
t
and
as
pappendick
has
so
to
be
reckoned
with
of
course
i
m
awfully
lord
theign
had
remained
what
he
had
begun
by
being
immeasurably
and
inaccessibly
detached
only
with
his
curiosity
more
moved
than
he
could
help
and
as
on
second
thought
to
see
what
sort
of
a
still
more
offensive
fool
the
heated
youth
would
really
make
of
himself
yes
you
seem
indeed
remarkably
abashed
hugh
clearly
was
thrown
again
by
the
cold
cut
of
this
colder
than
any
mere
social
ignoring
upon
a
sense
of
the
damnably
poor
figure
he
did
offer
so
that
while
he
straightened
himself
and
kept
a
mastery
of
his
manner
and
a
control
of
his
reply
we
should
yet
have
felt
his
cheek
tingle
i
backed
my
own
judgment
strongly
i
know
and
i
ve
got
my
snub
but
i
don
t
in
the
least
knock
only
the
first
authority
in
europe
doesn
t
care
i
suppose
whether
you
do
or
not
he
isn
t
first
authority
in
europe
thank
god
the
young
man
returned
though
he
is
i
admit
one
of
the
three
or
four
first
and
i
mean
to
appeal
i
ve
another
shot
in
my
locker
he
went
on
with
his
rather
painfully
forced
smile
to
lady
grace
i
had
already
written
you
see
to
dear
old
bardi
of
milan
she
recognised
it
was
admirably
manifest
the
appeal
of
his
directness
to
her
generosity
awkward
as
their
predicament
was
also
for
her
herself
and
spoke
to
him
as
she
might
have
spoken
without
her
father
s
presence
it
would
have
shown
for
beautiful
on
the
spot
had
there
been
any
one
to
perceive
it
that
he
devoutly
recorded
her
intelligence
you
know
of
him
how
delightful
of
you
for
the
italians
i
now
feel
he
quickly
explained
he
must
have
the
instinct
and
it
has
come
over
me
since
that
he
d
have
been
more
our
man
besides
of
course
his
so
knowing
the
verona
she
had
fairly
hung
on
his
lips
but
does
he
know
ours
no
not
ours
yet
that
is
he
consciously
and
quickly
took
himself
up
not
yours
but
as
went
to
verona
for
us
i
ve
asked
bardi
to
do
us
the
great
favour
to
come
here
if
lord
theign
will
be
so
good
he
said
bethinking
himself
with
a
turn
as
to
let
him
examine
the
he
faced
again
to
the
personage
he
mentioned
who
simply
standing
off
and
watching
in
concentrated
interest
as
well
as
detachment
this
interview
of
his
cool
daughter
and
her
still
cooler
guest
had
plainly
elected
as
it
were
to
give
them
rope
to
hang
themselves
staring
very
hard
at
hugh
he
met
his
appeal
but
in
a
silence
clearly
calculated
against
which
however
the
young
man
bearing
up
made
such
head
as
he
could
he
offered
his
next
word
that
is
equally
to
the
two
companions
it
s
not
at
all
impossible
for
such
curious
effects
have
been
that
the
dedborough
picture
seen
the
verona
will
point
a
different
moral
from
the
verona
seen
after
the
and
so
awfully
after
wasn
t
it
lady
grace
asked
awfully
long
after
it
was
years
ago
that
being
in
this
country
for
such
purposes
was
kindly
admitted
to
your
house
when
none
of
you
were
there
or
at
least
oh
of
course
we
don
t
see
one
she
heroically
kept
it
up
you
don
t
see
every
one
hugh
bravely
laughed
and
that
makes
it
all
the
more
charming
that
you
did
and
that
you
still
do
see
me
i
shall
really
get
bardi
he
pursued
to
go
again
to
verona
the
last
thing
before
coming
here
she
had
guessed
before
he
could
say
it
and
still
she
sustained
it
so
that
he
could
shine
at
her
for
assent
how
happy
they
should
like
so
to
work
for
you
ah
we
re
a
band
of
brothers
he
returned
we
few
we
happy
few
from
country
to
country
to
which
he
added
gaining
more
ease
for
an
eye
at
lord
theign
though
we
do
have
our
little
rubs
and
disputes
like
pappendick
and
me
now
the
thing
you
see
is
the
ripping
of
it
all
since
he
developed
and
explained
for
his
elder
friend
s
benefit
with
pertinacious
cheer
and
an
assurance
superficially
at
least
recovered
when
we
re
really
hit
over
a
case
we
ll
do
almost
anything
in
lady
grace
recklessly
throbbing
in
the
breath
of
it
all
immediately
appropriated
what
her
father
let
alone
it
must
be
so
lovely
to
so
hit
it
does
spoil
one
hugh
laughed
for
milder
joys
of
course
what
i
have
to
consider
is
the
chance
putting
it
at
the
chance
of
bardi
s
own
wet
blanket
but
that
s
again
so
very
small
though
he
pulled
up
with
a
drop
to
the
comparative
dismal
which
he
offered
as
an
almost
familiar
tribute
to
lord
theign
you
ll
retort
upon
me
naturally
that
i
promised
you
the
possibility
of
pappendick
s
veto
would
be
all
on
the
poor
dear
old
basis
you
ll
claim
of
the
wish
father
to
the
thought
well
i
do
wish
to
be
right
as
much
as
i
believe
i
am
only
give
me
time
he
sublimely
insisted
how
can
we
prevent
your
using
it
lady
grace
again
interrupted
or
the
fact
either
that
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
the
thing
he
at
once
pursued
will
always
be
at
the
least
the
greatest
of
morettos
ah
he
cried
so
cheerily
that
there
was
still
a
freedom
in
it
toward
any
it
might
concern
the
worst
sha
n
t
come
to
the
worst
but
the
best
to
the
best
my
conviction
of
which
it
is
that
supports
me
in
the
deep
regret
i
have
to
express
and
he
faced
lord
theign
again
for
any
inconvenience
i
may
have
caused
you
by
my
abortive
undertaking
that
i
vow
here
before
lady
grace
i
will
yet
more
than
make
up
lord
theign
after
the
longest
but
the
blankest
contemplation
of
him
broke
hereupon
for
the
first
time
that
attitude
of
completely
sustained
and
separate
silence
which
he
had
yet
made
compatible
with
his
air
of
having
deeply
noted
every
element
of
the
scene
so
that
it
was
of
this
full
view
his
participation
had
effectively
consisted
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
sir
what
you
re
talking
about
and
he
squarely
turned
his
back
strolling
toward
the
other
room
the
threshold
of
which
he
the
next
moment
had
passed
remaining
scantily
within
however
and
in
sight
of
the
others
not
to
say
of
ourselves
even
though
averted
and
ostensibly
lost
in
some
scrutiny
that
might
have
had
for
its
object
the
great
enshrined
lawrence
there
ensued
upon
his
words
and
movement
a
vivid
mute
passage
the
richest
of
commentaries
between
his
companions
who
deeply
divided
by
the
width
of
the
ample
room
followed
him
with
their
eyes
and
then
used
for
their
own
interchange
these
organs
of
remark
eloquent
now
over
hugh
s
unmistakable
dismissal
at
short
order
on
which
obviously
he
must
at
once
act
lady
grace
s
young
arms
conveyed
to
him
by
a
despairing
contrite
motion
of
surrender
that
she
had
done
for
him
all
she
could
do
in
his
presence
and
that
however
sharply
doubtful
the
result
he
was
to
leave
the
rest
to
herself
they
communicated
thus
the
strenuous
pair
for
their
full
moment
without
speaking
only
with
the
prolonged
the
charged
give
and
take
of
their
gaze
and
it
might
well
have
been
imagined
of
their
passion
hugh
had
for
an
instant
a
show
of
hesitation
of
the
arrested
impulse
while
he
kept
her
father
within
range
to
launch
at
that
personage
before
going
some
final
remonstrance
it
was
the
girl
s
raised
hand
and
gesture
of
warning
that
waved
away
for
him
such
a
mistake
he
decided
under
her
pressure
and
after
a
last
searching
and
answering
look
at
her
reached
the
door
and
let
himself
out
the
stillness
was
then
prolonged
a
minute
by
the
further
wait
of
the
two
others
lord
theign
where
he
had
been
standing
and
his
daughter
on
the
spot
from
which
she
had
not
moved
it
presently
ended
in
his
lordship
s
turn
about
as
if
inferring
by
the
silence
that
the
intruder
had
withdrawn
is
that
young
man
your
lover
he
said
as
he
drew
again
near
lady
grace
waited
a
little
but
spoke
as
quietly
as
if
she
had
been
prepared
has
the
question
a
bearing
on
the
promise
you
a
short
time
ago
demanded
of
me
it
has
a
bearing
on
the
so
extraordinary
appearance
of
your
intimacy
with
him
you
mean
that
if
he
be
what
you
ask
me
about
your
exaction
would
then
be
modified
my
request
that
you
break
it
short
off
that
request
would
on
the
contrary
lord
theign
pronounced
rest
on
an
immense
new
ground
therefore
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
the
won
t
the
truth
be
before
you
father
if
you
ll
a
moment
without
extravagance
after
which
while
as
stiffly
as
ever
and
it
probably
seemed
to
her
impatience
as
stupidly
he
didn
t
rise
to
it
she
went
on
if
i
you
not
again
to
see
him
does
that
make
for
you
the
appearance
if
you
offered
it
you
mean
on
your
condition
my
promising
not
to
sell
i
promised
said
lord
theign
absolutely
nothing
at
all
she
took
him
up
with
all
expression
so
i
promised
as
little
but
that
i
should
have
been
able
to
say
what
i
did
sufficiently
meets
your
she
might
wronged
as
she
held
herself
have
felt
him
stupid
not
to
see
wronged
but
he
was
in
any
case
acute
for
an
evasion
you
risked
your
offer
for
the
great
equivalent
over
which
you
ve
so
wildly
worked
yourself
yes
i
ve
worked
myself
that
i
grant
you
and
don
t
blush
for
but
hardly
so
much
as
to
renounce
my
lover
if
she
prodigiously
smiled
i
were
so
fortunate
as
to
have
one
you
renounced
poor
john
mightily
easily
whom
you
were
so
fortunate
as
to
have
her
brows
rose
as
high
as
his
own
had
ever
done
do
you
call
lord
john
my
lover
he
was
your
suitor
most
assuredly
lord
theign
inimitably
said
though
without
looking
at
her
and
as
strikingly
encouraged
as
he
was
respectfully
ardent
encouraged
by
dear
father
beyond
doubt
encouraged
er
by
every
one
because
you
were
yes
you
encouraging
and
what
i
ask
of
you
now
is
a
word
of
common
candour
as
to
whether
you
didn
t
on
your
honour
turn
him
off
because
of
your
just
then
so
stimulated
views
on
the
person
who
has
been
with
grace
replied
but
after
an
instant
as
moved
by
more
things
than
she
could
say
moved
above
all
in
her
trouble
and
her
pity
for
him
by
other
things
than
harshness
oh
father
father
father
he
searched
her
through
all
the
compassion
of
her
cry
but
appeared
to
give
way
to
her
sincerity
well
then
if
i
your
denial
i
take
it
as
answering
my
whole
question
in
a
manner
that
satisfies
me
if
there
s
nothing
on
your
word
of
that
sort
between
you
you
can
all
the
more
drop
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
i
should
all
the
more
in
the
other
case
that
of
there
something
he
brushed
away
her
if
you
re
so
keen
then
for
past
remarks
i
take
up
your
own
words
i
accept
your
own
terms
for
your
putting
an
end
to
to
which
while
turning
pale
she
said
nothing
he
added
you
recognise
that
you
profess
yourself
ready
not
again
to
see
him
she
now
answered
if
you
tell
me
the
picture
s
safe
yes
i
recognise
that
i
ready
as
well
as
how
scornfully
little
you
then
were
never
mind
what
i
then
was
the
question
s
of
what
i
actually
am
since
i
close
with
you
on
it
the
picture
s
therefore
as
safe
as
you
please
lord
theign
pursued
if
you
ll
do
what
you
just
now
engaged
i
engaged
to
do
nothing
she
replied
after
a
pause
and
the
face
she
turned
to
him
had
grown
suddenly
tragic
i
ve
no
word
to
take
back
for
none
passed
between
us
but
i
do
what
i
mentioned
and
what
you
at
once
laughed
at
because
she
finished
the
case
is
different
he
almost
shouted
different
she
didn
t
look
at
him
for
it
but
she
was
none
the
less
strongly
distinct
he
has
here
and
that
has
done
it
he
knows
she
admirably
emphasised
knows
what
i
think
of
him
no
doubt
for
a
brazen
young
prevaricator
but
what
else
she
still
kept
her
eyes
on
a
point
what
he
will
have
seen
that
i
feel
we
re
too
good
then
your
denial
of
it
s
false
her
father
fairly
thundered
and
you
infatuated
it
made
her
the
more
quiet
i
like
him
very
so
that
your
row
about
the
picture
he
demanded
with
passion
has
been
all
a
blind
and
then
as
her
quietness
still
held
her
and
his
a
blind
as
much
to
help
him
to
get
you
she
looked
at
him
again
now
he
must
speak
for
himself
i
ve
said
what
i
but
what
the
devil
you
mean
lord
theign
taking
in
the
hour
had
reached
the
door
as
in
supremely
baffled
conclusion
and
with
a
sense
of
time
lamentably
lost
their
eyes
met
upon
it
all
dreadfully
across
the
wide
space
and
hurried
and
incommoded
as
she
saw
him
she
yet
made
him
still
stand
a
minute
then
she
let
everything
go
do
what
you
like
with
the
picture
he
jerked
up
his
arm
and
guarding
hand
as
before
a
levelled
blow
at
his
face
and
with
the
other
hand
flung
open
the
door
having
done
with
her
now
and
immediately
lost
to
sight
left
alone
she
stood
a
moment
looking
before
her
then
with
a
vague
advance
held
apparently
by
a
quickly
growing
sense
of
the
implication
of
her
act
reached
a
table
where
she
remained
a
little
deep
afresh
in
thought
only
the
next
thing
to
fall
into
a
chair
close
to
it
and
there
with
her
elbows
on
it
yield
to
the
impulse
of
covering
her
flushed
face
with
her
hands
book
third
i
hugh
crimble
waited
again
in
the
bruton
street
this
time
at
the
afternoon
hour
he
restlessly
shifted
his
place
looked
at
things
about
him
without
seeing
them
all
he
saw
all
he
outwardly
studied
was
his
own
face
and
figure
as
he
stopped
an
instant
before
a
long
glass
suspended
between
two
windows
just
as
he
turned
from
that
brief
and
perhaps
not
wholly
gratified
inspection
lady
grace
that
he
had
sent
up
his
name
to
whom
was
immediately
apparent
presented
herself
at
the
entrance
from
the
other
room
these
young
persons
had
hereupon
no
instant
exchange
of
words
their
exchange
was
mute
they
but
paused
where
they
were
while
the
silence
of
each
evidently
tested
the
other
for
full
confidence
a
measure
of
this
comfort
came
first
it
would
have
appeared
to
hugh
though
he
then
at
once
asked
for
confirmation
of
it
am
i
right
lady
grace
am
i
right
to
have
i
mean
after
so
many
days
of
not
hearing
not
knowing
and
perhaps
all
too
stupidly
not
and
he
went
on
as
still
with
her
eyes
on
him
she
didn
t
speak
though
only
we
should
have
guessed
from
her
stress
of
emotion
even
if
i
m
wrong
let
me
tell
you
i
don
t
care
simply
because
whatever
new
difficulty
i
may
have
brought
about
for
you
here
a
fortnight
ago
there
s
something
that
adds
to
my
doubt
and
my
fear
too
great
a
pang
and
that
has
made
me
feel
i
can
scarce
bear
the
suspense
of
them
as
they
the
girl
came
nearer
and
if
her
grave
face
expressed
a
pity
it
yet
declined
a
dread
of
what
suspense
do
you
speak
your
still
being
without
the
other
opinion
ah
that
worries
me
yes
and
all
the
more
at
this
hour
as
i
say
that
he
dropped
it
however
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
moment
my
torment
all
the
while
has
been
not
to
know
from
day
to
day
what
situation
what
complication
that
last
scene
of
ours
with
your
father
here
has
let
you
in
for
and
yet
at
the
same
time
having
no
sign
nor
sound
from
you
to
see
the
importance
of
not
making
anything
possibly
worse
by
approaching
you
again
however
discreetly
i
ve
been
in
the
dark
he
pursued
and
feeling
that
i
must
leave
there
so
that
now
just
brutally
turning
up
once
more
under
personal
need
and
at
any
cost
i
don
t
know
whether
i
most
want
or
most
fear
what
i
may
learn
from
lady
grace
listening
and
watching
appeared
to
choose
between
different
ways
of
meeting
this
appeal
she
had
a
pacifying
postponing
gesture
marked
with
a
beautiful
authority
a
sign
of
the
value
for
her
of
what
she
gave
precedence
to
and
which
waved
off
everything
else
have
you
had
first
of
all
any
news
yet
of
bardi
that
i
have
is
what
has
driven
me
straight
you
again
since
i
ve
shown
you
before
how
i
turn
to
you
at
a
crisis
he
has
come
as
i
hoped
and
like
a
regular
good
un
hugh
was
able
to
state
i
ve
just
met
him
at
the
station
but
i
pick
him
up
again
at
his
hotel
in
clifford
street
at
five
he
stopped
on
his
way
from
dover
this
morning
to
my
extreme
exasperation
to
sample
canterbury
and
i
leave
him
to
a
bath
and
a
change
and
tea
then
swooping
down
i
whirl
him
round
to
bond
street
where
his
very
first
apprehension
of
the
thing
an
apprehension
oh
i
guarantee
you
so
quick
and
clean
and
fine
and
wise
will
be
the
projected
well
said
the
young
man
to
wind
up
handsomely
but
briefly
and
reasonably
over
the
whole
field
of
our
she
panted
with
comprehension
that
of
the
two
portraits
being
but
the
one
sitter
that
of
the
two
portraits
being
but
the
one
sitter
with
everything
so
to
the
good
more
and
more
that
bangs
in
up
to
the
head
the
golden
nail
of
authenticity
and
he
quite
glowed
through
his
gloom
for
it
we
take
our
stand
in
glory
on
the
last
mantovano
in
the
it
was
a
presumption
his
friend
visibly
yearned
for
but
over
which
too
with
her
eyes
away
from
him
she
still
distinguished
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
that
is
if
the
comes
that
is
if
it
comes
indeed
confound
it
he
had
to
enlarge
a
little
under
the
recall
of
past
experience
so
now
at
any
rate
you
see
my
tension
she
looked
at
him
again
as
with
a
vision
too
full
for
a
waste
of
words
while
you
on
your
side
of
course
keep
well
in
view
bender
yes
while
i
keep
well
in
view
bender
s
though
he
doesn
t
know
you
see
of
bardi
s
being
at
still
said
the
girl
always
all
lucid
for
the
case
if
the
does
presently
break
it
will
first
take
him
in
the
eye
hugh
had
jumped
to
her
idea
but
he
adopted
it
only
to
provide
it
might
if
he
didn
t
now
wear
goggles
so
to
say
clapped
on
him
too
hard
by
pappendick
s
so
damnably
perverse
with
which
however
he
quickly
bethought
himself
ah
of
course
these
wretched
days
you
haven
t
known
of
pappendick
s
personal
visit
after
that
wire
from
verona
i
wired
him
back
defiance
and
that
brought
him
she
cried
to
do
the
honest
thing
yes
i
say
for
him
to
renew
for
full
assurance
his
early
memory
of
our
she
hung
upon
it
but
only
to
stick
then
to
what
he
had
telegraphed
to
declare
that
for
lackaday
our
thing
s
a
pure
moretto
and
to
declare
as
much
moreover
with
all
the
weight
of
his
authority
to
bender
himself
who
of
course
made
a
point
of
seeing
so
that
bender
she
followed
and
wondered
is
as
a
consequence
wholly
off
it
made
her
friend
s
humour
play
up
in
his
bender
lady
grace
is
by
the
law
of
his
being
never
wholly
off
or
on
anything
he
lives
like
the
moon
in
shedding
his
silver
light
on
earth
never
quite
gone
yet
never
there
save
for
inappreciable
moments
he
be
in
eclipse
as
a
peril
i
grant
hugh
went
on
if
the
question
had
struck
him
as
really
closed
but
luckily
the
blessed
press
which
is
a
pure
heavenly
joy
and
now
quite
immense
on
it
keeps
it
open
as
wide
as
which
makes
however
lady
grace
discriminated
for
the
danger
of
a
ah
but
all
the
more
for
the
shame
of
a
surrender
of
course
i
admit
that
when
it
s
a
question
of
a
life
spent
like
his
in
waiting
acquisitively
for
the
cat
to
jump
the
only
thing
for
one
at
a
given
moment
as
against
that
signal
is
to
be
found
one
s
self
by
the
animal
in
the
line
of
its
trajectory
that
s
exactly
he
laughed
where
we
are
she
cast
about
as
intelligently
to
note
the
place
your
great
idea
you
mean
so
worked
with
the
uproar
truly
as
loud
as
it
has
seemed
to
come
to
us
here
all
beyond
my
wildest
hope
hugh
returned
since
the
sight
of
the
picture
flocked
to
every
day
by
thousands
so
beautifully
that
we
must
at
any
cost
keep
it
that
the
nation
must
and
hang
on
to
it
tight
is
the
cry
that
fills
the
air
to
the
tune
of
ten
letters
a
day
in
the
papers
with
every
three
days
a
gorgeous
leader
to
say
nothing
of
more
and
more
passionate
talk
all
over
the
place
some
of
it
awfully
wild
but
all
of
it
wind
in
our
i
suppose
it
was
that
wind
then
that
blew
me
round
there
to
see
the
thing
in
its
new
light
lady
grace
said
but
i
couldn
t
stay
for
tears
ah
hugh
insisted
on
his
side
for
comfort
we
ll
crow
loudest
yet
and
don
t
meanwhile
just
those
splendid
strange
eyes
of
the
fellow
seem
consciously
to
plead
the
women
bless
them
adore
him
cling
to
him
and
there
s
talk
of
a
ladies
league
of
protest
all
of
which
keeps
up
the
poor
amy
and
i
are
a
ladies
league
the
girl
joylessly
joked
as
we
now
take
in
the
journal
regardless
of
oh
then
you
practically
it
all
since
hugh
added
after
a
brief
hesitation
i
suppose
lord
theign
himself
doesn
t
languish
at
salsomaggiore
by
the
papers
no
doubt
indeed
he
isn
t
spared
even
the
worst
said
lady
grace
and
no
doubt
too
it
s
a
drag
on
his
her
companion
seemed
struck
with
her
lack
of
assurance
then
you
don
t
if
i
may
ask
hear
from
him
i
never
a
he
doesn
t
write
hugh
allowed
himself
to
insist
he
doesn
t
write
and
i
don
t
write
and
lady
sandgate
hugh
once
more
ventured
doesn
t
write
doesn
t
hear
said
the
young
man
treating
the
other
form
of
the
question
as
a
shade
evasive
i
ve
asked
her
not
to
tell
me
his
friend
replied
that
is
if
he
simply
holds
so
that
as
she
doesn
t
tell
you
hugh
was
clear
for
the
inference
he
of
course
does
hold
to
which
he
added
almost
accusingly
while
his
eyes
searched
her
but
your
case
is
really
she
confessed
to
it
after
a
moment
but
as
if
vaguely
enjoying
it
my
case
is
really
he
had
a
vividness
of
impatience
and
contrition
and
it
s
i
who
all
too
blunderingly
have
made
it
so
i
ve
made
it
so
myself
she
said
with
a
high
and
you
on
the
contrary
but
here
she
checked
her
emphasis
ah
i
ve
so
through
our
horrid
silence
to
help
you
and
he
pressed
to
get
more
at
the
truth
you
ve
so
quite
fatally
displeased
him
to
the
last
point
as
i
tell
you
but
it
s
not
to
that
i
refer
she
explained
it
s
to
the
ground
of
complaint
i
ve
given
and
then
as
this
but
left
him
blank
it
s
time
it
was
at
once
time
that
you
should
know
she
pursued
and
yet
if
it
s
hard
for
me
to
speak
as
you
see
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
write
but
there
it
she
made
her
sad
and
beautiful
effort
the
last
thing
before
he
left
us
i
let
the
picture
you
mean
but
he
could
only
wonder
till
however
it
glimmered
upon
him
you
gave
up
your
protest
i
gave
up
my
protest
i
told
him
that
so
far
as
i
m
concerned
he
might
do
as
he
her
poor
friend
turned
pale
at
the
sharp
little
shock
of
it
but
if
his
face
thus
showed
the
pang
of
too
great
a
surprise
he
yet
wreathed
the
convulsion
in
a
gay
grimace
you
leave
me
to
struggle
alone
i
leave
you
to
struggle
he
took
it
in
bewilderingly
but
tried
again
even
to
the
heroic
for
optimism
ah
well
you
decided
i
suppose
on
some
new
personal
yes
a
reason
came
up
a
reason
i
hadn
t
to
that
extent
looked
for
and
which
of
a
sudden
quickly
before
he
went
i
somehow
to
deal
with
so
to
give
him
my
word
in
the
dismal
sense
i
mention
was
my
only
way
to
meet
the
she
paused
hugh
waited
for
something
further
and
i
gave
him
my
word
i
wouldn
t
help
you
she
wound
up
he
turned
it
over
to
in
the
matter
i
to
act
in
the
matter
she
went
through
with
it
after
the
high
stand
i
had
still
he
studied
it
i
see
i
see
it
s
between
you
and
your
it
s
between
him
and
me
yes
an
engagement
not
again
to
trouble
hugh
from
his
face
might
have
feared
a
still
greater
complication
so
he
made
as
he
would
probably
have
said
a
jolly
lot
of
this
ah
that
was
nice
of
you
and
natural
all
right
no
she
spoke
from
a
deeper
depth
it
s
altogether
wrong
for
whatever
happens
i
must
now
accept
well
say
you
must
he
really
declined
not
to
treat
it
almost
as
rather
a
lark
if
we
can
at
least
go
on
ah
we
at
least
go
on
talking
she
perversely
sighed
i
can
say
anything
i
like
so
long
as
i
don
t
say
it
to
she
almost
wailed
but
she
added
with
more
firmness
i
can
still
hope
and
i
can
still
he
set
free
again
with
a
joyous
gesture
all
his
confidence
well
what
more
you
do
anyhow
so
isn
t
that
enough
it
took
her
a
moment
to
say
and
even
then
she
didn
t
is
it
enough
for
crimble
what
enough
for
me
he
could
for
his
part
readily
name
it
is
the
harm
done
you
at
our
last
meeting
by
my
irruption
so
that
if
you
got
his
consent
to
see
me
i
didn
t
get
his
consent
she
had
turned
away
from
the
searching
eyes
but
she
faced
them
again
to
rectify
i
see
you
against
his
express
ah
then
thank
god
i
came
it
was
like
a
bland
breath
on
a
de
he
flamed
so
much
higher
thank
god
you
ve
come
yes
for
my
deplorable
and
to
justify
her
name
for
it
before
he
could
protest
i
him
here
not
to
see
you
she
rigorously
explained
offered
him
hugh
did
drop
for
it
not
to
see
me
ever
again
she
didn
t
falter
never
ah
then
he
understood
but
he
wouldn
t
let
that
serve
not
for
the
price
i
put
on
his
yielding
on
the
picture
his
yielding
on
the
hugh
lingered
before
it
all
your
proposal
wasn
t
good
enough
it
wasn
t
good
i
see
he
repeated
i
but
he
was
in
that
light
again
mystified
then
why
are
you
therefore
not
free
because
just
after
you
came
back
and
i
see
you
again
ah
it
was
all
present
you
found
you
were
too
sorry
for
me
i
found
i
was
too
sorry
for
you
as
he
himself
found
i
hugh
had
got
hold
of
it
now
and
you
mean
he
couldn
t
stomach
so
little
that
when
you
had
gone
and
you
had
to
go
you
remember
he
at
once
proposed
rather
than
that
i
should
deceive
you
in
a
way
so
different
from
his
own
to
do
all
we
want
of
him
to
do
all
i
did
at
and
it
was
he
took
in
that
you
wouldn
t
deal
well
try
though
she
might
to
keep
the
colour
out
it
all
came
straighter
and
straighter
now
those
moments
had
brought
you
home
to
me
as
they
had
also
brought
making
such
a
difference
i
felt
for
what
he
veered
round
to
agree
the
difference
hugh
wanted
it
so
adorably
definite
that
you
didn
t
see
your
way
to
accepting
no
not
to
accepting
the
condition
he
which
was
that
he
d
keep
the
picture
for
you
if
you
d
treat
me
as
too
low
if
i
d
treat
you
said
lady
grace
with
her
eyes
on
his
fine
young
face
as
he
kept
her
eyes
he
clearly
liked
so
to
make
her
repeat
it
and
not
even
for
the
sake
of
the
picture
after
he
had
given
her
time
however
her
silence
with
her
beautiful
look
in
it
seemed
to
admonish
him
not
to
force
her
for
his
pleasure
as
if
what
she
had
already
told
him
didn
t
make
him
throb
enough
for
the
wonder
of
it
he
it
and
let
her
see
by
his
high
flush
how
he
made
it
his
own
while
the
next
thing
as
it
was
but
part
of
her
avowal
the
rest
of
that
illumination
called
for
a
different
intelligence
your
father
s
reprobation
of
me
personally
is
on
the
ground
that
you
re
all
such
great
people
she
spared
him
the
invidious
answer
to
this
as
a
moment
before
his
eagerness
had
spared
her
reserve
she
flung
over
the
ground
that
his
question
laid
bare
the
light
veil
of
an
evasion
great
people
i
ve
learned
to
see
mustn
t
to
remain
great
do
what
my
father
s
it
s
indeed
on
the
theory
of
their
not
so
behaving
hugh
returned
that
we
see
them
all
the
inferior
rest
of
us
in
the
grand
glamour
of
their
greatness
if
he
had
spoken
to
meet
her
admirable
frankness
that
beauty
in
her
almost
brushed
him
aside
to
make
at
a
single
step
the
rest
of
the
journey
you
won
t
see
them
in
it
for
long
if
they
don
t
now
under
such
tests
and
with
such
opportunities
begin
to
take
this
had
given
him
at
a
stroke
he
clearly
felt
all
freedom
for
the
closer
criticism
lord
theign
perhaps
recognises
some
such
canny
truth
but
takes
care
with
the
least
trouble
to
himself
and
the
finest
short
cut
does
it
if
you
ll
let
me
say
so
rather
on
the
cheap
by
finding
the
likes
of
me
as
his
daughter
s
trusted
friend
out
of
the
well
you
won
t
mind
that
will
you
lady
grace
asked
if
he
finds
his
daughter
herself
in
any
such
relation
to
you
quite
as
much
different
enough
from
position
to
position
and
person
to
person
he
brightly
brooded
is
the
view
that
gets
itself
comfortably
taken
of
the
implications
of
honour
yes
the
girl
returned
my
father
in
the
act
of
despoiling
us
all
all
who
are
interested
without
apparently
the
least
unpleasant
consciousness
keeps
the
balance
showily
even
to
his
mostly
so
fine
so
delicate
sense
by
suddenly
discovering
that
he
s
scandalised
at
my
caring
for
your
hugh
looked
at
her
on
this
as
with
the
gladness
verily
of
possession
promised
and
only
waiting
or
as
if
from
that
moment
forth
he
had
her
assurance
of
everything
that
most
concerned
him
and
that
might
most
inspire
well
isn
t
the
moral
of
it
all
simply
that
what
his
perversity
of
pride
as
we
can
only
hold
it
will
have
most
done
for
us
is
to
bring
us
and
to
keep
us
blessedly
together
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
question
his
do
you
regard
us
as
so
much
together
when
you
remember
where
in
spite
of
everything
i
ve
put
myself
by
telling
him
to
do
what
he
likes
he
recalled
without
embarrassment
oh
that
wasn
t
in
spite
of
everything
it
was
only
in
spite
of
the
only
she
flushed
when
i
ve
given
the
picture
up
ah
hugh
cried
i
don
t
care
a
hang
for
the
picture
and
then
as
she
let
him
closer
close
to
her
with
this
possess
himself
of
her
hands
we
both
only
care
don
t
we
that
we
re
given
to
each
other
thus
we
both
only
care
don
t
we
that
nothing
can
keep
us
apart
oh
if
you
ve
forgiven
me
she
sighed
into
his
fond
face
why
since
you
gave
the
thing
up
me
he
pleadingly
laughed
it
isn
t
as
if
you
had
given
up
for
anything
anything
ah
never
never
she
breathed
then
why
aren
t
we
all
right
well
if
you
will
oh
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
and
with
this
ardent
cry
of
his
devotion
his
arms
closed
in
their
strength
and
she
was
clasped
to
his
breast
and
to
his
lips
the
next
moment
however
she
had
checked
him
with
the
warning
amy
sandgate
as
if
she
had
heard
their
hostess
enter
the
other
room
lady
was
in
fact
almost
already
upon
them
their
disjunction
had
scarce
been
effected
and
she
had
reached
the
nearer
threshold
they
had
at
once
put
the
widest
space
possible
between
them
a
little
of
the
flurry
of
which
transaction
agitated
doubtless
their
clutch
at
composure
they
gave
back
a
shade
awkwardly
and
consciously
on
one
side
and
the
other
the
speculative
though
gracious
attention
she
for
a
few
moments
made
them
and
their
recent
intimate
relation
the
subject
of
from
all
of
which
indeed
lady
grace
sought
and
found
cover
in
a
prompt
and
responsible
address
to
hugh
mustn
t
you
go
without
more
delay
to
clifford
street
he
came
back
to
it
all
alert
at
once
he
had
recovered
his
hat
and
reached
the
other
door
whence
he
gesticulated
farewell
to
the
elder
lady
please
pardon
me
and
he
disappeared
lady
sandgate
hereupon
stood
for
a
little
silently
confronted
with
the
girl
have
you
freedom
of
mind
for
the
fact
that
your
father
s
suddenly
at
hand
he
has
come
back
lady
grace
was
sharply
struck
he
arrives
this
afternoon
and
appears
to
go
straight
to
kitty
according
to
a
wire
that
i
find
downstairs
on
coming
back
late
from
my
luncheon
he
has
returned
with
a
rush
as
said
his
correspondent
in
the
elation
of
triumph
i
was
he
would
her
young
friend
was
more
at
sea
brought
back
you
mean
by
the
outcry
even
though
he
so
hates
it
but
she
was
more
and
more
all
lucidity
save
in
so
far
as
she
was
now
almost
all
authority
ah
hating
still
more
to
seem
afraid
he
has
come
back
to
face
the
music
lady
grace
turning
away
as
in
vague
despair
for
the
manner
in
which
the
music
might
affect
him
yet
wheeled
about
again
after
thought
to
a
positive
recognition
and
even
to
quite
an
inconsequent
pride
yes
that
s
dear
old
father
and
what
was
lady
sandgate
moreover
but
mistress
now
of
the
subject
at
the
point
the
row
has
reached
he
couldn
t
stand
it
another
day
so
he
has
thrown
up
his
cure
and
lest
we
should
oppose
him
not
even
announced
his
well
her
companion
returned
now
that
i
ve
it
all
i
shall
never
oppose
him
again
lady
sandgate
appeared
to
show
herself
as
still
under
the
impression
she
might
have
received
on
entering
he
ll
only
oppose
if
he
does
said
lady
grace
we
re
at
present
two
to
bear
heaven
save
us
then
the
elder
woman
was
quick
was
even
cordial
for
the
sense
of
this
your
good
friend
clever
lady
grace
honoured
the
remark
mr
s
remarkably
and
you
ve
arranged
we
haven
t
arranged
but
we
ve
understood
so
that
dear
amy
if
understand
lady
grace
paused
for
gotch
had
come
in
from
the
hall
his
lordship
has
arrived
his
mistress
immediately
put
to
him
no
my
lady
but
lord
john
has
to
know
if
he
s
expected
and
in
that
case
by
your
ladyship
s
leave
to
come
her
ladyship
turned
to
the
girl
may
lord
john
as
we
do
await
your
father
come
up
as
suits
please
he
may
come
up
said
lady
sandgate
to
gotch
his
lordship
s
she
had
a
pause
till
they
were
alone
again
when
she
went
on
to
her
companion
you
asked
me
just
now
if
i
understood
well
i
do
understand
lady
grace
with
gotch
s
withdrawal
which
left
the
door
open
had
reached
the
passage
to
the
other
room
then
you
ll
excuse
me
she
made
her
escape
ii
lord
john
reannounced
the
next
instant
from
the
nearest
quarter
and
quite
waiving
salutations
left
no
doubt
of
the
high
pitch
of
his
eagerness
and
tension
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
what
on
earth
then
do
you
suppose
he
has
come
back
to
to
which
he
added
while
his
hostess
s
gesture
impatiently
disclaimed
conjecture
because
when
a
fellow
really
finds
himself
the
centre
of
a
cyclone
isn
t
it
just
at
the
centre
she
interrupted
that
you
keep
remarkably
still
and
only
in
the
suburbs
that
you
feel
the
rage
i
count
on
dear
theign
s
doing
nothing
in
the
least
foolish
ah
but
he
can
t
have
chucked
everything
for
nothing
lord
john
sharply
returned
and
wherever
you
place
him
in
the
rumpus
he
can
t
not
meet
somehow
hang
it
such
an
assault
on
his
character
as
a
great
nobleman
and
good
it
s
his
luck
to
have
become
with
the
public
of
the
newspapers
the
for
the
sins
of
a
lot
of
people
lady
sandgate
inconclusively
sighed
yes
lord
john
concluded
for
her
the
mercenary
millions
on
whose
traffic
in
their
trumpery
values
when
they
re
so
lucky
as
to
have
any
isn
t
a
patch
oh
there
are
cases
cases
situations
and
responsibilities
so
intensely
differ
that
appeared
on
the
whole
for
her
ladyship
the
moral
to
be
gathered
of
course
everything
differs
all
round
from
everything
lord
john
went
on
and
who
in
the
world
knows
anything
of
his
own
case
but
the
victim
of
circumstances
exposing
himself
for
the
highest
and
purest
motives
to
be
literally
torn
to
pieces
well
said
lady
sandgate
as
in
her
strained
suspense
she
freshly
consulted
her
bracelet
watch
i
hope
he
isn
t
already
torn
if
you
tell
me
you
ve
been
to
kitty
oh
he
was
all
right
so
far
he
had
arrived
and
gone
out
again
the
young
man
explained
as
lady
imber
hadn
t
been
at
ah
cool
kitty
his
hostess
sighed
again
but
diverted
as
she
spoke
by
the
reappearance
of
her
butler
this
time
positively
preceding
lord
theign
whom
she
met
when
he
presently
stood
before
her
his
garb
of
travel
exchanged
for
consummate
afternoon
dress
with
yearning
tenderness
and
compassionate
curiosity
at
last
dearest
friend
what
a
joy
but
with
kitty
not
at
home
to
receive
you
that
young
woman
s
parent
made
light
of
it
for
the
indulged
creature
s
sake
oh
i
knew
my
kitty
i
dressed
and
i
find
her
at
to
which
he
added
as
he
only
took
in
further
without
expression
lord
john
but
bender
who
came
there
before
my
arrival
he
hasn
t
tried
for
me
here
it
was
a
point
on
which
lord
john
himself
could
at
least
be
expressive
i
met
him
at
the
club
at
luncheon
he
had
had
your
letter
but
for
which
chance
my
dear
man
i
should
have
known
nothing
you
ll
see
him
all
right
at
this
house
but
i
m
glad
if
i
may
say
so
theign
the
speaker
pursued
with
some
emphasis
i
m
glad
you
know
to
get
hold
of
you
lord
theign
seemed
about
to
ask
for
the
meaning
of
this
remark
but
his
other
companion
s
apprehension
had
already
overflowed
you
haven
t
come
back
have
you
to
whatever
it
may
be
for
of
any
sort
with
breckenridge
his
lordship
transferred
his
penetration
to
this
fair
friend
have
you
become
so
intensely
absorbed
these
remarkable
days
in
breckenridge
she
felt
the
shadow
you
would
have
seen
of
his
claimed
right
or
at
least
privilege
of
search
yet
easily
after
an
instant
emerged
clear
i
ve
thought
and
dreamt
but
of
suspicious
man
in
proportion
as
the
clamour
has
spread
and
bender
meanwhile
if
you
want
to
know
hasn
t
been
near
me
once
lord
john
came
in
a
manner
and
however
unconsciously
to
her
aid
you
d
have
seen
if
he
had
been
what
s
the
matter
with
him
i
think
and
what
perhaps
theign
has
seen
from
his
own
letter
since
he
went
on
to
his
i
understood
him
a
week
ago
to
have
been
much
taken
up
with
writing
lord
theign
received
this
without
comment
only
again
with
an
air
of
expertly
sounding
the
speaker
after
which
he
gave
himself
afresh
for
a
moment
to
lady
sandgate
i
ve
not
come
home
for
any
clamour
as
you
surely
know
me
well
enough
to
believe
or
to
notice
for
a
minute
the
cheapest
insolence
and
aggression
which
frankly
scarce
reached
me
out
there
or
which
so
far
as
it
did
i
was
daily
washed
clean
of
by
those
blest
waters
i
returned
on
bender
s
letter
he
then
vouchsafed
to
lord
john
three
extraordinarily
vulgar
pages
about
the
egregious
about
his
having
suddenly
turned
up
in
person
yes
and
as
breckenridge
says
marked
the
picture
down
the
young
man
was
clearly
that
of
course
weighed
on
bender
being
confirmed
apparently
on
the
whole
by
the
drift
of
public
lord
theign
took
on
this
with
a
frank
show
of
reaction
from
some
of
his
friend
s
terms
a
sharp
turn
off
he
even
ironically
indicated
the
babbler
or
at
least
the
blunderer
in
question
to
lady
sandgate
he
too
has
known
me
so
long
and
he
comes
here
to
talk
to
me
of
the
drift
of
public
opinion
after
which
he
quite
charged
at
his
vain
informant
am
i
to
tell
you
again
that
i
snap
my
fingers
at
the
drift
of
public
opinion
which
is
but
another
name
for
the
chatter
of
all
the
fools
one
doesn
t
know
in
addition
to
all
those
and
plenty
of
em
one
damnably
lady
sandgate
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
dropped
oil
from
her
golden
cruse
ah
you
did
in
your
own
grand
way
before
you
went
abroad
i
don
t
speak
of
the
matter
my
dear
man
in
the
light
of
its
effect
on
lord
john
importantly
explained
but
in
the
light
of
its
effect
on
bender
who
so
consumedly
wants
the
picture
if
he
to
have
it
to
be
a
mantovano
but
seems
unable
to
get
it
taken
at
last
for
anything
but
the
fine
old
moretto
that
of
course
it
has
always
lord
theign
in
growing
disgust
at
the
whole
beastly
complication
betrayed
more
and
more
the
odd
pitch
of
the
temper
that
had
abruptly
restored
him
with
such
incalculable
weight
to
the
scene
of
action
well
isn
t
a
fine
old
moretto
good
enough
for
him
confound
him
it
pulled
up
not
a
little
lord
john
who
yet
made
his
point
a
fine
old
moretto
you
know
was
exactly
what
he
declined
at
dedborough
for
its
comparative
strictly
comparative
insignificance
and
he
only
thought
of
the
picture
when
the
wind
began
to
rise
for
the
enormous
rarity
that
that
mendacious
young
cad
who
has
bamboozled
grace
lord
theign
broke
in
tried
to
befool
us
for
his
beggarly
reasons
into
claiming
for
it
lady
sandgate
renewed
her
mild
influence
ah
the
knowing
people
haven
t
had
their
last
word
the
possible
mantovano
isn
t
exploded
her
noble
friend
however
declined
the
offered
spell
i
ve
had
enough
of
the
knowing
people
the
knowing
people
are
serpents
my
picture
s
to
take
or
to
leave
and
it
s
what
i
ve
come
back
if
you
please
john
to
say
to
your
man
to
his
this
declaration
had
a
report
as
sharp
and
almost
as
multiplied
as
the
successive
cracks
of
a
discharged
revolver
yet
when
the
light
smoke
cleared
lady
at
least
was
still
left
standing
and
smiling
yes
why
in
mercy
s
name
can
t
he
choose
and
why
does
he
write
him
dreadful
breckenridge
such
tiresome
argumentative
letters
lord
john
took
up
her
idea
as
with
the
air
of
something
that
had
been
working
in
him
rather
vehemently
though
under
due
caution
too
as
a
consequence
of
this
exchange
during
which
he
had
apprehensively
watched
his
elder
i
don
t
think
i
quite
see
my
dear
theign
the
poor
chap
s
letter
was
so
in
that
case
his
dear
theign
could
tell
him
because
it
was
a
tissue
of
expressions
that
may
pass
current
over
counters
and
in
awful
newspapers
in
extraordinary
world
or
country
but
that
i
decline
to
take
time
to
puzzle
out
if
he
didn
t
make
himself
understood
lord
john
took
leave
to
laugh
it
must
indeed
have
been
an
unusual
production
for
oh
i
often
with
the
wild
beauty
if
you
will
of
so
many
of
his
turns
haven
t
a
notion
lady
sandgate
confessed
with
an
equal
gaiety
of
what
he
s
talking
i
think
i
never
miss
his
weird
sense
her
younger
guest
again
loyally
contended
and
in
fact
as
a
general
thing
i
rather
like
it
i
happen
to
like
nothing
that
i
don
t
enjoy
lord
theign
rejoined
with
some
asperity
and
so
far
as
i
do
follow
the
fellow
he
assumes
on
my
part
an
interest
in
his
expenditure
of
that
i
neither
feel
nor
pretend
to
he
doesn
t
want
by
what
i
spell
out
the
picture
he
refused
at
dedborough
he
may
possibly
want
if
one
reads
it
so
the
picture
on
view
in
bond
street
and
he
yet
appears
to
make
with
great
emphasis
the
stupid
ambiguous
point
that
these
two
articles
the
greatest
of
morettos
an
article
haven
t
been
by
now
proved
different
as
if
i
engaged
with
him
that
i
myself
would
so
prove
them
lord
john
indulged
in
a
pause
but
also
in
a
suggestion
he
must
allude
to
your
hoping
when
you
allowed
us
to
place
the
picture
with
mackintosh
that
it
would
show
to
all
london
in
the
most
precious
light
well
if
it
hasn
t
so
shown
and
lord
theign
stared
as
if
mystified
what
in
the
world
s
the
meaning
of
this
preposterous
racket
the
racket
is
largely
his
young
friend
explained
the
vociferation
of
the
people
who
contradict
each
other
about
on
which
their
hostess
sought
to
enliven
the
gravity
of
the
question
some
yes
shouting
on
the
housetops
that
s
a
mantovano
of
the
mantovanos
and
others
shrieking
back
at
them
that
they
re
donkeys
if
not
he
may
take
it
for
whatever
he
likes
said
lord
theign
heedless
of
these
contributions
he
may
father
it
on
michael
angelo
himself
if
he
ll
but
clear
out
with
it
and
let
me
alone
what
he
d
to
take
it
for
lord
john
at
this
point
saw
his
way
to
remark
is
something
in
the
nature
of
a
hundred
a
hundred
thousand
cried
his
astonished
friend
quite
i
dare
say
a
hundred
thousand
the
young
man
enjoyed
clearly
handling
even
by
the
lips
so
round
a
sum
lady
sandgate
disclaimed
however
with
agility
any
appearance
of
having
gaped
why
haven
t
you
yet
realised
theign
that
those
are
the
american
figures
his
lordship
looked
at
her
fixedly
and
then
did
the
same
by
lord
john
after
which
he
waited
a
little
i
ve
nothing
to
do
with
the
american
figures
which
seem
to
me
if
you
press
me
you
know
quite
intolerably
well
i
d
be
as
vulgar
as
anybody
for
a
hundred
thousand
lady
sandgate
hastened
to
proclaim
didn
t
he
let
us
know
at
dedborough
lord
john
asked
of
the
master
of
that
seat
that
he
had
no
use
as
he
said
for
lower
values
i
ve
heard
him
remark
myself
said
their
companion
rising
to
the
monstrous
memory
that
he
wouldn
t
take
a
cheap
picture
even
though
a
handsome
one
as
a
and
does
he
call
the
thing
round
the
corner
a
cheap
picture
the
proprietor
of
the
work
demanded
lord
john
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
grin
of
impatience
all
he
wants
to
do
don
t
you
see
is
to
prevent
your
it
one
lord
theign
glared
at
this
imputation
to
him
of
a
low
ductility
i
offered
the
thing
as
it
was
at
an
estimate
worthy
of
it
and
of
my
dear
reckless
friend
his
young
adviser
protested
you
named
no
figure
when
it
came
to
the
point
it
come
to
the
point
nothing
came
to
the
point
but
that
i
put
a
moretto
on
view
as
a
thing
yes
perfectly
lord
theign
accepted
the
reminding
gesture
on
which
a
rich
american
had
an
eye
and
in
which
he
had
so
to
speak
an
interest
that
was
what
i
wanted
and
so
we
left
it
parting
each
of
us
ready
but
neither
of
us
ah
bender
s
bound
as
he
d
say
lady
interposed
bound
to
make
you
swallow
the
enormous
luscious
plum
that
your
appetite
so
morbidly
rejects
my
appetite
as
morbid
as
you
like
her
old
friend
had
shrewdly
turned
on
her
is
my
own
affair
and
if
the
fellow
must
deal
in
enormities
i
warn
him
to
carry
them
elsewhere
lord
john
plainly
by
this
time
was
quite
exasperated
at
the
absurdity
of
him
but
how
can
t
you
see
that
it
s
only
a
plum
as
she
says
for
a
plum
and
an
eye
for
an
eye
since
the
picture
itself
with
this
huge
ventilation
is
now
quite
a
different
affair
how
the
deuce
a
different
affair
when
just
what
the
man
himself
confesses
is
that
in
spite
of
all
the
chatter
of
the
prigs
and
pedants
there
s
no
really
established
ground
for
treating
it
as
anything
but
the
same
on
which
as
having
so
unanswerably
spoken
lord
theign
shook
himself
free
again
in
his
high
petulance
and
moved
restlessly
to
where
the
passage
to
the
other
room
appeared
to
offer
his
nerves
an
issue
all
moreover
to
the
effect
of
suggesting
to
us
that
something
still
other
than
what
he
had
said
might
meanwhile
work
in
him
behind
and
beneath
that
quantity
the
spectators
of
his
trouble
watched
him
for
the
time
in
uncertainty
and
with
a
mute
but
associated
comment
on
the
perversity
and
oddity
he
had
so
suddenly
developed
lord
john
giving
a
shrug
of
almost
bored
despair
and
lady
sandgate
signalling
caution
and
tact
for
their
action
by
a
finger
flourished
to
her
lips
and
in
fact
at
once
proceeding
to
apply
these
arts
the
subject
of
her
attention
had
still
remained
as
in
worried
thought
he
had
even
mechanically
taken
up
a
book
from
a
table
which
he
then
after
an
absent
glance
at
it
tossed
down
you
re
so
detached
from
reality
you
adorable
dreamer
she
began
and
unless
you
stick
to
you
might
as
well
have
done
nothing
what
you
call
the
pedantry
and
priggishness
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
exactly
what
poor
breckenridge
asked
almost
on
his
knees
wonderful
man
to
be
to
pay
you
for
since
even
if
the
meddlers
and
chatterers
haven
t
settled
anything
for
those
who
know
though
which
of
the
elect
themselves
after
all
seem
to
know
it
s
a
great
service
rendered
him
to
have
started
such
a
hare
to
run
lord
john
took
freedom
to
throw
off
very
much
the
same
idea
certainly
his
connection
with
the
whole
question
and
agitation
makes
no
end
for
his
it
didn
t
that
remark
bring
their
friend
back
to
him
but
it
at
least
made
his
indifference
flash
with
derision
his
glory
bender
s
glory
why
they
quite
universally
loathe
him
judging
by
the
stuff
they
print
oh
here
as
a
corrupter
of
our
morals
and
a
promoter
of
our
decay
even
though
so
many
are
flat
on
their
faces
to
him
yes
but
it
s
another
affair
over
there
where
the
eagle
screams
like
a
thousand
and
the
newspapers
flap
like
the
leaves
of
the
forest
he
ll
be
if
you
ll
only
let
him
the
biggest
thing
going
since
sound
in
that
air
seems
to
mean
size
and
size
to
be
all
that
counts
if
he
said
of
the
thing
as
you
recognise
lord
john
went
on
it
s
going
to
be
a
mantovano
why
you
can
bet
your
life
that
it
that
it
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
his
at
this
drew
nearer
again
irritated
you
would
have
been
sure
by
the
unconscious
infelicity
of
the
pair
worked
up
to
something
quite
openly
wilful
and
passionate
no
kind
of
a
furious
flaunting
one
under
patronage
that
i
can
prevent
my
boy
the
dedborough
picture
in
the
market
owing
to
horrid
little
circumstances
that
regard
myself
alone
is
the
dedborough
picture
at
a
decent
sufficient
civilised
dedborough
price
and
nothing
else
whatever
which
i
beg
you
will
take
as
my
last
word
on
the
lord
john
trying
whether
he
take
it
momentarily
mingled
his
hushed
state
with
that
of
their
hostess
to
whom
he
addressed
a
helpless
look
after
which
however
he
appeared
to
find
that
he
could
only
reassert
himself
may
i
nevertheless
reply
that
i
think
you
ll
not
be
able
to
prevent
since
the
discussed
object
will
completely
escape
your
control
in
new
york
and
almost
any
discussed
object
lady
rose
to
the
occasion
also
is
in
new
york
by
what
one
hears
easily
a
hundred
thousand
lord
theign
looked
from
one
of
them
to
the
other
i
sell
the
man
a
hundred
thousand
worth
of
swagger
and
advertisement
and
of
fraudulent
swagger
and
objectionable
advertisement
at
that
well
lord
john
was
but
briefly
baffled
when
the
picture
s
his
you
can
t
help
its
doing
what
it
can
and
what
it
will
for
him
anywhere
then
it
isn
t
his
yet
the
elder
man
retorted
and
i
promise
you
never
will
be
if
he
has
you
to
me
with
his
big
drum
lady
sandgate
turned
sadly
on
this
to
her
associate
in
patience
as
if
the
case
were
now
really
beyond
them
yes
how
indeed
can
it
ever
his
if
theign
simply
won
t
let
him
pay
for
it
her
question
was
unanswerable
it
s
the
first
time
in
all
my
life
i
ve
known
a
man
feel
insulted
in
such
a
piece
of
business
by
happening
to
be
in
the
usual
way
more
or
less
swindled
theign
is
unable
to
take
it
in
her
ladyship
explained
that
as
i
ve
heard
it
said
of
all
these
of
the
new
type
bender
simply
can
t
not
to
be
cited
and
celebrated
as
the
biggest
buyer
who
ever
ah
cited
and
celebrated
at
my
say
it
at
once
and
have
it
over
that
i
may
enjoy
what
you
all
want
to
do
to
me
the
dear
man
s
inimitable
at
his
expense
it
was
more
than
lord
john
could
bear
as
he
fairly
flung
himself
off
in
his
derisive
impotence
and
addressed
his
wail
to
lady
sandgate
yes
at
my
expense
is
exactly
what
i
mean
lord
theign
asseverated
at
the
expense
of
my
modest
claim
to
regulate
my
behaviour
by
my
own
standards
there
you
perfectly
about
the
man
and
it
s
precisely
what
i
say
that
he
s
to
hustle
and
harry
me
he
s
a
which
i
never
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
please
understand
when
i
let
you
john
thrust
him
at
me
as
a
pecuniary
resource
at
dedborough
i
didn
t
put
my
property
on
view
that
might
blow
about
it
no
if
you
like
it
lady
sandgate
returned
but
you
certainly
didn
t
so
arrange
she
seemed
to
think
her
point
somehow
would
help
that
you
might
blow
about
it
yourself
nobody
wants
to
blow
lord
john
more
stoutly
interposed
either
hot
or
cold
i
take
it
but
i
really
don
t
see
the
harm
of
bender
s
liking
to
be
known
for
the
scale
of
his
transactions
actual
or
merely
imputed
even
if
you
will
since
that
scale
is
really
so
lady
sandgate
half
accepted
half
qualified
this
plea
the
only
question
perhaps
is
why
he
doesn
t
try
for
some
precious
work
that
somebody
less
delicious
than
dear
theign
be
persuaded
on
bended
knees
to
accept
a
hundred
thousand
try
for
one
her
younger
visitor
took
it
up
while
her
elder
more
attentively
watched
him
that
was
exactly
what
he
did
try
for
when
he
pressed
you
so
hard
in
vain
for
the
great
sir
oh
well
he
mustn
t
come
back
to
must
he
theign
her
ladyship
cooed
that
personage
failed
to
reply
so
that
lord
john
went
on
unconscious
apparently
of
the
still
more
suspicious
study
to
which
he
exposed
himself
besides
which
there
no
things
of
that
magnitude
knocking
about
don
t
you
know
they
ve
to
be
worked
up
first
if
they
re
to
reach
the
grand
publicity
of
the
figure
would
you
mind
he
continued
to
his
noble
monitor
an
agreement
on
some
such
basis
as
that
you
shall
resign
yourself
to
the
biggest
equivalent
you
ll
squeamishly
consent
to
take
if
it
s
at
the
same
time
the
smallest
he
ll
squeamishly
consent
to
offer
but
that
that
done
you
shall
leave
him
free
lady
sandgate
took
it
up
straight
rounding
it
off
as
their
companion
only
waited
leave
him
free
to
talk
about
the
sum
offered
and
the
sum
taken
as
practically
one
and
the
same
ah
you
know
lord
john
discriminated
he
doesn
t
talk
so
much
himself
there
s
really
nothing
blatant
or
crude
about
poor
bender
it
s
the
rate
at
which
by
the
very
way
he
s
fixed
an
awful
way
indeed
i
grant
you
a
perfect
army
of
close
at
his
heels
are
always
talking
for
him
and
of
lord
theign
spoke
hereupon
at
last
with
the
air
as
of
an
impulse
that
had
been
slowly
gathering
force
talk
for
him
my
dear
chap
pretty
well
you
urge
his
case
my
honour
quite
as
if
you
were
assured
of
a
commission
on
the
job
on
a
fine
ascending
scale
has
he
put
you
up
to
that
proposition
eh
you
get
a
handsome
percentage
and
you
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
the
young
man
coloured
under
this
stinging
pleasantry
whether
from
a
good
conscience
affronted
or
from
a
bad
one
made
worse
but
he
otherwise
showed
a
bold
front
only
bending
his
eyes
a
moment
on
his
watch
as
he
s
to
come
to
you
himself
and
i
don
t
know
why
the
mischief
he
doesn
t
come
he
will
answer
you
that
graceful
will
he
answer
it
lord
theign
asked
with
the
veracity
that
the
suggestion
you
ve
just
made
on
his
behalf
represents
him
as
so
beautifully
adhering
to
on
which
he
again
quite
fiercely
turned
his
back
and
recovered
his
detachment
the
others
giving
way
behind
him
to
a
blanker
dismay
lord
john
in
spite
of
this
however
pumped
up
a
tone
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
speak
as
if
i
were
urging
some
then
i
ll
tell
you
why
and
lord
theign
was
upon
him
again
for
the
purpose
because
i
had
rather
give
the
cursed
thing
away
outright
and
for
good
and
all
than
that
it
should
hang
out
there
another
day
in
the
interest
of
such
equivocations
lady
sandgate
s
dismay
yielded
to
her
wonder
and
her
wonder
apparently
in
turn
to
her
amusement
give
it
away
my
dear
friend
to
a
man
who
only
longs
to
smother
you
in
gold
her
dear
friend
however
had
lost
patience
with
her
levity
give
it
away
just
for
a
luxury
of
protest
and
a
stoppage
of
chatter
to
some
cause
as
unlike
as
possible
that
of
bender
s
power
of
sound
and
his
splendid
reputation
to
the
public
to
the
authorities
to
the
thingumbob
to
the
nation
lady
sandgate
broke
into
horror
while
lord
john
stood
sombre
and
stupefied
ah
my
dear
creature
you
ve
flights
of
extravagance
one
thing
s
very
certain
lord
theign
quite
heedlessly
pursued
that
the
thought
of
my
property
on
view
there
does
give
intolerably
on
my
nerves
more
and
more
every
minute
that
i
m
conscious
of
it
so
that
hang
it
if
one
thinks
of
it
why
shouldn
t
i
for
my
relief
do
again
damme
i
that
is
bang
the
door
in
their
faces
have
the
show
immediately
stopped
he
turned
with
the
attraction
of
this
idea
from
one
of
his
listeners
to
the
other
it
s
show
it
isn
t
bender
s
surely
and
i
can
do
just
as
i
choose
with
ah
but
isn
t
that
the
very
point
and
lady
sandgate
put
it
to
lord
john
isn
t
it
bender
s
show
much
more
than
his
her
invoked
authority
however
in
answer
to
this
made
but
a
motion
of
disappointment
and
disgust
at
so
much
rank
folly
while
lord
theign
on
the
other
hand
followed
up
his
happy
thought
then
if
it
s
bender
s
show
or
if
he
claims
it
is
there
s
all
the
more
reason
and
it
took
his
lordship
s
inspiration
no
longer
to
flower
see
here
john
do
this
go
right
round
there
this
moment
please
and
tell
them
from
me
to
shut
straight
down
shut
straight
down
the
young
man
abhorrently
echoed
stop
it
wind
it
up
and
end
it
see
the
more
the
entertainer
of
that
vision
held
it
there
the
more
charm
it
clearly
took
on
for
him
have
the
picture
removed
from
view
and
the
incident
you
seriously
ask
of
me
poor
lord
john
quavered
why
in
the
world
shouldn
t
i
it
s
a
jolly
lot
less
than
you
asked
of
me
a
month
ago
at
what
then
am
i
to
say
to
them
lord
john
spoke
but
after
a
long
moment
during
which
he
had
only
looked
hard
and
an
observer
might
even
then
have
felt
ominously
at
his
taskmaster
that
personage
replied
as
if
wholly
to
have
done
with
the
matter
say
anything
that
comes
into
your
clever
head
i
don
t
really
see
that
there
s
anything
else
you
lady
sandgate
sighed
to
the
messenger
who
gave
no
sign
save
of
positive
stiffness
the
latter
seemed
still
to
weigh
his
displeasing
obligation
then
he
eyed
his
friend
significantly
almost
portentously
those
are
absolutely
your
sentiments
those
are
absolutely
my
sentiments
and
lord
theign
brought
this
out
as
with
the
force
of
a
physical
push
very
well
then
but
the
young
man
indulging
in
a
final
a
fairly
sinister
study
of
such
a
dealer
in
the
arbitrary
made
sure
of
the
extent
whatever
it
was
of
his
own
wrong
not
one
more
day
lord
theign
only
waved
him
away
not
one
more
hour
he
paused
at
the
door
this
reluctant
spokesman
as
if
for
some
supreme
protest
but
after
another
prolonged
and
decisive
engagement
with
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
that
waited
though
differently
on
his
performance
he
clapped
on
his
hat
as
in
the
rage
of
his
resentment
and
departed
on
his
mission
iii
he
can
t
bear
to
do
it
poor
man
lady
ruefully
remarked
to
her
remaining
guest
after
lord
john
had
under
extreme
pressure
dashed
out
to
bond
street
i
dare
say
not
lord
theign
flushed
with
the
felicity
of
made
little
of
that
but
he
goes
too
far
you
see
and
it
clears
the
air
pouah
now
therefore
and
he
glanced
at
the
clock
i
must
go
to
kitty
with
what
kitty
wants
lady
sandgate
opined
won
t
thank
you
for
she
never
thanks
me
for
anything
and
the
fact
of
his
resignation
clearly
added
here
to
his
bitterness
so
it
s
no
great
loss
won
t
you
at
any
rate
his
hostess
asked
wait
for
bender
his
lordship
cast
it
to
the
winds
what
have
i
to
do
with
him
now
why
surely
if
he
ll
accept
your
own
price
lord
theign
thought
he
wondered
and
then
as
if
fairly
amused
at
himself
hanged
if
i
know
what
my
own
price
after
which
he
went
for
his
hat
but
there
s
one
thing
he
remembered
as
he
came
back
with
it
where
s
my
too
unnatural
daughter
if
you
mean
grace
and
really
want
her
i
ll
send
and
find
not
now
he
bethought
himself
but
does
she
that
chatterbox
mr
crimble
yes
she
sees
he
kept
his
eyes
on
her
then
how
far
has
it
gone
lady
sandgate
overcame
an
embarrassment
well
not
even
yet
i
think
so
far
as
they
d
they
d
like
heaven
save
the
mark
to
marry
i
suspect
them
of
it
what
line
if
it
should
come
to
that
she
asked
would
you
then
take
he
was
perfectly
prompt
the
line
that
for
grace
it
s
simply
the
force
of
her
deprecation
of
such
language
was
qualified
by
tact
ah
darling
as
dreadful
as
he
could
but
view
the
possibility
with
dark
resentment
it
lets
us
so
down
from
what
we
ve
always
been
and
done
so
down
down
down
that
i
m
amazed
you
don
t
feel
it
oh
i
feel
there
s
still
plenty
to
keep
you
up
she
soothingly
laughed
he
seemed
to
consider
this
vague
amount
which
he
apparently
judged
however
not
so
vast
as
to
provide
for
the
whole
yearning
of
his
nature
well
my
dear
he
thus
more
blandly
professed
i
shall
need
all
the
extra
that
your
affection
can
if
nothing
could
have
been
on
this
richer
response
nothing
could
at
the
same
time
have
bee
more
pleasing
than
her
modesty
ah
my
affectionate
theign
is
as
i
think
you
know
a
fountain
always
in
flood
but
in
any
more
worldly
element
than
that
as
you
ve
ever
seen
for
yourself
a
poor
strand
with
my
own
sad
affairs
a
broken
reed
not
great
as
they
used
so
finely
to
call
it
you
with
the
natural
sense
of
greatness
and
for
supreme
support
the
instinctive
grand
man
doing
and
taking
he
sighed
none
the
less
he
groaned
with
his
thoughts
of
trouble
for
the
strain
he
foresaw
on
these
resolutions
if
you
mean
that
i
hold
up
my
head
on
higher
grounds
i
grant
that
i
always
have
but
how
much
longer
possible
when
my
children
commit
such
vulgarities
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
are
such
children
what
the
devil
has
got
into
them
and
is
it
really
the
case
that
when
grace
offers
as
a
proof
of
her
license
and
a
specimen
of
her
taste
a
as
you
tell
me
i
m
in
danger
of
helplessly
to
swallow
the
dose
do
you
find
crimble
lady
sandgate
as
if
there
might
really
be
something
to
say
so
utterly
out
of
the
question
i
found
him
on
the
two
occasions
before
i
went
away
in
the
last
degree
offensive
and
outrageous
but
even
if
he
charged
one
and
one
s
poor
dear
decent
old
defences
with
less
rabid
a
fury
everything
about
him
would
forbid
kind
of
what
kind
of
relation
if
any
hugh
s
deficiencies
might
still
render
thinkable
lord
theign
was
kept
from
going
on
to
mention
by
the
voice
of
gotch
who
had
thrown
open
the
door
to
the
not
altogether
assured
sound
of
mr
breckenridge
the
guest
in
possession
gave
a
cry
of
impatience
but
lady
sandgate
said
coming
up
if
his
lordship
will
see
oh
he
s
beyond
his
time
his
lordship
pronounced
i
can
t
see
him
now
ah
but
you
and
mayn
t
then
she
waited
however
for
no
response
to
signify
to
her
servant
let
him
come
and
her
companion
could
but
exhale
a
groan
of
reluctant
accommodation
as
if
he
wondered
at
the
point
she
made
of
it
it
enlightened
him
indeed
perhaps
a
little
that
she
went
on
while
gotch
did
her
bidding
does
the
kind
of
relation
you
d
be
condemned
to
with
crimble
let
you
down
down
down
as
you
say
more
than
the
relation
you
ve
been
having
with
bender
lord
theign
had
for
it
the
most
uninforming
of
stares
do
you
mean
don
t
i
hate
em
equally
both
she
cut
his
further
reply
short
however
by
a
hush
of
warning
bender
was
there
and
his
introducer
had
left
them
lord
theign
full
of
his
purpose
of
departure
sacrificed
hereupon
little
to
ceremony
i
ve
but
a
moment
to
my
regret
to
give
you
bender
and
if
you
ve
been
unavoidably
detained
as
you
great
bustling
people
are
so
apt
to
be
it
will
perhaps
still
be
soon
enough
for
your
comfort
to
hear
from
me
that
i
ve
just
given
order
to
close
our
exhibition
from
the
present
hour
on
sir
he
put
it
with
the
firmness
required
to
settle
the
futility
of
an
appeal
bender
s
large
surprise
lost
itself
however
promptly
enough
in
bender
s
larger
ease
why
do
you
really
mean
it
lord
theign
removing
already
from
view
a
work
that
gives
innocent
gratification
to
thousands
well
said
his
lordship
curtly
if
thousands
have
seen
it
i
ve
done
what
i
wanted
and
if
they
ve
been
gratified
i
m
content
and
invite
to
bender
showed
more
keenness
for
this
richer
implication
in
other
words
it
s
i
who
may
remove
the
picture
well
if
you
ll
take
it
on
my
but
what
lord
theign
all
this
time
bender
almost
pathetically
pleaded
your
estimate
the
parting
guest
had
another
pause
which
prolonged
itself
after
he
had
reached
the
door
in
a
deep
solicitation
of
their
hostess
s
conscious
eyes
this
brief
passage
apparently
inspired
his
answer
lady
sandgate
will
tell
the
door
closed
behind
him
the
charming
woman
smiled
then
at
her
other
friend
whose
comprehensive
presence
appeared
now
to
demand
of
her
some
account
of
these
strange
proceedings
he
means
that
your
own
valuation
is
much
too
shockingly
but
how
can
i
know
much
unless
i
find
out
what
he
ll
take
the
great
collector
s
spirit
had
in
spite
of
its
volume
clearly
not
reached
its
limit
of
expansion
is
he
crazily
waiting
for
the
thing
to
be
proved
what
crimble
claims
no
he
s
waiting
for
nothing
since
he
holds
that
claim
demolished
by
pappendick
s
tremendous
negative
which
you
wrote
to
tell
him
vast
undeveloped
and
suddenly
grave
bender
s
countenance
showed
like
a
barren
tract
under
a
black
cloud
i
wrote
to
fair
and
square
on
but
to
tell
him
i
d
take
the
picture
just
the
same
negative
and
ah
but
take
it
in
that
way
not
for
what
it
is
but
for
what
it
isn
we
know
nothing
about
what
it
isn
t
said
bender
after
all
that
has
happened
we
ve
only
learned
a
little
better
every
day
what
it
you
mean
his
companion
asked
the
biggest
bone
of
artistic
contention
yes
he
took
it
from
her
the
biggest
that
has
been
thrown
into
the
arena
for
quite
a
while
i
guess
i
can
do
with
it
for
lady
sandgate
on
this
after
a
moment
renewed
her
personal
advance
it
was
as
if
she
had
now
made
sure
of
the
soundness
of
her
main
bridge
well
if
it
s
the
biggest
bone
i
won
t
touch
it
i
ll
leave
it
to
be
mauled
by
my
betters
but
since
his
lordship
has
asked
me
to
name
a
price
dear
bender
i
ll
name
one
and
as
you
prefer
big
prices
i
ll
try
to
make
it
suit
you
only
it
won
t
be
for
the
portrait
of
a
person
nobody
is
agreed
about
the
whole
world
is
agreed
you
know
about
my
oh
shucks
lady
sandgate
and
her
visitor
turned
from
her
with
the
hunch
of
overcharged
shoulders
but
she
apparently
felt
that
she
held
him
or
at
least
that
even
if
such
a
conviction
might
be
fatuous
she
must
now
put
it
to
the
touch
you
ve
been
delivered
into
my
hands
too
charmingly
and
you
won
t
really
pretend
that
you
don
t
recognise
that
and
in
fact
rather
like
he
faced
about
to
her
again
as
to
a
case
of
coolness
unparalleled
though
indeed
with
a
quick
lapse
of
real
interest
in
the
question
of
whether
he
had
been
artfully
practised
upon
an
indifference
to
bad
debts
or
peculation
like
that
of
some
huge
hotel
or
other
business
involving
a
margin
for
waste
he
could
afford
he
could
work
waste
too
clearly
and
what
was
it
that
term
you
might
have
felt
him
ask
but
a
mean
measure
anyway
quite
as
the
artful
opposed
to
his
larger
game
would
be
the
hiding
and
pouncing
of
children
at
play
do
i
gather
that
those
uncanny
words
of
his
were
just
meant
to
put
me
off
he
inquired
and
then
as
she
but
boldly
and
smilingly
shrugged
repudiating
responsibility
look
here
lady
sandgate
ain
t
you
honestly
going
to
help
me
he
pursued
this
engaged
her
sincerity
without
affecting
her
gaiety
mr
bender
bender
i
ll
help
you
if
you
ll
help
you
ll
really
get
me
something
from
him
to
go
on
with
i
ll
get
you
something
from
him
to
go
on
that
s
all
i
ask
to
get
then
i
can
move
the
way
i
want
but
without
it
i
m
held
you
shall
have
it
she
replied
if
i
in
turn
may
look
to
for
a
trifle
on
well
he
dryly
gloomed
at
her
what
do
you
call
a
trifle
i
mean
she
waited
but
an
instant
what
you
would
feel
as
that
won
t
do
you
haven
t
the
least
idea
lady
sandgate
he
earnestly
said
i
feel
at
these
foolish
times
i
ve
never
got
used
to
them
ah
don
t
you
understand
she
pressed
that
if
i
give
you
an
advantage
i
m
completely
at
your
mercy
well
what
mercy
he
groaned
do
you
deserve
she
waited
a
little
brightly
composed
then
she
indicated
her
inner
shrine
the
whereabouts
of
her
precious
picture
go
and
look
at
her
again
and
you
ll
his
protest
was
large
but
so
after
a
moment
was
his
compliance
his
heavy
advance
upon
the
other
room
from
just
within
the
doorway
of
which
the
great
lawrence
was
serenely
visible
bender
gave
it
his
eyes
once
more
though
after
the
fashion
verily
of
a
man
for
whom
it
had
now
no
freshness
of
a
glamour
no
shade
of
a
secret
then
he
came
back
to
his
hostess
do
you
call
giving
me
an
advantage
squeezing
me
by
your
sweet
modesty
for
less
than
i
may
possibly
bear
how
can
i
say
fairer
she
returned
than
that
with
my
backing
about
the
other
picture
which
i
ve
passed
you
my
word
for
thrown
in
i
ll
resign
myself
to
whatever
you
may
be
disposed
characteristically
to
give
for
this
if
it
s
a
question
of
resignation
said
bender
you
mean
of
course
what
i
may
be
disposed
characteristically
to
she
played
on
him
for
an
instant
all
her
radiance
yes
then
you
dear
sharp
rich
thing
and
you
take
in
i
assume
he
pursued
that
i
m
just
going
to
lean
on
you
for
what
i
want
with
the
full
weight
of
a
determined
well
she
laughed
i
promise
you
i
ll
thoroughly
obey
the
direction
of
your
all
right
then
and
he
stopped
before
her
in
his
unrest
monumentally
pledged
yet
still
more
massively
immeasurable
how
ll
you
have
it
she
bristled
as
with
all
the
possible
beautiful
choices
then
she
shed
her
selection
as
a
heaving
might
have
dropped
some
round
ripeness
it
was
for
her
friend
to
pick
up
his
plum
and
his
privilege
will
you
write
a
cheque
yes
if
you
want
it
right
to
which
however
he
added
clapping
vainly
a
but
my
s
down
in
my
at
the
door
she
scarce
required
his
assent
to
touch
a
bell
i
can
easily
send
for
and
she
threw
off
while
they
waited
it
s
so
sweet
your
flying
round
with
your
he
put
it
with
promptitude
another
way
it
flies
round
pretty
well
with
mr
bender
s
in
his
car
she
went
on
to
gotch
who
had
answered
her
summons
the
owner
of
the
interesting
object
further
instructed
him
you
ll
find
in
the
pocket
a
large
red
morocco
very
good
sir
said
gotch
but
with
another
word
for
his
mistress
lord
john
would
like
to
know
lord
john
s
there
she
interrupted
gotch
turned
to
the
open
door
here
he
is
my
she
accommodated
herself
at
once
under
bender
s
eye
to
the
complication
involved
in
his
lordship
s
presence
it
s
he
who
went
round
to
bond
bender
stared
but
saw
the
connection
to
stop
the
show
and
then
as
the
young
man
was
already
there
you
ve
stopped
the
show
it
s
on
more
than
ever
lord
john
responded
while
gotch
retired
a
hurried
flurried
breathless
lord
john
strikingly
different
from
the
backward
messenger
she
had
lately
seen
despatched
but
theign
should
be
here
he
addressed
her
excitedly
i
announce
you
a
call
from
the
the
prince
she
gasped
as
for
the
burden
of
the
honour
he
follows
you
bender
with
an
eagerness
and
a
candour
there
was
no
mistaking
recognised
on
behalf
of
his
ampler
action
a
world
of
associational
advantage
and
auspicious
possibility
is
the
prince
the
thing
lord
john
remained
in
spite
of
this
challenge
conscious
of
nothing
but
his
message
he
was
there
with
mackintosh
to
see
and
admire
the
picture
which
he
thinks
by
the
way
a
mantovano
pure
and
simple
and
did
me
the
honour
to
remember
me
when
he
heard
me
report
to
mackintosh
in
his
presence
the
sentiments
expressed
to
me
here
by
our
noble
friend
and
of
which
embarrassed
though
i
doubtless
was
the
young
man
pursued
to
lady
sandgate
i
gave
as
clear
an
account
as
i
could
he
was
so
delighted
with
it
that
he
declared
they
mustn
t
think
then
of
taking
the
thing
off
but
must
on
the
contrary
keep
putting
it
forward
for
all
it
s
worth
and
he
would
come
round
and
congratulate
and
thank
theign
and
explain
him
his
their
hostess
cast
about
for
a
sign
why
theign
is
at
kitty
s
worse
luck
the
prince
calls
on
him
he
calls
you
see
on
my
lady
at
and
graciously
desired
me
so
to
put
it
he
s
very
kind
but
she
took
in
her
condition
i
m
not
even
you
ll
have
time
the
young
man
was
a
comfort
while
i
rush
to
berkeley
square
and
pardon
me
bender
though
it
s
so
near
if
i
just
bag
your
that
s
that
s
it
take
his
car
lady
sandgate
almost
swept
him
away
you
may
use
my
car
all
right
bender
contributed
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
the
man
s
the
man
what
man
his
friend
scarce
paused
to
ask
the
prince
then
if
you
allow
he
a
man
is
he
after
my
picture
lord
john
vividly
disclaimed
authority
if
you
ll
wait
my
dear
fellow
you
ll
oh
why
should
he
wait
burst
from
their
cautious
companion
only
to
be
caught
up
however
in
the
next
breath
so
swift
her
gracious
revolution
wait
wait
indeed
bender
i
won
t
give
you
up
for
any
prince
with
which
she
appealed
again
to
lord
john
he
wants
to
congratulate
on
theign
s
decision
as
i
ve
told
you
which
i
announced
to
mackintosh
by
theign
s
extraordinary
order
under
his
highness
s
nose
and
which
his
highness
by
the
same
token
took
up
like
a
her
face
as
she
bethought
herself
was
convulsed
as
by
some
quick
perception
of
what
her
informant
must
have
done
and
what
therefore
the
prince
s
interest
rested
on
all
however
to
the
effect
given
their
actual
company
of
her
at
once
dodging
and
covering
that
issue
the
decision
to
remove
the
picture
lord
john
also
observed
a
discretion
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
such
a
thing
says
it
must
stay
stock
still
so
there
you
are
this
determined
in
bender
a
not
unnatural
in
fact
quite
a
clamorous
series
of
questions
but
are
we
and
what
has
the
prince
to
do
with
lord
theign
s
decision
when
that
s
all
here
for
what
in
thunder
lord
theign
s
decision
what
was
his
extraordinary
order
lord
john
too
long
detained
and
his
hand
now
on
the
door
put
off
this
solicitor
as
he
had
already
been
put
off
lady
sandgate
tell
him
i
rush
bender
saw
him
vanish
but
all
to
a
greater
bewilderment
what
the
h
then
i
beg
your
pardon
is
he
talking
about
and
what
sentiments
did
he
report
round
there
that
lord
theign
had
been
expressing
his
hostess
faced
it
not
otherwise
than
if
she
had
resolved
not
to
recognise
the
subject
of
his
curiosity
for
fear
of
other
recognitions
they
put
everything
on
my
dear
man
but
i
haven
t
the
least
he
looked
at
her
askance
then
why
does
the
fellow
say
you
have
much
at
a
loss
for
the
moment
she
yet
found
her
way
because
the
fellow
s
so
agog
that
he
doesn
t
know
he
says
in
addition
to
which
she
was
relieved
by
the
reappearance
of
gotch
who
bore
on
a
salver
the
object
he
had
been
sent
for
and
to
which
he
duly
called
attention
the
large
red
morocco
lady
sandgate
fairly
jumped
at
it
your
blessed
lay
it
on
my
desk
she
said
to
gotch
though
waiting
till
he
had
departed
again
before
she
resumed
to
her
visitor
mightn
t
we
conclude
before
he
comes
the
prince
bender
s
imagination
had
strayed
from
the
ground
to
which
she
sought
to
lead
it
back
and
it
but
vaguely
retraced
its
steps
will
want
your
well
he
may
when
he
sees
her
lady
sandgate
laughed
and
theign
when
he
comes
will
give
you
on
his
own
question
i
feel
sure
every
information
shall
i
fish
it
out
for
you
she
encouragingly
asked
beside
him
by
her
at
which
he
had
arrived
under
her
persuasive
guidance
and
where
she
sought
solidly
to
establish
him
opening
out
the
gilded
crimson
case
for
his
employ
so
that
he
had
but
to
help
himself
what
enormous
cheques
can
never
draw
one
for
that
s
exactly
what
you
deserve
i
do
he
remained
after
this
solemnly
still
however
like
some
circled
with
ceremonies
in
consonance
with
which
the
next
moment
both
her
hands
held
out
to
him
the
open
and
immaculate
page
of
the
oblong
series
much
as
they
might
have
presented
a
royal
infant
at
the
he
failed
in
his
preoccupation
to
receive
it
so
she
placed
it
before
him
on
the
table
coming
away
with
a
brave
gay
well
i
leave
it
to
you
she
had
not
restlessly
revolving
kept
her
discreet
distance
for
many
minutes
before
she
found
herself
almost
face
to
face
with
the
recurrent
gotch
upright
at
the
door
with
a
fresh
announcement
mr
crimble
please
for
lady
mr
crimble
she
took
it
discomposedly
it
reached
bender
at
the
secretary
but
to
a
different
effect
mr
crimble
why
he
s
just
the
man
i
want
to
see
gotch
turning
to
the
lobby
had
only
to
make
way
for
him
here
he
is
my
then
tell
her
she
has
come
down
said
gotch
while
hugh
arrived
and
his
companion
withdrew
and
while
lady
grace
reaching
the
scene
from
the
other
quarter
emerged
in
bright
equipment
in
her
hat
scarf
and
gloves
iv
these
young
persons
were
thus
at
once
confronted
across
the
room
and
the
girl
explained
her
preparation
i
was
listening
hard
for
your
knock
and
your
then
know
that
thank
god
it
s
all
right
hugh
was
breathless
jubilant
radiant
a
mantovano
she
delightedly
cried
a
mantovano
he
proudly
gave
back
a
mantovano
it
carried
even
lady
sandgate
away
a
mantovano
a
sure
thing
bender
jumped
up
from
his
business
all
gaping
attention
to
hugh
i
ve
just
left
our
blest
bardi
said
that
young
man
who
hasn
t
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
is
delighted
to
publish
it
will
he
publish
it
right
here
to
bender
hungrily
asked
well
hugh
smiled
you
can
try
but
try
him
how
where
the
great
collector
straining
to
instant
action
cast
about
for
his
hat
where
he
hey
don
t
you
wish
i
d
tell
you
hugh
in
his
personal
elation
almost
cynically
answered
won
t
you
wait
for
the
prince
lady
sandgate
had
meanwhile
asked
of
her
friend
but
had
turned
more
inspectingly
to
lady
grace
before
he
could
reply
my
dear
child
though
you
re
lovely
are
you
sure
you
re
ready
for
him
for
the
prince
the
girl
was
vague
is
he
coming
at
with
which
she
consulted
her
bracelet
watch
but
only
at
once
to
wail
for
alarm
ah
it
that
and
i
m
not
dressed
she
hurried
off
through
the
other
room
bender
quite
accepting
her
retreat
addressed
himself
again
unabashed
to
hugh
it
s
your
blest
bardi
i
want
first
i
ll
take
the
prince
the
young
man
clearly
could
afford
indulgence
now
then
i
left
him
at
long
s
why
right
near
i
ll
come
and
bender
s
flight
was
on
the
wings
of
optimism
but
it
all
gave
hugh
a
quick
question
for
lady
grace
why
does
the
prince
come
and
what
in
the
world
s
happening
my
father
has
suddenly
returned
it
may
have
to
do
with
the
shadow
of
his
surprise
darkened
visibly
to
that
of
his
fear
mayn
t
it
be
more
than
anything
else
to
give
you
and
me
his
final
curse
i
don
t
know
and
i
think
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
care
she
said
so
long
as
you
re
right
and
as
the
greatest
light
of
all
declares
you
he
the
greatest
hugh
was
vividly
of
that
opinion
now
i
could
see
it
as
soon
as
i
got
there
with
him
the
charming
creature
there
the
holy
thing
and
with
the
place
by
good
luck
for
those
great
moments
practically
to
ourselves
without
macintosh
to
take
in
what
was
happening
or
any
one
else
at
all
to
speak
of
it
was
but
a
matter
of
ten
minutes
he
had
come
he
had
seen
and
had
naturally
you
had
the
girl
hung
on
him
for
it
and
what
was
happening
beyond
everything
else
was
that
for
your
original
dear
divination
one
of
the
divinations
of
genius
with
every
creature
all
these
ages
so
stupid
you
were
being
baptized
on
the
spot
a
great
well
he
did
let
poor
pappendick
have
it
at
doesn
t
think
one
that
that
eminent
judge
couldn
t
even
with
such
a
leg
up
rise
to
my
level
or
seize
my
point
and
if
you
really
want
to
know
hugh
went
on
in
his
gladness
what
for
has
most
particularly
and
preciously
taken
place
it
is
that
in
his
opinion
for
my
career
your
reputation
she
cried
blazes
out
and
your
fortune
s
made
he
did
a
happy
violence
to
his
modesty
well
bardi
adores
intelligence
and
takes
off
his
hat
to
then
you
need
take
off
yours
to
nobody
such
was
lady
grace
s
proud
opinion
but
i
should
like
to
take
off
mine
to
she
added
which
i
seem
to
have
put
on
to
get
out
and
away
with
you
expressly
for
hugh
as
he
looked
her
over
took
it
up
in
bliss
ah
we
ll
go
forth
together
to
him
then
thanks
to
your
happy
splendid
impulse
and
you
ll
back
him
gorgeously
up
in
the
good
he
thinks
of
his
friend
yet
had
on
this
a
sombre
second
thought
the
only
thing
is
that
our
awful
american
but
he
warned
her
with
a
raised
hand
not
to
speak
of
our
awful
briton
for
the
door
had
opened
from
the
lobby
admitting
lord
theign
unattended
who
at
sight
of
his
daughter
and
her
companion
pulled
up
and
held
them
a
minute
in
reprehensive
view
all
at
least
till
hugh
undauntedly
indeed
quite
cheerfully
greeted
him
since
you
find
me
again
in
your
path
my
lord
it
s
because
i
ve
a
small
but
precious
document
to
deliver
you
if
you
ll
allow
me
to
do
so
which
i
feel
it
important
myself
to
place
in
your
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
and
extracted
thence
a
small
unsealed
envelope
retaining
the
latter
a
trifle
helplessly
in
his
hand
while
lord
theign
only
opposed
to
this
demonstration
an
unmitigated
blankness
he
went
none
the
less
bravely
on
i
mentioned
to
you
the
last
time
we
somewhat
infelicitously
met
that
i
intended
to
appeal
to
another
and
probably
more
closely
qualified
artistic
authority
on
the
subject
of
your
moretto
and
i
in
fact
saw
the
picture
half
an
hour
ago
with
bardi
of
milan
who
there
in
presence
of
it
did
absolute
did
ideal
justice
as
i
had
hoped
to
the
claim
i
ve
been
making
i
then
went
with
him
to
his
hotel
close
at
hand
where
he
dashed
me
off
this
brief
and
rapid
but
quite
conclusive
declaration
which
if
you
ll
be
so
good
as
to
read
it
will
enable
you
perhaps
to
join
us
in
regarding
the
vexed
question
as
his
lordship
having
faced
this
speech
without
a
sign
rested
on
the
speaker
a
somewhat
more
confessed
intelligence
then
looked
hard
at
the
offered
note
and
hard
at
the
floor
all
to
avert
himself
actively
afterward
and
with
his
head
a
good
deal
elevated
add
to
his
distance
as
it
were
from
every
one
and
everything
so
indelicately
thrust
on
his
attention
this
movement
had
an
ambiguous
makeshift
air
yet
his
companions
under
the
impression
of
it
exchanged
a
hopeless
look
his
daughter
none
the
less
lifted
her
voice
if
you
won
t
take
what
he
has
for
you
from
crimble
father
will
you
take
it
from
me
and
then
as
after
some
apparent
debate
he
appeared
to
decide
to
heed
her
it
may
be
so
long
again
she
said
before
you
ve
a
chance
to
do
a
thing
i
the
chance
will
depend
on
yourself
he
returned
with
high
dry
emphasis
but
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
note
hugh
had
given
her
and
with
which
she
approached
him
and
though
face
to
face
they
seemed
more
separated
than
brought
near
by
this
contact
without
commerce
she
turned
away
on
one
side
when
he
had
taken
the
missive
as
hugh
had
turned
away
on
the
other
lord
theign
drew
forth
the
contents
of
the
envelope
and
broodingly
and
inexpressively
read
the
few
lines
after
which
as
having
done
justice
to
their
sense
he
thrust
the
paper
forth
again
till
his
daughter
became
aware
and
received
it
she
restored
it
to
her
friend
while
her
father
dandled
off
anew
but
coming
round
this
time
almost
as
by
a
circuit
of
the
room
and
meeting
hugh
who
took
advantage
of
it
to
repeat
by
a
frank
gesture
his
offer
of
bardi
s
attestation
lord
theign
passed
with
the
young
man
on
this
a
couple
of
mute
minutes
of
the
same
order
as
those
he
had
passed
with
lady
grace
in
the
same
connection
their
eyes
dealt
deeply
with
their
eyes
but
to
the
effect
of
his
lordship
s
accepting
the
gift
which
after
another
minute
he
had
slipped
into
his
it
was
not
till
then
that
he
brought
out
a
curt
but
resonant
thank
you
while
the
others
awaited
his
further
pleasure
he
again
bethought
himself
then
he
addressed
lady
grace
i
must
let
bender
know
mr
bender
hugh
interposed
does
know
he
s
at
the
present
moment
with
the
author
of
that
note
at
long
s
then
i
must
now
write
him
and
his
lordship
while
he
spoke
and
from
where
he
stood
looked
in
refined
disconnectedness
out
of
the
window
will
you
write
and
his
daughter
indicated
lady
sandgate
s
desk
at
which
we
have
seen
bender
so
importantly
seated
lord
theign
had
a
start
at
her
again
speaking
to
him
but
he
bent
his
view
on
the
convenience
awaiting
him
and
then
as
to
have
done
with
so
tiresome
a
matter
took
advantage
of
it
he
went
and
placed
himself
and
had
reached
for
paper
and
a
pen
when
struck
apparently
with
the
display
of
some
incongruous
object
he
uttered
a
sharp
hallo
you
don
t
find
things
lady
grace
asked
as
remote
from
him
in
one
quarter
of
the
room
as
hugh
was
in
another
on
the
contrary
he
oddly
replied
but
plainly
suppressing
any
further
surprise
he
committed
a
few
words
to
paper
and
put
them
into
an
envelope
which
he
addressed
and
brought
away
if
you
like
said
hugh
urbanely
i
ll
carry
him
that
but
how
do
you
know
what
it
consists
of
i
don
t
know
but
i
risk
his
lordship
weighed
the
proposition
in
a
high
impersonal
manner
he
even
nervously
weighed
his
letter
shaking
it
with
one
hand
upon
the
of
the
other
after
which
as
finally
to
acquit
himself
of
any
measurable
obligation
he
allowed
hugh
by
a
surrender
of
the
interesting
object
to
redeem
his
offer
of
service
then
you
ll
learn
he
simply
said
and
may
learn
asked
lady
grace
you
the
tone
made
so
light
of
her
that
it
was
barely
interrogative
may
i
go
him
her
father
looked
at
the
question
as
at
some
cup
of
supreme
bitterness
a
nasty
and
now
quite
regular
dose
with
which
his
lips
were
familiar
but
before
which
their
first
movement
was
always
tightly
to
close
me
my
lord
said
hugh
at
last
thoroughly
determined
they
should
open
and
intensifying
the
emphasis
he
had
his
effect
and
lord
theign
s
answer
addressed
to
lady
grace
made
indifference
very
comprehensive
you
may
do
what
ever
you
dreadfully
like
at
this
then
the
girl
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
present
her
choice
as
absolutely
taken
reached
the
door
which
hugh
had
come
across
to
open
for
her
here
she
paused
as
for
another
a
last
look
at
her
father
and
her
expression
seemed
to
say
to
him
unaidedly
that
much
as
she
would
have
preferred
to
proceed
to
her
act
without
this
gross
disorder
she
could
yet
find
inspiration
too
in
the
very
difficulty
and
the
old
faiths
themselves
that
he
left
her
to
struggle
with
all
this
made
for
depth
and
beauty
in
her
serious
young
face
as
it
had
indeed
a
force
that
not
indistinguishably
after
an
instant
his
lordship
lost
any
wish
for
longer
exposure
to
his
shift
of
his
attitude
before
she
went
out
was
fairly
an
evasion
if
the
extent
of
the
levity
of
one
of
his
daughter
s
made
him
afraid
what
might
have
been
his
present
strange
sense
but
a
fear
of
the
other
from
the
extent
of
her
gravity
lady
grace
passes
from
us
at
any
rate
in
her
laced
and
pearled
and
plumed
slimness
and
her
pale
concentration
leaving
her
friend
a
moment
however
with
his
hand
on
the
door
you
thanked
me
just
now
for
bardi
s
opinion
after
all
hugh
said
with
a
smile
and
it
seems
to
me
that
after
all
as
well
i
ve
grounds
for
thanking
you
on
which
he
left
his
benefactor
alone
tit
for
tat
there
broke
from
lord
theign
in
his
solitude
with
the
young
man
out
of
earshot
that
vague
ironic
comment
which
only
served
his
turn
none
the
less
till
bethinking
himself
he
had
gone
back
to
the
piece
of
furniture
used
for
his
late
scribble
and
come
away
from
it
again
the
next
minute
delicately
holding
a
fair
slip
that
we
naturally
recognise
as
bender
s
forgotten
cheque
this
apparently
surprising
value
he
now
studied
at
his
ease
and
to
the
point
of
its
even
drawing
from
him
an
articulate
what
in
damnation
his
speculation
dropped
before
the
return
of
his
hostess
whose
approach
through
the
other
room
fell
upon
his
ear
and
whom
he
awaited
after
a
quick
thrust
of
the
cheque
into
his
waistcoat
lady
sandgate
appeared
now
in
due
that
is
in
the
most
happily
adjusted
splendour
she
had
changed
her
dress
for
something
smarter
and
more
appropriate
to
the
entertainment
of
princes
tea
will
be
downstairs
she
said
but
you
re
alone
i
ve
just
parted
her
friend
replied
with
grace
and
parted
with
them
the
ambiguity
struck
her
well
they
ve
gone
out
together
to
flaunt
their
monstrous
connection
you
speak
she
laughed
as
if
it
were
too
gross
i
they
re
surely
coming
back
back
to
you
if
you
like
but
not
to
ah
what
are
you
and
i
she
tenderly
argued
but
one
and
the
same
quantity
and
though
you
may
not
as
yet
absolutely
rejoice
in
well
whatever
they
re
doing
she
cheerfully
added
you
ll
get
beautifully
used
to
that
s
just
what
i
m
afraid
of
what
such
horrid
matters
make
of
one
at
the
worst
then
you
see
she
maintained
her
optimism
the
recipient
of
royal
attentions
oh
said
her
companion
whom
his
honour
seemed
to
leave
comparatively
cold
it
s
simply
as
if
the
gracious
personage
were
coming
to
condole
impatient
of
the
lapse
of
time
in
any
case
she
assured
herself
again
of
the
hour
well
if
he
only
does
come
john
the
wretch
lord
theign
returned
will
take
care
of
that
he
has
nailed
him
and
will
bring
what
was
it
then
his
friend
found
occasion
in
the
particular
tone
of
this
reference
to
demand
what
was
it
that
when
you
sent
him
off
john
spoke
of
you
in
bond
street
as
specifically
intending
oh
he
saw
it
now
all
lucidly
if
not
rather
luridly
and
thereby
the
more
tragically
he
described
me
in
his
nasty
rage
as
consistently
well
heroic
his
rage
she
pieced
it
sympathetically
out
at
your
destroying
his
cherished
credit
with
bender
lord
theign
was
more
and
more
possessed
of
this
view
of
the
manner
of
it
i
had
come
between
him
and
some
profit
that
he
doesn
t
confess
to
but
that
made
him
viciously
and
vindictively
serve
me
up
there
as
he
caught
the
chance
to
the
prince
and
the
people
she
cast
about
in
her
intimate
interest
as
for
some
closer
conception
of
it
by
saying
that
you
had
remarked
here
that
you
offered
the
people
the
picture
as
a
sacrifice
yes
to
morbid
though
respectable
to
which
he
sharply
added
as
if
struck
with
her
easy
grasp
of
the
scene
but
i
hope
you
ve
nothing
to
call
a
memory
for
any
such
extravagance
lady
sandgate
waited
then
boldly
took
her
line
none
whatever
you
had
reacted
against
bender
but
you
hadn
t
gone
so
far
as
he
had
it
now
all
vividly
before
him
i
had
reacted
like
a
gentleman
but
it
didn
t
thereby
follow
that
i
acted
or
spoke
like
a
demagogue
and
my
mind
s
a
complete
blank
on
the
subject
of
my
having
done
so
that
there
only
flushes
through
your
conscience
she
suggested
the
fact
that
he
has
forced
your
hand
fevered
with
the
sore
sense
of
it
his
lordship
wiped
his
brow
he
has
played
me
for
spite
his
damned
impertinent
trick
she
found
but
after
a
minute
for
it
wasn
t
easy
the
right
word
or
the
least
wrong
for
the
situation
well
even
if
he
did
so
diabolically
commit
you
you
still
don
t
want
do
you
to
back
out
resenting
the
suggestion
which
restored
all
his
nobler
form
lord
theign
fairly
drew
himself
up
when
did
i
ever
in
all
my
life
back
out
never
never
in
all
your
life
of
course
she
dashed
a
bucketful
at
the
flare
and
the
picture
after
all
the
picture
after
all
he
took
her
up
in
cold
grim
gallant
despair
has
just
been
pronounced
definitely
and
then
to
meet
her
gaping
ignorance
by
crimble
s
latest
and
apparently
greatest
adviser
who
strongly
stamps
it
a
mantovano
and
whose
practical
affidavit
i
now
poor
lady
sandgate
gaped
but
the
more
she
wondered
and
yearned
definitely
priceless
definitely
after
which
he
took
from
its
place
of
lurking
considerately
unfolding
it
the
goodly
slip
he
had
removed
from
her
worth
even
more
therefore
than
what
bender
so
blatantly
her
attention
fell
with
interest
from
the
distance
at
which
she
stood
on
this
confirmatory
document
her
recognition
of
which
was
not
immediate
and
is
that
the
affidavit
this
is
a
cheque
to
your
order
my
lady
for
ten
thousand
ten
thousand
she
echoed
it
with
a
shout
drawn
by
some
hand
unknown
he
went
on
quietly
unknown
again
in
her
muffled
joy
she
let
it
sound
out
which
i
found
there
at
your
desk
a
moment
ago
and
thought
best
in
your
interest
to
rescue
from
accident
or
neglect
even
though
it
be
save
for
the
single
stroke
of
a
name
begun
he
wound
up
with
his
look
like
a
playing
searchlight
unhappily
unsigned
the
exhibition
of
her
design
of
her
defeat
kept
shaking
her
then
it
isn
t
good
it
s
a
barmecide
feast
my
dear
he
had
still
her
kind
friend
his
note
of
grimness
and
also
his
penetration
of
eye
but
who
is
it
writes
you
colossal
cheques
and
then
leaves
them
lying
about
her
case
was
so
bad
that
you
would
have
seen
how
she
felt
she
must
something
something
quite
splendid
she
recovered
herself
she
faced
the
situation
with
all
her
bright
bravery
of
expression
and
aspect
conscious
you
might
have
guessed
that
she
had
never
more
strikingly
embodied
on
such
lines
the
elegant
the
beautiful
and
the
true
why
who
can
it
have
been
but
poor
breckenridge
too
breckenridge
lord
theign
had
smart
echoes
what
in
the
world
does
he
owe
you
money
for
it
took
her
but
an
instant
more
she
performed
the
great
repudiation
quite
as
she
might
be
prepared
to
sweep
in
the
presence
impending
her
grandest
curtsey
you
sweet
suspicious
thing
for
my
and
then
as
his
glare
didn
t
fade
bender
makes
my
life
a
burden
for
the
love
of
my
precious
which
you
re
weakly
letting
him
grab
nothing
could
have
been
finer
with
this
than
lord
theign
s
reprobation
unless
it
had
been
his
surprise
she
shook
her
head
as
in
bland
compassion
for
such
an
idea
it
isn
t
a
payment
you
goose
it
s
a
bribe
i
ve
withstood
him
these
trying
weeks
as
a
rock
the
tempest
but
he
wrote
that
and
left
it
there
the
fiend
to
tempt
me
to
corrupt
me
without
putting
his
name
her
companion
again
turned
over
the
cheque
she
bethought
herself
clearly
with
all
her
genius
as
to
this
anomaly
and
the
light
of
reality
broke
he
must
have
been
interrupted
in
the
artful
act
he
sprang
up
with
such
a
bound
at
crimble
s
news
at
once
then
for
his
interest
in
it
he
hurried
off
leaving
the
cheque
forgotten
and
she
smiled
more
intensely
her
eyes
attached
as
from
fascination
to
the
morsel
of
paper
still
handled
by
her
friend
but
of
course
on
his
next
visit
he
ll
his
great
the
devil
he
will
and
lord
theign
with
the
highest
spirit
tore
the
crisp
token
into
several
pieces
which
fluttered
as
worthless
now
as
pure
snowflakes
to
the
floor
ay
ay
ay
it
drew
from
her
a
wail
of
which
the
character
for
its
sharp
inconsequence
was
yet
comic
this
renewed
his
stare
at
her
do
want
to
back
out
i
mean
from
your
noble
as
quickly
however
she
had
saved
herself
i
d
rather
do
even
what
you
re
doing
offer
my
treasure
to
the
thingumbob
he
was
touched
by
this
even
to
sympathy
will
you
then
me
in
setting
the
example
of
a
great
donation
to
the
she
extravagantly
smiled
i
call
it
he
said
with
dignity
the
national
she
closed
her
eyes
as
with
a
failure
of
breath
ah
my
dear
friend
it
would
convince
me
he
went
on
insistent
and
persuasive
of
the
sincerity
of
my
affection
she
drew
nearer
to
him
it
would
comfort
me
he
was
satisfied
with
his
own
expression
yet
in
a
moment
when
she
had
come
all
rustlingly
and
fragrantly
close
it
would
captivate
me
he
handsomely
added
it
would
captivate
you
it
was
for
we
should
have
seen
to
be
satisfied
with
his
expression
and
with
our
more
informed
observation
of
all
it
was
a
question
of
her
giving
up
she
would
have
struck
us
as
subtly
bargaining
he
gallantly
amplified
it
would
peculiarly
by
which
i
mean
it
would
so
naturally
unite
us
well
that
was
all
she
wanted
then
for
a
complete
union
with
you
of
fact
as
well
as
of
fond
fancy
she
smiled
there
s
nothing
even
to
my
one
ewe
lamb
i
m
not
ready
to
ah
we
don
t
surrender
he
urged
we
enjoy
yes
she
understood
with
the
glory
of
our
grand
gift
thrown
we
quite
swagger
he
gravely
observed
though
even
swaggering
would
after
this
be
dull
without
oh
i
ll
with
you
she
cried
as
if
it
quite
settled
and
made
up
for
everything
and
then
impatiently
as
she
beheld
lord
john
whom
the
door
had
burst
open
to
admit
the
prince
the
prince
the
young
man
launched
it
as
a
call
to
arms
they
had
fallen
apart
on
the
irruption
the
pair
discovered
but
she
flashed
straight
at
her
lover
then
we
can
swagger
now
lord
theign
had
reached
the
open
door
i
meet
him
demurring
debating
however
she
stayed
him
a
moment
but
oughtn
t
i
in
my
own
house
his
lordship
caught
her
meaning
you
mean
he
may
think
but
he
as
easily
pronounced
he
shall
think
the
truth
and
with
a
kiss
of
his
hand
to
her
he
was
gone
lord
john
who
had
gazed
in
some
wonder
at
these
demonstrations
was
quickly
about
to
follow
but
she
checked
him
with
an
authority
she
had
never
before
used
and
which
was
clearly
the
next
moment
to
prove
irresistible
lord
john
be
so
good
as
to
looking
about
at
the
condition
of
a
room
on
the
point
of
receiving
so
august
a
character
she
observed
on
the
floor
the
fragments
of
the
torn
cheque
to
which
she
sharply
pointed
and
please
pick
up
that
litter
the
end
