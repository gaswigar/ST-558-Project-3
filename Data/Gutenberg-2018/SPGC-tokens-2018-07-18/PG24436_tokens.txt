cher

gascé
a
man
whom
i
may
truly
call
my
brother
like
some
great
fish
the
ship
sang
on
through
the
eternal
night
there
was
no
impression
of
swimming
the
fish
shape
had
neither
fins
nor
a
tail
it
was
as
though
it
were
hovering
in
wait
for
a
member
of
some
smaller
species
to
swoop
suddenly
down
from
nowhere
so
that
it
in
turn
could
pounce
and
kill
but
still
it
moved
and
sang
only
a
being
who
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
type
could
have
told
that
this
particular
fish
was
dying
in
shape
the
ship
was
rather
like
a
narrow
flounder
long
tapered
and
oval
in
but
it
showed
none
of
the
exterior
markings
one
might
expect
of
either
a
living
thing
or
a
spaceship
with
one
exception
the
smooth
exterior
was
featureless
that
one
exception
was
a
long
roughened
discoloration
that
ran
along
one
side
for
almost
half
of
the
ship
seventeen
meters
of
length
it
was
the
only
external
sign
that
the
ship
was
dying
inside
the
ship
the
nipe
neither
knew
nor
cared
about
the
discoloration
had
he
thought
about
it
he
would
have
deduced
the
presence
of
the
burn
but
it
was
by
far
the
least
of
his
worries
the
ship
sang
and
the
song
was
a
song
of
death
the
internal
damage
that
had
been
done
to
the
ship
was
far
more
serious
than
the
burn
on
the
surface
of
the
hull
it
was
that
internal
damage
which
occupied
the
thoughts
of
the
nipe
for
it
could
quite
possibly
kill
him
he
had
of
course
no
intention
of
dying
not
out
here
not
so
far
so
very
far
from
his
own
people
not
out
here
where
his
death
would
be
so
very
improper
he
looked
at
the
ball
of
the
sun
ahead
and
wondered
that
such
a
relatively
stable
inactive
star
could
have
produced
such
a
tremendously
energetic
plasmoid
one
that
could
still
do
such
damage
so
far
out
it
had
been
a
freak
of
course
such
suns
as
this
did
not
normally
produce
such
energetic
swirls
of
magnetohydrodynamic
force
but
the
thing
had
been
there
nonetheless
and
the
ship
had
hit
it
at
high
velocity
fortunately
the
ship
had
only
touched
the
edge
of
the
swirling
cloud
otherwise
the
ship
would
have
vanished
in
a
puff
of
incandescence
but
it
had
done
enough
the
power
plants
that
drove
the
ship
at
ultralight
velocities
through
the
depths
of
interstellar
space
had
been
so
badly
damaged
that
they
could
only
be
used
in
short
bursts
and
each
burst
brought
them
closer
to
the
fusion
point
even
when
they
were
not
being
used
they
sang
away
their
energies
in
ululations
of
wavering
vibration
that
would
have
been
to
a
human
being
the
nipe
had
heard
the
singing
of
the
engines
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
realized
that
he
could
do
nothing
about
it
and
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
most
of
the
instruments
were
powerless
the
nipe
was
not
even
sure
he
could
land
the
vessel
any
attempt
to
use
the
communicator
to
call
home
would
have
blown
his
ship
to
atoms
the
nipe
did
not
want
to
die
but
if
die
he
must
he
did
not
want
to
die
foolishly
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
drift
in
from
the
outer
reaches
of
this
sun
planetary
system
but
using
the
power
plants
any
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
would
have
been
foolhardy
the
nipe
missed
the
companionship
his
brother
had
given
him
for
so
long
his
help
would
be
invaluable
now
but
there
had
been
no
choice
there
had
not
been
enough
supplies
for
two
to
survive
the
long
inward
fall
toward
the
distant
sun
the
nipe
having
discovered
the
fact
first
had
out
of
his
mercy
and
compassion
killed
his
brother
while
the
other
was
not
looking
then
having
disposed
of
his
brother
with
all
due
ceremony
he
had
settled
down
to
the
long
lonely
wait
beings
of
another
race
might
have
cursed
the
accident
that
had
disabled
the
ship
or
regretted
the
necessity
that
one
of
them
should
die
but
the
nipe
did
neither
for
to
him
the
first
notion
would
have
been
foolish
and
the
second
incomprehensible
but
now
as
the
ship
fell
ever
closer
toward
the
sun
he
began
to
worry
about
his
own
fate
for
a
while
it
had
seemed
almost
certain
that
he
would
survive
long
enough
to
build
a
communicator
for
the
instruments
had
already
told
him
and
his
brother
that
the
system
ahead
was
inhabited
by
creatures
of
reasoning
power
if
not
true
intelligence
and
it
would
almost
certainly
be
possible
to
get
the
equipment
he
needed
from
them
now
though
it
looked
as
if
the
ship
would
not
survive
a
landing
he
had
had
to
steer
it
away
from
a
great
gas
giant
which
had
seriously
endangered
the
power
plants
he
did
not
want
to
die
in
space
wasted
forever
undevoured
at
least
he
must
die
on
a
planet
where
there
might
be
creatures
with
the
compassion
and
wisdom
to
give
his
body
the
proper
death
rites
the
thought
of
succumbing
to
inferior
creatures
was
repugnant
but
it
was
better
than
rotting
to
feed
monocells
or
ectogenes
and
far
superior
to
wasting
away
in
space
even
thoughts
such
as
these
did
not
occupy
his
mind
often
or
for
very
long
far
far
better
than
any
of
those
thoughts
were
thoughts
connected
with
the
desire
and
planning
for
survival
the
outer
orbits
of
the
gas
giants
had
been
passed
at
last
and
the
nipe
fell
on
through
the
asteroid
belt
without
approaching
any
of
the
larger
pieces
of
that
he
and
his
brother
had
originally
elected
to
come
into
this
system
along
its
orbital
plane
had
been
a
mixed
blessing
to
have
come
in
at
a
different
angle
would
have
avoided
all
the
debris
from
planetary
size
on
down
that
is
thickest
in
a
equatorial
plane
but
it
would
also
have
meant
a
greater
chance
of
missing
a
suitable
planet
unless
too
much
reliance
were
placed
on
the
already
weakened
power
generators
as
it
was
the
nipe
had
been
fortunate
in
being
able
to
use
the
gravitational
field
of
the
gas
giant
to
swing
his
ship
toward
the
precise
spot
where
the
third
planet
would
be
when
the
ship
arrived
in
the
third
orbit
moreover
the
planet
would
be
retreating
from
the
nipe
line
of
flight
which
would
make
the
velocity
difference
that
much
the
less
for
a
while
the
nipe
had
toyed
with
the
idea
of
using
the
mining
bases
that
the
local
had
set
up
in
the
asteroid
belt
as
bases
for
his
own
operations
but
he
had
decided
against
it
movement
would
be
much
freer
and
more
productive
on
a
planet
than
it
would
be
in
the
belt
he
would
have
preferred
using
the
fourth
planet
for
his
base
although
much
smaller
it
had
the
same
reddish
arid
look
as
his
own
home
planet
while
the
third
planet
was
three
quarters
drowned
in
water
but
there
were
two
factors
that
weighed
so
heavily
against
that
choice
that
they
rendered
it
impossible
in
the
first
place
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
local
inhabitants
commerce
was
between
the
asteroids
and
the
third
planet
second
and
even
more
important
the
fourth
world
was
at
such
a
point
in
its
orbit
that
the
energy
required
to
land
would
destroy
the
ship
beyond
any
doubt
it
would
have
to
be
the
third
world
as
the
ship
fell
inward
the
nipe
watched
his
pitifully
inadequate
instruments
doing
his
best
to
keep
tabs
on
every
one
of
the
ships
that
the
local
used
to
move
through
space
he
did
not
want
to
be
spotted
now
and
even
though
the
odds
were
against
these
beings
having
any
instrument
highly
developed
enough
to
spot
his
own
craft
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
observed
optically
so
he
squatted
there
in
his
ship
a
thing
about
five
feet
in
length
and
a
little
less
than
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
with
eight
articulated
limbs
spaced
in
pairs
along
his
body
each
limb
ending
in
a
manipulatory
organ
that
could
be
used
equally
well
as
hand
or
foot
his
head
which
was
long
and
snouted
displayed
two
pairs
of
violet
eyes
that
kept
a
constant
watch
on
the
indicators
and
screens
of
the
few
instruments
that
were
still
functioning
aboard
the
ship
and
he
waited
as
the
ship
fell
toward
its
rendezvous
with
the
third
planet
wang
kulichenko
pulled
the
collar
of
his
uniform
coat
up
closer
around
his
ears
and
pulled
the
helmet
and
down
a
bit
it
was
only
early
october
but
here
in
the
tundra
country
the
wind
had
a
tendency
to
be
chill
and
biting
in
the
morning
even
at
this
time
of
year
within
a
week
or
so
he
have
to
start
using
the
power
pack
on
his
horse
to
electrically
warm
his
protective
clothing
and
the
horse
wrappings
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
that
yet
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
always
did
when
he
thought
of
his
grandfather
remarks
about
such
nonsense
your
ancestors
son
of
my
son
he
would
say
conquered
the
tundra
and
lived
upon
it
for
thousands
of
years
without
the
need
of
such
womanish
things
are
there
no
men
any
more
are
there
none
who
can
face
nature
alone
and
unafraid
without
the
aid
of
artifices
that
bring
softness
but
wang
kulichenko
noticed
though
out
of
politeness
he
never
pointed
it
out
that
the
old
man
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
electric
warmth
of
the
house
when
the
short
days
came
and
the
snow
blew
across
the
country
like
fine
white
sand
and
grandfather
never
complained
about
the
lights
or
the
television
or
the
hot
water
except
to
grumble
occasionally
that
they
were
old
and
out
of
date
and
that
the
catalog
showed
that
much
better
models
were
available
in
vladivostok
and
wang
would
remind
the
old
man
very
gently
that
a
ranger
only
made
so
much
money
and
that
there
would
have
to
be
more
saving
before
such
things
could
be
bought
he
did
not
remind
the
old
man
that
he
wang
was
stretching
a
point
to
keep
his
grandfather
on
the
payroll
as
an
assistant
wang
kulichenko
patted
his
horse
rump
and
urged
her
softly
to
step
up
her
pace
just
a
bit
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
territory
to
cover
and
although
he
wanted
to
be
careful
in
his
checking
he
also
wanted
to
get
home
early
around
him
the
forest
of
spread
knotty
alien
branches
trying
to
catch
the
rays
of
the
sun
whenever
wang
thought
of
his
grandfather
remarks
about
his
ancestors
he
always
wondered
as
a
corollary
what
those
same
ancestors
would
have
thought
about
a
forest
growing
up
here
where
no
forest
like
this
one
had
ever
grown
before
they
were
called
because
the
bulk
of
their
pulp
was
used
to
make
paper
they
were
of
no
use
whatever
as
lumber
but
they
really
trees
and
the
organic
chemicals
that
were
leached
from
them
during
the
pulping
process
were
of
far
more
value
than
the
paper
pulp
they
were
mutations
of
a
smaller
plant
that
had
been
found
in
the
temperate
regions
of
mars
and
purposely
changed
genetically
to
grow
in
the
siberian
tundra
country
where
the
conditions
were
similar
to
but
superior
to
their
natural
habitat
they
looked
as
though
someone
had
managed
to
crossbreed
the
joshua
tree
with
the
cypress
and
then
persuaded
the
result
to
grow
grass
instead
of
leaves
and
the
photosynthesis
of
those
grasslike
blades
depended
on
an
compound
that
was
more
closely
related
to
hemoglobin
than
to
chlorophyll
giving
them
a
rusty
red
color
instead
of
the
normal
green
of
earthly
plants
in
the
distance
wang
heard
the
whining
of
the
wind
increase
and
he
automatically
pulled
his
coat
a
little
tighter
even
though
he
noticed
no
increase
in
the
wind
velocity
around
him
then
as
the
whine
became
louder
he
realized
that
it
was
not
the
wind
he
turned
his
head
toward
the
sound
and
looked
up
for
a
long
minute
he
watched
the
sky
as
the
sound
increased
in
volume
but
he
could
see
nothing
at
first
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
motion
a
dot
that
was
hard
to
distinguish
against
the
gray
sky
what
was
it
an
air
transport
in
trouble
there
were
two
transpolar
routes
that
passed
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
here
but
no
air
transport
he
had
ever
seen
made
a
noise
like
that
normally
they
were
so
high
up
as
to
be
both
invisible
and
inaudible
must
be
trouble
of
some
sort
he
reached
down
to
the
saddle
pack
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
moving
speck
and
took
out
the
radiophone
he
held
it
to
his
ear
and
thumbed
the
call
button
insistently
he
thought
with
growing
irritation
as
the
seconds
passed
up
come
on
old
dozer
rouse
yourself
from
your
dreams
at
the
same
time
he
checked
his
wrist
compass
and
estimated
the
direction
of
flight
of
the
dot
and
its
direction
from
him
he
at
least
be
able
to
give
the
airline
authorities
some
information
if
the
ship
fell
he
wished
there
were
some
way
to
triangulate
its
height
velocity
and
so
on
but
he
had
no
need
for
that
kind
of
thing
so
he
had
the
equipment
yes
yes
came
a
testy
dry
voice
through
the
earphone
quickly
wang
gave
his
grandfather
all
the
information
he
had
on
the
flying
thing
by
now
the
whine
had
become
a
shrill
roar
and
the
thing
in
the
air
had
become
a
fish
shape
i
think
it
coming
down
very
close
to
here
wang
concluded
you
call
the
authorities
and
let
them
know
that
one
of
the
aircraft
is
in
trouble
i
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
here
i
call
you
back
later
as
you
say
the
old
man
said
hurriedly
he
cut
off
wang
was
beginning
to
realize
that
the
thing
was
a
spaceship
not
an
airship
by
this
time
he
could
see
the
thing
more
clearly
he
had
never
actually
seen
a
spacecraft
but
he
seen
enough
of
them
on
television
to
know
what
they
looked
like
this
one
did
look
like
a
standard
type
at
all
and
it
did
behave
like
one
but
it
looked
and
behaved
even
less
like
an
airship
and
wang
knew
enough
to
be
aware
that
he
did
not
necessarily
know
every
type
of
spaceship
ever
built
in
shape
it
resembled
the
old
jobs
that
had
been
used
for
the
first
probings
into
space
more
than
a
century
before
rather
than
the
fat
ovoids
he
was
used
to
but
there
were
no
signs
of
rocket
exhausts
and
yet
the
ship
was
very
obviously
slowing
so
it
must
have
an
inertia
drive
it
was
coming
in
much
lower
now
on
a
line
north
of
him
headed
almost
due
east
he
urged
the
mare
forward
in
order
to
try
to
keep
up
with
the
craft
although
it
was
obviously
traveling
at
several
hundred
miles
an
hour
hardly
a
horse
pace
still
it
was
slowing
rapidly
very
rapidly
maybe
he
kept
the
mare
moving
the
strange
ship
skimmed
along
the
treetops
in
the
distance
and
disappeared
from
sight
then
there
was
a
thunderous
crash
a
tearing
of
wood
and
foliage
and
a
grinding
plowing
sound
for
a
few
seconds
afterward
there
was
silence
then
there
came
a
soft
rumble
as
of
water
beginning
to
boil
in
some
huge
but
distant
samovar
it
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
there
was
a
bluish
fluctuating
glow
on
the
horizon
wang
wondered
surely
not
an
ship
without
safety
cutoffs
in
this
day
and
age
still
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
the
cutoffs
had
failed
he
pulled
out
his
radiophone
and
thumbed
the
call
button
again
this
time
there
was
no
delay
yes
how
are
the
radiation
detectors
behaving
there
grandfather
one
moment
i
shall
see
there
was
a
silence
then
no
unusual
activity
young
wang
why
wang
told
him
then
he
asked
did
you
get
hold
of
the
air
transport
authorities
yes
they
have
no
missing
aircraft
but
they
checking
with
the
space
fields
the
way
you
describe
it
the
thing
must
be
a
spaceship
of
some
kind
i
think
so
too
i
wish
i
had
a
radiation
detector
here
though
like
to
know
whether
that
thing
is
hot
or
not
it
only
a
couple
of
miles
away
maybe
a
little
more
and
if
that
blue
glow
is
ionization
caused
by
radiation
it
much
too
close
for
comfort
i
think
any
source
that
strong
would
register
on
our
detectors
here
young
wang
said
the
old
man
in
his
dry
voice
however
i
agree
that
it
might
not
be
the
pinnacle
of
wisdom
to
approach
the
source
too
closely
clear
your
mind
of
worry
grandfather
wang
said
i
accept
your
words
of
wisdom
and
will
go
no
nearer
meanwhile
you
had
best
put
in
a
call
to
central
headquarters
fire
control
there
going
to
be
a
blaze
if
any
judge
unless
they
get
here
fast
with
plenty
of
fire
equipment
i
see
to
it
said
his
grandfather
cutting
off
the
bluish
glow
in
the
sky
had
quite
died
away
by
now
and
the
distant
rumbling
was
fading
too
and
oddly
enough
there
was
not
much
smoke
in
the
distance
there
was
a
small
cloud
of
gray
vapor
that
rose
from
where
the
glow
had
been
but
even
that
was
dissipated
fairly
rapidly
in
the
chill
breeze
quite
obviously
there
would
be
no
fire
after
several
more
minutes
of
watching
he
was
sure
of
it
there
could
have
been
much
heat
produced
in
the
explosion
if
it
could
really
be
called
an
explosion
then
wang
saw
something
moving
in
the
trees
between
himself
and
the
spot
where
the
ship
had
come
down
he
could
see
quite
what
it
was
there
in
the
dimness
under
the
hanging
grasslike
red
strands
from
the
trees
but
it
looked
like
someone
crawling
halloo
there
he
called
out
are
you
hurt
there
was
no
answer
perhaps
whoever
it
was
did
not
understand
russian
wang
command
of
english
was
too
good
but
he
called
out
in
that
language
still
there
was
no
answer
whoever
it
was
had
crawled
out
of
sight
then
he
realized
it
could
be
anyone
crawling
no
one
could
even
have
run
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
ship
in
the
time
since
it
had
hit
much
less
crawled
he
frowned
a
wolf
then
possibly
they
were
too
common
but
there
were
still
some
of
them
around
he
unholstered
the
heavy
pistol
at
his
side
and
as
he
slid
the
barrel
free
he
became
the
first
human
being
ever
to
see
the
nipe
for
an
instant
as
the
nipe
came
out
from
behind
a
tree
fifteen
feet
away
wang
kulichenko
froze
as
he
saw
those
four
baleful
violet
eyes
glaring
at
him
from
the
snouted
head
then
he
jerked
up
his
pistol
to
fire
he
was
much
too
late
his
reflexes
were
too
slow
by
far
the
nipe
launched
himself
across
the
intervening
space
in
a
blur
of
speed
that
would
have
made
a
leopard
seem
slow
two
of
the
alien
hands
slapped
aside
the
weapon
with
a
violence
that
broke
the
man
wrist
while
other
hands
slammed
at
the
human
skull
wang
kulichenko
hardly
had
time
to
be
surprised
before
he
died
the
nipe
stood
quietly
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
thing
he
had
killed
his
stomachs
churned
with
disgust
he
ignored
the
fading
hoofbeats
of
the
from
which
he
had
knocked
the
thing
that
lay
on
the
ground
with
a
crushed
skull
the
was
unintelligent
and
unimportant
this
was
had
been
the
intelligent
one
but
so
slow
so
incredibly
slow
and
so
weak
and
soft
it
seemed
impossible
that
such
a
poorly
equipped
beast
could
have
survived
long
enough
on
any
world
to
become
the
dominant
then
again
perhaps
it
was
not
the
dominant
form
perhaps
it
was
merely
a
higher
form
of
he
would
have
to
do
more
investigating
he
picked
up
the
weapon
the
thing
had
been
carrying
and
examined
it
carefully
the
mechanism
was
unfamiliar
but
a
glance
at
the
muzzle
told
him
it
was
a
projectile
weapon
of
some
sort
the
spiraling
grooves
in
the
barrel
were
obviously
intended
to
impart
a
spin
to
the
projectile
to
give
it
gyroscopic
stability
while
in
flight
he
tossed
the
weapon
aside
now
there
was
a
certain
compassion
in
his
thoughts
as
he
looked
again
at
the
dead
thing
it
must
surely
have
thought
it
was
faced
with
a
wild
animal
the
nipe
decided
surely
no
being
would
carry
a
weapon
for
use
against
members
of
its
own
or
another
intelligent
species
he
examined
the
rest
of
the
equipment
on
the
thing
there
was
very
little
further
information
the
fabric
in
which
it
wrapped
itself
was
crude
but
ingeniously
put
together
and
its
presence
indicated
that
the
being
needed
some
sort
of
protection
against
the
temperature
it
appeared
to
have
a
thermal
insulating
quality
evidently
the
creature
was
used
to
a
warmer
climate
that
served
as
additional
information
to
help
substantiate
his
observation
from
space
that
the
areas
farther
south
were
the
ones
containing
the
major
centers
of
population
the
tilt
of
this
planet
on
its
axis
would
tend
to
give
the
weather
a
cyclic
variation
but
it
appeared
that
the
areas
around
the
poles
remained
fairly
cold
even
when
the
incidence
of
radiation
from
the
primary
was
at
maximum
it
would
have
been
good
he
decided
if
he
had
stopped
the
there
had
been
more
equipment
on
the
thing
back
which
would
have
given
him
more
information
upon
which
to
base
a
judgment
as
to
the
level
of
civilization
of
the
dead
being
that
however
was
no
longer
practicable
so
he
dismissed
the
thought
from
his
mind
the
next
question
was
what
should
he
do
with
the
body
should
he
dispose
of
it
properly
as
one
should
with
a
validly
slain
foe
it
did
seem
that
he
could
do
anything
else
and
yet
his
stomachs
wanted
to
rebel
at
the
thought
after
all
it
was
as
if
the
thing
were
really
a
proper
being
it
was
astonishing
to
find
another
intelligent
race
none
had
ever
been
found
before
although
the
existence
of
such
had
been
postulated
there
were
certain
criteria
that
must
be
met
by
any
such
beings
however
it
must
have
manipulatory
organs
such
as
this
being
very
obviously
did
have
organs
very
much
like
his
own
but
there
were
only
two
which
argued
that
the
being
lacked
dexterity
the
organs
for
walking
were
encased
in
protective
clothing
too
stiff
to
allow
them
to
be
used
as
manipulators
he
ripped
off
one
of
the
boots
and
looked
at
the
exposed
foot
the
thumb
was
not
opposed
obviously
such
an
organ
was
not
much
good
for
manipulation
he
pried
open
the
eating
orifice
and
inspected
it
carefully
ah
the
creature
was
omnivorous
judging
by
its
teeth
there
were
both
rending
and
grinding
teeth
that
certainly
argued
for
intelligence
since
it
showed
that
the
being
could
behave
in
a
gentlemanly
fashion
still
it
was
not
conclusive
if
they
intelligent
it
was
most
certainly
necessary
for
him
to
show
that
he
was
also
civilized
and
a
gentleman
on
the
other
hand
the
slowness
and
lack
of
strength
of
this
particular
specimen
argued
that
the
species
was
of
a
lower
order
than
the
nipe
which
made
the
question
even
more
puzzling
in
the
end
the
question
was
rendered
unnecessary
for
the
time
being
since
the
problem
was
taken
out
of
his
hands
a
sound
came
from
the
ground
a
few
yards
away
it
was
an
insistent
buzzing
cautiously
the
nipe
approached
the
thing
it
was
an
instrument
of
some
kind
he
recognized
it
as
the
device
that
he
had
seen
the
dead
being
speak
into
while
he
himself
had
been
watching
from
the
concealment
of
the
undergrowth
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
approach
the
device
was
obviously
a
communicator
of
some
kind
and
someone
at
the
other
end
was
trying
to
make
contact
if
it
were
not
answered
whoever
was
calling
would
certainly
deduce
that
something
had
gone
wrong
at
this
end
and
of
course
there
was
no
way
for
it
to
be
answered
it
would
be
necessary
then
to
leave
the
body
here
for
others
of
its
kind
to
find
doubtless
they
would
dispose
of
it
properly
he
would
have
to
leave
quickly
it
was
necessary
that
he
find
one
of
their
centers
of
production
or
supply
and
he
would
have
to
do
it
alone
with
only
the
equipment
he
had
on
him
the
utter
destruction
of
his
ship
had
left
him
seriously
hampered
he
began
moving
staying
in
the
protection
of
the
trees
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
investigators
would
come
by
air
or
on
the
and
there
was
no
point
in
taking
chances
his
sense
of
ethics
still
bothered
him
it
was
not
at
all
civilized
to
leave
a
body
at
the
mercy
of
lesser
animals
or
monocells
in
that
fashion
what
kind
of
monster
would
they
think
he
was
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
if
they
caught
him
they
might
think
him
a
lower
animal
and
shoot
him
he
would
not
have
put
an
onus
like
that
upon
them
he
moved
on
government
city
was
something
of
a
paradox
it
was
the
largest
capital
city
in
terms
of
population
that
had
ever
been
built
on
earth
and
yet
again
in
terms
of
population
it
was
nowhere
near
as
large
as
tokyo
or
london
the
solution
to
the
paradox
lies
in
discovering
that
the
term
population
is
used
in
two
different
senses
thus
exposing
the
logical
fallacy
of
the
undistributed
middle
if
in
referring
to
london
or
tokyo
the
term
population
is
restricted
to
those
and
only
those
who
are
actively
engaged
in
the
various
phases
of
actual
government
as
it
is
when
referring
to
government
city
the
apparent
paradox
resolves
itself
built
on
the
remains
of
new
york
manhattan
island
which
had
been
destroyed
by
a
sun
bomb
during
the
holocaust
nearly
a
century
before
government
city
occupied
all
but
the
upper
three
miles
of
the
island
and
the
population
consisted
almost
entirely
of
men
and
women
engaged
either
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
business
of
governing
a
planet
there
were
no
shopping
centers
and
no
entertainment
areas
the
small
personal
flyer
almost
the
same
size
as
the
old
automobile
could
because
of
its
inertia
drive
move
with
the
ability
of
a
hummingbird
so
the
rivers
that
cut
the
island
off
from
the
mainland
were
no
barrier
the
shopping
and
entertainment
centers
of
brooklyn
queens
and
jersey
were
only
five
minutes
away
even
through
the
thickest
traffic
it
was
the
personal
flyer
not
the
clumsy
airplane
that
had
really
eliminated
distance
along
with
national
boundaries
the
majority
of
the
government
officers
homes
were
off
the
island
too
but
this
commuting
did
not
cause
any
great
fluctuation
of
the
population
a
city
that
governs
a
planet
must
operate
at
full
capacity
hours
a
day
and
there
was
a
rush
hour
every
three
hours
as
the
staggered
shifts
changed
physically
the
planet
still
revolved
about
the
sun
politically
earth
revolved
around
government
city
in
one
of
the
towering
buildings
a
group
of
men
sat
comfortably
in
a
room
watching
a
screen
that
because
of
the
quality
and
the
color
fidelity
of
the
scene
it
showed
might
have
been
a
window
except
that
the
angle
was
wrong
they
were
looking
down
from
an
apparent
height
of
forty
feet
on
a
clearing
in
a
forest
in
siberia
the
clearing
was
not
a
natural
one
the
trees
had
been
splintered
uprooted
and
pushed
away
from
the
center
of
the
long
elliptical
area
the
center
of
the
area
was
apparently
empty
one
of
the
men
whose
fingers
were
touching
a
control
panel
in
the
arm
of
his
chair
said
that
is
where
the
ship
made
its
crash
landing
as
you
can
see
from
the
relatively
light
damage
it
was
moving
at
no
great
speed
when
it
hit
from
the
little
information
we
have
mostly
from
a
momentary
radar
recording
made
when
the
incoming
vessel
was
picked
up
for
a
few
seconds
by
the
instruments
of
transpolar
airways
when
it
crossed
the
path
of
one
of
their
freight
orbits
it
is
estimated
that
the
craft
was
decelerating
at
between
fifteen
and
seventeen
gravities
the
rate
of
change
of
acceleration
in
centimeters
per
second
cubed
is
unknown
but
obviously
so
small
as
to
be
negligible
this
picture
was
taken
by
the
fire
prevention
flyers
that
came
in
response
to
an
urgent
call
by
the
assistant
of
the
forest
ranger
who
was
in
charge
of
this
section
there
was
no
fire
asked
one
of
the
other
men
looking
closely
at
the
image
none
said
the
speaker
we
ca
yet
say
what
actually
happened
to
the
ship
we
have
only
a
couple
of
hints
one
of
our
weather
observers
orbiting
at
four
hundred
miles
picked
up
a
tremendous
flash
of
hard
ultraviolet
radiation
in
the
area
around
the
three
thousand
ångstrom
band
there
must
have
been
quite
a
bit
of
shorter
wavelength
radiation
but
the
earth
atmosphere
would
filter
most
of
it
out
a
recording
of
the
radiophone
discussion
between
the
ranger
and
his
assistant
is
the
only
other
description
we
have
the
ranger
described
a
bluish
glow
over
the
site
part
of
that
may
have
been
due
to
actual
blue
light
given
off
by
the
well
call
it
that
word
will
do
for
now
but
some
of
the
blue
glow
was
almost
certainly
due
to
ionization
of
the
air
by
the
hard
ultraviolet
look
at
this
next
picture
the
scene
remained
the
same
and
yet
there
was
a
definite
change
this
was
taken
three
days
later
if
you
notice
the
normal
of
the
foliage
has
darkened
to
a
purplish
brown
in
the
area
around
the
crash
site
now
a
martian
even
in
the
mutated
form
is
quite
resistant
to
since
it
evolved
under
the
thin
atmosphere
of
mars
which
gives
much
less
protection
from
ultraviolet
radiation
than
does
nevertheless
those
trees
have
a
bad
case
of
sunburn
and
no
heat
said
a
third
man
wow
oh
there
was
some
heat
but
not
anywhere
near
what
you
expect
the
nearer
trees
were
rather
dry
as
though
they
been
baked
but
only
at
the
surface
and
the
temperature
probably
did
rise
much
above
centigrade
how
about
x
rays
asked
still
another
man
anything
shorter
than
a
hundred
ångstroms
detected
no
if
there
was
any
radiation
that
hard
there
was
no
detector
close
enough
to
measure
it
we
doubt
frankly
whether
there
was
any
the
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
must
have
stunk
up
the
place
pretty
badly
said
one
of
the
men
dryly
it
did
there
were
still
traces
of
ozone
and
various
oxides
of
nitrogen
in
the
air
when
the
fire
prevention
flyers
arrived
the
wind
carried
them
away
from
the
ranger
so
he
did
get
a
whiff
of
them
and
this
this
it
destroyed
the
ship
completely
almost
completely
there
are
some
lumps
of
metal
around
but
we
make
anything
of
them
yet
some
of
them
are
badly
fused
but
that
damage
was
probably
done
before
the
ship
landed
certainly
there
was
not
enough
heat
generated
after
the
crash
to
have
done
that
damage
his
hand
moved
over
the
control
panel
in
the
armrest
of
his
chair
and
the
scene
changed
this
was
taken
from
the
ground
those
lumps
you
see
are
the
pieces
of
metal
i
was
talking
about
notice
the
fine
white
powdery
ash
which
caused
the
white
spot
that
you
could
see
from
the
air
that
is
evidently
all
that
is
left
of
the
hull
and
the
rest
of
the
ship
none
of
it
is
radioactive
random
samplings
from
various
parts
of
the
area
show
that
the
ash
consists
of
magnesium
lithium
and
beryllium
carbonates
you
do
mean
oxides
said
one
of
the
others
no
i
mean
carbonates
and
some
silicate
we
estimate
that
the
remaining
ash
could
not
have
constituted
more
than
ten
percent
of
the
total
mass
of
the
hull
of
the
ship
the
rest
of
it
vaporized
apparently
into
carbon
dioxide
and
water
some
kind
of
plastic
hazarded
one
of
the
men
undoubtedly
if
you
want
to
use
a
catchall
term
like
but
what
kind
of
plastic
goes
to
pieces
like
that
that
rhetorical
question
was
answered
by
a
silence
there
no
doubt
said
one
of
them
after
a
moment
that
circumstantial
evidence
alone
would
link
the
alien
with
the
ship
but
have
you
any
more
conclusive
evidence
the
hand
moved
and
the
scene
changed
again
it
was
not
a
pretty
scene
that
as
you
can
see
is
a
closeup
of
the
late
wang
kulichenko
the
forest
ranger
who
was
the
only
man
ever
to
see
the
alien
ship
before
it
was
destroyed
notice
the
peculiar
bruises
on
the
cheek
and
ear
the
whole
side
of
the
head
the
pattern
is
quite
similar
on
the
other
side
of
the
head
it
looks
umm
rather
like
a
handprint
it
is
kulichenko
was
slapped
on
both
sides
of
his
head
it
crushed
his
skull
there
was
an
intake
of
breath
this
next
picture
the
scene
shows
the
whole
body
if
you
look
closely
you
see
the
same
sort
of
prints
on
the
ground
around
it
all
very
much
like
handprints
and
that
ties
in
very
well
with
the
photographs
of
the
alien
itself
there
no
doubt
about
it
said
one
of
the
others
the
connection
is
definitely
there
the
lecturer
hand
moved
over
the
control
panel
again
and
suddenly
the
screen
was
filled
with
the
image
of
an
horror
with
four
glaring
violet
eyes
in
spite
of
themselves
a
couple
of
the
men
gasped
they
had
seen
photographs
before
but
a
color
projection
is
something
else
again
until
three
weeks
ago
we
knew
of
no
explanation
for
the
peculiar
happenings
in
northern
asia
after
eight
months
of
investigation
we
found
ourselves
up
against
a
blank
wall
nothing
could
account
for
that
peculiar
fire
nor
for
the
queer
circumstances
surrounding
the
death
of
the
forest
ranger
the
investigators
suspected
an
intelligent
alien
but
well
the
notion
simply
seemed
too
fantastic
attempts
to
trail
the
being
by
means
of
those
peculiar
failed
they
ended
at
a
riverbank
and
apparently
never
came
out
again
we
know
now
that
it
swam
downstream
for
over
a
hundred
miles
little
wonder
it
got
away
even
those
investigators
who
suspected
something
pictured
the
being
as
humanoid
or
rather
anthropoid
in
form
the
prints
certainly
suggest
those
of
an
ape
there
appeared
to
be
four
of
them
judging
by
the
prints
although
frequently
there
were
only
three
and
sometimes
only
two
it
all
depended
on
how
many
of
his
he
felt
like
walking
on
and
then
the
whole
herd
of
them
dived
into
a
river
and
never
came
up
again
eh
remarked
one
of
the
listeners
exactly
you
can
see
why
the
investigators
kept
the
whole
thing
quiet
nothing
more
was
seen
heard
or
reported
for
eight
months
then
three
weeks
ago
a
phone
call
was
received
by
the
secretary
of
the
board
of
regents
of
the
khrushchev
memorial
psychiatric
hospital
in
leningrad
an
odd
breathy
voice
speaking
very
bad
russian
offered
a
meeting
it
was
the
alien
he
managed
to
explain
in
spite
of
the
language
handicap
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
mistaken
for
a
wild
animal
as
had
happened
with
the
forest
ranger
the
secretary
rogov
felt
that
the
speaker
was
probably
deranged
but
as
he
said
later
there
was
something
about
that
voice
that
sound
human
he
said
he
would
make
arrangements
and
asked
the
caller
to
contact
him
again
the
next
day
the
alien
agreed
rogov
then
excuse
me
one
of
the
men
interrupted
apologetically
but
did
he
learn
russian
all
by
himself
or
has
it
been
established
that
someone
taught
him
the
language
the
evidence
is
that
he
learned
it
all
by
himself
from
scratch
in
those
eight
months
i
see
excuse
my
interruption
go
on
rogov
was
intrigued
by
the
story
he
had
heard
he
decided
to
check
on
it
he
made
a
few
phone
calls
asking
questions
about
a
mysterious
crash
in
the
paper
forests
and
the
death
of
a
forest
ranger
naturally
those
who
know
were
curious
about
how
rogov
had
learned
so
much
about
the
incident
he
told
them
by
the
time
the
alien
made
his
second
call
a
meeting
had
been
arranged
when
he
showed
up
those
of
the
board
who
were
still
of
the
opinion
that
the
call
had
been
made
by
a
crank
or
a
psychosis
case
changed
their
minds
very
rapidly
i
can
see
why
murmured
someone
the
alien
ability
to
use
russian
is
limited
the
speaker
continued
he
picked
up
vocabulary
and
grammatical
rules
very
rapidly
but
he
seemed
completely
unable
to
use
the
language
beyond
discussion
of
concrete
objects
and
actions
his
mind
is
evidently
too
alien
to
enable
him
to
do
more
than
touch
the
edges
of
human
communication
for
instance
he
called
himself
or
but
we
do
know
whether
that
refers
to
him
as
an
individual
or
as
a
member
of
his
race
since
russian
lacks
both
definite
and
indefinite
articles
it
is
possible
that
he
was
calling
himself
nipe
or
nipe
certainly
that
the
impression
he
gave
in
the
discussions
that
followed
several
peculiarities
were
noticed
as
you
can
read
in
detail
in
the
reports
that
the
board
and
the
government
staff
prepared
for
instance
in
discussing
mathematics
the
nipe
seemed
to
be
completely
at
a
loss
he
apparently
thought
of
mathematics
as
a
language
rather
than
a
one
and
could
not
progress
beyond
simple
diagrams
that
just
one
small
example
just
trying
to
give
you
a
brief
outline
now
you
can
read
the
reports
for
full
information
he
refused
to
allow
any
physical
tests
on
his
body
and
short
of
threatening
him
at
gunpoint
there
was
no
practicable
way
to
force
him
to
accede
to
our
wishes
naturally
threats
were
out
of
the
question
could
x
rays
have
been
taken
surreptitiously
asked
one
of
the
men
it
was
discussed
and
rejected
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
his
tolerance
to
radiation
is
and
we
did
want
to
harm
him
the
same
applies
to
using
any
anesthetic
gas
or
drug
to
render
him
unconscious
there
was
no
way
to
study
his
metabolism
without
his
unless
we
were
willing
to
risk
killing
him
i
see
naturally
we
could
harm
him
exactly
the
nipe
had
to
be
treated
as
an
emissary
from
his
home
world
wherever
that
may
be
he
has
killed
a
man
yes
but
that
has
to
be
allowed
as
justifiable
homicide
in
since
the
forester
had
drawn
a
gun
and
was
ready
to
fire
nobody
can
blame
the
late
wang
kulichenko
for
that
but
nobody
can
blame
the
nipe
either
they
all
looked
for
a
moment
in
silence
at
the
violet
eyes
that
gazed
at
them
from
the
screen
for
nearly
three
weeks
the
speaker
went
on
humans
and
nipe
tried
to
arrive
at
a
meeting
of
minds
and
just
when
it
would
seem
that
such
a
meeting
was
within
grasp
it
would
fade
away
into
mist
it
was
only
three
days
ago
that
the
russian
psychologists
and
psychiatrists
realized
that
the
reason
the
nipe
had
come
to
them
was
because
he
had
thought
that
the
board
of
regents
of
the
hospital
was
the
ruling
body
of
that
territory
someone
chuckled
but
there
was
no
humor
in
it
now
we
come
to
yesterday
morning
said
the
speaker
this
is
the
important
part
at
this
very
moment
because
it
explains
why
i
feel
we
must
immediately
take
steps
to
tell
the
public
what
has
happened
why
i
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
put
a
man
like
colonel
walther
mannheim
in
charge
of
the
nipe
affair
and
keep
him
in
charge
until
the
matter
is
cleared
up
because
the
public
is
going
to
be
scared
witless
if
we
do
something
to
reassure
them
what
happened
yesterday
morning
mr
president
one
of
the
men
asked
the
nipe
got
angry
lost
his
temper
went
mad
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
at
the
morning
meeting
he
simply
became
more
and
more
incomprehensible
the
psychologists
were
trying
to
see
if
the
nipe
had
any
religious
beliefs
and
if
so
what
they
were
one
of
them
a
valichek
was
explaining
the
various
religious
sects
and
rites
here
on
earth
suddenly
with
no
warning
whatever
the
nipe
chopped
at
valichek
throat
with
an
judo
cut
killing
him
he
killed
two
more
men
before
he
leaped
out
of
the
window
and
vanished
no
trace
of
him
was
found
until
late
last
night
he
killed
another
man
in
leningrad
we
have
since
discovered
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
his
personal
flyer
the
nipe
could
be
anywhere
on
earth
by
now
how
was
the
man
killed
president
with
bare
hands
as
the
others
were
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
identification
of
the
body
was
made
difficult
by
the
fact
that
every
shred
of
flesh
had
been
stripped
away
it
had
been
gnawed
literally
to
the
bone
the
big
man
with
the
tiny
child
on
his
shoulder
pushed
through
the
air
curtain
that
kept
the
warm
humid
air
out
of
the
shop
there
he
said
to
the
little
boy
softly
turning
his
head
to
look
up
into
the
round
chubby
smiling
face
there
is
that
nicer
huh
is
that
better
than
that
hot
old
air
outside
said
the
child
with
a
grin
oh
come
on
boy
i
heard
you
manage
bigger
words
than
that
or
is
it
your
brother
he
chuckled
and
headed
toward
the
drug
counter
hey
jim
the
big
man
brought
himself
up
short
and
turned
carefully
so
as
not
to
jiggle
the
baby
on
his
shoulder
when
he
saw
the
shorter
thinner
man
he
grinned
hugely
jinks
by
god
jinks
watch
it
do
shake
the
hand
too
hard
or
i
drop
this
infant
god
damn
man
i
thought
you
were

siberia
i
was
jim
but
a
man

siberia
forever
is
that
minuscule
lump
of
humanity
your
own
yup
yup
so
i
been
led
to
believe
say
hello
to
your
uncle
jinks
young
say
hello
the
child
jammed
the
three
fingers
of
his
left
hand
into
his
mouth
and
refused
to
say
a
word
his
eyes
widened
with
an
unfathomable
well
he
got
your
eyes
said
the
thinner
man
fortunately
going
to
look
like
his
mother
instead
of
being
ugly
he
a
he
he
that
right
mother
looks
father
plumbing
i
got
another
just
like

but
his
mother
taking
the
other
one
to
the
doctor
to
get
rid
of
the
sniffles
do
want
this
one
to
catch
it
twins
naw
said
the
big
man
sarcastically
octuplets
the
government
took
percent
for
taxes
ask
a
silly
question
get
a
silly
answer
the
smaller
man
said
philosophically
yup
so
how
the
great
northern
wasteland
jinks
cold
said
jinks
but
it
not
going
to
be
a
wasteland
much
longer
jim
those
martian
trees
are
going
to
be
a
big
business
in
fifteen
years
there
be
forests
all
over
the
tundra
they
make
a
hell
of
a
fine
income
crop
for
those
people
we
put
in
over
five
thousand
square
miles
in
seedlings
during
the
past
five
years
the
first
ones
will
be
ready
to
harvest
in
ten
years
and
from
then
on
it
will
be
as
regular
as
clockwork
that
great
great
how
long
you
be
in
town
jinks
about
a
week
then
i
got
to
head
back
to
siberia
well
look
could
you
drop
around
some
evening
we
could
kill
off
a
few
bottles
of
beer
after
we
eat

i

half
an
hour
or
so
right
now

me
buy

beer
or
do
you
want
to
take
the
baby
in
no

but
i
got
to
run
i
just
dropped
in
to
get
a
couple
of
things
then
i
have
to
get
on
out
to
the
plant
some
piddling
little
thing
came
up
and
they
want
to
talk
to
me
about
it
he
patted
the
baby
leg
nothing
personal
pal
he
said
in
a
soft
aside
you
taking
the
baby
into
an
atomic
synthesis
plant
jinks
asked
why
not

safe
as
houses

the
holocaust
jitters

friend

in
a
locker

get
his
genes
irradiated
jinks
said
grinning
so
long
i
call
tomorrow
at
twenty
hundred
fine
see
you
then
so
long
the
big
man
adjusted
the
load
on
his
shoulder
and
went
on
toward
the
counter
of
a
second
that
was
all
the
time
bart
stanton
had
from
the
first
moment
his
supersensitive
ears
heard
the
first
faint
whisper
of
metal
against
leather
he
made
good
use
of
the
time
the
noise
had
come
from
behind
and
slightly
to
the
left
of
him
so
he
drew
his
weapon
and
spun
to
the
left
as
he
dropped
to
a
crouch
he
had
turned
almost
completely
around
drawn
his
gun
and
fired
three
shots
before
the
other
man
had
even
leveled
his
own
weapon
the
bullets
from
stanton
gun
made
three
round
spots
on
the
jacket
almost
touching
each
other
and
directly
over
the
heart
the
man
blinked
stupidly
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
spots
my
god
he
said
softly
then
he
returned
his
own
weapon
slowly
to
its
holster
the
big
room
was
noisy
the
three
shots
had
merely
added
to
the
noise
of
the
gunfire
that
rattled
intermittently
around
the
two
men
and
even
that
gunfire
was
only
a
part
of
the
cacophony
the
tortured
molecules
of
the
air
in
the
room
were
so
besieged
by
the
beat
of
drums
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
crackle
of
lightning
the
rumble
of
heavy
machinery
the
squawks
and
shrieks
of
horns
and
whistles
the
rustle
of
autumn
leaves
the
snap
of
popping
popcorn
the
clink
and
jingle
of
falling
coins
and
the
yelps
bellows
howls
roars
snarls
grunts
bleats
moos
purrs
cackles
quacks
chirps
buzzes
and
hisses
of
a
myriad
of
animals
that
each
molecule
would
have
thought
that
it
was
being
shoved
in
a
hundred
thousand
different
directions
at
once
if
it
had
had
a
mind
to
think
with
the
noise
was
deafening
but
it
was
certainly
bart
stanton
had
reholstered
his
own
weapon
and
half
opened
his
lips
to
speak
when
he
heard
another
sound
behind
him
again
he
whirled
his
guns
in
his
hands
both
of
them
this
time
and
his
forefingers
only
fractions
of
a
millimeter
from
the
point
that
would
fire
the
hair
triggers
but
he
did
not
fire
the
second
man
had
merely
shifted
the
weapons
in
his
holsters
and
then
dropped
his
hands
away
the
noise
which
had
been
flooding
the
room
over
the
speaker
system
died
instantly
stanton
shoved
his
guns
back
into
place
and
rose
from
his
crouch
real
cute
he
said
grinning
i
was
expecting
that
one
the
man
he
was
facing
smiled
back
well
bart
perhaps
we
have
proved
our
point
what
do
you
think
colonel
the
last
was
addressed
to
the
third
man
who
was
still
standing
quietly
looking
worried
and
surprised
about
the
three
spots
on
his
jacket
that
had
come
from
the
special
harmless
projectiles
in
stanton
gun
colonel
mannheim
was
four
inches
shorter
than
stanton
and
was
fifteen
years
older
but
in
spite
of
the
differences
he
would
have
laughed
if
anyone
had
told
him
five
minutes
before
that
he
outdraw
a
man
who
was
standing
with
his
back
turned
his
bright
blue
eyes
set
deep
beneath
craggy
brows
in
a
tanned
face
looked
speculatively
at
the
younger
man
incredible
he
said
gently
absolutely
incredible
then
he
looked
at
the
other
man
a
lean
civilian
with
mild
blue
eyes
a
shade
lighter
than
his
own
all
right
farnsworth
i
convinced
you
and
your
staff
have
quite
literally
created
a
superman
anyone
who
can
stand
in
a
room
and
hear
a
man
draw
a
gun
twenty
feet
behind
him
is
incredible
enough
the
fact
that
he
could
and
did
outdraw
and
outshoot
me
after
i
had
started
well
that
almost
beyond
comprehension
he
looked
back
at
bart
stanton
what
your
opinion
do
you
think
you
can
handle
the
nipe
stanton
stanton
paused
imperceptibly
before
answering
while
his
ultrafast
mind
considered
the
problem
before
arriving
at
a
decision
just
how
much
confidence
should
he
show
the
colonel
mannheim
was
a
man
with
tremendous
confidence
in
his
own
abilities
but
who
was
nevertheless
capable
of
recognizing
that
there
were
men
who
were
his
superiors
in
one
field
or
another
if
i
ca
dispose
of
the
nipe
stanton
said
no
one
can
colonel
mannheim
nodded
slowly
i
believe
you
right
he
said
at
last
his
voice
was
firm
with
inner
conviction
he
shot
a
glance
at
farnsworth
how
about
the
second
man
farnsworth
shook
his
head
he
never
make
it
in
another
two
years
we
can
put
him
into
reasonable
shape
again
but
his
nervous
system
just
could
stand
the
gaff
can
we
get
another
man
ready
in
time
hardly
we
ca
just
pick
a
man
up
off
the
street
and
turn
him
into
a
superman
even
if
we
could
find
another
subject
with
bart
genetic
possibilities
it
would
take
more
time
than
we
have
to
spare
no
way
at
all
of
cutting
the
time
down
this
is
magic
colonel
farnsworth
said
you
do
change
a
nobody
into
a
physical
and
mental
giant
by
saying
or
by
teaching
him
how
to
pronounce
properly
i
aware
of
that
said
the
colonel
without
rancor
it
just
that
i
keep
feeling
that
five
years
of
work
on
stanton
should
have
taught
you
enough
to
be
able
to
repeat
the
process
in
less
time
farnsworth
repeated
the
human
beings
are
machines
colonel
they
require
time
to
heal
time
to
learn
time
to
integrate
themselves
remember
that
in
spite
of
our
increased
knowledge
of
anesthesia
antibiotics
viricides
and
obstetrics
it
still
takes
nine
months
to
produce
a
baby
we
in
the
same
position
if
not
more
so
after
all
we
ca
even
allow
for
a
premature
delivery
i
know
said
mannheim
besides
farnsworth
continued
stanton
body
and
nervous
system
are
now
close
to
the
theoretical
limit
for
human
tissue
i
afraid
you
do
realize
what
kind
of
mental
stability
and
organization
are
required
to
handle
the
equipment
he
has
now
i
sure
i
do
colonel
mannheim
agreed
i
doubt
if
anyone
besides
stanton
himself
knows
he
looked
at
bart
stanton
that
it
then
son
you
it
you
the
only
answer
we
found
so
far
and
the
only
answer
visible
in
the
foreseeable
future
to
the
problem
posed
by
the
nipe
the
colonel
face
seemed
to
darken
ten
years
he
said
in
a
low
voice
ten
years
that
inhuman
monster
has
been
loose
on
earth
become
a
legend
he
replaced
satan
the
bogeyman
monster
and
mumbo
jumbo
lord
of
the
congo
in
the
public
mind
read
the
newsfacs
watch
the
newscasts
take
a
look
at
popular
fiction
everywhere
at
once
he
can
do
anything
he
taken
on
the
attributes
of
the
djinn
the
vampire
the
ghoul
the
werewolf
and
every
other
horror
and
hobgoblin
that
the
mind
of
man
has
conjured
up
in
the
past
half
million
years
that
hardly
surprising
colonel
bart
stanton
said
with
a
wry
smile
if
a
human
being
had
gone
on
a
rampage
of
robbery
and
murder
showing
himself
as
callously
indifferent
to
human
life
and
property
as
you
and
i
would
be
to
the
life
and
property
of
a
cockroach
and
if
in
addition
he
proved
impossible
to
catch
such
a
person
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
demon
too
and
if
you
add
to
that
the
fact
that
the
nipe
is
human
that
he
is
as
frightening
in
appearance
as
he
is
in
actions
what
can
you
expect
i
agree
said
farnsworth
look
at
jack
the
ripper
and
consider
how
he
terrorized
london
a
couple
of
centuries
ago
i
know
said
colonel
mannheim
there
have
been
human
criminals
whose
actions
could
be
described
as
but
the
nipe
has
some
touches
that
few
human
criminals
have
thought
of
and
almost
none
would
have
the
capacity
to
execute
if
he
has
time
to
spare
his
victims
become
an
annoying
problem
in
identification
when
they
found
he
leaves
nothing
but
bones
and
by
to
spare
i
mean
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
the
damned
monster
has
a
very
efficient
digestive
tract
if
nothing
else
he
eats
like
a
shrew
and
if
he
does
have
time
he
beats
them
to
death
bart
stanton
said
thoughtfully
colonel
mannheim
frowned
not
exactly
according
to
the
evidence
farnsworth
interrupted
him
colonel
let
go
into
the
lounge
shall
we
aside
from
the
fact
that
standing
around
in
an
empty
chamber
like
this
is
the
most
comfortable
way
to
discuss
the
fate
of
mankind
this
room
is
scheduled
for
other
work
colonel
mannheim
grinned
caught
up
by
the
touch
of
lightness
that
the
biophysicist
had
injected
into
the
conversation
very
well
i
could
do
with
some
coffee
if
you
have
some
all
you
want
said
farnsworth
leading
the
way
toward
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
opening
it
or
if
you
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
power
to
it
thanks
no
said
mannheim
coffee
will
do
fine
how
about
you
stanton
bart
stanton
shook
his
head
i
love
to
have
some
coffee
but
leave
the
alcohol
alone
i
just
have
the
luck
to
be
finishing
a
drink
when
our
friend
the
nipe
popped
in
on
us
and
when
i
do
meet
him
going
to
need
every
microsecond
of
reflex
speed
i
can
scrape
up
they
walked
down
a
warmly
lit
corridor
to
an
elevator
which
whisked
them
up
to
the
main
level
of
the
neurophysical
institute
building
another
corridor
led
them
to
a
room
that
might
have
been
the
common
room
of
one
of
the
more
exclusive
men
clubs
there
were
soft
chairs
and
shelves
of
books
and
reading
tables
and
smoking
stands
all
quietly
luxurious
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
when
the
three
men
entered
we
can
have
some
privacy
here
farnsworth
said
none
of
the
rest
of
the
staff
will
come
in
until
we
through
he
walked
over
to
a
table
where
an
urn
of
coffee
radiated
soft
warmth
cream
and
sugar
over
there
on
the
tray
he
said
as
he
began
to
fill
cups
the
cups
were
filled
and
the
three
men
sat
down
in
a
triangle
of
chairs
before
any
of
them
spoke
again
then
bart
stanton
said
i
made
the
remark
that
if
the
nipe
does
have
time
to
eat
his
victims
he
just
beats
them
to
death
and
you
started
to
say
something
colonel
colonel
mannheim
took
a
sip
from
his
cup
before
he
spoke
yes
i
was
going
to
say
that
according
to
the
evidence
we
have
he
beats
his
victims
to
death
whether
he
manages
to
eat
them
or
not
oh
stanton
looked
thoughtful
oh
he
not
cruel
about
it
the
colonel
said
he
kills
quickly
and
neatly
the
thing
is
that
he
never
under
any
circumstances
uses
any
weapons
except
the
weapons
that
nature
gave
him
hands
or
feet
or
claws
or
teeth
he
never
uses
a
gun
or
a
knife
or
even
a
club
yoritomo
has
some
theories
about
that
which
i
wo
go
into
now
he
tell
you
about
them
pretty
soon
stanton
thought
about
the
japanese
scientist
and
smiled
i
know
yoritomo
has
threatened
to
tell
me
all
kinds
of
theories
and
believe
me
he
will
said
mannheim
with
a
soft
chuckle
he
took
another
sip
of
his
coffee
and
then
looked
up
at
stanton
you
been
through
five
years
of
hell
stanton
in
addition
you
been
pretty
much
isolated
here
farnsworth
here
has
tried
to
keep
you
informed
but
as
i
understand
it
it
has
only
been
during
the
last
few
months
that
you
actually
been
able
to
absorb
and
retain
information
reliably
at
least
that
the
report
i
get
how
do
you
feel
about
it
bart
stanton
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
true
that
he
been
out
of
touch
with
what
had
been
going
on
outside
the
walls
of
the
neurophysical
institute
for
the
past
five
years
in
spite
of
the
reading
he
done
and
the
newscasts
he
watched
and
the
tv
tapes
he
seen
he
still
had
no
real
feeling
for
the
situation
there
had
been
long
hazy
periods
during
that
five
years
he
had
undergone
extensive
glandular
and
neural
operations
of
great
delicacy
many
of
which
had
resulted
in
what
could
have
been
agonizing
pain
without
the
use
of
suppressors
as
a
result
of
those
operations
he
possessed
a
biological
engine
that
for
sheer
driving
power
and
nicety
of
control
surpassed
any
other
known
to
exist
or
to
have
ever
existed
on
earth
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
nipe
but
those
five
years
of
rebuilding
and
retraining
had
left
a
gap
in
his
life
several
of
the
steps
required
to
make
the
conversion
from
man
to
superman
had
resulted
in
temporary
insanity
the
wild
swinging
imbalances
of
glandular
secretions
seeking
a
new
balance
the
erratic
misfirings
of
neurons
as
they
attempted
to
adjust
to
higher
velocities
and
the
sheer
fatigue
engendered
by
cells
that
were
acting
too
rapidly
for
a
lagging
excretory
system
all
had
contributed
to
periods
of
greater
or
lesser
abnormality
that
he
was
sane
now
there
was
no
question
but
there
were
holes
in
his
memory
that
still
had
to
be
filled
he
admitted
as
much
to
colonel
mannheim
i
see
the
colonel
rubbed
one
hand
along
the
angle
of
his
jaw
considering
his
next
words
can
you
give
me
in
your
own
words
a
general
summary
of
the
type
of
thing
the
nipe
has
been
doing
i
think
so
stanton
said
his
verbal
summary
was
succinct
and
accurate
the
loot
that
the
nipe
had
been
stealing
had
at
first
seemed
to
be
a
hodgepodge
of
everything
it
was
unpredictable
money
as
such
he
apparently
had
no
use
for
he
had
taken
gold
silver
and
platinum
but
one
raid
for
each
of
these
elements
had
evidently
been
enough
with
the
exception
of
silver
which
had
required
three
raids
over
a
period
of
four
years
since
then
he
had
touched
silver
again
he
had
yet
tried
for
any
of
the
radioactives
except
radium
taken
a
full
ounce
of
that
in
five
raids
but
had
attempted
to
get
his
hands
on
uranium
thorium
plutonium
or
any
of
the
other
elements
normally
associated
with
atomic
energy
nor
had
he
tried
to
steal
any
of
the
fusion
materials
the
heavy
isotopes
of
hydrogen
or
any
of
the
lithium
isotopes
beryllium
had
been
taken
but
whether
there
was
any
significance
in
the
thefts
or
not
no
one
knew
there
was
a
pattern
in
the
thefts
and
robberies
nonetheless
they
had
begun
small
and
had
increased
scientific
and
technical
instruments
oscilloscopes
generators
radar
equipment
maser
sets
dynostatic
crystals
thermolight
resonators
and
so
on
were
stolen
complete
or
gutted
for
various
parts
after
a
while
he
had
gone
on
to
bigger
things
whole
aircraft
with
their
crews
had
vanished
that
he
had
not
committed
anywhere
near
all
the
crimes
that
had
been
attributed
to
him
was
certain
that
he
committed
a
great
many
of
them
was
equally
certain
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
his
loot
was
being
used
to
make
instruments
and
devices
of
unknown
kinds
he
had
used
several
of
them
on
his
raids
the
one
that
could
apparently
phase
out
any
electromagnetic
frequency
up
to
about
a
hundred
thousand
megacycles
including
power
frequencies
was
considered
a
particularly
cute
item
so
was
the
gadget
that
reduced
the
tensile
strength
of
concrete
to
about
that
of
a
good
grade
of
marshmallow
after
he
had
been
operating
for
a
few
years
there
was
no
installation
on
earth
that
could
be
considered
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
he
struck
when
and
where
he
wanted
and
took
whatever
he
needed
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
guard
against
the
nipe
since
no
one
knew
what
sort
of
loot
might
strike
his
fancy
next
and
there
was
therefore
no
way
of
knowing
where
or
how
he
would
hit
next
nor
could
he
ever
be
found
after
one
of
his
raids
they
were
plotted
and
followed
through
with
diabolical
accuracy
and
thoroughness
he
struck
looted
and
vanished
and
he
was
seen
again
until
his
next
strike
colonel
mannheim
who
had
carefully
puffed
a
cigar
alight
and
smoked
it
thoughtfully
during
stanton
recitation
dropped
the
remains
of
the
cigar
into
an
ash
receptacle
accurate
but
incomplete
he
said
quietly
you
must
have
made
some
guesses
i
like
to
hear
them
stanton
finished
the
last
of
his
coffee
and
glanced
at
farnsworth
the
biophysicist
was
thoughtfully
looking
down
at
his
own
cup
his
expression
unreadable
stanton
thought
looking
for
something
i
let
him
have
both
barrels
and
see
if
i
hit
the
i
thought
about
it
he
admitted
he
got
up
went
over
to
the
coffee
urn
and
refilled
his
cup
i
got
a
pet
theory
of
my
own
it
just
a
notion
really
i
would
dare
reduce
it
to
syllogistic
form
because
it
might
not
hold
much
water
logically
speaking
but
the
evidence
seems
conclusive
enough
to
me
he
walked
back
to
his
seat
colonel
mannheim
was
watching
him
a
look
of
interest
on
his
face
but
he
said
nothing
to
me
stanton
said
it
seems
incredible
that
the
combined
intelligence
and
organizational
ability
of
the
un
government
is
incapable
of
finding
anything
out
about
one
single
alien
no
matter
how
competent
he
may
be
somehow
somewhere
someone
must
have
gotten
a
line
on
the
nipe
he
must
have
a
base
for
his
operations
and
someone
should
have
found
it
by
this
time
i
may
be
faster
and
stronger
and
more
sensitive
than
any
other
living
human
being
but
that
does
mean
i
have
superhuman
powers
or
that
a
magician
and
i
quite
certain
that
you
colonel
do
credit
me
with
such
abilities
you
do
believe
that
i
can
do
in
a
short
time
what
the
combined
forces
of
the
government
could
do
in
ten
certainly
you
would
rely
too
heavily
on
it
and
yet
apparently
you
are
to
me
that
can
only
mean
that
you
have
another
ace
up
your
sleeve
you
we
going
to
get
the
nipe
fairly
quickly
you
either
have
a
sure
way
of
tracing
him
or
you
already
know
where
he
is
which
is
it
colonel
mannheim
sighed
we
know
where
he
is
he
said
we
have
known
for
six
years
the
nipe
prowled
around
the
huge
underground
room
carefully
checking
his
alarms
if
anyone
entered
the
network
of
tunnels
at
any
point
the
instruments
would
register
that
fact
they
had
to
be
adjusted
of
course
for
the
presence
of
the
small
omnivorous
quadrupeds
that
ran
through
the
tunnels
in
such
numbers
but
anything
larger
than
they
would
be
noted
immediately
he
did
not
like
to
leave
this
place
here
over
a
period
of
ten
revolutions
of
this
planet
about
its
primary
he
had
built
himself
a
nest
that
was
almost
comfortable
here
too
were
his
workshops
and
his
storehouses
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
safe
here
screened
and
protected
as
he
was
but
each
time
he
left
or
entered
he
ran
the
chance
of
being
observed
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
thus
far
he
had
been
hampered
by
technical
problems
there
were
things
he
needed
that
he
could
not
make
for
himself
even
his
own
vast
memory
with
its
every
bit
of
information
instantly
available
could
only
contain
what
had
been
acquired
over
a
lifetime
and
even
his
long
life
had
not
been
long
enough
to
acquire
every
bit
of
knowledge
he
needed
his
work
had
been
long
and
tedious
there
were
many
things
that
could
neither
be
made
in
his
workshops
nor
obtained
from
the
natives
things
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
and
which
the
local
species
had
not
yet
evolved
in
their
own
technology
or
more
likely
which
had
not
been
allowed
them
in
such
cases
he
had
had
to
make
do
with
other
lesser
techniques
which
added
to
the
complexity
of
his
job
but
now
another
problem
had
intruded
itself
into
his
schedule
he
had
a
name
colonel
walther
mannheim
the
meaning
of
the
verbal
symbolism
was
unknown
to
him
the
patterns
of
the
symbolism
were
even
more
evasive
than
the
patterns
of
the
language
itself
colonel
seemed
simple
enough
it
indicated
a
certain
sociomilitary
class
that
was
rigidly
defined
in
one
way
and
very
hazy
in
another
but
the
meanings
and
relationships
of
both
walther
and
mannheim
were
beyond
him
what
difference
for
instance
was
there
between
a
walther
and
a
william
did
a
mannheim
outrank
a
mandeville
or
the
other
way
around
what
functions
differentiated
a
john
smith
from
a
peter
taylor
he
knew
what
a
john
was
and
what
a
smith
was
but
john
smith
was
not
apparently
necessarily
associated
with
sanitary
plumbing
the
meaning
of
some
other
names
eluded
him
entirely
but
that
made
little
difference
at
the
moment
the
meaning
of
colonel
walther
mannheim
symbolic
nomenclature
was
secondary
in
comparison
with
his
known
function
that
required
that
the
nipe
must
eventually
find
and
confront
colonel
walther
mannheim
it
meant
time
lost
of
course
it
meant
that
precious
time
which
should
be
given
to
building
his
communicator
must
be
given
over
to
what
was
merely
a
protective
action
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
on
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
the
nipe
to
give
up
for
to
quit
meant
to
die
and
to
die
here
now
was
unthinkable
his
alarms
were
all
functioning
his
defenses
all
set
he
could
now
leave
his
hideaway
knowing
that
if
it
were
broken
into
while
he
was
away
he
would
be
warned
in
time
but
he
had
no
real
fear
of
that
he
had
done
everything
he
could
do
and
no
intelligent
creature
to
the
nipe
way
of
thinking
would
waste
time
worrying
about
a
situation
he
could
not
improve
upon
taking
with
him
the
equipment
he
needed
for
the
job
he
had
to
do
he
entered
the
tunnel
that
ran
southward
from
his
base
of
operations
once
as
he
moved
along
one
of
the
little
quadrupeds
approached
him
its
teeth
bared
with
an
almost
negligent
flip
of
one
powerful
superfast
hand
he
slammed
it
against
a
nearby
wall
it
dropped
and
lay
still
another
of
its
kind
approached
it
cautiously
the
nipe
noticed
the
approach
with
approval
the
quadrupeds
had
no
real
intelligence
but
they
had
the
proper
instincts
at
last
the
nipe
came
to
another
of
the
many
places
where
the
tunnels
met
with
others
of
the
network
he
crossed
through
several
rooms
all
very
large
and
cluttered
with
the
dusty
bones
of
hundreds
of
the
local
intelligent
if
and
he
was
not
sure
in
his
own
mind
of
this
they
could
actually
be
called
intelligent
but
he
moved
carefully
stepping
over
the
human
bones
and
the
empty
staring
skulls
they
had
apparently
been
properly
devoured
although
he
could
not
be
sure
whether
it
had
been
done
by
their
own
kind
or
by
the
little
quadrupeds
nonetheless
he
would
not
willingly
disturb
their
repose
he
went
on
into
the
tunnel
that
led
westward
and
followed
it
as
it
began
to
angle
down
finally
he
came
to
the
water
edge
to
a
human
being
the
cold
expanse
of
water
that
gleamed
like
ink
in
the
light
of
the
nipe
illuminator
would
have
been
a
barricade
as
impenetrable
as
steel
but
to
the
nipe
the
tidal
pool
was
simply
another
of
his
defenses
for
it
concealed
the
only
entrance
he
ever
used
he
went
in
after
adjusting
his
scuba
mask
and
began
swimming
toward
the
opening
that
led
to
the
estuary
of
the
sea
his
eight
strong
limbs
working
in
unison
in
a
way
that
would
have
been
the
envy
of
a
rowing
team
at
the
jagged
hole
in
the
tunnel
wall
the
gap
that
led
into
open
water
he
paused
to
check
his
instruments
only
after
he
was
certain
that
there
were
no
sonar
or
other
detector
radiations
did
he
propel
himself
onward
out
into
the
estuary
itself
an
hour
later
he
was
warily
circling
the
spot
where
his
little
submarine
was
hidden
he
pressed
a
button
on
a
small
device
in
his
hand
and
a
signal
was
sent
to
the
submarine
the
various
devices
within
it
all
responded
properly
nothing
had
been
disturbed
since
the
nipe
had
set
those
devices
weeks
before
this
was
the
touchiest
part
of
any
of
his
expeditions
there
was
always
the
chance
unlikely
as
it
might
be
that
some
one
of
the
bipedal
natives
had
found
his
machine
he
dared
not
use
it
too
close
to
his
base
because
of
the
possibility
of
its
drive
vibrations
being
detected
in
the
narrow
estuary
out
here
in
the
open
sea
there
was
far
less
likelihood
of
that
but
leaving
his
submarine
concealed
out
here
increased
the
danger
he
exposed
himself
to
every
time
he
left
his
hidden
nest
satisfied
that
the
machine
was
just
as
he
had
left
it
he
entered
it
and
started
its
engines
he
moved
slowly
and
cautiously
until
he
was
well
out
to
sea
well
away
from
the
continental
shelf
and
over
the
ocean
deeps
then
and
only
then
did
he
accelerate
to
full
cruising
speed
the
full
moon
was
in
the
west
hiding
behind
an
array
of
low
scudding
clouds
revealing
its
radiance
in
fitful
bursts
of
silvery
splendor
that
died
again
as
another
clotted
cloud
moved
before
the
face
of
the
white
disk
the
shifting
light
shining
through
the
leaves
of
the
palm
trees
on
the
beach
below
made
strange
shadows
on
the
sand
patterns
of
gray
and
black
on
a
background
of
white
moonlit
sand
but
the
strangest
shadow
of
all
was
one
that
did
not
change
as
the
others
did
a
great
shape
that
seemed
to
wash
slowly
ashore
on
the
receding
tide
for
a
short
while
it
remained
at
the
water
edge
apparently
unmoving
in
the
wash
of
the
waves
then
keeping
low
and
balancing
himself
on
his
third
pair
of
limbs
the
nipe
moved
in
across
the
beach
the
specially
constructed
sandals
he
wore
left
behind
them
a
set
of
very
footprints
prints
that
would
remain
unnoticed
among
the
myriad
of
others
that
were
already
on
the
beach
left
there
by
daytime
bathers
it
required
more
time
yet
to
reach
the
city
and
still
more
time
to
find
the
place
he
was
looking
for
it
was
almost
dawn
before
he
managed
to
find
a
storm
sewer
in
which
to
hide
for
the
day
it
was
partly
his
difficulty
in
finding
a
given
spot
in
a
city
almost
any
city
that
had
convinced
the
nipe
that
the
of
the
bipeds
of
this
planet
could
not
really
be
called
true
intelligence
there
was
no
standardized
method
of
orienting
oneself
in
a
city
not
only
were
no
two
cities
alike
in
their
orientation
systems
but
the
same
city
would
often
vary
from
section
to
section
their
systems
meant
almost
nothing
part
of
a
given
might
be
a
number
and
the
rest
of
it
a
name
but
the
meanings
of
the
numbers
and
names
were
never
the
same
it
was
as
though
some
really
intelligent
outside
agency
had
given
them
the
basic
idea
of
a
system
and
they
not
having
the
intelligence
to
use
it
properly
had
simply
jumbled
the
whole
thing
up
that
the
natives
themselves
had
no
real
understanding
of
any
such
system
had
long
been
apparent
to
him
the
dwellers
in
any
one
area
would
naturally
be
familiar
with
it
they
would
know
where
each
place
was
regardless
of
what
meaningless
names
and
numbers
might
be
attached
to
it
but
strangers
to
that
area
would
not
know
and
could
not
know
the
only
thing
they
could
possibly
do
would
be
to
ask
directions
of
a
local
citizen
which
the
nipe
had
learned
was
exactly
what
they
did
unfortunately
it
was
not
that
simple
for
the
nipe
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
walk
up
to
a
native
and
inquire
for
an
address
he
had
to
prowl
unseen
through
the
alleys
and
sewers
of
a
city
picking
up
a
name
here
a
number
there
by
eavesdropping
on
street
conversations
he
had
found
that
every
city
contained
certain
uniformed
individuals
whose
duty
it
was
to
direct
strangers
and
by
focusing
a
directional
microphone
on
such
men
and
listening
it
was
possible
to
glean
little
bits
of
knowledge
that
could
eventually
be
into
a
whole
understanding
of
the
city
layout
it
was
a
process
but
it
was
the
only
way
the
job
could
be
done
reconnaissance
took
a
tremendous
amount
of
time
away
from
his
serious
work
but
that
work
could
not
proceed
without
materials
to
work
with
and
to
get
those
materials
required
reconnaissance
the
dilemma
was
unavoidable
and
being
what
he
was
the
nipe
accepted
the
unavoidable
and
pursued
his
course
with
phlegmatic
equanimity
overhead
the
city
was
beginning
to
waken
the
volume
of
sound
began
to
increase
police
patrolman
john
flanders
relieved
his
fellow
officer
patrolman
fred
pilsudski
at
a
few
minutes
of
eight
in
the
morning
it
was
a
beautiful
day
even
for
miami
in
the
east
the
morning
sun
shone
brightly
through
the
hard
transparent
pressure
glass
that
covered
the
street
making
the
smooth
resilient
surface
of
the
street
itself
glow
with
warm
light
overhead
patrolman
flanders
could
see
the
aircars
in
their
incessant
motion
apparently
random
unless
one
knew
what
the
traffic
pattern
was
and
how
to
look
for
it
it
was
patrolman
immediate
ambition
to
be
promoted
to
traffic
patrol
so
that
he
could
be
in
an
aircar
above
the
city
instead
of
watching
pedestrians
down
here
on
the
streets
morning
fred
he
said
to
his
brother
officer
how
the
night
go
hi
johnny
pretty
good
not
much
excitement
he
looked
at
his
wristwatch
you
a
couple
minutes
early

the
baby
started
singing
for
his
breakfast
at
a
hour
harriet
woke

feed
him

woke

pilsudski

a
point
just
below
his
left
ear

a
beer

he
touched
a
switch
at
his
belt
and
said

voice
in
his
helmet
phones
said
hq

flanders
right

ahead
pilsudski
took
off
the
light
strong
helmet
reached
inside
it
opened
a
small
sliding
panel
and
took
out
an
object
the
size
and
shape
of
an
aspirin
tablet
the
sealed
unit
that
permitted
him
to
understand
the
conversation
over
the
police
wave
band
without
it
the
police
calls
would
have
been
gibberish
flanders
accepted
the
little
gadget
from
the
other
officer
and
inserted
it
in
his
own
helmet
then
he
replaced
the
helmet
on
his
head
area
hq
this
is
flanders
i
am
relieving
pilsudski
hq
said
the
voice
in
his
ears

police
patrolman
john
flanders
badge
number
was
now
officially
on

looked
up
into
the
sky

place
to
be
on
a
day
like
this
fred
traffic
patrol

pilsudski

and
watch
the
traffic

by
it
dull
tellin
you
johnny
i
asked
for
a
transfer
back
to
a
beat
so
i
could
see
some
people
again
maybe
said
flanders
i
still
like
to
try
it
to
their
own
taste
i
guess
mitchell
and
warber
were
in
luck
last
night
though
excitement
he
sounded
as
though
he
meant
the
word
to
be
sarcastic
what
happened
flanders
asked
some
boob
was
having
a
fight
with
his
wife
and
his
air
intake
was
goofing
off
at
the
same
time
so
while
she
yelling
at
him
he
puts
his
aircar
on
hover
he
pointed
upward
right
up
there
in
level
two
he
opens
the
window
of
his
aircar
mind
you
his
air
intake
workin
like
i
said
mitchell
in
car
spots
him
and
heads
for
him
figuring
there
trouble
but
no
trouble
asked
flanders
trouble
enough
the
driver
old
lady
throws
a
wrench
at
him
an
it
goes
out
the
window
he
chuckled
first
i
heard
about
it
was
when
that
damn
wrench
comes
down
and
bounces
off
the
pressure
glass
then
up
to
the
side
of
the
building
there
and
back
to
the
pressure
glass
then
it
slides
off
into
the
rain
gutter
flanders
looked
up
at
the
curve
of
hard
tough
almost
invisible
pressure
glass
that
covered
the
street
with
all
the
cars
overhead
that
we
got
in
this
city
flanders
said
philosophically
something
like
that
bound
to
happen
every
so
often
that
why
that
glass
is
up
there
besides
for
keepin
the
rain
off
your
head
yeah
pilsudski
said
anyway
mitchell
and
warber
got
there
just
as
she
tossed
the
wrench
arrested
both
of
now
was
that
exciting
flanders
grinned
fred
if
the
rest
of
their
tour
of
duty
was
as
dull
as
you
say
it
was
then
i
reckon
that
must
have
been
real
exciting
hah
pilsudski
shrugged
well
i
for
that
beer
see
you
tomorrow
johnny
right
take
care
o
yourself
as
pilsudski
walked
away
flanders
put
his
hands
behind
his
back
grasping
the
left
in
the
right
he
spread
his
feet
slightly
apart
in
that
position
of
the
foot
patrolman
he
surveyed
his
beat
up
and
down
both
sides
of
the
street
everything
looked
perfectly
normal
another
working
day
had
begun
he
had
no
idea
that
he
was
standing
only
a
few
yards
from
the
most
hated
and
feared
killer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
only
clue
that
he
could
possibly
have
had
to
that
killer
presence
was
a
small
ovoid
the
size
and
shape
of
a
match
head
a
dark
dull
gray
in
color
which
protruded
slightly
from
a
sewer
grating
six
feet
away
supported
on
a
stalk
in
one
end
was
a
tiny
dark
opening
and
that
opening
was
pointed
directly
at
officer
flanders
head
when
he
began
walking
slowly
down
the
street
the
little
ovoid
moved
turning
slowly
on
its
stalk
to
keep
that
dark
hole
pointed
steadily
it
was
so
small
that
ovoid
and
so
inconspicuous
that
no
one
even
looking
directly
at
it
would
have
noticed
it
the
nipe
could
see
and
hear
without
being
either
seen
or
heard
himself
all
morning
long
the
tiny
ovoid
remained
in
place
watching
listening
at
a
woman
in
a
dress
walked
up
to
officer
flanders
and
said
pardon
me
officer
could
you
tell
me
where
i
could
find
the
donahue
building
and
while
the
policeman
told
her
the
nipe
listened
carefully
now
he
knew
what
street
he
was
on
and
its
location
in
respect
to
two
other
streets
he
also
had
a
number
he
remembered
them
all
accurately
and
completely
it
was
a
good
beginning
he
decided
it
would
not
be
too
long
before
he
would
have
enough
to
enable
him
to
locate
the
address
he
was
looking
for
after
that
there
would
only
remain
the
job
of
observing
and
making
plans
to
get
what
he
wanted
at
that
address
he
settled
himself
to
wait
for
more
information
he
knew
that
it
would
be
a
long
wait
but
he
was
prepared
for
that
the
woman
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
for
which
the
doctor
was
privately
thankful
at
least
he
thought
to
himself
the
original
shock
has
worn
off
and
there
nothing
we
can
do
she
asked
nothing
there
was
anguish
in
her
voice
i
afraid
not
the
doctor
told
her
gently
not
yet
there
are
research
men
working
on
the
problem
and
one
day
perhaps
then
he
shook
his
head
but
not
yet
he
paused
i
sorry
mrs
stanton
the
woman
sat
there
in
the
comfortable
chair
and
looked
at
the
specialist
diploma
on
the
doctor
wall
and
yet
she
really
see
the
diploma
at
all
she
was
seeing
something
else
a
kind
of
dream
that
had
been
shattered
after
a
moment
she
began
to
speak
her
voice
low
and
gentle
as
though
the
dream
were
still
going
on
and
she
were
half
afraid
she
might
waken
herself
if
she
spoke
too
loudly
jim
and
i
were
so
glad
they
were
twins
identical
twin
boys
he
said
i
remember
he
said
ought
to
call
them
ike
and
mike
and
he
laughed
a
little
when
he
said
it
to
show
he
did
mean
it
the
doctor
said
nothing
waiting
for
her
to
go
on
i
remember
i
was
propped
up
in
the
bed
the
afternoon
after
they
were
born
and
jim
brought
me
a
new
bed
jacket
and
i
said
i
did
need
a
new
one
because
i
be
going
right
home
the
very
next
day
and
he
said
kid
you
do
think
i
buy
a
bed
jacket
just
for
hospital
use
now
do
you
this
is
for
breakfasts
in
bed
too
and
that
when
he
said
he
seen
the
boys
and
said
we
ought
to
name
them
ike
and
mike
the
tears
were
coming
down
stanton
cheeks
heavily
now
and
the
grief
made
her
look
older
than
her
years
but
the
doctor
said
nothing
letting
her
spill
out
her
emotions
in
words
we
talked
about
it
before
you
know
soon
as
the
obstetrician
found
out
that
i
was
going
to
have
twins
and
jim
jim
said
that
we
should
name
them
alike
unless
they
were
identical
twins
or
mirror
twins
if
they
were
fraternal
twins
we
just
name
them
as
if
been
ordinary
brothers
or
sisters
or
whatever
you
know
she
looked
at
the
doctor
her
eyes
pleading
for
understanding
i
know
he
said
and
jim
was
always
kidding
if
they
were
girls
he
said
we
ought
to
call
them
flora
and
dora
or
annie
and
fanny
or
maybe
susie
and
floozie
he
was
always
kidding
about
it
you
know
i
know
said
the
doctor
and
then
and
then
when
they
identical
boys
he
was
very
sensible
about
it
he
was
always
so
sensible
call
them
martin
and
bartholomew
he
said
if
they
want
to
call
themselves
mart
and
bart
they
can
but
they
wo
be
stuck
with
any
rhyming
names
if
they
do
want
them
jim
was
always
very
thoughtful
that
way
doctor
very
thoughtful
she
seemed
suddenly
to
realize
that
she
was
crying
and
took
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
sleeve
to
dab
at
her
eyes
and
face
i
have
to
quit
crying
she
said
trying
to
sound
very
brave
and
very
strong
after
all
it
could
have
been
worse
could
it
i
mean
the
radiation
could
have
killed
my
boy
too
jim
dead
yes
and
got
to
get
used
to
that
but
i
still
have
two
boys
to
take
care
of
and
they
need
me
yes
stanton
they
will
said
the
doctor
they
both
need
you
very
much
and
you
have
to
be
very
gentle
and
very
careful
with
both
of
them
how
how
do
you
mean
that
she
asked
the
doctor
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
chose
his
words
carefully
identical
twins
tend
to
identify
with
each
other
stanton
there
is
a
great
deal
of
empathy
between
people
who
are
not
only
of
the
same
age
but
genetically
identical
if
they
were
both
completely
healthy
there
would
normally
be
very
little
trouble
in
their
education
at
home
or
in
school
any
of
the
standard
texts
on
psychodynamics
in
education
will
show
you
the
pitfalls
to
avoid
when
dealing
with
identical
siblings
but
your
sons
are
no
longer
identical
stanton
one
is
normal
healthy
and
lively
the
other
is
well
as
you
know
he
is
slow
sluggish
and
badly
the
condition
may
improve
with
time
but
until
we
know
more
about
such
damage
than
we
do
now
he
will
remain
an
invalid
he
had
been
watching
her
for
further
signs
of
emotional
upset
but
she
seemed
to
be
listening
calmly
enough
he
went
on
that
the
trouble
with
radiation
damage
stanton
even
when
we
can
save
the
victim
life
we
can
not
always
save
his
health
you
can
see
i
think
what
sort
of
psychic
disturbances
this
might
bring
about
in
such
a
pair
the
ill
boy
tends
to
identify
with
the
well
one
and
oddly
enough
the
reverse
is
also
true
if
they
are
not
properly
handled
during
their
formative
years
stanton
both
can
be
badly
damaged
emotionally
i
i
think
i
understand
doctor
the
young
woman
said
but
what
sort
of
thing
should
i
look
out
for
what
sort
of
things
should
i
avoid
first
off
i
suggest
you
get
a
good
man
in
psychic
development
the
doctor
said
i
myself
would
hesitate
to
prescribe
it
out
of
my
field
but
i
can
say
that
in
general
most
of
your
trouble
will
be
caused
by
a
tendency
for
the
pair
to
swing
into
one
of
two
extremes
at
one
extreme
you
will
have
mutual
antagonism
this
arises
when
the
ill
child
becomes
jealous
of
the
other
health
while
on
the
other
hand
the
healthy
one
becomes
jealous
of
the
extra
consideration
that
is
shown
to
his
crippled
brother
at
the
other
extreme
the
healthy
boy
may
identify
so
closely
with
his
brother
that
he
feels
every
slight
or
hurt
real
or
imagined
which
the
ill
boy
is
subjected
to
he
becomes
extremely
at
the
same
time
the
invalid
brother
may
come
to
depend
completely
on
his
healthy
twin
in
both
these
situations
there
is
a
positive
feedback
that
constantly
worsens
the
condition
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
careful
observation
and
careful
application
of
the
proper
educational
stimuli
to
keep
the
situation
from
developing
toward
either
extreme
you
need
expert
help
if
you
want
both
boys
to
display
the
full
abilities
of
which
they
are
potentially
capable
i
see
the
woman
said
could
you
give
me
the
name
of
a
good
man
doctor
the
doctor
nodded
and
picked
up
a
book
on
his
desk
i
give
you
the
names
of
several
you
can
pick
the
one
you
like
best
the
one
with
whom
you
seem
to
be
most
comfortable
try
several
or
all
of
them
before
you
decide
they
all
good
men
there
are
many
good
women
in
the
field
too
but
in
this
case
i
think
a
man
would
be
best
of
course
if
one
of
them
thinks
a
woman
is
indicated
that
up
to
him
as
i
said
that
is
my
field
he
opened
the
small
book
and
riffled
through
it
to
find
the
names
he
wanted
the
image
of
the
nipe
on
the
glowing
screen
was
clear
and
finely
detailed
it
was
stanton
thought
as
though
one
were
looking
through
a
window
into
the
nipe
nest
itself
only
the
tremendous
depth
of
focus
of
the
lens
that
had
caught
the
picture
gave
the
illusion
a
feeling
of
unreality
everything
background
and
foreground
alike
was
sharply
in
focus
like
some
horrendous
dream
monster
the
nipe
moved
in
slow
motion
giving
stanton
the
eerie
feeling
that
the
alien
was
moving
through
a
thicker
heavier
medium
than
air
in
a
place
where
the
gravity
was
much
less
than
that
of
earth
with
ponderous
deliberation
the
fingers
of
one
of
his
hands
closed
upon
the
handle
of
an
oddly
shaped
tool
and
lifted
it
slowly
from
the
surface
upon
which
he
worked
that
our
camera
said
colonel
mannheim
but
some
of
the
others
can
always
get
details
that
this
one
does
the
trouble
is
that
we
never
really
have
enough
cameras
in
there
not
unless
we
stud
the
walls
ceilings
and
floors
with
them
and
even
then
i
not
so
sure
we
get
everything
it
is
the
same
as
having
a
trained
expert
on
camera
who
is
to
demonstrate
what
he
doing
an
expert
plays
to
the
camera
and
never
obstructs
any
of
his
own
movements
but
the
nipe
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
shook
his
head
sadly
stanton
narrowed
his
eyes
at
the
image
to
his
own
perceptive
processes
the
motion
seemed
intolerably
slow
would
you
mind
speeding
it
up
a
little
he
asked
the
colonel
i
want
to
get
an
idea
of
the
way
he
moves
and
i
ca
really
get
the
feeling
of
it
at
this
speed
certainly
the
colonel
turned
to
the
technician
at
the
controls
speed
the
tape
up
to
normal
if
there
anything
stanton
wants
to
look
at
more
closely
we
can
run
it
through
again
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
colonel
command
the
nipe
seemed
to
shake
himself
a
little
and
go
about
his
business
more
briskly
and
the
air
and
gravity
seemed
to
revert
to
those
of
earth
what
he
doing
stanton
asked
the
nipe
was
performing
some
sort
of
operation
on
an
box
that
sat
on
the
floor
in
front
of
him
the
colonel
pointed
he
got
a
screwdriver
that
he
modified
to
give
it
a
head
with
an
cross
section
and
he
wiggling
it
around
inside
that
hole
in
the
box
but
what
he
doing
is
a
secret
between
god
and
the
nipe
at
this
point
colonel
mannheim
said
glumly
stanton
glanced
away
from
the
screen
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
other
men
who
were
there
some
of
them
were
watching
the
screen
but
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
watching
stanton
although
they
looked
away
as
soon
as
they
saw
his
eyes
on
them
all
that
is
except
george
yoritomo
who
simply
gave
him
a
smile
of
confidence
to
see
what
kind
of
a
bloke
this
touted
superman
stanton
thought
i
ca
say
i
blame
he
brought
his
attention
back
to
the
screen
so
this
was
the
nipe
hideaway
he
wondered
if
it
were
furnished
in
the
fashion
that
a
nipe
living
quarters
would
be
furnished
on
whatever
planet
the
multilegged
horror
had
come
from
probably
it
had
the
same
similarity
as
robinson
crusoe
island
home
had
to
a
english
home
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
at
all
as
such
as
he
was
the
nipe
needed
no
tables
or
workbenches
all
his
work
was
spread
out
on
the
floor
with
a
neatness
and
tidiness
that
would
have
surprised
many
human
technicians
for
the
same
reason
he
needed
no
chairs
and
since
true
sleep
was
a
form
of
metabolic
rest
he
evidently
found
unnecessary
he
needed
no
bed
the
closest
thing
he
did
that
might
be
called
sleep
was
his
habit
of
stopping
whatever
he
was
doing
and
remaining
quiet
for
periods
of
time
that
ranged
from
a
few
minutes
to
a
couple
of
hours
sometimes
his
eyes
remained
opened
during
these
periods
sometimes
they
were
closed
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
he
was
sleeping
or
just
thinking
the
difficulty
was
in
getting
cameras
in
there
in
the
first
place
colonel
mannheim
was
saying
that
why
we
missed
so
much
of
his
early
work
there
look
at
that
his
finger
jabbed
at
the
image
the
attachment
he
making
that
right
now
it
looks
as
though
it
a
meter
of
some
kind
but
we
do
know
whether
it
a
test
instrument
or
an
integral
and
necessary
part
of
the
machine
he
making
the
whole
machine
might
even
be
only
a
test
instrument
for
something
else
he
building
or
perhaps
a
machine
to
make
parts
for
some
other
machine
after
all
he
had
to
start
out
from
the
very
beginning
making
the
tools
to
make
the
tools
to
make
the
tools
you
know
yoritomo
spoke
for
the
first
time
it
not
quite
as
bad
as
all
that
eh
colonel
we
must
remember
that
he
had
our
technology
to
draw
upon
if
he
been
wrecked
on
earth
two
or
three
centuries
ago
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
a
thing
colonel
mannheim
smiled
at
the
tall
lean
man
granted
he
said
agreeably
but
it
quite
obvious
that
there
are
parts
of
our
technology
that
are
just
as
alien
to
him
as
parts
of
his
are
to
us
remember
how
he
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
building
a
pentode
vacuum
tube
for
a
job
that
could
have
been
done
by
transistors
he
already
had
had
a
chance
to
get
and
did
his
knowledge
of
physics
seems
to
be
about
a
century
and
a
half
behind
ours
stanton
listened
yoritomo
was
in
effect
one
of
his
training
instructors
alien
stanton
thought
course
the
mental
whys
wherefores
of
the
nipe
or
how
to
outthink
the
enemy
in
twelve
dozen
easy
lessons
instructor
george
the
smile
on
yoritomo
face
was
beatific
but
he
held
up
a
warning
finger
ah
ah
colonel
we
must
fall
into
a
trap
like
that
so
easily
remember
that
gimmick
he
built
last
year
the
one
that
blinded
those
people
in
baghdad
it
had
five
perfect
emeralds
in
it
connected
in
series
with
silver
wire
eh
that
true
the
colonel
admitted
but
they
were
used
the
way
use
semiconducting
materials
indeed
not
but
the
thing
did
it
he
has
a
knowledge
of
physics
that
we
do
have
and
vice
versa
which
one
would
you
say
was
ahead
of
the
other
stanton
asked
i
do
mean
just
in
physics
but
in
science
as
a
whole
that
a
difficult
question
to
answer
yoritomo
said
thoughtfully
frankly
i
put
my
money
on
his
technology
as
encompassing
more
than
ours
at
least
insofar
as
the
physical
sciences
are
concerned
i
agree
said
colonel
mannheim
he
got
things
in
that
little
nest
of
his
that
he
stopped
and
shook
his
head
slowly
as
though
he
could
find
words
i
will
say
this
yoritomo
continued
whatever
his
great
technological
abilities
our
friend
the
nipe
has
plenty
of
good
solid
guts
and
patience
he
smiled
a
little
and
then
amended
his
statement
from
our
own
point
of
view
stanton
looked
at
him
quizzically
how
do
you
mean
i
was
just
about
to
agree
with
you
until
you
tacked
that
last
phrase
on
what
does
point
of
view
have
to
do
with
it
everything
i
should
say
said
yoritomo
it
all
depends
on
the
equipment
an
individual
has
a
man
for
instance
who
rushes
into
a
building
to
save
a
life
wearing
nothing
but
street
clothes
has
courage
a
man
who
does
the
same
thing
when
he
wearing
a
nullotherm
suit
is
an
unknown
quantity
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
from
that
action
alone
whether
he
has
courage
or
not
stanton
thought
he
saw
what
the
scientist
was
driving
at
but
not
talking
about
technological
equipment
now
he
said
not
at
all
i
talking
about
personal
equipment
he
turned
his
head
slightly
to
look
at
the
colonel
colonel
mannheim
do
you
think
it
would
require
any
personal
courage
on
stanton
part
to
stand
up
against
you
in
a
gunfight
the
colonel
grinned
tightly
i
see
what
you
mean
stanton
grinned
back
rather
wryly
so
do
i
no
it
would
on
the
other
hand
yoritomo
continued
if
you
were
to
challenge
stanton
would
that
show
courage
on
your
part
colonel
not
really
foolhardiness
stupidity
or
insanity
but
not
courage
ah
then
said
yoritomo
with
a
beaming
smile
neither
of
you
can
prove
you
have
guts
enough
to
fight
the
other
can
you
mannheim
smiled
grimly
and
said
nothing
but
stanton
was
thinking
the
whole
thing
out
very
carefully
just
a
second
he
said
that
depends
on
the
circumstances
if
colonel
mannheim
say
knew
that
forcing
me
to
shoot
him
would
save
the
life
of
someone
more
important
than
himself
or
perhaps
the
lives
of
a
great
many
people
what
then
yoritomo
bowed
his
head
in
a
quick
nod
exactly
that
is
what
i
meant
by
viewpoint
whether
the
nipe
has
courage
or
patience
or
any
other
human
feeling
depends
on
two
things
his
own
abilities
and
exactly
how
much
information
he
has
a
man
can
perform
any
action
without
fear
if
he
knows
that
it
will
not
hurt
him
or
if
he
does
know
that
it
stanton
thought
that
over
in
silence
the
image
of
the
nipe
was
no
longer
moving
he
had
settled
down
into
his
sleeping
position
unmoving
although
the
baleful
violet
eyes
were
still
open
cut
that
off
colonel
mannheim
said
to
the
operator
there
not
much
to
learn
from
the
rest
of
that
tape
as
the
image
blanked
out
stanton
said
have
you
actually
managed
to
build
any
of
the
devices
he
constructed
colonel
some
said
colonel
mannheim
we
have
specialists
all
over
the
world
studying
those
tapes
we
have
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
watch
every
step
the
nipe
makes
and
we
know
the
materials
he
been
using
to
work
with
but
even
so
the
scientists
are
baffled
by
many
of
them
can
you
imagine
the
time
james
clerk
maxwell
would
have
had
trying
to
build
a
modern
television
set
from
tapes
like
this
i
can
imagine
stanton
said
you
can
see
then
why
we
depending
on
you
mannheim
said
stanton
merely
nodded
the
knowledge
that
he
was
actually
a
focal
point
in
human
history
that
the
whole
future
of
the
human
race
depended
to
a
tremendous
extent
on
him
was
a
realization
that
weighed
heavily
and
at
the
same
time
was
immensely
bracing
and
now
the
colonel
said
i
turn
you
over
to
yoritomo
be
able
to
give
you
a
great
deal
more
information
than
i
can
the
girl
moved
with
the
peculiar
gliding
walk
so
characteristic
of
a
person
walking
under
conditions
and
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
she
did
it
showed
that
she
was
no
stranger
to
to
the
three
men
from
earth
who
followed
her
a
few
paces
behind
the
seemed
so
low
as
to
be
almost
nonexistent
although
it
was
actually
a
shade
over
one
quarter
of
that
of
earth
the
highest
gravitational
pull
of
any
planetoid
in
the
belt
their
faint
feeling
of
nausea
was
due
simply
to
their
lack
of
experience
with
low
gravity
the
largest
planetoid
in
the
belt
had
a
surface
gravity
that
was
only
one
eighth
of
the
pull
they
were
now
experiencing
and
only
one
of
the
earth
gravity
they
were
used
to
the
planetoid
they
were
on
or
rather
was
known
throughout
the
belt
simply
as
threadneedle
street
and
was
nowhere
near
as
large
as
ceres
what
accounted
for
the
relatively
high
gravity
pull
of
this
tiny
body
was
its
spin
moving
in
its
orbit
out
beyond
the
orbit
of
mars
it
turned
fairly
rapidly
on
its
axis
rapidly
enough
to
overcome
the
feeble
gravitational
field
of
its
mass
it
was
a
solid
roughly
spherical
mass
of
nearly
two
thirds
of
a
mile
in
diameter
and
like
the
other
inhabited
planetoids
of
the
belt
honeycombed
with
corridors
and
rooms
cut
out
of
the
living
metal
itself
but
the
corridors
and
rooms
were
oriented
differently
from
those
of
the
other
planetoids
threadneedle
street
made
one
complete
rotation
about
its
axis
in
something
less
than
a
minute
and
a
half
and
the
resulting
centrifugal
force
reversed
the
normal
up
and
down
so
that
the
center
of
the
planetoid
was
overhead
to
anyone
walking
inside
it
it
was
that
fact
which
added
to
the
queasiness
of
the
three
men
from
earth
who
were
following
the
girl
down
the
corridor
they
knew
that
only
a
few
floors
beneath
them
yawned
the
mighty
nothingness
of
infinite
space
the
girl
totally
unconcerned
with
thoughts
of
that
vast
emptiness
stopped
before
a
door
that
led
off
the
corridor
and
opened
it
martin
she
said
these
are
the
gentlemen
who
have
an
appointment
with
you
gerrol
vandenbosch
mr
nguma
she
called
off
each
name
as
the
man
bearing
it
walked
awkwardly
through
the
door
gentlemen
she
finished
this
is
stanley
martin
then
she
left
discreetly
closing
the
door
the
young
man
behind
the
desk
in
the
office
stood
up
smiling
as
the
three
men
entered
offered
his
hand
to
each
and
shook
hands
warmly
sit
down
gentlemen
he
said
gesturing
toward
three
solidly
built
chairs
that
had
been
anchored
magnetically
to
the
floor
of
the
room
well
he
said
genially
when
the
three
had
seated
themselves
how
was
the
trip
out
he
watched
them
closely
without
appearing
to
do
so
as
they
made
their
polite
responses
to
his
question
he
was
acquainted
with
them
only
through
correspondence
now
was
his
first
chance
to
evaluate
them
in
person
barnabas
nguma
a
very
tall
man
whose
dark
brown
skin
and
eyes
made
a
sharp
contrast
with
the
white
of
the
mass
of
tiny
crisp
curls
on
his
head
smiled
when
he
spoke
but
there
were
lines
of
worry
etched
around
his
eyes
pleasant
enough
martin
i
afraid
that
steady
acceleration
has
left
me
unprepared
for
this
low
gravity
well
said
stefan
vandenbosch
it
really
is
so
bad
once
you
get
used
to
it
as
long
as
it
steady
i
do
mind
it
he
was
a
rather
chubby
man
of
average
height
with
blond
hair
that
was
beginning
to
gray
at
the
temples
and
pale
blue
eyes
that
gave
his
face
an
expression
of
almost
childlike
innocence
arthur
gerrol
the
third
man
was
almost
as
as
vandenbosch
his
thinning
hair
was
light
brown
and
his
eyes
were
a
deep
and
the
lines
in
his
hard
blocky
face
gave
him
a
look
of
grim
determination
i
agree
stefan
it
is
the
low
gravity
it
the
doggone
surges
we
went
from
one
gee
to
zero
when
the
ship
came
in
for
a
landing
at
the
pole
of
threadneedle
street
then
as
we
came
back
down
here
the
gravity
kept
going
up
and
that
what
do
you
call
it
coriolis
force
yeah
that
it
it
made
my
head
feel
as
though
the
whole
room
was
spinning
then
realizing
what
he
said
he
laughed
sharply
the
man
behind
the
desk
laughed
with
him
yes
it
is
a
bit
disconcerting
at
first
but
the
spin
gives
enough
to
make
a
man
feel
comfortable
once
he
used
to
it
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
threadneedle
street
was
picked
as
the
financial
center
of
the
belt
we
have
a
great
many
visitors
from
earth
and
gee
is
a
lot
easier
to
get
used
to
than
a
fiftieth
then
he
looked
quickly
at
the
others
and
said
now
gentlemen
how
can
lloyd
of
london
help
you
he
had
phrased
it
that
way
on
purpose
deliberately
making
it
awkward
for
them
to
bring
up
the
subject
they
had
on
their
minds
it
was
nguma
who
broke
the
short
silence
quite
simply
martin
we
have
come
to
put
our
case
before
you
in
person
it
is
not
lloyd
we
want
it
is
you
you
refer
to
our
correspondence
on
the
nipe
case
mr
nguma
exactly
we
feel
the
man
behind
the
desk
interrupted
him
nguma
do
you
have
any
further
information
he
looked
as
though
such
news
would
be
welcome
but
that
it
would
not
change
his
mind
in
the
least
that
just
it
martin
said
nguma
we
do
know
whether
our
little
bits
and
dribbles
of
information
are
worth
anything
the
man
behind
the
desk
leaned
back
in
his
chair
again
i
see
he
said
softly
well
just
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
mr
nguma
nguma
looked
surprised
why
just
what
i
written
sir
you
are
acknowledged
as
the
greatest
detective
in
the
solar
system
bar
none
we
need
you
martin
needs
you
that
inhuman
monster
has
been
killing
and
robbing
for
ten
years
men
women
and
children
have
been
slaughtered
and
eaten
as
though
they
were
cattle
you
to
help
us
find
that
thing
before
there
could
be
any
answer
arthur
gerrol
leaned
forward
earnestly
and
said
martin
we
do
just
represent
businessmen
who
have
been
robbed
we
also
represent
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
who
have
had
friends
and
relatives
murdered
by
that
horror
little
people
martin
ordinary
people
who
are
helpless
against
the
terror
of
a
superhuman
evil
this
is
just
a
matter
of
money
and
goods
lost
a
matter
of
lost
human
lives
mr
martin
they
not
the
only
ones
who
are
concerned
either
vandenbosch
broke
in
if
that
hellish
thing
is
destroyed
more
will
die
who
knows
how
long
a
beast
like
that
may
live
what
is
its
nobody
knows
he
waved
a
hand
in
the
air
for
all
we
know
it
could
go
on
for
another
century
maybe
more
killing
killing
killing
the
detective
looked
at
them
for
a
moment
in
silence
these
three
men
represented
more
than
just
a
group
of
businessmen
who
had
grown
uneasy
about
the
government
ability
to
catch
the
nipe
they
represented
more
than
a
few
hundred
or
even
a
few
thousand
people
who
had
been
directly
affected
by
the
monster
depredations
they
represented
the
growing
feeling
of
unrest
that
was
making
itself
known
all
over
earth
it
was
even
making
itself
felt
out
here
in
the
belt
although
the
nipe
had
not
in
the
past
decade
shown
any
desire
to
leave
earth
why
had
the
beast
been
found
why
could
it
be
killed
why
were
its
raids
always
so
fantastically
successful
for
every
toothmark
that
inhuman
thing
had
left
on
a
human
bone
it
had
left
a
thousand
on
human
minds
marks
of
a
fear
that
was
more
than
a
fear
it
was
a
terror
of
the
unknown
the
number
of
people
killed
in
ordinary
accidents
in
a
single
week
was
greater
than
the
total
number
killed
by
the
nipe
in
the
last
decade
but
nowhere
were
men
banding
together
to
put
a
stop
to
that
sort
of
death
accidental
death
was
a
known
factor
almost
a
friend
the
nipe
was
stark
horror
the
detective
said
gentlemen
i
sorry
but
what
i
said
in
my
last
letter
still
goes
i
ca
take
the
job
i
will
not
go
to
earth
every
one
of
the
three
men
could
sense
the
determination
in
his
voice
the
utter
finality
of
his
words
there
was
no
mistaking
the
will
of
the
man
they
knew
that
nothing
could
shake
him
nothing
at
least
that
they
could
do
but
they
could
admit
defeat
no
matter
how
futile
they
knew
it
to
be
they
still
had
to
try
nguma
took
a
billfold
from
his
jacket
pocket
opened
it
and
took
out
an
engraved
sheet
of
paper
with
an
embossed
seal
in
one
corner
he
put
it
on
the
desk
in
front
of
the
detective
would
you
look
at
that
mr
martin
he
asked
the
detective
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
the
expression
on
his
face
did
not
change
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
he
said
in
a
voice
that
showed
only
polite
interest
a
cool
quarter
of
a
million
that
a
lot
of
money
mr
nguma
it
is
said
nguma
as
you
can
see
that
sum
has
just
been
deposited
here
in
the
belt
branch
of
the
bank
of
england
it
will
be
transferred
to
your
account
immediately
as
soon
as
you
agree
to
come
to
earth
to
find
and
kill
the
nipe
the
detective
looked
up
from
his
inspection
of
the
certificate
he
had
known
that
the
three
men
had
made
a
visit
to
the
bank
offices
and
he
had
been
fairly
sure
of
their
purpose
when
he
had
received
the
information
he
had
not
known
the
sum
would
be
quite
so
large
a
quarter
of
a
million
just
to
take
the
job
he
asked
and
what
if
i
do
catch
him
we
have
faith
in
you
martin
nguma
said
we
know
your
reputation
we
know
what
you
done
in
the
past
the
government
police
have
been
able
to
do
anything
they
completely
baffled
and
have
been
for
ten
years
they
will
continue
to
be
so
this
alien
mind
is
too
devilishly
sharp
for
the
kind
of
men
in
government
service
we
know
that
when
you
take
this
job
the
finest
brain
in
the
solar
system
will
be
searching
for
that
horror
if
you
ca
find
him
he
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
that
was
partly
a
dismissal
of
all
hope
and
partly
an
appeal
to
the
man
whose
services
he
wanted
so
desperately
the
detective
put
the
certificate
down
on
the
desk
top
and
pushed
it
toward
nguma
that
very
flattering
sir
really
and
i
wish
there
were
some
more
diplomatic
way
of
saying
no
but
that
all
i
can
say
there
will
be
a
like
sum
deposited
to
your
account
as
soon
as
you
either
kill
or
capture
the
nipe
or
discovering
his
hideout
enable
the
government
officials
to
kill
or
capture
him
said
nguma
that
half
a
million
in
all
gerrol
put
in
we
worked
hard
to
raise
that
money
martin
it
should
be
enough
the
detective
kept
his
temper
under
icy
control
allowing
just
enough
of
his
anger
to
show
to
make
his
point
gerrol
it
is
not
a
question
of
money
your
offer
is
more
than
generous
it
our
final
offer
gerrol
said
flatly
i
hope
it
is
gerrol
the
detective
said
coldly
i
sincerely
hope
it
is
for
the
past
six
months
you
and
your
organization
have
been
trying
to
get
me
to
take
this
job
i
appreciate
the
sincerity
of
your
efforts
believe
me
and
as
i
said
i
am
honored
and
flattered
that
you
should
think
so
highly
of
me
on
the
other
hand
your
method
of
going
about
it
is
hardly
flattering
i
turned
down
your
first
offer
of
twenty
thousand
six
months
ago
since
then
you
have
been
going
up
and
up
and
up
until
you
have
finally
reached
times
the
original
amount
you
seem
to
think
i
have
been
holding
out
for
more
money
i
have
attempted
to
disabuse
you
of
that
notion
but
you
would
not
read
what
i
put
down
in
my
communications
evidently
if
i
had
wanted
more
money
than
you
offered
at
first
i
would
have
said
so
i
would
have
quoted
you
a
price
i
did
not
i
gave
you
an
unqualified
refusal
i
give
it
to
you
still
flatly
absolutely
and
finally
nguma
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
who
could
find
his
tongue
immediately
i
should
think
he
said
somewhat
acidly
that
you
would
consider
it
your
duty
to
the
detective
cut
him
off
my
duty
nguma
is
at
this
moment
to
my
employers
i
am
a
paid
investigator
for
lloyd
of
london
belt
branch
i
draw
a
salary
that
is
more
than
adequate
for
my
needs
and
almost
adequate
for
my
taste
in
the
little
luxuries
of
life
i
am
for
the
time
being
at
least
satisfied
with
my
work
so
are
my
employers
until
one
or
the
other
of
us
becomes
dissatisfied
the
situation
will
remain
as
it
is
i
will
not
accept
any
outside
work
of
any
kind
except
at
the
instructions
of
or
with
the
permission
of
my
employers
i
have
neither
i
want
neither
at
this
time
that
is
all
gentlemen
good
day
but
the
money
nguma
said
the
money
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
bank
and
returned
to
earth
i
suggest
you
return
it
to
the
people
who
have
donated
it
to
your
organization
if
that
is
impossible
i
suggest
you
donate
it
to
the
government
officials
who
are
working
so
hard
to
do
the
job
you
want
done
i
assure
you
they
are
much
more
capable
than
i
of
dealing
with
the
nipe
good
day
nguma
vandenbosch
mr
gerrol
they
looked
hurt
bewildered
and
angry
only
barnabas
nguma
looked
as
if
he
might
have
some
slight
understanding
of
what
had
happened
he
was
the
only
one
who
spoke
good
day
martin
i
am
sorry
we
have
disturbed
you
thank
you
for
your
valuable
time
he
said
with
dignity
and
then
the
three
men
walked
out
the
door
closing
it
behind
them
the
detective
sat
behind
his
desk
looking
at
the
door
almost
as
if
he
could
see
the
men
beyond
it
as
they
moved
down
the
corridor
several
minutes
later
when
his
secretary
opened
the
door
again
he
was
still
staring
thoughtfully
at
it
she
thought
he
was
staring
at
her
something
the
matter
mr
martin
she
asked
what
oh
no
no
nothing
helen
nothing
just
did
you
see
our
visitors
out
all
right
she
glided
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
well
none
of
them
fell
and
broke
a
leg
if
that
what
you
mean
but
that
gerrol
looked
as
though
he
might
break
a
blood
vessel
i
take
it
you
turned
them
down
again
yes
for
the
last
time
i
think
it
a
shame
they
had
to
travel
out
here
all
that
distance
to
be
turned
down
they
looked
on
me
as
their
great
white
hope
they
could
really
believe
i
would
turn
them
down
could
let
themselves
believe
it
i
guess
they
scared
helen
bright
green
scared
i
know
but
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
i
have
certain
pretensions
to
being
a
lady
i
would
have
booted
that
gerrol
into
orbit
without
a
spacesuit
oh
he
implied
helen
said
angrily
that
you
were
a
coward
that
you
were
afraid
to
face
the
nipe
the
detective
chuckled
i
hope
you
did
say
anything
i
wanted
to
she
admitted
i
wanted
to
tell
him
that
guns
were
easy
to
buy
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
buy
one
and
go
after
the
nipe
himself
i
would
like
to
have
seen
his
face
if
i
asked
him
how
scared
was
of
the
beast
but
i
did
say
a
word
they
were
talking
to
me
anyway
they
were
talking
to
each
other
i
almost
be
willing
to
bet
that
nguma
disagreed
with
gerrol
nguma
did
think
i
was
a
physical
coward
he
thought
i
was
a
moral
coward
how
you
know
intuition
just
from
the
way
he
talked
and
acted
he
felt
the
failure
more
than
the
others
because
he
felt
that
there
was
no
hope
left
at
all
he
was
quite
certain
that
i
myself
did
not
believe
the
nipe
could
be
caught
by
me
or
anyone
else
he
thinks
that
i
turned
down
the
job
because
i
know
i
fail
and
i
do
want
to
have
a
failure
on
my
record
not
big
a
failure
that
ridiculous
of
course
the
girl
said
angrily
the
detective
noticed
a
faint
note
in
her
voice
thinks
the
same
as
he
thought
she
does
want
to
admit
it
to
he
massaged
his
closed
eyes
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
thought
they
both
aloud
he
said
well
we
had
our
little
diversion
let
get
back
to
work
yes
sir
you
want
the
benchaim
file
again
yes
i
got
to
figure
that
tricky
line
down
to
a
t
or
we
may
never
see
that
boy
again
we
have
much
time
either
two
weeks
at
most
she
went
over
to
the
file
cabinet
and
took
out
several
heavy
folders
imagine
she
said
almost
to
herself
imagine
them
trying
to
get
you
away
from
here
when
you
have
a
kidnap
case
to
solve
they
must
be
out
of
their
minds
was
no
kidnap
case
six
months
the
detective
thought
knows
that
not
the
reason
she
only
trying
to
convince
herself
why
did
i
turn
them
down
his
mind
veered
away
from
the
dangerous
subject
and
for
a
moment
his
mental
processes
refused
to
focus
on
anything
at
all
the
girl
put
the
files
down
on
his
desk
thanks
helen
now
let
see
work
on
he
thought
wo
even
think
about
the
other
at
colonel
walther
mannheim
tapped
with
one
thick
finger
the
map
that
glowed
on
the
wall
before
him
that
his
nest
he
said
firmly
right
there
where
those
tunnels
come
together
bart
stanton
looked
at
the
map
of
manhattan
island
and
at
the
gleaming
colored
traceries
that
threaded
their
various
ways
across
it
just
what
was
the
purpose
of
all
those
tunnels
he
asked
the
majority
of
them
were
for
rail
transportation
said
the
colonel
the
island
was
hit
by
a
sun
bomb
during
the
holocaust
and
was
almost
completely
leveled
and
slagged
down
when
the
city
was
completely
rebuilt
afterwards
there
was
naturally
no
need
for
such
things
so
they
were
simply
all
sealed
off
and
forgotten
he
hiding
directly
under
government
city
stanton
said
incredible
it
used
to
be
one
of
the
largest
seaports
in
the
world
colonel
mannheim
said
and
it
very
probably
still
would
be
if
the
inertia
drive
had
made
air
travel
cheaper
and
easier
than
seagoing
how
did
he
find
out
about
those
tunnels
stanton
asked
the
colonel
pointed
at
the
north
end
of
the
island
after
the
holocaust
the
first
returnees
to
the
island
were
wild
animals
which
crossed
over
from
the
mainland
to
the
north
the
harlem
river
is
very
wide
at
this
point
as
you
can
see
there
was
a
bridge
right
at
about
this
point
here
the
very
tip
of
the
island
it
had
collapsed
into
the
water
but
there
was
enough
of
it
to
allow
animals
to
cross
because
of
the
rocky
hills
at
this
end
of
the
island
there
were
places
which
were
spared
the
direct
effects
of
the
bomb
and
grasses
and
trees
began
growing
there
that
why
it
was
decided
that
section
should
be
left
as
a
game
preserve
when
the
government
built
the
capital
on
the
southern
part
of
the
island
his
finger
moved
down
the
map
the
upper
three
miles
of
the
island
down
to
here
where
it
begins
to
widen
are
all
game
preserve
there
a
high
wall
at
this
point
which
separates
it
from
the
city
which
keeps
the
animals
penned
in
and
the
ruins
of
the
bridges
which
connected
with
the
mainland
have
been
removed
so
animals
ca
get
across
any
more
two
years
after
he
arrived
the
nipe
was
almost
caught
he
had
managed
to
get
here
from
asia
by
stealing
a
flyer
in
leningrad
according
to
yoritomo
and
the
other
psychologists
who
have
been
studying
the
nipe
he
apparently
does
not
believe
that
human
beings
are
anything
more
than
trained
animals
he
was
looking
then
as
he
is
apparently
still
looking
for
the
rulers
of
earth
he
expected
to
find
them
of
course
in
government
city
needless
to
say
said
the
colonel
with
a
touch
of
irony
he
failed
but
he
was
seen
asked
stanton
he
was
seen
and
pursued
but
he
got
away
easily
heading
north
the
whole
island
was
searched
from
the
southern
tip
to
the
wall
and
the
police
were
ready
to
start
an
combing
of
the
game
preserve
by
the
end
of
the
third
day
after
he
was
seen
but
he
hit
and
robbed
a
chemical
supply
house
in
northern
pennsylvania
killing
two
men
so
the
search
was
called
off
it
was
until
two
years
later
after
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
pattern
of
his
raids
had
given
us
enough
material
to
work
with
that
we
determined
that
he
must
have
found
an
opening
into
one
of
the
tunnels
up
here
in
the
game
preserve
he
gestured
again
at
the
map
very
likely
he
immediately
saw
that
no
human
being
had
been
down
there
in
a
long
time
and
that
there
was
much
chance
of
a
man
coming
down
there
in
the
foreseeable
future
it
was
a
perfect
place
for
his
base
how
does
he
move
in
and
out
stanton
asked
this
way
the
colonel
traced
a
finger
down
one
of
the
red
lines
on
the
map
southward
until
he
came
to
a
spot
only
a
little
over
two
miles
from
the
southernmost
tip
of
the
island
the
line
turned
abruptly
toward
the
western
shore
of
the
island
where
it
stopped
there
are
tunnels
that
go
underneath
the
hudson
river
at
this
point
and
emerge
on
the
other
side
over
here
in
new
jersey
the
one
he
uses
is
only
one
of
several
but
it
has
one
distinct
advantage
that
the
others
do
not
all
of
them
are
flooded
now
the
sun
bomb
caved
them
in
when
the
primary
shock
wave
hit
the
surface
of
the
water
the
tunnel
he
uses
has
a
hole
in
it
big
enough
for
him
to
swim
through
in
spite
of
his
high
rate
of
metabolism
the
nipe
can
store
a
tremendous
amount
of
oxygen
in
his
body
and
can
stay
underwater
for
as
long
as
half
an
hour
without
breathing
apparatus
if
he
conserves
his
energy
when
he
wearing
his
scuba
mask
he
practically
a
submarine
the
pressure
does
seem
to
bother
him
much
he
a
tough
cookie
i
remember
that
said
stanton
somberly
i
wo
try
to
race
him
underwater
no
said
colonel
mannheim
no
i
would
do
that
if
i
were
you
they
both
knew
that
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
it
than
that
in
spite
of
the
near
miracle
that
the
staff
of
the
neurophysical
institute
had
wrought
upon
stanton
nerves
and
muscles
and
glands
they
could
only
go
so
far
they
could
only
improve
the
functioning
of
the
equipment
that
stanton
already
had
they
could
not
add
more
his
lungs
could
be
and
had
been
increased
tremendously
in
efficiency
of
operation
but
the
amount
of
air
they
could
actually
hold
could
only
be
increased
slightly
there
was
no
way
to
add
much
extra
volume
to
them
without
doing
so
at
the
expense
of
other
organs
in
a
contest
the
nipe
would
win
easily
since
his
body
had
evolved
organs
for
oxygen
storage
while
the
human
body
had
not
you
can
not
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
if
you
are
limited
to
the
structures
and
compounds
found
in
sows
ears
the
best
you
can
do
is
make
a
finer
stronger
more
sensitive
sow
ear
i
understand
that
the
nipe
has
his
hideout
pretty
well
bugged
with
all
kinds
of
alarms
stanton
said
how
did
you
get
your
own
bugs
in
there
without
setting
off
his
well
at
first
we
did
know
for
sure
what
he
was
up
to
we
even
sure
he
was
actually
down
in
those
tunnels
but
we
suspected
that
if
he
was
he
have
alarms
set
all
over
the
place
perhaps
even
alarms
of
types
we
could
recognize
but
we
had
to
take
that
chance
we
to
watch
him
he
walked
over
to
the
nearby
table
and
opened
a
box
some
twelve
inches
long
and
inches
in
see
this
he
said
as
he
took
a
furry
object
from
the
box
it
looked
like
a
large
rat
dead
stiff
unmoving
our
spy
said
colonel
mannheim
the
rat
moved
along
the
rusted
steel
rail
that
ran
the
length
of
the
huge
tunnel
to
a
human
being
the
tunnel
would
have
seemed
to
be
in
utter
darkness
but
the
little
eyes
of
the
rat
saw
the
surroundings
as
faintly
luminescent
glowing
from
the
radiations
given
out
by
the
internal
warmth
of
the
cement
and
steel
the
main
source
of
the
radiations
was
from
above
where
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
warmth
from
the
energy
sources
in
the
buildings
on
the
surface
seeped
through
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
but
here
and
there
were
even
brighter
spots
of
warmth
spots
that
moved
about
on
glowing
feet
and
sniffed
blindly
at
the
air
with
tiny
glowing
noses
rats
on
and
on
moved
the
rat
its
little
pinkish
feet
pattering
almost
silently
on
the
oxidized
metal
surface
of
the
rails
its
sensitive
ears
picked
up
the
movements
and
the
squeals
of
other
rats
but
it
paid
them
no
heed
several
times
it
met
other
rats
on
the
rail
but
most
of
them
sensed
the
alienness
of
rat
and
scuttled
out
of
its
way
once
it
met
a
rat
who
did
not
give
way
hungry
perhaps
or
perhaps
merely
yielding
to
the
paranoid
fury
that
was
a
normal
component
of
the
rattish
mind
it
squealed
its
defiance
to
the
rat
that
was
not
a
rat
it
advanced
baring
its
rodent
teeth
in
a
snarl
of
hate
the
rat
that
was
not
a
rat
became
suddenly
motionless
its
sharp
little
nose
pointed
directly
at
the
oncoming
enemy
there
came
a
noise
a
tiny
popping
hiss
like
that
of
a
very
small
drop
of
water
striking
hot
metal
from
the
left
nostril
of
the
a
tiny
glasslike
needle
snapped
out
at
bullet
speed
it
struck
the
advancing
rat
in
the
center
of
the
pink
tongue
that
was
visible
in
the
open
mouth
then
the
scuttled
backward
faster
than
any
real
rat
could
have
moved
for
a
second
the
real
rat
hesitated
and
it
may
be
that
the
realization
penetrated
into
its
dim
brain
that
rats
did
not
fight
this
way
then
as
the
tiny
needle
dissolved
in
its
bloodstream
it
closed
its
eyes
and
collapsed
rolling
limply
off
the
rail
to
the
rotted
wooden
tie
beneath
the
rat
might
come
to
before
it
was
found
and
devoured
by
its
fellows
or
it
might
not
the
moved
on
not
caring
either
way
the
human
intelligence
that
looked
out
from
the
eyes
of
the
was
only
concerned
with
getting
to
the
nipe
that
how
we
found
the
nipe
colonel
mannheim
said
and
that
how
we
keep
tabs
on
him
now
we
have
over
seven
hundred
of
these
robots
hidden
in
strategic
spots
throughout
those
tunnels
now
and
we
can
put
more
in
whenever
we
want
but
it
took
time
to
get
everything
set
up
this
way
now
we
can
follow
the
nipe
wherever
he
goes
so
long
as
he
stays
in
those
tunnels
if
he
went
out
through
the
one
exit
up
in
the
northern
part
of
the
island
we
could
have
him
followed
by
but
he
shrugged
wryly
i
afraid
the
underwater
problem
still
has
us
stumped
we
ca
get
the
carrier
wave
for
the
impulses
to
go
very
far
underwater
how
do
you
get
your
carrier
wave
underground
to
those
tunnels
stanton
asked
and
how
do
you
keep
the
nipe
from
picking
up
the
radiation
the
colonel
grinned
widely
one
of
the
boys
dreamed
up
a
real
cute
gimmick
those
old
steel
rails
themselves
act
as
antennas
for
the
broadcaster
and
the
rat
tail
is
the
pickup
antenna
as
long
as
the
rat
is
crawling
right
on
the
rail
only
a
microscopic
amount
of
power
is
needed
for
control
not
enough
for
the
nipe
to
pick
up
with
his
instruments
each
rat
carries
its
own
battery
for
motive
power
and
there
are
old
copper
power
cables
down
there
that
we
can
send
direct
current
through
to
recharge
the
batteries
and
when
we
need
them
the
copper
cables
can
be
used
as
antennas
it
took
us
quite
a
while
to
work
the
system
out
but
it
running
smoothly
now
stanton
rubbed
his
head
thoughtfully
these
gaps
in
my
memory
he
thought
it
was
sometimes
embarrassing
to
ask
questions
that
any
schoolboy
should
know
the
answers
to
are
there
ways
of
detecting
objects
underwater
he
asked
after
a
moment
yes
said
the
colonel
several
of
them
but
they
all
require
beamed
energy
of
some
kind
to
be
reflected
from
the
object
we
want
to
look
at
and
we
do
dare
use
anything
like
that
he
sat
down
on
one
corner
of
the
table
his
bright
blue
eyes
looking
up
at
stanton
that
been
our
big
problem
all
along
he
said
seriously
we
have
to
keep
the
nipe
from
knowing
he
being
watched
in
the
tunnels
themselves
we
only
used
equipment
that
was
already
there
adding
only
what
we
absolutely
had
to
small
things
a
few
strands
of
wire
a
tiny
relay
things
that
can
be
hidden
in
places
and
can
be
made
to
look
as
though
they
were
a
part
of
the
original
old
equipment
after
all
he
has
his
own
alarm
system
in
that
maze
of
tunnels
and
we
have
deliberately
kept
away
from
his
detecting
devices
he
knows
about
the
rats
and
ignores
them
they
part
of
the
environment
but
we
do
dare
use
anything
that
would
tip
him
off
to
our
knowledge
of
his
whereabouts
one
slip
like
that
and
hundreds
of
human
beings
will
have
died
in
vain
and
if
he
stays
down
there
too
long
stanton
said
levelly
millions
more
may
die
the
colonel
face
was
grim
as
he
looked
directly
into
stanton
eyes
that
why
you
have
to
know
your
job
down
to
the
most
minute
detail
when
the
time
comes
to
act
the
whole
success
of
the
plan
will
depend
on
you
and
you
alone
stanton
eyes
did
avoid
the
colonel
not
he
thought
be
only
one
man
on
a
team
and
you
know
that
colonel
mannheim
but
you
like
to
shove
all
the
responsibility
off
onto
someone
else
someone
stronger
you
finally
met
someone
that
you
consider
your
superior
in
that
way
and
you
want
to
unload
i
wish
i
felt
as
confident
as
you
do
but
i
aloud
he
said
sure
nothing
to
it
all
i
have
to
do
is
take
into
account
everything
that
known
about
the
nipe
and
make
allowances
for
everything
that
not
known
then
he
smiled
not
he
added
that
i
can
think
of
any
other
way
to
go
about
it
frobisher
touched
the
control
button
that
depolarized
the
window
in
the
breakfast
room
letting
the
morning
sun
stream
in
through
the
now
transparent
sheet
of
glass
her
attention
was
caught
by
something
across
the
street
and
she
said
in
a
low
voice
larry
come
here
larry
frobisher
looked
up
from
his
morning
coffee
what
is
it
hon
the
stanton
boys
come
look
frobisher
sighed
who
are
the
stanton
boys
and
why
should
i
come
look
but
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
the
window
see
over
there
on
the
walkway
toward
the
play
area
his
wife
said
i
see
a
boy
pushing
a
wheeled
contraption
and
three
girls
playing
with
a
skip
rope
frobisher
said
or
do
you
mean
that
the
stanford
boys
are
dressed
up
as
girls
she
corrected
him
they
just
moved
into
the
apartment
on
the
first
floor
who
the
three
girls
no
silly
the
two
stanton
boys
and
their
mother
one
of
them
is
in
that
contraption
it
called
a
therapeutic
chair
oh
so
the
poor
kid
been
hurt
what
so
interesting
about
that
aside
from
morbid
curiosity
the
boy
pushing
the
chair
went
around
a
bend
in
the
walkway
out
of
sight
and
frobisher
went
back
to
his
coffee
while
his
wife
spoke
their
names
are
mart
and
bart
she
said
they
twins
i
should
think
frobisher
said
applying
himself
to
his
breakfast
that
the
mother
would
get
a
chair
for
the
boy
instead
of
making
the
other
boy
push
it
the
poor
boy
ca
control
the
chair
dear
said
frobisher
still
looking
out
the
window
after
the
vanished
twins
there
something
wrong
with
his
nervous
system
i
understand
that
he
was
exposed
to
some
kind
of
radiation
when
he
was
only
two
years
old
that
why
the
chair
has
to
have
all
those
funny
instruments
built
into
it
even
his
heartbeat
has
to
be
controlled
electronically
shame
said
frobisher
spearing
a
bit
of
sausage
kind
of
rough
on
both
of
i
guess
how
do
you
mean
dear
well
i
mean
like
well
for
instance
why
are
they
going
over
to
the
play
area
play
games
right
so
the
one
that
well
has
got
to
push
his
brother
over
there
ca
just
get
out
and
go
has
to
take
the
brother
along
too
kind
of
a
burden
see
frobisher
turned
away
from
the
window
why
larry
i
surprised
at
you
really
do
you
think
the
boy
take
care
of
his
brother
oh
now
honey
i
did
mean
that
it
hard
on
of
the
kid
in
the
chair
has
to
sit
there
and
watch
his
brother
play
baseball
or
jai
alai
or
whatever
while
he
ca
do
anything
himself
like
i
say
kind
of
rough
on
both
of
well
yes
i
suppose
it
must
be
want
some
more
coffee
thanks
honey
and
another
slice
of
toast
hunh
like
some
horrendous
watchful
gargoyle
the
nipe
crouched
motionlessly
on
the
shadowed
roof
of
the
low
building
a
short
projection
from
the
intake
was
wide
enough
to
keep
him
from
being
seen
from
the
air
and
the
darkness
of
the
roof
prevented
anyone
on
the
street
from
seeing
the
four
violet
eyes
that
kept
a
careful
account
of
all
that
went
on
in
the
store
across
the
way
from
his
observation
post
the
lights
were
still
on
inside
the
shop
shedding
their
glareless
brightness
through
the
transparent
display
windows
to
fall
upon
the
street
outside
in
large
luminous
pools
the
nipe
knew
exactly
what
each
man
remaining
inside
was
doing
and
approximately
what
each
would
be
doing
for
the
next
few
minutes
and
he
watched
with
the
expectation
that
his
prophecies
would
be
fulfilled
he
had
watched
long
and
made
a
thorough
study
of
this
establishment
and
tonight
he
expected
to
attain
the
goal
for
which
he
had
worked
so
patiently
this
raid
was
important
in
two
ways
there
were
pieces
of
equipment
he
had
to
get
and
they
were
in
that
shop
on
the
other
hand
this
raid
was
and
would
be
basically
a
diversionary
tactic
now
that
he
had
located
his
real
target
it
was
time
to
create
a
diversion
that
would
draw
his
enemy
attention
away
from
his
immediate
surroundings
this
would
be
a
raid
that
colonel
walther
mannheim
could
not
ignore
two
men
came
out
the
front
door
they
spoke
to
someone
still
inside
so
long
see
you
tomorrow
then
they
walked
down
the
street
together
conversing
in
low
tones
the
nipe
waited
not
until
a
fifth
man
stopped
after
he
opened
the
door
and
flipped
a
switch
on
the
inside
did
the
nipe
make
any
motion
then
he
flexed
his
four
pairs
of
limbs
in
anticipation
but
it
was
quite
time
to
act
yet
the
interior
lights
of
the
shop
went
out
then
the
man
carefully
locked
the
front
door
setting
the
alarms
within
the
shop
then
serene
in
the
belief
that
his
establishment
was
thoroughly
protected
from
burglars
he
too
went
down
the
street
the
nipe
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
before
he
left
his
observation
post
all
was
normal
he
decided
the
time
for
action
had
come
the
nipe
moved
cautiously
along
the
alley
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
that
was
his
target
the
night
watchman
had
returned
to
his
cubicle
as
he
always
did
after
his
preliminary
inspection
of
the
building
alarm
system
he
would
not
leave
for
some
time
yet
if
he
followed
his
habits
and
the
nipe
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
carefully
he
approached
the
rear
door
of
the
little
optical
shop
the
two
massive
objects
floating
in
space
looked
very
much
like
deeply
pitted
pieces
of
rock
the
larger
one
roughly
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
its
greatest
dimension
was
actually
that
a
huge
hunk
of
rock
the
smaller
smaller
of
the
two
was
not
what
it
appeared
to
be
it
was
a
phony
anyone
who
had
been
able
to
conduct
a
very
close
personal
inspection
of
it
would
have
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
a
camouflaged
spaceboat
the
camouflaged
spaceboat
was
on
a
course
with
reference
to
the
larger
mass
although
their
relative
velocities
were
not
great
at
precisely
the
right
time
the
smaller
drifted
by
the
larger
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
the
weakness
of
the
gravitational
fields
generated
between
the
two
caused
only
a
slight
change
of
orbit
on
the
part
of
both
bodies
then
they
began
to
separate
but
during
the
few
seconds
of
their
closest
approach
a
third
body
detached
itself
from
the
camouflaged
spaceboat
and
shot
rapidly
across
the
intervening
distance
to
land
on
the
surface
of
the
floating
mountain
the
third
body
was
a
man
in
a
spacesuit
as
soon
as
he
landed
he
sat
down
and
checked
the
instrument
case
he
held
in
his
hands
no
response
thus
far
then
he
had
succeeded
he
had
had
to
pick
his
time
precisely
the
people
who
were
already
on
this
small
planetoid
could
not
use
their
detection
equipment
while
the
planetoid
itself
was
within
detection
range
of
beacon
only
two
hundred
and
eighty
miles
away
not
if
they
wanted
to
keep
from
being
found
radar
pulses
emanating
from
a
presumably
lifeless
planetoid
would
be
a
dead
giveaway
other
than
that
they
were
mathematically
safe
mathematically
safe
they
would
be
if
and
only
if
they
depended
upon
the
laws
of
chance
no
ship
moving
through
the
asteroid
belt
would
dare
to
move
at
any
decent
velocity
without
using
radar
so
the
people
on
this
particular
lump
of
planetary
flotsam
would
be
able
to
spot
a
ship
approach
easily
long
before
their
own
weak
detection
system
would
register
on
the
pickups
of
an
approaching
ship
the
power
and
range
needed
by
a
given
detector
depends
on
the
relative
velocity
the
greater
that
velocity
becomes
the
more
power
the
greater
range
needed
at
one
mile
per
second
a
ship
needs
a
range
of
only
thirty
miles
to
spot
an
obstacle
thirty
seconds
away
at
ten
miles
per
second
it
needs
a
range
of
three
hundred
miles
the
man
who
called
himself
stanley
martin
had
carefully
plotted
the
orbit
of
this
particular
planetoid
and
had
let
his
spaceboat
coast
in
without
using
any
detection
equipment
except
the
visual
it
had
been
necessary
but
very
risky
the
asteroid
belt
that
magnificently
useful
collection
of
stone
and
metal
lumps
revolving
about
the
sun
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
is
somewhat
like
the
if
every
orbit
in
the
belt
were
perfectly
circular
the
analogy
would
be
more
exact
if
they
were
then
every
rock
in
the
belt
would
follow
every
other
in
almost
exactly
the
way
every
horse
follows
every
other
the
gravitational
attraction
between
the
various
bodies
in
the
belt
can
be
neglected
it
is
much
less
on
the
average
than
the
gravitational
pull
between
any
two
horses
on
a
carousel
if
every
orbit
of
those
millions
upon
millions
of
pieces
of
rock
and
metal
were
precisely
circular
then
they
would
constitute
the
grandest
biggest
in
the
universe
but
those
orbits
are
not
circular
and
even
if
they
were
they
would
not
remain
so
long
the
great
mass
of
jupiter
would
soon
pull
them
out
of
such
perfect
orbits
and
force
them
to
travel
about
the
sun
in
elliptical
paths
and
therein
lies
the
trouble
if
their
paths
were
exactly
circular
then
no
two
of
that
vast
number
of
planetoids
would
ever
collide
they
would
march
about
the
sun
in
precise
order
like
the
soldiers
in
a
military
parade
except
that
they
would
retain
their
spacing
much
longer
than
any
group
of
soldiers
could
possibly
manage
to
do
but
the
orbits
are
elliptical
there
is
a
chance
that
any
two
given
bodies
collide
although
the
chance
is
small
the
one
compensation
is
that
if
they
do
collide
they
wo
strike
each
other
very
hard
the
detective
was
not
worried
about
collision
he
was
worried
about
observation
had
the
people
here
seen
his
boat
if
so
had
they
recognized
it
in
spite
of
the
heavy
camouflage
and
even
if
they
only
suspected
what
would
be
their
reaction
he
waited
it
takes
nerve
and
patience
to
wait
for
thirteen
solid
hours
without
making
any
motion
other
than
an
occasional
flexing
of
muscles
but
he
managed
that
long
before
the
instrument
case
that
he
held
waggled
a
meter
needle
at
him
the
one
factor
was
the
low
gravity
the
problem
of
sleeping
on
a
bed
of
nails
is
caused
by
the
likelihood
of
the
sleeper
accidentally
throwing
himself
off
the
bed
the
probability
of
puncture
or
discomfort
from
the
points
is
almost
negligible
when
the
needle
on
the
instrument
panel
flickered
he
got
to
his
feet
and
began
moving
he
was
almost
certain
that
he
had
not
been
detected
walking
was
out
of
the
question
this
was
a
rock
not
a
one
the
group
of
people
that
occupied
it
had
deliberately
chosen
it
that
way
so
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
its
being
picked
out
for
slicing
by
one
of
the
mining
teams
in
the
asteroid
belt
granted
the
chance
of
any
given
metallic
planetoid
being
selected
was
very
small
but
they
had
not
wanted
to
take
even
that
chance
therefore
without
any
magnetic
field
to
hold
him
down
and
with
only
a
very
tiny
gravitic
field
the
detective
had
to
use
different
tactics
it
was
more
like
mountain
climbing
than
anything
else
except
that
there
was
no
danger
of
falling
he
crawled
over
the
surface
in
the
same
way
that
an
alpine
climber
might
crawl
up
the
side
of
a
steep
slope
seeking
handholds
and
toeholds
and
using
them
to
propel
himself
onward
the
only
difference
was
that
he
covered
distance
a
great
deal
more
rapidly
than
a
mountain
climber
could
when
he
reached
the
spot
he
wanted
he
carefully
concealed
himself
beneath
a
craggy
overhang
it
took
a
little
searching
to
find
exactly
the
right
spot
but
when
he
did
he
settled
himself
into
place
in
a
small
pit
and
began
more
elaborate
preparations
required
nearly
ten
minutes
the
first
five
or
six
minutes
were
taken
up
in
relaxing
from
his
exertions
gravity
notwithstanding
he
had
had
to
push
his
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
over
a
considerable
distance
when
he
was
completely
relaxed
and
completely
hypnotized
he
reached
up
and
cut
down
the
valve
that
fed
oxygen
into
his
suit
then
of
his
own
will
he
went
cataleptic
a
single
note
sounded
by
the
instruments
in
the
case
at
his
side
woke
him
instantly
he
came
fully
awake
as
he
had
commanded
himself
to
do
immediately
he
turned
up
his
oxygen
intake
at
the
same
time
glancing
at
the
clock
dial
in
his
helmet
he
smiled
nineteen
days
and
seven
hours
he
had
calculated
it
almost
precisely
he
was
more
than
an
hour
off
which
was
really
pretty
good
all
things
considered
he
consulted
his
instruments
again
the
supply
ship
was
ten
minutes
away
the
smile
stayed
on
his
face
as
he
prepared
for
further
action
the
first
two
minutes
were
conscientiously
spent
in
inhaling
oxygen
even
under
the
best
cataleptic
conditions
the
human
body
tended
to
slow
down
too
much
he
had
to
get
himself
prepared
for
violent
movement
eight
minutes
left
he
climbed
out
of
the
little
grotto
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
moved
toward
the
spot
where
he
knew
the
airlock
to
the
caverns
underneath
the
planetoid
surface
was
hidden
then
again
he
concealed
himself
and
waited
while
he
continued
to
breathe
deeply
of
the
highly
oxygenated
air
in
his
suit
five
minutes
before
the
ship
landed
he
swallowed
eight
ounces
of
the
nutrient
solution
from
the
tank
in
the
back
of
his
helmet
the
solution
of
amino
acids
vitamins
and
honey
sugar
also
contained
a
small
amount
of
stimulant
of
the
dexedrine
type
and
one
percent
ethanol
he
waited
for
another
minute
for
the
solution
to
take
effect
then
he
unholstered
his
gun
the
supply
ship
was
a
big
one
he
had
known
it
would
be
it
was
only
a
little
larger
than
the
one
he
had
used
to
come
out
here
it
dropped
down
to
the
surface
of
the
small
planetoid
only
ten
meters
from
the
hidden
trapdoor
that
led
to
the
airlock
beneath
the
surface
suddenly
he
could
hear
voices
in
the
earphones
of
his
helmet
it
me
fritz
i
got
all
the
supplies
and
a
nice
package
of
good
the
airlock
trapdoor
opened
and
a
spacesuited
figure
came
out
about
the
deal
the
good
said
the
second
suited
figure
as
it
came
from
the
airlock
of
the
grounded
spaceboat
five
the
detective
hidden
behind
the
nearby
crag
of
rock
listened
and
watched
for
a
minute
or
so
while
the
two
men
began
unloading
cases
of
foodstuffs
from
the
spaceboat
then
satisfied
that
it
was
perfectly
safe
he
aimed
his
gun
and
shot
twice
in
rapid
succession
the
range
was
almost
and
there
was
of
course
no
need
to
take
either
gravity
or
air
resistance
into
account
the
pellets
of
the
charge
that
blasted
out
from
the
gun
were
small
and
massive
they
were
oriented
by
the
magnetic
field
along
the
barrel
of
the
weapon
of
the
hundreds
of
charges
fired
only
a
few
penetrated
the
spacesuits
of
the
targets
but
those
few
were
enough
the
powerful
drug
in
the
head
of
each
tiny
crystal
went
directly
into
the
bloodstream
of
each
target
each
man
felt
an
itching
sensation
he
had
less
than
two
seconds
to
think
about
it
before
unconsciousness
overtook
him
and
he
slumped
nervelessly
gun
in
hand
the
detective
ran
across
the
intervening
space
quickly
his
body
only
a
few
degrees
from
the
horizontal
and
his
toes
paddling
rapidly
to
propel
him
over
the
rough
rock
he
braked
himself
to
a
halt
and
slapped
air
patches
over
the
areas
where
his
charges
had
struck
the
men
suits
sealing
the
tiny
air
leaks
and
at
the
same
time
driving
more
of
the
tiny
needles
into
their
skins
they
would
be
out
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
had
yet
fallen
to
the
ground
that
would
take
several
minutes
under
this
low
gravity
he
left
them
to
drop
and
headed
toward
the
open
airlock
this
was
what
he
had
been
waiting
for
all
those
nineteen
days
in
cataleptic
hypnosis
he
could
have
cut
his
way
into
the
hideout
from
the
outside
he
had
had
to
wait
until
it
was
opened
and
that
time
had
come
only
with
the
supply
ship
once
in
the
airlock
he
touched
the
control
stud
that
would
close
the
outer
door
pump
air
into
the
waiting
room
and
open
the
inner
door
here
was
his
greatest
point
of
danger
greater
even
than
the
danger
of
coming
to
the
planetoid
itself
or
the
danger
of
waiting
nineteen
days
in
a
cataleptic
trance
for
the
coming
of
the
supply
ship
if
the
ones
who
remained
within
suspected
anything
anything
at
all
then
his
chances
of
coming
out
of
this
alive
were
practically
nil
but
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
suspect
they
should
think
that
the
man
coming
in
was
one
of
their
own
the
radio
contact
between
the
men
outside
had
been
limited
to
a
few
micromilliwatts
of
power
necessarily
since
radio
waves
of
very
small
wattage
can
be
decoded
at
tremendous
distances
in
open
space
the
men
inside
the
planetoid
certainly
should
not
have
been
able
to
pick
up
any
more
than
the
beginning
of
the
early
conversation
before
it
had
been
cut
completely
off
by
the
intervening
layers
of
solid
rock
the
chamber
he
entered
was
a
airlock
unlike
the
soundless
discharge
of
his
special
gun
in
the
outer
airlessness
the
blast
of
air
that
came
into
the
waiting
chamber
was
like
a
hurricane
in
noise
and
force
the
room
filled
with
air
in
a
very
few
seconds
the
detective
held
on
to
the
handholds
tightly
while
the
brief
but
violent
winds
buffeted
him
he
turned
as
the
inner
door
opened
his
eyes
took
in
the
picture
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
in
an
even
smaller
fraction
his
mind
assimilated
the
picture
the
woman
was
and
muscular
her
mouth
was
wide
and
beneath
a
large
nose
the
man
was
leaner
and
lighter
and
the
woman
said
fritz
what
and
then
he
shot
them
both
with
gun
number
two
no
needle
charges
this
time
such
shots
would
have
blown
them
both
in
two
unprotected
as
they
were
by
spacesuits
the
small
handgun
merely
jangled
their
nerves
with
a
blast
of
accurately
beamed
supersonics
while
they
were
still
twitching
he
went
over
and
jabbed
them
with
a
drug
needle
then
he
went
on
into
the
hideout
he
had
to
knock
out
one
more
man
whom
he
found
asleep
in
a
small
room
off
the
short
corridor
it
took
a
gas
bomb
to
get
the
two
women
who
were
guarding
the
kid
he
made
sure
that
the
benchaim
boy
was
all
right
then
he
went
to
the
little
communications
room
and
called
for
help
louis
had
been
hit
during
the
holocaust
it
still
retained
much
of
the
flavor
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
especially
in
the
residential
districts
the
old
homes
some
of
them
dating
clear
back
to
the
time
of
sam
clemens
and
the
steamboat
still
stood
warm
and
well
preserved
bart
stanton
liked
to
walk
along
those
quiet
streets
of
an
evening
just
to
let
the
placid
peacefulness
seep
into
him
and
knowing
it
was
rather
childish
he
still
enjoyed
the
small
huckleberry
finn
pleasure
of
playing
hooky
from
the
neurophysical
institute
technically
he
supposed
he
was
still
a
patient
there
more
now
that
he
had
completely
accepted
colonel
walther
mannheim
assignment
he
was
presumably
under
military
discipline
he
assumed
that
if
he
had
asked
permission
to
leave
the
institute
grounds
he
would
have
been
given
that
permission
without
question
but
like
playing
hooky
or
stealing
watermelon
it
was
more
fun
if
it
was
done
on
the
sly
the
boy
who
comes
home
feeling
deliciously
wicked
and
delightfully
sinful
after
staying
away
from
school
all
day
can
have
his
whole
day
ruined
completely
by
being
told
that
it
was
a
holiday
and
the
school
had
been
closed
bart
stanton
did
want
to
spoil
his
own
fun
by
asking
for
permission
to
leave
the
grounds
when
it
was
so
easy
for
a
man
with
his
special
abilities
to
get
out
without
asking
besides
there
a
chance
a
small
one
he
thought
that
permission
might
be
refused
for
one
reason
or
another
and
stanton
was
fully
aware
that
he
would
not
disobey
a
direct
request
to
say
nothing
of
a
direct
order
that
he
stay
within
the
walls
of
the
institute
he
did
want
to
run
any
risk
of
losing
his
freedom
small
though
it
was
after
five
years
of
mental
and
physical
hell
he
felt
a
need
to
get
out
into
the
world
of
normal
ordinary
everyday
people
his
legs
moved
smoothly
surely
and
unhurriedly
carrying
him
aimlessly
along
the
resilient
walkway
under
the
warm
glow
of
the
streetlights
the
people
around
him
walked
as
casually
and
with
seemingly
as
little
purpose
as
he
did
there
was
none
of
the
brisk
sense
of
urgency
that
he
felt
inside
the
walls
of
the
institute
but
he
knew
he
could
never
get
away
from
that
sense
of
urgency
completely
even
out
here
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
that
all
he
had
ever
done
all
his
whole
life
was
to
train
himself
for
the
one
single
purpose
of
besting
the
nipe
if
he
was
training
physically
he
was
listening
to
lectures
from
george
yoritomo
or
from
colonel
mannheim
if
he
was
working
his
muscles
he
was
laying
plans
and
considering
possibilities
for
the
one
great
goal
that
seemed
to
be
the
focal
point
of
his
whole
life
what
would
happen
if
he
failed
what
would
happen
if
he
the
great
superman
found
that
the
nipe
had
only
been
working
at
half
his
normal
potential
what
would
happen
if
that
alien
horror
simply
slashed
out
with
one
ultrafast
hand
and
showed
colonel
mannheim
and
all
his
watching
technicians
that
they
had
completely
underestimated
his
alien
ability
what
would
happen
why
bart
stanton
would
die
of
course
just
as
hundreds
of
other
human
beings
had
died
in
the
past
ten
years
stanton
would
become
another
statistic
and
then
mannheim
plan
beta
would
go
into
effect
the
nipe
would
be
killed
eventually
but
what
if
he
stanton
won
then
what
the
people
around
him
were
not
a
part
of
his
world
really
their
thoughts
their
motions
their
reactions
were
slow
and
clumsy
in
comparison
with
his
own
once
the
nipe
had
been
conquered
what
purpose
would
there
be
in
the
life
of
bartholomew
stanton
he
was
surrounded
by
people
but
he
was
not
one
of
them
he
was
immersed
in
a
society
that
was
not
his
own
because
it
was
not
could
not
be
geared
to
his
abilities
and
potentials
but
there
was
no
other
society
to
turn
to
either
he
was
not
a
man
alone
afraid
in
a
world
he
had
never
made
he
was
a
man
who
had
been
made
for
a
world
a
society
that
did
not
exist
women
a
wife
a
family
life
where
with
whom
he
pushed
the
thoughts
from
his
mind
the
questions
unanswered
and
perhaps
unanswerable
in
spite
of
the
apparent
bleakness
of
the
future
he
had
no
desire
to
die
and
there
was
psychologically
the
possibility
that
too
much
brooding
of
that
kind
would
evoke
a
subconscious
reaction
that
could
slow
him
down
or
cause
a
wrong
decision
at
a
vital
moment
a
feeling
of
futility
could
operate
to
bring
on
his
death
in
spite
of
his
conscious
determination
to
win
the
coming
battle
with
the
nipe
the
nipe
was
his
first
duty
when
that
job
was
finished
he
would
consider
the
problem
of
himself
just
because
he
could
not
now
see
the
answer
to
that
problem
did
not
mean
that
no
answer
existed
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
hungry
he
had
been
walking
through
memorial
park
past
the
museum
an
old
worn
edifice
that
was
still
called
the
missouri
pacific
building
there
was
a
small
restaurant
only
a
block
away
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
took
out
the
few
coins
that
were
there
not
much
but
enough
to
buy
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
milk
because
of
the
trust
fund
that
had
been
set
up
when
he
had
started
the
treatment
at
the
neurophysical
institute
he
was
already
well
off
but
he
did
have
much
cash
what
good
was
cash
at
the
institute
where
everything
was
provided
he
stopped
at
a
newsvendor
dropped
in
a
coin
and
waited
for
the
reproducing
mechanism
to
turn
out
a
fresh
paper
then
he
took
the
folded
sheets
and
went
on
to
the
restaurant
he
rarely
read
a
newssheet
mostly
his
information
about
the
world
that
existed
outside
the
walls
of
the
institute
came
from
the
televised
newscasts
but
occasionally
he
liked
to
read
the
small
relatively
unimportant
little
stories
about
people
who
had
done
small
relatively
unimportant
things
stories
that
did
appear
in
the
headlines
or
the
newscasts
the
last
important
news
story
that
he
had
heard
had
come
two
nights
before
the
nipe
had
robbed
an
optical
products
company
in
miami
the
camera
had
shown
the
shop
on
the
screen
whatever
had
been
used
to
blow
open
the
vault
had
been
more
effective
than
necessary
it
had
taken
the
whole
front
door
of
the
shop
and
both
windows
too
the
bent
and
twisted
paraglass
that
had
lain
on
the
pavement
showed
how
much
force
had
been
applied
from
within
and
yet
the
results
had
not
been
those
of
an
explosion
it
was
more
as
though
some
tremendous
force
had
outward
from
within
it
had
not
been
the
shattering
shock
of
high
explosive
but
some
great
thrust
that
had
unhurriedly
but
irresistibly
moved
everything
out
of
its
way
nothing
had
been
moved
very
far
as
it
would
have
been
by
a
blast
it
appeared
that
everything
had
simply
fallen
aside
as
though
scattered
by
a
giant
hand
the
main
braces
of
the
storefront
were
still
there
bent
outward
a
little
but
not
broken
the
vault
door
had
been
slammed
to
the
floor
of
the
shop
only
a
few
feet
from
the
front
door
the
vault
itself
had
been
farther
back
and
the
camera
had
showed
it
standing
wide
open
gaping
inside
there
had
been
pieces
of
fragile
glass
standing
on
the
shelves
unmoved
unharmed
the
force
whatever
it
had
been
had
moved
in
one
direction
only
from
a
point
within
the
vault
just
a
few
feet
from
the
door
pushing
outward
to
tear
out
the
heavy
door
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
paraffin
or
modeling
clay
stanton
had
recognized
the
vault
construction
type
the
voisier
construction
which
by
test
could
withstand
almost
everything
known
outside
of
the
actual
application
of
atomic
energy
itself
in
a
demonstration
several
years
before
a
voisier
vault
had
been
cut
open
by
a
team
of
technicians
it
had
taken
hours
for
them
to
breach
the
wall
and
they
had
had
no
fear
of
interruption
or
of
making
a
noise
or
of
setting
off
the
intricate
alarms
that
were
built
into
the
safe
itself
not
even
a
borazon
drill
could
make
much
of
an
impression
on
a
metal
which
had
been
formed
under
millions
of
atmospheres
of
pressure
and
yet
the
nipe
had
taken
that
door
out
in
a
second
without
much
effort
at
all
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
had
not
been
large
the
very
thought
of
the
nipe
kept
people
away
from
places
where
he
was
known
to
have
been
the
specter
of
the
nipe
evoked
a
fear
a
primitive
fear
fear
of
the
dark
and
fear
of
the
unknown
combined
with
the
rational
fear
of
a
very
real
very
tangible
danger
and
yet
there
been
a
crowd
of
onlookers
in
spite
of
their
fear
it
is
hard
to
keep
human
beings
from
being
curious
it
was
known
that
the
nipe
did
stay
around
after
he
had
struck
and
besides
the
area
was
now
full
of
armed
men
so
the
curious
came
to
look
and
to
stare
in
revulsion
at
the
neat
pile
of
gnawed
and
bloody
bones
that
had
been
the
night
watchman
carefully
killed
and
eaten
by
the
nipe
before
he
had
opened
the
vault
curiosity
does
make
fools
of
us
all
and
the
native
hue
of
caution
is
crimsoned
by
the
bright
red
of
morbid
stanton
went
through
the
door
of
the
automatic
restaurant
and
walked
over
to
the
vending
wall
the
big
dining
room
was
only
about
three
quarters
full
of
people
and
there
were
plenty
of
seats
available
he
fed
coins
into
the
proper
slots
took
his
sandwich
and
milk
over
to
a
seat
in
one
corner
and
made
himself
comfortable
he
flipped
open
the
newspaper
and
looked
at
the
front
page
and
for
a
moment
his
brain
seemed
to
freeze
the
story
itself
was
straightforward
enough
benchaim
kidnappers
nabbed
stan
martin
does
it
again
ceres
june
news
the
three
men
and
three
women
who
allegedly
kidnapped
shmuel
benchaim
were
brought
to
justice
today
through
the
efforts
of
stanley
martin
famed
investigator
for
lloyd
of
london
the
boy
held
prisoner
for
more
than
ten
weeks
on
a
small
planetoid
was
reported
in
good
health
according
to
john
vale
of
the
planetoid
police
the
kidnap
gang
could
not
have
been
taken
by
direct
assault
on
their
hideout
because
of
fear
that
the
boy
might
be
killed
the
operation
required
a
carefully
planned
infiltration
of
their
hideout
vale
said
martin
was
the
man
for
the
job
labeled
the
most
outrageous
kidnapping
in
history
the
affair
was
conceived
as
a
method
of
gaining
control
of
heavy
metals
incorporated

by
moishe
benchaim
the
boy
father
the
details
but
bart
stanton
was
interested
in
the
details
after
only
a
glance
through
the
first
part
of
the
article
his
eyes
returned
to
the
picture
that
had
caught
his
attention
the
line
of
print
beneath
it
identified
the
picture
as
being
that
of
a
man
named
stanley
martin
but
a
voice
in
bart
stanton
brain
said
stan
martin
the
name
is
mart
stanton
and
bartholomew
felt
a
roar
of
confusion
in
his
mind
because
he
know
who
mart
stanton
was
and
because
the
face
in
the
picture
was
his
own
he
was
walking
again
he
did
quite
remember
how
he
had
left
the
automat
and
he
really
did
even
try
to
remember
he
was
trying
to
remember
other
things
further
back
before
he
had
before
he
had
before
the
institute
before
the
beginning
of
the
operations
the
memories
were
there
all
right
he
could
sense
them
floating
in
some
sort
of
mental
limbo
just
beyond
the
grasp
of
his
conscious
mind
like
the
memories
of
a
dream
after
one
has
awakened
each
time
he
would
try
to
reach
into
the
darkness
to
grasp
one
of
the
pieces
it
would
shatter
into
smaller
bits
the
big
patterns
were
too
fragile
to
withstand
the
direct
probing
of
his
conscious
mind
and
even
the
resulting
fragments
did
not
want
to
hold
still
long
enough
to
be
analyzed
and
while
a
part
of
his
mind
probed
frantically
after
the
elusive
particles
of
memory
another
part
of
it
watched
the
process
with
amusement
he
had
always
known
there
were
holes
in
his
memory
do
kid
yourself
pal
but
it
was
disconcerting
to
find
an
area
that
was
as
full
of
holes
as
a
used
target
the
whole
fabric
had
been
punched
to
bits
no
man
memory
is
completely
available
at
any
given
time
whatever
the
recording
process
is
however
completely
every

sensory

is
probably
permanent

the

itself
the

that

speculate
on

about

these
are

more
fragile
a

might
glance
once
through
a
latin

and
have
each
and
every
page
imprinted
indelibly
on
his
recording
mechanism
and
still
be
unable
to
make
sense
out
of
in
cubitu
cum

sometimes
a
man
is
aware
of
the
holes
in
his
memory
what
the
name
of
that
fellow
i
met
at
eddie
party
ca
remember
it
for
the
life
of
me
at
other
times
a
memory
may
lay
dormant
and
completely
unremembered
leaving
no
apparent
gap
until
a
tag
of
some
kind
brings
it
up
that
girl
with
the
long
hair
reminds
me
of
suzie
blugerhugle
my
gosh
i
have
thought
of
her
in
years
both
factors
seemed
to
be
operating
in
bart
stanton
mind
at
this
time
incredibly
he
had
never
in
the
past
year
at
least
had
occasion
to
try
to
remember
much
about
his
past
life
he
had
known
who
he
was
without
thinking
about
it
particularly
and
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
language
history
social
behavior
politics
geography
and
so
on
had
been
readily
available
for
the
most
part
ask
an
educated
man
to
give
the
product
of
the
primes
and
or
ask
him
to
give
the
date
of
the
norman
conquest
and
he
can
give
you
the
answers
very
quickly
he
may
have
to
calculate
the
first
which
will
make
him
pause
for
a
second
before
answering
but
the
second
will
come
straight
out
of
his
memory
records
in
neither
case
does
he
have
to
think
of
where
he
learned
the
process
or
the
fact
or
who
taught
it
to
him
or
when
he
got
the
information
but
now
the
picture
and
the
name
in
the
paper
had
brought
forth
a
reaction
in
stanton
mind
and
he
was
trying
desperately
to
bring
the
information
out
of
oblivion
did
he
have
a
mother
surely
but
could
he
remember
her
certainly
a
pretty
gentle
rather
sad
woman
he
could
remember
when
she
died
although
he
could
remember
ever
having
actually
attended
the
funeral
what
about
his
father
try
as
he
might
he
could
find
no
memory
whatever
of
his
father
and
at
first
that
bothered
him
he
could
remember
his
mother
could
almost
see
her
moving
around
in
the
apartment
where
they
had
lived
in
in
in
denver
sure
and
he
could
remember
the
big
building
itself
and
the
block
and
even
frobisher
who
lived
upstairs
and
the
school
and
the
play
area
a
great
many
memories
came
crowding
back
but
there
was
no
trace
of
his
father
and
yet
oh
of
that
was
it
his
father
had
been
killed
in
an
accident
when
martinbart
were
very
young
the
name
flitted
through
his
mind
like
a
scrap
of
paper
in
a
high
wind
but
mentally
he
reached
out
and
grasped
it
martinbart
mart
bart
mart
bart
the
stanton
twins
it
was
very
curious
he
thought
that
he
should
have
forgotten
his
brother
and
even
more
curious
that
the
name
in
the
paper
had
not
brought
him
instantly
to
mind
martin
the
cripple
martin
the
boy
with
the
poor
weak
nervous
system
the
boy
who
had
had
to
stay
in
a
therapeutic
chair
all
his
life
because
his
efferent
nerves
could
not
control
his
body
the
boy
who
could
speak
or
rather
speak
because
he
was
ashamed
of
the
gibberish
that
resulted
martin
the
nonentity
the
nothing
the
nobody
the
one
who
watched
and
listened
and
thought
but
could
do
nothing
bart
stanton
stopped
suddenly
and
unfolded
the
newspaper
again
under
the
glow
of
the
streetlamp
his
memories
certainly
did
jibe
with
his
eyes
ran
down
the
column
of
type
martin
has
in
the
years
since
he
has
been
in
the
belt
run
up
an
enviable
record
both
as
an
insurance
investigator
and
as
a
police
detective
although
his
connection
with
the
planetoid
police
is
necessarily
an
unofficial
one
probably
not
since
sherlock
holmes
has
there
been
such
mutual
respect
and
between
the
official
police
and
a
private
investigator
there
was
only
one
explanation
stanton
thought
martin
too
had
been
treated
by
the
institute
his
memory
was
still
blurry
and
incomplete
he
knew
but
he
did
suddenly
remember
that
a
decision
had
been
made
for
martin
to
take
the
treatment
he
chuckled
a
little
at
the
irony
of
it
it
looked
as
though
they
been
able
to
make
a
superman
of
martin
but
they
been
able
to
make
a
normal
and
extraordinarily
capable
human
being
of
him
he
thought
now
it
was
bart
who
was
the
freak
the
odd
one
about
is
fair
he
thought
but
somehow
it
did
seem
quite
fair
he
crumpled
the
newspaper
dropped
it
into
a
nearby
waste
chute
and
walked
on
through
the
night
toward
the
neurophysical
institute
you
understand
stanton
said
the
psychiatrist
that
a
great
part
of
martin
trouble
is
mental
as
well
as
physical
because
of
the
nature
of
his
ailment
he
has
withdrawn
pulled
himself
away
from
communication
with
others
if
these
symptoms
had
been
brought
to
my
attention
earlier
the
mental
disturbance
might
have
been
more
easily
analyzed
and
treated
i
suppose
so
i
sorry
doctor
said
stanton
her
manner
betrayed
weariness
and
pain
it
was
so
so
difficult
martin
could
never
talk
very
well
you
know
and
he
just
talked
less
and
less
as
the
years
went
by
it
was
so
slow
and
so
gradual
that
i
never
really
noticed
it
the
doctor
thought
not
well
herself
she
should
have
married
again
years
ago
rather
than
force
herself
to
carry
the
whole
burden
alone
her
role
as
a
doting
mother
has
helped
either
of
the
boys
to
overcome
the
handicaps
that
were
already
i
honestly
tried
to
do
my
very
best
with
martin
stanton
went
on
unhappily
and
so
has
bart
i
know
when
they
were
younger
bart
used
to
take
him
out
all
the
time
they
went
everywhere
together
of
course
i
do
expect
bart
to
do
that
so
much
any
more
he
has
his
own
life
to
live
he
ca
take
martin
out
on
dates
or
things
like
that
he
has
interests
outside
the
home
now
like
other
boys
his
age
that
only
normal
but
when
he
at
home
bart
helps
me
with
martin
all
the
time
i
understand
said
the
psychiatrist
is
no
time
to
tell
her
that
bartholomew
tests
indicate
that
he
has
subconsciously
resented
martin
presence
for
a
long
he
thought
has
enough
to
worry
do
understand
said
stanton
breaking
into
sudden
tears
i
just
do
understand
why
martin
should
behave
this
way
why
should
he
just
sit
there
with
his
eyes
closed
and
ignore
everybody
why
should
he
ignore
his
mother
and
his
brother
why
the
doctor
comforted
her
in
a
warmly
professional
manner
then
as
her
tears
subsided
he
said
we
do
understand
all
the
factors
ourselves
stanton
at
first
glance
martin
reactions
appear
to
be
those
one
would
expect
of
schizophrenic
withdrawal
but
there
are
certain
aspects
of
the
case
that
make
it
unusual
his
behavior
does
quite
follow
the
pattern
we
usually
expect
from
such
cases
as
this
his
extreme
physical
disability
has
drastically
modified
the
course
of
his
mental
development
and
at
the
same
time
made
it
difficult
for
us
to
make
any
analysis
of
his
mental
state
he
added
to
himself
had
followed
the
advice
of
her
family
physician
years
ago
if
she
had
only
put
the
boy
under
the
proper
care
none
of
this
would
have
is
there
we
can
do
doctor
she
asked
we
do
know
yet
he
said
gently
he
considered
for
a
moment
then
said
stanton
i
like
for
you
to
leave
both
of
the
boys
here
for
a
few
days
so
that
we
can
perform
further
tests
that
will
help
us
a
great
deal
in
evaluating
the
circumstances
and
help
us
get
at
the
root
of
martin
trouble
she
looked
at
him
with
a
little
surprise
why
yes
of
course
if
you
think
it
necessary
but
why
should
bart
stay
the
doctor
weighed
his
words
carefully
before
he
spoke
bart
will
be
what
we
call
a
stanton
since
the
boys
are
genetically
identical
they
should
have
been
a
great
deal
alike
in
personality
as
well
as
in
body
if
it
had
been
for
martin
accident
in
other
words
our
tests
of
bart
will
tell
us
what
martin
be
like
that
way
we
can
tell
just
how
much
and
in
what
way
martin
deviates
from
what
he
should
ideally
be
do
you
understand
yes
yes
i
see
all
right
doctor
whatever
you
say
after
stanton
had
left
the
psychiatrist
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
and
stared
thoughtfully
at
his
desk
top
for
several
minutes
then
making
his
decision
he
picked
up
a
small
book
that
lay
on
his
desk
and
looked
up
a
number
in
arlington
virginia
he
punched
out
the
number
on
his
phone
and
when
the
face
appeared
on
his
screen
he
said
hello
sidney
busy
right
now
not
particularly
not
for
a
few
minutes
what
up
i
have
a
very
interesting
case
out
here
that
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
do
you
happen
to
have
a
telepath
who
strong
enough
to
take
a
meshing
with
an
insane
mind
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
i
will
need
a
man
with
an
absolutely
impregnable
sense
of
identity
because
he
going
to
get
into
the
weirdest
situation
i
ever
come
across
the
nipe
squatted
brooding
in
his
underground
nest
waiting
for
the
special
crystallization
process
to
take
place
in
the
alloy
that
was
forming
in
the
reactor
long
he
wondered
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
complex
crystallization
reaction
he
knew
the
timing
of
that
to
a
fraction
of
a
second
his
dark
thoughts
were
instead
focused
inwardly
upon
himself
how
long
would
it
be
before
he
would
be
able
to
construct
the
communicator
that
would
span
the
of
intervening
distance
and
put
him
in
touch
with
his
own
race
again
how
long
would
it
be
before
he
could
again
hold
discourse
with
reasonable
beings
how
much
longer
would
he
have
to
be
stranded
on
this
planet
surrounded
by
an
insane
society
composed
of
degraded
insane
beings
the
work
was
going
incredibly
slowly
he
had
known
at
the
beginning
that
his
knowledge
of
the
basic
arts
required
to
build
a
communicator
was
incomplete
but
he
had
not
realized
just
how
painfully
inadequate
it
was
time
after
time
his
instruments
had
simply
refused
to
function
because
of
some
basic
flaw
in
their
manufacture
some
flaw
that
an
expert
in
that
field
could
have
pointed
out
at
once
time
after
time
equipment
had
had
to
be
rebuilt
almost
from
the
beginning
and
time
after
time
only
methods
were
available
for
correcting
his
errors
not
even
his
prodigious
and
accurate
memory
could
hold
all
the
information
that
was
necessary
for
the
work
and
there
were
no
reference
tapes
available
of
course
they
had
all
been
destroyed
when
his
ship
had
crashed
he
had
long
since
given
up
any
attempt
to
understand
the
functioning
of
the
mad
that
surrounded
him
he
was
quite
certain
that
the
beings
he
had
seen
could
not
possibly
be
the
real
rulers
of
this
society
but
he
had
no
inkling
as
yet
as
to
who
the
real
rulers
were
as
to
they
were
that
question
seemed
a
little
easier
to
answer
it
was
highly
probable
that
they
were
out
in
space
on
the
asteroids
that
his
instruments
had
detected
when
he
was
dropping
in
toward
this
planet
so
many
years
before
he
had
made
an
error
then
in
not
landing
in
the
belt
but
at
no
time
since
had
he
experienced
the
emotion
of
regret
or
wished
he
had
done
differently
both
thoughts
would
have
been
incomprehensible
to
the
nipe
he
had
made
an
error
the
circumstances
had
been
checked
and
noted
he
would
not
make
that
error
again
what
further
action
could
be
taken
by
a
logical
mind
none
the
past
was
immutable
and
unchangeable
it
existed
only
as
a
memory
in
his
own
mind
and
there
was
no
way
to
change
that
indelible
record
even
had
the
nipe
wished
to
do
so
insane
a
thing
surely
he
thought
the
real
rulers
must
know
of
his
existence
he
had
tried
by
his
every
action
to
show
that
he
was
a
reasoning
intelligent
and
civilized
being
why
then
had
they
taken
no
action
there
was
of
course
the
possibility
that
the
rulers
cared
very
little
for
their
subjects
here
on
earth
that
they
ignored
what
went
on
most
of
the
time
still
it
would
seem
that
they
would
recognize
the
actions
of
one
of
their
own
kind
and
take
steps
to
investigate
he
was
still
not
absolutely
certain
about
colonel
walther
mannheim
was
he
a
real
person
or
merely
an
underling
the
information
on
the
man
was
pitifully
small
it
would
of
course
be
possible
to
wait
to
see
how
colonel
walther
mannheim
behaved
if
and
when
he
discovered
the
nest
but
if
he
had
not
discovered
it
after
all
these
years
and
the
information
indicated
that
he
had
been
looking
almost
since
the
first
then
it
was
unlikely
that
he
was
a
real
person
in
which
case
it
would
be
dangerous
to
allow
him
to
find
the
nest
no
the
best
plan
of
action
would
be
to
go
to
colonel
walther
mannheim
first
pok
ping
pok
ping
pok
ping
pok
ping
the
action
around
the
handball
court
was
beautiful
to
watch
the
robot
mechanism
behind
bart
stanton
would
fire
out
a
ball
at
random
intervals
ranging
from
a
tenth
to
a
quarter
of
a
second
bouncing
them
off
the
wall
in
a
random
pattern
stanton
would
retrieve
the
ball
before
it
hit
the
ground
and
bounce
it
off
the
wall
again
to
strike
the
target
on
the
moving
robot
stanton
had
to
work
against
a
machine
no
ordinary
human
being
could
have
given
him
any
competition
pok
ping
pok
ping
pok
plunk
one
miss
stanton
said
to
himself
but
he
fielded
the
next
one
nicely
and
slammed
it
home
pok
ping
the
physical
therapist
who
was
standing
to
one
side
well
out
of
the
way
of
those
drives
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
time
pok
ping
the
machine
having
delivered
its
last
ball
shut
itself
off
with
a
smug
click
stanton
turned
away
from
the
handball
court
and
walked
toward
the
physical
therapist
who
was
holding
out
a
robe
for
him
that
was
good
bart
he
said
real
good
one
miss
stanton
said
as
he
shrugged
into
the
robe
yeah
your
timing
was
off
a
shade
there
i
guess
it
hard
for
me
to
tell
till
i
look
at
the
photographs
your
arms
and
hands
are
just
blurs
to
me
when
they
moving
that
fast
but
you
managed
to
chop
another
ten
seconds
off
your
previous
record
anyway
stanton
looked
at
him
you
reset
the
timer
again
he
said
accusingly
but
there
was
a
grin
on
his
face
the
man
grinned
back
yup
come
on
step
into
the
mummy
case
he
waved
toward
the
narrow
niche
in
the
wall
of
the
court
a
niche
just
big
enough
to
hold
a
standing
man
stanton
stepped
in
and
various
instrument
pickups
came
out
of
the
walls
and
touched
him
at
various
points
on
his
body
hidden
machines
recorded
his
heartbeat
his
blood
pressure
his
brain
activity
his
muscular
tension
his
breathing
and
several
other
factors
after
a
minute
the
man
said
okay
bart
that
it
let
hit
the
steam
box
stanton
stepped
out
of
the
niche
and
accompanied
the
therapist
to
another
room
where
he
took
off
the
robe
again
and
sat
down
on
the
small
stool
inside
an
ordinary
steam
box
the
box
closed
leaving
his
head
free
and
the
box
began
to
fill
with
steam
did
i
ever
tell
you
just
what
it
is
that
i
do
like
about
that
machine
stanton
asked
as
the
therapist
draped
a
heavy
towel
around
his
head
nope
did
know
you
had
any
gripe
what
is
it
you
ca
gloat
after
you
beat
it
you
ca
walk
over
and
pat
it
on
the
shoulder
and
say
better
luck
next
time
old
man
it
is
a
good
loser
and
it
is
a
bad
loser
the
damned
thing
does
even
know
it
lost
and
even
if
it
did
it
would
care
yeah
i
see
what
you
mean
said
the
man
chuckling
you
beat
the
pants
off
it
and
what
get
nothing
not
even
a
case
of
the
sulks
out
of
it
exactly
and
what
worse
i
know
perfectly
good
and
well
that
only
half
trying
the
stupid
gadget
could
beat
me
easily
if
you
just
turned
that
knob
over
a
little
more
yeah
sure
but
you
not
competing
against
the
machine
anyway
the
therapist
said
what
you
doing
you
competing
against
yourself
trying
to
beat
your
own
record
i
know
and
what
happens
when
i
ca
do
any
more
either
stanton
asked
i
ca
just
go
on
getting
better
and
better
forever
i
got
limits
you
know
sure
said
the
therapist
easily
so
does
anybody
so
does
a
golf
player
for
instance
you
take
a
golf
player
he
goes
out
and
practices
by
himself
to
try
to
beat
his
own
record
bunk
hogwash
the
real
fun
in
game
is
beating
someone
else
the
big
kick
in
golf
is
winning
over
the
other
guy
in
a
twosome
how
about
crossword
puzzles
or
solitaire
when
you
solve
a
crossword
puzzle
you
beaten
the
guy
who
made
up
the
puzzle
when
you
play
solitaire
you
playing
against
the
laws
of
chance
and
that
can
become
pretty
boring
unless
there
money
on
it
and
in
that
case
you
actually
trying
to
beat
the
guy
who
betting
against
you
what
i
like
to
do
is
get
out
on
the
golf
course
with
someone
else
and
do
my
best
and
then
lose
honestly
with
a
handicap
the
therapist
began
then
he
grinned
weakly
and
stopped
on
the
golf
course
stanton
was
impossibly
good
it
had
taken
him
a
little
while
to
get
the
knack
of
it
but
as
soon
as
he
got
control
of
his
club
and
knew
the
reactions
of
the
ball
his
score
started
plummeting
now
it
was
so
low
as
to
be
almost
ridiculous
one
long
drive
to
the
green
and
one
putt
to
the
cup
an
easy
strokes
for
eighteen
holes
an
occasional
sometimes
brought
his
score
down
below
that
an
occasional
wormcast
or
stray
wind
sometimes
brought
it
up
sure
said
stanton
a
handicap
what
kind
of
a
handicap
do
you
want
me
to
give
you
to
induce
you
to
make
a
bet
on
a
handball
game
with
me
the
physical
therapist
could
imagine
himself
trying
to
get
under
one
of
stanton
returns
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
to
his
hand
if
he
were
accidentally
to
catch
one
made
him
wince
we
would
even
be
playing
the
same
game
said
stanton
the
therapist
stepped
back
and
looked
at
stanton
you
know
he
said
puzzledly
you
sound
bitter
sure
i
bitter
stanton
said
all
i
ever
get
is
just
exercise
all
the
fun
has
gone
out
of
it
he
sighed
and
grinned
there
was
no
point
in
upsetting
the
man
i
guess
i
just
have
to
stick
to
cards
and
chess
if
i
want
competition
speed
and
strength
do
help
anything
if
i
holding
two
pair
against
three
of
a
kind
before
the
therapist
could
say
anything
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
lean
man
stepped
into
the
foggy
air
of
the
room
you
are
broiling
a
lobster
he
asked
the
man
blandly
steaming
a
clam
the
therapist
corrected
when
he
done
i
pound
him
to
chowder
excellent
i
came
for
a
clambake
you
early
then
george
stanton
said
he
did
feel
much
in
the
mood
for
lightness
and
the
appearance
of
yoritomo
did
nothing
to
improve
his
humor
george
yoritomo
beamed
broadly
crinkling
up
his
narrow
eyes
ah
a
talking
clam
excellent
how
much
longer
does
this
fine
specimen
of
clamhood
have
to
cook
he
asked
the
man
about
more
minutes
excellent
said
yoritomo
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
return
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
therapist
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
then
opened
it
again
and
said
sure
doc
i
can
get
some
other
stuff
done
i
see
you
in
minutes
but
do
let
him
out
of
there
till
i
get
back
he
went
out
through
the
far
door
after
the
door
closed
yoritomo
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
there
have
been
new
developments
he
said
as
you
may
have
surmised
the
physical
therapist
like
many
other
of
the
personnel
around
the
institute
knew
of
stanton
abilities
but
he
did
know
the
purpose
of
the
long
series
of
operations
that
had
made
him
what
he
was
such
persons
knew
about
stanton
himself
but
they
knew
nothing
of
any
connection
with
the
nipe
although
they
might
suspect
and
all
of
them
kept
their
knowledge
and
their
suspicions
to
themselves
i
guessed
stanton
said
what
is
it
george
he
flexed
his
muscles
under
the
caress
of
the
hot
moist
currents
in
the
box
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
important
that
the
psychologist
interrupt
him
while
he
was
relaxing
after
strenuous
exercise
yoritomo
looked
excited
in
spite
of
his
attempt
to
be
calm
and
yet
stanton
knew
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
anything
tremendously
urgent
or
yoritomo
would
be
acting
a
great
deal
differently
yoritomo
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
thin
lips
in
an
excited
smile
his
eyes
sparkling
i
had
to
come
tell
you
the
sheer
utter
beauty
of
it
is
too
much
to
contain
three
times
in
a
row
was
almost
absolute
bart
the
probability
that
our
hypotheses
were
correct
was
computed
as
straight
nines
to
seven
decimals
but
now
the
fourth
time
straight
nines
to
decimals
stanton
lifted
an
eyebrow
your
oriental
calm
is
deserting
you
george
i
not
reading
you
yoritomo
smile
became
broader
ah
sorry
i
refer
to
the
theory
we
have
been
discussing
about
the
peculiar
mentality
of
our
friend
the
nipe
you
remember
stanton
remembered
after
six
years
of
watching
the
recorded
actions
of
the
nipe
yoritomo
had
evolved
a
theory
about
the
kind
of
mentality
that
lay
behind
the
four
baleful
violet
eyes
in
that
snouted
alien
head
in
order
that
his
theory
be
validated
it
was
necessary
that
the
theory
be
able
to
predict
in
broad
terms
the
future
actions
of
the
nipe
evidently
that
proof
had
now
come
the
psychologist
was
smiling
and
rubbing
his
long
bony
hands
together
for
george
yoritomo
that
was
almost
the
equivalent
of
hysterical
excitement
we
have
been
able
to
predict
the
behavior
of
the
nipe
he
said
for
the
fourth
time
in
succession
great
stanton
said
congratulations
george
but
how
does
that
fit
in
with
the
rule
you
once
told
me
about
you
know
the
one
about
experimental
animals
ah
yes
yoritomo
said
nodding
his
head
agreeably
the
harvard
law
of
animal
behavior
genetically
standardized
strain
under
precisely
controlled
laboratory
conditions
when
subjected
to
carefully
calibrated
stimuli
will
behave
as
it
damned
well
pleases
yes
very
true
he
held
up
a
cautionary
finger
but
an
animal
could
not
do
otherwise
could
it
only
as
it
pleases
could
it
do
anything
else
it
could
not
please
to
behave
as
something
it
is
not
could
it
draw
me
a
picture
stanton
said
what
i
mean
yoritomo
said
is
that
any
organism
is
limited
in
its
choice
of
behavior
a
hamster
for
example
can
not
choose
to
behave
in
the
manner
of
a
rhesus
monkey
a
dog
can
not
choose
to
react
as
a
mouse
would
react
if
i
prick
a
white
mouse
with
a
needle
it
may
squeal
or
bite
or
jump
but
it
will
not
bark
never
nor
will
it
under
any
circumstances
leap
to
a
trapeze
hang
by
its
tail
and
chatter
curses
at
me
never
stanton
chuckled
but
he
did
comment
by
observing
an
organism
reactions
the
psychologist
continued
one
can
begin
to
see
a
pattern
after
long
enough
observation
the
pattern
almost
approaches
certainty
if
for
instance
i
tell
you
that
i
put
an
armful
of
hay
into
a
certain
animal
enclosure
and
that
the
animal
trotted
over
ate
the
hay
and
brayed
then
you
will
be
able
to
tell
me
with
reasonable
certainty
whether
or
not
the
animal
had
long
ears
do
you
see
sure
but
you
have
been
able
to
pinpoint
the
nipe
activities
that
easily
yet
have
you
stanton
asked
ah
no
said
yoritomo
not
at
all
that
was
merely
an
analogy
and
we
must
not
make
the
mistake
of
carrying
an
analogy
too
far
the
more
intelligent
a
creature
is
the
greater
in
general
is
its
scope
of
action
the
nipe
is
far
from
being
so
simple
as
a
monkey
or
a
hamster
on
the
other
hand
he
smiled
widely
showing
bright
white
he
is
not
so
bright
as
a
human
being
stanton
looked
at
him
skeptically
i
would
say
he
was
exactly
stupid
george
what
about
all
those
prize
gadgets
of
his
he
blinked
wipe
the
sweat
off
my
forehead
will
you
it
running
into
my
eyes
yoritomo
wiped
with
the
towel
as
he
continued
ah
yes
he
is
quite
capable
in
that
respect
my
friend
quite
capable
that
is
because
of
his
great
memory
at
once
his
finest
asset
and
his
greatest
curse
he
draped
the
towel
around
stanton
head
again
and
stepped
back
his
face
unsmiling
imagine
having
a
memory
bart
stanton
jaw
muscles
tightened
a
little
before
he
spoke
i
think
like
it
he
said
yoritomo
shrugged
slightly
perhaps
you
would
but
it
would
most
certainly
not
be
the
asset
you
think
look
at
it
very
soberly
my
friend
the
most
difficult
teaching
job
in
the
world
is
the
attempt
to
teach
an
organism
something
that
that
organism
already
knows
true
yes
if
a
man
already
knows
the
shape
of
the
earth
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
teach
him
if
he
for
example
that
the
earth
is
flat
but
round
like
a
pancake
your
contention
that
it
is
round
like
a
ball
will
make
no
impression
upon
his
mind
whatever
he
you
see
he
now
imagine
a
race
with
a
perfect
memory
a
memory
that
never
fades
a
memory
in
which
each
bit
of
data
is
as
bright
and
as
fresh
as
the
moment
it
was
imprinted
and
as
readily
available
as
the
data
stored
in
a
robot
mind
it
is
in
effect
a
robotic
memory
if
you
put
false
data
into
the
memory
banks
of
a
mathematical
computer
such
as
telling
it
that
the
square
of
two
is
five
you
can
not
correct
that
error
simply
by
telling
it
the
true
fact
that
the
square
of
two
is
four
no
first
you
must
remove
the
erroneous
data
not
so
agreed
stanton
said
very
good
then
let
us
look
at
the
nipe
race
wherever
it
was
spawned
in
this
universe
let
us
look
at
the
race
a
long
time
back
way
back
when
they
first
became
back
when
they
first
developed
a
true
language
each
little
nipe
child
as
it
is
born
or
hatched
or
budded
whatever
it
is
they
do
is
taught
as
rapidly
as
possible
all
the
things
it
must
know
in
order
to
survive
and
once
a
little
nipelet
is
taught
a
thing
it
that
knowledge
is
there
and
it
is
permanent
and
it
can
be
brought
instantly
to
the
fore
and
if
it
is
taught
a
falsehood
then
it
can
not
be
taught
the
truth
you
see
stanton
thought
about
it
well
yes
but
eventually
there
are
going
to
be
cases
where
reality
does
jibe
with
what
he
been
taught
there
and
would
cold
reality
force
a
change
ah
in
some
cases
yes
in
most
no
said
yoritomo
look
suppose
one
of
these
primordial
nipes
runs
across
a
tiger
or
whatever
large
carnivore
passes
for
a
tiger
on
their
home
planet
this
nipe
let
us
say
has
never
seen
a
tiger
before
so
he
does
not
observe
that
this
particular
tiger
is
old
ill
and
weak
it
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
its
last
legs
our
primordial
nipe
hits
it
on
the
head
and
it
drops
dead
he
drags
the
body
home
for
the
family
to
feed
upon
did
you
kill
it
papa
it
was
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
my
child
i
walked
up
to
it
bashed
it
firmly
on
the
noggin
and
it
died
that
is
the
way
to
kill
tigers
yoritomo
smiled
it
is
also
a
good
way
to
kill
nipes
eh
he
took
the
towel
and
wiped
stanton
brow
again
the
error
he
continued
was
made
when
papa
nipe
made
the
generalization
from
tiger
to
tigers
if
tigers
were
rare
this
erroneous
bit
of
lore
might
be
passed
on
for
many
generations
unchecked
and
spread
through
the
nipe
community
as
time
passed
those
who
did
learn
that
most
tigers
are
conquered
by
walking
up
to
them
and
hitting
them
on
the
noggin
undoubtedly
died
before
they
could
pass
this
new
bit
of
information
on
then
perhaps
one
day
a
nipe
survived
the
ordeal
his
mind
now
contained
conflicting
information
which
must
be
resolved
he
that
tigers
are
killed
in
this
way
he
also
that
this
one
was
not
so
obliging
as
to
die
what
is
wrong
ha
he
has
the
solution
plainly
particular
beast
not
a
how
does
he
explain
that
to
the
others
stanton
asked
what
does
he
tell
his
children
yoritomo
asked
rhetorically
why
first
he
tells
them
how
tigers
are
killed
you
walk
up
to
one
and
bash
it
on
the
head
but
then
he
warns
his
little
nipelets
that
there
is
an
animal
around
that
looks
a
tiger
but
it
is
a
tiger
one
should
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
it
a
tiger
or
one
will
get
oneself
badly
hurt
now
since
the
only
way
to
tell
the
true
tiger
from
the
false
is
to
give
it
a
hit
on
the
head
and
since
that
test
may
prove
rather
injurious
if
not
absolutely
fatal
to
the
nipe
who
tries
it
it
follows
that
one
is
better
off
if
one
scrupulously
avoids
all
animals
that
look
like
tigers
you
see
yeah
said
stanton
some
snarks
are
boojums
exactly
thank
you
for
that
allusion
yoritomo
said
with
a
smile
i
must
remember
to
use
it
in
my
report
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
stanton
said
musingly
that
there
would
inevitably
be
some
things
that
they
never
learn
the
truth
about
once
they
had
gotten
the
wrong
idea
into
their
heads
ah
indeed
absolutely
true
it
is
precisely
that
which
led
me
to
formulate
my
theory
in
the
first
place
how
else
are
we
to
explain
that
the
nipe
for
all
his
tremendous
technical
knowledge
is
nonetheless
a
member
of
a
society
that
is
still
in
the
ancient
stage
of
development
a
savage
yoritomo
laughed
softly
as
to
his
savagery
i
think
no
one
on
earth
would
disagree
but
they
are
not
the
same
thing
what
i
do
mean
is
that
the
nipe
is
undoubtedly
the
most
superstitious
and
bigoted
being
on
the
face
of
this
planet
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
of
the
steam
room
yes
said
yoritomo
the
physical
therapist
stuck
his
head
in
sorry
to
interrupt
but
the
clam
is
done
i
have
to
give
him
a
rubdown
doc
perfectly
all
right
yoritomo
said
we
had
almost
finished
think
over
what
i
have
said
eh
bart
yeah
sure
george
stanton
said
abstractedly
yoritomo
left
and
stanton
got
up
on
the
rubdown
table
and
lay
prone
the
therapist
seeing
that
his
patient
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
proceeded
with
the
massage
in
silence
stanton
lay
on
the
table
his
head
pillowed
in
his
arms
while
the
therapist
rubbed
and
kneaded
his
muscles
the
pleasant
sensation
formed
a
background
for
his
thoughts
for
the
first
time
stanton
was
seeing
the
nipe
as
an
individual
as
a
person
as
a
thinking
feeling
being
have
a
great
deal
in
common
you
and
he
thought
that
you
a
lot
worse
off
than
i
actually
feeling
sorry
for
the
poor
stanton
thought
i
suppose
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
feeling
sorry
for
myself
the
only
real
basic
difference
between
us
freaks
is
that
you
more
of
a
freak
than
i
am
molly
and
the
colonel
lady
are
sisters
under
the
skin
that
come
from
something
i
learned
in
school
no
doubt
like
the
snarks
and
the
would
answer
hi
to
any
loud
cry
such
fry
me
fritter
my
wig
was
that
the
snark
no
the
snark
had
a
flavor
like
that
of
and
i
must
remember
to
distinguish
those
that
have
feathers
and
bite
from
those
that
have
whiskers
and
damn
memory
of
mine
can
i
even
call
it
mine
when
i
ca
even
use
it
for
now
we
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
now
i
know
in
part
but
then
shall
i
know
even
as
also
i
am
known
thought
popping
up
from
only
way
i
ever
get
all
of
this
stuff
straightened
out
in
my
mind
is
to
get
more
information
and
it
does
look
as
though
anyone
is
going
to
give
it
to
me
on
a
platter
either
the
institute
men
seem
to
be
awfully
chary
about
giving
information
away
even
to
me
george
even
had
to
chase
away
old
that
feels
good
before
he
would
talk
about
the
nipe
ca
blame
for
that
of
course
there
be
hell
to
pay
for
everyone
around
if
the
general
public
ever
found
out
that
the
nipe
has
been
kept
as
a
pet
for
six
many
people
has
he
killed
in
that
time
twenty
thirty
how
much
blood
does
colonel
mannheim
have
on
his
hands
they
know
not
why
or
for
what
they
give
still
the
few
must
die
that
the
many
may
wonder
whether
i
read
all
that
stuff
complete
or
just
browsed
through
a
copy
of
quotations
got
to
get
organized
around
here
brother
colonel
puppet
is
going
to
have
to
cut
his
strings
and
do
a
colonel
walther
mannheim
unlocked
the
door
of
his
small
suite
of
rooms
in
the
officers
barracks
god
he
was
tired
it
was
so
much
physical
exhaustion
as
mental
and
emotional
release
from
the
tension
he
had
been
under
for
the
preceding
few
hours
or
had
it
been
years
he
dropped
his
heavy
briefcase
on
a
nearby
chair
took
off
his
cap
and
dropped
it
on
the
briefcase
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
tiredly
around
everything
was
in
order
as
usual
he
seldom
came
to
government
city
any
more
twenty
or
so
visits
in
the
last
ten
years
and
only
a
dozen
of
them
had
been
long
enough
to
force
him
to
spend
the
night
in
his
old
suite
at
the
world
police
headquarters
at
the
southern
end
of
the
island
he
did
like
to
stay
in
government
city
it
made
him
uneasy
being
this
close
to
the
nipe
underground
nest
the
nipe
had
too
many
taps
into
government
communication
channels
too
many
ways
of
seeing
and
hearing
what
went
on
here
in
the
nerve
center
of
civilization
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
this
whole
operation
had
been
the
careful
balancing
of
information
flow
through
those
channels
that
the
nipe
had
tapped
to
stop
using
them
would
betray
immediately
to
that
alien
mind
that
his
taps
had
been
detected
the
information
flow
must
go
on
as
usual
there
was
no
way
to
censor
the
information
either
although
it
was
known
that
the
nipe
relied
on
them
for
planning
his
raids
but
since
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
even
after
years
of
observation
what
sort
of
thing
the
nipe
would
be
wanting
next
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
which
information
should
be
removed
from
the
tapped
channels
and
most
certainly
removing
information
about
every
possible
material
that
the
nipe
might
want
would
make
him
even
more
suspicious
than
simply
shutting
down
the
channels
altogether
to
shut
them
down
would
only
indicate
that
the
human
government
had
detected
his
taps
to
censor
them
heavily
would
indicate
that
a
trap
was
being
laid
it
was
even
impossible
to
censor
out
news
about
the
nipe
that
too
would
have
invited
suspicion
so
a
special
corps
of
men
had
been
set
up
a
group
whose
sole
job
was
to
investigate
every
raid
of
the
nipe
every
raid
produced
a
flurry
of
activity
by
this
special
group
they
rushed
out
to
look
over
the
scene
of
the
raid
prowled
around
and
did
everything
that
might
be
expected
of
an
investigative
body
their
reports
were
sent
in
over
the
usual
channels
all
the
actual
data
they
came
up
with
was
sent
straight
through
the
normal
channels
but
the
conclusions
they
reached
from
that
data
were
not
always
in
spite
of
everything
the
messages
indicated
that
the
police
were
as
baffled
as
before
all
other
information
relating
to
the
nipe
went
through
special
channels
known
to
be
untapped
by
the
nipe
and
yet
there
was
no
way
to
be
absolutely
certain
of
the
sum
total
of
the
information
that
the
nipe
received
believing
as
he
did
in
the
existence
of
real
people
he
would
necessarily
assume
that
communication
systems
were
hidden
from
him
and
the
more
difficult
they
were
to
find
the
more
certain
he
would
be
that
they
existed
and
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
information
the
nipe
picked
up
when
he
was
out
on
a
raid
away
from
the
spying
devices
that
had
been
hidden
in
his
tunnels
mannheim
walked
across
the
small
living
room
to
the
sideboard
that
stood
against
one
wall
and
opened
a
door
fresh
ice
soda
and
a
bottle
of
scotch
were
waiting
for
him
he
took
one
of
the
glasses
dropped
in
three
of
the
cubes
of
ice
added
a
precisely
measured
ounce
and
a
half
of
scotch
and
filled
the
glass
to
within
an
inch
of
the
brim
with
soda
holding
the
glass
in
one
hand
he
walked
around
the
little
apartment
checking
everything
with
a
sort
of
automatic
abstractedness
the
air
conditioner
was
pouring
sweet
cool
fresh
air
into
the
room
the
windows
heavy
thick
slabs
of
paraglass
welded
directly
into
the
wall
admitted
the
light
from
the
courtyard
outside
but
admitted
nothing
else
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
open
because
of
the
air
conditioning
a
century
before
some
buildings
still
had
fire
escapes
running
down
their
outsides
but
modern
fireproofing
had
rendered
such
anachronisms
unnecessary
but
his
mind
was
only
partly
on
his
surroundings
he
went
into
the
bedroom
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
took
a
long
drink
from
the
cold
glass
in
his
hand
and
then
put
it
on
the
nightstand
absently
he
began
pulling
off
his
boots
his
thoughts
were
on
the
executive
session
he
had
attended
that
afternoon
how
much
longer
do
you
think
colonel
a
few
weeks
sir
perhaps
less
there
was
another
raid
in
miami
colonel
another
man
died
we
could
have
prevented
that
death
colonel
we
could
have
prevented
a
great
many
deaths
in
the
past
six
years
and
what
answer
was
there
to
that
the
executive
council
knew
that
the
deaths
were
preventable
in
only
one
way
by
killing
the
nipe
and
they
had
long
ago
agreed
that
the
knowledge
in
that
alien
mind
was
worth
the
sacrifice
but
as
he
had
known
would
happen
when
they
made
the
decision
six
years
before
there
were
some
of
them
who
had
inevitably
weakened
not
all
not
even
a
majority
but
a
minority
that
was
becoming
stronger
it
had
been
to
a
great
degree
mannheim
arguments
that
had
convinced
them
then
and
now
they
were
tending
to
shift
the
blame
for
their
decision
to
mannheim
shoulders
most
of
the
executives
were
realistic
men
they
were
not
going
to
step
out
now
unless
there
were
good
reason
for
it
but
if
the
subtle
undercutting
of
the
vacillating
minority
weakened
mannheim
own
resolve
or
if
he
failed
to
give
solid
answers
to
their
questions
then
the
whole
project
would
begin
to
crumble
rapidly
he
had
not
directly
answered
the
executive
who
had
pointed
out
that
many
lives
could
have
been
saved
if
the
nipe
had
been
killed
six
years
ago
there
was
no
use
in
fighting
back
on
such
puerile
terms
gentlemen
within
a
few
weeks
we
will
be
ready
to
send
stanton
in
after
the
nipe
if
that
fails
we
can
blast
him
out
of
his
stronghold
within
minutes
afterwards
but
if
we
stop
now
if
we
allow
our
judgment
to
be
colored
at
this
point
then
all
those
who
have
died
in
the
past
six
years
will
have
died
in
vain
he
had
gone
on
exploring
and
explaining
the
ramifications
of
the
plans
for
the
next
few
weeks
but
he
had
carefully
kept
it
on
the
same
level
it
had
been
an
emotional
sort
of
speech
but
it
had
been
purposely
so
in
answer
to
the
sort
of
emotionalism
that
the
weakening
minority
had
attempted
to
use
on
him
men
had
died
yes
but
what
of
that
men
had
died
before
for
far
less
worthwhile
causes
and
men
do
what
they
will
will
die
eventually
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
had
recalled
the
of
some
sergeant
of
the
old
united
states
marines
during
an
early
war
as
he
led
his
men
over
the
top
he
had
shouted
on
you
sons
of
bitches
do
you
wan
na
live
forever
but
mannheim
had
mentioned
it
aloud
to
the
executive
council
nor
had
he
pointed
out
that
ten
thousand
times
as
many
people
had
died
during
the
same
period
through
preventable
accidents
that
would
not
have
had
the
effect
he
wanted
these
particular
men
had
died
for
this
particular
purpose
they
had
not
asked
to
die
they
had
not
known
they
were
being
sacrificed
none
of
them
could
be
said
to
have
died
a
hero
death
they
had
died
simply
because
they
were
in
a
particular
place
at
a
particular
time
they
had
been
allowed
to
die
for
a
specific
purpose
to
abort
that
purpose
at
this
time
would
be
to
make
their
deaths
retroactively
murder
mannheim
put
his
head
on
the
pillow
and
lifted
his
feet
up
on
the
bed
all
he
wanted
was
a
few
minutes
of
relaxation
he
get
ready
for
sleep
later
he
pressed
the
control
button
on
the
bedframe
that
lifted
the
head
of
the
bed
up
so
that
he
was
in
a
position
he
picked
up
his
drink
and
took
a
second
long
pull
from
it
then
he
touched
the
phone
switch
and
put
the
receiver
to
his
ear
he
said
when
he
heard
the
tone
he
heard
the
hum
and
he
knew
that
the
ultraprivate
phone
on
the
desk
of
farnsworth
in
louis
was
signaling
then
farnsworth
voice
came
over
the
linkage
here
here
mannheim
replied
then
he
asked
guardedly
any
sign
of
our
boy
none
keep
on
him
mannheim
said
let
me
know
immediately
will
do
any
further
no
carry
on
mannheim
cut
off
the
phone
where
the
hell
had
stanton
disappeared
to
and
why
he
had
wanted
to
bring
the
young
man
to
government
city
to
show
him
off
before
the
executives
it
would
have
helped
but
stanton
had
disappeared
mannheim
was
well
aware
that
stanton
had
been
in
the
habit
of
leaving
the
institute
for
long
walks
during
the
evenings
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
gone
for
hours
and
even
yoritomo
that
master
psychologist
had
been
unable
to
give
any
solid
reason
for
stanton
disappearance
you
must
remember
my
dear
colonel
yoritomo
had
said
our
young
stanton
is
a
great
deal
more
complex
in
his
thinking
than
is
our
friend
the
nipe
hell
of
a
job
for
a
police
mannheim
thought
to
himself
know
where
the
criminal
is
but
i
have
to
hunt
for
the
only
cop
on
earth
who
can
arrest
he
drained
his
glass
put
it
on
the
nightstand
and
closed
his
eyes
to
think
an
operator
on
duty
at
the
spy
screens
that
watched
every
move
of
the
nipe
while
he
was
in
the
tunnels
underneath
government
city
thumbed
down
a
switch
and
said
all
stations
alert
subject
is
moving
southward
toward
exit
carrying
raiding
equipment
it
was
all
that
was
necessary
the
nipe
could
not
be
followed
after
he
left
his
lair
but
the
proper
groups
would
be
standing
by
somewhere
the
nipe
would
hit
and
raid
again
somewhere
there
were
human
lives
in
danger
all
anyone
could
do
was
wait
cautiously
and
carefully
the
nipe
lifted
his
head
out
of
the
cool
salt
water
of
the
hudson
river
near
the
point
where
it
widened
into
new
york
harbor
still
so
called
after
the
city
that
had
been
the
greatest
on
the
north
american
continent
before
the
violence
of
a
sun
bomb
had
demolished
it
forever
he
looked
around
carefully
to
get
his
bearings
then
submerged
again
the
opening
into
the
ancient
sewer
was
nearby
once
into
that
network
he
would
know
exactly
where
he
was
heading
it
had
taken
weeks
to
find
his
way
around
within
the
unexplored
maze
of
the
old
sewers
and
he
had
been
uncertain
whether
they
would
lead
him
to
the
place
he
intended
to
visit
but
luck
had
been
with
him
now
he
knew
exactly
where
he
wanted
to
go
and
exactly
what
he
would
find
there
he
had
avoided
government
city
itself
since
his
first
appearance
there
shortly
after
his
arrival
just
as
he
had
as
much
as
possible
avoided
ever
striking
in
the
same
place
more
than
once
but
now
that
it
had
become
necessary
he
went
about
his
work
with
the
same
cool
determination
that
had
always
marked
his
activities
he
knew
his
destination
too
he
knew
the
two
rooms
thoroughly
having
explored
them
carefully
and
gone
away
undetected
and
now
that
he
knew
the
one
he
sought
was
in
those
rooms
he
was
ready
to
make
his
final
investigation
of
the
man
he
swam
on
through
the
utter
blackness
of
the
brackish
water
until
his
head
broke
surface
again
then
he
went
on
along
the
great
conduits
that
were
above
the
level
of
the
sea
captain
davidson
greer
sat
in
the
gun
tower
that
overlooked
the
officers
barracks
and
the
courtyard
surrounding
the
building
he
was
a
tall
solidly
built
man
in
his
early
thirties
with
dark
eyes
and
dark
blond
hair
he
did
particularly
care
for
duty
but
this
sort
of
thing
could
be
left
to
anyone
who
was
not
in
on
the
secret
of
the
nipe
as
long
as
colonel
mannheim
was
here
in
government
city
there
would
be
special
officers
guarding
him
instead
of
the
usual
guard
contingent
not
that
captain
greer
was
actually
expecting
the
nipe
to
make
any
attempt
on
the
colonel
life
that
was
too
remote
to
be
worried
about
but
the
gun
towers
had
been
erected
fifty
or
more
years
before
because
there
were
always
those
who
wanted
to
attempt
assassination
officers
of
the
world
police
had
not
enjoyed
great
popularity
during
the
reconstruction
period
after
the
holocaust
the
petty
potentates
who
had
set
themselves
up
as
autocratic
rulers
in
various
spots
over
the
earth
had
quite
often
decided
that
the
best
way
to
get
the
wp
off
their
backs
was
to
kill
someone
and
quite
often
that
someone
was
a
police
officer
disgruntled
nationalists
and
fanatics
of
all
kinds
had
tried
at
various
times
to
kill
one
officer
or
another
the
protection
was
needed
then
even
now
there
were
occasional
assassins
who
attempted
to
invade
world
police
headquarters
but
they
were
usually
stopped
long
before
they
got
into
the
enclosure
itself
still
there
was
always
the
chance
there
had
been
in
the
past
few
years
an
undercurrent
of
rebellion
all
over
earth
because
of
the
nipe
the
monster
had
been
killed
and
there
were
those
who
screamed
that
the
failure
was
due
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
police
one
attempt
had
already
been
made
on
the
life
of
a
major
thorensen
because
he
had
failed
to
get
the
nipe
after
a
raid
in
leopoldville
the
assassin
had
been
cut
down
just
before
he
threw
a
grenade
that
would
have
killed
half
a
dozen
men
captain
greer
had
been
assigned
to
make
sure
that
no
such
attempt
would
succeed
with
colonel
mannheim
he
could
see
the
length
of
the
hallway
that
led
to
colonel
suite
the
hallway
had
been
purposely
designed
for
watching
from
the
gun
tower
to
one
who
was
inside
it
looked
like
an
ordinary
hallway
stretching
down
the
length
of
the
building
but
it
was
walled
with
a
special
plastic
that
while
opaque
to
visible
light
was
perfectly
transparent
to
to
the
ordinary
unaided
eye
the
walls
of
the
building
presented
a
blank
face
to
the
gun
tower
but
to
the
eye
of
an
scope
the
hallways
of
all
five
floors
looked
as
though
they
were
long
terraces
and
those
walls
were
neither
the
of
the
main
building
nor
the
pressure
glass
of
the
windows
but
ordinary
plastic
to
the
bullets
that
could
be
spewed
forth
from
the
muzzle
of
the
machine
gun
in
the
tower
those
walls
were
practically
nonexistent
captain
greer
surveyed
the
hallways
with
his
binoculars
nothing
the
halls
were
empty
he
lowered
the
binoculars
and
lit
a
cigarette
then
he
put
his
eyes
to
the
aiming
scope
of
the
gun
and
swiveled
the
muzzle
a
little
the
aiming
scope
showed
nothing
either
he
leaned
back
and
exhaled
a
cloud
of
smoke
colonel
mannheim
blinked
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
it
took
him
a
minute
to
himself
then
he
grinned
rather
sheepishly
realizing
that
he
had
dozed
off
with
his
clothes
on
even
worse
the
pressure
at
his
hip
told
him
that
he
had
even
bothered
to
take
his
sidearm
off
he
sat
up
and
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
then
glanced
at
his
wrist
three
in
the
morning
the
moral
of
that
my
dear
he
told
himself
that
a
tired
man
should
put
on
his
pajamas
first
before
he
lies
down
and
drinks
a
he
stood
up
might
as
well
put
his
pajamas
on
and
get
to
bed
he
would
have
to
be
back
in
louis
by
ten
in
the
morning
so
he
ought
to
get
as
much
sleep
as
possible
the
phone
chimed
he
scooped
it
up
and
became
instantly
awake
as
he
heard
the
voice
of
captain
greer
from
the
gun
tower
that
faced
the
outer
wall
colonel
the
nipe
is
just
outside
the
wall
of
your
apartment
in
the
hallway
i
have
him
in
my
sights
he
was
trying
to
stay
calm
mannheim
could
tell
by
his
voice
but
he
rattled
the
words
off
with
rapidity
mannheim
thought
rapidly
whatever
the
nipe
was
up
to
it
include
planting
a
bomb
or
anything
that
might
kill
anyone
accidentally
if
there
was
a
life
in
danger
it
was
his
own
and
the
danger
would
come
from
the
nipe
hands
not
from
any
device
or
weapon
he
was
thankful
that
it
was
captain
greer
up
in
that
tower
not
an
ordinary
guard
who
would
have
fired
the
instant
he
saw
the
alien
through
the
walls
even
so
he
knew
that
the
fingers
must
be
tightening
on
those
triggers
no
human
being
could
do
otherwise
with
that
monster
in
his
sights
mannheim
spoke
very
calmly
and
deliberately
captain
listen
very
carefully
do
i
repeat
do
under
any
circumstances
whatever
fire
that
gun
understand
yes
sir
what
he
doing
i
ca
tell
sir
he
has
some
sort
of
gadget
in
his
hands
but
he
just
seems
to
be
squatting
there
at
the
door
no
to
the
left
of
it
at
the
wall
you
have
your
cameras
going
yes
sir
all
right
get
everything
that
happens
under
no
circumstances
shoot
or
give
the
alarm
if
he
kills
let
him
go
i
do
think
that
will
happen
but
if
it
does
let
him
go
i
think
i
can
talk
to
him
i
do
think
there
much
danger
i
going
to
leave
the
phone
open
so
you
can
record
everything
and
there
was
a
muffled
noise
from
the
living
room
he
heard
captain
gasp
as
he
turned
he
could
see
through
the
bedroom
door
to
the
wall
of
the
living
room
a
large
section
of
the
wall
had
sagged
away
and
collapsed
having
suddenly
lost
its
tensile
strength
on
the
top
of
the
rubble
frozen
for
a
long
instant
stood
the
nipe
watching
with
those
four
glowing
violet
eyes
mannheim
let
go
the
phone
and
turned
to
face
the
monster
and
in
that
instant
he
realized
his
mistake
the
nipe
stared
at
the
human
being
was
this
at
last
a
real
person
it
was
surprising
that
the
man
should
be
awake
only
a
minute
before
the
instruments
had
shown
him
to
be
in
the
odd
cataleptic
state
that
these
creatures
lapsed
into
periodically
similar
to
but
not
identical
with
his
own
rest
state
and
yet
he
was
now
awake
and
fully
dressed
surely
that
indicated
and
then
the
man
turned
and
the
nipe
saw
the
weapon
in
the
holster
at
his
waist
there
was
a
blinding
instant
of
despair
as
he
realized
that
his
hopes
had
been
shattered
and
then
he
launched
himself
across
the
room
colonel
mannheim
hand
darted
toward
the
gun
at
his
hip
it
was
purely
reflex
action
even
as
he
did
it
he
was
aware
that
he
would
never
get
the
weapon
out
in
time
to
bring
it
to
bear
on
the
onrushing
monster
and
he
was
content
that
it
should
be
so
minutes
later
the
nipe
after
carefully
licking
off
the
fingers
of
his
first
pair
of
hands
went
back
into
the
hallway
and
headed
down
toward
the
sewers
again
the
emotion
he
felt
is
inexpressible
in
human
terms
although
he
had
not
wished
to
kill
the
man
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
nipe
felt
contrition
although
he
had
had
no
desire
to
harm
the
family
if
any
of
the
late
colonel
mannheim
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
nipe
felt
sadness
or
compassion
nor
again
although
his
stomachs
churned
and
his
body
felt
sluggish
and
heavy
can
it
be
said
that
he
felt
any
regret
for
what
he
had
done
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
felt
emotion
he
did
his
emotions
were
as
strong
and
as
deep
as
those
of
a
very
sensitive
human
being
his
emotions
could
bring
him
pain
and
they
could
bring
him
pleasure
they
could
crush
him
or
exalt
him
his
emotions
were
just
as
real
and
as
effective
as
any
human
emotions
but
they
were
human
emotions
they
were
emotions
but
not
emotions
it
is
impossible
to
render
into
any
human
terms
the
simple
statement
the
nipe
felt
that
he
had
properly
rendered
homage
to
a
validly
slain
foe
that
can
not
even
begin
to
indicate
the
emotion
the
nipe
felt
as
he
moved
down
toward
the
sewer
and
escape
captain
davidson
greer
his
eyes
staring
with
glassy
hatred
through
the
gunsight
was
registering
a
very
human
emotion
his
trigger
fingers
were
twitching
spasmodically
squeezing
squeezing
squeezing
but
his
fingers
were
not
on
the
triggers
it
is
not
your
fault
bart
said
george
yoritomo
softly
you
had
a
perfect
right
to
go
bart
stanton
clenched
his
fists
and
turned
suddenly
to
face
the
japanese
psychologist
sure
hell
yes
we
not
discussing
my
george
we
discussing
my
criminal
stupidity
i
had
the
right
to
leave
here
any
time
i
wanted
to
sure
but
i
did
have
the
right
to
exercise
that
right
if
that
makes
any
sense
to
you
it
makes
sense
yoritomo
agreed
but
it
is
not
the
way
to
look
at
it
you
could
not
have
been
with
the
colonel
every
minute
of
every
day
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
of
course
not
stanton
cut
in
angrily
but
i
should
have
been
there
time
he
wanted
me
there
and
i
was
gone
if
i
been
there
be
alive
at
this
moment
possibly
yoritomo
said
and
then
again
possibly
not
sit
down
over
there
on
your
bed
my
young
friend
and
listen
to
me
sit
that
it
take
a
deep
breath
hold
it
and
relax
i
want
your
ears
functioning
when
i
talk
to
you
that
better
now
i
do
not
know
where
you
went
that
is
your
business
all
you
i
went
to
denver
stanton
said
and
you
found
nothing
stanton
said
absolutely
nothing
what
were
you
looking
for
i
do
know
something
about
my
past
something
about
myself
i
know
ah
you
went
to
look
up
your
family
you
were
trying
to
fill
the
holes
in
your
memory
eh
yes
and
you
did
not
succeed
no
no
there
was
anything
there
that
i
did
remember
in
general
i
mean
i
found
the
files
in
the
bureau
of
statistics
i
know
how
my
father
died
now
and
how
my
mother
died
and
what
happened
to
my
brother
but
all
that
did
tell
me
anything
i
still
looking
for
something
and
i
do
know
what
it
is
i
was
stupid
to
have
gone
i
suppose
i
should
have
asked
you
or
farnsworth
or
the
colonel
but
you
thought
we
would
answer
yoritomo
said
i
guess
that
about
it
i
should
have
asked
you
yoritomo
shook
his
head
not
necessarily
it
was
actually
better
that
you
looked
for
yourself
besides
we
could
not
have
given
you
any
answer
if
you
yourself
do
not
know
the
question
we
still
ca
i
have
a
feeling
stanton
said
that
you
know
the
question
as
well
as
the
answer
perhaps
perhaps
not
but
there
are
some
things
that
every
man
must
find
out
for
himself
you
were
right
to
do
as
you
did
if
you
had
asked
colonel
mannheim
for
permission
he
would
have
let
you
go
he
would
not
have
asked
you
to
go
to
government
city
with
him
we
that
the
whole
damned
trouble
stanton
snapped
i
the
star
boarder
around
here
the
indispensable
man
so
i
babied
and
coddled
and
when
i
goof
off
i
patted
on
the
back
and
just
how
did
you
goof
off
yoritomo
asked
i
should
have
been
here
ready
to
go
with
the
colonel
very
well
suppose
you
had
gone
do
you
think
you
could
have
saved
his
life
he
could
have
saved
his
own
life
if
he
wanted
to
instead
he
specifically
ordered
the
guard
not
to
shoot
under
any
circumstances
if
you
had
been
there
the
results
would
have
been
the
same
he
would
have
forbidden
you
to
do
anything
at
all
the
time
is
not
yet
ripe
for
you
to
face
the
nipe
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
protect
him
without
disobeying
his
orders
i
might
have
done
just
that
said
stanton
yoritomo
was
suddenly
angry
then
it
is
better
that
you
were
in
denver
young
fool
colonel
walther
mannheim
believed
that
no
single
human
life
is
worth
the
loss
of
the
knowledge
in
that
alien
mind
he
proved
that
by
sacrificing
his
own
life
when
that
became
necessary
i
like
to
think
that
i
would
have
done
the
same
thing
myself
i
am
certain
farnsworth
would
we
would
rather
be
dead
than
allow
that
fund
of
data
to
be
lost
to
the
rest
of
humanity
but
but
who
will
carry
on
with
him
dead
stanton
asked
he
was
the
one
who
everything
you
and
farnsworth
are
cut
out
for
that
sort
of
thing
nor
am
i
no
yoritomo
said
but
that
has
already
been
taken
care
of
mannheim
had
a
replacement
ready
a
message
is
being
sent
out
in
mannheim
name
since
we
are
keeping
the
colonel
death
secret
for
the
time
being
are
the
only
indispensable
man
stanton
the
rest
of
us
can
easily
be
replaced
the
lives
of
dozens
of
human
beings
have
been
sacrificed
five
years
of
your
own
life
have
been
sacrificed
to
put
you
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
the
job
you
are
to
do
does
not
and
never
has
included
acting
as
bodyguard
for
colonel
mannheim
or
anyone
else
understand
stanton
nodded
slowly
i
understand
george
i
understand
the
detective
pushed
his
way
out
of
the
crowded
courtroom
before
the
rest
of
the
crowd
started
to
move
the
members
of
the
jury
were
still
filing
in
and
he
knew
that
no
one
else
would
leave
the
room
until
the
verdict
was
in
he
did
care
he
knew
what
the
verdict
ought
to
be
he
knew
also
that
juries
had
occasionally
been
swayed
by
histrionics
on
the
part
of
the
defense
counsel
and
had
been
persuaded
to
free
guilty
men
he
knew
too
that
prosecutors
had
railroaded
innocent
men
but
such
things
as
that
did
happen
often
in
the
belt
a
man
does
live
too
long
in
the
belt
unless
he
capable
of
recognizing
truth
when
he
sees
it
but
even
if
the
wrong
verdict
had
been
brought
in
there
would
have
been
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
now
he
had
done
his
part
he
had
done
everything
he
could
he
had
brought
them
in
he
had
testified
all
the
rest
of
it
was
up
to
the
jury
and
the
court
those
two
enigmatic
halves
of
justice
and
judgment
the
point
was
that
this
was
the
perfect
time
to
leave
the
courtroom
when
he
reached
his
office
he
could
if
he
wanted
and
he
thought
ruefully
he
probably
want
to
in
spite
of
his
pretended
indifference
call
up
to
find
out
what
the
verdict
had
been
but
during
these
few
moments
all
eyes
were
on
the
jury
box
no
one
was
watching
who
left
quietly
by
the
side
door
of
the
big
courtroom
he
moved
silently
and
with
assurance
in
the
field
of
the
planetoid
one
of
the
uniformed
guards
looked
at
him
and
smiled
throwing
him
an
informal
salute
the
detective
returned
both
if
any
of
those
news
reporters
ask
which
way
i
went
he
said
amiably
tell
i
went
thataway
he
gestured
over
his
shoulder
with
a
thumb
i
ai
even
seen
you
martin
said
the
guard
the
detective
waved
his
thanks
and
kept
going
it
was
that
he
disliked
newsmen
most
of
them
were
fairly
intelligent
pleasant
people
but
he
did
want
to
be
asked
any
questions
right
now
he
had
given
them
interviews
aplenty
during
the
trial
and
they
could
use
those
now
that
the
end
of
the
trial
had
lifted
the
news
ban
they
had
plenty
of
quotations
from
stan
martin
without
asking
him
what
he
thought
of
the
verdict
itself
ten
minutes
later
he
was
in
his
own
office
in
the
lloyd
area
helen
his
secretary
was
just
cutting
off
the
phone
as
he
walked
into
the
outer
office
she
flashed
him
a
big
smile
they
just
gave
the
verdict
martin
guilty
all
the
way
down
the
line
conspiracy
extortion
kidnapping
and
all
the
others
the
only
guilty
verdict
was
a
minor
one
they
decided
that
hedgepeth
involved
in
the
actual
kidnapping
itself
and
therefore
was
guilty
of
the
physical
assault
of
the
guard
they
probably
right
the
detective
said
but
as
you
said
it
a
minor
point
it
does
much
matter
whether
he
was
physically
present
at
the
time
the
boy
was
taken
or
not
he
was
certainly
in
on
the
plot
he
paused
frowning
that
over
and
done
with
except
for
a
possible
appeal
and
it
unlikely
that
that
would
involve
us
anyway
get
pelham
on
the
phone
will
you
i
take
it
in
my
office
the
case
she
asked
yeah
there
something
fishy
about
the
wreck
of
the
spaceship
and
i
want
pelham
to
let
me
work
on
it
he
went
on
into
his
office
and
had
barely
sat
down
when
the
phone
hummed
yes
he
said
depressing
the
switch
benchaim
would
like
to
speak
to
you
sir
helen
said
formally
oh
in
order
to
have
gotten
here
so
quickly
benchaim
too
must
have
left
before
the
verdict
was
delivered
he
was
hardly
more
than
a
minute
behind
the
detective
and
that
was
unusual
in
a
man
who
was
waiting
at
the
trial
of
the
kidnappers
of
his
own
son
still
moishe
benchaim
was
an
unusual
man
tell
him
to
come
right
on
in
the
detective
said
oh
and
helen
hold
off
on
that
pelham
call
for
a
little
while
he
did
want
to
be
talking
business
while
benchaim
was
in
the
office
yes
sir
she
said
a
few
seconds
later
the
door
opened
and
moishe
benchaim
came
in
he
was
not
a
big
man
but
he
was
broad
of
shoulder
and
broad
of
girth
built
like
a
wrestler
he
had
a
heavy
graying
beard
and
wore
it
with
a
patriarchal
air
he
was
breathing
rather
heavily
as
he
came
through
the
door
and
he
stopped
suddenly
to
pull
a
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
he
began
coughing
harsh
racking
painful
coughs
that
shook
his
heavy
frame
sorry
he
said
after
a
moment
damn
lungs
should
try
to
move
so
fast
he
wiped
his
lips
and
put
the
handkerchief
away
the
detective
did
say
anything
he
knew
that
moishe
benchaim
had
injured
his
lungs
eighteen
years
before
an
accident
in
space
had
ruptured
his
spacesuit
and
the
explosive
decompression
that
had
resulted
had
almost
killed
him
he
had
saved
his
own
life
by
holding
the
torn
spot
with
one
hand
and
turning
up
the
valve
full
blast
with
the
other
the
rough
patch
job
had
held
long
enough
for
him
to
get
back
inside
his
ship
but
his
lungs
had
never
been
the
same
and
his
eyes
were
eternally
bloodshot
from
the
ruptured
and
distended
capillaries
i
noticed
you
slipped
out
of
the
courtroom
he
went
on
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
following
you
of
course
not
benchaim
the
detective
said
sit
down
benchaim
sat
in
the
chair
across
the
desk
from
the
detective
i
wait
for
the
verdict
he
said
i
knew
the
conviction
was
certain
after
you
testified
thanks
my
secretary
got
the
news
just
before
you
came
in
guilty
straight
across
the
board
but
your
son
testimony
was
a
lot
more
telling
than
mine
guilty
benchaim
repeated
with
satisfaction
naturally
what
else
i
admit
my
son
testimony
was
good
he
continued
little
shmuela
told
his
story
like
a
little
man
up
there
in
the
never
looked
scared
never
got
mixed
up
but
shmuela
testimony
was
your
testimony
too
martin
if
it
had
been
for
you
he
would
be
here
to
testify
for
which
i
grateful
to
god
then
he
leaned
back
and
spread
his
hands
apart
in
a
gesture
of
dismissal
but
that
all
over
and
done
with
he
said
i
came
about
a
different
matter
again
he
paused
as
if
picking
his
words
carefully
do
you
know
a
man
named
barnabas
nguma
nguma
yes
i
met
him
once
why
he
was
in
the
courtroom
today
he
came
to
see
me
just
before
court
convened
oh
the
detective
said
noncommittally
yes
he
claims
to
represent
an
organization
on
earth
which
has
been
trying
to
hire
you
for
a
job
there
is
that
right
that
right
the
detective
said
warily
what
did
he
want
with
you
now
that
a
funny
thing
benchaim
said
it
seems
that
he
under
the
impression
that
you
turned
down
his
job
to
take
on
this
kidnapping
is
that
right
not
exactly
the
detective
said
tightly
i
was
working
on
your
case
before
he
and
a
couple
of
other
men
came
out
here
to
talk
to
me
but
they
written
to
me
long
before
that
he
wondered
what
benchaim
was
getting
at
he
did
owe
any
explanations
to
the
industrialist
but
on
the
other
hand
he
could
be
impolite
to
him
i
see
benchaim
said
nodding
his
head
slowly
like
most
earthies
nguma
is
suffering
under
a
misapprehension
he
seems
to
think
that
i
have
some
sort
of
hold
over
you
that
i
was
the
one
who
made
you
turn
down
his
job
so
that
you
take
case
oh
was
he
angry
because
you
put
your
own
selfish
interests
ahead
of
his
unselfish
ones
the
detective
asked
with
a
trace
of
hard
sarcasm
in
his
voice
oh
no
said
benchaim
oh
no
not
at
all
he
said
he
understood
perfectly
but
he
wondered
if
now
that
my
boy
had
been
returned
safely
i
might
not
put
a
little
pressure
on
you
to
get
you
to
take
his
case
and
what
did
you
say
moishe
benchaim
scowled
i
told
him
exactly
where
he
could
head
in
i
told
him
that
i
had
no
power
over
you
whatever
that
i
had
hired
you
at
all
that
i
did
even
know
that
you
were
working
on
the
case
until
after
you
rescued
shmuel
i
told
him
that
even
if
i
held
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
you
i
would
never
lift
so
much
as
a
finger
against
you
i
told
him
that
it
was
just
the
other
way
around
in
fact
i
told
him
that
you
have
such
a
power
over
me
because
of
what
you
did
for
shmuel
that
it
is
who
will
jump
through
hoop
if
ordered
not
the
other
way
around
i
was
quite
angry
benchaim
relaxed
a
little
before
going
on
actually
i
sorry
i
blew
up
he
a
man
i
think
no
doubt
the
detective
said
did
he
tell
you
what
the
job
was
with
most
particulars
said
benchaim
i
was
told
all
about
how
this
nipe
has
been
killing
and
eating
people
as
if
i
know
already
but
it
was
until
i
heard
him
talk
that
i
realized
how
scared
people
are
back
there
on
earth
you
know
martin
we
insulated
out
here
we
do
feel
that
terror
even
when
we
read
about
it
or
see
the
reports
on
the
newscasts
if
everybody
on
earth
is
as
scared
as
that
nguma
is
it
a
wonder
they
have
all
panicked
and
taken
to
running
around
in
circles
as
a
matter
of
fact
benchaim
the
detective
said
levelly
they
have
begun
to
do
just
that
nguma
and
his
friends
have
been
after
me
for
a
long
time
to
take
their
job
they
have
pulled
every
trick
they
can
think
of
including
this
last
one
with
you
to
get
me
to
go
back
to
earth
and
find
that
monster
i
have
refused
them
so
often
and
so
firmly
that
they
are
convinced
i
afraid
to
tackle
the
nipe
they
are
convinced
that
i
know
i
fail
and
yet
they
keep
after
me
if
that
is
running
around
in
circles
it
do
until
a
better
example
comes
along
they
out
of
their
minds
benchaim
said
flatly
of
no
man
in
his
right
mind
would
try
to
face
down
that
thing
it
would
be
as
silly
as
trying
to
outrun
a
bullet
or
do
arithmetic
faster
than
a
computer
that
common
sense
that
showing
a
healthy
respect
for
the
nipe
not
fear
at
least
not
fear
in
the
way
that
those
men
are
afraid
suddenly
the
detective
knew
why
the
industrialist
had
come
he
knew
that
moishe
benchaim
wanted
to
reassure
stanley
martin
to
tell
him
that
he
was
doing
the
sensible
thing
in
turning
down
so
dangerous
an
assignment
he
could
almost
have
predicted
word
for
word
what
benchaim
was
going
to
say
next
nguma
may
be
here
at
any
minute
said
the
industrialist
he
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
come
as
soon
as
the
trial
was
over
what
are
you
going
to
tell
him
this
time
i
know
it
none
of
my
business
but
asking
just
the
same
i
going
to
tell
him
the
detective
said
i
will
not
return
to
earth
for
any
reason
whatever
good
said
benchaim
good
that
the
smart
thing
to
do
and
let
him
buffalo
you
we
know
you
out
here
in
the
belt
martin
i
been
out
here
for
thirty
years
and
i
know
what
kind
of
guts
it
takes
to
do
the
things
you
done
those
men
do
understand
space
nobody
understands
space
until
he
lived
in
it
and
worked
in
it
and
had
cold
death
only
a
fraction
of
an
inch
away
from
his
skin
for
hours
and
days
at
a
time
no
matter
what
those
earthies
say
we
know
you
got
more
guts
than
anybody
else
in
the
belt
to
say
nothing
of
those
on
earth
thank
you
i
appreciate
that
the
detective
said
but
they
were
only
words
he
knew
that
benchaim
meant
exactly
what
he
said
or
thought
he
meant
it
but
he
also
knew
that
benchaim
and
others
would
always
wonder
why
he
had
turned
the
job
down
he
thought
wish
i
knew
the
thought
was
only
momentary
then
as
it
had
done
so
many
times
before
his
mind
veered
away
from
the
dangerous
subject
moishe
benchaim
stood
up
well
that
all
i
had
to
say
martin
i
just
wanted
to
warn
you
that
that
man
might
be
coming
around
and
to
tell
you
how
i
felt
remember
what
i
said
about
jumping
through
a
hoop
any
time
you
need
me
for
anything
at
all
you
just
say
so
understand
i
understand
the
detective
said
forcing
a
smile
he
rose
and
shook
the
industrialist
outstretched
hand
and
thanks
again
he
added
after
benchaim
had
gone
the
detective
sat
thinking
toying
with
a
pencil
on
his
desk
moishe
benchaim
like
so
many
others
in
the
belt
had
come
out
with
nothing
but
his
brain
and
his
two
hands
and
the
equipment
necessary
to
keep
him
alive
in
thirty
years
he
had
parlayed
that
into
one
of
the
biggest
fortunes
in
the
solar
system
it
was
men
like
that
whose
respect
he
valued
and
on
the
surface
he
apparently
had
that
respect
but
refusing
the
nipe
job
would
dull
the
bright
sheen
of
that
respect
and
he
knew
it
benchaim
had
talked
about
how
foolish
it
would
be
to
try
to
beat
the
nipe
in
a
encounter
but
he
had
meant
it
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
all
stanley
martin
would
be
expected
to
do
would
be
to
find
out
where
the
nipe
hideout
was
once
that
had
been
accomplished
men
and
machines
most
especially
machines
could
wipe
the
monster
from
the
face
of
the
earth
one
bomb
would
do
it
if
the
authorities
only
knew
where
to
place
that
bomb
if
only
again
his
mind
veered
away
refusing
to
consider
the
nipe
too
carefully
or
too
closely
the
intercom
on
his
desk
hummed
and
he
pressed
the
switch
yes
helen
that
nguma
was
here
while
benchaim
was
with
you
martin
i
followed
your
instructions
and
told
him
that
you
would
not
see
him
fine
thanks
helen
also
there
a
radiogram
for
you
from
earth
if
it
from
one
of
nguma
colleagues
the
detective
said
i
want
to
see
it
file
it
in
the
cylindrical
file
under
i
do
think
it
is
the
secretary
said
doubtfully
i
ca
make
any
sense
out
of
it
i
better
bring
it
in
okay
and
then
put
that
call
through
to
pelham
i
want
to
get
going
on
that
spaceship
wrecking
i
getting
itchy
for
action
she
brought
in
the
radiogram
and
put
it
on
his
desk
before
calling
pelham
she
had
already
read
it
of
course
it
was
her
job
to
read
such
things
the
detective
picked
up
the
sheet
of
paper
and
read
it
the
operation
is
about
to
begin
i
need
the
other
half
of
my
forceps
come
home
and
join
the
big
parade
mannheim
it
took
a
second
for
the
words
to
really
impress
themselves
on
his
mind
he
read
them
over
again
and
the
veil
began
to
drop
from
the
part
of
his
mind
memories
began
to
swarm
back
into
his
mind
memories
that
had
been
walled
off
and
kept
away
from
his
conscious
mind
by
the
hypnotic
suggestion
implanted
so
long
ago
oddly
it
did
not
surprise
or
shock
him
he
was
an
expert
at
hypnosis
especially
he
recognized
the
message
for
exactly
what
it
was
a
series
of
code
phrases
designed
to
break
the
blockage
that
had
been
placed
in
his
mind
his
only
reaction
was
to
laugh
aloud
by
god
he
said
it
worked
it
actually
worked
nearly
six
years
and
i
never
suspected
once
the
phone
hummed
he
switched
it
on
pelham
is
on
the
phone
martin
helen
said
he
watched
as
the
florid
smiling
face
of
pelham
his
superior
appeared
on
the
screen
what
can
i
do
for
you
martin
he
asked
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
mr
pelham
anything
within
reason
pelham
said
after
this
benchaim
affair
you
in
good
standing
around
here
he
chuckled
i
want
a
leave
of
absence
the
detective
said
pelham
looked
a
little
surprised
well
i
guess
you
deserve
it
you
need
a
rest
i
imagine
no
the
detective
said
no
it
is
that
i
going
after
bigger
game
is
all
what
that
i
going
to
earth
to
find
the
nipe
from
the
very
moment
he
had
heard
that
stanley
martin
had
arrived
to
take
charge
of
the
project
bart
stanton
pushed
all
thoughts
of
his
brother
out
of
his
mind
he
had
fouled
up
once
by
thinking
of
himself
rather
than
thinking
of
what
had
to
be
done
he
would
not
make
that
mistake
again
nor
apparently
did
martin
have
any
desire
to
meet
bart
stanton
he
took
control
of
the
project
smoothly
apparently
mannheim
had
taken
into
account
the
possibility
of
his
own
death
and
had
arranged
things
accordingly
although
martin
was
not
a
member
of
the
world
police
his
own
record
showed
that
he
had
the
ability
to
handle
the
job
and
an
executive
session
had
unanimously
accepted
colonel
mannheim
wishes
in
the
matter
there
was
little
else
they
could
do
the
very
fact
that
mannheim
had
died
in
the
way
he
had
ordering
the
guard
to
hold
his
fire
had
stilled
those
voices
on
the
executive
council
who
had
been
wavering
before
martin
had
come
in
to
earth
almost
secretly
without
fanfare
and
the
general
public
was
totally
unaware
that
anything
at
all
had
happened
special
messages
going
through
the
channels
known
to
be
tapped
by
the
nipe
said
that
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
to
admit
that
the
nipe
could
actually
penetrate
the
defenses
of
world
police
headquarters
so
the
nipe
was
not
surprised
when
the
public
news
channels
announced
quietly
that
colonel
walther
mannheim
the
man
who
had
been
decorated
twelve
years
before
for
the
quelling
of
the
central
brazilian
insurrection
had
died
peacefully
in
his
sleep
the
funeral
was
quiet
but
with
full
honors
stanton
stopped
worrying
about
such
things
until
he
had
done
the
job
that
he
had
been
rebuilt
for
he
was
determined
to
make
that
goal
his
sole
purpose
as
the
weeks
sped
by
he
kept
determinedly
to
his
regime
exercising
regularly
to
keep
himself
in
top
physical
condition
and
studying
the
motion
studies
of
the
nipe
in
action
only
one
of
these
made
him
ill
the
first
time
he
watched
it
but
it
was
the
only
recording
of
the
nipe
actually
in
the
process
of
killing
a
man
so
he
watched
over
and
over
again
the
shots
taken
from
the
gun
tower
when
the
nipe
attacked
colonel
mannheim
a
mockup
of
the
nipe
body
had
been
built
with
the
best
approximation
possible
of
the
nipe
bone
structure
and
musculature
and
stanton
worked
with
it
to
determine
what
if
any
were
the
physical
limitations
his
only
periods
of
relative
relaxation
occurred
when
he
discussed
the
psychological
peculiarities
of
the
nipe
mind
with
george
yoritomo
one
afternoon
after
a
particularly
strenuous
boxing
session
he
walked
into
yoritomo
office
with
a
grin
on
his
face
i
been
considering
the
problem
of
the
apparent
paradox
of
a
high
technology
in
a
system
yoritomo
grinned
back
delightedly
and
waved
stanton
to
a
chair
excellent
it
is
always
much
better
if
the
student
thinks
these
things
out
for
himself
now
while
i
fill
this
with
tobacco
and
fire
up
you
will
please
explain
to
me
all
about
it
stanton
sat
down
and
settled
himself
comfortably
all
right
in
the
first
place
there
the
notion
of
religion
in
tribal
cultures
the
religion
is
usually
uh
animistic
i
think
the
word
is
yoritomo
nodded
silently
they
believe
there
are
spirits
everywhere
stanton
said
that
sort
of
belief
it
seems
to
me
would
grow
up
in
any
race
that
had
imagination
and
the
nipes
must
have
had
plenty
of
that
or
they
would
have
the
technology
that
we
know
they
do
have
am
i
on
the
right
track
very
good
good
yoritomo
said
in
approval
but
what
evidence
have
you
that
this
technology
was
not
given
to
them
by
some
other
more
advanced
race
i
had
thought
of
that
stanton
stared
into
space
for
a
moment
then
nodded
his
head
of
course
it
would
take
too
long
to
teach
them
it
would
be
worth
all
the
trouble
it
would
take
to
make
them
unlearn
their
fallacies
and
learn
the
new
facts
it
would
take
generations
to
do
it
unless
this
hypothetical
other
race
killed
off
all
the
adult
nipes
and
started
the
little
ones
off
fresh
and
that
did
happen
because
if
it
had
the
system
would
have
died
out
too
so
that
theory
is
out
the
argument
is
imperfect
yoritomo
said
but
it
will
suffice
for
the
moment
go
on
about
the
religion
okay
religious
beliefs
are
not
subject
to
pragmatic
tests
that
is
the
spiritual
beliefs
are
any
belief
that
be
disproven
by
such
a
test
would
eventually
die
out
but
beliefs
in
ghosts
or
demons
or
angels
or
life
after
death
are
disprovable
by
material
tests
any
more
than
they
are
provable
so
as
a
race
increases
its
knowledge
of
the
physical
world
its
religion
would
tend
to
become
more
and
more
spiritual
agreed
yes
it
happened
so
among
human
beings
said
yoritomo
but
how
do
you
link
this
fact
with
well
once
a
belief
gains
a
foothold
stanton
said
it
is
very
difficult
to
wipe
it
out
even
among
human
beings
among
nipes
it
would
be
impossible
once
a
code
of
ritual
and
of
social
behavior
had
been
set
up
it
became
permanent
for
example
yoritomo
urged
well
shaking
hands
for
example
stanton
said
after
a
pause
we
still
do
that
even
if
we
do
have
it
fixed
solidly
in
our
heads
that
we
do
it
i
suppose
it
would
never
occur
to
a
nipe
not
to
perform
such
a
ritual
just
so
yoritomo
agreed
vigorously
such
things
once
established
in
the
minds
of
the
race
would
tend
to
remain
but
it
is
a
characteristic
of
a
system
that
it
resists
change
change
is
evil
change
is
wrong
we
must
use
what
we
know
to
be
true
not
try
something
that
has
never
been
tried
before
in
a
system
a
thing
which
is
not
ritual
is
taboo
how
then
can
we
account
for
their
high
technological
achievements
the
pragmatic
engineering
approach
i
imagine
stanton
said
if
a
thing
works
then
go
ahead
and
use
it
it
is
usable
if
not
it
is
approximately
said
yoritomo
but
only
approximately
now
it
is
my
turn
to
lecture
he
put
his
pipe
in
an
ashtray
and
held
up
a
long
bony
finger
firstly
we
must
remember
that
the
nipe
is
equipped
with
a
functioning
imagination
secondly
he
has
in
his
memory
a
tremendous
amount
of
data
all
ready
at
hand
he
is
capable
of
working
out
theories
in
his
head
you
see
like
the
ancient
greeks
he
finds
no
need
to
test
such
theories
his
thinking
indicates
that
such
an
experiment
would
yield
something
useful
unlike
the
greeks
he
has
no
aversion
to
experiment
but
he
sees
no
need
for
useless
experiment
either
oh
he
would
learn
yes
but
once
a
given
theory
proved
workable
how
resistant
he
would
be
to
a
new
theory
innovators
even
in
our
own
culture
have
a
very
hard
time
working
against
the
great
inertia
of
a
recognized
theory
how
much
harder
it
would
be
in
a
society
with
a
perfect
memory
how
long
how
long
it
would
take
such
a
race
to
achieve
the
technology
the
nipe
now
has
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
said
stanton
yoritomo
shook
his
head
briskly
puh
longer
much
longer
he
smiled
with
satisfaction
i
estimate
that
the
nipe
race
first
invented
the
steam
engine
not
less
than
ten
million
years
ago
he
kept
smiling
into
the
dead
silence
that
followed
after
a
long
minute
stanton
said
what
about
atomic
energy
at
least
two
million
years
ago
yoritomo
said
i
do
not
think
they
have
had
the
interstellar
drive
more
than
some
fifty
thousand
years
no
wonder
our
pet
nipe
is
so
patient
stanton
said
with
a
touch
of
awe
in
his
voice
how
long
do
you
suppose
their
individual
is
not
so
long
in
comparison
said
yoritomo
perhaps
no
longer
than
our
own
at
the
least
or
perhaps
as
much
as
five
hundred
years
considering
the
tremendous
handicaps
against
them
they
have
done
quite
well
i
think
quite
well
indeed
for
a
race
of
illiterate
cannibals
how
that
again
stanton
realized
that
the
scientist
was
quite
serious
had
it
occurred
to
you
my
friend
that
they
must
be
cannibals
yoritomo
asked
and
that
they
must
be
very
nearly
illiterate
no
stanton
admitted
it
had
the
nipe
like
man
is
omnivorous
yoritomo
pointed
out
specialization
tends
to
lead
any
race
up
a
blind
alley
and
dietary
restrictions
are
a
particularly
pernicious
form
of
specialization
a
lion
would
starve
to
death
in
a
wheat
field
a
horse
would
perish
in
a
butcher
shop
full
of
steaks
a
man
will
survive
as
long
as
there
is
something
around
to
eat
even
if
it
another
man
yoritomo
picked
up
his
pipe
and
began
tapping
the
ashes
out
of
it
also
he
went
on
we
must
remember
that
man
early
in
his
career
of
becoming
top
dog
on
earth
began
using
a
method
of
removing
the
unfit
ritual
traces
of
it
remain
today
in
some
societies
the
jewish
bar
mitzvah
for
instance
or
the
christian
confirmation
before
and
immediately
after
the
holocaust
there
were
still
primitive
societies
on
earth
in
new
guinea
for
instance
which
still
made
a
rather
hard
ordeal
out
of
the
rite
of
passage
the
ceremony
whereby
a
boy
becomes
a
man
if
he
passes
the
tests
yoritomo
was
filling
his
pipe
a
look
of
somber
satisfaction
on
his
lean
face
a
few
millennia
ago
a
boy
who
underwent
those
tests
was
killed
outright
if
he
failed
and
was
eaten
he
had
not
shown
the
ability
to
overrule
with
reason
his
animal
instincts
therefore
he
was
not
a
human
being
but
an
animal
what
better
use
for
a
young
and
succulent
animal
than
to
provide
meat
for
the
common
larder
and
you
think
the
same
process
must
have
been
used
by
the
nipes
stanton
asked
yoritomo
nodded
vigorously
as
he
applied
a
match
flame
to
the
tobacco
in
his
pipe
the
nipe
race
must
of
necessity
have
had
some
similar
ritualistic
tests
or
they
would
not
have
become
what
they
are
he
said
when
he
had
puffed
the
pipe
alight
and
we
have
already
agreed
that
once
the
nipes
adopted
something
of
that
kind
it
remained
with
them
not
so
yes
also
it
can
be
considered
extremely
unlikely
that
the
nipe
civilization
if
such
it
can
be
called
has
any
geriatric
problem
no
indeed
no
pensions
no
old
folks
homes
no
senility
no
nor
any
specialists
in
geriatrics
either
when
a
nipe
becomes
a
burden
because
of
age
he
is
ritually
murdered
and
eaten
with
all
due
solemnity
yoritomo
pointed
his
pipestem
at
stanton
ah
you
frown
my
friend
have
i
made
them
sound
heartless
without
the
finer
feelings
of
which
we
humans
are
so
proud
not
so
when
junior
nipe
fails
his
puberty
tests
when
mama
and
papa
nipe
are
sent
to
their
final
reward
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
sadness
in
the
hearts
of
their
loved
ones
as
the
honored
are
passed
around
the
table
he
put
the
pipe
back
in
his
mouth
and
spoke
around
it
my
own
ancestors
not
too
far
back
performed
a
ritual
suicide
by
disemboweling
themselves
with
a
long
sharp
knife
across
the
abdomen
and
up
into
the
heart
it
was
considered
very
bad
form
to
faint
or
die
before
the
job
was
done
nearby
a
relative
or
a
close
friend
stood
with
a
sharp
sword
to
administer
the
de
by
decapitation
it
was
all
very
sad
and
very
honorable
their
loved
ones
bore
the
sorrow
with
great
pride
his
voice
which
had
been
low
and
tender
suddenly
became
very
brisk
thank
goodness
it
has
gone
out
of
fashion
but
how
can
you
be
they
cannibals
stanton
asked
your
argument
sounds
logical
enough
but
you
ca
be
basing
your
theory
on
that
alone
true
true
yoritomo
jabbed
the
air
twice
with
a
rapid
forefinger
evidence
for
such
a
theory
would
be
most
welcome
would
it
not
very
well
i
give
you
the
evidence
he
eats
human
beings
our
nipe
that
does
make
him
a
cannibal
stanton
objected
not
perhaps
but
consider
the
nipe
is
not
a
monster
he
is
not
a
criminal
no
he
is
a
gentleman
he
always
behaves
as
a
gentleman
he
is
shipwrecked
on
an
alien
planet
around
him
he
sees
evidence
in
profusion
that
ours
is
a
technological
society
but
that
is
a
contradiction
a
paradox
for
are
not
civilized
no
we
are
not
rational
we
are
not
sane
we
do
not
obey
the
laws
we
do
not
perform
the
rituals
we
are
animals
apparently
intelligent
animals
but
animals
nevertheless
how
can
this
be
says
the
nipe
to
himself
these
animals
must
be
ruled
over
by
real
people
it
is
the
only
explanation
not
so
colonel
mannheim
mentioned
that
stanton
said
are
you
implying
that
the
nipe
thinks
there
are
other
nipes
around
running
the
world
from
secret
hideouts
like
the
villains
in
a
fu
manchu
novel
not
quite
said
yoritomo
laughing
the
nipe
is
not
at
all
incapable
of
learning
something
new
in
point
of
fact
he
is
quite
good
at
it
as
witness
the
fact
that
he
has
learned
many
earth
languages
he
picked
up
russian
in
less
than
eight
months
simply
by
listening
and
observing
like
our
own
race
his
undoubtedly
evolved
a
great
many
languages
during
the
beginnings
of
its
progress
when
there
were
many
tribes
separated
and
out
of
communication
with
each
other
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
find
that
most
of
these
languages
have
survived
and
that
our
distressed
astronaut
knows
them
all
a
new
language
would
not
bother
him
in
the
least
nor
would
strangely
shaped
intelligent
beings
make
him
unhappy
his
race
should
be
aware
by
now
that
such
things
must
exist
but
it
is
very
likely
that
he
equates
intelligence
with
technology
and
i
do
not
think
it
likely
that
he
has
ever
met
a
race
higher
than
the
barbarian
level
before
such
races
were
not
of
course
human
by
his
definition
they
showed
possibilities
perhaps
but
they
had
not
by
any
means
evolved
far
enough
and
considering
the
time
span
involved
in
their
own
progress
toward
a
technological
civilization
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
the
nipe
thinks
of
technology
as
something
that
evolves
in
a
race
in
the
same
way
that
intelligence
does
or
the
body
itself
so
it
would
not
surprise
him
to
find
that
the
real
people
of
this
system
were
humanoid
in
shape
instead
of
ah
nipoid
a
bad
word
but
it
will
do
for
the
nonce
to
find
real
people
of
a
different
shape
is
something
new
but
he
can
absorb
it
because
it
does
not
contradict
anything
he
any
truly
intelligent
being
that
did
not
obey
the
law
and
follow
the
ritual
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
for
our
nipe
has
no
notion
of
a
real
person
without
those
characteristics
without
those
characteristics
technology
is
of
course
utterly
impossible
since
he
sees
technology
all
around
him
it
follows
that
there
must
be
real
people
around
somewhere
that
have
those
characteristics
anything
else
is
unthinkable
it
seems
to
me
that
you
building
an
awfully
involved
theory
out
of
pretty
flimsy
stuff
stanton
said
yoritomo
shook
his
head
not
at
all
not
at
all
every
scrap
and
shred
of
evidence
we
have
points
toward
it
why
do
you
suppose
does
the
nipe
conscientiously
devour
his
victims
often
risking
his
own
safety
to
do
so
why
do
you
suppose
he
never
uses
any
weapon
but
his
own
hands
to
kill
with
yoritomo
leaned
forward
and
speared
out
at
stanton
with
a
long
bony
forefinger
why
to
tell
the
real
people
that
he
is
a
gentleman
he
sat
back
with
a
satisfied
smile
and
puffed
complacently
at
his
pipe
remaining
silent
while
bart
stanton
considered
his
last
remark
just
one
thing
stanton
said
after
a
minute
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
be
able
to
judge
that
some
races
have
different
laws
and
rituals
than
he
does
would
they
have
a
science
comparable
to
our
anthropology
yoritomo
grinned
nipology
shall
we
say
well
he
might
but
it
would
not
tell
him
what
our
anthropology
tells
us
consider
how
have
we
learned
much
of
our
knowledge
of
the
early
history
of
man
by
the
study
of
cultures
the
cultures
it
is
from
these
tribes
that
we
have
learned
the
multifarious
ways
in
which
a
group
of
human
beings
can
evolve
a
culture
and
a
society
but
does
the
nipe
have
any
such
other
tribes
to
study
why
would
he
stanton
asked
because
there
are
none
yoritomo
said
how
could
there
be
consider
again
once
a
race
has
evolved
a
fairly
high
technological
level
it
is
capable
of
wiping
out
races
which
have
not
achieved
that
level
if
the
technologically
advanced
tribe
is
still
at
the
level
it
will
consider
that
all
tribes
which
do
not
use
the
same
laws
and
rituals
as
it
does
must
be
animals
dangerous
animals
that
must
be
wiped
out
take
a
look
at
the
history
of
our
own
race
in
a
few
short
centuries
we
find
that
the
technologically
advanced
civilization
and
culture
of
renaissance
europe
has
spread
over
the
whole
globe
by
military
economic
and
religious
conquest
it
has
in
effect
westernized
the
majority
of
mankind
the
same
process
would
take
place
on
the
nipe
world
only
more
thoroughly
the
weaker
tribes
would
vanish
the
stronger
would
amalgamate
that
process
would
take
a
lot
of
time
stanton
said
indeed
oh
yes
indeed
yoritomo
agreed
but
they
have
had
the
time
have
they
not
eh
what
western
european
man
has
partially
achieved
in
less
than
a
thousand
years
surely
the
nipe
equivalent
could
have
achieved
in
ten
thousand
thousand
eh
but
i
think
that
the
nipe
would
have
realized
after
ten
years
that
there
is
no
such
race
of
real
people
stanton
said
he
had
access
to
our
records
and
books
and
such
things
or
does
he
reject
them
all
as
lies
possibly
he
would
if
he
could
read
them
yoritomo
said
did
i
not
say
he
was
illiterate
you
mean
he
learned
to
speak
our
languages
but
not
to
read
them
the
psychologist
smiled
broadly
your
statement
is
accurate
my
friend
but
incomplete
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
nipe
is
incapable
of
reading
any
written
language
whatever
the
concept
does
not
exist
in
his
mind
except
vaguely
stanton
closed
one
eye
and
gave
yoritomo
the
glance
askance
aw
come
george
a
technological
race
without
a
written
language
impossible
ah
no
no
it
is
ask
yourself
what
need
has
a
race
with
a
perfect
memory
for
written
records
at
least
in
the
sense
that
we
think
of
them
certainly
not
to
remember
things
what
would
a
nipe
need
with
a
memorandum
book
or
a
diary
all
of
their
history
and
all
of
their
technology
exists
in
the
collective
mind
of
the
race
think
for
a
moment
of
their
history
if
it
is
somewhat
analogous
to
human
history
and
as
we
have
seen
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
so
then
we
can
in
a
way
trace
the
development
of
writing
we
wait
a
minute
stanton
held
up
his
hand
i
think
i
see
what
driving
at
ah
so
yoritomo
nodded
very
well
then
expound
i
can
give
it
to
you
in
two
sentences
stanton
said
one
their
first
writing
was
probably
pictographic
and
was
learned
only
by
a
select
priestly
class
two
it
still
is
ahhhh
yoritomo
eyes
lit
up
admirable
most
admirable
and
succinctly
put
too
and
to
top
it
off
almost
precisely
correct
that
is
what
happened
here
on
earth
are
we
wrong
in
assuming
that
such
may
have
happened
elsewhere
in
the
universe
remembering
always
my
dear
bart
that
we
must
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
like
our
friend
the
nipe
and
assuming
that
everybody
else
in
the
universe
has
to
be
like
us
in
all
things
you
are
correct
that
is
why
i
hedged
when
i
said
he
was
illiterate
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
written
symbology
does
exist
for
nipes
but
it
is
used
almost
entirely
for
ritualistic
purposes
it
is
pictographical
in
form
and
is
known
only
to
a
very
few
for
others
to
learn
it
would
be
taboo
remember
i
said
that
there
is
only
one
society
one
culture
remaining
on
the
nipe
planet
and
remember
that
history
is
a
very
late
development
in
our
own
culture
just
as
written
language
is
one
important
event
in
every
ten
centuries
of
nipe
history
would
still
give
a
nipe
historian
ten
thousand
events
to
remember
just
since
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
what
then
does
nipe
history
become
a
series
of
folk
chants
of
de
why
stanton
asked
if
they
have
perfect
memories
why
would
histories
be
distorted
time
my
dear
boy
time
yoritomo
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
futility
when
one
has
a
few
million
years
of
history
to
learn
it
become
distorted
even
in
a
race
with
a
perfect
memory
otherwise
no
individual
would
have
a
chance
to
learn
it
all
in
a
single
lifetime
even
a
lifetime
of
five
hundred
years
much
less
to
pass
that
knowledge
on
to
another
so
only
the
most
important
events
are
reported
and
that
means
that
each
historian
must
also
be
an
editor
he
must
excise
those
portions
which
he
considers
unimportant
but
would
that
very
limitation
induce
them
to
record
history
stanton
asked
right
there
is
your
inducement
to
use
a
written
language
yoritomo
looked
at
him
with
innocence
why
good
is
history
ohhh
said
stanton
i
see
certainly
you
do
yoritomo
said
firmly
of
what
use
is
history
to
the
culture
only
to
record
what
is
to
be
done
and
with
a
memory
that
can
what
is
to
be
done
of
what
use
is
a
historian
except
to
remember
the
things
no
culture
looks
upon
history
as
we
do
only
the
doings
of
the
great
are
recorded
all
else
must
be
edited
out
thus
while
the
memory
of
the
individual
may
be
and
perfect
the
memory
of
the
race
is
not
they
know
that
what
about
communications
then
stanton
asked
what
did
they
use
before
they
invented
radio
couriers
yoritomo
said
and
possibly
written
messages
from
one
priestly
scribe
to
another
that
last
by
the
way
has
probably
survived
in
a
ritualistic
form
when
an
officer
is
appointed
to
a
post
say
he
may
get
a
formal
paper
that
says
so
the
nipes
may
use
symbols
to
signify
rank
and
so
on
they
must
have
a
symbology
for
the
calibration
of
scientific
instruments
but
none
of
these
requires
the
complexity
of
a
written
language
i
dare
say
our
use
of
it
is
quite
baffling
to
him
for
teaching
purposes
it
is
quite
unnecessary
look
at
what
television
and
such
have
done
in
our
own
civilization
with
such
tools
as
that
at
hand
recordings
and
pictures
it
is
possible
to
teach
a
person
a
great
many
things
without
ever
teaching
him
to
read
a
nipe
certainly
need
any
aid
for
calculation
would
he
we
humans
must
use
a
piece
of
paper
to
multiply
two
numbers
together
but
that
because
our
memories
are
faulty
a
nipe
has
no
need
for
such
aids
are
you
really
positive
of
all
this
george
stanton
asked
yoritomo
shrugged
how
can
we
be
absolutely
positive
at
this
stage
of
the
game
eh
our
evidence
is
sketchy
i
admit
it
is
not
as
solidly
based
as
our
other
reconstructions
of
his
background
but
it
appears
that
he
thinks
of
symbols
as
being
unable
to
convey
much
information
the
pattern
for
his
raids
for
instance
indicates
that
his
knowledge
of
the
materials
he
wants
and
their
locations
comes
from
vocal
sources
television
advertising
eavesdropping
on
shipping
orders
and
so
on
in
other
words
he
cases
the
joint
by
ear
if
he
could
understand
written
information
his
job
would
be
much
easier
he
could
find
his
materials
much
more
quickly
and
easily
and
too
we
have
never
seen
him
either
read
a
word
or
write
one
from
this
evidence
we
are
fairly
certain
that
he
can
neither
read
nor
write
any
terrestrial
language
or
even
his
own
he
spread
his
hands
again
as
i
said
it
is
not
proof
no
stanton
agreed
but
i
must
admit
that
the
whole
thing
makes
for
some
very
interesting
speculation
does
it
very
interesting
indeed
yoritomo
folded
his
hands
in
his
lap
smiled
seraphically
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
in
fact
my
friend
we
are
now
so
positive
of
our
knowledge
of
the
nipe
mind
that
we
are
prepared
to
enter
into
the
next
phase
of
our
program
oh
stanton
distinctly
felt
the
back
of
his
neck
prickle
yes
said
yoritomo
martin
feels
that
if
we
wait
much
longer
we
may
run
into
the
danger
of
giving
the
nipe
enough
time
to
complete
his
work
on
his
communicator
he
looked
at
stanton
and
chuckled
but
there
was
no
humor
in
his
short
laugh
we
would
not
wish
our
friend
the
nipe
to
bring
his
relatives
into
this
little
tussle
would
we
bart
that
been
our
deadline
all
along
bart
said
levelly
the
object
all
along
has
been
to
let
the
nipe
work
without
hindrance
as
long
as
he
did
not
actually
produce
a
communicator
that
would
as
you
put
it
bring
his
relatives
into
the
tussle
have
things
changed
they
have
yoritomo
acknowledged
why
would
they
we
have
been
working
toward
that
as
a
deadline
if
it
appeared
that
the
nipe
were
actually
about
to
contact
his
confederates
out
there
somewhere
we
would
be
forced
to
act
immediately
of
course
plan
beta
would
go
into
effect
but
we
do
want
that
do
we
no
said
stanton
no
he
was
well
aware
what
a
terrible
loss
it
would
be
for
humanity
if
plan
beta
went
into
effect
the
nipe
would
have
to
be
literally
blasted
out
of
his
cozy
little
nest
no
of
course
not
yoritomo
chuckled
again
with
as
little
mirth
as
he
had
before
within
a
very
short
while
if
we
are
correct
we
shall
with
your
help
arrest
the
most
feared
that
earth
has
ever
known
i
dare
say
that
the
public
will
be
extremely
happy
to
hear
of
his
death
and
i
know
that
the
rest
of
us
will
be
happy
to
know
that
he
will
never
kill
again
stanton
suddenly
saw
the
fateful
day
for
which
he
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
and
trained
looming
terrifyingly
large
in
the
immediate
future
how
soon
he
asked
in
an
oddly
choked
voice
within
days
yoritomo
lowered
his
eyes
from
the
ceiling
and
looked
into
stanton
face
with
a
mild
bland
expression
tomorrow
he
said
the
propaganda
phase
begins
we
will
announce
to
the
world
that
the
great
detective
stanley
martin
has
come
to
earth
to
rid
us
of
the
nipe
the
arrival
of
the
great
stanley
martin
was
a
wonder
in
the
public
news
channels
his
previous
exploits
were
recounted
with
embellishments
several
times
during
the
next
hours
the
arrival
itself
was
very
carefully
staged
a
special
ship
belonging
to
the
world
police
brought
him
in
and
he
was
met
by
four
government
officials
in
civilian
clothes
the
entire
affair
was
covered
live
by
news
cameras
no
one
on
earth
suspected
that
he
had
been
on
earth
for
weeks
before
a
few
it
but
it
never
even
occurred
to
the
rest
later
a
special
interview
was
arranged
philip
quinn
a
news
interviewer
who
was
noted
for
his
deferential
attitude
toward
those
whom
he
had
the
privilege
of
interviewing
was
chosen
for
the
job
stanley
martin
dynamic
forceful
personality
completely
overshadowed
quinn
but
in
spite
of
all
the
publicity
not
one
word
not
one
hint
about
the
method
by
which
stanley
martin
intended
to
bring
the
nipe
in
was
released
there
were
all
kinds
of
speculations
ranging
from
the
mystically
sublime
to
the
broadly
comical
one
archbishop
of
a
california
nut
cult
declared
that
martin
was
a
saint
appointed
by
god
to
exorcise
the
demon
nipe
that
had
been
plaguing
mankind
and
that
the
millennium
was
therefore
due
at
any
moment
he
was
he
said
sending
stanley
martin
a
sealed
letter
which
contained
a
special
exorcism
prayer
that
would
do
the
job
very
nicely
why
had
he
used
it
himself
because
if
anyone
other
than
a
saint
or
an
angel
used
it
it
would
backfire
on
the
user
and
destroy
him
naturally
the
archbishop
did
not
claim
himself
to
be
a
saint
but
he
knew
that
martin
was
because
he
had
plainly
seen
the
halo
around
the
detective
head
when
he
saw
him
on
tv
an
inventor
in
palermo
sicily
solemnly
declared
that
he
had
sent
stanley
martin
the
plans
for
a
device
that
would
render
him
invisible
to
the
nipe
and
therefore
make
the
nipe
easy
to
conquer
no
there
was
no
danger
that
the
device
might
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
and
be
used
by
human
criminals
since
it
did
not
render
a
person
invisible
to
human
eyes
only
to
nipe
eyes
the
first
item
was
played
up
big
in
the
newscasts
the
second
was
quashed
fast
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
the
nipe
just
might
have
believed
it
one
note
throbbed
in
the
background
of
every
interview
with
responsible
persons
it
was
the
unobtrusive
note
of
a
soft
clarinet
played
in
a
great
symphony
all
the
more
telling
because
it
was
never
played
loudly
or
insistently
but
it
was
there
all
the
same
whenever
the
question
of
the
nipe
actual
whereabouts
came
up
the
note
seemed
to
ring
a
trifle
more
clearly
but
never
more
loudly
that
single
throbbing
note
was
the
impression
given
by
everyone
who
was
interviewed
or
who
expressed
any
views
on
the
subject
that
the
nipe
was
hiding
somewhere
in
the
amazonian
jungles
of
south
america
it
was
the
last
place
on
earth
that
had
still
not
been
thoroughly
explored
and
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
place
that
the
nipe
could
hide
only
a
small
handful
of
the
vast
array
of
people
who
were
dispensing
this
carefully
tailored
propaganda
knew
what
was
going
on
more
than
percent
of
the
newsmen
involved
in
the
affair
thought
they
were
honestly
giving
the
news
as
they
saw
it
and
none
of
them
saw
the
invisible
but
very
powerful
hand
of
stanley
martin
shifting
the
news
just
enough
to
give
it
the
bias
he
wanted
the
comedians
on
the
entertainment
programs
let
the
whole
story
alone
for
the
most
part
there
were
no
clever
skits
no
farcical
takeoffs
on
the
subject
of
stanley
martin
and
the
nipe
one
comedian
who
was
playing
the
part
of
a
henpecked
husband
did
remark
if
my
wife
gets
any
meaner
i
going
to
send
stan
martin
after
but
it
get
much
of
a
laugh
and
the
government
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
kind
of
censorship
it
was
every
one
of
the
really
great
comics
recognized
either
consciously
or
subconsciously
that
the
nipe
was
not
a
subject
for
humor
such
jokes
would
have
made
them
about
as
popular
as
the
borscht
circuit
comedian
who
told
a
funny
story
about
dachau
in
aside
from
the
subtle
coloring
given
it
by
the
small
group
of
propaganda
experts
the
news
went
out
straight
the
detective
himself
after
that
one
single
interview
vanished
from
sight
no
one
knew
where
he
was
though
again
there
were
all
kinds
of
speculations
all
of
them
erroneous
actually
he
was
a
carefully
guarded
and
willing
prisoner
in
a
suite
in
one
of
the
big
hotels
in
government
city
on
the
fourth
day
the
big
operation
began
without
fanfare
the
actual
maneuvering
to
capture
the
alien
that
had
terrorized
a
planet
began
shortly
after
noon
at
a
few
minutes
before
three
that
afternoon
the
man
whom
the
world
knew
as
stanley
martin
suddenly
suffered
a
dizzy
spell
and
nearly
fainted
then
almost
like
a
child
he
began
to
weep
colonel
walther
mannheim
said
it
will
take
five
years
stanton
he
was
looking
at
the
young
man
seated
in
one
of
the
three
chairs
in
the
small
comfortable
room
there
was
a
clublike
atmosphere
about
the
room
but
none
of
the
three
men
were
relaxed
five
years
said
the
young
man
he
looked
at
the
third
man
farnsworth
nodded
more
or
less
more
if
it
a
partial
failure
less
if
it
a
complete
failure
then
there
a
chance
of
failure
the
young
man
asked
there
is
always
a
chance
of
failure
in
any
major
surgical
undertaking
farnsworth
said
even
in
the
most
routine
cases
things
can
go
wrong
we
only
men
stanton
we
neither
magicians
nor
gods
i
know
that
doctor
the
young
man
said
nobody
perfect
and
i
do
expect
perfection
can
you
give
me
a
an
estimate
on
the
chances
i
ca
even
give
you
any
kind
of
guess
said
farnsworth
he
smiled
rather
grimly
so
far
we
have
had
no
failures
our
mortality
rate
is
a
flat
zero
we
have
never
lost
a
patient
because
we
never
had
one
as
i
told
you
this
will
be
the
first
time
the
operation
has
ever
been
performed
on
a
human
being
or
rather
he
corrected
himself
i
should
say
series
of
operations
this
is
not
one
single
er
job
like
an
appendectomy
all
right
then
call
it
a
series
of
operations
the
young
man
said
i
assume
each
of
them
has
been
performed
individually
not
exactly
some
of
them
have
never
been
performed
on
any
human
being
simply
because
they
require
not
only
special
conditions
but
they
require
that
the
steps
leading
up
to
them
have
already
been
performed
you
do
make
things
sound
very
rosy
doctor
i
not
trying
to
i
trying
to
give
you
the
facts
personally
i
think
we
have
a
better
than
ninety
percent
chance
of
success
i
try
it
if
i
thought
otherwise
with
modern
mathematical
methods
of
analyzing
medical
theory
we
can
predict
success
for
such
an
intricate
series
of
operations
we
can
predict
what
will
happen
when
massive
doses
of
hormones
and
enzymes
and
such
are
used
but
medicine
still
remains
largely
an
art
in
spite
of
all
that
in
parallel
operations
performed
on
primates
our
results
were
largely
successful
but
remember
that
not
even
every
human
being
has
the
genetic
structure
necessary
to
undergo
this
particular
treatment
and
a
gene
structure
is
quite
different
from
yours
or
mine
i
just
ask
you
one
question
the
young
man
said
firmly
if
were
being
asked
to
undergo
this
treatment
would
you
do
it
farnsworth
did
hesitate
all
things
considered
yes
i
would
what
do
you
mean
things
considered
the
very
fact
that
the
nipe
exists
and
that
this
is
the
only
method
of
dealing
with
him
that
is
even
remotely
possible
would
certainly
influence
my
opinion
farnsworth
said
i
might
not
be
so
quick
to
go
through
it
frankly
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
future
of
the
entire
human
race
would
depend
upon
my
decision
he
paused
then
added
i
would
hesitate
to
go
through
with
it
if
there
were
no
nipe
threat
not
because
i
would
be
afraid
that
the
operations
might
fail
but
because
of
what
i
would
be
afterward
um
yes
the
young
man
caught
his
lower
lip
between
his
teeth
and
thought
for
a
moment
yes
i
see
what
you
mean
being
a
lone
superman
in
a
world
of
ordinary
people
might
be
so
pleasant
colonel
mannheim
who
had
been
sitting
silently
during
the
discussion
between
the
two
men
said
look
stanton
i
know
this
is
tough
actually
it
a
lot
tougher
on
you
than
it
is
on
your
brother
because
have
to
make
the
decision
ca
but
i
want
you
to
keep
it
in
mind
that
there
nothing
compulsory
in
this
nobody
trying
to
force
you
to
do
anything
there
was
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
young
man
smile
as
he
looked
at
the
colonel
no
you
merely
remind
me
of
the
fact
and
leave
the
rest
to
my
sense
of
duty
colonel
mannheim
recognizing
the
slightly
altered
quotation
returned
his
smile
and
gave
him
the
next
line
sense
of
duty
the
bitterness
vanished
and
the
young
man
smile
became
a
grin
put
it
on
that
footing
he
quoted
back
in
a
melodramatic
voice
i
was
merciful
to
you
just
now
be
merciful
to
me
i
implore
you
not
to
insist
on
the
letter
of
your
bond
just
as
the
cup
of
happiness
is
at
my
lips
insist
on
nothing
returned
the
colonel
content
ourselves
with
pointing
out
farnsworth
had
no
notion
of
what
the
two
of
them
were
talking
about
but
he
kept
silent
as
he
noticed
the
tension
fading
you
have
appealed
to
my
sense
of
duty
the
young
man
continued
my
duty
is
all
too
clear
i
abhor
your
infamous
calling
i
shudder
at
the
thought
that
i
have
ever
been
mixed
up
with
it
but
duty
is
before
all
at
any
price
i
will
do
my
duty
spoken
said
the
colonel
you
are
one
of
us
once
more
on
i
follow
and
the
two
of
them
broke
out
in
laughter
while
farnsworth
looked
on
in
total
incomprehension
his
was
not
the
kind
of
mind
that
could
face
a
grim
situation
with
a
laugh
even
after
he
quit
laughing
the
smile
remained
on
the
young
man
face
all
right
colonel
you
win
we
go
through
with
it
martin
and
i
good
mannheim
said
warmly
do
you
have
the
papers
dr
farnsworth
right
here
farnsworth
said
opening
a
briefcase
that
was
lying
on
the
table
he
was
glad
to
be
back
in
the
conversation
again
he
took
out
a
thick
sheaf
of
papers
and
spread
them
on
the
table
then
he
handed
the
young
man
a
pen
you
have
to
sign
at
the
bottom
of
each
sheet
he
said
the
young
man
picked
up
the
papers
and
read
through
them
carefully
then
he
looked
up
at
farnsworth
they
seem
to
be
in
order
uh
about
martin
you
know
what
the
matter
with
him
i
mean
aside
from
the
radiation
do
you
think
he
be
able
to
handle
his
part
of
the
job
after
after
the
operations
i
quite
sure
he
will
the
operations
plus
the
therapy
we
give
him
afterward
should
put
him
in
fine
shape
well
he
looked
thoughtful
five
more
years
and
then
i
have
the
twin
brother
that
i
never
really
had
at
all
somehow
that
part
of
it
just
does
really
register
i
guess
do
worry
about
it
stanton
said
farnsworth
we
have
a
complex
enough
job
ahead
of
us
without
your
worrying
in
the
bargain
we
want
your
mind
perfectly
relaxed
you
have
your
own
ordeal
to
undergo
thanks
for
reminding
me
the
young
man
said
but
there
was
a
smile
on
his
face
when
he
said
it
he
looked
at
the
release
forms
again
all
nice
and
legal
huh
well
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
he
took
the
pen
and
wrote
in
a
firm
clear
hand
captain
davidson
greer
sat
in
a
chair
before
an
array
of
tv
screens
his
eyes
watchful
in
the
center
of
one
of
the
screens
the
nipe
image
sat
immobile
surrounded
by
the
paraphernalia
in
his
hidden
nest
other
screens
showed
various
sections
of
the
long
tunnel
that
led
south
from
the
opening
in
the
northern
end
of
the
island
at
the
captain
fingertips
was
a
bank
of
controls
that
would
allow
him
to
switch
from
one
pickup
to
another
if
necessary
so
that
he
could
see
anything
anywhere
in
the
tunnels
he
hoped
that
would
be
necessary
he
did
not
want
any
of
the
action
to
take
place
anywhere
but
in
the
places
where
it
was
expected
but
he
was
prepared
for
alterations
in
the
plan
in
other
rooms
nearly
a
hundred
other
men
were
linked
into
the
special
controls
that
allowed
them
to
operate
the
little
rat
spies
that
scuttled
through
the
underground
darkness
and
the
captain
system
would
allow
him
to
see
through
the
eyes
of
any
one
of
those
rats
at
an
instant
notice
the
screen
which
he
was
watching
at
the
moment
however
was
not
connected
with
an
underground
pickup
it
was
linked
with
a
pickup
in
the
bottom
of
a
sphere
driven
by
a
small
inertial
engine
that
held
the
sphere
hovering
in
the
air
above
the
game
sanctuary
on
the
northern
tip
of
manhattan
island
in
the
screen
he
had
an
aerial
view
of
the
grassy
rocky
mounds
where
the
earth
hid
the
shattered
and
partially
melted
ruins
of
buildings
in
the
center
of
the
screen
was
a
view
of
a
man
holding
a
rifle
he
was
walking
slowly
picking
his
way
carefully
along
the
bottom
of
the
shallow
gully
that
had
once
been
upper
broadway
barbell
the
captain
said
a
throat
microphone
picked
up
the
words
and
transmitted
them
to
the
ears
of
the
man
in
the
screen
barbell
this
is
barhop
there
are
no
wild
animals
within
sight
but
remember
we
see
everything
from
up
here
so
keep
your
eyes
open
right
barhop
said
a
rather
muffled
voice
in
the
captain
ear
fine
and
if
you
do
meet
up
with
anything
shoot
to
kill
there
were
plenty
of
wild
animals
in
the
game
sanctuary
some
of
them
dangerous
not
all
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
bronx
zoological
gardens
had
been
killed
on
that
day
when
the
sun
bomb
fell
being
farther
north
they
had
had
better
protection
and
some
of
them
later
had
wandered
southward
to
the
island
captain
greer
knew
perfectly
well
that
stanton
was
more
than
a
match
for
a
leopard
or
a
lion
but
he
did
want
stanton
to
tire
himself
fighting
with
an
animal
the
rifle
would
most
likely
never
be
used
it
was
merely
another
precaution
it
would
have
been
possible
and
perhaps
simpler
to
have
taken
stanton
to
the
opening
by
flyer
but
that
would
have
created
other
complications
traffic
rules
forbade
flyers
to
go
over
the
game
sanctuary
at
any
altitude
less
than
one
thousand
feet
one
flyer
going
in
low
would
have
attracted
the
attention
of
the
traffic
police
and
stanley
martin
wanted
no
attention
whatever
drawn
to
this
area
even
the
procedure
of
instructing
the
traffic
officers
to
ignore
one
flyer
would
have
attracted
more
attention
than
he
wanted
they
would
have
remembered
those
instructions
afterward
stanton
walked
captain
greer
eye
caught
something
at
the
edge
of
the
screen
it
moved
toward
the
center
as
the
floating
eye
moved
with
stanton
barbell
the
captain
said
there
a
deer
ahead
of
you
just
keep
moving
stanton
rounded
the
corner
of
a
pile
of
masonry
he
could
see
the
animal
now
himself
the
deer
stared
at
the
intruder
for
a
few
seconds
then
bounded
away
with
long
graceful
leaps
magnificent
animal
it
was
stanton
voice
very
low
the
remark
was
directed
toward
anyone
in
particular
captain
greer
answer
the
captain
lit
a
cigarette
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
on
the
screens
the
nipe
still
sat
unmoving
he
was
apparently
in
one
of
his
sleep
states
the
captain
was
sure
that
that
was
the
blessing
that
it
might
have
seemed
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
much
external
disturbance
it
would
take
to
wake
the
nipe
and
as
long
as
he
was
sitting
quietly
the
chances
were
greater
that
he
would
hear
movement
in
the
tunnel
if
he
were
active
his
senses
might
be
more
alert
but
he
would
also
be
distracted
by
his
own
actions
and
the
noises
he
made
himself
it
did
matter
the
captain
decided
one
way
was
as
good
as
another
in
this
case
the
point
was
to
get
stanton
into
an
advantageous
position
before
the
nipe
knew
he
was
anywhere
around
he
looked
back
at
the
image
of
stanton
a
figure
in
a
flexible
tough
suit
the
nipe
would
have
a
hard
time
biting
through
that
artificial
hide
but
it
gave
stanton
as
much
freedom
as
if
he
been
naked
stanton
knew
where
he
was
going
he
had
studied
maps
of
the
area
and
had
been
taken
on
a
vicarious
tour
of
the
route
by
means
of
the
very
flying
eye
that
was
watching
him
now
but
things
look
different
from
the
ground
than
from
the
air
and
no
amount
of
map
study
will
familiarize
a
person
with
terrain
as
completely
as
an
actual
personal
survey
stanton
paused
and
captain
greer
heard
his
voice
barhop
this
is
barbell
those
are
the
cliffs
up
ahead
are
they
that
right
barbell
you
go
up
that
slope
to
your
left
the
opening
is
in
that
pile
of
rock
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
they
higher
than
i
thought
stanton
commented
then
he
started
walking
again
the
tunnel
entrance
he
was
heading
for
had
once
been
a
wide
opening
drilled
laterally
into
the
side
of
the
cliff
and
big
enough
to
allow
easy
access
to
the
tunnels
so
that
the
passengers
of
those
old
underground
trains
could
get
to
the
platforms
where
they
stopped
but
the
sun
bomb
had
changed
all
that
the
concussion
had
shaken
loose
rock
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
a
minor
avalanche
had
obliterated
all
indications
of
the
tunnel
existence
except
for
one
small
narrow
opening
near
the
top
of
what
had
once
been
a
wide
hole
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
stanton
walked
slowly
toward
the
spot
until
he
was
finally
at
the
base
of
the
slope
of
rock
created
by
that
avalanche
up
there
he
asked
that
right
said
captain
greer
i
think
i
leave
the
rifle
here
barhop
stanton
said
no
point
in
carrying
it
up
the
slope
right
put
it
in
those
bushes
to
your
left
they
conceal
it
they
i
think
so
yeah
stanton
hid
the
rifle
and
then
began
making
his
way
up
the
talus
slope
captain
greer
flipped
a
switch
team
one
he
coming
in
are
those
alarms
deactivated
all
okay
barhop
said
a
voice
this
is
leader
one
i
meet
him
at
the
hole
right
captain
greer
reversed
the
switch
again
are
you
ready
barbell
stanton
looked
into
the
dark
hole
it
was
hardly
big
enough
to
crawl
through
and
ended
in
a
seeming
infinity
of
blackness
he
took
the
special
goggles
from
the
case
at
his
belt
and
put
them
on
inside
the
hole
he
saw
a
single
rat
staring
at
him
with
beady
eyes
i
ready
to
go
in
barhop
stanton
said
he
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
began
to
crawl
through
the
narrow
tunnel
ahead
of
him
the
rat
turned
and
began
to
lead
the
way
the
big
tunnel
inside
the
cliff
was
long
and
black
and
the
air
was
stale
and
thick
with
the
stench
of
rodents
stanton
stood
still
for
a
minute
stretching
his
muscles
crawling
through
that
cramped
little
opening
had
not
been
easy
he
looked
around
him
trying
to
probe
the
luminescent
gloom
that
the
goggles
he
wore
brought
to
his
eyes
the
tunnel
stretched
out
before
him
on
and
on
around
him
was
the
smell
of
viciousness
and
death
ahead
goes
on
to
stanton
thought
at
last
at
the
rat
paused
and
looked
back
waiting
for
him
to
follow
okay
stanton
muttered
let
go
the
rat
led
him
down
the
long
tunnel
deep
into
the
cliffside
until
at
last
they
came
to
a
stairway
that
led
downward
into
the
long
tunnels
where
the
trains
had
once
run
they
came
to
the
platform
where
passengers
had
once
waited
for
those
trains
four
feet
below
the
edge
of
the
platform
were
the
rusted
tracks
that
had
once
borne
those
trains
he
lowered
himself
over
the
edge
to
stand
on
the
rail
barbell
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
barhop
here
do
you
read
it
was
the
barest
whisper
picked
up
by
the
antennas
in
his
shoes
from
the
steel
rail
that
ran
along
the
floor
of
the
dark
tunnel
read
you
barhop
move
out
then
you
got
a
long
stroll
to
go
stanton
started
walking
keeping
his
feet
near
the
rail
in
case
greer
wanted
to
call
again
as
he
walked
he
could
feel
the
slight
motion
of
the
woven
suit
that
he
wore
rubbing
gently
against
his
skin
and
he
could
hear
the
scratching
patter
of
the
rats
mostly
they
stayed
away
from
him
avoiding
the
strange
being
that
had
invaded
their
underground
realm
but
he
could
see
them
hiding
in
corners
and
scurrying
along
the
sides
of
the
tunnels
going
about
their
unfathomable
rodent
business
around
him
six
robots
moved
with
him
shifting
their
pattern
constantly
as
they
patrolled
his
moving
figure
far
ahead
he
knew
other
rat
robots
were
stationed
watching
and
waiting
ready
to
deactivate
the
nipe
detection
devices
at
just
the
right
moment
behind
him
another
horde
moved
forward
to
turn
the
devices
on
again
it
had
he
knew
taken
the
technicians
a
long
time
to
learn
how
to
shut
off
those
detectors
without
giving
the
alarm
to
the
nipe
instruments
there
were
nearly
a
hundred
men
in
on
the
operation
controlling
the
robot
rats
or
watching
the
hidden
cameras
that
spied
upon
the
nipe
nearly
a
hundred
and
every
single
one
of
them
was
safe
they
were
all
outside
the
tunnel
and
far
away
they
were
with
stanton
only
by
proxy
they
could
not
die
here
in
this
stinking
hole
no
matter
what
happened
but
stanton
could
there
was
no
help
for
it
no
other
way
it
could
be
done
stanton
had
to
go
in
person
a
robot
proxy
might
be
stronger
although
not
faster
unless
stanton
was
at
the
controls
than
the
nipe
but
the
nipe
would
be
able
to
tell
that
the
thing
was
a
robot
and
he
would
simply
destroy
it
with
one
of
his
weapons
a
robot
could
never
get
close
enough
to
the
nipe
to
do
any
good
we
do
not
know
positively
yoritomo
had
said
whether
he
would
recognize
it
as
a
robot
or
not
but
his
instruments
would
show
the
metal
easily
enough
and
his
eyes
would
be
able
to
tell
him
that
the
machine
was
not
covered
with
human
skin
the
rats
are
small
enough
so
that
they
can
be
made
mostly
of
plastic
and
they
are
covered
with
real
rat
hides
in
addition
our
friend
the
nipe
is
used
to
seeing
them
around
but
a
robot
ah
no
never
so
stanton
had
to
go
in
person
walking
southward
along
the
tracks
through
the
miles
of
blackness
that
led
to
the
nest
of
the
nipe
overhead
was
government
city
he
had
looked
out
upon
those
streets
only
the
night
before
and
he
knew
that
only
a
short
distance
away
there
was
an
entirely
different
world
somewhere
up
there
his
brother
was
waiting
after
having
run
the
gamut
of
publicity
he
was
a
celebrity
stanley
martin
the
greatest
detective
in
the
solar
system
they
called
him
fine
stuff
that
stanton
wondered
what
the
asteroids
were
like
what
would
it
be
like
to
live
out
in
space
where
a
man
still
had
plenty
of
space
to
move
around
in
and
could
fashion
his
life
to
suit
himself
maybe
there
would
be
a
place
in
the
asteroids
for
a
superman
or
maybe
there
would
only
be
a
place
here
beneath
the
streets
of
government
city
for
a
dead
superman
if
i
can
help
stanton
thought
with
a
grim
smile
the
walking
seemed
to
take
forever
in
one
way
but
in
another
way
stanton
did
mind
it
he
had
a
lot
to
think
over
seeing
his
image
on
the
tv
had
been
unnerving
yesterday
but
today
he
felt
as
though
everything
had
been
all
right
all
along
his
memory
was
still
a
long
way
from
being
complete
and
it
probably
always
would
be
he
thought
he
could
still
scarcely
recall
any
real
memories
of
a
boy
named
martin
stanton
but
and
he
smiled
a
little
at
the
thought
he
knew
more
about
him
than
his
brother
did
even
so
it
made
very
little
difference
now
that
martin
stanton
was
gone
in
effect
he
had
been
demolished
what
little
there
had
been
of
him
and
a
new
structure
had
been
built
on
the
old
foundation
and
yet
it
was
highly
probable
that
the
new
structure
was
very
like
that
that
would
have
developed
naturally
if
the
accident
so
early
in
martin
stanton
life
had
never
occurred
stanton
kept
walking
there
was
a
timeless
feeling
about
his
march
through
the
depths
of
the
ground
as
though
every
step
through
the
blackness
was
exactly
like
every
other
step
and
it
was
only
the
same
step
over
and
over
again
he
skirted
a
pile
of
rubble
on
his
right
there
had
been
a
station
here
once
the
street
above
had
caved
in
and
filled
it
with
brick
concrete
cobblestones
and
steel
scrap
and
then
it
had
been
sealed
over
when
government
city
was
built
a
part
of
one
wall
was
still
unbroken
though
a
sign
built
of
tile
said
street
he
knew
although
it
was
hard
to
make
it
out
in
the
dim
glow
he
kept
on
walking
ignoring
the
rats
that
scampered
over
the
rubble
a
mile
or
so
farther
on
he
whispered
barbell
to
barhop
everything
going
barhop
to
barbell
came
the
answer
no
sign
of
any
activity
from
target
so
far
none
of
the
alarms
have
been
triggered
what
he
doing
stanton
whispered
it
seemed
only
right
to
keep
his
voice
low
although
he
was
fairly
certain
that
his
voice
would
not
carry
to
the
nipe
even
through
these
echoing
tunnels
he
was
still
miles
away
he
still
sitting
motionless
said
captain
greer
thinking
i
suppose
or
sleeping
it
hard
to
tell
all
right
let
me
know
if
he
starts
moving
will
you
will
do
unsuspecting
stanton
thought
long
years
of
hard
work
of
feeling
secure
in
his
little
nest
and
within
a
very
short
time
he
going
to
get
the
shock
of
his
or
maybe
not
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
what
kind
of
shocks
the
nipe
had
taken
in
the
course
of
his
life
stanton
thought
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
nipe
was
even
capable
of
feeling
anything
like
shock
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
odd
he
thought
that
he
should
feel
a
strong
kinship
toward
both
the
nipe
and
his
brother
in
such
similar
ways
he
had
never
met
the
nipe
and
his
brother
was
only
a
dim
picture
in
his
old
memories
but
they
were
both
very
well
known
to
him
certainly
they
were
better
known
to
him
than
he
was
to
them
and
yet
seeing
his
brother
face
on
the
tv
screen
hearing
his
voice
watching
the
way
he
moved
about
watching
the
changing
expressions
on
his
face
had
been
a
tremendously
moving
experience
not
until
that
moment
he
thought
had
he
really
known
himself
meeting
him
face
to
face
would
be
much
easier
now
but
it
would
still
be
a
scene
highly
charged
with
emotional
tension
his
foot
kicked
something
that
rattled
and
rolled
away
from
him
he
stopped
freezing
in
his
tracks
looking
downward
trying
to
pierce
the
dully
glowing
gloom
the
thing
he
had
kicked
was
a
human
skull
he
relaxed
and
began
walking
again
there
were
plenty
of
human
bones
down
here
mannheim
had
told
him
that
the
tunnels
had
been
used
as
shelters
when
the
sun
bomb
had
hit
the
island
during
the
holocaust
men
women
and
children
by
the
thousands
had
crowded
underground
after
the
warning
had
come
and
they
had
died
by
the
thousands
when
the
bright
hot
deadly
gases
had
roared
down
the
ventilators
and
stairwells
there
were
even
caches
of
canned
goods
down
here
some
of
them
still
perfectly
sealed
after
all
this
time
the
hordes
of
rats
wiser
than
they
knew
had
chewed
at
them
exposing
the
steel
beneath
the
thin
tin
plate
and
after
a
while
oxidation
would
weaken
the
can
to
the
point
where
some
lucky
rat
could
gnaw
through
the
rusty
spot
and
find
himself
a
meal
then
he
would
move
the
empty
can
aside
and
begin
gnawing
at
the
next
in
line
he
could
get
through
the
steel
but
he
would
scratch
the
tin
off
and
the
cycle
would
begin
again
later
another
rat
would
find
that
can
weak
enough
to
bite
through
it
kept
the
rats
fed
almost
as
well
as
an
automatic
machine
might
have
the
tunnel
before
him
was
an
endless
monochromatic
world
that
was
both
artificial
and
natural
here
was
a
neatly
mosaic
of
ceramic
tile
that
was
obviously
over
there
on
a
little
hillock
of
earth
squatted
a
colony
of
fat
mushrooms
in
several
places
he
had
to
skirt
little
pools
of
dark
stagnant
water
twice
he
had
to
climb
over
long
heaps
of
crumbling
rust
that
had
once
been
trains
of
subway
cars
he
kept
moving
one
man
alone
walking
through
the
dark
toward
a
superhuman
monster
that
had
terrorized
earth
for
a
decade
a
drug
that
would
knock
out
the
nipe
would
have
been
very
useful
but
to
synthesize
such
a
drug
would
have
required
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
biochemical
processes
of
the
nipe
than
any
human
scientist
had
the
same
applied
to
anesthetic
gases
or
electric
shock
or
supersonics
there
was
no
way
of
determining
how
much
would
be
required
to
knock
him
out
or
how
much
would
be
required
to
kill
there
were
no
easy
answers
the
only
answer
was
a
man
called
stanton
boots
boots
boots
marchin
up
and
down
again
and
there
no
discharge
in
the
war
stanton
hummed
the
song
in
his
mind
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
walking
forever
through
the
kingdom
of
hades
while
around
him
twittered
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
he
thought
entertaining
the
fancy
for
a
brief
moment
i
be
one
of
you
in
a
short
while
there
was
no
answer
though
the
squeaking
continued
the
sound
of
his
feet
and
the
snarling
chirping
of
the
rats
were
the
only
sounds
in
the
world
barhop
to
barbell
said
a
voice
suddenly
sounding
very
loud
in
his
ear
this
is
where
you
have
to
make
your
change
to
the
other
tunnel
barbell
to
barhop
i
know
i
been
watching
the
markers
just
precaution
barbell
captain
greer
said
how
do
you
feel
i
like
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
frankly
stanton
said
feeling
tired
there
was
just
the
barest
tinge
of
alarm
in
the
captain
voice
no
stanton
said
i
just
want
to
sit
down
and
rest
my
feet
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
pause
then
the
captain
voice
came
again
okay
go
ahead
and
relax
barbell
take
ten
but
be
ready
to
move
fast
if
i
yell
these
alarm
systems
are
tricky
things
to
hold
and
do
start
moving
again
without
letting
me
know
right
stanton
lifted
himself
out
of
the
trench
in
which
the
tunnel
ran
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
boarding
platform
it
was
far
now
there
was
only
one
more
of
the
old
entranceways
between
himself
and
the
nipe
this
particular
one
was
a
transfer
point
where
two
different
parts
of
the
tunnel
network
met
and
it
was
possible
to
transfer
from
one
to
another
it
required
going
up
a
couple
of
flights
of
stairs
to
the
next
higher
level
and
changing
to
another
tunnel
going
southward
there
were
other
ways
this
tunnel
the
one
he
had
been
following
for
so
long
branched
a
little
farther
south
if
he
took
one
branch
he
would
end
up
to
the
east
of
the
nipe
the
other
would
bring
him
to
a
point
on
the
west
from
either
he
would
have
to
travel
laterally
through
another
set
of
tunnels
but
neither
route
offered
anything
that
this
one
did
have
and
the
most
direct
route
would
be
best
barbell
to
barhop
he
whispered
i
ready
to
go
it
only
been
five
minutes
i
know
but
i
rest
pretty
fast
too
let
move
out
there
were
a
few
seconds
of
silence
then
captain
greer
said
all
set
barbell
move
out
stanton
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
toward
the
stairway
that
led
up
to
the
next
level
minutes
later
he
was
in
another
tunnel
exactly
similar
to
the
first
one
walking
southward
again
but
now
he
was
more
careful
he
watched
the
ground
carefully
making
sure
that
he
did
step
on
anything
that
would
snap
or
rattle
the
nipe
was
still
quite
a
distance
away
of
a
mile
or
so
but
taking
the
chance
that
the
beast
could
hear
him
might
be
deadly
dangerous
the
robot
rat
that
he
was
following
led
him
along
a
path
that
had
been
unobtrusively
cleared
of
rubble
by
the
robot
rats
over
a
period
of
months
but
the
robots
were
the
only
rats
in
the
place
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
path
a
while
later
the
voice
in
his
ear
said
a
hundred
yards
to
go
barbell
i
know
stanton
whispered
he
has
moved
no
i
yell
if
he
does
you
do
need
to
talk
any
more
his
ears
might
pick
up
even
that
whisper
has
stanton
thought
for
all
this
time
not
since
i
came
down
into
his
private
domain
all
this
time
he
has
been
sitting
motionless
waiting
would
it
be
funny
if
he
were
dead
if
his
heart
had
stopped
or
something
would
that
be
absolutely
hilarious
would
that
be
a
big
joke
on
everybody
especially
ahead
was
the
large
area
that
had
been
one
of
the
major
junction
points
of
the
tunnel
network
this
was
the
area
that
the
nipe
had
taken
over
to
build
his
here
were
his
workshops
his
laboratories
his
storerooms
and
somewhere
here
was
the
nipe
he
came
out
of
the
tunnel
into
another
area
just
to
his
left
was
another
short
stairway
that
led
up
to
a
slightly
higher
level
he
moved
slowly
and
quietly
he
did
want
to
fight
down
here
on
the
tracks
and
he
did
want
to
be
caught
just
yet
cautiously
he
lifted
himself
to
the
platform
where
passengers
had
once
waited
for
trains
the
quality
of
the
illumination
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
different
from
that
which
he
had
been
used
to
for
the
past
three
hours
he
lifted
off
the
goggles
enough
light
spilled
over
from
the
lair
to
give
him
illumination
to
see
by
silently
he
put
the
goggles
on
the
floor
of
the
platform
he
would
need
them
again
then
step
by
step
he
walked
up
the
concrete
stairway
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
paused
to
get
his
bearings
the
illumination
was
not
bright
but
it
was
enough
to
barbell
he
heard
you
watch
it
but
stanton
had
already
heard
the
movement
of
the
nipe
he
jerked
off
the
communicator
and
threw
it
down
the
stairs
behind
him
he
wanted
no
encumbrances
now
he
ran
quickly
out
into
the
center
of
the
big
underground
room
away
from
the
open
stairwell
and
then
as
fast
as
any
express
train
that
had
ever
moved
through
these
subterranean
ways
the
nipe
came
around
a
corner
thirty
feet
away
his
four
violet
eyes
gleaming
his
limbs
rippling
beneath
his
body
from
fifteen
feet
away
he
launched
himself
through
the
air
his
outstretched
hands
ready
to
kill
but
stanton
marvelous
neuromuscular
system
was
already
in
action
at
this
stage
of
the
game
it
would
be
utter
suicide
to
let
the
nipe
get
in
close
stanton
could
fend
off
eight
grasping
hands
with
his
own
two
he
leaped
to
one
side
and
the
nipe
got
his
first
surprise
in
ten
years
when
stanton
fist
slammed
against
the
side
of
his
snouted
head
knocking
him
in
the
direction
opposite
that
in
which
stanton
had
moved
the
nipe
landed
turned
and
charged
back
toward
the
man
this
time
he
reared
up
using
his
two
rearmost
pairs
of
limbs
for
locomotion
while
the
two
forward
pairs
were
held
out
ready
to
kill
he
got
surprise
number
two
when
stanton
fist
landed
on
the
tip
of
his
rather
sensitive
snout
rocking
his
head
back
his
own
hands
met
nothing
but
air
and
by
the
time
he
had
recovered
from
the
blow
stanton
was
well
back
out
of
the
way
so
small
stanton
thought
wonderingly
even
when
he
reared
up
the
nipe
head
was
only
three
feet
above
the
concrete
floor
the
nipe
came
in
again
more
cautiously
this
time
stanton
punched
again
with
a
straight
right
the
nipe
moved
his
head
aside
and
stanton
knuckles
merely
grazed
the
side
of
the
head
just
below
the
lower
right
eye
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
nipe
hands
swung
in
in
a
chopping
right
hook
that
took
stanton
just
below
the
ribs
stanton
leaped
back
with
a
gasp
of
pain
the
nipe
did
use
fists
he
used
his
open
hand
fingers
together
like
a
judo
fighter
the
nipe
came
forward
and
as
stanton
danced
back
the
nipe
made
a
grab
for
his
ankle
almost
catching
it
there
were
too
many
hands
to
watch
stanton
had
two
advantages
weight
and
reach
his
arms
were
almost
half
again
as
long
as
the
nipe
against
that
the
nipe
had
all
those
hands
and
with
his
low
center
of
gravity
and
stance
it
would
be
hard
to
knock
him
down
on
the
other
hand
if
stanton
lost
his
footing
the
fight
would
be
over
fast
stanton
lunged
suddenly
forward
and
planted
a
left
in
the
nipe
right
upper
eye
then
followed
it
with
a
right
uppercut
to
the
nipe
jaw
as
his
head
snapped
back
the
nipe
four
hands
cut
inward
from
the
sides
like
sword
blades
but
they
found
no
target
backing
away
stanton
realized
he
had
another
advantage
the
nipe
could
throw
a
straight
jab
his
shoulders
if
that
what
they
should
be
called
were
narrow
and
the
upper
arm
bones
were
articulated
properly
for
such
a
blow
the
alien
could
throw
a
mean
hook
but
he
had
to
get
in
close
to
deliver
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
was
the
fact
that
the
nipe
knew
plenty
about
human
anatomy
from
the
bones
out
stanton
knowledge
of
nipe
anatomy
was
almost
totally
superficial
he
wished
he
knew
if
and
where
the
nipe
had
a
solar
plexus
he
would
like
to
punch
something
soft
for
a
change
instead
he
tried
for
another
eye
he
danced
in
jabbed
and
danced
out
the
nipe
had
ducked
again
taking
the
blow
on
the
side
of
his
head
then
the
nipe
came
in
low
at
an
angle
trying
for
the
groin
for
his
troubles
he
got
a
knee
in
the
jaw
that
staggered
him
badly
one
grasping
hand
clutched
at
stanton
right
thigh
and
grabbed
hard
stanton
swung
his
fist
down
like
a
pendulum
and
knocked
the
arm
aside
but
there
was
a
slight
limp
in
his
movements
as
he
away
from
the
nipe
that
pinch
had
hurt
like
the
very
devil
stanton
was
angry
now
with
the
hot
controlled
anger
of
a
fighting
man
he
stepped
in
quickly
and
slammed
two
fast
hard
jabs
into
the
point
of
the
nipe
snout
jarring
the
monster
backward
and
this
time
it
was
the
nipe
who
scuttled
back
out
of
the
way
stanton
moved
in
fast
to
press
his
advantage
and
landed
a
beaut
on
the
nipe
lower
left
eye
then
he
tried
a
body
blow
it
was
too
successful
the
alien
had
an
endoskeleton
but
he
also
had
a
tough
hide
that
was
somewhat
like
thick
leathery
chitin
stanton
pulled
back
getting
out
of
the
way
of
the
nipe
judo
cuts
his
fists
were
beginning
to
hurt
and
his
leg
was
paining
him
badly
where
the
nipe
had
clamped
onto
it
and
his
ribs
were
throbbing
where
the
nipe
had
landed
that
single
blow
and
then
he
realized
that
so
far
the
nipe
had
only
landed
that
one
blow
punch
and
one
stanton
thought
with
a
touch
of
awe
only
other
damage
he
inflicted
has
been
to
my
knuckles
the
nipe
charged
in
again
then
he
leaped
suddenly
and
clawed
for
stanton
face
with
his
first
pair
of
hands
the
second
and
third
pairs
chopped
in
toward
the
man
body
the
last
pair
propelled
him
off
the
floor
stanton
stepped
back
and
drove
in
a
long
hard
right
hitting
him
just
below
the
jaw
where
his
throat
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
human
the
nipe
arced
backward
in
a
half
somersault
and
landed
flat
on
his
back
stanton
backed
up
a
little
more
waiting
while
the
nipe
wiggled
feebly
for
a
moment
marquis
of
queensberry
should
have
lived
to
see
he
thought
the
nipe
rolled
over
and
crouched
on
all
eight
limbs
his
violet
eyes
watched
stanton
but
the
man
could
read
no
expression
on
that
inhuman
face
did
not
for
a
moment
stanton
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
hissing
guttural
voice
had
come
from
the
crouching
monster
did
not
try
i
have
no
wish
to
kill
you
stanton
said
evenly
can
see
that
do
you
are
you
he
stopped
as
if
baffled
are
not
the
proper
words
do
you
follow
the
customs
stanton
felt
a
surge
of
triumph
this
was
what
george
yoritomo
had
guessed
might
happen
if
i
must
kill
you
stanton
said
carefully
i
myself
will
do
the
honors
you
will
not
go
uneaten
the
nipe
sagged
a
little
relaxing
all
over
had
hoped
it
was
so
it
was
the
only
thinkable
thing
i
saw
you
on
the
television
and
it
was
only
thinkable
that
you
came
for
stanton
sighed
inwardly
that
part
of
colonel
mannheim
strategy
had
worked
too
the
nipe
had
seen
all
the
publicity
releases
that
had
been
so
carefully
tailored
for
him
knew
you
were
out
on
the
the
nipe
went
on
i
had
decided
that
you
had
come
to
kill
since
you
did
not
what
are
your
thoughts
stanley
martin
that
we
should
help
each
other
stanton
said
it
was
as
simple
as
that
stanton
sat
in
his
hotel
room
smoking
a
cigarette
staring
at
the
wall
and
thinking
he
was
alone
again
all
the
fuss
and
feathers
and
foofaraw
were
over
farnsworth
was
in
another
room
of
the
suite
making
his
plans
for
a
complete
physical
examination
of
the
nipe
george
yoritomo
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
holding
a
conversation
with
the
nipe
drawing
the
alien
out
and
getting
him
to
talk
about
his
own
race
and
their
history
and
stanley
martin
was
plotting
the
next
phase
of
the
capture
the
stanton
smiled
a
little
colonel
mannheim
had
been
a
great
one
for
planning
all
right
every
little
detail
was
taken
care
of
it
had
sometimes
made
his
plans
more
complex
than
necessary
stanton
suspected
mannheim
had
tended
to
try
to
account
for
every
possible
eventuality
and
after
he
had
done
that
he
had
set
aside
a
few
reserves
here
and
there
just
in
case
they
might
be
useful
if
something
unforeseen
happened
all
things
considered
the
government
had
certainly
done
the
right
thing
and
in
picking
mannheim
they
had
picked
the
right
man
stanton
got
up
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
the
streets
of
government
city
eight
floors
below
what
would
those
people
down
there
think
if
they
were
told
the
true
story
of
the
nipe
what
would
the
average
citizen
say
if
he
discovered
that
at
this
very
moment
the
nipe
was
being
treated
almost
as
an
honored
guest
of
the
government
more
what
would
he
say
if
he
suspected
that
the
nipe
the
horrible
murderous
nipe
could
have
been
killed
easily
at
any
time
during
the
past
six
years
would
it
be
possible
for
anyone
to
explain
to
the
common
average
man
that
in
the
long
run
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
nipe
was
tremendously
more
valuable
to
the
race
of
man
than
the
lives
of
a
few
individuals
could
those
people
down
there
and
the
others
like
them
all
over
the
world
be
made
to
understand
that
by
his
own
lights
the
nipe
had
been
behaving
in
the
most
civilized
and
gentlemanly
fashion
he
knew
could
they
ever
be
made
to
understand
that
because
of
the
tremendous
wealth
of
priceless
information
stored
in
that
alien
brain
the
nipe
life
had
to
be
preserved
at
any
cost
or
would
they
scream
for
blood
farnsworth
assumed
that
stanley
martin
was
going
to
spread
a
story
about
the
nipe
death
a
carefully
concocted
story
about
how
stanley
martin
had
found
the
beast
and
the
police
had
killed
it
there
might
farnsworth
assumed
be
a
carefully
made
corpse
for
the
mob
to
hiss
at
maybe
farnsworth
was
right
but
stanton
had
the
feeling
that
martin
and
george
yoritomo
had
something
else
up
their
collective
sleeve
the
phone
hummed
stanton
walked
over
thumbed
the
answer
button
and
watched
george
yoritomo
face
take
shape
on
the
screen
bart
i
have
just
had
the
privilege
of
viewing
the
tapes
of
your
fight
with
our
friend
the
nipe
incredible
i
watched
the
original
on
the
screen
of
course
but
i
had
to
run
the
tapes
i
wanted
to
slow
it
down
so
that
i
could
see
what
actually
happened
magnificent
that
right
of
yours
he
jabbed
a
fist
out
shadowboxing
with
stanton
over
the
phone
circuit
awww
it
were
nuthin
maw
stanton
drawled
i
jes
sorta
flang
out
a
fist
an
he
got
in
the
way
of
course
but
such
a
fling
seriously
bart
i
want
to
run
those
tapes
over
again
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
as
best
you
can
just
what
went
on
in
your
mind
at
each
stage
of
the
fight
it
will
be
most
informative
you
mean
right
now
i
have
an
appointment
yoritomo
waved
a
hand
no
no
later
take
your
time
but
i
am
honestly
amazed
that
you
won
so
easily
i
knew
you
were
good
and
i
was
certain
you
win
but
i
must
admit
that
i
honestly
expected
you
to
be
injured
stanton
looked
down
at
his
bandaged
hands
and
felt
the
ache
of
his
broken
rib
and
the
pain
of
the
blue
bruise
on
his
thigh
in
spite
of
the
way
it
looked
he
had
actually
been
hurt
worse
than
the
nipe
had
that
boy
was
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
adapt
himself
to
fighting
in
a
new
way
just
as
you
predicted
he
told
yoritomo
he
fought
me
i
assume
in
just
the
way
he
would
have
fought
another
nipe
and
that
did
work
i
had
the
reach
on
him
and
i
could
maneuver
faster
besides
he
throw
a
straight
punch
with
those
shoulders
of
his
it
appeared
to
me
yoritomo
said
with
a
broad
grin
that
you
were
fighting
him
as
you
would
fight
another
human
being
eh
stanton
grinned
back
i
was
in
a
modified
way
but
i
was
confined
to
a
pattern
besides
i
won
the
nipe
did
and
that
all
that
counts
it
is
indeed
well
i
let
you
know
when
i
ready
for
your
impressions
of
the
fight
probably
tomorrow
some
time
say
in
the
afternoon
fine
george
yoritomo
nodded
his
thanks
and
his
image
collapsed
and
faded
from
the
screen
stanton
walked
back
over
to
the
window
but
this
time
he
looked
at
the
horizon
not
the
street
george
yoritomo
had
called
him
bart
it
funny
stanton
thought
how
habit
can
get
the
best
of
a
man
yoritomo
had
known
the
truth
all
along
and
now
he
knew
that
his
pupil
or
patient
whichever
it
was
was
aware
of
the
truth
and
still
he
had
called
him
bart
i
still
think
of
myself
as
he
thought
probably
always
and
why
not
why
should
he
martin
stanton
no
longer
existed
in
a
sense
he
had
never
existed
and
in
actual
fact
he
had
never
had
much
of
a
real
existence
he
was
only
a
bad
dream
he
had
always
been
a
bad
dream
and
now
that
the
dream
was
over
only
bart
was
real
he
thought
back
remembering
george
yoritomo
explanation
take
two
people
he
had
said
two
people
genetically
identical
damage
one
of
them
so
badly
that
he
is
helpless
and
useless
to
himself
and
to
others
damage
him
so
badly
that
he
is
always
only
a
step
away
from
death
the
vague
telepathic
bond
that
always
links
identical
twins
they
alike
they
say
becomes
unbalanced
under
such
conditions
normally
there
is
a
one
mind
is
as
strong
as
the
other
and
each
preserves
the
sense
of
his
own
identity
since
the
two
different
sets
of
sense
receptors
give
different
viewpoints
but
if
one
of
the
twins
is
damaged
badly
enough
then
something
must
happen
to
that
telepathic
linkage
usually
it
is
broken
but
the
link
between
you
and
your
brother
was
not
broken
instead
it
became
a
channel
what
happens
in
such
a
case
the
damaged
brother
in
order
to
escape
the
intolerable
prison
of
his
own
body
becomes
a
receptor
for
the
stronger
brother
thoughts
the
weaker
feels
as
the
stronger
feels
the
experience
of
the
one
becomes
the
experience
of
the
other
the
thrill
of
running
after
a
baseball
the
pride
of
doing
something
clever
with
the
hands
the
touch
of
a
girl
kiss
upon
the
lips
all
these
become
the
property
of
the
weaker
since
he
is
receiving
the
thoughts
of
the
stronger
there
is
of
course
no
flow
in
the
other
direction
the
stronger
brother
has
no
way
of
knowing
that
his
every
thought
is
being
duplicated
in
his
brother
mind
in
effect
the
damaged
brother
ceases
to
think
the
thoughts
in
his
mind
are
those
of
the
healthy
brother
the
feeling
of
identity
becomes
almost
complete
to
the
outside
observer
the
damaged
brother
appears
to
be
a
cataleptic
schizophrenic
completely
cut
off
from
reality
and
in
a
sense
he
is
stanton
walked
over
to
the
nightstand
by
the
bed
took
another
cigarette
from
the
pack
lit
it
and
looked
at
the
smoke
curling
up
from
the
tip
martin
became
a
cataleptic
he
thought
the
mind
of
martin
had
ceased
to
think
at
all
the
bart
part
of
him
had
not
wanted
to
be
disturbed
by
the
garbled
feeble
sensory
impressions
that
mart
body
provided
like
many
another
schizophrenic
martin
had
been
living
in
a
little
world
cut
off
from
the
actual
physical
world
around
his
body
the
difference
between
martin
condition
and
that
of
the
ordinary
schizophrenic
had
been
that
martin
little
dream
world
had
actually
existed
it
had
been
an
almost
exact
counterpart
of
the
world
that
had
existed
in
the
perfectly
sane
rational
mind
of
his
brother
bart
it
had
grown
and
developed
as
bart
had
fed
by
the
telepathic
flow
from
the
stronger
mind
to
the
weaker
there
had
been
two
barts
and
no
mart
at
all
but
there
had
been
only
one
human
being
between
them
bart
stanton
had
been
a
strong
capable
intelligent
active
human
being
the
duplicate
of
his
mind
was
just
a
recording
in
the
mind
of
a
useless
hulk
and
then
the
neurophysical
institute
had
come
into
the
picture
a
new
process
had
been
developed
by
farnsworth
and
his
crew
by
which
a
human
being
could
be
reconstructed
made
literally
into
a
superman
all
the
techniques
had
been
worked
out
in
careful
and
minute
detail
but
there
was
one
major
drawback
any
normal
human
body
would
resist
the
process
to
the
death
if
necessary
just
as
a
normal
human
body
will
resist
a
skin
graft
from
an
alien
donor
or
the
injection
of
an
alien
protein
but
the
body
of
martin
stanton
had
had
no
resistance
of
that
kind
it
had
long
been
known
that
ionizing
radiation
had
that
effect
on
an
organism
the
ability
to
resist
was
weakened
almost
destroyed
with
martin
stanton
body
perhaps
the
process
might
work
so
bartholomew
stanton
who
had
become
martin
legal
guardian
after
the
death
of
their
mother
had
given
permission
for
the
series
of
operations
that
would
rebuild
his
crippled
brother
the
telepathic
link
of
course
had
to
be
shut
off
for
a
time
at
least
if
it
remained
intact
martin
would
never
be
able
to
think
for
himself
no
matter
what
was
done
to
his
body
part
of
that
process
could
be
done
during
the
treatment
of
martin
but
only
if
bartholomew
would
he
had
done
his
part
he
had
submitted
to
deep
hypnosis
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
that
his
name
was
stanley
martin
to
think
of
himself
as
stanley
martin
the
martin
name
was
one
that
the
real
martin
mind
would
reject
utterly
that
mind
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
anything
named
martin
stanley
martin
then
had
gone
out
to
the
asteroids
in
his
mind
had
been
implanted
the
further
instructions
that
he
was
not
to
return
to
earth
nor
to
attempt
to
investigate
the
nipe
under
any
circumstances
the
simple
change
of
name
and
environment
had
been
just
enough
to
snap
the
link
during
a
time
when
martin
brain
had
been
inactivated
by
cold
therapy
and
anesthetics
only
the
sense
of
identity
had
remained
the
patient
was
still
bart
but
now
he
was
being
forced
to
think
for
himself
mannheim
had
used
them
both
naturally
colonel
mannheim
had
the
ability
to
use
anyone
at
hand
including
himself
to
get
a
job
done
stanton
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
time
mannheim
had
sent
for
stanley
martin
when
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
return
in
order
to
give
the
nipe
data
that
he
would
be
sure
to
misinterpret
a
special
series
of
code
phrases
in
the
message
had
released
stanley
martin
from
the
hypnotic
suggestions
that
had
held
him
for
so
long
he
knew
now
that
he
was
bartholomew
stanton
so
do
thought
the
man
by
the
window
have
a
lot
to
straighten
out
we
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
stanton
walked
over
and
opened
it
trying
not
to
think
it
was
like
looking
into
a
mirror
hello
bart
he
said
hello
bart
said
the
other
in
that
instant
complete
telepathic
linkage
was
restored
in
that
instant
they
both
knew
what
only
one
of
them
had
known
before
that
for
a
time
the
telepathic
flow
had
been
again
but
this
time
in
the
opposite
direction
that
stanley
martin
had
been
shaken
that
afternoon
when
his
own
mind
had
become
the
receptor
for
the
thoughts
and
he
had
experienced
completely
the
entire
battle
with
the
nipe
his
release
from
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
had
made
it
possible
there
was
no
need
for
further
words
duobus
there
was
unity
without
loss
of
identity
