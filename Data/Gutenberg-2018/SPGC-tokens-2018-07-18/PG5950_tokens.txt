succeeded
in
some
degree
in
awakening
an
interest
in
behalf
of
one
devoid
of
those
accomplishments
which
belong
to
a
heroine
almost
by
right
i
was
next
tempted
to
choose
a
hero
upon
the
same
unpromising
plan
and
as
worth
of
character
goodness
of
heart
and
rectitude
of
principle
were
necessary
to
one
who
laid
no
claim
to
high
birth
romantic
sensibility
or
any
of
the
usual
accomplishments
of
those
who
strut
through
the
pages
of
this
sort
of
composition
i
made
free
with
the
name
of
a
person
who
has
left
the
most
magnificent
proofs
of
his
benevolence
and
charity
that
the
capital
of
scotland
has
to
display
to
the
scottish
reader
little
more
need
be
said
than
that
the
man
alluded
to
is
george
heriot
but
for
those
south
of
the
tweed
it
may
be
necessary
to
add
that
the
person
so
named
was
a
wealthy
citizen
of
edinburgh
and
the
king
goldsmith
who
followed
james
to
the
english
capital
and
was
so
successful
in
his
profession
as
to
die
in
extremely
wealthy
for
that
period
he
had
no
children
and
after
making
a
full
provision
for
such
relations
as
might
have
claims
upon
him
he
left
the
residue
of
his
fortune
to
establish
an
hospital
in
which
the
sons
of
edinburgh
freemen
are
gratuitously
brought
up
and
educated
for
the
station
to
which
their
talents
may
recommend
them
and
are
finally
enabled
to
enter
life
under
respectable
auspices
the
hospital
in
which
this
charity
is
maintained
is
a
noble
quadrangle
of
the
gothic
order
and
as
ornamental
to
the
city
as
a
building
as
the
manner
in
which
the
youths
are
provided
for
and
educated
renders
it
useful
to
the
community
as
an
institution
to
the
honour
of
those
who
have
the
management
the
magistrates
and
clergy
of
edinburgh
the
funds
of
the
hospital
have
increased
so
much
under
their
care
that
it
now
supports
and
educates
one
hundred
and
thirty
youths
annually
many
of
whom
have
done
honour
to
their
country
in
different
situations
the
founder
of
such
a
charity
as
this
may
be
reasonably
supposed
to
have
walked
through
life
with
a
steady
pace
and
an
observant
eye
neglecting
no
opportunity
of
assisting
those
who
were
not
possessed
of
the
experience
necessary
for
their
own
guidance
in
supposing
his
efforts
directed
to
the
benefit
of
a
young
nobleman
misguided
by
the
aristocratic
haughtiness
of
his
own
time
and
the
prevailing
tone
of
selfish
luxury
which
seems
more
peculiar
to
ours
as
well
as
the
seductions
of
pleasure
which
are
predominant
in
all
some
amusement
or
even
some
advantage
might
i
thought
be
derived
from
the
manner
in
which
i
might
bring
the
exertions
of
this
civic
mentor
to
bear
in
his
pupil
behalf
i
am
i
own
no
great
believer
in
the
moral
utility
to
be
derived
from
fictitious
compositions
yet
if
in
any
case
a
word
spoken
in
season
may
be
of
advantage
to
a
young
person
it
must
surely
be
when
it
calls
upon
him
to
attend
to
the
voice
of
principle
and
instead
of
that
of
precipitate
passion
i
could
not
indeed
hope
or
expect
to
represent
my
prudent
and
benevolent
citizen
in
a
point
of
view
so
interesting
as
that
of
the
peasant
girl
who
nobly
sacrificed
her
family
affections
to
the
integrity
of
her
moral
character
still
however
something
i
hoped
might
be
done
not
altogether
unworthy
the
fame
which
george
heriot
has
secured
by
the
lasting
benefits
he
has
bestowed
on
his
country
it
appeared
likely
that
out
of
this
simple
plot
i
might
weave
something
attractive
because
the
reign
of
james
in
which
george
heriot
flourished
gave
unbounded
scope
to
invention
in
the
fable
while
at
the
same
time
it
afforded
greater
variety
and
discrimination
of
character
than
could
with
historical
consistency
have
been
introduced
if
the
scene
had
been
laid
a
century
earlier
lady
mary
wortley
montague
has
said
with
equal
truth
and
taste
that
the
most
romantic
region
of
every
country
is
that
where
the
mountains
unite
themselves
with
the
plains
or
lowlands
for
similiar
reasons
it
may
be
in
like
manner
said
that
the
most
picturesque
period
of
history
is
that
when
the
ancient
rough
and
wild
manners
of
a
barbarous
age
are
just
becoming
innovated
upon
and
contrasted
by
the
illumination
of
increased
or
revived
learning
and
the
instructions
of
renewed
or
reformed
religion
the
strong
contrast
produced
by
the
opposition
of
ancient
manners
to
those
which
are
gradually
subduing
them
affords
the
lights
and
shadows
necessary
to
give
effect
to
a
fictitious
narrative
and
while
such
a
period
entitles
the
author
to
introduce
incidents
of
a
marvellous
and
improbable
character
as
arising
out
of
the
turbulent
independence
and
ferocity
belonging
to
old
habits
of
violence
still
influencing
the
manners
of
a
people
who
had
been
so
lately
in
a
barbarous
state
yet
on
the
other
hand
the
characters
and
sentiments
of
many
of
the
actors
may
with
the
utmost
probability
be
described
with
great
variety
of
shading
and
delineation
which
belongs
to
the
newer
and
more
improved
period
of
which
the
world
has
but
lately
received
the
light
the
reign
of
james
of
england
possessed
this
advantage
in
a
peculiar
degree
some
beams
of
chivalry
although
its
planet
had
been
for
some
time
set
continued
to
animate
and
gild
the
horizon
and
although
probably
no
one
acted
precisely
on
its
quixotic
dictates
men
and
women
still
talked
the
chivalrous
language
of
sir
philip
sydney
arcadia
and
the
ceremonial
of
the
was
yet
exhibited
though
it
now
only
flourished
as
a
place
de
carrousel
here
and
there
a
knight
of
the
bath
witness
the
too
scrupulous
lord
herbert
of
cherbury
was
found
devoted
enough
to
the
vows
he
had
taken
to
imagine
himself
obliged
to
compel
by
the
a
or
squire
to
restore
the
of
ribbon
which
he
had
stolen
from
a
fair
damsel

lord
herbert

but
yet
while
men
were
taking
each
other
lives
on
such
punctilios
of
honour
the
hour
was
already
arrived
when
bacon
was
about
to
teach
the
world
that
they
were
no
longer
to
reason
from
authority
to
fact
but
to
establish
truth
by
advancing
from
fact
to
fact
till
they
fixed
an
indisputable
authority
not
from
hypothesis
but
from
experiment
the
state
of
society
in
the
reign
of
james
was
also
strangely
disturbed
and
the
license
of
a
part
of
the
community
was
perpetually
giving
rise
to
acts
of
blood
and
violence
the
bravo
of
the
queen
day
of
whom
shakspeare
has
given
us
so
many
varieties
as
bardolph
nym
pistol
peto
and
the
other
companions
of
falstaff
men
who
had
their
humours
or
their
particular
turn
of
extravaganza
had
since
the
commencement
of
the
low
country
wars
given
way
to
a
race
of
sworders
who
used
the
rapier
and
dagger
instead
of
the
far
less
dangerous
sword
and
buckler
so
that
a
historian
says
on
this
subject
that
private
quarrels
were
nourished
but
especially
between
the
scots
and
english
and
duels
in
every
street
maintained
divers
sects
and
peculiar
titles
passed
unpunished
and
unregarded
as
the
sect
of
the
roaring
boys
bonaventors
bravadors
quarterors
and
such
like
being
persons
prodigal
and
of
great
expense
who
having
run
themselves
into
debt
were
constrained
to
run
next
into
factions
to
defend
themselves
from
danger
of
the
law
these
received
countenance
from
divers
of
the
nobility
and
the
citizens
through
lasciviousness
consuming
their
estates
it
was
like
that
the
number
of
these
desperadoes
would
rather
increase
than
diminish
and
under
these
pretences
they
entered
into
many
desperate
enterprizes

succeeded
and
to
use
the

who
resembles
a

plays
off
in

which
its

that
spirit
of

extravagance

at

characters

indeed
is

in

vice
first
appeared
affecting
the
better
classes
in
its
gross
and
undisguised
depravity
the
entertainments
and
amusements
of
elizabeth
time

an
air
of

decent
restraint
which
became
the
court
of
a
maiden
sovereign
and
in
that
earlier
period
to
use
the
words

lost
half
its
evil
by
being
deprived
of
all
its
grossness
in
james
reign
on
the
contrary
the
coarsest
pleasures
were
publicly

unlimitedly
indulged
since
according
to
sir

of

vast

went

works
vol
iv
from
the
squire
of
alsatia
the
author
derived
some
few
hints
and
learned
the
footing
on
which
the
bullies
and
thieves
of
the
sanctuary
stood
with
their
neighbours
the
fiery
young
students
of
the
temple
of
which
some
intimation
is
given
in
the
dramatic
piece
such
are
the
materials
to
which
the
author
stands
indebted
for
the
composition
of
the
fortunes
of
nigel
a
novel
which
may
be
perhaps
one
of
those
that
are
more
amusing
on
a
second
perusal
than
when
read
a
first
time
for
the
sake
of
the
story
the
incidents
of
which
are
few
and
meagre
the
introductory
epistle
is
written
in
lucio
phrase
according
to
the
trick
and
would
never
have
appeared
had
the
writer
meditated
making
his
avowal
of
the
work
as
it
is
the
privilege
of
a
masque
or
incognito
to
speak
in
a
feigned
voice
and
assumed
character
the
author
attempted
while
in
disguise
some
liberties
of
the
same
sort
and
while
he
continues
to
plead
upon
the
various
excuses
which
the
introduction
contains
the
present
acknowledgment
must
serve
as
an
apology
for
a
species
of
hoity
toity
whisky
frisky
pertness
of
manner
which
in
his
avowed
character
the
author
should
have
considered
as
a
departure
from
the
rules
of
civility
and
good
taste
abbotsford
july
introductory
epistle
captain
clutterbuck
to
the
reverend
dryasdust
dear
sir
i
readily
accept
of
and
reply
to
the
civilities
with
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
honour
me
in
your
obliging
letter
and
entirely
agree
with
your
quotation
of
quam
bonum
et
quam
jucundum
we
may
indeed
esteem
ourselves
as
come
of
the
same
family
or
according
to
our
country
proverb
as
being
all
one
man
bairns
and
there
needed
no
apology
on
your
part
reverend
and
dear
sir
for
demanding
of
me
any
information
which
i
may
be
able
to
supply
respecting
the
subject
of
your
curiosity
the
interview
which
you
allude
to
took
place
in
the
course
of
last
winter
and
is
so
deeply
imprinted
on
my
recollection
that
it
requires
no
effort
to
collect
all
its
most
minute
details
you
are
aware
that
the
share
which
i
had
in
introducing
the
romance
called
the
monastery
to
public
notice
has
given
me
a
sort
of
character
in
the
literature
of
our
scottish
metropolis
i
no
longer
stand
in
the
outer
shop
of
our
bibliopolists
bargaining
for
the
objects
of
my
curiosity
with
an
unrespective
hustled
among
boys
who
come
to
buy
corderies
and
and
servant
girls
cheapening
a
pennyworth
of
paper
but
am
cordially
welcomed
by
the
bibliopolist
himself
with
pray
walk
into
the
captain
boy
get
a
chair
for
captain
clutterbuck
there
is
the
newspaper
captain
paper
or
here
is
the
last
new
work
there
is
a
folder
make
free
with
the
leaves
or
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
carry
it
home
or
we
will
make
a
bookseller
of
you
sir
and
you
shall
have
it
at
trade
or
perhaps
if
it
is
the
worthy
trader
own
publication
his
liberality
may
even
extend
itself
to
never
mind
booking
such
a
trifle
to
sir
it
is
an
pray
mention
the
work
to
your
reading
i
say
nothing
of
the
snug
literary
party
arranged
round
a
turbot
leg
of
mutton
or
some
such
gear
or
of
the
circulation
of
a
quiet
bottle
of
robert
cockburn
choicest
black
nay
perhaps
of
his
new
ones
all
these
are
comforts
reserved
to
such
as
are
freemen
of
the
corporation
of
letters
and
i
have
the
advantage
of
enjoying
them
in
perfection
but
all
things
change
under
the
sun
and
it
is
with
no
ordinary
feelings
of
regret
that
in
my
annual
visits
to
the
metropolis
i
now
miss
the
social
and
welcome
of
the
and
kindly
friend
who
first
introduced
me
to
the
public
who
had
more
original
wit
than
would
have
set
up
a
dozen
of
professed
sayers
of
good
things
and
more
racy
humour
than
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
as
many
more
to
this
great
deprivation
has
been
added
i
trust
for
a
time
only
the
loss
of
another
bibliopolical
friend
whose
vigorous
intellect
and
liberal
ideas
have
not
only
rendered
his
native
country
the
mart
of
her
own
literature
but
established
there
a
court
of
letters
which
must
command
respect
even
from
those
most
inclined
to
dissent
from
many
of
its
canons
the
effect
of
these
changes
operated
in
a
great
measure
by
the
strong
sense
and
sagacious
calculations
of
an
individual
who
knew
how
to
avail
himself
to
an
extent
of
the
various
kinds
of
talent
which
his
country
produced
will
probably
appear
more
clearly
to
the
generation
which
shall
follow
the
present
i
entered
the
shop
at
the
cross
to
enquire
after
the
health
of
my
worthy
friend
and
learned
with
satisfaction
that
his
residence
in
the
south
had
abated
the
rigour
of
the
symptoms
of
his
disorder
availing
myself
then
of
the
privileges
to
which
i
have
alluded
i
strolled
onward
in
that
labyrinth
of
small
dark
rooms
or
to
speak
our
own
antiquarian
language
which
form
the
extensive
of
that
celebrated
yet
as
i
proceeded
from
one
obscure
recess
to
another
filled
some
of
them
with
old
volumes
some
with
such
as
from
the
equality
of
their
rank
on
the
shelves
i
suspected
to
be
the
less
saleable
modern
books
of
the
concern
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
holy
horror
creep
upon
me
when
i
thought
of
the
risk
of
intruding
on
some
ecstatic
bard
giving
vent
to
his
poetical
fury
or
it
might
be
on
the
yet
more
formidable
privacy
of
a
band
of
critics
in
the
act
of
worrying
the
game
which
they
had
just
run
down
in
such
a
supposed
case
i
felt
by
anticipation
the
horrors
of
the
highland
seers
whom
their
gift
of
deuteroscopy
compels
to
witness
things
unmeet
for
mortal
eye
and
who
to
use
the
expression
of
collins
heartless
oft
like
moody
madness
stare
to
see
the
phantom
train
their
secret
work
still
however
the
irresistible
impulse
of
an
undefined
curiosity
drove
me
on
through
this
succession
of
darksome
chambers
till
like
the
jeweller
of
delhi
in
the
house
of
the
magician
bennaskar
i
at
length
reached
a
vaulted
room
dedicated
to
secrecy
and
silence
and
beheld
seated
by
a
lamp
and
employed
in
reading
blotted
footnote
the
uninitiated
must
be
informed
that
a
second
is
so
called
the
person
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
the
eidolon
or
representative
vision
of
the
author
of
waverley
you
will
not
be
surprised
at
the
filial
instinct
which
enabled
me
at
once
to
acknowledge
the
features
borne
by
this
venerable
apparition
and
that
i
at
once
bended
the
knee
with
the
classical
salutation
of
magne
parens
the
vision
however
cut
me
short
by
pointing
to
a
seat
intimating
at
the
same
time
that
my
presence
was
not
expected
and
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
i
sat
down
with
humble
obedience
and
endeavoured
to
note
the
features
of
him
with
whom
i
now
found
myself
so
unexpectedly
in
society
but
on
this
point
i
can
give
your
reverence
no
satisfaction
for
besides
the
obscurity
of
the
apartment
and
the
fluttered
state
of
my
own
nerves
i
seemed
to
myself
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
filial
awe
which
prevented
my
noting
and
recording
what
it
is
probable
the
personage
before
me
might
most
desire
to
have
concealed
indeed
his
figure
was
so
closely
veiled
and
wimpled
either
with
a
mantle
or
some
such
loose
garb
that
the
verses
of
spenser
might
well
have
been
applied
yet
certes
by
her
face
and
physnomy
whether
she
man
or
woman
only
were
that
could
not
any
creature
well
i
must
however
go
on
as
i
have
begun
to
apply
the
masculine
gender
for
notwithstanding
very
ingenious
reasons
and
indeed
something
like
positive
evidence
have
been
offered
to
prove
the
author
of
waverley
to
be
two
ladies
of
talent
i
must
abide
by
the
general
opinion
that
he
is
of
the
rougher
sex
there
are
in
his
writings
too
many
things
quae
maribus
sola
tribuuntur
to
permit
me
to
entertain
any
doubt
on
that
subject
i
will
proceed
in
the
manner
of
dialogue
to
repeat
as
nearly
as
i
can
what
passed
betwixt
us
only
observing
that
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
my
timidity
imperceptibly
gave
way
under
the
familiarity
of
his
address
and
that
in
the
concluding
part
of
our
dialogue
i
perhaps
argued
with
fully
as
much
confidence
as
was
beseeming
of
i
was
willing
to
see
you
captain
clutterbuck
being
the
person
of
my
family
whom
i
have
most
regard
for
since
the
death
of
jedediah
cleishbotham
and
i
am
afraid
i
may
have
done
you
some
wrong
in
assigning
to
you
the
monastery
as
a
portion
of
my
effects
i
have
some
thoughts
of
making
it
up
to
you
by
naming
you
godfather
to
this
yet
unborn
babe
he
indicated
the
with
his
finger
but
first
touching
the
monastery
how
says
the
world
you
are
abroad
and
can
learn
hem
hem
the
enquiry
is
delicate
i
have
not
heard
any
complaints
from
the
publishers
that
is
the
principal
matter
but
yet
an
indifferent
work
is
sometimes
towed
on
by
those
which
have
left
harbour
before
it
with
the
breeze
in
their
what
say
the
critics
there
is
a
general
feeling
that
the
white
lady
is
no
favourite
i
think
she
is
a
failure
myself
but
rather
in
execution
than
conception
could
i
have
evoked
an
at
the
same
time
fantastic
and
interesting
capricious
and
kind
a
sort
of
wildfire
of
the
elements
bound
by
no
fixed
laws
or
motives
of
action
faithful
and
fond
yet
teazing
and
uncertain
if
you
will
pardon
the
interruption
sir
i
think
you
are
describing
a
pretty
woman
on
my
word
i
believe
i
am
i
must
invest
my
elementary
spirits
with
a
little
human
flesh
and
blood
they
are
too
for
the
present
taste
of
the
public
they
object
too
that
the
object
of
your
nixie
ought
to
have
been
more
uniformly
noble
her
ducking
the
priest
was
no
amusement
ah
they
ought
to
allow
for
the
capriccios
of
what
is
after
all
but
a
better
sort
of
goblin
the
bath
into
which
ariel
the
most
delicate
creation
of
shakspeare
imagination
seduces
our
jolly
friend
trinculo
was
not
of
amber
or
but
no
one
shall
find
me
rowing
against
the
stream
i
care
not
who
knows
it
i
write
for
general
amusement
and
though
i
never
will
aim
at
popularity
by
what
i
think
unworthy
means
i
will
not
on
the
other
hand
be
pertinacious
in
the
defence
of
my
own
errors
against
the
voice
of
the
public
you
abandon
then
in
the
present
work
looking
in
my
turn
towards
the
the
mystic
and
the
magical
and
the
whole
system
of
signs
wonders
and
omens
there
are
no
dreams
or
presages
or
obscure
allusions
to
future
events
not
a
scratch
my
son
not
one
bounce
on
the
drum
of
tedworth
not
so
much
as
the
poor
tick
of
a
solitary
in
the
wainscot
all
is
clear
and
above
board
a
scots
metaphysician
might
believe
every
word
of
it
and
the
story
is
i
hope
natural
and
probable
commencing
strikingly
proceeding
naturally
ending
happily
like
the
course
of
a
famed
river
which
gushes
from
the
mouth
of
some
obscure
and
romantic
grotto
then
gliding
on
never
pausing
never
precipitating
its
course
visiting
as
it
were
by
natural
instinct
whatever
worthy
subjects
of
interest
are
presented
by
the
country
through
which
it
passes
widening
and
deepening
in
interest
as
it
flows
on
and
at
length
arriving
at
the
final
catastrophe
as
at
some
mighty
haven
where
ships
of
all
kinds
strike
sail
and
yard
hey
hey
what
the
deuce
is
all
this
why
is
ercles
vein
and
it
would
require
some
one
much
more
like
hercules
than
i
to
produce
a
story
which
should
gush
and
glide
and
never
pause
and
visit
and
widen
and
deepen
and
all
the
rest
o
i
should
be
in
the
grave
man
before
i
had
done
with
my
task
and
in
the
meanwhile
all
the
quirks
and
quiddities
which
i
might
have
devised
for
my
amusement
would
lie
rotting
in
my
gizzard
like
sancho
suppressed
witticisms
when
he
was
under
his
master
there
never
was
a
novel
written
on
this
plan
while
the
world
stood

me
tom
jones
true
and
perhaps
amelia
also
fielding
had
high
notions
of
the
dignity
of
an
art
which
he
may
be
considered
as
having
founded
he
challenges
a
comparison
between
the
novel
and
the
epic
smollett
le
sage
and
others
emancipating
themselves
from
the
strictness
of
the
rules
he
has
laid
down
have
written
rather
a
history
of
the
miscellaneous
adventures
which
befall
an
individual
in
the
course
of
life
than
the
plot
of
a
regular
and
connected
epopeia
where
every
step
brings
us
a
point
nearer
to
the
final
catastrophe
these
great
masters
have
been
satisfied
if
they
amused
the
reader
upon
the
road
though
the
conclusion
only
arrived
because
the
tale
must
have
an
end
just
as
the
traveller
alights
at
the
inn
because
it
is
evening
a
very
commodious
mode
of
travelling
for
the
author
at
least
in
short
sir
you
are
of
opinion
with
bayes
what
the
devil
does
the
plot
signify
except
to
bring
in
fine
things
grant
that
i
were
so
and
that
i
should
write
with
sense
and
spirit
a
few
scenes
unlaboured
and
loosely
put
together
but
which
had
sufficient
interest
in
them
to
amuse
in
one
corner
the
pain
of
body
in
another
to
relieve
anxiety
of
mind
in
a
third
place
to
unwrinkle
a
brow
bent
with
the
furrows
of
daily
toil
in
another
to
fill
the
place
of
bad
thoughts
or
to
suggest
better
in
yet
another
to
induce
an
idler
to
study
the
history
of
his
country
in
all
save
where
the
perusal
interrupted
the
discharge
of
serious
duties
to
furnish
harmless
amusement
might
not
the
author
of
such
a
work
however
inartificially
executed
plead
for
his
errors
and
negligences
the
excuse
of
the
slave
who
about
to
be
punished
for
having
spread
the
false
report
of
a
victory
saved
himself
by
exclaiming
am
i
to
blame
o
athenians
who
have
given
you
one
happy
day
will
your
goodness
permit
me
to
mention
an
anecdote
of
my
excellent
grandmother
i
see
little
she
can
have
to
do
with
the
subject
captain
clutterbuck
it
may
come
into
our
dialogue
on
bayes
the
sagacious
old
lady
rest
her
soul
was
a
good
friend
to
the
church
and
could
never
hear
a
minister
maligned
by
evil
tongues
without
taking
his
part
warmly
there
was
one
fixed
point
however
at
which
she
always
abandoned
the
cause
of
her
reverend
it
was
so
soon
as
she
learned
he
had
preached
a
regular
sermon
against
slanderers
and
backbiters
and
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
only
that
i
have
heard
engineers
say
that
one
may
betray
the
weak
point
to
the
enemy
by
too
much
ostentation
of
fortifying
it
and
once
more
i
pray
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
nay
then
without
farther
metaphor
i
am
afraid
this
new
production
in
which
your
generosity
seems
willing
to
give
me
some
concern
will
stand
much
in
need
of
apology
since
you
think
proper
to
begin
your
defence
before
the
case
is
on
story
is
hastily
huddled
up
i
will
venture
a
pint
of
claret
a
pint
of
port
i
suppose
you
mean
i
say
of
claret
good
claret
of
the
monastery
ah
sir
would
you
but
take
the
advice
of
your
friends
and
try
to
deserve
at
least
of
the
public
favour
you
have
met
with
we
might
all

tokay
i
care
not
what
i
drink
so
the
liquor
be
wholesome
care
for
your
reputation
then
for
your
fame
my
fame
i
will
answer
you
as
a
very
ingenious
able
and
experienced
friend

notorious
jem
maccoul
replied
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
bar
when
they
laid
weight
on
his
refusing
to
answer
certain
queries
which
they
said
any
man
who
had
a
regard
for
his
reputation
would
not
hesitate
to
reply
to
my
client
said
the
way
jem
was
standing
behind
him
at
the
time
and
a
rich
scene
it
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
no
regard
for
his
reputation
and
i
should
deal
very
uncandidly
with
the
court
should
i
say
he
had
any
that
was
worth
his
i
am
though
from
very
different
reasons
in
jem
happy
state
of
indifference
let
fame
follow
those
who
have
a
substantial
shape
a
shadow
and
an
impersonal
author
is
nothing
better
can
cast
no
shade
you
are
not
now
perhaps
so
impersonal
as
these
letters
to
the
member
for
the
university
of
oxford
show
the
wit
genius
and
delicacy
of
the
author
which
i
heartily
wish
to
see
engaged
on
a
subject
of
more
importance
and
show
besides
that
the
preservation
of
my
character
of
has
engaged
early
talent
in
the
discussion
of
a
curious
question
of
evidence
but
a
cause
however
ingeniously
pleaded
is
not
therefore
gained
you
may
remember
the
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
so
artificially
brought
forward
to
prove
sir
philip
francis
title
to
the
letters
of
junius
seemed
at
first
irrefragable
yet
the
influence
of
the
reasoning
has
passed
away
and
junius
in
the
general
opinion
is
as
much
unknown
as
ever
but
on
this
subject
i
will
not
be
soothed
or
provoked
into
saying
one
word
more
to
say
who
i
am
not
would
be
one
step
towards
saying
who
i
am
and
as
i
desire
not
any
more
than
a
certain
justice
of
peace
mentioned
by
shenstone
the
noise
or
report
such
things
make
in
the
world
i
shall
continue
to
be
silent
on
a
subject
which
in
my
opinion
is
very
undeserving
the
noise
that
has
been
made
about
it
and
still
more
unworthy
of
the
serious
employment
of
such
ingenuity
as
has
been
displayed
by
the
young
but
allowing
my
dear
sir
that
you
care
not
for
your
personal
reputation
or
for
that
of
any
literary
person
upon
whose
shoulders
your
faults
may
be
visited
allow
me
to
say
that
common
gratitude
to
the
public
which
has
received
you
so
kindly
and
to
the
critics
who
have
treated
you
so
leniently
ought
to
induce
you
to
bestow
more
pains
on
your
story
i
do
entreat
you
my
son
as
johnson
would
have
said
free
your
mind
from
for
the
critics
they
have
their
business
and
i
mine
as
the
nursery
proverb
goes
the
children
in
holland
take
pleasure
in
making
what
the
children
in
england
take
pleasure
in
i
am
their
humble
jackal
too
busy
in
providing
food
for
them
to
have
time
for
considering
whether
they
swallow
or
reject
to
the
public
i
stand
pretty
nearly
in
the
relation
of
the
postman
who
leaves
a
packet
at
the
door
of
an
individual
if
it
contains
pleasing
intelligence
a
billet
from
a
mistress
a
letter
from
an
absent
son
a
remittance
from
a
correspondent
supposed
to
be
bankrupt
the
letter
is
acceptably
welcome
and
read
and
folded
up
filed
and
safely
deposited
in
the
bureau
if
the
contents
are
disagreeable
if
it
comes
from
a
dun
or
from
a
bore
the
correspondent
is
cursed
the
letter
is
thrown
into
the
fire
and
the
expense
of
postage
is
heartily
regretted
while
all
the
time
the
bearer
of
the
dispatches
is
in
either
case
as
little
thought
on
as
the
snow
of
last
christmas
the
utmost
extent
of
kindness
between
the
author
and
the
public
which
can
really
exist
is
that
the
world
are
disposed
to
be
somewhat
indulgent
to
the
succeeding
works
of
an
original
favourite
were
it
but
on
account
of
the
habit
which
the
public
mind
has
acquired
while
the
author
very
naturally
thinks
well
of
taste
who
have
so
liberally
applauded
productions
but
i
deny
there
is
any
call
for
gratitude
properly
so
called
either
on
one
side
or
the
other
respect
to
yourself
then
ought
to
teach
caution
ay
if
caution
could
augment
the
chance
of
my
success
but
to
confess
to
you
the
truth
the
works
and
passages
in
which
i
have
succeeded
have
uniformly
been
written
with
the
greatest
rapidity
and
when
i
have
seen
some
of
these
placed
in
opposition
with
others
and
commended
as
more
highly
finished
i
could
appeal
to
pen
and
standish
that
the
parts
in
which
i
have
come
feebly
off
were
by
much
the
more
laboured
besides
i
doubt
the
beneficial
effect
of
too
much
delay
both
on
account
of
the
author
and
the
public
a
man
should
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
and
hoist
sail
while
the
wind
is
fair
if
a
successful
author
keep
not
the
stage
another
instantly
takes
his
ground
if
a
writer
lie
by
for
ten
years
ere
he
produces
a
second
work
he
is
superseded
by
others
or
if
the
age
is
so
poor
of
genius
that
this
does
not
happen
his
own
reputation
becomes
his
greatest
obstacle
the
public
will
expect
the
new
work
to
be
ten
times
better
than
its
predecessor
the
author
will
expect
it
should
be
ten
times
more
popular
and
is
a
hundred
to
ten
that
both
are
disappointed
this
may
justify
a
certain
degree
of
rapidity
in
publication
but
not
that
which
is
proverbially
said
to
be
no
speed
you
should
take
time
at
least
to
arrange
your
story
that
is
a
sore
point
with
me
my
son
believe
me
i
have
not
been
fool
enough
to
neglect
ordinary
precautions
i
have
repeatedly
laid
down
my
future
work
to
scale
divided
it
into
volumes
and
chapters
and
endeavoured
to
construct
a
story
which
i
meant
should
evolve
itself
gradually
and
strikingly
maintain
suspense
and
stimulate
curiosity
and
which
finally
should
terminate
in
a
striking
catastrophe
but
i
think
there
is
a
demon
who
seats
himself
on
the
feather
of
my
pen
when
i
begin
to
write
and
leads
it
astray
from
the
purpose
characters
expand
under
my
hand
incidents
are
multiplied
the
story
lingers
while
the
materials
increase
my
regular
mansion
turns
out
a
gothic
anomaly
and
the
work
is
closed
long
before
i
have
attained
the
point
i
proposed
resolution
and
determined
forbearance
might
remedy
that
evil
alas
my
dear
sir
you
do
not
know
the
force
of
paternal
affection
when
i
light
on
such
a
character
as
bailie
jarvie
or
dalgetty
my
imagination
brightens
and
my
conception
becomes
clearer
at
every
step
which
i
take
in
his
company
although
it
leads
me
many
a
weary
mile
away
from
the
regular
road
and
forces
me
leap
hedge
and
ditch
to
get
back
into
the
route
again
if
i
resist
the
temptation
as
you
advise
me
my
thoughts
become
prosy
flat
and
dull
i
write
painfully
to
myself
and
under
a
consciousness
of
flagging
which
makes
me
flag
still
more
the
sunshine
with
which
fancy
had
invested
the
incidents
departs
from
them
and
leaves
every
thing
dull
and
gloomy
i
am
no
more
the
same
author
i
was
in
my
better
mood
than
the
dog
in
a
wheel
condemned
to
go
round
and
round
for
hours
is
like
the
same
dog
merrily
chasing
his
own
tail
and
gambolling
in
all
the
frolic
of
unrestrained
freedom
in
short
sir
on
such
occasions
i
think
i
am
bewitched
nay
sir
if
you
plead
sorcery
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
he
must
needs
go
whom
the
devil
drives
and
this
i
suppose
sir
is
the
reason
why
you
do
not
make
the
theatrical
attempt
to
which
you
have
been
so
often
urged
it
may
pass
for
one
good
reason
for
not
writing
a
play
that
i
can
not
form
a
plot
but
the
truth
is
that
the
idea
adopted
by
too
favourable
judges
of
my
having
some
aptitude
for
that
department
of
poetry
has
been
much
founded
on
those
scraps
of
old
plays
which
being
taken
from
a
source
inaccessible
to
collectors
they
have
hastily
considered
the
offspring
of
my
now
the
manner
in
which
i
became
possessed
of
these
fragments
is
so
extraordinary
that
i
can
not
help
telling
it
to
you
you
must
know
that
some
twenty
years
since
i
went
down
to
visit
an
old
friend
in
worcestershire
who
had
served
with
me
in
the
dragoons
then
you
served
sir
i
have
or
i
have
not
which
signifies
the
same
thing
captain
is
a
good
travelling
i
found
my
friend
house
unexpectedly
crowded
with
guests
and
as
usual
was
condemned
the
mansion
being
an
old
one
to
the
i
have
as
a
great
modern
said
seen
too
many
ghosts
to
believe
in
them
so
betook
myself
seriously
to
my
repose
lulled
by
the
wind
rustling
among
the
the
branches
of
which
chequered
the
moonlight
which
fell
on
the
floor
through
the
diamonded
casement
when
behold
a
darker
shadow
interposed
itself
and
i
beheld
visibly
on
the
floor
of
the
apartment
the
white
lady
of
avenel
i
suppose
you
have
told
the
very
story
before
no
i
beheld
a
female
form
with
bib
and
apron
sleeves
tucked
up
to
the
elbow
a
in
the
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
i
concluded
of
course
that
it
was
my
walking
in
her
sleep
and
as
i
knew
he
had
a
value
for
sally
who
could
toss
a
pancake
with
any
girl
in
the
country
i
got
up
to
conduct
her
safely
to
the
door
but
as
i
approached
her
she
said
hold
sir
i
am
not
what
you
take
me
for
words
which
seemed
so
opposite
to
the
circumstances
that
i
should
not
have
much
minded
them
had
it
not
been
for
the
peculiarly
hollow
sound
in
which
they
were
know
then
she
said
in
the
same
unearthly
accents
that
i
am
the
spirit
of
betty
who
hanged
herself
for
love
of
the
thought
i
this
is
a
proper
spot
of
work
of
that
unhappy
elizabeth
or
betty
barnes
long
to
warburton
the
painful
collector
but
ah
the
too
careless
custodier
of
the
largest
collection
of
ancient
plays
ever
known
of
most
of
which
the
titles
only
are
left
to
gladden
the
prolegomena
of
the
variorum
shakspeare
yes
stranger
it
was
these
hands
that
consigned
to
grease
and
conflagration
the
scores
of
small
quartos
which
did
they
now
exist
would
drive
the
whole
roxburghe
club
out
of
their
senses
it
was
these
unhappy
pickers
and
stealers
that
singed
fat
fowls
and
wiped
dirty
trenchers
with
the
lost
works
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
massinger
jonson
webster
what
shall
i
say
even
of
shakspeare
himself
like
every
dramatic
antiquary
my
ardent
curiosity
after
some
play
named
in
the
book
of
the
master
of
revels
had
often
been
checked
by
finding
the
object
of
my
research
numbered
amongst
the
holocaust
of
victims
which
this
unhappy
woman
had
sacrificed
to
the
god
of
good
cheer
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
like
the
hermit
of
parnell
i
broke
the
bands
of
fear
and
madly
cried
careless
jade
but
scarce
the
words
began
when
betty
brandish
high
her
beware
she
said
you
do
not
by
your
anger
cut
off
the
opportunity
i
yet
have
to
indemnify
the
world
for
the
errors
of
my
ignorance
in
yonder
not
used
for
many
a
year
repose
the
few
greasy
and
blackened
fragments
of
the
elder
drama
which
were
not
totally
destroyed
do
thou
then
why
what
do
you
stare
at
captain
by
my
soul
it
is
true
as
my
friend
major
longbow
says
what
should
i
tell
you
a
lie
for
lie
sir
nay
heaven
forbid
i
should
apply
the
word
to
a
person
so
veracious
you
are
only
inclined
to
chase
your
tail
a
little
this
morning
that
all
had
you
not
better
reserve
this
legend
to
form
an
introduction
to
three
recovered
dramas
or
so
you
are
quite
right
habit
a
strange
thing
my
son
i
had
forgot
whom
i
was
speaking
to
yes
plays
for
the
closet
not
for
the
stage
right
and
so
you
are
sure
to
be
acted
for
the
managers
while
thousands
of
volunteers
are
desirous
of
serving
them
are
wonderfully
partial
to
pressed
men
i
am
a
living
witness
having
been
like
a
second
laberius
made
a
dramatist
whether
i
would
or
not
i
believe
my
muse
would
be
into
treading
the
stage
even
if
i
should
write
a
sermon
truly
if
you
did
i
am
afraid
folks
might
make
a
farce
of
it
and
therefore
should
you
change
your
style
i
still
advise
a
volume
of
dramas
like
lord
byron
no
his
lordship
is
a
cut
above
me
i
wo
run
my
horse
against
his
if
i
can
help
myself
but
there
is
my
friend
allan
has
written
just
such
a
play
as
i
might
write
myself
in
a
very
sunny
day
and
with
one
of
bramah
pens
i
can
not
make
neat
work
without
such
appurtenances
do
you
mean
allan
ramsay
no
nor
barbara
allan
either
i
mean
allan
cunningham
who
has
just
published
his
tragedy
of
sir
marmaduke
maxwell
full
of
and
murdering
kissing
and
cutting
of
throats
and
passages
which
lead
to
nothing
and
which
are
very
pretty
passages
for
all
that
not
a
glimpse
of
probability
is
there
about
the
plot
but
so
much
animation
in
particular
passages
and
such
a
vein
of
poetry
through
the
whole
as
i
dearly
wish
i
could
infuse
into
my
culinary
remains
should
i
ever
be
tempted
to
publish
them
with
a
popular
impress
people
would
read
and
admire
the
beauties
of
allan
as
it
is
they
may
perhaps
only
note
his
defects
or
what
is
worse
not
note
him
at
but
never
mind
them
honest
allan
you
are
a
credit
to
caledonia
for
all
there
are
some
lyrical
effusions
of
his
too
which
you
would
do
well
to
read
captain
it
hame
and
it
hame
is
equal
to
burns
i
will
take
the
hint
the
club
at
kennaquhair
are
turned
fastidious
since
catalan
visited
the
abbey
my
poortith
cauld
has
been
received
both
poorly
and
coldly
and
the
banks
of
bonnie
doon
have
been
positively
coughed
down
they
can
not
stand
still
they
will
change
with
all
of
us
what
then
a
man
a
man
for
a
but
the
hour
of
parting
approaches
you
are
determined
to
proceed
then
in
your
own
system
are
you
aware
that
an
unworthy
motive
may
be
assigned
for
this
rapid
succession
of
publication
you
will
be
supposed
to
work
merely
for
the
lucre
of
gain
supposing
that
i
did
permit
the
great
advantages
which
must
be
derived
from
success
in
literature
to
join
with
other
motives
in
inducing
me
to
come
more
frequently
before
the
public
that
emolument
is
the
voluntary
tax
which
the
public
pays
for
a
certain
species
of
literary
amusement
it
is
extorted
from
no
one
and
paid
i
presume
by
those
only
who
can
afford
it
and
who
receive
gratification
in
proportion
to
the
expense
if
the
capital
sum
which
these
volumes
have
put
into
circulation
be
a
very
large
one
has
it
contributed
to
my
indulgences
only
or
can
i
not
say
to
hundreds
from
honest
duncan
the
to
the
most
snivelling
of
the
printer
devils
didst
thou
not
share
hadst
thou
not
fifteen
pence
i
profess
i
think
our
modern
athens
much
obliged
to
me
for
having
established
such
an
extensive
manufacture
and
when
universal
suffrage
comes
in
fashion
i
intend
to
stand
for
a
seat
in
the
house
on
the
interest
of
all
the
unwashed
artificers
connected
with
literature
this
would
be
called
the
language
of
a
cant
again
my
dear
son
there
is
lime
in
this
sack
too
nothing
but
sophistication
in
this
world
i
do
say
it
in
spite
of
adam
smith
and
his
followers
that
a
successful
author
is
a
productive
labourer
and
that
his
works
constitute
as
effectual
a
part
of
the
public
wealth
as
that
which
is
created
by
any
other
manufacture
if
a
new
commodity
having
an
actually
intrinsic
and
commercial
value
be
the
result
of
the
operation
why
are
the
author
bales
of
books
to
be
esteemed
a
less
profitable
part
of
the
public
stock
than
the
goods
of
any
other
manufacturer
i
speak
with
reference
to
the
diffusion
of
the
wealth
arising
to
the
public
and
the
degree
of
industry
which
even
such
a
trifling
work
as
the
present
must
stimulate
and
reward
before
the
volumes
leave
the
publisher
shop
without
me
it
could
not
exist
and
to
this
extent
i
am
a
benefactor
to
the
country
as
for
my
own
emolument
it
is
won
by
my
toil
and
i
account
myself
answerable
to
heaven
only
for
the
mode
in
which
i
expend
it
the
candid
may
hope
it
is
not
all
dedicated
to
selfish
purposes
and
without
much
pretensions
to
merit
in
him
who
disburses
it
a
part
may
wander
to
the
yet
it
is
generally
held
base
to
write
from
the
mere
motives
of
gain
it
would
be
base
to
do
so
exclusively
or
even
to
make
it
a
principal
motive
for
literary
exertion
nay
i
will
venture
to
say
that
no
work
of
imagination
proceeding
from
the
mere
consideration
of
a
certain
sum
of
ever
did
or
ever
will
succeed
so
the
lawyer
who
pleads
the
soldier
who
fights
the
physician
who
prescribes
the
clergyman
if
such
there
be
who
preaches
without
any
zeal
for
his
profession
or
without
any
sense
of
its
dignity
and
merely
on
account
of
the
fee
pay
or
stipend
degrade
themselves
to
the
rank
of
sordid
mechanics
accordingly
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
learned
faculties
at
least
their
services
are
considered
as
unappreciable
and
are
acknowledged
not
by
any
exact
estimate
of
the
services
rendered
but
by
a
or
voluntary
acknowledgment
but
let
a
client
or
patient
make
the
experiment
of
omitting
this
little
ceremony
of
the
honorarium
which
is
to
be
a
thing
entirely
out
of
consideration
between
them
and
mark
how
the
learned
gentleman
will
look
upon
his
case
cant
set
apart
it
is
the
same
thing
with
literary
emolument
no
man
of
sense
in
any
rank
of
life
is
or
ought
to
be
above
accepting
a
just
recompense
for
his
time
and
a
reasonable
share
of
the
capital
which
owes
its
very
existence
to
his
exertions
when
czar
peter
wrought
in
the
trenches
he
took
the
pay
of
a
common
soldier
and
nobles
statesmen
and
divines
the
most
distinguished
of
their
time
have
not
scorned
to
square
accounts
with
their
bookseller
o
if
it
were
a
mean
thing
the
gentles
would
not
use
it
and
if
it
were
ungodly
the
clergy
would
refuse
you
say
well
but
no
man
of
honour
genius
or
spirit
would
make
the
mere
love
of
gain
the
chief
far
less
the
only
purpose
of
his
labours
for
myself
i
am
not
displeased
to
find
the
game
a
winning
one
yet
while
i
pleased
the
public
i
should
probably
continue
it
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
playing
for
i
have
felt
as
strongly
as
most
folks
that
love
of
composition
which
is
perhaps
the
strongest
of
all
instincts
driving
the
author
to
the
pen
the
painter
to
the
pallet
often
without
either
the
chance
of
fame
or
the
prospect
of
reward
perhaps
i
have
said
too
much
of
this
i
might
perhaps
with
as
much
truth
as
most
people
exculpate
myself
from
the
charge
of
being
either
of
a
greedy
or
mercenary
disposition
but
i
am
not
therefore
hypocrite
enough
to
disclaim
the
ordinary
motives
on
account
of
which
the
whole
world
around
me
is
toiling
unremittingly
to
the
sacrifice
of
ease
comfort
health
and
life
i
do
not
affect
the
disinterestedness
of
that
ingenious
association
of
gentlemen
mentioned
by
goldsmith
who
sold
their
magazine
for
sixpence
merely
for
their
own
amusement
i
have
but
one
thing
more
to
the
world
say
you
will
run
yourself
out
the
world
say
true
and
what
then
when
they
dance
no
longer
i
will
no
longer
pipe
and
i
shall
not
want
flappers
enough
to
remind
me
of
the
apoplexy
and
what
will
become
of
us
then
your
poor
family
we
shall
fall
into
contempt
and
oblivion
like
many
a
poor
fellow
already
overwhelmed
with
the
number
of
his
family
i
can
not
help
going
on
to
increase
it
is
my
vocation
such
of
you
as
deserve
oblivion
perhaps
the
whole
of
you
may
be
consigned
to
it
at
any
rate
you
have
been
read
in
your
day
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
some
of
your
contemporaries
of
less
fortune
and
more
merit
they
can
not
say
but
that
you
the
crown
it
is
always
something
to
have
engaged
the
public
attention
for
seven
years
had
i
only
written
waverley
i
should
have
long
since
been
according
to
the
established
phrase
the
ingenious
author
of
a
novel
much
admired
at
the
i
believe
on
my
soul
that
the
reputation
of
waverley
is
sustained
very
much
by
the
praises
of
those
who
may
be
inclined
to
prefer
that
tale
to
its
successors
you
are
willing
then
to
barter
future
reputation
for
present
popularity
meliora
horace
himself
expected
not
to
survive
in
all
his
works
i
may
hope
to
live
in
some
of
mine
omnis
it
is
some
consolation
to
reflect
that
the
best
authors
in
all
countries
have
been
the
most
voluminous
and
it
has
often
happened
that
those
who
have
been
best
received
in
their
own
time
have
also
continued
to
be
acceptable
to
posterity
i
do
not
think
so
ill
of
the
present
generation
as
to
suppose
that
its
present
favour
necessarily
infers
future
condemnation
were
all
to
act
on
such
principles
the
public
would
be
inundated
once
more
my
dear
son
beware
of
cant
you
speak
as
if
the
public
were
obliged
to
read
books
merely
because
they
are
printed
your
friends
the
booksellers
would
thank
you
to
make
the
proposition
good
the
most
serious
grievance
attending
such
inundations
as
you
talk
of
is
that
they
make
rags
dear
the
multiplicity
of
publications
does
the
present
age
no
harm
and
may
greatly
advantage
that
which
is
to
succeed
us
i
do
not
see
how
that
is
to
happen
the
complaints
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
and
james
of
the
alarming
fertility
of
the
press
were
as
loud
as
they
are
at
present
yet
look
at
the
shore
over
which
the
inundation
of
that
age
flowed
and
it
resembles
now
the
rich
strand
of
the
faery
queen
besrrew
all
with
rich
array
of
pearl
and
precious
stones
of
great
assay
and
all
the
gravel
mix
with
golden
believe
me
that
even
in
the
most
neglected
works
of
the
present
age
the
next
may
discover
treasures
some
books
will
defy
all
alchemy
they
will
be
but
few
in
number
since
as
for
the
writers
who
are
possessed
of
no
merit
at
all
unless
indeed
they
publish
their
works
at
their
own
expense
like
sir
richard
blackmore
their
power
of
annoying
the
public
will
be
soon
limited
by
the
difficulty
of
finding
undertaking
booksellers
you
are
incorrigible
are
there
no
bounds
to
your
audacity
there
are
the
sacred
and
eternal
boundaries
of
honour
and
virtue
my
course
is
like
the
enchanted
chamber
of
britomart
where
as
she
look
about
she
did
behold
how
over
that
same
door
was
likewise
writ
bold
be
bold
and
everywhere
whereat
she
mused
and
could
not
construe
it
at
last
she
spied
at
that
room
upper
end
another
iron
door
on
which
was
writ
be
not
too
well
you
must
take
the
risk
of
proceeding
on
your
own
principles
do
you
act
on
yours
and
take
care
you
do
not
stay
idling
here
till
the
dinner
hour
is
i
will
add
this
work
to
your
patrimony
here
our
dialogue
terminated
for
a
little
apollyon
from
the
canongate
came
to
demand
the
on
the
part
of
and
i
heard
rebuking
in
another
compartment
of
the
same
labyrinth
i
have
described
for
suffering
any
one
to
penetrate
so
far
into
the
of
their
temple
i
leave
it
to
you
to
form
your
own
opinion
concerning
the
import
of
this
dialogue
and
i
can
not
but
believe
i
shall
meet
the
wishes
of
our
common
parent
in
prefixing
this
letter
to
the
work
which
it
concerns
i
am
reverend
and
dear
sir
very
sincerely
and
affectionately
yours
the
fortunes
of
nigel
story
lord
bless
you
i
have
none
to
tell
sir
of
the
chapter
i
now
scot
and
english
are
agreed
and
saunders
hastes
to
cross
the
tweed
where
such
the
splendours
that
attend
him
his
very
mother
scarce
had
kend
him
his
metamorphosis
behold
from
glasgow
frieze
to
cloth
of
gold
his
with
the
iron
hilt
to
rapier
fairly
hatch
and
gilt
was
ever
seen
a
gallant
braver
his
very
bonnet
grown
a
beaver
the
hostilities
which
had
for
centuries
separated
the
south
and
the
north
divisions
of
the
island
of
britain
had
been
happily
terminated
by
the
succession
of
the
pacific
james
to
the
english
crown
but
although
the
united
crown
of
england
and
scotland
was
worn
by
the
same
individual
it
required
a
long
lapse
of
time
and
the
succession
of
more
than
one
generation
ere
the
inveterate
national
prejudices
which
had
so
long
existed
betwixt
the
sister
kingdoms
were
removed
and
the
subjects
of
either
side
of
the
tweed
brought
to
regard
those
upon
the
opposite
bank
as
friends
and
as
brethren
these
prejudices
were
of
course
most
inveterate
during
the
reign
of
king
james
the
english
subjects
accused
him
of
partiality
to
those
of
his
ancient
kingdom
while
the
scots
with
equal
injustice
charged
him
with
having
forgotten
the
land
of
his
nativity
and
with
neglecting
those
early
friends
to
whose
allegiance
he
had
been
so
much
indebted
the
temper
of
the
king
peaceable
even
to
timidity
inclined
him
perpetually
to
interfere
as
mediator
between
the
contending
factions
whose
brawls
disturbed
the
court
but
notwithstanding
all
his
precautions
historians
have
recorded
many
instances
where
the
mutual
hatred
of
two
nations
who
after
being
enemies
for
a
thousand
years
had
been
so
very
recently
united
broke
forth
with
a
fury
which
menaced
a
general
convulsion
and
spreading
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
classes
as
it
occasioned
debates
in
council
and
parliament
factions
in
the
court
and
duels
among
the
gentry
was
no
less
productive
of
riots
and
brawls
amongst
the
lower
orders
while
these
were
at
the
highest
there
flourished
in
the
city
of
london
an
ingenious
but
whimsical
and
self
opinioned
mechanic
much
devoted
to
abstract
studies
david
ramsay
by
name
who
whether
recommended
by
his
great
skill
in
his
profession
as
the
courtiers
alleged
or
as
was
murmured
among
the
neighbours
by
his
birthplace
in
the
good
town
of
dalkeith
near
edinburgh
held
in
james
household
the
post
of
maker
of
watches
and
horologes
to
his
majesty
he
scorned
not
however
to
keep
open
shop
within
temple
bar
a
few
yards
to
the
eastward
of
saint
dunstan
church
the
shop
of
a
london
tradesman
at
that
time
as
it
may
be
supposed
was
something
very
different
from
those
we
now
see
in
the
same
locality
the
goods
were
exposed
to
sale
in
cases
only
defended
from
the
weather
by
a
covering
of
canvass
and
the
whole
resembled
the
stalls
and
booths
now
erected
for
the
temporary
accommodation
of
dealers
at
a
country
fair
rather
than
the
established
emporium
of
a
respectable
citizen
but
most
of
the
shopkeepers
of
note
and
david
ramsay
amongst
others
had
their
booth
connected
with
a
small
apartment
which
opened
backward
from
it
and
bore
the
same
resemblance
to
the
front
shop
that
robinson
cavern
did
to
the
tent
which
he
erected
before
it
to
this
master
ramsay
was
often
accustomed
to
retreat
to
the
labour
of
his
abstruse
calculations
for
he
aimed
at
improvements
and
discoveries
in
his
own
art
and
sometimes
pushed
his
researches
like
napier
and
other
mathematicians
of
the
period
into
abstract
science
when
thus
engaged
he
left
the
outer
posts
of
his
commercial
establishment
to
be
maintained
by
two
and
apprentices
who
kept
up
the
cry
of
what
d
lack
what
d
lack
accompanied
with
the
appropriate
recommendations
of
the
articles
in
which
they
dealt
this
direct
and
personal
application
for
custom
to
those
who
chanced
to
pass
by
is
now
we
believe
limited
to
monmouth
street
if
it
still
exists
even
in
that
repository
of
ancient
garments
under
the
guardianship
of
the
scattered
remnant
of
israel
but
at
the
time
we
are
speaking
of
it
was
practised
alike
by
jew
and
gentile
and
served
instead
of
all
our
present
newspaper
puffs
and
advertisements
to
solicit
the
attention
of
the
public
in
general
and
of
friends
in
particular
to
the
unrivalled
excellence
of
the
goods
which
they
offered
to
sale
upon
such
easy
terms
that
it
might
fairly
appear
that
the
venders
had
rather
a
view
to
the
general
service
of
the
public
than
to
their
own
particular
advantage
the
verbal
proclaimers
of
the
excellence
of
their
commodities
had
this
advantage
over
those
who
in
the
present
day
use
the
public
papers
for
the
same
purpose
that
they
could
in
many
cases
adapt
their
address
to
the
peculiar
appearance
and
apparent
taste
of
the
passengers
this
as
we
have
said
was
also
the
case
in
monmouth
street
in
our
remembrance
we
have
ourselves
been
reminded
of
the
deficiencies
of
our
femoral
habiliments
and
exhorted
upon
that
score
to
fit
ourselves
more
beseemingly
but
this
is
a
digression
this
direct
and
personal
mode
of
invitation
to
customers
became
however
a
dangerous
temptation
to
the
young
wags
who
were
employed
in
the
task
of
solicitation
during
the
absence
of
the
principal
person
interested
in
the
traffic
and
confiding
in
their
numbers
and
civic
union
the
of
london
were
often
seduced
into
taking
liberties
with
the
passengers
and
exercising
their
wit
at
the
expense
of
those
whom
they
had
no
hopes
of
converting
into
customers
by
their
eloquence
if
this
were
resented
by
any
act
of
violence
the
inmates
of
each
shop
were
ready
to
pour
forth
in
succour
and
in
the
words
of
an
old
song
which
johnson
was
used
to
hum
up
then
rose
the
all
living
in
london
both
proper
and
desperate
riots
often
arose
on
such
occasions
especially
when
the
templars
or
other
youths
connected
with
the
aristocracy
were
insulted
or
conceived
themselves
to
be
so
upon
such
occasions
bare
steel
was
frequently
opposed
to
the
clubs
of
the
citizens
and
death
sometimes
ensued
on
both
sides
the
tardy
and
inefficient
police
of
the
time
had
no
other
resource
than
by
the
alderman
of
the
ward
calling
out
the
householders
and
putting
a
stop
to
the
strife
by
overpowering
numbers
as
the
capulets
and
montagues
are
separated
upon
the
stage
at
the
period
when
such
was
the
universal
custom
of
the
most
respectable
as
well
as
the
most
inconsiderable
shopkeepers
in
london
david
ramsay
on
the
evening
to
which
we
solicit
the
attention
of
the
reader
retiring
to
more
abstruse
and
private
labours
left
the
administration
of
his
outer
shop
or
booth
to
the
aforesaid
active
and
apprentices
namely
jenkin
vincent
and
frank
tunstall
vincent
had
been
educated
at
the
excellent
foundation
of
christ
church
hospital
and
was
bred
therefore
as
well
as
born
a
londoner
with
all
the
acuteness
address
and
audacity
which
belong
peculiarly
to
the
youth
of
a
metropolis
he
was
now
about
twenty
years
old
short
in
stature
but
remarkably
strong
made
eminent
for
his
feats
upon
holidays
at
and
other
gymnastic
exercises
scarce
rivalled
in
the
play
though
hitherto
only
exercised
in
the
form
of
he
knew
every
lane
blind
alley
and
sequestered
court
of
the
ward
better
than
his
catechism
was
alike
active
in
his
affairs
and
in
his
own
adventures
of
fun
and
mischief
and
so
managed
matters
that
the
credit
he
acquired
by
the
former
bore
him
out
or
at
least
served
for
his
apology
when
the
latter
propensity
led
him
into
scrapes
of
which
however
it
is
but
fair
to
state
that
they
had
hitherto
inferred
nothing
mean
or
discreditable
some
aberrations
there
were
which
david
ramsay
his
master
endeavoured
to
reduce
to
regular
order
when
he
discovered
them
and
others
which
he
winked
at
supposing
them
to
answer
the
purpose
of
the
escapement
of
a
watch
which
disposes
of
a
certain
quantity
of
the
extra
power
of
that
mechanical
impulse
which
puts
the
whole
in
motion
the
physiognomy
of
jin
vin
by
which
abbreviation
he
was
familiarly
known
through
the
ward
corresponded
with
the
sketch
we
have
given
of
his
character
his
head
upon
which
his
flat
cap
was
generally
flung
in
a
careless
and
oblique
fashion
was
closely
covered
with
thick
hair
of
raven
black
which
curled
naturally
and
closely
and
would
have
grown
to
great
length
but
for
the
modest
custom
enjoined
by
his
state
in
life
and
strictly
enforced
by
his
master
which
compelled
him
to
keep
it
not
unreluctantly
as
he
looked
with
envy
on
the
flowing
ringlets
in
which
the
courtiers
and
aristocratic
students
of
the
neighbouring
temple
began
to
indulge
themselves
as
marks
of
superiority
and
of
gentility
vincent
eyes
were
deep
set
in
his
head
of
a
strong
vivid
black
full
of
fire
roguery
and
intelligence
and
conveying
a
humorous
expression
even
while
he
was
uttering
the
usual
of
his
trade
as
if
he
ridiculed
those
who
were
disposed
to
give
any
weight
to
his
commonplaces
he
had
address
enough
however
to
add
little
touches
of
his
own
which
gave
a
turn
of
drollery
even
to
this
ordinary
routine
of
the
booth
and
the
alacrity
of
his
manner
his
ready
and
obvious
wish
to
oblige
his
intelligence
and
civility
when
he
thought
civility
necessary
made
him
a
universal
favourite
with
his
master
customers
his
features
were
far
from
regular
for
his
nose
was
flattish
his
mouth
tending
to
the
larger
size
and
his
complexion
inclining
to
be
more
dark
than
was
then
thought
consistent
with
masculine
beauty
but
in
despite
of
his
having
always
breathed
the
air
of
a
crowded
city
his
complexion
had
the
ruddy
and
manly
expression
of
redundant
health
his
nose
gave
an
air
of
spirit
and
raillery
to
what
he
said
and
seconded
the
laugh
of
his
eyes
and
his
wide
mouth
was
garnished
with
a
pair
of
and
lips
which
when
he
laughed
disclosed
a
range
of
teeth
strong
and
well
set
and
as
white
as
the
very
pearl
such
was
the
elder
apprentice
of
david
ramsay
memory
monitor
watchmaker
and
constructor
of
horologes
to
his
most
sacred
majesty
james
jenkin
companion
was
the
younger
apprentice
though
perhaps
he
might
be
the
elder
of
the
two
in
years
at
any
rate
he
was
of
a
much
more
staid
and
composed
temper
francis
tunstall
was
of
that
ancient
and
proud
descent
who
claimed
the
style
of
the
unstained
because
amid
the
various
chances
of
the
long
and
bloody
wars
of
the
roses
they
had
with
undeviating
faith
followed
the
house
of
lancaster
to
which
they
had
originally
attached
themselves
the
meanest
sprig
of
such
a
tree
attached
importance
to
the
root
from
which
it
derived
itself
and
tunstall
was
supposed
to
nourish
in
secret
a
proportion
of
that
family
pride
which
had
exhorted
tears
from
his
widowed
and
almost
indigent
mother
when
she
saw
herself
obliged
to
consign
him
to
a
line
of
life
inferior
as
her
prejudices
suggested
to
the
course
held
by
his
progenitors
yet
with
all
this
aristocratic
prejudice
his
master
found
the
youth
more
docile
regular
and
strictly
attentive
to
his
duty
than
his
far
more
active
and
alert
comrade
tunstall
also
gratified
his
master
by
the
particular
attention
which
he
seemed
disposed
to
bestow
on
the
abstract
principles
of
science
connected
with
the
trade
which
he
was
bound
to
study
the
limits
of
which
were
daily
enlarged
with
the
increase
of
mathematical
science
vincent
beat
his
companion
beyond
the
in
every
thing
like
the
practical
adaptation
of
thorough
practice
in
the
dexterity
of
hand
necessary
to
execute
the
mechanical
branches
of
the
art
and
him
in
all
respecting
the
commercial
affairs
of
the
shop
still
david
ramsay
was
wont
to
say
that
if
vincent
knew
how
to
do
a
thing
the
better
of
the
two
tunstall
was
much
better
acquainted
with
the
principles
on
which
it
ought
to
be
done
and
he
sometimes
objected
to
the
latter
that
he
knew
critical
excellence
too
well
ever
to
be
satisfied
with
practical
mediocrity
the
disposition
of
tunstall
was
shy
as
well
as
studious
and
though
perfectly
civil
and
obliging
he
never
seemed
to
feel
himself
in
his
place
while
he
went
through
the
duties
of
the
shop
he
was
tall
and
handsome
with
fair
hair
and
limbs
good
features
eyes
a
straight
grecian
nose
and
a
countenance
which
expressed
both
and
intelligence
but
qualified
by
a
gravity
unsuitable
to
his
years
and
which
almost
amounted
to
dejection
he
lived
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
companion
and
readily
stood
by
him
whenever
he
was
engaged
in
any
of
the
frequent
skirmishes
which
as
we
have
already
observed
often
disturbed
the
city
of
london
about
this
period
but
though
tunstall
was
allowed
to
understand
the
weapon
of
the
north
country
in
a
superior
degree
and
though
he
was
naturally
both
strong
and
active
his
interference
in
such
affrays
seemed
always
matter
of
necessity
and
as
he
never
voluntarily
joined
either
their
brawls
or
their
sports
he
held
a
far
lower
place
in
the
opinion
of
the
youth
of
the
ward
than
his
hearty
and
active
friend
jin
vin
nay
had
it
not
been
for
the
interest
made
for
his
comrade
by
the
intercession
of
vincent
tunstall
would
have
stood
some
chance
of
being
altogether
excluded
from
the
society
of
his
contemporaries
of
the
same
condition
who
called
him
in
scorn
the
cavaliero
cuddy
and
the
gentle
tunstall
on
the
other
hand
the
lad
himself
deprived
of
the
fresh
air
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
foregoing
the
exercise
to
which
he
had
formerly
been
accustomed
while
the
inhabitant
of
his
native
mansion
lost
gradually
the
freshness
of
his
complexion
and
without
showing
any
formal
symptoms
of
disease
grew
more
thin
and
pale
as
he
grew
older
and
at
length
exhibited
the
appearance
of
indifferent
health
without
any
thing
of
the
habits
and
complaints
of
an
invalid
excepting
a
disposition
to
avoid
society
and
to
spend
his
leisure
time
in
private
study
rather
than
mingle
in
the
sports
of
his
companions
or
even
resort
to
the
theatres
then
the
general
rendezvous
of
his
class
where
according
to
high
authority
they
fought
for
apples
cracked
nuts
and
filled
the
upper
gallery
with
their
clamours
such
were
the
two
youths
who
called
david
ramsay
master
and
with
both
of
whom
he
used
to
fret
from
morning
till
night
as
their
peculiarities
interfered
with
his
own
or
with
the
quiet
and
beneficial
course
of
his
traffic
upon
the
whole
however
the
youths
were
attached
to
their
master
and
he
a
though
an
absent
and
whimsical
man
was
scarce
less
so
to
them
and
when
a
little
warmed
with
wine
at
an
occasional
junketing
he
used
to
boast
in
his
northern
dialect
of
his
twa
bonnie
lads
and
the
looks
that
the
court
ladies
threw
at
them
when
visiting
his
shop
in
their
caroches
when
on
a
frolic
into
the
but
david
ramsay
never
failed
at
the
same
time
to
draw
up
his
own
tall
thin
lathy
skeleton
extend
his
lean
jaws
into
an
alarming
grin
and
indicate
by
a
nod
of
his
visage
and
a
twinkle
of
his
little
grey
eye
that
there
might
be
more
faces
in
fleet
street
worth
looking
at
than
those
of
frank
and
jenkin
his
old
neighbour
widow
simmons
the
sempstress
who
had
served
in
her
day
the
very
revellers
of
the
temple
with
ruffs
cuffs
and
bands
distinguished
more
deeply
the
sort
of
attention
paid
by
the
females
of
quality
who
so
regularly
visited
david
ramsay
shop
to
its
inmates
the
boy
frank
she
admitted
used
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
young
ladies
as
having
something
gentle
and
downcast
in
his
looks
but
then
he
could
not
better
himself
for
the
poor
youth
had
not
a
word
to
throw
at
a
dog
now
jin
vin
was
so
full
of
his
jibes
and
jeers
and
so
willing
and
so
ready
and
so
serviceable
and
so
mannerly
all
the
while
with
a
step
that
sprung
like
a
buck
in
epping
forest
and
his
eye
that
twinkled
as
black
as
a
gipsy
that
no
woman
who
knew
the
world
would
make
a
comparison
betwixt
the
lads
as
for
poor
neighbour
ramsay
himself
the
man
she
said
was
a
civil
neighbour
and
a
learned
man
doubtless
and
might
be
a
rich
man
if
he
had
common
sense
to
back
his
learning
and
doubtless
for
a
scot
neighbour
ramsay
was
nothing
of
a
bad
man
but
he
was
so
constantly
grimed
with
smoke
gilded
with
brass
filings
and
smeared
with
and
oil
that
dame
simmons
judged
it
would
require
his
whole
shopful
of
watches
to
induce
any
feasible
woman
to
touch
the
said
neighbour
ramsay
with
any
thing
save
a
pair
of
a
still
higher
authority
dame
ursula
wife
to
benjamin
suddlechop
the
barber
was
of
exactly
the
same
opinion
such
were
in
natural
qualities
and
public
estimation
the
two
youths
who
in
a
fine
april
day
having
first
rendered
their
dutiful
service
and
attendance
on
the
table
of
their
master
and
his
daughter
at
their
dinner
at
one
such
o
ye
lads
of
london
was
the
severe
discipline
undergone
by
your
predecessors
and
having
regaled
themselves
upon
the
fragments
in
company
with
two
female
domestics
one
a
cook
and
maid
of
all
work
the
other
called
mistress
margaret
maid
now
relieved
their
master
in
the
duty
of
the
outward
shop
and
agreeably
to
the
established
custom
were
soliciting
by
their
entreaties
and
recommendations
of
their
master
manufacture
the
attention
and
encouragement
of
the
passengers
in
this
species
of
service
it
may
be
easily
supposed
that
jenkin
vincent
left
his
more
reserved
and
bashful
comrade
far
in
the
background
the
latter
could
only
articulate
with
difficulty
and
as
an
act
of
duty
which
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
discharging
the
established
words
of
form
what

what

what

but
this
dull
and
dry
iteration
however
varied
by
diversity
of
verbal
arrangement
sounded
flat
when
mingled
with
the
rich
and
recommendatory
oratory
of
the
and
jenkin
what

noble
sir
what

he
said
in
a
tone
at
once
bold
and
soothing
which
often
was
so
applied
as
both
to
gratify
the
persons

to
excite
a

said
jenkin
producing
a
pair
of
spectacles
which
he
touched
with
an
air
of
great
deference
and
respect
which
his
most
blessed
majesty
placed
this
day
three
weeks
on
his
own
blessed
nose
and
would
have
kept
them
for
his
own
sacred
use
but
that
the
setting
being
as
your
reverence
sees
of
the
purest

was
as
his
sacred
majesty
was
pleased
to
say
fitter
for
a

than
for

our

then
pulled
out
his
purse
paid
for
the
spectacles
and
left
the
shop
with
even
a
more
important
step
than
that
which
had
paused
to
enter
it
for
shame
said
tunstall
to
his
companion

not

a

the

stood
at

door
in
his
flat
cap
and
canvass
sleeves
with
a
large
wooden
pestle
in

took
up

the

had
given
full

to
the

of
this

of

halting
his

grimly

the

the

tossing
his

who
valued

the

now
rang
along
fleet

and
jenkin
snatching
up
his

which
lay
beneath
the
counter
ready
at

notice
and
calling
to

his

as

he
could
but
with
more
attention
to
the

and
convenience
of

while
old
david

with

uplifted
a
green
apron
before
him

a
glass

he
had
been
polishing
thrust
into
his

came
forth
to
look
after
the
safety
of

by

about

unwilling

here
the
vexed
philosopher
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
grave
citizen
of
a
most
respectable
appearance
who
saluting
him
familiarly
by
the
name
of
davie
my
old
acquaintance
demanded
what
had
put
him
so
much
out
of
sorts
and
gave
him
at
the
same
time
a
cordial
grasp
of
his
hand
the
stranger
dress
was
though
grave
rather
richer
than
usual
his
paned
hose
were
of
black
velvet
lined
with
purple
silk
which
garniture
appeared
at
the
slashes
his
doublet
was
of
purple
cloth
and
his
short
cloak
of
black
velvet
to
correspond
with
his
hose
and
both
were
adorned
with
a
great
number
of
small
silver
buttons
richly
wrought
in
filigree
a
triple
chain
of
gold
hung
round
his
neck
and
in
place
of
a
sword
or
dagger
he
wore
at
his
belt
an
ordinary
knife
for
the
purpose
of
the
table
with
a
small
silver
case
which
appeared
to
contain
writing
materials
he
might
have
seemed
some
secretary
or
clerk
engaged
in
the
service
of
the
public
only
that
his
low
flat
and
unadorned
cap
and
his
shining
shoes
indicated
that
he
belonged
to
the
city
he
was
a
man
about
the
middle
size
and
seemed
in
firm
health
though
advanced
in
years
his
looks
expressed
sagacity
and
and
the
air
of
respectability
which
his
dress
announced
was
well
supported
by
his
clear
eye
ruddy
cheek
and
grey
hair
he
used
the
scottish
idiom
in
his
first
address
but
in
such
a
manner
that
it
could
hardly
be
distinguished
whether
he
was
passing
upon
his
friend
a
sort
of
jocose
mockery
or
whether
it
was
his
own
native
dialect
for
his
ordinary
discourse
had
little
provincialism
in
answer
to
the
queries
of
his
respectable
friend
ramsay
groaned
heavily
answering
by
echoing
back
the
question
what
ails
me
master
george
why
every
thing
ails
me
i
profess
to
you
that
a
man
may
as
well
live
in
fairyland
as
in
the
ward
of
my
apprentices
are
turned
into
mere
goblins
they
appear
and
disappear
like
spunkies
and
have
no
more
regularity
in
them
than
a
watch
without
a
scapement
if
there
is
a
ball
to
be
tossed
up
or
a
bullock
to
be
driven
mad
or
a
quean
to
be
ducked
for
scolding
or
a
head
to
be
broken
jenkin
is
sure
to
be
at
the
one
end
or
the
other
of
it
and
then
away
skips
francis
tunstall
for
company
i
think
the
and
mountebanks
are
in
a
league
against
me
my
dear
friend
and
that
they
pass
my
house
ten
times
for
any
other
in
the
city
here
an
italian
fellow
come
over
too
that
they
call
punchinello
and
altogether
well
interrupted
master
george
but
what
is
all
this
to
the
present
case
why
replied
ramsay
here
has
been
a
cry
of
thieves
or
murder
i
hope
that
will
prove
the
least
of
it
amongst
these
english
swine
and
i
have
been
interrupted
in
the
deepest
calculation
ever
mortal
man
plunged
into
master
what
man
replied
master
george
you
must
take
patience
you
are
a
man
that
deals
in
time
and
can
make
it
go
fast
and
slow
at
pleasure
you
of
all
the
world
have
least
reason
to
complain
if
a
little
of
it
be
lost
now
and
but
here
come
your
boys
and
bringing
in
a
slain
man
betwixt
them
i
think
here
has
been
serious
mischief
i
am
the
more
mischief
the
better
sport
said
the
crabbed
old
watchmaker
i
am
blithe
though
that
it
neither
of
the
twa
loons
what
are
ye
bringing
a
corpse
here
for
ye
fause
villains
he
added
addressing
the
two
apprentices
who
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
mob
of
their
own
class
some
of
whom
bore
evident
marks
of
a
recent
fray
were
carrying
the
body
betwixt
them
he
is
not
dead
yet
sir
answered
tunstall
carry
him
into
the
apothecary
then
replied
his
master
d
think
i
can
set
a
man
life
in
motion
again
as
if
he
were
a
clock
or
a
timepiece
for
godsake
old
friend
said
his
acquaintance
let
us
have
him
here
at
the
nearest
he
seems
only
in
a
a
swoon
said
ramsay
and
what
business
had
he
to
swoon
in
the
streets
only
if
it
will
oblige
my
friend
master
george
i
would
take
in
all
the
dead
men
in
dunstan
parish
call
sam
porter
to
look
after
the
so
saying
the
stunned
man
being
the
identical
scotsman
who
had
passed
a
short
time
before
amidst
the
jeers
of
the
apprentices
was
carried
into
the
back
shop
of
the
artist
and
there
placed
in
an
armed
chair
till
the
apothecary
from
over
the
way
came
to
his
assistance
this
gentleman
as
sometimes
happens
to
those
of
the
learned
professions
had
rather
more
lore
than
knowledge
and
began
to
talk
of
the
sinciput
and
occiput
and
cerebrum
and
cerebellum
until
he
exhausted
david
ramsay
brief
stock
of
patience
he
repeated
with
great
indignation
what
signify
all
the
bells
in
london
if
you
do
not
put
a
plaster
on
the
child
crown
master
george
with
zeal
asked
the
apothecary
whether
bleeding
might
not
be
useful
when
after
humming
and
hawing
for
a
moment
and
being
unable
upon
the
spur
of
the
occasion
to
suggest
any
thing
else
the
man
of
pharmacy
observed
that
it
would
at
all
events
relieve
the
brain
or
cerebrum
in
case
there
was
a
tendency
to
the
depositation
of
any
extravasated
blood
to
operate
as
a
pressure
upon
that
delicate
organ
fortunately
he
was
adequate
to
performing
this
operation
and
being
powerfully
aided
by
jenkin
vincent
who
was
learned
in
all
cases
of
broken
heads
with
plenty
of
cold
water
and
a
little
vinegar
applied
according
to
the
scientific
method
practised
by
the
in
a
modern
ring
the
man
began
to
raise
himself
on
his
chair
draw
his
cloak
tightly
around
him
and
look
about
like
one
who
struggles
to
recover
sense
and
recollection
he
had
better
lie
down
on
the
bed
in
the
little
back
closet
said
ramsay
visitor
who
seemed
perfectly
familiar
with
the
accommodations
which
the
house
afforded
he
is
welcome
to
my
share
of
the
truckle
said
jenkin
for
in
the
said
back
closet
were
the
two
apprentices
accommodated
in
one
i
can
sleep
under
the
so
can
i
said
tunstall
and
the
poor
fellow
can
have
the
bed
all
sleep
said
the
apothecary
is
in
the
opinion
of
galen
a
restorative
and
febrifuge
and
is
most
naturally
taken
in
a
where
a
better
can
not
be
come
by
said
master
george
but
these
are
two
honest
lads
to
give
up
their
beds
so
willingly
come
off
with
his
cloak
and
let
us
bear
him
to
his
couch
i
will
send
for
irving
the
king
chirurgeon
he
does
not
live
far
off
and
that
shall
be
my
share
of
the
samaritan
duty
neighbour
well
sir
said
the
apothecary
it
is
at
your
pleasure
to
send
for
other
advice
and
i
shall
not
object
to
consult
with
irving
or
any
other
medical
person
of
skill
neither
to
continue
to
furnish
such
drugs
as
may
be
needful
from
my
pharmacopeia
however
whatever
irving
who
i
think
hath
had
his
degrees
in
edinburgh
or
be
he
scottish
or
english
may
say
to
the
contrary
sleep
taken
timeously
is
a
febrifuge
or
sedative
and
also
a
he
muttered
a
few
more
learned
words
and
concluded
by
informing
ramsay
friend
in
english
far
more
intelligible
than
his
latin
that
he
would
look
to
him
as
his
paymaster
for
medicines
care
and
attendance
furnished
or
to
be
furnished
to
this
party
unknown
master
george
only
replied
by
desiring
him
to
send
his
bill
for
what
he
had
already
to
charge
and
to
give
himself
no
farther
trouble
unless
he
heard
from
him
the
pharmacopolist
who
from
discoveries
made
by
the
cloak
falling
a
little
aside
had
no
great
opinion
of
the
faculty
of
this
chance
patient
to
make
reimbursement
had
no
sooner
seen
his
case
espoused
by
a
substantial
citizen
than
he
showed
some
reluctance
to
quit
possession
of
it
and
it
needed
a
short
and
stern
hint
from
master
george
which
with
all
his
he
was
capable
of
expressing
when
occasion
required
to
send
to
his
own
dwelling
this
esculapius
of
temple
bar
when
they
were
rid
of
raredrench
the
charitable
efforts
of
jenkin
and
francis
to
divest
the
patient
of
his
long
grey
cloak
were
firmly
resisted
on
his
own
my
life
suner
my
life
suner
he
muttered
in
indistinct
murmurs
in
these
efforts
to
retain
his
upper
garment
which
was
too
tender
to
resist
much
handling
it
gave
way
at
length
with
a
loud
rent
which
almost
threw
the
patient
into
a
second
syncope
and
he
sat
before
them
in
his
under
garments
the
looped
and
repaired
wretchedness
of
which
moved
at
once
pity
and
laughter
and
had
certainly
been
the
cause
of
his
unwillingness
to
resign
the
mantle
which
like
the
virtue
of
charity
served
to
cover
so
many
imperfections
the
man
himself
cast
his
eyes
on
his
garb
and
seemed
so
much
ashamed
of
the
disclosure
that
muttering
between
his
teeth
that
he
would
be
too
late
for
his
appointment
he
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
leave
the
shop
which
was
easily
prevented
by
jenkin
vincent
and
his
comrade
who
at
the
nod
of
master
george
laid
hold
of
and
detained
him
in
his
chair
the
patient
next
looked
round
him
for
a
moment
and
then
said
faintly
in
his
broad
northern
language
what
sort
of
usage
ca
ye
this
gentlemen
to
a
stranger
a
sojourner
in
your
town
ye
hae
broken
my
head
ye
hae
riven
my
cloak
and
now
ye
are
for
restraining
my
personal
liberty
they
were
wiser
than
me
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
that
counselled
me
to
wear
my
warst
claithing
in
the
streets
of
london
and
if
i
could
have
got
ony
things
warse
than
these
mean
garments
which
would
have
been
very
difficult
said
jin
vin
in
a
whisper
to
his
companion
they
would
have
been
ower
gude
for
the
grips
o
men
sae
little
acquented
with
the
laws
of
honest
to
say
the
truth
said
jenkin
unable
to
forbear
any
longer
although
the
discipline
of
the
times
prescribed
to
those
in
his
situation
a
degree
of
respectful
distance
and
humility
in
the
presence
of
parents
masters
or
seniors
of
which
the
present
age
has
no
idea
to
say
the
truth
the
good
gentleman
clothes
look
as
if
they
would
not
brook
much
hold
your
peace
young
man
said
master
george
with
a
tone
of
authority
never
mock
the
stranger
or
the
poor
the
black
ox
has
not
trod
on
your
foot
yet
you
know
not
what
lands
you
may
travel
in
or
what
clothes
you
may
wear
before
you
vincent
held
down
his
head
and
stood
rebuked
but
the
stranger
did
not
accept
the
apology
which
was
made
for
him
i
a
stranger
sir
said
he
that
is
certain
though
methinks
that
being
such
i
have
been
somewhat
familiarly
treated
in
this
town
of
yours
but
as
for
my
being
poor
i
think
i
need
not
be
charged
with
poverty
till
i
seek
siller
of
the
dear
country
all
over
said
master
george
in
a
whisper
to
david
ramsay
pride
and
but
david
had
taken
out
his
tablets
and
silver
pen
and
deeply
immersed
in
calculations
in
which
he
rambled
over
all
the
terms
of
arithmetic
from
the
simple
unit
to
millions
billions
and
trillions
neither
heard
nor
answered
the
observation
of
his
friend
who
seeing
his
abstraction
turned
again
to
the
scot
i
fancy
now
jockey
if
a
stranger
were
to
offer
you
a
noble
you
would
chuck
it
back
at
his
head
not
if
i
could
do
him
honest
service
for
it
sir
said
the
scot
i
am
willing
to

whispered
vincent
to
his
companion

out
with

continued
master
george
observing
that
the
scot
as
usual
with
his
countrymen
when
asked
a
blunt
straightforward
question
took
a
little
time
before
answering
it
i
am
no
more
jockey
sir
than
you
are
john
said
the
stranger
as
if
offended
at
being
addressed
by
a
name
which
at
that
time
was
used
as
sawney
now
is
for
a
general
appellative
of
the
scottish
nation

old
and
honourable
house
of

kend
at
the
of
what
is
that

proceeded
the
interrogator
why
an
it
like
your
honour
said
richie
who
now
having
recovered
his
senses
sufficiently
to
observe
the
respectable
exterior
of
master
george
threw
more
civility
into
his
manner
than
at
first
the
is
a
gate
of
our
city
as
yonder
brick
arches
at
whitehall
form
the
entrance
of
the
king
palace
here
only
that
the
is
of
stonern
work
and
mair
decorated
with
architecture
and
the
policy
of
nouns
man
the
whitehall
gateways
were
planned
by
the
great
holbein
answered
master
george
i
suspect
your
accident
has
jumbled
your
brains
my
good
friend
i
suppose
you
will
tell
me
next
you
have
at
edinburgh
as
fine
a
navigable
river
as
the
thames
with
all
its
shipping
the
thames
exclaimed
richie
in
a
tone
of
ineffable
contempt
god
bless
your
honour
judgment
we
have
at
edinburgh
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
gusedub
ye
fause
loon
answered
master
george
speaking
scotch
with
a
strong
and
natural
emphasis
it
is
such
as
you
that
with
your
falset
and
fair
fashions
bring
reproach
on
our
whole
god
forgie
me
sir
said
richie
much
surprised
at
finding
the
supposed
southron
converted
into
a
native
scot
i
took
your
honour
for
an
englisher
but
i
hope
there
was
naething
wrang
in
standing
up
for
ane
ain
country
credit
in
a
strange
land
where
all
men
cry
her
down
do
you
call
it
for
your
country
credit
to
show
that
she
has
a
lying
puffing
rascal
for
one
of
her
children
said
master
george
but
come
man
never
look
grave
on
it
as
you
have
found
a
countryman
so
you
have
found
a
friend
if
you
deserve
one
and
especially
if
you
answer
me
i
see
nae
gude
it
wad
do
me
to
speak
ought
else
but
truth
said
the
worthy
north
briton
well
then
to
begin
said
master
george
i
suspect
you
are
a
son
of
old
mungo
moniplies
the
flesher
at
the
your
honour
is
a
witch
i
think
said
richie
grinning
and
how
dared
you
sir
to
uphold
him
for
a
noble
i
dinna
ken
sir
said
richie
scratching
his
head
i
hear
muckle
of
an
earl
of
warwick
in
these
southern
parts
guy
i
think
his
name
was
and
he
has
great
reputation
here
for
slaying
dun
cows
and
boars
and
such
like
and
i
am
sure
my
father
has
killed
more
cows
and
boars
not
to
mention
bulls
calves
sheep
ewes
lambs
and
pigs
than
the
haill
baronage
of
go
to
you
are
a
shrewd
knave
said
master
george
charm
your
tongue
and
take
care
of
saucy
answers
your
father
was
an
honest
burgher
and
the
deacon
of
his
craft
i
am
sorry
to
see
his
son
in
so
poor
a
indifferent
sir
said
richie
moniplies
looking
down
on
his
garments
very
indifferent
but
it
is
the
wonted
livery
of
poor
burghers
sons
in
our
country
one
of
luckie
want
bestowing
upon
us
rest
us
patient
the
king
leaving
scotland
has
taken
all
custom
frae
edinburgh
and
there
is
hay
made
at
the
cross
and
a
dainty
crop
of
fouats
in
the

is
as
much
grass
grows
where
my
father
stall
stood
as
might
have
been
a
good
bite
for
the
beasts
he
was
used
to
it
is
even
too
true
said
master
george
and
while
we
make
fortunes
here
our
old
neighbours
and
their
families
are
starving
at
home
this
should
be
thought
upon
and
how

that
broken
head

moniplies

behoved

i
got
the
lick
that
donnerit
me
from

george
looked
to
the
apprentices
as
if
to
demand
the
truth
of
this
story
it
is
just
as
he
says
sir
replied
jenkin
only
i
heard
nothing
about
the
people
said
he
had
broke
some
crockery
and
that
i
beg
pardon
sir
nobody
could
thrive
within
the
kenning
of

well
no

what
they
said

the
weaker

said
george
hast

beldam
whom

our
heels
to
by

so
that
you
see
sir
i
hold
in
a
sort
of
black

it
in
our
country
being
the
servant
of

what

your
master
name
said
master
george
and
observing
that
richie
hesitated
he
added
nay

not
tell
me
if
it
is
a
a
secret
that
there
is
little
use
in
keeping
said
richie
only
ye
ken
that
our
northern
stomachs
are
ower
proud
to
call
in
witnesses
to
our
distress
no
that
my
master
is
in
mair
than
present
pinch
sir
he
added
looking
towards
the
two
english
apprentices
having
a
large
sum
in
the
royal
treasury
that
is
he
continued
in
a
whisper
to
master
george
the
king

owing
him
a
lot
of
siller
but
it
ill
getting
at
it
it
my
master

of
the

a
condition
troth
and
i
am
all
the
followers

i
be
if

muckle
better
aff
than
i
am
though
i
were
to
bide
as
i
i
have
seen
his
father
with
four
gentlemen
and
ten
lackeys
at
his
heels
said
master
george
rustling
in
their
laces
and
velvets
well
this
is
a
changeful
world
but
there
is
a
better
beyond
the
good
old
house
of
glenvarloch
that
stood
by
king
and
country
five
hundred
years
your
honour
may
say
a
thousand
said
the
follower
i
will
say
what

said
the
citizen
and
not
a
word
you
seem
well
recovered
now

you
walk
bravely
sir

clour

stot
where

replied
the
scot
in
a
sma
house
at
the
fit
of
ane
of
the
wynds
that
gang
down
to
the
with
a
decent
man
john
christie
a
as
they
his
father
came
from
dundee
i
wotna
the
name
of
the
wynd
but
it
right
anent
the
mickle
kirk
yonder
and
your
honour
will
mind
that
we
pass
only
by
our
of
simple
nigel
olifaunt
as
keeping
ourselves
retired
for
the
present
though
in
scotland
we
be
called
the
lord
it
is
wisely
done
of
your
master
said
the
citizen
i
will
find
out
your
lodgings
though
your
direction
be
none
of
the
so
saying
and
slipping
a
piece
of
money
at
the
same
time
into
richie
moniplies
hand
he
bade
him
hasten
home
and
get
into
no
more
affrays
i
will
take
care
of
that
now
sir
said
richie
with
a
look
of
importance
having
a
charge
about
me
and
so
wussing
ye
a
weel
with
special
thanks
to
these
twa
young
gentlemen
i
am
no
gentleman
said
jenkin
flinging
his
cap
on
his
head
i
am
a
tight
london
and
hope
to
be
a
freeman
one
day
frank
may
write
himself
gentleman
if
he
i
a
gentleman
once
said
tunstall
and
i
hope
i
have
done
nothing
to
lose
the
name
of
weel
weel
as
ye
list
said
richie
moniplies
but
i
am
mickle
beholden
to
ye
baith
and
i
am
not
a
hair
the
less
like
to
bear
it
in
mind
that
i
say
but
little
about
it
just
to
you
my
kind
so
saying
he
thrust
out
of
the
sleeve
of
his
ragged
doublet
a
long
bony
hand
and
arm
on
which
the
muscles
rose
like
master
george
shook
it
heartily
while
jenkin
and
frank
exchanged
sly
looks
with
each
other
richie
moniplies
would
next
have
addressed
his
thanks
to
the
master
of
the
shop
but
seeing
him
as
he
afterwards
said
scribbling
on
his
bit
bookie
as
if
he
were
demented
he
contented
his
politeness
with
giving
him
a
hat
touching
that
is
his
bonnet
in
token
of
salutation
and
so
left
the
shop
now
there
goes
scotch
jockey
with
all
his
bad
and
good
about
him
said
master
george
to
master
david
who
suspended
though
unwillingly
the
calculations
with
which
he
was
engaged
and
keeping
his
pen
within
an
inch
of
the
tablets
gazed
on
his
friend
with
great
eyes
which
expressed
any
thing
rather
than
intelligence
or
interest
in
the
discourse
addressed
to
that
fellow
proceeded
master
george
without
heeding
his
friend
state
of
abstraction
shows
with
great
liveliness
of
colouring
how
our
scotch
pride
and
poverty
make
liars
and
braggarts
of
us
and
yet
the
knave
whose
every
third
word
to
an
englishman
is
a
boastful
lie
will
i
warrant
you
be
a
true
and
tender
friend
and
follower
to
his
master
and
has
perhaps
parted
with
his
mantle
to
him
in
the
cold
blast
although
he
himself
walked
cuerpo
as
the
don
strange
that
courage
and
fidelity
for
i
will
warrant
that
the
knave
is
stout
should
have
no
better
companion
than
this
swaggering
braggadocio
but
you
mark
me
not
friend
i
do
i
do
most
heedfully
said
for
as
the
sun
goeth
round
the
in
hours
add
for
the
moon
fifty
minutes
and
a
half
you
are
in
the
seventh
heavens
man
said
his
companion
i
crave
your
pardon
replied
let
the
wheel
a
go
round
in
hours
i
have
it
and
the
wheel
b
in
hours
fifty
minutes
and
a
half
being
to
as
to
hours
fifty
minutes
and
a
half
or
very
nearly
i
crave
your
forgiveness
master
george
and
heartily
wish
you
said
master
george
why
you
have
not
wished
me
yet
come
old
friend
lay
by
these
tablets
or
you
will
crack
the
inner
machinery
of
skull
as
our
friend
yonder
has
got
the
of
his
quotha
i
mean
not
to
part
with
you
so
easily
i
came
to
get
my
four
hours
nunchion
from
you
man
besides
a
tune
on
the
lute
from
my
good
faith
i
was
abstracted
master
george
but
you
know
me
whenever
i
get
amongst
the
wheels
said
ramsay
why
is
lucky
that
you
deal
in
small
ones
said
his
friend
as
awakened
from
his
reveries
and
calculations
ramsay
led
the
way
up
a
little
to
the
first
storey
occupied
by
his
daughter
and
his
little
household
the
apprentices
resumed
their
places
in
the
and
relieved
sam
porter
when
jenkin
said
to
tunstall
didst
see
frank
how
the
old
goldsmith
cottoned
in
with
his
beggarly
countryman
when
would
one
of
his
wealth
have
shaken
hands
so
courteously
with
a
poor
englishman
well
i
say
that
for
the
best
of
the
scots
that
they
will
go
over
head
and
ears
to
serve
a
countryman
when
they
will
not
wet
a
nail
of
their
finger
to
save
a
southron
as
they
call
us
from
drowning
and
yet
master
george
is
but
scot
neither
in
that
respect
for
i
have
known
him
do
many
a
kind
thing
to
the
english
but
hark
ye
jenkin
said
tunstall
i
think
you
are
but
english
yourself
how
came
you
to
strike
on
the
scotsman
side
after
all
why
you
did
so
too
answered
vincent
ay
because
i
saw
you
begin
and
besides
it
is
no
cumberland
fashion
to
fall
fifty
upon
one
replied
tunstall
and
no
christ
church
fashion
neither
said
jenkin
fair
play
and
old
england
for
ever
besides
to
tell
you
a
secret
his
voice
had
a
twang
in
it
in
the
dialect
i
mean
reminded
me
of
a
little
tongue
which
i
think
sweeter
sweeter
than
the
last
toll
of
dunstan
will
sound
on
the
day
that
i
am
shot
of
my
indentures
ha
you
guess
who
i
mean
frank
not
i
indeed
answered
scotch
janet
i
suppose
the
off
with
janet
in
her
own
no
no
no
you
blind
buzzard
do
you
not
know
i
mean
pretty
marget
umph
answered
tunstall
dryly
a
flash
of
anger
not
unmingled
with
suspicion
shot
from
jenkin
keen
black
eyes
umph
and
what
signifies
umph
i
am
not
the
first
has
married
his
master
daughter
i
suppose
they
kept
their
own
secret
i
fancy
said
tunstall
at
least
till
they
were
out
of
their
i
tell
you
what
it
is
frank
answered
jenkin
sharply
that
may
be
the
fashion
of
you
gentlefolks
that
are
taught
from
your
biggin
to
carry
two
faces
under
the
same
hood
but
it
shall
never
be
there
are
the
stairs
then
said
tunstall
coolly
go
up
and
ask
marget
of
our
master
just
now
and
see
what
sort
of
a
face
he
will
wear
under
no
i
wonnot
answered
jenkin
i
am
not
such
a
fool
as
that
neither
but
i
will
take
my
own
time
and
all
the
counts
in
cumberland
shall
not
cut
my
comb
and
this
is
that
which
you
may
depend
francis
made
no
reply
and
they
resumed
their
usual
attention
to
the
business
of
the
shop
and
their
usual
solicitations
to
the
passengers

i
pray
you

no

who
i
sir
lord

the
next
morning
found
nigel
olifaunt
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
seated
sad
and
solitary
in
his
little
apartment
in
the
mansion
of
john
christie
the
which
that
honest
tradesman
in
gratitude
perhaps
to
the
profession
from
which
he
derived
his
chief
support
appeared
to
have
constructed
as
nearly
as
possible
upon
the
plan
of
a
ship
cabin
it
was
situated
near
to
paul
wharf
at
the
end
of
one
of
those
intricate
and
narrow
lanes
which
until
that
part
of
the
city
was
swept
away
by
the
great
fire
in
constituted
an
extraordinary
labyrinth
of
small
dark
damp
and
unwholesome
streets
and
alleys
in
one
corner
or
other
of
which
the
plague
was
then
as
surely
found
lurking
as
in
the
obscure
corners
of
constantinople
in
our
own
time
but
john
house
looked
out
upon
the
river
and
had
the
advantage
therefore
of
free
air
impregnated
however
with
the
odoriferous
fumes
of
the
articles
in
which
the
dealt
with
the
odour
of
pitch
and
the
natural
scent
of
the
ooze
and
sludge
left
by
the
reflux
of
the
tide
upon
the
whole
except
that
his
dwelling
did
not
float
with
the
and
become
stranded
with
the
ebb
the
young
lord
was
nearly
as
comfortably
accommodated
as
he
was
while
on
board
the
little
trading
brig
from
the
long
town
of
kirkaldy
in
fife
by
which
he
had
come
a
passenger
to
london
he
received
however
every
attention
which
could
be
paid
him
by
his
honest
landlord
john
christie
for
richie
moniplies
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
preserve
his
master
so
completely
but
that
the
honest
could
form
a
guess
that
his
guest
quality
was
superior
to
his
appearance
as
for
dame
nelly
his
wife
a
round
buxom
dame
with
black
eyes
a
tight
bodice
a
green
apron
and
a
red
petticoat
edged
with
a
slight
silver
lace
and
judiciously
shortened
so
as
to
show
that
a
short
heel
and
a
tight
clean
ankle
rested
upon
her
shoe
she
of
course
felt
interest
in
a
young
man
who
besides
being
very
handsome
and
easily
satisfied
with
the
accommodations
her
house
afforded
was
evidently
of
a
rank
as
well
as
manners
highly
superior
to
the
skippers
or
captains
as
they
called
themselves
of
merchant
vessels
who
were
the
usual
tenants
of
the
apartments
which
she
let
to
hire
and
at
whose
departure
she
was
sure
to
find
her
floor
soiled
with
the
relics
of
tobacco
which
spite
of
king
james
counterblast
was
then
forcing
itself
into
use
and
her
best
curtains
impregnated
with
the
odour
of
geneva
and
strong
waters
to
dame
nelly
great
indignation
for
as
she
truly
said
the
smell
of
the
shop
and
warehouse
was
bad
enough
without
these
additions
but
all
olifaunt
habits
were
regular
and
cleanly
and
his
address
though
frank
and
simple
showed
so
much
of
the
courtier
and
gentleman
as
formed
a
strong
contrast
with
the
loud
halloo
coarse
jests
and
boisterous
impatience
of
her
maritime
inmates
dame
nelly
saw
that
her
guest
was
melancholy
also
notwithstanding
his
efforts
to
seem
contented
and
cheerful
and
in
short
she
took
that
sort
of
interest
in
him
without
being
herself
aware
of
the
extent
which
an
unscrupulous
gallant
might
have
been
tempted
to
improve
to
the
prejudice
of
honest
john
who
was
at
least
a
score
of
years
older
than
his
helpmate
olifaunt
however
had
not
only
other
matters
to
think
of
but
would
have
regarded
such
an
intrigue
had
the
idea
ever
occurred
to
him
as
an
abominable
and
ungrateful
encroachment
upon
the
laws
of
hospitality
his
religion
having
been
by
his
late
father
formed
upon
the
strict
principles
of
the
national
faith
and
his
morality
upon
those
of
the
nicest
honour
he
had
not
escaped
the
predominant
weakness
of
his
country
an
overweening
sense
of
the
pride
of
birth
and
a
disposition
to
value
the
worth
and
consequence
of
others
according
to
the
number
and
the
fame
of
their
deceased
ancestors
but
this
pride
of
family
was
well
subdued
and
in
general
almost
entirely
concealed
by
his
good
sense
and
general
courtesy
such
as
we
have
described
him
nigel
olifaunt
or
rather
the
young
lord
glenvarloch
was
when
our
narrative
takes
him
up
under
great
perplexity
respecting
the
fate
of
his
trusty
and
only
follower
richard
moniplies
who
had
been
dispatched
by
his
young
master
early
the
preceding
morning
as
far
as
the
court
at
westminster
but
had
not
yet
returned
his
evening
adventures
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
and
so
far
knows
more
of
richie
than
did
his
master
who
had
not
heard
of
him
for
hours
dame
nelly
christie
in
the
meantime
regarded
her
guest
with
some
anxiety
and
a
great
desire
to
comfort
him
if
possible
she
placed
on
the
a
noble
piece
of
cold
powdered
beef
with
its
usual
guards
of
turnip
and
carrot
recommended
her
mustard
as
coming
direct
from
her
cousin
at
tewkesbury
and
spiced
the
toast
with
her
own
hands
and
with
her
own
hands
also
drew
a
jug
of
stout
and
nappy
ale
all
of
which
were
elements
of
the
substantial
breakfast
of
the
period
when
she
saw
that
her
guest
anxiety
prevented
him
from
doing
justice
to
the
good
cheer
which
she
set
before
him
she
commenced
her
career
of
verbal
consolation
with
the
usual
volubility
of
those
women
in
her
station
who
conscious
of
good
looks
good
intentions
and
good
lungs
entertain
no
fear
either
of
wearying
themselves
or
of
fatiguing
their
auditors
now
what
the
good
year
are
we
to
send
you
down
to
scotland
as
thin
as
you
came
up
i
am
sure
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
course
of
nature
there
was
my
goodman
father
old
sandie
christie
i
have
heard
he
was
an
atomy
when
he
came
up
from
the
north
and
i
am
sure
he
died
saint
barnaby
was
ten
years
at
twenty
stone
weight
i
was
a
girl
at
the
time
and
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
though
i
had
little
thought
of
marrying
john
then
who
had
a
score
of
years
the
better
of
me
but
he
is
a
thriving
man
and
a
kind
husband
and
his
father
as
i
was
saying
died
as
fat
as
a
well
sir
but
i
hope
i
have
not
offended
you
for
my
little
joke
and
i
hope
the
ale
is
to
your
liking
and
the
beef
and
the
mustard
all
excellent
all
too
good
answered
olifaunt
you
have
every
thing
so
clean
and
tidy
dame
that
i
shall
not
know
how
to
live
when
i
go
back
to
my
own
country
if
ever
i
go
back
this
was
added
as
it
seemed
involuntarily
and
with
a
deep
sigh
i
warrant
your
honour
go
back
again
if
you
like
it
said
the
dame
unless
you
think
rather
of
taking
a
pretty
english
lady
as
some
of
your
countryfolk
have
done
i
assure
you
some
of
the
best
of
the
city
have
married
scotsmen
there
was
lady
trebleplumb
sir
thomas
trebleplumb
the
great
turkey
merchant
widow
married
sir
awley
macauley
whom
your
honour
knows
doubtless
and
pretty
mistress
doublefee
old
sergeant
doublefee
daughter
jumped
out
of
window
and
was
married
at
to
a
scotsman
with
a
hard
name
and
old
pitchpost
the
timber
merchant
daughters
did
little
better
for
they
married
two
irishmen
and
when
folks
jeer
me
about
having
a
scotsman
for
lodger
meaning
your
honour
i
tell
them
they
are
afraid
of
their
daughters
and
their
mistresses
and
sure
i
have
a
right
to
stand
up
for
the
scots
since
john
christie
is
half
a
scotsman
and
a
thriving
man
and
a
good
husband
though
there
is
a
score
of
years
between
us
and
so
i
would
have
your
honour
cast
care
away
and
mend
your
breakfast
with
a
morsel
and
a
at
a
word
my
kind
hostess
i
can
not
said
olifaunt
i
am
anxious
about
this
knave
of
mine
who
has
been
so
long
absent
in
this
dangerous
town
of
it
may
be
noticed
in
passing
that
dame
nelly
ordinary
mode
of
consolation
was
to
disprove
the
existence
of
any
cause
for
distress
and
she
is
said
to
have
carried
this
so
far
as
to
comfort
a
neighbour
who
had
lost
her
husband
with
the
assurance
that
the
dear
defunct
would
be
better
which
perhaps
might
not
have
proved
an
appropriate
even
if
it
had
been
a
possible
mode
of
relief
on
this
occasion
she
denied
stoutly
that
richie
had
been
absent
altogether
twenty
hours
and
as
for
people
being
killed
in
the
streets
of
london
to
be
sure
two
men
had
been
found
in
last
week
but
that
was
far
to
the
east
and
the
other
poor
man
that
had
his
throat
cut
in
the
fields
had
met
his
mishap
near
by
islington
and
he
that
was
stabbed
by
the
young
templar
in
a
drunken
frolic
by
saint
in
the
strand
was
an
irishman
all
which
evidence
she
produced
to
show
that
none
of
these
casualties
had
occurred
in
a
case
exactly
parallel
with
that
of
richie
a
scotsman
and
on
his
return
from
westminster
my
better
comfort
is
my
good
dame
answered
olifaunt
that
the
lad
is
no
brawler
or
quarreller
unless
strongly
urged
and
that
he
has
nothing
valuable
about
him
to
any
one
but
your
honour
speaks
very
well
retorted
the
inexhaustible
hostess
who
protracted
her
task
of
taking
away
and
putting
to
rights
in
order
that
she
might
prolong
her
gossip
i
uphold
master
moniplies
to
be
neither
reveller
nor
brawler
for
if
he
liked
such
things
he
might
be
visiting
and
junketing
with
the
young
folks
about
here
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
never
dreams
of
it
and
when
i
asked
the
young
man
to
go
as
far
as
my
gossip
dame
drinkwater
to
taste
a
glass
of
aniseed
and
a
bit
of
the
groaning
cheese
for
dame
drinkwater
has
had
twins
as
i
told
your
honour
sir
and
i
meant
it
quite
civilly
to
the
young
man
but
he
chose
to
sit
and
keep
house
with
john
christie
and
i
dare
say
there
is
a
score
of
years
between
them
for
your
servant
looks
scarce
much
older
than
i
am
i
wonder
what
they
could
have
to
say
to
each
other
i
asked
john
christie
but
he
bid
me
go
to
if
he
comes
not
soon
said
his
master
i
will
thank
you
to
tell
me
what
magistrate
i
can
address
myself
to
for
besides
my
anxiety
for
the
poor
fellow
safety
he
has
papers
of
importance
about
o
your
honour
may
be
assured
he
will
be
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
dame
nelly
he
is
not
the
lad
to
stay
out
hours
at
a
stretch
and
for
the
papers
i
am
sure
your
honour
will
pardon
him
for
just
giving
me
a
peep
at
the
corner
as
i
was
giving
him
a
small
cup
not
so
large
as
my
thimble
of
distilled
waters
to
fortify
his
stomach
against
the
damps
and
it
was
directed
to
the
king
most
excellent
majesty
and
so
doubtless
his
majesty
has
kept
richie
out
of
civility
to
consider
of
your
honour
letter
and
send
back
a
fitting
dame
nelly
here
hit
by
chance
on
a
more
available
topic
of
consolation
than
those
she
had
hitherto
touched
upon
for
the
youthful
lord
had
himself
some
vague
hopes
that
his
messenger
might
have
been
delayed
at
court
until
a
fitting
and
favourable
answer
should
be
dispatched
back
to
him
inexperienced
however
in
public
affairs
as
he
certainly
was
it
required
only
a
moment
consideration
to
convince
him
of
the
improbability
of
an
expectation
so
contrary
to
all
he
had
heard
of
etiquette
as
well
as
the
dilatory
proceedings
in
a
court
suit
and
he
answered
the
hostess
with
a
sigh
that
he
doubted
whether
the
king
would
even
look
on
the
paper
addressed
to
him
far
less
take
it
into
his
immediate
consideration
now
out
upon
you
for
a
gentleman
said
the
good
dame
and
why
should
he
not
do
as
much
for
us
as
our
gracious
queen
elizabeth
many
people
say
this
and
that
about
a
queen
and
a
king
but
i
think
a
king
comes
more
natural
to
us
english
folks
and
this
good
gentleman
goes
as
often
down
by
water
to
greenwich
and
employs
as
many
of
the
and
of
all
kinds
and
maintains
in
his
royal
grace
john
taylor
the
who
keeps
both
a
sculler
and
a
pair
of
oars
and
he
has
made
a
comely
court
at
whitehall
just
by
the
river
and
since
the
king
is
so
good
a
friend
to
the
thames
i
can
not
see
if
it
please
your
honour
why
all
his
subjects
and
your
honour
in
specialty
should
not
have
satisfaction
by
his
true
dame
true
let
us
hope
for
the
best
but
i
must
take
my
cloak
and
rapier
and
pray
your
husband
in
courtesy
to
teach
me
the
way
to
a
sure
sir
said
the
prompt
dame
i
can
do
that
as
well
as
he
who
has
been
a
slow
man
of
his
tongue
all
his
life
though
i
will
give
him
his
due
for
being
a
loving
husband
and
a
man
as
well
to
pass
in
the
world
as
any
betwixt
us
and
the
top
of
the
lane
and
so
there
is
the
sitting
alderman
that
is
always
at
the
guildhall
which
is
close
by
paul
and
so
i
warrant
you
he
puts
all
to
rights
in
the
city
that
wisdom
can
mend
and
for
the
rest
there
is
no
help
but
patience
but
i
wish
i
were
as
sure
of
forty
pounds
as
i
am
that
the
young
man
will
come
back
safe
and
olifaunt
in
great
and
anxious
doubt
of
what
the
good
dame
so
strongly
averred
flung
his
cloak
on
one
shoulder
and
was
about
to
belt
on
his
rapier
when
first
the
voice
of
richie
moniplies
on
the
stair
and
then
that
faithful
emissary
appearance
in
the
chamber
put
the
matter
beyond
question
dame
nelly
after
congratulating
moniplies
on
his
return
and
paying
several
compliments
to
her
own
sagacity
for
having
foretold
it
was
at
length
pleased
to
leave
the
apartment
the
truth
was
that
besides
some
instinctive
feelings
of
good
breeding
which
combated
her
curiosity
she
saw
there
was
no
chance
of
proceeding
in
his
narrative
while
she
was
in
the
room
and
she
therefore
retreated
trusting
that
her
own
address
would
get
the
secret
out
of
one
or
other
of
the
young
men
when
she
should
have
either
by
himself
now
in
heaven
name
what
is
the
matter
said
nigel
where
have
you
been
or
what
have
you
been
about
you
look
as
pale
as
death
there
is
blood
on
your
hand
and
your
clothes
are
torn
what

you
been
at

have
been
drunk
richard

richard
in
a
small
way
but
for
being
drunk
that
a
job
ill
to
manage
in
this
town
without
money
to
come
by
liquor
and
as
for
the
deil
a
thing
broken
but
my
head

a

a

misleard
rascals

my
country
but
i
think
i
cleared
the
causey
of
them
however
the
haill
hive

ower
mony
for
me
at
last
and
i
got
this
eclipse

then
i

were
reasonably
civil

the

the
churchyard
said
nigel
but
i
need
not
ask
what
drove
you
to
such
a
it
wasna
sae
much
the
want
o
siller
my
lord
nigel
said
richie
with
an
air
of
mysterious
importance
for
i
was
no
sae
absolute
without
means
of
whilk
mair
anon
but
i
thought
i
wad
never
ware
a
saxpence
sterling
on
ane
of
their
saucy
chamberlains
at
a
hostelry
sae
lang
as
i
could
sleep
fresh
and
fine
in
a
fair
dry
spring
night
mony
a
time
when
i
hae
come
hame
ower
late
and
faund
the
steekit
and
the
waiter
i
have
garr
the
sexton
of
saint
cuthbert
serve
me
for
my
quarters
but
then
there
are
dainty
green
graffs
in
saint
cuthbert
kirkyard
whare
ane
may
sleep
as
if
they
were
in
a
till
they
hear
the
lavrock
singing
up
in
the
air
as
high
as
the
castle
whereas
and
behold
these
london
kirkyards
are
causeyed
with
panged
hard
and
fast
thegither
and
my
cloak
being
something
threadbare
made
but
a
thin
mattress
so
i
was
fain
to
give
up
my
bed
before
every
limb
about
me
was
crippled
dead
folks
may
sleep
yonder
sound
enow
but
deil
haet
and
what
became
of
you
next
said
his
master
i
just
took
to
a
canny
bulkhead
as
they
ca
them
here
that
is
the
boards
on
the
tap
of
their
bits
of
outshots
of
stalls
and
booths
and
there
i
sleepit
as
sound
as
if
i
was
in
a
castle
not
but
i
was
disturbed
with
some
of
the
queans
and
swaggering
billies
but
when
they
found
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
me
but
a
slash
of
my
andrew
ferrara
they
bid
me
for
a
beggarly
scot
and
i
was
weel
pleased
to
be
sae
cheap
rid
of
them
and
in
the
morning
i
cam
daikering
here
but
sad
wark
i
had
to
find
the
way
for
i
had
been
east
as
far
as
the
place
they
ca
though
it
is
mair
like
well
richie
answered
nigel
i
am
glad
all
this
has
ended
so
well
go
get
something
to
eat
i
am
sure
you
need
in
troth
do
i
sir
replied
moniplies
but
with
your
leave
forget
the
lordship
for
the
present
richie
as
i
have
often
told
you
faith
replied
richie
i
could
weel
forget
that
your
honour
was
a
lord
but
then
i
behoved
to
forget
that
i
am
a
lord
man
and
not
so
easy
but
however
he
added
assisting
his
description
with
the
thumb
and
the
two
forefingers
of
his
right
hand
thrust
out
after
the
fashion
of
a
bird
claw
while
the
little
finger
and
were
closed
upon
the
palm
to
the
court
i
went
and
my
friend
that
promised
me
a
sight
of
his
majesty
most
gracious
presence
was
as
gude
as
his
word
and
carried
me
into
the
back
offices
where
i
got
the
best
breakfast
i
have
had
since
we
came
here
and
it
did
me
gude
for
the
rest
of
the
day
for
as
to
what
i
have
eaten
in
this
accursed
town
it
is
aye
sauced
with
the
disquieting
thought
that
it
maun
be
paid
for
after
a
there
was
but
beef
banes
and
fat
brose
but
king
cauff
your
honour
kens
is
better
than
ither
folk
corn
at
ony
rate
it
was
a
in
free
but
i
see
he
added
stopping
short
that
your
honour
waxes
by
no
means
richie
said
the
young
nobleman
with
an
air
of
resignation
for
he
well
knew
his
domestic
would
not
mend
his
pace
for
goading
you
have
suffered
enough
in
the
embassy
to
have
a
right
to
tell
the
story
in
your
own
way
only
let
me
pray
for
the
name
of
the
friend
who
was
to
introduce
you
into
the
king
presence
you
were
very
mysterious
on
the
subject
when
you
undertook
through
his
means
to
have
the
supplication
put
into
his
majesty
own
hands
since
those
sent
heretofore
i
have
every
reason
to
think
went
no
farther
than
his
weel
my
lord
said
richie
i
did
not
tell
you
his
name
and
quality
at
first
because
i
thought
you
would
be
affronted
at
the
like
of
him
having
to
do
in
your
lordship
affairs
but
mony
a
man
climbs
up
in
court
by
waur
help
it
was
just
laurie
linklater
one
of
the
yeomen
of
the
kitchen
that
was
my
father
apprentice
lang
a
yeoman
in
the
kitchen
a
scullion
exclaimed
lord
nigel
pacing
the
room
in
displeasure
but
consider
sir
said
richie
composedly
that
a
your
great
friends
hung
back
and
shunned
to
own
you
or
to
advocate
your
petition
and
then
though
i
am
sure
i
wish
laurie
a
higher
office
for
your
lordship
sake
and
for
mine
and
specially
for
his
ain
sake
being
a
friendly
lad
yet
your
lordship
must
consider
that
a
scullion
if
a
yeoman
of
the
king
most
royal
kitchen
may
be
called
a
scullion
may
weel
rank
with
a
elsewhere
being
that
king
cauff
as
i
said
before
is
better
than
you
are
right
and
i
was
wrong
said
the
young
nobleman
i
have
no
choice
of
means
of
making
my
case
known
so
that
they
be
laurie
is
as
honest
a
lad
as
ever
lifted
a
ladle
said
richie
not
but
what
i
dare
to
say
he
can
lick
his
fingers
like
other
folk
and
reason
good
but
in
fine
for
i
see
your
honour
is
waxing
impatient
he
brought
me
to
the
palace
where
a
was
astir
for
the
king
going
out
to
hunt
or
hawk
on
blackheath
i
think
they
ca
it
and
there
was
a
horse
stood
with
all
the
quarries
about
it
a
bonny
grey
as
ever
was
foaled
and
the
saddle
and
the
stirrups
and
the
curb
and
bit
o
burning
gowd
or
silver
gilded
at
least
and
down
sir
came
the
king
with
all
his
nobles
dressed
out
in
his
of
green
doubly
laced
and
laid
down
with
gowd
i
minded
the
very
face
o
him
though
it
was
lang
since
i
saw
him
but
my
certie
lad
thought
i
times
are
changed
since
ye
came
fleeing
down
the
back
stairs
of
auld
holyrood
house
in
grit
fear
having
your
breeks
in
your
hand
without
time
to
put
them
on
and
frank
stewart
the
wild
earl
of
bothwell
hard
at
your
haunches
and
if
auld
lord
glenvarloch
hadna
cast
his
mantle
about
his
arm
and
taken
bluidy
wounds
mair
than
ane
in
your
behalf
you
wald
not
have
craw
sae
crouse
this
day
and
so
saying
i
could
not
but
think
your
sifflication
could
not
be
less
than
most
acceptable
and
so
i
banged
in
among
the
crowd
of
lords
laurie
thought
me
mad
and
held
me
by
the
till
the
cloth
rave
in
his
hand
and
so
i
banged
in
right
before
the
king
just
as
he
mounted
and
crammed
the
sifflication
into
his
hand
and
he
opened
it
like
in
amaze
and
just
as
he
saw
the
first
line
i
was
minded
to
make
a
reverence
and
i
had
the
ill
luck
to
hit
his
jaud
o
a
beast
on
the
nose
with
my
hat
and
scaur
the
creature
and
she
swarved
aside
and
the
king
that
sits
na
mickle
better
than
a
on
the
saddle
was
like
to
have
gotten
a
clean
coup
and
that
might
have
cost
my
craig
a
he
flung
down
the
paper
amang
the
beast
feet
and
cried
wi
the
fause
loon
that
brought
it
and
they
grippit
me
and
cried
treason
and
i
thought
of
the
ruthvens
that
were
dirked
in
their
ain
house
for
it
may
be
as
small
a
forfeit
however
they
spak
only
of
scourging
me
and
had
me
away
to
the
lodge
to
try
the
tawse
on
my
back
and
i
was
crying
mercy
as
loud
as
i
could
and
the
king
when
he
had
righted
himself
on
the
saddle
and
gathered
his
breath
cried
to
do
me
nae
harm
for
said
he
he
is
ane
of
our
ain
norland
stots
i
ken
by
the
rowt
of
him
and
they
laughed
and
rowted
loud
eneugh
and
then
he
said
him
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
and
let
him
go
down
to
the
north
by
the
next
light
collier
before
waur
come
so
they
let
me
go
and
rode
out
a
sniggering
laughing
and
rounding
in
ilk
ither
lugs
a
sair
life
i
had
wi
laurie
linklater
for
he
said
it
wad
be
the
ruin
of
him
and
then
when
i
told
him
it
was
in
your
matter
he
said
if
he
had
known
before
he
would
have
risked
a
scauding
for
you
because
he
minded
the
brave
old
lord
your
father
and
then
he
showed
how
i
suld
have
done
and
that
i
suld
have
held
up
my
hand
to
my
brow
as
if
the
grandeur
of
the
king
and
his
thegither
had
casten
the
glaiks
in
my
een
and
mair
jackanape
tricks
i
suld
hae
played
instead
of
offering
the
sifflication
he
said
as
if
i
had
been
bringing
guts
to
a
footnote
i
am
certain
this
prudential
advice
is
not
original
on
linklater
part
but
i
am
not
at
present
able
to
produce
my
authority
i
think
it
amounted
to
this
that
james
flung
down
a
petition
presented
by
some
supplicant
who
paid
no
compliments
to
his
horse
and
expressed
no
admiration
at
the
splendour
of
his
furniture
saying
shall
a
king
cumber
himself
about
the
petition
of
a
beggar
while
the
beggar
disregards
the
king
splendour
it
is
i
think
sir
john
harrington
who
recommends
as
a
sure
mode
to
the
king
favour
to
praise
the
paces
of
the
royal
palfrey
said
he
the
king
is
a
and
just
man
of
his
ain
kindly
nature
but
he
has
a
wheen
maggots
that
maun
be
cannily
guided
and
then
richie
says
he
in
a
very
laigh
tone
would
tell
it
to
nane
but
a
wise
man
like
yoursell
but
the
king
has
them
about
him
wad
corrupt
an
angel
from
heaven
but
i
could
have
you
avisement
how
to
have
guided
him
but
now
it
like
after
meat
mustard
aweel
laurie
said
i
may
be
as
you
say
but
since
i
am
clear
of
the
tawse
and
the
porter
lodge
sifflicate
wha
like
deil
hae
richie
moniplies
if
he
come
sifflicating
here
again
and
so
away
i
came
and
i
wasna
far
by
the
temple
port
or
bar
or
whatever
they
ca
it
when
i
met
with
the
misadventure
that
i
tauld
you
of
well
my
honest
richie
said
lord
nigel
your
attempt
was
well
meant
and
not
so
ill
conducted
i
think
as
to
have
deserved
so
bad
an
issue
but
go
to
your
beef
and
mustard
and
we
talk
of
the
rest
there
is
nae
mair
to
be
spoken
sir
said
his
follower
except
that
i
met
ane
very
honest
gentleman
or
rather
burgher
as
i
think
that
was
in
the
whigmaleery
man
and
when
he
learned
wha
i
was
behold
he
was
a
kindly
scot
himsell
and
what
is
more
a
o
the
gude
town
and
he
behoved
to
compel
me
to
take
this
portugal
piece
to
drink
forsooth
my
certie
thought
i
we
ken
better
for
we
will
eat
it
and
he
spoke
of
paying
your
lordship
a
you
did
not
tell
him
where
i
lived
you
knave
said
the
lord
nigel
angrily
i
shall
have
every
clownish
burgher
from
edinburgh
come
to
gaze
on
my
distress
and
pay
a
shilling
for
having
seen
the
motion
of
the
poor
noble
tell
him
where
you
lived
said
richie
evading
the
question
how
could
i
tell
him
what
i
kendna
mysell
if
i
had
minded
the
name
of
the
wynd
i
need
not
have
slept
in
the
kirkyard
see
then
that
you
give
no
one
notice
of
our
lodging
said
the
young
nobleman
those
with
whom
i
have
business
i
can
meet
at
paul
or
in
the
court
of
this
is
steeking
the
when
the
steed
is
stolen
thought
richie
to
himself
but
i
must
put
him
on
another
so
thinking
he
asked
the
young
lord
what
was
in
the
proclamation
which
he
still
held
folded
in
his
hand
for
having
little
time
to
spell
at
it
said
he
your
lordship
well
knows
i
ken
nought
about
it
but
the
grand
blazon
at
the
tap
the
lion
has
gotten
a
claught
of
our
auld
scottish
shield
now
but
it
was
as
weel
upheld
when
it
had
a
unicorn
on
ilk
side
of
lord
nigel
read
the
proclamation
and
he
coloured
deep
with
shame
and
indignation
as
he
read
for
the
purport
was
to
his
injured
feelings
like
the
pouring
of
ardent
spirits
upon
a
recent
wound
what
deil
in
the
paper
my
lord
said
richie
unable
to
suppress
his
curiosity
as
he
observed
his
master
change
colour
i
wadna
ask
such
a
thing
only
the
proclamation
is
not
a
private
thing
but
is
meant
for
men
it
is
indeed
meant
for
all
men
hearing
replied
lord
nigel
and
it
proclaims
the
shame
of
our
country
and
the
ingratitude
of
our
now
the
lord
preserve
us
and
to
publish
it
in
london
too
ejaculated
moniplies
hark
ye
richard
said
nigel
olifaunt
in
this
paper
the
lords
of
the
council
set
forth
that
consideration
of
the
resort
of
idle
persons
of
low
condition
forth
from
his
majesty
kingdom
of
scotland
to
his
english
court
filling
the
same
with
their
suits
and
supplications
and
dishonouring
the
royal
presence
with
their
base
poor
and
beggarly
persons
to
the
disgrace
of
their
country
in
the
estimation
of
the
english
these
are
to
prohibit
the
skippers
masters
of
vessels
and
others
in
every
part
of
scotland
from
bringing
such
miserable
creatures
up
to
court
under
pain
of
fine
and
i
marle
the
skipper
took
us
on
board
said
richie
then
you
need
not
marvel
how
you
are
to
get
back
again
said
lord
nigel
for
here
is
a
clause
which
says
that
such
idle
suitors
are
to
be
transported
back
to
scotland
at
his
majesty
expense
and
punished
for
their
audacity
with
stripes
stocking
or
incarceration
according
to
their
demerits
that
is
to
say
i
suppose
according
to
the
degree
of
their
poverty
for
i
see
no
other
demerit
this
will
scarcely
said
richie
square
with
our
old
proverb
a
king
face
should
give
grace
but
what
says
the
paper
farther
my
lord
o
only
a
small
clause
which
especially
concerns
us
making
some
still
heavier
denunciations
against
those
suitors
who
shall
be
so
bold
as
to
approach
the
court
under
pretext
of
seeking
payment
of
old
debts
due
to
them
by
the
king
which
the
paper
states
is
of
all
species
of
importunity
that
which
is
most
odious
to
his
the
king
has
neighbours
in
that
matter
said
richie
but
it
is
not
every
one
that
can
shift
off
that
sort
of
cattle
so
easily
as
he
their
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
knocking
at
the
door
olifaunt
looked
out
at
the
window
and
saw
an
elderly
respectable
person
whom
he
knew
not
richie
also
peeped
and
recognised
but
recognising
chose
not
to
acknowledge
his
friend
of
the
preceding
evening
afraid
that
his
share
in
the
visit
might
be
detected
he
made
his
escape
out
of
the
apartment
under
pretext
of
going
to
his
breakfast
and
left
their
landlady
the
task
of
ushering
master
george
into
lord
nigel
apartment
which
she
performed
with
much
courtesy

those
of
the
higher
ranks
are
sometimes
willing
to
make
a
plebeian
sensible
that
he
is
an
intruder
but
master
george
seemed
neither
displeased
nor
disconcerted
he
assumed
the
chair
which
in
deference
to
his
respectable
appearance
lord
nigel
offered
to
him
and
said
after
a
moment
pause
during
which
he
had
looked
attentively
at
the
young
man
with
respect
not
unmingled
with
emotion
you
will
forgive
me
for
this
rudeness
my
lord
but
i
was
endeavouring
to
trace
in
your
youthful
countenance
the
features
of
my
good
old
lord
your
excellent
there
was
a
moment
pause
ere
young
glenvarloch
replied
still
with
a
reserved
manner
i
have
been
reckoned
like
my
father
sir
and
am
happy
to
see
any
one
that
respects
his
memory
but
the
business
which
calls
me
to
this
city
is
of
a
hasty
as
well
as
a
private
nature
and
i
understand
the
hint
my
lord
said
master
george
and
would
not
be
guilty
of
long
detaining
you
from
business
or
more
agreeable
conversation
my
errand
is
almost
done
when
i
have
said
that
my
name
is
george
heriot
warmly
befriended
and
introduced
into
the
employment
of
the
royal
family
of
scotland
more
than
twenty
years
since
by
your
excellent
father
and
that
learning
from
a
follower
of
yours
that
your
lordship
was
in
this
city
in
prosecution
of
some
business
of
importance
it
is
my
duty
it
is
my
pleasure
to
wait
on
the
son
of
my
respected
patron
and
as
i
am
somewhat
known
both
at
the
court
and
in
the
city
to
offer
him
such
aid
in
the
furthering
of
his
affairs
as
my
credit
and
experience
may
be
able
to
i
have
no
doubt
of
either
master
heriot
said
lord
nigel
and
i
thank
you
heartily
for
the
with
which
you
have
placed
them
at
a
stranger
disposal
but
my
business
at
court
is
done
and
ended
and
i
intend
to
leave
london
and
indeed
the
island
for
foreign
travel
and
military
service
i
may
add
that
the
suddenness
of
my
departure
occasions
my
having
little
time
at
my
master
heriot
did
not
take
the
hint
but
sat
fast
with
an
embarrassed
countenance
however
like
one
who
had
something
to
say
that
he
knew
not
exactly
how
to
make
effectual
at
length
he
said
with
a
dubious
smile
you
are
fortunate
my
lord
in
having
so
soon
dispatched
your
business
at
court
your
talking
landlady
informs
me
you
have
been
but
a
fortnight
in
this
city
it
is
usually
months
and
years
ere
the
court
and
a
suitor
shake
hands
and
my
business
said
lord
nigel
with
a
brevity
which
was
intended
to
stop
further
discussion
was
summarily
still
master
heriot
remained
seated
and
there
was
a
cordial
added
to
the
reverence
of
his
appearance
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
lord
nigel
to
be
more
explicit
in
requesting
his
absence
your
lordship
has
not
yet
had
time
said
the
citizen
still
attempting
to
sustain
the
conversation
to
visit
the
places
of
amusement
the
playhouses
and
other
places
to
which
youth
resort
but
i
see
in
your
lordship
hand
one
of
the
plots
of
the
piece
footnote
meaning
probably
playbills
which
they
hand
about
of
late
may
i
ask
what
play
oh
a
piece
said
lord
nigel
impatiently
throwing
down
the
proclamation
which
he
had
hitherto
been
twisting
to
and
fro
in
his
hand
an
excellent
and
piece
new
way
to
pay
old
master
heriot
stooped
down
saying
ah
my
old
acquaintance
philip
massinger
but
having
opened
the
paper
and
seen
the
purport
he
looked
at
lord
nigel
with
surprise
saying
i
trust
your
lordship
does
not
think
this
prohibition
can
extend
either
to
person
or
your
claims
i
should
scarce
have
thought
so
myself
said
the
young
nobleman
but
so
it
proves
his
majesty
to
close
this
discourse
at
once
has
been
pleased
to
send
me
this
proclamation
in
answer
to
a
respectful
supplication
for
the
repayment
of
large
loans
advanced
by
my
father
for
the
service
of
the
state
in
the
king
utmost
it
is
impossible
said
the
citizen
it
is
absolutely
impossible
if
the
king
could
forget
what
was
due
to
your
father
memory
still
he
would
not
have
wished
would
not
i
may
say
have
dared
to
be
so
flagrantly
unjust
to
the
memory
of
such
a
man
as
your
father
who
dead
in
the
body
will
long
live
in
the
memory
of
the
scottish
i
should
have
been
of
your
opinion
answered
lord
nigel
in
the
same
tone
as
before
but
there
is
no
fighting
with
what
was
the
tenor
of
this
supplication
said
heriot
or
by
whom
was
it
presented
something
strange
there
must
have
been
in
the
contents
or
else
you
may
see
my
original
draught
said
the
young
lord
taking
it
out
of
a
small
travelling
the
technical
part
is
by
my
lawyer
in
scotland
a
skilful
and
sensible
man
the
rest
is
my
own
drawn
i
hope
with
due
deference
and
master
heriot
hastly
cast
his
eye
over
the
draught
nothing
he
said
can
be
more
and
respectful
is
it
possible
the
king
can
have
treated
this
petition
with
contempt
he
threw
it
down
on
the
pavement
said
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
and
sent
me
for
answer
that
proclamation
in
which
he
classes
me
with
the
paupers
and
mendicants
from
scotland
who
disgrace
his
court
in
the
eyes
of
the
proud
english
that
is
all
had
not
my
father
stood
by
him
with
heart
sword
and
fortune
he
might
never
have
seen
the
court
of
england
but
by
whom
was
this
supplication
presented
my
lord
said
heriot
for
the
distaste
taken
at
the
messenger
will
sometimes
extend
itself
to
the
by
my
servant
said
the
lord
nigel
by
the
man
you
saw
and
i
think
were
kind
by
your
servant
my
lord
said
the
citizen
he
seems
a
shrewd
fellow
and
doubtless
a
faithful
but
surely
you
would
say
said
lord
nigel
he
is
no
fit
messenger
to
a
presence
surely
he
is
not
but
what
could
i
do
every
attempt
i
had
made
to
lay
my
case
before
the
king
had
miscarried
and
my
petitions
got
no
farther
than
the
budgets
of
clerks
and
secretaries
this
fellow
pretended
he
had
a
friend
in
the
household
that
would
bring
him
to
the
king
presence
and
so
i
understand
said
heriot
but
my
lord
why
should
you
not
in
right
of
your
rank
and
birth
have
appeared
at
court
and
required
an
audience
which
could
not
have
been
denied
to
you
the
young
lord
blushed
a
little
and
looked
at
his
dress
which
was
very
plain
and
though
in
perfect
good
order
had
the
appearance
of
having
seen
service
i
know
not
why
i
should
be
ashamed
of
speaking
the
truth
he
said
after
a
momentary
hesitation
i
had
no
dress
suitable
for
appearing
at
court
i
am
determined
to
incur
no
expenses
which
i
can
not
discharge
and
i
think
you
sir
would
not
advise
me
to
stand
at
the
in
person
and
deliver
my
petition
along
with
those
who
are
in
very
deed
pleading
their
necessity
and
begging
an
that
had
been
indeed
unseemly
said
the
citizen
but
yet
my
lord
my
mind
runs
strangely
that
there
must
be
some
can
i
speak
with
your
domestic
i
see
little
good
it
can
do
answered
the
young
lord
but
the
interest
you
take
in
my
misfortunes
seems
sincere
and
therefore
he
stamped
on
the
floor
and
in
a
few
seconds
afterwards
moniplies
appeared
wiping
from
his
beard
and
mustaches
the
crumbs
of
bread
and
the
froth
of
the
which
plainly
showed
how
he
had
been
will
your
lordship
grant
permission
said
heriot
that
i
ask
your
groom
a
few
questions
his
lordship
page
master
george
answered
moniplies
with
a
nod
of
acknowledgment
if
you
are
minded
to
speak
according
to
the
hold
your
saucy
tongue
said
his
master
and
reply
distinctly
to
the
questions
you
are
to
be
and
if
it
like
your
pageship
said
the
citizen
for
you
may
remember
i
have
a
gift
to
discover
weel
weel
weel
replied
the
domestic
somewhat
embarrassed
in
spite
of
his
effrontery
though
i
think
that
the
sort
of
truth
that
serves
my
master
may
weel
serve
ony
ane
pages
lie
to
their
masters
by
right
of
custom
said
the
citizen
and
you
write
yourself
in
that
band
though
i
think
you
be
among
the
oldest
of
such
springalds
but
to
me
you
must
speak
truth
if
you
would
not
have
it
end
in
the
and
that
a
bad
said
the
page
so
come
away
with
your
questions
master
well
then
demanded
the
citizen
i
am
given
to
understand
that
you
yesterday
presented
to
his
majesty
hand
a
supplication
or
petition
from
this
honourable
lord
your
troth
there
nae
gainsaying
that
sir
replied
moniplies
there
were
enow
to
see
it
besides
and
you
pretend
that
his
majesty
flung
it
from
him
with
contempt
said
the
citizen
take
heed
for
i
have
means
of
knowing
the
truth
and
you
were
better
up
to
the
neck
in
the
which
you
like
so
well
than
tell
a
leasing
where
his
majesty
name
is
there
is
nae
occasion
for
about
the
matter
answered
moniplies
firmly
his
majesty
flung
it
frae
him
as
if
it
had
dirtied
his
you
hear
sir
said
olifaunt
addressing
heriot
hush
said
the
sagacious
citizen
this
fellow
is
not
ill
named
he
has
more
plies
than
one
in
his
cloak
stay
fellow
for
moniplies
muttering
somewhat
about
finishing
his
breakfast
was
beginning
to
shamble
towards
the
door
answer
me
this
farther
question
when
you
gave
your
master
petition
to
his
majesty
gave
you
nothing
with
it
ou
what
should
i
give
wi
it
ye
ken
master
george
that
is
what
i
desire
and
insist
to
know
replied
his
interrogator
weel
then
i
am
not
free
to
say
that
maybe
i
might
not
just
slip
into
the
king
hand
a
wee
bit
sifflication
of
mine
ain
along
with
my
lord
just
to
save
his
majesty
trouble
and
that
he
might
consider
them
baith
at
a
supplication
of
your
own
you
varlet
said
his
master
ou
dear
ay
my
lord
said
richie
puir
bodies
hae
their
bits
of
sifflications
as
weel
as
their
and
pray
what
might
your
worshipful
petition
import
said
master
nay
for
heaven
sake
my
lord
keep
your
patience
or
we
shall
never
learn
the
truth
of
this
strange
speak
out
sirrah
and
i
will
stand
your
friend
with
my
it
a
lang
story
to
tell
but
the
upshot
is
that
it
a
scrape
of
an
auld
accompt
due
to
my
father
yestate
by
her
majesty
the
king
maist
gracious
mother
when
she
lived
in
the
castle
and
had
sundry
providings
and
furnishings
forth
of
our
booth
whilk
nae
doubt
was
an
honour
to
my
father
to
supply
and
whilk
doubtless
it
will
be
a
credit
to
his
majesty
to
satisfy
as
it
will
be
grit
convenience
to
me
to
receive
the
what
string
of
impertinence
is
this
said
his
master
every
word
as
true
as
john
knox
spoke
said
richie
here
the
bit
double
of
the
master
george
took
a
crumpled
paper
from
the
fellow
hand
and
said
muttering
betwixt
his
teeth
showeth
um
um
his
maist
gracious
mother
um
um
justly
addebted
and
owing
the
sum
of
fifteen
merks
the
compt
whereof
followeth
twelve
nowte
feet
for
jellies
ane
lamb
being
christmas
ane
roasted
capin
in
grease
for
the
privy
chalmer
when
my
lord
of
bothwell
suppit
with
her
grace
i
think
my
lord
you
can
hardly
be
surprised
that
the
king
gave
this
petition
a
brisk
reception
and
i
conclude
master
page
that
you
took
care
to
present
your
own
supplication
before
your
master
troth
did
i
not
answered
moniplies
i
thought
to
have
given
my
lord
first
as
was
reason
gude
and
besides
that
it
wad
have
redd
the
gate
for
my
ain
little
bill
but
what
wi
the
dirdum
an
confusion
the
loupin
here
and
there
of
the
skeigh
brute
of
a
horse
i
believe
i
crammed
them
baith
into
his
hand
and
maybe
my
ain
was
bunemost
and
say
there
was
aught
wrang
i
am
sure
i
had
a
the
fright
and
a
the
risk
and
shall
have
all
the
beating
you
rascal
knave
said
nigel
am
i
to
be
insulted
and
dishonoured
by
your
pragmatical
insolence
in
blending
your
base
concerns
with
mine
nay
nay
nay
my
lord
said
the
citizen
interposing
i
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
the
fellow
blunder
to
light
allow
me
interest
enough
with
your
lordship
to
be
bail
for
his
bones
you
have
cause
to
be
angry
but
still
i
think
the
knave
mistook
more
out
of
conceit
than
of
purpose
and
i
judge
you
will
have
the
better
service
of
him
another
time
if
you
overlook
this
fault
get
you
gone
sirrah
make
your
na
na
said
moniplies
keeping
his
ground
firmly
if
he
likes
to
strike
a
lad
that
has
followed
him
for
pure
love
for
i
think
there
has
been
little
servant
fee
between
us
a
the
way
frae
scotland
just
let
my
lord
be
doing
and
see
the
credit
he
will
get
by
it
and
i
would
rather
mony
thanks
to
you
though
master
george
stand
by
a
lick
of
his
baton
than
it
suld
be
said
a
stranger
came
between
go
then
said
his
master
and
get
out
of
my
aweel
i
wot
that
is
sune
done
said
moniplies
retiring
slowly
i
did
not
come
without
i
had
been
ca
for
and
i
wad
have
been
away
half
an
hour
since
with
my
gude
will
only
maister
george
keepit
me
to
answer
his
interrogation
forsooth
and
that
has
made
a
this
and
so
he
made
his
grumbling
exit
with
the
tone
much
rather
of
one
who
has
sustained
an
injury
than
who
has
done
wrong
there
never
was
a
man
so
plagued
as
i
am
with
a
malapert
knave
the
fellow
is
shrewd
and
i
have
found
him
faithful
i
believe
he
loves
me
too
and
he
has
given
proofs
of
it
but
then
he
is
so
uplifted
in
his
own
conceit
so
and
so
that
he
seems
to
become
the
master
and
i
the
man
and
whatever
blunder
he
commits
he
is
sure
to
make
as
loud
complaints
as
if
the
whole
error
lay
with
me
and
in
no
degree
with
cherish
him
and
maintain
him
nevertheless
said
the
citizen
for
believe
my
grey
hairs
that
affection
and
fidelity
are
now
rarer
qualities
in
a
servitor
than
when
the
world
was
younger
yet
trust
him
my
good
lord
with
no
commission
above
his
birth
or
breeding
for
you
see
yourself
how
it
may
chance
to
it
is
but
too
evident
master
heriot
said
the
young
nobleman
and
i
am
sorry
i
have
done
injustice
to
my
sovereign
and
your
master
but
i
am
like
a
true
scotsman
wise
behind
hand
the
mistake
has
happened
my
supplication
has
been
refused
and
my
only
resource
is
to
employ
the
rest
of
my
means
to
carry
moniplies
and
myself
to
some
and
die
in
the
like
my
it
were
better
to
live
and
serve
your
country
like
your
noble
father
my
lord
replied
master
george
nay
nay
never
look
down
or
shake
your
head
the
king
has
not
refused
your
supplication
for
he
has
not
seen
it
you
ask
but
justice
and
that
his
place
obliges
him
to
give
to
his
subjects
ay
my
lord
and
i
will
say
that
his
natural
temper
doth
in
this
hold
bias
with
his
i
were
well
pleased
to
think
so
and
yet
said
nigel
olifaunt
i
speak
not
of
my
own
wrongs
but
my
country
hath
many
that
are
my
lord
said
master
heriot
i
speak
of
my
royal
master
not
only
with
the
respect
due
from
a
subject
the
gratitude
to
be
paid
by
a
favoured
servant
but
also
with
the
frankness
of
a
free
and
loyal
scotsman
the
king
is
himself
well
disposed
to
hold
the
scales
of
justice
even
but
there
are
those
around
him
who
can
throw
without
detection
their
own
selfish
wishes
and
base
interests
into
the
scale
you
are
already
a
sufferer
by
this
and
without
your
knowing
i
am
surprised
master
heriot
said
the
young
lord
to
hear
you
upon
so
short
an
acquaintance
talk
as
if
you
were
familiarly
acquainted
with
my
my
lord
replied
the
goldsmith
the
nature
of
my
employment
affords
me
direct
access
to
the
interior
of
the
palace
i
am
well
known
to
be
no
meddler
in
intrigues
or
party
affairs
so
that
no
favourite
has
as
yet
endeavoured
to
shut
against
me
the
door
of
the
royal
closet
on
the
contrary
i
have
stood
well
with
each
while
he
was
in
power
and
i
have
not
shared
the
fall
of
any
but
i
can
not
be
thus
connected
with
the
court
without
hearing
even
against
my
will
what
wheels
are
in
motion
and
how
they
are
checked
or
forwarded
of
course
when
i
choose
to
seek
such
intelligence
i
know
the
sources
in
which
it
is
to
be
traced
i
have
told
you
why
i
was
interested
in
your
lordship
fortunes
it
was
last
night
only
that
i
knew
you
were
in
this
city
yet
i
have
been
able
in
coming
hither
this
morning
to
gain
for
you
some
information
respecting
the
impediments
to
your
sir
i
am
obliged
by
your
zeal
however
little
it
may
be
merited
answered
nigel
still
with
some
reserve
yet
i
hardly
know
how
i
have
deserved
this
first
let
me
satisfy
you
that
it
is
real
said
the
citizen
i
blame
you
not
for
being
unwilling
to
credit
the
fair
professions
of
a
stranger
in
my
inferior
class
of
society
when
you
have
met
so
little
friendship
from
relations
and
those
of
your
own
rank
bound
to
have
assisted
you
by
so
many
ties
but
mark
the
cause
there
is
a
mortgage
over
your
father
extensive
estate
to
the
amount
of
merks
due
ostensibly
to
peregrine
peterson
the
conservator
of
scottish
privileges
at
i
know
nothing
of
a
mortgage
said
the
young
lord
but
there
is
a
wadset
for
such
a
sum
which
if
unredeemed
will
occasion
the
forfeiture
of
my
whole
paternal
estate
for
a
sum
not
above
a
fourth
of
its
value
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
i
press
the
government
for
a
settlement
of
the
debts
due
to
my
father
that
i
may
be
able
to
redeem
my
land
from
this
rapacious
a
wadset
in
scotland
said
heriot
is
the
same
with
a
mortgage
on
this
side
of
the
tweed
but
you
are
not
acquainted
with
your
real
creditor
the
conservator
peterson
only
lends
his
name
to
shroud
no
less
a
man
than
the
lord
chancellor
of
scotland
who
hopes
under
cover
of
this
debt
to
gain
possession
of
the
estate
himself
or
perhaps
to
gratify
a
yet
more
powerful
third
party
he
will
probably
suffer
his
creature
peterson
to
take
possession
and
when
the
odium
of
the
transaction
shall
be
forgotten
the
property
and
lordship
of
glenvarloch
will
be
conveyed
to
the
great
man
by
his
obsequious
instrument
under
cover
of
a
sale
or
some
similar
can
this
be
possible
said
lord
nigel
the
chancellor
wept
when
i
took
leave
of
him
called
me
his
cousin
even
his
son
furnished
me
with
letters
and
though
i
asked
him
for
no
pecuniary
assistance
excused
himself
unnecessarily
for
not
pressing
it
on
me
alleging
the
expenses
of
his
rank
and
his
large
family
no
i
can
not
believe
a
nobleman
would
carry
deceit
so
i
am
not
it
is
true
of
noble
blood
said
the
citizen
but
once
more
i
bid
you
look
on
my
grey
hairs
and
think
what
can
be
my
interest
in
dishonouring
them
with
falsehood
in
affairs
in
which
i
have
no
interest
save
as
they
regard
the
son
of
my
benefactor
reflect
also
have
you
had
any
advantage
from
the
lord
chancellor
letters
none
said
nigel
olifaunt
except
cold
deeds
and
fair
words
i
have
thought
for
some
time
their
only
object
was
to
get
rid
of
me
one
yesterday
pressed
money
on
me
when
i
talked
of
going
abroad
in
order
that
i
might
not
want
the
means
of
exiling
right
said
heriot
rather
than
you
fled
not
they
would
themselves
furnish
wings
for
you
to
fly
i
will
to
him
this
instant
said
the
incensed
youth
and
tell
him
my
mind
of
his
under
your
favour
said
heriot
detaining
him
you
shall
not
do
so
by
a
quarrel
you
would
become
the
ruin
of
me
your
informer
and
though
i
would
venture
half
my
shop
to
do
your
lordship
a
service
i
think
you
would
hardly
wish
me
to
come
by
damage
when
it
can
be
of
no
service
to
the
word
sounded
harshly
in
the
ear
of
the
young
nobleman
who
replied
hastily
damage
sir
so
far
am
i
from
wishing
you
to
incur
damage
that
i
would
to
heaven
you
would
cease
your
fruitless
offers
of
serving
one
whom
there
is
no
chance
of
ultimately
assisting
leave
me
alone
for
that
said
the
citizen
you
have
now
erred
as
far
on
the
permit
me
to
take
this
supplication
i
will
have
it
suitably
engrossed
and
take
my
own
time
and
it
shall
be
an
early
one
for
placing
it
with
more
prudence
i
trust
than
that
used
by
your
follower
in
the
king
hand
i
will
almost
answer
for
his
taking
up
the
matter
as
you
would
have
him
but
should
he
fail
to
do
so
even
then
i
will
not
give
up
the
good
sir
said
the
young
nobleman
your
speech
is
so
friendly
and
my
own
state
so
helpless
that
i
know
not
how
to
refuse
your
kind
proffer
even
while
i
blush
to
accept
it
at
the
hands
of
a
we
are
i
trust
no
longer
such
said
the
goldsmith
and
for
my
guerdon
when
my
mediation
proves
successful
and
your
fortunes
are
you
shall
order
your
first
cupboard
of
plate
from
george
you
would
have
a
bad
paymaster
master
heriot
said
lord
nigel
i
do
not
fear
that
replied
the
goldsmith
and
i
am
glad
to
see
you
smile
my
lord
methinks
it
makes
you
look
still
more
like
the
good
old
lord
your
father
and
it
emboldens
me
besides
to
bring
out
a
small
request
that
you
would
take
a
homely
dinner
with
me
i
lodge
hard
by
in
lombard
street
for
the
cheer
my
lord
a
mess
of
white
broth
a
fat
capon
well
larded
a
dish
of
beef
collops
for
auld
scotland
sake
and
it
may
be
a
cup
of
right
old
wine
that
was
barrelled
before
scotland
and
england
were
one
nation
then
for
company
one
or
two
of
our
own
loving
countrymen
and
maybe
my
housewife
may
find
out
a
bonny
scots
lass
or
i
would
accept
your
courtesy
master
heriot
said
nigel
but
i
hear
the
city
ladies
of
london
like
to
see
a
man
gallant
i
would
not
like
to
let
down
a
scottish
nobleman
in
their
ideas
as
doubtless
you
have
said
the
best
of
our
poor
country
and
i
rather
lack
the
means
of
bravery
for
the
my
lord
your
frankness
leads
me
a
step
farther
said
master
george
i
i
owed
your
father
some
monies
and
nay
if
your
lordship
looks
at
me
so
fixedly
i
shall
never
tell
my
story
and
to
speak
plainly
for
i
never
could
carry
a
lie
well
through
in
my
life
it
is
most
fitting
that
to
solicit
this
matter
properly
your
lordship
should
go
to
court
in
a
manner
beseeming
your
quality
i
am
a
goldsmith
and
live
by
lending
money
as
well
as
by
selling
plate
i
am
ambitious
to
put
an
hundred
pounds
to
be
at
interest
in
your
hands
till
your
affairs
are
and
if
they
are
never
favourably
settled
said
nigel
then
my
lord
returned
the
citizen
the
miscarriage
of
such
a
sum
will
be
of
little
consequence
to
me
compared
with
other
subjects
of
master
heriot
said
the
lord
nigel
your
favour
is
generously
offered
and
shall
be
frankly
accepted
i
must
presume
that
you
see
your
way
through
this
business
though
i
hardly
do
for
i
think
you
would
be
grieved
to
add
any
fresh
burden
to
me
by
persuading
me
to
incur
debts
which
i
am
not
likely
to
discharge
i
will
therefore
take
your
money
under
the
hope
and
trust
that
you
will
enable
me
to
repay
you
i
will
convince
you
my
lord
said
the
goldsmith
that
i
mean
to
deal
with
you
as
a
creditor
from
whom
i
expect
payment
and
therefore
you
shall
with
your
own
good
pleasure
sign
an
acknowledgment
for
these
monies
and
an
obligation
to
content
and
repay
he
then
took
from
his
girdle
his
writing
materials
and
writing
a
few
lines
to
the
purport
he
expressed
pulled
out
a
small
bag
of
gold
from
a
under
his
cloak
and
observing
that
it
should
contain
an
hundred
pounds
proceeded
to
tell
out
the
contents
very
methodically
upon
the
table
nigel
olifaunt
could
not
help
intimating
that
this
was
an
unnecessary
ceremonial
and
that
he
would
take
the
bag
of
gold
on
the
word
of
his
obliging
creditor
but
this
was
repugnant
to
the
old
forms
of
transacting
business
bear
with
me
he
said
my
good
lord
we
citizens
are
a
wary
and
thrifty
generation
and
i
should
lose
my
good
name
for
ever
within
the
toll
of
paul
were
i
to
grant
quittance
or
take
acknowledgment
without
bringing
the
money
to
actual
tale
i
think
it
be
right
now
and
body
of
me
he
said
looking
out
at
the
window
yonder
come
my
boys
with
my
mule
for
i
must
westward
hoe
put
your
monies
aside
my
lord
it
is
not
well
to
be
seen
with
such
goldfinches
chirping
about
one
in
the
lodgings
of
london
i
think
the
lock
of
your
casket
be
indifferent
good
if
not
i
can
serve
you
at
an
easy
rate
with
one
that
has
held
thousands
it
was
the
good
old
sir
faithful
frugal
his
spendthrift
son
sold
the
shell
when
he
had
eaten
the
kernel
and
there
is
the
end
of
a
i
hope
yours
will
make
a
better
termination
master
heriot
said
the
lord
nigel
i
hope
it
will
my
lord
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
but
to
use
honest
john
bunyan
phrase
the
water
stood
in
his
eyes
it
has
pleased
god
to
try
me
with
the
loss
of
two
children
and
for
one
adopted
shild
who
ives
ah
woe
is
me
and
but
i
am
patient
and
thankful
and
for
the
wealth
god
has
sent
me
it
shall
not
want
inheritors
while
there
are
orphan
lads
in
auld
i
wish
you
my
one
orphan
has
cause
to
thank
you
already
said
nigel
as
he
attended
him
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
where
resisting
further
escort
the
old
citizen
made
his
escape
as
in
going
downstairs
he
passed
the
shop
where
dame
christie
stood
becking
he
made
civil
inquiries
after
her
husband
the
dame
of
course
regretted
his
absence
but
he
was
down
she
said
at
deptford
to
settle
with
a
dutch
our
way
of
business
sir
she
said
takes
him
much
from
home
and
my
husband
must
be
the
slave
of
every
tarry
jacket
that
wants
but
a
pound
of
all
business
must
be
minded
dame
said
the
goldsmith
make
my
remembrances
george
heriot
of
lombard
street
remembrances
to
your
goodman
i
have
dealt
with
him
he
is
just
and
punctual
true
to
time
and
engagements
be
kind
to
your
noble
guest
and
see
he
wants
nothing
though
it
be
his
pleasure
at
present
to
lie
private
and
retired
there
be
those
that
care
for
him
and
i
have
a
charge
to
see
him
supplied
so
that
you
may
let
me
know
by
your
husband
my
good
dame
how
my
lord
is
and
whether
he
wants
and
so
he
a
real
lord
after
all
said
the
good
dame
i
am
sure
i
always
thought
he
looked
like
one
but
why
does
he
not
go
to
parliament
then
he
will
dame
answered
heriot
to
the
parliament
of
scotland
which
is
his
own
oh
he
is
but
a
scots
lord
then
said
the
good
dame
and
that
the
thing
makes
him
ashamed
to
take
the
title
as
they
let
him
not
hear
say
so
dame
replied
the
citizen
who
i
sir
answered
she
no
such
matter
in
my
thought
sir
scot
or
english
he
is
at
any
rate
a
likely
man
and
a
civil
man
and
rather
than
he
should
want
any
thing
i
would
wait
upon
him
myself
and
come
as
far
as
lombard
street
to
wait
upon
your
worship
let
your
husband
come
to
me
good
dame
said
the
goldsmith
who
with
all
his
experience
and
worth
was
somewhat
of
a
formalist
and
disciplinarian
the
proverb
says
goes
mad
when
women
gad
and
let
his
lordship
own
man
wait
upon
his
master
in
his
chamber
it
is
more
seemly
god
give
ye
to
your
worship
said
the
dame
somewhat
coldly
and
so
soon
as
the
adviser
was
out
of
hearing
was
ungracious
enough
to
mutter
in
contempt
of
his
council
marry
quep
of
your
advice
for
an
old
scotch
tinsmith
as
you
are
my
husband
is
as
wise
and
very
near
as
old
as
yourself
and
if
i
please
him
it
is
well
enough
and
though
he
is
not
just
so
rich
just
now
as
some
folks
yet
i
hope
to
see
him
ride
upon
his
moyle
with
a
and
have
his
two
after
him
as
well
as
they
chapter
v
wherefore
come
ye
not
to
court
certain
is
the
rarest
sport
there
are
silks
and
jewels
glistening
prattling
fools
and
wise
men
listening
bullies
among
brave
men
justling
beggars
amongst
nobles
bustling
talkers
minion
lispers
cutting
honest
throats
by
whispers
wherefore
come
ye
not
to
court
skelton
swears
is
glorious
sport
it
was
not
entirely
out
of
parade
that
the
benevolent
citizen
was
mounted
and
attended
in
that
manner
which
as
the
reader
has
been
informed
excited
a
gentle
degree
of
spleen
on
the
part
of
dame
christie
which
to
do
her
justice
vanished
in
the
little
soliloquy
which
we
have
recorded
the
good
man
besides
the
natural
desire
to
maintain
the
exterior
of
a
man
of
worship
was
at
present
bound
to
whitehall
in
order
to
exhibit
a
piece
of
valuable
workmanship
to
king
james
which
he
deemed
his
majesty
might
be
pleased
to
view
or
even
to
purchase
he
himself
was
therefore
mounted
upon
his
caparisoned
mule
that
he
might
the
better
make
his
way
through
the
narrow
dirty
and
crowded
streets
and
while
one
of
his
attendants
carried
under
his
arm
the
piece
of
plate
wrapped
up
in
red
baize
the
other
two
gave
an
eye
to
its
safety
for
such
was
then
the
state
of
the
police
of
the
metropolis
that
men
were
often
assaulted
in
the
public
street
for
the
sake
of
revenge
or
of
plunder
and
those
who
apprehended
being
beset
usually
endeavoured
if
their
estate
admitted
such
expense
to
secure
themselves
by
the
attendance
of
armed
followers
and
this
custom
which
was
at
first
limited
to
the
nobility
and
gentry
extended
by
degrees
to
those
citizens
of
consideration
who
being
understood
to
travel
with
a
charge
as
it
was
called
might
otherwise
have
been
selected
as
safe
subjects
of
plunder
by
the
as
master
george
heriot
paced
forth
westward
with
this
gallant
attendance
he
paused
at
the
shop
door
of
his
countryman
and
friend
the
ancient
horologer
and
having
caused
tunstall
who
was
in
attendance
to
adjust
his
watch
by
the
real
time
he
desired
to
speak
with
his
master
in
consequence
of
which
summons
the
old
came
forth
from
his
den
his
face
like
a
bronze
bust
darkened
with
dust
and
glistening
here
and
there
with
copper
filings
and
his
senses
so
bemused
in
the
intensity
of
calculation
that
he
gazed
on
his
friend
the
goldsmith
for
a
minute
before
he
seemed
perfectly
to
comprehend
who
he
was
and
heard
him
express
his
invitation
to
david
ramsay
and
pretty
mistress
margaret
his
daughter
to
dine
with
him
next
day
at
noon
to
meet
with
a
noble
young
countrymen
without
returning
any
answer
i
make
thee
speak
with
a
murrain
to
thee
muttered
heriot
to
himself
and
suddenly
changing
his
tone
he
said
aloud
i
pray
you
neighbour
david
when
are
you
and
i
to
have
a
settlement
for
the
bullion
wherewith
i
supplied
you
to
mount
yonder
at
theobald
and
that
other
whirligig
that
you
made
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
i
have
had
the
spanish
house
to
satisfy
for
the
ingots
and
i
must
needs
put
you
in
mind
that
you
have
been
eight
months
there
is
something
so
sharp
and
in
the
demand
of
a
peremptory
dun
that
no
human
tympanum
however
inaccessible
to
other
tones
can
resist
the
application
david
ramsay
started
at
once
from
his
reverie
and
answered
in
a
pettish
tone
wow
george
man
what
needs
aw
this
din
about
sax
score
o
pounds
aw
the
world
kens
i
can

proffered
yourself
fair
time
till
his
maist
gracious
majesty
and
the
noble
duke
suld
make
settled
accompts
wi
me
and
ye
may

by
your
ain
experience
that
i
canna
gang
rowting
like
an
unmannered
highland
stot
to
their
doors
as
ye
come
to
heriot
laughed
and
replied
well
david
i
see
a
demand
of
money
is
like
a
bucket
of
water
about
your
ears
and
makes
you
a
man
of
the
world
at
once
and
now
friend
will
you
tell
me
like
a
christian
man
if
you
will
dine
with
me
at
noon
and
bring
pretty
mistress
margaret
my
with
you
to
meet
with
our
noble
young
countryman
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
said
the
old
mechanist
wi
aw
my
heart
and
blithe
i
will
be
to
see
him
again
we
have
not
met
these
forty
years
he
was
twa
years
before
me
at
the
humanity
classes
he
is
a
sweet
that
was
his
father
his
father
his
father
you
old
dotard
that

the
goldsmith
a
sweet
youth

would
have
been
by
this
time
had
he
lived
worthy
nobleman
this
is
his
son
the
lord
his
son
said
ramsay
maybe
he
will
want
something
of
a
chronometer
or
watch
few
gallants
care
to
be
without
them
he
may
buy
half
your
if
ever
he
comes
to
his
own
for
what
i
know
said
his
friend
but
david
remember
your
bond
and
use
me
not
as
you
did
when
my
housewife
had
the
and
the
boiling
for
you
as
late
as
two
of
the
clock
she
had
the
more
credit
by
her
cookery
answered
david
now
fully
awake
a
were
poison
according
to
our
well
answered
master
george
but
as
there
will
be
no
it
may
chance
you
to
spoil
a
dinner
which
a
proverb
can
not
mend
it
may
be
you
may
forgather
with
your
friend
sir
mungo
malagrowther
for
i
purpose
to
ask
his
worship
so
be
sure
and
bide
tryste
that
will
i
i
will
be
true
as
a
chronometer
said
ramsay
i
will
not
trust
you
though
replied
hear
you
jenkin
boy
tell
scots
janet
to
tell
pretty
mistress
margaret
my
she
must
put
her
father
in
remembrance
to
put
on
his
best
doublet
and
to
bring
him
to
lombard
street
at
noon
tell
her
they
are
to
meet
a
brave
young
scots
jenkin
coughed
that
sort
of
dry
short
cough
uttered
by
those
who
are
either
charged
with
errands
which
they
do
not
like
or
hear
opinions
to
which
they
must
not
enter
a
dissent
umph
repeated
master
george
who
as
we
have
already
noticed
was
something
of
a
martinet
in
domestic
discipline
what
does
mean
will
you
do
mine
errand
or
not
sirrah
sure
master
george
heriot
said
the
apprentice
touching
his
cap
i
only
meant
that
mistress
margaret
was
not
likely
to
forget
such
an
why
no
said
master
george
she
is
a
dutiful
girl
to
her
though
i
sometimes
call
her
a
and
hark
ye
jenkin
you
and
your
comrade
had
best
come
with
your
clubs
to
see
your
master
and
her
safely
home
but
first
shut
shop
and
loose
the
and
let
the
porter
stay
in
the
till
your
return
i
will
send
two
of
my
knaves
with
you
for
i
hear
these
wild
youngsters
of
the
temple
are
broken
out
worse
and
lighter
than
we
can
keep
their
steel
in
order
with
good
handbats
said
jenkin
and
never
trouble
your
servants
for
the
or
if
need
be
said
tunstall
we
have
swords
as
well
as
the
fie
upon
it
fie
upon
it
young
man
said
the
citizen
an
apprentice
with
a
sword
marry
heaven
forefend
i
would
as
soon
see
him
in
a
hat
and
well
sir
said
jenkin
we
will
find
arms
fitting
to
our
station
and
will
defend
our
master
and
his
daughter
if
we
should
tear
up
the
very
stones
of
the
there
spoke
a
london
bold
said
the
citizen
and
for
your
comfort
my
lads
you
shall
crush
a
cup
of
wine
to
the
health
of
the
fathers
of
the
city
i
have
my
eye
on
both
of
you
you
are
thriving
lads
each
in
his
own
god
be
wi
you
davie
forget
not
at
and
so
saying
he
again
turned
his
mule
head
westward
and
crossed
temple
bar
at
that
slow
and
decent
amble
which
at
once
became
his
rank
and
civic
importance
and
put
his
pedestrian
followers
to
no
inconvenience
to
keep
up
with
him
at
the
temple
gate
he
again
paused
dismounted
and
sought
his
way
into
one
of
the
small
booths
occupied
by
scriveners
in
the
neighbourhood
a
young
man
with
lank
smooth
hair
combed
straight
to
his
ears
and
then
cropped
short
rose
with
a
cringing
reverence
pulled
off
a
slouched
hat
which
he
would
upon
no
signal
replace
on
his
head
and
answered
with
much
demonstration
of
reverence
to
the
goldsmith
question
of
how
goes
business
andrew
aw
the
better
for
your
worship
kind
countenance
and
get
a
large
sheet
of
paper
man
and
make
a
new
pen
with
a
sharp
neb
and
fine
do
not
slit
the
quill
up
too
high
it
a
wastrife
course
in
your
trade
andrew
they
that
do
not
mind
never
come
to
forpits
i
have
known
a
learned
man
write
a
thousand
pages
with
one
footnote
a
biblical
commentary
by
gill
which
if
the
author
memory
serves
him
occupies
between
five
and
six
hundred
printed
quarto
pages
and
must
therefore
have
filled
more
pages
of
manuscript
than
the
number
mentioned
in
the
text
has
this
quatrain
at
the
end
of
the
volume
with
one
good
pen
i
wrote
this
book
made
of
a
grey
goose
quill
a
pen
it
was
when
it
i
took
and
a
pen
i
leave
it
ah
sir
said
the
lad
who
listened
to
the
goldsmith
though
instructing
him
in
his
own
trade
with
an
air
of
veneration
and
acquiescence
how
sune
ony
puir
creature
like
mysell
may
rise
in
the
world
wi
the
instruction
of
such
a
man
as
your
worship
my
instructions
are
few
andrew
soon
told
and
not
hard
to
practise
be
honest
be
industrious
be
frugal
and
you
will
soon
win
wealth
and
here
copy
me
this
supplication
in
your
best
and
most
formal
hand
i
will
wait
by
you
till
it
is
the
youth
lifted
not
his
eye
from
the
paper
and
laid
not
the
pen
from
his
hand
until
the
task
was
finished
to
his
employer
satisfaction
the
citizen
then
gave
the
young
scrivener
an
angel
and
bidding
him
on
his
life
be
secret
in
all
business
intrusted
to
him
again
mounted
his
mule
and
rode
on
westward
along
the
strand
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remind
our
readers
that
the
temple
bar
which
heriot
passed
was
not
the
arched
screen
or
gateway
of
the
present
day
but
an
open
railing
or
palisade
which
at
night
and
in
times
of
alarm
was
closed
with
a
barricade
of
posts
and
chains
the
strand
also
along
which
he
rode
was
not
as
now
a
continued
street
although
it
was
beginning
already
to
assume
that
character
it
still
might
be
considered
as
an
open
road
along
the
south
side
of
which
stood
various
houses
and
hotels
belonging
to
the
nobility
having
gardens
behind
them
down
to
the
with
stairs
to
the
river
for
the
convenience
of
taking
boat
which
mansions
have
bequeathed
the
names
of
their
lordly
owners
to
many
of
the
streets
leading
from
the
strand
to
the
thames
the
north
side
of
the
strand
was
also
a
long
line
of
houses
behind
which
as
in
saint
martin
lane
and
other
points
buildings
were
rapidly
arising
but
covent
garden
was
still
a
garden
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
or
at
least
but
beginning
to
be
studded
with
irregular
buildings
all
that
was
passing
around
however
marked
the
rapid
increase
of
a
capital
which
had
long
enjoyed
peace
wealth
and
a
regular
government
houses
were
rising
in
every
direction
and
the
shrewd
eye
of
our
citizen
already
saw
the
period
not
distant
which
should
convert
the
nearly
open
highway
on
which
he
travelled
into
a
connected
and
regular
street
uniting
the
court
and
the
town
with
the
city
of
london
he
next
passed
charing
cross
which
was
no
longer
the
pleasant
solitary
village
at
which
the
judges
were
wont
to
breakfast
on
their
way
to
westminster
hall
but
began
to
resemble
the
artery
through
which
to
use
johnson
expression
pours
the
full
tide
of
london
the
buildings
were
rapidly
increasing
yet
certainly
gave
not
even
a
faint
idea
of
its
present
appearance
at
last
whitehall
received
our
traveller
who
passed
under
one
of
the
beautiful
gates
designed
by
holbein
and
composed
of
tesselated
being
the
same
to
which
moniplies
had
profanely
likened
the
of
edinburgh
and
entered
the
ample
precincts
of
the
palace
of
whitehall
now
full
of
all
the
confusion
attending
improvement
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
james
little
suspecting
that
he
was
employed
in
constructing
a
palace
from
the
window
of
which
his
only
son
was
to
pass
in
order
that
he
might
die
upon
a
scaffold
before
it
was
busied
in
removing
the
ancient
and
ruinous
buildings
of
de
burgh
henry
and
queen
elizabeth
to
make
way
for
the
superb
architecture
on
which
inigo
jones
exerted
all
his
genius
the
king
ignorant
of
futurity
was
now
engaged
in
pressing
on
his
work
and
for
that
purpose
still
maintained
his
royal
apartments
at
whitehall
amidst
the
rubbish
of
old
buildings
and
the
various
confusion
attending
the
erection
of
the
new
pile
which
formed
at
present
a
labyrinth
not
easily
traversed
the
goldsmith
to
the
royal
household
and
who
if
fame
spoke
true
oftentimes
acted
as
their
banker
for
these
professions
were
not
as
yet
separated
from
each
other
was
a
person
of
too
much
importance
to
receive
the
slightest
interruption
from
sentinel
or
porter
and
leaving
his
mule
and
two
of
his
followers
in
the
he
gently
knocked
at
a
of
the
building
and
was
presently
admitted
while
the
most
trusty
of
his
attendants
followed
him
closely
with
the
piece
of
plate
under
his
arm
this
man
also
he
left
behind
him
in
an
where
three
or
four
pages
in
the
royal
livery
but
untrussed
unbuttoned
and
dressed
more
carelessly
than
the
place
and
nearness
to
a
king
person
seemed
to
admit
were
playing
at
dice
and
draughts
or
stretched
upon
benches
and
slumbering
with
eyes
a
corresponding
gallery
which
opened
from
the
was
occupied
by
two
of
the
chamber
who
gave
each
a
smile
of
recognition
as
the
wealthy
goldsmith
entered
no
word
was
spoken
on
either
side
but
one
of
the
ushers
looked
first
to
heriot
and
then
to
a
little
door
by
the
tapestry
which
seemed
to
say
as
plain
as
a
look
could
lies
your
business
that
way
the
citizen
nodded
and
the
moving
on
tiptoe
and
with
as
much
caution
as
if
the
floor
had
been
paved
with
eggs
advanced
to
the
door
opened
it
gently
and
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
the
broad
scottish
accent
of
king
james
was
heard
in
reply
admit
him
instanter
maxwell
have
you
hairboured
sae
lang
at
the
court
and
not
learned
that
gold
and
silver
are
ever
welcome
the
usher
signed
to
heriot
to
advance
and
the
honest
citizen
was
presently
introduced
into
the
cabinet
of
the
sovereign
the
scene
of
confusion
amid
which
he
found
the
king
seated
was
no
bad
picture
of
the
state
and
quality
of
james
own
mind
there
was
much
that
was
rich
and
costly
in
cabinet
pictures
and
valuable
ornaments
but
they
were
arranged
in
a
slovenly
manner
covered
with
dust
and
lost
half
their
value
or
at
least
their
effect
from
the
manner
in
which
they
were
presented
to
the
eye
the
table
was
loaded
with
huge
folios
amongst
which
lay
light
books
of
jest
and
ribaldry
and
amongst
notes
of
unmercifully
long
orations
and
essays
on
were
mingled
miserable
roundels
and
ballads
by
the
royal
as
he
styled
himself
in
the
art
of
poetry
and
schemes
for
the
general
pacification
of
europe
with
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
king
hounds
and
remedies
against
canine
madness
the
king
dress
was
of
green
velvet
quilted
so
full
as
to
be
which
gave
him
the
appearance
of
clumsy
and
ungainly
protuberance
while
its
being
buttoned
awry
communicated
to
his
figure
an
air
of
distortion
over
his
green
doublet
he
wore
a
nightgown
out
of
the
pocket
of
which
peeped
his
his
grey
hat
lay
on
the
floor
covered
with
dust
but
encircled
by
a
carcanet
of
large
balas
rubies
and
he
wore
a
blue
velvet
nightcap
in
the
front
of
which
was
placed
the
plume
of
a
heron
which
had
been
struck
down
by
a
favourite
hawk
in
some
critical
moment
of
the
flight
in
remembrance
of
which
the
king
wore
this
highly
honoured
feather
but
such
inconsistencies
in
dress
and
appointments
were
mere
outward
types
of
those
which
existed
in
the
royal
character
rendering
it
a
subject
of
doubt
amongst
his
contemporaries
and
bequeathing
it
as
a
problem
to
future
historians
he
was
deeply
learned
without
possessing
useful
knowledge
sagacious
in
many
individual
cases
without
having
real
wisdom
fond
of
his
power
and
desirous
to
maintain
and
augment
it
yet
willing
to
resign
the
direction
of
that
and
of
himself
to
the
most
unworthy
favourites
a
big
and
bold
asserter
of
his
rights
in
words
yet
one
who
tamely
saw
them
trampled
on
in
deeds
a
lover
of
negotiations
in
which
he
was
always
outwitted
and
one
who
feared
war
where
conquest
might
have
been
easy
he
was
fond
of
his
dignity
while
he
was
perpetually
degrading
it
by
undue
familiarity
capable
of
much
public
labour
yet
often
neglecting
it
for
the
meanest
amusement
a
wit
though
a
pedant
and
a
scholar
though
fond
of
the
conversation
of
the
ignorant
and
uneducated
even
his
timidity
of
temper
was
not
uniform
and
there
were
moments
of
his
life
and
those
critical
in
which
he
showed
the
spirit
of
his
ancestors
he
was
laborious
in
trifles
and
a
trifler
where
serious
labour
was
required
devout
in
his
sentiments
and
yet
too
often
profane
in
his
language
just
and
beneficent
by
nature
he
yet
gave
way
to
the
iniquities
and
oppression
of
others
he
was
penurious
respecting
money
which
he
had
to
give
from
his
own
hand
yet
inconsiderately
and
unboundedly
profuse
of
that
which
he
did
not
see
in
a
word
those
good
qualities
which
displayed
themselves
in
particular
cases
and
occasions
were
not
of
a
nature
sufficiently
firm
and
comprehensive
to
regulate
his
general
conduct
and
showing
themselves
as
they
occasionally
did
only
entitled
james
to
the
character
bestowed
on
him
by
sully
that
he
was
the
wisest
fool
in
christendom
that
the
fortunes
of
this
monarch
might
be
as
little
of
apiece
as
his
character
he
certainly
the
least
able
of
the
stewarts
succeeded
peaceably
to
that
kingdom
against
the
power
of
which
his
predecessors
had
with
so
much
difficulty
defended
his
native
throne
and
lastly
although
his
reign
appeared
calculated
to
ensure
to
great
britain
that
lasting
tranquillity
and
internal
peace
which
so
much
suited
the
disposition
yet
during
that
very
reign
were
sown
those
seeds
of
dissension
which
like
the
teeth
of
the
fabulous
dragon
had
their
harvest
in
a
bloody
and
universal
civil
war
such
was
the
monarch
who
saluting
heriot
by
the
name
of
jingling
geordie
for
it
was
his
custom
to
give
nicknames
to
all
those
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
familiarity
inquired
what
new
he
had
brought
with
him
to
cheat
his
lawful
and
native
prince
out
of
his
siller
god
forbid
my
liege
said
the
citizen
that
i
should
have
any
such
disloyal
purpose
i
did
but
bring
a
piece
of
plate
to
show
to
your
most
gracious
majesty
which
both
for
the
subject
and
for
the
workmanship
i
were
loath
to
put
into
the
hands
of
any
subject
until
i
knew
your
majesty
pleasure
anent
body
o
me
man
let
see
it
heriot
though
by
my
saul
service
o
plate
was
sae
dear
a
bargain
i
had
pawned
my
word
as
a
royal
king
to
keep
my
ain
gold
and
silver
in
future
and
let
you
geordie
keep
respecting
the
duke
of
buckingham
plate
said
the
goldsmith
your
majesty
was
pleased
to
direct
that
no
expense
should
be
spared
and
what
signifies
what
i
desired
man
when
a
wise
man
is
with
fules
and
bairns
he
maun
play
at
the
chucks
but
you
should
have
had
mair
sense
and
consideration
than
to
gie
babie
charles
and
steenie
their
ain
gate
they
wad
hae
floored
the
very
rooms
wi
silver
and
i
wonder
they
george
heriot
bowed
and
said
no
more
he
knew
his
master
too
well
to
vindicate
himself
otherwise
than
by
a
distant
allusion
to
his
order
and
james
with
whom
economy
was
only
a
transient
and
momentary
twinge
of
conscience
became
immediately
afterwards
desirous
to
see
the
piece
of
plate
which
the
goldsmith
proposed
to
exhibit
and
dispatched
maxwell
to
bring
it
to
his
presence
in
the
meantime
he
demanded
of
the
citizen
whence
he
had
procured
it
from
italy
may
it
please
your
majesty
replied
heriot
it
has
naething
in
it
tending
to
papistrie
said
the
king
looking
graver
than
his
wont
surely
not
please
your
majesty
said
heriot
i
were
not
wise
to
bring
any
thing
to
your
presence
that
had
the
mark
of
the
you
would
be
the
mair
beast
yourself
to
do
so
said
the
king
it
is
weel
kend
that
i
wrestled
wi
dagon
in
my
youth
and
smote
him
on
the
groundsill
of
his
own
temple
a
gude
evidence
that
i
should
be
in
time
called
however
unworthy
the
defender
of
the
but
here
comes
maxwell
bending
under
his
burden
like
the
golden
ass
of
heriot
hastened
to
relieve
the
usher
and
to
place
the
embossed
salver
for
such
it
was
and
of
extraordinary
dimensions
in
a
light
favourable
for
his
majesty
viewing
the
sculpture
saul
of
my
body
man
said
the
king
it
is
a
curious
piece
and
as
i
think
fit
for
a
king
chalmer
and
the
subject
as
you
say
master
george
vera
adequate
and
beseeming
being
as
i
see
the
judgment
of
solomon
a
prince
in
whose
paths
it
weel
becomes
a
leeving
monarchs
to
walk
with
but
whose
footsteps
said
maxwell
only
one
of
them
if
a
subject
may
say
so
much
hath
ever
haud
your
tongue
for
a
fause
fleeching
loon
said
the
king
but
with
a
smile
on
his
face
that
showed
the
flattery
had
done
its
part
look
at
the
bonny
piece
of
workmanship
and
haud
your
clavering
and
whase
handiwork
may
it
be
geordie
it
was
wrought
sir
replied
the
goldsmith
by
the
famous
florentine
benvenuto
cellini
and
designed
for
francis
the
first
of
france
but
i
hope
it
will
find
a
fitter
francis
of
france
said
the
king
send
solomon
king
of
the
jews
to
francis
of
france
body
of
me
man
it
would
have
kythed
cellini
mad
had
he
never
done
ony
thing
else
out
of
the
gate
francis
why
he
was
a
fighting
fule
man
a
mere
fighting
fule
got
himsell
at
pavia
like
our
ain
david
at
durham
lang
syne
if
they
could
hae
sent
him
solomon
wit
and
love
of
peace
and
godliness
they
wad
hae
dune
him
a
better
turn
but
solomon
should
sit
in
other
gate
company
than
francis
of
i
trust
that
such
will
be
his
good
fortune
said
heriot
it
is
a
curious
and
very
artificial
sculpture
said
the
king
in
continuation
but
yet
methinks
the
carnifex
or
executioner
there
is
brandishing
his
gully
ower
near
the
king
face
seeing
he
is
within
reach
of
his
weapon
i
think
less
wisdom
than
solomon
wad
have
taught
him
that
there
was
danger
in
and
that
he
wad
have
bidden
the
smaik
either
sheath
his
shabble
or
stand
farther
george
heriot
endeavoured
to
alleviate
this
objection
by
assuring
the
king
that
the
vicinity
betwixt
solomon
and
the
executioner
was
nearer
in
appearance
than
in
reality
and
that
the
perspective
should
be
allowed
for
gang
to
the
deil
wi
your
prospective
man
said
the
king
there
canna
be
a
waur
prospective
for
a
lawful
king
wha
wishes
to
reign
in
luve
and
die
in
peace
and
honour
than
to
have
naked
swords
flashing
in
his
een
i
am
accounted
as
brave
as
maist
folks
and
yet
i
profess
to
ye
i
could
never
look
on
a
bare
blade
without
blinking
and
winking
but
it
is
a
brave
piece
and
what
is
the
price
of
it
man
the
goldsmith
replied
by
observing
that
it
was
not
his
own
property
but
that
of
a
distressed
countryman
whilk
you
mean
to
mak
your
excuse
for
asking
the
double
of
its
worth
i
warrant
answered
the
king
i
ken
the
tricks
of
you
merchants
i
have
no
hopes
of
baffling
your
majesty
sagacity
said
heriot
the
piece
is
really
what
i
say
and
the
price
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
sterling
if
it
pleases
your
majesty
to
make
present
a
hundred
and
fifty
punds
man
and
as
mony
witches
and
warlocks
to
raise
them
said
the
irritated
monarch
my
saul
jingling
geordie
ye
are
minded
that
your
purse
shall
jingle
to
a
bonny
tune
how
am
i
to
tell
you
down
a
hundred
and
fifty
punds
for
what
will
not
weigh
as
many
merks
and
ye
ken
that
my
very
household
servitors
and
the
officers
of
my
mouth
are
sax
months
in
arrear
the
goldsmith
stood
his
ground
against
all
this
objurgation
being
what
he
was
well
accustomed
to
and
only
answered
that
if
his
majesty
liked
the
piece
and
desired
to
possess
it
the
price
could
be
easily
settled
it
was
true
that
the
party
required
the
money
but
he
george
heriot
would
advance
it
on
his
majesty
account
if
such
were
his
pleasure
and
wait
his
royal
conveniency
for
payment
for
that
and
other
matters
the
money
meanwhile
lying
at
the
ordinary
usage
by
my
honour
said
james
and
that
is
speaking
like
an
honest
and
reasonable
tradesman
we
maun
get
another
subsidy
frae
the
commons
and
that
will
make
ae
compting
of
it
awa
wi
it
maxwell
awa
wi
it
and
let
it
be
set
where
steenie
and
babie
charles
shall
see
it
as
they
return
from
and
now
that
we
are
secret
my
good
auld
friend
geordie
i
do
truly
opine
that
speaking
of
solomon
and
ourselves
the
haill
wisdom
in
the
country
left
scotland
when
we
took
our
travels
to
the
southland
george
heriot
was
courtier
enough
to
say
that
the
wise
naturally
follow
the
wisest
as
stags
follow
their
troth
i
think
there
is
something
in
what
thou
sayest
said
james
for
we
ourselves
and
those
of
our
court
and
household
as
thou
thyself
for
example
are
allowed
by
the
english
for
as
as
they
are
to
pass
for
reasonable
good
wits
but
the
brains
of
those
we
have
left
behind
are
all
astir
and
run
clean
like
sae
mony
warlocks
and
witches
on
the
devil
sabbath
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
my
liege
said
heriot
may
it
please
your
grace
to
say
what
our
countrymen
have
done
to
deserve
such
a
character
they
are
become
frantic
man
clean
answered
the
king
i
can
not
keep
them
out
of
the
court
by
all
the
proclamations
that
the
heralds
roar
themselves
hoarse
with
yesterday
nae
farther
gane
just
as
we
were
mounted
and
about
to
ride
forth
in
rushed
a
thorough
edinburgh
gutterblood
a
ragged
rascal
every
dud
upon
whose
back
was
bidding
to
the
other
with
a
coat
and
hat
that
would
have
served
a
and
without
havings
or
reverence
thrusts
into
our
hands
like
a
sturdy
beggar
some
supplication
about
debts
owing
by
our
gracious
mother
and
siclike
trash
whereat
the
horse
spangs
on
end
and
but
for
our
admirable
sitting
wherein
we
have
been
thought
to
excel
maist
sovereign
princes
as
well
as
subjects
in
europe
i
promise
you
we
would
have
been
laid
endlang
on
the
your
majesty
said
heriot
is
their
common
father
and
therefore
they
are
the
bolder
to
press
into
your
gracious
i
ken
i
am
well
enough
said
james
but
one
would
think
they
had
a
mind
to
squeeze
my
puddings
out
that
they
may
divide
the
inheritance
ud
death
geordie
there
is
not
a
loon
among
them
can
deliver
a
supplication
as
it
suld
be
done
in
the
face
of
i
would
i
knew
the
most
fitting
and
beseeming
mode
to
do
so
said
heriot
were
it
but
to
instruct
our
poor
countrymen
in
better
by
my
halidome
said
the
king
ye
are
a
ceevileezed
fellow
geordie
and
i
carena
if
i
fling
awa
as
much
time
as
may
teach
ye
and
first
see
you
sir
ye
shall
approach
the
presence
of
majesty
thus
shadowing
your
eyes
with
your
hand
to
testify
that
you
are
in
the
presence
of
the
of
vera
weel
george
that
is
done
in
a
comely
then
sir
ye
sail
kneel
and
make
as
if
ye
would
kiss
the
hem
of
our
garment
the
latch
of
our
shoe
or
such
very
weel
enacted
whilk
we
as
being
willing
to
be
debonair
and
pleasing
towards
our
lieges
prevent
thus
and
motion
to
you
to
rise
whilk
having
a
boon
to
ask
as
yet
you
obey
not
but
gliding
your
hand
into
your
pouch
bring
forth
your
supplication
and
place
it
reverentially
in
our
open
the
goldsmith
who
had
complied
with
great
accuracy
with
all
the
prescribed
points
of
the
ceremonial
here
completed
it
to
no
small
astonishment
by
placing
in
his
hand
the
petition
of
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
what
means
this
ye
fause
loon
said
he
reddening
and
sputtering
hae
i
been
teaching
you
the
manual
exercise
that
ye
suld
present
your
piece
at
our
ain
royal
body
now
by
this
light
i
had
as
lief
that
ye
had
bended
a
real
pistolet
against
me
and
yet
this
hae
ye
done
in
my
very
cabinet
where
nought
suld
enter
but
at
my
ain
i
trust
your
majesty
said
heriot
as
he
continued
to
kneel
will
forgive
my
exercising
the
lesson
you
condescended
to
give
me
in
the
behalf
of
a
friend
of
a
friend
said
the
king
so
much
the
waur
so
much
the
waur
i
tell
you
if
it
had
been
something
to
do
good
there
would
have
been
some
sense
in
it
and
some
chance
that
you
wad
not
have
come
back
on
me
in
a
hurry
but
a
man
may
have
a
hundred
friends
and
petitions
for
every
ane
of
them
ilk
ane
after
your
majesty
i
trust
said
heriot
will
judge
me
by
former
experience
and
will
not
suspect
me
of
such
i
kenna
said
the
placable
monarch
the
world
goes
daft
i
think
semel
insanivimus
thou
art
my
old
and
faithful
servant
that
is
the
truth
and
any
thing
for
thy
own
behoof
man
thou
shouldst
not
ask
twice
but
troth
steenie
loves
me
so
dearly
that
he
cares
not
that
any
one
should
ask
favours
of
me
but
maxwell
for
the
usher
had
after
having
carried
off
the
plate
get
into
the
wi
your
lang
in
conscience
geordie
i
think
as
that
thou
hast
been
mine
ain
auld
fiduciary
and
wert
my
goldsmith
when
i
might
say
with
the
ethnic
poet
mea
renidet
in
domo
for
faith
they
had
pillaged
my
mither
auld
house
sae
that
beechen
bickers
and
treen
trenchers
and
latten
platters
were
whiles
the
best
at
our
board
and
glad
we
were
of
something
to
put
on
them
without
quarrelling
with
the
metal
of
the
dishes
d
mind
for
thou
wert
in
maist
of
our
complots
how
we
were
fain
to
send
sax
of
the
to
harry
the
lady
of
dowcot
and
and
what
an
awfu
plaint
the
poor
dame
made
against
jock
of
milch
and
the
thieves
of
annandale
wha
were
as
sackless
of
the
deed
as
i
am
of
the
sin
of
murder
it
was
the
better
for
jock
said
heriot
for
if
i
remember
weel
it
saved
him
from
a
strapping
up
at
dumfries
which
he
had
weel
deserved
for
other
ay
man
mind
ye
that
said
the
king
but
he
had
other
virtues
for
he
was
a
tight
huntsman
moreover
that
jock
of
milch
and
could
hollow
to
a
hound
till
all
the
woods
rang
again
but
he
came
to
an
annandale
end
at
the
last
for
lord
torthorwald
run
his
lance
out
through
cocksnails
man
when
i
think
of
those
wild
passages
in
my
conscience
i
am
not
sure
but
we
lived
merrier
in
auld
holyrood
in
those
shifting
days
than
now
when
we
are
dwelling
at
heck
and
manger
we
had
but
little
to
care
and
if
your
majesty
please
to
remember
said
the
goldsmith
the
awful
task
we
had
to
gather
and
enough
to
make
some
show
before
the
spanish
vera
true
said
the
king
now
in
a
full
tide
of
gossip
and
i
mind
not
the
name
of
the
right
leal
lord
that
helped
us
with
every
unce
he
had
in
his
house
that
his
native
prince
might
have
some
credit
in
the
eyes
of
them
that
had
the
indies
at
their
i
think
if
your
majesty
said
the
citizen
will
cast
your
eye
on
the
paper
in
your
hand
you
will
recollect
his
ay
said
the
king
say
ye
sae
man
lord
glenvarloch
that
was
his
name
indeed
et
tenax
a
just
man
but
as
obstinate
as
a
baited
bull
he
stood
whiles
against
us
that
lord
randal
olifaunt
of
glenvarloch
but
he
was
a
loving
and
a
leal
subject
in
the
main
but
this
supplicator
maun
be
his
son
randal
has
been
long
gone
where
king
and
lord
must
go
geordie
as
weel
as
the
like
of
you
and
what
does
his
son
want
with
us
the
settlement
answered
the
citizen
of
a
large
debt
due
by
your
majesty
treasury
for
money
advanced
to
your
majesty
in
great
state
emergency
about
the
time
of
the

the

said
king
james
od
death
man
i
was
just
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
master
of
glamis
and
his
complices
and
there
was
never
siller
mair
welcome
to
a

prince
the
mair
the
shame
and
pity
that
crowned
king
should

serve
ye
for

twa

not

said
george
heriot
and
the
king
who
from
long
experience
was
inured
to
dealing
with
suspicious
creditors
wrote
an
order
upon
george
heriot
his
goldsmith
and
jeweller
for
the
sum
of
two
hundred
pounds
to
be
paid
presently
to

imputed
as

described

catalogue
of

remain
in

of

said

so
forth
until
he
was
lawfully
contented
and
paid
thereof
by
another
rescript
his

gave
the
said
george

directions
to

of

the

answer
this
question
but
believed
the
young

had
studied
he
shall
have
our

said
the

how
to
carry
on
his

invited
by

hospitable
citizen
assembled
at
his
house
in
lombard
street
at
the
hollow
and
hungry
hour
of
noon
to
partake
of
that
meal
which
divides
the
day
being
about
the
time
when
modern
persons
of
fashion
turning
themselves
upon
their
pillow
begin
to
think
not
without
a
great
many
doubts
and
much
hesitation
that
they
will
by
and
by
commence
it
thither
came
the
young
nigel
arrayed
plainly
but
in
a
dress
nevertheless
more
suitable
to
his
age
and
quality
than
he
had
formerly
worn
accompanied
by
his
servant
moniplies
whose
outside
also
was
considerably
improved
his
solemn
and
stern
features
glared
forth
from
under
a
blue
velvet
bonnet
fantastically
placed
sideways
on
his
head
he
had
a
sound
and
tough
coat
of
english
blue
which
unlike
his
former
vestment
would
have
stood
the
tug
of
all
the
apprentices
in
fleet
street
the
buckler
and
broadsword
he
wore
as
the
arms
of
his
condition
and
a
neat
silver
badge
bearing
his
lord
arms
announced
that
he
was
an
appendage
of
aristocracy
he
sat
down
in
the
good
citizen
buttery
not
a
little
pleased
to
find
his
attendance
upon
the
table
in
the
hall
was
likely
to
be
rewarded
with
his
share
of
a
meal
such
as
he
had
seldom
partaken
of
david
ramsay
that
profound
and
ingenious
mechanic
was
safely
conducted
to
lombard
street
according
to
promise
well
washed
brushed
and
cleaned
from
the
soot
of
the
furnace
and
the
forge
his
daughter
who
came
with
him
was
about
twenty
years
old
very
pretty
very
demure
yet
with
lively
black
eyes
that
ever
and
anon
contradicted
the
expression
of
sobriety
to
which
silence
reserve
a
plain
velvet
hood
and
a
cambric
ruff
had
condemned
mistress
marget
as
the
daughter
of
a
quiet
citizen
there
were
also
two
citizens
and
merchants
of
london
men
ample
in
cloak
and
golden
chain
well
to
pass
in
the
world
and
experienced
in
their
craft
of
merchandise
but
who
require
no
particular
description
there
was
an
elderly
clergyman
also
in
his
gown
and
cassock
a
decent
venerable
man
partaking
in
his
manners
of
the
plainness
of
the
citizens
amongst
whom
he
had
his
cure
these
may
be
dismissed
with
brief
notice
but
not
so
sir
mungo
malagrowther
of
girnigo
castle
who
claims
a
little
more
attention
as
an
original
character
of
the
time
in
which
he
flourished
that
good
knight
knocked
at
master
heriot
door
just
as
the
clock
began
to
strike
twelve
and
was
seated
in
his
chair
ere
the
last
stroke
had
chimed
this
gave
the
knight
an
excellent
opportunity
of
making
sarcastic
observations
on
all
who
came
later
than
himself
not
to
mention
a
few
rubs
at
the
expense
of
those
who
had
been
so
superfluous
as
to
appear
earlier
having
little
or
no
property
save
his
bare
designation
sir
mungo
had
been
early
attached
to
court
in
the
capacity
of
as
the
office
was
then
called
to
king
james
the
sixth
and
with
his
majesty
trained
to
all
polite
learning
by
his
celebrated
preceptor
george
buchanan
the
office
of
doomed
its
unfortunate
occupant
to
undergo
all
the
corporeal
punishment
which
the
lord
anointed
whose
proper
person
was
of
course
sacred
might
chance
to
incur
in
the
course
of
travelling
through
his
grammar
and
prosody
under
the
stern
rule
indeed
of
george
buchanan
who
did
not
approve
of
the
vicarious
mode
of
punishment
james
bore
the
penance
of
his
own
faults
and
mungo
malagrowther
enjoyed
a
sinecure
but
james
other
pedagogue
master
patrick
young
went
more
ceremoniously
to
work
and
appalled
the
very
soul
of
the
youthful
king
by
the
floggings
which
he
bestowed
on
the
when
the
royal
task
was
not
suitably
performed
and
be
it
told
to
sir
mungo
praise
that
there
were
points
about
him
in
the
highest
respect
suited
to
his
official
situation
he
had
even
in
youth
a
naturally
irregular
and
grotesque
set
of
features
which
when
distorted
by
fear
pain
and
anger
looked
like
one
of
the
whimsical
faces
which
present
themselves
in
a
gothic
cornice
his
voice
also
was
and
querulous
so
that
when
smarting
under
master
peter
unsparing
inflictions
the
expression
of
his
grotesque
physiognomy
and
the
superhuman
yells
which
he
uttered
were
well
suited
to
produce
all
the
effects
on
the
monarch
who
deserved
the
lash
that
could
possibly
be
produced
by
seeing
another
and
an
innocent
individual
suffering
for
his
delict
sir
mungo
malagrowther
for
such
he
became
thus
got
an
early
footing
at
court
which
another
would
have
improved
and
maintained
but
when
he
grew
too
big
to
be
whipped
he
had
no
other
means
of
rendering
himself
acceptable
a
bitter
caustic
and
backbiting
humour
a
malicious
wit
and
an
envy
of
others
more
prosperous
than
the
possessor
of
such
amiable
qualities
have
not
indeed
always
been
found
obstacles
to
a
rise
but
then
they
must
be
amalgamated
with
a
degree
of
selfish
cunning
and
prudence
of
which
sir
mungo
had
no
share
his
satire
ran
riot
his
envy
could
not
conceal
itself
and
it
was
not
long
after
his
majority
till
he
had
as
many
quarrels
upon
his
hands
as
would
have
required
a
cat
nine
lives
to
answer
in
one
of
these
rencontres
he
received
perhaps
we
should
say
fortunately
a
wound
which
served
him
as
an
excuse
for
answering
no
invitations
of
the
kind
in
future
sir
rullion
rattray
of
ranagullion
cut
off
in
mortal
combat
three
of
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
so
that
sir
mungo
never
could
hold
sword
again
at
a
later
period
having
written
some
satirical
verses
upon
the
lady
cockpen
he
received
so
severe
a
chastisement
from
some
persons
employed
for
the
purpose
that
he
was
found
half
dead
on
the
spot
where
they
had
thus
dealt
with
him
and
one
of
his
thighs
having
been
broken
and
ill
set
gave
him
a
hitch
in
his
gait
with
which
he
hobbled
to
his
grave
the
lameness
of
his
leg
and
hand
besides
that
they
added
considerably
to
the
grotesque
appearance
of
this
original
procured
him
in
future
a
personal
immunity
from
the
more
dangerous
consequences
of
his
own
humour
and
he
gradually
grew
old
in
the
service
of
the
court
in
safety
of
life
and
limb
though
without
either
making
friends
or
attaining
preferment
sometimes
indeed
the
king
was
amused
with
his
caustic
sallies
but
he
had
never
art
enough
to
improve
the
favourable
opportunity
and
his
enemies
who
were
for
that
matter
the
whole
court
always
found
means
to
throw
him
out
of
favour
again
the
celebrated
archie
armstrong
offered
sir
mungo
in
his
generosity
a
skirt
of
his
own
fool
coat
proposing
thereby
to
communicate
to
him
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
a
professed
jester
for
said
the
man
of
motley
sir
mungo
as
he
goes
on
just
now
gets
no
more
for
a
good
jest
than
just
the
king
pardon
for
having
made
even
in
london
the
golden
shower
which
fell
around
him
did
not
moisten
the
blighted
fortunes
of
sir
mungo
malagrowther
he
grew
old
deaf
and
peevish
lost
even
the
spirit
which
had
formerly
animated
his
strictures
and
was
barely
endured
by
james
who
though
himself
nearly
as
far
stricken
in
years
retained
to
an
unusual
and
even
an
absurd
degree
the
desire
to
be
surrounded
by
young
people
sir
mungo
thus
fallen
into
the
yellow
leaf
of
years
and
fortune
showed
his
emaciated
form
and
faded
embroidery
at
court
as
seldom
as
his
duty
permitted
and
spent
his
time
in
indulging
his
food
for
satire
in
the
public
walks
and
in
the
aisles
of
saint
paul
which
were
then
the
general
resort
of
newsmongers
and
characters
of
all
descriptions
associating
himself
chiefly
with
such
of
his
countrymen
as
he
accounted
of
inferior
birth
and
rank
to
himself
in
this
manner
hating
and
contemning
commerce
and
those
who
pursued
it
he
nevertheless
lived
a
good
deal
among
the
scottish
artists
and
merchants
who
had
followed
the
court
to
london
to
these
he
could
show
his
cynicism
without
much
offence
for
some
submitted
to
his
jeers
and
in
deference
to
his
birth
and
knighthood
which
in
those
days
conferred
high
privileges
and
others
of
more
sense
pitied
and
endured
the
old
man
unhappy
alike
in
his
fortunes
and
his
temper
amongst
the
latter
was
george
heriot
who
though
his
habits
and
education
induced
him
to
carry
aristocratical
feelings
to
a
degree
which
would
now
be
thought
extravagant
had
too
much
spirit
and
good
sense
to
permit
himself
to
be
intruded
upon
to
an
unauthorized
excess
or
used
with
the
slightest
improper
freedom
by
such
a
person
as
sir
mungo
to
whom
he
was
nevertheless
not
only
respectfully
civil
but
essentially
kind
and
even
generous
accordingly
this
appeared
from
the
manner
in
which
sir
mungo
malagrowther
conducted
himself
upon
entering
the
apartment
he
paid
his
respects
to
master
heriot
and
a
decent
elderly
somewhat
female
in
a
coif
who
by
the
name
of
aunt
judith
did
the
honours
of
his
house
and
table
with
little
or
no
portion
of
the
supercilious
acidity
which
his
singular
physiognomy
assumed
when
he
made
his
bow
successively
to
david
ramsay
and
the
two
sober
citizens
he
thrust
himself
into
the
conversation
of
the
latter
to
observe
he
had
heard
in
paul
that
the
bankrupt
concern
of
pindivide
a
great
merchant
who
as
he
expressed
it
had
given
the
crows
a
pudding
and
on
whom
he
knew
from
the
same
authority
each
of
the
honest
citizens
has
some
unsettled
claim
was
like
to
prove
a
total
loss
stock
and
block
ship
and
cargo
keel
and
rigging
all
lost
now
and
for
the
two
citizens
grinned
at
each
other
but
too
prudent
to
make
their
private
affairs
the
subject
of
public
discussion
drew
their
heads
together
and
evaded
farther
conversation
by
speaking
in
a
whisper
the
old
scots
knight
next
attacked
the
watchmaker
with
the
same
disrespectful
davie
he
said
davie
ye
donnard
auld
idiot
have
ye
no
gane
mad
yet
with
applying
your
mathematical
science
as
ye
call
it
to
the
book
of
apocalypse
i
expected
to
have
heard
ye
make
out
the
sign
of
the
beast
as
clear
as
a
tout
on
a
bawbee
why
sir
mungo
said
the
mechanist
after
making
an
effort
to
recall
to
his

what
had
been
said
to
him
and
by
whom
it
may
be
that
ye
are
nearer
the
mark
than
ye
are
yoursell
aware
of

my

you

exclaimed
sir
mungo
while
betwixt
jest
and
earnest
he
laid
on
his
hilt
his
hand
or
rather
his
claw
for
sir
rullion
broadsword
has
abridged
it
into
that
form
d
mean
to
upbraid
me
with
my
mutilation
master
heriot
interfered
i
can
not
persuade
our
friend
david
he
said
that
scriptural
prophecies
are
intended
to
remain
in
obscurity
until
their
unexpected
accomplishment
shall
make
as
in
former
days
that
fulfilled
which
was
written
but
you
must
not
exert
your
knightly
valour
on
him
for
all
by
my
saul
and
it
would
be
throwing
it
away
said
sir
mungo
laughing
i
would
as
soon
set
out
with
hound
and
horn
to
hunt
a
sturdied
sheep
for
he
is
in
a
doze
again
and
up
to
the
chin
in
numerals
quotients
and
mistress
margaret
my
pretty
honey
for
the
beauty
of
the
young
citizen
made
even
sir
mungo
malagrowther
grim
features
relax
themselves
a
little
is
your
father
always
as
entertaining
as
he
seems
just
now
mistress
margaret
simpered
bridled
looked
to
either
side
then
straight
before
her
and
having
assumed
all
the
airs
of
bashful
embarrassment
and
timidity
which
were
necessary
as
she
thought
to
cover
a
certain
shrewd
readiness
which
really
belonged
to
her
character
at
length
replied
that
indeed
her
father
was
very
thoughtful
but
she
had
heard
that
he
took
the
habit
of
mind
from
her
your
grandfather
said
sir
mungo
after
doubting
if
he
had
heard
her
aright
said
she
her
grandfather
the
lassie
is
distraught
i
ken
nae
wench
on
this
side
of
temple
bar
that
is
derived
from
so
distant
a
she
has
got
a
godfather
however
sir
mungo
said
george
heriot
again
interfering
and
i
hope
you
will
allow
him
interest
enough
with
you
to
request
you
will
not
put
his
pretty
godchild
to
so
deep
a
the
better
the
better
said
sir
mungo
it
is
a
credit
to
her
that
bred
and
born
within
the
sound
of
she
can
blush
for
any
thing
and
by
my
saul
master
george
he
continued
chucking
the
irritated
and
reluctant
damsel
under
the
chin
she
is
bonny
enough
to
make
amends
for
her
lack
of
ancestry
at
least
in
such
a
region
as
cheapside
where
d
mind
me
the
kettle
can
not
call
the
the
damsel
blushed
but
not
so
angrily
as
before
master
george
heriot
hastened
to
interrupt
the
conclusion
of
sir
mungo
homely
proverb
by
introducing
him
personally
to
lord
nigel
sir
mungo
could
not
at
first
understand
what
his
host
said
bread
of
heaven
wha
say
ye
man
upon
the
name
of
nigel
olifaunt
lord
glenvarloch
being
again
hollowed
into
his
ear
he
drew
up
and
regarding
his
entertainer
with
some
austerity
rebuked
him
for
not
making
persons
of
quality
acquainted
with
each
other
that
they
might
exchange
courtesies
before
they
mingled
with
other
folks
he
then
made
as
handsome
and
courtly
a
congee
to
his
new
acquaintance
as
a
man
maimed
in
foot
and
hand
could
do
and
observing
he
had
known
my
lord
his
father
bid
him
welcome
to
london
and
hoped
he
should
see
him
at
court
nigel
in
an
instant
comprehended
as
well
from
sir
mungo
manner
as
from
a
strict
compression
of
their
entertainer
lips
which
intimated
the
suppression
of
a
desire
to
laugh
that
he
was
dealing
with
an
original
of
no
ordinary
description
and
accordingly
returned
his
courtesy
with
suitable
punctiliousness
sir
mungo
in
the
meanwhile
gazed
on
him
with
much
earnestness
and
as
the
contemplation
of
natural
advantages
was
as
odious
to
him
as
that
of
wealth
or
other
adventitious
benefits
he
had
no
sooner
completely
perused
the
handsome
form
and
good
features
of
the
young
lord
than
like
one
of
the
comforters
of
the
man
of
uz
he
drew
close
up
to
him
to
enlarge
on
the
former
grandeur
of
the
lords
of
glenvarloch
and
the
regret
with
which
he
had
heard
that
their
representative
was
not
likely
to
possess
the
domains
of
his
ancestry
anon
he
enlarged
upon
the
beauties
of
the
principal
mansion
of
glenvarloch
the
commanding
site
of
the
old
castle
the
noble
expanse
of
the
lake
stocked
with
wildfowl
for
hawking
the
commanding
screen
of
forest
terminating
in
a
abounding
with
deer
and
all
the
other
advantages
of
that
fine
and
ancient
barony
till
nigel
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
the
contrary
was
unwillingly
obliged
to
sigh
sir
mungo
skilful
in
discerning
when
the
withers
of
those
he
conversed
with
were
wrung
observed
that
his
new
acquaintance
winced
and
would
willingly
have
pressed
the
discussion
but
the
cook
impatient
knock
upon
the
dresser
with
the
haft
of
his
now
gave
a
signal
loud
enough
to
be
heard
from
the
top
of
the
house
to
the
bottom
summoning
at
the
same
time
the
to
place
the
dinner
upon
the
table
and
the
guests
to
partake
of
it
sir
mungo
who
was
an
admirer
of
good
cheer
a
taste
which
by
the
way
might
have
some
weight
in
reconciling
his
dignity
to
these
city
visits
was
tolled
off
by
the
sound
and
left
nigel
and
the
other
guests
in
peace
until
his
anxiety
to
arrange
himself
in
his
due
place
of
at
the
genial
board
was
duly
gratified
here
seated
on
the
left
hand
of
aunt
judith
he
beheld
nigel
occupy
the
station
of
yet
higher
honour
on
the
right
dividing
that
matron
from
pretty
mistress
margaret
but
he
saw
this
with
the
more
patience
that
there
stood
betwixt
him
and
the
young
lord
a
superb
larded
capon
the
dinner
proceeded
according
to
the
form
of
the
times
all
was
excellent
of
the
kind
and
besides
the
scottish
cheer
promised
the
board
displayed
beef
and
pudding
the
statutory
dainties
of
old
england
a
small
cupboard
of
plate
very
choicely
and
beautifully
wrought
did
not
escape
the
compliments
of
some
of
the
company
and
an
oblique
sneer
from
sir
mungo
as
intimating
the
owner
excellence
in
his
own
mechanical
craft
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
workmanship
sir
mungo
said
the
honest
citizen
they
say
a
good
cook
knows
how
to
lick
his
own
fingers
and
methinks
it
were
unseemly
that
i
who
have
furnished
half
the
cupboards
in
broad
britain
should
have
my
own
covered
with
paltry
the
blessing
of
the
clergyman
now
left
the
guests
at
liberty
to
attack
what
was
placed
before
them
and
the
meal
went
forward
with
great
decorum
until
aunt
judith
in
farther
recommendation
of
the
capon
assured
her
company
that
it
was
of
a
celebrated
breed
of
poultry
which
she
had
herself
brought
from
scotland
then
like
some
of
his
countrymen
madam
said
the
pitiless
sir
mungo
not
without
a
glance
towards
his
landlord
he
has
been
well
larded
in
there
are
some
others
of
his
countrymen
answered
master
heriot
to
whom
all
the
lard
in
england
has
not
been
able
to
render
that
good
sir
mungo
sneered
and
reddened
the
rest
of
the
company
laughed
and
the
satirist
who
had
his
reasons
for
not
coming
to
extremity
with
master
george
was
silent
for
the
rest
of
the
dinner
the
dishes
were
exchanged
for
confections
and
wine
of
the
highest
quality
and
flavour
and
nigel
saw
the
entertainments
of
the
wealthiest
burgomasters
which
he
had
witnessed
abroad
fairly
outshone
by
the
hospitality
of
a
london
citizen
yet
there
was
nothing
ostentatious
or
which
seemed
inconsistent
with
the
degree
of
an
opulent
burgher
while
the
collation
proceeded
nigel
according
to
the
of
the
time
addressed
his
discourse
principally
to
judith
whom
he
found
to
be
a
woman
of
a
strong
scottish
understanding
more
inclined
towards
the
puritans
than
was
her
brother
george
for
in
that
relation
she
stood
to
him
though
he
always
called
her
aunt
attached
to
him
in
the
strongest
degree
and
sedulously
attentive
to
all
his
comforts
as
the
conversation
of
this
good
dame
was
neither
lively
nor
fascinating
the
young
lord
naturally
addressed
himself
next
to
the
old
very
pretty
daughter
who
sat
upon
his
left
hand
from
her
however
there
was
no
extracting
any
reply
beyond
the
measure
of
a
monosyllable
and
when
the
young
gallant
had
said
the
best
and
most
complaisant
things
which
his
courtesy
supplied
the
smile
that
mantled
upon
her
pretty
mouth
was
so
slight
and
evanescent
as
scarce
to
be
discernible
nigel
was
beginning
to
tire
of
his
company
for
the
old
citizens
were
speaking
with
his
host
of
commercial
matters
in
language
to
him
totally
unintelligible
when
sir
mungo
malagrowther
suddenly
summoned
their
attention
that
amiable
personage
had
for
some
time
withdrawn
from
the
company
into
the
recess
of
a
projecting
window
so
formed
and
placed
as
to
command
a
view
of
the
door
of
the
house
and
of
the
street
this
situation
was
probably
preferred
by
sir
mungo
on
account
of
the
number
of
objects
which
the
streets
of
a
metropolis
usually
offer
of
a
kind
congenial
to
the
thoughts
of
a
splenetic
man
what
he
had
hitherto
seen
passing
there
was
probably
of
little
consequence
but
now
a
trampling
of
horse
was
heard
without
and
the
knight
suddenly
exclaimed
by
my
faith
master
george
you
had
better
go
look
to
shop
for
here
comes
knighton
the
duke
of
buckingham
groom
and
two
fellows
after
him
as
if
he
were
my
lord
duke
my
is
below
said
heriot
without
disturbing
himself
and
he
will
let
me
know
if
his
grace
commands
require
my
immediate
umph
muttered
sir
mungo
to
himself
he
would
have
had
an
easy
office
when
i
first
kend
but
said
he
speaking
aloud
will
you
not
come
to
the
window
at
least
for
knighton
has
trundled
a
piece
of
into
your
house
ha
ha
ha
trundled
it
upon
its
edge
as
a
callan
would
drive
a
hoop
i
can
not
help
laughing
ha
ha
ha
at
the
fellow
i
believe
you
could
not
help
laughing
said
george
heriot
rising
up
and
leaving
the
room
if
your
best
friend
lay
bitter
that
my
lord
ha
said
sir
mungo
addressing
nigel
our
friend
is
not
a
goldsmith
for
nothing
he
hath
no
leaden
wit
but
i
will
go
down
and
see
what
comes
heriot
as
he
descended
the
stairs
met
his
coming
up
with
some
concern
in
his
why
how
now
roberts
said
the
goldsmith
what
means
all
this
man
it
is
knighton
master
heriot
from
the
court
knighton
the
man
he
brought
back
the
salver
you
carried
to
whitehall
flung
it
into
the
entrance
as
if
it
had
been
an
old
pewter
platter
and
bade
me
tell
you
the
king
would
have
none
of
your
ay
indeed
said
george
heriot
none
of
my
trumpery
come
hither
into
the
sir
mungo
he
added
bowing
to
the
knight
who
had
joined
and
was
preparing
to
follow
them
i
pray
your
forgiveness
for
an
in
virtue
of
this
prohibition
sir
mungo
who
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
company
had
overheard
what
passed
betwixt
george
heriot
and
his
saw
himself
condemned
to
wait
in
the
outer
where
he
would
have
endeavoured
to
slake
his
eager
curiosity
by
questioning
knighton
but
that
emissary
of
greatness
after
having
added
to
the
uncivil
message
of
his
master
some
rudeness
of
his
own
had
again
scampered
westward
with
his
satellites
at
his
heels
in
the
meanwhile
the
name
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
the
omnipotent
favourite
both
of
the
king
and
the
prince
of
wales
had
struck
some
anxiety
into
the
party
which
remained
in
the
great
parlour
he
was
more
feared
than
beloved
and
if
not
absolutely
of
a
tyrannical
disposition
was
accounted
haughty
violent
and
vindictive
it
pressed
on
heart
that
he
himself
though
he
could
not
conceive
how
nor
why
might
be
the
original
cause
of
the
resentment
of
the
duke
against
his
benefactor
the
others
made
their
comments
in
whispers
until
the
sounds
reached
ramsay
who
had
not
heard
a
word
of
what
had
previously
passed
but
plunged
in
those
studies
with
which
he
connected
every
other
incident
and
event
took
up
only
the
catchword
and
replied
the
duke
the
duke
of
buckingham
george
villiers
ay
i
have
spoke
with
lambe
about
our
lord
and
our
lady
now
how
can
you
say
so

said
his
daughter
who
had
shrewdness
enough
to
see
that
her
father
was
touching
upon
dangerous
ground
why

answered
ramsay
the
stars
do

they
can
not

but
well
you
wot
it
is
commonly
said
of
his
grace
by
those
who
have
the
skill
to
cast
nativities
that
there
was
a
notable
conjunction
of
mars
and
saturn
the
apparent
or
true
time
of
which
reducing
the
calculations
of
eichstadius

seven
hours

and

hold
your
peace
old
soothsayer
said
heriot
who
at
that
instant
entered
the
room
with
a
calm
and
steady
countenance
your
calculations
are
true
and
undeniable
when
they
regard
brass
and
wire
and
mechanical
force
but
future
events
are
at
the
pleasure
of
him
who

george
answered
the

there
was
a
concurrence
of
signs
at
this
gentleman
birth
which
showed
his
course
would
be
a
strange
one
long
has
it
been
said
of
him
he
was
born
at

very
meeting
of

under

it

that

who
at
the

time
put
upon
her
slender
finger
a
ring
of
much
taste
and
some
value
for

seldom
suffered
her
to
leave
him
without
some
token
of
his
affection
thus
honourably
dismissed
and
accompanied
by

street
sir
mungo
had
bid
adieu
to
master
heriot
as
he
came
out
from
the
back
but
such
was
the
interest
which
he
took
in
the
affairs
of
his
friend
that
when
master
george
went
upstairs
he
could
not
help
walking
into
that
sanctum
sanctorum
to
see
how
master
roberts
was
employed
the
knight
found
the
busy
in
making
extracts
from
those
huge
manuscript
folios
which
are
the
pride
and
trust
of
dealers
and
the
dread
of
customers
whose
year
of
grace
is
out
the
good
knight
leant
his
elbows
on
the
desk
and
said
to
the
functionary
in
a
condoling
tone
of
voice
what
you
have
lost
a
good
customer
i
fear
master
roberts
and
are
busied
in
making
out
his
bill
of
charges
now
it
chanced
that
roberts
like
sir
mungo
himself
was
a
little
deaf
and
like
sir
mungo
knew
also
how
to
make
the
most
of
it
so
that
he
answered
at
cross
purposes
i
humbly
crave
your
pardon
sir
mungo
for
not
having
sent
in
your
bill
of
charge
sooner
but
my
master
bade
me
not
disturb
you
i
will
bring
the
items
together
in

saying
he
began
to
turn
over

not
dealing

would
have
proceeded
but
sir
mungo
not
prepared
to
endure
the
recital
of
the
catalogue
of
his
own
petty
debts
and
still
less
willing
to
satisfy
them
on
the
spot
wished
the
bookkeeper
cavalierly
and
left
the
house
without
farther
ceremony
the
clerk
looked
after
him
with
a
civil
city
sneer
and
immediately
resumed
the
more
serious
labours
which
sir
mungo
intrusion
had
interrupted
chapter

things
needful
we
have
thought
on
but
the
thing
of
all
most
needful
that
which
scripture
terms
as
if
alone
it
merited
regard
the
one
thing
needful
that
yet
unconsider
when
the
rest
of
the
company
had
taken
their
departure
from
master
heriot
house
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
also
offered
to
take
leave
but
his
host
detained
him
for
a
few
minutes
until
all
were
gone
excepting
the
clergyman
my
lord
then
said
the
worthy
citizen
we
have
had
our
permitted
hour
of
honest
and
hospitable
pastime
and
now
i
would
fain
delay
you
for
another
and
graver
purpose
as
it
is
our
custom
when
we
have
the
benefit
of
good
windsor
company
that
he
reads
the
prayers
of
the
church
for
the
evening
before
we
separate
your
excellent
father
my
lord
would
not
have
departed
before
family
worship
i
hope
the
same
from
your
with
pleasure
sir
answered
nigel
and
you
add
in
the
invitation
an
additional
obligation
to
those
with
which
you
have
loaded
me
when
young
men
forget
what
is
their
duty
they
owe
deep
thanks
to
the
friend
who
will
remind
them
of
while
they
talked
together
in
this
manner
the
had
removed
the
brought
forward
a
portable
and
placed
chairs
and
hassocks
for
their
master
their
mistress
and
the
noble
stranger
another
low
chair
or
rather
a
sort
of
stool
was
placed
close
beside
that
of
master
heriot
and
though
the
circumstance
was
trivial
nigel
was
induced
to
notice
it
because
when
about
to
occupy
that
seat
he
was
prevented
by
a
sign
from
the
old
gentleman
and
motioned
to
another
of
somewhat
more
elevation
the
clergyman
took
his
station
behind
the
the
domestics
a
numerous
family
both
of
clerks
and
servants
including
moniplies
attended
with
great
gravity
and
were
accommodated
with
benches
the
household
were
all
seated
and
externally
at
least
composed
to
devout
attention
when
a
low
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
judith
looked
anxiously
at
her
brother
as
if
desiring
to
know
his
pleasure
he
nodded
his
head
gravely
and
looked
to
the
door
judith
immediately
crossed
the
chamber
opened
the
door
and
led
into
the
apartment
a
beautiful
creature
whose
sudden
and
singular
appearance
might
have
made
her
almost
pass
for
an
apparition
she
was
deadly
was
not
the
least
shade
of
vital
red
to
enliven
features
which
were
exquisitely
formed
and
might
but
for
that
circumstance
have
been
termed
transcendently
beautiful
her
long
black
hair
fell
down
over
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
combed
smoothly
and
regularly
but
without
the
least
appearance
of
decoration
or
ornament
which
looked
very
singular
at
a
period
when
as
it
was
called
of
one
sort
or
other
was
generally
used
by
all
ranks
her
dress
was
of
white
of
the
simplest
fashion
and
hiding
all
her
person
excepting
the
throat
face
and
hands
her
form
was
rather
beneath
than
above
the
middle
size
but
so
justly
proportioned
and
elegantly
made
that
the
spectator
attention
was
entirely
withdrawn
from
her
size
in
contradiction
of
the
extreme
plainness
of
all
the
rest
of
her
attire
she
wore
a
necklace
which
a
duchess
might
have
envied
so
large
and
lustrous
were
the
brilliants
of
which
it
was
composed
and
around
her
waist
a
zone
of
rubies
of
scarce
inferior
value
when
this
singular
figure
entered
the
apartment
she
cast
her
eyes
on
nigel
and
paused
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
the
glance
which
she
took
of
him
seemed
to
be
one
rather
of
uncertainty
and
hesitation
than
of
bashfulness
or
timidity
aunt
judith
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
slowly
forward
her
dark
eyes
however
continued
to
be
fixed
on
nigel
with
an
expression
of
melancholy
by
which
he
felt
strangely
affected
even
when
she
was
seated
on
the
vacant
stool
which
was
placed
there
probably
for
her
accommodation
she
again
looked
on
him
more
than
once
with
the
same
pensive
lingering
and
anxious
expression
but
without
either
shyness
or
embarrassment
not
even
so
much
as
to
call
the
slightest
degree
of
complexion
into
her
cheek
so
soon
as
this
singular
female
had
taken
up
the
which
was
laid
upon
her
cushion
she
seemed
immersed
in
devotional
duty
and
although
nigel
attention
to
the
service
was
so
much
disturbed
by
this
extraordinary
apparition
that
he
looked
towards
her
repeatedly
in
the
course
of
the
service
he
could
never
observe
that
her
eyes
or
her
thoughts
strayed
so
much
as
a
single
moment
from
the
task
in
which
she
was
engaged
nigel
himself
was
less
attentive
for
the
appearance
of
this
lady
seemed
so
extraordinary
that
strictly
as
he
had
been
bred
up
by
his
father
to
pay
the
most
reverential
attention
during
performance
of
divine
service
his
thoughts
in
spite
of
himself
were
disturbed
by
her
presence
and
he
earnestly
wished
the
prayers
were
ended
that
his
curiosity
might
obtain
some
gratification
when
the
service
was
concluded
and
each
had
remained
according
to
the
decent
and
edifying
practice
of
the
church
concentrated
in
mental
devotion
for
a
short
space
the
mysterious
visitant
arose
ere
any
other
person
stirred
and
nigel
remarked
that
none
of
the
domestics
left
their
places
oreven
moved
until
she
had
first
kneeled
on
one
knee
to
heriot
who
seemed
to
bless
her
with
his
hand
laid
on
her
head
and
a
melancholy
solemnity
of
look
and
action
she
then
bended
her
body
but
without
kneeling
to
judith
and
having
performed
these
two
acts
of
reverence
she
left
the
room
yet
just
in
the
act
of
her
departure
she
once
more
turned
her
penetrating
eyes
on
nigel
with
a
fixed
look
which
compelled
him
to
turn
his
own
aside
when
he
looked
towards
her
again
he
saw
only
the
skirt
of
her
white
mantle
as
she
left
the
apartment
the
domestics
then
rose
and
dispersed
themselves
wine
and
fruit
and
spices
were
offered
to
lord
nigel
and
to
the
clergyman
and
the
latter
took
his
leave
the
young
lord
would
fain
have
accompanied
him
in
hope
to
get
some
explanation
of
the
apparition
which
he
had
beheld
but
he
was
stopped
by
his
host
who
requested
to
speak
with
him
in
his
i
hope
my
lord
said
the
citizen
that
your
preparations
for
attending
court
are
in
such
forwardness
that
you
can
go
thither
the
day
after
it
is
perhaps
the
last
day
for
some
time
that
his
majesty
will
hold
open
court
for
all
who
have
pretensions
by
birth
rank
or
office
to
attend
upon
him
on
the
subsequent
day
he
goes
to
theobald
where
he
is
so
much
occupied
with
hunting
and
other
pleasures
that
he
cares
not
to
be
intruded
i
shall
be
in
all
outward
readiness
to
pay
my
duty
said
the
young
nobleman
yet
i
have
little
heart
to
do
it
the
friends
from
whom
i
ought
to
have
found
encouragement
and
protection
have
proved
cold
and
false
i
certainly
will
not
trouble
for
their
countenance
on
this
occasion
and
yet
i
must
confess
my
childish
unwillingness
to
enter
quite
alone
upon
so
new
a
it
is
bold
of
a
mechanic
like
me
to
make
such
an
offer
to
a
nobleman
said
heriot
but
i
must
attend
at
court
i
can
accompany
you
as
far
as
the
from
my
privilege
as
being
of
the
household
i
can
facilitate
your
entrance
should
you
find
difficulty
and
i
can
point
out
the
proper
manner
and
time
of
approaching
the
king
but
i
do
not
know
he
added
smiling
whether
these
little
advantages
will
not
be
overbalanced
by
the
incongruity
of
a
nobleman
receiving
them
from
the
hands
of
an
old
from
the
hands
rather
of
the
only
friend
i
have
found
in
london
said
nigel
offering
his
hand
nay
if
you
think
of
the
matter
in
that
way
replied
the
honest
citizen
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
i
will
come
for
you
with
a
barge
proper
to
the
but
remember
my
good
young
lord
that
i
do
not
like
some
men
of
my
degree
wish
to
take
opportunity
to
step
beyond
it
and
associate
with
my
superiors
in
rank
and
therefore
do
not
fear
to
mortify
my
presumption
by
suffering
me
to
keep
my
distance
in
the
presence
and
where
it
is
fitting
for
both
of
us
to
separate
and
for
what
remains
most
truly
happy
shall
i
be
in
proving
of
service
to
the
son
of
my
ancient
the
style
of
conversation
led
so
far
from
the
point
which
had
interested
the
young
nobleman
curiosity
that
there
was
no
returning
to
it
that
night
he
therefore
exchanged
thanks
and
greetings
with
george
heriot
and
took
his
leave
promising
to
be
equipped
and
in
readiness
to
embark
with
him
on
the
second
successive
morning
at
ten
the
generation
of
linkboys
celebrated
by
count
anthony
hamilton
as
peculiar
to
london
had
already
in
the
reign
of
james
begun
their
functions
and
the
service
of
one
of
them
with
his
smoky
torch
had
been
secured
to
light
the
young
scottish
lord
and
his
follower
to
their
lodgings
which
though
better
acquainted
than
formerly
with
the
city
they
might
in
the
dark
have
run
some
danger
of
missing
this
gave
the
ingenious
moniplies
an
opportunity
of
gathering
close
up
to
his
master
after
he
had
gone
through
the
form
of
slipping
his
left
arm
into
the
handles
of
his
buckler
and
loosening
his
broadsword
in
the
sheath
that
he
might
be
ready
for
whatever
should
befall
if
it
were
not
for
the
wine
and
the
good
cheer
which
we
have
had
in
yonder
old
man
house
my
lord
said
this
sapient
follower
and
that
i
ken
him
by
report
to
be
a
just
living
man
in
many
respects
and
a
real
edinburgh
gutterblood
i
should
have
been
well
pleased
to
have
seen
how
his
feet
were
shaped
and
whether
he
had
not
a
cloven
cloot
under
the
braw
roses
and
cordovan
shoon
of
why
you
rascal
answered
nigel
you
have
been
too
kindly
treated
and
now
that
you
have
filled
your
ravenous
stomach
you
are
railing
on
the
good
gentleman
that
relieved
under
favour
no
my
lord
said
moniplies
i
would
only
like
to
see
something
mair
about
him
i
have
eaten
his
meat
it
is
true
more
shame
that
the
like
of
him
should
have
meat
to
give
when
your
lordship
and
me
could
scarce
have
gotten
on
our
own
account
brose
and
a
bear
bannock
i
have
drunk
his
wine
i
see
you
have
replied
his
master
a
great
deal
more
than
you
should
have
under
your
patience
my
lord
said
moniplies
you
are
pleased
to
say
that
because
i
crushed
a
quart
with
that
jolly
boy
jenkin
as
they
call
the
boy
and
that
was
out
of
mere
acknowledgment
for
his
former
kindness
i
own
that
i
moreover
sung
the
good
old
song
of
elsie
marley
so
as
they
never
heard
it
chanted
in
their
lives
and
withal
as
john
bunyan
says
as
they
went
on
their
way
he
sung
o
do
ye
ken
elsie
marley
honey
the
wife
that
sells
the
barley
honey
for
elsie
marley
grown
sae
fine
she
winna
get
up
to
feed
the
o
do
ye
ken
here
in
mid
career
was
the
songster
interrupted
by
the
stern
gripe
of
his
master
who
threatened
to
baton
him
to
death
if
he
brought
the
upon
them
by
his
melody
i
crave
pardon
my
lord
i
humbly
crave
pardon
only
when
i
think
of
that
jen
win
as
they
call
him
i
can
hardly
help
humming
do
ye
ken
but
i
crave
your
honour
pardon
and
will
be
totally
dumb
if
you
command
me
no
sirrah
said
nigel
talk
on
for
i
well
know
you
would
say
and
suffer
more
under
pretence
of
holding
your
peace
than
when
you
get
an
unbridled
license
how
is
it
then
what
have
you
to
say
against
master
heriot
it
seems
more
than
probable
that
in
permitting
this
license
the
young
lord
hoped
his
attendant
would
stumble
upon
the
subject
of
the
young
lady
who
had
appeared
at
prayers
in
a
manner
so
mysterious
but
whether
this
was
the
case
or
whether
he
merely
desired
that
moniplies
should
utter
in
a
subdued
and
under
tone
of
voice
those
spirits
which
might
otherwise
have
vented
themselves
in
obstreperous
song
it
is
certain
he
permitted
his
attendant
to
proceed
with
his
story
in
his
own
way
and
therefore
said
the
orator
availing
himself
of
his
immunity
i
would
like
to
ken
what
sort
of
carle
this
maister
heriot
is
he
hath
supplied
your
lordship
with
wealth
of
gold
as
i
can
understand
and
if
he
has
i
make
it
for
certain
he
hath
had
his
ain
end
in
it
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
world
now
had
your
lordship
your
own
good
lands
at
your
guiding
doubtless
this
person
with
most
of
his
craft
goldsmiths
they
call
themselves
i
say
usurers
wad
be
glad
to
exchange
so
many
pounds
of
african
dust
by
whilk
i
understand
gold
against
so
many
fair
acres
and
hundreds
of
acres
of
broad
scottish
but
you
know
i
have
no
land
said
the
young
lord
at
least
none
that
can
be
affected
by
any
debt
which
i
can
at
present
become
obliged
for
i
think
you
need
not
have
reminded
me
of
true
my
lord
most
true
and
as
your
lordship
says
open
to
the
meanest
capacity
without
any
unnecessary
expositions
now
therefore
my
lord
unless
maister
george
heriot
has
something
mair
to
allege
as
a
motive
for
his
liberality
vera
different
from
the
possession
of
your
estate
and
moreover
as
he
could
gain
little
by
the
capture
of
your
body
wherefore
should
it
not
be
your
soul
that
he
is
in
pursuit
of
my
soul
you
rascal
said
the
young
lord
what
good
should
my
soul
do
him
what
do
i
ken
about
that
said
moniplies
they
go
about
roaring
and
seeking
whom
they
may
devour
doubtless
they
like
the
food
that
they
rage
so
much
about
and
my
lord
they
say
added
moniplies
drawing
up
still
closer
to
his
master
side
they
say
that
master
heriot
has
one
spirit
in
his
house
how
or
what
do
you
mean
said
nigel
i
will
break
your
head
you
drunken
knave
if
you
palter
with
me
any
drunken
answered
his
trusty
adherent
and
is
this
the
story
why
how
could
i
but
drink
your
lordship
health
on
my
bare
knees
when
master
jenkin
began
it
to
me
hang
them
that
would
not
i
would
have
cut
the
impudent
knave
hams
with
my
broadsword
that
should
make
scruple
of
it
and
so
have
made
him
kneel
when
he
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
rise
again
but
touching
the
spirit
he
proceeded
finding
that
his
master
made
no
answer
to
his
valorous
tirade
your
lordship
has
seen
her
with
your
own
i
saw
no
spirit
said
glenvarloch
but
yet
breathing
thick
as
one
who
expects
some
singular
disclosure
what
mean
you
by
a
spirit
you
saw
a
young
lady
come
in
to
prayers
that
spoke
not
a
word
to
any
one
only
made
becks
and
bows
to
the
old
gentleman
and
lady
of
the
house
ken
ye
wha
she
is
no
indeed
answered
nigel
some
relation
of
the
family
i
deil
a
bit
deil
a
bit
answered
moniplies
hastily
not
a
kin
to
them
if
she
had
a
drop
of
blood
in
her
body
i
tell
you
but
what
all
human
beings
allege
to
be
truth
that
swell
within
hue
and
cry
of
lombard
street
that
lady
or
quean
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
her
has
been
dead
in
the
body
these
many
a
year
though
she
haunts
them
as
we
have
seen
even
at
their
very
you
will
allow
her
to
be
a
good
spirit
at
least
said
nigel
olifaunt
since
she
chooses
such
a
time
to
visit
her
friends
for
that
i
kenna
my
lord
answered
the
superstitious
follower
i
ken
no
spirit
that
would
have
faced
the
right
down
of
mess
john
knox
whom
my
father
stood
by
in
his
very
warst
days
bating
a
chance
time
when
the
court
which
my
father
supplied
with
was
against
him
but
yon
divine
has
another
airt
from
powerful
master
rollock
and
mess
david
black
of
north
leith
and
sic
wha
can
ken
if
it
please
your
lordship
whether
sic
prayers
as
the
southron
read
out
of
their
auld
blethering
black
there
may
not
be
as
powerful
to
invite
fiends
as
a
right
prayer
warm
fraw
the
heart
may
be
powerful
to
drive
them
away
even
as
the
evil
spirit
was
driven
by
he
smell
of
the
fish
liver
from
the
of
sara
the
daughter
of
raguel
as
to
whilk
story
nevertheless
i
make
scruple
to
say
whether
it
be
truth
or
not
better
men
than
i
am
having
doubted
on
that
well
well
well
said
his
master
impatiently
we
are
now
near
home
and
i
have
permitted
you
to
speak
of
this
matter
for
once
that
we
may
have
an
end
to
your
prying
folly
and
your
idiotical
superstitions
for
ever
for
whom
do
you
or
your
absurd
authors
or
informers
take
this
lady
i
can
sae
naething
preceesely
as
to
that
answered
moniplies
certain
it
is
her
body
died
and
was
laid
in
the
grave
many
a
day
since
notwithstanding
she
still
wanders
on
earth
and
chiefly
amongst
maister
heriot
family
though
she
hath
been
seen
in
other
places
by
them
that
well
knew
her
but
who
she
is
i
will
not
warrant
to
say
or
how
she
becomes
attached
like
a
highland
brownie
to
some
peculiar
family
they
say
she
has
a
row
of
apartments
of
her
own
parlour
and
bedroom
but
deil
a
bed
she
sleeps
in
but
her
own
coffin
and
the
walls
doors
and
windows
are
so
chinked
up
as
to
prevent
the
least
blink
of
daylight
from
entering
and
then
she
dwells
by
torchlight
to
what
purpose
if
she
be
a
spirit
said
nigel
olifaunt
how
can
i
tell
your
lordship
answered
his
attendant
i
thank
god
i
know
nothing
of
her
likings
or
mislikings
only
her
coffin
is
there
and
i
leave
your
lordship
to
guess
what
a
live
person
has
to
do
with
a
coffin
as
little
as
a
ghost
with
a
lantern
i
what
reason
repeated
nigel
can
a
creature
so
young
and
so
beautiful
have
already
habitually
to
contemplate
her
bed
of
rest
in
troth
i
kenna
my
lord
answered
moniplies
but
there
is
the
coffin
as
they
told
me
who
have
seen
it
it
is
made
of
with
silver
nails
and
lined
all
through
with
damask
might
serve
a
princess
to
rest
singular
said
nigel
whose
brain
like
that
of
most
active
young
spirits
was
easily
caught
by
the
singular
and
the
romantic
does
she
not
eat
with
the
family
who
she
exclaimed
moniplies
as
if
surprised
at
the
question
they
would
need
a
lang
spoon
would
sup
with
her
i
trow
always
there
is
something
put
for
her
into
the
tower
as
they
call
it
whilk
is
a
whigmaleery
of
a
that
turns
round
half
on
the
tae
side
the
wa
half
on
the
i
have
seen
the
contrivance
in
foreign
nunneries
said
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
and
is
it
thus
she
receives
her
food
they
tell
me
something
is
put
in
ilka
day
for
fashion
sake
replied
the
attendant
but
it
no
to
be
supposed
she
would
consume
it
ony
mair
than
the
images
of
bel
and
the
dragon
consumed
the
dainty
vivers
that
were
placed
before
them
there
are
stout
yeomen
and
in
the
house
enow
to
play
the
part
of
as
well
as
the
threescore
and
ten
priests
of
bel
besides
their
wives
and
and
she
is
never
seen
in
the
family
but
when
the
hour
of
prayer
arrives
said
the
master
never
that
i
hear
of
replied
the
servant
it
is
singular
said
nigel
olifaunt
musing
were
it
not
for
the
ornaments
which
she
wears
and
still
more
for
her
attendance
upon
the
service
of
the
protestant
church
i
should
know
what
to
think
and
should
believe
her
either
a
catholic
votaress
who
for
some
cogent
reason
was
allowed
to
make
her
cell
here
in
london
or
some
unhappy
popish
devotee
who
was
in
the
course
of
undergoing
a
dreadful
penance
as
it
is
i
know
not
what
to
deem
of
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
linkboy
knocking
at
the
door
of
honest
john
christie
whose
wife
came
forth
with
quips
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
to
welcome
her
honoured
guest
on
his
return
to
his
apartment
chapter
viii
ay
mark
the
matron
well
and
laugh
not
harry
at
her
old
and
velvet
guard
i
call
her
like
the
ear
of
dionysius
i
mean
that

built
his
dungeon
to
catch
the
groans
and
discontented
murmurs
of

all
that
passes
or
is
supposed
to
pass
in
this
wide

she
can

it
too
if
that
her

shall
call
on
her
to
do
so
and
retail
it
for
your
advantage
so
that
you

make

with

the
conspiracy
we
must
now
introduce
to
the
reader
acquaintance
another
character
busy
and
important
far
beyond
her
ostensible
situation
in
society
in
a
word
dame
ursula
suddlechop
wife
of
benjamin
suddlechop
the
most
renowned
barber
in
all
fleet
street
this
dame
had
her
own
particular
merits
the
principal
part
of
which
was
if
her
own
report
could
be
trusted
an
infinite
desire
to
be
of
service
to
her
leaving
to
her
thin
partner
the
boast
of
having
the
most
dexterous
snap
with
his
fingers
of
any
shaver
in
london
and
the
care
of
a
shop
where
starved
apprentices
flayed
the
faces
of
those
who
were
boobies
enough
to
trust
them
the
dame
drove
a
separate
and
more
lucrative
trade
which
yet
had
so
many
odd
turns
and
windings
that
it
seemed
in
many
respects
to
contradict
itself
its
highest
and
most
important
duties
were
of
a
very
secret
and
confidential
nature
and
dame
ursula
suddlechop
was
never
known
to
betray
any
transaction
intrusted
to
her
unless
she
had
either
been
indifferently
paid
for
her
service
or
that
some
one
found
it
convenient
to
give
her
a
double
douceur
to
make
her
disgorge
the
secret
and
these
contingencies
happened
in
so
few
cases
that
her
character
for
trustiness
remained
as
unimpeached
as
that
for
honesty
and
benevolence
in
fact
she
was
a
most
admirable
matron
and
could
be
useful
to
the
impassioned
and
the
frail
in
the
rise
progress
and
consequences
of
their
passion
she
could
contrive
an
interview
for
lovers
who
could
show
proper
reasons
for
meeting
privately
she
could
relieve
the
frail
fair
one
of
the
burden
of
a
guilty
passion
and
perhaps
establish
the
hopeful
offspring
of
unlicensed
love
as
the
heir
of
some
family
whose
love
was
lawful
but
where
an
heir
had
not
followed
the
union
more
than
this
she
could
do
and
had
been
concerned
in
deeper
and
dearer
secrets
she
had
been
a
pupil
of
turner
and
learned
from
her
the
secret
of
making
the
yellow
starch
and
it
may
be
two
or
three
other
secrets
of
more
consequence
though
perhaps
none
that
went
to
the
criminal
extent
of
those
whereof
her
mistress
was
accused
but
all
that
was
deep
and
dark
in
her
real
character
was
covered
by
the
show
of
outward
mirth
and
the
hearty
laugh
and
buxom
jest
with
which
the
dame
knew
well
how
to
conciliate
the
elder
part
of
her
neighbours
and
the
many
petty
arts
by
which
she
could
recommend
herself
to
the
younger
those
especially
of
her
own
sex
dame
ursula
was
in
appearance
scarce
past
forty
and
her
full
but
not
overgrown
form
and
still
comely
features
although
her
person
was
plumped
out
and
her
face
somewhat
coloured
by
good
cheer
had
a
joyous
expression
of
gaiety
and
which
set
off
the
remains
of
beauty
in
the
wane
marriages
births
and
christenings
were
seldom
thought
to
be
performed
with
sufficient
ceremony
for
a
considerable
distance
round
her
abode
unless
dame
ursley
as
they
called
her
was
present
she
could
contrive
all
sorts
of
pastimes
games
and
jests
which
might
amuse
the
large
companies
which
the
hospitality
of
our
ancestors
assembled
together
on
such
occasions
so
that
her
presence
was
literally
considered
as
indispensable
in
the
families
of
all
citizens
of
ordinary
rank
at
such
joyous
periods
so
much
also
was
she
supposed
to
know
of
life
and
its
labyrinths
that
she
was
the
willing
confidant
of
half
the
loving
couples
in
the
vicinity
most
of
whom
used
to
communicate
their
secrets
to
and
receive
their
counsel
from
dame
ursley
the
rich
rewarded
her
services
with
rings
owches
or
gold
pieces
which
she
liked
still
better
and
she
very
generously
gave
her
assistance
to
the
poor
on
the
same
mixed
principles
as
young
practitioners
in
medicine
assist
them
partly
from
compassion
and
partly
to
keep
her
hand
in
use
dame
ursley
reputation
in
the
city
was
the
greater
that
her
practice
had
extended
beyond
temple
bar
and
that
she
had
acquaintances
nay
patrons
and
patronesses
among
the
quality
whose
rank
as
their
members
were
much
fewer
and
the
prospect
of
approaching
the
courtly
sphere
much
more
difficult
bore
a
degree
of
consequence
unknown
to
the
present
day
when
the
toe
of
the
citizen
presses
so
close
on
the
courtier
heel
dame
ursley
maintained
her
intercourse
with
this
superior
rank
of
customers
partly
by
driving
a
small
trade
in
perfumes
essences
pomades
from
france
dishes
or
ornaments
from
china
then
already
beginning
to
be
fashionable
not
to
mention
drugs
of
various
descriptions
chiefly
for
the
use
of
the
ladies
and
partly
by
other
services
more
or
less
connected
with
the
esoteric
branches
of
her
profession
heretofore
alluded
to
possessing
such
and
so
many
various
modes
of
thriving
dame
ursley
was
nevertheless
so
poor
that
she
might
probably
have
mended
her
own
circumstances
as
well
as
her
husband
if
she
had
renounced
them
all
and
set
herself
quietly
down
to
the
care
of
her
own
household
and
to
assist
benjamin
in
the
concerns
of
his
trade
but
ursula
was
luxurious
and
genial
in
her
habits
and
could
no
more
have
endured
the
stinted
economy
of
benjamin
board
than
she
could
have
reconciled
herself
to
the
bald
chat
of
his
conversation
it
was
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
lord
nigel
olifaunt
dined
with
the
wealthy
goldsmith
that
we
must
introduce
ursula
suddlechop
upon
the
stage
she
had
that
morning
made
a
long
tour
to
westminster
was
fatigued
and
had
assumed
a
certain
large
rendered
smooth
by
frequent
use
placed
on
one
side
of
her
chimney
in
which
there
was
lit
a
small
but
bright
fire
here
she
observed
betwixt
sleeping
and
waking
the
simmering
of
a
pot
of
ale
on
the
brown
surface
of
which
bobbed
a
small
sufficiently
roasted
while
a
little
mulatto
girl
watched
still
more
attentively
the
process
of
dressing
a
veal
sweetbread
in
a
silver
stewpan
which
occupied
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
with
these
viands
doubtless
dame
ursula
proposed
concluding
the
well
spent
day
of
which
she
reckoned
the
labour
over
and
the
rest
at
her
own
command
she
was
deceived
however
for
just
as
the
ale
or
to
speak
technically
the
was
fitted
for
drinking
and
the
little
dingy
maiden
intimated
that
the
sweetbread
was
ready
to
be
eaten
the
thin
cracked
voice
of
benjamin
was
heard
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
why
dame
ursley
why
wife
i
say
why
dame
why
love
you
are
wanted
more
than
a
strop
for
a
blunt
razor
why
dame
i
would
some
one
would
draw
a
razor
across
thy
windpipe
thou
bawling
ass
said
the
dame
to
herself
in
the
first
moment
of
irritation
against
her
clamorous
helpmate
and
then
called
aloud
why
what
is
the
matter
master
suddlechop
i
am
just
going
to
slip
into
bed
i
have
been
daggled
to
and
fro
the
whole
nay
sweetheart
it
is
not
me
said
the
patient
benjamin
but
the
scots
from
neighbour
ramsay
who
must
speak
with
you
at
the
word
sweetheart
dame
ursley
cast
a
wistful
look
at
the
mess
which
was
stewed
to
a
second
in
the
stewpan
and
then
replied
with
a
sigh
bid
scots
jenny
come
up
master
suddlechop
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
hear
what
she
has
to
say
then
added
in
a
lower
tone
and
i
hope
she
will
go
to
the
devil
in
the
flame
of
a
like
many
a
scots
witch
before
her
the
scots
laundress
entered
accordingly
and
having
heard
nothing
of
the
last
kind
wish
of
dame
suddlechop
made
her
reverence
with
considerable
respect
and
said
her
young
mistress
had
returned
home
unwell
and
wished
to
see
her
neighbour
dame
ursley
directly
and
why
will
it
not
do
jenny
my
good
woman
said
dame
ursley
for
i
have
been
as
far
as
whitehall
already
and
i
am
worn
off
my
feet
my
good
aweel
answered
jenny
with
great
composure
and
if
that
sae
be
sae
i
maun
take
the
langer
tramp
mysell
and
maun
gae
down
the
waterside
for
auld
mother
redcap
at
the
hungerford
stairs
that
deals
in
comforting
young
creatures
as
you
do
yoursell
hinny
for
ane
o
ye
the
bairn
maun
see
before
she
sleeps
and
that
a
that
i
ken
so
saying
the
old
emissary
without
farther
entreaty
turned
on
her
heel
and
was
about
to
retreat
when
dame
ursley
exclaimed
no
no
if
the
sweet
child
your
mistress
has
any
necessary
occasion
for
good
advice
and
kind
tendance
you
need
not
go
to
mother
redcap
janet
she
may
do
very
well
for
skippers
wives
chandlers
daughters
and
such
like
but
nobody
shall
wait
on
pretty
mistress
margaret
the
daughter
of
his
most
sacred
majesty
horologer
excepting
and
saving
myself
and
so
i
will
but
take
my
chopins
and
my
cloak
and
put
on
my
muffler
and
cross
the
street
to
neighbour
ramsay
in
an
instant
but
tell
me
yourself
good
jenny
are
you
not
something
tired
of
your
young
frolics
and
change
of
mind
twenty
times
in
troth
not
i
said
the
patient
drudge
unless
it
may
be
when
she
is
a
wee
fashious
about
washing
her
laces
but
i
have
been
her
keeper
since
she
was
a
bairn
neighbour
suddlechop
and
that
makes
a
ay
said
dame
ursley
still
busied
putting
on
additional
defences
against
the
night
air
and
you
know
for
certain
that
she
has
two
hundred
pounds
in
good
land
at
her
own
free
disposal
left
by
her
grandmother
heaven
rest
her
soul
said
the
scotswoman
and
to
a
daintier
lassie
she
could
not
have
bequeathed
very
true
very
true
mistress
for
with
all
her
little
whims
i
have
always
said
mistress
margaret
ramsay
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
ward
and
jenny
i
warrant
the
poor
child
has
had
no
supper
jenny
could
not
say
but
it
was
the
case
for
her
master
being
out
the
twa
lads
had
gone
out
after
shutting
shop
to
fetch
them
home
and
she
and
the
other
maid
had
gone
out
to
sandy
macgivan
to
see
a
friend
frae
scotland
as
was
very
natural
janet
said
dame
ursley
who
found
her
interest
in
assenting
to
all
sorts
of
propositions
from
all
sorts
of
persons
and
so
the
fire
went
out
too
said
jenny
which
was
the
most
natural
of
the
whole
said
dame
suddlechop
and
so
to
cut
the
matter
short
jenny
i
carry
over
the
little
bit
of
supper
that
i
was
going
to
eat
for
dinner
i
have
tasted
none
and
it
may
be
my
young
pretty
mistress
marget
will
eat
a
morsel
with
me
for
it
is
mere
emptiness
mistress
jenny
that
often
puts
these
fancies
of
illness
into
young
folk
so
saying
she
put
the
silver
with
the
ale
into
jenny
hands
and
assuming
her
mantle
with
the
alacrity
of
one
determined
to
sacrifice
inclination
to
duty
she
hid
the
stewpan
under
its
folds
and
commanded
wilsa
the
little
mulatto
girl
to
light
them
across
the
street
whither
away
so
late
said
the
barber
whom
they
passed
seated
with
his
starveling
boys
round
a
mess
of
stockfish
and
parsnips
in
the
shop
below
if
i
were
to
tell
you
gaffer
said
the
dame
with
most
contemptuous
coolness
i
do
not
think
you
could
do
my
errand
so
i
will
keep
it
to
benjamin
was
too
much
accustomed
to
his
wife
independent
mode
of
conduct
to
pursue
his
inquiry
farther
nor
did
the
dame
tarry
for
farther
question
but
marched
out
at
the
door
telling
the
eldest
of
the
boys
to
sit
up
till
her
return
and
look
to
the
house
the
the
night
was
dark
and
rainy
and
although
the
distance
betwixt
the
two
shops
was
short
it
allowed
dame
ursley
leisure
enough
while
she
strode
along
with
petticoats
to
embitter
it
by
the
following
grumbling
reflections
i
wonder
what
i
have
done
that
i
must
needs
trudge
at
every
old
beldam
bidding
and
every
young
minx
maggot
i
have
been
marched
from
temple
bar
to
whitechapel
on
the
matter
of
a
pinmaker
wife
having
pricked
her
fingers
marry
her
husband
that
made
the
weapon
might
have
salved
the
and
here
is
this
fantastic
ape
pretty
mistress
marget
forsooth
such
a
beauty
as
i
could
make
of
a
dutch
doll
and
as
fantastic
and
humorous
and
conceited
as
if
she
were
a
duchess
i
have
seen
her
in
the
same
day
as
changeful
as
a
marmozet
and
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
i
should
like
to
know
whether
her
little
conceited
noddle
or
her
father
old
crazy
calculating
breeds
most
whimsies
but
then
there
that
two
hundred
pounds
in
dirty
land
and
the
father
is
held
a
close
chuff
though
a
fanciful
he
is
our
landlord
besides
and
she
has
begged
a
late
day
from
him
for
our
rent
so
god
help
me
i
must
be
comfortable
besides
the
little
capricious
devil
is
my
only
key
to
get
at
master
george
heriot
secret
and
it
concerns
my
character
to
find
that
out
and
so
andiamos
as
the
lingua
franca
hath
thus
pondering
she
moved
forward
with
hasty
strides
until
she
arrived
at
the
watchmaker
habitation
the
attendant
admitted
them
by
means
of
a
onward
glided
dame
ursula
now
in
glimmer
and
now
in
gloom
not
like
the
lovely
lady
cristabelle
through
gothic
sculpture
and
ancient
armour
but
creeping
and
stumbling
amongst
relics
of
old
machines
and
models
of
new
inventions
in
various
branches
of
mechanics
with
which
wrecks
of
useless
ingenuity
either
in
a
broken
or
shape
the
apartment
of
the
fanciful
though
ingenious
mechanist
was
continually
lumbered
at
length
they
attained
by
a
very
narrow
staircase
pretty
mistress
margaret
apartment
where
she
the
cynosure
of
the
eyes
of
every
bold
young
bachelor
in
fleet
street
sat
in
a
posture
which
hovered
between
the
discontented
and
the
disconsolate
for
her
pretty
back
and
shoulders
were
rounded
into
a
curve
her
round
and
dimpled
chin
reposed
in
the
hollow
of
her
little
palm
while
the
fingers
were
folded
over
her
mouth
her
elbow
rested
on
a
table
and
her
eyes
seemed
fixed
upon
the
dying
charcoal
which
was
expiring
in
a
small
grate
she
scarce
turned
her
head
when
dame
ursula
entered
and
when
the
presence
of
that
estimable
matron
was
more
precisely
announced
in
words
by
the
old
scotswoman
mistress
margaret
without
changing
her
posture
muttered
some
sort
of
answer
that
was
wholly
unintelligible
go
your
ways
down
to
the
kitchen
with
wilsa
good
mistress
jenny
said
dame
ursula
who
was
used
to
all
sorts
of
freaks
on
the
part
of
her
patients
or
clients
whichever
they
might
be
termed
put
the
stewpan
and
the
porringer
by
the
fireside
and
go
down
below
i
must
speak
to
my
pretty
love
mistress
margaret
by
myself
and
there
is
not
a
bachelor
betwixt
this
and
bow
but
will
envy
me
the
the
attendants
retired
as
directed
and
dame
ursula
having
availed
herself
of
the
embers
of
charcoal
to
place
her
stewpan
to
the
best
advantage
drew
herself
as
close
as
she
could
to
her
patient
and
began
in
a
low
soothing
and
confidential
tone
of
voice
to
inquire
what
ailed
her
pretty
flower
of
neighbours
nothing
dame
said
margaret
somewhat
pettishly
and
changing
her
posture
so
as
rather
to
turn
her
back
upon
the
kind
inquirer
nothing
answered
dame
suddlechop
and
do
you
use
to
send
for
your
friends
out
of
bed
at
this
hour
for
nothing
it
was
not
i
who
sent
for
you
dame
replied
the
malecontent
maiden
and
who
was
it
then
said
ursula
for
if
i
had
not
been
sent
for
i
had
not
been
here
at
this
time
of
night
i
promise
you
it
was
the
old
scotch
fool
jenny
who
did
it
out
of
her
own
head
i
suppose
said
margaret
for
she
has
been
stunning
me
these
two
hours
about
you
and
mother
me
and
mother
redcap
said
dame
ursula
an
old
fool
indeed
that
couples
folk
up
but
come
come
my
sweet
little
neighbour
jenny
is
no
such
fool
after
all
she
knows
young
folks
want
more
and
better
advice
than
her
own
and
she
knows
too
where
to
find
it
for
them
so
you
must
take
heart
of
grace
my
pretty
maiden
and
tell
me
what
you
are
moping
about
and
then
let
dame
ursula
alone
for
finding
out
a
nay
an
ye
be
so
wise
mother
ursula
replied
the
girl
you
may
guess
what
i
ail
without
my
telling
ay
ay
child
answered
the
complaisant
matron
no
one
can
play
better
than
i
at
the
good
old
game
of
what
is
my
thought
like
now
warrant
that
little
head
of
yours
is
running
on
a
new
a
foot
higher
than
those
our
city
dames
wear
or
you
are
all
for
a
trip
to
islington
or
ware
and
your
father
is
cross
and
will
not
consent
or
or
you
are
an
old
fool
dame
suddlechop
said
margaret
peevishly
and
must
needs
trouble
yourself
about
matters
you
know
nothing
fool
as
much
as
you
will
mistress
said
dame
ursula
offended
in
her
turn
but
not
so
very
many
years
older
than
yourself
oh
we
are
angry
are
we
said
the
beauty
and
pray
madam
ursula
how
come
you
that
are
not
so
many
years
older
than
me
to
talk
about
such
nonsense
to
me
who
am
so
many
years
younger
and
who
yet
have
too
much
sense
to
care
about
and
islington
well
well
young
mistress
said
the
sage
counsellor
rising
i
perceive
i
can
be
of
no
use
here
and
methinks
since
you
know
your
own
matters
so
much
better
than
other
people
do
you
might
dispense
with
disturbing
folks
at
midnight
to
ask
their
why
now
you
are
angry
mother
said
margaret
detaining
her
this
comes
of
your
coming
out
at
eventide
without
eating
your
supper
i
never
heard
you
utter
a
cross
word
after
you
had
finished
your
little
here
janet
a
trencher
and
salt
for
dame
ursula
and
what
have
you
in
that
porringer
dame
filthy
clammy
ale
as
i
would
live
let
janet
fling
it
out
of
the
window
or
keep
it
for
my
morning
draught
and
she
shall
bring
you
the
pottle
of
sack
that
was
set
ready
for
him
good
man
he
will
never
find
out
the
difference
for
ale
will
wash
down
his
dusty
calculations
quite
as
well
as
truly
sweetheart
i
am
of
your
opinion
said
dame
ursula
whose
temporary
displeasure
vanished
at
once
before
these
preparations
for
good
cheer
and
so
settling
herself
on
the
great
with
a
table
before
her
she
began
to
dispatch
with
good
appetite
the
little
delicate
dish
which
she
had
prepared
for
herself
she
did
not
however
fail
in
the
duties
of
civility
and
earnestly
but
in
vain
pressed
mistress
margaret
to
partake
her
dainties
the
damsel
declined
the
invitation
at
least
pledge
me
in
a
glass
of
sack
said
dame
ursula
i
have
heard
my
grandame
say
that
before
the
gospellers
came
in
the
old
catholic
father
confessors
and
their
penitents
always
had
a
cup
of
sack
together
before
confession
and
you
are
my
i
shall
drink
no
sack
i
am
sure
said
margaret
and
i
told
you
before
that
if
you
can
not
find
out
what
ails
me
i
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
tell
so
saying
she
turned
away
from
dame
ursula
once
more
and
resumed
her
musing
posture
with
her
hand
on
her
elbow
and
her
back
at
least
one
shoulder
turned
towards
her
confidant
nay
then
said
dame
ursula
i
must
exert
my
skill
in
good
you
must
give
me
this
pretty
hand
and
i
will
tell
you
by
palmistry
as
well
as
any
gipsy
of
them
all
what
foot
it
is
you
halt
as
if
i
halted
on
any
foot
at
all
said
margaret
something
scornfully
but
yielding
her
left
hand
to
ursula
and
continuing
at
the
same
time
her
averted
position
i
see
brave
lines
here
said
ursula
and
not
ill
to
read
neither
pleasure
and
wealth
and
merry
nights
and
late
mornings
to
my
beauty
and
such
an
equipage
as
shall
shake
whitehall
o
have
i
touched
you
there
and
smile
you
now
my
pretty
one
for
why
should
not
he
be
lord
mayor
and
go
to
court
in
his
gilded
caroch
as
others
have
done
before
him
lord
mayor
pshaw
replied
margaret
and
why
pshaw
at
my
lord
mayor
sweetheart
or
perhaps
you
pshaw
at
my
prophecy
but
there
is
a
cross
in
every
one
line
of
life
as
well
as
in
yours
darling
and
what
though
i
see
a
flat
cap
in
this
pretty
palm
yet
there
is
a
sparking
black
eye
under
it
hath
not
its
match
in
the
ward
of
whom
do
you
mean
dame
said
margaret
coldly
whom
should
i
mean
said
dame
ursula
but
the
prince
of
and
king
of
good
company
jenkin
vincent
out
woman
jenkin
vincent
a
clown
a
cockney
exclaimed
the
indignant
damsel
ay
sets
the
wind
in
that
quarter
beauty
quoth
the
dame
why
it
has
changed
something
since
we
spoke
together
last
for
then
i
would
have
sworn
it
blew
fairer
for
poor
jin
vin
and
the
poor
lad
dotes
on
you
too
and
would
rather
see
your
eyes
than
the
first
glimpse
of
the
sun
on
the
great
holiday
on
i
would
my
eyes
had
the
power
of
the
sun
to
blind
his
then
said
margaret
to
teach
the
drudge
his
nay
said
dame
ursula
there
be
some
who
say
that
frank
tunstall
is
as
proper
a
lad
as
jin
vin
and
of
surety
he
is
third
cousin
to
a
knighthood
and
come
of
a
good
house
and
so
mayhap
you
may
be
for
northward
ho
maybe
i
may
answered
margaret
but
not
with
my
father
i
thank
you
dame
nay
then
the
devil
may
guess
your
thoughts
for
me
said
dame
ursula
this
comes
of
trying
to
shoe
a
filly
that
is
eternally
wincing
and
shifting
ground
hear
me
then
said
margaret
and
mind
what
i
this
day
i
dined
abroad
i
can
tell
you
where
answered
her
counsellor
with
your
godfather
the
rich
goldsmith
ay
you
see
i
know
something
nay
i
could
tell
you
as
i
would
with
whom
indeed
said
margaret
turning
suddenly
round
with
an
accent
of
strong
surprise
and
colouring
up
to
the
eyes
with
old
sir
mungo
malagrowther
said
the
oracular
dame
he
was
trimmed
in
my
benjamin
shop
in
his
way
to
the
pshaw
the
frightful
old
mouldy
skeleton
said
the
damsel
indeed
you
say
true
my
dear
replied
the
confidant
it
is
a
shame
to
him
to
be
out
of
saint
pancras
for
i
know
no
other
place
he
is
fit
for
the
old
railer
he
said
to
my
husband
somewhat
which
signifies
nothing
to
our
purpose
i
dare
say
interrupted
margaret
i
must
speak
there
dined
with
us
a
nobleman
a
nobleman
the
maiden
mad
said
dame
ursula
there
dined
with
us
i
say
continued
margaret
without
regarding
the
interruption
a
nobleman
a
scottish
now
our
lady
keep
her
said
the
confidant
she
is
quite
frantic
heard
ever
any
one
of
a
watchmaker
daughter
falling
in
love
with
a
nobleman
and
a
scots
nobleman
to
make
the
matter
complete
who
are
all
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
as
poor
as
job
a
scots
nobleman
quotha
i
had
lief
you
told
me
of
a
jew
pedlar
i
would
have
you
think
how
all
this
is
to
end
pretty
one
before
you
jump
in
the
that
is
nothing
to
you
ursula
it
is
your
assistance
said
mistress
margaret
and
not
your
advice
that
i
am
desirous
to
have
and
you
know
i
can
make
it
worth
your
o
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
lucre
mistress
margaret
answered
the
obliging
dame
but
truly
i
would
have
you
listen
to
some
advice
bethink
you
of
your
own
my
father
calling
is
mechanical
said
margaret
but
our
blood
is
not
so
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
we
are
descended
at
a
distance
indeed
from
the
great
earls
of
footnote
the
head
of
the
ancient
and
distinguished
house
of
ramsay
and
to
whom
as
their
chief
the
individuals
of
that
name
look
as
their
origin
and
source
of
gentry
allan
ramsay
the
pastoral
poet
in
the
same
manner
makes
dalhousie
of
an
auld
descent
my
chief
my
stoup
my
ay
ay
said
dame
ursula
even
so
i
never
knew
a
scot
of
you
but
was
descended
as
ye
call
it
from
some
great
house
or
other
and
a
piteous
descent
it
often
is
and
as
for
the
distance
you
speak
of
it
is
so
great
as
to
put
you
out
of
sight
of
each
other
yet
do
not
toss
your
pretty
head
so
scornfully
but
tell
me
the
name
of
this
lordly
northern
gallant
and
we
will
try
what
can
be
done
in
the
it
is
lord
glenvarloch
whom
they
call
lord
nigel
olifaunt
said
margaret
in
a
low
voice
and
turning
away
to
hide
her
blushes
marry
heaven
forefend
exclaimed
dame
suddlechop
this
is
the
very
devil
and
something
worse
how
mean
you
said
the
damsel
surprised
at
the
vivacity
of
her
exclamation
why
know
ye
not
said
the
dame
what
powerful
enemies
he
has
at
court
know
ye
not
but
blisters
on
my
tongue
it
runs
too
fast
for
my
wit
enough
to
say
that
you
had
better
make
your
under
a
falling
house
than
think
of
young
he
is
unfortunate
then
said
margaret
i
knew
it
i
divined
it
there
was
sorrow
in
his
voice
when
he
said
even
what
was
gay
there
was
a
touch
of
misfortune
in
his
melancholy
smile
he
had
not
thus
clung
to
my
thoughts
had
i
seen
him
in
all
the
glare
of
romances
have
cracked
her
brain
said
dame
ursula
she
is
a
castaway
girl
utterly
distraught
loves
a
scots
lord
and
likes
him
the
better
for
being
unfortunate
well
mistress
i
am
sorry
this
is
a
matter
i
can
not
aid
you
in
it
goes
against
my
conscience
and
it
is
an
affair
above
my
condition
and
beyond
my
management
but
i
will
keep
your
you
will
not
be
so
base
as
to
desert
me
after
having
drawn
my
secret
from
me
said
margaret
indignantly
if
you
do
i
know
how
to
have
my
revenge
and
if
you
do
not
i
will
reward
you
well
remember
the
house
your
husband
dwells
in

my
father

remember
it
but
too
well
mistress
margaret
said
ursula
after
a
moment
reflection
and
i
would
serve
you
in
any
thing

my
condition
but
to
meddle
with
such
high
matters
i
shall
never
forget
poor
mistress
turner
my
honoured
patroness
peace
be
with
her
she
had
the
to
meddle
in
the
matter
of
somerset
and
overbury
and
so
the
great
earl
and
his
lady
slipt
their
necks
out
of
the
collar
and
left
her
and
some
others
to
suffer
in
their
stead
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
of
her
standing
on
the
scaffold
with
the
ruff
round
her
pretty
neck
all
done
up
with
the
yellow
starch
which
i
had
so
often
helped
her
to
make
and
that
was
so
soon
to
give
place
to
a
rough
hempen
cord
such
a
sight
sweetheart
will
make
one
loath
to
meddle
with
matters
that
are
too
hot
or
heavy
for
their
out
you
fool
answered
mistress
margaret

i
one
to
speak
to
you
about
such
criminal
practices

to
get

precise
knowledge
of
what
affair

this
young
nobleman
to

when
you
have
his
secret
said
ursula
what
will
it
avail
you
sweetheart
and
yet
i
would
do
your
errand
if
you
could
do
as
much
for
and
what
is
it
you
would
have
of
me
said
mistress
margaret
what
you
have
been
angry
with
me
for
asking
before

have
some
light
about
the
story
of
your
ghost
that
is
only
seen
at
not
for
the
world
said
mistress
margaret
will
i
be
a
spy
on
my
kind
godfather
secrets
no
ursula
that
i
will
never
pry
into
which
he
desires
to
keep
hidden
but
thou
knowest
that
i
have
a
fortune
of
my
own
which
must
at
no
distant
day
come
under
my
own
management
think
of
some
other
ay
that
i
well
know
said
the
counsellor

is
that
two
hundred
per
year
with
your
father
indulgence
that
makes
you
so
wilful
it
may
be
so
said
margaret
ramsay
meanwhile
do
you
serve
me
truly
and
here
is
a
ring
of
value
in
pledge
that
when
my
fortune
is
in
my
own
hand
i
will
redeem
the
token
with
fifty
broad
pieces
of
fifty
broad
pieces
of
gold

the
dame
and
this
ring
which
is
a
right
fair
one
in
token

not
of
your
word
well
sweetheart
if
i
must
put
my
throat
in
peril
i
am
sure
i
can
not
risk
it
for
a
friend
more
generous
than
you
and
i
would
not
think
of
more
than
the
pleasure
of
serving
you
only
benjamin
gets
more
idle
every
day
and
our
family
say
no
more
of
it
said
margaret
we
understand
each
other
and
now
tell
me
what
you
know
of
this
young
man
affairs
which
made
you
so
unwilling
to
meddle
with
them
of
that
i
can
say
no
great
matter
as
yet
answered
dame
ursula
only
i
know
the
most
powerful
among
his
own
countrymen
are
against
him
and
also
the
most
powerful
at
the
court
here
but
i
will
learn
more
of
it
for
it
will
be
a
dim
print
that
i
will
not
read
for
your
sake
pretty
mistress
margaret
know
you
where
this
gallant
dwells
i
heard
by
accident
said
margaret
as
if
ashamed
of
the
minute
particularity
of
her
memory
upon
such
an
occasion
he
lodges
i
think
at
one
christie
if
i
mistake
not
at
paul
wharf
a
a
proper
lodging
for
a
young
baron
well
but
cheer
you
up
mistress
margaret
if
he
has
come
up
a
caterpillar
like
some
of
his
countrymen
he
may
cast
his
slough
like
them
and
come
out
a
so
i
drink
and
sweet
dreams
to
you
in
another
parting
cup
of
sack
and
you
shall
hear
tidings
of
me
within
hours
and
once
more
i
commend
you
to
your
pillow
my
pearl
of
pearls
and
marguerite
of
marguerites
so
saying
she
kissed
the
reluctant
cheek
of
her
young
friend
or
patroness
and
took
her
departure
with
the
light
and
stealthy
pace
of
one
accustomed
to
accommodate
her
footsteps
to
the
purposes
of
dispatch
and
secrecy
margaret
ramsay
looked
after
her
for
some
time
in
anxious
silence
i
did
ill
she
at
length
murmured
to
let
her
wring
this
out
of
me
but
she
is
artful
bold
and
serviceable
and
i
think
faithful
or
if
not
she
will
be
true
at
least
to
her
interest
and
that
i
can
command
i
would
i
had
not
spoken
however
i
have
begun
a
hopeless
work
for
what
has
he
said
to
me
to
warrant
my
meddling
in
his
fortunes
nothing
but
words
of
the
most
ordinary
import
mere
and
terms
of
course
yet
who
knows
she
said
and
then
broke
off
looking
at
the
glass
the
while
which
as
it
reflected
back
a
face
of
great
beauty
probably
suggested
to
her
mind
a
more
favourable
conclusion
of
the
sentence
than
she
cared
to
trust
her
tongue
withal

hubbard
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
george
heriot
had
prepared
to
escort
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
to
the
court
at
whitehall
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
the
young
man
whose
fortunes
were
likely
to
depend
on
this
cast
felt
himself
more
than
usually
anxious
he
rose
early
made
his
toilette
with
uncommon
care
and
being
enabled
by
the
generosity
of
his
more
plebeian
countryman
to
set
out
a
very
handsome
person
to
the
best
advantage
he
obtained
a
momentary
approbation
from
himself
as
he
glanced
at
the
mirror
and
a
loud
and
distinct
plaudit
from
his
landlady
who
declared
at
once
that
in
her
judgment
he
would
take
the
wind
out
of
the
sail
of
every
gallant
in
the
presence
so
much
had
she
been
able
to
enrich
her
discourse
with
the
metaphors
of
those
with
whom
her
husband
dealt
at
the
appointed
hour
the
barge
of
master
george
heriot
arrived
handsomely
manned
and
appointed
having
a
tilt
with
his
own
cipher
and
the
arms
of
his
company
painted
thereupon
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
received
the
friend
who
had
evinced
such
disinterested
attachment
with
the
kind
courtesy
which
well
became
him
master
heriot
then
made
him
acquainted
with
the
bounty
of
his
sovereign
which
he
paid
over
to
his
young
friend
declining
what
he
had
himself
formerly
advanced
to
him
nigel
felt
all
the
gratitude
which
the
citizen
disinterested
friendship
had
deserved
and
was
not
wanting
in
expressing
it
suitably
yet
as
the
young
and
nobleman
embarked
to
go
to
the
presence
of
his
prince
under
the
patronage
of
one
whose
best
or
most
distinguished
qualification
was
his
being
an
eminent
member
of
the
goldsmiths
incorporation
he
felt
a
little
surprised
if
not
abashed
at
his
own
situation
and
richie
moniplies
as
he
stepped
over
the
gangway
to
take
his
place
forward
in
the
boat
could
not
help
muttering
it
was
a
changed
day
betwixt
master
heriot
and
his
honest
father
in
the
kraemes
but
doubtless
there
was
a
difference
between
clinking
on
gold
and
silver
and
clattering
upon
on
they
glided
by
the
assistance
of
the
oars
of
four
stout
watermen
along
the
thames
which
then
served
for
the
principal
betwixt
london
and
westminster
for
few
ventured
on
horseback
through
the
narrow
and
crowded
streets
of
the
city
and
coaches
were
then
a
luxury
reserved
only
for
the
higher
nobility
and
to
which
no
citizen
whatever
was
his
wealth
presumed
to
aspire
the
beauty
of
the
banks
especially
on
the
northern
side
where
the
gardens
of
the
nobility
descended
from
their
hotels
in
many
places
down
to
the
water
edge
was
pointed
out
to
nigel
by
his
kind
conductor
and
was
pointed
out
in
vain
the
mind
of
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
was
filled
with
anticipations
not
the
most
pleasant
concerning
the
manner
in
which
he
was
likely
to
be
received
by
that
monarch
in
whose
behalf
his
family
had
been
nearly
reduced
to
ruin
and
he
was
with
the
usual
mental
anxiety
of
those
in
such
a
situation
framing
imaginary
questions
from
the
king
and
his
spirit
in
devising
answers
to
them
his
conductor
saw
the
labour
of
nigel
mind
and
avoided
increasing
it
by
farther
conversation
so
that
when
he
had
explained
to
him
briefly
the
ceremonies
observed
at
court
on
such
occasions
of
presentation
the
rest
of
their
voyage
was
performed
in
silence
they
landed
at
whitehall
stairs
and
entered
the
palace
after
announcing
their
names
the
guards
paying
to
lord
glenvarloch
the
respect
and
honours
due
to
his
rank
the
young
man
heart
beat
high
and
thick
within
him
as
he
came
into
the
royal
apartments
his
education
abroad
conducted
as
it
had
been
on
a
narrow
and
limited
scale
had
given
him
but
imperfect
ideas
of
the
grandeur
of
a
court
and
the
philosophical
reflections
which
taught
him
to
set
ceremonial
and
exterior
splendour
at
defiance
proved
like
other
maxims
of
mere
philosophy
ineffectual
at
the
moment
they
were
weighed
against
the
impression
naturally
made
on
the
mind
of
an
inexperienced
youth
by
the
unusual
magnificence
of
the
scene
the
splendid
apartments
through
which
they
passed
the
rich
apparel
of
the
grooms
guards
and
apartments
had
something
in
it
trifling
and
commonplace
as
it
might
appear
to
practised
courtiers
embarrassing
and
even
alarming
to
one
who
went
through
these
forms
for
the
first
time
and
who
was
doubtful
what
sort
of
reception
was
to
accompany
his
first
appearance
before
his
sovereign
heriot
in
anxious
attention
to
save
his
young
friend
from
any
momentary
awkwardness
had
taken
care
to
give
the
necessary
password
to
the
warders
grooms
of
the
chambers
ushers
or
by
whatever
name
they
were
designated
so
they
passed
on
without
interruption
in
this
manner
they
passed
several
filled
chiefly
with
guards
attendants
of
the
court
and
their
acquaintances
male
and
female
who
dressed
in
their
best
apparel
and
with
eyes
rounded
by
eager
curiosity
to
make
the
most
of
their
opportunity
stood
with
beseeming
modesty
ranked
against
the
wall
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
they
were
spectators
not
performers
in
the
courtly
exhibition
through
these
exterior
apartments
lord
glenvarloch
and
his
city
friend
advanced
into
a
large
and
splendid
communicating
with
the
into
which
were
admitted
those
only
who
from
birth
their
posts
in
the
state
or
household
or
by
the
particular
grant
of
the
kings
had
right
to
attend
the
court
as
men
entitled
to
pay
their
respects
to
their
sovereign
amid
this
favoured
and
selected
company
nigel
observed
sir
mungo
malagrowther
who
avoided
and
discountenanced
by
those
who
knew
how
low
he
stood
in
court
interest
and
favour
was
but
too
happy
in
the
opportunity
of
hooking
himself
upon
a
person
of
lord
glenvarloch
rank
who
was
as
yet
so
inexperienced
as
to
feel
it
difficult
to
shake
off
an
intruder
the
knight
forthwith
framed
his
grim
features
to
a
ghastly
smile
and
after
a
preliminary
and
patronising
nod
to
george
heriot
accompanied
with
an
aristocratic
wave
of
the
hand
which
intimated
at
once
superiority
and
protection
he
laid
aside
altogether
the
honest
citizen
to
whom
he
owed
many
a
dinner
to
attach
himself
exclusively
to
the
young
lord
although
he
suspected
he
might
be
occasionally
in
the
predicament
of
needing
one
as
much
as
himself
and
even
the
notice
of
this
original
singular
and
unamiable
as
he
was
was
not
entirely
indifferent
to
lord
glenvarloch
since
the
absolute
and
somewhat
constrained
silence
of
his
good
friend
heriot
which
left
him
at
liberty
to
retire
painfully
to
his
own
agitating
reflections
was
now
relieved
while
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
help
feeling
interest
in
the
sharp
and
sarcastic
information
poured
upon
him
by
an
observant
though
discontented
courtier
to
whom
a
patient
auditor
and
he
a
man
of
title
and
rank
was
as
much
a
prize
as
his
acute
and
communicative
disposition
rendered
him
an
entertaining
companion
to
nigel
olifaunt
heriot
in
the
meantime
neglected
by
sir
mungo
and
avoiding
every
attempt
by
which
the
grateful
politeness
of
lord
glenvarloch
strove
to
bring
him
into
the
conversation
stood
by
with
a
kind
of
half
smile
on
his
countenance
but
whether
excited
by
sir
mungo
wit
or
arising
at
his
expense
did
not
exactly
appear
in
the
meantime
the
trio
occupied
a
nook
of
the
next
to
the
door
of
the
which
was
not
yet
thrown
open
when
maxwell
with
his
rod
of
office
came
bustling
into
the
apartment
where
most
men
excepting
those
of
high
rank
made
way
for
him
he
stopped
beside
the
party
in
which
we
are
interested
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
young
scots
nobleman
then
made
a
slight
obeisance
to
heriot
and
lastly
addressing
sir
mungo
malagrowther
began
a
hurried
complaint
to
him
of
the
misbehaviour
of
the
and
warders
who
suffered
all
sort
of
citizens
suitors
and
scriveners
to
sneak
into
the
outer
apartments
without
either
respect
or
the
english
he
said
were
scandalised
for
such
a
thing
durst
not
be
attempted
in
the
queen
days
in
her
time
there
was
then
the
for
the
mobility
and
the
apartments
for
the
nobility
and
it
reflects
on
your
place
sir
mungo
he
added
belonging
to
the
household
as
you
do
that
such
things
should
not
be
better
here
sir
mungo
afflicted
as
was
frequently
the
case
on
such
occasions
with
one
of
his
usual
fits
of
deafness
answered
it
was
no
wonder
the
mobility
used
freedoms
when
those
whom
they
saw
in
office
were
so
little
better
in
blood
and
havings
than
you
are
right
sir
quite
right
said
maxwell
putting
his
hand
on
the
tarnished
embroidery
on
the
old
knight
sleeve
when
such
fellows
see
men
in
office
dressed
in
suits
like
paltry
it
is
no
wonder
the
court
is
thronged
with
were
you
lauding
the
taste
of
my
embroidery
maister
maxwell
answered
the
knight
who
apparently
interpreted
the
meaning
rather
from
his
action
than
his
words
it
is
of
an
ancient
and
liberal
pattern
having
been
made
by
your
mother
father
auld
james
stitchell
a
of
honest
repute
in
merlin
wynd
whom
i
made
a
point
to
employ
as
i
am
now
happy
to
remember
seeing
your
father
thought
fit
to
intermarry
with
sic
a
person
maxwell
looked
stern
but
conscious
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
of
sir
mungo
in
the
way
of
amends
and
that
prosecuting
the
quarrel
with
such
an
adversary
would
only
render
him
ridiculous
and
make
public
a
of
which
he
had
no
reason
to
be
proud
he
covered
his
resentment
with
a
sneer
and
expressing
his
regret
that
sir
mungo
was
become
too
deaf
to
understand
or
attend
to
what
was
said
to
him
walked
on
and
planted
himself
beside
the
of
the
at
which
he
was
to
perform
the
duty
of
or
usher
so
soon
as
they
should
be
opened
the
door
of
the
presence
is
about
to
open
said
the
goldsmith
in
a
whisper
to
his
young
friend
my
condition
permits
me
to
go
no
farther
with
you
fail
not
to
present
yourself
boldly
according
to
your
birth
and
offer
your
supplication
which
the
king
will
not
refuse
to
accept
and
as
i
hope
to
consider
as
he
spoke
the
door
of
the
opened
accordingly
and
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
the
courtiers
began
to
advance
towards
it
and
to
enter
in
a
slow
but
continuous
and
uninterrupted
stream
as
nigel
presented
himself
in
his
turn
at
the
entrance
and
mentioned
his
name
and
title
maxwell
seemed
to
hesitate
you
are
not
known
to
any
one
he
said
it
is
my
duty
to
suffer
no
one
to
pass
to
the
presence
my
lord
whose
face
is
unknown
to
me
unless
upon
the
word
of
a
responsible
i
came
with
master
george
heriot
said
nigel
in
some
embarrassment
at
this
unexpected
interruption
master
heriot
name
will
pass
current
for
much
gold
and
silver
my
lord
replied
maxwell
with
a
civil
sneer
but
not
for
birth
and
rank
i
am
compelled
by
my
office
to
be
the
entrance
is
impeded
i
am
much
concerned
to
say
it
your
lordship
must
stand
what
is
the
matter
said
an
old
scottish
nobleman
who
had
been
speaking
with
george
heriot
after
he
had
separated
from
nigel
and
who
now
came
forward
observing
the
altercation
betwixt
the
latter
and
maxwell
it
is
only
master
maxwell
said
sir
mungo
malagrowther
expressing
his
joy
to
see
lord
glenvarloch
at
court
whose
father
gave
him
his
office
at
least
i
think
he
is
speaking
to
that
purport
for
your
lordship
kens
my
a
subdued
laugh
such
as
the
situation
permitted
passed
round
amongst
those
who
heard
this
specimen
of
sir
mungo
sarcastic
temper
but
the
old
nobleman
stepped
still
more
forward
saying
what
the
son
of
my
gallant
old
opponent
ochtred
olifaunt
i
will
introduce
him
to
the
presence
so
saying
he
took
nigel
by
the
arm
without
farther
ceremony
and
was
about
to
lead
him
forward
when
maxwell
still
keeping
his
rod
across
the
door
said
but
with
hesitation
and
embarrassment
my
lord
this
gentleman
is
not
known
and
i
have
orders
to
be
tutti
taiti
man
said
the
old
lord
i
will
be
answerable
he
is
his
father
son
from
the
cut
of
his
eyebrow
and
thou
maxwell
knewest
his
father
well
enough
to
have
spared
thy
scruples
let
us
pass
so
saying
he
put
aside
the
rod
and
entered
the
still
holding
the
young
nobleman
by
the
arm
why
i
must
know
you
man
he
said
i
must
know
you
i
knew
your
father
well
man
and
i
have
broke
a
lance
and
crossed
a
blade
with
him
and
it
is
to
my
credit
that
i
am
living
to
brag
of
it
he
was
and
i
was
during
the
douglas
wars
young
fellows
both
that
feared
neither
fire
nor
steel
and
we
had
some
old
feudal
quarrels
besides
that
had
come
down
from
father
to
son
with
our
and
and
the
crests
on
our
too
loud
my
lord
of
huntinglen
whispered
a
gentleman
of
the
chamber
the
king
the
king
the
old
earl
for
such
he
proved
took
the
hint
and
was
silent
and
james
advancing
from
a
received
in
succession
the
compliments
of
strangers
while
a
little
group
of
favourite
courtiers
or
officers
of
the
household
stood
around
him
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
from
time
to
time
some
more
pains
had
been
bestowed
on
his
toilette
than
upon
the
occasion
when
we
first
presented
the
monarch
to
our
readers
but
there
was
a
natural
awkwardness
about
his
figure
which
prevented
his
clothes
from
sitting
handsomely
and
the
prudence
or
timidity
of
his
disposition
had
made
him
adopt
the
custom
already
noticed
of
wearing
a
dress
so
thickly
quilted
as
might
withstand
the
stroke
of
a
dagger
which
added
an
ungainly
stiffness
to
his
whole
appearance
contrasting
oddly
with
the
frivolous
ungraceful
and
fidgeting
motions
with
which
he
accompanied
his
conversation
and
yet
though
the
king
deportment
was
very
undignified
he
had
a
manner
so
kind
familiar
and
was
so
little
apt
to
veil
over
or
conceal
his
own
foibles
and
had
so
much
indulgence
and
sympathy
for
those
of
others
that
his
address
joined
to
his
learning
and
a
certain
proportion
of
shrewd
failed
not
to
make
a
favourable
impression
on
those
who
approached
his
person
when
the
earl
of
huntinglen
had
presented
nigel
to
his
sovereign
a
ceremony
which
the
good
peer
took
upon
himself
the
king
received
the
young
lord
very
graciously
and
observed
to
his
introducer
that
he
was
fain
to
see
them
twa
stand
side
by
side
for
i
trow
my
lord
huntinglen
continued
he
your
ancestors
ay
and
your
self
and
this
lad
father
have
stood
front
to
front
at
the
point
and
that
is
a
worse
until
your
majesty
said
lord
huntinglen
made
lord
ochtred
and
me
cross
palms
upon
the
memorable
day
when
your
majesty
feasted
all
the
nobles
that
were
at
feud
together
and
made
them
join
hands
in
your
presence
i
mind
it
weel
said
the
king
i
mind
it
weel
it
was
a
blessed
day
being
the
nineteen
of
september
of
all
days
in
the
year
and
it
was
a
blithe
sport
to
see
how
some
of
the
carles
girned
as
they
clapped
loofs
together
by
my
saul
i
thought
some
of
them
mair
special
the
hieland
chiels
wad
have
broken
out
in
our
own
presence
but
we
caused
them
to
march
hand
in
hand
to
the
cross
ourselves
leading
the
way
and
there
drink
a
blithe
cup
of
kindness
with
ilk
other
to
the
stanching
of
feud
and
perpetuation
of
amity
auld
john
anderson
was
provost
that
year
the
carle
grat
for
joy
and
the
bailies
and
councillors
danced
in
our
presence
like
colts
for
very
it
was
indeed
a
happy
day
said
lord
huntinglen
and
will
not
be
forgotten
in
the
history
of
your
majesty
i
would
not
that
it
were
my
lord
replied
the
monarch
i
would
not
that
it
were
pretermitted
in
our
annals

that
ever

of
my

if
james
with
the
fiery

had
come
amongst
you
he
said

round
him

my

nobleman

our
sovereign

said
the
king
and
by
my
saul

modest
and
ingenuous
youth
that
hath
not
forgotten
how
to
blush
like
most
of
our
travelled
monsieurs
we
will
treat
him
then
drawing
himself
up
coughing
slightly
and
looking
around
him
with
the
conscious
importance
of
superior
learning
while
all
the
courtiers
who
understood
or
understood
not
latin
pressed
eagerly
forward
to
listen
the
sapient
monarch
prosecuted
his
inquiries
as
follows

replied
by

and
the

turning

in
a

controversy
with

the
king
had
taken
so
deep
an
interest
as
at
length
to
hint
in
his
public
correspondence
with

as

willing
to
become

for
fagots
in
defence
of
the
latinity
of

university
as
for
any
article
of

creed
the
king
without
awaiting
an
answer
from
either
prelate
proceeded
to
question
lord
nigel
but
in
the
vernacular
tongue
weel
my
likely
alumnus
of
the
muses
and
what
make
you
so
far
from
the
north
to
pay
my
homage
to
your
majesty
said
the
young
nobleman
kneeling
on
one
knee
and
to
lay
before
you
he
added
this
my
humble
and
dutiful
the
presenting
of
a
pistol
would
certainly
have
startled
king
james
more
but
could
setting
apart
the
fright
hardly
have
been
more
unpleasing
to
his
indolent
disposition
and
is
it
even
so
man
said
he
and
can
no
single
man
were
it
but
for
the
rarity
of
the
case
ever
come
up
frae
scotland
excepting
ex
proposito
on
set
purpose
to
see
what
he
can
make
out
of
his
loving
sovereign
it
is
but
three
days
syne
that
we
had
weel
nigh
lost
our
life
and
put
three
kingdoms
into
from
the
over
haste
of
a
peasant
to
thrust
a
packet
into
our
hand
and
now
we
are
beset
by
the
like
impediment
in
our
very
court
to
our
secretary
with
that
gear
my
lord
to
our
secretary
with
that
i
have
already
offered
my
humble
supplication
to
your
secretary
of
state
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
it
seems
that
he
would
not
receive
it
i
warrant
said
the
king
interrupting
him
bu
my
saul
our
secretary
kens
that
point
of
called
refusing
better
than
we
do
and
will
look
at
nothing
but
what
he
likes
himsell
i
think
i
wad
make
a
better
secretary
to
him
than
he
to
weel
my
lord
you
are
welcome
to
london
and
as
ye
seem
an
acute
and
learned
youth
i
advise
ye
to
turn
your
neb
northward
as
soon
as
ye
like
and
settle
yoursell
for
a
while
at
saint
andrews
and
we
will
be
right
glad
to
hear
that
you
prosper
in
your
remis
while
the
king
spoke
thus
he
held
the
petition
of
the
young
lord
carelessly
like
one
who
only
delayed
till
the
supplicant
back
was
turned
to
throw
it
away
or
at
least
lay
it
aside
to
be
no
more
looked
at
the
petitioner
who
read
this
in
his
cold
and
indifferent
looks
and
in
the
manner
in
which
he
twisted
and
crumpled
together
the
paper
arose
with
a
bitter
sense
of
anger
and
disappointment
made
a
profound
obeisance
and
was
about
to
retire
hastily
but
lord
huntinglen
who
stood
by
him
checked
his
intention
by
an
almost
imperceptible
touch
upon
the
skirt
of
his
cloak
and
nigel
taking
the
hint
retreated
only
a
few
steps
from
the
royal
presence
and
then
made
a
pause
in
the
meantime
lord
huntinglen
kneeled
before
james
in
his
turn
and
said
may
it
please
your
majesty
to
remember
that
upon
one
certain
occasion
you
did
promise
to
grant
me
a
boon
every
year
of
your
sacred
life
i
mind
it
weel
man
answered
james
i
mind
it
weel
and
good
reason
why
it
was
when
you
unclasped
the
fause
traitor
ruthven
fangs
from
about
our
royal
throat
and
drove
your
dirk
into
him
like
a
true
subject
we
did
then
as
you
remind
us
whilk
was
unnecessary
being
partly
beside
ourselves
with
joy
at
our
liberation
promise
we
would
grant
you
a
free
boon
every
year
whilk
promise
on
our
coming
to
menseful
possession
of
our
royal
faculties
we
did
confirm
always
and
that
your
lordship
demand
should
be
such
as
we
in
our
royal
discretion
should
think
even
so
gracious
sovereign
said
the
old
earl
and
may
i
yet
farther
crave
to
know
if
i
have
ever
exceeded
the
bounds
of
your
royal
benevolence
by
my
word
man
no
said
the
king
i
can
not
remember
you
have
asked
much
for
yourself
if
it
be
not
a
dog
or
a
hawk
or
a
buck
out
of
our
park
at
theobald
or
such
like
but
to
what
serves
this
preface
to
the
boon
to
which
i
am
now
to
ask
of
your
grace
said
lord
huntinglen
which
is
that
your
majesty
would
be
pleased
on
the
instant
to
look
at
the
placet
of
lord
glenvarloch
and
do
upon
it
what
your
own
just
and
royal
nature
shall
think
meet
and
just
without
reference
to
your
secretary
or
any
other
of
your
by
my
saul
my
lord
this
is
strange
said
the
king
ye
are
pleading
for
the
son
of
your
enemy
of
one
who
was
my
enemy
till
your
majesty
made
him
my
friend
answered
lord
huntinglen
weel
spoken
my
lord
said
the
king
and
with
a
true
christian
spirit
and
respecting
the
supplication
of
this
young
man
i
partly
guess
where
the
matter
lies
and
in
plain
troth
i
had
promised
to
george
heriot
to
be
good
to
the
lad
but
then
here
the
shoe
pinches
steenie
and
babie
charles
can
not
abide
him
neither
can
your
own
son
my
lord
and
so
methinks
he
had
better
go
down
to
scotland
before
he
comes
toill
luck
by
my
son
an
it
please
your
majesty
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
shall
not
direct
my
doings
said
the
earl
nor
any
young
man
of
them
why
neither
shall
they
mine
replied
the
monarch
by
my
saul
none
of
them
all
shall
play
rex
with
me
i
will
do
what
i
will
and
what
i
ought
like
a
free
your
majesty
will
then
grant
me
my
boon
said
the
lord
huntinglen
ay
marry
will
i
marry
will
i
said
the
king
but
follow
me
this
way
man
where
we
may
be
more
he
led
lord
huntinglen
with
rather
a
hurried
step
through
the
courtiers
all
of
whom
gazed
earnestly
on
this
unwonted
scene
as
is
the
fashion
of
all
courts
on
similar
occasions
the
king
passed
into
a
little
cabinet
and
bade
in
the
first
moment
lord
huntinglen
lock
or
bar
the
door
but
countermanded
his
direction
in
the
next
saying
no
no
no
bread
life
man
i
am
a
free
king
will
do
what
i
will
and
what
i
should
i
am
et
tenax
man
nevertheless
keep
by
the
door
lord
huntinglen
in
case
steenie
should
come
in
with
his
mad
o
my
poor
master
groaned
the
earl
of
huntinglen
when
you
were
in
your
own
cold
country
you
had
warmer
blood
in
your
the
king
hastily
looked
over
the
petition
or
memorial
every
now
and
then
glancing
his
eye
towards
the
door
and
then
sinking
it
hastily
on
the
paper
ashamed
that
lord
huntinglen
whom
he
respected
should
suspect
him
of
timidity
to
grant
the
truth
he
said
after
he
had
finished
his
hasty
perusal
this
is
a
hard
case
and
harder
than
it
was
represented
to
me
though
i
had
some
inkling
of
it
before
and
so
the
lad
only
wants
payment
of
the
siller
due
from
us
in
order
to
reclaim
his
paternal
estate
but
then
huntinglen
the
lad
will
have
other
debts
and
why
burden
himsell
with
sae
mony
acres
of
barren
woodland
let
the
land
gang
man
let
the
land
gang
steenie
has
the
promise
of
it
from
our
scottish
chancellor
it
is
the
best
in
scotland
and
babie
charles
and
steenie
want
to
kill
a
buck
there
this
next
year
they
maun
hae
the
land
they
maun
hae
the
land
and
our
debt
shall
be
paid
to
the
young
man
plack
and
bawbee
and
he
may
have
the
spending
of
it
at
our
court
or
if
he
has
such
an
eard
hunger
wouns
man
we
stuff
his
stomach
with
english
land
which
is
worth
twice
as
much
ay
ten
times
as
much
as
these
accursed
hills
and
heughs
and
mosses
and
muirs
that
he
is
sae
keen
all
this
while
the
poor
king
ambled
up
and
down
the
apartment
in
a
piteous
state
of
uncertainty
which
was
made
more
ridiculous
by
his
shambling
circular
mode
of
managing
his
legs
and
his
ungainly
fashion
on
such
occasions
of
fiddling
with
the
bunches
of
ribbons
which
fastened
the
lower
part
of
his
dress
lord
huntinglen
listened
with
great
composure
and
answered
an
it
please
your
majesty
there
was
an
answer
yielded
by
naboth
when
ahab
coveted
his
vineyard
the
lord
forbid
that
i
should
give
the
inheritance
of
my
fathers
unto
thee
ey
my
lord
ey
my
lord
ejaculated
james
while
all
the
colour
mounted
both
to
his
cheek
and
nose
i
hope
ye
mean
not
to
teach
me
divinity
ye
need
not
fear
my
lord
that
i
will
shun
to
do
justice
to
every
man
and
since
your
lordship
will
give
me
no
help
to
take
up
this
in
a
more
peaceful
manner
whilk
methinks
would
be
better
for
the
young
man
as
i
said
before
why
since
it
maun
be
so
i
am
a
free
king
man
and
he
shall
have
his
money
and
redeem
his
land
and
make
a
kirk
and
a
miln
of
it
an
he
so
saying
he
hastily
wrote
an
order
on
the
scottish
exchequer
for
the
sum
in
question
and
then
added
how
they
are
to
pay
it
i
see
not
but
i
warrant
he
will
find
money
on
the
order
among
the
goldsmiths
who
can
find
it
for
every
one
but
and
now
you
see
my
lord
of
huntinglen
that
i
am
neither
an
untrue
man
to
deny
you
the
boon
whilk
i
became
bound
for
nor
an
ahab
to
covet
naboth
vineyard
nor
a
mere
to
be
twisted
this
way
and
that
by
favourites
and
counsellors
at
their
pleasure
i
think
you
will
grant
now
that
i
am
none
of
those
you
are
my
own
native
and
noble
prince
said
huntinglen
as
he
knelt
to
kiss
the
royal
hand
just
and
generous
whenever
you
listen
to
the
workings
of
your
own
ay
ay
said
the
king
laughing
as
he
raised
his
faithful
servant
from
the
ground
that
is
what
ye
all
say
when
i
do
any
thing
to
please
ye
there
there
take
the
and
away
with
you
and
this
young
fellow
i
wonder
steenie
and
babie
charles
have
not
broken
in
on
us
before
lord
huntinglen
hastened
from
the
cabinet
foreseeing
a
scene
at
which
he
was
unwilling
to
be
present
but
which
sometimes
occurred
when
james
roused
himself
so
far
as
to
exert
his
own
free
will
of
which
he
boasted
so
much
in
spite
of
that
of
his
imperious
favourite
steenie
as
he
called
the
duke
of
buckingham
from
a
supposed
resemblance
betwixt
his
very
handsome
countenance
and
that
with
which
the
italian
artists
represented
the
protomartyr
stephen
in
fact
the
haughty
favourite
who
had
the
unusual
good
fortune
to
stand
as
high
in
the
opinion
of
the
as
of
the
existing
monarch
had
considerably
diminished
in
his
respect
towards
the
latter
and
it
was
apparent
to
the
more
shrewd
courtiers
that
james
endured
his
domination
rather
from
habit
timidity
and
a
dread
of
encountering
his
stormy
passions
than
from
any
heartfelt
continuation
of
regard
towards
him
whose
greatness
had
been
the
work
of
his
own
hands
to
save
himself
the
pain
of
seeing
what
was
likely
to
take
place
on
the
duke
return
and
to
preserve
the
king
from
the
additional
humiliation
which
the
presence
of
such
a
witness
must
have
occasioned
the
earl
left
the
cabinet
as
speedily
as
possible
having
first
carefully
pocketed
the
important
no
sooner
had
he
entered
the
than
he
hastily
sought
lord
glenvarloch
who
had
withdrawn
into
the
embrasure
of
one
of
the
windows
from
the
general
gaze
of
men
who
seemed
disposed
only
to
afford
him
the
notice
which
arises
from
surprise
and
curiosity
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
without
speaking
led
him
out
of
the
into
the
first
here
they
found
the
worthy
goldsmith
who
approached
them
with
looks
of
curiosity
which
were
checked
by
the
old
lord
who
said
hastily
all
is
is
your
barge
in
waiting
heriot
answered
in
the
affirmative
then
said
lord
huntinglen
you
shall
give
me
a
cast
in
it
as
the
watermen
say
and
i
in
requital
will
give
you
both
your
dinner
for
we
must
have
some
conversation
they
both
followed
the
earl
without
speaking
and
were
in
the
second
when
the
important
annunciation
of
the
ushers
and
the
hasty
murmur
with
which
all
made
ample
way
as
the
company
repeated
to
each
other
the
duke
the
duke
made
them
aware
of
the
approach
of
the
omnipotent
favourite
he
entered
that
unhappy
minion
of
court
favour
sumptuously
dressed
in
the
picturesque
attire
which
will
live
for
ever
on
the
canvas
of
vandyke
and
which
marks
so
well
the
proud
age
when
aristocracy
though
undermined
and
nodding
to
its
fall
still
by
external
show
and
profuse
expense
endeavoured
to
assert
its
paramount
superiority
over
the
inferior
orders
the
handsome
and
commanding
countenance
stately
form
and
graceful
action
and
manners
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
made
him
become
that
picturesque
dress
beyond
any
man
of
his
time
at
present
however
his
countenance
seemed
discomposed
his
dress
a
little
more
disordered
than
became
the
place
his
step
hasty
and
his
voice
imperative
all
marked
the
angry
spot
upon
his
brow
and
bore
back
so
suddenly
to
make
way
for
him
that
the
earl
of
huntinglen
who
affected
no
extraordinary
haste
on
the
occasion
with
his
companions
who
could
not
if
they
would
have
decently
left
him
remained
as
it
were
by
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
in
the
very
path
of
the
angry
favourite
he
touched
his
cap
sternly
as
he
looked
on
huntinglen
but
unbonneted
to
heriot
and
sunk
his
beaver
with
its
shadowy
plume
as
low
as
the
floor
with
a
profound
air
of
mock
respect
in
returning
his
greeting
which
he
did
simply
and
unaffectedly
the
citizen
only
said
too
much
courtesy
my
lord
duke
is
often
the
reverse
of
i
grieve
you
should
think
so
master
heriot
answered
the
duke
i
only
meant
by
my
homage
to
claim
your
protection
sir
your
patronage
you
are
become
i
understand
a
solicitor
of
suits
a
promoter
an
undertaker
a
fautor
of
court
suitors
of
merit
and
quality
who
chance
to
be
pennyless
i
trust
your
bags
will
bear
you
out
in
your
new
they
will
bear
me
the
farther
my
lord
duke
answered
the
goldsmith
that
my
boast
is
but
o
you
do
yourself
less
than
justice
my
good
master
heriot
continued
the
duke
in
the
same
tone
of
irony
you
have
a
marvellous
to
be
the
son
of
an
edinburgh
tinker
have
the
goodness
to
prefer
me
to
the
knowledge
of
the
nobleman
who
is
honoured
and
advantaged
by
your
that
shall
be
my
task
said
lord
huntinglen
with
emphasis
my
lord
duke
i
desire
you
to
know
nigel
olifaunt
lord
glenvarloch
representative
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
powerful
baronial
houses
in
lord
glenvarloch
i
present
you
to
his
grace
the
duke
of
buckingham
representative
of
sir
george
villiers
knight
of
brookesby
in
the
county
of
the
duke
coloured
still
more
high
as
he
bowed
to
lord
glenvarloch
scornfully
a
courtesy
which
the
other
returned
haughtily
and
with
restrained
indignation
we
know
each
other
then
said
the
duke
after
a
moment
pause
and
as
if
he
had
seen
something
in
the
young
nobleman
which
merited
more
serious
notice
than
the
bitter
raillery
with
which
he
had
commenced
we
know
each
other
and
you
know
me
my
lord
for
your
i
thank
you
for
your
plainness
my
lord
duke
replied
nigel
an
open
enemy
is
better
than
a
hollow
for
you
my
lord
huntinglen
said
the
duke
methinks
you
have
but
now
overstepped
the
limits
of
the
indulgence
permitted
to
you
as
the
father
of
the
prince
friend
and
my
by
my
word
my
lord
duke
replied
the
earl
it
is
easy
for
any
one
to
outstep
boundaries
of
the
existence
of
which
he
was
not
aware
it
is
neither
to
secure
my
protection
nor
approbation
that
my
son
keeps
such
exalted
o
my
lord
we
know
you
and
indulge
you
said
the
duke
you
are
one
of
those
who
presume
for
a
upon
the
merit
of
one
good
in
faith
my
lord
and
if
it
be
so
said
the
old
earl
i
have
at
least
the
advantage
of
such
as
presume
more
than
i
do
without
having
done
any
action
of
merit
whatever
but
i
mean
not
to
quarrel
with
you
my
lord
we
can
neither
be
friends
nor
enemies
you
have
your
path
and
i
have
buckingham
only
replied
by
throwing
on
his
bonnet
and
shaking
its
lofty
plume
with
a
careless
and
scornful
toss
of
the
head
they
parted
thus
the
duke
walking
onwards
through
the
apartments
and
the
others
leaving
the
palace
and
repairing
to
whitehall
stairs
where
they
embarked
on
board
the
barge
of
the
citizen
chapter
x
bid
not
thy
fortune
troll
upon
the
wheels
of
yonder
dancing
cubes
of
mottled
bone
and
drown
it
not
like
egypt
royal
harlot
dissolving
her
rich
pearl
in
the
brimm
these
are
the
arts
lothario
which
shrink
acres
into
brief
yards
bring
sterling
pounds
to
farthings
credit
to
infamy
and
the
poor
gull
who
might
have
lived
an
honour
easy
life
to
ruin
and
an
unregarded
grave
when
they
were
fairly
embarked
on
the
thames
the
earl
took
from
his
pocket
the
supplication
and
pointing
out
to
george
heriot
the
royal
warrant
indorsed
thereon
asked
him
if
it
were
in
due
and
regular
form
the
worthy
citizen
hastily
read
it
over
thrust
forth
his
hand
as
if
to
congratulate
the
lord
glenvarloch
then
checked
himself
pulled
out
his
barnacles
a
present
from
old
david
ramsay
and
again
perused
the
warrant
with
the
most
and
critical
attention
it
is
strictly
correct
and
formal
he
said
looking
to
the
earl
of
huntinglen
and
i
sincerely
rejoice
at
i
doubt
nothing
of
its
formality
said
the
earl
the
king
understands
business
well
and
if
he
does
not
practise
it
often
it
is
only
because
indolence
obscures
parts
which
are
naturally
well
qualified
for
the
discharge
of
affairs
but
what
is
next
to
be
done
for
our
young
friend
master
heriot
you
know
how
i
am
circumstanced
scottish
lords
living
at
the
english
court
have
seldom
command
of
money
yet
unless
a
sum
can
be
presently
raised
on
this
warrant
matters
standing
as
you
hastily
hinted
to
me
the
mortgage
wadset
or
whatever
it
is
called
will
be
it
is
true
said
heriot
in
some
embarrassment
there
is
a
large
sum
wanted
in
redemption
yet
if
it
is
not
raised
there
will
be
an
expiry
of
the
legal
as
our
lawyers
call
it
and
the
estate
will
be
my
noble
my
worthy
friends
who
have
taken
up
my
cause
so
undeservedly
so
unexpectedly
said
nigel
do
not
let
me
be
a
burden
on
your
kindness
you
have
already
done
too
much
where
nothing
was
peace
man
peace
said
lord
huntinglen
and
let
old
heriot
and
i
puzzle
this
scent
out
he
is
about
to
open
hark
to
him
my
lord
said
the
citizen
the
duke
of
buckingham
sneers
at
our
city
yet
they
can
sometimes
open
to
prop
a
falling
and
a
noble
we
know
they
can
said
lord
huntinglen
mind
not
buckingham
he
is
a
and
now
for
the
i
partly
hinted
to
lord
glenvarloch
already
said
heriot
that
the
redemption
money
might
be
advanced
upon
such
a
warrant
as
the
present
and
i
will
engage
my
credit
that
it
can
but
then
in
order
to
secure
the
lender
he
must
come
in
the
shoes
of
the
creditor
to
whom
he
advances
come
in
his
shoes
replied
the
earl
why
what
have
boots
or
shoes
to
do
with
this
matter
my
good
friend
it
is
a
law
phrase
my
lord
my
experience
has
made
me
pick
up
a
few
of
them
said
heriot
ay
and
of
better
things
along
with
them
master
george
replied
lord
huntinglen
but
what
means
it
simply
this
resumed
the
citizen
that
the
lender
of
this
money
will
transact
with
the
holder
of
the
mortgage
or
wadset
over
the
estate
of
glenvarloch
and
obtain
from
him
such
a
conveyance
to
his
right
as
shall
leave
the
lands
pledged
for
the
debt
in
case
the
warrant
upon
the
scottish
exchequer
should
prove
unproductive
i
fear
in
this
uncertainty
of
public
credit
that
without
some
such
counter
security
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
find
so
large
a
ho
la
said
the
earl
of
huntinglen
halt
there
a
thought
strikes
what
if
the
new
creditor
should
admire
the
estate
as
a
as
much
as
my
lord
grace
of
buckingham
seems
to
do
and
should
wish
to
kill
a
buck
there
in
the
summer
season
it
seems
to
me
that
on
your
plan
master
george
our
new
friend
will
be
as
well
entitled
to
block
lord
glenvarloch
out
of
his
inheritance
as
the
present
holder
of
the
the
citizen
laughed
i
will
engage
he
said
that
the
keenest
sportsman
to
whom
i
may
apply
on
this
occasion
shall
not
have
a
thought
beyond
the
lord
mayor
in
epping
forest
but
your
lordship
caution
is
reasonable
the
creditor
must
be
bound
to
allow
lord
glenvarloch
sufficient
time
to
redeem
his
estate
by
means
of
the
royal
warrant
and
must
wave
in
his
favour
the
right
of
instant
foreclosure
which
may
be
i
should
think
the
more
easily
managed
as
the
right
of
redemption
must
be
exercised
in
his
own
but
where
shall
we
find
a
person
in
london
fit
to
draw
the
necessary
writings
said
the
earl
if
my
old
friend
sir
john
skene
of
halyards
had
lived
we
should
have
had
his
advice
but
time
presses
and
i
know
said
heriot
an
orphan
lad
a
scrivener
that
dwells
by
temple
bar
he
can
draw
deeds
both
after
the
english
and
scottish
fashion
and
i
have
trusted
him
often
in
matters
of
weight
and
of
importance
i
will
send
one
of
my
for
him
and
the
mutual
deeds
may
be
executed
in
your
lordship
presence
for
as
things
stand
there
should
be
no
his
lordship
readily
assented
and
as
they
now
landed
upon
the
private
stairs
leading
down
to
the
river
from
the
gardens
of
the
handsome
hotel
which
he
inhabited
the
messenger
was
dispatched
without
loss
of
time
nigel
who
had
sat
almost
stupefied
while
these
zealous
friends
volunteered
for
him
in
arranging
the
measures
by
which
his
fortune
was
to
be
disembarrassed
now
made
another
eager
attempt
to
force
upon
them
his
broken
expressions
of
thanks
and
gratitude
but
he
was
again
silenced
by
lord
huntinglen
who
declared
he
would
not
hear
a
word
on
that
topic
and
proposed
instead
that
they
should
take
a
turn
in
the
pleached
alley
or
sit
upon
the
stone
bench
which
overlooked
the
thames
until
his
son
arrival
should
give
the
signal
for
dinner
i
desire
to
introduce
dalgarno
and
lord
glenvarloch
to
each
other
he
said
as
two
who
will
be
near
neighbours
and
i
trust
will
be
more
kind
ones
than
their
fathers
were
formerly
there
is
but
three
scots
miles
betwixt
the
castles
and
the
turrets
of
the
one
are
visible
from
the
battlements
of
the
the
old
earl
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
appeared
to
muse
upon
the
recollections
which
the
vicinity
of
the
castles
had
summoned
up
does
lord
dalgarno
follow
the
court
to
newmarket
next
week
said
heriot
by
way
of
removing
the
conversation
he
proposes
so
i
think
answered
lord
huntinglen
relapsed
into
his
reverie
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
addressed
nigel
somewhat
abruptly
my
young
friend
when
you
attain
possession
of
your
inheritance
as
i
hope
you
soon
will
i
trust
you
will
not
add
one
to
the
idle
followers
of
the
court
but
reside
on
your
patrimonial
estate
cherish
your
ancient
tenants
relieve
and
assist
your
poor
kinsmen
protect
the
poor
against
subaltern
oppression
and
do
what
our
fathers
used
to
do
with
fewer
lights
and
with
less
means
than
we
and
yet
the
advice
to
keep
the
country
said
heriot
comes
from
an
ancient
and
constant
ornament
of
the
from
an
old
courtier
indeed
said
the
earl
and
the
first
of
my
family
that
could
so
write
himself
my
grey
beard
falls
on
a
cambric
ruff
and
a
silken
doublet
my
father
descended
upon
a
buff
coat
and
a
i
would
not
that
those
days
of
battle
returned
but
i
should
love
well
to
make
the
oaks
of
my
old
forest
of
dalgarno
ring
once
more
with
halloo
and
horn
and
hound
and
to
have
the
old
hall
return
the
hearty
shout
of
my
vassals
and
tenants
as
the
bicker
and
the
quaigh
walked
their
rounds
amongst
them
i
should
like
to
see
the
broad
tay
once
more
before
i
die
not
even
the
thames
can
match
it
in
my
surely
my
lord
said
the
citizen
all
this
might
be
easily
done
it
costs
but
a
moment
resolution
and
the
journey
of
some
brief
days
and
you
will
be
where
you
desire
to
be
what
is
there
to
prevent
you
habits
master
george
habits
replied
the
earl
which
to
young
men
are
like
threads
of
silk
so
lightly
are
they
worn
so
soon
broken
but
which
hang
on
our
old
limbs
as
if
time
had
stiffened
them
into
gyves
of
iron
to
go
to
scotland
for
a
brief
space
were
but
labour
in
vain
and
when
i
think
of
abiding
there
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
leave
my
old
master
to
whom
i
fancy
myself
sometimes
useful
and
whose
weal
and
woe
i
have
shared
for
so
many
years
but
dalgarno
shall
be
a
scottish
has
he
visited
the
north
said
heriot
he
was
there
last
year
and
made
such
a
report
of
the
country
that
the
prince
has
expressed
a
longing
to
see
lord
dalgarno
is
in
high
grace
with
his
highness
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
observed
the
goldsmith
he
is
so
answered
the
earl
i
pray
it
may
be
for
the
advantage
of
them
all
the
prince
is
just
and
equitable
in
his
sentiments
though
cold
and
stately
in
his
manners
and
very
obstinate
in
his
most
trifling
purposes
and
the
duke
noble
and
gallant
and
generous
and
open
is
fiery
ambitious
and
impetuous
dalgarno
has
none
of
these
faults
and
such
as
he
may
have
of
his
own
may
perchance
be
corrected
by
the
society
in
which
he
see
here
he
lord
dalgarno
accordingly
advanced
from
the
farther
end
of
the
alley
to
the
bench
on
which
his
father
and
his
guests
were
seated
so
that
nigel
had
full
leisure
to
peruse
his
countenance
and
figure
he
was
dressed
and
almost
to
extremity
in
the
splendid
fashion
of
the
time
which
suited
well
with
his
age
probably
about
with
a
noble
form
and
fine
countenance
in
which
last
could
easily
be
traced
the
manly
features
of
his
father
but
softened
by
a
more
habitual
air
of
assiduous
courtesy
than
the
stubborn
old
earl
had
ever
condescended
to
assume
towards
the
world
in
general
in
other
respects
his
address
was
gallant
free
and
unencumbered
either
by
pride
or
ceremony
far
remote
certainly
from
the
charge
either
of
haughty
coldness
or
forward
impetuosity
and
so
far
his
father
had
justly
freed
him
from
the
marked
faults
which
he
ascribed
to
the
manners
of
the
prince
and
his
favourite
buckingham
while
the
old
earl
presented
his
young
acquaintance
lord
glenvarloch
to
his
son
as
one
whom
he
would
have
him
love
and
honour
nigel
marked
the
countenance
of
lord
dalgarno
closely
to
see
if
he
could
detect
aught
of
that
secret
dislike
which
the
king
had
in
one
of
his
broken
expostulations
seemed
to
intimate
as
arising
from
a
clashing
of
interests
betwixt
his
new
friend
and
the
great
buckingham
but
nothing
of
this
was
visible
on
the
contrary
lord
dalgarno
received
his
new
acquaintance
with
the
open
frankness
and
courtesy
which
makes
conquest
at
once
when
addressed
to
the
feelings
of
an
ingenuous
young
man
it
need
hardly
be
told
that
his
open
and
friendly
address
met
equally
ready
and
cheerful
acceptation
from
nigel
olifaunt
for
many
months
and
while
a
youth
not
much
above
he
had
been
restrained
by
circumstances
from
the
conversation
of
his
equals
when
on
his
sudden
death
he
left
the
low
countries
for
scotland
he
had
found
himself
involved
to
all
appearance
inextricably
with
the
details
of
the
law
all
of
which
threatened
to
end
in
the
alienation
of
the
patrimony
which
should
support
his
hereditary
rank
his
term
of
sincere
mourning
joined
to
injured
pride
and
the
swelling
of
the
heart
under
unexpected
and
undeserved
misfortune
together
with
the
uncertainty
attending
the
issue
of
his
affairs
had
induced
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
to
live
while
in
scotland
in
a
very
private
and
reserved
manner
how
he
had
passed
his
time
in
london
the
reader
is
acquainted
with
but
this
melancholy
and
secluded
course
of
life
was
neither
agreeable
to
his
age
nor
to
his
temper
which
was
genial
and
sociable
he
hailed
therefore
with
sincere
pleasure
the
approaches
which
a
young
man
of
his
own
age
and
rank
made
towards
him
and
when
he
had
exchanged
with
lord
dalgarno
some
of
those
words
and
signals
by
which
as
surely
as
by
those
of
freemasonry
young
people
recognise
a
mutual
wish
to
be
agreeable
to
each
other
it
seemed
as
if
the
two
noblemen
had
been
acquainted
for
some
time
just
as
this
tacit
intercourse
had
been
established
one
of
lord
huntinglen
attendants
came
down
the
alley
marshalling
onwards
a
man
dressed
in
black
buckram
who
followed
him
with
tolerable
speed
considering
that
according
to
his
sense
of
reverence
and
propriety
he
kept
his
body
bent
and
parallel
to
the
horizon
from
the
moment
that
he
came
in
sight
of
the
company
to
which
he
was
about
to
be
presented
who
is
this
you
cuckoldy
knave
said
the
old
lord
who
had
retained
the
keen
appetite
and
impatience
of
a
scottish
baron
even
during
a
long
alienation
from
his
native
country
and
why
does
john
cook
with
a
murrain
to
him
keep
back
dinner
i
believe
we
are
ourselves
responsible
for
this
person
intrusion
said
george
heriot
this
is
the
scrivener
whom
we
desired
to
look
up
man
and
see
us
in
the
face
as
an
honest
man
should
instead
of
beating
thy
noddle
charged
against
us
thus
like
a
the
scrivener
did
look
up
accordingly
with
the
action
of
an
automaton
which
suddenly
obeys
the
impulse
of
a
pressed
spring
but
strange
to
tell
not
even
the
haste
he
had
made
to
attend
his
patron
mandate
a
business
as
master
heriot
message
expressed
of
weight
and
importance
nay
not
even
the
state
of
depression
in
which
out
of
sheer
humility
doubtless
he
had
his
head
stooped
to
the
earth
from
the
moment
he
had
trod
the
demesnes
of
the
earl
of
huntinglen
had
called
any
colour
into
his
countenance
the
drops
stood
on
his
brow
from
haste
and
toil
but
his
cheek
was
still
pale
and
as
before
nay
what
seemed
stranger
his
very
hair
when
he
raised
his
head
hung
down
on
either
cheek
as
straight
and
sleek
and
undisturbed
as
it
was
when
we
first
introduced
him
to
our
readers
seated
at
his
quiet
and
humble
desk
lord
dalgarno
could
not
forbear
a
stifled
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
and
puritanical
figure
which
presented
itself
like
a
starved
anatomy
to
the
company
and
whispered
at
the
same
time
into
lord
glenvarloch
ear
the
devil
damn
thee
black
thou
loon
where
thou
that
nigel
was
too
little
acquainted
with
the
english
stage
to
understand
a
quotation
which
had
already
grown
matter
of
common
allusion
in
london
lord
dalgarno
saw
that
he
was
not
understood
and
continued
that
fellow
by
his
visage
should
either
be
a
saint
or
a
most
hypocritical
rogue
and
such
is
my
excellent
opinion
of
human
nature
that
i
always
suspect
the
worst
but
they
seem
deep
in
business
will
you
take
a
turn
with
me
in
the
garden
my
lord
or
will
you
remain
a
member
of
the
serious
conclave
with
you
my
lord
most
willingly
said
nigel
and
they
were
turning
away
accordingly
when
george
heriot
with
the
formality
belonging
to
his
station
observed
that
as
their
business
concerned
lord
glenvarloch
he
had
better
remain
to
make
himself
master
of
it
and
witness
to
my
presence
is
utterly
needless
my
good
lord
my
best
friend
master
heriot
said
the
young
nobleman
i
shall
understand
nothing
the
better
for
cumbering
you
with
my
ignorance
in
these
matters
and
can
only
say
at
the
end
as
i
now
say
at
the
beginning
that
i
dare
not
take
the
helm
out
of
the
hand
of
the
kind
pilots
who
have
already
guided
my
course
within
sight
of
a
fair
and
haven
whatever
you
recommend
to
me
as
fitting
i
shall
sign
and
seal
and
the
import
of
the
deeds
i
shall
better
learn
by
a
brief
explanation
from
master
heriot
if
he
will
bestow
so
much
trouble
in
my
behalf
than
by
a
thousand
learned
words
and
law
terms
from
this
person
of
he
is
right
said
lord
huntinglen
our
young
friend
is
right
in
confiding
these
matters
to
you
and
me
master
george
heriot
he
has
not
misplaced
his
master
george
heriot
cast
a
long
look
after
the
two
young
noblemen
who
had
now
walked
down
the
alley
and
at
length
said
he
hath
not
indeed
misplaced
his
confidence
as
your
lordship
well
and
truly
says
but
nevertheless
he
is
not
in
the
right
path
for
it
behoves
every
man
to
become
acquainted
with
his
own
affairs
so
soon
as
he
hath
any
that
are
worth
attending
when
he
had
made
this
observation
they
applied
themselves
with
the
scrivener
to
look
into
various
papers
and
to
direct
in
what
manner
writings
should
be
drawn
which
might
at
once
afford
sufficient
security
to
those
who
were
to
advance
the
money
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
the
right
of
the
young
nobleman
to
redeem
the
family
estate
provided
he
should
obtain
the
means
of
doing
so
by
the
expected
reimbursement
from
the
scottish
exchequer
or
otherwise
it
is
needless
to
enter
into
those
details
but
it
is
not
unimportant
to
mention
as
an
illustration
of
character
that
heriot
went
into
the
most
minute
legal
details
with
a
precision
which
showed
that
experience
had
made
him
master
even
of
the
intricacies
of
scottish
conveyancing
and
that
the
earl
of
huntinglen
though
far
less
acquainted
with
technical
detail
suffered
no
step
of
the
business
to
pass
over
until
he
had
attained
a
general
but
distinct
idea
of
its
import
and
its
propriety
they
seemed
to
be
admirably
seconded
in
their
benevolent
intentions
towards
the
young
lord
glenvarloch
by
the
skill
and
eager
zeal
of
the
scrivener
whom
heriot
had
introduced
to
this
piece
of
business
the
most
important
which
andrew
had
ever
transacted
in
his
life
and
the
particulars
of
which
were
moreover
agitated
in
his
presence
between
an
actual
earl
and
one
whose
wealth
and
character
might
entitle
him
to
be
an
alderman
of
his
ward
if
not
to
be
lord
mayor
in
his
turn
while
they
were
thus
in
eager
conversation
on
business
the
good
earl
even
forgetting
the
calls
of
his
appetite
and
the
delay
of
dinner
in
his
anxiety
to
see
that
the
scrivener
received
proper
instructions
and
that
all
was
rightly
weighed
and
considered
before
dismissing
him
to
engross
the
necessary
deeds
the
two
young
men
walked
together
on
the
terrace
which
overhung
the
river
and
talked
on
the
topics
which
lord
dalgarno
the
elder
and
the
more
experienced
thought
most
likely
to
interest
his
new
friend
these
naturally
regarded
the
pleasures
attending
a
court
life
and
lord
dalgarno
expressed
much
surprise
at
understanding
that
nigel
proposed
an
instant
return
to
scotland
you
are
jesting
with
me
he
said
all
the
court
rings
it
is
needless
to
mince
it
with
the
extraordinary
success
of
your
suit
against
the
highest
interest
it
is
said
now
influencing
the
horizon
at
whitehall
men
think
of
you
talk
of
you
fix
their
eyes
on
you
ask
each
other
who
is
this
young
scottish
lord
who
has
stepped
so
far
in
a
single
day
they
augur
in
whispers
to
each
other
how
high
and
how
far
you
may
push
your
fortune
and
all
that
you
design
to
make
of
it
is
to
return
to
scotland
eat
raw
oatmeal
cakes
baked
upon
a
have
your
hand
shaken
by
every
loon
of
a
who
chooses
to
dub
you
cousin
though
your
relationship
comes
by
noah
drink
scots
twopenny
ale
eat
venison
when
you
can
kill
it
ride
upon
a
galloway
and
be
called
my
right
honourable
and
maist
worthy
lord
there
is
no
great
gaiety
in
the
prospect
before
me
i
confess
said
lord
glenvarloch
even
if
your
father
and
good
master
heriot
should
succeed
in
putting
my
affairs
on
some
footing
of
plausible
hope
and
yet
i
trust
to
do
something
for
my
vassals
as
my
ancestors
before
me
and
to
teach
my
children
as
i
have
myself
been
taught
to
make
some
personal
sacrifices
if
they
be
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
with
dignity
the
situation
in
which
they
are
placed
by
lord
dalgarno
after
having
once
or
twice
stifled
his
laughter
during
this
speech
at
length
broke
out
into
a
fit
of
mirth
so
hearty
and
so
resistless
that
angry
as
he
was
the
call
of
sympathy
swept
nigel
along
with
him
and
despite
of
himself
he
could
not
forbear
to
join
in
a
burst
of
laughter
which
he
thought
not
only
causeless
but
almost
impertinent
he
soon
recollected
himself
however
and
said
in
a
tone
qualified
to
allay
lord
dalgarno
extreme
mirth
this
is
all
well
my
lord
but
how
am
i
to
understand
your
merriment
lord
dalgarno
only
answered
him
with
redoubled
peals
of
laughter
and
at
length
held
by
lord
cloak
as
if
to
prevent
his
falling
down
on
the
ground
in
the
extremity
of
his
convulsion
at
length
while
nigel
stood
half
abashed
half
angry
at
becoming
thus
the
subject
of
his
new
acquaintance
ridicule
and
was
only
restrained
from
expressing
his
resentment
against
the
son
by
a
sense
of
the
obligations
he
owed
the
father
lord
dalgarno
recovered
himself
and
spoke
in
a
voice
his
eyes
still
running
with
tears
i
crave
your
pardon
my
dear
lord
glenvarloch
ten
thousand
times
do
i
crave
your
pardon
but
that
last
picture
of
rural
dignity
accompanied
by
your
grave
and
angry
surprise
at
my
laughing
at
what
would
have
made
any
hound
laugh
that
had
but
so
much
as
bayed
the
moon
once
from
the
at
whitehall
totally
overcame
me
why
my
liefest
and
dearest
lord
you
a
young
and
handsome
fellow
with
high
birth
a
title
and
the
name
of
an
estate
so
well
received
by
the
king
at
your
first
starting
as
makes
your
further
progress
scarce
matter
of
doubt
if
you
know
how
to
improve
it
for
the
king
has
already
said
you
are
a
lad
and
well
studied
in
the
more
humane
letters
you
too
whom
all
the
women
and
the
very
marked
beauties
of
the
court
desire
to
see
because
you
came
from
leyden
were
born
in
scotland
and
have
gained
a
suit
in
england
you
i
say
with
a
person
like
a
prince
an
eye
of
fire
and
a
wit
as
quick
to
think
of
throwing
your
cards
on
the
table
when
the
game
is
in
your
very
hand
running
back
to
the
frozen
north
and
marrying
let
me
see
a
tall
stalking
bony
wench
with
eighteen
quarters
in
her
scutcheon
a
sort
of
lot
wife
newly
descended
from
her
pedestal
and
with
her
to
shut
yourself
up
in
your
tapestried
chamber
uh
gad
swouns
i
shall
never
survive
the
idea
it
is
seldom
that
youth
however
is
able
from
mere
strength
of
character
and
principle
to
support
itself
against
the
force
of
ridicule
half
angry
half
mortified
and
to
say
truth
half
ashamed
of
his
more
manly
and
better
purpose
nigel
was
unable
and
flattered
himself
it
was
unnecessary
to
play
the
part
of
a
rigid
moral
patriot
in
presence
of
a
young
man
whose
current
fluency
of
language
as
well
as
his
experience
in
the
highest
circles
of
society
gave
him
in
spite
of
nigel
better
and
firmer
thoughts
a
temporary
ascendency
over
him
he
sought
therefore
to
compromise
the
matter
and
avoid
farther
debate
by
frankly
owning
that
if
to
return
to
his
own
country
were
not
his
choice
it
was
at
least
a
matter
of
necessity
his
affairs
he
said
were
unsettled
his
income
and
where
is
he
whose
affairs
are
settled
or
whose
income
is
less
than
precarious
that
is
to
be
found
in
attendance
on
the
court
said
lord
dalgarno
all
are
either
losing
or
winning
those
who
have
wealth
come
hither
to
get
rid
of
it
while
the
happy
gallants
who
like
you
and
i
dear
glenvarloch
have
little
or
none
have
every
chance
to
be
sharers
in
their
i
have
no
ambition
of
that
sort
said
nigel
and
if
i
had
i
must
tell
you
plainly
lord
dalgarno
i
have
not
the
means
to
do
so
i
can
scarce
as
yet
call
the
suit
i
wear
my
own
i
owe
it
and
i
do
riot
blush
to
say
so
to
the
friendship
of
yonder
good
i
will
not
laugh
again
if
i
can
help
it
said
lord
dalgarno
but
lord
that
you
should
have
gone
to
a
wealthy
goldsmith
for
your
habit
why
i
could
have
brought
you
to
an
honest
confiding
tailor
who
should
have
furnished
you
with
merely
for
love
of
the
little
word
which
you
place
before
your
name
and
then
your
goldsmith
if
he
be
really
a
friendly
goldsmith
should
have
equipped
you
with
such
a
purse
of
fair
as
would
have
bought
you
thrice
as
many
suits
or
done
better
things
for
i
do
not
understand
these
fashions
my
lord
said
nigel
his
displeasure
mastering
his
shame
were
i
to
attend
the
court
of
my
sovereign
it
should
be
when
i
could
maintain
without
shifting
or
borrowing
the
dress
and
retinue
which
my
rank
which
my
rank
requires
said
lord
dalgarno
repeating
his
last
words
that
now
is
as
good
as
if
my
father
had
spoke
it
i
fancy
you
would
love
to
move
to
court
with
him
followed
by
a
round
score
of
old
with
white
heads
and
red
noses
with
bucklers
and
broadswords
which
their
hands
trembling
betwixt
age
and
strong
waters
can
make
no
use
of
as
many
huge
silver
badges
on
their
arms
to
show
whose
fools
they
are
as
would
furnish
forth
a
court
cupboard
of
plate
rogues
fit
for
nothing
but
to
fill
our
with
the
flavour
of
onions
and
genievre
pah
the
poor
knaves
said
lord
glenvarloch
they
have
served
your
father
it
may
be
in
the
wars
what
would
become
of
them
were
he
to
turn
them
off
why
let
them
go
to
the
hospital
said
dalgarno
or
to
the
to
sell
switches
the
king
is
a
better
man
than
my
father
and
you
see
those
who
have
served
in
his
wars
do
so
every
day
or
when
their
blue
coats
were
well
worn
out
they
would
make
rare
scarecrows
here

a
fellow

stoutest
raven

not

of
that
copper
nose
i
tell
you
there
is
more
service
as
you
will
soon
see
in
my
valet
of
the
chamber
and
such
a
lither
lad
as
my

a

embarrassed

said
the
young
lord
nay
fear
not
me
i
will
be
no
intruder
but
we
have
attained
this
huge
larder
of
flesh
fowl
and
fish
i
marvel
the
oaken
boards
groan
not
under
they
had
indeed
arrived
in
the
of
the
mansion
where
the
table
was
superabundantly
loaded
and
where
the
number
of
attendants
to
a
certain
extent
vindicated
the
sarcasms
of
the
young
nobleman
the
chaplain
and
sir
mungo
malagrowther
were
of
the
party
the
latter
complimented
lord
glenvarloch
upon
the
impression
he
had
made
at
court
one
would
have
thought
ye
had
brought
the
apple
of
discord
in
your
pouch
my
lord
or
that
you
were
the
very
firebrand
of
whilk
althea
was
delivered
and
that
she
had
in
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
for
the
king
and
the
prince
and
the
duke
have
been
by
the
lugs
about
ye
and
so
have
many
more
that
kendna
before
this
blessed
day
that
there
was
such
a
man
living
on
the
face
of
the
mind
your
victuals
sir
mungo
said
the
earl
they
get
cold
while
you
troth
and
that
needsna
my
lord
said
the
knight
your
dinners
seldom
scald
one
mouth
the
are
turning
auld
like
oursells
my
lord
and
it
is
far
between
the
kitchen
and
the
with
this
little
explosion
of
his
spleen
sir
mungo
remained
satisfied
until
the
dishes
were
removed
when
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
brave
new
doublet
of
lord
dalgarno
he
complimented
him
on
his
economy
pretending
to
recognise
it
as
the
same
which
his
father
had
worn
in
edinburgh
in
the
spanish
ambassador
time
lord
dalgarno
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
be
moved
by
any
thing
from
such
a
quarter
proceeded
to
crack
some
nuts
with
great
deliberation
as
he
replied
that
the
doublet
was
in
some
sort
his
father
as
it
was
likely
to
cost
him
fifty
pounds
some
day
soon
sir
mungo
forthwith
proceeded
in
his
own
way
to
convey
this
agreeable
intelligence
to
the
earl
observing
that
his
son
was
a
better
maker
of
bargains
than
his
lordship
for
he
had
bought
a
doublet
as
rich
as
that
his
lordship
wore
when
the
spanish
ambassador
was
at
holyrood
and
it
had
cost
him
but
fifty
pounds
scots
that
was
no
fool
bargain
my
pounds
sterling
if
you
please
sir
mungo
answered
the
earl
calmly
and
a
fool
bargain
it
is
in
all
the
tenses
dalgarno
was
a
fool
when
he
bought
i
be
a
fool
when
i
pay
and
you
sir
mungo
craving
your
pardon
a
fool
for
speaking
of
what
concerns
you
so
saying
the
earl
addressed
himself
to
the
serious
business
of
the
table
and
sent
the
wine
around
with
a
profusion
which
increased
the
hilarity
but
rather
threatened
the
temperance
of
the
company
until
their
joviality
was
interrupted
by
the
annunciation
that
the
scrivener
had
engrossed
such
deeds
as
required
to
be
presently
executed
george
heriot
rose
from
the
table
observing
that
and
legal
documents
were
unseemly
neighbours
the
earl
asked
the
scrivener
if
they
had
laid
a
trencher
and
set
a
cup
for
him
in
the
buttery
and
received
the
respectful
answer
that
heaven
forbid
he
should
be
such
an
ungracious
beast
as
to
eat
or
drink
until
his
lordship
pleasure
was
performed
thou
shalt
eat
before
thou
goest
said
lord
huntinglen
and
i
will
have
thee
try
moreover
whether
a
cup
of
sack
can
not
bring
some
colour
into
these
cheeks
of
thine
it
were
a
shame
to
my
household
thou
shouldst
glide
out
into
the
strand
after
such
a
as
thou
now
wearest
look
to
it
dalgarno
for
the
honour
of
our
roof
is
lord
dalgarno
gave
directions
that
the
man
should
be
attended
to
lord
glenvarloch
and
the
citizen
in
the
meanwhile
signed
and
interchanged
and
thus
closed
a
transaction
of
which
the
principal
party
concerned
understood
little
save
that
it
was
under
the
management
of
a
zealous
and
faithful
friend
who
undertook
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
and
the
estate
released
from
forfeiture
by
payment
of
the
stipulated
sum
for
which
it
stood
pledged
and
that
at
the
term
of
lambmas
and
at
the
hour
of
noon
and
beside
the
tomb
of
the
regent
earl
of
murray
in
the
high
kirk
of
saint
giles
at
edinburgh
being
the
day
and
place
assigned
for
such
redemption
footnote
as
each
covenant
in
those
days
of
accuracy
had
a
special
place
nominated
for
execution
the
tomb
of
the
regent
earl
of
murray
in
saint
giles
church
was
frequently
assigned
for
the
purpose
when
this
business
was
transacted
the
old
earl
would
fain
have
renewed
his
carouse
but
the
citizen
alleging
the
importance
of
the
deeds
he
had
about
him
and
the
business
he
had
to
transact
betimes
the
next
morning
not
only
refused
to
return
to
table
but
carried
with
him
to
his
barge
lord
glenvarloch
who
might
perhaps
have
been
otherwise
found
more
tractable
when
they
were
seated
in
the
boat
and
fairly
once
more
afloat
on
the
river
george
heriot
looked
back
seriously
on
the
mansion
they
had
left
there
live
he
said
the
old
fashion
and
the
new
the
father
is
like
a
noble
old
broadsword
but
harmed
with
rust
from
neglect
and
inactivity
the
son
is
your
modern
rapier
fairly
gilt
and
fashioned
to
the
taste
of
the
time
and
it
is
time
must
evince
if
the
metal
be
as
good
as
the
show
god
grant
it
prove
so
says
an
old
friend
to
the
nothing
of
consequence
passed
betwixt
them
until
lord
glenvarloch
landing
at
paul
wharf
took
leave
of
his
friend
the
citizen
and
retired
to
his
own
apartment
where
his
attendant
richie
not
a
little
elevated
with
the
events
of
the
day
and
with
the
hospitality
of
lord
huntinglen
gave
a
most
splendid
account
of
them
to
the
buxom
dame
nelly
who
rejoiced
to
hear
that
the
sun
at
length
was
shining
upon
what
richie
called
the
right
side
of
the
chapter
xi
you
are
not
for
the
manner
nor
the
times
they
have
their
vices
now
most
like
to
virtues
you
can
not
know
them
apait
by
any
difference
they
wear
the
same
clothes
eat
the
same
meat
sleep
i
the
beds
ride
in
those
coaches
or
very
like
four
horses
in
a
coach
as
the
best
men
and
women
on
the
following
morning
while
nigel
his
breakfast
finished
was
thinking
how
he
should
employ
the
day
there
was
a
little
bustle
upon
the
stairs
which
attracted
his
attention
and
presently
entered
dame
nelly
blushing
like
scarlet
and
scarce
able
to
bring
out
a
young
nobleman
sir
no
one
less
she
added
drawing
her
hand
slightly
over
her
lips
would
be
so
saucy
a
young
nobleman
sir
to
wait
on
you
and
she
was
followed
into
the
little
cabin
by
lord
dalgarno
gay
easy
disembarrassed
and
apparently
as
much
pleased
to
rejoin
his
new
acquaintance
as
if
he
had
found
him
in
the
apartments
of
a
palace
nigel
on
the
contrary
for
youth
is
slave
to
such
circumstances
was
discountenanced
and
mortified
at
being
surprised
by
so
splendid
a
gallant
in
a
chamber
which
at
the
moment
the
elegant
and
cavalier
appeared
in
it
seemed
to
its
inhabitant
yet
lower
narrower
darker
and
meaner
than
it
had
ever
shown
before
he
would
have
made
some
apology
for
the
situation
but
lord
dalgarno
cut
him
short
not
a
word
of
it
he
said
not
a
single
word
i
know
why
you
ride
at
anchor
here
but
i
can
keep
counsel
so
pretty
a
hostess
would
recommend
worse
on
my
word
on
my
honour
said
lord
glenvarloch
nay
nay
make
no
words
of
the
matter
said
lord
dalgarno
i
am
no
nor
shall
i
cross
your
walk
there
is
game
enough
in
the
forest
thank
heaven
and
i
can
strike
a
doe
for
all
this
he
said
in
so
significant
a
manner
and
the
explanation
which
he
had
adopted
seemed
to
put
lord
glenvarloch
gallantry
on
so
respectable
a
footing
that
nigel
ceased
to
try
to
undeceive
him
and
less
ashamed
perhaps
for
such
is
human
weakness
of
supposed
vice
than
of
real
poverty
changed
the
discourse
to
something
else
and
left
poor
dame
nelly
reputation
and
his
own
at
the
mercy
of
the
young
courtier
misconstruction
he
offered
refreshments
with
some
hesitation
lord
dalgarno
had
long
since
breakfasted
but
had
just
come
from
playing
a
set
of
tennis
he
said
and
would
willingly
taste
a
cup
of
the
pretty
hostess
single
beer
this
was
easily
procured
was
drunk
was
commended
and
as
the
hostess
failed
not
to
bring
the
cup
herself
lord
dalgarno
profited
by
the
opportunity
to
take
a
second
and
more
attentive
view
of
her
and
then
gravely
drank
to
her
husband
health
with
an
almost
imperceptible
nod
to
lord
glenvarloch
dame
nelly
was
much
honoured
smoothed
her
apron
down
with
her
hands
and
said
her
john
was
greatly
and
truly
honoured
by
their
lordships
he
was
a
kind
painstaking
man
for
his
family
as
was
in
the
alley
or
indeed
as
far
north
as
paul
she
would
have
proceeded
probably
to
state
the
difference
betwixt
their
ages
as
the
only
alloy
to
their
nuptial
happiness
but
her
lodger
who
had
no
mind
to
be
farther
exposed
to
his
gay
friend
raillery
gave
her
contrary
to
his
wont
a
signal
to
leave
the
room
lord
dalgarno
looked
after
her
and
then
looked
at
glenvarloch
shook
his
head
and
repeated
the
lines
lord
beware
of
jealousy
it
is
the
monster
which
doth
make
the
meat
it
feeds
on
but
come
he
said
changing
his
tone
i
know
not
why
i
should
worry
you
thus
i
who
have
so
many
follies
of
my
own
when
i
should
rather
make
excuse
for
being
here
at
all
and
tell
you
wherefore
i
so
saying
he
reached
a
seat
and
placing
another
for
lord
glenvarloch
in
spite
of
his
anxious
haste
to
anticipate
this
act
of
courtesy
he
proceeded
in
the
same
tone
of
easy
familiarity
we
are
neighbours
my
lord
and
are
just
made
known
to
each
other
now
i
know
enough
of
the
dear
north
to
be
well
aware
that
scottish
neighbours
must
be
either
dear
friends
or
deadly
enemies
must
either
walk
or
stand
to
so
i
choose
the
unless
you
should
reject
my
how
were
it
possible
my
lord
said
lord
glenvarloch
to
refuse
what
is
offered
so
frankly
even
if
your
father
had
not
been
a
second
father
to
me
and
as
he
took
lord
dalgarno
hand
he
added
i
have
i
think
lost
no
time
since
during
one
day
attendance
at
court
i
have
made
a
kind
friend
and
a
powerful
the
friend
thanks
you
replied
lord
dalgarno
for
your
just
opinion
but
my
dear
glenvarloch
or
rather
for
titles
are
too
formal
between
us
of
the
better
file
what
is
your
christian
name
nigel
replied
lord
glenvarloch
then
we
will
be
nigel
and
malcolm
to
each
other
said
his
visitor
and
my
lord
to
the
plebeian
world
around
us
but
i
was
about
to
ask
you
whom
you
suppose
your
enemy
no
less
than
the
favourite
the
great
duke
of
you
dream
what
could
possess
you
with
such
an
opinion
said
dalgarno
he
told
me
so
himself
replied
glenvarloch
and
in
so
doing
dealt
frankly
and
honourably
with
o
you
know
him
not
yet
said
his
companion
the
duke
is
moulded
of
an
hundred
noble
and
fiery
qualities
that
prompt
him
like
a
generous
horse
to
spring
aside
in
impatience
at
the
least
obstacle
to
his
forward
course
but
he
means
not
what
he
says
in
such
passing
heats
i
can
do
more
with
him
i
thank
heaven
than
most
who
are
around
him
you
shall
go
visit
him
with
me
and
you
will
see
how
you
shall
be
i
told
you
my
lord
said
glenvarloch
firmly
and
with
some
haughtiness
the
duke
of
buckingham
without
the
least
offence
declared
himself
my
enemy
in
the
face
of
the
court
and
he
shall
retract
that
aggression
as
publicly
as
it
was
given
ere
i
will
make
the
slightest
advance
towards
you
would
act
becomingly
in
every
other
case
said
lord
dalgarno
but
here
you
are
wrong
in
the
court
horizon
buckingham
is
lord
of
the
ascendant
and
as
he
is
adverse
or
favouring
so
sinks
or
rises
the
fortune
of
a
suitor
the
king
would
bid
you
remember
your
phaedrus
geminas
ripis
cedentibus
ollas
and
so
forth
you
are
the
vase
of
earth
beware
of
knocking
yourself
against
the
vase
of
the
vase
of
earth
said
glenvarloch
will
avoid
the
encounter
by
getting
ashore
out
of
the
current
i
mean
to
go
no
more
to
o
to
court
you
necessarily
must
go
you
will
find
your
scottish
suit
move
ill
without
it
for
there
is
both
patronage
and
favour
necessary
to
enforce
the
you
have
obtained
of
that
we
will
speak
more
hereafter
but
tell
me
in
the
meanwhile
my
dear
nigel
whether
you
did
not
wonder
to
see
me
here
so
early
i
am
surprised
that
you
could
find
me
out
in
this
obscure
corner
said
lord
glenvarloch
my
page
lutin
is
a
very
devil
for
that
sort
of
discovery
replied
lord
dalgarno
i
have
but
to
say
i
would
know
where
he
or
she
dwells
and
he
guides
me
thither
as
if
by
art
i
hope
he
waits
not
now
in
the
street
my
lord
said
nigel
i
will
send
my
servant
to
seek
do
not
concern
yourself
he
is
by
this
time
said
lord
dalgarno
playing
at
and
with
the
most
blackguard
imps
upon
the
wharf
unless
he
hath
foregone
his
old
are
you
not
afraid
said
lord
glenvarloch
that
in
such
company
his
morals
may
become
depraved
let
his
company
look
to
their
own
answered
lord
dalgarno
cooly
for
it
will
be
a
company
of
real
fiends
in
which
lutin
can
not
teach
more
mischief
than
he
can
learn
he
is
i
thank
the
gods
most
thoroughly
versed
in
evil
for
his
years
i
am
spared
the
trouble
of
looking
after
his
moralities
for
nothing
can
make
them
either
better
or
i
wonder
you
can
answer
this
to
his
parents
my
lord
said
nigel
i
wonder
where
i
should
find
his
parents
replied
his
companion
to
render
an
account
to
he
may
be
an
orphan
said
lord
nigel
but
surely
being
a
page
in
your
lordship
family
his
parents
must
be
of
of
as
high
rank
as
the
gallows
could
exalt
them
to
replied
lord
dalgarno
with
the
same
indifference
they
were
both
hanged
i
believe
at
least
the
gipsies
from
whom
i
bought
him
five
years
ago
intimated
as
much
to
you
are
surprised
at
this
now
but
is
it
not
better
that
instead
of
a
lazy
conceited
slip
of
gentility
to
whom
in
your
idea
of
the
matter
i
was
bound
to
stand
sir
pedagogue
and
see
that
he
washed
his
hands
and
face
said
his
prayers
learned
his
acddens
spoke
no
naughty
words
brushed
his
hat
and
wore
his
best
doublet
only
on
sunday
that
instead
of
such
a
jacky
goodchild
i
should
have
something
like
this
he
whistled
shrill
and
clear
and
the
page
he
spoke
of
darted
into
the
room
almost
with
the
effect
of
an
actual
apparition
from
his
height
he
seemed
but
fifteen
but
from
his
face
might
be
two
or
even
three
years
older
very
neatly
made
and
richly
dressed
with
a
thin
bronzed
visage
which
marked
his
gipsy
descent
and
a
pair
of
sparkling
black
eyes
which
seemed
almost
to
pierce
through
those
whom
he
looked
at
there
he
is
said
lord
dalgarno
fit
for
every
element
prompt
to
execute
every
command
good
bad
or
indifferent
unmatched
in
his
tribe
as
rogue
thief
and
all
which
qualities
said
the
undaunted
page
have
each
in
turn
stood
your
lordship
in
out
you
imp
of
satan
said
his
master
my
conjuring
rod
goes
about
your
the
boy
turned
and
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
had
entered
you
see
said
lord
dalgarno
that
in
choosing
my
household
the
best
regard
i
can
pay
to
gentle
blood
is
to
exclude
it
from
my
service
that
very
gallows
bird
were
enough
to
corrupt
a
whole
antechamber
of
pages
though
they
were
descended
from
kings
and
i
can
scarce
think
that
a
nobleman
should
need
the
offices
of
such
an
attendant
as
your
goblin
said
nigel
you
are
but
jesting
with
my
time
will
show
whether
i
jest
or
not
my
dear
nigel
replied
dalgarno
in
the
meantime
i
have
to
propose
to
you
to
take
the
advantage
of
the
to
run
up
the
river
for
pastime
and
at
noon
i
trust
you
will
dine
with
nigel
acquiesced
in
a
plan
which
promised
so
much
amusement
and
his
new
friend
and
he
attended
by
lutin
and
moniplies
who
greatly
resembled
when
thus
associated
the
conjunction
of
a
bear
and
a
monkey
took
possession
of
lord
dalgarno
wherry
which
with
its
badged
watermen
bearing
his
lordship
crest
on
their
arms
lay
in
readiness
to
receive
them
the
air
was
delightful
upon
the
river
and
the
lively
conversation
of
lord
dalgarno
added
zest
to
the
pleasures
of
the
little
voyage
he
could
not
only
give
an
account
of
the
various
public
buildings
and
noblemen
houses
which
they
passed
in
ascending
the
thames
but
knew
how
to
season
his
information
with
abundance
of
anecdote
political
innuendo
and
personal
scandal
if
he
had
not
very
much
wit
he
was
at
least
completely
master
of
the
fashionable
tone
which
in
that
time
as
in
ours
more
than
amply
supplies
any
deficiency
of
the
kind
it
was
a
style
of
conversation
entirely
new
to
his
companion
as
was
the
world
which
lord
dalgarno
opened
to
his
observation
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
nigel
notwithstanding
his
natural
good
sense
and
high
spirit
admitted
more
readily
than
seemed
consistent
with
either
the
tone
of
authoritative
instruction
which
his
new
friend
assumed
towards
him
there
would
indeed
have
been
some
difficulty
in
making
a
stand
to
attempt
a
high
and
stubborn
tone
of
morality
in
answer
to
the
light
strain
of
lord
dalgarno
conversation
which
kept
on
the
frontiers
between
jest
and
earnest
would
have
seemed
pedantic
and
ridiculous
and
every
attempt
which
nigel
made
to
combat
his
companion
propositions
by
reasoning
as
jocose
as
his
own
only
showed
his
inferiority
in
that
gay
species
of
controversy
and
it
must
be
owned
besides
though
internally
disapproving
much
of
what
he
heard
lord
glenvarloch
young
as
he
was
in
society
became
less
alarmed
by
the
language
and
manners
of
his
new
associate
than
in
prudence
he
ought
to
have
been
lord
dalgarno
was
unwilling
to
startle
his
proselyte
by
insisting
upon
any
topic
which
appeared
particularly
to
jar
with
his
habits
or
principles
and
he
blended
his
mirth
and
his
earnest
so
dexterously
that
it
was
impossible
for
nigel
to
discover
how
far
he
was
serious
in
his
propositions
or
how
far
they
flowed
from
a
wild
and
extravagant
spirit
of
raillery
and
ever
and
anon
those
flashes
of
spirit
and
honour
crossed
his
conversation
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
when
stirred
to
action
by
some
adequate
motive
lord
dalgarno
would
prove
something
very
different
from
the
and
voluptuary
which
he
was
pleased
to
represent
as
his
chosen
character
as
they
returned
down
the
river
lord
glenvarloch
remarked
that
the
boat
passed
the
mansion
of
lord
huntinglen
and
noticed
the
circumstance
to
lord
dalgarno
observing
that
he
thought
they
were
to
have
dined
there
surely
no
said
the
young
nobleman
i
have
more
mercy
on
you
than
to
gorge
you
a
second
time
with
raw
beef
and
canary
wine
i
propose
something
better
for
you
i
promise
you
than
such
a
second
scythian
festivity
and
as
for
my
father
he
proposes
to
dine
with
my
grave
ancient
earl
of
northampton
whilome
that
celebrated
of
pretended
prophecies
lord
henry
and
do
you
not
go
with
him
said
his
companion
to
what
purpose
said
lord
dalgarno
to
hear
his
wise
lordship
speak
musty
politics
in
false
latin
which
the
old
fox
always
uses
that
he
may
give
the
learned
majesty
of
england
an
opportunity
of
correcting
his
slips
in
grammar
that
were
a
rare
employment
nay
said
lord
nigel
but
out
of
respect
to
wait
on
my
lord
your
my
lord
my
father
replied
lord
dalgarno
has
enough
to
wait
on
him
and
can
well
dispense
with
such
a
butterfly
as
myself
he
can
lift
the
cup
of
sack
to
his
head
without
my
assistance
and
should
the
said
paternal
head
turn
something
giddy
there
be
men
enough
to
guide
his
right
honourable
lordship
to
his
lordship
right
honourable
now
do
not
stare
at
me
nigel
as
if
my
words
were
to
sink
the
boat
with
us
i
love
my
father
i
love
him
dearly
and
i
respect
him
too
though
i
respect
not
many
things
a
trustier
old
trojan
never
belted
a
broadsword
by
a
loop
of
leather
but
what
then
he
belongs
to
the
old
world
i
to
the
new
he
has
his
follies
i
have
mine
and
the
less
either
of
us
sees
of
the
other
peccadilloes
the
greater
will
be
the
honour
and
respect
that
i
think
is
the
proper
phrase
i
say
the
in
which
we
shall
hold
each
other
being
apart
each
of
us
is
himself
such
as
nature
and
circumstances
have
made
him
but
couple
us
up
too
closely
together
you
will
be
sure
to
have
in
your
leash
either
an
old
hypocrite
or
a
young
one
or
perhaps
both
the
one
and
as
he
spoke
thus
the
boat
put
into
the
at
blackfriars
lord
dalgarno
sprung
ashore
and
flinging
his
cloak
and
rapier
to
his
page
recommended
to
his
companion
to
do
the
like
we
are
coming
among
a
press
of
gallants
he
said
and
if
we
walked
thus
muffled
we
shall
look
like
your
don
who
wraps
him
close
in
his
cloak
to
conceal
the
defects
of
his
i
have
known
many
an
honest
man
do
that
if
it
please
your
lordship
said
richie
moniplies
who
had
been
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
intrude
himself
on
the
conversation
and
probably
remembered
what
had
been
his
own
condition
in
respect
to
cloak
and
doublet
at
a
very
recent
period
lord
dalgarno
stared
at
him
as
if
surprised
at
his
assurance
but
immediately
answered
you
may
have
known
many
things
friend
but
in
the
meanwhile
you
do
not
know
what
principally
concerns
your
master
namely
how
to
carry
his
cloak
so
as
to
show
to
advantage
the
seams
and
the
lining
of
sables
see
how
lutin
holds
the
sword
with
his
cloak
cast
partly
over
it
yet
so
as
to
set
off
the
embossed
hilt
and
the
silver
work
of
the
give
your
familiar
your
sword
nigel
he
continued
addressing
lord
glenvarloch
that
he
may
practise
a
lesson
in
an
art
so
is
it
altogether
prudent
said
nigel
unclasping
his
weapon
and
giving
it
to
richie
to
walk
entirely
unarmed
and
wherefore
not
said
his
companion
you
are
thinking
now
of
auld
reekie
as
my
father
fondly
calls
your
good
scottish
capital
where
there
is
such
bandying
of
private
feuds
and
public
factions
that
a
man
of
any
note
shall
not
cross
your
high
street
twice
without
endangering
his
life
thrice
here
sir
no
brawling
in
the
street
is
permitted
your
citizen
takes
up
the
case
so
soon
as
the
sword
is
drawn
and
clubs
is
the
and
a
hard
word
it
is
said
richie
as
my
kens
at
this
blessed
were
i
your
master
sirrah
said
lord
dalgarno
i
would
make
your
as
you
call
it
boil
over
were
you
to
speak
a
word
in
my
presence
before
you
were
spoken
richie
murmured
some
indistinct
answer
but
took
the
hint
and
ranked
himself
behind
his
master
along
with
lutin
who
failed
not
to
expose
his
new
companion
to
the
ridicule
of
the
by
mimicking
as
often
as
he
could
do
so
unobserved
by
richie
his
stiff
and
upright
stalking
gait
and
discontented
physiognomy
and
tell
me
now
my
dear
malcolm
said
nigel
where
we
are
bending
our
course
and
whether
we
shall
dine
at
an
apartment
of
yours
an
apartment
of
mine
yes
surely
answered
lord
dalgarno
you
shall
dine
at
an
apartment
of
mine
and
an
apartment
of
yours
and
of
twenty
gallants
besides
and
where
the
board
shall
present
better
cheer
better
wine
and
better
attendance
than
if
our
whole
united
exhibitions
went
to
maintain
it
we
are
going
to
the
most
noted
ordinary
of
that
is
in
common
language
an
inn
or
a
tavern
said
nigel
an
inn
or
a
tavern
my
most
green
and
simple
friend
exclaimed
lord
dalgarno
no
no
these
are
places
where
greasy
citizens
take
pipe
and
pot
where
the
knavish
pettifoggers
of
the
law
spunge
on
their
most
unhappy
victims
where
templars
crack
jests
as
empty
as
their
nuts
and
where
small
gentry
imbibe
such
thin
potations
that
they
get
dropsies
instead
of
getting
drunk
an
ordinary
is
a
institution
sacred
to
bacchus
and
comus
where
the
choicest
noble
gallants
of
the
time
meet
with
the
first
and
most
ethereal
wits
of
the
age
where
the
wine
is
the
very
soul
of
the
choicest
grape
refined
as
the
genius
of
the
poet
and
ancient
and
generous
as
the
blood
of
the
nobles
and
then
the
fare
is
something
beyond
your
ordinary
gross
terrestrial
food
sea
and
land
are
ransacked
to
supply
it
and
the
invention
of
six
ingenious
cooks
kept
eternally
upon
the
rack
to
make
their
art
hold
pace
with
and
if
possible
enhance
the
exquisite
quality
of
the
by
all
which
rhapsody
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
can
only
understand
as
i
did
before
that
we
are
going
to
a
choice
tavern
where
we
shall
be
handsomely
entertained
on
paying
probably
as
handsome
a
reckoning
exclaimed
lord
dalgarno
in
the
same
tone
as
before
perish
the
peasantly
phrase
what
profanation
monsieur
le
chevalier
de
beaujeu
pink
of
paris
and
flower
of
gascony
he
who
can
tell
the
age
of
his
wine
by
the
bare
smell
who
distils
his
sauces
in
an
alembic
by
the
aid
of
lully
philosophy
who
carves
with
such
exquisite
precision
that
he
gives
to
noble
knight
and
squire
the
portion
of
the
pheasant
which
exactly
accords
with
his
rank
nay
he
who
shall
divide
a
becafico
into
twelve
parts
with
such
scrupulous
exactness
that
of
twelve
guests
not
one
shall
have
the
advantage
of
the
other
in
a
hair
breadth
or
the
twentieth
part
of
a
drachm
yet
you
talk
of
him
and
of
a
reckoning
in
the
same
breath
why
man
he
is
the
and
general
referee
in
all
matters
affecting
the
mysteries
of
passage
hazard
in
and
in
penneeck
and
verquire
and
what
not
why
beaujeu
is
king
of
the
and
duke
of
the
he
call
a
reckoning
like
a
son
of
the
vulgar
spigot
o
my
dearest
nigel
what
a
word
you
have
spoken
and
of
what
a
person
that
you
know
him
not
is
your
only
apology
for
such
blasphemy
and
yet
i
scarce
hold
it
adequate
for
to
have
been
a
day
in
london
and
not
to
know
beaujeu
is
a
crime
of
its
own
kind
but
you
know
him
this
blessed
moment
and
shall
learn
to
hold
yourself
in
horror
for
the
enormities
you
have
well
but
mark
you
said
nigel
this
worthy
chevalier
keeps
not
all
this
good
cheer
at
his
own
cost
does
he
no
no
answered
lord
dalgarno
there
is
a
sort
of
ceremony
which
my
chevalier
friends
and
intimates
understand
but
with
which
you
have
no
business
at
present
there
is
as
majesty
might
say
a
to
be
disbursed
in
other
words
a
mutual
exchange
of
courtesies
take
place
betwixt
beaujeu
and
his
guests
he
makes
them
a
free
present
of
the
dinner
and
wine
as
often
as
they
choose
to
consult
their
own
felicity
by
frequenting
his
house
at
the
hour
of
noon
and
they
in
gratitude
make
the
chevalier
a
present
of
a
jacobus
then
you
must
know
that
besides
comus
and
bacchus
that
princess
of
sublunary
affairs
the
diva
fortuna
is
frequently
worshipped
at
beaujeu
and
he
as
officiating
hath
as
in
reason
he
should
a
considerable
advantage
from
a
share
of
the
in
other
words
said
lord
glenvarloch
this
man
keeps
a
a
house
in
which
you
may
certainly
game
said
lord
dalgarno
as
you
may
in
your
own
chamber
if
you
have
a
mind
nay
i
remember
old
tom
tally
played
a
hand
at
put
for
a
wager
with
quinze
le
va
the
frenchman
during
morning
prayers
in
paul
the
morning
was
misty
and
the
parson
drowsy
and
the
whole
audience
consisted
of
themselves
and
a
blind
woman
and
so
they
escaped
for
all
this
malcolm
said
the
young
lord
gravely
i
can
not
dine
with
you
at
this
same
and
wherefore
in
the
name
of
heaven
should
you
draw
back
from
your
word
said
lord
dalgarno
i
do
not
retract
my
word
malcolm
but
i
am
bound
by
an
early
promise
to
my
father
never
to
enter
the
doors
of
a
i
tell
you
this
is
none
said
lord
dalgarno
it
is
but
in
plain
terms
an
arranged
on
civiller
terms
and
frequented
by
better
company
than
others
in
this
town
and
if
some
of
them
do
amuse
themselves
with
cards
and
hazard
they
are
men
of
honour
and
who
play
as
such
and
for
no
more
than
they
can
well
afford
to
lose
it
was
not
and
could
not
be
such
houses
that
your
father
desired
you
to
avoid
besides
he
might
as
well
have
made
you
swear
you
would
never
take
accommodation
of
an
inn
tavern
or
place
of
public
reception
of
any
kind
for
there
is
no
such
place
of
public
resort
but
where
your
eyes
may
be
contaminated
by
the
sight
of
a
pack
of
pieces
of
painted
pasteboard
and
your
ears
profaned
by
the
rattle
of
those
little
spotted
cubes
of
ivory
the
difference
is
that
where
we
go
we
may
happen
to
see
persons
of
quality
amusing
themselves
with
a
game
and
in
the
ordinary
houses
you
will
meet
bullies
and
sharpers
who
will
strive
either
to
cheat
or
to
swagger
you
out
of
your
i
am
sure
you
would
not
willingly
lead
me
to
do
what
is
wrong
said
nigel
but
my
father
had
a
horror
for
games
of
chance
religious
i
believe
as
well
as
prudential
he
judged
from
i
know
not
what
circumstance
a
fallacious
one
i
should
hope
that
i
should
have
a
propensity
to
such
courses
and
i
have
told
you
the
promise
which
he
exacted
from
now
by
my
honour
said
dalgarno
what
you
have
said
affords
the
strongest
reason
for
my
insisting
that
you
go
with
me
a
man
who
would
shun
any
danger
should
first
become
acquainted
with
its
real
bearing
and
extent
and
that
in
the
company
of
a
confidential
guide
and
guard
do
you
think
i
myself
game
good
faith
my
father
oaks
grow
too
far
from
london
and
stand
too
fast
rooted
in
the
rocks
of
perthshire
for
me
to
troll
them
down
with
a
die
though
i
have
seen
whole
forests
go
down
like
no
no
these
are
sports
for
the
wealthy
southron
not
for
the
poor
scottish
noble
the
place
is
an
and
as
such
you
and
i
will
use
it
if
others
use
it
to
game
in
it
is
their
fault
but
neither
that
of
the
house
nor
unsatisfied
with
this
reasoning
nigel
still
insisted
upon
the
promise
he
had
given
to
his
father
until
his
companion
appeared
rather
displeased
and
disposed
to
impute
to
him
injurious
and
unhandsome
suspicions
lord
glenvarloch
could
not
stand
this
change
of
tone
he
recollected
that
much
was
due
from
him
to
lord
dalgarno
on
account
of
his
father
ready
and
efficient
friendship
and
something
also
on
account
of
the
frank
manner
in
which
the
young
man
himself
had
offered
him
his
intimacy
he
had
no
reason
to
doubt
his
assurances
that
the
house
where
they
were
about
to
dine
did
not
fall
under
the
description
of
places
which
his
father
prohibition
referred
and
finally
he
was
strong
in
his
own
resolution
to
resist
every
temptation
to
join
in
games
of
chance
he
therefore
pacified
lord
dalgarno
by
intimating
his
willingness
to
go
along
with
him
and
the
of
the
young
courtier
instantaneously
returning
he
again
ran
on
in
a
grotesque
and
rodomontade
account
of
the
host
monsieur
de
beaujeu
which
he
did
not
conclude
until
they
had
reached
the
temple
of
hospitality
over
which
that
eminent
professor
presided

like

the
ordinary
now
an
ignoble
sound
was
in
the
days
of
james
a
new
institution
as
fashionable
among
the
youth
of
that
age
as
the
modern
are
amongst
those
of
the
present
day
it
differed
chiefly
in
being
open
to
all
whom
good
clothes
and
good
assurance
combined
to
introduce
there
the
company
usually
dined
together
at
an
hour
fixed
and
the
manager
of
the
establishment
presided
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
monsieur
le
chevalier
as
he
qualified
himself
saint
priest
de
beaujeu
was
a
sharp
thin
gascon
about
sixty
years
old
banished
from
his
own
country
as
he
said
on
account
of
an
affair
of
honour
in
which
he
had
the
misfortune
to
kill
his
antagonist
though
the
best
swordsman
in
the
south
of
france
his
pretensions
to
quality
were
supported
by
a
feathered
hat
a
long
rapier
and
a
suit
of
embroidered
taffeta
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
in
the
extreme
fashion
of
the
parisian
court
and
fluttering
like
a
maypole
with
many
knots
of
ribbon
of
which
it
was
computed
he
bore
at
least
five
hundred
yards
about
his
person
but
notwithstanding
this
profusion
of
decoration
there
were
many
who
thought
monsieur
le
chevalier
so
admirably
calculated
for
his
present
situation
that
nature
could
never
have
meant
to
place
him
an
inch
above
it
it
was
however
part
of
the
amusement
of
the
place
for
lord
dalgarno
and
other
young
men
of
quality
to
treat
monsieur
de
beaujeu
with
a
great
deal
of
mock
ceremony
which
being
observed
by
the
herd
of
more
ordinary
and
simple
gulls
they
paid
him
in
clumsy
imitation
much
real
deference
the
gascon
natural
forwardness
being
much
enhanced
by
these
circumstances
he
was
often
guilty
of
presuming
beyond
the
limits
of
his
situation
and
of
course
had
sometimes
the
mortification
to
be
disagreeably
driven
back
into
them
when
nigel
entered
the
mansion
of
this
eminent
person
which
had
been
but
of
late
the
residence
of
a
great
baron
of
queen
elizabeth
court
who
had
retired
to
his
manors
in
the
country
on
the
death
of
that
princess
he
was
surprised
at
the
extent
of
the
accommodation
which
it
afforded
and
the
number
of
guests
who
were
already
assembled
feathers
waved
spurs
jingled
lace
and
embroidery
glanced
everywhere
and
at
first
sight
at
least
it
certainly
made
good
lord
dalgarno
encomium
who
represented
the
company
as
composed
almost
entirely
of
youth
of
the
first
quality
a
more
close
review
was
not
quite
so
favourable
several
individuals
might
be
discovered
who
were
not
exactly
at
their
ease
in
the
splendid
dresses
which
they
wore
and
who
therefore
might
be
supposed
not
habitually
familiar
with
such
finery
again
there
were
others
whose
dress
though
on
a
general
view
it
did
not
seem
inferior
to
that
of
the
rest
of
the
company
displayed
on
being
observed
more
closely
some
of
these
petty
expedients
by
which
vanity
endeavours
to
disguise
poverty
nigel
had
very
little
time
to
make
such
observations
for
the
entrance
of
lord
dalgarno
created
an
immediate
bustle
and
sensation
among
the
company
as
his
name
passed
from
one
mouth
to
another
some
stood
forward
to
gaze
others
stood
back
to
make
way
those
of
his
own
rank
hastened
to
welcome
him
those
of
inferior
degree
endeavoured
to
catch
some
point
of
his
gesture
or
of
his
dress
to
be
worn
and
practised
upon
a
future
occasion
as
the
newest
and
most
authentic
fashion
the
the
chevalier
himself
was
not
the
last
to
welcome
this
prime
stay
and
ornament
of
his
establishment
he
came
shuffling
forward
with
a
hundred
apish
and
to
express
his
happiness
at
seeing
lord
dalgarno
i
hope
you
do
bring
back
the
sun
with
you
you
did
carry
away
the
sun
and
moon
from
your
pauvre
chevalier
when
you
leave
him
for
so
long
pardieu
i
believe
you
take
them
away
in
your
that
must
have
been
because
you
left
me
nothing
else
in
them
chevalier
answered
lord
dalgarno
but
monsieur
le
chevalier
i
pray
you
to
know
my
countryman
and
friend
lord
glenvarloch
ah
ha
tres
honore
je
souviens
oui
connu
autrefois
un
milor
kenfarloque
en
ecosse
yes
i
have
memory
of
him
le
pere

were
vera
intimate
when
i
was
at
oly
root
with
monsieur
de
la
motte
i
did
often
play
at
tennis
vit
milor

at

il
etoit

plus
fort
que
moi
ah
le
beaucoup
de

i
have
memory
too
that
he
was
among
the
pretty
girls
ah
un
vrai
diable
dechaine
aha
i
have
memory
better
have
no
more
memory
of
the
late
lord
glenvarloch
said
lord
dalgarno
interrupting
the
chevalier
without
ceremony
who
perceived
that
the
encomium
which
he
was
about
to
pass
on
the
deceased
was
likely
to
be
as
disagreeable
to
the
son
as
it
was
totally
undeserved
by
the
father
who
far
from
being
either
a
gamester
or
libertine
as
the
chevalier
reminiscences
falsely
represented
him
was
on
the
contrary
strict
and
severe
in
his
course
of
life
almost
to
the
extent
of
rigour
you
have
the
reason
milor
answered
the
chevalier
you
have
the
right
ce
que
nous
avons
a
faire
avec
le
temps
passe
the
time
passed
did
belong
to
our
fathers
our
ancetres
very
well
the
time
present
is
to
us
they
have
their
pretty
tombs
with
their
memories
and
armorials
all
in
brass
and
marbre
we
have
the
petits
plats
exquis
and
the
which
i
will
cause
to
mount
up
so
saying
he
made
a
pirouette
on
his
heel
and
put
his
attendants
in
motion
to
place
dinner
on
the
table
dalgarno
laughed
and
observing
his
young
friend
looked
grave
said
to
him
in
a
tone
of
reproach
why
what
you
are
not
gull
enough
to
be
angry
with
such
an
ass
as
that
i
keep
my
anger
i
trust
for
better
purposes
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
i
confess
i
was
moved
to
hear
such
a
fellow
mention
my
name
and
you
too
who
told
me
this
was
no
talked
to
him
of
having
left
it
with
emptied
pshaw
man
said
lord
dalgarno
i
spoke
but
according
to
the
trick
of
the
time
besides
a
man
must
set
a
piece
or
two
sometimes
or
he
would
be
held
a
cullionly
niggard
but
here
comes
dinner
and
we
will
see
whether
you
like
the
chevalier
good
cheer
better
than
his
dinner
was
announced
accordingly
and
the
two
friends
being
seated
in
the
most
honourable
station
at
the
board
were
ceremoniously
attended
to
by
the
chevalier
who
did
the
honours
of
his
table
to
them
and
to
the
other
guests
and
seasoned
the
whole
with
his
agreeable
conversation
the
dinner
was
really
excellent
in
that
piquant
style
of
cookery
which
the
french
had
already
introduced
and
which
the
young
men
of
england
when
they
aspired
to
the
rank
of
connoisseurs
and
persons
of
taste
were
under
the
necessity
of
admiring
the
wine
was
also
of
the
first
quality
and
circulated
in
great
variety
and
no
less
abundance
the
conversation
among
so
many
young
men
was
of
course
light
lively
and
amusing
and
nigel
whose
mind
had
been
long
depressed
by
anxiety
and
misfortune
naturally
found
himself
at
ease
and
his
spirits
raised
and
animated
some
of
the
company
had
real
wit
and
could
use
it
both
politely
and
to
advantage
others
were
coxcombs
and
were
laughed
at
without
discovering
it
and
again
others
were
originals
who
seemed
to
have
no
objection
that
the
company
should
be
amused
with
their
folly
instead
of
their
wit
and
almost
all
the
rest
who
played
any
prominent
part
in
the
conversation
had
either
the
real
tone
of
good
society
which
belonged
to
the
period
or
the
jargon
which
often
passes
current
for
it
in
short
the
company
and
conversation
was
so
agreeable
that
rigour
was
softened
by
it
even
towards
the
master
of
ceremonies
and
he
listened
with
patience
to
various
details
which
the
chevalier
de
beaujeu
seeing
as
he
said
that
milor
taste
lay
for
the
curieux
and
futile
chose
to
address
to
him
in
particular
on
the
subject
of
cookery
to
gratify
at
the
same
time
the
taste
for
antiquity
which
he
somehow
supposed
that
his
new
guest
possessed
he
launched
out
in
commendation
of
the
great
artists
of
former
days
particularly
one
whom
he
had
known
in
his
youth
maitre
de
cuisine
to
the
marechal
strozzi
tres
bon
gentilhomme
pourtant
who
had
maintained
his
table
with
twelve
covers
every
day
during
the
long
and
severe
blockade
of
le
petit
leyth
although
he
had
nothing
better
to
place
on
it
than
the
quarter
of
a
now
and
then
and
the
grass
and
weeds
that
grew
on
the
ramparts
despardieux
un
homme
superbe
with
one
and
a
nettle
or
two
he
could
make
a
soupe
for
twenty
guests
an
haunch
of
a
little
made
a
roti
des
plus
excellens
but
his
coupe
de
maitre
was
when
the
rendition
what
you
call
the
surrender
took
place
and
appened
and
then
dieu
me
damme
he
made
out
of
the
hind
quarter
of
one
salted
horse
couverts
that
the
english
and
scottish
officers
and
nobility
who
had
the
honour
to
dine
with
monseigneur
upon
the
rendition
could
not
tell
what
the
devil
any
of
them
were
made
upon
at
all
the
good
wine
had
by
this
time
gone
so
merrily
round
and
had
such
genial
effect
on
the
guests
that
those
of
the
lower
end
of
the
table
who
had
hitherto
been
listeners
began
not
greatly
to
their
own
credit
or
that
of
the
ordinary
to
make
innovations
you
speak
of
the
siege
of
leith
said
a
tall
man
with
thick
mustaches
turned
up
with
a
military
twist
a
broad
buff
belt
a
long
rapier
and
other
outward
symbols
of
the
honoured
profession
which
lives
by
killing
other
people
you
talk
of
the
siege
of
leith
and
i
have
seen
the
place
a
pretty
kind
of
a
hamlet
it
is
with
a
plain
wall
or
rampart
and
a
or
so
of
a
tower
at
every
angle
uds
daggers
and
scabbards
if
a
leaguer
of
our
days
had
been
hours
not
to
say
so
many
months
before
it
without
carrying
the
place
and
all
its
cocklofts
one
after
another
by
pure
storm
they
would
have
deserved
no
better
grace
than
the
gives
when
his
noose
is
saar
said
the
chevalier
monsieur
le
capitaine
i
vas
not
at
the
siege
of
the
petit
leyth
and
i
know
not
what
you
say
about
the
cockloft
but
i
will
say
for
monseigneur
de
strozzi
that
he
understood
the
grande
guerre
and
was
grand
capitaine
plus
grand
that
is
more
great
it
may
be
than
some
of
the
capitaines
of
angleterre
who
do
speak
very
loud
tenez
monsieur
car
a
vous
o
answered
the
swordsman
we
know
the
frenchman
will
fight
well
behind
his
barrier
of
stone
or
when
he
is
armed
with
back
breast
and
pot
exclaimed
the
chevalier
what
do
you
mean
by
pot
do
you
mean
to
insult
me
among
my
noble
guests
saar
i
have
done
my
duty
as
a
pauvre
gentilhomme
under
the
grand
henri
quatre
both
at
courtrai
and
yvry
and
ventre
saint
gris
we
had
neither
pot
nor
marmite
but
did
always
charge
in
our
which
refutes
another
base
scandal
said
lord
dalgarno
laughing
alleging
that
linen
was
scarce
among
the
french
gentlemen
out
at
arms
and
elbows
both
you
mean
my
lord
said
the
captain
from
the
bottom
of
the
table
craving
your
lordship
pardon
i
do
know
something
of
these
same
we
will
spare
your
knowledge
at
present
captain
and
save
your
modesty
at
the
same
time
the
trouble
of
telling
us
how
that
knowledge
was
acquired
answered
lord
dalgarno
rather
contemptuously
i
need
not
speak
of
it
my
lord
said
the
man
of
war
the
world
knows
it
all
perhaps
but
the
men
of
mohair
the
poor
sneaking
citizens
of
london
who
would
see
a
man
of
valour
eat
his
very
hilts
for
hunger
ere
they
would
draw
a
farthing
from
their
long
purses
to
relieve
them
o
if
a
band
of
the
honest
fellows
i
have
seen
were
once
to
come
near
that
cuckoo
nest
of
theirs
a
cuckoo
nest
that
said
of
the
city
of
london
said
a
gallant
who
sat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
who
wearing
a
splendid
and
fashionable
dress
seemed
yet
scarce
at
home
in
it
i
will
not
brook
to
hear
that
what
said
the
soldier
bending
a
most
terrific
frown
from
a
pair
of
broad
black
eyebrows
handling
the
hilt
of
his
weapon
with
one
hand
and
twirling
with
the
other
his
huge
mustaches
will
you
quarrel
for
your
city
ay
marry
will
i
replied
the
other
i
am
a
citizen
i
care
not
who
knows
it
and
he
who
shall
speak
a
word
in
dispraise
of
the
city
is
an
ass
and
a
peremptory
gull
and
i
will
break
his
pate
to
teach
him
sense
and
the
company
who
probably
had
their
reasons
for
not
valuing
the
captain
courage
at
the
high
rate
which
he
himself
put
upon
it
were
much
entertained
at
the
manner
in
which
the
quarrel
was
taken
up
by
the
indignant
citizen
and
they
exclaimed
on
all
sides
well
run
well
crowed
the
cock
of
saint
paul
sound
a
charge
there
or
the
soldier
will
mistake
his
signals
and
retreat
when
he
should
you
mistake
me
gentlemen
said
the
captain
looking
round
with
an
air
of
dignity
i
will
but
inquire
whether
this
cavaliero
citizen
is
of
rank
and
degree
fitted
to
measure
swords
with
a
man
of
action
for
conceive
me
gentlemen
it
is
not
with
every
one
that
i
can
match
myself
without
loss
of
reputation
and
in
that
case
he
shall
soon
hear
from
me
honourably
by
way
of
you
shall
feel
me
most
dishonourably
in
the
way
of
cudgel
said
the
citizen
starting
up
and
taking
his
sword
which
he
had
laid
in
a
corner
follow
it
is
my
right
to
name
the
place
of
combat
by
all
the
rules
of
the
sword
said
the
captain
and
i
do
nominate
the
maze
in
for
place
two
gentlemen
who
shall
be
indifferent
judges
for
witnesses
and
for
time
let
me
say
this
day
fortnight
at
and
i
said
the
citizen
do
nominate
the
behind
the
house
for
place
the
present
good
company
for
witnesses
and
for
time
the
present
so
saying
he
cast
on
his
beaver
struck
the
soldier
across
the
shoulders
with
his
sheathed
sword
and
ran
down
stairs
the
captain
showed
no
instant
alacrity
to
follow
him
yet
at
last
roused
by
the
laugh
and
sneer
around
him
he
assured
the
company
that
what
he
did
he
would
do
deliberately
and
assuming
his
hat
which
he
put
on
with
the
air
of
ancient
pistol
he
descended
the
stairs
to
the
place
of
combat
where
his
more
prompt
adversary
was
already
stationed
with
his
sword
unsheathed
of
the
company
all
of
whom
seemed
highly
delighted
with
the
approaching
fray
some
ran
to
the
windows
which
overlooked
the
and
others
followed
the
combatants
down
stairs
nigel
could
not
help
asking
dalgarno
whether
he
would
not
interfere
to
prevent
mischief
it
would
be
a
crime
against
the
public
interest
answered
his
friend
there
can
no
mischief
happen
between
two
such
originals
which
will
not
be
a
positive
benefit
to
society
and
particularly
to
the
establishment
as
he
calls
it
i
have
been
as
sick
of
that
buff
belt
and
red
doublet
for
this
month
past
as
i
was
of
aught
and
now
i
hope
this
bold
linendraper
will
cudgel
the
ass
out
of
that
filthy
lion
hide
see
nigel
see
the
gallant
citizen
has
his
ground
about
a
forward
in
the
midst
of
the
alley
the
very
model
of
a
hog
in
armour
behold
how
he
prances
with
his
manly
foot
and
brandishes
his
blade
much
as
if
he
were
about
to
measure
forth
cambric
with
it
see
they
bring
on
the
reluctant
soldado
and
plant
him
opposite
to
his
fiery
antagonist
twelve
paces
still
dividing
them
lo
the
captain
draws
his
tool
but
like
a
good
general
looks
over
his
shoulder
to
secure
his
retreat
in
case
the
worse
come
o
behold
the
valiant
stoops
his
head
confident
doubtless
in
the
civic
helmet
with
which
his
spouse
has
fortified
his
skull
why
this
is
the
rarest
of
sport
by
heaven
he
will
run
a
tilt
at
him
like
a
it
was
even
as
lord
dalgarno
had
anticipated
for
the
citizen
who
seemed
quite
serious
in
his
zeal
for
combat
perceiving
that
the
man
of
war
did
not
advance
towards
him
rushed
onwards
with
as
much
good
fortune
as
courage
beat
down
the
captain
guard
and
pressing
on
thrust
as
it
seemed
his
sword
clear
through
the
body
of
his
antagonist
who
with
a
deep
groan
measured
his
length
on
the
ground
a
score
of
voices
cried
to
the
conqueror
as
he
stood
fixed
in
astonishment
at
his
own
feat
away
away
with
you
fly
fly
fly
by
the
back
door
get
into
the
whitefriars
or
cross
the
water
to
the
bankside
while
we
keep
off
the
mob
and
the
and
the
conqueror
leaving
his
vanquished
foeman
on
the
ground
fled
accordingly
with
all
speed
by
heaven
said
lord
dalgarno
i
could
never
have
believed
that
the
fellow
would
have
stood
to
receive
a
thrust
he
has
certainly
been
arrested
by
positive
terror
and
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
see
they
are
raising
stiff
and
stark
seemed
the
corpse
of
the
swordsman
as
one
or
two
of
the
guests
raised
him
from
the
ground
but
when
they
began
to
open
his
waistcoat
to
search
for
the
wound
which
nowhere
existed
the
man
of
war
collected
his
scattered
spirits
and
conscious
that
the
ordinary
was
no
longer
a
stage
on
which
to
display
his
valour
took
to
his
heels
as
fast
as
he
could
run
pursued
by
the
laughter
and
shouts
of
the
company
by
my
honour
said
lord
dalgarno
he
takes
the
same
course
with
his
conqueror
i
trust
in
heaven
he
will
overtake
him
and
then
the
valiant
citizen
will
suppose
himself
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
him
he
has
despardieux
milor
said
the
chevalier
if
he
had
stayed
one
moment
he
should
have
had
a
what
you
call
a
dishclout
pinned
to
him
for
a
piece
of
shroud
to
show
he
be
de
ghost
of
one
grand
in
the
meanwhile
said
lord
dalgarno
you
will
oblige
us
monsieur
le
chevalier
as
well
as
maintain
your
own
honoured
reputation
by
letting
your
drawers
receive
the
with
a
cudgel
in
case
he
should
venture
to
come
way
ventre
saint
gris
milor
said
the
chevalier
leave
that
to
begar
the
maid
shall
throw
the
upon
the
grand
poltron
when
they
had
laughed
sufficiently
at
this
ludicrous
occurrence
the
party
began
to
divide
themselves
into
little
knots
some
took
possession
of
the
alley
late
the
scene
of
combat
and
put
the
field
to
its
proper
use
of
a
and
it
soon
resounded
with
all
the
terms
of
the
game
as
run
rub
hold
bias
you
infernal
trundling
timber
thus
making
good
the
saying
that
three
things
are
thrown
away
in
a
namely
time
money
and
oaths
in
the
house
many
of
the
gentlemen
betook
themselves
to
cards
or
dice
and
parties
were
formed
at
ombre
at
basset
at
gleek
at
primero
and
other
games
then
in
fashion
while
the
dice
were
used
at
various
games
both
with
and
without
the
tables
as
hazard
passage
and
so
forth
the
play
however
did
not
appear
to
be
extravagantly
deep
it
was
certainly
conducted
with
great
decorum
and
fairness
nor
did
there
appear
any
thing
to
lead
the
young
scotsman
in
the
least
to
doubt
his
companion
assurance
that
the
place
was
frequented
by
men
of
rank
and
quality
and
that
the
recreations
they
adopted
were
conducted
upon
honourable
principles
lord
dalgarno
neither
had
proposed
play
to
his
friend
nor
joined
in
the
amusement
himself
but
sauntered
from
one
table
to
another
remarking
the
luck
of
the
different
players
as
well
as
their
capacity
to
avail
themselves
of
it
and
exchanging
conversation
with
the
highest
and
most
respectable
of
the
guests
at
length
as
if
tired
of
what
in
modern
phrase
would
have
been
termed
lounging
he
suddenly
remembered
that
burbage
was
to
act
shakespeare
king
richard
at
the
fortune
that
afternoon
and
that
he
could
not
give
a
stranger
in
london
like
lord
glenvarloch
a
higher
entertainment
than
to
carry
him
to
that
exhibition
unless
indeed
he
added
in
a
whisper
there
is
paternal
interdiction
of
the
theatre
as
well
as
of
the
i
never
heard
my
father
speak
of
said
lord
glenvarloch
for
they
are
shows
of
a
modern
date
and
unknown
in
scotland
yet
if
what
i
have
heard
to
their
prejudice
be
true
i
doubt
much
whether
he
would
have
approved
of
approved
of
them
exclaimed
lord
dalgarno
why
george
buchanan
wrote
tragedies
and
his
pupil
learned
and
wise
as
himself
goes
to
see
them
so
it
is
next
door
to
treason
to
abstain
and
the
cleverest
men
in
england
write
for
the
stage
and
the
prettiest
women
in
london
resort
to
the
playhouses
and
i
have
a
brace
of
nags
at
the
door
which
will
carry
us
along
the
streets
like
and
the
ride
will
digest
our
venison
and
ortolans
and
dissipate
the
fumes
of

so

grooms
were
in
attendance
with
two
horses
and
the
young
men
mounted
the
proprietor
upon
a
favourite
barb
and
nigel
upon
a
jennet
scarce
less
beautiful
as
they
rode
towards
the
theatre
lord
dalgarno
endeavoured
to
discover
his
friend
opinion
of
the
company
to
which
he
had
introduced
him
and
to
combat
the
exceptions
which
he
might
suppose
him
to
have
taken
and
wherefore
lookest
thou
sad

said
my
pensive
neophyte

thee

stand

against

when
thou
summest
up
like
a
good
arithmetician
the
actions
of
the
day
before
you
balance
the
account
on
your
pillow
tell
the
accusing
spirit
to
his
brimstone
beard
that
if
thine
ears
have
heard
the
clatter
of

all
this
may
be

replied

yet
i
own
i
can
not
think
but
that
your
lordship

other
men
of
good
quality
with

we
dined
might
have
chosen
a
place
of

free

upon

himself
where
seated
among

of

they
had
an
opportunity
of
displaying
their
fair

and
fashionable
manners
while
they
criticised
the

during

forming
at
the

time
a
conspicuous
part
of
the
spectacle
and
an
important
proportion
of
the
audience
nigel
olifaunt
was
too
eagerly
and
deeply
absorbed
in
the
interest
of
the
scene
to
be
capable
of
playing
his
part
as
became
the
place
where
he
was
seated
he
felt
all
the
magic
of
that
sorcerer
who
had
displayed
within
the
paltry
circle
of
a
wooden
booth
the
long
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
compelling
the
heroes
of
either
line
to
stalk
across
the
scene
in
language
and
fashion
as
they
lived
as
if
the

the

the

and

the
tyrant
and

with
such
truth
and
liveliness
that
when
the
battle
of
bosworth
seemed
concluded
by
his
death
the
ideas
of
reality
and
deception
were
strongly
contending
in
lord
glenvarloch
imagination
and
it
required
him
to
rouse
himself
from
his
reverie
so
strange
did
the
proposal
at
first
sound
when
his
companion
declared
king
richard
should
sup
with
them
at
the
mermaid
they
were
joined
at
the
same
time
by
a
small
party
of
the
gentlemen
with
whom
they
had
dined
which
they
recruited
by
inviting
two
or
three
of
the
most
accomplished
wits
and
poets
who
seldom
failed
to
attend
the
fortune
theatre
and
were
even
but
too
ready
to

a
day
of
amusement
with
a
night
of
pleasure

the
whole

adjourned
and
betwixt
fertile
cups
of

excited

the
emulous

seemed
to
realise
the
joyous
boast

of

reminding
the

the
partaker
of
the
festivity
may
have
felt
it
while
passing
over
him
nigel
olifaunt
at
least
did
not
feel
it
so
and
it
required
a
visit
from
his
new
acquaintance
lord
dalgarno
to
reconcile
him
entirely
to
himself
but
this
visit
took
place
early
after
breakfast
and
his
friend
discourse
was
prefaced
with
a
question
how
he
liked
the
company
of
the
preceding
evening
why
excellently
well
said
lord
glenvarloch
only
i
should
have
liked
the
wit
better
had
it
appeared
to
flow
more
freely
every
invention
seemed
on
the
stretch
and
each
extravagant
simile
seemed
to
set
one
half
of
your
men
of
wit
into
a
brown
study
to
produce
something
which
should
and
wherefore
not
said
lord
dalgarno
or
what
are
these
fellows
fit
for
but
to
play
the
intellectual
gladiators
before
us
he
of
them
who
declares
himself
recreant
should
d
n
him
be
restricted
to
muddy
ale
and
the
patronage
of
the
waterman
company
i
promise
you
that
many
a
pretty
fellow
has
been
mortally
wounded
with
a
quibble
or
a
carwitchet
at
the
mermaid
and
sent
from
thence
in
a
pitiable
estate
to
hospital
in
the
vintry
where
they
languish
to
this
day
amongst
fools
and
it
may
be
so
said
lord
nigel
yet
i
could
swear
by
my
honour
that
last
night
i
seemed
to
be
in
company
with
more
than
one
man
whose
genius
and
learning
ought
either
to
have
placed
him
higher
in
our
company
or
to
have
withdrawn
him
altogether
from
a
scene
where
sooth
to
speak
his
part
seemed
unworthily
now
out
upon
your
tender
conscience
said
lord
dalgarno
and
the
fico
for
such
outcasts
of
parnassus
why
these
are
the
very
leavings
of
that
noble
banquet
of
pickled
herrings
and
rhenish
which
lost
london
so
many
of
her
principal
witmongers
and
bards
of
misrule
what
would
you
have
said
had
you
seen
nash
or
green
when
you
interest
yourself
about
the
poor
mimes
you
supped
with
last
night
suffice
it
they
had
their
drench
and
their
doze
and
they
drank
and
slept
as
much
as
may
save
them
from
any
necessity
of
eating
till
evening
when
if
they
are
industrious
they
will
find
patrons
or
players
to
feed
them
footnote
the
condition
of
men
of
wit
and
talents
was
never
more
melancholy
than
about
this
period
their
lives
were
so
irregular
and
their
means
of
living
so
precarious
that
they
were
alternately
rioting
in
debauchery
or
encountering
and
struggling
with
the
meanest
necessities
two
or
three
lost
their
lives
by
a
surfeit
brought
on
by
that
fatal
banquet
of
rhenish
wine
and
pickled
herrings
which
is
familiar
to
those
who
study
the
lighter
literature
of
that
age
the
whole
history
is
a
most
melancholy
picture
of
genius
degraded
at
once
by
its
own
debaucheries
and
the
patronage
of
heartless
rakes
and
profligates
for
the
rest
of
their
wants
they
can
be
at
no
loss
for
cold
water
while
the
new
river
head
holds
good
and
your
doublets
of
parnassus
are
eternal
in
virgil
and
horace
had
more
efficient
patronage
said
nigel
ay
replied
his
countryman
but
these
fellows
are
neither
virgil
nor
horace
besides
we
have
other
spirits
of
another
sort
to
whom
i
will
introduce
you
on
some
early
occasion
our
swan
of
avon
hath
sung
his
last
but
we
have
stout
old

with
as
much
learning
and

as

it
is
not
however
of
him
i
mean
now
to
speak
but
i
come
to
pray
you
of
dear
love
to
row
up
with
me
as
far
as
richmond
where
two
or
three
of
the
gallants
whom
you
saw
yesterday
mean
to
give
music
and
syllabubs
to
a
set
of
beauties
with
some
curious
bright
eyes
among
them
such
i
promise
you
as
might
win
an
astrologer
from
his
worship
of
the
galaxy
my
sister
leads
the
bevy
to
whom
i
desire
to
present
you
she
hath
her
admirers
at
court
and
is
regarded
though
i
might
dispense
with
sounding
her
praise
as
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
there
was
no
refusing
an
engagement
where
the
presence
of
the
party
invited
late
so
low
in
his
own
regard
was
demanded
by
a
lady
of
quality
one
of
the
choice
beauties
of
the
time
lord
glenvarloch
accepted
as
was
inevitable
and
spent
a
lively
day
among
the
gay
and
the
fair
he
was
the
gallant
in
attendance
for
the
day
upon
his
friend
sister
the
beautiful
countess
of
blackchester
who
aimed
at
once
at
superiority
in
the
realms
of
fashion
of
power
and
of
wit
she
was
indeed
considerably
older
than
her
brother
and
had
probably
completed
her
six
lustres
but
the
deficiency
in
extreme
youth
was
more
than
atoned
for
in
the
most
precise
and
curious
accuracy
in
attire
an
early
acquaintance
with
every
foreign
mode
and
a
peculiar
gift
in
adapting
the
knowledge
which
she
acquired
to
her
own
particular
features
and
complexion
at
court
she
knew
as
well
as
any
lady
in
the
circle
the
precise
tone
moral
political
learned
or
jocose
in
which
it
was
proper
to
answer
the
monarch
according
to
his
prevailing
humour
and
was
supposed
to
have
been
very
active
by
her
personal
interest
in
procuring
her
husband
a
high
situation
which
the
gouty
old
viscount
could
never
have
deserved
by
any
merit
of
his
own
commonplace
conduct
and
understanding
it
was
far
more
easy
for
this
lady
than
for
her
brother
to
reconcile
so
young
a
courtier
as
lord
glenvarloch
to
the
customs
and
habits
of
a
sphere
so
new
to
him
in
all
civilised
society
the
females
of
distinguished
rank
and
beauty
give
the
tone
to
manners
and
through
these
even
to
morals
lady
blackchester
had
besides
interest
either
in
the
court
or
over
the
court
for
its
source
could
not
be
well
traced
which
created
friends
and
overawed
those
who
might
have
been
disposed
to
play
the
part
of
enemies
at
one
time
she
was
understood
to
be
closely
leagued
with
the
buckingham
family
with
whom
her
brother
still
maintained
a
great
intimacy
and
although
some
coldness
had
taken
place
betwixt
the
countess
and
the
duchess
of
buckingham
so
that
they
were
little
seen
together
and
the
former
seemed
considerably
to
have
withdrawn
herself
into
privacy
it
was
whispered
that
lady
blackchester
interest
with
the
great
favourite
was
not
diminished
in
consequence
of
her
breach
with
his
lady
our
accounts
of
the
private
court
intrigues
of
that
period
and
of
the
persons
to
whom
they
were
intrusted
are
not
full
enough
to
enable
us
to
pronounce
upon
the
various
reports
which
arose
out
of
the
circumstances
we
have
detailed
it
is
enough
to
say
that
lady
blackchester
possessed
great
influence
on
the
circle
around
her
both
from
her
beauty
her
abilities
and
her
reputed
talents
for
court
intrigue
and
that
nigel
olifaunt
was
not
long
of
experiencing
its
power
as
he
became
a
slave
in
some
degree
to
that
species
of
habit
which
carries
so
many
men
into
a
certain
society
at
a
certain
hour
without
expecting
or
receiving
any
particular
degree
of
gratification
or
even
amusement
his
life
for
several
weeks
may
be
thus
described
the
ordinary
was
no
bad
introduction
to
the
business
of
the
day
and
the
young
lord
quickly
found
that
if
the
society
there
was
not
always
irreproachable
still
it
formed
the
most
convenient
and
agreeable
place
of
meeting
with
the
fashionable
parties
with
whom
he
visited
hyde
park
the
theatres
and
other
places
of
public
resort
or
joined
the
gay
and
glittering
circle
which
lady
blackchester
had
assembled
around
her
neither
did
he
entertain
the
same
scrupulous
horror
which
led
him
originally
even
to
hesitate
entering
into
a
place
where
gaming
was
permitted
but
on
the
contrary
began
to
admit
the
idea
that
as
there
could
be
no
harm
done
in
beholding
such
recreation
when
only
indulged
in
to
a
moderate
degree
so
from
a
parity
of
reasoning
there
could
be
no
objection
to
joining
in
it
always
under
the
same
restrictions
but
the
young
lord
was
a
scotsman
habituated
to
early
reflection
and
totally
unaccustomed
to
any
habit
which
inferred
a
careless
risk
or
profuse
waste
of
money
profusion
was
not
his
natural
vice
or
one
likely
to
be
acquired
in
the
course
of
his
education
and
in
all
probability
while
his
father
anticipated
with
noble
horror
the
idea
of
his
son
approaching
the
he
was
more
startled
at
the
idea
of
his
becoming
a
gaining
than
a
losing
adventurer
the
second
according
to
his
principles
had
a
termination
a
sad
one
indeed
in
the
loss
of
temporal
fortune
the
first
quality
went
on
increasing
the
evil
which
he
dreaded
and
perilled
at
once
both
body
and
soul
however
the
old
lord
might
ground
his
apprehension
it
was
so
far
verified
by
his
son
conduct
that
from
an
observer
of
the
various
games
of
chance
which
he
witnessed
he
came
by
degrees
by
moderate
hazards
and
small
bets
or
wagers
to
take
a
certain
interest
in
them
nor
could
it
be
denied
that
his
rank
and
expectations
entitled
him
to
hazard
a
few
pieces
for
his
game
went
no
deeper
against
persons
who
from
the
readiness
with
which
they
staked
their
money
might
be
supposed
well
able
to
afford
to
lose
it
it
chanced
or
perhaps
according
to
the
common
belief
his
evil
genius
had
so
decreed
that
nigel
adventures
were
remarkably
successful
he
was
temperate
cautious
had
a
strong
memory
and
a
ready
power
of
calculation
was
besides
of
a
daring
and
intrepid
character
one
upon
whom
no
one
that
had
looked
even
slightly
or
spoken
to
though
but
hastily
would
readily
have
ventured
to
practise
any
thing
approaching
to
trick
or
which
required
to
be
supported
by
intimidation
while
lord
glenvarloch
chose
to
play
men
played
with
him
regularly
or
according
to
the
phrase
upon
the
square
and
as
he
found
his
luck
change
or
wished
to
hazard
his
good
fortune
no
farther
the
more
professed
votaries
of
fortune
who
frequented
the
house
of
monsieur
le
chevalier
de
saint
priest
beaujeu
did
not
venture
openly
to
express
their
displeasure
at
his
rising
a
winner
but
when
this
happened
repeatedly
the
gamesters
murmured
amongst
themselves
equally
at
the
caution
and
the
success
of
the
young
scotsman
and
he
became
far
from
being
a
popular
character
among
their
society
it
was
no
slight
inducement
to
the
continuance
of
this
most
evil
habit
when
it
was
once
in
some
degree
acquired
that
it
seemed
to
place
lord
glenvarloch
haughty
as
he
naturally
was
beyond
the
necessity
of
subjecting
himself
to
farther
pecuniary
obligations
which
his
prolonged
residence
in
london
must
otherwise
have
rendered
necessary
he
had
to
solicit
from
the
ministers
certain
forms
of
office
which
were
to
render
his
effectually
useful
and
these
though
they
could
not
be
denied
were
delayed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
lead
nigel
to
believe
there
was
some
secret
opposition
which
occasioned
the
demur
in
his
business
his
own
impulse
was
to
have
appeared
at
court
a
second
time
with
the
king
in
his
pocket
and
to
have
appealed
to
his
majesty
himself
whether
the
delay
of
the
public
officers
ought
to
render
his
royal
generosity
unavailing
but
the
lord
huntinglen
that
good
old
peer
who
had
so
frankly
interfered
in
his
behalf
on
a
former
occasion
and
whom
he
occasionally
visited
greatly
dissuaded
him
from
a
similar
adventure
and
exhorted
him
quietly
to
await
the
deliverance
of
the
ministers
which
should
set
him
free
from
dancing
attendance
in
london
lord
dalgarno
joined
his
father
in
deterring
his
young
friend
from
a
second
attendance
at
court
at
least
till
he
was
reconciled
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
a
matter
in
which
he
said
addressing
his
father
i

offered
my
poor
assistance

being

prevail
on

make
any
not

speak
plainly
the
son
of
sir
george
villiers
to
expect
homage
and
fealty
from
one
more
noble
than
himself
by
eight
quarters
i
heard
him
myself
on
no
reason
that
i
could
perceive
term
lord
nigel
his
enemy
and
it
will
never
be
by
my
counsel
that
the
lad
speaks
soft
word
to
him
till
he
recalls
the
hard
that
is
precisely
my
advice
to
lord
glenvarloch
answered
lord
dalgarno
but
then
you
will
admit
my
dear
father
that
it
would
be
the
risk
of
extremity
for
our
friend
to
return
into
the
presence
the
duke
being
his
enemy
better
to
leave
it
with
me
to
take
off
the
heat
of
the
distemperature
with
which
some
pickthanks
have
persuaded
the
duke
to
regard
our
if
thou
canst
persuade
buckingham
of
his
error
malcolm
said
his
father
for
once
i
will
say
there
hath
been
kindness
and
honesty
in
court
service
i
have
oft
told
your
sister
and
yourself
that
in
the
general
i
esteem
it
as
lightly
as
may
you
need
not
doubt
my
doing
my
best
in
nigel
case
answered
lord
dalgarno
but
you
must
think
my
dear
father
i
must
needs
use
slower
and
gentler
means
than
those
by
which
you
became
a
favourite
twenty
years
by
my
faith
i
am
afraid
thou
wilt
answered
his
i
tell
thee
malcolm
i
would
sooner
wish
myself
in
the
grave
than
doubt
thine
honesty
or
honour
yet
somehow
it
hath
chanced
that
honest
ready
service
hath
not
the
same
acceptance
at
court
which
it
has
in
my
younger
time
and
yet
you
rise
o
the
time
permits
not
your
service
said
lord
dalgarno
we
have
now
no
daily
insurrections
no
nightly
attempts
at
assassination
as
were
the
fashion
in
the
scottish
court
your
prompt
and
uncourteous
attendance
on
the
sovereign
is
no
longer
necessary
and
would
be
as
unbeseeming
as
your
with
their
badges
broadswords
and
bucklers
would
be
at
a
besides
father
loyal
haste
hath
its
inconveniences
i
have
heard
and
from
royal
lips
too
that
when
you
stuck
your
dagger
into
the
traitor
ruthven
it
was
with
such
little
consideration
that
the
point
ran
a
quarter
of
an
inch
into
the
royal
buttock
the
king
never
talks
of
it
but
he
rubs
the
injured
part
and
quotes
his
dolorem
but
this
comes
of
old
fashions
and
of
wearing
a
long
liddesdale
whinger
instead
of
a
poniard
of
parma
yet
this
my
dear
father
you
call
prompt
and
valiant
service
the
king
i
am
told
could
not
sit
upright
for
a
fortnight
though
all
the
cushions
in
falkland
were
placed
in
his
chair
of
state
and
the
provost
of
dunfermline
borrowed
to
the
boot
of
it
is
a
lie
said
the
old
earl
a
false
lie
forge
it
who
list
it
is
true
i
wore
a
dagger
of
service
by
my
side
and
not
a
bodkin
like
yours
to
pick
one
teeth
withal
and
for
prompt
service
odds
nouns
it
should
be
prompt
to
be
useful
when
kings
are
crying
treason
and
murder
with
the
screech
of
a
hen
but
you
young
courtiers
know
nought
of
these
matters
and
are
little
better
than
the
green
geese
they
bring
over
from
the
indies
whose
only
merit
to
their
masters
is
to
repeat
their
own
words
after
them
a
pack
of
mouthers
and
flatterers
and
well
i
am
old
and
unable
to
mend
else
i
would
break
all
off
and
hear
the
tay
once
more
flinging
himself
over
the
campsie
but
there
is
your
father
said
lord
dalgarno
which
if
the
venison
i
sent
you
prove
seasonable
is
at
least
as
sweet
a
follow
me
then
youngsters
if
you
list
said
the
old
earl
and
strode
on
from
the
alcove
in
which
this
conversation
was
held
towards
the
house
followed
by
the
two
young
men
in
their
private
discourse
lord
dalgarno
had
little
trouble
in
dissuading
nigel
from
going
immediately
to
court
while
on
the
other
hand
the
offers
he
made
him
of
a
previous
introduction
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
were
received
by
lord
glenvarloch
with
a
positive
and
contemptuous
refusal
his
friend
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
one
who
claims
the
merit
of
having
given
to
an
obstinate
friend
the
best
counsel
and
desires
to
be
held
free
of
the
consequences
of
his
pertinacity
as
for
the
father
his
table
indeed
and
his
best
liquor
of
which
he
was
more
profuse
than
necessary
were
at
the
command
of
his
young
friend
as
well
as
his
best
advice
and
assistance
in
the
prosecution
of
his
affairs
but
lord
huntinglen
interest
was
more
apparent
than
real
and
the
credit
he
had
acquired
by
his
gallant
defence
of
the
person
was
so
carelessly
managed
by
himself
and
so
easily
eluded
by
the
favourites
and
ministers
of
the
sovereign
that
except
upon
one
or
two
occasions
when
the
king
was
in
some
measure
taken
by
surprise
as
in
the
case
of
lord
glenvarloch
the
royal
bounty
was
never
efficiently
extended
either
to
himself
or
to
his
friends
there
never
was
a
man
said
lord
dalgarno
whose
shrewder
knowledge
of
the
english
court
saw
where
his
father
deficiency
lay
that
had
it
so
perfectly
in
his
power
to
have
made
his
way
to
the
pinnacle
of
fortune
as
my
poor
father
he
had
acquired
a
right
to
build
up
a
staircase
step
by
step
slowly
and
surely
letting
every
boon
which
he
begged
year
after
year
become
in
its
turn
the
for
the
next
annual
grant
but
your
fortunes
shall
not
shipwreck
upon
the
same
coast
nigel
he
would
conclude
if
i
have
fewer
means
of
influence
than
my
father
has
or
rather
had
till
he
threw
them
away
for
butts
of
sack
hawks
hounds
and
such
carrion
i
can
far
better
than
he
improve
that
which
i
possess
and
that
my
dear
nigel
is
all
engaged
in
your
behalf
do
not
be
surprised
or
offended
that
you
now
see
me
less
than
formerly
the
is
commenced
and
the
prince
looks
that
i
should
attend
him
more
frequently
i
must
also
maintain
my
attendance
on
the
duke
that
i
may
have
an
opportunity
of
pleading
your
cause
when
occasion
shall
i
have
no
cause
to
plead
before
the
duke
said
nigel
gravely
i
have
said
so
why
i
meant
the
phrase
no
otherwise
thou
churlish
and
suspicious
disputant
answered
dalgarno
than
as
i
am
now
pleading
the
cause
with
thee
surely
i
only
mean
to
claim
a
share
in
our
royal
master
favourite
benediction
upon
several
occasions
lord
glenvarloch
conversations
both
with
the
old
earl
and
his
son
took
a
similar
turn
and
had
a
like
conclusion
he
sometimes
felt
as
if
betwixt
the
one
and
the
other
not
to
mention
the
more
unseen
and
unboasted
but
scarce
less
certain
influence
of
lady
blackchester
his
affair
simple
as
it
had
become
might
have
been
somehow
accelerated
but
it
was
equally
impossible
to
doubt
the
rough
honesty
of
the
father
and
the
eager
and
officious
friendship
of
lord
dalgarno
nor
was
it
easy
to
suppose
that
the
countenance
of
the
lady
by
whom
he
was
received
with
such
distinction
would
be
wanting
could
it
be
effectual
in
his
service
nigel
was
further
sensible
of
the
truth
of
what
lord
dalgarno
often
pointed
out
that
the
favourite
being
supposed
to
be
his
enemy
every
petty
officer
through
whose
hands
his
affair
must
necessarily
pass
would
desire
to
make
a
merit
of
throwing
obstacles
in
his
way
which
he
could
only
surmount
by
steadiness
and
patience
unless
he
preferred
closing
the
breach
or
as
lord
dalgarno
called
it
making
his
peace
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
nigel
might
and
doubtless
would
have
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
his
friend
george
heriot
upon
this
occasion
having
found
it
so
advantageous
formerly
but
the
only
time
he
saw
him
after
their
visit
to
court
he
found
the
worthy
citizen
engaged
in
hasty
preparations
for
a
journey
to
paris
upon
business
of
great
importance
in
the
way
of
his
profession
and
by
an
especial
commission
from
the
court
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
which
was
likely
to
be
attended
with
considerable
profit
the
good
man
smiled
as
he
named
the
duke
of
buckingham
he
had
been
he
said
pretty
sure
that
his
disgrace
in
that
quarter
would
not
be
of
long
duration
lord
glenvarloch
expressed
himself
rejoiced
at
that
reconciliation
observing
that
it
had
been
a
most
painful
reflection
to
him
that
master
heriot
should
in
his
behalf
have
incurred
the
dislike
and
perhaps
exposed
himself
to
the
ill
offices
of
so
powerful
a
favourite
my
lord
said
heriot
for
your
father
son
i
would
do
much
and
yet
truly
if
i
know
myself
i
would
do
as
much
and
risk
as
much
for
the
sake
of
justice
in
the
case
of
a
much
more
insignificant
person
as
i
have
ventured
for
yours
but
as
we
shall
not
meet
for
some
time
i
must
commit
to
your
own
wisdom
the
farther
prosecution
of
this
and
thus
they
took
a
kind
and
affectionate
leave
of
each
other
there
were
other
changes
in
lord
glenvarloch
situation
which
require
to
be
noticed
his
present
occupations
and
the
habits
of
amusement
which
he
had
acquired
rendered
his
living
so
far
in
the
city
a
considerable
inconvenience
he
may
also
have
become
a
little
ashamed
of
his
cabin
on
paul
wharf
and
desirous
of
being
lodged
somewhat
more
according
to
his
quality
for
this
purpose
he
had
hired
a
small
apartment
near
the
temple
he
was
nevertheless
almost
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
when
he
observed
that
his
removal
appeared
to
give
some
pain
to
john
christie
and
a
great
deal
to
his
cordial
and
officious
landlady
the
former
who
was
grave
and
saturnine
in
every
thing
he
did
only
hoped
that
all
had
been
to
lord
glenvarloch
mind
and
that
he
had
not
left
them
on
account
of
any
unbeseeming
negligence
on
their
part
but
the
tear
twinkled
in
dame
nelly
eye
while
she
recounted
the
various
improvements
she
had
made
in
the
apartment
of
express
purpose
to
render
it
more
convenient
to
his
lordship
there
was
a
great
she
said
had
been
taken
upstairs
to
the
shopman
garret
though
it
left
the
poor
lad
scarce
eighteen
inches
of
opening
to
creep
betwixt
it
and
his
bed
and
heaven
knew
she
did
not
whether
it
could
ever
be
brought
down
that
narrow
stair
again
then
the
turning
the
closet
into
an
alcove
had
cost
a
matter
of
twenty
round
shillings
and
to
be
sure
to
any
other
lodger
but
his
lordship
the
closet
was
more
convenient
there
was
all
the
linen
too
which
she
had
bought
on
purpose
but
heaven
will
be
done
she
was
everybody
likes
marks
of
personal
attachment
and
nigel
whose
heart
really
smote
him
as
if
in
his
rising
fortunes
he
were
disdaining
the
lowly
accommodations
and
the
civilities
of
the
humble
friends
which
had
been
but
lately
actual
favours
failed
not
by
every
assurance
in
his
power
and
by
as
liberal
payment
as
they
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
accept
to
alleviate
the
soreness
of
their
feelings
at
his
departure
and
a
parting
kiss
from
the
fair
lips
of
his
hostess
sealed
his
forgiveness
richie
moniplies
lingered
behind
his
master
to
ask
whether
in
case
of
need
john
christie
could
help
a
canny
scotsman
to
a
passage
back
to
his
own
country
and
receiving
assurance
of
john
interest
to
that
effect
he
said
at
parting
he
would
remind
him
of
his
promise
for

my

not
weary
of
this
london

as
soon
as

dominie
and
his
richie
moniplies
was
as
good
as
his
word
two
or
three
mornings
after
the
young
lord
had
possessed
himself
of
his
new
lodgings
he
appeared
before
nigel
as
he
was
preparing
to
dress
having
left
his
pillow
at
an
hour
much
later
than
had
formerly
been
his
custom
as
nigel
looked
upon
his
attendant
he
observed
there
was
a
gathering
gloom
upon
his
solemn
features
which
expressed
either
additional
importance
or
superadded
discontent
or
a
portion
of
both
how
now
he
said
what
is
the
matter
this
morning
richie
that
you
have
made
your
face
so
like
the
grotesque
mask
on
one
of
the
spouts
yonder
pointing
to
the
temple
church
of
which
gothic
building
they
had
a
view
from
the
window
richie
swivelled
his
head
a
little
to
the
right
with
as
little
alacrity
as
if
he
had
the
crick
in
his
neck
and
instantly
resuming
his
posture
replied
mask
here
mask
there
it
were
nae
such
matters
that
i
have
to
speak
and
what
matters
have
you
to
speak
anent
then
said
his
master
whom
circumstances
had
inured
to
tolerate
a
good
deal
of
freedom
from
his
attendant
my
lord
said
richie
and
then
stopped
to
cough
and
hem
as
if
what
he
had
to
say
stuck
somewhat
in
his
throat
i
guess
the
mystery
said
nigel
you
want
a
little
money
richie
will
five
pieces
serve
the
present
turn
my
lord
said
richie
i
may
it
is
like
want
a
trifle
of
money
and
i
am
glad
at
the
same
time
and
sorry
that
it
is
mair
plenty
with
your
lordship
than
glad
and
sorry
man
said
lord
nigel
why
you
are
reading
riddles
to
me
my
riddle
will
be
briefly
read
said
richie
i
come
to
crave
of
your
lordship
your
commands
for
for
scotland
why
art
thou
mad
man
said
nigel
canst
thou
not
tarry
to
go
down
with
me
i
could
be
of
little
service
said
richie
since
you
purpose
to
hire
another
page
and
why
thou
jealous
ass
said
the
young
lord
will
not
thy
load
of
duty
lie
the
lighter
go
take
thy
breakfast
and
drink
thy
ale
double
strong
to
put
such
absurdities
out
of
thy
head
i
could
be
angry
with
thee
for
thy
folly
man
but
i
remember
how
thou
hast
stuck
to
me
in
adversity
my
lord
should
never
have
parted
us
said
richie
methinks
had
the
warst
come
to
warst
i
could
have
starved
as
gallantly
as
your
lordship
or
more
so
being
in
some
sort
used
to
it
for
though
i
was
bred
at
a
flasher
stall
i
have
not
through
my
life
had
a
constant
intimacy
with
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
trash
said
nigel
or
has
it
no
other
end
than
to
provoke
my
patience
you
know
well
enough
that
had
i
twenty
i
would
hold
the
faithful
follower
that
stood
by
me
in
my
distress
the
most
valued
of
them
all
but
it
is
totally
out
of
reason
to
plague
me
with
your
solemn
my
lord
said
richie
in
declaring
your
trust
in
me
you
have
done
what
is
honourable
to
yourself
if
i
may
with
humility
say
so
much
and
in
no
way
undeserved
on
my
side
nevertheless
we
must
body
of
me
man
why
said
lord
nigel
what
reason
can
there
be
for
it
if
we
are
mutually
satisfied
my
lord
said
richie
moniplies
your
lordship
occupations
are
such
as
i
can
not
own
or
countenance
by
my
how
now
sirrah
said
his
master
angrily
under
favour
my
lord
replied
his
domestic
it
is
unequal
dealing
to
be
equally
offended
by
my
speech
and
by
my
silence
if
you
can
hear
with
patience
the
grounds
of
my
departure
it
may
be
for
aught
i
know
the
better
for
you
here
and
hereafter
if
not
let
me
have
my
license
of
departure
in
silence
and
so
no
more
about
go
to
sir
said
nigel
speak
out
your
mind
only
remember
to
whom
you
speak
weel
weel
my
lord
i
speak
it
with
humility
never
did
richie
look
with
more
starched
dignity
than
when
he
uttered
the
word
but
do
you
think
this
dicing
and
and
haunting
of
taverns
and
playhouses
suits
your
lordship
for
i
am
sure
it
does
not
suit
me
why
you
are
not
turned
precisian
or
puritan
fool
said
lord
glenvarloch
laughing
though
betwixt
resentment
and
shame
it
cost
him
some
trouble
to
do
so
my
lord
replied
the
follower
i
ken
the
purport
of
your
query
i
am
it
may
be
a
little
of
a
precisian
and
i
wish
to
heaven
i
was
mair
worthy
of
the
name
but
let
that
be
a
i
have
stretched
the
duties
of
a
as
far
as
my
northern
conscience
will
permit
i
can
give
my
gude
word
to
my
master
or
to
my
native
country
when
i
am
in
a
foreign
land
even
though
i
should
leave
downright
truth
a
wee
bit
behind
me
ay
and
i
will
take
or
give
a
slash
with
ony
man
that
speaks
to
the
derogation
of
either
but
this
chambering
dicing
and
is
not
my
element
i
can
not
draw
breath
in
it
and
when
i
hear
of
your
lordship
winning
the
siller
that
some
poor
creature
may
full
sairly
miss
by
my
saul
if
it
wad
serve
your
necessity
rather
than
you
gained
it
from
him
i
wad
take
a
jump
over
the
hedge
with
your
lordship
and
cry
to
the
first
grazier
we
met
that
was
coming
from
smithfield
with
the
price
of
his
essex
calves
in
his
leathern
pouch
you
are
a
simpleton
said
nigel
who
felt
however
much
i
never
play
but
for
small
ay
my
lord
replied
the
unyielding
domestic
and
still
with
reverence
it
is
even
sae
much
the
waur
if
you
played
with
your
equals
there
might
be
like
sin
but
there
wad
be
mair
warldly
honour
in
it
your
lordship
kens
or
may
ken
by
experience
of
your
ain
whilk
is
not
as
yet
mony
weeks
auld
that
small
sums
can
ill
be
missed
by
those
that
have
nane
larger
and
i
maun
be
plain
with
you
that
men
notice
it
of
your
lordship
that
ye
play
wi
nane
but
the
misguided
creatures
that
can
but
afford
to
lose
bare
no
man
dare
say
so
replied
nigel
very
angrily
i
play
with
whom
i
please
but
i
will
only
play
for
what
stake
i
that
is
just
what
they
say
my
lord
said
the
unmerciful
richie
whose
natural
love
of
lecturing
as
well
as
his
bluntness
of
feeling
prevented
him
from
having
any
idea
of
the
pain
which
he
was
inflicting
on
his
master
these
are
even
their
own
very
words
it
was
but
yesterday
your
lordship
was
pleased
at
that
same
ordinary
to
win
from
yonder
young
hafflins
gentleman
with
the
crimson
velvet
doublet
and
the
cock
feather
in
his
beaver
him
i
mean
who
fought
with
the
ranting
captain
a
matter
of
five
pounds
or
thereby
i
saw
him
come
through
the
hall
and
if
he
was
not
cleaned
out
of
cross
and
pile
i
never
saw
a
ruined
man
in
my
impossible
said
lord
glenvarloch
why
who
is
he
he
looked
like
a
man
of
all
is
not
gold
that
glistens
my
lord
replied
richie
and
bullion
buttons
make
bare
pouches
and
if
you
ask
who
he
is
maybe
i
have
a
guess
and
care
not
to
at
least
if
i
have
done
any
such
fellow
an
injury
said
the
lord
nigel
let
me
know
how
i
can
repair
never
fash
your
beard
about
that
my
lord
with
reverence
always
said
richie
he
shall
be
suitably
cared
after
think
on
him
but
as
ane
wha
was
running
post
to
the
devil
and
got
a
shouldering
from
your
lordship
to
help
him
on
his
journey
but
i
will
stop
him
if
reason
can
and
so
your
lordship
needs
asks
nae
mair
about
it
for
there
is
no
use
in
your
knowing
it
but
much
the
hark
you
sirrah
said
his
master
i
have
borne
with
you
thus
far
for
certain
reasons
but
abuse
my
no
farther
and
since
you
must
needs
go
why
go
a
god
name
and
here
is
to
pay
your
so
saying
he
put
gold
into
his
hand
which
richie
told
over
piece
by
piece
with
the
utmost
accuracy
is
it
all
right
or
are
they
wanting
in
weight
or
what
the
devil
keeps
you
when
your
hurry
was
so
great
five
minutes
since
said
the
young
lord
now
thoroughly
nettled
at
the
presumptuous
precision
with
which
richie
dealt
forth
his
canons
of
morality
the
tale
of
coin
is
complete
said
richie
with
the
most
imperturbable
gravity
and
for
the
weight
though
they
are
sae
scrupulous
in
this
town
as
make
mouths
at
a
piece
that
is
a
wee
bit
light
or
that
has
been
cracked
within
the
ring
my
sooth
they
will
jump
at
them
in
edinburgh
like
a
cock
at
a
grosart
gold
pieces
are
not
so
plenty
there
the
mair
the
pity
the
more
is
your
folly
then
said
nigel
whose
anger
was
only
momentary
that
leave
the
land
where
there
is
enough
of
my
lord
said
richie
to
be
round
with
you
the
grace
of
god
is
better
than
gold
pieces
when
goblin
as
you
call
yonder
monsieur
lutin
and
you
might
as
well
call
him
gibbet
since
that
is
what
he
is
like
to
end
in
shall
recommend
a
page
to
you
ye
will
hear
little
such
doctrine
as
ye
have
heard
from
and
if
they
were
my
last
words
he
said
raising
his
voice
i
would
say
you
are
misled
and
are
forsaking
the
paths
which
your
honourable
father
trode
in
and
what
is
more
you
are
going
still
under
correction
to
the
devil
with
a
dishclout
for
ye
are
laughed
at
by
them
that
lead
you
into
these
disordered
laughed
at
said
nigel
who
like
others
of
his
age
was
more
sensible
to
ridicule
than
to
reason
who
dares
laugh
at
me
my
lord
as
sure
as
i
live
by
bread
nay
more
as
i
am
a
true
man
and
i
think
your
lordship
never
found
richie
tongue
bearing
aught
but
the
truth
unless
that
your
lordship
credit
my
profit
or
it
may
be
some
sma
occasion
of
my
ain
made
it
unnecessary
to
promulgate
the
haill
veritie
i
say
then
as
i
am
a
true
man
when
i
saw
that
puir
creature
come
through
the
ha
at
that
ordinary
whilk
is
accurst
heaven
forgive
me
for
swearing
of
god
and
man
with
his
teeth
set
and
his
hands
clenched
and
his
bonnet
drawn
over
his
brows
like
a
desperate
man
goblin
said
to
me
goes
a
dunghill
chicken
that
your
master
has
plucked
clean
enough
it
will
be
long
ere
his
lordship
ruffle
a
feather
with
a
cock
of
the
game
and
so
my
lord
to
speak
it
out
the
lackeys
and
the
gallants
and
more
especially
your
sworn
brother
lord
dalgarno
call
you
the
i
had
some
thought
to
have
cracked
lutin
pate
for
the
speech
but
after
a
the
controversy
was
not
worth
do
they
use
such
terms
of
me
said
lord
nigel
death
and
the
devil
and
the
devil
dam
my
lord
answered
richie
they
are
all
three
busy
in
and
besides
lutin
and
his
master
laughed
at
you
my
lord
for
letting
it
be
thought
that
i
shame
to
speak
it
that
ye
were
over
well
with
the
wife
of
the
decent
honest
man
whose
house
you
but
now
left
as
not
sufficient
for
your
new
bravery
whereas
they
said
the
licentious
scoffers
that
you
pretended
to
such
favour
when
you
had
not
courage
enough
for
so
fair
a
quarrel
and
that
the
was
too
to
fly
at
the
wife
of
a
he
stopped
a
moment
and
looked
fixedly
in
his
master
face
which
was
inflamed
with
shame
and
anger
and
then
proceeded
my
lord
i
did
you
justice
in
my
thought
and
myself
too
for
thought
i
he
would
have
been
as
deep
in
that
sort
of
profligacy
as
in
others
if
it
hadna
been
richie
four
what
new
nonsense
have
you
got
to
plague
me
with
said
lord
nigel
but
go
on
since
it
is
the
last
time
i
am
to
be
tormented
with
your
impertinence
go
on
and
make
the
most
of
your
in
troth
said
richie
and
so
will
i
even
do
and
as
heaven
has
bestowed
on
me
a
tongue
to
speak
and
to
advise
which
talent
you
can
by
no
means
be
accused
of
suffering
to
remain
idle
said
lord
glenvarloch
interrupting
him
true
my
lord
said
richie
again
waving
his
hand
as
if
to
bespeak
his
master
silence
and
attention
so
i
trust
you
will
think
some
time
hereafter
and
as
i
am
about
to
leave
your
service
it
is
proper
that
ye
suld
know
the
truth
that
ye
may
consider
the
snares
to
which
your
youth
and
innocence
may
be
exposed
when
aulder
and
doucer
heads
are
withdrawn
from
beside
there
has
been
a
lusty
kimmer
of
some
forty
or
bygane
making
mony
speerings
about
you
my
well
sir
what
did
she
want
with
me
said
lord
nigel
at
first
my
lord
replied
his
sapient
follower
as
she
seemed
to
be
a
woman
and
to
take
pleasure
in
sensible
company
i
was
no
way
reluctant
to
admit
her
to
my
i
dare
say
not
said
lord
nigel
nor
unwilling
to
tell
her
about
my
private
not
i
truly
my
lord
said
the
attendant
for
though
she
asked
me
mony
questions
about
your
fame
your
fortune
your
business
here
and
such
like
i
did
not
think
it
proper
to
tell
her
altogether
the
truth
i
see
no
call
on
you
whatever
said
lord
nigel
to
tell
the
woman
either
truth
or
lies
upon
what
she
had
nothing
to
do
i
thought
so
too
my
lord
replied
richie
and
so
i
told
her
and
what
you
tell
her
then
you
eternal
babbler
said
his
master
impatient
of
his
prate
yet
curious
to
know
what
it
was
all
to
end
in
i
told
her
said
richie
about
your
warldly
fortune
and
sae
forth
something
whilk
is
not
truth
just
at
this
time
but
which
hath
been
truth
formerly
suld
be
truth
now
and
will
be
truth
again
and
that
was
that
you
were
in
possession
of
your
fair
lands
whilk
ye
are
but
in
right
of
as
yet
pleasant
communing
we
had
on
that
and
other
topics
until
she
showed
the
cloven
foot
beginning
to
confer
with
me
about
some
wench
that
she
said
had
a
to
your
lordship
and
fain
she
would
have
spoken
with
you
in
particular
anent
it
but
when
i
heard
of
such
inklings
i
began
to
suspect
she
was
little
better
than
whew
here
he
concluded
his
narrative
with
a
low
but
very
expressive
whistle
and
what
did
your
wisdom
do
in
these
circumstances
said
lord
nigel
who
notwithstanding
his
former
resentment
could
now
scarcely
forbear
laughing
i
put
on
a
look
my
lord
replied
richie
bending
his
solemn
brows
that
suld
give
her
a
heartscald
of
walking
on
such
errands
i
laid
her
enormities
clearly
before
her
and
i
threatened
her
in
sae
mony
words
that
i
would
have
her
to
the
and
she
on
the
contrair
part
miscawed
me
for
a
forward
northern
tyke
and
so
we
parted
never
to
meet
again
as
i
hope
and
trust
and
so
i
stood
between
your
lordship
and
that
temptation
which
might
have
been
worse
than
the
ordinary
or
the
playhouse
either
since
you
wot
well
what
solomon
king
of
the
jews
sayeth
of
the
strange
woman
for
said
i
to
mysell
we
have
taken
to
dicing
already
and
if
we
take
to
drabbing
next
the
lord
kens
what
we
may
land
in
your
impertinence
deserves
correction
but
it
is
the
last
which
for
a
time
at
least
i
shall
have
to
forgive
and
i
forgive
it
said
lord
glenvarloch
and
since
we
are
to
part
richie
i
will
say
no
more
respecting
your
precautions
on
my
account
than
that
i
think
you
might
have
left
me
to
act
according
to
my
own
mickle
better
not
answered
richie
mickle
better
not
we
are
frail
creatures
and
can
judge
better
for
ilk
ither
than
in
our
ain
cases
and
for
me
even
myself
saving
that
case
of
the
sifflication
which
might
have
happened
to
ony
one
i
have
always
observed
myself
to
be
much
more
prudential
in
what
i
have
done
in
your
behalf
than
even
in
what
i
have
been
able
to
transact
for
my
own
interest
whilk
last
i
have
indeed
always
postponed
as
in
duty
i
i
do
believe
thou
hast
said
lord
nigel
having
ever
found
thee
true
and
faithful
and
since
london
pleases
you
so
little
i
will
bid
you
a
short
farewell
and
you
may
go
down
to
edinburgh
until
i
come
thither
myself
when
i
trust
you
will
into
my
now
heaven
bless
you
my
lord
said
richie
moniplies
with
uplifted
eyes
for
that
word
sounds
more
like
grace
than
ony
has
come
out
of
your
mouth
this
i
give
you
my
so
saying
he
thrust
forth
his
immense
bony
hand
seized
on
that
of
lord
glenvarloch
raised
it
to
his
lips
then
turned
short
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
hastily
as
if
afraid
of
showing
more
emotion
than
was
consistent
with
his
ideas
of
decorum
lord
nigel
rather
surprised
at
his
sudden
exit
called
after
him
to
know
whether
he
was
sufficiently
provided
with
money
but
richie
shaking
his
head
without
making
any
other
answer
ran
hastily
down
stairs
shut
the
heavily
behind
him
and
was
presently
seen
striding
along
the
strand
his
master
almost
involuntarily
watched
and
distinguished
the
tall
figure
of
his
late
follower
from
the
window
for
some
time
until
he
was
lost
among
the
crowd
of
passengers
nigel
reflections
were
not
altogether
those
of
it
was
no
good
sign
of
his
course
of
life
he
could
not
help
acknowledging
this
much
to
himself
that
so
faithful
an
adherent
no
longer
seemed
to
feel
the
same
pride
in
his
service
or
attachment
to
his
person
which
he
had
formerly
manifested
neither
could
he
avoid
experiencing
some
twinges
of
conscience
while
he
felt
in
some
degree
the
charges
which
richie
had
preferred
against
him
and
experienced
a
sense
of
shame
and
mortification
arising
from
the
colour
given
by
others
to
that
which
he
himself
would
have
called
his
caution
and
moderation
in
play
he
had
only
the
apology
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
himself
in
this
light
then
his
pride
and
suggested
that
on
the
other
hand
richie
with
all
his
good
intentions
was
little
better
than
a
conceited
pragmatical
domestic
who
seemed
disposed
rather
to
play
the
tutor
than
the
lackey
and
who
out
of
sheer
love
as
he
alleged
to
his
person
assumed
the
privilege
of
interfering
with
and
controlling
his
actions
besides
rendering
him
ridiculous
in
the
gay
world
from
the
antiquated
formality
and
intrusive
presumption
of
his
manners
nigel
eyes
were
scarce
turned
from
the
window
when
his
new
landlord
entering
presented
to
him
a
slip
of
paper
carefully
bound
round
with
a
string
of
and
sealed
had
been
given
in
he
said
by
a
woman
who
did
not
stop
an
instant
the
contents
harped
upon
the
same
string
which
richie
moniplies
had
already
jarred
the
epistle
was
in
the
following
words
for
the
right
honourable
hands
of
lord
glenvarloch
these
from
a
friend
unknown
my
lord
you
are
trusting
to
an
unhonest
friend
and
diminishing
an
honest
reputation
an
unknown
but
real
friend
of
your
lordship
will
speak
in
one
word
what
you
would
not
learn
from
flatterers
in
so
many
days
as
should
suffice
for
your
utter
ruin
he
whom
you
think
most
true
i
say
your
friend
lord
dalgarno
is

with

that
he
resolved
to
dissipate
them
by

in

as

and

promenade
and
for

was
much
frequented
by

classes
lord
glenvarloch
repaired
thither
to
dispel
the
unpleasant
reflections
which
had
been
suggested
by
his
parting
with
his
trusty
squire
richie
moniplies
in
a
manner
which
was
agreeable
neither
to
his
pride
nor
his
feelings
and
by
the
corroboration
which
the
hints
of
his
late
attendant
had
received
from
the
anonymous
letter
mentioned
in
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
there
was
a
considerable
number
of
company
in
the
park
when
he
entered
it
but
his
present
state
of
mind
inducing
him
to
avoid
society
he
kept
aloof
from
the
more
frequented
walks
towards
westminster
and
whitehall
and
drew
to
the
north
or
as
we
should
now
say
the
piccadilly
verge
of
the
enclosure
believing
he
might
there
enjoy
or
rather
combat
his
own
thoughts
unmolested
in
this
however
lord
glenvarloch
was
mistaken
for
as
he
strolled
slowly
along
with
his
arms
folded
in
his
cloak
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
he
was
suddenly
pounced
upon
by
sir
mungo
malagrowther
who
either
shunning
or
shunned
had
retreated
or
had
been
obliged
to
retreat
to
the
same
less
frequented
corner
of
the
park
nigel
started
when
he
heard
the
high
sharp
and
querulous
tones
of
the
knight
cracked
voice
and
was
no
less
alarmed
when
he
beheld
his
tall
thin
figure
hobbling
towards
him
wrapped
in
a
cloak
on
whose
surface
ten
thousand
varied
stains
eclipsed
the
original
scarlet
and
having
his
head
surmounted
with
a
beaver
bearing
a
black
velvet
band
for
a
chain
and
a
capon
feather
for
an
ostrich
plume
lord
glenvarloch
would
fain
have
made
his
escape
but
as
our
motto
intimates
a
leveret
had
as
little
chance
to
free
herself
of
an
experienced
greyhound
sir
mungo
to
continue
the
simile
had
long
ago
learned
to
run
cunning
and
make
sure
of
mouthing
his
game
so
nigel
found
himself
compelled
to
stand
and
answer
the
hackneyed
question
what
news
nothing
extraordinary
i
believe
answered
the
young
nobleman
attempting
to
pass
on
o
ye
are
ganging
to
the
french
ordinary
belive
replied
the
knight
but
it
is
early
day
yet
we
will
take
a
turn
in
the
park
in
the
meanwhile
it
will
sharpen
your
so
saying
he
quietly
slipped
his
arm
under
lord
glenvarloch
in
spite
of
all
the
decent
reluctance
which
his
victim
could
exhibit
by
keeping
his
elbow
close
to
his
side
and
having
fairly
grappled
the
prize
he
proceeded
to
take
it
in
tow
nigel
was
sullen
and
silent
in
hopes
to
shake
off
his
unpleasant
companion
but
sir
mungo
was
determined
that
if
he
did
not
speak
he
should
at
least
hear
ye
are
bound
for
the
ordinary
my
lord
said
the
cynic
weel
ye
canna
do
better
there
is
choice
company
there
and
peculiarly
selected
as
i
am
tauld
being
dootless
sic
as
it
is
desirable
that
young
noblemen
should
herd
withal
and
your
noble
father
wad
have
been
blithe
to
see
you
keeping
such
worshipful
i
believe
said
lord
glenvarloch
thinking
himself
obliged
to
say
something
that
the
society
is
as
good
as
generally
can
be
found
in
such
places
where
the
door
can
scarcely
be
shut
against
those
who
come
to
spend
their
right
my
lord
vera
right
said
his
tormentor
bursting
out
into
a
chuckling
but
most
discordant
laugh
these
citizen
chuffs
and
clowns
will
press
in
amongst
us
when
there
is
but
an
inch
of
a
door
open
and
what
remedy
just
this
that
as
their
cash
gies
them
confidence
we
should
strip
them
of
it
flay
them
my
lord
singe
them
as
the
kitchen
wench
does
the
rats
and
then
they
winna
long
to
come
back
ay
ay
pluck
them
plume
them
and
then
the
larded
capons
will
not
be
for
flying
so
high
a
wing
my
lord
among
the
and
and
the
and
therewithal
sir
mungo
fixed
on
nigel
his
quick
sharp
grey
eye
watching
the
effect
of
his
sarcasm
as
keenly
as
the
surgeon
in
a
delicate
operation
remarks
the
progress
of
his
anatomical
scalpel
nigel
however
willing
to
conceal
his
sensations
could
not
avoid
gratifying
his
tormentor
by
wincing
under
the
operation
he
coloured
with
vexation
and
anger
but
a
quarrel
with
sir
mungo
malagrowther
would
he
felt
be
unutterably
ridiculous
and
he
only
muttered
to
himself
the
words
impertinent
coxcomb
which
on
this
occasion
sir
mungo
imperfection
of
organ
did
not
prevent
him
from
hearing
and
replying
to
ay
ay
vera
true
exclaimed
the
caustic
old
courtier
impertinent
coxcombs
they
are
that
thus
intrude
themselves
on
the
society
of
their
betters
but
your
lordship
kens
how
to
gar
them
as
gude
ye
have
the
trick
they
had
a
braw
sport
in
the
presence
last
friday
how
ye
suld
have
routed
a
young
shopkeeper
horse
and
foot
his
and
a
the
specie
he
had
about
him
down
to
the
very
silver
buttons
of
his
cloak
and
sent
him
to
graze
with
nebuchadnezzar
king
of
babylon
muckle
honour
redounded
to
your
lordship
we
were
tauld
the
loon
threw
himsell
into
the
thames
in
a
fit
of
desperation
there
enow
of
them
behind
there
was
mair
tint
on
you
have
been
told
a
budget
of
lies
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
sir
mungo
said
nigel
speaking
loud
and
sternly
vera
likely
vera
likely
said
the
unabashed
and
undismayed
sir
mungo
naething
but
lies
are
current
in
the
so
the
chield
is
not
drowned
then
the
mair
the
but
i
never
believed
that
part
of
the
story
a
london
dealer
has
mair
wit
in
his
anger
i
dare
swear
the
lad
has
a
bonny
in
his
hand
by
this
time
and
is
scrubbing
the
kennels
in
quest
after
rusty
nails
to
help
him
to
begin
his
pack
he
has
three
bairns
they
say
they
will
help
him
bravely
to
grope
in
the
gutters
your
good
lordship
may
have
the
ruining
of
him
again
my
lord
if
they
have
any
luck
in
this
is
more
than
intolerable
said
nigel
uncertain
whether
to
make
an
angry
vindication
of
his
character
or
to
fling
the
old
tormentor
from
his
arm
but
an
instant
recollection
convinced
him
that
to
do
either
would
only
give
an
air
of
truth
and
consistency
to
the
scandals
which
he
began
to
see
were
affecting
his
character
both
in
the
higher
and
lower
circles
hastily
therefore
he
formed
the
wiser
resolution
to
endure
sir
mungo
studied
impertinence
under
the
hope
of
ascertaining
if
possible
from
what
source
those
reports
arose
which
were
so
prejudicial
to
his
reputation
sir
mungo
in
the
meanwhile
caught
up
as
usual
nigel
last
words
or
rather
the
sound
of
them
and
amplified
and
interpreted
them
in
his
own
way
tolerable
luck
he
repeated
yes
truly
my
lord
i
am
told
that
you
have
tolerable
luck
and
that
ye
ken
weel
how
to
use
that
jilting
quean
dame
fortune
like
a
canny
douce
lad
willing
to
warm
yourself
in
her
smiles
without
exposing
yourself
to
her
frowns
and
that
is
what
i
ca
having
luck
in
a
sir
mungo
malagrowther
said
lord
glenvarloch
turning
towards
him
seriously
have
the
goodness
to
hear
me
for
a
as
weel
as
i
can
my
lord
as
weel
as
i
can
said
sir
mungo
shaking
his
head
and
pointing
the
finger
of
his
left
hand
to
his
ear
i
will
try
to
speak
very
distinctly
said
nigel
arming
himself
with
patience
you
take
me
for
a
noted
gamester
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
have
not
been
rightly
informed
i
am
none
such
you
owe
me
some
explanation
at
least
respecting
the
source
from
which
you
have
derived
such
false
i
never
heard
ye
were
a
gamester
and
never
thought
or
said
ye
were
such
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
who
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
hearing
what
nigel
said
with
peculiarly
deliberate
and
distinct
pronunciation
i
repeat
it
i
never
heard
said
or
thought
that
you
were
a
ruffling
gamester
such
as
they
call
those
of
the
first
look
you
my
lord
i
call
a
gamester
that
plays
with
equal
stakes
and
equal
skill
and
stands
by
the
fortune
of
the
game
good
or
bad
and
i
call
a
ruffling
gamester
or
ane
of
the
first
head
who
ventures
frankly
and
deeply
upon
such
a
wager
but
he
my
lord
who
has
the
patience
and
prudence
never
to
venture
beyond
small
game
such
as
at
most
might
crack
the
of
a
grocer
who
vies
with
those
that
have
little
to
hazard
and
who
therefore
having
the
larger
stock
can
always
rook
them
by
waiting
for
his
good
fortune
and
by
rising
from
the
game
when
luck
leaves
him
such
a
one
as
he
my
lord
i
do
not
call
a
gamester
to
whatever
other
name
he
may
be
and
such
a
sordid
wretch
you
would
infer
that
i
am
replied
lord
glenvarloch
one
who
fears
the
skilful
and
preys
upon
the
ignorant
who
avoids
playing
with
his
equals
that
he
may
make
sure
of
pillaging
his
inferiors
is
this
what
i
am
to
understand
has
been
reported
of
me
nay
my
lord
you
will
gain
nought
by
speaking
big
with
me
said
sir
mungo
who
besides
that
his
sarcastic
humour
was
really
supported
by
a
good
fund
of
animal
courage
had
also
full
reliance
on
the
immunities
which
he
had
derived
from
the
broadsword
of
sir
rullion
rattray
and
the
baton
of
the
satellites
employed
by
the
lady
cockpen
and
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
he
continued
your
lordship
best
knows
whether
you
ever
lost
more
than
five
pieces
at
a
time
since
you
frequented
beaujeu
whether
you
have
not
most
commonly
risen
a
winner
and
whether
the
brave
young
gallants
who
frequent
the
ordinary
i
mean
those
of
noble
rank
and
means
conforming
are
in
use
to
play
upon
those
terms
my
father
was
right
said
lord
glenvarloch
in
the
bitterness
of
his
spirit
and
his
curse
justly
followed
me
when
i
first
entered
that
place
there
is
contamination
in
the
air
and
he
whose
fortune
avoids
ruin
shall
be
blighted
in
his
honour
and
sir
mungo
who
watched
his
victim
with
the
delighted
yet
wary
eye
of
an
experienced
angler
became
now
aware
that
if
he
strained
the
line
on
him
too
tightly
there
was
every
risk
of
his
breaking
hold
in
order
to
give
him
room
therefore
to
play
he
protested
that
lord
glenvarloch
should
not
take
his
free
speech
malam
if
you
were
a
trifle
ower
sicker
in
your
amusement
my
lord
it
canna
be
denied
that
it
is
the
safest
course
to
prevent
farther
endangerment
of
your
somewhat
dilapidated
fortunes
and
if
ye
play
with
your
inferiors
ye
are
relieved
of
the
pain
of
pouching
the
siller
of
your
friends
and
equals
forby
that
the
plebeian
knaves
have
had
the
advantage
as
ajax
telamon
sayeth
and
for
the
like
of
them
to
have
played
with
ane
scottish
nobleman
is
an
honest
and
honourable
consideration
to
compensate
the
loss
of
their
stake
whilk
i
dare
say
moreover
maist
of
the
churls
can
weel
be
that
as
it
may
sir
mungo
said
nigel
i
would
fain
know
ay
ay
interrupted
sir
mungo
and
as
you
say
who
cares
whether
the
fat
bulls
of
bashan
can
spare
it
or
no
gentlemen
are
not
to
limit
their
sport
for
the
like
of
i
wish
to
know
sir
mungo
said
lord
glenvarloch
in
what
company
you
have
learned
these
offensive
particulars
respecting
me
dootless
dootless
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
i
have
ever
heard
and
have
ever
reported
that
your
lordship
kept
the
best
of
company
in
a
private
there
is
the
fine
countess
of
blackchester
but
i
think
she
stirs
not
much
abroad
since
her
affair
with
his
grace
of
buckingham
and
there
is
the
gude
scottish
nobleman
lord
huntinglen
an
undeniable
man
of
quality
it
is
pity
but
he
could
keep
caup
and
can
frae
his
head
whilk
now
and
then
his
reputation
and
there
is
the
gay
young
lord
dalgarno
that
carries
the
craft
of
gray
hairs
under
his
curled
a
fair
race
they
are
father
daughter
and
son
all
of
the
same
honourable
family
i
think
we
needna
speak
of
george
heriot
honest
man
when
we
have
nobility
in
question
so
that
is
the
company
i
have
heard
of
your
keeping
my
lord
those
of
the
my
company
has
not
indeed
been
much
more
extended
than
amongst
those
you
mention
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
in
short
to
court
said
sir
mungo
that
was
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
lord
dalgarno
says
he
can
not
prevail
on
ye
to
come
to
court
and
that
does
ye
prejudice
my
lord
the
king
hears
of
you
by
others
when
he
should
see
you
in
person
i
speak
in
serious
friendship
my
lord
his
majesty
when
you
were
named
in
the
circle
short
while
since
was
heard
to
say
est
alea
glenvarlochides
is
turned
dicer
and
drinker
my
lord
dalgarno
took
your
part
and
he
was
borne
down
by
the
popular
voice
of
the
courtiers
who
spoke
of
you
as
one
who
had
betaken
yourself
to
living
a
town
life
and
risking
your
baron
coronet
amongst
the
flatcaps
of
the
and
this
was
publicly
spoken
of
me
said
nigel
and
in
the
presence
spoken
openly
repeated
sir
mungo
malagrowther
ay
by
my
troth
was
it
that
is
to
say
it
was
whispered
privately
whilk
is
as
open
promulgation
as
the
thing
permitted
for
ye
may
think
the
court
is
not
like
a
place
where
men
are
as
sib
as
simmie
and
his
brother
and
roar
out
their
minds
as
if
they
were
at
an
a
curse
on
the
court
and
the
ordinary
both
cried
nigel
impatiently
with
all
my
heart
said
the
knight
i
have
got
little
by
a
service
in
the
court
and
the
last
time
i
was
at
the
ordinary
i
lost
four
may
i
pray
of
you
sir
mungo
to
let
me
know
said
nigel
the
names
of
those
who
thus
make
free
with
the
character
of
one
who
can
be
but
little
known
to
them
and
who
never
injured
any
of
them
have
i
not
told
you
already
answered
sir
mungo
that
the
king
said
something
to
that
effect
so
did
the
prince
too
and
such
being
the
case
ye
may
take
it
on
your
corporal
oath
that
every
man
in
the
circle
who
was
not
silent
sung
the
same
song
as
they
you
said
but
now
replied
glenvarloch
that
lord
dalgarno
interfered
in
my
in
good
troth
did
he
answered
sir
mungo
with
a
sneer
but
the
young
nobleman
was
soon
borne
down
by
token
he
had
something
of
a
catarrh
and
spoke
as
hoarse
as
a
roopit
raven
poor
gentleman
if
he
had
had
his
full
extent
of
voice
he
would
have
been
as
well
listened
to
dootless
as
in
a
cause
of
his
ain
whilk
no
man
kens
better
how
to
plead
to
and
let
me
ask
you
by
the
way
continued
sir
mungo
whether
lord
dalgarno
has
ever
introduced
your
lordship
to
the
prince
or
the
duke
of
buckingham
either
of
whom
might
soon
carry
through
your
suit
i
have
no
claim
on
the
favour
of
either
the
prince
or
the
duke
of
buckingham
said
lord
as
you
seem
to
have
made
my
affairs
your
study
sir
mungo
although
perhaps
something
unnecessarily
you
may
have
heard
that
i
have
petitioned
my
sovereign
for
payment
of
a
debt
due
to
my
family
i
can
not
doubt
the
king
desire
to
do
justice
nor
can
i
in
decency
employ
the
solicitation
of
his
highness
the
prince
or
his
grace
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
obtain
from
his
majesty
what
either
should
be
granted
me
as
a
right
or
refused
sir
mungo
twisted
his
whimsical
features
into
one
of
his
most
grotesque
sneers
as
he
replied
it
is
a
vera
clear
and
parspicuous
position
of
the
case
my
lord
and
in
relying
thereupon
you
show
an
absolute
and
unimprovable
acquaintance
with
the
king
court
and
mankind
in
whom
have
we
got
here
stand
up
my
lord
and
make
way
by
my
word
of
honour
they
are
the
very
men
we
spoke
of
talk
of
the
devil
and
humph
it
must
be
here
premised
that
during
the
conversation
lord
glenvarloch
perhaps
in
the
hope
of
shaking
himself
free
of
sir
mungo
had
directed
their
walk
towards
the
more
frequented
part
of
the
park
while
the
good
knight
had
stuck
to
him
being
totally
indifferent
which
way
they
went
provided
he
could
keep
his
talons
clutched
upon
his
companion
they
were
still
however
at
some
distance
from
the
livelier
part
of
the
scene
when
sir
mungo
experienced
eye
noticed
the
appearances
which
occasioned
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
to
lord
glenvarloch
a
low
respectful
murmur
arose
among
the
numerous
groups
of
persons
which
occupied
the
lower
part
of
the
park
they
first
clustered
together
with
their
faces
turned
towards
whitehall
then
fell
back
on
either
hand
to
give
place
to
a
splendid
party
of
gallants
who
advancing
from
the
palace
came
onward
through
the
park
all
the
other
company
drawing
off
the
pathway
and
standing
uncovered
as
they
passed
most
of
these
courtly
gallants
were
dressed
in
the
garb
which
the
pencil
of
vandyke
has
made
familiar
even
at
the
distance
of
nearly
two
centuries
and
which
was
just
at
this
period
beginning
to
supersede
the
more
fluttering
and
frivolous
dress
which
had
been
adopted
from
the
french
court
of
henri
quatre
the
whole
train
were
uncovered
excepting
the
prince
of
wales
afterwards
the
most
unfortunate
of
british
monarchs
who
came
onward
having
his
long
curled
auburn
tresses
and
his
countenance
which
even
in
early
youth
bore
a
shade
of
anticipated
melancholy
shaded
by
the
spanish
hat
and
the
single
ostrich
feather
which
drooped
from
it
on
his
right
hand
was
buckingham
whose
commanding
and
at
the
same
time
graceful
deportment
threw
almost
into
shade
the
personal
demeanour
and
majesty
of
the
prince
on
whom
he
attended
the
eye
movements
and
gestures
of
the
great
courtier
were
so
composed
so
regularly
observant
of
all
etiquette
belonging
to
his
situation
as
to
form
a
marked
and
strong
contrast
with
the
forward
gaiety
and
frivolity
by
which
he
recommended
himself
to
the
favour
of
his
dear
dad
and
gossip
king
james
a
singular
fate
attended
this
accomplished
courtier
in
being
at
once
the
reigning
favourite
of
a
father
and
son
so
very
opposite
in
manners
that
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
youthful
prince
he
was
obliged
to
compress
within
the
strictest
limits
of
respectful
observance
the
frolicsome
and
free
humour
which
captivated
his
aged
father
it
is
true
buckingham
well
knew
the
different
dispositions
both
of
james
and
charles
and
had
no
difficulty
in
so
conducting
himself
as
to
maintain
the
highest
post
in
the
favour
of
both
it
has
indeed
been
supposed
as
we
before
hinted
that
the
duke
when
he
had
completely
possessed
himself
of
the
affections
of
charles
retained
his
hold
in
those
of
the
father
only
by
the
tyranny
of
custom
and
that
james
could
he
have
brought
himself
to
form
a
vigorous
resolution
was
in
the
latter
years
of
his
life
especially
not
unlikely
to
have
discarded
buckingham
from
his
counsels
and
favour
but
if
ever
the
king
indeed
meditated
such
a
change
he
was
too
timid
and
too
much
accustomed
to
the
influence
which
the
duke
had
long
exercised
over
him
to
summon
up
resolution
enough
for
effecting
such
a
purpose
and
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
buckingham
though
surviving
the
master
by
whom
he
was
raised
had
the
rare
chance
to
experience
no
wane
of
the
most
splendid
during
two
reigns
until
it
was
at
once
eclipsed
in
his
blood
by
the
dagger
of
his
assassin
felton
to
return
from
this
digression
the
prince
with
his
train
advanced
and
were
near
the
place
where
lord
glenvarloch
and
sir
mungo
had
stood
aside
according
to
form
in
order
to
give
the
prince
passage
and
to
pay
the
usual
marks
of
respect
nigel
could
now
remark
that
lord
dalgarno
walked
close
behind
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
as
he
thought
whispered
something
in
his
ear
as
they
came
onward
at
any
rate
both
the
prince
and
duke
of
buckingham
attention
seemed
to
be
directed
by
such
circumstance
towards
nigel
for
they
turned
their
heads
in
that
direction
and
looked
at
him
attentively
the
prince
with
a
countenance
the
grave
melancholy
expression
of
which
was
blended
with
severity
while
buckingham
looks
evinced
some
degree
of
scornful
triumph
lord
dalgarno
did
not
seem
to
observe
his
friend
perhaps
because
the
sunbeams
fell
from
the
side
of
the
walk
on
which
nigel
stood
obliging
malcolm
to
hold
up
his
hat
to
screen
his
eyes
as
the
prince
passed
lord
glenvarloch
and
sir
mungo
bowed
as
respect
required
and
the
prince
returning
their
obeisance
with
that
grave
ceremony
which
paid
to
every
rank
its
due
but
not
a
tittle
beyond
it
signed
to
sir
mungo
to
come
forward
commencing
an
apology
for
his
lameness
as
he
started
which
he
had
just
completed
as
his
hobbling
gait
brought
him
up
to
the
prince
sir
mungo
lent
an
attentive
and
as
it
seemed
an
intelligent
ear
to
questions
asked
in
a
tone
so
low
that
the
knight
would
certainly
have
been
deaf
to
them
had
they
been
put
to
him
by
any
one
under
the
rank
of
prince
of
wales
after
about
a
conversation
the
prince
bestowed
on
nigel
the
embarrassing
notice
of
another
fixed
look
touched
his
hat
slightly
to
sir
mungo
and
walked
on
it
is
even
as
i
suspected
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
with
an
air
which
he
designed
to
be
melancholy
and
sympathetic
but
which
in
fact
resembled
the
grin
of
an
ape
when
he
has
mouthed
a
scalding
chestnut
ye
have
my
lord
that
is
unfriends
or
to
be
plain
enemies
about
the
person
of
the
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
said
nigel
but
i
would
i
knew
what
they
accuse
me
ye
shall
hear
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
the
prince
vera
words
mungo
said
he
rejoice
to
see
you
and
am
glad
your
rheumatic
troubles
permit
you
to
come
hither
for
exercise
i
bowed
as
in
duty
bound
ye
might
remark
my
lord
that
i
did
so
whilk
formed
the
first
branch
of
our
his
highness
then
demanded
of
me
he
with
whom
i
stood
was
the
young
lord
glenvarloch
i
answered
you
were
such
for
his
highness
service
whilk
was
the
second
thirdly
his
highness
resuming
the
argument
said
that
he
had
been
told
so
meaning
that
he
had
been
told
you
were
that
personage
that
he
could
not
believe
that
the
heir
of
that
noble
and
decayed
house
could
be
leading
an
idle
scandalous
and
precarious
life
in
the
and
taverns
of
london
while
the
drums
were
beating
and
colours
flying
in
germany
in
the
cause
of
the
palatine
his
i
could
your
lordship
is
aware
do
nothing
but
make
an
obeisance
and
a
gracious
ye
sir
mungo
malagrowther
licensed
me
to
fall
back
to
your
lordship
and
now
my
lord
if
your
business
or
pleasure
calls
you
to
the
ordinary
or
anywhere
in
the
direction
of
the
city
why
have
with
you
for
dootless
ye
will
think
ye
have
tarried
lang
enough
in
the
park
as
they
will
likely
turn
at
the
head
of
the
walk
and
return
this
way
and
you
have
a
broad
hint
i
think
not
to
cross
the
prince
presence
in
a
may
stay
or
go
as
you
please
sir
mungo
said
nigel
with
an
expression
of
calm
but
deep
resentment
but
for
my
own
part
my
resolution
is
taken
i
will
quit
this
public
walk
for
pleasure
of
no
man
still
less
will
i
quit
it
like
one
unworthy
to
be
seen
in
places
of
public
resort
i
trust
that
the
prince
and
his
retinue
will
return
this
way
as
you
expect
for
i
will
abide
sir
mungo
and
beard
beard
them
exclaimed
sir
mungo
in
the
extremity
of
surprise
beard
the
prince
of
wales
the
of
the
kingdoms
by
my
saul
you
shall
beard
him
yourself
accordingly
he
was
about
to
leave
nigel
very
hastily
when
some
unwonted
touch
of
interest
in
his
youth
and
experience
seemed
suddenly
to
soften
his
habitual
cynicism
the
devil
is
in
me
for
an
auld
fule
said
sir
mungo
but
i
must
needs
concern
mysell
i
that
owe
so
little
either
to
fortune
or
my
must
i
say
needs
concern
mysell
with
this
springald
whom
i
will
warrant
to
be
as
obstinate
as
a
pig
possessed
with
a
devil
for
it
the
cast
of
his
family
and
yet
i
maun
fling
away
some
sound
advice
on
my
dainty
young
lord
glenvarloch
understand
me
distinctly
for
this
is
no
when
the
prince
said
sae
much
to
me
as
i
have
repeated
to
you
it
was
equivalent
to
a
command
not
to
appear
in
his
presence
wherefore
take
an
auld
advice
that
wishes
you
weel
and
maybe
a
wee
thing
better
than
he
has
reason
to
wish
ony
body
jouk
and
let
the
jaw
gae
by
like
a
canny
bairn
gang
hame
to
your
lodgings
keep
your
foot
frae
taverns
and
your
fingers
frae
the
compound
your
affairs
quietly
wi
some
ane
that
has
better
favour
than
yours
about
court
and
you
will
get
a
round
spell
of
money
to
carry
you
to
germany
or
elsewhere
to
push
your
fortune
it
was
a
fortunate
soldier
that
made
your
family
four
or
five
hundred
years
syne
and
if
you
are
brave
and
fortunate
you
may
find
the
way
to
repair
it
but
take
my
word
for
it
that
in
this
court
you
will
never
when
sir
mungo
had
completed
his
exhortation
in
which
there
was
more
of
sincere
sympathy
with
another
situation
than
he
had
been
heretofore
known
to
express
in
behalf
of
any
one
lord
glenvarloch
replied
i
am
obliged
to
you
sir
mungo
you
have
spoken
i
think
with
sincerity
and
i
thank
you
but
in
return
for
your
good
advice
i
heartily
entreat
you
to
leave
me
i
observe
the
prince
and
his
train
are
returning
down
the
walk
and
you
may
prejudice
yourself
but
can
not
help
me
by
remaining
with
and
that
is
true
said
sir
mungo
yet
were
i
ten
years
younger
i
would
be
tempted
to
stand
by
you
and
gie
them
the
meeting
but
at
threescore
and
upward
men
courage
turns
cauldrife
and
they
that
canna
win
a
living
must
not
endanger
the
small
sustenance
of
their
age
i
wish
you
weel
through
my
lord
but
it
is
an
unequal
so
saying
he
turned
and
limped
away
often
looking
back
however
as
if
his
natural
spirit
even
in
its
present
subdued
state
aided
by
his
love
of
contradiction
and
of
debate
rendered
him
unwilling
to
adopt
the
course
necessary
for
his
own
security
thus
abandoned
by
his
companion
whose
departure
he
graced
with
better
thoughts
of
him
than
those
which
he
bestowed
on
his
appearance
nigel
remained
with
his
arms
folded
and
reclining
against
a
solitary
tree
which
overhung
the
path
making
up
his
mind
to
encounter
a
moment
which
he
expected
to
be
critical
of
his
fate
but
he
was
mistaken
in
supposing
that
the
prince
of
wales
would
either
address
him
or
admit
him
to
expostulation
in
such
a
public
place
as
the
park
he
did
not
remain
unnoticed
however
for
when
he
made
a
respectful
but
haughty
obeisance
intimating
in
look
and
manner
that
he
was
possessed
of
and
undaunted
by
the
unfavourable
opinion
which
the
prince
had
so
lately
expressed
charles
returned
his
reverence
with
such
a
frown
as
is
only
given
by
those
whose
frown
is
authority
and
decision
the
train
passed
on
the
duke
of
buckingham
not
even
appearing
to
see
lord
glenvarloch
while
lord
dalgarno
though
no
longer
incommoded
by
the
sunbeams
kept
his
eyes
which
had
perhaps
been
dazzled
by
their
former
splendour
bent
upon
the
ground
lord
glenvarloch
had
difficulty
to
restrain
an
indignation
to
which
in
the
circumstances
it
would
have
been
madness
to
have
given
vent
he
started
from
his
reclining
posture
and
followed
the
prince
train
so
as
to
keep
them
distinctly
in
sight
which
was
very
easy
as
they
walked
slowly
nigel
observed
them
keep
their
road
towards
the
palace
where
the
prince
turned
at
the
gate
and
bowed
to
the
noblemen
in
attendance
in
token
of
dismissing
them
and
entered
the
palace
accompanied
only
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
one
or
two
of
his
equerries
the
rest
of
the
train
having
returned
in
all
dutiful
humility
the
farewell
of
the
prince
began
to
disperse
themselves
through
the
park
all
this
was
carefully
noticed
by
lord
glenvarloch
who
as
he
adjusted
his
cloak
and
drew
his
round
so
as
to
bring
the
hilt
closer
to
his
hand
muttered
dalgarno
shall
explain
all
this
to
me
for
it
is
evident
that
he
is
in
the
secret
chapter
xvi
give
way
give
way
i
must
and
will
have
justice
and
tell
me
not
of
privilege
and
place
where
i
am
injured
there
i
sue
redress
look
to
it
every
one
who
bars
my
access
i
have
a
heart
to
feel
the
injury
a
hand
to
night
myself
and
by
my
honour
that
hand
shall
grasp
what
law
denies
me
it
was
not
long
ere
nigel
discovered
lord
dalgarno
advancing
towards
him
in
the
company
of
another
young
man
of
quality
of
the
prince
train
and
as
they
directed
their
course
towards
the
corner
of
the
park
he
concluded
they
were
about
to
go
to
lord
huntinglen
they
stopped
however
and
turned
up
another
path
leading
to
the
north
and
lord
glenvarloch
conceived
that
this
change
of
direction
was
owing
to
their
having
seen
him
and
their
desire
to
avoid
him
nigel
followed
them
without
hesitation
by
a
path
which
winding
around
a
thicket
of
shrubs
and
trees
once
more
conducted
him
to
the
less
frequented
part
of
the
park
he
observed
which
side
of
the
thicket
was
taken
by
lord
dalgarno
and
his
companion
and
he
himself
walking
hastily
round
the
other
verge
was
thus
enabled
to
meet
them
face
to
face
my
lord
dalgarno
said
lord
glenvarloch
sternly
ha
my
friend
nigel
answered
lord
dalgarno
in
his
usual
careless
and
indifferent
tone
my
friend
nigel
with
business
on
his
brow
but
you
must
wait
till
we
meet
at
beaujeu
at
noon
sir
ewes
haldimund
and
i
are
at
present
engaged
in
the
prince
if
you
were
engaged
in
the
king
my
lord
said
lord
glenvarloch
you
must
stand
and
answer
said
lord
dalgarno
with
an
air
of
great
astonishment
what
passion
is
this
why
nigel
this
is
king
cambyses
vein
you
have
frequented
the
theatres
too
much
lately
away
with
this
folly
man
go
dine
upon
soup
and
salad
drink
to
cool
your
blood
go
to
bed
at
and
defy
those
foul
fiends
wrath
and
i
have
had
misconstruction
enough
among
you
said
glenvarloch
in
the
same
tone
of
determined
displeasure
and
from
you
my
lord
dalgarno
in
particular
and
all
under
the
mask
of
here
is
a
proper
business
said
dalgarno
turning
as
if
to
appeal
to
sir
ewes
haldimund
do
you
see
this
angry
ruffler
sir
ewes
a
month
since
he
dared
not
have
looked
one
of
yonder
sheep
in
the
face
and
now
he
is
a
prince
of
roisterers
a
plucker
of
pigeons
a
controller
of
players
and
poets
and
in
gratitude
for
my
having
shown
him
the
way
to
the
eminent
character
which
he
holds
upon
town
he
comes
hither
to
quarrel
with
his
best
friend
if
not
his
only
one
of
decent
i
renounce
such
hollow
friendship
my
lord
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
disclaim
the
character
which
even
to
my
very
face
you
labour
to
fix
upon
me
and
ere
we
part
i
will
call
you
to
a
reckoning
for
my
lords
both
interrupted
sir
ewes
haldimund
let
me
remind
you
that
the
royal
park
is
no
place
to
quarrel
i
will
make
my
quarrel
good
said
nigel
who
did
not
know
or
in
his
passion
might
not
have
recollected
the
privileges
of
the
place
wherever
i
find
my
you
shall
find
quarelling
enough
replied
lord
dalgarno
calmly
so
soon
as
you
assign
a
sufficient
cause
for
it
sir
ewes
haldimund
who
knows
the
court
will
warrant
you
that
i
am
not
backward
on
such
but
of
what
is
it
that
you
now
complain
after
having
experienced
nothing
save
kindness
from
me
and
my
family
of
your
family
i
complain
not
replied
lord
glenvarloch
they
have
done
for
me
all
they
could
more
far
more
than
i
could
have
expected
but
you
my
lord
have
suffered
me
while
you
called
me
your
friend
to
be
traduced
where
a
word
of
your
mouth
would
have
placed
my
character
in
its
true
colours
and
hence
the
injurious
message
which
i
just
now
received
from
the
prince
of
wales
to
permit
the
misrepresentation
of
a
friend
my
lord
is
to
share
in
the
you
have
been
misinformed
my
lord
glenvarloch
said
sir
ewes
haldimund
i
have
myself
often
heard
lord
dalgarno
defend
your
character
and
regret
that
your
exclusive
attachment
to
the
pleasures
of
a
london
life
prevented
your
paying
your
duty
regularly
to
the
king
and
while
he
himself
said
lord
glenvarloch
dissuaded
me
from
presenting
myself
at
i
will
cut
this
matter
short
said
lord
dalgarno
with
haughty
coldness
you
seem
to
have
conceived
my
lord
that
you
and
i
were
pylades
and
orestes
a
second
edition
of
damon
and
pythias
theseus
and
pirithoiis
at
the
least
you
are
mistaken
and
have
given
the
name
of
friendship
to
what
on
my
part
was
mere
and
compassion
for
a
raw
and
ignorant
countryman
joined
to
the
cumbersome
charge
which
my
father
gave
me
respecting
you
your
character
my
lord
is
of
no
drawing
but
of
your
own
making
i
introduced
you
where
as
in
all
such
places
there
was
good
and
indifferent
company
to
be
met
with
your
habits
or
taste
made
you
prefer
the
worse
your
holy
horror
at
the
sight
of
dice
and
cards
degenerated
into
the
cautious
resolution
to
play
only
at
those
times
and
with
such
persons
as
might
ensure
your
rising
a
winner
no
man
can
long
do
so
and
continue
to
be
held
a
gentleman
such
is
the
reputation
you
have
made
for
yourself
and
you
have
no
right
to
be
angry
that
i
do
not
contradict
in
society
what
yourself
know
to
be
true
let
us
pass
on
my
lord
and
if
you
want
further
explanation
seek
some
other
time
and
fitter
no
time
can
be
better
than
the
present
said
lord
glenvarloch
whose
resentment
was
now
excited
to
the
uttermost
by
the
and
insulting
manner
in
which
dalgarno
vindicated
himself
no
place
fitter
than
the
place
where
we
now
stand
those
of
my
house
have
ever
avenged
insult
at
the
moment
and
on
the
spot
where
it
was
offered
were
it
at
the
foot
of
the
lord
dalgarno
you
are
a
villain
draw
and
defend
at
the
same
moment
he
unsheathed
his
rapier
are
you
mad
said
lord
dalgarno
stepping
back
we
are
in
the
precincts
of
the
the
better
answered
lord
glenvarloch
i
will
cleanse
them
from
a
calumniator
and
a
he
then
pressed
on
lord
dalgarno
and
struck
him
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
the
fray
had
now
attracted
attention
and
the
cry
went
round
keep
the
peace
keep
the
peace
swords
drawn
in
the
park
what
ho
guards
keepers
yeomen
rangers
and
a
number
of
people
came
rushing
to
the
spot
from
all
sides
lord
dalgarno
who
had
half
drawn
his
sword
on
receiving
the
blow
returned
it
to
his
scabbard
when
he
observed
the
crowd
thicken
and
taking
sir
ewes
haldimund
by
the
arm
walked
hastily
away
only
saying
to
lord
glenvarloch
as
they
left
him
you
shall
dearly
abye
this
insult
we
will
meet
a
elderly
man
who
observed
that
lord
glenvarloch
remained
on
the
spot
taking
compassion
on
his
youthful
appearance
said
to
him
are
you
aware
that
this
is
a
business
young
gentleman
and
that
it
may
cost
you
your
right
hand
shift
for
yourself
before
the
keepers
or
constables
come
up
get
into
whitefriars
or
somewhere
for
sanctuary
and
concealment
till
you
can
make
friends
or
quit
the
the
advice
was
not
to
be
neglected
lord
glenvarloch
made
hastily
towards
the
issue
from
the
park
by
saint
james
palace
then
saint
james
hospital
the
hubbub
increased
behind
him
and
several
of
the
royal
household
came
up
to
apprehend
the
delinquent
fortunately
for
nigel
a
popular
edition
of
the
cause
of
the
affray
had
gone
abroad
it
was
said
that
one
of
the
duke
of
companions
had
insulted
a
stranger
gentleman
from
the
country
and
that
the
stranger
had
cudgelled
him
soundly
a
favourite
or
the
companion
of
a
favourite
is
always
odious
to
john
bull
who
has
besides
a
partiality
to
those
disputants
who
proceed
as
lawyers
term
it
wye
du
and
both
prejudices
were
in
nigel
favour
the
officers
therefore
who
came
to
apprehend
him
could
learn
from
the
spectators
no
particulars
of
his
appearance
or
information
concerning
the
road
he
had
taken
so
that
for
the
moment
he
escaped
being
arrested
what
lord
glenvarloch
heard
among
the
crowd
as
he
passed
along
was
sufficient
to
satisfy
him
that
in
his
impatient
passion
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
predicament
of
considerable
danger
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
severe
and
arbitrary
proceedings
of
the
court
of
especially
in
cases
of
breach
of
privilege
which
made
it
the
terror
of
all
men
and
it
was
no
farther
back
than
the
queen
time
that
the
punishment
of
mutilation
had
been
actually
awarded
and
executed
for
some
offence
of
the
same
kind
which
he
had
just
committed
he
had
also
the
comfortable
reflection
that
by
his
violent
quarrel
with
lord
dalgarno
he
must
now
forfeit
the
friendship
and
good
offices
of
that
nobleman
father
and
sister
almost
the
only
persons
of
consideration
in
whom
he
could
claim
any
interest
while
all
the
evil
reports
which
had
been
put
in
circulation
concerning
his
character
were
certain
to
weigh
heavily
against
him
in
a
case
where
much
must
necessarily
depend
on
the
reputation
of
the
accused
to
a
youthful
imagination
the
idea
of
such
a
punishment
as
mutilation
seems
more
ghastly
than
death
itself
and
every
word
which
he
overheard
among
the
groups
which
he
met
mingled
with
or
overtook
and
passed
announced
this
as
the
penalty
of
his
offence
he
dreaded
to
increase
his
pace
for
fear
of
attracting
suspicion
and
more
than
once
saw
the
ranger
officers
so
near
him
that
his
wrist
tingled
as
if
already
under
the
blade
of
the
dismembering
knife
at
length
he
got
out
of
the
park
and
had
a
little
more
leisure
to
consider
what
he
was
next
to
do
whitefriars
adjacent
to
the
temple
then
well
known
by
the
cant
name
of
alsatia
had
at
this
time
and
for
nearly
a
century
afterwards
the
privilege
of
a
sanctuary
unless
against
the
writ
of
the
lord
chief
justice
or
of
the
lords
of
the
indeed
as
the
place
abounded
with
desperadoes
of
every
description
bankrupt
citizens
ruined
gamesters
irreclaimable
prodigals
desperate
duellists
bravoes
homicides
and
debauched
profligates
of
every
description
all
leagued
together
to
maintain
the
immunities
of
their
asylum
it
was
both
difficult
and
unsafe
for
the
officers
of
the
law
to
execute
warrants
emanating
even
from
the
highest
authority
amongst
men
whose
safety
was
inconsistent
with
warrants
or
authority
of
any
kind
this
lord
glenvarloch
well
knew
and
odious
as
the
place
of
refuge
was
it
seemed
the
only
one
where
for
a
space
at
least
he
might
be
concealed
and
secure
from
the
immediate
grasp
of
the
law
until
he
should
have
leisure
to
provide
better
for
his
safety
or
to
get
this
unpleasant
matter
in
some
shape
accommodated
meanwhile
as
nigel
walked
hastily
forward
towards
the
place
of
sanctuary
he
bitterly
blamed
himself
for
suffering
lord
dalgarno
to
lead
him
into
the
haunts
of
dissipation
and
no
less
accused
his
intemperate
heat
of
passion
which
now
had
driven
him
for
refuge
into
the
purlieus
of
profane
and
avowed
vice
and
debauchery
dalgarno
spoke
but
too
truly
in
that
were
his
bitter
reflections
i
have
made
myself
an
evil
reputation
by
acting
on
his
insidious
counsels
and
neglecting
the
wholesome
admonitions
which
ought
to
have
claimed
implicit
obedience
from
me
and
which
recommended
abstinence
even
from
the
slightest
approach
of
evil
but
if
i
escape
from
the
perilous
labyrinth
in
which
folly
and
inexperience
as
well
as
violent
passions
have
involved
me
i
will
find
some
noble
way
of
redeeming
the
lustre
of
a
name
which
was
never
sullied
until
i
bore
as
lord
glenvarloch
formed
these
prudent
resolutions
he
entered
the
temple
walks
whence
a
gate
at
that
time
opened
into
whitefriars
by
which
as
by
the
more
private
passage
he
proposed
to
betake
himself
to
the
sanctuary
as
he
approached
the
entrance
to
that
den
of
infamy
from
which
his
mind
recoiled
even
while
in
the
act
of
taking
shelter
there
his
pace
slackened
while
the
steep
and
broken
stairs
reminded
him
of
the
descensus
averni
and
rendered
him
doubtful
whether
it
were
not
better
to
brave
the
worst
which
could
befall
him
in
the
public
haunts
of
honourable
men
than
to
evade
punishment
by
secluding
himself
in
those
of
avowed
vice
and
profligacy
as
nigel
hesitated
a
young
gentleman
of
the
temple
advanced
towards
him
whom
he
had
often
seen
and
sometimes
conversed
with
at
the
ordinary
where
he
was
a
frequent
and
welcome
guest
being
a
wild
young
gallant
indifferently
well
provided
with
money
who
spent
at
the
theatres
and
other
gay
places
of
public
resort
the
time
which
his
father
supposed
he
was
employing
in
the
study
of
the
law
but
reginald
lowestoffe
such
was
the
young
templar
name
was
of
opinion
that
little
law
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
spend
the
revenues
of
the
paternal
acres
which
were
to
devolve
upon
him
at
his
father
demose
and
therefore
gave
himself
no
trouble
to
acquire
more
of
that
science
than
might
be
imbibed
along
with
the
learned
air
of
the
region
in
which
he
had
his
chambers
in
other
respects
he
was
one
of
the
wits
of
the
place
read
ovid
and
martial
aimed
at
quick
repartee
and
pun
often
very
far
fetched
danced
fenced
played
at
tennis
and
performed
sundry
tunes
on
the
fiddle
and
french
horn
to
the
great
annoyance
of
old
counsellor
barratter
who
lived
in
the
chambers
immediately
below
him
such
was
reginald
shrewd
alert
and
with
the
town
through
all
its
recesses
but
in
a
sort
of
disrespectable
way
this
gallant
now
approaching
the
lord
glenvarloch
saluted
him
by
name
and
title
and
asked
if
his
lordship
designed
for
the
this
day
observing
it
was
near
noon
and
the
woodcock
would
be
on
the
board
before
they
could
reach
the
ordinary
i
do
not
go
there
answered
lord
glenvarloch
which
way
then
my
lord
said
the
young
templar
who
was
perhaps
not
undesirous
to
parade
a
part
at
least
of
the
street
in
company
with
a
lord
though
but
a
scottish
one
i
i
said
nigel
desiring
to
avail
himself
of
this
young
man
local
knowledge
yet
unwilling
and
ashamed
to
acknowledge
his
intention
to
take
refuge
in
so
disreputable
a
quarter
or
to
describe
the
situation
in
which
he
stood
i
have
some
curiosity
to
see
what
your
lordship
is
for
a
frolic
into
alsatia
said
with
you
my
lord
you
can
not
have
a
better
guide
to
the
infernal
regions
than
myself
i
promise
you
there
are
to
be
found
there
good
wine
too
ay
and
good
fellows
to
drink
it
with
though
somewhat
suffering
under
the
frowns
of
fortune
but
your
lordship
will
pardon
me
you
are
the
last
of
our
acquaintance
to
whom
i
would
have
proposed
such
a
voyage
of
i
am
obliged
to
you
master
lowestoffe
for
the
good
opinion
you
have
expressed
in
the
observation
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
my
present
circumstances
may
render
even
a
residence
of
a
day
or
two
in
the
sanctuary
a
matter
of
indeed
said
lowestoffe
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
i
thought
your
lordship
had
always
taken
care
not
to
risk
any
considerable
stake
i
beg
pardon
but
if
the
bones
have
proved
perfidious
i
know
just
so
much
law
as
that
a
peer
person
is
sacred
from
arrest
and
for
mere
impecuniosity
my
lord
better
shift
can
be
made
elsewhere
than
in
whitefriars
where
all
are
devouring
each
other
for
very
my
misfortune
has
no
connexion
with
want
of
money
said
nigel
why
then
i
suppose
said
lowestoffe
you
have
been
tilting
my
lord
and
have
pinked
your
man
in
which
case
and
with
a
purse
reasonably
furnished
you
may
lie
perdu
in
whitefriars
for
a
twelvemonth
marry
but
you
must
be
entered
and
received
as
a
member
of
their
worshipful
society
my
lord
and
a
frank
burgher
of
alsatia
so
far
you
must
condescend
there
will
be
neither
peace
nor
safety
for
you
my
fault
is
not
in
a
degree
so
deadly
master
lowestoffe
answered
lord
glenvarloch
as
you
seem
to
conjecture
i
have
stricken
a
gentleman
in
the
park
that
is
by
my
hand
my
lord
and
you
had
better
have
struck
your
sword
through
him
at
barns
elms
said
the
templar
strike
within
the
verge
of
the
court
you
will
find
that
a
weighty
dependence
upon
your
hands
especially
if
your
party
be
of
rank
and
have
i
will
be
plain
with
you
master
lowestoffe
said
nigel
since
i
have
gone
thus
far
the
person
i
struck
was
lord
dalgarno
whom
you
have
seen
at
a
follower
and
favourite
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
it
is
a
most
unhappy
chance
my
lord
but
my
heart
was
formed
in
england
and
can
not
bear
to
see
a
young
nobleman
borne
down
as
you
are
like
to
be
we
converse
here
greatly
too
open
for
your
circumstances
the
templars
would
suffer
no
bailiff
to
execute
a
writ
and
no
gentleman
to
be
arrested
for
a
duel
within
their
precincts
but
in
such
a
matter
between
lord
dalgarno
and
your
lordship
there
might
be
a
party
on
either
side
you
must
away
with
me
instantly
to
my
poor
chambers
here
hard
by
and
undergo
some
little
change
of
dress
ere
you
take
sanctuary
for
else
you
will
have
the
whole
rascal
rout
of
the
friars
about
you
like
crows
upon
a
falcon
that
strays
into
their
rookery
we
must
have
you
arrayed
something
more
like
the
natives
of
alsatia
or
there
will
be
no
life
there
for
while
lowestoffe
spoke
he
pulled
lord
glenvarloch
along
with
him
into
his
chambers
where
he
had
a
handsome
library
filled
with
all
the
poems
and
which
were
then
in
fashion
the
templar
then
dispatched
a
boy
who
waited
upon
him
to
procure
a
dish
or
two
from
the
next
shop
and
this
he
said
must
be
your
lordship
dinner
with
a
glass
of
old
sack
of
which
my
grandmother
the
heavens
requite
her
sent
me
a
dozen
bottles
with
charge
to
use
the
liquor
only
with
clarified
whey
when
i
felt
my
breast
ache
with
over
study
marry
we
will
drink
the
good
lady
health
in
it
if
it
is
your
lordship
pleasure
and
you
shall
see
how
we
poor
students
eke
out
our
in
the
the
outward
door
of
the
chambers
was
barred
so
soon
as
the
boy
had
with
the
food
the
boy
was
ordered
to
keep
close
watch
and
admit
no
one
and
lowestoffe
by
example
and
precept
pressed
his
noble
guest
to
partake
of
his
hospitality
his
frank
and
forward
manners
though
much
differing
from
the
courtly
ease
of
lord
dalgarno
were
calculated
to
make
a
favourable
impression
and
lord
glenvarloch
though
his
experience
of
dalgarno
perfidy
had
taught
him
to
be
cautious
of
reposing
faith
in
friendly
professions
could
not
avoid
testifying
his
gratitude
to
the
young
templar
who
seemed
so
anxious
for
his
safety
and
accommodation
you
may
spare
your
gratitude
any
great
sense
of
obligation
my
lord
said
the
templar
no
doubt
i
am
willing
to
be
of
use
to
any
gentleman
that
has
cause
to
sing
my
and
particularly
proud
to
serve
your
lordship
turn
but
i
have
also
an
old
grudge
to
speak
truth
at
your
opposite
lord
may
i
ask
on
what
account
master
lowestoffe
said
lord
glenvarloch
o
my
lord
replied
the
templar
it
was
for
a
hap
that
chanced
after
you
left
the
ordinary
one
evening
about
three
weeks
since
at
least
i
think
you
were
not
by
as
your
lordship
always
left
us
before
deep
play
began
i
mean
no
offence
but
such
was
your
lordship
custom
when
there
were
words
between
lord
dalgarno
and
me
concerning
a
certain
game
at
gleek
and
a
certain
mournival
of
aces
held
by
his
lordship
which
went
for
eight
tib
which
went
for
fifteen
in
all
now
i
held
king
and
queen
being
three
a
natural
towser
making
fifteen
and
tiddy
nineteen
we
vied
the
ruff
and
revied
as
your
lordship
may
suppose
till
the
stake
was
equal
to
half
my
yearly
exhibition
fifty
as
fair
yellow
canary
birds
as
chirped
in
the
bottom
of
a
green
silk
purse
well
my
lord
i
gained
the
cards
and
lo
you
it
pleases
his
lordship
to
say
that
we
played
without
tiddy
and
as
the
rest
stood
by
and
backed
him
and
especially
the
sharking
frenchman
why
i
was
obliged
to
lose
more
than
i
shall
gain
all
the
so
judge
if
i
have
not
a
crow
to
pluck
with
his
lordship
was
it
ever
heard
there
was
a
game
at
gleek
at
the
ordinary
before
without
counting
tiddy
marry
quep
upon
his
lordship
every
man
who
comes
there
with
his
purse
in
his
hand
is
as
free
to
make
new
laws
as
he
i
hope
since
touch
pot
touch
penny
makes
every
man
as
master
lowestoffe
ran
over
this
jargon
of
the
lord
glenvarloch
was
both
ashamed
and
mortified
and
felt
a
severe
pang
of
aristocratic
pride
when
he
concluded
in
the
sweeping
clause
that
the
dice
like
the
grave
levelled
those
distinguishing
points
of
society
to
which
nigel
early
prejudices
clung
perhaps
but
too
fondly
it
was
impossible
however
to
object
any
thing
to
the
learned
reasoning
of
the
young
templar
and
therefore
nigel
was
contented
to
turn
the
conversation
by
making
some
inquiries
respecting
the
present
state
of
there
also
his
host
was
at
home
you
know
my
lord
said
master
lowestoffe
that
we
templars
are
a
power
and
a
dominion
within
ourselves
and
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
hold
some
rank
in
our
republic
was
treasurer
to
the
lord
of
misrule
last
year
and
am
at
this
present
moment
in
nomination
for
that
dignity
myself
in
such
circumstances
we
are
under
the
necessity
of
maintaining
an
amicable
intercourse
with
our
neighbours
of
alsatia
even
as
the
christian
states
find
themselves
often
in
mere
policy
obliged
to
make
alliance
with
the
grand
turk
or
the
barbary
i
should
have
imagined
you
gentlemen
of
the
temple
more
independent
of
your
neighbours
said
lord
glenvarloch
you
do
us
something
too
much
honour
my
lord
said
the
templar
the
alsatians
and
we
have
some
common
enemies
and
we
have
under
the
rose
some
common
friends
we
are
in
the
use
of
blocking
all
bailiffs
out
of
our
bounds
and
we
are
powerfully
aided
by
our
neighbours
who
tolerate
not
a
rag
belonging
to
them
within
theirs
moreover
the
alsatians
have
i
beg
you
to
understand
me
the
power
of
protecting
or
distressing
our
friends
male
or
female
who
may
be
obliged
to
seek
sanctuary
within
their
bounds
in
short
the
two
communities
serve
each
other
though
the
league
is
between
states
of
unequal
quality
and
i
may
myself
say
that
i
have
treated
of
sundry
weighty
affairs
and
have
been
a
negotiator
well
approved
on
both
but
hark
hark
what
is
that
the
sound
by
which
master
lowestoffe
was
interrupted
was
that
of
a
distant
horn
winded
loud
and
keenly
and
followed
by
a
faint
and
remote
huzza
there
is
something
doing
said
lowestoffe
in
the
whitefriars
at
this
moment
that
is
the
signal
when
their
privileges
are
invaded
by
tipstaff
or
bailiff
and
at
the
blast
of
the
horn
they
all
swarm
out
to
the
rescue
as
bees
when
their
hive
is
jump
jim
he
said
calling
out
to
the
attendant
and
see
what
they
are
doing
in
that
bastard
of
a
boy
he
continued
as
the
lad
accustomed
to
the
precipitate
haste
of
his
master
tumbled
rather
than
ran
out
of
the
apartment
and
so
down
stairs
is
worth
gold
in
this
quarter
he
serves
six
masters
four
of
them
in
distinct
numbers
and
you
would
think
him
present
like
a
fairy
at
the
mere
wish
of
him
that
for
the
time
most
needs
his
attendance
no
scout
in
oxford
no
gip
in
cambridge
ever
matched
him
in
speed
and
intelligence
he
knows
the
step
of
a
dun
from
that
of
a
client
when
it
reaches
the
very
bottom
of
the
staircase
can
tell
the
trip
of
a
pretty
wench
from
the
step
of
a
bencher
when
at
the
upper
end
of
the
court
and
is
take
him
all
in
all
but
i
see
your
lordship
is
anxious
may
i
press
another
cup
of
my
kind
cordial
or
will
you
allow
me
to
show
you
my
wardrobe
and
act
as
your
valet
or
groom
of
the
chamber
lord
glenvarloch
hesitated
not
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
painfully
sensible
of
his
present
situation
and
anxious
to
do
what
must
needs
be
done
for
his
extrication
the
and
thoughtless
young
templar
readily
acquiesced
and
led
the
way
into
his
little
bedroom
where
from
bandboxes
portmanteaus
not
forgetting
an
old
wardrobe
he
began
to
select
the
articles
which
he
thought
best
suited
effectually
to
disguise
his
guest
in
venturing
into
the
lawless
and
turbulent
society
of
alsatia
chapter

come
hither
young
one
mark
me
thou
art
now
men
o
the
sword
that
live
by
reputation
more
than
by
constant
income
they
are
i
grant
you
yet
each
single
suit
maintains
on
the
rough
guess
a
thousand
followers
and
they
be
men
who
hazarding
their
all
needful
apparel
necessary
income
and
human
body
and
immortal
soul
do
in
the

play
better
than

his
game
on

your
lordship
said
reginald
lowestoffe
must
be
content
to
exchange
your
decent
and
rapier
which
i
will
retain
in
safe
keeping
for
this
broadsword
with
an
hundredweight
of
rusty
iron
about
the
hilt
and
to
wear
these
slops
instead
of
your
civil
and
moderate
hose
we
allow
no
cloak
for
your
ruffian
always

and
the
tarnished
doublet
of

velvet
with
its
discoloured
embroidery
and
i
grieve
to
speak
it
a
few
stains
from
the
blood

roaring
boy
i
will
leave
you
to
change
your
suit
for
an

till
i
can
help
to
truss
lowestoffe
retired
while
slowly
and
with
hesitation
nigel
obeyed
his
instructions
he
felt
displeasure
and
disgust
at
the
scoundrelly
disguise
which
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
assuming
but
when
he
considered
the
bloody
consequences
which
law
attached
to
his
rash
act
of
violence
the
easy
and
indifferent
temper
of
james
the
prejudices
of
his
son
the
overbearing
influence
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
which
was
sure
to
be
thrown
into
the
scale
against
him
and
above
all
when
he
reflected
that
he
must
now
look
upon
the
active
assiduous
and
insinuating
lord
dalgarno
as
a
bitter
enemy
reason
told
him
he
was
in
a
situation
of
peril
which
authorised
all
honest
means
even
the
most
unseemly
in
outward
appearance
to
extricate
himself
from
so
dangerous
a
predicament
while
he
was
changing
his
dress
and
musing
on
these
particulars
his
friendly
host
the
sleeping
apartment
zounds
he
said
my
lord
it
was
well
you
went
not
straight
into
that
same
alsatia
of
ours
at
the
time
you
proposed
for
the
hawks
have
stooped
upon
it
here
is
jem
come
back
with
tidings
that
he
saw
a
pursuivant
there
with
a
warrant
and
half
a
score
of
yeomen
assistants
armed
to
the
teeth
and
the
horn
which
we
heard
was
sounded
to
call
out
the
posse
of
the
friars
indeed
when
old
duke
hildebrod
saw
that
the
quest
was
after
some
one
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
he
permitted
out
of
courtesy
the
to
search
through
his
dominions
quite
certain
that
they
would
take
little
by
their
motions
for
duke
hildebrod
is
a
most
judicious
go
back
you
bastard
and
bring
us
word
when
all
is
and
who
may
duke
hildebrod
be
said
lord
glenvarloch
nouns
my
lord
said
the
templar
have
you
lived
so
long
on
the
town
and
never
heard
of
the
valiant
and
as
wise
and
politic
as
valiant
duke
hildebrod
grand
protector
of
the
liberties
of
alsatia
i
thought
the
man
had
never
whirled
a
die
but
was
familiar
with
his
yet
i
have
never
heard
of
him
master
lowestoffe
said
lord
glenvarloch
or
what
is
the
same
thing
i
have
paid
no
attention
to
aught
that
may
have
passed
in
conversation
respecting
why
then
said
lowestoffe
but
first
let
me
have
the
honour
of
trussing
you
now
observe
i
have
left
several
of
the
points
untied
of
set
purpose
and
if
it
please
you
to
let
a
small
portion
of
your
shirt
be
seen
betwixt
your
doublet
and
the
band
of
your
upper
stock
it
will
have
so
much
the
more
rakish
effect
and
will
attract
you
respect
in
alsatia
where
linen
is
something
scarce
now
i
tie
some
of
the
points
carefully
asquint
for
your
ruffianly
gallant
never
appears
too
accurately
trussed
arrange
it
as
you
will
sir
said
nigel
but
let
me
hear
at
least
something
of
the
conditions
of
the
unhappy
district
into
which
with
other
wretches
i
am
compelled
to
why
my
lord
replied
the
templar
our
neighbouring
state
of
alsatia
which
the
law
calls
the
sanctuary
of
has
had
its
mutations
and
revolutions
like
greater
kingdoms
and
being
in
some
sort
a
lawless
arbitrary
government
it
follows
of
course
that
these
have
been
more
frequent
than
our
own
better
regulated
commonwealth
of
the
templars
that
of
gray
inn
and
other
similar
associations
have
had
the
fortune
to
witness
our
traditions
and
records
speak
of
twenty
revolutions
within
the
last
twelve
years
in
which
the
aforesaid
state
has
repeatedly
changed
from
absolute
despotism
to
republicanism
not
forgetting
the
intermediate
stages
of
oligarchy
limited
monarchy
and
even
gynocracy
for
i
myself
remember
alsatia
governed
for
nearly
nine
months
by
an
old
hen
it
fell
under
the
dominion
of
a
broken
attorney
who
was
dethroned
by
a
reformado
captain
who
proving
tyrannical
was
deposed
by
a
hedgeparson
who
was
succeeded
upon
resignation
of
his
power
by
duke
jacob
hildebrod
of
that
name
the
first
whom
heaven
long
and
is
this
potentate
government
said
lord
glenvarloch
forcing
himself
to
take
some
interest
in
the
conversation
of
a
despotic
character
pardon
me
my
lord
said
the
templar
this
said
sovereign
is
too
wise
to
incur
like
many
of
his
predecessors
the
odium
of
wielding
so
important
an
authority
by
his
own
sole
will
he
has
established
a
council
of
state
who
regularly
meet
for
their
morning
draught
at
seven
convene
a
second
time
at
eleven
for
their
or
whet
and
assembling
in
solemn
conclave
at
the
hour
of
two
afternoon
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
for
the
good
of
the
commonwealth
are
so
prodigal
of
their
labour
in
the
service
of
the
state
that
they
seldom
separate
before
midnight
into
this
worthy
senate
composed
partly
of
duke
hildebrod
predecessors
in
his
high
office
whom
he
has
associated
with
him
to
prevent
the
envy
attending
sovereign
and
sole
authority
i
must
presently
introduce
your
lordship
that
they
may
admit
you
to
the
immunities
of
the
friars
and
assign
you
a
place
of
does
their
authority
extend
to
such
regulation
said
lord
glenvarloch
the
council
account
it
a
main
point
of
their
privileges
my
lord
answered
lowestoffe
and
in
fact
it
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
means
by
which
they
support
their
authority
for
when
duke
ilildebrod
and
his
senate
find
a
topping
householder
in
the
friars
becomes
discontented
and
factious
it
is
but
assigning
him
for
a
lodger
some
fat
bankrupt
or
new
lesidenter
whose
circumstances
require
refuge
and
whose
purse
can
pay
for
it
and
the
malecontent
becomes
as
tractable
as
a
lamb
as
for
the
poorer
refugees
they
let
them
shift
as
they
can
but
the
registration
of
their
names
in
the
duke
and
the
payment
of
garnish
conforming
to
their
circumstances
is
never
dispensed
with
and
the
friars
would
be
a
very
unsafe
residence
for
the
stranger
who
should
dispute
these
points
of
well
master
lowestoffe
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
must
be
controlled
by
the
circumstances
which
dictate
to
me
this
state
of
concealment
of
course
i
am
desirous
not
to
betray
my
name
and
it
will
be
highly
advisable
my
lord
said
lowestoffe
and
is
a
case
thus
provided
for
in
the
statutes
of
the
republic
or
monarchy
or
whatsoever
you
call
he
who
desires
that
no
questions
shall
be
asked
him
concerning
his
name
cause
of
refuge
and
the
like
may
escape
the
usual
interrogations
upon
payment
of
double
the
garnish
otherwise
belonging
to
his
condition
complying
with
this
essential
stipulation
your
lordship
may
register
yourself
as
king
of
bantam
if
you
will
for
not
a
question
will
be
asked
of
but
here
comes
our
scout
with
news
of
peace
and
tranquillity
now
i
will
go
with
your
lordship
myself
and
present
you
to
the
council
of
alsatia
with
all
the
influence
which
i
have
over
them
as
an
in
the
temple
which
is
not
slight
for
they
have
come
halting
off
upon
all
occasions
when
we
have
taken
part
against
them
and
that
they
well
know
the
time
is
propitious
for
as
the
council
is
now
met
in
alsatia
so
the
temple
walks
are
quiet
now
my
lord
throw
your
cloak
about
you
to
hide
your
present
exterior
you
shall
give
it
to
the
boy
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
go
down
to
the
sanctuary
and
as
the
ballad
says
that
queen
eleanor
sunk
at
charing
cross
and
rose
at
queenhithe
so
you
shall
sink
a
nobleman
in
the
temple
gardens
and
rise
an
alsatian
at
they
went
out
accordingly
attended
by
the
little
scout
traversed
the
gardens
descended
the
stairs
and
at
the
bottom
the
young
templar
exclaimed

now

he
continued
in
the
same
vein
via
the
curtain
that
shadowed
borgia
but
how
now
my
lord
he
continued
when
he
observed
lord
glenvarloch
was
really
distressed
at
the
degrading
change
in
his
situation
i
trust
you
are
not
offended
at
my
rattling
folly
i
would
but
reconcile
you
to
your
present
circumstances
and
give
you
the
tone
of
this
strange
place
come
cheer
up
i
trust
it
will
only
be
your
residence
for
a
very
few
nigel
was
only
able
to
press
his
hand
and
reply
in
a
whisper
i
am
sensible
of
your
kindness
i
know
i
must
drink
the
cup
which
my
own
folly
has
filled
for
me
pardon
me
that
at
the
first
taste
i
feel
its
reginald
lowestoffe
was
bustlingly
officious
and
but
used
to
live
a
scrambling
rakish
course
of
life
himself
he
had
not
the
least
idea
of
the
extent
of
lord
glenvarloch
mental
sufferings
and
thought
of
his
temporary
concealment
as
if
it
were
merely
the
trick
of
a
wanton
boy
who
plays
at
with
his
tutor
with
the
appearance
of
the
place
too
he
was
familiar
but
on
his
companion
it
produced
a
deep
sensation
the
ancient
sanctuary
at
whitefriars
lay
considerably
lower
than
the
elevated
terraces
and
gardens
of
the
temple
and
was
therefore
generally
involved
in
the
damps
and
fogs
arising
from
the
thames
the
brick
buildings
by
which
it
was
occupied
crowded
closely
on
each
other
for
in
a
place
so
rarely
privileged
every
foot
of
ground
was
valuable
but
erected
in
many
cases
by
persons
whose
funds
were
inadequate
to
their
speculations
the
houses
were
generally
insufficient
and
exhibited
the
lamentable
signs
of
having
become
ruinous
while
they
were
yet
new
the
wailing
of
children
the
scolding
of
their
mothers
the
miserable
exhibition
of
ragged
linens
hung
from
the
windows
to
dry
spoke
the
wants
and
distresses
of
the
wretched
inhabitants
while
the
sounds
of
complaint
were
mocked
and
overwhelmed
in
the
riotous
shouts
oaths
profane
songs
and
boisterous
laughter
that
issued
from
the
alehouses
and
taverns
which
as
the
signs
indicated
were
equal
in
number
to
all
the
other
houses
and
that
the
full
character
of
the
place
might
be
evident
several
faded
tinselled
and
painted
females
looked
boldly
at
the
strangers
from
their
open
lattices
or
more
modestly
seemed
busied
with
the
cracked
filled
with
mignonette
and
rosemary
which
were
disposed
in
front
of
the
windows
to
the
great
risk
of
the
passengers
said
the
templar
pointing
to
one
of
these
nymphs
who
seemed
afraid
of
observation
and
partly
concealed
herself
behind
the
casement
as
she
chirped
to
a
miserable
blackbird

tenant
of
a
wicker
prison
which
hung
outside
on
the
black
brick

know
the
face
of
yonder
waistcoateer
continued
the
guide
and
i
could
wager
a
from
the
posture
she
stands
in
that
she
has
clean
and
a
soiled
but
here
come
two
of
the
male
inhabitants
smoking
like
moving
volcanoes
these
are
roaring

shaggy
uncombed
ruffians
whose
enormous
mustaches
were
turned
back
over
their
ears
and
mingled
with
the
wild
of
their
hair
much
of
which
was
seen
under
the
old
beavers
which
they
wore
aside
upon
their
heads
while
some
straggling
portion
escaped
through
the
rents
of
the
hats

tarnished
plush

large
slops
or
their
broad
greasy

raillery
upon
the
subject
of
their
names
i
beg
pardon
my
lord
answered
the
undisconcerted
punster
but
will
suit
the
circumstance
too
it
signifies
tribulation
in
the
high
dutch
and
your
lordship
must
be
considered
as
a
man
under
nigel
laughed
at
the
pertinacity
of
the
templar
who
proceeding
to
point
out
a
sign
representing
or
believed
to
represent
a
dog
attacking
a
bull
and
running
at
his
head
in
the
true
scientific
style
of
onset
there
said
he
doth
faithful
duke
hildebrod
deal
forth
laws
as
well
as
ale
and
strong
waters
to
his
faithful
alsatians
being
a
determined
champion
of
paris
garden
he
has
chosen
a
sign
corresponding
to
his
habits
and
he
deals
in
giving
drink
to
the
thirsty
that
he
himself
may
drink
without
paying
and
receive
pay
for
what
is
drunken
by
let
us
enter
the
gate
of
this
second
as
they
spoke
they
entered
the
dilapidated
tavern
which
was
nevertheless
more
ample
in
dimensions
and
less
ruinous
than
many
houses
in
the
same
evil
neighbourhood
two
or
three
haggard
ragged
drawers
ran
to
and
fro
whose
looks
like
those
of
owls
seemed
only
adapted
for
midnight
when
other
creatures
sleep
and
who
by
day
seemed
bleared
stupid
and
only
half
awake
guided
by
one
of
these
blinking
ganymedes
they
entered
a
room
where
the
feeble
rays
of
the
sun
were
almost
wholly
eclipsed
by
volumes
of
rolled
from
the
tubes
of
the
company
while
out
of
the
cloudy
sanctuary
arose
the
old
chant
of
old
sir
simon
the
king
and
old
sir
simon
the
king
with
his
malmsey
nose
and
his
hose
and
sing
hey
duke
hildebrod
who
himself
condescended
to
chant
this
ditty
to
his
loving
subjects
was
a
monstrously
fat
old
man
with
only
one
eye
and
a
nose
which
bore
evidence
to
the
frequency
strength
and
depth
of
his
potations
he
wore
a
plush
jerkin
stained
with
the
overflowings
of
the
tankard
and
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
unbuttoned
at
bottom
for
the
ease
of
his
enormous
paunch
behind
him
lay
a
favourite
whose
round
head
and
single
black
glancing
eye
as
well
as
the
creature
great
corpulence
gave
it
a
burlesque
resemblance
to
its
master
the
counsellors
who
surrounded
the
ducal
throne
incensed
it
with
tobacco
pledged
its
occupier
in
thick
clammy
ale
and
echoed
back
his
choral
songs
were
satraps
worthy
of
such
a
soldan
the
buff
jerkin
broad
belt
and
long
sword
of
one
showed
him
to
be
a
low
country
soldier
whose
look
of
scowling
importance
and
drunken
impudence
were
designed
to
sustain
his
title
to
call
himself
a
roving
blade
it
seemed
to
nigel
that
he
had
seen
this
fellow
somewhere
or
other
a
or
as
that
order
of
priesthood
has
been
irreverently
termed
sat
on
the
duke
left
and
was
easily
distinguished
by
his
torn
band
flapped
hat
and
the
remnants
of
a
rusty
cassock
beside
the
parson
sat
a
most
wretched
and
old
man
with
a
threadbare
hood
of
coarse
kersey
upon
his
head
and
buttoned
about
his
neck
while
his
pinched
features
like
those
of
old
daniel
were
illuminated
by
an
eye
through
the
last
look
of
dotage
still
cunning
and
on
his
left
was
placed
a
broken
attorney
who
for
some
malpractices
had
been
struck
from
the
roll
of
practitioners
and
who
had
nothing
left
of
his
profession
except
its
roguery
one
or
two
persons
of
less
figure
amongst
whom
there
was
one
face
which
like
that
of
the
soldier
seemed
not
unknown
to
nigel
though
he
could
not
recollect
where
he
had
seen
it
completed
the
of
jacob
duke
hildebrod
the
strangers
had
full
time
to
observe
all
this
for
his
grace
the
duke
whether
irresistibly
carried
on
by
the
full
tide
of
harmony
or
whether
to
impress
the
strangers
with
a
proper
idea
of
his
consequence
chose
to
sing
his
ditty
to
an
end
before
addressing
them
though
during
the
whole
time
he
closely
scrutinized
them
with
his
single
optic
when
duke
hildebrod
had
ended
his
song
he
informed
his
peers
that
a
worthy
officer
of
the
temple
attended
them
and
commanded
the
captain
and
parson
to
abandon
their
easy
chairs
in
behalf
of
the
two
strangers
whom
he
placed
on
his
right
and
left
hand
the
worthy
representative
of
the
army
and
the
church
of
alsatia
went
to
place
themselves
on
a
crazy
form
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
which
ill
calculated
to
sustain
men
of
such
weight
gave
way
under
them
and
the
man
of
the
sword
and
man
of
the
gown
were
rolled
over
each
other
on
the
floor
amidst
the
exulting
shouts
of
the
company
they
arose
in
wrath
contending
which
should
vent
his
displeasure
in
the
loudest
and
deepest
oaths
a
strife
in
which
the
parson
superior
acquaintance
with
theology
enabled
him
greatly
to
excel
the
captain
and
were
at
length
with
difficulty
tranquillised
by
the
arrival
of
the
alarmed
waiters
with
more
stable
chairs
and
by
a
long
draught
of
the
cooling
tankard
when
this
commotion
was
appeased
and
the
strangers
courteously
accommodated
with
flagons
after
the
fashion
of
the
others
present
the
duke
drank
prosperity
to
the
temple
in
the
most
gracious
manner
together
with
a
cup
of
welcome
to
master
reginald
lowestoffe
and
this
courtesy
having
been
thankfully
accepted
the
party
honoured
prayed
permission
to
call
for
a
gallon
of
rhenish
over
which
he
proposed
to
open
his
business
the
mention
of
a
liquor
so
superior
to
their
usual
potations
had
an
instant
and
most
favourable
effect
upon
the
little
senate
and
its
immediate
appearance
might
be
said
to
secure
a
favourable
reception
of
master
lowestoffe
proposition
which
after
a
round
or
two
had
circulated
he
explained
to
be
the
admission
of
his
friend
master
nigel
grahame
to
the
benefit
of
the
sanctuary
and
other
immunities
of
alsatia
in
the
character
of
a
grand
compounder
for
so
were
those
termed
who
paid
a
double
fee
at
their
matriculation
in
order
to
avoid
laying
before
the
senate
the
peculiar
circumstances
which
compelled
them
to
take
refuge
there
the
worthy
duke
heard
the
proposition
with
glee
which
glittered
in
his
single
eye
and
no
wonder
as
it
was
a
rare
occurrence
and
of
peculiar
advantage
to
his
private
revenue
accordingly
he
commanded
his
ducal
register
to
be
brought
him
a
huge
book
secured
with
brass
clasps
like
a
merchant
ledger
and
whose
leaves
stained
with
wine
and
slabbered
with
tobacco
juice
bore
the
names
probably
of
as
many
rogues
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
calendar
of
newgate
nigel
was
then
directed
to
lay
down
two
nobles
as
his
ransom
and
to
claim
privilege
by
reciting
the
following
doggerel
verses
which
were
dictated
to
him
by
the
duke

suppliant

hildebrod

began
to

the
entry

already
with
superfluous
generosity
spelled

interrupted

footnote
this
curious
register
is
still
in
existence
being
in
possession
of
that
eminent
antiquary
dryasdust
who
liberally
offered
the
author
permission
to
have
the
autograph
of
duke
hildebrod
engraved
as
an
illustration
of
this
passage
unhappily
being
rigorous
as
ritson
himself
in
adhering
to
the
very
letter
of
his
copy
the
worthy
doctor
clogged
his
munificence
with
the
condition
that
we
should
adopt
the
duke
orthography
and
entitle
the
work
the
fortunes
of
niggle
with
which
stipulation
we
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
comply
this
reverend
gentleman
had
been
whispering
for
a
minute
or
two
not
with
the
captain
but
with
that
other
individual
who
dwelt
imperfectly
as
we
have
already
mentioned
in
nigel
memory
and
being
perhaps
still
something
malecontent
on
account
of
the
late
accident
he
now
requested
to
be
heard
before
the
registration
took
place

person
he
said
who
hath
now
had
the
assurance
to
propose
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
this
honourable
society
is
in
plain
terms
a
beggarly
scot
and
we
have
enough
of
these
locusts
in
london
already
if
we
admit
such
and
caterpillars
to
the
sanctuary
we
shall
soon
have
the
whole
we
are
not
entitled
to
inquire
said
duke
hildebrod
whether
he
be
scot
or
french
or
english
seeing
he
has
honourably
laid
down
his
garnish
he
is
entitled
to
our
word
of
denial
most
sovereign
duke
replied
the
parson
i
ask
him
no
questions
his
speech
betrayeth
him
he
is
a
galilean
and
his
garnish
is
forfeited
for
his
assurance
in
coming
within
this
our
realm
and
i
call
on
you
sir
duke
to
put
the
laws
in
force
against
him
the
templar
here
rose
and
was
about
to
interrupt
the
deliberations
of
the
court
when
the
duke
gravely
assured
him
that
he
should
be
heard
in
behalf
of
his
friend
so
soon
as
the
council
had
finished
their
deliberations
the
attorney
next
rose
and
intimating
that
he
was
to
speak
to
the
point
of
law
said
it
was
easy
to
be
seen
that
this
gentleman
did
not
come
here
in
any
civil
case
and
that
he
believed
it
to
be
the
story
they
had
already
heard
of
concerning
a
blow
given
within
the
verge
of
the
park
that
the
sanctuary
would
not
bear
out
the
offender
in
such
case
and
that
the
queer
old
chief
would
send
down
a
broom
which
would
sweep
the
streets
of
alsatia
from
the
strand
to
the
stairs
and
it
was
even
policy
to
think
what
evil
might
come
to
their
republic
by
sheltering
an
alien
in
such
the
captain
who
had
sat
impatiently
while
these
opinions
were
expressed
now
sprung
on
his
feet
with
the
vehemence
of
a
cork
bouncing
from
a
bottle
of
brisk
beer
and
turning
up
his
mustaches
with
a
martial
air
cast
a
glance
of
contempt
on
the
lawyer
and
churchman
while
he
thus
expressed
his
opinion
most
noble
duke
hildebrod
when
i
hear
such
base
skeldering
coistril
propositions
come
from
the
counsellors
of
your
grace
and
when
i
remember
the
huffs
the
muns
and
the
tityretu
by
whom
your
ancestors
and
predecessors
were
advised
on
such
occasions
i
begin
to
think
the
spirit
of
action
is
as
dead
in
alsatia
as
in
my
old
grannam
and
yet
who
thinks
so
thinks
a
lie
since
i
will
find
as
many
roaring
boys
in
the
friars
as
shall
keep
the
liberties
against
all
the
scavengers
of
westminster
and
if
we
should
be
overborne
for
a
turn
death
and
darkness
have
we
not
time
to
send
the
gentleman
off
by
water
either
to
paris
garden
or
to
the
bankside
and
if
he
is
a
gallant
of
true
breed
will
he
not
make
us
full
amends
for
all
the
trouble
we
have
let
other
societies
exist
by
the
law
i
say
that
we
brisk
boys
of
the
fleet
live
in
spite
of
it
and
thrive
best
when
we
are
in
right
opposition
to
sign
and
seal
writ
and
warrant
sergeant
and
tipstaff
catchpoll
and
this
speech
was
followed
by
a
murmur
of
approbation
and
lowestoffe
striking
in
before
the
favourable
sound
had
subsided
reminded
the
duke
and
his
council
how
much
the
security
of
their
state
depended
upon
the
amity
of
the
templars
who
by
closing
their
gates
could
at
pleasure
shut
against
the
alsatians
the
communication
betwixt
the
friars
and
the
temple
and
that
as
they
conducted
themselves
on
this
occasion
so
would
they
secure
or
lose
the
benefit
of
his
interest
with
his
own
body
which
they
knew
not
to
be
inconsiderable
and
in
respect
of
my
friend
being
a
scotsman
and
alien
as
has
been
observed
by
the
reverend
divine
and
learned
lawyer
you
are
to
consider
said
lowestoffe
for
what
he
is
pursued
hither
why
for
giving
the
bastinado
not
to
an
englishman
but
to
one
of
his
own
countrymen
and
for
my
own
simple
part
he
continued
touching
lord
glenvarloch
at
the
same
time
to
make
him
understand
he
spoke
but
in
jest
if
all
the
scots
in
london
were
to
fight
a
welsh
main
and
kill
each
other
to
a
man
the
survivor
would
in
my
humble
opinion
be
entitled
to
our
gratitude
as
having
done
a
most
acceptable
service
to
poor
old
a
shout
of
laughter
and
applause
followed
this
ingenious
apology
for
the
client
state
of
alienage
and
the
templar
followed
up
his
plea
with
the
following
pithy
proposition
i
know
well
said
he
it
is
the
custom
of
the
fathers
of
this
old
and
honourable
republic
ripely
and
well
to
consider
all
their
proceedings
over
a
proper
allowance
of
liquor
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
propose
the
breach
of
so
laudable
a
custom
or
to
pretend
that
such
an
affair
as
the
present
can
be
well
and
constitutionally
considered
during
the
discussion
of
a
pitiful
gallon
of
rhenish
but
as
it
is
the
same
thing
to
this
honourable
conclave
whether
they
drink
first
and
determine
afterwards
or
whether
they
determine
first
and
drink
afterwards
i
propose
your
grace
with
the
advice
of
your
wise
and
potent
senators
shall
pass
your
edict
granting
to
mine
honourable
friend
the
immunities
of
the
place
and
assigning
him
a
lodging
according
to
your
wise
forms
to
which
he
will
presently
retire
being
somewhat
spent
with
this
day
action
whereupon
i
will
presently
order
you
a
rundlet
of
rhenish
with
a
corresponding
quantity
of
neats
tongues
and
pickled
herrings
to
make
you
all
as
glorious
as
this
overture
was
received
with
a
general
shout
of
applause
which
altogether
drowned
the
voice
of
the
dissidents
if
any
there
were
amongst
the
alsatian
senate
who
could
have
resisted
a
proposal
so
popular
the
words
of
kind
heart
noble
gentleman
generous
gallant
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
inscription
of
the
petitioner
name
in
the
great
book
was
hastily
completed
and
the
oath
administered
to
him
by
the
worthy
doge
like
the
laws
of
the
twelve
tables
of
the
ancient
and
other
primitive
nations
it
was
couched
in
poetry
and
ran
as
follows
by
spigot
and
barrel
by
bilboe
and
buff
thou
art
sworn
to
the
quarrel
of
the
blades
of
the
huff
for
whitefriars
and
its
claims
to
be
champion
or
martyr
and
to
fight
for
its
dames
like
a
knight
of
the
nigel
felt
and
indeed
exhibited
some
disgust
at
this
mummery
but
the
templar
reminding
him
that
he
was
too
far
advanced
to
draw
back
he
repeated
the
words
or
rather
assented
as
they
were
repeated
by
duke
hildebrod
who
concluded
the
ceremony
by
allowing
him
the
privilege
of
sanctuary
in
the
following
form
of
prescriptive
doggerel
from
the
touch
of
the
tip
from
the
blight
of
the
warrant
from
the
watchmen
who

speech
that

a
thrall
i
charm
thee
from

i
charm
thee
from
all
thy
freedom
complete
as
a
blade
of
the
huff
to
be
cheated
and
cheat
to
be
cuff
and
to
cuff
to
stride
swear
and
swagger
to
drink
till
you
stagger
to
stare
and
to
stab
and
to
brandish
your
dagger
in
the
cause
of
your
drab
to
walk
in
winter
drink
brandy
and
smoke
and
go
in

for

of

the

i

the

of
the

words
used
in
this
inauguratory
oration
some
are
obvious
in
their
meaning
others
as

and
the
like
derive
their
source
from
that
ancient
piece
of
lexicography
the
slang
dictionary
this
homily
being
performed
a
dispute
arose
concerning
the
special
residence
to
be
assigned
the
new
brother
of
the
sanctuary
for
as
the
alsatians
held
it
a
maxim
in
their
commonwealth
that
ass
milk
fattens
there
was
usually
a
competition
among
the
inhabitants
which
should
have
the
managing
as
it
was
termed
of
a
new
member
of
the
society
the
hector
who
had
spoken
so
warmly
and
critically
in
nigel
behalf
stood
out
now
chivalrously
in
behalf
of
a
certain
blowselinda
or
bonstrops
who
had
it
seems
a
room
to
hire
once
the
occasional
residence
of
slicing
dick
of
paddington
who
lately
suffered
at
tyburn
and
whose
untimely
exit
had
been
hitherto
mourned
by
the
damsel
in
solitary
widowhood
after
the
fashion
of
the
the
captain
interest
was
however
overruled
in
behalf
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
kersey
hood
who
was
believed
even
at
his
extreme
age
to
understand
the
plucking
of
a
pigeon
as
well
or
better
than
any
man
in
alsatia
this
venerable
personage
was
an
usurer
of
notoriety
called
trapbois
and
had
very
lately
done
the
state
considerable
service
in
advancing
a
subsidy
necessary
to
secure
a
fresh
importation
of
liquors
to
the
cellars
the
at
the
vintry
being
scrupulous
to
deal
with
so
great
a
man
for
any
thing
but
ready
money
when
therefore
the
old
gentleman
arose
and
with
much
coughing
reminded
the
duke
that
he
had
a
poor
apartment
to
let
the
claims
of
all
others
were
set
aside
and
nigel
was
assigned
to
trapbois
as
his
guest
no
sooner
was
this
arrangement
made
than
lord
glenvarloch
expressed
to
lowestoffe
his
impatience
to
leave
this
discreditable
assembly
and
took
his
leave
with
a
careless
haste
which
but
for
the
rundlet
of
rhenish
wine
that
entered
just
as
he
left
the
apartment
might
have
been
taken
in
bad
part
the
young
templar
accompanied
his
friend
to
the
house
of
the
old
usurer
with
the
road
to
which
he
and
some
other
youngsters
about
the
temple
were
even
but
too
well
acquainted
on
the
way
he
assured
lord
glenvarloch
that
he
was
going
to
the
only
clean
house
in
whitefriars
a
property
which
it
owed
solely
to
the
exertions
of
the
old
man
only
daughter
an
elderly
damsel
ugly
enough
to
frighten
sin
yet
likely
to
be
wealthy
enough
to
tempt
a
puritan
so
soon
as
the
devil
had
got
her
old
dad
for
his
due
as
lowestoffe
spoke
thus
they
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
the
sour
stern
countenance
of
the
female
by
whom
it
was
opened
fully
confirmed
all
that
the
templar
had
said
of
the
hostess
she
heard
with
an
ungracious
and
discontented
air
the
young
templar
information
that
the
gentleman
his
companion
was
to
be
her
father
lodger
muttered
something
about
the
trouble
it
was
likely
to
occasion
but
ended
by
showing
the
stranger
apartment
which
was
better
than
could
have
been
augured
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
place
and
much
larger
in
extent
than
that
which
he
occupied
at
wharf
though
inferior
to
it
in
neatness
lowestoffe
having
thus
seen
his
friend
fairly
installed
in
his
new
apartment
and
having
obtained
for
him
a
note
of
the
rate
at
which
he
could
be
accommodated
with
victuals
from
a
neighbouring
cook
shop
now
took
his
leave
offering
at
the
same
time
to
send
the
whole
or
any
part
of
lord
glenvarloch
baggage
from
his
former
place
of
residence
to
his
new
lodging
nigel
mentioned
so
few
articles
that
the
templar
could
not
help
observing
that
his
lordship
it
would
seem
did
not
intend
to
enjoy
his
new
privileges
long
they
are
too
little
suited
to
my
habits
and
taste
that
i
should
do
so
replied
lord
glenvarloch
you
may
change
your
opinion
said
lowestoffe
and
so
i
wish
you
a
good
even
i
will
visit
you
the
morning
came
but
instead
of
the
templar
it
brought
only
a
letter
from
him
the
epistle
stated
that
lowestoffe
visit
to
alsatia
had
drawn
down
the
animadversions
of
some
crabbed
old
pantaloons
among
the
benchers
and
that
he
judged
it
wise
not
to
come
hither
at
present
for
fear
of
attracting
too
much
attention
to
lord
glenvarloch
place
of
residence
he
stated
that
he
had
taken
measures
for
the
safety
of
his
baggage
and
would
send
him
by
a
safe
hand
his
and
what
articles
he
wanted
then
followed
some
sage
advices
dictated
by
lowestoffe
acquaintance
with
alsatia
and
its
manners
he
advised
him
to
keep
the
usurer
in
the
most
absolute
uncertainty
concerning
the
state
of
his
to
throw
a
main
with
the
captain
who
was
in
the
habit
of
playing
and
paying
his
losses
with
three
vowels
and
finally
to
beware
of
duke
hildebrod
who
was
as
sharp
he
said
as
a
needle
though
he
had
no
more
eyes
than
are
possessed
by
that
necessary
implement
of
female
industry

which
dazzled

and
old

it
is

that
we
should
leave
our
hero
nigel
for
a
time
although
in
a
situation
neither
safe
comfortable
nor
creditable
in
order
to
detail
some
particulars
which
have
immediate
connexion
with
his
fortunes
it
was
but
the
third
day
after
he
had
been
forced
to
take
refuge
in
the
house
of
old
trapbois
the
noted
usurer
of
whitefriars
commonly
called
golden
trapbois
when
the
pretty
daughter
of
old
ramsay
the
watchmaker
after
having
piously
seen
her
father
finish
his
breakfast
from
the
fear
that
he
might
in
an
abstruse
fit
of
thought
swallow
the
instead
of
a
crust
of
the
brown
loaf
set
forth
from
the
house
as
soon
as
he
was
again
plunged
into
the
depth
of
calculation
and
accompanied
only
by
that
faithful
old
drudge
janet
the
scots
laundress
to
whom
her
whims
were
laws
made
her
way
to
lombard
street
and
disturbed
at
the
unusual
hour
of
eight
in
the
morning
aunt
judith
the
sister
of
her
worthy
godfather
the
venerable
maiden
received
her
young
visitor
with
no
great
complacency
for
naturally
enough
she
had
neither
the
same
admiration
of
her
very
pretty
countenance
nor
allowance
for
her
foolish
and
girlish
impatience
of
temper
which
master
george
heriot
entertained
still
mistress
margaret
was
a
favourite
of
her
brother
whose
will
was
to
aunt
judith
a
supreme
law
and
she
contented
herself
with
asking
her
untimely
visitor
what
she
made
so
early
with
her
pale
chitty
face
in
the
streets
of
london
i
would
speak
with
the
lady
hermione
answered
the
almost
breathless
girl
while
the
blood
ran
so
fast
to
her
face
as
totally
to
remove
the
objection
of
paleness
which
aunt
judith
had
made
to
her
complexion
with
the
lady
hermione
said
aunt
judith
with
the
lady
hermione
and
at
this
time
in
the
morning
when
she
will
scarce
see
any
of
the
family
even
at
seasonable
hours
you
are
crazy
you
silly
wench
or
you
abuse
the
indulgence
which
my
brother
and
the
lady
have
shown
to
indeed
indeed
i
have
not
repeated
margaret
struggling
to
retain
the
unbidden
tear
which
seemed
ready
to
burst
out
on
the
slightest
occasion
do
but
say
to
the
lady
that
your
brother
desires
earnestly
to
speak
to
her
and
i
know
she
will
not
refuse
to
see
aunt
judith
bent
an
earnest
suspicious
and
inquisitive
glance
on
her
young
visitor
you
might
make
me
your
secretary
my
lassie
she
said
as
well
as
the
lady
hermione
i
am
older
and
better
skilled
to
advise
i
live
more
in
the
world
than
one
who
shuts
herself
up
within
four
rooms
and
i
have
the
better
means
to
assist
o
no
no
no
said
margaret
eagerly
and
with
more
earnest
sincerity
than
complaisance
there
are
some
things
to
which
you
can
not
advise
me
aunt
judith
it
is
a
case
pardon
me
my
dear
aunt
a
case
beyond
your
i
am
glad
o
maiden
said
aunt
judith
somewhat
angrily
for
i
think
the
follies
of
the
young
people
of
this
generation
would
drive
mad
an
old
brain
like
mine
here
you
come
on
the
viretot
through
the
whole
streets
of
london
to
talk
some
nonsense
to
a
lady
who
scarce
sees
god
sun
but
when
he
shines
on
a
brick
wall
but
i
will
tell
her
you
are
she
went
away
and
shortly
returned
with
a
dry
miss
marget
the
lady
will
be
glad
to
see
you
and
that
more
my
young
madam
than
you
had
a
right
to
count
mistress
margaret
hung
her
head
in
silence
too
much
perplexed
by
the
train
of
her
own
embarrassed
thoughts
for
attempting
either
to
conciliate
aunt
judith
kindness
or
which
on
other
occasions
would
have
been
as
congenial
to
her
own
humour
to
retaliate
on
her
remarks
and
manner
she
followed
aunt
judith
therefore
in
silence
and
dejection
to
the
strong
oaken
door
which
divided
the
lady
hermione
apartments
from
the
rest
of
george
heriot
spacious
house
at
the
door
of
this
sanctuary
it
is
necessary
to
pause
in
order
to
correct
the
reports
with
which
richie
moniplies
had
filled
his
ear
respecting
the
singular
appearance
of
that
lady
attendance
at
prayers
whom
we
now
own
to
be
by
name
the
lady
hermione
some
part
of
these
exaggerations
had
been
communicated
to
the
worthy
scotsman
by
jenkin
vincent
who
was
well
experienced
in
the
species
of
wit
which
has
been
long
a
favourite
in
the
city
under
the
names
of
giving
the
dor
bamboozling
cramming
hoaxing
humbugging
and
quizzing
for
which
sport
richie
moniplies
with
his
solemn
gravity
totally
unapprehensive
of
a
joke
and
his
natural
propensity
to
the
marvellous
formed
an
admirable
subject
farther
ornaments
the
tale
had
received
from
richie
himself
whose
tongue
especially
when
oiled
with
good
liquor
had
a
considerable
tendency
to
amplification
and
who
failed
not
while
he
retailed
to
his
master
all
the
wonderful
circumstances
narrated
by
vincent
to
add
to
them
many
conjectures
of
his
own
which
his
imagination
had
converted
into
facts
yet
the
life
which
the
lady
hermione
had
led
for
two
years
during
which
she
had
been
the
inmate
of
george
heriot
house
was
so
singular
as
almost
to
sanction
many
of
the
wild
reports
which
went
abroad
the
house
which
the
worthy
goldsmith
inhabited
had
in
former
times
belonged
to
a
powerful
and
wealthy
baronial
family
which
during
the
reign
of
henry
terminated
in
a
dowager
lady
very
wealthy
very
devout
and
most
unalienably
attached
to
the
catholic
faith
the
chosen
friend
of
the
honourable
lady
foljambe
was
the
abbess
of
saint
roque
nunnery
like
herself
a
conscientious
rigid
and
devoted
papist
when
the
house
of
saint
roque
was
despotically
dissolved
by
the
fiat
of
the
impetuous
monarch
the
lady
foljambe
received
her
friend
into
her
spacious
mansion
together
with
two
vestal
sisters
who
like
their
abbess
were
determined
to
follow
the
tenor
of
their
vows
instead
of
embracing
the
profane
liberty
which
the
monarch
will
had
thrown
in
their
choice
for
their
residence
the
lady
foljambe
contrived
with
all
secrecy
for
henry
might
not
have
relished
her
interference
to
set
apart
a
suite
of
four
rooms
with
a
little
closet
fitted
up
as
an
oratory
or
chapel
the
whole
apartments
fenced
by
a
stout
oaken
door
to
exclude
strangers
and
accommodated
with
a
turning
wheel
to
receive
necessaries
according
to
the
practice
of
all
nunneries
in
this
retreat
the
abbess
of
saint
roque
and
her
attendants
passed
many
years
communicating
only
with
the
lady
foljambe
who
in
virtue
of
their
prayers
and
of
the
support
she
afforded
them
accounted
herself
little
less
than
a
saint
on
earth
the
abbess
fortunately
for
herself
died
before
her
munificent
patroness
who
lived
deep
in
queen
elizabeth
time
ere
she
was
summoned
by
fate
the
lady
foljambe
was
succeeded
in
this
mansion
by
a
sour
fanatic
knight
a
distant
and
collateral
relation
who
claimed
the
same
merit
for
expelling
the
priestess
of
baal
which
his
predecessor
had
founded
on
maintaining
the
votaresses
of
heaven
of
the
two
unhappy
nuns
driven
from
their
ancient
refuge
one
went
beyond
sea
the
other
unable
from
old
age
to
undertake
such
a
journey
died
under
the
roof
of
a
faithful
catholic
widow
of
low
degree
sir
paul
crambagge
having
got
rid
of
the
nuns
spoiled
the
chapel
of
its
ornaments
and
had
thoughts
of
altogether
destroying
the
apartments
until
checked
by
the
reflection
that
the
operation
would
be
an
unnecessary
expense
since
he
only
inhabited
three
rooms
of
the
large
mansion
and
had
not
therefore
the
slightest
occasion
for
any
addition
to
its
accommodations
his
son
proved
a
waster
and
a
prodigal
and
from
him
the
house
was
bought
by
our
friend
george
heriot
who
finding
like
sir
paul
the
house
more
than
sufficiently
ample
for
his
accommodation
left
the
foljambe
apartments
or
saint
roque
rooms
as
they
were
called
in
the
state
in
which
he
found
them
about
two
years
and
a
half
before
our
history
opened
when
heriot
was
absent
upon
an
expedition
to
the
continent
he
sent
special
orders
to
his
sister
and
his
directing
that
the
foljambe
apartments
should
be
fitted
up
handsomely
though
plainly
for
the
reception
of
a
lady
who
would
make
them
her
residence
for
some
time
and
who
would
live
more
or
less
with
his
own
family
according
to
her
pleasure
he
also
directed
that
the
necessary
repairs
should
be
made
with
secrecy
and
that
as
little
should
be
said
as
possible
upon
the
subject
of
his
letter
when
the
time
of
his
return
came
nigh
aunt
judith
and
the
household
were
on
the
of
impatience
master
george
came
as
he
had
intimated
accompanied
by
a
lady
so
eminently
beautiful
that
had
it
not
been
for
her
extreme
and
uniform
paleness
she
might
have
been
reckoned
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
on
earth
she
had
with
her
an
attendant
or
humble
companion
whose
business
seemed
only
to
wait
upon
her
this
person
a
reserved
woman
and
by
her
dialect
a
foreigner
aged
about
fifty
was
called
by
the
lady
monna
paula
and
by
master
heriot
and
others
mademoiselle
pauline
she
slept
in
the
same
room
with
her
patroness
at
night
ate
in
her
apartment
and
was
scarcely
ever
separated
from
her
during
the
day
these
females
took
possession
of
the
nunnery
of
the
devout
abbess
and
without
observing
the
same
rigorous
seclusion
according
to
the
letter
seemed
wellnigh
to
restore
the
apartments
to
the
use
to
which
they
had
been
originally
designed
the
new
inmates
lived
and
took
their
meals
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
with
the
domestics
lady
hermione
for
so
she
was
termed
held
no
communication
and
mademoiselle
pauline
only
such
as
was
indispensable
which
she
dispatched
as
briefly
as
possible
frequent
and
liberal
largesses
reconciled
the
servants
to
this
conduct
and
they
were
in
the
habit
of
observing
to
each
other
that
to
do
a
service
for
mademoiselle
pauline
was
like
finding
a
fairy
treasure
to
aunt
judith
the
lady
hermione
was
kind
and
civil
but
their
intercourse
was
rare
on
which
account
the
elder
lady
felt
some
pangs
both
of
curiosity
and
injured
dignity
but
she
knew
her
brother
so
well
and
loved
him
so
dearly
that
his
will
once
expressed
might
be
truly
said
to
become
her
own
the
worthy
citizen
was
not
without
a
spice
of
the
dogmatism
which
grows
on
the
best
disposition
when
a
word
is
a
law
to
all
around
master
george
did
not
endure
to
be
questioned
by
his
family
and
when
he
had
generally
expressed
his
will
that
the
lady
hermione
should
live
in
the
way
most
agreeable
to
her
and
that
no
inquiries
should
be
made
concerning
their
history
or
her
motives
for
observing
such
strict
seclusion
his
sister
well
knew
that
he
would
have
been
seriously
displeased
with
any
attempt
to
pry
into
the
secret
but
though
heriot
servants
were
bribed
and
his
sister
awed
into
silent
acquiescence
in
these
arrangements
they
were
not
of
a
nature
to
escape
the
critical
observation
of
the
neighbourhood
some
opined
that
the
wealthy
goldsmith
was
about
to
turn
papist
and
lady
foljambe
nunnery
others
that
he
was
going
mad
others
that
he
was
either
going
to
marry
or
to
do
worse
master
george
constant
appearance
at
church
and
the
knowledge
that
the
supposed
votaress
always
attended
when
the
prayers
of
the
english
ritual
were
read
in
the
family
liberated
him
from
the
first
of
these
suspicions
those
who
had
to
transact
business
with
him
upon
could
not
doubt
the
soundness
of
master
heriot
mind
and
to
confute
the
other
rumours
it
was
credibly
reported
by
such
as
made
the
matter
their
particular
interest
that
master
george
heriot
never
visited
his
guest
but
in
presence
of
mademoiselle
pauline
who
sat
with
her
work
in
a
remote
part
of
the
same
room
in
which
they
conversed
it
was
also
ascertained
that
these
visits
scarcely
ever
exceeded
an
hour
in
length
and
were
usually
only
repeated
once
a
week
an
intercourse
too
brief
and
too
long
interrupted
to
render
it
probable
that
love
was
the
bond
of
their
union
the
inquirers
were
therefore
at
fault
and
compelled
to
relinquish
the
pursuit
of
master
heriot
secret
while
a
thousand
ridiculous
tales
were
circulated
amongst
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
with
some
specimens
of
which
our
friend
richie
moniplies
had
been
as
we
have
seen
by
the
malicious
apprentice
of
worthy
david
ramsay
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
who
it
was
thought
could
if
she
would
have
said
more
of
the
lady
hermione
than
any
one
in
london
except
george
heriot
himself
and
that
was
the
said
david
ramsay
only
child
margaret
this
girl
was
not
much
past
the
age
of
fifteen
when
the
lady
hermione
first
came
to
england
and
was
a
very
frequent
visitor
at
her
godfather
who
was
much
amused
by
her
childish
sallies
and
by
the
wild
and
natural
beauty
with
which
she
sung
the
airs
of
her
native
country
spoilt
she
was
on
all
hands
by
the
indulgence
of
her
godfather
the
absent
habits
and
indifference
of
her
father
and
the
deference
of
all
around
to
her
caprices
as
a
beauty
and
as
an
heiress
but
though
from
these
circumstances
the
had
become
as
wilful
as
capricious
and
as
affected
as
unlimited
indulgence
seldom
fails
to
render
those
to
whom
it
is
extended
and
although
she
exhibited
upon
many
occasions
that
affectation
of
extreme
shyness
silence
and
reserve
which
misses
in
their
teens
are
apt
to
take
for
an
amiable
modesty
and
upon
others
a
considerable
portion
of
that
flippancy
which
youth
sometimes
confounds
with
wit
mistress
margaret
had
much
real
shrewdness
and
judgment
which
wanted
only
opportunities
of
observation
to
refine
it
a
lively
playful
disposition
and
an
excellent
heart
her
acquired
follies
were
much
increased
by
reading
plays
and
romances
to
which
she
devoted
a
great
deal
of
her
time
and
from
which
she
adopted
ideas
as
different
as
possible
from
those
which
she
might
have
obtained
from
the
invaluable
and
affectionate
instructions
of
an
excellent
mother
and
the
freaks
of
which
she
was
sometimes
guilty
rendered
her
not
unjustly
liable
to
the
charge
of
affectation
and
coquetry
but
the
little
lass
had
sense
and
shrewdness
enough
to
keep
her
failings
out
of
sight
of
her
godfather
to
whom
she
was
sincerely
attached
and
so
high
she
stood
in
his
favour
that
at
his
recommendation
she
obtained
permission
to
visit
the
recluse
lady
hermione
the
singular
mode
of
life
which
that
lady
observed
her
great
beauty
rendered
even
more
interesting
by
her
extreme
paleness
the
conscious
pride
of
being
admitted
farther
than
the
rest
of
the
world
into
the
society
of
a
person
who
was
wrapped
in
so
much
mystery
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
mind
of
margaret
ramsay
and
though
their
conversations
were
at
no
time
either
long
or
confidential
yet
proud
of
the
trust
reposed
in
her
margaret
was
as
secret
respecting
their
tenor
as
if
every
word
repeated
had
been
to
cost
her
life
no
inquiry
however
artfully
backed
by
flattery
and
insinuation
whether
on
the
part
of
dame
ursula
or
any
other
person
equally
inquisitive
could
wring
from
the
little
maiden
one
word
of
what
she
heard
or
saw
after
she
entered
these
mysterious
and
secluded
apartments
the
slightest
question
concerning
master
heriot
ghost
was
sufficient
at
her
gayest
moment
to
check
the
current
of
her
communicative
prattle
and
render
her
silent
we
mention
this
chiefly
to
illustrate
the
early
strength
of
character
a
strength
concealed
under
a
hundred
freakish
whims
and
humours
as
an
ancient
and
massive
buttress
is
disguised
by
its
fantastic
covering
of
ivy
and
wildflowers
in
truth
if
the
damsel
had
told
all
she
heard
or
saw
within
the
foljambe
apartments
she
would
have
said
but
little
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
inquirers
at
the
earlier
period
of
their
acquaintance
the
lady
hermione
was
wont
to
reward
the
attentions
of
her
little
friend
with
small
but
elegant
presents
and
entertain
her
by
a
display
of
foreign
rarities
and
curiosities
many
of
them
of
considerable
value
sometimes
the
time
was
passed
in
a
way
much
less
agreeable
to
margaret
by
her
receiving
lessons
from
pauline
in
the
use
of
the
needle
but
although
her
preceptress
practised
these
arts
with
a
dexterity
then
only
known
in
foreign
convents
the
pupil
proved
so
incorrigibly
idle
and
awkward
that
the
task
of
needlework
was
at
length
given
up
and
lessons
of
music
substituted
in
their
stead
here
also
pauline
was
excellently
qualified
as
an
instructress
and
margaret
more
successful
in
a
science
for
which
nature
had
gifted
her
made
proficiency
both
in
vocal
and
instrumental
music
these
lessons
passed
in
presence
of
the
lady
hermione
to
whom
they
seemed
to
give
pleasure
she
sometimes
added
her
own
voice
to
the
performance
in
a
pure
clear
stream
of
liquid
melody
but
this
was
only
when
the
music
was
of
a
devotional
cast
as
margaret
became
older
her
communications
with
the
recluse
assumed
a
different
character
she
was
allowed
if
not
encouraged
to
tell
whatever
she
had
remarked
out
of
doors
and
the
lady
hermione
while
she
remarked
the
quick
sharp
and
retentive
powers
of
observation
possessed
by
her
young
friend
often
found
sufficient
reason
to
caution
her
against
rashness
in
forming
opinions
and
giddy
petulance
in
expressing
them
the
habitual
awe
with
which
she
regarded
this
singular
personage
induced
mistress
margaret
though
by
no
means
delighting
in
contradiction
or
reproof
to
listen
with
patience
to
her
admonitions
and
to
make
full
allowance
for
the
good
intentions
of
the
patroness
by
whom
they
were
bestowed
although
in
her
heart
she
could
hardly
conceive
how
madame
hermione
who
never
stirred
from
the
foljambe
apartments
should
think
of
teaching
knowledge
of
the
world
to
one
who
walked
twice
between
temple
bar
and
lombard
street
besides
parading
in
the
park
every
sunday
that
proved
to
be
fair
weather
indeed
pretty
mistress
margaret
was
so
little
inclined
to
endure
such
remonstrances
that
her
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
foljambe
apartments
would
have
probably
slackened
as
her
circle
of
acquaintance
increased
in
the
external
world
had
she
not
on
the
one
hand
entertained
an
habitual
reverence
for
her
monitress
of
which
she
could
not
divest
herself
and
been
flattered
on
the
other
by
being
to
a
certain
degree
the
depository
of
a
confidence
for
which
others
thirsted
in
vain
besides
although
the
conversation
of
hermione
was
uniformly
serious
it
was
not
in
general
either
formal
or
severe
nor
was
the
lady
offended
by
flights
of
levity
which
mistress
margaret
sometimes
ventured
on
in
her
presence
even
when
they
were
such
as
made
monna
paula
cast
her
eyes
upwards
and
sigh
with
that
compassion
which
a
devotee
extends
towards
the
votaries
of
a
trivial
and
profane
world
thus
upon
the
whole
the
little
maiden
was
disposed
to
submit
though
not
without
some
wincing
to
the
grave
admonitions
of
the
lady
hermione
and
the
rather
that
the
mystery
annexed
to
the
person
of
her
monitress
was
in
her
mind
early
associated
with
a
vague
idea
of
wealth
and
importance
which
had
been
rather
confirmed
than
lessened
by
many
accidental
circumstances
which
she
had
noticed
since
she
was
more
capable
of
observation
it
frequently
happens
that
the
counsel
which
we
reckon
intrusive
when
offered
to
us
unasked
becomes
precious
in
our
eyes
when
the
pressure
of
difficulties
renders
us
more
diffident
of
our
own
judgment
than
we
are
apt
to
find
ourselves
in
the
hours
of
ease
and
indifference
and
this
is
more
especially
the
case
if
we
suppose
that
our
adviser
may
also
possess
power
and
inclination
to
back
his
counsel
with
effectual
assistance
mistress
margaret
was
now
in
that
situation
she
was
or
believed
herself
to
be
in
a
condition
where
both
advice
and
assistance
might
be
necessary
and
it
was
therefore
after
an
anxious
and
sleepless
night
that
she
resolved
to
have
recourse
to
the
lady
hermione
who
she
knew
would
readily
afford
her
the
one
and
as
she
hoped
might
also
possess
means
of
giving
her
the
other
the
conversation
between
them
will
best
explain
the
purport
of
the
visit
chapter
xix
by
this
good
light
a
wench
of
matchless
mettle
this
were
a
to
love
a
soldier
to
bind
his
wounds
and
kiss
his
bloody
brow
and
sing
a
roundel
as
she
help
to
arm
him
though
the
rough
foeman
drums
were
beat
so
nigh
they
seem
to
bear
the
burden
when
mistress
margaret
entered
the
foljambe
apartment
she
found
the
inmates
employed
in
their
usual
manner
the
lady
in
reading
and
her
attendant
in
embroidering
a
large
piece
of
tapestry
which
had
occupied
her
ever
since
margaret
had
been
first
admitted
within
these
secluded
chambers
hermione
nodded
kindly
to
her
visitor
but
did
not
speak
and
margaret
accustomed
to
this
reception
and
in
the
present
case
not
sorry
for
it
as
it
gave
her
an
interval
to
collect
her
thoughts
stooped
over
monna
paula
frame
and
observed
in
a
half
whisper
you
were
just
so
far
as
that
rose
monna
when
i
first
saw
you
see
there
is
the
mark
where
i
had
the
bad
luck
to
spoil
the
flower
in
trying
to
catch
the
stitch
i
was
little
above
fifteen
then
these
flowers
make
me
an
old
woman
monna
i
wish
they
could
make
you
a
wise
one
my
child
answered
monna
paula
in
whose
esteem
pretty
mistress
margaret
did
not
stand
quite
so
high
as
in
that
of
her
patroness
partly
owing
to
her
natural
austerity
which
was
something
intolerant
of
youth
and
gaiety
and
partly
to
the
jealousy
with
which
a
favourite
domestic
regards
any
one
whom
she
considers
as
a
sort
of
rival
in
the
affections
of
her
mistress
what
is
it
you
say
to
monna
little
one
asked
the
lady
nothing
madam
replied
mistress
margaret
but
that
i
have
seen
the
real
flowers
blossom
three
times
over
since
i
first
saw
monna
paula
working
in
her
canvass
garden
and
her
violets
have
not
budded
true
replied
hermione
but
the
buds
that
are
longest
in
blossoming
will
last
the
longest
in
flower
you
have
seen
them
in
the
garden
bloom
thrice
but
you
have
seen
them
fade
thrice
also
now
monna
paula
will
remain
in
blow
for
ever
they
will
fear
neither
frost
nor
true
madam
answered
mistress
margaret
but
neither
have
they
life
or
that
little
one
replied
the
recluse
is
to
compare
a
life
agitated
by
hope
and
fear
and
chequered
with
success
and
disappointment
and
fevered
by
the
effects
of
love
and
hatred
a
life
of
passion
and
of
feeling
saddened
and
shortened
by
its
exhausting
alternations
to
a
calm
and
tranquil
existence
animated
but
by
a
sense
of
duties
and
only
employed
during
its
smooth
and
quiet
course
in
the
unwearied
discharge
of
them
is
that
the
moral
of
your
answer
i
do
not
know
madam
answered
mistress
margaret
but
of
all
birds
in
the
air
i
would
rather
be
the
lark
that
sings
while
he
is
drifting
down
the
summer
breeze
than
the
weathercock
that
sticks
fast
yonder
upon
his
iron
perch
and
just
moves
so
much
as
to
discharge
his
duty
and
tell
us
which
way
the
wind
metaphors
are
no
arguments
my
pretty
maiden
said
the
lady
hermione
smiling
i
am
sorry
for
that
madam
answered
margaret
for
they
are
such
a
pretty
indirect
way
of
telling
one
mind
when
it
differs
from
betters
besides
on
this
subject
there
is
no
end
of
them
and
they
are
so
civil
and
becoming
indeed
replied
the
lady
let
me
hear
some
of
them
i
pray
it
would
be
for
example
very
bold
in
me
said
margaret
to
say
to
your
ladyship
that
rather
than
live
a
quiet
life
i
would
like
a
little
variety
of
hope
and
fear
and
liking
and
disliking
and
and
and
the
other
sort
of
feelings
which
your
ladyship
is
pleased
to
speak
of
but
i
may
say
freely
and
without
blame
that
i
like
a
butterfly
better
than
a
bettle
or
a
trembling
aspen
better
than
a
grim
scots
fir
that
never
wags
a
leaf
or
that
of
all
the
wood
brass
and
wire
that
ever
my
father
fingers
put
together
i
do
hate
and
detest
a
certain
huge
old
clock
of
the
german
fashion
that
rings
hours
and
half
hours
and
quarters
and
half
quarters
as
if
it
were
of
such
consequence
that
the
world
should
know
it
was
wound
up
and
going
now
dearest
lady
i
wish
you
would
only
compare
that
clumsy
clanging
piece
of
lumber
with
the
beautiful
timepiece
that
master
heriot
caused
my
father
to
make
for
your
ladyship
which
uses
to
play
a
hundred
merry
tunes
and
turns
out
when
it
strikes
the
hour
a
whole
band
of
morrice
dancers
to
trip
the
hays
to
the
and
which
of
these
timepieces
goes
the
truest
margaret
said
the
lady
i
must
confess
the
old
dutchman
has
the
advantage
in
that
said
margaret
i
fancy
you
are
right
madam
and
that
comparisons
are
no
arguments
at
least
mine
has
not
brought
me
upon
my
word
maiden
margaret
said
the
lady
smiling
you
have
been
of
late
thinking
very
much
of
these
perhaps
too
much
madam
said
margaret
so
low
as
only
to
be
heard
by
the
lady
behind
the
back
of
whose
chair
she
had
now
placed
herself
the
words
were
spoken
very
gravely
and
accompanied
by
a
half
sigh
which
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
her
to
whom
they
were
addressed
the
lady
hermione
turned
immediately
round
and
looked
earnestly
at
margaret
then
paused
for
a
moment
and
finally
commanded
monna
paula
to
carry
her
frame
and
embroidery
into
the
antechamber
when
they
were
left
alone
she
desired
her
young
friend
to
come
from
behind
the
chair
on
the
back
of
which
she
still
rested
and
sit
down
beside
her
upon
a
stool
i
will
remain
thus
madam
under
your
favour
answered
margaret
without
changing
her
posture
i
would
rather
you
heard
me
without
seeing
in
god
name
maiden
returned
her
patroness
what
is
it
you
can
have
to
say
that
may
not
be
uttered
face
to
face
to
so
true
a
friend
as
i
am
without
making
any
direct
answer
margaret
only
replied
you
were
right
dearest
lady
when
you
said
i
had
suffered
my
feelings
too
much
to
engross
me
of
late
i
have
done
very
wrong
and
you
will
be
angry
with
me
so
will
my
godfather
but
i
can
not
help
it
he
must
be
repeated
the
lady
with
emphasis
that
brief
little
word
does
indeed
so
far
explain
your
mystery
but
come
from
behind
the
chair
you
silly
popinjay
i
will
wager
you
have
suffered
yonder
gay
young
apprentice
to
sit
too
near
your
heart
i
have
not
heard
you
mention
young
vincent
for
many
a
day
perhaps
he
has
not
been
out
of
mouth
and
out
of
mind
both
have
you
been
so
foolish
as
to
let
him
speak
to
you
seriously
i
am
told
he
is
a
bold
not
bold
enough
to
say
any
thing
that
could
displease
me
madam
said
margaret
perhaps
then
you
were
displeased
said
the
lady
or
perhaps
he
has
not
which
would
be
wiser
and
better
be
my
love
your
godfather
will
soon
return
and
we
will
take
him
into
our
consultations
if
the
young
man
is
industrious
and
come
of
honest
parentage
his
poverty
may
be
no
such
insurmountable
obstacle
but
you
are
both
of
you
very
young
margaret
i
know
your
godfather
will
expect
that
the
youth
shall
first
serve
out
his
margaret
had
hitherto
suffered
the
lady
to
proceed
under
the
mistaken
impression
which
she
had
adopted
simply
because
she
could
not
tell
how
to
interrupt
her
but
pure
despite
at
hearing
her
last
words
gave
her
boldness
at
length
to
say
i
crave
your
pardon
madam
but
neither
the
youth
you
mention
nor
any
apprentice
or
master
within
the
city
of
london
margaret
said
the
lady
in
reply
the
contemptuous
tone
with
which
you
mention
those
of
your
own
class
many
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
whom
are
in
all
respects
better
than
yourself
and
would
greatly
honour
you
by
thinking
of
you
is
methinks
no
warrant
for
the
wisdom
of
your
choice
for
a
choice
it
seems
there
is
who
is
it
maiden
to
whom
you
have
thus
rashly
attached
yourself
rashly
i
fear
it
must
it
is
the
young
scottish
lord
glenvarloch
madam
answered
margaret
in
a
low
and
modest
tone
but
sufficiently
firm
considering
the
subject
the
young
lord
of
glenvarloch
repeated
the
lady
in
great
surprise
maiden
you
are
distracted
in
your
i
knew
you
would
say
so
madam
answered
margaret
it
is
what
another
person
has
already
told
me
it
is
perhaps
what
all
the
world
would
tell
me
it
is
what
i
am
sometimes
disposed
to
tell
myself
but
look
at
me
madam
for
i
will
now
come
before
you
and
tell
me
if
there
is
madness
or
distraction
in
my
look
and
word
when
i
repeat
to
you
again
that
i
have
fixed
my
affections
on
this
young
if
there
is
not
madness
in
your
look
or
word
maiden
there
is
infinite
folly
in
what
you
say
answered
the
lady
hermione
sharply
when
did
you
ever
hear
that
misplaced
love
brought
any
thing
but
wretchedness
seek
a
match
among
your
equals
margaret
and
escape
the
countless
kinds
of
risk
and
misery
that
must
attend
an
affection
beyond
your
why
do
you
smile
maiden
is
there
aught
to
cause
scorn
in
what
i
say
surely
no
madam
answered
margaret
i
only
smiled
to
think
how
it
should
happen
that
while
rank
made
such
a
wide
difference
between
creatures
formed
from
the
same
clay
the
wit
of
the
vulgar
should
nevertheless
jump
so
exactly
the
same
length
with
that
of
the
accomplished
and
the
exalted
it
is
but
the
variation
of
the
phrase
which
divides
them
dame
ursley
told
me
the
very
same
thing
which
your
ladyship
has
but
now
uttered
only
you
madam
talk
of
countless
misery
and
dame
ursley
spoke
of
the
gallows
and
mistress
turner
who
was
hanged
upon
indeed
answered
the
lady
hermione
and
who
may
dame
ursley
be
that
your
wise
choice
has
associated
with
me
in
the
difficult
task
of
advising
a
fool
the
barber
wife
at
next
door
madam
answered
margaret
with
feigned
simplicity
but
far
from
being
sorry
at
heart
that
she
had
found
an
indirect
mode
of
mortifying
her
monitress
she
is
the
wisest
woman
that
i
know
next
to
your
a
proper
confidant
said
the
lady
and
chosen
with
the
same
delicate
sense
of
what
is
due
to
yourself
and
others
but
what
ails
you
maiden
where
are
you
going
only
to
ask
dame
ursley
advice
said
margaret
as
if
about
to
depart
for
i
see
your
ladyship
is
too
angry
to
give
me
any
and
the
emergency
is
what
emergency
thou
simple
one
said
the
lady
in
a
kinder
sit
down
maiden
and
tell
me
your
tale
it
is
true
you
are
a
fool
and
a
pettish
fool
to
boot
but
then
you
are
a
child
an
amiable
child
with
all
your
folly
and
we
must
help
you
if
we
sit
down
i
say
as
you
are
desired
and
you
will
find
me
a
safer
and
wiser
counseller
than
the
and
tell
me
how
you
come
to
suppose
that
you
have
fixed
your
heart
unalterably
upon
a
man
whom
you
have
seen
as
i
think
but
i
have
seen
him
oftener
said
the
damsel
looking
down
but
i
have
only
spoken
to
him
once
i
should
have
been
able
to
get
that
once
out
of
my
head
though
the
impression
was
so
deep
that
i
could
even
now
repeat
every
trifling
word
he
said
but
other
things
have
since
riveted
it
in
my
bosom
for
maiden
replied
the
lady
is
the
word
which
comes
most
lightly
on
the
lips
in
such
circumstances
but
which
not
the
less
is
almost
the
last
that
we
should
use
the
fashion
of
this
world
its
passions
its
joys
and
its
sorrows
pass
away
like
the
winged
breeze
there
is
nought
for
ever
but
that
which
belongs
to
the
world
beyond
the
you
have
corrected
me
justly
madam
said
margaret
calmly
i
ought
only
to
have
spoken
of
my
present
state
of
mind
as
what
will
last
me
for
my
lifetime
which
unquestionably
may
be
but
and
what
is
there
in
this
scottish
lord
that
can
rivet
what
concerns
him
so
closely
in
your
fancy
said
the
lady
i
admit
him
a
personable
man
for
i
have
seen
him
and
i
will
suppose
him
courteous
and
agreeable
but
what
are
his
accomplishments
besides
for
these
surely
are
not
uncommon
he
is
unfortunate
madam
most
unfortunate
and
surrounded
by
snares
of
different
kinds
ingeniously
contrived
to
ruin
his
character
destroy
his
estate
and
perhaps
to
reach
even
his
life
these
schemes
have
been
devised
by
avarice
originally
but
they
are
now
followed
close
by
vindictive
ambition
animated
i
think
by
the
absolute
and
concentrated
spirit
of
malice
for
the
lord
dalgarno
here
monna
paula
monna
paula
exclaimed
the
lady
hermione
interrupting
her
young
friend
narrative
she
hears
me
not
she
answered
rising
and
going
out
i
must
seek
her
i
will
return
she
returned
accordingly
very
soon
after
you
mentioned
a
name
which
i
thought
was
familiar
to
me
she
said
but
monna
paula
has
put
me
right
i
know
nothing
of
your
lord
how
was
it
you
named
him
lord
dalgarno
said
margaret
the
wickedest
man
who
lives
under
pretence
of
friendship
he
introduced
the
lord
glenvarloch
to
a
with
the
purpose
of
engaging
him
in
deep
play
but
he
with
whom
the
perfidious
traitor
had
to
deal
was
too
virtuous
moderate
and
cautious
to
be
caught
in
a
snare
so
open
what
did
they
next
but
turn
his
own
moderation
against
him
and
persuade
others
that
because
he
would
not
become
the
prey
of
wolves
he
herded
with
them
for
a
share
of
their
booty
and
while
this
base
lord
dalgarno
was
thus
undermining
his
unsuspecting
countryman
he
took
every
measure
to
keep
him
surrounded
by
creatures
of
his
own
to
prevent
him
from
attending
court
and
mixing
with
those
of
his
proper
rank
since
the
gunpowder
treason
there
never
was
a
conspiracy
more
deeply
laid
more
basely
and
more
deliberately
the
lady
smiled
sadly
at
margaret
vehemence
but
sighed
the
next
moment
while
she
told
her
young
friend
how
little
she
knew
the
world
she
was
about
to
live
in
since
she
testified
so
much
surprise
at
finding
it
full
of
villainy
but
by
what
means
she
added
could
you
maiden
become
possessed
of
the
secret
views
of
a
man
so
cautious
as
lord
dalgarno
as
villains
in
general
are
permit
me
to
be
silent
on
that
subject
said
the
maiden
i
could
not
tell
you
without
betraying
others
let
it
suffice
that
my
tidings
are
as
certain
as
the
means
by
which
i
acquired
them
are
secret
and
sure
but
i
must
not
tell
them
even
to
you
are
too
bold
margaret
said
the
lady
to
traffic
in
such
matters
at
your
early
age
it
is
not
only
dangerous
but
even
unbecoming
and
i
knew
you
would
say
that
also
said
margaret
with
more
meekness
and
patience
than
she
usually
showed
on
receiving
reproof
but
god
knows
my
heart
acquits
me
of
every
other
feeling
save
that
of
the
wish
to
assist
this
most
innocent
and
betrayed
i
contrived
to
send
him
warning
of
his
friend
falsehood
alas
my
care
has
only
hastened
his
utter
ruin
unless
speedy
aid
be
found
he
charged
his
false
friend
with
treachery
and
drew
on
him
in
the
park
and
is
now
liable
to
the
fatal
penalty
due
for
breach
of
privilege
of
the
king
this
is
indeed
an
extraordinary
tale
said
hermione
is
lord
glenvarloch
then
in
prison
no
madam
thank
god
but
in
the
sanctuary
at
whitefriars
it
is
matter
of
doubt
whether
it
will
protect
him
in
such
a
case
they
speak
of
a
warrant
from
the
lord
chief
justice
a
gentleman
of
the
temple
has
been
arrested
and
is
in
trouble
for
having
assisted
him
in
his
even
his
taking
temporary
refuge
in
that
base
place
though
from
extreme
necessity
will
be
used
to
the
further
defaming
him
all
this
i
know
and
yet
i
can
not
rescue
him
can
not
rescue
him
save
by
your
by
my
means
maiden
said
the
lady
you
are
beside
yourself
what
means
can
i
possess
in
this
secluded
situation
of
assisting
this
unfortunate
nobleman
you
have
means
said
margaret
eagerly
you
have
those
means
unless
i
mistake
greatly
which
can
do
anything
can
do
everything
in
this
city
in
this
world
you
have
wealth
and
the
command
of
a
small
portion
of
it
will
enable
me
to
extricate
him
from
his
present
danger
he
will
be
enabled
and
directed
how
to
make
his
escape
and
i
she
paused
will
accompany
him
doubtless
and
reap
the
fruits
of
your
sage
exertions
in
his
behalf
said
the
lady
hermione
ironically
may
heaven
forgive
you
the
unjust
thought
lady
answered
margaret
i
will
never
see
him
more
but
i
shall
have
saved
him
and
the
thought
will
make
me
a
cold
conclusion
to
so
bold
and
warm
a
flame
said
the
lady
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
intimate
incredulity
it
is
however
the
only
one
which
i
expect
madam
i
could
almost
say
the
only
one
which
i
wish
i
am
sure
i
will
use
no
efforts
to
bring
about
any
other
if
i
am
bold
in
his
cause
i
am
timorous
enough
in
my
own
during
our
only
interview
i
was
unable
to
speak
a
word
to
him
he
knows
not
the
sound
of
my
voice
and
all
that
i
have
risked
and
must
yet
risk
i
am
doing
for
one
who
were
he
asked
the
question
would
say
he
has
long
since
forgotten
that
he
ever
saw
spoke
to
or
sat
beside
a
creature
of
so
little
signification
as
i
this
is
a
strange
and
unreasonable
indulgence
of
a
passion
equally
fanciful
and
dangerous
said
lady
hermione
you
will
assist
me
then
said
margaret
have
then
madam
my
secret
i
trust
is
safe
in
such
honourable
tarry
yet
a
little
said
the
lady
and
tell
me
what
resource
you
have
to
assist
this
youth
if
you
were
supplied
with
money
to
put
it
in
it
is
superfluous
to
ask
me
the
question
madam
answered
margaret
unless
you
purpose
to
assist
me
and
if
you
do
so
purpose
it
is
still
superfluous
you
could
not
understand
the
means
i
must
use
and
time
is
too
brief
to
but
have
you
in
reality
such
means
said
the
lady
i
have
with
the
command
of
a
moderate
sum
answered
margaret
ramsay
the
power
of
baffling
all
his
enemies
of
eluding
the
passion
of
the
irritated
king
the
colder
but
more
determined
displeasure
of
the
prince
the
vindictive
spirit
of
buckingham
so
hastily
directed
against
whomsoever
crosses
the
path
of
his
ambition
the
cold
concentrated
malice
of
lord
dalgarno
all
i
can
baffle
them
all
but
is
this
to
be
done
without
your
own
personal
risk
margaret
replied
the
lady
for
be
your
purpose
what
it
will
you
are
not
to
peril
your
own
reputation
or
person
in
the
romantic
attempt
of
serving
another
and
i
maiden
am
answerable
to
your
godfather
to
your
benefactor
and
my
own
not
to
aid
you
in
any
dangerous
or
unworthy
depend
upon
my
word
my
oath
dearest
lady
replied
the
supplicant
that
i
will
act
by
the
agency
of
others
and
do
not
myself
design
to
mingle
in
any
enterprise
in
which
my
appearance
might
be
either
perilous
or
i
know
not
what
to
do
said
the
lady
hermione
it
is
perhaps
incautious
and
inconsiderate
in
me
to
aid
so
wild
a
project
yet
the
end
seems
honourable
if
the
means
be
sure
what
is
the
penalty
if
he
fall
into
their
power
alas
alas
the
loss
of
his
right
hand
replied
margaret
her
voice
almost
stifled
with
sobs
are
the
laws
of
england
so
cruel
then
there
is
mercy
in
heaven
alone
said
the
lady
since
even
in
this
free
land
men
are
wolves
to
each
compose
yourself
margaret
and
tell
me
what
money
is
necessary
to
secure
lord
glenvarloch
two
hundred
pieces
replied
margaret
i
would
speak
to
you
of
restoring
them
and
i
must
one
day
have
the
power
only
that
i
know
that
is
i
think
your
ladyship
is
indifferent
on
that
not
a
word
more
of
it
said
the
lady
call
monna
paula
chapter
xx
credit
me
friend
it
hath
been
ever
thus
since
the
ark
rested
on
mount
ararat
false
man
hath
sworn
and
woman
hath
believed
repented
and
reproach
and
then
believed
once
more
new
by
the
time
that
margaret
returned
with
monna
paula
the
lady
hermione
was
rising
from
the
table
at
which
she
had
been
engaged
in
writing
something
on
a
small
slip
of
paper
which
she
gave
to
her
attendant
monna
paula
she
said
carry
this
paper
to
roberts
the
let
them
give
you
the
money
mentioned
in
the
note
and
bring
it
hither
monna
paula
left
the
room
and
her
mistress
proceeded
i
do
not
know
she
said
margaret
if
i
have
done
and
am
doing
well
in
this
affair
my
life
has
been
one
of
strange
seclusion
and
i
am
totally
unacquainted
with
the
practical
ways
of
this
world
an
ignorance
which
i
know
can
not
be
remedied
by
mere
i
fear
i
am
doing
wrong
to
you
and
perhaps
to
the
laws
of
the
country
which
affords
me
refuge
by
thus
indulging
you
and
yet
there
is
something
in
my
heart
which
can
not
resist
your
o
listen
to
it
listen
to
it
dear
generous
lady
said
margaret
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
and
grasping
those
of
her
benefactress
and
looking
in
that
attitude
like
a
beautiful
mortal
in
the
act
of
supplicating
her
tutelary
angel
the
laws
of
men
are
but
the
injunctions
of
mortality
but
what
the
heart
prompts
is
the
echo
of
the
voice
from
heaven
within
rise
rise
maiden
said
hermione
you
affect
me
more
than
i
thought
i
could
have
been
moved
by
aught
that
should
approach
me
rise
and
tell
me
whence
it
comes
that
in
so
short
a
time
your
thoughts
your
looks
your
speech
and
even
your
slightest
actions
are
changed
from
those
of
a
capricious
and
fanciful
girl
to
all
this
energy
and
impassioned
eloquence
of
word
and
action
i
am
sure
i
know
not
dearest
lady
said
margaret
looking
down
but
i
suppose
that
when
i
was
a
trifler
i
was
only
thinking
of
trifles
what
i
now
reflect
is
deep
and
serious
and
i
am
thankful
if
my
speech
and
manner
bear
reasonable
proportion
to
my
it
must
be
so
said
the
lady
yet
the
change
seems
a
rapid
and
strange
one
it
seems
to
be
as
if
a
childish
girl
had
at
once
shot
up
into
and
impassioned
woman
ready
to
make
exertions
alike
and
sacrifices
with
all
that
vain
devotion
to
a
favourite
object
of
affection
which
is
often
so
basely
the
lady
hermione
sighed
bitterly
and
monna
paula
entered
ere
the
conversation
proceeded
farther
she
spoke
to
her
mistress
in
the
foreign
language
in
which
they
frequently
conversed
but
which
was
unknown
to
margaret
we
must
have
patience
for
a
time
said
the
lady
to
her
visitor
the
is
abroad
on
some
business
but
he
is
expected
home
in
the
course
of
half
an
margaret
wrung
her
hands
in
vexation
and
impatience
minutes
are
precious
continued
the
lady
that
i
am
well
aware
of
and
we
will
at
least
suffer
none
of
them
to
escape
us
monna
paula
shall
remain
below
and
transact
our
business
the
very
instant
that
roberts
returns
she
spoke
to
her
attendant
accordingly
who
again
left
the
room
you
are
very
kind
madam
very
good
said
the
poor
little
margaret
while
the
anxious
trembling
of
her
lip
and
of
her
hand
showed
all
that
sickening
agitation
of
the
heart
which
arises
from
hope
deferred
be
patient
margaret
and
collect
yourself
said
the
lady
you
may
you
must
have
much
to
do
to
carry
through
this
your
bold
purpose
reserve
your
spirits
which
you
may
need
so
much
be
patient
it
is
the
only
remedy
against
the
evils
of
yes
madam
said
margaret
wiping
her
eyes
and
endeavouring
in
vain
to
suppress
the
natural
impatience
of
her
temper
i
have
heard
so
very
often
indeed
and
i
dare
say
i
have
myself
heaven
forgive
me
said
so
to
people
in
perplexity
and
affliction
but
it
was
before
i
had
suffered
perplexity
and
vexation
myself
and
i
am
sure
i
will
never
preach
patience
to
any
human
being
again
now
that
i
know
how
much
the
medicine
goes
against
the
you
will
think
better
of
it
maiden
said
the
lady
hermione
i
also
when
i
first
felt
distress
thought
they
did
me
wrong
who
spoke
to
me
of
patience
but
my
sorrows
have
been
repeated
and
continued
till
i
have
been
taught
to
cling
to
it
as
the
best
and
religious
duties
excepted
of
which
indeed
patience
forms
a
part
the
only
alleviation
which
life
can
afford
margaret
who
neither
wanted
sense
nor
feeling
wiped
her
tears
hastily
and
asked
her
patroness
forgiveness
for
her
petulance
i
might
have
thought
she
said
i
ought
to
have
reflected
that
even
from
the
manner
of
your
life
madam
it
is
plain
you
must
have
suffered
sorrow
and
yet
god
knows
the
patience
which
i
have
ever
seen
you
display
well
entitles
you
to
recommend
your
own
example
to
the
lady
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
replied
margaret
i
am
about
to
repose
a
high
confidence
in
you
you
are
no
longer
a
child
but
a
thinking
and
a
feeling
woman
you
have
told
me
as
much
of
your
secret
as
you
dared
i
will
let
you
know
as
much
of
mine
as
i
may
venture
to
tell
you
will
ask
me
perhaps
why
at
a
moment
when
your
own
mind
is
agitated
i
should
force
upon
you
the
consideration
of
my
sorrows
and
i
answer
that
i
can
not
withstand
the
impulse
which
now
induces
me
to
do
so
perhaps
from
having
witnessed
for
the
first
time
these
three
years
the
natural
effects
of
human
passion
my
own
sorrows
have
been
awakened
and
are
for
the
moment
too
big
for
my
own
bosom
perhaps
i
may
hope
that
you
who
seem
driving
full
sail
on
the
very
rock
on
which
i
was
wrecked
for
ever
will
take
warning
by
the
tale
i
have
to
tell
enough
if
you
are
willing
to
listen
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
who
the
melancholy
inhabitant
of
the
foljambe
apartments
really
is
and
why
she
resides
here
it
will
serve
at
least
to
while
away
the
time
until
monna
paula
shall
bring
us
the
reply
from
at
any
other
moment
of
her
life
margaret
ramsay
would
have
heard
with
undivided
interest
a
communication
so
flattering
in
itself
and
referring
to
a
subject
upon
which
the
general
curiosity
had
been
so
strongly
excited
and
even
at
this
agitating
moment
although
she
ceased
not
to
listen
with
an
anxious
ear
and
throbbing
heart
for
the
sound
of
monna
paula
returning
footsteps
she
nevertheless
as
gratitude
and
policy
as
well
as
a
portion
of
curiosity
dictated
composed
herself
in
appearance
at
least
to
the
strictest
attention
to
the
lady
hermione
and
thanked
her
with
humility
for
the
high
confidence
she
was
pleased
to
repose
in
her
the
lady
hermione
with
the
same
calmness
which
always
attended
her
speech
and
actions
thus
recounted
her
story
to
her
young
friend
my
father
she
said
was
a
merchant
but
he
was
of
a
city
whose
merchants
are
princes
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
noble
house
in
genoa
whose
name
stood
as
high
in
honour
and
in
antiquity
as
any
inscribed
in
the
golden
register
of
that
famous
aristocracy
my
mother
was
a
noble
scottish
woman
she
was
descended
do
not
start
and
not
remotely
descended
of
the
house
of
glenvarloch
no
wonder
that
i
was
easily
led
to
take
concern
in
the
misfortunes
of
this
young
lord
he
is
my
near
relation
and
my
mother
who
was
more
than
sufficiently
proud
of
her
descent
early
taught
me
to
take
an
interest
in
the
name
my
maternal
grandfather
a
cadet
of
that
house
of
glenvarloch
had
followed
the
fortunes
of
an
unhappy
fugitive
francis
earl
of
bothwell
who
after
showing
his
miseries
in
many
a
foreign
court
at
length
settled
in
spain
upon
a
miserable
pension
which
he
earned
by
conforming
to
the
catholic
faith
ralph
olifaunt
my
grandfather
separated
from
him
in
disgust
and
settled
at
barcelona
where
by
the
friendship
of
the
governor
his
heresy
as
it
was
termed
was
connived
at
my
father
in
the
course
of
his
commerce
resided
more
at
barcelona
than
in
his
native
country
though
at
times
he
visited
genoa
it
was
at
barcelona
that
he
became
acquainted
with
my
mother
loved
her
and
married
her
they
differed
in
faith
but
they
agreed
in
affection
i
was
their
only
child
in
public
i
conformed
to
the
docterins
and
ceremonial
of
the
church
of
rome
but
my
mother
by
whom
these
were
regarded
with
horror
privately
trained
me
up
in
those
of
the
reformed
religion
and
my
father
either
indifferent
in
the
matter
or
unwilling
to
distress
the
woman
whom
he
loved
overlooked
or
connived
at
my
secretly
joining
in
her
devotions
but
when
unhappily
my
father
was
attacked
while
yet
in
the
prime
of
life
by
a
slow
wasting
disease
which
he
felt
to
be
incurable
he
foresaw
the
hazard
to
which
his
widow
and
orphan
might
be
exposed
after
he
was
no
more
in
a
country
so
bigoted
to
catholicism
as
spain
he
made
it
his
business
during
the
two
last
years
of
his
life
to
realize
and
remit
to
england
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
which
by
the
faith
and
honour
of
his
correspondent
the
excellent
man
under
whose
roof
i
now
reside
was
employed
to
great
advantage
had
my
father
lived
to
complete
his
purpose
by
withdrawing
his
whole
fortune
from
commerce
he
himself
would
have
accompanied
us
to
england
and
would
have
beheld
us
settled
in
peace
and
honour
before
his
death
but
heaven
had
ordained
it
otherwise
he
died
leaving
several
sums
engaged
in
the
hands
of
his
spanish
debtors
and
in
particular
he
had
made
a
large
and
extensive
consignment
to
a
certain
wealthy
society
of
merchants
at
madrid
who
showed
no
willingness
after
his
death
to
account
for
the
proceeds
would
to
god
we
had
left
these
covetous
and
wicked
men
in
possession
of
their
booty
for
such
they
seemed
to
hold
the
property
of
their
deceased
correspondent
and
friend
we
had
enough
for
comfort
and
even
splendour
already
secured
in
england
but
friends
exclaimed
upon
the
folly
of
permitting
these
unprincipled
men
to
plunder
us
of
our
rightful
property
the
sum
itself
was
large
and
the
claim
having
been
made
my
mother
thought
that
my
father
memory
was
interested
in
its
being
enforced
especially
as
the
defences
set
up
for
the
mercantile
society
went
in
some
degree
to
impeach
the
fairness
of
his
transactions
we
went
therefore
to
madrid
i
was
then
my
margaret
about
your
age
young
and
thoughtless
as
you
have
hitherto
been
we
went
i
say
to
madrid
to
solicit
the
protection
of
the
court
and
of
the
king
without
which
we
were
told
it
would
be
in
vain
to
expect
justice
against
an
opulent
and
powerful
association
our
residence
at
the
spanish
metropolis
drew
on
from
weeks
to
months
for
my
part
my
natural
sorrow
for
a
kind
though
not
a
fond
father
having
abated
i
cared
not
if
the
lawsuit
had
detained
us
at
madrid
for
ever
my
mother
permitted
herself
and
me
rather
more
liberty
than
we
had
been
accustomed
to
she
found
relations
among
the
scottish
and
irish
officers
many
of
whom
held
a
high
rank
in
the
spanish
armies
their
wives
and
daughters
became
our
friends
and
companions
and
i
had
perpetual
occasion
to
exercise
my
mother
native
language
which
i
had
learned
from
my
infancy
by
degrees
as
my
mother
spirits
were
low
and
her
health
indifferent
she
was
induced
by
her
partial
fondness
for
me
to
suffer
me
to
mingle
occasionally
in
society
which
she
herself
did
not
frequent
under
the
guardianship
of
such
ladies
as
she
imagined
she
could
trust
and
particularly
under
the
care
of
the
lady
of
a
general
officer
whose
weakness
or
falsehood
was
the
original
cause
of
my
misfortunes
i
was
as
gay
margaret
and
thoughtless
i
again
repeat
it
as
you
were
but
lately
and
my
attention
like
yours
became
suddenly
riveted
to
one
object
and
to
one
set
of
feelings
the
person
by
whom
they
were
excited
was
young
noble
handsome
accomplished
a
soldier
and
a
briton
so
far
our
cases
are
nearly
parallel
but
may
heaven
forbid
that
the
parallel
should
become
complete
this
man
so
noble
so
fairly
formed
so
gifted
and
so
brave
this
villain
for
that
margaret
was
his
fittest
name
spoke
of
love
to
me
and
i
listened
i
suspect
his
sincerity
if
he
was
wealthy
noble
and
i
also
was
a
noble
and
an
opulent
heiress
it
is
true
that
he
neither
knew
the
extent
of
my
wealth
nor
did
i
communicate
to
him
i
do
not
even
remember
if
i
myself
knew
it
at
the
time
the
important
circumstance
that
the
greater
part
of
that
wealth
was
beyond
the
grasp
of
arbitrary
power
and
not
subject
to
the
precarious
award
of
arbitrary
judges
my
lover
might
think
perhaps
as
my
mother
was
desirous
the
world
at
large
should
believe
that
almost
our
whole
fortune
depended
on
the
precarious
suit
which
we
had
come
to
madrid
to
prosecute
a
belief
which
she
had
countenanced
out
of
policy
being
well
aware
that
a
knowledge
of
my
father
having
remitted
such
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
to
england
would
in
no
shape
aid
the
recovery
of
further
sums
in
the
spanish
courts
yet
with
no
more
extensive
views
of
my
fortune
than
were
possessed
by
the
public
i
believe
that
he
of
whom
i
am
speaking
was
at
first
sincere
in
his
pretensions
he
had
himself
interest
sufficient
to
have
obtained
a
decision
in
our
favour
in
the
courts
and
my
fortune
reckoning
only
what
was
in
spain
would
then
have
been
no
inconsiderable
sum
to
be
brief
whatever
might
be
his
motives
or
temptation
for
so
far
committing
himself
he
applied
to
my
mother
for
my
hand
with
my
consent
and
approval
my
mother
judgment
had
become
weaker
but
her
passions
had
become
more
irritable
during
her
increasing
illness
you
have
heard
of
the
bitterness
of
the
ancient
scottish
feuds
of
which
it
may
be
said
in
the
language
of
scripture
that
the
fathers
eat
sour
grapes
and
the
teeth
of
the
children
are
set
on
edge
unhappily
i
should
say
considering
what
this
man
has
now
shown
himself
to
be
some
such
strain
of
bitterness
had
divided
his
house
from
my
mother
and
she
had
succeeded
to
the
inheritance
of
hatred
when
he
asked
her
for
my
hand
she
was
no
longer
able
to
command
her
passions
she
raked
up
every
injury
which
the
rival
families
had
inflicted
upon
each
other
during
a
bloody
feud
of
two
centuries
heaped
him
with
epithets
of
scorn
and
rejected
his
proposal
of
alliance
as
if
it
had
come
from
the
basest
of
mankind
my
lover
retired
in
passion
and
i
remained
to
weep
and
murmur
against
fortune
and
i
will
confess
my
fault
against
my
affectionate
parent
i
had
been
educated
with
different
feelings
and
the
traditions
of
the
feuds
and
quarrels
of
my
mother
family
in
scotland
which
we
to
her
monuments
and
chronicles
seemed
to
me
as
insignificant
and
unmeaning
as
the
actions
and
fantasies
of
don
quixote
and
i
blamed
my
mother
bitterly
for
sacrificing
my
happiness
to
an
empty
dream
of
family
dignity
while
i
was
in
this
humour
my
lover
sought
a
renewal
of
our
intercourse
we
met
repeatedly
in
the
house
of
the
lady
whom
i
have
mentioned
and
who
in
levity
or
in
the
spirit
of
intrigue
countenanced
our
secret
correspondence
at
length
we
were
secretly
married
so
far
did
my
blinded
passion
hurry
me
my
lover
had
secured
the
assistance
of
a
clergyman
of
the
english
church
monna
paula
who
had
been
my
attendant
from
infancy
was
one
witness
of
our
union
let
me
do
the
faithful
creature
justice
she
conjured
me
to
suspend
my
purpose
till
my
mother
death
should
permit
us
to
celebrate
our
marriage
openly
but
the
entreaties
of
my
lover
and
my
own
wayward
passion
prevailed
over
her
remonstrances
the
lady
i
have
spoken
of
was
another
witness
but
whether
she
was
in
full
possession
of
my
secret
i
had
never
the
means
to
learn
but
the
shelter
of
her
name
and
roof
afforded
us
the
means
of
frequently
meeting
and
the
love
of
my
husband
seemed
as
sincere
and
as
unbounded
as
my
own
he
was
eager
he
said
to
gratify
his
pride
by
introducing
me
to
one
or
two
of
his
noble
english
friends
this
could
not
be
done
at
lady
d
but
by
his
command
which
i
was
now
entitled
to
consider
as
my
law
i
contrived
twice
to
visit
him
at
his
own
hotel
accompanied
only
by
monna
paula
there
was
a
very
small
party
of
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
there
was
music
mirth
and
dancing
i
had
heard
of
the
frankness
of
the
english
nation
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
bordered
on
license
during
these
entertainments
and
in
the
course
of
the
collation
which
followed
but
i
imputed
my
scruples
to
my
inexperience
and
would
not
doubt
the
propriety
of
what
was
approved
by
my
husband
i
was
soon
summoned
to
other
scenes
my
poor
mother
disease
drew
to
a
conclusion
happy
i
am
that
it
took
place
before
she
discovered
what
would
have
cut
her
to
the
soul
in
spain
you
may
have
heard
how
the
catholic
priests
and
particularly
the
monks
besiege
the
beds
of
the
dying
to
obtain
bequests
for
the
good
of
the
church
i
have
said
that
my
mother
temper
was
irritated
by
disease
and
her
judgment
impaired
in
proportion
she
gathered
spirits
and
force
from
the
resentment
which
the
priests
around
her
bed
excited
by
their
importunity
and
the
boldness
of
the
stern
sect
of
reformers
to
which
she
had
secretly
adhered
seemed
to
animate
her
dying
tongue
she
avowed
the
religion
she
had
so
long
concealed
renounced
all
hope
and
aid
which
did
not
come
by
and
through
its
dictates
rejected
with
contempt
the
ceremonial
of
the
romish
church
loaded
the
astonished
priests
with
reproaches
for
their
greediness
and
hypocrisy
and
commanded
them
to
leave
her
house
they
went
in
bitterness
and
rage
but
it
was
to
return
with
the
inquisitorial
power
its
warrants
and
its
officers
and
they
found
only
the
cold
corpse
left
of
her
on
whom
they
had
hoped
to
work
their
vengeance
as
i
was
soon
discovered
to
have
shared
my
mother
heresy
i
was
dragged
from
her
dead
body
imprisoned
in
a
solitary
cloister
and
treated
with
severity
which
the
abbess
assured
me
was
due
to
the
looseness
of
my
life
as
well
as
my
spiritual
errors
i
avowed
my
marriage
to
justify
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
i
implored
the
assistance
of
the
superior
to
communicate
my
situation
to
my
husband
she
smiled
coldly
at
the
proposal
and
told
me
the
church
had
provided
a
better
spouse
for
me
advised
me
to
secure
myself
of
divine
grace
hereafter
and
deserve
milder
treatment
here
by
presently
taking
the
veil
in
order
to
convince
me
that
i
had
no
other
resource
she
showed
me
a
royal
decree
by
which
all
my
estate
was
hypothecated
to
the
convent
of
saint
magdalen
and
became
their
complete
property
upon
my
death
or
my
taking
the
vows
as
i
was
both
from
religious
principle
and
affectionate
attachment
to
my
husband
absolutely
immovable
in
my
rejection
of
the
veil
i
believe
may
heaven
forgive
me
if
i
wrong
her
that
the
abbess
was
desirous
to
make
sure
of
my
spoils
by
hastening
the
former
event
it
was
a
small
and
a
poor
convent
and
situated
among
the
mountains
of
guadarrama
some
of
the
sisters
were
the
daughters
of
neighbouring
hidalgoes
as
poor
as
they
were
proud
and
ignorant
others
were
women
immured
there
on
account
of
their
vicious
conduct
the
superior
herself
was
of
a
high
family
to
which
she
owed
her
situation
but
she
was
said
to
have
disgraced
her
connexions
by
her
conduct
during
youth
and
now
in
advanced
age
covetousness
and
the
love
of
power
a
spirit
too
of
severity
and
cruelty
had
succeeded
to
the
thirst
after
licentious
pleasure
i
suffered
much
under
this
woman
and
still
her
dark
glassy
eye
her
tall
shrouded
form
and
her
rigid
features
haunt
my
slumbers
i
was
not
destined
to
be
a
mother
i
was
very
ill
and
my
recovery
was
long
doubtful
the
most
violent
remedies
were
applied
if
remedies
they
indeed
were
my
health
was
restored
at
length
against
my
own
expectation
and
that
of
all
around
me
but
when
i
first
again
beheld
the
reflection
of
my
own
face
i
thought
it
was
the
visage
of
a
ghost
i
was
wont
to
be
flattered
by
all
but
particularly
by
my
husband
for
the
fineness
of
my
complexion
it
was
now
totally
gone
and
what
is
more
extraordinary
it
has
never
returned
i
have
observed
that
the
few
who
now
see
me
look
upon
me
as
a
bloodless
phantom
such
has
been
the
abiding
effect
of
the
treatment
to
which
i
was
subjected
may
god
forgive
those
who
were
the
agents
of
it
i
thank
heaven
i
can
say
so
with
as
sincere
a
wish
as
that
with
which
i
pray
for
forgiveness
of
my
own
sins
they
now
relented
somewhat
towards
me
moved
perhaps
to
compassion
by
my
singular
appearance
which
bore
witness
to
my
sufferings
or
afraid
that
the
matter
might
attract
attention
during
a
visitation
of
the
bishop
which
was
approaching
one
day
as
i
was
walking
in
the
to
which
i
had
been
lately
admitted
a
miserable
old
moorish
slave
who
was
kept
to
cultivate
the
little
spot
muttered
as
i
passed
him
but
still
keeping
his
wrinkled
face
and
decrepit
form
in
the
same
angle
with
the
earth
is
heart
ease
near
the
postern
i
knew
something
of
the
symbolical
language
of
flowers
once
carried
to
such
perfection
among
the
moriscoes
of
spain
but
if
i
had
been
ignorant
of
it
the
captive
would
soon
have
caught
at
any
hint
which
seemed
to
promise
liberty
with
all
the
haste
consistent
with
the
utmost
circumspection
for
i
might
be
observed
by
the
abbess
or
some
of
the
sisters
from
the
window
i
hastened
to
the
postern
it
was
closely
barred
as
usual
but
when
i
coughed
slightly
i
was
answered
from
the
other
side
and
o
heaven
it
was
my
husband
voice
which
said
not
a
minute
here
at
present
but
be
on
this
spot
when
the
vesper
bell
has
tolled
i
retired
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
i
was
not
entitled
or
permitted
to
assist
at
vespers
but
was
accustomed
to
be
confined
to
my
cell
while
the
nuns
were
in
the
choir
since
my
recovery
they
had
discontinued
locking
the
door
though
the
utmost
severity
was
denounced
against
me
if
i
left
these
precincts
but
let
the
penalty
be
what
it
would
i
hastened
to
dare
no
sooner
had
the
last
toll
of
the
vesper
bell
ceased
to
sound
than
i
stole
from
my
chamber
reached
the
garden
unobserved
hurried
to
the
postern
beheld
it
open
with
rapture
and
in
the
next
moment
was
in
my
husband
arms
he
had
with
him
another
cavalier
of
noble
mien
both
were
masked
and
armed
their
horses
with
one
saddled
for
my
use
stood
in
a
thicket
hard
by
with
two
other
masked
horsemen
who
seemed
to
be
servants
in
less
than
two
minutes
we
were
mounted
and
rode
off
as
fast
as
we
could
through
rough
and
devious
roads
in
which
one
of
the
domestics
appeared
to
act
as
guide
the
hurried
pace
at
which
we
rode
and
the
anxiety
of
the
moment
kept
me
silent
and
prevented
my
expressing
my
surprise
or
my
joy
save
in
a
few
broken
words
it
also
served
as
an
apology
for
my
husband
silence
at
length
we
stopped
at
a
solitary
hut
the
cavaliers
dismounted
and
i
was
assisted
from
my
saddle
not
by
m
m
my
husband
i
would
say
who
seemed
busied
about
his
horse
but
by
the
stranger
into
the
hut
said
my
husband
your
dress
with
the
speed
of
lightning
you
will
find
one
to
you
we
must
forward
instantly
when
you
have
shifted
your
apparel
i
entered
the
hut
and
was
received
in
the
arms
of
the
faithful
monna
paula
who
had
waited
my
arrival
for
many
hours
half
distracted
with
fear
and
anxiety
with
her
assistance
i
speedily
tore
off
the
detested
garments
of
the
convent
and
exchanged
them
for
a
travelling
suit
made
after
the
english
fashion
i
observed
that
monna
paula
was
in
a
similar
dress
i
had
but
just
huddled
on
my
change
of
attire
when
we
were
hastily
summoned
to
mount
a
horse
i
found
was
provided
for
monna
paula
and
we
resumed
our
route
on
the
way
my
which
had
been
wrapped
hastily
together
around
a
stone
was
thrown
into
a
lake
along
the
verge
of
which
we
were
then
passing
the
two
cavaliers
rode
together
in
front
my
attendant
and
i
followed
and
the
servants
brought
up
the
rear
monna
paula
as
we
rode
on
repeatedly
entreated
me
to
be
silent
upon
the
road
as
our
lives
depended
on
it
i
was
easily
reconciled
to
be
passive
for
the
first
fever
of
spirits
which
attended
the
sense
of
liberation
and
of
gratified
affection
having
passed
away
i
felt
as
it
were
dizzy
with
the
rapid
motion
and
my
utmost
exertion
was
necessary
to
keep
my
place
on
the
saddle
until
we
suddenly
it
was
now
very
dark
saw
a
strong
light
before
us
my
husband
reined
up
his
horse
and
gave
a
signal
by
a
low
whistle
twice
repeated
which
was
answered
from
a
distance
the
whole
party
then
halted
under
the
boughs
of
a
large
and
my
husband
drawing
himself
close
to
my
side
said
in
a
voice
which
i
then
thought
was
only
embarrassed
by
fear
for
my
safety
must
now
part
those
to
whom
i
commit
you
are
contrabandists
who
only
know
you
as
but
who
for
a
high
bribe
have
undertaken
to
escort
you
through
the
passes
of
the
pyrenees
as
far
as
saint
jean
de
luz
do
you
not
go
with
us
i
exclaimed
with
emphasis
though
in
a
whisper
is
impossible
he
said
would
ruin
all
see
that
you
speak
in
english
in
these
people
hearing
and
give
not
the
least
sign
of
understanding
what
they
say
in
spanish
your
life
depends
on
it
for
though
they
live
in
opposition
to
and
evasion
of
the
laws
of
spain
they
would
tremble
at
the
idea
of
violating
those
of
the
church
i
see
them
coming
farewell
farewell
the
last
words
were
hastily
endeavoured
to
detain
him
yet
a
moment
by
my
feeble
grasp
on
his
cloak
will
meet
me
then
i
trust
at
saint
jean
de
luz
yes
he
answered
hastily
saint
jean
de
luz
you
will
meet
your
protector
he
then
extricated
his
cloak
from
my
grasp
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
his
companion
approached
kissed
my
hand
which
in
the
agony
of
the
moment
i
was
scarce
sensible
of
and
followed
my
husband
attended
by
one
of
the
the
tears
of
hermione
here
flowed
so
fast
as
to
threaten
the
interruption
of
her
narrative
when
she
resumed
it
it
was
with
a
kind
of
apology
to
margaret
every
circumstance
she
said
occurring
in
those
moments
when
i
still
enjoyed
a
delusive
idea
of
happiness
is
deeply
imprinted
in
my
remembrance
which
respecting
all
that
has
since
happened
is
waste
and
unvaried
as
an
arabian
desert
but
i
have
no
right
to
inflict
on
you
margaret
agitated
as
you
are
with
your
own
anxieties
the
unavailing
details
of
my
useless
margaret
eyes
were
full
of
tears
it
was
impossible
it
could
be
otherwise
considering
that
the
tale
was
told
by
her
suffering
benefactress
and
resembled
in
some
respects
her
own
situation
and
yet
she
must
not
be
severely
blamed
if
while
eagerly
pressing
her
patroness
to
continue
her
narrative
her
eye
involuntarily
sought
the
door
as
if
to
chide
the
delay
of
monna
paula
the
lady
hermione
saw
and
forgave
these
conflicting
emotions
and
she
too
must
be
pardoned
if
in
her
turn
the
minute
detail
of
her
narrative
showed
that
in
the
discharge
of
feelings
so
long
locked
in
her
own
bosom
she
rather
forgot
those
which
were
personal
to
her
auditor
and
by
which
it
must
be
supposed
margaret
mind
was
principally
occupied
if
not
entirely
engrossed
i
told
you
i
think
that
one
domestic
followed
the
gentlemen
thus
the
lady
continued
her
story
the
other
remained
with
us
for
the
purpose
as
it
seemed
of
introducing
us
to
two
persons
whom
m
i
say
whom
my
husband
signal
had
brought
to
the
spot
a
word
or
two
of
explanation
passed
between
them
and
the
servant
in
a
sort
of
which
i
did
not
understand
and
one
of
the
strangers
taking
hold
of
my
bridle
the
other
of
monna
paula
they
led
us
towards
the
light
which
i
have
already
said
was
the
signal
of
our
halting
i
touched
monna
paula
and
was
sensible
that
she
trembled
very
much
which
surprised
me
because
i
knew
her
character
to
be
so
strong
and
bold
as
to
border
upon
the
masculine
when
we
reached
the
fire
the
gipsy
figures
of
those
who
surrounded
it
with
their
swarthy
features
large
sombrero
hats
girdles
stuck
full
of
pistols
and
poniards
and
all
the
other
apparatus
of
a
roving
and
perilous
life
would
have
terrified
me
at
another
moment
but
then
i
only
felt
the
agony
of
having
parted
from
my
husband
almost
in
the
very
moment
of
my
rescue
the
females
of
the
gang
for
there
were
four
or
five
women
amongst
these
contraband
traders
received
us
with
a
sort
of
rude
courtesy
they
were
in
dress
and
manners
not
extremely
different
from
the
men
with
whom
they
associated
were
almost
as
hardy
and
adventurous
carried
arms
like
them
and
were
as
we
learned
from
passing
circumstances
scarce
less
experienced
in
the
use
of
them
it
was
impossible
not
to
fear
these
wild
people
yet
they
gave
us
no
reason
to
complain
of
them
but
used
us
on
all
occasions
with
a
kind
of
clumsy
courtesy
accommodating
themselves
to
our
wants
and
our
weakness
during
the
journey
even
while
we
heard
them
grumbling
to
each
other
against
our
effeminacy
like
some
rude
carrier
who
in
charge
of
a
package
of
valuable
and
fragile
ware
takes
every
precaution
for
its
preservation
while
he
curses
the
unwonted
trouble
which
it
occasions
him
once
or
twice
when
they
were
disappointed
in
their
contraband
traffic
lost
some
goods
in
a
rencontre
with
the
spanish
officers
of
the
revenue
and
were
finally
pursued
by
a
military
force
their
murmurs
assumed
a
more
alarming
tone
in
the
terrified
ears
of
my
attendant
and
myself
when
without
daring
to
seem
to
understand
them
we
heard
them
curse
the
insular
heretics
on
whose
account
god
saint
james
and
our
lady
of
the
pillar
had
blighted
their
hopes
of
profit
these
are
dreadful
recollections
why
then
dearest
lady
answered
margaret
will
you
thus
dwell
on
them
it
is
only
said
the
lady
hermione
because
i
linger
like
a
criminal
on
the
scaffold
and
would
fain
protract
the
time
that
must
inevitably
bring
on
the
final
catastrophe
yes
dearest
margaret
i
rest
and
dwell
on
the
events
of
that
journey
marked
as
it
was
by
fatigue
and
danger
though
the
road
lay
through
the
wildest
and
most
desolate
deserts
and
mountains
and
though
our
companions
both
men
and
women
were
fierce
and
lawless
themselves
and
exposed
to
the
most
merciless
retaliation
from
those
with
whom
they
were
constantly
engaged
yet
would
i
rather
dwell
on
these
hazardous
events
than
tell
that
which
awaited
me
at
saint
jean
de
but
you
arrived
there
in
safety
said
margaret
yes
maiden
replied
the
lady
hermione
and
were
guided
by
the
chief
of
our
outlawed
band
to
the
house
which
had
been
assigned
for
reception
with
the
same
punctilious
accuracy
with
which
he
would
have
delivered
a
bale
of
uncustomed
goods
to
a
correspondent
i
was
told
a
gentleman
had
expected
me
for
two
days
i
rushed
into
the
apartment
and
when
i
expected
to
embrace
my
husband
i
found
myself
in
the
arms
of
his
friend
the
villain
exclaimed
margaret
whose
anxiety
had
in
spite
of
herself
been
a
moment
suspended
by
the
narrative
of
the
lady
yes
replied
hermione
calmly
though
her
voice
somewhat
faltered
it
is
the
name
that
best
that
well
befits
him
he
margaret
for
whom
i
had
sacrificed
all
whose
love
and
whose
memory
were
dearer
to
me
than
my
freedom
when
i
was
in
the
convent
than
my
life
when
i
was
on
my
perilous
journey
had
taken
his
measures
to
shake
me
off
and
transfer
me
as
a
privileged
wanton
to
the
protection
of
his
libertine
friend
at
first
the
stranger
laughed
at
my
tears
and
my
agony
as
the
hysterical
passion
of
a
deluded
and
overreached
wanton
or
the
wily
affection
of
a
courtezan
my
claim
of
marriage
he
laughed
at
assuring
me
he
knew
it
was
a
mere
farce
required
by
me
and
submitted
to
by
his
friend
to
save
some
reserve
of
delicacy
and
expressed
his
surprise
that
i
should
consider
in
any
other
light
a
ceremony
which
could
be
valid
neither
in
spain
nor
england
and
insultingly
offered
to
remove
my
scruples
by
renewing
such
a
union
with
me
himself
my
exclamations
brought
monna
paula
to
my
aid
she
was
not
indeed
far
distant
for
she
had
expected
some
such
good
heaven
said
margaret
was
she
a
confidant
of
your
base
husband
no
answered
hermione
do
her
not
that
injustice
it
was
her
persevering
inquiries
that
discovered
the
place
of
my
confinement
it
was
she
who
gave
the
information
to
my
husband
and
who
remarked
even
then
that
the
news
was
so
much
more
interesting
to
his
friend
than
to
him
that
she
suspected
from
an
early
period
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
villain
to
shake
me
off
on
the
journey
her
suspicions
were
confirmed
she
had
heard
him
remark
to
his
companion
with
a
cold
sarcastic
sneer
the
total
change
which
my
prison
and
my
illness
had
made
on
my
complexion
and
she
had
heard
the
other
reply
that
the
defect
might
be
cured
by
a
touch
of
spanish
red
this
and
other
circumstances
having
prepared
her
for
such
treachery
monna
paula
now
entered
completely
possessed
of
herself
and
prepared
to
support
me
her
calm
representations
went
farther
with
the
stranger
than
the
expressions
of
my
despair
if
he
did
not
entirely
believe
our
tale
he
at
least
acted
the
part
of
a
man
of
honour
who
would
not
intrude
himself
on
defenceless
females
whatever
was
their
character
desisted
from
persecuting
us
with
his
presence
and
not
only
directed
monna
paula
how
we
should
journey
to
paris
but
furnished
her
with
money
for
the
purpose
of
our
journey
from
the
capital
i
wrote
to
master
heriot
my
most
trusted
correspondent
he
came
instantly
to
paris
on
receiving
the
letter
and
but
here
comes
monna
paula
with
more
than
the
sum
you
desired
take
it
my
dearest
maiden
serve
this
youth
if
you
will
but
o
margaret
look
for
no
gratitude
in
return
the
lady
hermione
took
the
bag
of
gold
from
her
attendant
and
gave
it
to
her
young
friend
who
threw
herself
into
her
arms
kissed
her
on
both
the
pale
cheeks
over
which
the
sorrows
so
newly
awakened
by
her
narrative
had
drawn
many
tears
then
sprung
up
wiped
her
own
overflowing
eyes
and
left
the
foljambe
apartments
with
a
hasty
and
resolved
step

to

of
benjamin
suddlechop
the
husband
of
the
active
and
efficient
dame
ursula
and
who
also
in
his
own
person
discharged
more
offices
than
one
for
besides
trimming
locks
and
beards
and
turning
whiskers
upward
into
the
martial
and
swaggering
curl
or
downward
into
the
drooping
form
which
became
mustaches
of
civil
policy
besides
also
occasionally
letting
blood
either
by
cupping
or
by
the
lancet
extracting
a
stump
and
performing
other
actions
of
petty
pharmacy

nearly
as
well
as

could
on
occasion

as
well
as
a

as
well
as
a
vein
and

draught
of
good
ale

trimmed

he
carried
on

trades
apart
from

his
barber
shop
projected
its
long
and
mysterious
pole
into
fleet
street
painted
to
represent
the
ribbons
with
which
in
elder
times
that
ensign
was
garnished
in
the
window
were
seen
rows
of
teeth
displayed
upon
strings
like
rosaries
cups
with
a
red
rag
at
the
bottom
to
resemble
blood
an
intimation
that
patients
might
be
bled
cupped
or
blistered
with
the
assistance
of
sufficient
advice
while
the
more
profitable
but
less
honourable
operations
upon
the
hair
of
the
head
and
beard
were
briefly
and
gravely
announced
within
was
the
leather
chair
for
customers
the
guitar
then
called
a
ghittern
or
cittern
with
which
a
customer
might
amuse
himself
till
his
predecessor
was
dismissed
from
under
benjamin
hands
and
which
therefore
often
flayed
the
ears
of
the
patient
metaphorically
while
his
chin
sustained
from
the
razor
literal
scarification
all
therefore
in
this
department
spoke
the
or
the
but
there
was
a
little
used
as
a
private
which
had
a
separate
entrance
by
a
dark
and
crooked
alley
which
communicated
with
fleet
street
after
a
circuitous
passage
through
several
and
courts
this
retired
temple
of
bacchus
had
also
a
connexion
with
benjamin
more
public
shop
by
a
long
and
narrow
entrance
conducting
to
the
secret
premises
in
which
a
few
old
topers
used
to
take
their
morning
draught
and
a
few
their
modicum
of
strong
waters
in
a
bashful
way
after
having
entered
the
barber
shop
under
pretence
of
being
shaved
besides
this
obscure
gave
a
separate
admission
to
the
apartments
of
dame
ursley
which
she
was
believed
to
make
use
of
in
the
course
of
her
multifarious
practice
both
to
let
herself
secretly
out
and
to
admit
clients
and
employers
who
cared
not
to
be
seen
to
visit
her
in
public
accordingly
after
the
hour
of
noon
by
which
time
the
modest
and
timid
whetters
who
were
benjamin
best
customers
had
each
had
his
draught
or
his
thimbleful
the
business
of
the
tap
was
in
a
manner
ended
and
the
charge
of
attending
the
passed
from
one
of
the
barber
apprentices
to
the
little
mulatto
girl
the
dingy
iris
of
dame
suddlechop
then
came
mystery
thick
upon
mystery
muffled
gallants
and
masked
females
in
disguises
of
different
fashions
were
seen
to
glide
through
the
intricate
mazes
of
the
alley
and
even
the
low
tap
on
the
door
which
frequently
demanded
the
attention
of
the
little
creole
had
in
it
something
that
expressed
secrecy
and
fear
of
discovery
it
was
the
evening
of
the
same
day
when
margaret
had
held
the
long
conference
with
the
lady
hermione
that
dame
suddlechop
had
directed
her
little
portress
to
keep
the
door
fast
as
a
miser
and
as
she
valued
her
saffron
skin
to
let
in
none
but
the
name
she
added
in
a
whisper
and
accompanied
it
with
a
nod
the
little
domestic
blinked
intelligence
went
to
her
post
and
in
brief
time
thereafter
admitted
and
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
dame
that
very
whose
clothes
sat
awkwardly
upon
him
and
who
had
behaved
so
doughtily
in
the
fray
which
befell
at
nigel
first
visit
to
beaujeu
ordinary
the
mulatto
introduced
him

fine
young
gentleman
all
over

then
muttered
to
herself
as
she
shut
the
door
fine
young

to
him
who
makes
the
it
was
indeed
we
are
sorry
to
say
it
and
trust
our
readers
will
sympathize
with
the
interest
we
take
in
the
matter
it
was
indeed
honest
jin
vin
who
had
been
so
far
left
to
his
own
devices
and
abandoned
by
his
better
angel
as
occasionally
to
travesty
himself
in
this
fashion
and
to
visit
in
the
dress
of
a
gallant
of
the
day
those
places
of
pleasure
and
dissipation
in
which
it
would
have
been
everlasting
discredit
to
him
to
have
been
seen
in
his
real
character
and
condition
that
is
had
it
been
possible
for
him
in
his
proper
shape
to
have
gained
admission
there
was
now
a
deep
gloom
on
his
brow
his
rich
habit
was
hastily
put
on
and
buttoned
awry
his
belt
buckled
in
a
most
disorderly
fashion
so
that
his
sword
stuck
outwards
from
his
side
instead
of
hanging
by
it
with
graceful
negligence
while
his
poniard
though
fairly
hatched
and
gilded
stuck
in
his
girdle
like
a
butcher
steel
in
the
fold
of
his
blue
apron
persons
of
fashion
had
by
the
way
the
advantage
formerly
of
being
better
distinguished
from
the
vulgar
than
at
present
for
what
the
ancient
farthingale
and
more
modern
hoop
were
to
court
ladies
the
sword
was
to
the
gentleman
an
article
of
dress
which
only
rendered
those
ridiculous
who
assumed
it
for
the
nonce

got
between
his
legs
and
as
he
stumbled
over
it
he
exclaimed
zounds
is
the
second
time
it
has
served
me
thus
i
believe
the
damned
trinket
knows
i
am
no
true
gentleman
and
does
it
of
set
come
come
mine
honest
jin
vin
come
my
good
boy
said
the
dame
in
a
soothing
tone
never
mind
these
trankums
a
frank
and
hearty
london
is
worth
all
the
gallants
of
the
inns
of
i
was
a
frank
and
hearty
london
before
i
knew
you
dame
suddlechop
said
vincent
what
your
advice
has
made
me
you
may
find
a
name
for
since
fore
george
i
am
ashamed
to
think
about
it
quoth
the
dame
and
is
it
even
so
with
thee
nay
then
i
know
but
one
cure
and
with
that
going
to
a
little
corner
cupboard
of
carved
wainscoat
she
opened
it
by
the
assistance
of
a
key
which
with
besides
hung
in
a
silver
chain
at
her
girdle
and
produced
a
long
flask
of
thin
glass
cased
with
wicker
bringing
forth
at
the
same
time
two
flemish
rummer
glasses
with
long
stalks
and
capacious
wombs
she
filled
the
one
brimful
for
her
guest
and
the
other
more
modestly
to
about
of
its
capacity
for
her
own
use
repeating
as
the
rich
cordial
trickled
forth
in
a
smooth
oily
stream
right
rosa
solis
as
ever
washed
mulligrubs
out
of
a
moody
brain
but
though
jin
vin
tossed
off
his
glass
without
scruple
while
the
lady
sippped
hers
more
moderately
it
did
not
appear
to
produce
the
expected
amendment
upon
his
humour
on
the
contrary
as
he
threw
himself
into
the
great
leathern
chair
in
which
dame
ursley
was
wont
to
solace
herself
of
an
evening
he
declared
himself
the
most
miserable
dog
within
the
sound
of
and
why
should
you
be
so
idle
as
to
think
yourself
so
silly
boy
said
dame
suddlechop
but
is
always
thus
fools
and
children
never
know
when
they
are
well
why
there
is
not
one
that
walks
in
paul
whether
in
flat
cap
or
hat
and
feather
that
has
so
many
kind
glances
from
the
wenches
as
you
when
ye
swagger
along
fleet
street
with
your
bat
under
your
arm
and
your
cap
set
aside
upon
your
head
thou
knowest
well
that
from
deputy
self
down
to
the
in
the
alley
all
of
them
are
twiring
and
peeping
betwixt
their
fingers
when
you
pass
and
yet
you
call
yourself
a
miserable
dog
and
i
must
tell
you
all
this
over
and
over
again
as
if
i
were
whistling
the
chimes
of
london
to
a
pettish
child
in
order
to
bring
the
pretty
baby
into
the
flattery
of
dame
ursula
seemed
to
have
the
fate
of
her
cordial
it
was
swallowed
indeed
by
the
party
to
whom
she
presented
it
and
that
with
some
degree
of
relish
but
it
did
not
operate
as
a
sedative
on
the
disturbed
state
of
the
youth
mind
he
laughed
for
an
instant
half
in
scorn
and
half
in
gratified
vanity
but
cast
a
sullen
look
on
dame
ursley
as
he
replied
to
her
last
words
you
do
treat
me
like
a
child
indeed
when
you
sing
over
and
over
to
me
a
cuckoo
song
that
i
care
not
a
aha
said
dame
ursley
that
is
to
say
you
care
not
if
you
please
all
unless
you
please
one
you
are
a
true
lover
i
warrant
and
care
not
for
all
the
city
from
here
to
whitechapel
so
you
could
write
yourself
first
in
your
pretty
well
well
take
patience
man
and
be
guided
by
me
for
i
will
be
the
hoop
will
bind
you
together
at
it
is
time
you
were
so
said
jenkin
for
hitherto
you
have
rather
been
the
wedge
to
separate
dame
suddlechop
had
by
this
time
finished
her
cordial
it
was
not
the
first
she
had
taken
that
day
and
though
a
woman
of
strong
brain
and
cautious
at
least
if
not
abstemious
in
her
potations
it
may
nevertheless
be
supposed
that
her
patience
was
not
improved
by
the
regimen
which
she
observed
why
thou
ungracious
and
ingrate
knave
said
dame
ursley
have
not
i
done
every
thing
to
put
thee
in
thy
mistress
good
graces
she
loves
gentry
the
proud
scottish
minx
as
a
welshman
loves
cheese
and
has
her
father
descent
from
that
duke
of
daldevil
or
whatsoever
she
calls
him
as
close
in
her
heart
as
gold
in
a
miser
chest
though
she
as
seldom
shows
it
and
none
she
will
think
of
or
have
but
a
gentleman
and
a
gentleman
i
have
made
of
thee
jin
vin
the
devil
can
not
deny
you
have
made
a
fool
of
me
said
poor
jenkin
looking
at
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
never
the
worse
gentleman
for
that
said
dame
ursley
laughing
and
what
is
worse
said
he
turning
his
back
to
her
suddenly
and
writhing
in
his
chair
you
have
made
a
rogue
of
never
the
worse
gentleman
for
that
neither
said
dame
ursley
in
the
same
tone
let
a
man
bear
his
folly
gaily
and
his
knavery
stoutly
and
let
me
see
if
gravity
or
honesty
will
look
him
in
the
face
tut
man
it
was
only
in
the
time
of
king
arthur
or
king
lud
that
a
gentleman
was
held
to
blemish
his
scutcheon
by
a
leap
over
the
line
of
reason
or
honesty
it
is
the
bold
look
the
ready
hand
the
fine
clothes
the
brisk
oath
and
the
wild
brain
that
makes
the
gallant
i
know
what
you
have
made
me
said
jin
vin
since
i
have
given
up
skittles
and
for
tennis
and
bowls
good
english
ale
for
thin
bordeaux
and
sour
rhenish
and
pudding
for

and

my

i
think
whose
advice
has
guided
me
in
all
this
whose
advice
then
whose
advice
then
speak
out
thou
poor
petty
and
say
who
advised
thee
retorted
dame
ursley
flushed
and
indignant
marry
come
up
my
paltry
companion
say
by
whose
advice
you
have
made
a
gamester
of
yourself
and
a
thief
besides
as
your
words
would
bear
the
lord
deliver
us
from
evil
and
here
dame
ursley
devoutly
crossed
herself
hark
ye
dame
ursley
suddlechop
said
jenkin
starting
up
his
dark
eyes
flashing
with
anger
remember
i
am
none
of
your
husband
and
if
i
were
you
would
do
well
not
to
forget
whose
threshold
was
swept
when
they
last
rode
the
skimmington
footnote
a
species
of
triumphal
procession
in
honour
of
female
supremacy
when
it
rose
to
such
a
height
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
neighbourhood
it
is
described
at
full
length
in
hudibras
part
ii
canto
ii
as
the
procession
passed
on
those
who
attended
it
in
an
official
capacity
were
wont
to
sweep
the
threshold
of
the
houses
in
which
fame
affirmed
the
mistresses
to
exercise
paramount
authority
which
was
given
and
received
as
a
hint
that
their
inmates
might
in
their
turn
be
made
the
subject
of
a
similar
ovation
the
skimmington
which
in
some
degree
resembled
the
proceedings
of
mumbo
jumbo
in
an
african
village
has
been
long
discontinued
in
england
apparently
because
female
rule
has
become
either
milder
or
less
frequent
than
among
our
ancestors
upon
such
another
scolding
jade
as
i
hope
to
see
you
ride
up
holborn
next
said
dame
ursley
provoked
out
of
all
her
holiday
and
expressions
with
a
nosegay
at
your
breast
and
a
parson
at
your
elbow
that
may
well
be
answered
jin
vin
bitterly
if
i
walk
by
your
counsels
as
i
have
begun
by
them
but
before
that
day
comes
you
shall
know
that
jin
vin
has
the
brisk
boys
of
fleet
street
still
at
his
yes
you
jade
you
shall
be
carted
for
bawd
and
conjurer
in
grain
and
bing
off
to
bridewell
with
every
brass
basin
betwixt
the
bar
and
paul
beating
before
you
as
if
the
devil
were
banging
them
with
his
dame
ursley
coloured
like
scarlet
seized
upon
the
flask
of
cordial
and
seemed
by
her
first
gesture
about
to
hurl
it
at
the
head
of
her
adversary
but
suddenly
and
as
if
by
a
strong
internal
effort
she
checked
her
outrageous
resentment
and
putting
the
bottle
to
its
more
legitimate
use
filled
with
wonderful
composure
the
two
glasses
and
taking
up
one
of
them
said
with
a
smile
which
better
became
her
comely
and
jovial
countenance
than
the
fury
by
which
it
was
animated
the
moment
before
here
is
to
thee
jin
vin
my
lad
in
all
loving
kindness
whatever
spite
thou
bearest
to
me
that
have
always
been
a
mother
to
jenkin
english
could
not
resist
this
forcible
appeal
he
took
up
the
other
glass
and
lovingly
pledged
the
dame
in
her
cup
of
reconciliation
and
proceeded
to
make
a
kind
of
grumbling
apology
for
his
own
violence
for
you
know
he
said
it
was
you
persuaded
me
to
get
these
fine
things
and
go
to
that
godless
ordinary
and
ruffle
it
with
the
best
and
bring
you
home
all
the
news
and
you
said
i
that
was
the
cock
of
the
ward
would
soon
be
the
cock
of
the
ordinary
and
would
win
ten
times
as
much
at
gleek
and
primero
as
i
used
to
do
at
put
and
and
turn
up
doublets
with
the
dice
as
busily
as
i
was
wont
to
trowl
down
the
ninepins
in
the
and
then
you
said
i
should
bring
you
such
news
out
of
the
ordinary
as
should
make
us
all
when
used
as
you
knew
how
to
use
it
and
now
you
see
what
is
to
come
of
it
all
is
all
true
thou
sayest
lad
said
the
dame
but
thou
must
have
patience
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
you
can
not
become
used
to
your
in
a
month
time
any
more
than
when
you
changed
your
long
coat
for
a
doublet
and
hose
and
in
gaming
you
must
expect
to
lose
as
well
as
gain
is
the
sitting
gamester
sweeps
the
the
board
has
swept
me
i
know
replied
jin
vin
and
that
pretty
clean
i
would
that
were
the
worst
but
i
owe
for
all
this
finery
and
is
coming
on
and
my
master
will
find
my
accompt
worse
than
it
should
be
by
a
score
of
pieces
my
old
father
will
be
called
in
to
make
them
good
and
i
may
save
the
hangman
a
labour
and
do
the
job
myself
or
go
the
virginia
do
not
speak
so
loud
my
dear
boy
said
dame
ursley
but
tell
me
why
you
borrow
not
from
a
friend
to
make
up
your
arrear
you
could
lend
him
as
much
when
his
came
no
no
i
have
had
enough
of
that
work
said
vincent
tunstall
would
lend
me
the
money
poor
fellow
an
he
had
it
but
his
gentle
beggarly
kindred
plunder
him
of
all
and
keep
him
as
bare
as
a
birch
at
christmas
no
my
fortune
may
be
spelt
in
four
letters
and
these
read
now
hush
you
simple
craven
said
the
dame
did
you
never
hear
that
when
the
need
is
highest
the
help
is
nighest
we
may
find
aid
for
you
yet
and
sooner
than
you
are
aware
of
i
am
sure
i
would
never
have
advised
you
to
such
a
course
but
only
you
had
set
heart
and
eye
on
pretty
mistress
marget
and
less
would
not
serve
you
and
what
could
i
do
but
advise
you
to
cast
your
and
try
your
luck
where
folks
find
fortune
ay
ay
i
remember
your
counsel
well
said
jenkin
i
was
to
be
introduced
to
her
by
you
when
i
was
perfect
in
my
gallantries
and
as
rich
as
the
king
and
then
she
was
to
be
surprised
to
find
i
was
poor
jin
vin
that
used
to
watch
from
matin
to
curfew
for
one
glance
of
her
eye
and
now
instead
of
that
she
has
set
her
soul
on
this
scottish
of
a
lord
that
won
my
last
tester
and
be
cursed
to
him
and
so
i
am
bankrupt
in
love
fortune
and
character
before
i
am
out
of
my
time
and
all
along
of
you
mother
do
not
call
me
out
of
my
own
name
my
dear
boy
jin
vin
answered
ursula
in
a
tone
betwixt
rage
and
coaxing
do
not
because
i
am
no
saint
but
a
poor
sinful
woman
with
no
more
patience
than
she
needs
to
carry
her
through
a
thousand
crosses
and
if
i
have
done
you
wrong
by
evil
counsel
i
must
mend
it
and
put
you
right
by
good
advice
and
for
the
score
of
pieces
that
must
be
made
up
at
why
here
is
in
a
good
green
purse
as
much
as
will
make
that
matter
good
and
we
will
get
old
crosspatch
the
tailor
to
take
a
long
day
for
your
clothes
and
mother
are
you
serious
said
jin
vin
unable
to
trust
either
his
eyes
or
his
ears
in
troth
am
i
said
the
dame
and
will
you
call
me
mother
midnight
now
jin
vin
mother
midnight
exclaimed
jenkin
hugging
the
dame
in
his
transport
and
bestowing
on
her
still
comely
cheek
a
hearty
and
not
unacceptable
smack
that
sounded
like
the
report
of
a
pistol
mother
midday
rather
that
has
risen
to
light
me
out
of
my
troubles
a
mother
more
dear
than
she
who
bore
me
for
she
poor
soul
only
brought
me
into
a
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
and
your
timely
aid
has
helped
me
out
of
the
one
and
the
and
the
fellow
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
fairly
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
you
would
not
have
me
be
made
to
ride
the
skimmington
then
said
the
dame
or
parade
me
in
a
cart
with
all
the
brass
basins
of
the
ward
beating
the
march
to
bridewell
before
me
i
would
sooner
be
carted
to
tyburn
myself
replied
the
penitent
why
then
sit
up
like
a
man
and
wipe
thine
eyes
and
if
thou
art
pleased
with
what
i
have
done
i
will
show
thee
how
thou
mayst
requite
me
in
the
highest
how
said
jenkin
vincent
sitting
straight
up
in
his
you
would
have
me
then
do
you
some
service
for
this
friendship
of
yours
ay
marry
would
i
said
dame
ursley
for
you
are
to
know
that
though
i
am
right
glad
to
stead
you
with
it
this
gold
is
not
mine
but
was
placed
in
my
hands
in
order
to
find
a
trusty
agent
for
a
certain
purpose
and
so
but
what
the
matter
with
you
are
you
fool
enough
to
be
angry
because
you
can
not
get
a
purse
of
gold
for
nothing
i
would
i
knew
where
such
were
to
come
by
i
never
could
find
them
lying
in
my
road
i
promise
no
no
dame
said
poor
jenkin
it
is
not
for
that
for
look
you
i
would
rather
work
these
ten
bones
to
the
knuckles
and
live
by
my
labour
but
and
here
he
paused
but
what
man
said
dame
ursley
you
are
willing
to
work
for
what
you
want
and
yet
when
i
offer
you
gold
for
the
winning
you
look
on
me
as
the
devil
looks
over
it
is
ill
talking
of
the
devil
mother
said
jenkin
i
had
him
even
now
in
my
head
for
look
you
i
am
at
that
pass
when
they
say
he
will
appear
to
wretched
ruined
creatures
and
proffer
them
gold
for
the
of
their
salvation
but
i
have
been
trying
these
two
days
to
bring
my
mind
strongly
up
to
the
thought
that
i
will
rather
sit
down
in
shame
and
sin
and
sorrow
as
i
am
like
to
do
than
hold
on
in
ill
courses
to
get
rid
of
my
present
straits
and
so
take
care
dame
ursula
how
you
tempt
me
to
break
such
a
good
i
tempt
you
to
nothing
young
man
answered
ursula
and
as
i
perceive
you
are
too
wilful
to
be
wise
i
will
put
my
purse
in
my
pocket
and
look
out
for
some
one
that
will
work
my
turn
with
better
will
and
more
thankfulness
and
you
may
go
your
own
course
break
your
indenture
ruin
your
father
lose
your
character
and
bid
pretty
mistress
margaret
farewell
for
ever
and
a
stay
stay
said
jenkin
the
woman
is
in
as
great
a
hurry
as
a
brown
baker
when
his
oven
is
overheated
first
let
me
hear
that
which
you
have
to
propose
to
why
after
all
it
is
but
to
get
a
gentleman
of
rank
and
fortune
who
is
in
trouble
carried
in
secret
down
the
river
as
far
as
the
isle
of
dogs
or
somewhere
thereabout
where
he
may
lie
concealed
until
he
can
escape
aboard
i
know
thou
knowest
every
place
by
the
river
side
as
well
as
the
devil
knows
an
usurer
or
the
beggar
knows
his
a
plague
of
your
similes
dame
replied
the
apprentice
for
the
devil
gave
me
that
knowledge
and
beggary
may
be
the
end
but
what
has
this
gentleman
done
that
he
should
need
to
be
under
hiding
no
papist
i
hope
no
catesby
and
piercy
business
no
gunpowder
plot
fy
fy
what
do
you
take
me
for
said
dame
ursula
i
am
as
good
a
churchwoman
as
the
parson
wife
save
that
necessary
business
will
not
allow
me
to
go
there
oftener
than
on
heaven
help
me
no
no
this
is
no
popish
matter
the
gentleman
hath
but
struck
another
in
the
park
ha
what
said
vincent
interrupting
her
with
a
start
ay
ay
i
see
you
guess
whom
i
mean
it
is
even
he
we
have
spoken
of
so
often
just
lord
glenvarloch
and
no
one
vincent
sprung
from
his
seat
and
traversed
the
room
with
rapid
and
disorderly
steps
there
there
it
is
now
you
are
always
ice
or
gunpowder
you
sit
in
the
great
leathern
armchair
as
quiet
as
a
rocket
hangs
upon
the
frame
in
a
till
the
match
be
fired
and
then
whizz
you
are
in
the
third
heaven
beyond
the
reach
of
the
human
voice
eye
or
when
you
have
wearied
yourself
with
padding
to
and
fro
across
the
room
will
you
tell
me
your
determination
for
time
presses
will
you
aid
me
in
this
matter
or
not
no
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
replied
jenkin
have
you
not
confessed
to
me
that
margaret
loves
him
ay
answered
the
dame
that
she
thinks
she
does
but
that
will
not
last
and
have
i
not
told
you
but
this
instant
replied
jenkin
that
it
was
this
same
glenvarloch
that
rooked
me
at
the
ordinary
of
every
penny
i
had
and
made
a
knave
of
me
to
boot
by
gaining
more
than
was
my
own
o
that
cursed
gold
which
shortyard
the
mercer
paid
me
that
morning
on
accompt
for
mending
the
clock
of
saint
stephen
if
i
had
not
by
ill
chance
had
that
about
me
i
could
but
have
beggared
my
purse
without
blemishing
my
honesty
and
after
i
had
been
rooked
of
all
the
rest
amongst
them
i
must
needs
risk
the
last
five
pieces
with
that
shark
among
the
minnows
granted
said
dame
ursula
all
this
i
know
and
i
own
that
as
lord
glenvarloch
was
the
last
you
played
with
you
have
a
right
to
charge
your
ruin
on
his
head
moreover
i
admit
as
already
said
that
margaret
has
made
him
your
rival
yet
surely
now
he
is
in
danger
to
lose
his
hand
it
is
not
a
time
to
remember
all
this
by
my
faith
but
it
is
though
said
the
young
citizen
lose
his
hand
indeed
they
may
take
his
head
for
what
i
care
head
and
hand
have
made
me
a
miserable
wretch
now
were
it
not
better
my
prince
of
said
dame
ursula
that
matters
were
squared
between
you
and
that
through
means
of
the
same
scottish
lord
who
has
as
you
say
deprived
you
of
your
money
and
your
mistress
you
should
in
a
short
time
recover
both
and
how
can
your
wisdom
come
to
that
conclusion
dame
said
the
apprentice
my
money
indeed
i
can
conceive
that
is
if
i
comply
with
your
proposal
but
my
pretty
marget
how
serving
this
lord
whom
she
has
set
her
nonsensical
head
upon
can
do
me
good
with
her
is
far
beyond
my
that
is
because
in
simple
phrase
said
dame
ursula
thou
knowest
no
more
of
a
woman
heart
than
doth
a
norfolk
gosling
look
you
man
were
i
to
report
to
mistress
margaret
that
the
young
lord
has
miscarried
through
thy
lack
of
courtesy
in
refusing
to
help
him
why
then
thou
wert
odious
to
her
for
ever
she
will
loathe
thee
as
she
will
loathe
the
very
cook
who
is
to
strike
off
glenvarloch
hand
with
his
cleaver
and
then
she
will
be
yet
more
fixed
in
her
affections
towards
this
lord
london
will
hear
of
nothing
but
him
speak
of
nothing
but
him
think
of
nothing
but
him
for
three
weeks
at
least
and
all
that
outcry
will
serve
to
keep
him
uppermost
in
her
mind
for
nothing
pleases
a
girl
so
much
as
to
bear
relation
to
any
one
who
is
the
talk
of
the
whole
world
around
her
then
if
he
suffer
this
sentence
of
the
law
it
is
a
chance
if
she
ever
forgets
him
i
saw
that
handsome
proper
young
gentleman
babington
suffer
in
the
queen
time
myself
and
though
i
was
then
but
a
girl
he
was
in
my
head
for
a
year
after
he
was
hanged
but
above
all
pardoned
or
punished
glenvarloch
will
probably
remain
in
london
and
his
presence
will
keep
up
the
silly
girl
nonsensical
fancy
about
him
whereas
if
he
escapes
ay
show
me
how
that
is
to
avail
me
said
jenkin
if
he
escapes
said
the
dame
resuming
her
argument
he
must
resign
the
court
for
years
if
not
for
life
and
you
know
the
old
saying
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
true
most
true
said
jenkin
spoken
like
an
oracle
most
wise
ay
ay
i
knew
you
would
hear
reason
at
last
said
the
wily
dame
and
then
when
this
same
lord
is
off
and
away
for
once
and
for
ever
who
i
pray
you
is
to
be
pretty
pet
confidential
person
and
who
is
to
fill
up
the
void
in
her
affections
why
who
but
thou
thou
pearl
of
and
then
you
will
have
overcome
your
own
inclinations
to
comply
with
hers
and
every
woman
is
sensible
of
that
and
you
will
have
run
some
risk
too
in
carrying
her
desires
into
effect
and
what
is
it
that
woman
likes
better
than
bravery
and
devotion
to
her
will
then
you
have
her
secret
and
she
must
treat
you
with
favour
and
observance
and
repose
confidence
in
you
and
hold
private
intercourse
with
you
till
she
weeps
with
one
eye
for
the
absent
lover
whom
she
is
never
to
see
again
and
blinks
with
the
other
blithely
upon
him
who
is
in
presence
and
then
if
you
know
not
how
to
improve
the
relation
in
which
you
stand
with
her
you
are
not
the
brisk
lively
lad
that
all
the
world
takes
you
for
said
i
well
you
have
spoken
like
an
empress
most
mighty
ursula
said
jenkin
vincent
and
your
will
shall
be
you
know
alsatia
well
continued
his
tutoress
well
enough
well
enough
replied
he
with
a
nod
i
have
heard
the
dice
rattle
there
in
my
day
before
i
must
set
up
for
gentleman
and
go
among
the
gallants
at
the
shavaleer
bojo
as
they
call
him
the
worse
rookery
of
the
two
though
the
feathers
are
the
and
they
will
have
a
respect
for
thee
yonder
i
warrant
ay
ay
replied
vin
when
i
am
got
into
my
fustian
doublet
again
with
my
bit
of
a
trunnion
under
my
arm
i
can
walk
alsatia
at
midnight
as
i
could
do
that
there
fleet
street
in
midday
they
will
not
one
of
them
swagger
with
the
prince
of
and
the
king
of
clubs
they
know
i
could
bring
every
tall
boy
in
the
ward
down
upon
and
you
know
all
the
watermen
and
so
forth
can
converse
with
every
sculler
in
his
own
language
from
richmond
to
gravesend
and
know
all
the
from
john
taylor
the
poet
to
little
grigg
the
grinner
who
never
pulls
but
he
shows
all
his
teeth
from
ear
to
ear
as
if
he
were
grimacing
through
a
and
you
can
take
any
dress
or
character
upon
you
well
such
as
a
waterman
a
butcher
a
continued
ursula
or
the
like
not
such
a
mummer
as
i
am
within
the
walls
and
thou
knowest
that
well
enough
dame
replied
the
apprentice
i
can
touch
the
players
themselves
at
the
ball
and
at
the
fortune
for
presenting
any
thing
except
a
gentleman
take
but
this
d
d
skin
of
frippery
off
me
which
i
think
the
devil
stuck
me
into
and
you
shall
put
me
into
nothing
else
that
i
will
not
become
as
if
i
were
born
to
well
we
will
talk
of
your
transmutation
by
and
by
said
the
dame
and
find
you
clothes
withal
and
money
besides
for
it
will
take
a
good
deal
to
carry
the
thing
handsomely
but
where
is
that
money
to
come
from
dame
said
jenkin
there
is
a
question
i
would
fain
have
answered
before
i
touch
why
what
a
fool
art
thou
to
ask
such
a
question
suppose
i
am
content
to
advance
it
to
please
young
madam
what
is
the
harm
then
i
will
suppose
no
such
thing
said
jenkin
hastily
i
know
that
you
dame
have
no
gold
to
spare
and
maybe
would
not
spare
it
if
you
had
so
that
cock
will
not
crow
it
must
be
from
margaret
well
thou
suspicious
animal
and
what
if
it
were
said
ursula
only
this
replied
jenkin
that
i
will
presently
to
her
and
learn
if
she
has
come
fairly
by
so
much
ready
money
for
sooner
than
connive
at
her
getting
it
by
any
indirection
i
would
hang
myself
at
once
it
is
enough
what
i
have
done
myself
no
need
to
engage
poor
margaret
in
such
villainy
i
to
her
and
tell
her
of
the
danger
i
will
by
heaven
you
are
mad
to
think
of
it
said
dame
suddlechop
considerably
alarmed
hear
me
but
a
moment
i
know
not
precisely
from
whom
she
got
the
money
but
sure
i
am
that
she
obtained
it
at
her
why
master
george
heriot
is
not
returned
from
france
said
jenkin
no
replied
ursula
but
dame
judith
is
at
home
and
the
strange
lady
whom
they
call
master
heriot
ghost
she
never
goes
it
is
very
true
dame
suddlechop
said
jenkin
and
i
believe
you
have
guessed
right
they
say
that
lady
has
coin
at
will
and
if
marget
can
get
a
handful
of
why
she
is
free
to
throw
it
away
at
ah
jin
vin
said
the
dame
reducing
her
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
we
should
not
want
gold
at
will
neither
could
we
but
read
the
riddle
of
that
lady
they
may
read
it
that
list
said
jenkin
i
never
pry
into
what
concerns
me
not
master
george
heriot
is
a
worthy
and
brave
citizen
and
an
honour
to
london
and
has
a
right
to
manage
his
own
household
as
he
likes
there
was
once
a
talk
of
rabbling
him
the
fifth
of
november
before
the
last
because
they
said
he
kept
a
nunnery
in
his
house
like
old
lady
foljambe
but
master
george
is
well
loved
among
the
and
we
got
so
many
brisk
boys
of
us
together
as
should
have
rabbled
the
rabble
had
they
had
but
the
heart
to
well
let
that
pass
said
ursula
and
now
tell
me
how
you
will
manage
to
be
absent
from
shop
a
day
or
two
for
you
must
think
that
this
matter
will
not
be
ended
why
as
to
that
i
can
say
nothing
said
jenkin
i
have
always
served
duly
and
truly
i
have
no
heart
to
play
truant
and
cheat
my
master
of
his
time
as
well
as
his
nay
but
the
point
is
to
get
back
his
money
for
him
said
ursula
which
he
is
not
likely
to
see
on
other
conditions
could
you
not
ask
leave
to
go
down
to
your
uncle
in
essex
for
two
or
three
days
he
may
be
ill
you
why
if
i
must
i
must
said
jenkin
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
i
will
not
be
lightly
caught
treading
these
dark
and
crooked
paths
hush
thee
then
said
the
dame
and
get
leave
for
this
very
evening
and
come
back
hither
and
i
will
introduce
you
to
another
implement
who
must
be
employed
in
the
stay
stay
the
lad
is
mazed
you
would
not
go
into
your
master
shop
in
that
guise
surely
your
trunk
is
in
the
matted
chamber
with
your
things
go
and
put
them
on
as
fast
as
you
i
think
i
am
bewitched
said
jenkin
giving
a
glance
towards
his
dress
or
that
these
fool
trappings
have
made
as
great
an
ass
of
me
as
of
many
i
have
seen
wear
them
but
let
line
once
be
rid
of
the
harness
and
if
you
catch
me
putting
it
on
again
i
will
give
you
leave
to
sell
me
to
a
gipsy
to
carry
pots
pans
and
beggar
bantlings
all
the
rest
of
my
so

retired

change

by
the
engagement
contracted
in
our
sad
and
solitary
in
the
mansion
of
trapbois
the
usurer
having
just
received
a
letter
instead
of
a
visit
from
his
friend
the
templar
stating
reasons
why
he
could
not
at
that
time
come
to
see
him
in
alsatia
so
that
it
appeared
that
his
intercourse
with
the
better
and
more
respectable
class
of
society
was
for
the
present
entirely
cut
off
this
was
a
melancholy
and
to
a
proud
mind
like
that
of
nigel
a
degrading
reflection
he
went
to
the
window
of
his
apartment
and
found
the
street
enveloped
in
one
of
those
thick
dingy
fogs
which
often
invest
the
lower
part
of
london
and
westminster
amid
the
darkness
dense
and
palpable
were
seen
to
wander
like
phantoms
a
reveller
or
two
whom
the
morning
had
surprised
where
the
evening
left
them
and
who
now
with
tottering
steps
and
by
an
instinct
which
intoxication
could
not
wholly
overcome
were
groping
the
way
to
their
own
homes
to
convert
day
into
night
for
the
purpose
of
sleeping
off
the
debauch
which
had
turned
night
into
day
although
it
was
broad
day
in
the
other
parts
of
the
city
it
was
scarce
dawn
yet
in
alsatia
and
none
of
the
sounds
of
industry
or
occupation
were
there
heard
which
had
long
before
aroused
the
slumberers
in
any
other
quarter
the
prospect
was
too
tiresome
and
disagreeable
to
detain
lord
glenvarloch
at
his
station
so
turning
from
the
window
he
examined
with
more
interest
the
furniture
and
appearance
of
the
apartment
which
he
tenanted
much
of
it
had
been
in
its
time
rich
and
curious
there
was
a
huge
bed
with
as
much
carved
oak
about
it
as
would
have
made
the
head
of
a
and
tapestry
hangings
ample
enough
to
have
been
her
sails
there
was
a
huge
mirror
with
a
massy
frame
of
gilt
which
was
of
venetian
manufacture
and
must
have
been
worth
a
considerable
sum
before
it
received
the
tremendous
crack
which
traversing
it
from
one
corner
to
the
other
bore
the
same
proportion
to
the
surface
that
the
nile
bears
to
the
map
of
egypt
the
chairs
were
of
different
forms
and
shapes
some
had
been
carved
some
gilded
some
covered
with
damasked
leather
some
with
embroidered
work
but
all
were
damaged
and
there
was
a
picture
of
susanna
and
the
elders
over
the
which
might
have
been
accounted
a
choice
piece
had
not
the
rats
made
free
with
the
chaste
fair
one
nose
and
with
the
beard
of
one
of
her
reverend
admirers
in
a
word
all
that
lord
glenvarloch
saw
seemed
to
have
been
articles
carried
off
by
appraisement
or
distress
or
bought
as
pennyworths
at
some
obscure
broker
and
huddled
together
in
the
apartment
as
in
a
without
regard
to
taste
or
congruity
the
place
appeared
to
nigel
to
resemble
the
houses
near
the
which
are
too
often
furnished
with
the
spoils
of
wrecked
vessels
as
this
was
probably
fitted
up
with
the
relics
of
ruined
my
own
skiff
is
among
the
breakers
thought
lord
glenvarloch
though
my
wreck
will
add
little
to
the
profits
of
the
he
was
chiefly
interested
in
the
state
of
the
grate
a
huge
assemblage
of
rusted
iron
bars
which
stood
in
the
chimney
unequally
supported
by
three
brazen
feet
moulded
into
the
form
of
lion
claws
while
the
fourth
which
had
been
bent
by
an
accident
seemed
proudly
uplifted
as
if
to
paw
the
ground
or
as
if
the
whole
article
had
nourished
the
ambitious
purpose
of
pacing
forth
into
the
middle
of
the
apartment
and
had
one
foot
ready
raised
for
the
journey
a
smile
passed
over
face
as
this
fantastic
idea
presented
itself
to
his
i
must
stop
its
march
however
he
thought
for
this
morning
is
chill
and
raw
enough
to
demand
some
he
called
accordingly
from
the
top
of
a
large
staircase
with
a
heavy
oaken
balustrade
which
gave
access
to
his
own
and
other
apartments
for
the
house
was
old
and
of
considerable
size
but
receiving
no
answer
to
his
repeated
summons
he
was
compelled
to
go
in
search
of
some
one
who
might
accommodate
him
with
what
he
wanted
nigel
had
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
old
world
in
scotland
received
an
education
which
might
in
most
particulars
be
termed
simple
hardy
and
unostentatious
but
he
had
nevertheless
been
accustomed
to
much
personal
deference
and
to
the
constant
attendance
and
ministry
of
one
or
more
domestics
this
was
the
universal
custom
in
scotland
where
wages
were
next
to
nothing
and
where
indeed
a
man
of
title
or
influence
might
have
as
many
attendants
as
he
pleased
for
the
mere
expense
of
food
clothes
and
countenance
nigel
was
therefore
mortified
and
displeased
when
he
found
himself
without
notice
or
attendance
and
the
more
dissatisfied
because
he
was
at
the
same
time
angry
with
himself
for
suffering
such
a
trifle
to
trouble
him
at
all
amongst
matters
of
more
deep
concernment
there
must
surely
be
some
servants
in
so
large
a
house
as
this
said
he
as
he
wandered
over
the
place
through
which
he
was
conducted
by
a
passage
which
branched
off
from
the
gallery
as
he
went
on
he
tried
the
entrance
to
several
apartments
some
of
which
he
found
were
locked
and
others
unfurnished
all
apparently
unoccupied
so
that
at
length
he
returned
to
the
staircase
and
resolved
to
make
his
way
down
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
where
he
supposed
he
must
at
least
find
the
old
gentleman
and
his
daughter
with
this
purpose
he
first
made
his
entrance
into
a
little
low
dark
parlour
containing
a
leathern
before
which
stood
a
pair
of
slippers
while
on
the
left
side
rested
a
staff
an
oaken
table
stood
before
it
and
supported
a
huge
desk
clamped
with
iron
and
a
massive
pewter
inkstand
around
the
apartment
were
shelves
cabinets
and
other
places
convenient
for
depositing
papers
a
sword
musketoon
and
a
pair
of
pistols
hung
over
the
chimney
in
ostentatious
display
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
proprietor
would
be
prompt
in
the
defence
of
his
premises
this
must
be
the
usurer
den
thought
nigel
and
he
was
about
to
call
aloud
when
the
old
man
awakened
even
by
the
slightest
noise
for
avarice
seldom
sleeps
sound
soon
was
heard
from
the
inner
room
speaking
in
a
voice
of
irritability
rendered
more
tremulous
by
his
morning
cough
ugh
ugh
ugh
who
is
there
i
say
ugh
ugh
who
is
there
why
martha
ugh
ugh
martha
trapbois
here
be
thieves
in
the
house
and
they
will
not
speak
to
me
why
martha
thieves
thieves
ugh
ugh
ugh
nigel
endeavoured
to
explain
but
the
idea
of
thieves
had
taken
possession
of
the
old
man
pineal
gland
and
he
kept
coughing
and
screaming
and
screaming
and
coughing
until
the
gracious
martha
entered
the
apartment
and
having
first
outscreamed
her
father
in
order
to
convince
him
that
there
was
no
danger
and
to
assure
him
that
the
intruder
was
their
new
lodger
and
having
as
often
heard
her
sire
ejaculate
hold
him
fast
ugh
ugh
hold
him
fast
till
i
come
she
at
length
succeeded
in
silencing
his
fears
and
his
clamour
and
then
coldly
and
dryly
asked
lord
glenvarloch
what
he
wanted
in
her
apartment
her
lodger
had
in
the
meantime
leisure
to
contemplate
her
appearance
which
did
not
by
any
means
improve
the
idea
he
had
formed
of
it
by
candlelight
on
the
preceding
evening
she
was
dressed
in
what
was
called
a
queen
mary
ruff
and
farthingale
not
the
falling
ruff
with
which
the
unfortunate
mary
of
scotland
is
usually
painted
but
that
which
with
more
than
spanish
stiffness
surrounded
the
throat
and
set
off
the
morose
head
of
her
fierce
namesake
of
smithfield
memory
this
antiquated
dress
assorted
well
with
the
faded
complexion
grey
eyes
thin
lips
and
austere
visage
of
the
antiquated
maiden
which
was
moreover
enhanced
by
a
black
hood
worn
as
her
carefully
disposed
so
as
to
prevent
any
of
her
hair
from
escaping
to
view
probably
because
the
simplicity
of
the
period
knew
no
art
of
disguising
the
colour
with
which
time
had
begun
to
grizzle
her
tresses
her
figure
was
tall
thin
and
flat
with
skinny
arms
and
hands
and
feet
of
the
larger
size
cased
in
huge
shoes
which
added
height
to
a
stature
already
ungainly
apparently
some
art
had
been
used
by
the
tailor
to
conceal
a
slight
defect
of
shape
occasioned
by
the
accidental
elevation
of
one
shoulder
above
the
other
but
the
praiseworthy
efforts
of
the
ingenious
mechanic
had
only
succeeded
in
calling
the
attention
of
the
observer
to
his
benevolent
purpose
without
demonstrating
that
he
had
been
able
to
achieve
it
such
was
martha
trapbois
whose
dry
what
were
you
seeking
here
sir
fell
again
and
with
reiterated
sharpness
on
the
ear
of
nigel
as
he
gazed
upon
her
presence
and
compared
it
internally
to
one
of
the
faded
and
grim
figures
in
the
old
tapestry
which
adorned
his
bedstead
it
was
however
necessary
to
reply
and
he
answered
that
he
came
in
search
of
the
servants
as
he
desired
to
have
a
fire
kindled
in
his
apartment
on
account
of
the
rawness
of
the
morning
the
woman
who
does
our
answered
mistress
martha
comes
at
eight
you
want
fire
sooner
there
are
fagots
and
a
bucket
of
in
the
at
the
head
of
the
stair
and
there
is
a
flint
and
steel
on
the
upper
shelf
you
can
light
fire
for
yourself
if
you
no
no
no
martha
ejaculated
her
father
who
having
donned
his
rustic
tunic
with
his
hose
all
ungirt
and
his
feet
hastily
came
out
of
the
inner
apartment
with
his
mind
probably
full
of
robbers
for
he
had
a
naked
rapier
in
his
hand
which
still
looked
formidable
though
rust
had
somewhat
marred
its
what
he
had
heard
at
entrance
about
lighting
a
fire
had
changed
however
the
current
of
his
ideas
no
no
no
he
cried
and
each
negative
was
more
emphatic
than
its
the
gentleman
shall
not
have
the
trouble
to
put
on
a
fire
ugh
ugh
i
put
it
on
myself
for
a
this
last
word
was
a
favourite
expression
with
the
old
gentleman
which
he
pronounced
in
a
peculiar
manner
gasping
it
out
syllable
by
syllable
and
laying
a
strong
emphasis
upon
the
last
it
was
indeed
a
sort
of
protecting
clause
by
which
he
guarded
himself
against
all
inconveniences
attendant
on
the
rash
habit
of
offering
service
or
civility
of
any
kind
the
which
when
hastily
snapped
at
by
those
to
whom
they
are
uttered
give
the
profferer
sometimes
room
to
repent
his
promptitude
for
shame
father
said
martha
that
must
not
be
master
grahame
will
kindle
his
own
fire
or
wait
till
the
comes
to
do
it
for
him
just
as
likes
him
no
child
no
child
child
martha
no
reiterated
the
old
miser
no
shall
ever
touch
a
grate
in
my
house
they
put
ugh
ugh
the
faggot
uppermost
and
so
the
coal
kindles
not
and
the
flame
goes
up
the
chimney
and
wood
and
heat
are
both
thrown
away
now
i
will
lay
it
properly
for
the
gentleman
for
a
consideration
so
that
it
shall
last
ugh
ugh
last
the
whole
here
his
vehemence
increased
his
cough
so
violently
that
nigel
could
only
from
a
scattered
word
here
and
there
comprehend
that
it
was
a
recommendation
to
his
daughter
to
remove
the
poker
and
tongs
from
the
stranger
fireside
with
an
assurance
that
when
necessary
his
landlord
would
be
in
attendance
to
adjust
it
himself
for
a
martha
paid
as
little
attention
to
the
old
man
injunctions
as
a
predominant
dame
gives
to
those
of
a
henpecked
husband
she
only
repeated
in
a
deeper
and
more
emphatic
tone
of
censure
for
shame
father
for
shame
then
turning
to
her
guest
said
with
her
usual
ungraciousness
of
manner
master
grahame
it
is
best
to
be
plain
with
you
at
first
my
father
is
an
old
a
very
old
man
and
his
wits
as
you
may
see
are
somewhat
weakened
though
i
would
not
advise
you
to
make
a
bargain
with
him
else
you
may
find
them
too
sharp
for
your
own
for
myself
i
am
a
lone
woman
and
to
say
truth
care
little
to
see
or
converse
with
any
one
if
you
can
be
satisfied
with
shelter
and
safety
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
have
them
not
and
they
are
not
always
to
be
found
in
this
unhappy
quarter
but
if
you
seek
deferential
observance
and
attendance
i
tell
you
at
once
you
will
not
find
them
i
am
not
wont
either
to
thrust
myself
upon
acquaintance
madam
or
to
give
trouble
said
the
guest
nevertheless
i
shall
need
the
assistance
of
a
domestic
to
assist
me
to
dress
perhaps
you
can
recommend
me
to
such
yes
to
twenty
answered
mistress
martha
who
will
pick
your
purse
while
they
tie
your
points
and
cut
your
throat
while
they
smooth
your
i
will
be
his
servant
myself
said
the
old
man
whose
intellect
for
a
moment
distanced
had
again
in
some
measure
got
up
with
the
conversation
i
will
brush
his
cloak
ugh
ugh
and
tie
his
points
ugh
ugh
and
clean
his
shoes
ugh
and
run
on
his
errands
with
speed
and
safety
ugh
ugh
ugh
ugh
for
a
to
you
sir
said
martha
to
nigel
in
a
tone
of
direct
and
positive
dismissal
it
can
not
be
agreeable
to
a
daughter
that
a
stranger
should
hear
her
father
speak
thus
if
you
be
really
a
gentleman
you
will
retire
to
your
own
i
will
not
delay
a
moment
said
nigel
respectfully
for
he
was
sensible
that
circumstances
palliated
the
woman
rudeness
i
would
but
ask
you
if
seriously
there
can
be
danger
in
procuring
the
assistance
of
a
in
this
place
young
gentleman
said
martha
you
must
know
little
of
whitefriars
to
ask
the
question
we
live
alone
in
this
house
and
seldom
has
a
stranger
entered
it
nor
should
you
to
be
plain
had
my
will
been
consulted
look
at
the
door
see
if
that
of
a
castle
can
be
better
secured
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
are
grated
on
the
outside
and
within
look
to
these
she
pulled
one
of
them
aside
and
showed
a
ponderous
apparatus
of
bolts
and
chains
for
securing
the
while
her
father
pressing
to
her
side
seized
her
gown
with
a
trembling
hand
and
said
in
a
low
whisper
show
not
the
trick
of
locking
and
undoing
them
show
him
not
the
trick
o
martha
ugh
ugh
on
martha
went
on
without
paying
him
any
attention
and
yet
young
gentleman
we
have
been
more
than
once
like
to
find
all
these
defences
too
weak
to
protect
our
lives
such
an
evil
effect
on
the
wicked
generation
around
us
hath
been
made
by
the
unhappy
report
of
my
poor
father
say
nothing
of
that
housewife
said
the
miser
his
irritability
increased
by
the
very
supposition
of
his
being
wealthy
say
nothing
of
that
or
i
will
beat
thee
housewife
beat
thee
with
my
staff
for
fetching
and
carrying
lies
that
will
procure
our
throats
to
be
cut
at
last
ugh
i
am
but
a
poor
man
he
continued
turning
to
nigel
a
very
poor
man
that
am
willing
to
do
any
honest
turn
upon
earth
for
a
modest
i
therefore
warn
you
of
the
life
you
must
lead
young
gentleman
said
martha
the
poor
woman
who
does
the
will
assist
you
so
far
as
in
her
power
but
the
wise
man
is
his
own
best
servant
and
it
is
a
lesson
you
have
taught
me
madam
and
i
thank
you
for
it
i
will
assuredly
study
it
at
you
will
do
well
said
martha
and
as
you
seem
thankful
for
advice
i
though
i
am
no
professed
counsellor
of
others
will
give
you
more
make
no
intimacy
with
any
one
in
whitefriars
borrow
no
money
on
any
score
especially
from
my
father
for
dotard
as
he
seems
he
will
make
an
ass
of
you
last
and
best
of
all
stay
here
not
an
instant
longer
than
you
can
help
it
farewell
a
gnarled
tree
may
bear
good
fruit
and
a
harsh
nature
may
give
good
counsel
thought
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
as
he
retreated
to
his
own
apartment
where
the
same
reflection
occurred
to
him
again
and
again
while
unable
as
yet
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
thoughts
of
becoming
his
own
he
walked
up
and
down
his
bedroom
to
warm
himself
by
exercise
at
length
his
meditations
arranged
themselves
in
the
following
soliloquy
by
which
expression
i
beg
leave
to
observe
once
for
all
that
i
do
not
mean
that
nigel
literally
said
aloud
with
his
bodily
organs
the
words
which
follow
in
inverted
commas
while
pacing
the
room
by
himself
but
that
i
myself
choose
to
present
to
my
dearest
reader
the
picture
of
my
hero
mind
his
reflections
and
resolutions
in
the
form
of
a
speech
rather
than
in
that
of
a
narrative
in
other
words
i
have
put
his
thoughts
into
language
and
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
soliloquy
upon
the
stage
as
well
as
in
the
closet
being
at
once
the
most
natural
and
perhaps
the
only
way
of
communicating
to
the
spectator
what
is
supposed
to
be
passing
in
the
bosom
of
the
scenic
personage
there
are
no
such
soliloquies
in
nature
it
is
true
but
unless
they
were
received
as
a
conventional
medium
of
communication
betwixt
the
poet
and
the
audience
we
should
reduce
dramatic
authors
to
the
recipe
of
master
puff
who
makes
lord
burleigh
intimate
a
long
train
of
political
reasoning
to
the
audience
by
one
comprehensive
shake
of
his
noddle
in
narrative
no
doubt
the
writer
has
the
alternative
of
telling
that
his
personages
thought
so
and
so
inferred
thus
and
thus
and
arrived
at
such
and
such
a
conclusion
but
the
soliloquy
is
a
more
concise
and
spirited
mode
of
communicating
the
same
information
and
therefore
thus
communed
or
thus
might
have
communed
the
lord
of
glenvarloch
with
his
own
mind
she
is
right
and
has
taught
me
a
lesson
i
will
profit
by
i
have
been
through
my
whole
life
one
who
leant
upon
others
for
that
assistance
which
it
is
more
truly
noble
to
derive
from
my
own
exertions
i
am
ashamed
of
feeling
the
paltry
inconvenience
which
long
habit
had
led
me
to
annex
to
the
want
of
a
servant
assistance
i
am
ashamed
of
that
but
far
far
more
am
i
ashamed
to
have
suffered
the
same
habit
of
throwing
my
own
burden
on
others
to
render
me
since
i
came
to
this
city
a
mere
victim
of
those
events
which
i
have
never
even
attempted
to
influence
a
thing
never
acting
but
perpetually
acted
upon
protected
by
one
friend
deceived
by
another
but
in
the
advantage
which
i
received
from
the
one
and
the
evil
i
have
sustained
from
the
other
as
passive
and
helpless
as
a
boat
that
drifts
without
oar
or
rudder
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
i
became
a
courtier
because
heriot
so
advised
it
a
gamester
because
dalgarno
so
contrived
it
an
alsatian
because
lowestoffe
so
willed
it
whatever
of
good
or
bad
has
befallen
me
has
arisen
out
of
the
agency
of
others
not
from
my
own
my
father
son
must
no
longer
hold
this
facile
and
puerile
course
live
or
die
sink
or
swim
nigel
olifaunt
from
this
moment
shall
owe
his
safety
success
and
honour
to
his
own
exertions
or
shall
fall
with
the
credit
of
having
at
least
exerted
his
own
free
agency
i
will
write
it
down
in
my
tablets
in
her
very
words
wise
man
is
his
own
best
assistant
he
had
just
put
his
tablets
in
his
pocket
when
the
old
charwoman
who
to
add
to
her
efficiency
was
sadly
crippled
by
rheumatism
hobbled
into
the
room
to
try
if
she
could
gain
a
small
gratification
by
waiting
on
the
stranger
she
readily
undertook
to
get
lord
glenvarloch
breakfast
and
as
there
was
an
at
the
next
door
she
succeeded
in
a
shorter
time
than
nigel
had
augured
as
his
solitary
meal
was
finished
one
of
the
temple
porters
or
inferior
officers
was
announced
as
seeking
master
grahame
on
the
part
of
his
friend
master
lowestoffe
and
being
admitted
by
the
old
woman
to
his
apartment
he
delivered
to
nigel
a
small
with
the
clothes
he
had
desired
should
be
sent
to
him
and
then
with
more
mystery
put
into
his
hand
a
casket
or
which
he
carefully
concealed
beneath
his
cloak
i
am
glad
to
be
rid
o
said
the
fellow
as
he
placed
it
on
the
table
why
it
is
surely
not
so
very
heavy
answered
nigel
and
you
are
a
stout
young
ay
sir
replied
the
fellow
but
samson
himself
would
not
have
carried
such
a
matter
safely
through
alsatia
had
the
lads
of
the
huff
known
what
it
was
please
to
look
into
it
sir
and
see
all
is
right
i
am
an
honest
fellow
and
it
comes
safe
out
of
my
hands
how
long
it
may
remain
so
afterwards
will
depend
on
your
own
care
i
would
not
my
good
name
were
to
suffer
by
any
to
satisfy
the
scruples
of
the
messenger
lord
glenvarloch
opened
the
casket
in
his
presence
and
saw
that
his
small
stock
of
money
with
two
or
three
valuable
papers
which
it
contained
and
particularly
the
original
which
the
king
had
granted
in
his
favour
were
in
the
same
order
in
which
he
had
left
them
at
the
man
further
instance
he
availed
himself
of
the
writing
materials
which
were
in
the
casket
in
order
to
send
a
line
to
master
lowestoffe
declaring
that
his
property
had
reached
him
in
safety
he
added
some
grateful
acknowledgments
for
lowestoffe
services
and
just
as
he
was
sealing
and
delivering
his
billet
to
the
messenger
his
aged
landlord
entered
the
apartment
his
threadbare
suit
of
black
clothes
was
now
somewhat
better
arranged
than
they
had
been
in
the
dishabille
of
his
first
appearance
and
his
nerves
and
intellects
seemed
to
be
less
fluttered
for
without
much
coughing
or
hesitation
he
invited
nigel
to
partake
of
a
morning
draught
of
wholesome
single
ale
which
he
brought
in
a
large
leathern
tankard
or
carried
in
the
one
hand
while
the
other
stirred
it
round
with
a
sprig
of
rosemary
to
give
it
as
the
old
man
said
a
flavour
nigel
declined
the
courteous
proffer
and
intimated
by
his
manner
while
he
did
so
that
he
desired
no
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
his
own
apartment
which
indeed
he
was
the
more
entitled
to
maintain
considering
the
cold
reception
he
had
that
morning
met
with
when
straying
from
its
precincts
into
those
of
his
landlord
but
the
open
casket
contained
matter
or
rather
metal
so
attractive
to
old
trapbois
that
he
remained
fixed
like
a
at
a
dead
point
his
nose
advanced
and
one
hand
expanded
like
the
lifted
forepaw
by
which
that
sagacious
quadruped
sometimes
indicates
that
it
is
a
hare
which
he
has
in
the
wind
nigel
was
about
to
break
the
charm
which
had
thus
arrested
old
trapbois
by
shutting
the
lid
of
the
casket
when
his
attention
was
withdrawn
from
him
by
the
question
of
the
messenger
who
holding
out
the
letter
asked
whether
he
was
to
leave
it
at
chambers
in
the
temple
or
carry
it
to
the
marshalsea
the
marshalsea
repeated
lord
glenvarloch
what
of
the
marshalsea
why
sir
said
the
man
the
poor
gentleman
is
laid
up
there
in
lavender
because
they
say
his
own
kind
heart
led
him
to
scald
his
fingers
with
another
man
nigel
hastily
snatched
back
the
letter
broke
the
seal
joined
to
the
contents
his
earnest
entreaty
that
he
might
be
instantly
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
confinement
and
added
that
if
it
arose
out
of
his
own
unhappy
affair
it
would
be
of
a
brief
duration
since
he
had
even
before
hearing
of
a
reason
which
so
peremptorily
demanded
that
he
should
surrender
himself
adopted
the
resolution
to
do
so
as
the
manliest
and
most
proper
course
which
his
ill
fortune
and
imprudence
had
left
in
his
own
power
he
therefore
conjured
lowestoffe
to
have
no
delicacy
upon
this
score
but
since
his
surrender
was
what
he
had
determined
upon
as
a
sacrifice
due
to
his
own
character
that
he
would
have
the
frankness
to
mention
in
what
manner
it
could
be
best
arranged
so
as
to
extricate
him
lowestoffe
from
the
restraint
to
which
the
writer
could
not
but
fear
his
friend
had
been
subjected
on
account
of
the
generous
interest
which
he
had
taken
in
his
concerns
the
letter
concluded
that
the
writer
would
suffer
hours
to
elapse
in
expectation
of
hearing
from
him
and
at
the
end
of
that
period
was
determined
to
put
his
purpose
in
execution
he
delivered
the
billet
to
the
messenger
and
enforcing
his
request
with
a
piece
of
money
urged
him
without
a
moment
delay
to
convey
it
to
the
hands
of
master
lowestoffe
i
i
i
will
carry
it
to
him
myself
said
the
old
usurer
for
half
the
the
man
who
heard
this
attempt
to
take
his
duty
and
perquisites
over
his
head
lost
no
time
in
pocketing
the
money
and
departed
on
his
errand
as
fast
as
he
could
master
trapbois
said
nigel
addressing
the
old
man
somewhat
impatiently
had
you
any
particular
commands
for
me
i
i
came
to
see
if
you
rested
well
answered
the
old
man
and
if
i
could
do
anything
to
serve
you
on
any
sir
i
thank
you
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
thank
you
and
ere
he
could
say
more
a
heavy
footstep
was
heard
on
the
stair
my
god
exclaimed
the
old
man
starting
up
why
dorothy
why
daughter
draw
bolt
i
say
housewives
the
door
hath
been
left
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
wide
and
in
strutted
the
portly
bulk
of
the
military
hero
whom
nigel
had
on
the
preceding
evening
in
vain
endeavoured
to
recognise
chapter
xxiii
bilboe
the
word
pierrot
it
hath
been
spoke
too
often
the
spell
hath
lost
its
charm
i
tell
thee
friend
the
meanest
cur
that
trots
the
street
will
turn
and
snarl
against
your
proffer
bastinado
is
art
shall
do
it
then
i
will
dose
the
mongrels
or
in
plain
terms
i
use
the
private
knife
of
the
falchion
the
noble
captain
colepepper
or
peppercull
for
he
was
known
by
both
these
names
and
some
others
besides
had
a
martial
and
a
swashing
exterior
which
on
the
present
occasion
was
rendered
yet
more
peculiar
by
a
patch
covering
his
left
eye
and
a
part
of
the
cheek
the
sleeves
of
his
thickset
velvet
jerkin
were
polished
and
shone
with
grease
his
buff
gloves
had
huge
tops
which
reached
almost
to
the
elbow
his
of
the
same
materials
extended
its
breadth
from
his
haunchbone
to
his
small
ribs
and
supported
on
the
one
side
his
large
on
the
other
a
dagger
of
like
proportions
he
paid
his
compliments
to
nigel
with
that
air
of
predetermined
effrontery
which
announces
that
it
will
not
be
repelled
by
any
coldness
of
reception
asked
trapbois
how
he
did
by
the
familiar
title
of
old
peter
pillory
and
then
seizing
upon
the
emptied
it
off
at
a
draught
to
the
health
of
the
last
and
youngest
freeman
of
alsatia
the
noble
and
loving
master
nigel
grahame
when
he
had
set
down
the
empty
pitcher
and
drawn
his
breath
he
began
to
criticise
the
liquor
which
it
had
lately
sufficient
single
beer
old
pillory
and
as
i
take
it
brewed
at
the
rate
of
a
nutshell
of
malt
to
a
butt
of
thames
as
dead
as
a
corpse
too
and
yet
it
went
hissing
down
my
throat
bubbling
by
jove
like
water
upon
hot
you
left
us
early
noble
master
grahame
but
good
faith
we
had
a
carouse
to
your
honour
we
heard
ring
hollow
ere
we
parted
we
were
as
loving
as
we
fought
too
to
finish
off
the
gawdy
i
bear
some
marks
of
the
parson
about
me
you
see
a
note
of
the
sermon
or
so
which
should
have
been
addressed
to
my
ear
but
missed
its
mark
and
reached
my
left
eye
the
man
of
god
bears
my
too
but
the
duke
made
us
friends
again
and
it
cost
me
more
sack
than
i
could
carry
and
all
the
rhenish
to
boot
to
pledge
the
seer
in
the
way
of
love
and
reconciliation
but
caracco
is
a
vile
old
canting
slave
for
all
that
whom
i
will
one
day
beat
out
of
his
devil
livery
into
all
the
colours
of
the
basta
said
i
well
old
trapbois
where
is
thy
daughter
man
what
says
she
to
my
suit
is
an
honest
one
wilt
have
a
soldier
for
thy
old
pillory
to
mingle
the
soul
of
martial
honour
with
thy
thieving
miching
blood
as
men
put
bold
brandy
into
muddy
ale
my
daughter
receives
not
company
so
early
noble
captain
said
the
usurer
and
concluded
his
speech
with
a
dry
emphatical
ugh
what
upon
no
said
the
captain
and
wherefore
not
old
truepenny
she
has
not
much
time
to
lose
in
driving
her
bargain
captain
said
trapbois
i
was
upon
some
little
business
with
our
noble
friend
here
master
nigel
green
ugh
ugh
ugh
and
you
would
have
me
gone
i
warrant
you
answered
the
bully
but
patience
old
pillory
thine
hour
is
not
yet
come
man
you
see
he
said
pointing
to
the
casket
that
noble
master
grahame
whom
you
call
green
has
got
the
and
the
which
you
would
willingly
rid
him
of
ha
ha
ugh
ugh
answered
the
usurer
if
you
knew
how
but
thou
art
one
of
those
that
come
out
for
wool
and
art
sure
to
go
home
shorn
why
now
but
that
i
am
sworn
against
laying
of
wagers
i
would
risk
some
consideration
that
this
honest
guest
of
mine
sends
thee
home
penniless
if
thou
darest
venture
with
him
ugh
ugh
at
any
game
which
gentlemen
play
marry
thou
hast
me
on
the
hip
there
thou
old
miserly
answered
the
captain
taking
a
bale
of
dice
from
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
i
must
always
keep
company
with
these
damnable
doctors
and
they
have
made
me
every
baby
cully
and
purged
my
purse
into
an
atrophy
but
never
mind
it
passes
the
time
as
well
as
aught
else
how
say
you
master
grahame
the
fellow
paused
but
even
the
extremity
of
his
impudence
could
scarcely
hardly
withstand
the
cold
look
of
utter
contempt
with
which
nigel
received
his
proposal
returning
it
with
a
simple
i
only
play
where
i
know
my
company
and
never
in
the
cards
may
be
more
agreeable
said
captain
colepepper
and
for
knowing
your
company
here
is
honest
old
pillory
will
tell
you
jack
colepepper
plays
as
truly
on
the
square
as
a
man
that
trowled
a
die
men
talk
of
high
and
low
dice
fulhams
and
bristles
topping
knapping
slurring
stabbing
and
a
hundred
ways
of
rooking
besides
but
broil
me
like
a
rasher
of
bacon
if
i
could
ever
learn
the
trick
on
you
have
got
the
vocabulary
perfect
sir
at
the
least
said
nigel
in
the
same
cold
tone
yes
by
mine
honour
have
i
returned
the
hector
they
are
phrases
that
a
gentleman
learns
about
but
perhaps
you
would
like
a
set
at
tennis
or
a
game
at
balloon
we
have
an
indifferent
good
court
hard
by
here
and
a
set
of
as
blades
as
ever
banged
leather
against
brick
and
i
beg
to
be
excused
at
present
said
lord
glenvarloch
and
to
be
plain
among
the
valuable
privileges
your
society
has
conferred
on
me
i
hope
i
may
reckon
that
of
being
private
in
my
own
apartment
when
i
have
a
your
humble
servant
sir
said
the
captain
and
i
thank
you
for
your
civility
jack
colepepper
can
have
enough
of
company
and
thrusts
himself
on
no
but
perhaps
you
will
like
to
make
a
match
at
skittles
i
am
by
no
means
that
way
disposed
replied
the
young
nobleman
or
to
leap
a
flea
run
a
snail
match
a
wherry
eh
no
i
will
do
none
of
these
answered
nigel
here
the
old
man
who
had
been
watching
with
his
little
peery
eyes
pulled
the
bulky
hector
by
the
skirt
and
whispered
do
not
vapour
him
the
huff
it
will
not
pass
let
the
trout
play
he
will
rise
to
the
hook
but
the
bully
confiding
in
his
own
strength
and
probably
mistaking
for
timidity
the
patient
scorn
with
which
nigel
received
his
proposals
incited
also
by
the
open
casket
began
to
assume
a
louder
and
more
threatening
tone
he
drew
himself
up
bent
his
brows
assumed
a
look
of
professional
ferocity
and
continued
in
alsatia
look
ye
a
man
must
be
neighbourly
and
companionable
zouns
sir
we
would
slit
any
nose
that
was
turned
up
at
us
honest
ay
sir
we
would
slit
it
up
to
the
gristle
though
it
had
smelt
nothing
all
its
life
but
musk
ambergris
and
rabbit
me
i
am
a
soldier
and
care
no
more
for
a
lord
than
a
lamplighter
are
you
seeking
a
quarrel
sir
said
nigel
calmly
having
in
truth
no
desire
to
engage
himself
in
a
discreditable
broil
in
such
a
place
and
with
such
a
character
quarrel
sir
said
the
captain
i
am
not
seeking
a
quarrel
though
i
care
not
how
soon
i
find
one
only
i
wish
you
to
understand
you
must
be
neighbourly
that
all
what
if
we
should
go
over
the
water
to
the
garden
and
see
a
bull
hanked
this
fine
morning
will
you
do
nothing
something
i
am
strangely
tempted
to
do
at
this
moment
said
nigel
videlicet
said
colepepper
with
a
swaggering
air
let
us
hear
the
i
am
tempted
to
throw
you
headlong
from
the
window
unless
you
presently
make
the
best
of
your
way
down
throw
me
from
the
window
hell
and
furies
exclaimed
the
captain
i
have
confronted
twenty
crooked
sabres
at
buda
with
my
single
rapier
and
shall
a
beggarly
scots
lordling
speak
of
me
and
a
window
in
the
same
breath
stand
off
old
pillory
let
me
make
scotch
collops
of
him
he
dies
the
death
for
the
love
of
heaven
gentlemen
exclaimed
the
old
miser
throwing
himself
between
them
do
not
break
the
peace
on
any
consideration
noble
guest
forbear
the
captain
he
is
a
very
hector
of
troy
trusty
hector
forbear
my
guest
he
is
like
to
prove
a
very
here
he
was
interrupted
by
his
asthma
but
nevertheless
continued
to
interpose
his
person
between
colepepper
who
had
unsheathed
his
whinyard
and
was
making
vain
passes
at
his
antagonist
and
nigel
who
had
stepped
back
to
take
his
sword
and
now
held
it
undrawn
in
his
left
hand
make
an
end
of
this
foolery
you
scoundrel
said
nigel
do
you
come
hither
to
vent
your
noisy
oaths
and
your
valour
on
me
you
seem
to
know
me
and
i
am
half
ashamed
to
say
i
have
at
length
been
able
to
recollect
you
remember
the
garden
behind
the
ordinary
you
dastardly
ruffian
and
the
speed
with
which
fifty
men
saw
you
run
from
a
drawn
get
you
gone
sir
and
do
not
put
me
to
the
vile
labour
of
cudgelling
such
a
cowardly
rascal
down
the
bully
countenance
grew
dark
as
night
at
this
unexpected
recognition
for
he
had
undoubtedly
thought
himself
secure
in
his
change
of
dress
and
his
black
patch
from
being
discovered
by
a
person
who
had
seen
him
but
once
he
set
his
teeth
clenched
his
hands
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
seeking
for
a
moment
courage
to
fly
upon
his
antagonist
but
his
heart
failed
he
sheathed
his
sword
turned
his
back
in
gloomy
silence
and
spoke
not
until
he
reached
the
door
when
turning
round
he
said
with
a
deep
oath
if
i
be
not
avenged
of
you
for
this
insolence
ere
many
days
go
by
i
would
the
gallows
had
my
body
and
the
devil
my
spirit
so
saying
and
with
a
look
where
determined
spite
and
malice
made
his
features
savagely
fierce
though
they
could
not
overcome
his
fear
he
turned
and
left
the
house
nigel
followed
him
as
far
as
the
gallery
at
the
head
of
the
staircase
with
the
purpose
of
seeing
him
depart
and
ere
he
returned
was
met
by
mistress
martha
trapbois
whom
the
noise
of
the
quarrel
had
summoned
from
her
own
apartment
he
could
not
resist
saying
to
her
in
his
natural
displeasure
i
would
madam
you
could
teach
your
father
and
his
friends
the
lesson
which
you
had
the
goodness
to
bestow
on
me
this
morning
and
prevail
on
them
to
leave
me
the
unmolested
privacy
of
my
own
if
you
came
hither
for
quiet
or
retirement
young
man
answered
she
you
have
been
advised
to
an
evil
retreat
you
might
seek
mercy
in
the
or
holiness
in
hell
with
better
success
than
quiet
in
alsatia
but
my
father
shall
trouble
you
no
so
saying
she
entered
the
apartment
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
casket
she
said
with
emphasis
if
you
display
such
a
loadstone
it
will
draw
many
a
steel
knife
to
your
while
nigel
hastily
shut
the
casket
she
addressed
her
father
upbraiding
him
with
small
reverence
for
keeping
company
with
the
cowardly
hectoring
murdering
villain
john
colepepper
ay
ay
child
said
the
old
man
with
the
cunning
leer
which
intimated
perfect
satisfaction
with
his
own
superior
address
i
know
i
know
ugh
but
i
crossbite
him
i
know
them
all
and
i
can
manage
them
ay
ay
i
have
the
trick
o
manage
father
said
the
austere
damsel
you
will
manage
to
have
your
throat
cut
and
that
ere
long
you
can
not
hide
from
them
your
gains
and
your
gold
as
my
gains
wench
my
gold
said
the
usurer
few
of
these
and
hard
got
few
and
hard
this
will
not
serve
you
father
any
longer
said
she
and
had
not
served
you
thus
long
but
that
bully
colepepper
had
contrived
a
cheaper
way
of
plundering
your
house
even
by
means
of
my
miserable
but
why
do
i
speak
to
him
of
all
this
she
said
checking
herself
and
shrugging
her
shoulders
with
an
expression
of
pity
which
did
not
fall
much
short
of
scorn
he
hears
me
not
he
thinks
not
of
is
it
not
strange
that
the
love
of
gathering
gold
should
survive
the
care
to
preserve
both
property
and
life
your
father
said
lord
glenvarloch
who
could
not
help
respecting
the
strong
sense
and
feeling
shown
by
this
poor
woman
even
amidst
all
her
rudeness
and
severity
your
father
seems
to
have
his
faculties
sufficiently
alert
when
he
is
in
the
exercise
of
his
ordinary
pursuits
and
functions
i
wonder
he
is
not
sensible
of
the
weight
of
your
nature
made
him
a
man
senseless
of
danger
and
that
insensibility
is
the
best
thing
i
have
derived
from
him
said
she
age
has
left
him
shrewdness
enough
to
tread
his
old
beaten
paths
but
not
to
seek
new
courses
the
old
blind
horse
will
long
continue
to
go
its
rounds
in
the
mill
when
it
would
stumble
in
the
open
daughter
why
wench
why
housewife
said
the
old
man
awakening
out
of
some
dream
in
which
he
had
been
sneering
and
chuckling
in
imagination
probably
over
a
successful
piece
of
roguery
go
to
chamber
wench
go
to
chamber
draw
bolts
and
chain
look
sharp
to
door
let
none
in
or
out
but
worshipful
master
grahame
i
must
take
my
cloak
and
go
to
duke
hildebrod
ay
ay
time
has
been
my
own
warrant
was
enough
but
the
lower
we
lie
the
more
are
we
under
the
and
with
his
wonted
chorus
of
muttering
and
coughing
the
old
man
left
the
apartment
his
daughter
stood
for
a
moment
looking
after
him
with
her
usual
expression
of
discontent
and
sorrow
you
ought
to
persuade
your
father
said
nigel
to
leave
this
evil
neighbourhood
if
you
are
in
reality
apprehensive
for
his
he
would
be
safe
in
no
other
quarter
said
the
daughter
i
would
rather
the
old
man
were
dead
than
publicly
dishonoured
in
other
quarters
he
would
be
pelted
and
pursued
like
an
owl
which
ventures
into
sunshine
here
he
was
safe
while
his
comrades
could
avail
themselves
of
his
talents
he
is
now
squeezed
and
fleeced
by
them
on
every
pretence
they
consider
him
as
a
vessel
on
the
strand
from
which
each
may
snatch
a
prey
and
the
very
jealousy
which
they
entertain
respecting
him
as
a
common
property
may
perhaps
induce
them
to
guard
him
from
more
private
and
daring
still
methinks
you
ought
to
leave
this
place
answered
nigel
since
you
might
find
a
safe
retreat
in
some
distant
in
scotland
doubtless
said
she
looking
at
him
with
a
sharp
and
suspicious
eye
and
enrich
strangers
with
our
rescued
wealth
ha
young
man
madam
if
you
knew
me
said
lord
glenvarloch
you
would
spare
the
suspicion
implied
in
your
who
shall
assure
me
of
that
said
martha
sharply
they
say
you
are
a
brawler
and
a
gamester
and
i
know
how
far
these
are
to
be
trusted
by
the
they
do
me
wrong
by
heaven
said
lord
glenvarloch
it
may
be
so
said
martha
i
am
little
interested
in
the
degree
of
your
vice
or
your
folly
but
it
is
plain
that
the
one
or
the
other
has
conducted
you
hither
and
that
your
best
hope
of
peace
safety
and
happiness
is
to
be
gone
with
the
least
possible
delay
from
a
place
which
is
always
a
sty
for
swine
and
often
a
so
saying
she
left
the
apartment
there
was
something
in
the
ungracious
manner
of
this
female
amounting
almost
to
contempt
of
him
she
spoke
to
an
indignity
to
which
glenvarloch
notwithstanding
his
poverty
had
not
as
yet
been
personally
exposed
and
which
therefore
gave
him
a
transitory
feeling
of
painful
surprise
neither
did
the
dark
hints
which
martha
threw
out
concerning
the
danger
of
his
place
of
refuge
sound
by
any
means
agreeably
to
his
ears
the
bravest
man
placed
in
a
situation
in
which
he
is
surrounded
by
suspicious
persons
and
removed
from
all
counsel
and
assistance
except
those
afforded
by
a
valiant
heart
and
a
strong
arm
experiences
a
sinking
of
the
spirit
a
consciousness
of
abandonment
which
for
a
moment
chills
his
blood
and
depresses
his
natural
gallantry
of
disposition
but
if
sad
reflections
arose
in
nigel
mind
he
had
not
time
to
indulge
them
and
if
he
saw
little
prospect
of
finding
friends
in
alsatia
he
found
that
he
was
not
likely
to
be
solitary
for
lack
of
visitors
he
had
scarcely
paced
his
apartment
for
ten
minutes
endeavouring
to
arrange
his
ideas
on
the
course
which
he
was
to
pursue
on
quitting
alsatia
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sovereign
of
the
quarter
the
great
duke
hildebrod
himself
before
whose
approach
the
bolts
and
chains
of
the
miser
dwelling
fell
or
withdrew
as
of
their
own
accord
and
both
the
folding
leaves
of
the
door
were
opened
that
he
might
roll
himself
into
the
house
like
a
huge
butt
of
liquor
a
vessel
to
which
he
bore
a
considerable
outward
resemblance
both
in
size
shape
complexion
and
contents
to
your
lordship
said
the
greasy
puncheon
cocking
his
single
eye
and
rolling
it
upon
nigel
with
a
singular
expression
of
familiar
impudence
whilst
his
grim
which
was
close
at
his
heels
made
a
kind
of
gurgling
in
his
throat
as
if
saluting
in
similar
fashion
a
starved
cat
the
only
living
thing
in
trapbois
house
which
we
have
not
yet
enumerated
and
which
had
flown
up
to
the
top
of
the
tester
where
she
stood
clutching
and
grinning
at
the
mastiff
whose
greeting
she
accepted
with
as
much
as
nigel
bestowed
on
that
of
the
dog
master
peace
belzie
d
n
thee
peace
said
duke
hildebrod
beasts
and
fools
will
be
meddling
my
i
thought
sir
answered
nigel
with
as
much
haughtiness
as
was
consistent
with
the
cool
distance
which
he
desired
to
preserve
i
thought
i
had
told
you
my
name
at
present
was
nigel
his
eminence
of
whitefriars
on
this
burst
out
into
a
loud
chuckling
impudent
laugh
repeating
the
word
till
his
voice
was
almost
inarticulate
niggle
green
niggle
green
niggle
green
why
my
lord
you
would
be
queered
in
the
drinking
of
a
penny
pot
of
malmsey
if
you
cry
before
you
are
touched
why
you
have
told
me
the
secret
even
now
had
i
not
had
a
shrewd
guess
of
it
before
why
master
nigel
since
that
is
the
word
i
only
called
you
my
lord
because
we
made
you
a
peer
of
alsatia
last
night
when
the
sack
was
how
you
look
now
ha
ha
ha
nigel
indeed
conscious
that
he
had
unnecessarily
betrayed
himself
replied
hastily
he
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
the
honours
conferred
but
did
not
propose
to
remain
in
the
sanctuary
long
enough
to
enjoy
why
that
may
be
as
you
will
an
you
will
walk
by
wise
counsel
answered
the
ducal
porpoise
and
although
nigel
remained
standing
in
hopes
to
accelerate
his
guest
departure
he
threw
himself
into
one
of
the
old
which
cracked
under
his
weight
and
began
to
call
for
old
trapbois
the
crone
of
all
work
appearing
instead
of
her
master
the
duke
cursed
her
for
a
careless
jade
to
let
a
strange
gentleman
and
a
brave
guest
go
without
his
morning
draught
i
never
take
one
sir
said
glenvarloch
time
to
begin
time
to
begin
answered
the
here
you
old
refuse
of
sathan
go
to
our
palace
and
fetch
lord
green
morning
draught
let
us
see
what
shall
it
be
my
lord
a
humming
double
pot
of
ale
with
a
roasted
crab
dancing
in
it
like
a
wherry
above
bridge
or
hum
ay
young
men
are
a
quart
of
burnt
sack
with
sugar
and
spice
good
against
the
fogs
or
what
say
you
to
sipping
a
gill
of
right
distilled
waters
come
we
will
have
them
all
and
you
shall
take
your
here
you
jezebel
let
tim
send
the
ale
and
the
sack
and
the
nipperkin
of
with
a
bit
of
or
some
such
trinket
and
score
it
to
the
new
glenvarloch
bethinking
himself
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
endure
this
fellow
insolence
for
a
brief
season
as
to
get
into
farther
discreditable
quarrels
suffered
him
to
take
his
own
way
without
interruption
only
observing
you
make
yourself
at
home
sir
in
my
apartment
but
for
the
time
you
may
use
your
pleasure
meanwhile
i
would
fain
know
what
has
procured
me
the
honour
of
this
unexpected
visit
you
shall
know
that
when
old
deb
has
brought
the
liquor
i
never
speak
of
business
why
how
she
drumbles
i
warrant
she
stops
to
take
a
sip
on
the
road
and
then
you
will
think
you
have
had
unchristian
in
the
meanwhile
look
at
that
dog
there
look
belzebub
in
the
face
and
tell
me
if
you
ever
saw
a
sweeter
beast
never
flew
but
at
head
in
his
and
after
this
congenial
panegyric
he
was
proceeding
with
a
tale
of
a
dog
and
a
bull
which
threatened
to
be
somewhat
of
the
longest
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
the
old
crone
and
two
of
his
own
tapsters
bearing
the
various
kinds
of
drinkables
which
he
had
demanded
and
which
probably
was
the
only
species
of
interruption
he
would
have
endured
with
equanimity
when
the
cups
and
cans
were
duly
arranged
upon
the
table
and
when
deborah
whom
the
ducal
generosity
honoured
with
a
penny
farthing
in
the
way
of
gratuity
had
withdrawn
with
her
satellites
the
worthy
potentate
having
first
slightly
invited
lord
glenvarloch
to
partake
of
the
liquor
which
he
was
to
pay
for
and
after
having
observed
that
excepting
three
poached
eggs
a
pint
of
bastard
and
a
cup
of
clary
he
was
fasting
from
every
thing
but
sin
set
himself
seriously
to
reinforce
the
radical
moisture
glenvarloch
had
seen
scottish
lairds
and
dutch
burgomasters
at
their
potations
but
their
exploits
though
each
might
be
termed
a
thirsty
generation
were
nothing
to
those
of
duke
hildebrod
who
seemed
an
absolute
sandbed
capable
of
absorbing
any
given
quantity
of
liquid
without
being
either
vivified
or
overflowed
he
drank
off
the
ale
to
quench
a
thirst
which
as
he
said
kept
him
in
a
fever
from
morning
to
night
and
night
to
morning
tippled
off
the
sack
to
correct
the
crudity
of
the
ale
sent
the
spirits
after
the
sack
to
keep
all
quiet
and
then
declared
that
probably
he
should
not
taste
liquor
till
unless
it
was
in
compliment
to
some
especial
friend
finally
he
intimated
that
he
was
ready
to
proceed
on
the
business
which
brought
him
from
home
so
early
a
proposition
which
nigel
readily
received
though
he
could
not
help
suspecting
that
the
most
important
purpose
of
duke
hildebrod
visit
was
already
transacted
in
this
however
lord
glenvarloch
proved
to
be
mistaken
hildebrod
before
opening
what
he
had
to
say
made
an
accurate
survey
of
the
apartment
laying
from
time
to
time
his
finger
on
his
nose
and
winking
on
nigel
with
his
single
eye
while
he
opened
and
shut
the
doors
lifted
the
tapestry
which
concealed
in
one
or
two
places
the
dilapidation
of
time
upon
the
wainscoted
walls
peeped
into
closets
and
finally
looked
under
the
bed
to
assure
himself
that
the
coast
was
clear
of
listeners
and
interlopers
he
then
resumed
his
seat
and
beckoned
confidentially
to
nigel
to
draw
his
chair
close
to
him
i
am
well
as
i
am
master
hildebrod
replied
the
young
lord
little
disposed
to
encourage
the
familiarity
which
the
man
endeavoured
to
fix
on
him
but
the
undismayed
duke
proceeded
as
follows
you
shall
pardon
me
my
lord
and
i
now
give
you
the
title
right
seriously
if
i
remind
you
that
our
waters
may
be
watched
for
though
old
trapbois
be
as
deaf
as
saint
paul
yet
his
daughter
has
sharp
ears
and
sharp
eyes
enough
and
it
is
of
them
that
it
is
my
business
to
say
away
then
sir
said
nigel
edging
his
chair
somewhat
closer
to
the
quicksand
although
i
can
not
conceive
what
business
i
have
either
with
mine
host
or
his
we
will
see
that
in
the
twinkling
of
a
answered
the
gracious
duke
and
first
my
lord
you
must
not
think
to
dance
in
a
net
before
old
jack
hildebrod
that
has
thrice
your
years
his
head
and
was
born
like
king
richard
with
all
his
ready
well
sir
go
on
said
nigel
why
then
my
lord
i
presume
to
say
that
if
you
are
as
i
believe
you
are
that
lord
glenvarloch
whom
all
the
world
talk
of
the
scotch
gallant
that
has
spent
all
to
a
thin
cloak
and
a
light
purse
be
not
moved
my
lord
it
is
so
noised
of
you
men
call
you
the
who
will
fly
at
all
ay
were
it
in
the
very
park
be
not
moved
my
i
am
ashamed
sirrah
replied
glenvarloch
that
you
should
have
power
to
move
me
by
your
insolence
but
beware
and
if
you
indeed
guess
who
i
am
consider
how
long
i
may
be
able
to
endure
your
tone
of
insolent
i
crave
pardon
my
lord
said
hildebrod
with
a
sullen
yet
apologetic
look
i
meant
no
harm
in
speaking
my
poor
mind
i
know
not
what
honour
there
may
be
in
being
familiar
with
your
lordship
but
i
judge
there
is
little
safety
for
lowestoffe
is
laid
up
in
lavender
only
for
having
shown
you
the
way
into
alsatia
and
so
what
is
to
come
of
those
who
maintain
you
when
you
are
here
or
whether
they
will
get
most
honour
or
most
trouble
by
doing
so
i
leave
with
your
lordship
better
i
will
bring
no
one
into
trouble
on
my
account
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
will
leave
whitefriars
nay
by
heaven
i
will
leave
it
this
you
will
have
more
wit
in
your
anger
i
trust
said
duke
hildebrod
listen
first
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
and
if
honest
jack
hildebrod
puts
you
not
in
the
way
of
nicking
them
all
may
he
never
cast
doublets
or
dull
a
greenhorn
again
and
so
my
lord
in
plain
words
you
must
wap
and
your
words
must
be
still
plainer
before
i
can
understand
them
said
nigel
what
the
devil
a
gamester
one
who
deals
with
the
devil
bones
and
the
doctors
and
not
understand
pedlar
french
nay
then
i
must
speak
plain
english
and
that
the
simpleton
speak
then
sir
said
nigel
and
i
pray
you
be
brief
for
i
have
little
more
time
to
bestow
on
well
then
my
lord
to
be
brief
as
you
and
the
lawyers
call
it
i
understand
you
have
an
estate
in
the
north
which
changes
masters
for
want
of
the
redeeming
ay
you
start
but
you
can
not
dance
in
a
net
before
me
as
i
said
before
and
so
the
king
runs
the
frowning
humour
on
you
and
the
court
vapours
you
the
and
the
prince
scowls
at
you
from
under
his
cap
and
the
favourite
serves
you
out
the
puckered
brow
and
the
cold
shoulder
and
the
favourite
favourite
to
go
no
further
sir
interrupted
nigel
suppose
all
this
true
and
what
follows
what
follows
returned
duke
hildebrod
marry
this
follows
that
you
will
owe
good
deed
as
well
as
good
will
to
him
who
shall
put
you
in
the
way
to
walk
with
your
beaver
cocked
in
the
presence
as
an
ye
were
earl
of
kildare
bully
the
courtiers
meet
the
prince
blighting
look
with
a
bold
brow
confront
the
favourite
baffle
his
deputy
and
this
is
all
well
said
nigel
but
how
is
it
to
be
accomplished
by
making
thee
a
prince
of
peru
my
lord
of
the
northern
latitudes
propping
thine
old
castle
with
ingots
fertilizing
thy
failing
fortunes
with
gold
dust
it
shall
but
cost
thee
to
put
thy
baron
coronet
for
a
day
or
so
on
the
brows
of
an
old
caduca
here
the
man
daughter
of
the
house
and
thou
art
master
of
a
mass
of
treasure
that
shall
do
all
i
have
said
for
thee
and
what
you
would
have
me
marry
this
old
gentlewoman
here
the
daughter
of
mine
host
said
nigel
surprised
and
angry
yet
unable
to
suppress
some
desire
to
laugh
nay
my
lord
i
would
have
you
marry
fifty
thousand
good
sterling
pounds
for
that
and
better
hath
old
trapbois
hoarded
and
thou
shall
do
a
deed
of
mercy
in
it
to
the
old
man
who
will
lose
his
golden
smelts
in
some
worse
way
for
now
that
he
is
past
his
day
of
work
his
day
of
payment
is
like
to
truly
this
is
a
most
courteous
offer
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
may
i
pray
of
your
candour
most
noble
duke
to
tell
me
why
you
dispose
of
a
ward
of
so
much
wealth
on
a
stranger
like
me
who
may
leave
you
in
sooth
my
lord
said
the
duke
that
question
smacks
more
of
the
wit
of
beaujeu
ordinary
than
any
word
i
have
yet
heard
your
lordship
speak
and
reason
it
is
you
should
be
answered
touching
my
peers
it
is
but
necessary
to
say
that
mistress
martha
trapbois
will
none
of
them
whether
clerical
or
laic
the
captain
hath
asked
her
so
hath
the
parson
but
she
will
none
of
them
she
looks
higher
than
either
and
is
to
say
truth
a
woman
of
sense
and
so
forth
too
profound
and
of
spirit
something
too
high
to
put
up
with
greasy
buff
or
rusty
prunella
for
ourselves
we
need
but
hint
that
we
have
a
consort
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
what
is
more
to
purpose
martha
knows
it
so
as
she
will
not
lace
her
kersey
hood
save
with
a
quality
binding
you
my
lord
must
be
the
man
and
must
carry
off
fifty
thousand
decuses
the
spoils
of
five
thousand
bullies
cutters
and
spendthrifts
always
deducting
from
the
main
sum
some
five
thousand
pounds
for
our
princely
advice
and
countenance
without
which
as
matters
stand
in
alsatia
you
would
find
it
hard
to
win
the
but
has
your
wisdom
considered
sir
replied
glenvarloch
how
this
wedlock
can
serve
me
in
my
present
emergence
as
for
that
my
lord
said
duke
hildebrod
if
with
forty
or
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
your
pouch
you
can
not
save
yourself
you
will
deserve
to
lose
your
head
for
your
folly
and
your
hand
for
being
but
since
your
goodness
has
taken
my
matters
into
such
serious
consideration
continued
nigel
who
conceived
there
was
no
prudence
in
breaking
with
a
man
who
in
his
way
meant
him
favour
rather
than
offence
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
tell
me
how
my
kindred
will
be
likely
to
receive
such
a
bride
as
you
recommend
to
me
touching
that
matter
my
lord
i
have
always
heard
your
countrymen
knew
as
well
as
other
folks
on
which
side
their
bread
was
buttered
and
truly
speaking
from
report
i
know
no
place
where
fifty
thousand
pounds
fifty
thousand
pounds
i
say
will
make
a
woman
more
welcome
than
it
is
likely
to
do
in
your
ancient
kingdom
and
truly
saving
the
slight
twist
in
her
shoulder
martha
trapbois
is
a
person
of
very
awful
and
majestic
appearance
and
may
for
aught
i
know
be
come
of
better
blood
than
any
one
wots
of
for
old
trapbois
looks
not
over
like
to
be
her
father
and
her
mother
was
a
generous
liberal
sort
of
a
i
am
afraid
answered
nigel
that
chance
is
rather
too
vague
to
assure
her
a
gracious
reception
into
an
honourable
why
then
my
lord
replied
hildebrod
i
think
it
like
she
will
be
even
with
them
for
i
will
venture
to
say
she
has
as
much
as
will
make
her
a
match
for
your
whole
that
may
inconvenience
me
a
little
replied
nigel
not
a
whit
not
a
whit
said
the
duke
fertile
in
expedients
if
she
should
become
rather
intolerable
which
is
not
unlikely
your
honourable
house
which
i
presume
to
be
a
castle
hath
doubtless
both
turrets
and
dungeons
and
ye
may
bestow
your
bonny
bride
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
and
then
you
know
you
will
be
out
of
hearing
of
her
tongue
and
she
will
be
either
above
or
below
the
contempt
of
your
it
is
sagely
counselled
most
equitable
sir
replied
nigel
and
such
restraint
would
be
a
fit
meed
for
her
folly
that
gave
me
any
power
over
you
entertain
the
project
then
my
lord
said
duke
hildebrod
i
must
turn
it
in
my
mind
for
hours
said
nigel
and
i
will
pray
you
so
to
order
matters
that
i
be
not
further
interrupted
by
any
we
will
utter
an
edict
to
secure
your
privacy
said
the
duke
and
you
do
not
think
he
added
lowering
his
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
that
ten
thousand
is
too
much
to
pay
to
the
sovereign
in
name
of
wardship
ten
thousand
said
lord
glenvarloch
why
you
said
five
thousand
but
aha
art
avised
of
that
said
the
duke
touching
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
finger
nay
if
you
have
marked
me
so
closely
you
are
thinking
on
the
case
more
nearly
than
i
believed
till
you
trapped
me
well
well
we
will
not
quarrel
about
the
consideration
as
old
trapbois
would
call
it
do
you
win
and
wear
the
dame
it
will
be
no
hard
matter
with
your
face
and
figure
and
i
will
take
care
that
no
one
interrupts
you
i
will
have
an
edict
from
the
senate
as
soon
as
they
meet
for
their
so
saying
duke
hildebrod
took
his
leave
chapter
xxiv
this
is
the
time

do
thou
bare

and
follow
me
for
we

and
do
it
darkness
like
this
is
dawning
of
our
fortunes
when
duke
hildebrod
had
withdrawn
nigel
first
impulse
was
an
irresistible
feeling
to
laugh
at
the
sage
adviser
who
would
have
thus
connected
him
with
age
ugliness
and
but
his
next
thought
was
pity
for
the
unfortunate
father
and
daughter
who
being
the
only
persons
possessed
of
wealth
in
this
unhappy
district
seemed
like
a
wreck
on
the
of
a
barbarous
country
only
secured
from
plunder
for
the
moment
by
the
jealousy
of
the
tribes
among
whom
it
had
been
cast
neither
could
he
help
being
conscious
that
his
own
residence
here
was
upon
conditions
equally
precarious
and
that
he
was
considered
by
the
alsatians
in
the
same
light
of
a
godsend
on
the
cornish
coast
or
a
sickly
but
wealthy
caravan
travelling
through
the
wilds
of
africa
and
emphatically
termed
by
the
nations
of
despoilers
through
whose
regions
it
passes
which
signifies
a
thing
given
to
be
devoured
a
common
prey
to
all
men
nigel
had
already
formed
his
own
plan
to
extricate
himself
at
whatever
risk
from
his
perilous
and
degrading
situation
and
in
order
that
he
might
carry
it
into
instant
execution
he
only
awaited
the
return
of
lowestoffe
messenger
he
expected
him
however
in
vain
and
could
only
amuse
himself
by
looking
through
such
parts
of
his
baggage
as
had
been
sent
to
him
from
his
former
lodgings
in
order
to
select
a
small
packet
of
the
most
necessary
articles
to
take
with
him
in
the
event
of
his
quitting
his
lodgings
secretly
and
suddenly
as
speed
and
privacy
would
he
foresaw
be
particularly
necessary
if
he
meant
to
obtain
an
interview
with
the
king
which
was
the
course
his
spirit
and
his
interest
alike
determined
him
to
pursue
while
he
was
thus
engaged
he
found
greatly
to
his
satisfaction
that
master
lowestoffe
had
transmitted
not
only
his
rapier
and
poniard
but
a
pair
of
pistols
which
he
had
used
in
travelling
of
a
smaller
and
more
convenient
size
than
the
large
petronels
or
horse
pistols
which
were
then
in
common
use
as
being
made
for
wearing
at
the
girdle
or
in
the
pockets
next
to
having
stout
and
friendly
comrades
a
man
is
chiefly
emboldened
by
finding
himself
well
armed
in
case
of
need
and
nigel
who
had
thought
with
some
anxiety
on
the
hazard
of
trusting
his
life
if
attacked
to
the
protection
of
the
clumsy
weapon
with
which
lowestoffe
had
equipped
him
in
order
to
complete
his
disguise
felt
an
emotion
of
confidence
approaching
to
triumph
as
drawing
his
own
good
and
rapier
he
wiped
it
with
his
handkerchief
examined
its
point
bent
it
once
or
twice
against
the
ground
to
prove
its
metal
and
finally
replaced
it
in
the
scabbard
the
more
hastily
that
he
heard
a
tap
at
the
door
of
his
chamber
and
had
no
mind
to
be
found
vapouring
in
the
apartment
with
his
sword
drawn
it
was
his
old
host
who
entered
to
tell
him
with
many
cringes
that
the
price
of
his
apartment
was
to
be
a
crown
per
diem
and
that
according
to
the
custom
of
whitefriars
the
rent
was
always
payable
per
advance
although
he
never
scrupled
to
let
the
money
lie
till
a
week
or
fortnight
or
even
a
month
in
the
hands
of
any
honourable
guest
like
master
grahame
always
upon
some
reasonable
consideration
for
the
use
nigel
got
rid
of
the
old
dotard
intrusion
by
throwing
down
two
pieces
of
gold
and
requesting
the
accommodation
of
his
present
apartment
for
eight
days
adding
however
he
did
not
think
he
should
tarry
so
long
the
miser
with
a
sparkling
eye
and
a
trembling
hand
clutched
fast
the
proffered
coin
and
having
balanced
the
pieces
with
exquisite
pleasure
on
the
extremity
of
his
withered
finger
began
almost
instantly
to
show
that
not
even
the
possession
of
gold
can
gratify
for
more
than
an
instant
the
very
heart
that
is
most
eager
in
the
pursuit
of
it
first
the
pieces
might
be
light
with
hasty
hand
he
drew
a
small
pair
of
scales
from
his
bosom
and
weighed
them
first
together
then
separately
and
smiled
with
glee
as
he
saw
them
attain
the
due
depression
in
the
balance
a
circumstance
which
might
add
to
his
profits
if
it
were
true
as
was
currently
reported
that
little
of
the
gold
coinage
was
current
in
alsatia
in
a
perfect
state
and
that
none
ever
left
the
sanctuary
in
that
condition
another
fear
then
occurred
to
trouble
the
old
miser
pleasure
he
had
been
just
able
to
comprehend
that
nigel
intended
to
leave
the
friars
sooner
than
the
arrival
of
the
term
for
which
he
had
deposited
the
rent
this
might
imply
an
expectation
of
refunding
which
as
a
scotch
wag
said
of
all
species
of
funding
jumped
least
with
the
old
humour
he
was
beginning
to
enter
a
hypothetical
caveat
on
this
subject
and
to
quote
several
reasons
why
no
part
of
the
money
once
consigned
as
could
be
repaid
back
on
any
pretence
without
great
hardship
to
the
landlord
when
nigel
growing
impatient
told
him
that
the
money
was
his
absolutely
and
without
any
intention
on
his
part
of
resuming
any
of
it
all
he
asked
in
return
was
the
liberty
of
enjoying
in
private
the
apartment
he
had
paid
for
old
trapbois
who
had
still
at
his
tongue
end
much
of
the
smooth
language
by
which
in
his
time
he
had
hastened
the
ruin
of
many
a
young
spendthrift
began
to
launch
out
upon
the
noble
and
generous
disposition
of
his
new
guest
until
nigel
growing
impatient
took
the
old
gentleman
by
the
hand
and
gently
yet
irresistibly
leading
him
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
put
him
out
but
with
such
decent
and
moderate
exertion
of
his
superior
strength
as
to
render
the
action
in
no
shape
indecorous
and
fastening
the
door
began
to
do
that
for
his
pistols
which
he
had
done
for
his
favourite
sword
examining
with
care
the
flints
and
locks
and
reviewing
the
state
of
his
small
provision
of
ammunition
in
this
operation
he
was
a
second
time
interrupted
by
a
knocking
at
the
door
he
called
upon
the
person
to
enter
having
no
doubt
that
it
was
lowestoffe
messenger
at
length
arrived
it
was
however
the
ungracious
daughter
of
old
trapbois
who
muttering
something
about
her
father
mistake
laid
down
upon
the
table
one
of
the
pieces
of
gold
which
nigel
had
just
given
to
him
saying
that
what
she
retained
was
the
full
rent
for
the
term
he
had
specified
nigel
replied
he
had
paid
the
money
and
had
no
desire
to
receive
it
again
do
as
you
will
with
it
then
replied
his
hostess
for
there
it
lies
and
shall
lie
for
me
if
you
are
fool
enough
to
pay
more
than
is
reason
my
father
shall
not
be
knave
enough
to
take
but
your
father
mistress
said
nigel
your
father
told
me
oh
my
father
my
father
said
she
interrupting
him
my
father
managed
these
affairs
while
he
was
able
i
manage
them
now
and
that
may
in
the
long
run
be
as
well
for
both
of
she
then
looked
on
the
table
and
observed
the
weapons
you
have
arms
i
see
she
said
do
you
know
how
to
use
them
i
should
do
so
mistress
replied
nigel
for
it
has
been
my
you
are
a
soldier
then
she
demanded
no
farther
as
yet
than
as
every
gentleman
of
my
country
is
a
ay
that
is
your
point
of
honour
to
cut
the
throats
of
the
poor
a
proper
gentlemanlike
occupation
for
those
who
should
protect
them
i
do
not
deal
in
cutting
throats
mistress
replied
nigel
but
i
carry
arms
to
defend
myself
and
my
country
if
it
needs
ay
replied
martha
it
is
fairly
worded
but
men
say
you
are
as
prompt
as
others
in
petty
brawls
where
neither
your
safety
nor
your
country
is
in
hazard
and
that
had
it
not
been
so
you
would
not
have
been
in
the
sanctuary
mistress
returned
nigel
i
should
labour
in
vain
to
make
you
understand
that
a
man
honour
which
is
or
should
be
dearer
to
him
than
his
life
may
often
call
on
and
compel
us
to
hazard
our
own
lives
or
those
of
others
on
what
would
otherwise
seem
trifling
god
law
says
nought
of
that
said
the
female
i
have
only
read
there
that
thou
shall
not
kill
but
i
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
preach
to
you
you
will
find
enough
of
fighting
here
if
you
like
it
and
well
if
it
come
not
to
seek
you
when
you
are
least
prepared
farewell
for
the
present

your
commands
for
your
she
left
the
room
just
as
nigel
provoked
at
her
assuming
a
superior
tone
of
judgment
and
of
censure
was
about
to
be
so
superfluous
as
to
enter
into
a
dispute
with
an
old
pawnbroker
daughter
on
the
subject
of
the
point
of
honour
he
smiled
at
himself
for
the
folly
into
which
the
spirit
of
had
so
nearly
hurried
him
lord
glenvarloch
then
applied
to
old
deborah
the
by
whose
intermediation
he
was
provided
with
a
tolerably
decent
dinner
and
the
only
embarrassment
which
he
experienced
was
from
the
almost
forcible
entry
of
the
old
dotard
his
landlord
who
insisted
upon
giving
his
assistance
at
laying
the
cloth
nigel
had
some
difficulty
to
prevent
him
from
displacing
his
arms
and
some
papers
which
were
lying
on
a
small
table
at
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
nothing
short
of
a
stern
and
positive
injunction
to
the
contrary
could
compel
him
to
use
another
board
though
there
were
two
in
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
laying
the
cloth
having
at
length
obliged
him
to
relinquish
his
purpose
he
could
not
help
observing
that
the
eyes
of
the
old
dotard
seemed
still
anxiously
fixed
upon
the
small
table
on
which
lay
his
sword
and
pistols
and
that
amidst
all
the
little
duties
which
he
seemed
officiously
anxious
to
render
to
his
guest
he
took
every
opportunity
of
looking
towards
and
approaching
these
objects
of
his
attention
at
length
when
trapbois
thought
he
had
completely
avoided
the
notice
of
his
guest
nigel
through
the
observation
of
one
of
the
cracked
mirrors
oh
which
channel
of
communication
the
old
man
had
not
calculated
beheld
him
actually
extend
his
hand
towards
the
table
in
question
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
use
further
ceremony
but
telling
his
landlord
in
a
stern
voice
that
he
permitted
no
one
to
touch
his
arms
he
commanded
him
to
leave
the
apartment
the
old
usurer
commenced
a
maundering
sort
of
apology
in
which
all
that
nigel
distinctly
apprehended
was
a
frequent
repetition
of
the
word
and
which
did
not
seem
to
him
to
require
any
other
answer
than
a
reiteration
of
his
command
to
him
to
leave
the
apartment
upon
pain
of
worse
consequences
the
ancient
hebe
who
acted
as
lord
glenvarloch
took
his
part
against
the
intrusion
of
the
still
more
antiquated
ganymede
and
insisted
on
old
trapbois
leaving
the
room
instantly
menacing
him
at
the
same
time
with
her
mistress
displeasure
if
he
remained
there
any
longer
the
old
man
seemed
more
under
petticoat
government
than
any
other
for
the
threat
of
the
produced
greater
effect
upon
him
than
the
more
formidable
displeasure
of
nigel
he
withdrew
grumbling
and
muttering
and
lord
glenvarloch
heard
him
bar
a
large
door
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
gallery
which
served
as
a
division
betwixt
the
other
parts
of
the
extensive
mansion
and
the
apartment
occupied
by
his
guest
which
as
the
reader
is
aware
had
its
access
from
the
at
the
head
of
the
grand
staircase
nigel
accepted
the
careful
sound
of
the
bolts
and
bars
as
they
were
severally
drawn
by
the
trembling
hand
of
old
trapbois
as
an
omen
that
the
senior
did
not
mean
again
to
revisit
him
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
heartily
rejoiced
that
he
was
at
length
to
be
left
to
uninterrupted
solitude
the
old
woman
asked
if
there
was
aught
else
to
be
done
for
his
accommodation
and
indeed
it
had
hitherto
seemed
as
if
the
pleasure
of
serving
him
or
more
properly
the
reward
which
she
expected
had
renewed
her
youth
and
activity
nigel
desired
to
have
candles
to
have
a
fire
lighted
in
his
apartment
and
a
few
fagots
placed
beside
it
that
he
might
feed
it
from
time
to
time
as
he
began
to
feel
the
chilly
effects
of
the
damp
and
low
situation
of
the
house
close
as
it
was
to
the
thames
but
while
the
old
woman
was
absent
upon
his
errand
he
began
to
think
in
what
way
he
should
pass
the
long
solitary
evening
with
which
he
was
threatened
his
own
reflections
promised
to
nigel
little
amusement
and
less
applause
he
had
considered
his
own
perilous
situation
in
every
light
in
which
it
could
be
viewed
and
foresaw
as
little
utility
as
comfort
in
resuming
the
survey
to
divert
the
current
of
his
ideas
books
were
of
course
the
readiest
resource
and
although
like
most
of
us
nigel
had
in
his
time
sauntered
through
large
libraries
and
even
spent
a
long
time
there
without
greatly
disturbing
their
learned
contents
he
was
now
in
a
situation
where
the
possession
of
a
volume
even
of
very
inferior
merit
becomes
a
real
treasure
the
old
housewife
returned
shortly
afterwards
with
fagots
and
some
pieces
of
the
perquisites
probably
real
or
usurped
of
some
experienced
groom
of
the
chambers
two
of
which
she
placed
in
large
brass
candlesticks
of
different
shapes
and
patterns
and
laid
the
others
on
the
table
that
nigel
might
renew
them
from
time
to
time
as
they
burnt
to
the
socket
she
heard
with
interest
lord
glenvarloch
request
to
have
a
book
any
sort
of
book
to
pass
away
the
night
withal
and
returned
for
answer
that
she
knew
of
no
other
books
in
the
house
than
her
young
as
she
always
denominated
mistress
martha
trapbois
bible
which
the
owner
would
not
lend
and
her
master
whetstone
of
witte
being
the
second
part
of
arithmetic
by
robert
record
with
the
cossike
practice
and
rule
of
equation
which
promising
volume
nigel
declined
to
borrow
she
offered
however
to
bring
him
some
books
from
duke
hildebrod
who
sometimes
good
gentleman
gave
a
glance
at
a
book
when
the
state
affairs
of
alsatia
left
him
as
much
nigfil
embraced
the
proposal
and
his
unwearied
iris
scuttled
away
on
this
second
embassy
she
returned
in
a
short
time
with
a
tattered
quarto
volume
under
her
arm
and
a
bottle
of
sack
in
her
hand
for
the
duke
judging
that
mere
reading
was
dry
work
had
sent
the
wine
by
way
of
sauce
to
help
it
down
not
forgetting
to
add
the
price
to
the
score
which
he
had
already
run
up
against
the
stranger
in
the
sanctuary
nigel
seized
on
the
book
and
did
not
refuse
the
wine
thinking
that
a
glass
or
two
as
it
really
proved
to
be
of
good
quality
would
be
no
bad
interlude
to
his
studies
he
dismissed
with
thanks
and
assurance
of
reward
the
poor
old
drudge
who
had
been
so
zealous
in
his
service
trimmed
his
fire
and
candles
and
placed
the
easiest
of
the
old
in
a
convenient
posture
betwixt
the
fire
and
the
table
at
which
he
had
dined
and
which
now
supported
the
measure
of
sack
and
the
lights
and
thus
accompanying
his
studies
with
such
luxurious
appliances
as
were
in
his
power
he
began
to
examine
the
only
volume
with
which
the
ducal
library
of
alsatia
had
been
able
to
supply
him
the
contents
though
of
a
kind
generally
interesting
were
not
well
calculated
to
dispel
the
gloom
by
which
he
was
surrounded
the
book
was
entitled
god
revenge
against
murther
not
as
the
bibliomaniacal
reader
may
easily
conjecture
the
work
which
reynolds
published
under
that
imposing
name
but
one
of
a
much
earlier
date
printed
and
sold
by
old
wolfe
and
which
could
a
copy
now
be
found
would
sell
for
much
more
than
its
weight
in
gold
footnote
only
three
copies
are
known
to
exist
one
in
the
library
at
kennaquhair
and
two
one
foxed
and
cropped
the
other
tall
and
in
good
condition
both
in
the
possession
of
an
eminent
member
of
the
roxburghe
captain
clutterbuck
nigel
had
soon
enough
of
the
doleful
tales
which
the
book
contains
and
attempted
one
or
two
other
modes
of
killing
the
evening
he
looked
out
at
window
but
the
night
was
rainy
with
gusts
of
wind
he
tried
to
coax
the
fire
but
the
fagots
were
green
and
smoked
without
burning
and
as
he
was
naturally
temperate
he
felt
his
blood
somewhat
heated
by
the
canary
sack
which
he
had
already
drank
and
had
no
farther
inclination
to
that
pastime
he
next
attempted
to
compose
a
memorial
addressed
to
the
king
in
which
he
set
forth
his
case
and
his
grievances
but
speedily
stung
with
the
idea
that
his
supplication
would
be
treated
with
scorn
he
flung
the
scroll
into
the
fire
and
in
a
sort
of
desperation
resumed
the
book
which
he
had
laid
aside
nigel
became
more
interested
in
the
volume
at
the
second
than
at
the
first
attempt
which
he
made
to
peruse
it
the
narratives
strange
and
shocking
as
they
were
to
human
feeling
possessed
yet
the
interest
of
sorcery
or
of
fascination
which
rivets
the
attention
by
its
awakening
horrors
much
was
told
of
the
strange
and
horrible
acts
of
blood
by
which
men
setting
nature
and
humanity
alike
at
defiance
had
for
the
thirst
of
revenge
the
lust
of
gold
or
the
cravings
of
irregular
ambition
broken
into
the
tabernacle
of
life
yet
more
surprising
and
mysterious
tales
were
recounted
of
the
mode
in
which
such
deeds
of
blood
had
come
to
be
discovered
and
revenged
animals
irrational
animals
had
told
the
secret
and
birds
of
the
air
had
carried
the
matter
the
elements
had
seemed
to
betray
the
deed
which
had
polluted
them
earth
had
ceased
to
support
the
murderer
steps
fire
to
warm
his
frozen
limbs
water
to
refresh
his
parched
lips

to
relieve
his
gasping
lungs
all
in
short
bore
evidence
to
the
homicide
guilt
in
other
circumstances
the
criminal
own
awakened
conscience
pursued
and
brought
him
to
justice
and
in
some
narratives
the
grave
was
said
to
have
yawned
that
the
ghost
of
the
sufferer
might
call
for
revenge
it
was
now
wearing
late
in
the
night
and
the
book
was
still
in
hands
when
the
tapestry
which
hung
behind
him
flapped
against
the
wall
and
the
wind
produced
by
its
motion
waved
the
flame
of
the
candles
by
which
he
was
reading
nigel
started
and
turned
round
in
that
excited
and
irritated
state
of
mind
which
arose
from
the
nature
of
his
studies
especially
at
a
period
when
a
certain
degree
of
superstition
was
inculcated
as
a
point
of
religious
faith
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
he
saw
the
bloodless
countenance
meagre
form
and
ghastly
aspect
of
old
trapbois
once
more
in
the
very
act
of
extending
his
withered
hand
towards
the
table
which
supported
his
arms
convinced
by
this
untimely
apparition
that
something
evil
was
meditated
towards
him
nigel
sprung
up
seized
his
sword
drew
it
and
placing
it
at
the
old
breast
demanded
of
him
what
he
did
in
his
apartment
at
so
untimely
an
hour
trapbois
showed
neither
fear
nor
surprise
and
only
answered
by
some
imperfect
expressions
intimating
he
would
part
with
his
life
rather
than
with
his
property
and
lord
glenvarloch
strangely
embarrassed
knew
not
what
to
think
of
the
intruder
motives
and
still
less
how
to
get
rid
of
him
as
he
again
tried
the
means
of
intimidation
he
was
surprised
by
a
second
apparition
from
behind
the
tapestry
in
the
person
of
the
daughter
of
trapbois
bearing
a
lamp
in
her
hand
she
also
seemed
to
possess
her
father
insensibility
to
danger
for
coming
close
to
nigel
she
pushed
aside
impetuously
his
naked
sword
and
even
attempted
to
take
it
out
of
his
hand
for
shame
she
said
your
sword
on
a
man
of
eighty
years
and
more
the
honour
of
a
scottish
gentleman
give
it
to
me
to
make
a
spindle
of
stand
back
said
nigel
i
mean
your
father
no
injury
but
i
know
what
has
caused
him
to
prowl
this
whole
day
and
even
at
this
late
hour
of
night
around
my
your
arms
repeated
she
alas
young
man
the
whole
arms
in
the
tower
of
london
are
of
little
value
to
him
in
comparison
of
this
miserable
piece
of
gold
which
i
left
this
morning
on
the
table
of
a
young
spendthrift
too
careless
to
put
what
belonged
to
him
into
his
own
so
saying
she
showed
the
piece
of
gold
which
still
remaining
on
the
table
where
she
left
it
had
been
the
bait
that
attracted
old
trapbois
so
frequently
to
the
spot
and
which
even
in
the
silence
of
the
night
had
so
dwelt
on
his
imagination
that
he
had
made
use
of
a
private
passage
long
disused
to
enter
his
guest
apartment
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
the
treasure
during
his
slumbers
he
now
exclaimed
at
the
highest
tones
of
his
cracked
and
feeble
voice
it
is
mine
it
is
mine
he
gave
it
to
me
for
a
consideration
i
will
die
ere
i
part
with
my
property
it
is
indeed
his
own
mistress
said
nigel
and
i
do
entreat
you
to
restore
it
to
the
person
on
whom
i
have
bestowed
it
and
let
me
have
my
apartment
in
i
will
account
with
you
for
it
then
said
the
maiden
reluctantly
giving
to
her
father
the
morsel
of
mammon
on
which
he
darted
as
if
his
bony
fingers
had
been
the
talons
of
a
hawk
seizing
its
prey
and
then
making
a
contented
muttering
and
mumbling
like
an
old
dog
after
he
has
been
fed
and
just
when
he
is
wheeling
himself
thrice
round
for
the
purpose
of
lying
down
he
followed
his
daughter
behind
the
tapestry
through
a
little
which
was
perceived
when
the
hangings
were
drawn
apart
this
shall
be
properly
fastened
said
the
daughter
to
nigel
speaking
in
such
a
tone
that
her
father
deaf
and
engrossed
by
his
acquisition
could
not
hear
her
i
will
continue
to
watch
him
i
wish
you
good
these
few
words
pronounced
in
a
tone
of
more
civility
than
she
had
yet
made
use
of
towards
her
lodger
contained
a
wish
which
was
not
to
be
accomplished
although
her
guest
presently
after
her
departure
retired
to
bed
there
was
a
slight
fever
in
nigel
blood
occasioned
by
the
various
events
of
the
evening
which
put
him
as
the
phrase
is
beside
his
rest
perplexing
and
painful
thoughts
rolled
on
his
mind
like
a
troubled
stream
and
the
more
he
laboured
to
lull
himself
to
slumber
the
farther
he
seemed
from
attaining
his
object
he
tried
all
the
resources
common
in
such
cases
kept
counting
from
one
to
a
thousand
until
his
head
was
giddy
he
watched
the
embers
of
the
wood
fire
till
his
eyes
were
dazzled
he
listened
to
the
dull
moaning
of
the
wind
the
swinging
and
creaking
of
signs
which
projected
from
the
houses
and
the
baying
of
here
and
there
a
homeless
dog
till
his
very
ear
was
weary
suddenly
however
amid
this
monotony
came
a
sound
which
startled
him
at
once
it
was
a
female
shriek
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
to
listen
then
remembered
he
was
in
alsatia
where
brawls
of
every
sort
were
current
among
the
unruly
inhabitants
but
another
scream
and
another
and
another
succeeded
so
close
that
he
was
certain
though
the
noise
was
remote
and
sounded
stifled
it
must
be
in
the
same
house
with
himself
nigel
jumped
up
hastily
put
on
a
part
of
his
clothes
seized
his
sword
and
pistols
and
ran
to
the
door
of
his
chamber
here
he
plainly
heard
the
screams
redoubled
and
as
he
thought
the
sounds
came
from
the
usurer
apartment
all
access
to
the
gallery
was
effectually
excluded
by
the
intermediate
door
which
the
brave
young
lord
shook
with
eager
but
vain
impatience
but
the
secret
passage
occurred
suddenly
to
his
recollection
he
hastened
back
to
his
room
and
succeeded
with
some
difficulty
in
lighting
a
candle
powerfully
agitated
by
hearing
the
cries
repeated
yet
still
more
afraid
lest
they
should
sink
into
silence
he
rushed
along
the
narrow
and
winding
entrance
guided
by
the
noise
which
now
burst
more
wildly
on
his
ear
and
while
he
descended
a
narrow
staircase
which
terminated
the
passage
he
heard
the
stifled
voices
of
men
encouraging
as
it
seemed
each
other
d
n
her
strike
her
down
silence
her
beat
her
brains
out
while
the
voice
of
his
hostess
though
now
almost
exhausted
was
repeating
the
cry
of
murder
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
was
a
small
door
which
gave
way
before
nigel
as
he
precipitated
himself
upon
the
scene
of
action
a
cocked
pistol
in
one
hand
a
candle
in
the
other
and
his
naked
sword
under
his
arm
two
ruffians
had
with
great
difficulty
overpowered
or
rather
were
on
the
point
of
overpowering
the
daughter
of
trapbois
whose
resistance
appeared
to
have
been
most
desperate
for
the
floor
was
covered
with
fragments
of
her
clothes
and
handfuls
of
her
hair
it
appeared
that
her
life
was
about
to
be
the
price
of
her
defence
for
one
villain
had
drawn
a
long
when
they
were
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
nigel
who
as
they
turned
towards
him
shot
the
fellow
with
the
knife
dead
on
the
spot
and
when
the
other
advanced
to
him
hurled
the
candlestick
at
his
head
and
then
attacked
him
with
his
sword
it
was
dark
save
some
pale
moonlight
from
the
window
and
the
ruffian
after
firing
a
pistol
without
effect
and
fighting
a
traverse
or
two
with
his
sword
lost
heart
made
for
the
window
leaped
over
it
and
escaped
nigel
fired
his
remaining
pistol
after
him
at
a
venture
and
then
called
for
light
there
is
light
in
the
kitchen
answered
martha
trapbois
with
more
presence
of
mind
than
could
have
been
expected
stay
you
know
not
the
way
i
will
fetch
it
oh
my
father
my
poor
father
i
knew
it
would
come
to
this
and
all
along
of
the
accursed
gold

have

xxv
death
finds
us
our
playthings
snatches
us
as
a
cross
nurse
might
do
a
wayward
child
from
all
our
toys
and
baubles
his
rough
call
unlooses
all
our

ties
on
earth
and
well
if
they
are
such
as
may
be
in
yonder
world
where
all
is
judged
of
truly
it
was
a
ghastly
scene
which
opened
upon
martha
trapbois
return
with
a
light
her
own
haggard
and
austere
features
were
exaggerated
by
all
the
desperation
of
grief
fear
and
passion
but
the
latter
was
predominant
on
the
floor
lay
the
body
of
the
robber
who
had
expired
without
a
groan
while
his
blood
flowing
plentifully
had
crimsoned
all
around
another
body
lay
also
there
on
which
the
unfortunate
woman
precipitated
herself
in
agony
for
it
was
that
of
her
unhappy
father
in
the
next
moment
she
started
up
and
exclaiming
there
may
be
life
yet
strove
to
raise
the
body
nigel
went
to
her
assistance
but
not
without
a
glance
at
the
open
window
which
martha
as
acute
as
if
undisturbed
either
by
passion
or
terror
failed
not
to
interpret
justly
fear
not
she
cried
fear
not
they
are
base
cowards
to
whom
courage
is
as
much
unknown
as
mercy
if
i
had
had
weapons
i
could
have
defended
myself
against
them
without
assistance
or
oh
my
poor
father
protection
comes
too
late
for
this
cold
and
stiff
he
is
dead
dead
while
she
spoke
they
were
attempting
to
raise
the
dead
body
of
the
old
miser
but
it
was
evident
even
from
the
feeling
of
the
inactive
weight
and
rigid
joints
that
life
had
forsaken
her
station
nigel
looked
for
a
wound
but
saw
none
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
with
more
presence
of
mind
than
a
daughter
could
at
the
time
have
been
supposed
capable
of
exerting
discovered
the
instrument
of
his
murder
a
sort
of
scarf
which
had
been
drawn
so
tight
round
his
throat
as
to
stifle
his
cries
for
assistance
in
the
first
instance
and
afterwards
to
extinguish
life
she
undid
the
fatal
noose
and
laying
the
old
man
body
in
the
arms
of
lord
glenvarloch
she
ran
for
water
for
spirits
for
essences
in
the
vain
hope
that
life
might
be
only
suspended
that
hope
proved
indeed
vain
she
chafed
his
temples
raised
his
head
loosened
his
nightgown
for
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
arisen
from
bed
upon
hearing
the
entrance
of
the
villains
and
finally
opened
with
difficulty
his
fixed
and
hands
from
one
of
which
dropped
a
key
from
the
other
the
very
piece
of
gold
about
which
the
unhappy
man
had
been
a
little
before
so
anxious
and
which
probably
in
the
impaired
state
of
his
mental
faculties
he
was
disposed
to
defend
with
as
desperate
energy
as
if
its
amount
had
been
necessary
to
his
actual
existence
it
is
in
vain
it
is
in
vain
said
the
daughter
desisting
from
her
fruitless
attempts
to
recall
the
spirit
which
had
been
effectually
dislodged
for
the
neck
had
been
twisted
by
the
violence
of
the
murderers
it
is
in
vain
he
is
murdered
i
always
knew
it
would
be
thus
and
now
i
witness
it
she
then
snatched
up
the
key
and
the
piece
of
money
but
it
was
only
to
dash
them
again
on
the
floor
as
she
exclaimed
accursed
be
ye
both
for
you
are
the
causes
of
this
deed
nigel
would
have
spoken
would
have
reminded
her
that
measures
should
be
instantly
taken
for
the
pursuit
of
the
murderer
who
had
escaped
as
well
as
for
her
own
security
against
his
return
but
she
interrupted
him
sharply
be
silent
she
said
be
silent
think
you
the
thoughts
of
my
own
heart
are
not
enough
to
distract
me
and
with
such
a
sight
as
this
before
me
i
say
be
silent
she
said
again
and
in
a
yet
sterner
tone
can
a
daughter
listen
and
her
father
murdered
corpse
lying
on
her
knees
lord
glenvarloch
however
overpowered
by
the
energy
of
her
grief
felt
not
the
less
the
embarrassment
of
his
own
situation
he
had
discharged
both
his
pistols
the
robber
might
return
he
had
probably
other
assistants
besides
the
man
who
had
fallen
and
it
seemed
to
him
indeed
as
if
he
had
heard
a
muttering
beneath
the
windows
he
explained
hastily
to
his
companion
the
necessity
of
procuring
ammunition
you
are
right
she
said
somewhat
contemptuously
and
have
ventured
already
more
than
ever
i
expected
of
man
go
and
shift
for
yourself
since
that
is
your
purpose
leave
me
to
my
without
stopping
for
needless
expostulation
nigel
hastened
to
his
own
room
through
the
secret
passage
furnished
himself
with
the
ammunition
he
sought
for
and
returned
with
the
same
celerity
wondering
himself
at
the
accuracy
with
which
he
achieved
in
the
dark
all
the
meanderings
of
the
passage
which
he
had
traversed
only
once
and
that
in
a
moment
of
such
violent
agitation
he
found
on
his
return
the
unfortunate
woman
standing
like
a
statue
by
the
body
of
her
father
which
she
had
laid
straight
on
the
floor
having
covered
the
face
with
the
skirt
of
his
gown
she
testified
neither
surprise
nor
pleasure
at
nigel
return
but
said
to
him
calmly
my
moan
is
made
my
sorrow
all
the
sorrow
at
least
that
man
shall
ever
have
noting
of
is
gone
past
but
i
will
have
justice
and
the
base
villain
who
murdered
this
poor
defenceless
old
man
when
he
had
not
by
the
course
of
nature
a
twelvemonth
life
in
him
shall
not
cumber
the
earth
long
after
him
stranger
whom
heaven
has
sent
to
forward
the
revenge
reserved
for
this
action
go
to
hildebrod
there
they
are
awake
all
night
in
their
revels
bid
him
come
hither
he
is
bound
by
his
duty
and
dare
not
and
shall
not
refuse
his
assistance
which
he
knows
well
i
can
reward
why
do
ye
tarry
go
i
would
said
nigel
but
i
am
fearful
of
leaving
you
alone
the
villains
may
return
and
true
most
true
answered
martha
he
may
return
and
though
i
care
little
for
his
murdering
me
he
may
possess
himself
of
what
has
most
tempted
him
keep
this
key
and
this
piece
of
gold
they
are
both
of
importance
defend
your
life
if
assailed
and
if
you
kill
the
villain
i
will
make
you
rich
i
go
myself
to
call
for
nigel
would
have
remonstrated
with
her
but
she
had
departed
and
in
a
moment
he
heard
the
clank
behind
her
for
an
instant
he
thought
of
following
her
but
upon
recollection
that
the
distance
was
but
short
betwixt
the
tavern
of
hildebrod
and
the
house
of
trapbois
he
concluded
that
she
knew
it
better
than
he
incurred
little
danger
in
passing
it
and
that
he
would
do
well
in
the
meanwhile
to
remain
on
the
watch
as
she
recommended
it
was
no
pleasant
situation
for
one
unused
to
such
scenes
to
remain
in
the
apartment
with
two
dead
bodies
recently
those
of
living
and
breathing
men
who
had
both
within
the
space
of
less
than
half
an
hour
suffered
violent
death
one
of
them
by
the
hand
of
the
assassin
the
other
whose
blood
still
continued
to
flow
from
the
wound
in
his
throat
and
to
flood
all
around
him
by
the
spectator
own
deed
of
violence
though
of
justice
he
turned
his
face
from
those
wretched
relics
of
mortality
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
mingled
with
superstition
and
he
found
when
he
had
done
so
that
the
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
these
ghastly
objects
though
unseen
by
him
rendered
him
more
uncomfortable
than
even
when
he
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
and
reflected
by
the
cold
staring
lifeless
eyeballs
of
the
deceased
fancy
also
played
her
usual
sport
with
him
he
now
thought
he
heard
the
damask
nightgown
of
the
deceased
usurer
rustle
anon
that
he
heard
the
slaughtered
bravo
draw
up
his
leg
the
boot
scratching
the
floor
as
if
he
was
about
to
rise
and
again
he
deemed
he
heard
the
footsteps
and
the
whisper
of
the
returned
ruffian
under
the
window
from
which
he
had
lately
escaped
to
face
the
last
and
most
real
danger
and
to
parry
the
terrors
which
the
other
class
of
feelings
were
like
to
impress
upon
him
nigel
went
to
the
window
and
was
much
cheered
to
observe
the
light
of
several
torches
illuminating
the
street
and
followed
as
the
murmur
of
voices
denoted
by
a
number
of
persons
armed
it
would
seem
with
firelocks
and
halberds
and
attendant
on
hildebrod
who
not
in
his
fantastic
office
of
duke
but
in
that
which
he
really
possessed
of
bailiff
of
the
liberty
and
sanctuary
of
whitefriars
was
on
his
way
to
inquire
into
the
crime
and
its
circumstances
it
was
a
strange
and
melancholy
contrast
to
see
these
debauchees
disturbed
in
the
very
depth
of
their
midnight
revel
on
their
arrival
at
such
a
scene
as
this
they
stared
on
each
other
and
on
the
bloody
work
before
them
with
eyes
staggered
with
uncertain
steps
over
boards
slippery
with
blood
their
noisy
brawling
voices
sunk
into
stammering
whispers
and
with
spirits
quelled
by
what
they
saw
while
their
brains
were
still
stupefied
by
the
liquor
which
they
had
drunk
they
seemed
like
men
walking
in
their
sleep
old
hildebrod
was
an
exception
to
the
general
condition
that
seasoned
cask
however
full
was
at
all
times
capable
of
motion
when
there
occurred
a
motive
sufficiently
strong
to
set
him
he
seemed
much
shocked
at
what
he
beheld
and
his
proceedings
in
consequence
had
more
in
them
of
regularity
and
propriety
than
he
might
have
been
supposed
capable
of
exhibiting
upon
any
occasion
whatever
the
daughter
was
first
examined
and
stated
with
wonderful
accuracy
and
distinctness
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
alarmed
with
a
noise
of
struggling
and
violence
in
her
father
apartment
and
that
the
more
readily
because
she
was
watching
him
on
account
of
some
alarm
concerning
his
health
on
her
entrance
she
had
seen
her
father
sinking
under
the
strength
of
two
men
upon
whom
she
rushed
with
all
the
fury
she
was
capable
of
as
their
faces
were
blackened
and
their
figures
disguised
she
could
not
pretend
in
the
hurry
of
a
moment
so
dreadfully
agitating
to
distinguish
either
of
them
as
persons
whom
she
had
seen
before
she
remembered
little
more
except
the
firing
of
shots
until
she
found
herself
alone
with
her
guest
and
saw
that
the
ruffians
had
escaped
lord
glenvarloch
told
his
story
as
we
have
given
it
to
the
reader
the
direct
evidence
thus
received
hildebrod
examined
the
premises
he
found
that
the
villains
had
made
their
entrance
by
the
window
out
of
which
the
survivor
had
made
his
escape
yet
it
seemed
singular
that
they
should
have
done
so
as
it
was
secured
with
strong
iron
bars
which
old
trapbois
was
in
the
habit
of
shutting
with
his
own
hand
at
nightfall
he
minuted
down
with
great
accuracy
the
state
of
every
thing
in
the
apartment
and
examined
carefully
the
features
of
the
slain
robber
he
was
dressed
like
a
seaman
of
the
lowest
order
but
his
face
was
known
to
none
present
hildebrod
next
sent
for
an
alsatian
surgeon
whose
vices
undoing
what
his
skill
might
have
done
for
him
had
consigned
him
to
the
wretched
practice
of
this
place
he
made
him
examine
the
dead
bodies
and
make
a
proper
declaration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
sufferers
seemed
to
have
come
by
their
end
the
circumstances
of
the
sash
did
not
escape
the
learned
judge
and
having
listened
to
all
that
could
be
heard
or
conjectured
on
the
subject
and
collected
all
particulars
of
evidence
which
appeared
to
bear
on
the
bloody
transaction
he
commanded
the
door
of
the
apartment
to
be
locked
until
next
morning
and
carrying
the
unfortunate
daughter
of
the
murdered
man
into
the
kitchen
where
there
was
no
one
in
presence
but
lord
glenvarloch
he
asked
her
gravely
whether
she
suspected
no
one
in
particular
of
having
committed
the
deed
do
suspect
no
one
answered
martha
looking
fixedly
on
him
perhaps
i
may
mistress
but
it
is
my
part
to
ask
questions
yours
to
answer
them
that
the
rule
of
the
then
i
suspect
him
who
wore
yonder
sash
do
not
you
know
whom
i
mean
why
if
you
call
on
me
for
honours
i
must
needs
say
i
have
seen
captain
peppercull
have
one
of
such
a
fashion
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
change
his
suits
send
out
then
said
martha
and
have
him
if
it
is
he
he
will
be
far
by
this
time
but
i
will
communicate
with
the
higher
powers
answered
the
judge
you
would
have
him
escape
resumed
she
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
sternly
by
cock
and
pie
replied
hildebrod
did
it
depend
on
me
the
murdering
should
hang
as
high
as
ever
haman
did
but
let
me
take
my
time
he
has
friends
among
us
you
wot
well
and
all
that
should
assist
me
are
as
drunk
as
i
will
have
revenge
i
have
it
repeated
she
and
take
heed
you
trifle
not
with
trifle
i
would
sooner
trifle
with
a
the
minute
after
they
had
baited
her
i
tell
you
mistress
be
but
patient
and
we
will
have
him
i
know
all
his
haunts
and
he
can
not
forbear
them
long
and
i
will
have
open
for
him
you
can
not
want
justice
mistress
for
you
have
the
means
to
get
they
who
help
me
in
my
revenge
said
martha
shall
share
those
enough
said
replied
hildebrod
and
now
i
would
have
you
go
to
my
house
and
get
something
hot
you
will
be
but
dreary
here
by
i
will
send
for
the
old
replied
martha
and
we
have
the
stranger
gentleman
umph
umph
the
stranger
gentleman
said
hildebrod
to
nigel
whom
he
drew
a
little
apart
i
fancy
the
captain
has
made
the
stranger
gentleman
fortune
when
he
was
making
a
bold
dash
for
his
own
i
can
tell
your
honour
i
must
not
say
lordship
that
i
think
my
having
chanced
to
give
the
greasy
scoundrel

on
this
rough
game
the
better
for
you

will
get
the
cash
without
the
you
will
keep
conditions
i
trust
i
wish
you
had
said
nothing
to
any
one
of
a
scheme
so
absurd
said
nigel
absurd
why
think
you
she
will
not
have
thee
take
her
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
man
take
her
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
let
me
hear
from
you
a
nod
is
as
good
as
a
wink
i
must
to
my
business
of
sealing
and
locking
up
by
the
way
this
horrid
work
has
put
all
out
of
my
here
is
a
fellow
from
lowestoffe
has
been
asking
to
see
you
as
he
said
his
business
was
express
the
senate
only
made
him
drink
a
couple
of
flagons
and
he
was
just
coming
to
beat
up
your
quarters
when
this
breeze
blew
ahey
friend
there
is
master
nigel
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
green
plush
jerkin
with
a
badge
on
the
sleeve
and
having
the
appearance
of
a
waterman
approached
and
took
nigel
aside
while
duke
hildebrod
went
from
place
to
place
to
exercise
his
authority
and
to
see
the
windows
fastened
and
the
doors
of
the
apartment
locked
up
the
news
communicated
by
lowestoffe
messenger
were
not
the
most
pleasant
they
were
intimated
in
a
courteous
whisper
to
nigel
to
the
following
effect
that
master
lowestoffe
prayed
him
to
consult
his
safety
by
instantly
leaving
whitefriars
for
that
a
warrant
from
the
lord
had
been
issued
out
for
apprehending
him
and
would
be
put
in
force
by
the
assistance
of
a
party
of
musketeers
a
force
which
the
alsatians
neither
would
nor
dared
to
resist
and
so
squire
said
the
aquatic
emissary
my
wherry
is
to
wait
you
at
the
temple
stairs
yonder
at
five
this
morning
and
if
you
would
give
the
the
slip
why
you
why
did
not
master
lowestoffe
write
to
me
said
nigel
alas
the
good
gentleman
lies
up
in
lavender
for
it
himself
and
has
as
little
to
do
with
pen
and
ink
as
if
he
were
a
did
he
send
any
token
to
me
said
nigel
token
ay
marry
did
he
token
enough
an
i
have
not
forgot
it
said
the
fellow
then
giving
a
hoist
to
the
waistband
of
his
breeches
he
said
ay
i
have
it
you
were
to
believe
me
because
your
name
was
written
with
an
o
for
grahame
ay
that
was
it
i
well
shall
we
meet
in
two
hours
when
tide
turns
and
go
down
the
river
like
a
barge
where
is
the
king
just
now
knowest
thou
answered
lord
glenvarloch
the
king
why
he
went
down
to
greenwich
yesterday
by
water
like
a
noble
sovereign
as
he
is
who
will
always
float
where
he
can
he
was
to
have
hunted
this
week
but
that
purpose
is
broken
they
say
and
the
prince
and
the
duke
and
all
of
them
at
greenwich
are
as
merry
as
well
replied
nigel
i
will
be
ready
to
go
at
five
do
thou
come
hither
to
carry
my
ay
ay
master
replied
the
fellow
and
left
the
house
mixing
himself
with
the
disorderly
attendants
of
duke
hildebrod
who
were
now
retiring
that
potentate
entreated
nigel
to
make
fast
the
doors
behind
him
and
pointing
to
the
female
who
sat
by
the
expiring
fire
with
her
limbs
outstretched
like
one
whom
the
hand
of
death
had
already
arrested
he
whispered
mind
your
hits
and
mind
your
bargain
or
i
will
cut
your
for
you
before
you
can
draw
feeling
deeply
the
ineffable
brutality
which
could
recommend
the
prosecuting
such
views
over
a
wretch
in
such
a
condition
lord
glenvarloch
yet
commanded
his
temper
so
far
as
to
receive
the
advice
in
silence
and
attend
to
the
former
part
of
it
by
barring
the
door
carefully
behind
duke
hildebrod
and
his
suite
with
the
tacit
hope
that
he
should
never
again
see
or
hear
of
them
he
then
returned
to
the
kitchen
in
which
the
unhappy
woman
remained
her
hands
still
clenched
her
eyes
fixed
and
her
limbs
extended
like
those
of
a
person
in
a
trance
much
moved
by
her
situation
and
with
the
prospect
which
lay
before
her
he
endeavoured
to
awaken
her
to
existence
by
every
means
in
his
power
and
at
length
apparently
succeeded
in
dispelling
her
stupor
and
attracting
her
attention
he
then
explained
to
her
that
he
was
in
the
act
of
leaving
whitefriars
in
a
few
hours
that
his
future
destination
was
uncertain
but
that
he
desired
anxiously
to
know
whether
he
could
contribute
to
her
protection
by
apprizing
any
friend
of
her
situation
or
otherwise
with
some
difficulty
she
seemed
to
comprehend
his
meaning
and
thanked
him
with
her
usual
short
ungracious
manner
he
might
mean
well
she
said
but
he
ought
to
know
that
the
miserable
had
no
nigel
said
he
would
not
willingly
be
importunate
but
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
friars
she
interrupted
him
you
are
about
to
leave
the
friars
i
will
go
with
you
go
with
me
exclaimed
lord
glenvarloch
yes
she
said
i
will
persuade
my
father
to
leave
this
murdering
but
as
she
spoke
the
more
perfect
recollection
of
what
had
passed
crowded
on
her
mind
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
out
into
a
dreadful
fit
of
sobs
moans
and
lamentations
which
terminated
in
hysterics
violent
in
proportion
to
the
uncommon
strength
of
her
body
and
mind
lord
glenvarloch
shocked
confused
and
inexperienced
was
about
to
leave
the
house
in
quest
of
medical
or
at
least
female
assistance
but
the
patient
when
the
paroxysm
had
somewhat
spent
its
force
held
him
fast
by
the
sleeve
with
one
hand
covering
her
face
with
the
other
while
a
copious
flood
of
tears
came
to
relieve
the
emotions
of
grief
by
which
she
had
been
so
violently
agitated
do
not
leave
me
she
said
do
not
leave
me
and
call
no
one
i
have
never
been
in
this
way
before
and
would
not
now
she
said
sitting
upright
and
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
would
not
now
but
that
but
that
he
loved
if
he
loved
nothing
else
that
was
human
to
die
so
and
by
such
hands
and
again
the
unhappy
woman
gave
way
to
a
paroxysm
of
sorrow
mingling
her
tears
with
sobbing
wailing
and
all
the
abandonment
of
female
grief
when
at
its
utmost
height
at
length
she
gradually
recovered
the
austerity
of
her
natural
composure
and
maintained
it
as
if
by
a
forcible
exertion
of
resolution
repelling
as
she
spoke
the
repeated
returns
of
the
hysterical
affection
by
such
an
effort
as
that
by
which
epileptic
patients
are
known
to
suspend
the
recurrence
of
their
fits
yet
her
mind
however
resolved
could
not
so
absolutely
overcome
the
affection
of
her
nerves
but
that
she
was
agitated
by
strong
fits
of
trembling
which
for
a
minute
or
two
at
a
time
shook
her
whole
frame
in
a
manner
frightful
to
witness
nigel
forgot
his
own
situation
and
indeed
every
thing
else
in
the
interest
inspired
by
the
unhappy
woman
before
him
an
interest
which
affected
a
proud
spirit
the
more
deeply
that
she
herself
with
correspondent
highness
of
mind
seemed
determined
to
owe
as
little
as
possible
either
to
the
humanity
or
the
pity
of
others
i
am
not
wont
to
be
in
this
way
she
said
but
but
nature
will
have
power
over
the
frail
beings
it
has
made
over
you
sir
i
have
some
right
for
without
you
i
had
not
survived
this
awful
night
i
wish
your
aid
had
been
either
earlier
or
later
but
you
have
saved
my
life
and
you
are
bound
to
assist
in
making
it
endurable
to
if
you
will
show
me
how
it
is
possible
answered
nigel
you
are
going
hence
you
say
instantly
carry
me
with
you
said
the
unhappy
woman
by
my
own
efforts
i
shall
never
escape
from
this
wilderness
of
guilt
and
alas
what
can
i
do
for
you
replied
nigel
my
own
way
and
i
must
not
deviate
from
it
leads
me
in
all
probability
to
a
dungeon
i
might
indeed
transport
you
from
hence
with
me
if
you
could
afterwards
bestow
yourself
with
any
friend
she
exclaimed
i
have
no
friend
they
have
long
since
discarded
us
a
spectre
arising
from
the
dead
were
more
welcome
than
i
should
be
at
the
doors
of
those
who
have
disclaimed
us
and
if
they
were
willing
to
restore
their
friendship
to
me
now
i
would
despise
it
because
they
withdrew
it
from
him
from
him
here
she
underwent
strong
but
suppressed
agitation
and
then
added
firmly
from
who
lies
i
have
no
here
she
paused
and
then
suddenly
as
if
recollecting
herself
added
i
have
no
friend
but
i
have
that
will
purchase
many
i
have
that
which
will
purchase
both
friends
and
it
is
well
thought
of
i
must
not
leave
it
for
a
prey
to
cheats
and
stranger
you
must
return
to
yonder
room
pass
through
it
boldly
to
his
that
is
to
the
sleeping
apartment
push
the
bedstead
aside
beneath
each
of
the
posts
is
a
brass
plate
as
if
to
support
the
weight
but
it
is
that
upon
the
left
nearest
to
the
wall
which
must
serve
your
turn
press
the
corner
of
the
plate
and
it
will
spring
up
and
show
a
keyhole
which
this
key
will
open
you
will
then
lift
a
concealed
and
in
a
cavity
of
the
floor
you
will
discover
a
small
chest
bring
it
hither
it
shall
accompany
our
journey
and
it
will
be
hard
if
the
contents
can
not
purchase
me
a
place
of
but
the
door
communicating
with
the
kitchen
has
been
locked
by
these
people
said
nigel
true
i
had
forgot
they
had
their
reasons
for
that
doubtless
answered
she
but
the
secret
passage
from
your
apartment
is
open
and
you
may
go
that
lord
glenvarloch
took
the
key
and
as
he
lighted
a
lamp
to
show
him
the
way
she
read
in
his
countenance
some
unwillingness
to
the
task
imposed
you
fear
said
she
there
is
no
cause
the
murderer
and
his
victim
are
both
at
rest
take
courage
i
will
go
with
you
myself
you
can
not
know
the
trick
of
the
spring
and
the
chest
will
be
too
heavy
for
no
fear
no
fear
answered
lord
glenvarloch
ashamed
of
the
construction
she
put
upon
a
momentary
hesitation
arising
from
a
dislike
to
look
upon
what
is
horrible
often
connected
with
those
minds
which
are
the
last
to
fear
what
is
merely
dangerous
i
will
do
your
errand
as
you
desire
but
for
you
you
must
not
can
not
go
i
can
i
will
she
said
i
am
composed
you
shall
see
that
i
am
she
took
from
the
table
a
piece
of
unfinished
and
with
steadiness
and
composure
passed
a
silken
thread
into
the
eye
of
a
fine
could
i
have
done
that
she
said
with
a
smile
yet
more
ghastly
than
her
previous
look
of
fixed
despair
had
not
my
heart
and
hand
been
both
steady
she
then
led
the
way
rapidly
up
stairs
to
nigel
chamber
and
proceeded
through
the
secret
passage
with
the
same
haste
as
if
she
had
feared
her
resolution
might
have
failed
her
ere
her
purpose
was
executed
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
she
paused
a
moment
before
entering
the
fatal
apartment
then
hurried
through
with
a
rapid
step
to
the
sleeping
chamber
beyond
followed
closely
by
lord
glenvarloch
whose
reluctance
to
approach
the
scene
of
butchery
was
altogether
lost
in
the
anxiety
which
he
felt
on
account
of
the
survivor
of
the
tragedy
her
first
action
was
to
pull
aside
the
curtains
of
her
father
bed
the
were
thrown
aside
in
confusion
doubtless
in
the
action
of
his
starting
from
sleep
to
oppose
the
entrance
of
the
villains
into
the
next
apartment
the
hard
mattress
scarcely
showed
the
slight
pressure
where
the
emaciated
body
of
the
old
miser
had
been
deposited
his
daughter
sank
beside
the
bed
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
to
heaven
in
a
short
and
affectionate
manner
for
support
in
her
affliction
and
for
vengeance
on
the
villains
who
had
made
her
fatherless
a
and
still
more
brief
petition
recommended
to
heaven
the
soul
of
the
sufferer
and
invoked
pardon
for
his
sins
in
virtue
of
the
great
christian
atonement
this
duty
of
piety
performed
she
signed
to
nigel
to
aid
her
and
having
pushed
aside
the
heavy
bedstead
they
saw
the
brass
plate
which
martha
had
described
she
pressed
the
spring
and
at
once
the
plate
starting
up
showed
the
keyhole
and
a
large
iron
ring
used
in
lifting
the
which
when
raised
displayed
the
strong
box
or
small
chest
she
had
mentioned
and
which
proved
indeed
so
very
weighty
that
it
might
perhaps
have
been
scarcely
possible
for
nigel
though
a
very
strong
man
to
have
raised
it
without
assistance
having
replaced
everything
as
they
had
found
it
nigel
with
such
help
as
his
companion
was
able
to
afford
assumed
his
load
and
made
a
shift
to
carry
it
into
the
next
apartment
where
lay
the
miserable
owner
insensible
to
sounds
and
circumstances
which
if
any
thing
could
have
broken
his
long
last
slumber
would
certainly
have
done
so
his
unfortunate
daughter
went
up
to
his
body
and
had
even
the
courage
to
remove
the
sheet
which
had
been
decently
disposed
over
it
she
put
her
hand
on
the
heart
but
there
was
no
throb
held
a
feather
to
the
lips
but
there
was
no
motion
then
kissed
with
deep
reverence
the
starting
veins
of
the
pale
forehead
and
then
the
emaciated
hand
i
would
you
could
hear
me
she
said
father
i
would
you
could
hear
me
swear
that
if
i
now
save
what
you
most
valued
on
earth
it
is
only
to
assist
me
in
obtaining
vengeance
for
your
she
replaced
the
covering
and
without
a
tear
a
sigh
or
an
additional
word
of
any
kind
renewed
her
efforts
until
they
conveyed
the
betwixt
them
into
lord
glenvarloch
sleeping
apartment
it
must
pass
she
said
as
part
of
your
baggage
i
will
be
in
readiness
so
soon
as
the
waterman
she
retired
and
lord
glenvarloch
who
saw
the
hour
of
their
departure
approach
tore
down
a
part
of
the
old
hanging
to
make
a
covering
which
he
corded
upon
the
trunk
lest
the
peculiarity
of
its
shape
and
the
care
with
which
it
was
banded
and
counterbanded
with
bars
of
steel
might
afford
suspicions
respecting
the
treasure
which
it
contained
having
taken
this
measure
of
precaution
he
changed
the
rascally
disguise
which
he
had
assumed
on
entering
whitefriars
into
a
suit
becoming
his
quality
and
then
unable
to
sleep
though
exhausted
with
the
events
of
the
night
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
to
await
the
summons
of
the
waterman

a

at

of
the

announced
to

its
accompaniments
with
which
burden
he
began
to
trudge
towards
the
temple
stairs
his
comrade
who
seemed
the
principal
began
to
handle
the
trunk
which
contained
the
miser
treasure
but
pitched
it
down
again
in
an
instant
declaring
with
a
great
oath
that
it
was
as
reasonable
to
expect
a
man
to
carry
paul
on
his
back
the
daughter
of
trapbois
who
had
by
this
time
joined
them
muffled
up
in
a
long
dark
hood
and
mantle
exclaimed
to
lord
glenvarloch
let
them
leave
it
if
they
will
let
them
leave
it
all
let
us
but
escape
from
this
horrible
we
have
mentioned
elsewhere
that
nigel
was
a
very
athletic
young
man
and
impelled
by
a
strong
feeling
of
compassion
and
indignation
he
showed
his
bodily
strength
singularly
on
this
occasion
by
seizing
on
the
ponderous
and
by
means
of
the
rope
he
had
cast
around
it
throwing
it
on
his
shoulders
and
marching
resolutely
forward
under
a
weight
which
would
have
sunk
to
the
earth
three
young
gallants
at
the
least
of
our
degenerate
day
the
waterman
followed
him
in
amazement
calling
out
why
master
master
you
might
as
well
gie
me
end
o
and
anon
offered
his
assistance
to
support
it
in
some
degree
behind
which
after
the
first
minute
or
two
nigel
was
fain
to
accept
his
strength
was
almost
exhausted
when
he
reached
the
wherry
which
was
lying
at
the
temple
stairs
according
to
appointment
and
when
he
pitched
the
trunk
into
it
the
weight
sank
the
bow
of
the
boat
so
low
in
the
water
as
to
overset
it
we
shall
have
as
hard
a
fare
of
it
said
the
waterman
to
his
companion
as
if
we
were
ferrying
over
an
honest
bankrupt
with
all
his
secreted
goods
ho
ho
good
woman
what
are
you
stepping
in
for
our
gunwale
lies
deep
enough
in
the
water
without
live
lumber
to
this
person
comes
with
me
said
lord
glenvarloch
she
is
for
the
present
under
my
come
come
master
rejoined
the
fellow
that
is
out
of
my
commission
you
must
not
double
my
freight
on
me
she
may
go
by
land
and
as
for
protection
her
face
will
protect
her
from
berwick
to
the
land
you
will
not
except
at
my
doubling
the
loading
if
i
double
the
fare
said
nigel
determined
on
no
account
to
relinquish
the
protection
of
this
unhappy
woman
for
which
he
had
already
devised
some
sort
of
plan
likely
now
to
be
baffled
by
the
characteristic
rudeness
of
the
thames
watermen
ay
by
g
but
i
will
except
though
said
the
fellow
with
the
green
plush
jacket
i
will
overload
my
wherry
neither
for
love
nor
money
i
love
my
boat
as
well
as
my
wife
and
a
thought
nay
nay
comrade
said
his
mate
that
is
speaking
no
true
water
language
for
double
fare
we
are
bound
to
row
a
witch
in
her
eggshell
if
she
bid
us
and
so
pull
away
jack
and
let
us
have
no
more
they
got
into
the
accordingly
and
although
heavily
laden
began
to
move
down
the
river
with
reasonable
speed
the
lighter
vessels
which
passed
overtook
or
crossed
them
in
their
course
failed
not
to
assail
them
with
their
boisterous
raillery
which
was
then
called
for
which
the
extreme
plainness
of
mistress
martha
features
contrasted
with
the
youth
handsome
figure
and
good
looks
of
nigel
furnished
the
principal
topics
while
the
circumstance
of
the
boat
being
somewhat
overloaded
did
not
escape
their
notice
they
were
hailed
successively
as
a
grocer
wife
upon
a
party
of
pleasure
with
her
eldest
apprentice
as
an
old
woman
carrying
her
grandson
to
school
and
as
a
young
strapping
irishman
conveying
an
ancient
maiden
to
rigmarole
at
redriffe
who
buckles
beggars
for
a
tester
and
a
dram
of
geneva
all
this
abuse
was
retorted
in
a
similar
strain
of
humour
by
greenjacket
and
his
companion
who
maintained
the
war
of
wit
with
the
same
alacrity
with
which
they
were
assailed
meanwhile
lord
glenvarloch
asked
his
desolate
companion
if
she
had
thought
on
any
place
where
she
could
remain
in
safety
with
her
property
she
confessed
in
more
detail
than
formerly
that
her
father
character
had
left
her
no
friends
and
that
from
the
time
he
had
betaken
himself
to
whitefriars
to
escape
certain
legal
consequences
of
his
eager
pursuit
of
gain
she
had
lived
a
life
of
total
seclusion
not
associating
with
the
society
which
the
place
afforded
and
by
her
residence
there
as
well
as
her
father
parsimony
effectually
cut
off
from
all
other
company
what
she
now
wished
was
in
the
first
place
to
obtain
the
shelter
of
a
decent
lodging
and
the
countenance
of
honest
people
however
low
in
life
until
she
should
obtain
legal
advice
as
to
the
mode
of
obtaining
justice
on
her
father
murderer
she
had
no
hesitation
to
charge
the
guilt
upon
colepepper
commonly
called
peppercull
whom
she
knew
to
be
as
capable
of
any
act
of
treacherous
cruelty
as
he
was
cowardly
where
actual
manhood
was
required
he
had
been
strongly
suspected
of
two
robberies
before
one
of
which
was
coupled
with
an
atrocious
murder
he
had
she
intimated
made
pretensions
to
her
hand
as
the
easiest
and
safest
way
of
obtaining
possession
of
her
father
wealth
and
on
her
refusing
his
addresses
if
they
could
be
termed
so
in
the
most
positive
terms
he
had
thrown
out
such
obscure
hints
of
vengeance
as
joined
with
some
imperfect
assaults
upon
the
house
had
kept
her
in
frequent
alarm
both
on
her
father
account
and
her
own
nigel
but
that
his
feeling
of
respectful
delicacy
to
the
unfortunate
woman
forebade
him
to
do
so
could
here
have
communicated
a
circumstance
corroborative
of
her
suspicions
which
had
already
occurred
to
his
own
mind
he
recollected
the
hint
that
old
hildebrod
threw
forth
on
the
preceding
night
that
some
communication
betwixt
himself
and
colepepper
had
hastened
the
catastrophe
as
this
communication
related
to
the
plan
which
hildebrod
had
been
pleased
to
form
of
promoting
a
marriage
betwixt
nigel
himself
and
the
rich
heiress
of
trapbois
the
fear
of
losing
an
opportunity
not
to
be
regained
together
with
the
mean
malignity
of
a
ruffian
disappointed
in
a
favourite
scheme
was
most
likely
to
instigate
the
bravo
to
the
deed
of
violence
which
had
been
committed
the
reflection
that
his
own
name
was
in
some
degree
implicated
with
the
causes
of
this
horrid
tragedy
doubled
lord
glenvarloch
anxiety
in
behalf
of
the
victim
whom
he
had
rescued
while
at
the
same
time
he
formed
the
tacit
resolution
that
so
soon
as
his
own
affairs
were
put
upon
some
footing
he
would
contribute
all
in
his
power
towards
the
investigation
of
this
bloody
affair
after
ascertaining
from
his
companion
that
she
could
form
no
better
plan
of
her
own
he
recommended
to
her
to
take
up
her
lodging
for
the
time
at
the
house
of
his
old
landlord
christie
the
at
wharf
describing
the
decency
and
honesty
of
that
worthy
couple
and
expressing
his
hopes
that
they
would
receive
her
into
their
own
house
or
recommend
her
at
least
to
that
of
some
person
for
whom
they
would
be
responsible
until
she
should
have
time
to
enter
upon
other
arrangements
for
herself
the
poor
woman
received
advice
so
grateful
to
her
in
her
desolate
condition
with
an
expression
of
thanks
brief
indeed
but
deeper
than
any
thing
had
yet
extracted
from
the
austerity
of
her
natural
disposition
lord
glenvarloch
then
proceeded
to
inform
martha
that
certain
reasons
connected
with
his
personal
safety
called
him
immediately
to
greenwich
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
in
his
power
to
accompany
her
to
christie
house
which
he
would
otherwise
have
done
with
pleasure
but
tearing
a
leaf
from
his
tablet
he
wrote
on
it
a
few
lines
addressed
to
his
landlord
as
a
man
of
honesty
and
humanity
in
which
he
described
the
bearer
as
a
person
who
stood
in
singular
necessity
of
temporary
protection
and
good
advice
for
which
her
circumstances
enabled
her
to
make
ample
acknowledgment
he
therefore
requested
john
christie
as
his
old
and
good
friend
to
afford
her
the
shelter
of
his
roof
for
a
short
time
or
if
that
might
not
be
consistent
with
his
convenience
at
least
to
direct
her
to
a
proper
finally
he
imposed
on
him
the
additional
and
somewhat
more
difficult
commission
to
recommend
her
to
the
counsel
and
services
of
an
honest
at
least
a
reputable
and
skilful
attorney
for
the
transacting
some
law
business
of
importance
the
note
he
subscribed
with
his
real
name
and
delivering
it
to
his
who
received
it
with
another
deeply
uttered
i
thank
you
which
spoke
the
sterling
feelings
of
her
gratitude
better
than
a
thousand
combined
phrases
he
commanded
the
watermen
to
pull
in
for
paul
wharf
which
they
were
now
approaching
we
have
not
time
said
we
can
not
be
stopping
every
but
upon
nigel
insisting
upon
his
commands
being
obeyed
and
adding
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
putting
the
lady
ashore
the
waterman
declared
that
he
would
rather
have
her
room
than
her
company
and
put
the
wherry
alongside
the
wharf
accordingly
here
two
of
the
porters
who
ply
in
such
places
were
easily
induced
to
undertake
the
charge
of
the
ponderous
and
at
the
same
time
to
guide
the
owner
to
the
mansion
of
john
christie
with
whom
all
who
lived
in
that
neighbourhood
were
perfectly
acquainted
the
boat
much
lightened
of
its
load
went
down
the
thames
at
a
rate
increased
in
proportion
but
we
must
forbear
to
pursue
her
in
her
voyage
for
a
few
minutes
since
we
have
previously
to
mention
the
issue
of
lord
glenvarloch
recommendation
mistress
martha
trapbois
reached
the
shop
in
perfect
safety
and
was
about
to
enter
it
when
a
sickening
sense
of
the
uncertainty
of
her
situation
and
of
the
singularly
painful
task
of
telling
her
story
came
over
her
so
strongly
that
she
paused
a
moment
at
the
very
threshold
of
her
proposed
place
of
refuge
to
think
in
what
manner
she
could
best
second
the
recommendation
of
the
friend
whom
providence
had
raised
up
to
her
had
she
possessed
that
knowledge
of
the
world
from
which
her
habits
of
life
had
completely
excluded
her
she
might
have
known
that
the
large
sum
of
money
which
she
brought
along
with
her
might
judiciously
managed
have
been
a
passport
to
her
into
the
mansions
of
nobles
and
the
palaces
of
princes
but
however
conscious
of
its
general
power
which
assumes
so
many
forms
and
complexions
she
was
so
inexperienced
as
to
be
most
unnecessarily
afraid
that
the
means
by
which
the
wealth
had
been
acquired
might
exclude
its
inheretrix
from
shelter
even
in
the
house
of
a
humble
tradesman
while
she
thus
delayed
a
more
reasonable
cause
for
hesitation
arose
in
a
considerable
noise
and
altercation
within
the
house
which
grew
louder
and
louder
as
the
disputants
issued
forth
upon
the
street
or
lane
before
the
door
the
first
who
entered
upon
the
scene
was
a
tall
man
who
stalked
out
of
the
shop
hastily
with
a
gait
like
that
of
a
spaniard
in
a
passion
who
disdaining
to
add
speed
to
his
locomotion
by
running
only
condescends
in
the
utmost
extremity
of
his
angry
haste
to
add
length
to
his
stride
he
faced
about
so
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
house
upon
his
pursuer
a
elderly
plain
tradesman
no
other
than
john
christie
himself
the
owner
of
the
shop
and
tenement
by
whom
he
seemed
to
be
followed
and
who
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
more
than
is
usually
expressed
by
such
a
person
i
hear
no
more
o
said
the
personage
who
first
appeared
on
the
sir
i
will
hear
no
more
on
it
besides
being
a
most
false
and
impudent
figment
as
i
can
testify
it
is
sir
he
reiterated
with
a
broad
accentuation
of
the
first
vowel
well
known
in
the
colleges
of
edinburgh
and
glasgow
which
we
can
only
express
in
print
by
doubling
the
said
first
of
letters
and
of
vowels
and
which
would
have
cheered
the
cockles
of
the
reigning
monarch
had
he
been
within
hearing
as
he
was
a
severer
stickler
for
what
he
deemed
the
genuine
pronunciation
of
the
roman
tongue
than
for
any
of
the
royal
prerogatives
for
which
he
was
at
times
disposed
to
insist
so
strenuously
in
his
speeches
to
parliament
i
care
not
an
ounce
of
rotten
cheese
said
john
christie
in
reply
what
you
call
it
but
it
is
true
and
i
am
a
free
englishman
and
have
right
to
speak
the
truth
in
my
own
concerns
and
your
master
is
little
better
than
a
villain
and
you
no
more
than
a
swaggering
coxcomb
whose
head
i
will
presently
break
as
i
have
known
it
well
broken
before
on
lighter
and
so
saying
he
flourished
the
which
usually
made
clean
the
steps
of
his
little
shop
and
which
he
had
caught
up
as
the
readiest
weapon
of
working
his
foeman
damage
and
advanced
therewith
upon
him
the
cautious
scot
for
such
our
readers
must
have
already
pronounced
him
from
his
language
and
pedantry
drew
back
as
the
enraged
approached
but
in
a
surly
manner
and
bearing
his
hand
on
his
rather
in
the
act
of
one
who
was
losing
habitual
forbearance
and
caution
of
deportment
than
as
alarmed
by
the
attack
of
an
antagonist
inferior
to
himself
in
youth
strength
and
weapons
bide
back
he
said
maister
christie
i
say
bide
back
and
consult
your
safety
man
i
have
evited
striking
you
in
your
ain
house
under
muckle
provocation
because
i
am
ignorant
how
the
laws
here
may
pronounce
respecting
burglary
and
hamesucken
and
such
matters
and
besides
i
would
not
willingly
hurt
ye
man
on
the
causeway
that
is
free
to
us
baith
because
i
mind
your
kindness
of
lang
syne
and
partly
consider
ye
as
a
poor
deceived
creature
but
deil
d
n
me
sir
and
i
am
not
wont
to
swear
but
if
you
touch
my
scotch
shouther
with
that
shule
of
yours
i
will
make
six
inches
of
my
andrew
ferrara
deevilish
intimate
with
your
guts
and
therewithal
though
still
retreating
from
the
brandished
shovel
he
made
of
the
broadsword
which
he
wore
visible
from
the
sheath
the
wrath
of
john
christie
was
abated
either
by
his
natural
temperance
of
disposition
or
perhaps
in
part
by
the
glimmer
of
cold
steel
which
flashed
on
him
from
his
adversary
last
action
i
would
do
well
to
cry
clubs
on
thee
and
have
thee
ducked
at
the
wharf
he
said
grounding
his
shovel
however
at
the
same
time
for
a
paltry
swaggerer
that
would
draw
thy
bit
of
iron
there
on
an
honest
citizen
before
his
own
door
but
get
thee
gone
and
reckon
on
a
salt
eel
for
thy
supper
if
thou
shouldst
ever
come
near
my
house
again
i
wish
it
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
thames
when
it
first
gave
the
use
of
its
roof
to
scots
thieves
it
an
ill
bird
that
fouls
its
own
nest
replied
his
adversary
not
perhaps
the
less
bold
that
he
saw
matters
were
taking
the
turn
of
a
pacific
debate
and
a
pity
it
is
that
a
kindly
scot
should
ever
have
married
in
foreign
parts
and
given
life
to
a
southron
such
as
you
maister
christie
but
fare
ye
weel
fare
ye
weel
for
ever
and
a
day
and
if
you
quarrel
wi
a
scot
again
man
say
as
mickle
ill
o
himsell
as
ye
like
but
say
nane
of
his
patron
or
of
his
countrymen
or
it
will
scarce
be
your
flat
cap
that
will
keep
your
lang
lugs
from
the
sharp
abridgement
of
a
highland
whinger
and
if
you
continue
your
insolence
to
me
before
my
own
door
were
it
but
two
minutes
longer
retorted
john
christie
i
will
call
the
constable
and
make
your
scottish
ankles
acquainted
with
an
english
pair
of
stocks
so
saying
he
turned
to
retire
into
his
shop
with
some
show
of
victory
for
his
enemy
whatever
might
be
his
innate
valour
manifested
no
desire
to
drive
matters
to
extremity
conscious
perhaps
that
whatever
advantage
he
might
gain
in
single
combat
with
jonn
christie
would
be
more
than
overbalanced
by
incurring
an
affair
with
the
constituted
authorities
of
old
england
not
at
that
time
apt
to
be
particularly
favourable
to
their
new
in
the
various
successive
broils
which
were
then
constantly
taking
place
between
the
individuals
of
two
proud
nations
who
still
retained
a
stronger
sense
of
their
national
animosity
during
centuries
than
of
their
late
union
for
a
few
years
under
the
government
of
the
same
prince
martha
trapbois
had
dwelt
too
long
in
alsatia
to
be
either
surprised
or
terrified
at
the
altercation
she
had
witnessed
indeed
she
only
wondered
that
the
debate
did
not
end
in
some
of
those
acts
of
violence
by
which
they
were
usually
terminated
in
the
sanctuary
as
the
disputants
separated
from
each
other
she
who
had
no
idea
that
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
was
more
deeply
rooted
than
in
the
daily
scenes
of
the
same
nature
which
she
had
heard
of
or
witnessed
did
not
hesitate
to
stop
master
christie
in
his
return
to
his
shop
and
present
to
him
the
letter
which
lord
glenvarloch
had
given
to
her
had
she
been
better
acquainted
with
life
and
its
business
she
would
certainly
have
waited
for
a
more
temperate
moment
and
she
had
reason
to
repent
of
her
precipitation
when
without
saying
a
single
word
or
taking
the
trouble
to
gather
more
of
the
information
contained
in
the
letter
than
was
expressed
in
the
subscription
the
incensed
ship
chandler
threw
it
down
on
the
ground
trampled
it
in
high
disdain
and
without
addressing
a
single
word
to
the
bearer
except
indeed
something
much
more
like
a
hearty
curse
than
was
perfectly
consistent
with
his
own
grave
appearance
he
retired
into
his
shop
and
shut
the
it
was
with
the
most
inexpressible
anguish
that
the
desolate
friendless
and
unhappy
female
thus
beheld
her
sole
hope
of
succour
countenance
and
protection
vanish
at
once
without
being
able
to
conceive
a
reason
for
to
do
her
justice
the
idea
that
her
friend
whom
she
knew
by
the
name
of
nigel
grahame
had
imposed
on
her
a
solution
which
might
readily
have
occurred
to
many
in
her
situation
never
once
entered
her
mind
although
it
was
not
her
temper
easily
to
bend
her
mind
to
entreaty
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
after
the
ireful
and
retreating
good
master
hear
me
but
a
moment
for
mercy
sake
for
honesty
sake
mercy
and
honesty
from
him
mistress
said
the
scot
who
though
he
essayed
not
to
interrupt
the
retreat
of
his
antagonist
still
kept
stout
possession
of
the
field
of
action
ye
might
as
weel
expect
brandy
from
or
milk
from
a
craig
of
blue
whunstane
the
man
is
mad
bom
mad
to
i
must
have
mistaken
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
was
addressed
then
and
as
she
spoke
mistress
martha
trapbois
was
in
the
act
of
stooping
to
lift
the
paper
which
had
been
so
uncourteously
received
her
companion
with
natural
civility
anticipated
her
purpose
but
what
was
not
quite
so
much
in
etiquette
he
took
a
sly
glance
at
it
as
he
was
about
to
hand
it
to
her
and
his
eye
having
caught
the
subscription
he
said
with
surprise
glenvarloch
nigel
olifaunt
of
glenvarloch
do
you
know
the
lord
glenvarloch
mistress
i
know
not
of
whom
you
speak
said
martha
peevishly
i
had
that
paper
from
one
master
nigel
nigel
grahame
ay
very
true
i
had
forgot
said
the
scotsman
a
tall
young
man
about
my
height
bright
blue
eyes
like
a
hawk
a
pleasant
speech
something
leaning
to
the
kindly
accentuation
but
not
much
in
respect
of
his
having
been
resident
abroad
all
this
is
true
and
what
of
it
all
said
the
daughter
of
the
miser
hair
of
my
complexion
yours
is
red
replied
she
i
pray
you
peace
said
the
scotsman
i
was
going
to
say
of
my
complexion
but
with
a
deeper
shade
of
the
chestnut
weel
mistress
if
i
have
guessed
the
man
aright
he
is
one
with
whom
i
am
and
have
been
intimate
and
familiar
nay
i
may
truly
say
i
have
done
him
much
service
in
my
time
and
may
live
to
do
him
more
i
had
indeed
a
sincere
for
him
and
i
doubt
he
has
been
much
at
a
loss
since
we
parted
but
the
fault
is
not
mine
wherefore
as
this
letter
will
not
avail
you
with
him
to
whom
it
is
directed
you
may
believe
that
heaven
hath
sent
it
to
me
who
have
a
special
regard
for
the
writer
i
have
besides
as
much
mercy
and
honesty
within
me
as
man
can
weel
make
his
bread
with
and
am
willing
to
aid
any
distressed
creature
that
is
my
friend
friend
with
my
counsel
and
otherwise
so
that
i
am
not
put
to
much
charges
being
in
a
strange
country
like
a
poor
lamb
that
has
wandered
from
its
ain
native
hirsel
and
leaves
a
tait
of
its
woo
in
every
d
d
southron
bramble
that
comes
across
while
he
spoke
thus
he
read
the
contents
of
the
letter
without
waiting
for
permission
and
then
continued
and
so
this
is
all
that
you
are
wanting
my
dove
nothing
more
than
safe
and
honourable
lodging
and
sustenance
upon
your
own
charges
nothing
more
said
she
if
you
are
a
man
and
a
christian
you
will
help
me
to
what
i
need
so
a
man
i
am
replied
the
formal
caledonian
sic
as
ye
see
me
and
a
christian
i
may
call
myself
though
unworthy
and
though
i
have
heard
little
pure
doctrine
since
i
came
hither
a
polluted
with
devices
ahem
weel
and
if
ye
be
an
honest
woman
here
he
peeped
under
her
muffler
as
an
honest
woman
ye
seem
likely
to
be
though
let
me
tell
you
they
are
a
kind
of
cattle
not
so
rife
in
the
streets
of
this
city
as
i
would
desire
them
i
was
almost
strangled
with
my
own
band
by
twa
rampallians
wha
wanted
yestreen
nae
farther
gane
to
harle
me
into
a
however
if
ye
be
a
decent
honest
woman
here
he
took
another
peep
at
features
certainly
bearing
no
beauty
which
could
infer
suspicion
as
decent
and
honest
ye
seem
to
be
why
i
will
advise
you
to
a
decent
house
where
you
will
get
douce
quiet
entertainment
on
reasonable
terms
and
the
occasional
benefit
of
my
own
counsel
and
direction
that
is
from
time
to
time
as
my
other
avocations
may
may
i
venture
to
accept
of
such
an
offer
from
a
stranger
said
martha
with
natural
hesitation
troth
i
see
nothing
to
hinder
you
mistress
replied
the
bonny
scot
ye
can
but
see
the
place
and
do
after
as
ye
think
best
besides
we
are
nae
such
strangers
neither
for
i
know
your
friend
and
you
it
like
know
mine
whilk
knowledge
on
either
hand
is
a
medium
of
communication
between
us
even
as
the
middle
of
the
string
connecteth
its
twa
ends
or
extremities
but
i
will
enlarge
on
this
farther
as
we
pass
along
gin
ye
list
to
bid
your
twa
lazy
loons
of
porters
there
lift
up
your
little
kist
between
them
whilk
ae
true
scotsman
might
carry
under
his
arm
let
me
tell
you
mistress
ye
will
soon
make
a
toom
of
it
in
if
you
hire
twa
knaves
to
do
the
work
of
so
saying
he
led
the
way
followed
by
mistress
martha
trapbois
whose
singular
destiny
though
it
had
heaped
her
with
wealth
had
left
her
for
the
moment
no
wiser
counsellor
or
more
distinguished
protector
than
honest
richie
moniplies
a
discarded
chapter
xxvii
this
way
lie
safety
and
a
sure
retreat
yonder
lie
danger
shame
and
punishment
most
welcome
danger
then
nay
let
me
say
though
spoke
with
swelling
heart
welcome
shame
and
welcome
punishment
for
call
me
guilty
i
do
but
pay
the
tax
that
due
to
justice
and
call
me
guiltless
then
that
punishment
is
shame
to
those
alone
who
do
inflict
it
we
left
lord
glenvarloch
to
whose
fortunes
our
story
chiefly
attaches
itself
gliding
swiftly
down
the
thames
he
was
not
as
the
reader
may
have
observed
very
affable
in
his
disposition
or
apt
to
enter
into
conversation
with
those
into
whose
company
he
was
casually
thrown
this
was
indeed
an
error
in
his
conduct
arising
less
from
pride
though
of
that
feeling
we
do
not
pretend
to
exculpate
him
than
from
a
sort
of
bashful
reluctance
to
mix
in
the
conversation
of
those
with
whom
he
was
not
familiar
it
is
a
fault
only
to
be
cured
by
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
world
which
soon
teaches
every
sensible
and
acute
person
the
important
lesson
that
amusement
and
what
is
of
more
consequence
that
information
and
increase
of
knowledge
are
to
be
derived
from
the
conversation
of
every
individual
whatever
with
whom
he
is
thrown
into
a
natural
train
of
communication
for
ourselves
we
can
assure
the
reader
and
perhaps
if
we
have
ever
been
able
to
afford
him
amusement
it
is
owing
in
a
great
degree
to
this
cause
that
we
never
found
ourselves
in
company
with
the
stupidest
of
all
possible
companions
in
a
or
with
the
most
arrant
that
ever
occupied
a
place
in
the
without
finding
that
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
with
him
we
had
some
ideas
suggested
to
us
either
grave
orgay
or
some
information
communicated
in
the
course
of
our
journey
which
we
should
have
regretted
not
to
have
learned
and
which
we
should
be
sorry
to
have
immediately
forgotten
but
nigel
was
somewhat
immured
within
the
bastile
of
his
rank
as
some
philosopher
tom
paine
we
think
has
happily
enough
expressed
that
sort
of
shyness
which
men
of
dignified
situations
are
apt
to
be
beset
with
rather
from
not
exactly
knowing
how
far
or
with
whom
they
ought
to
be
familiar
than
from
any
real
touch
of
aristocratic
pride
besides
the
immediate
pressure
of
our
adventurer
own
affairs
was
such
as
exclusively
to
engross
his
attention
he
sat
therefore
wrapt
in
his
cloak
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
with
his
mind
entirely
bent
upon
the
probable
issue
of
the
interview
with
his
sovereign
which
it
was
his
purpose
to
seek
for
which
abstraction
of
mind
he
may
be
fully
justified
although
perhaps
by
questioning
the
watermen
who
were
transporting
him
down
the
river
he
might
have
discovered
matters
of
high
concernment
to
him
at
any
rate
nigel
remained
silent
till
the
wherry
approached
the
town
of
greenwich
when
he
commanded
the
men
to
put
in
for
the
nearest
as
it
was
his
purpose
to
go
ashore
there
and
dismiss
them
from
further
attendance
that
is
not
possible
said
the
fellow
with
the
green
jacket
who
as
we
have
already
said
seemed
to
take
on
himself
the
charge
of
pilotage
we
must
go
he
continued
to
gravesend
where
a
scottish
vessel
which
dropped
down
the
river
last
tide
for
the
very
purpose
lies
with
her
anchor
waiting
to
carry
you
to
your
own
dear
northern
country
your
hammock
is
slung
and
all
is
ready
for
you
and
you
talk
of
going
ashore
at
greenwich
as
seriously
as
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
i
see
no
impossibility
said
nigel
in
your
landing
me
where
i
desire
to
be
landed
but
very
little
possibility
of
your
carrying
me
anywhere
i
am
not
desirous
of
why
whether
do
you
manage
the
wherry
or
we
master
asked
in
a
tone
betwixt
jest
and
earnest
i
take
it
she
will
go
the
way
we
row
ay
retorted
nigel
but
i
take
it
you
will
row
her
on
the
course
i
direct
you
otherwise
your
chance
of
payment
is
but
a
poor
suppose
we
are
content
to
risk
that
said
the
undaunted
waterman
i
wish
to
know
how
you
who
talk
so
big
i
mean
no
offence
master
but
you
do
talk
big
would
help
yourself
in
such
a
case
simply
thus
answered
lord
glenvarloch
you
saw
me
an
hour
since
bring
down
to
the
boat
a
trunk
that
neither
of
you
could
lift
if
we
are
to
contest
the
destination
of
our
voyage
the
same
strength
which
tossed
that
chest
into
the
wherry
will
suffice
to
fling
you
out
of
it
wherefore
before
we
begin
the
scuffle
i
pray
you
to
remember
that
whither
i
would
go
there
i
will
oblige
you
to
carry
gramercy
for
your
kindness
said
and
now
mark
me
in
return
my
comrade
and
i
are
two
men
and
you
were
you
as
stout
as
can
pass
but
for
one
and
two
you
will
allow
are
more
than
a
match
for
one
you
mistake
in
your
reckoning
my
it
is
you
who
mistake
answered
nigel
who
began
to
grow
warm
it
is
i
who
am
three
to
two
sirrah
i
carry
two
men
lives
at
my
so
saying
he
opened
his
cloak
and
showed
the
two
pistols
which
he
had
disposed
at
his
girdle
was
unmoved
at
the
display
i
have
got
said
he
a
pair
of
barkers
that
will
match
yours
and
he
showed
that
he
also
was
armed
with
pistols
so
you
may
begin
as
soon
as
you
then
said
lord
glenvarloch
drawing
forth
and
cocking
a
pistol
the
sooner
the
better
take
notice
i
hold
you
as
a
ruffian
who
have
declared
you
will
put
force
on
my
person
and
that
i
will
shoot
you
through
the
head
if
you
do
not
instantly
put
me
ashore
at
the
other
waterman
alarmed
at
nigel
gesture
lay
upon
his
oar
but
replied
coolly
look
you
master
i
should
not
care
a
tester
to
venture
a
life
with
you
on
this
matter
but
the
truth
is
i
am
employed
to
do
you
good
and
not
to
do
you
by
whom
are
you
employed
said
the
lord
glenvarloch
or
who
dare
concern
themselves
in
me
or
my
affairs
without
my
authority
as
to
that
answered
the
waterman
in
the
same
tone
of
indifference
i
shall
not
show
my
commission
for
myself
i
care
not
as
i
said
whether
you
land
at
greenwich
to
get
yourself
hanged
or
go
down
to
get
aboard
the
royal
thistle
to
make
your
escape
to
your
own
country
you
will
be
equally
out
of
my
reach
either
way
but
it
is
fair
to
put
the
choice
before
my
choice
is
made
said
nigel
i
have
told
you
thrice
already
it
is
my
pleasure
to
be
landed
at
write
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
said
the
waterman
that
such
is
your
positive
will
i
must
have
something
to
show
to
my
employers
that
the
transgression
of
their
orders
lies
with
yourself
not
with
i
choose
to
hold
this
trinket
in
my
hand
for
the
present
said
nigel
showing
his
pistol
and
will
write
you
the
acquittance
when
i
go
i
would
not
go
ashore
with
you
for
a
hundred
pieces
said
the
waterman
ill
luck
has
ever
attended
you
except
in
small
gaming
do
me
fair
justice
and
give
me
the
testimony
i
desire
if
you
are
afraid
of
foul
play
while
you
write
it
you
may
hold
my
pistols
if
you
he
offered
the
weapons
to
nigel
accordingly
who
while
they
were
under
his
control
and
all
possibility
of
his
being
taken
at
disadvantage
was
excluded
no
longer
hesitated
to
give
the
waterman
an
acknowledgment
in
the
following
terms
jack
in
the
green
with
his
mate
belonging
to
the
wherry
called
the
jolly
raven
have
done
their
duty
faithfully
by
me
landing
me
at
greenwich
by
my
express
command
and
being
themselves
willing
and
desirous
to
carry
me
on
board
the
royal
thistle
presently
lying
at
having
finished
this
acknowledgment
which
he
signed
with
the
letters
as
indicating
his
name
and
title
he
again
requested
to
know
of
the
waterman
to
whom
he
delivered
it
the
name
of
his
employers
sir
replied
jack
in
the
green
i
have
respected
your
secret
do
not
you
seek
to
pry
into
mine
it
would
do
you
no
good
to
know
for
whom
i
am
taking
this
present
trouble
and
to
be
brief
you
shall
not
know
it
and
if
you
will
fight
in
the
quarrel
as
you
said
even
now
the
sooner
we
begin
the
better
only
this
you
may
be
of
that
we
designed
you
no
harm
and
that
if
you
fall
into
any
it
will
be
of
your
own
wilful
as
he
spoke
they
approached
the
where
nigel
instantly
jumped
ashore
the
waterman
placed
his
small
on
the
stairs
observing
that
there
were
plenty
of
spare
hands
about
to
carry
it
where
he
would
we
part
friends
i
hope
my
lads
said
the
young
nobleman
offering
at
the
same
time
a
piece
of
money
more
than
double
the
usual
fare
to
the
boatmen
we
part
as
we
met
answered
and
for
your
money
i
am
paid
sufficiently
with
this
bit
of
paper
only
if
you
owe
me
any
love
for
the
cast
i
have
given
you
i
pray
you
not
to
dive
so
deep
into
the
pockets
of
the
next
apprentice
that
you
find
fool
enough
to
play
the
and
you
you
greedy
swine
said
he
to
his
companion
who
still
had
a
longing
eye
fixed
on
the
money
which
nigel
continued
to
offer
push
off
or
if
i
take
a
stretcher
in
hand
i
break
the
knave
pate
of
the
fellow
pushed
off
as
he
was
commanded
but
still
could
not
help
muttering
this
was
entirely
out
of
glenvarloch
though
without
the
devotion
of
the
injured
thales
of
the
moralist
to
the
memory
of
that
great
princess
had
now
attained
the
hallow
soil
which
gave
eliza
birth
whose
halls
were
now
less
respectably
occupied
by
her
successor
it
was
not
as
has
been
well
shown
by
a
late
author
that
james
was
void
either
of
parts
or
of
good
intentions
and
his
predecessor
was
at
least
as
arbitrary
in
effect
as
he
was
in
theory
but
while
elizabeth
possessed
a
sternness
of
masculine
sense
and
determination
which
rendered
even
her
weaknesses
some
of
which
were
in
themselves
sufficiently
ridiculous
in
a
certain
degree
respectable
james
on
the
other
hand
was
so
utterly
devoid
of
firm
resolve
so
well
called
by
the
scottish
bard
the
stalk
of
in
man
that
even
his
virtues
and
his
good
meaning
became
laughable
from
the
whimsical
uncertainty
of
his
conduct
so
that
the
wisest
things
he
ever
said
and
the
best
actions
he
ever
did
were
often
touched
with
a
strain
of
the
ludicrous
and
fidgety
character
of
the
man
accordingly
though
at
different
periods
of
his
reign
he
contrived
to
acquire
with
his
people
a
certain
degree
of
temporary
popularity
it
never
long
outlived
the
occasion
which
produced
it
so
true
it
is
that
the
mass
of
mankind
will
respect
a
monarch
stained
with
actual
guilt
more
than
one
whose
foibles
render
him
only
ridiculous
to
return
from
this
digression
lord
glenvarloch
soon
received
as
had
assured
him
the
offer
of
an
idle
bargeman
to
transport
his
baggage
where
he
listed
but
that
where
was
a
question
of
momentary
doubt
at
length
recollecting
the
necessity
that
his
hair
and
beard
should
be
properly
arranged
before
he
attempted
to
enter
the
royal
presence
and
desirous
at
the
same
time
of
obtaining
some
information
of
the
motions
of
the
sovereign
and
of
the
court
he
desired
to
be
guided
to
the
next
barber
shop
which
we
have
already
mentioned
as
the
place
where
news
of
every
kind
circled
and
centred
he
was
speedily
shown
the
way
to
such
an
emporium
of
intelligence
and
soon
found
he
was
likely
to
hear
all
he
desired
to
know
and
much
more
while
his
head
was
subjected
to
the
art
of
a
nimble
tonsor
the
glibness
of
whose
tongue
kept
pace
with
the
nimbleness
of
his
fingers
while
he
ran
on
without
stint
or
stop
in
the
following
excursive
manner
the
court
here
master
yes
master
much
to
the
advantage
of
trade
good
custom
stirring
his
majesty
loves
greenwich
hunts
every
morning
in
the
park
all
decent
persons
admitted
that
have
the
entries
of
the
palace
no
rabble
frightened
the
king
horse
with
their
hallooing
the
uncombed
yes
sir
the
beard
more
peaked
yes
master
so
it
is
worn
i
know
the
last
cut
dress
several
of
the
courtiers
one
two
pages
of
the
body
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
three
running
footmen
two
and
an
honourable
scottish
knight
sir
munko
malagrowther
i
suppose
said
nigel
thrusting
in
his
conjectural
emendation
with
infinite
difficulty
betwixt
two
clauses
of
the
barber
text
yes
sir
malcrowder
sir
as
you
say
sir
hard
names
the
scots
have
sir
for
an
english
mouth
sir
munko
is
a
handsome
person
sir
perhaps
you
know
him
bating
the
loss
of
his
fingers
and
the
lameness
of
his
leg
and
the
length
of
his
chin
sir
it
takes
me
one
minute
twelve
seconds
more
time
to
trim
that
chin
of
his
than
any
chin
that
i
know
in
the
town
of
greenwich
sir
but
he
is
a
very
comely
gentleman
for
all
that
and
a
pleasant
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
sir
and
a
saving
that
he
is
so
deaf
he
can
never
hear
good
of
any
one
and
so
wise
that
he
can
never
believe
it
but
he
is
a
very
gentleman
for
all
that
except
when
one
speaks
too
low
or
when
a
hair
turns
did
i
graze
you
sir
we
shall
put
it
to
rights
in
a
moment
with
one
drop
of
styptic
my
styptic
or
rather
my
wife
sir
she
makes
the
water
herself
one
drop
of
the
styptic
sir
and
a
bit
of
black
taffeta
patch
just
big
enough
to
be
the
saddle
to
a
flea
sir
yes
sir
rather
improves
than
otherwise
the
prince
had
a
patch
the
other
day
and
so
had
the
duke
and
if
you
will
believe
me
there
are
seventeen
yards
three
quarters
of
black
taffeta
already
cut
into
patches
for
the
but
sir
mungo
malagrowther
again
interjected
nigel
with
difficulty
ay
ay
sir
sir
munko
as
you
say
a
pleasant
gentleman
as
ever
to
be
spoken
with
did
you
say
o
ay
easily
to
be
spoken
withal
that
is
as
easily
as
his
infirmity
will
permit
he
will
presently
unless
some
one
hath
asked
him
forth
to
breakfast
be
taking
his
bone
of
broiled
beef
at
my
neighbour
ned
kilderkin
yonder
removed
from
over
the
way
ned
keeps
an
sir
famous
for
but
sir
munko
can
not
abide
pork
no
more
than
the
king
most
sacred
majesty
footnote
the
scots
till
within
the
last
generation
disliked
swine
flesh
as
an
article
of
food
as
much
as
the
highlanders
do
at
present
it
was
remarked
as
extraordinary
rapacity
when
the
border
depredators
condescended
to
make
prey
of
the
accursed
race
whom
the
fiend
made
his
habitation
ben
jonson
in
drawing
character
says
he
loved
no
part
of
a
nor
my
lord
duke
of
lennox
nor
lord
dalgarno
nay
i
am
sure
sir
if
i
touched
you
this
time
it
was
your
fault
not
but
a
single
drop
of
the
styptic
another
little
patch
that
would
make
a
doublet
for
a
flea
just
under
the
left
moustache
it
will
become
you
when
you
smile
sir
as
well
as
a
dimple
and
if
you
would
salute
your
fair
mistress
but
i
beg
pardon
you
are
a
grave
gentleman
very
grave
to
be
so
hope
i
have
given
no
offence
it
is
my
duty
to
entertain
customers
my
duty
sir
and
my
pleasure
sir
munko
malcrowther
yes
sir
i
dare
say
he
is
at
this
moment
in
ned
for
few
folks
ask
him
out
now
lord
huntinglen
is
gone
to
london
you
will
get
touched
again
yes
sir
there
you
shall
find
him
with
his
can
of
single
ale
stirred
with
a
sprig
of
rosemary
for
he
never
drinks
strong
potations
sir
unless
to
oblige
lord
huntinglen
take
heed
sir
or
any
other
person
who
asks
him
forth
to
breakfast
but
single
beer
he
always
drinks
at
ned
with
his
broiled
bone
of
beef
or
mutton
or
it
may
be
lamb
at
the
season
but
not
pork
though
ned
is
famous
for
his
griskins
but
the
scots
never
eat
pork
strange
that
some
folk
think
they
are
a
sort
of
jews
there
is
a
resemblance
sir
do
you
not
think
so
then
they
call
our
most
gracious
sovereign
the
second
solomon
and
solomon
you
know
was
king
of
the
jews
so
the
thing
bears
a
face
you
see
i
believe
sir
you
will
find
yourself
trimmed
now
to
your
content
i
will
be
judged
by
the
fair
mistress
of
your
affections
crave
pardon
no
offence
i
trust
pray
consult
the
glass
one
touch
of
the
crisping
tongs
to
reduce
this
thank
your
munificence
sir
hope
your
custom
while
you
stay
in
greenwich
would
you
have
a
tune
on
that
ghittern
to
put
your
temper
in
concord
for
the
day
twang
twang
twang
twang
dillo
something
out
of
tune
sir
too
many
hands
to
touch
it
we
can
not
keep
these
things
like
artists
let
me
help
you
with
your
cloak
sir
yes
sir
you
would
not
play
yourself
sir
would
you
way
to
sir
yes
sir
but
it
is
ned
not
sir
the
knight
to
be
sure
eats
there
and
makes
it
his
in
some
sense
sir
ha
ha
yonder
it
is
removed
from
over
the
way
new
posts
and
red
lattice
fat
man
in
his
doublet
at
the
door
ned
himself
sir
worth
a
thousand
pounds
they
say
better
singeing
pigs
faces
than
trimming
courtiers
but
ours
is
the
less
mechanical
farewell
sir
hope
your
so
saying
he
at
length
permitted
nigel
to
depart
whose
ears
so
long
tormented
with
continued
babble
tingled
when
it
had
ceased
as
if
a
bell
had
been
rung
close
to
them
for
the
same
space
of
time
upon
his
arrival
at
the
where
he
proposed
to
meet
with
sir
mungo
malagrowther
from
whom
in
despair
of
better
advice
he
trusted
to
receive
some
information
as
to
the
best
mode
of
introducing
himself
into
the
royal
presence
lord
glenvarloch
found
in
the
host
with
whom
he
communed
the
consequential
taciturnity
of
an
englishman
well
to
pass
in
the
world
ned
kilderkin
spoke
as
a
banker
writes
only
touching
the
needful
being
asked
if
sir
mungo
malagrowther
was
there
he
replied
no
being
interrogated
whether
he
was
expected
he
said
yes
and
being
again
required
to
say
when
he
was
expected
he
answered
presently
as
lord
glenvarloch
next
inquired
whether
he
himself
could
have
any
breakfast
the
landlord
wasted
not
even
a
syllable
in
reply
but
ushering
him
into
a
neat
room
where
there
were
several
tables
he
placed
one
of
them
before
an
armchair
and
beckoning
lord
glenvarloch
to
take
possession
he
set
before
him
in
a
very
few
minutes
a
substantial
repast
of
together
with
a
foaming
tankard
to
which
refreshment
the
keen
air
of
the
river
disposed
him
notwithstanding
his
mental
embarrassments
to
do
much
honour
while
nigel
was
thus
engaged
in
discussing
his
commons
but
raising
his
head
at
the
same
time
whenever
he
heard
the
door
of
the
apartment
open
eagerly
desiring
the
arrival
of
sir
mungo
malagrowther
an
event
which
had
seldom
been
expected
by
any
one
with
so
much
anxious
interest
a
personage
as
it
seemed
of
at
least
equal
importance
with
the
knight
entered
into
the
apartment
and
began
to
hold
earnest
colloquy
with
the
publican
who
thought
proper
to
carry
on
the
conference
on
his
side
unbonneted
this
important
gentleman
occupation
might
be
guessed
from
his
dress
a
jerkin
and
hose
of
white
kersey
a
white
apron
twisted
around
his
body
in
the
manner
of
a
sash
in
which
instead
of
a
dagger
was
stuck
a
knife
hilted
with
a
white
nightcap
on
his
head
under
which
his
hair
was
neatly
tucked
sufficiently
pourtrayed
him
as
one
of
those
priests
of
comus
whom
the
vulgar
call
cooks
and
the
air
with
which
he
rated
the
publican
for
having
neglected
to
send
some
provisions
to
the
palace
showed
that
he
ministered
to
royalty
itself
this
will
never
answer
he
said
master
kilderkin
the
king
twice
asked
for
sweetbreads
and
fricasseed
coxcombs
which
are
a
favourite
dish
of
his
most
sacred
majesty
and
they
were
not
to
be
had
because
master
kilderkin
had
not
supplied
them
to
the
clerk
of
the
kitchen
as
by
bargain
here
kilderkin
made
some
apology
brief
according
to
his
own
nature
and
muttered
in
a
lowly
tone
after
the
fashion
of
all
who
find
themselves
in
a
scrape
his
superior
replied
in
a
lofty
strain
of
voice
do
not
tell
me
of
the
carrier
and
his
wain
and
of
the
coming
from
norfolk
with
the
poultry
a
loyal
man
would
have
sent
an
express
he
would
have
gone
upon
his
stumps
like
widdrington
what
if
the
king
had
lost
his
appetite
master
kilderkin
what
if
his
most
sacred
majesty
had
lost
his
dinner
o
master
kilderkin
if
you
had
but
the
just
sense
of
the
dignity
of
our
profession
which
is
told
of
by
the
witty
african
slave
for
so
the
king
most
excellent
majesty
designates
him
publius
terentius
in
specula
in
patinas
you
are
learned
master
linklater
replied
the
english
publican
compelling
as
it
were
with
difficulty
his
mouth
to
utter
three
or
four
words
consecutively
a
poor
smatterer
said
linklater
but
it
would
be
a
shame
to
us
who
are
his
most
excellent
majesty
countrymen
not
in
some
sort
to
have
cherished
those
arts
wherewith
he
is
so
deeply
embued
ad
master
kilderkin
componitur
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
as
the
king
quotes
the
cook
learns
in
brief
master
kilderkin
having
had
the
luck
to
be
bred
where
humanities
may
be
had
at
the
matter
of
an
english
five
groats
by
the
quarter
i
like
others
have
acquired
here
the
speaker
eye
having
fallen
upon
lord
glenvarloch
he
suddenly
stopped
in
his
learned
harangue
with
such
symptoms
of
embarrassment
as
induced
ned
kilderkin
to
stretch
his
taciturnity
so
far
as
not
only
to
ask
him
what
he
ailed
but
whether
he
would
take
any
thing
ail
nothing
replied
the
learned
rival
of
the
philosophical
syrus
nothing
and
yet
i
do
feel
a
little
giddy
i
could
taste
a
glass
of
your
dame
i
will
fetch
it
said
ned
giving
a
nod
and
his
back
was
no
sooner
turned
than
the
cook
walked
near
the
table
where
lord
glenvarloch
was
seated
and
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
significance
where
more
was
meant
than
met
the
ear
said
you
are
a
stranger
in
greenwich
sir
i
advise
you
to
take
the
opportunity
to
step
into
the
park
the
western
wicket
was
ajar
when
i
came
hither
i
think
it
will
be
locked
presently
so
you
had
better
make
the
best
of
your
way
that
is
if
you
have
any
curiosity
the
venison
are
coming
into
season
just
now
sir
and
there
is
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
a
hart
of
grease
i
always
think
when
they
are
bounding
so
blithely
past
what
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
broach
their
plump
haunches
on
a
spit
and
to
embattle
their
breasts
in
a
noble
fortification
of
with
plenty
of
black
he
said
no
more
as
kilderkin
with
the
cordial
but
edged
off
from
nigel
without
waiting
any
reply
only
repeating
the
same
look
of
intelligence
with
which
he
had
accosted
him
nothing
makes
men
wits
so
alert
as
personal
danger
nigel
took
the
first
opportunity
which
his
host
attention
to
the
yeoman
of
the
royal
kitchen
permitted
to
discharge
his
reckoning
and
readily
obtained
a
direction
to
the
wicket
in
question
he
found
it
upon
the
latch
as
he
had
been
taught
to
expect
and
perceived
that
it
admitted
him
to
a
narrow
footpath
which
traversed
a
close
and
tangled
thicket
designed
for
the
cover
of
the
does
and
the
young
fawns
here
he
conjectured
it
would
be
proper
to
wait
nor
had
he
been
stationary
above
five
minutes
when
the
cook
scalded
as
much
with
heat
of
motion
as
ever
he
had
been
by
his
huge
arrived
almost
breathless
and
with
his
hastily
locked
the
wicket
behind
him
ere
lord
glenvarloch
had
time
to
speculate
upon
this
action
the
man
approached
with
anxiety
and
said
good
lord
my
lord
glenvarloch
why
will
you
endanger
yourself
thus
you
know
me
then
my
friend
said
nigel
not
much
of
that
my
lord
but
i
know
your
honour
noble
house
my
name
is
laurie
linklater
my
linklater
repeated
nigel
i
should
recollect
under
your
lordship
favour
he
continued
i
was
my
lord
to
old
mungo
moniplies
the
flesher
at
the
wanton
of
edinburgh
which
i
wish
i
saw
again
before
i
died
and
your
noble
father
having
taken
richie
moniplies
into
his
house
to
wait
on
your
lordship
there
was
a
sort
of
connexion
your
lordship
ah
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
had
almost
forgot
your
name
but
not
your
kind
purpose
you
tried
to
put
richie
in
the
way
of
presenting
a
supplication
to
his
majesty
most
true
my
lord
replied
the
king
cook
i
had
like
to
have
come
by
mischief
in
the
job
for
richie
who
was
always
wilful
be
guided
by
me
as
the
sang
says
but
nobody
amongst
these
brave
english
cooks
can
kittle
up
his
majesty
most
sacred
palate
with
our
own
gusty
scottish
dishes
so
i
betook
myself
to
my
craft
and
concocted
a
mess
of
friar
chicken
for
the
soup
and
a
savoury
hachis
that
made
the
whole
cabal
coup
the
crans
and
instead
of
disgrace
i
came
by
preferment
i
am
one
of
the
clerks
of
the
kitchen
now
make
me
thankful
with
a
finger
in
the
purveyor
office
and
may
get
my
whole
hand
in
by
and
i
am
truly
glad
said
nigel
to
hear
that
you
have
not
suffered
on
my
account
still
more
so
at
your
good
you
bear
a
kind
heart
my
lord
said
linklater
and
do
not
forget
poor
people
and
troth
i
see
not
why
they
should
be
forgotten
since
the
king
errand
may
sometimes
fall
in
the
cadger
gate
i
have
followed
your
lordship
in
the
street
just
to
look
at
such
a
stately
shoot
of
the
old
and
my
heart
jumped
into
my
throat
when
i
saw
you
sitting
openly
in
the
yonder
and
knew
there
was
such
danger
to
your
what
there
are
warrants
against
me
then
said
nigel
it
is
even
true
my
lord
and
there
are
those
who
are
willing
to
blacken
you
as
much
as
they
god
forgive
them
that
would
sacrifice
an
honourable
house
for
their
own
base
ends
amen
said
nigel
for
say
your
lordship
may
have
been
a
little
wild
like
other
young
gentlemen
we
have
little
time
to
talk
of
it
my
friend
said
nigel
the
point
in
question
is
how
am
i
to
get
speech
of
the
king
the
king
my
lord
said
linklater
in
astonishment
why
will
not
that
be
rushing
wilfully
into
danger
scalding
yourself
as
i
may
say
with
your
own
ladle
my
good
friend
answered
nigel
my
experience
of
the
court
and
my
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
in
which
i
stand
tell
me
that
the
manliest
and
most
direct
road
is
in
my
case
the
surest
and
the
safest
the
king
has
both
a
head
to
apprehend
what
is
just
and
a
heart
to
do
what
is
it
is
true
my
lord
and
so
we
his
old
servants
know
added
linklater
but
woe
me
if
you
knew
how
many
folks
make
it
their
daily
and
nightly
purpose
to
set
his
head
against
his
heart
and
his
heart
against
his
head
to
make
him
do
hard
things
because
they
are
called
just
and
unjust
things
because
they
are
represented
as
kind
woe
me
it
is
with
his
sacred
majesty
and
the
favourites
who
work
upon
him
even
according
to
the
homely
proverb
that
men
taunt
my
calling
with
sends
good
meat
but
the
devil
sends
cooks
it
signifies
not
talking
of
it
my
good
friend
said
nigel
i
must
take
my
risk
my
honour
peremptorily
demands
it
they
may
maim
me
or
beggar
me
but
they
shall
not
say
i
fled
from
my
accusers
my
peers
shall
hear
my
your
peers
exclaimed
the
cook
my
lord
we
are
not
in
scotland
where
the
nobles
can
bang
it
out
bravely
were
it
even
with
the
king
himself
now
and
then
this
mess
must
be
cooked
in
the
and
that
is
an
oven
seven
times
heated
my
lord
and
yet
if
you
are
determined
to
see
the
king
i
will
not
say
but
you
may
find
some
favour
for
he
likes
well
any
thing
that
is
appealed
directly
to
his
own
wisdom
and
sometimes
in
the
like
cases
i
have
known
him
stick
by
his
own
opinion
which
is
always
a
fair
one
only
mind
if
you
will
forgive
me
my
lord
mind
to
spice
high
with
latin
a
curn
or
two
of
greek
would
not
be
amiss
and
if
you
can
bring
in
any
thing
about
the
judgment
of
solomon
in
the
original
hebrew
and
season
with
a
merry
jest
or
so
the
dish
will
be
the
more
truly
i
think
that
besides
my
skill
in
art
i
owe
much
to
the
stripes
of
the
rector
of
the
high
school
who
imprinted
on
my
mind
that
cooking
scene
in
the
leaving
that
aside
my
friend
said
lord
glenvarloch
can
you
inform
me
which
way
i
shall
most
readily
get
to
the
sight
and
speech
of
the
king
to
the
sight
of
him
readily
enough
said
linklater
he
is
galloping
about
these
alleys
to
see
them
strike
the
hart
to
get
him
an
appetite
for
a
nooning
and
that
reminds
me
i
should
be
in
the
kitchen
to
the
speech
of
the
king
you
will
not
come
so
easily
unless
you
could
either
meet
him
alone
which
rarely
chances
or
wait
for
him
among
the
crowd
that
go
to
see
him
alight
and
now
farewell
my
lord
and
god
speed
if
i
could
do
more
for
you
i
would
offer
you
have
done
enough
perhaps
to
endanger
yourself
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
pray
you
to
be
gone
and
leave
me
to
my
the
honest
cook
lingered
but
a
nearer
burst
of
the
horns
apprized
him
that
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
acquainting
nigel
that
he
would
leave
the
on
the
latch
to
secure
his
retreat
in
that
direction
he
bade
god
bless
him
and
farewell
in
the
kindness
of
this
humble
countryman
flowing
partly
from
national
partiality
partly
from
a
sense
of
benefits
which
had
been
scarce
thought
on
by
those
who
had
bestowed
them
lord
glenvarloch
thought
he
saw
the
last
touch
of
sympathy
which
he
was
to
receive
in
this
cold
and
courtly
region
and
felt
that
he
must
now
be
sufficient
to
himself
or
be
utterly
lost
he
traversed
more
than
one
alley
guided
by
the
sounds
of
the
chase
and
met
several
of
the
inferior
attendants
upon
the
king
sport
who
regarded
him
only
as
one
of
the
spectators
who
were
sometimes
permitted
to
enter
the
park
by
the
concurrence
of
the
officers
about
the
court
still
there
was
no
appearance
of
james
or
any
of
his
principal
courtiers
and
nigel
began
to
think
whether
at
the
risk
of
incurring
disgrace
similar
to
that
which
had
attended
the
rash
exploit
of
richie
moniplies
he
should
not
repair
to
the
in
order
to
address
the
king
on
his
return
when
fortune
presented
him
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
in
her
own
way
he
was
in
one
of
those
long
walks
by
which
the
park
was
traversed
when
he
heard
first
a
distant
rustling
then
the
rapid
approach
of
hoofs
shaking
the
firm
earth
on
which
he
stood
then
a
distant
halloo
warned
by
which
he
stood
up
by
the
side
of
the
avenue
leaving
free
room
for
the
passage
of
the
chase
the
stag
reeling
covered
with
foam
and
blackened
with
sweat
his
nostrils
extended
as
he
gasped
for
breath
made
a
shift
to
come
up
as
far
as
where
nigel
stood
and
without
turning
to
bay
was
there
pulled
down
by
two
tall
greyhounds
of
the
breed
still
used
by
the
hardy
of
the
scottish
highlands
but
which
has
been
long
unknown
in
england
one
dog
struck
at
the
throat
another
dashed
his
sharp
nose
and
fangs
i
might
almost
say
into
the
animal
bowels
it
would
have
been
natural
for
lord
glenvarloch
himself
persecuted
as
if
by
hunters
to
have
thought
upon
the
occasion
like
the
melancholy
jacques
but
habit
is
a
strange
matter
and
i
fear
that
his
feelings
on
the
occasion
were
rather
those
of
the
practised
huntsman
than
of
the
moralist
he
had
no
time
however
to
indulge
them
for
mark
what
befell
a
single
horseman
followed
the
chase
upon
a
steed
so
thoroughly
subjected
to
the
rein
that
it
obeyed
the
touch
of
the
bridle
as
if
it
had
been
a
mechanical
impulse
operating
on
the
nicest
piece
of
machinery
so
that
seated
deep
in
his
demipique
saddle
and
so
trussed
up
there
as
to
make
falling
almost
impossible
the
rider
without
either
fear
or
hesitation
might
increase
or
diminish
the
speed
at
which
he
rode
which
even
on
the
most
animating
occasions
of
the
chase
seldom
exceeded
of
a
gallop
the
horse
keeping
his
haunches
under
him
and
never
stretching
forward
beyond
the
managed
pace
of
the
academy
the
security
with
which
he
chose
to
prosecute
even
this
favourite
and
in
the
ordinary
case
somewhat
dangerous
amusement
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
equipage
marked
king
james
no
attendant
was
within
sight
indeed
it
was
often
a
nice
strain
of
flattery
to
permit
the
sovereign
to
suppose
he
had
outridden
and
distanced
all
the
rest
of
the
chase
weel

he
exclaimed
as
he
came
up
by
the
honour
of
a
king

to
the
braes
of
balwhither

called

so
saying
without
casting
an
eye
on
his
assistant
gentle
king
jamie
unsheathing
the
short
sharp
hanger
de
which
was
the
only
thing
approaching
to
a
sword
that
he
could
willingly
endure
the
sight
of
drew
the
blade
with
great
satisfaction
across
the
throat
of
the
buck
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
its
struggles
and
its
agonies
lord
glenvarloch
who
knew
well
the
silvan
duty
which
the
occasion
demanded
hung
the
bridle
of
the
king
palfrey
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
kneeling
duteously
down
turned
the
slaughtered
deer
upon
its
back
and
kept
the
in
that
position
while
the
king
too
intent
upon
his
sport
to
observe
any
thing
else
drew
his
down
the
breast
of
the
animal
and
having
made
a
cross
cut
so
as
to
ascertain
the
depth
of
the
fat
upon
the
chest
exclaimed
in
a
sort
of
rapture
three
inches
of
white
fat
on
the
brisket

accordingly
fawned
upon

licked
him
with
bloody
jaws
and
soon
put
him
in
such
a
state
that
it
might
have
seemed
treason

been
doing
its
full
work
upon
his
anointed
body
bide

with
a

to

cried
the

almost

by

obstreperous
caresses
of
the
large
but

just
like
ither
folks
gie

an

he
said
now
finding
leisure
to
take
a
nearer
view
of
nigel
and
observing
what
in
his
first
emotion
of
silvan
delight
had
escaped
him
ye
are
nane
of
our
train
man
in
the
name
of
god
what
the
devil
are
ye
an
unfortunate
man
sire
replied
nigel
i
dare
say
that
answered
the
king
snappishly
or
i
wad
have
seen
naething
of
you
my
lieges
keep
a
their
happiness
to
themselves
but
let
bowls
row
wrang
wi
them
and
i
am
sure
to
hear
of
and
to
whom
else
can
we
carry
our
complaints
but
to
your
majesty
who
is
heaven
vicegerent
over
us
answered
nigel
right
man
right
very
weel
spoken
said
the
king
but
you
should
leave
heaven
vicegerent
some
quiet
on
earth
if
your
majesty
will
look
on
me
for
hitherto
the
king
had
been
so
busy
first
with
the
dogs
and
then
with
the
mystic
operation
of
in
vulgar
phrase
cutting
up
the
deer
that
he
had
scarce
given
his
assistant
above
a
transient
glance
you
will
see
whom
necessity
makes
bold
to
avail
himself
of
an
opportunity
which
may
never
again
king
james
looked
his
blood
left
his
cheek
though
it
continued
stained
with
that
of
the
animal
which
lay
at
his
feet
he
dropped
the
knife
from
his
hand
cast
behind
him
a
faltering
eye
as
if
he
either
meditated
flight
or
looked
out
for
assistance
and
then
exclaimed
glenvarlochides
as
sure
as
i
was
christened
james
stewart
here
is
a
bonny
spot
of
work
and
me
alone
and
on
foot
too
he
added
bustling
to
get
upon
his
horse
forgive
me
that
i
interrupt
you
my
liege
said
nigel
placing
himself
between
the
king
and
his
steed
hear
me
but
a
moment
i
hear
ye
best
on
horseback
said
the
king
i
canna
hear
a
word
on
foot
man
not
a
word
and
it
is
not
seemly
to
stand
confronting
us
that
gate
bide
out
of
our
gate
sir
we
charge
you
on
your
the
deil
in
them
a
what
can
they
be
doing
by
the
crown
that
you
wear
my
liege
said
nigel
and
for
which
my
ancestors
have
worthily
fought
i
conjure
you
to
be
composed
and
to
hear
me
but
a
moment
that
which
he
asked
was
entirely
out
of
the
monarch
power
to
grant
the
timidity
which
he
showed
was
not
the
plain
downright
cowardice
which
like
a
natural
impulse
compels
a
man
to
flight
and
which
can
excite
little
but
pity
or
contempt
but
a
much
more
ludicrous
as
well
as
more
mingled
sensation
the
poor
king
was
frightened
at
once
and
angry
desirous
of
securing
his
safety
and
at
the
same
time
ashamed
to
compromise
his
dignity
so
that
without
attending
to
what
lord
glenvarloch
endeavoured
to
explain
he
kept
making
at
his
horse
and
repeating
we
are
a
free
king
man
we
are
a
free
king
we
will
not
be
controlled
by
a
in
the
name
of

praised

here
steenie
steenie
the
duke
of
buckingham
galloped
up
followed
by
several
courtiers
and
attendants
of
the
royal
chase
and
commenced
with
his
usual
familiarity
i
see
fortune
has
graced
our
dear

what
this

the

it

olifaunt
himself
a
dozen
of
the
hunters
dismounted
at
once
letting
their
horses
run
wild
through
the
park
some
seized
roughly
on
lord
glenvarloch
who
thought
it
folly
to
offer
resistance

busied
themselves
with

paroxysm
of
his
apprehension
which
by
the
way
might
be
pardoned
in
one
of
so
timorous
a
temper

in

so

and
his

a
shout
of
wonder
and
of
execration
on
the
supposed
criminal
purpose
arose
from
the
crowd
now
thickening
every
moment
not
that
celebrated
pistol
which
though
resting
on
a
bosom
as
gallant
and
as
loyal
as
nigel
spread
such
cause
less
alarm
among
knights
and
dames
at
a
late
high
solemnity
not
that
very
pistol
caused
more
temporary
consternation
than
was
so
groundlessly
excited
by
the
arms
which
were
taken
from
lord
glenvarloch
person
and
not
himself
could
repel
with
greater
scorn
and
indignation
the
insinuations
that
they
were
worn
for
any
sinister
purposes
away
with
the
wretch
the
parricide
the
villain
was
echoed
on
all
hands
and
the
king
who
naturally
enough
set
the
same
value
on
his
own
life
at
which
it
was
or
seemed
to
be
rated
by
others

enough

so
has
the

no

ye
are

ye
have

there
was
a
speedy
sheathing
of
weapons
at
the
king
command
for
those
who
had
hitherto
been
brandishing
them
in
loyal
bravado
began
thereby
to
call
to
mind
the
extreme
dislike
which
his
majesty
nourished
against
naked
steel
a
foible
which
seemed
to
be
as
constitutional
as
his
timidity
and
was
usually
ascribed
to
the
brutal
murder
of
rizzio
having
been
perpetrated
in
his
unfortunate
mother
presence
before
he
yet
saw
the
light
at
this
moment
the
prince
who
had
been
hunting
in
a
different
part
of
the
then
extensive
park
and
had
received
some
hasty
and
confused
information
of
what
was
going
forward
came
rapidly
up
with
one
or
two
noblemen
in
his
train
and
amongst
others
lord
dalgarno
he
sprung
from
his
horse
and
asked
eagerly
if
his
father
were
wounded

that
i
am
sensible
of

the

after
he
had
taken
this

of
comfort
o
man

and
you
have
had
a
fair
escape
from
the
heavy
and

of

at

idea
of
the

which
must
have
attended

the

cried
heartily

said
charles
sternly
for
his
pride
was
hurt
at
his
father
demeanour
on
the
one
hand
while
on
the
other
he
felt
the
resentment
of
a
son
and
a
subject
at
the
supposed
attempt
on
the
king
life
let
some
one
speak
who
has
seen
what
happened
my
lord
of
buckingham
i
can
not
say
my
lord
replied
the
duke
that
i
saw
any
actual
violence
offered
to
his
majesty
else
i
should
have
avenged
him
on
the
you
would
have
done
wrong
then
in
your
zeal
george
answered
the
prince
such
offenders
were
better
left
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
laws
but
was
the
villain
not
struggling
with
his
majesty
i
can
not
term
it
so
my
lord
said
the
duke
who
with
many
faults
would
have
disdained
an
untruth
he
seemed
to
desire
to
detain
his
majesty
who
on
the
contrary
appeared
to
wish
to
mount
his
horse
but
they
have
found
pistols
on
his
person
contrary
to
the
proclamation
and
as
it
proves
to
be
by
nigel
olifaunt
of
whose
ungoverned
disposition
your
royal
highness
has
seen
some
samples
we
seem
to
be
justified
in
apprehending
the
nigel
olifaunt
said
the
prince
can
that
unhappy
man
so
soon
have
engaged
in
a
new
trespass
let
me
see
those
ye
are
not
so
unwise
as
to
meddle
with
such
baby
charles
said
james
do
not
give
him
them
steenie
i
command
you
on
your
allegiance
they
may
go
off
of
their
own
accord
whilk
often
you
will
do
it
then
saw
ever
a
man
sic
wilful
bairns
as
we
are
cumbered
with
havena
we
guardsmen
and
soldiers
enow
but
you
must
unload
the
weapons

heir
of
our
body
and
dignities
and
sae
mony
men
around
that
are
paid
for
venturing
life
in
our
cause
but
without
regarding
his
father
exclamations
prince
charles
with
the
obstinacy
which
characterised
him
in
trifles
as
well
as
matters
of
consequence
persisted
in
unloading
the
pistols
with
his
own
hand
of
the
double
bullets
with
which
each
was
charged
the
hands
of
all
around
were
held
up
in
astonishment
at
the
horror
of
the
crime
supposed
to
have
been
intended
and
the
escape
which
was
presumed
so
narrow
nigel
had
not
yet
spoken
a
word
he
now
calmly
desired
to
be
heard
to
what
purpose
answered
the
prince
coldly
you
knew
yourself
accused
of
a
heavy
offence
and
instead
of
rendering
yourself
up
to
justice
in
terms
of
the
proclamation
you
are
here
found
intruding
yourself
on
his
majesty
presence
and
armed
with
unlawful
may
it
please
you
sir
answered
nigel
i
wore
these
unhappy
weapons
for
my
own
defence
and
not
very
many
hours
since
they
were
necessary
to
protect
the
lives
of
doubtless
my
lord
answered
the
prince
still
calm
and
unmoved
your
late
mode
of
life
and
the
associates
with
whom
you
have
lived
have
made
you
familiar
with
scenes
and
weapons
of
violence
but
it
is
not
to
me
you
are
to
plead
your
hear
me

me
noble
prince
said
nigel
eagerly
hear
me
you
even
you
yourself
may
one
day
ask
to
be

in
how
sir
said
the
prince
haughtily
how
am
i
to
construe
that
my
lord

not

replied
the
prisoner
yet
to

we
must
all
pray
for

my
lord
said
the
prince
bending
his
head
with
haughty
acquiescence
nor
would
i
now
refuse
such
audience
to
you
could
it
avail
you
but
you
shall
suffer
no

and
in

meanwhile
have
him
and
his

away
for
i
am
weary
of
the

of

of
directions
hastily
given
nigel
was
accordingly
removed
from
the
presence
where
however
his
words
had
not
altogether
fallen
to
the
ground
this
is
a
most
strange
matter
george
said
the
prince
to
the
favourite
this
gentleman
hath
a
good
countenance
a
happy
presence
and
much
calm
firmness
in
his
look
and
speech
i
can
not
think
he
would
attempt
a
crime
so
desperate
and
i
profess
neither
love
nor
favour
to
the
young
man
answered
buckingham
whose
ambition
bore
always
an
open
character
but
i
can
not
but
agree
with
your
highness
that
our
dear
gossip
hath
been
something
hasty
in
apprehending
personal
danger
from
by
my
saul
steenie
ye
are
not
blate
to
say
so
said
the
king
do
i
not
ken
the
smell
of
pouther
think
ye
who
else
nosed
out
the
fifth
of
november
save
our
royal
selves
cecil
and
suffolk
and
all
of
them
were
at
fault
like
sae
mony
mongrel
tikes
when
i
puzzled
it
out
and
trow
ye
that
i
can
not
smell
pouther
why
man
joannes
barclaius

saith
of
us
divinitus
the
land
was
happy
in
your
majesty
escape
said
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
not
less
in
the
quick
wit
which
tracked
that
labyrinth
of
treason
by
so
fine
and
almost
invisible
a
saul
man
steenie
ye
are
right
there
are
few
youths
have
sic
true
judgment
as
you
respecting
the
wisdom
of
their
elders
and
as
for
this
fause
traitorous
smaik
i
doubt
he
is
a
hawk
of
the
same
nest
saw
ye
not
something
papistical
about
him
let
them
look
that
he
bears
not
a
crucifix
or
some
sic
roman
trinket
about
it
would
ill
become
me
to
attempt
the
exculpation
of
this
unhappy
man
said
lord
dalgarno
considering
the
height
of
his
present
attempt
which
has
made
all
true
men
blood
curdle
in
their
veins
yet
i
can
not
avoid
intimating
with
all
due
submission
to
his
majesty
infallible
judgment
in
justice
to
one
who
showed
himself
formerly
only
my
enemy
though
he
now
displays
himself
in
much
blacker
colours
that
this
olifaunt
always
appeared
to
me
more
as
a
puritan
than
as
a
ah
dalgarno
art
thou
there
man
said
the
king
and
ye
behoved
to
keep
back
too
and
leave
us
to
our
own
natural
strength
and
the
care
of
providence
when
we
were
in
grips
with
the
villain
providence
may
it
please
your
most
gracious
majesty
would
not
fail
to
aid
in
such
a
strait
the
care
of
three
weeping
kingdoms
said
lord
dalgarno
surely
man
surely
replied
the
king
but
a
sight
of
your
father
with
his
long
whinyard
would
have
been
a
blithe
matter
a
short
while
syne
and
in
future
we
will
aid
the
ends
of
providence
in
our
favour
by
keeping
near
us
two
stout
of
the
and
so
this
olifaunt
is
a
puritan
not
the
less
like
to
be
a
papist
for
all
that
for
extremities
meet
as
the
scholiast
proveth
there
are
as
i
have
proved
in

of
papistical
principles
it
is
just
a
new
tout
on
an
old
here
the
king
was
reminded
by
the
prince
who
dreaded
perhaps
that
he
was
going
to
recite
the
whole
basilicon
doron
that
it
would
be
best
to
move
towards
the
palace
and
consider
what
was
to
be
done
for
satisfying
the
public
mind
in
whom
the
morning
adventure
was
likely
to
excite
much
speculation
as
they
entered
the
gate
of
the
palace
a
female
bowed
and
presented
a
paper
which
the
king
received
and
with
a
sort
of
groan
thrust
it
into
his
side
pocket
the
prince
expressed
some
curiosity
to
know
its
contents

placed
in

with

rowed
up

fast
as

stout
watermen

against

passed
the

few
steps
followed
by
the
lieutenant
and
a
warder
of
the
higher
class
they
entered
a
large
but
irregular
and
dark
apartment
exhibiting
a
very
scanty
proportion
of
furniture
the
warder
had
orders
to
light
a
fire
and
attend
to
lord
glenvarloch
commands
in
all
things
consistent
with
his
duty
and
the
lieutenant
having
made
his
reverence
with
the
customary
compliment
that
he
trusted
his
lordship
would
not
long
remain
under
his
guardianship
took
his
leave
nigel
would
have
asked
some
questions
of
the
warder
who
remained
to
put
the
apartment
into
order
but
the
man
had
caught
the
spirit
of
his
office
he
seemed
not
to
hear
some
of
the
prisoner
questions
though
of
the
most
ordinary
kind
did
not
reply
to
others
and
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
a
short
and
sullen
tone
which
though
not
positively
disrespectful
was
such
as
at
least
to
encourage
no
farther
communication
nigel
left
him
therefore
to
do
his
work
in
silence
and
proceeded
to
amuse
himself
with
the
melancholy
task
of
deciphering
the
names
mottoes
verses
and
hieroglyphics
with
which
his
predecessors
in
captivity
had
covered
the
walls
of
their
there
he
saw
the
names
of
many
a
forgotten
sufferer
mingled
with
others
which
will
continue
in
remembrance
until
english
history
shall
perish
there
were
the
pious
effusions
of
the
devout
catholic
poured
forth
on
the
eve
of
his
sealing
his
profession
at
tyburn
mingled
with
those
of
the
firm
protestant
about
to
feed
the
fires
of
smithfield
there
the
slender
hand
of
the
unfortunate
jane
grey
whose
fate
was
to
draw
tears
from
future
generations
might
be
contrasted
with
the
bolder
touch
which
impressed
deep
on
the
walls
the
bear
and
ragged
staff
the
proud
emblem
of
the
proud
dudleys
it
was
like
the
roll
of
the
prophet
a
record
of
lamentation
and
mourning
and
yet
not
unmixed
with
brief
interjections
of
resignation
and
sentences
expressive
of
the
firmest
resolution
footnote
these
memorials
of
illustrious
criminals
or
of
innocent
persons
who
had
the
fate
of
such
are
still
preserved
though
at
one
time
in
the
course
of
repairing
the
rooms
they
were
in
some
danger
of
being
whitewashed
they
are
preserved
at
present
with
becoming
respect
and
have
most
of
them
been
bayley
and
antiquities
of
the
tower
of
in
the
sad
task
of
examining
the
miseries
of
his
predecessors
in
captivity
lord
glenvarloch
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
of
his
it
was
the
warder
who
came
to
inform
him
that
by
order
of
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
his
lordship
was
to
have
the
society
and
attendance
of
a
in
his
place
of
confinement
nigel
replied
hastily
that
he
wished
no
attendance
and
would
rather
be
left
alone
but
the
warder
gave
him
to
understand
with
a
kind
of
grumbling
civility
that
the
lieutenant
was
the
best
judge
how
his
prisoners
should
be
accommodated
and
that
he
would
have
no
trouble
with
the
boy
who
was
such
a
slip
of
a
thing
as
was
scarce
worth
turning
a
key
there
giles
he
said
bring
the
child
another
warder
put
the
lad
before
him
into
the
room
and
both
withdrawing
bolt
crashed
and
chain
clanged
as
they
replaced
these
ponderous
obstacles
to
freedom
the
boy
was
clad
in
a
grey
suit
of
the
finest
cloth
laid
down
with
silver
lace
with
a
cloak
of
the
same
pattern
his
cap
which
was
a
montero
of
black
velvet
was
pulled
over
his
brows
and
with
the
profusion
of
his
long
ringlets
almost
concealed
his
face
he
stood
on
the
very
spot
where
the
warder
had
quitted
his
collar
about
two
steps
from
the
door
of
the
apartment
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
every
joint
trembling
with
confusion
and
terror
nigel
could
well
have
dispensed
with
his
society
but
it
was
not
in
his
nature
to
behold
distress
whether
of
body
or
mind
without
endeavouring
to
relieve
it
cheer
up
he
said
my
pretty
lad
we
are
to
be
companions
it
seems
for
a
little
time
at
least
i
trust
your
confinement
will
be
short
since
you
are
too
young
to
have
done
aught
to
deserve
long
restraint
come
come
do
not
be
discouraged
your
hand
is
cold
and
trembles
the
air
is
warm
too
but
it
may
be
the
damp
of
this
darksome
room
place
you
by
the
what
my
little
man
i
pray
you
do
not
be
a
child
you
have
no
beard
yet
to
be
dishonoured
by
your
tears
but
yet
you
should
not
cry
like
a
girl
think
you
are
only
shut
up
for
playing
truant
and
you
can
pass
a
day
without
weeping
the
boy
suffered
himself
to
be
led
and
seated
by
the
fire
but
after
retaining
for
a
long
time
the
very
posture
which
he
assumed
in
sitting
down
he
suddenly
changed
it
in
order
to
wring
his
hands
with
an
air
of
the
bitterest
distress
and
then
spreading
them
before
his
face
wept
so
plentifully
that
the
tears
found
their
way
in
floods
through
his
slender
fingers
nigel
was
in
some
degree
rendered
insensible
to
his
own
situation
by
his
feelings
for
the
intense
agony
by
which
so
young
and
beautiful
a
creature
seemed
to
be
utterly
overwhelmed
and
sitting
down
close
beside
the
boy
he
applied
the
most
soothing
terms
which
occurred
to
endeavour
to
alleviate
his
distress
and
with
an
action
which
the
difference
of
their
age
rendered
natural
drew
his
hand
kindly
along
the
long
hair
of
the
disconsolate
child
the
lad
appeared
so
shy
as
even
to
shrink
from
this
slight
approach
to
familiarity
yet
when
lord
glenvarloch
perceiving
and
allowing
for
his
timidity
sat
down
on
the
farther
side
of
the
fire
he
appeared
to
be
more
at
his
ease
and
to
hearken
with
some
apparent
interest
to
the
arguments
which
from
time
to
time
nigel
used
to
induce
him
to
moderate
at
least
the
violence
of
his
grief
as
the
boy
listened
his
tears
though
they
continued
to
flow
freely
seemed
to
escape
from
their
source
more
easily
his
sobs
were
less
convulsive
and
became
gradually
changed
into
low
sighs
which
succeeded
each
other
indicating
as
much
sorrow
perhaps
but
less
alarm
than
his
first
transports
had
shown
tell
me
who
and
what
you
are
my
pretty
boy
said
consider
me
child
as
a
companion
who
wishes
to
be
kind
to
you
would
you
but
teach
him
how
he
can
be
sir
my
lord
i
mean
answered
the
boy
very
timidly
and
in
a
voice
which
could
scarce
be
heard
even
across
the
brief
distance
which
divided
them
you
are
very
good
and
i
am
very
unhappy
a
second
fit
of
tears
interrupted
what
else
he
had
intended
to
say
and
it
required
a
renewal
of
lord
glenvarloch
expostulations
and
encouragements
to
bring
him
once
more
to
such
composure
as
rendered
the
lad
capable
of
expressing
himself
intelligibly
at
length
however
he
was
able
to
say
i
am
sensible
of
your
goodness
my
lord
and
grateful
for
it
but
i
am
a
poor
unhappy
creature
and
what
is
worse
have
myself
only
to
thank
for
my
we
are
seldom
absolutely
miserable
my
young
acquaintance
said
nigel
without
being
ourselves
more
or
less
responsible
for
it
i
may
well
say
so
otherwise
i
had
not
been
here
but
you
are
very
young
and
can
have
but
little
to
answer
o
sir
i
wish
i
could
say
so
i
have
been
and
obstinate
and
rash
and
ungovernable
and
now
now
how
dearly
do
i
pay
the
price
of
it
pshaw
my
boy
replied
nigel
this
must
be
some
childish
frolic
some
breaking
out
of
bounds
some
truant
trick
and
yet
how
should
any
of
these
have
brought
you
to
the
tower
there
is
something
mysterious
about
you
young
man
which
i
must
inquire
indeed
indeed
my
lord
there
is
no
harm
about
me
said
the
boy
more
moved
it
would
seem
to
confession
by
the
last
words
by
which
he
seemed
considerably
alarmed
than
by
all
the
kind
expostulations
and
arguments
which
nigel
had
previously
used
i
am
innocent
that
is
i
have
done
wrong
but
nothing
to
deserve
being
in
this
frightful
tell
me
the
truth
then
said
nigel
in
a
tone
in
which
command
mingled
with
encouragement
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
and
as
little
to
hope
perhaps
yet
placed
as
i
am
i
would
know
with
whom
i
with
an
unhappy
boy
sir
and
idle
and
truantly
disposed
as
your
lordship
said
answered
the
lad
looking
up
and
showing
a
countenance
in
which
paleness
and
blushes
succeeded
each
other
as
fear
and
shamefacedness
alternately
had
influence
i
left
my
father
house
without
leave
to
see
the
king
hunt
in
the
park
at
greenwich
there
came
a
cry
of
treason
and
all
the
gates
were
shut
i
was
frightened
and
hid
myself
in
a
thicket
and
i
was
found
by
some
of
the
rangers
and
examined
and
they
said
i
gave
no
good
account
of
myself
and
so
i
was
sent
i
am
an
unhappy
a
most
unhappy
being
said
lord
glenvarloch
rising
and
walking
through
the
apartment
nothing
approaches
me
but
shares
my
own
bad
fate
death
and
imprisonment
dog
my
steps
and
involve
all
who
are
found
near
me
yet
this
boy
story
sounds
you
say
you
were
examined
my
young
friend
let
me
pray
you
to
say
whether
you
told
your
name
and
your
means
of
gaining
admission
into
the
park
if
so
they
surely
would
not
have
detained
you
o
my
lord
said
the
boy
i
took
care
not
to
tell
them
the
name
of
the
friend
that
let
me
in
and
as
to
my
father
i
would
not
he
knew
where
i
now
am
for
all
the
wealth
in
london
but
do
you
not
expect
said
nigel
that
they
will
dismiss
you
till
you
let
them
know
who
and
what
you
are
what
good
will
it
do
them
to
keep
so
useless
a
creature
as
myself
said
the
boy
they
must
let
me
go
were
it
but
out
of
do
not
trust
to
that
tell
me
your
name
and
station
i
will
communicate
them
to
the
lieutenant
he
is
a
man
of
quality
and
honour
and
will
not
only
be
willing
to
procure
your
liberation
but
also
i
have
no
doubt
will
intercede
with
your
father
i
am
partly
answerable
for
such
poor
aid
as
i
can
afford
to
get
you
out
of
this
embarrassment
since
i
occasioned
the
alarm
owing
to
which
you
were
arrested
so
tell
me
your
name
and
your
father
my
name
to
you
o
never
never
answered
the
boy
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
the
cause
of
which
nigel
could
not
comprehend
are
you
so
much
afraid
of
me
young
man
he
replied
because
i
am
here
accused
and
a
prisoner
consider
a
man
may
be
both
and
deserve
neither
suspicion
nor
restraint
why
should
you
distrust
me
you
seem
friendless
and
i
am
myself
so
much
in
the
same
circumstances
that
i
can
not
but
pity
your
situation
when
i
reflect
on
my
own
be
wise
i
have
spoken
kindly
to
you
i
mean
as
kindly
as
i
o
i
doubt
it
not
i
doubt
it
not
my
lord
said
the
boy
and
i
could
tell
you
all
that
is
almost
tell
me
nothing
my
young
friend
excepting
what
may
assist
me
in
being
useful
to
you
said
nigel
you
are
generous
my
lord
said
the
boy
and
i
am
sure
o
sure
i
might
safely
trust
to
your
honour
but
yet
but
yet
i
am
so
sore
beset
i
have
been
so
rash
so
unguarded
i
can
never
tell
you
of
my
folly
besides
i
have
already
told
too
much
to
one
whose
heart
i
thought
i
had
moved
yet
i
find
myself
to
whom
did
you
make
this
disclosure
said
nigel
i
dare
not
tell
replied
the
youth
there
is
something
singular
about
you
my
young
friend
said
lord
glenvarloch
withdrawing
with
a
gentle
degree
of
compulsion
the
hand
with
which
the
boy
had
again
covered
his
eyes
do
not
pain
yourself
with
thinking
on
your
situation
just
at
present
your
pulse
is
high
and
your
hand
feverish
lay
yourself
on
yonder
pallet
and
try
to
compose
yourself
to
sleep
it
is
the
readiest
and
best
remedy
for
the
fancies
with
which
you
are
worrying
i
thank
you
for
your
considerate
kindness
my
lord
said
the
boy
with
your
leave
i
will
remain
for
a
little
space
quiet
in
this
chair
i
am
better
thus
than
on
the
couch
i
can
think
undisturbedly
on
what
i
have
done
and
have
still
to
do
and
if
god
sends
slumber
to
a
creature
so
exhausted
it
shall
be
most
so
saying
the
boy
drew
his
hand
from
lord
nigel
and
drawing
around
him
and
partly
over
his
face
the
folds
of
his
ample
cloak
he
resigned
himself
to
sleep
or
meditation
while
his
companion
notwithstanding
the
exhausting
scenes
of
this
and
the
preceding
day
continued
his
pensive
walk
up
and
down
the
apartment
every
reader
has
experienced
that
times
occur
when
far
from
being
lord
of
external
circumstances
man
is
unable
to
rule
even
the
wayward
realm
of
his
own
thoughts
it
was
nigel
natural
wish
to
consider
his
own
situation
coolly
and
fix
on
the
course
which
it
became
him
as
a
man
of
sense
and
courage
to
adopt
and
yet
in
spite
of
himself
and
notwithstanding
the
deep
interest
of
the
critical
state
in
which
he
was
placed
it
did
so
happen
that
his
situation
occupied
more
of
his
thoughts
than
did
his
own
there
was
no
accounting
for
this
wandering
of
the
imagination
but
also
there
was
no
striving
with
it
the
pleading
tones
of
one
of
the
sweetest
voices
he
had
ever
heard
still
rung
in
his
ear
though
it
seemed
that
sleep
had
now
fettered
the
tongue
of
the
speaker
he
drew
near
on
tiptoe
to
satisfy
himself
whether
it
were
so
the
folds
of
the
cloak
hid
the
lower
part
of
his
face
entirely
but
the
bonnet
which
had
fallen
a
little
aside
permitted
him
to
see
the
forehead
streaked
with
blue
veins
the
closed
eyes
and
the
long
silken
eyelashes
poor
child
said
nigel
to
himself
as
he
looked
on
him
nestled
up
as
it
were
in
the
folds
of
his
mantle
the
dew
is
yet
on
thy
eyelashes
and
thou
hast
fairly
wept
thyself
asleep
sorrow
is
a
rough
nurse
to
one
so
young
and
delicate
as
thou
art
peace
be
to
thy
slumbers
i
will
not
disturb
them
my
own
misfortunes
require
my
attention
and
it
is
to
their
contemplation
that
i
must
resign
he
attempted
to
do
so
but
was
crossed
at
every
turn
by
conjectures
which
intruded
themselves
as
before
and
which
all
regarded
the
sleeper
rather
than
himself
he
was
angry
and
vexed
and
expostulated
with
himself
concerning
the
overweening
interest
which
he
took
in
the
concerns
of
one
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
saving
that
the
boy
was
forced
into
his
company
perhaps
as
a
spy
by
those
to
whose
custody
he
was
committed
but
the
spell
could
not
be
broken
and
the
thoughts
which
he
struggled
to
dismiss
continued
to
haunt
him
thus
passed
half
an
hour
or
more
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
harsh
sound
of
the
revolving
bolts
was
again
heard
and
the
voice
of
the
warder
announced
that
a
man
desired
to
speak
with
lord
glenvarloch
a
man
to
speak
with
me
under
my
present
circumstances
who
can
it
be
and
john
christie
his
landlord
of
paul
wharf
resolved
his
doubts
by
entering
the
apartment
welcome
most
welcome
mine
honest
landlord
said
lord
glenvarloch
how
could
i
have
dreamt
of
seeing
you
in
my
present
close
lodgings
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
frankness
of
old
kindness
he
walked
up
to
christie
and
offered
his
hand
but
john
started
back
as
from
the
look
of
a
basilisk
keep
your
courtesies
to
yourself
my
lord
said
he
gruffly
i
have
had
as
many
of
them
already
as
may
serve
me
for
my
why
master
christie
said
nigel
what
means
this
i
trust
i
have
not
offended
you
ask
me
no
questions
my
lord
said
christie
bluntly
i
am
a
man
of
peace
i
came
not
hither
to
wrangle
with
you
at
this
place
and
season
just
suppose
that
i
am
well
informed
of
all
the
obligements
from
your
honour
nobleness
and
then
acquaint
me
in
as
few
words
as
may
be
where
is
the
unhappy
woman
what
have
you
done
with
her
what
have
i
done
with
her
said
lord
glenvarloch
done
with
whom
i
know
not
what
you
are
speaking
oh
yes
my
lord
said
christie
play
surprise
as
well
as
you
will
you
must
have
some
guess
that
i
am
speaking
of
the
poor
fool
that
was
my
wife
till
she
became
your
lordship
your
wife
has
your
wife
left
you
and
if
she
has
do
you
come
to
ask
her
of
me
yes
my
lord
singular
as
it
may
seem
returned
christie
in
a
tone
of
bitter
irony
and
with
a
sort
of
grin
widely
discording
from
the
discomposure
of
his
features
the
gleam
of
his
eye
and
the
froth
which
stood
on
his
lip
i
do
come
to
make
that
demand
of
your
lordship
doubtless
you
are
surprised
i
should
take
the
trouble
but
i
can
not
tell
great
men
and
little
men
think
differently
she
has
lain
in
my
bosom
and
drunk
of
my
cup
and
such
as
she
is
i
can
not
forget
that
though
i
will
never
see
her
again
she
must
not
starve
my
lord
or
do
worse
to
gain
bread
though
i
reckon
your
lordship
may
think
i
am
robbing
the
public
in
trying
to
change
her
by
my
faith
as
a
christian
by
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
said
lord
glenvarloch
if
aught
amiss
has
chanced
with
your
wife
i
know
nothing
of
it
i
trust
in
heaven
you
are
as
much
mistaken
in
imputing
guilt
to
her
as
in
supposing
me
her
partner
in
fie
fie
my
lord
said
christie
why
will
you
make
it
so
tough
she
is
but
the
wife
of
a
old
chandler
who
was
idiot
enough
to
marry
a
wench
twenty
years
younger
than
himself
your
lordship
can
not
have
more
glory
by
it
than
you
have
had
already
and
as
for
advantage
and
solace
i
take
it
dame
nelly
is
now
unnecessary
to
your
gratification
i
should
be
sorry
to
interrupt
the
course
of
your
pleasure
an
old
wittol
should
have
more
consideration
of
his
condition
but
your
precious
lordship
being
mewed
up
here
among
other
choice
jewels
of
the
kingdom
dame
nelly
can
not
i
take
it
be
admitted
to
share
the
hours
of
dalliance
which
here
the
incensed
husband
stammered
broke
off
his
tone
of
irony
and
proceeded
striking
his
staff
against
the
ground
o
that
these
false
limbs
of
yours
which
i
wish
had
been
hamstrung
when
they
first
crossed
my
honest
threshold
were
free
from
the
fetters
they
have
well
deserved
i
would
give
you
the
odds
of
your
youth
and
your
weapon
and
would
bequeath
my
soul
to
the
foul
fiend
if
i
with
this
piece
of
oak
did
not
make
you
such
an
example
to
all
ungrateful
courtiers
that
it
should
be
a
proverb
to
the
end
of
time
how
john
christie
swaddled
his
wife
fine
leman
i
understand
not
your
insolence
said
nigel
but
i
forgive
it
because
you
labour
under
some
strange
delusion
in
so
far
as
i
can
comprehend
your
vehement
charge
it
is
entirely
undeserved
on
my
part
you
seem
to
impute
to
me
the
seduction
of
your
wife
i
trust
she
is
innocent
for
me
at
least
she
is
as
innocent
as
an
angel
in
bliss
i
never
thought
of
her
never
touched
her
hand
or
cheek
save
in
honourable
o
ay
courtesy
that
is
the
very
word
she
always
praised
your
lordship
honourable
courtesy
ye
have
cozened
me
between
ye
with
your
courtesy
my
lord
my
lord
you
came
to
us
no
very
wealthy
man
you
know
it
it
was
for
no
lucre
of
gain
i
took
you
and
your
your
don
diego
yonder
under
my
poor
roof
i
never
cared
if
the
little
room
were
let
or
no
i
could
live
without
it
if
you
could
not
have
paid
for
it
you
should
never
have
been
asked
all
the
wharf
knows
john
christie
has
the
means
and
spirit
to
do
a
kindness
when
you
first
darkened
my
honest
doorway
i
was
as
happy
as
a
man
need
to
be
who
is
no
youngster
and
has
the
rheumatism
nelly
was
the
kindest
and
wench
we
might
have
a
word
now
and
then
about
a
gown
or
a
ribbon
but
a
kinder
soul
on
the
whole
and
a
more
careful
considering
her
years
till
you
come
and
what
is
she
now
but
i
will
not
be
a
fool
to
cry
if
i
can
help
it
she
is
is
not
the
question
but
where
she
is
and
that
i
must
learn
sir
of
how
can
you
when
i
tell
you
replied
nigel
that
i
am
as
ignorant
as
yourself
or
rather
much
more
so
till
this
moment
i
never
heard
of
any
disagreement
betwixt
your
dame
and
that
is
a
lie
said
john
christie
bluntly
how
you
base
villain
said
lord
glenvarloch
do
you
presume
on
my
situation
if
it
were
not
that
i
hold
you
mad
and
perhaps
made
so
by
some
wrong
sustained
you
should
find
my
being
weaponless
were
no
protection
i
would
beat
your
brains
out
against
the
ay
ay
answered
christie
bully
as
ye
list
ye
have
been
at
the
ordinaries
and
in
alsatia
and
learned
the
ruffian
rant
i
doubt
not
but
i
repeat
you
have
spoken
an
untruth
when
you
said
you
knew
not
of
my
wife
falsehood
for
when
you
were
twitted
with
it
among
your
gay
mates
it
was
a
common
jest
among
you
and
your
lordship
took
all
the
credit
they
would
give
you
for
your
gallantry
and
there
was
a
mixture
of
truth
in
this
part
of
the
charge
which
disconcerted
lord
glenvarloch
exceedingly
for
he
could
not
as
a
man
of
honour
deny
that
lord
dalgarno
and
others
had
occasionally
jested
with
him
on
the
subject
of
dame
nelly
and
that
though
he
had
not
played
exactly
fanfaron
des
vices
he
had
not
at
least
been
sufficiently
anxious
to
clear
himself
of
the
suspicion
of
such
a
crime
to
men
who
considered
it
as
a
merit
it
was
therefore
with
some
hesitation
and
in
a
sort
of
qualifying
tone
that
he
admitted
that
some
idle
jests
had
passed
upon
such
a
supposition
although
without
the
least
foundation
in
truth
john
christie
would
not
listen
to
his
vindication
any
longer
by
your
own
account
he
said
you
permitted
lies
to
be
told
of
you
injest
how
do
i
know
you
are
speaking
truth
now
you
are
serious
you
thought
it
i
suppose
a
fine
thing
to
wear
the
reputation
of
having
dishonoured
an
honest
family
who
will
not
think
that
you
had
real
grounds
for
your
base
bravado
to
rest
upon
i
will
not
believe
otherwise
for
one
and
therefore
my
lord
mark
what
i
have
to
say
you
are
now
yourself
in
trouble
as
you
hope
to
come
through
it
safely
and
without
loss
of
life
and
property
tell
me
where
this
unhappy
woman
is
tell
me
if
you
hope
for
heaven
tell
me
if
you
fear
hell
tell
me
as
you
would
not
have
the
curse
of
an
utterly
ruined
woman
and
a
man
attend
you
through
life
and
bear
witness
against
you
at
the
great
day
which
shall
come
after
death
you
are
moved
my
lord
i
see
it
i
can
not
forget
the
wrong
you
have
done
me
i
can
not
even
promise
to
forgive
it
but
tell
me
and
you
shall
never
see
me
again
or
hear
more
of
my
unfortunate
man
said
lord
glenvarloch
you
have
said
more
far
more
than
enough
to
move
me
deeply
were
i
at
liberty
i
would
lend
you
my
best
aid
to
search
out
him
who
has
wronged
you
the
rather
that
i
do
suspect
my
having
been
your
lodger
has
been
in
some
degree
the
remote
cause
of
bringing
the
spoiler
into
the
i
am
glad
your
lordship
grants
me
so
much
said
john
christie
resuming
the
tone
of
embittered
irony
with
which
he
had
opened
the
singular
conversation
i
will
spare
you
farther
reproach
and
remonstrance
your
mind
is
made
up
and
so
is
so
ho
warder
the
warder
entered
and
john
went
on
i
want
to
get
out
brother
look
well
to
your
charge
it
were
better
that
half
the
wild
beasts
in
their
dens
yonder
were
turned
loose
upon
tower
hill
than
that
this
same
gentleman
were
again
returned
to
honest
men
company
so
saying
he
hastily
left
the
apartment
and
nigel
had
full
leisure
to
lament
the
waywardness
of
his
fate
which
seemed
never
to
tire
of
persecuting
him
for
crimes
of
which
he
was
innocent
and
investing
him
with
the
appearances
of
guilt
which
his
mind
abhorred
he
could
not
however
help
acknowledging
to
himself
that
all
the
pain
which
he
might
sustain
from
the
present
accusation
of
john
christie
was
so
far
deserved
from
his
having
suffered
himself
out
of
vanity
or
rather
an
unwillingness
to
encounter
ridicule
to
be
supposed
capable
of
a
base
inhospitable
crime
merely
because
fools
called
it
an
affair
of
gallantry
and
it
was
no
balsam
to
the
wound
when
he
recollected
what
richie
had
told
him
of
his
having
been
ridiculed
behind
his
back
by
the
gallants
of
the
ordinary
for
affecting
the
reputation
of
an
intrigue
which
he
had
not
in
reality
spirit
enough
to
have
carried
on
his
simulation
had
in
a
word
placed
him
in
the
unlucky
predicament
of
being
rallied
as
a
braggart
amongst
the
dissipated
youths
with
whom
the
reality
of
the
amour
would
have
given
him
credit
whilst
on
the
other
hand
he
was
branded
as
an
inhospitable
seducer
by
the
injured
husband
who
was
obstinately
persuaded
of
his
guilt
chapter
xxix
how
fares
the
man
on
whom
good
men
would
look
with
eyes
where
scorn
and
censure
combated
but
that
kind
christian
love
hath
taught
the
lesson
that
they
who
merit
most
contempt
and
hate
do
most
deserve
our
it
might
have
seemed
natural
that
the
visit
of
john
christie
should
have
entirely
diverted
nigel
attention
from
his
slumbering
companion
and
for
a
time
such
was
the
immediate
effect
of
the
chain
of
new
ideas
which
the
incident
introduced
yet
soon
after
the
injured
man
had
departed
lord
glenvarloch
began
to
think
it
extraordinary
that
the
boy
should
have
slept
so
soundly
while
they
talked
loudly
in
his
vicinity
yet
he
certainly
did
not
appear
to
have
stirred
was
he
well
was
he
only
feigning
sleep
he
went
close
to
him
to
make
his
observations
and
perceived
that
he
had
wept
and
was
still
weeping
though
his
eyes
were
closed
he
touched
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
the
boy
shrunk
from
his
touch
but
did
not
awake
he
pulled
him
harder
and
asked
him
if
he
was
sleeping
do
they
waken
folk
in
your
country
to
know
whether
they
are
asleep
or
no
said
the
boy
in
a
peevish
tone
no
my
young
sir
answered
nigel
but
when
they
weep
in
the
manner
you
do
in
your
sleep
they
awaken
them
to
see
what
ails
it
signifies
little
to
any
one
what
ails
me
said
the
boy
true
replied
lord
glenvarloch
but
you
knew
before
you
went
to
sleep
how
little
i
could
assist
you
in
your
difficulties
and
you
seemed
disposed
notwithstanding
to
put
some
confidence
in
if
i
did
i
have
changed
my
mind
said
the
lad
and
what
may
have
occasioned
this
change
of
mind
i
trow
said
lord
glenvarloch
some
men
speak
through
their
sleep
perhaps
you
have
the
gift
of
hearing
in
it
no
but
the
patriarch
joseph
never
dreamt
truer
dreams
than
i
indeed
said
lord
glenvarloch
and
pray
what
dream
have
you
had
that
has
deprived
me
of
your
good
opinion
for
that
i
think
seems
the
moral
of
the
matter
you
shall
judge
yourself
answered
the
boy
i
dreamed
i
was
in
a
wild
forest
where
there
was
a
cry
of
hounds
and
winding
of
horns
exactly
as
i
heard
in
greenwich
that
was
because
you
were
in
the
park
this
morning
you
simple
child
said
nigel
stay
my
lord
said
the
youth
i
went
on
in
my
dream
till
at
the
top
of
a
broad
green
alley
i
saw
a
noble
stag
which
had
fallen
into
the
toils
and
methought
i
knew
that
he
was
the
very
stag
which
the
whole
party
were
hunting
and
that
if
the
chase
came
up
the
dogs
would
tear
him
to
pieces
or
the
hunters
would
cut
his
throat
and
i
had
pity
on
the
gallant
stag
and
though
i
was
of
a
different
kind
from
him
and
though
i
was
somewhat
afraid
of
him
i
thought
i
would
venture
something
to
free
so
stately
a
creature
and
i
pulled
out
my
knife
and
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
cut
the
meshes
of
the
net
the
animal
started
up
in
my
face
in
the
likeness
of
a
tiger
much
larger
and
fiercer
than
any
you
may
have
seen
in
the
ward
of
the
wild
beasts
yonder
and
was
just
about
to
tear
me
limb
from
limb
when
you
awaked
methinks
said
nigel
i
deserve
more
thanks
than
i
have
got
for
rescuing
you
from
such
a
danger
by
waking
you
but
my
pretty
master
methinks
all
this
tale
of
a
tiger
and
a
stag
has
little
to
do
with
your
change
of
temper
towards
i
know
not
whether
it
has
or
no
said
the
lad
but
i
will
not
tell
you
who
i
you
will
keep
your
secret
to
yourself
then
peevish
boy
said
nigel
turning
from
him
and
resuming
his
walk
through
the
room
then
stopping
suddenly
he
said
and
yet
you
shall
not
escape
from
me
without
knowing
that
i
penetrate
your
my
mystery
said
the
youth
at
once
alarmed
and
irritated
what
mean
you
my
lord
only
that
i
can
read
your
dream
without
the
assistance
of
a
chaldean
interpreter
and
my
exposition
is
that
my
fair
companion
does
not
wear
the
dress
of
her
and
if
i
do
not
my
lord
said
his
companion
hastily
starting
up
and
folding
her
cloak
tight
around
her
my
dress
such
as
it
is
covers
one
who
will
not
disgrace
many
would
call
that
speech
a
fair
challenge
said
lord
glenvarloch
looking
on
her
fixedly
women
do
not
masquerade
in
men
clothes
to
make
use
of
men
i
have
no
such
purpose
said
the
seeming
boy
i
have
other
means
of
protection
and
powerful
but
i
would
first
know
what
is
an
honourable
and
a
most
respectful
one
said
lord
glenvarloch
whatever
you
are
whatever
motive
may
have
brought
you
into
this
ambiguous
situation
i
am
sensible
every
look
word
and
action
of
yours
makes
me
sensible
that
you
are
no
proper
subject
of
importunity
far
less
of
ill
usage
what
circumstances
can
have
forced
you
into
so
doubtful
a
situation
i
know
not
but
i
feel
assured
there
is
and
can
be
nothing
in
them
of
premeditated
wrong
which
should
expose
you
to
insult
from
me
you
have
nothing
to
i
expected
nothing
less
from
your
nobleness
my
lord
answered
the
female
my
adventure
though
i
feel
it
was
both
desperate
and
foolish
is
not
so
very
foolish
nor
my
safety
here
so
utterly
unprotected
as
at
first
sight
and
in
this
strange
dress
it
may
appear
to
be
i
have
suffered
enough
and
more
than
enough
by
the
degradation
of
having
been
seen
in
this
unfeminine
attire
and
the
comments
you
must
necessarily
have
made
on
my
conduct
but
i
thank
god
that
i
am
so
far
protected
that
i
could
not
have
been
subjected
to
insult
when
this
extraordinary
explanation
had
proceeded
thus
far
the
warder
appeared
to
place
before
lord
glenvarloch
a
meal
which
for
his
present
situation
might
be
called
comfortable
and
which
if
not
equal
to
the
cookery
of
the
celebrated
chevalier
beaujeu
was
much
superior
in
neatness
and
cleanliness
to
that
of
alsatia
a
warder
attended
to
do
the
honours
of
the
table
and
made
a
sign
to
the
disguised
female
to
rise
and
assist
him
in
his
functions
but
nigel
declaring
that
he
knew
the
youth
parents
interfered
and
caused
his
companion
to
eat
along
with
him
she
consented
with
a
sort
of
embarrassment
which
rendered
her
pretty
features
yet
more
interesting
yet
she
maintained
with
a
natural
grace
that
sort
of
which
belongs
to
the
table
and
it
seemed
to
nigel
whether
already
prejudiced
in
her
favour
by
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
their
meeting
or
whether
really
judging
from
what
was
actually
the
fact
that
he
had
seldom
seen
a
young
person
comport
herself
with
more
decorous
propriety
mixed
with
ingenuous
simplicity
while
the
consciousness
of
the
peculiarity
of
her
situation
threw
a
singular
colouring
over
her
whole
demeanour
which
could
be
neither
said
to
be
formal
nor
easy
nor
embarrassed
but
was
compounded
of
and
shaded
with
an
interchange
of
all
these
three
characteristics
wine
was
placed
on
the
table
of
which
she
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
taste
a
glass
their
conversation
was
of
course
limited
by
the
presence
of
the
warder
to
the
business
of
the
table
but
nigel
had
long
ere
the
cloth
was
removed
formed
the
resolution
if
possible
of
making
himself
master
of
this
young
person
history
the
more
especially
as
he
now
began
to
think
that
the
tones
of
her
voice
and
her
features
were
not
so
strange
to
him
as
he
had
originally
supposed
this
however
was
a
conviction
which
he
adopted
slowly
and
only
as
it
dawned
upon
him
from
particular
circumstances
during
the
course
of
the
repast
at
length
the
was
finished
and
lord
glenvarloch
began
to
think
how
he
might
most
easily
enter
upon
the
topic
he
meditated
when
the
warder
announced
a
visitor
soh
said
nigel
something
displeased
i
find
even
a
prison
does
not
save
one
from
importunate
he
prepared
to
receive
his
guest
however
while
his
alarmed
companion
flew
to
the
large
chair
which
had
first
served
her
as
a
place
of
refuge
drew
her
cloak
around
her
and
disposed
herself
as
much
as
she
could
to
avoid
observation
she
had
scarce
made
her
arrangements
for
that
purpose
when
the
door
opened
and
the
worthy
citizen
george
heriot
entered
the
he
cast
around
the
apartment
his
usual
sharp
quick
glance
of
observation
and
advancing
to
nigel
said
my
lord
i
wish
i
could
say
i
was
happy
to
see
the
sight
of
those
who
are
unhappy
themselves
master
heriot
seldom
produces
happiness
to
their
friends
i
however
am
glad
to
see
he
extended
his
hand
but
heriot
bowed
with
much
formal
complaisance
instead
of
accepting
the
courtesy
which
in
those
times
when
the
distinction
of
ranks
was
much
guarded
by
etiquette
and
ceremony
was
considered
as
a
distinguished
favour
you
are
displeased
with
me
master
heriot
said
lord
glenvarloch
reddening
for
he
was
not
deceived
by
the
worthy
citizen
affectation
of
extreme
reverence
and
respect
by
no
means
my
lord
replied
heriot
but
i
have
been
in
france
and
have
thought
it
is
well
to
import
along
with
other
more
substantial
articles
a
small
sample
of
that
which
the
french
are
so
renowned
it
is
not
kind
of
you
said
nigel
to
bestow
the
first
use
of
it
on
an
old
and
obliged
heriot
only
answered
to
this
observation
with
a
short
dry
cough
and
then
proceeded
hem
hem
i
say
ahem
my
lord
as
my
french
politeness
may
not
carry
me
far
i
would
willingly
know
whether
i
am
to
speak
as
a
friend
since
your
lordship
is
pleased
to
term
me
such
or
whether
i
am
as
befits
my
condition
to
confine
myself
to
the
needful
business
which
must
be
treated
of
between
speak
as
a
friend
by
all
means
master
heriot
said
nigel
i
perceive
you
have
adopted
some
of
the
numerous
prejudices
against
me
if
not
all
of
them
speak
out
and
frankly
what
i
can
not
deny
i
will
at
least
and
i
trust
my
lord
redress
said
heriot
so
far
as
in
my
power
certainly
answered
nigel
ah
i
my
lord
continued
heriot
that
is
a
melancholy
though
a
necessary
restriction
for
how
lightly
may
any
one
do
an
hundred
times
more
than
the
degree
of
evil
which
it
may
be
within
his
power
to
repair
to
the
sufferers
and
to
society
but
we
are
not
alone
here
he
said
stopping
and
darting
his
shrewd
eye
towards
the
muffled
figure
of
the
disguised
maiden
whose
utmost
efforts
had
not
enabled
her
so
to
adjust
her
position
as
altogether
to
escape
observation
more
anxious
to
prevent
her
being
discovered
than
to
keep
his
own
affairs
private
nigel
hastily
answered
is
a
page
of
mine
you
may
speak
freely
before
him
he
is
of
france
and
knows
no
i
am
then
to
speak
freely
said
heriot
after
a
second
glance
at
the
chair
perhaps
my
words
may
be
more
free
than
go
on
sir
said
nigel
i
have
told
you
i
can
bear
in
one
word
then
my
lord
why
do
i
find
you
in
this
place
and
whelmed
with
charges
which
must
blacken
a
name
rendered
famous
by
ages
of
virtue
simply
then
you
find
me
here
said
nigel
because
to
begin
from
my
original
error
i
would
be
wiser
than
my
it
was
a
difficult
task
my
lord
replied
heriot
your
father
was
voiced
generally
as
the
wisest
and
one
of
the
bravest
men
of
he
commanded
me
continued
nigel
to
avoid
all
gambling
and
i
took
upon
me
to
modify
this
injunction
into
regulating
my
play
according
to
my
skill
means
and
the
course
of
my
ay
self
opinion
acting
on
a
desire
of
acquisition
my
lord
you
hoped
to
touch
pitch
and
not
to
be
defiled
answered
heriot
well
my
lord
you
need
not
say
for
i
have
heard
with
much
regret
how
far
this
conduct
diminished
your
reputation
your
next
error
i
may
without
scruple
remind
you
of
my
lord
my
lord
in
whatever
degree
lord
dalgarno
may
have
failed
towards
you
the
son
of
his
father
should
have
been
sacred
from
your
you
speak
in
cold
blood
master
heriot
and
i
was
smarting
under
a
thousand
wrongs
inflicted
on
me
under
the
mask
of
that
is
he
gave
your
lordship
bad
advice
and
you
said
heriot
was
fool
enough
to
follow
his
counsel
answered
nigel
but
we
will
pass
this
master
heriot
if
you
please
old
men
and
young
men
men
of
the
sword
and
men
of
peaceful
occupation
always
have
thought
always
will
think
differently
on
such
i
grant
answered
heriot
the
distinction
between
the
old
goldsmith
and
the
young
nobleman
still
you
should
have
had
patience
for
lord
huntinglen
sake
and
prudence
for
your
own
supposing
your
quarrel
just
i
pray
you
to
pass
on
to
some
other
charge
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
am
not
your
accuser
my
lord
but
i
trust
in
heaven
that
your
own
heart
has
already
accused
you
bitterly
on
the
inhospitable
wrong
which
your
late
landlord
has
sustained
at
your
had
i
been
guilty
of
what
you
allude
to
said
lord
glenvarloch
had
a
moment
of
temptation
hurried
me
away
i
had
long
ere
now
most
bitterly
repented
it
but
whoever
may
have
wronged
the
unhappy
woman
it
was
not
i
i
never
heard
of
her
folly
until
within
this
come
my
lord
said
heriot
with
some
severity
this
sounds
too
much
like
affectation
i
know
there
is
among
our
modern
youth
a
new
creed
respecting
adultery
as
well
as
homicide
i
would
rather
hear
you
speak
of
a
revision
of
the
decalogue
with
mitigated
penalties
in
favour
of
the
privileged
orders
i
would
rather
hear
you
do
this
than
deny
a
fact
in
which
you
have
been
known
to
glory
i
never
did
never
would
have
taken
honour
to
myself
from
such
a
cause
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
could
not
prevent
other
idle
tongues
and
idle
brains
from
making
false
you
would
have
known
well
enough
how
to
stop
their
mouths
my
lord
replied
heriot
had
they
spoke
of
you
what
was
unpleasing
to
your
ears
and
what
the
truth
did
not
come
my
lord
remember
your
promise
to
confess
and
indeed
to
confess
is
in
this
case
in
some
slight
sort
to
redress
i
will
grant
you
are
young
the
woman
handsome
and
as
i
myself
have
observed
enough
let
me
know
where
she
is
her
foolish
husband
has
still
some
compassion
for
her
will
save
her
from
infamy
perhaps
in
time
receive
her
back
for
we
are
a
generation
we
traders
do
not
my
lord
emulate
those
who
work
mischief
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
it
is
the
very
devil
worst
your
grave
remonstrances
will
drive
me
mad
said
nigel
there
is
a
show
of
sense
and
reason
in
what
you
say
and
yet
it
is
positively
insisting
on
my
telling
the
retreat
of
a
fugitive
of
whom
i
know
nothing
it
is
well
my
lord
answered
heriot
coldly
you
have
a
right
such
as
it
is
to
keep
your
own
secrets
but
since
my
discourse
on
these
points
seems
so
totally
unavailing
we
had
better
proceed
to
business
yet
your
father
image
rises
before
me
and
seems
to
plead
that
i
should
go
be
it
as
you
will
sir
said
glenvarloch
he
who
doubts
my
word
shall
have
no
additional
security
for
well
my
in
the
sanctuary
at
whitefriars
a
place
of
refuge
so
unsuitable
to
a
young
man
of
quality
and
character
i
am
told
a
murder
was
and
you
believe
that
i
did
the
deed
i
suppose
god
forbid
my
lord
said
heriot
the
coroner
inquest
hath
sat
and
it
appeared
that
your
lordship
under
your
assumed
name
of
grahame
behaved
with
the
utmost
no
compliment
i
pray
you
said
nigel
i
am
only
too
happy
to
find
that
i
did
not
murder
or
am
not
believed
to
have
murdered
the
old
true
my
lord
said
heriot
but
even
in
this
affair
there
lacks
explanation
your
lordship
embarked
this
morning
in
a
wherry
with
a
female
and
it
is
said
an
immense
sum
of
money
in
specie
and
other
valuables
but
the
woman
has
not
since
been
heard
i
parted
with
her
at
paul
wharf
said
nigel
where
she
went
ashore
with
her
charge
i
gave
her
a
letter
to
that
very
man
john
ay
that
is
the
waterman
story
but
john
christie
denies
that
he
remembers
anything
of
the
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
said
the
young
nobleman
i
hope
in
heaven
she
has
not
been
trepanned
for
the
treasure
she
had
with
i
hope
not
my
lord
replied
heriot
but
men
minds
are
much
disturbed
about
it
our
national
character
suffers
on
all
hands
men
remember
the
fatal
case
of
lord
sanquhar
hanged
for
the
murder
of
a
and
exclaim
they
will
not
have
their
wives
whored
and
their
property
stolen
by
the
nobility
of
and
all
this
is
laid
to
my
door
said
nigel
my
exculpation
is
i
trust
so
my
lord
said
heriot
nay
in
this
particular
i
do
not
doubt
but
why
did
you
leave
whitefriars
under
such
circumstances
master
reginald
lowestoffe
sent
a
boat
for
me
with
intimation
to
provide
for
my
i
am
sorry
to
say
replied
heriot
that
he
denies
all
knowledge
of
your
lordship
motions
after
having
dispatched
a
messenger
to
you
with
some
the
watermen
told
me
they
were
employed
by
watermen
said
heriot
one
of
these
proves
to
be
an
idle
apprentice
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
the
other
has
escaped
but
the
fellow
who
is
in
custody
persists
in
saying
he
was
employed
by
your
lordship
and
you
he
lies
said
lord
glenvarloch
hastily
he
told
me
master
lowestoffe
had
sent
i
hope
that
gentleman
is
at
liberty
he
is
answered
heriot
and
has
escaped
with
a
rebuke
from
the
benchers
for
interfering
in
such
a
matter
as
your
lordship
the
court
desire
to
keep
well
with
the
young
templars
in
these
times
of
commotion
or
he
had
not
come
off
so
that
is
the
only
word
of
comfort
i
have
heard
from
you
replied
nigel
but
this
poor
woman
she
and
her
trunk
were
committed
to
the
charge
of
two
so
said
the
pretended
waterman
but
none
of
the
fellows
who
ply
at
the
wharf
will
acknowledge
the
i
see
the
idea
makes
you
uneasy
my
lord
but
every
effort
is
made
to
discover
the
poor
woman
place
of
retreat
if
indeed
she
yet
and
now
my
lord
my
errand
is
spoken
so
far
as
it
relates
exclusively
to
your
lordship
what
remains
is
matter
of
business
of
a
more
formal
let
us
proceed
to
it
without
delay
said
lord
glenvarloch
i
would
hear
of
the
affairs
of
any
one
rather
than
of
my
you
can
not
have
forgotten
my
lord
said
heriot
the
transaction
which
took
place
some
weeks
since
at
lord
huntinglen
by
which
a
large
sum
of
money
was
advanced
for
the
redemption
of
your
lordship
estate
i
remember
it
perfectly
said
nigel
and
your
present
austerity
can
not
make
me
forget
your
kindness
on
the
heriot
bowed
gravely
and
went
that
money
was
advanced
under
the
expectation
and
hope
that
it
might
be
replaced
by
the
contents
of
a
grant
to
your
lordship
under
the
royal
in
payment
of
certain
monies
due
by
the
crown
to
your
i
trust
your
lordship
understood
the
transaction
at
the
time
i
trust
you
now
understand
my
resumption
of
its
import
and
hold
it
to
be
correct
undeniably
correct
answered
lord
glenvarloch
if
the
sums
contained
in
the
warrant
can
not
be
recovered
my
lands
become
the
property
of
those
who
paid
off
the
original
holders
of
the
mortgage
and
now
stand
in
their
even
so
my
lord
said
heriot
and
your
lordship
unhappy
circumstances
having
it
would
seem
alarmed
these
creditors
they
are
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
pressing
for
one
or
other
of
these
alternatives
possession
of
the
land
or
payment
of
their
they
have
a
right
to
one
or
other
answered
lord
glenvarloch
and
as
i
can
not
do
the
last
in
my
present
condition
i
suppose
they
must
enter
on
stay
my
lord
replied
heriot
if
you
have
ceased
to
call
me
a
friend
to
your
person
at
least
you
shall
see
i
am
willing
to
be
such
to
your
father
house
were
it
but
for
the
sake
of
your
father
memory
if
you
will
trust
me
with
the
warrant
under
the
i
believe
circumstances
do
now
so
stand
at
court
that
i
may
be
able
to
recover
the
money
for
i
would
do
so
gladly
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
the
casket
which
contains
it
is
not
in
my
possession
it
was
seized
when
i
was
arrested
at
it
will
be
no
longer
withheld
from
you
said
heriot
for
i
understand
my
master
natural
good
sense
and
some
information
which
he
has
procured
i
know
not
how
has
induced
him
to
contradict
the
whole
charge
of
the
attempt
on
his
person
it
is
entirely
hushed
up
and
you
will
only
be
proceeded
against
for
your
violence
on
lord
dalgarno
committed
within
the
verge
of
the
palace
and
that
you
will
find
heavy
enough
to
i
will
not
shrink
under
the
weight
said
lord
glenvarloch
but
that
is
not
the
present
if
i
had
that
casket
your
baggage
stood
in
the
little
as
i
passed
said
the
citizen
the
casket
caught
my
eye
i
think
you
had
it
of
me
it
was
my
old
friend
sir
faithful
frugal
ay
he
too
had
a
son
here
he
stopped
short
a
son
who
like
lord
glenvarloch
did
no
credit
to
his
was
it
not
so
you
would
have
ended
the
sentence
master
heriot
asked
the
young
nobleman
my
lord
it
was
a
word
spoken
rashly
answered
heriot
god
may
mend
all
in
his
own
good
time
this
however
i
will
say
that
i
have
sometimes
envied
my
friends
their
fair
and
flourishing
families
and
yet
have
i
seen
such
changes
when
death
has
removed
the
head
so
many
rich
men
sons
penniless
the
heirs
of
so
many
knights
and
nobles
acreless
that
i
think
mine
own
estate
and
memory
as
i
shall
order
it
has
a
fair
chance
of
outliving
those
of
greater
men
though
god
has
given
me
no
heir
of
my
name
but
this
is
from
the
ho
warder
bring
in
lord
glenvarloch
the
officer
obeyed
seals
had
been
placed
upon
the
trunk
and
casket
but
were
now
removed
the
warder
said
in
consequence
of
the
subsequent
orders
from
court
and
the
whole
was
placed
at
the
prisoner
free
disposal
desirous
to
bring
this
painful
visit
to
a
conclusion
lord
glenvarloch
opened
the
casket
and
looked
through
the
papers
which
it
contained
first
hastily
and
then
more
slowly
and
accurately
but
it
was
all
in
vain
the
sovereign
signed
warrant
had
disappeared
i
thought
and
expected
nothing
better
said
george
heriot
bitterly
the
beginning
of
evil
is
the
letting
out
of
water
here
is
a
fair
heritage
lost
i
dare
say
on
a
foul
cast
at
dice
or
a
conjuring
trick
at
cards
my
lord
your
surprise
is
well
played
i
give
you
full
joy
of
your
accomplishments
i
have
seen
many
as
young
brawlers
and
spendthrifts
but
never
as
young
and
accomplished
a
nay
man
never
bend
your
angry
brows
on
me
i
speak
in
bitterness
of
heart
from
what
i
remember
of
your
worthy
father
and
if
his
son
hears
of
his
degeneracy
from
no
one
else
he
shall
hear
it
from
the
old
this
new
suspicion
drove
nigel
to
the
very
extremity
of
his
patience
yet
the
motives
and
zeal
of
the
good
old
man
as
well
as
the
circumstances
of
suspicion
which
created
his
displeasure
were
so
excellent
an
excuse
for
it
that
they
formed
an
absolute
curb
on
the
resentment
of
lord
glenvarloch
and
constrained
him
after
two
or
three
hasty
exclamations
to
observe
a
proud
and
sullen
silence
at
length
master
heriot
resumed
his
lecture
hark
you
my
lord
he
said
it
is
scarce
possible
that
this
most
important
paper
can
be
absolutely
assigned
away
let
me
know
in
what
obscure
corner
and
for
what
petty
sum
it
lies
pledged
something
may
yet
be
your
efforts
in
my
favour
are
the
more
generous
said
lord
glenvarloch
as
you
offer
them
to
one
whom
you
believe
you
have
cause
to
think
hardly
of
but
they
are
altogether
unavailing
fortune
has
taken
the
field
against
me
at
every
point
even
let
her
win
the
zouns
exclaimed
heriot
impatiently
you
would
make
a
saint
swear
why
i
tell
you
if
this
paper
the
loss
of
which
seems
to
sit
so
light
on
you
be
not
found
farewell
to
the
fair
lordship
of
glenvarloch
firth
and
forest
lea
and
furrow
lake
and
stream
all
that
has
been
in
the
house
of
olifaunt
since
the
days
of
william
the
lion
farewell
to
them
then
said
nigel
and
that
moan
is
soon
my
lord
you
will
make
more
moan
for
it
ere
you
die
said
heriot
in
the
same
tone
of
angry
impatience
not
i
my
old
friend
said
nigel
if
i
mourn
master
heriot
it
will
be
for
having
lost
the
good
opinion
of
a
worthy
man
and
lost
it
as
i
must
say
most
ay
ay
young
man
said
heriot
shaking
his
head
make
me
believe
that
if
you
to
sum
the
matter
up
he
said
rising
from
his
seat
and
walking
towards
that
occupied
by
the
disguised
female
for
our
matters
are
now
drawn
into
small
compass
you
shall
as
soon
make
me
believe
that
this
masquerading
mummer
on
whom
i
now
lay
the
hand
of
paternal
authority
is
a
french
page
who
understands
no
so
saying
he
took
hold
of
the
supposed
page
cloak
and
not
without
some
gentle
degree
of
violence
led
into
the
middle
of
the
apartment
the
disguised
fair
one
who
in
vain
attempted
to
cover
her
face
first
with
her
mantle
and
afterwards
with
her
hands
both
which
impediments
master
heriot
removed
something
unceremoniously
and
gave
to
view
the
detected
daughter
of
the
old
chronologist
his
own
fair
margaret
ramsay
here
is
goodly
gear
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
he
could
not
prevent
himself
from
giving
her
a
slight
shake
for
we
have
elsewhere
noticed
that
he
was
a
severe
how
comes
it
minion
that
i
find
you
in
so
shameless
a
dress
and
so
unworthy
a
situation
nay
your
modesty
is
now
mistimed
it
should
have
come
sooner
speak
or
i
will
master
heriot
said
lord
glenvarloch
whatever
right
you
may
have
over
this
maiden
elsewhere
while
in
my
apartment
she
is
under
my
your
protection
my
lord
a
proper
protector
and
how
long
mistress
have
you
been
under
my
lord
protection
speak
out
forsooth
for
the
matter
of
two
hours
godfather
answered
the
maiden
with
a
countenance
bent
to
the
ground
and
covered
with
blushes
but
it
was
against
my
two
hours
repeated
heriot
space
enough
for
my
lord
this
is
i
suppose
another
victim
offered
to
your
character
of
gallantry
another
adventure
to
be
boasted
of
at
beaujeu
ordinary
methinks
the
roof
under
which
you
first
met
this
silly
maiden
should
have
secured
at
least
from
such
a
on
my
honour
master
heriot
said
lord
glenvarloch
you
remind
me
now
for
the
first
time
that
i
saw
this
young
lady
in
your
family
her
features
are
not
easily
forgotten
and
yet
i
was
trying
in
vain
to
recollect
where
i
had
last
looked
on
them
for
your
suspicions
they
are
as
false
as
they
are
injurious
both
to
her
and
me
i
had
but
discovered
her
disguise
as
you
entered
i
am
satisfied
from
her
whole
behaviour
that
her
presence
here
in
this
dress
was
involuntary
and
god
forbid
that
i
have
been
capable
of
taking
advantage
of
it
to
her
it
is
well
mouthed
my
lord
said
master
heriot
but
a
cunning
clerk
can
read
the
apocrypha
as
loud
as
the
scripture
frankly
my
lord
you
are
come
to
that
pass
where
your
words
will
not
be
received
without
a
i
should
not
speak
perhaps
said
margaret
the
natural
vivacity
of
whose
temper
could
never
be
long
suppressed
by
any
situation
however
disadvantageous
but
i
can
not
be
silent
godfather
you
do
me
wrong
and
no
less
wrong
to
this
young
nobleman
you
say
his
words
want
a
warrant
i
know
where
to
find
a
warrant
for
some
of
them
and
the
rest
i
deeply
and
devoutly
believe
without
and
i
thank
you
maiden
replied
nigel
for
the
good
opinion
you
have
expressed
i
am
at
that
point
it
seems
though
how
i
have
been
driven
to
it
i
know
not
where
every
fair
construction
of
my
actions
and
motives
is
refused
me
i
am
the
more
obliged
to
her
who
grants
me
that
right
which
the
world
denies
me
for
you
lady
were
i
at
liberty
i
have
a
sword
and
arm
should
know
how
to
guard
your
upon
my
word
a
perfect
amadis
and
oriana
said
george
heriot
i
should
soon
get
my
throat
cut
betwixt
the
knight
and
the
princess
i
suppose
but
that
the
are
happily
within
come
come
lady
if
you
mean
to
make
your
way
with
me
it
must
be
by
plain
facts
not
by
speeches
from
romaunts
and
how
in
heaven
name
came
you
here
sir
answered
margaret
since
i
must
speak
i
went
to
greenwich
this
morning
with
monna
paula
to
present
a
petition
to
the
king
on
the
part
of
the
lady
exclaimed
heriot
is
she
in
the
dance
too
could
she
not
have
waited
my
return
to
stir
in
her
affairs
but
i
suppose
the
intelligence
i
sent
her
had
rendered
her
restless
ah
woman
woman
he
that
goes
partner
with
you
had
need
of
a
double
share
of
patience
for
you
will
bring
none
into
the
common
well
but
what
on
earth
had
this
embassy
of
monna
paula
to
do
with
your
absurd
disguise
speak
monna
paula
was
frightened
answered
margaret
and
did
not
know
how
to
set
about
the
errand
for
you
know
she
scarce
ever
goes
out
of
doors
and
so
and
so
i
agreed
to
go
with
her
to
give
her
courage
and
for
the
dress
i
am
sure
you
remember
i
wore
it
at
a
christmas
mumming
and
you
thought
it
not
yes
for
a
christmas
parlour
said
heriot
but
not
to
go
through
the
country
in
i
do
remember
it
minion
and
i
knew
it
even
now
that
and
your
little
shoe
there
linked
with
a
hint
i
had
in
the
morning
from
a
friend
or
one
who
called
himself
such
led
to
your
here
lord
glenvarloch
could
not
help
giving
a
glance
at
the
pretty
foot
which
even
the
staid
citizen
thought
worth
recollection
it
was
but
a
glance
for
he
saw
how
much
the
least
degree
of
observation
added
to
margaret
distress
and
confusion
and
tell
me
maiden
continued
master
heriot
for
what
we
have
observed
was
did
the
lady
hermione
know
of
this
fair
work
i
dared
not
have
told
her
for
the
world
said
margaret
she
thought
one
of
our
apprentices
went
with
monna
it
may
be
here
noticed
that
the
words
our
apprentices
seemed
to
have
in
them
something
of
a
charm
to
break
the
fascination
with
which
lord
glenvarloch
had
hitherto
listened
to
the
broken
yet
interesting
details
of
margaret
history
and
wherefore
went
he
not
he
had
been
a
fitter
companion
for
monna
paula
than
you
i
wot
said
the
citizen
he
was
otherwise
employed
said
margaret
in
a
voice
scarce
audible
master
george
darted
a
hasty
glance
at
nigel
and
when
he
saw
his
features
betoken
no
consciousness
he
muttered
to
himself
it
must
be
better
than
i
and
so
this
cursed
spaniard
with
her
head
full
as
they
all
have
of
disguises
and
masks
was
jade
and
fool
enough
to
take
you
with
her
on
this
wild
goose
errand
and
how
sped
you
i
pray
just
as
we
reached
the
gate
of
the
park
replied
margaret
the
cry
of
treason
was
raised
i
know
not
what
became
of
monna
but
i
ran
till
i
fell
into
the
arms
of
a
very
decent
called
linklater
and
i
was
fain
to
tell
him
i
was
your
and
so
he
kept
the
rest
of
them
from
me
and
got
me
to
speech
of
his
majesty
as
i
entreated
him
to
it
is
the
only
sign
you
showed
in
the
whole
matter
that
common
sense
had
not
utterly
deserted
your
little
skull
said
heriot
his
majesty
continued
the
damsel
was
so
gracious
as
to
receive
me
alone
though
the
courtiers
cried
out
against
the
danger
to
his
person
and
would
have
searched
me
for
arms
god
help
me
but
the
king
forbade
it
i
fancy
he
had
a
hint
from
linklater
how
the
truth
stood
with
well
maiden
i
ask
not
what
passed
said
heriot
it
becomes
not
me
to
pry
into
my
master
secrets
had
you
been
closeted
with
his
grandfather
the
red
tod
of
saint
andrews
as
davie
lindsay
used
to
call
him
by
my
faith
i
should
have
had
my
own
thoughts
of
the
matter
but
our
master
god
bless
him
is
douce
and
temperate
and
solomon
in
every
thing
save
in
the
chapter
of
wives
and
i
know
not
what
you
mean
sir
answered
margaret
his
majesty
was
most
kind
and
compassionate
but
said
i
must
be
sent
hither
and
that
the
lieutenant
lady
the
lady
mansel
would
have
a
charge
of
me
and
see
that
i
sustained
no
wrong
and
the
king
promised
to
send
me
in
a
tilted
barge
and
under
conduct
of
a
person
well
known
to
you
and
thus
i
come
to
be
in
the
but
how
or
why
in
this
apartment
nymph
said
george
heriot
expound
that
to
me
for
i
think
the
riddle
needs
i
can
not
explain
it
sir
further
than
that
the
lady
mansel
sent
me
here
in
spite
of
my
earnest
prayers
tears
and
entreaties
i
was
not
afraid
of
any
thing
for
i
knew
i
should
be
protected
but
i
could
have
died
then
could
die
now
for
very
shame
and
confusion
well
well
if
your
tears
are
genuine
said
heriot
they
may
the
sooner
wash
out
the
memory
of
your
fault
knows
your
father
aught
of
this
escape
of
yours
i
would
not
for
the
world
he
did
replied
she
he
believes
me
with
the
lady
ay
honest
davy
can
regulate
his
horologes
better
than
his
come
damsel
now
i
will
escort
you
back
to
the
lady
mansel
and
pray
her
of
her
kindness
that
when
she
is
again
trusted
with
a
goose
she
will
not
give
it
to
the
fox
to
the
warders
will
let
us
pass
to
my
lady
lodgings
i
stay
but
one
moment
said
lord
glenvarloch
whatever
hard
opinion
you
may
have
formed
of
me
i
forgive
you
for
time
will
show
that
you
do
me
wrong
and
you
yourself
i
think
will
be
the
first
to
regret
the
injustice
you
have
done
me
but
involve
not
in
your
suspicions
this
young
person
for
whose
purity
of
thought
angels
themselves
should
be
vouchers
i
have
marked
every
look
every
gesture
and
whilst
i
can
draw
breath
i
shall
ever
think
of
her
with
think
not
at
all
of
her
my
lord
answered
george
heriot
interrupting
him
it
is
i
have
a
notion
the
best
favour
you
can
do
her
or
think
of
her
as
the
daughter
of
davy
ramsay
the
clockmaker
no
proper
subject
for
fine
speeches
romantic
adventures
or
arcadian
compliments
i
give
you
my
lord
i
think
not
altogether
so
harshly
as
my
speech
may
have
spoken
if
i
can
help
that
is
if
i
saw
my
way
clearly
through
this
labyrinth
but
it
avails
not
talking
now
i
give
your
lordship
here
warder
permit
us
to
pass
to
the
lady
hansel
the
warder
said
he
must
have
orders
from
the
lieutenant
and
as
he
retired
to
procure
them
the
parties
remained
standing
near
each
other
but
without
speaking
and
scarce
looking
at
each
other
save
by
stealth
a
situation
which
in
two
of
the
party
at
least
was
sufficiently
embarrassing
the
difference
of
rank
though
in
that
age
a
consideration
so
serious
could
not
prevent
lord
glenvarloch
from
seeing
that
margaret
ramsay
was
one
of
the
prettiest
young
women
he
had
ever
beheld
from
suspecting
he
could
scarce
tell
why
that
he
himself
was
not
indifferent
to
her
from
feeling
assured
that
he
had
been
the
cause
of
much
of
her
present
distress
admiration
and
generosity
acting
in
favour
of
the
same
object
and
when
the
yeoman
returned
with
permission
to
his
guests
to
withdraw
nigel
obeisance
to
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
mechanic
was
marked
with
an
expression
which
called
up
in
her
cheeks
as
much
colour
as
any
incident
of
the
eventful
day
had
hitherto
excited
she
returned
the
courtesy
timidly
and
irresolutely
clung
to
her
godfather
arm
and
left
the
apartment
which
dark
as
it
was
had
never
yet
appeared
so
obscure
to
nigel
as
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
chapter
xxx
yet
though
thou
shouldst
be
dragg
in
scorn
to
yonder
ignominious
tree
thou
shall
not
want
one
faithful
friend
to
share
the
cruel
fates
decree
of
jemmy
master
george
heriot
and
his
ward
as
she
might
justly
be
termed
for
his
affection
to
margaret
imposed
on
him
all
the
cares
of
a
guardian
were
ushered
by
the
yeoman
of
the
guard
to
the
lodging
of
the
lieutenant
where
they
found
him
seated
with
his
lady
they
were
received
by
both
with
that
decorous
civility
which
master
character
and
supposed
influence
demanded
even
at
the
hand
of
a
punctilious
old
soldier
and
courtier
like
sir
edward
mansel
lady
mansel
received
margaret
with
like
courtesy
and
informed
master
george
that
she
was
now
only
her
guest
and
no
longer
her
prisoner
she
is
at
liberty
she
said
to
return
to
her
friends
under
your
charge
such
is
his
majesty
i
am
glad
of
it
madam
answered
heriot
but
only
i
could
have
wished
her
freedom
had
taken
place
before
her
foolish
interview
with
that
singular
young
man
and
i
marvel
your
ladyship
permitted
my
good
master
heriot
said
sir
edward
we
act
according
to
the
commands
of
one
better
and
wiser
than
ourselves
our
orders
from
his
majesty
must
be
strictly
and
literally
obeyed
and
i
need
not
say
that
the
wisdom
of
his
majesty
doth
more
than
ensure
i
know
his
majesty
wisdom
well
said
heriot
yet
there
is
an
old
proverb
about
fire
and
flax
well
let
it
i
see
sir
mungo
malagrowther
stalking
towards
the
door
of
the
lodging
said
the
lady
mansel
with
the
gait
of
a
lame
crane
it
is
his
second
visit
this
he
brought
the
warrant
for
discharging
lord
glenvarloch
of
the
charge
of
treason
said
sir
edward
and
from
him
said
heriot
i
heard
much
of
what
had
befallen
for
i
came
from
france
only
late
last
evening
and
somewhat
as
they
spoke
sir
mungo
entered
the
apartment
saluted
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
and
his
lady
with
ceremonious
civility
honoured
george
heriot
with
a
patronising
nod
of
acknowledgment
and
accosted
margaret
with
hey
my
young
charge
you
have
not
doffed
your
masculine
attire
yet
she
does
not
mean
to
lay
it
aside
sir
mungo
said
heriot
speaking
loud
until
she
has
had
satisfaction
from
you
for
betraying
her
disguise
to
me
like
a
false
knight
and
in
very
deed
sir
mungo
i
think
when
you
told
me
she
was
rambling
about
in
so
strange
a
dress
you
might
have
said
also
that
she
was
under
lady
mansel
that
was
the
king
secret
master
heriot
said
sir
mungo
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
with
an
air
of
atrabilarious
importance
the
other
was
a
hint
to
yourself
as
the
girl
yes
replied
heriot
it
was
done
like
yourself
enough
told
to
make
me
unhappy
about
her
not
a
word
which
could
relieve
my
sir
mungo
will
not
hear
that
remark
said
the
lady
we
must
change
the
is
there
any
news
from
court
sir
mungo
you
have
been
to
greenwich
you
might
as
well
ask
me
madam
answered
the
knight
whether
there
is
any
news
from
how
sir
mungo
how
said
sir
edward
measure
your
words
something
better
you
speak
of
the
court
of
king
sir
edward
if
i
spoke
of
the
court
of
the
twelve
kaisers
i
would
say
it
is
as
confused
for
the
present
as
the
infernal
regions
courtiers
of
forty
years
standing
and
such
i
may
write
myself
are
as
far
to
seek
in
the
matter
as
a
minnow
in
the
maelstrom
some
folk
say
the
king
has
frowned
on
the
prince
some
that
the
prince
has
looked
grave
on
the
duke
some
that
lord
glenvarloch
will
be
hanged
for
high
treason
and
some
that
there
is
matter
against
lord
dalgarno
that
may
cost
him
as
much
as
his
head
and
what
do
you
that
are
a
courtier
of
forty
years
standing
think
of
it
all
said
sir
edward
mansel
nay
nay
do
not
ask
him
sir
edward
said
the
lady
with
an
expressive
look
to
her
husband
sir
mungo
is
too
witty
added
master
heriot
to
remember
that
he
who
says
aught
that
may
be
repeated
to
his
own
prejudice
does
but
load
a
piece
for
any
of
the
company
to
shoot
him
dead
with
at
their
pleasure
and
what
said
the
bold
knight
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
the
trepan
why
now
what
if
i
should
say
that
dalgarno
has
more
wit
than
honesty
the
duke
more
sail
than
ballast
the
prince
more
pride
than
prudence
and
that
the
king
the
lady
mansel
held
up
her
finger
in
a
warning
manner
that
the
king
is
my
very
good
master
who
has
given
me
for
forty
years
and
more
dog
wages
videlicit
bones
and
why
now
all
this
is
said
and
archie
armstrong
footnote
the
celebrated
court
jester
says
worse
than
this
of
the
best
of
them
every
the
more
fool
he
said
george
heriot
yet
he
is
not
so
utterly
wrong
for
folly
is
his
best
wisdom
but
do
not
you
sir
mungo
set
your
wit
against
a
fool
though
he
be
a
court
a
fool
said
you
replied
sir
mungo
not
having
fully
heard
what
master
heriot
said
or
not
choosing
to
have
it
thought
so
i
have
been
a
fool
indeed
to
hang
on
at
a
court
here
when
men
of
understanding
and
men
of
action
have
been
making
fortunes
in
every
other
place
of
europe
but
here
a
man
comes
indifferently
off
unless
he
gets
a
great
key
to
turn
looking
at
sir
edward
or
can
beat
tattoo
with
a
hammer
on
a
pewter
well
sirs
i
must
make
as
much
haste
back
on
mine
errand
as
if
i
were
a
fee
sir
edward
and
my
lady
i
leave
my
commendations
with
you
and
my
with
you
master
heriot
and
for
this
breaker
of
bounds
if
you
will
act
by
my
counsel
some
maceration
by
fasting
and
a
gentle
use
of
the
rod
is
the
best
cure
for
her
giddy
if
you
propose
for
greenwich
sir
mungo
said
the
lieutenant
i
can
spare
you
the
labour
the
king
comes
immediately
to
and
that
must
be
the
reason
the
council
are
summoned
to
meet
in
such
hurry
said
sir
mungo
well
i
will
with
your
permission
go
to
the
poor
lad
glenvarloch
and
bestow
some
comfort
on
the
lieutenant
seemed
to
look
up
and
pause
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
the
lad
will
want
a
pleasant
companion
who
can
tell
him
the
nature
of
the
punishment
which
he
is
to
suffer
and
other
matters
of
concernment
i
will
not
leave
him
until
i
show
him
how
absolutely
he
hath
ruined
himself
from
feather
to
spur
how
deplorable
is
his
present
state
and
how
small
his
chance
of
mending
well
sir
mungo
replied
the
lieutenant
if
you
really
think
all
this
likely
to
be
very
consolatory
to
the
party
concerned
i
will
send
a
warder
to
conduct
and
i
said
george
heriot
will
humbly
pray
of
lady
mansel
that
she
will
lend
some
of
her
handmaiden
apparel
to
this
girl
for
i
shall
forfeit
my
reputation
if
i
walk
up
tower
hill
with
her
in
that
mad
guise
and
yet
the
silly
lassie
looks
not
so
ill
in
it
i
will
send
my
coach
with
you
instantly
said
the
obliging
lady
faith
madam
and
if
you
will
honour
us
by
such
courtesy
i
will
gladly
accept
it
at
your
hands
said
the
citizen
for
business
presses
hard
on
me
and
the
forenoon
is
already
lost
to
little
the
coach
being
ordered
accordingly
transported
the
worthy
citizen
and
his
charge
to
his
mansion
in
lombard
street
there
he
found
his
presence
was
anxiously
expected
by
the
lady
hermione
who
had
just
received
an
order
to
be
in
readiness
to
attend
upon
the
royal
privy
council
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
upon
whom
in
her
inexperience
of
business
and
long
retirement
from
society
and
the
world
the
intimation
had
made
as
deep
an
impression
as
if
it
had
not
been
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
petition
which
she
had
presented
to
the
king
by
monna
paula
george
heriot
gently
blamed
her
for
taking
any
steps
in
an
affair
so
important
until
his
return
from
france
especially
as
he
had
requested
her
to
remain
quiet
in
a
letter
which
accompanied
the
evidence
he
had
transmitted
to
her
from
paris
she
could
only
plead
in
answer
the
influence
which
her
immediately
stirring
in
the
matter
was
likely
to
have
on
the
affair
of
her
kinsman
lord
glenvarloch
for
she
was
ashamed
to
acknowledge
how
much
she
had
been
gained
on
by
the
eager
importunity
of
her
youthful
companion
the
motive
of
margaret
eagerness
was
of
course
the
safety
of
nigel
but
we
must
leave
it
to
time
to
show
in
what
particulars
that
came
to
be
connected
with
the
petition
of
the
lady
hermione
meanwhile
we
return
to
the
visit
with
which
sir
mungo
malagrowther
favoured
the
afflicted
young
nobleman
in
his
place
of
captivity
the
knight
after
the
usual
salutations
and
having
prefaced
his
discourse
with
a
great
deal
of
professed
regret
for
nigel
situation
sat
down
beside
him
and
composing
his
grotesque
features
into
the
most
lugubrious
despondence
began
his
raven
song
as
follows
i
bless
god
my
lord
that
i
was
the
person
who
had
the
pleasure
to
bring
his
majesty
mild
message
to
the
lieutenant
discharging
the
higher
prosecution
against
ye
for
any
thing
meditated
against
his
majesty
sacred
person
for
admit
you
be
prosecuted
on
the
lesser
offence
or
breach
of
privilege
of
the
palace
and
its
precincts
ad
even
to
dismemberation
as
it
is
most
likely
you
will
yet
the
loss
of
a
member
is
nothing
to
being
hanged
and
drawn
quick
after
the
fashion
of
a
i
should
feel
the
shame
of
having
deserved
such
a
punishment
answered
nigel
more
than
the
pain
of
undergoing
doubtless
my
lord
the
having
as
you
say
deserved
it
must
be
an
excruciation
to
your
own
mind
replied
his
tormentor
a
kind
of
mental
and
metaphysical
hanging
drawing
and
quartering
which
may
be
in
some
measure
equipollent
with
the
external
application
of
hemp
iron
fire
and
the
like
to
the
outer
i
say
sir
mungo
repeated
nigel
and
beg
you
to
understand
my
words
that
i
am
unconscious
of
any
error
save
that
of
having
arms
on
my
person
when
i
chanced
to
approach
that
of
my
ye
are
right
my
lord
to
acknowledge
nothing
said
sir
mungo
we
have
an
old
proverb
confess
and
so
forth
and
indeed
as
to
the
weapons
his
majesty
has
a
special
at
all
arms
whatsoever
and
more
especially
pistols
but
as
i
said
there
is
an
end
of
that
matter
footnote
wilson
informs
us
that
when
colonel
grey
a
scotsman
who
affected
the
buff
dress
even
in
the
time
of
peace
appeared
in
that
military
garb
at
court
the
king
seeing
him
with
a
case
of
pistols
at
his
girdle
which
he
never
greatly
liked
told
him
merrily
he
was
now
so
fortified
that
if
he
were
but
well
victualled
he
would
be
wilson
and
reign
of
james
of
vol
ii
in
the
tenth
year
of
james
reign
there
was
a
rumour
abroad
that
a
shipload
of
had
been
exported
from
spain
with
a
view
to
a
general
massacre
of
the
protestants
proclamations
were
of
consequence
sent
forth
prohibiting
all
persons
from
carrying
pistols
under
a
foot
long
in
the
barrel
p
i
wish
you
as
well
through
the
next
which
is
altogether
surely
sir
mungo
answered
nigel
you
yourself
might
say
something
in
my
favour
concerning
the
affair
in
the
park
none
knows
better
than
you
that
i
was
at
that
moment
urged
by
wrongs
of
the
most
heinous
nature
offered
to
me
by
lord
dalgarno
many
of
which
were
reported
to
me
by
yourself
much
to
the
inflammation
of
my
replied
sir
mungo
i
remember
but
too
well
how
much
your
choler
was
inflamed
in
spite
of
the
various
remonstrances
which
i
made
to
you
respecting
the
sacred
nature
of
the
place
alas
alas
you
can
not
say
you
leaped
into
the
mire
for
want
of
i
see
sir
mungo
you
are
determined
to
remember
nothing
which
can
do
me
service
said
nigel
blithely
would
i
do
ye
service
said
the
knight
and
the
best
whilk
i
can
think
of
is
to
tell
you
the
process
of
the
punishment
to
the
whilk
you
will
be
indubitably
subjected
i
having
had
the
good
fortune
to
behold
it
performed
in
the
queen
time
on
a
chield
that
had
written
a
pasquinado
i
was
then
in
my
lord
gray
train
who
lay
leaguer
here
and
being
always
covetous
of
pleasing
and
profitable
sights
i
could
not
dispense
with
being
present
on
the
i
should
be
surprised
indeed
said
lord
glenvarloch
if
you
had
so
far
put
restraint
upon
your
benevolence
as
to
stay
away
from
such
an
hey
was
your
lordship
praying
me
to
be
present
at
your
own
execution
answered
the
knight
troth
my
lord
it
will
be
a
painful
sight
to
a
friend
but
i
will
rather
punish
myself
than
baulk
you
it
is
a
pretty
pageant
in
the
main
a
very
pretty
pageant
the
fallow
came
on
with
such
a
bold
face
it
was
a
pleasure
to
look
on
him
he
was
dressed
all
in
white
to
signify
harmlessness
and
innocence
the
thing
was
done
on
a
scaffold
at
westminster
most
likely
yours
will
be
at
the
charing
there
were
the
sheriffs
and
the
marshal
men
and
what
not
the
executioner
with
his
cleaver
and
mallet
and
his
man
with
a
pan
of
hot
charcoal
and
the
irons
for
cautery
he
was
a
dexterous
fallow
that
derrick
this
man
gregory
is
not
fit
to
jipper
a
joint
with
him
it
might
be
worth
your
lordship
while
to
have
the
loon
sent
to
a
to
learn
some
needful
scantling
of
anatomy
it
may
be
for
the
benefit
of
yourself
and
other
unhappy
sufferers
and
also
a
kindness
to
i
will
not
take
the
trouble
said
if
the
laws
will
demand
my
hand
the
executioner
may
get
it
off
as
he
best
can
if
the
king
leaves
it
where
it
is
it
may
chance
to
do
him
better
vera
noble
vera
grand
indeed
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
it
is
pleasant
to
see
a
brave
man
suffer
this
fallow
whom
i
spoke
of
this
tubbs
or
stubbs
or
whatever
the
plebeian
was
called
came
forward
as
bold
as
an
emperor
and
said
to
the
people
friends
i
come
to
leave
here
the
hand
of
a
true
englishman
and
clapped
it
on
the
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
laid
it
on
his
sweetheart
shoulder
whereupon
derrick
the
hangman
adjusting
d
mind
me
the
edge
of
his
cleaver
on
the
very
joint
hit
it
with
the
mallet
with
such
force
that
the
hand
flew
off
as
far
from
the
owner
as
a
gauntlet
which
the
challenger
casts
down
in
the
well
sir
stubbs
or
tubbs
lost
no
whit
of
countenance
until
the
fallow
clapped
the
iron
on
his
raw
stump
my
lord
it
fizzed
like
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
the
fallow
set
up
an
elritch
screech
which
made
some
think
his
courage
was
abated
but
not
a
whit
for
he
plucked
off
his
hat
with
his
left
hand
and
waved
it
crying
save
the
queen
and
confound
all
evil
counsellors
the
people
gave
him
three
cheers
which
he
deserved
for
his
stout
heart
and
truly
i
hope
to
see
your
lordship
suffer
with
the
same
i
thank
you
sir
mungo
said
nigel
who
had
not
been
able
to
forbear
some
natural
feelings
of
an
unpleasant
nature
during
this
lively
detail
i
have
no
doubt
the
exhibition
will
be
a
very
engaging
one
to
you
and
the
other
spectators
whatever
it
may
prove
to
the
party
principally
vera
engaging
answered
sir
mungo
vera
interesting
vera
interesting
indeed
though
not
altogether
so
much
so
as
an
execution
for
high
treason
i
saw
digby
the
winters
fawkes
and
the
rest
of
the
gunpowder
gang
suffer
for
that
treason
whilk
was
a
vera
grand
spectacle
as
well
in
regard
to
their
sufferings
as
to
their
constancy
in
i
am
the
more
obliged
to
your
goodness
sir
mungo
replied
nigel
that
has
induced
you
although
you
have
lost
the
sight
to
congratulate
me
on
my
escape
from
the
hazard
of
making
the
same
edifying
as
you
say
my
lord
answered
sir
mungo
the
loss
is
chiefly
in
appearance
nature
has
been
very
bountiful
to
us
and
has
given
duplicates
of
some
organs
that
we
may
endure
the
loss
of
one
of
them
should
some
such
circumstance
chance
in
our
pilgrimage
see
my
poor
dexter
abridged
to
one
thumb
one
finger
and
a
stump
by
the
blow
of
my
adversary
weapon
however
and
not
by
any
carnificial
knife
weel
sir
this
poor
maimed
hand
doth
me
in
some
sort
as
much
service
as
ever
and
admit
yours
to
be
taken
off
by
the
wrist
you
have
still
your
left
hand
for
your
service
and
are
better
off
than
the
little
dutch
dwarf
here
about
town
who
threads
a
needle
limns
writes
and
tosses
a
pike
merely
by
means
of
his
feet
without
ever
a
hand
to
help
well
sir
mungo
said
lord
glenvarloch
this
is
all
no
doubt
very
consolatory
but
i
hope
the
king
will
spare
my
hand
to
fight
for
him
in
battle
where
notwithstanding
all
your
kind
encouragement
i
could
spend
my
blood
much
more
cheerfully
than
on
a
it
is
even
a
sad
truth
replied
sir
mungo
that
your
lordship
was
but
too
like
to
have
died
on
a
scaffold
not
a
soul
to
speak
for
you
but
that
deluded
lassie
maggie
whom
mean
you
said
nigel
with
more
interest
than
he
had
hitherto
shown
in
the
knight
communications
nay
who
should
i
mean
but
that
travestied
lassie
whom
we
dined
with
when
we
honoured
heriot
the
goldsmith
ye
ken
best
how
you
have
made
interest
with
her
but
i
saw
her
on
her
knees
to
the
king
for
you
she
was
committed
to
my
charge
to
bring
her
up
hither
in
honour
and
safety
had
i
had
my
own
will
i
would
have
had
her
to
bridewell
to
flog
the
wild
blood
out
of
her
a
cutty
quean
to
think
of
wearing
the
breeches
and
not
so
much
as
married
yet
hark
ye
sir
mungo
malagrowther
answered
nigel
i
would
have
you
talk
of
that
young
person
with
fitting
with
all
the
respect
that
befits
your
lordship
paramour
and
davy
ramsay
daughter
i
shall
certainly
speak
of
her
my
lord
said
sir
mungo
assuming
a
dry
tone
of
irony
nigel
was
greatly
disposed
to
have
made
a
serious
quarrel
of
it
but
with
sir
mungo
such
an
affair
would
have
been
ridiculous
he
smothered
his
resentment
therefore
and
conjured
him
to
tell
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
respecting
this
young
person
simply
that
i
was
in
the
when
she
had
audience
and
heard
the
king
say
to
my
great
perplexity
sane
puella
and
maxwell
who
hath
but
indifferent
latin
ears
thought
that
his
majesty
called
on
him
by
his
own
name
of
sawney
and
thrust
into
the
presence
and
there
i
saw
our
sovereign
james
with
his
own
hand
raising
up
the
lassie
who
as
i
said
heretofore
was
travestied
in
man
attire
i
should
have
had
my
own
thoughts
of
it
but
our
gracious
master
is
auld
and
was
nae
great
gillravager
amang
the
queans
even
in
his
youth
and
he
was
comforting
her
in
his
own
way
and
saying
needna
greet
about
it
my
bonnie
woman
glenvarlochides
shall
have
fair
play
and
indeed
when
the
hurry
was
off
our
spirits
we
could
not
believe
that
he
had
any
design
on
our
person
and
touching
his
other
offences
we
will
look
wisely
and
closely
into
the
matter
so
i
got
charge
to
take
the
young
to
the
tower
here
and
deliver
her
to
the
charge
of
lady
mansel
and
his
majesty
charged
me
to
say
not
a
word
to
her
about
your
offences
for
said
he
the
poor
thing
is
breaking
her
heart
for
and
on
this
you
have
charitably
founded
the
opinion
to
the
prejudice
of
this
young
lady
which
you
have
now
thought
proper
to
express
said
lord
glenvarloch
in
honest
truth
my
lord
replied
sir
mungo
what
opinion
would
you
have
me
form
of
a
wench
who
gets
into
male
habiliments
and
goes
on
her
knees
to
the
king
for
a
wild
young
nobleman
i
wot
not
what
the
fashionable
word
may
be
for
the
phrase
changes
though
the
custom
abides
but
truly
i
must
needs
think
this
young
leddy
if
you
call
watchie
ramsay
daughter
a
young
leddy
demeans
herself
more
like
a
leddy
of
pleasure
than
a
leddy
of
you
do
her
egregious
wrong
sir
mungo
said
nigel
or
rather
you
have
been
misled
by
so
will
all
the
world
be
misled
my
lord
replied
the
satirist
unless
you
were
doing
that
to
disabuse
them
which
your
father
son
will
hardly
judge
it
fit
to
and
what
may
that
be
i
pray
you
marry
the
lass
make
her
leddy
ay
ay
ye
may
start
but
it
the
course
you
are
driving
on
rather
marry
than
do
worse
if
the
worst
be
not
done
sir
mungo
said
nigel
i
pray
you
to
forbear
this
subject
and
rather
return
to
that
of
the
mutilation
upon
which
it
pleased
you
to
enlarge
a
short
while
i
have
not
time
at
present
said
sir
mungo
hearing
the
clock
strike
four
but
so
soon
as
you
shall
have
received
sentence
my
lord
you
may
rely
on
my
giving
you
the
fullest
detail
of
the
whole
solemnity
and
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
knight
and
a
gentleman
that
i
will
myself
attend
you
on
the
scaffold
whoever
may
cast
sour
looks
on
me
for
doing
so
i
bear
a
heart
to
stand
by
a
friend
in
the
worst
of
so
saying
he
wished
lord
glenvarloch
farewell
who
felt
as
heartily
rejoiced
at
his
departure
though
it
may
be
a
bold
word
as
any
person
who
had
ever
undergone
his
society
but
when
left
to
his
own
reflections
nigel
could
not
help
feeling
solitude
nearly
as
irksome
as
the
company
of
sir
mungo
malagrowther
the
total
wreck
of
his
fortune
which
seemed
now
to
be
rendered
unavoidable
by
the
loss
of
the
royal
warrant
that
had
afforded
him
the
means
of
redeeming
his
paternal
estate
was
an
unexpected
and
additional
blow
when
he
had
seen
the
warrant
he
could
not
precisely
remember
but
was
inclined
to
think
it
was
in
the
casket
when
he
took
out
money
to
pay
the
miser
for
his
lodgings
at
whitefriars
since
then
the
casket
had
been
almost
constantly
under
his
own
eye
except
during
the
short
time
he
was
separated
from
his
baggage
by
the
arrest
in
greenwich
park
it
might
indeed
have
been
taken
out
at
that
time
for
he
had
no
reason
to
think
either
his
person
or
his
property
was
in
the
hands
of
those
who
wished
him
well
but
on
the
other
hand
the
locks
of
the
had
sustained
no
violence
that
he
could
observe
and
being
of
a
particular
and
complicated
construction
he
thought
they
could
scarce
be
opened
without
an
instrument
made
on
purpose
adapted
to
their
peculiarities
and
for
this
there
had
been
no
time
but
speculate
as
he
would
on
the
matter
it
was
clear
that
this
important
document
was
gone
and
probable
that
it
had
passed
into
no
friendly
hands
let
it
be
so
said
nigel
to
himself
i
am
scarcely
worse
off
respecting
my
prospects
of
fortune
than
when
i
first
reached
this
accursed
city
but
to
be
hampered
with
cruel
accusations
and
stained
with
foul
be
the
object
of
pity
of
the
most
degrading
kind
to
yonder
honest
citizen
and
of
the
malignity
of
that
envious
and
atrabilarious
courtier
who
can
endure
the
good
fortune
and
good
qualities
of
another
no
more
than
the
mole
can
brook
sunshine
this
is
indeed
a
deplorable
reflection
and
the
consequences
must
stick
to
my
future
life
and
impede
whatever
my
head
or
my
hand
if
it
is
left
me
might
be
able
to
execute
in
my
the
feeling
that
he
is
the
object
of
general
dislike
and
dereliction
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
unendurably
painful
to
which
a
human
being
can
be
subjected
the
most
atrocious
criminals
whose
nerves
have
not
shrunk
from
perpetrating
the
most
horrid
cruelty
endure
more
from
the
consciousness
that
no
man
will
sympathise
with
their
sufferings
than
from
apprehension
of
the
personal
agony
of
their
impending
punishment
and
are
known
often
to
attempt
to
palliate
their
enormities
and
sometimes
altogether
to
deny
what
is
established
by
the
clearest
proof
rather
than
to
leave
life
under
the
general
ban
of
humanity
it
was
no
wonder
that
nigel
labouring
under
the
sense
of
general
though
unjust
suspicion
should
while
pondering
on
so
painful
a
theme
recollect
that
one
at
least
had
not
only
believed
him
innocent
but
hazarded
herself
with
all
her
feeble
power
to
interpose
in
his
behalf
poor
girl
he
repeated
poor
rash
but
generous
maiden
your
fate
is
that
of
her
in
scottish
story
who
thrust
her
arm
into
the
staple
of
the
door
to
oppose
it
as
a
bar
against
the
assassins
who
threatened
the
murder
of
her
sovereign
the
deed
of
devotion
was
useless
save
to
give
an
immortal
name
to
her
by
whom
it
was
done
and
whose
blood
flows
it
is
said
in
the
veins
of
my
i
can
not
explain
to
the
reader
whether
the
recollection
of
this
historical
deed
of
devotion
and
the
lively
effect
which
the
comparison
a
little
overstrained
perhaps
was
likely
to
produce
in
favour
of
margaret
ramsay
was
not
qualified
by
the
concomitant
ideas
of
ancestry
and
ancient
descent
with
which
that
recollection
was
mingled
but
the
contending
feelings
suggested
a
new
train
of
ancestry
he
thought
and
ancient
descent
what
are
they
to
me
my
patrimony
alienated
my
title
become
a
reproach
for
what
can
be
so
absurd
as
titled
beggary
my
character
subjected
to
suspicion
i
will
not
remain
in
this
country
and
should
i
at
leaving
it
procure
the
society
of
one
so
lovely
so
brave
and
so
faithful
who
should
say
that
i
derogated
from
the
rank
which
i
am
virtually
renouncing
there
was
something
romantic
and
pleasing
as
he
pursued
this
picture
of
an
attached
and
faithful
pair
becoming
all
the
world
to
each
other
and
stemming
the
tide
of
fate
arm
in
arm
and
to
be
linked
thus
with
a
creature
so
beautiful
and
who
had
taken
such
devoted
and
disinterested
concern
in
his
fortunes
formed
itself
into
such
a
vision
as
romantic
youth
loves
best
to
dwell
upon
suddenly
his
dream
was
painfully
dispelled
by
the
recollection
that
its
very
basis
rested
upon
the
most
selfish
ingratitude
on
his
own
part
lord
of
his
castle
and
his
towers
his
forests
and
fields
his
fair
patrimony
and
noble
name
his
mind
would
have
rejected
as
a
sort
of
impossibility
the
idea
of
elevating
to
his
rank
the
daughter
of
a
mechanic
but
when
degraded
from
his
nobility
and
plunged
into
poverty
and
difficulties
he
was
ashamed
to
feel
himself
not
unwilling
that
this
poor
girl
in
the
blindness
of
her
affection
should
abandon
all
the
better
prospects
of
her
own
settled
condition
to
embrace
the
precarious
and
doubtful
course
which
he
himself
was
condemned
to
the
generosity
of
nigel
mind
recoiled
from
the
selfishness
of
the
plan
of
happiness
which
he
projected
and
he
made
a
strong
effort
to
expel
from
his
thoughts
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
this
fascinating
female
or
at
least
not
to
permit
them
to
dwell
upon
the
perilous
circumstance
that
she
was
at
present
the
only
creature
living
who
seemed
to
consider
him
as
an
object
of
kindness
he
could
not
however
succeed
in
banishing
her
from
his
slumbers
when
after
having
spent
a
weary
day
he
betook
himself
to
a
perturbed
couch
the
form
of
margaret
mingled
with
the
wild
mass
of
dreams
which
his
late
adventures
had
suggested
and
even
when
copying
the
lively
narrative
of
sir
mungo
fancy
presented
to
him
the
blood
bubbling
and
hissing
on
the
heated
iron
margaret
stood
behind
him
like
a
spirit
of
light
to
breathe
healing
on
the
wound
at
length
nature
was
exhausted
by
these
fantastic
creations
and
nigel
slept
and
slept
soundly
until
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
which
had
often
broken
his
slumbers
about
the
same
hour
chapter
xxxi
many
come
up
sir
with
your
gentle
blood
here
a
red
stream
beneath
this
coarse
blue
doublet
that
warms
the
heart
as
kindly
as
if
drawn
from
the
far
source
of
old
assyrian
kings
who
first
made
mankind
subject
to
their
sway
the
sounds
to
which
we
alluded
in
our
last
were
no
other
than
the
grumbling
tones
of
richie
moniplies
voice
this
worthy
like
some
other
persons
who
rank
high
in
their
own
opinion
was
very
apt
when
he
could
have
no
other
auditor
to
hold
conversation
with
one
who
was
sure
to
be
a
willing
listener
i
mean
with
himself
he
was
now
brushing
and
arranging
lord
glenvarloch
clothes
with
as
much
composure
and
quiet
assiduity
as
if
he
had
never
been
out
of
his
service
and
grumbling

since

parted
the

finely
frayed

and
the

of

my

i
see
no
sword
but
that
will
be
in
respect
of
present
nigel
for
some
time
could
not
help
believing
that
he
was
still
in
a
dream
so
improbable
did
it
seem
that
his
domestic
whom
he
supposed
to
be
in
scotland
should
have
found
him
out
and
obtained
access
to
him
in
his
present
circumstances
looking
through
the
curtains
however
he
became
well
assured
of
the
fact
when
he
beheld
the
stiff
and
bony
length
of
richie
with
a
visage
charged
with
nearly
double
its
ordinary
degree
of
importance
employed
sedulously
in
brushing
his
cloak
and
refreshing
himself
with
whistling
or
humming
from
interval
to
interval
some
snatch
of
an
old
melancholy
scottish
although
sufficiently
convinced
of
the
identity
of
the
party
lord
glenvarloch
could
not
help
expressing
his
surprise
in
the
superfluous
question
in
the
name
of
heaven
richie
is
this
you
and
wha
else
suld
it
be
my
lord
answered
richie
i
dreamna
that
your
lordship
levee
in
this
place
is
like
to
be
attended
by
ony
that
are
not
bounded
thereto
by
i
am
rather
surprised
answered
nigel
that
it
should
be
attended
by
any
one
at
all
especially
by
you
richie
for
you
know
that
we
parted
and
i
thought
you
had
reached
scotland
long
i
crave
your
lordship
pardon
but
we
have
not
parted
yet
nor
are
soon
likely
so
to
do
for
there
gang
twa
folk
votes
to
the
unmaking
of
a
bargain
as
to
the
making
of
ane
though
it
was
your
pleasure
so
to
conduct
yourself
that
we
were
like
to
have
parted
yet
it
was
not
on
reflection
my
will
to
be
gone
to
be
plain
if
your
lordship
does
not
ken
when
you
have
a
good
servant
i
ken
when
i
have
a
kind
master
and
to
say
truth
you
will
be
easier
served
now
than
ever
for
there
is
not
much
chance
of
your
getting
out
of
i
am
indeed
bound
over
to
good
behaviour
said
lord
glenvarloch
with
a
smile
but
i
hope
you
will
not
take
advantage
of
my
situation
to
be
too
severe
on
my
follies
richie
god
forbid
my
lord
god
forbid
replied
richie
with
an
expression
betwixt
a
conceited
consciousness
of
superior
wisdom
and
real
feeling
especially
in
consideration
of
your
lordship
having
a
due
sense
of
them
i
did
indeed
remonstrate
as
was
my
humble
duty
but
i
scorn
to
cast
that
up
to
your
lordship
now
na
na
i
am
myself
an
erring
creature
very
conscious
of
some
small
weaknesses
there
is
no
perfection
in
but
richie
said
lord
glenvarloch
although
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
proffered
service
it
can
be
of
little
use
to
me
here
and
may
be
of
prejudice
to
your
lordship
shall
pardon
me
again
said
richie
whom
the
relative
situation
of
the
parties
had
invested
with
ten
times
his
ordinary
dogmatism
but
as
i
will
manage
the
matter
your
lordship
shall
be
greatly
benefited
by
my
service
and
i
myself
no
whit
i
see
not
how
that
can
be
my
friend
said
lord
glenvarloch
since
even
as
to
your
pecuniary
affairs
touching
my
pecuniars
my
lord
replied
richie
i
am
indifferently
weel
provided
and
as
it
chances
my
living
here
will
be
no
burden
to
your
lordship
or
distress
to
myself
only
i
crave
permission
to
annex
certain
conditions
to
my
servitude
with
your
annex
what
you
will
said
lord
glenvarloch
for
you
are
pretty
sure
to
take
your
own
way
whether
you
make
any
conditions
or
not
since
you
will
not
leave
me
which
were
i
think
your
wisest
course
you
must
and
i
suppose
will
serve
me
only
on
such
terms
as
you
like
all
that
i
ask
my
lord
said
richie
gravely
and
with
a
tone
of
great
moderation
is
to
have
the
uninterrupted
command
of
my
own
motions
for
certain
important
purposes
which
i
have
now
in
hand
always
giving
your
lordship
the
solace
of
my
company
and
attendance
at
such
times
as
may
be
at
once
convenient
for
me
and
necessary
for
your
of
which
i
suppose
you
constitute
yourself
sole
judge
replied
nigel
smiling
unquestionably
my
lord
answered
richie
gravely
for
your
lordship
can
only
know
what
yourself
want
whereas
i
who
see
both
sides
of
the
picture
ken
both
what
is
the
best
for
your
affairs
and
what
is
the
most
needful
for
my
richie
my
good
friend
said
nigel
i
fear
this
arrangement
which
places
the
master
much
under
the
disposal
of
the
servant
would
scarce
suit
us
if
we
were
both
at
large
but
a
prisoner
as
i
am
i
may
be
as
well
at
your
disposal
as
i
am
at
that
of
so
many
other
persons
and
so
you
may
come
and
go
as
you
list
for
i
suppose
you
will
not
take
my
advice
to
return
to
your
own
country
and
leave
me
to
my
the
deil
be
in
my
feet
if
i
do
said
moniplies
i
am
not
the
lad
to
leave
your
lordship
in
foul
weather
when
i
followed
you
and
fed
upon
you
through
the
whole
summer
day
and
besides
there
may
be
brave
days
behind
for
a
that
has
come
and
gane
yet
for
it
hame
and
it
hame
and
it
hame
we
fain
would
be
though
the
cloud
is
in
the
lift
and
the
wind
is
on
the
lea
for
the
sun
through
the
mirk
blinks
blithe
on
mine
ee
says
shine
on
ye
yet
in
our
ain
country
having
sung
this
stanza
in
the
manner
of
a
whose
voice
has
been
cracked
by
matching
his
windpipe
against
the
bugle
of
the
north
blast
richie
moniplies
aided
lord
glenvarloch
to
rise
attended
his
toilet
with
every
possible
mark
of
the
most
solemn
and
deferential
respect
then
waited
upon
him
at
breakfast
and
finally
withdrew
pleading
that
he
had
business
of
importance
which
would
detain
him
for
some
hours
although
lord
glenvarloch
necessarily
expected
to
be
occasionally
annoyed
by
the
and
dogmatism
of
richie
character
yet
he
could
not
but
feel
the
greatest
pleasure
from
the
firm
and
devoted
attachment
which
this
faithful
follower
had
displayed
in
the
present
instance
and
indeed
promised
himself
an
alleviation
of
the
ennui
of
his
imprisonment
in
having
the
advantage
of
his
services
it
was
therefore
with
pleasure
that
he
learned
from
the
warder
that
his
servant
attendance
would
be
allowed
at
all
times
when
the
general
rules
of
the
fortress
permitted
the
entrance
of
strangers
in
the
meanwhile
the
magnanimous
richie
moniplies
had
already
reached
tower
wharf
here
after
looking
with
contempt
on
several
scullers
by
whom
he
was
plied
and
whose
services
he
rejected
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
called
with
dignity
first
oars
and
stirred
into
activity
several
lounging
tritons
of
the
higher
order
who
had
not
on
his
first
appearance
thought
it
worth
while
to
accost
him
with
proffers
of
service
he
now
took
possession
of
a
wherry
folded
his
arms
within
his
ample
cloak
and
sitting
down
in
the
stern
with
an
air
of
importance
commanded
them
to
row
to
whitehall
stairs
having
reached
the
palace
in
safety
he
demanded
to
see
master
linklater
the
of
his
majesty
kitchen
the
reply
was
that
he
was
not
to
be
spoken
withal
being
then
employed
in
cooking
a
mess
of
for
the
own
mouth
tell
him
said
moniplies
that
it
is
a
dear
countryman
of
his
who
seeks
to
converse
with
him
on
matter
of
high
a
dear
countryman
said
linklater
when
this
pressing
message
was
delivered
to
him
well
let
him
come
in
and
be
d
d
that
i
should
say
sae
this
now
is
some
frae
the
west
port
that
hearing
of
my
promotion
is
come
up
to
be
a
or
deputy
scullion
through
my
interest
it
is
a
great
hinderance
to
any
man
who
would
rise
in
the
world
to
have
such
friends
to
hang
by
his
skirts
in
hope
of
being
towed
up
along
with
ha
richie
moniplies
man
is
it
thou
and
what
has
brought
ye
here
if
they
should

that

the
other

on
the
auld
errand
i

linklater
then
shouted
to
his
assistant
in
the
kitchen
look
to
the
broches
ye

fac
macerentur
i
will
make
you
understand
latin
ye
knaves
as
becomes
the
scullions
of
king
then
in
a
cautious
tone
to
richie
private
ear
he
continued
know
ye
not
how
ill
your
master
came
off
the
other
day
i
can
tell

that
job

most
grateful
to

answered
linklater
you
have
certainly
sworn
to
say
your
prayers
in
the
porter
lodge
with
your
back
bare
and
twa
grooms
with
to
cry
amen
to

richie
i

and
ye
will

yoursell
if
ye
will
but
get
that
bit
note
to
the
king
i
will
have
neither
hand
nor
foot
in
the
matter
said
the
cautious
clerk
of
the
kitchen
but
there
is
his
majesty
mess
of
just
going
to
be
served
to
him
in
his
closet
i
can
not
prevent
you
from
putting
the
letter
between
the
gilt
bowl
and
the
platter
his
sacred
majesty
will
see
it
when
he
lifts
the
bowl
for
he
aye
drinks
out
the
enough
said
replied
richie
and
deposited
the
paper
accordingly
just
before
a
page
entered
to
carry
away
the
mess
to
his
majesty
aweel
aweel
neighbour
said
laurence
when
the
mess
was
taken
away
if
ye
have
done
ony
thing
to
bring
yoursell
to
the
withy
or
the
scourging
post
it
is
your
ain
wilful
i
will
blame
no
other
for
it
said
richie
and
with
that
undismayed
pertinacity
of
conceit
which
made
a
fundamental
part
of
his
character
he
abode
the
issue
which
was
not
long
of
arriving
in
a
few
minutes
maxwell
himself
arrived
in
the
apartment
and
demanded
hastily
who
had
placed
a
writing
on
the
king
trencher
linklater
denied
all
knowledge
of
it
but
richie
moniplies
stepping
boldly
forth
pronounced
the
emphatical
confession
i
am
the
follow
me
then
said
maxwell
after
regarding
him
with
a
look
of
great
curiosity
they
went
up
a
private
staircase
even
that
private
staircase
the
privilege
of
which
at
court
is
accounted
a
nearer
road
to
power
than
the
themselves
arriving
in
what
richie
described
as
an
ill
the
usher
made
a
sign
to
him
to
stop
while
he
went
into
the
king
closet
their
conference
was
short
and
as
maxwell
opened
the
door
to
retire
richie
heard
the
conclusion
of
it
ye
are
sure
he
is
not
dangerous
i
was
caught
bide
within
call
but
not
nearer
the
door
than
within
three
geometrical
cubits
if
i
speak
loud
start
to
me
like
a
falcon
if
i
speak
loun
keep
your
lang
lugs
out
of
and
now
let
him
come
richie
passed
forward
at
maxwell
mute
signal
and
in
a
moment
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
king
most
men
of
richie
birth
and
breeding
and
many
others
would
have
been
abashed
at
finding
themselves
alone
with
their
sovereign
but
richie
moniplies
had
an
opinion
of
himself
too
high
to
be
controlled
by
any
such
ideas
and
having
made
his
stiff
reverence
he
arose
once
more
into
his
perpendicular
height
and
stood
before
james
as
stiff
as
a
have
ye
gotten
them
man
have
ye
gotten
them
said
the
king
in
a
fluttered
state
betwixt
hope
and
eagerness
and
some
touch
of
suspicious
fear
gie
me
them
gie
me
them
before
ye
speak
a
word
i
charge
you
on
your
richie
took
a
box
from
his
bosom
and
stooping
on
one
knee
presented
it
to
his
majesty
who
hastily
opened
it
and
having
ascertained
that
it
contained
a
certain
carcanet
of
rubies
with
which
the
reader
was
formerly
made
acquainted
he
could
not
resist
falling
into
a
sort
of
rapture
kissing
the
gems
as
if
they
had
been
capable
of
feeling
and
repeating
again
and
again
with
childish
delight
cum
prole
cum
prole
ah
my
bright
and
bonny
sparklers
my
heart
loups
light
to
see
you
he
then
turned
to
richie
upon
whose
stoical
countenance
his
majesty
demeanour
had
excited
something
like
a
grim
smile
which
james
interrupted
his
rejoicing
to
reprehend
saying
take
heed
sir
you
are
not
to
laugh
at
us
we
are
your
anointed
god
forbid
that
i
should
laugh
said
richie
composing
his
countenance
into
its
natural
rigidity
i
did
but
smile
to
bring
my
visage
into
coincidence
and
conformity
with
your
majesty
ye
speak
as
a
dutiful
subject
and
an
honest
man
said
the
king
but
what
deil
your
name
man
even
richie
moniplies
the
son
of
auld
mungo
moniplies
at
the
west
port
of
edinburgh
who
had
the
honour
to
supply
your
majesty
royal
table
as
weel
as
your
majesty
with
flesh
and
other
vivers
when
time
aha
said
the
king
laughing
for
he
possessed
as
a
useful
attribute
of
his
situation
a
tenacious
memory
which
recollected
every
one
with
whom
he
was
brought
into
casual
contact
ye
are
the
traitor
who
had
weelnigh

but
we
stuck

our

richie
for
as
many

have
turned

it
is

that
a

then
suld

to

again
exclaimed
the
king
by
my
honour
he
lies
in
ambush
for
us
at
every
corner
maxwell
knocks
at
the
door
it
is

geordie

ready
with
his
of

sae
accursedly
backward
with
his
of
siller
that
by
our
royal
saul
we
are
glad
to
get
a
hair
in
his
richie
got
behind
the
arras
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
king
while
the
monarch
who
never
allowed
his
dignity
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
frolic
having
adjusted
with
his
own
hand
the
tapestry
so
as
to
complete
the
ambush
commanded
maxwell
to
tell
him
what
was
the
matter
without
maxwell
reply
was
so
low
as
to
be
lost
by
richie
moniplies
the
peculiarity
of
whose
situation
by
no
means
abated
his
curiosity
and
desire
to
gratify
it
to
the
uttermost
let
geordie
heriot
come
in
said
the
king
and
as
richie
could
observe
through
a
slit
in
the
tapestry
the
honest
citizen
if
not
actually
agitated
was
at
least
discomposed
the
king
whose
talent
for
wit
or
humour
was
precisely
of
a
kind
to
be
gratified
by
such
a
scene
as
ensued
received
his
homage
with
coldness
and
began
to
talk
to
him
with
an
air
of
serious
dignity
very
different
from
the
usual
indecorous
levity
of
his
behaviour
master
heriot
he
said
if
we
aright
remember
we
opignorated
in
your
hands
certain
jewels
of
the
crown
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
did
we
or
did
we
not
my
most
gracious
sovereign
said
heriot
indisputably
your
majesty
was
pleased
to
do
the
property
of
which
jewels
and
remained
with
us
continued
the
king
in
the
same
solemn
tone
subject
only
to
your
claim
of
advance
thereupon
which
advance
being
repaid
gives
us
right
to
repossession
of
the
thing
opignorated
or
pledged
or
laid
in

voetius

point
the

the
english
common
law
and
the
municipal
law
of
our
ain
ancient
kingdom
of
scotland
though
they
split
in
mair
particulars
than
i
could
desire
unite
as
strictly
in
this
as
the
three
strands
of
a
twisted
may
it
please
your
majesty
replied
heriot
it
requires
not
so
many
learned
authorities
to
prove
to
any
honest
man
that
his
interest
in
a
pledge
is
determined
when
the
money
lent
is
weel
sir
i
proffer
restoration
of
the
sum
lent
and
i
demand
to
be
repossessed
of
the
jewels
pledged
with
you
i
gave
ye
a
hint
brief
while
since
that
this
would
be
essential
to
my
service
for
as
approaching
events
are
like
to
call
us
into
public
it
would
seem
strange
if
we
did
not
appear
with
those
ornaments
which
are
heirlooms
of
the
crown
and
the
absence
whereof
is
like
to
place
us
in
contempt
and
suspicion
with
our
liege
master
george
heriot
seemed
much
moved
by
this
address
of
his
sovereign
and
replied
with
emotion
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
am
totally
harmless
in
this
matter
and
that
i
would
willingly
lose
the
sum
advanced
so
that
i
could
restore
those
jewels
the
absence
of
which
your
majesty
so
justly
laments
had
the
jewels
remained
with
me
the
account
of
them
would
be
easily
rendered
but
your
majesty
will
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
by
your
express
order
i
transferred
them
to
another
person
who
advanced
a
large
sum
just
about
the
time
of
my
departure
for
paris
the
money
was
pressingly
wanted
and
no
other
means
to
come
by
it
occurred
to
me
i
told
your
majesty
when
i
brought
the
needful
supply
that
the
man
from
whom
the
monies
were
obtained
was
of
no
good
repute
and
your
most
princely
answer
was
smelling
to
the
gold
it
smells
not
of
the
means
that
have
gotten
weel
man
said
the
king
but
what
needs
a
this
din
if
ye
gave
my
jewels
in
pledge
to
such
a
one
suld
ye
not
as
a
liege
subject
have
taken
care
that
the
redemption
was
in
our
power
and
are
we
to
suffer
the
loss
of
our
by
your
neglect
besides
being
exposed
to
the
scorn
and
censure
of
our
lieges
and
of
the
foreign
ambassadors
my
lord
and
liege
king
said
heriot
god
knows
if
my
bearing
blame
or
shame
in
this
matter
would
keep
it
from
your
majesty
it
were
my
duty
to
endure
both
as
a
servant
grateful
for
many
benefits
but
when
your
majesty
considers
the
violent
death
of
the
man
himself
the
disappearance
of
his
daughter
and
of
his
wealth
i
trust
you
will
remember
that
i
warned
your
majesty
in
humble
duty
of
the
possibility
of
such
casualties
and
prayed
you
not
to
urge
me
to
deal
with
him
on
your
but
you
brought
me
nae
better
means
said
the
king
geordie
ye
brought
me
nae
better
means
i
was
like
a
deserted
man
what
could
i
do
but
grip
to
the
first
siller
that
offered
as
a
drowning
man
grasps
to
the
that
comes
readiest
and
now
man
what
for
have
ye
not
brought
back
the
jewels
they
are
surely
above
ground
if
ye
wad
make
strict
all
strict
search
has
been
made
may
it
please
your
majesty
replied
the
citizen
hue
and
cry
has
been
sent
out
everywhere
and
it
has
been
found
impossible
to
recover
difficult
ye
mean
geordie
not
impossible
replied
the
king
for
that
whilk
is
impossible
is
either
naturally
so
to
make
two
into
three
or
morally
so
as
to
make
what
is
truth
falsehood
but
what
is
only
difficult
may
come
to
pass
with
assistance
of
wisdom
and
patience
as
for
example
jingling
geordie
look
here
and
he
displayed
the
recovered
treasure
to
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
jeweller
exclaiming
with
great
triumph
what
say
ye
to
that
jingler
by
my
sceptre
and
crown
the
man
stares
as
if
he
took
his
native
prince
for
a
warlock
us
that
are
the
very
the
contunding
and
contriturating
hammer
of
all
witches
sorcerers
magicians
and
the
like
he
thinks
we
are
taking
a
touch
of
the
black
art
outsells
but
gang
thy
way
honest
geordie
thou
art
a
good
plain
man
but
nane
of
the
seven
sages
of
greece
gang
thy
way
and
mind
the
soothfast
word
which
you
spoke
small
time
syne
that
there
is
one
in
this
land
that
comes
near
to
solomon
king
of
israel
in
all
his
gifts
except
in
his
love
to
strange
women
forby
the
daughter
of
if
heriot
was
surprised
at
seeing
the
jewels
so
unexpectedly
produced
at
the
moment
the
king
was
upbraiding
him
for
the
loss
of
them
this
allusion
to
the
reflection
which
had
escaped
him
while
conversing
with
lord
glenvarloch
altogether
completed
his
astonishment
and
the
king
was
so
delighted
with
the
superiority
which
it
gave
him
at
the
moment
that
he
rubbed
his
hands
chuckled
and
finally
his
sense
of
dignity
giving
way
to
the
full
feeling
of
triumph
he
threw
himself
into
his
and
laughed
with
unconstrained
violence
till
he
lost
his
breath
and
the
tears
ran
plentifully
down
his
cheeks
as
he
strove
to
recover
it
meanwhile
the
royal
cachinnation
was
echoed
out
by
a
discordant
and
portentous
laugh
from
behind
the
arras
like
that
of
one
who
little
accustomed
to
give
way
to
such
emotions
feels
himself
at
some
particular
impulse
unable
either
to
control
or
to
modify
his
obstreperous
mirth
heriot
turned
his
head
with
new
surprise
towards
the
place
from
which
sounds
so
unfitting
the
presence
of
a
monarch
seemed
to
burst
with
such
emphatic
clamour
the
king
too
somewhat
sensible
of
the
indecorum
rose
up
wiped
his
eyes
and
calling
todlowrie
come
out
o
your
den
he
produced
from
behind
the
arras
the
length
of
richie
moniplies
still
laughing
with
as
unrestrained
mirth
as
ever
did
gossip
at
a
country
christening
whisht
man
whisht

said
the
king
ye

it
was
a
pleasing
jest

than

to

in
amongst
george
heriot
when
his
first
surprise
was
over
was
too
old
a
courtier
to
interrupt
the
king
imaginary
triumph
although
he
darted
a
look
of
some
displeasure
at
honest
richie
who
still
continued
on
what
is
usually
termed
the
broad
grin
he
quietly
examined
the
stones
and
finding
them
all
perfect
he
honestly
and
sincerely
congratulated
his
majesty
on
the
recovery
of
a
treasure
which
could
not
have
been
lost
without
some
dishonour
to
the
crown
and
asked
to
whom
he
himself
was
to
pay
the
sums
for
which
they
had
been
pledged
observing
that
he
had
the
money

doubtless
at

when
i

the
guise
in

i

noble
lord
glenvarloch
presently
prisoner
in
your
royal
tower
of
how

how

how
man
exclaimed
the
king
reddening
and
stammering
but
with
emotions
more
noble
than
those
by
which
he
was
sometimes
agitated
what
is
that
you
dare
to
say
to
us
sell
our
justice
sell
our
mercy
and
we
a
crowned
king
sworn
to
do
justice
to
our
subjects
in
the
gate
and
responsible
for
our
stewardship
to
him
that
is
over
all
kings
here
he
reverently
looked
up
touched
his
bonnet
and
continued
with
some
sharpness
we
dare
not
traffic
in
such
commodities
sir

but
that
ye
are
a
poor
ignorant
creature

richie
who
had
counted
with
the
utmost
certainty
upon
the
success
of
this
of
policy
was
like
an
architect
whose
whole
scaffolding
at
once
gives
way
under
him
he
caught
however
at
what
he
thought
might
break
his
fall
not
only
the
sum
for
which
the
jewels
were
pledged
he
said
but
the
double
of
it
if
required
should
be
placed
at
his
majesty
command
and
even
without
hope
or
condition
of
repayment
if
only
but
the
king
did
not
allow
him
to
complete
the
sentence
crying
out
with
greater
vehemence
than
before
as
if
he
dreaded
the
stability
of
his
own
good
resolutions
awa
wi

in
obedience
to
the
royal
mandate
george
heriot
hurried
the
abashed
petitioner
out
of
the
presence
and
out
of
the
palace
and
when
they
were
in
the
the
citizen
remembering
with
some
resentment
the
airs
of
equality
which
richie
had
assumed
towards
him
in
the
commencement
of
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
could
not
forbear
to
retaliate
by
congratulating
him
with
an
ironical
smile
on
his
favour
at
court
and
his
improved
grace
in
presenting
a
supplication
never
fash
your
beard
about
that
master
george
heriot
said
richie
totally
undismayed
but
tell
me
when
and
where
i
am
to
sifflicate
you
for
eight
hundred
pounds
sterling
for
which
these
jewels
stood
engaged
the
instant
that
you
bring
with
you
the
real
owner
of
the
money
replied
heriot
whom
it
is
important
that
i
should
see
on
more
accounts
than
then
will

said
richie

stoutly
and
get

the

the
pledge
back

i

fully
commissionate
to
act
in

it
may
be
so
richie
said
the
citizen
and
perchance
it
may
be
so
neither
for
your
tales
are
not
all
gospel
and
therefore
be
assured
i
will
see
that
it
so
ere
i
pay
you
that
large
sum
of
money
i
shall
give
you
an
acknowledgment
for
it
and
i
will
keep

in

i
am

to
return
to

petrified
when
he
beheld

and
found
himself
as
he
supposed
left
in
the

muttered
for
a
cunning

skinflint
that
because
ye
are
an
honest

forsooth

haughty

with
which
he
had
that
morning
entered
the
precincts
of
the
palace
into
a
skulking
shamble
he
retreated
for
his
wherry
which
was
in
attendance
with
speed
which
to
use
the
approved
phrase
on
such
occasions
greatly
resembled
a
flight
chapter
xxxii
this
looks
not
like
a
nuptial
ado
about
master
george
heriot
had
no
sooner
returned
to
the
king
apartment
than
james
inquired
of
maxwell
if
the
earl
of
huntinglen
was
in
attendance
and
receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
desired
that
he
should
be
admitted
the
old
scottish
lord
having
made
his
reverence
in
the
usual
manner
the
king
extended
his
hand
to
be
kissed
and
then
began
to
address
him
in
a
tone
of
great
sympathy
we
told
your
lordship
in
our
secret
epistle
of
this
morning
written
with
our
ain
hand
in
testimony
we
have
neither
pretermitted
nor
forgotten
your
faithful
service
that
we
had
that
to
communicate
to
you
that
would
require
both
patience
and
fortitude
to
endure
and
therefore
exhorted
you
to
peruse
some
of
the
most
pithy
passages
of
seneca
and
of
boethius
that
the
back
may
be
as
we
say
fitted
for
the
burden
this
we
commend
to
you
from
our
ain
experience
ignara
mail
miseris
succurrere
disco
sayeth
dido
and
i
might
say
in
my
own
person
but
to
change
the
gender
would
affect
the
prosody
whereof
our
southern
subjects
are
tenacious
so
my
lord
of
huntinglen
i
trust
you
have
acted
by
our
advice
and
studied
patience
before
ye
need
it
occurrite
mix
the
medicament
when
the
disease
is
coming
may
it
please
your
majesty
answered
lord
huntinglen
i
am
more
of
an
old
soldier
than
a
scholar
and
if
my
own
rough
nature
will
not
bear
me
out
in
any
calamity
i
hope
i
shall
have
grace
to
try
a
text
of
scripture
to
ay
man
are
you
there
with
your
bears
said
the
king
the
bible
man
touching
his
cap
is
indeed
et
but
it
is
pity
your
lordship
can
not
peruse
it
in
the
original
for
although
we
did
ourselves
promote
that
work
of
translation
since
ye
may
read
at
the
beginning
of
every
bible
that
when
some
palpable
clouds
of
darkness
were
thought
like
to
have
overshadowed
the
land
after
the
setting
of
that
bright
occidental
star
queen
elizabeth
yet
our
appearance
like
that
of
the
sun
in
his
strength
instantly
dispelled
these
surmised
mists
i
say
that
although
as
therein
mentioned
we
countenanced
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
and
especially
the
translation
of
the
scriptures
out
of
the
original
sacred
tongues
yet
nevertheless
we
ourselves
confess
to
have
found
a
comfort
in
consulting
them
in
the
original
hebrew
whilk
we
do
not
perceive
even
in
the
latin
version
of
the
septuagint
much
less
in
the
english
please
your
majesty
said
lord
huntinglen
if
your
majesty
delays
communicating
the
bad
news
with
which
your
honoured
letter
threatens
me
until
i
am
capable
to
read
hebrew
like
your
majesty
i
fear
i
shall
die
in
ignorance
of
the
misfortune
which
hath
befallen
or
is
about
to
befall
my
you
will
learn
it
but
too
soon
my
lord
replied
the
king
i
grieve
to
say
it
but
your
son
dalgarno
whom
i
thought
a
very
saint
as
he
was
so
much
with
steenie
and
baby
charles
hath
turned
out
a
very
villain
repeated
lord
huntinglen
and
though
he
instantly
checked
himself
and
added
but
it
is
your
majesty
speaks
the
word
the
effect
of
his
first
tone
made
the
king
step
back
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
he
also
recovered
himself
again
and
said
in
the
pettish
way
which
usually
indicated
his
displeasure
yes
my
lord
it
was
we
that
said
it
surdo
we
are
not
deaf
we
pray
you
not
to
raise
your
voice
in
speech
with
us
there
is
the
bonny
memorial
read
and
judge
for
the
king
then
thrust
into
the
old
nobleman
hand
a
paper
containing
the
story
of
the
lady
hermione
with
the
evidence
by
which
it
was
supported
detailed
so
briefly
and
clearly
that
the
infamy
of
lord
dalgarno
the
lover
by
whom
she
had
been
so
shamefully
deceived
seemed
undeniable
but
a
father
yields
not
up
so
easily
the
cause
of
his
son
may
it
please
your
majesty
he
said
why
was
this
tale
not
sooner
told
this
woman
hath
been
here
for
years
wherefore
was
the
claim
on
my
son
not
made
the
instant
she
touched
english
ground
tell
him
how
that
came
about
geordie
said
the
king
dressing
heriot
i
grieve
to
distress
my
lord
huntinglen
said
heriot
but
i
must
speak
the
truth
for
a
long
time
the
lady
hermione
could
not
brook
the
idea
of
making
her
situation
public
and
when
her
mind
became
changed
in
that
particular
it
was
necessary
to
recover
the
evidence
of
the
false
marriage
and
letters
and
papers
connected
with
it
which
when
she
came
to
paris
and
just
before
i
saw
her
she
had
deposited
with
a
correspondent
of
her
father
in
that
city
he
became
afterwards
bankrupt
and
in
consequence
of
that
misfortune
the
lady
papers
passed
into
other
hands
and
it
was
only
a
few
days
since
i
traced
and
recovered
them
without
these
documents
of
evidence
it
would
have
been
imprudent
for
her
to
have
preferred
her
complaint
favoured
as
lord
dalgarno
is
by
powerful
ye
are
saucy
to
say
sae
said
the
king
i
ken
what
ye
mean
weel
eneugh
ye
think
steenie
wad
hae
putten
the
weight
of
his
foot
into
the
scales
of
justice
and
garr
them
whomle
the
bucket
ye
forget
geordie
wha
it
is
whose
hand
uphaulds
them
and
ye
do
poor
steenie
the
mair
wrang
for
he
confessed
it
ance
before
us
and
our
privy
council
that
dalgarno
would
have
put
the
quean
aff
on
him
the
puir
simple
bairn
making
him
trow
that
she
was
a
in
whilk
mind
he
remained
assured
even
when
he
parted
from
her
albeit
steenie
might
hae
weel
thought
ane
of
thae
cattle
wadna
hae
resisted
the
like
of
the
lady
hermione
said
george
heriot
has
always
done
the
utmost
justice
to
the
conduct
of
the
duke
who
although
strongly
possessed
with
prejudice
against
her
character
yet
scorned
to
avail
himself
of
her
distress
and
on
the
contrary
supplied
her
with
the
means
of
extricating
herself
from
her
it
was
like
himsell
blessings
on
his
bonny
face
said
the
king
and
i
believed
this
lady
tale
the
mair
readily
my
lord
huntinglen
that
she
spake
nae
ill
of
steenie
and
to
make
a
lang
tale
short
my
lord
it
is
the
opinion
of
our
council
and
ourself
as
weel
as
of
baby
charles
and
steenie
that
your
son
maun
amend
his
wrong
by
wedding
this
lady
or
undergo
such
disgrace
and
discountenance
as
we
can
the
person
to
whom
he
spoke
was
incapable
of
answering
him
he
stood
before
the
king
motionless
and
glaring
with
eyes
of
which
even
the
lids
seemed
immovable
as
if
suddenly
converted
into
an
ancient
statue
of
the
times
of
chivalry
so
instantly
had
his
hard
features
and
strong
limbs
been
arrested
into
rigidity
by
the
blow
he
had
received
and
in
a
second
afterwards
like
the
same
statue
when
the
lightning
breaks
upon
it
he
sunk
at
once
to
the
ground
with
a
heavy
groan
the
king
was
in
the
utmost
alarm
called
upon
heriot
and
maxwell
for
help
and
presence
of
mind
not
being
his
ran
to
and
fro
in
his
cabinet
exclaiming
my
ancient
and
beloved
servant
who
saved
our
anointed
self
atque
dolor
my
lord
of
huntinglen
look
up
look
up
man
and
your
son
may
marry
the
queen
of
sheba
if
he
by
this
time
maxwell
and
heriot
had
raised
the
old
nobleman
and
placed
him
on
a
chair
while
the
king
observing
that
he
began
to
recover
himself
continued
his
consolations
more
methodically
haud
up
your
head
haud
up
your
head
and
listen
to
your
ain
kind
native
prince
if
there
is
shame
man
it
comesna
there
is
siller
to
gild
it
a
gude
tocher
and
no
that
bad
a
pedigree
if
she
has
been
a
loon
it
was
your
son
made
her
sae
and
he
can
make
her
an
honest
woman
these
suggestions
however
reasonable
in
the
common
case
gave
no
comfort
to
lord
huntinglen
if
indeed
he
fully
comprehended
them
but
the
blubbering
of
his
old
master
which
began
to
accompany
and
interrupt
his
royal
speech
produced
more
rapid
effect
the
large
tear
gushed
reluctantly
from
his
eye
as
he
kissed
the
withered
hands
which
the
king
weeping
with
less
dignity
and
restraint
abandoned
to
him
first
alternately
and
then
both
together
until
the
feelings
of
the
man
getting
entirely
the
better
of
the
sovereign
sense
of
dignity
he
grasped
and
shook
lord
huntinglen
hands
with
the
sympathy
of
an
equal
and
a
familiar
friend
said
the
monarch
be
patient
man
be
patient
the
council
and
baby
charles
and
steenie
may
a
gang
to
the
deevil
he
shall
not
marry
her
since
it
moves
you
so
he
marry
her
by
god
answered
the
earl
drawing
himself
up
dashing
the
tear
from
his
eyes
and
endeavouring
to
recover
his
composure
i
pray
your
majesty
pardon
but
he
shall
marry
her
with
her
dishonour
for
her
dowry
were
she
the
veriest
courtezan
in
all
spain
if
he
gave
his
word
he
shall
make
his
word
good
were
it
to
the
meanest
creature
that
haunts
the
streets
he
shall
do
it
or
my
own
dagger
shall
take
the
life
that
i
gave
him
if
he
could
stoop
to
use
so
base
a
fraud
though
to
deceive
infamy
let
him
wed
no
no
the
monarch
continued
to
insinuate
things
are
not
so
bad
as
that
steenie
himself
never
thought
of
her
being
a
streetwalker
even
when
he
thought
the
worst
of
if
it
can
at
all
console
my
lord
of
huntinglen
said
the
citizen
i
can
assure
him
of
this
lady
good
birth
and
most
fair
and
unspotted
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
lord
huntinglen
then
interrupting
himself
he
said
heaven
forgive
me
for
being
ungrateful
for
such
comfort
but
i
am
sorry
she
should
be
as
you
represent
her
so
much
better
than
the
villain
deserves
to
be
condemned
to
wed
beauty
and
innocence
and
honest
birth
ay
and
wealth
my
lord
wealth
insinuated
the
king
is
a
better
sentence
than
his
perfidy
has
it
is
long
said
the
embittered
father
since
i
saw
he
was
selfish
and
hardhearted
but
to
be
a
perjured
liar
i
never
dreaded
that
such
a
blot
would
have
fallen
on
my
race
i
will
never
look
on
him
hoot
ay
my
lord
hoot
ay
said
the
king
ye
maun
tak
him
to
task
roundly
i
grant
you
should
speak
more
in
the
vein
of
demea
than
mitio
nempe
et
via
pervulgata
but
as
for
not
seeing
him
again
and
he
your
only
son
that
is
altogether
out
of
reason
i
tell
ye
man
but
i
would
not
for
a
boddle
that
baby
charles
heard
me
that
he
might
gie
the
glaiks
to
half
the
lasses
of
lonnun
ere
i
could
find
in
my
heart
speak
such
harsh
words
as
you
have
said
of
this
deil
of
a
dalgarno
of
may
it
please
your
majesty
to
permit
me
to
retire
said
lord
huntinglen
and
dispose
of
the
case
according
to
your
own
royal
sense
of
justice
for
i
desire
no
favour
for
aweel
my
lord
so
be
it
and
if
your
lordship
can
think
added
the
monarch
of
any
thing
in
our
power
which
might
comfort
you
your
majesty
gracious
sympathy
said
lord
huntinglen
has
already
comforted
me
as
far
as
earth
can
the
rest
must
be
from
the
king
of
to
him
i
commend
you
my
auld
and
faithful
servant
said
james
with
emotion
as
the
earl
withdrew
from
his
presence
the
king
remained
fixed
in
thought
for
some
time
and
then
said
to
heriot
jingling
geordie
ye
ken
all
the
privy
doings
of
our
court
and
have
dune
so
these
thirty
years
though
like
a
wise
man
ye
hear
and
see
and
say
nothing
now
there
is
a
thing
i
fain
wad
ken
in
the
way
of
philosophical
inquiry
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
umquhile
lady
huntinglen
the
departed
countess
of
this
noble
earl
ganging
a
wee
bit
gleed
in
her
walk
through
the
world
i
mean
in
the
way
of
slipping
a
foot
casting
a
or
the
like
ye
understand
me
footnote
a
is
the
lowest
hoop
upon
a
or
allan
ramsay
applies
the
phrase
in
the
same
metaphorical
sense
or
bairns
can
read
they
first
maun
spell
i
learn
this
frae
my
mammy
and
cast
a
mysell
lang
ere
i
married
kirk
on
the
on
my
word
as
an
honest
man
said
george
heriot
somewhat
surprised
at
the
question
i
never
heard
her
wronged
by
the
slightest
breath
of
suspicion
she
was
a
worthy
lady
very
circumspect
in
her
walk
and
lived
in
great
concord
with
her
husband
save
that
the
good
countess
was
something
of
a
puritan
and
kept
more
company
with
ministers
than
was
altogether
agreeable
to
lord
huntinglen
who
is
as
your
majesty
well
knows
a
man
of
the
old
rough
world
that
will
drink
and
o
geordie
exclaimed
the
king
these
are
frailties
of
whilk
we
dare
not
pronounce
even
ourselves
absolutely
free
but
the
warld
grows
worse
from
day
to
day
geordie
the
juveniles
of
this
age
may
weel
say
with
the
poet
parentum
pejor
avis
tulit
nos
nequiores
this
dalgarno
does
not
drink
so
much
or
swear
so
much
as
his
father
but
he
wenches
geordie
and
he
breaks
his
word
and
oath
baith
as
to
what
you
say
of
the
leddy
and
the
ministers
we
are
a
fallible
creatures
geordie
priests
and
kings
as
weel
as
others
and
wha
kens
but
what
that
may
account
for
the
difference
between
this
dalgarno
and
his
father
the
earl
is
the
vera
soul
of
honour
and
cares
nae
mair
for
warld
gear
than
a
noble
hound
for
the
quest
of
a
foulmart
but
as
for
his
son
he
was
like
to
brazen
us
a
out
ourselves
steenie
baby
charles
and
our
council
till
he
heard
of
the
tocher
and
then
by
my
kingly
crown
he
lap
like
a
cock
at
a
grossart
these
are
discrepancies
betwixt
parent
and
son
not
to
be
accounted
for
naturally
according
to
baptista
porta
michael
scott
and
ah
jingling
geordie
if
your
clouting
the
caldron
and
jingling
on
pots
pans
and
veshels
of
all
manner
of
metal
hadna
jingled
a
your
grammar
out
of
your
head
i
could
have
touched
on
that
matter
to
you
at
mair
heriot
was
too
to
express
much
concern
for
the
loss
of
his
grammar
learning
on
this
occasion
but
after
modestly
hinting
that
he
had
seen
many
men
who
could
not
fill
their
father
bonnet
though
no
one
had
been
suspected
of
wearing
their
father
nightcap
he
inquired
whether
lord
dalgarno
had
consented
to
do
the
lady
hermione
troth
man
i
have
small
doubt
that
he
will
quoth
the
king
i
gave
him
the
schedule
of
her
worldly
substance
which
you
delivered
to
us
in
the
council
and
we
allowed
him
to
chew
the
cud
upon
that
it
is
rare
reading
for
bringing
him
to
reason
i
left
baby
charles
and
steenie
laying
his
duty
before
him
and
if
he
can
resist
doing
what
desire
him
why
i
wish
he
would
teach
the
gate
of
it
o
geordie
jingling
geordie
it
was
grand
to
hear
baby
charles
laying
down
the
guilt
of
dissimulation
and
steenie
lecturing
on
the
turpitude
of
incontinence
i
am
afraid
said
george
heriot
more
hastily
than
prudently
i
might
have
thought
of
the
old
proverb
of
satan
reproving
deil
hae
our
saul
neighbour
said
the
king
reddening
but
ye
are
not
blate
i
gie
ye
license
to
speak
freely
and
by
our
saul
ye
do
not
let
the
privilege
become
lost
it
will
suffer
no
negative
prescription
in
your
hands
is
it
fit
think
ye
that
baby
charles
should
let
his
thoughts
be
publicly
seen
no
no
princes
thoughts
are
nescit
dissimulare
nescit
every
liege
subject
is
bound
to
speak
the
whole
truth
to
the
king
but
there
is
nae
reciprocity
of
obligation
and
for
steenie
having
been
whiles
a
at
a
time
is
it
for
you
who
are
his
goldsmith
and
to
whom
i
doubt
he
awes
an
uncomatable
sum
to
cast
that
up
to
him
heriot
did
not
feel
himself
called
on
to
play
the
part
of
zeno
and
sacrifice
himself
for
upholding
the
cause
of
moral
truth
he
did
not
desert
it
however
by
disavowing
his
words
but
simply
expressed
sorrow
for
having
offended
his
majesty
with
which
the
placable
king
was
sufficiently
satisfied
and
now
geordie
man
quoth
he
we
will
to
this
culprit
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
for
i
will
see
the
job
cleared
this
blessed
day
ye
maun
come
wi
me
for
your
evidence
may
be
the
king
led
the
way
accordingly
into
a
larger
apartment
where
the
prince
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
one
or
two
privy
counsellors
were
seated
at
a
table
before
which
stood
lord
dalgarno
in
an
attitude
of
as
much
elegant
ease
and
indifference
as
could
be
expressed
considering
the
stiff
dress
and
manners
of
the
times
all
rose
and
bowed
reverently
while
the
king
to
use
a
north
country
word
expressive
of
his
mode
of
locomotion
to
his
chair
or
throne
making
a
sign
to
heriot
to
stand
behind
him
we
hope
said
his
majesty
that
lord
dalgarno
stands
prepared
to
do
justice
to
this
unfortunate
lady
and
to
his
own
character
and
honour
may
i
humbly
inquire
the
penalty
said
lord
dalgarno
in
case
i
should
unhappily
find
compliance
with
your
majesty
demands
impossible
banishment
frae
our
court
my
lord
said
the
king
frae
our
court
and
our
unhappy
exile
that
i
may
be
said
lord
dalgarno
in
a
tone
of
subdued
irony
i
will
at
least
carry
your
majesty
picture
with
me
for
i
shall
never
see
such
another
and
banishment
my
lord
said
the
prince
sternly
from
these
our
that
must
be
by
form
of
law
please
your
royal
highness
said
dalgarno
with
an
affectation
of
deep
respect
and
i
have
not
heard
that
there
is
a
statute
compelling
us
under
such
penalty
to
marry
every
woman
we
may
play
the
fool
with
perhaps
his
grace
of
buckingham
can
tell
me
you
are
a
villain
dalgarno
said
the
haughty
and
vehement
favourite
fie
my
lord
fie
to
a
prisoner
and
in
presence
of
your
royal
and
paternal
gossip
said
lord
dalgarno
but
i
will
cut
this
deliberation
short
i
have
looked
over
this
schedule
of
the
goods
and
effects
of
erminia
pauletti
daughter
of
the
late
noble
yes
he
is
called
the
noble
or
i
read
wrong
giovanni
pauletti
of
the
houee
of
sansovino
in
genoa
and
of
the
no
less
noble
lady
maud
olifaunt
of
the
house
of
glenvarloch
well
i
declare
that
i
was
in
spain
to
this
noble
lady
and
there
has
passed
betwixt
us
some
certain
and
now
what
more
does
this
grave
assembly
require
of
me
that
you
should
repair
the
gross
and
infamous
wrong
you
have
done
the
lady
by
marrying
her
within
this
hour
said
the
prince
o
may
it
please
your
royal
highness
answered
dalgarno
i
have
a
trifling
relationship
with
an
old
earl
who
calls
himself
my
father
who
may
claim
some
vote
in
the
matter
alas
every
son
is
not
blessed
with
an
obedient
parent
he
hazarded
a
slight
glance
towards
the
throne
to
give
meaning
to
his
last
words
we
have
spoken
ourselves
with
lord
huntinglen
said
the
king
and
are
authorised
to
consent
in
his
i
could
never
have
expected
this
intervention
of
a
which
the
vulgar
translate
blackfoot
of
such
eminent
dignity
said
dalgarno
scarce
concealing
a
sneer
and
my
father
hath
consented
he
was
wont
to
say
ere
we
left
scotland
that
the
blood
of
huntinglen
and
of
glenvarloch
would
not
mingle
were
they
poured
into
the
same
basin
perhaps
he
has
a
mind
to
try
the
experiment
my
lord
said
james
we
will
not
be
longer
trifled
with
will
you
instantly
and
take
this
lady
to
your
wife
in
our
chapel
atque
answered
lord
dalgarno
for
i
perceive
by
doing
so
i
shall
obtain
power
to
render
great
services
to
the
commonwealth
i
shall
have
acquired
wealth
to
supply
the
wants
of
your
majesty
and

fair
wife

the
command
of
his
grace
of
the
duke
rose
passed
to
the
end
of
the
table
where
lord
dalgarno
was
standing
and
whispered
in
his
ear
you
have
placed
a
fair
sister
at
my
command
ere
this
taunt
cut
deep
through
lord
dalgarno
assumed
composure
he
started
as
if
an
adder
had
stung
him
but
instantly
composed
himself
and
fixing
on
the
duke
still
smiling
countenance
an
eye
which
spoke
unutterable
hatred
he
pointed
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword
but
in
a
manner
which
could
scarce
be
observed
by
any
one
save
buckingham
the
duke
gave
him
another
smile
of
bitter
scorn
and
returned
to
his
seat
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
king
who
continued
calling

nae

your
majesty
needs
not
fear
my
patience
said
lord
dalgarno
and
that
i
may
keep
it
the
better
i
will
not
utter
another
word
in
this
presence
save
those
enjoined
to
me
in
that
happy
portion
of
the
which
begins
with
and
ends
with
you

a
hardened
villain
dalgarno
said
the
king
and
were
i
the
lass
by
my
father
saul
i
would
rather
brook
the
stain
of
having
been
your
concubine
than
run
the
risk
of
becoming
your
wife
but
she
shall
be
under
our
special
come
my
lords
we
will
ourselves
see
this
blithesome
he
gave
the
signal
by
rising
and
moved
towards
the
door
followed
by
the
train
lord
dalgarno
attended
speaking
to
none
and
spoken
to
by
no
one
yet
seeming
as
easy
and
unembarrassed
in
his
gait
and
manner
as
if
in
reality
a
happy
bridegroom
they
reached
the
chapel
by
a
private
entrance
which
communicated
from
the
royal
apartment
the
bishop
of
winchester
in
his
pontifical
dress
stood
beside
the
altar
on
the
other
side
supported
by
monna
paula
the
colourless
faded
form
of
the
lady
hermione
or
erminia
pauletti
lord
dalgarno
bowed
profoundly
to
her
and
the
prince
observing
the
horror
with
which
she
regarded
him
walked
up
and
said
to
her
with
much
dignity
madam
ere
you
put
yourself
under
the
authority
of
this
man
let
me
inform
you
he
hath
in
the
fullest
degree
vindicated
your
honour
so
far
as
concerns
your
former
intercourse
it
is
for
you
to
consider
whether
you
will
put
your
fortune
and
happiness
into
the
hands
of
one
who
has
shown
himself
unworthy
of
all
the
lady
with
much
difficulty
found
words
to
make
reply
i
owe
to
his
majesty
goodness
she
said
the
care
of
providing
me
some
reservation
out
of
my
own
fortune
for
my
decent
sustenance
the
rest
can
not
be
better
disposed
than
in
buying
back
the
fair
fame
of
which
i
am
deprived
and
the
liberty
of
ending
my
life
in
peace
and
the
contract
has
been
drawn
up
said
the
king
under
our
own
eye
specially
discharging
the
and
agreeing
they
shall
live
separate
so
buckle
them
my
lord
bishop
as
fast
as
you
can
that
they
may
sunder
again
the
the
bishop
accordingly
opened
his
book
and
commenced
the
marriage
ceremony
under
circumstances
so
novel
and
so
inauspicious
the
responses
of
the
bride
were
only
expressed
by
inclinations
of
the
head
and
body
while
those
of
the
bridegroom
were
spoken
boldly
and
distinctly
with
a
tone
resembling
levity
if
not
scorn
when
it
was
concluded
lord
dalgarno
advanced
as
if
to
salute
the
bride
but
seeing
that
she
drew
back
in
fear
and
abhorrence
he
contented
himself
with
making
her
a
low
bow
he
then
drew
up
his
form
to
its
height
and
stretched
himself
as
if
examining
the
power
of
his
limbs
but
elegantly
and
without
any
forcible
change
of
attitude
i
could
caper
yet
he
said
though
i
am
in
fetters
but
they
are
of
gold
and
lightly
well
i
see
all
eyes
look
cold
on
me
and
it
is
time
i
should
withdraw
the
sun
shines
elsewhere
than
in
england
but
first
i
must
ask
how
this
fair
lady
dalgarno
is
to
be
bestowed
methinks
it
is
but
decent
i
should
know
is
she
to
be
sent
to
the
harem
of
my
lord
duke
or
is
this
worthy
citizen
as
before
hold
thy
base
ribald
tongue
said
his
father
lord
huntinglen
who
had
kept
in
the
background
during
the
ceremony
and
now
stepping
suddenly
forward
caught
the
lady
by
the
arm
and
confronted
her
unworthy
the
lady
dalgarno
he
continued
shall
remain
as
a
widow
in
my
house
a
widow
i
esteem
her
as
much
as
if
the
grave
had
closed
over
her
dishonoured
lord
dalgarno
exhibited
momentary
symptoms
of
extreme
confusion
and
said
in
a
submissive
tone
if
you
my
lord
can
wish
me
dead
i
can
not
though
your
heir
return
the
compliment
few
of
the
of
israel
he
added
recovering
himself
from
the
single
touch
of
emotion
he
had
displayed
can
say
so
much
with
truth
but
i
will
convince
you
ere
i
go
that
i
am
a
true
descendant
of
a
house
famed
for
its
memory
of
i
marvel
your
majesty
will
listen
to
him
longer
said
prince
charles
methinks
we
have
heard
enough
of
his
daring
but
james
who
took
the
interest
of
a
true
gossip
in
such
a
scene
as
was
now
passing
could
not
bear
to
cut
the
controversy
short
but
imposed
silence
on
his
son
with
whisht
baby
charles
there
is
a
good
bairn
whisht
i
want
to
hear
what
the
frontless
loon
can
only
sir
said
dalgarno
that
but
for
one
single
line
in
this
schedule
all
else
that
it
contains
could
not
have
bribed
me
to
take
that
woman
hand
into
that
line
maun
have
been
the
summa
totalis
said
the
king
not
so
sire
replied
dalgarno
the
sum
total
might
indeed
have
been
an
object
for
consideration
even
to
a
scottish
king
at
no
very
distant
period
but
it
would
have
had
little
charms
for
me
save
that
i
see
here
an
entry
which
gives
me
the
power
of
vengeance
over
the
family
of
glenvarloch
and
learn
from
it
that
yonder
pale
bride
when
she
put
the
into
my
hand
gave
me
the
power
of
burning
her
house
to
ashes
how
is
that
said
the
king
what
is
he
speaking
about
jingling
geordie
this
friendly
citizen
my
liege
said
lord
dalgarno
hath
expended
a
sum
belonging
to
my
lady
and
now
i
thank
heaven
to
me
in
acquiring
a
certain
mortgage
or
wanset
over
the
estate
of
glenvarloch
which
if
it
be
not
redeemed
before
at
noon
will
put
me
in
possession
of
the
fair
demesnes
of
those
who
once
called
themselves
our
can
this
be
true
said
the
king
it
is
even
but
too
true
please
your
majesty
answered
the
citizen
the
lady
hermione
having
advanced
the
money
for
the
original
creditor
i
was
obliged
in
honour
and
honesty
to
take
the
rights
to
her
and
doubtless
they
pass
to
her
but
the
warrant
man
said
the
king
the
warrant
on
our
exchequer
couldna
that
supply
the
lad
wi
the
means
of
redemption
unhappily
my
liege
he
has
lost
it
or
disposed
of
it
it
is
not
to
be
found
he
is
the
most
unlucky
youth
this
is
a
proper
spot
of
work
said
the
king
beginning
to
amble
about
and
play
with
the
points
of
his
doublet
and
hose
in
expression
of
dismay
we
can
not
aid
him
without
paying
our
debts
twice
over
and
we
have
in
the
present
state
of
our
exchequer
scarce
the
means
of
paying
them
you
have
told
me
news
said
lord
dalgarno
but
i
will
take
no
do
not
said
his
father
be
a
bold
villain
since
thou
must
be
one
and
seek
revenge
with
arms
and
not
with
the
usurer
pardon
me
my
lord
said
lord
dalgarno
pen
and
ink
are
now
my
surest
means
of
vengeance
and
more
land
is
won
by
the
lawyer
with
the
than
by
the
andrea
ferrara
with
his
sheepshead
handle
but
as
i
said
before
i
will
take
no
advantages
i
will
await
in
town
near
covent
garden
if
any
one
will
pay
the

my
scrivener
with
whom
the
deeds
lie
the
better
for
lord
glenvarloch
if
not
i
will
go
forward
on
the
next
day
and
travel
with
all
dispatch
to
the
north
to
take

a

with
you
unhappy
wretch
said
lord
huntinglen
and
a
king
who
is
said
james
i
trust
to
bear
both
lightly
said
lord
dalgarno
and
bowing
around
him
he
withdrew
while
all
present
oppressed
and
as
it
were
overawed
by
his
determined
effrontery
found
they
could
draw
breath
more
freely
when
he
at
length
relieved
them
of
his
society
lord
huntinglen
applying
himself
to
comfort
his
new

with
her

the

james
had
no
sooner
resumed
his
seat
at
the
than
he
began
to
hitch
in
his
chair
cough
use
his
handkerchief
and
make
other
intimations
that
he
meditated
a
long
speech
the
council

themselves
to
the
beseeming
degree

charles
as
strict
in
his
notions
of
decorum
as
his
father
was
indifferent
to
it
fixed
himself
in
an
attitude
of
rigid
and
respectful
attention
while
the
haughty
favourite
conscious
of
his
power
over
both
father
and
son
stretched
himself
more
easily
on
his
seat
and
in
assuming
an
appearance
of
listening
seemed
to
pay
a
debt
to
ceremonial
rather
than
to
duty
i
doubt
not
my
lords
said
the
monarch
that
some
of
you
may
be
thinking
the
hour
of
refection
is
past
and
that
it
is
time
to
ask
with
the
slave
in
the
comedy
de
symbolo
nevertheless
to
do
justice
and
exercise
judgment
is
our
meat
and
drink
and
now
we
are
to
pray
your
wisdom
to
consider
the
case
of
this
unhappy
youth
lord
glenvarloch
and
see
whether
consistently
with
our
honour
any
thing
can
be
done
in
his
i
am
surprised
at
your
majesty
wisdom
making
the
inquiry
said
the
duke
it
is
plain
this
dalgarno
hath
proved
one
of
the
most
insolent
villains
on
earth
and
it
must
therefore
be
clear
that
if
lord
glenvarloch
had
run
him
through
the
body
there
would
but
have
been
out
of
the
world
a
knave
who
had
lived
in
it
too
long
i
think
lord
glenvarloch
hath
had
much
wrong
and
i
regret
that
by
the
persuasions
of
this
false
fellow
i
have
myself
had
some
hand
in
ye
speak
like
a
child
steenie
i
mean
my
lord
of
buckingham
answered
the
king
and
as
one
that
does
not
understand
the
logic
of
the
schools
for
an
action
may
be
inconsequential
or
even
meritorious
that
is
as
touching
him
upon
it
is
acted
and
yet
most
criminal
or
considering
the
place
it
is
done
as
a
man
may
lawfully
dance
chrighty
beardie
or
any
other
dance
in
a
tavern
but
not
parietes
so
that
though
it
may
have
been
a
good
deed
to
have
sticked
lord
dalgarno
being
such
as
he
has
shown
himself
anywhere
else
yet
it
fell
under
the
plain
statute
when
violence
was
offered
within
the
verge
of
the
court
for
let
me
tell
you
my
lords
the
statute
against
striking
would
be
of
no
small
use
in
our
court
if
it
could
be
eluded
by
justifying
the
person
stricken
to
be
a
knave
it
is
much
to
be
lamented
that
i
ken
nae
court
in
christendom
where
knaves
are
not
to
be
found
and
if
men
are
to
break
the
peace
under
pretence
of
beating
them
why
it
will
rain
jeddart
staves
footnote
the
weapon
called
the
jeddart
staff
was
a
species
of
of
a
very
great
tempest
it
is
said
in
the
south
of
scotland
that
it
rains
jeddart
staffs
as
in
england
the
common
people
talk
of
its
raining
cats
and
dogs
in
our
very
what
your
majesty
says
replied
prince
charles
is
marked
with
your
usual
wisdom
the
precincts
of
palaces
must
be
sacred
as
well
as
the
persons
of
kings
which
are
respected
even
in
the
most
barbarous
nations
as
being
one
step
only
beneath
their
divinities
but
your
majesty
will
can
control
the
severity
of
this
and
every
other
law
and
it
is
in
your
power
on
consideration
of
his
case
to
grant
the
rash
young
man
a
free
acu
tetigisti
carole
mi
puerule
answered
the
king
and
know
my
lords
that
we
have
by
a
shrewd
device
and
gift
of
our
own
already
sounded
the
very
depth
of
this
lord
glenvarloch
disposition
i
trow
there
be
among
you
some
that
remember
my
handling
in
the
curious
case
of
my
lady
lake
and
how
i
trimmed
them
about
the
story
of
hearkening
behind
the
arras
now
this
put
me
to
cogitation
and
i
remembered
me
of
having
read
that
dionysius
king
of
syracuse
whom
historians
call
tyrannos
which
signifieth
not
in
the
greek
tongue
as
in
ours
a
truculent
usurper
but
a
royal
king
who
governs
it
may
be
something
more
strictly
than
we
and
other
lawful
monarchs
whom
the
ancients
termed
basileis
now
this
dionysius
of
syracuse
caused
cunning
workmen
to
build
for
himself
a
d
ken
what
that
is
my
lord
bishop
a
cathedral
i
presume
to
guess
answered
the
bishop
what
the
deil
man
i
crave
your
lordship
pardon
for
swearing
but
it
was
no
cathedral
only
a
called
the
king
or
where
he
could
sit
undescried
and
hear
the
converse
of
his
prisoners
now
sirs
in
imitation
of
this
dionysius
whom
i
took
for
my
pattern
the
rather
that
he
was
a
great
linguist
and
grammarian
and
taught
a
school
with
good
applause
after
his
abdication
either
he
or
his
successor
of
the
same
name
it
matters
not
whilk
i
have
caused
them
to
make
a
up
at
the
of
the
tower
yonder
more
like
a
pulpit
than
a
cathedral
my
lord
bishop
and
communicating
with
the
arras
behind
the
lieutenant
chamber
where
we
may
sit
and
privily
hear
the
discourse
of
such
prisoners
as
are
pent
up
there
for
and
so
creep
into
the
very
secrets
of
our
the
prince
cast
a
glance
towards
the
duke
expressive
of
great
vexation
and
disgust
buckingham
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
the
motion
was
so
slight
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
weel
my
lords
ye
ken
the
fray
at
the
hunting
this
morning
i
shall
not
get
out
of
the
trembling
exies
until
i
have
a
sound
sleep
just
after
that
they
bring
ye
in
a
pretty
page
that
had
been
found
in
the
park
we
were
warned
against
examining
him
ourselves
by
the
anxious
care
of
those
around
us
nevertheless
holding
our
life
ever
at
the
service
of
these
kingdoms
we
commanded
all
to
avoid
the
room
the
rather
that
we
suspected
this
boy
to
be
a
girl
what
think
ye
my
lords
few
of
you
would
have
thought
i
had
a
hawk
eye
for
sic
gear
but
we
thank
god
that
though
we
are
old
we
know
so
much
of
such
toys
as
may
beseem
a
man
of
decent
gravity
weel
my
lords
we
questioned
this
maiden
in
male
attire
ourselves
and
i
profess
it
was
a
very
pretty
interrogatory
and
well
followed
for
though
she
at
first
professed
that
she
assumed
this
disguise
in
order
to
countenance
the
woman
who
should
present
us
with
the
lady
hermione
petition
for
whom
she
professed
entire
affection
yet
when
we
suspecting
in
did
put
her
to
the
very
question
she
was
compelled
to
own
a
virtuous
attachment
for
glenvarlochides
in
such
a
pretty
passion
of
shame
and
fear
that
we
had
much
ado
to
keep
our
own
eyes
from
keeping
company
with
hers
in
weeping
also
she
laid
before
us
the
false
practices
of
this
dalgarno
towards
glenvarlochides
inveigling
him
into
houses
of
ill
resort
and
giving
him
evil
counsel
under
pretext
of
sincere
friendship
whereby
the
inexperienced
lad
was
led
to
do
what
was
prejudicial
to
himself
and
offensive
to
us
but
however
prettily
she
told
her
tale
we
determined
not
altogether
to
trust
to
her
narration
but
rather
to
try
the
experiment
whilk
we
had
devised
for
such
occasions
and
having
ourselves
speedily
passed
from
greenwich
to
the
tower
we
constituted
ourselves
eavesdropper
as
it
is
called
to
observe
what
should
pass
between
glenvarlochides
and
his
page
whom
we
caused
to
be
admitted
to
his
apartment
well
judging
that
if
they
were
of
counsel
together
to
deceive
us
it
could
not
be
but
something
of
it
would
spunk
out
and
what
think
ye
we
saw
my
lords
naething
for
you
to
sniggle
and
laugh
at
steenie
for
i
question
if
you
could
have
played
the
temperate
and
part
of
this
poor
lad
glenvarloch
he
might
be
a
father
of
the
church
in
comparison
of
you
and
then
to
try
his
patience
yet
farther
we
loosed
on
him
a
courtier
and
a
citizen
that
is
sir
mungo
malagrowther
and
our
servant
george
heriot
here
wha
dang
the
poor
lad
about
and
didna
greatly
spare
our
royal
you
mind
geordie
what
you
said
about
the
wives
and
concubines
but
i
forgie
ye
man
nae
need
of
kneeling
i
forgie
ye
the
readier
that
it
regards
a
certain
particular
whilk
as
it
added
not
much
to
solomon
credit
the
lack
of
it
can
not
be
said
to
impinge
on
ours
aweel
my
lords
for
all
temptation
of
sore
distress
and
evil
ensample
this
poor
lad
never
loosed
his
tongue
on
us
to
say
one
unbecoming
word
which
inclines
us
the
rather
acting
always
by
your
wise
advice
to
treat
this
affair
of
the
park
as
a
thing
done
in
the
heat
of
blood
and
under
strong
provocation
and
therefore
to
confer
our
free
pardon
on
lord
i
am
happy
your
gracious
majesty
said
the
duke
of
buckingham
has
arrived
at
that
conclusion
though
i
could
never
have
guessed
at
the
road
by
which
you
attained
i
trust
said
prince
charles
that
it
is
not
a
path
which
your
majesty
will
think
it
consistent
with
your
high
dignity
to
tread
never
while
i
live
again
baby
charles
that
i
give
you
my
royal
word
on
they
say
that
hearkeners
hear
ill
tales
of
themselves
by
my
saul
my
very
ears
are
tingling
wi
that
auld
sorrow
sir
mungo
sarcasms
he
called
us
steenie
i
am
sure
you
can
contradict
that
but
it
is
mere
envy
in
the
auld
mutilated
sinner
because
he
himself
has
neither
a
noble
to
hold
in
his
loof
nor
fingers
to
close
on
it
if
he
here
the
king
lost
recollection
of
sir
mungo
irreverence
in
chuckling
over
his
own
wit
and
only
farther
alluded
to
it
by
saying
we
must
give
the
old
maunderer
in
something
to
stop
his
mouth
or
he
will
rail
at
us
from
dan
to
and
now
my
lords
let
our
warrant
of
mercy
to
lord
glenvarloch
be
presently
expedited
and
he
put
to
his
freedom
and
as
his
estate
is
likely
to
go
so
sleaveless
a
gate
we
will
consider
what
means
of
favour
we
can
show
my
lords
i
wish
you
an
appetite
to
an
early
supper
for
our
labours
have
approached
that
baby
charles
and
steenie
you
will
remain
till
our
my
lord
bishop
you
will
be
pleased
to
stay
to
bless
our
geordie
heriot
a
word
with
you
his
majesty
then
drew
the
citizen
into
a
corner
while
the
counsellors
those
excepted
who
had
been
commanded
to
remain
made
their
obeisance
and
withdrew
geordie
said
the
king
my
good
and
trusty
servant
here
he
busied
his
fingers
much
with
the
points
and
ribbons
of
his
dress
ye
see
that
we
have
granted
from
our
own
natural
sense
of
right
and
justice
that
which
yon
fallow
moniplies
i
think
they
ca
him
proffered
to
purchase
from
us
with
a
mighty
bribe
whilk
we
refused
as
being
a
crowned
king
who
wad
neither
sell
our
justice
nor
our
mercy
for
pecuniar
consideration
now
what
think
ye
should
be
the
upshot
of
this
my
lord
glenvarloch
freedom
and
his
restoration
to
your
favour
said
heriot
i
ken
that
said
the
king
peevishly
ye
are
very
dull
i
mean
what
do
you
think
this
fallow
moniplies
should
think
about
the
matter
surely
that
your
majesty
is
a
most
good
and
gracious
sovereign
answered
heriot
we
had
need
to
be
gude
and
gracious
baith
said
the
king
still
more
pettishly
that
have
idiots
about
us
that
can
not
understand
what
we
mint
at
unless
we
speak
it
out
in
braid
lowlands
see
this
chield
moniplies
sir
and
tell
him
what
we
have
done
for
lord
glenvarloch
in
whom
he
takes
such
part
out
of
our
own
gracious
motion
though
we
refused
to
do
it
on
ony
proffer
of
private
advantage
now
you
may
put
it
till
him
as
if
of
your
own
mind
whether
it
will
be
a
gracious
or
a
dutiful
part
in
him
to
press
us
for
present
payment
of
the
two
or
three
hundred
miserable
pounds
for
whilk
we
were
obliged
to
opignorate
our
jewels
indeed
mony
men
may
think
ye
wad
do
the
part
of
a
good
citizen
if
you
took
it
on
yourself
to
refuse
him
payment
seeing
he
hath
had
what
he
professed
to
esteem
full
satisfaction
and
considering
moreover
that
it
is
evident
he
hath
no
pressing
need
of
the
money
whereof
we
have
much
george
heriot
sighed
internally
o
my
master
thought
he
my
dear
master
is
it
then
fated
you
are
never
to
indulge
any
kingly
or
noble
sentiment
without
its
being
sullied
by
some
afterthought
of
interested
selfishness
the
king
troubled
himself
not
about
what
he
thought
but
taking
him
by
the
collar
said
ye
ken
my
meaning
now
jingler
awa
wi
ye
you
are
a
wise
man
manage
it
your
ain
gate
but
forget
not
our
present
the
citizen
made
his
obeisance
and
withdrew
and
now
bairns
said
the
king
what
do
you
look
upon
each
other
for
and
what
have
you
got
to
ask
of
your
dear
dad
and
gossip
only
said
the
prince
that
it
would
please
your
majesty
to
command
the
at
the
prison
to
be
presently
built
up
the
groans
of
a
captive
should
not
be
brought
in
evidence
against
what
build
up
my
lugg
baby
charles
and
yet
better
deaf
than
hear
ill
tales
of
oneself
so
let
them
build
it
up
hard
and
fast
without
delay
the
rather
that
my
back
is
sair
with
sitting
in
it
for
a
whole
and
now
let
us
see
what
the
cooks
have
been
doing
for
us
bonny
chapter
xxxiv
to
this
brave
man
the
knight
repairs
for
counsel
in
his
law
affairs
and
found
him
mounted
in
his
pew
with
books
and
money
placed
for
show
like
to
make
clients
lay
and
for
his
false
opinion
pay
our
readers
may
recollect
a
certain
scottish
scrivener
who
in
the
earlier
part
of
this
history
appeared
in
the
character
of
a
protege
of
george
heriot
it
is
to
his
house
we
are
about
to
remove
but
times
have
changed
with
him
the
petty
booth
hath
become
a
chamber
of
importance
the
buckram
suit
is
changed
into
black
velvet
and
although
the
wearer
retains
his
puritanical
humility
and
politeness
to
clients
of
consequence
he
can
now
look
others
broad
in
the
face
and
treat
them
with
a
full
allowance
of
superior
opulence
and
the
insolence
arising
from
it
it
was
but
a
short
period
that
had
achieved
these
alterations
nor
was
the
party
himself
as
yet
entirely
accustomed
to
them
but
the
change
was
becoming
less
embarrassing
to
him
with
every
day
practice
among
other
acquisitions
of
wealth
you
may
see
one
of
davy
ramsay
best
timepieces
on
the
table
and
his
eye
is
frequently
observing
its
revolutions
while
a
boy
whom
he
employs
as
a
scribe
is
occasionally
sent
out
to
compare
its
progress
with
the
clock
of
saint
dunstan
the
scrivener
himself
seemed
considerably
agitated
he
took
from
a
a
bundle
of
parchments
and
read
passages
of
them
with
great
attention
then
began
to
soliloquize
there
is
no
outlet
which
law
can
suggest
no
of
evasion
none
if
the
lands
of
glenvarloch
are
not
redeemed
before
it
rings
noon
lord
dalgarno
has
them
a
cheap
pennyworth
strange
that
he
should
have
been
at
last
able
to
set
his
patron
at
defiance
and
achieve
for
himself
the
fair
estate
with
the
prospect
of
which
he
so
long
flattered
the
powerful
might
not
andrew
skurliewhitter
nick
him
as
neatly
he
hath
been
my
patron
true
not
more
than
buckingham
was
his
and
he
can
be
so
no
more
for
he
departs
presently
for
scotland
i
am
glad
of
it
i
hate
him
and
i
fear
him
he
knows
too
many
of
my
secrets
i
know
too
many
of
his
but
no
no
no
i
need
never
attempt
it
there
are
no
means
of
well
willie
what
hours
just
chappit
go
to
your
desk
without
child
said
the
scrivener
what
to
do
next
i
shall
lose
the
old
earl
fair
business
and
what
is
worse
his
son
foul
practice
old
heriot
looks
too
close
into
business
to
permit
me
more
than
the
paltry
and
ordinary
dues
the
whitefriars
business
was
profitable
but
it
has
become
unsafe
ever
since
pah
what
brought
that
in
my
head
just
now
i
can
hardly
hold
my
pen
if
men
should
see
me
in
this
way
willie
calling
aloud
to
the
boy
a
cup
of
distilled
waters
soh
now
i
could
face
the
he
spoke
the
last
words
aloud
and
close
by
the
door
of
the
apartment
which
was
suddenly
opened
by
richie
moniplies
followed
by
two
gentlemen
and
attended
by
two
porters
bearing
if
ye
can
face
the
devil
maister
skurliewhitter
said
richie
ye
will
be
the
less
likely
to
turn
your
back
on
a
sack
or
twa
o
siller
which
i
have
the
freedom
to
bring
you
sathanas
and
mammon
are
near
the
porters
at
the
same
time
ranged
their
load
on
the
floor
i
i
stammered
the
surprised
scrivener
i
can
not
guess
what
you
mean
only
that
i
have
brought
you
the
on
the
part
of
lord
glenvarloch
in
discharge
of
a
certain
mortgage
over
his
family
inheritance
and
here
in
good
time
comes
master
reginald
lowestoffe
and
another
honourable
gentleman
of
the
temple
to
be
witnesses
to
the
i
i
incline
to
think
said
the
scrivener
that
the
term
is
you
will
pardon
us
master
scrivener
said
lowestoffe
you
will
not
baffle
us
it
wants
of
noon
by
every
clock
in
the
i
must
have
time
gentlemen
said
andrew
to
examine
the
gold
by
tale
and
do
so
at
your
leisure
master
scrivener
replied
lowestoffe
again
we
have
already
seen
the
contents
of
each
sack
told
and
weighed
and
we
have
put
our
seals
on
them
there
they
stand
in
a
row
twenty
in
number
each
containing
three
hundred
we
are
witnesses
to
the
lawful
gentlemen
said
the
scrivener
this
security
now
belongs
to
a
mighty
lord
i
pray
you
abate
your
haste
and
let
me
send
for
lord
dalgarno
or
rather
i
will
run
for
him
so
saying
he
took
up
his
hat
but
lowestoffe
called
out
friend
moniplies
keep
the
door
fast
an
thou
a
man
he
seeks
but
to
put
off
the
in
plain
terms
andrew
you
may
send
for
the
devil
if
you
will
who
is
the
mightiest
lord
of
my
acquaintance
but
from
hence
you
stir
not
till
you
have
answered
our
proposition
by
rejecting
or
accepting
the
fairly
tendered
there
it
lies
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
will
i
have
skill
enough
to
know
that
the
law
is
mightier
than
any
lord
in
britain
i
have
learned
so
much
at
the
temple
if
i
have
learned
nothing
else
and
see
that
you
trifle
not
with
it
lest
it
make
your
long
ears
an
inch
shorter
master
nay
gentlemen
if
you
threaten
me
said
the
scrivener
i
can
not
resist
no
threats
no
threats
at
all
my
little
andrew
said
lowestoffe
a
little
friendly
advice
only
forget
not
honest
andrew
i
have
seen
you
in
without
answering
a
single
word
the
scrivener
sat
down
and
drew
in
proper
form
a
full
receipt
for
the
money
proffered
i
take
it
on
your
report
master
lowestoffe
he
said
i
hope
you
will
remember
i
have
insisted
neither
upon
weight
nor
tale
i
have
been
civil
if
there
is
deficiency
i
shall
come
to
fillip
his
nose
with
a
richie
quoth
the
templar
take
up
the
papers
and
now
wend
we
merrily
to
dine
thou
if
i
might
choose
said
richie
it
should
not
be
at
yonder
roguish
ordinary
but
as
it
is
your
pleasure
gentlemen
the
treat
shall
be
given
wheresoever
you
will
have
at
the
ordinary
said
the
one
templar
at
beaujeu
said
the
other
it
is
the
only
house
in
london
for
neat
wines
nimble
drawers
choice
dishes
and
and
high
charges
quoth
richie
moniplies
but
as
i
said
before
gentlemen
ye
have
a
right
to
command
me
in
this
thing
having
so
frankly
rendered
me
your
service
in
this
small
matter
of
business
without
other
stipulation
than
that
of
a
slight
the
latter
part
of
this
discourse
passed
in
the
street
where
immediately
afterwards
they
met
lord
dalgarno
he
appeared
in
haste
touched
his
hat
slightly
to
master
lowestoffe
who
returned
his
reverence
with
the
same
negligence
and
walked
slowly
on
with
his
companion
while
lord
dalgarno
stopped
richie
moniplies
with
a
commanding
sign
which
the
instinct
of
education
compelled
moniplies
though
indignant
to
obey
whom
do
you
now
follow
sirrah
demanded
the
noble
whomsoever
goeth
before
me
my
lord
answered
moniplies
no
sauciness
you
knave
i
desire
to
know
if
you
still
serve
nigel
olifaunt
said
dalgarno
i
am
friend
to
the
noble
lord
glenvarloch
answered
moniplies
with
dignity
true
replied
lord
dalgarno
that
noble
lord
has
sunk
to
seek
friends
among
lackeys
nevertheless
hark
thee
hither
nevertheless
if
he
be
of
the
same
mind
as
when
we
last
met
thou
mayst
show
him
that
on
at
four
afternoon
i
shall
pass
northward
by
enfield
chase
i
will
be
slenderly
attended
as
i
design
to
send
my
train
through
barnet
it
is
my
purpose
to
ride
an
easy
pace
through
the
forest
and
to
linger
a
while
by
camlet
moat
he
knows
the
place
and
if
he
be
aught
but
an
alsatian
bully
will
think
it
fitter
for
some
purposes
than
the
park
he
is
i
understand
at
liberty
or
shortly
to
be
so
if
he
fail
me
at
the
place
nominated
he
must
seek
me
in
scotland
where
he
will
find
me
possessed
of
his
father
estate
and
humph
muttered
richie
there
go
twa
words
to
that
he
even
meditated
a
joke
on
the
means
which
he
was
conscious
he
possessed
of
baffling
lord
dalgarno
expectations
but
there
was
something
of
keen
and
dangerous
excitement
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
nobleman
which
prompted
his
discretion
for
once
to
rule
his
vit
and
he
only
answered
god
grant
your
lordship
may
well
brook
your
new
conquest
when
you
get
it
i
shall
do
your
errand
to
my
lord
whilk
is
to
say
he
added
internally
he
shall
never
hear
a
word
of
it
from
richie
i
am
not
the
lad
to
put
him
in
such
lord
dalgarno
looked
at
him
sharply
for
a
moment
as
if
to
penetrate
the
meaning
of
the
dry
ironical
tone
which
in
spite
of
richie
awe
mingled
with
his
answer
and
then
waved
his
hand
in
signal
he
should
pass
on
he
himself
walked
slowly
till
the
trio
were
out
of
sight
then
turned
back
with
hasty
steps
to
the
door
of
the
scrivener
which
he
had
passed
in
his
progress
knocked
and
was
admitted
lord
dalgarno
found
the
man
of
law
with
the
still
standing
before
him
and
it
escaped
not
his
penetrating
glance
that
skurliewhitter
was
disconcerted
and
alarmed
at
his
approach
how
now
man
he
said
what
hast
thou
not
a
word
of
oily
compliment
to
me
on
my
happy
marriage
not
a
word
of
most
philosophical
consolation
on
my
disgrace
at
court
or
has
my
mien
as
a
wittol
and
discarded
favourite
the
properties
of
the
gorgon
head
the
palladis
as
majesty
might
say
my
lord
i
am
glad
my
lord
i
am
sorry
answered
the
trembling
scrivener
who
aware
of
the
vivacity
of
lord
dalgarno
temper
dreaded
the
consequence
of
the
communication
he
had
to
make
to
him
glad
and
sorry
answered
lord
dalgarno
that
is
blowing
hot
and
cold
with
a
witness
hark
ye
you
picture
of
personified
if
you
are
sorry
i
am
a
cuckold
remember
i
am
only
mine
own
you
knave
there
is
too
little
blood
in
her
cheeks
to
have
sent
her
astray
elsewhere
well
i
will
bear
mine
antler
honours
as
i
may
gold
shall
gild
them
and
for
my
disgrace
revenge
shall
sweeten
it
ay
revenge
and
there
strikes
the
happy
hour
the
hour
of
noon
was
accordingly
heard
to
peal
from
saint
dunstan
well
banged
brave
hammers
said
lord
dalgarno
in
the
estate
and
lands
of
glenvarloch
are
crushed
beneath
these
clanging
blows
if
my
steel
prove
but
as
true
as
your
iron
maces
the
poor
landless
lord
will
little
miss
what
your
peal
hath
cut
him
out
the
papers
the
papers
thou
varlet
i
am
northward
ho
at
four
afternoon
i
am
bound
to
be
at
camlet
moat
in
the
enfield
chase
most
of
my
retinue
set
forward
the
papers
come
my
lord
the
the
papers
of
the
glenvarloch
mortgage
i
i
have
them
have
them
not
echoed
lord
dalgarno
hast
thou
sent
them
to
my
lodgings
thou
varlet
did
i
not
say
i
was
coming
hither
what
mean
you
by
pointing
to
that
money
what
villainy
have
you
done
for
it
it
is
too
large
to
be
come
honestly
your
lordship
knows
best
answered
the
scrivener
in
great
perturbation
the
gold
is
your
own
it
is
it
is
not
the
of
the
glenvarloch
estate
said
dalgarno
dare
not
say
it
is
or
i
will
upon
the
spot
divorce
your
pettifogging
soul
from
your
carrion
carcass
so
saying
he
seized
the
scrivener
by
the
collar
and
shook
him
so
vehemently
that
he
tore
it
from
the
cassock
my
lord
i
must
call
for
help
said
the
trembling
caitiff
who
felt
at
that
moment
all
the
bitterness
of
the
mortal
agony
it
was
the
act
not
mine
what
could
i
do
dost
ask
why
thou
snivelling
dribblet
of
damnation
were
all
thy
oaths
tricks
and
lies
spent
or
do
you
hold
yourself
too
good
to
utter
them
in
my
service
thou
shouldst
have
lied
cozened
truth
itself
rather
than
stood
betwixt
me
and
my
revenge
but
mark
me
he
continued
i
know
more
of
your
pranks
than
would
hang
thee
a
line
from
me
to
the
and
thou
art
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
my
lord
said
the
scrivener
all
that
art
and
law
can
accomplish
i
will
ah
are
you
converted
do
so
or
pity
of
your
life
said
the
lord
and
remember
i
never
fail
my
then
keep
that
accursed
gold
he
continued
or
stay
i
will
not
trust
you
send
me
this
gold
home
presently
to
my
lodging
i
will
still
forward
to
scotland
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
that
i
hold
out
glenvarloch
castle
against
the
owner
by
means
of
the
ammunition
he
has
himself
furnished
thou
art
ready
to
serve
me
the
scrivener
professed
the
most
implicit
obedience
then
remember
the
hour
was
past
ere
payment
was
tendered
and
see
thou
hast
witnesses
of
trusty
memory
to
prove
that
tush
my
lord
i
will
do
more
said
andrew
reviving
i
will
prove
that
lord
glenvarloch
friends
threatened
swaggered
and
drew
swords
on
did
your
lordship
think
i
was
ungrateful
enough
to
have
suffered
them
to
prejudice
your
lordship
save
that
they
had
bare
swords
at
my
throat
enough
said
replied
dalgarno
you
are
perfect
mind
that
you
continue
so
as
you
would
avoid
my
fury
i
leave
my
page
below
get
porters
and
let
them
follow
me
instantly
with
the
so
saying
lord
dalgarno
left
the
scrivener
habitation
skurliewhitter
having
dispatched
his
boy
to
get
porters
of
trust
for
transporting
the
money
remained
alone
and
in
dismay
meditating
by
what
means
he
could
shake
himself
free
of
the
vindictive
and
ferocious
nobleman
who
possessed
at
once
a
dangerous
knowledge
of
his
character
and
the
power
of
exposing
him
where
exposure
would
be
ruin
he
had
indeed
acquiesced
in
the
plan
rapidly
sketched
for
obtaining
possession
of
the
ransomed
estate
but
his
experience
foresaw
that
this
would
be
impossible
while
on
the
other
hand
he
could
not
anticipate
the
various
consequences
of
lord
dalgarno
resentment
without
fears
from
which
his
sordid
soul
recoiled
to
be
in
the
power
and
subject
both
to
the
humours
and
the
extortions
of
a
spendthrift
young
lord
just
when
his
industry
had
shaped
out
the
means
of
fortune
it
was
the
most
cruel
trick
which
fate
could
have
played
the
incipient
usurer
while
the
scrivener
was
in
this
fit
of
anxious
anticipation
one
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
apartment
and
being
desired
to
enter
appeared
in
the
coarse
of
uncut
wiltshire
cloth
fastened
by
a
broad
leather
belt
and
brass
buckle
which
was
then
generally
worn
by
graziers
and
countrymen
skurliewhitter
believing
he
saw
in
his
visitor
a
country
client
who
might
prove
profitable
had
opened
his
mouth
to
request
him
to
be
seated
when
the
stranger
throwing
back
his
frieze
hood
which
he
had
drawn
over
his
face
showed
the
scrivener
features
well
imprinted
in
his
recollection
but
which
he
never
saw
without
a
disposition
to
swoon
is
it
you
he
said
faintly
as
the
stranger
replaced
the
hood
which
concealed
his
features
who
else
should
it
be
said
his
visitor
thou
son
of
parchment
got
betwixt
the
inkhorn
and
the
that
mayest
call
the
pen
thy
father
and
the
ink
thy
mother
the
wax
thy
brother
and
the
sand
thy
sister
and
the
good
pillory
thy
cousin
allied
rise
and
do
reverence
unto
me
thy
better
not
yet
down
to
the
country
said
the
scrivener
after
every
warning
do
not
think
your
grazier
cloak
will
bear
you
out
captain
no
nor
your
scraps
of
why
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
said
the
captain
would
you
have
me
starve
if
i
am
to
fly
you
must
eke
my
wings
with
a
few
feathers
you
can
spare
them
i
you
had
means
already
you
have
had
ten
pieces
what
is
become
of
them
gone
answered
captain
colepepper
gone
no
matter
where
i
had
a
mind
to
bite
and
i
was
bitten
that
all
i
think
my
hand
shook
at
the
thought
of
night
work
for
i
trowled
the
doctors
like
a
very
and
you
have
lost
all
then
well
take
this
and
be
gone
said
the
scrivener
what
two
poor
smelts
marry
plague
of
your
bounty
but
remember
you
are
as
deep
in
as
not
so
by
heaven
answered
the
scrivener
i
only
thought
of
easing
the
old
man
of
some
papers
and
a
trifle
of
his
gold
and
you
took
his
were
he
living
answered
colepepper
he
would
rather
have
lost
it
than
his
but
that
is
not
the
question
master
skurliewhitter
you
undid
the
private
bolts
of
the
window
when
you
visited
him
about
some
affairs
on
the
day
ere
he
died
so
satisfy
yourself
that
if
i
am
taken
i
will
not
swing
alone
pity
jack
hempsfield
is
dead
it
spoils
the
old
catch
three
merry
men
and
three
merry
men
and
three
merry
men
are
we
as
ever
did
sing
three
parts
in
a
string
all
under
the
triple
tree
for
god
sake
speak
lower
said
the
scrivener
is
this
a
place
or
time
to
make
your
midnight
catches
heard
but
how
much
will
serve
your
turn
i
tell
you
i
am
but
ill
you
tell
me
a
lie
then
said
the
bully
a
most
palpable
and
gross
how
much
d
say
will
serve
my
turn
why
one
of
these
bags
will
do
for
the
i
swear
to
you
that
these
bags
of
money
are
not
at
my
not
honestly
perhaps
said
the
captain
but
that
makes
little
difference
betwixt
i
swear
to
you
continued
the
scrivener
they
are
in
no
way
at
my
disposal
they
have
been
delivered
to
me
by
tale
i
am
to
pay
them
over
to
lord
dalgarno
whose
boy
waits
for
them
and
i
could
not
skelder
one
piece
out
of
them
without
risk
of
hue
and
can
you
not
put
off
the
delivery
said
the
bravo
his
huge
hand
still
fumbling
with
one
of
the
bags
as
if
his
fingers
longed
to
close
on
it
impossible
said
the
scrivener
he
sets
forward
to
scotland
ay
said
the
bully
after
a
moment
thought
travels
he
the
north
road
with
such
a
charge
he
is
well
accompanied
added
the
scrivener
but
yet
but
yet
but
what
said
the
bravo
nay
i
meant
nothing
said
the
scrivener
thou
didst
thou
hadst
the
wind
of
some
good
thing
replied
colepepper
i
saw
thee
pause
like
a
setting
dog
thou
wilt
say
as
little
and
make
as
sure
a
sign
as
a
all
i
meant
to
say
captain
was
that
his
servants
go
by
barnet
and
he
himself
with
his
page
pass
through
enfield
chase
and
he
spoke
to
me
yesterday
of
riding
a
soft
aha
comest
thou
to
me
there
my
boy
and
of
resting
continued
the
scrivener
resting
a
space
at
camlet
why
this
is
better
than
said
the
captain
i
see
not
how
it
can
advantage
you
captain
said
the
scrivener
but
however
they
can
not
ride
fast
for
his
page
rides
the
which
carries
all
that
weight
pointing
to
the
money
on
the
table
lord
dalgarno
looks
sharp
to
the
world
that
horse
will
be
obliged
to
those
who
may
ease
him
of
his
burden
said
the
bravo
and
egad
he
may
be
met
he
hath
still
that
page
that
same
lutin
that
goblin
well
the
boy
hath
set
game
for
me
ere
now
i
will
be
revenged
too
for
i
owe
him
a
grudge
for
an
old
score
at
the
ordinary
let
me
see
black
feltham
and
dick
shakebag
we
shall
want
a
fourth
i
love
to
make
sure
and
the
booty
will
stand
parting
besides
what
i
can
bucket
them
out
of
well
scrivener
lend
me
two
bravely
done
nobly
imparted
give
ye
and
wrapping
his
disguise
closer
around
him
away
he
went
when
he
had
left
the
room
the
scrivener
wrung
his
hands
and
exclaimed
more
blood
more
blood
i
thought
to
have
had
done
with
it
but
this
time
there
was
no
fault
with
me
none
and
then
i
shall
have
all
the
advantage
if
this
ruffian
falls
there
is
truce
with
his
tugs
at
my
and
if
lord
dalgarno
dies
as
is
most
likely
for
though
as
much
afraid
of
cold
steel
as
a
debtor
of
a
dun
this
fellow
is
a
deadly
shot
from
behind
a
bush
then
am
i
in
a
thousand
ways
safe
safe
we
willingly
drop
the
curtain
over
him
and
his
reflections
chapter
xxxv
we
are
not
worst
at
once
the
course
of
evil
begins
so
slowly
and
from
such
slight
source
an
infant
hand
might
stem
its
breach
with
clay
but
let
the
stream
get
deeper
and
philosophy
ay
and
religion
too
shall
strive
in
vain
to
turn
the
headlong
torrent
the
templars
had
been
regaled
by
our
friend
richie
moniplies
in
a
private
chamber
at
beaujeu
where
he
might
be
considered
as
good
company
for
he
had
exchanged
his
cloak
and
jerkin
for
a
grave
yet
handsome
suit
of
clothes
in
the
fashion
of
the
times
but
such
as
might
have
befitted
an
older
man
than
himself
he
had
positively
declined
presenting
himself
at
the
ordinary
a
point
to
which
his
companions
were
very
desirous
to
have
brought
him
for
it
will
be
easily
believed
that
such
wags
as
lowestoffe
and
his
companion
were
not
indisposed
to
a
little
merriment
at
the
expense
of
the
raw
and
pedantic
scotsman
besides
the
chance
of
easing
him
of
a
few
pieces
of
which
he
appeared
to
have
acquired
considerable
command
but
not
even
a
succession
of
measures
of
sparkling
sack
in
which
the
little
brilliant
atoms
circulated
like
motes
in
the
sun
rays
had
the
least
effect
on
richie
sense
of
decorum
he
retained
the
gravity
of
a
judge
even
while
he
drank
like
a
fish
partly
from
his
own
natural
inclination
to
good
liquor
partly
in
the
way
of
good
fellowship
towards
his
guests
when
the
wine
began
to
make
some
innovation
on
their
heads
master
lowestoffe
tired
perhaps
of
the
humours
of
richie
who
began
to
become
yet
more
stoically
contradictory
and
dogmatical
than
even
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
entertainment
proposed
to
his
friend
to
break
up
their
debauch
and
join
the
gamesters
the
drawer
was
called
accordingly
and
richie
discharged
the
reckoning
of
the
party
with
a
generous
remuneration
to
the
attendants
which
was
received
with
cap
and
knee
and
many
assurances
of
kindly
welcome
i
grieve
we
should
part
so
soon
gentlemen
said
richie
to
his
companions
and
i
would
you
had
cracked
another
quart
ere
you
went
or
stayed
to
take
some
slight
matter
of
supper
and
a
glass
of
rhenish
i
thank
you
however
for
having
graced
my
poor
collation
thus
far
and
i
commend
you
to
fortune
in
your
own
courses
for
the
ordinary
neither
was
is
nor
shall
be
an
element
of
fare
thee
well
then
said
lowestoffe
most
sapient
and
sententious
master
moniplies
may
you
soon
have
another
mortgage
to
redeem
and
may
i
be
there
to
witness
it
and
may
you
play
the
good
fellow
as
heartily
as
you
have
done
this
nay
gentlemen
it
is
merely
of
your
grace
to
say
so
but
if
you
would
but
hear
me
speak
a
few
words
of
admonition
respecting
this
wicked
ordinary
reserve
the
lesson
most
honourable
richie
said
lowestoffe
until
i
have
lost
all
my
money
showing
at
the
same
time
a
purse
indifferently
well
provided
and
then
the
lecture
is
likely
to
have
some
and
keep
my
share
of
it
richie
said
the
other
templar
showing
an
almost
empty
purse
in
his
turn
till
this
be
full
again
and
then
i
will
promise
to
hear
you
with
some
ay
ay
gallants

not
many
steps
from
the

when
a
person
whom
lost
in
his
reflections
on
gaming
ordinaries
and
the
manners
of
the
age
he
had
not
observed
and
who
had
been
as
negligent
on
his
part
ran
full
against
him
and
when
richie
desired
to
know
whether
he
meant
ony
incivility
replied
by
a
curse
on
scotland
and
all
that
belonged
to
it
a
less
round
reflection
on
his
country
would
at
any
time
have
provoked
richie
but
more
especially
when
he
had
a
double
quart
of
canary
and
better
in
his
pate
he
was
about
to
give
a
very
rough
answer
and
to
second
his
word
by
action
when
a
closer
view
of
his
antagonist
changed
his
purpose
you

the
vera
lad
in
the
warld
said
richie
whom
i
most
wished
to
and
you

beggarly
countrymen

the
last
sight
i
should
ever
wish
to
see
you
scots

ever
fair
and
false
and
an
honest
man
can
not
thrive
within
eyeshot
of
as
to
our
poverty
friend
replied
richie
that
is
as
heaven
pleases
but
touching
our
falset
i
prove
to
you
that
a
scotsman
bears
as
leal
and
true
a
heart
to
his
friend
as
ever
beat
in
english
i
care
not
whether
he
does
or
not
said
the
gallant
let
me
go
why
keep
you
hold
of
my
cloak
let
me
go
or
i
will
thrust
you
into
the
i
believe
i
could
forgie
ye
for
you
did
me
a
good
turn
once
in
plucking
me
out
of
it
said
the
scot
beshrew
my
fingers
then
if
they
did
so
replied
the
stranger
i
would
your
whole
country
lay
there
along
with
you
and
heaven
curse
blight
the
hand
that
helped
to
raise
them
why
do
you
stop
my
way
he
added
fiercely
because
it
is
a
bad
one
master
jenkin
said
richie
nay
never
start
about
it
man
you
see
you
are
known
that
an
honest
son
should
live
to
start
at
hearing
himself
called
by
his
own
name
jenkin
struck
his
brow
violently
with
his
clenched
fist
come
come
said
richie
this
passion
availeth
nothing
tell
me
what
gate
go

to
the
devil
answered
jin
vin
that
is
a
black
gate
if
you
speak
according
to
the
letter
answered
richie
but
if
metaphorically
there
are
worse
places
in
this
great
city
than
the
devil
tavern
and
i
care
not
if
i
go
thither
with
you
and
bestow
a
pottle
of
burnt
sack
on
you
it
will
correct
the
crudities
of
my
stomach
and
form
a
gentle
preparative
for
the
leg
of
a
cold
i
pray
you
in
good
fashion
to
let
me
go
said
jenkin
you
may
mean
me
kindly
and
i
wish
you
to
have
no
wrong
at
my
hand
but
i
am
in
the
humour
to
be
dangerous
to
myself
or
any
i
will
abide
the
risk
said
the
scot
if
you
will
but
come
with
me
and
here
is
a
place
convenient
a
howff
nearer
than
the
devil
whilk
is
but
an
drouthy
name
for
a
tavern
this
other
of
the
saint
andrew
is
a
quiet
place
where
i
have
my
whetter
now
and
then
when
i
lodged
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
temple
with
lord
what
the
deil
the

wi
the

garr
him
gie
sic
a
spang
as
that
and
almaist
brought
himself
and
me
on
the
causeway
do
not
name
that
false
scot
name
to
me
said
jin
vin
if
you
would
not
have
me
go
mad
i
was
happy
before
i
saw
him
he
has
been
the
cause
of
all
the
ill
that
has
befallen
me
he
has
made
a
knave
and
a
madman
of
me
if
you
are
a
knave
said
richie
you
have
met
an
officer
if
you
are
daft
you
have
met
a
keeper
but
a
gentle
officer
and
a
kind
keeper
look
you
my
gude
friend
there
has
been
twenty
things
said
about
this
same
lord
in
which
there
is
no
more
truth
than
in
the
leasings
of
mahound
the
warst
they
can
say
of
him
is
that
he
is
not
always
so
amenable
to
good
advice
as
i
would
pray
him
you
and
every
young
man
to
be
come
wi
me
just
come
ye
wi
me
and
if
a
little
spell
of
siller
and
a
great
deal
of
excellent
counsel
can
relieve
your
occasions
all
i
can
say
is
you
have
had
the
luck
to
meet
one
capable
of
giving
you
both
and
maist
willing
to
bestow
the
pertinacity
of
the
scot
prevailed
over
the
sullenness
of
vincent
who
was
indeed
in
a
state
of
agitation
and
incapacity
to
think
for
himself
which
led
him
to
yield
the
more
readily
to
the
suggestions
of
another
he
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
into
the
small
tavern
which
richie
recommended
and
where
they
soon
found
themselves
seated
in
a
snug
niche
with
a
reeking
pottle
of
burnt
sack
and
a
paper
of
sugar
betwixt
them
pipes
and
tobacco
were
also
provided
but
were
only
used
by
richie
who
had
adopted
the
custom
of
late
as
adding
considerably
to
the
gravity
and
importance
of
his
manner
and
affording
as
it
were
a
bland
and
pleasant
accompaniment
to
the
words
of
wisdom
which
flowed
from
his
tongue
after
they
had
filled
their
glasses
and
drank
them
in
silence
richie
repeated
the
question
whither
his
guest
was
going
when
they
met
so
fortunately
i
told
you
said
jenkin
i
was
going
to
destruction
i
mean
to
the
i
am
resolved
to
hazard
these
two
or
three
pieces
to
get
as
much
as
will
pay
for
a
passage
with
captain
sharker
whose
ship
lies
at
gravesend
bound
for
america
and
so
eastward
ho
i
met
one
devil
in
the
way
already
who
would
have
tempted
me
from
my
purpose
but
i
spurned
him
from
me
you
may
be
another
for
what
i
what
degree
of
damnation
do
you
propose
for
me
he
added
wildly
and
what
is
the
price
of
it
i
would
have
you
to
know
answered
richie
that
i
deal
in
no
such
commodities
whether
as
buyer
or
seller
but
if
you
will
tell
me
honestly
the
cause
of
your
distress
i
will
do
what
is
in
my
power
to
help
you
out
of
it
not
being
however
prodigal
of
promises
until
i
know
the
case
as
a
learned
physician
only
gives
advice
when
he
has
observed
the
no
one
has
any
thing
to
do
with
my
affairs
said
the
poor
lad
and
folding
his
arms
on
the
table
he
laid
his
head
upon
them
with
the
sullen
dejection
of
the
overburdened
lama
when
it
throws
itself
down
to
die
in
desperation
richard
moniplies
like
most
folk
who
have
a
good
opinion
of
themselves
was
fond
of
the
task
of
consolation
which
at
once
displayed
his
superiority
for
the
consoler
is
necessarily
for
the
time
at
least
superior
to
the
afflicted
person
and
indulged
his
love
of
talking
he
inflicted
on
the
poor
penitenta
harangue
of
pitiless
length
stuffed
full
of
the
usual
topics
of
the
mutability
of
human
affairs
the
eminent
advantages
of
patience
under
affliction
the
folly
of
grieving
for
what
hath
no
remedy
the
necessity
of
taking
more
care
for
the
future
and
some
gentle
rebukes
on
account
of
the
past
which
acid
he
threw
in
to
assist
in
subduing
the
patient
obstinacy
as
hannibal
used
vinegar
in
cutting
his
way
through
rocks
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
endure
this
flood
of
commonplace
eloquence
in
silence
and
jin
vin
whether
desirous
of
stopping
the
flow
of
words
crammed
thus
into
his
ear
against
the
stomach
of
his
sense
or
whether
confiding
in
richie
protestations
of
friendship
which
the
wretched
says
fielding
are
ever
so
ready
to
believe
or
whether
merely
to
give
his
sorrows
vent
in
words
raised
his
head
and
turning
his
red
and
swollen
eyes
to
richie
cocksbones
man
only
hold
thy
tongue
and
thou
shall
know
all
about
it
and
then
all
i
ask
of
thee
is
to
shake
hands
and
this
margaret
ramsay
you
have
seen
her
man
once
said
richie
once
at
master
george
heriot
in
lombard
street
i
was
in
the
room
when
they
ay
you
helped
to
shift
their
trenchers
i
remember
said
jin
vin
well
that
same
pretty
girl
and
i
will
uphold
her
the
prettiest
betwixt
paul
and
the
bar
she
is
to
be
wedded
to
your
lord
glenvarloch
with
a
pestilence
on
him
that
is
impossible
said
richie
it
is
raving
nonsense
man
they
make
april
gouks
of
you
cockneys
every
month
in
the
year
the
lord
glenvarloch
marry
the
daughter
of
a
lonnon
mechanic
i
would
as
soon
believe
the
great
prester
john
would
marry
the
daughter
of
a
jew
hark
ye
brother
said
jin
vin
i
will
allow
no
one
to
speak
disregardfully
of
the
city
for
all
i
am
in
i
crave
your
pardon
man
i
meant
no
offence
said
richie
but
as
to
the
marriage
it
is
a
thing
simply
it
is
a
thing
that
will
take
place
though
for
the
duke
and
the
prince
and
all
of
them
have
a
finger
in
it
and
especially
the
old
fool
of
a
king
that
makes
her
out
to
be
some
great
woman
in
her
own
country
as
all
the
scots
pretend
to
be
you
master
vincent
but
that
you
are
under
affliction
said
the
consoler
offended
on
his
part
i
would
hear
no
national
the
afflicted
youth
apologised
in
his
turns
but
asserted
it
was
true
that
the
king
said
was
some
sort
of
noblewoman
and
that
he
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
the
match
and
had
run
about
like
an
old
gander
cackling
about
peggie
ever
since
he
had
seen
her
in
hose
and
doublet
and
no
wonder
added
poor
vin
with
a
deep
sigh
this
may
be
all
true
said
richie
though
it
sounds
strange
in
my
ears
but
man
you
should
not
speak
evil
of
dignities
not
the
king
jenkin

no
one
has
a
right
to
know
better
than
i
do
not
curse
the
foolish
old
man
said

have
them
carry
things

if
they
were
to
see
on
a
plain
field
thirty
thousand

at

did

that

said

into

looks
so
you
were

rowed
lord
glenvarloch
down

the
more
fool
i
that
did
not
souse
him
in

said
jenkin

i
was
the
lad
who
would
not
confess
one

and
what
i
was

she
must
be
an
piece
if
you
so
much
afraid
of
her

all

could
have
got
nothing
out

the
truth
came
out
some

way

i
ran
thinking
myself
one

in

death

me
out
of
my

but
are
ye
sure
ye
have
lost
her
said
richie
it
sounds
strange
in
my
ears
that
my
lord
glenvarloch
should
marry
the
daughter
of
a
dealer
though
there
are
uncouth
marriages
made
in
london
i
allow
why
i
tell
you
this
lord
was
no
sooner
clear
of
the

than
he
and
master
george
heriot
comes
to
make
proposals
for
her

for

hath

said

did
you
do

for
she
had
the
whole
out
ere
i
could
speak

her

fancy
she
took
silence
for
consent

thought
me

unutterably
to
have
one
thought
left

of
some
villainy
i
believe
that
horrid
murder
in
whitefriars
or
some
such
matter
but
i
might
have
heard
all
about
him
from
dame
suddlechop
for
she
spoke
of
my
meeting
him
at
enfield
chase
with
some
other
good
fellows
to
do
a
robbery
on
one
that
goes
northward
with
a
store
of
and
you
did
not
agree
to
this
fine
project
said
moniplies
i
cursed
her
for
a
hag
and
came
away
about
my
business
answered
jenkin
ay
and
what
said
she
to
that
man
that
would
startle
her
said
richie
not
a
whit
she
laughed
and
said
she
was
in
jest
answered
jenkin
but
i
know
the
jest
from
her
earnest
too
well
to
be
taken
in
that
way
but
she
knows
i
would
never
betray
her
betray
her
no
replied
richie
but
are
ye
in
any
shape
bound
to
this
birkie
peppercull
or
colepepper
or
whatever
they
call
him
that
ye
suld
let
him
do
a
robbery
on
the
honest
gentleman
that
is
travelling
to
the
north
and
may
be
a
kindly
scot
for
what
we
know
ay
going
home
with
a
load
of
english
money
said
jenkin
but
be
he
who
he
will
they
may
rob
the
whole
world
an
they
list
for
i
am
robbed
and
richie
filled
his
friend
cup
up
to
the
brim
and
insisted
that
he
should
drink
what
he
called
clean
caup
this
love
he
said
is
but
a
bairnly
matter
for
a
brisk
young
fellow
like
yourself
master
jenkin
and
if
ye
must
needs
have
a
whimsy
though
i
think
it
would
be
safer
to
venture
on
a
staid
womanly
body
why
here
be
as
bonny
lasses
in
london
as
this
you
need
not
sigh
sae
deeply
for
it
is
very
true
there
is
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
now
wherefore
should
you
who
are
as
brisk
and
trig
a
young
fellow
of
your
inches
as
the
sun
needs
to
shine
on
wherefore
need
you
sit
moping
this
way
and
not
try
some
bold
way
to
better
your
fortune
i
tell
you
master
moniplies
said
jenkin
i
am
as
poor
as
any
scot
among
you
i
have
broke
my
indenture
and
i
think
of
running
my
said
richie
but
that
maunna
be
man
i
ken
weel
by
sad
experience
that
poortith
takes
away
pith
and
the
man
sits
full
still
that
has
a
rent
in
his
breeks
footnote
this
elegant
speech
was
made
by
the
earl
of
douglas
called
tineman
after
being
wounded
and
made
prisoner
at
the
battle
of
shrewsbury
where
his
well
labouring
sword
had
three
times
slain
the
semblance
of
the
king
but
courage
man
you
have
served
me
heretofore
and
i
will
serve
you
now
if
you
will
but
bring
me
to
speech
of
this
same
captain
it
will
be
the
best
day
work
you
ever
i
guess
where
you
are
master
richard
you
would
save
your
long
purse
said
jenkin
i
can
not
see
how
that
should
advantage
me
but
i
reck
not
if
i
should
bear
a
hand
i
hate
that
braggart
that
cowardly
bully
if
you
can
get
me
mounted
i
care
not
if
i
show
you
where
the
dame
told
me
i
should
meet
him
but
you
must
stand
to
the
risk
for
though
he
is
a
coward
himself
i
know
he
will
have
more
than
one
stout
fellow
with
we
have
a
warrant
man
said
richie
and
the
hue
and
cry
to
we
will
have
no
such
thing
said
jenkin
if
i
am
to
go
with
you
i
am
not
the
lad
to
betray
any
one
to
the
harmanbeck
you
must
do
it
by
manhood
if
i
am
to
go
with
you
i
am
sworn
to
cutter
law
and
will
sell
no
man
aweel
said
richie
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
ye
must
think
that
i
was
born
and
bred
where
cracked
crowns
were
plentier
than
whole
ones
besides
i
have
two
noble
friends
here
master
lowestoffe
of
the
temple
and
his
cousin
master
ringwood
that
will
blithely
be
of
so
gallant
a
lowestoffe
and
ringwood
said
jenkin
they
are
both
brave
gallants
they
will
be
sure
company
know
you
where
they
are
to
be
found
ay
marry
do
i
replied
richie
they
are
fast
at
the
cards
and
dice
till
the
sma
hours
i
warrant
they
are
gentlemen
of
trust
and
honour
said
jenkin
and
if
they
advise
it
i
will
try
the
adventure
go
try
if
you
can
bring
them
hither
since
you
have
so
much
to
say
with
them
we
must
not
be
seen
abroad
i
know
not
how
it
is
master
moniplies
continued
he
as
his
countenance
brightened
up
and
while
in
his
turn
he
filled
the
cups
but
i
feel
my
heart
something
lighter
since
i
have
thought
of
this
thus
it
is
to
have
counsellors
master
jenkin
said
richie
and
truly
i
hope
to
hear
you
say
that
your
heart
is
as
light
as
a
lavrock
and
that
before
you
are
many
days
aulder
never
smile
and
shake
your
head
but
mind
what
i
tell
you
and
bide
here
in
the
meanwhile
till
i
go
to
seek
these
gallants
i
warrant
you
would
not
hold
them
back
from
such
a
ploy
as
i
shall
propose
to
chapter
xxxvi
the
thieves
have
bound
the
true
men
now
could
thou
and
i
rob
the
thieves
and
go
merrily
to
london
part
the
sun
was
high
upon
the
glades
of
enfield
chase
and
the
deer
with
which
it
then
abounded
were
seen
sporting
in
picturesque
groups
among
the
ancient
oaks
of
the
forest
when
a
cavalier
and
a
lady
on
foot
although
in
riding
apparel
sauntered
slowly
up
one
of
the
long
alleys
which
were
cut
through
the
park
for
the
convenience
of
the
hunters
their
only
attendant
was
a
page
who
riding
a
spanish
jennet
which
seemed
to
bear
a
heavy
followed
them
at
a
respectful
distance
the
female
attired
in
all
the
fantastic
finery
of
the
period
with
more
than
the
usual
quantity
of
bugles
flounces
and
trimmings
and
holding
her
fan
of
ostrich
feathers
in
one
hand
and
her
of
black
velvet
in
the
other
seemed
anxious
by
all
the
little
coquetry
practised
on
such
occasions
to
secure
the
notice
of
her
companion
who
sometimes
heard
her
prattle
without
seeming
to
attend
to
it
and
at
other
times
interrupted
his
train
of
graver
reflections
to
reply
to
her
nay
but
my
lord
my
lord
you
walk
so
fast
you
will
leave
me
behind
nay
i
will
have
hold
of
your
arm
but
how
to
manage
with
my
mask
and
my
fan
why
would
you
not
let
me
bring
my
to
follow
us
and
hold
my
things
but
see
i
will
put
my
fan
in
my
girdle
soh
and
now
that
i
have
a
hand
to
hold
you
with
you
shall
not
run
away
from
come
on
then
answered
the
gallant
and
let
us
walk
apace
since
you
would
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
with
your
gentlewoman
as
you
call
her
and
with
the
rest
of
the
you
may
perhaps
see
though
you
will
not
like
to
she
took
hold
of
his
arm
accordingly
but
as
he
continued
to
walk
at
the
same
pace
she
shortly
let
go
her
hold
exclaiming
that
he
had
hurt
her
hand
the
cavalier
stopped
and
looked
at
the
pretty
hand
and
arm
which
she
showed
him
with
exclamations
against
his
cruelty
i
dare
say
she
said
baring
her
wrist
and
a
part
of
her
arm
it
is
all
black
and
blue
to
the
very
i
dare
say
you
are
a
silly
little
fool
said
the
cavalier
carelessly
kissing
the
aggrieved
arm
it
is
only
a
pretty
incarnate
which
sets
off
the
blue
nay
my
lord
now
it
is
you
are
silly
answered
the
dame
but
i
am
glad
i
can
make
you
speak
and
laugh
on
any
terms
this
morning
i
am
sure
if
i
did
insist
on
following
you
into
the
forest
it
was
all
for
the
sake
of
diverting
you
i
am
better
company
than
your
page
i
and
now
tell
me
these
pretty
things
with
horns
be
they
not
deer
even
such
they
be
nelly
answered
her
neglectful
attendant
and
what
can
the
great
folk
do
with
so
many
of
them
forsooth
they
send
them
to
the
city
nell
where
wise
men
make
venison
pasties
of
their
flesh
and
wear
their
horns
for
trophies
answered
lord
dalgarno
whom
our
reader
has
already
recognised
nay
now
you
laugh
at
me
my
lord
answered
his
companion
but
i
know
all
about
venison
whatever
you
may
think
i
always
tasted
it
once
a
year
when
we
dined
with
deputy
she
continued
sadly
as
a
sense
of
her
degradation
stole
across
a
mind
bewildered
with
vanity
and
folly
though
he
would
not
speak
to
me
now
if
we
met
together
in
the
narrowest
lane
in
the
ward
i
warrant
he
would
not
said
lord
dalgarno
because
thou
nell
wouldst
dash
him
with
a
single
look
for
i
trust
thou
hast
more
spirit
than
to
throw
away
words
on
such
a
fellow
as
he
who
i
said
dame
nelly
nay
i
scorn
the
proud
princox
too
much
for
that
do
you
know
he
made
all
the
folk
in
the
ward
stand
cap
in
hand
to
him
my
poor
old
john
christie
and
all
here
her
recollection
began
to
overflow
at
her
eyes
a
plague
on
your
whimpering
said
dalgarno
somewhat
harshly
nay
never
look
pale
for
the
matter
nell
i
am
not
angry
with
you
you
simple
fool
but
what
would
you
have
me
think
when
you
are
eternally
looking
back
upon
your
dungeon
yonder
by
the
river
which
smelt
of
pitch
and
old
cheese
worse
than
a
welshman
does
of
onions
and
all
this
when
i
am
taking
you
down
to
a
castle
as
fine
as
is
in
fairy
land
shall
we
be
there
my
lord
said
nelly
drying
her
tears
nelly
no
nor
this
night
now
the
lord
be
with
us
and
keep
us
but
shall
we
not
go
by
sea
my
lord
i
thought
everybody
came
from
scotland
by
sea
i
am
sure
lord
glenvarloch
and
richie
moniplies
came
up
by
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
coming
up
and
going
down
nelly
answered
lord
dalgarno
and
so
there
is
for
certain
said
his
simple
companion
but
yet
i
think
i
heard
people
speaking
of
going
down
to
scotland
by
sea
as
well
as
coming
up
are
you
well
avised
of
the
way
do
you
think
it
possible
we
can
go
by
land
my
sweet
lord
it
is
but
trying
my
sweet
lady
said
lord
dalgarno
men
say
england
and
scotland
are
in
the
same
island
so
one
would
hope
there
may
be
some
road
betwixt
them
by
i
shall
never
be
able
to
ride
so
far
said
the
lady
we
will
have
your
saddle
stuffed
softer
said
the
lord
i
tell
you
that
you
shall
mew
your
city
slough
and
change
from
the
caterpillar
of
a
paltry
lane
into
the
butterfly
of
a
prince
garden
you
shall
have
as
many
tires
as
there
are
hours
in
the
day
as
many
handmaidens
as
there
are
days
in
the
week
as
many
menials
as
there
are
weeks
in
the
year
and
you
shall
ride
a
hunting
and
hawking
with
a
lord
instead
of
waiting
upon
an
old
who
could
do
nothing
but
hawk
and
ay
but
will
you
make
me
your
lady
said
dame
nelly
ay
surely
what
else
replied
the
lord
my
ay
but
i
mean
your
said
nelly
truly
nell
in
that
i
can
not
promise
to
oblige
you
a
continued
dalgarno
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
i
heard
from
suddlechop
whom
you
lodged
me
with
since
i
left
poor
old
john
christie
that
lord
glenvarloch
is
to
marry
david
ramsay
the
clockmaker
daughter
there
is
much
betwixt
the
cup
and
the
lip
nelly
i
wear
something
about
me
may
break
the
bans
of
that
hopeful
alliance
before
the
day
is
much
older
answered
lord
dalgarno
well
but
my
father
was
as
good
a
man
as
old
davy
ramsay
and
as
well
to
pass
in
the
world
my
lord
and
therefore
why
should
you
not
marry
me
you
have
done
me
harm
enough
i
trow
wherefore
should
you
not
do
me
this
justice
for
two
good
reasons
nelly
fate
put
a
husband
on
you
and
the
king
passed
a
wife
upon
me
answered
lord
dalgarno
ay
my
lord
said
nelly
but
they
remain
in
england
and
we
go
to
thy
argument
is
better
than
thou
art
aware
of
said
lord
dalgarno
i
have
heard
scottish
lawyers
say
the
matrimonial
tie
may
be
unclasped
in
our
happy
country
by
the
gentle
hand
of
the
ordinary
course
of
law
whereas
in
england
it
can
only
be
burst
by
an
act
of
parliament
well
nelly
we
will
look
into
that
matter
and
whether
we
get
married
again
or
no
we
will
at
least
do
our
best
to
get
shall
we
indeed
my
lord
and
then
i
will
think
less
about
john
christie
for
he
will
marry
again
i
warrant
you
for
he
is
well
to
pass
and
i
would
be
glad
to
think
he
had
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
as
i
used
to
do
poor
loving
old
man
he
was
a
kind
man
though
he
was
a
score
of
years
older
than
i
and
i
hope
and
pray
he
will
never
let
a
young
lord
cross
his
honest
threshold
again
here
the
dame
was
once
more
much
inclined
to
give
way
to
a
passion
of
tears
but
lord
dalgarno
conjured
down
the
emotion
by
saying
with
some
asperity
i
am
weary
of
these
april
passions
my
pretty
mistress
and
i
think
you
will
do
well
to
preserve
your
tears
for
some
more
pressing
occasion
who
knows
what
turn
of
fortune
may
in
a
few
minutes
call
for
more
of
them
than
you
can
render
goodness
my
lord
what
mean
you
by
such
expressions
john
christie
the
kind
heart
used
to
keep
no
secrets
from
me
and
i
hope
your
lordship
will
not
hide
your
counsel
from
me
sit
down
beside
me
on
this
bank
said
the
nobleman
i
am
bound
to
remain
here
for
a
short
space
and
if
you
can
be
but
silent
i
should
like
to
spend
a
part
of
it
in
considering
how
far
i
can
on
the
present
occasion
follow
the
respectable
example
which
you
recommend
to
the
place
at
which
he
stopped
was
at
that
time
little
more
than
a
mound
partly
surrounded
by
a
ditch
from
which
it
derived
the
name
of
camlet
moat
a
few
hewn
stones
there
were
which
had
escaped
the
fate
of
many
others
that
had
been
used
in
building
different
lodges
in
the
forest
for
the
royal
keepers
these
vestiges
just
sufficient
to
show
that
herein
former
times
the
hand
of
man
had
been
marked
the
ruins
of
the
abode
of
a
once
illustrious
but
family
the
mandevilles
earls
of
essex
to
whom
enfield
chase
and
the
extensive
domains
adjacent
had
belonged
in
elder
days
a
wild
woodland
prospect
led
the
eye
at
various
points
through
broad
and
seemingly
interminable
alleys
which
meeting
at
this
point
as
at
a
common
centre
diverged
from
each
other
as
they
receded
and
had
therefore
been
selected
by
lord
dalgarno
as
the
rendezvous
for
the
combat
which
through
the
medium
of
richie
moniplies
he
had
offered
to
his
injured
friend
lord
glenvarloch
he
will
surely
come
he
said
to
himself
cowardice
was
not
wont
to
be
his
fault
at
least
he
was
bold
enough
in
the
perhaps
yonder
churl
may
not
have
carried
my
message
but
no
he
is
a
sturdy
knave
one
of
those
would
prize
their
master
honour
above
their
look
to
the
palfrey
lutin
and
see
thou
let
him
not
loose
and
cast
thy
falcon
glance
down
every
avenue
to
mark
if
any
one
buckingham
has
undergone
my
challenge
but
the
proud
minion
pleads
the
king
paltry
commands
for
refusing
to
answer
me
if
i
can
baffle
this
glenvarloch
or
slay
him
if
i
can
spoil
him
of
his
honour
or
his
life
i
shall
go
down
to
scotland
with
credit
sufficient
to
gild
over
past
mischances
i
know
my
dear
countrymen
they
never
quarrel
with
any
one
who
brings
them
home
either
gold
or
martial
glory
much
more
if
he
has
both
gold
and
as
he
thus
reflected
and
called
to
mind
the
disgrace
which
he
had
suffered
as
well
as
the
causes
he
imagined
for
hating
lord
glenvarloch
his
countenance
altered
under
the
influence
of
his
contending
emotions
to
the
terror
of
nelly
who
sitting
unnoticed
at
his
feet
and
looking
anxiously
in
his
face
beheld
the
cheek
kindle
the
mouth
become
compressed
the
eye
dilated
and
the
whole
countenance
express
the
desperate
and
deadly
resolution
of
one
who
awaits
an
instant
and
decisive
encounter
with
a
mortal
enemy
the
loneliness
of
the
place
the
scenery
so
different
from
that
to
which
alone
she
had
been
accustomed
the
dark
and
sombre
air
which
crept
so
suddenly
over
the
countenance
of
her
seducer
his
command
imposing
silence
upon
her
and
the
apparent
strangeness
of
his
conduct
in
idling
away
so
much
time
without
any
obvious
cause
when
a
journey
of
such
length
lay
before
them
brought
strange
thoughts
into
her
weak
brain
she
had
read
of
women
seduced
from
their
matrimonial
duties
by
sorcerers
allied
to
the
hellish
powers
nay
by
the
father
of
evil
himself
who
after
conveying
his
victim
into
some
desert
remote
from
human
kind
exchanged
the
pleasing
shape
in
which
he
gained
her
affections
for
all
his
natural
horrors
she
chased
this
wild
idea
away
as
it
crowded
itself
upon
her
weak
and
bewildered
imagination
yet
she
might
have
lived
to
see
it
realised
allegorically
if
not
literally
but
for
the
accident
which
presently
followed
the
page
whose
eyes
were
remarkably
acute
at
length
called
out
to
his
master
pointing
with
his
finger
at
the
same
time
down
one
of
the
alleys
that
horsemen
were
advancing
in
that
direction
lord
dalgarno
started
up
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
gazed
eagerly
down
the
alley
when
at
the
same
instant
he
received
a
shot
which
grazing
his
hand
passed
right
through
his
brain
and
laid
him
a
lifeless
corpse
at
the
feet
or
rather
across
the
lap
of
the
unfortunate
victim
of
his
profligacy
the
countenance
whose
varied
expression
she
had
been
watching
for
the
last
five
minutes
was
convulsed
for
an
instant
and
then
stiffened
into
rigidity
for
ever
three
ruffians
rushed
from
the
brake
from
which
the
shot
had
been
fired
ere
the
smoke
was
dispersed
one
with
many
imprecations
seized
on
the
page
another
on
the
female
upon
whose
cries
he
strove
by
the
most
violent
threats
to
impose
silence
whilst
the
third
began
to
undo
the
burden
from
the
horse
but
an
instant
rescue
prevented
their
availing
themselves
of
the
advantage
they
had
obtained
it
may
easily
be
supposed
that
richie
moniplies
having
secured
the
assistance
of
the
two
templars
ready
enough
to
join
in
any
thing
which
promised
a
fray
with
jin
vin
to
act
as
their
guide
had
set
off
gallantly
mounted
and
well
armed
under
the
belief
that
they
would
reach
camlet
moat
before
the
robbers
and
apprehend
them
in
the
fact
they
had
not
calculated
that
according
to
the
custom
of
robbers
in
other
countries
but
contrary
to
that
of
the
english
highwayman
of
those
days
they
meant
to
ensure
robbery
by
previous
murder
an
accident
also
happened
to
delay
them
a
little
while
on
the
road
in
riding
through
one
of
the
glades
of
the
forest
they
found
a
man
dismounted
and
sitting
under
a
tree
groaning
with
such
bitterness
of
spirit
that
lowestoffe
could
not
forbear
asking
if
he
was
hurt
in
answer
he
said
he
was
an
unhappy
man
in
pursuit
of
his
wife
who
had
been
carried
off
by
a
villain
and
as
he
raised
his
countenance
the
eyes
of
richie
to
his
great
astonishment
encountered
the
visage
of
john
christie
for
the
almighty
sake
help
me
master
moniplies
he
said
i
have
learned
my
wife
is
but
a
short
mile
before
with
that
black
villain
lord
have
him
forward
by
all
means
said
lowestoffe
a
second
orpheus
seeking
his
eurydice
have
him
forward
we
will
save
lord
purse
and
ease
him
of
his
mistress
have
him
with
us
were
it
but
for
the
variety
of
the
adventure
i
owe
his
lordship
a
grudge
for
rooking
me
we
have
ten
minutes
but
it
is
dangerous
to
calculate
closely
in
matters
of
life
and
death
in
all
probability
the
minute
or
two
which
was
lost
in
mounting
john
christie
behind
one
of
their
party
might
have
saved
lord
dalgarno
from
his
fate
thus
his
criminal
amour
became
the
indirect
cause
of
his
losing
his
life
and
thus
our
pleasant
vices
are
made
the
whips
to
scourge
the
riders
arrived
on
the
field
at
full
gallop
the
moment
after
the
shot
was
fired
and
richie
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
attaching
himself
to
colepepper
who
was
bustling
to
untie
the
portmanteau
from
the
saddle
pushed
against
him
with
such
violence
as
to
overthrow
him
his
own
horse
at
the
same
time
stumbling
and
dismounting
his
rider
who
was
none
of
the
first
equestrians
the
undaunted
richie
immediately
arose
however
and
grappled
with
the
ruffian
with
such
that
though
a
strong
fellow
and
though
a
coward
now
rendered
desperate
moniplies
got
him
under
wrenched
a
long
knife
from
his
hand
dealt
him
a
desperate
stab
with
his
own
weapon
and
leaped
on
his
feet
and
as
the
wounded
man
struggled
to
follow
his
example
he
struck
him
upon
the
head
with
the
of
a
musketoon
which
last
blow
proved
fatal
bravo
richie
cried
lowestoffe
who
had
himself
engaged
at
with
one
of
the
ruffians
and
soon
put
him
to
flight
bravo
why
man
there
lies
sin
struck
down
like
an
ox
and
iniquity
throat
cut
like
a
i
know
not
why
you
should
upbraid
me
with
my
upbringing
master
lowestoffe
answered
richie
with
great
composure
but
i
can
tell
you
the
shambles
is
not
a
bad
place
for
training
one
to
this
the
other
templar
now
shouted
loudly
to
them
if
ye
be
men
come
hither
here
lies
lord
dalgarno
murdered
lowestoffe
and
richie
ran
to
the
spot
and
the
page
took
the
opportunity
finding
himself
now
neglected
on
all
hands
to
ride
off
in
a
different
direction
and
neither
he
nor
the
considerable
sum
with
which
his
horse
was
burdened
were
ever
heard
of
from
that
moment
the
third
ruffian
had
not
waited
the
attack
of
the
templar
and
jin
vin
the
latter
of
whom
had
put
down
old
christie
from
behind
him
that
he
might
ride
the
lighter
and
the
whole
five
now
stood
gazing
with
horror
on
the
bloody
corpse
of
the
young
nobleman
and
the
wild
sorrow
of
the
female
who
tore
her
hair
and
shrieked
in
the
most
disconsolate
manner
until
her
agony
was
at
once
checked
or
rather
received
a
new
direction
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
of
her
husband
who
fixing
on
her
a
cold
and
severe
look
said
in
a
tone
suited
to
his
manner
ay
woman
thou
takest
on
sadly
for
the
loss
of
thy
then
looking
on
the
bloody
corpse
of
him
from
whom
he
had
received
so
deep
an
injury
he
repeated
the
solemn
words
of
scripture
is
mine
saith
the
lord
and
i
will
repay
it
i
whom
thou
hast
injured
will
be
first
to
render
thee
the
decent
offices
due
to
the
so
saying
he
covered
the
dead
body
with
his
cloak
and
then
looking
on
it
for
a
moment
seemed
to
reflect
on
what
he
had
next
to
perform
as
the
eye
of
the
injured
man
slowly
passed
from
the
body
of
the
seducer
to
the
partner
and
victim
of
his
crime
who
had
sunk
down
to
his
feet
which
she
clasped
without
venturing
to
look
up
his
features
naturally
coarse
and
saturnine
assumed
a
dignity
of
expression
which
overawed
the
young
templars
and
repulsed
the
officious
forwardness
of
richie
moniplies
who
was
at
first
eager
to
have
thrust
in
his
advice
and
opinion
kneel
not
to
me
woman
he
said
but
kneel
to
the
god
thou
hast
offended
more
than
thou
couldst
offend
such
another
worm
as
thyself
how
often
have
i
told
thee
when
thou
wert
at
the
gayest
and
the
lightest
that
pride
goeth
before
destruction
and
a
haughty
spirit
before
a
fall
vanity
brought
folly
and
folly
brought
sin
and
sin
hath
brought
death
his
original
companion
thou
must
needs
leave
duty
and
decency
and
domestic
love
to
revel
it
gaily
with
the
wild
and
with
the
wicked
and
there
thou
liest
like
a
crushed
worm
writhing
beside
the
lifeless
body
of
thy
paramour
thou
hast
done
me
much
wrong
dishonoured
me
among
friends
driven
credit
from
my
house
and
peace
from
my
fireside
but
thou
wert
my
first
and
only
love
and
i
will
not
see
thee
an
utter
castaway
if
it
lies
with
me
to
prevent
gentlemen
i
render
ye
such
thanks
as
a
man
can
richard
commend
me
to
your
honourable
master
i
added
gall
to
the
bitterness
of
his
affliction
but
i
was
rise
up
woman
and
follow
he
raised
her
up
by
the
arm
while
with
streaming
eyes
and
bitter
sobs
she
endeavoured
to
express
her
penitence
she
kept
her
hands
spread
over
her
face
yet
suffered
him
to
lead
her
away
and
it
was
only
as
they
turned
around
a
brake
which
concealed
the
scene
they
had
left
that
she
turned
back
and
casting
one
wild
and
hurried
glance
towards
the
corpse
of
dalgarno
uttered
a
shriek
and
clinging
to
her
arm
exclaimed
wildly
save
me
save
me
they
have
murdered
him
lowestoffe
was
much
moved
by
what
he
had
witnessed
but
he
was
ashamed
as
a
of
his
own
unfashionable
emotion
and
did
a
force
to
his
feelings
when
he
exclaimed
ay
let
them
go
the
believing
forgiving
husband
the
liberal
accommodating
spouse
o
what
a
generous
creature
is
your
true
london
husband
horns
hath
he
but
tame
as
a
fatted
ox
he
goreth
not
i
should
like
to
see
her
when
she
hath
exchanged
her
mask
and
for
her
peaked
hat
and
muffler
we
will
visit
them
at
paul
wharf
coz
it
will
be
a
convenient
you
had
better
think
of
catching
the
gipsy
thief
lutin
said
richie
moniplies
for
by
my
faith
he
is
off
with
his
master
baggage
and
the
a
keeper
with
his
assistants
and
several
other
persons
had
now
come
to
the
spot
and
made
hue
and
cry
after
lutin
but
in
vain
to
their
custody
the
templars
surrendered
the
dead
bodies
and
after
going
through
some
formal
investigation
they
returned
with
richard
and
vincent
to
london
where
they
received
great
applause
for
their
vincent
errors
were
easily
expiated
in
consideration
of
his
having
been
the
means
of
breaking
up
this
band
of
villains
and
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
what
would
have
diminished
the
credit
of
the
action
in
other
instances
rather
added
to
it
in
the
actual
circumstances
namely
that
they
came
too
late
to
save
lord
dalgarno
george
heriot
who
suspected
how
matters
stood
with
vincent
requested
and
obtained
permission
from
his
master
to
send
the
poor
young
fellow
on
an
important
piece
of
business
to
paris
we
are
unable
to
trace
his
fate
farther
but
believe
it
was
prosperous
and
that
he
entered
into
an
advantageous
partnership
with
his
upon
old
davy
ramsay
retiring
from
business
in
consequence
of
his
marriage
that
eminent
antiquary

possessed
of
an
antique
watch
with

being
a
piece
of
catgut
instead
of
a

which
bears
the
names
of

and
tunstall
master
lowestoffe
failed
not
to
vindicate
his
character
as
a
man
of
gaiety
by
inquiring
after
john
christie
and
dame
nelly
but
greatly
to
his
surprise
indeed
to
his
loss
for
he
had
wagered
ten
pieces
that
he
would
domesticate
himself
in
the
family
he
found
the
as
it
was
called
of
the
shop
was
sold
the
stock
auctioned
and
the
late
proprietor
and
his
wife
gone
no
one
knew
whither
the
prevailing
belief
was
that
they
had
emigrated
to
one
of
the
new
settlements
in
america
lady
dalgarno
received
the
news
of
her
unworthy
husband
death
with
a
variety
of
emotions
among
which
horror
that
he
should
have
been
cut
off
in
the
middle
career
of
his
profligacy
was
the
most
prominent
the
incident
greatly
deepened
her
melancholy
and
injured
her
health
already
shaken
by
previous
circumstances
repossessed
of
her
own
fortune
by
her
husband
death
she
was
anxious
to
do
justice
to
lord
glenvarloch
by
treating
for
the
recovery
of
the
mortgage
but
the
scrivener
having
taken
fright
at
the
late
events
had
left
the
city
and
absconded
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
discover
into
whose
hands
the
papers
had
now
passed
richard
moniplies
was
silent
for
his
own
reasons
the
templars
who
had
witnessed
the
transaction
kept
the
secret
at
his
request
and
it
was
universally
believed
that
the
scrivener
had
carried
off
the
writings
along
with
him
we
may
here
observe
that
fears
similar
to
those
of
skurliewhitter
freed
london
for
ever
from
the
presence
of
dame
suddlechop
who
ended
her
career
in
the
viz
bridewell
of
amsterdam
the
stout
old
lord
huntinglen
with
a
haughty
carriage
and
unmoistened
eye
accompanied
the
funeral
procession
of
his
only
son
to
its
last
abode
and
perhaps
the
single
tear
which
fell
at
length
upon
the
coffin
was
given
less
to
the
fate
of
the
individual
than
to
the
extinction
of
the
last
male
of
his
ancient
race
chapter
xxxvii
there
is
suie
another
flood
toward
and
these
couples
are
coming
to
the
ark
here
comes
a
pair
of
very
strange
you
like
the
fashion
of
such
narratives
as
the
present
changes
like
other
earthly
things
time
was
that
the
was
obliged
to
wind
up
his
story
by
a
circumstantial
description
of
the
wedding
bedding
and
throwing
the
stocking
as
the
grand
catastrophe
to
which
through
so
many
circumstances
of
doubt
and
difficulty
he
had
at
length
happily
conducted
his
hero
and
heroine
not
a
circumstance
was
then
omitted
from
the
manly
ardour
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
modest
blushes
of
the
bride
to
the
parson
new
surplice
and
the
silk
tabinet
mantua
of
the
bridesmaid
but
such
descriptions
are
now
discarded
for
the
same
reason
i
suppose
that
public
marriages
are
no
longer
fashionable
and
that
instead
of
calling
together
their
friends
to
a
feast
and
a
dance
the
happy
couple
elope
in
a
solitary
as
secretly
as
if
they
meant
to
go
to
or
to
do
worse
i
am
not
ungrateful
for
a
change
which
saves
an
author
the
trouble
of
attempting
in
vain
to
give
a
new
colour
to
the
commonplace
description
of
such
matters
but
notwithstanding
i
find
myself
forced
upon
it
in
the
present
instance
as
circumstances
sometimes
compel
a
stranger
to
make
use
of
an
old
road
which
has
been
for
some
time
shut
up
the
experienced
reader
may
have
already
remarked
that
the
last
chapter
was
employed
in
sweeping
out
of
the
way
all
the
unnecessary
and
less
interesting
characters
that
i
might
clear
the
floor
for
a
blithe
bridal
in
truth
it
would
be
unpardonable
to
pass
over
slightly
what
so
deeply
interested
our
principal
personage
king
james
that
learned
and
monarch
made
no
great
figure
in
the
politics
of
europe
but
then
to
make
amends
he
was
prodigiously
busy
when
he
could
find
a
fair
opportunity
of
intermeddling
with
the
private
affairs
of
his
loving
subjects
and
the
approaching
marriage
of
lord
glenvarloch
was
matter
of
great
interest
to
him
he
had
been
much
struck
that
is
for
him
who
was
not
very
accessible
to
such
emotions
with
the
beauty
and
embarrassment
of
the
pretty
as
he
called
her
when
he
first
saw
her
and
he
glorified
himself
greatly
on
the
acuteness
which
he
had
displayed
in
detecting
her
disguise
and
in
carrying
through
the
whole
inquiry
which
took
place
in
consequence
of
it
he
laboured
for
several
weeks
while
the
courtship
was
in
progress
with
his
own
royal
eyes
so
as
wellnigh
to
wear
out
he
declared
a
pair
of
her
father
best
barnacles
in
searching
through
old
books
and
documents
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
bride
pretensions
to
a
noble
though
remote
descent
and
thereby
remove
the
only
objection
which
envy
might
conceive
against
the
match
in
his
own
opinion
at
least
he
was
eminently
successful
for
when
sir
mungo
malagrowther
one
day
in
the
took
upon
him
to
grieve
bitterly
for
the
bride
lack
of
pedigree
the
monarch
cut
him
short
with
ye
may
save
your
grief
for
your
ain
next
occasions
sir
mungo
for
by
our
royal
saul
we
will
uphauld
her
father
davy
ramsay
to
be
a
gentleman
of
nine
descents
whase
great
gudesire
came
of
the
auld
martial
stock
of
the
house
of
dalwolsey
than
whom
better
men
never
did
and
better
never
will
draw
sword
for
king
and
country
heard
ye
never
of
sir
william
ramsay
of
dalwolsey
man
of
whom
john
fordoun
saith
was
nobilissimus
his
castle
stands
to
witness
for
itsell
not
three
miles
from
dalkeith
man
and
within
a
mile
of
bannockrig
davy
ramsay
came
of
that
auld
and
honoured
stock
and
i
trust
he
hath
not
derogated
from
his
ancestors
by
his
present
craft
they
all
wrought
wi
steel
man
only
the
auld
knights
drilled
holes
their
swords
in
their
enemies
corslets
and
he
saws
nicks
in
his
brass
wheels
and
i
hope
it
is
as
honourable
to
give
eyes
to
the
blind
as
to
slash
them
out
of
the
head
of
those
that
see
and
to
show
us
how
to
value
our
time
as
it
passes
as
to
fling
it
away
in
drinking
brawling
and
unchristian
doings
and
you
maun
understand
that
davy
ramsay
is
no
mechanic
but
follows
a
liberal
art
which
approacheth
almost
to
the
act
of
creating
a
living
being
seeing
it
may
be
said
of
a
watch
as
claudius
saith
of
the

give

a
as
well
as
a
pedigree

sir
mungo
it
done
or
ye
bade

mungo
said
the
king
and
i
trust
we
who
are
the
fountain
of
all
earthly
honour
are
free
to
spirit
a
few
drops
of
it
on
one
so
near
our
person
without
offence
to
the
knight
of
castle
girnigo
we
have
already
spoken
with
the
learned
men
of
the
college
and
we
propose
to
grant
him
an
augmented
being
his
paternal
coat
charged
with
the
of
a
watch
in
chief
for
a
difference
and
we
purpose
to
add
time
and
eternity
for
supporters
as
soon
as
the

shall
be
able
to
devise
how
eternity
is
to

chaucer
says
there
is
nothing
new
but
what
it
has
been
old
the
reader
has
here
the
original
of
an
anecdote
which
has
since
been
fathered
on
a
scottish
chief
of
our
own
time
said
archie
armstrong
the
court
fool
who
chanced
to
be
present
when
the
king
stated
this
dilemma
peace
man
ye
shall
be
whippet
said
the
king
in
return
for
this
hint
and
you
my
liege
subjects
of
england
may
weel
take
a
hint
from
what
we
have
said
and
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
laugh
at
our
scottish
pedigrees
though
they
be
somewhat
long
derived
and
difficult
to
be
deduced
ye
see
that
a
man
of
right
gentle
blood
may
for
a
season
lay
by
his
gentry
and
yet
ken
whare
to
find
it
when
he
has
occasion
for
it
it
would
be
as
unseemly
for
a
packman
or
pedlar
as
ye
call
a
travelling
merchant
whilk
is
a
trade
to
which
our
native
subjects
of
scotland
are
specially
addicted
to
be
blazing
his
genealogy
in
the
faces
of
those
to
whom
he
sells
a
bawbee
worth
of
ribbon
as
it
would
be
to
him
to
have
a
beaver
on
his
head
and
a
rapier
by
his
side
when
the
pack
was
on
his
shoulders
na
na
he
hings
his
sword
on
the
cleek
lays
his
beaver
on
the
shelf
puts
his
pedigree
into
his
pocket
and
gangs
as
doucely
and
cannily
about
his
peddling
craft
as
if
his
blood
was
nae
better
than
but
let
our
pedlar
be
transformed
as
i
have
kend
it
happen
mair
than
ance
into
a
bein
thriving
merchant
then
ye
shall
have
a
transformation

his

on
he
buckles
his

gives
his

and
cocks
it
in
the
face
of
all
creation
we
mention
these
things
at
the
mair
length
because
we
would
have
you
all
to
know
that
it
is
not
without
due
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
all
parties
that
we
design
in
a
small
and
private
way
to
honour
with
our
own
royal
presence
the
marriage
of
lord
glenvarloch

heiress
of
david
ramsay
our
horologer

a
cadet
only
thrice
removed
from

ancient

we
are
grieved
we
can
not
have
the
presence
of
the
noble
chief
of
that
house
at
the
ceremony
but
where
there
is
honour
to

good
heriot
bowed
as
in
duty
bound
in
fact
the
king
who
was
a
great
politician
about
trifles
had
manoeuvred
greatly
on
this
occasion
and
had
contrived
to
get
the
prince
and
buckingham
dispatched
on
an
expedition
to
newmarket
in
order
that
he
might
find
an
opportunity
in
their
absence
of
indulging
himself
in
his
own
gossiping
habits
which
were
distasteful
to
charles
whose
temper
inclined
to
formality
and
with
which
even
the
favourite
of
late
had
not
thought
it
worth
while
to
seem
to
sympathise
when
the
levee
was
dismissed
sir
mungo
malagrowther
seized
upon
the
worthy
citizen
in
the
of
the
palace
and
detained
him
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
for
the
purpose
of
subjecting
him
to
the
following
scrutiny
this
is
a
sair
job
on
you
master
george
the

must
have
had
little

this
will
cost
you
a
bonny
penny
this

dinner
it
will
not

sir

answered
heriot
the

that
they
may

what

we

with
the

the
of
the
scots
now
disused
even
among
the
lowest
ranks
was
a
peculiar
species
of
at
which
if
the
wedded
pair
were
popular
the
guests
who
convened
contributed
considerable
sums
under
pretence
of
paying
for
the
bridal
festivity
but
in
reality
to
set
the
married
folk
afloat
in
the
world
only
a
trifle
sir
mungo
i
give
my
the
marriage
ring
it
is
a
curious
jewel
i
bought
it
in
italy
it
belonged
to
cosmo
de

the
bride
will
not
need
my
help
she
has
an
estate
which
belonged
to
her
maternal
the
auld
said
sir
mungo
it
will
need
some
of
his
suds
to
scour
the
blot
out
of
the
glenvarloch
shield
i
have
heard
that
estate
was
no
great
it
is
as
good
as
some
posts
at
court
sir
mungo
which
are
coveted
by
persons
of
high
quality
replied
george
heriot
court

said
ye
court
favour
master
heriot
replied
sir
mungo
choosing
then
to
use
his
malady
of
misapprehension
moonshine
in
water
poor
thing
if
that
is
all
she
is
to
be
tochered
with
i
am
truly
solicitous
about
i
will
let
you
into
a
secret
said
the
citizen
which
will
relieve
your
tender
anxiety
the
dowager
lady
dalgarno
gives
a
competent
fortune
to
the
bride
and
settles
the
rest
of
her
estate
upon
her
nephew
the
ay
say
ye
sae
said
sir
mungo
just
to
show
her
regard
to
her
husband
that
is
in
the
tomb
lucky
that
her
nephew
did
not
send
him
there
it
was
a
strange
story
that
death
of
poor
lord
dalgarno
some
folk
think
the
poor
gentleman
had
much
wrong
little
good
comes
of
marrying
the
daughter
of
the
house
you
are
at
feud
with
indeed
it
was
less
poor
dalgarno
fault
than
theirs
that
forced
the
match
on
him
but
i
am
glad
the
young
folk
are
to
have
something
to
live
on
come
how
it
like
whether
by
charity
or
inheritance
but
if
the
lady
dalgarno
were
to
sell
all
she
has
even
to
her
very
she
canna
gie
them
back
the
fair
castle
of
glenvarloch
that
is
lost
and
gane
lost
and
it
is
but
too
true
said
george
heriot
we
can
not
discover
what
has
become
of
the
villain
andrew
skurliewhitter
or
what
lord
dalgarno
has
done
with
the
assigned
it
away
to
some
one
that
his
wife
might
not
get
it
after
he
was
gane
it
would
have
disturbed
him
in
his
grave
to
think
glenvarloch
should
get
that
land
back
again
said
sir
mungo
depend
on
it
he
will
have
sure
measures
to
keep
that
noble
lordship
out
of
her
grips
or
her
nevoy
indeed
it
is
but
too
probable
sir
mungo
said
master
heriot
but
as
i
am
obliged
to
go
and
look
after
many
things
in
consequence
of
this
ceremony
i
must
leave
you
to
comfort
yourself
with
the
the
you
say
is
to
be
on
the
thirtieth
of
the
instant
month
said
sir
mungo
holloing
after
the
citizen
i
will
be
with
you
in
the
hour
of
the
king
invites
the
guests
said
george
heriot
without
turning
back
the
mechanic
soliloquised
sir
mungo
if
it
were
not
the
odd
score
of
pounds
he
lent
me
last
week
i
would
teach
him
how
to
bear
himself
to
a
man
of
quality
but
i
will
be
at
the
bridal
banquet
in
spite
of
sir
mungo
contrived
to
get
invited
or
commanded
to
attend
on
the
bridal
accordingly
at
which
there
were
but
few
persons
present
for
james
on
such
occasions
preferred
a
snug
privacy
which
gave
him
liberty
to
lay
aside
the
encumbrance
as
he
felt
it
to
be
of
his
regal
dignity
the
company
was
very
small
and
indeed
there
were
at
least
two
persons
absent
whose
presence
might
have
been
expected
the
first
of
these
was
the
lady
dalgarno
the
state
of
whose
health
as
well
as
the
recent
death
of
her
husband
precluded
her
attendance
on
the
ceremony
the
other
absentee
was
richie
moniplies
whose
conduct
for
some
time
past
had
been
extremely
mysterious
regulating
his
attendance
on
lord
glenvarloch
entirely
according
to
his
own
will
and
pleasure
he
had
ever
since
the
rencounter
in
enfield
chase
appeared
regularly
at
his
bedside
in
the
morning
to
assist
him
to
dress
and
at
his
wardrobe
in
the
evening
the
rest
of
the
day
he
disposed
of
at
his
own
pleasure
without
control
from
his
lord
who
had
now
a
complete
establishment
of
attendants
yet
he
was
somewhat
curious
to
know
how
the
fellow
disposed
of
so
much
of
his
time
but
on
this
subject
richie
showed
no
desire
to
be
communicative
on
the
morning
of
the
richie
was
particularly
attentive
in
doing
all
a
could
so
as
to
set
off
to
advantage
the
very
handsome
figure
of
his
master
and
when
he
had
arranged
his
dress
to
the
utmost
exactness
and
put
to
his
long
curled
locks
what
he
called
the
finishing
touch
of
the
he
gravely
kneeled
down
kissed
his
hand
and
bade
him
farewell
saying
that
he
humbly
craved
leave
to
discharge
himself
of
his
lordship
service
why
what
humour
is
this
said
lord
glenvarloch
if
you
mean
to
discharge
yourself
of
my
service
richie
i
suppose
you
intend
to
enter
my
wife
i
wish
her
good
ladyship
that
shall
soon
be
and
your
good
lordship
the
blessings
of
as
good
a
servant
as
myself
in
heaven
good
time
said
richie
but
fate
hath
so
ordained
it
that
i
can
henceforth
only
be
your
servant
in
the
way
of
friendly
well
richie
said
the
young
lord
if
you
are
tired
of
service
we
will
seek
some
better
provision
for
you
but
you
will
wait
on
me
to
the
church
and
partake
of
the
bridal
dinner
under
favour
my
lord
answered
richie
i
must
remind
you
of
our
covenant
having
presently
some
pressing
business
of
mine
own
whilk
will
detain
me
during
the
ceremony
but
i
will
not
fail
to
prie
master
george
good
cheer
in
respect
he
has
made
very
costly
fare
whilk
it
would
be
unthankful
not
to
partake
do
as
you
list
answered
lord
glenvarloch
and
having
bestowed
a
passing
thought
on
the
whimsical
and
pragmatical
disposition
of
his
follower
he
dismissed
the
subject
for
others
better
suited
to
the
day
the
reader
must
fancy
the
scattered
flowers
which
strewed
the
path
of
the
happy
couple
to
church
the
loud
music
which
accompanied
the
procession
the
marriage
service
performed
by
a
bishop
the
king
who
met
them
at
saint
paul
giving
away
the
bride
to
the
great
relief
of
her
father
who
had
thus
time
during
the
ceremony
to
calculate
the
just
quotient
to
be
laid
on
the
pinion
of
report
in
a
timepiece
which
he
was
then
putting
together
when
the
ceremony
was
finished
the
company
were
transported
in
the
royal
carriages
to
george
heriot
where
a
splendid
collation
was
provided
for
the
in
the
foljambe
apartments
the
king
no
sooner
found
himself
in
this
snug
retreat
than
casting
from
him
his
sword
and
belt
with
such
haste
as
if
they
burnt
his
fingers
and
flinging
his
plumed
hat
on
the
table
as
who
should
say
lie
there
authority
he
swallowed
a
hearty
cup
of
wine
to
the
happiness
of
the
married
couple
and
began
to
amble
about
the
room
mumping
laughing
and
cracking
jests
neither
the
wittiest
nor
the
most
delicate
but
accompanied
and
applauded
by
shouts
of
his
own
mirth
in
order
to
encourage
that
of
the
company
whilst
his
majesty
was
in
the
midst
of
this
gay
humour
and
a
call
to
the
banquet
was
anxiously
expected
a
servant
whispered
master
heriot
forth
of
the
apartment
when
he
he
walked
up
to
the
king
and
in
his
turn
whispered
something
at
which
james
started
he
is
not
wanting
his
siller
said
the
king
shortly
and
sharply
by
no
means
my
liege
answered
heriot
it
is
a
subject
he
states
himself
as
quite
indifferent
about
so
long
as
it
can
pleasure
your
body
of
us
man
said
the
king
it
is
the
speech
of
a
true
man
and
a
loving
subject
and
we
will
grace
him
accordingly
what
though
he
be
but
a
carle
a
twopenny
cat
may
look
at
a
king
swith
man
have
him
moniplies
they
should
have
called
the
chield
monypennies
though
i
sall
warrant
you
english
think
we
have
not
such
a
name
in
it
is
an
ancient
and
honourable
stock
the
monypennies
said
sir
mungo
malagrowther
the
only
loss
is
there
are
sae
few
of
the
the
family
seems
to
increase
among
your
countrymen
sir
mungo
said
master
lowestoffe
whom
lord
glenvarloch
had
invited
to
be
present
since
his
majesty
happy
accession
brought
so
many
of

and
looking

some
of
ourselves
been
the
better
of
that
great
blessing
to
the
english
as
he
spoke
the
door
flew
open
and
in
entered
to
the
astonishment
of
lord
glenvarloch
his
late
richie
moniplies
now
sumptuously
nay
gorgeously
attired
in
a
superb
brocaded
suit
and
leading
in
his
hand
the
tall
thin
withered
somewhat
distorted
form
of
martha
trapbois
arrayed
in
a
complete
dress
of
black
velvet
which
suited
so
strangely
with
the
pallid
and
severe
melancholy
of
her
countenance
that
the
king
himself
exclaimed
in
some
perturbation
what
the
deil
has
the
fallow
brought
us
here
body
of
our
regal
selves
it
is
a
corpse
that

saul
of
our
body

but
she
looks
wondrous
grim
answered
king
james
art
thou
sure
she
has
not
been
in
her
time
maid
of
honour
to
queen
mary
our
kinswoman
of
redhot
memory
i
am
sure
an
it
like
your
majesty
that
she
has
brought
me
fifty
thousand
pounds
of
good
siller
and
better
and
that
has
enabled
me
to
pleasure
your
majesty
and
other
ye
need
have
said
naething
about
that
man
said
the
king
we
ken
our
obligations
in
that
sma
matter
and
we
are
glad
this
rudas
spouse
of
thine
hath
bestowed
her
treasure
on
ane
wha
kens
to
put
it
to
the
profit
of
his
king
and
but
how
the
deil
did
ye
come
by
her
man
in
the
auld
scottish
fashion
my
liege
she
is
the
captive
of
my
bow
and
my
spear
answered
moniplies
there
was
a
convention
that
she
should
wed
me
when
i
avenged
her
father
death
so
i
slew
and
took
it
is
the
daughter
of
old
trapbois
who
has
been
missed
so
long
said
where
the
devil
could
you
mew
her
up
so
closely
friend
richie
master
richard
if
it
be
your
will
answered
richie
or
master
richard
moniplies
if
you
like
it
better
for
mewing
of
her
up
i
found
her
a
shelter
in
all
honour
and
safety
under
the
roof
of
an
honest
countryman
of
my
own
and
for
secrecy
it
was
a
point
of
prudence
when
wantons
like
you
were
abroad
master
there
was
a
laugh
at
richie
magnanimous
reply
on
the
part
of
every
one
but
his
bride
who
made
to
him
a
signal
of
impatience
and
said
with
her
usual
brevity
and
sternness
peace
peace
i
pray
you
peace
let
us
do
that
which
we
came
so
saying
she
took
out
a
bundle
of
parchments
and
delivering
them
to
lord
glenvarloch
she
said
aloud
i
take
this
royal
presence
and
all
here
to
witness
that
i
restore
the
ransomed
lordship
of
glenvarloch
to
the
right
owner
as
free
as
ever
it
was
held
by
any
of
his
i
witnessed
the
redemption
of
the
mortgage
said
lowestoffe
but
i
little
dreamt
by
whom
it
had
been
no
need
ye
should
said
richie
there
would
have
been
small
wisdom
in
crying
peace
said
his
bride
once
this
paper
she
continued
delivering
another
to
lord
glenvarloch
is
also
your
property
take
it
but
spare
me
the
question
how
it
came
into
my
the
king
had
bustled
forward
beside
lord
glenvarloch
and
fixing
an
eager
eye
on
the
writing
exclaimed
body
of
ourselves
it
is
our
royal
for
the
money
which
was
so
long
out
of
sight
how
came
you
by
it
mistress
bride
it
is
a
secret
said
martha
dryly
a
secret
which
my
tongue
shall
never
utter
said
richie
resolutely
unless
the
king
commands
me
on
my
i
do
i
do
command
you
said
james
trembling
and
stammering
with
the
impatient
curiosity
of
a
gossip
while
sir
mungo
with
more
malicious
anxiety
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
stooped
his
long
thin
form
forward
like
a
bent
raised
his
thin
grey
locks
from
his
ear
and
curved
his
hand
behind
it
to
collect
every
vibration
of
the
expected
intelligence
martha
in
the
meantime
frowned
most
ominously
on
richie
who
went
on
undauntedly
to
inform
the
king
that
his
deceased
a
good
careful
man
in
the
main
had
a
touch
of
worldly
wisdom
about
him
that
at
times
marred
the
uprightness
of
his
walk
he
liked
to
dabble
among
his
neighbour
gear
and
some
of
it
would
at
times
stick
to
his
fingers
in
the
for
shame
man
for
shame
said
martha
since
the
infamy
of
the
deed
must
be
told
be
it
at
least
yes
my
lord
she
added
addressing
glenvarloch
the
piece
of
gold
was
not
the
sole
bait
which
brought
the
miserable
old
man
to
your
chamber
that
dreadful
night
his
object
and
he
accomplished
it
was
to
purloin
this
paper
the
wretched
scrivener
was
with
him
that
morning
and
i
doubt
not
urged
the
doting
old
man
to
this
villainy
to
offer
another
bar
to
the
ransom
of
your
estate
if
there
was
a
yet
more
powerful
agent
at
the
bottom
of
this
conspiracy
god
forgive
it
to
him
at
this
moment
for
he
is
now
where
the
crime
must
be
answered
amen
said
lord
glenvarloch
and
it
was
echoed
by
all
present
for
my
father
continued
she
with
her
stern
features
twitched
by
an
involuntary
and
convulsive
movement
his
guilt
and
folly
cost
him
his
life
and
my
belief
is
constant
that
the
wretch
who
counselled
him
that
morning
to
purloin
the
paper
left
open
the
window
for
the
entrance
of
the
every
body
was
silent
for
an
instant
the
king
was
first
to
speak
commanding
search
instantly
to
be
made
for
the
guilty
scrivener
lictor
he
concluded
manus
caput
suspendite
lowestoffe
answered
with
due
respect
that
the
scrivener
had
absconded
at
the
time
of
lord
dalgarno
murder
and
had
not
been
heard
of
since
let
him
be
sought
for
said
the
king
and
now
let
us
change
the
discourse
these
stories
make
one
very
blood
grew
and
are
altogether
unfit
for
bridal
festivity
hymen
o
hymenee
added
he
snapping
his
fingers
lord
glenvarloch
what
say
you
to
mistress
moniplies
this
bonny
bride
that
has
brought
you
back
your
father
estate
on
your
bridal
day
let
him
say
nothing
my
liege
said
martha
that
will
best
suit
his
feelings
and
there
is
at
the
least
to
be
repaid
said
lord
glenvarloch
in
that
i
can
not
remain
we
will
speak
of
it
hereafter
said
martha
debtor
can
not
and
she
shut
her
mouth
as
if
determined
to
say
nothing
more
on
the
subject
sir
mungo
however
resolved
not
to
part
with
the
topic
and
availing
himself
of
the
freedom
of
the
moment
said
to
richie
a
queer
story
that
of
your
honest
man
methinks
your
bride
thanked
you
little
for
ripping
it
i
make
it
a
rule
sir
mungo
replied
richie
always
to
speak
any
evil
i
know
about
my
family
myself
having
observed
that
if
i
do
not
it
is
sure
to
be
told
by
ither
but
richie
said
sir
mungo
it
seems
to
me
that
this
bride
of
yours
is
like
to
be
master
and
mair
in
the
conjugal
if
she
abides
by
words
sir
mungo
answered
richie
i
thank
heaven
i
can
be
as
deaf
as
any
one
and
if
she
comes
to
dunts
i
have
twa
hands
to
paik
her
weel
said
richie
again
said
the
king
you
have
gotten
it
on
baith
haffits
sir
troth
mistress
bride
for
a
fule
your
gudeman
has
a
pretty
turn
of
there

fools
sire
replied
she
who
have
wit
and
fools
who
have
courage
aye
and
fools
who
have
learning
and
are
great
fools
i
chose
this
man
because
he
was
my
protector
when
i
was
desolate
and
neither
for
his
wit
nor
his
wisdom
he
is
truly
honest
and
has
a
heart
and
hand
that
make
amends
for
some
folly
since
i
was
condemned
to
seek
a
protector
through
the
world
which
is
to
me
a
wilderness
i
may
thank
god
that
i
have
come
by
no
and
that
is
sae
sensibly
said
replied
the
king
that
by
my
saul
i
try
whether
i
canna
make
him
better
kneel
down
richie
somebody
lend
me
a
rapier
yours
langstaff
that
a
brave
name
for
a
lawyer
ye
need
not
flash
it
out
that
gate
templar
fashion
as
if
ye
were
about
to
pink
a
bailiff
he
took
the
drawn
sword
and
with
averted
eyes
for
it
was
a
sight
he
loved
not
to
look
on
endeavoured
to
lay
it
on
richie
shoulder
but
nearly
stuck
it
into
his
eye
richie
starting
back
attempted
to
rise
but
was
held
down
by
lowestoffe
while
sir
mungo
guiding
the
royal
weapon
the
blow
was
given
and
received

up
sir

moniplies
of

my

let
us
all
to
our

for
the

note
p
david
ramsay
david
ramsay
watchmaker
and
horologer
to
james
was
a
real
person
though
the
author
has
taken
the
liberty
of
pressing
him
into
the
service
of
fiction
although
his
profession
led
him
to
cultivate
the
exact
sciences
like
many
at
this
period
he
mingled
them
with
pursuits
which
were
mystical
and
fantastic
the
truth
was
that
the
boundaries
between
truth
and
falsehood
in
mathematics
astronomy
and
similar
pursuits
were
not
exactly
known
and
there
existed
a
sort
of
between
them
in
which
the
wisest
men
bewildered
themselves
david
ramsay
risked
his
money
on
the
success
of
the
vaticinations
which
his
researches
led
him
to
form
since
he
sold
clocks
and
watches
under
condition
that
their
value
should
not
become
payable
till
king
james
was
crowned
in
the
pope
chair
at
rome
such
wagers
were
common
in
that
day
as
may
be
seen
by
looking
at
jonson
every
man
out
of
his
humour
david
ramsay
was
also
an
actor
in
another
singular
scene
in
which
the
notorious
astrologer
lilly
was
a
performer
and
had
no
small
expectation
on
the
occasion
since
he
brought
with
him
a
sack
to
put
the
treasure
in
david
ramsay
his
majesty
had
been
informed
that
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
treasure
buried
in
the
cloister
of
westminster
abbey
he
acquaints
dean
withnam
therewith
who
was
also
then
bishop
of
lincoln
the
dean
gave
him
liberty
to
search
after
it
with
this
proviso
that
if
any
was
discovered
his
church
should
have
a
share
of
it
davy
ramsay
finds
out
one
john
scott
who
pretended
the
use
of
the
mosaical
rods
to
assist
him
herein
footnote
the
same
now
called
i
believe
the
divining
rod
and
applied
to
the
discovery
of
water
not
obvious
to
the
eye
i
was
desired
to
join
with
him
unto
which
i
consented
one
winter
night
davy
ramsay
with
several
gentlemen
myself
and
scott
entered
the
cloisters
we
played
the
hazel
rods
round
about
the
cloisters
upon
the
west
end
of
the
cloisters
the
rods
turned
one
over
another
an
argument
that
the
treasure
was
there
the
labourers
digged
at
least
six
feet
deep
and
then
we
met
with
a
coffin
but
which
in
regard
it
was
not
heavy
we
did
not
open
which
we
afterwards
much
repented
from
the
cloisters
we
went
into
the
abbey
church
where
upon
a
sudden
there
being
no
wind
when
we
began
so
fierce
and
so
high
so
blustering
and
loud
a
wind
did
rise
that
we
verily
believed
the
west
end
of
the
church
would
have
fallen
upon
us
our
rods
would
not
move
at
all
the
candles
and
torches
also
but
one
were
extinguished
or
burned
very
dimly
john
scott
my
partner
was
amazed
looked
pale
knew
not
what
to
think
or
do
until
i
gave
directions
and
command
to
dismiss
the
demons
which
when
done
all
was
quiet
again
and
each
man
returned
unto
his
lodging
late
about
twelve
at
night
i
could
never
since
be
induced
to
join
with
any
such
like
actions
the
true
miscarriage
of
the
business
was
by
reason
of
so
many
people
being
present
at
the
operation
for
there
was
about
thirty
some
laughing
others
deriding
us
so
that
if
we
had
not
dismissed
the
demons
i
believe
most
part
of
the
abbey
church
would
have
been
blown
down
secrecy
and
intelligent
operators
with
a
strong
confidence
and
knowledge
of
what
they
are
doing
are
best
for
the
lilly
and
david
ramsay
had
a
son
called
william
ramsay
who
appears
to
have
possessed
all
his
father
credulity
he
became
an
astrologer
and
in
published
an
introduction
to
the
judgment
of
eclipses
and
the
annual
revolutions
of
the
the
edition
of
is
inscribed
to
his
father
it
would
appear
as
indeed
it
might
be
argued
from
his
mode
of
disposing
of
his
goods
that
the
old
horologer
had
omitted
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
for
his
son
in
his
dedication
has
this
exception
to
the
paternal
virtues
it
true
your
carelessness
in
laying
up
while
the
sun
shone
for
the
tempests
of
a
stormy
day
hath
given
occasion
to
some
inferior
spirited
people
not
to
value
you
according
to
what
you
are
by
nature
and
in
yourself
for
such
look
not
to
a
man
longer
than
he
is
in
prosperity
esteeming
none
but
for
their
wealth
not
wisdom
power
nor
from
these
expressions
it
is
to
be
apprehended
that
while
old
david
ramsay
a
follower
of
the
stewarts
sunk
under
the
parliamentary
government
his
son
william
had
advanced
from
being
a
dupe
to
astrology
to
the
dignity
of
being
himself
a
cheat
note
ii
heriot
this
excellent
person
was
but
little
known
by
his
actions
when
alive
but
we
may
well
use
in
this
particular
the
striking
phrase
of
scripture
that
being
dead
he
yet
we
have
already
mentioned
in
the
introduction
the
splendid
charity
of
which
he
was
the
founder
the
few
notices
of
his
personal
history
are
slight
and
meagre
george
heriot
was
born
at
trabroun
in
the
parish
of
gladsmuir
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
goldsmith
in
edinburgh
descended
from
a
family
of
some
consequence
in
east
lothian
his
father
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
his
and
was
their
representative
in
parliament
he
was
besides
one
of
the
deputies
sent
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
to
propitiate
the
king
when
he
had
left
edinburgh
abruptly
after
the
riot
of
december
george
heriot
the
son
pursued
his
father
occupation
of
a
goldsmith
then
peculiarly
lucrative
and
much
connected
with
that
of
a
he
enjoyed
the
favour
and
protection
of
james
and
of
his
consort
anne
of
denmark
he
married
for
his
first
wife
a
maiden
of
his
own
rank
named
christian
marjoribanks
daughter
of
a
respectable
burgess
this
was
in
he
was
afterwards
named
jeweller
to
the
queen
whose
account
to
him
for
a
space
of
ten
years
amounted
to
nearly
george
heriot
having
lost
his
wife
connected
himself
with
the
distinguished
house
of
rosebery
by
marrying
a
daughter
of

to
the
privy
council
of

he
was
deprived
by
her
dying
in

before
attaining
her

after
a
life
spent
in
honourable
and
successful
industry
george
heriot
died
in
london
to
which
city
he
had
followed
his
royal
master
on
the
february
at
the
age
of
years
his
picture
copied
by
scougal
from
a
lost
original
in
which
he
is
represented
in
the
prime
of
life
is
thus
described
his
fair
hair
which
overshades
the
thoughtful
brow
and
calm
calculating
eye
with
the
cast
of
humour
on
the
lower
part
of
the
countenance
are
all
indicative
of
the
genuine
scottish
character
and
well
distinguish
a
person
fitted
to
move
steadily
and
wisely
through
the
world
with
a
strength
of
resolution
to
ensure
success
and
a
disposition
to
enjoy
and
descriptive
account
of

hospital
with
a
memoir
of
the

i
may
add
as
every
thing
concerning
george

proclamation
against

coming
to

the
english
agreed
in
nothing
more
unanimously
than
in
censuring
james
on
account
of
the
beggarly
rabble
which
not
only
attended
the
king
at
his
coming
first
out
of
scotland
but
says
osborne
which
through
his
whole
reign
like
a
fluent
spring
were
found
still
crossing
the
yet
it
is
certain
from
the
number
of
proclamations
published
by
the
privy
council
in
scotland
and
bearing
marks
of
the
own
diction
that
he
was
sensible
of
the
whole
inconveniences
and
unpopularity
attending
the
importunate
crowd
of
disrespectable
suitors
and
as
desirous
to
get
rid
of
them
as
his
southern
subjects
could
be
but
it
was
in
vain
that
his
majesty
argued
with
his
scottish
subjects
on
the
disrespect
they
were
bringing
on
their
native
country
and
sovereign
by
causing
the
english
to
suppose
there
were
no
or
independent
gentry
in
scotland
they
who
presented
themselves
being
in
the
opinion
and
conceit
of
all
beholders
but
idle
rascals
and
poor
miserable
it
was
even
in
vain
that
the
vessels
which
brought
up
this
unwelcome
cargo
of
petitioners
were
threatened
with
fine
and
confiscation
the
undaunted
suitors
continued
to
press
forward
and
as
one
of
the
proclamations
says
many
of
them
under
pretence
of
requiring
payment
of
auld
debts
due
to
them
by
the

is
observed
with

the
dress
of
this
monarch
together
with
his
personal
appearance
is
thus
described
by
a
contemporary
he
was
of
a
middle
stature
more
corpulent
through
by
means
of
his
clothes
than
in
his
body
yet
fat
enough
his
legs
were
very
weak
having
had
as
was
thought
some
foul
play
in
his
youth
or
rather
before
he
was
born
that
he
was
not
able
to
stand
at
seven
years
of
age
that
weakness
made
him
ever
leaning
on
other
men
shoulders
his
walk
was
even
circular
his
hands
are
in
that
walk
ever
fiddling
about
a
part
of
dress
now
laid
aside
he
would
make
a
great
deal
too
bold
with
god
in
his
passion
both
with
cursing
and
swearing
and
a
strain
higher
verging
on
blasphemy
but
would
in
his
better
temper
say
he
hoped
god
would
not
impute
them
as
sins
and
lay
them
to
his
charge
seeing
they
proceeded
from
passion
he
had
need
of
great
assistance
rather
than
hope
that
would
daily
make
thus
bold
with
dalzell
of
scottish
history
note
p
sir
mungo
malagrowther
it
will
perhaps
be
recognised
by
some
of
my
countrymen
that
the
caustic
scottish
knight
as
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
borrowed
some
of
his
attributes
from
a
most
worthy
and
respectable
baronet
who
was
to
be
met
with
in
edinburgh
society
about
or
thirty
years
ago
it
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
inferred
that
the
living
person
resembled
the
imaginary
one
in
the
course
of
life
ascribed
to
him
or
in
his
personal
attributes
but
his
fortune
was
little
adequate
to
his
rank
and
the
antiquity
of
his
family
and
to
avenge
himself
of
this
disparity
the
worthy
baronet
lost
no
opportunity
of
making
the
more
avowed
sons
of
fortune
feel
the
edge
of
his
satire
this
he
had
the
art
of
disguising
under
the
personal
infirmity
of
deafness
and
usually
introduced
his
most
severe
things
by
an
affected
mistake
of
what
was
said
around
him
for
example
at
a
public
meeting
of
a
certain
county
this
worthy
gentleman
had
chosen
to
display
a
laced
coat
of
such
a
pattern
as
had
not
been
seen
in
society
for
the
better
part
of
a
century
the
young
men
who
were
present
amused
themselves
with
rallying
him
on
his
taste
when
he
suddenly
singled
out
one
of
the
party
auld
d
think
my
coat
indeed
it
canna
be
new
but
it
was
the
wark
of
a
braw
tailor
and
that
was
your
grandfather
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
trade
in
edinburgh
about
the
beginning
of

upon
another
occasion
when
this
type
of
sir
mungo
malagrowther
happened
to
hear
a
nobleman
the
high
chief
of
one
of
those
border
clans
who
were
accused
of
paying
very
little
attention
in
ancient
times
to
the
distinctions
of
and
addressing
a
gentleman
of
the
same
name
as
if
conjecturing
there
should
be
some
relationship
between
them
he
volunteered
to
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
connexion
by
saying
that
the
chief
ancestors
had
the
cows
and
the
other
ancestors
had
them
fame
ascribing
the
origin
of
the
latter
family
to
a
butcher

may
be
well
imagined
that
among
a
people
that
have
been
always
punctilious
about
genealogy

acquaintance

to
make
this
more
plain
and
certain
we
shall
add
a
story
of
a
notable
impostor
or
ventriloquist
from
the
testimony
of
ady
which
we
have
had
confirmed
from
the
mouth
of
some
courtiers
that
both
saw
and
knew
him
and
is
this
it
hath
been
saith
he
credibly
reported
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
court
of
king
james
his
days
that
could
act
this
imposture
so
lively
that
he
could
call
the
king
by
name
and
cause
the
king
to
look
round
about
him
wondering
who
it
was
that
called
him
whereas
he
that
called
him
stood
before
him
in
his
presence
with
his
face
towards
him
but
after
this
imposture
was
known
the
king
in
his
merriment
would
sometimes
take
occasionally
this
impostor
to
make
sport
upon
some
of
his
courtiers
as
for
instance
there
was
a
knight
belonging
to
the
court
whom
the
king
caused
to
come
before
him
in
his
private
room
where
no
man
was
but
the
king
and
this
knight
and
the
impostor
and
feigned
some
occasion
of
serious
discourse
with
the
knight
but
when
the
king
began
to
speak
and
the
knight
bending
his
attention
to
the
king
suddenly
there
came
a
voice
as
out
of
another
room
calling
the
knight
by
name
john
sir
john
come
away
sir
john
at
which
the
knight
began
to
frown
that
any
man
should
be
unmannerly
as
to
molest
the
king
and
him
and
still
listening
to
the
king
discourse
the
voice
came
again
john
sir
john
come
away
and
drink
off
your
sack
at
that
sir
john
began
to
swell
with
anger
and
looked
into
the
next
room
to
see
who
it
was
that
dared
to
call
him
so
importunately
and
could
not
find
out
who
it
was
and
having
chid
with
whomsoever
he
found
he
returned
again
to
the
king
the
king
had
no
sooner
begun
to
speak
as
formerly
but
the
voice
came
again
john
come
away

sack
stayeth
for
you
at
that
sir
john
began
to
stamp
with
madness
and
looked
out
and
returned
several
times
to
the

but
could
not
be
quiet
in

wilson
expression
took
delight
in
sounding
with
the
line
of
his
understanding
the
depths
of
these
brutish
impositions
and
in
doing
so
showed
the
acuteness
with
which
he
was
endowed
by
nature
lady
lake
story
consisted
in
a
clamorous
complaint
against
the
countess
of
exeter
whom
she
accused
of
a
purpose
to
put
to
death
lady
lake
herself
and
her
daughter
lady
ross
the
wife
of
the
countess
own
lord
ross
and
a
forged
letter
was
produced
in
which
lady
exeter
was
made
to
acknowledge
such
a
purpose
the
account
given
of
the
occasion
of
obtaining
this
letter
was
that
it
had
been
written
by
the
countess
at
wimbledon
in
presence
of
lady
lake
and
her
daughter
lady
ross
being
designed
to
procure
their
forgiveness
for
her
mischievous
intention
the
king
remained
still
unsatisfied
the
writing
in
his
opinion
bearing
some
marks
of
forgery
lady
lake
and
her
daughter
then
alleged
that
besides
their
own
attestation
and
that
of
a
confidential
domestic
named
diego
in
whose
presence
lady
exeter
had
written
the
confession
their
story
might
also
be
supported
by
the
oath
of
their
who
had
been
placed
behind
the
hangings
at
the
time
the
letter
was
written
and
heard
the
countess
of
exeter
read
over
the
confession
after
she
had
signed
it
determined
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
accusation
james
while
hunting
one
day
near
wimbledon
the
scene
of
the
alleged
confession
suddenly
left
his
sport
and
galloping
hastily
to
wimbledon
in
order
to
examine
personally
the
room
discovered
from
the
size
of
the
apartment
that
the
alleged
conversation
could
not
have
taken
place
in
the
manner
sworn
to
and
that
the
tapestry
of
the
chamber
which
had
remained
in
the
same
state
for
thirty
years
was
too
short
by
two
feet
and
therefore
could
not
have
concealed
any
one
behind
it
this
matter
was
accounted
an
exclusive
discovery
of
the
king
by
his
own
spirit
of
shrewd
investigation
the
parties
were
punished
in
