i
have
learned
to
look
on
nature
not
as
in
the
hour
of
thoughtless
youth
but
hearing
oftentimes
the
sad
still
music
of
humanity
not
harsh
or
grating
though
of
ample
power
to
chasten
and
subdue
and
i
have
felt
a
presence
that
disturbs
me
with
the
joy
of
elevated
thoughts
a
sense
sublime
of
something
far
more
deeply
interfused
whose
dwelling
is
in
the
lights
of
setting
suns
and
the
round
ocean
and
the
living
air
and
the
blue
sky
and
in
the
mind
of
man
a
motion
and
a
spirit
that
impels
all
thinking
things
all
objects
of
all
thoughts
and
rolls
through
all
things
therefore
am
i
still
a
lover
of
the
meadows
and
the
woods
and
mountains
and
this
prayer
i
make
knowing
that
nature
never
did
betray
the
heart
that
loved
her
is
her
privilege
through
all
the
years
of
this
one
life
to
lead
from
joy
to
joy
for
she
can
so
inform
the
mind
that
is
within
us
so
impress
with
quietness
and
beauty
and
so
feed
with
lofty
thoughts
that
neither
evil
tongues
rash
judgments
nor
the
sneers
of
selfish
men
nor
greetings
where
no
kindness
is
nor
all
the
dreary
intercourse
of
daily
life
shalt
prevail
against
us
or
disturb
our
cheerful
faith

chapter
i
his
inheritance
it
was
winter
cold
and
snow
and
ice
and
naked
trees
and
leaden
clouds
and
stinging
wind
the
house
was
an
ancient
mansion
on
an
old
street
in
that
city
of
culture
which
has
given
to
the
history
of
our
nation
to
education
to
religion
to
the
sciences
and
to
the
arts
so
many
illustrious
names
in
the
changing
years
before
the
beginning
of
my
story
the
immediate
friends
and
associates
had
moved
from
the
neighborhood
to
the
newer
and
more
fashionable
districts
of
a
younger
generation
in
that
city
of
her
father
there
were
few
of
her
old
companions
left
there
were
fewer
who
remembered
the
distinguished
leaders
in
the
world
of
art
and
letters
whose
voices
had
been
so
often
heard
within
the
walls
of
her
home
had
one
by
one
passed
on
leaving
their
works
and
their
names
to
their
children
the
children
in
the
greedy
rush
of
these
younger
times
had
too
readily
forgotten
the
woman
who
to
the
culture
and
genius
of
a
passing
day
had
been
hostess
and
friend
the
apartment
was
pitifully
bare
and
empty
ruthlessly
it
had
been
stripped
of
its
treasures
of
art
and
its
proud
luxuries
but
even
in
its
naked
necessities
the
room
managed
still
to
evidence
the
rare
intelligence
and
the
exquisite
refinement
of
its
dying
tenant
the
face
upon
the
pillow
so
wasted
by
sickness
was
marked
by
the
the
eyes
deep
in
their
hollows
between
the
fleshless
forehead
and
the
prominent
were
closed
the
lips
were
livid
the
nose
was
sharp
and
pinched
the
colorless
cheeks
were
sunken
but
the
outlines
were
still
delicately
drawn
and
the
proportions
nobly
fashioned
it
was
still
the
face
of
a
gentlewoman
in
the
ashen
lips
only
was
there
a
sign
of
life
and
they
trembled
and
fluttered
in
their
effort
to
utter
the
words
that
an
indomitable
spirit
gave
them
to
speak
he
will
come
the
voice
was
a
thin
broken
whisper
but
colored
still
with
pride
and
gladness
a
young
woman
in
the
uniform
of
a
trained
nurse
turned
quickly
from
the
window
with
soft
professional
step
she
crossed
the
room
to
bend
over
the
bed
her
trained
fingers
sought
the
skeleton
wrist
she
spoke
slowly
distinctly
with
careful
clearness
and
under
the
cool
professionalism
of
her
words
there
was
a
tone
of
marked
respect
what
is
it
madam
the
sunken
eyes
opened
as
a
burst
of
sunlight
through
the
suddenly
opened
doors
of
a
sepulchre
the
face
was
illumed
in
those
eyes
clear
and
burning
the
nurse
saw
all
that
remained
of
a
powerful
personality
in
their
shadowy
depths
she
saw
the
last
glowing
embers
of
the
vital
fire
gathered
carefully
nursed
and
tended
kept
alive
by
a
will
that
was
clinging
with
almost
superhuman
tenacity
to
a
definite
purpose
dying
this
woman
not
die
not
die
until
the
end
for
which
she
willed
to
live
should
be
accomplished
in
the
very
grasp
of
death
she
was
forcing
death
to
stay
his
hand
without
life
she
was
holding
death
at
bay
it
was
magnificent
and
the
gentle
face
under
the
nurse
cap
shone
with
appreciation
and
admiration
as
she
smiled
her
sympathy
and
understanding
my
son
my
son
will
come
the
voice
was
stronger
and
with
the
eyes
expressed
a
conviction
a
certainty
with
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
question
the
nurse
looked
at
her
watch
the
boat
was
due
in
new
york
early
this
morning
madam
a
step
sounded
in
the
hall
outside
the
nurse
started
and
turned
quickly
toward
the
door
but
the
woman
said
the
doctor
and
again
the
fire
that
burned
in
those
sunken
eyes
was
hidden
wearily
under
their
dark
lids
the
physician
and
the
nurse
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
spoke
together
in
low
tones
said
the
physician
incredulous
you
say
there
is
no
change
none
that
i
can
detect
breathed
the
nurse
it
is
wonderful
her
mind
is
clear
as
though
she
were
in
perfect
health
the
doctor
took
the
nurse
chart
for
a
moment
he
studied
it
in
silence
he
gave
it
back
with
a
gesture
of
amazement
god
nurse
he
whispered
she
should
be
in
her
grave
by
now
it
a
miracle
but
she
has
always
been
like
that
he
continued
half
to
himself
looking
with
troubled
admiration
toward
the
bed
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
always
he
went
slowly
forward
to
the
chair
that
the
nurse
placed
for
him
seating
himself
quietly
beside
his
patient
and
bending
forward
with
intense
interest
his
fine
old
head
bowed
he
regarded
with
more
than
professional
care
the
wasted
face
upon
the
pillow
the
doctor
remembered
too
well
when
those
finely
moulded
features
now
so
worn
by
sorrow
so
marked
by
sickness
so
ghastly
in
the
hue
of
death
were
rounded
with
health
and
tinted
with
rare
loveliness
he
recalled
that
day
when
he
saw
her
a
bride
he
remembered
the
sweet
proud
dignity
of
her
young
wifehood
he
saw
her
again
when
her
face
shone
with
the
glad
triumph
and
the
holy
joy
of
motherhood
the
old
physician
turned
from
his
patient
to
look
with
sorrowful
eyes
about
the
room
that
was
to
witness
the
end
why
was
such
a
woman
dying
like
this
why
was
a
life
of
such
rich
mental
and
spiritual
endowments
of
such
wealth
of
true
culture
coming
to
its
close
in
such
material
poverty
the
doctor
was
one
of
the
few
who
knew
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
understood
that
to
the
woman
herself
it
was
necessary
there
were
those
who
without
understanding
for
the
sake
of
the
years
that
were
gone
would
have
surrounded
her
with
the
material
comforts
to
which
in
her
younger
days
she
had
been
accustomed
the
doctor
knew
that
there
was
one
a
friend
of
her
childhood
famous
now
in
the
world
of
books
who
would
have
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
care
for
her
all
that
a
human
being
could
do
for
her
in
those
days
of
her
life
tragedy
that
one
had
done
then
because
he
understood
he
had
gone
away
her
own
son
did
not
know
could
not
in
his
young
manhood
have
understood
if
he
had
known
would
not
understand
when
he
came
perhaps
some
day
he
would
understand
perhaps
when
the
physician
turned
again
toward
the
bed
to
touch
with
gentle
fingers
the
wrist
of
his
patient
his
eyes
were
wet
at
his
touch
her
eyes
opened
to
regard
him
with
affectionate
trust
and
gratitude
well
mary
he
said
almost
bruskly
the
lips
fashioned
the
ghost
of
a
smile
into
her
eyes
came
the
gleam
of
that
old
time
challenging
spirit
well
doctor
george
she
answered
then
i
told
you
i
would
not
go
until
he
came
i
must
have
my
way
still
you
see
he
will
come
he
must
come
yes
mary
returned
the
doctor
his
fingers
still
on
the
thin
wrist
and
his
eyes
studying
her
face
with
professional
keenness
yes
of
course
and
george
you
will
not
forget
your
promise
you
will
give
me
a
few
minutes
of
strength
when
he
comes
so
that
i
can
tell
him
i
i
must
tell
him
myself
george
you
will
do
this
last
thing
for
me
yes
mary
of
course
he
answered
again
everything
shall
be
as
you
wish
as
i
promised
thank
you
george
thank
you
my
dear
dear
old
friend
the
nurse
who
had
been
standing
at
the
window
stepped
quickly
to
the
table
that
held
a
few
bottles
glasses
and
instruments
the
doctor
looked
at
her
sharply
she
nodded
a
silent
answer
as
she
opened
a
small
flat
leather
case
with
his
fingers
still
on
his
patient
wrist
the
physician
spoke
a
word
of
instruction
and
in
a
moment
the
nurse
placed
a
hypodermic
needle
in
his
hand
as
the
doctor
gave
the
instrument
again
to
his
assistant
a
quick
step
sounded
in
the
hall
outside
the
patient
turned
her
head
her
eager
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
door
her
voice
stronger
now
with
the
strength
of
the
powerful
stimulant
rang
out
my
boy
my
boy
he
is
here
george
nurse
my
boy
is
here
the
door
opened
a
young
man
of
perhaps
years
stood
on
the
threshold
the
most
casual
observer
would
have
seen
that
he
was
a
son
of
the
dying
woman
in
the
full
flush
of
his
young
manhood
vigor
there
was
the
same
modeling
of
the
mouth
the
same
nose
with
finely
turned
nostrils
the
same
dark
eyes
under
a
breadth
of
forehead
while
the
determined
chin
and
the
jaw
together
with
a
rather
remarkable
fineness
of
line
told
of
an
inherited
mental
and
spiritual
strength
and
grace
as
charming
as
it
is
in
these
days
rare
his
dress
was
that
of
a
gentleman
of
culture
and
social
position
his
very
bearing
evidenced
that
he
had
never
been
without
means
to
gratify
the
legitimate
tastes
of
a
cultivated
and
refined
intelligence
as
he
paused
an
instant
in
the
open
door
to
glance
about
that
poverty
stricken
room
a
look
of
bewildering
amazement
swept
over
his
handsome
face
he
started
to
draw
back
as
if
he
had
unintentionally
entered
the
wrong
apartment
looking
at
the
doctor
his
lips
parted
as
if
to
apologize
for
his
intrusion
but
before
he
could
speak
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
woman
on
the
bed
with
a
cry
of
horror
he
sprang
forward
mother
mother
as
he
knelt
there
by
the
bed
when
the
first
moments
of
their
meeting
were
past
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
doctor
from
the
physician
his
gaze
went
to
the
nurse
then
back
again
to
his
mother
old
friend
his
eyes
were
burning
with
shame
and
sorrow
with
pain
and
doubt
and
accusation
his
low
voice
was
tense
with
emotion
as
he
demanded
what
does
this
mean
why
is
my
mother
here
like
like
this
his
eyes
swept
the
bare
room
again
the
dying
woman
answered
i
will
explain
my
boy
it
is
to
tell
you
that
i
have
waited
at
a
look
from
the
doctor
the
nurse
quietly
followed
the
physician
from
the
room
it
was
not
long
when
she
had
finished
the
false
strength
that
had
kept
the
woman
alive
until
she
had
accomplished
that
which
she
conceived
to
be
her
last
duty
failed
quickly
you
will
promise
you
will
yes
mother
yes
your
education
your
training
your
blood
they
are
all
that
i
can
give
you
my
son
o
mother
mother
why
did
you
not
tell
me
before
why
did
i
not
know
the
cry
was
a
protest
an
expression
of
bitterest
shame
and
sorrow
she
smiled
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
for
you
my
son
the
only
way
i
could
help
i
do
not
regret
the
cost
you
will
not
forget
never
mother
never
you
promise
to
to
regain
that
which
your
father
solemnly
the
answer
came
in
an
agony
of
devotion
and
love
i
promise
yes
mother
i
promise
a
month
later
the
young
man
was
traveling
as
fast
as
modern
steam
and
steel
could
carry
him
toward
the
western
edge
of
the
continent
he
was
flying
from
the
city
of
his
birth
as
from
a
place
accursed
he
had
set
his
face
toward
a
new
land
determined
to
work
out
there
his
promise
the
promise
that
he
did
not
at
the
first
understand
how
he
misunderstood
how
he
attempted
to
use
his
inheritance
to
carry
out
what
he
first
thought
was
his
mother
wish
and
how
he
came
at
last
to
understand
is
the
story
that
i
have
to
tell
chapter
ii
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
the
golden
state
limited
with
two
laboring
engines
was
climbing
the
desert
side
of
san
gorgonio
pass
now
san
gorgonio
pass
as
all
men
should
know
is
one
of
the
two
eastern
gateways
to
the
beautiful
heart
of
southern
california
it
is
therefore
the
gateway
to
the
scenes
of
my
story
as
the
heavy
train
zigzagged
up
the
long
barren
slope
of
the
mountain
in
its
effort
to
lessen
the
heavy
grade
the
young
man
on
the
platform
of
the
observation
car
could
see
far
to
the
east
the
shimmering
haze
that
lies
always
like
a
veil
of
mystery
over
the
vast
reaches
of
the
colorado
desert
now
and
then
as
the
express
swung
around
the
curves
he
gained
a
view
of
the
lonely
peaks
of
the
san
bernardinos
with
old
san
gorgonio
lifting
above
the
ridges
of
the
lower
galenas
shining
silvery
white
against
the
blue
again
on
the
southern
side
of
the
pass
he
saw
san
jacinto
crags
and
cliffs
rising
almost
sheer
from
the
but
the
man
watching
the
panorama
of
gorgeously
colored
and
fantastically
unreal
landscape
was
not
thinking
of
the
scenes
that
to
him
were
new
and
strange
his
thoughts
were
far
away
among
those
mountains
grouped
about
san
gorgonio
the
real
value
of
the
inheritance
he
had
received
from
his
mother
was
to
be
tested
on
the
ridge
of
the
galenas
among
those
granite
cliffs
and
jagged
peaks
the
mettle
of
his
manhood
was
to
be
tried
under
a
strain
such
as
few
men
in
this
commonplace
old
world
to
but
the
young
man
did
not
know
this
on
the
long
journey
across
the
continent
he
had
paid
little
heed
to
the
sights
that
so
interested
his
fellow
passengers
to
his
fellow
passengers
themselves
he
had
been
as
indifferent
to
those
who
had
approached
him
casually
as
the
sometimes
tedious
hours
passed
he
had
been
quietly
and
courteously
unresponsive
this
but
decidedly
marked
disinclination
to
mingle
with
them
together
with
the
undeniably
distinguished
appearance
of
the
young
man
only
served
to
center
the
interest
of
the
little
world
of
the
pullmans
more
strongly
upon
him
keeping
to
himself
and
engrossed
with
his
own
thoughts
he
became
the
object
of
many
idle
conjectures
among
the
passengers
whose
curious
eyes
were
so
often
turned
in
his
direction
there
was
one
whose
interest
was
always
carefully
veiled
she
was
a
woman
of
evident
rank
and
distinction
in
that
world
where
rank
and
distinction
are
determined
wholly
by
dollars
and
by
such
social
position
as
dollars
can
buy
she
was
beautiful
but
with
that
carefully
studied
wholly
one
is
tempted
to
say
professional
beauty
of
her
kind
her
full
rounded
splendidly
developed
body
was
gowned
to
accentuate
the
alluring
curves
of
her
sex
with
such
skill
was
this
deliberate
appeal
to
the
physical
hidden
under
a
cloak
of
a
pretending
modesty
that
its
charm
was
the
more
effectively
revealed
her
features
were
almost
too
perfect
she
was
too
coldly
sure
of
herself
too
perfectly
trained
in
the
art
of
for
a
woman
as
young
as
she
evidently
was
she
seemed
to
know
too
much
the
careful
indifference
of
her
countenance
seemed
to
say
i
am
too
well
schooled
in
life
to
make
mistakes
she
was
traveling
with
two
companions
a
fluffy
fluttering
characterless
shadow
of
womanhood
and
a
man
an
invalid
who
seldom
left
the
privacy
of
the
which
he
occupied
as
the
train
neared
the
summit
of
the
pass
the
young
man
on
the
observation
car
platform
looked
at
his
watch
a
few
miles
more
and
he
would
arrive
at
his
destination
rising
to
his
feet
he
drew
a
deep
breath
of
the
glorious
air
with
his
back
to
the
door
and
looking
away
into
the
distance
he
did
not
notice
the
woman
who
stepping
from
the
car
at
that
moment
stood
directly
behind
him
steadying
herself
by
the
brass
railing
in
front
of
the
window
to
their
idly
observing
fellow
passengers
the
woman
too
appeared
interested
in
the
distant
landscape
she
might
have
been
looking
at
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
platform
the
passengers
from
where
they
sat
could
not
have
told
as
he
stood
there
against
the
background
of
the
primitive
landscape
the
young
man
might
easily
have
attracted
the
attention
of
any
one
he
would
have
attracted
attention
in
a
crowd
tall
with
an
athletic
trimness
of
limb
a
good
breadth
of
shoulder
and
a
fine
head
poised
with
that
natural
unconscious
pride
of
the
he
kept
his
feet
on
the
unsteady
platform
of
the
car
with
that
easy
grace
which
marks
only
muscles
and
is
rarely
seen
save
in
those
whose
lives
are
sanely
clean
the
express
had
entered
the
yards
at
the
summit
station
and
was
gradually
lessening
its
speed
just
as
the
man
turned
to
enter
the
car
the
train
came
to
a
full
stop
and
the
sudden
jar
threw
him
almost
into
the
arms
of
the
woman
for
an
instant
while
he
was
struggling
to
regain
his
balance
he
was
so
close
to
her
that
their
garments
touched
indeed
he
only
prevented
an
actual
collision
by
throwing
his
arm
across
her
shoulder
and
catching
the
side
of
the
car
window
against
which
she
was
leaning
in
that
moment
while
his
face
was
so
close
to
hers
that
she
might
have
felt
his
breath
upon
her
cheek
and
he
was
involuntarily
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
the
man
felt
queerly
that
the
woman
was
not
shrinking
from
him
in
fact
one
less
occupied
with
other
thoughts
might
have
construed
her
bold
open
look
her
slightly
parted
lips
and
flushed
cheeks
as
a
welcome
quite
as
though
she
were
in
the
habit
of
having
handsome
young
men
throw
themselves
into
her
arms
then
with
a
hint
of
a
smile
in
his
eyes
he
was
saying
conventionally
i
beg
your
pardon
it
was
very
stupid
of
me
as
he
spoke
a
mask
of
cold
indifference
slipped
over
her
face
without
deigning
to
notice
his
courteous
apology
she
looked
away
and
moving
to
the
railing
of
the
platform
became
ostensibly
interested
in
the
busy
activity
of
the
railroad
yards
had
the
woman
in
that
instant
when
his
arm
was
over
her
shoulder
and
his
eyes
were
looking
into
hers
smiled
the
incident
would
have
slipped
quickly
from
his
mind
as
it
was
the
impression
of
the
moment
remained
and
down
the
steep
grade
of
the
narrow
san
timateo
canyon
on
the
coast
side
of
the
mountain
pass
the
overland
thundered
on
the
last
stretch
of
its
long
race
to
the
western
edge
of
the
continent
and
now
from
the
car
windows
the
passengers
caught
tantalizing
glimpses
of
bright
pastures
with
their
herds
of
contented
dairy
cows
and
with
their
white
ranch
buildings
set
in
the
shade
of
giant
pepper
and
eucalyptus
trees
on
the
rounded
shoulders
and
steep
flanks
of
the
foothills
that
form
the
sides
of
the
canyon
the
barley
fields
looked
down
upon
the
meadows
and
now
and
then
in
the
whirling
landscape
winding
side
canyons
beautiful
with
and
laurel
with
greasewood
and
sage
led
the
eye
away
toward
the
ridges
of
the
galenas
while
above
the
higher
peaks
and
domes
of
the
san
bernardinos
still
shone
coldly
against
the
blue
in
the
pullman
there
was
a
stir
of
awakening
interest
the
passengers
laying
aside
books
and
magazines
and
cards
renewed
conversations
that
in
the
last
monotonous
hours
of
the
desert
part
of
the
journey
had
lagged
painfully
throughout
the
train
there
was
an
air
of
eager
expectancy
a
bustling
movement
of
preparation
the
woman
of
the
observation
car
platform
had
disappeared
into
her
stateroom
the
young
man
gathered
his
things
together
in
readiness
to
leave
the
train
at
the
next
stop
in
the
flying
pictures
framed
by
the
windows
the
dairy
pastures
and
meadows
were
being
replaced
by
small
vineyards
and
orchards
the
canyon
wall
on
the
northern
side
became
higher
and
steeper
shutting
out
the
mountains
in
the
distance
and
showing
only
a
fringe
of
trees
on
the
sharp
rim
while
against
the
gray
and
yellow
and
brown
and
green
of
the
chaparral
on
the
steep
untilled
bluffs
shone
the
silvery
softness
of
the
olive
trees
that
border
the
arroyo
at
their
feet
with
a
long
triumphant
shriek
the
flying
overland
train
from
the
lands
of
ice
and
snow
from
barren
deserts
and
lonely
mountains
rushed
from
the
narrow
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
swept
out
into
the
beautiful
san
bernardino
valley
where
the
travelers
were
greeted
by
wide
green
miles
of
orange
and
lemon
and
walnut
and
olive
groves
by
many
acres
of
gardens
and
vineyards
and
orchards
amid
these
groves
and
gardens
the
towns
and
cities
are
set
their
streets
and
buildings
half
hidden
in
wildernesses
of
eucalyptus
and
peppers
and
palms
while
towering
above
the
loveliness
of
the
valley
and
visible
now
from
the
sweeping
lines
of
their
foothills
to
the
gleaming
white
of
their
lonely
peaks
rises
in
steeps
and
purple
shaded
canyons
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
the
mountains
it
was
january
to
those
who
had
so
recently
left
the
winter
lands
the
southern
california
scene
so
richly
colored
with
its
many
shades
of
living
green
so
warm
in
its
golden
sunlight
seemed
a
dream
of
fairyland
it
was
as
though
that
break
in
the
mountain
wall
had
ushered
them
suddenly
into
another
world
a
world
strange
indeed
to
eyes
accustomed
to
snow
and
ice
and
naked
trees
and
leaden
clouds
among
the
many
little
cities
half
concealed
in
the
luxurious
verdure
of
the
wide
valley
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
fairlands
if
you
ask
a
citizen
of
that
mecca
of
the
tourist
is
easily
the
queen
as
for
that
all
our
southern
california
cities
are
set
in
wildernesses
of
beauty
all
are
in
wide
valleys
all
are
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
all
are
meccas
for
tourists
each
one
if
you
ask
a
citizen
is
the
queen
if
you
perchance
should
question
this
fact
write
for
our
advertising
literature
passengers
on
the
golden
state
limited
as
perhaps
you
know
do
not
go
direct
to
fairlands
they
change
at
fairlands
junction
the
little
city
itself
is
set
in
the
lap
of
the
hills
that
form
the
southern
side
of
the
valley
some
three
miles
from
the
main
line
it
is
as
though
this
particular
queen
withdrew
from
the
great
highway
traveled
by
the
vulgar
herd
in
the
proud
aloofness
of
her
superior
clay
sufficient
unto
herself
the
soil
out
of
which
fairlands
is
made
is
much
richer
it
is
said
than
the
common
dirt
of
her
sister
cities
less
than
fifteen
miles
distant
a
difference
of
only
a
few
feet
in
elevation
seems
strangely
to
give
her
a
much
more
rarefied
air
her
proudest
boast
is
that
she
has
a
larger
number
of
millionaires
in
proportion
to
her
population
than
any
other
city
in
the
land
it
was
these
peculiar
and
advantages
of
fairlands
that
led
the
young
man
of
my
story
to
select
it
as
the
starting
point
of
his
worthy
ambition
and
fairlands
is
a
good
place
for
one
so
richly
endowed
with
an
inheritance
that
can
not
be
expressed
in
dollars
to
try
his
strength
given
such
a
community
amid
such
surroundings
with
a
man
like
the
young
man
of
my
story
and
something
may
be
depended
upon
to
happen
while
the
travelers
from
the
east
bound
for
fairlands
were
waiting
at
the
junction
for
the
local
train
that
would
take
them
through
the
orange
groves
to
their
journey
end
the
young
man
noticed
the
woman
of
the
observation
car
platform
with
her
two
companions
and
now
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
enjoying
the
exercise
after
the
days
of
confinement
in
the
pullman
he
observed
them
with
stimulated
interest
they
too
were
going
to
fairlands
the
man
of
the
party
though
certainly
not
old
in
years
was
frightfully
aged
by
dissipation
and
disease
the
gross
sensual
mouth
with
its
lips
the
blotched
and
clammy
skin
the
pale
watery
eyes
with
their
inflamed
rims
and
flabby
pouches
the
sunken
chest
skinny
neck
and
limbs
and
the
thin
rasping
voice
all
cried
aloud
the
shame
of
a
misspent
life
it
was
as
clearly
evident
that
he
was
a
man
of
wealth
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
of
an
enviable
social
rank
as
the
young
man
passed
and
repassed
them
where
they
stood
under
the
big
pepper
tree
that
shades
the
depot
the
man
in
his
harsh
throaty
whisper
between
spasms
of
coughing
was
cursing
the
train
service
the
country
the
weather
and
apparently
whatever
else
he
could
think
of
as
being
worthy
or
unworthy
his
impotent
the
shadowy
suggestion
of
womanhood
glancing
toward
the
young
man
was
saying
with
affected
giggles
o
papa
do
oh
is
it
perfectly
lovely
o
papa
do
do
hush
what
will
people
think
this
last
variation
of
his
plaint
must
have
given
the
man
some
satisfaction
at
least
for
it
furnished
him
another
target
for
his
pointless
shafts
and
he
fairly
outdid
himself
in
politely
damning
whoever
might
presume
to
think
anything
at
all
of
him
with
the
net
result
that
two
mexicans
who
were
loafing
near
enough
to
hear
grinned
with
admiring
amusement
the
woman
stood
a
little
apart
from
the
others
coldly
indifferent
alike
to
the
cursing
and
coughing
and
to
the
daughter
ejaculations
she
appeared
to
be
looking
at
the
mountains
but
the
young
man
fancied
that
once
or
twice
as
he
faced
about
at
the
end
of
his
beat
her
eyes
were
turned
in
his
direction
when
the
fairlands
train
came
in
the
three
found
seats
conveniently
turned
near
the
forward
end
of
the
car
the
young
man
in
passing
glanced
down
and
the
woman
who
had
taken
the
chair
next
to
the
aisle
looked
up
full
into
his
face
again
as
their
eyes
met
the
man
felt
as
when
they
had
stood
so
close
together
on
the
platform
of
the
observation
car
that
she
did
not
shrink
from
him
it
was
only
for
an
instant
then
glancing
about
for
a
seat
he
saw
another
face
a
face
in
its
outlines
so
like
the
one
into
which
he
had
just
looked
and
yet
so
different
so
far
removed
in
its
expression
and
meaning
that
it
fixed
his
attention
instantly
compelling
his
interest
as
this
woman
sat
looking
from
the
car
window
away
toward
the
distant
mountain
peaks
the
young
man
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
perfect
profile
nor
a
countenance
that
expressed
such
a
beautiful
blending
of
wistful
longing
of
patient
fortitude
and
saintly
resignation
it
was
the
face
of
a
madonna
but
a
madonna
after
the
crucifixion
pathetic
in
its
lonely
sorrow
inspiring
in
its
spiritual
strength
and
holy
in
its
purity
and
freedom
from
earthly
passions
she
was
near
his
mother
age
and
looking
at
her
as
he
moved
down
the
aisle
his
mother
face
as
he
had
known
it
before
their
last
meeting
came
to
him
with
startling
vividness
for
an
instant
he
paused
moved
to
take
the
chair
beside
her
but
the
next
two
seats
were
vacant
and
he
had
no
excuse
for
intruding
arranging
his
grips
he
quickly
seated
himself
next
to
the
window
and
again
with
eager
interest
turned
toward
the
woman
in
the
chair
ahead
involuntarily
he
started
with
astonishment
and
pity
the
woman
still
gazing
from
the
window
at
the
distant
mountain
peaks
and
seemingly
unconscious
of
her
surroundings
presented
now
to
the
shocked
and
compassionate
gaze
the
other
side
of
her
face
it
was
hideously
disfigured
by
a
great
scar
that
covering
the
entire
cheek
and
neck
distorted
the
corner
of
the
mouth
drew
down
the
lower
lid
of
the
eye
and
twisted
her
features
into
an
ugly
caricature
even
the
ear
half
hidden
under
the
soft
hair
had
not
escaped
but
was
deformed
by
the
same
dreadful
agent
that
had
wrought
such
ruin
to
one
of
the
loveliest
countenances
the
man
had
ever
looked
upon
when
the
train
stopped
at
fairlands
and
the
passengers
crowded
into
the
aisle
to
make
their
way
out
of
the
characters
belonging
to
my
story
the
woman
with
the
man
and
his
daughter
went
first
following
them
a
half
of
people
between
went
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
on
the
depot
platform
as
they
moved
toward
the
street
the
young
man
still
held
his
place
near
the
woman
who
had
so
awakened
his
pitying
interest
the
three
overland
passengers
were
met
by
a
man
who
escorted
them
to
a
luxurious
touring
car
the
invalid
and
his
daughter
had
entered
the
automobile
when
their
escort
in
turning
toward
the
other
member
of
the
party
saw
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
who
was
now
quite
near
instantly
he
paused
and
there
was
a
smile
of
recognition
on
his
somewhat
coarse
features
as
lifting
his
hat
he
bowed
with
the
young
man
fancied
condescending
politeness
the
woman
standing
by
his
side
with
her
hand
upon
the
door
of
the
automobile
seeing
her
companion
saluting
some
one
turned
and
the
next
moment
the
two
women
whose
features
seemed
so
like
yet
so
unlike
were
face
to
face
the
young
man
saw
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
stop
short
for
an
instant
she
stood
as
though
dazed
by
an
unexpected
blow
then
holding
out
her
hands
with
a
gesture
she
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
stepped
to
her
side
permit
me
madam
you
are
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
but
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
woman
by
the
automobile
allowed
him
to
support
her
seemingly
unconscious
of
his
presence
and
never
before
had
the
young
man
seen
such
anguish
of
spirit
written
in
a
human
countenance
the
one
who
had
saluted
her
advanced
as
though
to
offer
his
services
but
as
he
moved
toward
her
she
shrank
back
with
a
low
no
no
and
such
a
look
of
horror
and
fear
came
into
her
eyes
that
the
man
by
her
side
felt
his
muscles
tense
with
indignation
looking
straight
into
the
heavy
face
of
the
stranger
he
said
curtly
i
think
you
had
better
go
on
with
a
careless
shrug
the
other
turned
and
went
back
to
the
automobile
where
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
to
his
companions
the
woman
who
had
been
watching
with
a
cold
indifference
stepped
into
the
car
the
man
took
his
seat
by
the
chauffeur
as
the
big
machine
moved
away
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
again
made
as
if
to
stretch
forth
her
hands
in
a
pleading
gesture
the
young
man
spoke
pityingly
may
i
assist
you
to
a
carriage
madam
at
his
words
she
looked
up
at
him
and
seeming
to
find
in
his
face
the
strength
she
needed
answered
in
a
low
voice
thank
you
sir
i
am
better
now
i
will
he
all
right
presently
if
you
will
put
me
on
the
car
she
indicated
a
that
was
just
stopping
at
the
crossing
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
are
strong
enough
he
asked
kindly
as
he
walked
with
her
toward
the
car
yes
with
a
sad
attempt
to
smile
yes
and
i
thank
you
very
much
sir
for
your
gentle
courtesy
he
assisted
her
up
the
step
of
the
car
and
stood
with
bared
head
as
she
passed
inside
and
the
conductor
gave
the
signal
the
incident
had
attracted
little
attention
from
the
passengers
who
were
hurrying
from
the
train
their
minds
were
too
intent
upon
other
things
to
more
than
glance
at
this
little
ripple
on
the
surface
of
life
those
who
had
chanced
to
notice
the
woman
agitation
had
seen
also
that
she
was
being
cared
for
and
so
had
passed
on
giving
the
scene
no
second
thought
when
the
man
returned
from
the
street
to
his
grips
on
the
depot
platform
the
hacks
and
hotel
buses
were
gone
as
he
stood
looking
about
questioningly
for
some
one
who
might
direct
him
to
a
hotel
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
strange
individual
who
was
regarding
him
intently
fully
six
feet
in
height
the
observer
was
so
lean
that
he
suggested
the
unpleasant
appearance
of
a
living
skeleton
his
narrow
shoulders
were
so
rounded
his
form
was
so
stooped
that
the
young
man
first
thought
was
to
wonder
how
tall
he
would
really
be
if
he
could
stand
erect
his
long
thin
face
seamed
and
lined
was
striking
in
its
grotesque
ugliness
from
under
his
craggy
scowling
brows
his
sharp
eyes
peered
with
a
curious
expression
of
baffling
quizzing
half
pathetic
and
wholly
cynical
interrogation
he
was
smoking
a
straight
brier
pipe
at
his
feet
lay
a
beautiful
irish
setter
dog
half
hidden
by
a
supporting
column
of
the
depot
portico
as
if
to
escape
the
notice
of
the
people
in
the
automobile
he
had
been
watching
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
with
more
than
casual
interest
he
turned
now
upon
the
young
man
who
had
so
kindly
given
her
assistance
in
answer
to
the
stranger
inquiry
with
a
curt
sentence
and
a
nod
of
his
head
he
directed
him
to
a
hotel
two
blocks
away
thanking
him
the
young
man
carrying
his
grips
set
out
upon
reaching
the
street
he
involuntarily
turned
to
look
back
the
oddly
appearing
character
had
not
moved
from
his
place
but
stood
still
looking
after
the
stranger
the
brier
pipe
in
his
mouth
the
irish
setter
at
his
feet
chapter
iii
the
famous
conrad
lagrange
when
the
young
man
reached
the
hotel
he
went
at
once
to
his
room
where
he
passed
the
time
between
the
hour
of
his
arrival
and
the
evening
meal
upon
his
return
to
the
lobby
the
first
object
that
attracted
his
eyes
was
the
uncouth
figure
of
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
depot
and
who
had
directed
him
to
the
hotel
that
oddly
appearing
individual
his
brier
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
and
the
irish
setter
at
his
feet
was
standing
or
rather
lounging
at
the
counter
bending
over
the
register
an
attitude
which
making
his
form
more
round
shouldered
than
ever
caused
him
to
present
the
general
outlines
of
a
rude
interrogation
point
in
the
a
few
minutes
later
the
two
men
sat
at
adjoining
tables
and
the
young
man
heard
his
neighbor
bullying
the
waiters
and
commenting
in
an
audible
undertone
upon
every
dish
that
was
served
to
him
swearing
by
all
the
heathen
gods
known
and
unknown
that
there
was
nothing
fit
to
eat
in
the
house
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
there
was
no
place
else
in
the
cursed
town
that
served
half
so
good
he
would
not
touch
a
mouthful
in
the
place
then
to
the
other
secret
amusement
he
fell
to
right
heartily
and
made
an
astonishing
meal
of
the
really
excellent
viands
he
had
so
roundly
vilified
dinner
over
the
young
man
went
with
his
cigar
to
the
long
veranda
intent
upon
enjoying
the
restful
quiet
of
the
evening
after
the
tiresome
days
on
the
train
carrying
a
chair
to
an
unoccupied
corner
he
had
his
cigar
just
nicely
under
way
when
the
irish
setter
with
all
the
dignity
of
his
royal
blood
approached
resting
a
head
with
its
long
silky
ears
confidently
upon
the
stranger
knee
the
dog
looked
up
into
the
face
with
an
expression
of
hearty
in
his
soft
eyes
that
was
irresistible
good
dog
said
the
man
heartily
good
old
fellow
and
stroked
the
sleek
head
and
neck
affectionately
a
whiff
of
pipe
smoke
drifted
over
his
shoulder
and
he
looked
around
the
dog
master
stood
just
behind
him
regarding
him
with
that
quizzing
half
pathetic
half
humorous
and
altogether
cynical
expression
the
young
man
who
had
been
so
unresponsive
to
the
advances
of
his
fellow
passengers
for
some
reason
unknown
probably
to
himself
now
took
the
initiative
you
have
a
fine
dog
here
sir
he
said
encouragingly
without
replying
the
other
turned
away
and
in
another
moment
returned
with
a
chair
whereupon
the
dog
with
slightly
waving
feathery
tail
transferred
his
attention
to
his
master
caressing
the
head
with
a
gentle
hand
and
apparently
speaking
to
the
soft
eyes
that
looked
up
at
him
so
understandingly
the
man
said
if
the
human
race
was
fit
to
associate
with
such
dogs
the
world
would
be
a
more
comfortable
place
to
live
in
the
deep
voice
that
rumbled
up
from
some
unguessed
depths
of
that
sunken
chest
was
remarkable
in
its
suggestion
of
a
virile
power
that
the
general
appearance
of
the
man
seemed
to
deny
facing
his
companion
suddenly
he
asked
with
a
direct
bluntness
are
you
not
aaron
king
son
of
the
aaron
king
of
new
england
political
fame
under
the
searching
gaze
of
those
eyes
the
young
man
flushed
yes
my
father
was
active
in
new
england
politics
he
answered
simply
did
you
know
him
very
well
returned
the
other
very
well
he
repeated
the
two
words
with
a
suggestive
emphasis
his
eyes
with
that
curious
baffling
questioning
look
still
fixed
upon
his
companion
face
the
red
in
aaron
king
cheeks
deepened
looking
away
the
strange
man
added
with
a
softer
note
in
his
rough
voice
i
thought
i
knew
you
when
i
saw
you
at
the
depot
your
mother
and
i
were
boy
and
girl
together
there
is
a
little
of
her
face
in
yours
if
you
have
as
much
of
her
character
you
are
to
be
congratulated
and
so
are
the
rest
of
us
the
last
words
were
spoken
apparently
to
the
dog
who
still
looking
up
at
him
seemed
to
express
with
tail
an
understanding
of
thoughts
that
were
only
partly
put
into
words
there
was
an
impersonality
in
the
man
personalities
that
made
it
impossible
for
the
subject
of
his
observations
to
take
offense
aaron
king
when
it
was
evident
that
the
man
had
no
thought
of
introducing
himself
said
with
the
fine
courtesy
that
seemed
always
to
find
expression
in
his
voice
and
manner
may
i
ask
your
name
sir
the
other
without
turning
his
eyes
from
the
dog
answered
conrad
lagrange
the
young
man
smiled
i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
lagrange
surely
you
are
not
the
famous
novelist
of
that
name
and
not
retorted
the
other
again
turning
his
face
quickly
toward
his
companion
am
i
not
distinguished
enough
in
appearance
do
i
look
like
the
mob
true
i
am
a
scrawny
humpbacked
scarecrow
of
a
man
but
what
matters
if
i
do
not
look
like
the
mob
what
is
called
fame
is
as
scrawny
and
humpbacked
and
as
my
body
but
what
matters
famous
or
infamous
to
not
look
like
the
mob
is
the
thing
it
is
impossible
to
put
in
print
the
peculiar
humor
of
pathetic
regret
of
sarcasm
born
of
contempt
of
intolerant
intellectual
pride
that
marked
the
last
sentence
which
was
addressed
to
the
dog
as
though
the
speaker
turned
from
his
human
companion
to
a
more
worthy
listener
when
aaron
king
could
find
no
words
to
reply
the
novelist
shot
another
question
at
him
with
startling
suddenness
do
you
read
my
books
the
other
began
a
halting
answer
to
the
effect
that
everybody
read
conrad
lagrange
books
but
the
distinguished
author
interrupted
do
take
the
trouble
to
lie
out
of
politeness
i
shall
ask
you
to
tell
me
about
them
and
you
will
be
in
a
hole
the
young
man
laughed
as
he
said
with
frankness
i
have
read
only
one
mr
lagrange
which
one
the
ah
why
the
one
you
know
where
the
husband
of
one
woman
falls
in
love
with
the
wife
of
another
who
is
in
love
with
the
husband
of
some
one
else
pshaw
what
is
the
title
i
mean
the
one
that
created
such
a
furore
you
know
yes
said
the
man
to
his
dog
o
yes
czar
i
am
the
famous
conrad
lagrange
i
observe
he
added
turning
to
the
other
with
twinkling
eyes
i
observe
king
that
you
really
have
a
good
bit
of
your
mother
character
that
you
do
not
read
my
books
is
a
recommendation
that
i
better
than
any
one
know
how
to
appreciate
the
light
of
humor
went
from
his
face
suddenly
as
it
had
come
again
he
turned
away
and
his
deep
voice
was
gentle
as
he
continued
your
mother
is
a
rare
and
beautiful
spirit
sir
knowing
her
regard
for
the
true
and
genuine
her
love
for
the
pure
and
beautiful
i
scarcely
expected
to
find
her
son
interested
in
the
realism
of
fiction
i
congratulate
you
young
man
he
paused
then
added
with
indescribable
bitterness
that
you
have
not
read
my
books
for
a
few
moments
aaron
king
did
not
answer
at
last
with
quiet
dignity
he
said
my
mother
was
a
remarkable
woman
mr
lagrange
the
other
faced
him
quickly
you
say
do
you
mean
my
mother
is
dead
sir
i
was
called
home
from
abroad
by
her
illness
for
a
little
the
older
man
sat
looking
into
the
gathering
dusk
then
deliberately
he
refilled
his
brier
pipe
and
rising
said
to
his
dog
come
czar
it
time
to
go
without
a
word
of
parting
to
his
human
companion
with
the
dog
moving
sedately
by
his
side
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
all
the
next
day
aaron
king
in
the
hotel
the
lobby
and
on
the
veranda
watched
for
the
famous
novelist
even
on
the
streets
of
the
little
city
he
found
himself
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
uncouth
figure
and
the
homely
face
of
the
man
whose
unusual
personality
had
so
attracted
him
the
day
was
nearly
gone
when
conrad
lagrange
again
appeared
as
on
the
evening
before
the
young
man
was
smoking
his
cigar
on
the
veranda
when
the
irish
setter
and
a
whiff
of
pipe
smoke
announced
the
strange
character
presence
without
taking
a
seat
the
novelist
said
i
always
have
a
look
at
the
mountains
at
this
time
of
the
day
king
would
you
care
to
come
these
mountains
are
the
real
thing
you
know
and
well
worth
seeing
particularly
at
this
hour
there
was
a
gentle
softness
in
his
deep
voice
now
as
unlike
his
usual
speech
as
his
physical
appearance
was
unlike
that
of
his
younger
companion
aaron
king
arose
quickly
thank
you
mr
lagrange
i
will
go
with
pleasure
accompanied
by
the
dog
they
followed
the
avenue
under
the
giant
pepper
trees
that
shut
out
the
sky
with
their
gnarled
limbs
and
gracefully
drooping
branches
to
the
edge
of
the
little
city
where
the
view
to
the
north
and
northeast
was
unobstructed
by
houses
just
where
the
street
became
a
road
conrad
lagrange
putting
his
hand
upon
his
arm
said
in
a
low
voice
this
is
the
place
behind
them
beautiful
fairlands
lay
half
lost
in
its
wilderness
of
trees
and
flowers
immediately
in
the
foreground
a
large
tract
of
unimproved
land
brought
the
wild
grasses
and
plants
to
their
very
feet
beyond
these
acres
upon
which
there
were
no
trees
the
orange
groves
were
massed
in
dark
green
blocks
and
squares
with
here
and
there
thin
rows
of
palms
clumps
of
peppers
or
tall
eucalyptus
to
mark
the
roads
and
the
ranch
homes
beyond
this
and
rising
seemingly
out
of
the
groves
the
san
bernardinos
heaved
their
mighty
masses
into
the
sky
it
was
almost
dark
the
city
lamps
were
lighted
the
outlines
of
grove
and
garden
were
fast
being
lost
in
the
deepening
dusk
the
foothills
with
the
lower
spurs
and
ridges
of
the
mountains
were
softly
modeled
in
dark
blue
against
the
deeper
purple
of
the
canyons
and
gorges
upon
the
cloudless
sky
that
was
lighted
with
clearest
saffron
the
lines
of
the
higher
crests
were
sharply
drawn
while
the
lonely
peaks
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
darkening
valley
below
catching
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
glowed
changing
to
salmon
deepening
into
mauve
as
the
light
failed
aaron
king
broke
the
silence
by
drawing
a
long
breath
as
one
who
could
find
no
words
to
express
his
emotions
conrad
lagrange
spoke
sadly
and
to
think
that
there
are
in
this
city
of
ten
thousand
probably
nine
thousand
nine
hundred
and
ninety
people
who
never
see
it
with
a
short
laugh
the
young
man
said
it
makes
my
fingers
fairly
itch
for
my
palette
and
brushes
though
it
not
at
all
my
sort
of
thing
the
other
turned
toward
him
quickly
you
are
an
artist
i
had
just
completed
my
three
years
study
abroad
when
mother
illness
brought
me
home
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
one
on
the
line
and
they
say
over
there
that
i
had
a
good
chance
i
do
know
how
it
will
go
here
at
home
there
was
a
note
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
what
do
you
do
portraits
illustration
a
curious
expression
of
baffling
quizzing
half
pathetic
and
wholly
cynical
interrogation
with
his
face
again
toward
the
mountains
the
novelist
said
thoughtfully
this
west
country
will
produce
some
mighty
artists
king
by
far
the
greater
part
of
this
land
must
remain
always
in
its
primitive
naturalness
it
will
always
be
easier
here
than
in
the
city
crowded
east
for
a
man
to
be
himself
there
is
less
of
that
spirit
which
is
born
of
clubs
and
cliques
and
clans
and
schools
with
their
theorizing
and
their
impudent
assumption
that
they
are
divinely
commissioned
to
sit
in
judgment
there
is
less
of
artistic
esthetic
posing
and
soulful
talk
and
more
opportunity
for
that
loneliness
out
of
which
great
art
comes
the
atmosphere
of
these
mountains
and
deserts
and
seas
inspires
to
a
rather
than
to
a
clinging
fast
to
the
traditions
and
culture
of
others
and
what
after
all
a
great
artist
but
one
who
greatly
asserts
himself
the
younger
man
answered
in
a
like
vein
lagrange
your
words
recall
to
my
mind
a
thought
in
one
of
mother
favorite
books
she
quoted
from
the
volume
so
often
that
as
a
youngster
i
almost
knew
it
by
heart
and
in
turn
it
became
my
favorite
indeed
i
think
that
with
mother
aid
as
an
interpreter
it
has
had
more
influence
upon
my
life
than
any
other
one
book
this
is
the
thought
understand
the
message
of
the
mountains
to
love
them
for
what
they
are
and
in
terms
of
life
to
give
expression
to
that
understanding
and
love
is
a
mark
of
true
greatness
of
soul
i
do
not
know
the
author
the
book
is
anonymous
i
am
the
author
of
that
book
sir
the
strange
man
answered
with
simple
dignity
or
rather
i
should
say
i
the
author

added
with
a
burst
of
his
bitter
sarcastic
humor
for
god
sake
do
betray

his

shaken
with
feeling
his
worn
and
rugged
features
twitched
and

with
emotion
aaron
king
listened
in
amazement
to
the
words
that
were
spoken
by
the
famous
novelist
with
such
pathetic
regret
and
stinging
not
knowing
how
to
reply
he
said
casually
you
are
working
here
mr
lagrange
working
me
i
do
anywhere
i
am
a
literary
scavenger
i
haunt
the
intellectual
slaughter
pens
and
live
by
the
putrid
offal
that
writers
reject
i
glean
the
stinking
materials
for
my
stories
from
the
sewers
and
cesspools
of
life
for
the
dollars
they
pay
i
furnish
my
readers
with
those
thrills
that
public
decency
forbids
them
to
experience
at
first
hand
i
am
a
procurer
for
the
purposes
of
mental
prostitution
my
books
breed
moral
pestilence
and
spiritual
disease
the
unholy
filth
i
write
fouls
the
minds
and
pollutes
the
imaginations
of
my
readers
i
am
an
instigator
of
degrading
immorality
and
unmentionable
crimes
no
young
man
i
do
work
just
now
i
doing
penance
in
this
damned
town
my
rotten
imaginings
have
proven
too
much
even
for
me
and
the
doctors
sent
me
west
to
recuperate
the
artist
could
find
no
words
that
would
answer
in
silence
the
two
men
turned
away
from
the
mountains
and
started
back
along
the
avenue
by
which
they
had
come
when
they
had
walked
some
little
distance
the
young
man
said
this
is
your
first
visit
to
fairlands
mr
lagrange
i
was
here
last
year
answered
the
other
here
and
in
the
hills
yonder
have
been
much
in
the
mountains
not
in
california
this
is
my
first
trip
to
the
west
i
have
seen
something
of
the
mountains
though
at
tourist
resorts
abroad
which
means
commented
the
other
that
you
have
never
seen
them
at
all
aaron
king
laughed
i
dare
say
you
are
right
and
you
asked
the
novelist
abruptly
eyeing
his
companion
what
brought
you
to
this
community
that
thinks
so
much
more
of
its
millionaires
than
it
does
of
its
mountains
have
come
to
fairlands
to
work
i
hope
to
answered
the
artist
there
are
there
are
reasons
why
i
do
not
care
to
work
for
the
present
in
the
east
i
confess
it
was
because
i
understood
that
fairlands
offered
exceptional
opportunities
for
a
portrait
painter
that
i
came
here
to
succeed
in
my
work
you
know
one
must
come
in
touch
with
people
of
influence
it
is
sometimes
easier
to
interest
them
when
they
are
away
from
their
homes
in
some
place
like
this
where
their
social
duties
and
business
cares
are
not
so
pressing
there
is
no
question
of
the
material
that
fairlands
has
to
offer
king
returned
the
novelist
in
his
grim
sarcastic
humor
god
how
i
envy
you
he
added
with
a
flash
of
earnest
passion
you
are
young
you
are
beginning
your
life
work
you
are
looking
forward
to
success
you
i
succeed
the
painter
interrupted
impetuously
i
must
succeed
in
what
do
you
mean
by
success
surely
should
understand
what
i
mean
by
success
the
younger
man
retorted
you
who
have
gained
oh
yes
i
forgot
came
the
quick
interruption
i
am
the
conrad
lagrange
of
course
you
too
must
succeed
you
must
become
the
aaron
king
but
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
why
you
must
as
you
call
it
succeed
the
artist
hesitated
before
answering
then
said
with
anxious
earnestness
i
do
think
i
can
explain
lagrange
my
mother
he
paused
the
older
man
stopped
short
and
turning
stood
for
a
little
with
his
face
towards
the
mountains
where
san
bernardino
peak
was
thrust
among
the
stars
when
he
spoke
every
bit
of
that
bitter
humor
was
gone
from
his
deep
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
king
he
said
slowly
i
am
as
ugly
and
misshapen
in
spirit
as
in
body
but
when
they
had
walked
some
way
again
in
silence
and
were
drawing
near
the
hotel
the
momentary
change
in
his
mood
passed
in
a
tone
of
stinging
sarcasm
he
said
you
are
on
the
right
road
king
you
did
well
to
come
to
fairlands
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
have
mastered
the
modern
technic
of
your
art
to
acquire
fame
you
have
only
to
paint
pictures
of
fast
women
who
have
no
morals
at
all
making
them
appear
as
innocent
maidens
because
they
have
the
price
to
pay
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
of
social
importance
put
upon
your
canvases
what
the
world
will
call
portraits
of
distinguished
citizens
making
money
thugs
to
look
like
noble
patriots
and
bloody
butchers
of
humanity
like
benevolent
saints
you
need
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
about
your
success
it
is
easy
get
in
with
the
right
people
use
your
family
name
and
your
distinguished
ancestors
pull
a
few
judicious
advertising
wires
do
a
few
artistic
stunts
get
yourself
into
the
papers
long
and
often
no
matter
how
make
yourself
a
fad
become
a
pet
of
the
social
autocrats
and
your
fame
is
assured
and
you
will
be
what
i
am
the
young
man
quietly
ignoring
the
humor
of
the
novelist
words
said
protestingly
but
surely
to
portray
human
nature
is
legitimate
art
lagrange
your
great
artists
that
the
west
is
to
produce
will
not
necessarily
be
landscape
painters
or
write
essays
upon
nature
will
they
to
portray
human
nature
is
legitimate
work
for
an
artist
yes
agreed
the
novelist
but
he
must
portray
human
nature
the
forces
that
human
nature
are
the
forces
that
must
be
felt
in
the
picture
and
in
the
story
that
these
determining
forces
are
so
seldom
seen
by
the
eyes
of
the
world
is
the
reason
pictures
and
stories
the
artist
who
fails
to
realize
for
his
world
the
elements
in
the
life
which
he
essays
to
paint
or
write
fails
to
just
that
degree
in
being
an
artist
or
is
by
his
work
as
criminally
careless
a
charlatan
or
a
liar
that
one
who
for
a
price
presents
a
picture
or
a
story
without
regard
for
the
influence
of
his
production
upon
the
characters
of
those
who
receive
it
commits
a
crime
for
which
human
law
provides
no
adequate
punishment
being
the
famous
conrad
lagrange
you
understand
i
have
the
right
to
say
this
you
will
probably
believe
it
some
day
if
you
do
not
now
that
is
you
will
believe
it
if
you
have
the
soul
and
the
intelligence
of
an
artist
if
you
have
not
it
will
not
matter
and
you
will
be
happy
in
your
success
as
the
novelist
finished
speaking
the
two
men
arrived
at
the
hotel
steps
where
they
halted
with
that
indecision
of
chance
acquaintances
who
have
no
plans
beyond
the
passing
moment
yet
who
in
mutual
interest
would
extend
the
time
of
their
brief
companionship
while
they
stood
there
each
hesitating
to
make
the
advance
a
big
touring
car
rolled
up
the
driveway
and
stopped
under
the
full
light
of
the
veranda
aaron
king
recognized
the
lady
of
the
observation
car
platform
with
her
two
traveling
companions
and
the
man
who
had
met
them
at
the
depot
as
the
party
greeted
the
novelist
and
he
returned
their
salutation
the
artist
turned
away
to
find
again
the
chair
where
an
hour
before
the
strange
character
who
was
to
play
so
large
a
part
in
his
life
and
work
had
found
him
the
dog
czar
as
if
preferring
the
companionship
of
the
artist
to
the
company
of
those
who
were
engaging
his
master
attention
followed
the
young
man
from
where
he
sat
the
painter
could
see
the
tall
uncouth
figure
of
the
famous
novelist
standing
beside
the
automobile
while
the
occupants
of
the
car
were
apparently
absorbingly
interested
in
what
he
was
saying
the
beautiful
face
of
the
woman
was
brightly
animated
as
she
evidently
took
the
lead
in
the
conversation
the
artist
could
see
her
laughing
and
shaking
her
head
once
he
even
heard
her
speak
the
writer
name
whereupon
every
lounger
upon
the
veranda
within
hearing
turned
to
observe
the
party
with
curious
interest
several
times
the
young
man
noted
that
she
glanced
in
his
direction
half
inquiringly
with
a
suggestion
of
being
pleased
as
though
she
were
glad
to
have
seen
him
in
company
with
her
celebrated
friend
then
the
man
who
held
so
large
a
place
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
drew
back
lifting
his
hat
the
automobile
started
forward
the
party
called
good
night
the
woman
voice
rose
clear
so
that
the
spectators
might
easily
understand
remember
lagrange
i
shall
expect
you
thursday
day
after
as
conrad
lagrange
came
up
the
hotel
steps
the
eyes
of
all
were
upon
him
but
he
apparently
unconscious
of
the
company
went
straight
to
the
artist
where
without
a
word
he
dropped
into
the
vacant
chair
by
the
young
man
side
and
began
thoughtfully
refilling
his
brier
pipe
flipping
the
match
over
the
veranda
railing
and
expelling
a
prodigious
cloud
of
smoke
the
novelist
said
grimly
and
there
my
fellow
artist
go
your
masters
i
trust
you
observed
them
with
proper
reverence
i
would
have
introduced
you
but
i
do
not
like
to
take
the
initiative
in
such
outrages
that
will
come
soon
enough
the
young
should
be
permitted
to
enjoy
their
freedom
while
they
may
aaron
king
laughed
thank
you
for
your
consideration
he
returned
but
i
do
not
think
i
am
in
any
immediate
danger
which
the
other
retorted
dryly
betrays
either
innocence
caution
or
an
unusual
understanding
of
life
i
am
not
now
prepared
to
say
whether
you
know
too
much
or
too
little
i
confess
to
a
degree
of
curiosity
said
the
artist
i
traveled
in
the
same
pullman
with
three
of
the
party
may
i
ask
the
names
of
your
friends
the
other
answered
in
his
bitterest
vein
i
have
no
friends
king
i
have
only
admirers
as
for
their
names
he
continued
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
withhold
either
who
they
are
or
what
they
are
besides
i
observed
that
the
reigning
in
the
realm
of
art
has
her
eye
upon
you
already
as
i
shall
very
soon
be
commanded
to
drag
you
to
her
it
is
well
for
you
to
be
prepared
the
young
man
laughed
as
the
other
paused
to
puff
vigorously
at
his
brier
pipe
that
brute
is
james
rutlidge
the
son
and
heir
of
old
jim
rutlidge
continued
the
novelist
jim
inherited
a
few
odd
millions
from
father
and
killed
himself
spending
them
in
unmentionable
ways
the
son
is
most
worthily
carrying
out
his
mission
with
bright
prospects
of
exceeding
his
distinguished
fondest
dreams
but
unfortunately
is
hampered
by
lack
of
adequate
capital
the
bulk
of
the
family
wealth
having
gone
with
the
old
man
do
you
mean
james
rutlidge
the
great
critic
exclaimed
aaron
king
with
increased
interest
the
same
answered
the
other
with
his
twisted
smile
i
thought
you
would
recognize
his
name
as
an
artist
you
will
undoubtedly
have
much
to
do
with
him
his
friendship
is
one
of
the
things
that
are
vital
to
your
success
believe
me
his
power
in
modern
art
is
a
power
that
you
will
do
well
to
recognize
of
his
companions
he
went
on
the
horrible
example
is
edward
taine
friend
and
fellow
martyr
of
james
rutlidge
senior
satan
perhaps
can
explain
how
he
has
managed
to
outlive
his
partner
his
home
is
in
new
york
but
he
has
a
big
house
on
fairlands
heights
with
large
orange
groves
in
this
district
he
comes
here
winters
for
his
health
he
die
before
long
the
effervescing
young
creature
is
his
daughter
louise
by
his
first
wife
the
who
is
not
much
older
than
his
daughter
is
the
present
mrs
taine
his
wife
the
artist
exclamation
drew
a
sarcastic
chuckle
from
the
other
i
am
prepared
now
to
testify
to
your
unworldly
innocence
of
heart
and
mind
he
gibed
and
pray
why
not
his
wife
you
see
she
was
the
ward
of
old
rutlidge
a
niece
it
is
said
rutlidge
as
you
have
no
doubt
heard
killed
herself
it
was
shortly
after
her
death
that
jim
took
this
little
one
into
his
home
she
and
young
jim
grew
up
together
what
was
more
natural
or
fitting
than
that
her
guardian
when
he
was
about
to
depart
from
this
sad
world
where
human
flesh
is
not
able
to
endure
an
unlimited
amount
of
dissipation
should
give
the
girl
as
a
lively
souvenir
to
his
bosom
friend
and
companion
of
his
unmentionable
deviltries
the
transaction
also
enabled
him
you
understand
to
draw
upon
the
taine
millions
and
so
permitted
him
to
finish
his
distinguished
career
with
credit
you
with
your
artist
extravagant
fancy
have
no
doubt
been
thinking
of
her
as
fashioned
for
i
assure
you
knows
better
the
world
in
which
she
has
been
schooled
has
left
her
no
hazy
ideas
as
to
what
she
was
made
for
i
have
heard
of
the
taines
said
the
younger
man
thoughtfully
i
suppose
this
is
the
same
family
they
are
very
prominent
in
the
social
world
and
quite
generous
patrons
of
the
arts
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
said
the
novelist
they
are
the
noblest
of
our
nobility
they
dwell
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
millions
by
the
dollarless
multitudes
they
are
envied
they
assume
to
be
the
cultured
of
the
cultured
patrons
of
the
arts
why
man
have
autographed
copies
of
all
my
books
they
and
their
kind
me
and
my
kind
they
will
feed
you
sir
or
by
god
you
starve
but
you
need
have
no
fear
that
the
crust
of
genius
will
be
your
portion
he
added
meaningly
as
i
remarked
the
has
her
eye
upon
you
and
why
do
you
so
distinguish
the
lady
asked
the
artist
quietly
amused
with
just
a
hint
of
condescension
has
taine
such
powerful
influence
in
the
world
of
art
if
conrad
lagrange
noticed
his
companion
manner
he
passed
it
by
i
perceive
he
said
that
you
are
still
somewhat
lacking
in
the
rudiments
of
your
profession
the
statement
of
faith
adhered
to
by
modern
climbers
on
the
ladder
of
fame
such
as
i
have
been
and
you
aspire
to
be
is
that
wins
our
creed
is
by
we
stand
by
we
fall
it
pleases
taine
to
be
in
the
world
of
art
a
lobbyist
she
knows
the
insides
of
the
inside
rings
and
cliques
and
committees
that
say
what
is
and
what
is
not
art
that
declare
who
shall
be
and
who
shall
not
be
artists
she
has
power
with
those
who
in
their
might
grant
position
and
place
in
the
halls
of
fame
as
their
kinsmen
in
the
political
world
pass
the
plums
to
those
who
court
their
favor
the
great
critics
who
thunder
anathemas
at
the
poor
devils
who
are
outside
eat
out
of
her
hand
jim
rutlidge
and
his
unholy
crew
are
at
her
beck
and
call
jim
you
see
needing
all
he
can
get
of
the
taine
millions
hopes
to
marry
louise
you
can
scarcely
blame
the
young
and
beautiful
taine
for
not
being
interested
in
her
husband
who
is
going
to
die
so
soon
the
poor
girl
must
have
some
amusement
so
she
interests
herself
in
art
you
know
she
gives
more

any

in
the
business
she
deals
in
lions
it
her
fad
to
collect
them
same
as
others
collect
butterflies
or
postage
stamps
she
has
one
other
fad
that
is
less
harmful
and
just
as
deceptive
a
carefully
nourished
reputation
for
prudery
i
sometimes
think
the
gods
must
laugh
or
choke
that
woman
would
no
more
speak
to
you
without
a
proper
introduction
than
she
would
appear
on
the
street
without
shoes
or
stockings
she
has
never
been
seen
in
an
evening
gown
her
beautiful
shoulders
have
never
been
immodestly
bared
to
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
artist
thought
of
that
moment
on
the
observation
car
platform
presently
the
novelist
refilling
his
pipe
said
whimsically
some
day
king
i
shall
write
a
true
story
it
shall
be
a
novel
of
with
characters
drawn
from
life
and
these
characters
in
my
story
shall
bear
the
names
of
the
forces
that
have
made
them
what
they
are
and
which
they
in
turn
have
come
to
represent
i
mean
those
forces
that
are
so
coloring
and
shaping
the
life
and
thought
of
this
age
that
ought
to
be
interesting
said
the
other
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
probably
you
do
you
have
not
been
thinking
much
of
these
things
you
have
your
eye
upon
fame
and
that
old
witch
lives
in
another
direction
to
illustrate
our
friend
and
illustrious
critic
james
rutlidge
in
my
story
will
be
named
his
distinguished
father
was
one
the
horrible
example
edward
taine
boon
companion
of
is
good
laughed
the
artist
i
see
go
on
who
is
the
daughter
of
promptly
returned
the
novelist
with
a
grin
who
else
could
she
be
and
mrs
taine
urged
the
other
the
novelist
responded
quickly
why
the
reigning
in
the
realm
of
art
is
age
of
course
do
you
see
age
given
over
to
for
base
purposes
by
his
companion
and
you
he
paused
go
on
cried
the
young
man
who
or
what
am
i
in
your
story
you
sir
answered
conrad
lagrange
seriously
in
my
story
of
modern
life
represent
art
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
age
will
add
you
to
her
collection
or
whether
some
other
influence
will
intervene
and
you
persisted
the
artist
surely
you
are
in
the
story
i
am
very
much
in
the
story
the
other
answered
my
name
is
my
story
will
be
published
when
i
am
dead
i
have
a
reputation
to
sustain
you
know
aaron
king
was
not
laughing
now
something
that
lay
deep
hidden
beneath
the
rude
exterior
of
the
man
made
itself
felt
in
his
deep
voice
some
powerful
force
underlying
his
whimsical
words
gripped
the
mind
compelling
him
to
search
for
hidden
meanings
in
the
fanciful
suggestions
a
few
moments
passed
in
silence
before
the
young
man
said
slowly
i
met
a
character
yesterday
lagrange
that
might
be
added
to
your
cast
there
are
several
that
will
be
added
to
my
cast
the
other
answered
dryly
to
which
the
painter
returned
did
you
notice
that
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
at
the
depot
conrad
lagrange
looked
at
his
companion
quickly
yes
do
you
know
her
questioned
the
artist
no
why
do
you
ask
only
because
she
interested
me
and
because
she
seemed
to
know
your
friends
rutlidge
and
mrs
taine
the
novelist
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
by
tapping
it
on
the
veranda
railing
the
action
seemed
to
express
a
peculiar
mental
effort
as
though
he
were
striving
to
recall
something
that
had
gone
from
his
memory
i
saw
what
happened
at
the
depot
of
course
he
said
slowly
i
have
seen
the
woman
before
she
lives
here
in
fairlands
her
name
is
miss
willard
no
one
seems
to
know
much
about
her
i
ca
get
over
the
impression
that
i
ought
to
know
her
that
i
have
met
and
known
her
somewhere
years
ago
her
manner
yesterday
at
seeing
taine
was
certainly
very
strange
as
if
to
free
his
mind
from
the
unsuccessful
effort
to
remember
he
rose
to
his
feet
but
why
should
she
be
added
to
the
characters
in
my
novel
king
what
does
she
represent
her
name
said
the
artist
in
your
study
of
life
is
suggested
by
her
face
so
beautiful
on
the
one
side
so
distorted
on
the
other
her
name
should
be
there
really
is
hope
for
you
returned
the
older
man
with
his
quizzing
smile
good
night
come
czar
he
passed
into
the
hotel
the
dog
at
his
heels
it
was
two
days
later
thursday
that
conrad
lagrange
made
his
memorable
visit
to
the
taines
memorable
in
my
story
because
at
that
time
taine
gave
such
unmistakable
evidence
of
her
interest
in
aaron
king
and
his
future
chapter
iv
at
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
as
my
friend
the
social
scientist
would
say
it
is
a
phenomenon
peculiar
to
urban
life
that
the
social
strata
are
more
or
less
clearly
defined
geographically
that
is
in
the
english
of
everyday
people
of
different
classes
live
in
different
parts
of
the
city
as
certain
streets
and
blocks
are
given
to
the
wholesale
establishments
others
to
retail
stores
and
still
others
to
the
manufacturing
plants
so
there
are
the
tenement
districts
the
slums
and
the
streets
where
may
be
found
the
homes
of
wealth
and
fashion
in
fairlands
the
social
rating
is
largely
marked
by
altitude
the
city
lying
in
the
lap
of
the
hills
and
looking
a
little
down
upon
the
valley
plebeian
business
together
with
those
who
do
the
work
of
fairlands
occupies
the
lowest
levels
in
the
corporate
limits
the
heights
are
held
by
fairlands
pride
between
these
two
extremes
the
fairlanders
are
graded
fairly
by
the
levels
they
occupy
it
is
most
gratifying
to
observe
how
generally
the
citizens
of
this
fortunate
community
aspire
to
higher
things
and
to
note
that
the
peculiarly
proud
spirit
of
this
people
is
undoubtedly
explained
by
this
happy
arrangement
which
enables
every
one
to
look
down
upon
his
neighbor
the
view
from
the
winter
home
of
the
taines
was
magnificent
from
the
window
of
the
room
where
taine
sat
that
afternoon
one
could
have
looked
down
upon
all
fairlands
one
might
indeed
have
done
better
than
that
looking
over
the
wealth
of
foliage
that
save
for
the
tower
of
the
building
the
white
municipal
flagstaff
and
the
steeples
and
belfries
of
the
churches
hid
the
city
one
might
have
looked
up
at
the
mountains
high
high
above
the
low
levels
occupied
by
the
fairlanders
the
mountains
lift
their
heads
in
solemn
dignity
looking
down
upon
the
loftiest
fairlander
of
them
all
looking
down
upon
even
the
taines
themselves
but
the
glory
of
taine
god
was
not
declared
by
the
mountains
she
sat
by
the
window
indeed
but
her
eyes
were
upon
the
open
pages
of
a
book
a
popular
novel
that
by
some
strange
legal
lapse
of
the
governmental
conscience
was
and
is
still
permitted
in
print
the
author
of
the
story
that
so
engrossed
taine
was
in
her
opinion
almost
as
great
in
literature
as
conrad
lagrange
himself
by
those
in
authority
who
pronounce
upon
the
worthiness
or
the
unworthiness
of
writer
folk
he
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
writers
of
his
generation
he
is
a
realist
a
modern
of
the
moderns
his
pen
has
never
been
debased
by
an
inartistic
and
antiquated
idealism
his
claim
to
genius
rests
securely
upon
the
fact
that
he
has
no
ideals
he
writes
for
that
select
circle
of
leaders
who
like
the
taines
and
the
rutlidges
are
capable
of
appreciating
his
art
all
of
which
means
that
he
tells
filthy
stories
in
good
english
that
his
stories
are
identical
in
material
and
motive
with
the
vile
yarns
that
are
permitted
only
in
the
lowest
class
barber
shops
and
in
disreputable
in
no
way
detracts
from
the
admiring
praise
of
his
critics
the
generosity
of
his
publishers
or
the
appreciation
of
those
for
whom
he
writes
with
tottering
step
and
feeble
shaking
limbs
edward
taine
entered
the
apartment
as
he
stood
silently
looking
at
his
young
wife
his
glazed
eyes
fed
upon
her
voluptuous
beauty
with
a
look
of
sullen
impotent
lustfulness
that
was
near
insanity
a
spasm
of
coughing
seized
him
he
gasped
and
choked
his
wasted
body
shaken
and
racked
his
dissipated
face
hideously
distorted
by
the
violence
of
the
paroxysm
wrecked
by
the
flesh
he
had
lived
to
gratify
he
was
now
the
mocked
and
tortured
slave
of
the
very
devils
of
unholy
passion
that
he
had
so
often
invoked
to
serve
him
repulsive
as
he
was
he
was
an
object
to
awaken
the
deepest
pity
taine
looking
up
from
her
novel
watched
him
curiously
without
moving
or
changing
her
attitude
of
luxurious
repose
without
speaking
almost
one
would
have
said
a
shade
of
a
smile
was
upon
her
too
perfect
features
when
the
man
who
had
dropped
weak
and
exhausted
into
a
chair
could
speak
he
glared
at
her
in
a
pitiful
rage
and
in
his
throaty
whisper
said
with
a
curse
you
seem
to
be
amused
still
she
did
not
speak
a
tantalizing
smile
broke
over
her
face
and
she
stretched
her
beautiful
body
lazily
in
her
chair
as
a
animal
stirs
in
sleek
physical
contentment
again
with
curses
he
said
i
glad
you
so
enjoy
my
company
to
be
laughed
at
even
is
better
than
your
damned
indifference
you
misjudge
me
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
low
and
soft
was
still
richly
colored
by
the
wealth
of
vitality
that
found
expression
in
her
splendid
body
i
am
not
at
all
indifferent
to
your
condition
quite
the
contrary
i
am
intensely
interested
as
for
the
amusement
you
afford
me
please
consider
for
three
years
i
have
amused
you
can
you
deny
me
my
turn
he
laughed
with
a
hideously
mirthless
chuckle
as
he
returned
with
ghastly
humor
i
have
had
the
worth
of
my
money
i
advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
your
opportunity
i
shall
make
things
as
pleasant
for
you
as
i
can
while
i
am
with
you
but
as
you
know
i
am
liable
to
leave
you
at
any
time
now
pray
do
hurry
away
she
replied
sweetly
i
shall
miss
you
so
when
you
are
gone
he
glared
at
her
while
she
laughed
mockingly
where
is
everybody
he
asked
the
place
is
as
lonely
as
a
tomb
louise
is
out
riding
with
jim
and
what
are
you
doing
at
home
he
demanded
suspiciously
me
oh
i
remained
to
care
for
you
to
keep
you
from
being
lonely
you
lie
you
are
expecting
some
one
she
laughed
who
is
it
this
time
he
persisted
your
insinuations
are
so
unwarranted
she
murmured
whom
are
you
expecting
dear
me
how
persistently
you
look
for
evil
she
mocked
you
know
perfectly
well
that
thanks
to
my
tact
i
am
considered
quite
the
model
wife
you
really
should
cultivate
a
more
trusting
disposition
another
fit
of
coughing
seized
him
and
while
he
suffered
she
again
watched
him
with
that
curious
air
of
interest
when
he
could
command
his
voice
he
gasped
in
a
choking
whisper
you
fiend
i
know
and
you
know
that
i
know
am
i
so
innocent
that
jack
hanover
and
charlie
rodgers
and
black
whitman
and
as
many
more
of
their
kind
can
make
love
to
you
under
my
very
nose
without
my
knowing
it
you
take
damned
good
care
posing
as
a
prude
with
your
fad
about
immodest
dress
that
the
world
sees
nothing
but
you
have
never
troubled
to
hide
it
from
me
deliberately
she
arose
and
stood
before
him
and
why
should
i
trouble
to
hide
anything
from
you
she
demanded
look
at
me
she
posed
as
if
to
exhibit
for
his
critical
inspection
the
charm
of
her
physical
beauty
look
at
me
am
i
to
waste
all
upon
you
you
tell
me
that
you
have
had
your
money
worth
surely
the
purchase
price
is
mine
to
spend
as
i
will
even
suppose
that
i
were
as
evil
as
your
foul
mind
sees
me
what
right
have
you
to
object
are
you
so
chaste
that
you
dare
cast
a
stone
at
me
am
i
to
have
no
pleasure
in
this
hell
you
have
made
for
me
but
the
horrible
pleasure
of
watching
you
in
the
hell
you
have
made
for
yourself
be
satisfied
that
the
world
does
not
see
your
shame
though
it
from
no
consideration
of
you
but
wholly
for
myself
that
i
am
careful
as
for
my
modesty
you
know
it
is
not
a
fad
but
a
necessity
that
is
just
it
he
retorted
it
is
the
way
you
make
a
fad
of
a
necessity
forced
to
hide
your
shoulders
you
make
a
virtue
of
concealment
you
make
capital
of
the
very
thing
of
which
you
are
ashamed
and
is
not
that
exactly
what
we
all
do
she
asked
with
brutal
cynicism
do
you
not
fear
the
eyes
of
the
world
as
much
as
i
be
satisfied
that
i
play
the
game
of
respectability
with
you
that
i
give
the
world
no
cause
for
talk
you
may
as
well
be
she
finished
with
devilish
frankness
for
you
are
past
helping
yourself
in
the
matter
as
she
finished
a
servant
appeared
to
announce
conrad
lagrange
and
the
tall
uncouth
figure
of
the
novelist
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
his
sharp
eyes
regarding
them
with
that
peculiar
quizzing
baffling
look
edward
taine
laughed
with
that
horrid
chuckle
lagrange
glad
to
see
you
taine
went
forward
to
greet
the
caller
saying
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
you
arrived
just
in
time
lagrange
edward
and
i
were
discussing
your
latest
book
we
think
it
a
masterpiece
of
realistic
fiction
i
sure
it
will
add
immensely
to
your
fame
i
hear
it
talked
of
everywhere
as
the
most
popular
novel
of
the
year
you
wonderful
man
how
do
you
do
it
i
do
do
it
answered
conrad
lagrange
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
it
does
itself
my
books
are
really
true
products
of
the
age
that
reads
them
and
to
paraphrase
a
statesman
who
was
himself
a
product
of
his
age
for
those
who
read
my
books
they
are
just
the
kind
of
books
that
i
would
expect
such
people
to
read
taine
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
expression
as
though
she
glimpsed
a
hint
of
a
meaning
that
did
not
appear
upon
the
surface
of
his
words
you
do
say
such
such
twisty
things
she
murmured
i
do
think
i
always
understand
what
you
mean
but
when
you
look
at
me
that
way
i
feel
as
though
my
maid
had
neglected
to
finish
hooking
me
up
the
novelist
bowed
in
mock
gallantry
a
movement
which
made
his
ungainly
form
appear
more
grotesque
than
ever
indeed
madam
to
my
humble
eyes
you
are
most
beautifully
and
fittingly
ah
hooked
up
he
turned
toward
the
invalid
and
how
is
the
fortunate
husband
of
the
charming
taine
fine
lagrange
fine
said
the
man
a
cough
interrupting
his
words
really
i
think
that
gertrude
is
unduly
alarmed
about
my
condition
in
this
glorious
climate
i
feel
like
a
you
looking
quite
like
yourself
returned
the
novelist
there
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
me
but
a
slight
bronchial
trouble
continued
the
other
coughing
again
then
to
his
wife
dearest
wo
you
ring
please
i
sure
it
time
for
my
toddy
perhaps
lagrange
will
join
me
in
a
drink
what
it
be
lagrange
nothing
thanks
at
this
hour
no
but
you
pardon
me
i
sure
doctor
orders
you
know
a
servant
appeared
taine
took
the
glass
and
carried
it
to
her
husband
with
her
own
hand
saying
with
tender
solicitude
do
you
think
dear
that
you
should
lie
down
for
a
while
lagrange
will
remain
for
dinner
you
know
you
must
not
tire
yourself
i
sure
he
will
excuse
you
i
manage
somehow
to
amuse
him
until
jim
and
louise
return
i
believe
i
will
rest
a
little
gertrude
he
turned
to
the
guest
while
there
is
nothing
really
wrong
you
know
lagrange
still
it
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
by
all
means
said
the
novelist
heartily
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
do
i
beg
permit
me
to
detain
you
taine
with
careful
tenderness
accompanied
her
husband
to
the
door
when
he
had
passed
from
the
room
she
faced
the
novelist
with
do
you
think
edward
is
really
very
much
worse
lagrange
i
keep
up
appearances
you
know
but
she
paused
with
a
charming
air
of
perplexed
and
worried
anxiety
your
husband
is
certainly
not
a
well
man
madam
but
you
keep
up
appearances
wonderfully
i
really
do
see
how
you
manage
it
but
i
suppose
that
for
one
of
your
nature
it
is
natural
again
she
received
his
words
with
that
look
of
doubtful
understanding
as
though
sensing
some
meaning
beneath
the
polite
commonplace
surface
then
as
if
to
lead
away
from
the
subject
you
must
really
tell
me
what
you
think
of
our
california
home
i
told
you
in
new
york
you
remember
that
i
should
ask
you
the
first
thing
we
were
so
sorry
to
have
missed
you
last
year
please
be
frank
is
it
beautiful
very
beautiful
he
answered
exquisite
taste
perfect
harmony
with
modern
art
his
quizzing
eyes
twinkled
and
a
caricature
of
a
smile
distorted
his
face
it
fairly
smells
to
heaven
of
the
flesh
pots
she
laughed
merrily
the
odor
should
not
be
unfamiliar
to
you
she
retorted
by
all
accounts
your
royalties
are
making
you
immensely
rich
how
wonderful
it
must
be
to
be
famous
to
know
that
the
whole
world
is
talking
about
you
and
that
reminds
me
who
is
your
distinguished
looking
friend
at
the
hotel
i
was
dying
to
ask
you
the
other
night
but
dare
i
know
he
is
somebody
famous
conrad
lagrange
studying
her
face
answered
reluctantly
no
he
is
not
famous
but
i
fear
he
is
going
to
be
another
twisty
saying
she
retorted
but
i
mean
to
have
an
answer
so
you
may
as
well
speak
plainly
have
you
known
him
long
what
is
his
name
and
what
is
he
a
writer
his
name
is
aaron
king
his
mother
and
i
grew
up
in
the
same
neighborhood
he
is
an
artist
how
romantic
do
you
mean
that
he
belongs
to
that
old
family
of
new
england
kings
he
is
the
last
of
them
his
father
was
aaron
king
a
prominent
lawyer
and
politician
in
his
state
oh
yes
i
remember
was
there
something
whispered
at
the
time
of
his
death
some
scandal
that
was
hushed
up
money
stolen
or
something
what
was
it
i
ca
think
whatever
it
was
taine
the
son
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
do
you
think
we
might
let
the
dead
man
stay
safely
buried
there
was
an
ominous
glint
in
conrad
lagrange
eyes
taine
answered
hurriedly
indeed
yes
lagrange
you
are
right
and
you
shall
bring
king
out
to
see
me
if
he
is
as
nice
as
he
looks
i
promise
you
i
will
be
very
good
to
him
perhaps
i
may
even
help
him
a
little
through
jim
you
know
bring
him
in
touch
with
the
right
people
and
that
sort
of
thing
what
does
he
paint
portraits
the
novelist
tone
was
curt
then
i
am
i
could
do
a
great
deal
for
him
and
i
am
sure
you
would
do
a
great
deal
him
said
conrad
lagrange
bluntly
she
laughed
again
and
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
lagrange
not
sure
whether
it
is
complimentary
or
otherwise
that
depends
upon
what
you
consider
complimentary
retorted
the
other
as
i
told
you
aaron
king
is
an
artist
again
she
favored
him
with
that
look
of
doubtful
understanding
shaking
her
head
with
mock
sadness
and
making
a
long
sigh
another
twister
she
said
woefully
just
when
we
were
getting
along
so
beautifully
too
wo
you
try
again
in
words
of
one
syllable
then
let
him
alone
he
is
exactly
where
i
was
twenty
years
ago
for
god
sake
let
him
alone
play
your
game
with
those
who
are
no
loss
to
the
world
or
with
those
who
like
me
are
already
lost
let
this
man
do
his
work
do
make
him
what
i
am
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
laughed
and
these
are
words
of
one
syllable
you
talk
as
though
i
were
a
dreadful
dragon
seeking
a
genius
to
devour
you
are
said
the
novelist
gruffly
how
nice
i
all
shivery
with
delight
already
you
really
bring
him
now
you
see
you
might
as
well
for
if
you
do
i
manage
some
other
way
when
you
are
not
around
to
protect
him
you
do
want
to
trust
him
to
me
unprotected
do
you
no
and
i
wo
retorted
conrad
lagrange
which
though
taine
did
not
remark
it
was
also
a
twister
but
after
all
perhaps
he
wo
come
she
said
with
mock
anxiety
do
worry
madam
he
just
as
much
a
fool
as
the
rest
of
us
as
the
novelist
spoke
they
heard
the
voices
of
miss
taine
and
her
escort
james
rutlidge
taine
had
only
time
to
shake
a
finger
in
playful
warning
at
her
companion
and
to
whisper
mind
you
bring
your
artist
to
me
or
i
get
him
when
you
not
looking
and
listen
do
tell
jim
about
him
i
must
see
what
he
is
like
first
at
lunch
the
next
day
conrad
lagrange
greeted
the
artist
in
his
bitterest
humor
and
how
is
the
famous
aaron
king
i
trust
that
the
greatest
portrait
painter
of
the
age
is
well
that
the
hotel
people
have
been
properly
attentive
to
the
comfort
of
their
illustrious
guest
the
world
of
art
can
ill
afford
to
have
its
rarest
genius
suffer
from
any
lack
of
the
service
that
is
due
his
greatness
the
young
man
face
flushed
at
his
companion
mocking
tone
but
he
laughed
i
missed
you
at
breakfast
i
was
sleeping
off
the
effect
of
my
intellectual
debauch
it
takes
time
to
recover
from
a
dinner
with
and
age
the
other
returned
the
menu
in
his
hand
what
slop
are
they
offering
to
put
in
our
troughs
for
this
noon
feed
again
aaron
king
laughed
but
as
the
novelist
with
characteristic
comments
and
instructions
to
the
waitress
ordered
his
lunch
the
artist
watched
him
as
though
waiting
with
interest
his
further
remarks
on
the
subject
of
his
evening
with
the
taines
when
the
girl
was
gone
conrad
lagrange
turned
again
to
his
companion
and
from
under
his
scowling
brows
regarded
him
much
as
a
withered
scientist
might
regard
an
interesting
insect
under
his
glass
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
he
said
suggestively
as
though
the
bug
had
succeeded
in
acting
in
some
manner
fully
expected
by
the
scientist
but
wholly
disgusting
to
him
the
artist
colored
again
as
he
returned
curiously
upon
what
upon
the
start
you
have
made
toward
the
goal
you
hope
to
reach
what
do
you
mean
taine
wants
you
you
are
pleased
to
be
facetious
under
the
eyes
of
his
companion
aaron
king
felt
that
his
reply
did
not
at
all
conceal
his
satisfaction
i
am
pleased
to
be
exact
i
repeat
taine
wants
you
i
am
ordered
by
the
reigning
of
art
age
to
bring
you
into
her
you
have
won
favor
in
her
sight
she
finds
you
good
to
look
at
she
hopes
to
find
you
as
good
as
you
look
if
you
do
not
disappoint
her
your
fame
is
assured
nonsense
said
the
artist
somewhat
sharply
nettled
by
the
obvious
meaning
and
by
the
sneering
sarcasm
of
the
novelist
words
and
tone
to
which
the
other
returned
suggestively
it
is
precisely
because
you
can
say
when
you
know
it
is
no
nonsense
at
all
but
the
exact
truth
that
your
chance
for
fame
is
so
good
my
friend
and
did
some
reigning
insure
your
success
and
fame
the
older
man
turned
his
peculiar
penetrating
baffling
eyes
full
upon
his
companion
face
and
in
a
voice
full
of
cynical
sadness
answered
exactly
so
i
paid
court
to
the
powers
that
be
they
gave
me
the
reward
i
sought
and
they
made
me
what
i
am
so
it
came
about
that
conrad
lagrange
in
due
time
introduced
aaron
king
to
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
or
as
the
novelist
put
it
he
civilization
in
obedience
to
the
commands
of
her
royal
highness
the
age
presented
the
artist
at
her
majesty
court
that
the
young
man
might
sue
for
the
royal
favor
it
was
perhaps
a
month
after
the
presentation
ceremony
that
the
painter
made
what
to
him
at
least
was
an
important
announcement
chapter
v
the
mystery
of
the
rose
garden
the
acquaintance
of
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
had
developed
rapidly
into
friendship
the
man
whom
the
world
had
chosen
to
place
upon
one
of
the
highest
pinnacles
of
its
literary
favor
and
who
through
some
queer
twist
in
his
nature
was
so
lonely
and
embittered
by
his
exaltation
seemed
to
find
in
the
younger
man
who
stood
with
the
crowd
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
something
that
marked
him
as
different
from
his
fellows
whether
it
was
the
artist
mother
some
sacredly
hidden
memories
of
lagrange
past
or
perhaps
some
fancied
recognition
of
the
genius
and
its
possibilities
the
strange
man
gave
no
hint
but
he
constantly
sought
the
company
of
aaron
king
with
an
openness
that
made
his
preference
for
the
painter
society
very
evident
if
he
had
said
anything
about
it
at
all
conrad
lagrange
likely
would
have
accounted
for
his
interest
upon
the
ground
that
his
dog
czar
found
the
companionship
agreeable
their
friendship
meanwhile
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
conferred
a
peculiar
distinction
upon
the
young
man
a
distinction
not
at
all
displeasing
to
the
ambitious
artist
and
the
value
of
which
he
probably
overrated
to
aaron
king
aside
from
the
subtle
flattery
of
the
famous
attention
there
was
in
the
personality
of
the
odd
character
a
something
that
appealed
to
him
with
peculiar
strength
perhaps
it
was
that
the
words
so
often
sharp
and
stinging
with
bitter
sarcasm
seemed
always
to
carry
a
hidden
meaning
that
gave
as
it
were
glimpses
of
another
nature
buried
deeply
beneath
a
wreck
of
ruined
dreams
and
disappointing
achievements
or
it
may
have
been
that
under
all
the
cruel
of
the
thoughts
expressed
the
young
man
sensed
an
undertone
of
pathetic
sadness
or
again
perhaps
it
was
those
rare
moments
when
on
some
walk
that
carried
them
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
brought
the
mountains
into
unobstructed
view
the
clouds
of
bitterness
were
lifted
and
the
man
spoke
with
poetic
feeling
of
the
realities
of
life
and
of
the
true
glory
and
mission
of
the
arts
counseling
his
friend
with
an
intelligence
as
true
and
delicate
as
it
was
rare
and
fine
it
was
nearly
two
months
after
conrad
lagrange
had
introduced
the
young
man
at
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
the
hour
was
late
the
painter
returning
from
a
dinner
and
an
evening
at
the
taine
home
found
the
novelist
with
pipe
and
dog
in
a
deserted
corner
of
the
hotel
veranda
dropping
into
the
chair
that
was
placed
as
if
it
awaited
his
coming
the
artist
with
no
word
of
greeting
to
the
man
bent
over
the
brown
head
that
was
thrust
so
insistently
against
his
knee
as
czar
with
gently
waving
tail
made
him
welcome
looking
affectionately
into
the
brown
eyes
while
he
stroked
the
silky
coat
the
young
man
answered
in
the
language
that
all
dogs
understand
while
the
novelist
from
under
his
scowling
brows
regarded
the
two
intently
they
were
disappointed
that
you
were
not
there
said
the
painter
presently
taine
particularly
charged
me
to
say
that
she
will
not
forgive
until
you
do
proper
penance
for
your
sin
i
had
better
company
retorted
the
other
czar
and
i
went
for
a
look
at
the
mountains
i
suppose
you
have
noticed
that
czar
does
not
care
for
the
fairlands
heights
crowd
he
is
very
peculiar
in
his
friendships
for
a
dog
his
instincts
are
remarkable
at
the
sound
of
his
name
czar
transferred
his
attentions
for
a
moment
to
his
master
then
stretched
himself
in
his
accustomed
place
beside
the
novelist
chair
the
artist
laughed
i
did
my
best
to
invent
an
acceptable
excuse
for
you
but
she
said
it
was
no
use
nothing
short
of
your
own
personal
prayers
for
mercy
would
do
humph
you
should
have
reminded
her
that
i
purchased
an
indulgence
some
weeks
ago
again
the
other
laughed
shortly
watching
him
closely
conrad
lagrange
said
in
his
most
sneering
tones
i
trust
young
man
that
you
are
not
failing
to
make
good
use
of
your
opportunities
let
see
dinner
and
the
evening
five
times
afternoon
calls
as
many
with
motor
trips
to
points
of
interest
and
one
theater
party
to
los
angeles
believe
me
it
is
not
often
that
struggling
genius
is
so
rewarded
before
it
has
accomplished
anything
bad
enough
to
merit
such
attention
i
been
idling
most
shamefully
have
i
said
the
artist
idling
rasped
the
other
you
have
been
the
busiest
in
the
land
these
scientific
intensive
cultivation
farmers
of
california
are
not
in
your
class
when
it
comes
to
utilizing
the
sunshine
take
my
advice
and
continue
your
present
activity
without
bothering
yourself
by
any
sentimental
thoughts
of
your
palette
and
brushes
the
mere
vulgar
tools
of
your
craft
are
of
minor
importance
to
one
of
your
genius
and
opportunity
then
in
a
half
embarrassed
manner
aaron
king
made
his
announcement
that
may
all
be
he
said
but
just
the
same
i
am
going
to
work
i
knew
it
returned
the
other
in
mocking
triumph
i
knew
it
the
moment
you
came
up
the
steps
there
i
could
tell
it
by
your
walk
by
the
air
with
which
you
carried
yourself
by
your
manner
your
voice
your
laugh
you
fairly
reek
of
prosperity
and
achievement
you
are
going
to
paint
her
portrait
and
why
not
retorted
the
young
man
rather
sharply
a
trifle
nettled
by
the
other
tone
why
not
indeed
murmured
the
novelist
indeed
yes
by
all
means
it
is
so
exactly
the
right
thing
to
do
that
it
is
startling
you
scale
the
heights
of
fame
with
such
confident
certainty
in
every
move
that
it
is
positively
uncanny
to
watch
you
if
one
work
is
true
i
fail
to
see
why
one
should
not
take
advantage
of
any
influence
that
can
contribute
to
his
success
said
the
painter
i
assure
you
i
am
not
so
wealthy
that
i
can
afford
to
refuse
such
an
attractive
commission
you
must
admit
that
the
beautiful
taine
is
a
subject
worthy
the
brush
of
any
artist
and
i
suppose
it
conceivable
that
i
be
ambitious
to
make
a
genuinely
good
job
of
it
the
older
man
as
though
touched
by
the
evident
sincerity
of
the
words
dropped
his
sneering
tone
and
spoke
earnestly
the
beautiful
taine
a
subject
worthy
a
master
brush
my
friend
but
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
paint
her
portrait
a
master
would
paint
you
will
sign
your
own
death
warrant
so
far
as
your
popularity
and
fame
as
an
artist
goes
i
do
believe
it
declared
aaron
king
flatly
i
know
you
do
if
you
and
still
accepted
the
commission
you
would
be
fit
to
associate
with
honest
dogs
like
czar
here
but
why
persisted
the
artist
why
do
you
insist
that
my
portrait
of
taine
will
be
disastrous
to
my
success
just
to
the
degree
that
it
is
a
work
of
genuine
merit
to
which
the
novelist
answered
cryptically
if
you
have
not
the
eyes
to
see
the
reason
it
will
matter
little
whether
you
know
it
or
not
if
you
see
the
reason
and
still
produce
a
portrait
that
pleases
your
sitter
then
you
will
have
paid
the
price
you
will
receive
your
reward
and
the
speaker
tone
grew
sad
and
bitter
you
will
be
what
i
am
with
this
he
arose
abruptly
and
without
another
word
stalked
into
the
hotel
the
dog
following
with
quiet
dignity
at
his
heels
from
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
almost
the
novelist
and
the
artist
had
dropped
into
the
habit
of
taking
their
meals
together
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
conrad
lagrange
reopened
the
conversation
he
had
so
abruptly
closed
the
night
before
i
suppose
he
said
that
you
will
set
up
a
studio
and
do
the
thing
in
proper
style
taine
told
me
of
a
place
that
is
for
rent
and
that
she
thinks
would
be
just
the
thing
returned
the
young
man
it
is
across
the
road
from
that
big
grove
owned
by
taine
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
care
to
walk
out
that
way
with
me
this
morning
and
help
me
look
it
over
the
older
man
hearty
acceptance
of
the
invitation
assured
the
artist
of
his
genuine
interest
and
an
hour
later
after
aaron
king
had
interviewed
the
agent
and
secured
the
keys
with
the
privilege
of
inspecting
the
premises
the
two
set
out
together
they
found
the
place
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
town
by
the
orange
groves
that
surrounded
it
on
every
side
the
height
of
the
palms
that
grew
along
the
road
in
front
the
pepper
and
eucalyptus
trees
that
overshadowed
the
house
and
the
size
of
the
that
shut
in
the
little
yard
with
walls
of
green
marked
the
place
as
having
been
established
before
the
wealth
of
the
east
discovered
the
peculiar
charm
of
the
fairlands
hills
the
lawn
the
walks
and
the
drive
were
unkempt
and
overgrown
with
weeds
the
house
itself
a
small
cottage
with
a
wide
porch
across
the
front
and
on
the
side
to
the
west
unpainted
for
many
seasons
was
tinted
by
the
brush
of
the
elements
a
soft
and
restful
gray
but
the
artist
and
his
friend
as
they
approached
exclaimed
aloud
at
the
beauty
of
the
scene
for
as
if
rejoicing
in
their
freedom
from
restraint
the
roses
had
claimed
the
dwelling
so
neglected
by
man
as
their
own
up
every
post
of
the
porch
they
had
climbed
over
the
porch
roof
they
spread
their
wealth
of
color
over
the
gables
screening
the
windows
with
graceful
lattice
of
vine
and
branch
and
leaf
and
bloom
up
to
the
ridge
and
over
the
cornice
to
the
roof
of
the
house
itself
even
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
they
had
won
their
way
and
there
as
if
in
an
ecstasy
of
wanton
loveliness
flung
a
spray
of
glorious
perfumed
beauty
high
into
the
air
on
the
front
porch
the
men
turned
to
look
away
over
the
gentle
slope
of
the
orange
groves
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
to
the
towering
peaks
and
high
ridges
of
the
mountains
gleaming
cold
and
white
in
the
winter
of
their
altitude
to
the
northeast
san
bernardino
reared
his
head
in
lonely
majesty
looking
directly
down
upon
the
foothills
and
the
feeble
dwellers
in
the
valley
below
far
beyond
and
surrounded
by
the
higher
ridges
and
peaks
and
canyons
of
the
range
san
gorgonio
sat
enthroned
in
the
skies
the
ruler
of
them
all
from
the
northeast
westward
they
viewed
the
mighty
sweep
of
the
main
range
to
cajon
pass
and
the
san
gabriels
beyond
with
san
antonio
cucamonga
and
their
sister
peaks
lifting
their
heads
above
their
fellows
in
the
immediate
landscape
no
house
or
building
was
to
be
seen
the
mass
of
the
orange
groves
hid
every
work
of
man
building
between
them
and
the
tawny
foothills
save
the
gable
and
chimney
of
a
neighboring
cottage
on
the
west
listen
said
conrad
lagrange
in
a
low
tone
moved
as
always
by
the
grandeur
and
beauty
of
the
scene
listen
do
you
hear
them
calling
do
you
feel
the
mountains
sending
their
message
to
these
poor
insects
who
squirm
and
wriggle
in
this
bit
of
muck
men
call
their
world
god
man
if
only
we
in
our
work
would
heed
the
message
of
the
hills
the
novelist
spoke
with
such
intensity
of
feeling
with
such
bitter
sadness
and
regret
in
his
voice
that
aaron
king
could
not
reply
turning
the
artist
unlocked
the
door
and
they
entered
the
cottage
they
found
the
interior
of
the
house
well
arranged
and
not
in
bad
repair
just
the
thing
for
a
bachelor
housekeeping
was
the
verdict
but
for
a
studio
impossible
and
there
was
a
touch
of
regret
in
his
voice
let
continue
our
exploration
said
the
novelist
hopefully
there
a
barn
out
there
and
they
went
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
drive
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
yard
here
again
they
saw
the
roses
in
full
possession
of
the
place
by
man
deserted
from
foundation
to
roof
the
building
a
small
simple
structure
was
almost
hidden
under
a
mass
of
vines
there
was
one
large
room
below
with
a
loft
above
the
stable
was
in
the
rear
built
evidently
at
a
later
date
than
the
house
the
building
was
in
better
repair
the
walls
so
hidden
without
by
the
roses
were
well
sided
the
floors
were
well
laid
the
big
sliding
main
door
opened
on
the
drive
in
front
between
it
and
the
corner
to
the
west
was
a
small
door
and
in
the
western
end
a
window
looking
curiously
from
this
window
conrad
lagrange
uttered
an
exclamation
and
hurried
abruptly
from
the
building
the
artist
followed
from
the
end
of
the
barn
and
extending
the
full
width
of
the
building
to
the
west
line
of
the
yard
was
a
rose
garden
such
a
garden
as
aaron
king
had
never
seen
on
three
sides
the
little
plot
was
enclosed
by
a
tall
hedge
of
ragged
robins
above
the
hedge
on
the
south
and
west
was
the
wall
of
the
orange
grove
on
the
north
the
pepper
and
eucalyptus
trees
in
the
yard
and
a
view
of
the
distant
mountains
and
on
the
east
the
end
of
the
barn
against
the
southern
wall
and
so
directly
opposite
the
trellised
arch
of
the
entrance
a
small
lattice
bower
with
a
rustic
table
and
seats
within
was
completely
covered
as
was
the
barn
by
the
magically
woven
tapestry
of
the
flowers
in
the
corner
of
the
hedge
farthest
from
the
entrance
they
found
a
narrow
gate
unlike
the
rest
of
the
premises
the
garden
was
in
perfect
order
the
roses
trimmed
and
cared
for
the
walks
neatly
edged
and
clean
with
no
weed
or
sign
of
untidiness
or
neglect
anywhere
the
two
men
had
come
upon
the
spot
so
suddenly
so
unexpectedly
the
contrast
with
the
neglected
grounds
and
buildings
was
so
marked
that
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
the
little
retreat
so
lovely
so
hidden
by
its
own
beauty
from
the
world
so
cared
for
by
careful
hands
seemed
haunted
by
an
invisible
spirit
very
quietly
almost
reverently
they
moved
about
talking
in
low
tones
as
though
half
expecting
they
knew
not
what
some
one
loves
this
place
said
the
novelist
softly
when
they
stood
again
in
the
entrance
and
the
artist
answered
in
the
same
hushed
voice
i
wonder
what
it
means
when
they
were
again
in
the
barn
aaron
king
became
eagerly
enthusiastic
over
the
possibilities
of
the
big
room
some
rightly
toned
burlap
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
he
pointed
out
with
floor
covering
and
rugs
in
harmony
there
rolling
back
the
big
door
as
he
spoke
your
north
light
some
hangings
and
screens
to
hide
the
stairway
to
the
loft
and
the
stable
door
your
entrance
over
here
in
the
corner
nicely
out
of
the
way
and
the
window
looking
into
the
garden
it
great
man
great
and
answered
conrad
lagrange
from
where
he
stood
in
the
big
front
door
the
mountains
do
forget
the
mountains
the
soft
steady
north
light
on
your
canvas
and
a
message
from
the
mountains
to
your
soul
through
the
same
window
should
make
it
a
good
place
to
work
i
suppose
over
here
he
moved
away
from
the
window
and
spoke
in
his
mocking
way
over
here
you
will
have
a
for
the
ladies
of
the
circle
elect
who
will
come
to
and
their
admiration
of
the
newly
discovered
genius
and
to
chatter
their
misunderstandings
of
his
art
of
course
there
will
be
a
page
in
velvet
and
gold
by
all
means
get
hold
of
an
oriental
kid
of
some
kind
oriental
junk
is
quite
the
rage
this
year
you
should
take
advantage
of
every
influence
that
can
contribute
to
your
success
you
know
and
whatever
you
do
do
fail
to
consult
the
about
these
essentials
of
your
craft
many
a
promising
genius
has
been
lost
to
fame
through
inviting
the
wrong
people
to
take
tea
in
his
studio
but
he
finished
whimsically
looking
from
the
window
into
the
garden
but
what
the
devil
do
you
suppose
the
spirit
who
lives
out
there
will
think
about
it
all
the
days
of
the
two
following
weeks
were
busy
days
for
aaron
king
he
leased
the
place
in
the
orange
groves
and
set
men
to
work
making
it
habitable
the
lawn
and
grounds
were
trimmed
and
put
in
order
the
interior
of
the
house
was
renovated
by
painter
and
and
the
barn
under
the
artist
direction
was
transformed
into
an
ideal
studio
there
was
a
trip
to
los
angeles
quite
fortunately
upon
a
day
when
taine
must
go
to
the
city
shopping
for
rugs
and
hangings
and
another
trip
to
purchase
the
tools
of
the
artist
craft
and
at
last
there
was
a
chinese
cook
and
housekeeper
to
find
with
supplies
for
his
kitchen
it
was
at
conrad
lagrange
suggestion
that
from
the
first
every
one
was
given
strict
orders
to
keep
out
of
the
rose
garden
every
day
the
novelist
accompanied
always
by
czar
walked
out
that
way
to
see
how
things
were
progressing
and
often
if
he
had
not
been
too
busy
to
notice
aaron
king
might
have
seen
a
look
of
wistfulness
in
the
keen
baffling
eyes
of
the
famous
man
so
and
sad
and
while
he
did
not
cease
to
mock
and
jeer
and
offer
sarcastic
advice
to
his
younger
friend
the
touch
of
pathos
that
like
a
minor
chord
was
so
often
heard
in
his
most
caustic
and
cruel
speeches
was
more
pronounced
as
for
czar
he
always
returned
to
the
hotel
with
evident
reluctance
and
managed
to
express
in
his
dog
way
the
thoughts
his
distinguished
master
would
not
put
in
words
very
often
too
the
big
touring
car
from
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
stopped
in
front
of
the
cottage
while
the
occupants
inspected
the
premises
and
with
many
exclamations
of
flattering
praise
and
a
few
suggestions
made
manifest
their
interest
in
time
it
was
finished
and
ready
from
the
big
easel
by
the
great
north
window
in
the
studio
to
the
yee
kee
in
the
kitchen
when
the
last
workman
was
gone
with
his
tools
and
the
two
men
after
looking
about
the
place
for
an
hour
were
standing
on
the
front
porch
conrad
lagrange
said
and
the
stage
is
set
the
scene
shifters
are
off
the
audience
is
waiting
ring
up
the
curtain
for
the
next
act
even
czar
has
looked
upon
everything
and
calls
it
good
heh
czar
the
dog
went
to
him
and
for
some
minutes
the
novelist
looked
down
into
the
brown
eyes
of
his
companion
who
seemed
so
to
understand
still
fondling
the
dog
without
looking
at
the
artist
the
older
man
continued
you
will
have
your
things
moved
over
in
the
morning
i
suppose
or
will
we
lunch
together
once
more
aaron
king
laughed
as
a
boy
who
has
prepared
a
surprise
and
has
been
struggling
manfully
to
keep
the
secret
until
the
proper
moment
should
arrive
placing
his
hand
on
the
older
man
shoulder
he
answered
meaningly
i
had
planned
that
would
move
in
the
morning
at
the
other
puzzled
expression
he
laughed
again
we
said
the
novelist
facing
his
friend
quickly
come
here
returned
the
other
i
must
show
you
something
you
seen
he
led
the
way
to
a
room
that
they
had
decided
he
would
not
need
and
the
door
of
which
was
locked
taking
a
key
from
his
pocket
he
handed
it
to
his
friend
what
this
said
the
older
man
looking
foolishly
at
the
key
in
his
hand
it
the
key
to
that
door
returned
the
other
with
a
gleeful
chuckle
then
unlock
it
unlock
it
sure
that
what
i
gave
you
the
key
for
conrad
lagrange
obeyed
through
the
open
door
he
saw
not
the
bare
and
empty
room
he
supposed
was
there
but
a
bedroom
charmingly
furnished
complete
in
every
detail
turning
he
faced
his
companion
silently
inquiringly
with
a
look
that
aaron
king
had
never
before
seen
in
those
strange
baffling
eyes
it
yours
said
the
artist
hastily
if
you
care
to
come
you
have
a
free
hand
here
you
know
for
i
will
be
in
the
studio
much
of
the
time
kee
will
cook
the
things
you
like
you
and
czar
can
come
and
go
as
you
will
there
is
the
arbor
in
the
rose
garden
you
know
and
see
here
he
stepped
to
the
window
i
chose
this
room
for
you
because
it
looks
out
upon
your
mountains
the
strange
man
stood
at
the
window
for
what
seemed
to
the
artist
a
long
time
suddenly
he
turned
to
say
sharply
young
man
why
did
you
do
this
why
stammered
the
other
disconcerted
because
i
want
you
because
i
thought
you
would
like
to
come
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
have
made
a
mistake
but
surely
no
harm
has
been
done
and
you
think
you
could
stand
living
with
me
for
any
length
of
time
the
painter
laughed
with
relief
oh
it
i
did
know
you
had
such
a
tender
conscience
you
scared
me
for
a
minute
i
should
think
you
would
know
by
this
time
that
you
ca
phase
me
with
your
wicked
tongue
the
novelist
face
twisted
into
a
grotesque
smile
i
warn
you
i
will
flay
you
and
your
friends
just
the
same
you
need
it
for
the
good
of
your
soul
as
often
and
as
hard
as
you
like
returned
the
other
heartily
just
so
it
for
the
good
of
my
soul
you
will
come
you
will
permit
me
to
stand
my
share
of
the
expense
anything
you
like
if
you
will
only
come
the
older
man
said
gently
for
the
first
time
calling
the
artist
by
his
given
name
aaron
i
believe
that
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
would
really
want
me
and
i
that
you
are
the
only
person
in
the
world
to
whom
i
would
be
grateful
for
such
an
invitation
the
artist
was
about
to
reply
when
the
big
automobile
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
czar
on
the
porch
gave
a
low
growl
of
disapproval
and
through
the
open
door
they
saw
taine
and
his
wife
with
james
rutlidge
and
louise
the
novelist
said
something
under
his
breath
that
had
a
vicious
sound
quite
unlike
his
words
of
the
moment
before
czar
in
disgust
retreated
to
the
shelter
of
yee
kee
domain
with
a
laugh
the
younger
man
went
out
to
meet
his
friends
are
you
at
home
this
afternoon
sir
artist
called
taine
gaily
as
he
went
down
the
walk
i
will
always
be
at
home
to
the
right
people
he
answered
greeting
the
other
members
of
the
party
as
they
moved
toward
the
house
taine
choking
and
coughing
his
daughter
chattering
and
exclaiming
and
james
rutlidge
critically
observing
taine
dropped
a
little
back
to
aaron
king
side
and
are
you
really
established
at
last
she
asked
eagerly
with
a
charming
confidential
air
we
move
morning
he
answered
we
she
questioned
conrad
lagrange
and
i
he
is
going
to
live
with
me
you
know
oh
it
is
remarkable
how
much
meaning
a
woman
can
crowd
into
that
one
small
syllable
particularly
when
she
draws
a
little
away
from
you
as
she
speaks
it
why
he
murmured
apologetically
do
you
approve
taine
beautiful
eyebrows
went
up
inquiringly
and
why
should
i
either
approve
or
disapprove
the
young
man
was
saved
by
the
arrival
of
his
guests
at
the
porch
steps
and
by
the
appearance
of
conrad
lagrange
in
the
doorway
how
delightful
exclaimed
taine
heartily
as
she
in
turn
greeted
the
famous
novelist
king
was
just
telling
me
that
you
were
going
to
share
this
dear
little
place
with
him
i
quite
envy
you
both
the
others

passed
into
the
house
you
are
sometimes
guilty
of
saying
twisty
things
yourself
are
you
returned
the
man
and
as
he
spoke
his
remarkable
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
as
though
reading
her
innermost
thoughts
she
flushed
under
his
meaning
gaze
but
carried
it
off
gaily
with
oh
dear
i
wonder
if
my
maid
has
hooked
me
up
properly
this
time
they
left
taine
in
an
easy
chair
with
a
bottle
of
his
favorite
whisky
and
went
over
the
place
from
the
arbor
in
the
rose
garden
to

critically
and
authoritatively
approving

effervescing
the

at

with
a
pretty
air
of
proprietorship

thoughtfully
watching

aaron

himself
irresponsibly
gay
and
boyishly
proud
as
he
exhibited
his
achievements
in
the
studio

standing
before
the
big
easel
demanded
to
know
of
the
artist
when
he
would
begin
her
portrait
she
was
so
interested
so
eager
to
begin
how
soon
could
she
come
louise
assumed
a
worshipful
attitude
and
gazing
at
the
young

with
reverent
eyes
waited
breathlessly
james

drew
near
condescendingly
attentive
to
the
center
of
attraction
conrad
lagrange
turned
his
back
really
murmured
the
painter
i
hope
you
will
not
be
too
impatient
taine
i
fear
i
can
not
be
ready
for
some
time
yet
i
suppose
i
must
confess
to
being
to
my
environment
for
it
is
a
fact
that
my
working
mood
does
not
come
upon
me
readily
amid
strange
surroundings
when
i
have
become
acclimated
as
it
were
i
will
be
ready
for
you
how
wonderful
breathed
louise
quite
right
agreed
rutlidge
whenever
you
are
ready
said
taine
submissively
when
their
friends
from
the
heights
were
gone
conrad
lagrange
looked
the
artist
up
and
down
as
he
said
with
cutting
sarcasm
you
did
that
very
nicely
to
your
environment
hell
if
you
a
bit
fine
strung
you
have
no
business
to
make
a
of
it
it
a
weakness
not
a
virtue
and
the
man
who
makes
capital
out
of
any
man
weakness
even
of
his
own
is
either
a
criminal
or
a
fool
or
both
then
they
went
back
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
the
next
morning
the
artist
and
the
novelist
moved
from
the
hotel
to
establish
themselves
in
the
little
house
in
the
orange
groves
the
little
house
with
its
unobstructed
view
of
the
mountains
and
with
its
rose
garden
so
mysteriously
tended
chapter
vi
an
unknown
friend
when
yee
kee
announced
lunch
the
artist
the
novelist
and
the
dog
were
settled
in
their
new
home
in
the
afternoon
the
painter
spent
an
hour
or
two
fussing
over
portfolios
of
old
sketches
in
his
studio
while
conrad
lagrange
and
czar
lounged
on
the
front
porch
once
the
dog
rose
quietly
and
walking
sedately
to
the
edge
of
the
porch
toward
the
west
stood
for
some
minutes
gazing
intently
into
the
dark
green
mass
of
the
orange
grave
at
last
as
if
concluding
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
all
right
he
went
calmly
back
to
his
place
beside
the
novelist
chair
do
you
know
said
the
artist
as
they
sat
on
the
porch
that
evening
with
their
pipes
i
believe
this
old
place
is
haunted
if
it
is
it
ought
to
be
answered
the
other
contentedly
playing
with
czar
silky
ears
a
good
ghost
would
fit
in
nicely
here
it
or
he
or
she
its
spookship
would
travel
far
to
find
a
more
delightful
place
for
spooking
in
and
providing
of
course
she
were
a
perfectly
respectable
hant
what
a
charming
addition
to
our
family
he
would
make
when
it
was
weary
of
moping
and
mowing
and
sobbing
and
wailing
and
gibbering
she
could
curl
up
at
the
foot
of
your
bed
and
sleep
as
czar
here
curls
up
and
sleeps
at
the
foot
of
mine
a
good
ghost
you
know
if
he
becomes
really
attached
to
you
is
as
constant
and
faithful
and
affectionate
and
companionable
as
a
good
dog
said
the
artist
and
czar
turned
to
look
at
him
questioningly
all
the
same
the
painter
continued
when
i
was
out
there
in
the
studio
i
could
feel
some
one
watching
me
you
know
the
feeling
conrad
lagrange
returned
mockingly
i
trust
your
artistic
temperament
is
not
to
be
so
influenced
by
our
ghostly
visitor
that
you
will
be
unfitted
for
your
work
the
other
laughed
then
he
said
seriously
joking
aside
lagrange
i
feel
a
presentiment
i
ca
put
it
into
words
but
i
feel
that
i
going
to
begin
the
real
work
of
my
life
right
here
i
he
hesitated
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
sense
some
influence
that
i
ca
define
it
the
mystery
of
the
rose
garden
perhaps
he
finished
with
another
short
laugh
the
man
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
had
won
so
large
a
measure
of
the
success
that
his
friend
desired
and
whose
life
was
so
embittered
by
the
things
for
which
he
was
envied
by
many
made
no
reply
other
than
his
slow
twisted
smile
silently
they
watched
the
purple
shadows
of
the
mountains
deepen
and
saw
the
outlines
of
the
tawny
foothills
grow
vague
and
dim
until
they
were
lost
in
the
dusky
monotone
of
the
evening
the
last
faint
tint
of
sunset
color
went
from
the
sky
back
of
the
san
gabriels
while
close
to
the
mountain
peaks
and
ridges
the
stars
came
out
the
rows
and
the
contour
of
the
orange
groves
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
the
forms
of
the
nearby
trees
were
lost
the
rich
lustrous
green
of
their
foliage
brushed
out
with
the
dull
black
of
the
night
while
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
distant
towns
and
hamlets
in
the
valley
below
shone
as
sparkling
jewels
on
the
inky
velvet
robe
that
fold
on
fold
lay
over
the
landscape
when
the
two
had
smoked
in
silence
for
some
time
the
artist
said
slowly
you
knew
my
mother
very
well
did
you
not
mr
lagrange
we
were
children
together
aaron
as
he
spoke
the
man
deep
voice
was
gentle
as
always
when
the
young
man
mother
was
mentioned
again
for
a
little
neither
spoke
as
they
sat
looking
away
to
the
mountains
each
seemed
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
yet
each
felt
that
the
other
to
a
degree
understood
what
he
himself
was
thinking
once
more
the
artist
broke
the
silence
facing
his
mother
friend
with
quiet
resolution
as
though
he
felt
himself
forced
to
speak
but
knew
not
exactly
how
to
begin
did
you
know
her
well
after
after
my
death
and
while
i
was
abroad
the
other
bowed
his
head
yes
very
well
very
well
as
if
at
loss
for
words
aaron
king
still
hesitated
lagrange
he
said
at
last
there
are
some
things
about
about
mother
that
i
would
like
to
tell
you
that
i
think
she
would
want
me
to
tell
you
under
the
circumstances
yes
said
conrad
lagrange
gently
well
to
begin
you
know
perhaps
how
much
mother
and
i
have
always
been
his
fine
voice
broke
and
the
older
man
bowed
his
head
but
with
a
slight
lift
of
his
determined
chin
the
painter
went
on
calmly
to
each
other
after
father
death
until
i
was
seventeen
we
were
never
separated
she
was
my
only
teacher
then
i
went
away
to
school
seeing
her
only
during
my
vacations
which
we
always
spent
together
in
the
country
three
years
ago
i
went
abroad
to
finish
my
study
i
did
not
see
her
again
until
until
i
was
called
home
i
know
came
in
low
tones
from
the
other
but
sir
while
it
seemed
necessary
that
i
should
be
away
from
home
that
we
should
be
separated
all
through
this
period
we
exchanged
almost
daily
letters
planning
for
the
future
and
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
again
be
together
i
know
aaron
it
was
very
unusual
and
very
beautiful
when
we
were
together
before
i
went
away
i
was
a
mere
lad
continued
the
artist
i
knew
in
a
general
way
that
father
had
been
a
successful
lawyer
and
quite
prominent
in
politics
and
because
there
was
no
change
in
our
manner
of
living
after
his
death
and
there
seemed
to
be
always
money
for
whatever
we
wanted
i
suppose
i
assumed
thoughtlessly
that
there
would
always
be
plenty
during
the
years
while
i
was
at
school
there
was
never
in
any
way
the
slightest
hint
in
mother
letters
that
would
lead
me
to
question
the
abundance
of
her
resources
when
they
called
me
home
his
voice
broke
i
found
my
mother
dying
almost
in
poverty
our
home
stripped
of
the
art
treasures
she
loved
her
own
room
even
empty
of
everything
save
the
barest
necessities
in
bitter
sorrow
and
shame
the
young
man
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
the
novelist
his
gaunt
features
twitching
with
the
emotion
that
even
his
long
schooling
in
the
tragedies
of
life
could
not
suppress
waited
silently
when
the
artist
had
regained
in
a
measure
his
he
continued
and
every
word
came
from
him
in
shame
and
humiliation
before
she
died
she
told
me
about
my
father
in
the
settlement
of
his
affairs
at
the
time
of
his
death
it
appeared
that
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
confidence
of
certain
clients
and
had
betrayed
his
trust
appropriating
large
sums
to
his
own
interests
he
had
even
taken
advantage
of
influence
in
certain
circles
and
relying
upon
her
unquestioning
faith
in
his
integrity
had
made
her
an
unconscious
instrument
in
furthering
his
schemes
conrad
lagrange
made
as
if
to
speak
but
checked
himself
and
waited
for
the
other
to
continue
aaron
king
went
on
out
of
regard
for
my
mother
the
matter
was
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
the
one
who
suffered
the
heaviest
loss
was
able
to
protect
her
in
a
measure
all
the
others
were
fully
reimbursed
but
mother
it
would
have
been
easier
for
her
if
she
had
died
then
she
withdrew
from
her
friends
and
from
the
life
she
loved
she
denied
herself
to
all
who
sought
her
and
devoted
her
life
to
me
above
all
she
planned
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
until
i
should
be
equipped
to
win
the
place
in
the
world
that
she
coveted
for
me
it
was
for
that
she
sent
me
away
and
kept
me
from
home
as
the
demands
for
my
educational
expenses
grew
naturally
heavier
she
supplemented
the
slender
resources
left
in
the
final
settlement
of
my
father
estate
by
sacrificing
the
treasures
of
her
home
and
by
giving
up
the
luxuries
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
she
even
provided
for
me
after
her
death
not
wealth
but
a
comfortable
amount
sufficient
to
support
me
in
good
circumstances
until
i
can
gain
recognition
and
an
income
from
my
work
under
the
lash
of
his
memories
the
young
man
sprang
to
his
feet
in
god
name
lagrange
why
did
not
some
one
tell
me
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
know
i
thought
o
mother
mother
mother
why
did
you
do
it
why
was
i
not
told
all
these
years
i
have
lived
a
selfish
fool
and
you
you
i
would
have
given
up
everything
i
would
have
worked
in
a
ditch
rather
than
accept
this
the
deep
quiet
voice
of
conrad
lagrange
broke
the
stillness
that
followed
the
storm
of
the
artist
passionate
words
and
that
is
the
answer
aaron
she
knew
too
well
that
you
would
not
have
accepted
her
sacrifice
if
you
had
known
that
is
why
she
kept
the
secret
until
you
had
finished
your
education
she
forbade
her
friends
she
forbade
me
to
interfere
and
do
you
see
that
she
was
right
do
you
see
it
we
would
have
done
her
the
greatest
injustice
if
we
had
against
her
will
deprived
her
of
this
privilege
her
splendid
pride
her
high
sense
of
honor
her
nobility
of
spirit
demanded
the
sacrifice
it
was
her
right
god
forgive
me
i
tried
to
make
her
see
it
otherwise
but
she
knew
best
she
always
knew
best
aaron
her
only
hope
of
regaining
for
you
that
and
that
position
in
life
to
which
you
by
right
of
birth
and
natural
endowment
are
entitled
was
in
you
the
name
which
she
had
given
to
you
could
be
restored
to
honor
by
you
only
to
train
and
equip
you
for
your
work
and
to
enable
you
unhampered
by
need
to
gain
your
footing
was
the
determined
passion
of
her
life
her
sacrifice
her
suffering
to
that
end
was
the
only
restitution
she
could
make
to
you
for
that
which
your
father
had
squandered
her
proud
spirit
her
fine
intelligence
her
mother
love
for
you
demanded
it
i
know
returned
the
artist
she
told
me
before
she
died
she
made
me
understand
she
said
that
it
was
my
inheritance
she
asked
for
my
promise
that
i
would
be
true
to
her
purpose
her
last
words
were
an
expression
of
her
confidence
that
i
would
not
disappoint
her
that
i
would
win
a
place
and
name
that
would
wipe
out
the
shame
of
my
father
dishonor
and
i
will
lagrange
i
must
mother
mother
shall
not
be
disappointed
she
shall
not
be
disappointed
no
said
the
older
man
so
softly
that
the
other
torn
by
the
passion
of
his
own
thoughts
did
not
hear
no
aaron
your
mother
will
not
be
disappointed
for
a
time
longer
they
sat
in
silence
then
the
young
man
said
i
wish
i
knew
the
name
of
my
mother
friend
the
one
who
suffered
the
heaviest
loss
through
my
father
and
who
so
generously
protected
her
in
the
crisis
i
would
like
to
thank
him
at
least
i
begged
her
to
tell
me
but
she
would
not
she
said
he
would
not
want
me
to
know
that
for
me
to
attempt
to
reimburse
him
would
to
his
mind
rob
him
of
his
real
reward
conrad
lagrange
his
head
bowed
spoke
quietly
to
the
dog
at
his
feet
rising
czar
laid
his
soft
muzzle
on
his
master
knee
and
looked
up
into
the
homely
face
gently
the
strange
man
so
lonely
and
embittered
in
the
fame
that
he
had
won
at
a
price
stroked
the
brown
head
your
mother
knew
best
aaron
he
said
slowly
without
looking
at
his
companion
you
must
believe
that
she
knew
best
her
beautiful
spirit
could
not
lead
her
astray
she
was
right
in
this
also
your
sentiment
does
you
honor
but
you
must
respect
her
wish
whoever
the
man
was
she
had
reasons
i
am
sure
for
feeling
as
she
did
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
not
to
know
it
was
some
one
perhaps
whose
influence
upon
you
she
had
cause
to
fear
it
was
very
strange
returned
the
artist
hesitatingly
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
it
but
i
felt
that
as
you
suggest
she
feared
for
me
to
know
she
seemed
to
want
to
tell
me
but
did
not
for
sake
it
was
very
strange
conrad
lagrange
made
no
reply
i
wanted
you
to
know
about
mother
continued
the
artist
because
i
would
like
you
to
understand
why
why
i
must
succeed
in
my
work
the
older
man
smiled
to
himself
in
the
dusk
i
have
always
known
why
you
must
succeed
aaron
he
returned
i
have
never
questioned
your
motives
i
question
only
your
understanding
of
success
i
question
if
you
will
pardon
me
your
understanding
of
your
mother
wish
for
you
then
in
one
of
those
rare
momentary
moods
when
he
seemed
to
reveal
to
his
young
friend
his
real
nature
that
lay
so
deeply
hidden
from
the
world
he
added
you
are
right
aaron
this
place
haunted
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
the
mountains
yonder
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
the
rose
garden
out
there
the
silent
strength
of
the
hills
and
the
loveliness
of
the
garden
will
attend
you
in
your
studio
as
you
work
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
feel
a
presentiment
that
your
artistic
future
is
to
be
shaped
here
for
between
these
influences
and
the
other
influences
that
will
be
brought
to
bear
upon
you
you
will
be
forced
to
decide
may
the
god
of
all
true
art
and
artists
help
you
to
make
no
mistake
listen
as
though
in
answer
to
the
solemn
words
of
the
man
who
spoke
from
the
fullness
of
a
experience
and
from
the
depths
of
a
love
a
strain
of
music
came
from
out
the
fragrant
darkness
somewhere
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
orange
grove
the
soul
of
a
true
musician
was
seeking
expression
in
the
tones
of
a
violin
softly
sadly
with
poignant
clearness
the
music
lifted
into
the
night
low
and
pleadingly
at
first
then
stronger
and
more
vibrant
with
feeling
as
though
sweetly
insistent
in
its
call
swelling
next
in
volume
and
passion
as
though
in
warning
of
some
threatening
evil
ringing
with
loving
fear
sobbing
wailing
moaning
in
anguish
clearly
gloriously
triumphant
at
last
then
sinking
into
solemn
reverent
benediction
losing
itself
finally
in
the
darkness
even
as
it
had
come
the
two
men
so
fashioned
by
nature
to
receive
such
music
listened
with
emotions
they
could
not
have
put
into
words
for
the
moment
the
music
to
them
was
the
voice
of
the
guarding
calling
warning
spirit
of
the
mountains
that
in
their
calm
majestic
strength
were
so
far
removed
from
the
petty
passions
and
longings
of
the
baser
world
at
their
feet
it
was
the
voice
of
the
loving
intimacy
the
sweet
purity
and
the
sacred
beauty
of
the
spirit
of
the
garden
it
was
as
though
the
things
of
which
conrad
lagrange
had
just
spoken
so
reverently
had
cried
aloud
to
them
out
of
the
night
in
confirmation
of
his
words
chapter
vii
taine
in
quaker
gray
aaron
king
seemed
loth
to
begin
his
work
on
the
portrait
of
taine
day
after
day
without
apparent
reason
he
put
it
off
spending
the
hours
in
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
place
idling
on
the
porch
or
doing
nothing
in
his
studio
he
would
start
from
the
house
to
the
building
at
the
end
of
the
rose
garden
as
though
moved
by
some
clearly
defined
purpose
and
then
for
an
hour
or
more
would
dawdle
among
the
things
of
his
craft
with
irresolute
mind
turning
over
his
sketches
and
drawings
with
uncertain
hands
as
though
searching
for
something
he
knew
was
not
there
toying
with
his
paints
and
brushes
or
sitting
before
his
empty
easel
looking
away
through
the
big
window
to
the
distant
mountains
he
seemed
incapable
of
fixing
his
mind
upon
the
task
to
which
he
attached
so
much
importance
several
times
taine
called
but
he
begged
her
to
be
patient
and
she
with
pretended
awe
of
the
moods
of
genius
waited
conrad
lagrange
jeered
and
mocked
offered
sneering
advice
or
sarcastic
compliment
and
under
it
all
was
keenly
watchful
and
sympathetic
understanding
better
than
the
artist
himself
perhaps
the
secret
of
the
painter
hesitation
every
day
sometimes
in
the
morning
sometimes
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
unseen
musician
in
the
orange
grove
wrought
for
them
melodie
that
whether
grave
or
gay
always
carried
somehow
the
feeling
that
had
so
moved
them
in
the
mysterious
darkness
of
that
first
evening
they
knew
now
of
course
that
the
musician
lived
in
the
neighboring
house
the
gable
and
chimney
of
which
was
just
visible
above
the
but
that
was
all
obedient
to
some
whimsical
impulse
that
prompted
them
both
and
was
born
no
doubt
of
the
circumstance
and
mood
of
that
first
evening
they
did
not
seek
to
learn
more
they
feared
though
they
did
not
say
it
that
to
learn
the
identity
of
the
musician
would
rob
them
of
the
peculiar
pleasure
they
found
in
the
music
itself
so
they
spoke
always
of
their
unknown
neighbor
in
a
fanciful
vein
as
in
like
humor
they
spoke
of
the
spirit
that
aaron
king
still
insisted
haunted
the
place
or
as
they
alluded
to
the
mystery
of
the
carefully
tended
rose
garden
when
the
artist
could
put
it
off
no
longer
a
day
was
finally
set
when
taine
was
to
come
for
the
beginning
of
her
portrait
the
appointed
hour
found
the
artist
in
his
studio
a
canvas
stood
ready
upon
the
easel
palette
colors
and
brushes
were
at
hand
the
painter
was
standing
at
the
big
north
window
looking
up
away
to
the
mountains
the
mountains
that
the
novelist
said
called
so
insistently
suddenly
he
turned
his
head
to
listen
sweetly
clear
and
low
through
the
green
wall
of
the
came
the
music
of
that
hidden
violin
as
he
stood
there
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
mountains
listening
to
the
spirit
that
spoke
in
the
tones
of
the
unseen
instrument
aaron
king
knew
all
at
once
that
the
passing
moment
was
one
of
those
rare
moments
that
come
all
unexpectedly
when
with
prophetic
vision
one
sees
clearly
the
end
of
the
course
he
pursues
and
the
destiny
that
waits
him
at
its
completion
as
clearly
too
he
saw
the
other
way
and
knew
the
meaning
of
the
vision
but
seldom
is
the
strength
given
to
man
in
such
moments
to
choose
for
himself
though
he
may
see
the
other
way
clearly
his
feet
cling
to
the
path
he
has
elected
to
follow
nor
will
he
unless
some
one
takes
him
by
the
hand
saying
come
turn
aside
a
voice
not
at
all
in
harmony
with
the
music
broke
upon
the
consciousness
he
turned
to
see
taine
standing
expectantly
in
the
open
door
hush
said
the
painter
still
under
the
spell
of
that
moment
so
big
with
possibilities
listen
with
a
gesture
he
checked
her
advance
listen
a
look
of
haughty
surprise
flashed
over
the
woman
too
perfect
features
then
as
her
ear
caught
the
tones
of
the
violin
she
half
turned
but
only
for
a
moment
very
clever
is
it
she
said
as
she
came
forward
it
must
be
old
professor
becker
he
lives
somewhere
around
here
i
understand
they
say
he
is
very
good
the
artist
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
in
amazement
then
as
his
normal
mind
asserted
itself
he
burst
into
an
embarrassed
laugh
at
her
look
of
puzzled
inquiry
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
taine
i
did
not
realize
how
harshly
i
greeted
you
the
fact
is
i
i
was
dreaming
he
turned
suggestively
toward
the
canvas
upon
the
easel
you
see
i
was
expecting
you
i
was
thinking
then
the
music
came
and
well
when
you
actually
appeared
in
the
flesh
i
did
not
for
the
moment
realize
that
it
was
really
you
how
charming
of
you
she
returned
to
be
made
the
subject
of
an
artist
dream
really
it
is
quite
the
nicest
compliment
i
have
ever
received
tell
me
do
you
like
me
in
this
she
slipped
the
wrap
she
wore
from
her
shoulders
and
stood
before
him
gowned
in
the
simple
gray
dress
of
a
quaker
maid
deliberately
she
turned
her
beautiful
self
about
for
his
critical
inspection
moving
to
and
fro
sitting
standing
in
various
graceful
poses
she
invited
challenged
dared
his
closest
attention
professional
attention
of
course
to
every
curve
and
detail
in
spite
of
its
simplicity
of
color
and
line
the
gown
still
bore
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
the
wearer
world
the
severity
of
line
was
subtly
made
to
emphasize
the
voluptuousness
of
the
body
that
was
covered
but
not
hidden
the
quiet
color
was
made
to
accentuate
the
flesh
the
dress
concealed
only
to
reveal
the
very
lack
of
ornament
but
served
to
center
the
attention
upon
the
charms
that
so
loudly
professed
to
scorn
them
it
was
worldliness
speaking
in
the
quiet
voice
of
religion
it
was
vulgarity
advertising
itself
in
terms
of
good
taste
she
had
made
modesty
the
handmaiden
of
blatant
immodesty
and
the
daring
impudence
of
it
all
fairly
stunned
the
painter
oh
dear
she
said
watching
his
face
i
fear
you
do
like
it
at
all
and
i
thought
it
such
a
beautiful
little
gown
you
told
me
to
wear
whatever
i
pleased
you
know
it
a
beautiful
gown
he
said
then
added
impulsively
and
you
are
beautiful
in
it
you
would
be
beautiful
in
anything
she
shook
her
head
favoring
him
with
an
understanding
smile
you
say
that
to
please
me
i
can
see
that
you
do
like
me
this
way
but
i
do
he
insisted
i
like
you
that
way
immensely
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
all
you
see
i
thought
of
course
that
you
would
select
an
evening
gown
of
some
sort
something
you
know
that
would
fit
your
social
position
your
place
in
the
world
in
this
costume
the
beauty
of
your
shoulders
lowering
her
eyes
as
if
embarrassed
she
said
coldly
the
beauty
of
my
shoulders
is
not
for
the
public
i
have
never
worn
i
will
not
wear
one
of
those
dreadful
immodest
gowns
aaron
king
was
bewildered
suddenly
he
remembered
what
conrad
lagrange
had
said
about
her
fad
but
after
so
frankly
exhibiting
herself
before
him
dressed
as
she
was
in
a
gown
that
was
deliberately
planned
to
advertise
her
physical
charms
to
be
particular
about
baring
her
shoulders
in
a
conventional
costume
it
was
quite
too
much
again
i
beg
your
pardon
taine
he
managed
to
say
i
did
not
know
under
the
circumstances
this
is
exactly
the
thing
your
portrait
in
what
is
so
frankly
a
costume
assumed
for
the
purpose
takes
us
out
of
the
dilemma
very
nicely
indeed
why
that
exactly
what
i
thought
she
returned
eagerly
and
this
is
so
in
keeping
with
my
real
tastes
do
you
see
a
real
portrait
i
mean
a
serious
work
of
art
you
know
should
always
be
something
more
than
a
mere
likeness
should
it
not
do
you
think
that
to
be
genuinely
good
a
portrait
must
reveal
the
spirit
and
character
must
portray
the
soul
as
well
as
the
features
i
so
want
this
to
be
a
truly
great
picture
for
your
sake
her
manner
seemed
to
say
that
she
was
doing
it
all
for
him
i
have
never
permitted
any
one
to
paint
my
portrait
before
you
know
she
added
meaningly
you
are
very
kind
taine
he
returned
gravely
believe
me
i
do
appreciate
this
opportunity
i
shall
do
my
best
to
express
my
appreciation
here
he
indicated
the
canvas
on
the
easel
when
his
sitter
was
posed
to
his
liking
and
the
artist
with
a
few
bold
sweeping
strokes
of
the
charcoal
had
roughed
out
his
subject
on
the
canvas
and
was
bending
over
his
he
said
casually
to
put
her
at
ease
you
came
alone
this
afternoon
did
you
oh
no
indeed
i
brought
louise
with
me
i
shall
always
bring
her
or
some
one
one
can
not
be
too
careful
you
know
she
added
with
simulated
artlessness
the
painter
studying
her
face
replied
mechanically
no
indeed
as
he
turned
back
to
his
canvas
taine
continued
i
left
her
in
the
house
with
a
box
of
chocolates
and
a
novel
i
felt
that
you
would
rather
we
were
alone
please
do
look
down
said
the
artist
i
want
your
eyes
about
here
he
indicated
a
picture
on
the
wall
a
little
back
and
to
the
left
of
where
he
stood
at
the
easel
after
this
there
was
silence
in
the
studio
for
a
little
while
taine
obediently
kept
the
pose
her
eyes
upon
the
point
the
artist
had
indicated
but
as
the
man
himself
was
almost
directly
in
her
line
of
vision
it
was
easy
for
her
to
watch
him
at
his
work
when
his
eyes
were
on
his
canvas
or
palette
the
arrangement
was
admirable
in
that
it
relieved
the
tedium
of
the
hour
for
the
sitter
and
gave
her
face
an
expression
of
animated
interest
that
truthfully
fixed
upon
the
canvas
should
insure
the
fame
and
future
of
any
painter
it
would
be
quite
too
much
to
say
that
aaron
king
became
absorbed
in
his
occupation
thorough
master
of
the
tools
of
his
craft
and
of
his
own
technic
as
well
he
was
interested
in
the
mere
exercising
of
his
skill
but
he
in
no
sense
lost
himself
in
his
work
two
or
three
times
taine
saw
him
glance
quickly
over
his
shoulder
as
though
expecting
some
one
once
for
quite
a
moment
he
deliberately
turned
from
his
easel
to
stand
at
the
window
looking
up
at
the
distant
mountain
peaks
several
times
he
seemed
to
be
listening
may
i
talk
she
said
at
last
why
certainly
he
returned
i
want
you
to
feel
perfectly
at
ease
you
must
be
altogether
at
home
here
just
let
yourself
go
say
what
you
like
with
no
conventional
restraints
whatever
consider
me
a
mechanical
something
that
is
no
more
than
an
article
of
furniture
be
as
thoroughly
yourself
as
if
alone
in
your
own
room
how
funny
she
said
musingly
not
at
all
he
returned
just
a
matter
of
business
but
it
be
funny
if
i
were
to
take
you
at
your
word
she
replied
suddenly
breaking
the
pose
and
meeting
his
gaze
squarely
is
it
is
it
quite
necessary
for
the
mechanical
something
to
look
at
me
like
that
i
said
that
you
were
to
me
as
an
article
of
furniture
i
did
say
that
i
like
a
table
or
chair
oh
do
look
down
keep
the
pose
please
came
somewhat
sharply
from
the
man
at
the
easel
as
though
he
were
mentally
taking
himself
in
hand
after
that
she
watched
him
with
increasing
interest
and
when
he
turned
his
head
in
that
listening
attitude
a
curious
resentful
light
came
into
her
eyes
presently
she
asked
abruptly
what
is
it
that
you
hear
i
thought
i
heard
music
he
answered
coloring
slightly
and
turning
to
his
work
with
suddenly
absorbing
interest
the
violin
that
so
enchanted
you
when
i
came
to
break
the
spell
she
persisted
playfully
though
the
light
in
her
eyes
was
not
a
playful
light
yes
he
answered
shortly
stepping
back
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
for
a
careful
look
at
his
canvas
and
do
you
know
who
it
is
you
said
it
was
an
old
professor
somebody
that
was
my
guess
she
retorted
was
i
right
i
do
know
but
it
comes
from
that
little
box
of
a
house
next
door
does
it
evidently
the
artist
answered
then
laying
aside
his
palette
and
brushes
he
said
abruptly
that
is
all
for
thank
you
oh
so
soon
she
exclaimed
and
the
regret
in
her
voice
was
very
pleasing
to
the
man
who
was
decidedly
not
a
mechanical
something
she
started
eagerly
forward
toward
the
easel
but
the
artist
with
a
quick
motion
drew
a
curtain
across
the
canvas
to
hide
his
work
while
he
checked
her
with
not
yet
please
i
do
want
you
to
see
it
until
i
say
you
may
how
mean
of
you
she
protested
charmingly
submissive
then
eagerly
and
do
you
want
me
you
do
do
you
yes
please
at
the
same
hour
when
the
quaker
maiden
dress
was
safely
hidden
under
her
wrap
taine
stood
for
a
moment
looking
thoughtfully
about
the
studio
while
the
artist
waited
at
the
door
ready
to
escort
her
to
the
automobile
i
am
going
to
love
this
room
she
said
slowly
and
for
the
first
time
her
voice
was
genuinely
sincere
with
a
hint
of
wistfulness
in
its
tone
that
made
him
regard
her
wonderingly
she
went
to
him
impulsively
will
you
when
you
are
famous
when
you
are
a
great
artist
and
all
the
great
and
famous
people
go
to
you
to
have
their
portraits
painted
will
you
remember
poor
me
i
wonder
am
i
really
going
to
be
famous
he
returned
doubtfully
are
you
so
sure
that
this
picture
will
mean
success
of
course
i
am
sure
i
you
want
to
succeed
do
you
aaron
king
returned
her
look
for
a
moment
without
answering
then
with
a
quick
fierce
determination
that
betrayed
a
depth
of
feeling
she
had
never
before
seen
in
him
he
exclaimed
do
i
want
to
succeed
i
i
must
succeed
i
tell
you
i
and
the
woman
answered
very
softly
with
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
you
shall
you
shall
conrad
lagrange
and
czar
found
the
artist
on
the
front
porch
pulling
moodily
at
his
pipe
is
it
all
over
for
asked
the
novelist
as
he
stood
looking
down
upon
the
young
man
with
that
peculiarly
piercing
baffling
gaze
all
over
replied
the
artist
answering
the
greeting
thrust
of
muzzle
against
his
knee
with
caressing
hand
where
did
you
fly
to
the
other
dropped
into
a
chair
i
would
fly
anywhere
to
escape
being
entertained
by
that
ragtime
piece
of
human
nonentity
louise
taine
i
saw
them
coming
just
in
time
he
was
filling
his
pipe
as
he
spoke
and
how
did
the
work
go
all
right
replied
the
painter
indifferently
the
older
man
shot
a
curious
sidewise
glance
at
his
moody
companion
then
striking
a
match
he
gave
careful
attention
to
his
pipe
watching
the
cloud
of
blue
smoke
he
said
quizzingly
i
suppose
majesty
was
royally
apparelled
for
the
arrayed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
as
befits
the
dignity
of
her
state
the
artist
turned
at
the
mocking
suggestive
tone
and
answered
savagely
i
suppose
you
have
got
to
know
damn
you
i
painting
her
as
a
quaker
maiden
conrad
lagrange
reply
was
as
surprising
in
its
way
as
was
the
outburst
of
the
artist
instead
of
the
tirade
of
biting
sarcasm
and
stinging
abuse
that
the
painter
expected
the
older
man
only
gazed
at
him
from
under
his
scowling
brows
and
shaking
his
head
sadly
said
with
sincere
regret
and
understanding
you
poor
fellow
it
must
be
hell
then
as
his
keen
mind
grasped
the
full
significance
of
the
artist
words
he
murmured
meditatively
the
personification
of
the
age
masquerading
in
quaker
gray
shades
of
the
giants
who
used
to
be
what
an
opportunity
if
you
only
had
the
nerve
to
do
it
the
artist
flung
out
his
hand
in
protest
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
to
pace
up
and
down
the
porch
do
lagrange
do
i
ca
stand
it
just
now
all
right
said
the
other
heartily
i
wo
rising
he
put
his
hand
on
his
friend
shoulder
come
let
go
for
a
look
at
the
roses
before
yee
kee
calls
us
to
dinner
in
the
garden
the
artist
eye
caught
sight
of
something
white
lying
in
the
path
with
an
exclamation
he
went
quickly
to
pick
it
up
it
was
a
dainty
square
of
lace
a
handkerchief
with
an
exquisitely
embroidered
s
in
the
corner
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
with
smiling
questioning
eyes
chapter
viii
the
portrait
that
was
not
a
portrait
aaron
king
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
his
portrait
of
the
woman
who
conrad
lagrange
said
was
the
personification
of
the
age
from
that
evening
when
the
young
man
told
his
friend
the
story
of
his
mother
sacrifice
their
friendship
had
become
like
that
friendship
which
passeth
the
love
of
women
while
the
novelist
true
to
his
promise
did
not
cease
to
flay
his
younger
companion
for
the
good
of
the
soul
those
moments
when
his
gentler
moods
ruled
his
speech
were
perhaps
more
frequent
and
the
artist
was
more
and
more
learning
to
appreciate
the
rare
imagination
the
delicacy
of
feeling
the
intellectual
brilliancy
and
the
keenness
of
mental
vision
that
distinguished
the
man
whose
life
was
so
embittered
by
the
use
he
had
made
of
his
own
rich
gifts
the
novelist
steadily
refused
to
look
at
the
picture
while
the
work
was
in
progress
he
said
bluntly
that
he
preferred
to
run
no
risk
of
interfering
with
the
young
man
chance
for
fame
and
that
it
would
be
quite
enough
for
him
to
look
upon
his
friend
shame
when
it
was
accomplished
without
witnessing
the
process
in
its
various
stages
the
artist
laughed
to
hide
the
embarrassing
fact
that
he
was
rather
pleased
to
be
left
to
himself
with
this
particular
picture
conrad
lagrange
did
not
however
refuse
to
accompany
his
friend
occasionally
to
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
where
the
painter
continued
to
spend
much
of
his
time
when
taine
made
mocking
references
to
the
novelist
promise
not
to
leave
the
artist
unprotected
to
her
tender
mercies
he
always
answered
with
some
as
she
said
twisty
saying
to
the
effect
that
the
present
situation
in
no
way
lessened
his
determination
to
save
the
young
man
from
the
influences
that
would
accomplish
the
ruin
of
his
genius
if
he
always
added
if
he
is
worth
saving
which
remains
to
be
seen
always
at
the
taine
home
they
met
james
rutlidge
frequently
the
celebrated
critic
dropped
in
at
the
cottage
in
the
orange
grove
under
the
skillful
management
of
rutlidge
at
the
request
of
taine
the
newspapers
were
already
busy
with
the
name
and
work
of
aaron
king
true
the
critic
had
never
seen
the
artist
work
but
the
papers
and
magazines
throughout
the
country
often
mentioned
the
high
order
of
the
painter
genius
there
were
little
stories
of
his
study
and
success
abroad
tactful
references
to
his
aristocratic
family
entertaining
accounts
of
his
romantic
life
with
the
famous
novelist
in
the
orange
groves
of
fairlands
and
of
how
in
his
california
studio
among
the
roses
the
distinguished
painter
was
at
work
upon
a
portrait
of
the
social
leader
taine
this
being
the
first
portrait
ever
painted
of
that
famous
beauty
that
the
picture
would
create
a
sensation
at
the
exhibition
was
the
unanimous
verdict
of
all
who
had
been
permitted
to
see
the
marvelous
creation
by
this
rare
genius
whose
work
was
so
little
known
in
this
country
said
conrad
lagrange
it
is
all
so
easy
once
or
twice
the
artist
or
his
friend
had
seen
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
and
the
novelist
still
tried
in
vain
to
fix
her
in
his
memory
every
day
they
heard
in
the
depths
of
the
neighboring
orange
grove
the
music
of
that
unseen
violin
they
spoke
often
in
playful
mood
of
the
spirit
that
haunted
the
place
but
they
made
no
effort
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
carefully
tended
rose
garden
they
knew
that
whoever
cared
for
the
roses
worked
there
only
in
the
early
morning
hours
and
they
carefully
avoided
going
into
the
yard
back
of
the
house
until
after
breakfast
they
felt
that
an
investigation
might
rob
them
of
the
peculiar
humor
of
their
fancy
a
fancy
that
was
to
them
both
such
a
pleasure
and
gave
to
their
home
amid
the
and
roses
such
an
added
charm
but
the
other
member
of
the
trio
of
friends
was
not
so
reticent
czar
had
formed
an
to
his
most
proper
dogship
unusual
habit
frequently
when
the
three
were
sitting
on
the
porch
in
the
evening
he
would
rise
suddenly
from
his
place
beside
his
master
chair
and
walking
sedately
to
the
side
of
the
porch
facing
that
neighboring
gable
and
chimney
would
stand
listening
attentively
then
without
so
much
as
a
he
would
leap
to
the
ground
and
vanish
somewhere
around
the
corner
of
the
house
later
he
would
come
sedately
back
greeting
each
in
turn
with
that
insistent
thrust
his
soft
muzzle
against
a
knee
and
assuring
them
in
the
wordless
speech
of
his
expressive
brown
eyes
that
his
mission
had
been
a
most
proper
one
and
that
they
might
trust
him
to
make
no
foolish
mistakes
that
would
mar
the
peace
and
harmony
of
their
little
household
the
men
never
failed
to
agree
with
him
that
it
was
all
right
in
fact
so
fully
did
they
trust
him
that
they
never
even
stepped
to
the
corner
of
the
porch
to
see
where
he
went
nor
would
they
leave
their
chairs
until
he
had
returned
upon
those
days
when
taine
came
to
the
studio
being
always
careful
that
louise
accompanied
her
as
far
as
the
house
conrad
lagrange
vanished
the
man
swore
by
all
the
strange
and
wonderful
gods
he
knew
and
they
were
many
that
he
feared
to
spend
an
hour
with
that
effervescing
young
female
devotee
of
the
arts
lest
the
mountains
in
their
wrath
should
fall
upon
him
but
that
day
when
taine
came
for
the
last
sitting
the
novelist
engaged
in
interesting
talk
with
the
artist
forgot
you
are
caught
cried
the
painter
gleefully
as
the
big
automobile
stopped
at
the
gate
i
be
damned
if
i
am
retorted
the
novelist
with
no
profane
intent
but
with
meaning
quite
literal
and
seizing
a
book
he
bolted
through
the
kitchen
nearly
upsetting
the
startled
yee
kee
what
matte
inquired
the
chinaman
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
his
almond
eyes
as
wide
as
they
could
go
with
an
expression
of
celestial
consternation
that
convulsed
the
artist
catching
sight
of
the
automobile
his
oriental
features
wrinkled
into
a
yellow
grin
of
understanding
oh
see
um
come
ha
i
know
he
all
time
go
she
come
he
say
no
like
lagtime
gal
dog
cza
him
all
time
gone
too
him
no
like
lagtime
all
same
miste
laglange
ha
i
go
too
and
he
in
turn
vanished
you
are
early
said
aaron
king
as
he
escorted
taine
to
the
studio
just
inside
the
door
she
turned
impulsively
to
face
him
standing
close
her
beautifully
groomed
and
voluptuous
body
instinct
with
the
lure
of
her
sex
her
too
perfect
features
slightly
flushed
and
her
eyes
submissively
downcast
and
have
you
forgotten
that
this
is
the
last
time
i
can
come
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
surely
not
he
returned
calmly
you
are
coming
with
the
others
are
you
her
husband
with
james
rutlidge
and
louise
taine
were
invited
for
the
next
day
to
view
the
portrait
oh
but
that
will
be
so
different
she
loosed
the
wrap
she
wore
and
threw
it
aside
with
an
indescribable
familiar
gesture
you
do
realize
what
these
hours
have
meant
to
me
how
could
you
you
do
not
live
in
my
world
your
world
is
is
so
different
you
do
not
know
you
do
not
know
with
a
sudden
burst
of
passion
she
added
the
world
that
i
live
in
is
hell
and
this
this
oh
it
has
been
heavenly
her
words
her
voice
the
poise
of
her
figure
the
gesture
with
outstretched
arms
it
was
all
so
nearly
an
invitation
so
nearly
a
surrender
of
herself
to
him
that
the
man
started
forward
impulsively
for
the
moment
he
forgot
his
work
he
forgot
everything
he
was
conscious
only
of
the
woman
who
stood
before
him
but
even
as
the
light
of
triumph
blazed
up
in
the
woman
eyes
the
man
halted
drew
back
and
his
face
was
turned
from
her
as
he
listened
to
the
sweetly
appealing
message
of
the
gentle
spirit
that
made
itself
felt
in
the
music
of
that
hidden
violin
it
was
as
though
in
truth
the
mountains
themselves
from
their
calm
heights
so
remote
from
the
little
world
wherein
men
live
their
baser
tragedies
watched
over
him
do
you
think
we
had
better
proceed
with
our
work
he
said
calmly
the
light
in
the
woman
eyes
changed
to
anger
which
she
turned
away
to
hide
without
replying
she
went
to
her
place
and
assumed
the
pose
and
as
she
had
watched
him
day
after
day
when
his
eyes
were
upon
the
canvas
she
watched
him
now
since
that
first
day
when
she
had
questioned
him
about
the
unseen
musician
they
had
not
mentioned
the
subject
although
as
was
inevitable
under
the
circumstances
their
intimacy
had
grown
but
not
once
had
he
turned
from
his
work
in
that
listening
attitude
or
looked
from
the
window
as
though
some
one
without
her
noting
it
and
always
her
eyes
had
flashed
with
resentment
which
she
had
promptly
concealed
when
the
painter
again
turning
to
his
easel
had
looked
from
his
canvas
to
her
face
scarcely
was
the
artist
well
started
in
his
work
that
afternoon
when
the
music
ceased
presently
taine
broke
her
watchful
silence
with
the
quite
casual
remark
your
musical
neighbor
is
still
unknown
to
you
i
suppose
yes
he
answered
smiling
as
though
more
to
himself
than
at
her
we
have
never
tried
to
make
her
acquaintance
the
woman
caught
him
up
quickly
to
make
acquaintance
why
do
you
say
if
you
do
not
know
who
it
is
the
artist
was
confused
did
i
say
he
questioned
his
face
flushed
with
embarrassment
it
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
neither
conrad
lagrange
nor
i
know
anything
about
our
neighbor
she
laughed
ironically
and
you
know
so
easily
i
suppose
so
but
we
have
never
cared
to
we
prefer
to
accept
the
music
as
it
comes
to
us
impersonally
for
what
it
is
not
for
whoever
makes
it
he
spoke
coldly
as
though
the
subject
was
distasteful
to
him
under
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
but
the
woman
persisted
well
know
who
it
is
shall
i
tell
you
no
i
do
not
care
to
know
i
am
not
interested
in
the
musician
oh
but
you
might
be
you
know
she
retorted
please
take
the
pose
returned
aaron
king
professionally
taine
wisely
for
the
time
dropped
the
subject
contenting
herself
with
a
meaning
laugh
the
artist
silently
gave
all
his
attention
to
the
nearly
finished
portrait
he
was
not
painting
now
with
full
brush
and
swift
sure
strokes
as
had
been
his
way
when
building
up
his
picture
but
worked
with
occasional
deft
touches
here
and
there
drawing
back
from
the
canvas
often
to
study
it
intently
his
eyes
glancing
swiftly
from
the
picture
to
the
sitter
face
and
back
again
to
the
portrait
then
stepping
forward
quickly
ready
brush
in
hand
to
withdraw
an
instant
later
for
another
long
and
searching
study
presently
with
an
air
of
relief
he
laid
aside
his
palette
and
brushes
and
turning
to
taine
with
a
smile
held
out
his
hand
come
he
said
tell
me
if
i
have
done
well
or
it
is
finished
she
cried
i
may
see
it
it
is
all
that
i
can
do
he
answered
come
he
led
her
to
the
easel
where
they
stood
side
by
side
before
his
work
the
picture
still
fresh
from
the
painter
brush
was
a
portrait
of
taine
yet
not
a
portrait
exquisite
in
coloring
and
in
its
harmony
of
tone
and
line
it
betrayed
in
every
careful
detail
in
every
mark
of
the
brush
the
thoughtful
painstaking
care
the
thorough
knowledge
and
highly
trained
skill
of
an
artist
who
was
at
least
master
of
his
own
technic
but
if
one
might
say
so
the
painting
was
more
a
picture
than
a
portrait
the
face
upon
the
canvas
was
the
face
of
taine
indeed
in
that
the
features
were
her
features
but
it
was
also
the
face
of
a
sweetly
modest
quaker
maid
the
too
perfect
too
well
cared
for
face
of
the
beautiful
woman
of
the
world
was
on
the
canvas
given
the
charm
of
a
natural
unconscious
loveliness
the
eyes
that
had
watched
the
artist
with
such
certain
knowledge
of
life
and
with
the
boldness
born
of
that
knowledge
were
in
the
picture
beautiful
with
the
charm
of
innocent
maidenhood
the
very
coloring
and
the
arrangement
of
the
hair
were
changed
subtly
to
express
not
the
skill
of
and
of
fashionable
but
the
instinctive
care
of
womanliness
the
costume
that
when
worn
by
the
woman
expressed
so
fully
her
true
character
in
the
picture
became
the
emblem
of
a
pure
and
deeply
religious
spirit
taine
turned
impulsively
to
the
artist
and
placing
her
hand
upon
his
arm
exclaimed
in
delight
oh
is
it
true
am
i
really
so
beautiful
the
artist
laughed
you
like
it
like
it
how
could
i
help
liking
it
it
is
lovely
i
am
glad
he
returned
i
hoped
it
would
please
you
and
you
she
asked
with
eager
eyes
are
you
satisfied
with
it
does
it
seem
good
to
you
oh
as
for
that
he
answered
i
suppose
one
is
never
satisfied
i
know
the
work
is
good
in
a
way
but
it
is
very
far
from
what
it
should
be
i
fear
i
feel
that
after
all
i
have
not
made
the
most
of
my
opportunity
he
spoke
with
a
shade
of
sadness
again
she
put
out
her
hand
impulsively
to
touch
his
arm
as
she
answered
eagerly
ah
but
no
one
else
will
say
that
no
one
else
will
dare
it
will
be
the
sensation
of
the
year
i
tell
you
just
you
wait
until
jim
rutlidge
sees
it
wait
until
it
is
hung
for
exhibition
and
he
tells
the
world
about
it
everybody
worth
while
will
be
coming
to
you
then
and
i
i
will
remember
these
hours
with
you
and
be
glad
that
i
could
help
even
so
little
will
you
remember
them
too
i
wonder
are
you
glad
the
picture
is
finished
and
are
you
not
glad
he
returned
meaningly
they
had
both
forgotten
the
painting
before
them
they
did
not
see
it
they
each
saw
only
the
other
no
i
am
not
glad
she
said
in
a
low
tone
people
would
very
soon
be
talking
if
i
should
come
here
alone
now
that
the
picture
is
finished
i
suppose
in
any
case
you
will
be
leaving
fairlands
soon
for
the
summer
he
returned
slowly
o
listen
she
cried
with
quick
eagerness
we
are
going
to
lake
silence
what
to
hinder
your
coming
too
everybody
goes
there
you
know
wo
you
come
but
would
it
be
altogether
safe
he
reflected
doubtfully
why
of
course
taine
louise
and
jim
we
are
all
going
together
do
you
see
i
do
believe
you
want
to
go
she
pouted
i
believe
you
want
to
forget
her
alluring
manner
the
invitation
conveyed
in
her
words
and
voice
the
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
the
nearness
of
her
person
fairly
swept
the
man
off
his
feet
with
quick
passion
he
caught
her
hand
and
his
words
came
with
reckless
heat
you
know
that
i
will
not
forget
you
you
know
that
i
could
not
if
i
would
do
you
think
that
i
have
been
so
engrossed
with
my
brushes
and
canvas
that
i
have
been
unconscious
of
you
what
is
that
painted
thing
beside
your
own
beautiful
self
do
you
think
that
because
i
must
turn
myself
into
a
machine
to
make
a
photograph
of
your
beauty
i
am
insensible
to
its
charm
i
am
not
a
machine
i
am
a
man
as
you
are
a
woman
and
i
she
checked
him
suddenly
stepping
aside
with
a
quick
movement
and
the
words
hush
some
one
is
coming
the
artist
too
heard
voices
just
without
the
door
taine
moved
swiftly
across
the
room
toward
her
wrap
aaron
king
going
to
his
easel
drew
the
velvet
curtain
to
hide
the
picture
chapter
ix
conrad
lagrange
adventure
certainly
when
conrad
lagrange
fled
so
precipitately
from
louise
taine
that
afternoon
he
had
no
thought
that
the
trivial
incident
was
to
mark
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
his
life
or
that
it
would
work
out
in
the
life
of
his
dearest
friend
such
far
reaching
results
his
only
purpose
was
to
escape
an
hour
of
the
frothy
vaporings
of
the
poor
young
creature
who
believed
herself
so
interested
in
art
and
letters
and
who
succeeded
so
admirably
in
expressing
the
spirit
of
her
environment
and
training
with
his
pipe
and
book
the
novelist
hid
himself
in
the
rose
garden
finding
a
seat
on
the
ground
in
an
angle
of
the
studio
wall
and
the
ragged
robin
hedge
where
any
one
entering
the
enclosure
would
be
least
likely
to
observe
him
czar
heartily
approving
of
his
master
action
stretched
himself
comfortably
under
the
nearest
and
waited
further
developments
presently
the
novelist
heard
his
friend
with
taine
come
from
the
house
and
enter
the
studio
for
a
moment
he
entertained
the
uncomfortable
fear
that
the
artist
in
a
spirit
of
sheer
boyish
fun
that
so
often
moved
him
would
bring
taine
to
the
garden
but
the
moment
passed
and
the
novelist
mentally
blessing
the
young
man
for
his
forbearance
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
lighted
his
pipe
and
opened
his
book
scarcely
had
he
found
his
place
in
the
pages
however
when
he
was
again
interrupted
this
time
by
the
welcome
tones
of
their
neighbor
violin
putting
his
book
aside
the
man
reclining
in
the
shelter
of
the
roses
with
eyes
yielded
himself
to
the
fancy
of
the
spirit
that
called
from
the
depths
of
the
fragrant
orange
grove
the
mass
of
roses
in
the
hedge
and
on
the
wall
of
the
studio
above
his
head
dropped
their
lovely
petals
down
upon
him
the
warm
slanting
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
softened
by
the
screen
of
shining
leaves
and
branches
played
over
the
bewildering
riot
of
color
here
and
there
bees
and
butterflies
flitted
about
their
duties
far
above
in
the
deep
blue
a
hawk
floated
on
motionless
wings
and
a
lonely
crow
laid
his
course
toward
the
distant
mountain
peaks
that
gleamed
silvery
white
above
the
blue
and
purple
of
the
lower
ridges
and
the
tawny
yellow
of
their
foothills
the
air
was
saturated
with
the
fragrance
of
the
rose
and
orange
blossoms
of
eucalyptus
and
pepper
trees
and
with
the
thousand
other
perfumes
of
a
california
spring
the
music
ceased
the
man
waited
hoping
that
it
would
begin
again
but
it
did
not
and
he
was
about
to
take
up
his
book
once
more
when
czar
arose
stretched
himself
stood
for
a
moment
in
a
picturesque
listening
attitude
then
trotted
off
among
the
roses
leaving
the
novelist
with
an
odd
feeling
of
uneasy
expectancy
half
resolved
to
stay
half
determined
to
go
the
thought
of
louise
in
the
house
decided
him
and
he
kept
his
place
hidden
as
he
was
in
the
corner
a
whimsical
smile
hovering
over
his
features
as
though
after
all
he
felt
himself
entering
upon
some
enjoyable
adventure
presently
he
heard
indistinctly
somewhere
in
the
other
end
of
the
garden
a
low
murmuring
voice
as
it
came
nearer
the
man
smile
grew
more
pronounced
it
was
a
wonderfully
attractive
voice
clear
and
full
in
its
sweetness
the
unseen
speaker
was
talking
to
the
dog
the
smile
on
the
man
face
was
still
more
pronounced
as
he
whispered
to
himself
the
rascal
so
this
is
what
he
has
been
up
to
rising
quietly
to
his
knees
he
peered
through
the
bushes
a
young
woman
of
rare
and
exquisite
beauty
was
moving
about
the
garden
bending
over
the
roses
and
talking
in
low
tones
to
czar
who
to
his
hidden
master
appeared
to
appreciate
fully
the
favor
of
his
gentle
companion
intimacy
the
novelist
old
in
the
study
of
character
and
trained
by
his
long
years
of
observation
and
experience
in
the
world
of
artificiality
was
fascinated
by
the
loveliness
of
the
scene
dressed
simply
in
some
soft
clinging
material
of
white
with
a
modestly
square
at
the
throat
and
sleeves
that
ended
in
filmy
lace
just
below
the
elbow
her
lithe
softly
rounded
form
as
she
moved
here
and
there
had
all
the
charm
of
girlish
grace
with
the
fuller
beauty
of
ripening
womanhood
as
she
bent
over
the
roses
or
stooped
to
caress
the
dog
in
gentle
comradeship
her
step
her
poise
her
every
motion
was
instinct
with
that
strength
and
health
that
is
seldom
seen
among
those
who
wear
the
shackles
of
a
too
conventionalized
society
her
face
warmly
tinted
by
the
golden
firm
fleshed
and
clear
in
its
unconscious
naturalness
and
in
its
winsome
purity
was
like
the
flowers
she
stooped
to
kiss
as
he
watched
the
man
noticed
with
a
smile
of
understanding
that
she
kept
rather
to
the
side
of
the
garden
toward
the
house
where
the
artist
at
his
easel
by
the
big
north
light
could
not
see
her
through
the
small
window
in
the
end
of
the
room
and
where
hidden
by
the
tall
hedge
she
would
not
be
noticed
from
yee
kee
kitchen
often
too
she
paused
to
listen
as
if
for
any
chance
approaching
step
appearing
to
the
fancy
of
the
man
as
some
creature
from
another
world
poised
lightly
ready
to
vanish
if
any
rude
observer
came
too
near
soon
after
a
cautious
hesitating
listening
look
about
she
slipped
swift
footed
as
a
fawn
across
the
garden
and
followed
by
the
dog
disappeared
into
the
latticed
arbor
against
the
southern
wall
with
a
chuckle
to
himself
conrad
lagrange
crept
quietly
along
the
hedge
to
the
door
of
her
retreat
when
she
saw
him
there
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
started
as
though
to
escape
but
the
novelist
smiling
barred
her
way
while
czar
joyfully
greeting
his
master
turned
from
the
man
to
the
girl
and
back
to
the
man
again
as
if
by
dividing
his
attention
equally
between
the
two
he
was
bent
upon
assuring
each
that
the
other
was
a
friend
of
the
right
sort
there
was
no
mistaking
the
facts
that
the
dog
was
introducing
them
and
that
he
was
as
proud
of
his
new
acquaintance
as
he
was
pleased
to
present
his
older
and
more
intimate
companion
a
sunny
smile
broke
over
the
girl
winsome
face
as
she
caught
the
meaning
of
czar
behavior
o
she
said
are
you
his
master
her
manner
was
as
natural
and
unrestrained
as
a
child
her
voice
musically
sweet
and
low
as
one
unaccustomed
to
the
speech
of
noisy
crowded
cities
or
shrill
chattering
crowds
i
am
his
most
faithful
and
humble
subject
returned
the
man
whimsically
she
was
studying
his
face
openly
while
her
own
countenance
unschooled
to
hide
emotions
untrained
to
deceive
frankly
betrayed
each
passing
thought
and
mood
the
daintily
turned
chin
sensitive
lips
delicate
nostrils
and
large
blue
eyes
with
that
wide
unafraid
look
of
a
child
that
has
never
been
taught
to
fear
revealed
a
spirit
fine
and
rare
while
the
low
broad
forehead
shaded
by
a
wealth
of
soft
brown
hair
that
arranged
deftly
in
some
simple
fashion
seemed
to
invite
the
caress
of
every
wayward
breath
of
air
gave
the
added
charm
of
strength
and
purpose
the
man
seeing
these
things
and
knowing
as
few
men
ever
know
their
value
waited
her
verdict
it
came
with
a
smile
and
a
pretty
fancy
as
though
she
caught
the
mood
of
the
novelist
reply
he
has
told
me
so
much
about
you
how
kind
you
are
to
him
and
how
he
loves
you
i
hope
you
do
mind
that
he
and
i
have
learned
to
be
good
friends
wo
you
tell
me
his
name
i
have
tried
everything
but
nothing
seems
to
fit
to
call
such
a
royal
fellow
does
do
at
all
does
it
conrad
lagrange
laughed
and
it
was
the
laugh
of
a
conrad
lagrange
unknown
to
the
world
no
he
said
with
mock
seriousness
does
do
at
all
he
not
that
kind
of
a
dog
his
name
is
czar
that
is
he
added
giving
full
rein
to
his
droll
humor
i
gave
it
to
him
for
a
name
he
has
made
it
his
title
he
did
that
you
know
so
i
would
always
remember
that
he
is
my
superior
she
laughed
low
and
clear
as
a
girl
who
has
not
sadly
learned
that
she
is
a
woman
laughs
then
she
fell
to
caressing
the
dog
and
calling
him
by
name
while
czar
in
his
efforts
to
express
his
delight
and
satisfaction
was
as
nearly
undignified
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
as
he
watched
them
the
rugged
features
of
the
famous
novelist
were
lighted
with
an
expression
that
transformed
them
and
i
suppose
she
said
still
responding
to
the
novelist
playful
mood
that
czar
told
you
i
was
trespassing
in
your
garden
of
course
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
i
hope
he
told
you
also
that
i
do
not
steal
your
roses
the
man
shook
his
head
and
his
sharp
eyes
were
twinkling
merrily
now
as
a
boy
in
the
spirit
of
some
amusing
venture
oh
no
czar
said
nothing
at
all
about
trespassers
he
did
tell
me
though
about
a
wonderful
creature
that
comes
every
day
to
visit
the
garden
a
nymph
he
thought
it
was
a
beautiful
oread
from
away
up
there
among
the
silver
peaks
and
purple
canyons
or
perhaps
a
lovely
dryad
from
among
the
oaks
and
pines
i
felt
quite
sure
though
that
the
nymph
must
be
an
oread
because
he
said
that
she
comes
to
gather
colors
from
the
roses
and
that
every
morning
and
every
evening
she
uses
these
colors
to
tint
the
highest
peaks
and
crests
of
her
mountains
making
them
so
beautiful
that
mortals
would
always
begin
and
end
each
day
by
looking
up
at
them
of
course
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
knew
who
you
were
unaffectedly
pleased
as
a
child
at
his
quaint
fancy
she
answered
merrily
and
so
you
hid
among
the
roses
to
trap
me
i
suppose
indeed
i
did
not
he
retorted
indignantly
i
was
forced
to
fly
from
a
wicked
flibbertigibbet
who
seeks
to
torment
me
i
barely
escaped
with
my
life
and
came
into
the
garden
to
hide
and
recover
from
my
fright
then
i
heard
the
most
wonderful
music
and
guessed
that
you
must
be
somewhere
around
then
czar
who
had
come
with
me
to
hide
from
the
flibbertigibbet
in
the
house
left
me
i
looked
to
see
where
he
had
gone
and
so
i
saw
sure
enough
that
it
was
you
all
my
life
you
know
i
have
wanted
to
catch
a
real
nymph
but
never
could
so
when
you
came
into
the
arbor
i
could
resist
trying
again
and
now
here
we
are
with
czar
to
say
it
is
all
right
at
his
fanciful
words
she
laughed
again
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
pleasure
then
with
grave
sweetness
she
said
wo
you
sit
down
please
and
let
me
explain
seriously
i
suppose
you
must
pretend
to
be
like
the
rest
of
us
he
returned
with
an
air
of
resignation
but
all
the
same
czar
and
i
know
you
are
not
when
they
were
seated
she
said
simply
my
name
is
sibyl
andres
this
place
used
to
be
my
home
my
mother
planted
this
garden
with
her
own
hands
many
of
these
roses
were
brought
from
our
home
in
the
mountains
where
i
was
born
and
where
i
lived
with
father
and
mother
until
five
years
ago
i
feel
still
as
though
the
old
place
in
the
hills
were
my
real
home
and
every
summer
when
nearly
every
one
goes
away
from
fairlands
and
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
do
myra
willard
and
i
go
up
there
for
as
long
as
we
can
you
see
i
teach
music
and
play
in
the
churches
miss
willard
taught
me
she
and
mother
are
the
only
teachers
i
have
ever
had
after
father
death
mother
and
myra
and
i
lived
here
for
two
years
then
mother
died
and
myra
and
i
moved
to
that
little
house
over
there
because
we
could
not
afford
to
keep
this
place
but
the
man
who
bought
it
gave
me
permission
to
care
for
the
garden
so
i
come
almost
every
day
through
that
little
gate
in
the
corner
of
the
hedge
there
to
tend
the
roses
since
you
men
moved
in
though
i
come
mostly
in
the
morning
early
before
you
are
up
i
only
slip
in
sometimes
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
afternoon
when
i
think
it
will
be
safe
you
see
being
strangers
i
i
feared
you
would
think
me
bold
if
i
if
i
asked
to
come
so
many
people
really
would
understand
you
know
conrad
lagrange
deep
voice
was
very
gentle
as
he
said
king
and
i
have
known
all
the
time
that
we
had
no
real
claim
upon
this
garden
miss
andr√©s
then
with
his
whimsical
smile
he
added
you
see
we
felt
from
the
very
first
that
it
was
haunted
by
a
lovely
spirit
that
would
vanish
utterly
if
we
intruded
that
is
why
we
have
been
so
careful
we
did
not
want
to
frighten
you
away
and
besides
you
know
czar
told
us
that
it
was
all
right
the
blue
eyes
shone
through
a
bright
mist
as
she
answered
the
man
kindly
words
you
good
lagrange
and
all
the
time
it
was
really
of
whom
i
was
so
afraid
why
me
more
than
my
friend
he
asked
regarding
her
thoughtfully
she
colored
a
little
under
his
searching
gaze
but
answered
with
that
childlike
frankness
that
was
so
much
a
part
of
her
winsome
charm
why
because
your
friend
is
an
i
thought
would
be
sure
to
understand
i
knew
of
course
that
you
were
the
famous
author
everybody
talks
about
your
living
here
she
seemed
to
think
that
her
words
explained
you
mean
that
you
were
afraid
of
me
because
i
am
famous
he
asked
doubtfully
oh
no
she
answered
not
because
you
are
famous
i
mean
i
was
not
afraid
of
your
she
smiled
and
now
said
the
novelist
decisively
you
must
tell
me
at
once
do
you
read
my
books
he
waited
as
though
much
depended
upon
her
answer
the
blue
eyes
were
gazing
at
him
with
that
wide
unafraid
look
as
she
answered
sadly
no
sir
i
have
tried
but
i
ca
they
spoil
my
music
they
hurt
me
somehow
all
over
conrad
lagrange
received
her
words
with
mingled
emotions
with
pleased
delight
at
her
ingenuous
frankness
with
bitter
shame
sorrow
and
humiliation
and
at
the
last
with
genuine
gladness
and
relief
i
knew
it
he
said
triumphantly
i
knew
it
it
was
because
of
my
books
that
you
were
so
afraid
of
me
he
asked
eagerly
as
one
would
ask
to
have
a
deep
conviction
verified
you
see
she
said
smiling
at
the
manner
of
his
words
i
did
not
know
that
an
author
be
so
different
from
the
things
he
writes
about
then
with
a
puzzled
air
but
why
do
you
write
the
horrid
things
that
spoil
my
music
and
make
me
afraid
why
do
you
write
as
you
talk
about
about
the
mountains
why
do
you
make
books
like
like
she
seemed
to
be
searching
for
a
word
and
smiled
with
pleasure
when
she
found
it
like
yourself
listen
said
the
novelist
impressively
taking
refuge
in
his
fanciful
humor
listen
i
tell
you
a
secret
that
must
always
be
for
just
you
and
me
you
like
secrets
do
you
anxiously
she
laughed
with
pleasure
responding
instantly
to
his
mood
of
course
i
like
secrets
he
nodded
approval
i
was
sure
you
did
now
listen
i
am
not
really
conrad
lagrange
the
man
who
wrote
those
books
that
hurt
you
so
not
when
i
am
here
in
your
rose
garden
or
when
i
am
listening
to
your
music
or
when
i
am
away
up
there
in
your
mountains
you
know
it
is
only
when
i
am
in
the
unclean
world
that
reads
and
likes
my
books
that
i
am
the
man
who
wrote
them
her
eyes
shone
with
quick
understanding
of
course
she
agreed
you
be
kind
of
a
man
and
love
the
music
and
like
to
be
here
among
the
roses
or
up
in
the
mountains
could
you
no
and
i
tell
you
something
else
that
goes
with
our
secret
your
name
is
not
really
sibyl
andr√©s
you
know
any
more
than
you
really
live
over
there
in
that
little
house
your
real
home
is
in
the
mountains
just
as
you
said
you
live
among
the
glowing
peaks
under
the
dark
pines
on
the
ridges
and
in
the
purple
shadows
of
the
canyons
you
only
come
down
here
to
the
fairlands
folk
with
a
message
from
your
mountains
and
call
your
message
music
your
name
is
she
was
leaning
forward
her
face
glowing
with
eagerness
what
is
my
name
what
can
it
be
but
he
said
softly
that
it
and
you
who
are
you
when
you
are
not
when
you
are
not
in
that
other
world
me
oh
my
real
name
is
ca
you
guess
why
she
shook
her
head
tell
me
because
in
spite
of
all
that
the
world
that
reads
my
books
can
give
poor
old
can
not
be
happy
without
the
message
that
brings
from
her
mountains
and
you
too
love
the
mountains
and
and
this
garden
and
my
music
she
asked
half
doubtingly
you
are
not
pretending
that
too
just
to
amuse
me
no
i
am
not
pretending
that
he
said
then
why
how
can
you
do
the
the
other
thing
i
ca
understand
of
course
you
ca
understand
how
could
you
you
are
and
must
often
be
puzzled
by
the
things
that
does
yes
i
think
that
is
true
she
agreed
but
i
glad
you
like
my
music
anyway
and
so
am
i
glad
that
i
like
it
that
the
only
thing
that
saves
me
and
your
friend
the
artist
does
he
like
my
mountain
music
do
you
think
very
much
he
needs
it
too
i
am
glad
she
answered
simply
i
hoped
he
would
like
it
and
that
it
would
help
him
it
was
really
for
him
that
i
have
played
you
played
for
him
yes
she
returned
without
confusion
you
see
i
did
not
know
about
you
then
i
thought
you
were
altogether
the
man
who
wrote
those
books
and
so
i
not
play
for
you
that
is
i
mean
you
understand
i
could
not
play
again
she
seemed
to
search
for
a
word
and
finding
it
smiled
i
could
not
play
for
you
but
i
thought
that
because
he
was
an
he
would
understand
and
that
if
i
make
the
music
tell
him
of
the
mountains
it
would
perhaps
help
him
a
little
to
make
his
work
beautiful
and
right
do
you
see
yes
he
answered
smilingly
i
see
i
might
have
known
that
it
was
for
that
you
brought
your
message
from
the
hills
but
poor
old
is
frightfully
stupid
sometimes
you
know
laughingly
she
turned
to
the
lattice
wall
of
the
arbor
and
parting
the
screen
of
vines
a
little
said
to
him
look
here
standing
beside
her
conrad
lagrange
through
the
window
in
the
end
of
the
studio
next
the
garden
saw
aaron
king
at
his
easel
the
artist
position
in
the
light
of
the
big
north
window
being
in
a
direct
line
between
the
two
openings
and
the
arbor
taine
was
sitting
too
far
out
of
line
to
be
seen
the
girl
laughed
gleefully
do
you
see
him
at
his
work
at
first
i
only
hid
here
to
find
what
kind
of
people
were
going
to
live
in
my
old
home
but
when
he
was
making
our
old
barn
into
a
studio
and
i
heard
who
you
both
were
i
came
because
i
love
to
watch
him
as
i
try
to
make
the
music
i
think
he
would
love
to
hear
the
novelist
studied
her
intently
she
was
so
artless
so
unaffected
by
the
conventions
of
the
world
in
a
word
so
natural
in
expressing
her
thoughts
that
the
man
who
had
given
the
best
years
of
his
life
to
feed
the
vicious
grossly
sensual
and
bestial
imaginations
of
his
readers
was
deeply
moved
he
was
puzzled
what
to
say
at
last
he
murmured
haltingly
you
like
the
artist
then
her
eyes
were
full
of
curious
laughter
as
she
answered
why
what
a
funny
question
when
i
have
never
even
talked
with
him
how
i
like
any
one
i
have
never
known
but
you
make
your
music
for
him
and
you
come
here
to
watch
him
oh
but
that
is
for
the
work
he
is
doing
that
is
for
his
pictures
she
turned
to
look
through
the
tiny
opening
in
the
arbor
how
i
wish
i
could
see
inside
that
beautiful
room
i
know
it
must
be
beautiful
once
when
you
were
all
gone
i
tried
to
steal
in
but
of
course
he
keeps
it
locked
i
tell
you
what
we
do
said
the
man
suddenly
prompted
by
her
confession
to
resume
his
playful
mood
what
she
asked
eagerly
in
a
like
spirit
of
fun
first
he
answered
half
teasingly
i
must
know
if
you
could
now
make
your
music
for
me
as
well
as
for
him
for
the
you
that
loves
the
mountains
and
the
garden
i
sure
i
could
she
answered
promptly
well
then
if
you
will
promise
to
do
that
if
you
will
promise
not
to
play
for
just
him
alone
but
for
me
too
i
fix
it
so
that
you
can
go
into
the
studio
yonder
oh
i
will
always
play
for
you
too
anyway
now
that
i
know
you
of
course
he
said
we
could
just
walk
up
to
the
door
and
i
could
introduce
you
but
that
would
not
be
proper
for
would
it
she
shook
her
head
positively
i
would
like
to
do
that
he
would
think
i
was
intruding
i
am
sure
well
then
we
will
do
it
this
way
the
first
day
that
king
and
i
are
both
away
and
tee
kee
is
gone
too
i
slip
out
here
and
leave
a
letter
and
a
key
on
your
gate
the
letter
will
tell
you
just
the
time
when
we
go
and
when
we
will
return
so
you
will
know
whether
it
is
safe
for
you
or
not
and
how
long
you
can
stay
only
he
became
very
serious
only
you
must
promise
one
thing
what
that
you
wo
look
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
but
why
must
i
promise
that
because
that
picture
will
not
be
finished
for
a
long
time
yet
and
you
must
not
look
at
it
until
i
say
it
is
ready
king
would
like
you
to
see
that
picture
i
am
sure
in
fact
he
does
like
for
any
one
to
see
the
picture
he
is
working
on
just
now
how
funny
she
said
with
a
puzzled
look
what
is
he
painting
it
for
i
like
for
people
to
hear
my
music
the
man
answered
before
he
thought
but
i
do
like
people
to
read
my
books
she
shrank
back
with
troubled
eyes
oh
is
he
is
he
kind
of
an
artist
no
no
no
exclaimed
the
novelist
hastily
you
must
not
think
that
i
did
not
mean
you
to
think
that
if
he
was
kind
of
an
artist
i
would
let
you
go
into
the
studio
at
all
king
is
a
good
man
the
best
man
i
have
ever
known
he
is
my
friend
because
he
knows
the
secret
about
me
that
you
know
he
does
not
read
my
books
he
would
not
read
one
of
them
for
anything
it
is
only
that
this
picture
is
not
finished
when
it
is
finished
he
will
not
care
who
sees
it
i
glad
she
said
you
frightened
me
for
a
minute
i
understand
now
and
you
promise
not
to
look
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
she
nodded
of
course
and
when
i
come
out
i
lock
the
door
and
put
the
key
back
on
the
gate
again
and
no
one
but
you
and
i
will
ever
know
no
one
but
you
and
i
will
know
he
answered
as
he
spoke
czar
who
had
been
lying
quietly
in
the
doorway
of
the
arbor
rose
quickly
to
his
feet
with
a
low
growl
the
girl
peering
through
the
screen
on
the
side
toward
the
house
uttered
an
exclamation
of
fear
and
drew
back
turning
to
her
companion
appealingly
o
please
please
do
let
that
man
find
me
here
conrad
lagrauge
looked
and
saw
james
rutlidge
coming
down
the
path
toward
the
arched
entrance
to
the
garden
which
was
directly
across
from
the
arbor
stop
him
please
stop
him
whispered
the
girl
her
hand
upon
his
arm
stay
here
until
i
get
him
out
of
sight
said
the
novelist
quickly
i
wo
let
him
come
into
the
garden
when
we
are
gone
you
can
make
your
escape
do
forget
the
music
for
me
and
the
key
at
the
gate
he
spoke
to
czar
and
with
the
dog
obediently
at
heel
went
forward
to
meet
rutlidge
who
had
called
for
taine
and
louise
but
all
the
while
that
conrad
lagrange
was
talking
to
the
man
and
leading
him
toward
the
door
of
the
studio
he
was
wondering
why
that
look
of
fear
upon
the
face
of
the
girl
in
the
garden
what
had
sibyl
andr√©s
to
do
with
james
rutlidge
chapter
x
a
cry
in
the
night
as
conrad
lagrange
and
rutlidge
entered
the
studio
aaron
king
turned
from
the
easel
where
he
had
drawn
the
velvet
curtain
to
hide
the
finished
portrait
taine
was
standing
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
wrap
in
hand
calmly
waiting
ready
to
go
the
artist
greeted
rutlidge
cordially
while
the
woman
triumphantly
announced
the
completion
of
her
portrait
ah
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
old
man
said
rutlidge
addressing
the
artist
familiarly
it
is
too
much
i
suppose
to
expect
a
look
at
it
this
afternoon
thanks
returned
the
artist
you
are
all
coming
at
three
you
know
i
would
rather
not
show
it
it
is
a
little
late
for
the
best
light
and
i
would
like
for
to
see
it
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
possible
the
critic
was
visibly
flattered
by
the
painter
manner
and
by
his
emphasis
upon
the
personal
pronoun
quite
right
he
said
approvingly
quite
right
old
boy
he
turned
to
the
novelist
these
painter
chaps
you
know
lagrange
like
to
have
a
few
hours
for
a
last
touch
or
two
before
come
around
he
laughed
pompously
at
his
own
words
the
others
joining
when
taine
and
her
companions
were
gone
the
artist
said
hurriedly
to
his
friend
come
on
let
get
it
over
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
studio
i
thought
the
light
was
too
bad
said
the
older
man
quizzingly
as
they
entered
the
big
room
it
good
enough
for
needs
retorted
the
painter
savagely
you
could
see
all
you
want
by
he
jerked
the
curtain
angrily
aside
and
without
a
glance
at
the
canvas
walked
away
to
stand
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
rose
garden
waiting
for
the
flood
of
the
novelist
scorn
to
overwhelm
him
at
last
when
no
sound
broke
the
quiet
of
the
room
he
turned
to
find
himself
alone
conrad
lagrange
after
one
look
at
the
portrait
on
the
easel
had
slipped
quietly
out
of
the
building
the
artist
found
his
friend
a
few
minutes
later
meditatively
smoking
his
pipe
on
the
front
porch
with
czar
lying
at
his
feet
well
said
the
painter
curiously
anxious
as
he
had
said
to
have
it
over
why
the
deuce
do
you
something
the
novelist
answered
slowly
my
vocabulary
is
too
limited
for
one
reason
and
he
looked
thoughtfully
down
at
czar
i
prefer
to
wait
until
you
have
finished
the
portrait
it
finished
returned
the
artist
desperately
i
swear
i
never
touch
a
brush
to
the
damned
thing
again
the
man
with
the
pipe
spoke
to
the
dog
at
his
feet
listen
to
him
czar
listen
to
the
poor
devil
of
a
the
dog
arose
and
placing
his
head
upon
his
master
knee
looked
up
into
the
lined
and
rugged
face
as
the
novelist
continued
if
he
was
only
a
wee
bit
puffed
up
and
cocky
over
the
thing
now
we
could
exert
ourselves
so
we
could
could
we
czar
slowly
waved
a
feathery
tail
in
dignified
approval
his
master
continued
but
when
a
fellow
can
do
a
crime
like
that
and
still
retain
enough
virtue
in
his
heart
to
hear
his
work
shrieking
to
heaven
its
curses
upon
him
for
calling
it
into
existence
it
best
for
outsiders
to
keep
quite
still
your
poor
old
master
knows
whereof
he
speaks
does
he
dog
that
he
does
and
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
on
the
subject
demanded
the
artist
as
though
for
some
reason
he
was
disappointed
at
his
friend
reticence
i
add
a
word
of
advice
said
the
other
well
what
is
it
that
you
pray
your
gods
if
you
have
any
to
be
merciful
and
bestow
upon
you
either
less
genius
or
more
intelligence
to
appreciate
it
at
three
the
following
afternoon
the
little
party
from
fairlands
heights
came
to
view
the
portrait
or
as
conrad
lagrange
said
while
the
automobile
was
approaching
the
house
well
here
they
come
age
accompanied
by
and
to
look
upon
the
prostitution
of
art
and
call
it
good
escorted
by
the
artist
and
the
novelist
they
went
at
once
to
the
studio
the
appreciation
of
the
picture
was
instantaneous
so
instantaneous
in
fact
that
louise
taine
lips
were
shaped
to
deliver
an
expressive
oh
of
admiration
even
the
portrait
was
revealed
as
though
the
painter
in
drawing
back
the
easel
curtain
gave
an
appointed
signal
that
oh
was
set
off
with
the
suddenness
of
a
rush
and
was
accompanied
in
its
flight
by
a
great
volume
of
sizzling
sputtering
glittering
adjectival
sparks
that
filling
the
air
to
no
purpose
whatever
winked
out
as
they
were
born
the
climax
of
the
pyrotechnical
display
being
reached
in
the
explosive
pop
of
another
oh
which
released
a
brilliant
shower
of
variegated
sighs
and
moans
and
ecstatic
looks
and
inarticulate
exclamations
ending
of
course
in
total
darkness
taine
hastened
to
turn
the
artist
embarrassed
attention
to
an
appreciation
that
had
the
appearance
at
least
of
a
more
enduring
value
drawing
with
affectionate
solicitude
close
to
her
husband
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
was
tremulous
with
loving
care
and
anxiety
to
please
do
you
like
it
dear
it
is
magnificent
splendid
perfect
this
effort
to
give
his
praise
of
the
artist
work
the
appearance
of
substantial
reality
cost
the
wretched
product
of
lust
and
luxury
a
fit
of
coughing
that
racked
his
body
almost
to
its
last
feeble
hold
upon
the
world
of
flesh
and
with
a
force
that
shamed
the
strength
of
his
words
drove
home
the
truth
that
neither
his
praise
nor
his
scorn
could
long
endure
when
he
could
again
speak
he
said
in
his
husky
rasping
whisper
while
grasping
the
painter
hand
in
effusive
cordiality
my
dear
fellow
i
congratulate
you
it
is
exquisite
it
will
create
a
sensation
sir
when
it
is
exhibited
your
fame
is
assured
i
must
thank
you
for
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
thus
immortalizing
the
beauty
and
character
of
mrs
taine
and
then
to
his
wife
dearest
i
am
glad
for
you
and
proud
it
is
as
worthy
of
you
as
paint
and
canvas
could
be
he
turned
to
conrad
lagrange
who
was
an
interested
observer
of
the
scene
am
i
not
right
lagrange
quite
right
taine
quite
right
as
you
say
the
portrait
is
most
worthy
the
beauty
and
character
of
the
charming
subject
another
paroxysm
of
coughing
mercifully
prevented
the
poor
reply
with
one
accord
the
little
group
turned
now
to
james
rutlidge
the
dreaded
authority
and
arbiter
of
artistic
destinies
that
distinguished
expert
while
the
others
were
speaking
had
been
listening
intently
ostensibly
the
while
he
examined
the
picture
with
a
show
of
trained
skill
that
it
seemed
could
not
fail
to
detect
unerringly
those
more
subtle
values
and
defects
that
are
popularly
supposed
to
be
hidden
from
the
common
eye
silently
in
breathless
awe
they
watched
the
process
by
which
professional
criticism
finds
its
verdict
that
is
they
they
were
watching
the
process
in
reality
the
method
is
more
subtle
than
they
knew
while
the
great
critic
moved
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
easel
drew
away
from
or
bent
over
to
closely
scrutinize
the
canvas
shifted
the
easel
a
hair
breadth
several
times
sat
down
stood
erect
hummed
and
muttered
to
himself
abstractedly
cleared
his
throat
with
an
impressive
ahem
squinted
through
nearly
closed
eyes
with
his
head
thrown
back
or
turned
in
every
side
angle
his
fat
neck
would
permit
peered
through
his
fist
peeped
through
funnels
of
paper
sighted
over
and
under
his
open
hand
or
a
paper
held
to
shut
out
portions
of
the
painting
the
others
they
saw
him
expertly
weighing
the
evidence
for
and
against
the
merit
of
the
work
in
it
was
his
and
not
his
that
helped
the
critic
to
his
final
decision
a
decision
which
was
delivered
at
last
with
a
convincing
air
of
ponderous
finality
indeed
it
was
a
judgment
from
which
there
could
be
no
appeal
for
it
expressed
exactly
the
views
of
those
for
whose
benefit
it
was
rendered
then
in
a
manner
subtly
insinuating
himself
into
the
fellowship
of
the
famous
he
too
turned
to
conrad
lagrange
with
a
scholarly
do
you
not
agree
sir
the
novelist
answered
with
slow
impressiveness
the
picture
undoubtedly
fully
merits
the
appreciation
and
praise
you
have
given
it
i
have
already
congratulated
king
who
was
kind
enough
to
show
me
his
work
before
you
arrived
after
this
yee
kee
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
tea
was
served
in
the
studio
a
fitting
ceremony
to
the
launching
of
another
genius
by
the
way
lagrange
said
taine
quite
casually
when
under
the
influence
of
the
mildly
stimulating
beverage
the
talk
had
assumed
a
more
frivolous
vein
who
is
your
talented
neighbor
that
so
charms
king
with
the
music
of
a
violin
the
novelist
as
he
turned
toward
the
speaker
shot
a
quick
glance
at
the
artist
nor
did
those
keen
baffling
eyes
fail
to
note
that
at
the
question
james
rutlidge
had
paused
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
that
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
our
romantic
surroundings
madam
said
conrad
lagrange
easily
and
a
very
charming
mystery
it
seems
to
be
returned
the
woman
it
has
been
quite
affecting
to
watch
its
influence
upon
mr
king
the
artist
laughed
i
admit
that
i
found
the
music
in
combination
with
the
beauty
i
have
so
feebly
tried
to
out
upon
canvas
very
stimulating
a
flash
of
angry
color
swept
into
the
perfect
cheeks
of
taine
as
she
retorted
with
meaning
you
are
as
flattering
in
your
speech
as
you
are
with
your
brush
i
assure
you
i
do
not
consider
myself
in
your
unknown
musician
class
the
small
eyes
of
james
rutlidge
were
fixed
inquiringly
upon
the
speakers
while
his
heavy
face
betrayed
to
the
watchful
novelist
an
interest
he
could
not
hide
is
this
music
of
such
exceptional
merit
he
asked
with
an
attempt
at
indifference
louise
taine
sensing
that
the
performances
of
the
unnamed
violinist
had
been
acceptable
to
conrad
lagrange
and
aaron
king
the
two
representatives
of
the
world
to
which
she
aspired
could
not
let
the
opportunity
slip
she
fairly
deluged
them
with
the
spray
of
her
admiring
ejaculations
in
praise
of
the
musician
employing
hit
or
miss
every
musical
term
that
popped
into
her
vacuous
head
indeed
said
the
critic
i
seem
to
have
missed
a
treat
then
directly
to
the
artist
and
you
say
the
violinist
is
wholly
unknown
to
you
wholly
returned
the
painter
shortly
conrad
lagrange
saw
a
faint
smile
of
understanding
and
disbelief
flit
for
an
instant
over
the
heavy
face
of
james
rutlidge
when
the
automobile
at
last
was
departing
with
the
artist
guests
the
two
friends
stood
for
a
moment
watching
it
up
the
road
to
the
west
toward
town
as
the
big
car
moved
away
they
saw
taine
lean
forward
to
speak
to
the
chauffeur
while
james
rutlidge
who
was
in
the
front
seat
turned
and
shook
his
head
as
though
in
protest
the
woman
appeared
to
insist
the
machine
slowed
down
as
though
the
chauffeur
in
doubt
awaited
the
outcome
of
the
discussion
then
just
in
front
of
that
neighboring
house
rutlidge
seemed
to
yield
abruptly
and
the
automobile
turned
suddenly
in
toward
the
curb
and
stopped
taine
alighted
and
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
the
orange
grove
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
questioning
silence
the
artist
laughed
our
poor
little
mystery
he
said
but
the
novelist
as
they
went
toward
the
house
cursed
taine
james
rutlidge
and
all
their
kin
and
kind
with
a
vehement
earnestness
that
startled
his
companion
familiar
as
the
latter
was
with
his
peculiar
talent
in
the
art
of
vigorous
expression
after
dinner
that
evening
the
painter
and
the
novelist
sat
on
the
porch
as
their
custom
was
to
watch
the
day
go
out
of
the
sky
and
the
night
come
over
valley
and
hill
and
mountain
until
above
the
highest
peaks
the
stars
of
god
looked
down
upon
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
towns
of
men
at
that
hour
too
it
was
the
custom
now
for
the
violinist
hidden
in
the
orange
grove
to
make
the
music
they
both
so
loved
in
the
music
that
night
there
was
a
feeling
that
to
them
was
new
a
vague
uncertain
halting
undertone
that
was
born
they
felt
of
fear
it
stirred
them
to
question
and
to
wonder
without
apparent
cause
or
reason
they
each
oddly
connected
the
troubled
tone
in
the
music
with
the
stopping
of
the
automobile
from
fairlands
heights
that
afternoon
at
the
gate
of
the
little
house
next
door
the
artist
because
of
taine
insistent
inquiry
about
the
to
him
unknown
musician
conrad
lagrange
because
of
the
manner
of
the
girl
in
the
garden
when
james
rutlidge
appeared
and
because
of
the
critic
interest
when
they
had
spoken
of
the
violinist
in
the
studio
but
neither
expressed
his
thought
to
the
other
presently
the
music
ceased
and
they
sat
for
an
hour
perhaps
in
silence
as
close
friends
may
do
exchanging
only
now
and
then
a
word
suddenly
they
were
startled
by
a
cry
in
the
still
darkness
of
the
night
from
the
mysterious
depths
of
the
orange
grove
the
sound
came
with
such
a
shock
that
the
two
men
for
the
moment
held
their
places
motionless
questioning
each
other
sharply
what
was
that
did
you
hear
as
though
they
doubted
almost
their
own
ears
the
cry
came
again
this
time
undoubtedly
from
that
neighboring
house
to
the
west
it
was
unmistakably
the
cry
of
a
woman
a
woman
in
fear
and
pain
they
leaped
to
their
feet
again
the
cry
came
from
the
black
depths
of
the
orange
grove
shuddering
horrible
in
an
agony
of
fear
the
two
men
sprang
from
the
porch
and
through
the
darkness
that
in
the
orange
grove
was
like
a
black
wall
ran
toward
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
came
the
dog
at
their
heels
breathless
they
broke
into
the
little
yard
in
front
of
the
tiny
house
lights
shone
in
the
windows
all
seemed
peaceful
and
still
czar
betrayed
no
uneasiness
going
to
the
front
door
they
knocked
there
was
no
answer
save
the
sound
of
some
one
moving
inside
again
the
artist
knocked
vigorously
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
stood
on
the
threshold
standing
a
little
to
one
side
the
men
saw
her
features
clearly
in
the
light
from
the
room
it
was
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
conrad
lagrange
was
first
to
command
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
we
live
in
the
house
next
door
we
thought
we
heard
a
cry
of
distress
may
we
offer
our
assistance
in
any
way
is
there
anything
we
can
do
thank
you
sir
you
are
very
kind
returned
the
woman
in
a
low
voice
but
it
is
nothing
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
and
the
voice
of
sibyl
andr√©s
who
stood
farther
back
in
the
room
where
the
artist
from
his
position
could
not
see
her
added
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
lagrange
but
it
is
really
nothing
we
are
so
sorry
you
were
disturbed
not
at
all
returned
the
men
as
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
drew
back
from
the
door
good
night
good
night
came
from
within
the
house
and
the
door
was
shut
chapter
xi
go
look
in
your
mirror
you
fool
as
the
taine
automobile
left
aaron
king
and
his
friend
that
afternoon
taine
spoke
to
the
chauffeur
you
may
stop
a
moment
at
the
next
house
henry
if
she
had
fired
a
gun
james
rutlidge
could
not
have
turned
with
a
more
startled
suddenness
what
in
thunder
do
you
want
there
he
demanded
shortly
i
want
to
stop
she
returned
calmly
but
i
must
get
down
town
at
once
he
protested
i
have
already
lost
the
best
part
of
the
afternoon
your
business
seems
to
have
become
important
very
suddenly
she
observed
sarcastically
i
have
something
to
do
besides
making
calls
with
you
he
retorted
go
on
henry
taine
spoke
sharply
really
jim
you
are
going
too
far
henry
turn
in
at
the
house
the
machine
moved
toward
the
curb
and
stopped
as
she
stepped
from
the
car
she
added
i
will
only
be
a
minute
jim
rutlidge
growled
an
inarticulate
curse
what
deviltry
do
you
suppose
she
is
up
to
now
rasped
taine
which
brought
from
his
daughter
the
usual
protest
o
papa
do
as
taine
approached
the
house
sibyl
andr√©s
busy
among
the
flowers
that
bordered
the
walk
heard
the
woman
step
and
stood
quietly
waiting
her
taine
face
was
perfect
in
its
expression
of
cordial
interest
with
just
enough
but
not
too
much
of
a
conscious
superiority
the
girl
countenance
was
lighted
by
an
expression
of
childlike
surprise
and
wonder
what
had
brought
this
leader
in
the
social
world
from
fairlands
heights
to
the
poor
little
house
in
the
orange
grove
so
far
down
the
hill
good
afternoon
said
the
caller
you
are
miss
andr√©s
are
you
not
yes
returned
the
girl
with
a
smile
wo
you
come
in
i
will
call
miss
willard
oh
thank
you
no
i
have
only
a
moment
my
friends
are
waiting
i
am
mrs
taine
yes
i
know
i
have
often
seen
you
passing
the
other
turned
abruptly
what
beautiful
flowers
are
they
lovely
agreed
sibyl
with
frank
pleasure
at
the
appreciation
let
me
give
you
a
bunch
swiftly
she
gathered
a
generous
armful
taine
protested
but
the
girl
presented
her
offering
with
such
grace
and
winsomeness
that
the
other
could
not
refuse
as
she
received
the
gift
the
perfect
features
of
the
woman
of
the
world
were
colored
by
a
blush
that
even
she
could
not
control
i
understand
miss
andr√©s
she
said
that
you
are
an
accomplished
violinist
i
teach
and
play
in
park
church
was
the
simple
answer
i
have
never
happened
to
hear
you
myself
said
taine
smoothly
but
my
friends
who
live
next
door
lagrange
and
king
have
told
me
about
you
oh
the
girl
voice
was
vaguely
troubled
while
the
other
watching
saw
the
blush
that
colored
her
warmly
tinted
cheeks
it
is
good
of
you
to
play
for
them
continued
the
woman
from
fairlands
heights
casually
you
must
enjoy
the
society
of
such
famous
men
very
much
there
are
a
great
many
people
you
know
who
would
envy
you
your
friendship
with
them
the
girl
replied
quickly
o
but
you
are
mistaken
i
am
not
acquainted
with
them
at
all
that
is
not
with
king
i
have
never
spoken
to
him
and
i
only
met
lagrange
for
a
few
minutes
by
accident
indeed
but
i
am
forgetting
the
purpose
of
my
call
and
my
friends
will
become
impatient
do
you
ever
play
for
private
entertainments
miss
andr√©s
for
say
a
dinner
or
a
reception
you
know
i
would
be
very
glad
for
such
an
engagement
taine
i
must
earn
what
i
can
with
my
music
and
there
are
not
enough
pupils
to
occupy
all
my
time
but
perhaps
you
should
hear
me
play
first
i
will
get
my
violin
taine
checked
her
oh
no
indeed
it
is
quite
unnecessary
my
dear
the
opinion
of
your
distinguished
neighbors
is
quite
enough
i
shall
keep
you
in
mind
for
some
future
occasion
i
just
wished
to
learn
if
you
would
accept
such
an
engagement
thanks
so
much
for
your
flowers
she
was
upon
the
point
of
turning
away
when
a
low
cry
from
the
nearby
porch
startled
them
both
turning
they
saw
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
standing
in
the
doorway
an
expression
of
mingled
wonder
love
and
supplication
upon
her
hideously
marred
features
as
they
looked
she
started
toward
them
impulsively
stretching
out
her
arms
as
though
the
gesture
was
an
involuntary
expression
of
some
deep
emotion
then
checked
herself
suddenly
as
though
in
doubt
sibyl
andr√©s
uttered
an
exclamation
why
myra
what
is
it
dear
taine
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
horror
saying
to
the
girl
in
a
low
hurried
voice
dear
me
how
dreadful
i
really
must
be
going
as
she
went
down
the
path
towards
the
street
the
woman
on
the
porch
again
stretched
out
her
arms
appealingly
then
as
sibyl
reached
her
side
the
poor
creature
clasped
the
girl
in
a
close
embrace
and
burst
into
bitter
tears
upon
the
return
of
the
taines
and
james
rutlidge
to
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
taine
retired
immediately
to
her
own
luxuriously
appointed
apartments
at
dinner
a
maid
brought
to
the
household
word
that
her
mistress
was
suffering
from
a
severe
headache
and
would
not
be
down
and
begged
that
she
might
not
be
disturbed
during
the
evening
alone
in
her
room
taine
her
headache
being
wholly
conventional
gave
herself
unreservedly
to
the
thoughts
that
she
could
not
under
the
eyes
of
others
entertain
without
restraint
she
was
seated
at
a
window
that
looked
down
upon
the
carefully
graded
levels
of
the
envying
fairlanders
and
across
the
wide
sweep
of
the
valley
below
to
the
mountains
which
from
that
lofty
point
of
vantage
could
be
seen
from
the
base
of
their
lowest
foothills
to
the
crests
of
their
highest
peaks
but
the
woman
who
lived
on
the
heights
of
fairlands
saw
neither
the
homes
of
their
neighbors
the
busy
valley
below
nor
the
mountains
that
lifted
so
far
above
them
all
her
thoughts
were
centered
upon
what
to
her
was
more
than
these
when
night
was
gathering
over
the
scene
her
maid
entered
softly
taine
dismissed
the
woman
with
a
word
telling
her
not
to
return
until
she
rang
leaving
the
window
after
drawing
the
shades
close
she
paced
the
now
lighted
room
in
troubled
uneasiness
of
mind
here
and
there
she
paused
to
touch
or
handle
some
familiar
object
a
photograph
in
a
silver
frame
a
book
on
the
carved
table
the
trifles
on
her
open
desk
or
an
ornamental
vase
on
the
mantle
then
moved
restlessly
away
to
continue
her
aimless
exercise
when
the
silence
was
rudely
broken
by
the
sound
of
a
knock
at
her
door
she
stood
still
a
look
of
anger
marring
the
beauty
of
her
features
the
knock
was
repeated
with
an
exclamation
of
impatient
annoyance
she
crossed
the
room
and
flung
open
the
door
without
leave
or
apology
her
husband
entered
and
as
he
did
so
was
seized
by
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
that
sent
him
reeling
gasping
and
breathless
to
the
nearest
chair
taine
stood
watching
her
husband
coldly
with
a
curious
speculative
expression
on
her
face
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
hide
when
his
torture
was
abated
for
the
time
leaving
him
exhausted
and
trembling
with
weakness
she
said
coldly
well
what
do
you
want
what
are
you
doing
here
the
man
lifted
his
pallid
haggard
face
and
with
a
yellow
hand
wiped
the
beads
of
clammy
sweat
from
his
forehead
while
his
eyes
leered
at
her
with
an
insane
light
the
woman
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
her
disgust
in
her
voice
there
was
no
hint
of
pity
did
marie
tell
you
that
i
wished
to
be
alone
of
course
he
jeered
in
his
rasping
whisper
that
why
i
came
he
gave
a
hideous
resemblance
to
a
laugh
which
ended
in
a
cough
and
again
he
drew
his
skinny
shaking
hand
across
his
damp
forehead
that
the
time
that
a
man
should
visit
his
wife
is
it
when
she
is
alone
or
he
grinned
mockingly
when
she
wishes
to
be
she
regarded
him
with
open
scorn
and
loathing
you
unclean
beast
will
you
take
yourself
out
of
my
room
he
gazed
at
her
as
a
malevolent
devil
might
gloat
over
a
soul
delivered
up
for
torture
not
until
i
choose
to
go
my
dear
illustration
well
what
do
you
want
what
are
you
doing
here
suddenly
changing
her
manner
she
smiled
with
deliberate
mocking
humor
while
he
watched
she
moved
leisurely
to
a
deep
couch
and
arranging
the
pillows
reclined
among
them
in
the
careless
abandonment
of
voluptuous
ease
and
physical
content
openly
ostentatiously
she
exhibited
herself
to
his
burning
gaze
in
various
graceful
poses
lifting
her
arms
above
her
head
to
adjust
a
cushion
more
to
her
liking
turning
and
stretching
her
beautiful
body
moving
her
limbs
with
sinuous
enjoyment
as
disregardful
of
his
presence
as
though
she
were
alone
at
last
she
spoke
in
cool
even
colorless
tones
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
you
want
the
wretched
victim
of
his
own
unbridled
sensuality
shook
with
inarticulate
rage
choking
and
coughing
he
writhed
in
his
chair
his
emaciated
limbs
twisted
grotesquely
his
sallow
face
bathed
in
perspiration
his
hands
opening
and
closing
his
bloodless
lips
curled
back
from
his
yellow
teeth
in
a
horrid
grin
of
impotent
fury
and
all
the
while
she
lay
watching
him
with
that
pitiless
mocking
smile
it
was
as
though
the
malevolent
devil
and
the
tortured
soul
had
suddenly
changed
places
when
the
man
could
speak
he
reviled
her
in
his
rasping
whisper
with
curses
that
it
seemed
must
blister
his
tongue
she
received
his
effort
with
jeering
laughter
and
taunting
words
moving
her
body
now
and
then
among
the
cushions
with
an
air
of
purely
physical
enjoyment
that
to
the
other
was
maddening
if
this
is
all
you
came
for
she
said
easily
might
have
spared
yourself
the
effort
do
you
think
controlling
himself
in
a
measure
he
returned
i
came
to
tell
you
that
your
intimacy
with
that
damned
painter
must
stop
her
eyes
narrowed
slightly
one
hand
hidden
in
the
cushions
clenched
until
her
rings
hurt
just
what
do
you
mean
by
my
intimacy
she
asked
evenly
you
know
what
i
mean
he
replied
coarsely
i
mean
what
intimacy
with
a
man
always
means
to
a
woman
like
you
the
only
meaning
that
a
creature
of
your
foul
mind
can
understand
she
retorted
smoothly
if
it
were
worth
while
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
would
say
that
my
conduct
when
alone
with
king
has
been
as
proper
as
as
when
i
am
alone
with
you
the
taunt
maddened
him
interrupted
by
spells
of
coughing
choking
gasping
fighting
for
breath
his
eyes
blazing
with
hatred
and
lust
mingling
his
words
with
oaths
and
curses
he
raged
at
her
and
do
you
think
that
because
i
am
so
nearly
dead
i
do
not
resent
what
i
saw
do
you
think
i
am
so
far
gone
that
i
can
not
understand
your
interest
in
this
man
after
watching
you
together
all
the
afternoon
has
there
been
any
one
in
his
studio
except
you
two
when
he
was
painting
you
in
that
dress
which
you
designed
for
his
benefit
oh
no
indeed
you
and
your
genius
could
not
be
interrupted
for
the
sake
of
his
art
his
art
great
god
was
there
ever
such
a
damnable
farce
since
hell
was
invented
art
you
crazed
with
jealous
fury
he
pointed
at
her
with
his
yellow
shaking
skeleton
fingers
and
struggled
to
raise
his
voice
above
that
rasping
whisper
until
the
cords
of
his
scrawny
neck
stood
out
and
his
face
was
distorted
with
the
strain
of
his
effort
painted
as
a
modest
quaker
maid
with
all
the
charm
of
innocence
virtue
and
religious
piety
in
your
face
and
that
picture
will
be
exhibited
and
written
about
as
a
work
of
you
pull
all
the
strings
and
use
all
your
influence
and
the
thing
will
be
received
as
a
masterpiece
and
she
added
calmly
you
will
write
a
check
and
lie
as
you
did
this
afternoon
without
heeding
her
remark
he
went
on
you
know
the
picture
is
worthless
he
knows
it
conrad
lagrange
knows
it
jim
rutlidge
knows
it
the
whole
damned
clique
and
gang
of
you
know
it
he
like
all
his
kind
a
pretender
a
poser
playing
into
the
hands
of
such
women
as
you
to
win
social
position
and
wealth
and
we
and
our
kind
we
pretend
to
believe
in
such
damned
parasites
and
exalt
them
and
what
we
call
their
art
and
keep
them
in
luxury
and
buy
their
pictures
because
they
prostitute
their
talents
to
gratify
our
vanity
we
know
it
all
a
damned
sham
and
a
pretense
that
if
they
were
real
artists
with
an
honest
workman
respect
for
their
work
they
would
recognize
us
do
forget
to
send
him
a
check
she
murmured
you
ca
afford
to
neglect
it
you
know
think
how
people
would
talk
do
worry
he
replied
there
be
no
talk
i
send
the
genius
his
check
for
making
love
to
my
wife
in
the
sacred
name
of
art
and
lie
about
his
picture
with
the
rest
of
you
but
there
will
be
no
more
of
your
intimacy
with
him
you
my
wife
in
spite
of
hell
and
from
now
on
i
see
that
you
are
true
to
me
your
sickening
pose
of
modesty
in
dress
shall
be
something
more
than
a
pose
for
the
little
time
i
have
left
i
have
you
to
myself
or
i
kill
you
his
reference
to
her
refusal
to
uncover
her
shoulders
in
public
broke
the
woman
calm
and
aroused
her
to
a
cold
fury
springing
to
her
feet
she
stood
over
him
as
he
sat
huddled
in
his
chair
exhausted
by
his
effort
what
is
your
silly
idle
threat
beside
the
fact
she
said
with
stinging
scorn
to
have
killed
me
instead
of
making
me
your
wife
would
have
been
a
kindness
greater
than
you
are
capable
of
you
know
how
unspeakably
vile
you
were
when
you
bought
me
you
know
how
every
hour
of
my
life
with
you
has
been
a
torment
to
me
you
should
be
grateful
that
i
have
helped
you
to
live
your
lie
that
i
have
played
the
game
of
respectability
with
you
that
i
am
willing
to
play
it
a
little
while
longer
until
you
lay
down
your
hand
for
good
and
release
us
both
suppose
i
what
you
think
me
what
right
have
to
object
to
my
pleasures
have
you
in
all
your
life
of
idle
vicious
luxury
have
you
ever
feared
to
do
evil
if
it
appealed
to
your
bestial
nature
you
know
you
have
not
you
have
feared
only
the
appearance
of
evil
to
be
as
evil
as
you
like
so
long
as
you
can
avoid
the
appearance
of
evil
that
the
game
you
have
taught
me
to
play
that
the
game
we
have
played
together
that
the
game
we
and
our
kind
insist
the
artists
and
writers
shall
help
us
play
that
the
only
game
i
know
and
by
the
rule
of
our
game
so
long
as
the
world
sees
nothing
i
shall
do
what
pleases
me
you
have
had
your
day
with
me
you
have
had
what
you
paid
for
what
right
have
you
to
deny
me
now
an
hour
forgetfulness
when
i
think
of
what
i
might
have
been
but
for
you
i
wonder
that
i
have
cared
to
live
and
i
would
not
except
for
the
poor
sport
of
torturing
you
you
scoff
at
king
portrait
of
me
because
he
has
not
painted
me
as
i
am
what
would
you
have
said
if
he
painted
me
as
i
am
what
would
you
say
if
conrad
lagrange
should
write
the
truth
about
us
and
our
kind
for
his
millions
of
readers
you
sneer
at
me
because
i
can
not
uncover
my
shoulders
in
the
conventional
dress
of
my
class
and
so
make
a
virtue
of
a
necessity
and
deceive
the
world
by
a
pretense
of
modesty
go
look
in
your
mirror
you
fool
your
right
to
sneer
at
me
for
my
poor
little
pretense
is
denied
you
by
every
line
of
your
repulsive
countenance
now
get
out
going
to
retire

she
rang
for
her
maid
chapter
xii
first
fruits
of
his
shame
when
the
postman
in
his
little
cart
stopped
at
the
home
of
aaron
king
and
his
friend
that
day
it
was
conrad
lagrange
who
received
the
mail
the
artist
was
in
his
studio
and
the
novelist
knowing
that
the
painter
was
not
at
work
went
to
him
there
with
a
letter
the
portrait
still
on
the
easel
was
hidden
by
the
velvet
curtain
sitting
by
a
table
that
was
littered
with
a
confusion
of
sketches
books
and
papers
the
young
man
was
a
package
of
old
letters
that
he
had
evidently
just
been
reading
as
the
novelist
went
to
him
the
artist
said
quietly
indicating
the
package
in
his
hand
from
my
mother
she
wrote
them
during
the
last
year
of
my
study
abroad
when
the
other
did
not
reply
he
continued
thoughtfully
do
you
know
lagrange
since
my
acquaintance
with
you
i
find
many
things
in
these
old
letters
that
at
the
time
i
received
them
i
did
not
at
all
appreciate
you
seem
to
be
helping
me
somehow
to
a
better
understanding
of
my
mother
spirit
and
mind
he
smiled
presently
conrad
lagrange
when
he
could
trust
himself
to
speak
said
your
mother
mind
and
spirit
aaron
were
too
fine
and
rare
to
be
fully
appreciated
or
understood
except
by
one
trained
in
the
school
of
life
itself
when
she
wrote
those
letters
you
were
a
student
of
mere
craftsmanship
she
herself
no
doubt
recognized
that
you
would
not
fully
comprehend
the
things
she
wrote
but
she
put
them
down
out
of
the
very
fullness
of
her
intellectual
and
spiritual
wealth
trusting
to
your
love
to
preserve
the
letters
and
to
the
years
to
give
you
understanding
why
cried
the
artist
those
are
almost
her
exact
words
as
i
have
just
been
reading
them
the
other
smiling
continued
quietly
your
appreciation
and
understanding
of
your
mother
will
continue
to
grow
through
all
your
life
aaron
when
you
are
old
as
old
as
i
am
you
will
still
find
in
those
letters
hidden
treasures
of
thought
and
truths
of
greater
value
than
you
now
can
realize
but
here
i
have
brought
you
your
share
of
the
afternoon
mail
when
aaron
king
opened
the
envelope
that
his
friend
laid
on
the
table
before
him
he
sat
regarding
its
contents
with
an
air
of
thoughtful
meditation
lost
to
his
surroundings
the
novelist
who
had
gone
to
the
window
and
was
looking
into
the
rose
garden
turned
to
speak
to
his
friend
but
the
other
did
not
reply
again
the
man
at
the
window
addressed
the
painter
but
still
the
younger
man
was
silent
at
this
conrad
lagrange
came
back
to
the
table
an
expression
of
anxiety
upon
his
face
what
is
it
old
man
what
the
matter
no
bad
news
i
hope
aaron
king
aroused
from
his
fit
of
abstraction
laughed
shortly
and
held
out
to
his
friend
the
letter
he
had
just
received
it
was
from
taine
enclosed
was
the
millionaire
check
the
letter
was
a
formal
business
note
the
check
was
for
an
amount
that
drew
a
low
whistle
from
the
novelist
lips
rather
higher
pay
than
old
brother
judas
received
for
a
somewhat
similar
service
is
it
he
commented
as
he
passed
the
letter
and
check
back
to
the
artist
then
as
he
watched
the
younger
man
face
he
asked
what
the
matter
do
you
like
the
flavor
of
these
first
fruits
of
your
shame
i
advise
you
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
this
sort
of
thing
as
quickly
as
possible
in
your
own
defense
do
you
think
you
are
a
little
bit
too
hard
on
us
all
lagrange
asked
the
artist
with
a
faint
smile
these
people
are
satisfied
the
picture
pleases
them
of
course
they
are
pleased
retorted
the
other
you
know
your
business
that
the
trouble
with
you
that
the
trouble
with
us
all
these
days
we
painters
and
writers
and
musicians
we
know
our
business
too
damned
well
we
have
the
mechanics
of
our
crafts
the
tricks
of
our
trades
so
well
in
hand
that
we
make
our
books
and
pictures
and
music
say
what
we
please
we
our
art
to
gain
our
own
vain
ends
instead
of
being
driven
our
art
to
find
adequate
expression
for
some
great
truth
that
demands
through
us
a
hearing
you
have
said
it
all
my
friend
you
have
summed
up
the
whole
situation
in
the
world
of
creative
art
these
people
are
satisfied
you
have
given
them
what
they
want
prostituting
your
art
to
do
it
that
what
i
have
been
doing
all
these
years
giving
people
what
they
want
for
a
price
we
cater
to
them
even
as
their
tailors
and
milliners
and
barbers
and
never
again
will
the
world
have
a
truly
great
art
or
literature
until
men
like
us
in
the
divine
selfishness
of
their
calling
demand
first
and
last
that
they
be
satisfied
by
the
work
of
their
hands
going
to
the
easel
he
rudely
jerked
aside
the
curtain
involuntarily
the
painter
went
to
stand
by
his
side
before
the
picture
look
at
it
cried
the
novelist
look
at
it
in
the
light
of
your
own
genius
do
you
see
its
power
does
it
tell
you
what
you
do
if
you
would
if
you
could
paint
a
picture
or
if
you
could
feel
a
picture
to
be
painted
it
would
matter
i
let
you
ride
to
hell
on
your
own
palette
and
be
damned
to
you
but
this
thing
shows
a
power
that
the
world
can
ill
afford
to
lose
it
is
so
bad
because
it
is
so
good
come
here
he
drew
his
friend
to
the
big
window
and
pointed
to
the
mountains
there
is
an
art
like
those
mountains
my
boy
lonely
apart
from
the
world
remotely
above
the
squalid
ambitions
of
men
godlike
in
its
calm
strength
and
peace
an
art
to
which
men
may
look
for
inspiration
and
courage
and
hope
and
there
is
an
art
that
is
like
fairlands
petty
and
shallow
and
mean
with
only
the
fictitious
value
that
its
devotees
assume
but
never
actually
realize
listen
aaron
do
continue
to
misread
your
mother
letters
do
misunderstand
her
as
thinking
that
the
place
she
coveted
for
you
is
a
place
within
the
power
of
these
people
to
give
come
with
me
into
the
mountains
yonder
come
and
let
us
see
if
in
those
hills
of
god
you
can
not
find
yourself
when
conrad
lagrange
finished
the
artist
stood
for
a
little
without
reply
irresolute
before
his
picture
the
check
in
his
hand
at
last
still
without
speaking
he
went
back
to
the
table
where
he
wrote
briefly
his
reply
to
taine
when
he
had
finished
he
handed
his
letter
to
the
older
man
who
read
dear
sir
in
reply
to
yours
of
the
enclosing
your
check
in
payment
for
the
portrait
of
taine
i
appreciate
your
generosity
but
can
not
now
accept
it
i
find
upon
further
consideration
that
the
portrait
does
not
fully
satisfy
me
i
shall
therefore
keep
the
canvas
until
i
can
with
the
consent
of
my
own
mind
put
my
signature
upon
it
herewith
i
am
returning
your
check
for
of
course
i
can
not
accept
payment
for
an
unfinished
work
in
a
day
or
two
lagrange
and
i
will
start
to
the
mountains
for
an
outing
trusting
that
you
and
your
family
will
enjoy
the
season
at
lake
silence
i
am
with
kind
regards
yours
sincerely
aaron
king
that
evening
the
two
men
talked
over
their
proposed
trip
and
laid
their
plans
to
start
without
delay
as
conrad
lagrange
put
it
they
would
lose
themselves
in
the
hills
with
no
definite
destination
in
view
and
no
set
date
for
their
return
also
he
stipulated
that
they
should
travel
light
with
only
a
pack
burro
to
carry
their
supplies
and
that
they
should
avoid
the
haunts
of
the
summer
resorters
and
keep
to
the
more
unfrequented
trails
the
novelist
acquaintance
with
the
country
into
which
they
would
go
and
his
experience
in
woodcraft
gained
upon
many
like
expeditions
in
the
lonely
wilds
he
loved
would
make
a
guide
unnecessary
it
would
be
a
new
experience
for
aaron
king
and
as
the
novelist
talked
he
found
himself
eager
as
a
schoolboy
for
the
trip
while
the
distant
mountains
themselves
seemed
to
call
him
inviting
him
to
learn
the
secret
of
their
calm
strength
and
the
spirit
of
their
lofty
peace
the
following
day
they
would
spend
in
town
purchasing
an
outfit
of
the
necessary
equipment
and
supplies
securing
a
burro
and
attending
to
numerous
odds
and
ends
of
business
preparatory
to
their
indefinite
absence
it
so
happened
the
next
day
that
yee
kee
who
was
to
care
for
the
place
during
their
weeks
of
absence
had
matters
of
importance
to
himself
that
demanded
his
attention
in
town
when
his
masters
informed
him
that
they
would
not
be
home
for
lunch
he
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
asked
for
the
day
thus
it
came
about
that
conrad
lagrange
in
the
spirit
of
a
boy
bent
upon
some
secret
adventure
stole
out
into
the
rose
garden
that
morning
to
leave
the
promised
letter
and
key
at
the
little
gate
in
the
corner
of
the
ragged
robin
hedge
chapter
xiii
myra
willard
challenge
since
her
meeting
with
conrad
lagrange
in
the
rose
garden
sibyl
andr√©s
had
looked
every
day
for
that
promised
letter
she
found
it
early
in
the
afternoon
it
was
a
quaint
letter
written
in
the
spirit
of
their
meeting
telling
her
the
probable
time
of
her
neighbor
return
warning
her
in
fear
of
some
fanciful
horror
to
beware
of
the
picture
on
the
easel
and
wishing
her
joy
of
the
adventure
with
the
note
was
a
key
a
few
minutes
later
the
girl
unlocked
the
door
of
the
studio
and
entered
the
building
that
had
once
been
so
familiar
to
her
but
was
now
in
its
interior
so
transformed
slowly
she
pushed
the
door
to
behind
her
as
though
half
frightened
at
her
own
daring
she
stood
quite
still
looking
about
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
somewhat
richly
furnished
apartment
poised
timidly
as
if
for
ready
flight
she
seemed
indeed
the
spirit
that
the
novelist
in
playful
fancy
insisted
that
she
was
her
cheeks
were
glowing
with
color
her
eyes
were
bright
with
the
excitement
of
her
innocent
adventure
and
with
her
genuine
admiration
and
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
room
presently
growing
bolder
she
began
moving
about
the
studio
and
graceful
as
a
wild
thing
from
her
own
mountain
home
and
indeed
with
much
the
air
of
a
gentle
creature
of
the
woods
that
had
strayed
into
the
haunts
of
men
intensely
interested
in
the
things
she
found
she
gradually
forgot
her
timidity
and
gave
herself
to
the
enjoyment
of
her
surroundings
with
the
freedom
and
abandon
of
a
child
from
picture
to
picture
she
went
with
wide
eager
eyes
she
turned
over
the
sketches
in
the
big
portfolios
that
were
so
invitingly
open
looked
with
awe
upon
the
brushes
stuck
in
the
big
chinese
jar
upon
the
palettes
and
at
the
tubes
of
color
flitting
to
the
window
that
looked
out
upon
her
garden
and
back
to
the
great
north
light
with
its
view
of
the
distant
mountains
and
again
and
again
paused
to
stand
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
in
front
of
the
big
easel
with
its
canvas
hidden
under
the
velvet
curtain
then
she
must
try
the
chairs
the
oriental
couch
and
even
the
stool
where
she
had
seen
the
artist
sitting
sometimes
at
his
work
when
she
had
watched
him
from
the
arbor
and
last
in
a
pretty
make
believe
she
tried
the
seat
on
the
model
throne
as
though
posing
herself
for
her
portrait
suddenly
with
a
startled
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
then
shrank
back
white
and
trembling
her
big
eyes
fixed
with
pleading
fear
upon
the
man
who
stood
in
the
open
doorway
regarding
her
with
a
curious
triumphant
smile
it
was
james
rutlidge
sibyl
occupied
with
her
childlike
delight
had
failed
to
hear
the
automobile
when
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
finding
no
one
in
the
house
the
man
had
gone
on
to
the
studio
where
with
the
assurance
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
he
had
pushed
open
the
door
that
was
standing
ajar
at
the
girl
frightened
manner
the
man
laughed
closing
the
door
he
said
with
an
insinuating
sneer
you
were
not
expecting
me
it
seems
his
words
aroused
sibyl
from
her
momentary
weakness
rising
she
said
calmly
i
was
not
expecting
any
one
mr
rutlidge
again
he
laughed
with
unpleasant
meaning
you
certainly
look
to
be
very
much
at
home
he
moved
confidently
to
the
easel
stool
and
seating
himself
continued
with
a
leering
smile
what
the
matter
with
my
taking
the
artist
place
for
a
little
while
at
least
until
he
comes
the
girl
was
too
innocent
to
understand
his
assumption
but
her
pure
mind
could
not
fail
to
sense
the
evil
in
his
words
i
had
permission
to
come
here
this
afternoon
she
said
her
voice
trembling
a
little
with
the
fear
that
she
did
not
understand
wo
you
go
please
neither
king
nor
lagrange
are
at
home
i
do
not
doubt
your
having
permission
to
come
here
he
returned
with
meaning
stress
upon
the
word
permission
i
see
you
even
carry
a
key
to
this
really
delightful
room
he
motioned
with
his
head
toward
the
door
where
he
had
seen
the
key
in
the
lock
as
she
had
left
it
at
this
she
grasped
a
hint
of
the
man
thought
and
for
an
instant
drew
hack
in
shame
then
suddenly
with
a
burst
of
indignant
anger
she
took
a
step
toward
him
demanding
clearly
are
you
saying
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
coming
here
to
meet
mr
king
he
laughed
mockingly
really
my
dear
no
one
seeing
you
now
could
blame
the
man
for
giving
you
a
key
to
this
place
where
he
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
undisturbed
king
is
neither
such
a
virtuous
saint
nor
so
engrossed
in
his
art
as
to
resent
the
companionship
of
such
a
vision
of
loveliness
simply
because
it
comes
in
the
form
of
good
flesh
and
blood
why
be
angry
with
me
her
cheeks
were
crimson
as
she
said
again
will
you
go
not
until
you
have
settled
the
terms
of
peace
he
answered
with
that
leering
smile
fortune
has
favored
me
this
afternoon
and
i
mean
to
profit
by
it
for
an
instant
she
looked
at
him
frightened
and
dismayed
suddenly
with
the
quickness
that
was
a
part
of
her
physical
inheritance
from
her
mountain
life
she
darted
past
him
eluding
his
effort
to
detain
her
and
was
out
of
the
building
with
an
oath
the
man
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
ran
after
her
outside
the
door
of
the
studio
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
white
dress
as
she
disappeared
into
the
rose
garden
in
the
garden
he
saw
her
as
she
slipped
through
the
little
gate
in
the
far
corner
of
the
hedge
into
the
orange
grove
recklessly
he
followed
among
the
trees
he
glimpsed
again
the
white
flash
of
her
skirts
and
dashed
forward
at
the
farther
edge
of
the
grove
that
walled
in
the
little
yard
where
sibyl
lived
he
saw
her
standing
by
the
kitchen
door
but
between
the
girl
and
that
last
row
of
trees
waiting
his
coming
stood
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
rutlidge
paused
angry
with
himself
for
so
foolishly
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
his
passion
myra
willard
went
toward
him
fearlessly
her
fine
eyes
blazing
with
righteous
indignation
what
are
you
trying
to
do
james
rutlidge
she
demanded
and
her
words
were
bold
and
clear
the
man
was
silent
you
are
evidently
a
worthy
son
of
your
father
the
woman
continued
every
word
biting
into
his
consciousness
with
stinging
scorn
he
in
his
day
did
all
he
knew
to
turn
this
world
into
a
hell
for
those
who
were
unfortunate
enough
to
please
his
vile
fancy
you
i
see
are
following
faithfully
his
footsteps
i
know
you
and
the
creed
of
your
kind
as
i
knew
your
father
before
you
no
girl
of
innocent
beauty
is
safe
from
you
your
unclean
mind
is
as
incapable
of
believing
in
virtue
as
you
are
helpless
in
the
grip
of
your
own
insane
lust
the
man
was
stung
to
fury
by
her
cutting
words
take
your
ugly
face
out
of
my
sight
he
said
brutally
fearlessly
she
drew
a
step
nearer
it
is
because
i
am
a
woman
that
i
have
this
ugly
face
james
rutlidge
she
touched
her
disfigured
cheek
these
scars
are
the
marks
of
the
beast
that
rules
you
sir
body
and
soul
leave
this
place
or
as
there
is
a
god
i
tell
a
tale
that
will
forbid
you
ever
showing
your
own
evil
countenance
in
public
again
something
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
manner
as
she
spoke
caused
the
man
beside
himself
with
rage
as
he
was
to
draw
back
some
mysterious
force
that
made
itself
felt
in
her
bold
words
told
him
that
hers
was
no
idle
threat
a
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
in
the
edge
of
the
shadowy
orange
grove
the
man
of
the
world
prominent
in
circles
of
art
and
culture
and
the
woman
whose
natural
loveliness
was
so
distorted
into
a
hideous
mask
of
ugliness
with
a
short
derisive
laugh
james
rutlidge
turned
and
walked
away
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
were
returning
from
town
as
they
neared
their
home
they
saw
one
of
the
taine
automobiles
in
front
of
the
house
company
said
the
artist
with
a
smile
thinking
of
his
letter
to
the
millionaire
it
rutlidge
said
the
novelist
noting
the
absence
of
the
chauffeur
they
were
turning
in
at
the
entrance
when
czar
who
had
dashed
ahead
as
if
to
investigate
halted
suddenly
with
a
low
growl
of
disapproval
huh
ejaculated
conrad
lagrange
with
his
twisted
grin
it
senior
all
right
look
at
czar
he
knows
the
beast
is
around
go
fetch
him
czar
with
an
angry
bark
the
dog
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
porch
the
two
men
following
were
met
by
rutlidge
who
had
made
his
way
back
through
the
grove
and
the
rose
garden
from
the
house
next
door
the
dog
with
muttering
growls
was
sniffing
suspiciously
at
his
heels
czar
said
his
master
suggestively
with
a
meaning
glance
the
dog
reluctantly
ceased
his
embarrassing
attentions
and
went
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
about
the
premises
in
answer
to
their
greeting
and
the
quite
natural
question
if
he
had
been
waiting
long
rutlidge
answered
with
a
laugh
oh
no
i
have
been
amusing
myself
by
prowling
around
your
place
snug
quarters
you
have
here
really
i
never
quite
appreciated
their
charm
before
they
seated
themselves
on
the
porch
conrad
lagrange
thinking
of
sibyl
andr√©s
and
that
letter
which
he
had
left
on
the
gate
from
under
his
brows
watched
their
caller
closely
the
while
he
filled
with
painstaking
care
his
brier
pipe
we
like
it
returned
the
artist
i
should
think
so
i
be
sorry
to
leave
it
if
i
were
you
taine
tells
me
you
are
going
to
the
mountains
we
not
giving
up
this
place
though
replied
aaron
king
yee
kee
stays
to
take
care
of
things
until
our
return
oh
i
see
i
generally
go
into
the
mountains
myself
for
a
little
hunt
when
the
deer
season
opens
it
may
be
that
i
will
run
across
you
somewhere
by
the
way
you
have
met
your
musical
neighbor
yet
have
you
the
novelist
gave
particular
attention
to
his
pipe
which
did
not
seem
to
be
behaving
properly
the
artist
answered
shortly
no
i
certainly
make
her
acquaintance
if
i
were
you
said
rutlidge
with
his
suggestive
smile
she
is
a
dream
a
delightful
little
retreat
that
studio
of
yours
the
painter
puzzled
by
the
man
words
and
by
his
insinuating
air
returned
coldly
it
does
very
well
for
a
the
other
laughed
meaningly
yes
oh
yes
a
great
little
i
suppose
you
ah
do
not
fear
to
trust
your
to
the
chinaman
during
your
absence
conrad
lagrange
certain
now
that
the
man
had
seen
sibyl
andr√©s
either
entering
or
leaving
the
studio
said
abruptly
you
need
give
yourself
no
concern
for
king
studio
rutlidge
i
can
assure
you
that
the
treasures
there
will
be
well
protected
james
rutlidge
understood
the
warning
conveyed
in
the
novelist
words
that
to
aaron
king
revealed
nothing
really
said
the
painter
to
their
caller
you
are
not
uneasy
for
the
safety
of
taine
portrait
are
you
old
man
if
you
are
of
course
damn
taine
portrait
ejaculated
the
man
rising
hurriedly
you
know
what
i
mean
it
all
right
of
course
i
must
be
going
hope
you
have
a
good
outing
and
come
back
to
find
all
your
art
treasures
safe
he
laughed
coarsely
as
he
went
down
the
walk
when
the
automobile
was
gone
the
artist
turned
to
his
friend
now
what
in
thunder
did
he
mean
by
that
what
the
matter
with
him
do
you
suppose
they
imagine
that
there
is
anything
wrong
because
i
would
turn
over
the
picture
he
is
an
unclean
beast
aaron
the
novelist
answered
shortly
his
father
was
the
worst
i
ever
knew
and
he
like
him
forget
him
here
comes
the
delivery
boy
with
our
stuff

overhaul
the
outfit
i
hope

burro
before

where
we
put
him
in
the
studio
heh
look
here
said
the
artist
a
few
minutes
later
returning
from
a
visit
to
the
studio
for
something
this
is
what
was
the
matter
with
rutlidge
and
you
did
it
old
man
this
is
your
key
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
other
in
confusion
taking
the
key
why
i
found
the
studio
door
wide
open
with
your
key
in
the
lock
you
must
have
been
out
there
just
before
we
left
this
morning
and
forgot
to
shut
the
door
rutlidge
probably
noticed
it
when
he
was
prowling
about
the
place
and
was
trying
to
roast
me
for
my
carelessness
conrad
lagrange
stared
stupidly
at
the
key
in
his
hand
well
i
damned
he
muttered
then
added
in
savage
and
as
it
seemed
to
the
artist
exaggerated
wrath
i
a
stupid
blundering
irresponsible
old
fool
nor
was
he
consoled
when
the
painter
innocently
assured
him
that
no
harm
had
resulted
from
his
carelessness
that
night
as
the
two
men
sat
on
the
porch
watching
the
last
of
the
light
on
the
mountain
tops
they
heard
again
the
cry
of
fear
and
pain
that
came
from
the
little
house
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
orange
grove
wonderingly
they
listened
once
more
it
came
filled
with
shuddering
terror
when
the
sound
was
not
repeated
conrad
lagrange
thoughtfully
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
poor
soul
he
said
those
scars
did
more
than
disfigure
her
beautiful
face
i
wager
there
a
sad
story
there
aaron
it
strange
how
i
am
haunted
by
the
impression
that
i
ought
to
know
her
but
i
ca
make
it
come
clear
heigho
he
added
a
moment
later
as
if
to
free
his
mind
from
unpleasant
thoughts
i
be
glad
when
we
are
safely
up
in
the
hills
yonder
do
you
know
old
man
i
feel
as
though
getting
away
just
in
the
nick
of
time
my
back
hair
and
the
pricking
of
my
thumbs
warn
me
that
your
dearly
beloved
spooks
are
combining
to
put
up
some
sort
of
a
spooking
job
on
us
i
hope
yee
kee
has
a
plentiful
supply
of
to
stand
off
if
they
get
too
busy
while
we
are
gone
aaron
king
laughed
quietly
in
the
dusk
as
he
returned
and
i
have
a
presentiment
that
those
precious
members
of
our
household
are
preparing
to
accompany
us
to
the
hills
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
something
is
going
to
happen
up
there
he
pointed
to
the
distant
mountains
then
added
to
me
at
least
i
feel
as
though
i
were
about
to
bid
myself
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
hope
that
donkey
of
ours
is
a
psychic
donkey
or
if
he
is
that
he
listen
to
reason
and
be
content
with
his
escorts
of
flesh
and
blood
as
he
finished
speaking
the
quiet
of
the
evening
was
broken
by
a
lusty
in
front
of
the
house
there
i
told
you
so
ejaculated
the
painter
laughing
the
two
men
followed
czar
down
the
walk
in
the
dark
to
receive
the
shaggy
companion
for
their
wanderings
as
many
a
man
has
done
aaron
king
had
spoken
in
jest
more
truth
than
he
knew
chapter
xiv
in
the
mountains
in
the
gray
of
the
early
morning
hours
before
the
dwellers
on
fairlands
heights
thought
of
leaving
their
beds
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
made
ready
for
their
going
the
burro
croesus
so
named
by
the
novelist
because
as
the
famous
writer
explained
that
ancient
you
know
really
was
an
ass
was
to
be
entrusted
with
all
the
available
worldly
possessions
of
the
little
party
an
arrangement
the
more
experienced
man
carefully
pointed
out
that
considering
the
chief
characteristics
of
croesus
was
quite
in
accord
with
the
customs
of
modern
pilgrimages
conrad
lagrange
himself
skillfully
fixed
the
pack
in
place
adjusting
the
saddle
with
careful
hand
accurately
dividing
the
weight
with
the
blankets
on
top
and
over
all
the
canvas
tarpaulin
folded
the
proper
size
and
neatly
tucked
in
around
the
ends
and
finally
securing
the
whole
with
the
to
the
uninitiated
intricate
and
complicated
diamond
hitch
the
order
of
their
march
also
would
place
croesus
first
which
position
the
novelist
again
gravely
explained
as
he
drew
the
cinches
tight
is
held
by
all
who
value
good
form
to
be
the
donkey
proper
place
in
the
procession
as
he
watched
his
friend
the
artist
felt
that
indeed
he
was
about
to
go
far
from
the
ways
of
life
that
he
had
always
known
when
all
was
ready
the
two
men
dressed
in
flannels
corduroys
and
mountain
boots
called
to
yee
kee
respectfully
invited
croesus
to
proceed
and
set
out
with
czar
the
fourth
member
of
the
party
flying
here
and
there
in
such
a
whirlwind
of
good
spirits
that
not
a
shred
of
his
usual
dignity
was
left
the
sun
was
still
below
the
mountain
crest
though
the
higher
points
were
gilded
with
its
light
when
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
city
made
by
men
and
set
their
faces
toward
the
hills
that
bore
in
every
ridge
and
peak
and
cliff
and
crag
and
canyon
the
signature
of
god
as
conrad
lagrange
said
they
might
have
hired
a
wagon
or
even
an
automobile
to
take
them
and
their
goods
to
some
mountain
ranch
where
they
would
have
had
no
trouble
in
securing
a
burro
for
their
wanderings
a
team
would
have
made
the
trip
by
noon
a
machine
would
have
set
them
down
in
clear
creek
canyon
before
the
sun
could
climb
high
enough
to
look
over
the
canyon
walls
but
that
explained
the
novelist
as
they
trudged
leisurely
along
between
rows
of
palms
that
bordered
the
orange
groves
on
either
side
of
their
road
and
sensed
the
mystery
that
marks
the
birth
of
a
new
day
but
that
is
not
a
proper
way
to
go
to
the
mountains
the
mountains
he
continued
with
his
eyes
upon
the
distant
heights
are
not
seen
by
those
who
would
visit
them
with
a
rattle
and
clatter
and
rush
and
roar
as
one
would
visit
the
cities
of
men
they
are
to
be
seen
only
by
those
who
have
the
grace
to
go
quietly
who
have
the
understanding
to
go
thoughtfully
the
heart
to
go
lovingly
and
the
spirit
to
go
worshipfully
they
are
to
be
approached
not
in
the
manner
of
one
going
to
a
or
a
circus
but
in
the
mood
of
one
about
to
enter
a
great
cathedral
or
indeed
of
one
seeking
admittance
to
the
very
of
god
when
going
to
the
mountains
one
should
take
time
to
feel
them
drawing
near
they
are
never
intimate
with
those
who
hurry
mere
seldom
see
much
of
anything
if
possible
insisted
the
speaker
smiling
gravely
upon
his
companion
one
should
always
spend
at
least
a
full
day
in
the
approach
before
entering
the
immediate
presence
of
the
hills
one
should
first
view
them
from
a
distance
seeing
them
from
base
to
peak
in
the
glory
of
the
day
beginning
as
they
watch
the
world
awake
in
the
majesty
of
full
noon
as
they
maintain
their
calm
above
the
turmoil
of
the
day
doing
and
in
the
glory
of
the
sun
departure
as
it
lights
last
their
crests
and
peaks
and
then
after
such
a
day
one
should
sleep
one
night
at
their
feet
the
artist
listened
with
delight
as
he
always
did
when
his
friend
spoke
in
those
rare
moods
that
revealed
a
nature
so
unknown
to
the
world
that
had
made
him
famous
when
the
novelist
finished
the
young
man
said
gently
and
your
words
my
friend
are
almost
a
direct
quotation
from
that
anonymous
book
which
my
mother
so
loved
perhaps
they
are
aaron
admitted
conrad
lagrange
perhaps
they
are
so
it
was
that
they
spent
that
day
in
leisure
approach
the
patient
croesus
with
his
burden
always
in
the
lead
and
czar
like
a
merry
sprite
playing
here
and
there
several
times
they
stopped
to
rest
beside
the
road
while
provident
croesus
gathered
a
few
mouthfuls
of
grass
or
weeds
many
times
they
halted
to
enjoy
the
scene
that
changed
with
every
step
their
road
led
always
upward
with
a
gradual
easy
grade
and
by
noon
they
had
left
the
cultivated
section
of
the
lower
valley
for
the
higher
untilled
lands
the
dark
of
the
orange
and
the
lighter
shining
tints
of
the
lemon
groves
with
the
rich
tones
of
the
were
replaced
now
by
the
softer
grays
greens
yellows
and
browns
of
the
chaparral
the
air
was
no
longer
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
roses
and
but
came
to
their
nostrils
laden
with
the
pungent
odors
of
yerba
santa
and
greasewood
and
sage
looking
back
they
could
see
the
valley
marked
off
by
its
roads
into
many
squares
of
green
and
dotted
here
and
there
by
small
towns
and
cities
stretching
away
toward
the
western
ocean
until
it
was
lost
in
a
haze
out
of
which
the
distant
san
gabriels
beyond
cajon
pass
lifted
into
the
clear
sky
above
like
the
of
dreamland
rising
out
of
a
dream
sea
before
them
the
san
bernardinos
drew
ever
nearer
and
more
intimate
silently
inviting
them
patiently
with
a
world
old
patience
bidding
them
come
in
the
majestic
humbleness
of
their
lofty
spirit
offering
themselves
and
the
wealth
of
their
teaching
so
they
came
in
the
late
afternoon
to
that
spot
where
the
road
for
the
first
time
crosses
the
alder
and
cottonwood
bordered
stream
that
before
it
reaches
the
valley
is
drawn
from
its
natural
course
by
the
irrigation
flumes
and
pipes
the
sound
of
the
mountain
waters
leaping
down
their
way
reached
the
men
while
they
were
yet
some
distance
croesus
pointed
his
long
ears
forward
in
burro
anticipation
his
experience
telling
him
that
the
day
work
was
about
to
end
czar
was
already
ranging
along
the
side
of
the
creek
sending
a
colony
of
squirrels
scampering
to
the
tree
tops
and
a
bevy
of
quail
whirring
to
the
chaparral
in
frightened
flight
the
artist
greeted
the
waters
with
a
schoolboy
shout
of
gladness
conrad
lagrange
with
the
smile
and
the
voice
of
a
man
miraculously
recreated
said
quietly
this
is
the
place
where
we
stop
for
the
night
their
camp
was
a
simple
matter
croesus
asked
nothing
but
to
be
released
from
his
burden
being
quite
capable
of
caring
for
himself
a
wash
in
the
clear
cold
water
of
the
brook
a
simple
meal
prepared
by
conrad
lagrange
over
a
small
fire
made
of
sticks
gathered
by
the
artist
their
tarpaulin
and
blankets
spread
within
sound
of
the
music
of
the
stream
a
watching
of
the
sun
glorious
going
down
a
quiet
pipe
in
the
hush
of
the
mysterious
twilight
a
good
night
in
the
soft
darkness
when
the
myriad
stars
looked
down
upon
the
dull
red
glow
of
their
embers
with
the
guarding
spirit
of
the
mighty
hills
to
give
them
peace
and
they
lay
down
to
sleep
at
the
mountain
feet
there
is
no
sleeping
late
in
the
morning
when
one
sleeps
in
the
open
under
the
stars
after
breakfast
the
artist
received
another
lesson
in
packing
and
they
moved
on
toward
the
world
that
already
seemed
to
dwarf
that
other
world
which
they
had
left
by
one
day
walking
so
far
below
a
heavy
fog
rolling
in
from
the
ocean
in
the
night
submerged
the
valley
in
its
dull
gray
depths
leaving
to
the
eye
no
view
but
the
view
of
the
mountains
before
them
and
forcing
upon
the
artist
mind
the
weird
impression
that
the
life
he
had
always
known
was
a
fantastically
unreal
dream
and
now
as
they
approached
the
frowning
entrance
of
clear
creek
canyon
grew
more
and
more
clearly
defined
the
higher
peaks
appeared
to
draw
back
and
hide
themselves
behind
the
foothills
which
as
the
men
came
closer
under
their
immediate
slopes
and
walls
seemed
to
grow
magically
in
height
and
bulk
a
little
before
noon
they
were
in
the
rocky
vestibule
of
the
canyon
on
either
hand
the
walls
rose
almost
sheer
while
their
road
now
was
but
a
narrow
shelf
under
the
overhanging
cliffs
below
which
the
white
waters
of
the
stream
cold
from
the
snows
so
far
above
tumbled
impetuously
over
the
boulders
that
obstructed
their
way
filling
the
gorge
with
tumultuous
melody
soon
the
canyon
narrowed
to
less
than
a
stone
throw
in
width
the
walls
grew
more
grim
and
forbidding
in
their
rocky
nearness
and
then
they
came
to
that
point
where
on
either
side
great
cliffs
projecting
form
the
massive
rugged
portals
of
the
mountain
gate
first
seen
from
a
point
where
the
road
rounds
a
jutting
corner
on
the
extreme
right
the
projecting
cliffs
ahead
appear
as
a
blank
wall
of
rock
that
forbids
further
progress
but
as
the
men
moved
forward
the
road
swinging
more
toward
the
center
of
the
gorge
the
cliffs
seemed
to
draw
apart
and
through
the
way
thus
opened
they
saw
the
great
canyon
and
the
mountains
beyond
it
was
as
though
a
mighty
invisible
hand
rolled
silently
back
those
awful
doors
to
give
them
entrance
abruptly
upon
the
inner
side
of
the
narrow
passage
the
canyon
widens
to
many
times
the
width
of
the
outer
vestibule
and
the
road
crossing
the
creek
curves
to
the
left
so
that
looking
back
as
they
went
the
two
men
saw
the
mighty
doors
closing
again
behind
them
as
they
had
opened
to
let
them
in
it
was
as
though
that
spirit
sentinel
guarding
the
treasures
of
the
hills
had
jealously
barred
the
way
that
no
one
else
from
the
world
of
men
might
follow
aaron
king
stopped
drawing
a
deep
breath
and
removing
his
hat
he
turned
his
face
from
that
mountain
wall
upward
to
the
encircling
ridges
and
towering
peaks
he
had
indeed
come
far
from
the
world
that
he
had
always
known

watched
his

spoke
no

a
deep
narrow

some
fifteen

in
length

in
by

by
the
rugged
portals
of

formed
by
the
dividing

separates

above

again
draw

stopped

wishing
to
greet
the
mountaineer
official
whom
he
had
learned
to
know
on
his
former
trip
but
the
ranger
was
away
somewhere
riding
his
lonely
trails
and
they
did
not
tarry
just
above
the
station

left

lost
to

for
the
narrow
winding
path
that
they
must
follow

file
there
was
no
sign
of
human
life
for
three
weeks
they
knew
no

than

times
they
walked
under

was
thickly
carpeted
with

dead
brown
needles
and
the
air
was
redolent
with
the

trees

made
their
camps
at
night
feeding
their
blazing
fires
with
the
pitchy
knots

that
croesus
packed
many
a
lusty
trout
from
the
tumbling
icy
torrent
again
high
up
on
some
granite
ridge
or
peak
where
the
pines
were
twisted
and
battered
and
torn
by
the
warring
elements
they
looked
far
down
upon
the
rolling
sea
of
clouds
that
hid
the
world
below
or
in
the
shelter
of
some
mighty
cliff
built
their
fires
and
when
the
night
was
clear
saw
miles
away
and
below
the
thousands
of
twinkling
lights
of
the
world
they
had
left
behind
or
again
they
halted
in
some
forest
and
hill
encircled
glen
where
the
lush
grass
in
the
cienaga
grew
almost
as
high
as
croesus
back
and
the
lilies
even
higher
and
where
through
the
dark
green
brakes
the
timid
deer
come
down
to
drink
at
the
beginning
of
some
mountain
stream
at
last
their
wanderings
carried
them
close
under
the
snowy
heights
of
san
gorgonio
the
loftiest
of
all
the
peaks
that
night
they
camped
at
and
in
the
morning
leaving
croesus
and
the
outfit
while
it
was
still
dark
made
their
way
to
the
top
in
time
to
see
the
sun
come
up
from
under
the
edge
of
the
world
so
they
were
received
into
the
inner
life
of
the
mountains
so
the
spirit
that
dwells
in
that
unmarred
world
whispered
to
them
the
secrets
of
its
enduring
strength
and
lofty
peace
from
san
gorgonio
they
followed
the
trail
that
leads
down
to
upper
clear
creek
halting
one
night
at
burnt
pine
camp
on
laurel
creek
above
the
falls
then
leaving
the
laurel
trail
they
climbed
over
a
spur
of
the
main
range
and
so
down
the
steep
wall
of
the
gorge
to
lone
cabin
on
fern
creek
the
next
day
they
made
their
way
on
down
to
the
floor
of
the
main
canyon
five
miles
above
the
point
where
they
had
left
it
at
the
beginning
of
their
wanderings
crossing
the
canyon
at
the
clear

power
company
intake
they
took
the

trail
that
follows

to
the

two
thousand
feet
above

this
trail
is
cut
in
the
steep
side
of

overhanging
the
narrow
valley
below
nine
beautiful
miles
of
it
at
oak

where
a
government
trail
for
the
forest
ranger
zigzags
down
from
the
to
the
wagon
road
below
they
halted
conrad

explained
that
there
were
three
ways
back
to
the
world
they
had
left
nearly
a
month
before
the

to
the
reservoir
and
so
down
to
the
and
the
fairlands

the

trail
from

on
the

down
to

and
out
through

canyon
gates
the
way
they
had
come
but
objected
aaron
king
lazily
from
where
he
lay
under
a
on
the
mountainside
a
few
feet
above
the
trail
either
route
presupposes
our
wish
to
return
to
fairlands
the
novelist
laughed
listen
to
him
czar
he
said
to
the
dog
lying
at
his
feet
listen
to
that
he
does
want
to
go
back
to
fairlands
any
more
than
we
do
does
he
rising
czar
looked
at
his
master
a
moment
with
slow
waving
tail
then
turned
inquiringly
toward
the
artist
well
said
the
young
man
what
about
it
old
boy
which
trail
shall
we
take
or
shall
we
take
any
of
them
with
a
prodigious
yawn
as
though
to
indicate
that
he
wearied
of
their
foolish
indecision
czar
turned
with
a
low
woof
toward
the
fourth
member
of
the
company
who
was
browsing
along
the
edge
of
the
trail
whenever
czar
was
in
doubt
as
to
the
wants
of
his
human
companions
he
always
barked
at
the
burro
he
says
croesus
commented
the
artist

cried
the
older
man
with
another
laugh
let
put
it
up
to
the
financier
and
let
him
choose

said
the
artist
as
the
other
turned
toward
the
burro
do
be
hasty
the
occasion
calls
for
solemn
meditation
and
lofty
discourse
your
pardon
returned
the
novelist
is
so
i
will
orate
carefully
selecting
a
pebble
in
readiness
to
emphasize
his
remarks
he
addressed
the
shaggy
arbiter
of
their
fate
sir
croesus
thy
pack
is
lighter
by
many
meals
than
when
first
thou
didst
set
out
from
that
land
where
we
did
rescue
thee
from
the
hands
of
thy
tormenting
trader
but
thy
responsibilities
are
weightier
many
fold
upon
the
wisdom
of
thy
choice
now
great
issue
rests
thou
hast
thy
chance
o
illustrious
ass
to
recompense
the
world
this
day
for
the
many
evils
wrought
by
thy
odious
ancestor
and
by
all
his
kin
choose
now
the
way
thy
benefactors
feet
shall
go
and
see
to
it
croesus
that
thou
dost
choose
wisely
or
by
thy
ears
we
flay
thy
woolly
hide
and
hang
it
on
the
mountainside
a
warning
to
thy
kind
the
pebble
struck
that
part
of
the
burro
anatomy
at
which
it
was
aimed
the
dog
barked
and
croesus
with
an
indignant
jerk
of
his
head
and
a
flirt
of
his
tail
started
forward
at
the
fork
of
the
trail
he
paused
the
two
men
waited
with
breathless
interest
with
an
air
of
accepting
the
responsibility
placed
upon
him
the
burro
whirled
and
trotted
down
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
the
floor
of
the
canyon
below
laughing
the
men
followed
but
far
enough
in
the
rear
to
permit
their
leader
to
choose
his
own
way
when
they
should
reach
the
wagon
road
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
wall
without
an
instant
hesitation
croesus
turned
down
the
road
quickening
his
pace
almost
into
a
trot

ejaculated
the
novelist
he
acts
like
he
knew
where
he
was
going

taking
you
at
your
word
returned
the
artist
look
at
him
go
evidently
he
still
under
the
inspiration
of
your
oratory
the
burro
had
broken
into
a
ridiculous
little
gallop
that
caused
the
and
lashed
on
the
outside
of
the
pack
to
rattle
merrily
splashing
through
the
creek
he
disappeared
in
the
dark
shadow
of
a
thicket
of
alders
and
willows
where
the
road
crosses
a
tiny
rivulet
that
flows
from
a
spring
a
hundred
yards
above
climbing
out
of
this
gloomy
hollow
the
road
turns
sharply
to
the
left
and
the
men
hurried
on
to
overtake
their
guide
before
he
should
be
too
long
out
of
their
sight
just
at
the
top
of
the
little
rise
before
rounding
the
turn
they
stopped
a
few
feet
to
the
right
of
the
road
with
his
nose
at
an
old
gate
stood
croesus
nor
would
he
heed
czar
bark
commanding
him
to
go
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
an
old
and
long
neglected
apple
orchard
a
log
barn
and
the
wreck
of
a
house
with
the
fireplace
and
chimney
standing
stark
and
alone
told
the
story
the
place
was
one
of
those
old
ranches
purchased
by
the
power
company
for
the
water
rights
and
deserted
by

who
once
had
called

overgrown
with
weeds
led
somewhere
around
the
edge
of
the
orchard
and
were
lost
in
the
tangle
of
trees
and
brush
on
its
lower
side
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
in
laughing
surprise
the
burro
turning
his
head
gazed
at
them
over
his
shoulder
inquiringly
as
much
as
to
say
well
what
the
matter
now
why
do
you
come
along
when
in
doubt
ask
croesus
said
the
artist
gravely
conrad
lagrange
calmly
opened
the
gate
promptly
the
burro
trotted
ahead
following
the
ancient
tracks
he
led
them
around
the
lower
end
of
the
orchard
crossed
a
little
stream
and
turning
again
climbed
a
gentle
rise
of
open
grassy
land
behind
the
orchard
stopping
at
last
with
an
air
of
having
accomplished
his
purpose
in
a
beautiful
little
grove
of
sycamore
trees
that
bordered
a
small
cienaga
completely
hidden
by
the
old
orchard
from
the
road
in
front
and
backed
by
the
foot
of
the
mountain
spur
that
here
forms
the
northern
wall
of
the
little
valley
the
spot
commanded
a
magnificent
view
of
the
encircling
peaks
and
ridges
san
bernardino
was
almost
above
their
heads
to
the
east
were
the
more
rugged
walls
of
the
upper
and
narrower
end
of
the
canyon
in
their
front
the
beautiful
oak
knoll
with
the
dark
steeps
and
crest
of
the
galenas
against
the
sky
while
to
the
west
the
blue
peaks
of
the
far
san
gabriels
showed
above
the
lower
spurs
and
foothills
of
the
more
immediate
range
the
foreground
was
filled
in
by
the
gentle
slope
leading
down
to
the
tiny
stream
at
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
and
a
little
to
the
left
by
the
cienaga
rich
in
the
color
of
its
tall
marsh
grass
and
reeds
gemmed
with
brilliant
flowers
of
gold
and
scarlet
bordered
by
graceful
willows
and
screened
from
the
eye
of
the
chance
traveler
by
the
lattice
of
tangled
orchard
boughs
seated
in
the
shade
of
the
sycamores
on
the
little
knoll
the
two
friends
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
the
scene
and
the
charming
seclusion
of
the
lovely
retreat
while
croesus
stood
patiently
as
though
waiting
to
be
rewarded
for
his
virtue
by
the
removal
of
his
pack
even
czar
refrained
from
charging
here
and
there
and
lay
down
contentedly
at
their
feet
with
an
air
of
having
reached
at
last
the
place
they
had
been
seeking
a
few
days
later
found
them
established
in
a
comfortable
camp
with
tents
and
furniture
and
hammocks
and
books
and
the
delighted
yee
kee
to
take
care
of
them
it
had
been
easy
to
secure
permission
from
the
neighboring
rancher
who
leased
the
orchard
from
the
company
conrad
lagrange
with
the
man
and
his
big
mountain
wagon
had
made
a
trip
to
town
returning
the
next
day
with
yee
kee
and
the
outfit
he
brought
also
things
from
the
studio
for
the
artist
declared
that
he
would
no
longer
be
without
the
materials
of
his
art
the
first
day
after
the
camp
was
built
the
artist
declaring
that
he
would
settle
the
question
at
once
as
to
whether
yee
kee
could
cook
a
trout
as
skillfully
as
the
novelist
took
rod
and
flies
and
leaving
the
famous
author
in
a
hammock
with
czar
lying
near
set
out
up
the
canyon
for
perhaps
two
miles
the
painter
followed
the
creek
taking
here
and
there
from
clear
pool
or
swirling
eddy
a
fish
for
his
creel
and
pausing
often
as
he
went
to
enjoy
in
artist
fashion
the
beauties
of
the
ever
changing
landscape
the
afternoon
was
almost
gone
when
he
finally
turned
back
toward
camp
he
had
been
away
already
longer
than
he
intended
but
still
as
all
fishermen
will
understand
he
could
not
on
his
way
back
down
the
stream
refrain
from
casting
here
and
there
over
the
pools
that
tempted
him
the
sun
was
touching
the
crest
of
the
mountains
when
he
had
made
but
little
more
than
half
the
distance
of
his
return
he
had
just
sent
his
fly
skillfully
over
a
deep
pool
in
the
shadow
of
a
granite
boulder
for
what
he
determined
must
be
his
last
cast
when
startlingly
clear
and
sweet
came
the
tones
of
a
violin
a
master
trout
leaped
the
hand
of
the
unheeding
fisherman
felt
the
tug
as
the
leader
broke
giving
the
victorious
fish
no
thought
aaron
king
slowly
reeled
in
his
line
there
was
no
mistaking
the
pure
vibrant
tones
of
the
music
to
which
the
man
listened
with
amazed
delight
it
was
the
music
of
the
to
him
unknown
violinist
who
lived
hidden
in
the
orange
grove
next
door
to
his
studio
home
in
fairlands
chapter
xv
the
forest
ranger
story
perhaps
the
motive
that
in
fairlands
had
restrained
the
artist
from
seeking
to
know
his
neighbor
was
without
force
in
the
mountains
perhaps
it
was
that
in
the
unconventional
freedom
of
the
hills
the
man
obeyed
more
readily
his
impulse
aaron
king
did
not
stop
to
question
as
though
in
answer
to
the
call
of
that
spirit
which
spoke
in
the
tones
of
the
violin
he
moved
in
the
direction
from
which
the
music
came
climbing
out
of
the
bed
of
the
stream
to
the
bench
that
slopes
hack
a
quarter
of
a
mile
perhaps
to
the
foot
of
the
canyon
wall
he
found
himself
in
an
old
road
that
where
it
once
crossed
the
creek
had
been
destroyed
by
the
mountain
floods
wonderingly
he
followed
the
dimly
marked
track
that
led
through
the
chaparral
toward
a
thicket
of
cedars
from
beyond
which
the
music
seemed
to
come
where
the
road
curved
to
find
its
way
through
the
green
barrier
he
paused
the
musician
undoubtedly
now
was
just
beyond
still
acting
upon
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
cautiously
parted
the
boughs
and
peered
through
into
a
little
open
glade
that
was
closed
in
on
every
side
by
the
rank
growth
of
the
mountain
vegetation
by
the
thicket
of
dark
cedars
and
by
tangled
masses
of
wild
opposite
the
spot
where
he
stood
and
half
concealed
by
great
sycamore
trees
was
a
small
log
house
with
a
thread
of
blue
smoke
curling
lazily
from
the
chimney
the
place
was
another
of
those
old
ranches
that
had
been
purchased
by
the
power
company
and
permitted
to
go
back
to
the
wilderness
from
which
it
had
been
won
by
some
hardy
settler
the
little
plot
of
open
ground
well
sodded
with
firm
turf
and
by
roving
cattle
and
deer
had
evidently
been
at
one
time
the
front
yard
of
the
mountaineer
home
a
little
out
from
the
porch
and
in
full
view
of
the
artist
her
graceful
form
outlined
against
the
background
of
wild
roses
stood
sibyl
andr√©s
with
her
violin
as
the
girl
played
her
winsome
face
upturned
to
the
mountain
heights
and
her
body
lightly
poised
swaying
with
the
movement
of
her
arm
as
easily
as
a
willow
bough
she
appeared
to
the
man
hidden
in
the
cedars
as
some
beautiful
spirit
of
the
woods
and
hills
a
spirit
that
would
vanish
instantly
if
he
should
step
from
his
hiding
place
he
was
so
close
that
he
could
see
her
blue
eyes
wide
and
unmindful
of
her
surroundings
her
lips
curved
in
an
unconscious
smile
and
her
cheeks
flushed
with
emotion
under
their
warm
brown
tint
as
she
appeared
to
listen
for
the
music
that
she
in
turn
seemingly
with
no
effort
of
her
will
gave
forth
again
in
the
tones
of
the
instrument
under
her
chin
aaron
king
was
moved
by
the
beauty
of
the
picture
as
he
had
never
been
stirred
before
the
peculiar
charm
of
the
music
the
loveliness
of
the
girl
herself
the
setting
of
the
scene
in
the
little
glade
with
its
wild
roses
giant
sycamores
dark
cedars
and
encircling
mountain
walls
all
in
the
soft
mystery
of
the
twilight
beginning
and
withal
the
unexpectedness
of
the
vision
combined
to
make
an
impression
upon
the
artist
mind
that
would
endure
for
many
years
suddenly
as
he
watched
the
music
ceased
the
girl
lowered
her
violin
and
with
a
low
laugh
said
to
some
one
on
the
porch
concealed
from
the
painter
by
the
trunk
of
a
sycamore
o
myra
i
want
to
dance
i
ca
keep
still
i
so
glad
glad
to
be
home
again
to
see
old
berdo
and
back
and
all
the
rest
of
them
up
there
she
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
in
answer
to
a
welcome
from
the
hills
then
whirling
quickly
she
gave
the
violin
to
her
companion
on
the
porch
play
myra
please
dear
play
at
her
word
the
music
of
the
violin
began
again
coming
now
from
behind
the
trunk
of
the
sycamore
in
the
hands
of
the
unseen
musician
the
instrument
laughed
and
sang
a
song
of
joyous
abandonment
of
freedom
and
rejoicing
of
happiness
and
love
while
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
spirit
and
the
rhythm
of
the
melody
the
girl
danced
upon
the
firm
green
carpet
of
grass
here
and
there
to
and
fro
about
the
little
glade
shut
in
from
the
world
by
its
walls
of
living
green
she
tripped
and
whirled
in
unstudied
grace
lightly
as
if
winged
unconscious
as
the
wild
creatures
that
play
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
wayward
as
the
zephyr
that
trips
along
the
mountainside
it
was
a
spontaneous
expression
of
her
spiritual
and
physical
exaltation
and
was
as
natural
as
the
laughter
in
her
voice
or
the
flush
upon
her
cheeks
it
was
a
dance
that
was
like
no
dance
that
aaron
king
had
ever
seen
the
artist
watching
through
the
screen
of
cedar
boughs
beside
the
old
wagon
road
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
lest
the
beautiful
vision
should
vanish
forgot
his
position
forgot
what
he
was
doing
fascinated
by
the
scene
to
which
he
had
been
led
so
unexpectedly
by
the
music
he
had
so
often
heard
while
at
work
in
his
studio
he
was
unmindful
of
the
rude
part
he
was
playing
he
was
brought
suddenly
to
himself
by
a
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
as
he
straightened
the
hand
whirled
him
half
around
and
he
found
himself
looking
into
a
face
that
was
tanned
and
seamed
by
many
years
in
the
open
the
man
who
had
so
unceremoniously
commanded
the
artist
attention
stood
a
little
above
six
feet
in
height
and
was
of
that
lean
but
build
that
so
often
marks
the
mountain
bred
he
wore
no
coat
at
his
hip
a
heavy
colt
revolver
hung
in
its
worn
holster
from
a
full
loosely
buckled
cartridge
belt
upon
his
unbuttoned
vest
was
the
shield
of
the
united
states
forest
service
from
under
the
brim
of
his
slouch
hat
he
gazed
at
aaron
king
questioningly
in
angry
disapproval
instinctively
neither
of
the
men
spoke
a
word
would
have
been
heard
the
other
side
of
the
cedars
with
a
gesture
commanding
the
artist
to
follow
the
ranger
quietly
withdrew
along
the
wagon
road
toward
the
creek
when
they
were
at
a
distance
where
their
voices
would
not
reach
the
girl
in
the
glade
the
ranger
said
with
angry
abruptness
now
sir
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
who
you
are
and
what
you
mean
by
spying
upon
a
couple
of
women
like
that
the
other
could
not
conceal
his
embarrassment
i
do
blame
you
for
calling
me
to
account
he
said
if
it
were
me
if
our
positions
were
reversed
i
mean
i
should
kick
you
down
into
the
creek
there
the
cold
blue
eyes
that
had
been
measuring
the
painter
so
shrewdly
twinkled
with
a
hint
of
humor
you
look
like
a
gentleman
you
know
the
officer
said
as
if
excusing
himself
for
not
following
the
artist
suggestion
but
all
the
same
you
must
explain
who
are
you
that
part
is
easy
at
least
returned
the
other
though
the
circumstance
of
our
meeting
a
temptation
to
lie
which
would
do
you
no
good
and
might
lead
to
unpleasant
complications
retorted
the
ranger
sharply
the
man
under
question
still
embarrassed
laughed
shortly
as
he
returned
i
really
was
not
thinking
of
it
seriously
my
name
is
aaron
king
i
am
an
artist
you
are
oakley
i
suppose
the
officer
nodded
beginning
to
smile
yes
i
am
brian
oakley
the
artist
continued
a
month
ago
conrad
lagrange
and
i
came
into
the
mountains
for
an
outing
we
stopped
at
the
station
but
there
was
no
one
at
home
most
of
the
time
we
have
been
just
roaming
around
now
we
are
camped
down
there
back
of
that
old
apple
orchard
the
ranger
broke
into
a
laugh
oakley
was
visiting
friends
up
the
canyon
the
day
you
came
in
but
morton
told
me
i
crossed
your
trail
a
dozen
times
and
sighted
you
nearly
as
many
but
i
was
always
too
busy
to
go
to
you
i
knew
lagrange
did
need
any
attention
you
see
so
i
just
figured
on
meeting
up
with
you
somewhere
by
accident
like
about
meal
time
mebbe
he
laughed
again
the
accident
part
worked
out
all
right
he
paused
still
laughing
enjoying
the
artist
discomfiture
then
ended
with
a
curious
what
in
thunder
were
you
sneaking
around
in
the
brush
like
that
for
anyway
those
women
wo
bite
aaron
king
explained
how
he
had
heard
the
music
while
fishing
and
how
following
the
sound
he
had
acted
upon
an
impulse
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
unknown
musician
before
revealing
himself
and
then
in
his
interest
had
forgotten
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
spy
until
so
rudely
aroused
by
the
hand
of
the
ranger
brian
oakley
chuckled
if
acted
upon
impulse
when
i
first
saw
you
peeking
through
those
cedars
you
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
you
were
but
while
i
was
sneaking
up
on
you
i
noticed
your
with
your
creel
and
rod
and
figured
how
you
might
have
come
there
so
i
thought
i
would
go
a
little
slow
and
you
wear
rather
heavy
boots
too
said
the
artist
suggestively
then
more
at
ease
he
joined
in
the
laugh
at
himself
catch
any
fish
asked
the
ranger
lifting
the
cover
of
the
creel
whee
as
he
saw
the
contents
that
bully
and
i
hungry
as
a
she
wolf
too
been
in
the
saddle
since
sunup
without
a
bite
what
do
you
say
if
i
make
that
long
deferred
social
call
upon
you
and
lagrange
this
evening
i
say
good
oakley
returned
the
artist
heartily
i
guess
you
know
what
lagrange
will
say
you
bet
i
do
he
whistled
a
low
birdlike
note
in
answer
a
beautiful
chestnut
came
out
of
the
chaparral
where
it
had
not
been
seen
by
the
painter
we
going
max
said
the
officer
in
a
way
and
as
the
two
men
set
out
the
horse
followed
with
a
air
that
brought
a
word
of
admiring
comment
from
the
artist
that
aaron
king
had
won
the
approval
of
the
ranger
was
evidenced
by
the
mountaineer
inviting
himself
to
supper
the
camp
in
the
sycamores
the
fact
that
the
officer
considerately
told
conrad
lagrange
only
that
he
had
met
the
artist
with
his
creel
full
of
trout
and
so
had
been
tempted
to
accompany
him
won
the
enduring
gratitude
of
the
young
man
thus
the
circumstances
of
their
meeting
introduced
each
to
the
other
with
recommendations
of
peculiar
value
and
marked
the
beginning
of
a
genuine
and
lasting
friendship
but
while
out
of
delicate
regard
for
the
artist
feelings
he
refrained
from
relating
the
to
the
young
man
embarrassing
incident
brian
oakley
could
not
resist
making
at
every
opportunity
sly
references
to
their
meeting
for
the
painter
benefit
and
his
own
amusement
thus
it
happened
that
after
supper
as
they
sat
with
their
pipes
the
talk
turned
upon
sibyl
andr√©s
and
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
the
ranger
to
tease
the
artist
had
remarked
casually
after
complimenting
them
upon
the
location
of
their
camp
and
you
got
some
mighty
nice
neighbors
less
than
a
mile
above
too
neighbors
ejaculated
conrad
lagrange
in
a
tone
that
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
sentiment
in
the
matter
the
others
laughed
while
the
officer
said
oh
i
know
how
feel
you
think
you
do
want
anybody
poaching
on
your
preserves
you
up
here
in
the
hills
to
get
away
from
people
and
all
that
but
you
need
to
be
uneasy
you
wo
even
see
these
folks
unless
you
sneak
up
on
them
he
stole
a
look
at
the
artist
and
chuckled
maliciously
as
the
painter
covertly
shook
his
fist
at
him
you
may
them
though
which
would
probably
be
as
bad
retorted
the
novelist
gruffly
oh
i
do
know
returned
the
other
you
might
be
able
to
stand
it
i
do
reckon
you
would
object
to
a
little
music
now
and
then
would
you
music
i
mean
so
our
neighbors
are
musical
are
they
the
novelist
seemed
slightly
interested
sibyl
andr√©s
is
the
most
accomplished
violinist
i
have
ever
heard
said
the
ranger
and
i
have
always
lived
in
these
mountains
you
know
as
for
myra
willard
well
she
taught
sibyl
though
she
does
pretend
to
equal
her
now
conrad
lagrange
was
interested
now
in
earnest
he
turned
to
the
artist
eagerly
but
with
caution
do
you
suppose
it
could
be
our
neighbors
in
the
orange
grove
aaron
brian
oakley
watched
them
with
quiet
amusement
i
know
it
is
returned
the
artist
you
know
it
is
ejaculated
the
other
sure
i
heard
the
violin
this
afternoon
while
i
was
fishing
he
added
hastily
when
the
ranger
laughed
the
novelist
commented
savagely
seems
to
me
you
mighty
careful
about
keeping
your
news
to
yourself
this
brought
another
burst
of
merriment
from
the
mountaineer
when
the
two
men
had
explained
to
the
ranger
about
the
music
in
the
orange
grove
conrad
lagrange
related
how
they
had
first
heard
that
cry
in
the
night
and
how
when
they
had
gone
to
the
neighboring
house
they
had
seen
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
standing
in
the
doorway
it
was
miss
willard
who
cried
out
said
brian
oakley
quietly
she
dreams
sometimes
of
the
accident
or
whatever
it
was
that
left
her
with
those
scars
at
least
that
what
i
think
it
is
certainly
it
no
ordinary
dream
that
would
make
a
woman
cry
like
that
the
first
time
i
heard
her
the
first
time
that
she
ever
did
it
in
fact
she
and
sibyl
were
stopping
over
night
at
my
house
it
was
three
years
ago
jim
rutlidge
had
just
come
west
on
his
first
trip
and
was
up
in
the
hills
on
a
hunt
he
happened
along
about
sundown
and
when
he
stepped
into
the
room
and
myra
saw
him
i
thought
she
would
faint
he
looked
like
some
one
she
had
known
she
said
and
that
night
she
gave
that
horrible
cry
lord
but
it
threw
a
fright
into
me
my
wife
did
get
over
being
nervous
for
a
week
myra
explained
that
she
had
dreamed
but
that
all
she
would
say
i
figured
that
being
upset
by
rutlidge
reminding
her
of
some
one
she
had
known
started
her
mind
to
going
on
the
past
and
then
she
dreamed
of
whatever
it
was
that
gave
her
those
scars
you
have
known
miss
willard
a
long
time
have
you
brian
asked
conrad
lagrange
with
the
freedom
of
an
old
comrade
for
men
may
grow
closer
together
in
one
short
season
in
the
mountains
than
in
years
of
meeting
daily
in
the
city
i
known
her
ever
since
she
came
into
the
hills
that
was
the
year
sibyl
was
born
all
that
anybody
knows
is
what
has
happened
since
mother
even
a
month
before
she
died
told
me
that
myra
history
before
she
came
to
them
was
as
unknown
to
her
as
it
was
the
day
she
stopped
at
their
door
i
ca
get
over
the
feeling
that
i
ought
to
know
her
that
i
have
seen
her
somewhere
years
ago
said
the
novelist
by
way
of
explaining
his
interest
then
it
was
before
she
got
those
scars
returned
the
ranger
no
one
could
ever
forget
her
face
as
it
is
now
at
the
same
time
commented
the
artist
the
scars
would
prevent
your
identifying
her
if
she
received
them
after
you
had
known
her
all
the
same
said
conrad
lagrange
as
though
his
mind
was
bothered
by
his
inability
to
establish
some
incident
in
his
memory
i
place
her
yet
do
you
mind
brian
telling
us
what
you
know
of
her
why
not
at
all
returned
the
officer
the
story
is
anybody
property
its
being
so
well
known
is
probably
the
reason
you
did
hear
it
when
you
were
up
here
before
sibyl
father
and
mother
were
here
in
the
mountains
when
i
came
they
lived
up
there
at
the
old
place
where
myra
and
sibyl
are
camping
now
and
i
never
expect
to
meet
finer
people
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
for
twenty
years
i
knew
them
intimately
will
andr√©s
was
as
true
and
square
and
white
a
man
as
ever
lived
and
nelly
was
just
as
good
a
woman
as
he
was
a
man
they
and
my
wife
and
i
were
more
like
brothers
and
sisters
than
most
folks
who
are
actually
blood
kin
one
day
along
toward
sundown
about
a
month
before
sibyl
was
born
nelly
heard
the
dogs
barking
and
went
to
see
what
was
up
there
stood
myra
willard
at
the
gate
like
she
dropped
out
of
the
sky
where
she
came
from
god
only
knows
except
that
she
walked
from
some
station
on
the
railroad
over
toward
the
pass
she
was
just
about
all
in
and
of
course
nelly
had
her
into
the
house
and
was
fixing
her
up
in
no
time
she
wanted
to
work
but
admitted
that
she
had
never
done
much
housework
she
said
straight
out
that
they
should
never
know
more
about
her
than
they
knew
then
but
insisted
that
she
was
not
a
bad
woman
at
first
will
and
i
were
against
it
for
of
course
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
trying
to
get
away
from
something
but
the
women
nelly
and
my
wife
somehow
believed
in
her
and
with
the
baby
due
to
arrive
in
a
month
and
any
kind
of
help
hard
to
get
they
carried
the
day
well
sir
she
made
good
if
twenty
years
acquaintance
goes
for
anything
she
one
of
god
own
kind
and
i
do
care
a
damn
what
her
history
is
we
soon
saw
that
she
was
educated
and
refined
and
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
she
must
have
been
remarkably
beautiful
before
she
got
so
disfigured
when
the
baby
was
born
she
just
took
the
little
one
into
her
poor
broken
heart
like
it
had
been
her
own
until
sibyl
hardly
knew
which
was
her
own
mother
when
the
girl
was
old
enough
for
school
myra
begged
will
and
nelly
to
let
her
teach
the
child
she
was
always
sending
for
books
and
it
was
about
that
time
that
she
sent
for
a
violin
the
girl
took
to
music
like
a
bird
and
well
that
the
way
sibyl
was
raised
got
all
the
education
that
the
best
of
them
have
even
to
french
and
italian
and
german
and
she
missed
some
things
that
the
schools
teach
outside
of
their
she
has
a
library
given
to
her
mostly
by
myra
a
book
at
a
time
that
represents
the
best
of
the
world
best
writers
you
know
what
her
music
is
but
hell
the
ranger
interrupted
himself
with
an
apologetic
laugh
i
supposed
to
be
talking
about
myra
willard
i
do
know
as
i
so
far
off
either
because
what
sibyl
is
aside
from
her
natural
inheritance
from
will
and
nelly
myra
has
made
her
when
will
was
killed
by
those
mexican
outlaws
which
is
a
story
in
itself
nelly
sold
the
ranch
to
the
power
company
and
bought
an
orange
grove
in
fairlands
which
was
the
thing
for
her
to
do
as
she
and
myra
could
handle
that
sort
of
property
and
the
ranch
had
to
go
anyway
before
nelly
died
she
and
i
talked
things
over
and
she
put
everything
in
myra
hands
in
trust
for
the
girl
later
myra
sold
the
grove
and
the
house
where
you
men
live
now
and
bought
the
little
place
next
door
putting
the
rest
of
the
money
into
securities
in
name
which
insures
the
girl
against
want
for
years
to
come
sibyl
helps
out
their
income
with
her
music
and
that
the
story
boys
except
that
they
come
up
here
into
the
mountains
every
summer
to
spend
a
month
or
so
in
the
old
home
place
the
ranger
rose
to
go
but
do
you
think
it
is
safe
for
those
women
to
stay
up
there
alone
asked
aaron
king
brian
oakley
laughed
safe
you
do
know
myra
willard
sibyl
herself
can
pick
a
squirrel
out
of
the
tallest
pine
in
the
mountains
with
her
will
and
i
taught
her
all
we
knew
as
she
grew
up
besides
you
see
i
drop
in
every
day
or
so
to
see
that
they
all
right
he
laughed
meaningly
as
he
added
to
conrad
lagrange
for
the
benefit
i
going
to
tell
them
though
that
sibyl
must
be
careful
how
she
goes
dancing
around
these
hills
now
that
she
has
such
distinguished
but
irresponsible
neighbors
he
whistled
and
the
chestnut
horse
was
at
his
side
before
the
echo
of
their
laughter
died
away
with
a
the
ranger
rode
away
into
the
night
chapter
xvi
when
the
canyon
gates
are
shut
if
aaron
king
had
questioned
what
it
was
that
had
held
him
in
the
cedar
thicket
until
brian
oakley
heavy
hand
broke
the
spell
he
would
probably
have
answered
that
it
was
his
artistic
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
scene
but
deep
down
in
the
man
inner
consciousness
there
was
a
still
small
voice
declaring
with
an
insistency
not
to
be
denied
that
for
him
there
was
a
something
in
that
picture
that
was
not
to
be
put
into
the
vernacular
of
his
profession
had
he
acted
without
his
habitual
the
day
following
the
ranger
visit
he
would
again
have
gone
fishing
up
clear
creek
at
least
to
the
pool
where
that
master
trout
had
broken
his
leader
but
he
did
not
instead
he
roamed
aimlessly
about
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
explored
the
sycamore
grove
climbed
a
little
way
up
the
mountain
spur
and
down
again
circled
the
cienaga
and
so
came
finally
to
the
ruins
of
the
house
and
barn
on
the
creek
side
of
the
orchard
not
far
from
the
lonely
fireplace
with
its
naked
chimney
a
little
old
gate
of
split
palings
in
an
ancient
fence
under
a
great
oak
at
the
top
of
a
bank
attracted
his
careless
attention
from
the
gate
he
saw
what
once
had
been
a
path
leading
down
the
bank
to
a
spring
where
the
tiny
streamlet
that
crossed
the
road
a
hundred
yards
away
on
its
course
to
clear
creek
began
pushing
open
the
gate
that
sagged
dejectedly
from
its
leaning
post
the
artist
went
down
the
path
and
found
himself
in
a
charming
nook
shut
in
on
every
side
by
the
forest
vegetation
that
watered
by
the
spring
grew
rank
and
dense
for
a
space
on
the
gate
side
of
the
spring
the
sod
was
firm
and
smooth
with
a
gray
granite
boulder
in
the
center
of
the
little
glade
and
here
and
there
wild
and
the
slender
gray
trunks
of
alder
trees
breaking
through
from
the
higher
branches
of
the
alders
that
shut
out
the
sky
with
their
dainty
leaves
hung
with
many
a
graceful
loop
and
knot
ropes
of
wild
and
curtains
of
along
the
bank
below
the
old
fence
the
wild
blackberries
disputed
possession
with
the
roses
while
the
little
stream
was
mottled
with
the
tender
green
of
watercress
and
bordered
with
moss
and
fragrant
mint
above
the
arroyo
willows
on
the
farther
side
of
the
glade
oak
knoll
with
bits
of
the
galenas
could
be
glimpsed
but
on
the
orchard
side
the
bank
with
the
old
gate
under
the
mistletoe
oak
shut
out
the
view
through
the
screen
of
alder
and
grape
and
willow
and
the
sunlight
fell
as
through
the
delicate
traceries
of
a
cathedral
window
the
bright
waters
of
the
spring
softly
held
by
the
green
sod
crept
away
under
the
living
wall
without
a
sound
but
the
deep
murmur
of
the
distant
larger
stream
reached
the
place
like
the
low
tones
of
some
great
organ
a
few
regularly
placed
stones
where
once
had
stood
the
family
with
the
names
initials
hearts
and
dates
carved
upon
the
smooth
bark
of
the
alders
now
grown
over
and
almost
obliterated
seemed
to
fill
the
spot
with
ghostly
memories
all
that
afternoon
the
artist
remained
in
the
little
retreat
the
next
day
equipped
with
easel
canvas
and
he
went
again
to
the
glade
determined
to
make
a
picture
of
the
charming
scene
for
a
month
now
uninterrupted
by
the
distractions
of
social
obligations
or
the
like
aaron
king
had
been
subjected
to
influences
that
had
aroused
the
creative
passion
of
his
artist
soul
to
its
highest
pitch
with
his
genius
clamoring
for
expression
he
had
denied
himself
the
medium
that
was
his
natural
language
forbidding
his
friend
to
accompany
him
he
worked
now
in
the
spring
glade
with
a
delight
with
an
ecstasy
that
he
had
seldom
before
felt
and
conrad
lagrange
wisely
was
content
to
let
him
go
uninterrupted
as
the
hours
of
each
day
passed
the
artist
became
more
and
more
engrossed
with
his
art
his
spirit
sang
with
the
joy
of
receiving
the
loveliness
of
the
scene
before
him
of
making
it
his
own
and
of
giving
it
forth
again
a
literal
part
of
himself
the
memories
suggested
by
the
stones
of
the
foundation
and
the
old
carvings
on
the
trees
the
sunlight
falling
so
softly
into
the
hushed
seclusion
of
the
glade
as
through
the
traceried
windows
of
a
church
and
the
deep
of
the
distant
creek
all
served
to
give
to
the
spot
the
religious
atmosphere
of
a
sanctuary
while
the
artist
abandonment
in
his
work
was
little
short
of
devotion
it
was
the
third
afternoon
when
the
painter
became
conscious
that
he
had
been
hearing
for
some
time
he
could
not
have
said
how
long
a
melody
so
blending
with
the
of
the
mountain
stream
that
it
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
music
of
the
tumbling
waters
with
his
brush
poised
between
palette
and
canvas
the
artist
paused
turning
his
head
to
listen
half
inclined
to
the
belief
that
his
fancy
was
tricking
him
but
no
the
singer
was
coming
nearer
the
melody
was
growing
more
distinct
but
still
the
voice
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
accompaniment
of
the
distant
creek
then
he
saw
her
dressed
in
soft
brown
that
blended
subtly
with
the
green
of
the
willows
the
gray
of
the
alder
trunks
the
russet
of
rose
and
and
the
umber
of
the
swinging
in
the
flickering
sunshine
the
soft
changing
and
deep
shadows
she
appeared
to
grow
out
of
the
scene
itself
even
as
her
melody
grew
out
of
the
of
the
waters
to
get
the
effect
that
satisfied
him
best
the
painter
had
placed
his
easel
a
little
back
from
the
grassy
open
spot
seated
as
he
was
on
a
low
among
the
bushes
he
would
not
have
been
easily
observed
even
by
eyes
trained
to
the
quickness
of
vision
that
belongs
to
those
reared
in
the
woods
and
hills
as
the
girl
drew
closer
he
saw
that
she
carried
a
basket
on
her
arm
and
that
she
was
picking
the
wild
blackberries
that
grew
in
such
luscious
profusion
in
the
rich
well
watered
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
sheltering
bank
unconscious
of
any
listener
as
she
gathered
the
fruit
of
nature
offering
she
sang
to
the
accompaniment
of
music
with
the
artless
freedom
of
a
wild
thing
unafraid
in
its
native
haunts
the
man
kept
very
still
presently
when
the
girl
had
moved
so
that
he
could
not
see
her
he
turned
to
his
canvas
as
if
again
absorbed
in
his
work
but
hearing
still
behind
him
the
melody
of
her
song
then
the
music
ceased
not
abruptly
but
dying
away
softly
losing
itself
again
in
the
of
the
distant
waters
as
it
had
come
for
a
while
the
artist
worked
on
not
daring
to
take
his
eyes
from
his
picture
but
feeling
in
every
tingling
nerve
of
him
that
she
was
there
at
last
as
if
compelled
he
abruptly
turned
his
head
and
looked
straight
into
her
face
the
man
had
been
apparently
so
absorbed
in
his
work
when
first
the
girl
caught
sight
of
him
that
she
had
scarcely
been
startled
when
she
had
ceased
her
song
and
he
still
had
not
looked
around
drawn
by
her
interest
in
the
picture
she
had
softly
approached
until
she
was
standing
quite
close
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
shining
with
delight
and
excited
pleasure
as
she
stood
leaning
forward
her
basket
on
her
arm
so
interested
was
she
in
the
painting
that
she
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
the
painter
and
was
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
when
he
so
suddenly
looked
directly
into
her
face
it
is
beautiful
she
said
as
though
in
answer
to
his
question
and
no
one
hearing
her
and
watching
her
face
as
she
spoke
could
have
doubted
her
sincerity
it
is
so
true
so
so
she
searched
for
a
word
and
smiled
in
triumph
when
she
found
it
so
so
beautifully
right
it
it
makes
me
feel
as
as
i
feel
when
i
am
at
church
and
the
organ
plays
soft
and
low
and
the
light
comes
slanting
through
the
window
and
some
one
reads
those
beautiful
words
lord
is
in
his
holy
temple
let
all
the
earth
keep
silence
before
him
why
exclaimed
the
artist
that
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
it
to
say
when
i
saw
this
place
and
heard
the
waters
over
there
like
a
great
organ
and
saw
how
the
sunshine
falls
through
the
trees
i
felt
as
you
say
and
i
am
trying
to
paint
the
picture
so
that
those
who
see
it
will
feel
that
way
too
her
face
was
aglow
with
enthusiastic
understanding
as
she
cried
eagerly
oh
i
know
i
know
i
like
that
with
my
music
when
i
look
at
the
mountains
sometimes
or
at
the
trees
and
flowers
or
hear
the
waters
sing
or
the
winds
call
i
i
get
so
full
and
so
so
kind
of
choked
up
inside
that
it
hurts
and
i
feel
as
though
i
must
try
to
tell
it
and
then
i
take
my
violin
and
try
and
try
to
make
the
music
say
what
i
feel
i
never
can
though
not
altogether
but
have
made
your
picture
say
what
you
feel
that
what
makes
it
so
right
is
it
they
said
in
fairlands
that
you
were
a
great
artist
and
i
understand
why
now
it
must
be
wonderful
to
put
what
you
see
and
feel
into
a
picture
like
that
where
nothing
can
ever
change
or
spoil
it
aaron
king
laughed
with
boyish
embarrassment
oh
but
i
not
a
great
artist
you
know
i
am
scarcely
known
at
all
she
looked
at
him
with
her
great
blue
eyes
sincerely
troubled
and
must
one
be
to
be
great
she
asked
might
not
an
artist
be
great
and
still
be
or
might
not
one
who
was
really
very
very
again
she
seemed
to
search
for
a
word
and
as
she
found
it
smiled
very
be
known
all
over
the
world
the
newspapers
make
some
really
bad
people
famous
sometimes
do
they
no
no
you
are
joking
you
do
not
really
think
that
being
known
to
the
world
and
greatness
are
the
same
the
man
studying
her
closely
saw
that
she
was
speaking
her
thoughts
as
openly
as
a
child
experimentally
he
said
if
putting
what
you
feel
into
your
work
is
greatness
then
are
a
great
artist
for
your
music
does
make
one
feel
as
though
it
came
from
the
mountains
themselves
she
was
frankly
pleased
and
cried
intimately
oh
do
you
like
my
music
i
so
wanted
you
to
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
ask
when
he
had
heard
her
music
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
explain
they
neither
of
them
thought
to
remember
that
they
had
not
been
introduced
they
really
should
have
pretended
that
they
did
not
know
each
other
sometimes
she
continued
with
winsome
confidence
i
think
myself
that
i
am
really
a
great
violinist
and
then
again
she
added
wistfully
i
know
that
i
am
not
but
i
am
sure
that
i
would
like
to
be
famous
at
all
he
laughed
fame
does
seem
to
matter
so
much
does
it
when
one
is
up
here
in
the
hills
and
the
canyon
gates
are
closed
she
echoed
his
laughter
with
quick
delight
did
you
see
that
did
you
see
those
great
doors
open
to
let
you
in
and
then
close
again
behind
you
as
if
to
shut
the
world
outside
but
of
course
you
would
any
one
who
could
do
that
she
pointed
to
the
canvas
would
not
fail
to
see
the
canyon
gates
with
her
eyes
again
upon
the
picture
she
seemed
once
more
to
forget
the
presence
of
the
painter
watching
her
face
that
betrayed
her
every
passing
thought
and
emotion
as
an
untroubled
pool
mirrors
the
flowers
that
grow
on
its
banks
or
the
that
pauses
to
drink
the
artist
to
change
her
mood
said
you
the
mountains
do
you
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
again
as
she
answered
simply
yes
i
love
the
mountains
if
you
were
a
painter
he
smiled
you
would
paint
them
you
i
do
know
that
i
would
she
answered
thoughtfully
but
i
would
try
to
get
the
mountains
into
my
picture
whatever
it
was
i
wonder
if
you
know
what
i
mean
yes
he
answered
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
and
it
is
a
beautiful
thought
you
would
paint
portraits
would
you
i
do
think
i
she
answered
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
so
hard
to
get
the
mountains
into
a
portrait
of
just
anybody
an
artist
a
great
artist
i
mean
must
make
his
picture
right
must
he
and
if
his
picture
was
a
portrait
of
some
one
who
was
very
good
and
he
made
it
right
he
would
be
liked
very
well
would
he
no
i
do
think
i
would
paint
portraits
unless
i
could
paint
just
the
people
who
would
want
me
to
make
my
picture
right
aaron
king
face
flushed
at
the
words
that
were
spoken
so
artlessly
and
he
looked
at
her
keenly
but
the
girl
was
wholly
innocent
of
any
purpose
other
than
to
express
her
thoughts
she
did
not
dream
of
the
force
with
which
her
simple
words
had
gone
home
you
love
the
mountains
too
do
you
she
asked
suddenly
yes
he
answered
i
love
the
mountains
i
am
learning
to
love
them
more
and
more
but
i
fear
i
do
know
them
as
well
as
you
do
i
was
born
up
here
she
said
and
lived
here
until
a
few
years
ago
i
think
sometimes
that
the
mountains
almost
talk
to
me
i
wonder
if
you
would
help
me
to
know
the
mountains
as
you
know
them
he
asked
eagerly
she
drew
a
little
back
from
him
but
did
not
answer
we
are
neighbors
you
see
he
continued
smiling
i
heard
your
violin
the
other
evening
when
i
was
fishing
up
the
creek
near
where
you
live
and
so
i
know
it
is
you
who
live
next
door
to
us
in
the
orange
grove
lagrange
and
i
are
camped
just
over
there
back
of
the
orchard
may
we
not
be
friends
wo
you
help
me
to
know
your
mountains
i
know
about
you
she
said
brian
oakley
told
us
that
you
and
lagrange
were
camped
down
here
lagrange
said
that
you
are
a
good
man
brian
oakley
says
that
you
are
too
are
you
the
artist
flushed
in
his
embarrassment
he
did
not
note
the
significance
of
her
reference
to
the
novelist
at
least
he
said
gently
i
am
not
a
very
man
a
smile
broke
over
her
face
her
mood
changing
as
quickly
as
the
sunlight
breaks
through
a
cloud
i
know
you
are
not
she
said
a
man
would
have
wanted
to
paint
this
place
as
you
have
painted
it
she
turned
to
go
but
wait
he
cried
you
have
told
me
will
you
teach
me
to
know
your
mountains
as
you
know
them
i
sure
i
can
not
say
she
answered
smiling
as
she
moved
away
but
at
least
we
will
meet
again
he
urged
she
laughed
gaily
why
not
the
mountains
are
for
you
as
well
as
for
me
and
though
the
hills
so
big
the
trails
are
narrow
and
the
passes
very
few
with
another
laugh
she
slipped
away
her
brown
dress
that
in
the
shifty
lights
under
the
thick
foliage
so
harmonized
with
the
colors
of
bush
and
vine
and
tree
and
rock
being
so
quickly
lost
to
the
artist
eye
that
she
seemed
almost
to
vanish
into
the
scene
before
him
but
presently
from
beyond
the
willow
wall
he
heard
her
voice
again
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
mountain
stream
softly
the
melody
died
away
in
the
distance
losing
itself
at
last
in
the
deeper
of
the
mountain
waters
for
some
minutes
the
artist
stood
listening
thinking
he
heard
it
still
aaron
king
did
not
that
night
tell
conrad
lagrange
of
his
adventure
in
the
spring
glade
chapter
xvii
confessions
in
the
spring
glade
all
the
next
day
while
he
worked
upon
his
picture
in
the
glade
aaron
king
listened
for
that
voice
in
the
music
of
the
distant
waters
many
times
he
turned
to
search
the
flickering
light
and
shade
of
the
undergrowth
behind
him
for
a
glimpse
of
the
girl
brown
dress
and
winsome
face
the
next
day
she
came
the
artist
had
been
looking
long
at
a
splash
of
sunlight
that
fell
upon
the
gray
granite
boulder
which
was
set
in
the
green
turf
and
had
turned
to
his
canvas
for
it
seemed
to
him
only
an
instant
when
he
looked
again
at
the
boulder
she
was
standing
there
had
apparently
been
standing
there
for
some
time
waiting
with
smiling
lips
and
laughing
eyes
for
him
to
see
her
a
light
creel
hung
by
its
webbed
strap
from
her
shoulder
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
slender
fly
rod
of
good
workmanship
dressed
in
soft
brown
with
short
skirts
and
high
laced
boots
and
her
wavy
hair
tucked
under
a
wide
felt
hat
with
her
blue
eyes
shining
with
fun
and
her
warmly
tinted
skin
glowing
with
healthful
exercise
she
appeared
to
the
artist
more
as
some
mythical
spirit
of
the
mountains
than
as
a
maiden
of
flesh
and
blood
the
manner
of
her
coming
too
heightened
the
impression
he
had
heard
no
sound
of
her
approach
no
step
no
rustle
of
the
underbrush
he
had
seen
no
movement
among
the
bushes
no
parting
of
the
willows
in
the
wall
of
green
there
had
been
no
hint
of
her
nearness
he
could
not
even
guess
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
at
first
he
could
scarce
believe
his
eyes
and
sat
motionless
in
his
surprise
then
her
merry
laugh
rang
out
breaking
the
spell
springing
from
his
seat
he
went
forward
are
you
a
spirit
he
cried
you
must
be
something
unreal
you
know
the
way
you
appear
and
disappear
the
last
time
you
came
out
of
the
music
of
the
waters
and
went
again
the
same
way
you
come
out
of
the
air
or
the
trees
or
perhaps
that
gray
boulder
that
is
giving
me
such
trouble
laughing
she
answered
my
father
and
brian
oakley
taught
me
if
you
will
watch
the
wild
things
in
the
woods
you
can
learn
to
do
it
too
i
am
no
more
a
spirit
than
the
cougar
when
it
stalks
a
rabbit
in
the
chaparral
or
a
mink
as
it
slips
among
the
rocks
along
the
creek
or
a
fawn
when
it
crouches
to
hide
in
the
underbrush
you
have
been
fishing
he
asked
she
laughed
mockingly
you
are
observing
i
think
you
might
have
taken
for
granted
and
asked
what
luck
i
believe
i
might
almost
take
that
for
granted
too
he
returned
i
took
a
few
she
said
carelessly
then
with
a
charming
air
of
authority
and
now
you
must
go
back
to
your
work
i
shall
vanish
instantly
if
you
waste
another
moment
time
because
i
am
here
but
i
want
to
talk
he
protested
i
have
been
working
hard
since
noon
of
course
you
have
she
retorted
but
presently
the
light
will
change
again
and
you
wo
be
able
to
do
any
more
so
you
must
keep
busy
while
you
can
and
you
wo
vanish
if
i
go
on
with
my
work
he
asked
doubtfully
she
was
smiling
at
him
with
such
a
mischievous
air
that
he
feared
if
he
turned
away
she
would
disappear
she
laughed
aloud
not
if
you
work
she
said
but
if
you
stop
gone
as
she
spoke
she
went
toward
his
easel
and
resting
her
fly
rod
carefully
against
the
trunk
of
a
alder
slipped
the
creel
from
her
shoulder
placing
the
basket
on
the
ground
with
her
hat
then
while
the
painter
watched
her
she
stood
silently
looking
at
the
picture
presently
she
faced
him
and
with
an
impulsive
stamp
of
her
foot
said
why
you
work
how
can
you
waste
your
time
and
this
light
looking
at
me
i
shall
go
if
you
do
come
back
to
your
picture
this
minute
with
a
laugh
he
obeyed
for
a
moment
she
watched
him
then
turned
away
and
he
heard
her
moving
about
down
by
the
tiny
stream
where
it
disappeared
under
the
willows
once
he
paused
and
turned
to
look
in
her
direction
what
are
you
up
to
now
he
said
i
shall
be
up
to
leaving
you
she
retorted
if
you
look
around
again
he
promptly
turned
once
more
to
his
picture
soon
she
came
back
and
seated
herself
beside
her
creel
and
rod
where
she
could
see
the
picture
under
the
artist
brush
does
it
bother
if
i
watch
she
asked
softly
no
indeed
he
answered
it
helps
that
is
it
helps
when
it
is
who
watch
which
to
the
painter
secret
amazement
was
a
literal
truth
the
gray
rock
with
the
splash
of
sunshine
that
would
not
come
right
ceased
to
trouble
him
now
stimulated
by
her
presence
he
worked
with
a
freedom
and
a
sureness
that
was
a
delight
when
he
could
not
refrain
from
looking
in
her
direction
he
saw
that
she
was
bending
with
busy
hands
over
some
willow
twigs
in
her
lap
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
he
asked
curiously
you
are
not
supposed
to
know
that
i
am
doing
anything
she
retorted
you
have
been
peeking
again
you
were
so
still
i
feared
you
had
vanished
he
laughed
if
keep
talking
to
me
i
know
you
are
there
and
will
be
good
sure
it
wo
bother
sure
he
answered
well
then
talk
to
me
and
i
answer
i
have
a
confession
to
make
he
said
carefully
studying
the
gray
tones
of
the
alder
trunk
beyond
the
gray
boulder
a
confession
yes
i
want
to
get
it
over
so
it
wo
bother
me
something
about
me
yes
why
that
what
i
am
trying
so
hard
to
make
you
keep
your
eyes
on
your
work
for
because
have
to
make
a
confession
to
to
me
yes
do
look
around
please
but
what
under
the
sun
can
you
have
to
confess
to
me
you
started
yours
first
she
answered
go
on
maybe
it
will
make
it
easier
for
me
studiously
keeping
his
eyes
upon
his
canvas
he
told
her
how
he
had
watched
her
from
the
cedar
thicket
when
he
had
finished
and
she
was
silent
he
thought
that
she
was
angry
and
turned
about
expecting
to
see
her
gathering
up
her
things
to
go
she
was
struggling
to
suppress
her
laughter
at
the
look
of
surprise
on
his
face
she
burst
forth
in
such
a
gale
of
merriment
that
the
little
glade
was
filled
with
the
music
of
her
glee
while
in
spite
of
himself
the
painter
joined
oh
she
cried
but
that
funny
i
am
glad
glad
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
demanded
why
why
that
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
get
courage
enough
to
confess
to
you
she
gasped
and
then
she
told
him
how
she
had
spied
upon
him
from
the
arbor
in
the
rose
garden
and
how
in
his
absence
she
had
visited
his
studio
but
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
in
the
place
was
always
locked
when
i
was
away
oh
she
said
quaintly
there
was
a
good
genie
who
let
me
in
through
the
keyhole
i
did
meddle
with
anything
you
know
i
just
looked
at
the
beautiful
room
where
you
work
and
i
did
glance
even
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
the
genie
told
me
you
would
like
that
i
would
not
have
drawn
the
curtain
anyway
even
if
i
had
been
told
at
least
i
i
would
but
perhaps
i
might
i
ca
always
tell
what
i
going
to
do
you
know
suddenly
the
artist
remembered
finding
the
studio
door
open
with
conrad
lagrange
key
in
the
lock
and
how
the
novelist
had
berated
himself
with
such
exaggerated
vehemence
and
in
a
flash
came
the
thought
of
james
rutlidge
visit
that
afternoon
and
of
his
strange
manner
and
insinuating
remarks
i
think
i
know
the
name
of
your
good
genie
said
the
painter
facing
the
girl
seriously
but
tell
me
did
no
one
disturb
you
while
you
were
in
the
studio
her
cheeks
colored
painfully
and
all
the
laughter
was
gone
from
her
voice
as
she
replied
i
did
want
you
to
know
that
part
but
i
must
know
he
insisted
gravely
yes
she
said
rutlidge
found
me
there
and
i
ran
away
through
the
garden
i
do
like
him
he
frightens
me
please
is
it
necessary
for
us
to
talk
about
it
any
more
i
had
to
make
my
confession
of
course
but
must
we
talk
about
part
no
he
answered
we
need
not
talk
about
it
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
know
but
we
will
never
mention
that
part
again
when
we
are
back
in
the
orange
groves
you
shall
come
to
the
rose
garden
and
to
the
studio
as
often
as
you
like
your
good
genie
and
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
are
not
disturbed
by
any
one
her
face
brightened
at
his
words
and
do
you
really
like
for
me
to
make
music
for
you
as
lagrange
says
you
do
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
like
it
he
answered
smiling
and
it
does
bother
you
in
your
work
it
helps
me
he
declared
thinking
of
that
portrait
of
taine
oh
i
am
glad
glad
she
cried
i
wanted
it
to
help
it
was
for
that
i
played
you
played
to
help
me
he
asked
wonderingly
she
nodded
i
thought
it
might
if
i
could
get
enough
of
the
mountains
into
my
music
you
know
and
will
you
dance
for
me
sometimes
too
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
tell
about
that
you
see
i
only
dance
when
i
must
when
the
music
somehow
does
seem
quite
enough
when
i
when
i
she
searched
for
a
word
then
finished
abruptly
oh
i
ca
tell
you
about
it
it
just
something
you
feel
there
are
no
words
for
it
when
i
first
come
to
the
mountains
after
living
in
fairlands
all
winter
i
always
dance
the
mountains
feel
so
big
and
strong
and
sometimes
i
dance
in
the
moonlight
when
it
feels
so
soft
and
light
and
clean
or
in
the
twilight
when
it
so
still
and
the
air
is
so
so
full
of
the
day
that
has
come
home
to
rest
and
sleep
and
sometimes
when
i
am
away
up
under
the
big
pines
and
the
wind
from
off
the
mountain
tops
under
the
sky
sings
through
the
dark
branches
but
do
you
ever
dance
to
please
your
friends
oh
no
i
do
dance
to
any
one
only
just
when
it
for
myself
when
nothing
else
will
do
when
i
of
course
sometimes
myra
or
brian
oakley
or
oakley
are
with
me
but
they
do
matter
you
know
they
are
so
much
a
part
of
me
that
i
do
mind
i
wonder
if
you
will
ever
dance
for
me
again
she
shook
her
head
i
do
think
so
how
could
i
you
see
you
are
not
like
anybody
that
i
have
ever
known
but
i
saw
you
the
other
evening
you
remember
yes
but
i
did
know
you
were
there
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
danced
all
the
while
as
she
talked
her
fingers
had
been
busy
with
the
slender
willow
branches
and
now
she
said
abruptly
changing
the
subject
and
smiling
as
she
spoke
and
now
you
must
turn
back
to
your
work
but
the
light
is
not
right
he
protested
never
mind
you
must
pretend
that
it
is
she
retorted
ca
you
pretend
to
humor
her
he
obeyed
laughing
you
may
look
now
she
said
a
minute
later
he
turned
to
see
her
standing
close
beside
him
holding
out
a
charming
little
basket
that
she
had
woven
of
the
green
willows
and
decorated
with
moss
and
watercress
in
the
basket
on
the
cool
damp
moss
and
lightly
covered
with
the
cress
lay
a
half
dozen
fine
rainbow
trout
how
pretty
he
exclaimed
so
that
is
what
you
have
been
doing
they
are
for
you
she
said
simply
for
me
he
cried
she
nodded
brightly
for
you
and
lagrange
i
know
you
like
them
because
you
said
you
were
fishing
when
you
heard
my
violin
and
i
thought
that
you
would
want
to
leave
your
picture
to
fish
for
yourself
so
i
took
them
for
you
the
artist
concealed
his
embarrassment
with
difficulty
and
while
expressing
his
thanks
and
appreciation
in
rather
formal
words
studied
her
face
keenly
but
she
had
tendered
her
gift
with
a
spontaneous
naturalness
an
unaffected
kindliness
and
an
innocent
disregard
of
conventionalities
that
would
have
disarmed
a
man
with
much
less
native
gentleness
than
aaron
king
leaving
the
basket
of
trout
in
his
hand
she
turned
and
swung
the
empty
creel
over
her
shoulder
then
putting
on
her
hat
she
picked
up
her
rod
oh
are
you
going
he
said
you
have
finished
your
work
for
she
answered
but
let
me
go
with
you
a
little
way
she
shook
her
head
no
i
do
want
you
but
you
will
come
again
perhaps
if
you
wo
stop
work
but
i
ca
promise
you
see
i
never
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
up
here
in
the
mountains
she
answered
whimsically
i
might
go
to
the
top
of
old
in
the
morning
or
i
might
be
here
waiting
for
you
when
you
come
to
paint
he
was
putting
his
things
in
the
box
thinking
he
would
persuade
her
to
let
him
accompany
her
a
little
way
if
she
saw
that
he
really
would
paint
no
more
when
he
bent
over
the
box
she
was
speaking
i
hope
you
will
he
answered
there
was
no
reply
he
straightened
up
and
looked
around
she
was
gone
for
some
time
he
stood
searching
the
glade
with
his
eyes
carefully
listening
to
catch
a
sound
a
puzzled
baffled
look
upon
his
face
taking
his
things
at
last
he
started
up
the
little
path
but
before
he
reached
the
old
gate
a
low
laugh
caused
him
to
whirl
quickly
about
there
she
stood
beside
the
spring
a
teasing
smile
on
her
face
before
he
could
command
himself
she
danced
a
step
or
two
with
an
elfish
air
and
slipped
away
through
the
green
willow
wall
another
merry
laugh
came
back
to
him
and
then
the
silence
of
the
little
glade
and
the
sound
of
the
distant
waters
with
the
basket
of
fish
in
his
hand
aaron
king
went
slowly
to
camp
where
when
conrad
lagrange
saw
what
the
artist
carried
so
carefully
explanations
were
in
order
chapter
xviii
sibyl
andr√©s
and
the
butterflies
on
the
following
day
the
artist
was
putting
away
his
things
at
the
close
of
the
afternoon
work
when
the
girl
appeared
the
long
slanting
bars
of
sunshine
and
the
deepening
shadows
marked
the
lateness
of
the
hour
as
he
bent
over
his
the
man
was
thinking
with
regret
that
she
would
not
come
that
perhaps
she
would
never
come
and
at
the
thought
that
he
might
not
see
her
again
an
odd
fear
gripped
his
heart
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
low
musical
laugh
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
to
search
the
glade
with
careful
eyes
come
out
he
cried
as
though
adjuring
an
invisible
spirit
i
know
you
are
here
come
out
with
another
laugh
she
stepped
from
behind
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
largest
trees
within
a
few
feet
of
where
he
stood
as
she
went
toward
him
she
carried
in
her
outstretched
hands
a
graceful
basket
woven
of
sycamore
leaves
and
ferns
and
filled
with
the
ripest
sweetest
blackberries
she
did
not
speak
as
she
held
out
her
offering
but
the
man
looking
into
her
laughing
eyes
fancied
that
there
was
a
meaning
and
a
purpose
in
the
gift
that
did
not
appear
upon
the
surface
of
her
simple
action
expressing
his
pleasure
as
he
received
the
dainty
basket
he
could
not
refrain
from
adding
but
why
do
you
bring
me
things
she
answered
with
that
wayward
mocking
humor
that
so
often
seized
her
because
i
like
to
i
told
you
that
i
always
do
what
i
like
up
here
in
the
mountains
i
hope
you
always
will
he
returned
if
your
likes
are
all
as
delicious
as
this
one
with
the
manner
of
a
child
playfully
making
a
mystery
yet
anxious
to
have
the
secret
discussed
she
said
i
have
one
more
gift
to
bring
you
yet
i
knew
you
meant
something
by
your
presents
he
cried
it
is
just
because
you
want
me
to
have
the
things
you
bring
oh
yes
it
is
she
retorted
laughing
mischievously
at
his
triumphant
and
expectant
tone
if
i
did
want
you
to
have
the
things
i
bring
why
i
would
bring
them
would
i
but
that
is
all
he
insisted
tell
me
why
do
you
say
you
have
one
gift
to
bring
she
shook
her
head
with
a
delightful
air
of
mystery
not
until
i
come
again
when
i
come
again
i
will
tell
you
and
you
will
come
she
laughed
teasingly
at
his
eagerness
how
can
i
tell
she
answered
i
do
not
know
myself
what
i
will
do
when
i
am
up
here
in
the
mountains
when
the
canyon
gates
are
shut
and
the
world
is
left
outside
even
as
she
spoke
her
mood
changed
and
the
last
words
were
uttered
wistfully
as
a
captive
spirit
that
by
nature
wild
and
free
was
permitted
for
a
brief
time
only
to
go
beyond
its
prison
walls
might
have
spoken
the
artist
puzzled
by
her
change
of
moods
and
by
her
manner
as
she
spoke
of
the
world
beyond
the
canyon
gates
had
no
words
to
reply
as
he
stood
there
in
that
little
glade
where
the
light
fell
as
in
a
quiet
cathedral
and
the
air
trembled
with
the
deep
of
the
distant
waters
holding
in
his
hands
the
basket
of
leaves
and
ferns
with
its
wild
fruit
and
looking
at
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
brought
her
offering
with
the
naturalness
of
a
child
of
the
mountains
and
the
air
of
a
woodland
spirit
he
again
felt
that
the
world
he
had
always
known
was
very
far
away
the
girl
too
was
silent
as
though
by
some
subtle
power
she
knew
his
thoughts
and
did
not
wish
to
interrupt
so
still
were
they
that
a
wild
bird
darting
through
the
screen
of
alder
boughs
stopped
to
swing
on
a
limb
above
their
heads
with
a
burst
of
melody
in
the
arroyo
beyond
the
willow
wall
a
quail
called
his
evening
call
and
was
answered
by
his
mate
from
the
top
of
the
bank
under
the
mistletoe
oak
a
pair
of
gray
squirrels
crept
down
the
gray
trunks
of
the
trees
and
slipped
around
the
granite
boulder
to
drink
at
the
spring
then
scampered
away
again
half
in
frolic
half
in
fright
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
man
and
the
maid
as
the
squirrels
disappeared
the
girl
laughed
a
low
laugh
of
fellowship
with
the
creatures
of
the
wilderness
in
complete
understanding
of
their
humor
then
as
though
following
the
path
of
a
sunbeam
two
gorgeously
brown
and
yellow
winged
butterflies
came
flitting
through
the
draperies
of
and
floated
in
zigzag
flight
about
the
glade
now
high
among
the
alder
boughs
now
low
over
the
tops
of
the
roses
and
down
to
the
fragrant
mint
at
the
water
edge
and
up
again
to
the
tops
of
the
willows
as
if
to
leave
the
glade
but
only
to
return
again
to
the
vines
that
covered
the
bank
and
to
the
flowers
that
here
and
there
starred
the
grassy
sward
oh
cried
the
girl
impulsively
as
the
beautiful
winged
creatures
disappeared
at
last
if
people
could
only
be
like
that
it
so
hard
to
be
yourself
in
the
world
everybody
there
seems
trying
to
be
something
they
are
not
no
one
dares
to
be
just
themselves
everything
up
here
is
so
right
so
true
so
just
what
it
is
and
down
there
everything
tries
so
hard
to
be
just
what
it
is
not
the
world
even
so
crooked
that
it
believe
when
a
thing
is
just
what
it
is
while
watching
the
butterflies
she
had
turned
away
from
the
artist
and
in
following
their
flight
with
her
eyes
had
taken
a
few
light
steps
that
brought
her
into
the
open
grassy
center
of
the
glade
with
her
face
upturned
to
the
opening
in
the
foliage
through
which
the
butterflies
had
disappeared
she
had
spoken
as
if
thinking
aloud
rather
than
as
addressing
her
companion
before
the
artist
could
reply
the
beautiful
creatures
came
floating
back
as
they
had
gone
with
a
low
exclamation
of
delight
the
girl
watched
them
as
they
circled
now
above
her
head
in
their
aerial
waltz
among
the
sunbeams
and
leafy
boughs
then
the
man
watching
saw
her
unheeding
his
presence
stretch
her
arms
upward
for
a
moment
she
stood
lightly
poised
and
then
with
her
wide
shining
eyes
fixed
upon
those
gorgeously
winged
spirits
whirling
in
the
fragrant
air
with
her
lips
parted
in
smiling
delight
she
danced
upon
the
smooth
turf
of
the
glade
every
step
and
movement
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
abandonment
that
marked
the
movements
of
the
butterflies
that
danced
above
her
head
unmindful
of
the
watching
man
as
her
dainty
companions
themselves
forgetful
of
his
presence
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
to
express
her
emotions
in
free
rhythmic
movement
instinctively
aaron
king
was
silent
standing
motionless
as
if
he
feared
to
startle
her
into
flight
suddenly
as
the
girl
danced
her
eyes
always
upon
her
winged
companions
the
insects
floated
above
the
artist
head
and
she
became
conscious
of
his
presence
her
cheeks
flushed
and
laughing
low
as
she
danced
lightly
as
a
spirit
she
impulsively
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
in
merry
invitation
as
though
challenging
him
to
join
her
the
gesture
was
as
spontaneous
and
as
innocent
in
its
freedom
as
had
been
her
offering
of
the
gifts
from
mountain
stream
and
bush
but
the
man
lured
into
forgetfulness
of
everything
save
the
wild
loveliness
of
the
scene
started
toward
her
at
his
movement
a
look
of
bewildered
fear
came
into
her
face
but
too
startled
to
control
her
movements
on
the
instant
and
as
though
impelled
by
some
hidden
power
she
moved
toward
him
blindly
unconsciously
her
eyes
wide
with
that
look
of
questioning
fright
he
had
almost
reached
her
when
as
though
by
an
effort
of
her
will
she
stopped
and
stood
still
gazing
into
his
face
trembling
in
every
limb
then
with
a
low
cry
she
sank
down
in
a
frightened
cowering
pleading
attitude
and
buried
her
crimson
face
in
her
hands
as
though
some
unseen
hand
checked
him
the
man
halted
and
the
cheeks
were
not
more
crimson
than
his
own
a
moment
he
stood
then
a
step
brought
him
to
her
side
putting
out
his
hand
he
touched
her
upon
the
shoulder
and
was
about
to
speak
but
at
his
touch
with
another
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
whirling
with
the
quickness
of
a
wild
thing
vanished
into
the
undergrowth
that
walled
in
the
glade
with
a
startled
exclamation
the
man
tried
to
follow
calling
to
her
reassuring
her
begging
her
to
come
back
but
there
was
no
answer
to
his
words
nor
did
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
though
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
heard
her
in
swift
flight
up
the
canyon
all
the
way
to
the
place
where
he
had
first
seen
her
he
followed
but
at
the
cedar
thicket
he
stopped
for
a
long
time
he
stood
there
while
the
twilight
failed
and
the
night
came
slowly
in
the
soft
darkness
with
bowed
head
as
one
humbled
and
ashamed
he
went
back
down
the
canyon
to
the
little
glade
and
to
the
camp
chapter
xix
the
three
gifts
and
their
meanings
the
next
day
aaron
king
too
distracted
to
paint
idled
all
the
afternoon
in
the
glade
but
the
girl
did
not
come
when
it
was
dark
he
returned
to
camp
telling
himself
that
she
would
never
come
again
that
his
rude
yielding
to
the
lure
of
her
wild
beauty
had
rightly
broken
forever
the
charm
of
their
intimacy
and
he
cursed
himself
as
many
a
man
has
cursed
for
that
momentary
lack
of
but
the
following
afternoon
as
the
artist
worked
bent
upon
quickly
finishing
his
picture
of
the
place
that
seemed
now
to
reproach
him
with
its
sweet
atmosphere
of
sacred
purity
he
heard
as
he
had
heard
that
first
day
the
low
music
of
her
voice
blending
with
the
music
of
the
mountain
stream
scarce
daring
to
move
he
sat
as
though
absorbed
in
his
work
listening
with
all
his
heart
for
some
sound
of
her
approach
other
than
the
melody
of
her
song
that
grew
more
and
more
distinct
at
last
he
knew
that
she
was
standing
just
the
other
side
of
the
willows
beyond
the
little
spring
he
felt
her
hidden
eyes
upon
him
but
dared
not
look
that
way
feeling
sure
that
if
he
betrayed
himself
in
too
eager
haste
she
would
vanish
bending
forward
toward
his
canvas
he
made
show
of
giving
close
attention
to
his
work
and
waited
for
some
minutes
she
remained
concealed
singing
low
as
though
to
try
him
with
temptation
then
all
at
once
as
the
painter
with
poised
brush
glanced
from
his
canvas
to
the
scene
she
stood
in
full
view
beside
the
spring
her
graceful
figure
framed
by
the
green
her
arms
were
filled
with
wild
flowers
that
she
had
gathered
from
the
mountainside
from
nook
and
glade
and
glen
if
you
will
not
seek
me
there
is
no
use
to
hide
she
called
still
holding
her
place
on
the
other
side
of
the
spring
and
regarding
him
seriously
and
the
man
felt
under
her
words
and
saw
in
her
wide
blue
eyes
a
troubled
question
i
sought
you
all
the
way
to
your
home
he
said
gently
but
you
would
not
let
me
come
near
i
was
frightened
she
returned
not
lowering
her
eyes
but
regarding
him
steadily
with
that
questioning
appeal
i
am
sorry
he
said
wo
you
forgive
me
i
will
never
frighten
you
so
again
i
did
not
mean
to
do
it
why
she
answered
i
have
to
forgive
myself
as
well
as
you
you
see
i
frightened
myself
quite
as
much
as
you
frightened
me
i
ca
feel
that
you
were
really
to
blame
any
more
than
i
have
tried
but
i
ca
so
i
came
back
only
i
i
must
never
dance
for
you
again
must
i
the
man
could
not
answer
as
though
fully
reassured
and
quite
satisfied
to
take
his
answer
for
granted
she
sprang
over
the
tiny
stream
at
her
feet
and
came
to
him
across
the
glade
holding
out
her
arms
full
of
blossoms
see
she
said
with
a
smile
i
have
brought
you
the
last
one
of
the
three
gifts
gracefully
she
knelt
and
placed
the
flowers
on
the
ground
beside
his
box
of
colors
deeply
moved
by
her
honesty
and
by
her
simple
trust
in
him
and
charmed
by
the
air
of
quiet
natural
dignity
with
which
she
spoke
of
her
gifts
the
artist
tried
to
thank
her
and
now
he
added
the
meaning
tell
me
the
meaning
of
your
gifts
you
promised
you
remember
that
you
would
read
the
pretty
riddle
when
you
came
again
she
laughed
merrily
and
have
you
guessed
the
meaning
she
said
in
her
teasing
mood
how
could
i
he
retorted
i
was
not
schooled
in
your
mountains
you
know
your
world
up
here
is
still
a
strange
world
to
me
still
smiling
with
the
pleasure
of
her
fancy
she
replied
but
did
you
ask
me
again
and
again
to
help
you
to
know
the
mountains
as
i
know
them
yes
he
said
but
you
would
not
promise
i
did
better
than
promise
she
returned
i
brought
you
from
the
mountains
themselves
their
three
greatest
gifts
he
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
backward
schoolboy
wo
you
read
the
lesson
if
you
will
work
while
i
talk
i
will
she
answered
amused
by
the
hopelessness
of
his
manner
and
tone
obediently
he
took
up
his
brushes
and
turned
toward
his
picture
removing
her
hat
she
seated
herself
on
the
ground
where
she
had
woven
the
willow
basket
for
the
fish
after
a
moment
silence
she
began
timidly
at
first
then
with
increasing
confidence
as
she
found
words
to
express
her
charming
fancy
first
you
must
know
that
in
all
the
wild
life
of
the
mountains
there
is
no
creature
so
strong
in
proportion
to
its
size
and
weight
i
mean
as
the
trout
that
lives
in
the
mountain
streams
its
home
is
in
the
icy
torrents
that
are
fed
by
the
snows
of
the
highest
peaks
and
canyons
it
lives
literally
in
the
innermost
heart
and
life
of
the
hills
it
seeks
its
food
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
where
the
water
boils
in
fierce
fury
where
the
current
swirls
and
leaps
among
the
boulders
and
where
the
stream
rushes
with
all
its
might
down
the
rocky
channels
with
its
muscles
fine
as
tempered
steel
it
forces
its
way
against
the
strength
of
the
stream
conquering
even
the
downward
pour
of
a
cataract
its
strength
is
a
silent
strength
it
has
no
voice
other
than
the
voice
of
its
own
beautiful
self
and
all
its
gleaming
colors
you
may
see
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
tinting
the
mighty
heads
and
shoulders
and
sides
of
the
hills
themselves
and
so
the
first
gift
that
i
brought
you
fresh
from
the
mountain
heart
was
the
gift
of
the
strength
the
second
gift
was
gathered
from
bushes
that
were
never
planted
by
the
hand
of
man
they
grow
as
free
and
untamed
as
the
rains
that
water
them
and
the
earth
that
feeds
them
and
the
sunshine
that
sweetens
hem
in
them
is
the
flavor
of
mountain
mists
and
low
hung
clouds
and
shining
dew
the
odor
of
moist
and
unimpoverished
soil
the
pleasant
tang
of
the
sunshine
and
the
softer
sweetness
of
the
shady
nooks
where
they
grow
in
the
second
gift
i
brought
you
the
purity
and
the
flavor
of
the
mountains
and
she
finished
simply
i
have
brought
you
the
beauty
of
the
hills
you
have
brought
me
more
than
the
strength
and
purity
and
beauty
of
the
mountains
exclaimed
the
painter
you
have
brought
me
their
mystery
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
in
your
own
beautiful
self
he
continued
sincerely
you
have
brought
me
the
mystery
of
these
hills
you
are
wonderful
i
have
never
known
any
one
like
you
she
was
wholly
unconscious
of
the
compliment
if
indeed
he
meant
it
as
such
i
suppose
i
must
be
different
she
returned
with
just
a
touch
of
sadness
in
her
voice
you
see
i
have
never
been
taught
like
other
girls
i
know
nothing
at
all
of
the
world
where
you
live
except
what
myra
has
told
me
then
as
if
to
change
the
subject
she
asked
shyly
would
you
care
for
my
music
he
assented
eagerly
thinking
she
meant
to
sing
but
rising
she
crossed
the
glade
and
disappeared
behind
the
willows
returning
a
moment
later
with
her
violin
in
answer
to
his
exclamation
of
pleased
surprise
she
said
smiling
i
brought
my
violin
because
i
thought
if
you
would
let
me
play
the
music
would
perhaps
help
us
both
to
forget
what
what
happened
when
i
danced
standing
by
the
gray
boulder
with
her
face
up
turned
to
the
mountains
she
placed
the
instrument
under
her
chin
and
drew
the
bow
softly
across
the
strings
for
an
hour
or
more
she
played
then
as
czar
trotted
sedately
into
the
glade
she
lowered
her
instrument
and
with
a
smile
called
merrily
to
conrad
lagrange
who
attracted
by
the
music
was
standing
at
the
gate
on
the
bank
from
the
artist
position
invisible
come
down
good
genie
come
down
you
have
been
watching
there
quite
long
enough
come
instantly
or
with
my
magic
i
turn
you
into
a
fantastic
dancing
bug
such
as
those
that
straddle
there
upon
the
waters
of
the
spring
or
else
into
a
fat
pollywog
that
wiggles
in
the
black
ooze
among
the
dead
leaves
and
rotting
bits
of
wood
with
a
quick
movement
she
tucked
her
violin
under
her
chin
and
played
a
few
measures
of
the
worst
sort
of
ragtime
in
perfect
imitation
of
a
popular
performer
the
effect
following
the
music
she
had
just
been
making
was
grotesque
and
horrible
mercy
mercy
cried
the
man
at
the
gate
i
beg
i
beg
do
not
i
pray
good
nymph
torture
me
with
thy
dreadful
power
i
swear
that
i
will
obey
thy
every
wish
and
whim
pointing
with
her
bow
as
with
a
wand
to
the
boulder
she
sternly
commanded
come
then
and
sit
here
upon
this
rock
and
give
to
me
an
account
of
all
that
thou
hast
done
since
i
left
thee
in
the
rose
garden
or
i
will
split
thy
ears
and
stretch
thy
soul
upon
a
torture
rack
of
hideous
noise
she
lifted
her
violin
again
threateningly
the
novelist
came
down
the
path
on
a
run
to
seat
himself
upon
the
gray
boulder
the
artist
shouted
with
laughter
but
the
novelist
and
the
girl
paid
no
heed
to
his
unseemly
merriment
speak
she
commanded
waving
her
wand
what
hast
thou
done
did
i
not
obey
thy
will
and
under
such
terms
as
i
could
procure
open
for
thee
the
treasure
room
of
thy
desire
growled
the
man
on
the
rock
and
still
she
retorted
when
i
made
myself
subject
to
those
terms
and
obediently
looked
not
upon
the
hidden
mystery
still
the
room
of
my
desires
became
a
trap
betraying
me
into
rude
hands
from
which
i
narrowly
escaped
and
you
you
fled
the
scene
of
your
without
so
much
as
and
for
these
long
weeks
have
wandered
irresponsible
among
my
hills
did
you
not
say
that
my
home
was
under
these
glowing
peaks
and
in
the
purple
shadows
of
these
canyons
did
you
think
that
i
would
not
find
you
here
and
charm
you
again
within
reach
of
my
power
and
what
is
thy
will
good
spirit
he
asked
humbly
tell
me
thy
will
and
it
shall
be
done
if
thou
wilt
but
make
music
upon
the
instrument
that
is
in
thy
hand
with
a
laugh
she
ended
the
play
saying
my
will
is
that
you
and
king
come
evening
for
supper
with
miss
willard
and
me
brian
oakley
and
oakley
will
be
there
i
want
you
too
the
men
looked
at
each
other
in
doubt
really
miss
andr√©s
said
the
artist
we
the
girl
interrupted
with
one
of
her
changes
i
have
invited
you
you
come
i
shall
expect
you
and
before
either
of
the
men
could
speak
again
she
sprang
lightly
across
the
little
stream
and
disappeared
through
the
willow
wall
well
i
be
the
novelist
checked
himself
solemnly
staring
blankly
at
the
spot
where
she
had
disappeared
the
artist
laughed
what
do
you
think
of
it
demanded
conrad
lagrange
turning
to
his
friend
aaron
king
packing
up
his
things
answered
i
think
we
better
go
which
opinion
was
concurred
in
by
brian
oakley
who
dropped
in
on
them
that
evening
chapter
xx
myra
prayer
and
the
ranger
warning
that
same
afternoon
while
sibyl
andr√©s
was
making
music
for
aaron
king
in
the
spring
glade
brian
oakley
on
his
way
down
the
canyon
stopped
at
the
old
place
where
myra
willard
and
the
girl
were
living
riding
into
the
yard
that
was
fenced
only
by
the
wild
growth
he
was
greeted
cordially
by
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
who
was
seated
on
the
porch
howdy
myra
he
called
in
return
as
he
swung
from
the
saddle
and
leaving
the
chestnut
to
roam
at
will
he
went
to
the
porch
his
spurs
clinking
softly
over
the
short
thick
grass
where
sibyl
he
asked
seating
himself
on
the
top
step
i
sure
i
do
know
oakley
the
woman
answered
smiling
you
really
did
expect
me
to
did
you
the
ranger
laughed
did
she
take
gun
basket
rod
or
violin
if
i
know
whether
she
gone
shooting
berrying
fishing
or
fiddling
it
may
give
me
a
clue
or
did
she
take
all
four
the
woman
watched
him
closely
she
took
only
her
violin
she
went
sometime
after
lunch
down
the
canyon
i
think
do
you
wish
particularly
to
see
her
mr
oakley
it
was
evident
to
the
woman
that
the
officer
was
relieved
oh
no
she
would
be
going
far
with
her
violin
if
she
went
down
the
canyon
all
right
anyway
but
i
stopped
in
to
tell
the
girl
that
she
must
be
careful
for
a
while
there
an
escaped
convict
ranging
somewhere
in
my
district
i
received
the
word
this
morning
and
have
been
up
around
lone
cabin
and
burnt
pine
and
the
head
of
clear
creek
to
see
if
i
could
start
anything
i
did
find
any
signs
but
the
information
is
reliable
tell
sibyl
that
i
say
she
must
not
go
out
without
her
gun
that
if
i
catch
her
wandering
around
unarmed
i
pack
her
off
back
to
civilization
pronto
i
tell
her
said
myra
willard
and
i
help
her
to
remember
it
would
be
better
i
suppose
if
she
stayed
at
home
but
that
seems
so
impossible
she
be
all
right
if
she
has
her
gun
asserted
the
ranger
confidently
i
back
the
girl
against
anything
i
ever
met
up
with
when
she
has
her
artillery
by
the
way
myra
have
your
neighbors
below
called
yet
no
at
least
not
while
i
have
been
at
home
i
have
been
berrying
two
or
three
times
they
might
have
come
while
i
was
out
has
sibyl
met
them
yet
came
the
next
question
she
has
not
mentioned
it
if
she
has
mused
brian
oakley
the
woman
love
for
the
girl
prompted
her
to
quick
suspicion
of
the
ranger
manner
what
is
it
mr
oakley
she
asked
has
the
child
been
indiscreet
has
she
done
anything
wrong
has
she
been
with
those
men
she
has
called
upon
one
of
them
several
times
returned
brian
smiling
king
is
painting
that
little
glade
by
the
old
spring
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
you
know
and
i
guess
she
stumbled
onto
him
the
place
is
one
of
her
favorite
spots
but
bless
your
heart
myra
there
no
harm
in
it
it
would
be
natural
for
her
to
get
interested
in
any
one
making
a
picture
of
a
place
she
loves
as
she
does
that
old
spring
glade
she
has
spent
days
at
a
time
there
ever
since
she
was
big
enough
to
go
that
far
from
home
it
strange
that
she
has
not
mentioned
it
to
me
said
the
woman
troubled
in
spite
of
the
ranger
reassuring
words
the
man
directed
his
attention
suddenly
to
his
horse
max
you
let
sibyl
roses
alone
the
animal
turned
his
head
questioningly
toward
his
master
back
said
the
ranger
back
at
his
word
the
chestnut
promptly
backed
across
the
yard
until
the
officer
called
that
will
do
when
he
halted
and
with
an
impatient
toss
of
his
head
again
looked
toward
the
porch
inquiringly
you
are
all
right
now
said
the
man
whereupon
the
horse
began
contentedly
cropping
the
grass
i
met
king
accidentally
once
at
the
depot
in
fairlands
continued
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
he
impressed
me
then
as
being
a
genuinely
good
man
a
true
gentleman
but
judging
from
his
books
conrad
lagrange
is
not
a
man
i
would
wish
sibyl
to
meet
i
have
wondered
at
the
artist
friendship
with
him
i
tell
you
myra
lagrange
is
all
right
said
brian
oakley
stoutly
he
odd
and
eccentric
and
rough
spoken
sometimes
but
he
not
at
all
what
you
would
think
him
from
the
stuff
he
writes
he
a
true
man
at
heart
and
you
need
worry
about
sibyl
getting
anything
but
good
from
an
acquaintance
with
him
as
for
king
well
conrad
lagrange
vouches
for
him
if
you
knew
lagrange
you
understand
what
that
means
he
and
the
young
fellow
mother
grew
up
together
he
swears
the
lad
is
right
and
from
what
i
seen
of
him
i
believe
it
it
does
follow
though
that
you
do
need
to
keep
your
eyes
open
the
girl
is
as
innocent
as
a
child
though
she
is
a
woman
and
well
accidents
have
happened
you
know
as
he
spoke
he
glanced
unconsciously
at
the
scars
that
disfigured
the
naturally
beautiful
face
of
the
woman
myra
willard
blushed
as
she
answered
sadly
yes
i
know
that
accidents
have
happened
i
will
talk
with
sibyl
and
will
you
not
speak
to
her
too
she
loves
you
so
and
is
always
guided
by
your
wishes
a
little
word
or
two
from
you
would
be
an
added
safeguard
sure
i
talk
to
her
said
the
ranger
heartily
rising
and
whistling
to
the
chestnut
but
look
here
myra
he
said
pausing
with
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
the
girl
must
have
her
head
you
know
we
do
want
to
put
her
in
the
notion
that
every
man
in
the
world
is
a
villain
laying
for
a
chance
to
do
her
harm
there
clean
fellows
a
few
and
it
will
do
sibyl
good
to
meet
that
kind
he
swung
himself
lightly
into
the
saddle
the
woman
smiled
sibyl
could
not
think
that
all
men
are
evil
after
knowing
her
father
and
you
mr
oakley
the
ranger
laughed
as
he
turned
max
toward
the
opening
in
the
cedar
thicket
will
was
what
god
and
nelly
made
him
myra
and
i
if
i
fairly
decent
it
because
mary
took
me
in
hand
in
time
men
are
mostly
what
you
women
make
anyway
i
reckon
do
forget
that
you
and
oakley
are
coming
for
supper
she
called
after
him
no
danger
of
our
forgetting
that
he
answered
adios
and
the
chestnut
loped
easily
out
of
the
yard
myra
willard
kept
her
place
on
the
porch
until
the
sound
of
the
galloping
feet
died
away
down
the
canyon
but
as
she
listened
to
the
vanishing
sound
of
the
ranger
going
her
eyes
were
looking
far
away
as
though
his
words
had
aroused
in
her
heart
memories
of
days
long
past
when
the
last
echo
had
lost
itself
in
the
thin
mountain
air
she
went
into
the
house
standing
before
the
small
mirror
that
served
in
the
rude
almost
furnishings
of
the
house
for
both
herself
and
sibyl
she
studied
the
face
reflected
there
turning
her
head
slowly
as
if
comparing
the
beautiful
unmarked
side
with
the
other
that
was
so
hideously
disfigured
for
some
time
she
stood
there
unflinchingly
giving
herself
to
the
torture
of
this
contemplation
of
her
ruined
loveliness
drinking
to
its
bitter
dregs
the
sorrowful
cup
of
her
secret
memories
until
as
though
she
could
bear
no
more
she
drew
back
her
eyes
wide
with
pain
and
horror
her
marred
features
twisted
grotesquely
in
an
agony
of
mental
suffering
with
a
pitiful
moan
she
sank
upon
her
knees
in
prayer
in
the
earnestness
of
her
spirit
out
of
the
deep
devotion
of
her
love
as
she
prayed
god
for
wisdom
to
guide
the
girl
entrusted
to
her
care
she
spoke
aloud
let
me
not
rob
her
dear
christ
of
love
but
help
me
to
help
her
love
aright
help
me
that
in
my
fear
for
her
i
do
not
turn
her
heart
against
her
mate
when
he
shall
come
help
me
that
i
do
not
so
fill
her
pure
mind
with
doubt
and
distrust
of
all
men
that
she
will
look
for
evil
only
help
me
that
i
do
not
teach
her
to
associate
love
wholly
with
that
which
is
base
and
untrue
grant
o
god
that
her
beautiful
life
may
not
be
marred
by
a
love
that
is
unworthy
as
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
rose
from
her
knees
she
heard
the
voice
of
sibyl
who
was
coming
up
the
old
road
toward
the
cedars
singing
as
she
came
when
sibyl
entered
the
house
a
moment
later
myra
willard
still
agitated
was
bathing
her
face
the
girl
seeing
checked
the
song
upon
her
lips
and
going
to
the
woman
who
in
everything
but
the
ties
of
blood
was
mother
to
her
sought
to
discover
the
reason
for
her
troubled
manner
and
tried
to
soothe
her
with
loving
words
the
woman
held
the
girl
close
in
her
arms
and
looked
into
the
lovely
winsome
face
that
was
so
unmarred
by
vicious
thoughts
of
the
teaching
dear
child
do
you
not
sometimes
hate
the
sight
of
my
ugliness
she
said
it
seems
to
me
you
must
with
her
arms
about
her
companion
neck
sibyl
pressed
her
pure
young
lips
to
those
disfiguring
scars
in
an
impulsive
kiss
foolish
myra
she
cried
you
know
i
love
you
too
well
to
see
anything
but
your
own
beautiful
self
behind
the
scars
to
me
your
face
is
all
like
this
and
she
softly
kissed
in
turn
the
woman
unmarred
cheek
whatever
made
the
marks
i
know
that
they
are
not
dishonorable
so
i
never
think
of
them
at
all
but
see
only
the
beautiful
side
which
is
really
you
you
know
no
answered
myra
willard
gently
my
scars
are
not
dishonorable
but
the
world
does
not
see
with
your
pure
eyes
dear
child
the
world
sees
only
the
ugly
disfigured
side
of
my
face
it
never
looks
at
the
other
side
and
listen
dear
heart
so
the
world
often
sees
dishonor
where
there
is
no
dishonor
it
sees
evil
in
many
things
where
there
is
only
good
yes
returned
the
girl
but
you
have
never
taught
me
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
so
to
me
what
the
world
sees
does
not
matter
pray
that
it
may
never
matter
child
answered
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
earnestly
then
as
they
went
out
to
the
porch
she
asked
did
you
meet
oakley
as
you
were
coming
home
sibyl
laughed
and
colored
with
a
confusion
that
was
new
to
her
as
she
answered
yes
i
did
and
he
scolded
me
about
your
going
unarmed
no
but
he
told
me
about
that
too
i
do
see
why
whenever
a
poor
criminal
escapes
he
always
comes
into
mountains
i
do
like
to
a
gun
unless
i
hunting
but
brian
oakley
did
scold
me
for
that
though
he
knows
i
always
do
as
he
says
he
scolded
because
i
told
you
about
my
going
to
see
king
in
the
spring
glade
she
laughed
conscious
of
the
color
that
was
in
her
cheeks
i
told
him
it
did
matter
whether
i
told
you
or
not
because
he
always
knows
every
single
move
i
make
anyway
why
you
tell
me
dear
asked
the
woman
you
never
kept
anything
from
me
before
i
sure
why
dearest
the
girl
answered
frankly
i
do
know
myself
why
i
did
tell
you
which
myra
willard
knew
was
the
exact
truth
then
sibyl
told
her
everything
about
her
acquaintance
with
the
artist
and
conrad
lagrange
from
the
time
she
first
watched
the
painter
from
the
arbor
in
the
rose
garden
where
she
met
the
novelist
until
that
afternoon
when
she
had
invited
them
to
supper
the
next
day
only
of
her
dancing
before
the
artist
the
girl
did
not
tell
later
in
the
evening
sibyl
saying
that
she
would
sing
myra
to
sleep
took
her
violin
to
the
porch
outside
the
window
and
in
the
dusk
made
soft
music
until
the
woman
troubled
heart
was
calmed
when
the
moon
came
up
from
behind
the
galenas
across
the
canyon
the
girl
tiptoed
into
the
house
to
bend
over
the
sleeping
woman
in
tender
solicitude
with
that
mother
tenderness
belonging
to
all
true
women
she
stooped
and
softly
kissed
the
disfigured
face
upon
the
pillow
at
the
touch
myra
willard
stirred
uneasily
and
the
girl
careful
to
make
no
sound
withdrew
on
the
porch
she
again
took
up
her
violin
as
if
to
play
but
instead
sat
motionless
her
face
turned
down
the
canyon
her
eyes
looking
far
away
then
quickly
she
put
aside
the
instrument
and
as
though
with
sudden
yielding
to
some
inner
impulse
slipped
out
into
the
grassy
yard
and
there
in
the
moon
white
light
with
only
the
mountains
the
trees
and
the
flowers
to
see
she
danced
again
as
she
had
danced
before
the
artist
in
the
glade
with
her
face
turned
down
the
canyon
and
her
arms
outstretched
longingly
toward
the
camp
in
the
sycamores
back
of
the
old
orchard
suddenly
from
the
room
where
myra
willard
slept
came
that
shuddering
cry
the
girl
as
a
deer
ran
into
the
house
kneeling
she
put
her
strong
young
arms
about
the
cowering
trembling
form
on
the
bed
there
there
dear
it
all
right
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
caught
sibyl
hand
impulsively
i
i
was
dreaming
again
she
whispered
and
and
this
time
o
sibyl
this
time
i
dreamed
that
it
was
chapter
xxi
the
last
climb
that
first
visit
of
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
to
the
old
home
of
sibyl
andr√©s
was
the
beginning
of
a
delightful
comradeship
often
in
the
evening
the
two
men
with
czar
went
to
spend
an
hour
in
friendly
intercourse
with
their
neighbors
up
the
canyon
always
they
were
welcomed
by
myra
willard
with
a
quiet
dignity
while
sibyl
was
frankly
delighted
to
have
them
come
always
they
were
invited
with
genuine
hospitality
to
come
again
frequently
brian
oakley
and
perhaps
oakley
would
be
there
when
they
arrived
or
the
ranger
would
come
riding
into
the
yard
before
they
left
at
times
the
canyon
mountain
wall
echoed
the
laughter
of
the
little
company
as
sibyl
and
the
novelist
played
their
fantastical
game
of
words
or
again
the
older
people
would
listen
to
the
blending
voices
of
the
artist
and
the
girl
as
in
the
quiet
hush
of
the
evening
they
sang
together
to
myra
willard
accompaniment
on
the
violin
or
perhaps
sibyl
with
her
face
upturned
to
the
mountain
tops
would
make
for
her
chosen
friends
the
music
of
the
hills
not
infrequently
too
the
girl
would
call
at
the
camp
in
the
sycamore
grove
sometimes
riding
with
the
ranger
sometimes
alone
or
they
would
hear
her
merry
hail
from
the
gate
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
as
she
passed
by
and
sometimes
in
the
morning
she
would
appear
equipped
with
rod
or
gun
or
basket
to
frankly
challenge
aaron
king
to
some
long
ramble
in
the
hills
so
the
days
for
the
young
man
at
the
beginning
of
his
life
work
and
for
the
young
woman
at
the
beginning
of
her
womanhood
passed
up
and
down
the
canyon
along
the
bed
of
the
roaring
clear
creek
from
the
ranger
station
to
the
falls
in
the
quiet
glades
under
the
alders
hung
with
and
wild
grape
beneath
the
on
the
mountains
flanks
or
shoulders
in
dimly
lighted
gulches
among
tall
brakes
and
lilies
or
high
up
on
the
canyon
walls
under
the
dark
and
fragrant
pines
over
all
the
paths
and
trails
familiar
to
her
girlhood
she
led
him
showing
him
every
nook
and
glade
and
glen
teaching
him
to
know
as
he
had
asked
the
mountains
that
she
herself
so
loved
the
time
came
at
last
when
the
two
men
must
return
to
fairlands
with
and
oakley
they
were
spending
the
evening
at
sibyl
home
when
conrad
lagrange
announced
that
they
would
leave
the
mountains
two
days
later
then
said
the
girl
impulsively
king
and
i
are
going
for
one
last
climb
are
we
she
concluded
turning
to
the
artist
aaron
king
laughed
as
he
answered
we
certainly
seem
to
be
headed
that
way
where
are
we
going
we
will
start
early
and
come
back
late
she
returned
which
really
is
all
that
any
one
ought
to
know
about
a
climb
that
is
just
for
the
climb
and
listen
no
rod
no
gun
no
i
fix
a
lunch
watch
out
for
my
convict
warned
the
ranger
he
must
be
getting
mighty
hungry
by
now
early
in
the
morning
they
set
out
crossing
the
canyon
they
climbed
the
oak
knoll
trail
down
which
the
artist
and
conrad
lagrange
had
been
led
by
the
uncanny
wisdom
of
croesus
a
few
weeks
before
to
the
where
the
path
from
below
leads
into
the
trail
under
the
on
a
shelf
cut
in
the
comparatively
easy
slope
of
the
mountain
shoulder
they
paused
for
a
look
over
the
narrow
valley
that
lay
a
thousand
feet
below
across
the
wide
gray
wash
of
the
mountain
torrent
way
with
the
gleaming
thread
of
tumbling
clear
creek
in
its
center
they
could
see
the
white
dots
that
marked
the
camp
back
of
the
old
orchard
and
farther
up
the
stream
could
distinguish
the
little
opening
with
the
cedar
thicket
and
the
giant
sycamores
that
marked
the
spot
where
sibyl
was
born
aaron
king
looking
at
the
girl
recalled
that
day
when
he
and
conrad
lagrange
in
a
spirit
of
venturesome
fun
had
left
the
choice
of
trails
to
the
burro
good
old
croesus
he
said
smiling
she
knew
the
story
of
how
they
had
been
guided
to
their
camping
place
and
laughed
in
return
as
she
answered
he
a
dear
old
burro
is
croesus
and
worthy
of
a
better
name
plutus
would
be
better
suggested
the
artist
because
a
greek
god
is
better
than
a
lydian
king
she
asked
curiously
was
plutus
the
giver
of
wealth
he
returned
yes
well
and
was
he
forced
by
zeus
to
distribute
his
gifts
without
regard
to
the
characters
of
the
recipients
she
laughed
merrily
plutus
or
croesus
i
glad
he
chose
the
oak
knoll
trail
and
so
am
i
answered
the
man
earnestly
leisurely
they
followed
the
trail
that
is
hung
narrow
path
high
upon
the
mountain
wall
invisible
from
the
floor
of
the
canyon
below
at
a
point
where
the
trail
turns
to
round
the
inward
curve
of
one
of
the
small
side
canyons
where
the
pines
grow
dark
and
tall
some
thoughtful
hand
had
laid
a
small
pipe
from
the
large
conduit
tunnel
under
the
trail
to
a
barrel
fixed
on
the
mountainside
below
the
little
path
here
they
stopped
again
and
while
they
loitered
filled
a
small
canteen
with
the
cold
clear
water
from
the
mountain
heart
farther
on
where
the
again
rounds
the
inward
curve
of
the
wall
between
two
mountain
spurs
they
turned
aside
to
follow
the
government
trail
that
leads
to
the
on
the
summit
of
the
galenas
and
then
down
into
the
valley
on
the
other
side
at
the
gap
where
the
galena
trail
crosses
the
they
again
turned
aside
to
make
their
leisure
way
along
the
broad
break
that
lies
in
many
a
fold
and
curve
and
kink
like
a
great
ribbon
on
the
thin
top
of
the
ridge
with
every
step
now
they
were
climbing
midday
found
them
standing
by
a
huge
rock
at
the
edge
of
a
clump
of
pines
on
one
of
the
higher
points
of
the
western
end
of
the
range
here
they
would
have
their
lunch
as
they
sat
in
the
lee
of
the
great
rock
with
the
wind
that
sweeps
the
mountain
tops
singing
in
the
pines
above
their
heads
they
looked
directly
down
upon
the
wide
galena
valley
and
far
across
to
the
spurs
and
slopes
of
the
san
jacintos
beyond
sibyl
keen
eyes
from
childhood
marked
a
railway
train
crawling
down
the
grade
from
san
gorgonio
pass
toward
the
distant
ocean
she
tried
in
vain
to
point
it
out
to
her
companion
but
the
city
eyes
of
the
man
could
not
find
the
tiny
speck
in
the
vast
landscape
that
lay
within
the
range
of
their
vision
the
artist
looked
at
his
watch
the
train
was
the
golden
state
limited
that
had
brought
him
from
the
far
away
east
a
few
months
before
aaron
king
remembered
how
from
the
platform
of
the
observation
car
he
had
looked
up
at
the
mountains
from
which
he
now
looked
down
he
remembered
too
the
woman
into
whose
eyes
he
had
for
the
first
time
looked
that
day
turning
his
face
to
the
west
he
could
distinguish
under
the
haze
of
the
distance
the
dark
squares
of
the
orange
groves
of
fairlands
before
three
days
had
passed
he
would
be
in
his
studio
home
again
and
the
woman
of
the
observation
car
platform
from
distant
fairlands
the
man
turned
his
eyes
to
the
winsome
face
of
his
girl
comrade
on
the
mountain
top
please
she
said
meeting
his
serious
gaze
with
a
smile
of
frank
fellowship
please
what
have
i
done
smiling
he
answered
gravely
i
do
exactly
know
but
you
have
done
something
you
look
so
serious
i
sure
it
must
be
pretty
bad
ca
you
think
what
it
is
he
laughed
i
was
thinking
about
down
there
he
pointed
into
the
haze
of
the
distant
valley
to
the
west
do
she
returned
let
think
about
up
here
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
high
crest
of
the
san
bernardinos
and
the
mountain
peaks
about
them
will
you
let
me
paint
your
portrait
when
we
get
back
to
the
orange
groves
he
asked
i
sure
i
do
know
she
returned
why
do
you
want
to
paint
me
nobody
you
know
but
just
me
that
the
reason
i
want
to
paint
you
he
answered
what
the
reason
because
you
are
you
but
a
portrait
of
me
would
not
help
you
on
your
road
to
fame
she
retorted
he
flinched
perhaps
he
said
that
partly
why
i
want
to
do
it
because
it
wo
help
you
because
it
wo
help
me
on
the
road
to
fame
you
pose
for
me
wo
you
i
sure
i
can
not
say
she
answered
perhaps
please
do
let
talk
about
it
why
not
he
asked
curiously
because
she
answered
seriously
we
have
been
such
good
friends
up
here
in
the
mountains
such
such
comrades
up
here
in
the
hills
with
the
canyon
gates
shut
against
the
world
that
i
do
know
you
are
like
like
brian
oakley
and
like
my
father
used
to
be
and
down
there
she
hesitated
yes
he
said
and
down
there
i
will
be
what
i
do
know
she
answered
wistfully
but
sometimes
i
can
see
you
going
on
and
on
and
on
toward
fame
and
the
rewards
it
will
bring
you
and
you
seem
to
get
farther
and
farther
and
farther
away
from
from
the
mountains
and
our
friendship
until
you
are
so
far
away
that
i
ca
see
you
any
more
at
all
i
do
like
to
lose
my
mountain
friends
you
know
he
smiled
but
no
matter
how
famous
i
might
become
no
matter
what
fame
might
bring
me
i
could
not
forget
you
and
your
mountains
i
would
not
want
you
to
remember
me
she
answered
if
you
were
famous
that
is
i
mean
she
added
hesitatingly
if
you
were
famous
just
because
you
to
be
but
i
know
you
could
never
forget
the
mountains
and
that
would
be
the
trouble
do
you
see
if
you
forget
it
would
not
matter
ask
lagrange
he
knows
for
some
time
aaron
king
sat
without
speaking
looking
about
at
the
world
that
was
so
far
from
that
other
world
the
world
he
had
always
known
the
girl
too
seeming
to
understand
the
thoughts
that
he
himself
perhaps
could
not
have
expressed
was
silent
then
he
said
slowly
i
do
think
that
i
care
for
fame
as
i
did
before
you
taught
me
to
know
the
mountains
it
does
somehow
now
seem
to
matter
so
much
it
the
that
really
matters
after
all
is
it
and
sibyl
andr√©s
smiling
answered
yes
it
the
work
that
really
matters
i
sure
that
be
so
in
the
afternoon
they
went
on
still
following
the
down
to
where
it
is
intersected
by
the
a
mile
from
the
reservoir
on
the
hill
above
the
then
back
to
oak
knoll
again
on
the
trail
all
the
way
a
beautiful
and
walk
the
sun
was
just
touching
the
tops
of
the
western
mountains
when
they
started
down
oak
knoll
the
canyon
below
already
lay
in
the
shadow
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
trail
it
was
twilight
across
the
road
by
a
small
streamlet
a
tributary
to
clear
creek
a
party
of
huntsmen
were
making
ready
to
spend
the
night
the
voices
of
the
men
came
clearly
through
the
gathering
gloom
under
the
trees
they
could
see
the
ruddy
gleam
they
did
not
notice
the
man
who
was
standing
half
hidden
in
the
bushes
beside
the
road
near
the
spot
where
the
trail
opens
into
it
silently
the
man
watched
them
as
they
turned
up
the
road
which
they
would
follow
a
little
way
before
crossing
the
canyon
to
home
fifty
yards
farther
on
they
met
brian
oakley
howdy
you
two
called
the
ranger
cheerily
without
stopping
his
horse
rather
late
ai
you
we
be
there
by
dark
called
the
artist
and
the
ranger
passed
on
at
sound
of
the
mountaineer
voice
the
man
in
the
bushes
drew
quickly
back
the
officer
trained
eyes
caught
the
movement
in
the
brush
and
he
leaned
forward
in
the
saddle
a
moment
later
the
man
reappeared
in
the
road
farther
down
around
the
bend
as
the
ranger
approached
he
was
hailed
by
a
boisterous
hello
brian
better
stop
and
have
a
bite
how
do
you
do
mr
rutlidge
came
the
officer
greeting
as
he
reined
in
his
horse
when
did
you
land
in
the
hills
this
afternoon
answered
the
other
we
just
making
camp
come
and
meet
the
fellows
you
know
some
of
them

returned
brian
oakley
deer
hunt
i
suppose
yes
thought
we
would
be
in
good
time
for
the
opening
of
the
season
by
the
way
do
you
happen
to
know
where
lagrange
and
that
artist
friend
of
his
are
camped
in
that
bunch
of
sycamores
back
of
the
old
orchard
down
there
answered
the
ranger
watching
the
man
face
keenly
i
just
passed
king
up
the
road
a
piece
that
so
i
did
see
him
go
by
returned
the
other
i
think
i
run
over
and
say
to
lagrange
in
the
morning
we
are
only
going
as
far
as
burnt
pine
anyway
keep
your
eyes
open
for
an
escaped
convict
said
the
officer
casually
there
one
ranging
somewhere
in
here
came
in
about
a
month
ago
likely
to
clean
out
your
camp
so
long
perhaps
we
take
him
in
for
you
laughed
the
other
good
night
he
turned
toward
the
under
the
trees
as
the
officer
rode
away
now
what
in
hell
did
that
fellow
want
to
lie
to
me
like
that
for
said
brian
oakley
to
himself
he
must
have
seen
king
and
sibyl
as
they
came
down
the
trail

chapter

shadows
of
coming
events
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
were
idling
in
their
camp
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
when
czar
turned
his
head
quickly
in
a
listening
attitude
with
a
low
growl
that
signified
disapproval
he
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
and
stood
stiffly
erect
gazing
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
orchard
some
one
coming
czar
asked
the
artist
the
dog
answered
with
another
growl
while
the
hair
on
his
neck
bristled
in
anger
some
one
we
do
like
heh
commented
the
novelist
or
he
added
as
if
musing
upon
the
animal
instinct
some
one
we
ought
not
to
like
a
bark
from
czar
greeted
james
rutlidge
who
at
that
moment
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
leading
up
to
their
camp
the
two
men
remembering
the
occasion
of
their
visitor
last
call
at
their
home
in
fairlands
when
he
had
seen
sibyl
in
the
studio
received
the
man
with
courtesy
but
with
little
warmth
czar
continued
to
manifest
his
sentiments
until
rebuked
by
his
master
the
coolness
of
the
reception
however
in
no
way
disconcerted
james
rutlidge
who
on
his
part
rather
overdid
his
assumption
of
pleasure
at
meeting
them
again
explaining
that
he
had
come
with
a
party
of
friends
on
a
hunting
trip
he
told
them
how
he
had
met
brian
oakley
and
so
had
learned
of
their
camp
hidden
behind
the
old
orchard
the
rest
of
his
party
he
said
had
gone
on
up
the
canyon
they
would
stop
at
burnt
pine
on
laurel
creek
where
he
could
easily
join
them
before
night
he
could
not
think
he
declared
of
passing
so
near
without
greeting
his
friends
you
two
certainly
are
expert
when
it
comes
to
finding
snug
quarters
he
commented
searching
the
camp
and
the
immediate
surroundings
with
a
careful
and
ostensibly
an
appreciative
eye
a
thousand
people
might
pass
this
old
deserted
place
without
ever
dreaming
that
you
were
so
ideally
hidden
back
here
as
he
finished
speaking
his
roving
eye
came
to
rest
upon
a
pair
of
gloves
that
sibyl
the
last
time
she
had
called
had
carelessly
left
lying
upon
a
stump
close
by
a
giant
sycamore
where
in
camp
fashion
the
rods
and
creels
and
guns
were
kept
the
artist
had
intended
to
return
the
gloves
the
day
before
together
with
a
book
of
which
the
girl
had
also
forgotten
but
in
his
eagerness
for
the
day
outing
he
had
gone
off
without
them
the
observing
conrad
lagrange
did
not
fail
to
note
that
james
rutlidge
had
seen
the
telltale
gloves
fixing
his
peculiar
eyes
upon
the
visitor
he
asked
abruptly
with
polite
but
purposeful
interest
after
the
health
of
and
taine
and
louise
the
faint
shadow
of
a
suggestive
smile
that
crossed
the
heavy
features
of
james
rutlidge
as
he
turned
his
gaze
from
the
gloves
to
meet
the
look
of
the
novelist
was
maddening
the
old
boy
is
steadily
going
down
he
said
without
feeling
the
doctors
tell
me
that
he
ca
last
through
the
winter
it
be
a
relief
to
everybody
when
he
goes
taine
is
well
and
beautiful
as
always
remarkable
how
she
keeps
up
appearances
considering
her
serious
condition
louise
is
quite
as
usual
they
will
all
be
back
in
fairlands
in
another
month
they
sent
regards
to
you
both
in
case
i
should
run
across
you
the
two
men
made
the
usual
conventional
replies
adding
that
they
were
returning
to
fairlands
the
next
day
so
soon
exclaimed
their
visitor
with
another
meaning
smile
i
see
how
you
can
think
of
leaving
your
really
delightful
retreat
i
understand
you
have
such
charming
neighbors
too
perhaps
though
they
are
also
returning
to
the
orange
groves
and
roses
aaron
king
face
flushed
hotly
and
he
was
about
to
reply
with
vigor
to
the
sneering
words
when
conrad
lagrange
silenced
him
with
a
quick
look
ignoring
the
reference
to
their
neighbors
the
novelist
replied
suavely
that
they
felt
they
must
return
to
civilization
as
some
matters
in
connection
with
the
new
edition
of
his
last
novel
demanded
his
attention
and
the
artist
wished
to
get
back
to
his
studio
and
to
his
work
really
urged
rutlidge
mockingly
you
ought
not
to
go
down
now
the
deer
season
opens
in
two
days
why
not
join
our
party
for
a
hunt
we
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
they
were
coolly
thanking
him
for
the
invitation
that
from
the
tone
in
which
it
was
given
was
so
evidently
not
meant
when
czar
with
a
joyful
bark
dashed
away
through
the
grove
a
moment
and
a
clear
girlish
voice
called
from
among
the
trees
that
bordered
the
cienaga
it
was
the
signal
that
sibyl
always
gave
when
she
approached
their
camp
james
rutlidge
broke
into
a
low
laugh
while
sibyl
friends
looked
at
each
other
in
angry
consternation
as
the
girl
following
her
hail
and
accompanied
by
the
delighted
dog
appeared
in
full
view
her
in
hand
her
creel
swung
over
her
shoulder
the
girl
embarrassment
when
too
late
she
saw
and
recognized
their
visitor
was
pitiful
as
she
came
slowly
forward
too
confused
to
retreat
rutlidge
started
to
laugh
again
but
aaron
king
with
an
emphasis
that
checked
the
man
mirth
said
in
a
low
tone
stop
that
be
careful
as
he
spoke
the
artist
arose
and
with
conrad
lagrange
went
forward
to
greet
sibyl
in
as
nearly
as
they
could
their
customary
manner
formally
rutlidge
was
presented
to
the
girl
and
under
the
threatening
eyes
of
the
painter
greeted
her
with
no
hint
of
rudeness
in
his
voice
or
manner
saying
courteously
with
a
smile
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
miss
andr√©s
acquaintance
for
let
me
see
three
years
now
is
it
not
he
appealed
to
her
directly
it
was
three
years
ago
that
i
first
saw
you
sir
she
returned
coolly
it
was
my
first
trip
into
the
mountains
i
remember
said
rutlidge
easily
i
met
you
at
brian
oakley
home
without
replying
she
turned
to
aaron
king
appealingly
i
i
left
my
gloves
and
i
was
going
fishing
and
called
to
get
them
the
artist
gave
her
the
articles
with
a
word
of
regret
for
having
so
carelessly
forgotten
to
return
them
to
her
with
a
simple
to
her
two
friends
but
without
even
a
glance
toward
their
caller
she
went
back
up
the
canyon
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
when
the
girl
had
disappeared
among
the
trees
james
rutlidge
said
with
his
meaning
smile
really
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
dropping
in
so
unexpectedly
i
conrad
lagrange
interrupted
him
curtly
no
apology
is
due
sir
no
returned
rutlidge
with
a
rising
inflection
and
a
drawling
note
in
his
voice
that
was
almost
too
much
for
the
others
i
really
must
be
going
anyway
he
continued
my
party
will
be
some
distance
ahead
sure
you
would
care
to
join
us
thanks
sorry
but
we
can
not
this
time
good
of
you
to
ask
us
came
from
aaron
king
and
the
novelist
ca
say
that
i
blame
you
their
caller
returned
the
fishing
used
to
be
fine
in
this
neighborhood
you
must
have
had
some
delightful
sport
do
blame
you
in
the
least
for
not
joining
our
stag
party
delightful
young
woman
that
miss
andr√©s
charming
companion
either
in
the
mountains
or
in
civilization
see
you
in
fairlands
later
when
he
was
out
of
hearing
the
two
men
relieved
their
feelings
in
language
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
not
to
put
in
print
and
the
worst
of
it
is
remarked
the
novelist
it
so
damned
dangerous
to
deny
something
that
does
not
exist
or
make
explanations
in
answer
to
charges
that
are
not
put
into
words
i
could
scarcely
refrain
from
kicking
the
beast
down
the
hill
said
aaron
king
savagely
which
the
other
returned
would
have
complicated
matters
exceedingly
and
would
have
accomplished
nothing
at
all
for
the
girl
sake
store
your
wrath
against
the
day
of
judgment
which
if
i
read
the
signs
aright
is
sure
to
come
when
sibyl
andr√©s
went
down
the
canyon
to
the
camp
in
the
sycamores
that
morning
the
world
to
her
was
very
bright
her
heart
sang
with
joyous
freedom
amid
the
scenes
that
she
so
loved
and
happy
as
when
in
the
days
of
her
girlhood
she
had
gone
to
visit
the
spring
glade
she
still
was
conscious
of
a
deeper
joy
than
in
her
girlhood
she
had
ever
known
when
she
returned
again
up
the
canyon
all
the
brightness
of
her
day
was
gone
her
heart
was
heavy
with
foreboding
fear
she
was
oppressed
with
a
dread
of
some
impending
evil
which
she
could
not
understand
at
every
sound
in
the
mountain
she
started
time
and
again
as
if
expecting
pursuit
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
poised
like
a
creature
of
the
woods
ready
for
instant
flight
so
without
pausing
to
cast
for
trout
or
even
to
go
down
to
the
stream
she
returned
home
where
myra
willard
seeing
her
come
so
early
and
empty
handed
wondered
but
to
the
woman
question
the
girl
only
answered
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
that
after
recovering
her
gloves
and
at
the
camp
of
their
friends
she
had
decided
to
come
home
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
knowing
that
aaron
king
was
leaving
the
hills
the
next
day
thought
that
she
understood
the
girl
mood
and
wisely
made
no
comment
the
artist
and
conrad
lagrange
went
to
spend
their
last
evening
in
the
hills
with
their
friends
brian
oakley
too
dropped
in
but
neither
of
the
three
men
mentioned
the
name
of
james
rutlidge
in
the
presence
of
the
women
while
sibyl
was
apparently
again
her
own
bright
and
happy
self
carrying
on
a
fanciful
play
of
words
with
the
novelist
singing
with
the
artist
and
making
music
for
them
all
with
her
violin
but
before
the
evening
was
over
conrad
lagrange
found
an
opportunity
to
tell
the
ranger
of
the
incident
of
the
morning
and
of
the
construction
that
james
rutlidge
had
evidently
put
upon
sibyl
call
at
the
camp
brian
oakley
thinking
of
the
night
before
and
how
the
man
must
have
seen
the
artist
and
the
girl
coming
down
the
oak
knoll
trail
in
the
twilight
swore
softly
under
his
breath
chapter
xxiii
outside
the
canyon
gates
again
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
determined
to
go
back
from
the
mountains
the
way
they
had
come
said
the
novelist
it
is
as
unseemly
to
rush
from
an
audience
with
the
gods
as
it
is
to
enter
their
presence
irreverently
to
which
the
artist
answered
laughing
even
criminals
under
sentence
have
at
least
the
privilege
of
going
to
their
prisons
reluctantly
so
they
went
down
from
the
mountains
reverently
and
reluctantly
yee
kee
with
the
more
elaborate
equipment
of
the
camp
was
sent
on
ahead
by
wagon
the
two
men
with
croesus
packed
for
a
one
night
halt
and
czar
would
follow
when
all
was
ready
and
they
could
neither
of
them
invent
any
more
excuses
for
lingering
conrad
lagrange
gave
the
word
to
the
burro
and
they
set
out
down
the
little
slope
of
grassy
land
across
the
tiny
stream
from
the
cienaga
around
the
lower
end
of
the
old
orchard
by
the
ancient
road
even
czar
went
slowly
with
head
as
if
regretful
at
leaving
the
mountains
that
he
too
in
his
dog
way
loved
at
the
gate
aaron
king
asked
the
novelist
to
go
on
saying
that
he
would
soon
overtake
him
it
was
possible
he
said
that
he
might
have
left
something
in
the
spring
glade
he
thought
he
had
better
make
sure
conrad
lagrange
assenting
went
through
the
gate
and
down
the
road
with
the
members
of
the
party
and
czar
must
have
thought
that
there
was
something
very
funny
about
old
croesus
that
morning
from
the
way
his
master
laughed
when
they
were
safely
around
the
first
turn
there
was
of
course
no
material
thing
in
the
spring
glade
that
the
artist
wanted
knew
that
quite
as
well
as
his
laughing
friend
under
the
mistletoe
oak
at
the
top
of
the
bank
he
paused
hesitating
as
one
will
often
pause
when
about
to
enter
a
sacred
building
softly
he
pushed
open
the
old
gate
as
he
might
have
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
church
slowly
reverently
he
went
down
the
path
baring
his
head
as
he
went
he
did
not
search
for
anything
that
he
might
have
left
he
simply
stood
for
a
few
minutes
under
the
alders
that
were
so
marked
by
the
loving
hands
of
long
ago
men
and
maidens
beside
the
mint
bordered
spring
with
the
scattered
stones
of
that
old
foundation
where
through
the
screen
of
boughs
and
vines
and
the
sunlight
fell
as
through
the
traceries
of
a
cathedral
window
and
the
low
deep
tones
of
the
mountain
waters
came
like
the
music
of
a
great
organ
it
is
likely
that
aaron
king
himself
could
not
at
that
time
have
told
why
as
he
was
leaving
the
hills
he
had
paused
to
visit
once
more
the
spot
where
sibyl
andr√©s
had
brought
to
him
her
three
gifts
from
the
mountains
where
in
her
pure
innocence
she
had
danced
before
him
the
dance
of
the
mating
butterflies
and
where
with
the
music
of
her
violin
she
had
saved
their
friendship
from
the
perils
that
threatened
it
lifting
their
intimate
comradeship
into
the
pure
atmosphere
of
the
higher
levels
even
as
she
had
shown
him
the
trails
that
lead
from
the
lower
canyon
to
the
summits
and
peaks
of
the
encircling
mountain
walls
but
when
he
rejoined
his
friend
there
was
something
in
his
face
that
prevented
the
novelist
from
making
any
comment
in
a
laughing
vein
as
the
two
men
passed
outward
through
the
canyon
gates
and
looking
backward
as
they
went
saw
those
mighty
doors
close
silently
behind
them
the
artist
was
moved
by
emotions
that
were
strange
and
new
to
the
man
who
two
months
before
had
watched
those
gates
open
to
receive
him
this
too
is
true
as
that
man
then
knew
but
did
not
know
the
mountains
so
this
man
now
knew
yet
still
did
not
know
himself
where
the
road
crosses
for
the
last
time
the
tumbling
stream
from
the
heart
of
the
hills
they
halted
and
for
one
night
slept
again
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
the
next
day
they
arrived
at
their
little
home
in
the
orange
grove
to
aaron
king
it
seemed
that
they
had
been
away
for
years
when
the
traces
of
their
days
upon
the
road
had
been
removed
and
they
were
garbed
again
in
the
conventional
costume
of
the
world
when
their
outfit
had
been
put
away
and
a
home
found
for
patient
croesus
the
artist
went
to
his
studio
the
afternoon
passed
and
yee
kee
called
dinner
but
aaron
king
did
not
come
then
conrad
lagrange
went
to
find
him
softly
the
older
man
pushed
open
the
studio
door
to
see
the
painter
sitting
before
the
portrait
of
taine
with
the
package
of
his
letters
in
his
hand
without
a
sound
the
novelist
withdrew
leaving
the
door
ajar
going
to
the
corner
of
the
house
he
whistled
low
and
in
answer
czar
come
bounding
to
him
from
the
porch
go
find
aaron
czar
said
the
man
pointing
toward
the
studio
go
find
aaron
obediently
with
waving
tail
the
dog
trotted
off
and
pushing
open
the
door
entered
the
room
followed
a
few
moments
later
by
his
master
conrad
lagrange
smiled
as
he
saw
that
the
easel
was
without
a
canvas
the
portrait
of
taine
was
turned
to
the
wall
chapter
xxiv
james
rutlidge
makes
a
mistake
when
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
had
said
to
their
friends
at
sibyl
andr√©s
home
that
evening
and
had
returned
to
spend
their
last
night
at
the
camp
in
the
sycamores
the
girl
mood
was
again
the
mood
of
one
oppressed
by
a
haunting
foreboding
fear
sibyl
could
not
have
expressed
or
even
to
herself
defined
her
fear
she
only
knew
that
in
the
presence
of
james
rutlidge
she
was
frightened
she
had
tried
many
times
to
overcome
her
strange
antipathy
for
rutlidge
until
that
day
in
the
studio
had
never
been
other
than
kind
and
courteous
in
his
persistent
efforts
to
win
her
friendship
perhaps
it
was
the
impression
left
by
the
memory
of
myra
willard
manner
at
the
time
of
their
first
meeting
with
him
three
years
before
in
brian
oakley
home
perhaps
it
was
because
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
had
so
often
warned
her
against
permitting
her
slight
acquaintance
with
rutlidge
to
develop
perhaps
it
was
something
else
some
instinct
possible
only
to
one
of
her
pure
unspoiled
nature
whatever
it
was
the
mountain
girl
who
was
so
naturally
unafraid
feared
this
man
who
in
his
own
world
was
an
acknowledged
authority
upon
matters
of
the
highest
spiritual
and
moral
significance
that
night
she
slept
but
little
with
the
morning
every
nerve
demanded
action
action
she
felt
as
though
if
she
could
not
spend
herself
in
physical
exertion
she
would
go
mad
taking
her
lunch
and
telling
her
companion
that
she
was
going
for
a
good
full
day
with
the
trout
she
was
starting
off
when
the
woman
called
her
back
you
have
forgotten
oakley
warning
dear
you
are
not
to
go
unarmed
you
know
oh
bother
that
old
convict
brian
oakley
is
so
worried
about
cried
the
girl
i
do
like
to
carry
a
gun
when
i
am
fishing
it
only
an
extra
load
but
as
she
spoke
she
went
back
to
the
porch
where
myra
willard
handed
her
a
belt
of
cartridges
with
a
serviceable
colt
revolver
in
the
holster
there
was
no
hint
of
awkwardness
when
the
girl
buckled
the
belt
about
her
waist
and
settled
the
holster
in
its
place
at
her
hip
you
will
be
careful
wo
you
dear
said
the
woman
earnestly
lifting
her
face
for
another
kiss
the
girl
answered
of
course
dear
mother

then
with
a
laugh
i
agree
to
shoot
the
first
man
i
meet
and
identify
him
afterwards
if
it
will
make
you
easier
in
your
mind
you
wo
worry
will
you
myra
willard
smiled
not
a
bit
child
i
know
how
brian
oakley
loves
you
and
he
says
that
he
has
no
fear
for
you
if
you
are
armed
he
takes
great
chances
himself
that
man
but
he
would
send
us
back
to
fairlands
in
a
minute
if
he
thought
you
were
in
any
danger
in
your
rambles
beside
the
roaring
clear
creek
sibyl
seated
self
upon
a
great
boulder
her
rod
and
flies
neglected
apparently
unmindful
of
the
purpose
that
had
brought
her
to
the
stream
her
eyes
were
not
upon
the
swirling
pool
at
her
feet
but
were
lifted
to
a
spot
a
thousand
feet
up
on
oak
knoll
where
she
knew
the
trail
lay
and
where
croesus
had
made
the
momentous
decision
that
had
resulted
in
her
comradeship
with
aaron
king
following
the
canyon
wall
with
her
eyes
as
though
in
her
mind
she
walked
the
path
from
oak
knoll
to
the
a
mile
from
the
reservoir
her
gaze
then
traced
the
crest
of
the
galenas
resting
finally
upon
that
clump
of
pines
high
up
on
the
point
that
was
so
clearly
marked
against
the
sky
once
she
laid
aside
her
rod
and
slipped
the
creel
from
her
shoulder
but
even
as
she
set
out
she
hesitated
and
turned
back
resolutely
taking
up
her
again
as
though
angry
with
herself
for
her
state
of
mind
she
was
determined
to
indulge
no
longer
her
mood
of
indecision
but
the
fishing
did
not
go
well
to
properly
cast
a
thoughts
must
be
upon
the
art
a
preoccupied
mind
and
wandering
attention
tends
to
a
tangled
line
a
snarled
leader
and
all
sorts
of
aggravating
complications
sibyl
usually
so
skillful
at
this
most
delicate
of
sports
was
as
inaccurate
and
awkward
this
day
as
the
merest
tyro
the
many
pools
and
falls
and
swirling
eddies
of
clear
creek
held
for
her
now
memories
more
attractive
by
far
than
the
wary
trout
they
sheltered
the
familiar
spots
she
had
known
since
childhood
were
haunted
by
a
something
that
made
them
seem
new
and
strange
at
last
thoroughly
angry
with
her
inability
to
control
her
mood
and
half
ashamed
of
the
thoughts
that
forced
themselves
so
insistently
upon
her
with
her
nerves
and
muscles
craving
the
action
that
would
bring
the
relief
of
physical
weariness
she
determined
to
leave
the
more
familiar
ground
for
the
higher
and
less
frequented
waters
of
fern
creek
climbing
out
of
the
canyon
by
the
steep
almost
trail
on
the
san
bernardino
side
she
walked
hard
and
fast
to
reach
lone
cabin
by
noon
but
before
she
had
finished
her
lunch
she
decided
not
to
fish
there
after
all
but
to
go
on
over
the
still
harder
trail
to
burnt
pine
on
laurel
creek
and
returning
to
the
lower
canyon
by
the
laurel
trail
to
work
down
clear
creek
on
the
way
to
her
home
in
the
late
afternoon
and
twilight
the
trail
up
the
almost
precipitous
wall
of
the
gorge
at
lone
cabin
and
over
the
mountain
spur
to
laurel
creek
is
one
that
calls
for
a
clear
head
and
a
sure
foot
it
is
not
a
path
for
the
city
bred
to
essay
save
with
the
ready
arm
of
a
guide
but
the
muscles
and
nerves
of
sibyl
andr√©s
gloried
in
the
task
the
mountain
girl
enjoyed
the
climb
from
which
her
city
sisters
would
have
drawn
back
in
trembling
fear
once
at
a
point
perhaps
of
the
height
to
the
top
she
halted
her
ear
had
caught
a
slight
noise
above
her
head
as
a
few
pebbles
rolled
down
the
almost
perpendicular
face
of
the
wall
and
bounded
from
the
trail
where
she
stood
into
the
depths
below
for
a
few
minutes
the
girl
on
the
little
path
that
was
scarcely
wider
than
the
span
of
her
two
hands
was
as
motionless
and
as
silent
as
the
cliff
itself
while
with
her
face
turned
upward
she
searched
with
keen
eyes
the
rim
of
the
gorge
her
free
right
hand
resting
upon
the
butt
of
the
revolver
at
her
hip
then
she
went
on
not
timidly
but
neither
carelessly
not
in
the
least
frightened
but
still
knowing
that
the
spot
was
far
from
the
more
frequented
paths
with
experienced
care
as
her
head
and
shoulders
came
above
the
rim
she
paused
again
to
search
with
careful
eyes
the
vicinity
of
the
trail
that
from
this
point
leads
for
a
little
way
down
the
ridge
of
the
spur
and
then
by
easier
stages
around
the
shoulder
and
the
flank
of
the
mountain
to
burnt
pine
camp
when
no
living
object
met
her
eye
and
she
could
hear
no
sound
save
the
lonely
wind
in
the
pines
and
the
faint
murmur
of
the
stream
in
the
gorge
below
she
took
the
few
steps
that
yet
remained
of
the
climb
and
seated
herself
for
a
moment
rest
some
small
animal
she
told
herself
a
squirrel
or
a
perhaps
frightened
at
her
approach
and
scurrying
hastily
to
cover
had
dislodged
the
pebbles
with
the
slight
noise
that
she
had
heard
from
where
she
sat
with
her
back
against
the
trunk
of
a
great
pine
she
could
see
far
below
and
beyond
the
immediate
spurs
and
shoulders
of
the
range
on
the
farther
side
of
the
gorge
out
of
which
she
had
just
come
the
lower
end
of
clear
creek
canyon
and
miles
away
under
the
blue
haze
of
the
distance
the
dark
squares
of
the
orange
groves
of
fairlands
somewhere
between
those
canyon
gates
and
the
little
city
in
the
orange
groves
the
girl
knew
that
aaron
king
and
his
friend
were
making
their
way
back
to
the
world
of
men
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
distant
scene
as
if
striving
for
a
wholly
impossible
strength
of
vision
to
mark
the
tiny
moving
spots
that
she
knew
were
there
the
girl
upon
the
high
rim
of
the
wild
and
lonely
mountain
gorge
was
lost
to
her
surroundings
in
an
effort
as
vain
to
see
her
comrade
of
the
weeks
just
past
in
the
years
that
were
to
come
would
the
friendship
born
in
the
hills
endure
in
the
world
beyond
the
canyon
gates
could
it
endure
away
from
those
scenes
that
had
given
it
birth
was
it
possible
for
a
fellowship
established
in
the
free
atmosphere
of
the
mountains
to
live
in
the
lower
altitude
of
fairlands
sibyl
andr√©s
as
she
sat
there
alone
in
the
hills
she
loved
in
her
heart
of
hearts
answered
her
own
questions
no
but
still
she
searched
the
years
to
come
even
as
her
eyes
so
futilely
searched
the
distant
landscape
beyond
the
mighty
gates
that
seemed
now
to
shut
her
in
from
that
world
to
which
aaron
king
was
returning
the
girl
was
aroused
from
her
abstraction
by
a
sound
behind
her
and
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
tree
against
which
she
was
leaning
in
a
flash
she
was
on
her
feet
james
rutlidge
stood
a
few
steps
away
he
had
been
approaching
her
as
she
sat
under
the
tree
but
when
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
faced
him
he
halted
lifting
his
hat
he
greeted
her
with
easy
assurance
a
confident
triumphant
smile
upon
his
heavy
features
and
trembling
the
mountain
girl
who
a
few
moments
before
had
been
so
unafraid
stood
shrinking
before
this
cultured
representative
of
the
arts
returning
his
salutation
she
was
starting
hurriedly
away
down
the
trail
when
he
said
wait
why
be
in
such
a
hurry
as
if
against
her
will
she
paused
it
is
growing
late
she
faltered
i
must
go
he
laughed
i
will
go
with
you
presently
do
be
afraid
coming
forward
with
an
air
of
making
himself
very
much
at
home
he
placed
his
rifle
against
the
tree
where
she
had
been
sitting
then
as
if
to
calm
her
fears
he
continued
i
am
camped
at
burnt
pine
with
a
party
of
friends
i
was
up
here
looking
for
deer
sign
when
i
noticed
you
below
at
the
cabin
there
i
was
just
starting
down
to
you
when
i
saw
that
you
were
going
to
come
up
so
i
waited
beautiful
spot
this
do
you
think
so
out
of
the
way
too
just
the
place
for
a
quiet
little
visit
as
the
man
spoke
he
was
eyeing
her
in
a
way
that
only
served
to
confuse
and
frighten
her
the
more
murmuring
some
inaudible
reply
she
again
started
to
go
but
again
he
said
peremptorily
wait
and
again
as
if
against
her
will
she
paused
if
you
have
no
scruples
about
wandering
over
the
mountains
alone
with
that
artist
fellow
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
hesitate
to
favor
me
the
man
words
were
undoubtedly
prompted
by
what
he
firmly
believed
to
be
the
nature
of
the
relation
between
the
girl
and
aaron
king
a
belief
for
which
he
had
to
his
mind
sufficient
evidence
but
sibyl
had
no
understanding
of
his
meaning
in
the
innocence
of
her
pure
mind
the
purport
of
his
words
was
utterly
lost
her
very
fear
of
the
man
was
not
a
reasoning
fear
but
the
instinctive
shrinking
of
a
nature
that
had
never
felt
the
unclean
touch
of
the
world
in
which
james
rutlidge
habitually
moved
it
was
this
very
unreasoning
element
in
her
emotions
that
made
her
always
so
embarrassed
in
the
man
presence
it
was
because
she
did
not
understand
her
fear
of
him
that
the
girl
usually
so
capable
of
taking
her
own
part
was
in
his
presence
so
helpless
james
rutlidge
by
the
intellectual
moral
and
physical
atmosphere
in
which
he
lived
was
made
wholly
incapable
of
understanding
the
nature
of
sibyl
andr√©s
secure
in
the
convictions
of
his
own
debased
mind
as
to
her
relation
to
the
artist
and
misconstruing
her
very
manner
in
his
presence
he
was
not
long
in
putting
his
proposal
into
words
that
she
could
not
fail
to
understand
when
she
grasp
his
meaning
her
fears
and
her
trembling
nervousness
gave
place
to
courageous
indignation
and
righteous
anger
that
found
expression
in
scathing
words
of
denunciation
the
man
still
could
not
understand
the
truth
of
the
situation
to
him
there
was
nothing
more
in
her
refusal
than
her
preference
for
the
artist
that
this
young
woman
to
him
an
unschooled
girl
of
the
hills
whom
he
had
so
long
marked
as
his
own
should
give
herself
to
another
and
so
scornfully
turn
from
him
was
an
affront
that
he
could
not
brook
the
very
vigor
of
her
wrath
as
she
stood
before
him
her
eyes
bright
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
beautiful
body
quivering
with
the
vehemence
of
her
passionate
outburst
only
served
to
fan
the
flame
of
his
desire
while
her
stinging
words
provoked
his
bestial
mind
to
an
rage
with
a
muttered
oath
and
a
threat
he
started
toward
her
but
the
woman
who
faced
him
now
with
full
understanding
was
very
different
from
the
timid
frightened
girl
who
had
not
at
first
understood
with
a
movement
that
was
the
result
of
brian
careful
training
her
hand
dropped
to
her
hip
and
was
raised
again
james
rutlidge
stopped
as
though
against
an
iron
bar
in
the
blue
eyes
that
looked
at
him
now
over
the
dark
barrel
of
the
revolver
he
read
no
uncertainty
of
purpose
the
small
hand
that
had
drawn
the
weapon
with
such
ready
swiftness
was
as
steady
as
though
at
target
practice
instinctively
the
man
half
turned
throwing
up
his
arm
as
if
to
shield
his
face
from
a
menacing
blow
for
god
sake
he
gasped
put
that
down
in
truth
james
rutlidge
was
nearer
death
at
that
instant
than
he
had
ever
been
before
drawing
back
a
few
fearful
paces
his
hands
still
uplifted
he
said
again
put
it
down
i
tell
you
do
you
see
i
not
going
to
touch
you
you
are
crazy
you
might
kill
me
her
words
came
cold
and
collected
expressing
together
with
her
calm
manner
perfect
if
you
can
give
any
good
reason
why
i
should
not
kill
you
i
will
let
you
go
the
man
was
carefully
drawing
backward
toward
the
tree
against
which
he
had
placed
his
rifle
she
watched
him
with
a
disconcerting
smile
you
may
as
well
stop
now
she
said
in
those
even
composed
tones
i
shall
fire
the
moment
you
are
within
reach
of
your
gun
he
halted
with
a
gesture
of
despair
his
face
livid
with
fear
at
her
apparent
indecision
as
to
his
fate
presently
she
spoke
again
do
worry
i
not
going
to
kill
you
unless
you
force
me
to
which
i
assure
you
will
not
be
at
all
difficult
for
you
to
do
move
down
the
trail
until
i
tell
you
to
stop
she
indicated
the
direction
along
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
spur
he
obeyed
that
will
do
she
said
when
he
was
some
twenty
paces
away
he
stopped
turning
to
face
her
again
picking
up
his
winchester
she
skillfully
and
rapidly
threw
all
of
the
shells
out
of
the
magazine
then
covering
him
again
with
her
own
weapon
she
went
a
few
steps
closer
and
threw
the
empty
rifle
at
his
feet
now
she
said
put
that
gun
over
your
left
shoulder
and
go
on
ahead
of
me
down
the
trail
if
you
try
to
dodge
or
run
or
if
you
change
the
position
of
your
rifle
i
kill
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
i
going
to
take
you
down
to
your
camp
at
burnt
pine
james
rutlidge
pale
with
rage
and
shame
stood
still
you
may
as
well
kill
me
he
said
i
will
never
go
into
camp
this
way
do
be
uneasy
she
returned
i
am
no
more
anxious
for
the
world
to
know
of
this
than
you
are
do
as
i
say
when
we
come
within
sight
of
your
camp
or
if
we
meet
any
one
i
will
put
up
my
gun
and
we
will
go
on
together
that
why
i
am
permitting
you
to
carry
your
rifle
so
they
went
down
the
mountainside
the
man
with
his
empty
rifle
over
his
shoulder
the
girl
following
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
with
ready
weapon
when
they
had
come
within
sight
of
the
camp
james
rutlidge
said
some
one
there
i
see
returned
sibyl
slipping
her
gun
in
its
holster
and
stepping
forward
beside
her
companion
and
there
was
a
note
of
glad
relief
in
her
voice
for
it
was
brian
oakley
who
was
bending
over
the
come
she
continued
to
her
companion
and
act
as
though
nothing
had
happened
the
ranger
on
his
way
down
from
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
san
gorgonio
had
stopped
at
the
hunters
camp
for
a
belated
dinner
finding
no
one
at
home
he
had
started
a
fire
and
had
helped
himself
to
coffee
and
bacon
he
was
just
concluding
his
appropriated
meal
when
sibyl
and
james
rutlidge
arrived
in
a
few
words
the
girl
explained
to
her
friend
that
she
was
on
her
way
over
the
trail
from
lone
cabin
and
had
accidentally
met
rutlidge
who
had
accompanied
her
as
far
as
the
camp
james
rutlidge
had
little
to
say
beyond
assuring
the
ranger
of
his
welcome
and
very
soon
the
officer
and
the
girl
set
out
on
their
way
down
the
laurel
trail
to
clear
creek
canyon
as
they
went
sibyl
old
friend
asked
not
a
few
questions
about
her
meeting
with
james
rutlidge
but
the
girl
walking
ahead
in
the
narrow
trail
evaded
him
and
was
glad
that
he
could
not
see
her
face
sibyl
had
spoken
the
literal
truth
when
she
said
to
rutlidge
that
she
did
not
want
any
one
to
know
of
the
incident
she
felt
ashamed
and
humiliated
at
the
thought
of
telling
even
her
father
old
comrade
and
friend
she
knew
brian
oakley
too
well
to
have
any
doubts
as
to
what
would
happen
if
he
knew
how
the
man
had
approached
her
and
she
shrank
from
the
inevitable
outcome
she
wished
only
to
forget
the
whole
affair
and
as
quickly
as
possible
turned
the
conversation
into
other
and
safer
channels
the
ranger
could
not
stop
at
the
house
with
her
but
must
go
on
down
the
canyon
to
the
station
so
the
girl
returned
to
myra
willard
alone
and
to
the
woman
surprise
for
the
second
time
with
an
empty
creel
sibyl
explained
her
failure
to
bring
home
a
catch
of
trout
with
the
simple
statement
that
she
had
not
fished
and
then
to
her
amazement
burst
into
tears
begging
to
return
at
once
to
their
little
home
in
fairlands
myra
willard
thought
that
she
understood
better
than
the
girl
herself
why
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
sibyl
wished
to
leave
the
mountains
perhaps
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
was
right
chapter
xxv
on
the
trail
james
rutlidge
spent
the
day
following
his
experience
with
sibyl
andr√©s
in
camp
his
companions
very
quickly
felt
his
sullen
ugly
mood
and
left
him
to
his
own
thoughts
the
manner
in
which
sibyl
received
his
advances
had
in
no
way
changed
the
man
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
her
relation
to
aaron
king
to
one
of
james
rutlidge
type
schooled
in
the
intellectual
moral
and
esthetic
tenets
of
his
class
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
the
companionship
of
the
artist
and
the
girl
in
any
other
light
if
he
had
even
considered
the
possibility
of
a
clean
pure
comradeship
existing
between
them
under
all
the
circumstances
of
their
friendship
as
he
had
seen
them
in
the
studio
on
the
trail
at
dusk
and
in
the
artist
camp
he
would
have
answered
himself
that
aaron
king
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
fail
to
take
advantage
of
his
opportunities
the
humiliation
of
his
pride
and
his
rage
at
being
so
ignominiously
checked
by
the
girl
whom
he
had
so
long
endeavored
to
win
served
only
to
increase
his
desire
for
her
sibyl
resolute
spirit
and
vigorous
beauty
when
aroused
by
him
together
with
her
unexpected
opposition
to
his
advances
were
as
fuel
to
the
flame
of
his
passion
his
day
of
sullen
brooding
over
the
matter
did
not
improve
his
temper
and
the
next
morning
his
friends
were
relieved
to
see
him
setting
out
alone
with
rifle
and
and
lunch
ostensibly
starting
in
the
direction
of
the
upper
laurel
creek
country
he
doubled
back
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
of
camp
and
took
the
trail
leading
down
to
clear
creek
canyon
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
man
had
any
definite
purpose
in
mind
he
was
simply
yielding
in
a
purposeless
way
to
his
mood
which
for
the
time
being
could
find
no
other
expression
the
remote
chance
that
some
opportunity
looking
toward
his
desire
might
present
itself
led
him
to
seek
the
scenes
where
such
an
opportunity
would
be
most
likely
to
occur
crossing
the
canyon
above
the
company
headwork
he
came
into
the
trail
at
a
point
a
little
back
from
the
main
wagon
road
and
an
hour
later
reached
the
place
on
oak
knoll
where
the
government
trail
leads
down
into
the
canyon
below
and
where
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
had
committed
themselves
to
the
judgment
of
croesus
here
he
left
the
trail
and
climbed
to
a
point
on
a
spur
of
the
mountain
from
which
he
could
see
the
path
for
some
distance
on
either
side
and
below
and
from
which
his
view
of
the
narrow
valley
was
unobstructed
comfortably
seated
with
his
back
against
a
rock
he
adjusted
his
and
trained
it
upon
the
little
spot
of
open
green
marked
by
the
giant
sycamores
the
dark
line
of
cedars
and
the
half
hidden
house
where
he
knew
that
sibyl
andr√©s
and
myra
willard
were
living
no
sooner
had
he
focused
the
powerful
glass
upon
the
scene
that
so
interested
him
than
he
uttered
a
low
exclamation
the
two
women
surrounded
by
their
luggage
and
camp
equipment
were
sitting
on
the
porch
with
brian
oakley
waiting
evidently
for
the
wagon
that
was
crossing
the
creek
toward
the
house
it
was
clear
to
the
man
on
the
mountainside
that
sibyl
andr√©s
and
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
were
returning
to
fairlands
for
some
time
james
rutlidge
sat
watching
with
absorbing
interest
the
unconscious
people
in
the
canyon
below
once
he
turned
for
a
brief
glance
at
the
grove
of
sycamores
behind
the
old
orchard
farther
down
the
creek
the
camp
of
conrad
lagrange
and
aaron
king
was
no
longer
there
quickly
he
fixed
his
gaze
again
upon
sibyl
and
her
friends
presently
as
one
will
when
looking
long
through
a
or
telescope
he
lowered
his
hands
to
rest
his
eyes
by
looking
unaided
at
the
immediate
objects
in
the
landscape
before
him
at
that
moment
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
on
the
trail
below
it
was
a
pitiful
figure
ragged
creeping
feebly
along
the
lonely
little
path
without
seeing
the
man
on
the
mountainside
above
crouching
as
he
walked
with
a
hunted
fearful
air
the
poor
creature
moved
toward
the
point
of
the
spur
around
which
the
trail
led
beneath
the
spot
where
rutlidge
sat
as
the
man
on
the
trail
drew
nearer
the
watcher
on
the
rocks
above
involuntarily
glanced
toward
the
distant
forest
ranger
then
back
to
the
as
he
rightly
guessed
escaped
convict
there
are
no
doubt
many
moments
in
the
life
of
a
man
like
james
rutlidge
when
however
bad
or
dominated
by
evil
influences
he
may
be
he
feels
strongly
the
impulse
of
pity
and
the
kindly
desire
to
help
undoubtedly
james
rutlidge
inherited
from
his
father
those
tendencies
that
made
him
easily
ruled
by
his
baser
passions
his
character
was
as
truly
the
legitimate
product
of
the
age
of
the
social
environment
and
of
the
thought
that
accepts
such
characters
what
he
might
have
been
if
better
born
or
if
schooled
in
an
atmosphere
of
moral
and
intellectual
integrity
is
an
idle
speculation
he
was
what
his
inheritance
and
his
life
had
made
him
he
was
not
without
impulses
for
good
the
pitiful
hunted
creature
creeping
so
wearily
along
the
trail
awoke
in
this
man
of
the
accepted
culture
of
his
day
a
feeling
of
compassion
and
aroused
in
him
a
desire
to
offer
assistance
for
the
legal
aspect
of
the
case
james
rutlidge
had
all
the
indifference
of
his
kind
who
imbibe
contempt
for
law
with
their
mother
milk
for
the
moment
he
hesitated
then
as
the
figure
below
passed
from
his
sight
under
the
point
of
the
spur
he
slipped
quietly
down
the
mountainside
and
a
few
minutes
later
met
the
convict
face
to
face
at
the
leveled
rifle
and
the
sharp
command
hands
up
the
poor
fellow
halted
with
a
gesture
of
tragic
despair
an
instant
they
stood
then
the
hunted
one
turned
impulsively
toward
the
canyon
that
here
lies
almost
a
sheer
thousand
feet
below
james
rutlidge
spoke
sharply
do
do
that
i
not
an
officer
i
want
to
help
you
the
convict
turned
his
hunted
fearful
starving
face
in
doubtful
bewilderment
toward
the
speaker
the
man
with
the
gun
continued
i
got
the
drop
on
you
to
prevent
accidents
until
i
could
explain
that
all
he
lowered
the
rifle
the
other
went
a
staggering
step
forward
you
mean
that
he
said
in
a
harsh
incredulous
whisper
you
you
not
playing
with
me
why
should
i
want
to
play
with
you
returned
the
other
kindly
come
let
get
off
the
trail
i
have
something
to
eat
up
there
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
his
lunch
dropping
down
upon
the
ground
the
starving
man
seized
the
offered
food
with
an
cry
feeding
noisily
with
the
manner
of
a
famished
beast
the
other
watched
with
mingled
pity
and
disgust
presently
in
stammering
halting
phrases
but
in
words
that
showed
no
lack
of
education
the
wretched
creature
attempted
to
apologize
for
his
unseemly
eagerness
and
endeavored
to
thank
his
benefactor
i
suppose
sir
there
is
no
use
trying
to
deny
my
identity
he
said
when
james
rutlidge
had
again
assured
him
of
his
kindly
interest
not
at
all
agreed
the
other
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
questioned
the
convict
i
mean
that
i
am
not
an
officer
and
have
no
reason
in
the
world
for
turning
you
over
to
them
i
saw
you
coming
along
the
trail
down
there
and
of
course
could
not
help
noticing
your
condition
and
guessing
who
you
were
to
me
you
are
simply
a
poor
devil
who
has
gotten
into
a
tight
hole
and
i
want
to
help
you
out
a
bit
that
all
the
convict
turned
his
eyes
despairingly
toward
the
canyon
below
as
he
answered
i
thank
you
sir
but
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
not
your
help
has
only
put
the
end
off
for
a
few
hours
they
got
me
shut
in
i
can
keep
away
from
them
up
here
in
the
mountains
but
i
ca
get
out
i
wo
go
back
to
that
hell
they
call
prison
though
i
wo
there
was
no
mistaking
his
desperate
purpose
james
rutlidge
thought
of
that
quick
movement
toward
the
edge
of
the
trail
and
the
rocky
depth
below
you
do
seem
such
a
bad
sort
at
heart
he
said
invitingly
i
not
returned
the
other
i
been
a
fool
miserably
weak
fool
but
i
had
my
lesson
only
i
have
had
it
too
late
while
the
man
was
speaking
james
rutlidge
was
thinking
quickly
as
he
had
been
moved
at
first
by
a
spirit
of
compassion
to
give
temporary
assistance
to
the
poor
hunted
creature
he
was
now
prompted
to
offer
more
lasting
help
providing
of
course
that
he
could
do
so
without
too
great
a
risk
to
his
own
convenience
the
convict
hopeless
condition
his
despairing
purpose
and
his
evident
wish
to
live
free
from
the
past
all
combined
to
arouse
in
the
other
a
desire
to
aid
him
but
while
that
truly
benevolent
inclination
was
in
his
consciousness
unmarred
with
sinister
motive
of
any
sort
still
deeper
than
the
impulse
for
good
in
james
rutlidge
nature
lay
those
dominant
instincts
and
passions
that
were
his
by
inheritance
and
training
the
brutal
desire
the
mood
and
purpose
that
had
brought
him
to
that
spot
where
with
the
aid
of
his
glass
he
could
watch
sibyl
andr√©s
were
not
denied
by
his
impulse
to
kindly
service
under
all
his
thinking
as
he
considered
how
he
could
help
the
convict
to
a
better
life
there
was
the
shadowy
suggestion
of
a
possible
situation
where
a
man
like
the
one
before
him
wholly
in
his
power
as
this
man
would
be
might
be
of
use
to
him
in
furthering
his
own
purpose
the
purpose
that
had
brought
about
their
meeting
studying
the
object
of
his
pity
he
said
slowly
i
suppose
the
most
of
us
are
as
deserving
of
punishment
as
the
majority
of
those
who
actually
get
it
one
way
or
another
we
are
all
trying
to
escape
the
penalty
for
our
what
if
i
should
help
you
out
make
it
possible
for
you
to
live
like
other
men
who
are
safe
from
the
law
what
would
you
do
if
i
were
to
help
you
to
your
freedom
the
hunted
man
became
incoherent
in
his
pleading
for
a
chance
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
his
wish
to
live
an
orderly
respectable
and
honest
life
you
have
a
safe
hiding
place
here
in
the
mountains
asked
rutlidge
yes
a
little
hut
hidden
in
a
deep
gorge
over
on
the
cold
water
i
could
live
there
a
year
if
i
had
supplies
james
rutlidge
considered
i
got
it
he
said
at
last
listen
there
must
be
some
peak
at
the
cold
water
end
of
this
range
from
which
you
can
see
fairlands
as
well
as
the
galena
valley
yes
the
other
answered
eagerly
and
continued
rutlidge
there
is
a
good
road
up
the
galena
valley
one
could
get
i
should
think
to
a
point
within
say
nine
hours
of
your
camp
do
you
know
anything
about
the
heliograph
yes
said
the
man
his
face
brightening
that
is
i
understand
the
general
principle
that
it
a
method
of
signaling
by
mirror
flashes
good
this
is
my
plan
i
will
meet
you
on
the
laurel
creek
trail
where
it
turns
off
from
the
creek
toward
san
gorgonio
you
know
the
spot
yes
we
will
go
around
the
head
of
clear
creek
on
the
divide
between
this
canyon
and
the
cold
water
to
some
peak
in
the
galenas
from
which
we
can
see
fairlands
and
where
with
the
we
can
pick
out
some
point
at
the
upper
end
of
galena
valley
that
we
can
both
find
later
i
understand
when
i
get
back
to
fairlands
i
will
make
a
night
trip
in
the
to
that
point
with
supplies
you
will
meet
me
there
the
day
before
i
make
the
trip
i
signal
you
by
mirror
flashes
that
i
am
coming
and
you
will
answer
from
the
peak
we
agree
on
the
time
of
day
and
the
signals
when
you
have
kept
close
long
enough
for
your
beard
and
hair
to
grow
out
well
everybody
will
have
given
you
up
for
dead
or
gone
then
i
will
take
you
down
and
give
you
a
job
in
an
orange
grove
there
a
little
house
there
where
you
can
live
you
wo
need
to
show
yourself
and
in
time
you
will
be
forgotten
i
bring
you
enough
food
to
last
you
until
i
can
return
to
town
and
can
get
back
on
the
first
night
trip
the
man
who
left
james
rutlidge
a
few
minutes
later
after
trying
brokenly
to
express
his
gratitude
was
a
creature
very
different
from
the
poor
frightened
hunted
starving
despairing
wretch
that
rutlidge
had
halted
an
hour
before
what
that
man
was
to
become
would
depend
almost
wholly
upon
his
benefactor
when
the
man
was
gone
james
rutlidge
again
took
up
his
the
old
home
of
sibyl
andr√©s
was
deserted
while
he
had
been
talking
with
the
convict
the
girl
and
myra
willard
had
started
on
their
way
back
to
fairlands
with
a
peculiar
smile
upon
his
heavy
features
the
man
slipped
the
glass
into
its
case
and
with
a
long
slow
look
over
the
scene
set
out
on
his
way
to
rejoin
his
friends
chapter
xxvi
i
want
you
just
as
you
are
the
evening
of
that
day
after
their
return
from
the
mountains
when
conrad
lagrange
had
found
aaron
king
so
absorbed
in
his
mother
letters
the
artist
continued
in
his
silent
preoccupied
mood
the
next
morning
it
was
the
same
refusing
every
attempt
of
his
friend
to
engage
him
in
conversation
he
answered
only
with
until
the
novelist
declaring
that
the
painter
was
fit
company
for
neither
beast
nor
man
left
him
alone
and
went
off
somewhere
with
czar
the
artist
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
forenoon
in
his
studio
doing
nothing
of
importance
that
is
to
a
casual
observer
he
would
have
to
be
doing
nothing
of
importance
he
did
however
place
his
picture
of
the
spring
glade
beside
the
portrait
of
taine
and
then
for
an
hour
or
more
sat
considering
the
two
paintings
then
he
turned
the
quaker
maid
again
to
the
wall
and
fixed
a
fresh
canvas
in
place
on
the
easel
that
was
all
immediately
after
their
midday
lunch
he
returned
to
the
studio
hurriedly
as
if
to
work
he
arranged
his
palette
paints
and
brushes
ready
to
his
hand
indeed
but
he
then
did
nothing
with
them
listlessly
without
interest
he
turned
through
his
portfolios
of
sketches
often
he
looked
away
through
the
big
north
window
to
the
distant
mountain
tops
often
he
seemed
to
be
listening
he
was
sitting
before
the
easel
staring
at
the
blank
canvas
when
clear
and
sweet
from
the
depths
of
the
orange
grove
came
the
pure
tones
of
sibyl
violin
so
soft
and
low
was
the
music
at
first
that
the
artist
almost
doubted
that
it
was
real
thinking
as
he
had
thought
that
day
when
sibyl
came
singing
to
the
glade
that
it
was
his
fancy
tricking
him
when
he
and
conrad
lagrange
left
the
mountains
three
days
before
the
girl
and
her
companion
had
not
expected
to
return
to
fairlands
for
at
least
two
weeks
but
there
was
no
mistaking
that
music
of
the
hills
as
the
tones
grew
louder
and
more
insistent
with
a
ringing
note
of
gladness
he
knew
that
the
mountain
girl
was
announcing
her
arrival
and
in
the
language
she
loved
best
was
greeting
her
friends
but
so
strangely
selfish
is
the
heart
of
man
that
aaron
king
gave
the
novelist
no
share
in
their
neighbor
musical
greeting
he
received
the
message
as
if
it
were
to
himself
alone
as
he
listened
his
eyes
brightened
he
stood
erect
his
face
turned
upward
toward
the
mountain
peaks
in
the
distance
his
lips
curved
in
a
slow
smile
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
the
girl
winsome
face
lighted
with
merriment
as
she
played
knowing
his
surprise
once
he
started
impulsively
toward
the
door
but
paused
hesitating
and
turned
back
when
the
music
ceased
he
went
to
the
open
window
that
looked
out
into
the
rose
garden
and
watched
expectantly
presently
he
heard
her
song
as
she
came
through
the
orange
grove
beyond
the
ragged
robin
hedge
then
he
glimpsed
her
white
dress
at
the
little
gate
in
the
corner
then
she
stood
in
full
view
the
artist
had
so
far
seen
sibyl
only
in
her
mountain
costume
of
soft
brown
made
for
rough
contact
with
rocks
and
underbrush
with
felt
hat
to
match
and
high
laced
boots
fit
for
climbing
she
was
dressed
now
as
conrad
lagrange
had
seen
her
that
first
time
in
the
garden
when
he
was
hiding
from
louise
taine
the
man
at
the
window
drew
a
little
back
with
a
low
exclamation
of
pleased
surprise
and
wonder
was
that
lovely
creature
there
among
the
roses
his
girl
comrade
of
the
hills
the
sibyl
andr√©s
he
had
known
in
the
short
skirt
and
high
boots
of
her
mountain
garb
was
a
winsome
fanciful
sometimes
serious
sometimes
wayward
maiden
this
sibyl
andr√©s
gowned
in
clinging
white
was
a
slender
gracefully
tall
and
beautifully
developed
woman
slowly
she
came
toward
the
studio
end
of
the
garden
pausing
here
and
there
to
bend
over
the
flowers
as
though
in
loving
tender
greeting
singing
the
while
her
melody
unafraid
of
the
sunshine
that
enveloped
her
in
a
golden
flood
undisturbed
by
the
careless
fingers
of
the
wind
that
caressed
her
hair
a
girl
of
the
clean
she
belonged
among
the
roses
even
as
she
had
been
at
home
among
the
pines
and
oaks
of
the
mountains
the
artist
fascinated
by
the
lovely
scene
stood
as
though
fearing
to
move
lest
the
vision
vanish
then
looking
up
she
saw
him
and
stretched
out
her
hands
in
a
gesture
of
greeting
with
a
laugh
of
pleasure
do
move
do
move
he
called
impulsively
hold
the
pose
please
hold
it
i
want
you
just
as
you
are
the
girl
amused
at
his
tragic
earnestness
and
at
the
manner
of
his
welcome
understood
that
the
zeal
of
the
artist
had
brushed
aside
the
polite
formalities
of
the
man
and
as
unaffectedly
natural
as
she
did
everything
gave
herself
to
his
mood
dragging
his
easel
with
the
blank
canvas
upon
it
across
the
studio
he
cried
out
again
do
move
please
do
move
and
began
working
he
was
as
one
beside
himself
so
wholly
absorbed
was
he
in
translating
into
the
terms
of
color
and
line
the
loveliness
purity
and
truth
that
was
expressed
by
the
personality
of
the
girl
as
she
stood
among
the
flowers
if
i
can
get
it
if
i
can
only
get
it
he
exclaimed
again
and
again
with
a
kind
of
savage
earnestness
as
he
worked
all
his
years
of
careful
training
all
his
studiously
acquired
skill
all
his
mastery
of
the
mechanics
of
his
craft
came
to
him
now
without
conscious
effort
obedient
to
his
purpose
here
was
no
thoughtful
straining
to
remember
the
laws
of
composition
and
perspective
and
harmony
here
was
no
skillful
evading
of
the
truth
he
saw
so
freely
so
surely
he
worked
he
scarcely
knew
he
painted
forgetting
self
as
he
was
unconscious
of
his
technic
he
worked
as
the
birds
sing
as
the
bees
toil
as
the
deer
runs
under
his
hand
his
picture
grew
and
blossomed
as
the
roses
themselves
among
which
the
beautiful
girl
stood
day
after
day
at
that
same
hour
sibyl
andr√©s
came
singing
through
the
orange
grove
to
stand
in
the
golden
sunlight
among
the
roses
with
hands
outstretched
in
greeting
every
day
aaron
king
waited
her
coming
sitting
before
his
easel
palette
and
brush
in
hand
each
day
he
worked
as
he
had
worked
that
first
day
with
no
thought
for
anything
save
for
his
picture
in
the
mornings
he
walked
with
conrad
lagrange
or
sometimes
worked
with
sibyl
in
the
garden
often
in
the
evening
the
two
men
would
visit
the
little
house
next
door
occasionally
the
girl
and
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
would
come
to
sit
for
a
while
on
the
front
porch
with
their
friends
thus
the
neighborly
friendship
that
began
in
the
hills
was
continued
in
the
orange
groves
the
comradeship
between
the
two
young
people
grew
stronger
hour
by
hour
as
the
painter
worked
at
his
easel
to
express
with
canvas
and
color
and
brush
the
spirit
of
the
girl
whose
character
and
life
was
so
unmarred
by
the
world
through
those
days
when
he
was
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
often
failed
to
reply
when
she
spoke
to
him
the
girl
manifested
a
helpful
understanding
of
his
mood
that
caused
the
painter
to
marvel
she
seemed
to
know
instinctively
when
he
was
baffled
or
perplexed
by
the
annoying
devils
of
that
so
delight
to
torment
artist
folk
just
as
she
knew
and
rejoiced
when
the
imps
were
routed
and
the
soul
of
the
man
exulted
with
the
sureness
and
freedom
of
his
hand
he
asked
her
once
when
they
had
finished
for
the
day
how
it
was
that
she
knew
so
well
how
the
work
was
progressing
when
she
could
not
see
the
picture
she
laughed
merrily
but
i
can
see
and
i
she
hesitated
with
that
trick
that
he
was
learning
to
know
so
well
of
searching
for
a
word
i
just
what
you
are
feeling
i
suppose
it
because
my
music
is
that
way
sometimes
it
simply
wo
come
right
at
all
and
i
feel
as
though
i
never
do
it
then
again
it
seems
to
do
itself
and
i
listen
and
wonder
just
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
so
that
day
came
when
the
artist
drawing
slowly
back
from
his
easel
stood
so
long
gazing
at
his
picture
without
touching
it
that
the
girl
called
to
him
what
the
matter
wo
it
come
right
slowly
he
laid
aside
his
palette
and
brushes
standing
at
the
open
window
he
looked
at
her
smiling
but
silent
as
she
held
the
pose
for
an
instant
she
did
not
understand
am
i
not
right
she
asked
anxiously
then
before
he
could
answer
oh
have
you
finished
is
it
all
done
still
smiling
he
answered
almost
sadly
i
have
done
all
that
i
can
do
come
a
moment
later
she
stood
in
the
studio
door
seeing
her
hesitate
he
said
again
come
i
i
am
afraid
to
look
she
faltered
he
laughed
really
i
do
think
it
quite
so
bad
as
that
oh
but
i
do
mean
that
i
afraid
it
bad
it
is
the
painter
watched
her
a
queer
expression
on
his
face
as
he
returned
curiously
and
how
pray
tell
do
you
know
it
is
bad
when
you
have
never
seen
it
it
quite
the
thing
i
admit
for
critics
to
praise
or
condemn
without
much
knowledge
of
the
work
but
i
did
expect
you
to
be
so
modern
you
are
making
fun
of
me
she
laughed
but
i
do
care
i
know
your
work
is
good
because
i
know
how
and
why
you
did
it
you
painted
it
just
as
you
painted
the
spring
glade
did
you
yes
he
said
soberly
i
did
but
why
are
you
afraid
why
that
the
reason
i
i
afraid
to
see
myself
as
you
see
me
the
man
voice
was
gentle
with
feeling
as
he
answered
seriously
miss
andr√©s
you
of
all
the
people
i
have
ever
known
have
the
least
cause
to
fear
to
look
at
your
portrait
for
reason
come
slowly
she
went
forward
to
stand
by
his
side
before
the
picture
for
some
time
she
looked
at
the
beautiful
work
into
which
aaron
king
had
put
the
best
of
himself
and
of
his
genius
at
last
turning
full
upon
him
her
eyes
blue
and
shining
she
said
in
a
low
tone
o
king
it
is
too
too
beautiful
it
is
so
beautiful
it
it
hurts
she
seems
to
to
she
searched
for
the
word
to
belong
to
the
roses
does
she
it
makes
you
feel
just
as
the
rose
garden
makes
you
feel
he
laughed
with
pleasure
what
a
child
of
nature
you
are
you
have
forgotten
that
it
is
a
portrait
of
yourself
have
you
she
laughed
with
him
i
forgotten
it
so
lovely
then
she
added
wistfully
am
i
am
i
really
like
that
just
a
little
no
he
answered
but
that
is
just
a
little
a
very
little
like
you
she
looked
at
him
half
doubtfully
sincerely
unmindful
of
the
compliment
in
her
consideration
of
its
truth
shaking
her
head
with
a
serious
smile
she
returned
slowly
i
wish
that
i
could
be
sure
you
are
not
mistaken
you
will
permit
me
to
exhibit
the
picture
will
you
he
asked
why
yes
of
course
you
made
it
for
people
to
see
did
you
i
believe
any
one
could
look
at
it
seriously
without
having
good
thoughts
could
they
i
sure
they
could
not
he
answered
but
you
see
it
a
portrait
of
you
and
i
thought
you
might
not
care
for
the
ah
he
finished
with
a
smile
shall
i
say
fame
oh
i
did
not
think
that
you
would
tell
any
one
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
is
it
necessary
that
my
name
should
be
mentioned
not
exactly
necessary
he
admitted
but
few
women
these
days
would
miss
the
opportunity
she
shook
her
head
with
a
positive
air
no
no
you
must
exhibit
it
as
a
picture
not
as
a
portrait
of
me
the
portrait
part
is
of
no
importance
it
is
what
you
have
made
your
picture
say
that
will
do
good
and
what
have
i
made
it
say
he
asked
curiously
pleased
why
it
says
that
that
a
woman
should
be
beautiful
as
the
roses
are
beautiful
without
thinking
too
much
about
it
you
know
just
as
a
man
should
be
strong
without
thinking
too
much
about
his
strength
i
mean
yes
he
agreed
it
says
that
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
whatever
title
it
is
exhibited
under
it
will
always
be
to
me
a
portrait
the
truest
i
have
ever
painted
she
flushed
with
genuine
pleasure
as
she
said
brightly
i
like
you
for
that
and
now
let
try
it
on
conrad
lagrange
and
myra
willard
you
get
him
and
i
run
and
bring
her
mind
you
do
let
lagrange
in
until
i
get
back
i
want
to
watch
him
when
he
first
sees
it
when
the
artist
found
conrad
lagrange
and
told
him
that
the
picture
was
finished
the
novelist
without
comment
turned
his
attention
to
czar
the
painter
with
an
amused
smile
asked
wo
you
come
for
a
look
at
it
old
man
the
other
returned
gruffly
thanks
but
i
do
think
i
care
to
risk
it
the
artist
laughed
but
miss
andr√©s
wants
you
to
come
she
sent
me
to
fetch
you
conrad
lagrange
turned
his
peculiar
baffling
eyes
upon
the
young
man
does
like
it
she
seems
to
if
she
to
she
does
retorted
the
other
rising
and
different
when
the
novelist
with
his
three
friends
stood
before
the
easel
he
was
silent
for
so
long
that
the
girl
said
anxiously
i
i
thought
you
would
like
it
mr
lagrange
they
saw
the
strange
man
eyes
fill
with
tears
as
he
answered
in
the
gentle
tones
that
always
marked
his
words
to
her
like
it
my
dear
child
how
could
i
help
liking
it
it
is
you
you
to
the
artist
he
added
it
is
great
work
my
boy
great
i
i
wish
your
mother
could
have
seen
it
it
is
like
her
as
i
knew
her
you
have
done
well
he
turned
with
gentle
courtesy
to
myra
willard
and
you
what
is
your
verdict
miss
willard
with
her
arm
around
the
beautiful
original
of
the
portrait
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
answered
i
think
sir
that
i
better
than
any
one
in
all
the
world
know
how
good
how
true
it
is
conrad
lagrange
spoke
again
to
the
artist
inquiringly
you
will
exhibit
it
miss
andr√©s
says
that
i
may
but
not
as
a
portrait
the
novelist
could
not
conceal
his
pleasure
at
the
answer
presently
he
said
if
it
is
not
to
be
shown
as
a
portrait
may
i
suggest
a
title
i
was
hoping
you
would
exclaimed
the
painter
and
so
was
i
cried
sibyl
with
delight
what
is
it
mr
lagrange
let
it
be
exhibited
as
spirit
of
nature
a
portrait
answered
conrad
lagrange
as
the
novelist
finished
speaking
yee
kee
appeared
in
the
doorway
they
come
big
automobile
whole
lot
people
misse
taine
miste
lutlidge
sick
man
whole
lot
i
come
tell
you
the
artist
spoke
quickly
stop
them
in
the
house
kee
i
be
right
in
and
the
chinaman
vanished
at
yee
kee
announcement
myra
willard
face
went
white
and
she
gave
a
low
cry
never
mind
dear
said
the
girl
soothingly
we
can
slip
away
through
the
garden
come
when
sibyl
and
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
were
gone
conrad
lagrange
and
aaron
king
looked
at
each
other
questioningly
then
the
novelist
said
harshly
pointing
to
the
picture
on
the
easel
you
not
going
to
let
that
flock
of
buzzards
feed
on
this
are
you
i
murder
some
one
sure
as
hell
if
you
do
i
do
think
i
could
stand
it
myself
said
the
artist
laughing
grimly
as
he
drew
the
velvet
curtain
to
hide
the
portrait
chapter
xxvii
the
answer
when
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
entered
the
house
to
meet
their
callers
from
fairlands
heights
the
artist
felt
oddly
that
he
was
meeting
a
company
of
strangers
the
carefully
hidden
yet
to
him
subtly
revealed
warmth
of
greeting
embarrassed
him
with
a
momentary
sense
of
shame
the
frothing
gush
of
louise
inane
ejaculations
and
the
coughing
choking
cursing
of
taine
whose
feeble
grip
upon
the
flesh
that
had
so
betrayed
him
was
by
now
so
far
loosed
that
he
could
scarcely
walk
alone
set
the
painter
struggling
for
words
that
would
mean
nothing
the
only
words
that
under
the
circumstances
could
serve
aaron
king
was
somewhat
out
of
practise
in
the
use
of
meaningless
words
and
the
art
of
talking
without
saying
anything
is
an
art
that
requires
constant
exercise
if
one
would
not
commit
serious
technical
blunders
james
rutlidge
greeting
was
insolently
familiar
as
a
man
of
certain
mind
greets
in
public
a
boon
companion
of
his
private
and
unmentionable
adventures
toward
the
great
critic
the
painter
exercised
a
cool
that
was
at
least
commendable
while
aaron
king
with
james
rutlidge
and
taine
with
carefully
assumed
interest
was
listening
to
louise
effort
to
make
a
jumble
of
ohs
and
ahs
and
artistic
sighs
sound
like
a
description
of
a
sunset
in
the
mountains
taine
said
quietly
to
conrad
lagrange
you
certainly
have
taken
excellent
care
of
your
protege
this
summer
he
looks
splendidly
fit
the
novelist
watching
the
woman
whose
eyes
as
she
spoke
were
upon
the
artist
answered
you
are
pleased
to
flatter
me
mrs
taine
she
turned
to
him
with
a
knowing
smile
perhaps
i
giving
you
more
credit
than
is
due
i
understand
king
has
not
been
in
your
care
altogether
shame
on
you
lagrange
for
a
man
of
your
age
and
experience
to
permit
your
charge
to
roam
all
over
the
country
alone
and
unprotected
with
a
picturesque
mountain
girl
and
that
after
your
warning
to
poor
me
conrad
lagrange
smiled
grimly
i
confess
i
thought
of
you
in
that
connection
several
times
she
eyed
him
doubtfully
oh
well
she
said
easily
i
suppose
artists
must
amuse
themselves
occasionally
the
same
as
the
rest
of
us
i
do
think
that
is
exactly
the
word
taine
the
other
returned
coldly
no
surely
you
do
meant
to
tell
me
that
it
is
anything
serious
i
do
mean
to
tell
you
anything
about
it
he
retorted
rather
sharply
she
laughed
you
do
need
to
jim
has
already
told
me
quite
enough
king
himself
will
tell
me
more
not
unless
he
a
bigger
fool
than
i
think
growled
the
novelist
again
she
laughed
into
his
face
mockingly
you
men
are
all
more
or
less
foolish
when
there
a
woman
in
the
case
are
you
to
which
the
other
answered
tartly
if
we
were
not
there
would
be
no
woman
in
the
case
as
conrad
lagrange
spoke
louise
exhausted
by
her
efforts
to
achieve
that
sunset
in
the
mountains
with
her
limited
supply
of
adjectives
floundered
hopelessly
into
the
expressive
silence
of
clasped
hands
and
heaving
breast
and
ecstatically
upturned
eyes
the
artist
seizing
the
opportunity
with
the
cunning
of
desperation
turned
to
taine
with
some
inane
remark
about
the
summers
in
california
whatever
it
was
that
he
said
taine
agreed
with
him
heartily
adding
and
you
i
suppose
have
been
making
good
use
of
your
time
or
have
you
been
simply
storing
up
material
and
energy
for
this
winter
this
brought
louise
out
of
the
depths
of
that
sunset
with
a
flop
she
was
so
sure
that
king
had
some
inexpressibly
wonderful
work
to
show
them
could
they
go
at
once
to
the
equally
inexpressibly
beautiful
studio
to
see
the
inexpressibly
lovely
pictures
that
she
was
so
inexpressibly
sure
he
had
been
painting
in
the
inexpressibly
grand
and
beautiful
and
wonderfully
lovely
mountains
the
painter
assured
them
that
he
had
no
work
for
them
to
see
and
louise
floundered
again
into
the
depths
of
inexpressible
disappointment
and
despair
nevertheless
a
few
minutes
later
aaron
king
found
himself
in
his
studio
alone
with
taine
he
could
not
have
told
exactly
how
she
managed
it
or
why
perhaps
in
sheer
pity
she
had
rescued
him
from
the
floods
of
louise
appreciation
perhaps
she
had
some
other
reasons
there
had
been
something
said
about
her
right
to
see
her
own
picture
and
then
there
they
were
with
the
others
safely
barred
from
intruding
upon
the
premises
sacred
to
art
when
there
was
no
longer
need
to
fear
the
eyes
of
the
world
taine
was
at
no
pains
to
hide
the
warmth
of
her
feeling
with
little
reserve
she
confessed
herself
in
every
look
and
tone
and
movement
are
you
really
glad
to
see
me
i
wonder
she
said
invitingly
all
this
summer
while
i
have
been
forced
to
endure
the
company
of
all
sorts
of
stupid
people
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
and
your
work
and
you
see
i
have
come
to
you
the
first
possible
moment
after
my
return
home
the
man
being
a
man
could
not
remain
wholly
insensible
to
the
alluring
physical
beauty
of
the
splendid
creature
who
stood
so
temptingly
before
him
but
to
the
honor
of
his
kind
he
could
and
did
remain
master
of
himself
the
woman
true
to
her
life
training
as
james
rutlidge
had
been
true
to
his
schooling
when
he
approached
sibyl
andr√©s
in
the
mountains
construed
the
artist
manner
not
as
a
splendid
but
as
a
careful
policy
to
her
and
to
her
kind
the
great
issues
of
life
are
governed
not
at
all
by
principle
but
by
policy
it
is
not
at
all
what
one
is
or
what
one
may
accomplish
that
matters
it
is
wholly
what
one
may
skillfully
to
be
and
what
one
may
skillfully
provoke
the
world
to
say
that
is
of
vital
importance
turning
from
the
painter
to
the
easel
as
if
to
find
in
his
portrait
of
her
the
fuller
expression
of
that
which
she
believed
he
dared
not
yet
put
into
words
she
was
about
to
draw
aside
the
curtain
when
aaron
king
checked
her
quickly
with
a
smile
that
robbed
his
words
of
any
rudeness
please
do
touch
that
taine
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
show
it
as
she
turned
from
the
easel
to
face
him
he
took
her
portrait
from
where
it
rested
face
to
the
wall
and
placed
it
upon
another
easel
saying
here
is
your
picture
with
the
painting
before
her
she
talked
eagerly
of
her
plans
for
the
artist
future
how
the
picture
was
to
be
exhibited
and
how
because
it
was
her
portrait
it
would
be
praised
and
talked
about
by
her
friends
who
were
leaders
in
the
art
circles
frankly
she
spoke
of
pull
and
influence
and
scheme
of
working
this
and
that
paper
for
of
handling
this
or
that
critic
and
writer
of
reaching
the
committees
of
introducing
the
painter
into
the
proper
inside
cliques
and
clans
and
of
clever
advertising
stunts
that
would
make
him
the
most
popular
portrait
painter
of
his
day
insuring
thus
his
as
she
called
it
fame
the
man
who
had
painted
the
picture
of
the
spring
glade
and
who
had
so
faithfully
portrayed
the
truth
and
beauty
of
sibyl
andr√©s
as
she
stood
among
the
roses
listened
to
this
woman
plans
for
making
his
portrait
of
herself
famous
with
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
and
shame
do
you
really
think
that
the
work
merits
such
prominence
as
you
say
will
be
given
it
he
asked
doubtfully
she
laughed
knowingly
just
wait
until
jim
rutlidge
appears
and
all
the
others
follow
his
lead
and
you
see
the
picture
is
clever
enough
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
it
is
beautiful
it
has
everything
that
we
women
want
in
a
portrait
i
really
do
know
much
about
what
you
painters
call
art
but
i
know
that
when
jim
and
our
friends
get
through
with
it
your
picture
will
have
every
mark
of
a
great
masterpiece
and
that
you
will
be
on
the
topmost
wave
of
success
and
then
what
he
asked
again
she
interpreted
his
words
in
the
light
of
her
own
thoughts
and
with
little
attempt
to
veil
the
fire
that
burned
in
her
eyes
answered
and
then
i
hope
that
you
will
not
forget
me
for
a
moment
he
returned
her
look
then
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
shame
for
her
swept
over
him
and
he
again
turned
away
to
stand
gazing
moodily
out
of
the
window
that
looked
into
the
rose
garden
you
seem
to
be
disturbed
and
worried
she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
a
complete
understanding
of
his
mood
and
a
tacit
acceptance
of
the
things
that
he
would
say
if
it
were
not
for
the
world
he
laughed
shortly
i
fear
you
will
think
me
ungrateful
for
your
kindness
believe
me
i
am
not
i
know
you
are
not
she
returned
but
do
think
that
you
had
better
confess
just
the
same
he
answered
wonderingly
confess
yes
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
in
playful
severity
oh
i
know
what
you
have
been
up
to
all
summer
running
wild
with
your
mountain
girl
really
you
ought
to
be
more
discreet
aaron
king
face
burned
as
he
stammered
something
about
not
knowing
what
she
meant
she
laughed
gaily
there
there
never
mind
i
forgive
you
now
that
you
are
safely
back
in
civilization
again
i
know
you
artists
and
how
you
must
have
your
periods
of
ah
relaxation
with
rather
more
liberties
than
the
common
herd
just
so
you
are
careful
that
the
world
does
know
much
at
this
frank
revelation
of
her
mind
the
man
stood
amazed
for
the
construction
she
put
upon
his
relation
with
the
girl
whose
pure
and
gentle
comradeship
had
led
him
to
greater
heights
in
his
art
than
he
had
ever
before
attained
he
could
have
driven
this
woman
from
the
studio
he
felt
that
she
profaned
but
what
could
he
say
he
remembered
conrad
counsel
when
james
rutlidge
had
seen
the
girl
at
their
camp
what
could
he
say
that
would
not
injure
sibyl
andr√©s
to
cover
his
embarrassment
he
forced
a
laugh
and
answered
lightly
really
i
am
not
good
at
confessions
nor
i
at
playing
the
part
of
confessor
she
laughed
with
him
but
just
the
same
you
might
tell
me
what
you
think
of
yourself
are
you
just
a
little
ashamed
the
artist
had
moved
to
a
position
in
front
of
her
portrait
and
as
he
looked
upon
the
painted
lie
his
answer
came
rather
let
me
tell
you
what
i
think
of
taine
and
let
me
tell
you
in
the
language
i
know
best
let
me
put
my
answer
to
your
charges
here
he
touched
her
portrait
almost
his
reply
was
worthy
of
conrad
lagrange
himself
i
do
quite
understand
she
said
a
trifle
put
out
by
the
turn
his
answer
had
taken
i
mean
he
explained
eagerly
that
i
want
to
repaint
your
portrait
you
remember
i
wrote
when
i
returned
taine
generous
check
that
i
was
not
altogether
satisfied
with
it
give
me
another
chance
you
mean
for
me
to
come
here
again
to
pose
for
you
as
i
did
before
yes
he
answered
just
as
you
did
before
i
want
to
make
a
portrait
worthy
of
you
as
this
is
not
let
me
tell
you
on
the
canvas
what
i
can
not
he
hesitated
then
said
deliberately
what
i
not
put
into
words
the
woman
received
his
words
as
a
veiled
declaration
of
a
passion
he
dared
not
yet
openly
express
she
thought
his
request
a
clever
ruse
to
renew
their
meetings
in
the
privacy
of
his
studio
and
was
accordingly
delighted
oh
that
will
be
wonderful
heavenly
she
cried
springing
to
her
feet
can
we
begin
at
once
may
i
come
yes
he
answered
come
and
may
i
wear
the
quaker
gown
yes
indeed
i
want
you
just
as
you
were
before
the
same
dress
the
same
pose
it
is
to
be
the
same
picture
you
understand
only
a
better
one
one
more
worthy
of
us
both
and
now
he
continued
hurriedly
do
you
think
that
we
should
return
to
the
house
i
suppose
so
she
answered
regretfully
lingering
the
artist
was
already
opening
the
door
as
they
passed
out
she
placed
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
up
into
his
face
admiringly
what
a
clever
clever
man
you
are
to
think
of
it
and
what
a
story
it
will
make
for
the
papers
when
my
picture
is
shown
how
you
were
not
satisfied
with
the
portrait
and
refused
to
let
it
go
and
how
after
keeping
it
in
your
studio
for
months
you
repainted
it
to
satisfy
your
artistic
conscience
aaron
king
smiled
the
announcement
in
the
house
that
the
artist
was
to
repaint
picture
provoked
characteristic
comment
louise
effervesced
a
frothy
stream
of
bubbling
exclamations
james
rutlidge
gave
a
hearty
by
jove
old
man
you
have
nerve
if
you
can
really
improve
on
that
canvas
you
are
a
wonder
and
taine
under
the
watchful
eye
of
his
beautiful
wife
responded
with
a
husky
whisper
quite
right
my
boy
quite
right
certainly
by
all
means
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
his
consent
and
approval
ending
in
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
that
left
him
weak
and
breathless
and
nearly
eliminated
him
from
the
question
altogether
when
the
fairlands
heights
party
had
departed
conrad
lagrange
looked
the
artist
up
and
down
well
he
growled
harshly
in
his
most
brutal
tones
what
is
it
is
the
dog
returning
to
his
vomit
or
is
the
prodigal
turning
his
back
on
his
hogs
and
his
husks
aaron
king
smiled
as
he
answered
i
think
rather
it
the
case
of
the
blind
beggar
who
sat
by
the
roadside
helpless
until
a
certain
great
physician
passed
that
way
and
conrad
lagrange
understood
chapter
xxviii
you
ruined
my
boy
it
was
no
light
task
to
which
aaron
king
had
set
his
hand
he
did
not
doubt
what
it
would
cost
him
nor
did
conrad
lagrange
as
they
talked
together
that
evening
fail
to
point
out
clearly
what
it
would
mean
to
the
artist
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
to
fly
thus
rudely
in
the
face
of
the
providence
that
had
chosen
to
serve
him
the
world
history
of
art
and
letters
affords
too
many
examples
of
men
who
because
they
refused
to
pay
court
to
the
ruling
cliques
and
circles
of
their
little
day
had
seen
the
doors
of
recognition
slammed
in
their
faces
and
who
even
as
they
wrought
their
great
works
had
been
forced
to
hear
as
they
toiled
the
discordant
yelpings
of
the
watchdogs
of
the
halls
of
fame
nor
did
the
artist
question
the
final
outcome
if
only
his
work
should
be
found
worthy
to
endure
for
the
world
history
establishes
also
the
truth
that
he
who
labors
for
a
higher
wage
than
an
approving
paragraph
in
the
daily
paper
may
in
spite
of
the
condemnation
of
the
pretending
rulers
live
in
the
life
of
his
race
long
after
the
names
to
which
he
refused
to
bow
are
lost
in
the
dust
of
their
thrones
the
painter
was
driven
to
his
course
by
that
without
which
no
man
can
sanely
endure
his
own
company
together
with
that
reverence
i
say
it
deliberately
that
reverence
for
his
art
without
which
no
worthy
work
is
possible
he
had
come
to
understand
that
one
may
not
prostitute
his
genius
to
the
immoral
purposes
of
a
diseased
age
without
reaping
a
prostitute
reward
the
hideous
ruin
that
taine
had
in
himself
wrought
by
the
criminal
dissipation
of
his
manhood
strength
and
by
the
debasing
of
his
physical
appetites
and
passions
was
to
aaron
king
now
a
token
of
the
intellectual
spiritual
and
moral
ruin
that
alone
can
result
from
a
debased
and
depraved
dissipation
of
an
artist
creative
power
he
saw
clearly
now
that
the
influence
his
work
must
wield
upon
the
lives
of
those
who
came
within
its
reach
must
be
identical
with
the
influence
of
sibyl
andr√©s
who
had
so
unconsciously
opened
his
eyes
to
the
true
mission
and
glory
of
the
arts
and
thus
had
made
his
decision
possible
in
that
hour
when
taine
had
revealed
herself
to
him
so
clearly
following
as
it
did
so
closely
his
days
of
work
and
the
final
completion
of
his
portrait
of
the
girl
among
the
roses
he
saw
and
felt
the
woman
not
as
one
who
could
help
him
to
the
poor
rewards
of
a
temporary
popularity
but
as
the
spirit
of
an
age
that
threatens
the
very
life
of
art
by
seeking
to
destroy
the
vital
truth
and
purpose
of
its
existence
he
felt
that
in
painting
the
portrait
of
taine
as
he
had
painted
it
he
had
betrayed
a
trust
as
truly
as
had
his
father
who
for
purely
personal
aggrandizement
had
stolen
the
material
wealth
intrusted
to
him
by
his
fellows
the
young
man
understood
now
that
instead
of
fulfilling
the
purpose
of
his
mother
sacrifice
and
realizing
for
her
her
dying
wish
as
he
had
promised
the
course
he
had
entered
upon
would
have
thwarted
the
one
and
denied
the
other
the
young
man
had
answered
the
novelist
truly
that
it
was
a
case
of
the
blind
beggar
by
the
wayside
he
might
have
carried
the
figure
farther
for
that
same
blind
beggar
when
his
eyes
had
been
opened
was
persecuted
by
the
very
ones
who
had
fed
him
in
his
infirmity
it
is
easier
sometimes
to
receive
blindly
than
to
give
with
eyes
that
see
too
clearly
when
taine
went
to
the
artist
in
the
studio
the
next
day
she
found
him
in
the
act
of
the
package
of
his
mother
letters
for
nearly
an
hour
he
had
been
reading
them
for
nearly
an
hour
before
that
he
had
been
seated
motionless
before
the
picture
that
conrad
lagrange
had
said
was
a
portrait
of
the
spirit
of
nature
when
taine
had
slipped
off
her
wrap
and
stood
before
him
gowned
in
the
dress
that
so
revealed
the
fleshly
charms
it
pretended
to
hide
she
indicated
the
letters
in
the
artist
hands
with
an
insinuating
laugh
while
there
was
a
glint
of
more
than
passing
curiosity
in
her
eyes
dear
me
she
said
i
hope
i
am
not
intruding
upon
the
claims
of
some
absent
affinity
aaron
king
gravely
held
out
his
hand
with
the
package
of
letters
saying
quietly
they
are
from
my
mother
and
the
woman
had
sufficient
grace
to
blush
for
once
with
unfeigned
shame
when
he
had
received
her
apologies
and
putting
aside
the
letters
had
succeeded
in
making
her
forget
the
incident
he
said
and
now
if
you
are
ready
shall
we
begin
for
some
time
the
painter
stood
before
the
picture
on
his
easel
without
touching
palette
or
brush
studying
the
face
of
the
woman
who
posed
for
him
by
a
slight
movement
of
her
eyes
without
turning
her
head
she
could
look
him
fairly
in
the
face
presently
as
he
continued
to
gaze
at
her
so
intently
she
laughed
and
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
a
pretense
as
of
being
cold
said
when
you
look
at
me
that
way
i
feel
as
though
you
had
surprised
me
at
my
bath
the
artist
turned
his
attention
instantly
to
his
while
setting
his
palette
with
his
eyes
upon
his
task
he
said
deliberately
surprised
at
the
bath
do
you
know
that
you
would
make
a
lovely
venus
with
a
low
laugh
she
returned
daringly
would
you
care
to
paint
me
as
the
goddess
of
love
he
still
did
not
look
at
her
but
answered
while
with
deliberate
care
he
selected
a
few
brushes
from
the
chinese
jar
near
the
easel
venus
is
always
a
very
popular
subject
you
know
she
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
and
the
painter
felt
her
watching
him
as
he
turned
to
his
canvas
still
careful
not
to
look
in
her
direction
she
said
suggestively
i
suppose
you
could
change
the
face
so
that
no
one
would
know
it
was
i
who
posed
the
man
remembered
her
carefully
acquired
reputation
for
modesty
but
held
to
his
purpose
saying
as
if
considering
the
question
seriously
oh
as
for
that
part
it
could
be
managed
with
perfect
safety
then
suddenly
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
face
with
a
gaze
so
sharp
and
piercing
that
the
blood
slowly
colored
neck
and
cheek
but
the
painter
did
not
wait
for
the
blush
he
had
seen
what
he
wanted
and
was
at
work
with
the
almost
savage
intensity
that
had
marked
his
manner
while
he
had
worked
upon
the
portrait
of
sibyl
andr√©s
and
so
day
after
day
as
he
painted
again
the
portrait
of
the
woman
who
conrad
lagrange
fancifully
called
the
age
the
artist
permitted
her
to
betray
her
real
self
the
self
that
was
so
commonly
hidden
from
the
world
under
the
mask
of
a
pretended
culture
and
the
cloak
of
a
fraudulent
refinement
he
led
her
to
talk
of
the
world
in
which
she
lived
of
the
scandals
and
intrigues
among
those
of
her
class
who
hold
such
enviable
positions
in
life
he
drew
from
her
the
philosophies
and
beliefs
and
religions
of
her
kind
he
encouraged
her
to
talk
of
art
to
give
her
understanding
of
the
world
of
artists
as
she
knew
it
and
to
express
her
real
opinions
and
tastes
in
pictures
and
books
he
persuaded
her
to
throw
boldly
aside
the
glittering
tinsel
garb
in
which
she
walked
before
the
world
and
so
to
stand
before
him
in
all
the
hideous
vulgarity
the
intellectual
poverty
and
the
moral
depravity
of
her
naked
self
at
times
when
under
his
intense
gaze
she
drew
the
cloak
of
her
pretenses
hurriedly
about
her
he
sat
before
his
picture
without
touching
the
canvas
waiting
or
perhaps
he
paced
the
floor
until
with
skillful
words
her
fears
were
banished
and
she
was
again
herself
then
with
quick
eye
and
sure
ready
hand
he
wrought
into
the
portrait
upon
the
easel
so
far
as
the
power
was
given
him
all
that
he
saw
in
the
face
of
the
woman
who
posing
for
him
secure
in
the
belief
that
he
was
painting
a
lie
revealed
her
true
nature
warped
and
distorted
as
it
was
by
an
age
that
demanding
realism
in
art
knows
not
what
it
demands
always
when
the
sitting
was
finished
he
drew
the
curtain
to
hide
the
picture
forbidding
her
to
look
at
it
until
he
said
that
it
was
finished
much
of
the
time
when
he
was
not
in
the
studio
at
work
the
painter
spent
with
taine
and
her
friends
in
the
big
touring
car
and
at
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
but
the
artist
did
not
now
enter
into
the
life
of
fairlands
pride
for
gain
or
for
pleasure
he
went
for
study
as
a
physician
goes
into
the
dissecting
room
he
justified
himself
by
the
old
and
familiar
argument
that
it
was
for
his
art
sake
sibyl
andr√©s
he
seldom
saw
except
occasionally
in
the
early
morning
in
the
rose
garden
the
girl
knew
what
he
was
doing
that
is
she
knew
that
he
was
painting
a
portrait
of
taine
and
so
with
myra
willard
avoided
the
place
but
conrad
lagrange
now
made
the
neighboring
house
in
the
orange
grove
his
place
of
refuge
from
louise
taine
who
always
accompanied
taine
lest
the
world
should
talk
but
who
never
went
as
far
as
the
studio
but
often
as
he
worked
the
artist
heard
the
music
of
the
mountain
violin
and
he
knew
that
she
in
her
own
beautiful
way
was
trying
to
help
him
as
she
would
have
said
to
put
the
mountains
into
his
work
many
times
he
was
conscious
of
the
feeling
that
some
one
was
watching
him
once
pausing
at
the
garden
end
of
the
studio
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
as
she
slipped
through
the
gate
in
the
ragged
robin
hedge
and
once
in
the
morning
after
one
of
those
afternoons
when
he
had
gone
away
with
taine
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sitting
he
found
a
note
pinned
to
the
velvet
curtain
that
hid
the
canvas
on
his
working
easel
it
was
a
quaint
little
missive
written
in
one
of
the
girl
fanciful
moods
with
a
reference
to
blue
beard
and
the
assurance
that
she
had
been
strong
and
had
not
looked
at
the
forbidden
picture
as
the
work
progressed
taine
remarked
often
how
the
artist
was
changed
when
painting
that
first
picture
he
had
been
so
sure
of
himself
working
with
careless
ease
he
had
been
suave
and
pleasant
in
his
manner
with
ready
smile
or
laugh
why
she
questioned
was
he
now
so
grave
and
serious
why
did
he
pause
so
often
to
sit
staring
at
his
canvas
or
to
pace
the
floor
why
did
he
seem
to
be
so
uncertain
to
be
questioning
searching
hesitating
the
woman
thought
that
she
knew
rejoicing
in
her
fancied
victory
all
but
won
she
looked
forward
to
the
triumphant
moment
when
this
splendid
man
should
be
swept
from
his
feet
by
the
force
of
the
passion
she
thought
she
saw
him
struggling
to
conceal
meanwhile
she
tempted
him
by
all
the
wiles
she
knew
inviting
him
with
eyes
and
lips
and
graceful
pose
and
meaning
gesture
and
aaron
king
with
clear
untroubled
eye
seeing
all
with
cool
brain
understanding
all
with
steady
skillful
hand
ruled
supremely
by
his
purpose
painted
that
which
he
saw
and
understood
into
his
portrait
of
her
so
they
came
to
the
last
sitting
on
the
following
evening
taine
was
giving
a
dinner
at
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
at
which
the
artist
was
to
meet
some
people
who
would
be
as
she
said
useful
to
him
eastern
people
they
were
from
the
accredited
center
of
art
and
literature
members
of
the
inner
circle
of
the
elect
they
happened
to
be
spending
the
season
on
the
coast
and
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
advance
the
painter
interests
it
was
very
fortunate
that
her
portrait
was
to
be
finished
in
time
for
them
to
see
it
the
artist
was
sorry
he
said
but
while
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
her
to
come
to
the
studio
again
the
picture
was
not
yet
finished
and
he
could
not
permit
its
being
exhibited
until
he
was
ready
to
sign
the
canvas
but
i
may
see
it
she
asked
as
he
laid
aside
his
palette
and
brushes
and
announced
that
he
was
through
with
a
quick
hand
he
drew
the
curtain
not
yet
please
not
until
i
am
ready
oh
she
cried
with
a
charming
air
of
submitting
to
one
whose
wish
is
law
how
mean
of
you
i
know
it
is
splendid
are
you
satisfied
is
it
better
than
the
other
is
it
like
me
i
am
sure
that
it
is
much
better
than
the
other
he
replied
it
is
as
like
you
as
i
can
make
it
and
is
it
as
beautiful
as
the
other
it
is
beautiful
as
you
are
beautiful
he
answered
i
shall
tell
them
all
about
it
night
even
if
i
have
seen
it
and
so
will
jim
rutlidge
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
spent
that
evening
at
the
little
house
next
door
the
next
morning
the
artist
shut
himself
up
in
his
studio
at
lunch
time
he
would
not
come
out
late
in
the
afternoon
the
novelist
went
again
to
knock
at
the
door
the
artist
called
in
a
voice
that
rang
with
triumph
come
in
old
man
come
in
and
help
me
celebrate
entering
conrad
lagrange
found
him
sitting
pale
and
worn
before
his
picture
his
palette
and
brushes
still
in
his
hand
and
such
a
picture
a
moment
the
novelist
who
knew
as
few
men
know
the
world
that
was
revealed
with
such
fidelity
in
that
face
upon
the
canvas
looked
then
with
weird
and
wonderful
oaths
of
delight
he
caught
the
tired
artist
and
whirled
him
around
the
studio
in
a
triumphant
dance
you
done
it
man
you
done
it
it
all
there
every
rotten
stinking
shred
of
it
wow
but
it
good
so
damned
good
that
it
almost
inhuman
i
knew
you
had
it
in
you
i
knew
it
was
in
you
all
the
time
if
only
you
could
come
alive
god
man
if
could
only
be
exhibited
alongside
the
other
look
here
he
dragged
the
easel
that
held
sibyl
andr√©s
portrait
to
a
place
beside
the
one
upon
which
the
canvas
just
finished
rested
and
drew
back
the
curtain
the
effect
was
startling
spirit
of
nature
and
spirit
of
the
age
said
conrad
lagrange
in
a
low
tone
but
you
ruined
my
boy
he
added
gleefully
you
ruined
these
canvases
will
never
be
exhibited
her
own
she
smash
when
she
sees
it
and
you
be
artistically
damned
by
the
very
gods
she
has
invoked
to
bless
you
with
fame
and
wealth
lord
but
i
envy
you
you
have
your
chance
now
a
real
chance
to
be
worthy
your
mother
sacrifice
come
on
let
get
ready
for
the
feast
chapter
xxix
the
hand
writing
on
the
wall
it
was
november
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
that
day
when
the
young
man
on
the
golden
state
limited
with
the
inheritance
he
had
received
from
his
mother
dying
lips
and
with
his
solemn
promise
to
her
still
fresh
in
his
mind
looked
into
the
eyes
of
the
woman
on
the
platform
of
the
observation
car
that
same
day
too
he
first
saw
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
and
for
the
first
time
met
the
famous
conrad
lagrange
aaron
king
was
thinking
of
these
things
as
he
set
out
that
evening
with
his
friend
for
the
home
of
taine
he
remarked
to
the
novelist
that
the
time
seemed
to
him
many
years
to
me
aaron
answered
the
strange
man
it
has
been
the
happiest
and
if
you
would
not
misunderstand
me
the
most
satisfying
year
of
my
life
and
this
he
added
his
deep
voice
betraying
his
emotion
this
has
been
the
happiest
day
of
the
year
it
is
your
independence
day
i
shall
always
celebrate
it
as
such
i
i
have
no
independence
day
of
my
own
to
celebrate
you
know
aaron
king
did
not
misunderstand
as
the
two
men
approached
the
big
house
on
fairlands
heights
they
saw
that
modern
palace
from
concrete
foundation
to
roof
ablaze
with
many
lights
situated
upon
the
very
topmost
of
the
socially
graded
levels
of
fairlands
it
outshone
them
all
and
quite
likely
the
glittering
display
was
mistaken
by
many
dwellers
in
the
valley
below
for
a
new
constellation
of
the
heavenly
bodies
quite
likely
too
some
lonely
dweller
high
up
among
the
distant
mountain
peaks
looked
down
upon
the
sparkling
bauble
that
lay
for
the
moment
as
it
were
on
the
wide
lap
of
the
night
and
smiled
in
quiet
amusement
that
the
earth
children
should
attach
such
value
to
so
fragile
a
toy
as
they
passed
the
massive
stone
pillars
of
the
entrance
to
the
grounds
conrad
lagrange
said
really
aaron
do
you
feel
a
little
ashamed
of
yourself
coming
here
after
the
outrageous
return
you
have
made
for
the
generous
hospitality
of
these
people
you
know
that
if
taine
had
seen
what
you
have
done
to
her
portrait
you
could
force
the
pearly
gates
easier
than
you
could
break
in
here
the
artist
laughed
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
feel
exactly
at
home
but
what
the
deuce
can
i
do
after
my
intimacy
with
them
all
these
months
i
ca
assume
that
they
are
going
to
make
my
picture
a
reason
for
refusing
to
recognize
me
can
i
as
i
see
it
they
not
i
must
take
the
initiative
i
ca
say
i
told
the
truth
about
you
so
throw
me
out
the
novelist
grinned
thus
it
is
when
becomes
entangled
with
the
family
of
it
hard
to
break
away
from
the
even
when
you
know
you
are
on
the
road
to
the
promised
land
but
worry
age
will
take
the
initiative
fast
enough
when
she
sees
your
portrait
of
her
wow
in
the
meantime
let
play
their
game
and
take
what
spoils
the
gods
may
send
there
will
be
material
here
for
pictures
and
stories
a
plenty
as
they
went
up
the
wide
steps
and
under
the
portal
into
the
glare
of
the
lights
and
caught
the
sound
of
the
voices
within
he
added
under
his
breath
lord
man
but
is
a
pretty
show
if
only
things
were
called
by
their
right
names
that
old
babylonian
belshazzar
had
nothing
on
us
moderns
after
all
did
he
watch
out
for
the
writing
upon
the
wall
when
aaron
king
and
his
companion
entered
the
spacious
rooms
where
the
pride
of
fairlands
heights
and
the
eastern
lions
were
assembled
a
buzz
of
comment
went
round
the
glittering
company
aside
from
the
fact
that
taine
with
practised
skill
had
prepared
the
way
for
her
protege
by
subtly
stimulating
the
curiosity
of
her
guests
the
appearance
of
the
two
men
alone
would
have
attracted
their
attention
the
artist
with
his
strong
splendidly
proportioned
athletic
body
and
his
handsome
intellectual
face
calmly
sure
of
himself
with
the
air
of
one
who
knows
that
his
veins
are
rich
with
the
wealth
of
many
generations
of
true
culture
and
refinement
and
the
novelist
easily
the
most
famous
of
his
day
tall
emaciated
grotesquely
stooped
with
his
homely
face
seamed
and
lined
and
old
and
his
sharp
eyes
peering
from
under
his
craggy
brows
with
that
analyzing
cynical
expression
certainly
presented
a
contrast
too
striking
to
escape
notice
for
an
instant
as
comrades
side
by
side
upon
a
might
do
they
glanced
over
the
scene
to
the
painter
eye
the
assembled
guests
appeared
as
a
glittering
shimmering
scintillating
mass
that
never
still
stirred
within
itself
in
slow
graceful
restless
motions
forming
always
without
purpose
new
combinations
and
groupings
that
were
broken
up
even
as
they
were
shaped
to
be
reformed
with
the
black
spots
and
splashes
of
the
men
conventional
dress
ever
changing
amid
the
brighter
colors
and
textures
of
the
women
gowns
the
warm
flesh
tints
of
bare
white
arms
and
shoulders
gleaming
here
and
there
and
the
flash
and
sparkle
of
jewels
threading
the
sheen
of
silks
and
the
filmy
softness
of
laces
into
the
artist
mind
fresh
from
the
tragic
earnestness
of
his
day
work
and
still
under
the
enduring
spell
of
his
weeks
in
the
mountains
flashed
a
sentence
from
a
good
old
book
for
what
is
your
life
it
is
even
a
vapor
that
appeareth
for
a
little
time
and
then
vanisheth
away
then
they
were
greeting
with
conventional
nothings
their
beautiful
hostess
who
with
a
charming
air
of
triumphant
but
not
too
triumphant
proprietorship
received
them
and
passed
them
on
with
a
low
spoken
word
to
aaron
king
i
will
take
charge
of
you
later
conrad
lagrange
before
they
drifted
apart
found
opportunity
to
growl
in
his
companion
ear
a
musician
an
actress
of
divorce
court
fame
an
art
critic
boon
companion
of
our
friend
rutlidge
two
yellow
journalists
a
poet
with
leading
women
of
various
brands
and
a
mob
of
mere
fashion
and
wealth
the
pickings
should
be
good
look
at
over
there
in
a
wheeled
chair
attended
by
a
servant
in
livery
a
little
apart
from
the
center
of
the
scene
as
though
the
pageant
of
life
was
about
to
move
on
without
him
but
still
with
desperate
grip
holding
his
place
in
the
picture
sat
the
genius
of
it
all
the
millionaire
the
creature
wasted
limbs
were
clothed
grotesquely
in
conventional
evening
dress
his
haggard
bestial
face
repulsive
with
every
mark
of
his
wicked
licentious
years
grinned
with
an
insane
determination
to
take
the
place
that
was
his
by
right
of
his
money
bags
while
his
glazed
and
sunken
eyes
shone
with
fitful
gleams
as
he
rallied
the
last
of
his
vital
forces
with
a
devilish
defiance
of
the
end
that
was
so
inevitably
near
as
aaron
king
in
the
splendid
strength
of
his
inheritance
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
master
of
the
house
that
poor
product
of
our
age
was
seized
by
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
that
shook
him
gasping
and
choking
almost
into
unconsciousness
the
ready
attendant
held
out
a
glass
of
whisky
and
he
clutched
the
goblet
with
skinny
hands
that
in
their
trembling
eagerness
rattled
the
crystal
against
his
teeth
in
the
momentary
respite
afforded
by
the
powerful
stimulant
he
lifted
his
yellow
hand
to
wipe
the
clammy
beads
of
sweat
that
gathered
upon
his
wrinkled
brow
and
the
painter
saw
on
one
bony
finger
the
gleaming
flash
of
a
magnificent
diamond
taine
greeted
the
artist
with
his
husky
whisper
hello
old
chap
glad
to
see
you
peering
into
the
laughing
chattering
glittering
throng
he
added
some
beauties
here
heh
gad
my
boy
but
i
seen
the
day
i
be
out
there
among
them
ha
ha
taine
louise
and
jim
tried
to
shelve
me
but
i
fooled
damn
me
but
i
game
for
a
good
time
yet
a
little
off
my
feed
and
under
the
weather
but
game
you
understand
game
as
hell
then
to
the
attendant
where
that
whisky
and
again
his
yellow
hand
with
that
beautiful
diamond
a
gleaming
point
of
pure
white
light
lifted
the
glass
to
his
grinning
lips
when
taine
appeared
to
claim
the
artist
her
husband
huddled
in
his
chair
an
unclean
heap
of
all
but
decaying
flesh
watched
them
go
with
hidden
impotent
rage
a
few
moments
later
as
taine
and
her
charge
were
leaving
one
group
of
celebrities
in
search
of
another
they
encountered
conrad
lagrange
what
this
i
see
gibed
the
novelist
mockingly
is
it
being
led
by
beauty
to
the
judges
and
executioners
or
is
it
presenting
an
artist
to
the
gods
of
modern
art
you
had
better
be
helping
a
good
cause
instead
of
making
fun
lagrange
the
woman
retorted
you
were
always
so
famous
yourself
that
you
could
afford
to
be
indifferent
you
know
aaron
king
laughed
as
his
friend
replied
never
fear
madam
never
fear
i
shall
be
on
hand
to
assist
at
the
obsequies
in
the
shifting
of
the
groups
and
figures
when
dinner
was
announced
the
young
man
found
himself
again
within
reach
of
conrad
lagrange
and
the
novelist
whispered
with
a
grin
now
for
the
in
earnest
you
will
be
really
out
of
place
in
the
next
act
aaron
only
we
artists
who
have
sold
our
souls
have
a
right
to
the
price
of
our
shame
should
dine
upon
a
crust
you
know
a
genius
without
his
crust
huh
a
devil
without
his
tail
or
an
ass
without
his
long
ears
most
conspicuous
in
the
brilliant
throng
assembled
in
that
banquet
hall
was
the
horrid
figure
of
taine
who
sat
in
his
wheeled
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
liveried
attendant
by
his
side
frequently
as
though
compelled
eyes
were
turned
toward
that
master
of
the
feast
who
was
himself
so
far
past
feasting
and
toward
his
beautiful
young
wife
the
only
woman
in
the
room
whose
shoulders
and
arms
were
not
bare
at
first
the
talk
moved
somewhat
heavily
neighbor
chattered
nothings
to
neighbor
in
low
tones
it
was
as
though
the
foreboding
presence
of
some
grim
unbidden
guest
overshadowed
the
spirits
of
the
company
but
gradually
the
scene
became
more
animated
the
glitter
of
silver
and
crystal
on
the
board
the
sparkle
of
jewels
and
the
wealth
of
shimmering
colors
that
costumed
the
diners
with
the
strains
of
music
that
came
from
somewhere
behind
a
floral
screen
that
filled
the
air
with
fragrance
concealed
as
it
were
the
hideous
image
of
immorality
which
was
the
presiding
genius
of
the
feast
as
the
glare
of
a
too
bright
light
blinds
the
eyes
to
the
ditch
across
one
path
so
the
brilliancy
of
their
surroundings
blinded
the
eyes
of
his
guests
to
the
meaning
of
that
horrid
figure
in
the
seat
of
highest
honor
but
rich
foods
and
rare
wines
soon
loose
the
tongues
that
chatter
the
thoughts
of
those
who
do
not
think
as
the
glasses
were
filled
and
refilled
again
the
scene
took
color
from
the
sparkling
goblets
voices
were
raised
to
a
higher
pitch
shrill
or
boisterous
laughter
rang
out
as
jest
and
story
went
the
rounds
it
was
taine
now
rather
than
her
husband
who
dominated
the
scene
with
cheeks
flushed
and
eyes
bright
she
set
the
pace
nor
permitted
any
laggards
conrad
lagrange
watched
cool
and
cynical
his
worn
face
twisted
into
a
mocking
smile
his
keen
baffling
eyes
from
under
their
scowling
brows
seeing
all
understanding
all
aaron
king
weary
with
the
work
of
the
past
days
endured
wishing
it
was
over
the
evening
was
well
under
way
when
taine
held
up
her
hand
in
the
silence
she
said
listen
i
have
a
real
treat
for
you
friends
listen
as
she
spoke
the
last
word
her
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
artist
in
mocking
challenging
humor
he
was
wondering
what
she
meant
when
from
behind
that
screen
of
flowers
soft
and
low
poignantly
sweet
and
thrilling
in
its
purity
of
tone
came
the
music
of
the
violin
that
he
had
learned
to
know
so
well
instantly
the
painter
understood
taine
had
employed
sibyl
andr√©s
to
play
for
her
guests
that
evening
thinking
to
tease
the
artist
by
presenting
his
mountain
comrade
in
the
guise
of
a
hired
servant
why
the
girl
had
not
told
him
he
did
not
know
perhaps
she
had
thought
to
enjoy
his
surprise
the
effect
of
the
girl
presence
or
rather
of
her
music
for
she
herself
could
not
be
seen
upon
the
artist
was
quite
other
than
taine
intended
under
the
spell
of
the
spirit
that
spoke
in
the
violin
aaron
king
was
carried
far
from
his
glittering
surroundings
again
he
stood
where
the
bright
waters
of
clear
creek
tumbled
among
the
granite
boulders
and
where
he
had
first
moved
to
answer
the
call
of
that
music
of
the
hills
again
he
followed
the
old
wagon
road
to
the
cedar
thicket
and
in
the
little
grassy
opening
with
its
wild
roses
its
encircling
wilderness
growth
and
its
old
log
house
under
the
sheltering
sycamores
saw
a
beautiful
girl
dancing
with
the
unconscious
grace
of
a
woodland
sprite
her
arms
upheld
in
greeting
to
the
mountains
once
again
he
was
painting
in
the
sacred
quiet
of
the
spring
glade
where
she
had
come
to
him
with
her
three
gifts
where
in
maidenly
innocence
she
had
danced
the
dance
of
the
butterflies
and
later
with
her
music
had
lifted
their
friendship
to
heights
of
purity
as
far
above
the
comprehension
of
the
company
that
listened
to
her
now
as
the
mountain
peaks
among
the
stars
that
night
were
high
above
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
the
music
ceased
it
was
followed
by
the
loud
clapping
of
hands
with
exclamations
in
voices
who
is
it
where
did
you
find
him
what
his
name
for
they
judged
from
taine
introductory
words
that
she
expected
them
to
show
their
appreciation
taine
laughed
and
with
her
eyes
mockingly
upon
the
artist
face
answered
lightly
oh
she
is
a
discovery
of
mine
she
teaches
music
and
plays
in
one
of
the
fairlands
churches
you
are
a
wonder
said
one
of
the
illustrious
critics
admiringly
and
lifting
his
glass
he
cried
here
to
our
beautiful
and
talented
hostess
the
patron
saint
of
all
the
arts
the
friend
of
all
true
artists
in
the
quiet
that
followed
the
enthusiastic
endorsement
of
the
distinguished
gentleman
words
another
voice
said
if
it
a
girl
ca
we
see
her
yes
yes
came
from
several
please
taine
bring
her
out
have
her
play
again
will
she
taine
laughed
certainly
she
will
that
what
she
here
for
to
amuse
you
and
again
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
aaron
king
at
her
signal
a
servant
left
the
room
a
moment
later
the
mountain
girl
dressed
in
simple
white
with
no
jewel
or
ornament
other
than
a
rose
in
her
soft
brown
hair
stood
before
that
company
unconscious
of
the
eyes
that
fed
upon
her
loveliness
there
was
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
upon
her
face
as
she
met
in
one
swift
glance
the
artist
look
then
raising
her
violin
she
made
music
for
the
revelers
at
the
will
of
taine
as
she
stood
there
in
the
modest
naturalness
of
her
winsome
beauty
innocent
and
pure
as
the
flowers
that
formed
the
screen
behind
her
hired
to
amuse
the
worthy
friends
and
guests
of
that
hideously
repulsive
devotee
of
lust
and
licentiousness
who
from
his
wheeled
chair
was
glaring
at
her
with
eyes
that
burned
insanely
she
seemed
as
indeed
she
was
a
spirit
from
another
world
james
rutlidge
his
heavy
features
flushed
with
drink
was
gazing
at
the
girl
with
a
look
that
betrayed
his
sensual
passion
the
face
of
conrad
lagrange
was
dark
and
grim
with
scowling
appreciation
of
the
situation
taine
was
looking
at
the
artist
and
aaron
king
watching
his
girl
comrade
of
the
hills
as
she
seemed
to
listen
for
the
music
which
she
in
turn
drew
from
the
instrument
felt
by
the
very
force
of
the
contrast
between
her
and
her
surroundings
he
had
never
felt
before
the
power
and
charm
of
her
personality
felt
and
knew
that
sibyl
andr√©s
had
come
into
his
life
to
stay
in
the
flood
of
emotions
that
swept
over
him
and
in
the
mental
and
spiritual
exultation
caused
by
her
music
and
by
her
presence
amid
such
scenes
it
was
given
the
painter
to
understand
that
she
had
in
truth
brought
to
him
the
strength
the
purity
and
the
beauty
of
the
hills
that
she
had
in
truth
shown
him
the
paths
that
lead
to
the
mountain
heights
that
it
was
her
unconscious
influence
and
teaching
that
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
prostitute
his
genius
to
win
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
knew
now
that
in
those
days
when
he
had
painted
her
portrait
as
she
stood
with
outstretched
hands
in
the
golden
light
among
the
roses
he
had
mixed
his
colors
with
the
best
love
that
a
man
may
offer
a
woman
and
he
knew
that
the
repainting
of
that
false
portrait
of
taine
with
all
that
it
would
cost
him
was
his
first
offering
to
that
love
the
girl
musician
finished
playing
and
slipped
away
when
they
would
have
recalled
her
taine
too
well
schooled
to
betray
a
hint
of
the
emotions
aroused
by
what
she
had
just
seen
as
she
watched
aaron
king
shook
her
head
at
that
instant
taine
rose
to
his
feet
supporting
himself
by
holding
with
shaking
hands
to
the
table
a
hush
sudden
as
the
hush
of
death
fell
upon
the
company
the
millionaire
attendant
put
out
his
hand
to
steady
his
master
and
another
servant
stepped
quickly
forward
but
the
man
who
clung
so
tenaciously
to
his
last
bit
of
life
with
a
drunken
strength
in
his
dying
limbs
shook
them
off
saying
in
a
hoarse
whisper
never
mind
never
mind
you
fools
ca
you
see
i
game
in
the
quiet
of
the
room
that
a
moment
before
rang
with
excited
voices
and
shrill
laughter
the
man
husky
straining
whispered
boast
sounded
like
the
mocking
of
some
invisible
fiendish
presence
at
the
feast
lifting
a
glass
of
whisky
with
that
yellow
hand
upon
which
the
great
diamond
gleamed
a
spot
of
flawless
purity
with
his
repulsive
features
twisted
into
a
grewsome
ugliness
by
his
straining
effort
to
force
his
diseased
vocal
chords
to
make
his
words
heard
the
wretched
creature
said
here
to
our
girl
musician
the
prettiest
lassie
that
i
have
seen
for
many
a
day
and
i
think
i
know
a
pretty
girl
when
i
see
one
too
who
comes
bright
and
fresh
from
her
mountains
to
amuse
us
and
to
add
to
the
beauty
and
grace
and
wit
and
genius
that
so
distinguishes
this
company
the
flavor
and
the
freedom
of
her
home
her
music
is
good
you
all
agree
he
paused
to
cough
and
to
look
inquiringly
around
while
every
one
nodded
approval
and
smiled
encouragingly
her
music
is
good
but
i
maintain
that
she
herself
is
better
to
me
her
beauty
is
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
than
her
fiddling
can
possibly
be
to
the
ear
again
he
was
forced
to
pause
while
his
guests
with
hand
and
voice
applauded
the
clever
words
lifting
the
glass
of
whisky
toward
his
lips
that
by
his
effort
to
speak
were
drawn
back
in
a
repulsive
grin
he
leered
at
the
celebrities
sitting
nearest
i
suppose
if
we
desire
the
company
of
these
distinguished
artists
we
will
have
to
follow
them
to
the
mountains
i
do
blame
you
gentlemen
if
i
was
not
ah
temporarily
incapacitated
i
would
certainly
go
for
a
little
trip
to
the
inspiring
hills
myself
even
if
i
do
know
as
much
about
and
as
some
of
you
again
his
words
were
interrupted
by
that
racking
cough
the
sound
of
which
was
lost
in
the
applause
that
greeted
his
witticism
lifting
the
glass
once
more
he
continued
so
here
to
our
girl
musician
who
is
her
own
lovely
self
so
much
more
attractive
than
any
music
she
can
ever
make
he
drained
the
glass
and
sank
back
into
his
chair
exhausted
by
his
effort
aaron
king
was
on
the
point
of
springing
to
his
feet
when
conrad
lagrange
caught
his
eye
with
a
warning
look
instantly
he
remembered
what
the
result
would
be
if
he
should
yield
to
his
impulse
wild
with
indignation
rage
and
burning
shame
he
knew
that
to
betray
himself
would
be
to
invite
a
thousand
sneering
questions
and
insinuations
to
besmirch
the
name
of
the
girl
he
loved
in
the
continued
applause
and
laughter
that
followed
the
drinking
of
the
millionaire
toast
the
artist
caught
the
admiring
words
bully
old
sport
is
he
game
he
has
certainly
traveled
some
pace
in
his
day
the
girl
is
a
beauty
let
have
her
in
again
this
last
expression
was
so
insistently
echoed
that
taine
who
through
it
all
had
been
covertly
watching
aaron
king
face
and
whose
eyes
were
blazing
now
with
something
more
than
the
effect
of
the
wine
she
had
been
drinking
was
forced
to
yield
a
servant
left
the
room
and
a
moment
later
reappeared
followed
by
sibyl
the
girl
was
greeted
now
by
hearty
applause
which
she
accepting
as
an
expression
of
the
company
appreciation
of
her
music
received
with
smiling
pleasure
the
artist
his
heart
and
soul
aflame
with
his
awakening
love
fought
for
conrad
lagrange
catching
his
eye
again
silently
bade
him
wait
sibyl
lifted
her
violin
and
the
noisy
company
was
stilled
slowly
under
the
spell
of
the
music
that
to
him
was
a
message
from
the
mountain
heights
aaron
king
grew
calm
his
tense
muscles
relaxed
his
twitching
nerves
became
steady
he
felt
himself
as
it
were
lifted
out
of
and
above
the
scene
that
a
moment
before
had
so
stirred
him
to
indignant
anger
his
brain
worked
with
that
clearness
and
precision
which
he
had
known
while
repainting
taine
portrait
wrath
gave
way
to
pity
indignation
to
contempt
in
confidence
he
smiled
to
think
how
little
the
girl
he
loved
needed
his
poor
defense
against
the
animalism
that
dominated
the
company
she
was
hired
to
amuse
with
every
eye
in
the
room
fixed
upon
her
as
she
played
she
was
as
far
removed
from
those
who
had
applauded
the
suggestive
words
of
the
dying
sensualist
as
her
music
was
beyond
their
true
comprehension
then
it
was
that
the
genius
of
the
artist
awoke
as
the
flash
of
a
in
the
darkness
of
night
brings
out
with
startling
clearness
the
details
of
the
scene
upon
which
it
is
turned
the
painter
saw
before
him
his
picture
with
trained
eye
and
carefully
acquired
skill
he
studied
the
scene
impressing
upon
his
memory
every
detail
the
rich
appointments
of
the
room
the
glittering
lights
the
gleaming
silver
and
crystal
the
sparkling
jewels
and
shimmering
laces
the
bare
shoulders
the
faces
and
feverish
eyes
and
in
the
seat
of
honor
the
form
and
repulsive
countenance
of
taine
who
almost
unconscious
with
his
exertion
was
still
feeding
the
last
flickering
flame
of
his
lustful
life
with
the
vision
of
the
girl
whose
beauty
his
toast
had
profaned
and
in
the
midst
of
that
company
expressing
as
it
did
the
spirit
of
an
age
that
is
ruled
by
material
wealth
and
dominated
by
the
passions
of
the
flesh
the
center
of
every
eye
yet
still
in
her
purity
and
innocence
removed
and
apart
from
them
all
standing
in
her
simple
dress
of
white
against
the
background
of
flowers
the
mountain
girl
with
her
violin
offering
to
them
the
highest
holiest
gift
of
the
gods
her
music
upon
the
girl
lovely
winsome
face
was
a
look
now
of
troubled
doubt
her
wide
blue
eyes
as
she
played
were
pleading
questioning
half
fearful
as
though
she
sensed
instinctively
the
presence
of
the
spirit
she
could
not
understand
and
felt
in
spite
of
the
pretense
of
the
applause
that
had
greeted
her
the
rejection
of
her
offering
not
only
did
the
artist
in
that
moment
of
conception
see
his
picture
and
feel
the
forces
that
were
expressed
by
every
character
in
the
composition
but
the
title
even
came
to
him
as
clearly
as
if
conrad
lagrange
had
uttered
it
aloud
the
feast
of
materialism
sibyl
andr√©s
finished
her
music
and
quickly
withdrew
as
if
to
escape
the
noisy
applause
amid
the
sound
of
the
clapping
hands
and
boisterous
voices
taine
summoning
the
last
of
his
wasted
strength
again
struggled
to
his
feet
with
those
hands
he
held
to
the
table
for
support
while
shaking
in
every
limb
his
features
twisted
into
a
horrid
leering
grin
he
looked
from
face
to
face
of
the
hushed
and
silent
company
with
glazed
eyes
in
which
the
light
that
flickered
so
feebly
was
still
the
light
of
an
impotent
lust
twice
the
man
essayed
to
speak
but
could
not
the
room
grew
still
as
death
then
suddenly
as
they
looked
he
lifted
that
yellow
skinny
hand
to
his
wrinkled
brow
and
partially
loosing
thus
his
supporting
grip
upon
the
table
fell
back
in
a
ghastly
heap
of
diseased
flesh
and
fine
raiment
in
the
midst
of
which
blazed
the
great
diamond
as
though
the
cold
pure
beauty
of
the
inanimate
stone
triumphed
in
a
life
more
vital
than
that
of
its
wearer
his
servants
carried
the
unconscious
master
of
the
house
from
the
room
taine
excusing
herself
followed
in
the
confusion
that
ensued
the
musicians
hidden
behind
the
floral
screen
struck
up
a
lively
air
some
of
the
guests
made
quiet
preparations
for
leaving
a
group
of
those
men
famous
in
the
world
of
art
and
letters
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
they
had
taken
so
freely
laughed
loudly
at
some
coarse
jest
others
thinking
perhaps
if
they
could
be
said
to
think
at
all
that
their
host
attack
was
not
serious
renewed
conversations
and
bravely
attempted
to
restore
a
semblance
of
animation
to
the
interrupted
revelries
aaron
king
worked
his
way
to
the
side
of
conrad

for
god
sake
old
man
let
get
out
of
here
i
find
rutlidge
or
louise
or
some
one
returned
the
other
and
disappeared
as
the
artist
waited
through
the
open
door
of
an
adjoining
room
he
caught
sight
of
sibyl
andr√©s
who
with
her
in
her
hand
was
about
to
leave
obeying
his
impulse
he
went
to
her
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
he
said
almost
roughly
extending
his
hand
to
take
the
instrument
she
carried
she
seemed
a
little
bewildered
by
his
manner
but
smiled
as
she
retained
her
violin
i
am
here
to
earn
my
bread
and
butter
sir
what
are
you
doing
here
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
she
laughed
then
with
a
troubled
air
but
is
it
not
right
for
me
to
be
here
it
is
all
right
for
me
to
play
for
these
people
is
it
myra
did
want
me
to
come
but
we
needed
the
money
and
taine
was
so
generous
i
did
tell
you
and
lagrange
because
i
wanted
the
fun
of
surprising
you
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
so
gravely
she
put
out
her
hand
impulsively
to
his
arm
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
how
have
i
done
wrong
you
have
done
no
wrong
my
dear
girl
he
answered
it
is
only
that
he
was
interrupted
by
the
cold
clear
voice
of
taine
who
had
entered
the
room
unnoticed
by
them
i
see
you
are
going
miss

i
will
mail

check

very
satisfactory

before
aaron
king
could
speak
the
girl
was
gone
lagrange
and
i
were
just
about

said
the
artist
as
the
woman
faced
him
i
hope
taine
has
not
suffered
severely
from
the
excitement
of
the
evening
the
woman
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
feverish
excitement
going
close
to
him
she
said
in
a
low
hurried
tone
no

must
not
go

all
right
in
his
room

for
a
single
moment

i
as
she
had
interrupted
aaron
king
reply
to
sibyl
andr√©s
the
cool
sarcastic
tones
of
conrad
lagrange
deep
voice
interrupted
her
taine
they

hunting
for

over
the
house

calling
for

i
sure
that

under

circumstances
chapter

in
the
same
hour
in
a
splendid
chamber
surrounded
by
every
comfort
and
luxury
that
dollars
could
buy
and
attended
by
liveried
servants
taine
was
dying
the
physician
who
met
taine
at
the
door
answered
her
look
of
inquiry
with
your
husband
is
very
near
the
end
madam
beside
the
bed
sat
louise
wringing
her
hands
and
moaning
james
rutlidge
stood
near
without
speaking
taine
went
forward
the
doctor
bending
over
his
patient
with
his
fingers
upon
the
wrist
said
taine
taine
your
wife
is
here
in
response
the
eyes
deep
sunken
under
the
wrinkled
brow
opened
the
loosely
hanging
sensual
lips
quivered
the
physician
spoke
again
your
wife
is
here
mr
taine
a
sudden
gleam
of
light
flared
up
in
the
glazed
eyes
the
doctor
could
have
sworn
that
the
lips
were
twisted
into
a
shadow
of
a
ghastly
mocking
smile
as
if
summoning
by
a
supreme
effort
of
his
will
from
some
unguessed
depths
of
his
being
the
last
remnant
of
his
remaining
strength
the
man
looked
about
the
room
and
in
a
hoarse
whisper
said
send
the
others
away
everybody
but
her
o
papa
papa
exclaimed
poor
louise
protestingly
never

the
whispered
answer
from
the
bed

be
game
girl
game
as
your
father
take
her
away
jim
as
the
physician
passed
taine
who
had
thus
far
stood
like
a
statue
seemingly
incapable
of
thought
or
feeling
or
movement
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
will
be
just
outside
the
door
madam
easily
within
call
when
only
the
woman
was
left
in
the
room
with
her
husband
the
dying
man
spoke
again
come
here
stand
where
i
can
see
you
mechanically
she
obeyed
moving
to
a
position
near
the
foot
of
the
bed
after
a
moment
silence
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
rallying
the
very
last
of
his
vital
forces
for
the
effort
he
said
well
the
game
is
played
out
you
think
you
the
winner
you
wrong
damn
you
wrong
i
was
so
drunk
that
i
could
see
his
face
twisted
in
a
hideous
malicious
grin
you
love
that
artist
fellow
your
interest
in
his
art
is
all
rot
it
you
want
and
you
you
have
been
thinking

him
with
my
money
the
same
as
i
got
you
but
you
wo
you
lost
him
already
i
glad

him
damn

because
i
know
that
after
what
he

of
me
even
if

that
mountain
girl
he
would
wipe
his
feet
on
you
tortured
me
you
mocked
and
sneered
and
laughed
at
me
in
my
suffering

and
i
tried
my
damnedest
to

as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
the
game
but
you
lost
you

i
saw
your
love
for
him
in
your
face
as
i
have
seen
it
every
time
you
two
were
together
i
saw
his
love
for
the
girl
too
and
i
saw
that
you
saw
it
i
i
would
would
die
until
i
told
you
that
i
knew
he
paused
to
gather
his
strength
for
the
last
evil
effort
of
his
evil
life
the
woman
who
had
stood
frozen
with
horror
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
of
the
dying
man
as
though
under
a
dreadful
spell
cowered
before
him
livid
with
fear
cringing
helpless
as
though
before
some
infernal
monster
she
hid
her
face
while
her
husband
struggling
for
breath
to
make
her
hear
called
her
every
foul
name
he
could
master
derided
her
with
fiendish
glee
mocked
her
taunted
her
cursed
her
with
words
too
vile
to
print
with
an
oath
and
a
profane
wish
for
her
future
upon
his
lips
the
end
came
the
sensual
mouth
opened
the
diseased
wasted
limbs
shuddered
the
insane
light
in
the
eyes
went
out
with
a
scream
taine
sank
unconscious
upon
the
floor
beside
the
bed
from
the
lower
part
of
the
house
came
the
faint
sounds
of
the
few
remaining
revelers
when
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
left
the
house
on
fairlands
heights
that
night
they
walked
quickly
as
though
eager
to
escape
from
the
brilliantly
lighted
vicinity
neither
spoke
until
they
were
some
distance
away
then
the
novelist
checking
his
quick
stride
pointed
toward
the
shadowy
bulk
of
the
mountains
that
heaved
their
mighty
crests
and
peaks
in
solemn
grandeur
high
into
the
midnight
sky
well
boy
he
said
the
mountains
are
still
there
it
good
to
see
them
again
is
it
reaching
home
the
older
man
bade
his
friend
good
night
but
the
artist
declaring
that
he
was
not
yet
ready
to
turn
in
went
with
pipe
and
czar
for
company
to
sit
for
a
while
on
the
porch
looking
away
over
the
dark
mass
of
the
orange
groves
to
the
distant
peaks
he
lived
over
again
in
his
thoughts
those
weeks
of
comradeship
with
sibyl
andr√©s
in
the
hills
every
incident
of
their
friendship
he
recalled
every
hour
they
had
spent
together
amid
the
scenes
she
loved
reviewing
every
conversation
questioning
searching
wondering
hoping
fearing
later
he
went
out
into
the
rose
garden
her
garden
where
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
she
tended
with
such
loving
care
in
the
soft
still
darkness
of
the
night
the
place
seemed
haunted
by
her
presence
quietly
he
moved
here
and
there
among
the
roses
to
the
little
gate
in
the
ragged
robin
hedge
through
which
she
came
and
went
to
the
arbor
where
she
had
watched
him
at
his
work
and
to
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
day
after
day
with
hands
outstretched
in
greeting
while
he
worked
to
make
the
colors
and
lines
upon
his
canvas
tell
the
secret
of
her
loveliness
he
remembered
how
he
had
felt
her
presence
in
those
days
when
he
had
laughingly
insisted
to
conrad
lagrange
that
the
place
was
haunted
he
remembered
how
even
when
she
was
unknown
to
him
her
music
had
always
moved
him
how
her
message
from
the
hills
had
seemed
to
call
to
the
best
that
was
in
him
so
it
was
that
as
he
recalled
these
things
as
he
lived
again
the
days
of
his
companionship
with
her
and
realized
how
she
had
come
into
his
life
how
she
had
appealed
always
to
the
best
of
him
and
satisfied
always
his
best
needs
he
came
to
know
the
answer
to
his
questions
to
his
doubts
and
fears
and
hopes
there
in
the
rose
garden
with
its
dark
walls
of
hedge
and
vine
and
grove
in
the
still
night
under
the
stars
with
his
face
to
the
distant
mountains
he
knew
that
the
mountain
girl
would
not
deny
him
that
when
she
was
ready
she
would
come
to
him
in
the
hour
when
taine
with
the
last
strength
of
his
evil
life
profanely
cursed
the
woman
that
his
gold
had
bought
to
serve
his
licentious
will
and
cursing
died
aaron
king
inspired
by
the
character
and
purity
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
by
whom
he
knew
he
was
loved
and
dreaming
of
their
comradeship
that
was
to
be
dedicated
himself
anew
to
the
ministry
of
his
art
and
so
entered
into
that
more
abundant
life
which
belongs
by
divine
right
to
all
who
will
claim
it
but
it
was
not
given
aaron
king
to
know
that
before
sibyl
andr√©s
could
come
to
him
he
must
be
tested
by
a
trial
that
would
tax
his
manhood
best
strength
to
the
uttermost
in
that
night
of
his
awakened
love
as
he
dreamed
of
the
days
of
its
realization
the
man
did
not
know
that
the
days
of
his
testing
were
so
near
at
hand
chapter
xxxi
as
the
world
sees
it
was
three
days
after
the
incidents
just
related
when
an
automobile
from
fairlands
heights
stopped
at
the
home
of
aaron
king
and
the
novelist
taine
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled
went
alone
to
the
house
where
yee
kee
appeared
in
answer
to
her
ring
there
was
no
one
at
home
the
chinaman
said
he
did
not
know
where
the
artist
was
he
had
gone
off
somewhere
with
lagrange
and
the
dog
perhaps
they
would
return
in
a
few
minutes
perhaps
not
until
dinner
time
taine
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
see
king
she
was
going
away
and
must
see
him
if
possible
before
she
left
she
would
come
in
and
if
yee
kee
would
get
her
pen
and
paper
would
write
a
little
note
explaining
in
case
she
should
miss
him
the
chinaman
silently
placed
the
writing
material
before
her
and
disappeared
before
sitting
down
to
her
letter
the
woman
paced
the
floor
restlessly
in
nervous
agitation
her
face
when
she
had
thrown
back
the
veil
appeared
old
and
worn
with
dark
circles
under
the
eyes
and
a
drawn
look
to
the
weary
downward
droop
of
the
lips
as
she
moved
about
the
room
nervously
fingering
the
books
and
trifles
upon
the
table
or
the
mantle
she
seemed
beside
herself
with
anxiety
she
went
to
the
window
to
stand
looking
out
as
if
hoping
for
the
return
of
the
artist
she
went
to
the
open
door
of
his
bedroom
her
hands
clenched
her
limbs
trembling
her
face
betraying
the
agony
of
her
mind
with
louise
she
was
leaving
that
evening
at
four
for
the
east
with
the
body
of
her
husband
she
could
not
go
without
seeing
again
the
man
whom
as
taine
had
rightly
said
she
loved
loved
with
the
only
love
of
which
because
of
her
environment
and
life
she
was
capable
she
still
believed
in
her
power
over
him
whose
passion
she
had
besieged
with
all
the
lure
of
her
physical
beauty
but
that
which
she
had
seen
in
his
face
as
he
had
watched
the
girl
musician
the
night
of
the
dinner
filled
her
with
fear
presently
in
her
desperation
when
the
artist
did
not
return
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
to
put
upon
paper
as
best
she
could
the
things
she
had
come
to
say
her
letter
finished
she
looked
at
her
watch
calling
the
chinaman
she
asked
for
a
key
to
the
studio
explaining
that
she
wished
to
see
her
picture
she
still
hoped
for
the
artist
return
and
that
her
letter
would
not
be
necessary
she
hoped
too
that
in
her
portrait
which
she
had
not
yet
seen
she
might
find
some
evidence
of
the
painter
passion
for
her
she
had
not
forgotten
his
saying
that
he
would
put
upon
the
canvas
what
he
thought
of
her
nor
could
she
fail
to
recall
his
manner
and
her
interpretation
of
it
as
he
had
worked
upon
the
picture
in
the
studio
she
stood
before
the
easel
scarce
daring
to
draw
the
curtain
but
calling
up
in
her
mind
the
emotions
and
thoughts
of
the
hours
she
had
spent
in
that
room
alone
with
the
artist
she
was
made
bold
by
her
reestablished
belief
in
his
passion
and
by
her
convictions
that
were
founded
upon
her
own
desires
under
the
stimulating
influence
of
her
thoughts
a
flush
of
color
stole
into
her
cheeks
her
eyes
grew
bright
with
the
light
of
triumphant
anticipation
with
an
eager
hand
she
boldly
drew
aside
the
curtain
the
picture
upon
the
easel
was
the
artist
portrait
of
sibyl
andr√©s
with
an
exclamation
that
was
not
unlike
fear
taine
drew
back
from
the
canvas
looking
at
the
beautiful
painting
in
which
the
artist
had
pictured
with
unconscious
love
and
an
almost
religious
fidelity
the
spirit
of
the
girl
who
was
so
like
the
flowers
among
which
she
stood
the
woman
was
moved
by
many
conflicting
emotions
surprise
disappointment
admiration
envy
jealousy
sadness
regret
and
anger
swept
over
her
blinded
by
bitter
tears
with
a
choking
sob
in
an
agony
of
remorse
and
shame
she
turned
away
her
face
from
the
gaze
of
those
pure
eyes
then
as
the
flame
of
her
passion
withered
her
shame
hot
rage
dried
her
tears
and
she
sprang
forward
with
an
fierceness
to
destroy
the
picture
but
even
as
she
put
forth
her
hand
she
hesitated
and
drew
back
afraid
as
she
stood
thus
in
doubt
halting
between
her
impulse
and
her
fear
a
sound
at
the
door
behind
her
drew
her
attention
she
turned
to
face
the
beautiful
original
of
the
portrait
instantly
the
woman
of
the
world
had
herself
perfectly
in
hand
sibyl
andr√©s
drew
back
with
an
embarrassed
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
and
would
have
fled
but
taine
with
perfect
cordiality
said
quickly
o
how
do
you
do
miss
andr√©s
come
in
she
seemed
so
sincere
in
the
welcome
that
was
implied
in
her
voice
and
manner
while
her
face
together
with
her
somber
garb
of
mourning
was
so
expressive
of
sadness
and
grief
that
the
girl
gentle
heart
was
touched
going
forward
with
that
natural
dignity
that
belongs
to
those
whose
minds
and
hearts
are
unsullied
by
habitual
pretense
of
feeling
and
sham
emotions
sibyl
spoke
a
few
well
chosen
words
of
sympathy
taine
received
the
girl
expression
of
condolence
with
a
manner
that
was
perfect
in
its
semblance
of
carefully
controlled
sorrow
and
grief
yet
managed
skillfully
to
suggest
the
wide
social
distance
that
separated
the
widow
of
taine
from
the
unknown
mountain
girl
then
as
if
courageously
determined
not
to
dwell
upon
her
bereavement
she
said
i
was
just
looking
again
at
king
picture
for
which
you
posed
it
is
beautiful
is
it
he
told
me
that
you
were
an
exceptionally
clever
model
quite
the
best
he
has
ever
had
the
girl
disarmed
by
her
own
genuine
feeling
of
sympathy
for
the
speaker
was
troubled
at
something
that
seemed
to
lie
beneath
the
kindly
words
of
the
experienced
woman
to
me
it
is
beautiful
she
returned
doubtfully
but
of
course
i
do
know
lagrange
thinks
though
that
it
is
really
a
splendid
portrait
taine
smiled
with
a
confident
air
as
one
might
smile
at
a
child
lagrange
my
dear
is
a
famous
novelist
but
he
really
knows
very
little
of
pictures
perhaps
you
are
right
returned
sibyl
simply
but
the
picture
is
not
to
be
shown
as
a
portrait
of
me
at
all
again
that
knowing
smile
so
i
understand
of
course
under
the
circumstances
you
would
scarcely
expect
it
would
you
sibyl
not
in
the
least
understanding
what
the
woman
meant
answered
doubtfully
no
i
i
did
not
wish
it
shown
as
my
portrait
taine
studying
the
girl
face
became
very
earnest
in
her
kindly
interest
as
if
moved
out
of
the
goodness
of
her
heart
she
stooped
from
her
high
place
to
advise
and
counsel
one
of
her
own
sex
who
was
so
wholly
ignorant
of
the
world
i
fear
my
dear
that
you
know
very
little
of
artists
and
their
methods
to
which
the
girl
replied
i
never
knew
an
artist
before
i
met
king
this
summer
in
the
mountains
still
watching
her
face
closely
taine
said
with
gentle
solicitude
may
i
tell
you
something
for
your
own
good
miss
andr√©s
certainly
if
you
please
mrs
taine
an
artist
said
the
older
woman
carefully
with
an
air
of
positive
knowledge
must
find
the
subjects
for
his
pictures
in
life
as
he
goes
about
he
is
constantly
on
the
for
new
faces
or
figures
that
are
of
interest
to
him
or
that
may
be
used
by
him
to
make
pictures
of
interest
the
subjects
or
i
should
say
the
people
who
pose
for
him
are
nothing
at
all
to
the
artist
aside
from
his
picture
you
see
no
more
than
his
paints
and
brushes
and
canvas
often
they
are
professional
models
whom
he
hires
as
one
hires
any
sort
of
service
you
know
sometimes
she
paused
as
if
hesitating
then
continued
gently
sometimes
they
are
people
like
yourself
who
happen
to
appeal
to
his
artistic
fancy
and
whom
he
can
persuade
to
pose
for
him
the
girl
face
was
white
she
stared
at
the
woman
with
pleading
frightened
dismay
she
made
a
pitiful
attempt
to
speak
but
could
not
the
older
woman
watching
her
continued
forgive
me
dear
child
i
do
not
wish
to
hurt
you
but
king
is
careless
i
told
him
he
should
be
careful
that
you
did
not
misunderstand
his
interest
in
you
but
he
laughed
at
me
he
said
that
it
was
your
that
he
wanted
to
paint
and
cautioned
me
not
to
warn
you
until
his
picture
was
finished
she
turned
to
look
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
with
the
air
of
a
critic
he
really
caught
it
very
well
aaron
king
is
so
good
at
that
sort
of
thing
he
never
permits
his
models
to
know
exactly
what
he
is
after
you
see
but
leads
them
cleverly
to
exhibit
unconsciously
the
particular
thing
that
he
wishes
to
get
into
his
picture
when
the
tortured
girl
had
been
given
time
to
grasp
the
full
import
of
her
words
the
woman
said
again
turning
toward
sibyl
as
she
spoke
with
a
smiling
air
that
was
intended
to
show
the
intimacy
between
herself
and
the
artist
have
you
seen
his
portrait
of
me
no
faltered
sibyl
king
told
me
not
to
look
at
it
it
has
always
been
covered
when
i
have
been
in
the
studio
again
taine
smiled
as
though
there
was
some
reason
known
only
to
herself
and
the
painter
why
he
did
not
wish
the
girl
to
see
the
portrait
and
do
you
come
to
the
studio
often
alone
as
you
came
she
asked
still
kindly
as
though
from
her
experience
she
was
seeking
to
counsel
the
girl
i
mean
have
you
been
coming
since
the
picture
for
which
you
posed
was
finished
the
girl
white
cheeks
grew
red
with
embarrassment
and
shame
as
she
answered
falteringly
yes
you
poor
child
really
i
must
scold
aaron
for
this
after
my
warning
him
too
that
people
were
talking
about
his
intimacy
with
you
in
the
mountains
it
is
quite
too
bad
of
him
he
will
ruin
himself
if
he
is
not
more
careful
she
seemed
sincerely
troubled
over
the
situation
i
i
do
not
understand
taine
faltered
sibyl
do
you
mean
that
my
that
king
friendship
for
me
has
harmed
him
that
i
that
it
is
wrong
for
me
to
come
here
surely
miss
andr√©s
you
must
understand
what
i
mean
no
i
i
do
not
know
tell
me
please
taine
hesitated
as
though
reluctant
then
as
if
forced
by
her
sense
of
duty
she
spoke
the
truth
is
my
dear
that
your
being
with
king
in
the
mountains
going
to
his
camp
as
familiarly
as
you
did
and
spending
so
much
time
alone
with
him
in
the
hills
and
then
your
coming
here
so
often
has
led
people
to
say
unpleasant
things
but
what
do
people
say
persisted
sibyl
the
answer
came
with
cruel
deliberateness
that
you
are
not
only
king
model
but
that
you
are
his
mistress
as
well
sibyl
andr√©s
shrank
back
from
the
woman
as
though
she
had
received
a
blow
in
the
face
her
cheeks
and
brow
and
neck
were
crimson
with
a
little
cry
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
kind
voice
of
the
older
woman
continued
you
see
dear
whether
it
is
true
or
not
the
effect
is
exactly
the
same
if
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
your
relations
to
king
are
are
wrong
it
is
as
bad
as
though
it
were
actually
true
i
felt
that
i
must
tell
you
child
not
alone
for
your
own
good
but
for
the
sake
of
king
and
his
work
for
the
sake
of
his
position
in
the
world
frankly
if
you
continue
to
compromise
him
and
his
good
name
by
coming
like
this
to
his
studio
it
will
ruin
him
the
world
may
not
care
particularly
whether
king
keeps
a
mistress
or
not
but
people
will
not
countenance
his
open
association
with
her
even
under
the
pretext
that
she
is
a
model
as
she
finished
taine
looked
at
her
watch
dear
me
i
really
must
be
going
i
have
already
spent
more
time
than
i
intended
miss
andr√©s
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
have
hurt
you
the
girl
looked
at
her
with
the
pain
and
terror
filled
eyes
of
some
gentle
wild
creature
that
can
not
understand
the
cruelty
of
the
trap
that
holds
it
fast
yes
yes
i
i
suppose
you
know
best
you
must
know
more
than
i
thank
you
taine
i
when
taine
was
gone
sibyl
andr√©s
sat
for
a
little
while
before
her
portrait
wondering
dumbly
at
the
happiness
of
that
face
upon
the
canvas
there
were
no
tears
she
could
not
cry
her
eyes
burned
hot
and
dry
her
lips
were
parched
rising
she
drew
the
curtain
carefully
to
hide
the
picture
and
started
toward
the
door
she
paused
going
to
the
easel
that
held
the
other
picture
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
curtain
again
she
paused
aaron
king
had
said
that
she
must
not
look
at
that
picture
conrad
lagrange
had
said
that
she
must
not
why
she
did
not
know
why
perhaps
if
the
mountain
girl
had
drawn
aside
the
curtain
and
had
looked
upon
the
face
of
taine
as
aaron
king
had
painted
it
perhaps
the
rest
of
my
story
would
not
have
happened
but
true
to
the
wish
of
her
friends
even
in
her
misery
sibyl
andr√©s
held
her
hand
at
the
door
of
the
studio
she
turned
again
to
look
long
and
lingeringly
about
the
room
then
she
went
out
closing
and
locking
the
door
and
leaving
the
key
on
a
hidden
nail
as
her
custom
was
going
slowly
lingeringly
through
the
rose
garden
to
the
little
gate
in
the
hedge
she
disappeared
in
the
orange
grove
aaron
king
and
conrad
lagrange
returning
from
a
long
walk
overtook
myra
willard
who
was
returning
from
town
just
as
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
arrived
at
the
gate
of
the
little
house
in
the
orange
grove
for
a
moment
the
three
stood
chatting
as
neighbors
will
then
the
two
men
went
on
to
their
own
home
czar
racing
ahead
announced
their
coming
to
yee
kee
and
the
chinaman
met
them
as
they
entered
the
telling
them
of
taine
visit
he
gave
aaron
king
the
letter
that
she
had
left
for
him
as
the
artist
conscious
of
the
scrutinizing
gaze
of
his
friend
read
the
closely
written
pages
his
cheeks
flushed
with
embarrassment
and
shame
when
he
had
finished
he
faced
the
novelist
eyes
steadily
and
without
speaking
deliberately
and
methodically
tore
taine
letter
into
tiny
fragments
dropping
the
scraps
of
paper
into
the
waste
basket
he
dusted
his
hands
together
with
a
significant
gesture
and
looked
at
his
watch
her
train
left
at
four
it
is
now
for
which
returned
conrad
lagrange
solemnly
let
us
give
thanks
as
the
novelist
spoke
czar
on
the
porch
outside
gave
a
low
woof
that
signalized
the
approach
of
a
friend
looking
through
the
open
door
they
saw
myra
willard
coming
hurriedly
up
the
walk
they
could
see
that
the
woman
was
greatly
agitated
and
went
quicklv
forward
to
meet
her
women
of
myra
willard
strength
of
character
particularly
those
who
have
passed
through
the
furnace
of
some
terrible
experience
as
she
so
evidently
had
are
not
given
to
loud
uncontrolled
expression
of
emotion
that
she
was
alarmed
and
troubled
was
evident
her
face
was
white
her
eyes
were
frightened
and
she
trembled
so
that
aaron
king
helped
her
to
a
seat
but
she
told
them
clearly
with
no
unnecessary
hysterical
exclamations
what
had
happened
upon
entering
the
house
after
parting
from
the
two
men
at
the
gate
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
found
a
letter
from
sibyl
the
girl
was
gone
as
she
spoke
she
handed
the
letter
to
conrad
lagrange
who
read
it
and
gave
it
to
the
artist
it
was
a
pitiful
little
note
rather
vague
saying
only
that
she
must
go
away
at
once
assuring
myra
that
she
had
not
meant
to
do
wrong
asking
her
to
tell
king
and
the
novelist
and
begging
the
artist
forgiveness
that
she
had
not
understood
aaron
king
looked
from
the
letter
in
his
hand
to
the
faces
of
his
two
friends
in
consternation
do
you
understand
this
miss
willard
he
asked
when
he
could
speak
the
woman
shook
her
head
only
that
something
has
happened
to
make
the
child
think
that
her
friendship
with
you
has
injured
you
and
that
she
has
gone
away
for
your
sake
she
she
thought
so
much
of
you
mr
king
and
i
i
love
her
miss
willard
i
should
have
told
you
soon
i
tell
you
now
to
reassure
you
i
love
her
aaron
king
made
his
declaration
to
his
two
friends
with
a
simple
dignity
but
with
a
feeling
that
thrilled
them
with
the
force
of
his
earnestness
and
the
purity
and
strength
of
his
passion
conrad
lagrange
scarred
by
his
years
of
contact
with
the
unclean
the
vicious
and
debasing
passions
of
mankind
grasped
the
young
man
hand
while
his
eyes
shone
with
an
emotion
his
habitual
reserve
could
not
conceal
i
glad
for
you
aaron
he
said
adding
reverently
as
your
mother
would
be
glad
i
have
known
that
you
would
tell
me
this
sometime
king
said
myra
willard
i
knew
it
i
think
before
you
yourself
realized
and
i
too
am
glad
glad
for
my
girl
because
i
know
what
such
a
love
will
mean
to
her
but
why
why
has
she
gone
like
this
where
has
she
gone
oh
my
girl
my
girl
for
a
moment
the
distracted
woman
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
down
but
with
an
effort
of
her
will
she
controlled
herself
it
clear
enough
what
has
sent
her
away
growled
conrad
lagrange
with
a
warning
glance
to
the
artist
some
one
has
filled
her
mind
with
the
notion
that
her
friendship
with
aaron
has
been
causing
talk
i
think
there
no
doubt
as
to
where
she
gone
you
mean
the
mountains
asked
myra
willard
quickly
yes
i
stake
my
life
that
she
has
gone
straight
to
brian
oakley
think
where
else
she
go
she
has
sometimes
borrowed
a
from
your
neighbor
up
the
road
has
she
miss
willard
asked
aaron
king
yes
i
run
over
there
at
once
conrad
lagrange
spoke
quickly
do
let
them
think
anything
unusual
has
happened
we
go
over
to
your
house
and
wait
for
you
there
fifteen
minutes
later
myra
willard
returned
sibyl
had
borrowed
the
horse
asking
them
if
she
might
keep
it
until
the
next
day
she
did
not
say
where
she
was
going
she
had
left
about
four
that
will
put
her
at
brian
by
nine
said
the
novelist
and
i
will
arrive
there
about
the
same
time
added
aaron
king
eagerly
it
now
she
has
an
hour
start
but
i
ride
an
hour
harder
with
an
automobile
you
could
overtake
her
said
myra
willard
i
know
returned
the
artist
but
if
i
take
a
horse
we
can
ride
back
together
he
started
through
the
grove
toward
the
other
house

a
run
chapter
xxxii
the
mysterious
disappearance
by
the
time
aaron
king
had
found
a
and
was
ready
to
start
on
his
ride
it
was
six
granting
that
conrad
lagrange
was
right
in
his
supposition
that
the
girl
had
left
with
the
intention
of
going
to
brian
oakley
the
artist
could
scarcely
now
hope
to
arrive
at
the
ranger
station
until
some
time
after
sibyl
had
reached
the
home
of
her
friends
unless
she
should
stop
somewhere
on
the
way
which
he
did
not
think
likely
once
as
he
realized
how
the
minutes
were
slipping
away
he
was
on
the
point
of
reconsidering
his
reply
to
myra
willard
suggestion
that
he
take
an
automobile
then
telling
himself
that
he
would
surely
find
sibyl
at
the
station
and
thinking
of
the
return
trip
with
her
he
determined
to
carry
out
his
first
plan
but
when
he
was
finally
on
the
road
he
did
not
ride
with
less
haste
because
he
no
longer
expected
to
overtake
sibyl
in
spite
of
his
reassuring
himself
again
and
again
that
the
girl
he
loved
was
safe
his
mind
was
too
disturbed
by
the
situation
to
permit
of
his
riding
leisurely
beyond
the
outskirts
of
the
city
with
his
horse
warmed
to
its
work
the
artist
pushed
his
mount
harder
and
harder
until
the
animal
reached
the
limit
of
a
pace
that
its
rider
felt
it
could
endure
for
the
distance
they
had
to
go
over
the
way
that
he
and
conrad
lagrange
had
walked
with
czar
and
croesus
so
leisurely
he
went
now
with
such
hot
haste
that
the
people
in
the
homes
in
the
orange
groves
sitting
down
to
their
evening
meal
paused
to
listen
to
the
sharp
ringing
beat
of
the
galloping
hoofs
two
or
three
travelers
as
he
passed
watched
him
out
of
sight
with
wondering
gaze
those
he
met
turned
their
heads
to
look
after
him
aaron
king
thoughts
as
he
rode
kept
pace
with
his
horse
flying
feet
the
points
along
the
way
where
he
and
the
famous
novelist
had
stopped
to
rest
and
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
the
scene
recalled
vividly
to
his
mind
all
that
those
weeks
in
the
mountains
had
brought
to
him
backward
from
that
day
when
he
had
for
the
first
time
set
his
face
toward
the
hills
his
mind
traveled
almost
from
day
to
day
until
he
stood
again
in
that
impoverished
home
of
his
boyhood
to
which
he
had
been
summoned
from
his
studies
abroad
as
he
urged
his
laboring
horse
forward
in
the
eagerness
and
anxiety
of
his
love
for
sibyl
andr√©s
he
lived
again
that
hour
when
his
dying
mother
told
her
faltering
story
of
his
father
dishonor
when
he
knew
for
the
first
time
her
life
of
devotion
to
him
and
learned
of
her
sacrifice
even
unto
poverty
that
he
might
unhampered
be
fitted
for
his
life
work
and
when
receiving
his
inheritance
he
had
made
his
solemn
promise
that
the
purpose
and
passion
of
his
mother
years
of
sacrifice
should
in
him
and
in
his
work
be
fulfilled
one
by
one
he
retraced
the
steps
that
had
led
to
his
understanding
that
only
a
true
and
noble
art
could
ever
make
good
that
promise
not
by
winning
the
poor
notice
of
the
little
passing
day
alone
not
by
gaining
the
applause
of
the
thoughtless
crowd
not
by
winning
the
rewards
bestowed
by
the
judges
and
patrons
of
the
arts
but
by
a
true
honest
and
fearless
giving
of
himself
in
his
work
regardless
alike
of
praise
or
blame
by
saying
the
thing
that
was
given
him
to
say
because
it
was
given
him
to
say
would
he
keep
that
which
his
mother
had
committed
to
him
as
mile
after
mile
of
the
distance
that
lay
between
him
and
the
girl
he
loved
was
put
behind
him
in
his
race
to
her
side
it
was
given
him
to
understand
as
never
before
how
first
the
friendship
of
the
man
who
had
himself
profaned
his
art
and
then
the
comradeship
of
that
one
whose
life
was
so
unspotted
by
the
world
had
helped
him
to
a
true
and
vital
conception
of
his
ministry
of
color
and
line
and
brush
and
canvas
it
was
twilight
when
the
artist
reached
the
spot
where
the
road
crosses
the
tumbling
stream
the
spot
where
he
and
conrad
lagrange
had
slept
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
where
the
road
curves
toward
the
creek
the
man
without
checking
his
pace
turned
his
head
to
look
back
upon
the
valley
that
far
below
was
fast
being
lost
in
the
gathering
dusk
in
its
weird
and
gloomy
mystery
with
its
hidden
life
revealed
only
by
the
sparkling
twinkling
lights
of
the
towns
and
cities
it
was
suggestive
now
to
his
artist
mind
of
the
life
that
had
so
nearly
caught
him
in
its
glittering
sensual
snare
a
moment
later
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
mountain
peaks
ahead
that
still
in
the
light
of
the
western
sun
glowed
as
though
brushed
with
living
fire
against
the
sky
he
could
distinguish
that
peak
in
the
galena
range
with
the
clump
of
pines
where
he
had
sat
with
sibyl
andr√©s
that
day
when
she
had
tried
to
make
him
see
the
train
that
had
brought
him
to
fairlands
he
wondered
now
as
he
rode
why
he
had
not
realized
his
love
for
the
girl
before
they
left
the
hills
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
his
love
was
born
that
evening
when
he
had
first
heard
her
violin
as
he
was
fishing
when
he
had
watched
her
from
the
cedar
thicket
as
she
made
her
music
of
the
mountains
and
as
she
danced
in
the
grassy
yard
why
he
asked
himself
had
he
not
been
conscious
of
his
love
in
those
days
when
she
came
to
him
in
the
spring
glade
and
in
the
days
that
followed
why
had
he
not
known
when
he
painted
her
portrait
in
the
rose
garden
why
had
the
awakening
not
come
until
that
night
when
he
saw
her
in
the
company
of
revelers
at
the
big
house
on
fairlands
heights
the
night
that
taine
died
it
was
dark
before
he
reached
the
canyon
gates
in
the
blackness
of
the
gorge
with
only
the
light
of
a
narrow
strip
of
stars
overhead
he
was
forced
to
ride
more
slowly
but
his
confidence
that
he
would
find
her
at
the
ranger
station
had
increased
as
he
approached
the
scenes
of
her
girlhood
home
to
go
to
her
friends
seemed
so
inevitably
the
thing
that
she
would
do
a
few
miles
farther
now
and
he
would
see
her
he
would
tell
her
why
he
had
come
he
would
claim
the
love
that
he
knew
was
his
and
so
with
a
better
heart
he
permitted
his
tired
horse
to
slacken
the
pace
he
even
smiled
to
think
of
her
surprise
when
she
should
see
him
it
was
a
little
past
nine
when
the
artist
saw
through
the
trees
the
lights
in
the
windows
at
the
station
and
dismounted
to
open
the
gate
hiding
up
to
the
house
he
gave
the
old
familiar
hail
the
door
opened
and
with
the
flood
of
light
that
streamed
out
came
the
tall
form
of
brian
oakley
hello
seems
to
me
i
ought
to
know
that
voice
the
artist
laughed
nervously
it
me
all
right
brian
what
there
is
left
of
me
aaron
king
by
all
that
holy
cried
the
ranger
coming
quickly
down
the
steps
and
toward
the
shadowy
horseman
what
the
matter
anything
wrong
with
sibyl
or
myra
willard
what
brings
you
up
here
this
time
of
night
aaron
king
heard
the
questions
with
sinking
heart
but
so
certain
had
he
come
to
feel
that
the
girl
would
be
at
the
station
that
he
said
mechanically
as
he
dropped
wearily
from
his
horse
to
grasp
his
hand
i
followed
sibyl
how
long
has
she
been
here
brian
oakley
spoke
quickly
sibyl
is
not
here
aaron
the
artist
caught
the
ranger
arm
do
you
mean
brian
that
she
has
not
been
here
she
has
not
been
here
returned
the
officer
coolly
good
god
exclaimed
the
other
stunned
and
bewildered
by
the
positive
words
blindly
he
turned
toward
his
horse
brian
oakley
stepping
forward
put
his
hand
on
the
artist
shoulder
come
old
man
pull
yourself
together
and
let
a
little
light
in
on
this
matter
he
said
calmly
tell
me
what
has
happened
why
did
you
expect
to
find
sibyl
here
when
aaron
king
had
finished
his
story
the
other
said
still
without
excitement
come
into
the
house
you
about
all
in
i
heard
doctor
gordan
going
up
the
canyon
to
morton
about
an
hour
ago
their
baby
sick
if
sibyl
was
on
the
road
he
would
have
passed
her
throw
the
saddle
on
max
and
we
run
over
there
and
see
what
he
knows
but
first
you
got
to
have
a
bite
to
eat
the
young
man
protested
but
the
ranger
said
firmly
you
can
eat
while
i
saddle
come
i
wish
mary
was
home
he
added
as
he
set
out
some
cold
meat
and
bread
she
is
in
los
angeles
with
her
sister
i
call
you
when
i
ready
he
spoke
the
last
word
from
the
door
as
he
went
out
the
artist
tried
to
eat
but
with
little
success
he
was
again
mounted
and
ready
to
go
when
the
ranger
rode
up
from
the
barn
on
the
chestnut
when
they
reached
the
point
where
the
road
to
morton
ranch
leaves
the
main
canyon
road
brian
oakley
said
it
barely
possible
that
she
went
on
up
to
carleton
but
i
think
we
better
go
to
morton
and
see
the
doctor
first
we
do
want
to
miss
him
did
you
meet
any
one
as
you
came
up
i
mean
after
you
got
within
two
or
three
miles
of
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
no
replied
the
other
why
a
man
on
a
horse
passed
the
station
about
seven
going
down
where
did
the
doctor
pass
you
he
did
pass
me
what
said
the
ranger
sharply
no
one
passed
me
after
i
left
fairlands
if
doc
left
town
before
you
he
must
have
had
a
puncture
or
something
or
he
would
have
passed
the
station
before
he
did
it
was
ten
when
the
two
men
arrived
at
the
morton
ranch
we
do
want
to
start
any
excitement
said
the
officer
as
they
drew
rein
at
the
corral
gate
you
stay
here
and
i
drop
in
casual
like
it
seemed
to
aaron
king
waiting
in
the
darkness
that
his
companion
was
gone
for
hours
in
reality
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
until
the
ranger
returned
he
was
walking
quickly
and
springing
into
the
saddle
he
started
the
chestnut
off
at
a
sharp
lope
the
baby
is
better
he
said
doctor
was
here
this
afternoon
started
home
about
two
that
must
have
gone
on
up
the
canyon
morton
knew
nothing
of
the
man
on
horseback
who
went
down
we
cut
across
to
carleton
presently
the
ranger
swung
the
chestnut
aside
from
the
wagon
road
to
follow
a
narrow
trail
through
the
chaparral
to
the
artist
the
little
path
in
the
darkness
was
invisible
but
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
followed
the
shadowy
form
ahead
of
an
hour
later
they
came
out
into
the
main
road
again
near
the
carleton
ranch
corral
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
old
camp
in
the
sycamores
behind
the
orchard
of
the
deserted
place
it
was
now
eleven
and
the
was
dark
without
dismounting
brian
oakley
called
hello
henry
there
was
no
answer
moving
his
horse
close
to
the
window
of
the
room
where
he
knew
the
rancher
slept
the
ranger
tapped
on
the
sash
henry
turn
out
i
want
to
see
you
it
oakley
a
moment
later
the
sash
was
raised
and
carleton
asked
what
is
it
brian
what
up
is
sibyl
stopping
with
you
folks
sibyl
have
seen
her
since
they
went
down
from
their
summer
camp
what
the
matter
briefly
the
ranger
explained
the
situation
the
rancher
interrupted
only
to
greet
the
artist
with
a
howdy
king
as
the
officer
words
made
known
the
identity
of
his
companion
when
brian
oakley
had
concluded
the
rancher
said
i
heard
that
going
up
and
then
heard
it
going
back
down
again
about
an
hour
ago
you
missed
it
by
turning
off
to
morton
if
you
come
on
straight
up
here
you
a
met
it
did
you
see
the
man
on
horseback
going
down
just
before
dusk
asked
the
officer
yes
but
not
near
enough
to
know
him
you
do
suppose
sibyl
would
go
up
to
her
old
home
do
you
brian
she
might
under
the
circumstances
aaron
and
i
will
ride
up
there
on
the
chance
you
stop
in
on
your
way
back
called
the
rancher
as
the
two
horsemen
moved
away
sure
answered
the
ranger
an
hour
later
they
were
back
they
had
found
the
old
home
under
the
giant
sycamores
on
the
edge
of
the
little
clearing
dark
and
untenanted
lights
were
shining
now
from
the
windows
of
the
carleton
down
at
the
corral
the
twinkling
gleam
of
a
lantern
bobbed
here
and
there
as
the
ranger
and
his
companion
drew
near
the
lantern
came
rapidly
up
the
hill
at
the
porch
they
were
met
by
henry
carleton
his
two
sons
and
a
ranch
hand
as
the
four
stood
in
the
light
of
the
window
and
of
the
lantern
on
the
porch
listening
to
brian
oakley
report
each
held
the
of
a
i
figured
that
the
chance
of
her
being
up
there
was
so
mighty
slim
that
we
better
be
ready
to
ride
when
you
got
back
said
the
mountain
ranchman
what
your
program
brian
thus
simply
he
put
himself
and
his
household
in
command
of
the
ranger
the
officer
turned
to
the
eldest
son
jack
you
got
the
fastest
horse
in
the
outfit
i
want
you
to
go
down
to
the
and
find
out
if
any
one
there
saw
sibyl
anywhere
on
the
road
you
see
he
explained
to
the
group
we
do
know
for
sure
yet
that
she
came
into
the
mountains
while
i
have
a
doubt
but
she
did
we
got
to
know
jack
carleton
was
in
the
saddle
as
the
ranger
finished
the
officer
turned
to
him
again
find
out
what
you
can
about
that
automobile
and
the
man
on
horseback
we
be
at
the
station
when
you
get
back
there
was
a
sharp
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
rider
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
other
members
of
the
little
party
rode
more
leisurely
down
the
canyon
road
to
the
ranger
station
when
they
arrived
at
the
house
brian
oakley
said
make
yourselves
easy
boys
i
going
to
write
a
little
note
he
went
into
the
house
where
as
they
sat
on
the
porch
they
saw
him
through
the
window
his
desk
the
ranger
had
finished
his
letter
and
with
the
sealed
official
envelope
in
his
hand
appeared
in
the
doorway
when
his
messenger
to
the
returned
without
dismounting
the
rider
reined
his
horse
up
to
the
porch
good
time
jack
said
the
officer
quietly
the
young
man
answered
one
of
the
company
men
saw
sibyl
he
was
coming
up
with
a
load
of
supplies
and
she
passed
him
a
mile
below
the
just
before
dark
when
he
was
opening
the
gate
the
automobile
went
by
it
was
too
dark
to
see
how
many
were
in
the
machine
they
heard
the
go
down
the
canyon
again
later
no
one
noticed
the
man
on
horseback
three
company
men
will
be
up
here
at
daybreak
good
boy
said
brian
oakley
again
and
then
for
a
little
no
sound
save
the
soft
clinking
of
bit
or
in
the
darkness
broke
the
hush
that
fell
over
the
little
group
with
faces
turned
toward
their
leader
they
waited
his
word
the
ranger
stood
still
the
long
official
envelope
in
his
hand
when
he
spoke
there
was
a
ring
in
his
voice
that
left
in
the
minds
of
his
companions
no
doubt
as
to
his
view
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
milt
he
said
sharply
the
youngest
of
the
carleton
sons
stepped
forward
yes
sir
you
will
ride
to
fairlands
it
half
past
one
now
you
should
be
back
between
eight
and
nine

the
morning

sheriff
and
bring

while

talking
if
i
not
at
your
house
when
you
get
back
feed
your
horse
and
wait
yes
sir
came
the
answer
and
an
instant
later
the
boy
rider
vanished
into
the
night
while
the
sound
of
the
messenger
going
still
came
to
them
the
ranger
spoke
again
henry
you
ride
to
morton
tell
him
to
be
at
your
place
with
his
crowd
by
daylight
then
go
home

riders

they
come
in
we
have

make

place

center
it
be
hard
on
your
wife

the
girls
but

to
lend
them
a
hand
i
wish
to
god
mary

here
never
mind
about
my
folks
brian
returned
the
rancher
as
he
mounted
you
know
they
be
on
the
job
you
bet
i
know
henry
came
the
answer
as
the
mountaineer
rode
away
then
bill
you
take
every
one
between
here
and
the
head
of
the
canyon
if
there
a
man
shows
up
at
carleton
later
than
an
hour
after
sunup
we
run
him
out
of
the
country
tom
you
take
the
trail
over
into
the
santa
ana
circle
around
to
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
back
up
clear
creek
turn
out
everybody
jack
you
take
the
galena
valley
neighborhood
send
in
your
men
but
do
come
back
yourself
until
found
that
man
who
went
down
the
canyon
on
horseback
when
the
last
rider
was
gone
in
the
darkness
the
ranger
said
to
the
artist
come
aaron
you
must
get
some
rest
there
not
a
thing
more
that
can
be
done
until
daylight
aaron
king
protested
but
strong
as
he
was
the
unusual
exertion
of
his
hours
in
the
saddle
together
with
his
racking
anxiety
had
told
upon
muscles
and
nerves
his
face
pale
and
drawn
gave
the
lie
to
his
words
that
he
was
not
tired
you
must
rest
man
said
brian
oakley
shortly
there
may
be
days
of
this
ahead
of
us
you
got
to
snatch
every
minute
when
it
possible
to
conserve
your
strength
you
already
had
more
than
the
rest
of
us
jerk
off
your
boots
and
lie
down
until
i
call
you
even
if
you
sleep
do
as
i
say
i
boss
here
as
the
artist
obeyed
the
ranger
continued
i
wrote
the
sheriff
all
i
knew
and
some
things
that
i
suspect
it
that
automobile
that
sticks
in
my
mind
that
and
some
other
things
the
machine
must
have
left
fairlands
before
you
did
unless
it
came
over
through
the
galena
valley
from
some
town
on
the
railroad
up
san
gorgonio
pass
way
which
is
likely
if
it
come
from
fairlands
it
must
have
waited
somewhere
along
the
road
to
enter
the
canyon
after
dark
do
you
think
that
any
one
else
besides
myra
willard
and
lagrange
and
you
know
that
sibyl
started
up
here
i
do
think
so
the
neighbor
where
she
borrowed
the
horse
did
know
where
she
was
going
who
saw
her
last
i
think
taine
did
the
artist
had
already
told
the
ranger
about
the
possible
meeting
of
taine
and
sibyl
in
his
studio
said
the
other
taine
left
for
the
east
at
four
you
know
said
the
artist
jim
rutlidge
did
go
you
said
the
ranger
spoke
casually
then
as
if
dismissing
the
matter
he
continued
you
get
some
rest
now
aaron
take
care
of
your
horse
and
saddle
a
fresh
one
for
you
as
soon
as
light
we
ride
i
going
to
find
out
where
that
automobile
went
and
what
for
chapter
xxxiii
beginning
the
search
aaron
king
lay
with
closed
eyes
but
not
asleep
he
was
thinking
thinking
thinking
in
a
weary
circle
his
tired
brain
went
round
and
round
finding
no
place
to
stop
the
man
on
horseback
the
automobile
some
accident
that
might
have
befallen
the
girl
in
her
distraught
state
of
mind
he
could
find
no
place
in
the
weary
treadmill
of
conjecture
to
rest
while
it
was
still
too
dark
to
see
brian
oakley
called
him
and
the
call
was
a
relief
as
the
artist
pulled
on
his
boots
the
ranger
said
it
be
light
enough
to
see
by
the
time
we
get
above
carleton
we
know
the
automobile
went
that
far
anyway
at
the
carleton
ranch
as
they
passed
they
saw
by
the
lights
that
the
mountaineer
family
were
already
making
ready
for
the
gathering
of
the
riders
a
little
beyond
they
met
two
men
from
the
company
on
their
way
to
the
meeting
place
soon
in
the
gray
early
morning
light
the
tracks
of
the
automobile
were
clearly
seen
eagerly
they
followed
to
the
foot
of
the
oak
knoll
trail
where
the
machine
had
stopped
and
turning
around
had
started
back
down
the
canyon
with
experienced
care
brian
oakley
searched
every
inch
of
the
ground
in
the
vicinity
shaking
his
head
at
last
as
though
forced
to
give
up
hope
of
finding
any
positive
signs
pointing
to
the
solution
of
the
puzzle
the
officer
remounted
slowly
i
ca
make
it
out
he
said
the
road
is
so
dry
and
cut
up
with
tracks
and
the
trail
is
so
gravelly
that
there
are
no
clear
signs
at
all
come
we
better
get
back
to
carleton
and
start
the
boys
out
when
milt
returns
from
fairlands
he
may
know
something
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
the
mountain
folk
summoned
in
the
night
by
the
ranger
messengers
assembled
at
the
ranch
every
man
armed
and
mounted
with
the
best
his
possessions
afforded
tied
to
the
trees
in
the
yard
and
along
the
fence
in
front
or
standing
with
over
their
heads
the
horses
waited
lying
on
the
porch
or
squatting
on
their
heels
in
unconscious
picturesque
attitudes
the
mountain
riders
who
had
arrived
first
and
had
finished
their
breakfast
were
ready
for
the
word
in
the
ranch
kitchen
the
table
was
filled
with
the
later
ones
and
these
as
fast
as
they
finished
their
meal
made
way
for
the
new
arrivals
there
was
no
loud
talk
no
boisterous
laughter
no
uneasy
restlessness
deliberate
in
movement
these
hardy
mountaineers
had
answered
brian
oakley
call
and
they
placed
themselves
now
under
his
command
with
no
idle
comment
no
wasteful
excitement
but
with
a
purpose
and
spirit
that
would
if
need
be
hold
them
in
their
saddles
until
their
horses
dropped
under
them
and
would
then
send
them
on
afoot
as
long
as
their
iron
nerves
and
muscles
could
be
made
to
respond
to
their
wills
there
was
scarce
a
man
in
that
company
who
did
not
know
and
love
sibyl
andr√©s
and
who
had
not
known
and
loved
her
parents
many
of
them
had
ridden
with
the
ranger
at
the
time
of
will
andr√©s
death
when
the
officer
and
his
companion
appeared
they
gathered
round
their
leader
with
simple
words
of
greeting
and
stood
silently
ready
for
his
word
briefly
brian
oakley
divided
them
into
parties
and
assigned
the
territory
to
be
covered
by
each
three
shots
in
quick
succession
at
intervals
of
two
minutes
would
signal
that
the
search
was
finished
two
men
he
held
to
go
with
him
up
oak
knoll
trail
after
his
messenger
to
the
sheriff
had
returned
at
sunset
they
were
all
to
reassemble
at
the
ranch
for
further
orders
when
the
officer
finished
speaking
the
little
group
of
men
turned
to
the
horses
and
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
were
out
of
sight
in
the
mountain
wilderness
a
half
hour
before
he
was
due
young
carleton
appeared
with
the
answer
to
the
ranger
letter
well
done
boy
said
brian
oakley
heartily
take
care
of
your
horse
now
and
then
get
some
rest
yourself
and
be
ready
for
whatever
comes
next
he
turned
to
those
he
had
held
to
go
with
him
all
right
boys
ride
sheriff
will
take
care
of
the
fairlands
end
come
aaron
all
the
way
up
the
oak
knoll
trail
the
ranger
rode
in
the
lead
bending
low
from
his
saddle
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
little
path
twice
he
dismounted
and
walked
ahead
leaving
the
chestnut
to
follow
or
to
wait
at
his
word
when
they
came
out
on
the
trail
he
halted
the
party
and
on
foot
went
carefully
over
the
ground
either
way
from
the
point
where
they
stood
boys
he
said
at
last
i
have
a
hunch
that
there
was
a
horse
on
this
trail
last
night
it
been
so
blamed
dry
and
for
so
long
though
that
i
ca
be
sure
i
held
you
two
men
because
i
know
you
are
good
trailers
follow
the
up
the
canyon
and
see
what
you
can
find
it
necessary
to
say
stay
with
it
if
you
strike
anything
that
even
looks
like
it
might
be
a
lead
aaron
and
i
will
take
the
other
way
and
up
the
galena
trail
to
the
while
brian
oakley
had
been
searching
for
signs
in
the
little
path
and
the
artist
with
the
others
was
waiting
aaron
king
mind
went
back
to
that
day
when
he
and
conrad
lagrange
had
sat
there
under
the
oaks
and
in
a
spirit
of
irresponsible
fun
had
committed
themselves
to
the
leadership
of
croesus
to
the
young
man
now
that
day
with
its
leisure
seemed
long
ago
remembering
the
novelist
fanciful
oration
to
the
burro
he
thought
grimly
how
unconscious
they
had
been
in
their
merriment
of
the
great
issues
that
did
actually
rest
upon
the
seemingly
trivial
incident
he
recalled
too
with
startling
vividness
the
times
that
he
had
climbed
to
that
spot
with
sibyl
or
reaching
it
from
either
way
on
the
had
gone
with
her
down
the
zigzag
path
to
the
road
in
the
canyon
below
had
she
last
night
alone
or
with
some
unwelcome
companions
paused
a
moment
under
those
oaks
had
she
remembered
the
hours
that
she
had
spent
there
with
him
as
he
followed
the
ranger
over
the
ground
that
he
had
walked
with
her
that
day
of
their
last
climb
together
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
step
of
the
way
was
haunted
by
her
sweet
personality
the
objects
along
the
trail
a
point
of
rock
a
pine
the
barrel
where
they
had
filled
their
canteen
a
broken
section
of
the
concrete
pipe
left
by
the
workmen
the
very
rocks
and
cliffs
the
flowers
dry
and
withered
now
that
grew
along
the
little
path
a
thousand
things
that
met
his
eyes
recalled
her
to
his
mind
until
he
felt
her
presence
so
vividly
that
he
almost
expected
to
find
her
waiting
with
smiling
winsome
face
just
around
the
next
turn
the
officer
who
moving
ahead
scanned
with
careful
eyes
every
foot
of
the
way
seemed
to
the
artist
now
to
be
playing
some
fantastic
game
he
could
not
for
the
moment
believe
that
the
girl
he
loved
was
god
where
was
she
why
did
brian
oakley
move
so
slowly
on
foot
while
his
horse
leisurely
cropping
the
grass
followed
he
should
be
in
the
saddle
they
should
be
riding
riding
riding
as
he
had
ridden
last
night
last
night
was
it
only
last
night
where
the
government
trail
crosses
the
on
the
crest
of
the
galenas
brian
oakley
paused
i
do
think
there
been
anything
over
this
way
he
said
we
follow
the
to
that
point
up
there
for
a
look
around
at
noon
they
stood
by
the
big
rock
under
the
clump
of
pines
where
aaron
king
and
sibyl
andr√©s
had
eaten
their
lunch
we
be
here
some
time
said
the
ranger
make
yourself
comfortable
i
want
to
see
if
there
anything
stirring
down
yonder
with
his
back
to
the
rock
he
searched
the
galena
valley
side
of
the
range
through
his
powerful
glass
commenting
now
and
then
when
some
object
came
in
the
field
of
his
vision
to
his
companion
who
sat
beside
him
they
had
risen
to
go
and
the
officer
was
returning
his
glass
to
its
case
on
his
saddle
when
aaron
king
pointing
toward
fairlands
lying
dim
and
hazy
in
the
distant
valley
said
look
there
the
other
turned
his
head
to
see
a
flash
of
light
that
winked
through
the
dull
smoky
veil
with
startling
clearness
he
smiled
and
turned
again
to
his
saddle
you
often
see
that
he
said
it
the
sun
striking
some
bright
object
that
happens
to
be
at
just
the
right
angle
to
hit
you
with
the
reflection
a
bit
of
new
tin
on
a
roof
a
window
an
automobile
shield
anything
bright
enough
will
do
the
trick
come
we
go
back
to
the
trail
and
follow
the
break
the
other
way
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
at
the
close
of
the
long
hard
day
as
brian
oakley
and
aaron
king
were
starting
down
the
oak
knoll
trail
on
their
return
to
the
ranch
the
ranger
uttered
an
exclamation
his
quick
eyes
had
caught
the
twinkling
gleam
of
a
light
at
sibyl
old
home
far
below
across
the
canyon
the
next
instant
the
chestnut
followed
by
his
companion
was
going
down
the
steep
trail
at
a
pace
that
sent
the
gravel
flying
and
forced
the
artist
unaccustomed
to
such
riding
to
cling
desperately
to
the
saddle
up
the
canyon
road
the
ranger
sent
the
chestnut
at
a
run
nor
did
he
draw
rein
as
they
crossed
the
rough
wash
plunging
through
the
tumbling
water
of
the
creek
the
horses
scrambled
up
the
farther
bank
and
dashed
along
the
old
road
into
the
little
clearing
they
were
met
by
czar
with
a
bark
of
welcome
a
moment
later
they
were
greeted
by
conrad
lagrange
and
myra
willard
but
why
do
you
stay
down
at
the
ranch
myra
asked
the
ranger
when
he
had
told
them
that
his
day
work
was
without
results
listen
oakley
returned
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
i
know
sibyl
too
well
not
to
understand
the
possibilities
of
her
temperament
natures
fine
and
sensitive
as
hers
though
brave
and
cool
and
strong
under
ordinary
circumstances
under
peculiar
mental
stress
such
as
i
believe
caused
her
to
leave
us
are
easily
thrown
out
of
balance
we
know
nothing
the
child
may
be
wandering
alone
dazed
and
helpless
under
the
shock
of
a
cruel
and
malicious
attempt
to
wreck
her
happiness
only
some
terrible
stress
of
emotion
could
have
caused
her
to
leave
me
as
she
did
if
she
alone
out
here
in
the
hills
there
is
a
chance
that
even
in
her
distracted
state
of
mind
she
will
find
her
way
to
her
old
home
the
woman
paused
and
then
in
the
silence
added
hesitatingly
i
i
may
say
that
i
know
from
experience
the
possibilities
of
which
i
speak
the
three
men
bowed
their
heads
brian
oakley
said
softly
myra
got
more
heart
and
more
sense
than
all
of
us
put
together
to
conrad
lagrange
he
added
you
will
stay
here
with
miss
willard
yes
answered
the
novelist
i
would
be
little
good
in
the
hills
at
such
work
as
you
are
doing
brian
i
will
do
what
i
can
here
when
the
ranger
and
the
artist
were
riding
down
the
canyon
to
the
ranch
the
officer
said
there
a
big
chance
that
myra
is
right
aaron
after
all
she
knows
sibyl
better
than
any
of
us
and
i
can
see
that
she
got
a
fairly
clear
idea
of
what
sent
the
child
off
like
this
as
it
stands
now
the
girl
may
be
just
wandering
around
if
she
the
boys
will
pick
her
up
before
many
hours
she
may
have
met
with
some
accident
if
it
we
know
before
long
she
may
have
been
i
tell
you
aaron
it
that
automobile
acting
the
way
it
did
that
i
ca
get
around
the
searchers
were
all
at
the
ranch
when
the
two
men
arrived
no
one
had
a
word
of
encouragement
to
report
a
messenger
from
the
sheriff
brought
no
light
on
the
mystery
of
the
automobile
the
two
men
who
had
followed
the
trail
had
found
nothing
a
few
times
they
thought
they
had
signs
that
a
horse
had
been
over
the
trail
the
night
before
but
there
was
no
certainty
and
after
the
reached
the
floor
of
the
canyon
there
was
absolutely
nothing
jack
carleton
was
back
from
the
galena
valley
neighborhood
and
with
him
was
the
horseman
who
had
gone
down
the
canyon
the
evening
before
the
man
was
known
to
all
he
had
been
hunting
and
was
on
his
way
home
when
henry
carleton
and
the
ranger
had
seen
him
he
had
come
now
to
help
in
the
search
picking
a
half
dozen
men
from
the
party
brian
oakley
sent
them
to
spend
the
night
riding
the
higher
trails
and
watching
for
lights
the
others
he
ordered
to
rest
in
readiness
to
take
up
the
search
at
daylight
should
the
night
riders
come
in
without
results
aaron
king
exhausted
physically
and
mentally
sank
into
a
stupor
that
could
scarcely
be
called
sleep
at
daybreak
the
riders
who
had
been
all
night
on
the
higher
trails
and
searching
the
darkness
for
the
possible
gleam
of
a
light
came
in
all
that
day
wednesday
the
mountain
horsemen
rode
widening
the
area
of
their
search
under
the
direction
of
the
ranger
from
sundown
until
long
after
dark
they
came
straggling
wearily
back
their
horses
nearly
exhausted
the
riders
beginning
to
fear
that
sibyl
would
never
be
found
alive
there
was
no
further
word
from
the
sheriff
at
fairlands
then
suddenly
out
of
the
blackness
of
the
night
a
rider
from
the
other
side
of
the
galenas
arrived
with
the
word
that
the
girl
horse
had
been
found
the
animal
was
grazing
in
the
neighborhood
of
pine
glen
the
saddle
and
the
horse
sides
were
stained
with
dirt
as
if
the
animal
had
fallen
the
had
been
broken
the
horse
might
have
rolled
on
the
saddle
he
might
have
stepped
on
the
he
might
have
fallen
and
left
his
rider
lying
senseless
in
any
case
they
reasoned
the
animal
would
scarcely
have
found
his
way
over
the
galena
range
after
he
had
been
left
to
wander
at
will
brian
oakley
decided
to
send
the
main
company
of
riders
over
into
the
pine
glen
country
to
continue
the
search
there
he
knew
that
the
men
who
found
the
horse
would
follow
the
animal
track
back
as
far
as
possible
he
knew
also
that
if
the
animal
had
been
wandering
several
hours
as
was
likely
it
would
be
impossible
to
far
late
as
it
was
aaron
king
rode
up
the
canyon
to
tell
myra
willard
and
conrad
lagrange
the
result
of
the
day
work
the
artist
voice
trembled
as
he
told
the
general
opinion
of
the
mountaineers
but
myra
willard
said
king
they
are
wrong
my
baby
will
come
back
there
harm
come
to
her
no
doubt
but
she
is
not
dead
or
i
would
know
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
aaron
king
reason
told
him
the
woman
of
the
disfigured
face
had
no
ground
for
her
belief
he
was
somehow
helped
by
her
words
to
hope
chapter
xxxiv
the
tracks
on
granite
peak
the
searching
party
was
already
on
the
way
over
to
pine
glen
when
brian
oakley
stopped
at
sibyl
old
home
for
aaron
king
the
ranger
himself
had
waited
to
receive
the
morning
message
from
the
sheriff
when
the
two
men
following
the
government
trail
that
leads
to
the
neighborhood
where
the
girl
horse
had
been
found
reached
the
on
the
summit
of
the
galenas
the
officer
said
aaron
you
be
of
little
use
over
there
in
that
pine
glen
country
where
you
have
never
been
he
had
pulled
up
his
horse
and
was
looking
at
his
companion
steadily
is
there
nothing
that
i
can
do
brian
returned
the
young
man
hopelessly
god
man
i
do
something
i
i
tell
you
steady
old
boy
steady
returned
the
mountaineer
calm
voice
the
first
thing
you
must
do
you
know
is
to
keep
a
firm
grip
on
yourself
if
you
lose
your
nerve
i
have
you
on
my
hands
too
under
his
companion
eye
the
artist
controlled
himself
you
right
brian
he
said
calmly
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
you
know
best
of
course
the
officer
still
watching
him
said
slowly
i
want
you
to
spend
the
day
on
that
point
up
there
he
pointed
to
the
clump
of
pines
with
this
glass
he
turned
to
take
an
extra
from
his
saddle
handing
the
glass
to
the
other
he
continued
you
can
see
all
over
the
country
on
the
galena
valley
side
of
this
range
from
there
again
he
paused
as
though
reluctant
to
give
the
final
word
of
his
instructions
the
young
man
looked
at
him
questioningly
yes
the
ranger
answered
in
a
low
tone
you
are
to
watch
for
buzzards
aaron
aaron
king
went
white
brian
you
think
the
answer
came
sharply
i
am
not
thinking
i
do
dare
think
i
am
only
recognizing
every
possibility
and
letting
nothing
get
away
from
me
i
do
want
to
think
i
want
you
to
do
the
thing
that
will
be
of
greatest
service
it
because
i
am
afraid
you
will
that
i
hesitate
to
assign
you
to
the
position
the
sharp
words
acted
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
in
the
young
man
face
unconsciously
he
straightened
in
his
saddle
thank
you
brian
i
understand
you
can
depend
upon
me
good
boy
came
the
hearty
and
instant
approval
if
you
see
anything
go
to
it
leaving
a
note
here
under
a
stone
on
top
of
this
rock
i
find
it
when
i
come
back
if
nothing
shows
up
stay
until
dark
and
then
go
down
to
carleton
i
be
in
late
the
rest
of
the
party
will
stay
over
at
pine
glen
alone
on
the
peak
where
he
had
sat
with
sibyl
the
day
of
their
last
climb
aaron
king
watched
for
the
buzzards
telltale
circling
flight
and
tried
not
to
think
it
was
one
when
the
artist
resting
his
eyes
for
a
moment
after
a
long
searching
look
through
the
glass
caught
again
that
flash
of
light
in
the
blue
haze
that
lay
over
fairlands
in
the
distant
valley
brian
oakley
had
said
when
they
had
seen
it
that
first
day
of
the
search
that
it
was
a
common
sight
but
the
artist
his
mind
preoccupied
watched
the
point
of
light
with
momentary
idle
interest
suddenly
he
awoke
to
the
fact
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
timed
regularity
in
the
flashes
into
his
mind
came
the
memory
of
something
he
had
read
of
the
heliograph
and
of
methods
of
signalling
with
mirrors
closely
now
he
watched
three
flashes
in
quick
succession
pause
two
flashes
pause
one
flash
pause
one
flash
pause
two
flashes
pause
three
flashes
pause
for
several
minutes
the
artist
waited
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
distant
spot
under
the
haze
then
the
flashes
began
again
repeating
the
same
order
at
the
last
flash
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
searched
the
mountain
peaks
and
spurs
behind
him
on
lonely
granite
peak
at
the
far
end
of
the
galena
range
a
flash
of
light
caught
his
eye
then
another
and
another
with
an
exclamation
he
lifted
his
glass
he
could
distinguish
nothing
but
the
peak
from
which
had
come
the
flashes
he
turned
toward
the
valley
to
see
a
long
flash
and
then
only
the
haze
and
the
dark
spot
that
he
knew
to
be
the
orange
groves
about
fairlands
aaron
king
sank
weak
and
trembling
against
the
rock
what
should
he
do
what
could
he
do
the
signals
might
mean
much
they
might
mean
nothing
brian
oakley
words
that
morning
came
to
him
i
am
recognizing
every
possibility
and
letting
nothing
get
away
from
me
instantly
he
was
galvanized
into
life
idle
thinking
wondering
conjecturing
could
accomplish
nothing
riding
as
fast
as
possible
down
to
the
boulder
beside
the
trail
where
he
was
to
leave
his
message
he
wrote
a
note
and
placed
it
under
the
rock
then
he
set
out
to
ride
the
along
the
top
of
the
range
toward
the
distant
granite
peak
an
hour
riding
took
him
to
the
end
of
the
and
he
saw
that
from
there
on
he
must
go
afoot
tying
the
over
the
and
fastening
a
note
to
the
saddle
in
case
any
one
should
find
the
horse
he
turned
the
animal
head
back
the
way
he
had
come
and
with
a
sharp
blow
started
it
forward
he
knew
that
the
horse
one
of
carleton
would
probably
make
its
way
home
turning
he
set
his
face
toward
the
lonely
peak
carrying
his
canteen
and
what
was
left
of
his
lunch
there
was
no
trail
for
his
feet
now
at
times
he
forced
his
way
through
and
over
bushes
of
buckthorn
and
manzanita
that
seemed
with
their
sharp
thorns
and
tangled
branches
to
be
stubbornly
fighting
him
back
at
times
he
made
his
way
along
some
steep
slope
from
pine
to
pine
where
the
ground
was
slippery
with
the
brown
needles
and
where
to
lose
his
footing
meant
a
fall
of
a
thousand
feet
again
he
scaled
some
rocky
cliff
clinging
with
his
fingers
to
jutting
points
of
rock
finding
niches
and
projections
for
his
feet
or
with
the
help
of
vine
and
root
and
bush
found
a
way
down
some
seemingly
impossible
precipice
now
and
then
from
some
higher
point
he
sighted
granite
peak
often
he
saw
far
below
on
one
hand
the
great
canyon
and
on
the
other
the
wide
galena
valley
always
he
pushed
forward
his
face
was
scratched
and
stained
his
clothing
was
torn
by
the
bushes
his
hands
were
bloody
from
the
sharp
rocks
his
body
reeked
with
sweat
his
breath
came
in
struggling
gasps
but
he
would
not
stop
he
felt
himself
driven
as
it
were
by
some
inner
power
that
made
him
insensible
to
hardship
or
death
far
behind
him
the
sun
dropped
below
the
of
the
distant
san
gabriels
but
he
did
not
notice
only
when
the
dusk
of
the
coming
night
was
upon
him
did
he
realize
that
the
day
was
gone
on
a
narrow
shelf
in
the
lee
of
a
great
cliff
he
hastily
gathered
material
for
a
fire
and
with
his
back
to
the
rock
ate
a
little
of
the
food
he
carried
far
up
on
that
mountain
ridge
the
night
was
bitter
cold
again
and
again
he
aroused
himself
from
the
weary
stupor
that
numbed
his
senses
and
replenished
the
fire
or
forced
himself
to
pace
to
and
fro
upon
the
ledge
overhead
he
saw
the
stars
glittering
with
a
strange
brilliancy
in
the
canyon
far
below
there
were
a
few
twinkling
lights
to
mark
the
carleton
ranch
and
the
old
home
of
sibyl
where
conrad
lagrange
and
myra
willard
waited
miles
away
the
lights
of
the
towns
among
the
orange
groves
twinkled
like
feeble
stars
in
another
feeble
world
the
cold
wind
moaned
and
wailed
in
the
dark
pines
and
swirled
about
the
cliff
in
sudden
gusts
a
cougar
screamed
somewhere
on
the
mountainside
below
an
answering
scream
came
from
the
ledge
above
his
head
the
artist
threw
more
fuel
upon
his
fire
and
grimly
walked
his
beat
in
the
cold
gray
dawn
of
that
friday
morning
he
ate
a
few
mouthfuls
of
his
scanty
store
of
food
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
even
while
the
canyon
below
was
still
in
the
gloom
started
on
his
way
it
was
eleven
when
almost
exhausted
he
reached
what
he
knew
must
be
the
peak
that
he
had
seen
through
his
glass
the
day
before
there
was
little
or
no
vegetation
upon
that
high
point
the
side
toward
the
distant
peak
from
which
the
artist
had
seen
the
signals
was
an
abrupt
cliff
hundreds
of
feet
of
sheer
granite
rock
from
the
rim
of
this
precipice
the
peak
sloped
gradually
down
and
back
to
the
edge
of
the
pines
that
grew
about
its
base
the
ground
in
the
open
space
was
bare
and
hard
carefully
aaron
king
searched
as
he
had
seen
the
ranger
do
for
signs
beginning
at
a
spot
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
he
worked
gradually
back
and
forth
in
ever
widening
arcs
toward
the
pines
below
he
was
almost
ready
to
give
up
in
despair
cursing
himself
for
being
such
a
fool
as
to
think
that
he
could
pick
up
a
trail
when
clearly
marked
in
a
bit
of
softer
soil
he
saw
the
print
of
a
boot
instantly
the
man
weariness
was
gone
the
long
hard
way
he
had
come
was
forgotten
insensible
now
to
hunger
and
fatigue
he
moved
eagerly
in
the
direction
the
pointed
he
was
rewarded
by
another
track
then
as
he
moved
nearer
the
softer
ground
toward
the
trees
another
and
another
and
then
the
man
worn
by
his
physical
exertion
and
by
his
days
of
mental
anguish
for
a
moment
lost
control
of
himself
clearly
marked
beside
the
broad
track
of
the
heavier
man
boot
was
the
unmistakable
print
of
a
smaller
lighter
foot
for
a
moment
he
stood
with
clenched
fists
and
heaving
breast
then
with
grim
eagerness
with
every
sense
supernaturally
alert
with
nerves
tense
quick
eyes
and
ready
muscles
he
went
forward
on
the
trail
it
was
after
dark
that
night
when
brian
oakley
on
his
way
back
to
clear
creek
stopped
at
the
rock
where
the
artist
had
left
his
note
reaching
the
floor
of
the
canyon
he
crossed
to
tell
myra
willard
and
the
novelist
the
result
of
the
day
search
the
men
riding
in
the
vicinity
of
pine
glen
had
found
nothing
it
had
been
as
the
ranger
expected
impossible
to
follow
back
for
any
distance
on
the
track
of
the
roaming
horse
for
the
animal
had
been
grazing
about
the
pine
glen
neighborhood
for
at
least
a
day
over
the
note
left
by
aaron
king
the
mountaineer
shook
his
head
doubtfully
aaron
had
done
right
to
go
but
for
one
of
his
inexperience
the
way
along
the
crest
of
the
galenas
was
practically
impossible
if
the
young
man
had
known
he
could
have
made
the
trip
much
easier
by
returning
to
clear
creek
and
following
up
to
the
head
of
that
canyon
then
climbing
to
the
crest
of
the
divide
and
so
around
to
granite
peak
the
ranger
himself
would
start
at
daybreak
for
the
peak
by
that
route
and
would
come
back
along
the
crest
of
the
range
to
find
the
artist
at
carleton
they
told
the
officer
that
aaron
horse
had
come
in
jack
carleton
and
his
father
arrived
from
the
country
above
lone
cabin
and
burnt
pine
a
few
minutes
after
brian
oakley
reached
the
ranch
it
was
agreed
that
henry
should
join
the
searchers
at
pine
glen
at
daybreak
lest
any
one
should
have
seen
the
artist
that
night
and
so
lose
precious
time
going
to
it
and
that
jack
should
accompany
the
ranger
to
granite
peak
henry
carleton
had
gone
on
his
way
to
pine
glen
and
brian
oakley
and
jack
were
in
the
saddle
ready
to
start
up
the
canyon
the
next
morning
when
a
messenger
from
the
sheriff
arrived
an
automobile
had
been
seen
returning
from
the
mountains
about
two
that
night
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
car
jack
said
the
ranger
aaron
has
got
hold
of
the
right
end
of
this
with
his
mirror
flashes
you
got
to
go
up
the
canyon
alone
get
to
granite
peak
as
quick
as
god
will
let
you
and
pick
up
the
trail
of
whoever
signalled
from
there
keeping
one
eye
open
for
aaron
i
going
to
trail
that
automobile
as
far
as
it
went
and
follow
whatever
met
or
left
it
we
likely
meet
somewhere
over
in
the
cold
water
country
a
minute
later
the
two
men
who
had
planned
to
ride
together
were
going
in
opposite
directions
following
the
fairlands
road
until
he
came
to
where
the
galena
valley
road
branches
off
from
the
clear
creek
way
three
miles
below
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
brian
oakley
found
the
tracks
of
an
automobile
made
without
doubt
during
the
night
just
past
the
machine
had
gone
up
the
galena
valley
road
and
had
returned
a
little
before
noon
the
officer
stood
where
the
automobile
had
stopped
and
turned
around
for
the
return
trip
the
place
was
well
up
toward
the
head
of
the
valley
near
the
mouth
of
a
canyon
that
leads
upward
toward
granite
peak
an
hour
careful
work
and
the
ranger
uncovered
a
small
store
of
supplies
hidden
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
canyon
there
were
tracks
leading
away
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
turning
his
horse
loose
to
find
its
way
home
brian
oakley
without
stopping
for
lunch
set
out
on
the
trail
high
up
on
granite
peak
aaron
king
was
bending
over
the
print
of
a
slender
shoe
beside
the
track
of
a
heavy
boot
somewhere
in
clear
creek
canyon
jack
carleton
was
riding
to
gain
the
point
where
the
artist
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
brian
oakley
was
setting
out
to
follow
the
faint
trail
that
started
at
the
supplies
brought
by
the
automobile
in
the
night
from
fairlands
chapter
xxxv
a
hard
way
when
sibyl
andr√©s
left
the
studio
after
meeting
taine
her
mind
was
dominated
by
one
thought
that
she
must
get
away
from
the
world
that
saw
only
evil
in
her
friendship
with
aaron
king
a
friendship
that
to
the
mountain
girl
was
as
pure
as
her
relations
to
myra
willard
or
brian
oakley
under
the
watchful
experienced
care
of
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
only
the
worthy
had
been
permitted
to
enter
into
the
life
of
this
child
of
the
hills
sibyl
character
mind
and
heart
and
body
and
soul
had
been
formed
by
the
strength
and
purity
of
her
mountain
environment
by
her
association
with
her
parents
with
myra
willard
and
with
her
parents
friends
and
by
her
mental
comradeship
with
the
greatest
spirits
that
music
and
literature
have
given
to
the
world
as
her
physical
strength
and
beauty
was
the
gift
of
her
free
mountain
life
the
beauty
and
strength
of
her
pure
spirit
was
the
gift
of
those
kindred
spirits
that
are
as
mountains
in
the
mental
and
spiritual
life
of
the
race
love
had
come
to
sibyl
andr√©s
not
as
it
comes
to
those
girls
who
in
the
of
passion
we
call
civilization
are
forced
into
premature
and
sickly
bloom
by
an
atmosphere
of
sensuality
love
had
come
to
her
so
gently
so
naturally
so
like
the
opening
of
a
wild
flower
that
she
had
not
yet
understood
that
it
was
love
even
as
her
womanhood
had
come
to
fulfill
her
girlhood
so
aaron
king
had
come
into
her
life
to
fulfill
her
womanhood
she
had
chosen
her
mate
with
an
unconscious
obedience
to
the
laws
of
life
that
was
divinely
reckless
of
the
world
myra
willard
wise
in
her
experience
and
in
her
more
than
mother
love
for
sibyl
saw
and
recognized
that
which
the
girl
herself
did
not
yet
understand
satisfied
as
to
the
character
of
aaron
king
as
it
had
been
tested
in
those
days
of
unhampered
companionship
and
seeing
as
well
his
growing
love
for
the
girl
the
woman
had
been
content
not
to
meddle
with
that
which
she
conceived
to
be
the
work
of
god
and
why
not
the
work
of
god
should
the
development
the
blossoming
and
the
fruiting
of
human
lives
that
the
race
may
flower
and
fruit
be
held
less
a
work
of
divinity
than
the
plants
that
mature
and
blossom
and
reproduce
themselves
in
their
children
the
character
of
taine
represented
those
forces
in
life
that
are
in
every
way
antagonistic
to
the
forces
that
make
the
character
of
a
sibyl
andr√©s
possible
in
a
spirit
of
wanton
selfish
cruelty
that
was
born
of
her
worldly
environment
and
training
the
age
had
twisted
and
distorted
the
very
virtues
of
nature
into
something
as
hideously
ugly
and
vile
as
her
own
thoughts
the
woman
product
of
gross
materialism
and
sensuality
had
caught
in
her
licentious
hands
god
human
flower
and
had
crushed
its
beauty
with
deliberate
purpose
wounded
frightened
dismayed
not
understanding
unable
to
deny
the
girl
turned
in
reluctant
flight
from
the
place
that
was
to
her
because
of
her
love
holy
ground
it
was
impossible
for
sibyl
not
to
believe
taine
the
woman
had
spoken
so
kindly
had
seemed
so
reluctant
to
speak
at
all
had
appeared
so
to
appreciate
her
innocence
a
thousand
trivial
and
unimportant
incidents
that
in
the
light
of
the
worldly
woman
words
could
be
twisted
to
evidence
the
truth
of
the
things
she
said
came
crowding
in
upon
the
girl
mind
instead
of
helping
aaron
king
with
his
work
instead
of
truly
enjoying
life
with
him
as
she
had
thought
her
friendship
was
to
him
a
menace
a
danger
she
had
believed
and
the
belief
had
brought
her
a
strange
happiness
that
he
had
cared
for
her
companionship
he
had
cared
only
to
use
her
for
his
pictures
as
he
used
his
brushes
he
had
played
with
her
as
she
had
seen
him
toy
idly
with
a
brush
while
thinking
over
his
work
he
would
throw
her
aside
when
she
had
served
his
purpose
as
she
had
seen
him
throw
a
brush
aside
the
woman
who
was
still
a
child
could
not
blame
the
artist
she
was
too
loyal
to
what
she
had
thought
was
their
friendship
she
was
too
unselfish
in
her
yet
unrecognized
love
for
her
chosen
mate
no
she
could
not
blame
him
only
only
she
wished
oh
how
she
wished
that
she
had
understood
it
would
not
have
hurt
so
perhaps
if
she
had
understood
in
all
the
cruel
tangle
of
her
emotions
in
all
her
confused
and
bewildering
thoughts
in
all
her
suffering
one
thing
was
clear
she
must
get
away
from
the
world
that
could
see
only
evil
she
must
go
at
once
conrad
lagrange
and
aaron
king
might
come
at
any
moment
she
could
not
face
them
now
that
she
knew
she
wished
myra
was
home
but
she
would
leave
a
little
note
and
myra
dear
myra
with
her
disfigured
face
would
understand
quickly
the
girl
wrote
her
letter
hurriedly
she
dressed
in
her
mountain
costume
still
acting
under
her
blind
impulse
to
escape
she
made
no
explanations
to
the
neighbors
when
she
went
for
the
horse
in
her
desire
to
avoid
coming
face
to
face
with
any
one
she
even
chose
the
more
unfrequented
streets
through
the
orange
groves
in
her
humiliation
and
shame
she
wished
for
the
kindly
darkness
of
the
night
not
until
she
had
left
the
city
far
behind
and
in
the
soft
dusk
drew
near
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
did
she
regain
some
measure
of
her
as
she
was
overtaking
the
power
company
team
and
wagon
of
supplies
she
turned
in
her
saddle
for
the
first
time
to
look
back
a
mile
away
on
the
road
she
could
see
a
cloud
of
dust
and
a
dark
moving
spot
which
she
knew
to
be
an
automobile
one
of
the
company
machines
she
thought
and
drew
a
breath
of
relief
that
fairlands
was
so
far
away
it
was
quite
dark
as
she
entered
the
canyon
but
as
she
drew
near
she
could
see
against
the
sky
those
great
gates
opening
silently
majestically
to
receive
her
from
within
the
canyon
she
watched
as
she
rode
to
see
them
slowly
close
again
the
sight
of
the
encircling
peaks
and
ridges
rising
in
solemn
grandeur
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
of
the
stars
comforted
her
the
night
wind
drawing
down
the
canyon
was
sweet
and
bracing
with
the
odor
of
the
hills
the
roar
of
the
tumbling
clear
creek
filling
the
night
with
its
music
soothed
and
calmed
her
troubled
mind
presently
she
would
be
with
her
friends
and
somehow
all
would
be
well
the
girl
had
ridden
half
the
distance
perhaps
from
the
canyon
gates
to
the
ranger
station
when
above
the
roar
of
the
mountain
stream
her
quick
ear
caught
the
sound
of
an
automobile
behind
her
looking
back
she
saw
the
gleam
of
the
lights
like
two
great
eyes
in
the
darkness
a
company
machine
going
up
to
the
she
thought
or
perhaps
the
doctor
to
see
some
one
of
the
mountain
folk
as
the
automobile
drew
nearer
she
reined
her
horse
out
of
the
road
and
halted
in
the
thick
chaparral
to
let
it
pass
the
blazing
lights
as
her
horse
turned
to
face
the
approaching
machine
blinded
her
the
animal
restive
under
the
ordeal
demanded
all
her
attention
she
scarcely
noticed
that
the
automobile
had
slowed
down
when
within
a
few
feet
of
her
until
a
man
suddenly
stood
at
her
horse
head
his
hand
on
the
as
though
to
assist
her
at
the
same
instant
the
machine
moved
past
them
and
stopped
its
engine
still
running
still
with
the
thought
of
the
company
men
in
her
mind
the
girl
saw
only
their
usual
courtesy
thank
you
she
said
i
can
handle
him
very
nicely
but
the
man
whom
she
had
not
had
time
to
see
blinded
as
she
had
been
by
the
light
and
who
was
now
only
dimly
visible
in
the
darkness
stepped
close
to
the
horse
shoulder
as
if
to
make
himself
more
easily
heard
above
the
noise
of
the
machine
his
hand
still
holding
the
it
is
miss
andr√©s
is
it
not
he
spoke
as
though
he
was
known
to
her
and
the
girl
still
thinking
that
it
was
one
of
the
company
men
and
feeling
that
he
expected
her
to
recognize
him
leaned
forward
to
see
his
face
as
she
answered
instantly
the
stranger
standing
close
and
taking
advantage
of
the
position
as
she
stooped
toward
him
from
the
saddle
caught
her
in
his
powerful
arms
and
lifted
her
to
the
ground
at
the
same
moment
the
companion
who
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
the
noise
of
the
machine
had
drawn
close
to
the
other
side
of
the
horse
caught
the
before
the
girl
taken
so
off
her
guard
could
cry
out
a
silk
handkerchief
was
thrust
between
her
lips
and
skillfully
tied
in
place
she
struggled
desperately
but
against
the
powerful
arms
of
her
captor
her
splendid
young
strength
was
useless
as
he
bound
her
hands
the
man
spoke
reassuringly
do
fight
miss
i
not
going
to
hurt
you
i
got
to
do
this
but
i
be
as
easy
as
i
can
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
wear
yourself
out
frightened
as
she
was
the
girl
felt
that
the
stranger
was
as
gentle
as
the
circumstances
permitted
him
to
be
he
had
not
in
fact
hurt
her
at
all
and
in
his
voice
she
caught
a
tone
of
genuine
regret
he
seemed
to
be
acting
wholly
against
his
will
as
if
driven
by
some
power
that
rendered
him
in
fact
as
helpless
as
his
victim
the
other
man
still
standing
by
the
horse
head
spoke
sharply
all
right
there
all
right
sir
gruffly
answered
the
man
who
held
sibyl
and
lifting
the
helpless
girl
gently
in
his
arms
he
seated
her
carefully
in
the
machine
an
was
thrown
around
her
the
high
collar
turned
up
to
hide
the
handkerchief
about
her
lips
and
her
hat
was
replaced
by
an
pulled
low
then
her
captor
went
back
to
the
horse
the
other
man
took
the
seat
beside
her
and
the
car
moved
forward
the
girl
fright
now
gave
way
to
perfect
coolness
realizing
the
uselessness
of
any
effort
to
escape
she
wisely
saved
her
strength
watchful
to
take
quick
advantage
of
any
opportunity
that
might
present
itself
silently
she
worked
at
her
bonds
and
endeavored
to
release
the
bandage
that
prevented
her
from
crying
out
but
the
hands
that
had
bound
her
had
been
too
skillful
turning
her
head
she
tried
to
see
her
companion
face
but
in
the
darkness
with
upturned
collar
and
cap
pulled
low
over
the
identity
of
the
man
driving
the
car
was
effectually
hidden
only
when
they
were
passing
the
ranger
station
and
sibyl
saw
the
lights
through
the
trees
did
she
for
a
moment
renew
her
struggle
with
all
her
strength
she
strained
to
release
her
hands
one
cry
from
her
strong
young
voice
would
bring
brian
oakley
so
quickly
after
the
automobile
that
her
safety
would
be
assured
on
that
mountain
road
the
chestnut
would
soon
run
them
down
she
even
tried
to
throw
herself
from
the
car
but
bound
as
she
was
the
hand
of
her
companion
easily
prevented
and
she
sank
back
in
the
seat
exhausted
by
her
useless
exertion
at
the
foot
of
the
oak
knoll
trail
the
automobile
stopped
the
man
who
had
been
following
on
sibyl
horse
came
up
quickly
swiftly
the
two
men
worked
placing
sacks
of
supplies
and
blankets
as
the
girl
guessed
on
the
animal
presently
the
one
who
had
bound
her
lifted
her
gently
from
the
automobile
do
hurt
yourself
miss
he
said
in
her
ear
as
he
carried
her
toward
the
horse
it
will
do
you
no
good
and
the
girl
did
not
again
resist
as
he
lifted
her
to
the
saddle
the
driver
of
the
car
said
something
to
his
companion
in
a
low
tone
and
sibyl
heard
her
captor
answer
the
girl
will
be
as
safe
with
me
as
if
she
were
in
her
own
home
again
the
other
spoke
and
the
girl
heard
only
the
reply
do
worry
i
understand
that
i
go
through
with
it
you
left
me
no
chance
to
do
anything
else
then
stepping
to
the
horse
head
and
taking
the
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
under
orders
led
the
way
up
the
canyon
behind
them
the
girl
heard
the
automobile
starting
on
its
return
the
sound
died
away
in
the
distance
the
silence
of
the
night
was
disturbed
only
by
the
sound
of
the
man
boots
and
the
horse
feet
on
the
road
once
her
captor
halted
a
moment
and
coming
to
the
horse
shoulder
asked
if
she
was
comfortable
the
girl
bowed
her
head
i
sorry
for
that
gag
he
said
as
soon
as
it
safe
i
remove
it
but
i
dare
not
take
chances
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
they
went
on
dimly
sibyl
saw
in
her
companion
manner
a
ray
of
hope
that
no
immediate
danger
threatened
she
was
assured
that
the
man
was
acting
against
his
will
was
as
evident
wisely
she
resolved
to
bend
her
efforts
toward
enlisting
his
sympathies
to
make
it
hard
for
him
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
whoever
controlled
him
instead
of
antagonizing
him
by
continued
resistance
and
repeated
attempts
to
escape
and
so
making
it
easier
for
him
to
do
his
master
bidding
leaving
the
canyon
by
the
laurel
creek
trail
they
reached
burnt
pine
where
the
man
removed
the
handkerchief
that
sealed
the
girl
lips
oh
thank
you
she
said
quietly
that
is
so
much
better
i
sorry
that
i
had
to
do
it
he
returned
as
he
unbound
her
arms
there
you
may
get
down
now
and
rest
while
i
fix
a
bit
of
lunch
for
you
the
girl
sprang
to
the
ground
it
is
a
relief
to
be
free
she
said
but
really
i
not
a
bit
tired
ca
i
help
you
with
the
pack
no
returned
the
other
gruffly
as
though
he
understood
her
purpose
and
put
himself
on
his
guard
we
only
be
here
a
few
minutes
and
it
a
long
road
ahead
you
must
rest
obediently
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
her
back
against
a
tree
as
they
lunched
in
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
she
said
may
i
ask
where
you
are
taking
me
it
a
long
road
miss
andr√©s
we
be
there
night
he
answered
reluctantly
again
she
ventured
timidly
and
is
is
some
one
waiting
for
for
us
at
the
end
of
our
journey
the
man
voice
was
kinder
as
he
answered
no
miss
andr√©s
there
he
just
you
and
me
for
some
time
and
he
added
you
do
need
to
fear
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
you
she
returned
gently
but
i
am
she
hesitated
i
am
sorry
for
you
that
you
have
to
do
this
the
man
arose
abruptly
we
must
he
going
for
some
distance
beyond
burnt
pine
they
kept
to
the
laurel
creek
trail
toward
san
gorgonio
then
they
turned
aside
to
follow
some
unmarked
way
known
only
to
the
man
when
the
first
soft
tints
of
the
day
shone
in
the
sky
behind
the
peaks
and
ridges
while
sibyl
friends
were
assembling
at
the
carleton
ranch
in
clear
creek
canyon
and
brian
oakley
was
directing
the
day
search
the
girl
was
following
her
guide
in
the
wild
depths
of
the
mountain
wilderness
miles
from
any
trail
the
country
was
strange
to
her
but
she
knew
that
they
were
making
their
way
far
above
the
canyon
rim
on
the
side
of
the
san
bernardino
range
toward
the
distant
cold
water
country
that
opened
into
the
great
desert
beyond
as
the
light
grew
stronger
sibyl
saw
her
companion
a
man
of
medium
height
with
powerful
shoulders
and
arms
dressed
in
khaki
with
mountain
boots
under
his
arm
as
he
led
the
way
with
a
powerful
stride
that
told
of
almost
tireless
strength
the
girl
saw
the
familiar
stock
of
a
winchester
rifle
presently
he
halted
and
as
he
turned
she
saw
his
face
it
was
not
a
bad
face
a
heavy
beard
hid
mouth
and
cheek
and
throat
but
the
nose
was
not
coarse
or
brutal
and
the
brow
was
broad
and
intelligent
in
the
brown
eyes
there
was
the
girl
thought
a
look
of
wistful
sadness
as
though
there
were
memories
that
could
not
be
escaped
we
will
have
breakfast
here
if
you
please
miss
andr√©s
he
said
gravely
i
so
hungry
she
answered
dismounting
may
i
make
the
coffee
he
shook
his
head
i
sorry
but
there
must
be
no
telltale
smoke
the
ranger
and
his
riders
are
out
by
now
as
like
as
not
you
seem
very
familiar
with
the
country
she
said
moving
easily
toward
the
rifle
which
he
had
leaned
against
a
tree
while
he
busied
himself
with
the
pack
of
supplies
i
am
he
answered
i
have
been
forced
to
learn
it
thoroughly
by
the
way
miss
andr√©s
he
added
without
turning
his
head
as
he
knelt
on
the
ground
to
take
food
from
the
pack
that
winchester
will
do
you
no
good
it
is
not
loaded
i
have
the
shells
in
my
belt
he
arose
facing
her
and
throwing
open
his
coat
touched
the
butt
of
a
colt
that
hung
in
a
shoulder
holster
under
his
left
armpit
this
will
serve
in
case
quick
action
is
needed
and
it
is
always
safely
out
of
your
reach
you
see
the
girl
laughed
i
admit
that
i
was
tempted
she
said
i
might
have
known
that
you
put
the
rifle
within
my
reach
to
try
me
i
thought
it
would
save
you
needless
disappointment
to
make
things
clear
at
once
he
answered
breakfast
is
ready
the
incident
threw
a
strong
light
upon
the
character
with
which
sibyl
had
to
deal
she
realized
more
than
ever
that
her
only
hope
lay
in
so
winning
this
man
sympathies
and
friendship
that
he
would
turn
against
whoever
had
forced
him
into
his
present
position
the
struggle
was
to
be
one
of
those
silent
battles
of
the
spirit
where
the
forces
that
war
are
not
seen
but
only
felt
and
where
those
who
fight
must
often
fight
with
smiling
faces
the
girl
part
was
to
enlist
her
captor
to
fight
for
her
against
himself
she
saw
as
clearly
the
need
of
approaching
her
object
with
caution
eager
to
know
who
it
was
that
ruled
this
man
and
by
what
peculiar
power
a
character
so
strong
could
be
so
subjected
she
dared
not
ask
hour
after
hour
as
they
journeyed
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
mountain
wilds
she
watched
and
waited
for
some
sign
that
her
mood
would
make
it
safe
for
her
to
approach
him
meanwhile
she
exercised
all
her
womanly
tact
to
lead
him
to
forget
his
distasteful
position
and
so
to
make
his
uncongenial
task
as
pleasant
as
possible
the
girl
did
not
realize
how
far
her
decision
in
itself
aroused
the
admiring
sympathy
of
her
captor
her
coolness
and
bravery
in
meeting
the
situation
with
calm
watchful
readiness
rather
than
with
hysterical
moaning
and
frantic
pleading
did
more
than
she
realized
toward
accomplishing
her
purpose
during
that
long
forenoon
she
sought
to
engage
her
guide
in
conversation
quite
as
though
they
were
making
a
pleasure
trip
that
was
mutually
agreeable
the
man
as
though
he
also
desired
his
thoughts
removed
as
far
as
might
be
from
his
real
mission
responded
readily
and
succeeded
in
making
himself
a
really
interesting
companion
only
once
did
the
girl
venture
to
approach
dangerous
ground
really
she
said
i
wish
i
knew
your
name
it
seems
so
stupid
not
to
know
how
to
address
you
is
that
asking
too
much
the
man
did
not
answer
for
some
time
and
the
girl
saw
his
face
clouded
with
somber
thought
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
gently
i
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
my
name
is
henry
marston
miss
andr√©s
he
said
deliberately
but
it
is
not
the
name
by
which
i
am
known
these
days
he
added
bitterly
it
is
an
honorable
name
and
i
would
like
to
hear
it
again
he
paused
from
you
sibyl
returned
gently
thank
you
marston
believe
me
i
do
appreciate
your
confidence
and
she
in
turn
hesitated
and
i
will
keep
the
trust
by
noon
they
had
reached
granite
peak
in
the
galenas
having
come
by
an
unmarked
way
through
the
wild
country
around
the
head
of
clear
creek
canyon
they
had
finished
lunch
when
marston
looking
at
his
watch
took
a
small
mirror
from
his
pocket
and
stood
gazing
expectantly
toward
the
distant
valley
where
fairlands
lay
under
the
blue
haze
presently
a
flash
of
light
appeared
then
another
and
another
it
was
the
signal
that
aaron
king
had
seen
and
to
which
he
had
called
brian
oakley
attention
that
first
day
of
their
search
with
his
mirror
the
man
on
granite
peak
answered
and
the
girl
watching
and
understanding
that
he
was
communicating
with
some
one
saw
his
face
grow
dark
with
anger
she
did
not
speak
they
had
traveled
a
half
mile
perhaps
from
the
peak
when
the
man
again
stopped
saying
you
must
dismount
here
please
removing
the
things
from
the
saddle
he
led
the
horse
a
little
way
down
the
galena
valley
side
of
the
ridge
and
tied
the
reins
to
a
tree
then
slapping
the
animal
about
the
head
with
his
open
hand
he
forced
the
horse
to
break
the
reins
and
started
him
off
toward
the
distant
valley
again
the
girl
understood
and
made
no
comment
lifting
the
pack
to
his
own
strong
shoulders
her
companion
his
eyes
avoiding
hers
in
shame
said
gruffly
come
their
way
now
led
down
from
the
higher
levels
of
peak
and
ridge
into
the
canyons
and
gorges
of
the
cold
water
country
there
was
no
trail
but
the
man
went
forward
as
one
entirely
at
home
at
the
head
of
a
deep
gorge
where
their
way
seemed
barred
by
the
face
of
an
impossible
cliff
that
towered
above
their
heads
a
thousand
feet
and
dropped
another
thousand
sheer
to
the
tops
of
the
pines
below
he
halted
and
faced
the
girl
enquiringly
you
have
a
good
head
miss
andr√©s
sibyl
smiled
i
was
born
in
the
mountains
marston
she
answered
you
need
not
fear
for
me
drawing
near
to
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
he
led
her
by
a
narrow
ledge
across
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
then
by
an
easier
path
down
the
opposite
wall
of
the
gorge
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
arrived
at
a
little
log
cabin
that
was
so
hidden
in
the
wild
tangle
of
mountain
growth
at
the
bottom
of
the
narrow
canyon
as
to
be
invisible
from
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
the
girl
knew
that
they
had
reached
the
end
of
their
journey
nearly
exhausted
by
the
hours
of
physical
exertion
and
worn
with
the
mental
and
nervous
strain
she
sank
down
upon
the
blankets
that
her
companion
spread
for
her
upon
the
ground
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
i
will
cook
a
hot
supper
for
you
he
said
regarding
her
kindly
poor
child
this
has
been
a
hard
hard
day
for
you
for
me
fighting
to
keep
back
the
tears
she
tried
to
thank
him
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
then
she
saw
his
face
grow
black
with
rage
and
clenching
his
great
fists
he
turned
away
while
waiting
for
the
darkness
that
would
hide
the
smoke
of
the
fire
the
man
gathered
cedar
boughs
from
trees
and
made
a
comfortable
bed
in
the
cabin
for
the
girl
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
he
built
a
fire
in
the
rude
and
in
a
few
minutes
announced
supper
the
meal
was
really
excellent
and
sibyl
in
spite
of
her
situation
ate
heartily
which
won
an
admiring
comment
from
her
captor
the
meal
finished
he
said
awkwardly
i
want
to
thank
you
miss
andr√©s
for
making
this
day
as
easy
for
me
as
you
have
we
will
be
alone
here
until
friday
at
least
perhaps
longer
there
is
a
bar
to
the
cabin
door
you
may
rest
here
as
safely
as
though
you
were
in
your
own
room
good
night
before
she
could
answer
he
was
gone
a
few
minutes
later
sibyl
stood
in
the
open
door
marston
she
called
yes
miss
andr√©s
came
instantly
out
of
the
darkness
please
come
into
the
cabin
there
was
no
answer
it
will
be
cold
out
there
please
come
inside
thank
you
miss
andr√©s
but
i
will
do
very
nicely
bar
the
door
and
go
to
sleep
but
marston
i
will
sleep
better
if
i
know
that
you
are
comfortable
the
man
came
to
her
and
she
saw
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
fire
standing
hat
in
hand
he
spoke
wonderingly
do
you
mean
miss
andr√©s
that
you
would
not
be
afraid
to
sleep
if
i
occupied
the
cabin
with
you
no
she
answered
i
am
not
afraid
come
in
but
he
did
not
move
to
cross
the
threshold
and
why
are
you
not
afraid
he
asked
curiously
because
she
answered
i
know
that
you
are
a
gentleman
the
man
laughed
harshly
such
a
laugh
as
sibyl
had
never
before
heard
a
gentleman
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
word
in
connection
with
myself
for
many
a
year
miss
andr√©s
you
have
little
reason
for
using
it
after
what
i
have
done
to
you
and
am
doing
oh
but
you
see
i
know
that
you
are
forced
to
do
what
you
are
doing
you
a
gentleman
mr
wo
you
please
come
in
and
sleep
by
the
fire
you
will
be
so
uncomfortable
out
there
and
you
have
had
such
a
hard
day
god
bless
you
for
your
good
heart
miss
andr√©s
the
man
said
brokenly
but
i
will
not
intrude
upon
your
privacy
do
you
see
he
added
savagely
do
you
see
that
i
i
bar
your
door
please
and
let
me
play
the
part
assigned
to
me
your
kindness
to
me
your
confidence
in
me
is
wasted
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
chapter
xxxvi
what
should
he
do
the
next
morning
it
was
evident
to
sibyl
andr√©s
that
the
man
who
said
his
name
was
henry
marston
had
not
slept
all
that
day
she
watched
the
battle
saw
him
fighting
with
himself
he
kept
apart
from
her
and
spoke
but
little
when
night
came
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
he
again
left
the
cabin
to
spend
the
long
dark
hours
in
a
struggle
that
the
girl
could
only
dimly
sense
she
could
not
understand
but
she
felt
him
fighting
fighting
and
she
knew
that
he
fought
for
her
what
was
it
what
terrible
unseen
force
mastered
this
man
compelled
him
to
do
its
bidding
even
while
he
hated
and
loathed
himself
for
submitting
watchful
ready
hoping
despairing
the
helpless
girl
could
only
pray
that
her
companion
might
be
given
strength
the
following
morning
at
breakfast
he
told
her
that
he
must
go
to
granite
peak
to
signal
his
orders
were
to
lock
her
in
the
cabin
and
to
go
alone
but
he
would
not
she
might
go
with
him
if
she
chose
even
this
crumb
of
encouragement
that
he
would
so
far
disobey
his
master
filled
the
girl
heart
with
hope
i
would
love
to
go
with
you
marston
she
said
but
if
it
is
going
to
make
trouble
for
you
i
would
rather
stay
you
mean
that
you
would
rather
be
locked
up
in
the
cabin
all
day
than
to
make
trouble
for
me
he
asked
it
would
be
so
terrible
she
answered
and
i
would
like
to
do
something
something
to
to
show
you
that
i
appreciate
your
kindness
to
me
there
nothing
else
i
do
is
there
the
man
looked
at
her
wonderingly
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
her
sincerity
and
sibyl
as
she
saw
his
face
knew
that
she
had
never
before
witnessed
such
mental
and
spiritual
anguish
the
eyes
that
looked
into
hers
so
questioningly
so
pleadingly
were
the
eyes
of
a
soul
in
torment
her
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
she
could
not
hide
and
she
turned
away
at
last
he
said
slowly
no
miss
andr√©s
you
shall
not
stay
in
the
cabin
come
we
must
go
on
or
i
shall
be
late
at
granite
peak
sibyl
watched
the
signal
flashes
from
distant
fairlands
the
flashes
that
aaron
king
was
watching
from
the
peak
where
they
had
sat
together
that
day
of
their
last
climb
as
the
man
answered
the
signals
with
his
mirror
and
the
girl
beside
him
watched
the
artist
was
training
his
glass
upon
the
spot
where
they
stood
but
partially
concealed
as
they
were
the
distance
was
too
great
when
sibyl
captor
turned
after
receiving
the
message
conveyed
by
the
flashes
of
light
his
face
was
terrible
to
see
and
the
girl
without
asking
knew
that
the
crisis
was
drawing
near
deadly
fear
gripped
her
heart
but
she
was
strangely
calm
on
the
way
back
to
the
cabin
the
man
scarcely
spoke
but
walked
with
bent
head
and
the
girl
felt
him
fighting
fighting
she
longed
to
cry
out
to
plead
with
him
to
demand
that
he
tell
her
why
he
must
do
this
thing
but
she
dared
not
she
knew
instinctively
that
he
must
fight
alone
so
she
watched
and
waited
and
prayed
as
they
were
crossing
the
face
of
the
canyon
wall
on
the
narrow
ledge
the
man
stopped
and
as
though
forgetting
the
girl
presence
stood
looking
moodily
down
into
the
depths
below
then
they
went
on
that
night
he
did
not
leave
the
cabin
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
their
evening
meal
but
sat
on
one
of
the
rude
seats
with
which
the
little
hut
was
furnished
gazing
into
the
fire
the
girl
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
said
miss
andr√©s
i
would
like
to
ask
your
opinion
in
a
matter
that
i
can
not
decide
satisfactorily
to
myself
she
took
the
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
rude
fireplace
what
is
it
mr
marston
i
will
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
story
he
answered
then
after
a
wait
of
some
minutes
as
though
he
found
it
hard
to
begin
he
said
it
is
an
old
story
miss
andr√©s
a
very
common
one
but
with
a
difference
a
young
man
with
every
chance
in
the
world
to
go
right
went
wrong
he
was
he
was
fairly
well
educated
his
father
was
a
man
of
influence
and
considerable
means
he
had
many
friends
good
and
bad
i
do
not
think
the
man
was
intentionally
bad
but
i
do
not
excuse
him
he
was
a
fool
all
a
fool
and
as
fools
must
he
paid
the
price
of
his
foolishness
a
sentence
of
thirty
years
in
the
penitentiary
is
a
big
price
for
a
young
man
to
pay
for
being
a
fool
miss
andr√©s
he
was
when
he
went
in
strong
and
vigorous
with
a
good
mind
the
prospects
years
of
prison
life
but
that
not
the
story
i
could
not
hope
to
make
you
understand
what
a
thirty
years
sentence
to
the
penitentiary
means
to
a
man
of
but
at
least
you
will
not
wonder
that
the
man
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
he
prayed
for
an
opportunity
for
ten
years
ten
years
miss
andr√©s
the
man
watched
and
prayed
for
a
chance
to
escape
then
he
got
away
he
was
never
a
criminal
at
heart
you
must
understand
he
had
no
wish
now
to
live
a
life
of
crime
he
wished
only
to
live
a
sane
orderly
useful
life
of
freedom
they
hunted
him
to
the
mountains
they
could
not
take
him
but
they
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
escape
he
was
starving
dying
he
would
not
give
himself
up
to
the
twenty
years
of
hell
that
waited
him
he
did
not
want
to
die
but
he
would
die
rather
than
go
back
then
one
day
when
he
was
very
near
the
end
a
man
found
him
the
poor
hunted
devil
of
a
convict
aroused
his
pity
he
offered
help
he
gave
the
wretched
starving
creature
food
he
arranged
to
furnish
him
with
supplies
until
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
leave
his
hiding
place
he
brought
him
food
and
clothing
and
books
later
when
the
convict
prison
pallor
was
gone
when
his
hair
and
beard
were
grown
and
the
prison
manner
and
walk
were
in
some
measure
forgotten
when
the
officers
thinking
that
he
had
perished
in
the
mountains
had
given
up
looking
for
him
his
benefactor
gave
him
work
beautiful
work
in
the
orange
groves
where
he
was
safe
and
happy
and
useful
and
could
feel
himself
a
do
you
wonder
miss
andr√©s
that
the
man
was
grateful
do
you
wonder
that
he
worshipped
his
benefactor
that
he
looked
upon
his
friend
as
upon
his
savior
no
said
the
girl
i
do
not
wonder
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
to
do
to
help
the
poor
fellow
who
wanted
to
do
right
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
man
who
had
escaped
loved
his
friend
but
listen
said
the
other
when
the
convict
was
beginning
to
feel
safe
when
he
saw
that
he
was
out
of
danger
when
he
was
living
an
honorable
happy
life
instead
of
spending
his
days
in
the
hell
they
call
prison
when
he
was
looking
forward
to
years
of
happiness
instead
of
to
years
of
torment
then
his
benefactor
came
to
him
suddenly
one
day
and
said
you
do
what
i
tell
you
now
unless
you
help
me
to
something
that
i
want
i
will
send
you
back
to
prison
do
as
i
say
and
your
life
shall
go
on
as
it
is
as
you
have
planned
refuse
and
i
will
turn
you
over
to
the
officers
and
you
will
go
back
to
your
hell
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
do
you
wonder
miss
andr√©s
that
the
convict
obeyed
his
master
the
girl
face
was
white
with
despair
but
she
did
not
lose
her
she
answered
the
man
thoughtfully
as
though
they
were
discussing
some
situation
in
which
neither
had
a
vital
interest
i
think
marston
she
said
that
it
would
depend
upon
what
it
was
that
the
man
wanted
the
convict
to
do
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
imagine
the
convict
being
happier
in
prison
knowing
that
he
had
not
done
what
the
man
wanted
than
he
would
he
free
remembering
what
he
had
done
to
gain
his
freedom
what
was
it
the
man
wanted
breathlessly
sibyl
waited
the
answer
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
did
not
speak
at
last
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
henry
marston
said
freedom
and
a
life
of
honorable
usefulness
purchased
at
a
price
or
hell
with
only
the
memory
of
a
good
deed
which
should
the
man
choose
miss
andr√©s
i
think
she
replied
that
you
should
tell
me
plainly
what
it
was
that
the
man
wanted
the
convict
to
do
i
will
go
on
with
the
story
said
the
other
the
convict
benefactor
or
perhaps
i
should
say
master
loved
a
woman
who
refused
to
listen
to
him
the
girl
for
some
reason
left
home
very
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
to
any
one
she
left
a
hurried
note
saying
only
that
she
was
going
away
by
accident
the
man
found
the
note
and
saw
his
opportunity
he
guessed
that
the
girl
would
go
to
friends
in
the
mountains
he
saw
that
if
he
could
intercept
her
and
keep
her
hidden
no
one
would
know
what
had
become
of
her
he
believed
that
she
would
marry
him
rather
than
face
the
world
after
spending
so
many
days
with
him
alone
because
her
manner
of
leaving
home
would
lend
color
to
the
story
that
she
had
gone
with
him
their
marriage
would
save
her
good
name
he
wanted
the
man
whom
he
could
send
back
to
prison
to
help
him
the
convict
had
known
his
benefactor
kindness
of
heart
you
must
remember
miss
andr√©s
he
knew
that
this
man
was
able
to
give
his
wife
everything
that
seems
desirable
in
life
that
thousands
of
women
would
have
been
glad
to
marry
him
the
man
assured
the
convict
that
he
desired
only
to
make
the
girl
his
wife
before
all
the
world
he
agreed
that
she
should
remain
under
the
convict
protection
until
she
his
wife
and
that
the
convict
should
himself
witness
the
ceremony
the
man
paused
when
the
girl
did
not
speak
he
said
again
do
you
wonder
miss
andr√©s
that
the
convict
obeyed
his
master
no
said
the
girl
softly
i
do
not
wonder
but
marston
she
continued
hesitatingly
what
do
you
think
the
convict
in
your
story
would
have
done
if
the
man
had
not
if
he
had
not
wanted
to
marry
the
girl
i
know
what
he
would
have
done
in
that
case
the
other
answered
with
conviction
he
would
have
gone
back
to
his
twenty
years
of
hell
he
would
have
gone
back
to
fifty
years
of
hell
if
need
be
rather
than
buy
his
freedom
at
such
a
price
the
girl
leaned
forward
eagerly
and
suppose
suppose
that
after
the
convict
had
done
his
master
bidding
suppose
that
after
he
had
taken
the
girl
away
from
her
friends
suppose
then
the
man
would
not
marry
her
for
a
moment
there
was
no
sound
in
the
little
room
save
the
crackling
of
the
fire
in
the
and
the
sound
of
a
stick
that
had
burned
in
two
falling
in
the
ashes
what
would
the
convict
do
if
the
man
would
not
marry
the
girl
persisted
sibyl
her
companion
spoke
with
the
solemnity
of
a
judge
passing
sentence
if
the
man
violated
his
word
if
he
lied
to
the
convict
if
his
purpose
toward
the
girl
was
anything
less
than
an
honorable
marriage
if
he
refused
to
keep
his
promise
after
the
convict
had
done
his
part
he
would
die
miss
andr√©s
the
convict
would
kill
his
benefactor
as
surely
as
there
is
a
just
god
who
alone
can
say
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
the
girl
uttered
a
low
cry
the
man
did
not
seem
to
notice
but
the
man
will
do
as
he
promised
miss
andr√©s
he
wishes
to
make
the
girl
his
wife
he
can
give
her
all
that
women
these
days
seem
to
desire
in
marriage
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
would
be
envied
by
thousands
and
the
convict
would
gain
freedom
and
the
right
to
live
an
honorable
life
the
right
to
earn
his
bread
by
doing
an
honest
man
work
freedom
and
a
life
of
honorable
service
at
the
price
or
hell
with
only
the
memory
of
a
good
deed
which
should
he
choose
miss
andr√©s
the
convict
is
past
deciding
for
himself
the
troubled
answer
came
out
of
the
honesty
of
the
girl
heart
marston
i
do
not
know
a
moment
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
waited
then
rising
he
quietly
left
the
cabin
the
girl
did
not
know
that
he
was
gone
until
she
heard
the
door
close
in
that
log
hut
hidden
in
the
deep
gorge
in
the
wild
cold
water
country
sibyl
andr√©s
sat
before
the
dying
fire
waiting
for
the
dawn
on
a
high
ledge
in
the
galena
mountains
aaron
king
grimly
walked
his
weary
beat
in
clear
creek
canyon
myra
willard
and
conrad
lagrange
waited
and
brian
oakley
planned
for
the
morrow
over
in
the
galena
valley
an
automobile
from
fairlands
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
a
canyon
leading
toward
granite
peak
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
man
strove
to
know
right
from
wrong
chapter
xxxvii
the
man
was
insane
neither
sibyl
andr√©s
nor
her
companion
the
next
morning
reopened
their
conversation
of
the
night
before
each
was
preoccupied
and
silent
with
troubled
thoughts
that
might
not
be
spoken
often
as
the
forenoon
passed
sibyl
saw
the
man
listening
as
though
for
a
step
on
the
mountainside
above
she
knew
without
being
told
that
the
convict
was
expecting
his
master
it
was
perhaps
ten
when
they
heard
a
sound
that
told
them
some
one
was
approaching
the
man
caught
up
his
rifle
and
slipped
a
round
of
cartridges
into
the
magazine
saying
to
the
girl
go
into
the
cabin
and
bar
the
door
quick
do
as
i
say
do
come
out
until
i
call
you
she
obeyed
and
the
convict
himself
rifle
in
hand
disappeared
in
the
heavy
underbrush
a
few
minutes
later
james
rutlidge
parted
the
bushes
and
stepped
into
the
little
open
space
in
front
of
the
cabin
the
convict
reappeared
his
rifle
under
his
arm
the
greeted
the
man
whom
sibyl
knew
as
henry
marston
with
hello
george
everything
all
right
where
is
she
miss
andr√©s
is
in
the
cabin
when
i
heard
you
coming
i
asked
her
to
go
inside
and
took
cover
in
the
brush
myself
until
i
knew
for
sure
that
it
was
you
rutlidge
laughed
you
are
all
right
george
but
you
need
worry
everything
is
as
peaceful
as
a
graveyard
they
found
the
horse
and
they
think
now
that
the
girl
killed
herself
or
met
with
an
accident
while
wandering
around
the
hills
in
a
state
of
mental
aberration
you
left
the
supplies
at
the
same
old
place
i
suppose
said
the
convict
yes
i
brought
what
i
could
rutlidge
indicated
a
pack
which
he
had
slipped
from
his
shoulder
as
he
was
talking
you
better
hike
over
there
and
bring
in
the
rest
if
you
leave
at
once
you
will
make
it
back
by
noon
the
girl
in
the
cabin
listening
heard
every
word
and
trembled
with
fear
the
convict
spoke
again
what
are
your
plans
mr
rutlidge
never
mind
my
plans
now
they
can
wait
until
you
get
back
you
must
start
at
once
you
say
miss
andr√©s
is
in
the
cabin
he
turned
toward
the
door
but
the
other
said
shortly
wait
a
minute
sir
i
have
a
word
to
say
before
i
go
well
out
with
it
you
are
not
going
to
forget
your
promise
to
me
certainly
not
george
you
are
safe
i
mean
regarding
miss
andr√©s
oh
of
course
not
why
what
the
matter
nothing
only
she
is
in
my
care
until
she
is
your
wife
james
rutlidge
laughed
i
will
take
good
care
of
her
until
you
get
back
you
need
have
no
fear
you
not
doubting
my
word
are
you
if
i
doubted
your
word
i
would
take
miss
andr√©s
with
me
answered
the
convict
simply
james
rutlidge
looked
at
him
curiously
oh
you
would
yes
sir
i
would
and
i
think
i
should
tell
you
too
that
if
you
forget
your
promise
well
what
would
you
do
if
i
should
forget
the
answer
came
deliberately
if
you
do
not
keep
your
promise
i
will
kill
you
mr
rutlidge
james
rutlidge
did
not
reply
stepping
to
the
cabin
door
the
convict
knocked
sibyl
voice
answered
yes
you
may
come
out
now
please
miss
andr√©s
as
the
girl
opened
the
door
she
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
tone
thank
you
marston
i
heard
i
meant
you
to
hear
he
returned
in
a
whisper
do
not
be
afraid
in
a
louder
tone
he
continued
i
must
go
for
supplies
miss
andr√©s
i
will
be
back
noon
he
stepped
around
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
was
gone
sibyl
andr√©s
faced
james
rutlidge
without
speaking
she
was
not
afraid
now
as
she
had
always
been
in
his
presence
until
that
day
when
he
had
so
plainly
declared
himself
to
her
and
she
met
his
advances
with
a
gun
the
convict
warning
to
the
man
who
could
send
him
back
to
prison
for
practically
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
had
served
its
purpose
in
giving
her
courage
she
did
not
believe
that
for
the
present
rutlidge
would
dare
to
do
otherwise
than
heed
the
warning
illustration
still
she
did
not
speak
james
rutlidge
regarded
her
with
a
smile
of
triumphant
satisfaction
really
he
said
at
last
you
do
not
seem
at
all
glad
to
see
me
she
made
no
reply
i
am
frightfully
hungry
he
continued
with
a
short
laugh
moving
toward
her
as
she
stood
in
the
door
of
the
cabin
i
been
walking
since
midnight
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
here
that
i
did
even
stop
for
breakfast
she
stepped
out
and
moved
away
from
the
door
with
another
laugh
he
entered
the
cabin
presently
when
he
had
helped
himself
to
food
he
went
back
to
the
girl
who
had
seated
herself
on
a
log
at
the
farther
side
of
the
little
clearing
you
seem
fairly
comfortable
here
he
said
she
did
not
speak
you
and
my
man
get
along
nicely
i
take
it
he
has
been
kind
to
you
still
she
did
not
speak
he
spoke
sharply
look
here
my
girl
you
ca
keep
this
up
you
know
say
what
you
have
to
say
and
let
get
it
over
all
the
time
she
had
been
regarding
him
intently
her
wide
blue
eyes
filled
with
wondering
pain
how
could
you
she
said
at
last
oh
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
his
face
flushed
i
did
it
because
you
have
driven
me
mad
i
guess
from
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
have
wanted
you
i
have
tried
again
and
again
in
the
last
three
years
to
approach
you
but
you
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
the
more
you
spurned
me
the
more
i
wanted
you
then
this
man
king
came
you
were
friendly
enough
with
him
it
made
me
wild
from
that
day
when
i
met
you
in
the
mountains
above
lone
cabin
i
have
been
ready
for
anything
i
determined
if
i
could
not
win
you
by
fair
means
i
would
take
you
in
any
way
i
could
when
my
opportunity
came
i
took
advantage
of
it
i
got
you
the
story
is
already
started
that
you
were
the
painter
mistress
and
that
you
have
committed
suicide
you
shall
stay
here
a
while
until
the
belief
that
you
are
dead
has
become
a
certainty
then
you
will
go
east
with
me
but
you
can
not
do
a
thing
so
horrible
she
exclaimed
i
would
tell
my
story
to
the
first
people
we
met
he
laughed
grimly
as
he
retorted
with
brutal
meaning
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
you
will
be
glad
enough
to
keep
the
story
a
secret
when
the
time
comes
to
go
bewildered
by
fear
and
shame
the
girl
could
only
stammer
how
could
you
oh
how
could
you
why
why
why
he
echoed
then
as
he
went
a
step
toward
her
he
exclaimed
with
reckless
profanity
ask
the
god
who
made
me
what
i
am
why
i
want
you
ask
the
god
who
made
you
so
beautiful
why
he
moved
another
step
toward
her
his
face
flushed
with
the
insane
passion
that
mastered
him
his
eyes
burning
with
the
reckless
light
of
one
past
counting
the
cost
and
the
girl
seeing
sprang
to
her
feet
in
terror
wheeling
suddenly
she
ran
into
the
cabin
thinking
to
shut
and
bar
the
door
she
reached
the
door
and
swung
it
shut
but
the
bar
was
gone
while
he
was
in
the
cabin
he
had
placed
it
out
of
her
reach
putting
his
shoulder
to
the
door
the
man
easily
forced
it
open
against
her
lighter
weight
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
she
sprang
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
little
room
and
cowered
trembling
too
shaken
with
horror
to
cry
out
a
moment
he
paused
then
started
toward
her
at
that
instant
the
convict
burst
through
the
underbrush
into
the
little
opening
hearing
the
sound
rutlidge
wheeled
and
sprang
to
the
open
door
the
convict
was
breathing
heavily
from
the
exertion
of
a
hard
run
what
are
you
doing
here
demanded
rutlidge
sharply
what
the
matter
some
one
is
following
my
trail
down
from
granite
peak
well
what
are
you
carrying
that
rifle
for
said
rutlidge
harshly
with
an
oath
there
may
be
others
near
enough
to
hear
a
shot
answered
the
convict
besides
rutlidge
this
is
your
part
of
the
game
not
mine
i
did
not
agree
to
commit
murder
for
you
where
did
you
see
him
a
half
mile
beyond
the
head
of
the
gulch
where
we
turn
off
to
go
to
the
supply
point
rutlidge
rifle
in
hand
stepped
from
the
house
you
stay
here
and
take
care
of
the
girl
and
see
that
she
does
scream
with
the
last
word
he
set
out
at
a
run
the
convict
sprang
into
the
cabin
where
sibyl
still
crouched
in
the
corner
the
man
voice
was
imploring
as
he
said
miss
andr√©s
miss
andr√©s
what
is
the
matter
did
he
touch
you
tell
me
did
he
harm
you
sobbing
the
girl
held
out
her
hands
and
he
lifted
her
to
her
feet
you
you
came
just
in
time
mr
marston
an
instant
he
stood
there
then
muttering
something
under
his
breath
he
turned
caught
up
his
rifle
and
started
toward
the
door
but
as
he
reached
the
threshold
she
cried
out
marston
do
do
leave
me
again
the
convict
stopped
hesitated
then
he
said
solemnly
miss
andr√©s
can
you
pray
i
know
you
can
you
are
a
good
girl
if
god
can
hear
a
prayer
he
will
surely
hear
you
come
with
me
come
and
pray
girl
pray
for
me
the
most
charitable
construction
that
can
be
put
upon
the
action
of
james
rutlidge
just
related
is
to
accept
the
explanation
of
his
conduct
that
he
himself
made
to
sibyl
the
man
was
insane
as
taine
was
insane
as
taine
was
insane
what
else
can
be
said
of
a
class
of
people
who
in
an
age
wedded
to
materialism
demand
of
their
artists
not
that
they
shall
set
before
them
ideals
of
truth
and
purity
and
beauty
but
that
they
shall
feed
their
diseased
minds
with
thoughts
of
lust
and
stimulate
their
abnormal
passions
with
lascivious
imaginings
can
a
class
whatever
its
pretense
to
culture
may
be
can
a
class
that
in
story
and
picture
and
music
and
play
counts
greatest
in
art
those
who
most
effectively
arouse
the
basest
passions
of
which
the
human
being
is
capable
be
rightly
judged
sane
james
rutlidge
was
bred
born
and
reared
in
an
atmosphere
that
does
not
tolerate
purity
of
thought
it
was
literally
impossible
for
him
to
think
sanely
of
the
holiest
most
sacred
most
fundamental
facts
of
life
education
culture
art
literature
all
that
is
commonly
supposed
to
lift
man
above
the
level
of
the
beasts
are
used
by
men
and
women
of
his
kind
to
so
pervert
their
own
natures
that
they
are
able
to
descend
to
bestial
depths
that
the
dumb
animals
themselves
are
not
capable
of
reaching
in
what
he
called
his
love
for
sibyl
andr√©s
james
rutlidge
was
insane
but
no
more
so
than
thousands
of
others
the
methods
of
securing
the
objects
of
their
desires
vary
the
motive
that
prompts
is
the
same
the
end
sought
is
identical
as
he
hurriedly
climbed
the
mountainside
out
of
the
deep
gorge
that
hid
the
cabin
the
man
mind
was
in
a
whirl
of
emotions
rage
at
being
interrupted
at
the
moment
of
his
triumph
dread
lest
the
approaching
one
should
be
accompanied
by
others
and
the
girl
be
taken
from
him
fear
that
the
convict
would
prove
troublesome
even
should
the
more
immediate
danger
be
averted
anger
at
himself
for
being
so
blindly
precipitous
and
a
maddening
indecision
as
to
how
he
should
check
the
man
who
was
following
the
tracks
that
led
from
granite
peak
to
the
evident
object
of
his
search
the
words
of
the
convict
rang
in
his
ears
this
is
your
job
i
did
not
agree
to
commit
murder
for
you
murder
had
no
place
in
the
insanity
of
james
rutlidge
to
destroy
innocence
to
kill
virtue
to
murder
a
soul
these
are
commonplaces
in
the
insane
philosophy
of
his
kind
but
to
kill
to
take
a
life
deliberately
the
thought
was
abhorrent
to
him
he
was
not
educated
to
the
thought
of
life
he
was
trained
to
consider
its
the
heroes
in
fiction
did
not
men
they
women
the
heroines
in
his
stories
did
not
desire
the
death
of
their
betrayers
they
loved
them
and
deserted
their
husbands
for
them
but
to
stand
idly
aside
and
permit
sibyl
andr√©s
to
be
taken
from
him
to
face
the
exposure
that
would
inevitably
follow
was
impossible
if
the
man
who
had
struck
the
trail
was
alone
there
might
still
be
a
chance
if
he
could
be
stopped
but
how
could
he
check
him
what
could
he
do
a
might
bring
a
dozen
searchers
while
these
thoughts
were
seething
in
his
hot
brain
he
was
climbing
rapidly
toward
the
cliff
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
across
which
he
knew
the
man
who
was
following
the
tracks
that
led
to
the
cabin
below
must
come
gaining
the
end
of
the
ledge
that
leads
across
the
face
of
that
mighty
wall
of
rock
less
than
a
hundred
feet
to
the
other
side
he
stopped
there
was
no
one
in
sight
looking
down
he
saw
a
thousand
feet
below
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
lifting
his
head
he
looked
carefully
about
searching
the
mountainsides
that
slope
steeply
back
from
the
rim
of
the
narrow
canyon
he
looked
up
at
the
frowning
cliff
that
towered
a
thousand
feet
above
his
head
he
listened
he
was
thinking
thinking
the
best
of
him
and
the
worst
of
him
struggled
for
supremacy
a
sound
on
the
mountainside
above
the
gorge
and
beyond
the
other
end
of
the
ledge
caught
his
ear
with
a
quick
step
he
moved
behind
a
projecting
corner
of
the
cliff
rifle
in
hand
he
waited
chapter
xxxviii
an
inevitable
conflict
when
aaron
king
set
out
to
follow
the
tracks
he
had
found
at
granite
peak
after
his
long
hard
trip
along
the
rugged
crest
of
the
galenas
his
weariness
was
forgotten
eagerly
as
if
fresh
and
strong
but
with
careful
eyes
and
every
sense
keenly
alert
he
went
forward
on
the
trail
that
he
knew
must
lead
him
to
sibyl
andr√©s
he
did
not
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
how
the
girl
came
there
nor
did
he
pause
to
wonder
about
her
companion
he
did
not
even
ask
himself
if
sibyl
were
living
or
dead
he
thought
of
nothing
knew
nothing
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
trail
that
led
away
into
the
depths
of
the
mountain
wilderness
insensible
to
his
own
physical
condition
without
food
unacquainted
with
the
wild
country
into
which
he
was
going
reckless
of
danger
to
himself
but
with
all
possible
care
and
caution
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
he
loved
he
went
on
coming
to
the
brink
of
the
gorge
in
which
the
cabin
was
hidden
the
trail
following
the
rim
soon
led
him
to
the
ledge
that
lay
across
the
face
of
the
cliff
at
the
head
of
the
narrow
canyon
a
moment
he
paused
to
search
the
vicinity
with
careful
eyes
then
started
to
cross
as
he
set
foot
upon
the
ledge
a
voice
at
the
other
end
called
sharply
stop
at
the
word
aaron
king
halted
a
moment
passed
james
rutlidge
stepped
from
behind
the
rocks
at
the
other
end
of
the
ledge
he
was
covering
the
artist
with
a
rifle
in
a
flash
the
man
on
the
trail
understood
the
automobile
the
mirror
signals
from
fairlands
it
was
all
explained
by
the
presence
and
by
the
menacing
attitude
of
the
man
who
barred
his
way
the
artist
hand
moved
toward
the
weapon
that
hung
at
his
hip
do
do
that
said
the
man
with
the
rifle
i
ca
murder
you
in
cold
blood
but
if
you
attempt
to
draw
your
gun
i
fire
the
other
stood
still
james
rutlidge
spoke
again
his
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
listen
to
me
king
it
useless
for
me
to
deny
what
brought
me
here
the
trail
you
are
following
leads
to
sibyl
andr√©s
you
had
her
all
summer
i
got
her
now
if
you
had
stumbled
onto
the
trail
up
there
i
would
have
taken
her
out
of
the
country
and
you
would
never
have
seen
her
again
i
might
have
killed
you
before
you
saw
me
but
i
could
i
not
that
kind
under
the
circumstances
there
is
no
possible
compromise
i
give
you
a
fighting
chance
for
your
life
and
the
girl
i
take
a
fighting
chance
for
my
life
and
the
girl
throw
your
gun
out
of
reach
and
i
leave
mine
here
meet
on
the
ledge
there
james
rutlidge
was
no
coward
taine
also
it
will
be
remembered
on
the
night
of
his
death
boasted
that
he
was
game
without
an
instant
hesitation
aaron
king
unbuckled
the
belt
that
held
his
weapon
and
turning
tossed
it
behind
him
with
the
gun
still
in
its
holster
at
the
other
end
of
the
ledge
james
rutlidge
set
his
rifle
behind
the
rock
deliberately
the
two
men
removed
their
coats
and
threw
aside
their
hats
for
a
moment
they
stood
eyeing
each
other
into
aaron
king
mind
flashed
the
memory
of
that
scene
at
the
fairlands
depot
when
moved
by
the
distress
of
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
he
had
first
spoken
to
the
man
who
faced
him
now
with
startling
vividness
the
incidents
of
their
acquaintance
came
to
him
in
succession
the
day
that
rutlidge
had
met
sibyl
in
the
studio
the
time
of
his
visit
to
the
camp
in
the
sycamore
grove
the
night
of
the
taine
banquet
a
hundred
things
that
had
strengthened
the
feeling
of
antagonism
which
had
marked
their
first
meeting
and
through
it
all
he
seemed
to
hear
conrad
lagrange
saying
that
in
his
story
of
life
this
character
name
was
sensual
the
artist
in
that
instant
knew
that
this
meeting
was
inevitable
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
the
two
men
who
in
their
lives
and
characters
represented
forces
so
antagonistic
stood
regarding
each
other
each
knowing
that
the
duel
would
be
must
be
to
the
death
deliberately
they
started
toward
the
center
of
the
ledge
over
their
heads
towered
the
great
cliff
a
thousand
feet
below
were
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
about
them
on
every
hand
the
silent
mighty
hills
watched
the
wild
and
lonely
wilderness
waited
as
they
drew
closer
together
they
moved
as
wrestlers
warily
crouching
silent
alert
stripped
to
their
shirts
and
trousers
they
were
both
splendid
physical
types
james
rutlidge
was
the
heavier
but
aaron
king
made
up
for
his
lack
in
weight
by
a
more
muscular
firmness
they
grappled
as
two
primitive
men
in
a
savage
age
might
have
met
bare
handed
they
came
together
locked
in
each
other
arms
their
limbs
entwined
with
set
faces
tugging
muscles
straining
sinews
and
taut
nerves
they
struggled
one
moment
they
crushed
against
the
rocky
wall
of
the
cliff
the
next
and
they
swayed
toward
the
edge
of
the
ledge
and
hung
over
the
dizzy
precipice
with
pounding
hearts
laboring
breath
and
clenched
teeth
they
wrestled
james
rutlidge
foot
slipped
on
the
rocky
floor
but
with
a
desperate
effort
he
regained
his
momentary
loss
aaron
king
worn
by
his
days
of
anxiety
by
his
sleepless
nights
and
by
the
long
hours
of
toil
over
the
mountains
without
sufficient
food
or
rest
felt
his
strength
going
slowly
the
weight
and
endurance
of
the
heavier
man
told
against
him
james
rutlidge
felt
it
and
his
eyes
were
beginning
to
blaze
with
savage
triumph
they
were
breathing
now
with
hoarse
sobbing
gasps
that
told
of
the
nearness
of
the
finish
slowly
aaron
king
weakened
rutlidge
spurred
to
increase
his
effort
and
exerting
every
ounce
of
his
strength
was
bearing
the
other
downward
and
back
at
that
instant
the
convict
and
sibyl
andr√©s
reached
the
cliff
with
a
cry
of
horror
the
girl
stood
as
though
turned
to
stone
motionless
without
a
word
the
convict
watched
the
struggling
men
with
a
sob
the
girl
stretched
forth
her
hands
in
a
low
voice
she
called
aaron
aaron
aaron
the
two
men
on
the
ledge
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
sibyl
spoke
again
almost
in
a
whisper
but
her
companion
heard
marston
marston
it
is
aaron
king
i
i
love
him
i
love
him
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
struggling
men
the
convict
answered
pray
girl
pray
pray
for
me
as
he
spoke
he
steadily
raised
his
rifle
to
his
shoulder
aaron
king
went
down
upon
one
knee
rutlidge
his
legs
braced
his
body
inclined
toward
the
edge
of
the
precipice
was
gathering
his
strength
for
the
last
triumphant
effort
the
convict
looking
along
his
steady
rifle
barrel
was
saying
again
pray
pray
for
me
girl
as
the
words
left
his
lips
his
finger
pressed
the
trigger
and
the
quiet
of
the
hills
was
broken
by
the
sharp
crack
of
the
rifle
james
rutlidge
hold
upon
the
artist
slipped
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
his
form
half
straightened
and
he
stood
nearly
erect
then
as
a
weed
cut
by
the
sharp
scythe
of
a
mower
falls
he
fell
his
body
whirling
downward
toward
the
trees
and
rocks
below
the
sound
of
the
crashing
branches
mingled
with
the
reverberating
report
of
the
shot
on
the
ledge
aaron
king
lay
still
the
convict
dropped
his
rifle
and
ran
forward
lifting
the
unconscious
man
in
his
arms
he
carried
him
a
little
way
down
the
mountain
toward
the
cabin
where
he
laid
him
gently
on
the
ground
to
sibyl
who
hung
over
the
artist
in
an
agony
of
loving
fear
he
said
hurriedly
he
be
all
right
presently
miss
andr√©s
i
fetch
his
coat
and
hat
running
back
to
the
ledge
he
caught
up
the
dead
man
rifle
coat
and
hat
and
threw
them
over
the
precipice
as
he
swiftly
crossed
for
the
artist
things
recovering
his
own
rifle
he
ran
back
to
the
girl
listen
miss
andr√©s
said
the
convict
speaking
quickly
king
will
be
all
right
in
a
few
minutes
that
will
likely
bring
his
friends
if
not
you
are
safe
now
anyway
i
dare
not
take
chances
from
where
she
sat
with
the
unconscious
man
head
in
her
lap
she
looked
at
him
wonderingly
she
repeated
questioningly
henry
marston
smiled
grimly
certainly
what
else
is
there
for
me
a
moment
later
she
saw
him
running
swiftly
down
the
mountainside
like
some
hunted
creature
of
the
wilderness
chapter
xxxix
the
better
way
alone
on
the
mountainside
with
the
man
who
had
awakened
the
pure
passion
of
her
woman
heart
sibyl
andr√©s
bent
over
the
unconscious
object
of
her
love
she
saw
his
face
unshaven
grimy
with
the
dirt
of
the
trail
and
the
sweat
of
the
fight
drawn
and
thin
with
the
mental
torture
that
had
driven
him
beyond
the
limit
of
his
physical
strength
she
saw
how
his
clothing
was
stained
and
torn
by
contact
with
sharp
rocks
and
thorns
and
bushes
she
saw
his
hands
the
hands
that
she
had
watched
at
their
work
upon
her
portrait
as
she
stood
among
the
roses
cut
and
bruised
caked
with
blood
and
dirt
and
seeing
these
things
she
understood
in
that
brief
moment
when
she
had
watched
aaron
king
in
the
struggle
upon
the
ledge
and
knowing
that
he
was
fighting
for
her
had
realized
her
love
for
him
all
that
taine
had
said
to
her
in
the
studio
was
swept
away
the
cruel
falsehoods
the
heartless
misrepresentations
the
vile
accusations
that
had
caused
her
to
seek
the
refuge
of
the
mountains
and
the
protection
of
her
childhood
friends
were
in
the
blaze
of
her
awakened
passion
burned
to
ashes
her
cry
to
the
convict
i
love
him
i
love
him
was
more
than
an
expression
of
her
love
it
was
a
triumphant
assertion
of
her
belief
in
his
love
for
her
it
was
her
answer
to
the
evil
seeing
world
that
could
not
comprehend
their
fellowship
as
the
life
within
the
man
forced
him
slowly
toward
consciousness
the
girl
natural
as
always
in
the
full
expression
of
herself
bent
over
him
with
tender
solicitude
with
endearing
words
she
kissed
his
brow
his
hair
his
hands
she
called
his
name
in
tones
of
affection
aaron
aaron
aaron
but
when
she
saw
that
he
was
about
to
awake
she
deftly
slipped
off
her
jacket
and
placing
it
under
his
head
drew
a
little
back
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
wonderingly
up
at
the
dark
pines
that
clothed
the
mountainsides
his
lips
moved
and
she
heard
her
name
sibyl
sibyl
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
her
cheeks
glowing
with
color
yes
mr
king
am
i
dreaming
again
he
said
slowly
gazing
at
her
as
though
struggling
to
command
his
senses
no
king
she
answered
cheerily
you
are
not
dreaming
carefully
as
one
striving
to
follow
a
thread
of
thought
in
a
bewildering
tangle
of
events
he
went
over
the
hours
just
past
i
was
up
on
that
peak
where
you
and
i
ate
lunch
the
day
you
tried
to
make
me
see
the
golden
state
limited
coming
down
from
the
pass
brian
oakley
sent
me
there
to
watch
for
buzzards
for
a
moment
he
turned
away
his
face
then
continued
i
saw
flashes
of
light
in
fairlands
and
on
granite
peak
i
left
a
note
for
brian
and
came
over
the
range
i
spent
one
night
on
the
way
i
found
tracks
on
the
peak
there
were
two
a
man
and
a
woman
i
followed
them
to
a
ledge
of
rock
at
the
head
of
a
canyon
he
paused
thus
far
the
thread
of
his
thought
was
clear
did
some
one
stop
me
was
there
was
there
a
fight
or
is
that
part
of
my
dream
no
she
said
softly
that
is
not
part
of
your
dream
and
it
was
james
rutlidge
who
stopped
me
as
i
was
going
to
you
yes
then
where
with
quick
energy
he
sat
up
and
grasped
her
arm
my
god
sibyl
miss
andr√©s
did
i
did
i
he
could
not
finish
the
sentence
but
sank
back
overcome
with
emotion
the
girl
spoke
quickly
with
a
clear
insistent
voice
that
rallied
his
mind
and
forced
him
to
command
himself
think
king
think
do
you
remember
nothing
more
you
were
struggling
your
strength
was
going
ca
you
remember
you
must
you
must
lifting
his
face
he
looked
at
her
was
there
a
he
asked
slowly
it
seems
to
me
that
something
in
my
brain
snapped
and
everything
went
black
was
there
a
yes
she
answered
and
i
did
not
i
did
not
no
you
did
not
kill
james
rutlidge
he
would
have
killed
you
but
for
the
shot
that
you
heard
and
rutlidge
is
he
is
dead
she
answered
simply
but
who
briefly
she
told
him
the
story
from
the
time
that
she
had
met
taine
in
the
studio
until
the
convict
had
left
her
a
few
minutes
before
and
now
she
finished
rising
quickly
we
must
go
down
to
the
cabin
there
is
food
there
you
must
be
nearly
starved
i
will
cook
supper
for
you
and
when
you
have
had
a
night
sleep
we
will
start
home
but
first
he
said
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
before
her
i
must
tell
you
something
i
should
have
told
you
before
but
i
was
waiting
until
i
thought
you
were
ready
to
hear
i
wonder
if
you
know
i
wonder
if
you
are
ready
to
hear
now
she
looked
him
frankly
in
the
eyes
as
she
answered
yes
i
know
what
you
want
to
tell
me
but
do
do
tell
me
here
she
shuddered
and
the
man
remembering
the
dead
body
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
understood
wait
she
said
until
we
are
home
and
you
will
come
to
me
when
you
are
ready
when
you
want
me
to
tell
you
he
said
yes
she
answered
softly
i
will
go
to
you
when
i
am
ready
at
the
cabin
in
the
gulch
the
girl
hastened
to
prepare
a
substantial
meal
there
was
no
one
now
to
fear
that
the
smoke
would
be
seen
later
with
cedar
boughs
and
blankets
she
made
a
bed
for
him
on
the
floor
near
the
when
he
would
have
helped
her
she
forbade
him
saying
that
he
was
her
guest
and
that
he
must
rest
to
be
ready
for
the
homeward
trip
softly
the
day
slipped
away
over
the
mountain
peaks
and
ridges
that
shut
them
in
softly
the
darkness
of
the
night
settled
down
in
the
rude
little
hut
in
the
lonely
gulch
the
man
and
the
woman
whose
lives
were
flowing
together
as
two
converging
streams
sat
by
the
fire
where
the
night
before
the
convict
had
told
that
girl
his
story
very
early
sibyl
insisted
that
her
companion
lie
down
to
sleep
upon
the
bed
she
had
made
when
he
protested
she
answered
laughing
very
well
then
but
you
will
be
obliged
to
sit
up
alone
and
with
a
good
night
she
retired
to
her
own
bed
in
another
corner
of
the
cabin
once
or
twice
he
spoke
to
her
but
when
she
did
not
answer
he
lay
down
upon
his
woodland
couch
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
fast
asleep
in
the
dim
light
of
the
embers
the
girl
slipped
from
her
bed
and
stole
quietly
across
the
room
to
the
to
lay
another
stick
of
wood
upon
the
glowing
coals
a
moment
she
stood
in
the
ruddy
light
looking
toward
the
sleeping
man
then
without
a
sound
she
stole
to
his
side
and
kneeling
softly
touched
his
forehead
with
her
lips
as
silently
she
crept
back
to
her
couch
all
that
afternoon
brian
oakley
had
been
following
with
trained
eyes
the
faintly
marked
trail
of
the
man
whose
dead
body
was
lying
now
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
when
the
darkness
came
the
mountaineer
ate
a
cold
supper
and
under
a
rude
shelter
quickly
improvised
by
his
skill
in
woodcraft
slept
beside
the
trail
near
the
head
of
clear
creek
jack
carleton
on
his
way
to
granite
peak
rolled
in
his
blanket
under
the
pines
somewhere
in
the
night
the
man
who
had
saved
sibyl
andr√©s
and
aaron
king
each
for
the
other
fled
like
a
fearful
hunted
thing
at
daybreak
sibyl
was
up
preparing
their
breakfast
but
so
quietly
did
she
move
about
her
homely
task
that
the
artist
did
not
awake
when
the
meal
was
ready
she
called
him
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
declaring
that
he
felt
himself
a
new
man
breakfast
over
they
set
out
at
once
when
they
came
to
the
cliff
at
the
head
of
the
gulch
the
girl
halted
and
shrinking
back
covered
her
face
with
trembling
hands
afraid
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
set
foot
upon
a
mountain
trail
gently
her
companion
led
her
across
the
ledge
and
a
little
way
back
from
the
rim
of
the
gorge
on
the
other
side
five
minutes
later
they
heard
a
shout
and
saw
brian
oakley
coming
toward
them
laughing
and
crying
sibyl
ran
to
meet
him
and
the
mountaineer
who
had
so
many
times
looked
death
in
the
face
unafraid
and
unmoved
wept
like
a
child
as
he
held
the
girl
in
his
arms
when
sibyl
and
aaron
had
related
briefly
the
events
that
led
up
to
their
meeting
with
the
ranger
and
he
in
turn
had
told
them
how
he
had
followed
the
track
of
the
automobile
and
finding
the
hidden
supplies
had
followed
the
trail
of
james
rutlidge
from
that
point
the
officer
asked
the
girl
several
questions
then
for
a
little
while
he
was
silent
while
they
guessing
his
thoughts
did
not
interrupt
finally
he
said
jack
is
due
at
granite
peak
sometime
about
noon
he
have
his
horse
and
with
sibyl
riding
we
make
it
back
down
to
the
head
of
clear
creek
by
dark
you
young
folks
just
wait
for
me
here
a
little
i
want
to
look
around
below
there
a
bit
as
he
started
toward
the
gulch
sibyl
sprang
to
her
feet
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
no
no
brian
oakley
you
shall
not
you
shall
not
do
it
holding
her
close
the
ranger
looked
down
into
her
pleading
eyes
smilingly
and
what
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
girlie
you
are
going
down
there
to
pick
up
the
trail
of
the
man
who
saved
aaron
who
saved
me
but
you
shall
not
do
it
i
do
care
if
you
are
an
officer
and
he
is
an
escaped
convict
i
will
not
let
you
do
anything
that
might
lead
to
his
capture
god
bless
you
child
answered
brian
oakley
the
only
escaped
convict
i
know
anything
about
this
last
year
according
to
my
belief
died
somewhere
in
the
mountains
if
you
do
believe
it
look
up
my
official
reports
on
the
matter
and
you
not
going
to
find
which
way
he
went
listen
sibyl
said
the
ranger
gravely
the
disappearance
of
james
rutlidge
prominent
as
he
was
will
be
heralded
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
the
newspapers
will
make
the
most
of
it
the
search
is
sure
to
be
carried
into
these
hills
for
that
automobile
trip
in
the
night
will
not
go
unquestioned
and
sheriff
walters
knows
too
much
of
my
suspicions
in
a
few
days
the
body
will
be
safely
past
recognition
even
should
it
be
discovered
through
the
buzzards
but
i
ca
take
chances
of
anything
durable
being
found
to
identify
the
man
who
fell
over
the
cliff
when
he
returned
to
them
two
hours
later
he
said
quietly
it
a
mighty
good
thing
i
went
down
it
was
a
nice
job
but
i
feel
better
we
can
forget
it
now
with
perfect
safety
remember
he
charged
them
impressively
even
to
myra
willard
and
conrad
lagrange
the
story
must
be
only
that
an
unknown
man
took
you
sibyl
from
your
horse
the
man
escaped
when
aaron
found
you
we
let
the
sheriff
or
whoever
can
solve
the
mystery
of
that
automobile
and
jim
rutlidge
disappearance
a
half
mile
from
granite
peak
they
met
jack
carleton
and
by
dark
as
brian
oakley
had
said
were
safely
down
to
the
head
of
clear
creek
having
come
by
routes
known
to
the
ranger
that
were
easier
and
shorter
than
the
roundabout
way
followed
by
the
convict
and
the
girl
it
was
just
past
midnight
when
the
three
friends
parted
from
young
carleton
and
crossed
the
canyon
to
sibyl
old
home
chapter
xl
facing
the
truth
as
brian
oakley
had
predicted
the
disappearance
of
james
rutlidge
occupied
columns
in
the
newspapers
from
coast
to
coast
in
every
article
he
was
headlined
as
a
distinguished
citizen
a
famous
critic
a
prominent
figure
in
the
world
of
art
one
of
the
greatest
living
authorities
leader
in
the
modern
school
of
powerful
influence
upon
the
artistic
production
of
the
age
the
story
of
the
unknown
mountain
girl
abduction
and
escape
was
a
news
item
of
a
single
day
but
the
disappearance
of
james
rutlidge
kept
the
press
busy
for
weeks
it
may
be
dismissed
here
with
the
simple
statement
that
the
mystery
has
never
been
solved
of
the
unknown
man
who
had
taken
sibyl
away
into
the
mountains
and
who
had
escaped
the
world
has
never
heard
of
the
convict
who
died
but
did
not
die
in
the
hills
the
world
knows
nothing
that
is
the
world
knows
nothing
of
the
man
in
this
connection
but
aaron
and
sibyl
some
years
later
knew
what
became
of
henry
marston
which
does
not
at
all
belong
to
this
story
upon
his
return
with
conrad
lagrange
to
their
home
in
the
orange
groves
aaron
king
plunged
into
his
work
with
a
purpose
very
different
from
the
motive
that
had
prompted
him
when
first
he
took
up
his
brushes
in
the
studio
that
looked
out
upon
the
mountains
and
the
rose
garden
day
after
day
as
he
gave
himself
to
his
great
picture
the
feast
of
materialism
he
knew
the
joy
of
the
worker
who
in
his
art
surrenders
himself
to
a
noble
purpose
a
joy
that
is
very
different
from
the
light
passing
pleasure
that
comes
from
the
mere
exercise
of
technical
skill
the
artist
did
not
now
need
to
drive
himself
to
his
task
as
the
begging
musician
on
the
street
corner
forces
himself
to
play
to
the
passing
crowd
for
the
pennies
that
are
dropped
in
his
tin
cup
rather
was
he
driven
by
the
conviction
of
a
great
truth
and
by
the
realization
of
its
woeful
need
in
the
world
to
such
adequate
expression
as
his
mastery
of
the
tools
of
his
craft
would
permit
he
was
not
now
the
slave
of
his
technical
knowledge
striving
to
produce
a
something
that
should
be
merely
technically
good
he
was
a
master
compelling
the
medium
of
his
art
to
serve
him
as
he
in
turn
was
compelled
to
serve
the
truth
that
had
mastered
him
sometimes
with
conrad
lagrange
he
went
for
an
evening
hour
to
the
little
house
next
door
sometimes
sibyl
and
myra
willard
would
drop
in
at
the
studio
in
the
afternoon
the
girl
never
now
came
alone
but
every
day
as
the
artist
worked
the
music
of
her
violin
came
to
him
out
of
the
orange
grove
with
its
message
from
the
hills
and
the
painter
at
his
easel
reading
aright
the
message
worked
and
waited
knowing
surely
that
when
she
was
ready
she
would
come
letters
from
taine
were
frequent
aaron
king
reading
them
nearly
always
under
the
quizzing
eyes
of
conrad
lagrange
whose
custom
it
was
to
bring
the
daily
mail
carefully
tore
them
into
little
pieces
and
dropped
them
into
the
waste
basket
without
comment
once
the
novelist
asked
with
mock
gravity
have
you
no
thought
for
the
day
of
judgment
young
man
do
you
not
know
that
your
sins
will
surely
find
you
out
the
artist
laughed
it
is
so
written
in
the
law
i
believe
the
other
continued
solemnly
your
recklessness
is
only
hastening
the
end
if
you
do
answer
those
letters
you
will
be
forced
shortly
to
meet
the
consequences
face
to
face
i
suppose
so
returned
the
painter
indifferently
but
i
have
my
answer
ready
you
know
you
mean
that
portrait
yes
the
novelist
laughed
grimly
i
think
it
will
do
the
trick
but
believe
me
there
will
be
consequences
the
artist
was
in
his
studio
at
work
upon
the
big
picture
when
taine
called
the
day
of
her
return
to
fairlands
it
was
well
on
in
the
afternoon
conrad
lagrange
and
czar
had
started
for
a
walk
but
had
gone
as
usual
only
as
far
as
the
neighboring
house
yee
kee
meeting
taine
at
the
door
explained
doubtfully
that
the
artist
was
at
his
work
he
would
go
tell
king
that
taine
was
here
never
mind
kee
i
will
tell
him
myself
she
answered
and
before
the
chinaman
could
protest
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
studio
damn
said
the
celestial
eloquently
and
retired
to
his
kitchen
to
ruminate
upon
the
ways
of
mellican
women
taine
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
studio
so
quietly
that
the
painter
standing
at
his
easel
and
engrossed
with
his
work
did
not
notice
her
presence
for
several
moments
the
woman
stood
watching
him
paying
no
heed
to
the
picture
seeing
only
the
man
when
he
did
not
look
around
she
said
are
you
too
busy
to
even
at
me
with
an
exclamation
he
faced
her
then
as
quickly
turned
again
with
hand
outstretched
to
draw
the
easel
curtain
but
as
though
obeying
a
second
thought
that
came
quickly
upon
the
heels
of
the
first
impulse
he
did
not
complete
the
movement
instead
he
laid
his
palette
and
brushes
beside
his
and
greeted
her
with
how
do
you
do
taine
when
did
you
return
to
fairlands
is
miss
taine
with
you
louise
is
abroad
she
answered
i
i
preferred
california
i
arrived
this
afternoon
she
went
a
step
toward
him
you
you
do
seem
very
glad
to
see
me
the
painter
colored
but
she
continued
impulsively
without
waiting
for
his
reply
if
you
only
knew
all
that
i
have
been
doing
for
you
the
wires
i
have
pulled
the
influences
i
have
interested
the
critics
and
newspaper
men
that
i
have
talked
to
of
course
i
could
do
anything
in
a
large
public
way
so
soon
after
taine
death
you
know
but
i
have
been
busy
just
the
same
and
everything
is
fixed
when
our
picture
is
exhibited
next
season
you
will
find
yourself
not
only
a
famous
painter
but
a
social
success
as
well
she
paused
when
he
still
did
not
speak
she
went
on
with
an
air
of
troubled
sadness
i
miss
jim
help
though
is
it
frightful
the
way
he
disappeared
where
do
you
suppose
he
is
i
ca
i
wo
believe
that
anything
has
happened
to
him
it
all
just
one
of
his
schemes
to
get
himself
talked
about
you
see
that
he
will
appear
again
safe
and
sound
when
the
papers
stop
filling
their
columns
about
him
i
know
jim
rutlidge
too
well
aaron
king
thought
of
those
bones
picked
bare
by
the
carrion
birds
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
day
he
said
commonplace
enough
no
doubt
if
one
only
had
the
key
to
it
taine
had
evidently
not
been
in
fairlands
long
enough
to
hear
the
story
of
sibyl
disappearance
for
which
the
artist
mentally
gave
thanks
i
am
glad
for
one
thing
continued
the
woman
her
mind
intent
upon
the
main
purpose
of
her
call
jim
had
already
written
a
splendid
criticism
of
your
picture
before
he
went
away
and
i
have
it
all
this
newspaper
talk
about
him
will
only
help
to
attract
attention
to
what
he
has
said
about
they
are
saying
such
nice
things
of
him
and
his
devotion
to
art
you
know
it
is
all
bound
to
help
you
she
waited
for
his
approval
and
for
some
expression
of
his
gratitude
i
fear
taine
he
said
slowly
that
you
are
making
a
mistake
she
laughed
nervously
and
answered
with
forced
gaiety
not
me
i
too
old
a
hand
at
the
game
not
to
know
just
how
far
i
dare
or
dare
not
go
i
do
not
mean
that
he
returned
i
mean
that
i
can
not
do
my
part
i
fear
you
are
mistaken
in
me
again
she
laughed
what
nonsense
i
like
for
you
to
be
modest
of
course
that
will
be
one
of
your
greatest
charms
but
if
you
are
worried
about
the
quality
of
your
work
forget
it
my
dear
boy
once
i
have
made
you
the
rage
no
one
will
stop
to
think
whether
your
pictures
are
good
or
bad
the
art
is
not
in
what
you
do
but
in
how
you
get
it
before
the
world
ask
conrad
lagrange
if
i
am
not
right
as
to
that
returned
the
artist
lagrange
agrees
with
you
perfectly
but
what
is
this
that
you
are
doing
now
will
it
be
ready
for
the
exhibition
too
she
looked
past
him
at
the
big
canvas
and
he
watching
her
curiously
stepped
aside
parts
of
the
picture
were
little
more
than
sketched
in
but
still
line
and
color
spoke
with
accusing
truth
the
spirit
of
the
company
that
had
gathered
at
the
banquet
in
the
home
on
fairlands
heights
the
night
of
taine
death
the
figures
were
not
portraits
it
is
true
but
they
expressed
with
striking
fidelity
the
lives
and
characters
of
those
who
had
that
night
been
assembled
by
taine
to
meet
the
artist
the
figure
in
the
picture
standing
with
uplifted
glass
and
drunken
pose
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
bestial
face
limbs
and
dying
licentious
eyes
fixed
upon
the
beautiful
girl
musician
might
easily
have
been
taine
himself
the
distinguished
writers
and
critics
the
representatives
of
the
social
world
and
of
wealth
conrad
lagrange
with
cold
cynical
mocking
smile
taine
with
her
pretense
of
modest
dress
that
only
emphasized
her
immodesty
and
in
the
midst
of
the
unclean
minded
crew
the
lovely
innocence
and
the
unconscious
purity
of
the
mountain
girl
with
her
violin
offering
to
them
that
which
they
were
incapable
of
receiving
it
was
all
there
upon
the
canvas
as
the
artist
had
seen
it
that
night
the
picture
cried
aloud
the
intellectual
degradation
and
the
spiritual
depravity
of
that
class
who
arrogating
to
themselves
the
authority
of
leaders
in
culture
and
art
by
their
approval
and
patronage
of
dangerous
falsehood
and
sham
in
picture
or
story
make
possible
such
characters
as
james
rutlidge
aaron
king
watching
taine
as
she
looked
at
the
picture
on
the
easel
saw
a
look
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
come
over
her
face
once
she
turned
toward
him
as
if
to
speak
but
without
a
word
looked
again
at
the
canvas
she
seemed
perplexed
and
puzzled
as
though
she
caught
glimpses
of
something
in
the
picture
that
she
did
not
rightly
understand
then
as
she
looked
her
eyes
kindled
with
contemptuous
scorn
and
there
was
a
pronounced
sneer
in
her
cold
tones
as
she
said
really
i
do
believe
i
care
for
you
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
she
laughed
shortly
it
reminds
one
a
little
of
that
dinner
at
our
house
do
you
think
it
the
girl
with
the
violin
i
suppose
there
are
no
portraits
in
it
taine
said
the
artist
quietly
no
well
i
think
you
better
stick
to
your
portraits
this
is
a
great
picture
though
she
admitted
thoughtfully
it
it
grips
you
so
i
seem
to
get
away
from
it
i
can
see
that
it
will
create
a
sensation
but
just
the
same
i
do
like
it
it
not
nice
like
your
portrait
of
me
by
the
way
and
she
turned
eagerly
from
the
big
canvas
as
though
glad
to
escape
a
distasteful
subject
do
you
remember
that
i
have
never
seen
my
picture
yet
where
do
you
keep
it
the
painter
indicated
another
easel
near
the
one
upon
which
he
was
at
work
it
is
there
mrs
taine
oh
she
said
with
a
pleased
smile
you
keep
it
on
the
easel
still
playfully
she
added
do
you
look
at
it
often
that
you
have
it
so
handy
yes
said
the
artist
i
must
admit
that
i
have
looked
at
it
frequently
he
did
not
explain
why
he
looked
at
her
portrait
while
he
was
working
upon
the
larger
picture
how
nice
of
you
she
answered
please
let
me
see
it
now
i
remember
when
you
wanted
to
repaint
it
you
said
you
would
put
on
the
canvas
just
what
you
thought
of
me
have
you
i
wonder
i
would
rather
that
you
judge
for
yourself
taine
he
answered
and
drew
the
curtain
that
hid
the
painting
as
the
woman
looked
upon
that
portrait
of
herself
into
which
aaron
king
had
painted
with
all
the
skill
at
his
command
everything
that
he
had
seen
in
her
face
as
she
posed
for
him
she
stood
a
moment
as
though
stunned
then
with
a
gesture
of
horror
and
shame
she
shrank
back
as
though
the
painted
thing
accused
her
of
being
what
indeed
she
really
was
turning
to
the
artist
imploringly
she
whispered
is
it
is
it
true
am
i
am
i
aaron
king
remembering
how
she
had
sent
the
girl
he
loved
so
nearly
to
a
shameful
end
and
thinking
of
those
bones
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
answered
justly
at
least
madam
there
is
more
truth
in
that
picture
than
in
the
things
you
said
to
miss
andr√©s
here
in
this
room
the
day
you
left
fairlands
her
face
went
white
with
quick
rage
but
controling
herself
she
said
and
where
is
the
picture
of
your
i
should
like
to
see
it
again
please
gladly
madam
returned
the
artist
because
you
are
a
woman
it
is
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
your
charge
which
permit
me
to
say
is
as
false
as
that
portrait
of
you
is
true
quickly
he
pushed
another
easel
to
a
position
beside
the
one
that
held
taine
portrait
and
drew
the
curtain
the
effect
for
a
moment
silenced
even
taine
but
only
for
a
moment
a
character
that
is
the
product
of
certain
years
of
schooling
in
the
thought
and
spirit
of
the
class
in
which
taine
belonged
is
not
transformed
by
a
single
exhibition
of
painted
truth
from
the
two
portraits
the
woman
turned
to
the
larger
canvas
then
she
faced
the
artist
you
fool
she
said
with
bitter
rage
o
you
fool
do
you
think
that
you
will
ever
be
permitted
to
exhibit
such
trash
as
this
she
waved
her
hand
to
include
the
three
paintings
do
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
drag
you
up
the
ladder
of
social
position
to
fame
and
to
wealth
for
such
reward
as
that
she
singled
out
her
own
portrait
bah
you
are
impossible
impossible
i
have
been
mad
to
think
that
i
could
make
anything
out
of
you
as
for
your
idiotic
claim
that
you
have
painted
the
truth
she
seized
a
large
palette
knife
that
lay
with
the
artist
tools
upon
the
table
and
springing
to
her
portrait
hacked
and
mutilated
the
canvas
the
artist
stood
motionless
making
no
effort
to
stop
her
when
the
picture
was
utterly
defaced
she
threw
it
at
his
feet
for
your
truth
mr
king
with
a
quick
motion
she
turned
toward
the
other
portrait
but
the
artist
who
had
guessed
her
purpose
caught
her
hand
that
picture
was
yours
madam
this
one
is
mine
there
was
a
significant
ring
of
triumph
in
his
voice
neither
aaron
king
nor
taine
had
noticed
three
people
who
had
entered
the
rose
garden
from
the
orange
grove
through
the
little
gate
in
the
corner
of
the
hedge
conrad
lagrange
myra
willard
and
sibyl
were
going
to
the
studio
deliberately
bent
upon
interrupting
the
artist
at
his
work
they
sometimes
as
conrad
lagrange
put
it
made
thus
a
crew
of
three
dragging
the
painter
to
safety
when
the
waves
of
inspiration
were
about
to
overwhelm
him
czar
of
course
took
an
active
part
in
these
rescues
as
the
three
friends
approached
the
trellised
arch
that
opened
from
the
garden
into
the
yard
a
few
feet
from
the
studio
door
the
sound
of
taine
angry
voice
came
clearly
through
the
open
window
conrad
lagrange
stopped
evidently
king
has
company
he
said
dryly
it
is
taine
is
it
not
asked
sibyl
quietly
recognizing
the
woman
voice
yes
answered
the
novelist
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
said
hurriedly
come
sibyl
we
must
go
back
we
will
not
disturb
king
now
lagrange
you
two
come
over
this
evening
they
saw
her
face
white
and
frightened
i
believe
i
go
back
with
you
if
you
do
mind
returned
conrad
lagrange
with
his
twisted
grin
i
do
think
i
want
any
of
that
in
there
either
to
the
dog
who
was
moving
toward
the
studio
door
he
added
here
czar
you
must
interrupt
the
lady
you
not
in
her
class
they
were
moving
away
when
taine
voice
came
again
clearly
and
distinctly
through
the
window
oh
very
well
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
possession
i
promise
you
though
that
the
world
shall
never
hear
of
this
portrait
of
your
mistress
if
you
dare
try
to
exhibit
it
i
shall
see
that
the
people
to
whom
you
must
look
for
your
patronage
know
how
you
found
the
original
an
innocent
mountain
girl
and
brought
her
to
your
studio
to
live
with
you
fairlands
has
already
talked
enough
but
my
influence
has
prevented
it
from
going
too
far
you
may
be
very
sure
that
from
now
on
i
shall
not
exert
myself
to
deny
it
the
artist
friends
in
the
rose
garden
again
stopped
involuntarily
sibyl
uttered
a
low
exclamation
conrad
lagrange
looked
at
myra
willard
i
think
he
said
in
a
low
tone
that
the
time
has
come
can
you
do
it
yes
i
i
must
returned
the
woman
she
spoke
to
the
girl
who
being
a
little
in
advance
had
not
heard
the
novelist
words
sibyl
dear
will
you
go
on
home
please
mr
lagrange
will
stay
with
me
i
i
will
join
you
presently
at
a
look
from
conrad
lagrange
the
girl
obeyed
go
with
sibyl
czar
said
the
novelist
and
the
girl
and
the
dog
went
quickly
away
through
the
garden
in
the
studio
aaron
king
gazed
at
the
angry
woman
in
amazement
taine
he
said
with
quiet
dignity
i
must
tell
you
that
i
hope
to
make
miss
andr√©s
my
wife
she
laughed
harshly
and
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
thought
that
if
you
knew
it
might
help
you
to
understand
the
situation
he
answered
simply
i
understand
the
situation
very
well
she
retorted
but
you
do
not
appear
to
the
situation
is
this
i
i
was
interested
in
you
as
an
artist
i
because
my
position
in
the
world
enabled
me
to
help
you
commissioned
you
to
paint
my
portrait
you
are
unknown
with
no
name
no
place
in
the
world
i
could
have
given
you
success
i
could
have
introduced
you
to
the
people
that
you
must
know
if
you
are
to
succeed
my
influence
would
insure
you
a
favorable
reception
from
those
who
make
the
reputations
of
men
like
you
i
could
have
made
you
the
rage
i
could
have
made
you
famous
and
now
now
he
said
calmly
you
will
exert
your
influence
to
hinder
me
in
my
work
because
i
have
not
pleased
you
you
will
use
whatever
power
you
have
to
ruin
me
is
that
what
you
mean
mrs
taine
you
have
made
your
choice
you
must
take
the
consequences
she
replied
coldly
and
turned
to
leave
the
studio
in
the
doorway
stood
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
conrad
lagrange
stood
near
xli
marks
of
the
beast
when
taine
would
have
passed
out
of
the
studio
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
said
wait
madam
i
must
speak
to
you
aaron
king
recalled
that
strange
scene
at
the
depot
the
day
of
his
arrival
in
fairlands
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
returned
taine
coldly
stand
aside
please
but
conrad
lagrange
quietly
closed
the
door
i
think
taine
he
remarked
dryly
than
you
will
be
interested
in
what
miss
willard
has
to
say
oh
very
well
returned
the
other
making
the
best
of
the
situation
evidently
you
heard
what
i
just
said
to
your
protege
the
novelist
answered
we
did
accept
my
compliments
madam
you
did
it
very
nicely
thanks
she
retorted
i
see
you
still
play
your
role
of
protector
you
might
tell
your
charge
whether
or
not
i
am
mistaken
as
to
the
probable
result
of
his
ah
artistic
conscientiousness
king
knows
that
you
are
not
you
have
indeed
put
the
situation
rather
mildly
it
is
a
sad
fact
but
a
fact
that
the
noblest
work
is
often
forced
to
remain
unrecognized
and
unknown
to
the
world
by
the
same
methods
that
are
used
to
exalt
the
unworthy
you
undoubtedly
have
the
power
of
which
you
boast
taine
but
but
what
she
said
triumphantly
you
think
i
will
hesitate
to
use
my
influence
i
you
will
not
use
it
in
this
case
came
the
unexpected
answer
she
laughed
mockingly
and
why
not
what
will
prevent
the
one
thing
on
earth
that
you
fear
madam
answered
conrad
lagrange
the
eyes
of
the
world
aaron
king
listened
amazed
i
do
think
i
understand
said
taine
coldly
no
that
is
what
miss
willard
proposes
to
explain
returned
the
novelist
she
turned
haughtily
toward
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
what
can
this
poor
creature
say
to
anything
i
propose
myra
willard
answered
gently
sadly
have
you
no
kindness
no
sympathy
at
all
madam
is
there
nothing
but
cruel
selfishness
in
your
heart
you
are
insolent
retorted
the
other
sharply
say
what
you
have
to
say
and
be
brief
myra
willard
drew
close
to
the
woman
and
looked
long
and
searchingly
into
her
face
the
other
returned
her
gaze
with
contemptuous
indifference
i
have
been
sorry
for
you
said
myra
willard
slowly
i
have
not
wished
to
speak
but
i
know
what
you
said
to
sibyl
here
in
the
studio
and
i
overheard
what
you
said
to
king
a
few
minutes
ago
i
can
not
keep
silent
proceed
said
taine
shortly
say
what
you
have
to
say
and
be
done
with
it
myra
willard
obeyed
taine
years
ago
your
guardian
the
father
of
james
rutlidge
won
the
love
of
a
young
girl
it
does
not
matter
who
she
was
she
was
beautiful
and
innocent
that
was
her
misfortune
beauty
and
innocence
often
bring
pain
and
sorrow
madam
in
a
world
where
there
are
too
many
men
like
rutlidge
and
his
son
the
girl
thought
the
man
she
did
not
know
him
by
his
real
name
her
lover
she
thought
that
he
became
her
husband
a
baby
was
born
to
the
girl
who
believed
herself
a
wife
and
the
young
mother
was
happy
for
a
short
time
she
was
very
happy
then
the
awakening
came
the
girl
mother
was
holding
her
baby
to
her
breast
and
singing
as
happy
mothers
do
when
a
strange
woman
appeared
in
the
open
door
of
the
room
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
richly
dressed
but
her
face
was
distorted
with
passion
the
young
mother
did
not
understand
she
did
not
know
then
that
the
woman
was
rutlidge
the
true
wife
of
the
father
of
her
child
she
knew
that
afterward
the
woman
in
the
doorway
lifted
her
hand
as
though
to
throw
something
and
the
mother
instinctively
bowed
her
head
to
shield
her
baby
then
something
that
burned
like
fire
struck
her
face
and
neck
she
screamed
in
agony
and
fainted
the
rest
of
the
story
does
not
matter
i
think
the
injured
mother
was
taken
to
the
hospital
when
she
recovered
she
learned
that
rutlidge
was
dead
a
suicide
later
rutlidge
took
the
baby
to
raise
as
his
ward
telling
the
world
that
the
child
was
the
daughter
of
a
relative
who
had
died
at
its
birth
you
must
understand
that
when
the
disfigured
mother
of
the
baby
came
to
know
the
truth
she
believed
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
little
one
if
the
facts
of
its
birth
were
never
known
the
wealthy
rutlidge
could
give
his
ward
every
advantage
of
culture
and
social
position
the
child
would
grow
to
womanhood
with
no
stain
upon
her
name
because
she
felt
she
owed
her
baby
this
the
only
thing
that
she
could
give
her
the
mother
consented
and
disappeared
madam
finished
myra
willard
slowly
a
little
of
the
acid
that
burned
that
mother
face
fell
upon
the
shoulder
of
her
illegitimate
baby
god
exclaimed
the
artist
throughout
myra
willard
story
taine
stood
like
a
woman
of
stone
at
the
end
she
gazed
at
the
woman
disfigured
face
as
though
fascinated
with
horror
while
her
hands
moved
to
finger
the
buttons
of
her
dress
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
as
though
under
some
strange
spell
without
removing
her
gaze
from
myra
willard
marred
features
she
opened
the
waist
of
her
dress
and
bared
to
them
her
right
shoulder
it
was
marked
by
a
broad
scar
like
the
scars
that
disfigured
the
face
of
her
mother
myra
willard
started
forward
impelled
by
the
mother
instinct
my
baby
my
poor
poor
girl
the
words
broke
the
spell
drawing
back
with
an
air
of
cold
unconquerable
pride
the
woman
looked
at
conrad
lagrange
and
now
she
said
as
she
swiftly
rearranged
her
dress
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
why
you
have
done
this
myra
willard
turned
away
to
sink
into
a
chair
white
and
trembling
aaron
king
stepped
quickly
to
her
side
and
placing
his
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
waited
for
the
novelist
to
speak
miss
willard
told
you
this
story
because
i
asked
her
to
said
conrad
lagrange
i
asked
her
to
tell
you
because
it
gives
me
the
power
to
protect
the
two
people
who
are
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
world
still
in
your
role
of
protector
i
see
sneered
taine
exactly
madam
it
happens
that
i
was
a
reporter
on
a
certain
newspaper
when
the
incidents
just
related
occurred
i
wrote
the
story
for
the
press
in
fact
it
was
the
story
that
gave
me
my
start
in
yellow
journalism
from
which
i
graduated
the
novelist
of
your
acquaintance
i
know
the
newspaper
game
thoroughly
taine
i
know
the
truth
of
this
story
that
you
have
just
heard
permit
me
to
say
that
i
know
how
to
write
in
the
approved
newspaper
style
and
to
add
that
my
name
insures
a
wide
hearing
proceed
to
carry
out
your
threats
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
give
this
attractive
bit
of
news
in
all
its
colorful
details
to
every
newspaper

the
land
ca
you
see
the
headlines
revelation
secret
of
the
beautiful
taine
shoulders
a
leader
in
the
social
world
makes
modesty
her
fad
parentage
of
a
social
leader
do
you
understand
madam
use
your
influence
to
interfere
with
or
to
hinder
king
in
his
work
or
fail
to
use
your
influence
to
contradict
the
lies
you
have
already
started
about
the
character
of
miss
andr√©s
and
i
will
use
the
influence
of
my
pen
and
the
prestige
of
my
name
to
put
you
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
for
what
you
are
for
a
moment
the
woman
looked
at
him
defiantly
then
as
she
grasped
the
full
significance
of
what
he
had
said
she
slowly
bowed
her
head
conrad
lagrange
opened
the
door
as
she
went
out
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
started
forward
holding
out
her
hands
appealingly
taine
did
not
look
back
but
went
quickly
toward
the
big
automobile
that
was
waiting
in
front
of
the
house
chapter
xlii
aaron
king
success
the
winter
months
were
past
aaron
king
was
sitting
before
his
finished
picture
the
colors
were
still
fresh
upon
the
canvas
that
hangs
in
an
honored
place
in
one
of
the
great
galleries
of
the
world
to
the
last
careful
touch
the
artist
had
put
into
his
painted
message
the
best
he
had
to
give
back
of
every
line
and
there
was
the
deep
conviction
of
a
worthy
motive
for
an
hour
he
had
been
sitting
there
before
the
easel
brush
and
palette
in
hand
without
touching
the
canvas
he
could
do
no
more
laying
aside
his
tools
he
went
to
his
desk
and
took
from
the
drawer
that
package
of
his
mother
letters
he
pushed
a
deep
in
front
of
his
picture
and
again
seated
himself
as
he
read
letter
after
letter
he
lifted
his
eyes
at
almost
every
sentence
from
the
written
pages
to
his
work
it
was
as
though
he
were
submitting
his
picture
to
a
final
test
as
indeed
he
was
he
had
reached
the
last
letter
when
conrad
lagrange
entered
the
studio
czar
at
his
heels
every
day
while
the
picture
was
growing
under
the
artist
hand
his
friend
had
watched
it
take
on
beauty
and
power
he
did
not
need
to
speak
of
the
finished
painting
now
well
lad
he
said
the
old
letters
again
the
artist
caressing
the
dog
silky
head
as
it
was
thrust
against
his
knee
answered
yes
i
finished
the
picture
two
hours
ago
i
have
been
having
a
private
exhibition
all
on
my
own
hook
listen
from
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
read
it
is
right
for
you
to
be
ambitious
my
son
i
would
not
have
you
otherwise
without
a
strong
desire
to
reach
some
height
that
in
the
distance
lifts
above
the
level
of
the
present
a
man
becomes
a
laggard
on
the
highway
of
life
a
mere
loafer
by
the
wayside
slothful
indolent
slipping
easily
as
the
years
go
into
the
most
despicable
of
places
the
place
of
a
human
parasite
that
contributing
nothing
to
the
wealth
of
the
race
feeds
upon
the
strength
of
the
multitude
of
toilers
who
pass
him
by
but
ambition
my
boy
is
like
to
all
the
other
gifts
that
lead
men
godward
it
must
be
a
noble
ambition
nobly
controlled
a
mere
striving
for
place
and
power
without
a
saving
sense
of
the
responsibility
conferred
by
that
place
and
power
is
ignoble
such
an
ambition
i
know
as
you
will
some
day
come
to
understand
is
not
a
blessing
but
a
curse
it
is
the
curse
from
which
our
age
is
suffering
sorely
and
which
if
it
be
not
lifted
will
continue
to
vitiate
the
strength
and
poison
the
life
of
the
race
because
i
would
have
your
ambition
a
safe
and
worthy
ambition
aaron
i
ask
that
the
supreme
and
final
test
of
any
work
that
comes
from
your
hand
may
be
this
that
it
satisfy
you
yourself
that
you
may
be
not
ashamed
to
sit
down
alone
with
your
work
and
thus
to
look
it
squarely
in
the
face
not
critics
nor
authorities
not
popular
opinion
not
even
law
or
religion
must
be
the
court
of
final
appeal
when
you
are
by
what
you
do
brought
to
bar
but
by
you
the
judgment
must
be
rendered
and
this
too
is
true
my
son
by
that
judgment
and
that
judgment
alone
you
will
truly
live
or
you
will
truly
die
and
that
said
the
novelist
so
famous
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
so
infamous
in
his
own
sight
and
that
is
what
she
tried
to
make
me
believe
when
she
and
i
were
young
together
but
i
would
not
i
would
not
accept
it
i
thought
if
i
could
win
fame
that
she
he
checked
himself
suddenly
but
you
have
led
me
to
accept
it
old
man
cried
the
artist
heartily
you
have
opened
my
eyes
you
have
helped
me
to
understand
my
mother
as
i
never
could
have
understood
her
alone
conrad
lagrange
smiled
perhaps
he
admitted
whimsically
no
doubt
good
may
sometimes
be
accomplished
by
the
presentation
of
a
horrible
example
but
go
on
with
your
private
exhibition
i
not
keep
you
longer
come
czar
in
spite
of
the
artist
protests
he
left
the
studio
while
the
painter
was
putting
away
his
letters
the
novelist
and
the
dog
went
through
the
rose
garden
and
the
orange
grove
straight
to
the
little
house
next
door
they
walked
as
though
on
a
definite
mission
sibyl
and
myra
willard
were
sitting
on
the
porch
howdy
neighbor
called
the
girl
as
the
tall
ungainly
form
of
the
famous
novelist
appeared
you
seem
to
be
the
bearer
of
news
what
is
the
latest
word
from
the
seat
of
war
it
is
finished
said
conrad
lagrange
returning
myra
gentle
greeting
and
accepting
the
chair
that
sibyl
offered
the
picture
said
the
girl
eagerly
a
quick
color
flushing
her
cheeks
is
the
picture
finished
finished
returned
the
novelist
i
just
left
him
mooning
over
it
like
a
mother
over
a
baby
they
laughed
together
and
when
a
moment
later
the
girl
slipped
into
the
house
and
did
not
return
the
woman
with
the
disfigured
face
and
the
famous
novelist
looked
at
each
other
with
smiling
eyes
when
czar
with
sudden
interest
started
around
the
corner
of
the
house
his
master
said
suggestively
czar
you
better
stay
here
with
the
old
folks
passing
through
the
house
and
out
of
the
kitchen
door
sibyl
ran
lightly
through
the
orange
grove
to
the
little
gate
in
the
corner
of
the
ragged
robin
hedge
a
moment
she
paused
hesitating
then
stealing
cautiously
into
the
rose
garden
she
darted
in
quick
flight
to
the
shelter
of
the
arbor
where
she
parted
the
screen
of
vines
to
gain
a
view
of
the
studio
between
the
big
north
window
and
the
window
that
opened
into
the
garden
she
saw
the
artist
she
saw
too
the
big
canvas
upon
the
easel
but
aaron
king
was
not
now
looking
at
his
work
just
finished
he
was
sitting
before
that
other
picture
into
which
he
had
unconsciously
painted
not
only
the
truth
that
he
saw
in
the
winsome
loveliness
of
the
girl
who
posed
for
him
with
outstretshed
hands
among
the
roses
but
his
love
for
her
as
well
with
a
low
laugh
sibyl
drew
back
swiftly
as
she
had
reached
the
arbor
she
crossed
the
garden
and
a
moment
later
paused
at
the
studio
door
again
she
hesitated
then
gently
so
gently
that
the
artist
lost
in
his
dreams
did
not
hear
she
opened
the
door
for
a
little
she
stood
watching
him
softly
she
took
a
few
steps
toward
him
the
artist
as
though
sensing
her
presence
started
and
looked
around
she
was
standing
as
she
stood
in
the
picture
her
hands
outstretched
a
smile
of
welcome
on
her
lips
the
light
of
gladness
in
her
eyes
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
before
the
easel
she
went
to
him
not
many
days
later
there
was
a
quiet
wedding
at
sibyl
old
home
in
the
hills
besides
the
two
young
people
and
the
clergyman
only
brian
oakley
oakley
conrad
lagrange
and
myra
willard
were
present
these
friends
who
had
prepared
the
old
place
for
the
mating
ones
after
a
simple
dinner
following
the
ceremony
returned
down
the
canyon
to
the
station
standing
arm
in
arm
where
the
old
road
turns
around
the
cedar
thicket
and
where
the
artist
had
first
seen
the
girl
sibyl
and
aaron
watched
them
go
from
the
other
side
of
roaring
clear
creek
they
turned
to
wave
hats
and
handkerchiefs
the
two
in
the
shadow
of
the
cedars
answered
czar
barked
joyful
congratulations
and
the
wagon
disappeared
in
the
wilderness
growth
instead
of
turning
back
to
the
house
behind
them
the
two
without
speaking
as
though
obeying
a
common
impulse
set
out
down
the
canyon
a
little
later
they
stood
in
the
old
spring
glade
where
the
alders
bore
still
in
the
smooth
gray
bark
of
their
trunks
the
memories
of
lovers
where
the
light
fell
slanting
softly
through
the
screen
of
leaf
and
branch
and
vine
and
upon
the
granite
boulder
and
the
waters
of
the
spring
as
through
the
window
traceries
of
a
vast
and
quiet
cathedral
and
where
the
distant
roar
of
the
mountain
stream
trembled
in
the
air
like
the
deep
tones
of
some
great
organ
sibyl
dressed
in
her
brown
mountain
costume
was
sitting
on
the
boulder
when
the
artist
said
softly
look
lifting
her
eyes
as
he
pointed
she
saw
two
butterflies
it
might
almost
have
been
the
same
two
with
zigzag
flight
through
the
opening
in
the
draperies
of
with
parted
lips
and
flushed
cheeks
the
girl
watched
then
as
the
beautiful
creatures
in
their
aerial
waltz
whirled
above
her
head
she
rose
and
lightly
gracefully
almost
as
her
winged
companions
accompanied
them
in
their
dance
the
winged
emblems
of
innocence
and
purity
flitted
away
over
the
willow
wall
the
girl
with
bright
eyes
and
smiling
lips
half
laughing
half
serious
looked
toward
her
mate
he
held
out
his
arms
and
she
went
to
him
the
end
