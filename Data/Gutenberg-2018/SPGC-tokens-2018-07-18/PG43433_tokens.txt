chapter
vi
in
other
lands
the
at
first
sight
the
interpretation
of
the
european
fire
customs
as
charms
for
making
sunshine
is
confirmed
by
a
parallel
custom
observed
by
the
hindoos
of
southern
india
at
the
pongol
or
feast
of
ingathering
the
festival
is
celebrated
in
the
early
part
of
january
when
according
to
hindoo
astrologers
the
sun
enters
the
tropic
of
capricorn
and
the
chief
event
of
the
festival
coincides
with
the
passage
of
the
sun
for
some
days
previously
the
boys
gather
heaps
of
sticks
straw
dead
leaves
and
everything
that
will
burn
on
the
morning
of
the
first
day
of
the
festival
the
heaps
are
fired
every
street
and
lane
has
its
bonfire
the
young
folk
leap
over
the
flames
or
pile
on
fresh
fuel
this
fire
is
an
offering
to
sûrya
the
or
to
agni
the
deity
of
fire
it
wakes
him
from
his
sleep
calling
on
him
again
to
gladden
the
earth
with
his
light
and
if
this
is
indeed
the
explanation
which
the
people
themselves
give
of
the
festival
it
seems
decisive
in
favour
of
the
solar
explanation
of
the
fires
for
to
say
that
the
fires
waken
the
from
his
sleep
is
only
a
metaphorical
or
mythical
way
of
saying
that
they
actually
help
to
rekindle
the
sun
s
light
and
heat
but
the
hesitation
which
the
writer
indicates
between
the
two
distinct
deities
of
sun
and
fire
seems
to
prove
that
he
is
merely
giving
his
own
interpretation
of
the
rite
not
reporting
the
views
of
the
celebrants
if
that
is
so
the
expression
of
his
opinion
has
no
claim
to
authority
a
festival
of
northern
india
which
presents
points
of
resemblance
to
the
popular
european
celebrations
which
we
have
been
considering
is
the
holi
this
is
a
village
festival
held
in
early
spring
at
the
full
moon
of
the
month
phalgun
large
bonfires
are
lit
and
young
people
dance
round
them
the
people
believe
that
the
fires
prevent
blight
and
that
the
ashes
cure
disease
at
barsana
the
local
village
priest
is
expected
to
pass
through
the
holi
bonfire
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
faithful
can
not
burn
him
indeed
he
holds
his
land
simply
on
the
score
of
his
being
on
one
occasion
when
the
priest
disappointed
the
expectant
crowd
by
merely
jumping
over
the
outermost
verge
of
the
smouldering
ashes
and
then
bolting
into
his
cell
they
threatened
to
deprive
him
of
his
benefice
if
he
did
not
discharge
his
spiritual
functions
better
when
the
next
holi
season
came
round
another
feature
of
the
festival
which
has
or
once
had
its
counterpart
in
the
corresponding
european
ceremonies
is
the
unchecked
profligacy
which
prevails
among
the
hindoos
at
this
time
in
kumaon
a
district
of
india
at
the
foot
of
the
himalayas
each
clan
celebrates
the
holi
festival
by
cutting
down
a
tree
which
is
thereupon
stripped
of
its
leaves
decked
with
shreds
of
cloth
and
burnt
at
some
convenient
place
in
the
quarter
of
the
town
inhabited
by
the
clan
some
of
the
songs
sung
on
this
occasion
are
of
a
ribald
character
the
people
leap
over
the
ashes
of
the
fire
believing
that
they
thus
rid
themselves
of
itch
and
other
diseases
of
the
skin
while
the
trees
are
burning
each
clan
tries
to
carry
off
strips
of
cloth
from
the
tree
of
another
clan
and
success
in
the
attempt
is
thought
to
ensure
good
luck
in
gwalior
large
heaps
of
are
burnt
instead
of
trees
among
the
marwaris
the
festival
is
celebrated
by
the
women
with
obscene
songs
and
gestures
a
monstrous
and
disgusting
image
of
a
certain
nathuram
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
notorious
profligate
is
set
up
in
a
bazaar
and
then
smashed
with
blows
of
shoes
and
bludgeons
while
the
bonfire
of
is
blazing
no
household
can
be
without
an
image
of
nathuram
and
on
the
night
when
the
bride
first
visits
her
husband
the
image
of
this
disreputable
personage
is
placed
beside
her
couch
barren
women
and
mothers
whose
children
have
died
look
to
nathuram
for
deliverance
from
their
troubles
various
stories
are
told
to
account
for
the
origin
of
the
holi
festival
according
to
one
legend
it
was
instituted
in
order
to
get
rid
of
a
troublesome
demon
the
people
were
directed
to
kindle
a
bonfire
and
circumambulate
it
singing
and
uttering
fearlessly
whatever
might
come
into
their
minds
appalled
by
these
vociferations
by
the
oblations
to
fire
and
by
the
laughter
of
the
children
the
demon
was
to
be
destroyed
in
the
chinese
province
of
we
also
meet
with
a
vernal
festival
of
fire
which
may
be
compared
to
the
of
europe
the
ceremony
according
to
an
eminent
authority
is
a
solar
festival
in
honour
of
the
renewal
of
vegetation
and
of
the
vernal
warmth
it
falls
in
april
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
third
month
in
the
chinese
calendar
and
is
doubtless
connected
with
the
ancient
custom
of
renewing
the
fire
which
as
we
saw
used
to
be
observed
in
china
at
this
season
the
chief
performers
in
the
ceremony
are
labourers
who
refrain
from
women
for
seven
days
and
fast
for
three
days
before
the
festival
during
these
days
they
are
taught
in
the
temple
how
to
discharge
the
difficult
and
dangerous
duty
which
is
to
be
laid
upon
them
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
an
enormous
brazier
of
charcoal
sometimes
twenty
feet
wide
is
prepared
in
front
of
the
temple
of
the
great
god
the
protector
of
life
at
sunrise
next
morning
the
brazier
is
lighted
and
kept
burning
by
fresh
supplies
of
fuel
a
taoist
priest
throws
a
mixture
of
salt
and
rice
on
the
fire
to
conjure
the
flames
and
ensure
an
abundant
year
further
two
exorcists
barefooted
and
followed
by
two
peasants
traverse
the
fire
again
and
again
till
it
is
somewhat
beaten
down
meantime
the
procession
is
forming
in
the
temple
the
image
of
the
god
of
the
temple
is
placed
in
a
resplendent
with
red
paint
and
gilding
and
is
carried
forth
by
a
score
or
more
of
barefooted
peasants
on
the
shafts
of
the
behind
the
image
stands
a
magician
with
a
dagger
stuck
through
the
upper
parts
of
his
arms
and
grasping
in
each
hand
a
great
sword
with
which
he
essays
to
deal
himself
violent
blows
on
the
back
however
the
strokes
as
they
descend
are
mostly
parried
by
peasants
who
walk
behind
him
and
interpose
bamboo
rods
between
his
back
and
the
swords
wild
music
now
strikes
up
and
under
the
excitement
caused
by
its
stirring
strains
the
procession
passes
thrice
across
the
furnace
at
their
third
passage
the
performers
are
followed
by
other
peasants
carrying
the
utensils
of
the
temple
and
the
rustic
mob
electrified
by
the
frenzied
spectacle
falls
in
behind
strange
as
it
may
seem
burns
are
comparatively
rare
inured
from
infancy
to
walking
barefoot
the
peasants
can
step
with
impunity
over
the
glowing
charcoal
provided
they
plant
their
feet
squarely
and
do
not
stumble
for
usage
has
so
hardened
their
soles
that
the
skin
is
converted
into
a
sort
of
leathery
or
horny
substance
which
is
almost
callous
to
heat
but
sometimes
when
they
slip
and
a
hot
coal
touches
the
sides
of
their
feet
or
ankles
they
may
be
seen
to
pull
a
wry
face
and
jump
out
of
the
furnace
amid
the
laughter
of
the
spectators
when
this
part
of
the
ceremony
is
over
the
procession
defiles
round
the
village
and
the
priests
distribute
to
every
family
a
leaf
of
yellow
paper
inscribed
with
a
magic
character
which
is
thereupon
glued
over
the
door
of
the
house
the
peasants
carry
off
the
charred
embers
from
the
furnace
pound
them
to
ashes
and
mix
the
ashes
with
the
fodder
of
their
cattle
believing
that
it
fattens
them
however
the
chinese
government
disapproves
of
these
performances
and
next
morning
a
number
of
the
performers
may
generally
be
seen
in
the
hands
of
the
police
laid
face
downwards
on
the
ground
and
receiving
a
sound
castigation
on
a
part
of
their
person
which
is
probably
more
sensitive
than
the
soles
of
their
feet
in
this
last
festival
the
essential
feature
of
the
ceremony
appears
to
be
the
passage
of
the
image
of
the
deity
across
the
fire
it
may
be
compared
to
the
passage
of
the
straw
effigy
of
kupalo
across
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
russia
as
we
shall
see
presently
such
customs
may
perhaps
be
interpreted
as
magical
rites
designed
to
produce
light
and
warmth
by
subjecting
the
deity
himself
to
the
heat
and
glow
of
the
furnace
and
where
as
at
barsana
priests
or
sorcerers
have
been
accustomed
in
the
discharge
of
their
functions
to
walk
through
or
over
fire
they
have
sometimes
done
so
as
the
living
representatives
or
embodiments
of
deities
spirits
or
other
supernatural
beings
some
confirmation
of
this
view
is
furnished
by
the
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
dosadhs
a
low
indian
caste
in
behar
and
chota
nagpur
on
the
fifth
tenth
and
days
of
three
months
in
the
year
the
priest
walks
over
a
narrow
trench
filled
with
smouldering
wood
ashes
and
is
supposed
thus
to
be
inspired
by
the
tribal
god
rahu
who
becomes
incarnate
in
him
for
a
time
full
of
the
spirit
and
also
it
is
surmised
of
drink
the
man
of
god
then
mounts
a
bamboo
platform
where
he
sings
hymns
and
distributes
to
the
crowd
leaves
of
which
cure
incurable
diseases
and
flowers
which
cause
barren
women
to
become
happy
mothers
the
service
winds
up
with
a
feast
lasting
far
into
the
night
at
which
the
line
that
divides
religious
fervour
from
drunken
revelry
can
not
always
be
drawn
with
absolute
precision
similarly
the
bhuiyas
a
dravidian
tribe
of
mirzapur
worship
their
tribal
hero
bir
by
walking
over
a
short
trench
filled
with
fire
and
they
say
that
the
man
who
is
possessed
by
the
hero
does
not
feel
any
pain
in
the
soles
of
his
feet
ceremonies
of
this
sort
used
to
be
observed
in
most
districts
of
the
madras
presidency
sometimes
in
discharge
of
vows
made
in
time
of
sickness
or
distress
sometimes
periodically
in
honour
of
a
deity
where
the
ceremony
was
observed
periodically
it
generally
occurred
in
march
or
june
which
are
the
months
of
the
vernal
equinox
and
the
summer
solstice
respectively
a
narrow
trench
sometimes
twenty
yards
long
and
half
a
foot
deep
was
filled
with
small
sticks
and
twigs
mostly
of
tamarind
which
were
kindled
and
kept
burning
till
they
sank
into
a
mass
of
glowing
embers
along
this
the
devotees
often
fifty
or
sixty
in
succession
walked
ran
or
leaped
barefoot
in
the
madras
government
instituted
an
enquiry
into
the
custom
but
found
that
it
was
not
attended
by
danger
or
instances
of
injury
sufficient
to
call
for
governmental
interference
the
french
traveller
sonnerat
has
described
how
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
hindoos
celebrated
a
of
this
sort
in
honour
of
the
god
darma
rajah
and
his
wife
drobedé
draupadi
the
festival
lasted
eighteen
days
during
which
all
who
had
vowed
to
take
part
in
it
were
bound
to
fast
to
practise
continence
to
sleep
on
the
ground
without
a
mat
and
to
walk
on
a
furnace
on
the
eighteenth
day
the
images
of
darma
rajah
and
his
spouse
were
carried
in
procession
to
the
furnace
and
the
performers
followed
dancing
their
heads
crowned
with
flowers
and
their
bodies
smeared
with
saffron
the
furnace
consisted
of
a
trench
about
forty
feet
long
filled
with
hot
embers
when
the
images
had
been
carried
thrice
round
it
the
worshippers
walked
over
the
embers
faster
or
slower
according
to
the
degree
of
their
religious
fervour
some
carrying
their
children
in
their
arms
others
brandishing
spears
swords
and
standards
this
part
of
the
ceremony
being
over
the
bystanders
hastened
to
rub
their
foreheads
with
ashes
from
the
furnace
and
to
beg
from
the
performers
the
flowers
which
they
had
worn
in
their
hair
and
such
as
obtained
them
preserved
the
flowers
carefully
the
rite
was
performed
in
honour
of
the
goddess
drobedé
draupadi
the
heroine
of
the
great
indian
epic
the
for
she
married
five
brothers
all
at
once
every
year
she
left
one
of
her
husbands
to
betake
herself
to
another
but
before
doing
so
she
had
to
purify
herself
by
fire
there
was
no
fixed
date
for
the
celebration
of
the
rite
but
it
could
only
be
held
in
one
of
the
first
three
months
of
the
year
in
some
villages
the
ceremony
is
performed
annually
in
others
which
can
not
afford
the
expense
every
year
it
is
observed
either
at
longer
intervals
perhaps
once
in
three
seven
ten
or
twelve
years
or
only
in
special
emergencies
such
as
the
outbreak
of
smallpox
cholera
or
plague
anybody
but
a
pariah
or
other
person
of
very
low
degree
may
take
part
in
the
ceremony
in
fulfilment
of
a
vow
for
example
if
a
man
suffers
from
some
chronic
malady
he
may
vow
to
draupadi
that
should
he
be
healed
of
his
disease
he
will
walk
over
the
fire
at
her
festival
as
a
preparation
for
the
solemnity
he
sleeps
in
the
temple
and
observes
a
fast
the
celebration
of
the
rite
in
any
village
is
believed
to
protect
the
cattle
and
the
crops
and
to
guard
the
inhabitants
from
dangers
of
all
kinds
when
it
is
over
many
people
carry
home
the
holy
ashes
of
the
fire
as
a
talisman
which
will
drive
away
devils
and
demons
the
badagas
an
agricultural
tribe
of
the
neilgherry
hills
in
southern
india
annually
celebrate
a
festival
of
fire
in
various
parts
of
their
country
for
example
at
nidugala
the
festival
is
held
with
much
ceremony
in
the
month
of
january
omens
are
taken
by
boiling
two
pots
of
milk
side
by
side
on
two
hearths
if
the
milk
overflows
uniformly
on
all
sides
the
crops
will
be
abundant
for
all
the
villages
but
if
it
flows
over
on
one
side
only
the
harvest
will
be
good
for
villages
on
that
side
only
the
sacred
fire
is
made
by
friction

vertical
stick
of
being
twirled
by
means
of

in
a
socket
let
into
a
thick
bough
of
with
this
holy
flame
a
heap
of
wood
of
two
sorts
the
and
is
kindled
and
the
hot
embers
are
spread
over
a
about
five
yards
long
and
three
yards
broad
when
all
is
ready
the
priest
ties
bells
on
his
legs
and
approaches
the
carrying
milk
freshly
drawn
from
a
cow
which
has
calved
for
the
first
time
and
also
bearing
flowers
of
or
jasmine
after
doing
obeisance
he
throws
the
flowers
on
the
embers
and
then
pours
some
of
the
milk
over
them
if
the
omens
are
propitious
that
is
if
the
flowers
remain
for
a
few
seconds
unscorched
and
the
milk
does
not
hiss
when
it
falls
on
the
embers
the
priest
walks
boldly
over
the
embers
and
is
followed
by
a
crowd
of
celebrants
who
before
they
submit
to
the
ordeal
count
the
hairs
on
their
feet
if
any
of
the
hairs
are
found
to
be
singed
after
the
passage
through
the
it
is
an
ill
omen
sometimes
the
badagas
drive
their
cattle
which
have
recovered
from
sickness
over
the
hot
embers
in
performance
of
a
vow
at
melur
another
place
of
the
badagas
in
the
neilgherry
hills
three
five
or
seven
men
are
chosen
to
walk
through
the
fire
at
the
festival
and
before
they
perform
the
ceremony
they
pour
into
an
adjacent
stream
milk
from
cows
which
have
calved
for
the
first
time
during
the
year
a
general
feast
follows
the
performance
of
the
rite
and
next
day
the
land
is
ploughed
and
sown
for
the
first
time
that
season
at
jakkaneri
another
place
of
the
badagas
in
the
neilgherry
hills
the
passage
through
the
fire
at
the
festival
seems
to
have
originally
had
some
connection
with
agricultural
prospects
as
a
young
bull
is
made
to
go
partly
across
the
before
the
other
devotees
and
the
owners
of
young
cows
which
have
had
their
first
calves
during
the
year
take
precedence
of
others
in
the
ceremony
and
bring
offerings
of
milk
which
are
sprinkled
over
the
burning
according
to
another
account
the
ceremony
among
the
badagas
was
performed
every
second
year
at
a
harvest
festival
and
the
performers
were
a
set
of
degenerate
brahmans
called
haruvarus
who
used
to
walk
on
burning
coals
with
bare
feet
pretending
that
the
god
they
worshipped
could
allay
the
heat
and
make
fire
like
cold
water
to
them
as
they
only
remained
a
few
seconds
however
on
the
coals
it
was
impossible
that
they
could
receive
much
in
japan
the
is
performed
as
a
religious
rite
twice
a
year
at
a
temple
in
the
kanda
quarter
of
tokio
one
of
the
performances
takes
place
in
september
it
was
witnessed
in
the
year
by
the
wife
of
an
american
naval
officer
who
has
described
it
in
a
court
of
the
temple
a
bed
of
charcoal
about
six
yards
long
two
yards
wide
and
two
feet
deep
was
laid
down
and
covered
with
a
deep
layer
of
straw
being
ignited
the
straw
blazed
up
and
when
the
flames
had
died
down
the
bed
of
hot
charcoal
was
fanned
by
attendants
into
a
red
glow
priests
dressed
in
robes
of
white
cotton
then
walked
round
the
fire
striking
sparks
from
flint
and
steel
and
carrying
trays
full
of
salt
when
mats
had
been
laid
down
at
the
two
ends
of
the
fire
and
salt
poured
on
them
the
priests
rubbed
their
bare
feet
twice
in
the
salt
and
then
walked
calmly
down
the
middle
of
the
fire
they
were
followed
by
a
number
of
people
including
some
boys
and
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
the
shintoists
claim
that
having
been
perfectly
purified
by
their
prayers
and
ceremonies
no
evil
has
any
power
over
them
fire
they
regard
as
the
very
spirit
of
evil
so
twice
a
year
i
believe
they
go
through
this
as
a
kind
of
outward
and
visible
sign
of
inward
spiritual
in
the
island
of
mbengga
one
of
the
fijian
archipelago
once
every
year
a
dracaena
which
grows
in
profusion
on
the
grassy
hillsides
becomes
fit
to
yield
the
sugar
of
which
its
fibrous
root
is
full
to
render
the
roots
edible
it
is
necessary
to
bake
them
among
hot
stones
for
four
days
a
great
pit
is
dug
and
filled
with
great
stones
and
blazing
logs
and
when
the
flames
have
died
down
and
the
stones
are
at
white
heat
the
oven
is
ready
to
receive
the
roots
at
this
moment
the
members
of
a
certain
clan
called
na
ivilankata
favoured
of
the
gods
leap
into
the
oven
and
walk
unharmed
upon
the
hot
stones
which
would
scorch
the
feet
of
any
other
persons
on
one
occasion
when
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
by
europeans
fifteen
men
of
the
clan
dressed
in
garlands
and
fringes
walked
unscathed
through
the
furnace
where
tongues
of
fire
played
among
the
hot
stones
the
pit
was
about
nineteen
feet
wide
and
the
men
marched
round
it
planting
their
feet
squarely
and
firmly
on
each
stone
when
they
emerged
from
the
pit
the
feet
of
several
were
examined
and
shewed
no
trace
of
scorching
even
the
anklets
of
dried
leaves
which
they
wore
on
their
legs
were
unburnt
the
immunity
thus
enjoyed
by
members
of
the
clan
in
the
fiery
furnace
is
explained
by
a
legend
that
in
former
days
a
chief
of
the
clan
named
tui
nkualita
received
for
himself
and
his
descendants
this
remarkable
privilege
from
a
certain
god
whom
the
chief
had
accidentally
dragged
out
of
a
deep
pool
of
water
by
the
hair
of
his
head
a
similar
ceremony
of
walking
through
fire
or
rather
over
a
furnace
of
hot
charcoal
or
hot
stones
has
also
been
observed
in
tahiti
the
marquesas
islands
and
by
hindoo
coolies
in
the
west
indian
island
of
trinidad
but
the
who
have
described
the
rite
as
it
is
observed
in
these
islands
have
said
little
or
nothing
as
to
its
meaning
and
purpose
their
whole
attention
having
been
apparently
concentrated
on
the
heat
of
the
furnace
and
the
state
of
the
performers
legs
before
and
after
passing
through
it
another
grand
custom
of
the
hottentots
which
they
likewise
term
is
the
driving
their
sheep
at
certain
times
through
the
fire
early
in
the
day
appointed
by
a
kraal
for
the
observance
of
this
custom
the
women
milk
all
their
cows
and
set
the
whole
produce
before
their
husbands
tis
a
strict
rule
at
those
times
that
the
women
neither
taste
nor
suffer
their
children
to
touch
a
drop
of
it
the
whole
quantity
is
sacred
to
the
men
who
drink
it
all
up
before
they
address
themselves
to
the
business
of
the
fire
having
consumed
the
milk
some
go
and
bring
the
sheep
together
to
the
place
where
the
fire
is
to
be
lighted
while
others
repair
to
the
place
to
light
it
the
fire
is
made
of
chips
and
dry
twigs
and
thinly
spread
into
a
long
square
upon
the
coming
up
of
the
sheep
the
fire
scattered
into
this
figure
is
covered
with
green
twigs
to
raise
a
great
smoak
and
a
number
of
men
range
themselves
closely
on
both
sides
of
it
making
a
lane
for
the
sheep
to
pass
through
and
extending
themselves
to
a
good
distance
beyond
the
fire
on
the
side
where
the
sheep
are
to
enter
things
being
in
this
posture
the
sheep
are
driven
into
the
lane
close
up
to
the
fire
which
now
smoaks
in
the
thickest
clouds
the
foremost
boggle
and
being
forced
forward
by
the
press
behind
seek
their
escape
by
attempting
breaches
in
the
ranks
the
men
stand
close
and
firm
and
whoop
and
goad
them
forward
when
a
few
hands
planted
at
the
front
of
the
fire
catch
three
or
four
of
the
foremost
sheep
by
the
head
and
drag
them
through
and
bring
them
round
into
the
sight
of
the
rest
which
sometimes
upon
this
the
whooping
and
goading
continuing
follow
with
a
tantivy
jumping
and
pouring
themselves
through
the
fire
and
smoak
with
a
mighty
clattering
and
fury
at
other
times
they
are
not
so
tractable
but
put
the
hottentots
to
the
trouble
of
dragging
numbers
of
them
through
and
sometimes
in
a
great
press
and
fright
sturdily
attacking
the
ranks
they
make
a
breach
and
escape
this
is
a
very
mortifying
event
at
all
times
the
hottentots
upon
whatever
account
looking
upon
it
as
a
heavy
disgrace
and
a
very
ill
omen
into
the
bargain
but
when
their
labours
here
are
attended
with
such
success
that
the
sheep
pass
readily
through
or
over
the
fire
tis
hardly
in
the
power
of
language
to
describe
them
in
all
the
sallies
of
their
the
writer
who
thus
describes
the
custom
had
great
difficulty
in
extracting
an
explanation
of
it
from
the
hottentots
at
last
one
of
them
informed
him
that
their
country
was
much
infested
by
wild
dogs
which
made
terrible
havoc
among
the
cattle
worrying
the
animals
to
death
even
when
they
did
not
devour
them
now
we
have
it
he
said
from
our
ancestors
that
if
sheep
are
driven
through
the
fire
as
we
say
that
is
through
a
thick
smoak
the
wild
dogs
will
not
be
fond
of
attacking
them
while
the
scent
of
the
smoak
remains
upon
their
fleeces
we
therefore
from
time
to
time
for
the
security
of
our
flocks
perform
this
when
disease
breaks
out
in
a
herd
of
the
nandi
a
pastoral
tribe
of
british
east
africa
a
large
bonfire
is
made
with
the
wood
of
a
certain
tree
and
brushwood
of
two
sorts
of
shrubs
is
thrown
on
the
top
then
the
sick
herd
is
driven
to
the
fire
and
while
the
animals
are
standing
near
it
a
sheep
big
with
young
is
brought
to
them
and
anointed
with
milk
by
an
elder
after
which
it
is
strangled
by
two
men
belonging
to
clans
that
may
intermarry
the
intestines
are
then
inspected
and
if
the
omens
prove
favourable
the
meat
is
roasted
and
eaten
moreover
rings
are
made
out
of
the
skin
and
worn
by
the
after
the
meat
has
been
eaten
the
herd
is
driven
round
the
fire
and
milk
is
poured
on
each
beast
when
their
cattle
are
sick
the
zulus
of
natal
will
collect
their
herds
in
a
kraal
where
a
kindles
a
fire
burns
medicine
in
it
and
so
fumigates
the
cattle
with
the
medicated
smoke
afterwards
he
sprinkles
the
herd
with
a
decoction
and
taking
some
melted
fat
of
the
dead
oxen
in
his
mouth
squirts
it
on
a
and
holds
the
brand
to
each
animal
in
succession
such
a
custom
is
probably
equivalent
to
the
hottentot
and
european
practice
of
driving
cattle
through
a
fire
among
the
indians
of
yucatan
the
year
which
was
marked
in
their
calendar
by
the
sign
of
was
reputed
to
be
very
unlucky
they
thought
that
in
the
course
of
it
the
would
be
high
the
maize
crops
would
be
withered
up
by
the
extreme
heat
of
the
sun
and
what
remained
of
the
harvest
would
be
devoured
by
swarms
of
ants
and
birds
to
avert
these
calamities
they
used
to
erect
a
great
pyre
of
wood
to
which
most
persons
contributed
a
faggot
having
danced
about
it
during
the
day
they
set
fire
to
it
at
and
when
the
flames
had
died
down
they
spread
out
the
red
embers
and
walked
or
ran
barefoot
over
them
some
of
them
escaping
unsmirched
by
the
flames
but
others
burning
themselves
more
or
less
severely
in
this
way
they
hoped
to
conjure
away
the
evils
that
threatened
them
and
to
undo
the
sinister
omens
of
the
year
similar
rites
were
performed
at
more
than
one
place
in
classical
antiquity
at
castabala
in
cappadocia
the
priestesses
of
an
asiatic
goddess
whom
the
greeks
called
artemis
perasia
used
to
walk
barefoot
through
a
furnace
of
hot
charcoal
and
take
no
harm
again
at
the
foot
of
mount
soracte
in
italy
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
a
goddess
feronia
where
once
a
year
the
men
of
certain
families
walked
barefoot
but
unscathed
over
the
glowing
embers
and
ashes
of
a
great
fire
of
pinewood
in
presence
of
a
vast
multitude
who
had
assembled
from
all
the
country
round
about
to
pay
their
devotions
to
the
deity
or
to
ply
their
business
at
the
fair
the
families
from
whom
the
performers
of
the
rite
were
drawn
went
by
the
name
of
hirpi
sorani
or
soranian
wolves
and
in
consideration
of
the
services
which
they
rendered
the
state
by
walking
through
the
fire
they
were
exempted
by
a
special
decree
of
the
senate
from
military
service
and
all
public
burdens
in
the
discharge
of
their
sacred
function
if
we
can
trust
the
testimony
of
strabo
they
were
believed
to
be
inspired
by
the
goddess
feronia
the
ceremony
certainly
took
place
in
her
sanctuary
which
was
held
in
the
highest
reverence
alike
by
latins
and
sabines
but
according
to
virgil
and
pliny
the
rite
was
performed
in
honour
of
the
god
of
the
mountain
whom
they
call
by
the
greek
name
of
apollo
but
whose
real
name
appears
to
have
been
soranus
if
soranus
was
a
as
his
name
has
by
some
been
thought
to
indicate
we
might
perhaps
conclude
that
the
passage
of
his
priests
through
the
fire
was
a
magical
ceremony
designed
to
procure
a
due
supply
of
light
and
warmth
for
the
earth
by
mimicking
the
sun
s
passage
across
the
firmament
for
so
priceless
a
service
rendered
at
some
personal
risk
it
would
be
natural
that
the
magicians
should
be
handsomely
rewarded
by
a
grateful
country
and
that
they
should
be
released
from
the
common
obligations
of
earth
in
order
the
better
to
devote
themselves
to
their
celestial
mission
the
neighbouring
towns
paid
the
of
their
harvest
as
tribute
to
the
shrine
and
loaded
it
besides
with
offerings
of
gold
and
silver
of
which
however
it
was
swept
clean
by
hannibal
when
he
hung
with
his
dusky
army
like
a
about
to
break
within
sight
of
the
sentinels
on
the
walls
of
rome
the
meaning
of
the
the
foregoing
customs
observed
in
many
different
parts
of
the
world
present
at
least
a
superficial
resemblance
to
the
modern
european
practices
of
leaping
over
fires
and
driving
cattle
through
them
and
we
naturally
ask
whether
it
is
not
possible
to
discover
a
general
explanation
which
will
include
them
all
we
have
seen
that
two
general
theories
have
been
proposed
to
account
for
the
european
practices
according
to
one
theory
the
customs
in
question
are
according
to
the
other
they
are
purifications
let
us
see
how
the
two
rival
theories
fit
the
other
facts
which
we
have
just
passed
in
review
to
take
the
solar
theory
first
it
is
supported
first
by
a
statement
that
the
fires
at
the
pongol
festival
in
southern
india
are
intended
to
wake
the
or
the
from
his
sleep
and
second
by
the
etymology
which
connects
soranus
the
god
of
soracte
with
the
sun
but
for
reasons
which
have
already
been
given
neither
of
these
arguments
carries
much
weight
and
apart
from
them
there
appears
to
be
nothing
in
the
foregoing
customs
to
suggest
that
they
are
nay
some
of
the
customs
appear
hardly
reconcilable
with
such
a
view
for
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
is
frequently
practised
in
india
and
other
tropical
countries
where
as
a
rule
people
would
more
naturally
wish
to
abate
than
to
increase
the
fierce
heat
of
the
sun
in
yucatan
certainly
the
intention
of
kindling
the
bonfires
can
not
possibly
have
been
to
fan
the
solar
flames
since
one
of
the
principal
evils
which
the
bonfires
were
designed
to
remedy
was
precisely
the
excessive
heat
of
the
sun
which
had
withered
up
the
maize
crops
thus
the
solar
theory
is
not
strongly
supported
by
any
of
the
facts
which
we
are
considering
and
it
is
actually
inconsistent
with
some
of
them
not
so
with
the
purificatory
theory
it
is
obviously
applicable
to
some
of
the
facts
and
apparently
consistent
with
them
all
thus
we
have
seen
that
sick
men
make
a
vow
to
walk
over
the
fire
and
that
sick
cattle
are
driven
over
it
in
such
cases
clearly
the
intention
is
to
cleanse
the
suffering
man
or
beast
from
the
infection
of
disease
and
thereby
to
restore
him
or
it
to
health
and
the
fire
is
supposed
to
effect
this
salutary
end
either
by
burning
up
the
powers
of
evil
or
by
interposing
an
insurmountable
barrier
between
them
and
the
sufferer
for
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
evils
which
civilized
men
regard
as
impersonal
are
often
conceived
by
uncivilized
man
in
the
personal
shape
of
witches
and
wizards
of
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
so
that
measures
which
we
should
consider
as
simple
disinfectants
the
savage
looks
upon
as
obstacles
opportunely
presented
to
the
attacks
of
demons
or
other
uncanny
beings
now
of
all
such
obstacles
fire
seems
generally
to
be
thought
the
most
effective
hence
in
passing
through
or
leaping
over
it
our
primitive
philosopher
often
imagines
that
he
is
not
so
much
annihilating
his
spiritual
foe
as
merely
giving
him
the
slip
the
ghostly
pursuer
shrinks
back
appalled
at
the
flames
through
which
his
intended
victim
driven
to
desperation
by
his
fears
has
safely
passed
before
him
this
interpretation
of
the
ceremony
is
confirmed
first
by
the
observation
that
in
india
the
ashes
of
the
bonfire
are
used
as
a
talisman
against
devils
and
demons
and
second
by
the
employment
of
the
ceremony
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
escaping
from
the
pursuit
of
a
troublesome
ghost
for
example
in
china
they
believe
that
a
beheaded
man
wanders
about
a
headless
spectre
in
the
world
of
shades
such
spectres
are
frequently
to
be
seen
in
walled
towns
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
places
of
execution
here
they
often
visit
the
people
with
disease
and
disaster
causing
a
considerable
depreciation
in
the
value
of
the
houses
around
such
scenes
whenever
an
execution
takes
place
the
people
fire
crackers
to
frighten
the
headless
ghost
away
from
the
spot
and
the
mandarin
who
has
superintended
the
bloody
work
on
entering
the
gate
of
his
mansion
has
himself
carried
in
his
sedan
chair
over
a
fire
lighted
on
the
pavement
lest
the
headless
apparition
should
enter
there
along
with
him
for
disembodied
spirits
are
afraid
of
for
a
like
reason
chinese
mourners
after
a
funeral
and
persons
who
have
paid
a
visit
of
condolence
to
a
house
of
death
often
purify
themselves
by
stepping
over
a
fire
of
straw
the
purification
we
can
not
doubt
consists
simply
in
shaking
off
the
ghost
who
is
supposed
to
dog
their
steps
similarly
at
a
coroner
s
inquest
in
china
the
mandarin
and
his
subordinates
hold
pocket
handkerchiefs
or
towels
to
their
mouths
and
noses
while
they
are
inspecting
the
corpse
no
doubt
to
hinder
the
ghost
from
insinuating
himself
into
their
bodies
by
these
apertures
and
when
they
have
discharged
their
dangerous
duty
they
purify
themselves
by
passing
through
a
small
fire
of
straw
kindled
on
the
pavement
before
they
enter
their
to
return
home
while
at
the
same
time
the
crowd
of
idlers
who
have
gathered
about
the
door
assist
in
keeping
the
ghost
at
bay
by
a
liberal
discharge
of
crackers
the
same
double
process
of
purification
or
rather
of
repelling
the
ghost
by
means
of
fire
and
crackers
is
repeated
at
the
gate
of
the
mandarin
s
residence
when
the
procession
defiles
into
it
among
some
of
the
tartars
it
used
to
be
customary
for
all
persons
returning
from
a
burial
to
leap
over
a
fire
made
for
the
purpose
in
order
that
the
dead
man
might
not
follow
them
for
apparently
in
their
opinion
he
would
be
afraid
of
the
the
yakuts
bury
their
dead
as
a
rule
on
the
day
of
the
death
and
in
order
not
to
take
the
demon
of
death
home
with
them
they
kindle
fires
on
the
way
back
from
the
burial
and
jump
over
them
in
the
belief
that
the
demon
of
death
who
dreads
fire
will
not
follow
them
and
that
in
this
way
they
will
be
freed
from
the
persecutions
of
the
hated
demon
of
in
sikkhim
when
members
of
the
khambu
caste
have
buried
a
corpse
all
persons
present
at
the
burial
adjourn
to
a
stream
for
a
bath
of
purification
and
on
the
house
have
to
tread
on
a
bit
of
burning
cloth
to
prevent
the
evil
spirits
who
attend
at
funerals
from
following
them
among
the
fans
of
west
africa
when
the
mourning
is
over
the
wives
of
the
deceased
must
pass
over
a
small
lighted
brazier
in
the
middle
of
the
village
then
they
sit
down
while
some
leaves
are
still
burning
under
their
feet
their
heads
are
shaved
and
from
that
moment
they
are
purified
from
the
we
should
translate
delivered
from
the
ghost
of
their
husband
may
be
divided
among
the
at
agweh
on
the
slave
coast
of
west
africa
a
widow
used
to
remain
shut
up
for
six
months
in
the
room
where
her
husband
was
buried
at
the
end
of
the
time
a
fire
was
lighted
on
the
floor
and
red
peppers
strewn
in
it
until
in
the
pungent
fumes
the
widow
was
nearly
stifled
no
doubt
the
intention
was
to
rid
her
of
her
husband
s
ghost
in
order
that
she
might
mingle
again
in
the
world
with
safety
to
herself
and
others
on
the
analogy
of
these
customs
in
which
the
purpose
of
the
passage
through
the
fire
appears
to
be
unmistakable
we
may
suppose
that
the
motive
of
the
rite
is
similar
at
the
popular
festivals
of
europe
and
the
like
observances
in
other
lands
in
every
case
the
ritual
appears
to
be
explained
in
a
simple
and
natural
way
by
the
supposition
that
the
performers
believe
themselves
to
be
freed
from
certain
evils
actual
or
threatened
through
the
beneficent
agency
of
fire
which
either
burns
up
and
destroys
the
noxious
things
or
at
all
events
repels
and
keeps
them
at
bay
indeed
this
belief
or
at
least
this
hope
is
definitely
expressed
by
some
of
the
people
who
leap
across
the
bonfires
they
imagine
that
all
ills
are
burnt
up
and
consumed
in
the
flames
or
that
they
leave
their
sins
or
at
all
events
their
fleas
behind
them
on
the
far
side
of
the
fire
but
we
may
conjecture
that
originally
all
the
evils
from
which
the
people
thus
thought
to
deliver
themselves
were
conceived
by
them
to
be
caused
by
personal
beings
such
as
ghosts
and
demons
or
witches
and
warlocks
and
that
the
fires
were
kindled
for
the
sole
purpose
of
burning
or
banning
these
noxious
creatures
of
these
evil
powers
witches
and
warlocks
appear
to
have
been
the
most
dreaded
by
our
european
peasantry
and
it
is
therefore
significant
that
the
fires
kindled
on
these
occasions
are
often
expressly
alleged
to
burn
the
witches
that
effigies
of
witches
are
not
uncommonly
consumed
in
them
and
that
two
of
the
great
periodic
of
the
year
namely
may
day
and
midsummer
eve
coincide
with
the
seasons
when
witches
are
believed
to
be
most
active
and
mischievous
and
when
accordingly
many
other
precautions
are
taken
against
them
thus
if
witchcraft
as
a
great
part
of
mankind
has
believed
is
the
fertile
source
of
almost
all
the
calamities
that
afflict
our
species
and
if
the
surest
means
of
frustrating
witchcraft
is
fire
then
it
follows
as
clearly
as
day
follows
night
that
to
jump
over
a
fire
must
be
a
sovereign
panacea
for
practically
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
we
can
now
perhaps
fully
understand
why
festivals
of
fire
played
so
prominent
a
part
in
the
religion
or
superstition
of
our
heathen
forefathers
the
observance
of
such
festivals
flowed
directly
from
their
overmastering
fear
of
witchcraft
and
from
their
theory
as
to
the
best
way
of
combating
that
dreadful
evil
chapter
vii
the
burning
of
human
beings
in
the
fires
the
burning
of
effigies
in
the
fires
we
have
still
to
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
burning
effigies
in
the
fire
at
these
festivals
after
the
preceding
investigation
the
answer
to
the
question
seems
obvious
as
the
fires
are
often
alleged
to
be
kindled
for
the
purpose
of
burning
the
witches
and
as
the
effigy
burnt
in
them
is
sometimes
called
the
witch
we
might
naturally
be
disposed
to
conclude
that
all
the
effigies
consumed
in
the
flames
on
these
occasions
represent
witches
or
warlocks
and
that
the
custom
of
burning
them
is
merely
a
substitute
for
burning
the
wicked
men
and
women
themselves
since
on
the
principle
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
you
practically
destroy
the
witch
herself
in
destroying
her
effigy
on
the
whole
this
explanation
of
the
burning
of
straw
figures
in
human
shape
at
the
festivals
appears
to
be
the
most
probable
yet
it
may
be
that
this
explanation
does
not
apply
to
all
the
cases
and
that
certain
of
them
may
admit
and
even
require
another
interpretation
in
favour
of
which
i
formerly
argued
as
follows
it
remains
to
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
burning
an
effigy
in
these
bonfires
the
effigies
so
burned
as
i
have
already
remarked
can
hardly
be
separated
from
the
effigies
of
death
which
are
burned
or
otherwise
destroyed
in
spring
and
grounds
have
been
already
given
for
regarding
the
effigies
of
death
as
really
representatives
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
are
the
other
effigies
which
are
burned
in
the
spring
and
midsummer
bonfires
susceptible
of
the
same
explanation
it
would
seem
so
for
just
as
the
fragments
of
the
death
are
stuck
in
the
fields
to
make
the
crops
grow
so
the
charred
embers
of
the
figure
burned
in
the
spring
bonfires
are
sometimes
laid
on
the
fields
in
the
belief
that
they
will
keep
vermin
from
the
crop
again
the
rule
that
the
last
married
bride
must
leap
over
the
fire
in
which
the
is
burned
on
shrove
tuesday
is
probably
intended
to
make
her
fruitful
but
as
we
have
seen
the
power
of
blessing
women
with
offspring
is
a
special
attribute
of
it
is
therefore
a
fair
presumption
that
the
burning
effigy
over
which
the
bride
must
leap
is
a
representative
of
the
fertilizing
or
spirit
of
vegetation
this
character
of
the
effigy
as
representative
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
is
almost
unmistakable
when
the
figure
is
composed
of
an
unthreshed
sheaf
of
corn
or
is
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
flowers
again
it
is
to
be
noted
that
instead
of
a
puppet
trees
either
living
or
felled
are
sometimes
burned
both
in
the
spring
and
midsummer
bonfires
now
considering
the
frequency
with
which
the
is
represented
in
human
shape
it
is
hardly
rash
to
suppose
that
when
sometimes
a
tree
and
sometimes
an
effigy
is
burned
in
these
fires
the
effigy
and
the
tree
are
regarded
as
equivalent
to
each
other
each
being
a
representative
of
the
this
again
is
confirmed
by
observing
first
that
sometimes
the
effigy
which
is
to
be
burned
is
carried
about
simultaneously
with
a
the
former
being
carried
by
the
boys
the
latter
by
the
girls
and
second
that
the
effigy
is
sometimes
tied
to
a
living
tree
and
burned
with
it
in
these
cases
we
can
scarcely
doubt
the
is
represented
as
we
have
found
it
represented
before
in
duplicate
both
by
the
tree
and
by
the
effigy
that
the
true
character
of
the
effigy
as
a
representative
of
the
beneficent
spirit
of
vegetation
should
sometimes
be
forgotten
is
natural
the
custom
of
burning
a
beneficent
god
is
too
foreign
to
later
modes
of
thought
to
escape
misinterpretation
naturally
enough
the
people
who
continued
to
burn
his
image
came
in
time
to
identify
it
as
the
effigy
of
persons
whom
on
various
grounds
they
regarded
with
aversion
such
as
judas
iscariot
luther
and
a
witch
the
general
reasons
for
killing
a
god
or
his
representative
have
been
examined
in
the
preceding
chapter
but
when
the
god
happens
to
be
a
deity
of
vegetation
there
are
special
reasons
why
he
should
die
by
fire
for
light
and
heat
are
necessary
to
vegetable
growth
and
on
the
principle
of
sympathetic
magic
by
subjecting
the
personal
representative
of
vegetation
to
their
influence
you
secure
a
supply
of
these
necessaries
for
trees
and
crops
in
other
words
by
burning
the
spirit
of
vegetation
in
a
fire
which
represents
the
sun
you
make
sure
that
for
a
time
at
least
vegetation
shall
have
plenty
of
sun
it
may
be
objected
that
if
the
intention
is
simply
to
secure
enough
sunshine
for
vegetation
this
end
would
be
better
attained
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
by
merely
passing
the
representative
of
vegetation
through
the
fire
instead
of
burning
him
in
point
of
fact
this
is
sometimes
done
in
russia
as
we
have
seen
the
straw
figure
of
kupalo
is
not
burned
in
the
midsummer
fire
but
merely
carried
backwards
and
forwards
across
it
but
for
the
reasons
already
given
it
is
necessary
that
the
god
should
die
so
next
day
kupalo
is
stripped
of
her
ornaments
and
thrown
into
a
stream
in
this
russian
custom
therefore
the
passage
of
the
image
through
the
fire
is
a
pure
and
simple
the
killing
of
the
god
is
a
separate
act
and
the
mode
of
killing
probably
a
but
usually
people
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
draw
this
fine
distinction
for
the
various
reasons
already
assigned
it
is
advantageous
they
think
to
expose
the
god
of
vegetation
to
a
considerable
degree
of
heat
and
it
is
also
advantageous
to
kill
him
and
they
combine
these
advantages
in
a
way
by
burning
on
the
foregoing
argument
which
i
do
not
now
find
very
cogent
i
would
remark
that
we
must
distinguish
the
cases
in
which
an
effigy
or
an
image
is
burnt
in
the
fire
from
the
cases
in
which
it
is
simply
carried
through
or
over
it
we
have
seen
that
in
the
chinese
festival
of
fire
the
image
of
the
god
is
carried
thrice
by
bearers
over
the
glowing
furnace
here
the
motive
for
subjecting
a
god
to
the
heat
of
the
furnace
must
surely
be
the
same
as
the
motive
for
subjecting
his
worshippers
to
the
same
ordeal
and
if
the
motive
in
the
case
of
the
worshippers
is
purificatory
it
is
probably
the
same
in
the
case
of
the
deity
in
other
words
we
may
suppose
that
the
image
of
a
god
is
periodically
carried
over
a
furnace
in
order
to
purify
him
from
the
taint
of
corruption
the
spells
of
magicians
or
any
other
evil
influences
that
might
impair
or
impede
his
divine
energies
the
same
theory
would
explain
the
custom
of
obliging
the
priest
ceremonially
to
pass
through
the
fire
the
custom
need
not
be
a
mitigation
of
an
older
practice
of
burning
him
in
the
flames
it
may
only
be
a
purification
designed
to
enable
him
the
better
to
discharge
his
sacred
duties
as
representative
of
the
deity
in
the
coming
year
similarly
when
the
rite
is
obligatory
not
on
the
people
as
a
whole
but
only
on
certain
persons
chosen
for
the
purpose
we
may
suppose
that
these
persons
act
as
representatives
of
the
entire
community
which
thus
passes
through
the
fire
by
deputy
and
consequently
participates
in
all
the
benefits
which
are
believed
to
accrue
from
the
purificatory
character
of
the
rite
in
both
cases
therefore
if
my
interpretation
of
them
is
correct
the
passage
over
or
through
a
fire
is
not
a
substitute
for
human
sacrifice
it
is
nothing
but
a
stringent
form
of
purification
the
burning
of
men
and
animals
in
the
fires
yet
in
the
popular
customs
connected
with
the
of
europe
there
are
certain
features
which
appear
to
point
to
a
former
practice
of
human
sacrifice
we
have
seen
reasons
for
believing
that
in
europe
living
persons
have
often
acted
as
representatives
of
the
and
and
have
suffered
death
as
such
there
is
no
reason
therefore
why
they
should
not
have
been
burned
if
any
special
advantages
were
likely
to
be
attained
by
putting
them
to
death
in
that
way
the
consideration
of
human
suffering
is
not
one
which
enters
into
the
calculations
of
primitive
man
now
in
the
which
we
are
discussing
the
pretence
of
burning
people
is
sometimes
carried
so
far
that
it
seems
reasonable
to
regard
it
as
a
mitigated
survival
of
an
older
custom
of
actually
burning
them
thus
in
aachen
as
we
saw
the
man
clad
in
acts
so
cleverly
that
the
children
really
believe
he
is
being
burned
at
jumièges
in
normandy
the
man
clad
all
in
green
who
bore
the
title
of
the
green
wolf
was
pursued
by
his
comrades
and
when
they
caught
him
they
feigned
to
fling
him
upon
the
bonfire
similarly
at
the
beltane
fires
in
scotland
the
pretended
victim
was
seized
and
a
show
made
of
throwing
him
into
the
flames
and
for
some
time
afterwards
people
affected
to
speak
of
him
as
dead
again
in
the
hallowe
en
bonfires
of
scotland
we
may
perhaps
detect
a
similar
pretence
in
the
custom
observed
by
a
lad
of
lying
down
as
close
to
the
fire
as
possible
and
allowing
the
other
lads
to
leap
over
him
the
titular
king
at
aix
who
reigned
for
a
year
and
danced
the
first
dance
round
the
midsummer
bonfire
may
perhaps
in
days
of
old
have
discharged
the
less
agreeable
duty
of
serving
as
fuel
for
that
fire
which
in
later
times
he
only
kindled
in
the
following
customs
mannhardt
is
probably
right
in
recognizing
traces
of
an
old
custom
of
burning
a
representative
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
at
wolfeck
in
austria
on
midsummer
day
a
boy
completely
clad
in
green
fir
branches
goes
from
house
to
house
accompanied
by
a
noisy
crew
collecting
wood
for
the
bonfire
as
he
gets
the
wood
he
trees
i
want
sour
milk
for
me
beer
and
wine
can
the
be
jolly
and
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
also
the
boys
who
go
from
house
to
house
collecting
fuel
for
the
midsummer
bonfire
envelop
one
of
their
number
from
head
to
foot
in
green
branches
of
firs
and
lead
him
by
a
rope
through
the
whole
village
at
moosheim
in
wurtemberg
the
festival
of
john
s
fire
usually
lasted
for
fourteen
days
ending
on
the
second
sunday
after
midsummer
day
on
this
last
day
the
bonfire
was
left
in
charge
of
the
children
while
the
older
people
retired
to
a
wood
here
they
encased
a
young
fellow
in
leaves
and
twigs
who
thus
disguised
went
to
the
fire
scattered
it
and
trod
it
out
all
the
people
present
fled
at
the
sight
of
him
in
this
connexion
it
is
worth
while
to
note
that
in
pagan
europe
the
water
as
well
as
the
fire
seems
to
have
claimed
its
human
victim
on
midsummer
day
some
german
rivers
such
as
the
saale
and
the
spree
are
believed
still
to
require
their
victim
on
that
day
hence
people
are
careful
not
to
bathe
at
this
perilous
season
where
the
beautiful
neckar
flows
between
and
wooded
hills
under
the
majestic
ruins
of
heidelberg
castle
the
spirit
of
the
river
seeks
to
drown
three
persons
one
on
midsummer
eve
one
on
midsummer
day
and
one
on
the
day
after
on
these
nights
if
you
hear
a
shriek
as
of
a
drowning
man
or
woman
from
the
water
beware
of
running
to
the
rescue
for
it
is
only
the
shrieking
to
lure
you
to
your
doom
many
a
fisherman
of
the
elbe
knows
better
than
to
launch
his
boat
and
trust
himself
to
the
treacherous
river
on
midsummer
day
and
samland
fishermen
will
not
go
to
sea
at
this
season
because
they
are
aware
that
the
sea
is
then
hollow
and
demands
a
victim
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
of
constance
the
swabian
peasants
say
that
on
john
s
day
the
angel
or
john
must
have
a
swimmer
and
a
climber
hence
no
one
will
climb
a
tree
or
bathe
even
in
a
brook
on
that
day
according
to
others
john
will
have
three
dead
men
on
his
day
one
of
them
must
die
by
water
one
by
a
fall
and
one
by
lightning
therefore
people
warn
their
children
not
to
climb
or
bathe
and
are
very
careful
themselves
not
to
run
into
any
kind
of
danger
on
midsummer
day
so
in
some
parts
of
switzerland
people
are
warned
against
bathing
on
john
s
night
because
the
saint
s
day
demands
its
victims
thus
in
the
emmenthal
they
say
this
day
will
have
three
persons
one
must
perish
in
the
air
one
in
the
fire
and
the
third
in
the
at
schaffhausen
the
saying
runs
st
john
the
baptist
must
have
a
runner
must
have
a
swimmer
must
have
a
that
is
the
reason
why
you
should
not
climb
on
the
saint
s
day
lest
you
should
fall
down
and
break
your
valuable
neck
in
cologne
the
saint
is
more
exacting
on
his
day
he
requires
no
less
than
fourteen
dead
men
seven
of
them
must
be
swimmers
and
seven
climbers
accordingly
when
we
find
that
in
one
of
the
districts
where
a
belief
of
this
sort
prevails
it
used
to
be
customary
to
throw
a
person
into
the
water
on
midsummer
day
we
can
hardly
help
concluding
that
this
was
only
a
modification
of
an
older
custom
of
actually
drowning
a
human
being
in
the
river
at
that
time
in
voigtland
it
was
formerly
the
practice
to
set
up
a
fine
may
tree
adorned
with
all
kinds
of
things
on
john
s
day
the
people
danced
round
it
and
when
the
lads
had
fetched
down
the
things
with
which
it
was
tricked
out
the
tree
was
thrown
into
the
water
but
before
this
was
done
they
sought
out
somebody
whom
they
treated
in
the
same
manner
and
the
victim
of
this
horseplay
was
called
the
the
brawls
and
disorders
which
such
a
custom
naturally
provoked
led
to
the
suppression
of
the
whole
ceremony
at
rotenburg
on
the
neckar
they
throw
a
loaf
of
bread
into
the
water
on
john
s
day
were
this
offering
not
made
the
river
would
grow
angry
and
take
away
a
man
clearly
therefore
the
loaf
is
regarded
as
a
substitute
which
the
spirit
of
the
river
consents
to
accept
instead
of
a
human
victim
elsewhere
the
is
content
with
flowers
thus
in
bohemia
people
sometimes
cast
garlands
into
water
on
midsummer
eve
and
if
the
pulls
one
of
them
down
it
is
a
sign
that
the
person
who
threw
the
garland
in
will
die
in
the
villages
of
hesse
the
girl
who
first
comes
to
the
well
early
on
the
morning
of
midsummer
day
places
on
the
mouth
of
the
well
a
gay
garland
composed
of
many
sorts
of
flowers
which
she
has
culled
from
the
fields
and
meadows
sometimes
a
number
of
such
garlands
are
twined
together
to
form
a
crown
with
which
the
well
is
decked
at
fulda
in
addition
to
the
flowery
decoration
of
the
wells
the
neighbours
choose
a
lord
of
the
wells
and
announce
his
election
by
sending
him
a
great
nosegay
of
flowers
his
house
too
is
decorated
with
green
boughs
and
children
walk
in
procession
to
it
he
goes
from
house
to
house
collecting
materials
for
a
feast
of
which
the
neighbours
partake
on
the
following
sunday
what
the
other
duties
of
the
lord
of
the
wells
may
be
we
are
not
told
we
may
conjecture
that
in
old
days
he
had
to
see
to
it
that
the
spirits
of
the
water
received
their
dues
from
men
and
maidens
on
that
important
day
the
belief
that
the
spirits
of
the
water
exact
a
human
life
on
midsummer
day
may
partly
explain
why
that
day
is
regarded
by
some
people
as
unlucky
at
neuburg
in
baden
people
who
meet
on
midsummer
day
bid
each
other
beware
sicilian
mothers
on
that
ominous
day
warn
their
little
sons
not
to
go
out
of
the
house
or
if
they
do
go
out
not
to
stray
far
not
to
walk
on
solitary
unfrequented
paths
to
avoid
horses
and
carriages
and
persons
with
firearms
and
not
to
dare
to
swim
in
short
they
bid
them
be
on
their
guard
at
every
turn
the
sicilian
writer
who
tells
us
this
adds
this
i
know
and
sadly
remember
ever
since
the
year
when
not
yet
seven
years
old
i
beheld
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
on
john
s
day
some
women
of
my
acquaintance
bringing
back
in
their
arms
my
little
brother
who
had
gone
to
play
in
a
garden
near
our
house
and
there
had
found
his
death
my
poor
francesco
in
their
simplicity
the
women
who
strove
to
console
my
inconsolable
mother
driven
distracted
by
the
dreadful
blow
kept
repeating
that
john
must
have
his
due
that
on
that
day
he
must
be
appeased
who
knows
said
they
how
many
other
mothers
are
weeping
now
for
other
little
sons
forlorn
yet
curiously
enough
though
the
call
for
human
victims
on
midsummer
eve
or
midsummer
day
water
in
general
is
supposed
at
that
season
to
acquire
certain
wonderful
medicinal
virtues
so
that
he
who
bathes
in
it
then
or
drinks
of
it
is
not
only
healed
of
all
his
infirmities
but
will
be
well
and
hearty
throughout
the
year
hence
in
many
parts
of
europe
from
sweden
in
the
north
to
sicily
in
the
south
and
from
ireland
and
spain
in
the
west
to
esthonia
in
the
east
it
used
to
be
customary
for
men
women
and
children
to
bathe
in
crowds
in
rivers
the
sea
or
springs
on
midsummer
eve
or
midsummer
day
hoping
thus
to
fortify
themselves
for
the
next
twelve
months
the
usual
time
for
taking
the
bath
was
the
night
which
intervenes
between
midsummer
eve
and
midsummer
day
but
in
belgium
the
hour
was
noon
on
midsummer
day
it
was
a
curious
sight
we
are
told
to
see
the
banks
of
a
river
lined
with
naked
children
waiting
for
the
first
stroke
of
noon
to
plunge
into
the
healing
water
the
dip
was
supposed
to
have
a
remarkable
effect
in
strengthening
the
legs
people
who
were
ashamed
to
bathe
in
public
used
to
have
cans
of
water
brought
to
their
houses
from
the
river
at
midday
and
then
performed
their
ablutions
in
the
privacy
of
their
chambers
nor
did
they
throw
away
the
precious
fluid
on
the
contrary
they
bottled
it
up
and
kept
it
as
a
sort
of
elixir
for
use
throughout
the
year
it
was
thought
never
to
grow
foul
and
to
be
as
blessed
as
holy
water
fetched
from
a
church
which
we
may
well
believe
hence
it
served
to
guard
the
house
against
a
when
the
clouds
were
heavy
and
threatening
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
take
the
palm
branches
that
is
the
twigs
of
which
were
blessed
on
palm
sunday
dip
them
in
the
midsummer
water
and
burn
them
that
averted
the
tempest
in
the
swiss
canton
of
lucerne
a
bath
on
midsummer
eve
is
thought
to
be
especially
wholesome
though
in
other
parts
of
switzerland
as
we
saw
bathing
at
that
season
is
accounted
dangerous
nor
are
such
customs
and
beliefs
confined
to
the
christian
peoples
of
europe
they
are
shared
also
by
the
mohammedan
peoples
of
morocco
there
too
on
midsummer
day
all
water
is
thought
to
be
endowed
with
such
marvellous
virtue
that
it
not
only
heals
but
prevents
sickness
for
the
rest
of
the
year
hence
men
women
and
children
bathe
in
the
sea
in
rivers
or
in
their
houses
at
that
time
for
the
sake
of
their
health
in
fez
and
other
places
on
this
day
people
pour
or
squirt
water
over
each
other
in
the
streets
or
from
the
so
that
the
streets
become
almost
as
muddy
as
after
a
fall
of
rain
more
than
that
in
the
andjra
they
bathe
their
animals
also
horses
mules
donkeys
cattle
sheep
and
goats
all
must
participate
in
the
miraculous
benefits
of
midsummer
water
the
rite
forms
part
of
that
old
heathen
celebration
of
midsummer
which
appears
to
have
been
common
to
the
peoples
on
both
sides
of
the
mediterranean
and
as
the
aim
of
bathing
in
the
midsummer
water
is
undoubtedly
purification
it
is
reasonable
to
assign
the
same
motive
for
the
custom
of
leaping
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
on
the
other
hand
some
people
in
morocco
like
some
people
in
europe
think
that
water
on
midsummer
day
is
unclean
or
dangerous
a
berber
told
westermarck
that
water
is
haunted
on
midsummer
day
and
that
people
therefore
avoid
bathing
in
it
and
keep
animals
from
drinking
of
it
and
among
the
beni
ahsen
persons
who
swim
in
the
river
on
that
day
are
careful
before
plunging
into
the
water
to
throw
burning
straw
into
it
as
an
offering
in
order
that
the
spirits
may
not
harm
them
the
parallelism
between
the
rites
of
water
and
fire
at
this
season
is
certainly
in
favour
of
interpreting
both
in
the
same
way
and
the
traces
of
human
sacrifice
which
we
have
detected
in
the
rite
of
water
may
therefore
be
allowed
to
strengthen
the
inference
of
a
similar
sacrifice
in
the
rite
of
fire
but
it
seems
possible
to
go
farther
than
this
of
human
sacrifices
offered
on
these
occasions
the
most
unequivocal
traces
as
we
have
seen
are
those
which
about
a
hundred
years
ago
still
lingered
at
the
beltane
fires
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
that
is
among
a
celtic
people
who
situated
in
a
remote
corner
of
europe
and
almost
completely
isolated
from
foreign
influence
had
till
then
conserved
their
old
heathenism
better
perhaps
than
any
other
people
in
the
west
of
europe
it
is
significant
therefore
that
human
sacrifices
by
fire
are
known
on
unquestionable
evidence
to
have
been
systematically
practised
by
the
celts
the
earliest
description
of
these
sacrifices
has
been
bequeathed
to
us
by
julius
caesar
as
conqueror
of
the
hitherto
independent
celts
of
gaul
caesar
had
ample
opportunity
of
observing
the
national
celtic
religion
and
manners
while
these
were
still
fresh
and
crisp
from
the
native
mint
and
had
not
yet
been
fused
in
the
of
roman
civilization
with
his
own
notes
caesar
appears
to
have
incorporated
the
observations
of
a
greek
explorer
by
name
posidonius
who
travelled
in
gaul
about
fifty
years
before
caesar
carried
the
roman
arms
to
the
english
channel
the
greek
geographer
strabo
and
the
historian
diodorus
seem
also
to
have
derived
their
descriptions
of
the
celtic
sacrifices
from
the
work
of
posidonius
but
independently
of
each
other
and
of
caesar
for
each
of
the
three
derivative
accounts
contain
some
details
which
are
not
to
be
found
in
either
of
the
others
by
combining
them
therefore
we
can
restore
the
original
account
of
posidonius
with
some
probability
and
thus
obtain
a
picture
of
the
sacrifices
offered
by
the
celts
of
gaul
at
the
close
of
the
second
century
before
our
era
the
following
seem
to
have
been
the
main
outlines
of
the
custom
condemned
criminals
were
reserved
by
the
celts
in
order
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
gods
at
a
great
festival
which
took
place
once
in
every
five
years
the
more
there
were
of
such
victims
the
greater
was
believed
to
be
the
fertility
of
the
land
if
there
were
not
enough
criminals
to
furnish
victims
captives
taken
in
war
were
immolated
to
supply
the
deficiency
when
the
time
came
the
victims
were
sacrificed
by
the
druids
or
priests
some
they
shot
down
with
arrows
some
they
impaled
and
some
they
burned
alive
in
the
following
manner
colossal
images
of
or
of
wood
and
grass
were
constructed
these
were
filled
with
live
men
cattle
and
animals
of
other
kinds
fire
was
then
applied
to
the
images
and
they
were
burned
with
their
living
contents
such
were
the
great
festivals
held
once
every
five
years
but
besides
these
quinquennial
festivals
celebrated
on
so
grand
a
scale
and
with
apparently
so
large
an
expenditure
of
human
life
it
seems
reasonable
to
suppose
that
festivals
of
the
same
sort
only
on
a
lesser
scale
were
held
annually
and
that
from
these
annual
festivals
are
lineally
descended
some
at
least
of
the
which
with
their
traces
of
human
sacrifices
are
still
celebrated
year
by
year
in
many
parts
of
europe
the
gigantic
images
constructed
of
osiers
or
covered
with
grass
in
which
the
druids
enclosed
their
victims
remind
us
of
the
leafy
framework
in
which
the
human
representative
of
the
is
still
so
often
encased
hence
seeing
that
the
fertility
of
the
land
was
apparently
supposed
to
depend
upon
the
due
performance
of
these
sacrifices
mannhardt
interpreted
the
celtic
victims
cased
in
osiers
and
grass
as
representatives
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
these
wicker
giants
of
the
druids
seem
to
have
had
till
lately
their
representatives
at
the
spring
and
midsummer
festivals
of
modern
europe
at
douay
down
to
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
procession
took
place
annually
on
the
sunday
nearest
to
the
seventh
of
july
the
great
feature
of
the
procession
was
a
colossal
figure
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
made
of
osiers
and
called
the
giant
which
was
moved
through
the
streets
by
means
of
rollers
and
ropes
worked
by
men
who
were
enclosed
within
the
effigy
the
wooden
head
of
the
giant
is
said
to
have
been
carved
and
painted
by
rubens
the
figure
was
armed
as
a
knight
with
lance
and
sword
helmet
and
shield
behind
him
marched
his
wife
and
his
three
children
all
constructed
of
osiers
on
the
same
principle
but
on
a
smaller
scale
at
dunkirk
the
procession
of
the
giants
took
place
on
midsummer
day
the
of
june
the
festival
which
was
known
as
the
follies
of
dunkirk
attracted
such
multitudes
of
spectators
that
the
inns
and
private
houses
could
not
lodge
them
all
and
many
had
to
sleep
in
cellars
or
in
the
streets
in
an
estimated
that
the
number
of
onlookers
was
not
less
than
forty
thousand
without
counting
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
the
streets
through
which
the
procession
took
its
way
were
lined
with
double
ranks
of
soldiers
and
the
houses
crammed
with
spectators
from
top
to
bottom
high
mass
was
celebrated
in
the
principal
church
and
then
the
procession
got
under
weigh
first
came
the
guilds
or
brotherhoods
the
members
walking
two
and
two
with
great
waxen
tapers
lighted
in
their
hands
they
were
followed
by
the
friars
and
the
secular
priests
and
then
came
the
abbot
magnificently
attired
with
the
host
borne
before
him
by
a
venerable
old
man
when
these
were
past
the
real
follies
of
dunkirk
began
they
consisted
of
pageants
of
various
sorts
wheeled
through
the
streets
in
cars
these
appear
to
have
varied
somewhat
from
year
to
year
but
if
we
may
judge
from
the
processions
of
and
both
of
which
have
been
described
by
a
standing
show
was
a
car
decked
with
foliage
and
branches
to
imitate
a
wood
and
carrying
a
number
of
men
dressed
in
leaves
or
in
green
scaly
skins
who
squirted
water
on
the
people
from
pewter
syringes
an
english
spectator
has
compared
these
maskers
to
the
green
men
of
our
own
country
on
may
day
last
of
all
came
the
giant
and
giantess
the
giant
was
a
huge
figure
of
occasionally
as
much
as
feet
high
dressed
in
a
long
blue
robe
with
gold
stripes
which
reached
to
his
feet
concealing
the
dozen
or
more
men
who
made
it
dance
and
bob
its
head
to
the
spectators
this
colossal
effigy
went
by
the
name
of
papa
reuss
and
carried
in
its
pocket
a
bouncing
infant
of
brobdingnagian
proportions
who
kept
bawling
papa
papa
in
a
voice
of
thunder
only
pausing
from
time
to
time
to
devour
the
victuals
which
were
handed
out
to
him
from
the
windows
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
the
daughter
of
the
giant
constructed
like
her
sire
of
and
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
him
in
size
she
wore
a
robe
with
a
gold
watch
as
large
as
a
warming
pan
at
her
side
her
breast
glittered
with
jewels
her
complexion
was
high
and
her
eyes
and
head
turned
with
as
easy
a
grace
as
the
men
inside
could
contrive
to
impart
to
their
motions
the
procession
came
to
an
end
with
the
revolution
of
and
has
never
been
revived
the
giant
himself
indeed
who
had
won
the
affections
of
the
townspeople
survived
his
ancient
glory
for
a
little
while
and
made
shift
to
appear
in
public
a
few
times
more
at
the
carnival
and
other
festal
occasions
but
his
days
were
numbered
and
within
fifty
years
even
his
memory
had
seemingly
perished
most
towns
and
even
villages
of
brabant
and
flanders
have
or
used
to
have
similar
wicker
giants
which
were
annually
led
about
to
the
delight
of
the
populace
who
loved
these
grotesque
figures
spoke
of
them
with
patriotic
enthusiasm
and
never
wearied
of
gazing
at
them
the
name
by
which
the
giants
went
was
reuzes
and
a
special
song
called
the
reuze
song
was
sung
in
the
flemish
dialect
while
they
were
making
their
triumphal
progress
through
the
streets
the
most
celebrated
of
these
monstrous
effigies
were
those
of
antwerp
and
wetteren
at
ypres
a
whole
family
of
giants
contributed
to
the
public
hilarity
at
the
carnival
at
cassel
and
hazebrouch
in
the
french
department
of
nord
the
giants
made
their
annual
appearance
on
shrove
tuesday
at
antwerp
the
giant
was
so
big
that
no
gate
in
the
city
was
large
enough
to
let
him
go
through
hence
he
could
not
visit
his
brother
giants
in
neighbouring
towns
as
the
other
belgian
giants
used
to
do
on
solemn
occasions
he
was
designed
in
by
peter
van
aelst
painter
to
the
emperor
charles
the
fifth
and
is
still
preserved
with
other
colossal
figures
in
a
large
hall
at
antwerp
at
ath
in
the
belgian
province
of
hainaut
the
popular
procession
of
the
giants
took
place
annually
in
august
down
to
the
year
at
least
for
three
days
the
colossal
effigies
of
goliath
and
his
wife
of
samson
and
an
archer
together
with
a
eagle
were
led
about
the
streets
on
the
shoulders
of
twenty
bearers
concealed
under
the
flowing
drapery
of
the
giants
to
the
great
delight
of
the
townspeople
and
a
crowd
of
strangers
who
assembled
to
witness
the
pageant
the
custom
can
be
traced
back
by
documentary
evidence
to
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
but
it
appears
that
the
practice
of
giving
goliath
a
wife
dates
only
from
the
year
their
nuptials
were
solemnized
every
year
on
the
eve
of
the
festival
in
the
church
of
julien
whither
the
two
huge
figures
were
escorted
by
the
magistrates
in
procession
in
england
artificial
giants
seem
to
have
been
a
standing
feature
of
the
midsummer
festival
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
speaks
of
midsommer
pageants
in
london
where
to
make
the
people
wonder
are
set
forth
great
and
uglie
gyants
marching
as
if
they
were
alive
and
armed
at
all
points
but
within
they
are
stuffed
full
of
browne
paper
and
tow
which
the
shrewd
boyes
underpeering
do
guilefully
discover
and
turne
to
a
greate
at
chester
the
annual
pageant
on
midsummer
eve
included
the
effigies
of
four
giants
with
animals
and
other
figures
an
officious
mayor
of
the
town
suppressed
the
giants
in
but
they
were
restored
by
another
mayor
in
under
the
commonwealth
the
pageant
was
discontinued
and
the
giants
and
beasts
were
destroyed
but
after
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
the
old
ceremony
was
revived
on
the
old
date
new
effigies
being
constructed
to
replace
those
which
had
fallen
victims
to
roundhead
bigotry
the
accounts
preserve
a
record
not
only
of
the
hoops
buckram
tinfoil
gold
and
silver
leaf
paint
glue
and
paste
which
went
to
make
up
these
gorgeous
figures
they
also
mention
the
arsenic
which
was
mixed
with
the
paste
in
order
to
preserve
the
poor
giants
from
being
eaten
alive
by
the
rats
at
coventry
the
accounts
of
the
cappers
and
drapers
companies
in
the
sixteenth
century
shed
light
on
the
giants
which
there
also
were
carried
about
the
town
at
midsummer
from
some
of
the
entries
it
appears
that
the
giant
s
wife
figured
beside
the
giant
at
burford
in
oxfordshire
midsummer
eve
used
to
be
celebrated
with
great
jollity
by
the
carrying
of
a
giant
and
a
dragon
up
and
down
the
town
the
last
survivor
of
these
perambulating
english
giants
dragged
out
a
miserable
existence
at
salisbury
where
an
antiquary
found
him
mouldering
to
decay
in
the
neglected
hall
of
the
tailors
company
about
the
year
his
bodily
framework
was
of
lath
and
hoop
like
the
one
which
used
to
be
worn
by
on
may
day
the
drapery
which
concealed
the
bearer
was
of
coloured
chintz
bordered
with
red
and
purple
and
trimmed
with
yellow
fringe
his
head
was
modelled
in
and
adorned
with
a
cocked
hat
his
flowing
locks
were
of
tow
and
in
his
big
right
hand
he
brandished
a
branch
of
artificial
laurel
in
the
days
of
his
glory
he
promenaded
about
the
streets
dancing
clumsily
and
attended
by
two
men
grotesquely
attired
who
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
his
movements
and
checked
by
the
wooden
sword
and
club
which
they
carried
any
incipient
tendency
to
lose
his
balance
and
topple
over
in
an
undignified
manner
which
would
have
exposed
to
the
derision
of
the
populace
the
mystery
of
his
inner
man
the
learned
called
him
christopher
the
vulgar
simply
the
giant
in
these
cases
the
giants
only
figure
in
the
processions
but
sometimes
they
were
burned
in
the
summer
bonfires
thus
the
people
of
the
rue
aux
ours
in
paris
used
annually
to
make
a
great
figure
dressed
as
a
soldier
which
they
promenaded
up
and
down
the
streets
for
several
days
and
solemnly
burned
on
the
third
of
july
the
crowd
of
spectators
singing
a
personage
who
bore
the
title
of
king
presided
over
the
ceremony
with
a
lighted
torch
in
his
hand
the
burning
fragments
of
the
image
were
scattered
among
the
people
who
eagerly
scrambled
for
them
the
custom
was
abolished
in
in
brie
isle
de
france
a
giant
eighteen
feet
high
was
annually
burned
on
midsummer
eve
again
the
druidical
custom
of
burning
live
animals
enclosed
in
has
its
counterpart
at
the
spring
and
midsummer
festivals
at
luchon
in
the
pyrenees
on
midsummer
eve
a
hollow
column
composed
of
strong
is
raised
to
the
height
of
about
sixty
feet
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
suburb
and
interlaced
with
green
foliage
up
to
the
very
top
while
the
most
beautiful
flowers
and
shrubs
procurable
are
artistically
arranged
in
groups
below
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
background
to
the
scene
the
column
is
then
filled
with
combustible
materials
ready
for
ignition
at
an
appointed
grand
procession
composed
of
the
clergy
followed
by
young
men
and
maidens
in
holiday
attire
pour
forth
from
the
town
chanting
hymns
and
take
up
their
position
around
the
column
meanwhile
bonfires
are
lit
with
beautiful
effect
in
the
surrounding
hills
as
many
living
serpents
as
could
be
collected
are
now
thrown
into
the
column
which
is
set
on
fire
at
the
base
by
means
of
torches
armed
with
which
about
fifty
boys
and
men
dance
around
with
frantic
gestures
the
serpents
to
avoid
the
flames
wriggle
their
way
to
the
top
whence
they
are
seen
lashing
out
laterally
until
finally
obliged
to
drop
their
struggles
for
life
giving
rise
to
enthusiastic
delight
among
the
surrounding
spectators
this
is
a
favourite
annual
ceremony
for
the
inhabitants
of
luchon
and
its
neighbourhood
and
local
tradition
assigns
it
to
a
heathen
in
the
midsummer
fires
formerly
kindled
on
the
place
de
grève
at
paris
it
was
the
custom
to
burn
a
basket
barrel
or
sack
full
of
live
cats
which
was
hung
from
a
tall
mast
in
the
midst
of
the
bonfire
sometimes
a
fox
was
burned
the
people
collected
the
embers
and
ashes
of
the
fire
and
took
them
home
believing
that
they
brought
good
luck
the
french
kings
often
witnessed
these
spectacles
and
even
lit
the
bonfire
with
their
own
hands
in
louis
the
fourteenth
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
roses
and
carrying
a
bunch
of
roses
in
his
hand
kindled
the
fire
danced
at
it
and
partook
of
the
banquet
afterwards
in
the
town
hall
but
this
was
the
last
occasion
when
a
monarch
presided
at
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
paris
at
metz
midsummer
fires
were
lighted
with
great
pomp
on
the
esplanade
and
a
dozen
cats
enclosed
in
were
burned
alive
in
them
to
the
amusement
of
the
people
similarly
at
gap
in
the
department
of
the
high
alps
cats
used
to
be
roasted
over
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
russia
a
white
cock
was
sometimes
burned
in
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
meissen
or
thuringia
a
horse
s
head
used
to
be
thrown
into
it
sometimes
animals
are
burned
in
the
spring
bonfires
in
the
vosges
cats
were
burned
on
shrove
tuesday
in
alsace
they
were
thrown
into
the
easter
bonfire
in
the
department
of
the
ardennes
cats
were
flung
into
the
bonfires
kindled
on
the
first
sunday
in
lent
sometimes
by
a
refinement
of
cruelty
they
were
hung
over
the
fire
from
the
end
of
a
pole
and
roasted
alive
the
cat
which
represented
the
devil
could
never
suffer
while
the
creatures
were
perishing
in
the
flames
the
shepherds
guarded
their
flocks
and
forced
them
to
leap
over
the
fire
esteeming
this
an
infallible
means
of
preserving
them
from
disease
and
witchcraft
we
have
seen
that
squirrels
were
sometimes
burned
in
the
easter
fire
thus
it
appears
that
the
sacrificial
rites
of
the
celts
of
ancient
gaul
can
be
traced
in
the
popular
festivals
of
modern
europe
naturally
it
is
in
france
or
rather
in
the
wider
area
comprised
within
the
limits
of
ancient
gaul
that
these
rites
have
left
the
clearest
traces
in
the
customs
of
burning
giants
of
and
animals
enclosed
in
or
baskets
these
customs
it
will
have
been
remarked
are
generally
observed
at
or
about
midsummer
from
this
we
may
infer
that
the
original
rites
of
which
these
are
the
degenerate
successors
were
solemnized
at
midsummer
this
inference
harmonizes
with
the
conclusion
suggested
by
a
general
survey
of
european
that
the
midsummer
festival
must
on
the
whole
have
been
the
most
widely
diffused
and
the
most
solemn
of
all
the
yearly
festivals
celebrated
by
the
primitive
aryans
in
europe
at
the
same
time
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
among
the
british
celts
the
chief
of
the
year
appear
certainly
to
have
been
those
of
beltane
may
day
and
hallowe
en
the
last
day
of
october
and
this
suggests
a
doubt
whether
the
celts
of
gaul
also
may
not
have
celebrated
their
principal
rites
of
fire
including
their
burnt
sacrifices
of
men
and
animals
at
the
beginning
of
may
or
the
beginning
of
november
rather
than
at
midsummer
we
have
still
to
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
such
sacrifices
why
were
men
and
animals
burnt
to
death
at
these
festivals
if
we
are
right
in
interpreting
the
modern
european
as
attempts
to
break
the
power
of
witchcraft
by
burning
or
banning
the
witches
and
warlocks
it
seems
to
follow
that
we
must
explain
the
human
sacrifices
of
the
celts
in
the
same
manner
that
is
we
must
suppose
that
the
men
whom
the
druids
burnt
in
images
were
condemned
to
death
on
the
ground
that
they
were
witches
or
wizards
and
that
the
mode
of
execution
by
fire
was
chosen
because
as
we
have
seen
burning
alive
is
deemed
the
surest
mode
of
getting
rid
of
these
noxious
and
dangerous
beings
the
same
explanation
would
apply
to
the
cattle
and
wild
animals
of
many
kinds
which
the
celts
burned
along
with
the
men
they
too
we
may
conjecture
were
supposed
to
be
either
under
the
spell
of
witchcraft
or
actually
to
be
the
witches
and
wizards
who
had
transformed
themselves
into
animals
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
their
infernal
plots
against
the
welfare
of
their
fellow
creatures
this
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
the
victims
most
commonly
burned
in
modern
bonfires
have
been
cats
and
that
cats
are
precisely
the
animals
into
which
with
the
possible
exception
of
hares
witches
were
most
usually
supposed
to
transform
themselves
again
we
have
seen
that
serpents
and
foxes
used
sometimes
to
be
burnt
in
the
midsummer
fires
and
welsh
and
german
witches
are
reported
to
have
assumed
the
form
both
of
foxes
and
serpents
in
short
when
we
remember
the
great
variety
of
animals
whose
forms
witches
can
assume
at
pleasure
it
seems
easy
on
this
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
variety
of
living
creatures
that
have
been
burnt
at
festivals
both
in
ancient
gaul
and
modern
europe
all
these
victims
we
may
surmise
were
doomed
to
the
flames
not
because
they
were
animals
but
because
they
were
believed
to
be
witches
who
had
taken
the
shape
of
animals
for
their
nefarious
purposes
one
advantage
of
explaining
the
ancient
celtic
sacrifices
in
this
way
is
that
it
introduces
as
it
were
a
harmony
and
consistency
into
the
treatment
which
europe
has
meted
out
to
witches
from
the
earliest
times
down
to
about
two
centuries
ago
when
the
growing
influence
of
rationalism
discredited
the
belief
in
witchcraft
and
put
a
stop
to
the
custom
of
burning
witches
on
this
view
the
christian
church
in
its
dealings
with
the
black
art
merely
carried
out
the
traditional
policy
of
druidism
and
it
might
be
a
nice
question
to
decide
which
of
the
two
in
pursuance
of
that
policy
exterminated
the
larger
number
of
innocent
men
and
women
be
that
as
it
may
we
can
now
perhaps
understand
why
the
druids
believed
that
the
more
persons
they
sentenced
to
death
the
greater
would
be
the
fertility
of
the
land
to
a
modern
reader
the
connexion
at
first
sight
may
not
be
obvious
between
the
activity
of
the
hangman
and
the
productivity
of
the
earth
but
a
little
reflection
may
satisfy
him
that
when
the
criminals
who
perish
at
the
stake
or
on
the
gallows
are
witches
whose
delight
it
is
to
blight
the
crops
of
the
farmer
or
to
lay
them
low
under
storms
of
hail
the
execution
of
these
wretches
is
really
calculated
to
ensure
an
abundant
harvest
by
removing
one
of
the
principal
causes
which
paralyze
the
efforts
and
blast
the
hopes
of
the
husbandman
the
druidical
sacrifices
which
we
are
considering
were
explained
in
a
different
way
by
mannhardt
he
supposed
that
the
men
whom
the
druids
burned
in
wickerwork
images
represented
the
spirits
of
vegetation
and
accordingly
that
the
custom
of
burning
them
was
a
magical
ceremony
intended
to
secure
the
necessary
sunshine
for
the
crops
similarly
he
seems
to
have
inclined
to
the
view
that
the
animals
which
used
to
be
burnt
in
the
bonfires
represented
the
which
as
we
saw
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
work
is
often
supposed
to
assume
the
shape
of
an
animal
this
theory
is
no
doubt
tenable
and
the
great
authority
of
mannhardt
entitles
it
to
careful
consideration
i
adopted
it
in
former
editions
of
this
book
but
on
reconsideration
it
seems
to
me
on
the
whole
to
be
less
probable
than
the
theory
that
the
men
and
animals
burnt
in
the
fires
perished
in
the
character
of
witches
this
latter
view
is
strongly
supported
by
the
testimony
of
the
people
who
celebrate
the
since
a
popular
name
for
the
custom
of
kindling
the
fires
is
burning
the
witches
effigies
of
witches
are
sometimes
consumed
in
the
flames
and
the
fires
their
embers
or
their
ashes
are
supposed
to
furnish
protection
against
witchcraft
on
the
other
hand
there
is
little
to
shew
that
the
effigies
or
the
animals
burnt
in
the
fires
are
regarded
by
the
people
as
representatives
of
the
and
that
the
bonfires
are
with
regard
to
serpents
in
particular
which
used
to
be
burnt
in
the
midsummer
fire
at
luchon
i
am
not
aware
of
any
certain
evidence
that
in
europe
snakes
have
been
regarded
as
embodiments
of
the
or
though
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
conception
appears
to
be
not
unknown
whereas
the
popular
faith
in
the
transformation
of
witches
into
animals
is
so
general
and
deeply
rooted
and
the
fear
of
these
uncanny
beings
is
so
strong
that
it
seems
safer
to
suppose
that
the
cats
and
other
animals
which
were
burnt
in
the
fire
suffered
death
as
embodiments
of
witches
than
that
they
perished
as
representatives
of
chapter
viii
the
magic
flowers
of
midsummer
eve
a
feature
of
the
great
midsummer
festival
remains
to
be
considered
which
may
perhaps
help
to
clear
up
the
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
and
their
relation
to
druidism
for
in
france
and
england
the
countries
where
the
sway
of
the
druids
is
known
to
have
been
most
firmly
established
midsummer
eve
is
still
the
time
for
culling
certain
magic
plants
whose
evanescent
virtue
can
be
secured
at
this
mystic
season
alone
indeed
all
over
europe
antique
fancies
of
the
same
sort
have
lingered
about
midsummer
eve
imparting
to
it
a
fragrance
of
the
past
like
withered
rose
leaves
that
found
by
chance
in
the
pages
of
an
old
volume
still
smell
of
departed
summers
thus
in
saintonge
and
aunis
two
of
the
ancient
provinces
of
western
france
we
read
that
of
all
the
festivals
for
which
the
merry
bells
ring
out
there
is
not
one
which
has
given
rise
to
a
greater
number
of
superstitious
practices
than
the
festival
of
john
the
baptist
the
eve
of
john
was
the
day
of
all
days
for
gathering
the
wonderful
herbs
by
means
of
which
you
could
combat
fever
cure
a
host
of
diseases
and
guard
yourself
against
sorcerers
and
their
spells
but
in
order
to
attain
these
results
two
conditions
had
to
be
observed
first
you
must
be
fasting
when
you
gathered
the
herbs
and
second
you
must
cull
them
before
the
sun
rose
if
these
conditions
were
not
fulfilled
the
plants
had
no
special
in
the
neighbouring
province
of
perigord
the
person
who
gathered
the
magic
herbs
before
sunrise
at
this
season
had
to
walk
backwards
to
mutter
some
mystic
words
and
to
perform
certain
ceremonies
the
plants
thus
collected
were
carefully
kept
as
an
infallible
cure
for
fever
placed
above
beds
and
the
doors
of
houses
and
of
they
protected
man
and
beast
from
disease
witchcraft
and
accident
in
normandy
a
belief
in
the
marvellous
properties
of
herbs
and
plants
of
flowers
and
seeds
and
leaves
gathered
with
certain
traditional
rites
on
the
eve
or
the
day
of
john
has
remained
part
of
the
peasant
s
creed
to
this
day
thus
he
fancies
that
seeds
of
vegetables
and
plants
which
have
been
collected
on
john
s
eve
will
keep
better
than
others
and
that
flowers
plucked
that
day
will
never
fade
indeed
so
widespread
in
france
used
to
be
the
faith
in
the
magic
virtue
of
herbs
culled
on
that
day
that
there
is
a
french
proverb
to
employ
all
the
herbs
of
john
in
an
affair
meaning
to
leave
no
stone
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
traveller
reported
that
at
marseilles
on
the
eve
of
john
the
place
de
noailles
and
the
course
are
cleaned
from
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
flock
thither
and
by
six
o
clock
the
whole
place
is
covered
with
a
considerable
quantity
of
flowers
and
herbs
aromatic
or
otherwise
the
folk
attribute
superstitious
virtues
to
these
plants
they
are
persuaded
that
if
they
have
been
gathered
the
same
day
before
sunrise
they
are
fitted
to
heal
many
ailments
people
buy
them
emulously
to
give
away
in
presents
and
to
fill
the
house
on
the
eve
of
john
midsummer
eve
before
sunset
the
peasants
of
perche
still
gather
the
herb
called
john
s
herb
it
is
a
creeping
plant
very
aromatic
with
small
flowers
of
a
violet
blue
other
scented
flowers
are
added
and
out
of
the
posies
they
make
floral
crosses
and
crowns
which
they
hang
up
over
the
doors
of
houses
and
stables
such
floral
decorations
are
sold
like
the
on
palm
sunday
and
the
withered
wreaths
are
kept
from
year
to
year
if
an
animal
dies
it
may
be
a
cow
they
carefully
clean
the
byre
or
the
stable
make
a
pile
of
these
faded
garlands
and
set
them
on
fire
having
previously
closed
up
all
the
openings
and
interstices
so
that
the
whole
place
is
thoroughly
fumigated
this
is
thought
to
eradicate
the
germs
of
disease
from
the
byre
or
stable
at
nellingen
near
saaralben
in
lorraine
the
hedge
doctors
collect
their
store
of
simples
between
eleven
o
clock
and
noon
on
midsummer
day
and
on
that
day
is
brewed
from
nuts
that
have
been
picked
on
the
stroke
of
noon
such
water
is
a
panacea
for
all
ailments
in
the
vosges
mountains
they
say
that
wizards
have
but
one
day
in
the
year
and
but
one
hour
in
that
day
to
find
and
cull
the
baleful
herbs
which
they
use
in
their
black
art
that
day
is
the
eve
of
john
and
that
hour
is
the
time
when
the
church
bells
are
ringing
the
noonday
angelus
hence
in
many
villages
they
say
that
the
bells
ought
not
to
ring
at
noon
on
that
day
in
the
tyrol
also
they
think
that
the
witching
hour
is
when
the
bell
is
ringing
on
midsummer
eve
for
then
the
witches
go
forth
to
gather
the
noxious
plants
whereby
they
raise
thunderstorms
therefore
in
many
districts
the
bells
ring
for
a
shorter
time
than
usual
that
evening
at
folgareit
the
sexton
used
to
steal
quietly
into
the
church
and
when
the
clock
struck
three
he
contented
himself
with
giving
a
few
pulls
to
the
smallest
of
the
bells
at
rengen
in
the
eifel
mountains
the
sexton
rings
the
church
bell
for
an
hour
on
the
afternoon
of
midsummer
day
as
soon
as
the
bell
begins
to
ring
the
children
run
out
into
the
meadows
gather
flowers
and
weave
them
into
garlands
which
they
throw
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
buildings
there
the
garlands
remain
till
the
wind
blows
them
away
it
is
believed
that
they
protect
the
houses
against
fire
and
thunderstorms
at
niederehe
in
the
eifel
mountains
on
midsummer
day
little
children
used
to
make
wreaths
and
posies
out
of
st
john
s
flowers
and
and
throw
them
on
the
roofs
some
time
afterwards
when
the
wild
gooseberries
were
ripe
all
the
children
would
gather
round
an
old
woman
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
taking
the
now
withered
wreaths
and
posies
with
them
march
out
of
the
village
praying
while
they
walked
wreaths
and
posies
were
then
thrown
in
a
heap
and
kindled
whereupon
the
children
snatched
them
up
still
burning
and
ran
and
fumigated
the
wild
gooseberry
bushes
with
the
smoke
then
they
returned
with
the
old
woman
to
the
village
knelt
down
before
her
and
received
her
blessing
from
that
time
the
children
were
free
to
pick
and
eat
the
wild
gooseberries
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
the
peasants
gather
all
sorts
of
simples
on
midsummer
day
because
they
are
of
opinion
that
the
drugs
produce
their
medicinal
effect
only
if
they
have
been
culled
at
that
time
many
of
these
plants
especially
roots
must
be
dug
up
at
midnight
and
in
silence
in
mecklenburg
not
merely
is
a
special
healing
virtue
ascribed
to
simples
collected
on
midsummer
day
the
very
smoke
of
such
plants
if
they
are
burned
in
the
fire
is
believed
to
protect
a
house
against
thunder
and
lightning
and
to
still
the
raging
of
the
storm
the
wends
of
the
spreewald
twine
wreaths
of
herbs
and
flowers
at
midsummer
and
hang
them
up
in
their
rooms
and
when
any
one
gets
a
fright
he
will
lay
some
of
the
leaves
and
blossoms
on
hot
coals
and
fumigate
himself
with
the
smoke
in
eastern
prussia
some
two
hundred
years
ago
it
used
to
be
customary
on
midsummer
day
to
make
up
a
bunch
of
herbs
of
various
sorts
and
fasten
it
to
a
pole
which
was
then
put
up
over
the
gate
or
door
through
which
the
corn
would
be
brought
in
at
harvest
such
a
pole
was
called
kaupole
and
it
remained
in
its
place
till
the
crops
had
been
reaped
and
garnered
then
the
bunch
of
herbs
was
taken
down
part
of
it
was
put
with
the
corn
in
the
barn
to
keep
rats
and
mice
from
the
grain
and
part
was
kept
as
a
remedy
for
diseases
of
all
sorts
the
germans
of
west
bohemia
collect
simples
on
john
s
night
because
they
believe
the
healing
virtue
of
the
plants
to
be
especially
powerful
at
that
time
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
huzuls
in
the
carpathian
mountains
are
similar
they
imagine
that
the
plants
gathered
on
that
night
are
not
only
medicinal
but
possess
the
power
of
restraining
the
witches
some
say
that
the
herbs
should
be
plucked
in
twelve
gardens
or
meadows
among
the
simples
which
the
czechs
and
moravians
of
silesia
cull
at
this
season
are
dandelions
ribwort
and
the
bloom
of
the
the
esthonians
of
the
island
of
oesel
gather
john
s
herbs
on
john
s
day
tie
them
up
in
bunches
and
hang
them
up
about
the
houses
to
prevent
evil
spirits
from
entering
a
subsidiary
use
of
the
plants
is
to
cure
diseases
gathered
at
that
time
they
have
a
greater
medical
value
than
if
they
were
collected
at
any
other
season
everybody
does
not
choose
exactly
the
same
sorts
of
plants
some
gather
more
and
some
less
but
in
the
collection
john
s
wort
should
never
be
wanting
a
writer
of
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
informs
us
that
the
livonians
among
whom
he
lived
were
impressed
with
a
belief
in
the
great
and
marvellous
properties
possessed
by
simples
which
had
been
culled
on
midsummer
day
such
simples
they
thought
were
sure
remedies
for
fever
and
for
sickness
and
pestilence
in
man
and
beast
but
if
gathered
one
day
too
late
they
lost
all
their
virtue
among
the
letts
of
the
baltic
provinces
of
russia
girls
and
women
go
about
on
midsummer
day
crowned
with
wreaths
of
aromatic
plants
which
are
afterwards
hung
up
for
good
luck
in
the
houses
the
plants
are
also
dried
and
given
to
cows
to
eat
because
they
are
supposed
to
help
the
animals
to
calve
in
bulgaria
john
s
day
is
the
special
season
for
culling
simples
on
this
day
too
bulgarian
girls
gather
nosegays
of
a
certain
white
flower
throw
them
into
a
vessel
of
water
and
place
the
vessel
under
a
in
bloom
here
it
remains
all
night
next
morning
they
set
it
in
the
courtyard
and
dance
singing
round
it
an
old
woman
then
takes
the
flowers
out
of
the
vessel
and
the
girls
wash
themselves
with
the
water
praying
that
god
would
grant
them
health
throughout
the
year
after
that
the
old
woman
restores
her
nosegay
to
each
girl
and
promises
her
a
rich
husband
among
the
south
slavs
generally
on
john
s
eve
it
is
the
custom
for
girls
to
gather
white
flowers
in
the
meadows
and
to
place
them
in
a
sieve
or
behind
the
rafters
a
flower
is
assigned
to
each
member
of
the
household
next
morning
the
flowers
are
inspected
and
he
or
she
whose
flower
is
fresh
will
be
well
the
whole
year
but
he
or
she
whose
flower
is
faded
will
be
sickly
or
die
garlands
are
then
woven
out
of
the
flowers
and
laid
on
roofs
folds
and
beehives
in
some
parts
of
macedonia
on
john
s
eve
the
peasants
are
wont
to
festoon
their
cottages
and
gird
their
own
waists
with
wreaths
of
what
they
call
john
s
flower
it
is
the
blossom
of
a
creeping
plant
which
resembles
honeysuckle
similar
notions
as
to
the
magical
virtue
which
plants
acquire
at
midsummer
have
been
transported
by
europeans
to
the
new
world
at
la
paz
in
bolivia
people
believe
that
flowers
of
mint
gathered
before
sunrise
on
john
s
day
foretell
an
endless
felicity
to
such
as
are
so
lucky
as
to
find
them
nor
is
the
superstition
confined
to
europe
and
to
people
of
european
descent
in
morocco
also
the
mohammedans
are
of
opinion
that
certain
plants
such
as
marjoram
and
the
oleander
acquire
a
special
magic
virtue
when
they
are
gathered
shortly
before
midsummer
hence
the
people
collect
these
plants
at
this
season
and
preserve
them
for
magical
or
medical
purposes
for
example
branches
of
oleander
are
brought
into
the
houses
before
midsummer
and
kept
under
the
roof
as
a
charm
against
the
evil
eye
but
while
the
branches
are
being
brought
in
they
may
not
touch
the
ground
else
they
would
lose
their
marvellous
properties
cases
of
sickness
caused
by
the
evil
eye
are
cured
by
fumigating
the
patients
with
the
smoke
of
these
boughs
the
greatest
efficacy
is
ascribed
to
the
sultan
of
the
oleander
which
is
a
stalk
with
four
pairs
of
leaves
clustered
round
it
such
a
stalk
is
always
endowed
with
magical
virtue
but
that
virtue
is
greatest
when
the
stalk
has
been
cut
just
before
midsummer
arab
women
in
the
hiaina
district
of
morocco
gather
on
midsummer
day
dry
it
in
the
sun
and
make
it
into
a
powder
which
mixed
with
water
they
daub
on
the
heads
of
their
little
children
to
protect
them
from
sunstroke
and
vermin
and
to
make
their
hair
grow
well
indeed
such
marvellous
powers
do
these
arabs
attribute
to
plants
at
this
mystic
season
that
a
barren
woman
will
walk
naked
about
a
vegetable
garden
on
midsummer
night
in
the
hope
of
conceiving
a
child
through
the
fertilizing
influence
of
the
vegetables
sometimes
in
order
to
produce
the
desired
effect
it
is
deemed
necessary
that
seven
or
nine
different
sorts
of
plants
should
be
gathered
at
this
mystic
season
norman
peasants
who
wish
to
fortify
themselves
for
the
toil
of
harvest
will
sometimes
go
out
at
dawn
on
john
s
day
and
pull
seven
kinds
of
plants
which
they
afterwards
eat
in
their
soup
as
a
means
of
imparting
strength
and
suppleness
to
their
limbs
in
the
harvest
field
in
mecklenburg
maidens
are
wont
to
gather
seven
sorts
of
flowers
at
noon
on
midsummer
eve
these
they
weave
into
garlands
and
sleep
with
them
under
their
pillows
then
they
are
sure
to
dream
of
the
men
who
will
marry
them
but
the
flowers
on
which
youthful
lovers
dream
at
midsummer
eve
are
oftener
nine
in
number
thus
in
voigtland
nine
different
kinds
of
flowers
are
twined
into
a
garland
at
the
hour
of
noon
but
they
may
not
enter
the
dwelling
by
the
door
in
the
usual
way
they
must
be
passed
through
the
window
or
if
they
come
in
at
the
door
they
must
be
thrown
not
carried
into
the
house
sleeping
on
them
that
night
you
will
dream
of
your
future
wife
or
future
husband
the
bohemian
maid
who
gathers
nine
kinds
of
flowers
on
which
to
dream
of
love
at
midsummer
eve
takes
care
to
wrap
her
hand
in
a
white
cloth
and
afterwards
to
wash
it
in
dew
and
when
she
brings
her
garland
home
she
must
speak
no
word
to
any
soul
she
meets
by
the
way
for
then
all
the
magic
virtue
of
the
flowers
would
be
gone
other
bohemian
girls
look
into
the
book
of
fate
at
this
season
after
a
different
fashion
they
twine
their
hair
with
wreaths
made
of
nine
sorts
of
leaves
and
go
when
the
stars
of
the
summer
night
are
twinkling
in
the
sky
to
a
brook
that
flows
beside
a
tree
there
gazing
on
the
stream
the
girl
beholds
beside
the
broken
reflections
of
the
tree
and
the
stars
the
watery
image
of
her
future
lord
so
in
masuren
maidens
gather
nosegays
of
wild
flowers
in
silence
on
midsummer
eve
at
the
midnight
hour
each
girl
takes
the
nosegay
and
a
glass
of
water
and
when
she
has
spoken
certain
words
she
sees
her
lover
mirrored
in
the
water
sometimes
bohemian
damsels
make
a
different
use
of
their
midsummer
garlands
twined
of
nine
sorts
of
flowers
they
lie
down
with
the
garland
laid
as
a
pillow
under
their
right
ear
and
a
hollow
voice
swooning
from
underground
proclaims
their
destiny
yet
another
mode
of
consulting
the
oracle
by
means
of
these
same
garlands
is
to
throw
them
backwards
and
in
silence
upon
a
tree
at
the
hour
of
noon
just
when
the
flowers
have
been
gathered
for
every
time
that
the
wreath
is
thrown
without
sticking
to
the
branches
of
the
tree
the
girl
will
have
a
year
to
wait
before
she
weds
this
mode
of
divination
is
practised
in
voigtland
east
prussia
silesia
belgium
and
wales
and
the
same
thing
is
done
in
masuren
although
we
are
not
told
that
there
the
wreaths
must
be
composed
of
nine
sorts
of
flowers
however
in
masuren
chaplets
of
nine
kinds
of
herbs
are
gathered
on
john
s
eve
and
put
to
a
more
prosaic
use
than
that
of
presaging
the
course
of
true
love
they
are
carefully
preserved
and
the
people
brew
a
sort
of
tea
from
them
which
they
administer
as
a
remedy
for
many
ailments
or
they
keep
the
chaplets
under
their
pillows
till
they
are
dry
and
thereupon
dose
their
sick
cattle
with
them
in
esthonia
the
virtues
popularly
ascribed
to
wreaths
of
this
sort
are
many
and
various
these
wreaths
composed
of
nine
kinds
of
herbs
culled
on
the
eve
or
the
day
of
john
are
sometimes
inserted
in
the
roof
or
hung
up
on
the
walls
of
the
house
and
each
of
them
receives
the
name
of
one
of
the
inmates
if
the
plants
which
have
been
thus
dedicated
to
a
girl
happen
to
take
root
and
grow
in
the
chinks
and
crannies
she
will
soon
wed
if
they
have
been
dedicated
to
an
older
person
and
wither
away
that
person
will
die
the
people
also
give
them
as
medicine
to
cattle
at
the
time
when
the
animals
are
driven
forth
to
pasture
or
they
fumigate
the
beasts
with
the
smoke
of
the
herbs
which
are
burnt
along
with
shavings
from
the
wooden
threshold
bunches
of
the
plants
are
also
hung
about
the
house
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
and
maidens
lay
them
under
their
pillows
to
dream
on
in
sweden
the
midsummer
brooms
made
up
of
nine
sorts
of
flowers
gathered
on
midsummer
eve
are
put
to
nearly
the
same
uses
fathers
of
families
hang
up
such
brooms
to
the
rafters
one
for
each
inmate
of
the
house
and
he
or
she
whose
broom
is
the
first
to
wither
will
be
the
first
to
die
girls
also
dream
of
their
future
husbands
with
these
bunches
of
flowers
under
their
pillows
a
decoction
made
from
the
flowers
is
moreover
a
panacea
for
all
disorders
and
if
a
bunch
of
them
be
hung
up
in
the
cattle
shed
the
troll
can
not
enter
to
bewitch
the
beasts
the
germans
of
moravia
think
that
nine
kinds
of
herbs
gathered
on
john
s
night
midsummer
eve
are
a
remedy
for
fever
and
some
of
the
wends
attribute
a
curative
virtue
in
general
to
such
plants
of
the
flowers
which
it
has
been
customary
to
gather
for
purposes
of
magic
or
divination
at
midsummer
none
perhaps
is
so
widely
popular
as
john
s
wort
the
reason
for
associating
this
particular
plant
with
the
great
summer
festival
is
perhaps
not
far
to
seek
for
the
flower
blooms
about
midsummer
day
and
with
its
bright
yellow
petals
and
masses
of
golden
stamens
it
might
well
pass
for
a
tiny
copy
on
earth
of
the
great
sun
which
reaches
its
culminating
point
in
heaven
at
this
season
gathered
on
midsummer
eve
or
on
midsummer
day
before
sunrise
the
blossoms
are
hung
on
doorways
and
windows
to
preserve
the
house
against
thunder
witches
and
evil
spirits
and
various
healing
properties
are
attributed
to
the
different
species
of
the
plant
in
the
tyrol
they
say
that
if
you
put
john
s
wort
in
your
shoe
before
sunrise
on
midsummer
day
you
may
walk
as
far
as
you
please
without
growing
weary
in
scotland
people
carried
it
about
their
persons
as
an
amulet
against
witchcraft
on
the
lower
rhine
children
twine
chaplets
of
john
s
wort
on
the
morning
of
midsummer
day
and
throw
them
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
here
too
the
people
who
danced
round
the
midsummer
bonfires
used
to
wear
wreaths
of
these
yellow
flowers
in
their
hair
and
to
deck
the
images
of
the
saints
at
wayside
shrines
with
the
blossoms
sometimes
they
flung
the
flowers
into
the
bonfires
in
sicily
they
dip
john
s
wort
in
oil
and
so
apply
it
as
a
balm
for
every
wound
during
the
middle
ages
the
power
which
the
plant
notoriously
possesses
of
banning
devils
won
for
it
the
name
of
and
before
witches
and
wizards
were
stretched
on
the
rack
or
otherwise
tortured
the
flower
used
to
be
administered
to
them
as
a
means
of
wringing
the
truth
from
their
lips
in
north
wales
people
used
to
fix
sprigs
of
john
s
wort
over
their
doors
and
sometimes
over
their
windows
in
order
to
purify
their
houses
and
by
that
means
drive
away
all
fiends
and
evil
in
saintonge
and
aunis
the
flowers
served
to
detect
the
presence
of
sorcerers
for
if
one
of
these
pestilent
fellows
entered
a
house
the
bunches
of
john
s
wort
which
had
been
gathered
on
midsummer
eve
and
hung
on
the
walls
immediately
dropped
their
yellow
heads
as
if
they
had
suddenly
faded
however
the
germans
of
western
bohemia
think
that
witches
far
from
dreading
john
s
wort
actually
seek
the
plant
on
john
s
eve
further
the
edges
of
the
calyx
and
petals
of
john
s
wort
as
well
as
their
external
surface
are
marked
with
dark
purple
spots
and
lines
which
if
squeezed
yield
a
red
essential
oil
soluble
in
spirits
german
peasants
believe
that
this
red
oil
is
the
blood
of
john
and
this
may
be
why
the
plant
is
supposed
to
heal
all
sorts
of
wounds
in
mecklenburg
they
say
that
if
you
pull
up
john
s
wort
at
noon
on
midsummer
day
you
will
find
at
the
root
a
bead
of
red
juice
called
john
s
blood
smear
this
blood
on
your
shirt
just
over
your
heart
and
no
mad
dog
will
bite
you
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
the
same
blood
procured
in
the
same
manner
and
rubbed
on
the
barrel
of
a
gun
will
make
every
shot
from
that
gun
to
hit
the
mark
according
to
others
john
s
blood
is
found
at
noon
on
john
s
day
and
only
then
adhering
in
the
form
of
beads
to
the
root
of
a
weed
called
knawel
which
grows
in
sandy
soil
but
some
people
say
that
these
beads
of
red
juice
are
not
really
the
blood
of
the
martyred
saint
but
only
insects
resembling
the
cochineal
or
about
hanover
i
have
often
observed
devout
roman
catholics
going
on
the
morning
of
john
s
day
to
neighbouring
sandhills
gathering
on
the
roots
of
herbs
a
certain
insect
looking
like
drops
of
blood
and
thought
by
them
to
be
created
on
purpose
to
keep
alive
the
remembrance
of
the
foul
murder
of
john
the
baptist
and
only
to
be
met
with
on
the
morning
of
the
day
set
apart
for
him
by
the
church
i
believe
the
life
of
this
insect
is
very
ephemeral
but
by
no
means
restricted
to
the
of
yet
another
plant
whose
root
has
been
thought
to
yield
the
blood
of
john
is
the
hawkweed
which
grows
very
commonly
in
dry
exposed
places
such
as
gravelly
banks
sunny
lawns
and
the
tops
of
park
walls
it
blossoms
from
may
to
the
end
of
july
presenting
its
elegant
flowers
to
the
noontide
sun
while
the
surrounding
herbage
and
even
its
own
foliage
is
withered
and
burnt
up
and
these
round
yellow
flowers
may
be
likened
not
inaptly
to
the
disc
of
the
great
luminary
whose
light
they
love
at
hildesheim
in
germany
people
used
to
dig
up
hawkweed
especially
on
the
gallows
hill
when
the
clocks
were
striking
noon
on
midsummer
day
and
the
blood
of
john
which
they
found
at
the
roots
was
carefully
preserved
in
quills
for
good
luck
a
little
of
it
smeared
secretly
on
the
clothes
was
sure
to
make
the
wearer
fortunate
in
the
market
that
day
according
to
some
the
plant
ought
to
be
dug
up
with
a
gold
coin
near
gablonz
in
bohemia
it
used
to
be
customary
to
make
a
bed
of
john
s
flowers
as
they
were
called
on
john
s
eve
and
in
the
night
the
saint
himself
came
and
laid
his
head
on
the
bed
next
morning
you
could
see
the
print
of
his
head
on
the
flowers
which
derived
a
healing
virtue
from
his
blessed
touch
and
were
mixed
with
the
fodder
of
sick
cattle
to
make
them
whole
but
whether
these
john
s
flowers
were
the
hawkweed
or
not
is
doubtful
more
commonly
in
germany
the
name
of
john
s
flowers
appears
to
be
given
to
the
mountain
arnica
in
voigtland
the
mountain
arnica
if
plucked
on
john
s
eve
and
stuck
in
the
fields
laid
under
the
roof
or
hung
on
the
wall
is
believed
to
protect
house
and
fields
from
lightning
and
hail
so
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
they
think
that
no
thunderstorm
can
harm
a
house
which
has
a
blossom
of
mountain
arnica
in
the
window
or
the
roof
and
in
the
tyrol
the
same
flower
fastened
to
the
door
will
render
the
dwelling
but
it
is
needless
to
remark
that
the
flower
which
takes
its
popular
name
from
john
will
be
no
protection
against
either
fire
or
thunder
unless
it
has
been
culled
on
the
saint
s
own
day
another
plant
which
possesses
wondrous
virtues
if
only
it
be
gathered
on
the
eve
or
the
day
of
john
is
mugwort
hence
in
france
it
goes
by
the
name
of
the
herb
of
st
john
near
péronne
in
the
french
department
of
somme
people
used
to
go
out
fasting
before
sunrise
on
john
s
day
to
cull
the
plant
put
among
the
wheat
in
the
barn
it
protected
the
corn
against
mice
in
artois
people
carried
bunches
of
mugwort
or
wore
it
round
their
body
in
poitou
they
still
wear
girdles
of
mugwort
or
hemp
when
they
warm
their
backs
at
the
midsummer
fire
as
a
preservative
against
backache
at
harvest
and
the
custom
of
wearing
girdles
of
mugwort
on
the
eve
or
day
of
john
has
caused
the
plant
to
be
popularly
known
in
germany
and
bohemia
as
john
s
girdle
in
bohemia
such
girdles
are
believed
to
protect
the
wearer
for
the
whole
year
against
ghosts
magic
misfortune
and
sickness
people
also
weave
garlands
of
the
plant
and
look
through
them
at
the
midsummer
bonfire
or
put
them
on
their
heads
and
by
doing
so
they
ensure
that
their
heads
will
not
ache
nor
their
eyes
smart
all
that
year
another
bohemian
practice
is
to
make
a
decoction
of
mugwort
which
has
been
gathered
on
john
s
day
then
when
your
cow
is
bewitched
and
will
yield
no
milk
you
have
only
to
wash
the
animal
thrice
with
the
decoction
and
the
spell
will
be
broken
in
germany
people
used
to
crown
their
heads
or
gird
their
bodies
with
mugwort
which
they
afterwards
threw
into
the
midsummer
bonfire
pronouncing
certain
rhymes
and
believing
that
they
thus
rid
themselves
of
all
their
sometimes
wreaths
or
girdles
of
mugwort
were
kept
in
houses
and
throughout
the
year
in
normandy
such
wreaths
are
a
protection
against
thunder
and
thieves
and
stalks
of
mugwort
hinder
witches
from
laying
their
spells
on
the
butter
in
the
isle
of
man
on
midsummer
eve
people
gathered
or
mugwort
as
a
preventive
against
the
influence
of
witchcraft
in
belgium
bunches
of
mugwort
gathered
on
john
s
day
or
eve
and
hung
on
the
doors
of
stables
and
houses
are
believed
to
bring
good
luck
and
to
furnish
a
protection
against
sorcery
it
is
curious
to
find
that
in
china
a
similar
use
is
or
was
formerly
made
of
mugwort
at
the
same
season
of
the
year
in
an
old
chinese
calendar
we
read
that
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
fifth
month
the
four
classes
of
the
people
gambol
in
the
herbage
and
have
competitive
games
with
plants
of
all
kinds
they
pluck
mugwort
and
make
dolls
of
it
which
they
suspend
over
their
gates
and
doors
in
order
to
expel
poisonous
airs
or
on
this
custom
professor
de
groot
observes
notice
that
the
plant
owed
its
efficacy
to
the
time
when
it
was
plucked
a
day
denoting
the
midsummer
festival
when
light
and
fire
of
the
universe
are
in
their
on
account
of
this
valuable
property
mugwort
is
used
by
chinese
surgeons
in
cautery
the
ainos
of
japan
employ
bunches
of
mugwort
in
exorcisms
because
it
is
thought
that
demons
of
disease
dislike
the
smell
and
flavour
of
this
it
is
an
old
german
belief
that
he
who

they
say
that
if
you
will
dig
up
a
plant
of
mugwort
at
noon
on
midsummer
day
you
will
find
under
the
root
a
burning
coal
which
vanishes
away
as
soon
as
the
church
bells
have
ceased
to
ring
if
you
find
the
coal
and
carry
it
off
in
silence
it
will
prove
a
remedy
for
all
sorts
of
maladies
according
to
another
german
superstition
such
a
coal
will
turn
to
gold
english
writers
record
the
popular
belief
that
a
rare
coal
is
to
be
found
under
the
root
of
mugwort
at
a
single
hour
of
a
single
day
in
the
year
namely
at
noon
or
midnight
on
midsummer
eve
and
that
this
coal
will
protect
him
who
carries
it
on
his
person
from
plague
carbuncle
lightning
fever
and
ague
in
eastern
prussia
on
john
s
eve
people
can
foretell
a
marriage
by
means
of
mugwort
they
bend
two
stalks
of
the
growing
plant
outward
and
then
observe
whether
the
stalks
after
straightening
themselves
again
incline
towards
each
other
or
not
a
similar
mode
of
divination
has
been
practised
both
in
england
and
in
germany
with
the
orpine
a
plant
which
grows
on
a
gravelly
or
chalky
soil
about
hedges
the
borders
of
fields
and
on
bushy
hills
it
flowers
in
august
and
the
blossoms
consist
of
dense
clustered
tufts
of
crimson
or
purple
petals
sometimes
but
rarely
the
flowers
are
white
in
england
the
plant
is
popularly
known
as
midsummer
men
because
people
used
to
plant
slips
of
them
in
pairs
on
midsummer
eve
one
slip
standing
for
a
young
man
and
the
other
for
a
young
woman
if
the
plants
as
they
grew
up
bent
towards
each
other
the
couple
would
marry
if
either
of
them
withered
he
or
she
whom
it
represented
would
die
in
masuren
westphalia
and
switzerland
the
method
of
forecasting
the
future
by
means
of
the
orpine
is
precisely
the
same
another
plant
which
popular
superstition
has
often
associated
with
the
summer
solstice
is
vervain
in
some
parts
of
spain
people
gather
vervain
after
sunset
on
midsummer

and
wash
their
faces
next
morning
in
the
water
in
which
the
plants
have
been
allowed
to
steep
overnight
in
belgium
vervain
is
gathered
on
john
s
day
and
worn
as
a
safeguard
against
rupture
in
normandy
the
peasants
cull
vervain
on
the
day
or
the
eve
of
john
believing
that
besides
its
medical
properties
it
possesses
at
this
season
the
power
of
protecting
the
house
from
thunder
and
lightning
from
sorcerers

bohemian
poachers
wash
their

guns
which
have
been
thus
treated
never
miss
the

in

country
vervain
used
to
be
sought
for
its
magical
virtues
on

they
think
that
he
who
finds
a
clover
while
the
is
ringing
on

can
work
magic
from
that
time
forth
people
in

say
that
the
clover
is
endowed
with
all
its
marvellous
virtues
only
when
it
has
been
plucked
by
a
virgin
on
the
night
of

for
the
flowers
plucked
at
the
moment
when
the

is
at
the
highest
point
of
his
course
are
supposed
to
possess
the
medicinal
qualities
of
the
plant
in
the
highest
degree
in
heathen
times
the
camomile
flower
with
its
healing
qualities
its
yellow
calix
and
white
stamens
is
said
to
have
been
sacred

shining
balder

to
have
borne
his

also
the
belief
prevails
that
camomile
is
most
potent
as
a
drug
when
it
has
been
gathered
on
midsummer
day
in

the

must
always
be

nine
different
kinds
of
plants
that
are
culled
on

to
form
wreaths
and

a
remedy
for
many
sorts
of
maladies
thuringian
peasants
hold
that
if
the
root
of
the
yellow
mullein
has
been
dug
up
in

with
a

to
die
perhaps
the
bright
yellow
flowers
of
mullein
clustering
round
the
stem
like
lighted
candles
may
partly
account
for
the
association

great
mullein

called
the

known
as

the
yellow
hoary
mullein

a

pyramid
a
yard
high
of
many
hundreds
of
flowers
and
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
of
british
herbaceous
we
may
trace
a
relation
between
mullein
and
the
sun
in
the
prussian
custom
of
bending
the
flower
after
sunset
towards
the
point
where
the

at

time
that
a

fancy
that

russian
peasants
regard
the
plant
known
as
purple
loosestrife
with
respect
and
even
fear
wizards
make
much
use
of
it
they
dig
the
root
up
on
john
s
morning
at
break
of
day
without
the
use
of
iron
tools
and
they
believe
that
by
means
of
the
root
as
well
as
of
the
blossom
they
can
subdue
evil
spirits
and
make
them
serviceable
and
also
drive
away
witches
and
the
demons
that
guard
treasures
more
famous
however
than
these
are
the
marvellous
properties
which
popular
superstition
in
many
parts
of
europe
has
attributed
to
the
fern
at
this
season
at
midnight
on
midsummer
eve
the
plant
is
supposed
to
bloom
and
soon
afterwards
to
seed
and
whoever
catches
the
bloom
or
the
seed
is
thereby
endowed
with
supernatural
knowledge
and
miraculous
powers
above
all
he
knows
where
treasures
lie
hidden
in
the
ground
and
he
can
render
himself
invisible
at
will
by
putting
the
seed
in
his
shoe
but
great
precautions
must
be
observed
in
procuring
the
wondrous
bloom
or
seed
which
else
quickly
vanishes
like
dew
on
sand
or
mist
in
the
air
the
seeker
must
neither
touch
it
with
his
hand
nor
let
it
touch
the
ground
he
spreads
a
white
cloth
under
the
plant
and
the
blossom
or
the
seed
falls
into
it
beliefs
of
this
sort
concerning
have
prevailed
with
trifling
variations
of
detail
in
england
france
germany
austria
italy
and
russia
in
bohemia
the
magic
bloom
is
said
to
be
golden
and
to
glow
or
sparkle
like
fire
in
russia
they
say
that
at
dead
of
night
on
midsummer
eve
the
plant
puts
forth
buds
like
glowing
coals
which
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
burst
open
with
a
clap
like
thunder
and
light
up
everything
near
and
far
in
the
azores
they
say
that
the
fern
only
blooms
at
midnight
on
john
s
eve
and
that
no
one
ever
sees
the
flower
because
the
fairies
instantly
carry
it
off
but
if
any
one
watching
till
it
opens
throws
a
cloth
over
it
and
then
when
the
magic
hour
has
passed
burns
the
blossoms
carefully
the
ashes
will
serve
as
a
mirror
in
which
you
can
read
the
fate
of
absent
friends
if
your
friends
are
well
and
happy
the
ashes
will
resume
the
shape
of
a
lovely
flower
but
if
they
are
unhappy
or
dead
the
ashes
will
remain
cold
and
lifeless
in
thuringia
people
think
that
he
who
has
on
his
person
or
in
his
house
the
male
fern
filix
can
not
be
bewitched
they
call
it
john
s
root
and
say
that
it
blooms
thrice
in
the
year
on
christmas
eve
easter
eve
and
the
day
of
john
the
baptist
it
should
be
dug
up
when
the
sun
enters
the
sign
of
the
lion
armed
with
this
powerful
implement
you
can
detect
a
sorcerer
at
any
gathering
it
may
be
a
wedding
feast
or
what
not
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
put
the
root
under
the
tablecloth
unseen
by
the
rest
of
the
company
and
if
there
should
be
a
sorcerer
among
them
he
will
turn
as
pale
as
death
and
get
up
and
go
away
fear
and
horror
come
over
him
when
the
is
under
the
tablecloth
and
when
oxen
horses
or
other
domestic
cattle
are
bewitched
by
wicked
people
you
need
only
take
the
root
at
full
moon
soak
it
in
water
and
sprinkle
the
cattle
with
the
water
or
rub
them
down
with
a
cloth
that
has
been
steeped
in
it
and
witchcraft
will
have
no
more
power
over
the
animals
once
more
people
have
fancied
that
if
they
cut
a
branch
of
hazel
on
midsummer
eve
it
would
serve
them
as
a
divining
rod
to
discover
treasures
and
water
this
belief
has
existed
in
moravia
mecklenburg
and
apparently
in
scotland
in
the
mark
of
brandenburg
they
say
that
if
you
would
procure
the
mystic
wand
you
must
go
to
the
hazel
by
night
on
midsummer
eve
walking
backwards
and
when
you
have
come
to
the
bush
you
must
silently
put
your
hands
between
your
legs
and
cut
a
stick
that
stick
will
be
the
and
as
such
will
detect
treasures
buried
in
the
ground
if
you
have
any
doubt
as
to
the
quality
of
the
wand
you
have
only
to
hold
it
in
water
for
in
that
case
your
true
will
squeak
like
a
pig
but
your
spurious
one
will
not
in
bavaria
they
say
that
the
should
be
cut
from
a
hazel
bush
between
eleven
and
twelve
on
john
s
night
and
that
by
means
of
it
you
can
discover
not
only
veins
of
metal
and
underground
springs
but
also
thieves
and
murderers
and
unknown
ways
in
cutting
it
you
should
say
god
greet
thee
thou
noble
twig
with
god
the
father
i
seek
thee
with
god
the
son
i
find
thee
with
the
might
of
god
the
holy
ghost
i
break
thee
i
adjure
thee
rod
and
sprig
by
the
power
of
the
highest
that
thou
shew
me
what
i
order
and
that
as
sure
and
clear
as
mary
the
mother
of
god
was
a
pure
virgin
when
she
bare
our
lord
jesus
in
the
name
of
god
the
father
god
the
son
and
god
the
holy
ghost
amen
in
berlin
and
the
neighbourhood
they
say
that
every
seventh
year
there
grows
a
wonderful
branch
on
a
hazel
bush
and
that
branch
is
the
only
an
innocent
child
born
on
a
sunday
and
nursed
in
the
true
faith
can
find
it
on
john
s
night
to
him
then
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
lie
open
in
the
tyrol
the
ought
to
be
cut
at
new
moon
but
may
be
cut
either
on
john
s
day
or
on
twelfth
night
having
got
it
you
baptize
it
in
the
name
of
one
of
the
three
holy
kings
according
to
the
purpose
for
which
you
intend
to
use
it
if
the
rod
is
to
discover
gold
you
name
it
caspar
if
it
is
to
reveal
silver
you
call
it
balthasar
and
if
it
is
to
point
out
hidden
springs
of
water
you
dub
it
melchior
in
lechrain
the
is
a
yearling
shoot
of
hazel
with
two
branches
a
good
time
for
cutting
it
is
new
moon
and
if
the
sun
is
rising
so
much
the
better
as
for
the
day
of
the
year
you
may
take
your
choice
between
john
s
day
twelfth
night
and
shrove
tuesday
if
cut
with
the
proper
form
of
words
the
rod
will
as
usual
discover
underground
springs
and
hidden
treasures
midsummer
eve
is
also
the
favourite
time
for
procuring
the
in
sweden
some
say
that
it
should
then
be
cut
from
a
mistletoe
bough
however
other
people
in
sweden
are
of
opinion
that
the
which
is
obtained
on
midsummer
eve
ought
to
be
compounded
out
of
four
different
kinds
of
wood
to
wit
mistletoe
the
aspen
and
another
and
they
say
that
the
which
is
employed
for
this
purpose
should
like
the
mistletoe
be
a
parasite
growing
from
the
hollow
root
of
a
fallen
tree
whither
the
seed
was
carried
by
a
bird
or
wafted
by
the
wind
armed
with
this
fourfold
implement
of
power
the
proceeds
at
sundown
to
the
spot
where
he
expects
to
find
hidden
wealth
there
he
lays
the
rod
on
the
ground
in
perfect
silence
and
when
it
lies
directly
over
treasure
it
will
begin
to
hop
about
as
if
it
were
alive
a
mystical
plant
which
to
some
extent
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
is
the
springwort
which
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
in
the
harz
mountains
they
say
that
many
years
ago
there
was
a
wondrous
flower
called
springwort
or
johnswort
which
was
as
rare
as
it
was
marvellous
it
bloomed
only
on
john
s
night
some
say
under
a
fern
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
twelve
but
when
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
was
struck
the
flower
vanished
away
only
in
mountainous
regions
where
many
noble
metals
reposed
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
was
the
flower
seen
now
and
then
in
lonely
meadows
among
the
hills
the
spirits
of
the
hills
wished
by
means
of
it
to
shew
to
men
where
their
treasures
were
to
be
found
the
flower
itself
was
yellow
and
shone
like
a
lamp
in
the
darkness
of
night
it
never
stood
still
but
kept
hopping
constantly
to
and
fro
it
was
also
afraid
of
men
and
fled
before
them
and
no
man
ever
yet
plucked
it
unless
he
had
been
set
apart
by
providence
for
the
task
to
him
who
was
lucky
enough
to
cull
it
the
flower
revealed
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
and
it
made
him
rich
oh
so
rich
and
so
happy
however
the
usual
account
given
of
the
springwort
is
somewhat
different
they
say
that
the
way
to
procure
it
is
this
you
mark
a
hollow
in
a
tree
where
a
green
or
black
woodpecker
has
built
its
nest
and
hatched
its
young
you
plug
up
the
hole
with
a
wooden
wedge
then
you
hide
behind
the
tree
and
wait
the
woodpecker
meantime
has
flown
away
but
very
soon
returns
with
the
springwort
in
its
bill
it
flutters
up
to
the
holding
the
springwort
to
the
wedge
which
at
once
as
if
struck
by
a
hammer
jumps
out
with
a
bang
now
is
your
chance
you
rush
from
your
concealment
you
raise
a
loud
cry
and
in
its
fright
the
bird
opens
its
bill
and
drops
the
springwort
quick
as
thought
you
reach
out
a
red
or
white
cloth
with
which
you
have
taken
care
to
provide
yourself
and
catch
the
magic
flower
as
it
falls
the
treasure
is
now
yours
before
its
marvellous
power
all
doors
and
locks
fly
open
it
can
make
the
bearer
of
it
invisible
and
neither
steel
nor
lead
can
wound
the
man
who
carries
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
that
is
why
people
in
swabia
say
of
a
thief
who
can
not
be
caught
he
must
surely
have
a
the
superstition
which
associates
the
springwort
with
the
woodpecker
is
very
ancient
for
it
is
recorded
by
pliny
it
was
a
vulgar
belief
he
tells
us
that
if
a
shepherd
plugged
up
a
woodpecker
s
nest
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
with
a
wedge
the
bird
would
bring
a
herb
which
caused
the
wedge
to
slip
out
of
the
hole
trebius
indeed
affirmed
that
the
wedge
leaped
out
with
a
bang
however
hard
and
fast
you
might
have
driven
it
into
the
tree
another
flower
which
possesses
the
same
remarkable
power
of
bursting
open
all
doors
and
locks
is
chicory
provided
always
that
you
cut
the
flower
with
a
piece
of
gold
at
noon
or
midnight
on
james
s
day
the
of
july
but
in
cutting
it
you
must
be
perfectly
silent
if
you
utter
a
sound
it
is
all
up
with
you
there
was
a
man
who
was
just
about
to
cut
the
flower
of
the
chicory
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
millstone
hovering
over
his
head
he
fled
for
his
life
and
fortunately
escaped
but
had
he
so
much
as
opened
his
lips
the
millstone
would
have
dropped
on
him
and
crushed
him
as
flat
as
a
pancake
however
it
is
only
a
rare
white
variety
of
the
chicory
flower
which
can
act
as
a
picklock
the
common
bright
blue
flower
is
perfectly
useless
for
the
purpose
many
more
examples
might
perhaps
be
cited
of
the
marvellous
virtues
which
certain
plants
have
been
supposed
to
acquire
at
the
summer
solstice
but
the
foregoing
instances
may
suffice
to
prove
that
the
superstition
is
widely
spread
deeply
rooted
and
therefore
probably
very
ancient
in
europe
why
should
plants
be
thought
to
be
endowed
with
these
wonderful
properties
on
the
longest
day
more
than
on
any
other
day
of
the
year
it
seems
difficult
or
impossible
to
explain
such
a
belief
except
on
the
supposition
that
in
some
mystic
way
the
plants
catch
from
the
sun
then
at
the
full
height
of
his
power
and
glory
some
fleeting
effluence
of
radiant
light
and
heat
which
invests
them
for
a
time
with
powers
above
the
ordinary
for
the
healing
of
diseases
and
the
unmasking
and
baffling
of
all
the
evil
things
that
threaten
the
life
of
man
that
the
supposition
is
not
purely
hypothetical
will
appear
from
a
to
be
noticed
later
on
in
which
the
magic
bloom
of
the
fern
is
directly
derived
from
the
sun
at
noon
on
midsummer
day
and
if
the
magic
flowers
of
midsummer
eve
thus
stand
in
direct
relation
to
the
sun
which
many
of
them
resemble
in
shape
and
colour
blooming
in
the
meadows
like
little
yellow
suns
fallen
from
the
blue
sky
does
it
not
become
probable
that
the
bonfires
kindled
at
the
same
time
are
the
artificial
as
the
flowers
are
the
natural
imitations
of
the
great
celestial
fire
then
blazing
in
all
its
strength
at
least
analogy
seems
to
favour
the
inference
and
so
far
to
support
mannhardt
s
theory
that
the
bonfires
kindled
at
the
popular
festivals
of
europe
especially
at
the
summer
solstice
are
intended
to
reinforce
the
waning
or
waxing
fires
of
the
sun
thus
if
in
our
enquiry
into
these
the
scales
of
judgment
are
loaded
with
the
adverse
theories
of
mannhardt
and
westermarck
we
may
say
that
the
weight
light
as
it
is
of
the
magic
flowers
of
midsummer
eve
seems
to
incline
the
trembling
balance
back
to
the
side
of
mannhardt
nor
is
it
perhaps
an
argument
against
mannhardt
s
view
that
the
midsummer
flowers
and
plants
are
so
often
employed
as
talismans
to
break
the
spells
of
witchcraft
for
granted
that
employment
which
is
undeniable
we
have
still
to
explain
it
and
that
we
can
hardly
do
except
by
reference
to
the
midsummer
sun
and
what
is
here
said
of
the
midsummer
flowers
applies
equally
to
the
midsummer
bonfires
they
too
are
used
to
destroy
the
charms
of
witches
and
warlocks
but
if
they
can
do
so
may
it
not
be
in
part
because
fires
at
midsummer
are
thought
to
burn
with
fiercer
fury
than
at
other
times
by
sympathy
with
the
fiercer
fervour
of
the
sun
this
consideration
would
bring
us
back
to
an
intermediate
position
between
the
opposing
theories
namely
to
the
view
that
while
the
purely
destructive
aspect
of
fire
is
generally
the
most
prominent
and
apparently
the
most
important
at
these
festivals
we
must
not
overlook
the
additional
force
which
by
virtue
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
the
bonfires
may
be
supposed
both
to
derive
from
and
to
impart
to
the
sun
especially
at
the
moment
of
the
summer
solstice
when
his
strength
is
greatest
and
begins
to
decline
and
when
accordingly
he
can
at
once
give
and
receive
help
to
the
greatest
advantage
to
conclude
this
part
of
our
subject
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
illustrate
by
a
few
more
miscellaneous
examples
the
belief
that
midsummer
eve
is
one
of
the
great
days
of
the
year
in
which
witches
and
warlocks
pursue
their
nefarious
calling
indeed
in
this
respect
midsummer
eve
perhaps
stands
second
only
to
the
famous
walpurgis
night
the
eve
of
may
day
for
instance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lierre
in
belgium
the
people
think
that
on
the
night
of
midsummer
eve
all
witches
and
warlocks
must
repair
to
a
certain
field
which
is
indicated
to
them
beforehand
there
they
hold
their
infernal
sabbath
and
are
passed
in
review
by
a
hellish
magician
who
bestows
on
them
fresh
powers
that
is
why
old
women
are
most
careful
before
going
to
bed
on
that
night
to
stop
up
doors
and
windows
and
every
other
opening
in
order
to
bar
out
the
witches
and
warlocks
who
but
for
this
sage
precaution
might
steal
into
the
house
and
make
the
first
trial
of
their
new
powers
on
the
unfortunate
inmates
at
rottenburg
in
swabia
people
thought
that
the
devil
and
the
witches
could
do
much
harm
on
midsummer
eve
so
they
made
fast
their
shutters
and
bunged
up
even
the
chinks
and
crannies
for
wherever
air
can
penetrate
there
the
devil
and
witches
can
worm
their
way
in
all
night
long
too
from
nine
in
the
evening
till
break
of
day
the
church
bells
rang
to
disturb
the
dreadful
beings
at
their
evil
work
since
there
is
perhaps
no
better
means
of
putting
the
whole
devilish
crew
to
flight
than
the
sound
of
church
bells
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
belief
in
witches
was
still
widespread
in
voigtland
a
bleak
mountainous
region
of
central
germany
it
was
especially
on
the
eve
of
may
day
walpurgis
thomas
s
day
john
s
day
and
christmas
eve
as
well
as
on
mondays
that
they
were
dreaded
then
they
would
come
into
a
neighbour
s
house
to
beg
borrow
or
steal
something
no
matter
what
but
woe
to
the
poor
wretch
who
suffered
them
to
carry
away
so
much
as
a
chip
or
splinter
of
wood
for
they
would
certainly
use
it
to
his
undoing
on
these
witching
nights
the
witches
rode
to
their
sabbath
on
and
the
dashers
of
churns
but
if
when
they
were
hurtling
through
the
darkness
any
one
standing
below
addressed
one
of
the
witches
by
name
she
would
die
within
the
year
to
counteract
and
undo
the
spells
which
witches
cast
on
man
and
beast
people
resorted
to
all
kinds
of
measures
thus
on
the
days
folk
made
three
crosses
on
the
doors
of
the
byres
or
guarded
them
by
hanging
up
john
s
wort
marjoram
or
other
equally
powerful
talismans
very
often
too
the
village
youth
would
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
s
quarters
by
marching
out
in
a
body
cracking
whips
firing
guns
waving
burning
besoms
shouting
and
making
an
uproar
all
for
the
purpose
of
frightening
and
driving
away
the
witches
in
prussia
witches
and
warlocks
used
regularly
to
assemble
twice
a
year
on
walpurgis
night
and
the
eve
of
john
the
places
where
they
held
their
infernal
sabbath
were
various
for
example
one
was
pogdanzig
in
the
district
of
schlochau
they
generally
rode
on
a
but
often
on
a
black
horse
and
they
took
their
departure
up
the
chimney
with
the
words
up
and
away
and
nowhere
to
stop
when
they
were
all
gathered
on
the
blocksberg
or
mount
of
the
witches
they
held
high
revelry
feasting
first
and
then
dancing
on
a
tight
rope
to
the
inspiring
strains
which
an
old
warlock
drew
from
a
drum
and
a
pig
s
head
the
south
slavs
believe
that
on
the
night
of
midsummer
eve
a
witch
will
slink
up
to
the
fence
of
the
farmyard
and
say
the
cheese
to
me
the
lard
to
me
the
butter
to
me
the
milk
to
me
but
the
cowhide
to
thee
after
that
the
cow
will
perish
miserably
and
you
will
be
obliged
to
bury
the
flesh
and
sell
the
hide
to
prevent
this
disaster
the
thing
to
do
is
to
go
out
into
the
meadows
very
early
on
midsummer
morning
while
the
dew
is
on
the
grass
collect
a
quantity
of
dew
in
a
waterproof
mantle
carry
it
home
and
having
tethered
your
cow
wash
her
down
with
the
dew
after
that
you
have
only
to
place
a
milkpail
under
her
udders
and
to
milk
away
as
hard
as
you
can
the
amount
of
milk
that
you
will
extract
from
that
cow
s
dugs
is
quite
surprising
again
the
slovenians
about
görz
and
the
croats
of
istria
believe
that
on
the
same
night
the
witches
wage
pitched
battles
with
baptized
folk
attacking
them
fiercely
with
broken
stakes
of
palings
and
stumps
of
trees
it
is
therefore
a
wise
precaution
to
grub
up
all
the
stumps
in
autumn
and
carry
them
home
so
that
the
witches
may
be
weaponless
on
john
s
night
if
the
stumps
are
too
heavy
to
be
grubbed
up
it
is
well
to
ram
them
down
tighter
into
the
earth
for
then
the
witches
will
not
be
able
to
pull
them
up
chapter
ix
balder
and
the
mistletoe
the
reader
may
remember
that
the
preceding
account
of
the
popular
of
europe
was
suggested
by
the
myth
of
the
norse
god
balder
who
is
said
to
have
been
slain
by
a
branch
of
mistletoe
and
burnt
in
a
great
fire
we
have
now
to
enquire
how
far
the
customs
which
have
been
passed
in
review
help
to
shed
light
on
the
myth
in
this
enquiry
it
may
be
convenient
to
begin
with
the
mistletoe
the
instrument
of
balder
s
death
from
time
immemorial
the
mistletoe
has
been
the
object
of
superstitious
veneration
in
europe
it
was
worshipped
by
the
druids
as
we
learn
from
a
famous
passage
of
pliny
after
enumerating
the
different
kinds
of
mistletoe
he
proceeds
in
treating
of
this
subject
the
admiration
in
which
the
mistletoe
is
held
throughout
gaul
ought
not
to
pass
unnoticed
the
druids
for
so
they
call
their
wizards
esteem
nothing
more
sacred
than
the
mistletoe
and
the
tree
on
which
it
grows
provided
only
that
the
tree
is
an
oak
but
apart
from
this
they
choose
for
their
sacred
groves
and
perform
no
sacred
rites
without
so
that
the
very
name
of
druids
may
be
regarded
as
a
greek
appellation
derived
from
their
worship
of
the
oak
for
they
believe
that
whatever
grows
on
these
trees
is
sent
from
heaven
and
is
a
sign
that
the
tree
has
been
chosen
by
the
god
himself
the
mistletoe
is
very
rarely
to
be
met
with
but
when
it
is
found
they
gather
it
with
solemn
ceremony
this
they
do
above
all
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
from
whence
they
date
the
beginnings
of
their
months
of
their
years
and
of
their
thirty
years
cycle
because
by
the
sixth
day
the
moon
has
plenty
of
vigour
and
has
not
run
half
its
course
after
due
preparations
have
been
made
for
a
sacrifice
and
a
feast
under
the
tree
they
hail
it
as
the
universal
healer
and
bring
to
the
spot
two
white
bulls
whose
horns
have
never
been
bound
before
a
priest
clad
in
a
white
robe
climbs
the
tree
and
with
a
golden
sickle
cuts
the
mistletoe
which
is
caught
in
a
white
cloth
then
they
sacrifice
the
victims
praying
that
god
may
make
his
own
gift
to
prosper
with
those
upon
whom
he
has
bestowed
it
they
believe
that
a
potion
prepared
from
mistletoe
will
make
barren
animals
to
bring
forth
and
that
the
plant
is
a
remedy
against
all
poison
so
much
of
men
s
religion
is
commonly
concerned
with
in
another
passage
pliny
tells
us
that
in
medicine
the
mistletoe
which
grows
on
an
oak
was
esteemed
the
most
efficacious
and
that
its
efficacy
was
by
some
superstitious
people
supposed
to
be
increased
if
the
plant
was
gathered
on
the
first
day
of
the
moon
without
the
use
of
iron
and
if
when
gathered
it
was
not
allowed
to
touch
the
earth
thus
obtained
was
deemed
a
cure
for
epilepsy
carried
about
by
women
it
assisted
them
to
conceive
and
it
healed
ulcers
most
effectually
if
only
the
sufferer
chewed
a
piece
of
the
plant
and
laid
another
piece
on
the
sore
yet
again
he
says
that
mistletoe
was
supposed
like
vinegar
and
an
egg
to
be
an
excellent
means
of
extinguishing
a
fire
if
in
these
latter
passages
pliny
refers
as
he
apparently
does
to
the
beliefs
current
among
his
contemporaries
in
italy
it
will
follow
that
the
druids
and
the
italians
were
to
some
extent
agreed
as
to
the
valuable
properties
possessed
by
mistletoe
which
grows
on
an
oak
both
of
them
deemed
it
an
effectual
remedy
for
a
number
of
ailments
and
both
of
them
ascribed
to
it
a
quickening
virtue
the
druids
believing
that
a
potion
prepared
from
mistletoe
would
fertilize
barren
cattle
and
the
italians
holding
that
a
piece
of
mistletoe
carried
about
by
a
woman
would
help
her
to
conceive
a
child
further
both
peoples
thought
that
if
the
plant
were
to
exert
its
medicinal
properties
it
must
be
gathered
in
a
certain
way
and
at
a
certain
time
it
might
not
be
cut
with
iron
hence
the
druids
cut
it
with
gold
and
it
might
not
touch
the
earth
hence
the
druids
caught
it
in
a
white
cloth
in
choosing
the
time
for
gathering
the
plant
both
peoples
were
determined
by
observation
of
the
moon
only
they
differed
as
to
the
particular
day
of
the
moon
the
italians
preferring
the
first
and
the
druids
the
sixth
with
these
beliefs
of
the
ancient
gauls
and
italians
as
to
the
wonderful
medicinal
properties
of
mistletoe
we
may
compare
the
similar
beliefs
of
the
modern
ainos
of
japan
we
read
that
they
like
many
nations
of
the
northern
origin
hold
the
mistletoe
in
peculiar
veneration
they
look
upon
it
as
a
medicine
good
in
almost
every
disease
and
it
is
sometimes
taken
in
food
and
at
others
separately
as
a
decoction
the
leaves
are
used
in
preference
to
the
berries
the
latter
being
of
too
sticky
a
nature
for
general
purposes
but
many
too
suppose
this
plant
to
have
the
power
of
making
the
gardens
bear
plentifully
when
used
for
this
purpose
the
leaves
are
cut
up
into
fine
pieces
and
after
having
been
prayed
over
are
sown
with
the
millet
and
other
seeds
a
little
also
being
eaten
with
the
food
barren
women
have
also
been
known
to
eat
the
mistletoe
in
order
to
be
made
to
bear
children
that
mistletoe
which
grows
upon
the
willow
is
supposed
to
have
the
greatest
efficacy
this
is
because
the
willow
is
looked
upon
by
them
as
being
an
especially
sacred
thus
the
ainos
agree
with
the
druids
in
regarding
mistletoe
as
a
cure
for
almost
every
disease
and
they
agree
with
the
ancient
italians
that
applied
to
women
it
helps
them
to
bear
children
a
similar
belief
as
to
the
fertilizing
influence
of
mistletoe
or
of
similar
plants
upon
women
is
entertained
by
the
natives
of
mabuiag
an
island
in
torres
straits
these
savages
imagine
that
twins
can
be
produced
by
the
pregnant
woman
touching
or
breaking
a
branch
of
a
loranthaceous
plant
probably
parasitic
on
a
tree
the
wood
of
this
tree
is
much
esteemed
for
making
digging
sticks
and
as
firewood
no
properties
are
inherent
in
it
nor
is
it
regarded
as
being
infected
with
the
properties
of
its
again
the
druidical
notion
that
the
mistletoe
was
an
or
panacea
may
be
compared
with
a
notion
entertained
by
the
walos
of
senegambia
these
people
have
much
veneration
for
a
sort
of
mistletoe
which
they
call
they
carry
leaves
of
it
on
their
persons
when
they
go
to
war
as
a
preservative
against
wounds
just
as
if
the
leaves
were
real
talismans
the
french
writer
who
records
this
practice
adds
is
it
not
very
curious
that
the
mistletoe
should
be
in
this
part
of
africa
what
it
was
in
the
superstitions
of
the
gauls
this
prejudice
common
to
the
two
countries
may
have
the
same
origin
blacks
and
whites
will
doubtless
have
seen
each
of
them
for
themselves
something
supernatural
in
a
plant
which
grows
and
flourishes
without
having
roots
in
the
earth
may
they
not
have
believed
in
fact
that
it
was
a
plant
fallen
from
the
sky
a
gift
of
the
divinity
this
suggestion
as
to
the
origin
of
the
superstition
is
strongly
confirmed
by
the
druidical
belief
reported
by
pliny
that
whatever
grew
on
an
oak
was
sent
from
heaven
and
was
a
sign
that
the
tree
had
been
chosen
by
the
god
himself
such
a
belief
explains
why
the
druids
cut
the
mistletoe
not
with
a
common
knife
but
with
a
golden
sickle
and
why
when
cut
it
was
not
suffered
to
touch
the
earth
probably
they
thought
that
the
celestial
plant
would
have
been
profaned
and
its
marvellous
virtue
lost
by
contact
with
the
ground
with
the
ritual
observed
by
the
druids
in
cutting
the
mistletoe
we
may
compare
the
ritual
which
in
cambodia
is
prescribed
in
a
similar
case
they
say
that
when
you
see
an
orchid
growing
as
a
parasite
on
a
tamarind
tree
you
should
dress
in
white
take
a
new
earthenware
pot
then
climb
the
tree
at
noon
break
off
the
plant
put
it
in
the
pot
and
let
the
pot
fall
to
the
ground
after
that
you
make
in
the
pot
a
decoction
which
confers
the
gift
of
invulnerability
thus
just
as
in
africa
the
leaves
of
one
parasitic
plant
are
supposed
to
render
the
wearer
invulnerable
so
in
cambodia
a
decoction
made
from
another
parasitic
plant
is
considered
to
render
the
same
service
to
such
as
make
use
of
it
whether
by
drinking
or
washing
we
may
conjecture
that
in
both
places
the
notion
of
invulnerability
is
suggested
by
the
position
of
the
plant
which
occupying
a
place
of
comparative
security
above
the
ground
appears
to
promise
to
its
fortunate
possessor
a
similar
security
from
some
of
the
ills
that
beset
the
life
of
man
on
earth
we
have
already
met
with
many
examples
of
the
store
which
the
primitive
mind
sets
on
such
vantage
grounds
whatever
may
be
the
origin
of
these
beliefs
and
practices
concerning
the
mistletoe
certain
it
is
that
some
of
them
have
their
analogies
in
the
of
modern
european
peasants
for
example
it
is
laid
down
as
a
rule
in
various
parts
of
europe
that
mistletoe
may
not
be
cut
in
the
ordinary
way
but
must
be
shot
or
knocked
down
with
stones
from
the
tree
on
which
it
is
growing
thus
in
the
swiss
canton
of
aargau
all
parasitic
plants
are
esteemed
in
a
certain
sense
holy
by
the
country
folk
but
most
particularly
so
the
mistletoe
growing
on
an
oak
they
ascribe
great
powers
to
it
but
shrink
from
cutting
it
off
in
the
usual
manner
instead
of
that
they
procure
it
in
the
following
manner
when
the
sun
is
in
sagittarius
and
the
moon
is
on
the
wane
on
the
first
third
or
fourth
day
before
the
new
moon
one
ought
to
shoot
down
with
an
arrow
the
mistletoe
of
an
oak
and
to
catch
it
with
the
left
hand
as
it
falls
such
mistletoe
is
a
remedy
for
every
ailment
of
here
among
the
swiss
peasants
as
among
the
druids
of
old
special
virtue
is
ascribed
to
mistletoe
which
grows
on
an
oak
it
may
not
be
cut
in
the
usual
way
it
must
be
caught
as
it
falls
to
the
ground
and
it
is
esteemed
a
panacea
for
all
diseases
at
least
of
children
in
sweden
also
it
is
a
popular
superstition
that
if
mistletoe
is
to
possess
its
peculiar
virtue
it
must
either
be
shot
down
out
of
the
oak
or
knocked
down
with
stones
similarly
so
late
as
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
people
in
wales
believed
that
for
the
mistletoe
to
have
any
power
it
must
be
shot
or
struck
down
with
stones
off
the
tree
where
it
again
in
respect
of
the
healing
virtues
of
mistletoe
the
opinion
of
modern
peasants
and
even
of
the
learned
has
to
some
extent
agreed
with
that
of
the
ancients
the
druids
appear
to
have
called
the
plant
or
perhaps
the
oak
on
which
it
grew
the
and
is
said
to
be
still
a
name
of
the
mistletoe
in
the
modern
celtic
speech
of
brittany
wales
ireland
and
scotland
on
john
s
morning
midsummer
morning
peasants
of
piedmont
and
lombardy
go
out
to
search
the
for
the
oil
of
john
which
is
supposed
to
heal
all
wounds
made
with
cutting
instruments
originally
perhaps
the
oil
of
john
was
simply
the
mistletoe
or
a
decoction
made
from
it
for
in
holstein
the
mistletoe
especially
is
still
regarded
as
a
panacea
for
green
wounds
and
as
a
sure
charm
to
secure
success
in
hunting
and
at
lacaune
in
the
south
of
france
the
old
druidical
belief
in
the
mistletoe
as
an
antidote
to
all
poisons
still
survives
among
the
peasantry
they
apply
the
plant
to
the
stomach
of
the
sufferer
or
give
him
a
decoction
of
it
to
drink
again
the
ancient
belief
that
mistletoe
is
a
cure
for
epilepsy
has
survived
in
modern
times
not
only
among
the
ignorant
but
among
the
learned
thus
in
sweden
persons
afflicted
with
the
falling
sickness
think
they
can
ward
off
attacks
of
the
malady
by
carrying
about
with
them
a
knife
which
has
a
handle
of
oak
mistletoe
and
in
germany
for
a
similar
purpose
pieces
of
mistletoe
used
to
be
hung
round
the
necks
of
children
in
the
french
province
of
bourbonnais
a
popular
remedy
for
epilepsy
is
a
decoction
of
mistletoe
which
has
been
gathered
on
an
oak
on
john
s
day
and
boiled
with
so
at
bottesford
in
lincolnshire
a
decoction
of
mistletoe
is
supposed
to
be
a
palliative
for
this
terrible
disease
indeed
mistletoe
was
recommended
as
a
remedy
for
the
falling
sickness
by
high
medical
authorities
in
england
and
holland
down
to
the
eighteenth
century
at
in
lincolnshire
it
is
thought
that
vitus
s
dance
may
be
cured
by
the
water
in
which
mistletoe
berries
have
been
boiled
in
the
scotch
shires
of
elgin
and
moray
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
at
the
full
moon
of
march
people
used
to
cut
withes
of
mistletoe
or
ivy
make
circles
of
them
keep
them
all
the
year
and
profess
to
cure
hectics
and
other
troubles
by
means
of
them
in
sweden
apparently
for
other
complaints
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
is
hung
round
the
patient
s
neck
or
a
ring
of
it
is
worn
on
his
finger
however
the
opinion
of
the
medical
profession
as
to
the
curative
virtues
of
mistletoe
has
undergone
a
radical
alteration
whereas
the
druids
thought
that
mistletoe
cured
everything
modern
doctors
appear
to
think
that
it
cures
nothing
if
they
are
right
we
must
conclude
that
the
ancient
and
widespread
faith
in
the
medicinal
virtue
of
mistletoe
is
a
pure
superstition
based
on
nothing
better
than
the
fanciful
inferences
which
ignorance
has
drawn
from
the
parasitic
nature
of
the
plant
its
position
high
up
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
seeming
to
protect
it
from
the
dangers
to
which
plants
and
animals
are
subject
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
from
this
point
of
view
we
can
perhaps
understand
why
mistletoe
has
so
long
and
so
persistently
been
prescribed
as
a
cure
for
the
falling
sickness
as
mistletoe
can
not
fall
to
the
ground
because
it
is
rooted
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
high
above
the
earth
it
seems
to
follow
as
a
necessary
consequence
that
an
epileptic
patient
can
not
possibly
fall
down
in
a
fit
so
long
as
he
carries
a
piece
of
mistletoe
in
his
pocket
or
a
decoction
of
mistletoe
in
his
stomach
such
a
train
of
reasoning
would
probably
be
regarded
even
now
as
cogent
by
a
large
portion
of
the
human
species
again
the
ancient
italian
opinion
that
mistletoe
extinguishes
fire
appears
to
be
shared
by
swedish
peasants
who
hang
up
bunches
of
on
the
ceilings
of
their
rooms
as
a
protection
against
harm
in
general
and
conflagration
in
particular
a
hint
as
to
the
way
in
which
mistletoe
comes
to
be
possessed
of
this
property
is
furnished
by
the
epithet
which
people
of
the
aargau
canton
in
switzerland
apply
to
the
plant
for
a
is
a
shaggy
bushy
excrescence
on
branches
of
trees
which
is
popularly
believed
to
be
produced
by
a
flash
of
lightning
hence
in
bohemia
a
burnt
in
the
fire
protects
the
house
against
being
struck
by
a
being
itself
a
product
of
lightning
it
naturally
serves
on
homoeopathic
principles
as
a
protection
against
lightning
in
fact
as
a
kind
of
hence
the
fire
which
mistletoe
in
sweden
is
designed
especially
to
avert
from
houses
may
be
fire
kindled
by
lightning
though
no
doubt
the
plant
is
equally
effective
against
conflagration
in
general
again
mistletoe
acts
as
a
as
well
as
a
for
it
is
said
to
open
all
locks
however
in
the
tyrol
it
can
only
exert
this
power
under
certain
circumstances
which
are
not
specified
but
perhaps
the
most
precious
of
all
the
virtues
of
mistletoe
is
that
it
affords
efficient
protection
against
sorcery
and
witchcraft
that
no
doubt
is
the
reason
why
in
austria
a
twig
of
mistletoe
is
laid
on
the
threshold
as
a
preventive
of
nightmare
and
it
may
be
the
reason
why
in
the
north
of
england
they
say
that
if
you
wish
your
dairy
to
thrive
you
should
give
your
bunch
of
mistletoe
to
the
first
cow
that
calves
after
new
year
s
day
for
it
is
well
known
that
nothing
is
so
fatal
to
milk
and
butter
as
witchcraft
similarly
in
wales
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
good
luck
to
the
dairy
people
used
to
give
a
branch
of
mistletoe
to
the
first
cow
that
gave
birth
to
a
calf
after
the
first
hour
of
the
new
year
and
in
rural
districts
of
wales
where
mistletoe
abounded
there
was
always
a
profusion
of
it
in
the
farmhouses
when
mistletoe
was
scarce
welsh
farmers
used
to
say
no
mistletoe
no
luck
but
if
there
was
a
fine
crop
of
mistletoe
they
expected
a
fine
crop
of
corn
in
sweden
mistletoe
is
diligently
sought
after
on
john
s
eve
the
people
believing
it
to
be
in
a
high
degree
possessed
of
mystic
qualities
and
that
if
a
sprig
of
it
be
attached
to
the
ceiling
of
the
the
horse
s
stall
or
the
cow
s
crib
the
troll
will
then
be
powerless
to
injure
either
man
or
with
regard
to
the
time
when
the
mistletoe
should
be
gathered
opinions
have
varied
the
druids
gathered
it
above
all
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
the
ancient
italians
apparently
on
the
first
day
of
the
moon
in
modern
times
some
have
preferred
the
full
moon
of
march
and
others
the
waning
moon
of
winter
when
the
sun
is
in
sagittarius
but
the
favourite
time
would
seem
to
be
midsummer
eve
or
midsummer
day
we
have
seen
that
both
in
france
and
sweden
special
virtues
are
ascribed
to
mistletoe
gathered
at
midsummer
the
rule
in
sweden
is
that
mistletoe
must
be
cut
on
the
night
of
midsummer
eve
when
sun
and
moon
stand
in
the
sign
of
their
again
in
wales
it
was
believed
that
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
gathered
on
john
s
eve
midsummer
eve
or
at
any
time
before
the
berries
appeared
would
induce
dreams
of
omen
both
good
and
bad
if
it
were
placed
under
the
pillow
of
the
sleeper
thus
mistletoe
is
one
of
the
many
plants
whose
magical
or
medicinal
virtues
are
believed
to
culminate
with
the
culmination
of
the
sun
on
the
longest
day
of
the
year
hence
it
seems
reasonable
to
conjecture
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
druids
also
who
revered
the
plant
so
highly
the
sacred
mistletoe
may
have
acquired
a
double
portion
of
its
mystic
qualities
at
the
solstice
in
june
and
that
accordingly
they
may
have
regularly
cut
it
with
solemn
ceremony
on
midsummer
eve
be
that
as
it
may
certain
it
is
that
the
mistletoe
the
instrument
of
balder
s
death
has
been
regularly
gathered
for
the
sake
of
its
mystic
qualities
on
midsummer
eve
in
scandinavia
balder
s
home
the
plant
is
found
commonly
growing
on
oaks
and
other
trees
in
thick
damp
woods
throughout
the
more
temperate
parts
of
sweden
thus
one
of
the
two
main
incidents
of
balder
s
myth
is
reproduced
in
the
great
midsummer
festival
of
scandinavia
but
the
other
main
incident
of
the
myth
the
burning
of
balder
s
body
on
a
pyre
has
also
its
counterpart
in
the
bonfires
which
still
blaze
or
blazed
till
lately
in
denmark
norway
and
sweden
on
midsummer
eve
it
does
not
appear
indeed
that
any
effigy
is
burned
in
these
bonfires
but
the
burning
of
an
effigy
is
a
feature
which
might
easily
drop
out
after
its
meaning
was
forgotten
and
the
name
of
balder
s
balefires
s
by
which
these
midsummer
fires
were
formerly
known
in
sweden
puts
their
connexion
with
balder
beyond
the
reach
of
doubt
and
makes
it
probable
that
in
former
times
either
a
living
representative
or
an
effigy
of
balder
was
annually
burned
in
them
midsummer
was
the
season
sacred
to
balder
and
the
swedish
poet
tegner
in
placing
the
burning
of
balder
at
midsummer
may
very
well
have
followed
an
old
tradition
that
the
summer
solstice
was
the
time
when
the
good
god
came
to
his
untimely
end
thus
it
has
been
shewn
that
the
leading
incidents
of
the
balder
myth
have
their
counterparts
in
those
of
our
european
peasantry
which
undoubtedly
date
from
a
time
long
prior
to
the
introduction
of
christianity
the
pretence
of
throwing
the
victim
chosen
by
lot
into
the
beltane
fire
and
the
similar
treatment
of
the
man
the
future
green
wolf
at
the
midsummer
bonfire
in
normandy
may
naturally
be
interpreted
as
traces
of
an
older
custom
of
actually
burning
human
beings
on
these
occasions
and
the
green
dress
of
the
green
wolf
coupled
with
the
leafy
envelope
of
the
young
fellow
who
trod
out
the
midsummer
fire
at
moosheim
seems
to
hint
that
the
persons
who
perished
at
these
festivals
did
so
in
the
character
of
or
deities
of
vegetation
from
all
this
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
in
the
balder
myth
on
the
one
hand
and
the
and
custom
of
gathering
mistletoe
on
the
other
hand
we
have
as
it
were
the
two
broken
and
dissevered
halves
of
an
original
whole
in
other
words
we
may
assume
with
some
degree
of
probability
that
the
myth
of
balder
s
death
was
not
merely
a
myth
that
is
a
description
of
physical
phenomena
in
imagery
borrowed
from
human
life
but
that
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
story
which
people
told
to
explain
why
they
annually
burned
a
human
representative
of
the
god
and
cut
the
mistletoe
with
solemn
ceremony
if
i
am
right
the
story
of
balder
s
tragic
end
formed
so
to
say
the
text
of
the
sacred
drama
which
was
acted
year
by
year
as
a
magical
rite
to
cause
the
sun
to
shine
trees
to
grow
crops
to
thrive
and
to
guard
man
and
beast
from
the
baleful
arts
of
fairies
and
trolls
of
witches
and
warlocks
the
tale
belonged
in
short
to
that
class
of
nature
myths
which
are
meant
to
be
supplemented
by
ritual
here
as
so
often
myth
stood
to
magic
in
the
relation
of
theory
to
practice
but
if
the
human
died
by
fire
whether
in
spring
or
at
midsummer
were
put
to
death
as
living
embodiments
of
or
deities
of
vegetation
it
would
seem
that
balder
himself
must
have
been
a
or
deity
of
vegetation
it
becomes
desirable
therefore
to
determine
if
we
can
the
particular
kind
of
tree
or
trees
of
which
a
personal
representative
was
burned
at
the
for
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
it
was
not
as
a
representative
of
vegetation
in
general
that
the
victim
suffered
death
the
idea
of
vegetation
in
general
is
too
abstract
to
be
primitive
most
probably
the
victim
at
first
represented
a
particular
kind
of
sacred
tree
now
of
all
european
trees
none
has
such
claims
as
the
oak
to
be
considered
as
the
sacred
tree
of
the
aryans
its
worship
is
attested
for
all
the
great
branches
of
the
aryan
stock
in
europe
we
have
seen
that
it
was
not
only
the
sacred
tree
but
the
principal
object
of
worship
of
both
celts
and
lithuanians
the
roving
celts
appear
to
have
carried
their
worship
of
the
oak
with
them
even
to
asia
for
in
the
heart
of
asia
minor
the
galatian
senate
met
in
a
place
which
bore
the
pure
celtic
name
of
drynemetum
or
temple
of
the
among
the
slavs
the
oak
seems
to
have
been
the
sacred
tree
of
the
great
god
perun
according
to
grimm
the
oak
ranked
first
among
the
holy
trees
of
the
germans
it
is
certainly
known
to
have
been
adored
by
them
in
the
age
of
heathendom
and
traces
of
its
worship
have
survived
in
various
parts
of
germany
almost
to
the
present
day
among
the
ancient
italians
the
oak
was
sacred
above
all
other
trees
the
image
of
jupiter
on
the
capitol
at
rome
seems
to
have
been
originally
nothing
but
a
natural
at
dodona
perhaps
the
oldest
of
all
greek
sanctuaries
zeus
was
worshipped
as
immanent
in
the
sacred
oak
and
the
rustling
of
its
leaves
in
the
wind
was
his
voice
if
then
the
great
god
of
both
greeks
and
romans
was
represented
in
some
of
his
oldest
shrines
under
the
form
of
an
oak
and
if
the
oak
was
the
principal
object
of
worship
of
celts
germans
and
lithuanians
we
may
certainly
conclude
that
this
tree
was
venerated
by
the
aryans
in
common
before
the
dispersion
and
that
their
primitive
home
must
have
lain
in
a
land
which
was
clothed
with
forests
of
oak
now
considering
the
primitive
character
and
remarkable
similarity
of
the
observed
by
all
the
branches
of
the
aryan
race
in
europe
we
may
infer
that
these
festivals
form
part
of
the
common
stock
of
religious
observances
which
the
various
peoples
carried
with
them
in
their
wanderings
from
their
old
home
but
if
i
am
right
an
essential
feature
of
those
primitive
was
the
burning
of
a
man
who
represented
the
in
view
then
of
the
place
occupied
by
the
oak
in
the
religion
of
the
aryans
the
presumption
is
that
the
tree
so
represented
at
the
must
originally
have
been
the
oak
so
far
as
the
celts
and
lithuanians
are
concerned
this
conclusion
will
perhaps
hardly
be
contested
but
both
for
them
and
for
the
germans
it
is
confirmed
by
a
remarkable
piece
of
religious
conservatism
the
most
primitive
method
known
to
man
of
producing
fire
is
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
wood
against
each
other
till
they
ignite
and
we
have
seen
that
this
method
is
still
used
in
europe
for
kindling
sacred
fires
such
as
the
and
that
most
probably
it
was
formerly
resorted
to
at
all
the
under
discussion
now
it
is
sometimes
required
that
the
or
other
sacred
fire
should
be
made
by
the
friction
of
a
particular
kind
of
wood
and
when
the
kind
of
wood
is
prescribed
whether
among
celts
germans
or
slavs
that
wood
appears
to
be
generally
the
oak
thus
we
have
seen
that
amongst
the
slavs
of
masuren
the
new
fire
for
the
village
is
made
on
midsummer
day
by
causing
a
wheel
to
revolve
rapidly
round
an
axle
of
oak
till
the
axle
takes
fire
when
the
perpetual
fire
which
the
ancient
slavs
used
to
maintain
chanced
to
go
out
it
was
rekindled
by
the
friction
of
a
piece
of
which
had
been
previously
heated
by
being
struck
with
a
grey
not
a
red
stone
in
germany
and
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
was
regularly
and
in
russia
and
among
the
south
slavs
it
was
sometimes
kindled
by
the
friction
of
and
both
in
wales
and
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
beltane
fires
were
lighted
by
similar
means
now
if
the
sacred
fire
was
regularly
kindled
by
the
friction
of
we
may
infer
that
originally
the
fire
was
also
fed
with
the
same
material
in
point
of
fact
it
appears
that
the
perpetual
fire
of
vesta
at
rome
was
fed
with
and
that
was
the
fuel
consumed
in
the
perpetual
fire
which
burned
under
the
sacred
oak
at
the
great
lithuanian
sanctuary
of
romove
further
that
was
formerly
the
fuel
burned
in
the
midsummer
fires
may
perhaps
be
inferred
from
the
custom
said
to
be
still
observed
by
peasants
in
many
mountain
districts
of
germany
of
making
up
the
cottage
fire
on
midsummer
day
with
a
heavy
block
of
the
block
is
so
arranged
that
it
smoulders
slowly
and
is
not
finally
reduced
to
charcoal
till
the
expiry
of
a
year
then
upon
next
midsummer
day
the
charred
embers
of
the
old
log
are
removed
to
make
room
for
the
new
one
and
are
mixed
with
the
or
scattered
about
the
garden
this
is
believed
to
guard
the
food
cooked
on
the
hearth
from
witchcraft
to
preserve
the
luck
of
the
house
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
crops
and
to
preserve
them
from
blight
and
vermin
thus
the
custom
is
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
of
the
which
in
parts
of
germany
france
england
servia
and
other
slavonic
lands
was
commonly
of
at
the
boeotian
festival
of
the
daedala
the
analogy
of
which
to
the
spring
and
midsummer
festivals
of
modern
europe
has
been
already
pointed
out
the
great
feature
was
the
felling
and
burning
of
an
oak
the
general
conclusion
is
that
at
those
periodic
or
occasional
ceremonies
the
ancient
aryans
both
kindled
and
fed
the
fire
with
the
sacred
but
if
at
these
solemn
rites
the
fire
was
regularly
made
of
it
follows
that
any
man
who
was
burned
in
it
as
a
personification
of
the
could
have
represented
no
tree
but
the
oak
the
sacred
oak
was
thus
burned
in
duplicate
the
wood
of
the
tree
was
consumed
in
the
fire
and
along
with
it
was
consumed
a
living
man
as
a
personification
of
the
the
conclusion
thus
drawn
for
the
european
aryans
in
general
is
confirmed
in
its
special
application
to
the
scandinavians
by
the
relation
in
which
amongst
them
the
mistletoe
appears
to
have
stood
to
the
burning
of
the
victim
in
the
midsummer
fire
we
have
seen
that
among
scandinavians
it
has
been
customary
to
gather
the
mistletoe
at
midsummer
but
so
far
as
appears
on
the
face
of
this
custom
there
is
nothing
to
connect
it
with
the
midsummer
fires
in
which
human
victims
or
effigies
of
them
were
burned
even
if
the
fire
as
seems
probable
was
originally
always
made
with
why
should
it
have
been
necessary
to
pull
the
mistletoe
the
last
link
between
the
midsummer
customs
of
gathering
the
mistletoe
and
lighting
the
bonfires
is
supplied
by
balder
s
myth
which
can
hardly
be
disjoined
from
the
customs
in
question
the
myth
suggests
that
a
vital
connexion
may
once
have
been
believed
to
subsist
between
the
mistletoe
and
the
human
representative
of
the
oak
who
was
burned
in
the
fire
according
to
the
myth
balder
could
be
killed
by
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
except
the
mistletoe
and
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
remained
on
the
oak
he
was
not
only
immortal
but
invulnerable
now
if
we
suppose
that
balder
was
the
oak
the
origin
of
the
myth
becomes
intelligible
the
mistletoe
was
viewed
as
the
seat
of
life
of
the
oak
and
so
long
as
it
was
uninjured
nothing
could
kill
or
even
wound
the
oak
the
conception
of
the
mistletoe
as
the
seat
of
life
of
the
oak
would
naturally
be
suggested
to
primitive
people
by
the
observation
that
while
the
oak
is
deciduous
the
mistletoe
which
grows
on
it
is
evergreen
in
winter
the
sight
of
its
fresh
foliage
among
the
bare
branches
must
have
been
hailed
by
the
worshippers
of
the
tree
as
a
sign
that
the
divine
life
which
had
ceased
to
animate
the
branches
yet
survived
in
the
mistletoe
as
the
heart
of
a
sleeper
still
beats
when
his
body
is
motionless
hence
when
the
god
had
to
be
the
sacred
tree
had
to
be
was
necessary
to
begin
by
breaking
off
the
mistletoe
for
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
remained
intact
the
oak
so
people
might
think
was
invulnerable
all
the
blows
of
their
knives
and
axes
would
glance
harmless
from
its
surface
but
once
tear
from
the
oak
its
sacred
the
tree
nodded
to
its
fall
and
when
in
later
times
the
spirit
of
the
oak
came
to
be
represented
by
a
living
man
it
was
logically
necessary
to
suppose
that
like
the
tree
he
personated
he
could
neither
be
killed
nor
wounded
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
remained
uninjured
the
pulling
of
the
mistletoe
was
thus
at
once
the
signal
and
the
cause
of
his
death
on
this
view
the
invulnerable
balder
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
personification
of
a
oak
the
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
what
seems
to
have
been
an
ancient
italian
belief
that
the
mistletoe
can
be
destroyed
neither
by
fire
nor
water
for
if
the
parasite
is
thus
deemed
indestructible
it
might
easily
be
supposed
to
communicate
its
own
indestructibility
to
the
tree
on
which
it
grows
so
long
as
the
two
remain
in
conjunction
or
to
put
the
same
idea
in
mythical
form
we
might
tell
how
the
kindly
god
of
the
oak
had
his
life
securely
deposited
in
the
imperishable
mistletoe
which
grew
among
the
branches
how
accordingly
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
kept
its
place
there
the
deity
himself
remained
invulnerable
and
how
at
last
a
cunning
foe
let
into
the
secret
of
the
god
s
invulnerability
tore
the
mistletoe
from
the
oak
thereby
killing
the
and
afterwards
burning
his
body
in
a
fire
which
could
have
made
no
impression
on
him
so
long
as
the
incombustible
parasite
retained
its
seat
among
the
boughs
but
since
the
idea
of
a
being
whose
life
is
thus
in
a
sense
outside
himself
must
be
strange
to
many
readers
and
has
indeed
not
yet
been
recognized
in
its
full
bearing
on
primitive
superstition
it
will
be
worth
while
to
illustrate
it
by
examples
drawn
both
from
story
and
custom
the
result
will
be
to
shew
that
in
assuming
this
idea
as
the
explanation
of
balder
s
relation
to
the
mistletoe
i
assume
a
principle
which
is
deeply
engraved
on
the
mind
of
primitive
man
chapter
x
the
eternal
soul
in
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
in
the
opinion
of
primitive
people
the
soul
may
temporarily
absent
itself
from
the
body
without
causing
death
such
temporary
absences
of
the
soul
are
often
believed
to
involve
considerable
risk
since
the
wandering
soul
is
liable
to
a
variety
of
mishaps
at
the
hands
of
enemies
and
so
forth
but
there
is
another
aspect
to
this
power
of
disengaging
the
soul
from
the
body
if
only
the
safety
of
the
soul
can
be
ensured
during
its
absence
there
is
no
reason
why
the
soul
should
not
continue
absent
for
an
indefinite
time
indeed
a
man
may
on
a
pure
calculation
of
personal
safety
desire
that
his
soul
should
never
return
to
his
body
unable
to
conceive
of
life
abstractly
as
a
permanent
possibility
of
sensation
or
a
continuous
adjustment
of
internal
arrangements
to
external
relations
the
savage
thinks
of
it
as
a
concrete
material
thing
of
a
definite
bulk
capable
of
being
seen
and
handled
kept
in
a
box
or
jar
and
liable
to
be
bruised
fractured
or
smashed
in
pieces
it
is
not
needful
that
the
life
so
conceived
should
be
in
the
man
it
may
be
absent
from
his
body
and
still
continue
to
animate
him
by
virtue
of
a
sort
of
sympathy
or
action
at
a
distance
so
long
as
this
object
which
he
calls
his
life
or
soul
remains
unharmed
the
man
is
well
if
it
is
injured
he
suffers
if
it
is
destroyed
he
dies
or
to
put
it
otherwise
when
a
man
is
ill
or
dies
the
fact
is
explained
by
saying
that
the
material
object
called
his
life
or
soul
whether
it
be
in
his
body
or
out
of
it
has
either
sustained
injury
or
been
destroyed
but
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
if
the
life
or
soul
remains
in
the
man
it
stands
a
greater
chance
of
sustaining
injury
than
if
it
were
stowed
away
in
some
safe
and
secret
place
accordingly
in
such
circumstances
primitive
man
takes
his
soul
out
of
his
body
and
deposits
it
for
security
in
some
snug
spot
intending
to
replace
it
in
his
body
when
the
danger
is
past
or
if
he
should
discover
some
place
of
absolute
security
he
may
be
content
to
leave
his
soul
there
permanently
the
advantage
of
this
is
that
so
long
as
the
soul
remains
unharmed
in
the
place
where
he
has
deposited
it
the
man
himself
is
immortal
nothing
can
kill
his
body
since
his
life
is
not
in
it
evidence
of
this
primitive
belief
is
furnished
by
a
class
of
of
which
the
norse
story
of
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
in
his
body
is
perhaps
the
example
stories
of
this
kind
are
widely
diffused
over
the
world
and
from
their
number
and
the
variety
of
incident
and
of
details
in
which
the
leading
idea
is
embodied
we
may
infer
that
the
conception
of
an
external
soul
is
one
which
has
had
a
powerful
hold
on
the
minds
of
men
at
an
early
stage
of
history
for
are
a
faithful
reflection
of
the
world
as
it
appeared
to
the
primitive
mind
and
we
may
be
sure
that
any
idea
which
commonly
occurs
in
them
however
absurd
it
may
seem
to
us
must
once
have
been
an
ordinary
article
of
belief
this
assurance
so
far
as
it
concerns
the
supposed
power
of
disengaging
the
soul
from
the
body
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
is
amply
corroborated
by
a
comparison
of
the
in
question
with
the
actual
beliefs
and
practices
of
savages
to
this
we
shall
return
after
some
specimens
of
the
tales
have
been
given
the
specimens
will
be
selected
with
a
view
of
illustrating
both
the
characteristic
features
and
the
wide
diffusion
of
this
class
of
tales
in
the
first
place
the
story
of
the
external
soul
is
told
in
various
forms
by
all
aryan
peoples
from
hindoostan
to
the
hebrides
a
very
common
form
of
it
is
this
a
warlock
giant
or
other
fairyland
being
is
invulnerable
and
immortal
because
he
keeps
his
soul
hidden
far
away
in
some
secret
place
but
a
fair
princess
whom
he
holds
enthralled
in
his
enchanted
castle
wiles
his
secret
from
him
and
reveals
it
to
the
hero
who
seeks
out
the
warlock
s
soul
heart
life
or
death
as
it
is
variously
called
and
by
destroying
it
simultaneously
kills
the
warlock
thus
a
hindoo
story
tells
how
a
magician
called
punchkin
held
a
queen
captive
for
twelve
years
and
would
fain
marry
her
but
she
would
not
have
him
at
last
the
queen
s
son
came
to
rescue
her
and
the
two
plotted
together
to
kill
punchkin
so
the
queen
spoke
the
magician
fair
and
pretended
that
she
had
at
last
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
him
and
do
tell
me
she
said
are
you
quite
immortal
can
death
never
touch
you
and
are
you
too
great
an
enchanter
ever
to
feel
human
suffering
it
is
true
he
said
that
i
am
not
as
others
far
far
away
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
from
this
there
lies
a
desolate
country
covered
with
thick
jungle
in
the
midst
of
the
jungle
grows
a
circle
of
palm
trees
and
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
stand
six
chattees
full
of
water
piled
one
above
another
below
the
sixth
chattee
is
a
small
cage
which
contains
a
little
green
parrot
the
life
of
the
parrot
depends
my
life
if
the
parrot
is
killed
i
must
die
it
is
however
he
added
impossible
that
the
parrot
should
sustain
any
injury
both
on
account
of
the
inaccessibility
of
the
country
and
because
by
my
appointment
many
thousand
genii
surround
the
palm
trees
and
kill
all
who
approach
the
but
the
queen
s
young
son
overcame
all
difficulties
and
got
possession
of
the
parrot
he
brought
it
to
the
door
of
the
magician
s
palace
and
began
playing
with
it
punchkin
the
magician
saw
him
and
coming
out
tried
to
persuade
the
boy
to
give
him
the
parrot
give
me
my
parrot
cried
punchkin
then
the
boy
took
hold
of
the
parrot
and
tore
off
one
of
his
wings
and
as
he
did
so
the
magician
s
right
arm
fell
off
punchkin
then
stretched
out
his
left
arm
crying
give
me
my
parrot
the
prince
pulled
off
the
parrot
s
second
wing
and
the
magician
s
left
arm
tumbled
off
give
me
my
parrot
cried
he
and
fell
on
his
knees
the
prince
pulled
off
the
parrot
s
right
leg
the
magician
s
right
leg
fell
off
the
prince
pulled
off
the
parrot
s
left
leg
down
fell
the
magician
s
left
nothing
remained
of
him
except
the
trunk
and
the
head
but
still
he
rolled
his
eyes
and
cried
give
me
my
parrot
take
your
parrot
then
cried
the
boy
and
with
that
he
wrung
the
bird
s
neck
and
threw
it
at
the
magician
and
as
he
did
so
punchkin
s
head
twisted
round
and
with
a
fearful
groan
he
died

the
starling
and
smashed
the

at
the
moment
he
did
so
the
ogres
and
ogresses
perished
in
another
story
from
cashmeer
an
ogre
can
not
die
unless
a
particular
pillar
in
the
verandah
of
his
palace
be
broken
learning
the
secret
a
prince
struck
the
pillar
again
and
again
till
it
was
broken
in
pieces
and
it
was
as
if
each
stroke
had
fallen
on
the
ogre
for
he
howled
lamentably
and
shook
like
an
aspen
every
time
the
prince
hit
the
pillar
until
at
last
when
the
pillar
fell
down
the
ogre
also
fell
down
and
gave
up
the
ghost
in
another
cashmeer
tale
an
ogre
is
represented
as
laughing
very
heartily
at
the
idea
that
he
might
possibly
die
he
said
that
he
should
never
die
no
power
could
oppose
him
no
years
could
age
him
he
should
remain
ever
strong
and
ever
young
for
the
thing
wherein
his
life
dwelt
was
most
difficult
to
it
was
in
a
queen
bee
which
was
in
a
honeycomb
on
a
tree
but
the
bees
in
the
honeycomb
were
many
and
fierce
and
it
was
only
at
the
greatest
risk
that
any
one
could
catch
the
queen
however
the
hero
achieved
the
enterprise
and
crushed
the
queen
bee
and
immediately
the
ogre
fell
stone
dead
to
the
ground
so
that
the
whole
land
trembled
with
the
shock
in
some
bengalee
tales
the
life
of
a
whole
tribe
of
ogres
is
described
as
concentrated
in
two
bees
the
secret
was
thus
revealed
by
an
old
ogress
to
a
captive
princess
who
pretended
to
fear
lest
the
ogress
should
die
know
foolish
girl
said
the
ogress
that
we
ogres
never
die
we
are
not
naturally
immortal
but
our
life
depends
on
a
secret
which
no
human
being
can
unravel
let
me
tell
you
what
it
is
that
you
may
be
comforted
you
know
yonder
tank
there
is
in
the
middle
of
it
a
crystal
pillar
on
the
top
of
which
in
deep
waters
are
two
bees
if
any
human
being
can
dive
into
the
waters
and
bring
up
to
land
the
two
bees
from
the
pillar
in
one
breath
and
destroy
them
so
that
not
a
drop
of
their
blood
falls
to
the
ground
then
we
ogres
shall
certainly
die
but
if
a
single
drop
of
blood
falls
to
the
ground
then
from
it
will
start
up
a
thousand
ogres
but
what
human
being
will
find
out
this
secret
or
finding
it
will
be
able
to
achieve
the
feat
you
need
not
therefore
darling
be
sad
i
am
practically
as
usual
the
princess
reveals
the
secret
to
the
hero
who
kills
the
bees
and
that
same
moment
all
the
ogres
drop
down
dead
each
on
the
spot
where
he
happened
to
be
standing
in
another
bengalee
story
it
is
said
that
all
the
ogres
dwell
in
ceylon
and
that
all
their
lives
are
in
a
single
lemon
a
boy
cuts
the
lemon
in
pieces
and
all
the
ogres
die
in
a
siamese
or
cambodian
story
probably
derived
from
india
we
are
told
that
thossakan
or
ravana
the
king
of
ceylon
was
able
by
magic
art
to
take
his
soul
out
of
his
body
and
leave
it
in
a
box
at
home
while
he
went
to
the
wars
thus
he
was
invulnerable
in
battle
when
he
was
about
to
give
battle
to
rama
he
deposited
his
soul
with
a
hermit
called
who
was
to
keep
it
safe
for
him
so
in
the
fight
rama
was
astounded
to
see
that
his
arrows
struck
the
king
without
wounding
him
but
one
of
rama
s
allies
knowing
the
secret
of
the
king
s
invulnerability
transformed
himself
by
magic
into
the
likeness
of
the
king
and
going
to
the
hermit
asked
back
his
soul
on
receiving
it
he
soared
up
into
the
air
and
flew
to
rama
brandishing
the
box
and
squeezing
it
so
hard
that
all
the
breath
left
the
king
of
ceylon
s
body
and
he
died
in
a
bengalee
story
a
prince
going
into
a
far
country
planted
with
his
own
hands
a
tree
in
the
courtyard
of
his
father
s
palace
and
said
to
his
parents
this
tree
is
my
life
when
you
see
the
tree
green
and
fresh
then
know
that
it
is
well
with
me
when
you
see
the
tree
fade
in
some
parts
then
know
that
i
am
in
an
ill
case
and
when
you
see
the
whole
tree
fade
then
know
that
i
am
dead
and
in
another
indian
tale
a
prince
setting
forth
on
his
travels
left
behind
him
a
barley
plant
with
instructions
that
it
should
be
carefully
tended
and
watched
for
if
it
flourished
he
would
be
alive
and
well
but
if
it
drooped
then
some
mischance
was
about
to
happen
to
him
and
so
it
fell
out
for
the
prince
was
beheaded
and
as
his
head
rolled
off
the
barley
plant
snapped
in
two
and
the
ear
of
barley
fell
to
the
ground
in
the
legend
of
the
origin
of
gilgit
there
figures
a
fairy
king
whose
soul
is
in
the
snows
and
who
can
only
perish
by
fire
in
greek
tales
ancient
and
modern
the
idea
of
an
external
soul
is
not
uncommon
when
meleager
was
seven
days
old
the
fates
appeared
to
his
mother
and
told
her
that
meleager
would
die
when
the
brand
which
was
blazing
on
the
hearth
had
burnt
down
so
his
mother
snatched
the
brand
from
the
fire
and
kept
it
in
a
box
but
in
being
enraged
at
her
son
for
slaying
her
brothers
she
burnt
the
brand
in
the
fire
and
meleager
expired
in
agonies
as
if
flames
were
preying
on
his
vitals
again
nisus
king
of
megara
had
a
purple
or
golden
hair
on
the
middle
of
his
head
and
it
was
fated
that
whenever
the
hair
was
pulled
out
the
king
should
die
when
megara
was
besieged
by
the
cretans
the
king
s
daughter
scylla
fell
in
love
with
minos
their
king
and
pulled
out
the
fatal
hair
from
her
father
s
head
so
he
died
similarly
poseidon
made
pterelaus
immortal
by
giving
him
a
golden
hair
on
his
head
but
when
taphos
the
home
of
pterelaus
was
besieged
by
amphitryo
the
daughter
of
pterelaus
fell
in
love
with
amphitryo
and
killed
her
father
by
plucking
out
the
golden
hair
with
which
his
life
was
bound
up
in
a
modern
greek
a
man
s
strength
lies
in
three
golden
hairs
on
his
head
when
his
mother
pulls
them
out
he
grows
weak
and
timid
and
is
slain
by
his
enemies
another
greek
story
in
which
we
may
perhaps
detect
a
reminiscence
of
nisus
and
scylla
relates
how
a
certain
king
who
was
the
strongest
man
of
his
time
had
three
long
hairs
on
his
breast
but
when
he
went
to
war
with
another
king
and
his
own
treacherous
wife
had
cut
off
the
three
hairs
he
became
the
weakest
of
men
in
another
modern
greek
story
the
life
of
an
enchanter
is
bound
up
with
three
doves
which
are
in
the
belly
of
a
wild
boar
when
the
first
dove
is
killed
the
magician
grows
sick
when
the
second
is
killed
he
grows
very
sick
and
when
the
third
is
killed
he
dies
in
another
greek
story
of
the
same
sort
an
ogre
s
strength
is
in
three
singing
birds
which
are
in
a
wild
boar
the
hero
kills
two
of
the
birds
and
then
coming
to
the
ogre
s
house
finds
him
lying
on
the
ground
in
great
pain
he
shews
the
third
bird
to
the
ogre
who
begs
that
the
hero
will
either
let
it
fly
away
or
give
it
to
him
to
eat
but
the
hero
wrings
the
bird
s
neck
and
the
ogre
dies
on
the
spot
in
a
variant
of
the
latter
story
the
monster
s
strength
is
in
two
doves
and
when
the
hero
kills
one
of
them
the
monster
cries
out
ah
woe
is
me
half
my
life
is
gone
something
must
have
happened
to
one
of
the
when
the
second
dove
is
killed
he
dies
in
another
greek
story
the
incidents
of
the
three
golden
hairs
and
three
doves
are
artificially
combined
a
monster
has
on
his
head
three
golden
hairs
which
open
the
door
of
a
chamber

ancient
italian
legend
furnishes
a
close
parallel
to
the
greek
story
of
meleager
silvia
the
young
wife
of
septimius
marcellus
had
a
child
by
the
god
mars
the
god
gave
her
a
spear
with
which
he
said
that
the
fate
of
the
child
would
be
bound
up
when
the
boy
grew
up
he
quarrelled
with
his
maternal
uncles
and
slew
them
so
in
revenge
his
mother
burned
the
spear
on
which
his
life
depended
in
one
of
the
stories
of
the
a
certain
queen
has
a
twin
brother
a
dragon
the
astrologers
declared
at
her
birth
that
she
would
live
just
as
long
as
the
dragon
and
no
longer
the
death
of
the
one
involving
the
death
of
the
other
if
the
dragon
were
killed
the
only
way
to
restore
the
queen
to
life
would
be
to
smear
her
temples
breast
pulses
and
nostrils
with
the
blood
of
the
dragon
in
a
modern
roman
version
of
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
the
magician
tells
the
princess
whom
he
holds
captive
in
a
floating
rock
in
that
he
will
never
die
the
princess
reports
this
to
the
prince
her
husband
who
has
come
to
rescue
her
the
prince
replies
it
is
impossible
but
that
there
should
be
some
one
thing
or
other
that
is
fatal
to
him
ask
him
what
that
one
fatal
thing
so
the
princess
asked
the
magician
and
he
told
her
that
in
the
wood
was
a
hydra
with
seven
heads
in
the
middle
head
of
the
hydra
was
a
leveret
in
the
head
of
the
leveret
was
a
bird
in
the
bird
s
head
was
a
precious
stone
and
if
this
stone
were
put
under
his
pillow
he
would
die
the
prince
procured
the
stone
and
the
princess
laid
it
under
the
magician
s
pillow
no
sooner
did
the
enchanter
lay
his
head
on
the
pillow
than
he
gave
three
terrible
yells
turned
himself
round
and
round
three
times
and
died
another
italian
tale
sets
forth
how
a
great
cloud
which
was
really
a
fairy
used
to
receive
a
young
girl
as
tribute
every
year
from
a
certain
city
and
the
inhabitants
had
to
give
the
girls
up
for
if
they
did
not
the
cloud
would
throw
things
at
them
and
kill
them
all
one
year
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
king
s
daughter
to
be
handed
over
to
the
cloud
and
they
took
her
in
procession
to
the
roll
of
muffled
drums
and
attended
by
her
weeping
father
and
mother
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
left
her
sitting
in
a
chair
there
all
alone
then
the
fairy
cloud
came
down
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
set
the
princess
in
her
lap
and
began
to
suck
her
blood
out
of
her
little
finger
for
it
was
on
the
blood
of
girls
that
this
wicked
fairy
lived
when
the
poor
princess
was
faint
with
the
loss
of
blood
and
lay
like
a
log
the
cloud
carried
her
away
up
to
her
fairy
palace
in
the
sky
but
a
brave
youth
had
seen
all
that
happened
from
behind
a
bush
and
no
sooner
did
the
fairy
spirit
away
the
princess
to
her
palace
than
he
turned
himself
into
an
eagle
and
flew
after
them
he
lighted
on
a
tree
just
outside
the
palace
and
looking
in
at
the
window
he
beheld
a
room
full
of
young
girls
all
in
bed
for
these
were
the
victims
of
former
years
whom
the
fairy
cloud
had
half
killed
by
sucking
their
blood
yet
they
called
her
mamma
when
the
fairy
went
away
and
left
the
girls
the
brave
young
man
had
food
drawn
up
for
them
by
ropes
and
he
told
them
to
ask
the
fairy
how
she
might
be
killed
and
what
was
to
become
of
them
when
she
died
it
was
a
delicate
question
but
the
fairy
answered
it
saying
i
shall
never
however
when
the
girls
pressed
her
she
took
them
out
on
a
terrace
and
said
do
you
see
that
mountain
far
off
there
on
that
mountain
is
a
tigress
with
seven
heads
if
you
wish
me
to
die
a
lion
must
fight
that
tigress
and
tear
off
all
seven
of
her
heads
in
her
body
is
an
egg
and
if
any
one
hits
me
with
it
in
the
middle
of
my
forehead
i
shall
die
but
if
that
egg
falls
into
my
hands
the
tigress
will
come
to
life
again
resume
her
seven
heads
and
i
shall
when
the
young
girls
heard
this
they
pretended
to
be
glad
and
said
good
certainly
our
mamma
can
never
die
but
naturally
they
were
discouraged
however
when
she
went
away
again
they
told
it
all
to
the
young
man
and
he
bade
them
have
no
fear
away
he
went
to
the
mountain
turned
himself
into
a
lion
and
fought
the
tigress
meantime
the
fairy
came
home
saying
alas
i
feel
ill
for
six
days
the
fight
went
on
the
young
man
tearing
off
one
of
the
tigress
s
heads
each
day
and
each
day
the
strength
of
the
fairy
kept
ebbing
away
then
after
allowing
himself
two
days
rest
the
hero
tore
off
the
seventh
head
and
secured
the
egg
but
not
till
it
had
rolled
into
the
sea
and
been
brought
back
to
him
by
a
friendly
when
he
returned
to
the
fairy
with
the
egg
in
his
hand
she
begged
and
prayed
him
to
give
it
her
but
he
made
her
first
restore
the
young
girls
to
health
and
send
them
away
in
handsome
carriages
when
she
had
done
so
he
struck
her
on
the
forehead
with
the
egg
and
she
fell
down
dead
similarly
in
a
story
from
the
western
riviera
a
sorcerer
called
can
only
be
killed
by
means
of
an
egg
which
is
in
an
eagle
which
is
in
a
dog
which
is
in
a
lion
and
the
egg
must
be
broken
on
the
sorcerer
s
forehead
the
hero
who
achieves
the
adventure
has
received
the
power
of
changing
himself
into
a
lion
a
dog
an
eagle
and
an
ant
from
four
creatures
of
these
sorts
among
whom
he
had
fairly
divided
the
carcase
of
a
dead
ass
stories
of
the
same
sort
are
current
among
slavonic
peoples
in
some
of
them
as
in
the
biblical
story
of
samson
and
delilah
the
warlock
is
questioned
by
a
treacherous
woman
as
to
the
place
where
his
strength
resides
or
his
life
or
death
is
stowed
away
and
his
suspicions
being
roused
by
her
curiosity
he
at
first
puts
her
off
with
false
answers
but
is
at
last
beguiled
into
telling
her
the
truth
thereby
incurring
his
doom
through
her
treachery
thus
a
russian
story
tells
how
a
certain
warlock
called
kashtshei
or
koshchei
the
deathless
carried
off
a
princess
and
kept
her
prisoner
in
his
golden
castle
however
a
prince
made
up
to
her
one
day
as
she
was
walking
alone
and
disconsolate
in
the
castle
garden
and
cheered
by
the
prospect
of
escaping
with
him
she
went
to
the
warlock
and
coaxed
him
with
false
and
flattering
words
saying
my
dearest
friend
tell
me
i
pray
you
will
you
never
die
certainly
not
says
he
well
says
she
and
where
is
your
death
is
it
in
your
dwelling
to
be
sure
it
is
says
he
it
is
in
the
broom
under
the
thereupon
the
princess
seized
the
broom
and
threw
it
on
the
fire
but
although
the
broom
burned
the
deathless
koshchei
remained
alive
indeed
not
so
much
as
a
hair
of
him
was
singed
balked
in
her
first
attempt
the
artful
hussy
pouted
and
said
you
do
not
love
me
true
for
you
have
not
told
me
where
your
death
is
yet
i
am
not
angry
but
love
you
with
all
my
with
these
fawning
words
she
besought
the
warlock
to
tell
her
truly
where
his
death
was
so
he
laughed
and
said
why
do
you
wish
to
know
well
then
out
of
love
i
will
tell
you
where
it
lies
in
a
certain
field
there
stand
three
green
oaks
and
under
the
roots
of
the
largest
oak
is
a
worm
and
if
ever
this
worm
is
found
and
crushed
that
instant
i
shall
when
the
princess
heard
these
words
she
went
straight
to
her
lover
and
told
him
all
and
he
searched
till
he
found
the
oaks
and
dug
up
the
worm
and
crushed
it
then
he
hurried
to
the
warlock
s
castle
but
only
to
learn
from
the
princess
that
the
warlock
was
still
alive
then
she
fell
to
wheedling
and
coaxing
koshchei
once
more
and
this
time
overcome
by
her
wiles
he
opened
his
heart
to
her
and
told
her
the
truth
my
death
said
he
is
far
from
here
and
hard
to
find
on
the
wide
ocean
in
that
sea
is
an
island
and
on
the
island
there
grows
a
green
oak
and
beneath
the
oak
is
an
iron
chest
and
in
the
chest
is
a
small
basket
and
in
the
basket
is
a
hare
and
in
the
hare
is
a
duck
and
in
the
duck
is
an
egg
and
he
who
finds
the
egg
and
breaks
it
kills
me
at
the
same
the
prince
naturally
procured
the
fateful
egg
and
with
it
in
his
hands
he
confronted
the
deathless
warlock
the
monster
would
have
killed
him
but
the
prince
began
to
squeeze
the
egg
at
that
the
warlock
shrieked
with
pain
and
turning
to
the
false
princess
who
stood
by
smirking
and
smiling
was
it
not
out
of
love
for
you
said
he
that
i
told
you
where
my
death
was
and
is
this
the
return
you
make
to
me
with
that
he
grabbed
at
his
sword
which
hung
from
a
peg
on
the
wall
but
before
he
could
reach
it
the
prince
had
crushed
the
egg
and
sure
enough
the
deathless
warlock
found
his
death
at
the
same
moment
in
another
version
of
the
same
story
when
the
cunning
warlock
deceives
the
traitress
by
telling
her
that
his
death
is
in
the
broom
she
gilds
the
broom
and
at
supper
the
warlock
sees
it
shining
under
the
threshold
and
asks
her
sharply
what
s
that
oh
says
she
you
see
how
i
honour
simpleton
says
he
i
was
joking
my
death
is
out
there
fastened
to
the
oak
so
next
day
when
the
warlock
was
out
the
prince
came
and
gilded
the
whole
fence
and
in
the
evening
when
the
warlock
was
at
supper
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
fence
glittering
like
gold
and
pray
what
may
that
be
said
he
to
the
princess
you
see
said
she
how
i
respect
you
if
you
are
dear
to
me
dear
too
is
your
death
that
is
why
i
have
gilded
the
fence
in
which
your
death
the
speech
pleased
the
warlock
and
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
he
revealed
to
her
the
fatal
secret
of
the
egg
when
the
prince
with
the
help
of
some
friendly
animals
obtained
possession
of
the
egg
he
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
repaired
to
the
warlock
s
house
the
warlock
himself
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
a
very
gloomy
frame
of
mind
and
when
the
prince
appeared
and
shewed
him
the
egg
the
light
grew
dim
in
the
warlock
s
eyes
and
he
became
all
of
a
sudden
very
meek
and
mild
but
when
the
prince
began
to
play
with
the
egg
and
to
throw
it
from
one
hand
to
the
other
the
deathless
koshchei
staggered
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
when
the
prince
broke
the
egg
koshchei
the
deathless
fell
down
and
died
in
one
of
the
descriptions
of
koshchei

death
he
is
said
to
be
killed
by
a
blow
on
the

how
a
certain
warlock
called

shut
up
in

her
and
told
her
that
she
must
persuade
true
steel
to
reveal
to
her
where
his
strength
lay
so
when
true
steel
came
home
the
prince
s
wife
said
to
him
tell
me
now
where
is
your
great
strength
he
answered
my
wife
my
strength
is
in
my
then
she
began
to
pray
and
turned
to
his
sword
when
true
steel
saw
that
he
laughed
and
said
o
foolish
woman
my
strength
is
not
in
my
sword
but
in
my
bow
and
then
she
turned
towards
the
bow
and
arrows
and
prayed
but
true
steel
said
i
see
my
wife
you
have
a
clever
teacher
who
has
taught
you
to
find
out
where
my
strength
lies
i
could
almost
say
that
your
husband
is
living
and
it
is
he
who
teaches
but
she
assured
him
that
nobody
had
taught
her
when
she
found
he
had
deceived
her
again
she
waited
for
some
days
and
then
asked
him
again
about
the
secret
of
his
strength
he
answered
since
you
think
so
much
of
my
strength
i
will
tell
you
truly
where
it
is
far
away
from
here
there
is
a
very
high
mountain
in
the

there
is
a
fox
in
the
fox
there
is
a
heart
in
the
heart
there
is
a
bird
and
in
this
bird
is
my
strength
it
is
no
easy
task
however
to
catch
the
fox
for
she
can
transform
herself
into
a
multitude
of
so
next
day
when
true
steel
went
forth
from
the
cave
the
prince
came
and
learned
from
his
wife
the
true
secret
of
the
warlock
s
strength
so
away
he
hied
to
the
mountain
and
there
though
the
fox
or
rather
the
vixen
turned
herself
into
various
shapes
he
managed
with
the
help
of
certain
friendly
eagles
falcons
and
dragons
to
catch
and
kill
her
then
he
took
out
the
fox
s
heart
and
out
of
the
heart
he
took
the
bird
and
burned
it
in
a
great
fire
at
that
very
moment
true
steel
fell
down
dead
in
another
servian
story
we
read
how
a
dragon
resided
in
a
and
ate
up
two
king
s
sons
one
after
the
other
the
third
son
went
out
to
seek
his
brothers
and
coming
to
the
he
found
nobody
in
it
but
an
old
woman
she
revealed
to
him
the
dreadful
character
of
the
being
that
kept
the
mill
and
how
he
had
devoured
the
prince
s
two
elder
brothers
and
she
implored
him
to
go
away
home
before
the
same
fate
should
overtake
him
but
he
was
both
brave
and
cunning
and
he
said
to
her
listen
well
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
ask
the
dragon
whither
he
goes
and
where
his
strength
is
then
kiss
all
that
place
where
he
tells
you
his
strength
is
as
if
from
love
till
you
find
it
out
and
afterwards
tell
me
when
i
so
when
the
dragon
came
in
the
old
woman
began
to
question
him
where
in
god
s
name
have
you
been
whither
do
you
go
so
far
you
will
never
tell
me
whither
you
the
dragon
replied
well
my
dear
old
woman
i
do
go
then
the
old
woman
coaxed
him
saying
and
why
do
you
go
so
far
tell
me
where
your
strength
is
if
i
knew
where
your
strength
is
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
for
love
i
would
kiss
all
that
thereupon
the
dragon
smiled
and
said
to
her
yonder
is
my
strength
in
that
then
the
old
woman
began
to
fondle
and
kiss
the
fireplace
and
the
dragon
on
seeing
it
burst
into
a
laugh
silly
old
woman
he
said
my
strength
is
not
there
it
is
in
the
in
front
of
the
then
the
old
woman
began
to
fondle
and
kiss
the
tree
but
the
dragon
laughed
again
and
said
to
her
away
old
woman
my
strength
is
not
then
where
is
it
asked
the
old
woman
my
strength
said
he
is
a
long
way
off
and
you
can
not
go
thither
far
in
another
kingdom
under
the
king
s
city
is
a
lake
in
the
lake
is
a
dragon
in
the
dragon
is
a
boar
in
the
boar
is
a
pigeon
and
in
the
pigeon
is
my
the
murder
was
now
out
so
next
morning
when
the
dragon
went
away
from
the
mill
to
attend
to
his
usual
business
of
eating
people
up
the
prince
came
to
the
old
woman
and
she
let
him
into
the
secret
of
the
dragon
s
strength
the
prince
accordingly
set
off
to
find
the
lake
in
the
far
country
and
the
other
dragon
that
lived
in
it
he
found
them
both
at
last
the
lake
was
a
still
and
lonely
water
surrounded
by
green
meadows
where
flocks
of
sheep
nibbled
the
sweet
lush
grass
the
hero
tucked
up
his
hose
and
his
sleeves
and
wading
out
into
the
lake
called
aloud
on
the
dragon
to
come
forth
and
fight
soon
the
monster
emerged
from
the
water
slimy
and
dripping
his
scaly
back
glistening
in
the
morning
sun
the
two
grappled
and
wrestled
from
morning
to
afternoon
of
a
long
summer
day
what
with
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
the
violence
of
his
exertions
the
dragon
was
quite
exhausted
and
said
let
me
go
prince
that
i
may
moisten
my
parched
head
in
the
lake
and
toss
you
to
the
but
the
prince
sternly
refused
so
the
dragon
relaxed
his
grip
and
sank
under
the
water
which
bubbled
and
gurgled
over
the
place
where
he
plunged
into
the
depths
when
he
had
disappeared
and
the
ripples
had
subsided
on
the
surface
you
would
never
have
suspected
that
under
that
calm
water
reflecting
the
green
banks
the
white
straying
sheep
the
blue
sky
and
the
fleecy
clouds
of
a
summer
evening
there
lurked
so
ferocious
and
dangerous
a
monster
next
day
the
combat
was
renewed
with
the
very
same
result
but
on
the
third
day
the
hero
fortified
by
a
kiss
from
the
fair
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
land
tossed
the
dragon
high
in
air
and
when
the
monster
fell
with
a
most
tremendous
thud
on
the
water
he
burst
into
little
bits
out
of
the
pieces
sprang
a
boar
which
ran
away
as
fast
as
it
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
but
the
prince
sent
after
it
which
caught
it
up
and
rent
it
in
pieces
out
of
the
pieces
sprang
a
pigeon
but
the
prince
let
loose
a
falcon
which
stooped
on
the
pigeon
seized
it
in
its
talons
and
brought
it
to
the
prince
in
the
pigeon
was
the
life
of
the
dragon
who
kept
the
mill
so
before
inflicting
on
the
monster
the
doom
he
so
richly
merited
the
prince
questioned
him
as
to
the
fate
of
his
two
elder
brothers
who
had
perished
at
the
hands
or
rather
under
the
claws
and
fangs
of
the
dragon
having
ascertained
how
to
restore
them
to
life
and
to
release
a
multitude
of
other
victims
whom
the
dragon
kept
prisoners
in
a
vault
under
the
the
prince
wrung
the
pigeon
s
neck
and
that
of
course
was
the
end
of
the
dragon
and
his
unscrupulous
career
a
lithuanian
story
relates
how
a
prince
married
a
princess
and
got
with
her
a
kingdom
to
boot
she
gave
him
the
keys
of
the
castle
and
told
him
he
might
enter
every
chamber
except
one
small
room
of
which
the
key
had
a
bit
of
twine
tied
to
it
but
one
day
having
nothing
to
do
he
amused
himself
by
rummaging
in
all
the
rooms
of
the
castle
and
amongst
the
rest
he
went
into
the
little
forbidden
chamber
in
it
he
found
twelve
heads
and
a
man
hanging
on
the
hook
of
the
door
the
man
said
to
the
prince
oblige
me
by
fetching
me
a
glass
of
the
prince
fetched
it
and
the
man
drank
it
then
the
man
said
to
the
prince
oblige
me
by
releasing
me
from
the
the
prince
released
him
now
the
man
was
a
king
without
a
soul
and
he
at
once
availed
himself
of
his
liberty
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
coachman
of
the
castle
and
between
them
they
put
the
prince
s
wife
in
the
coach
and
drove
off
with
her
the
prince
rode
after
them
and
coming
up
with
the
coach
called
out
halt
soulless
king
step
out
and
fight
the
king
stepped
out
and
the
fight
began
in
a
trice
the
king
had
sliced
the
buttons
off
the
prince
s
coat
and
pinked
him
in
the
side
then
he
stepped
into
the
coach
and
drove
off
the
prince
rode
after
him
again
and
when
he
came
up
with
the
coach
he
called
out
halt
soulless
king
step
out
and
fight
the
king
stepped
out
and
they
fought
again
and
again
the
king
sliced
off
the
prince
s
buttons
and
pinked
him
in
the
side
then
after
carefully
wiping
and
sheathing
his
sword
he
said
to
his
discomfited
adversary
now
look
here
i
let
you
off
the
first
time
for
the
sake
of
the
glass
of
beer
you
gave
me
and
i
let
you
off
the
second
time
because
you
let
me
down
from
that
infernal
hook
but
if
you
fight
me
a
third
time
by
gad
i
ll
make
mince
meat
of
then
he
stepped
into
the
coach
told
the
coachman
to
drive
on
jerked
up
the
coach
window
with
a
bang
and
drove
away
like
anything
but
the
prince
galloped
after
him
and
coming
up
with
the
coach
for
the
third
time
he
called
out
halt
soulless
king
step
out
and
fight
the
king
did
step
out
and
at
it
the
two
of
them
went
tooth
and
nail
but
the
prince
had
no
chance
before
he
knew
where
he
was
the
king
ran
him
through
the
body
whisked
off
his
head
and
left
him
lying
a
heap
of
raw
mince
beside
the
road
his
wife
or
rather
his
widow
said
to
the
king
let
me
gather
up
the
fragments
that
the
king
said
so
she
made
up
the
mince
into
a
neat
parcel
deposited
it
on
the
front
seat
of
the
coach
and
away
they
drove
to
the
king
s
castle
well
to
cut
a
long
story
short
a
of
the
deceased
prince
sent
a
hawk
to
fetch
the
water
of
life
the
hawk
brought
it
in
his
beak
the
poured
the
water
on
the
fragments
of
the
prince
and
the
prince
came
to
life
again
at
once
safe
and
sound
then
he
went
to
the
king
s
castle
and
played
on
a
little
pipe
and
his
wife
heard
it
in
the
castle
and
said
that
is
how
my
husband
used
to
play
whom
the
king
cut
in
so
she
went
out
to
the
gate
and
said
to
him
are
you
my
husband
that
i
am
said
he
and
he
told
her
to
find
out
from
the
king
where
he
kept
his
soul
and
then
to
come
and
tell
him
so
she
went
to
the
king
and
said
to
him
where
my
husband
s
soul
is
there
must
mine
be
the
king
was
touched
by
this
artless
expression
of
her
love
and
he
replied
my
soul
is
in
yonder
lake
in
that
lake
lies
a
stone
in
that
stone
is
a
hare
in
the
hare
is
a
duck
in
the
duck
is
an
egg
and
in
the
egg
is
my
so
the
queen
went
and
told
her
former
husband
the
prince
and
gave
him
plenty
of
money
and
food
for
the
journey
and
off
he
set
for
the
lake
but
when
he
came
to
the
lake
he
did
not
know
in
which
part
of
it
the
stone
was
so
he
roamed
about
the
banks
and
he
was
hungry
for
he
had
eaten
up
all
the
food
then
he
met
a
dog
and
the
dog
said
to
him
don
t
shoot
me
dead
i
will
be
a
mighty
helper
to
you
in
your
time
of
so
he
let
the
dog
live
and
went
on
his
way
next
he
saw
a
tree
with
two
hawks
on
it
an
old
one
and
a
young
one
and
he
climbed
up
the
tree
to
catch
the
young
one
but
the
old
hawk
said
to
him
don
t
take
my
young
one
he
will
be
a
mighty
helper
to
you
in
your
time
of
so
the
prince
climbed
down
the
tree
and
went
on
his
way
then
he
saw
a
huge
crab
and
wished
to
break
off
one
of
his
claws
for
something
to
eat
but
the
crab
said
to
him
don
t
break
off
my
claw
it
will
be
a
mighty
helper
to
you
in
your
time
of
so
he
left
the
crab
alone
and
went
on
his
way
and
he
came
to
people
and
got
them
to
fish
up
the
stone
for
him
from
the
lake
and
to
bring
it
to
him
on
the
bank
and
there
he
broke
the
stone
in
two
and
out
of
the
stone
jumped
a
hare
but
the
dog
seized
the
hare
and
tore
him
and
out
of
the
hare
flew
a
duck
the
young
hawk
pounced
on
the
duck
and
rent
it
and
out
of
the
duck
fell
an
egg
and
the
egg
rolled
into
the
lake
but
the
crab
fetched
the
egg
out
of
the
lake
and
brought
it
to
the
prince
then
the
king
fell
ill
so
the
prince
went
to
the
king
and
said
you
killed
me
now
i
will
kill
don
t
said
the
king
i
will
said
the
prince
with
that
he
threw
the
egg
on
the
ground
and
the
king
fell
out
of
the
bed
as
dead
as
a
stone
so
the
prince
went
home
with
his
wife
and
very
happy
they
were
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
amongst
peoples
of
the
teutonic
stock
stories
of
the
external
soul
are
not
wanting
in
a
tale
told
by
the
saxons
of
transylvania
it
is
said
that
a
young
man
shot
at
a
witch
again
and
again
the
bullets
went
clean
through
her
but
did
her
no
harm
and
she
only
laughed
and
mocked
at
him
silly
earthworm
she
cried
shoot
as
much
as
you
like
it
does
me
no
harm
for
know
that
my
life
resides
not
in
me
but
far
far
away
in
a
mountain
is
a
pond
on
the
pond
swims
a
duck
in
the
duck
is
an
egg
in
the
egg
burns
a
light
that
light
is
my
life
if
you
could
put
out
that
light
my
life
would
be
at
an
end
but
that
can
never
never
however
the
young
man
got
hold
of
the
egg
smashed
it
and
put
out
the
light
and
with
it
the
witch
s
life
went
out
also
in
this
last
story
as
in
many
other
stories
of
the
same
type
the
hero
achieves
his
adventure
by
the
help
of
certain
grateful
animals
whom
he
had
met
and
done
a
service
to
on
his
travels
the
same
incident
occurs
in
another
german
tale
of
this
class
which
runs
thus
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
young
fellow
called
or
for
short
soulless
and
he
was
a
cannibal
who
would
eat
nothing
but
young
girls
now
it
was
a
custom
in
that
country
that
the
girls
drew
lots
every
year
and
the
one
on
whom
the
lot
fell
was
handed
over
to
soulless
in
time
it
happened
that
the
lot
fell
on
the
king
s
daughter
the
king
was
exceedingly
sorry
but
what
could
he
do
law
was
law
and
had
to
be
obeyed
so
they
took
the
princess
to
the
castle
where
soulless
resided
and
he
shut
her
up
in
the
larder
and
fattened
her
for
his
dinner
but
a
brave
soldier
undertook
to
rescue
her
and
off
he
set
for
the
cannibal
s
castle
well
as
he
trudged
along
what
should
he
see
but
a
fly
an
eagle
a
bear
and
a
lion
sitting
in
a
field
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
quarrelling
about
their
shares
in
a
dead
horse
so
he
divided
the
carcase
fairly
between
them
and
as
a
reward
the
fly
and
the
eagle
bestowed
on
him
the
power
of
changing
himself
at
will
into
either
of
their
shapes
that
evening
he
made
himself
into
an
eagle
and
flew
up
a
high
tree
there
he
looked
about
but
could
see
nothing
but
trees
next
morning
he
flew
on
till
he
came
to
a
great
castle
and
at
the
gate
was
a
big
black
board
with
these
words
chalked
up
on
it
mr
soulless
lives
when
the
soldier
read
that
he
was
glad
and
changed
himself
into
a
fly
and
flew
buzzing
from
window
to
window
looking
in
at
every
one
till
he
came
to
the
one
where
the
fair
princess
sat
a
prisoner
he
introduced
himself
at
once
and
said
i
am
come
to
free
you
but
first
you
must
learn
where
the
soul
of
soulless
really
i
don
t
know
replied
the
princess
but
i
will
so
after
much
coaxing
and
entreaty
she
learned
that
the
soul
of
soulless
was
in
a
box
and
that
the
box
was
on
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
red
sea
when
the
soldier
heard
that
he
turned
himself
into
an
eagle
again
flew
to
the
red
sea
and
came
back
with
the
soul
of
soulless
in
the
box
arrived
at
the
castle
he
knocked
and
banged
at
the
door
as
if
the
house
was
on
fire
soulless
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
and
he
came
down
and
opened
the
door
himself
when
he
saw
the
soldier
standing
at
it
i
can
assure
you
he
was
in
a
towering
rage
what
do
you
mean
he
roared
by
knocking
at
my
door
like
that
i
ll
gobble
you
up
on
the
spot
skin
and
hair
and
but
the
soldier
laughed
in
his
face
you
d
better
not
do
that
said
he
for
here
i
ve
got
your
soul
in
the
when
the
cannibal
heard
that
all
his
courage
went
down
into
the
calves
of
his
legs
and
he
begged
and
entreated
the
soldier
to
give
him
his
soul
but
the
soldier
would
not
hear
of
it
he
opened
the
box
took
out
the
soul
and
flung
it
over
his
head
and
that
same
instant
down
fell
the
cannibal
dead
as
a
another
german
story
which
embodies
the
notion
of
the
external
soul
in
a
somewhat
different
form
tells
how
once
upon
a
time
a
certain
king
had
three
sons
and
a
daughter
and
for
each
of
the
king
s
four
children
there
grew
a
flower
in
the
king
s
garden
which
was
a
for
it
bloomed
and
flourished
so
long
as
the
child
lived
but
drooped
and
withered
away
when
the
child
died
now
the
time
came
when
the
king
s
daughter
married
a
rich
man
and
went
to
live
with
him
far
away
but
it
was
not
long
before
her
flower
withered
in
the
king
s
garden
so
the
eldest
brother
went
forth
to
visit
his
and
comfort
him
in
his
bereavement
but
when
he
came
to
his
s
castle
he
saw
the
corpse
of
his
murdered
sister
weltering
on
the
ramparts
and
his
wicked
set
before
him
boiled
human
hands
and
feet
for
his
dinner
and
when
the
king
s
son
refused
to
eat
of
them
his
led
him
through
many
chambers
to
a
where
were
all
sorts
of
implements
of
murder
but
especially
a
gallows
a
wheel
and
a
pot
of
blood
here
he
said
to
the
prince
you
must
die
but
you
may
choose
your
kind
of
the
prince
chose
to
die
on
the
gallows
and
die
he
did
even
as
he
had
said
so
the
eldest
son
s
flower
withered
in
the
king
s
garden
and
the
second
son
went
forth
to
learn
the
fate
of
his
brother
and
sister
but
it
fared
with
him
no
better
than
with
his
elder
brother
for
he
too
died
on
the
gallows
in
the
of
his
wicked
s
castle
and
his
flower
also
withered
away
in
the
king
s
garden
at
home
now
when
the
youngest
son
was
also
come
to
his
s
castle
and
saw
the
corpse
of
his
murdered
sister
weltering
on
the
ramparts
and
the
bodies
of
his
two
murdered
brothers
dangling
from
the
gallows
in
the
he
said
that
for
his
part
he
had
a
fancy
to
die
by
the
wheel
but
he
was
not
quite
sure
how
the
thing
was
done
and
would
his
kindly
shew
him
oh
it
s
quite
easy
said
his
you
just
put
your
head
in
so
and
with
that
he
popped
his
head
through
the
middle
of
the
wheel
just
so
said
the
king
s
youngest
son
and
he
gave
the
wheel
a
twirl
and
as
it
spun
round
and
round
the
wicked
died
a
painful
death
which
he
richly
deserved
and
when
he
was
quite
dead
the
murdered
brothers
and
sister
came
to
life
again
and
their
withered
flowers
bloomed
afresh
in
the
king
s
garden
in
another
german
story
an
old
warlock
lives
with
a
damsel
all
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
and
gloomy
wood
she
fears
that
being
old
he
may
die
and
leave
her
alone
in
the
forest
but
he
reassures
her
dear
child
he
said
i
can
not
die
and
i
have
no
heart
in
my
but
she
importuned
him
to
tell
her
where
his
heart
was
so
he
said
far
far
from
here
in
an
unknown
and
lonesome
land
stands
a
great
church
the
church
is
well
secured
with
iron
doors
and
round
about
it
flows
a
broad
deep
moat
in
the
church
flies
a
bird
and
in
the
bird
is
my
heart
so
long
as
the
bird
lives
i
live
it
can
not
die
of
itself
and
no
one
can
catch
it
therefore
i
can
not
die
and
you
need
have
no
however
the
young
man
whose
bride
the
damsel
was
to
have
been
before
the
warlock
spirited
her
away
contrived
to
reach
the
church
and
catch
the
bird
he
brought
it
to
the
damsel
who
stowed
him
and
it
away
under
the
warlock
s
bed
soon
the
old
warlock
came
home
he
was
ailing
and
said
so
the
girl
wept
and
said
alas
daddy
is
dying
he
has
a
heart
in
his
breast
after
child
replied
the
warlock
hold
your
tongue
i
die
it
will
soon
pass
at
that
the
young
man
under
the
bed
gave
the
bird
a
gentle
squeeze
and
as
he
did
so
the
old
warlock
felt
very
unwell
and
sat
down
then
the
young
man
gripped
the
bird
tighter
and
the
warlock
fell
senseless
from
his
chair
now
squeeze
him
dead
cried
the
damsel
her
lover
obeyed
and
when
the
bird
was
dead
the
old
warlock
also
lay
dead
on
the
floor
in
the
norse
tale
of
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
in
his
body
the
giant
tells
the
captive
princess
far
far
away
in
a
lake
lies
an
island
on
that
island
stands
a
church
in
that
church
is
a
well
in
that
well
swims
a
duck
in
that
duck
there
is
an
egg
and
in
that
egg
there
lies
my
the
hero
of
the
tale
with
the
help
of
some
animals
to
whom
he
had
been
kind
obtains
the
egg
and
squeezes
it
at
which
the
giant
screams
piteously
and
begs
for
his
life
but
the
hero
breaks
the
egg
in
pieces
and
the
giant
at
once
bursts
in
another
norse
story
a
tells
the
captive
princess
that
she
will
never
be
able
to
return
home
unless
she
finds
the
grain
of
sand
which
lies
under
the
ninth
tongue
of
the
ninth
head
of
a
certain
dragon
but
if
that
grain
of
sand
were
to
come
over
the
rock
in
which
the
ogres
live
they
would
all
burst
and
the
rock
itself
would
become
a
gilded
palace
and
the
lake
green
the
hero
finds
the
grain
of
sand
and
takes
it
to
the
top
of
the
high
rock
in
which
the
ogres
live
so
all
the
ogres
burst
and
the
rest
falls
out
as
one
of
the
ogres
had
foretold
in
a
danish
tale
a
warlock
carries
off
a
princess
to
his
wondrous
subterranean
palace
and
when
she
anxiously
enquires
how
long
he
is
likely
to
live
he
assures
her
that
he
will
certainly
survive
her
no
man
he
says
can
rob
me
of
my
life
for
it
is
in
my
heart
and
my
heart
is
not
here
it
is
in
safer
she
urges
him
to
tell
her
where
it
is
so
he
says
very
far
from
here
in
a
land
that
is
called
poland
there
is
a
great
lake
and
in
the
lake
is
a
dragon
and
in
the
dragon
is
a
hare
and
in
the
hare
is
a
duck
and
in
the
duck
is
an
egg
and
in
the
egg
is
my
heart
it
is
in
good
keeping
you
may
trust
me
nobody
is
likely
to
stumble
upon
however
the
hero
of
the
tale
who
is
also
the
husband
of
the
kidnapped
princess
has
fortunately
received
the
power
of
turning
himself
at
will
into
a
bear
a
dog
an
ant
or
a
falcon
as
a
reward
for
having
divided
the
carcase
of
a
deer
impartially
between
four
animals
of
these
species
and
availing
himself
of
this
useful
art
he
not
only
makes
his
way
into
the
warlock
s
enchanted
palace
but
also
secures
the
egg
on
which
the
enchanter
s
life
depends
no
sooner
has
he
smashed
the
egg
on
the
enchanter
s
ugly
face
than
that
miscreant
drops
down
as
dead
as
a
herring
another
danish
story
tells
how
a
lad
went
out
into
the
world
to
look
for
service
he
met
a
man
who
hired
him
for
three
years
and
said
he
would
give
him
a
bushel
of
money
for
the
first
year
two
bushels
of
money
for
the
second
and
three
bushels
of
money
for
the
third
the
lad
was
well
content
as
you
may
believe
to
get
such
good
wages
but
the
man
was
a
magician
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
turned
the
lad
into
a
hare
by
pronouncing
over
him
some
strange
words
for
a
whole
year
the
lad
scoured
the
woods
in
the
shape
of
a
hare
and
there
was
not
a
sportsman
in
all
the
country
round
about
that
had
not
a
shot
at
him
but
not
one
of
them
could
hit
him
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
magician
spoke
some
other
words
over
him
and
turned
him
back
into
human
form
and
gave
him
the
bushel
of
money
but
then
the
magician
mumbled
some
other
words
and
the
lad
was
turned
into
a
raven
and
flew
up
into
the
sky
again
all
the
marksmen
of
the
neighbourhood
pointed
their
guns
at
him
and
banged
away
but
they
only
wasted
powder
and
shot
for
not
one
of
them
could
hit
him
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
magician
changed
him
back
into
a
man
and
gave
him
two
bushelfuls
of
money
but
soon
after
he
changed
him
into
a
fish
and
in
the
form
of
a
fish
the
young
man
jumped
into
the
brook
and
swam
down
into
the
sea
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
he
saw
a
most
beautiful
castle
all
of
glass
and
in
it
a
lovely
girl
all
alone
round
and
round
the
castle
he
swam
looking
into
all
the
rooms
and
admiring
everything
at
last
he
remembered
the
words
the
magician
had
spoken
when
he
turned
him
back
into
a
man
and
by
repeating
them
he
was
at
once
transformed
into
a
stripling
again
he
walked
into
the
glass
castle
and
introduced
himself
to
the
girl
and
though
at
first
she
was
nearly
frightened
to
death
she
was
soon
very
glad
to
have
him
with
her
from
her
he
learned
that
she
was
no
other
than
the
daughter
of
the
magician
who
kept
her
there
for
safety
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
two
now
laid
their
heads
together
and
she
told
him
what
to
do
there
was
a
certain
king
who
owed
her
father
money
and
had
not
the
wherewithal
to
pay
and
if
he
did
not
pay
by
such
and
such
a
day
his
head
was
to
be
cut
off
so
the
young
man
was
to
take
service
with
the
king
offer
him
the
bushels
of
money
which
he
had
earned
in
the
service
of
the
magician
and
go
with
him
to
the
magician
to
pay
his
debt
but
he
was
to
dress
up
as
the
court
fool
so
that
the
magician
would
not
know
him
and
in
that
character
he
was
to
indulge
in
smashing
windows
and
so
on
till
the
magician
would
fall
into
such
a
rage
that
though
the
king
had
paid
his
debt
to
the
last
farthing
he
would
nevertheless
be
condemned
to
instant
execution
unless
he
could
answer
the
magician
s
questions
the
questions
would
be
these
where
is
my
daughter
would
you
know
her
if
you
saw
her
now
the
magician
would
cause
a
whole
line
of
phantom
women
to
pass
by
so
that
the
young
man
would
not
be
able
to
tell
which
of
them
was
the
sorcerer
s
daughter
but
when
her
turn
came
to
pass
by
she
would
give
him
a
nudge
as
a
sign
and
so
he
would
know
her
then
the
magician
would
ask
and
where
is
my
heart
and
the
young
man
was
to
say
in
a
and
the
magician
would
ask
would
you
know
the
fish
if
you
saw
it
and
he
would
cause
all
sorts
of
fishes
to
pass
by
and
the
young
man
would
have
to
say
in
which
of
them
was
the
heart
of
the
magician
he
would
never
be
able
of
himself
to
tell
in
which
of
them
it
was
but
the
girl
would
stand
beside
him
and
when
the
right
fish
passed
by
she
would
nudge
him
and
he
was
to
catch
it
and
rip
it
up
and
the
magician
would
ask
him
no
more
questions
everything
turned
out
exactly
as
she
had
said
the
king
paid
his
debt
to
the
last
farthing
but
the
young
man
disguised
as
the
court
fool
cut
such
capers
and
smashed
so
many
glass
windows
and
doors
that
the
heaps
of
broken
glass
were
something
frightful
to
contemplate
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
that
the
king
who
was
of
course
responsible
for
the
pranks
of
his
fool
should
either
answer
the
magician
s
questions
or
die
the
death
while
they
were
getting
the
axe
and
the
block
ready
in
the
courtyard
the
trembling
king
was
interrogated
by
the
stern
magician
where
is
my
daughter
asked
the
sorcerer
here
the
court
fool
cut
in
and
said
she
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
would
you
know
her
if
you
saw
her
enquired
the
magician
to
be
sure
i
would
answered
the
fool
so
the
magician
caused
a
whole
regiment
of
girls
to
defile
before
him
one
after
the
other
but
they
were
mere
phantoms
and
apparitions
almost
the
last
of
all
came
the
magician
s
daughter
and
when
she
passed
the
young
man
she
pinched
his
arm
so
hard
that
he
almost
shrieked
with
pain
however
he
dissembled
his
agony
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
held
her
fast
the
magician
now
played
his
last
trump
where
is
my
heart
said
he
in
a
fish
said
the
fool
would
you
know
the
fish
if
you
saw
it
asked
the
magician
to
be
sure
i
would
answered
the
fool
then
all
the
fishes
of
the
sea
swam
past
and
when
the
right
one
came
last
of
all
the
girl
nudged
her
lover
he
seized
the
fish
and
with
one
stroke
of
his
knife
slit
it
from
end
to
end
out
tumbled
the
magician
s
heart
the
young
man
seized
it
and
cut
it
in
two
and
at
the
same
moment
the
magician
fell
dead
in
iceland
they
say
that
once
a
king
s
son
was
out
hunting
in
a
wood
with
the
courtiers
when
the
mist
came
down
so
thick
that
his
companions
lost
sight
of
the
prince
and
though
they
searched
the
woods
till
evening
they
could
not
find
him
at
the
news
the
king
was
inconsolable
and
taking
to
his
bed
caused
proclamation
to
be
made
that
he
who
could
find
and
bring
back
his
lost
son
should
have
half
the
kingdom
now
an
old
man
and
his
old
wife
lived
together
in
a
wretched
hut
and
they
had
a
daughter
she
resolved
to
seek
the
lost
prince
and
get
the
promised
reward
so
her
parents
gave
her
food
for
the
journey
and
a
pair
of
new
shoes
and
off
she
set
well
she
walked
and
better
walked
for
days
and
at
last
she
came
towards
evening
to
a
cave
and
going
into
it
she
saw
two
beds
one
of
them
was
covered
with
a
cloth
of
silver
and
the
other
with
a
cloth
of
gold
and
in
the
bed
with
the
golden
coverlet
was
the
king
s
son
fast
asleep
she
tried
to
wake
him
but
all
in
vain
then
she
noticed
some
runes
carved
on
the
bedsteads
but
she
could
not
read
them
so
she
went
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
hid
behind
the
door
hardly
had
she
time
to
conceal
herself
when
she
heard
a
loud
noise
and
saw
two
giantesses
two
great
hulking
louts
they
were
stride
into
the
cave
no
sooner
were
they
in
than
one
said
to
the
other
ugh
what
a
smell
of
human
flesh
in
our
cave
but
the
other
thought
the
smell
might
come
from
the
king
s
son
they
went
up
to
the
bed
where
he
was
sleeping
and
calling
two
swans
which
the
girl
had
not
perceived
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cave
they
said
sing
my
swans
the
king
s
son
may
so
the
swans
sang
and
the
king
s
son
awoke
the
younger
of
the
two
hags
offered
him
food
but
he
refused
it
then
she
asked
him
if
he
would
marry
her
but
he
said
no
certainly
then
she
shrieked
and
said
to
the
swans
sing
my
swans
the
king
s
son
may
the
swans
sang
and
the
king
s
son
fell
fast
asleep
then
the
two
giantesses
lay
down
in
the
bed
with
the
silver
coverlet
and
slept
till
break
of
day
when
they
woke
in
the
morning
they
wakened
the
prince
and
offered
him
food
again
but
he
again
refused
it
and
the
younger
hag
again
asked
him
if
he
would
have
her
to
wife
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it
so
they
put
him
to
sleep
again
to
the
singing
of
the
swans
and
left
the
cave
when
they
were
gone
a
while
the
girl
came
forth
from
her
and
waked
the
king
s
son
to
the
song
of
the
swans
and
he
was
glad
to
see
her
and
to
get
the
news
she
told
him
that
when
the
hag
asked
him
again
to
marry
her
he
must
say
yes
but
you
must
first
tell
me
what
is
written
on
the
beds
and
what
you
do
by
so
when
it
drew
to
evening
the
girl
hid
herself
again
and
soon
the
giantesses
came
lit
a
fire
in
the
cave
and
cooked
at
it
the
game
they
had
brought
with
them
and
the
younger
hag
wakened
the
king
s
son
and
asked
him
if
he
would
have
something
to
eat
this
time
he
said
and
when
he
had
finished
his
supper
the
giantess
asked
him
if
he
would
have
her
to
wife
that
i
will
said
he
but
first
you
must
tell
me
what
the
runes
mean
that
are
carved
on
the
she
said
that
they
meant
run
my
little
bed
whither
i
he
said
he
was
very
glad
to
know
it
but
she
must
also
tell
him
what
they
did
all
day
long
out
there
in
the
wood
the
hag
told
him
that
they
hunted
beasts
and
birds
and
that
between
whiles
they
sat
down
under
an
oak
and
threw
their
from
one
to
the
other
but
they
had
to
be
careful
for
if
the
egg
were
to
break
they
would
both
die
the
king
s
son
thanked
her
kindly
but
next
morning
when
the
giantess
asked
him
to
go
with
them
to
the
wood
he
said
that
he
would
rather
stay
at
home
so
away
went
the
giantesses
by
themselves
after
they
had
lulled
him
to
sleep
to
the
singing
of
the
swans
but
hardly
were
their
backs
turned
when
out
came
the
girl
and
wakened
the
prince
and
told
him
to
take
his
spear
and
they
would
pursue
the
giantesses
and
when
they
were
throwing
their
to
each
other
he
was
to
hurl
his
spear
at
it
and
smash
it
to
bits
but
if
you
miss
said
she
it
is
as
much
as
your
life
is
so
they
came
to
the
oak
in
the
wood
and
there
they
heard
a
loud
laugh
and
the
king
s
son
climbed
up
the
tree
and
there
under
the
oak
were
the
two
giantesses
and
one
of
them
had
a
golden
egg
in
her
hand
and
threw
it
to
the
other
just
then
the
king
s
son
hurled
his
spear
and
hit
the
egg
so
that
it
burst
at
the
same
time
the
two
hags
fell
dead
to
the
ground
and
the
slaver
dribbled
out
of
their
mouths
in
an
icelandic
parallel
to
the
story
of
meleager
the
or
sibyls
come
and
foretell
the
high
destiny
of
the
infant
gestr
as
he
lies
in
his
cradle
two
candles
were
burning
beside
the
child
and
the
youngest
of
the
conceiving
herself
slighted
cried
out
i
foretell
that
the
child
shall
live
no
longer
than
this
candle
whereupon
the
chief
sibyl
put
out
the
candle
and
gave
it
to
gestr
s
mother
to
keep
charging
her
not
to
light
it
again
until
her
son
should
wish
to
die
gestr
lived
three
hundred
years
then
he
kindled
the
candle
and
expired
the
conception
of
the
external
soul
meets
us
also
in
celtic
stories
thus
a
tale
told
by
a
blind
fiddler
in
the
island
of
islay
relates
how
a
giant
carried
off
a
king
s
wife
and
his
two
horses
and
kept
them
in
his
den
but
the
horses
attacked
the
giant
and
mauled
him
so
that
he
could
hardly
crawl
he
said
to
the
queen
if
i
myself
had
my
soul
to
keep
those
horses
would
have
killed
me
long
and
where
my
dear
said
she
is
thy
soul
by
the
books
i
will
take
care
of
it
is
in
the
bonnach
stone
said
he
so
on
the
morrow
when
the
giant
went
out
the
queen
set
the
bonnach
stone
in
order
exceedingly
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
giant
came
back
and
he
said
to
the
queen
what
made
thee
set
the
bonnach
stone
in
order
like
that
because
thy
soul
is
in
it
quoth
she
i
perceive
said
he
that
if
thou
didst
know
where
my
soul
is
thou
wouldst
give
it
much
that
i
would
said
she
it
is
not
there
said
he
my
soul
is
it
is
in
the
on
the
morrow
she
set
the
threshold
in
order
finely
and
when
the
giant
returned
he
asked
her
what
brought
thee
to
set
the
threshold
in
order
like
that
because
thy
soul
is
in
it
said
she
i
perceive
said
he
that
if
thou
knewest
where
my
soul
is
thou
wouldst
take
care
of
that
i
would
said
she
it
is
not
there
that
my
soul
is
said
he
there
is
a
great
flagstone
under
the
threshold
there
is
a
wether
under
the
flag
there
is
a
duck
in
the
wether
s
belly
and
an
egg
in
the
belly
of
the
duck
and
it
is
in
the
egg
that
my
soul
on
the
morrow
when
the
giant
was
gone
they
raised
the
flagstone
and
out
came
the
wether
they
opened
the
wether
and
out
came
the
duck
they
split
the
duck
and
out
came
the
egg
and
the
queen
took
the
egg
and
crushed
it
in
her
hands
and
at
that
very
moment
the
giant
who
was
coming
home
in
the
dusk
fell
down
dead
in
another
celtic
tale
a
sea
beast
has
carried
off
a
king
s
daughter
and
an
old
smith
declares
that
there
is
no
way
of
killing
the
beast
but
one
in
the
island
that
is
in
the
midst
of
the
loch
is
eillid
hind
of
the
slenderest
legs
and
the
swiftest
step
and
though
she
should
be
caught
there
would
spring
a
hoodie
out
of
her
and
though
the
hoodie
should
be
caught
there
would
spring
a
trout
out
of
her
but
there
is
an
egg
in
the
mouth
of
the
trout
and
the
soul
of
the
beast
is
in
the
egg
and
if
the
egg
breaks
the
beast
is
as
usual
the
egg
is
broken
and
the
beast
dies
in
these
celtic
tales
the
helpful
animals
reappear
and
assist
the
hero
in
achieving
the
adventure
though
for
the
sake
of
brevity
i
have
omitted
to
describe
the
parts
they
play
in
the
plot
they
figure
also
in
an
argyleshire
story
which
seems
however
to
be
of
irish
origin
for
the
cruachan
of
which
we
hear
in
it
is
not
the
rugged
and
lofty
mountain
ben
cruachan
which
towers
above
the

and
set
off
in

of
his
wife
and
the
filly
he
went

a
long
long
time
till
at

his

were
blackened
and
his
cheeks
were
sunken
the
birds
were
going
to
rest
at
the
roots
of
the
bushes
and
the
tops
of
the
thickets
and
the
dark
clouds
of
night
were
coming
and
the
clouds
of
day
were
departing
and
he
saw
a
house
far
from
him
but
though
it
was
far
from
him
he
did
not
take
long
to
reach
it
he
went
in
and
sat
in
the
upper
end
of
the
house
but
there
was
no

within
and
the
fire
was
newly

he
would
take

well
believe
it
said
he
then
she
gave
him
food
and
drink
and
sent
him
to

she
rose
in
the
morning
made
breakfast
for
him
and
baked
a
bannock
for
him
to
take
with
him
on
his
journey
and
he
went
away
and
travelled
all
day
and
in
the
evening
he
came
to
another
house
and
went
in
and
was
entertained
by
the
duck
who
told
him
that
the
giant
had
rested
there
the
night
before
with
the
wife
and
shaggy
dun
filly
of
the
herdsman
of
cruachan
and
next
day
the
herdsman
journeyed
again
and
at
evening
he
came
to
another
house
and
went
in
and
was
entertained
by
the
fox
of
the
scrubwood
who
told
him
just
what
the
hawk
of
glencuaich
and
the
duck
had
told
him
before
next
day
the
same
thing
happened
only
it
was
the
brown
otter
of
the
burn
that
entertained
him
at
evening
in
a
house
where
the
fire
was
newly
kindled
the
floor
newly
swept
and
the
bed
newly
made
and
next
morning
when
he
awoke
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
hawk
of
glencuaich
the
duck
the
fox
of
the
scrubwood
and
the
brown
otter
of
the
burn
all
dancing
together
on
the
floor
they
made
breakfast
for
him
and
partook
of
it
all
together
and
said
to
him
should
you
be
at
any
time
in
straits
think
of
us
and
we
will
help
well
that
very
evening
he
came
to
the
cave
where
the
giant
lived
and
who
was
there
before
him
but
his
own
wife
she
gave
him
food
and
hid
him
under
clothes
at
the
upper
end
of
the
cave
and
when
the
giant
came
home
he
sniffed
about
and
said
the
smell
of
a
stranger
is
in
the
but
she
said
no
it
was
only
a
little
bird
she
had
roasted
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
said
she
where
you
keep
your
life
that
i
might
take
good
care
of
it
is
in
a
grey
stone
over
there
said
he
so
next
day
when
he
went
away
she
took
the
grey
stone
and
dressed
it
well
and
placed
it
in
the
upper
end
of
the
cave
when
the
giant
came
home
in
the
evening
he
said
to
her
what
is
it
that
you
have
dressed
there
your
own
life
said
she
and
we
must
be
careful
of
i
perceive
that
you
are
very
fond
of
me
but
it
is
not
there
said
he
where
is
it
said
she
it
is
in
a
grey
sheep
on
yonder
hillside
said
he
on
the
morrow
when
he
went
away
she
got
the
grey
sheep
dressed
it
well
and
placed
it
in
the
upper
end
of
the
cave
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
he
said
what
is
it
that
you
have
dressed
there
your
own
life
my
love
said
she
it
is
not
there
as
yet
said
he
well
said
she
you
are
putting
me
to
great
trouble
taking
care
of
it
and
you
have
not
told
me
the
truth
these
two
he
then
said
i
think
that
i
may
tell
it
to
you
now
my
life
is
below
the
feet
of
the
big
horse
in
the
stable
there
is
a
place
down
there
in
which
there
is
a
small
lake
over
the
lake
are
seven
grey
hides
and
over
the
hides
are
seven
sods
from
the
heath
and
under
all
these
are
seven
oak
planks
there
is
a
trout
in
the
lake
and
a
duck
in
the
belly
of
the
trout
an
egg
in
the
belly
of
the
duck
and
a
thorn
of
blackthorn
inside
of
the
egg
and
till
that
thorn
is
chewed
small
i
can
not
be
killed
whenever
the
seven
grey
hides
the
seven
sods
from
the
heath
and
the
seven
oak
planks
are
touched
i
shall
feel
it
wherever
i
shall
be
i
have
an
axe
above
the
door
and
unless
all
these
are
cut
through
with
one
blow
of
it
the
lake
will
not
be
reached
and
when
it
will
be
reached
i
shall
feel
next
day
when
the
giant
had
gone
out
hunting
on
the
hill
the
herdsman
of
cruachan
contrived
with
the
help
of
the
friendly
hawk
the
duck
the
fox
and
the
get
possession
of
the
fateful
thorn
and
to
chew
it
before
the
giant
could
reach
him
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
the
giant
dropped
stark
and
stiff
a
corpse
another
argyleshire
story
relates
how
a
certain
giant
who
lived
in
the
black
corrie
of
ben
breck
carried
off
three
daughters
of
a
king
one
after
the
other
at
intervals
of
seven
years
the
bereaved
monarch
sent
champions
to
rescue
his
lost
daughters
but
though
they
surprised
the
giant
in
his
sleep
and
cut
off
his
head
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
for
as
fast
as
they
cut
it
off
he
put
it
on
again
and
made
after
them
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
the
champions
fled
away
before
him
as
fast
as
they
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
and
the
more
agile
of
them
escaped
but
the
he
caught
bared
them
to
the
skin
and
hanged
them
on
hooks
against
the
turrets
of
his
castle
so
he
went
by
the
name
of
the
hangman
now
this
amiable
man
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
fetch
away
the
fourth
and
last
of
the
king
s
daughters
when
another
seven
years
should
be
up
the
time
was
drawing
near
and
the
king
with
the
natural
instincts
of
a
father
was
in
great
tribulation
when
as
good
luck
would
have
it
a
son
of
the
king
of
ireland
by
name
alastir
arrived
in
the
king
s
castle
and
undertook
to
find
out
where
the
hangman
had
hidden
his
soul
to
cut
a
long
story
short
the
artful
hangman
had
hidden
his
soul
in
an
egg
which
was
in
the
belly
of
a
duck
which
was
in
the
belly
of
a
salmon
which
was
in
the
belly
of
a
hind
of
the
cliffs
the
prince
wormed
the
secret
from
a
little
old
man
and
by
the
help
of
a
dog
a
brown
otter
and
a
falcon
he
contrived
to
extract
the
egg
from
its
various
envelopes
and
crushed
it
to
bits
between
his
hands
and
knees
so
when
he
came
to
the
giant
s
castle
he
found
the
hangman
lying
dead
on
the
floor
another
highland
story
sets
forth
how
hugh
prince
of
lochlin
was
long
held
captive
by
a
giant
who
lived
in
a
cave
overlooking
the
sound
of
mull
at
last
after
he
had
spent
many
years
of
captivity
in
that
dismal
cave
it
came
to
pass
that
one
night
the
giant
and
his
wife
had
a
great
dispute
and
hugh
overheard
their
talk
and
learned
that
the
giant
s
soul
was
in
a
precious
gem
which
he
always
wore
on
his
forehead
so
the
prince
watched
his
opportunity
seized
the
gem
and
having
no
means
of
escape
or
concealment
hastily
swallowed
it
like
lightning
from
the
clouds
the
giant
s
sword
flashed
from
its
scabbard
and
flew
between
hugh
s
head
and
his
body
to
intercept
the
gem
before
it
could
descend
into
the
prince
s
stomach
but
it
was
too
late
and
the
giant
fell
down
sword
in
hand
and
expired
without
a
gasp
hugh
had
now
lost
his
head
it
is
true
but
having
the
giant
s
soul
in
his
body
he
felt
none
the
worse
for
the
accident
so
he
buckled
the
giant
s
sword
at
his
side
mounted
the
grey
filly
swifter
than
the
east
wind
that
never
had
a
bridle
and
rode
home
but
the
want
of
his
head
made
a
painful
impression
on
his
friends
indeed
they
maintained
that
he
was
a
ghost
and
shut
the
door
in
his
face
so
now
he
wanders
for
ever
in
shades
of
darkness
riding
the
grey
filly
fleeter
than
the
wind
on
stormy
nights
when
the
wind
howls
about
the
gables
and
among
the
trees
you
may
see
him
galloping
along
the
shore
of
the
sea
between
wave
and
many
a
naughty
little
boy
who
would
not
go
quietly
to
bed
has
been
carried
off
by
headless
hugh
on
his
grey
filly
and
never
seen
again
in
sutherlandshire
at
the
present
day
there
is
a
sept
of
mackays
known
as
the
descendants
of
the
seal
who
claim
to
be
sprung
from
a
mermaid
and
the
story
they
tell
in
explanation
of
their
claim
involves
the
notion
of
the
external
soul
they
say
that
the
laird
of
borgie
used
to
go
down
to
the
rocks
under
his
castle
to
bathe
one
day
he
saw
a
mermaid
close
in
shore
combing
her
hair
and
swimming
about
as
if
she
were
anxious
to
land
after
watching
her
for
a
time
he
noticed
her
cowl
on
the
rocks
beside
him
and
knowing
that
she
could
not
go
to
sea
without
it
he
carried
the
cowl
up
to
the
castle
in
the
hope
that
she
would
follow
him
she
did
so
but
he
refused
to
give
up
the
cowl
and
detained
the
herself
and
made
her
his
wife
to
this
she
consented
with
great
reluctance
and
told
him
that
her
life
was
bound
up
with
the
cowl
and
that
if
it
rotted
or
was
destroyed
she
would
instantly
die
so
the
cowl
was
placed
for
safety
in
the
middle
of
a
great
and
there
it
lay
for
years
one
unhappy
day
when
the
laird
was
from
home
the
servants
were
working
among
the
hay
and
found
the
cowl
not
knowing
what
it
was
they
shewed
it
to
the
lady
of
the
house
the
sight
revived
memories
of
her
old
life
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
so
she
took
the
cowl
and
leaving
her
child
in
its
cot
plunged
into
the
sea
and
never
came
home
to
borgie
any
more
only
sometimes
she
would
swim
close
in
shore
to
see
her
boy
and
then
she
wept
because
he
was
not
of
her
own
kind
that
she
might
take
him
to
sea
with
her
the
boy
grew
to
be
a
man
and
his
descendants
are
famous
swimmers
they
can
not
drown
and
to
this
day
they
are
known
in
the
neighbourhood
as
an
that
is
the
descendants
of
the
in
an
irish
story
we
read
how
a
giant
kept
a
beautiful
damsel
a
prisoner
in
his
castle
on
the
top
of
a
hill
which
was
white
with
the
bones
of
the
champions
who
had
tried
in
vain
to
rescue
the
fair
captive
at
last
the
hero
after
hewing
and
slashing
at
the
giant
all
to
no
purpose
discovered
that
the
only
way
to
kill
him
was
to
rub
a
mole
on
the
giant
s
right
breast
with
a
certain
egg
which
was
in
a
duck
which
was
in
a
chest
which
lay
locked
and
bound
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
with
the
help
of
some
obliging
salmon
rams
and
eagles
the
hero
as
usual
made
himself
master
of
the
precious
egg
and
slew
the
giant
by
merely
striking
it
against
the
mole
on
his
right
breast
similarly
in
a
breton
story
there
figures
a
giant
whom
neither
fire
nor
water
nor
steel
can
harm
he
tells
his
seventh
wife
whom
he
has
just
married
after
murdering
all
her
predecessors
i
am
immortal
and
no
one
can
hurt
me
unless
he
crushes
on
my
breast
an
egg
which
is
in
a
pigeon
which
is
in
the
belly
of
a
hare
this
hare
is
in
the
belly
of
a
wolf
and
this
wolf
is
in
the
belly
of
my
brother
who
dwells
a
thousand
leagues
from
here
so
i
am
quite
easy
on
that
a
soldier
the
hero
of
the
tale
had
been
of
service
to
an
ant
a
wolf
and
a
who
in
return
bestowed
on
him
the
power
of
turning
himself
into
an
ant
a
wolf
or
a
at
will
by
means
of
this
magical
power
the
soldier
contrived
to
obtain
the
egg
and
crush
it
on
the
breast
of
the
giant
who
immediately
expired
another
breton
story
tells
of
a
giant
who
was
called
because
his
life
did
not
reside
in
his
body
he
himself
dwelt
in
a
beautiful
castle
which
hung
between
heaven
and
earth
suspended
by
four
golden
chains
but
his
life
was
in
an
egg
and
the
egg
was
in
a
dove
and
the
dove
was
in
a
hare
and
the
hare
was
in
a
wolf
and
the
wolf
was
in
an
iron
chest
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
his
castle
in
the
air
he
kept
prisoner
a
beauteous
princess
whom
he
had
swooped
down
upon
and
carried
off
in
a
magic
chariot
but
her
lover
turned
himself
into
an
ant
and
so
climbed
up
one
of
the
golden
chains
into
the
enchanted
castle
for
he
had
done
a
kindness
to
the
king
and
queen
of
ants
and
they
rewarded
him
by
transforming
him
into
an
ant
in
his
time
of
need
when
he
had
learned
from
the
captive
princess
the
secret
of
the
giant
s
life
he
procured
the
chest
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
by
the
help
of
the
king
of
fishes
whom
he
had
also
obliged
and
opening
the
chest
he
killed
first
the
wolf
then
the
hare
and
then
the
dove
and
at
the
death
of
each
animal
the
giant
grew
weaker
and
weaker
as
if
he
had
lost
a
limb
in
the
stomach
of
the
dove
the
hero
found
the
egg
on
which
the
giant
s
life
depended
and
when
he
came
with
it
to
the
castle
he
found
stretched
on
his
bed
at
the
point
of
death
so
he
dashed
the
egg
against
the
giant
s
forehead
the
egg
broke
and
the
giant
straightway
expired
in
another
breton
tale
the
life
of
a
giant
resides
in
an
old
which
grows
in
his
castle
garden
and
to
kill
him
it
is
necessary
to
sever
the
of
the
tree
at
a
single
blow
of
an
axe
without
injuring
any
of
the
lesser
roots
this
task
the
hero
as
usual
successfully
accomplishes
and
at
the
same
moment
the
giant
drops
dead
the
notion
of
an
external
soul
has
now
been
traced
in
told
by
aryan
peoples
from
india
to
brittany
and
the
hebrides
we
have
still
to
shew
that
the
same
idea
occurs
commonly
in
the
popular
stories
of
peoples
who
do
not
belong
to
the
aryan
stock
in
the
first
place
it
appears
in
the
ancient
egyptian
story
of
the
two
this
story
was
written
down
in
the
reign
of
rameses
about
it
is
therefore
older
than
our
present
redaction
of
homer
and
far
older
than
the
bible
the
outline
of
the
story
so
far
as
it
concerns
us
here
is
as
follows
once
upon
a
time
there
were
two
brethren
the
name
of
the
elder
was
anpu
and
the
name
of
the
younger
was
bata
now
anpu
had
a
house
and
a
wife
and
his
younger
brother
dwelt
with
him
as
his
servant
it
was
anpu
who
made
the
garments
and
every
morning
when
it
grew
light
he
drove
the
kine
afield
as
he
walked
behind
them
they
used
to
say
to
him
the
grass
is
good
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
he
heard
what
they
said
and
led
them
to
the
good
pasture
that
they
desired
so
his
kine
grew
very
sleek
and
multiplied
greatly
one
day
when
the
two
brothers
were
at
work
in
the
field
the
elder
brother
said
to
the
younger
run
and
fetch
seed
from
the
so
the
younger
brother
ran
and
said
to
the
wife
of
his
elder
brother
give
me
seed
that
i
may
run
to
the
field
for
my
brother
sent
me
saying
tarry
she
said
go
to
the
barn
and
take
as
much
as
thou
he
went
and
filled
a
jar
full
of
wheat
and
barley
and
came
forth
bearing
it
on
his
shoulders
when
the
woman
saw
him
her
heart
went
out
to
him
and
she
laid
hold
of
him
and
said
come
let
us
rest
an
hour
but
he
said
thou
art
to
me
as
a
mother
and
my
brother
is
to
me
as
a
so
he
would
not
hearken
to
her
but
took
the
load
on
his
back
and
went
away
to
the
field
in
the
evening
when
the
elder
brother
was
returning
from
the
field
his
wife
feared
for
what
she
had
said
so
she
took
soot
and
made
herself
as
one
who
had
been
beaten
and
when
her
husband
came
home
she
said
when
thy
younger
brother
came
to
fetch
seed
he
said
to
me
come
let
us
rest
an
hour
together
but
i
would
not
and
he
beat
then
the
elder
brother
became
like
a
panther
of
the
south
he
sharpened
his
knife
and
stood
behind
the
door
of
the
and
when
the
sun
set
and
the
younger
brother
came
laden
with
all
the
herbs
of
the
field
as
was
his
wont
every
day
the
cow
that
walked
in
front
of
the
herd
said
to
him
behold
thine
elder
brother
stands
with
a
knife
to
kill
thee
flee
before
when
he
heard
what
the
cow
said
he
looked
under
the
door
of
the
and
saw
the
feet
of
his
elder
brother
standing
behind
the
door
his
knife
in
his
hand
so
he
fled
and
his
brother
pursued
him
with
the
knife
but
the
younger
brother
cried
for
help
to
the
sun
and
the
sun
heard
him
and
caused
a
great
water
to
spring
up
between
him
and
his
elder
brother
and
the
water
was
full
of
crocodiles
the
two
brothers
stood
the
one
on
the
one
side
of
the
water
and
the
other
on
the
other
and
the
younger
brother
told
the
elder
brother
all
that
had
befallen
so
the
elder
brother
repented
him
of
what
he
had
done
and
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
but
he
could
not
come
at
the
farther
bank
by
reason
of
the
crocodiles
his
younger
brother
called
to
him
and
said
go
home
and
tend
the
cattle
thyself
for
i
will
dwell
no
more
in
the
place
where
thou
art
i
will
go
to
the
valley
of
the
acacia
but
this
is
what
thou
shalt
do
for
me
thou
shalt
come
and
care
for
me
if
evil
befalls
me
for
i
will
enchant
my
heart
and
place
it
on
the
top
of
the
flower
of
the
acacia
and
if
they
cut
the
acacia
and
my
heart
falls
to
the
ground
thou
shalt
come
and
seek
it
and
when
thou
hast
found
it
thou
shalt
lay
it
in
a
vessel
of
fresh
water
then
i
shall
come
to
life
again
but
this
is
the
sign
that
evil
has
befallen
me
the
pot
of
beer
in
thine
hand
shall
so
he
went
away
to
the
valley
of
the
acacia
but
his
brother
returned
home
with
dust
on
his
head
and
slew
his
wife
and
cast
her
to
the
dogs
for
many
days
afterwards
the
younger
brother
dwelt
alone
in
the
valley
of
the
acacia
by
day
he
hunted
the
beasts
of
the
field
but
at
evening
he
came
and
laid
him
down
under
the
acacia
on
the
top
of
whose
flower
was
his
heart
and
many
days
after
that
he
built
himself
a
house
in
the
valley
of
the
acacia
but
the
gods
were
grieved
for
him
and
the
sun
said
to
khnumu
make
a
wife
for
bata
that
he
may
not
dwell
so
khnumu
made
him
a
woman
to
dwell
with
him
who
was
perfect
in
her
limbs
more
than
any
woman
on
earth
for
all
the
gods
were
in
her
so
she
dwelt
with
him
but
one
day
a
lock
of
her
hair
fell
into
the
river
and
floated
down
to
the
land
of
egypt
to
the
house
of
pharaoh
s
washerwomen
the
fragrance
of
the
lock
perfumed
pharaoh
s
raiment
and
the
washerwomen
were
blamed
for
it
was
said
an
odour
of
perfume
in
the
garments
of
pharaoh
so
the
heart
of
pharaoh
s
chief
washerman
was
weary
of
the
complaints
that
were
made
every
day
and
he
went
to
the
wharf
and
there
in
the
water
he
spied
the
lock
of
hair
he
sent
one
down
into
the
river
to
fetch
it
and
because
it
smelt
sweetly
he
took
it
to
pharaoh
then
pharaoh
s
magicians
were
sent
for
and
they
said
this
lock
of
hair
belongs
to
a
daughter
of
the
sun
who
has
in
her
the
essence
of
all
the
gods
let
messengers
go
forth
to
all
foreign
lands
to
seek
so
the
woman
was
brought
from
the
valley
of
the
acacia
with
chariots
and
archers
and
much
people
and
all
the
land
of
egypt
rejoiced
at
her
coming
and
pharaoh
loved
her
but
when
they
asked
her
of
her
husband
she
said
to
pharaoh
let
them
cut
down
the
acacia
and
let
them
destroy
so
men
were
sent
with
tools
to
cut
down
the
acacia
they
came
to
it
and
cut
the
flower
upon
which
was
the
heart
of
bata
and
he
fell
down
dead
in
that
evil
hour
but
the
next
day
when
the
earth
grew
light
and
the
elder
brother
of
bata
was
entered
into
his
house
and
had
sat
down
they
brought
him
a
pot
of
beer
and
it
bubbled
and
they
gave
him
a
jug
of
wine
and
it
grew
turbid
then
he
took
his
staff
and
his
sandals
and
hied
him
to
the
valley
of
the
acacia
and
there
he
found
his
younger
brother
lying
dead
in
his
house
so
he
sought
for
the
heart
of
his
brother
under
the
acacia
for
three
years
he
sought
in
vain
but
in
the
fourth
year
he
found
it
in
the
berry
of
the
acacia
so
he
threw
the
heart
into
a
cup
of
fresh
water
and
when
it
was
night
and
the
heart
had
sucked
in
much
water
bata
shook
in
all
his
limbs
and
revived
then
he
drank
the
cup
of
water
in
which
his
heart
was
and
his
heart
went
into
its
place
and
he
lived
as
before
in
the
we
read
how
seyf
after
wandering
for
four
months
over
mountains
and
hills
and
deserts
came
to
a
lofty
palace
in
which
he
found
the
lovely
daughter
of
the
king
of
india
sitting
alone
on
a
golden
couch
in
a
hall
spread
with
silken
carpets
she
tells
him
that
she
is
held
captive
by
a
jinnee
who
had
swooped
down
on
her
and
carried
her
off
while
she
was
disporting
herself
with
her
female
slaves
in
a
tank
in
the
great
garden
of
her
father
the
king
seyf
then
offers
to
smite
the
jinnee
with
the
sword
and
slay
him
but
she
replied
thou
canst
not
slay
him
unless
thou
kill
his
and
in
what
place
said
he
is
his
soul
she
answered
i
asked
him
respecting
it
many
times
but
he
would
not
confess
to
me
its
place
it
happened
however
that
i
urged
him
one
day
and
he
was
enraged
against
me
and
said
to
me
how
often
wilt
thou
ask
me
respecting
my
soul
what
is
the
reason
of
thy
question
respecting
my
soul
so
i
answered
him
o
hátim
there
remaineth
to
me
no
one
but
thee
excepting
god
and
i
as
long
as
i
live
would
not
cease
to
hold
thy
soul
in
my
embrace
and
if
i
do
not
take
care
of
thy
soul
and
put
it
in
the
midst
of
my
eye
how
can
i
live
after
thee
if
i
knew
thy
soul

thereupon
he
said
to
me
when
i
was

declared
that
the
destruction
of
my
soul
would
be
effected
by
the
hand
of
one
of
the
sons
of
the
human
kings
i
therefore
took
my
soul
and
put
it
into
the
crop
of
a
sparrow
and
i
imprisoned
the
sparrow
in
a
little
box
and
put
this
into
another
small
box

this
i
put
within
seven
other

the
art
of

on
the
strength
of
this
accomplishment
he
kills
the
animals
one
after
the
other
and
extracts
the
precious
egg
from
the
pigeon
s
head
when
the
wolf
is
killed
the

feels
it
and
says
despondently
i
do
not

the
man
s
son
grew
up
he
tried
to
rescue
his

and
kill
the
giant
but
fire
and
sword
were
powerless
to
harm
the
monster
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
no
life
in
his

dear
mother
at
last
enquired
the
son
don
t
you
know
where
the
giant
has
hidden
away
his
life
the
mother
did
not
know
but
promised
to
ask
so
one
day
when
the
giant
chanced
to
be
in
a
good
humour
she
asked
him
where
he
kept
his
life
he
said
to
her
out
yonder
on
a
burning
sea
is
an
island
in
the
island
is
a
barrel
in
the
barrel
is
a
sheep
in
the
sheep
is
a
hen
in
the
hen
is
an
egg
and
in
the
egg
is
my
when
the
woman
s
son
heard
this
he
hired
a
bear
a
wolf
a
hawk
and
a
and
set
off
in
a
boat
to
sail
to
the
island
in
the
burning
sea
he
sat
with
the
hawk
and
the
under
an
iron
tent
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
and
he
set
the
bear
and
the
wolf
to
row
that
is
why
to
this
day
the
bear
s
hair
is
dark
brown
and
the
wolf
has
spots
for
as
they
sat
at
the
oars
without
any
screen
they
were
naturally
scorched
by
the
tossing
tongues
of
flame
on
the
burning
sea
however
they
made
their
way
over
the
fiery
billows
to
the
island
and
there
they
found
the
barrel
in
a
trice
the
bear
had
knocked
the
bottom
out
of
it
with
his
claws
and
forth
sprang
a
sheep
but
the
wolf
soon
pulled
the
sheep
down
and
rent
it
in
pieces
from
out
the
sheep
flew
a
hen
but
the
hawk
stooped
on
it
and
tore
it
with
his
talons
in
the
hen
was
an
egg
which
dropped
into
the
sea
and
sank
but
the
dived
after
it
twice
he
dived
after
it
in
vain
and
came
up
to
the
surface
gasping
and
spluttering
but
the
third
time
he
brought
up
the
egg
and
handed
it
to
the
young
man
great
was
the
young
man
s
joy
at
once
he
kindled
a
great
bonfire
on
the
shore
threw
the
egg
into
it
and
rowed
away
back
across
the
sea
on
landing
he
went
away
straight
to
the
giant
s
abode
and
found
the
monster
burning
just
as
he
had
left
the
egg
burning
on
the
island
fool
that
i
was
lamented
the
dying
giant
to
betray
my
life
to
a
wicked
old
woman
and
with
that
he
snatched
at
an
iron
tube
through
which
in
happier
days
he
had
been
wont
to
suck
the
blood
of
his
human
victims
but
the
woman
was
too
subtle
for
him
for
she
had
taken
the
precaution
of
inserting
one
end
of
the
tube
in
the
glowing
embers
of
the
hearth
and
so
when
the
giant
sucked
hard
at
the
other
end
he
imbibed
only
fire
and
ashes
thus
he
burned
inside
as
well
as
outside
and
when
the
fire
went
out
the
giant
s
life
went
out
with
it
a
samoyed
story
tells
how
seven
warlocks
killed
a
certain
man
s
mother
and
carried
off
his
sister
whom
they
kept
to
serve
them
every
night
when
they
came
home
the
seven
warlocks
used
to
take
out
their
hearts
and
place
them
in
a
dish
which
the
woman
hung
on
the
but
the
wife
of
the
man
whom
they
had
wronged
stole
the
hearts
of
the
warlocks
while
they
slept
and
took
them
to
her
husband
by
break
of
day
he
went
with
the
hearts
to
the
warlocks
and
found
them
at
the
point
of
death
they
all
begged
for
their
hearts
but
he
threw
six
of
their
hearts
to
the
ground
and
six
of
the
warlocks
died
the
seventh
and
eldest
warlock
begged
hard
for
his
heart
and
the
man
said
you
killed
my
mother
make
her
alive
again
and
i
will
give
you
back
your
the
warlock
said
to
his
wife
go
to
the
place
where
the
dead
woman
lies
you
will
find
a
bag
there
bring
it
to
me
the
woman
s
spirit
is
in
the
so
his
wife
brought
the
bag
and
the
warlock
said
to
the
man
go
to
your
dead
mother
shake
the
bag
and
let
the
spirit
breathe
over
her
bones
so
she
will
come
to
life
the
man
did
as
he
was
bid
and
his
mother
was
restored
to
life
then
he
hurled
the
seventh
heart
to
the
ground
and
the
seventh
warlock
died
in
a
kalmuck
tale
we
read
how
a
certain
khan
challenged
a
wise
man
to
shew
his
skill
by
stealing
a
precious
stone
on
which
the
khan
s
life
depended
the
sage
contrived
to
purloin
the
talisman
while
the
khan
and
his
guards
slept
but
not
content
with
this
he
gave
a
further
proof
of
his
dexterity
by
bonneting
the
slumbering
potentate
with
a
bladder
this
was
too
much
for
the
khan
next
morning
he
informed
the
sage
that
he
could
overlook
everything
else
but
that
the
indignity
of
being
bonneted
with
a
bladder
was
more
than
he
could
stand
and
he
ordered
his
facetious
friend
to
instant
execution
pained
at
this
exhibition
of
royal
ingratitude
the
sage
dashed
to
the
ground
the
talisman
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
and
at
the
same
instant
blood
flowed
from
the
nostrils
of
the
khan
and
he
gave
up
the
ghost
in
a
tartar
poem
two
heroes
named
ak

ak
molot
pierces
his
foe
through
and
through
with
an
arrow
grapples
with
him
and
dashes
him
to
the

but
all
in
vain
bulat
could
not
die
at
last
when
the
combat
has
lasted
three
years
a
friend
of
ak
molot
sees
a
golden
casket
hanging
by
a
white
thread
from
the
sky
and
bethinks
him
that
perhaps
this
casket
contains
bulat
s
soul
so
he
shot
through
the
white
thread
with
an
arrow
and
down
fell
the
casket
he
opened
it
and
in
the
casket
sat
ten
white
birds
and
one
of
the
birds
was
bulat

soul

wept
when
he
saw
that
his
soul
was
found
in
the
casket
but
one
after
the
other
the
birds
were
killed
and
then

easily
slew
his
foe

one
of

foes
sees
them
doing
so
and
digs
up
their
souls
which
he
puts
into
a
golden

and
then
sticks
the

in
his
quiver
the
two
warriors
whose

thus
been
stolen
know
that
they
have
no

and
accordingly
make
peace
with
their
enemies
in
another

a
terrible
demon
sets
all
the

at
defiance
at

a
valiant
youth
fights
the
demon
binds
him
hand
and
foot
and
slices
him
with
his
sword
but
still
the
demon
is
not
slain
so
the
youth
asked
him
tell
me
where
is
your
soul
hidden
for
if
your
soul
had
been

the

pursuing

a
modern
chinese
story
tells
how
an
habitual
criminal
used
to
take
his
soul
out
of
his
own
body
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
righteous
punishment
of
his
crimes
this
bad
man
lived
in
khien
and
the
sentences
that
had
been
passed
on
him
formed
a
pile
as
high
as
a
hill
the
mandarins
had
flogged
him
to
death
with
sticks
and
flung
his
mangled
corpse
into
the
river
but
three
days
afterwards
the
scoundrel
got
his
soul
back
again
and
on
the
fifth
day
he
resumed
his
career
of
villainy
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
thing
occurred
again
and
again
till
at
last
it
reached
the
ears
of
the
governor
of
the
province
who
flew
into
a
violent
passion
and
proposed
to
the
to
have
the
rascal
beheaded
and
beheaded
he
was
but
in
three
days
the
wretch
was
alive
again
with
no
trace
of
decapitation
about
him
except
a
slender
red
thread
round
his
neck
and
now
like
a
giant
refreshed
he
began
a
fresh
series
of
enormities
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
beat
his
own
mother
this
was
more
than
she
could
bear
and
she
brought
the
matter
before
the
magistrate
she
produced
in
court
a
vase
and
said
in
this
vase
my
refractory
son
has
hidden
his
soul
whenever
he
was
conscious
of
having
committed
a
serious
crime
or
a
misdeed
of
the
most
heinous
kind
he
remained
at
home
took
his
soul
out
of
his
body
purified
it
and
put
it
in
the
vase
then
the
authorities
only
punished
or
executed
his
body
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
his
soul
with
his
soul
refined
by
a
long
process
he
then
cured
his
freshly
mutilated
body
which
thus
became
able
in
three
days
to
recommence
in
the
old
way
now
however
his
crimes
have
reached
a
climax
for
he
has
beaten
me
an
old
woman
and
i
can
not
bear
it
i
pray
you
smash
this
vase
and
scatter
his
soul
by
fanning
it
away
with
a
windwheel
and
if
then
you
castigate
his
body
anew
it
is
probable
that
bad
son
of
mine
will
really
the
mandarin
took
the
hint
he
had
the
rogue
cudgelled
to
death
and
when
they
examined
the
corpse
they
found
that
decay
had
set
in
within
ten
days
the
khasis
of
assam
tell
of
a
certain
kyllong
king
of
madur
who
pursued
his
conquests
on
a
remarkable
principle
he
needed
few
or
no
soldiers
because
he
himself
was
a
very
strong
man
and
nobody
could
kill
him
permanently
they
could
it
is
true
put
him
to
death
but
then
he
came
to
life
again
immediately
the
king
of
synteng
who
was
much
afraid
of
him
once
chopped
him
in
pieces
and
threw
the
severed
hands
and
feet
far
away
thinking
thus
to
get
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
the
very
next
morning
kyllong
came
to
life
again
and
stalked
about
as
brisk
as
ever
so
the
king
of
synteng
was
very
anxious
to
learn
how
his
rival
contrived
thus
to
rise
from
the
dead
and
he
hit
on
a
plan
for
worming
out
the
secret
he
chose
the
fairest
girl
of
the
whole
country
clad
her
in
royal
robes
put
jewels
of
gold
and
silver
upon
her
and
said
all
these
will
i
give
thee
and
more
besides
if
thou
canst
obtain
for
me
king
kyllong
s
secret
and
canst
inform
me
how
he
brings
himself
to
life
again
after
being
so
he
sent
the
girl
to
the
in
king
kyllong
s
country
and
the
king
saw
and
loved
her
and
took
her
to
wife
so
she
caressed
him
and
coaxed
him
to
tell
her
his
secret
and
in
a
fatal
hour
he
was
beguiled
into
revealing
it
he
said
my
life
depends
upon
these
things
i
must
bathe
every
day
and
must
wash
my
entrails
after
that
i
take
my
food
and
there
is
no
one
on
earth
who
can
kill
me
unless
he
obtains
possession
of
my
entrails
thus
my
life
hangs
only
on
my
his
treacherous
wife
at
once
sent
word
to
the
king
of
synteng
who
caused
men
to
lie
in
wait
while
kyllong
was
bathing
as
usual
kyllong
had
laid
his
entrails
on
one
side
of
the
while
he
disported
himself
in
the
water
intending
afterwards
to
wash
them
and
replace
them
in
his
body
but
before
he
could
do
so
one
of
the
had
seized
the
entrails
and
killed
him
the
entrails
he
cut
in
pieces
and
gave
to
the
dogs
to
eat
that
was
the
end
of
king
kyllong
he
was
never
able
to
come
to
life
again
his
country
was
conquered
and
the
members
of
the
royal
family
were
scattered
far
and
wide
seven
generations
have
passed
since
then
a
malay
poem
relates
how
once
upon
a
time
in
the
city
of
indrapoora
there
was
a
certain
merchant
who
was
rich
and
prosperous
but
he
had
no
children
one
day
as
he
walked
with
his
wife
by
the
river
they
found
a
baby
girl
fair
as
an
angel
so
they
adopted
the
child
and
called
her
bidasari
the
merchant
caused
a
golden
fish
to
be
made
and
into
this
fish
he
transferred
the
soul
of
his
adopted
daughter
then
he
put
the
golden
fish
in
a
golden
box
full
of
water
and
hid
it
in
a
pond
in
the
midst
of
his
garden
in
time
the
girl
grew
to
be
a
lovely
woman
now
the
king
of
indrapoora
had
a
fair
young
queen
who
lived
in
fear
that
the
king
might
take
to
himself
a
second
wife
so
hearing
of
the
charms
of
bidasari
the
queen
resolved
to
put
her
out
of
the
way
she
lured
the
girl
to
the
palace
and
tortured
her
cruelly
but
bidasari
could
not
die
because
her
soul
was
not
in
her
at
last
she
could
stand
the
torture
no
longer
and
said
to
the
queen
if
you
wish
me
to
die
you
must
bring
the
box
which
is
in
the
pond
in
my
father
s
so
the
box
was
brought
and
opened
and
there
was
the
golden
fish
in
the
water
the
girl
said
my
soul
is
in
that
fish
in
the
morning
you
must
take
the
fish
out
of
the
water
and
in
the
evening
you
must
put
it
back
into
the
water
do
not
let
the
fish
lie
about
but
bind
it
round
your
neck
if
you
do
this
i
shall
soon
so
the
queen
took
the
fish
out
of
the
box
and
fastened
it
round
her
neck
and
no
sooner
had
she
done
so
than
bidasari
fell
into
a
swoon
but
in
the
evening
when
the
fish
was
put
back
into
the
water
bidasari
came
to
herself
again
seeing
that
she
thus
had
the
girl
in
her
power
the
queen
sent
her
home
to
her
adopted
parents
to
save
her
from
further
persecution
her
parents
resolved
to
remove
their
daughter
from
the
city
so
in
a
lonely
and
desolate
spot
they
built
a
house
and
brought
bidasari
thither
there
she
dwelt
alone
undergoing
vicissitudes
that
corresponded
with
the
vicissitudes
of
the
golden
fish
in
which
was
her
soul
all
day
long
while
the
fish
was
out
of
the
water
she
remained
unconscious
but
in
the
evening
when
the
fish
was
put
into
the
water
she
revived
one
day
the
king
was
out
hunting
and
coming
to
the
house
where
bidasari
lay
unconscious
was
smitten
with
her
beauty
he
tried
to
waken
her
but
in
vain
next
day
towards
evening
he
repeated
his
visit
but
still
found
her
unconscious
however
when
darkness
fell
she
came
to
herself
and
told
the
king
the
secret
of
her
life
so
the
king
returned
to
the
palace
took
the
fish
from
the
queen
and
put
it
in
water
immediately
bidasari
revived
and
the
king
took
her
to
wife
another
story
of
an
external
soul
comes
from
nias
an
island
to
the
west
of
sumatra
once
on
a
time
a
chief
was
captured
by
his
enemies
who
tried
to
put
him
to
death
but
failed
water
would
not
drown
him
nor
fire
burn
him
nor
steel
pierce
him
at
last
his
wife
revealed
the
secret
on
his
head
he
had
a
hair
as
hard
as
a
copper
wire
and
with
this
wire
his
life
was
bound
up
so
the
hair
was
plucked
out
and
with
it
his
spirit
fled
a
hausa
story
from
northern
nigeria
closely
resembles
some
of
the
european
tales
which
we
have
noticed
for
it
contains
not
only
the
incident
of
the
external
soul
but
also
the
incident
of
the
helpful
animals
by
whose
assistance
the
hero
is
able
to
slay
the
soulless
king
and
obtain
possession
of
the
kingdom
the
story
runs
thus
a
certain
man
and
his
wife
had
four
daughters
born
to
them
in
succession
but
every
one
of
the
baby
girls
mysteriously
disappeared
on
the
day
when
she
was
to
be
weaned
so
the
parents
fell
under
the
suspicion
of
having
devoured
them
last
of
all
there
was
born
to
them
a
son
who
to
avoid
accidents
was
left
to
wean
himself
one
day
as
he
grew
up
the
son
received
a
magic
lotion
from
an
old
woman
who
told
him
to
rub
his
eyes
with
it
he
did
so
and
immediately
he
saw
a
large
house
and
entering
it
he
found
his
eldest
sister
married
to
a
bull
she
bade
him
welcome
and
so
did
her
husband
the
bull
and
when
he
went
away
the
bull
very
kindly
presented
him
with
a
lock
of
his
hair
as
a
keepsake
in
like
manner
the
lad
discovered
his
other
three
sisters
who
were
living
in
wedlock
with
a
ram
a
dog
and
a
hawk
respectively
all
of
them
welcomed
him
and
from
the
ram
the
dog
and
the
hawk
he
received
tokens
of
regard
in
the
shape
of
hair
or
feathers
then
he
returned
home
and
told
his
parents
of
his
adventure
and
how
he
had
found
his
sisters
alive
and
married
next
day
he
went
to
a
far
city
where
he
made
love
to
the
queen
and
persuaded
her
to
plot
with
him
against
the
life
of
the
king
her
husband
so
she
coaxed
the
king
to
shew
his
affection
for
her
by
taking
his
own
life
and
joining
it
to
the
unsuspecting
husband
as
usual
fell
into
the
trap
set
for
him
by
his
treacherous
wife
he
confided
to
her
the
secret
of
his
life
my
life
said
he
is
behind
the
city
behind
the
city
in
a
thicket
in
this
thicket
there
is
a
lake
in
the
lake
is
a
rock
in
the
rock
is
a
gazelle
in
the
gazelle
is
a
dove
and
in
the
dove
is
a
small
the
queen
divulged
the
secret
to
her
lover
who
kindled
a
fire
behind
the
city
and
threw
into
it
the
hair
and
feathers
which
he
had
received
from
the
friendly
animals
his
immediately
the
animals
themselves
appeared
and
readily
gave
their
help
in
the
enterprise
the
bull
drank
up
the
lake
the
ram
broke
up
the
rock
the
dog
caught
the
gazelle
the
hawk
captured
the
dove
so
the
youth
extracted
the
precious
box
from
the
dove
and
repaired
to
the
palace
where
he
found
the
king
already
dead
his
majesty
had
been
ailing
from
the
moment
when
the
young
man
left
the
city
and
he
grew
steadily
worse
with
every
fresh
success
of
the
adventurer
who
was
to
supplant
him
so
the
hero
became
king
and
married
the
false
queen
and
his
sisters
husbands
were
changed
from
animals
into
men
and
received
subordinate
posts
in
the
government
the
hero
s
parents
too
came
to
live
in
the
city
over
which
he
reigned
a
west
african
story
from
southern
nigeria
relates
how
a
king
kept
his
soul
in
a
little
brown
bird
which
perched
on
a
tall
tree
beside
the
gate
of
the
palace
the
king
s
life
was
so
bound
up
with
that
of
the
bird
that
whoever
should
kill
the
bird
would
simultaneously
kill
the
king
and
succeed
to
the
kingdom
the
secret
was
betrayed
by
the
queen
to
her
lover
who
shot
the
bird
with
an
arrow
and
thereby
slew
the
king
and
ascended
the
vacant
throne
a
tale
told
by
the
of
south
africa
sets
forth
how
the
lives
of
a
whole
family
were
contained
in
one
cat
when
a
girl
of
the
family
named
titishan
married
a
husband
she
begged
her
parents
to
let
her
take
the
precious
cat
with
her
to
her
new
home
but
they
refused
saying
you
know
that
our
life
is
attached
to
it
and
they
offered
to
give
her
an
antelope
or
even
an
elephant
instead
of
it
but
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
the
cat
so
at
last
she
carried
it
off
with
her
and
shut
it
up
in
a
place
where
nobody
saw
it
even
her
husband
knew
nothing
about
it
one
day
when
she
went
to
work
in
the
fields
the
cat
escaped
from
its
place
of
concealment
entered
the
hut
put
on
the
warlike
trappings
of
the
husband
and
danced
and
sang
some
children
attracted
by
the
noise
discovered
the
cat
at
its
antics
and
when
they
expressed
their
astonishment
the
animal
only
capered
the
more
and
insulted
them
besides
so
they
went
to
the
owner
and
said
there
is
somebody
dancing
in
your
house
and
he
insulted
hold
your
tongues
said
he
i
ll
soon
put
a
stop
to
your
so
he
went
and
hid
behind
the
door
and
peeped
in
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
cat
prancing
about
and
singing
he
fired
at
it
and
the
animal
dropped
down
dead
at
the
same
moment
his
wife
fell
to
the
ground
in
the
field
where
she
was
at
work
said
she
i
have
been
killed
at
but
she
had
strength
enough
left
to
ask
her
husband
to
go
with
her
to
her
parents
village
taking
with
him
the
dead
cat
wrapt
up
in
a
mat
all
her
relatives
assembled
and
bitterly
they
reproached
her
for
having
insisted
on
taking
the
animal
with
her
to
her
husband
s
village
as
soon
as
the
mat
was
unrolled
and
they
saw
the
dead
cat
they
all
fell
down
lifeless
one
after
the
other
so
the
clan
of
the
cat
was
destroyed
and
the
bereaved
husband
closed
the
gate
of
the
village
with
a
branch
and
returned
home
and
told
his
friends
how
in
killing
the
cat
he
had
killed
the
whole
clan
because
their
lives
depended
on
the
life
of
the
cat
in
another
ronga
story
the
lives
of
a
whole
clan
are
attached
to
a
buffalo
which
a
girl
of
the
clan
in
like
manner
insists
on
taking
with
her
ideas
of
the
same
sort
meet
us
in
stories
told
by
the
north
american
indians
thus
in
one
indian
tale
the
hero
pounds
his
enemy
to
pieces
but
can
not
kill
him
because
his
heart
is
not
in
his
body
at
last
the
champion
learns
that
his
foe
s
heart
is
in
the
sky
at
the
western
side
of
the
noonday
sun
so
he
reaches
up
seizes
the
heart
and
crushes
it
and
straightway
his
enemy
expires
in
another
indian
myth
there
figures
a
personage
winter
whose
song
brings
frost
and
snow
but
his
heart
is
hidden
away
at
a
distance
however
his
foe
finds
the
heart
and
burns
it
and
so
the
perishes
a
pawnee
story
relates
how
a
wounded
warrior
was
carried
off
by
bears
who
healed
him
of
his
hurts
when
the
indian
was
about
to
return
to
his
village
the
old
said
to
him

at
parting

the
navajoes
tell
of
a

mythical
being
called
the
maiden
that
becomes
a
bear
who
learned
the
art
of
turning
herself
into
a
bear
from
the
prairie
wolf
she
was
a
great
warrior
and
quite
invulnerable
for
when
she
went
to
war
she
took
out
her
vital
organs
and
hid
them
so
that
no
one
could
kill
her
and
when
the
battle
was
over
she
put
the
organs
back
in
their
places
again
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
tell
of
an
ogress
who
could
not
be
killed
because
her
life
was
in
a
hemlock
branch
a
brave
boy
met
her
in
the
woods
smashed
her
head
with
a
stone
scattered
her
brains
broke
her
bones
and
threw
them
into
the
water
then
thinking
he
had
disposed
of
the
ogress
he
went
into
her
house
there
he
saw
a
woman
rooted
to
the
floor
who
warned
him
saying
now
do
not
stay
long
i
know
that
you
have
tried
to
kill
the
ogress
it
is
the
fourth
time
that
somebody
has
tried
to
kill
her
she
never
dies
she
has
nearly
come
to
life
there
in
that
covered
hemlock
branch
is
her
life
go
there
and
as
soon
as
you
see
her
enter
shoot
her
life
then
she
will
be
hardly
had
she
finished
speaking
when
sure
enough
in
came
the
ogress
singing
as
she
walked
have
the
magical
treasure
have
the
supernatural
power
can
return

chapter
xi
the
external
soul
in
the
external
soul
in
inanimate
things
thus
the
idea
that
the
soul
may
be
deposited
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
in
some
place
of
security
outside
the
body
or
at
all
events
in
the
hair
is
found
in
the
popular
tales
of
many
races
it
remains
to
shew
that
the
idea
is
not
a
mere
figment
devised
to
adorn
a
tale
but
is
a
real
article
of
primitive
faith
which
has
given
rise
to
a
corresponding
set
of
customs
we
have
seen
that
in
the
tales
the
hero
as
a
preparation
for
battle
sometimes
removes
his
soul
from
his
body
in
order
that
his
body
may
be
invulnerable
and
immortal
in
the
combat
with
a
like
intention
the
savage
removes
his
soul
from
his
body
on
various
occasions
of
real
or
imaginary
peril
thus
among
the
people
of
minahassa
in
celebes
when
a
family
moves
into
a
new
house
a
priest
collects
the
souls
of
the
whole
family
in
a
bag
and
afterwards
restores
them
to
their
owners
because
the
moment
of
entering
a
new
house
is
supposed
to
be
fraught
with
supernatural
danger
in
southern
celebes
when
a
woman
is
brought
to
bed
the
messenger
who
fetches
the
doctor
or
the
midwife
always
carries
with
him
something
made
of
iron
such
as
a
which
he
delivers
to
the
doctor
the
doctor
must
keep
the
thing
in
his
house
till
the
confinement
is
over
when
he
gives
it
back
receiving
a
fixed
sum
of
money
for
doing
so
the
or
whatever
it
is
represents
the
woman
s
soul
which
at
this
critical
time
is
believed
to
be
safer
out
of
her
body
than
in
it
hence
the
doctor
must
take
great
care
of
the
object
for
were
it
lost
the
woman
s
soul
would
assuredly
they
think
be
lost
with
it
but
in
celebes
the
convenience
of
occasionally
depositing
the
soul
in
some
external
object
is
apparently
not
limited
to
human
beings
the
alfoors
or
toradjas
who
inhabit
the
central
district
of
that
island
and
among
whose
industries
the
working
of
iron
occupies
a
foremost
place
attribute
to
the
metal
a
soul
which
would
be
apt
to
desert
its
body
under
the
blows
of
the
hammer
if
some
means
were
not
found
to
detain
it
accordingly
in
every
smithy
of
that
is
the
name
of
the
country
of
these
may
see
hanging
up
a
bundle
of
wooden
instruments
such
as
swords
and
so
forth
this
bundle
goes
by
the
name
of
which
is
the
general
word
for
gods
and
in
it
the
soul
of
the
iron
that
is
being
wrought
in
the
smithy
is
according
to
one
account
supposed
to
reside
if
we
did
not
hang
the
over
the
anvil
they
say
the
iron
would
flow
away
and
be
unworkable
on
account
of
the
absence
of
the
soul
however
according
to
another
interpretation
these
wooden
models
are
substitutes
offered
to
the
gods
in
room
of
the
iron
whose
soul
the
covetous
deities
might
otherwise
abstract
for
their
own
use
thus
making
the
metal
unmalleable
among
the
dyaks
of
pinoeh
a
district
of
borneo
when
a
child
is
born
a
is
sent
for
who
conjures
the
soul
of
the
infant
into
half
a
which
he
thereupon
covers
with
a
cloth
and
places
on
a
square
platter
or
charger
suspended
by
cords
from
the
roof
this
ceremony
he
repeats
at
every
new
moon
for
a
year
the
intention
of
the
ceremony
is
not
explained
by
the
writer
who
describes
it
but
we
may
conjecture
that
it
is
to
place
the
soul
of
the
child
in
a
safer
place
than
its
own
frail
little
body
this
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
reason
assigned
for
a
similar
custom
observed
elsewhere
in
the
indian
archipelago
in
the
kei
islands
when
there
is
a
child
in
a
house
an
empty
split
and
spliced
together
again
may
sometimes
be
seen
hanging
beside
a
rough
wooden
image
of
an
ancestor
the
soul
of
the
infant
is
believed
to
be
temporarily
deposited
in
the
in
order
that
it
may
be
safe
from
the
attacks
of
evil
spirits
but
when
the
child
grows
bigger
and
stronger
the
soul
will
take
up
its
permanent
abode
in
its
own
body
similarly
among
the
esquimaux
of
alaska
when
a
child
is
sick
the
will
sometimes
extract
its
soul
from
its
body
and
place
it
for
in
an
amulet
which
for
further
security
he
deposits
in
his
own
it
seems
probable
that
many
amulets
have
been
similarly
regarded
as
that
is
as
safes
in
which
the
souls
of
the
owners
are
kept
for
greater
security
an
old
mang
anje
woman
in
the
west
shire
district
of
british
central
africa
used
to
wear
round
her
neck
an
ivory
ornament
hollow
and
about
three
inches
long
which
she
called
her
life
or
soul
naturally
she
would
not
part
with
it
a
planter
tried
to
buy
it
of
her
but
in
vain
when
james
macdonald
was
one
day
sitting
in
the
house
of
a
hlubi
chief
awaiting
the
appearance
of
that
great
man
who
was
busy
decorating
his
person
a
native
pointed
to
a
pair
of
magnificent
and
said
ntame

his
soul
in

the
horns
were
those
of
an
animal
which
had
been
sacrificed
and
they
were
held
sacred
a
magician
had
fastened
them
to
the
roof
to
protect
the
house
and
its
inmates
from
the
the
idea
adds
macdonald
is
in
no
way
foreign
to
south
african
thought
a
man
s
soul
there
may
dwell
in
the
roof
of
his
house
in
a
tree
by
a
spring
of
water
or
on
some
mountain
among
the
natives
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
there
is
a
secret
society
which
goes
by
the
name
of
ingniet
or
ingiet
on
his
entrance
into
it
every
man
receives
a
stone
in
the
shape
either
of
a
human
being
or
of
an
animal
and
henceforth
his
soul
is
believed
to
be
knit
up
in
a
manner
with
the
stone
if
it
breaks
it
is
an
evil
omen
for
him
they
say
that
the
thunder
has
struck
the
stone
and
that
he
who
owns
it
will
soon
die
if
nevertheless
the
man
survives
the
breaking
of
his
they
say
that
it
was
not
a
proper
and
he
gets
a
new
one
instead
the
emperor
romanus
lecapenus
was
once
informed
by
an
astronomer
that
the
life
of
simeon
prince
of
bulgaria
was
bound
up
with
a
certain
column
in
constantinople
so
that
if
the
capital
of
the
column
were
removed
simeon
would
immediately
die
the
emperor
took
the
hint
and
removed
the
capital
and
at
the
same
hour
as
the
emperor
learned
by
enquiry
simeon
died
of
heart
disease
in
bulgaria
the
deified
kings
of
ancient
egypt
appear
to
have
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
depositing
their
spiritual
doubles
or
souls
during
their
lifetime
in
a
number
of
portrait
statues
properly
fourteen
for
each
king
which
stood
in
the
chamber
of
adoration
of

temple

were
revered

the

of
the

is
supposed
to
be
in

way
connected
with
it

lost

destroyed

the

will
not
be

among
the
shawnee
indians
of
north
america
it
once
happened
that
an
eminent
man
was
favoured
with
a
special
revelation
by
the
great
spirit
wisely
refusing
to
hide
the
sacred
light
of
revelation
under
a
bushel
he
generously
communicated
a
few
sparks
of
the
illumination
to
john
tanner
a
white
man
who
lived
for
many
years
as
an
indian
among
the
indians
henceforth
said
the
inspired
sage
the
fire
must
never
be
suffered
to
go
out
in
your
lodge
summer
and
winter
day
and
night
in
the
storm
or
when
it
is
calm
you
must
remember
that
the
life
in
your
body
and
the
fire
in
your
lodge
are
the
same
and
of
the
same
date
if
you
suffer
your
fire
to
be
extinguished
at
that
moment
your
life
will
be
at
its
again
we
have
seen
that
in
a
man
s
soul
or
strength
is
sometimes
represented
as
bound
up
with
his
hair
and
that
when
his
hair
is
cut
off
he
dies
or
grows
weak
so
the
natives
of
amboyna
used
to
think
that
their
strength
was
in
their
hair
and
would
desert
them
if
it
were
shorn
a
criminal
under
torture
in
a
dutch
court
of
that
island
persisted
in
denying
his
guilt
till
his
hair
was
cut
off
when
he
immediately
confessed
one
man
who
was
tried
for
murder
endured
without
flinching
the
utmost
ingenuity
of
his
torturers
till
he
saw
the
surgeon
standing
with
a
pair
of
shears
on
asking
what
this
was
for
and
being
told
that
it
was
to
cut
his
hair
he
begged
they
would
not
do
it
and
made
a
clean
breast
in
subsequent
cases
when
torture
failed
to
wring
a
confession
from
a
prisoner
the
dutch
authorities
made
a
practice
of
cutting
off
his
hair
in
ceram
it
is
still
believed
that
if
young
people
have
their
hair
cut
they
will
be
weakened
and
enervated
thereby
here
in
europe
it
used
to
be
thought
that
the
maleficent
powers
of
witches
and
wizards
resided
in
their
hair
and
that
nothing
could
make
any
impression
on
these
miscreants
so
long
as
they
kept
their
hair
on
hence
in
france
it
was
customary
to
shave
the
whole
bodies
of
persons
charged
with
sorcery
before
handing
them
over
to
the
torturer
millaeus
witnessed
the
torture
of
some
persons
at
toulouse
from
whom
no
confession
could
be
wrung
until
they
were
stripped
and
completely
shaven
when
they
readily
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
charge
a
woman
also
who
apparently
led
a
pious
life
was
put
to
the
torture
on
suspicion
of
witchcraft
and
bore
her
agonies
with
incredible
constancy
until
complete
depilation
drove
her
to
admit
her
guilt
the
noted
inquisitor
sprenger
contented
himself
with
shaving
the
head
of
the
suspected
witch
or
wizard
but
his
more
colleague
cumanus
shaved
the
whole
bodies
of
women
before
committing
them
all
to
the
flames
he
had
high
authority
for
this
rigorous
scrutiny
since
satan
himself
in
a
sermon
preached
from
the
pulpit
of
north
berwick
church
comforted
his
many
servants
by
assuring
them
that
no
harm
could
befall
them
sa
lang
as
their
hair
wes
on
and
sould
newir
latt
ane

fall
fra

similarly
in
bastar
a
province
of
india
if
a
man
is
adjudged
guilty
of
witchcraft
he
is
beaten
by
the
crowd
his
hair
is
shaved
the
hair
being
supposed
to
constitute
his
power
of
mischief
his
front
teeth
are
knocked
out
in
order
it
is
said
to
prevent
him
from
muttering
incantations
women
suspected
of
sorcery
have
to
undergo
the
same
ordeal
if
found
guilty
the
same
punishment
is
awarded
and
after
being
shaved
their
hair
is
attached
to
a
tree
in
some
public
so
among
the
bhils
of
india
when
a
woman
was
convicted
of
witchcraft
and
had
been
subjected
to
various
forms
of
persuasion
such
as
hanging
head
downwards
from
a
tree
and
having
pepper
put
into
her
eyes
a
lock
of
hair
was
cut
from
her
head
and
buried
in
the
ground
that
the
last
link
between
her
and
her
former
powers
of
mischief
might
be
in
like
manner
among
the
aztecs
of
mexico
when
wizards
and
witches
had
done
their
evil
deeds
and
the
time
came
to
put
an
end
to
their
detestable
life
some
one
laid
hold
of
them
and
cropped
the
hair
on
the
crown
of
their
heads
which
took
from
them
all
their
power
of
sorcery
and
enchantment
and
then
it
was
that
by
death
they
put
an
end
to
their
odious
the
external
soul
in
plants
further
it
has
been
shewn
that
in
the
life
of
a
person
is
sometimes
so
bound
up
with
the
life
of
a
plant
that
the
withering
of
the
plant
will
immediately
follow
or
be
followed
by
the
death
of
the
person
similarly
among
the
natives
of
the
pennefather
river
in
queensland
when
a
visiter
has
made
himself
very
agreeable
and
taken
his
departure
an
effigy
of
him
about
three
or
four
feet
long
is
cut
on
some
soft
tree
such
as
the
so
as
to
face
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
popular
stranger
afterwards
from
observing
the
state
of
the
tree
the
natives
infer
the
corresponding
state
of
their
absent
friend
whose
illness
or
death
are
apparently
supposed
to
be
portended
by
the
fall
of
the
leaves
or
of
the
tree
in
uganda
when
a
new
royal
enclosure
with
its
numerous
houses
was
built
for
a
new
king
barkcloth
trees
used
to
be
planted
at
the
main
entrance
by
priests
of
each
principal
deity
and
offerings
were
laid
under
each
tree
for
its
particular
god
thenceforth
the
trees
were
carefully
guarded
and
tended
because
it
was
believed
that
as
they
grew
and
flourished
so
the
king
s
life
and
power
would
among
the
m
bengas
in
western
africa
about
the
gaboon
when
two
children
are
born
on
the
same
day
the
people
plant
two
trees
of
the
same
kind
and
dance
round
them
the
life
of
each
of
the
children
is
believed
to
be
bound
up
with
the
life
of
one
of
the
trees
and
if
the
tree
dies
or
is
thrown
down
they
are
sure
that
the
child
will
soon
die
in
sierra
leone
also
it
is
customary
at
the
birth
of
a
child
to
plant
a
shoot
of
a
and
they
think
that
the
tree
will
grow
with
the
child
and
be
its
god
if
a
tree
which
has
been
thus
planted
withers
away
the
people
consult
a
sorcerer
on
the
subject
among
the
wajagga
of
german
east
africa
when
a
child
is
born
it
is
usual
to
plant
a
cultivated
plant
of
some
sort
behind
the
house
the
plant
is
thenceforth
carefully
tended
for
they
believe
that
were
it
to
wither
away
the
child
would
die
when
the
drops

he
or

may
one
day
enjoy
the

of
the
tree
which
we
plant
though
it
is
not
expressly
affirmed
we
may
perhaps
assume
that
such
a
is
supposed
to
stand
in
a
sympathetic
relation
with
the
life
of
the
person
in
the
cameroons
also
the
life
of
a
person
is
believed
to
be
sympathetically
bound
up
with
that
of
a
tree
the
chief
of
old
town
in
calabar
kept
his
soul
in
a
sacred
grove
near
a
spring
of
water
when
some
europeans
in
frolic
or
ignorance
cut
down
part
of
the
grove
the
spirit
was
most
indignant
and
threatened
the
perpetrators
of
the
deed
according
to
the
king
with
all
manner
of
evil
among
the
fans
of
the
french
congo
when
a
chief
s
son
is
born
the
remains
of
the
are
buried
under
a
sacred
and
thenceforth
great
importance
is
attached
to
the
growth
of
the
tree
it
is
strictly
forbidden
to
touch
it
any
attempt
on
the
tree
would
be
considered
as
an
attack
on
the
human
being
among
the
boloki
of
the
upper
congo
a
family
has
a
plant
with
red
leaves
called
for
its
totem
when
a
woman
of
the
family
is
with
child
for
the
first
time
one
of
the
totemic
plants
is
planted
near
the
hearth
outside
the
house
and
is
never
destroyed
otherwise
it
is
believed
that
the
child
would
be
born
thin
and
weak
and
would
remain
puny
and
sickly
the
healthy
life
of
the
children
and
family
is
bound
up
with
the
healthiness
and
life
of
the
totem
tree
as
respected
and
preserved
by
the
among
the
baganda
of
central
africa
a
child
s
afterbirth
was
called
the
second
child
and
was
believed
to
be
animated
by
a
spirit
which
at
once
became
a
ghost
the
afterbirth
was
usually
buried
at
the
root
of
a
banana
tree
and
afterwards
the
tree
was
carefully
guarded
by
old
women
who
prevented
any
one
from
going
near
it
they
tied
ropes
of
fibre
from
tree
to
tree
to
isolate
it
and
all
the
child
s
excretions
were
thrown
into
this
enclosure
when
the
fruit
ripened
it
was
cut
by
the
old
woman
in
charge
the
reason
for
guarding
the
tree
thus
carefully
was
a
belief
that
if
any
stranger
were
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
or
to
drink
beer
brewed
from
it
he
would
carry
off
with
him
the
ghost
of
the
child
s
afterbirth
which
had
been
buried
at
the
root
of
the
and
the
living
child
would
then
die
in
order
to
follow
its
twin
ghost
whereas
a
grandparent
of
the
child
by
eating
the
fruit
or
drinking
the
beer
averted
this
catastrophe
and
ensured
the
health
of
the
child
among
the
wakondyo
at
the
corner
of
lake
albert
nyanza
it
is
customary
to
bury
the
afterbirth
at
the
foot
of
a
young
and
the
fruit
of
this
particular
tree
may
be
eaten
by
no
one
but
the
woman
who
assisted
at
the
birth
the
reason
for
the
custom
is
not
mentioned
but
probably
as
among
the
baganda
the
life
of
the
child
is
supposed
to
be
bound
up
with
the
life
of
the
tree
since
the
afterbirth
regarded
as
a
spiritual
double
of
the
infant
has
been
buried
at
the
root
of
the
tree
some
of
the
papuans
unite
the
life
of
a
child
sympathetically
with
that
of
a
tree
by
driving
a
pebble
into
the
bark
of
the
tree
this
is
supposed
to
give
them
complete
mastery
over
the
child
s
life
if
the
tree
is
cut
down
the
child
will
die
after
a
birth
the
maoris
used
to
bury
the
in
a
sacred
place
and
plant
a
young
sapling
over
it
as
the
tree
grew
it
was
a
or
sign
of
life
for
the
child
if
it
flourished
the
child
would
prosper
if
it
withered
and
died
the
parents
augured
the
worst
for
their
child
in
the
chatham
islands
when
the
child
of
a
leading
man
received
its
name
it
was
customary
to
plant
a
tree
the
growth
of
which
was
to
be
as
the
growth
of
the
child
and
during
the
planting
priests
chanted
a
spell
in
some
parts
of
fiji
the
of
a
male
child
is
planted
together
with
a
or
the
slip
of
a
and
the
child
s
life
is
supposed
to
be
intimately
connected
with
that
of
the
tree
with
certain
families
of
the
patani
states
it
is
customary
to
bury
the
afterbirth
under
a
and
the
condition
of
the
tree
is
afterwards
regarded
as
ominous
of
the
child
s
fate
for
good
or
evil
in
southern
celebes
when
a
child
is
born
a
is
planted
and
watered
with
the
water
in
which
the
afterbirth
and
have
been
washed
as
it
grows
up
the
tree
is
called
the
contemporary
of
the
child
so
in
bali
a
is
planted
at
the
birth
of
a
child
it
is
believed
to
grow
up
equally
with
the
child
and
is
called
its
on
certain
occasions
the
dyaks
of
borneo
plant
a
which
is
believed
to
be
a
complete
index
of
their
fate
if
it
flourishes
they
reckon
on
good
fortune
but
if
it
withers
or
dies
they
expect
misfortune
amongst
the
dyaks
of
landak
and
tajan
districts
of
dutch
borneo
it
is
customary
to
plant
a
for
a
child
and
henceforth
in
the
popular
belief
the
fate
of
the
child
is
bound
up
with
that
of
the
tree
if
the
tree
shoots
up
rapidly
it
will
go
well
with
the
child
but
if
the
tree
is
dwarfed
or
shrivelled
nothing
but
misfortune
can
be
expected
for
its
human
counterpart
according
to
another
account
at
the
naming
of
children
and
certain
other
festivals
the
dyaks
are
wont
to
set
a
roots
and
all
before
a
priestess
and
when
the
festival
is
over
the
plant
is
replaced
in
the
ground
such
a
plant
becomes
thenceforth
a
sort
of
prophetic
index
for
the
person
in
whose
honour
the
festival
was
held
if
the
plant
thrives
the
man
will
be
fortunate
if
it
fades
or
perishes
some
evil
will
befall
him
the
dyaks
also
believe
that
at
the
birth
of
every
person
on
earth
a
flower
grows
up
in
the
spirit
world
and
leads
a
life
parallel
to
his
if
the
flower
flourishes
the
man
enjoys
good
health
but
if
it
droops
so
does
he
hence
when
he
has
dreamed
bad
dreams
or
has
felt
unwell
for
several
days
he
infers
that
his
flower
in
the
other
world
is
neglected
or
sickly
and
accordingly
he
employs
a
to
tend
the
precious
plant
weed
the
soil
and
sweep
it
up
in
order
that
the
earthly
and
unearthly
life
may
prosper
once
more
it
is
said
that
there
are
still
families
in
russia
germany
england
france
and
italy
who
are
accustomed
to
plant
a
tree
at
the
birth
of
a
child
the
tree
it
is
hoped
will
grow
with
the
child
and
it
is
tended
with
special
care
the
custom
is
still
pretty
general
in
the
canton
of
aargau
in
switzerland
an
is
planted
for
a
boy
and
a
for
a
girl
and
the
people
think
that
the
child
will
flourish
or
dwindle
with
the
tree
in
mecklenburg
the
afterbirth
is
thrown
out
at
the
foot
of
a
young
tree
and
the
child
is
then
believed
to
grow
with
the
tree
in
bosnia
when
the
children
of
a
family
have
died
one
after
the
other
the
hair
of
the
next
child
is
cut
with
some
ceremony
by
a
stranger
and
the
mother
carries
the
shorn
tresses
into
the
garden
where
she
ties
them
to
a
fine
young
tree
in
order
that
her
child
may
grow
and
flourish
like
the
tree
at
muskau
in
lausitz
it
used
to
be
customary
for
bride
and
bridegroom
on
the
morning
of
their
to
plant
a
pair
of
young
oaks
side
by
side
and
as
each
of
the
trees
flourished
or
withered
so
the
good
luck
of
the
person
who
planted
it
was
believed
to
wax
or
wane
on
a
promontory
in
lake
keitele
in
finland
there
used
to
stand
an
old
which
according
to
tradition
had
been
planted
by
the
first
colonists
to
serve
as
a
symbol
or
token
of
their
fortune
of
the
harvest
used
to
be
offered
to
the
tree
before
any
one
would
taste
of
the
new
crop
and
whenever
a
branch
fell
it
was
deemed
a
sign
that
some
one
would
die
more
and
more
the
crown
of
the
tree
withered
away
and
in
the
same
proportion
the
family
whose
ancestors
had
planted
the
fir
dwindled
away
till
only
one
old
woman
was
left
at
last
the
tree
fell
and
soon
afterwards
the
old
woman
departed
this
life
when
lord
byron
first
visited
his
ancestral
estate
of
newstead
he
planted
it
seems
a
young
oak
in
some
part
of
the
grounds
and
had
an
idea
that
as
flourished
so
should
on
a
day
when
the
cloud
that
settled
on
the
later
years
of
sir
walter
scott
lifted
a
little
and
he
heard
that
had
sold
for
over
eight
thousand
pounds
he
wrote
in
his
journal
i
have
a
curious
fancy
i
will
go
set
two
or
three
acorns
and
judge
by
their
success
in
growing
whether
i
shall
succeed
in
clearing
my
way
or
near
the
castle
of
dalhousie
not
far
from
edinburgh
there
grows
an
called
the
edgewell
tree
which
is
popularly
believed
to
be
linked
to
the
fate
of
the
family
by
a
mysterious
tie
for
they
say
that
when
one
of
the
family
dies
or
is
about
to
die
a
branch
falls
from
the
edgewell
tree
thus
on
seeing
a
great
bough
drop
from
the
tree
on
a
quiet
still
day
in
july
an
old
forester
exclaimed
the
laird
s
deid
noo
and
soon
after
news
came
that
fox
maule
eleventh
earl
of
dalhousie
was
dead
at
howth
castle
in
ireland
there
is
an
old
tree
with
which
the
fortunes
of
the
lawrence
family
are
supposed
to
be
connected
the
branches
of
the
tree
are
propped
on
strong
supports
for
tradition
runs
that
when
the
tree
falls
the
direct
line
of
the
earls
of
howth
will
become
extinct
on
the
old
road
from
hanover
to
osnabrück
at
the
village
of
there
used
to
stand
an
ancient
oak
which
put
out
its
last
green
shoot
in
the
year
the
tree
was
conjecturally
supposed
to
be
contemporary
with
the
guelphs
and
in
the
year
so
fatal
for
the
house
of
hanover
on
a
calm
summer
afternoon
without
any
visible
cause
the
veteran
suddenly
fell
with
a
crash
and
lay
stretched
across
the
highroad
the
peasants
regarded
its
fall
as
an
ill
omen
for
the
reigning
family
and
when
king
george
heard
of
it
he
gave
orders
that
the
giant
trunk
should
be
set
up
again
and
it
was
done
with
much
trouble
and
at
great
expense
the
stump
being
supported
in
position
by
iron
chains
clamped
to
the
neighbouring
trees
but
the
king
s
efforts
to
prop
the
falling
fortunes
of
his
house
were
vain
a
few
months
after
the
fall
of
the
oak
hanover
formed
part
of
the
prussian
monarchy
in
the
midst
of
the
forbidden
city
at
peking
there
is
a
tiny
private
garden
where
the
emperors
of
the
now
fallen
manchu
dynasty
used
to
take
the
air
and
refresh
themselves
after
the
cares
of
state
in
accordance
with
chinese
taste
the
garden
is
a
labyrinth
of
artificial
rockeries
waterfalls
grottoes
and
kiosks
in
which
everything
is
as
unlike
nature
as
art
can
make
it
the
trees
in
particular
the
principal
ornament
of
the
garden
exhibit
the
last
refinement
of
the
gardener
s
skill
being
clipped
and
distorted
into
a
variety
of
grotesque
shapes
only
one
of
the
trees
remained
intact
and
had
been
spared
these
deformations
for
centuries
far
from
being
stunted
by
the
axe
or
the
shears
the
tree
was
carefully
tended
and
encouraged
to
shoot
up
to
its
full
height
it
was
the
of
the
dynasty
and
according
to
legend
the
prosperity
or
fall
of
the
present
dynasty
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
welfare
or
death
of
the
tree
certainly
if
we
accept
the
tradition
the
days
of
the
present
reigning
house
must
be
numbered
for
all
the
care
and
attention
lavished
on
the
tree
have
been
for
some
years
in
vain
a
glance
at
our
illustration
shews
the
tree
as
it
still
surpasses
all
its
fellows
in
height
and
size
but
it
owes
its
only
to
the
many
artificial
props
which
hold
it
up
in
reality
the
of
the
dynasty
is
dying
and
might
fall
over
night
if
one
of
its
artificial
props
were
suddenly
to
give
way
for
the
superstitious
superstitious
they
certainly
is
a
very
very
evil
some
twelve
years
have
passed
since
this
passage
was
written
and
in
the
interval
the
omen
has
been
manchu
dynasty
has
fallen
we
may
conjecture
that
the
old
tree
in
the
quaint
old
garden
has
fallen
too
so
vain
are
all
human
efforts
to
arrest
the
decay
of
royal
houses
by
underpropping
trees
on
which
nature
herself
has
passed
a
sentence
of
death
at
rome
in
the
ancient
sanctuary
of
quirinus
there
grew
two
old
one
named
the
patrician
and
the
other
the
plebeian
for
many
years
so
long
as
the
patricians
were
in
the
ascendant
their
flourished
and
spread
its
branches
abroad
while
the
myrtle
of
the
plebeians
was
shrivelled
and
shrunken
but
from
the
time
of
the
marsian
war
when
the
power
of
the
nobles
declined
their
myrtle
in
like
manner
drooped
and
withered
whereas
that
of
the
popular
party
held
up
its
head
and
grew
strong
thrice
when
vespasia
was
with
child
an
old
oak
in
the
garden
of
the
flavian
family
near
rome
suddenly
put
forth
branches
the
first
branch
was
puny
and
soon
withered
away
and
the
girl
who
was
born
accordingly
died
within
the
year
the
second
branch
was
long
and
sturdy
and
the
third
was
like
a
tree
so
on
the
third
occasion
the
happy
father
reported
to
his
mother
that
a
future
emperor
was
born
to
her
as
a
grandchild
the
old
lady
only
laughed
to
think
that
at
her
age
she
should
keep
her
wits
about
her
while
her
son
had
lost
his
yet
the
omen
of
the
oak
came
true
for
the
grandson
was
afterwards
the
emperor
vespasian
in
england
children
are
sometimes
passed
through
a
cleft
as
a
cure
for
rupture
or
rickets
and
thenceforward
a
sympathetic
connexion
is
supposed
to
exist
between
them
and
the
tree
an
which
had
been
used
for
this
purpose
grew
at
the
edge
of
shirley
heath
on
the
road
from
hockly
house
to
birmingham
thomas
chillingworth
son
of
the
owner
of
an
adjoining
farm
now
about
was
when
an
infant
of
a
year
old
passed
through
a
similar
tree
now
perfectly
sound
which
he
preserves
with
so
much
care
that
he
will
not
suffer
a
single
branch
to
be
touched
for
it
is
believed
the
life
of
the
patient
depends
on
the
life
of
the
tree
and
the
moment
that
it
is
cut
down
be
the
patient
ever
so
distant
the
rupture
returns
and
a
mortification
ensues
and
terminates
in
death
as
was
the
case
in
a
man
driving
a
waggon
on
the
very
road
in
it
is
not
uncommon
however
adds
the
writer
for
persons
to
survive
for
a
time
the
felling
of
the
the
ordinary
mode
of
effecting
the
cure
is
to
split
a
young
longitudinally
for
a
few
feet
and
pass
the
child
naked
either
three
times
or
three
times
three
through
the
fissure
at
sunrise
in
the
west
of
england
it
is
said
that
the
passage
should
be
against
the
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
has
been
performed
the
tree
is
bound
tightly
up
and
the
fissure
plastered
over
with
mud
or
clay
the
belief
is
that
just
as
the
cleft
in
the
tree
closes
up
so
the
rupture
in
the
child
s
body
will
be
healed
but
that
if
the
rift
in
the
tree
remains
open
the
rupture
in
the
child
will
remain
too
and
if
the
tree
were
to
die
the
death
of
the
child
would
surely
follow
down
to
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
remedy
was
still
in
common
use
at
fittleworth
and
many
other
places
in
sussex
the
account
of
the
sussex
practice
and
belief
is
notable
because
it
brings
out
very
clearly
the
sympathetic
relation
supposed
to
exist
between
the
ruptured
child
and
the
tree
through
which
it
has
been
passed
we
are
told
that
the
patient
must
be
passed
nine
times
every
morning
on
nine
successive
days
at
sunrise
through
a
cleft
in
a
sapling
which
has
been
so
far
given
up
by
the
owner
of
it
to
the
parents
of
the
child
as
that
there
is
an
understanding
it
shall
not
be
cut
down
during
the
life
of
the
infant
who
is
to
be
passed
through
it
the
sapling
must
be
sound
at
heart
and
the
cleft
must
be
made
with
an
axe
the
child
on
being
carried
to
the
tree
must
be
attended
by
nine
persons
each
of
whom
must
pass
it
through
the
cleft
from
west
to
east
on
the
ninth
morning
the
solemn
ceremony
is
concluded
by
binding
the
tree
lightly
with
a
cord
and
it
is
supposed
that
as
the
cleft
closes
the
health
of
the
child
will
improve
in
the
neighbourhood
of
petworth
some
cleft
may
be
seen
through
which
children
have
very
recently
been
passed
i
may
add
that
only
a
few
weeks
since
a
person
who
had
lately
purchased
an
standing
in
this
parish
intending
to
cut
it
down
was
told
by
the
father
of
a
child
who
had
some
time
before
been
passed
through
it
that
the
infirmity
would
be
sure
to
return
upon
his
son
if
it
were
felled
whereupon
the
good
man
said
he
knew
that
such
would
be
the
case
and
therefore
he
would
not
fell
it
for
the
a
similar
cure
for
various
diseases
but
especially
for
rupture
and
rickets
has
been
commonly
practised
in
other
parts
of
europe
as
germany
france
denmark
and
sweden
but
in
these
countries
the
tree
employed
for
the
purpose
is
usually
not
an
ash
but
an
oak
sometimes
a
is
allowed
or
even
prescribed
instead
with
these
exceptions
the
practice
and
the
belief
are
nearly
the
same
on
the
continent
as
in
england
a
young
oak
is
split
longitudinally
and
the
two
sides
held
forcibly
apart
while
the
sick
child
is
passed
through
the
cleft
then
the
opening
in
the
tree
is
closed
and
bound
up
and
it
is
believed
that
as
the
cleft
in
the
tree
heals
by
the
parts
growing
together
again
so
the
rupture
in
the
child
will
be
simultaneously
cured
it
is
often
laid
down
that
the
ceremony
must
be
performed
in
the
strictest
silence
sometimes
the
time
prescribed
is
before
sunrise
and
sometimes
the
child
must
be
passed
thrice
through
the
cleft
in
oldenburg
and
mecklenburg
they
say
that
the
cure
should
be
performed
on
john
s
eve
midsummer
eve
by
three
men
named
john
who
assist
each
other
in
holding
the
split
open
and
passing
the
child
through
it
some
people
however
prefer
good
friday
or
christmas
eve
as
the
season
for
the
performance
of
the
ceremony
in
denmark
copper
coins
are
laid
as
an
offering
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
through
which
sick
persons
have
been
passed
and
threads
ribbons
or
bandages
which
have
been
worn
by
the
sufferers
are
tied
to
a
branch
of
the
tree
in
the
greek
island
of
ceos
when
a
child
is
sickly
the
parents
carry
it
out
into
the
country
and
the
father
selects
a
young
oak
this
they
split
up
from
the
root
then
the
father
is
assisted
by
another
man
in
holding
the
tree
open
whilst
the
mother
passes
the
child
three
times
through
and
then
they
bind
up
the
tree
well
cover
it
all
over
with
manure
and
carefully
water
it
for
forty
days
in
the
same
fashion
they
bind
up
the
child
for
a
like
period
and
after
the
lapse
of
this
time
they
expect
that
it
will
be
quite
in
mecklenburg
as
in
england
the
sympathetic
relation
thus
established
between
the
tree
and
the
child
is
so
close
that
if
the
tree
is
cut
down
the
child
will
die
in
the
island
of
rügen
people
believe
that
when
a
person
who
has
been
thus
cured
of
rupture
dies
his
soul
passes
into
the
same
through
which
his
body
was
passed
in
his
youth
thus
it
seems
that
in
ridding
himself
of
the
disease
the
sufferer
is
supposed
to
transfer
a
certain
vital
part
of
his
person
to
the
tree
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
injure
the
tree
without
at
the
same
time
injuring
the
man
and
in
rügen
this
partial
union
is
thought
to
be
completed
by
the
transmigration
of
the
man
s
soul
at
death
into
the
tree
apparently
the
disease
is
conceived
as
something
physical
which
clings
to
the
patient
but
can
be
stripped
off
him
and
left
behind
on
the
farther
side
of
the
narrow
aperture
through
which
he
has
forced
his
way
when
the
aperture
is
closed
by
the
natural
growth
of
the
tree
the
door
is
as
it
were
shut
against
the
disease
which
is
then
unable
to
pursue
and
overtake
the
sufferer
hence
the
idea
at
the
root
of
the
custom
is
not
so
much
that
the
patient
has
transferred
his
ailment
to
the
tree
as
that
the
tree
forms
an
impervious
barrier
between
him
and
the
malady
which
had
hitherto
afflicted
him
this
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
following
parallels
in
those
parts
of
armenia
which
are
covered
with
forests
many
great
and
ancient
trees
are
revered
as
sacred
and
receive
marks
of
homage
the
people
burn
lights
before
them
fumigate
them
with
incense
sacrifice
cocks
and
wethers
to
them
and
creep
through
holes
in
their
trunks
or
push
lean
and
sickly
children
through
them
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
influence
of
evil
apparently
they
think
that
evil
spirits
can
not
creep
through
the
cleft
in
the
holy
tree
and
therefore
that
the
sick
who
have
effected
the
passage
are
safe
from
their
demoniacal
pursuers
the
same
conception
of
a
fissure
in
a
tree
as
an
obstacle
placed
in
the
path
of
pursuing
spirits
meets
us
in
a
number
of
savage
customs
thus
in
the
island
of
nias
when
a
man
is
in
training
for
the
priesthood
he
has
to
be
introduced
to
the
various
spirits
between
whom
and
mankind
it
will
be
his
office
to
mediate
a
priest
takes
him
to
an
open
window
and
while
the
drums
are
beating
points
out
to
him
the
great
spirit
in
the
sun
who
calls
away
men
to
himself
through
death
for
it
is
needful
that
the
future
priest
should
know
him
from
whose
grasp
he
will
often
be
expected
to
wrest
the
sick
and
dying
in
the
evening
twilight
he
is
led
to
the
graves
and
shewn
the
envious
spirits
of
the
dead
who
also
are
ever
drawing
away
the
living
to
their
own
shadowy
world
next
day
he
is
conducted
to
a
river
and
shewn
the
spirit
of
the
waters
and
finally
they
take
him
up
to
a
mountain
and
exhibit
to
him
the
spirits
of
the
mountains
who
have
diverse
shapes
some
appearing
like
swine
others
like
buffaloes
others
like
goats
and
others
again
like
men
with
long
hair
on
their
bodies
when
he
has
seen
all
this
his
education
is
complete
but
on
his
return
from
the
mountain
the
new
priest
may
not
at
once
enter
his
own
house
for
the
people
think
that
were
he
to
do
so
the
dangerous
spirits
by
whom
he
is
still
environed
would
stay
in
the
house
and
visit
both
the
family
and
the
pigs
with
sickness
accordingly
he
betakes
himself
to
other
villages
and
passes
several
nights
there
hoping
that
the
spirits
will
leave
him
and
settle
on
the
friends
who
receive
him
into
their
houses
but
naturally
he
does
not
reveal
the
intention
of
his
visits
to
his
hosts
lastly
before
he
enters
his
own
dwelling
he
looks
out
for
some
young
tree
by
the
way
splits
it
down
the
middle
and
then
creeps
through
the
fissure
in
the
belief
that
any
spirit
which
may
still
be
clinging
to
him
will
thus
be
left
sticking
to
the
tree
again
among
the
bilqula
or
bella
coola
indians
of
british
columbia
the
bed
of
a
mourner
must
be
protected
against
the
ghost
of
the
deceased
his
male
relatives
stick
a
into
the
ground
at
each
corner
of
their
beds
after
four
days
these
are
thrown
into
the
water
mourners
must
rise
early
and
go
into
the
woods
where
they
stick
four
into
the
ground
at
the
corners
of
a
square
in
which
they
cleanse
themselves
by
rubbing
their
bodies
with
cedar
branches
they
also
swim
in
ponds
after
swimming
they
cleave
four
small
trees
and
creep
through
the
clefts
following
the
course
of
the
sun
this
they
do
on
four
subsequent
mornings
cleaving
new
trees
every
day
mourners
cut
their
hair
short
the
hair
that
has
been
cut
off
is
burnt
if
they
should
not
observe
these
regulations
it
is
believed
that
they
would
dream
of
the
to
the
savage
who
fails
to
distinguish
the
visions
of
sleep
from
the
appearances
of
waking
life
the
apparition
of
a
dead
man
in
a
dream
is
equivalent
to
the
actual
presence
of
the
ghost
and
accordingly
he
seeks
to
keep
off
the
spiritual
intruder
just
as
he
might
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
by
fencing
his
bed
with
similarly
the
practice
of
creeping
through
four
cleft
trees
is
clearly
an
attempt
to
shake
off
the
clinging
ghost
and
leave
it
adhering
to
the
trees
just
as
in
nias
the
future
priest
hopes
to
rid
himself
in
like
manner
of
the
dangerous
spirits
who
have
dogged
his
steps
from
the
mountains
and
the
graves
this
interpretation
of
the
custom
is
strongly
confirmed
by
a
funeral
ceremony
which
charles
hose
witnessed
at
the
chief
village
of
the
madangs
a
tribe
of
kayans
who
occupy
a
hitherto
unexplored
district
in
the
heart
of
borneo
just
across
the
river
from
where
we
were
sitting
says
dr
hose
was
the
graveyard
and
there
i
witnessed
a
funeral
procession
as
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
coffin
which
was
a
wooden
box
made
from
a
was
decorated
with
red
and
black
patterns
in
circles
with
two
small
wooden
figures
of
men
placed
at
either
end
it
was
lashed
with
rattans
to
a
long
pole
and
by
this
means
was
lifted
to
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
who
numbered
thirteen
in
all
and
who
then
carried
it
to
the
after
the
mourners
had
all
passed
over
to
the
graveyard
a
man
quickly
cut
a
couple
of
small
sticks
each
five
feet
long
and
about
an
inch
in
diameter
one
of
these
he
split
almost
the
whole
way
down
and
forced
the
unsplit
end
into
the
ground
when
the
upper
part
opened
like
a
v
leaving
sufficient
room
for
each
person
to
pass
through
he
next
split
the
top
of
the
other
stick
and
placing
another
short
stick
in
the
cleft
made
a
cross
which
he
also
forced
into
the
ground
the
funeral
procession
climbed
the
mound
on
which
the
cemetery
was
situated
passing
through
the
v
of
the
cleft
stick
in
single
file
as
soon
as
the
coffin
had
been
placed
on
the
stage
erected
for
the
purpose
the
people
commenced
their
return
following
on
one
another
s
heels
as
quickly
as
possible
each
spitting
out
the
words
balli
krat
balli
jat
tesip
bertatip
keep
back
and
close
out
all
things
evil
and
sickness
as
they
passed
through
the
stick
the
whole
party
having
left
the
graveyard
the
gate
was
closed
by
the
simple
process
of
tying
the
cleft
ends
of
the
stick
together
and
a
few
words
were
then
said
to
the
which
they
call
or
the
wall
that
separates
the
living
from
the
dead
all
who
had
taken
part
in
the
ceremony
then
went
and
bathed
before
returning
to
their
homes
rubbing
their
skins
with
rough
pebbles
the
old
mosaic
idea
of
the
uncleanness
of
the
dead
as
mentioned
in
numbers
chap
xix
evidently
finding
a
place
among
their
religious
beliefs
it
is
apparently
a
great
relief
to
their
minds
to
think
that
they
can
shut
out
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
they
believe
that
the
spirit
of
the
dead
is
not
aware
that
life
has
left
the
body
until
a
short
time
after
the
coffin
has
been
taken
to
the
graveyard
and
then
not
until
the
spirit
has
had
leisure
to
notice
the
clothes
weapons
and
other
articles
belonging
to
its
earthly
estate
which
are
placed
with
the
coffin
but
before
this
takes
place
the
gate
has
been
here
the
words
uttered
by
the
mourners
in
passing
through
the
cloven
stick
shew
clearly
that
they
believe
the
stick
to
act
as
a
barrier
or
fence
on
the
further
side
of
which
they
leave
behind
the
ghost
or
other
dangerous
spirit
whose
successful
pursuit
might
entail
sickness
and
death
on
the
survivors
thus
the
passage
of
these
madang
mourners
through
the
cleft
stick
is
strictly
analogous
to
the
passage
of
ruptured
english
children
through
a
cleft
both
are
simply
ways
of
leaving
an
evil
thing
behind
similarly
the
subsequent
binding
up
of
the
cloven
stick
in
borneo
is
analogous
to
the
binding
up
of
the
cloven
in
england
both
are
ways
of
barricading
the
road
against
the
evil
which
is
dogging
your
steps
having
passed
through
the
doorway
you
slam
the
door
in
the
face
of
your
pursuer
yet
it
seems
probable
that
the
intention
of
binding
up
the
cleft
in
a
tree
through
which
a
ruptured
patient
has
been
passed
is
not
merely
that
of
shutting
the
door
on
the
malady
conceived
as
a
personal
being
combined
with
this
idea
is
perhaps
the
notion
that
in
virtue
of
the
law
of
magical
homoeopathy
the
rupture
in
the
body
of
the
sufferer
will
close
up
exactly
in
the
same
measure
as
the
cleft
in
the
tree
closes
up
through
the
force
of
bandages
and
of
natural
growth
that
this
shade
of
meaning
attaches
to
the
custom
is
rendered
probable
by
a
comparison
of
an
ancient
roman
cure
for
dislocation
which
has
been
preserved
for
us
by
the
grave
authority
of
the
elder
cato
he
recommended
that
a
green
reed
four
or
five
feet
long
should
be
taken
split
down
the
middle
and
held
by
two
men
to
the
dislocated
bones
while
a
curious
and
now
unintelligible
spell
was
recited
then
when
the
spell
had
been
recited
and
the
aperture
in
the
reed
had
closed
the
reed
was
to
be
tied
to
the
dislocated
limb
and
a
perfect
cure
might
be
expected
apparently
it
was
supposed
that
just
as
the
two
sides
of
the
split
reed
came
together
and
coalesced
after
being
held
apart
so
the
dislocated
bones
would
come
together
and
fit
into
their
proper
places
but
the
usual
idea
in
passing
through
a
narrow
aperture
as
a
cure
or
preventive
of
evil
would
seem
to
be
simply
that
of
giving
the
slip
to
a
dangerous
pursuer
with
this
intention
doubtless
the
savage
thays
of
tonquin
repair
after
a
burial
to
the
banks
of
a
stream
and
there
creep
through
a
triangle
formed
by
leaning
two
reeds
against
each
other
while
the
sorcerer
souses
them
with
dirty
water
all
the
relations
of
the
deceased
must
wash
their
garments
in
the
stream
before
they
return
home
and
they
may
not
set
foot
in
the
house
till
they
have
shorn
their
hair
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
afterwards
the
sorcerer
comes
and
sprinkles
the
whole
house
with
water
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
evil
spirits
here
again
we
can
not
doubt
that
the
creeping
through
the
triangle
of
reeds
is
intended
to
rid
the
mourners
of
the
troublesome
ghost
so
when
the
kamtchatkans
had
disposed
of
a
corpse
after
their
usual
fashion
by
throwing
it
to
the
dogs
to
be
devoured
they
purified
themselves
as
follows
they
went
into
the
forest
and
cut
various
roots
which
they
bent
into
rings
and
through
these
rings
they
crept
twice
afterwards
they
carried
the
rings
back
to
the
forest
and
flung
them
away
westward
the
koryaks
a
people
of
the
same
region
burn
their
dead
and
hold
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
departed
a
year
after
the
death
at
this
festival
which
takes
place
on
the
spot
where
the
corpse
was
burned
or
if
that
is
too
far
off
on
a
neighbouring
height
they
sacrifice
two
young
reindeer
which
have
never
been
in
harness
and
the
sorcerer
sticks
a
great
many
reindeer
horns
in
the
earth
believing
that
thereby
he
is
dispatching
a
whole
herd
of
these
animals
to
their
deceased
friend
in
the
other
world
then
they
all
hasten
home
and
purify
themselves
by
passing
between
two
poles
planted
in
the
ground
while
the
sorcerer
strikes
them
with
a
stick
and
adjures
death
not
to
carry
them
off
the
tokoelawi
in
the
interior
of
central
celebes
hold
a
great
sacrificial
festival
on
the
eighth
day
after
the
death
of
a
man
or
the
ninth
day
after
the
death
of
a
woman
when
the
guests
return
homewards
after
the
festival
they
pass
under
two
poles
placed
in
a
slanting
direction
against
each
other
and
they
may
not
look
round
at
the
house
where
the
death
occurred
in
this
way
they
take
a
final
leave
of
the
soul
of
the
deceased
afterwards
no
more
sacrifices
are
offered
to
the
among
the
toboengkoe
another
tribe
in
the
interior
of
central
celebes
when
a
man
buries
his
wife
he
goes
to
the
grave
by
a
different
road
from
that
along
which
the
corpse
is
carried
and
on
certain
days
afterwards
he
bathes
and
on
returning
from
the
bath
must
pass
through
a
erection
which
is
formed
by
splitting
a
pole
up
the
middle
and
separating
the
two
split
pieces
except
at
the
top
this
he
must
do
in
order
that
his
second
wife
if
he
has
one
may
not
soon
here
the
notion
probably
is
that
the
jealous
ghost
of
the
dead
wife
seeks
to
avenge
herself
on
her
living
rival
by
carrying
off
her
soul
with
her
to
deadland
hence
to
prevent
this
catastrophe
the
husband
tries
to
evade
the
ghost
first
by
going
to
the
grave
along
a
different
path
and
second
by
passing
under
a
cleft
stick
through
which
as
usual
the
spirit
can
not
follow
him
in
the
light
of
the
foregoing
customs
as
well
as
of
a
multitude
of
ceremonies
observed
for
a
similar
purpose
in
all
parts
of
the
world
we
may
safely
assume
that
when
people
creep
through
rings
after
a
death
or
pass
between
poles
after
a
sacrifice
to
the
dead
their
intention
simply
is
to
interpose
a
barrier
between
themselves
and
the
ghost
they
make
their
way
through
a
narrow
pass
or
aperture
through
which
they
hope
that
the
ghost
will
not
be
able
to
follow
them
to
put
it
otherwise
they
conceive
that
the
spirit
of
the
dead
is
sticking
to
them
like
a
burr
and
that
like
a
burr
it
may
be
rubbed
or
scraped
off
and
left
adhering
to
the
sides
of
the
opening
through
which
they
have
squeezed
themselves
similarly
when
a
pestilence
is
raging
among
the
koryaks
they
kill
a
dog
wind
its
guts
about
two
poles
and
pass
between
the
poles
doubtless
for
the
sake
of
giving
the
slip
to
the
demon
of
the
plague
in
the
same
way
that
they
give
the
slip
to
the
ghost
when
the
kayans
of
borneo
have
been
dogged
by
an
evil
spirit
on
a
journey
and
are
nearing
their
destination
they
fashion
a
small
archway
of
boughs
light
a
fire
under
it
and
pass
in
single
file
under
the
archway
and
over
the
fire
spitting
into
the
fire
as
they
pass
by
this
ceremony
we
are
told
they
thoroughly
exorcise
the
evil
spirits
and
emerge
on
the
other
side
free
from
all
baleful
here
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
a
fire
as
well
as
an
archway
is
interposed
between
the
travellers
and
the
dreadful
beings
who
are
walking
unseen
behind
to
crawl
under
a
bramble
which
has
formed
an
arch
by
sending
down
a
second
root
into
the
ground
is
an
english
and
welsh
cure
for
rheumatism
boils
and
other
complaints
in
some
parts
of
the
west
of
england
they
say
that
to
get
rid
of
boils
the
thing
to
do
is
to
crawl
through
such
a
natural
arch
nine
times
against
the
sun
but
in
devonshire
the
patient
should
creep
through
the
arch
thrice
with
the
sun
that
is
from
east
to
west
when
a
child
is
passed
through
it
for
the
operators
ought
to
say
bramble
out
cough
i
leave
the
in
perigord
and
other
parts
of
france
the
same
cure
is
employed
for
boils
in
bulgaria
when
a
person
suffers
from
a
congenital
malady
such
as
scrofula
a
popular
cure
is
to
take
him
to
a
neighbouring
village
and
there
make
him
creep
naked
thrice
through
an
arch
which
is
formed
by
inserting
the
lower
ends
of
two
vine
branches
in
the
ground
and
joining
their
upper
ends
together
when
he
has
done
so
he
hangs
his
clothes
on
a
tree
and
dons
other
garments
on
his
way
home
the
patient
must
also
crawl
under
a
ploughshare
which
is
held
high
enough
to
let
him
pass
further
when
is
prevalent
in
a
bulgarian
village
an
old
woman
will
scrape
the
earth
from
under
the
root
of
a
then
all
the
children
of
the
village
creep
through
the
opening
thus
made
and
a
thread
from
the
garment
of
each
of
them
is
hung
on
the
willow
adults
sometimes
go
through
the
same
ceremony
after
recovering
from
a
dangerous
illness
similarly
when
sickness
is
rife
among
some
of
the
villages
to
the
east
of
lake
nyassa
the
inhabitants
crawl
through
an
arch
formed
by
bending
a
wand
and
inserting
the
two
ends
in
the
ground
by
way
of
further
precaution
they
wash
themselves
on
the
spot
with
medicine
and
water
and
then
bury
the
medicine
and
the
evil
influence
together
in
the
earth
the
same
ceremony
is
resorted
to
as
a
means
of
keeping
off
evil
spirits
wild
beasts
and
enemies
in
uganda
sometimes
a
directed
a
sick
man
to
provide
an
animal
promising
that
he
would
come
and
transfer
the
sickness
to
the
animal
the
would
then
select
a
near
the
house
kill
the
animal
by
it
and
anoint
the
sick
man
with
its
blood
on
his
forehead
on
each
side
of
his
chest
and
on
his
legs
above
the
knees
the
selected
had
to
be
one
that
was
about
to
bear
fruit
and
the
would
split
the
stem
from
near
the
top
to
near
the
bottom
leaving
a
few
inches
not
split
both
at
the
top
and
at
the
bottom
the
split
stem
would
be
held
open
so
that
the
sick
man
could
step
through
it
and
in
doing
so
he
would
leave
his
clothing
at
the
and
would
run
into
the
house
without
looking
back
when
he
entered
the
house
new
clothes
would
be
given
him
to
wear
the
plantain
the
clothing
and
meat
would
be
carried
away
by
the
who
would
deposit
the
on
waste
land
but
would
take
the
meat
and
clothing
for
himself
sometimes
the
would
kill
the
animal
near
the
hut
lay
a
stout
stick
across
the
threshold
and
narrow
the
doorway
by
partially
filling
it
with
branches
of
trees
he
would
then
put
some
of
the
blood
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
entrance
and
some
on
the
stick
across
the
threshold
and
would
also
anoint
with
it
the
sick
man
who
would
be
taken
outside
for
the
purpose
the
patient
would
then
the
house
letting
his
clothing
fall
off
as
he
passed
through
the
doorway
the
would
carry
away
the
branches
the
stick
the
clothing
and
the
meat
the
branches
and
the
stick
he
would
cast
upon
waste
land
but
the
meat
and
the
clothing
he
would
keep
for
here
the
notion
of
transferring
the
sickness
to
the
animal
is
plainly
combined
with
we
may
almost
say
overshadowed
by
the
notion
that
the
ailment
is
left
behind
adhering
to
the
cleft
or
to
the
stick
and
branches
of
the
narrow
opening
through
which
the
patient
has
made
his
way
that
obviously
is
why
the
or
the
stick
and
branches
are
thrown
away
on
waste
land
lest
they
should
infect
other
people
with
the
sickness
which
has
been
transferred
to
them
the
kai
of
german
new
guinea
attribute
sickness
to
the
agency
either
of
ghosts
or
of
sorcerers
but
suspicion
always
falls
at
first
on
ghosts
who
are
deemed
even
worse
than
the
sorcerers
to
cure
a
sick
man
they
will
sometimes
cleave
a
stick
in
the
middle
leaving
the
two
ends
intact
and
then
oblige
the
sufferer
to
insert
his
head
through
the
cleft
after
that
they
stroke
his
whole
body
with
the
stick
from
head
to
foot
the
stick
with
the
of
the
ghosts
is
then
hurled
away
or
otherwise
destroyed
whereupon
the
sick
man
is
supposed
to
here
the
ghosts
who
cause
the
sickness
are
clearly
supposed
to
be
scraped
from
the
patient
s
body
by
means
of
the
cleft
stick
and
to
be
thrown
away
or
destroyed
with
the
implement
the
looboos
a
primitive
tribe
in
the
mandailing
district
of
sumatra
stand
in
great
fear
of
the
wandering
spirits
of
the
dead
but
they
know
all
sorts
of
means
of
protecting
themselves
against
the
unwelcome
visits
of
the
spirits
for
example
if
a
man
has
lost
his
way
in
the
forest
he
thinks
that
this
is
the
work
of
such
a
spirit
who
dogs
the
wanderer
and
bedims
his
sight
so
in
order
to
throw
the
malignant
spirit
off
the
track
he
takes
a
rattan
and
splits
it
through
the
middle
by
bending
the
rattan
an
opening
is
made
through
which
he
creeps
after
that
the
rattan
is
quickly
stretched
and
the
opening
closes
by
this
procedure
the
spirit
so
they
think
can
not
find
the
opening
again
and
so
can
not
further
follow
his
here
therefore
the
passage
through
a
cleft
stick
is
conceived
in
the
clearest
way
as
an
escape
from
a
spiritual
pursuer
and
the
closing
of
the
aperture
when
the
fugitive
has
passed
through
it
is
nothing
but
the
slamming
of
the
door
in
the
face
of
his
invisible
foe
a
similar
significance
is
probably
to
be
attached
to
other
cases
of
ceremonially
passing
through
a
cleft
stick
even
where
the
intention
of
the
rite
is
not
expressly
alleged
thus
among
the
ovambo
of
german
africa
young
women
who
have
become
marriageable
perform
a
variety
of
ceremonies
among
other
things
they
dance
in
the
large
and
the
small
on
quitting
the
large
after
the
dance
and
on
entering
and
quitting
the
small
they
are
obliged
to
pass
one
after
the
other
through
the
fork
of
a
cleft
stick
of
which
the
two
sides
are
held
wide
open
by
an
old
man
among
the
washamba
of
german
east
africa
when
a
boy
has
been
circumcised
two
women
bring
a
long
which
still
bears
its
leaves
the
cane
is
split
at
some
distance
from
its
upper
and
lower
ends
and
the
two
sides
are
held
apart
so
as
to
form
a
cleft
or
opening
at
the
lower
end
of
the
cleft
a
ring
is
fastened
the
father
and
mother
of
the
circumcised
youth
now
place
the
between
them
touch
the
ring
with
their
feet
and
then
slip
through
the
cleft
and
after
them
the
lad
s
aunt
must
also
pass
through
the
cleft
in
both
these
cases
the
passage
through
the
cleft
stick
is
probably
intended
to
give
the
slip
to
certain
dangerous
spirits
which
are
apt
to
molest
people
at
such
critical
seasons
as
puberty
and
circumcision
again
the
passage
through
a
ring
or
hoop
is
resorted
to
for
like
reasons
as
a
mode
of
curing
or
preventing
disease
thus
in
sweden
when
a
natural
ring
has
been
found
in
a
tree
it
is
carefully
removed
and
treasured
in
the
family
for
sick
and
especially
rickety
children
are
healed
by
merely
passing
through
it
a
young
married
woman
in
sweden
who
suffered
from
an
infirmity
was
advised
by
a
wise
woman
to
steal
three
branches
of
willow
make
them
into
a
hoop
and
creep
through
it
naked
taking
care
not
to
touch
the
hoop
and
to
keep
perfectly
silent
the
hoop
was
afterwards
to
be
burnt
she
carried
out
the
prescription
faithfully
and
her
faith
was
rewarded
by
a
perfect
cure
no
doubt
her
infirmity
was
thought
to
adhere
to
the
hoop
and
to
be
burnt
with
it
similarly
in
scotland
children
who
suffered
from
hectic
fever
and
consumptive
patients
used
to
be
healed
by
passing
thrice
through
a
circular
wreath
of
woodbine
which
was
cut
during
the
increase
of
the
march
moon
and
was
let
down
over
the
body
of
the
sufferer
from
the
head
to
the
feet
thus
jonet
stewart
cured
sundry
women
by
taking
ane
garland
of
grene
woodbynd
and
causing
the
patient
pas
thryis
throw
it
quhilk
thairefter
scho
cut
in
nyne
pieces
and
cast
in
the
another
wise
woman
transmitted
the
sick
throw
are
girth
of
woodbind
thryis
thre
times
saying
i
do
this
in
name
of
the
father
the
sone
and
the
halie
the
highlanders
of
strathspey
used
to
force
all
their
sheep
and
lambs
to
pass
through
a
hoop
of
on
all
saints
day
and
beltane
the
first
of
november
and
the
first
of
may
probably
as
a
means
of
warding
off
the
witches
and
fairies
who
are
especially
dreaded
at
these
seasons
and
against
whose
malignant
arts
the
affords
an
efficient
protection
in
oldenburg
when
a
cow
gives
little
or
no
milk
they
milk
her
through
a
hole
in
a
branch
in
eversten
they
say
that
this
should
be
done
through
a
ring
which
an
has
formed
round
the
scar
where
a
branch
has
been
sawn
off
others
say
the
beast
should
be
milked
through
a
witch
s
nest
that
is
through
the
boughs
of
a
which
have
grown
in
a
tangle
such
a
witch
s
nest
is
also
hung
up
in
a
pig
s
stye
to
protect
the
pig
against
witchcraft
hence
the
aim
of
milking
a
cow
through
a
witch
s
nest
or
through
a
natural
wooden
ring
is
no
doubt
to
deliver
the
poor
creature
from
an
artful
witch
who
has
been
draining
away
the
milk
into
her
own
pail
as
witches
are
too
apt
to
do
again
in
oldenburg
sick
children
and
also
adults
and
animals
are
passed
through
a
ring
of
rough
unwashed
yarn
just
as
it
comes
from
the
reel
to
complete
the
cure
you
should
throw
a
hot
coal
thrice
through
the
ring
then
spit
through
it
thrice
and
finally
bury
the
yarn
under
a
stone
where
you
leave
it
to
rot
the
writer
who
reports
these
remedies
explains
them
as
intended
to
strip
the
witchcraft
as
you
might
say
from
the
bodies
of
the
victims
whether
human
or
animal
on
whom
the
witch
has
cast
her
spell
among
the
lushais
of
assam
five
to
ten
days
after
the
child
is
born
its
body
is
said
to
be
covered
with
small
pimples
its
lips
become
black
and
its
strength
decreases
the
family
then
obtain
a
particular
kind
of
creeping
plant
called
which
they
make
into
a
coil
in
the
evening
everything
in
the
house
that
has
a
lid
or
covering
is
uncovered
and
the
child
is
thrice
passed
through
this
coil
which
act
is
supposed
to
clear
the
child
s
skin
and
restore
its
strength
after
this
is
finished
the
parents
go
to
bed
and
the
pots
or
other
receptacles
are
covered
again
by
any
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
the
parents
themselves
must
not
replace
any
of
these
lids
for
fear
that
they
might
shut
up
the
spirit
of
the
child
in
when
the
kwakiutl
indians
of
british
columbia
fear
the
outbreak
of
an
epidemic
a
takes
a
large
ring
of
hemlock
branches
and
causes
every
member
of
the
tribe
to
pass
through
it
each
person
puts
his
head
through
the
ring
and
then
moves
the
ring
downwards
over
his
body
till
it
has
almost
reached
his
feet
when
he
steps
out
of
it
right
foot
first
they
think
that
this
prevents
the
epidemic
from
breaking
out
in
asia
minor
if
a
person
is
believed
to
be
possessed
by
an
evil
spirit
one
form
of
treatment
is
to
heat
an
form
it
into
a
ring
and
pass
the
afflicted
person
through
the
opening
on
the
theory
that
the
evil
spirit
can
not
pass
the
hot
chain
and
so
is
torn
from
his
victim
and
left
here
the
intention
of
the
passage
through
the
aperture
is
avowedly
to
shake
off
a
spiritual
pursuer
who
is
deterred
from
further
pursuit
not
only
by
the
narrowness
of
the
opening
but
by
the
risk
of
burning
himself
in
the
attempt
to
make
his
way
through
it
but
if
the
intention
of
these
ceremonies
is
essentially
to
rid
the
performer
of
some
harmful
thing
whether
a
disease
or
a
ghost
or
a
demon
which
is
supposed
to
be
clinging
to
him
we
should
expect
to
find
that
any
narrow
hole
or
opening
would
serve
the
purpose
as
well
as
a
cleft
tree
or
stick
an
arch
or
ring
of
boughs
or
a
couple
of
posts
fixed
in
the
ground
and
this
expectation
is
not
disappointed
on
the
coast
of
morven
and
mull
thin
ledges
of
rock
may
be
seen
pierced
with
large
holes
near
the
sea
consumptive
people
used
to
be
brought
thither
and
after
the
tops
of
nine
waves
had
been
caught
in
a
dish
and
thrown
on
the
patient
s
head
he
was
made
to
pass
through
one
of
the
rifted
rocks
thrice
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
on
the
farm
of
crossapol
in
coll
there
is
a
stone
called
that
is
the
hole
stone
through
which
persons
suffering
from
consumption
were
made
to
pass
three
times
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
they
took
meat
with
them
each
time
and
left
some
on
the
stone
the
bird
that
took
the
food
away
had
the
consumption
laid
upon
it
similar
stones
under
which
the
patient
can
creep
were
made
use
of
in
other
here
it
is
manifest
that
the
patient
left
his
disease
behind
him
on
the
stone
since
the
bird
which
carried
off
the
food
from
the
stone
caught
the
disease
in
the
aberdeenshire
river
dee
at
cambus
o
may
near
ballater
there
is
a
rock
with
a
hole
in
it
large
enough
to
let
a
person
pass
through
legend
runs
that
childless
women
used
to
wade
out
to
the
stone
and
squeeze
themselves
through
the
hole
it
is
said
that
a
certain
noble
lady
tried
the
effect
of
the
charm
not
very
many
years
ago
with
indifferent
success
in
the
parish
of
madern
in
cornwall
near
the
village
of
lanyon
there
is
a
perforated
stone
called
the
or
holed
stone
through
which
people
formerly
crept
as
a
remedy
for
pains
in
the
back
and
limbs
and
at
certain
times
of
the
year
parents
drew
their
children
through
the
hole
to
cure
them
of
the
rickets
the
passage
through
the
stone
was
also
deemed
a
cure
for
scrofula
provided
it
was
made
against
the
sun
and
repeated
three
times
or
three
times
three
near
the
little
town
of
dourgne
not
far
from
castres
in
southern
france
there
is
a
mountain
and
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
is
a
tableland
where
a
number
of
large
stones
may
be
seen
planted
in
the
ground
about
a
cross
and
rising
to
a
height
of
two
to
five
feet
above
the
ground
almost
all
of
them
are
pierced
with
holes
of
different
sizes
from
time
immemorial
people
used
to
assemble
at
dourgne
and
the
neighbourhood
every
year
on
the
sixth
of
august
the
festival
of
estapin
the
palsied
the
lame
the
blind
the
sick
of
all
sorts
flocked
thither
to
seek
and
find
a
cure
for
their
various
infirmities
very
early
in
the
morning
they
set
out
from
the
villages
where
they
had
lodged
or
from
the
meadows
where
for
want
of
better
accommodation
they
had
been
forced
to
pass
the
night
and
went
on
pilgrimage
to
the
chapel
of
estapin
which
stands
in
a
gorge
at
the
southern
foot
of
the
mountain
having
gone
nine
times
in
procession
round
the
chapel
they
hobbled
limped
or
crawled
to
the
tableland
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
there
each
of
them
chose
a
stone
with
a
hole
of
the
requisite
size
and
thrust
his
ailing
member
through
the
hole
for
there
are
holes
to
suit
every
complaint
some
for
the
head
some
for
the
arm
some
for
the
leg
and
so
on
having
performed
this
simple
ceremony
they
were
cured
the
lame
walked
the
blind
saw
the
palsied
recovered
the
use
of
their
limbs
and
so
on
the
chapel
of
the
saint
is
adorned
with
the
crutches
and
other
artificial
aids
now
wholly
superfluous
which
the
joyful
pilgrims
left
behind
them
in
token
of
their
gratitude
and
devotion
about
two
miles
from
gisors
in
the
french
department
of
oise
there
is
a
dolmen
called
trie
or
chateau
consisting
of
three
upright
stones
with
a
fourth
and
larger
stone
laid
horizontally
on
their
tops
the
stone
which
forms
the
back
wall
of
the
dolmen
is
pierced
about
the
middle
by
an
irregularly
shaped
hole
through
which
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
used
from
time
immemorial
to
pass
their
sickly
children
in
the
firm
belief
that
the
passage
through
the
stone
would
restore
them
to
health
in
the
church
of
corona
at
the
village
of
koppenwal
in
lower
bavaria
there
is
a
hole
in
the
stone
on
which
the
altar
rests
through
this
hole
while
service
was
going
on
the
peasants
used
to
creep
believing
that
having
done
so
they
would
not
suffer
from
pains
in
their
back
at
harvest
in
the
crypt
of
the
old
cathedral
at
freising
in
bavaria
there
is
a
tomb
which
is
reputed
to
contain
the
relics
of
nonnosius
between
a
pillar
of
the
tomb
and
the
wall
there
is
a
narrow
opening
through
which
persons
afflicted
with
pains
in
the
back
creep
in
order
to
obtain
thereby
some
mitigation
of
their
pangs
in
upper
austria
above
the
lake
of
aber
which
is
a
sheet
of
water
nestling
among
wooded
mountains
there
stands
the
falkenstein
chapel
of
wolfgang
built
close
to
the
face
of
a
cliff
that
rises
from
a
little
green
dale
a
staircase
leads
up
from
the
chapel
to
a
narrow
dark
dripping
cleft
in
the
rock
through
which
pilgrims
creep
in
a
stooping
posture
in
the
belief
that
they
can
strip
off
their
bodily
sufferings
or
sins
on
the
face
of
the
women
with
child
also
crawl
through
the
hole
hoping
thus
to
obtain
an
easy
delivery
in
the
greek
island
of
cythnos
when
a
child
is
sickly
the
mother
will
take
it
to
a
hole
in
a
rock
about
half
an
hour
distant
from
messaria
there
she
strips
the
child
naked
and
pushes
it
through
the
hole
in
the
rock
afterwards
throwing
away
the
old
garments
and
clothing
the
child
in
new
ones
near
everek
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
caesarea
in
asia
minor
there
is
a
rifted
rock
through
which
persons
pass
to
rid
themselves
of
a
cough
a
writer
well
acquainted
with
asia
minor
has
described
how
he
visited
a
pool
of
water
tucked
away
in
a
beautiful
nook
high
up
among
the
anatolian
mountains
and
with
a
wide
reputation
for
sanctity
and
healing
powers
we
arrived
just
as
the
last
of
a
flock
of
three
hundred
sheep
were
being
passed
through
a
peculiar
hole
in
the
thin
ledge
of
a
huge
rock
to
deliver
them
from
a
disease
of
the
liver
supposed
to
prevent
the
proper
laying
on
of
among
the
kawars
of
the
central
provinces
in
india
a
man
who
suffers
from
intermittent
fever
will
try
to
cure
it
by
walking
through
a
narrow
passage
between
two
houses
in
a
ruined
church
of
brandon
about
ten
miles
from
dingle
in
the
west
of
ireland
there
is
a
narrow
window
through
which
sick
women
pass
thrice
in
order
to
be
cured
the
hindoos
of
the
punjaub
think
that
the
birth
of
a
son
after
three
girls
is
unlucky
for
the
parents
and
in
order
to
avert
the
they
resort
to
a
number
of
devices
amongst
other
things
they
break
the
centre
of
a
bronze
plate
and
remove
all
but
the
rim
then
they
pass
the
luckless
child
through
the
bronze
rim
moreover
they
make
an
opening
in
the
roof
of
the
room
where
the
birth
took
place
and
then
pull
the
infant
out
through
the
opening
and
further
they
pass
the
child
under
the
sill
of
the
door
by
these
passages
through
narrow
apertures
they
apparently
hope
to
rid
the
child
of
the
which
is
either
pursuing
it
or
sticking
to
it
like
a
burr
for
in
this
case
as
in
many
similar
ones
it
might
be
hard
to
say
whether
the
riddance
is
conceived
as
an
escape
from
the
pursuit
of
a
maleficent
spirit
or
as
the
abrasion
of
a
dangerous
substance
which
adheres
to
the
person
of
the
sufferer
another
way
of
ridding
man
and
beast
of
the
clinging
infection
of
disease
is
to
pass
them
through
a
hole
dug
in
the
ground
this
mode
of
cure
was
practised
in
europe
during
the
middle
ages
and
has
survived
in
denmark
down
to
modern
times
in
a
sermon
preached
by
eloi
bishop
of
noyon
in
the
sixth
century
he
forbade
the
faithful
to
practise
lustrations
and
to
drive
their
sheep
through
hollow
trees
and
holes
in
the
earth
because
by
this
they
seem
to
consecrate
them
to
the
theodore
archbishop
of
canterbury
who
died
in
decreed
that
if
any
one
for
the
health
of
his
little
son
shall
pass
through
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
then
close
it
behind
him
with
thorns
let
him
do
penance
for
eleven
days
on
bread
and
here
the
closing
of
the
hole
with
thorns
after
the
patient
or
his
representative
has
passed
through
is
plainly
intended
to
barricade
the
narrow
way
against
the
pursuit
of
sickness
personified
as
a
demon
hence
it
confirms
the
general
interpretation
here
given
of
these
customs
again
burchard
bishop
of
worms
who
died
in
repeated
the
same
condemnation
hast
thou
done
what
certain
women
are
wont
to
do
i
mean
those
who
have
squalling
babes
they
dig
the
earth
and
pierce
it
and
through
that
hole
they
drag
the
babe
and
they
say
that
thus
the
squalling
babe
ceases
to
squall
if
thou
has
done
this
or
consented
unto
it
thou
shalt
do
penance
for
fifteen
days
on
bread
and
at
fünen
in
denmark
as
late
as
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
cure
for
childish
ailments
was
to
dig
up
several
sods
arrange
them
so
as
to
form
a
hole
and
then
to
pass
the
sick
child
through
it
a
simplified
form
of
this
cure
is
adopted
in
jutland
at
twelve
o
clock
on
a
thursday
night
you
go
to
a
churchyard
dig
up
a
circular
piece
of
turf
and
make
a
hole
in
it
large
enough
to
permit
the
passage
through
it
of
your
infant
progeny
taking
the
sod
with
you
go
home
salute
nobody
on
the
way
and
speak
to
nobody
on
getting
to
your
house
take
the
child
and
pass
it
thrice
through
the
turf
from
right
to
left
then
take
the
turf
back
to
the
churchyard
and
replace
it
in
position
if
the
turf
takes
root
and
grows
afresh
the
child
will
recover
but
if
the
turf
withers
there
is
no
hope
elsewhere
it
is
at
the
hour
of
sunset
rather
than
of
midnight
that
people
cut
the
turf
in
the
churchyard
the
same
cure
is
applied
to
cattle
which
have
been
bewitched
though
naturally
in
that
case
you
must
cut
a
much
bigger
turf
and
make
a
much
bigger
hole
in
it
to
let
a
horse
or
a
cow
through
than
is
necessary
for
an
infant
here
again
the
conception
of
a
sympathetic
relation
established
between
the
sufferer
and
the
thing
which
has
rid
him
of
his
ailment
comes
out
clearly
in
the
belief
that
if
the
turf
through
which
the
child
has
been
passed
thrives
the
child
will
thrive
also
but
that
if
the
turf
withers
the
child
will
die
among
the
corannas
a
people
of
the
hottentot
race
on
the
orange
river
when
a
child
recovers
from
a
dangerous
illness
a
trench
is
dug
in
the
ground
across
the
middle
of
which
an
arch
is
thrown
and
an
ox
made
to
stand
upon
it
the
child
is
then
dragged
under
the
arch
after
this
ceremony
the
animal
is
killed
and
eaten
by
married
people
who
have
children
none
else
being
permitted
to
participate
of
the
here
the
attempt
to
leave
the
sickness
behind
in
the
hole
which
is
probably
the
essence
of
the
ceremony
may
perhaps
be
combined
with
an
endeavour
to
impart
to
the
child
the
strength
and
vigour
of
the
animal
ancient
india
seems
also
to
have
been
familiar
with
the
same
primitive
notion
that
sickness
could
as
it
were
be
stripped
off
the
person
of
the
sufferer
by
passing
him
through
a
narrow
aperture
for
in
the
rigveda
it
is
said
that
indra
cured
apala
of
a
disease
of
the
skin
by
drawing
her
through
the
yoke
of
the
chariot
thus
the
god
made
her
to
have
a
golden
skin
purifying
her
at
the
small
village
of
damun
on
the
kabenau
river
in
german
new
guinea
a
traveller
witnessed
the
natives
performing
a
ceremony
of
initiation
of
which
the
following
rite
formed
part
the
candidates
for
initiation
six
in
number
were
boys
and
lads
of
various
ages
from
about
four
years
of
age
to
sixteen
or
seventeen
the
company
betook
themselves
to
the
bed
of
a
small
stream
where
at
the
end
of
a
gully
a
hollow
in
the
rocks
formed
a
natural
basin
at
the
entrance
to
the
gully
a
sort
of
yoke
so
the
traveller
calls
it
was
erected
by
means
of
some
poles
and
from
the
plants
were
hung
so
as
to
make
an
arch
one
of
the
men
took
up
his
station
in
front
of
the
arch
and
as
each
candidate
came
up
the
man
seized
him
spat
on
his
breast
and
back
a
clot
of
red
spittle
and
gave
him
several
severe
blows
with
the
stock
of
a
plant
after
that
the
candidate
who
had
previously
stripped
himself
naked
passed
under
the
leafy
arch
and
bathed
in
the
rocky
pool
at
the
other
end
of
the
gully
all
the
time
that
this
solemnity
was
proceeding
another
man
sat
perched
on
a
neighbouring
rock
beating
a
drum
and
singing
only
men
took
part
in
the
ceremony
though
no
explanation
of
the
ceremony
is
given
by
the
observer
who
witnessed
it
we
may
suppose
that
by
passing
under
the
yoke
or
arch
the
novices
were
supposed
to
rid
themselves
of
certain
evil
influences
whether
conceived
as
spiritual
or
not
which
they
left
behind
them
on
the
further
side
of
the
barrier
this
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
bath
which
each
candidate
took
immediately
afterwards
in
short
the
whole
purpose
of
the
rite
would
seem
to
have
been
purificatory
with
the
preceding
examples
before
us
it
seems
worth
while
to
ask
whether
the
ancient
italian
practice
of
making
conquered
enemies
to
pass
under
a
yoke
may
not
in
its
origin
have
been
a
purificatory
ceremony
designed
to
rid
the
foe
of
some
uncanny
powers
before
dismissing
him
to
his
home
for
apparently
the
ceremony
was
only
observed
with
prisoners
who
were
about
to
be
released
had
it
been
a
mere
mark
of
ignominy
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
been
inflicted
also
on
men
who
were
doomed
to
die
this
conjectural
explanation
of
the
ceremony
is
confirmed
by
the
tradition
that
the
roman
horatius
was
similarly
obliged
by
his
to
pass
under
a
yoke
as
a
form
of
purification
for
the
murder
of
his
sister
the
yoke
by
passing
under
which
he
cleansed
himself
from
his
sister
s
blood
was
still
to
be
seen
in
rome
when
livy
was
writing
his
history
under
the
emperor
augustus
it
was
an
ancient
wooden
beam
spanning
a
narrow
lane
in
an
old
quarter
of
the
city
the
two
ends
of
the
beam
being
built
into
the
masonry
of
the
walls
on
either
side
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
sister
s
beam
and
whenever
the
wood
decayed
and
threatened
to
fall
the
venerable
monument
which
carried
back
the
thoughts
of
to
the
kingly
age
of
rome
was
repaired
at
the
public
expense
if
our
interpretation
of
these
customs
is
right
it
was
the
ghost
of
his
murdered
sister
whom
the
roman
hero
gave
the
slip
to
by
passing
under
the
yoke
and
it
may
have
been
the
angry
ghosts
of
slaughtered
romans
from
whom
the
enemy
s
soldiers
were
believed
to
be
delivered
when
they
marched
under
the
yoke
before
being
dismissed
by
their
merciful
conquerors
to
their
homes
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
we
saw
that
homicides
in
general
and
victorious
warriors
in
particular
are
often
obliged
to
perform
a
variety
of
ceremonies
for
the
purpose
of
ridding
them
of
the
dangerous
ghosts
of
their
victims
if
the
ceremony
of
passing
under
the
yoke
was
primarily
designed
as
i
have
suggested
to
free
the
soldiers
from
the
angry
ghosts
of
the
men
whom
they
had
slain
we
should
expect
to
find
that
the
victorious
romans
themselves
observed
a
similar
ceremony
after
a
battle
for
a
similar
purpose
was
this
the
original
meaning
of
passing
under
a
triumphal
arch
in
other
words
may
not
the
triumphal
arch
have
been
for
the
victors
what
the
yoke
was
for
the
vanquished
a
barrier
to
protect
them
against
the
pursuit
of
the
spirits
of
the
slain
that
the
romans
felt
the
need
of
purification
from
the
taint
of
bloodshed
after
a
battle
appears
from
the
opinion
of
masurius
mentioned
by
pliny
that
the
laurel
worn
by
soldiers
in
a
triumphal
procession
was
intended
to
purge
them
from
the
slaughter
of
the
enemy
a
special
gate
the
was
reserved
for
the
entrance
of
a
victorious
army
into
rome
and
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
ancient
religious
views
if
this
distinction
was
originally
not
so
much
an
honour
conferred
as
a
precaution
enforced
to
prevent
the
ordinary
gates
from
being
polluted
by
the
passage
of
thousands
of
men
the
external
soul
in
animals
but
in
practice
as
in
it
is
not
merely
with
inanimate
objects
and
plants
that
a
person
is
occasionally
believed
to
be
united
by
a
bond
of
physical
sympathy
the
same
bond
it
is
supposed
may
exist
between
a
man
and
an
animal
so
that
the
welfare
of
the
one
depends
on
the
welfare
of
the
other
and
when
the
animal
dies
the
man
dies
also
the
analogy
between
the
custom
and
the
tales
is
all
the
closer
because
in
both
of
them
the
power
of
thus
removing
the
soul
from
the
body
and
stowing
it
away
in
an
animal
is
often
a
special
privilege
of
wizards
and
witches
thus
the
yakuts
of
siberia
believe
that
every
shaman
or
wizard
keeps
his
soul
or
one
of
his
souls
incarnate
in
an
animal
which
is
carefully
concealed
from
all
the
world
nobody
can
find
my
external
soul
said
one
famous
wizard
it
lies
hidden
far
away
in
the
stony
mountains
of
only
once
a
year
when
the
last
snows
melt
and
the
earth
turns
black
do
these
external
souls
of
wizards
appear
in
the
shape
of
animals
among
the
dwellings
of
men
they
wander
everywhere
yet
none
but
wizards
can
see
them
the
strong
ones
sweep
roaring
and
noisily
along
the
weak
steal
about
quietly
and
furtively
often
they
fight
and
then
the
wizard
whose
external
soul
is
beaten
falls
ill
or
dies
the
weakest
and
most
cowardly
wizards
are
they
whose
souls
are
incarnate
in
the
shape
of
dogs
for
the
dog
gives
his
human
double
no
peace
but
gnaws
his
heart
and
tears
his
body
the
most
powerful
wizards
are
they
whose
external
souls
have
the
shape
of
stallions
elks
black
bears
eagles
or
boars
again
the
samoyeds
of
the
turukhinsk
region
hold
that
every
shaman
has
a
familiar
spirit
in
the
shape
of
a
boar
which
he
leads
about
by
a
magic
belt
on
the
death
of
the
boar
the
shaman
himself
dies
and
stories
are
told
of
battles
between
wizards
who
send
their
spirits
to
fight
before
they
encounter
each
other
in
person
in
yorkshire
witches
are
thought
to
stand
in
such
peculiarly
close
relations
to
hares
that
if
a
particular
hare
is
killed
or
wounded
a
certain
witch
will
at
the
same
moment
be
killed
or
receive
a
hurt
in
her
body
exactly
corresponding
to
the
wound
in
the
hare
however
this
fancy
is
probably
a
case
of
the
general
european
belief
that
witches
have
the
power
of
temporarily
transforming
themselves
into
certain
animals
particularly
hares
and
cats
and
that
any
hurts
inflicted
on
such
transformed
animals
are
felt
by
the
witches
who
are
concealed
in
the
animals
but
the
notion
that
a
person
can
temporarily
transform
himself
into
an
animal
differs
from
the
notion
that
he
can
deposit
his
soul
for
a
longer
or
shorter
period
in
an
animal
while
he
himself
retains
the
human
form
though
in
the
cloudy
mind
of
the
peasant
and
the
savage
the
two
ideas
may
not
always
be
sharply
distinguished
the
malays
believe
that
the
soul
of
a
person
may
pass
into
another
person
or
into
an
animal
or
rather
that
such
a
mysterious
relation
can
arise
between
the
two
that
the
fate
of
the
one
is
wholly
dependent
on
that
of
the
among
the
melanesians
of
mota
one
of
the
new
hebrides
islands
the
conception
of
an
external
soul
is
carried
out
in
the
practice
of
daily
life
the
mota
word
for
soul
is
the
use
of
the
word
in
mota
seems
properly
and
originally
to
have
been
to
signify
something
peculiarly
and
intimately
connected
with
a
person
and
sacred
to
him
something
that
he
has
set
his
fancy
upon
when
he
has
seen
it
in
what
has
seemed
to
him
a
wonderful
manner
or
some
one
has
shewn
it
to
him
as
such
whatever
the
thing
might
be
the
man
believed
it
to
be
the
reflection
of
his
own
personality
he
and
his
flourished
suffered
lived
and
died
together
but
the
word
must
not
be
supposed
to
have
been
borrowed
from
this
use
and
applied
secondarily
to
describe
the
soul
the
word
carries
a
sense
with
it
which
is
applicable
alike
to
that
second
self
the
visible
object
so
mysteriously
connected
with
the
man
and
to
this
invisible
second
self
which
we
call
the
soul
there
is
another
mota
word
which
has
almost
if
not
quite
the
same
meaning
as
has
when
it
describes
something
animate
or
inanimate
which
a
man
has
come
to
believe
to
have
an
existence
intimately
connected
with
his
own
the
word
may
be
taken
to
be
properly
likeness
and
the
noun
form
of
the
adverb
as
like
it
was
not
every
one
in
mota
who
had
his
only
some
men
fancied
that
they
had
this
relation
to
a
lizard
a
snake
or
it
might
be
a
stone
sometimes
the
thing
was
sought
for
and
found
by
drinking
the
infusion
of
certain
leaves
and
heaping
together
the
dregs
then
whatever
living
thing
was
first
seen
in
or
upon
the
heap
was
the
it
was
watched
but
not
fed
or
worshipped
the
natives
believed
that
it
came
at
call
and
that
the
life
of
the
man
was
bound
up
with
the
life
of
his
if
a
living
thing
or
with
its
safety
should
it
die
or
if
not
living
get
broken
or
be
lost
the
man
would
die
hence
in
case
of
sickness
they
would
send
to
see
if
the
was
safe
and
well
this
word
has
never
been
used
apparently
for
the
soul
in
mota
but
in
aurora
in
the
new
hebrides
it
is
the
accepted
equivalent
it
is
well
worth
observing
that
both
the
and
the
and
it
may
be
added
the
motlav
is
something
which
has
a
substantial
existence
of
its
own
as
when
a
snake
or
stone
is
a
man
s
or
a
soul
then
when
called
by
these
names
is
conceived
of
as
something
in
a
way
from
this
account
which
we
owe
to
the
careful
and
accurate
researches
of
the
rev
codrington
we
gather
that
while
every
person
in
mota
has
a
second
self
or
external
soul
in
a
visible
object
called
an
only
some
people
have
it
may
be
a
second
external
soul
in
another
visible
object
called
a
we
may
conjecture
that
persons
who
have
a
in
addition
to
an
are
more
than
usually
anxious
as
to
the
state
of
their
soul
and
that
they
seek
to
put
it
in
perfect
security
by
what
we
may
call
a
system
of
double
insurance
calculating
that
if
one
of
their
external
souls
should
die
or
be
broken
they
themselves
may
still
survive
by
virtue
of
the
survival
of
the
other
be
that
as
it
may
the
discharges
two
functions
one
of
them
defensive
and
the
other
offensive
on
the
one
hand
so
long
as
it
lives
or
remains
unbroken
it
preserves
its
owner
in
life
and
on
the
other
hand
it
helps
him
to
injure
his
enemies
in
its
offensive
character
if
the
happens
to
be
an
eel
it
will
bite
its
owner
s
enemy
if
it
is
a
shark
it
will
swallow
him
in
its
defensive
character
the
state
of
the
is
a
symptom
or
of
the
state
of
the
man
hence
when
he
is
ill
he
will
visit
and
examine
it
or
if
he
can
not
go
himself
he
will
send
another
to
inspect
it
and
report
in
either
case
the
man
turns
the
animal
if
animal
it
be
carefully
over
in
order
to
see
what
is
the
matter
with
it
should
something
be
found
sticking
to
its
skin
it
is
removed
and
through
the
relief
thus
afforded
to
the
creature
the
sick
man
recovers
but
if
the
animal
should
be
found
dying
it
is
an
omen
of
death
for
the
man
for
whenever
it
dies
he
dies
also
in
melanesia
a
native
doctor
was
once
attending
to
a
sick
man
just
then
a
large
came
soaring
past
the
house
and
kaplen
my
hunter
was
going
to
shoot
it
but
the
doctor
jumped
up
in
evident
alarm
and
said
oh
don
t
shoot
that
is
my
spirit
literally
my
shadow
if
you
shoot
that
i
will
he
then
told
the
old
man
if
you
see
a
rat
don
t
drive
it
away
tis
my
spirit
or
a
snake
which
will
come
that
also
is
my
it
does
not
appear
whether
the
doctor
in
this
case
like
the
giant
or
warlock
in
the
tales
kept
his
spirit
permanently
in
the
bird
or
in
the
animal
or
whether
he
only
transferred
it
temporarily
to
the
creature
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
him
the
better
to
work
the
cure
perhaps
by
sending
out
his
own
soul
in
a
bird
or
beast
to
find
and
bring
back
the
lost
soul
of
the
patient
in
either
case
he
seems
to
have
thought
like
the
giant
or
warlock
in
the
stories
that
the
death
of
the
bird
or
the
animal
would
simultaneously
entail
his
own
a
family
in
nauru
one
of
the
marshall
islands
apparently
imagine
that
their
lives
are
bound
up
with
a
species
of
large
fish
which
has
a
huge
mouth
and
devours
human
beings
for
when
one
of
these
fish
was
killed
the
members
of
the
family
cried
our
guardian
spirit
is
killed
now
we
must
all
die
the
theory
of
an
external
soul
deposited
in
an
animal
appears
to
be
very
prevalent
in
west
africa
particularly
in
nigeria
the
cameroons
and
the
gaboon
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
two
english
missionaries
established
at
san
salvador
the
capital
of
the
king
of
congo
asked
the
natives
repeatedly
whether
any
of
them
had
seen
the
strange
big
east
african
goat
which
stanley
had
given
to
a
chief
at
stanley
pool
in
but
their
enquiries
were
fruitless
no
native
would
admit
that
he
had
seen
the
goat
some
years
afterwards
the
missionaries
discovered
why
they
could
obtain
no
reply
to
their
enquiry
all
the
people
it
turned
out
imagined
that
the
missionaries
believed
the
spirit
of
the
king
of
salvador
to
be
contained
in
the
goat
and
that
they
wished
to
obtain
possession
of
the
animal
in
order
to
exercise
an
evil
influence
on
his
majesty
the
belief
from
the
standpoint
of
the
congo
savages
was
natural
enough
since
in
that
region
some
chiefs
regularly
link
their
fate
to
that
of
an
animal
thus
the
chief
bankwa
of
ndolo
on
the
moeko
river
had
conferred
this
honour
on
a
certain
hippopotamus
of
the
neighbourhood
at
which
he
would
allow
nobody
to
shoot
at
the
village
of
ongek
in
the
gaboon
a
french
missionary
slept
in
the
hut
of
an
old
fan
chief
awakened
about
two
in
the
morning
by
a
rustling
of
dry
leaves
he
lit
a
torch
when
to
his
horror
he
perceived
a
huge
black
serpent
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
coiled
in
a
corner
with
head
erect
shining
eyes
and
hissing
jaws
ready
to
dart
at
him
instinctively
he
seized
his
gun
and
pointed
it
at
the
reptile
when
suddenly
his
arm
was
struck
up
the
torch
was
extinguished
and
the
voice
of
the
old
chief
said
don
t
fire
don
t
fire
i
beg
of
you
in
killing
the
serpent
it
is
me
that
you
would
kill
fear
nothing
the
serpent
is
my
so
saying
he
flung
himself
on
his
knees
beside
the
reptile
put
his
arms
about
it
and
clasped
it
to
his
breast
the
serpent
received
his
caresses
quietly
manifesting
neither
anger
nor
fear
and
the
chief
carried
it
off
and
laid
it
down
beside
him
in
another
hut
exhorting
the
missionary
to
have
no
fear
and
never
to
speak
of
the
subject
his
curiosity
being
excited
by
this
adventure
the
missionary
father
trilles
pursued
his
enquiries
and
ascertained
that
among
the
fans
of
the
gaboon
every
wizard
is
believed
at
initiation
to
unite
his
life
with
that
of
some
particular
wild
animal
by
a
rite
of
he
draws
blood
from
the
ear
of
the
animal
and
from
his
own
arm
and
inoculates
the
animal
with
his
own
blood
and
himself
with
the
blood
of
the
beast
henceforth
such
an
intimate
union
is
established
between
the
two
that
the
death
of
the
one
entails
the
death
of
the
other
the
alliance
is
thought
to
bring
to
the
wizard
or
sorcerer
a
great
accession
of
power
which
he
can
turn
to
his
advantage
in
various
ways
in
the
first
place
like
the
warlock
in
the
fairy
tales
who
has
deposited
his
life
outside
of
himself
in
some
safe
place
the
fan
wizard
now
deems
himself
invulnerable
moreover
the
animal
with
which
he
has
exchanged
blood
has
become
his
familiar
and
will
obey
any
orders
he
may
choose
to
give
it
so
he
makes
use
of
it
to
injure
and
kill
his
enemies
for
that
reason
the
creature
with
whom
he
establishes
the
relation
of
is
never
a
tame
or
domestic
animal
but
always
a
ferocious
and
dangerous
wild
beast
such
as
a
leopard
a
black
serpent
a
crocodile
a
hippopotamus
a
wild
boar
or
a
vulture
of
all
these
creatures
the
leopard
is
by
far
the
commonest
familiar
of
fan
wizards
and
next
to
it
comes
the
black
serpent
the
vulture
is
the
rarest
witches
as
well
as
wizards
have
their
familiars
but
the
animals
with
which
the
lives
of
women
are
thus
bound
up
generally
differ
from
those
to
which
men
commit
their
external
souls
a
witch
never
has
a
panther
for
her
familiar
but
often
a
venomous
species
of
serpent
sometimes
a
horned
viper
sometimes
a
black
serpent
sometimes
a
green
one
that
lives
in
or
it
may
be
a
vulture
an
owl
or
other
bird
of
night
in
every
case
the
beast
or
bird
with
which
the
witch
or
wizard
has
contracted
this
mystic
alliance
is
an
individual
never
a
species
and
when
the
individual
animal
dies
the
alliance
is
naturally
at
an
end
since
the
death
of
the
animal
is
supposed
to
entail
the
death
of
the
man
similar
beliefs
are
held
by
the
natives
of
the
cross
river
valley
within
the
german
provinces
of
the
cameroons
groups
of
people
generally
the
inhabitants
of
a
village
have
chosen
various
animals
with
which
they
believe
themselves
to
stand
on
a
footing
of
intimate
friendship
or
relationship
amongst
such
animals
are
hippopotamuses
elephants
leopards
crocodiles
gorillas
fish
and
serpents
all
of
them
creatures
which
are
either
very
strong
or
can
easily
hide
themselves
in
the
water
or
a
thicket
this
power
of
concealing
themselves
is
said
to
be
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
choice
of
animal
familiars
since
the
animal
friend
or
helper
is
expected
to
injure
his
owner
s
enemy
by
stealth
for
example
if
he
is
a
hippopotamus
he
will
bob
up
suddenly
out
of
the
water
and
capsize
the
enemy
s
canoe
between
the
animals
and
their
human
friends
or
kinsfolk
such
a
sympathetic
relation
is
supposed
to
exist
that
the
moment
the
animal
dies
the
man
dies
also
and
similarly
the
instant
the
man
perishes
so
does
the
beast
from
this
it
follows
that
the
animal
kinsfolk
may
never
be
shot
at
or
molested
for
fear
of
injuring
or
killing
the
persons
whose
lives
are
knit
up
with
the
lives
of
the
brutes
this
does
not
however
prevent
the
people
of
a
village
who
have
elephants
for
their
animal
friends
from
hunting
elephants
for
they
do
not
respect
the
whole
species
but
merely
certain
individuals
of
it
which
stand
in
an
intimate
relation
to
certain
individual
men
and
women
and
they
imagine
that
they
can
always
distinguish
these
brother
elephants
from
the
common
herd
of
elephants
which
are
mere
elephants
and
nothing
more
the
recognition
indeed
is
said
to
be
mutual
when
a
hunter
who
has
an
elephant
for
his
friend
meets
a
human
elephant
as
we
may
call
it
the
noble
animal
lifts
up
a
paw
and
holds
it
before
his
face
as
much
as
to
say
don
t
were
the
hunter
so
inhuman
as
to
fire
on
and
wound
such
an
elephant
the
person
whose
life
was
bound
up
with
the
elephant
would
fall
the
balong
of
the
cameroons
think
that
every
man
has
several
souls
of
which
one
is
in
his
body
and
another
in
an
animal
such
as
an
elephant
a
wild
pig
a
leopard
and
so
forth
when
a
man
comes
home
feeling
ill
and
says
i
shall
soon
die
and
dies
accordingly
the
people
aver
that
one
of
his
souls
has
been
killed
in
a
wild
pig
or
a
leopard
and
that
the
death
of
the
external
soul
has
caused
the
death
of
the
soul
in
his
body
hence
the
corpse
is
cut
open
and
a
diviner
determines
from
an
inspection
of
the
inwards
whether
the
popular
surmise
is
correct
or
not
a
similar
belief
in
the
external
souls
of
living
people
is
entertained
by
the
ibos
an
important
tribe
of
the
niger
delta
who
inhabit
a
country
west
of
the
cross
river
they
think
that
a
man
s
spirit
can
quit
his
body
for
a
time
during
life
and
take
up
its
abode
in
an
animal
this
is
called
to
turn
a
man
who
wishes
to
acquire
this
power
procures
a
certain
drug
from
a
wise
man
and
mixes
it
with
his
food
after
that
his
soul
goes
out
and
enters
into
the
animal
if
it
should
happen
that
the
animal
is
killed
while
the
man
s
soul
is
lodged
in
it
the
man
dies
and
if
the
animal
be
wounded
the
man
s
body
will
presently
be
covered
with
boils
this
belief
instigates
to
many
deeds
of
darkness
for
a
sly
rogue
will
sometimes
surreptitiously
administer
the
magical
drug
to
his
enemy
in
his
food
and
having
thus
smuggled
the
other
s
soul
into
an
animal
will
destroy
the
creature
and
with
it
the
man
whose
soul
is
lodged
in
it
a
like
belief
is
reported
to
prevail
among
the
tribes
of
the
obubura
hill
district
on
the
cross
river
in
southern
nigeria
once
when
partridge
s
wished
to
catch
fish
near
a
town
of
the
assiga
tribe
the
people
objected
saying
our
souls
live
in
those
fish
and
if
you
kill
them
we
shall
the
negroes
of
calabar
at
the
mouth
of
the
niger
believe
that
every
person
has
four
souls
one
of
which
always
lives
outside
of
his
or
her
body
in
the
form
of
a
wild
beast
in
the
forest
this
external
soul
or
bush
soul
as
miss
kingsley
calls
it
may
be
almost
any
animal
for
example
a
leopard
a
fish
or
a
tortoise
but
it
is
never
a
domestic
animal
and
never
a
plant
unless
he
is
gifted
with
second
sight
a
man
can
not
see
his
own
bush
soul
but
a
diviner
will
often
tell
him
what
sort
of
creature
his
bush
soul
is
and
after
that
the
man
will
be
careful
not
to
kill
any
animal
of
that
species
and
will
strongly
object
to
any
one
else
doing
so
a
man
and
his
sons
have
usually
the
same
sort
of
animals
for
their
bush
souls
and
so
with
a
mother
and
her
daughters
but
sometimes
all
the
children
of
a
family
take
after
the
bush
soul
of
their
father
for
example
if
his
external
soul
is
a
leopard
all
his
sons
and
daughters
will
have
leopards
for
their
external
souls
and
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
they
all
take
after
their
mother
for
instance
if
her
external
soul
is
a
tortoise
all
the
external
souls
of
her
sons
and
daughters
will
be
tortoises
too
so
intimately
bound
up
is
the
life
of
the
man
with
that
of
the
animal
which
he
regards
as
his
external
or
bush
soul
that
the
death
or
injury
of
the
animal
necessarily
entails
the
death
or
injury
of
the
man
and
conversely
when
the
man
dies
his
bush
soul
can
no
longer
find
a
place
of
rest
but
goes
mad
and
rushes
into
the
fire
or
charges
people
and
is
knocked
on
the
head
and
that
is
an
end
of
it
when
a
person
is
sick
the
diviner
will
sometimes
tell
him
that
his
bush
soul
is
angry
at
being
neglected
thereupon
the
patient
will
make
an
offering
to
the
offended
spirit
and
deposit
it
in
a
tiny
hut
in
the
forest
at
the
spot
where
the
animal
which
is
his
external
soul
was
last
seen
if
the
bush
soul
is
appeased
the
patient
recovers
but
if
it
is
not
he
dies
yet
the
foolish
bush
soul
does
not
understand
that
in
injuring
the
man
it
injures
itself
and
that
it
can
not
long
survive
his
decease
such
is
the
account
which
miss
kingsley
gives
of
the
bush
souls
of
the
calabar
negroes
some
fresh
particulars
are
furnished
by
richard
henshaw
agent
for
native
affairs
at
calabar
he
tells
us
that
a
man
may
only
marry
a
woman
who
has
the
same
sort
of
bush
soul
as
himself
for
example
if
his
bush
soul
is
a
leopard
his
wife
also
must
have
a
leopard
for
her
bush
soul
further
we
learn
from
henshaw
that
a
person
s
bush
soul
need
not
be
that
either
of
his
father
or
of
his
mother
for
example
a
child
with
a
hippopotamus
for
his
bush
soul
may
be
born
into
a
family
all
the
members
of
which
have
wild
pigs
for
their
bush
souls
this
happens
when
the
child
is
a
reincarnation
of
a
man
whose
external
soul
was
a
hippopotamus
in
such
a
case
if
the
parents
object
to
the
intrusion
of
an
alien
soul
they
may
call
in
a
to
check
its
growth
and
finally
abolish
it
altogether
after
which
they
will
give
the
child
their
own
bush
soul
or
they
may
leave
the
matter
over
till
the
child
comes
of
age
when
he
will
choose
a
bush
soul
for
himself
with
the
help
of
a
who
will
also
select
the
piece
of
bush
or
water
in
which
the
chosen
animal
lives
when
a
man
dies
then
the
animal
which
contains
his
external
soul
becomes
insensible
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
approach
of
danger
thus
a
hunter
can
capture
or
kill
him
with
perfect
sacrifices
are
often
offered
to
prevent
other
people
from
killing
the
animal
in
which
a
man
s
bush
soul
resides
the
tribes
of
calabar
which
hold
these
beliefs
as
to
the
bush
soul
are
the
efik
and
ekoi
the
belief
of
the
calabar
negroes
in
the
external
soul
has
been
described
as
follows
by
a
missionary
is
the
native
word
we
have
taken
to
translate
our
word
it
primarily
signifies
the
shadow
of
a
person
it
also
signifies
that
which
dwells
within
a
man
on
which
his
life
depends
but
which
may
detach
itself
from
the
body
and
visiting
places
and
persons
here
and
there
again
return
to
its
abode
in
the
man
besides
all
this
the
word
is
used
to
designate
an
animal
possessed
of
an
so
connected
with
a
person
s
that
they
mutually
act
upon
each
other
when
the
leopard
or
crocodile
or
whatever
animal
may
be
a
man
s
gets
sick
or
dies
the
like
thing
happens
to
him
many
individuals
it
is
believed
have
the
power
of
changing
themselves
into
the
animals
which
are
their
among
the
ekoi
of
the
oban
district
in
southern
nigeria
it
is
usual
to
hear
a
person
say
of
another
that
he
or
she
possesses
such
and
such
an
animal
meaning
that
the
person
has
the
power
to
assume
the
shape
of
that
particular
creature
it
is
their
belief
that
by
constant
practice
and
by
virtue
of
certain
hereditary
secrets
a
man
can
quit
his
human
body
and
put
on
that
of
a
wild
beast
they
say
that
in
addition
to
the
soul
which
animates
his
human
body
everybody
has
a
bush
soul
which
at
times
he
can
send
forth
to
animate
the
body
of
the
creature
which
he
when
he
wishes
his
bush
soul
to
go
out
on
its
rambles
he
drinks
a
magic
potion
the
secret
of
which
has
been
handed
down
from
time
immemorial
and
some
of
which
is
always
kept
ready
for
use
in
an
ancient
earthen
pot
set
apart
for
the
purpose
no
sooner
has
he
drunk
the
mystic
draught
than
his
bush
soul
escapes
from
him
and
floats
away
invisible
through
the
town
into
the
forest
there
it
begins
to
swell
and
safe
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
takes
on
the
shape
of
the
man
s
animal
double
it
may
be
an
elephant
a
leopard
a
buffalo
a
wild
boar
or
a
crocodile
naturally
the
potion
differs
according
to
the
kind
of
animal
into
which
a
man
is
temporarily
converted
it
would
be
absurd
for
example
to
expect
that
the
dose
which
turns
you
into
an
elephant
should
also
be
able
to
turn
you
into
a
crocodile
the
thing
is
manifestly
impossible
a
great
advantage
of
these
temporary
conversions
of
a
man
into
a
beast
is
that
it
enables
the
convert
in
his
animal
shape
to
pay
out
his
enemy
without
being
suspected
if
for
example
you
have
a
grudge
at
a
man
who
is
a
farmer
all
that
you
have
to
do
is
to
turn
yourself
by
night
into
a
buffalo
an
elephant
or
a
wild
boar
and
then
bursting
into
his
fields
stamp
about
in
them
till
you
have
laid
the
standing
crops
level
with
the
ground
that
is
why
in
the
neighbourhood
of
large
farms
people
prefer
to
keep
their
bush
souls
in
buffaloes
elephants
and
wild
boars
because
these
animals
are
the
most
convenient
means
of
destroying
a
neighbour
s
crops
whereas
where
the
farms
are
small
and
as
they
are
round
about
oban
it
is
hardly
worth
a
man
s
while
to
take
the
trouble
of
turning
into
a
buffalo
or
an
elephant
for
the
paltry
satisfaction
of
rooting
up
a
few
miserable
yams
or
such
like
trash
so
the
oban
people
keep
their
bush
souls
in
leopards
and
crocodiles
which
though
of
little
use
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
neighbour
s
crops
are
excellent
for
the
purpose
of
killing
the
man
himself
first
and
eating
him
afterwards
but
the
power
of
turning
into
an
animal
has
this
serious
disadvantage
that
it
lays
you
open
to
the
chance
of
being
wounded
or
even
slain
in
your
animal
skin
before
you
have
time
to
put
it
off
and
scramble
back
into
your
human
integument
a
remarkable
case
of
this
sort
happened
only
a
few
miles
from
oban
not
long
ago
to
understand
it
you
must
know
that
the
chiefs
of
the
ododop
tribe
who
live
about
ten
miles
from
oban
keep
their
bush
souls
whenever
they
are
out
on
a
ramble
in
the
shape
of
buffaloes
well
one
day
the
district
commissioner
at
oban
saw
a
buffalo
come
down
to
drink
at
a
stream
which
runs
through
his
garden
he
shot
at
the
beast
and
hit
it
and
it
ran
away
badly
wounded
at
the
very
same
moment
the
head
chief
of
the
ododop
tribe
ten
miles
away
clapped
his
hand
to
his
side
and
said
they
have
killed
me
at
death
was
not
instantaneous
for
the
buffalo
lingered
in
pain
for
a
couple
of
days
in
the
forest
but
an
hour
or
two
before
its
dead
body
was
discovered
by
the
trackers
the
chief
expired
just
before
he
died
with
touching
solicitude
he
sent
a
message
warning
all
people
who
kept
their
external
souls
in
buffaloes
to
profit
by
his
sad
fate
and
beware
of
going
near
oban
which
was
not
a
safe
place
for
them
naturally
when
a
man
keeps
his
external
soul
from
time
to
time
in
a
beast
say
in
a
wild
cow
he
is
not
so
foolish
as
to
shoot
an
animal
of
that
particular
sort
for
in
so
doing
he
might
perhaps
be
killing
himself
but
he
may
kill
animals
in
which
other
people
keep
their
external
souls
for
example
a
wild
cow
man
may
freely
shoot
an
antelope
or
a
wild
boar
but
should
he
do
so
and
then
have
reason
to
suspect
that
the
dead
beast
is
the
animal
double
of
somebody
with
whom
he
is
on
friendly
terms
he
must
perform
certain
ceremonies
over
the
carcase
and
then
hurry
home
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
to
administer
a
particular
medicine
to
the
man
whom
he
has
unintentionally
injured
in
this
way
he
may
possibly
be
in
time
to
save
the
life
of
his
friend
from
the
effects
of
the
deplorable
accident
near
eket
in
north
calabar
there
is
a
sacred
lake
the
fish
of
which
are
carefully
preserved
because
the
people
believe
that
their
own
souls
are
lodged
in
the
fish
and
that
with
every
fish
killed
a
human
life
would
be
simultaneously
extinguished
in
the
calabar
river
not
very
many
years
ago
there
used
to
be
a
huge
old
crocodile
popularly
supposed
to
contain
the
external
soul
of
a
chief
who
resided
in
the
flesh
at
duke
town
sporting
used
from
time
to
time
to
hunt
the
animal
and
once
a
peculiarly
energetic
officer
contrived
to
hit
it
forthwith
the
chief
was
laid
up
with
a
wound
in
his
leg
he
gave
out
that
a
dog
had
bitten
him
but
no
doubt
the
wise
shook
their
heads
and
refused
to
be
put
off
with
so
flimsy
a
pretext
again
among
several
tribes
on
the
banks
of
the
niger
between
lokoja
and
the
delta
there
prevails
a
belief
in
the
possibility
of
a
man
possessing
an
in
the
form
of
some
animal
such
as
a
crocodile
or
a
hippopotamus
it
is
believed
that
such
a
person
s
life
is
bound
up
with
that
of
the
animal
to
such
an
extent
that
whatever
affects
the
one
produces
a
corresponding
impression
upon
the
other
and
that
if
one
dies
the
other
must
speedily
do
so
too
it
happened
not
very
long
ago
that
an
englishman
shot
a
hippopotamus
close
to
a
native
village
the
friends
of
a
woman
who
died
the
same
night
in
the
village
demanded
and
eventually
obtained
five
pounds
as
compensation
for
the
murder
of
the
among
the
montols
of
northern
nigeria
in
many
of
the
compounds
there
will
be
found
a
species
of
snake
of
a
sort
which
when
full
grown
attains
a
length
of
about
five
feet
and
a
girth
of
eight
or
nine
inches
these
snakes
live
in
and
about
the
compound
they
are
not
specially
fed
by
the
people
of
the
place
nor
are
places
provided
for
them
to
nest
in
they
live
generally
in
the
roofs
of
the
small
granaries
and
huts
that
make
up
the
compound
they
feed
upon
small
mammals
and
no
doubt
serve
a
useful
purpose
in
destroying
vermin
which
might
otherwise
eat
the
stored
grain
they
are
not
kept
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
vermin
however
the
montols
believe
that
at
the
birth
of
every
individual
of
their
race
male
and
female
one
of
these
snakes
of
the
same
sex
is
also
born
if
the
snake
be
killed
his
human
partner
in
life
dies
also
and
at
the
same
time
if
the
wife
of
a
gives
birth
to
a
son
shortly
after
the
interesting
event
the
snake
of
the
establishment
will
be
seen
with
a
young
one
of
corresponding
sex
from
the
moment
of
birth
these
two
the
snake
and
the
man
share
a
life
of
common
duration
and
the
measure
of
the
one
is
the
measure
of
the
other
hence
every
care
is
taken
to
protect
these
animals
from
injury
and
no
montol
would
in
any
circumstances
think
of
injuring
or
killing
one
it
is
said
that
a
snake
of
this
kind
never
attempts
any
injury
to
a
man
there
is
only
one
type
of
snake
thus
among
the
angass
of
the
kanna
district
in
northern
nigeria
when
a
man
is
born
he
is
endowed
with
two
distinct
entities
life
and
a
arabic
when
the
enters
a
man
its
counterpart
enters
some
beast
or
snake
at
the
same
time
and
if
either
dies
so
also
does
the
body
containing
the
counterpart
this
however
in
no
wise
prevents
a
man
from
killing
any
game
he
may
see
though
he
knows
full
well
that
he
is
causing
thereby
the
death
of
some
man
or
woman
when
a
man
dies
his
life
and
both
leave
him
though
the
latter
is
asserted
sometimes
to
linger
near
the
place
of
death
for
a
day
or
again
at
the
town
of
paha
in
the
northern
territory
of
the
gold
coast
there
are
pools
inhabited
by
crocodiles
which
are
worshipped
by
the
people
the
natives
believe
that
for
every
death
or
birth
in
the
town
a
similar
event
takes
place
among
the
crocodiles
in
south
africa
the
conception
of
an
external
soul
deposited
in
an
animal
which
is
so
common
in
west
africa
appears
to
be
almost
unknown
at
least
i
have
met
with
no
clear
traces
of
it
in
literature
the
bechuanas
indeed
commonly
believe
that
if
a
man
wounds
a
crocodile
the
man
will
be
ill
as
long
as
the
crocodile
is
ill
of
its
wound
and
that
if
the
crocodile
dies
the
man
dies
too
this
belief
is
not
apparently
confined
to
the
bechuana
clan
which
has
the
crocodile
for
its
totem
but
is
shared
by
all
the
other
clans
all
of
them
certainly
hold
the
crocodile
in
respect
it
does
not
appear
whether
the
sympathetic
relation
between
a
man
and
a
crocodile
is
supposed
by
the
bechuanas
to
be
lifelong
or
only
to
arise
at
the
moment
when
the
man
wounds
the
animal
in
the
latter
case
the
shedding
of
the
crocodile
s
blood
might
perhaps
be
thought
to
establish
a
relationship
of
affinity
or
sympathy
between
the
two
the
zulus
believe
that
every
man
is
attended
by
an
ancestral
spirit
or
rather
in
the
form
of
a
serpent
which
specially
guards
and
helps
him
lives
with
him
wakes
with
him
sleeps
and
travels
with
him
but
always
under
ground
if
it
ever
makes
its
appearance
great
is
the
joy
and
the
man
must
seek
to
discover
the
meaning
of
its
appearance
he
who
has
no
must
die
therefore
if
any
one
kills
an
serpent
the
man
whose
it
was
dies
but
the
serpent
comes
to
life
but
the
conception
of
a
dead
ancestor
incarnate
in
a
snake
on
which
the
welfare
or
existence
of
one
of
his
living
descendants
depends
is
rather
that
of
a
guardian
spirit
than
of
an
external
soul
amongst
the
zapotecs
of
central
america
when
a
woman
was
about
to
be
confined
her
relations
assembled
in
the
hut
and
began
to
draw
on
the
floor
figures
of
different
animals
rubbing
each
one
out
as
soon
as
it
was
completed
this
went
on
till
the
moment
of
birth
and
the
figure
that
then
remained
sketched
upon
the
ground
was
called
the
child
s
or
second
self
when
the
child
grew
old
enough
he
procured
the
animal
that
represented
him
and
took
care
of
it
as
it
was
believed
that
health
and
existence
were
bound
up
with
that
of
the
animal
s
in
fact
that
the
death
of
both
would
occur
simultaneously
or
rather
that
when
the
animal
died
the
man
would
die
too
among
the
indians
of
guatemala
and
honduras
the
or
is
that
animate
or
inanimate
object
generally
an
animal
which
stands
in
a
parallel
relation
to
a
particular
man
so
that
the
weal
and
woe
of
the
man
depend
on
the
fate
of
the
according
to
an
old
writer
many
indians
of
guatemala
are
deluded
by
the
devil
to
believe
that
their
life
dependeth
upon
the
life
of
such
and
such
a
beast
which
they
take
unto
them
as
their
familiar
spirit
and
think
that
when
that
beast
dieth
they
must
die
when
he
is
chased
their
hearts
pant
when
he
is
faint
they
are
faint
nay
it
happeneth
that
by
the
devil
s
delusion
they
appear
in
the
shape
of
that
beast
which
commonly
by
their
choice
is
a
buck
or
doe
a
lion
or
tigre
or
dog
or
eagle
and
in
that
shape
have
been
shot
at
and
herrera
s
account
of
the
way
in
which
the
indians
of
honduras
acquired
their
runs
thus
the
devil
deluded
them
appearing
in
the
shape
of
a
lion
or
a
tiger
or
a
coyte
a
beast
like
a
wolf
or
in
the
shape
of
an
alligator
a
snake
or
a
bird
that
province
abounding
in
creatures
of
prey
which
they
called
signifying
keepers
or
guardians
and
when
the
bird
died
the
indian
that
was
in
league
with
him
died
also
which
often
happened
and
was
looked
upon
as
infallible
the
manner
of
contracting
this
alliance
was
thus
the
indian
repaired
to
the
river
wood
hill
or
most
obscure
place
where
he
called
upon
the
devils
by
such
names
as
he
thought
fit
talked
to
the
rivers
rocks
or
woods
said
he
went
to
weep
that
he
might
have
the
same
his
predecessors
had
carrying
a
cock
or
a
dog
to
sacrifice
in
that
melancholy
fit
he
fell
asleep
and
either
in
a
dream
or
waking
saw
some
one
of
the
aforesaid
birds
or
other
creatures
whom
he
entreated
to
grant
him
profit
in
salt
cacao
or
any
other
commodity
drawing
blood
from
his
own
tongue
ears
and
other
parts
of
his
body
making
his
contract
at
the
same
time
with
the
said
creature
the
which
either
in
a
dream
or
waking
told
him
such
a
day
you
shall
go
abroad
asporting
and
i
will
be
the
first
bird
or
other
animal
you
shall
meet
and
will
be
your
and
companion
at
all
whereupon
such
friendship
was
contracted
between
them
that
when
one
of
them
died
the
other
did
not
survive
and
they
fancied
that
he
who
had
no
could
not
be
the
indians
were
persuaded
that
the
death
of
their
would
entail
their
own
legend
affirms
that
in
the
first
battles
with
the
spaniards
on
the
plateau
of
quetzaltenango
the
of
the
indian
chiefs
fought
in
the
form
of
serpents
the
of
the
highest
chief
was
especially
conspicuous
because
it
had
the
form
of
a
great
bird
resplendent
in
green
plumage
the
spanish
general
pedro
de
alvarado
killed
the
bird
with
his
lance
and
at
the
same
moment
the
indian
chief
fell
dead
to
the
ground
in
many
tribes
of
australia
each
sex
used
to
regard
a
particular
species
of
animals
in
the
same
way
that
a
central
american
indian
regarded
his
but
with
this
difference
that
whereas
the
indian
apparently
knew
the
individual
animal
with
which
his
life
was
bound
up
the
australians
only
knew
that
each
of
their
lives
was
bound
up
with
some
one
animal
of
the
species
but
they
could
not
say
with
which
the
result
naturally
was
that
every
man
spared
and
protected
all
the
animals
of
the
species
with
which
the
lives
of
the
men
were
bound
up
and
every
woman
spared
and
protected
all
the
animals
of
the
species
with
which
the
lives
of
the
women
were
bound
up
because
no
one
knew
but
that
the
death
of
any
animal
of
the
respective
species
might
entail
his
or
her
own
just
as
the
killing
of
the
green
bird
was
immediately
followed
by
the
death
of
the
indian
chief
and
the
killing
of
the
parrot
by
the
death
of
punchkin
in
the
fairy
tale
thus
for
example
the
wotjobaluk
tribe
of
australia
held
that
the
life
of
ngŭnŭngŭnŭt
the
bat
is
the
life
of
a
man
and
the
life
of
yártatgŭrk
the
nightjar
is
the
life
of
a
woman
and
that
when
either
of
these
creatures
is
killed
the
life
of
some
man
or
of
some
woman
is
shortened
in
such
a
case
every
man
or
every
woman
in
the
camp
feared
that
he
or
she
might
be
the
victim
and
from
this
cause
great
fights
arose
in
this
tribe
i
learn
that
in
these
fights
men
on
one
side
and
women
on
the
other
it
was
not
at
all
certain
which
would
be
victorious
for
at
times
the
women
gave
the
men
a
severe
drubbing
with
their
yamsticks
while
often
women
were
injured
or
killed
by
the
wotjobaluk
said
that
the
bat
was
the
man
s
brother
and
that
the
nightjar
was
his
the
particular
species
of
animals
with
which
the
lives
of
the
sexes
were
believed
to
be
respectively
bound
up
varied
somewhat
from
tribe
to
tribe
thus
whereas
among
the
wotjobaluk
the
bat
was
the
animal
of
the
men
at
gunbower
creek
on
the
lower
murray
the
bat
seems
to
have
been
the
animal
of
the
women
for
the
natives
would
not
kill
it
for
the
reason
that
if
it
was
killed
one
of
their
lubras
women
would
be
sure
to
die
in
in
the
kurnai
tribe
of
gippsland
the
was
the
man
s
brother
and
the
superb
warbler
was
the
woman
s
sister
at
the
initiation
of
young
men
into
the
tribal
mysteries
the
name
of
the
was
invoked
over
the
novices
for
the
purpose
of
infusing
manly
virtue
into
them
among
the
yuin
on
the
coast
of
australia
the
woman
s
sister
was
the
and
the
men
had
both
the
bat
and
the
for
their
in
the
kulin
nation
each
sex
had
a
pair
of
brothers
and
sisters
the
men
had
the
bat
and
the
for
their
brothers
and
the
women
had
the
superb
warbler
and
the
small
nightjar
for
their
it
is
notable
that
in
australia
the
animals
thus
associated
with
the
lives
of
men
and
women
were
generally
flying
creatures
either
birds
or
bats
however
in
the
port
lincoln
tribe
of
south
australia
the
man
s
brother
and
the
woman
s
sister
seem
to
have
been
identified
with
the
male
and
female
respectively
of
a
species
of
lizard
for
we
read
that
a
small
kind
of
lizard
the
male
of
which
is
called
and
the
female
is
said
to
have
divided
the
sexes
in
the
human
species
an
event
that
would
appear
not
to
be
much
approved
of
by
the
natives
since
either
sex
has
a
mortal
hatred
against
the
opposite
sex
of
these
little
animals
the
men
always
destroying
the
and
the
women
the
but
whatever
the
particular
sorts
of
creature
with
which
the
lives
of
men
and
women
were
believed
to
be
bound
up
the
belief
itself
and
the
fights
to
which
it
gave
rise
are
known
to
have
prevailed
over
a
large
part
of
australia
and
probably
they
extended
much
farther
the
belief
was
a
very
serious
one
and
so
consequently
were
the
fights
which
sprang
from
it
thus
among
some
tribes
of
victoria
the
common
bat
belongs
to
the
men
who
protect
it
against
injury
even
to
the
of
their
wives
for
its
sake
the
fern
owl
or
large
goatsucker
belongs
to
the
women
and
although
a
bird
of
evil
omen
creating
terror
at
night
by
its
cry
it
is
jealously
protected
by
them
if
a
man
kills
one
they
are
as
much
enraged
as
if
it
was
one
of
their
children
and
will
strike
him
with
their
long
the
jealous
protection
thus
afforded
by
australian
men
and
women
to
bats
and
owls
respectively
for
bats
and
owls
seem
to
be
the
creatures
usually
allotted
to
the
two
sexes
is
not
based
upon
purely
selfish
considerations
for
each
man
believes
that
not
only
his
own
life
but
the
lives
of
his
father
brothers
sons
and
so
on
are
bound
up
with
the
lives
of
particular
bats
and
that
therefore
in
protecting
the
bat
species
he
is
protecting
the
lives
of
all
his
male
relations
as
well
as
his
own
similarly
each
woman
believes
that
the
lives
of
her
mother
sisters
daughters
and
so
forth
equally
with
her
own
are
bound
up
with
the
lives
of
particular
owls
and
that
in
guarding
the
owl
species
she
is
guarding
the
lives
of
all
her
female
relations
besides
her
own
now
when
men
s
lives
are
thus
supposed
to
be
contained
in
certain
animals
it
is
obvious
that
the
animals
can
hardly
be
distinguished
from
the
men
or
the
men
from
the
animals
if
my
brother
john
s
life
is
in
a
bat
then
on
the
one
hand
the
bat
is
my
brother
as
well
as
john
and
on
the
other
hand
john
is
in
a
sense
a
bat
since
his
life
is
in
a
bat
similarly
if
my
sister
mary
s
life
is
in
an
owl
then
the
owl
is
my
sister
and
mary
is
an
owl
this
is
a
natural
enough
conclusion
and
the
australians
have
not
failed
to
draw
it
when
the
bat
is
the
man
s
animal
it
is
called
his
brother
and
when
the
owl
is
the
woman
s
animal
it
is
called
her
sister
and
conversely
a
man
addresses
a
woman
as
an
owl
and
she
addresses
him
as
a
bat
so
with
the
other
animals
allotted
to
the
sexes
respectively
in
other
tribes
for
example
among
the
kurnai
all
were
brothers
of
the
men
and
all
the
men
were
all
superb
warblers
were
sisters
of
the
women
and
all
the
women
were
superb
warblers
a
suggested
theory
of
totemism
but
when
a
savage
names
himself
after
an
animal
calls
it
his
brother
and
refuses
to
kill
it
the
animal
is
said
to
be
his
totem
accordingly
in
the
tribes
of
australia
which
we
have
been
considering
the
bat
and
the
owl
the
and
the
superb
warbler
may
properly
be
described
as
totems
of
the
sexes
but
the
assignation
of
a
totem
to
a
sex
is
comparatively
rare
and
has
hitherto
been
discovered
nowhere
but
in
australia
far
more
commonly
the
totem
is
appropriated
not
to
a
sex
but
to
a
clan
and
is
hereditary
either
in
the
male
or
female
line
the
relation
of
an
individual
to
the
clan
totem
does
not
differ
in
kind
from
his
relation
to
the
sex
totem
he
will
not
kill
it
he
speaks
of
it
as
his
brother
and
he
calls
himself
by
its
name
now
if
the
relations
are
similar
the
explanation
which
holds
good
of
the
one
ought
equally
to
hold
good
of
the
other
therefore
the
reason
why
a
clan
revere
a
particular
species
of
animals
or
plants
for
the
clan
totem
may
be
a
plant
and
call
themselves
after
it
would
seem
to
be
a
belief
that
the
life
of
each
individual
of
the
clan
is
bound
up
with
some
one
animal
or
plant
of
the
species
and
that
his
or
her
death
would
be
the
consequence
of
killing
that
particular
animal
or
destroying
that
particular
plant
this
explanation
of
totemism
squares
very
well
with
sir
george
grey
s
definition
of
a
totem
or
in
western
australia
he
says
a
certain
mysterious
connection
exists
between
a
family
and
its
so
that
a
member
of
the
family
will
never
kill
an
animal
of
the
species
to
which
his
belongs
should
he
find
it
asleep
indeed
he
always
kills
it
reluctantly
and
never
without
affording
it
a
chance
to
escape
this
arises
from
the
family
belief
that
some
one
individual
of
the
species
is
their
nearest
friend
to
kill
whom
would
be
a
great
crime
and
to
be
carefully
avoided
similarly
a
native
who
has
a
vegetable
for
his
may
not
gather
it
under
certain
circumstances
and
at
a
particular
period
of
the
here
it
will
be
observed
that
though
each
man
spares
all
the
animals
or
plants
of
the
species
they
are
not
all
equally
precious
to
him
far
from
it
out
of
the
whole
species
there
is
only
one
which
is
specially
dear
to
him
but
as
he
does
not
know
which
the
dear
one
is
he
is
obliged
to
spare
them
all
from
fear
of
injuring
the
one
again
this
explanation
of
the
clan
totem
harmonizes
with
the
supposed
effect
of
killing
one
of
the
totem
species
one
day
one
of
the
blacks
killed
a
crow
three
or
four
days
afterwards
a
boortwa
crow
a
man
of
the
crow
clan
named
larry
died
he
had
been
ailing
for
some
days
but
the
killing
of
his
totem
hastened
his
here
the
killing
of
the
crow
caused
the
death
of
a
man
of
the
crow
clan
exactly
as
in
the
case
of
the
the
killing
of
a
bat
causes
the
death
of
a
or
the
killing
of
an
owl
causes
the
death
of
an
similarly
the
killing
of
his
causes
the
death
of
a
central
american
indian
the
killing
of
his
bush
soul
causes
the
death
of
a
calabar
negro
the
killing
of
his
causes
the
death
of
a
banks
islander
and
the
killing
of
the
animal
in
which
his
life
is
stowed
away
causes
the
death
of
the
giant
or
warlock
in
the
fairy
tale
thus
it
appears
that
the
story
of
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
in
his
body
may
perhaps
furnish
the
key
to
the
relation
which
is
supposed
to
subsist
between
a
man
and
his
totem
the
totem
on
this
theory
is
simply
the
receptacle
in
which
a
man
keeps
his
life
as
punchkin
kept
his
life
in
a
parrot
and
bidasari
kept
her
soul
in
a
golden
fish
it
is
no
valid
objection
to
this
view
that
when
a
savage
has
both
a
sex
totem
and
a
clan
totem
his
life
must
be
bound
up
with
two
different
animals
the
death
of
either
of
which
would
entail
his
own
if
a
man
has
more
vital
places
than
one
in
his
body
why
the
savage
may
think
should
he
not
have
more
vital
places
than
one
outside
it
why
since
he
can
put
his
life
outside
himself
should
he
not
transfer
one
portion
of
it
to
one
animal
and
another
to
another
the
divisibility
of
life
or
to
put
it
otherwise
the
plurality
of
souls
is
an
idea
suggested
by
many
familiar
facts
and
has
commended
itself
to
philosophers
like
plato
as
well
as
to
savages
it
finds
favour
also
with
the
sages
of
china
who
tell
us
that
every
human
being
is
provided
with
what
may
be
called
a
male
soul
and
a
female
soul
which
by
their
harmonious
compose
an
organic
unity
however
some
chinese
philosophers
will
have
it
that
each
of
the
five
viscera
has
its
own
separate
male
soul
and
a
taoist
treatise
written
about
the
end
of
the
tenth
or
beginning
of
the
eleventh
century
has
even
enriched
science
with
a
list
of
about
three
dozen
souls
distributed
over
the
various
parts
of
the
human
frame
indeed
not
content
with
a
bare
catalogue
of
these
souls
the
learned
author
has
annexed
to
the
name
and
surname
of
each
a
brief
description
of
its
size
and
stature
of
the
kind
of
dress
in
which
it
is
clothed
and
the
shape
of
hat
it
wears
it
is
only
when
the
notion
of
a
soul
from
being
a
hypothesis
becomes
a
theological
dogma
that
its
unity
and
indivisibility
are
insisted
upon
as
essential
the
savage
unshackled
by
dogma
is
free
to
explain
the
facts
of
life
by
the
assumption
of
as
many
souls
as
he
thinks
necessary
hence
for
example
the
caribs
supposed
that
there
was
one
soul
in
the
head
another
in
the
heart
and
other
souls
at
all
the
places
where
an
artery
is
felt
pulsating
some
of
the
hidatsa
indians
explain
the
phenomena
of
gradual
death
when
the
extremities
appear
dead
first
by
supposing
that
man
has
four
souls
and
that
they
quit
the
body
not
simultaneously
but
one
after
the
other
dissolution
being
only
complete
when
all
four
have
departed
some
of
the
dyaks
of
borneo
and
the
malays
of
the
peninsula
believe
that
every
man
has
seven
souls
the
alfoors
of
poso
in
celebes
are
of
opinion
that
he
has
three
the
natives
of
laos
suppose
that
the
body
is
the
seat
of
thirty
spirits
which
reside
in
the
hands
the
feet
the
mouth
the
eyes
and
so
on
hence
from
the
primitive
point
of
view
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
a
savage
should
have
one
soul
in
his
sex
totem
and
another
in
his
clan
totem
however
as
i
have
observed
sex
totems
have
been
found
nowhere
but
in
australia
so
that
as
a
rule
the
savage
who
practises
totemism
need
not
have
more
than
one
soul
out
of
his
body
at
a
time
if
this
explanation
of
the
totem
as
a
receptacle
in
which
a
man
keeps
his
soul
or
one
of
his
souls
is
correct
we
should
expect
to
find
some
totemic
people
of
whom
it
is
expressly
said
that
every
man
amongst
them
is
believed
to
keep
at
least
one
soul
permanently
out
of
his
body
and
that
the
destruction
of
this
external
soul
is
supposed
to
entail
the
death
of
its
owner
such
a
people
are
the
battas
of
sumatra
the
battas
are
divided
into
exogamous
clans
with
descent
in
the
male
line
and
each
clan
is
forbidden
to
eat
the
flesh
of
a
particular
animal
one
clan
may
not
eat
the
tiger
another
the
ape
another
the
crocodile
another
the
dog
another
the
cat
another
the
dove
another
the
white
buffalo
and
another
the
locust
the
reason
given
by
members
of
a
clan
for
abstaining
from
the
flesh
of
the
particular
animal
is
either
that
they
are
descended
from
animals
of
that
species
and
that
their
souls
after
death
may
transmigrate
into
the
animals
or
that
they
or
their
forefathers
have
been
under
certain
obligations
to
the
creatures
sometimes
but
not
always
the
clan
bears
the
name
of
the
animal
thus
the
battas
have
totemism
in
full
but
further
each
batta
believes
that
he
has
seven
or
on
a
more
moderate
computation
three
souls
one
of
these
souls
is
always
outside
the
body
but
nevertheless
whenever
it
dies
however
far
away
it
may
be
at
the
time
that
same
moment
the
man
dies
also
the
writer
who
mentions
this
belief
says
nothing
about
the
batta
totems
but
on
the
analogy
of
the
australian
central
american
and
african
evidence
we
may
conjecture
that
the
external
soul
whose
death
entails
the
death
of
the
man
is
housed
in
the
totemic
animal
or
plant
against
this
view
it
can
hardly
be
thought
to
militate
that
the
batta
does
not
in
set
terms
affirm
his
external
soul
to
be
in
his
totem
but
alleges
other
grounds
for
respecting
the
sacred
animal
or
plant
of
his
clan
for
if
a
savage
seriously
believes
that
his
life
is
bound
up
with
an
external
object
it
is
in
the
last
degree
unlikely
that
he
will
let
any
stranger
into
the
secret
in
all
that
touches
his
inmost
life
and
beliefs
the
savage
is
exceedingly
suspicious
and
reserved
europeans
have
resided
among
savages
for
years
without
discovering
some
of
their
capital
articles
of
faith
and
in
the
end
the
discovery
has
often
been
the
result
of
accident
above
all
the
savage
lives
in
an
intense
and
perpetual
dread
of
assassination
by
sorcery
the
most
trifling
relics
of
his
clippings
of
his
hair
and
nails
his
spittle
the
remnants
of
his
food
his
very
name
these
may
he
fancies
be
turned
by
the
sorcerer
to
his
destruction
and
he
is
therefore
anxiously
careful
to
conceal
or
destroy
them
but
if
in
matters
such
as
these
which
are
but
the
outposts
and
outworks
of
his
life
he
is
so
shy
and
secretive
how
close
must
be
the
concealment
how
impenetrable
the
reserve
in
which
he
enshrouds
the
inner
keep
and
citadel
of
his
being
when
the
princess
in
the
fairy
tale
asks
the
giant
where
he
keeps
his
soul
he
often
gives
false
or
evasive
answers
and
it
is
only
after
much
coaxing
and
wheedling
that
the
secret
is
at
last
wrung
from
him
in
his
jealous
reticence
the
giant
resembles
the
timid
and
furtive
savage
but
whereas
the
exigencies
of
the
story
demand
that
the
giant
should
at
last
reveal
his
secret
no
such
obligation
is
laid
on
the
savage
and
no
inducement
that
can
be
offered
is
likely
to
tempt
him
to
imperil
his
soul
by
revealing
its
to
a
stranger
it
is
therefore
no
matter
for
surprise
that
the
central
mystery
of
the
savage
s
life
should
so
long
have
remained
a
secret
and
that
we
should
be
left
to
piece
it
together
from
scattered
hints
and
fragments
and
from
the
recollections
of
it
which
linger
in
fairy
tales
the
ritual
of
death
and
resurrection
this
view
of
totemism
throws
light
on
a
class
of
religious
rites
of
which
no
adequate
explanation
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
yet
been
offered
amongst
many
savage
tribes
especially
such
as
are
known
to
practise
totemism
it
is
customary
for
lads
at
puberty
to
undergo
certain
initiatory
rites
of
which
one
of
the
commonest
is
a
pretence
of
killing
the
lad
and
bringing
him
to
life
again
such
rites
become
intelligible
if
we
suppose
that
their
substance
consists
in
extracting
the
youth
s
soul
in
order
to
transfer
it
to
his
totem
for
the
extraction
of
his
soul
would
naturally
be
supposed
to
kill
the
youth
or
at
least
to
throw
him
into
a
trance
which
the
savage
hardly
distinguishes
from
death
his
recovery
would
then
be
attributed
either
to
the
gradual
recovery
of
his
system
from
the
violent
shock
which
it
had
received
or
more
probably
to
the
infusion
into
him
of
fresh
life
drawn
from
the
totem
thus
the
essence
of
these
initiatory
rites
so
far
as
they
consist
in
a
simulation
of
death
and
resurrection
would
be
an
exchange
of
life
or
souls
between
the
man
and
his
totem
the
primitive
belief
in
the
possibility
of
such
an
exchange
of
souls
comes
clearly
out
in
the
story
of
the
basque
hunter
who
affirmed
that
he
had
been
killed
by
a
bear
but
that
the
bear
had
after
killing
him
breathed
its
own
soul
into
him
so
that
the
bear
s
body
was
now
dead
but
he
himself
was
a
bear
being
animated
by
the
bear
s
soul
this
revival
of
the
dead
hunter
as
a
bear
is
exactly
analogous
to
what
on
the
theory
here
suggested
is
supposed
to
take
place
in
the
ceremony
of
killing
a
lad
at
puberty
and
bringing
him
to
life
again
the
lad
dies
as
a
man
and
comes
to
life
again
as
an
animal
the
animal
s
soul
is
now
in
him
and
his
human
soul
is
in
the
animal
with
good
right
therefore
does
he
call
himself
a
bear
or
a
wolf
according
to
his
totem
and
with
good
right
does
he
treat
the
bears
or
the
wolves
as
his
brethren
since
in
these
animals
are
lodged
the
souls
of
himself
and
his
kindred
examples
of
this
supposed
death
and
resurrection
at
initiation
are
as
follows
in
the
wonghi
or
wonghibon
tribe
of
new
south
wales
the
youths
on
approaching
manhood
attend
a
meeting
of
the
tribe
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
are
secret
and
at
them
none
but
the
men
of
the
tribe
who
have
been
initiated
attend
with
the
novices
at
the
spot
where
the
ceremonies
are
to
be
performed
a
large
oval
space
is
cleared
the
old
men
of
the
tribe
conduct
the
ceremonies
and
the
medicine
man
of
the
tribe
is
the
master
of
them
part
of
the
proceedings
consists
in
knocking
out
a
tooth
and
giving
a
new
designation
to
the
novice
indicating
the
change
from
youth
to
manhood
when
the
tooth
is
knocked
out
a
loud
humming
noise
is
heard
which
is
made
with
an
instrument
of
the
following
description
a
flat
piece
of
wood
is
made
with
serrated
edges
and
having
a
hole
at
one
end
to
which
a
string
is
attached
and
this
swung
round
produces
a
humming
noise
the
uninitiated
are
not
even
allowed
to
see
this
instrument
women
are
forbidden
to
be
present
at
these
ceremonies
and
should
one
by
accident
or
otherwise
witness
them
the
penalty
is
death
the
penalty
for
revealing
the
secrets
is
probably
the
same
when
everything
is
prepared
the
women
and
children
are
covered
with
boughs
and
the
men
retire
with
the
young
fellows
who
are
to
be
initiated
to
a
little
distance
it
is
said
that
the
youths
are
sent
away
a
short
distance
one
by
one
and
that
they
are
each
met
in
turn
by
a
being
who
so
far
as
i
can
understand
is
believed
to
be
something
between
a
blackfellow
and
a
spirit
this
being
called
thuremlin
it
is
said
takes
the
youth
to
a
distance
kills
him
and
in
some
instances
cuts
him
up
after
which
he
restores
him
to
life
and
knocks
out
a
tooth
their
belief
in
the
power
of
thuremlin
is
the
foregoing
account
while
it
applies
strictly
to
one
tribe
only
may
be
regarded
as
typical
of
the
initiation
ceremonies
performed
on
young
men
throughout
the
tribes
of
and
central
australia
except
that
among
the
central
tribes
the
practice
of
knocking
out
a
tooth
on
these
occasions
is
replaced
by
the
equally
mysterious
and
much
severer
bodily
mutilations
of
circumcision
and
subincision
which
are
not
practised
by
the
tribes
of
the
the
instrument
whose
humming
or
booming
sound
accompanies
the
critical
operation
of
knocking
out
the
tooth
of
the
novice
is
the
now
which
figures
in
many
savage
rites
of
initiation
its
true
nature
is
concealed
from
the
women
and
uninitiated
lads
who
are
taught
to
believe
that
its
sonorous
and
notes
are
the
voice
of
the
mythical
being
often
called
daramulun
who
lives
in
the
sky
instituted
the
rites
and
superintends
their
performance
the
hollow
roar
of
the
slat
of
wood
as
it
is
swung
round
and
round
represents
the
muttering
of
thunder
and
the
thunder
is
the
voice
of
daramulun
and
therefore
its
sound
is
of
the
most
sacred
character
umbara
once
said
to
me
thunder
is
the
voice
of
him
pointing
upward
to
the
sky
calling
on
the
rain
to
fall
and
make
everything
grow
up
this
supposed
resemblance
of
the
sound
to
thunder
probably
explains
a
certain
use
which
the
dieri
a
tribe
of
central
australia
made
of
the
instrument
when
a
young
man
had
passed
through
an
initiatory
rite
which
consisted
in
cutting
a
row
of
gashes
in
his
back
he
was
given
a
and
when
he
went
out
in
search
of
game
he
used
to
twirl
the
implement
in
the
belief
that
by
doing
so
while
his
wounds
were
still
unhealed
he
created
a
good
harvest
of
snakes
lizards
and
other
reptiles
which
the
natives
employ
as
food
but
on
the
contrary
they
imagined
that
these
supplies
of
food
would
be
cut
off
for
ever
if
a
woman
were
to
see
a
which
had
been
swung
at
the
rites
of
initiation
no
doubt
these
savages
living
in
a
parched
wilderness
where
the
existence
of
plants
and
animals
depends
on
rare
and
irregular
showers
have
observed
that
the
fall
of
rain
is
regularly
followed
by
a
great
and
sudden
increase
in
the
food
supply
and
that
this
increase
is
most
marked
after
violent
hence
by
making
a
noise
like
thunder
with
the
help
of
they
probably
hope
on
the
principle
of
imitative
magic
to
bring
on
a
and
with
it
a
fertilizing
deluge
of
rain
for
the
same
reason
in
the
parched
and
torrid
regions
of
arizona
and
new
mexico
the
indians
make
great
use
of
the
in
their
ceremonies
for
procuring
rain
for
example
when
captain
bourke
was
at
the
pueblo
indian
village
of
walpi
in
the
month
of
august
he
saw
the
instrument
in
use
at
the
snake
dance
the
twirled
it
rapidly
and
with
a
uniform
motion
about
the
head
and
from
front
to
rear
and
succeeded
in
faithfully
imitating
the
sound
of
a
gust
of
wind
as
explained
to
me
by
one
of
the
by
making
this
sound
they
compelled
the
wind
and
rain
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
crops
at
a
later
date
i
found
it
in
use
among
the
apache
and
for
the
same
the
zuñi
indians
of
new
mexico
whirl
to
create
enthusiasm
among
the
mythical
beings
who
are
supposed
to
cause
rain
or
for
the
purpose
of
making
them
gather
in
the
air
over
the
village
in
a
zuñi
ceremony
while
one
whirls
a
another
whips
up
a
mixture
of
water
and
meal
into
frothy
suds
symbolic
of
clouds
and
a
third
plays
a
flute
all
this
is
an
invocation
to
the
gods
for
one
great
and
perpetual
prayer
of
the
people
of
this
arid
this
supposed
connexion
of
the
instrument
with
explains
why
the
navajos
of
the
same
torrid
country
say
that
the
should
always
be
made
of
wood
from
a
that
has
been
struck
by
lightning
and
why
the
bakairi
of
brazil
call
the
unpretentious
instrument
by
a
name
that
means
thunder
and
the
resemblance
of
the
sound
of
the
to
the
roaring
of
the
wind
is
doubtless
the
reason
why
in
the
torres
straits
islands
wizards
whirled
in
order
to
make
the
wind
to
blow
and
why
when
caffres
wish
for
calm
weather
they
forbid
boys
to
play
with
because
they
think
that
the
booming
noise
attracts
a
gale
of
wind
hence
as
an
instrument
whose
sound
resembles
the
rumbling
of
thunder
the
roar
of
wind
and
the
patter
of
rain
the
is
naturally
swung
by
agricultural
savages
as
a
powerful
means
of
promoting
the
growth
of
the
crops
in
the
island
of
kiwai
off
the
mouth
of
the
fly
river
in
british
new
guinea
are
whirled
in
order
to
ensure
a
good
crop
of
yams
sweet
potatoes
and
bananas
similarly
the
yabim
of
german
new
guinea
imagine
that
by
twirling
while
they
mention
the
names
of
the
dead
they
produce
a
fine
crop
of
taro
but
why
among
the
dieri
of
central
australia
should
the
power
of
attracting
rain
and
so
ensuring
a
supply
of
food
be
specially
attributed
to
a
young
man
whose
back
has
just
been
scored
and
whose
wounds
are
still
raw
perhaps
the
reason
may
be
that
the
blood
dripping
from
the
gashes
is
thought
to
resemble
rain
and
therefore
to
be
endowed
with
a
magical
potency
of
drawing
showers
from
the
clouds
the
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
the
dieri
actually
do
bleed
themselves
avowedly
for
the
purpose
of
making
rain
and
they
are
not
the
only
people
in
australia
and
elsewhere
who
have
resorted
to
this
singular
mode
of
putting
an
end
to
a
drought
altogether
the
foregoing
evidence
seems
to
hint
that
the
whole
virtue
of
the
resides
as
its
english
name
implies
in
its
voice
and
that
its
original
significance
was
simply
that
of
a
magical
instrument
for
causing
thunder
wind
and
rain
when
these
natural
phenomena
came
to
be
personified
as
spirits
the
sound
of
the
was
naturally
interpreted
as
their
voice
among
the
tribes
on
the
brisbane
river
in
queensland
the
weird
sound
of
the
swung
at
initiation
was
believed
by
the
women
and
children
to
be
made
by
the
wizards
in
swallowing
the
boys
and
bringing
them
up
again
as
young
men
the
ualaroi
of
the
upper
darling
river
said
that
the
boy
met
a
ghost
who
killed
him
and
brought
him
to
life
again
as
a
young
man
among
the
natives
on
the
lower
lachlan
and
murray
rivers
it
was
thrumalun
daramulun
who
was
thought
to
slay
and
resuscitate
the
novices
in
the
arunta
tribe
of
central
australia
at
the
moment
when
the
lads
are
being
circumcised
the
sounds
in
the
darkness
all
round
the
ceremonial
ground
and
the
awestruck
women
listening
in
the
distance
believe
that
it
is
the
voice
of
a
spirit
called
twanyirika
who
lives
in
wild
and
inaccessible
regions
and
only
comes
out
when
a
youth
is
initiated
they
think
that
the
spirit
enters
the
body
of
the
lad
after
the
operation
of
circumcision
has
been
performed
and
carries
him
away
into
the
bush
keeping
him
there
till
his
wound
is
healed
while
the
newly
circumcised
youth
is
out
in
the
wilds
carefully
secluded
from
the
sight
of
the
women
and
children
he
constantly
sounds
the
when
he
has
recovered
from
the
wound
the
spirit
leaves
him
and
he
returns
to
camp
an
initiated
or
rather
partially
initiated
man
he
has
learned
at
all
events
the
secret
of
twanyirika
for
no
sooner
is
he
circumcised
than
an
elder
brother
comes
up
to
him
and
placing
in
his
hands
a
bundle
of
sacred
sticks
or
stones
says
here
is
twanyirika
of
whom
you
have
heard
so
much
they
are
and
will
help
you
to
heal
quickly
guard
them
well
or
else
you
and
your
mothers
and
sisters
will
be
in
this
account
nothing
is
said
about
killing
the
lad
and
bringing
him
to
life
again
but
a
belief
in
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
novices
at
initiation
is
expressly
affirmed
to
be
part
of
the
feminine
creed
in
other
tribes
of
central
australia
thus
in
the
unmatjera
tribe
both
women
and
children
believe
that
twanyirika
kills
the
youth
and
afterwards
brings
him
to
life
again
during
the
period
of
initiation
the
rites
of
initiation
in
this
tribe
as
in
the
other
central
tribes
comprise
the
operations
of
circumcision
and
subincision
and
as
soon
as
the
second
of
these
has
been
performed
on
him
the
young
man
receives
from
his
father
a
sacred
stick
with
which
he
is
told
his
spirit
was
associated
in
the
remotest
past
while
he
is
out
in
the
bush
recovering
from
his
wounds
he
must
swing
the
or
a
being
who
lives
up
in
the
sky
will
swoop
down
and
carry
him
off
in
the
urabunna
tribe
of
central
australia
a
lad
at
initiation
receives
a
the
very
name
of
which
is
never
heard
by
women
and
children
they
are
taught
to
believe
that
the
sound
of
it
is
the
voice
of
a
spirit
called
witurna
who
takes
the
boy
away
cuts
out
all
his
bowels
provides
him
with
a
new
set
and
brings
him
back
an
initiated
youth
the
lad
is
warned
that
on
no
account
may
he
allow
a
woman
or
a
child
to
see
the
sacred
stick
else
he
and
his
mother
and
sisters
will
fall
down
as
dead
as
stones
in
the
binbinga
tribe
on
the
western
coast
of
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
the
women
and
children
believe
that
the
noise
of
the
at
initiation
is
made
by
a
spirit
named
katajalina
who
lives
in
an
and
comes
out
and
eats
up
the
boy
afterwards
restoring
him
to
life
similarly
among
their
neighbours
the
anula
the
women
imagine
that
the
droning
sound
of
the
is
produced
by
a
spirit
called
gnabaia
who
swallows
the
lads
at
initiation
and
afterwards
disgorges
them
in
the
form
of
initiated
men
in
this
tribe
after
a
lad
has
been
subincised
as
well
as
circumcised
he
is
presented
with
a
and
informed
that
the
instrument
was
originally
made
by
the
whirlwind
that
it
is
sacred
or
tabooed
and
that
it
may
on
no
account
be
shewn
to
women
or
children
among
the
tribes
settled
on
the
southern
coast
of
new
south
wales
of
which
the
coast
murring
tribe
may
be
regarded
as
typical
the
drama
of
resurrection
from
the
dead
was
exhibited
in
a
graphic
form
to
the
novices
at
initiation
before
they
were
privileged
to
witness
this
edifying
spectacle
they
had
been
raised
to
the
dignity
of
manhood
by
an
old
man
who
promoted
them
to
their
new
status
by
the
simple
process
of
knocking
a
tooth
out
of
the
mouth
of
each
with
the
help
of
a
wooden
chisel
and
hammer
the
ceremony
of
the
resurrection
has
been
described
for
us
in
detail
by
an
the
late
howitt
one
of
the
best
authorities
on
the
customs
of
the
australian
aborigines
the
scene
selected
for
the
sacred
drama
was
the
bottom
of
a
deep
valley
where
a
sluggish
stream
wound
through
a
bed
of
tall
sedge
though
the
hour
was
between
ten
and
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
sun
had
but
just
peeped
over
the
mountains
which
enclosed
the
valley
like
a
wall
on
the
east
and
while
the
upper
slopes
clothed
with
a
forest
of
tall
rowan
trees
looked
warm
and
bright
in
sunshine
which
shot
between
the
grey
stems
and
under
the
light
feathery
foliage
of
the
trees
all
the
bottom
of
the
dell
was
still
in
deep
shadow
and
dank
with
the
moisture
of
the
night
s
rain
while
the
novices
rested
and
warmed
themselves
at
a
crackling
fire
the
initiated
men
laid
their
heads
together
prepared
a
stock
of
decorations
made
of
stringy
bark
and
dug
a
grave
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
the
shape
of
the
grave
but
the
man
who
was
to
be
buried
in
it
decided
the
question
by
declaring
that
he
would
be
laid
in
it
on
his
back
at
full
length
he
was
a
man
of
the
totem
and
belonged
to
the
tribal
subdivision
called
yibai
so
while
two
men
under
his
directions
were
digging
the
grave
with
sticks
in
the
friable
granitic
soil
he
superintended
the
costume
of
the
other
actors
in
the
drama
sheets
of
bark
were
beaten
out
into
fleeces
of
stringy
fibre
and
in
these
garments
six
performers
were
clothed
from
head
to
foot
so
that
not
even
a
glimpse
could
be
obtained
of
their
faces
four
of
them
were
tied
together
by
a
cord
which
was
fastened
to
the
back
of
their
heads
and
each
of
them
carried
two
pieces
of
bark
in
his
hands
the
other
two
walked
free
but
hobbled
along
bent
double
and
supporting
their
tottery
steps
on
staves
to
mark
the
weight
of
years
for
they
played
the
part
of
two
of
venerable
age
and
great
magical
power
by
this
time
the
grave
was
ready
and
the
man
stretched
himself
in
it
at
full
length
on
a
bed
of
leaves
his
head
resting
on
a
blanket
just
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
in
his
two
hands
crossed
on
his
chest
he
held
the
stem
of
a
young
tree
which
had
been
pulled
up
by
the
roots
and
now
stood
planted
on
his
chest
so
that
the
top
of
it
rose
several
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
a
light
covering
of
dried
sticks
filled
the
grave
and
dead
leaves
tufts
of
grass
and
small
plants
were
artistically
arranged
over
them
so
as
to
complete
the
illusion
all
being
now
ready
the
novices
were
led
by
their
sisters
husbands
to
the
grave
and
placed
in
a
row
beside
it
while
a
singer
perched
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
at
the
head
of
the
grave
crooned
a
melancholy
ditty
the
song
of
yibai
though
the
words
of
the
song
consisted
merely
of
a
monotonous
repetition
of
the
words
that
is
yibai
they
were
understood
to
refer
to
the
totem
as
well
as
to
the
tribal
subdivision
of
the
buried
man
then
to
the
slow
plaintive
but
air
of
the
song
the
actors
began
to
move
forward
winding
among
the
trees
logs
and
rocks
on
came
the
four
disguised
men
stepping
in
time
to
the
music
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
clashing
their
bark
clappers
together
at
every
step
while
beside
them
hobbled
the
two
old
men
keeping
a
little
aloof
to
mark
their
superior
dignity
they
represented
a
party
of
guided
by
two
reverend
seniors
who
had
come
on
pilgrimage
to
the
grave
of
a
brother
him
of
the
totem
who
lay
buried
here
in
the
lonely
valley
now
illumined
by
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
for
by
this
time
the
morning
was
wearing
on
to
noon
when
the
little
procession
chanting
an
invocation
to
daramulun
had
defiled
from
among
the
rocks
and
trees
into
the
open
it
drew
up
on
the
side
of
the
grave
opposite
to
the
novices
the
two
old
men
taking
up
a
position
in
the
rear
of
the
dancers
for
some
time
the
dance
and
song
went
on
till
the
tree
that
seemed
to
grow
from
the
grave
began
to
quiver
look
there
cried
the
sisters
husbands
to
the
novices
pointing
to
the
trembling
leaves
as
they
looked
the
tree
quivered
more
and
more
then
was
violently
agitated
and
fell
to
the
ground
while
amid
the
excited
dancing
of
the
dancers
and
the
chanting
of
the
tuneful
choir
the
supposed
dead
man
spurned
from
him
the
superincumbent
mass
of
sticks
and
leaves
and
springing
to
his
feet
danced
his
magic
dance
in
the
grave
itself
and
exhibited
in
his
mouth
the
magic
substances
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
received
from
daramulun
in
person
in
some
tribes
of
central
and
northern
australia
the
initiation
of
a
into
the
mysteries
of
his
craft
is
supposed
to
be
accomplished
by
certain
spirits
who
kill
him
cut
out
his
internal
organs
and
having
provided
him
with
a
new
set
bring
him
to
life
again
sometimes
the
spirits
kindly
replace
the
man
s
human
organs
by
their
own
spiritual
organs
sometimes
along
with
the
new
organs
they
insert
magical
stones
in
his
body
or
even
a
serpent
and
the
stones
or
the
serpents
naturally
endow
the
new
wizards
with
marvellous
powers
in
some
tribes
the
initiation
takes
place
in
a
cave
where
the
spirits
dwell
after
the
man
has
been
restored
to
life
with
a
new
heart
a
new
pair
of
lungs
and
so
forth
he
returns
to
his
people
in
a
more
or
less
dazed
condition
which
his
friends
may
at
first
mistake
for
insanity
though
afterwards
they
recognize
its
true
character
as
inspiration
one
eminent
medical
practitioner
in
the
unmatjera
tribe
assured
spencer
and
gillen
that
when
he
came
to
himself
after
the
operation
which
in
his
case
was
performed
by
an
aged
doctor
he
had
completely
forgotten
who
he
was
and
all
about
his
past
life
after
a
time
his
venerable
friend
led
him
back
to
the
camp
and
shewed
it
to
him
and
said
that
woman
there
is
your
wife
for
she
had
gone
clean
out
of
his
head
we
shall
see
presently
that
this
temporary
oblivion
a
natural
effect
of
the
shock
to
the
nervous
system
produced
by
resuscitation
from
the
dead
is
characteristic
of
novices
under
similar
circumstances
in
other
lands
among
the
arunta
of
alice
springs
the
cave
where
the
mystic
initiation
takes
place
is
a
limestone
cavern
in
a
range
of
hills
which
rises
to
the
north
of
the
wide
level
expanse
known
as
the
emily
plain
none
of
the
ordinary
natives
would
dare
to
set
foot
in
the
awful
grotto
which
they
believe
to
extend
for
miles
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
to
be
tenanted
by
certain
ancestral
spirits
who
live
there
in
perpetual
sunshine
and
amid
streams
of
running
water
an
earthly
paradise
by
contrast
with
the
arid
steppes
and
barren
mountains
outside
white
men
have
explored
the
cave
and
if
they
perceived
no
spirits
they
found
bats
in
plenty
the
man
who
aspires
to
the
rank
of
a
wizard
lies
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
falls
asleep
and
as
he
sleeps
one
of
the
ancestral
spirits
steals
up
to
him
and
drives
an
invisible
spear
through
his
neck
from
back
to
front
the
point
of
the
spear
comes
out
through
the
man
s
tongue
leaving
a
hole
through
which
you
could
put
your
little
finger
and
this
hole
the
man
retains
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
or
at
least
so
long
as
he
retains
his
magical
powers
for
if
the
hole
should
close
up
these
spiritual
gifts
and
graces
would
depart
from
him
a
second
thrust
from
the
invisible
spear
transfixes
the
man
s
head
from
ear
to
ear
he
drops
down
dead
and
is
immediately
transported
into
the
depths
of
the
cavern
where
the
spirits
dissect
his
dead
body
extract
the
old
viscera
and
replace
them
with
a
new
set
in
the
manner
already
described
in
this
account
of
the
manner
in
which
obtain
their
magical
powers
not
only
are
the
supposed
death
and
resurrection
of
the
novice
worthy
of
attention
but
also
the
exchange
of
internal
organs
which
in
the
binbinga
and
mara
tribes
is
supposed
to
be
effected
between
the
man
and
the
spirit
for
this
exchange
resembles
that
which
on
the
theory
i
have
suggested
may
be
thought
to
take
place
between
a
lad
and
his
totem
at
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
which
mark
the
momentous
transition
from
boyhood
to
manhood
further
the
bodily
mutilation
which
is
the
visible
sign
of
the
s
initiation
for
however
the
hole
may
be
made
it
certainly
exists
in
the
tongues
of
regular
arunta
practitioners
corresponds
to
the
bodily
mutilations
of
other
sorts
which
in
many
savage
tribes
attest
to
the
world
that
the
mutilated
persons
are
fullgrown
men
what
the
precise
meaning
of
such
mutilations
may
be
still
remains
very
obscure
but
they
seem
in
some
cases
to
be
directly
associated
with
the
conception
of
death
and
resurrection
this
association
certainly
comes
out
plainly
in
the
rites
of
initiation
through
which
in
some
parts
of
new
guinea
all
lads
must
pass
before
they
attain
to
the
status
of
adults
the
rites
are
observed
by
a
group
of
tribes
who
occupy
contiguous
territories
about
finsch
harbour
and
huon
gulf
in
german
new
guinea
the
tribes
in
question
are
the
yabim
the
bukaua
the
kai
and
the
tami
all
of
them
except
the
kai
belong
to
the
melanesian
stock
and
are
therefore
presumably
immigrants
from
the
adjoining
islands
but
the
kai
who
inhabit
the
rugged
densely
wooded
and
rainy
mountains
inland
from
finsch
harbour
belong
to
the
aboriginal
papuan
stock
and
differ
from
their
neighbours
in
speech
as
well
as
in
appearance
yet
the
rites
of
initiation
which
all
these
tribes
celebrate
and
the
beliefs
which
they
associate
with
them
are
so
similar
that
a
single
description
will
apply
accurately
enough
to
them
all
all
of
them
like
many
australian
tribes
require
every
male
member
of
the
tribe
to
be
circumcised
before
he
ranks
as
a
man
and
the
tribal
initiation
of
which
circumcision
is
the
central
feature
is
conceived
by
them
as
by
some
australian
tribes
as
a
process
of
being
swallowed
and
disgorged
by
a
mythical
monster
whose
voice
is
heard
in
the
humming
sound
of
the
indeed
the
new
guinea
tribes
not
only
impress
this
belief
on
the
minds
of
women
and
children
but
enact
it
in
a
dramatic
form
at
the
actual
rites
of
initiation
at
which
no
woman
or
uninitiated
person
may
be
present
for
this
purpose
a
hut
about
a
hundred
feet
long
is
erected
either
in
the
village
or
in
a
lonely
part
of
the
forest
it
is
modelled
in
the
shape
of
the
mythical
monster
at
the
end
which
represents
his
head
it
is
high
and
it
tapers
away
at
the
other
end
a
grubbed
up
with
the
roots
stands
for
the
backbone
of
the
great
being
and
its
clustering
fibres
for
his
hair
and
to
complete
the
resemblance
the
butt
end
of
the
building
is
adorned
by
a
native
artist
with
a
pair
of
goggle
eyes
and
a
gaping
mouth
when
after
a
tearful
parting
from
their
mothers
and
women
folk
who
believe
or
pretend
to
believe
in
the
monster
that
swallows
their
dear
ones
the
novices
are
brought
face
to
face
with
this
imposing
structure
the
huge
creature
emits
a
sullen
growl
which
is
in
fact
no
other
than
the
humming
note
of
swung
by
men
concealed
in
the
monster
s
belly
the
actual
process
of
deglutition
is
variously
enacted
among
the
tami
it
is
represented
by
causing
the
candidates
to
defile
past
a
row
of
men
who
hold
over
their
heads
among
the
kai
it
is
more
graphically
set
forth
by
making
them
pass
under
a
scaffold
on
which
stands
a
man
who
makes
a
gesture
of
swallowing
and
takes
in
fact
a
gulp
of
water
as
each
trembling
novice
passes
beneath
him
but
the
present
of
a
pig
opportunely
offered
for
the
redemption
of
the
youth
induces
the
monster
to
relent
and
disgorge
his
victim
the
man
who
represents
the
monster
accepts
the
gift
vicariously
a
gurgling
sound
is
heard
and
the
water
which
had
just
been
swallowed
descends
in
a
jet
on
the
novice
this
signifies
that
the
young
man
has
been
released
from
the
monster
s
belly
however
he
has
now
to
undergo
the
more
painful
and
dangerous
operation
of
circumcision
it
follows
immediately
and
the
cut
made
by
the
knife
of
the
operator
is
explained
to
be
a
bite
or
scratch
which
the
monster
inflicted
on
the
novice
in
spewing
him
out
of
his
capacious
maw
while
the
operation
is
proceeding
a
prodigious
noise
is
made
by
the
swinging
of
to
represent
the
roar
of
the
dreadful
being
who
is
in
the
act
of
swallowing
the
young
men
when
as
sometimes
happens
a
lad
dies
from
the
effect
of
the
operation
he
is
buried
secretly
in
the
forest
and
his
sorrowing
mother
is
told
that
the
monster
has
a
pig
s
stomach
as
well
as
a
human
stomach
and
that
unfortunately
her
son
slipped
into
the
wrong
stomach
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
extricate
him
after
they
have
been
circumcised
the
lads
must
remain
for
some
months
in
seclusion
shunning
all
contact
with
women
and
even
the
sight
of
them
they
live
in
the
long
hut
which
represents
the
monster
s
belly
among
the
yabim
they
beguile
the
tedium
of
this
enforced
leisure
by
weaving
baskets
and
playing
on
certain
sacred
flutes
which
are
never
used
except
on
these
occasions
the
instruments
are
of
two
patterns
one
is
called
the
male
and
the
other
the
female
and
they
are
believed
to
be
married
to
each
other
no
woman
may
see
these
mysterious
flutes
if
she
did
she
would
die
when
the
long
seclusion
is
over
the
lads
now
ranking
as
initiated
men
are
brought
back
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
to
the
village
where
they
are
received
with
sobs
and
tears
of
joy
by
the
women
as
if
the
grave
had
given
up
its
dead
at
first
the
young
men
keep
their
eyes
rigidly
closed
or
even
sealed
with
a
plaster
of
chalk
and
they
appear
not
to
understand
the
words
of
command
which
are
given
them
by
an
elder
gradually
however
they
come
to
themselves
as
if
awaking
from
a
stupor
and
next
day
they
bathe
and
wash
off
the
crust
of
white
chalk
with
which
their
bodies
had
been
coated
it
is
highly
significant
that
all
these
tribes
of
new
guinea
apply
the
same
word
to
the
and
to
the
monster
who
is
supposed
to
swallow
the
novices
at
circumcision
and
whose
fearful
roar
is
represented
by
the
hum
of
the
harmless
wooden
instruments
the
word
in
the
speech
of
the
yabim
and
bukaua
is
in
that
of
the
kai
it
is
and
in
that
of
the
tami
it
is
further
it
deserves
to
be
noted
that
in
three
languages
out
of
the
four
the
same
word
which
is
applied
to
the
and
to
the
monster
means
also
a
ghost
or
spirit
of
the
dead
while
in
the
fourth
language
the
kai
it
signifies
from
this
it
seems
to
follow
that
the
being
who
swallows
and
disgorges
the
novices
at
initiation
is
believed
to
be
a
powerful
ghost
or
ancestral
spirit
and
that
the
which
bears
his
name
is
his
material
representative
that
would
explain
the
jealous
secrecy
with
which
the
sacred
implement
is
kept
from
the
sight
of
women
while
they
are
not
in
use
the
are
stowed
away
in
the
men
s
which
no
woman
may
enter
indeed
no
woman
or
uninitiated
person
may
set
eyes
on
a
under
pain
of
death
similarly
among
the
tugeri
or
a
large
papuan
tribe
on
the
south
coast
of
dutch
new
guinea
the
name
of
the
which
they
call
is
given
to
a
mythical
giant
who
is
supposed
to
appear
every
year
with
the
monsoon
when
he
comes
a
festival
is
held
in
his
honour
and
are
swung
boys
are
presented
to
the
giant
and
he
kills
them
but
considerately
brings
them
to
life
again
in
certain
districts
of
viti
levu
the
largest
of
the
fijian
islands
the
drama
of
death
and
resurrection
used
to
be
acted
with
much
solemnity
before
the
eyes
of
young
men
at
initiation
the
ceremonies
were
performed
in
certain
sacred
precincts
of
oblong
shape
enclosed
by
low
walls
or
rows
of
stones
but
open
to
the
sky
such
a
precinct
was
called
a
and
it
might
be
described
as
a
temple
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
ancestors
for
in
it
sacrifices
and
prayers
were
offered
to
the
ancestral
spirits
for
example
the
of
the
yam
harvest
were
regularly
presented
with
great
ceremony
to
the
souls
of
the
dead
in
the
temple
before
the
bulk
of
the
crop
was
dug
for
the
people
s
use
and
no
man
might
taste
of
the
new
yams
until
this
solemn
offering
had
been
made
the
yams
so
offered
were
piled
up
in
the
sacred
enclosure
and
left
to
rot
there
if
any
man
were
so
bold
as
to
eat
of
these
dedicated
fruits
it
was
believed
that
he
would
go
mad
any
initiated
man
had
the
right
of
approaching
the
ancestral
spirits
at
any
time
in
their
holy
place
where
he
would
pray
to
them
for
help
and
protection
and
propitiate
them
by
laying
down
his
offering
of
a
pig
or
yams
or
eels
or
cloth
or
what
not
of
these
offerings
perhaps
the
most
curious
was
that
of
the
foreskins
of
young
men
who
were
circumcised
as
a
sort
of
vicarious
sacrifice
or
atonement
for
the
recovery
of
a
sick
relative
it
might
be
either
their
father
or
one
of
their
father
s
brothers
the
bloody
foreskins
stuck
in
the
cleft
of
a
split
reed
were
presented
to
the
ancestral
gods
in
the
temple
by
the
chief
priest
who
prayed
for
the
sick
man
s
recovery
the
temple
or
sacred
enclosure
was
divided
into
two
or
three
compartments
by
cross
walls
of
stones
and
the
inmost
of
these
compartments
was
the
or
holy
of
holies
in
these
temples
of
the
dead
the
ceremony
of
initiating
young
men
was
performed
as
a
rule
every
year
at
the
end
of
october
or
the
beginning
of
november
which
was
the
commencement
of
the
fijian
new
year
hence
the
novices
who
were
initiated
at
that
season
went
by
the
name
of
or
new
year
s
men
the
exact
time
for
celebrating
the
rite
was
determined
by
the
flowering
of
the
tree
but
it
roughly
coincided
with
the
new
year
of
the
tahitians
and
hawaiians
who
dated
the
commencement
of
the
year
by
observation
of
the
pleiades
the
highlanders
of
fiji
who
alone
celebrated
these
rites
did
not
trouble
their
heads
about
the
stars
as
a
preparation
for
the
solemnity
the
heads
of
the
novices
were
shaved
and
their
beards
if
they
had
any
were
carefully
eradicated
on
four
successive
days
they
went
in
procession
to
the
temple
and
there
deposited
in
the
holy
of
holies
their
offerings
of
cloth
and
weapons
to
the
ancestral
spirits
but
on
the
fifth
and
great
day
of
the
festival
when
they
again
entered
the
sacred
ground
they
beheld
a
sight
which
froze
their
souls
with
horror
stretched
on
the
ground
was
a
row
of
dead
or
seemingly
dead
and
murdered
men
their
bodies
cut
open
and
covered
with
blood
their
entrails
protruding
at
the
further
end
sat
the
high
priest
regarding
them
with
a
stony
glare
and
to
reach
him
the
trembling
novices
had
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
over
the
ghastly
corpses
that
lay
between
having
done
so
they
drew
up
in
a
line
before
him
suddenly
he
blurted
out
a
piercing
yell
at
which
the
counterfeit
dead
men
started
to
their
feet
and
ran
down
to
the
river
to
cleanse
themselves
from
the
blood
and
guts
of
pigs
with
which
they
were
beslobbered
the
high
priest
now
unbent
his
starched
dignity
and
skipping
from
side
to
side
cried
in
stridulous
tones
where
are
the
people
of
my
enclosure
are
they
gone
to
tonga
levu
are
they
gone
to
the
deep
sea
he
was
soon
answered
by
a
chant
and
back
from
the
river
marched
the
dead
men
come
to
life
clean
fresh
and
garlanded
swaying
their
bodies
in
time
to
the
music
of
their
solemn
hymn
they
took
their
places
in
front
of
the
novices
and
a
religious
silence
ensued
such
was
the
drama
of
death
and
resurrection
it
was
immediately
followed
by
a
sacramental
meal
four
old
men
of
the
highest
order
of
initiates
now
entered
the
holy
of
holies
the
first
bore
a
cooked
yam
carefully
wrapt
up
in
leaves
so
that
no
part
of
it
should
touch
the
hands
of
the
bearer
the
second
carried
a
piece
of
baked
pork
similarly
enveloped
the
third
held
a
full
of
water
and
wrapt
round
with
native
cloth
and
the
fourth
bore
a
napkin
of
the
same
stuff
the
first
elder
passed
along
the
row
of
novices
putting
the
end
of
the
yam
into
each
of
their
mouths
and
as
he
did
so
each
of
them
nibbled
a
morsel
of
the
sacred
food
the
second
elder
did
the
same
with
the
hallowed
pork
the
third
elder
followed
with
the
holy
water
with
which
each
novice
merely
wetted
his
lips
and
the
fourth
elder
wiped
all
their
mouths
with
his
napkin
then
the
high
priest
or
one
of
the
elders
addressed
the
young
men
warning
them
solemnly
against
the
sacrilege
of
betraying
to
the
profane
vulgar
any
of
the
high
mysteries
which
they
had
witnessed
and
threatening
all
such
traitors
with
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
the
general
intention
of
the
initiatory
rites
seems
to
have
been
to
introduce
the
young
men
to
the
worshipful
spirits
of
the
dead
at
their
temple
and
to
cement
the
bond
between
them
by
a
sacramental
meal
the
people
of
rook
an
island
between
new
guinea
and
new
britain
hold
festivals
at
which
one
or
two
disguised
men
their
heads
covered
with
wooden
masks
go
dancing
through
the
village
followed
by
all
the
other
men
they
demand
that
the
circumcised
boys
who
have
not
yet
been
swallowed
by
marsaba
the
devil
shall
be
given
up
to
them
the
boys
trembling
and
shrieking
are
delivered
to
them
and
must
creep
between
the
legs
of
the
disguised
men
then
the
procession
moves
through
the
village
again
and
announces
that
marsaba
has
eaten
up
the
boys
and
will
not
disgorge
them
till
he
receives
a
present
of
pigs
taro
and
so
forth
so
all
the
villagers
according
to
their
means
contribute
provisions
which
are
then
consumed
in
the
name
of
marsaba
in
new
britain
all
males
are
members
of
an
association
called
the
the
boys
are
admitted
to
it
very
young
but
are
not
fully
initiated
till
their
fourteenth
year
when
they
receive
from
the
tubuvan
or
tubuan
a
terrible
blow
with
a
cane
which
is
supposed
to
kill
them
the
tubuan
and
the
are
two
disguised
men
who
represent
cassowaries
they
dance
with
a
short
hopping
step
in
imitation
of
the
cassowary
each
of
them
wears
a
huge
hat
like
an
extinguisher
woven
of
grass
or
it
is
six
feet
high
and
descends
to
the
wearer
s
shoulders
completely
concealing
his
head
and
face
from
the
neck
to
the
knees
the
man
s
body
is
hidden
by
a
crinoline
made
of
the
leaves
of
a
certain
tree
fastened
on
hoops
one
above
the
other
the
tubuan
is
regarded
as
a
female
the
as
a
male
the
former
is
supposed
to
breed
and
give
birth
to
the
novices
who
are
accordingly
looked
upon
as
newly
born
the
female
masks
are
very
plain
compared
with
the
male
masks
two
of
them
are
regularly
kept
from
year
to
year
in
order
that
they
may
annually
breed
new
when
they
are
wanted
for
this
purpose
they
are
brought
forth
decorated
afresh
and
provided
with
new
leaf
dresses
to
match
according
to
one
account
women
and
children
may
not
look
upon
one
of
these
disguised
men
or
they
would
die
so
strong
is
this
superstition
among
them
that
they
will
run
away
and
hide
as
soon
as
they
hear
him
coming
for
they
are
aware
of
his
approach
through
a
peculiar
shrieking
noise
he
utters
as
he
goes
along
in
the
district
of
berara
where
red
is
the
colour
the
mere
sight
of
a
red
cloth
is
enough
to
make
the
women
take
to
their
heels
the
common
herd
are
not
allowed
to
know
who
the
masker
is
if
he
stumbles
and
his
hat
falls
to
the
ground
disclosing
his
face
or
his
crinoline
is
torn
to
tatters
by
the
bushes
his
attendants
immediately
surround
him
to
hide
his
person
from
the
vulgar
eye
according
to
one
writer
indeed
the
performer
who
drops
his
mask
or
lets
it
fall
so
that
the
sharp
point
at
the
top
sticks
in
the
ground
is
put
to
death
the
institution
of
the
is
common
to
the
neighbouring
islands
of

ireland
and

boys
go
through
a
form
of
initiation
part
of
which
seems
to
consist
in
a
pretence
of
begetting
them
anew
when
a
number
of
boys
have
reached
the
proper
age
their
parents
agree
to
celebrate
the
ceremony
at
their
common
expense
and
they
invite
others
to
be
present
at
it
a
shed
is
erected
and
two
long
tables
are
placed
in
it
with
benches
to
match
one
for
the
men
and
one
for
the
women
when
all
the
preparations
have
been
made
for
a
feast
a
great
many
skins
of
the
rayfish
and
some
pieces
of
a
wood
which
imparts
a
red
colour
to
water
are
taken
to
the
shed
a
priest
or
elder
causes
a
vessel
to
be
placed
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
and
then
begins
with
significant
gestures
to
rub
a
piece
of
the
wood
with
the
the
powder
so
produced
is
put
in
the
vessel
and
at
the
same
time
the
name
of
one
of
the
boys
is
called
out
the
same
proceeding
is
repeated
for
each
boy
then
the
vessels
are
filled
with
water
after
which
the
feast
begins
at
the
third
the
priest
smears
the
faces
and
bodies
of
the
boys
with
the
red
water
which
represents
the
blood
shed
at
the
perforation
of
the
towards
daybreak
the
boys
are
taken
to
the
wood
and
must
hide
behind
the
largest
trees
the
men
armed
with
sword
and
shield
accompany
them
dancing
and
singing
the
priest
knocks
thrice
on
each
of
the
trees
behind
which
a
boy
is
hiding
all
day
the
boys
stay
in
the
wood
exposing
themselves
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
as
much
as
possible
in
the
evening
they
bathe
and
return
to
the
shed
where
the
women
supply
them
with
food
in
the
west
of
ceram
boys
at
puberty
are
admitted
to
the
kakian
association
modern
writers
have
commonly
regarded
this
association
as
primarily
a
political
league
instituted
to
resist
foreign
domination
in
reality
its
objects
are
purely
religious
and
social
though
it
is
possible
that
the
priests
may
have
occasionally
used
their
powerful
influence
for
political
ends
the
society
is
in
fact
merely
one
of
those
primitive
institutions
of
which
a
chief
object
is
the
initiation
of
young
men
in
recent
years
the
true
nature
of
the
association
has
been
duly
recognized
by
the
distinguished
dutch
ethnologist
riedel
the
kakian
house
is
an
oblong
wooden
shed
situated
under
the
darkest
trees
in
the
depth
of
the
forest
and
is
built
to
admit
so
little
light
that
it
is
impossible
to
see
what
goes
on
in
it
every
village
has
such
a
house
thither
the
boys
who
are
to
be
initiated
are
conducted
blindfold
followed
by
their
parents
and
relations
each
boy
is
led
by
the
hand
by
two
men
who
act
as
his
sponsors
or
guardians
looking
after
him
during
the
period
of
initiation
when
all
are
assembled
before
the
shed
the
high
priest
calls
aloud
upon
the
devils
immediately
a
hideous
uproar
is
heard
to
proceed
from
the
shed
it
is
made
by
men
with
bamboo
trumpets
who
have
been
secretly
introduced
into
the
building
by
a
back
door
but
the
women
and
children
think
it
is
made
by
the
devils
and
are
much
terrified
then
the
priests
enter
the
shed
followed
by
the
boys
one
at
a
time
as
soon
as
each
boy
has
disappeared
within
the
precincts
a
dull
chopping
sound
is
heard
a
fearful
cry
rings
out
and
a
sword
or
spear
dripping
with
blood
is
thrust
through
the
roof
of
the
shed
this
is
a
token
that
the
boy
s
head
has
been
cut
off
and
that
the
devil
has
carried
him
away
to
the
other
world
there
to
regenerate
and
transform
him
so
at
sight
of
the
bloody
sword
the
mothers
weep
and
wail
crying
that
the
devil
has
murdered
their
children
in
some
places
it
would
seem
the
boys
are
pushed
through
an
opening
made
in
the
shape
of
a
crocodile
s
jaws
or
a
cassowary
s
beak
and
it
is
then
said
that
the
devil
has
swallowed
them
the
boys
remain
in
the
shed
for
five
or
nine
days
sitting
in
the
dark
they
hear
the
blast
of
the
bamboo
trumpets
and
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
musket
shots
and
the
clash
of
swords
every
day
they
bathe
and
their
faces
and
bodies
are
smeared
with
a
yellow
dye
to
give
them
the
appearance
of
having
been
swallowed
by
the
devil
during
his
stay
in
the
kakian
house
each
boy
has
one
or
two
crosses
tattooed
with
thorns
on
his
breast
or
arm
when
they
are
not
sleeping
the
lads
must
sit
in
a
crouching
posture
without
moving
a
muscle
as
they
sit
in
a
row
with
their
hands
stretched
out
the
chief
takes
his
trumpet
and
placing
the
mouth
of
it
on
the
hands
of
each
lad
speaks
through
it
in
strange
tones
imitating
the
voice
of
the
spirits
he
warns
the
lads
under
pain
of
death
to
observe
the
rules
of
the
kakian
society
and
never
to
reveal
what
has
passed
in
the
kakian
house
the
novices
are
also
told
by
the
priests
to
behave
well
to
their
blood
relations
and
are
taught
the
traditions
and
secrets
of
the
tribe
meantime
the
mothers
and
sisters
of
the
lads
have
gone
home
to
weep
and
mourn
but
in
a
day
or
two
the
men
who
acted
as
guardians
or
sponsors
to
the
novices
return
to
the
village
with
the
glad
tidings
that
the
devil
at
the
intercession
of
the
priests
has
restored
the
lads
to
life
the
men
who
bring
this
news
come
in
a
fainting
state
and
daubed
with
mud
like
messengers
freshly
arrived
from
the
nether
world
before
leaving
the
kakian
house
each
lad
receives
from
the
priest
a
stick
adorned
at
both
ends
with
cock
s
or
cassowary
s
feathers
the
sticks
are
supposed
to
have
been
given
to
the
lads
by
the
devil
at
the
time
when
he
restored
them
to
life
and
they
serve
as
a
token
that
the
youths
have
been
in
the
spirit
land
when
they
return
to
their
homes
they
totter
in
their
walk
and
enter
the
house
backward
as
if
they
had
forgotten
how
to
walk
properly
or
they
enter
the
house
by
the
back
door
if
a
plate
of
food
is
given
to
them
they
hold
it
upside
down
they
remain
dumb
indicating
their
wants
by
signs
only
all
this
is
to
shew
that
they
are
still
under
the
influence
of
the
devil
or
the
spirits
their
sponsors
have
to
teach
them
all
the
common
acts
of
life
as
if
they
were
children
further
upon
leaving
the
kakian
house
the
boys
are
strictly
forbidden
to
eat
of
certain
fruits
until
the
next
celebration
of
the
rites
has
taken
place
and
for
twenty
or
thirty
days
their
hair
may
not
be
combed
by
their
mothers
or
sisters
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
high
priest
takes
them
to
a
lonely
place
in
the
forest
and
cuts
off
a
lock
of
hair
from
the
crown
of
each
of
their
heads
after
these
initiatory
rites
the
lads
are
deemed
men
and
may
marry
it
would
be
a
scandal
if
they
married
before
in
the
region
of
the
lower
congo
a
simulation
of
death
and
resurrection
is
or
rather
used
to
be
practised
by
the
members
of
a
guild
or
secret
society
called
the
society
had
nothing
to
do
with
puberty
or
circumcision
though
the
custom
of
circumcision
is
common
in
the
country
young
people
and
adults
of
both
sexes
might
join
the
guild
after
initiation
they
were
called
the
knowing
ones
to
found
a
branch
of
the
society
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
albino
who
whether
a
child
lad
or
adult
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
society
the
ostensible
reason
for
starting
a
branch
of
the
guild
in
a
district
was
commonly
an
epidemic
of
sickness
and
the
idea
was
to
go
into
to
die
and
after
an
indefinite
period
from
a
few
months
to
two
or
three
years
to
be
resurrected
with
a
new
body
not
liable
to
the
sickness
then
troubling
the
countryside
another
reason
for
starting
a
was
a
dearth
of
children
in
a
district
it
was
believed
that
good
luck
in
having
children
would
attend
those
who
entered
or
died
but
the
underlying
idea
was
the
same
to
get
a
new
body
that
would
be
healthy
and
perform
its
functions
the
quarters
of
the
society
were
always
a
stockaded
enclosure
in
a
great
thick
forest
a
gate
of
planks
painted
yellow
and
red
gave
access
to
it
and
within
there
was
an
assemblage
of
huts
the
place
was
fenced
to
keep
intruders
from
prying
into
the
mysteries
of
the
guild
and
it
was
near
water
uninitiated
persons
might
walk
on
the
public
roads
through
the
forest
but
if
they
were
caught
in
or
hunting
in
the
woods
they
were
flogged
fined
and
sometimes
killed
they
might
not
even
look
upon
the
persons
of
those
who
had
died
hence
when
these
sanctified
persons
were
roving
about
the
forest
or
going
to
the
river
the
booming
notes
of
a
drum
warned
the
profane
vulgar
to
keep
out
of
their
way
when
the
stockade
and
the
huts
in
the
forest
were
ready
to
receive
all
who
wished
to
put
off
the
old
man
or
woman
and
to
put
on
the
new
one
of
the
initiates
gave
the
sign
and
the
aspirant
after
the
higher
life
dropped
down
like
dead
in
some
public
place
it
might
be
the
market
or
the
centre
of
the
town
where
there
were
plenty
of
people
to
witness
the
edifying
spectacle
the
initiates
immediately
spread
a
pall
over
him
or
her
beat
the
earth
round
about
the
pretended
corpse
with
plantain
stalks
chanted
incantations
fired
guns
and
cut
capers
then
they
carried
the
seemingly
dead
body
away
into
the
forest
and
disappeared
with
it
into
the
stockade
the
spectacle
proved
infectious
one
after
another
in
the
emotional
excitable
crowd
of
negroes
followed
the
example
dropped
down
like
dead
and
were
carried
off
sometimes
in
a
real
cataleptic
state
in
this
way
fifty
to
a
hundred
or
more
novices
might
feign
death
and
be
transported
into
the
sacred
enclosure
there
they
were
supposed
not
only
to
die
but
to
rot
till
only
a
single
bone
of
their
body
remained
of
which
the
initiated
had
to
take
the
greatest
care
in
expectation
of
the
joyful
resurrection
that
was
soon
to
follow
however
though
they
were
both
dead
and
rotten
they
consumed
a
large
quantity
of
food
which
their
credulous
relatives
brought
to
them
in
baskets
toiling
with
the
loads
on
their
backs
over
the
long
paths
through
the
forest
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
the
tropical
day
if
the
relations
failed
to
discharge
this
pious
and
indispensable
duty
their
kinsman
in
the
sacred
enclosure
ran
a
risk
of
dying
in
good
earnest
or
rather
of
being
spirited
away
to
a
distant
town
and
sold
as
a
slave
shut
up
within
the
stockade
for
months
or
years
the
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
dispensed
with
the
superfluity
of
clothes
rubbed
their
naked
bodies
with
red
ochre
or
powdered
camwood
instead
and
gave
themselves
up
to
orgies
of
unbridled
lust
some
feeble
attempts
were
made
to
teach
them
the
rudiments
of
a
secret
language
but
the
vocabulary
was
small
and
its
principles
lacking
in
ingenuity
the
time
during
which
this
seclusion
lasted
might
vary
from
three
months
to
three
years
when
the
circumstances
which
had
furnished
the
pretext
for
instituting
the
society
had
passed
away
whether
it
was
that
the
epidemic
had
died
out
or
that
the
had
sensibly
increased
murmurs
would
begin
to
be
heard
among
friends
and
relatives
in
the
town
who
did
not
see
why
they
should
be
taxed
any
longer
to
support
a
set
of
idle
and
dissolute
ruffians
in
the
forest
and
why
they
should
trudge
day
after
day
in
the
sweat
of
their
brow
to
carry
provisions
to
them
so
the
supplies
would
begin
to
run
short
and
whenever
that
happened
the
mystery
of
the
resurrection
was
sure
to
follow
very
soon
after
accordingly
it
would
be
announced
that
on
a
certain
the
new
initiates
now
raised
from
the
dead
would
reveal
themselves
in
all
their
glory
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
the
public
the
glad
tidings
were
received
with
enthusiasm
and
crowds
assembled
from
all
the
country
round
about
to
welcome
those
who
had
come
back
from
the
world
beyond
the
grave
when
all
were
gathered
in
eager
expectancy
in
the
the
sounds
of
distant
music
would
be
heard
and
soon
the
gay
procession
would
defile
into
the
open
square
and
march
round
it
while
the
dusky
skins
reddened
with
camwood
powder
glistened
in
the
sunshine
the
gay
garments
fluttered
in
the
wind
and
the
tassels
of
fibre
dangled
at
every
arm
in
the
crowd
of
spectators
many
parents
would
recognize
their
children
in
the
marching
figures
of
the
procession
and
girls
and
boys
would
point
out
their
brothers
and
sisters
and
eagerly
call
out
their
names
but
in
the
stolid
faces
of
the
initiates
not
an
eye
would
gleam
with
recognition
not
a
muscle
would
twitch
with
an
involuntary
expression
of
delight
for
having
just
been
raised
from
the
dead
they
were
supposed
to
know
nothing
of
their
former
life
of
friends
and
relations
of
home
and
country
there
might
be
in
the
crowd
a
mother
or
a
sister
not
seen
for
years
or
more
moving
still
the
novice
might
look
in
vain
for
loved
and
remembered
faces
that
would
never
be
seen
in
the
again
but
whatever
his
feelings
might
be
he
must
rigidly
suppress
them
under
pain
of
a
flogging
a
fine
or
even
death
at
last
the
parade
was
over
and
the
procession
broke
up
then
the
old
hands
introduced
the
new
hands
to
their
own
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
to
their
old
homes
and
haunts
for
still
the
novices
kept
up
the
pretence
that
everything
was
new
and
strange
to
them
that
they
could
not
speak
their
mother
tongue
that
they
did
not
know
their
own
fathers
and
mothers
their
own
town
and
their
own
houses
nay
that
they
had
forgotten
even
how
to
eat
their
food
so
everything
and
everybody
had
to
be
shewn
to
them
and
their
names
and
meanings
explained
their
guides
would
lead
them
about
the
town
pointing
out
the
various
roads
and
telling
where
they
led
one
to
the
on
the
river
this
to
the
forest
that
to
the
farms
and
so
on
they
would
take
up
the
commonest
domestic
utensils
and
shew
what
they
were
used
for
they
would
even
chew
the
food
and
put
it
into
the
mouths
of
the
novices
like
mother
birds
feeding
their
callow
young
for
some
time
afterwards
the
resuscitated
persons
attended
by
their
mentors
would
go
about
the
town
and
the
neighbourhood
acting
in
a
strange
way
like
children
or
mad
folk
seizing
what
they
wanted
and
trying
to
beat
or
even
kill
such
as
dared
to
refuse
them
anything
their
guardian
would
generally
restrain
these
sallies
but
sometimes
he
would
arrange
with
his
hopeful
pupils
to
be
out
of
sight
when
two
or
three
of
them
clubbed
together
to
assault
and
rob
an
honest
man
and
would
only
return
in
time
to
share
the
booty
after
a
while
however
the
excitement
created
by
the
resurrection
would
wear
off
the
dead
folk
come
to
life
were
expected
to
have
learned
their
lessons
and
if
they
forgot
themselves
their
memory
was
promptly
refreshed
by
the
law
the
following
account
of
the
rites
as
practised
in
this
part
of
africa
was
given
to
adolf
bastian
by
an
interpreter
the
great
fetish
lives
in
the
interior
of
the
where
nobody
sees
him
and
nobody
can
see
him
when
he
dies
the
fetish
priests
carefully
collect
his
bones
in
order
to
bring
them
to
life
again
and
they
nourish
them
that
he
may
be
clothed
anew
in
flesh
and
blood
but
it
is
not
good
to
speak
of
it
in
the
land
of
ambamba
every
one
must
die
once
and
when
the
fetish
priest
shakes
his
calabash
against
a
village
all
the
men
and
lads
whose
hour
is
come
fall
into
a
state
of
lifeless
torpidity
from
which
they
generally
arise
after
three
days
but
if
the
fetish
loves
a
man
he
carries
him
away
into
the
bush
and
buries
him
in
the
fetish
house
often
for
many
years
when
he
comes
to
life
again
he
begins
to
eat
and
drink
as
before
but
his
understanding
is
gone
and
the
fetish
man
must
teach
him
and
direct
him
in
every
motion
like
the
smallest
child
at
first
this
can
only
be
done
with
a
stick
but
gradually
his
senses
return
so
that
it
is
possible
to
talk
with
him
and
when
his
education
is
complete
the
priest
brings
him
back
to
his
parents
they
would
seldom
recognize
their
son
but
for
the
express
assurances
of
the
fetish
priest
who
moreover
recalls
previous
events
to
their
memory
he
who
has
not
gone
through
the
ceremony
of
the
new
birth
in
ambamba
is
universally
looked
down
upon
and
is
not
admitted
to
the
in
the
same
part
of
africa
we
hear
of
a
fetish
called
malassi
the
votaries
of
which
form
a
secret
order
of
the
usual
sort
with
a
variety
of
ranks
to
which
the
initiates
are
promoted
the
candidate
is
plunged
into
a
magic
sleep
within
the
and
while
he
sleeps
he
beholds
a
bird
or
other
object
with
which
his
existence
is
henceforth
sympathetically
bound
up
just
as
the
life
of
the
young
indian
is
bound
up
with
the
animal
which
he
sees
in
his
dream
at
puberty
all
who
have
been
born
again
at
initiation
after
their
return
to
a
normal
state
bear
the
name
of
swamie
a
sacred
designation
also
in
india
or
if
they
are
women
sumbo
tembo
and
wear
as
a
token
the
ring
called
which
consists
of
an
iron
hoop
with
a
fruit
attached
to
similarly
among
the
fans
of
the
gaboon
a
young
warrior
acquires
his
guardian
spirit
by
dreaming
he
is
secluded
in
the
forest
drinks
a
fermented
and
intoxicating
liquor
and
smokes
hemp
then
he
falls
into
a
heavy
sleep
and
next
morning
he
must
describe
exactly
to
the
fetish
priest
the
animal
tree
mineral
or
whatever
it
may
have
been
which
he
saw
in
his
dream
this
magical
dream
is
repeated
on
three
successive
nights
and
after
that
the
young
man
is
sent
forth
by
the
priest
to
seek
and
bring
back
the
beast
bird
reptile
or
whatever
it
was
of
which
he
dreamed
the
youth
obeys
reduces
the
animal
or
thing
to
cinders
or
ashes
and
preserves
these
calcined
remains
as
a
talisman
which
will
protect
him
against
many
dangers
however
in
these
rites
there
is
no
clear
simulation
of
dying
and
coming
to
life
again
rites
of
death
and
resurrection
were
formerly
observed
in
quoja
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
to
the
north
of
the
congo
they
are
thus
described
by
an
old
writer
they
have
another
ceremony
which
they
call
but
it
is
not
for
everybody
for
it
is
an
incorporation
in
the
assembly
of
the
spirits
and
confers
the
right
of
entering
their
groves
that
is
to
say
of
going
and
eating
the
offerings
which
the
simple
folk
bring
thither
the
initiation
or
admission
to
the
is
celebrated
every
twenty
or
years
the
initiated
recount
marvels
of
the
ceremony
saying
that
they
are
roasted
that
they
entirely
change
their
habits
and
life
and
that
they
receive
a
spirit
quite
different
from
that
of
other
people
and
quite
new
lights
the
badge
of
membership
consists
in
some
lines
traced
on
the
neck
between
the
shoulders
the
lines
seem
to
be
pricked
with
a
needle
those
who
have
this
mark
pass
for
persons
of
spirit
and
when
they
have
attained
a
certain
age
they
are
allowed
a
voice
in
all
public
assemblies
whereas
the
uninitiated
are
regarded
as
profane
impure
and
ignorant
persons
who
dare
not
express
an
opinion
on
any
subject
of
importance
when
the
time
for
the
ceremony
has
come
it
is
celebrated
as
follows
by
order
of
the
king
a
place
is
appointed
in
the
forest
whither
they
bring
the
youths
who
have
not
been
marked
not
without
much
crying
and
weeping
for
it
is
impressed
upon
the
youths
that
in
order
to
undergo
this
change
it
is
necessary
to
suffer
death
so
they
dispose
of
their
property
as
if
it
were
all
over
with
them
there
are
always
some
of
the
initiated
beside
the
novices
to
instruct
them
they
teach
them
to
dance
a
certain
dance
called
and
to
sing
verses
in
praise
of
belli
above
all
they
are
very
careful
not
to
let
them
die
of
hunger
because
if
they
did
so
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
the
spiritual
resurrection
would
profit
them
nothing
this
manner
of
life
lasts
five
or
six
years
and
is
comfortable
enough
for
there
is
a
village
in
the
forest
and
they
amuse
themselves
with
hunting
and
fishing
other
lads
are
brought
thither
from
time
to
time
so
that
the
last
comers
have
not
long
to
stay
no
woman
or
uninitiated
person
is
suffered
to
pass
within
four
or
five
leagues
of
the
sacred
wood
when
their
instruction
is
completed
they
are
taken
from
the
wood
and
shut
up
in
small
huts
made
for
the
purpose
here
they
begin
once
more
to
hold
communion
with
mankind
and
to
talk
with
the
women
who
bring
them
their
food
it
is
amusing
to
see
their
affected
simplicity
they
pretend
to
know
no
one
and
to
be
ignorant
of
all
the
customs
of
the
country
such
as
the
customs
of
washing
themselves
rubbing
themselves
with
oil
and
so
forth
when
they
enter
these
huts
their
bodies
are
all
covered
with
the
feathers
of
birds
and
they
wear
caps
of
bark
which
hang
down
before
their
faces
but
after
a
time
they
are
dressed
in
clothes
and
taken
to
a
great
open
place
where
all
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
are
assembled
here
the
novices
give
the
first
proof
of
their
capacity
by
dancing
a
dance
which
is
called
the
dance
of
belli
after
the
dance
is
over
the
novices
are
taken
to
the
houses
of
their
parents
by
their
miss
kingsley
informs
us
that
the
great
point
of
agreement
between
all
these
west
african
secret
societies
lies
in
the
methods
of
initiation
the
boy
if
he
belongs
to
a
tribe
that
goes
in
for
tattooing
is
tattooed
and
is
handed
over
to
instructors
in
the
societies
secrets
and
formulae
he
lives
with
the
other
boys
of
his
tribe
undergoing
initiation
usually
under
the
rule
of
several
instructors
and
for
the
space
of
one
year
he
lives
always
in
the
forest
and
is
naked
and
smeared
with
clay
the
boys
are
exercised
so
as
to
become
inured
to
hardship
in
some
districts
they
make
raids
so
as
to
perfect
themselves
in
this
useful
accomplishment
they
always
take
a
new
name
and
are
supposed
by
the
initiation
process
to
become
new
beings
in
the
magic
wood
and
on
their
return
to
their
village
at
the
end
of
their
course
they
pretend
to
have
entirely
forgotten
their
life
before
they
entered
the
wood
but
this
pretence
is
not
kept
up
beyond
the
period
of
festivities
given
to
welcome
them
home
they
all
learn
to
a
certain
extent
a
new
language
a
secret
language
only
understood
by
the
initiated
the
same
removal
from
home
and
instruction
from
initiated
members
is
observed
also
with
the
girls
however
in
their
case
it
is
not
always
a
they
are
secluded
in
sometimes
it
is
done
in
huts
among
the
grain
coast
tribes
however
the
girls
go
into
a
magic
wood
until
they
are
married
should
they
have
to
leave
the
wood
for
any
temporary
reason
they
must
smear
themselves
with
white
clay
a
similar
custom
holds
good
in
okÿon
calabar
district
where
should
a
girl
have
to
leave
the
she
must
be
covered
with
white
among
the
natives
of
the
sherbro
an
island
lying
close
to
the
coast
of
sierra
leone
there
is
a
secret
society
called
the
or
which
is
partly
of
a
religious
but
chiefly
of
a
political
nature
it
resembles
in
excluding
females
and
in
obliging
every
member
by
a
solemn
oath
which
i
believe
is
seldom
violated
not
to
divulge
the
sacred
mysteries
and
to
yield
a
prompt
and
implicit
obedience
to
every
order
of
their
superiors
boys
of
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
are
admitted
or
rather
serve
a
novitiate
until
they
arrive
at
a
proper
age
for
it
is
difficult
to
procure
exact
information
and
even
somewhat
dangerous
to
make
many
inquiries
every
person
on
entering
the
society
lays
aside
his
former
name
and
assumes
a
new
one
to
call
him
by
his
old
name
would
produce
a
dispute
they
have
a
superior
or
head
man
assisted
by
a
grand
council
whose
commands
are
received
with
the
most
profound
reverence
and
absolute
submission
both
by
the
subordinate
councils
and
by
individuals
their
meetings
are
held
in
the
most
retired
spots
amid
the
gloom
of
night
and
carried
on
with
inquisitorial
secrecy
when
the
comes
into
a
town
which
is
always
at
night
it
is
accompanied
with
the
most
dreadful
howlings
screams
and
other
horrid
noises
the
inhabitants
who
are
not
members
of
the
society
are
obliged
to
secure
themselves
within
doors
should
any
one
be
discovered
without
or
attempting
to
peep
at
what
is
going
forward
he
would
inevitably
be
put
to
death
to
restrain
the
curiosity
of
the
females
they
are
ordered
to
continue
within
doors
clapping
their
hands
incessantly
so
long
as
the
remains
like
the
secret
tribunal
which
formerly
existed
in
germany
it
takes
cognizance
of
offences
particularly
of
witchcraft
and
murder
but
above
all
of
contumacy
and
disobedience
in
any
of
its
own
members
and
punishes
the
guilty
with
death
in
so
secret
and
sudden
a
manner
that
the
perpetrators
are
never
known
indeed
such
is
the
dread
created
by
this
institution
that
they
are
never
even
inquired
when
the
members
of
the
or
society
visit
a
town
the
leader
of
the
troop
whom
an
english
writer
calls
the
poro
devil
draws
discordant
notes
from
a
sort
of
reed
flute
the
holes
of
which
are
covered
with
spiders
webs
the
only
time
when
this
devil
and
his
rout
make
a
prolonged
stay
in
the
town
is
on
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
the
newly
initiated
lads
are
to
be
brought
back
from
the
forest
then
the
leader
and
his
satellites
parade
the
streets
for
hours
while
all
the
uninitiated
men
women
and
children
remain
shut
up
in
their
houses
listening
to
the
doleful
strains
of
the
flute
which
signify
that
the
devil
is
suffering
the
pangs
of
childbirth
before
he
brings
forth
the
initiated
lads
for
he
is
supposed
to
have
been
pregnant
with
them
the
whole
of
the
rainy
season
ever
since
they
entered
into
the
forest
when
they
come
forth
from
the
wood
they
wear
four
or
five
coils
of
twisted
ferns
round
their
waists
in
token
of
their
being
initiated
members
of
the
order
among
the
soosoos
of
senegambia
there
is
a
similar
secret
society
called
the
natives
who
speak
english
call
it
african
masonry
as
the
whole
ceremonies
are
kept
very
private
it
is
difficult
to
discover
in
what
they
consist
but
it
is
said
that
the
novices
are
met
in
the
woods
by
the
old
men
who
cut
marks
on
several
parts
of
their
bodies
but
most
commonly
on
the
belly
they
are
also
taught
a
language
peculiar
to
the
and
swear
dreadful
oaths
never
to
divulge
the
secrets
revealed
to
them
the
young
men
are
then
made
to
live
in
the
woods
for
twelve
months
and
are
supposed
to
be
at
liberty
to
kill
any
one
who
approaches
and
does
not
understand
the
language
of
the
it
is
said
when
women
are
so
unfortunate
as
to
intrude
upon
the
they
kill
them
cut
off
their
breasts
and
hang
them
up
by
the
side
of
the
paths
as
a
warning
to
others
this
circumstance
is
perhaps
less
deserving
of
credit
because
the
soosoos
are
fond
of
telling
wonderful
and
horrid
stories
respecting
this
institution
they
say
for
instance
that
when
first
initiated
their
throats
are
cut
and
they
continue
dead
for
some
time
at
length
they
are
reanimated
and
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
institution
and
are
enabled
to
ramble
about
with
much
more
vigour
than
they
possessed
while
the
belief
or
the
pretence
of
death
and
resurrection
at
initiation
is
common
among
the
negroes
of
west
africa
few
traces
of
it
appear
to
be
found
among
the
tribes
in
the
southern
central
and
eastern
parts
of
that
continent
and
it
is
notable
that
in
these
regions
secret
societies
which
flourish
in
the
west
are
also
conspicuously
absent
however
the
akikuyu
of
british
east
africa
have
a
curious
custom
which
requires
that
every
boy
just
before
circumcision
must
be
born
again
the
mother
stands
up
with
the
boy
crouching
at
her
feet
she
pretends
to
go
through
all
the
labour
pains
and
the
boy
on
being
reborn
cries
like
a
babe
and
is
washed
he
lives
on
milk
for
some
days
a
fuller
description
of
the
ceremony
was
given
by
a
member
of
the
kikuyu
tribe
as
follows
a
day
is
appointed
any
time
of
year
by
father
and
mother
if
the
father
is
dead
another
elder
is
called
in
to
act
as
proxy
in
his
stead
or
if
the
mother
is
not
living
another
woman
to
act
in
her
place
any
woman
thus
acting
as
representative
is
looked
upon
in
future
by
the
boy
as
his
own
mother
a
goat
or
sheep
is
killed
in
the
afternoon
by
any
one
usually
not
by
the
father
and
the
stomach
and
intestines
reserved
the
ceremony
begins
in
the
evening
a
piece
of
skin
is
cut
in
a
circle
and
passed
over
one
shoulder
of
the
candidate
and
under
the
other
arm
the
stomach
of
the
goat
is
similarly
treated
and
passed
over
the
other
shoulder
and
under
the
other
arm
all
the
boy
s
ornaments
are
removed
but
not
his
clothes
no
men
are
allowed
inside
the
hut
but
women
are
present
the
mother
sits
on
a
hide
on
the
floor
with
the
boy
between
her
knees
the
sheep
s
gut
is
passed
round
the
woman
and
brought
in
front
of
the
boy
the
woman
groans
as
in
labour
another
woman
cuts
the
gut
and
the
boy
imitates
the
cry
of
a
infant
the
women
present
all
applaud
and
afterwards
the
assistant
and
the
mother
wash
the
boy
that
night
the
boy
sleeps
in
the
same
hut
as
the
here
the
cutting
of
the
sheep
s
gut
which
unites
the
mother
to
the
boy
is
clearly
an
imitation
of
severing
the
navel
string
nor
is
it
boys
alone
who
are
born
again
among
the
akikuyu
girls
go
through
the
rite
of
second
birth
as
well
as
boys
it
is
sometimes
administered
to
infants
at
one
time
the
new
birth
was
combined
with
circumcision
and
so
the
ceremony
admitted
to
the
privileges
and
religious
rites
of
the
tribe
afterwards
trouble
took
place
on
account
of
mere
boys
wishing
to
take
their
place
alongside
of
the
young
men
and
maintaining
they
were
justified
in
doing
so
the
old
men
then
settled
the
matter
by
separating
the
two
unless
the
new
birth
has
been
administered
the
individual
is
not
in
a
position
to
be
admitted
to
circumcision
which
is
the
outward
sign
of
admittance
to
the
nation
any
who
have
not
gone
through
the
rite
can
not
inherit
property
nor
take
any
part
in
the
religious
rites
of
the
for
example
a
man
who
has
not
been
born
again
is
disqualified
for
carrying
his
dying
father
out
into
the
wilds
and
for
disposing
of
his
body
after
death
the
new
birth
seems
to
take
place
usually
about
the
tenth
year
but
the
age
varies
with
the
ability
of
the
father
to
provide
a
goat
whose
guts
are
necessary
to
enable
the
boy
or
girl
to
be
born
again
in
due
form
among
the
bondeis
a
tribe
on
the
coast
of
german
east
africa
opposite
to
the
island
of
pemba
one
of
the
rites
of
initiation
into
manhood
consists
in
a
pretence
of
slaying
one
of
the
lads
with
a
sword
the
entrails
of
a
fowl
are
placed
on
the
boy
s
stomach
to
make
the
pretence
seem
more
real
among
the
bushongo
who
inhabit
a
district
of
the
belgian
congo
bounded
on
the
north
and
east
by
the
sankuru
river
and
on
the
west
by
the
kasai
young
boys
had
formerly
to
undergo
certain
rites
of
initiation
amongst
which
a
simulation
of
killing
them
would
seem
to
have
had
a
place
though
in
recent
times
the
youths
have
been
allowed
to
escape
the
ordeal
by
the
payment
of
a
fine
the
supreme
chief
of
the
tribe
who
in
old
days
bore
the
title
of
god
on
earth
used
to
assemble
all
the
lads
who
had
just
reached
puberty
and
send
them
away
into
the
forest
where
they
remained
for
several
months
under
the
care
of
one
of
his
sons
during
their
seclusion
they
were
deemed
unclean
and
might
see
no
one
if
they
chanced
to
meet
a
woman
she
had
to
flee
before
them
by
night
the
old
men
marched
round
the
quarters
of
the
novices
raising
hideous
cries
and
whirling
the
noise
of
which
the
frightened
lads
took
to
be
the
voices
of
ghosts
they
wore
nothing
but
a
comb
and
passed
their
leisure
hours
in
learning
to
make
mats
and
baskets
after
about
a
month
they
had
to
submit
to
the
first
ordeal
a
trench
about
ten
feet
deep
was
dug
in
the
ground
and
roofed
over
with
sticks
and
earth
so
as
to
form
a
dark
tunnel
in
the
sides
of
the
tunnel
were
cut
niches
and
in
each
niche
a
man
took
post
whose
business
it
was
to
terrify
the
novices
for
this
purpose
one
of
them
was
disguised
in
the
skin
of
a
leopard
a
second
was
dressed
as
a
warrior
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
a
third
was
a
smith
with
his
furnace
and
irons
and
a
fourth
was
masked
to
look
like
an
ugly
ape
while
he
too
gripped
a
knife
in
his
hand
the
novices
generally
recoiled
in
dismay
from
each
of
these
apparitions
and
it
was
only
by
means
of
reiterated
taunts
and
threats
that
the
elders
forced
them
to
traverse
the
whole
length
of
the
tunnel
after
the
lapse
of
another
month
the
youths
had
to
face
another
ordeal
of
a
similar
character
a
low
tunnel
about
three
feet
deep
was
dug
in
the
earth
and
sticks
were
inserted
in
it
so
that
their
tops
projected
from
the
surface
of
the
ground
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
a
calabash
was
set
full
of
goat
s
blood
by
way
of
encouraging
the
timid
novices
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
himself
crawled
through
the
tunnel
his
progress
under
ground
being
revealed
to
the
novices
above
ground
by
the
vibrations
of
the
sticks
with
which
he
collided
in
the
dark
passage
then
having
bedabbled
his
nose
his
mouth
and
all
the
rest
of
his
body
with
the
goat
s
blood
he
emerged
from
the
tunnel
on
hands
and
knees
dripping
with
gore
and
to
all
appearance
in
the
last
stage
of
exhaustion
then
he
lay
prostrate
on
his
stomach
in
a
state
of
collapse
the
elders
declared
him
to
be
dead
and
carried
him
off
the
chief
now
ordered
the
lads
to
imitate
the
example
set
them
by
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
but
they
begged
and
prayed
to
be
excused
at
first
the
chief
was
inexorable
but
in
time
he
relented
and
agreed
to
accept
a
fine
of
so
many
cowries
as
a
ransom
paid
by
the
youths
for
exemption
from
the
ordeal
a
month
later
the
last
of
the
ordeals
took
place
a
great
trunk
of
a
tree
was
buried
with
its
lower
end
in
the
earth
and
surrounded
for
of
its
circumference
with
arrows
stuck
in
the
ground
so
that
the
barbs
were
pointed
towards
the
tree
the
chief
and
the
leading
men
sat
down
at
the
gap
in
the
circle
of
arrows
so
as
to
conceal
the
gap
from
the
eyes
of
the
novices
and
other
spectators
among
whom
the
women
were
allowed
to
be
present
to
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
it
now
seemed
that
the
tree
was
surrounded
by
a
bristling
hedge
of
arrows
to
fall
upon
which
would
be
death
all
being
ready
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
climbed
the
tree
amid
breathless
silence
and
having
reached
the
top
which
was
decorated
with
a
bunch
of
leaves
he
looked
about
him
and
asked
the
women
shall
i
come
down
no
no
they
shrieked
you
will
be
killed
by
the
then
turning
disdainfully
from
these
craven
souls
the
gallant
man
addressed
himself
to
the
youths
and
repeated
his
question
shall
i
come
down
a
shout
of
yes
gave
the
answer
that
might
have
been
expected
from
these
heroic
spirits
in
response
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
at
once
slid
down
the
tree
and
dropping
neatly
to
the
ground
just
at
the
gap
in
the
hedge
of
arrows
presented
himself
unscathed
to
the
gaze
of
the
excited
assembly
the
chief
now
ordered
the
young
men
to
go
up
and
do
likewise
but
the
dauntless
courage
with
which
they
had
contemplated
the
descent
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
entirely
forsook
them
when
it
came
to
their
turn
to
copy
his
shining
example
their
mothers
too
raised
a
loud
cry
of
protest
joining
their
prayers
and
entreaties
to
those
of
their
hopeful
sons
after
some
discussion
the
chief
consented
to
accept
a
ransom
and
the
novices
were
dispensed
from
the
ordeal
then
they
bathed
and
were
deemed
to
have
rid
themselves
of
their
uncleanness
but
they
had
still
to
work
for
the
chief
for
three
months
before
they
ranked
as
men
and
might
return
to
their
villages
among
the
indians
of
virginia
an
initiatory
ceremony
called
took
place
every
sixteen
or
twenty
years
or
oftener
as
the
young
men
happened
to
grow
up
the
youths
were
kept
in
solitary
confinement
in
the
woods
for
several
months
receiving
no
food
but
an
infusion
of
some
intoxicating
roots
so
that
they
went
raving
mad
and
continued
in
this
state
eighteen
or
twenty
days
upon
this
occasion
it
is
pretended
that
these
poor
creatures
drink
so
much
of
the
water
of
lethe
that
they
perfectly
lose
the
remembrance
of
all
former
things
even
of
their
parents
their
treasure
and
their
language
when
the
doctors
find
that
they
have
drunk
sufficiently
of
the
wysoccan
so
they
call
this
mad
potion
they
gradually
restore
them
to
their
senses
again
by
lessening
the
intoxication
of
their
diet
but
before
they
are
perfectly
well
they
bring
them
back
into
their
towns
while
they
are
still
wild
and
crazy
through
the
violence
of
the
medicine
after
this
they
are
very
fearful
of
discovering
anything
of
their
former
remembrance
for
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
to
any
of
them
they
must
immediately
be
again
and
the
second
time
the
usage
is
so
severe
that
seldom
any
one
escapes
with
life
thus
they
must
pretend
to
have
forgot
the
very
use
of
their
tongues
so
as
not
to
be
able
to
speak
nor
understand
anything
that
is
spoken
till
they
learn
it
again
now
whether
this
be
real
or
counterfeit
i
don
t
know
but
certain
it
is
that
they
will
not
for
some
time
take
notice
of
anybody
nor
anything
with
which
they
were
before
acquainted
being
still
under
the
guard
of
their
keepers
who
constantly
wait
upon
them
everywhere
till
they
have
learnt
all
things
perfectly
over
again
thus
they
unlive
their
former
lives
and
commence
men
by
forgetting
that
they
ever
have
been
among
some
of
the
indian
tribes
of
north
america
there
exist
certain
religious
associations
which
are
only
open
to
candidates
who
have
gone
through
a
pretence
of
being
killed
and
brought
to
life
again
in
or
captain
jonathan
carver
witnessed
the
admission
of
a
candidate
to
an
association
called
the
friendly
society
of
the
spirit
among
the
naudowessies
a
siouan
or
dacotan
tribe
in
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
the
candidate
knelt
before
the
chief
who
told
him
that
he
himself
was
now
agitated
by
the
same
spirit
which
he
should
in
a
few
moments
communicate
to
him
that
it
would
strike
him
dead
but
that
he
would
instantly
be
restored
again
to
life
to
this
he
added
that
the
communication
however
terrifying
was
a
necessary
introduction
to
the
advantages
enjoyed
by
the
community
into
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
being
admitted
as
he
spoke
this
he
appeared
to
be
greatly
agitated
till
at
last
his
emotions
became
so
violent
that
his
countenance
was
distorted
and
his
whole
frame
convulsed
at
this
juncture
he
threw
something
that
appeared
both
in
shape
and
colour
like
a
small
bean
at
the
young
man
which
seemed
to
enter
his
mouth
and
he
instantly
fell
as
motionless
as
if
he
had
been
for
a
time
the
man
lay
like
dead
but
under
a
shower
of
blows
he
shewed
signs
of
consciousness
and
finally
discharging
from
his
mouth
the
bean
or
whatever
it
was
that
the
chief
had
thrown
at
him
he
came
to
life
in
other
tribes
for
example
the
ojebways
winnebagoes
and
dacotas
or
sioux
the
instrument
by
which
the
candidate
is
apparently
slain
is
the
the
bag
is
made
of
the
skin
of
an
animal
such
as
the
otter
wild
cat
serpent
bear
raccoon
wolf
owl
weasel
of
which
it
roughly
preserves
the
shape
each
member
of
the
society
has
one
of
these
bags
in
which
he
keeps
the
odds
and
ends
that
make
up
his
medicine
or
charms
they
believe
that
from
the
miscellaneous
contents
in
the
belly
of
the
skin
bag
or
animal
there
issues
a
spirit
or
breath
which
has
the
power
not
only
to
knock
down
and
kill
a
man
but
also
to
set
him
up
and
restore
him
to
the
mode
of
killing
a
man
with
one
of
these
is
to
thrust
it
at
him
he
falls
like
dead
but
a
second
thrust
of
the
bag
restores
him
to
life
among
the
dacotas
the
institution
of
the
or
was
attributed
to
onktehi
the
great
spirit
of
the
waters
who
ordained
that
the
bag
should
consist
of
the
skin
of
the
otter
raccoon
weasel
squirrel
or
loon
or
a
species
of
fish
and
of
serpents
further
he
decreed
that
the
bag
should
contain
four
sorts
of
medicines
of
magical
qualities
which
should
represent
fowls
quadrupeds
herbs
and
trees
accordingly
swan
s
down
buffalo
hair
grass
roots
and
bark
from
the
roots
of
trees
are
kept
by
the
dacotas
in
their
from
this
combination
there
proceeds
a
magical
influence
so
powerful
that
no
human
being
can
of
his
own
strength
withstand
it
when
the
god
of
the
waters
had
prepared
the
first
he
tested
its
powers
on
four
candidates
for
initiation
who
all
perished
under
the
shock
so
he
consulted
with
his
wife
the
goddess
of
the
earth
and
by
holding
up
his
left
hand
and
pattering
on
the
back
of
it
with
the
right
he
produced
myriads
of
little
shells
whose
virtue
is
to
restore
life
to
those
who
have
been
slain
by
the
having
taken
this
precaution
the
god
chose
four
other
candidates
and
repeated
the
experiment
of
initiation
with
success
for
after
killing
them
with
the
bag
he
immediately
resuscitated
them
by
throwing
one
of
the
shells
into
their
vital
parts
while
he
chanted
certain
words
assuring
them
that
it
was
only
sport
and
bidding
them
rise
to
their
feet
that
is
why
to
this
day
every
initiated
dacota
has
one
of
these
shells
in
his
body
such
was
the
divine
origin
of
the
of
the
dacotas
the
initiation
takes
place
in
a
special
tent
the
candidate
after
being
steamed
in
a
for
four
successive
days
plants
himself
on
a
pile
of
blankets
and
behind
him
stands
an
aged
member
of
the
order
now
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
with
the
joints
of
his
knees
and
hips
considerably
bent
advances
with
an
unsteady
uncouth
hitching
sack
in
hand
wearing
an
aspect
of
desperate
energy
and
uttering
his
heen
heen
heen
with
frightful
emphasis
while
all
around
are
enthusiastic
demonstrations
of
all
kinds
of
wild
passions
at
this
point
the
sack
is
raised
near
a
painted
spot
on
the
breast
of
the
candidate
at
which
the
is
discharged
at
the
instant
the
brother
from
behind
gives
him
a
push
and
he
falls
dead
and
is
covered
with
blankets
now
the
frenzied
dancers
gather
around
and
in
the
midst
of
bewildering
and
indescribable
noises
chant
the
words
uttered
by
the
god
at
the
institution
of
the
ceremony
as
already
recorded
then
the
master
throws
off
the
covering
and
chewing
a
piece
of
the
bone
of
the
onktehi
spirts
it
over
him
and
he
begins
to
show
signs
of
returning
life
then
as
the
master
pats
energetically
upon
the
breast
of
the
initiated
person
he
convulsed
strangling
struggling
and
agonizing
heaves
up
the
shell
which
falls
from
his
mouth
on
a
sack
placed
in
readiness
to
receive
it
life
is
restored
and
entrance
effected
into
the
awful
mysteries
he
belongs
henceforth
to
the
and
has
a
right
to
enjoy
the
a
ceremony
witnessed
by
the
castaway
john
jewitt
during
his
captivity
among
the
indians
of
nootka
sound
doubtless
belongs
to
this
class
of
customs
the
indian
king
or
chief
discharged
a
pistol
close
to
his
son
s
ear
who
immediately
fell
down
as
if
killed
upon
which
all
the
women
of
the
house
set
up
a
most
lamentable
cry
tearing
handfuls
of
hair
from
their
heads
and
exclaiming
that
the
prince
was
dead
at
the
same
time
a
great
number
of
the
inhabitants
rushed
into
the
house
armed
with
their
daggers
muskets
enquiring
the
cause
of
their
outcry
these
were
immediately
followed
by
two
others
dressed
in
wolf
skins
with
masks
over
their
faces
representing
the
head
of
that
animal
the
latter
came
in
on
their
hands
and
feet
in
the
manner
of
a
beast
and
taking
up
the
prince
carried
him
off
upon
their
backs
retiring
in
the
same
manner
they
in
another
place
jewitt
mentions
that
the
young
lad
of
about
eleven
years
of
a
mask
in
imitation
of
a
wolf
s
head
now
as
the
indians
of
this
part
of
america
are
divided
into
totem
clans
of
which
the
wolf
clan
is
one
of
the
principal
and
as
the
members
of
each
clan
are
in
the
habit
of
wearing
some
portion
of
the
totem
animal
about
their
person
it
is
probable
that
the
prince
belonged
to
the
wolf
clan
and
that
the
ceremony
described
by
jewitt
represented
the
killing
of
the
lad
in
order
that
he
might
be
born
anew
as
a
wolf
much
in
the
same
way
that
the
basque
hunter
supposed
himself
to
have
been
killed
and
to
have
come
to
life
again
as
a
bear
this
conjectural
explanation
of
the
ceremony
has
since
it
was
first
put
forward
been
confirmed
by
the
researches
of
franz
boas
among
these
indians
though
it
would
seem
that
the
community
to
which
the
chief
s
son
thus
obtained
admission
was
not
so
much
a
totem
clan
as
a
secret
society
called
tlokoala
whose
members
imitated
wolves
the
name
tlokoala
is
a
foreign
word
among
the
nootka
indians
having
been
borrowed
by
them
from
the
kwakiutl
indians
in
whose
language
the
word
means
the
finding
of
a
or
personal
totem
the
nootka
tradition
runs
that
this
secret
society
was
instituted
by
wolves
who
took
away
a
chief
s
son
and
tried
to
kill
him
but
failing
to
do
so
became
his
friends
taught
him
the
rites
of
the
society
and
ordered
him
to
teach
them
to
his
friends
on
his
return
home
then
they
carried
the
young
man
back
to
his
village
they
also
begged
that
whenever
he
moved
from
one
place
to
another
he
would
kindly
leave
behind
him
some
red
to
be
used
by
them
in
their
own
ceremonies
and
to
this
custom
the
nootka
tribes
still
adhere
every
new
member
of
the
society
must
be
initiated
by
the
wolves
at
night
a
pack
of
wolves
personated
by
indians
dressed
in
and
wearing
make
their
appearance
seize
the
novice
and
carry
him
into
the
woods
when
the
wolves
are
heard
outside
the
village
coming
to
fetch
away
the
novice
all
the
members
of
the
society
blacken
their
faces
and
sing
among
all
the
tribes
is
great
excitement
because
i
am
next
day
the
wolves
bring
back
the
novice
dead
and
the
members
of
the
society
have
to
revive
him
the
wolves
are
supposed
to
have
put
a
magic
stone
into
his
body
which
must
be
removed
before
he
can
come
to
life
till
this
is
done
the
pretended
corpse
is
left
lying
outside
the
house
two
wizards
go
and
remove
the
stone
which
appears
to
be
quartz
and
then
the
novice
is
resuscitated
among
the
niska
indians
of
british
columbia
who
are
divided
into
four
principal
clans
with
the
raven
the
wolf
the
eagle
and
the
bear
for
their
respective
totems
the
novice
at
initiation
is
always
brought
back
by
an
artificial
totem
animal
thus
when
a
man
was
about
to
be
initiated
into
a
secret
society
called
olala
his
friends
drew
their
knives
and
pretended
to
kill
him
in
reality
they
let
him
slip
away
while
they
cut
off
the
head
of
a
dummy
which
had
been
adroitly
substituted
for
him
then
they
laid
the
decapitated
dummy
down
and
covered
it
over
and
the
women
began
to
mourn
and
wail
his
relations
gave
a
funeral
banquet
and
solemnly
burnt
the
effigy
in
short
they
held
a
regular
funeral
for
a
whole
year
the
novice
remained
absent
and
was
seen
by
none
but
members
of
the
secret
society
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
came
back
alive
carried
by
an
artificial
animal
which
represented
his
totem
in
these
ceremonies
the
essence
of
the
rite
appears
to
be
the
killing
of
the
novice
in
his
character
of
a
man
and
his
restoration
to
life
in
the
form
of
the
animal
which
is
thenceforward
to
be
if
not
his
guardian
spirit
at
least
linked
to
him
in
a
peculiarly
intimate
relation
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
indians
of
guatemala
whose
life
was
bound
up
with
an
animal
were
supposed
to
have
the
power
of
appearing
in
the
shape
of
the
particular
creature
with
which
they
were
thus
sympathetically
united
hence
it
seems
not
unreasonable
to
conjecture
that
in
like
manner
the
indians
of
british
columbia
may
imagine
that
their
life
depends
on
the
life
of
some
one
of
that
species
of
creature
to
which
they
assimilate
themselves
by
their
costume
at
least
if
that
is
not
an
article
of
belief
with
the
columbian
indians
of
the
present
day
it
may
very
well
have
been
so
with
their
ancestors
in
the
past
and
thus
may
have
helped
to
mould
the
rites
and
ceremonies
both
of
the
totem
clans
and
of
the
secret
societies
for
though
these
two
sorts
of
communities
differ
in
respect
of
the
mode
in
which
membership
of
them
is
man
being
born
into
his
totem
clan
but
admitted
into
a
secret
society
later
in
can
hardly
doubt
that
they
are
near
akin
and
have
their
root
in
the
same
mode
of
thought
that
thought
if
i
am
right
is
the
possibility
of
establishing
a
sympathetic
relation
with
an
animal
a
spirit
or
other
mighty
being
with
whom
a
man
deposits
for
his
soul
or
some
part
of
it
and
from
whom
he
receives
in
return
a
gift
of
magical
powers
the
carrier
indians
who
dwell
further
inland
than
the
tribes
we
have
just
been
considering
are
divided
into
four
clans
with
the
grouse
the
beaver
the
toad
and
the
grizzly
bear
for
their
totems
but
in
addition
to
these
clan
totems
the
tribe
recognized
a
considerable
number
of
what
father
morice
calls
honorific
totems
which
could
be
acquired
through
the
performance
of
certain
rites
by
any
person
who
wished
to
improve
his
social
position
each
totem
clan
had
a
certain
number
of
honorific
totems
or
crests
and
these
might
be
assumed
by
any
member
of
the
clan
who
fulfilled
the
required
conditions
but
they
could
not
be
acquired
by
members
of
another
clan
thus
the
grouse
clan
had
for
its
honorific
totems
or
crests
the
owl
the
moose
the
weasel
the
crane
the
wolf
the
full
moon
the
wind
and
so
on
the
toad
clan
had
the
sturgeon
the
porcupine
the
wolverine
the
woodpecker
the
darding
knife
and
so
forth
the
beaver
clan
had
the
for
one
of
its
honorific
totems
and
the
goose
was
a
honorific
totem
of
the
grizzly
bear
clan
but
the
common
bear
as
a
honorific
totem
or
crest
might
be
assumed
by
anybody
whatever
his
clan
the
common
possession
of
a
honorific
totem
appears
to
have
constituted
the
same
sort
of
bond
among
the
carrier
indians
as
the
membership
of
a
secret
society
does
among
the
coast
tribes
of
british
columbia
certainly
the
rites
of
initiation
were
similar
this
will
be
clear
from
father
morice
s
account
of
the
performances
which
i
will
subjoin
in
his
own
words
the
connection
of
the
individual
with
his
crest
appeared
more
especially
during
ceremonial
dances
when
the
former
attired
if
possible
with
the
spoils
of
the
latter
was
wont
to
personate
it
in
the
gaze
of
an
admiring
assemblage
on
all
such
occasions
man
and
totem
were
also
called
by
the
same
name
the
adoption
of
any
such
rite
or
crest
was
usually
accompanied
by
initiatory
ceremonies
or
observances
corresponding
to
the
nature
of
the
crest
followed
in
all
cases
by
a
distribution
of
clothes
to
all
present
thus
whenever
anybody
resolved
upon
getting
received
as
or
bear
he
would
regardless
of
the
season
divest
himself
of
all
his
wearing
apparel
and
don
a
whereupon
he
would
dash
into
the
woods
there
to
remain
for
the
space
of
three
or
four
days
and
nights
in
deference
to
the
wonts
of
his
intended
totem
animal
every
night
a
party
of
his
would
sally
out
in
search
of
the
missing
to
their
loud
calls
come
on
bear
he
would
answer
by
angry
growls
in
imitation
of
the
bear
the
searching
party
making
for
the
spot
where
he
had
been
heard
would
find
by
a
second
call
followed
by
a
similar
answer
that
he
had
dexterously
shifted
to
some
opposite
quarter
in
the
forest
as
a
rule
he
could
not
be
found
but
had
to
come
back
of
himself
when
he
was
speedily
apprehended
and
conducted
to
the
ceremonial
lodge
where
he
would
commence
his
first
in
conjunction
with
all
the
other
totem
people
each
of
whom
would
then
personate
his
own
particular
totem
finally
would
take
place
the
distribution
of
property
of
the
newly
initiated
bear
who
would
not
forget
to
present
his
captor
with
at
least
a
whole
dressed
skin
the
initiation
to
the
darding
knife
was
quite
a
theatrical
performance
a
lance
was
prepared
which
had
a
very
sharp
point
so
arranged
that
the
slightest
pressure
on
its
tip
would
cause
the
steel
to
gradually
sink
into
the
shaft
in
the
sight
of
the
multitude
crowding
the
lodge
this
lance
was
pressed
on
the
bare
chest
of
the
candidate
and
apparently
sunk
in
his
body
to
the
shaft
when
he
would
tumble
down
simulating
death
at
the
same
time
a
quantity
of
kept
in
the
issue
from
the
corpse
making
it
quite
clear
to
the
uninitiated
that
the
terrible
knife
had
had
its
effect
when
lo
upon
one
of
the
actors
striking
up
one
of
the
chants
specially
made
for
the
circumstance
and
richly
paid
for
the
candidate
would
gradually
rise
up
a
new
man
the
particular
of
the
darding
in
the
former
of
these
two
initiatory
rites
of
the
carrier
indians
the
prominent
feature
is
the
transformation
of
the
man
into
his
totem
animal
in
the
latter
it
is
his
death
and
resurrection
but
in
substance
probably
both
are
identical
in
both
the
novice
dies
as
a
man
and
revives
as
his
totem
whether
that
be
a
bear
a
darding
knife
or
what
not
in
other
words
he
has
deposited
his
life
or
some
portion
of
it
in
his
totem
with
which
accordingly
for
the
future
he
is
more
or
less
completely
identified
hard
as
it
may
be
for
us
to
conceive
why
a
man
should
choose
to
identify
himself
with
a
knife
whether
darding
or
otherwise
we
have
to
remember
that
in
celebes
it
is
to
a
or
other
iron
tool
that
the
soul
of
a
woman
in
labour
is
transferred
for
safety
and
the
difference
between
a
and
a
darding
knife
considered
as
a
receptacle
for
a
human
soul
is
perhaps
not
very
material
among
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
warriors
who
had
a
knife
an
arrow
or
any
other
weapon
for
their
personal
totem
or
guardian
spirit
enjoyed
this
signal
advantage
over
their
fellows
that
they
were
for
all
practical
purposes
invulnerable
if
an
arrow
did
hit
them
which
seldom
happened
they
vomited
the
blood
up
and
the
hurt
soon
healed
hence
these
warriors
rarely
wore
armour
which
would
indeed
have
been
superfluous
and
they
generally
took
the
most
dangerous
posts
in
battle
so
convinced
were
the
thompson
indians
of
the
power
of
their
personal
totem
or
guardian
spirit
to
bring
them
back
to
life
that
some
of
them
killed
themselves
in
the
sure
hope
that
the
spirit
would
immediately
raise
them
up
from
the
dead
others
more
prudently
experimented
on
their
friends
shooting
them
dead
and
then
awaiting
more
or
less
cheerfully
their
joyful
resurrection
we
are
not
told
that
success
crowned
these
experimental
demonstrations
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
toukaway
indians
of
texas
one
of
whose
totems
is
the
wolf
have
a
ceremony
in
which
men
dressed
in
run
about
on
all
fours
howling
and
mimicking
wolves
at
last
they
scratch
up
a
living
tribesman
who
has
been
buried
on
purpose
and
putting
a
bow
and
arrows
in
his
hands
bid
him
do
as
the
wolves
kill
and
murder
the
ceremony
probably
forms
part
of
an
initiatory
rite
like
the
resurrection
from
the
grave
of
the
old
man
in
the
australian
rites
the
simulation
of
death
and
resurrection
or
of
a
new
birth
at
initiation
appears
to
have
lingered
on
or
at
least
to
have
left
traces
of
itself
among
peoples
who
have
advanced
far
beyond
the
stage
of
savagery
thus
after
his
investiture
with
the
sacred
symbol
of
his
brahman
is
called
twice
manu
says
according
to
the
injunction
of
the
revealed
texts
the
first
birth
of
an
aryan
is
from
his
natural
mother
the
second
happens
on
the
tying
of
the
girdle
of
muñga
grass
and
the
third
on
the
initiation
to
the
performance
to
a
srauta
a
pretence
of
killing
the
candidate
perhaps
formed
part
of
the
initiation
to
the
mithraic
mysteries
thus
on
the
theory
here
suggested
wherever
totemism
is
found
and
wherever
a
pretence
is
made
of
killing
and
bringing
to
life
again
the
novice
at
initiation
there
may
exist
or
have
existed
not
only
a
belief
in
the
possibility
of
permanently
depositing
the
soul
in
some
external
plant
or
what
an
actual
intention
of
so
doing
if
the
question
is
put
why
do
men
desire
to
deposit
their
life
outside
their
bodies
the
answer
can
only
be
that
like
the
giant
in
the
fairy
tale
they
think
it
safer
to
do
so
than
to
carry
it
about
with
them
just
as
people
deposit
their
money
with
a
banker
rather
than
carry
it
on
their
persons
we
have
seen
that
at
critical
periods
the
life
or
soul
is
sometimes
temporarily
stowed
away
in
a
safe
place
till
the
danger
is
past
but
institutions
like
totemism
are
not
resorted
to
merely
on
special
occasions
of
danger
they
are
systems
into
which
every
one
or
at
least
every
male
is
obliged
to
be
initiated
at
a
certain
period
of
life
now
the
period
of
life
at
which
initiation
takes
place
is
regularly
puberty
and
this
fact
suggests
that
the
special
danger
which
totemism
and
systems
like
it
are
intended
to
obviate
is
supposed
not
to
arise
till
sexual
maturity
has
been
attained
in
fact
that
the
danger
apprehended
is
believed
to
attend
the
relation
of
the
sexes
to
each
other
it
would
be
easy
to
prove
by
a
long
array
of
facts
that
the
sexual
relation
is
associated
in
the
primitive
mind
with
many
serious
perils
but
the
exact
nature
of
the
danger
apprehended
is
still
obscure
we
may
hope
that
a
more
exact
acquaintance
with
savage
modes
of
thought
will
in
time
disclose
this
central
mystery
of
primitive
society
and
will
thereby
furnish
the
clue
not
only
to
totemism
but
to
the
origin
of
the
marriage
system
chapter
xii
the
golden
bough
thus
the
view
that
balder
s
life
was
in
the
mistletoe
is
entirely
in
harmony
with
primitive
modes
of
thought
it
may
indeed
sound
like
a
contradiction
that
if
his
life
was
in
the
mistletoe
he
should
nevertheless
have
been
killed
by
a
blow
from
the
plant
but
when
a
person
s
life
is
conceived
as
embodied
in
a
particular
object
with
the
existence
of
which
his
own
existence
is
inseparably
bound
up
and
the
destruction
of
which
involves
his
own
the
object
in
question
may
be
regarded
and
spoken
of
indifferently
as
his
life
or
his
death
as
happens
in
the
fairy
tales
hence
if
a
man
s
death
is
in
an
object
it
is
perfectly
natural
that
he
should
be
killed
by
a
blow
from
it
in
the
fairy
tales
koshchei
the
deathless
is
killed
by
a
blow
from
the
egg
or
the
stone
in
which
his
life
or
death
is
secreted
the
ogres
burst
when
a
certain
grain
of
containing
their
life
or
carried
over
their
heads
the
magician
dies
when
the
stone
in
which
his
life
or
death
is
contained
is
put
under
his
pillow
and
the
tartar
hero
is
warned
that
he
may
be
killed
by
the
golden
arrow
or
golden
sword
in
which
his
soul
has
been
stowed
away
the
idea
that
the
life
of
the
oak
was
in
the
mistletoe
was
probably
suggested
as
i
have
said
by
the
observation
that
in
winter
the
mistletoe
growing
on
the
oak
remains
green
while
the
oak
itself
is
leafless
but
the
position
of
the
not
from
the
ground
but
from
the
trunk
or
branches
of
the
confirm
this
idea
primitive
man
might
think
that
like
himself
the
had
sought
to
deposit
his
life
in
some
safe
place
and
for
this
purpose
had
pitched
on
the
mistletoe
which
being
in
a
sense
neither
on
earth
nor
in
heaven
might
be
supposed
to
be
fairly
out
of
harm
s
way
in
the
first
chapter
we
saw
that
primitive
man
seeks
to
preserve
the
life
of
his
human
divinities
by
keeping
them
poised
between
earth
and
heaven
as
the
place
where
they
are
least
likely
to
be
assailed
by
the
dangers
that
encompass
the
life
of
man
on
earth
we
can
therefore
understand
why
it
has
been
a
rule
both
of
ancient
and
of
modern
that
the
mistletoe
should
not
be
allowed
to
touch
the
ground
were
it
to
touch
the
ground
its
healing
virtue
would
be
gone
this
may
be
a
survival
of
the
old
superstition
that
the
plant
in
which
the
life
of
the
sacred
tree
was
concentrated
should
not
be
exposed
to
the
risk
incurred
by
contact
with
the
earth
in
an
indian
legend
which
offers
a
parallel
to
the
balder
myth
indra
swore
to
the
demon
namuci
that
he
would
slay
him
neither
by
day
nor
by
night
neither
with
staff
nor
with
bow
neither
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
nor
with
the
fist
neither
with
the
wet
nor
with
the
dry
but
he
killed
him
in
the
morning
twilight
by
sprinkling
over
him
the
foam
of
the
sea
the
foam
of
the
sea
is
just
such
an
object
as
a
savage
might
choose
to
put
his
life
in
because
it
occupies
that
sort
of
intermediate
or
nondescript
position
between
earth
and
sky
or
sea
and
sky
in
which
primitive
man
sees
safety
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
the
foam
of
the
river
should
be
the
totem
of
a
clan
in
india
again
the
view
that
the
mistletoe
owes
its
mystic
character
partly
to
its
not
growing
on
the
ground
is
confirmed
by
a
parallel
superstition
about
the
or
in
jutland
a
rowan
that
is
found
growing
out
of
the
top
of
another
tree
is
esteemed
exceedingly
effective
against
witchcraft
since
it
does
not
grow
on
the
ground
witches
have
no
power
over
it
if
it
is
to
have
its
full
effect
it
must
be
cut
on
ascension
hence
it
is
placed
over
doors
to
prevent
the
ingress
of
witches
in
sweden
and
norway
also
magical
properties
are
ascribed
to
a
that
is
to
a
rowan
which
is
found
growing
not
in
the
ordinary
fashion
on
the
ground
but
on
another
tree
or
on
a
roof
or
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
where
it
has
sprouted
from
seed
scattered
by
birds
they
say
that
a
man
who
is
out
in
the
dark
should
have
a
bit
of
with
him
to
chew
else
he
runs
a
risk
of
being
bewitched
and
of
being
unable
to
stir
from
the
spot
a
norwegian
story
relates
how
once
on
a
time
a
troll
so
bewitched
some
men
who
were
ploughing
in
a
field
that
they
could
not
drive
a
straight
furrow
only
one
of
the
ploughmen
was
able
to
resist
the
enchantment
because
by
good
luck
his
plough
was
made
out
of
a
in
sweden
too
the
is
used
to
make
the
divining
rod
which
discovers
hidden
treasures
this
useful
art
has
nowadays
unfortunately
been
almost
forgotten
but
three
hundred
years
ago
it
was
in
full
bloom
as
we
gather
from
the
following
contemporary
account
if
in
the
woods
or
elsewhere
on
old
walls
or
on
high
mountains
or
rocks
you
perceive
a
which
has
sprung
from
a
seed
that
a
bird
has
dropped
from
its
bill
you
must
either
knock
or
break
off
that
rod
or
tree
in
the
twilight
between
the
third
day
and
the
night
after
ladyday
but
you
must
take
care
that
neither
iron
nor
steel
touches
it
and
that
in
carrying
it
home
you
do
not
let
it
fall
on
the
ground
then
place
it
under
the
roof
on
a
spot
under
which
you
have
laid
various
metals
and
you
will
soon
be
surprised
to
see
how
that
rod
under
the
roof
gradually
bends
in
the
direction
of
the
metals
when
your
rod
has
sat
there
in
the
same
spot
for
fourteen
days
or
more
you
take
a
knife
or
an
awl
which
has
been
stroked
with
a
magnet
and
with
it
you
slit
the
bark
on
all
sides
and
pour
or
drop
the
blood
of
a
cock
best
of
all
the
blood
from
the
comb
of
a
cock
which
is
all
of
one
colour
on
the
said
slits
in
the
bark
and
when
the
blood
has
dried
the
rod
is
ready
and
will
give
public
proof
of
the
efficacy
of
its
marvellous
just
as
in
scandinavia
the
parasitic
rowan
is
deemed
a
countercharm
to
sorcery
so
in
germany
the
parasitic
mistletoe
is
still
commonly
considered
a
protection
against
witchcraft
and
in
sweden
as
we
saw
the
mistletoe
which
is
gathered
on
midsummer
eve
is
attached
to
the
ceiling
of
the
house
the
horse
s
stall
or
the
cow
s
crib
in
the
belief
that
this
renders
the
troll
powerless
to
injure
man
or
beast
the
view
that
the
mistletoe
was
not
merely
the
instrument
of
balder
s
death
but
that
it
contained
his
life
is
countenanced
by
the
analogy
of
a
scottish
superstition
tradition
ran
that
the
fate
of
the
hays
of
errol
an
estate
in
perthshire
near
the
firth
of
tay
was
bound
up
with
the
mistletoe
that
grew
on
a
certain
great
oak
a
member
of
the
hay
family
has
recorded
the
old
belief
as
follows
among
the
low
country
families
the
badges
are
now
almost
generally
forgotten
but
it
appears
by
an
ancient
and
the
tradition
of
a
few
old
people
in
perthshire
that
the
badge
of
the
hays
was
the
mistletoe
there
was
formerly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
errol
and
not
far
from
the
falcon
stone
a
vast
oak
of
an
unknown
age
and
upon
which
grew
a
profusion
of
the
plant
many
charms
and
legends
were
considered
to
be
connected
with
the
tree
and
the
duration
of
the
family
of
hay
was
said
to
be
united
with
its
existence
it
was
believed
that
a
sprig
of
the
mistletoe
cut
by
a
hay
on
allhallowmas
eve
with
a
new
dirk
and
after
surrounding
the
tree
three
times
sunwise
and
pronouncing
a
certain
spell
was
a
sure
charm
against
all
glamour
or
witchery
and
an
infallible
guard
in
the
day
of
battle
a
spray
gathered
in
the
same
manner
was
placed
in
the
cradle
of
infants
and
thought
to
defend
them
from
being
changed
for
by
the
fairies
finally
it
was
affirmed
that
when
the
root
of
the
oak
had
perished
the
grass
should
grow
in
the
hearth
of
errol
and
a
raven
should
sit
in
the
falcon
s
the
two
most
unlucky
deeds
which
could
be
done
by
one
of
the
name
of
hay
were
to
kill
a
white
falcon
and
to
cut
down
a
limb
from
the
oak
of
errol
when
the
old
tree
was
destroyed
i
could
never
learn
the
estate
has
been
some
time
sold
out
of
the
family
of
hay
and
of
course
it
is
said
that
the
fatal
oak
was
cut
down
a
short
time
the
old
superstition
is
recorded
in
verses
which
are
traditionally
ascribed
to
thomas
the
rhymer
the
mistletoe
bats
on
errol
s
aik
that
aik
stands
fast
hays
shall
flourish
and
their
good
grey
nocht
flinch
before
the
when
the
root
of
the
aik

mistletoe
dwines
on
its
withered
breast
grass
shall
grow
on
errol
s
hearthstane
the
corbie
roup
in
the
falcon
s
the
idea
that
the
fate
of
a
family
as
distinct
from
the
lives
of
its
members
is
bound
up
with
a
particular
plant
or
tree
is
no
doubt
comparatively
modern
the
older
view
may
have
been
that
the
lives
of
all
the
hays
were
in
this
particular
mistletoe
just
as
in
the
indian
story
the
lives
of
all
the
ogres
are
in
a
lemon
to
break
a
twig
of
the
mistletoe
would
then
have
been
to
kill
one
of
the
hays
similarly
in
the
island
of
rum
whose
bold
mountains
the
voyager
from
oban
to
skye
observes
to
seaward
it
was
thought
that
if
one
of
the
family
of
lachlin
shot
a
deer
on
the
mountain
of
finchra
he
would
die
suddenly
or
contract
a
distemper
which
would
soon
prove
fatal
probably
the
life
of
the
lachlins
was
bound
up
with
the
deer
on
finchra
as
the
life
of
the
hays
was
bound
up
with
the
mistletoe
on
errol
s
oak
and
the
life
of
the
dalhousie
family
with
the
edgewell
tree
it
is
not
a
new
opinion
that
the
golden
bough
was
the
mistletoe
true
virgil
does
not
identify
but
only
compares
it
with
mistletoe
but
this
may
be
only
a
poetical
device
to
cast
a
mystic
glamour
over
the
humble
plant
or
more
probably
his
description
was
based
on
a
popular
superstition
that
at
certain
times
the
mistletoe
blazed
out
into
a
supernatural
golden
glory
the
poet
tells
how
two
doves
guiding
aeneas
to
the
gloomy
vale
in
whose
depth
grew
the
golden
bough
alighted
upon
a
tree
whence
shone
a
flickering
gleam
of
gold
as
in
the
woods
in
winter
cold
the
plant
not
native
to
its
green
with
fresh
leaves
and
twines
its
yellow
berries
about
the
boles
such
seemed
upon
the
shady
the
leafy
gold
so
rustled
in
the
gentle
breeze
the
golden
here
virgil
definitely
describes
the
golden
bough
as
growing
on
a
and
compares
it
with
the
mistletoe
the
inference
is
almost
inevitable
that
the
golden
bough
was
nothing
but
the
mistletoe
seen
through
the
haze
of
poetry
or
of
popular
superstition
now
grounds
have
been
shewn
for
believing
that
the
priest
of
the
arician
king
of
the
the
tree
on
which
grew
the
golden
bough
hence
if
that
tree
was
the
oak
the
king
of
the
wood
must
have
been
a
personification
of
the
it
is
therefore
easy
to
understand
why
before
he
could
be
slain
it
was
necessary
to
break
the
golden
bough
as
an
his
life
or
death
was
in
the
mistletoe
on
the
oak
and
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
remained
intact
he
like
balder
could
not
die
to
slay
him
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
break
the
mistletoe
and
probably
as
in
the
case
of
balder
to
throw
it
at
him
and
to
complete
the
parallel
it
is
only
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
king
of
the
wood
was
formerly
burned
dead
or
alive
at
the
midsummer
fire
festival
which
as
we
have
seen
was
annually
celebrated
in
the
arician
grove
the
perpetual
fire
which
burned
in
the
grove
like
the
perpetual
fire
which
burned
in
the
temple
of
vesta
at
rome
and
under
the
oak
at
romove
was
probably
fed
with
the
sacred
and
thus
it
would
be
in
a
great
fire
of
oak
that
the
king
of
the
wood
formerly
met
his
end
at
a
later
time
as
i
have
suggested
his
annual
tenure
of
office
was
lengthened
or
shortened
as
the
case
might
be
by
the
rule
which
allowed
him
to
live
so
long
as
he
could
prove
his
divine
right
by
the
strong
hand
but
he
only
escaped
the
fire
to
fall
by
the
sword
thus
it
seems
that
at
a
remote
age
in
the
heart
of
italy
beside
the
sweet
lake
of
nemi
the
same
fiery
tragedy
was
annually
enacted
which
italian
merchants
and
soldiers
were
afterwards
to
witness
among
their
rude
kindred
the
celts
of
gaul
and
which
if
the
roman
eagles
had
ever
swooped
on
norway
might
have
been
found
repeated
with
little
difference
among
the
barbarous
aryans
of
the
north
the
rite
was
probably
an
essential
feature
in
the
ancient
aryan
worship
of
the
oak
it
only
remains
to
ask
why
was
the
mistletoe
called
the
golden
bough
the
of
the
mistletoe
berries
is
hardly
enough
to
account
for
the
name
for
virgil
says
that
the
bough
was
altogether
golden
stem
as
well
as
leaves
perhaps
the
name
may
be
derived
from
the
rich
golden
yellow
which
a
bough
of
mistletoe
assumes
when
it
has
been
cut
and
kept
for
some
months
the
bright
tint
is
not
confined
to
the
leaves
but
spreads
to
the
stalks
as
well
so
that
the
whole
branch
appears
to
be
indeed
a
golden
bough
breton
peasants
hang
up
great
bunches
of
mistletoe
in
front
of
their
cottages
and
in
the
month
of
june
these
bunches
are
conspicuous
for
the
bright
golden
tinge
of
their
foliage
in
some
parts
of
brittany
especially
about
morbihan
branches
of
mistletoe
are
hung
over
the
doors
of
stables
and
byres
to
protect
the
horses
and
cattle
probably
against
witchcraft
the
yellow
colour
of
the
withered
bough
may
partly
explain
why
the
mistletoe
has
been
sometimes
supposed
to
possess
the
property
of
disclosing
treasures
in
the
earth
for
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
there
is
a
natural
affinity
between
a
yellow
bough
and
yellow
gold
this
suggestion
is
confirmed
by
the
analogy
of
the
marvellous
properties
popularly
ascribed
to
the
mythical
or
we
saw
that
is
popularly
supposed
to
bloom
like
gold
or
fire
on
midsummer
eve
thus
in
bohemia
it
is
said
that
on
john
s
day
blooms
with
golden
blossoms
that
gleam
like
now
it
is
a
property
of
this
mythical
that
whoever
has
it
or
will
ascend
a
mountain
holding
it
in
his
hand
on
midsummer
eve
will
discover
a
vein
of
gold
or
will
see
the
treasures
of
the
earth
shining
with
a
bluish
flame
in
russia
they
say
that
if
you
succeed
in
catching
the
wondrous
bloom
of
the
fern
at
midnight
on
midsummer
eve
you
have
only
to
throw
it
up
into
the
air
and
it
will
fall
like
a
star
on
the
very
spot
where
a
treasure
lies
hidden
in
brittany
gather
at
midnight
on
midsummer
eve
and
keep
it
till
palm
sunday
of
the
following
year
then
they
strew
the
seed
on
ground
where
they
think
a
treasure
is
concealed
tyrolese
peasants
imagine
that
hidden
treasures
can
be
seen
glowing
like
flame
on
midsummer
eve
and
that
gathered
at
this
mystic
season
with
the
usual
precautions
will
help
to
bring
the
buried
gold
to
the
surface
in
the
swiss
canton
of
freiburg
people
used
to
watch
beside
a
fern
on
john
s
night
in
the
hope
of
winning
a
treasure
which
the
devil
himself
sometimes
brought
to
them
in
bohemia
they
say
that
he
who
procures
the
golden
bloom
of
the
fern
at
this
season
has
thereby
the
key
to
all
hidden
treasures
and
that
if
maidens
will
spread
a
cloth
under
the
bloom
red
gold
will
drop
into
it
and
in
the
tyrol
and
bohemia
if
you
place
among
money
the
money
will
never
decrease
however
much
of
it
you
spend
sometimes
the
is
supposed
to
bloom
on
christmas
night
and
whoever
catches
it
will
become
very
rich
in
styria
they
say
that
by
gathering
on
christmas
night
you
can
force
the
devil
to
bring
you
a
bag
of
money
in
swabia
likewise
you
can
by
taking
the
proper
precautions
compel
satan
himself
to
fetch
you
a
packet
of
on
christmas
night
but
for
four
weeks
previously
and
during
the
whole
of
the
advent
season
you
must
be
very
careful
never
to
pray
never
to
go
to
church
and
never
to
use
holy
water
you
must
busy
yourself
all
day
long
with
devilish
thoughts
and
cherish
an
ardent
wish
that
the
devil
would
help
you
to
get
money
thus
prepared
you
take
your
stand
between
eleven
and
twelve
on
christmas
night
at
the
meeting
of
two
roads
over
both
of
which
corpses
have
been
carried
to
the
churchyard
here
many
people
meet
you
some
of
them
dead
and
buried
long
ago
it
may
be
your
parents
or
grandparents
or
old
friends
and
acquaintances
and
they
stop
and
greet
you
and
ask
what
are
you
doing
here
and
tiny
little
goblins
hop
and
dance
about
and
try
to
make
you
laugh
but
if
you
smile
or
utter
a
single
word
the
devil
will
tear
you
to
shreds
and
tatters
on
the
spot
if
however
you
stand
glum
and
silent
and
solemn
there
will
come
after
all
the
ghostly
train
has
passed
by
a
man
dressed
as
a
hunter
and
that
is
the
devil
he
will
hand
you
a
paper
cornet
full
of
which
you
must
keep
and
carry
about
with
you
as
long
as
you
live
it
will
give
you
the
power
of
doing
as
much
work
at
your
trade
in
a
day
as
twenty
or
thirty
ordinary
men
could
do
in
the
same
time
so
you
will
grow
very
rich
but
few
people
have
the
courage
to
go
through
with
the
ordeal
the
people
of
rotenburg
tell
of
a
weaver
of
their
town
who
lived
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
and
performed
prodigies
of
weaving
by
a
simple
application
of
which
he
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
no
doubt
from
the
devil
though
that
is
not
expressly
alleged
by
tradition
rich
in
the
possession
of
this
treasure
the
lazy
rascal
worked
only
on
saturdays
and
spent
all
the
rest
of
the
week
playing
and
drinking
yet
in
one
day
he
wove
far
more
cloth
than
any
other
skilled
weaver
who
sat
at
his
loom
from
morning
to
night
every
day
of
the
week
naturally
he
kept
his
own
counsel
and
nobody
might
ever
have
known
how
he
did
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
what
humanly
speaking
you
might
call
an
accident
though
for
my
part
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
the
manifest
finger
of
providence
one
was
the
octave
of
a
fellow
had
woven
a
web
no
less
than
a
hundred
ells
long
and
his
mistress
resolved
to
deliver
it
to
her
customer
the
same
evening
so
she
put
the
cloth
in
a
basket
and
away
she
trudged
with
it
her
way
led
her
past
a
church
and
as
she
passed
the
sacred
edifice
she
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
holy
bell
which
announced
the
elevation
of
the
host
being
a
good
woman
she
put
her
basket
down
knelt
beside
it
and
there
with
the
shadows
gathering
round
her
committed
herself
to
the
care
of
god
and
his
good
angels
and
received
along
with
the
kneeling
congregation
in
the
lighted
church
the
evening
benediction
which
kept
her
and
them
from
all
the
perils
and
dangers
of
the
night
then
rising
refreshed
she
took
up
her
basket
but
what
was
her
astonishment
on
looking
into
it
to
find
the
whole
web
reduced
to
a
heap
of
yarn
the
blessed
words
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
had
undone
the
cursed
spell
of
the
enemy
of
mankind
thus
on
the
principle
of
like
by
like
is
supposed
to
discover
gold
because
it
is
itself
golden
and
for
a
similar
reason
it
enriches
its
possessor
with
an
unfailing
supply
of
gold
but
while
the
is
described
as
golden
it
is
equally
described
as
glowing
and
fiery
hence
when
we
consider
that
two
great
days
for
gathering
the
fabulous
seed
are
midsummer
eve
and
is
the
two
solstices
for
christmas
is
nothing
but
an
old
heathen
celebration
of
the
winter
solstice
are
led
to
regard
the
fiery
aspect
of
the
as
primary
and
its
golden
aspect
as
secondary
and
derivative
in
fact
would
seem
to
be
an
emanation
of
the
sun
s
fire
at
the
two
of
its
course
the
summer
and
winter
solstices
this
view
is
confirmed
by
a
german
story
in
which
a
hunter
is
said
to
have
procured
by
shooting
at
the
sun
on
midsummer
day
at
noon
three
drops
of
blood
fell
down
which
he
caught
in
a
white
cloth
and
these
were
the
here
the
blood
is
clearly
the
blood
of
the
sun
from
which
the
is
thus
directly
derived
thus
it
may
be
taken
as
probable
that
is
golden
because
it
is
believed
to
be
an
emanation
of
the
sun
s
golden
fire
now
like
the
mistletoe
is
gathered
either
at
midsummer
or
christmas
is
at
the
summer
and
winter
like
it
is
supposed
to
possess
the
power
of
revealing
treasures
in
the
earth
on
midsummer
eve
people
in
sweden
make
of
mistletoe
or
of
four
different
kinds
of
wood
one
of
which
must
be
mistletoe
the
places
the
rod
on
the
ground
after
and
when
it
rests
directly
over
treasure
the
rod
begins
to
move
as
if
it
were
alive
now
if
the
mistletoe
discovers
gold
it
must
be
in
its
character
of
the
golden
bough
and
if
it
is
gathered
at
the
solstices
must
not
the
golden
bough
like
the
golden
be
an
emanation
of
the
sun
s
fire
the
question
can
not
be
answered
with
a
simple
affirmative
we
have
seen
that
the
old
aryans
perhaps
kindled
the
solstitial
and
other
ceremonial
fires
in
part
as
that
is
with
the
intention
of
supplying
the
sun
with
fresh
fire
and
as
these
fires
were
usually
made
by
the
friction
or
combustion
of
it
may
have
appeared
to
the
ancient
aryan
that
the
sun
was
periodically
recruited
from
the
fire
which
resided
in
the
sacred
oak
in
other
words
the
oak
may
have
seemed
to
him
the
original
storehouse
or
reservoir
of
the
fire
which
was
from
time
to
time
drawn
out
to
feed
the
sun
but
if
the
life
of
the
oak
was
conceived
to
be
in
the
mistletoe
the
mistletoe
must
on
that
view
have
contained
the
seed
or
germ
of
the
fire
which
was
elicited
by
friction
from
the
wood
of
the
oak
thus
instead
of
saying
that
the
mistletoe
was
an
emanation
of
the
sun
s
fire
it
might
be
more
correct
to
say
that
the
sun
s
fire
was
regarded
as
an
emanation
of
the
mistletoe
no
wonder
then
that
the
mistletoe
shone
with
a
golden
splendour
and
was
called
the
golden
bough
probably
however
like
it
was
thought
to
assume
its
golden
aspect
only
at
those
stated
times
especially
midsummer
when
fire
was
drawn
from
the
oak
to
light
up
the
sun
at
pulverbatch
in
shropshire
it
was
believed
within
living
memory
that
the
blooms
on
midsummer
eve
and
the
blossom
withers
before
daylight
a
maiden
who
wishes
to
know
her
lot
in
marriage
should
spread
a
white
cloth
under
the
tree
at
night
and
in
the
morning
she
will
find
a
little
dust
which
is
all
that
remains
of
the
flower
she
should
place
the
pinch
of
dust
under
her
pillow
and
then
her
future
husband
will
appear
to
her
in
her
dreams
this
fleeting
bloom
of
the
oak
if
i
am
right
was
probably
the
mistletoe
in
its
character
of
the
golden
bough
the
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
in
wales
a
real
sprig
of
mistletoe
gathered
on
midsummer
eve
is
similarly
placed
under
the
pillow
to
induce
prophetic
dreams
and
further
the
mode
of
catching
the
imaginary
bloom
of
the
oak
in
a
white
cloth
is
exactly
that
which
was
employed
by
the
druids
to
catch
the
real
mistletoe
when
it
dropped
from
the
bough
of
the
oak
severed
by
the
golden
sickle
as
shropshire
borders
on
wales
the
belief
that
the
oak
blooms
on
midsummer
eve
may
be
welsh
in
its
immediate
origin
though
probably
the
belief
is
a
fragment
of
the
primitive
aryan
creed
in
some
parts
of
italy
as
we
saw
peasants
still
go
out
on
midsummer
morning
to
search
the
for
the
oil
of
john
which
like
the
mistletoe
heals
all
wounds
and
is
perhaps
the
mistletoe
itself
in
its
glorified
aspect
thus
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
a
title
like
the
golden
bough
so
little
descriptive
of
its
usual
appearance
on
the
tree
should
have
been
applied
to
the
seemingly
insignificant
parasite
further
we
can
perhaps
see
why
in
antiquity
mistletoe
was
believed
to
possess
the
remarkable
property
of
extinguishing
fire
and
why
in
sweden
it
is
still
kept
in
houses
as
a
safeguard
against
conflagration
its
fiery
nature
marks
it
out
on
homoeopathic
principles
as
the
best
possible
cure
or
preventive
of
injury
by
fire
these
considerations
may
partially
explain
why
virgil
makes
aeneas
carry
a
glorified
bough
of
mistletoe
with
him
on
his
descent
into
the
gloomy
subterranean
world
the
poet
describes
how
at
the
very
gates
of
hell
there
stretched
a
vast
and
gloomy
wood
and
how
the
hero
following
the
flight
of
two
doves
that
lured
him
on
wandered
into
the
depths
of
the
immemorial
forest
till
he
saw
afar
off
through
the
shadows
of
the
trees
the
flickering
light
of
the
golden
bough
illuminating
the
matted
boughs
overhead
if
the
mistletoe
as
a
yellow
withered
bough
in
the
sad
autumn
woods
was
conceived
to
contain
the
seed
of
fire
what
better
companion
could
a
forlorn
wanderer
in
the
nether
shades
take
with
him
than
a
bough
that
would
be
a
lamp
to
his
feet
as
well
as
a
rod
and
staff
to
his
hands
armed
with
it
he
might
boldly
confront
the
dreadful
spectres
that
would
cross
his
path
on
his
adventurous
journey
hence
when
aeneas
emerging
from
the
forest
comes
to
the
banks
of
styx
winding
slow
with
sluggish
stream
through
the
infernal
marsh
and
the
surly
ferryman
refuses
him
passage
in
his
boat
he
has
but
to
draw
the
golden
bough
from
his
bosom
and
hold
it
up
and
straightway
the
blusterer
quails
at
the
sight
and
meekly
receives
the
hero
into
his
crazy
bark
which
sinks
deep
in
the
water
under
the
unusual
weight
of
the
living
man
even
in
recent
times
as
we
have
seen
mistletoe
has
been
deemed
a
protection
against
witches
and
trolls
and
the
ancients
may
well
have
credited
it
with
the
same
magical
virtue
and
if
the
parasite
can
as
some
of
our
peasants
believe
open
all
locks
why
should
it
not
have
served
as
an
open
sesame
in
the
hands
of
aeneas
to
unlock
the
gates
of
death
there
is
some
reason
to
suppose
that
when
orpheus
in
like
manner
descended
alive
to
hell
to
rescue
the
soul
of
his
dead
wife
eurydice
from
the
shades
he
carried
with
him
a
willow
bough
to
serve
as
a
passport
on
his
journey
to
and
from
the
land
of
the
dead
for
in
the
great
frescoes
representing
the
nether
world
with
which
the
master
hand
of
polygnotus
adorned
the
walls
of
a
loggia
at
delphi
orpheus
was
depicted
sitting
pensively
under
a
willow
holding
his
lyre
now
silent
and
useless
in
his
left
hand
while
with
his
right
he
grasped
the
drooping
boughs
of
the
tree
if
the
willow
in
the
picture
had
indeed
the
significance
which
an
ingenious
scholar
has
attributed
to
it
the
painter
meant
to
represent
the
dead
musician
dreaming
wistfully
of
the
time
when
the
willow
had
carried
him
safe
back
across
the
stygian
ferry
to
that
bright
world
of
love
and
music
which
he
was
now
to
see
no
more
again
on
an
ancient
sarcophagus
which
exhibits
in
sculptured
relief
the
parting
of
adonis
from
aphrodite
the
hapless
youth
reclining
in
the
lap
of
his
leman
holds
a
branch
which
has
been
taken
to
signify
that
he
too
by
the
help
of
the
mystic
bough
might
yet
be
brought
back
from
the
gates
of
death
to
life
and
love
now
too
we
can
conjecture
why
virbius
at
nemi
came
to
be
confounded
with
the
sun
if
virbius
was
as
i
have
tried
to
shew
a
he
must
have
been
the
spirit
of
the
oak
on
which
grew
the
golden
bough
for
tradition
represented
him
as
the
first
of
the
kings
of
the
wood
as
an
he
must
have
been
supposed
periodically
to
rekindle
the
sun
s
fire
and
might
therefore
easily
be
confounded
with
the
sun
itself
similarly
we
can
explain
why
balder
an
was
described
as
so
fair
of
face
and
so
shining
that
a
light
went
forth
from
him
and
why
he
should
have
been
so
often
taken
to
be
the
sun
and
in
general
we
may
say
that
in
primitive
society
when
the
only
known
way
of
making
fire
is
by
the
friction
of
wood
the
savage
must
necessarily
conceive
of
fire
as
a
property
stored
away
like
sap
or
juice
in
trees
from
which
he
has
laboriously
to
extract
it
the
senal
indians
of
california
profess
to
believe
that
the
whole
world
was
once
a
globe
of
fire
whence
that
element
passed
up
into
the
trees
and
now
comes
out
whenever
two
pieces
of
wood
are
rubbed
similarly
the
maidu
indians
of
california
hold
that
the
earth
was
primarily
a
globe
of
molten
matter
and
from
that
the
principle
of
fire
ascended
through
the
roots
into
the
trunk
and
branches
of
trees
whence
the
indians
can
extract
it
by
means
of
their
in
namoluk
one
of
the
caroline
islands
they
say
that
the
art
of
making
fire
was
taught
men
by
the
gods
olofaet
the
cunning
master
of
flames
gave
fire
to
the
bird
and
bade
him
carry
it
to
earth
in
his
bill
so
the
bird
flew
from
tree
to
tree
and
stored
away
the
slumbering
force
of
the
fire
in
the
wood
from
which
men
can
elicit
it
by
friction
in
the
ancient
vedic
hymns
of
india
the
agni
is
spoken
of
as
born
in
wood
as
the
embryo
of
plants
or
as
distributed
in
plants
he
is
also
said
to
have
entered
into
all
plants
or
to
strive
after
them
when
he
is
called
the
embryo
of
trees
or
of
trees
as
well
as
plants
there
may
be
a
at
the
fire
produced
in
forests
by
the
friction
of
the
boughs
of
in
some
australian
languages
the
words
for
wood
and
fire
are
said
to
be
the
same
a
tree
which
has
been
struck
by
lightning
is
naturally
regarded
by
the
savage
as
charged
with
a
double
or
triple
portion
of
fire
for
has
he
not
seen
the
mighty
flash
enter
into
the
trunk
with
his
own
eyes
hence
perhaps
we
may
explain
some
of
the
many
superstitious
beliefs
concerning
trees
that
have
been
struck
by
lightning
thus
in
the
opinion
of
the
cherokee
indians
mysterious
properties
attach
to
the
wood
of
a
tree
which
has
been
struck
by
lightning
especially
when
the
tree
itself
still
lives
and
such
wood
enters
largely
into
the
secret
compounds
of
the
conjurers
an
ordinary
person
of
the
laity
will
not
touch
it
for
fear
of
having
cracks
come
upon
his
hands
and
feet
nor
is
it
burned
for
fuel
for
fear
that
lye
made
from
the
ashes
will
cause
consumption
in
preparing
ballplayers
for
the
contest
the
sometimes
burns
splinters
of
it
to
coal
which
he
gives
to
the
players
to
paint
themselves
with
in
order
that
they
may
be
able
to
strike
their
opponents
with
all
the
force
of
a
thunderbolt
bark
or
wood
from
a
tree
struck
by
lightning
but
still
green
is
beaten
up
and
put
into
the
water
in
which
seeds
are
soaked
before
planting
to
insure
a
good
crop
but
on
the
other
hand
any
wood
thrown
into
the
field
will
cause
the
crop
to
wither
and
it
is
believed
to
have
a
bad
effect
even
to
go
into
the
field
immediately
after
having
been
near
such
a
apparently
the
cherokees
imagine
that
when
wood
struck
by
lightning
is
soaked
in
water
the
fierce
heat
of
the
slumbering
fire
in
its
veins
is
tempered
to
a
genial
warmth
which
promotes
the
growth
of
the
crops
but
that
when
the
force
of
the
fire
has
not
been
thus
diluted
it
blasts
the
growing
corn
when
the
thompson
indians
of
british
columbia
wished
to
set
fire
to
the
houses
of
their
enemies
they
shot
at
them
arrows
which
were
either
made
from
a
tree
that
had
been
struck
by
lightning
or
had
splinters
of
such
wood
attached
to
them
they
seem
to
have
thought
that
wood
struck
by
lightning
was
so
charged
with
fire
that
it
would
ignite
whatever
it
struck
the
mere
concussion
sufficing
to
explode
it
like
gunpowder
yet
curiously
enough
these
indians
supposed
that
if
they
burned
the
wood
of
trees
that
had
been
struck
by
lightning
the
weather
would
immediately
turn
cold
perhaps
they
conceived
such
trees
as
reservoirs
of
heat
and
imagined
that
by
using
them
up
they
would
exhaust
the
supply
and
thus
lower
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
wendish
peasants
of
saxony
similarly
refuse
to
burn
in
their
stoves
the
wood
of
trees
that
have
been
struck
by
lightning
but
the
reason
they
give
for
their
refusal
is
different
they
say
that
with
such
fuel
the
house
would
be
burnt
down
no
doubt
they
think
that
the
electric
flash
inherent
in
the
wood
would
send
such
a
roaring
flame
up
the
chimney
that
nothing
could
stand
before
it
in
like
manner
the
thonga
of
south
africa
will
not
use
such
wood
as
fuel
nor
warm
themselves
at
a
fire
which
has
been
kindled
with
it
but
what
danger
they
apprehend
from
the
wood
we
are
not
told
on
the
contrary
when
lightning
sets
fire
to
a
tree
the
winamwanga
of
northern
rhodesia
put
out
all
the
fires
in
the
village
and
plaster
the
fireplaces
afresh
while
the
head
men
convey
the
fire
to
the
chief
who
prays
over
it
the
chief
then
sends
out
the
new
fire
to
all
his
villages
and
the
villagers
reward
his
messengers
for
the
boon
this
shews
that
they
look
upon
fire
kindled
by
lightning
with
reverence
and
the
reverence
is
intelligible
for
they
speak
of
thunder
and
lightning
as
god
himself
coming
down
to
earth
similarly
the
maidu
indians
of
california
believe
that
a
great
man
created
the
world
and
all
its
inhabitants
and
that
lightning
is
nothing
but
the
great
man
himself
descending
swiftly
out
of
heaven
and
rending
the
trees
with
his
flaming
arm
it
is
a
plausible
theory
that
the
reverence
which
the
ancient
peoples
of
europe
paid
to
the
oak
and
the
connexion
which
they
traced
between
the
tree
and
their
were
derived
from
the
much
greater
frequency
with
which
the
oak
appears
to
be
struck
by
lightning
than
any
other
tree
of
our
european
forests
some
remarkable
statistics
have
been
adduced
in
support
of
this
view
by
warde
fowler
observations
annually
made
in
the
forests
of
for
seventeen
years
yielded
the
result
that
while
the
woods
were
mainly
stocked
with
beech
and
only
to
a
small
extent
with
oak
and
scotch
pine
yet
far
more
oaks
and
scotch
pines
were
struck
by
lightning
than
beeches
the
number
of
stricken
scotch
pines
exceeding
the
number
of
stricken
beeches
in
the
proportion
of
to
one
and
the
number
of
stricken
oaks
exceeding
the
number
of
stricken
beeches
in
the
proportion
of
no
less
than
sixty
to
one
similar
results
have
been
obtained
from
observations
made
in
french
and
bavarian
forests
in
short
it
would
seem
from
statistics
compiled
by
scientific
observers
who
have
no
mythological
theories
to
maintain
that
the
oak
suffers
from
the
stroke
of
lightning
far
oftener
than
any
other
forest
tree
in
europe
however
we
may
explain
it
whether
by
the
easier
passage
of
electricity
through
oakwood
than
through
any
other
timber
or
in
some
other
way
the
fact
itself
may
well
have
attracted
the
notice
of
our
rude
forefathers
who
dwelt
in
the
vast
forests
which
then
covered
a
large
part
of
europe
and
they
might
naturally
account
for
it
in
their
simple
religious
way
by
supposing
that
the
great
whom
they
worshipped
and
whose
awful
voice
they
heard
in
the
roll
of
thunder
loved
the
oak
above
all
the
trees
of
the
wood
and
often
descended
into
it
from
the
murky
cloud
in
a
flash
of
lightning
leaving
a
token
of
his
presence
or
of
his
passage
in
the
riven
and
blackened
trunk
and
the
blasted
foliage
such
trees
would
thenceforth
be
encircled
by
a
nimbus
of
glory
as
the
visible
seats
of
the
thundering
certain
it
is
that
like
some
savages
both
greeks
and
romans
identified
their
great
god
of
the
sky
and
of
the
oak
with
the
lightning
flash
which
struck
the
ground
and
they
regularly
enclosed
such
a
stricken
spot
and
treated
it
thereafter
as
sacred
it
is
not
rash
to
suppose
that
the
ancestors
of
the
celts
and
germans
in
the
forests
of
central
europe
paid
a
like
respect
for
like
reasons
to
a
blasted
oak
this
explanation
of
the
aryan
reverence
for
the
oak
and
of
the
association
of
the
tree
with
the
great
god
of
the
thunder
and
the
sky
was
suggested
or
implied
long
ago
by
jacob
grimm
and
has
been
of
late
powerfully
reinforced
by
warde
fowler
it
appears
to
be
simpler
and
more
probable
than
the
explanation
which
i
formerly
adopted
namely
that
the
oak
was
worshipped
primarily
for
the
many
benefits
which
our
rude
forefathers
derived
from
the
tree
particularly
for
the
fire
which
they
drew
by
friction
from
its
wood
and
that
the
connexion
of
the
oak
with
the
sky
was
an
based
on
the
belief
that
the
flash
of
lightning
was
nothing
but
the
spark
which
the
up
aloft
elicited
by
rubbing
two
pieces
of
oak
wood
against
each
other
just
as
his
savage
worshipper
kindled
fire
in
the
forest
on
earth
on
that
theory
the
god
of
the
thunder
and
the
sky
was
derived
from
the
original
god
of
the
oak
on
the
present
theory
which
i
now
prefer
the
god
of
the
sky
and
the
thunder
was
the
great
original
deity
of
our
aryan
ancestors
and
his
association
with
the
oak
was
merely
an
inference
based
on
the
frequency
with
which
the
oak
was
seen
to
be
struck
by
lightning
if
the
aryans
as
some
think
roamed
the
wide
steppes
of
russia
or
central
asia
with
their
flocks
and
herds
before
they
plunged
into
the
gloom
of
the
european
forests
they
may
have
worshipped
the
god
of
the
blue
or
cloudy
firmament
and
the
flashing
thunderbolt
long
before
they
thought
of
associating
him
with
the
blasted
oaks
in
their
new
home
perhaps
the
new
theory
has
the
further
advantage
of
throwing
light
on
the
special
sanctity
ascribed
to
mistletoe
which
grows
on
an
oak
the
mere
rarity
of
such
a
growth
on
an
oak
hardly
suffices
to
explain
the
extent
and
the
persistence
of
the
superstition
a
hint
of
its
real
origin
is
possibly
furnished
by
the
statement
of
pliny
that
the
druids
worshipped
the
plant
because
they
believed
it
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
and
to
be
a
token
that
the
tree
on
which
it
grew
was
chosen
by
the
god
himself
can
they
have
thought
that
the
mistletoe
dropped
on
the
oak
in
a
flash
of
lightning
the
conjecture
is
confirmed
by
the
name
which
is
applied
to
mistletoe
in
the
swiss
canton
of
aargau
for
the
epithet
clearly
implies
a
close
connexion
between
the
parasite
and
the
thunder
indeed
is
a
popular
name
in
germany
for
any
bushy
excrescence
growing
on
a
branch
because
such
a
parasitic
growth
is
actually
believed
by
the
ignorant
to
be
a
product
of
lightning
if
there
is
any
truth
in
this
conjecture
the
real
reason
why
the
druids
worshipped
a
oak
above
all
other
trees
of
the
forest
was
a
belief
that
every
such
oak
had
not
only
been
struck
by
lightning
but
bore
among
its
branches
a
visible
emanation
of
the
celestial
fire
so
that
in
cutting
the
mistletoe
with
mystic
rites
they
were
securing
for
themselves
all
the
magical
properties
of
a
thunderbolt
if
that
was
so
we
must
apparently
conclude
that
the
mistletoe
was
deemed
an
emanation
of
the
lightning
rather
than
as
i
have
thus
far
argued
of
the
midsummer
sun
perhaps
indeed
we
might
combine
the
two
seemingly
divergent
views
by
supposing
that
in
the
old
aryan
creed
the
mistletoe
descended
from
the
sun
on
midsummer
day
in
a
flash
of
lightning
but
such
a
combination
is
artificial
and
unsupported
so
far
as
i
know
by
any
positive
evidence
whether
on
mythical
principles
the
two
interpretations
can
really
be
reconciled
with
each
other
or
not
i
will
not
presume
to
say
but
even
should
they
prove
to
be
discrepant
the
inconsistency
need
not
have
prevented
our
rude
forefathers
from
embracing
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
with
an
equal
fervour
of
conviction
for
like
the
great
majority
of
mankind
the
savage
is
above
being
hidebound
by
the
trammels
of
a
pedantic
logic
in
attempting
to
track
his
devious
thought
through
the
jungle
of
crass
ignorance
and
blind
fear
we
must
always
remember
that
we
are
treading
enchanted
ground
and
must
beware
of
taking
for
solid
realities
the
cloudy
shapes
that
cross
our
path
or
hover
and
gibber
at
us
through
the
gloom
we
can
never
completely
replace
ourselves
at
the
standpoint
of
primitive
man
see
things
with
his
eyes
and
feel
our
hearts
beat
with
the
emotions
that
stirred
his
all
our
theories
concerning
him
and
his
ways
must
therefore
fall
far
short
of
certainty
the
utmost
we
can
aspire
to
in
such
matters
is
a
reasonable
degree
of
probability
to
conclude
these
enquiries
we
may
say
that
if
balder
was
indeed
as
i
have
conjectured
a
personification
of
a
oak
his
death
by
a
blow
of
the
mistletoe
might
on
the
new
theory
be
explained
as
a
death
by
a
stroke
of
lightning
so
long
as
the
mistletoe
in
which
the
flame
of
the
lightning
smouldered
was
suffered
to
remain
among
the
boughs
so
long
no
harm
could
befall
the
good
and
kindly
god
of
the
oak
who
kept
his
life
stowed
away
for
safety
between
earth
and
heaven
in
the
mysterious
parasite
but
when
once
that
seat
of
his
life
or
of
his
death
was
torn
from
the
branch
and
hurled
at
the
trunk
the
tree
god
by
a
thunderbolt
and
what
we
have
said
of
balder
in
the
oak
forests
of
scandinavia
may
perhaps
with
all
due
diffidence
in
a
question
so
obscure
and
uncertain
be
applied
to
the
priest
of
diana
the
king
of
the
wood
at
aricia
in
the
oak
forests
of
italy
he
may
have
personated
in
flesh
and
blood
the
great
italian
god
of
the
sky
jupiter
who
had
kindly
come
down
from
heaven
in
the
lightning
flash
to
dwell
among
men
in
the
golden
on
the
sacred
oak
beside
the
still
waters
of
the
lake
of
nemi
if
that
was
so
we
need
not
wonder
that
the
priest
guarded
with
drawn
sword
the
mystic
bough
which
contained
the
god
s
life
and
his
own
the
goddess
whom
he
served
and
married
was
herself
if
i
am
right
no
other
than
the
queen
of
heaven
the
true
wife
of
the
for
she
too
loved
the
solitude
of
the
woods
and
the
lonely
hills
and
sailing
overhead
on
clear
nights
in
the
likeness
of
the
silver
moon
she
looked
down
with
pleasure
on
her
own
fair
image

on
the
calm

of

chapter
xiii
farewell
to
nemi
we
are
at
the
end
of
our
enquiry
but
as
often
happens
in
the
search
after
truth
if
we
have
answered
one
question
we
have
raised
many
more
if
we
have
followed
one
track
home
we
have
had
to
pass
by
others
that
opened
off
it
and
led
or
seemed
to
lead
to
far
other
goals
than
the
sacred
grove
at
nemi
some
of
these
paths
we
have
followed
a
little
way
others
if
fortune
should
be
kind
the
writer
and
the
reader
may
one
day
pursue
together
for
the
present
we
have
journeyed
far
enough
together
and
it
is
time
to
part
yet
before
we
do
so
we
may
well
ask
ourselves
whether
there
is
not
some
more
general
conclusion
some
lesson
if
possible
of
hope
and
encouragement
to
be
drawn
from
the
melancholy
record
of
human
error
and
folly
which
has
engaged
our
attention
in
these
volumes
if
then
we
consider
on
the
one
hand
the
essential
similarity
of
man
s
chief
wants
everywhere
and
at
all
times
and
on
the
other
hand
the
wide
difference
between
the
means
he
has
adopted
to
satisfy
them
in
different
ages
we
shall
perhaps
be
disposed
to
conclude
that
the
movement
of
the
higher
thought
so
far
as
we
can
trace
it
has
on
the
whole
been
from
magic
through
religion
to
science
in
magic
man
depends
on
his
own
strength
to
meet
the
difficulties
and
dangers
that
beset
him
on
every
side
he
believes
in
a
certain
established
order
of
nature
on
which
he
can
surely
count
and
which
he
can
manipulate
for
his
own
ends
when
he
discovers
his
mistake
when
he
recognizes
sadly
that
both
the
order
of
nature
which
he
had
assumed
and
the
control
which
he
had
believed
himself
to
exercise
over
it
were
purely
imaginary
he
ceases
to
rely
on
his
own
intelligence
and
his
own
unaided
efforts
and
throws
himself
humbly
on
the
mercy
of
certain
great
invisible
beings
behind
the
veil
of
nature
to
whom
he
now
ascribes
all
those
powers
which
he
once
arrogated
to
himself
thus
in
the
acuter
minds
magic
is
gradually
superseded
by
religion
which
explains
the
succession
of
natural
phenomena
as
regulated
by
the
will
the
passion
or
the
caprice
of
spiritual
beings
like
man
in
kind
though
vastly
superior
to
him
in
power
but
as
time
goes
on
this
explanation
in
its
turn
proves
to
be
unsatisfactory
for
it
assumes
that
the
succession
of
natural
events
is
not
determined
by
immutable
laws
but
is
to
some
extent
variable
and
irregular
and
this
assumption
is
not
borne
out
by
closer
observation
on
the
contrary
the
more
we
scrutinize
that
succession
the
more
we
are
struck
by
the
rigid
uniformity
the
punctual
precision
with
which
wherever
we
can
follow
them
the
operations
of
nature
are
carried
on
every
great
advance
in
knowledge
has
extended
the
sphere
of
order
and
correspondingly
restricted
the
sphere
of
apparent
disorder
in
the
world
till
now
we
are
ready
to
anticipate
that
even
in
regions
where
chance
and
confusion
appear
still
to
reign
a
fuller
knowledge
would
everywhere
reduce
the
seeming
chaos
to
cosmos
thus
the
keener
minds
still
pressing
forward
to
a
deeper
solution
of
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
come
to
reject
the
religious
theory
of
nature
as
inadequate
and
to
revert
in
a
measure
to
the
older
standpoint
of
magic
by
postulating
explicitly
what
in
magic
had
only
been
implicitly
assumed
to
wit
an
inflexible
regularity
in
the
order
of
natural
events
which
if
carefully
observed
enables
us
to
foresee
their
course
with
certainty
and
to
act
accordingly
in
short
religion
regarded
as
an
explanation
of
nature
is
displaced
by
science
but
while
science
has
this
much
in
common
with
magic
that
both
rest
on
a
faith
in
order
as
the
underlying
principle
of
all
things
readers
of
this
work
will
hardly
need
to
be
reminded
that
the
order
presupposed
by
magic
differs
widely
from
that
which
forms
the
basis
of
science
the
difference
flows
naturally
from
the
different
modes
in
which
the
two
orders
have
been
reached
for
whereas
the
order
on
which
magic
reckons
is
merely
an
extension
by
false
analogy
of
the
order
in
which
ideas
present
themselves
to
our
minds
the
order
laid
down
by
science
is
derived
from
patient
and
exact
observation
of
the
phenomena
themselves
the
abundance
the
solidity
and
the
splendour
of
the
results
already
achieved
by
science
are
well
fitted
to
inspire
us
with
a
cheerful
confidence
in
the
soundness
of
its
method
here
at
last
after
groping
about
in
the
dark
for
countless
ages
man
has
hit
upon
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
a
golden
key
that
opens
many
locks
in
the
treasury
of
nature
it
is
probably
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
hope
of
and
intellectual
as
well
as
the
future
is
bound
up
with
the
fortunes
of
science
and
that
every
obstacle
placed
in
the
way
of
scientific
discovery
is
a
wrong
to
humanity
yet
the
history
of
thought
should
warn
us
against
concluding
that
because
the
scientific
theory
of
the
world
is
the
best
that
has
yet
been
formulated
it
is
necessarily
complete
and
final
we
must
remember
that
at
bottom
the
generalizations
of
science
or
in
common
parlance
the
laws
of
nature
are
merely
hypotheses
devised
to
explain
that
phantasmagoria
of
thought
which
we
dignify
with
the
names
of
the
world
and
the
universe
in
the
last
analysis
magic
religion
and
science
are
nothing
but
theories
of
thought
and
as
science
has
supplanted
its
predecessors
so
it
may
hereafter
be
itself
superseded
by
some
more
perfect
hypothesis
perhaps
by
some
totally
different
way
of
looking
at
the
registering
the
shadows
on
the
which
we
in
this
generation
can
form
no
idea
the
advance
of
knowledge
is
an
infinite
progression
towards
a
goal
that
for
ever
recedes
we
need
not
murmur
at
the
endless
pursuit
non
foste
a
viver
come
per
seguir
virtute
e
great
things
will
come
of
that
pursuit
though
we
may
not
enjoy
them
brighter
stars
will
rise
on
some
voyager
of
the
great
ulysses
of
the
realms
of
shine
on
us
the
dreams
of
magic
may
one
day
be
the
waking
realities
of
science
but
a
dark
shadow
lies
athwart
the
far
end
of
this
fair
prospect
for
however
vast
the
increase
of
knowledge
and
of
power
which
the
future
may
have
in
store
for
man
he
can
scarcely
hope
to
stay
the
sweep
of
those
great
forces
which
seem
to
be
making
silently
but
relentlessly
for
the
destruction
of
all
this
starry
universe
in
which
our
earth
swims
as
a
speck
or
mote
in
the
ages
to
come
man
may
be
able
to
predict
perhaps
even
to
control
the
wayward
courses
of
the
winds
and
clouds
but
hardly
will
his
puny
hands
have
strength
to
speed
afresh
our
slackening
planet
in
its
orbit
or
rekindle
the
dying
fire
of
the
sun
yet
the
philosopher
who
trembles
at
the
idea
of
such
distant
catastrophes
may
console
himself
by
reflecting
that
these
gloomy
apprehensions
like
the
earth
and
the
sun
themselves
are
only
parts
of
that
unsubstantial
world
which
thought
has
conjured
up
out
of
the
void
and
that
the
phantoms
which
the
subtle
enchantress
has
evoked
she
may
ban
they
too
like
so
much
that
to
common
eyes
seems
solid
may
melt
into
air
into
thin
air
without
dipping
so
far
into
the
future
we
may
illustrate
the
course
which
thought
has
hitherto
run
by
likening
it
to
a
web
woven
of
three
different
black
thread
of
magic
the
red
thread
of
religion
and
the
white
thread
of
science
if
under
science
we
may
include
those
simple
truths
drawn
from
observation
of
nature
of
which
men
in
all
ages
have
possessed
a
store
could
we
then
survey
the
web
of
thought
from
the
beginning
we
should
probably
perceive
it
to
be
at
first
a
chequer
of
black
and
white
a
patchwork
of
true
and
false
notions
hardly
tinged
as
yet
by
the
red
thread
of
religion
but
carry
your
eye
further
along
the
fabric
and
you
will
remark
that
while
the
black
and
white
chequer
still
runs
through
it
there
rests
on
the
middle
portion
of
the
web
where
religion
has
entered
most
deeply
into
its
texture
a
dark
crimson
stain
which
shades
off
insensibly
into
a
lighter
tint
as
the
white
thread
of
science
is
woven
more
and
more
into
the
tissue
to
a
web
thus
chequered
and
stained
thus
shot
with
threads
of
diverse
hues
but
gradually
changing
colour
the
farther
it
is
unrolled
the
state
of
modern
thought
with
all
its
divergent
aims
and
conflicting
tendencies
may
be
compared
will
the
great
movement
which
for
centuries
has
been
slowly
altering
the
complexion
of
thought
be
continued
in
the
near
future
or
will
a
reaction
set
in
which
may
arrest
progress
and
even
undo
much
that
has
been
done
to
keep
up
our
parable
what
will
be
the
colour
of
the
web
which
the
fates
are
now
weaving
on
the
humming
loom
of
time

as

stones
the
belief
of
the
scottish
highlanders
as
to
the

has
been
recorded
as
follows
by
a
good
authority
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
product
called
serpent
stone
is
found
on
the
root
of
the
long
ling
it
is
of
colour
has
the
consistency
of
soft
putty
when
new
and
of
hard
putty
when
old
and
is
as
light
as
which
it
resembles
it
is
of
a
globular
form
and
from
one
to
three
inches
in
diameter
there
is
a
circular
hole
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
in
width
through
the
centre
this
substance
is
said
to
be
produced
by
the
serpent
emitting
spume
round
the
root
of
a

of

the
transformation
of
witches
into

the
european
belief
that
witches
can
turn
themselves
into
cats
and
that
any
wounds
inflicted
on
the
will
afterwards
be
found
on
the
body
of
the
witch
herself
has
its
exact
parallel
among
the
oraons
or
uraons
a
primitive
hill
tribe
of
bengal
the
following
is
the
account
given
of
the
oraon
belief
by
a
jesuit
missionary
who
laboured
for
years
among
these
savages
and
was
intimately
acquainted
with
their
superstitions
is
a
witch
rather
than
a
demon
it
is
believed
that
some
women
have
the
power
to
change
their
soul
into
a
black
cat
who
then
goes
about
in
the
houses
where
there
are
sick
people
such
a
cat
has
a
peculiar
way
of
mewing
quite
different
from
its
brethren
and
is
easily
recognised
it
steals
quietly
into
the
house
licks
the
lips
of
the
sick
man
and
eats
of
the
food
that
has
been
prepared
for
him
the
sick
man
soon
gets
worse
and
dies
they
say
it
is
very
difficult
to
catch
the
cat
as
it
has
all
the
nimbleness
of
its
nature
and
the
cleverness
of
a
however
they
sometimes
succeed
and
then
something
wonderful
happens
the
woman

the

has

remains
insensible

it

out

the
woman
will

african
balders
in
various
parts
of
africa
stories
are
told
of
men
who
could
only
be
killed
like
balder
by
the
stroke
of
an
apparently
insignificant
weapon
and
some
at
least
of
these
men
were
not
mythical
beings
but
real
men
of
flesh
and
blood
who
lived
not
long
ago
and
whose
memory
is
still
comparatively
fresh
among
their
people
the
wadoe
of
german
east
africa
tell
such
a
story
of
a
great
sorcerer
whom
they
now
worship
as
a
dispenser
of
sunshine
and
rain
the
legend
and
the
worship
are
reported
as
follows
by
a
native
african
traveller
if
drought
sets
in
all
the
chiefs
meet
in
council
and
resolve
this
year
we
have
had
nothing
but
sunshine
when
we
plant
the
fruits
will
not
ripen
therefore
we
must
betake
ourselves
to
our
spirits
of
the
dead
then
they
take
some
woollen
stuff
dyed
blue
and
a
red
cloth
and
set
out
together
on
the
way
and
go
to
the
district
nguu
where
their
principal
ghost
resides
in
order
to
lay
the
matter
before
him
the
ghost
dwells
in
a
very
spacious
cave
on
their
coming
the
chiefs
greet
him
his
answer
consists
in
a
humming
noise
which
sounds
like
the
patter
of
rain
if
one
among
them
is
a
bad
man
the
ghost
says
to
them
there
is
come
with
you
in
the
caravan
a
rascal
who
wears
such
and
such
if
such
a
man
there
is
he
is
driven
away
now
they
tell
the
ghost
all
that
they
wish
to
say
to
wit
this
year
thou
hast
given
us
much
sunshine
the
fruits
in
the
fields
do
not
grow
tall
everywhere
there
is
sickness
therefore
we
beg
thee
give
us
thereupon
the
ghost
hums
a
second
time
and
all
are
glad
because
he
has
answered
them
but
if
the
ghost
is
angry
he
does
not
answer
but
holds
his
peace
if
he
has
made
them
glad
and
given
an
answer
much
rain
will
fall
otherwise
they
return
as
they
went
in
sunshine
originally
this
ghost
was
a
man
a
village
elder
of
ukami
he
was
a
great
sorcerer
one
day
people
wished
to
conquer
him
but
they
could
do
him
no
harm
for
neither
lead
nor
sword
nor
arrow
could
pierce
his
body
but
he
lived
at
strife
with
his
wife
she
said
to
his
enemies
if
you
would
kill
my
husband
i
will
tell
you
how
it
can
be
they
asked
her
how
can
it
be
done
she
answered
my
husband
is
a
great
sorcerer
you
all
know
they
answered
that
is
then
she
said
further
if
you
would
kill
him
so
that
he
dies
on
the
spot
seek
a
stalk
of
a
gourd
and
smite
him
with
it
then
he
will
die
at
once
for
that
has
always
been
to
him
a
forbidden
they
sought
the
stalk
of
a
gourd
and
when
they
smote
him
with
it
he
died
at
once
without
so
much
as
setting
one
foot
from
the
spot
but
of
him
and
his
departure
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
seen
for
suddenly
a
great
storm
blew
and
no
man
knew
whither
he
had
gone
the
storm
is
said
to
have
carried
him
to
that
cave
which
is
still
there
to
this
day
after
some
days
people
saw
in
the
cave
his
weapons
clothes
and
turban
lying
and
they
brought
word
to
the
folk
in
the
town
we
have
seen
the
clothes
of
the
elder
in
the
cave
but
of
himself
we
have
perceived
the
folk
went
thither
to
look
about
and
they
found
that
it
was
so
so
the
news
of
this
ghost
spread
all
the
more
because
people
had
seen
the
marvel
that
a
man
died
and
nobody
knew
where
he
had
gone
the
wonderful
thing
in
this
wood
is
that
the
spirits
dwell
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
and
that
everywhere
a
bright
white
sand
lies
on
the
ground
as
if
people
had
gone
thither
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
everything
clean
on
many
days
they
hear
a
drumming
and
shouts
of
joy
in
this
wood
as
if
a
marriage
feast
were
being
held
there
that
is
the
report
about
the
ghost
of
kolelo
all
village
elders
who
dwell
in
the
interior
see
in
this
ghost
the
greatest
ghost
of
all
all
the
chiefs
and
headmen
and
the
village
elders
of
the
clan
kingaru
respect
that
miss
alice
werner
who
kindly
called
my
attention
to
this
and
the
following
cases
of
african
balders
tells
me
that
this
worshipful
ghost
in
the
cave
appears
to
have
been
in
his
time
a
real
man
again
she
was
assured
by
some
natives
that
chikumbu
a
yao
chief
who
at
one
time
gave
the
administration
some
trouble
was
invulnerable
by
shot
or
steel
the
only
thing
that
could
kill
he
had
not
been
fortified
against
it
by
the
proper
a
sharp
splinter
of
bamboo
this
reminds
one
of
balder
and
the
again
a
nyanja
chief
named
chibisa
who
was
a
great
man
in
this
part
of
africa
when
livingstone
travelled
in
it
stood
firm
upon
his
while
his
men
fell
round
him
shouting
his
until
one
who
knew
the
secret
of
a
brought
him
once
more
the
swahili
tell
a
story
of
an
african
samson
named
liongo
who
lived
in
shanga
while
it
was
a
flourishing
city
by
reason
of
his
great
strength
he
oppressed
the
people
exceedingly
and
they
sought
to
kill
him
but
all
in
vain
at
last
they
bribed
his
nephew
saying
go
and
ask
your
father
what
it
is
that
will
kill
him
when
you
know
come
and
tell
us
and
when
he
is
dead
we
will
give
you
the
so
the
treacherous
nephew
went
to
his
uncle
and
asked
him
father
what
is
it
that
can
kill
you
and
his
uncle
said
a
copper
needle
if
any
one
stabs
me
in
the
navel
i
so
the
nephew
went
to
the
town
and
said
to
the
people
it
is
a
copper
needle
that
will
kill
and
they
gave
him
a
needle
and
he
went
back
to
his
uncle
and
while
his
uncle
slept
the
wicked
nephew
stabbed
him
with
the
needle
in
the
navel
so
he
died
and
they
buried
him
and
his
grave
is
to
be
seen
at
ozi
to
this
day
but
they
seized
the
nephew
and
killed
him
they
did
not
give
the
kingdom
to
that
bad
young
man
when
we
compare
the
story
of
balder
with
these
african
stories
the
heroes
of
which
were
probably
all
real
men
and
when
further
we
remember
the
similar
tale
told
of
the
persian
hero
isfendiyar
who
may
well
have
been
an
historical
personage
we
are
confirmed
in
the
suspicion
that
balder
himself
may
have
been
a
real
man
admired
and
beloved
in
his
lifetime
and
deified
after
his
death
like
the
african
sorcerer
who
is
now
worshipped
in
a
cave
and
bestows
rain
or
sunshine
on
his
votaries
on
the
whole
i
incline
to
regard
this
solution
of
the
balder
problem
as
more
probable
than
the
one
i
have
advocated
in
the
text
namely
that
balder
was
a
mythical
personification
of
a
oak
the
facts
which
seem
to
incline
the
balance
to
the
side
of
euhemerism
reached
me
as
my
book
was
going
to
press
and
too
late
to
be
embodied
in
their
proper
place
in
the
volumes
the
acceptance
of
this
hypothesis
would
not
necessarily
break
the
analogy
which
i
have
traced
between
balder
in
his
sacred
grove
on
the
sogne
fiord
of
norway
and
the
priest
of
diana
in
the
sacred
grove
of

it

certain

admitted
on

hands
the
only
doubt
that
can
arise
is
whether
the
plant
to
which
he
compares
the
mystic
bough
is
the
ordinary
species
of
mistletoe
or
the
species
known
to

as
it
is
called
by
the
people
may
be
found
by
digging
at
the
root
of
a

the
species
of
mistletoe
known
as
resembles
the
ordinary
mistletoe
in
general
appearance
but
its
berries
are
bright
yellow
instead
of
white
this
species
attacks

the

a
marked
distinction
between
the
two
sorts
of
mistletoe
is
that
whereas
ordinary
mistletoe
is
evergreen
the
is
deciduous
in
greece
the
has
been
observed
on
many
old
at
stheni
near
delphi
in
italy
it
grows
chiefly
on
the
various
species
of
oaks
and
also
on
so
familiar
is
it
on
oaks
that
it
is
known
as
oak
mistletoe
both
in
popular
parlance
and
in
druggists
shops
is
made
from
it
in
italy
both
sorts
of
mistletoe
were
known
to
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
though
the
distinctive
terms
which
they
applied
to
each
appear
not
to
be
quite
certain
theophrastus
and
pliny
after
him
seem
to
distinguish
three
sorts
of
mistletoe
to
which
theophrastus
gives
the
names
of
and
respectively
he
says
that
the
and
the
grow
on
firs
and
pines
and
that
the
grows
on
the
oak
δρῦς
the
terebinth
and
many
other
kinds
of
trees
he
also
observes
that
both
the
and
the
grow
on
the
ilex
or
πρῖνος
the
same
tree
sometimes
bearing
both
species
at
the
same
time
the
on
the
north
and
the
on
the
south
he
expressly
distinguishes
the
evergreen
species
of
from
the
deciduous
which
seems
to
prove
that
he
included
both
the
ordinary
mistletoe
and
the
under
the
general
name
of
modern
writers
are
not
agreed
as
to
the
identification
of
the
various
species
of
mistletoe
designated
by
the
names
and
wimmer
the
editor
of
theophrastus
in
the
didot
edition
takes
to
be
common
mistletoe
to
be
and
to
be
a
general
name
which
includes
the
two
species
on
the
other
hand
fraas
while
he
agrees
as
to
the
identification
of
and
with
common
mistletoe
and
respectively
inclines
somewhat
hesitatingly
to
regard
or
as
dioscorides
has
it
as
a
synonym
for
the
lenz
again
regards
both
and
as
synonyms
for
common
mistletoe
while
he
would
restrict
to
the
but
both
these
attempts
to
confine
to
the
single
deciduous
species
seem
incompatible
with
the
statement
of
theophrastus
that
includes
an
evergreen
as
well
as
a
deciduous
species
we
have
now
to
ask
did
virgil
compare
the
golden
bough
to
the
common
mistletoe
or
to
the
some
modern
enquirers
decide
in
favour
of
the
many
years
ago
sir
francis
darwin
wrote
to
me
i
wonder
whether
would
do
for
your
golden
bough
it
is
a
sort
of
mistletoe
growing
on
oaks
and
chestnuts
in
europe
in
the
autumn
it
produces
what
are
described
as
bunches
of
pretty
yellow
berries
it
is
not
evergreen
like
the
mistletoe
but
deciduous
and
as
its
leaves
appear
at
the
same
time
as
the
oak
leaves
and
drop
at
the
same
time
in
autumn
it
must
look
like
a
branch
of
the
oak
more
especially
as
it
has
rough
bark
with
lichens
often
growing
on
it
is
said
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
professor
veth
after
quoting
the
passage
from
virgil
writes
that
almost
all
translators
including
vondel
and
commentators
of
the
mantuan
bard
think
that
the
mistletoe
is
here
meant
probably
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
better
known
to
them
than
i
am
convinced
that
virgil
can
only
have
thought
of
the
latter
on
the
other
side
of
the
alps
the
is
much
commoner
than
the
mistletoe
on
account
of
its
splendid
red
blossoms
sometimes
twenty
centimetres
long
it
is
a
far
larger
and
more
conspicuous
ornament
of
the
trees
it
bears
really
golden
yellow
fruit
whereas
the
berries
of
the
mistletoe
are
almost
white
and
it
attaches
itself
by
preference
to
the
oak
whereas
the
mistletoe
is
very
seldom
found
on
the
again
paton
writes
to
me
from
mount
athos
the
oak
is
here
called
tree
as
for
the
mistletoe
there
are
two
varieties
both
called
ancient
ἰξός
both
are
used
to
make
the
real
is
the
variety
with
yellow
berries
and
no
leaves
it
is
the
parasite
of
the
oak
and
rarely
grows
on
other
trees
it
is
very
abundant
and
now
in
winter
the
which
have
adopted
it
seem
from
a
distance
to
be
draped
in
a
golden
tissue
the
other
variety
is
our
own
mistletoe
and
is
strictly
a
parasite
of
the
fir
a
spruce
fir
i
don
t
know
its
scientific
name
it
is
also
very
thus
in
favour
of
identifying
virgil
s
mistletoe
with
rather
than
with
common
mistletoe
it
has
been
urged
first
that
the
berries
of
are
bright
yellow
whereas
those
of
the
mistletoe
are
of
a
greenish
white
and
second
that
the
commonly
grows
on
oaks
whereas
mistletoe
seldom
does
so
indeed
in
italy
mistletoe
is
said
never
to
be
found
on
an
oak
both
these
circumstances
certainly
speak
strongly
in
favour
of
since
virgil
definitely
describes
the
berries
as
of
a
and
says
that
the
plant
grew
on
a
yet
on
the
other
hand
virgil
tells
us
that
the
plant
put
forth
fresh
leaves
in
the
depths
of
winter
strictly
speaking
the
cold
of
the
winter
solstice
and
this
would
best
apply
to
the
common
mistletoe
which
is
evergreen
whereas
is
deciduous
accordingly
if
we
must
decide
between
the
two
species
this
single
circumstance
appears
to
incline
the
balance
in
favour
of
common
mistletoe
but
is
it
not
possible
that
virgil
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
confused
the
two
plants
and
combined
traits
from
both
in
his
description
both
parasites
are
common
in
italy
and
in
appearance
they
are
much
alike
except
for
the
colour
of
the
berries
as
a
loving
observer
of
nature
virgil
was
probably
familiar
by
sight
with
both
but
he
may
not
have
examined
them
closely
and
he
might
be
excused
if
he
thought
that
the
parasite
which
he
saw
growing
with
its
clusters
of
bright
yellow
berries
on
oaks
in
winter
was
identical
with
the
similar
parasite
which
he
saw
growing
with
its
bunches
of
greenish
white
berries
and
its
pale
green
leaves
on
many
other
trees
of
the
forest
the
confusion
would
be
all
the
more
natural
if
the
celts
of
northern
italy
in
whose
country
the
poet
was
born
resembled
the
modern
celts
of
brittany
in
attaching
bunches
of
the
common
mistletoe
to
their
cottages
and
leaving
them
there
till
the
revolving
months
had
tinged
the
pale
berries
leaves
and
twigs
with
a
golden
yellow

the
ceremony
has
been
described
to
me

ernest
foxwell
of
john
s
college
cambridge
and
miss
hughes
formerly
principal
of
the
teachers
training
college
cambridge
foxwell
examined
the
feet
of
the
performers
both
before
and
after
their
passage
through
the
fire
and
found
no
hurt
the
heat
was
so
great
that
the
sweat
ran
down
him
as
he
stood
near
the
bed
of
glowing
charcoal
he
can
not
explain
the
immunity
of
the
performers
he
informs
me
that
the
american
writer
percival
lowell
walked
in
the
fire
and
was
burned
so
severely
that
he
was
laid
up
in
bed
for
three
weeks
while
on
the
other
hand
a
scotch
engineer
named
hillhouse
passed
over
the
hot
charcoal
unscathed
several
of
miss
hughes
s
japanese
pupils
also
went
through
the
ordeal
with
impunity
but
one
of
them
burned
a
toe
both
before
and
after
walking
through
the
fire
the
people
dipped
their
feet
in
a
white
stuff
which
miss
hughes
was
told
was
salt

i
can
not

observe
that
the
notion
of
witchcraft
reigns
very
much
in

i
have
often
been
tired
with
accounts
of
this
nature
from
very
sensible
men
who
are
most
of
them
furnished
with
matters
of
fact
which
have
happened
as
they
pretend
within
the
compass
of
their
own
knowledge
it
is
certain
there
have
been
many
executions
on
this
account
as
in
the
canton
of
berne
there
were
some
put
to
death
during
my
stay
at
geneva
the
people
are
so
universally
infatuated
with
the
notion
that
if
a
cow
falls
sick
it
is
ten
to
one
but
an
old
woman
is
clapt
up
in
prison
for
it
and
if
the
poor
creature
chance
to
think
herself
a
witch

whole

which
like
the

was
essentially
a
worship
or
perhaps
rather
a
conjuration
of
the
sacred
oak
whether
any
deeper
affinity
based
on

aryan
descent
may

that

it

that
at

the
only
wood
that
might

was
the

it

that
herein
zeus
who
was

intruder
at

merely
accepted
an
old
local
custom
which
long
before

arrival
had
been
observed

may
observe

more
common
than
it
is

the
afterbirth
is
similarly
regarded
as
a
sort
of
human
being
hence
when
twins
are
born
the
people
speak
of
four
children

reckoning

the
conception
of
the
afterbirth
and
as
spiritual
doubles
of
the
child
with
whom
they
are
born
is
held
very
firmly
by
the
kooboos
a
primitive
tribe
of
sumatra
we
are
told
that
among
these
people
a
great
vital
power
is
ascribed
to
the
and
afterbirth
because
they
are
looked
upon
as
brother
or
sister
of
the
infant
and
though
their
bodies
have
not
come
to
perfection
yet
their
soul
and
spirit
are
just
as
normal
as
those
of
the
child
and
indeed
have
even
reached
a
much
higher
stage
of
development
the
and
afterbirth
visit
the
man
who
was
born
with
them
thrice
a
day
and
thrice
by
night
till
his
death
or
they
hover
near
him
voorbij
hem
they
are
the
good
spirits
a
sort
of
guardian
angels
of
the
man
who
came
into
the
world
with
them
and
who
lives
on
earth
they
are
said
to
guard
him
from
all
evil
hence
it
is
that
the
kooboo
always
thinks
of
his
and
afterbirth
before
he
goes
to
sleep
or
to
work
or
undertakes
a
journey
and
so
on
merely
to
think
of
them
is
enough
there
is
no
need
to
invoke
them
or
to
ask
them
anything
or
to
entreat
them
by
not
thinking
of
them
a
man
deprives
himself
of
their
good
immediately
after
the
birth
the
and
afterbirth
are
buried
in
the
ground
close
by
the
spot
where
the
birth
took
place
and
a
ceremony
is
performed
over
it
for
were
the
ceremony
omitted
the
and
afterbirth
instead
of
being
a
good
spirit
for
the
newly
born
child
might
become
an
evil
spirit
for
him
and
visit
him
with
all
sorts
of
calamities
out
of
spite
for
this
the
nature
of
the
ceremony
performed
over
the
spot
is
not
described
by
our
authority
the
and
afterbirth
are
often
regarded
by
the
kooboos
as
one

are
always
mentioned

the
whole
subject
of
passing
sick
people
through
narrow
apertures
as
a
mode
of
cure
has
been
well
handled
in
an
elegant
little
monograph
vieux
rite
paris
by
monsieur
gaidoz
who
rightly
rejects
the
theory
that
all
such
passages
are
symbols
of
a
new
birth
but
i
can
not
agree
with
him
in
thinking
that
the
essence
of
the
rite
consists
in
the
transference
of
the
disease
from
the
person
to
the
tree
rather
it
seems
to
me
the
primary
idea
is
that
of
interposing
an
impassable
barrier
between
a
fugitive
and
his
pursuing
foe
though
no
doubt
the
enemy
thus
left
behind
is
apparently
supposed
to
adhere
to
the
further
side
of
the
obstacle
whether
tree
stone
or
what
not
through
which
he
can
not
pass
however
the
sympathetic
relation
supposed
to
exist
between
the
sufferer
and
the
tree
through
which
he
has
been
passed
certainly
favours
the
view
that
he
has
left
some
portion
of
himself
attached
to
the
tree
but
in
this
as
in
many
similar
cases
the
ideas
in
the
minds
of
the
persons
who
practise
the
custom
are
probably
vague
confused
and
inconsistent
and
we
need
not
attempt
to
define
them

by
itself

out

striking
part

the
structure
consists

upright
corinthian
pillars

architrave

horizontally

ingeniously
conjectures

we
have
here
a
reminiscence

the
two
uprights

which

our
theory

correct
was
the
original
form

of

it
is
very
remarkable
that
among

these
fights
had
a
special
connexion
with

taking
wives

go
out

kill

brother
then
returning
to

camp
they
shewed
the
dead
bird
to
the

the
result
was
a
fight
between
the
young
men
and
the
young
women
in
which
however
lads
who
were
not
yet
marriageable
might
not
take
part
next
day
the
marriageable
young
men
went
out
and
killed
a
superb
warbler
which
was
the
women
s
sister
and
this
led
to
a
worse
fight
than
before
some
days
afterwards
when
the
wounds
and
bruises
were
healed
one
of
the
marriageable
young
men
met
one
of
the
marriageable
young
women
and
said
superb
warbler
she
answered
what
does

eat
to
which
the

answered
he
eats
naming

the
following
suggestion
as
to
the
origin
of
totemism
was
made
in
the
first
edition
of
this
book
published
in
and
is
here
reprinted
without
any
substantial
change
in
the
meantime
much
additional
evidence
as
to
the
nature
and
prevalence
of
totemism
has
come
to
light
and
with
the
new
evidence
my
opinions
or
rather
conjectures
as
to
the
origin
of
the
institution
have
repeatedly
changed
if
i
here
reprint
my
earliest
conjecture
it
is
partly
because
i
still
think
it
may
contain
an
element
of
truth
and
partly
because
it
serves
as
a
convenient
peg
on
which
to
hang
a
collection
of
facts
which
are
much
more
valuable
than
any
theories
of
mine
the
reader
who
desires
to
acquaint
himself
more
fully
with
the
facts
of
totemism
and
with
the
theories
that
have
been
broached
on
the
subject
will
find
them
stated
at
length
in
my
and
london
here
i
will
only
call
attention
to
the
arunta
legend
that
the
ancestors
of
the
tribe
kept
their
spirits
in
certain
sacred
sticks
and
stones
which
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
the
and
that
when
they
went
out
hunting
they
hung
these
sticks
or
stones
on
certain
sacred
poles
which
represented
their
totems
see
baldwin
spencer
and
gillen
tribes
of
central
london
pp
this
tradition
appears
to
point
to
a
custom
of
transferring
a
man
s
soul
or
spirit
temporarily
to
his
totem
conversely
when
an
arunta
is
sick
he
scrapes
his
and
swallows
the
scrapings
as
if
to
restore
to
himself
the
spiritual
substance
deposited
in
the
instrument
see
baldwin
spencer
and
gillen
note
sex
totems
and
clan
totems
may
both
be
based
on
the
notion
that
men
and
women
keep
their
external
souls
in
their
totems

these
are
animals
plants
or
what
not

ii
fison

howitt

according
to
howitt
it
is
a
serious
offence
to
kill
the
totem
of
another
person
with
intent
to
injure
him
of
the
anthropological

such
an
intention
seems
to
imply
a
belief
in
a
sympathetic
connexion
between
the
man
and
the
animal
similarly
the
siena
of
the
ivory
coast
in

have
totemism
believe

if
a
man
kills

of

a

imagine

if

the

an
important
institution
among
some
of
the
ibans
which
occurs
but
in
rare
instances
among
the
other
peoples
is
the
or
secret
helper
the
is
one
of
the
very
few
topics
in
regard
to
which
the
ibans
display
any
reluctance
to
speak
freely
so
great
is
their
reserve
in
this
connection
that
one
of
us
lived
for
fourteen
years
on
friendly
terms
with
ibans
of
various
districts
without
ascertaining
the
meaning
of
the
word
or
suspecting
the
great
importance
of
the
part
played
by
the
notion
in
the
lives
of
some
of
these
people
the
seems
to
be
usually
the
spirit
of
some
ancestor
or
dead
relative
but
not
always
so
and
it
is
not
clear
that
it
is
always
conceived
as
the
spirit
of
a
deceased
human
being
this
spirit
becomes
the
special
protector
of
some
individual
iban
to
whom
in
a
dream
he
manifests
himself
in
the
first
place
in
human
form
and
announces
that
he
will
be
his
secret
helper
when
as
is
most
commonly
the
case
the
secret
helper
takes
on
the
form
of
some
animal
all
individuals
of
that
species
become
objects
of
especial
regard
to
the
fortunate
iban
he
will
not
kill
or
eat
any
such
animal
and
he
will
as
far
as
possible
restrain
others
from
doing
thus
the
or
secret
helper
of
the
ibans
closely
resembles
what
i
have
called
the
individual
or
personal
totem
it
is
not
merely
the
personal
name
which
is
often
shrouded
in
mystery
see
and
the
perils
of
the
pp
the
names
of
the
clans
and
their
subdivisions
are
objects
of
mysterious
reverence
among
many
if
not
all
of
the
siouan
tribes
of
north
america

are
never

the
totem
name
was
called
and
it
was
said
to
be
more
like
or
magic
than
a
name
and
it
was
in
one
sense
a
secret
name
for
with
it
an
enemy
might
cause
injury
to
its
bearer
by
magic
thus
very
few
people
knew
the
totem
names
of
others
the
name
being
told
to
a
youth
by
his
father
at
his

this
view
of
totemism
may
help
to
explain
the

of
death

ceremonies

similarly
a
man
of

kulin
tribe
in

was
called

because
the
spirit
of
a
native
bear
was
supposed
to
have
entered
into
him
when
he
killed
the
animal

to
have
endowed
him

wonderful
cleverness

we
have
seen
pp
that
the
indians
of
honduras
made
an
alliance
with
the
animal
that
was
to
be
their
by
offering
some
of
their
own
blood
to
it
conversely
the
north
american
indian
kills
the
animal
which
is
to
be
his
personal
totem
and
thenceforth
wears
some
part
of
the
creature
as
an
amulet

these
facts
seem
to
point
to
the
establishment
of
a

interchange

the
phrase

one
of

mr
basil

questions
the
accuracy
of
fison
s
account
of
this
vicarious
sacrifice
on
the
ground
that
every
youth
was
regularly
circumcised
as
a
matter
of
course
but
there
seems
to
be
no
inconsistency
between
the
two
statements
while
custom
required
that
every
youth
should
be
circumcised
the
exact
time
for
performing
the
ceremony
need
not
have
been
rigidly
prescribed
and
if
a
saving
or
atoning
virtue
was
attributed
to
the
sacrifice
of
foreskins
it
might
be
thought
desirable
in
cases
of
emergency
such
as
serious
illness
to
anticipate
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
sufferer
according
to
fison
the
enclosure
was
divided
into
three
compartments
mr
basil
thomson
describes
only
two
though
by
speaking
of
one
of
them
as
the

he
seems
to
imply
that
there
were
three

was

according
to
fison
the
initiatory
ceremonies
were
held
as
a
rule
only
every
second
year
but
he
adds
this
period
however
is
not
necessarily
restricted
to
two
years
there
are
always
a
number
of
youths
who
are
growing
to
the
proper
age
and
the
length
of
the
interval
depends
upon
the
decision
of
the
perhaps
the
seeming
discrepancy
between
our
authorities
on
this
point
may
be
explained
by
joske
s
statement
that
the
rites
are
held
in
alternate
years
by
two
different
sets
of
men
the
kai
vesina
and
the
kai

of
whom
claim
to
be
descended
from
the
original
founders
of

custom
of

character

says

the
appearance
of
the

spirit
was
considered
a
matter
of
great
importance

any
failure
which
disclosed
the
deception
to
the
uninitiated
was
deemed
a
grave
misfortune
which
could
only
be
atoned
for
by
the
death
of

persons
concerned

to
be
killed

a
man

restored

this
is

opinion

writes
the
close
similarity
between

those
of

the

to
apply
the

argument
to
the
consideration
of
the
growth
of

lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the

psychical
factor
that
molded
the

present
shape
molded

the
mistletoe
s
favourite
tree
is
certainly
the
black
poplar
it
flourishes
with
astonishing
luxuriance
on
the
branches
of
that
tree
mistletoe
has
also
been
found
by

of

upon

sir

darwin
writes
to
me
i
do
not
quite
see
why
should
not
put
out
leaves
in
winter
as
easily
as
in
both
cases
it
would
be
due
to
unfolding
leaf
buds
the
fact
that
has
adult
leaves
at
the
time
while
has
not
does
not
really
affect
the
however
paton
tells
us
as
we
have
just
seen
that
in
winter
the
growing
on
the
oaks
of
mount
athos
has
no
leaves
though
its
yellow
berries
are
very
conspicuous
