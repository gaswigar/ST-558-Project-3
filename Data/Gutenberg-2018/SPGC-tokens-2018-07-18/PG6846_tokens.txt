my
lady
of

my
lady
of
the
north
the
love
story
of
a
chapter
i
a
despatch
for
longstreet
it
was
a
bare
plain
interior
the
low
table
at
which
he
sat
an
unplaned
board
his
seat
a
box
made
softer
by
a
folded
blanket
his
only
companions
were
two
aides
standing
silent
beside
the
closed
entrance
anxious
to
anticipate
his
slightest
need
he
will
abide
in
my
memory
forever
as
i
saw
him
then
although
we
were
destined
to
meet
often
afterwards
that
old
gray
hero
whose
masterly
strategy
held
at
bay
for
so
long
those
mighty
forces
hurled
on
our
constantly
thinning
lines
of
defence
to
me
the
history
of
war
has
never
contained
his
equal
and
while
i
live
i
shall
love
and
revere
him
as
i
can
love
and
revere
no
other
man
general
lee
said
one
of
the
aides
as
i
passed
the
single
sentry
and
drew
aside
the
flap
to
step
within
this
is
captain
he
deliberately
pushed
aside
the
mass
of
papers
which
had
been
engaging
him
and
for
an
embarrassing
moment
fixed
upon
me
a
glance
that
seemed
to
read
me
through
and
through
then
with
simple
dignity
far
more
impressive
than
i
can
picture
it
in
words
he
arose
slowly
and
extended
his
hand
captain
wayne
he
said
gravely
yet
retaining
his
grasp
and
with
his
eyes
full
upon
mine
you
are
a
much
younger
man
than
i
expected
to
see
yet
i
have
selected
you
upon
the
special
recommendation
of
your
brigade
commander
for
services
of
the
utmost
importance
i
certainly
do
not
hold
your
youth
to
be
against
your
success
but
i
feel
unwilling
to
order
you
to
the
performance
of
this
duty
which
besides
being
beyond
the
regular
requirements
of
the
service
involves
unusual
without
inquiring
its
nature
i
said
hastily
i
freely
offer
myself
a
volunteer
for
any
service
which
may
be
required
either
by
the
army
or
the
kindly
face
brightened
instantly
almost
into
a
smile
and
a
new
look
of
confidence
swept
into
the
keen
gray
eyes
i
felt
even
as
i
spoke
he
said
with
a
dignified
courtesy
i
have
never
marked
in
any
one
else
that
i
must
be
doing
wrong
to
question
the
willingness
of
an
officer
of
your
regiment
captain
wayne
to
make
personal
sacrifice
from
our
first
day
of
battle
until
now
the
south
has
never
once
called
upon
them
in
vain
you
are
from
the
ranks
i
believe
i
was
a
corporal
at
ah
then
you
have
won
your
grade
by
hard
service
you
take
with
you
one
man
sergeant
craig
of
my
troop
sir
a
good
soldier
who
knows
the
country
he
lowered
his
eyes
to
the
numerous
papers
littering
the
table
and
then
leaning
over
traced
lightly
with
a
colored
pencil
a
line
across
an
outspread
map
you
speak
of
his
knowing
the
country
well
are
you
aware
then
of
your
destination
i
merely
inferred
from
what
colonel
carter
said
that
it
was
your
desire
to
communication
with
general
that
is
true
but
do
you
know
where
longstreet
is
only
that
we
of
the
line
suppose
him
to
be
somewhere
west
of
the
mountains
sir
it
is
camp
gossip
that
his
present
base
of
supplies
is
at
your
conjecture
is
partly
correct
although
i
have
more
reason
to
believe
that
the
head
of
his
column
has
reached
bear
fork
or
will
by
morning
kindly
step
this
way
captain
wayne
and
make
note
of
the
blue
lines
i
have
traced
across
this
map
here
you
will
observe
is
minersville
directly
beyond
the
high
ridge
you
will
notice
that
the
federal
lines
extend
north
and
south
directly
between
us
with
their
heavier
bodies
of
infantry
along
the
wharton
pike
and
so
disposed
as
to
shut
off
all
communication
between
us
and
our
left
wing
now
the
message
i
must
get
into
longstreet
hands
is
imperative
indeed
i
will
say
to
you
the
very
safety
of
this
army
depends
upon
its
reaching
him
before
his
advance
passes
bear
fork
there
remains
therefore
no
time
for
any
long
detour
the
messenger
who
bears
it
must
take
his
life
in
his
hands
and
ride
straight
westward
through
the
very
lines
of
the
he
spoke
these
words
rapidly
earnestly
then
suddenly
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
mine
and
said
firmly
i
am
perfectly
frank
with
you
are
you
the
man
i
felt
the
hot
blood
leap
into
my
face
but
i
met
his
stern
gaze
without
flinching
if
i
live
general
lee
i
shall
meet
his
advance
at
bear
fork
by
god
guide
you
i
believe
you
his
words
seemed
uttered
unconsciously
he
turned
slightly
and
glanced
toward
the
door
major
holmes
will
you
kindly
hand
me
the
draft
of
that
despatch
he
took
the
paper
from
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
aide
read
it
over
slowly
and
with
great
care
wrote
a
word
of
explanation
upon
the
margin
and
then
extended
it
to
me
commit
that
word
by
word
to
your
memory
we
must
run
no
possible
risk
of
its
ever
falling
into
the
enemy
i
can
see
it
now
that
coarse
yellow
paper
the
clear
upright
penmanship
the
words
here
and
there
misused
and
corrected
the
sentence
scratched
out
the
heavy
underlining
of
a
command
and
his
own
strangely
delicate
signature
at
the
bottom
headquarters
army
northern
virginia
in
the
field
near
custer
house
sept
longstreet
commanding
left
wing
sir
you
will
advance
your
entire
force
by
the
connelton
and
sheffield
pikes
so
as
to
reach
castle
rock
with
your
full
infantry
command
by
daybreak
september
let
this
supersede
all
other
orders
i
propose
to
attack
in
force
in
the
neighborhood
of
sailor
ford
and
shall
expect
you
to
advance
promptly
at
the
first
sound
of
our
artillery
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
we
form
prompt
connection
of
forces
and
to
accomplish
this
result
will
require
a
quick
persistent
attack
upon
your
part
you
are
hereby
ordered
to
throw
your
troops
forward
without
reserve
permitting
them
to
be
halted
by
no
obstacle
until
they
come
into
actual
touch
with
my
columns
the
success
or
failure
of
my
plans
will
depend
utterly
upon
your
strict
observance
of
these
r
lee
commanding
i
handed
back
the
paper
and
lifted
my
hand
in
salute
you
have
memorized
it
word
for
word
repeat
it
to
he
held
the
paper
before
him
as
i
did
so
and
at
the
close
lifted
his
eyes
again
to
my
face
very
good
he
said
quietly
now
let
there
be
no
mistake
repeat
it
over
to
your
companion
as
you
proceed
until
he
also
has
memorized
it
and
one
of
you
must
live
long
enough
to
reach
longstreet
i
advise
you
to
take
the
langley
road
it
is
the
most
protected
and
not
try
to
pass
beyond
the
old
coulter
plantation
until
after
dark
or
you
will
run
the
risk
of
being
observed
by
the
enemy
pickets
beyond
this
i
must
leave
all
to
your
own
he
paused
and
i
still
lingered
thinking
he
might
have
something
more
to
add
are
you
one
of
the
waynes
of
charlottesville
he
asked
gravely
colonel
richard
wayne
was
my
father
ah
indeed
i
remember
him
well
and
his
face
lit
up
with
a
most
tender
smile
we
were
together
in
mexico
a
virginia
gentleman
of
the
old
school
he
is
dead
i
believe
he
was
killed
sir
the
first
year
of
the
i
remember
it
was
at
antietam
and
your
mother
if
my
memory
is
not
at
fault
she
was
a
pierpont
she
is
now
in
richmond
sir
and
the
old
plantation
is
but
a
war
is
indeed
sad
he
said
slowly
and
i
often
feel
that
our
southern
women
are
compelled
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
what
heroines
they
have
proven
history
records
no
equal
to
the
daily
sacrifices
i
have
witnessed
in
the
past
three
years
god
grant
it
may
be
soon
then
as
if
suddenly
moved
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
again
extended
his
hand
well
lad
he
said
kindly
the
same
grave
smile
lighting
his
face
our
country
needs
us
we
must
not
waste
time
here
in
conversation
i
am
very
glad
to
have
been
permitted
to
meet
the
son
of
my
old
friend
and
trust
you
will
remember
me
to
your
mother
but
now
captain
and
may
he
in
whose
hand
we
all
are
guide
and
guard
you
i
know
that
a
wayne
of
virginia
will
always
do
his
bareheaded
and
with
proudly
swelling
heart
i
backed
out
of
the
tent
as
i
might
have
left
the
of
an
emperor
but
as
i
grasped
the
reins
and
swung
up
into
saddle
i
became
conscious
that
he
had
followed
me
craig
flung
up
his
hand
in
quick
soldierly
salute
and
then
with
a
single
rapid
stride
the
general
stood
at
his
horse
head
sergeant
he
said
and
i
was
struck
by
the
incisive
military
tone
of
his
voice
so
different
from
the
gentleness
shown
within
i
am
informed
that
you
are
intimately
acquainted
with
the
roads
to
the
every
sir
either
by
night
or
then
possibly
you
can
inform
me
whether
the
big
hickory
is
fordable
at
deer
not
for
infantry
at
high
water
sir
but
there
is
another
ford
two
miles
north
where
it
is
never
over
waist
that
would
be
at
brixton
mill
no
sir
the
other
lee
smiled
and
rested
his
hand
almost
caressingly
on
the
knee
you
are
a
valuable
man
for
us
to
risk
on
such
a
ride
he
said
kindly
but
i
desire
you
to
understand
sergeant
how
deeply
i
value
the
service
you
are
about
to
render
and
that
i
shall
never
permit
it
to
be
forgotten
or
go
unrewarded
and
now
sergeant
captain
as
we
turned
into
the
main
road
riding
slowly
i
glanced
backward
the
general
was
yet
standing
there
in
front
of
his
tent
gazing
after
us
the
rays
of
the
westering
sun
gleaming
on
his
gray
hair
chapter
ii
the
night
ride
by
five
we
were
safe
at
colchester
and
while
our
horses
rested
and
refreshed
themselves
on
some
confiscated
grain
the
two
of
us
lay
lazily
back
on
a
grassy
knoll
well
within
the
shadow
of
a
ruined
wall
and
watched
the
round
red
sun
drop
slowly
down
behind
those
western
hills
we
had
to
climb
we
scarcely
spoke
regarding
the
work
we
knew
was
ahead
except
to
discuss
briefly
the
better
route
to
be
selected
for
our
hard
ride
we
were
both
old
campaigners
inured
by
years
of
discipline
to
danger
and
obedience
this
special
duty
however
arduous
and
desperate
it
might
prove
to
be
was
silently
accepted
as
part
of
the
service
we
owed
the
state
reckless
and
hardened
as
i
know
craig
to
have
been
i
have
no
doubt
he
reflected
upon
lee
and
his
kindly
words
and
was
touched
and
softened
by
their
memory
as
he
lay
there
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
grass
his
pipe
glowing
cheerily
between
his
lips
but
if
so
his
thoughts
remained
unuttered
nor
did
i
feel
inclined
to
dwell
upon
the
theme
and
so
in
the
strength
of
a
simple
comradeship
which
could
remain
silent
we
waited
patiently
for
the
night
to
close
us
in
as
early
as
we
deemed
it
safe
to
venture
we
were
again
in
saddle
riding
now
straight
to
the
westward
along
the
pike
until
we
caught
sight
of
the
black
shadow
of
colton
church
in
our
front
then
we
swerved
to
the
left
and
still
moving
rapidly
but
with
considerate
care
for
the
horses
headed
directly
across
the
more
broken
country
toward
the
it
proved
to
be
a
hard
toilsome
climb
up
those
long
steep
slopes
rising
before
us
for
we
were
extremely
careful
now
to
keep
well
away
from
every
known
route
of
travel
and
our
horses
although
selected
from
among
the
best
mounts
of
the
cavalry
brigade
had
already
been
thoroughly
winded
by
their
smart
trot
up
the
valley
the
short
grass
under
foot
crisp
from
the
hot
sun
of
the
long
afternoon
caused
many
a
slip
of
the
poorly
shod
hoofs
while
the
darkness
had
grown
so
close
and
dense
about
us
that
we
could
barely
creep
through
it
with
only
faith
and
a
doubtful
memory
as
guides
every
road
we
well
knew
would
be
patrolled
by
federal
pickets
only
the
broken
country
between
could
yield
us
the
faintest
prospect
of
success
but
at
best
it
must
largely
be
guesswork
providence
luck
what
you
will
and
the
slightest
swing
of
the
pendulum
could
easily
frustrate
our
best
laid
plans
an
hour
of
this
work
passed
whether
or
not
we
were
yet
within
the
enemy
lines
was
largely
conjecture
for
no
human
eye
could
pierce
the
enveloping
gloom
and
no
sound
either
of
warning
or
encouragement
reached
us
as
we
strained
our
ears
the
sergeant
rode
slightly
in
advance
as
we
toiled
up
the
higher
terrace
for
our
sole
dependence
as
to
direction
and
distance
was
upon
his
memory
and
even
that
could
scarcely
serve
for
much
on
such
a
night
as
this
i
traced
his
passage
upward
as
best
i
might
and
pressed
close
after
him
guided
not
so
much
by
sight
as
by
sound
the
occasional
rolling
of
a
loosened
stone
the
rustling
of
leaves
as
he
touched
a
bush
in
passage
the
faint
clinking
of
his
sabre
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
his
horse
until
at
last
his
long
slender
figure
rose
sufficiently
above
the
dark
hill
surface
to
be
faintly
silhouetted
in
deeper
shadow
against
the
dim
reflection
of
the
upper
sky
almost
coincidently
with
this
my
horse
ranged
up
beside
his
where
he
had
drawn
rein
in
evident
perplexity
what
is
it
dan
i
questioned
cautiously
for
all
i
could
feel
reasonably
assured
of
just
then
was
that
behind
any
rock
or
tree
in
our
front
there
might
be
crouching
a
federal
picket
it
nothing
cap
he
answered
quietly
turning
his
face
toward
me
as
he
spoke
i
just
tryin
ter
some
landmark
yereabout
ter
guide
from
blamed
if
ever
i
see
such
a
dark
night
it
like
bein
inside
a
pocket
sir
an
i
reckon
as
how
it
must
be
nigh
onter
ten
year
since
i
run
loose
in
this
yere
country
as
a
kid
thet
thar
we
took
a
while
back
has
sort
o
confused
me
that
a
fac
and
i
do
just
know
whar
i
am
but
i
reckon
as
how
the
main
ridge
road
we
a
after
oughter
run
somewhar
out
he
pointed
forward
into
the
night
i
supposed
from
the
map
it
would
be
found
farther
back
and
considerably
to
the
right
of
us
i
ventured
doubtfully
never
saw
no
map
cap
he
returned
with
the
easy
familiarity
of
a
scout
on
service
but
if
i
recollect
clear
it
sure
used
ter
run
mighty
close
ter
the
east
edge
i
reckon
it
ai
changed
none
to
speak
of
so
it
have
ter
be
somewhere
just
along
he
spoke
with
such
an
air
of
certainty
that
i
felt
any
controversy
useless
very
well
hand
me
your
rein
and
see
what
you
can
discover
out
there
on
foot
sitting
here
is
apt
to
mend
matters
and
we
surely
can
not
afford
to
cripple
our
horses
among
those
the
sergeant
a
gaunt
tireless
mountaineer
slipped
silently
from
his
saddle
swung
his
light
cavalry
carbine
from
his
back
to
the
hollow
of
his
arm
and
in
another
moment
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
darkness
a
snake
could
not
have
slipped
away
more
stealthily
i
heard
a
stone
rattle
under
his
foot
a
oath
and
then
the
night
had
completely
swallowed
him
how
utterly
alone
i
seemed
how
intensely
painfully
still
everything
was
the
silence
felt
almost
like
a
weight
so
greatly
it
oppressed
me
even
the
accustomed
voices
of
nature
were
hushed
as
if
war
with
its
unspeakable
cruelty
had
cast
a
spell
over
all
things
animate
and
inanimate
it
was
weird
uncanny
with
every
nerve
strained
i
leaned
forward
across
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
out
in
that
black
void
my
head
burned
and
throbbed
as
with
fever
and
i
felt
that
strange
unnatural
stillness
as
though
it
had
been
a
physical
thing
surely
others
besides
us
were
upon
this
hilltop
for
i
knew
well
my
every
soldier
instinct
told
me
that
somewhere
out
in
that
impenetrable
mystery
were
blazing
the
of
an
enemy
vigilant
eyes
were
peering
everywhere
in
search
for
such
as
we
how
far
away
they
might
lurk
i
could
not
even
conjecture
perhaps
merely
around
some
near
projecting
wall
of
rock
and
we
might
even
now
be
within
the
range
of
their
ready
rifles
i
could
hear
the
quickened
throbbing
of
my
heart
and
my
hand
fell
heavily
on
a
pistol
butt
in
nervous
expectancy
the
soft
night
wind
heavy
with
pine
odors
began
suddenly
to
play
amid
the
leaves
of
a
low
tree
beside
me
and
the
pleasant
rustling
mingled
like
strains
of
music
with
the
slow
breathing
of
the
horses
but
no
other
sound
broke
a
silence
that
had
become
a
positive
pain
man
at
his
best
is
largely
a
creature
of
impulse
and
i
confess
to
a
feeling
almost
of
terror
as
i
sat
there
in
utter
loneliness
i
glanced
behind
hoping
that
there
at
least
i
might
discover
some
object
on
which
my
gaze
might
settle
something
that
would
relieve
the
intense
of
the
black
nothingness
i
swept
with
staring
eyes
the
half
circle
where
i
knew
must
lie
the
deep
wide
valley
far
beneath
but
no
welcome
gleam
of
light
greeted
me
far
out
yonder
as
i
well
knew
was
the
cheery
glow
where
our
ragged
tired
comrades
rested
around
their
night
fires
but
the
bend
of
the
land
between
shut
it
all
off
as
completely
as
if
i
were
already
in
another
world
a
denizen
of
those
cold
and
silent
stars
so
far
away
i
recall
it
now
as
one
of
the
loneliest
moments
of
my
life
one
of
those
almost
unaccountable
conditions
of
mind
and
body
when
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
thin
sinewy
fingers
of
an
inexorable
fate
were
closing
down
with
a
pressure
which
no
strength
of
man
might
resist
i
was
worn
with
fatigue
in
the
saddle
but
did
not
dream
of
sleep
my
mind
in
a
firm
endeavor
to
cast
aside
the
uncanny
influences
of
the
hour
recalled
in
swift
panorama
those
three
years
of
civil
strife
which
had
run
their
course
since
i
a
slender
lad
had
stolen
forth
into
the
moonlight
from
the
portals
of
the
old
home
to
ride
away
into
the
northward
where
the
throbbing
drums
called
me
in
those
days
i
understood
but
little
of
the
cause
for
which
i
was
so
eager
to
fight
and
suffer
possibly
i
cared
even
less
yet
i
had
ever
since
blindly
followed
the
faded
tattered
flag
of
my
native
state
with
the
same
passionate
devotion
that
possessed
thousands
of
others
and
with
no
clearer
thought
than
to
remain
beside
it
to
the
bitter
end
what
strange
exciting
years
those
had
been
how
filled
with
adventure
like
pictures
painted
on
a
screen
there
flashed
across
my
memory
in
vivid
colors
the
camps
and
marches
the
long
night
vigils
the
swift
sweep
of
the
charging
squadrons
the
deadly
shock
of
battle
the
scouting
across
unknown
country
the
hours
of
pain
while
the
soft
moon
smiled
down
upon
a
stricken
field
the
weary
weeks
in
the
hospital
at
richmond
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
i
could
be
that
same
slender
untried
lad
who
stole
forth
with
quaking
heart
fearful
of
the
very
shadows
of
the
oaks
about
the
old
home
what
centuries
of
experience
lay
between
the
same
boy
yet
moulded
now
into
a
man
into
the
leader
of
a
troop
of
fighting
men
hardened
to
steel
by
service
trusted
by
one
whom
the
south
most
revered
and
loved
a
veteran
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
hardest
fighting
legions
our
world
has
ever
known
yet
such
had
been
the
magic
touch
of
war
so
deeply
had
my
every
thought
become
merged
in
these
musings
that
craig
slipping
silently
as
a
ghost
from
out
the
engulfing
darkness
laid
hand
upon
my
before
i
became
aware
of
his
approach
i
got
all
right
now
cap
he
announced
quietly
peering
up
into
my
face
we
uns
are
not
more
nor
a
hundred
yards
ter
the
right
of
the
road
but
i
reckon
you
find
ther
way
a
bit
he
led
both
horses
forward
moving
slowly
and
with
that
silent
caution
so
characteristic
of
his
class
with
scarcely
the
scraping
of
a
hoof
on
the
flinty
rocks
we
came
forth
in
safety
upon
the
defined
track
the
south
is
over
yonder
ter
the
left
he
whispered
as
he
swung
up
into
saddle
an
the
trend
of
the
road
is
mighty
nigh
due
but
in
which
direction
does
their
main
camp
lie
sergeant
he
shook
his
head
gravely
durn
it
thet
just
what
i
ca
quite
figure
out
sir
whether
we
uns
be
to
ther
north
or
south
of
ther
white
church
then
somehow
or
other
it
seems
like
to
me
as
if
this
yere
road
lay
a
bit
too
close
ter
the
edge
of
ther
plateau
ter
ever
be
the
main
pike
what
the
feds
marched
over
i
reckon
from
ther
direction
it
runs
that
maybe
it
might
be
a
branch
like
or
a
leadin
inter
the
other
if
thet
the
way
it
is
then
them
fellers
we
uns
is
tryin
ter
dodge
ought
ter
be
down
yonder
ter
the
left
i
gazed
vaguely
out
into
the
black
vacancy
to
which
he
pointed
well
if
we
should
chance
to
run
up
against
one
of
their
picket
posts
we
shall
be
soon
enlightened
i
returned
urging
my
horse
carefully
forward
but
we
shall
have
to
take
the
chances
for
it
would
not
prove
healthy
for
either
of
us
to
be
caught
here
by
i
heard
craig
chuckle
grimly
to
himself
as
if
he
found
humor
in
the
thought
but
without
other
attempt
to
give
utterance
to
his
feelings
he
ranged
up
close
to
my
side
not
daring
to
venture
on
any
gait
faster
than
a
walk
along
this
unknown
and
mountain
trail
we
slowly
and
cautiously
worked
our
way
forward
for
more
than
an
hour
meeting
with
no
human
obstacle
to
our
progress
yet
feeling
that
each
step
forward
was
surrounded
by
imminent
peril
that
we
were
now
well
within
the
guarded
lines
of
the
enemy
we
were
both
assured
although
where
or
how
we
had
succeeded
in
penetrating
the
cordon
of
picket
posts
unobserved
we
could
only
conjecture
the
darkness
about
us
seemed
intensified
by
the
high
overhanging
bank
of
rock
at
our
left
on
the
other
side
and
but
dimly
revealed
against
the
i
could
perceive
craig
gaunt
figure
as
he
leaned
far
over
the
high
pommel
of
his
cavalry
saddle
his
short
carbine
well
advanced
his
trained
eyes
seeking
vainly
to
pierce
the
mystery
in
our
front
chapter
iii
an
unwelcome
guest
this
was
the
sort
of
work
i
had
long
ago
learned
to
love
it
warmed
the
blood
this
constant
certainty
of
imminent
peril
this
intense
probability
that
any
moment
might
bring
a
flash
of
flame
into
our
very
faces
each
step
we
took
was
now
a
stern
grim
play
with
fate
where
the
stakes
were
life
and
death
i
felt
my
pulses
throb
as
i
rode
steadily
forward
fairly
thrusting
the
darkness
aside
my
teeth
hard
set
my
left
hand
heavy
on
a
revolver
butt
how
in
such
a
situation
the
nerves
tingle
and
the
heart
bounds
to
each
strange
sight
and
sound
halt
what
was
that
pooh
no
more
than
the
deeper
shadow
of
a
sharply
projecting
rock
around
which
we
pick
careful
way
our
horses
crowding
against
each
other
in
the
narrow
space
and
that
nothing
but
the
faint
moan
of
the
night
wind
amid
the
dead
limbs
of
a
tree
ah
mark
that
sudden
flash
of
light
the
hand
that
closes
upon
the
loosened
rein
opens
again
for
it
was
merely
a
star
silently
falling
from
out
the
black
depths
of
the
sky
then
both
of
us
halt
at
once
and
peer
anxiously
forward
the
figure
standing
directly
in
the
centre
of
our
path
can
it
be
a
sentry
at
last
a
cautious
step
forward
a
low
laugh
from
the
sergeant
and
we
circle
the
gaunt
blackened
stump
as
silent
ourselves
as
the
night
about
us
but
with
fiercely
beating
expectant
hearts
but
hark
surely
that
was
no
common
sound
born
of
that
drear
loneliness
no
cavalryman
can
mistake
the
jingle
of
accoutrements
or
the
dull
thud
of
horses
hoofs
the
road
here
must
have
curved
sharply
for
they
were
already
so
close
upon
us
that
almost
simultaneously
with
the
sound
we
could
distinguish
the
deeper
shadow
of
a
small
compact
body
of
horsemen
directly
in
our
front
to
left
of
us
there
rose
sheer
and
black
the
precipitous
rock
to
right
we
might
not
even
guess
what
yawning
void
it
was
either
wit
or
now
i
know
not
how
it
may
be
with
others
in
such
emergencies
but
with
me
it
always
happens
that
the
sense
of
fear
departs
with
the
presence
of
actual
danger
before
the
gruesome
fancies
of
imagination
i
may
quake
and
burn
like
any
maiden
alone
upon
a
city
street
at
night
until
each
separate
nerve
becomes
a
very
demon
of
mental
agony
but
when
the
real
and
known
once
fairly
confronts
me
and
there
is
work
to
do
i
grow
instantly
cool
to
think
resolute
to
act
and
find
a
rare
joy
in
it
it
was
so
now
and
revolver
in
hand
but
hidden
beneath
my
holster
flap
i
leaned
over
and
touched
craig
arm
keep
quiet
i
whispered
sternly
let
them
challenge
first
and
no
firing
except
on
my
almost
with
the
words
there
came
the
sharp
hail
halt
who
comes
there
i
drew
the
cape
of
my
closer
so
as
better
to
muffle
the
sound
of
my
voice
friends
of
course
who
would
you
expect
to
meet
on
this
road
fortune
seemed
with
me
in
the
chance
answer
for
he
who
had
hailed
exclaimed
oh
is
that
you
brennan
there
was
no
time
now
for
hesitancy
here
was
my
cue
and
i
must
plunge
ahead
accepting
the
chances
i
ventured
it
no
brennan
could
come
i
am
here
in
his
indeed
who
are
you
major
there
was
a
moment
painful
pause
in
which
i
could
hear
my
heart
throb
wilkie
repeated
the
voice
doubtfully
there
is
no
officer
of
that
name
in
the
well
there
chances
to
be
such
an
officer
on
the
staff
i
retorted
permitting
a
trace
of
anger
to
appear
in
my
tone
and
i
am
the
what
the
devil
is
the
difference
hale
just
what
his
name
is
boomed
a
deeper
voice
back
in
the
group
we
are
not
getting
up
a
directory
of
the
sixth
corps
of
course
he
the
man
brennan
sent
and
that
is
all
we
got
to
look
oh
all
right
certainly
major
returned
the
first
speaker
hastily
but
the
night
is
so
cussed
black
i
supposed
we
must
be
at
least
a
mile
this
side
of
where
we
were
to
meet
however
we
have
the
lady
here
for
you
all
right
and
she
is
anxious
enough
to
get
the
lady
heavens
what
odd
turn
of
fortune
wheel
was
this
the
lady
i
heard
craig
smothered
chuckle
but
before
i
had
sufficiently
regained
control
over
my
own
feelings
to
venture
upon
a
suitable
reply
the
entire
party
had
drawn
forward
the
leader
pressing
so
close
to
my
side
that
i
felt
safer
with
my
face
well
shaded
where
is
your
escort
major
he
asked
and
the
gruffness
of
his
tone
put
me
instantly
on
defence
just
behind
us
i
returned
with
affected
carelessness
and
determined
now
to
play
out
the
game
lady
or
no
lady
i
was
extremely
sorry
for
her
but
the
cause
outweighed
her
comfort
the
sergeant
and
i
rode
out
ahead
when
we
heard
you
coming
where
is
the
lady
he
glanced
around
at
the
group
huddled
behind
him
third
on
the
all
right
then
nothing
else
i
believe
for
i
was
eager
to
get
away
sergeant
just
ride
in
there
and
lead
out
her
horse
we
will
have
to
be
moving
gentlemen
for
it
is
a
rough
road
and
a
dark
beastly
assented
the
other
heartily
i
fairly
held
my
breath
as
craig
rode
forward
if
one
of
them
should
chance
to
strike
a
match
to
light
a
pipe
or
any
false
movement
of
craig
should
excite
suspicion
if
he
should
even
speak
his
soft
southern
drawl
would
mean
instant
betrayal
and
how
coolly
he
went
at
it
with
a
sharp
touch
of
the
spur
causing
his
jaded
horse
to
exhibit
such
sudden
restlessness
as
to
keep
the
escort
well
to
one
side
while
he
ranged
close
up
to
our
unwelcome
guest
and
laying
firm
hand
upon
her
horse
bit
led
forth
to
where
i
waited
it
was
quickly
nobly
done
and
i
could
have
hugged
the
fellow
well
good
luck
to
you
major
and
a
pleasant
ride
remember
me
to
brennan
deuced
queer
though
why
he
failed
to
show
up
on
such
an
occasion
as
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
sent
out
in
the
other
direction
with
despatches
it
was
sweet
music
to
me
to
listen
to
their
dying
rapidly
away
behind
us
as
we
turned
back
down
the
dark
road
the
sergeant
still
riding
with
his
one
hand
grasping
the
stranger
rein
i
endeavored
to
scan
her
figure
in
the
blackness
but
found
the
effort
useless
as
little
more
than
a
shadow
was
visible
yet
it
was
impressed
upon
me
that
she
sat
straight
and
firm
in
the
saddle
so
i
concluded
she
must
be
young
rapidly
i
reviewed
our
predicament
and
sought
for
some
avenue
of
escape
if
we
were
only
certain
as
to
where
we
were
we
might
plan
with
better
prospect
of
success
the
woman
doubtless
she
would
know
and
possibly
i
might
venture
to
question
her
without
awakening
suspicion
surely
the
experiment
was
well
worth
trying
madam
i
began
seeking
to
feel
my
way
with
caution
into
her
confidence
i
fear
you
must
be
quite
wearied
by
your
long
she
turned
slightly
at
sound
of
my
voice
not
at
all
sir
i
am
merely
eager
to
push
on
besides
my
ride
has
not
been
a
long
one
as
we
merely
came
from
general
sigel
the
voice
was
pleasantly
modulated
and
refined
ah
yes
certainly
i
stammered
fearful
lest
i
had
made
a
grave
mistake
but
really
i
had
supposed
general
sigel
was
at
he
advanced
to
bear
creek
yesterday
she
returned
quietly
so
you
see
we
had
covered
scarcely
more
than
three
miles
when
we
met
how
much
farther
is
it
to
where
major
brennan
is
stationed
i
fear
i
was
guilty
of
hesitancy
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
i
am
unable
to
tell
exactly
for
as
it
chances
i
have
never
yet
been
in
the
camp
but
i
should
judge
that
two
hours
riding
will
cover
the
why
in
a
tone
of
sudden
surprise
captain
hale
certainly
told
me
it
was
all
of
twenty
miles
from
bear
creek
i
questioned
eagerly
for
it
was
my
turn
to
feel
startled
now
the
map
barely
makes
it
it
is
but
ten
and
scarcely
that
by
the
direct
white
briar
road
or
at
least
so
i
heard
some
of
the
younger
officers
say
but
it
seems
the
rebel
pickets
are
posted
so
close
to
the
white
briar
that
my
friends
decided
it
would
be
unsafe
to
proceed
that
this
was
news
indeed
news
so
unexpected
and
startling
that
i
forgot
all
caution
then
what
road
do
they
call
this
she
laughed
at
my
evident
ignorance
as
well
as
the
eagerness
of
my
tone
really
you
are
a
most
peculiar
guide
she
exclaimed
gayly
you
almost
convince
me
that
you
are
lost
fortunately
sir
out
of
my
vast
knowledge
of
this
mysterious
region
i
am
able
to
enlighten
you
to
some
extent
we
are
now
riding
due
southward
along
the
allentown
craig
leaned
forward
so
as
to
look
across
her
horse
neck
to
where
i
rode
on
the
opposite
side
may
i
speak
a
word
sir
he
asked
cautiously
certainly
sergeant
do
you
make
anything
out
of
all
this
yes
sir
he
answered
eagerly
i
know
now
exactly
how
we
missed
it
and
where
we
are
the
to
the
white
briar
i
spoke
to
you
about
this
afternoon
can
not
be
more
than
a
hundred
yards
below
ride
ahead
carefully
then
and
see
if
you
can
locate
it
be
cautious
there
may
be
a
picket
stationed
there
we
will
halt
where
we
are
until
you
he
swung
forward
his
carbine
where
it
would
be
handy
for
instant
service
and
trotted
ahead
into
the
darkness
the
woman
horse
being
comparatively
fresh
and
restless
danced
a
little
in
an
effort
to
follow
but
i
restrained
him
with
a
light
hand
on
the
bit
and
for
a
moment
we
sat
waiting
in
silence
then
her
natural
curiosity
prompted
a
question
why
is
it
you
seem
so
anxious
to
discover
this
cutoff
we
merely
desire
to
take
advantage
of
the
more
direct
road
i
replied
somewhat
shortly
besides
we
are
much
farther
to
the
east
than
i
had
supposed
and
therefore
too
close
to
the
lines
of
the
how
strange
it
is
you
should
not
have
known
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
indignant
wonder
but
as
i
made
no
reply
she
did
not
venture
to
speak
again
my
thoughts
at
that
moment
indeed
were
not
with
her
although
i
kept
firm
hold
upon
her
rein
i
was
eager
to
be
off
to
make
up
by
hard
riding
the
tedious
delay
of
this
night
work
and
constantly
listening
in
dread
for
some
sounds
of
struggle
down
the
roadway
but
all
remained
silent
until
i
could
dimly
distinguish
the
returning
of
the
sergeant
horse
and
so
anxious
was
i
to
economize
time
that
i
was
already
urging
our
mounts
forward
when
his
shadow
grew
black
in
front
and
he
wheeled
in
at
my
side
no
picket
there
very
well
sergeant
when
we
come
to
the
turn
you
are
to
ride
a
few
rods
in
advance
of
us
and
will
set
a
good
pace
for
now
we
must
make
up
for
all
this
lost
i
caught
the
motion
of
his
hand
as
it
was
lifted
in
salute
very
well
sir
here
is
the
turn
to
your
i
could
dimly
distinguish
the
opening
designated
and
as
we
wheeled
into
it
he
at
once
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
forged
ahead
in
another
moment
he
had
totally
disappeared
and
as
i
urged
our
reluctant
mounts
to
more
rapid
speed
all
sound
of
his
progress
was
instantly
lost
in
the
pounding
of
our
own
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
it
was
like
riding
directly
against
a
black
wall
and
far
from
comforting
to
the
nerves
for
the
path
was
a
strange
one
and
not
too
well
made
fortunately
the
horses
followed
the
curves
without
mishap
save
an
occasional
awkward
stumble
amid
loose
stones
while
the
high
walls
of
rock
on
either
hand
made
a
somewhat
denser
shadow
where
they
shut
off
the
lower
stars
and
thus
helped
me
to
guide
our
progress
but
it
was
no
time
for
conversation
even
had
the
inclination
been
mine
for
every
nerve
was
now
strained
to
intensity
as
i
spurred
on
my
horse
and
held
tightly
to
the
bridle
of
the
other
almost
cursing
as
i
rode
the
unlucky
chance
which
brought
us
such
a
burden
on
a
night
like
this
chapter
iv
a
woman
with
a
temper
i
thought
the
stars
grew
somewhat
brighter
as
we
galloped
on
the
hoofs
now
and
then
striking
out
sudden
sparks
of
yellow
flame
from
the
flinty
surface
of
the
road
but
this
may
have
resulted
from
the
lowering
of
the
rocky
barriers
on
either
side
making
the
arch
of
sky
more
clearly
visible
the
air
perceptibly
freshened
with
a
chilly
mountain
wind
beating
against
our
faces
and
rustling
the
leaves
of
the
phantom
trees
that
lined
the
way
the
woman
rode
silently
and
well
i
could
make
out
her
figure
now
dim
and
indistinct
as
the
outlines
were
in
that
darkness
and
wrapped
in
the
loose
folds
of
an
officer
cloak
she
was
sitting
firm
and
upright
in
the
saddle
i
even
marked
how
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
practical
horsewoman
she
held
the
reins
i
think
we
must
have
been
fully
an
hour
at
it
riding
at
no
mean
pace
and
with
utter
disregard
of
danger
although
i
knew
little
of
where
we
were
and
nothing
as
to
the
condition
of
the
path
we
traversed
yet
so
complete
was
my
confidence
in
craig
that
i
felt
no
hesitancy
in
blindly
following
the
pace
he
set
then
a
black
shape
loomed
up
before
us
so
suddenly
that
it
was
only
by
a
quick
effort
i
prevented
a
collision
even
as
i
held
my
horse
poised
half
in
air
i
perceived
it
was
craig
who
blocked
the
way
what
is
it
sergeant
a
picket
sir
at
the
end
of
the
road
he
said
quietly
i
kinder
reckoned
they
hev
some
sort
o
guard
thar
so
i
crept
up
on
the
quiet
ter
be
sure
the
feller
helped
me
out
a
bit
by
a
match
ter
see
what
time
was
or
i
reckon
i
a
walked
over
him
in
ther
had
we
better
ride
him
down
i
asked
thinking
only
how
rapidly
the
night
hours
were
speeding
and
of
the
importance
of
the
duty
pressing
upon
us
not
with
ther
woman
sir
he
answered
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
besides
we
never
could
git
through
without
a
shot
an
if
by
any
dern
luck
it
should
turn
out
ter
be
a
cavalry
outpost
an
i
sorter
reckon
that
what
it
is
why
our
horses
are
in
no
shape
fer
a
hard
run
you
uns
better
wait
here
sir
an
let
me
tend
ter
that
soger
man
quiet
like
an
then
we
uns
kin
all
slip
by
without
a
stirrin
up
ther
well
i
said
reluctantly
yielding
to
what
i
felt
was
doubtless
the
wiser
course
and
mechanically
grasping
the
rein
he
held
out
to
me
go
ahead
but
be
careful
and
do
waste
any
time
if
we
hear
the
sound
of
a
shot
we
shall
ride
forward
under
all
right
sir
but
there
be
no
fuss
fer
i
know
just
whar
ther
fellar
time
seems
criminally
long
when
one
is
compelled
to
wait
in
helpless
uncertainty
every
nerve
on
strain
hold
yourself
ready
for
a
sudden
start
i
said
warningly
to
my
companion
if
there
is
any
noise
of
a
struggle
yonder
i
shall
drive
in
the
as
i
spoke
i
swung
the
sergeant
horse
around
to
my
side
where
i
could
control
him
more
readily
there
was
no
reply
from
the
woman
but
i
noticed
she
endeavored
to
draw
together
the
flapping
cape
of
her
cloak
as
though
she
felt
chilled
by
the
wind
and
her
figure
seemed
to
stiffen
in
the
saddle
are
you
cold
i
questioned
more
perhaps
to
throttle
my
own
nervousness
by
speech
than
from
better
motive
she
shook
her
head
then
as
if
thinking
better
of
it
answered
lightly
the
wind
appears
to
find
no
obstacle
in
this
cloak
but
i
am
not
i
wrapped
the
loose
rein
of
craig
horse
about
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
and
bent
toward
her
permit
me
i
said
you
probably
do
not
comprehend
the
intricacies
of
a
cavalry
cloak
if
i
fasten
these
upper
frogs
i
think
it
will
help
to
keep
out
the
night
without
protest
she
permitted
me
to
draw
the
flapping
cloth
together
and
fasten
it
closer
about
her
throat
but
whatever
tantalizing
curiosity
i
may
have
felt
to
view
her
face
was
effectually
blocked
by
the
high
collar
behind
which
she
immediately
took
refuge
i
am
sure
that
will
be
much
better
you
are
very
the
words
were
pleasant
enough
yet
there
was
something
in
both
tone
and
manner
that
piqued
me
and
i
turned
away
without
speaking
it
came
at
last
not
the
sharp
flash
of
a
musket
cleaving
the
night
in
twain
but
merely
the
tall
figure
of
the
sergeant
stealing
silently
out
of
the
gloom
like
a
black
ghost
and
standing
at
our
very
heads
all
clear
sir
he
reported
in
a
tone
but
we
shall
hev
ter
move
mighty
quiet
fer
ther
main
picket
post
ai
more
nor
a
hundred
yards
ter
the
right
o
ther
he
did
not
remount
but
with
reins
flung
loosely
over
his
arm
led
the
way
slowly
forward
and
carefully
we
followed
him
what
had
become
of
the
sentinel
i
did
not
know
respecting
evident
desire
for
silence
but
as
we
drew
nearer
the
white
briar
road
i
sought
in
vain
to
pierce
the
dense
gloom
and
note
some
sign
of
a
struggle
some
darker
shadow
where
a
body
might
be
lying
there
was
nothing
visible
to
tell
the
story
the
sergeant
walked
without
the
least
hesitation
across
the
open
space
directly
into
the
deep
shadows
opposite
where
the
continued
to
hold
way
crouching
low
in
the
saddle
we
followed
him
as
silently
as
though
we
were
but
spirits
of
the
night
up
the
road
i
caught
the
red
gleam
of
a
fire
almost
spent
and
a
black
figure
crossed
between
us
casting
an
odd
shadow
against
the
face
of
the
rock
where
it
was
lighted
by
the
flickering
red
blaze
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
a
mere
glimpse
but
it
formed
one
of
those
sudden
pictures
which
paint
themselves
on
the
brain
and
can
never
after
be
effaced
i
recall
yet
the
long
shade
cast
by
the
man
gun
the
grotesque
shape
of
his
flapping
army
overcoat
the
quick
change
in
the
silhouette
as
he
wheeled
to
retrace
his
beat
but
there
was
no
noise
not
even
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
reaching
us
even
as
i
gazed
lying
nearly
full
length
upon
my
horse
we
had
crossed
the
open
and
a
perfect
tangle
of
low
bushes
hid
us
as
completely
as
if
we
had
entered
the
yawning
mouth
of
a
cavern
a
hundred
yards
or
more
of
sharply
curving
road
densely
lined
with
shrubbery
on
either
hand
and
then
craig
swung
into
saddle
and
again
gave
spur
to
his
horse
we
must
ride
for
it
now
he
said
tersely
when
thet
patrol
makes
their
round
them
fellers
will
be
after
us
i
urged
my
tired
horse
to
a
gallop
pressing
upon
craig
heels
as
closely
as
i
dared
nor
did
i
glance
back
for
i
knew
well
that
a
dead
picket
was
lying
somewhere
by
the
and
that
his
comrades
would
be
heard
from
before
the
dawn
we
were
moving
bravely
now
for
the
road
under
foot
grew
better
as
we
advanced
and
gave
back
the
dull
thud
of
soft
earth
instead
of
the
rattling
clang
of
the
rocks
we
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
i
forced
the
scabbard
of
my
sabre
beneath
the
bend
of
my
knee
to
keep
it
from
clanging
against
the
iron
stirrup
and
only
the
breathing
of
the
horses
and
their
heavy
pounding
on
the
earth
broke
the
night
silence
craig
was
riding
directly
in
my
front
sitting
erect
as
if
on
parade
and
the
woman
horse
kept
up
the
pace
without
apparent
effort
surely
we
had
already
covered
a
good
safe
mile
from
where
we
had
left
the
dead
soldier
to
tell
his
speechless
story
and
the
way
ahead
was
clear
my
spirits
rose
buoyantly
with
every
stride
of
the
horse
and
my
faith
never
long
dormant
already
saw
my
task
accomplished
my
pledge
to
lee
fulfilled
but
it
is
the
unexpected
which
masters
us
in
the
end
i
had
all
but
completely
shut
the
dark
night
from
my
thoughts
i
suppose
in
truth
i
was
as
keenly
observant
as
ever
but
it
now
seems
to
me
that
i
was
riding
that
black
road
with
closed
eyes
so
busy
were
my
thoughts
elsewhere
then
suddenly
my
horse
was
jerked
almost
to
a
standstill
the
hand
upon
his
bit
seemingly
as
hard
as
my
own
and
i
wheeled
in
the
saddle
pressing
my
knees
tightly
to
prevent
being
thrown
only
to
perceive
the
woman
tugging
desperately
at
the
lines
what
now
i
asked
sharply
and
in
sudden
anger
i
forced
her
to
release
her
grasp
we
must
ride
and
ride
hard
madam
to
be
out
of
this
cordon
by
ride
where
she
faced
me
stiffly
and
there
was
a
slight
sting
in
her
voice
i
felt
where
i
repeated
then
partially
gathering
my
scattered
wits
why
to
the
camp
we
are
seeking
of
i
was
conscious
that
her
eyes
were
striving
anxiously
to
see
my
face
in
the
darkness
that
her
suspicions
were
now
fully
aroused
yet
her
quick
retort
surprised
me
you
lie
she
said
coldly
that
was
a
federal
picket
he
it
was
no
time
for
argument
and
i
knew
it
any
moment
might
bring
to
us
the
sound
of
in
pursuit
more
i
realized
that
anything
i
might
hope
to
say
would
only
tend
to
make
matters
worse
there
was
but
one
course
open
she
must
be
compelled
to
ride
by
force
if
necessary
why
should
i
hesitate
she
had
no
claim
on
my
consideration
and
i
hardened
my
heart
to
make
her
comprehend
once
and
for
all
that
i
was
the
master
even
as
i
reached
this
decision
craig
noting
our
pause
had
ridden
back
and
reined
in
beside
us
without
a
word
you
are
right
i
said
tersely
in
one
sense
of
the
word
you
are
prisoner
for
the
time
being
at
least
but
not
through
any
wish
of
mine
we
do
not
make
war
on
women
and
your
being
in
this
situation
is
altogether
an
accident
however
be
that
as
it
may
we
must
first
of
all
protect
ourselves
i
would
very
gladly
leave
you
with
your
friends
if
possible
but
as
things
have
shaped
themselves
there
remains
but
one
alternative
must
ride
as
i
i
could
mark
her
quick
breathing
while
i
spoke
and
when
i
concluded
one
hand
went
up
to
her
throat
as
if
she
choked
you
you
are
not
major
brennan
friend
then
you
were
not
sent
by
frank
to
meet
me
the
questions
burst
from
her
lips
so
rapidly
that
i
scarcely
caught
their
import
i
am
captain
philip
wayne
th
virginia
cavalry
at
your
service
madam
i
said
calmly
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
major
brennan
she
seemed
not
to
know
what
to
say
and
sat
there
staring
at
me
through
the
darkness
as
she
might
have
gazed
in
speechless
horror
at
some
wild
animal
she
expected
would
spring
upon
her
a
rebel
the
hated
word
hissed
from
her
lips
as
if
the
utterance
burned
them
yes
madam
i
said
somewhat
coldly
for
i
was
not
especially
fond
of
the
term
that
is
what
they
call
us
on
your
side
but
also
an
officer
and
a
i
doubt
if
she
even
heard
me
all
i
know
is
she
suddenly
lifted
the
heavy
riding
whip
that
was
clinched
in
her
right
hand
struck
me
with
it
full
across
the
face
and
then
as
i
quickly
flung
up
my
own
arm
to
ward
off
a
second
blow
she
sent
the
lash
swirling
down
upon
the
flank
of
her
horse
with
one
bound
the
maddened
animal
wrenched
the
reins
from
out
my
hands
nearly
dragging
me
from
the
saddle
and
swerved
sharply
to
the
left
there
was
a
shock
a
smothered
oath
a
moment
fierce
struggle
in
the
darkness
the
sharp
ping
of
the
whip
as
it
came
down
once
twice
then
silence
broken
only
by
deep
breathing
i
got
her
captain
chuckled
the
sergeant
softly
but
if
i
know
what
to
do
with
there
was
small
sentiment
of
mercy
in
my
heart
as
i
drew
up
toward
them
for
my
cheek
burned
where
the
lash
had
struck
as
though
scorched
with
fire
for
the
moment
i
felt
utterly
indifferent
to
all
claims
of
her
womanhood
she
had
unsexed
herself
and
deserved
treatment
accordingly
it
was
thus
i
felt
as
i
clinched
my
teeth
in
pain
but
when
i
saw
her
leaning
helplessly
forward
on
her
horse
neck
all
bravado
gone
her
hands
pinioned
behind
her
in
the
iron
grip
of
the
sergeant
my
fierce
resentment
died
away
within
me
let
go
her
hands
i
commanded
briefly
she
lifted
her
body
slightly
from
its
cramped
uncomfortable
posture
but
her
head
remained
bowed
madam
i
spoke
sternly
for
moments
were
of
value
now
listen
to
what
i
say
we
are
confederate
soldiers
passing
through
the
federal
lines
with
despatches
in
order
to
save
ourselves
from
discovery
and
capture
we
were
compelled
to
take
you
in
charge
it
was
the
fortune
of
war
if
now
we
could
honorably
leave
you
here
we
would
most
gladly
do
so
for
having
you
with
us
adds
vastly
to
our
own
danger
but
these
mountains
are
simply
overrun
with
wandering
guerillas
who
would
show
you
neither
respect
nor
mercy
we
simply
dare
not
as
honorable
men
leave
you
here
unprotected
and
consequently
you
must
continue
to
ride
in
our
company
now
answer
me
plainly
will
you
proceed
quietly
or
shall
we
be
compelled
to
tie
you
to
your
horse
i
knew
she
was
crying
but
with
an
effort
she
succeeded
in
steadying
her
voice
sufficiently
to
reply
i
will
go
she
said
thank
you
and
i
gravely
lifted
my
hat
as
i
spoke
you
have
saved
me
a
most
unpleasant
duty
you
may
ride
on
sergeant
this
lady
and
i
will
follow
as
she
scarcely
changed
her
posture
as
i
spurred
forward
riding
now
so
close
to
her
side
that
i
could
feel
the
flap
of
her
saddle
rise
and
fall
against
my
knee
whatever
of
evil
she
may
have
thought
of
us
i
felt
that
she
was
sorry
enough
now
for
her
hasty
action
and
i
forgave
the
pain
that
yet
stung
me
and
longed
without
well
knowing
how
to
tell
her
so
chapter
v
a
disaster
on
the
road
to
me
she
was
merely
a
woman
whom
it
had
become
my
duty
to
protect
and
whatever
of
chivalrous
feeling
i
may
have
held
toward
her
was
based
upon
nothing
deeper
than
this
knowledge
she
had
come
to
us
undesired
and
in
darkness
her
form
enveloped
in
a
cavalry
cloak
her
face
shrouded
by
the
night
as
to
whether
she
was
young
or
old
i
had
scarce
means
of
knowing
saving
only
that
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
the
graceful
manner
of
her
riding
made
me
confident
that
she
had
not
lost
the
agility
of
youth
but
beyond
this
vague
impression
it
was
little
more
and
a
fleeting
gleam
of
the
starlight
in
her
eyes
as
she
faced
me
in
anger
i
was
as
totally
unaware
of
how
she
really
looked
as
though
we
had
never
met
her
very
name
was
unknown
to
me
who
was
this
major
brennan
was
he
father
brother
or
husband
and
was
her
name
brennan
also
for
some
reason
this
last
possibility
was
repugnant
to
me
yet
i
knew
not
why
i
turned
these
thoughts
over
in
my
mind
speculating
idly
upon
them
not
because
i
felt
any
interest
in
their
solution
or
in
the
woman
riding
at
my
side
but
because
they
seemed
to
fall
into
order
to
the
steady
music
of
my
horse
feet
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
no
i
said
to
myself
there
is
certainly
no
leaving
her
except
in
a
disciplined
camp
young
or
old
yankee
or
what
not
she
is
in
our
care
and
we
keep
her
out
of
the
hands
of
those
between
the
i
glanced
toward
her
wondering
what
the
morning
light
might
reveal
as
to
her
appearance
she
was
sitting
erect
and
easy
in
the
saddle
yet
seemed
to
ride
with
her
face
averted
from
me
you
ride
as
though
born
to
the
saddle
i
said
pleasantly
and
although
i
spoke
low
we
were
so
close
together
that
my
voice
carried
distinctly
to
her
ears
we
have
been
sufficiently
conceited
to
suppose
that
to
be
an
accomplishment
peculiar
to
our
southern
i
have
been
accustomed
to
ride
since
childhood
she
replied
rather
shortly
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
restraint
in
her
manner
far
from
pleasing
yet
i
ventured
upon
one
more
effort
at
conversation
is
major
brennan
an
officer
on
sheridan
staff
i
was
not
aware
and
i
could
not
mistake
the
accent
of
vindictiveness
in
her
voice
that
prisoners
were
obliged
to
converse
against
their
my
lady
certainly
possessed
a
temper
of
her
own
and
i
was
obliged
to
smile
there
in
the
dark
at
her
high
head
and
quick
retort
i
ask
your
pardon
i
am
sure
i
returned
soberly
but
my
question
was
not
altogether
an
idle
one
i
have
chanced
to
meet
several
of
general
sheridan
staff
and
thought
possibly
major
brennan
might
have
been
of
their
number
seeing
that
we
must
associate
for
a
time
i
naturally
felt
it
would
prove
pleasanter
for
both
of
us
if
we
might
discover
some
mutual
there
was
no
response
her
eyes
were
fastened
upon
the
road
ahead
and
evidently
my
lady
possessed
no
desire
for
the
discovery
of
any
such
tie
watching
her
i
pressed
my
lips
together
and
held
her
as
a
proud
and
silly
fool
i
would
perform
my
full
duty
toward
her
of
course
but
beyond
that
i
would
go
no
further
the
pace
we
were
travelling
had
already
told
severely
on
the
horses
although
hers
was
by
far
the
best
and
freshest
of
the
three
my
own
brave
sorrel
had
stumbled
several
times
already
in
a
way
that
gave
me
no
small
uneasiness
yet
i
durst
not
venture
to
draw
rein
or
even
slacken
speed
already
beyond
a
doubt
the
patrol
in
our
rear
had
missed
the
picket
stationed
at
the
crossroads
had
searched
until
they
found
the
lifeless
body
where
craig
had
hidden
it
and
were
now
hot
upon
our
trail
hard
continuous
riding
alone
could
save
us
riding
with
a
thoroughly
aroused
enemy
at
our
heels
and
yet
another
picket
line
to
pass
before
we
could
even
hope
for
a
clear
sweep
into
safety
the
road
we
were
following
here
took
a
sudden
trend
downward
and
we
could
tell
from
the
sharper
ring
of
the
hoofs
and
the
spitting
of
flinty
sparks
beneath
us
that
we
were
among
rocks
once
more
then
our
horses
suddenly
splashed
into
water
and
i
held
them
up
long
enough
to
drink
i
felt
thirst
strongly
myself
and
slipping
out
of
the
saddle
filled
my
canteen
would
you
care
for
a
drink
i
asked
stemming
the
stream
to
reach
her
side
and
holding
the
vessel
within
easy
grasp
of
her
hand
i
actually
believe
her
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
haughtily
this
proffered
civility
from
an
enemy
of
her
country
but
the
deep
sense
of
need
conquered
foolish
pride
and
caused
her
to
accept
the
offering
i
am
very
thankful
to
you
she
said
handing
back
the
canteen
yet
the
words
were
spoken
in
mockery
i
ignored
them
and
swung
into
my
saddle
without
response
another
hill
followed
and
then
another
and
finally
we
swept
swiftly
down
a
long
slope
densely
bordered
by
trees
and
with
irregular
piles
of
rock
uprearing
ugly
heads
on
either
hand
a
little
edge
of
the
waning
moon
began
to
peep
over
the
ridge
of
the
hill
and
yielded
sufficient
light
to
enable
our
eyes
to
discern
dimly
the
faint
track
we
followed
i
remember
remarking
the
blacker
figure
of
the
sergeant
ahead
of
us
and
already
halfway
down
the
long
decline
i
caught
a
swift
glimpse
of
a
rough
log
house
on
the
right
so
set
back
among
trees
that
i
half
doubted
its
real
existence
when
there
was
a
slip
the
crunching
of
a
stone
a
long
stumble
forward
that
fairly
wrenched
my
hand
loose
from
the
woman
rein
and
then
hopelessly
struggling
to
regain
his
feet
my
horse
went
down
with
a
crash
head
under
and
i
was
hurled
heavily
forward
upon
my
face
severely
bruised
by
the
shock
but
fortunately
without
broken
bones
i
recall
even
as
i
fell
wondering
if
my
prisoner
would
grasp
this
opportunity
for
escape
quite
probably
the
thought
never
occurred
to
her
perhaps
her
woman
heart
in
the
stress
of
such
accident
held
her
motionless
but
craig
startled
at
the
sudden
crash
behind
him
spurred
back
to
learn
the
full
extent
of
my
disaster
by
this
time
i
had
regained
my
feet
i
all
right
i
think
sergeant
i
said
hastily
but
the
sorrel
has
broken
her
he
began
to
swear
at
our
ill
luck
but
i
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
he
knew
better
than
to
ignore
enough
of
that
i
commanded
sternly
bad
fortune
is
seldom
bettered
by
hard
words
first
of
all
help
me
to
drag
this
dead
body
out
of
on
one
side
of
us
the
bank
fell
away
with
such
precipitancy
that
when
we
once
succeeded
in
dragging
our
load
to
the
edge
we
experienced
no
difficulty
in
sending
it
crashing
downward
the
body
plunged
through
the
thick
underbrush
at
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
where
i
knew
it
would
be
completely
hidden
even
in
the
glare
of
daylight
from
the
prying
eyes
of
any
troopers
riding
hard
upon
our
track
with
a
branch
hastily
wrenched
from
a
tree
i
carefully
raked
over
the
track
so
that
as
far
as
i
could
determine
in
the
dim
light
all
outward
trace
of
my
accident
had
been
fairly
obliterated
as
we
rapidly
worked
on
this
disagreeable
task
i
thought
and
planned
two
horses
and
three
riders
one
of
these
latter
a
woman
in
need
of
protection
a
despatch
to
be
delivered
by
daylight
at
all
hazards
it
was
indeed
a
difficult
proposition
and
i
saw
only
a
single
possible
solution
one
of
our
number
must
press
on
two
of
us
must
remain
behind
which
one
what
two
if
i
rode
with
the
despatch
and
how
eagerly
i
longed
to
do
so
and
succeeded
in
bringing
lee
message
safe
to
longstreet
it
meant
much
to
me
promotion
distinction
honor
on
the
other
hand
if
i
remained
behind
and
craig
successfully
carried
out
the
duty
which
had
been
especially
intrusted
to
me
i
should
be
fortunate
indeed
to
escape
with
a
reprimand
instead
of
more
serious
consequences
if
failure
resulted
it
meant
certain
and
deserved
disgrace
yet
i
could
absolutely
trust
him
with
the
despatch
he
was
a
soldier
and
would
faithfully
perform
a
soldier
duty
more
he
would
carry
the
message
with
even
greater
certainty
than
i
for
he
knew
the
roads
much
better
and
i
write
the
words
hesitatingly
i
could
not
trust
him
there
alone
with
the
woman
i
glanced
aside
at
him
as
i
thus
turned
the
perplexing
situation
over
in
my
mind
a
tall
gaunt
mountaineer
whose
sole
discipline
of
mind
and
body
had
been
the
army
hardened
by
service
until
every
muscle
in
his
lean
sinewy
frame
was
like
steel
a
cavalryman
who
would
follow
his
leader
into
the
very
jaws
of
hell
but
whose
morals
were
those
of
the
camp
and
whose
face
revealed
audacious
deviltry
such
as
no
man
would
care
to
see
in
one
to
whom
he
intrusted
the
welfare
of
sister
or
wife
recalling
to
mind
certain
idle
stories
that
circulated
through
the
camp
from
time
to
time
in
which
his
name
had
figured
i
glanced
backward
to
where
the
woman
sat
her
horse
in
silence
and
loneliness
and
made
my
resolve
i
would
risk
the
censure
if
there
must
be
sacrifice
it
should
be
mine
sergeant
i
asked
flinging
aside
the
improvised
brush
how
far
do
you
suppose
we
are
from
longstreet
picket
line
ten
miles
at
the
very
best
sir
he
answered
promptly
an
i
reckon
with
another
yankee
outpost
with
fair
luck
and
good
riding
it
might
be
made
by
daylight
i
reckon
as
how
it
might
captain
if
we
only
hed
sum
fresh
hosses
he
said
glumly
but
it
bin
mighty
hard
on
my
nag
i
looked
fer
him
to
roll
over
like
yer
sorrel
did
fer
the
las
two
well
craig
you
shall
have
both
horses
ride
the
woman
it
is
the
fresher
of
the
two
but
you
are
to
get
through
if
you
kill
them
both
and
then
his
face
brightened
and
he
raised
his
hand
in
salute
and
you
he
asked
wonderingly
i
remain
with
the
woman
there
is
no
other
way
wait
here
a
moment
while
i
speak
with
i
left
him
standing
there
and
moved
back
to
where
she
waited
as
i
came
up
she
faced
me
and
for
the
first
time
for
the
night
had
lightened
somewhat
i
could
see
her
eyes
and
discern
some
faint
outline
of
her
face
where
the
night
wind
flung
back
the
upturned
cape
it
was
a
winsome
sight
to
soldier
vision
but
with
a
certain
semblance
of
pride
and
reserve
about
it
that
caused
a
hesitancy
in
my
speech
strange
enough
to
me
i
felt
oddly
like
a
bashful
boy
and
involuntarily
lifted
my
hat
as
i
approached
to
cover
my
confusion
some
trick
of
the
dancing
moon
shadows
made
me
imagine
that
she
smiled
and
the
sight
nerved
me
instantly
to
speak
bluntly
the
words
i
came
to
say
madam
i
rested
my
hand
upon
her
horse
mane
and
looked
up
at
her
with
a
glance
as
proud
as
her
own
it
might
be
as
well
for
you
to
draw
the
cape
closer
about
your
face
at
present
there
are
rough
men
in
all
armies
who
would
consider
your
beauty
a
lawful
prize
the
life
we
lead
is
not
conducive
to
gentleness
virtue
is
not
born
in
camps
and
it
would
be
better
not
to
provoke
a
danger
which
may
be
so
easily
a
wave
of
sudden
color
swept
her
cheeks
at
my
plain
speech
and
her
hand
sought
the
collar
of
the
cloak
yet
paused
there
irresolute
you
claimed
i
believe
to
be
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
she
said
coldly
i
smiled
even
as
i
felt
the
full
chill
of
her
words
and
my
purpose
stiffened
within
me
even
as
i
yet
claim
and
trust
to
be
able
to
prove
to
your
satisfaction
my
eyes
looked
unfalteringly
into
hers
but
unfortunately
i
have
one
with
me
who
is
neither
i
would
that
he
were
for
my
own
sake
however
madam
let
that
pass
the
fact
is
here
and
we
have
no
time
to
argue
or
quarrel
i
have
already
told
you
that
we
ride
with
despatches
for
longstreet
these
must
go
forward
at
all
hazards
for
thousands
of
human
lives
depend
upon
them
yet
i
dare
not
leave
you
here
alone
and
unprotected
to
the
mercies
of
the
wolves
who
haunt
these
you
are
exceedingly
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
was
most
sarcastic
i
thank
you
for
your
approbation
and
i
bowed
again
but
i
venture
to
tell
you
this
merely
because
i
have
already
fully
determined
to
despatch
the
sergeant
forward
with
the
message
and
remain
behind
myself
to
render
you
every
protection
do
you
mean
that
we
are
to
remain
here
alone
there
is
no
other
she
made
no
reply
but
her
proud
unbelieving
eyes
were
no
longer
upon
my
face
i
beg
you
to
believe
madam
i
pleaded
gently
for
i
confess
my
interest
in
her
good
opinion
was
growing
stronger
that
i
do
this
only
because
i
believe
it
to
be
a
duty
and
not
that
i
desire
in
any
way
to
distress
you
with
my
she
swept
my
upturned
face
suddenly
with
questioning
eyes
as
your
prisoner
i
presume
i
have
no
choice
in
the
i
should
prefer
that
you
took
a
different
view
but
in
a
measure
you
are
very
well
sir
i
simply
yield
to
what
i
am
powerless
to
avoid
and
will
obey
your
orders
however
distasteful
they
may
be
what
is
your
first
command
that
you
dismount
the
sergeant
must
ride
your
horse
as
he
is
the
more
fit
of
the
greatly
to
my
surprise
and
relief
she
placed
her
gauntleted
hand
in
mine
and
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
protest
permitted
me
to
swing
her
lightly
from
the
saddle
to
the
ground
craig
i
called
come
here
and
turning
to
her
added
quietly
kindly
draw
up
your
cape
for
a
i
noticed
her
hands
fasten
the
clasps
which
had
become
loosened
and
that
she
turned
partially
so
as
to
look
backward
up
the
road
as
the
sergeant
drew
near
you
know
your
work
i
said
to
him
briefly
and
now
the
sooner
you
are
at
it
the
better
ride
this
horse
and
lead
your
own
as
soon
as
you
deliver
lee
message
at
headquarters
hunt
up
the
cavalry
brigade
commander
and
report
to
him
my
position
get
a
detail
insist
upon
one
and
be
back
here
by
without
fail
that
is
he
saluted
wheeled
about
swung
lightly
into
saddle
and
rode
off
on
a
rapid
trot
grasping
as
he
passed
down
the
hill
the
rein
of
his
own
mount
and
leading
it
lagging
behind
him
until
the
night
swallowed
the
figures
and
even
the
sound
of
the
could
be
no
longer
heard
we
were
alone
chapter
vi
a
struggle
in
the
dark
i
have
seldom
been
more
deeply
embarrassed
than
at
that
moment
i
knew
not
what
to
say
or
how
best
to
approach
this
young
woman
left
so
strangely
to
my
protection
the
very
fact
which
i
now
realized
that
she
was
both
young
and
fair
added
some
indefinite
burden
and
complicated
the
delicate
situation
i
saw
no
safety
for
us
but
in
careful
hiding
until
craig
could
return
a
squad
of
troopers
at
his
back
to
permit
the
girl
to
venture
forward
alone
through
the
desolate
country
we
were
in
overrun
as
i
knew
it
to
be
by
irregular
bands
whose
sole
purpose
was
plunder
and
whose
treatment
of
women
had
made
my
blood
run
cold
as
i
listened
to
its
recital
was
not
to
be
so
much
as
thought
of
even
if
by
rare
good
fortune
she
should
succeed
in
safely
reaching
the
federal
picket
post
in
our
front
the
men
on
duty
there
were
just
as
likely
as
not
to
prove
of
the
same
desperate
stamp
and
every
indignity
might
be
offered
her
were
she
to
appear
alone
nor
could
i
venture
to
accompany
her
on
such
a
trip
for
to
do
so
would
but
assure
my
own
capture
and
involve
months
of
confinement
in
northern
prisons
even
were
i
fortunate
enough
to
escape
with
life
wearing
as
i
did
the
full
field
uniform
of
my
rank
it
was
hardly
probable
that
regular
troops
would
treat
me
as
a
spy
even
though
caught
within
their
lines
but
if
we
fell
into
the
hands
of
guerillas
it
would
be
a
short
shrift
indeed
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
but
one
way
out
disagreeable
as
that
might
prove
to
my
lady
she
stood
there
before
me
motionless
and
silent
as
a
statue
exactly
where
she
had
alighted
when
the
sergeant
took
her
horse
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
plainly
read
righteous
indignation
in
the
indistinct
outline
of
her
figure
and
the
haughty
pose
of
her
head
to
her
at
that
moment
i
was
evidently
a
most
disagreeable
and
even
hated
companion
a
rebel
the
being
of
all
others
she
had
been
taught
to
despise
the
enemy
of
all
she
held
sacred
could
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
well
unpleasant
as
was
the
task
it
had
to
be
done
so
mustering
my
courage
for
the
ordeal
as
i
never
had
to
do
in
time
of
battle
i
advanced
toward
her
hat
in
hand
she
never
so
much
as
glanced
about
at
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
nor
deigned
by
the
slightest
motion
to
acknowledge
my
presence
so
intense
indeed
was
her
evident
sense
of
indignity
that
it
awoke
within
me
something
akin
to
anger
at
her
unreasonableness
and
for
the
moment
i
clinched
my
teeth
to
keep
back
the
hot
words
burning
upon
my
tongue
then
i
smiled
grimly
with
the
rare
humor
of
it
and
became
myself
once
more
the
time
has
come
when
it
becomes
my
duty
to
look
after
your
comfort
and
safety
i
said
striving
to
disguise
all
every
moment
we
delay
now
merely
increases
the
danger
of
our
remaining
i
imagine
i
might
very
easily
dispense
with
any
further
care
on
your
her
reply
nettled
me
and
i
answered
with
an
earnestness
which
she
could
neither
ignore
nor
check
possibly
you
may
think
so
but
if
you
do
it
is
merely
because
of
your
utter
ignorance
of
the
disorganized
conditions
which
prevail
in
these
mountains
your
pride
is
almost
ridiculous
under
all
the
circumstances
you
have
no
just
cause
to
feel
that
i
am
forcing
myself
unnecessarily
upon
you
our
being
compelled
to
take
you
in
charge
has
proven
as
disastrous
to
us
as
to
you
personally
i
can
say
that
nothing
will
relieve
me
more
than
to
be
able
to
place
you
uninjured
into
the
care
of
your
own
people
i
would
willingly
assume
great
risks
to
that
end
but
while
you
remain
here
and
in
my
care
i
shall
perform
my
full
duty
toward
you
as
though
you
were
my
own
sister
now
please
listen
to
me
and
i
assure
you
i
shall
speak
nothing
for
the
mere
purpose
of
alarming
you
but
simply
that
you
may
better
comprehend
the
facts
which
must
influence
our
present
relationship
i
have
sent
forward
sergeant
craig
with
the
message
especially
intrusted
to
me
for
delivery
and
thus
if
it
fail
to
reach
its
destination
i
have
laid
myself
open
to
the
charge
of
a
grave
military
crime
in
doing
this
i
have
not
only
perilled
my
own
future
but
the
lives
of
my
comrades
and
the
faith
of
my
commander
yet
i
have
deliberately
chosen
to
do
so
because
i
feel
the
impossibility
of
leaving
you
here
unprotected
and
because
i
was
unwilling
to
trust
you
alone
with
my
companion
i
made
this
choice
remember
without
in
the
least
knowing
whether
you
were
young
or
old
worthy
of
respect
or
unworthy
i
did
it
because
you
were
a
woman
alone
and
without
friends
whether
you
spurn
my
protection
or
not
will
make
no
difference
i
shall
simply
continue
to
do
what
i
may
on
your
behalf
until
you
are
again
in
the
hands
of
those
you
but
why
may
i
not
go
to
them
now
the
question
was
impetuous
but
the
voice
sounded
more
gentle
my
words
had
at
least
pierced
her
armor
simply
because
i
dare
not
permit
you
to
traverse
these
roads
alone
i
said
soberly
the
mountains
all
about
us
deserted
as
they
now
appear
are
filled
with
wandering
bands
of
desperate
and
hunted
men
whose
tenderest
mercy
is
death
any
rock
may
be
the
of
an
outlaw
any
dark
ravine
the
rendezvous
of
as
wild
a
gang
as
ever
murdered
for
plunder
for
months
past
yes
for
years
the
two
great
armies
have
scouted
these
hills
have
battled
for
them
and
every
forward
or
backward
movement
of
the
contesting
lines
has
left
its
worthless
horde
of
stragglers
behind
until
with
guerilla
and
bushwhacker
fleeing
conscript
and
deserter
it
has
become
such
a
of
rascality
and
crime
as
to
be
a
veritable
hell
on
but
the
sergeant
said
there
was
a
federal
picket
post
at
the
crossing
of
the
white
her
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
he
merely
supposed
there
would
be
but
even
if
it
were
true
we
have
no
positive
means
of
knowing
that
the
men
stationed
there
would
be
of
the
regular
service
doubtless
these
thieving
murdering
bands
such
as
that
headed
by
red
lowrie
of
whom
you
may
have
heard
are
sufficiently
organized
to
keep
patrols
posted
and
may
indeed
be
utilized
at
times
by
both
armies
for
that
purpose
were
you
to
go
to
them
you
might
be
simply
walking
into
a
den
of
but
could
you
not
go
with
me
i
smiled
at
the
naive
innocence
of
her
query
i
wish
you
to
feel
that
i
have
never
thought
so
much
about
my
own
danger
as
about
yours
i
returned
quietly
but
would
it
be
a
pleasure
even
to
you
to
behold
me
swinging
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
hung
as
a
spy
without
trial
merely
because
i
ventured
to
walk
with
you
into
a
federal
camp
i
could
see
her
eyes
now
resting
full
upon
me
and
much
of
the
hardness
and
doubt
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
them
as
she
scanned
my
uncovered
features
in
the
dim
light
i
scarcely
think
i
was
ever
considered
a
handsome
man
even
by
my
friends
but
i
was
young
then
frank
of
face
with
that
about
me
which
easily
inspired
confidence
and
it
did
me
good
to
note
how
her
eyes
softened
and
to
mark
the
perceptible
tremor
in
her
voice
as
she
cried
impulsively
oh
no
not
that
your
words
yield
me
new
heart
i
replied
fervently
determined
now
that
the
ice
was
partially
broken
to
permit
no
excuse
for
its
again
forming
for
if
you
but
once
fully
realize
our
situation
you
will
certainly
feel
that
i
am
merely
endeavoring
to
perform
my
plain
duty
i
know
not
how
i
could
do
less
without
forfeiting
entirely
your
respect
now
one
thing
more
please
banish
from
your
thought
the
idea
that
you
are
in
any
way
a
prisoner
forget
if
possible
the
color
of
my
uniform
and
think
of
me
simply
as
an
officer
of
equal
rank
and
standing
with
those
you
know
in
your
own
army
one
who
stands
ready
if
need
arise
to
protect
you
with
his
life
as
glad
to
serve
you
as
if
he
wore
the
blue
instead
of
the
i
believed
for
a
moment
my
words
had
appealed
to
her
nobler
nature
that
she
would
outstretch
to
me
her
slightly
uplifted
hand
and
surrender
utterly
but
it
was
only
for
the
moment
whatever
wave
of
emotion
may
have
moved
her
to
the
gesture
it
was
as
suddenly
swept
aside
by
a
return
of
the
old
proud
impetuous
spirit
i
will
of
course
bow
to
the
inevitable
sir
she
said
and
shall
endeavor
to
adapt
myself
to
the
requirements
of
my
unfortunate
situation
may
i
venture
to
inquire
what
you
now
propose
to
do
i
confess
to
experiencing
a
quick
feeling
of
resentment
as
i
turned
to
scan
the
dim
surroundings
not
knowing
at
the
moment
how
best
to
answer
her
who
was
this
girl
that
she
should
continue
to
bear
herself
as
a
disdainful
queen
might
toward
the
very
meanest
of
her
subjects
was
i
so
far
beneath
her
even
in
the
social
scale
as
to
warrant
such
assumption
of
superiority
no
i
felt
that
this
was
not
the
cause
of
her
cold
suspicion
her
proud
unapproachable
bearing
undoubtedly
it
arose
from
the
manner
in
which
she
had
fallen
into
our
hands
the
strangeness
and
delicacy
of
our
situation
the
knowledge
that
i
was
a
rebel
in
arms
against
her
people
these
were
the
things
which
had
reared
such
a
barrier
between
us
she
but
resorted
to
what
was
apparently
her
only
available
weapon
of
defence
well
of
one
thing
and
that
the
most
important
i
was
now
assured
there
would
occur
no
further
struggle
on
her
part
if
not
fully
resigned
to
the
situation
she
at
least
realized
the
necessity
of
obedience
to
my
will
this
was
much
but
now
what
could
i
do
with
her
to
the
right
of
where
we
stood
the
ground
sloped
rapidly
downward
until
the
dense
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
defile
shrouded
everything
from
view
the
descent
appeared
rocky
and
impracticable
and
i
could
distinguish
the
sound
of
rapid
water
far
below
on
the
opposite
side
stood
a
dense
wood
the
outer
fringe
of
trees
overhanging
the
road
and
through
the
waving
leaves
the
moonlight
checkered
the
ground
with
silver
while
the
dense
mass
beyond
seemed
to
flow
back
up
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain
thick
with
underbrush
just
below
us
and
possibly
fifty
feet
from
the
highway
i
could
perceive
a
small
log
cabin
as
silent
gloomy
and
deserted
to
all
outward
appearance
as
were
the
sombre
woods
of
which
it
formed
a
part
there
seems
small
choice
i
said
speaking
as
cheerfully
as
possible
but
i
propose
to
investigate
the
log
hut
yonder
and
learn
if
it
may
not
afford
some
degree
of
she
glanced
furtively
in
the
direction
pointed
out
and
her
eyes
mirrored
the
sudden
fear
that
swept
into
them
oh
no
she
cried
impulsively
i
could
never
venture
into
that
horrible
it
did
indeed
look
uncanny
enough
in
its
black
loneliness
a
fit
abiding
place
for
ghost
and
goblin
damned
but
i
was
not
inclined
to
yield
to
superstitious
dread
certainly
not
i
answered
until
after
i
have
investigated
it
perhaps
it
may
prove
more
attractive
within
than
without
although
i
confess
from
here
it
appears
gloomy
enough
to
discourage
any
one
however
if
you
will
rest
here
in
the
shadow
of
these
trees
i
will
soon
discover
whether
it
has
inmates
or
she
followed
me
in
silence
across
the
road
to
the
spot
designated
but
as
i
turned
to
leave
her
seated
upon
the
grass
and
well
protected
from
prying
eyes
she
hurried
quickly
after
me
and
in
her
agitation
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
touch
my
sleeve
with
her
hand
oh
please
do
not
leave
me
here
alone
i
am
not
naturally
timid
yet
everything
is
so
gloomy
i
can
not
stand
it
let
me
go
with
you
if
you
must
go
most
assuredly
you
shall
if
you
desire
i
returned
heartily
but
really
there
is
not
a
particle
of
danger
in
this
for
if
the
house
were
inhabited
its
occupants
would
have
been
aroused
long
ago
follow
just
behind
me
and
we
shall
soon
solve
the
there
appeared
before
us
a
dim
path
leading
in
among
the
trees
and
following
its
erratic
curves
we
were
soon
before
the
cabin
which
grew
ever
more
uninviting
as
we
drew
near
as
i
paused
a
moment
before
the
closed
door
in
order
that
i
might
listen
for
any
possible
sound
within
i
could
hear
her
quick
breathing
as
though
the
terror
of
the
moment
had
driven
all
else
from
her
mind
do
not
feel
frightened
i
said
seeking
to
reassure
her
there
is
nothing
here
more
terrifying
than
a
vacant
house
doubtless
long
since
deserted
we
shall
discover
nothing
more
formidable
within
than
a
rat
or
the
wooden
latch
yielded
readily
enough
to
my
pressure
and
pushing
wide
open
the
door
which
creaked
slightly
upon
its
rusty
hinges
i
stepped
across
the
puncheon
threshold
onto
the
hard
earthen
floor
there
was
no
window
visible
and
the
slight
reflection
of
moonlight
which
crept
in
through
the
doorway
scarcely
revealed
the
nature
of
that
dark
interior
i
could
dimly
perceive
what
i
believed
to
be
a
table
directly
in
front
of
me
while
certain
other
indistinct
and
ill
defined
shadows
might
be
chairs
pushed
back
against
the
wall
at
least
this
room
was
without
occupants
yet
it
was
with
every
sense
alert
that
i
entered
pressing
slowly
past
the
table
toward
where
i
felt
the
fireplace
would
naturally
be
knowing
that
my
companion
was
yet
with
me
her
hand
clutching
my
arm
oh
she
cried
sharply
in
terror
what
was
that
it
was
something
certainly
a
deadened
muffled
shuffling
sound
directly
in
our
front
followed
by
a
strange
noise
of
scraping
as
if
with
a
dull
knife
on
wood
wait
i
said
sternly
probably
it
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
a
i
felt
my
way
carefully
around
the
table
a
revolver
ready
in
my
hand
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
there
nothing
indeed
in
the
room
for
from
my
new
position
i
could
look
backward
and
distinguish
in
the
moonlight
the
details
of
that
simple
squalid
interior
i
ran
my
hand
along
the
rough
logs
of
the
further
wall
ay
here
was
a
break
doubtless
a
door
and
groping
along
the
crack
i
found
the
latch
there
was
no
longer
any
noise
audible
and
i
drew
the
door
inward
never
dreaming
of
danger
suddenly
with
a
fierce
wild
spring
out
of
the
dark
a
huge
body
hurled
itself
directly
at
my
throat
striking
with
such
headlong
impetus
that
i
went
backward
as
if
shot
crashing
against
the
table
then
to
the
floor
dropping
my
weapon
as
i
fell
there
was
no
noise
no
sound
while
for
an
instant
with
strength
of
sheer
desperation
i
held
back
the
snapping
jaws
that
breathed
hot
fire
into
my
very
face
with
a
bound
backward
of
its
great
body
the
beast
jerked
free
from
my
grip
and
the
next
instant
had
sunk
its
dripping
fangs
deep
and
hard
into
the
flesh
of
my
shoulder
as
the
intense
pain
shot
through
me
my
right
hand
driven
with
all
the
force
i
could
muster
caught
the
monster
once
twice
full
in
the
throat
but
tighter
and
tighter
those
clinched
jaws
locked
until
it
seemed
as
if
every
bone
between
them
must
be
ground
to
powder
even
as
i
grasped
the
lower
jaw
seeking
vainly
to
wrench
it
loose
i
heard
the
girl
scream
in
sudden
afright
quick
i
gasped
desperately
get
my
revolver
there
on
the
floor
and
use
it
but
for
god
sake
keep
down
do
let
the
brute
see
she
must
have
heard
but
there
was
no
response
although
her
crying
ceased
yet
my
own
struggle
to
rid
myself
of
that
crushing
weight
and
those
iron
jaws
drowned
all
other
sounds
drove
all
other
thoughts
from
me
i
doubt
if
what
i
now
record
occupied
a
minute
but
god
protect
me
from
ever
having
to
experience
such
another
minute
i
continued
to
struggle
in
desperate
hopelessness
with
single
hand
in
vain
endeavor
to
wrench
loose
that
awful
grip
upon
my
shoulder
every
movement
i
made
was
an
agony
an
inexpressible
torture
but
the
very
intensity
of
pain
kept
me
from
faintness
as
the
maddened
beast
tore
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
quivering
flesh
with
knee
bent
double
beneath
me
i
succeeded
in
turning
partially
upon
one
side
lifting
the
entire
weight
of
the
animal
as
i
did
so
but
no
degree
of
force
i
could
exert
would
loosen
those
set
jaws
there
was
no
growling
no
savage
snarling
no
sound
of
any
kind
just
that
fierce
desperate
silent
struggle
for
life
in
the
darkness
every
muscle
of
my
body
began
to
weaken
from
the
strain
my
eyes
blurred
faintness
swept
over
me
i
felt
my
brain
reeling
when
there
burst
a
vivid
flash
of
flame
within
a
foot
of
my
face
singeing
my
forehead
then
followed
a
deafening
report
and
the
huge
brute
sprang
backward
with
a
snarl
of
pain
his
teeth
clicking
together
like
cogs
of
steel
then
he
stiffened
and
fell
prone
across
me
a
dead
inert
weight
pinning
me
breathless
to
the
floor
for
the
moment
i
could
do
no
more
than
lie
there
helpless
gasping
for
breath
scarce
conscious
even
of
my
deliverance
then
as
sufficient
strength
returned
for
action
i
rolled
the
body
of
the
dead
brute
off
me
and
lifting
myself
by
aid
of
the
wall
against
which
my
head
rested
looked
about
two
broken
chairs
overturned
upon
the
floor
and
the
shapeless
huddled
body
of
my
late
assailant
alone
spoke
of
the
violence
of
that
deadly
struggle
but
the
cabin
was
yet
full
of
smoke
and
i
could
perceive
the
figure
of
the
girl
leaning
against
the
frame
of
the
open
door
the
revolver
still
grasped
in
her
hand
her
posture
was
that
of
a
frightened
deer
as
her
eyes
sought
the
dark
interior
it
is
safely
over
i
said
weakly
for
my
breath
yet
came
to
me
in
gasps
the
brute
is
and
you
are
not
killed
shall
i
ever
forget
the
glad
ring
in
her
voice
oh
thank
god
thank
god
the
sound
of
these
eager
words
yielded
me
a
fresh
measure
of
life
believe
me
i
certainly
do
i
said
as
cheerfully
as
possible
and
i
thank
you
also
as
his
instrument
but
if
you
would
keep
me
from
fainting
away
like
a
nerveless
woman
i
beg
you
come
i
could
mark
her
coming
across
the
narrow
streak
of
moonlight
moving
toward
me
as
a
frightened
bird
might
startled
at
everything
and
passing
as
far
from
the
lifeless
mass
on
the
floor
as
the
small
space
would
allow
as
she
bent
anxiously
over
me
her
face
was
so
in
shadow
that
i
could
distinguish
nothing
of
its
features
what
is
it
are
you
indeed
severely
hurt
not
seriously
i
think
yet
i
have
lost
some
blood
and
am
in
great
pain
there
is
brandy
in
the
inner
pocket
of
my
jacket
but
i
am
unable
to
move
my
arm
in
order
to
reach
it
would
you
endeavor
to
draw
the
flask
out
i
felt
her
bend
over
me
her
soft
breath
coming
almost
in
sobs
upon
my
face
as
with
trembling
fingers
she
undid
the
buttons
of
my
jacket
and
extracted
the
small
flat
flask
i
had
been
thoughtful
enough
to
store
away
there
the
fiery
liquid
seemed
to
put
new
blood
into
my
veins
and
with
it
there
returned
all
my
audacity
with
that
intense
hopefulness
in
which
i
had
been
trained
by
years
of
war
and
ah
now
i
feel
i
am
myself
once
more
i
exclaimed
cheerily
things
are
surely
not
so
bad
after
all
at
least
we
have
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
another
day
in
which
to
i
felt
her
shudder
oh
please
do
not
make
light
of
it
she
whispered
it
is
so
like
some
horrid
dream
and
i
am
trembling
i
put
my
hand
upon
hers
and
it
was
not
withdrawn
i
trust
you
realize
i
said
that
i
am
neither
thoughtless
nor
ungrateful
years
of
war
service
make
one
careless
of
life
but
i
know
it
was
your
shot
that
saved
me
you
are
a
brave
her
overtaxed
nerves
gave
way
at
my
words
and
i
knew
she
was
crying
softly
the
sobbing
was
in
her
voice
as
she
strove
to
speak
oh
no
i
am
not
you
do
not
guess
how
great
a
coward
i
am
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
was
doing
when
i
fired
that
horrid
thing
what
was
it
a
huge
mastiff
i
imagine
one
of
the
largest
of
his
breed
but
whatever
it
may
have
been
the
beast
is
dead
and
we
have
nothing
more
to
fear
from
yet
i
tremble
so
she
confessed
almost
hysterically
every
shadow
frightens
i
realized
that
no
amount
of
conversation
would
quiet
her
nerves
so
effectively
as
some
positive
action
besides
i
felt
the
hot
blood
constantly
trickling
down
my
arm
and
realized
that
something
needed
to
be
done
at
once
to
stanch
its
flow
before
weakness
should
render
me
equally
useless
do
you
think
you
could
build
a
fire
on
the
hearth
yonder
i
asked
i
am
afraid
i
am
hardly
capable
of
helping
you
as
yet
but
we
must
have
light
in
this
gloomy
old
hole
or
it
is
bound
to
craze
us
both
take
those
broken
chairs
if
you
find
nothing
she
instantly
did
as
i
bade
her
moving
here
and
there
about
the
room
until
she
gathered
together
the
materials
necessary
but
keeping
carefully
away
from
where
the
dead
dog
lay
until
in
a
brief
space
of
time
the
welcome
flame
leaped
up
in
the
wide
black
chimney
and
cast
its
red
glare
all
over
the
little
room
the
activity
did
her
good
the
light
flooding
the
gloomy
apartment
yielded
renewed
courage
and
there
was
a
cheerier
sound
in
her
voice
as
she
came
back
to
me
the
great
ugly
brute
she
exclaimed
looking
at
the
form
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
he
was
certainly
heavy
enough
to
have
been
a
bear
i
replied
clinching
my
teeth
in
pain
and
sufficiently
i
viewed
her
now
for
the
first
time
clearly
and
the
memory
will
remain
with
me
till
i
die
how
distinctly
that
entire
picture
stands
forth
with
the
mist
of
all
these
years
between
the
room
devoid
of
all
furniture
save
of
the
rudest
and
most
primitive
kind
the
bare
logs
forming
the
walls
unrelieved
in
their
rough
ugliness
except
as
here
and
there
sundry
unshapely
garments
dangled
from
wooden
pegs
the
rough
deal
table
with
a
few
cheap
dishes
piled
upon
one
end
of
it
the
dead
dog
lying
across
the
earthen
floor
and
over
all
the
leap
of
flame
as
the
newly
kindled
fire
gathered
way
leaving
weird
shadows
here
and
there
yet
steadily
forcing
them
back
and
flooding
the
whole
interior
with
a
cheery
glow
she
had
flung
aside
the
blue
and
yellow
cloak
which
during
the
long
hours
of
our
night
ride
had
so
completely
shrouded
her
and
stood
before
me
dressed
in
some
soft
clinging
stuff
of
a
delicate
brown
color
so
cut
and
fashioned
as
to
most
become
her
rounded
graceful
form
about
her
neck
a
narrow
strip
of
creamy
lace
was
fitted
the
full
throat
rendered
whiter
by
the
contrast
while
at
her
wrists
a
similar
ornament
alone
served
to
relieve
the
simple
plainness
of
her
attire
the
flaming
fire
lighted
up
her
face
making
it
seem
to
flush
with
the
dancing
glow
which
sparkled
like
diamonds
in
her
eyes
and
touched
with
ruddy
light
the
dark
dishevelled
hair
hers
was
a
young
fair
face
a
face
to
love
and
trust
forever
yet
with
a
pride
in
it
and
a
certain
firmness
also
that
somehow
was
good
to
see
all
this
i
noted
with
one
quick
upward
glance
and
with
a
sudden
thrill
of
the
heart
such
as
i
had
never
known
before
chapter
vii
a
disciple
of
sir
walter
i
have
no
doubt
she
wished
me
to
see
her
thus
every
woman
worth
the
winning
is
a
bit
of
a
coquette
and
none
can
be
utterly
disdainful
of
the
lesson
their
mirror
tells
but
even
as
i
gazed
upon
her
my
admiration
deeper
than
my
pain
the
arch
expression
of
her
face
changed
there
came
a
sudden
rush
of
pity
of
anxiety
into
those
clear
challenging
eyes
and
with
one
quick
step
she
drew
nearer
and
bent
above
me
oh
captain
wayne
she
cried
her
warm
womanly
heart
conquering
all
prejudice
you
are
badly
hurt
and
bleeding
why
did
you
not
tell
me
please
let
me
aid
i
fear
i
must
i
replied
grimly
i
would
gladly
spare
you
for
indeed
i
do
not
believe
my
injury
sufficiently
serious
to
cause
alarm
but
i
find
i
have
only
one
arm
i
can
use
at
present
the
brute
got
his
teeth
into
the
the
tender
compassion
within
her
eyes
was
most
pleasant
to
see
oh
believe
me
i
can
do
she
spoke
bravely
a
sturdy
ring
of
confidence
in
the
voice
although
at
the
thought
her
face
paled
i
have
been
in
the
hospitals
at
baltimore
and
taken
care
of
wounded
soldiers
if
there
was
only
some
water
here
she
glanced
about
dreading
the
possibility
of
having
to
go
forth
into
the
night
alone
in
search
of
a
spring
or
well
i
think
you
will
find
a
pail
on
the
bench
yonder
i
said
for
from
where
i
leaned
against
the
wall
i
could
see
out
into
the
shed
it
was
doubtless
left
for
the
dog
to
drink
she
came
back
with
it
tearing
down
a
cloth
from
off
a
peg
in
the
wall
as
she
passed
and
then
wearing
a
resolute
air
of
authority
knelt
beside
me
and
with
rapid
fingers
flung
back
my
jacket
unfastening
the
rough
army
shirt
and
laid
bare
so
far
as
was
possible
the
lacerated
shoulder
it
gave
me
intense
pain
for
the
shirt
had
become
matted
to
the
wound
by
drying
blood
so
that
in
spite
of
her
soft
touch
and
my
own
clinched
teeth
a
slight
groan
broke
from
my
lips
forgive
me
she
said
anxiously
but
i
fear
i
can
never
dress
it
in
this
way
we
must
remove
your
jacket
and
cut
away
the
sleeve
of
your
it
was
an
agonizing
operation
for
it
has
often
seemed
to
me
that
the
more
superficial
the
wound
the
greater
the
pain
experienced
in
dealing
with
it
and
the
perspiration
stood
in
beads
upon
my
forehead
as
she
worked
quickly
and
with
skill
at
last
the
disagreeable
task
was
accomplished
the
wounded
shoulder
completely
bared
her
face
was
deathly
white
now
and
she
shielded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
oh
what
a
horrible
wound
she
exclaimed
almost
sobbing
how
that
great
brute
must
have
hurt
you
the
wound
is
not
so
serious
as
it
appears
i
replied
reassuringly
and
glad
myself
to
feel
that
i
spoke
the
truth
but
i
confess
the
pain
is
intense
and
makes
me
feel
somewhat
faint
it
was
not
so
much
the
mere
bite
of
the
dog
but
unfortunately
he
got
his
teeth
into
an
old
wound
and
tore
it
an
old
wound
yes
i
received
a
minié
ball
there
at
gettysburg
and
although
the
bullet
was
extracted
the
wound
never
properly
these
words
served
to
recall
to
her
instantly
the
fact
that
i
was
not
of
her
own
people
there
appeared
to
come
again
into
her
manner
that
marked
restraint
which
had
almost
totally
disappeared
during
the
last
few
minutes
not
that
she
failed
in
any
kindness
or
consideration
but
a
growing
reserve
put
check
upon
what
was
fast
becoming
the
intimacy
of
friendship
yet
she
performed
her
disagreeable
task
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
sympathetic
woman
and
as
she
worked
swiftly
and
deftly
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
tears
clinging
to
her
long
lashes
skilfully
the
deep
jagged
gash
was
bathed
out
and
then
as
carefully
bound
up
with
the
softest
cloths
she
could
find
at
hand
the
relief
was
great
and
i
felt
as
i
moved
the
shoulder
that
saving
the
soreness
it
would
probably
not
greatly
bother
me
now
you
must
lie
back
and
rest
she
said
as
i
attempted
to
thank
her
here
put
your
head
on
this
cloak
but
first
it
will
do
you
good
to
have
more
of
the
brandy
for
you
are
as
white
as
merely
a
slight
faintness
and
i
will
only
consent
to
indulge
provided
you
partake
first
for
i
know
you
require
the
stimulant
as
much
as
i
i
retorted
doggedly
gazing
up
into
her
face
with
an
admiration
she
could
scarcely
fail
to
perceive
she
lifted
the
flask
to
her
lips
and
did
not
answer
but
when
she
handed
it
back
to
me
there
was
a
new
flush
upon
her
cheeks
and
now
as
your
nurse
i
command
absolute
quiet
striving
to
speak
gaily
see
the
daylight
is
already
here
and
i
mean
to
discover
if
this
lone
cabin
contains
anything
which
human
beings
can
eat
i
confess
that
i
am
nearly
a
most
excellent
symptom
and
i
imagine
your
quest
will
not
be
wholly
vain
to
my
eye
that
greatly
resembles
a
slab
of
bacon
hanging
beside
the
it
indeed
is
she
exclaimed
and
i
feel
as
a
shipwrecked
seaman
must
on
first
beholding
however
my
naturally
energetic
spirit
revolted
at
inactivity
for
the
time
being
my
faintness
precluded
any
thought
of
doing
other
than
obeying
her
orders
and
i
lay
there
silent
propped
up
against
the
logs
my
eager
eyes
following
her
rapid
graceful
movements
with
a
constantly
increasing
interest
as
she
worked
the
reflection
of
the
red
flames
became
mingled
with
the
gray
dawn
until
the
bare
and
cheerless
interior
grew
more
and
more
visible
her
search
was
far
from
unsuccessful
while
her
resourcefulness
astonished
me
old
campaigner
as
i
was
for
it
was
scarcely
more
than
full
daylight
before
she
had
me
at
the
table
and
i
was
doing
full
justice
to
such
coarse
food
as
the
larder
furnished
a
confederate
soldier
in
those
days
could
not
well
afford
to
affect
delicacy
in
matters
of
the
cuisine
and
indeed
our
long
fast
had
left
us
both
where
any
kind
of
food
was
most
welcome
the
eating
helped
me
greatly
but
for
some
time
so
busy
were
we
that
neither
of
us
spoke
on
my
own
part
i
experienced
a
strange
hesitancy
in
addressing
her
upon
terms
of
equality
ordinarily
not
easily
embarrassed
in
feminine
society
i
felt
in
this
instance
a
definite
barrier
between
us
which
prevented
my
feeling
at
ease
now
and
then
as
we
sat
opposite
each
other
eating
amid
a
silence
most
unpleasant
i
would
catch
her
eyes
glancing
across
at
me
but
they
were
lowered
instantly
whenever
i
ventured
to
meet
them
finally
i
broke
the
stillness
with
a
commonplace
remark
i
presume
your
people
will
be
greatly
worried
by
this
time
over
your
mysterious
a
flush
swept
her
throat
and
cheeks
but
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
from
the
plate
yes
she
answered
slowly
frank
is
doubtless
searching
for
me
long
before
frank
i
asked
feeling
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
learn
more
of
her
relationships
you
forget
possibly
that
your
friends
are
strange
to
me
you
refer
to
the
gentleman
who
expected
to
meet
you
on
the
road
to
major
brennan
there
was
nothing
about
the
tone
of
her
reply
that
invited
me
to
press
the
inquiry
further
one
thing
however
was
reasonably
certain
the
man
she
called
frank
could
not
be
her
father
i
longed
to
ask
if
he
was
a
brother
but
the
restraint
of
her
whole
manner
repelled
the
suggestion
did
i
understand
that
you
have
nursed
in
the
federal
hospitals
at
baltimore
i
questioned
more
to
continue
the
conversation
than
from
any
deep
interest
merely
as
a
volunteer
and
when
the
regular
nurses
were
especially
busy
major
brennan
was
stationed
there
for
some
time
when
i
first
visited
him
and
i
felt
it
my
duty
as
a
loyal
woman
to
aid
the
poor
it
was
surely
far
from
being
an
agreeable
task
to
one
of
your
oh
it
was
not
that
that
made
it
so
hard
and
her
eyes
were
upon
me
now
unflinchingly
it
was
the
constant
sight
of
so
much
misery
one
was
unable
to
relieve
besides
that
was
nearly
a
year
ago
i
was
very
young
just
from
school
and
every
form
of
suffering
was
new
and
terrible
to
i
greatly
wonder
you
were
permitted
to
go
there
at
the
major
did
object
he
insisted
it
was
no
fit
place
for
me
and
that
i
ran
the
risk
of
contracting
disease
but
i
generally
have
my
own
way
even
with
him
and
in
this
case
i
felt
it
a
duty
to
my
country
and
that
i
was
right
in
my
i
remained
silent
striving
vainly
to
frame
some
innocent
question
which
should
solve
for
me
the
problem
of
who
and
what
she
was
suddenly
she
spoke
softly
captain
wayne
i
feel
i
owe
you
an
apology
for
my
unwarranted
and
unladylike
conduct
last
night
i
am
very
sure
now
that
you
are
a
gentleman
and
will
appreciate
how
bitterly
i
was
tried
how
deeply
i
have
ever
since
regretted
it
hurt
her
pride
to
say
even
this
much
as
i
could
tell
by
her
downcast
eyes
and
heaving
bosom
and
i
hastened
to
relieve
her
embarrassment
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
ask
forgiveness
for
i
said
earnestly
rather
such
a
request
should
come
from
me
i
only
trust
miss
brennan
that
you
will
excuse
my
part
in
this
extremely
unfortunate
she
sat
looking
down
upon
her
plate
her
fingers
nervously
crumbling
a
bit
of
corn
bread
you
do
not
even
know
who
i
am
she
said
slowly
i
am
not
miss
but
i
felt
as
if
a
dash
of
cold
water
had
been
suddenly
thrown
in
my
face
indeed
i
stammered
scarcely
knowing
what
i
said
you
appear
so
young
a
girl
that
i
never
once
thought
of
you
as
being
a
married
i
was
married
very
early
indeed
before
i
was
seventeen
my
husband
what
she
was
about
to
add
i
could
but
conjecture
for
a
quick
change
in
the
expression
of
her
face
startled
me
what
is
it
i
questioned
half
rising
to
my
feet
and
glancing
over
my
shoulder
toward
the
wall
where
her
eyes
were
riveted
something
resembling
a
hand
pushed
aside
the
coat
hanging
yonder
she
explained
in
low
trembling
tone
and
i
thought
i
saw
a
with
one
stride
i
was
across
the
narrow
room
and
tore
the
garment
from
its
wooden
hook
the
log
wall
where
it
hung
was
blank
i
struck
it
here
and
there
with
the
steel
hilt
of
my
sabre
but
it
returned
a
perfectly
solid
sound
and
i
glanced
about
bewildered
the
woman
was
watching
me
with
affrighted
eyes
this
entire
house
is
uncanny
she
exclaimed
the
very
being
in
it
makes
my
flesh
creep
it
may
have
been
a
den
of
murderers
captain
let
us
get
outside
into
the
believing
it
to
be
merely
her
overwrought
nerves
which
were
at
fault
i
sought
to
soothe
her
it
was
probably
no
more
than
a
shadow
i
said
crossing
to
her
side
of
the
table
to
enable
her
better
to
feel
the
influence
of
my
presence
let
us
be
content
to
sit
here
by
the
door
for
we
should
be
taking
too
great
a
risk
of
discovery
if
we
ventured
into
the
i
had
barely
spoken
these
words
and
placed
my
fingers
on
her
hand
to
lead
her
forward
when
the
small
door
which
opened
into
the
shed
was
thrown
back
noisily
and
two
great
shaggy
dogs
the
evident
mates
of
the
dead
brute
at
our
feet
leaped
fiercely
in
she
shrank
toward
me
with
a
sob
of
terror
but
even
as
i
drew
a
revolver
from
my
belt
a
man
and
a
woman
appeared
almost
simultaneously
in
that
same
opening
down
douglas
down
roderick
ha
lies
red
murdoch
stark
and
stiff
down
you

the
man
strode
forward
as
he
spoke
clubbing
the
frenzied
brutes
with
the
stock
of
the
long
rifle
he
carried
on
the
view
the
opening
pack
he
quoted
as
he
distributed
his
blows
impartially
to
right

left

ter
he
redoubled
his
efforts
for
peace
finally
driving
the
rebellious
beasts
back
into
one
corner
where
they
sat
upon
their
haunches
and
eyed
us
wistfully
dogs
of
black
saint
hubert
breed
unmatched
for
courage
breath
and
speed
he
exclaimed
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
with
the
back
of
one
hand
and
staring
at
us
specially
the
he
was
a
little
fellow
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
in
size
with
round
red
face
full
of
strange
wrinkles
and
head
as
oddly
as
i
ever
looked
upon
it
went
up
exactly
like
the
apex
of
a
pear
while
the
upper
portion
was
utterly
bald
he
formed
a
most
remarkable
contrast
to
the
tall
angular
female
who
loomed
up
like
a
small
mountain
just
behind
him

as
how
you

a

of
a

said

she
caught
the

unceremoniously
by
one
arm
and
thrusting
him
roughly
to
one
side
strode
heavily
forward
until
she
paused
in
the
centre
of
the
room
facing
us
with
her
arms
akimbo
now
i
jist
like
ter
know
she
said
savagely

the
wrinkled
red
face
peering
cautiously
around
her
ample
waist
line
made
me
wish
to
laugh
but
an
earnest
desire
to
placate
the
irate
female
who
was
evidently
the
real
head
of
this
household
enabled
me
to
conquer
the
inclination
and
answer
gravely
madam
i
said
with
a
low
bow
it

misfortune

which
has
caused

hospitality

will
very

i

in

and
the
breaking
down
of
our

compelled
us
to
take
refuge
here
in
order
that
this
lady
might
not
be
exposed
to
danger
from
roving
gangs

turned
back
to
us
and
from
her
first
words
it
was
plainly
evident
she
had
been
impressed
with
but
one
sentence
of
my
labored
explanation
did
you

evidence
of

consider

grim

relaxed
slightly

permitted

turned
on

crept

glanced
at

the
amused
twinkle
in

eyes
led
me
to
say
heartily
we
had
not
entirely
completed
our
meal
but
imagined
we

beneath

as
he
came
down
but
the
little
man
not
in

daunted
picked
up
his
knife
and
fork
with
a
sigh
of
relief

in

to
draw

chair
once
more
to

table
and
i
sat
down
beside
her
you

confederate
then
i
asked
curious
to
know
upon
which
side
his
sympathies
were
enlisted
in
the
struggle
he
glanced
warily
at
my
gray
jacket
then
his
shrewd
shifty
eyes
wandered
to
the
blue
and
yellow
cavalry
cloak
lying
on

his

on

face

turned
about

she
stood
beside
the
fireplace

he
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
at
her
but
before
i
could
turn
about
in
my
chair
one
of
the
great
dogs
began
to
growl
savagely
and
maria
sprang
forward
and
cuffed
the
surly
brutes
into
rebellious
silence
it
hosses
she
said
harshly

not

two
lovely
females
fer
ye
ter
as
i
hastily
sprang
to
my
feet
i
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
out
of
the
partially
opened
door
down
the
steep
of
the
hill
road
there
was
slowly
moving
toward
us
on
foot
a
small
party
of
perhaps
a
dozen
men
so
variously
clothed
as
to
make
it
evident
they
were
irregulars
just
ahead
of
them
but
on
horseback
two
others
were
even
then
turning
into
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
the
house
attracted
probably
by
the
smoke
which
streamed
from
the
chapter
viii
bungay
defends
her
hearthstone
a
hand
pressing
hard
upon
my
arm
brought
back
my
scattered
senses
with
a
rush
it
was
brennan
who
stood
there
her
face
whitened
by
anxiety
her
eyes
peering
anxiously
through
the
opening
of
the
door
imminent
danger
may
startle
even
a
trained
soldier
but
any
necessity
for
action
always
recalls
him
to
duty
and
that
one
glance
at
her
sufficed
to
make
me
myself
again
surely
those
men
are
not
soldiers
captain
wayne
she
exclaimed
they
wear
uniforms
of
both
no
doubt
they
are
guerillas
i
answered
drawing
her
back
from
where
she
might
be
seen
in
their
approach
we
must
find
hiding
if
possible
for
you
shall
never
fall
into
such
hands
bungay
i
turned
toward
where
the
little
giant
had
been
sitting
but
he
was
not
to
be
seen
however
the
sound
of
my
voice
aroused
maria
to
a
full
sense
of
our
danger
nor
was
she
a
woman
to
hesitate
in
such
emergency
with
a
single
stride
she
crossed
the
narrow
room
caught
the
hero
by
the
collar
of
his
shirt
dragged
him
ignominiously
forth
from
beneath
the
table
where
he
had
sought
refuge
shook
him
as
she
would
shake
a
toy
dog
until
his
teeth
rattled
and
then
flung
him
out
of
the
door
leading
into
the
back
shed
it
was
done
so
expeditiously
that
i
could
only
gasp
now
inter
ther
hole
with
ye
jed
bungay
you
an
yer
dorgs
she
panted
furiously
an
you
uns
foller
him
i
reckon
i
able
ter
handle
thet
lot
out
thar
even
if
it
should
be
red
lowrie
an
his
catching
firm
hold
of
brennan
hand
i
sprang
down
the
single
step
and
closed
the
door
tight
behind
us
jed
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
rubbing
himself
vigorously
with
one
hand
utilized
the
other
to
drag
outward
a
rough
cupboard
which
appeared
to
be
a
portion
of
the
house
itself
as
it
swung
open
there
was
revealed
behind
it
a
opening
extending
into
the
face
of
the
hill
it
was
a
most
ingenious
arrangement
doubtless
finding
frequent
use
in
those
troublesome
times
its
presence
partially
explained
how
jed
had
thus
far
escaped
the
conscription
officer
into
this
hole
we
entered
one
at
a
time
and
when
the
heavy
cupboard
had
been
silently
drawn
back
into
place
found
ourselves
enveloped
in
such
total
darkness
as
to
make
any
movement
a
dangerous
operation
i
felt
the
clasp
of
my
companion
hand
tighten
and
knew
that
her
whole
form
was
trembling
from
intense
excitement
do
not
permit
the
darkness
to
alarm
you
i
whispered
softly
bending
down
as
i
spoke
until
i
could
feel
her
quick
breathing
against
my
cheek
our
visitors
are
not
likely
to
remain
longer
than
will
be
necessary
to
get
something
to
eat
they
need
never
suspect
our
presence
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
wait
patiently
until
they
move
on
i
only
wish
i
could
discover
something
upon
which
you
might
sit
pray
do
not
think
me
a
coward
she
answered
but
i
have
heard
of
this
man
lowrie
in
the
federal
camps
and
i
would
rather
die
than
fall
into
his
i
had
heard
of
him
also
and
of
his
outrageous
treatment
of
women
the
memory
caused
me
to
clasp
my
hand
warmly
over
hers
and
set
my
teeth
hard
it
may
not
prove
to
be
lowrie
at
all
i
said
soberly
but
all
these
gentry
are
pretty
much
alike
i
fear
however
i
promise
that
you
shall
never
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
any
of
their
before
she
could
answer
me
other
than
by
a
slight
nestling
closer
in
the
darkness
bungay
whispered
this
yere
hole
cap
leads
down
ter
the
right
an
comes
out
in
a
sort
o
gully
a
hundred
feet
back
thar
light
ter
see
ter
walk
by
ye
turn
ther
corner
twenty
feet
er
so
you
uns
kin
go
on
down
thar
if
ye
rather
follerin
ther
dorgs
but
i
reckon
as
how
i
stay
right
yere
sorter
see
how
ther
ol
woman
comes
out
where
was
roderick
then
one
blast
upon
his
bugle
horn
were
worth
a
thousand
men
if
you
uns
like
ter
see
a
durned
good
fight
maybe
ye
better
stay
tew
ther
ol
woman
is
pisen
if
she
once
gits
her
dander
his
voice
was
expressive
of
great
expectations
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
his
faith
in
maria
would
be
justified
before
any
of
us
however
had
time
to
change
our
positions
we
heard
the
fellows
come
stamping
roughly
into
the
cabin
the
thin
slabs
which
divided
us
scarcely
muffled
their
loud
voices
well
old
woman
exclaimed
one
in
voice
so
gruff
as
to
seem
almost
assumed
pretending
to
be
alone
are
you
with
all
those
dishes
sitting
out
on
the
table
just
been
eaten
off
too
have
seen
no
strange
party
along
the
road
this
morning
have
ye
nary
a
one
said
maria
and
i
knew
from
her
voice
she
was
standing
close
beside
the
fireplace
are
you
bungay
i
reckon
i
am
if
it
any
o
yer
do
git
hifty
old
woman
or
we
liable
to
give
you
a
lesson
in
politeness
before
we
the
leader
dropped
the
butt
of
his
gun
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
where
is
the
little
sneak
anyhow
what
do
you
want
of
him
want
him
to
go
with
us
we
hunting
some
parties
and
need
a
guide
they
tol
us
up
the
road
a
bit
he
knew
every
inch
o
these
yere
there
was
a
pause
as
if
maria
was
endeavoring
to
decide
as
to
the
honesty
of
the
speaker
her
final
answer
proved
the
mental
survey
had
not
proven
satisfactory
wal
i
reckon
she
said
calmly
as
you
uns
be
more
likely
ter
find
him
down
then
whut
all
these
yere
dirty
dishes
doing
on
the
table
hed
sum
yankee
officers
yere
they
just
rode
on
down
ther
trail
as
you
uns
cum
like
hell
ejaculated
the
fellow
with
complete
loss
of
temper
see
here
old
woman
we
too
old
birds
to
be
caught
with
any
such
chaff
we
take
a
look
around
the
old
shebang
anyhow
and
while
we
at
it
you
put
something
on
the
table
for
me
and
my
mates
to
the
voice
and
manner
were
rough
but
i
was
impressed
with
a
certain
accent
creeping
into
the
man
speech
bespeaking
education
more
in
spite
of
an
apparent
effort
to
make
it
so
his
dialect
was
not
that
of
those
mountains
even
as
he
uttered
these
last
words
throwing
into
them
a
threat
more
in
the
tone
than
the
language
i
became
aware
of
a
thin
ray
of
light
penetrating
the
seemingly
solid
wall
just
in
front
of
me
and
bending
silently
forward
could
dimly
distinguish
the
elliptical
head
of
bungay
as
he
applied
one
eye
to
a
small
opening
he
had
industriously
made
between
the
logs
grasping
brennan
firmly
by
the
hand
so
that
we
should
not
become
separated
i
crept
across
the
intervening
blackness
and
reached
his
side
holy
smoke
cap
the
little
man
muttered
in
suppressed
excitement
as
he
realized
my
presence
it
a
goin
ter
be
hot
in
thar
mighty
soon
mariar
steam
is
a
he
silently
made
room
for
me
and
bending
down
so
as
to
bring
my
eye
upon
a
level
with
his
i
managed
to
gain
some
slight
glimpse
of
the
scene
within
the
cabin
bungay
stood
with
her
back
to
the
fireplace
an
iron
skillet
firmly
gripped
in
one
hand
her
face
was
red
with
indignation
and
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
together
with
a
defiant
set
to
her
chin
which
promised
trouble
in
front
of
her
carelessly
resting
on
the
table
his
feet
dangling
in
the
air
was
a
fellow
of
forty
or
so
with
red
straggling
beard
covering
all
the
lower
half
of
his
face
and
a
black
hat
pulled
so
low
as
almost
to
conceal
his
eyes
his
attire
was
nondescript
as
though
he
had
patronized
the
of
both
armies
in
his
belt
were
thrust
a
revolver
and
a
knife
while
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
a
musket
leaned
against
a
chair
two
others
of
the
party
younger
men
but
even
more
roughly
dressed
than
their
leader
were
lounging
between
him
and
the
door
bungay
chuckled
expectantly
o
lord
if
they
only
git
the
ol
gal
just
a
little
more
riled
he
whispered
hoarsely
jumping
up
and
down
on
one
foot
in
his
excitement
they
hev
ther
fight
of
their
do
you
know
the
fellows
i
asked
is
that
red
lowrie
he
shook
his
head
never
laid
eyes
on
any
of
afore
but
ye
bet
they
no
good
reckon
they
a
part
o
his
the
man
who
posed
as
the
leader
of
the
party
picked
up
the
empty
beside
him
and
shook
it
come
now
bungay
he
commanded
i
tell
you
we
hungry
so
trot
out
some
hoecake
and
fill
up
this
pot
unless
you
want
to
reckon
with
red
the
woman
stood
facing
him
yet
never
moved
i
could
see
a
red
spot
begin
to
glow
in
either
cheek
if
i
had
ever
doubted
it
i
knew
now
that
maria
possessed
a
temper
of
her
own
you
ai
no
red
lowrie
she
retorted
the
fellow
laughed
easily
no
more
i
ai
old
woman
but
i
reckon
we
ai
so
durn
far
apart
when
it
comes
to
getting
what
we
go
after
come
honest
now
where
is
the
little
cur
that
runs
this
shebang
whatever
maria
might
venture
to
call
her
lord
and
master
in
the
privacy
of
home
it
evidently
did
not
soothe
her
spirit
to
hear
him
thus
spoken
of
by
another
if
jed
bungay
wus
hum
she
answered
fiercely
her
eyes
fairly
blazing
i
reckon
you
would
be
sprawlin
on
thet
thar
table
fer
would
i
now
well
old
hen
we
fooled
here
with
you
about
as
long
as
i
care
to
bill
go
over
there
and
put
some
of
that
bacon
on
to
fry
if
she
does
get
out
of
the
way
i
give
her
something
to
jump
and
he
patted
the
stock
of
his
gun
instinctively
i
drew
my
revolver
and
pushed
its
black
muzzle
into
the
light
under
jed
nose
shall
i
give
him
a
dose
i
asked
eagerly
not
yit
o
lord
not
yit
he
exclaimed
dancing
from
one
foot
to
the
other
in
excitement
let
ther
ol
gal
hev
a
show
i
reckon
she
good
fer
ther
whole
three
of
they
bill
came
up
grinning
he
evidently
anticipated
some
fun
and
as
he
reached
out
a
grimy
hand
for
the
slab
of
bacon
took
occasion
to
make
some
remark
what
it
was
i
could
not
hear
but
i
noted
the
quick
responsive
flash
in
the
woman
eyes
and
the
next
instant
with
a
crash
she
brought
the
iron
skillet
down
with
all
her
strength
on
top
of
the
fellow
head
without
even
a
groan
he
went
plunging
down
face
foremost
in
front
of
the
fire
in
another
moment
she
was
battling
like
a
wild
fury
with
the
other
two
it
was
a
quick
intense
struggle
the
man
near
the
door
chanced
to
be
the
first
in
and
he
received
a
blow
from
the
skillet
that
most
assuredly
would
have
crushed
his
skull
had
he
not
dodged
as
it
was
it
landed
upon
his
shoulder
and
he
reeled
back
sick
and
helpless
by
this
time
the
fellow
with
the
red
beard
had
closed
upon
her
and
wrested
the
skillet
from
her
hand
struggling
fiercely
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
maria
tripped
over
the
body
of
the
dead
dog
and
fell
but
as
she
did
so
her
fingers
grasped
the
red
beard
of
her
antagonist
it
yielded
to
her
hand
and
bare
of
face
save
for
a
dark
moustache
the
man
stood
there
panting
for
breath
above
her
then
suddenly
almost
at
my
very
ear
a
voice
cried
frank
frank
i
am
here
chapter
ix
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
in
the
first
surprise
of
that
unexpected
joyful
cry
ringing
at
my
very
ears
all
my
senses
seemed
confused
and
i
stood
motionless
then
i
heard
bungay
utter
a
smothered
oath
and
knew
he
had
wheeled
about
in
the
darkness
unable
to
distinguish
the
slightest
outline
of
his
figure
i
was
yet
impressed
with
the
thought
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
muffle
the
girl
to
prevent
her
uttering
a
second
cry
impelled
by
this
intuition
i
flung
out
my
arm
hastily
and
by
rare
good
luck
it
came
in
contact
with
his
hand
none
of
that
you
little
cur
i
muttered
sternly
unmindful
of
his
efforts
to
break
away
no
hand
on
her
mind
you
brennan
what
does
this
mean
she
made
no
attempt
to
answer
but
i
could
hear
her
now
groping
her
way
through
the
darkness
toward
the
place
of
our
entrance
bungay
detected
the
movement
also
and
made
a
violent
effort
to
break
loose
from
my
grip
that
he
might
hurry
after
her
you
lit
go
o
me
he
cried
excitedly
er
by
goir
i
use
a
knife
she
give
this
whole
thing
away
if
she
ever
gits
for
answer
i
hurled
him
backward
with
all
my
strength
and
sprang
after
the
fleeing
woman
but
i
was
already
too
late
to
stop
her
even
had
that
been
my
intention
with
strength
yielded
her
by
desperation
she
thrust
aside
the
heavy
cupboard
and
as
the
light
swept
in
sprang
forward
into
the
rude
shed
with
another
bound
gathering
her
skirts
as
she
ran
she
was
up
the
steps
and
had
burst
into
the
outer
room
a
moment
later
i
also
stood
in
the
doorway
gazing
upon
a
scene
that
made
my
blood
like
fire
the
fighting
had
evidently
ceased
suddenly
with
her
first
cry
maria
stood
panting
in
one
corner
the
deadly
skillet
again
in
her
hand
her
hair
hanging
in
wisps
down
her
back
still
unconscious
from
the
blow
he
had
received
one
fellow
lay
outstretched
on
the
floor
his
head
barely
missing
the
hot
ashes
of
the
fireplace
while
his
companion
nursed
his
bruises
and
scowled
from
a
safe
refuge
behind
the
table
the
unshaven
faces
of
several
others
of
the
gang
were
peering
curiously
in
through
the
open
door
i
know
now
i
saw
all
this
for
the
picture
of
it
is
upon
the
retina
of
memory
but
at
the
moment
everything
i
appeared
to
perceive
or
hear
occurred
in
the
centre
of
the
room
the
man
who
had
posed
as
the
leader
stood
there
alone
facing
us
his
expression
a
strange
mixture
of
amazement
and
delight
he
was
a
powerfully
built
man
with
keen
gray
eyes
deeply
set
in
their
sockets
his
right
hand
rested
heavily
upon
the
hilt
of
a
cavalry
sabre
the
scabbard
of
which
was
concealed
beneath
the
folds
of
the
long
brown
coat
he
wore
as
brennan
burst
through
the
doorway
he
stepped
eagerly
forward
his
eyes
brightening
and
they
met
with
clasped
hands
is
it
possible
edith
he
cried
as
if
the
recognition
could
scarcely
be
credited
oh
frank
she
exclaimed
eagerly
it
seems
all
too
good
to
be
true
how
came
you
here
hunting
after
you
my
fair
lady
did
you
suppose
you
could
disappear
as
mysteriously
as
you
did
last
night
without
my
being
early
on
the
trail
have
these
people
injured
you
in
any
way
and
he
glanced
about
him
with
a
threat
in
his
gesture
oh
no
frank
hastily
every
one
has
been
most
kind
it
was
a
mere
mistake
but
how
strangely
you
are
dressed
how
very
rough
you
look
he
laughed
but
still
retained
his
warm
clasp
of
her
hands
not
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
which
you
expected
girl
he
asked
lightly
but
we
have
all
sorts
of
conditions
to
meet
down
here
and
soon
learn
in
rome
to
do
as
the
romans
as
he
finished
speaking
he
perceived
me
for
the
first
time
and
his
face
changed
instantly
into
cold
sternness
i
saw
him
sweep
one
hasty
glance
around
as
though
he
suspected
that
i
might
not
be
alone
and
his
hand
fell
once
more
upon
his
sword
hilt
in
posture
suggestive
of
readiness
for
action
who
have
we
here
he
asked
staring
at
me
in
amazement
a
johnny
reb
whatever
i
am
i
retorted
my
gorge
rising
suddenly
at
his
contemptuous
term
and
stepping
out
into
the
room
before
him
i
at
least
wear
the
uniform
of
my
service
and
rank
and
not
the
nondescript
garments
of
a
the
scornful
words
stung
him
i
noticed
the
quick
flush
of
anger
in
his
eyes
and
was
not
sorry
you
are
insolent
sir
moreover
you
go
too
far
for
as
it
chances
you
are
well
within
our
lines
and
we
will
see
to
what
extent
honor
is
consistent
with
the
work
of
a
spy
the
uniform
of
your
service
indeed
he
echoed
hotly
pointing
as
he
spoke
across
the
room
that
cavalry
cloak
over
yonder
tells
its
own
story
peters
steele
arrest
this
frank
do
do
that
she
urged
earnestly
you
mistake
that
was
the
cloak
i
if
he
heard
her
he
gave
no
sign
bind
him
was
the
stern
order
as
the
two
men
advanced
use
your
belts
if
you
have
nothing
else
angry
as
i
most
assuredly
was
swept
also
by
a
new
emotion
which
i
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
i
yet
fully
realized
the
utter
helplessness
of
my
position
in
point
of
resistance
they
were
twenty
to
one
however
much
i
longed
to
grapple
with
him
who
mocked
me
the
very
thought
was
insanity
my
only
possible
chance
of
escape
lay
in
flight
to
realize
this
was
to
act
i
leaped
backward
trusting
for
a
clear
field
in
my
rear
and
an
opportunity
to
run
for
it
but
the
door
by
which
i
had
just
entered
was
now
closed
and
barred
bungay
had
made
sure
his
retreat
the
man
watching
my
every
movement
with
sword
half
drawn
in
his
hand
saw
instantly
that
i
was
securely
trapped
and
laughed
in
scorn
you
are
not
making
war
on
women
now
he
said
with
a
cutting
sneer
you
will
not
find
me
so
easy
a
the
taunt
stung
me
but
more
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
speaker
and
the
hot
blood
of
youth
cast
all
caution
to
the
winds
with
a
single
spring
forgetful
of
my
own
wound
i
was
at
his
throat
dashed
aside
his
uplifted
hand
and
by
the
sheer
audacity
of
my
sudden
unexpected
onset
bore
him
back
crashing
to
the
floor
he
struggled
gamely
yet
i
possessed
the
advantage
of
position
and
would
have
punished
him
severely
but
for
the
dozen
strong
hands
which
instantly
laid
hold
upon
me
and
dragged
me
off
still
fighting
madly
although
as
helpless
as
a
child
my
opponent
instantly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
started
forward
drawing
a
revolver
as
he
came
his
face
was
deathly
white
from
passion
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
told
me
he
would
be
restrained
now
by
no
rule
of
war
you
cowardly
spy
he
cried
and
my
ears
caught
the
sharp
click
as
he
drew
back
the
hammer
do
you
think
i
will
let
that
blow
go
unavenged
i
assuredly
trust
not
i
answered
gazing
up
at
him
from
behind
the
gun
muzzles
with
which
i
was
yet
securely
pinned
to
the
floor
but
if
you
are
as
i
am
led
to
believe
a
federal
officer
with
some
pretensions
to
being
also
a
gentleman
and
not
the
outlaw
your
clothes
proclaim
you
will
at
least
permit
me
to
stand
upon
my
feet
and
face
you
as
a
man
if
i
am
a
spy
as
you
seem
inclined
to
claim
there
are
army
courts
to
try
me
if
not
then
i
am
your
equal
in
standing
and
rank
and
have
every
right
of
a
prisoner
of
this
has
become
personal
hoarsely
your
blow
as
well
as
your
connection
with
the
forcible
abduction
of
this
young
lady
whose
legal
protector
i
am
are
not
matters
to
be
settled
by
an
army
then
permit
me
to
meet
you
in
any
satisfactory
way
the
murder
of
a
helpless
man
will
scarcely
clarify
your
i
knew
from
the
unrelenting
expression
upon
his
face
that
my
plea
was
likely
to
prove
a
perfectly
useless
one
but
before
i
had
ended
it
brennan
stood
between
us
frank
she
said
calmly
you
shall
not
this
man
is
a
confederate
officer
he
is
no
spy
and
during
all
the
events
of
last
night
he
has
proven
himself
a
friend
rather
than
an
enemy
only
for
my
sake
is
he
here
ignoring
the
look
upon
his
face
she
turned
toward
me
impetuously
waved
aside
the
fellows
who
yet
held
me
prostrate
and
extending
her
hand
lifted
me
to
my
feet
for
an
instant
as
if
by
accident
our
eyes
met
and
a
sudden
flush
swept
across
her
throat
and
cheeks
it
is
my
turn
now
she
whispered
softly
so
softly
the
words
did
not
carry
beyond
my
own
ears
then
she
stood
erect
between
us
as
though
in
her
own
and
gravely
presented
us
to
each
other
as
if
she
dared
either
to
quarrel
longer
in
her
presence
major
brennan
captain
we
bowed
to
each
other
as
men
salute
on
the
duelling
field
in
his
eyes
i
read
an
unforgiveness
a
bitter
personal
enmity
which
i
returned
with
interest
and
secretly
rejoiced
over
the
lady
seems
to
be
in
control
at
present
he
said
shortly
shoving
back
the
revolver
into
his
belt
nevertheless
i
shall
do
my
military
duty
and
hold
you
as
a
prisoner
may
i
inquire
your
full
name
and
rank
philip
wayne
captain
th
virginia
cavalry
shirtley
why
are
you
within
our
lines
i
attempted
to
pass
through
them
last
night
with
despatches
but
was
prevented
by
my
desire
to
be
of
assistance
to
this
indeed
he
smiled
incredulously
your
tale
is
quite
interesting
and
rather
romantic
i
presume
you
yet
carry
the
papers
with
you
as
evidence
of
its
truth
if
you
refer
to
the
despatches
i
do
not
i
sincerely
trust
they
are
already
safely
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
one
for
whom
they
were
a
malignant
look
crept
into
brennan
face
and
his
jaws
set
ominously
you
will
have
to
concoct
a
far
better
story
than
that
my
friend
before
you
face
sheridan
he
said
insolently
or
you
will
be
very
apt
to
learn
how
a
rope
feels
he
is
not
inclined
to
parley
long
with
such
fellows
as
you
bind
his
hands
men
and
take
him
out
with
you
into
the
the
two
soldiers
grasped
me
instantly
at
the
word
of
command
for
a
single
moment
i
braced
myself
to
resist
but
even
as
i
did
so
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
slight
opening
in
the
wall
and
i
caught
a
quick
glimpse
of
bungay
face
his
finger
to
his
lips
even
as
i
gazed
in
astonishment
at
this
sudden
apparition
a
lighter
touch
rested
pleadingly
on
my
arm
do
not
struggle
any
longer
captain
wayne
spoke
brennan
voice
gently
i
will
go
to
general
sheridan
myself
and
tell
him
the
entire
i
bowed
to
her
and
held
out
my
hands
to
be
bound
i
yield
myself
your
prisoner
madam
i
said
meaningly
and
not
unconscious
that
her
glance
sank
before
mine
i
even
imagine
the
bonds
may
prove
not
altogether
brennan
strode
between
us
hastily
and
with
quick
gesture
to
his
men
bind
the
fellow
he
said
sternly
and
mind
you
sir
one
word
more
and
they
shall
buck
you
as
well
it
may
be
valuable
for
you
to
remember
that
i
am
in
command
here
however
i
may
seem
to
yield
to
the
wish
of
chapter
x
a
woman
tenderness
youth
is
never
largely
given
to
reflection
which
is
the
gift
of
years
and
although
my
life
had
in
a
measure
rendered
me
more
thoughtful
than
i
might
have
proven
under
ordinary
conditions
yet
it
is
to
be
frankly
confessed
by
one
desirous
of
writing
merely
the
truth
that
i
generally
acted
more
upon
impulse
than
reason
as
i
stood
forth
in
the
sunlight
of
that
lonely
mountain
road
my
hands
securely
bound
behind
my
back
the
end
of
the
rope
held
by
one
of
my
captors
while
his
fellow
leaned
lazily
upon
his
gun
and
watched
us
i
thought
somewhat
deeply
over
the
situation
and
those
peculiar
circumstances
leading
up
to
it
under
other
conditions
i
might
have
felt
tempted
to
enter
into
conversation
with
my
guards
who
as
i
now
perceived
were
far
from
being
the
rough
banditti
i
had
at
first
imagined
judging
from
their
faces
and
language
they
were
intelligent
enough
young
fellows
such
as
i
had
often
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
federal
army
but
i
realized
they
could
aid
me
little
if
any
in
the
one
thing
i
most
desired
to
know
and
even
if
they
could
a
sense
of
delicacy
would
have
caused
me
to
hesitate
in
asking
those
personal
questions
that
burned
upon
my
lips
my
deep
and
abiding
respect
for
this
woman
whom
i
had
so
strangely
met
and
with
whom
i
had
attained
some
degree
of
intimacy
would
never
permit
of
my
discussing
her
even
indirectly
with
private
soldiers
behind
the
back
of
their
officer
every
sense
of
honor
revolted
at
such
a
thought
not
through
any
curiosity
of
mine
however
justified
by
the
depth
of
my
own
feeling
should
she
be
made
the
subject
of
idle
gossip
about
the
for
in
truth
at
this
time
unhappy
as
my
own
situation
undeniably
was
and
as
a
soldier
i
realized
all
its
dangers
i
gave
it
but
little
consideration
usually
quick
of
wit
fertile
in
expedients
ever
ready
to
take
advantage
of
each
opportunity
i
had
taken
stock
of
all
my
surroundings
yet
discovered
nowhere
the
slightest
opening
for
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
guard
as
well
as
the
thorough
manner
in
which
i
was
bound
rendered
any
such
attempt
the
merest
madness
realizing
this
with
the
fatalism
of
a
veteran
i
resigned
myself
in
all
patience
to
what
must
be
then
it
was
that
other
thoughts
came
surging
upon
me
in
a
series
of
interrogatories
which
no
knowledge
i
possessed
could
possibly
answer
who
was
this
proud
womanly
woman
who
called
herself
edith
brennan
she
had
been
at
some
pains
to
inform
me
that
she
was
married
yet
there
was
that
about
her
her
bearing
her
manner
which
i
could
not
in
the
least
reconcile
with
that
thought
her
extreme
youthfulness
made
me
feel
it
improbable
and
the
impression
remained
with
me
that
she
intended
to
make
some
explanation
of
her
words
when
the
coming
of
bungay
interrupted
us
how
they
might
be
explained
i
could
not
imagine
i
merely
struggled
against
accepting
what
i
longed
to
believe
untrue
and
this
man
this
federal
major
bearing
the
same
name
whom
she
called
frank
who
was
he
what
manner
of
relationship
existed
between
them
in
their
meeting
and
short
intercourse
i
had
noted
several
things
which
told
me
much
that
she
feared
respected
valued
him
and
that
he
was
not
only
swayed
by
but
intensely
jealous
of
any
rival
in
her
good
opinion
yet
their
unexpected
meeting
was
scarcely
that
of
husband
and
wife
was
he
the
one
she
sought
in
her
night
ride
from
one
federal
camp
to
another
if
so
was
he
brother
friend
or
husband
what
was
the
bond
of
union
existing
between
these
two
every
word
spoken
made
me
fear
the
last
must
be
the
true
solution
such
were
some
of
the
queries
i
silently
struggled
with
and
they
were
rendered
more
acute
by
that
deepening
interest
which
i
now
confessed
to
myself
i
was
feeling
toward
her
who
inspired
them
it
may
be
fashionable
nowadays
to
sneer
at
love
yet
certain
it
is
the
rare
personality
of
this
edith
brennan
had
reached
and
influenced
me
in
those
few
hours
we
had
been
thrown
together
as
that
of
no
other
woman
had
ever
done
possibly
this
was
so
because
the
long
years
in
camp
and
field
had
kept
me
isolated
from
all
cultured
and
refined
womanhood
this
may
indeed
have
caused
me
to
be
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
beauty
and
purity
of
this
one
i
know
not
i
am
content
to
give
facts
and
leave
philosophy
to
others
my
life
has
ever
been
one
of
action
of
intense
feeling
and
there
in
the
road
that
day
standing
bareheaded
in
the
sun
i
was
clearly
conscious
of
but
one
changeless
fact
that
i
loved
edith
brennan
with
every
throb
of
my
heart
and
that
there
was
enmity
bitter
and
unforgiving
between
me
and
the
man
within
who
bore
her
name
whatever
he
might
be
to
her
i
rejoiced
to
know
that
he
hated
me
with
all
the
unreasoning
hatred
of
jealousy
i
had
read
it
in
his
eyes
in
his
words
in
his
manner
and
the
memory
of
its
open
manifestation
caused
me
to
smile
as
i
hoped
for
an
hour
when
we
should
meet
alone
and
face
to
face
how
she
regarded
him
i
was
unable
as
yet
to
tell
but
his
love
for
her
was
plainly
apparent
in
every
glance
and
word
as
i
was
thus
thinking
half
in
despair
and
half
in
hope
the
two
came
out
from
the
house
together
and
it
pleased
me
to
note
how
immediately
her
eyes
sought
for
me
and
how
she
lifted
her
hand
to
shade
them
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
so
that
she
might
see
more
clearly
her
companion
appeared
to
ignore
my
presence
utterly
and
gazed
anxiously
up
and
down
the
road
as
though
searching
for
something
peters
he
asked
sharply
of
the
fellow
on
guard
where
are
sergeant
steele
and
the
rest
of
the
squad
the
soldier
addressed
saluted
in
a
manner
that
convinced
me
he
was
of
the
regular
service
they
are
resting
out
of
the
sun
in
that
clump
of
bushes
down
the
hill
brennan
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
very
well
he
said
take
your
prisoner
down
there
and
tell
the
sergeant
to
press
on
at
once
toward
the
lower
road
we
shall
follow
you
and
the
lady
will
ride
his
the
man
turned
and
with
peremptory
gesture
ordered
me
forward
as
i
drew
closer
to
where
the
two
waited
beside
the
open
door
i
lifted
my
head
proudly
determined
that
neither
should
perceive
how
deeply
i
felt
the
humiliation
of
my
position
as
i
thus
passed
them
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
shining
road
ahead
my
ears
caught
a
word
or
two
of
indignant
expostulation
from
her
lips
but
frank
it
is
positively
shameful
in
this
he
laughed
lightly
yet
his
answer
came
to
me
in
all
clearness
of
utterance
i
believed
he
wished
me
to
overhear
the
words
oh
it
will
only
prove
of
benefit
to
his
brains
if
by
rare
chance
he
possesses
i
glanced
aside
and
saw
her
turn
instantly
and
face
him
her
eyes
aflame
with
indignation
then
i
will
as
she
spoke
her
voice
fairly
trembling
with
intense
feeling
she
stepped
backward
out
of
sight
into
the
house
another
instant
and
she
reappeared
sweeping
past
him
without
so
much
as
a
word
and
bearing
in
her
hand
my
old
campaign
hat
came
directly
up
to
us
sentry
she
said
in
her
old
imperious
manner
i
desire
to
place
this
hat
on
the
head
of
your
the
fellow
glanced
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
at
the
seemingly
unconscious
officer
not
knowing
whether
it
were
better
to
permit
the
act
or
not
but
she
waited
for
no
permission
captain
wayne
she
said
her
voice
grown
kindly
in
a
moment
and
her
eyes
frankly
meeting
mine
you
will
pardon
such
liberty
i
am
sure
but
it
is
not
right
that
you
should
be
compelled
to
march
uncovered
in
this
she
placed
the
hat
in
position
asking
as
she
did
so
does
that
feel
comfortable
the
memory
of
your
thoughtfulness
i
replied
warmly
bowing
as
best
i
might
will
make
the
march
pleasant
no
matter
what
its
end
may
mean
to
her
eyes
darkened
with
sudden
emotion
do
not
deem
me
wholly
ungrateful
she
said
quickly
and
in
a
low
tone
the
conditions
are
such
that
i
am
utterly
helpless
now
to
aid
you
major
brennan
is
a
man
not
to
be
lightly
disobeyed
but
i
shall
tell
my
story
to
general
sheridan
so
soon
as
we
reach
his
i
would
have
spoken
again
but
at
this
moment
brennan
came
striding
toward
us
come
edith
he
cried
almost
roughly
this
foolishness
has
surely
gone
far
enough
peters
what
are
you
waiting
here
for
i
told
you
to
take
your
prisoner
down
the
a
few
moments
later
the
centre
of
a
little
squad
of
heavily
armed
men
i
was
tramping
along
the
rocky
pathway
and
when
once
i
attempted
to
glance
back
to
discover
if
the
others
followed
us
the
sergeant
advised
me
with
an
oath
to
keep
my
eyes
to
the
front
i
obeyed
him
it
was
a
most
tiresome
march
in
the
hot
sun
over
the
rough
mountain
roads
there
were
times
when
we
left
these
altogether
and
crept
along
trails
leading
through
the
dense
woods
and
among
the
rocks
i
learned
from
scraps
of
conversation
floating
about
me
as
we
struggled
onward
that
these
precautions
were
not
taken
out
of
any
fear
of
meeting
with
confederate
troops
whose
nearest
commands
were
supposed
to
be
considerably
to
the
westward
of
where
we
were
but
because
of
a
desire
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
conflict
with
those
armed
and
irresponsible
bands
that
ranged
at
will
between
the
lines
of
the
two
great
armies
already
they
had
become
sufficiently
strong
to
make
trouble
for
small
detachments
it
must
have
been
nearly
the
end
of
the
afternoon
we
had
certainly
traversed
several
miles
and
were
then
moving
almost
directly
south
upon
a
pike
the
name
of
which
i
never
knew
all
the
party
were
travelling
close
together
when
the
scout
who
throughout
the
day
had
been
kept
a
few
hundred
yards
in
advance
came
back
toward
us
on
a
run
his
hand
flung
up
in
an
urgent
warning
to
halt
what
is
it
steele
brennan
questioned
spurring
forward
to
meet
him
come
speak
up
man
a
squad
of
cavalry
has
just
swung
onto
the
pike
sir
from
the
dirt
road
that
leads
toward
the
white
briar
was
the
soldier
panting
reply
and
i
could
get
a
glimpse
through
the
trees
down
the
valley
and
there
a
heavy
infantry
column
just
behind
them
they
rebs
sir
or
i
do
know
rebs
with
an
incredulous
laugh
why
man
we
got
the
only
reb
here
who
is
east
of
the
well
returned
the
scout
sullenly
they
coming
from
the
west
and
i
know
they
ai
our
he
was
too
old
a
soldier
to
have
his
judgment
doubted
and
he
was
evidently
convinced
brennan
glanced
quickly
about
however
he
may
have
sneered
at
the
report
he
was
not
rash
enough
to
chance
so
grave
a
mistake
get
back
into
those
rocks
there
on
the
right
he
commanded
sharply
hustle
your
prisoner
along
lively
men
and
one
of
you
stand
over
him
with
a
cocked
gun
if
he
so
much
as
opens
his
mouth
let
him
have
rapidly
as
we
moved
we
were
scarcely
all
under
cover
before
the
advance
cavalry
guard
came
in
sight
the
light
fringe
of
troopers
and
weary
resting
heavily
in
their
saddles
and
apparently
thoughtless
as
to
any
possibility
of
meeting
with
the
enemy
there
were
not
more
than
a
troop
of
them
all
told
yet
their
short
gray
jackets
and
light
hats
instantly
told
the
story
of
their
service
their
rear
rank
was
yet
in
sight
when
we
heard
the
heavy
tread
of
the
approaching
column
together
with
the
dull
tinkle
of
steel
which
always
accompanies
marching
troops
peering
forth
as
much
as
i
dared
from
behind
the
thick
brush
where
i
had
been
roughly
thrown
face
downward
i
saw
the
head
of
that
solid
sturdy
column
swing
around
the
sharp
bend
in
the
road
and
in
double
front
spreading
from
rock
to
rock
come
sweeping
down
toward
us
the
command
was
moving
forward
rapidly
at
the
rout
step
that
long
easy
swinging
stride
so
peculiar
to
the
southern
infantry
with
the
merest
semblance
of
order
in
formation
which
is
the
inevitable
result
of
hard
rapid
marching
every
movement
bespoke
them
veteran
troops
they
were
covered
with
dust
their
faces
fairly
caked
with
it
their
uniforms
almost
indistinguishable
their
drums
silent
their
colors
cased
their
hats
pulled
low
over
their
eyes
their
guns
held
in
any
position
most
convenient
for
carrying
and
with
stern
wearied
faces
set
doggedly
upon
the
road
in
their
front
no
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
was
here
but
these
were
fighting
men
never
before
save
as
i
watched
pickett
charging
line
sweep
on
to
death
at
gettysburg
did
i
feel
the
stern
manliness
of
war
as
now
file
upon
file
company
after
company
regiment
following
regiment
they
swung
sternly
by
scarcely
so
much
as
a
word
reached
us
excepting
now
and
then
some
briefly
muttered
command
to
close
up
or
a
curse
as
a
shuffling
foot
stumbled
i
could
distinguish
no
badge
no
insignia
of
either
corps
or
division
the
circling
dust
enveloped
them
in
a
choking
disfiguring
cloud
but
they
were
confederates
i
marked
them
well
here
and
there
along
the
toiling
ranks
i
even
noted
a
familiar
face
and
there
could
be
no
mistaking
the
gaunt
north
carolina
mountaineer
the
sallow
georgian
or
the
jaunty
louisiana
creole
they
were
confederates
packer
division
of
hill
corps
i
could
have
almost
sworn
on
forced
march
and
i
doubted
not
that
each
to
left
and
right
of
us
would
likewise
show
its
hurrying
gray
column
sturdily
pressing
forward
the
veteran
fighting
men
of
the
left
wing
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
were
boldly
pushing
eastward
to
keep
their
tryst
with
lee
the
despatch
intrusted
to
my
care
had
been
borne
safely
to
longstreet
the
keen
joy
of
it
lighted
up
my
face
and
brennan
turning
toward
me
as
the
last
limping
straggler
disappeared
over
the
ridge
saw
it
and
grew
white
with
anger
you
rebel
cur
he
cried
fiercely
in
his
sudden
outburst
of
passion
what
does
all
this
mean
where
is
that
division
bound
some
change
in
longstreet
front
i
should
judge
i
answered
coolly
too
happy
even
to
note
his
slur
you
know
better
he
retorted
hotly
the
way
those
fellows
march
tells
plainly
enough
that
they
have
covered
all
of
fifteen
miles
since
daybreak
it
is
a
general
movement
and
by
heaven
you
shall
answer
sheridan
even
if
you
wo
chapter
xi
in
the
presence
of
sheridan
it
had
been
dark
for
nearly
an
hour
before
we
entered
what
was
from
all
appearances
a
large
and
populous
camp
hurried
forward
constantly
closely
surrounded
by
my
guard
i
was
enabled
to
gain
but
an
inadequate
conception
of
either
its
situation
or
extent
yet
the
distance
traversed
by
our
party
after
passing
the
outer
sentries
and
before
we
made
final
halt
taken
in
connection
with
evidence
on
every
side
of
the
presence
in
considerable
numbers
of
all
the
varied
branches
of
the
service
convinced
me
we
were
within
no
mere
brigade
encampment
but
had
doubtless
arrived
at
the
main
headquarters
of
this
department
although
i
noted
all
this
in
a
vague
way
so
as
to
recall
it
afterwards
yet
i
was
too
thoroughly
fatigued
to
care
where
i
was
or
what
became
of
me
hardened
as
i
had
grown
through
experience
to
exposure
and
weariness
the
continuous
strain
undergone
since
i
had
ridden
westward
from
general
lee
tent
had
completely
unnerved
me
no
sooner
was
i
thrust
into
the
unknown
darkness
of
a
hut
by
the
not
unkindly
sergeant
than
i
threw
myself
prone
on
the
floor
and
was
sound
asleep
before
the
door
had
fairly
closed
behind
him
my
rest
was
not
destined
to
be
a
long
one
it
seemed
i
had
barely
closed
my
eyes
when
a
rough
hand
shook
me
again
into
consciousness
the
flaming
glare
of
an
uplifted
flung
its
radiance
over
figures
grouped
in
the
open
doorway
a
corporal
with
a
white
chin
beard
was
bending
over
me
come
johnny
he
said
tersely
get
up
you
the
instinct
of
soldierly
obedience
in
which
i
had
been
so
long
trained
caused
me
to
grope
my
way
to
my
feet
what
time
is
it
corporal
i
asked
sleepily
after
who
wishes
me
headquarters
he
returned
brusquely
come
move
on
fall
in
a
moment
later
we
were
off
passing
between
long
lines
of
dying
fires
tramping
rapidly
along
a
rough
road
which
seemed
to
incline
sharply
upward
our
single
torch
throwing
grotesque
shadows
on
either
side
the
swift
movement
and
the
crisp
night
air
swept
the
vestiges
of
slumber
from
my
brain
and
i
began
instinctively
to
gather
together
my
scattered
wits
for
whatever
new
experience
confronted
me
our
march
was
a
short
one
and
we
soon
turned
abruptly
in
at
a
gateway
high
pillars
of
brick
stood
upon
either
hand
and
the
passage
was
well
lighted
by
a
brightly
blazing
fire
of
logs
two
sentries
stood
there
and
our
party
passed
between
them
without
uttering
a
word
as
we
moved
beyond
the
radiance
i
noted
a
little
knot
of
cavalrymen
silently
sitting
their
horses
in
the
shadow
of
the
high
wall
a
wide
gravelled
walk
bordered
i
thought
with
flowers
led
toward
the
front
door
of
a
commodious
house
built
after
the
colonial
type
the
lower
story
seemed
fairly
ablaze
with
lights
and
at
the
head
of
the
steps
as
we
ascended
a
young
officer
came
quickly
forward
is
this
the
prisoner
brought
in
the
corporal
pushed
me
forward
this
is
the
man
very
well
hold
your
command
here
until
i
send
other
he
rested
one
hand
not
unkindly
upon
my
arm
and
his
tone
instantly
changed
from
that
of
command
to
generous
courtesy
you
will
accompany
me
and
permit
me
to
advise
you
for
your
own
sake
to
be
as
civil
as
possible
in
your
answers
for
the
is
in
one
of
his
we
crossed
the
rather
dimly
lighted
hall
which
had
a
sentry
posted
at
either
end
of
it
and
then
my
conductor
threw
open
a
side
door
and
silently
motioned
for
me
to
enter
in
advance
of
him
it
was
a
spacious
room
elegant
in
all
its
appointments
but
my
hasty
glance
revealed
only
three
occupants
sitting
at
a
handsomely
polished
mahogany
near
the
centre
of
the
apartment
was
a
short
stoutly
built
man
with
straggly
beard
and
fierce
stern
eyes
i
recognized
him
at
once
although
he
wore
neither
uniform
nor
other
insignia
of
rank
close
beside
him
stood
a
colonel
of
engineers
possibly
his
chief
of
staff
while
to
the
right
leaning
negligently
with
one
arm
on
the
above
the
fireplace
and
smiling
insolently
at
me
was
brennan
the
sight
of
him
stiffened
me
like
a
drink
of
brandy
and
as
the
young
aide
closed
the
door
in
my
rear
i
stepped
instantly
forward
to
the
table
facing
him
who
i
knew
must
be
in
command
and
removing
my
hat
saluted
this
is
the
prisoner
you
sent
for
sir
announced
the
aide
the
officer
who
remained
seated
looked
at
me
intently
have
i
ever
met
you
before
he
questioned
as
though
doubting
his
memory
you
have
general
sheridan
i
replied
i
was
with
general
early
during
your
conference
at
white
horse
tavern
i
also
bore
a
flag
to
you
after
the
cavalry
skirmish
at
wilson
i
remember
shortly
and
as
he
spoke
he
wheeled
in
his
chair
to
face
brennan
i
thought
you
reported
this
officer
as
a
spy
he
said
sternly
he
is
in
uniform
and
doubtless
told
you
his
name
and
i
certainly
had
every
reason
to
believe
he
penetrated
our
lines
in
disguise
was
the
instant
reply
this
cavalry
cloak
was
found
with
him
and
consequently
i
naturally
supposed
his
claim
of
rank
to
be
sheridan
looked
annoyed
yet
turned
back
to
me
without
administering
the
sharp
rebuke
which
seemed
burning
upon
his
lips
were
you
wearing
that
cavalry
cloak
within
our
lines
he
questioned
sternly
i
was
not
sir
it
was
indeed
lying
upon
the
floor
of
the
hut
when
major
brennan
entered
but
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
he
gazed
at
me
searchingly
for
a
moment
in
silence
i
regret
we
have
treated
you
with
so
little
consideration
he
said
apologetically
but
you
were
supposed
to
be
merely
a
spy
may
i
ask
your
name
and
rank
captain
wayne
th
virginia
why
were
you
within
our
lines
i
was
passing
through
them
with
for
whom
you
certainly
realize
that
i
must
decline
to
major
brennan
he
asked
turning
aside
again
was
this
officer
searched
by
your
party
he
was
sir
but
no
papers
were
found
he
stated
to
me
later
that
his
despatch
was
had
it
been
delivered
i
so
understood
well
how
did
he
account
to
you
for
being
where
he
was
found
brennan
hesitated
and
glanced
uneasily
toward
me
like
a
flash
the
thought
came
that
the
man
was
striving
to
keep
her
name
entirely
out
of
sight
he
did
not
wish
her
presence
mentioned
there
was
no
explanation
attempted
he
said
finally
he
seemed
simply
to
be
hiding
alone
again
i
caught
his
eyes
and
it
almost
seemed
that
i
read
entreaty
in
them
excepting
the
wife
of
the
mountaineer
he
answered
hoarsely
is
this
true
asked
sheridan
his
stern
face
fronting
me
i
made
my
decision
instantly
there
might
be
some
reason
possibly
her
own
request
whereby
her
being
alone
with
me
that
night
should
remain
untold
very
well
it
would
never
be
borne
to
other
ears
through
any
failure
of
my
lips
to
guard
the
secret
she
had
voluntarily
pledged
herself
to
go
to
sheridan
in
my
defence
until
she
did
so
her
secret
if
secret
indeed
it
was
should
remain
safe
with
me
i
could
do
no
less
in
honor
it
is
not
altogether
true
i
said
firmly
and
no
one
knows
this
better
than
major
brennan
i
was
there
as
i
told
him
wholly
because
of
an
accident
upon
the
road
but
as
to
its
particulars
i
must
most
respectfully
decline
to
you
realize
what
such
a
refusal
may
mean
to
you
i
understand
fully
the
construction
which
may
unjustly
be
placed
upon
it
by
those
who
desire
to
condemn
me
but
at
present
i
can
make
no
more
definite
reply
i
have
reason
to
believe
the
full
facts
will
be
presented
to
you
by
one
in
whose
word
you
will
have
i
caught
a
gleam
of
positive
delight
in
brennan
eyes
and
instantly
wondered
if
this
seeming
reluctance
upon
his
part
was
not
merely
a
clever
mode
of
tricking
me
into
silence
into
what
might
seem
an
insolent
contempt
of
federal
authority
i
would
wait
and
see
there
would
surely
be
ample
time
for
her
to
act
if
she
desired
to
do
so
anyway
i
was
little
disposed
to
find
shelter
behind
a
woman
skirts
sheridan
straightened
in
his
chair
and
looked
across
the
table
at
me
almost
angrily
very
well
sir
he
said
gravely
your
fate
is
in
your
own
hands
and
will
depend
very
largely
upon
your
replies
to
my
questions
you
claim
to
have
been
the
bearer
of
despatches
and
hence
no
spy
yet
you
possess
nothing
to
substantiate
your
claim
as
your
regiment
is
with
lee
i
presume
you
were
seeking
longstreet
were
your
despatches
delivered
i
have
reason
to
believe
by
yourself
by
the
sergeant
who
accompanied
me
and
who
continued
the
journey
after
i
was
is
lee
contemplating
an
immediate
movement
general
sheridan
i
exclaimed
indignantly
you
must
surely
forget
that
i
am
an
officer
of
the
confederate
army
you
certainly
have
no
reason
to
expect
that
i
will
so
far
disregard
my
obvious
duty
as
to
answer
such
a
your
refusal
to
explain
why
you
were
hiding
within
our
lines
is
ample
reason
for
my
insistence
he
said
tartly
and
i
am
not
accustomed
to
treating
spies
with
any
great
consideration
even
when
they
claim
rebel
commissions
you
are
not
the
first
to
seek
escape
in
that
way
was
your
despatch
the
cause
of
the
hurried
departure
of
longstreet
troops
eastward
this
last
question
was
hurled
directly
at
me
and
i
noticed
that
every
eye
in
the
room
was
eagerly
scanning
my
face
i
had
the
quick
fiery
temper
of
a
boy
then
and
my
cheeks
flushed
i
positively
decline
to
answer
one
word
relative
to
the
despatches
intrusted
to
me
i
said
deliberately
and
my
voice
shook
with
sudden
rush
of
anger
and
no
officer
who
did
not
dishonor
the
uniform
he
wore
would
insult
me
with
the
a
bombshell
exploding
in
the
room
could
not
have
astonished
them
as
did
my
answer
i
realized
to
the
full
the
probable
result
but
my
spirit
was
high
and
i
felt
the
utter
uselessness
of
prolonging
the
interview
sooner
or
later
the
same
end
must
come
sheridan
face
naturally
flushed
instantly
grew
crimson
and
a
dangerous
light
flamed
into
his
fierce
eyes
for
a
moment
he
seemed
unable
to
speak
then
he
thundered
forth
you
young
fool
i
can
tell
you
that
you
will
speak
before
another
hours
or
i
hang
you
for
a
spy
if
it
cost
me
my
command
major
brennan
take
this
young
popinjay
to
the
mansion
house
under
brennan
stepped
forward
smiling
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
part
assigned
to
him
come
on
you
johnny
he
said
coarsely
his
hand
closing
heavily
on
my
arm
then
seeming
unable
to
repress
his
pleasure
at
the
ending
of
the
interview
and
his
present
sense
of
power
he
bent
lower
so
that
his
insolent
words
should
not
reach
the
others
and
hissed
hotly
stealing
women
is
probably
more
in
your
line
than
at
the
sneering
words
and
the
insulting
look
which
accompanied
them
my
blood
already
boiling
leaped
into
sudden
fire
all
the
fierce
hatred
engendered
within
me
by
his
past
treatment
his
cowardly
insinuations
his
unknown
yet
intimate
relationship
to
the
woman
i
loved
flamed
up
in
irresistible
power
and
i
struck
him
with
my
open
hand
across
the
lips
you
miserable
hound
i
cried
madly
none
but
a
coward
would
taunt
a
helpless
prisoner
i
only
hope
i
may
yet
be
free
long
enough
to
write
the
lie
with
steel
across
your
before
he
could
move
sheridan
was
upon
his
feet
and
between
us
back
both
of
you
he
ordered
sharply
there
shall
be
no
brawling
here
major
brennan
you
will
remain
i
would
speak
with
you
further
regarding
this
matter
lieutenant
caton
take
charge
of
the
chapter
xii
under
sentence
of
death
at
this
late
date
i
doubt
greatly
if
my
situation
at
that
time
was
so
desperate
as
i
then
conceived
it
i
question
now
whether
the
death
sentence
would
ever
have
been
executed
but
then
with
the
memory
of
sheridan
rage
and
my
own
retort
i
fully
believed
my
fate
was
destined
to
be
that
of
the
condemned
spy
unless
she
who
alone
might
tell
the
whole
truth
should
voluntarily
do
so
that
circumstances
had
left
me
in
the
power
of
one
whose
fierce
dislike
was
already
evident
was
beyond
question
and
i
had
yielded
to
his
goading
to
such
an
extent
as
to
give
those
in
authority
every
excuse
for
the
exercise
of
extreme
military
power
yet
of
one
thing
i
was
firmly
resolved
no
thoughtless
word
of
mine
should
ever
endanger
the
reputation
of
edith
brennan
right
or
wrong
i
would
go
to
a
death
of
dishonor
before
i
would
speak
without
her
authority
love
and
pride
conspired
to
make
this
decision
adamant
there
might
indeed
be
no
reason
why
i
should
not
speak
with
utmost
freedom
but
as
to
this
i
could
not
judge
and
therefore
preferred
the
safer
side
of
silence
the
action
of
brennan
had
impressed
this
upon
me
as
a
duty
had
caused
me
to
feel
that
i
could
best
serve
her
by
blotting
out
the
adventures
of
the
night
before
seemingly
it
was
her
own
desire
and
as
a
gentleman
an
officer
a
man
of
honor
i
might
not
even
question
that
decree
deeply
as
these
considerations
would
have
affected
me
under
ordinary
conditions
one
doubt
now
overshadowed
them
all
was
the
man
i
struck
the
husband
of
the
woman
i
loved
this
was
what
i
desired
to
know
even
above
my
own
fate
i
scarcely
doubted
yet
would
not
yield
the
slight
hope
i
retained
that
it
might
prove
otherwise
a
trick
of
chance
speech
seemed
to
solve
the
problem
to
answer
that
question
which
i
durst
not
ask
directly
come
said
caton
briefly
and
i
turned
and
accompanied
him
without
thought
of
resistance
at
the
front
door
he
ordered
the
little
squad
of
waiting
soldiers
to
fall
in
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
led
the
way
down
the
gravelled
path
to
the
road
i
was
impressed
by
his
seeming
carelessness
but
as
we
cleared
the
gateway
he
spoke
and
his
words
helped
me
to
comprehend
captain
wayne
he
said
quietly
so
that
the
words
could
not
be
overheard
you
do
not
recognize
me
but
i
was
the
officer
who
conducted
you
to
headquarters
when
you
brought
the
flag
in
at
wilson
creek
of
course
i
must
perform
the
duty
given
me
but
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
wholly
believe
your
he
stopped
extended
his
hand
and
i
accepted
it
silently
there
must
surely
be
some
grave
personal
reason
which
seals
your
lips
he
questioned
there
i
thought
as
much
i
chanced
to
overhear
the
words
or
rather
a
portion
of
them
which
brennan
whispered
and
have
no
doubt
if
they
were
explained
to
the
general
he
would
feel
more
kindly
disposed
toward
it
was
asked
as
a
question
and
i
felt
obliged
to
reply
i
appreciate
deeply
your
desire
to
aid
me
but
there
are
circumstances
involving
others
which
compel
me
for
the
present
to
silence
indeed
my
possible
fate
does
not
so
greatly
trouble
me
only
that
i
possess
a
strong
desire
to
have
freedom
long
enough
to
cross
swords
with
this
major
of
yours
the
quarrel
between
us
has
become
bitterly
personal
and
i
hunger
for
a
chance
to
have
it
out
do
you
know
is
he
a
man
who
would
fight
the
young
fellow
stiffened
slightly
we
are
serving
upon
the
same
staff
he
said
more
abruptly
and
while
we
have
never
been
close
friends
yet
i
can
not
honorably
take
sides
against
him
he
has
been
out
twice
within
the
last
three
years
to
my
knowledge
and
is
not
devoid
either
of
courage
or
skill
possibly
however
the
arrival
of
his
wife
may
make
him
less
a
his
wife
i
stopped
so
suddenly
that
he
involuntarily
tightened
his
grip
upon
my
arm
as
though
suspicious
of
an
attempt
to
escape
do
you
i
asked
gaining
some
slight
control
over
myself
refer
to
the
lady
who
came
in
with
his
party
last
evening
most
certainly
she
was
presented
to
all
of
us
as
brennan
she
has
been
assigned
rooms
at
his
quarters
and
she
wears
a
far
too
fine
a
woman
in
my
judgment
for
such
a
master
but
then
that
is
not
so
uncommon
a
mistake
in
marriage
why
come
to
think
about
it
you
must
have
met
her
yourself
have
you
reason
to
suspect
this
is
not
their
relationship
not
in
the
least
i
hastened
to
answer
fearful
lest
my
thoughtless
exclamation
might
become
the
basis
for
camp
gossip
indeed
i
was
scarcely
in
the
lady
presence
at
all
coming
in
as
i
was
left
in
charge
of
the
he
looked
at
me
keenly
through
the
darkness
it
seems
somewhat
curious
to
me
that
such
deep
enmity
has
grown
up
between
you
two
in
so
short
a
time
one
almost
suspects
as
in
most
cases
there
may
be
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
i
laughed
carelessly
not
in
the
least
my
friend
but
there
are
indignities
a
captor
can
show
to
his
prisoner
which
no
true
gentleman
would
ever
be
guilty
of
and
no
soldier
would
i
could
see
in
the
his
face
flush
with
sudden
indignation
you
are
right
he
returned
heartily
and
from
my
knowledge
of
brennan
i
can
understand
your
meaning
what
business
has
such
a
man
to
possess
a
wife
perhaps
he
felt
that
he
had
already
said
too
much
for
we
tramped
on
in
silence
until
we
drew
near
a
large
square
white
building
standing
directly
beside
the
road
this
is
the
old
culverton
tavern
known
as
the
mansion
house
he
said
it
is
a
tremendous
big
building
for
this
country
with
as
fine
a
ballroom
in
it
as
i
have
seen
since
leaving
new
york
we
utilize
it
for
almost
every
military
purpose
and
among
others
some
of
the
strong
rooms
in
the
basement
are
found
valuable
for
the
of
important
we
mounted
the
front
steps
as
he
was
speaking
passing
through
a
cordon
of
guards
and
in
the
wide
hallway
i
was
turned
over
to
the
officer
in
charge
captain
said
caton
kindly
extending
his
hand
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
shall
say
all
i
can
in
your
favor
but
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
brennan
has
great
influence
just
now
at
headquarters
and
sheridan
is
not
a
man
to
lightly
overlook
those
hasty
words
you
spoke
to
i
could
only
thank
him
most
warmly
for
his
interest
realizing
fully
from
his
grave
manner
my
desperate
situation
and
follow
my
silent
conductor
down
some
narrow
and
steep
stairs
until
we
stood
upon
the
cemented
floor
of
the
basement
here
a
heavy
door
in
the
stone
division
wall
was
opened
i
was
pushed
forward
into
the
dense
darkness
within
and
the
lock
clicked
dully
behind
me
so
thick
was
the
wall
i
could
not
even
distinguish
the
retreating
steps
of
the
jailer
tired
as
i
was
from
the
intense
strain
of
the
past
hours
even
my
anxious
thoughts
were
insufficient
to
keep
me
awake
feeling
my
way
cautiously
along
the
wall
i
came
at
last
to
a
wide
wooden
bench
and
stretching
my
form
at
full
length
upon
it
pillowed
my
head
on
one
arm
and
almost
instantly
was
sound
asleep
when
i
awoke
sore
from
my
hard
bed
and
stiffened
by
the
uncomfortable
position
in
which
i
lay
it
was
broad
daylight
that
the
morning
was
indeed
well
advanced
i
knew
from
the
single
ray
of
sunlight
which
streamed
in
through
a
grated
window
high
up
in
the
wall
opposite
me
and
fell
like
a
bar
of
gold
across
the
rough
stone
floor
i
was
alone
even
in
the
dark
of
the
previous
night
i
had
discovered
the
sole
pretence
to
furniture
in
the
place
the
room
itself
proved
to
be
a
large
and
almost
square
apartment
probably
during
the
ordinary
occupancy
of
the
house
a
receptacle
for
wood
or
garden
produce
but
now
peculiarly
well
adapted
to
the
safeguarding
of
prisoners
the
solid
stone
walls
were
of
sufficient
height
to
afford
no
chance
of
reaching
the
great
oak
girders
that
supported
the
floor
above
even
had
the
doing
so
offered
a
favorable
opening
for
escape
there
were
apparently
but
three
openings
of
any
kind
the
outside
window
through
which
the
sunlight
streamed
protected
by
thick
bars
of
iron
a
second
opening
quite
narrow
and
likewise
protected
by
a
heavy
metal
grating
and
the
tightly
locked
door
by
means
of
which
i
had
entered
the
second
i
concluded
after
inspecting
it
closely
was
a
mere
air
passage
leading
into
some
other
division
of
the
cellar
i
noted
these
openings
idly
and
with
scarcely
a
thought
as
to
the
possibility
of
escape
i
had
awakened
with
strange
indifference
as
to
what
my
fate
might
be
such
a
feeling
was
not
natural
to
me
but
the
fierce
emotions
of
the
preceding
night
had
seemingly
robbed
me
of
all
my
usual
buoyancy
of
hope
in
one
sense
i
yet
trusted
that
brennan
would
keep
her
pledge
and
tell
her
story
to
sheridan
if
she
failed
to
do
this
and
left
me
to
face
the
rifles
or
the
rope
then
it
made
but
small
odds
how
soon
it
should
be
over
if
she
cared
for
me
in
the
slightest
degree
she
would
not
let
me
die
unjustly
and
to
my
mind
then
she
had
become
the
centre
of
all
life
despondency
is
largely
a
matter
of
physical
condition
and
i
was
still
sufficiently
fagged
to
be
in
the
depths
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
an
ordinary
army
ration
was
placed
within
the
soldier
who
brought
it
did
not
speak
nor
did
i
attempt
to
address
him
but
after
he
retired
the
appetizing
smell
of
the
bacon
together
with
the
unmistakable
flavor
of
real
coffee
drew
me
irrresistibly
that
way
and
i
made
a
hearty
meal
the
food
put
new
life
into
me
and
i
fell
to
pacing
back
and
forth
between
the
corners
of
the
cell
my
mind
full
of
questioning
yet
with
a
fresh
measure
of
confidence
that
all
would
still
be
well
i
was
yet
at
it
when
without
warning
the
door
once
again
opened
and
lieutenant
caton
entered
he
advanced
toward
me
with
outstretched
hand
which
i
grasped
warmly
for
i
felt
how
much
depended
on
his
friendship
and
resolved
to
ask
him
some
questions
which
should
solve
my
last
remaining
doubts
captain
wayne
he
began
soberly
looking
about
him
you
are
in
even
worse
stress
here
than
i
had
supposed
but
i
shall
see
to
it
that
you
are
furnished
with
blankets
before
i
you
have
nothing
new
then
to
communicate
regarding
the
possibility
of
release
i
asked
anxiously
alas
no
brennan
appears
to
hate
you
with
all
the
animosity
of
his
strange
nature
and
his
influence
is
so
much
stronger
than
mine
that
i
have
almost
been
commanded
not
to
mention
your
name
but
surely
i
urged
i
am
to
receive
the
ordinary
privilege
of
a
prisoner
of
war
general
sheridan
will
not
condemn
me
without
evidence
or
trial
merely
because
in
a
moment
of
sudden
anger
i
used
hasty
words
which
i
have
ever
since
regretted
caton
shook
his
head
my
dear
fellow
it
is
not
that
sheridan
is
hasty
himself
and
his
temper
often
leads
him
to
rash
language
no
i
am
sure
he
bears
you
no
malice
for
what
you
said
but
brennan
has
his
ear
and
has
whispered
something
to
him
in
confidence
what
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
which
has
convinced
him
that
you
are
deserving
of
death
under
martial
without
trial
the
opportunity
of
furnishing
the
information
desired
will
be
again
offered
you
but
as
near
as
i
can
learn
the
charge
preferred
against
you
is
of
such
a
private
nature
that
it
is
deemed
best
not
to
make
it
matter
for
camp
talk
whatever
it
may
be
sheridan
evidently
feels
justified
in
taking
the
case
out
from
the
usual
channels
and
in
using
most
drastic
measures
i
am
sorry
to
bring
you
such
news
especially
as
i
believe
the
charges
are
largely
concocted
in
the
brain
of
him
who
makes
them
and
have
but
the
thinnest
circumstantial
evidence
to
sustain
them
yet
sheridan
is
thoroughly
convinced
and
will
brook
no
interference
the
discussion
of
the
case
has
already
led
to
his
using
extremely
harsh
words
to
his
chief
of
i
am
to
be
shot
then
his
hand
closed
warmly
over
mine
while
there
is
life
there
is
always
hope
he
answered
surely
it
must
be
in
your
power
to
prove
the
nature
of
your
mission
within
our
lines
and
the
delay
thus
gained
will
enable
us
to
learn
and
meet
these
more
serious
if
i
but
had
time
to
communicate
with
general
but
now
is
there
no
one
no
way
by
which
such
representation
can
be
given
this
very
day
if
not
full
proof
of
your
innocence
then
sufficient
at
least
to
cause
the
necessary
delay
i
shook
my
head
i
know
of
nothing
other
than
my
own
unsupported
word
i
answered
shortly
and
that
is
evidently
of
no
value
as
against
major
brennan
secret
insinuations
when
is
the
hour
set
i
am
not
positive
that
final
decision
has
yet
been
reached
but
i
heard
daybreak
mentioned
the
probability
of
an
early
movement
of
our
troops
is
the
excuse
urged
for
such
unseemly
i
remained
silent
for
a
moment
conscious
only
of
his
kindly
eyes
reading
my
face
mrs
brennan
i
asked
finally
recurring
to
the
one
thought
in
which
i
retained
deep
interest
does
she
still
remain
in
the
camp
she
was
with
the
major
at
headquarters
this
morning
i
believe
they
breakfasted
with
the
general
but
i
was
on
duty
so
late
last
night
that
i
overslept
and
thus
missed
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
we
talked
for
some
time
longer
and
he
continued
to
urge
me
for
some
further
word
but
i
could
give
him
none
and
finally
the
kindly
fellow
departed
promising
to
see
me
again
within
a
few
hours
greatly
as
i
now
valued
his
friendship
it
was
nevertheless
a
relief
to
be
alone
with
my
thoughts
once
more
chapter
xiii
a
strange
way
out
caton
came
in
once
more
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
bringing
me
some
blankets
but
he
had
no
news
and
his
boyish
face
was
a
picture
of
pathos
as
he
wrung
my
hand
sheridan
he
said
had
gone
down
the
lines
and
both
brennan
and
himself
were
under
orders
to
follow
in
another
hour
what
instructions
if
any
had
been
left
regarding
my
case
he
could
not
say
but
he
feared
the
worst
from
the
unusual
secrecy
sheridan
expected
to
return
to
his
headquarters
that
same
evening
as
the
officers
of
his
staff
were
to
give
a
grand
ball
i
felt
no
inclination
to
partake
of
the
rude
supper
left
me
and
just
before
dark
i
was
lying
upon
the
bench
idly
wondering
if
that
was
to
prove
the
last
vestige
of
daylight
i
should
ever
behold
in
this
world
when
without
slightest
warning
the
heavy
iron
grating
in
the
wall
directly
above
me
fell
suddenly
striking
the
edge
of
the
bench
and
clattered
noisily
to
the
floor
the
fall
was
so
unexpected
and
my
escape
from
injury
so
narrow
that
i
lay
almost
stunned
staring
up
helplessly
at
the
dark
hole
thus
left
bare
as
i
gazed
a
face
framed
itself
in
this
narrow
opening
and
two
wary
eyes
peered
cautiously
down
at
me
there
was
no
mistaking
that
countenance
even
in
the
fast
waning
light
and
i
instantly
sat
up
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
jed
bungay
as
i
live
the
puzzled
face
broke
into
a
grin
of
delight
holy
smoke
cap
he
ejaculated
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
thet
you
suah
i
wus
so
durned
skeered
i
made
a
mess
o
it
whin
thet
thar
iron
drapped
thet
i
near
died
crossed
the
threshold
and
a
clang
of
angry
steel
that
instant
rang
he
peered
around
cautiously
screwing
up
his
little
eyes
as
though
transforming
them
into
miniature
telescopes
thou
wouldst
view
fair
melrose
aright
go
visit
it
by
the
pale
moonlight
be
ye
all
alone
cap
with
the
exception
of
a
few
rats
whut

they
a
goin
ter
dew
with
ye
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
it
is
their
purpose
to
shoot
me
at
daybreak
shoot
hell
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
had
just
heard
his
own
death
sentence
pronounced
and
his
little
peaked
face
looked
ghastly
in
the
dim
light
shoot

good
lord

that

to
charge
me
with
being
a
spy
and
as
i
was
foolish
enough
to
insult
general
sheridan
last
night
my
fate
is
probably
this
somewhat
complex
statement
seemed
to
be
too
much
for
jed
to
grasp
promptly
gosh

do
say
he
muttered
then
durn
it

in

i
rose
to
my
feet
slowly
wondering
at
the
strange
lassitude
which
made
me
so
indifferent
to
that
life
i
had
always
before
so
highly
valued

noticed
my
hopelessness

these
words
brought
back
to
me
in
an
instantaneous
flash
the
old
dominant
military
spirit
for
lee
yes
for
lee
i
would
yet
take
chances
undergo
fatigue
brave
death
if
life
must
be
given
up
let
it
be
yielded
gallantly
in
the
open
and
on

of

distant
comrades

exclaimed
staring
eagerly

the
now
darkened

but
how
do
you

i
questioned
incredulously
as
the
whole
scene
and
its
dread
possibilities
unrolled
before
my
mental
vision
ther
nigger
i
held
up
hed
a
despatch

then

replied
promptly
oh

as
how
maybe
lee

hangs
on
one
of

gittin
out

where
was
roderick
then
one
blast
upon
his
bugle
horn
were
worth
a
thousand
men
that
he
meant
every
word
he
spoke
i
felt
convinced
and
his
enthusiasm
was
contagious
my
blood
leaped
within
me
at
this
call
to
action
all
lethargy
fled
and
with
it
every
deadening
thought
of
her
who
had
so
suddenly
woven
about
me
the
meshes
of
her
power
false
or
true
maid
wife
or
widow
my
duty
as
a
soldier
to
my
commander
and
the
army
to
which
i
belonged
blotted
out
all
else
even
as
this
new
rush
of
determination
swept
over
me
above
us
there
sounded
clearly
the
dashing
music
of
a
military
band
in
the
strains
of
a
strauss
waltz
and
we
could
distinguish
the
muffled
shuffling
of
many
feet
on
the
oaken
floor
overhead
caton
chance
remark
about
the
great
ball
to
be
given
that
evening
by
officers
of
the
headquarters
staff
recurred
to
my
memory
that
dancing
up
there
will
help
us
jed
i
said
quickly
my
mind
now
active
to
grasp
every
detail
you
say
there
is
a
chance
for
escape
from
your
cell
then
give
me
your
hand
and
help
me
to
crawl
through
that
it
was
a
narrow
squeeze
for
a
man
of
my
size
yet
i
crept
through
without
great
difficulty
and
found
myself
in
the
dense
darkness
of
a
room
which
as
i
judged
hastily
from
feeling
about
me
was
similar
in
shape
and
extent
to
the
one
in
which
i
had
been
confined
bungay
however
permitted
me
little
time
for
exploration
grasping
me
firmly
by
one
arm
and
feeling
his
way
along
the
wall
he
groped
across
to
the
other
side
there
a
mighty
big
stone
chimbly
comes
down
yere
cap
he
whispered
his
lips
close
to
my
ears
although
the
noise
above
made
conversation
in
an
ordinary
tone
perfectly
safe
an
ther
openin
ter
take
out
soot
an
ashes
is
up
thar
jist
ther
fluer
it
a
pan
i
reckon
ther
way
it
feels
an
it
must
be
thar
they
put
a
nigger
in
ter
clean
ther
chimbly
whin
it
gits
stuffed
up
i
could
git
up
thar
alone
but
i
could
do
no
work
but
thet
thar
pan
ought
ter
cum
out
all
right
dew
ye
think
ye
cud
hoi
me
up
cap
i
purty
durn
i
smiled
in
the
darkness
at
the
little
fellow
egotism
and
lifting
him
as
i
might
a
child
poised
him
lightly
upon
my
shoulder
he
struggled
a
moment
to
steady
himself
against
the
wall
and
then
i
could
feel
him
tugging
eagerly
at
something
which
appeared
to
yield
slowly
to
his
efforts
as
he
worked
a
dense
shower
of
dust
and
soot
caused
me
to
close
my
eyes
she
a
comin
all
right
he
said
cheerfully
puffing
with
his
exertions
but
i
reckon
as
how
this
chimbly
ai
bin
cleaned
out
since
ther
war
begun
hold
up
yer
right
han
cap
an
git
a
blame
good
grip
on
her
fer
she
almighty
full
an
wanter
go
down
sorter
easy
i
did
as
he
suggested
bracing
myself
to
meet
his
movements
as
he
stood
straining
on
my
shoulders
and
in
another
moment
i
had
succeeded
in
lowering
the
large
pan
silently
to
the
floor
room
yere
fer
two
men
ter
oncet
chuckled
my
companion
in
rare
delight
chief
in
silence
strode
before
yere
his
weight
left
my
shoulders
there
was
a
slight
scramble
another
shower
of
dirt
then
the
sound
of
his
voice
once
more
lift
up
yer
han
cap
dig
in
yer
toes
on
ther
stones
an
we
begin
our
he
grasped
my
wrists
with
a
strength
which
i
had
no
conception
the
little
fellow
possessed
there
was
a
moment
breathless
struggle
and
i
squirmed
through
the
opening
and
lay
panting
on
the
flat
slabs
which
composed
the
foot
of
the
great
funnel
to
afford
me
more
room
bungay
had
gone
up
a
little
finding
upon
the
uneven
stones
of
which
the
chimney
was
constructed
for
a
moment
we
rested
thus
motionless
both
breathing
heavily
and
listening
to
the
music
and
shuffling
of
feet
now
almost
upon
a
level
with
our
heads
the
noise
which
was
strong
and
continuous
rendered
discovery
from
any
misstep
highly
improbable
and
as
delay
was
dangerous
neither
of
us
was
disposed
to
linger
long
be
ye
all
ready
cap
questioned
bungay
bending
his
head
down
fer
if
ye
be
i
a
goin
all
right
i
answered
struggling
to
my
knees
in
the
narrow
space
only
take
it
slow
jed
i
a
trifle
bigger
man
than
you
and
this
is
rather
close
wal
yes
maybe
a
matter
of
a
poun
er
two
he
retorted
and
the
next
moment
i
could
hear
him
scraping
his
way
upward
feeling
for
foothold
upon
the
irregular
layers
of
stone
i
followed
pressing
my
knees
firmly
against
the
rough
wall
and
trusting
more
to
my
hands
than
feet
for
security
against
falling
there
was
evidently
a
fireplace
of
some
kind
on
the
first
floor
with
a
considerable
opening
leading
from
it
into
the
chimney
we
were
scaling
for
as
jed
slowly
passed
i
could
perceive
a
sudden
gleam
of
light
streaming
across
his
face
from
the
glare
of
the
lamps
within
he
glanced
anxiously
that
way
but
did
not
pause
in
his
steady
climb
upward
a
moment
later
i
came
opposite
that
same
beam
of
radiance
and
cautiously
peered
down
the
sloped
opening
that
led
to
the
disused
fireplace
all
i
could
perceive
was
a
pair
of
legs
evidently
those
of
a
cavalry
officer
judging
from
the
broad
yellow
stripe
down
the
seam
of
the
trousers
and
the
high
boots
ornamented
with
rowel
spurs
he
stood
leaning
carelessly
against
the
mantel
talking
with
some
one
just
beyond
the
range
of
my
vision
at
that
moment
the
music
ceased
suddenly
and
afraid
to
proceed
until
it
should
strike
up
again
i
braced
myself
securely
on
a
projecting
stone
and
bent
my
head
over
the
orifice
until
i
could
catch
a
portion
of
the
conversation
being
carried
on
by
my
unconscious
neighbors
no
said
the
cavalryman
gruffly
and
apparently
in
reply
to
some
previous
question
the
fellow
was
most
devilish
obstinate
tell
the
first
thing
even
a
threat
of
treating
him
as
a
spy
and
hanging
him
outright
proved
of
no
avail
but
sheridan
theory
is
that
lee
has
ordered
longstreet
to
hit
our
rear
while
he
makes
a
direct
attack
in
front
that
why
the
man
proposes
to
get
in
his
work
first
and
we
march
at
daylight
to
form
connection
with
hancock
by
jove
chesley
but
that
woman
in
black
over
there
with
follansbee
is
the
handsomest
picture
i
seen
south
of
the
line
mark
how
her
eyes
sparkle
and
how
prettily
the
light
gleams
in
her
hair
who
is
she
do
you
chance
to
know
yes
lisped
the
other
languidly
met
her
at
breakfast
headquarters
this
morning
deuced
pretty
and
all
that
mighty
good
style
too
but
taken
old
man
she
what
not
major
brennan
in
surprise
why
he
always
posed
as
a
bachelor
among
our
do
know
anything
about
that
dear
boy
indifferently
but
the
lady
came
in
with
him
yesterday
was
introduced
to
the
crowd
of
us
as
brennan
and
he
called
her
edith
deuced
nice
name
edith
as
brennan
has
shown
such
poor
taste
as
to
be
absent
i
inclined
to
give
a
little
of
my
time
to
his
lady
far
and
away
the
prettiest
thing
just
at
this
moment
i
heard
bungay
speaking
to
me
agonizingly
down
the
chimney
durn
it
all
cap
i
i
got
ter
there
was
a
smothered
struggle
in
the
darkness
above
me
then
a
muffled
explosion
that
showered
me
with
soot
and
sounded
to
my
startled
nerves
like
the
report
of
a
gun
i
drew
up
my
legs
hastily
and
had
barely
done
so
when
a
heavily
whiskered
face
peered
up
at
me
through
the
open
fireplace
it
appeared
so
close
i
had
no
doubt
he
saw
me
but
his
eyes
were
unable
to
penetrate
the
darkness
sounded
devilishly
like
a
sneeze
he
said
suspiciously
as
he
straightened
up
again
must
have
been
wind
in
the
more
likely
bats
returned
the
other
well
so
long
somers
see
you
in
the
morning
i
going
to
give
the
fair
edith
a
the
cavalry
legs
shifted
their
position
the
band
resumed
its
functions
and
in
the
renewed
activity
and
noise
i
began
again
the
toilsome
climb
my
mind
now
a
bewildered
chaos
between
my
plain
duty
to
lee
and
my
nearly
uncontrollable
desire
to
meet
once
more
the
woman
who
was
dancing
in
the
room
below
the
little
mountaineer
as
active
as
a
cat
and
not
especially
hampered
by
lack
of
room
in
which
to
work
was
well
above
me
by
this
time
the
chimney
acting
as
a
tube
brought
down
to
me
from
time
to
time
the
slight
noise
of
his
climbing
varied
by
an
occasional
exclamation
or
comment
but
i
could
perceive
no
other
evidence
of
his
presence
above
all
was
as
black
as
the
grave
holy
smoke
he
ejaculated
probably
unaware
that
he
was
giving
utterance
to
his
thoughts
that
was
a
sharp
rock
durn
if
thar
a
inch
o
skin
left
on
my
knee
whut
is
it
scott
ses
broken
arms
and
disarray
marked
the
fell
havoc
of
the
day
gee
if
mariar
cud
only
see
me
now
maybe
she
would
be
proud
dear
my
life
must
be
since
it
is
worthy
care
from
thee
yet

hold
but
idle
breath
when

or
honor
weighed
with
death
ough
stop
thet
who

o
my
fut
hush
your
racket
you
little
fool
i
said
angrily
do
you
want
the
whole
yankee
army
to
trap
us
here
like
rats
i
can
not
get
up
this
chimney
any
farther
it
is
growing
too
small
to
permit
my
body
to
is
thet
so
cap
he
asked
anxiously
whut
be
ye
goin
ter
dew
it
i
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
i
was
groping
about
in
the
darkness
of
our
narrow
quarters
to
see
if
i
could
determine
exactly
where
we
were
how
high
is
this
house
jed
do
you
know
three
stories
an
how
far
up
are
we
halfway
ther
third
story
i
reckon
must
be
jist
whar
ye
are
thet
i
stuck
my
fut
down
an
openin
reckon
was
fireplace
like
thet
one
on
ther
first
i
lowered
myself
silently
and
felt
along
the
stones
until
i
located
the
opening
and
roughly
measured
its
dimensions
i
shall
have
to
risk
crawling
out
here
jed
i
said
finally
for
i

calmly
as
the

as

could
hear
him
creeping
steadily
upward
it
soon
became
evident
that
his
progress
was
growing
slower
more
difficult
then
all
sounds
above
me
ceased
and
i
knew
he
must
have
attained

chapter
xiv
i
become
a
colonel
of
artillery
my
own
situation
at
this
moment
was
too
critical
too
full
of
peril
and
uncertainty
to
afford
opportunity
for
moralizing
over
bungay
chances
of
escape
only
one
possibility
lay
before
me
there
remained
no
choice
no
necessity
for
planning
it
is
pure
luck
which
pries
open
most
doors
of
life
and
it
was
upon
luck
alone
i
must
rely
now
i
have
often
wondered
since
how
i
ever
succeeded
in
squeezing
my
body
through
that
narrow
opening
into
the
empty
fireplace
without
at
least
knocking
over
something
during
the
difficult
passage
but
i
did
manage
working
my
way
down
slowly
creeping
inch
by
inch
like
a
snake
carefully
testing
each
object
i
touched
in
the
darkness
for
fear
of
its
proving
loose
until
i
finally
lay
stretched
at
full
length
upon
what
was
evidently
from
its
feeling
a
carpet
of
unusually
fine
texture
the
room
proved
to
be
an
inner
one
and
unlighted
a
bedchamber
as
i
soon
determined
for
my
outstretched
hands
encountered
the
posts
of
a
bed
then
a
slight
gust
of
air
partially
swept
aside
a
hanging
curtain
which
rustled
like
silk
and
i
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
the
adjacent
parlor
it
was
likewise
unillumined
but
the
door
leading
into
the
front
hall
stood
ajar
and
through
that
opening
there
poured
a
stream
of
radiance
together
with
the
incessant
hum
of
many
voices
in
animated
conversation
the
deep
blare
of
the
band
with
the
ceaseless
movement
of
dancing
feet
satisfying
myself
by
sense
of
touch
that
the
bed
was
unoccupied
for
i
was
far
too
experienced
a
soldier
to
leave
an
enemy
in
my
rear
i
crept
cautiously
forward
to
the
intercepting
curtain
and
drawing
it
aside
took
careful
survey
of
the
outer
apartment
it
was
a
large
and
handsomely
furnished
room
a
polished
mahogany
littered
with
papers
occupying
a
prominent
position
against
the
farther
wall
a
swivel
chair
stood
beside
it
and
across
its
back
hung
what
appeared
to
be
a
suit
of
clothing
i
saw
no
other
signs
of
human
occupancy
convinced
that
the
apartment
was
deserted
and
discovering
no
different
means
of
egress
i
crossed
the
room
on
tiptoe
and
peered
cautiously
out
into
the
hall
it
was
not
a
pleasing
prospect
to
one
in
my
predicament
the
lower
portion
judging
from
the
incessant
hum
of
voices
was
filled
with
people
who
were
either
unable
to
find
place
within
the
crowded
ballroom
or
else
preferred
greater
retirement
for
conversation
even
the
wide
stairway
had
been
partially
a
young
lieutenant
as
i
judged
from
his
sitting
just
beneath
the
landing
whispering
eagerly
into
the
attentive
ear
of
a
pronounced
blonde
who
shared
the
broad
carpeted
step
with
him
i
drew
back
noiselessly
to
figure
out
the
situation
and
determine
what
was
best
for
me
to
attempt
it
would
be
sheer
madness
to
venture
upon
a
passage
to
the
front
door
clad
as
i
was
in
gray
uniform
to
rush
through
that
jam
was
impossible
if
i
were
to
wait
until
the
dance
was
concluded
the
later
hours
of
the
night
might
indeed
yield
me
somewhat
clearer
passage
yet
it
was
hardly
probable
that
the
house
used
as
i
knew
it
to
be
for
a
military
prison
would
be
left
unguarded
besides
such
delay
must
absolutely
prevent
my
getting
beyond
the
federal
picket
lines
before
daybreak
and
would
hence
render
valueless
the
news
i
sought
to
bear
to
lee
i
moved
to
the
only
window
and
glanced
out
it
opened
upon
the
back
of
the
house
and
presented
a
sheer
drop
to
the
ground
at
the
slight
noise
of
the
moving
sash
a
sentry
standing
at
the
corner
glanced
up
suspiciously
evidently
each
side
of
the
great
building
was
abundantly
protected
by
patrols
something
had
to
be
attempted
and
at
once
the
room
i
was
in
bore
unquestionable
evidence
of
recent
occupancy
and
at
any
moment
might
be
my
searching
eyes
fell
upon
the
articles
of
clothing
carelessly
folded
over
the
i
picked
up
the
garments
one
by
one
and
shook
them
out
they
composed
the
new
uniform
of
a
colonel
of
artillery
and
were
resplendent
with
bright
red
facings
and
a
profusion
of
gold
braid
with
all
my
soul
i
loathed
the
thought
of
disguise
and
especially
the
hated
uniform
of
the
enemy
it
was
repugnant
to
every
instinct
of
my
being
and
would
certainly
mean
added
degradation
and
danger
in
the
event
of
capture
yet
i
saw
no
other
way
sheridan
brennan
caton
the
three
who
would
certainly
recognize
me
on
sight
i
was
assured
were
absent
although
they
might
return
at
any
moment
the
greater
reason
for
haste
the
less
excuse
for
delay
but
if
i
should
chance
to
run
foul
of
the
rightful
owner
of
the
garments
amid
that
crush
below
and
he
should
recognize
them
what
then
i
stood
close
beside
the
as
i
revolved
these
considerations
rapidly
in
mind
and
my
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
an
open
paper
it
was
an
official
order
bearing
date
at
that
same
day
commanding
colonel
culbertson
to
move
his
battery
at
once
down
the
kendallville
pike
and
report
to
knowls
for
assignment
to
his
brigade
evidently
the
new
dress
uniform
had
been
carefully
brushed
and
laid
out
to
be
worn
at
the
ball
that
evening
the
sudden
receipt
of
this
order
had
caused
the
owner
to
depart
hastily
in
his
service
dress
vigorously
expressing
his
feelings
no
doubt
while
his
servant
now
enjoying
liberty
below
stairs
had
neglected
to
pack
up
his
master
things
this
knowledge
was
the
straw
which
decided
me
i
would
chance
it
hastily
i
drew
on
the
rich
blue
and
red
over
my
old
gray
adding
the
dress
sword
i
had
discovered
in
a
closet
and
then
wondering
curiously
what
sort
of
figure
i
might
cut
in
all
these
fine
habiliments
sought
a
glance
at
myself
within
a
mirror
hanging
upon
the
bedroom
wall
faith
but
it
was
god
mercy
that
i
did
such
a
face
as
grinned
at
me
from
that
glass
peering
over
the
decorated
collar
would
surely
have
created
a
genuine
sensation
in
those
rooms
below
serious
as
my
situation
was
i
laughed
at
the
thought
of
it
until
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
leaving
white
streaks
the
full
length
of
them
for
no
in
the
full
tide
of
his
glorious
career
was
ever
worse
sooted
and
begrimed
i
thought
of
the
elegantly
dressed
lieutenant
and
the
blonde
young
lady
upon
the
stairs
surely
they
would
have
supposed
the
very
devil
himself
was
coming
down
it
took
me
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
get
myself
tolerably
clean
and
i
could
not
have
done
that
had
i
not
used
some
grease
that
was
upon
the
stand
at
the
end
however
i
stepped
back
from
the
glass
confident
that
with
good
luck
i
should
run
the
gantlet
safely
just
as
i
prepared
to
step
forth
a
new
thought
occurred
to
me
who
was
i
if
questioned
as
was
highly
probable
how
could
i
account
for
my
presence
who
should
i
pretend
to
be
i
turned
over
the
mass
of
papers
lying
before
me
on
the
table
they
were
mostly
accounts
and
detailed
orders
about
which
i
cared
nothing
but
finally
my
search
was
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
a
recent
army
list
i
ran
my
eyes
hastily
down
the
artillery

there
at

was

and
the
other
i
glanced
again
at
the
open
order
culbertson
fourteenth
i
would
remember
those
names
and
with
a
jaunty
confidence
in
my
success
born
of
thorough
preparation
i
stepped
to
the
open
door
and
strode
forth
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
hall
barring
the
single
accident
of
encountering
a
possible
acquaintance
in
the
throng
below
i
felt
fully
capable
of
deceiving
his
satanic
majesty
himself
chapter

at
the
staff
officers
ball
the
young
officer
glanced
up
hastily
at
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
and
rose
to
his
feet
to
permit
of
my
passage
he
wore
the
full
dress
uniform
of
an
artilleryman
and
his
evident
surprise
at
my
presence
made
me
realize
the
necessity
of
addressing
him
lieutenant
i
asked
courteously
resting
one
hand
easily
upon
the
balustrade
could
you
inform
me
if
general
sheridan
and
those
members
of
the
staff
who
accompanied
him
down
the
lines
this
afternoon
have
yet
returned
they
have
not
ah
i
was
in
hopes
they
might
have
arrived
by
this
time
i
see
that
you
belong
to
my
branch
of
the
service
may
i
inquire
your
battery
he
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
delicate
flattery
of
my
tone
and
in
true
soldierly
pride
of
his
corps
b
fifth
new
jersey
i
think
i
remember
them
in
action
no
better
command
in
the
service
you
were
at
gettysburg
on
seminary
ridge
sir
it
was
my
first
a
hard
baptism
of
fire
indeed
yet
a
remembrance
you
will
long
be
proud
to
recall
i
thank
you
for
your
i
bowed
to
them
both
and
passed
slowly
down
the
wide
stairway
several
couples
rising
as
i
drew
near
to
permit
of
my
passage
the
intense
excitement
of
the
strange
adventure
had
by
this
time
become
a
positive
delight
my
cheek
flushed
my
eyes
kindled
as
though
new
blood
flowed
in
my
veins
ah
i
thought
to
myself
proudly
what
a
story
it
will
all
make
for
the
and
if
i
reach
lee
in
time
the
tale
of
this
night
will
be
upon
the
lips
of
all
the
the
lower
hall
was
very
comfortably
filled
with
figures
moving
here
and
there
in
converse
or
occupying
seats
pressed
close
against
the
walls
the
greater
portion
were
attired
in
uniforms
of
the
various
branches
of
service
yet
i
observed
not
a
few
civilian
suits
and
a
considerable
number
of
women
some
wearing
the
neat
dress
of
the
army
nurse
others
much
more
elaborately
attired
daughters
of
the
neighborhood
probably
with
a
sprinkling
of
wives
and
sisters
of
the
soldiery
guards
leaning
upon
their
muskets
stood
in
statuesque
poses
on
either
side
of
the
main
entrance
while
the
wide
archway
draped
with
flags
opening
into
the
ballroom
revealed
an
inspiring
glimpse
of
swiftly
revolving
figures
in
gay
uniforms
and
flashing
skirts
over
all
floated
the
low
swinging
music
of
the
band
all
this
i
noted
as
i
paused
irresolutely
on
the
lower
stair
wondering
if
i
could
safely
walk
directly
out
of
that
front
door
ignoring
the
sentries
by
right
of
the
uniform
i
wore
and
thus
attain
the
open
air
the
constant
haunting
fear
of
the
early
return
of
sheridan
and
his
aides
or
a
possible
encounter
with
some
former
acquaintance
in
that
crushing
throng
almost
decided
me
upon
venturing
the
passage
but
already
i
had
hesitated
too
long
a
fat
man
of
forty
an
infantry
major
but
wearing
staff
decorations
and
evidently
officiating
in
the
capacity
of
after
whispering
a
word
in
the
ear
of
another
of
the
same
kind
beside
the
ballroom
door
hastily
pushed
his
way
through
the
laughing
throng
directly
toward
me
colonel
he
said
bowing
deeply
your
face
is
not
familiar
to
me
but
you
will
permit
me
to
introduce
myself
major
monsoon
of
general
sheridan
i
accepted
the
fat
shapeless
hand
he
extended
and
pressed
it
warmly
i
was
just
meditating
a
retreat
major
when
you
appeared
i
replied
frankly
for
i
fear
my
face
is
equally
unknown
to
all
others
present
indeed
i
feel
like
a
cat
in
a
strange
garret
and
hesitated
to
appear
at
all
my
only
excuse
for
doing
so
was
a
promise
made
colonel
culbertson
previous
to
his
being
ordered
out
on
duty
i
am
colonel
curran
of
the
sixth
ohio
but
at
present
serving
on
the
staff
of
general
halleck
at
the
major
round
red
face
glowed
with
welcome
extremely
pleased
to
meet
you
indeed
he
exclaimed
eagerly
and
you
may
be
sure
of
a
most
cordial
greeting
will
you
kindly
step
this
way
as
we
slowly
elbowed
our
way
forward
all
desire
to
escape
from
the
ordeal
fled
and
i
assumed
the
risks
of
the
masquerade
with
the
reckless
audacity
of
my
years
before
we
reached
the
ballroom
my
conductor
his
fat
countenance
fairly
beaming
with
cordiality
had
stopped
at
least
twenty
times
to
present
me
to
various
military
titles
and
i
had
accepted
innumerable
invitations
without
in
the
least
knowing
who
gave
them
or
where
they
were
to
be
fulfilled
finally
however
we
broke
through
the
massed
ring
and
succeeded
in
reaching
the
tall
individual
in
spectacles
to
whom
the
major
had
spoken
previous
to
seeking
me
and
i
learned
through
the
introduction
which
followed
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
carlton
chief
of
staff
for
a
moment
as
i
responded
to
the
hearty
cordiality
of
his
welcome
i
was
enabled
to
take
my
first
glance
at
the
ballroom
and
found
it
to
my
unaccustomed
soldier
eyes
an
inspiring
spectacle
the
room
was
magnificently
large
a
surprising
apartment
indeed
even
in
so
superb
a
southern
home
as
this
had
evidently
been
and
its
proportions
were
magnified
by
numerous
mirrors
extending
from
floor
to
ceiling
causing
the
more
distant
dancers
to
appear
circling
in
space
brilliantly
illumined
by
means
of
hanging
chandeliers
that
oscillated
slightly
to
the
merry
feet
decorated
lavishly
everywhere
with
festooned
flags
and
tastefully
arranged
munitions
of
war
gay
with
the
dress
uniforms
of
the
men
and
the
handsome
gowns
of
the
women
it
composed
a
scene
so
different
from
any
i
had
looked
upon
in
years
as
to
hold
me
fascinated
the
constant
clatter
of
tongues
the
merry
laughter
the
flashing
of
bright
eyes
and
the
gleam
of
snowy
shoulders
the
repartees
caught
as
the
various
couples
circled
swiftly
past
the
quick
musical
gliding
of
flying
feet
over
the
waxen
floor
the
continuous
whirl
of
the
intoxicating
waltz
and
over
all
the
inspiring
strains
of
strauss
caused
my
heart
to
bound
and
brought
with
it
an
insane
desire
to
participate
yet
gazing
entranced
upon
the
animated
scene
and
feeling
deeply
the
intoxication
of
the
moment
my
eyes
were
eagerly
searching
that
happy
throng
for
sight
of
one
fair
woman
face
strange
as
it
must
seem
to
others
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
meet
her
might
mean
betrayal
and
death
ay
might
even
result
in
the
destruction
of
an
army
in
my
weakness
i
secretly
longed
for
just
such
a
happening
felt
indeed
that
i
must
again
see
her
have
speech
with
her
before
i
went
forth
alone
into
the
manifold
dangers
of
the
night
it
was
foolhardiness
insanity
in
very
truth
yet
such
was
the
secret
yearning
of
my
heart
if
i
could
only
once
know
know
from
her
own
truthful
lips
that
she
already
belonged
to
another
i
could
i
believed
tear
her
image
from
my
memory
but
while
i
yet
doubted
and
in
spite
of
all
i
had
heard
i
doubted
still
no
desperate
case
should
ever
prevent
my
seeking
her
with
all
the
mad
ardor
of
love
no
faintness
of
heart
should
intervene
between
us
that
she
was
present
i
knew
from
those
chance
words
overheard
in
the
chimney
and
my
one
deep
hope
ever
since
i
donned
that
federal
uniform
and
ventured
down
the
stairs
a
hope
most
oddly
mingled
with
dread
was
that
we
might
in
some
manner
be
brought
together
i
was
yet
vainly
seeking
a
glimpse
of
her
among
the
many
who
circled
past
when
i
was
suddenly
recalled
to
the
extreme
delicacy
of
my
situation
by
the
deep
voice
of
the
major
asking
me
a
direct
question
do
you
ever
dance
colonel
exactly
what
i
may
have
replied
i
know
not
but
it
was
evidently
translated
as
an
affirmative
for
in
another
moment
i
was
being
piloted
down
the
side
of
the
long
room
while
he
gossiped
in
my
rather
inattentive
ear
as
you
have
doubtless
remarked
colonel
we
are
extremely
fortunate
in
our
ladies
by
jove
they
would
grace
an
inauguration
ball
at
washington
so
many
officers
wives
have
joined
us
lately
supposing
we
would
make
permanent
camp
here
and
besides
there
are
more
loyal
families
in
this
neighborhood
than
we
find
usually
at
least
their
loyalty
is
quite
apparent
while
we
remain
then
the
general
hospital
nurses
are
not
especially
busy
no
battle
lately
you
know
and
there
are
some
deuced
pretty
girls
among
them
ballroom
looks
nice
do
you
think
extremely
well
the
decorations
are
in
most
excellent
entirely
the
work
of
the
staff
great
pity
so
many
were
compelled
to
be
absent
but
a
soldier
can
never
tell
here
upon
special
duty
colonel
i
brought
despatches
from
the
president
to
general
wish
you
might
remain
with
us
permanently
your
command
i
believe
is
not
connected
with
our
eastern
army
no
with
thomas
in
the
ah
yes
had
some
very
pretty
fighting
out
there
i
understand
oh
pardon
me
miss
minor
permit
me
to
present
to
you
colonel
curran
of
general
halleck
staff
the
colonel
i
believe
is
as
able
a
dancer
as
he
is
a
soldier
and
no
higher
compliment
to
his
abilities
could
possibly
be
paid
miss
minor
colonel
is
a
native
virginian
who
is
present
under
protest
hoping
doubtless
to
capture
some
young
officer
and
thus
weaken
the
i
bowed
pleasantly
to
the
young
woman
facing
me
and
not
sorry
to
escape
the
major
inquisitiveness
at
once
begged
for
the
remainder
of
the
waltz
the
request
was
laughingly
granted
and
in
another
moment
we
were
threading
our
way
amid
the
numerous
couples
upon
the
floor
she
proved
so
delightful
a
dancer
that
i
simply
yielded
myself
up
to
full
enjoyment
of
the
measure
and
conversation
lapsed
until
a
sudden
cessation
of
the
music
left
us
stranded
so
close
to
the
fireplace
that
the
very
sight
of
it
brought
a
vivid
realization
of
my
perilous
position
if
it
had
not
my
companion
chance
remark
most
assuredly
would
how
easily
you
waltz
she
said
enthusiastically
her
sparkling
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
testifying
to
her
keen
enjoyment
so
many
find
me
difficult
to
keep
step
with
that
i
have
become
fearful
of
venturing
upon
the
floor
with
a
stranger
however
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
give
you
a
character
to
any
of
my
i
sincerely
thank
you
i
returned
in
the
same
spirit
and
i
can
certainly
return
the
compliment
most
heartily
it
is
so
long
since
i
was
privileged
to
dance
with
a
lady
that
i
confess
to
having
felt
decidedly
awkward
at
the
start
but
your
step
proved
so
accommodating
that
i
became
at
once
at
home
and
enjoyed
the
waltz
immensely
i
fail
to
discover
any
seats
in
the
room
or
i
should
endeavor
to
find
one
vacant
for
oh
i
am
not
in
the
least
she
was
looking
at
me
with
so
deep
an
expression
of
interest
in
her
eyes
that
i
dimly
wondered
at
it
did
i
understand
rightly
she
asked
playing
idly
with
her
fan
that
major
monsoon
introduced
you
to
me
as
colonel
curran
of
general
halleck
staff
what
the
deuce
am
i
up
against
now
i
thought
and
my
heart
beat
quickly
yet
retreat
was
impossible
and
i
answered
with
assumed
carelessness
i
am
most
assuredly
colonel
from
ohio
this
was
certainly
coming
after
me
with
a
vengeance
and
i
stole
one
quick
glance
at
the
girl
face
it
was
devoid
of
suspicion
merely
evincing
a
polite
interest
i
have
the
honor
of
commanding
the
sixth
artillery
regiment
from
that
you
must
pardon
me
colonel
for
my
seeming
inquisitiveness
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
demure
mischief
yet
i
can
not
quite
understand
i
was
at
school
in
connecticut
with
a
miss
curran
whose
father
was
an
officer
of
artillery
from
ohio
and
naturally
i
at
once
thought
of
her
when
the
major
pronounced
your
name
yet
it
certainly
can
not
be
you
you
are
altogether
too
young
for
myrtle
must
be
i
laughed
decidedly
relieved
from
what
i
feared
might
prove
a
most
awkward
situation
well
yes
miss
minor
i
am
indeed
somewhat
youthful
to
be
father
i
said
at
a
venture
but
i
might
serve
as
her
brother
you
know
and
not
stretch
the
point
of
age
she
clasped
her
hands
on
my
arm
with
a
gesture
of
delight
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
knew
myrtle
had
a
brother
but
never
heard
he
also
was
in
the
army
did
you
know
colonel
she
was
intending
to
come
down
here
with
me
when
i
returned
south
at
the
close
of
our
school
year
but
from
some
cause
was
disappointed
how
delighted
she
would
have
been
to
meet
you
i
shall
certainly
write
and
tell
her
what
a
splendidly
romantic
time
we
had
together
you
look
so
much
like
myrtle
i
wonder
i
failed
to
recognize
you
at
she
was
rattling
on
without
affording
me
the
slightest
opportunity
to
slip
in
a
word
explanatory
when
her
glance
chanced
to
fall
upon
some
one
who
was
approaching
us
through
the
throng
oh
by
the
way
colonel
there
is
another
of
myrtle
old
schoolmates
present
a
most
intimate
friend
indeed
who
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
permitted
you
to
go
without
meeting
she
drew
me
back
hastily
edith
she
said
touching
the
sleeve
of
a
young
woman
who
was
slowly
passing
edith
wait
just
a
moment
dear
this
is
colonel
curran
myrtle
curran
brother
you
know
colonel
curran
chapter
xvi
the
woman
i
loved
the
crucial
moment
had
arrived
and
i
think
my
heart
actually
stopped
beating
as
i
stood
gazing
helplessly
into
her
face
i
saw
her
eyes
open
wide
in
astonished
recognition
and
then
a
deep
flush
swept
over
throat
and
cheek
for
the
instant
i
believed
she
would
not
speak
or
that
she
would
give
way
to
her
excitement
and
betray
everything
i
durst
give
no
signal
of
warning
for
there
existed
no
tie
between
us
to
warrant
my
expecting
any
consideration
from
her
it
was
an
instant
so
tense
that
her
silence
seemed
like
a
blow
yet
it
was
only
an
instant
then
her
eyes
smiled
into
mine
most
frankly
and
her
hand
was
extended
i
am
more
than
delighted
to
meet
you
colonel
curran
she
said
calmly
although
i
could
feel
her
lips
tremble
to
the
words
while
the
fingers
i
held
were
like
ice
myrtle
was
one
of
my
dearest
friends
and
she
chanced
to
be
in
my
mind
even
as
we
met
that
was
why
she
added
turning
toward
miss
minor
as
though
she
felt
her
momentary
agitation
had
not
passed
unobserved
i
was
so
surprised
when
you
first
presented
colonel
i
confess
to
having
felt
strangely
myself
returned
the
other
archly
although
i
believe
i
concealed
my
feelings
far
better
than
you
did
edith
really
i
thought
you
were
going
to
faint
it
must
be
that
colonel
curran
exercises
some
strange
occult
influence
over
the
weaker
sex
perhaps
he
is
the
seventh
son
of
a
seventh
son
are
you
colonel
however
dear
i
am
safe
for
the
present
from
his
mysterious
spell
and
you
will
be
compelled
to
face
the
danger
alone
as
here
comes
lieutenant
hammersmith
to
claim
the
dance
i
promised
before
brennan
could
interfere
the
laughing
girl
had
placed
her
hand
on
the
lieutenant
blue
sleeve
and
with
a
mocking
flung
backward
over
her
shoulder
vanished
in
the
crowd
leaving
us
standing
there
alone
the
lady
waited
in
such
apparent
indifference
gently
tapping
the
floor
with
her
neatly
shod
foot
her
eyes
wandering
carelessly
over
the
throng
in
our
front
that
i
felt
utterly
at
sea
evidently
she
had
no
intention
of
addressing
me
yet
i
could
not
continue
to
stand
there
beside
her
in
silence
like
a
fool
that
she
possessed
a
pretty
temper
i
already
knew
but
better
a
touch
of
that
than
this
silent
disdain
would
you
be
exceedingly
angry
if
i
were
to
ask
you
to
dance
i
questioned
stealing
surreptitiously
a
glance
at
her
proudly
averted
face
angry
most
assuredly
not
in
apparent
surprise
yet
i
trust
you
will
not
ask
me
i
have
been
upon
the
floor
only
once
i
am
not
at
all
in
the
the
words
were
not
encouraging
yet
they
served
to
break
the
ice
and
i
was
never
easily
daunted
if
there
were
chairs
here
i
should
venture
to
ask
even
a
greater
favor
that
you
would
consent
to
sit
out
this
set
with
she
turned
slightly
lifted
her
eyes
inquiringly
to
mine
and
her
face
lightened
no
doubt
we
might
discover
seats
without
difficulty
in
the
anteroom
she
answered
indicating
the
direction
by
a
glance
there
do
not
appear
to
be
many
at
this
ball
and
the
few
who
do
are
not
if
the
pendulum
of
hope
and
despair
swings
one
way
the
unalterable
laws
of
mental
gravitation
compel
it
to
go
just
as
far
the
other
and
although
i
do
not
remember
uttering
so
much
as
a
word
while
we
traversed
the
crowded
floor
and
gained
entrance
to
the
smaller
room
beyond
yet
my
heart
was
singing
a
song
of
the
deepest
hope
the
apartment
contained
as
she
prophesied
but
few
occupants
and
i
conducted
her
to
the
farther
end
of
it
where
we
found
a
comfortable
divan
and
no
troublesome
neighbors
as
i
glanced
at
her
now
i
marked
a
distinct
change
in
her
face
the
old
indifference
so
well
assumed
while
we
were
in
the
presence
of
others
had
utterly
vanished
as
by
magic
and
she
sat
looking
at
me
in
anxious
yet
impetuous
questioning
captain
wayne
she
exclaimed
her
eyes
never
once
leaving
my
face
what
does
this
mean
this
masquerade
this
wearing
of
the
federal
uniform
this
taking
of
another
name
this
being
here
at
all
if
i
should
say
that
i
came
hoping
to
see
you
again
i
answered
scarce
knowing
how
best
to
proceed
or
how
far
to
put
confidence
in
her
what
would
you
think
the
color
flamed
quickly
into
her
cheeks
but
the
clear
eyes
never
faltered
they
seemed
to
read
my
very
soul
if
that
is
true
that
you
were
extremely
foolish
to
take
such
a
risk
for
so
small
a
reward
she
returned
calmly
nor
under
these
circumstances
would
i
remain
here
so
much
as
a
moment
to
encourage
you
but
it
is
not
true
this
is
no
light
act
your
very
life
must
lie
in
the
balance
or
you
could
never
assume
such
risk
doubtless
you
hesitate
to
trust
me
fully
but
i
assure
you
you
need
not
for
you
have
placed
me
under
certain
personal
obligations
which
i
have
no
desire
to
ignore
captain
wayne
you
are
in
trouble
in
danger
will
you
not
tell
me
all
and
permit
me
to
aid
you
by
every
means
in
my
power
i
would
trust
you
gladly
with
my
life
or
my
honor
i
replied
soberly
if
i
had
less
faith
in
you
i
should
not
be
here
she
started
slightly
at
the
words
and
for
an
instant
her
eyes
fell
your
life
she
questioned
do
you
mean
that
is
in
the
balance
i
understand
that
i
am
condemned
to
be
shot
as
a
spy
at
shot
on
what
authority
who
told
you
on
the
order
of
general
sheridan
my
informant
was
lieutenant
caton
of
his
shot
as
a
spy
why
it
surely
can
not
be
frank
said
captain
wayne
believe
me
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
all
this
do
not
think
i
should
ever
have
rested
if
i
had
dreamed
that
you
were
held
under
so
false
a
charge
i
promised
you
i
would
see
general
sheridan
on
your
yes
i
assented
hastily
for
her
agitation
was
so
great
i
feared
it
might
attract
the
attention
of
others
i
remember
you
said
so
at
the
time
of
my
arrest
but
supposed
you
had
either
forgotten
or
had
found
your
intercession
why
how
you
must
have
despised
me
forgotten
her
eyes
filled
instantly
with
tears
not
for
an
hour
captain
wayne
but
frank
she
bit
her
lip
impatiently
i
was
told
that
is
i
was
led
to
believe
that
you
were
had
been
sent
north
as
a
prisoner
of
war
late
last
night
otherwise
i
should
have
insisted
upon
seeing
you
on
pleading
your
cause
with
the
general
himself
the
major
and
i
breakfasted
with
him
this
morning
but
your
name
was
not
mentioned
for
i
believed
you
she
did
not
appear
to
realize
so
deep
was
her
present
indignation
and
regret
that
my
hand
had
found
a
upon
her
own
you
must
believe
me
captain
wayne
i
could
not
bear
to
have
you
feel
that
i
could
prove
such
an
you
need
never
suppose
i
should
think
that
i
replied
with
an
earnestness
of
manner
that
caused
her
to
glance
at
me
in
surprise
i
confidently
expected
to
hear
from
you
all
day
and
finally
when
no
word
came
i
became
convinced
some
such
misconception
as
you
have
mentioned
must
have
occurred
then
it
became
my
turn
to
act
upon
my
own
behalf
if
i
would
preserve
my
life
yet
never
for
one
moment
have
i
doubted
you
or
the
sincerity
of
your
pledge
to
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
my
clasp
gently
and
not
unkindly
then
passed
it
through
the
masses
of
her
dark
shining
hair
but
her
face
remained
turned
aside
from
me
oh
how
i
longed
at
that
moment
to
pour
forth
in
fervent
words
the
affection
that
burned
within
my
heart
but
irrespective
of
the
doubt
as
to
her
being
free
to
listen
to
such
a
declaration
there
was
a
pride
about
her
manner
a
certain
restraint
which
she
ever
seemed
to
exercise
over
me
that
effectually
sealed
my
lips
her
very
presence
was
a
moral
tonic
and
i
felt
it
would
be
easier
to
tear
out
my
tongue
than
to
utter
anything
which
she
could
construe
into
possible
insult
the
very
depth
of
her
perfect
womanhood
was
itself
protection
and
until
the
veil
was
finally
lifted
my
lips
were
vowed
to
silence
she
waited
quietly
while
a
couple
passed
us
and
sought
seats
nearer
the
door
tell
me
the
entire
story
she
said
gently
as
quickly
as
possible
i
reviewed
the
salient
events
which
had
occurred
since
our
last
meeting
without
denying
the
presence
of
major
brennan
during
my
stormy
meeting
with
general
sheridan
i
did
not
dwell
upon
it
nor
mention
the
personal
affray
that
had
occurred
between
us
even
had
i
not
supposed
the
man
to
be
her
husband
i
should
never
have
taken
advantage
of
his
treachery
to
advance
my
own
cause
god
knows
i
have
enough
failings
to
account
for
but
i
have
never
done
my
fighting
in
the
dark
neither
did
i
speak
of
the
information
i
now
sought
to
bring
to
lee
for
her
sympathy
her
interest
her
loyalty
were
all
with
the
opposing
army
she
followed
my
narrative
eagerly
her
eyes
growing
darker
with
intensity
of
interest
as
i
depicted
our
eventful
climb
up
the
black
chimney
and
my
venture
down
the
stairs
into
the
crowded
ballroom
as
i
concluded
there
was
a
tear
glistening
on
her
long
lashes
but
she
seemed
unconscious
of
it
and
made
no
attempt
to
dash
it
away
you
have
not
told
me
all
she
commented
quietly
but
i
can
understand
and
appreciate
the
reason
for
your
silence
i
know
frank
impetuosity
and
you
are
very
kind
captain
wayne
to
spare
my
feelings
but
you
must
not
remain
here
every
moment
of
delay
increases
your
danger
sheridan
and
those
of
his
staff
who
would
surely
recognize
you
were
expected
back
before
this
and
may
appear
at
any
moment
yet
how
can
you
get
away
how
is
it
possible
for
me
to
assist
you
there
was
an
eager
anxiety
in
her
face
that
piqued
me
like
most
lovers
i
chose
to
give
it
a
wrong
interpretation
you
are
anxious
to
be
rid
of
me
i
asked
ashamed
of
the
words
even
as
i
uttered
them
that
remark
is
unworthy
of
you
and
she
arose
to
her
feet
almost
haughtily
my
sole
thought
in
this
is
the
terrible
risk
you
incur
in
remaining
your
interest
then
is
personal
to
me
may
i
believe
i
am
a
loyal
woman
proudly
and
would
do
nothing
whatever
to
imperil
the
cause
of
my
country
but
your
condemnation
is
unjust
and
i
am
in
a
measure
responsible
for
it
i
assist
you
captain
wayne
for
your
own
sake
and
in
response
to
my
individual
sense
of
god
knows
i
could
not
speak
although
my
heart
seemed
bursting
within
my
bosom
by
sheer
power
of
her
will
her
pride
her
perfect
womanhood
she
held
me
from
her
as
though
a
wall
divided
us
not
for
an
instant
did
she
permit
me
to
forget
that
she
was
the
wife
of
another
have
you
formulated
any
plan
she
asked
quickly
and
her
rising
color
made
me
feel
that
she
had
deciphered
my
struggle
in
my
eyes
only
to
walk
out
under
protection
of
this
uniform
and
when
once
safe
in
the
open
to
trust
that
same
good
fortune
which
has
thus
far
befriended
she
shook
her
head
doubtfully
and
stood
a
moment
in
silence
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
moving
figures
in
the
room
beyond
i
fear
it
can
not
be
done
without
arousing
suspicion
she
said
at
last
slowly
i
chance
to
know
there
are
unusual
precautions
being
taken
and
the
entire
camp
is
doubly
patrolled
even
this
house
has
a
cordon
of
guards
about
it
but
for
what
reason
i
have
not
learned
no
she
spoke
decisively
there
is
no
other
way
captain
wayne
i
am
going
to
try
to
save
you
but
in
doing
so
i
must
trust
my
reputation
in
your
i
will
protect
it
with
my
protect
it
with
your
silence
rather
i
know
you
to
be
a
gentleman
or
i
should
never
attempt
to
carry
out
the
only
means
of
escape
which
seems
at
all
feasible
discovery
would
place
me
in
an
extremely
embarrassing
position
and
i
must
rely
upon
you
to
protect
me
from
such
a
i
beg
you
i
began
do
not
compromise
yourself
in
any
way
for
my
but
i
am
myself
already
deeply
involved
in
this
she
interrupted
and
i
could
retain
no
peace
of
mind
were
i
to
do
otherwise
now
listen
make
your
way
back
to
the
ballroom
and
in
fifteen
minutes
from
now
be
engaged
in
conversation
with
general
carlton
near
the
main
entrance
i
shall
join
you
there
and
you
will
take
your
cue
from
me
you
understand
perfectly
but
there
is
no
captain
wayne
only
do
not
fail
our
eyes
met
for
an
instant
what
she
read
in
mine
god
knows
in
hers
was
determination
with
a
daring
strange
to
woman
the
next
moment
she
had
vanished
through
a
side
door
and
i
was
alone
chapter
xvii
through
the
camp
of
the
enemy
a
glance
at
my
watch
told
me
that
it
was
already
within
a
few
moments
of
midnight
there
was
however
no
diminution
in
the
festivities
and
i
waited
in
silence
until
i
heard
the
sentries
calling
the
hour
and
then
pressed
my
way
back
into
the
noisy
crowded
ballroom
i
was
stopped
twice
by
officers
whom
i
had
met
earlier
in
the
evening
but
breaking
away
from
them
after
the
exchange
of
a
sentence
or
two
i
urged
my
course
as
directly
as
possible
toward
where
the
spectacled
brigadier
yet
held
his
post
as
master
of
ceremonies
we
had
been
conversing
pleasantly
for
several
minutes
when
brennan
appeared
standing
so
as
to
face
the
stairs
i
saw
her
first
coming
down
and
noted
that
she
wore
her
hat
and
had
a
light
thrown
over
her
shoulders
my
heart
beat
faster
as
i
realized
for
the
first
time
that
she
intended
to
be
my
companion
oh
general
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
find
you
yet
here
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
up
and
extended
a
neatly
gloved
hand
to
him
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
which
i
am
told
you
alone
have
the
authority
to
he
bowed
gallantly
i
am
very
sure
he
returned
smilingly
that
brennan
will
never
request
anything
which
i
would
not
gladly
she
flashed
her
eyes
brightly
into
his
face
most
assuredly
not
the
fact
is
general
colonel
curran
with
whom
i
see
you
are
already
acquainted
was
to
pass
the
night
at
the
quarters
and
as
he
has
not
yet
returned
the
duty
has
naturally
devolved
upon
me
to
see
our
guest
safely
deposited
we
are
at
the
mitchell
house
you
remember
which
is
beyond
the
inner
lines
and
while
of
course
i
have
been
furnished
with
a
pass
she
held
up
the
paper
for
his
inspection
and
have
been
also
instructed
as
to
the
countersign
i
fear
this
will
scarcely
suffice
for
the
safe
passage
of
the
the
general
laughed
evidently
pleased
with
her
assumption
of
military
knowledge
colonel
curran
is
certainly
to
be
congratulated
upon
having
found
so
charming
a
guide
madam
and
i
can
assure
you
i
shall
most
gladly
do
my
part
toward
the
success
of
the
expedition
the
major
was
expected
back
before
this
i
believe
he
left
word
that
if
he
had
not
returned
by
twelve
i
was
to
wait
for
him
no
longer
as
he
should
go
directly
to
his
quarters
i
find
the
life
of
a
soldier
to
be
extremely
we
are
our
country
servants
madam
he
replied
proudly
and
then
taking
out
a
pad
of
blanks
from
his
pocket
turned
to
me
may
i
ask
your
full
name
and
rank
colonel
patrick
curran
colonel
sixth
ohio
light
he
wrote
it
down
rapidly
tore
off
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
me
that
will
take
you
safely
through
our
inner
guard
lines
he
said
gravely
that
being
as
far
as
my
jurisdiction
extends
colonel
she
smiled
her
to
him
and
placed
a
gloved
hand
confidingly
on
my
arm
i
believe
i
recall
the
road
and
shall
find
no
difficulty
in
guiding
you
she
said
at
least
we
can
not
go
so
very
far
how
cool
and
she
appeared
no
hurry
no
outward
nervousness
marred
a
single
action
i
felt
my
heart
throb
with
pride
of
her
as
i
marked
the
marvellous
which
characterized
every
movement
for
i
realized
now
that
her
risk
in
the
adventure
was
scarcely
second
to
my
own
as
i
ventured
life
she
ventured
honor
and
i
doubted
not
hers
was
the
harder
task
of
the
two
yet
she
gave
no
outward
sign
of
struggle
as
we
crossed
the
crowded
hall
i
could
note
no
lack
of
resolution
no
faltering
of
purpose
in
either
step
or
voice
at
the
door
an
officer
spoke
to
her
surely
you
are
not
leaving
us
so
early
brennan
he
questioned
anxiously
why
supper
has
not
even
been
i
felt
her
hand
close
more
tightly
upon
my
arm
unfortunately
we
must
she
replied
in
a
tone
expressive
of
deep
regret
the
major
was
to
go
directly
to
his
quarters
if
he
was
not
here
by
midnight
and
would
surely
worry
were
i
still
absent
have
you
ever
met
my
friend
pardon
me
captain
burns
colonel
we
bowed
ceremoniously
and
the
next
moment
brennan
and
i
were
out
upon
the
steps
breathing
the
cool
night
air
i
glanced
curiously
at
her
face
as
the
gleam
of
light
fell
upon
it
how
calm
and
reserved
she
appeared
and
yet
her
eyes
were
aglow
with
intense
excitement
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
glanced
up
at
the
dark
projecting
roof
far
above
us
do
you
suppose
he
can
possibly
be
up
there
yet
she
asked
in
a
tone
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
to
the
ears
of
the
sentry
who
bungay
i
questioned
in
surprise
for
my
thoughts
were
elsewhere
oh
he
was
like
a
cat
and
there
are
trees
at
the
rear
probably
he
is
safe
long
ago
or
else
a
prisoner
once
beyond
the
gleam
of
the
uncovered
windows
all
was
wrapped
in
complete
darkness
save
that
here
and
there
we
could
distinguish
the
dull
red
glare
of
where
the
company
cooks
were
yet
at
work
or
some
sentry
post
had
been
established
all
the
varied
sounds
of
a
congested
camp
at
night
were
in
the
air
the
champing
and
pounding
of
horses
the
murmur
of
men
voices
the
distant
rumbling
of
heavy
wagons
with
an
occasional
shout
and
the
noise
of
axes
it
was
also
evident
from
the
numerous
flitting
lanterns
like
so
many
the
late
labors
of
the
cooks
and
other
unmistakable
signs
that
active
preparations
for
an
early
movement
were
already
well
under
way
we
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
proceeded
down
a
comparatively
smooth
road
which
seemed
to
me
to
possess
a
rock
basis
it
felt
so
hard
from
the
position
of
the
stars
i
judged
our
course
to
be
eastward
but
the
night
was
sufficiently
obscured
to
shroud
all
objects
more
than
a
few
yards
distant
except
for
the
varied
camp
noises
on
either
side
of
us
the
evening
was
oppressively
still
and
the
air
had
the
late
chill
of
high
altitudes
brennan
pressed
more
closely
to
me
as
we
passed
beyond
the
narrow
zone
of
light
and
unconsciously
we
fell
into
step
together
are
you
chilled
i
asked
bending
my
head
toward
her
not
in
the
least
but
i
must
confess
to
i
think
we
both
recalled
my
wrapping
her
in
the
flapping
cavalry
cloak
the
night
we
were
first
alone
together
for
she
added
quickly
i
am
quite
warmly
clothed
and
have
not
far
to
one
often
receives
certain
impressions
without
in
the
least
knowing
by
what
means
they
are
conveyed
some
peculiar
trick
of
tone
or
manner
teaching
a
lesson
the
lips
refrain
from
expressing
some
such
influence
now
unconsciously
exerted
possibly
made
me
feel
that
my
companion
preferred
to
remain
silent
that
i
could
best
prove
my
respect
for
her
by
quietly
accepting
her
guidance
without
attempting
converse
we
walked
slowly
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
as
it
was
impossible
to
say
that
we
were
unobserved
once
she
slipped
upon
a
stone
and
i
caught
her
but
neither
spoke
then
there
came
the
sudden
clatter
of
hoofs
on
the
rocky
road
behind
us
i
drew
her
swiftly
aside
within
the
protecting
shadow
of
a
tree
while
a
mounted
officer
rode
by
us
at
a
slashing
gait
his
cavalry
cape
pulled
high
over
his
head
and
the
iron
shoes
of
his
horse
striking
fire
from
the
flinty
rocks
i
could
feel
the
heart
of
the
girl
beating
wildly
against
my
arm
but
without
exchanging
so
much
as
a
word
we
crept
back
into
the
dark
road
and
pressed
on
a
few
hundred
yards
farther
a
fire
burned
redly
against
a
pile
of
logs
the
forms
of
several
men
lay
outstretched
beside
it
while
a
sentry
paced
back
and
forth
in
and
out
of
the
range
of
light
we
were
almost
upon
him
before
he
noted
our
approach
and
in
his
haste
he
swung
his
musket
down
from
his
shoulder
until
the
point
of
its
bayonet
nearly
touched
my
breast
halt
he
cried
sternly
peering
at
us
in
evident
surprise
halt
this
road
is
valley
forge
whispered
the
girl
and
i
noticed
how
white
her
face
appeared
in
the
flaming
of
the
fire
the
word
is
all
right
miss
returned
the
fellow
stoutly
yet
without
lowering
his
obstructing
gun
but
we
can
not
pass
any
one
out
on
the
countersign
alone
if
you
was
going
the
other
way
it
would
but
we
are
returning
from
the
officers
ball
she
urged
anxiously
and
are
on
our
way
to
major
brennan
quarters
we
have
as
she
drew
the
paper
from
out
her
glove
one
of
the
men
at
the
fire
sprang
to
his
feet
and
strode
across
the
narrow
road
toward
us
he
was
smooth
of
face
and
boyish
looking
but
wore
corporal
stripes
what
is
it
mapes
he
asked
sharply
without
waiting
an
answer
he
took
the
paper
she
held
out
and
scanned
it
rapidly
this
is
all
right
he
said
handing
it
back
and
lifting
his
cap
in
salute
you
may
pass
madam
you
must
pardon
us
but
the
orders
are
exceedingly
strict
have
you
a
pass
also
colonel
i
handed
it
to
him
and
after
a
single
glance
it
was
returned
pass
them
guard
he
said
curtly
standing
aside
beyond
the
radiance
of
the
fire
she
broke
the
silence
i
shall
only
be
able
to
go
with
you
so
far
as
the
summit
of
the
hill
yonder
for
our
quarters
are
just
to
the
right
and
i
could
furnish
no
excuse
for
being
found
beyond
that
point
she
said
do
you
know
enough
of
the
country
to
make
the
lines
of
your
army
if
this
is
the
kendallville
pike
we
are
on
i
answered
i
have
a
pretty
clear
conception
of
what
lies
ahead
but
i
should
be
very
glad
to
know
where
i
am
to
look
for
the
outer
there
is
one
post
at
the
ford
over
the
white
briar
she
replied
i
chance
to
know
this
because
major
brennan
selected
the
station
and
remarked
that
the
stream
was
so
high
and
rapid
as
to
be
impassable
at
any
other
point
for
miles
but
i
regret
this
is
as
far
as
my
information
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
but
how
may
i
ever
sufficiently
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
i
exclaimed
warmly
pressing
her
arm
to
my
side
as
i
spoke
with
the
intensity
of
feeling
which
possessed
me
i
require
no
thanks
save
as
expressed
by
your
silence
she
returned
almost
coldly
and
slightly
withdrawing
herself
i
have
merely
repaid
my
indebtedness
to
i
started
to
say
something
what
i
hardly
know
when
almost
without
sound
of
warning
a
little
squad
of
horsemen
swept
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
our
front
their
forms
darkly
outlined
against
the
starlit
sky
and
rode
down
toward
us
at
a
sharp
trot
i
had
barely
time
to
swing
my
companion
out
of
the
track
when
they
clattered
by
their
heads
bent
low
to
the
wind
and
seemingly
oblivious
to
all
save
the
movements
of
their
leader
sheridan
i
whispered
for
even
in
that
dimness
i
had
not
failed
to
recognize
the
short
erect
figure
which
rode
in
front
the
woman
shuddered
and
drew
closer
within
my
protecting
shadow
then
out
of
the
darkness
there
burst
a
solitary
rider
his
horse
limping
as
if
crippled
and
would
have
ridden
us
down
had
i
not
flung
up
one
hand
and
grasped
his
great
scott
what
have
we
here
he
cried
roughly
peering
down
at
us
by
all
the
gods
a
woman
the
hand
upon
my
arm
clutched
me
desperately
and
my
own
heart
seemed
to
choke
back
every
utterance
the
voice
was
brennan
chapter
xviii
the
reputation
of
a
woman
like
a
flash
occurred
to
me
the
only
possible
means
by
which
we
might
escape
open
discovery
an
instant
disclosure
of
my
supposed
rank
coupled
with
indignant
protest
already
believing
me
merely
some
private
soldier
straying
out
of
bounds
with
a
woman
of
the
camp
as
companion
he
had
thrown
himself
from
the
saddle
to
investigate
whatever
was
to
be
done
must
be
accomplished
quickly
or
it
would
prove
all
too
late
to
think
was
to
act
stepping
instantly
in
front
of
the
shrinking
girl
and
facing
him
i
said
sternly
i
do
not
know
who
you
may
chance
to
be
sir
nor
greatly
care
yet
your
words
and
actions
imply
an
insult
to
this
lady
which
i
am
little
disposed
to
overlook
for
your
information
permit
me
to
state
i
am
colonel

and
am
not
accustomed
to
being
halted
on
the
road
by
every
drunken
fool

he
stopped
short
in
complete
surprise
staring
at
me
through
the
darkness
and
i
doubted
not
was
perfectly
able
to
distinguish
the
glint
of
buttons
and
gleam
of
braid
your
pardon
sir
he
ejaculated
at
last
i
mistook
you
for
some
runaway
soldier
but
i
failed
to
catch
your
words
how
did
you
name
yourself
colonel
curran
of
halleck
the
hell
you
are
curran
had
a
full
gray
beard
a
month
he
took
a
step
forward
and
before
i
could
recover
from
the
first
numbing
shock
of
surprise
was
peering
intently
into
my
face
damn
it
he
cried
tugging
viciously
at
a
revolver
in
his
belt
i
know
that
face
you
are
the
measly
johnny
reb
i
brought
in
day
before
i
could
mark
the
flash
of
the
stars
on
the
blue
steel
of
his
pistol
barrel
and
knew
from
the
eager
ring
of
his
voice
he
exulted
in
the
hope
that
i
would
give
him
excuse
to
fire
yet
i
thought
in
that
moment
of
but
one
thing
the
woman
who
had
compromised
her
name
to
help
me
to
attain
freedom
i
would
have
died
a
thousand
deaths
if
it
might
only
be
with
my
hands
at
his
throat
her
story
unknown
yet
even
as
i
braced
my
body
for
the
leap
gazing
straight
into
that
deadly
barrel
there
came
a
quick
flutter
of
drapery
at
my
side
and
she
pressing
me
firmly
backward
faced
him
without
a
word
the
man
extended
arm
dropped
to
his
side
as
though
pierced
by
a
bullet
and
he
took
one
step
backward
shrinking
as
if
his
startled
eyes
beheld
a
ghost
edith
he
cried
as
though
doubting
his
own
vision
and
the
ring
of
agony
in
his
voice
was
almost
piteous
edith
my
god
you
here
at
midnight
alone
with
this
man
however
the
words
the
tone
the
gesture
may
have
stung
her
her
face
remained
proudly
calm
her
voice
cold
and
clear
i
certainly
am
major
brennan
she
answered
her
eyes
never
once
leaving
his
face
and
may
i
ask
what
reason
you
can
have
to
object
reason
his
voice
had
grown
hoarse
with
passion
and
surprise
my
god
how
can
you
ask
how
can
you
even
face
me
why
do
you
not
sink
down
in
shame
alone
here
he
looked
about
him
into
the
darkness
at
such
an
hour
in
company
with
a
rebel
a
sneaking
cowardly
spy
already
condemned
to
be
shot
by
heaven
he
shall
never
live
to
boast
of
it
he
flung
up
his
revolver
barrel
to
prove
the
truth
of
his
threat
but
she
stepped
directly
between
us
and
shielded
me
with
her
form
put
down
your
pistol
she
ordered
coldly
i
assure
you
my
reputation
is
in
no
immediate
danger
unless
you
shoot
me
and
your
bullet
shall
certainly
find
my
heart
before
it
ever
reaches
captain
truly
you
must
indeed
love
him
he
sneered
so
close
to
me
was
she
standing
that
i
could
feel
her
form
tremble
at
this
insult
yet
her
voice
remained
emotionless
your
words
shame
me
not
my
actions
in
being
here
with
captain
wayne
i
am
merely
paying
a
simple
debt
of
honor
a
double
debt
indeed
considering
that
he
was
condemned
to
death
by
your
lie
while
you
deceived
me
by
did
he
tell
you
that
he
did
not
like
the
true
gentleman
he
has
ever
shown
himself
to
be
he
endeavored
to
disguise
the
facts
to
withhold
from
me
all
knowledge
of
your
dastardly
action
i
know
it
by
the
infamous
sentence
pronounced
against
him
and
by
your
falsehood
to
edith
you
mistake
he
urged
anxiously
i
i
was
told
that
he
had
been
sent
she
drew
a
deep
breath
as
though
she
could
scarcely
grasp
the
full
audacity
of
his
pretence
to
ignorance
you
appeared
to
be
fully
informed
but
now
as
to
his
death
yes
i
heard
of
it
while
away
and
intended
telling
you
as
soon
as
i
reached
our
i
could
feel
the
scorn
of
his
miserable
deception
as
it
curled
her
lip
and
her
figure
seemed
to
straighten
between
us
then
she
said
slowly
you
will
doubtless
agree
that
i
have
done
no
more
than
was
right
and
will
therefore
permit
him
this
chance
of
escape
from
so
unmerited
a
fate
for
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
has
been
wrongly
he
stepped
forward
with
a
oath
and
rested
one
hand
heavily
upon
her
shoulder
an
exceedingly
neat
trap
he
said
with
a
grim
laugh
a
most
ingenious
snare
yet
hardly
one
i
am
likely
to
be
caught
in
i
am
not
quite
so
green
my
lady
what
let
that
fellow
go
become
the
laughing
stock
of
you
and
your
johnny
reb
lover
i
rather
guess
not
madam
damn
him
i
will
hang
him
now
higher
than
haman
just
to
show
queen
esther
that
it
can
be
done
out
of
the
way
madam
rendered
desperate
by
her
slight
resistance
and
his
own
jealous
hatred
he
thrust
the
woman
aside
so
rudely
that
she
fell
forward
upon
one
knee
his
revolver
was
yet
in
his
right
hand
gleaming
in
the
starlight
but
before
he
could
raise
or
fire
it
i
had
grasped
the
steel
barrel
firmly
and
the
hammer
came
down
noiselessly
upon
the
flesh
of
my
thumb
the
next
instant
we
were
locked
close
together
in
fierce
struggle
for
the
mastery
he
was
the
heavier
stronger
man
i
the
younger
and
quicker
from
the
first
every
effort
on
both
sides
was
put
forth
solely
to
gain
command
of
the
weapon
his
to
fire
mine
to
prevent
for
i
knew
well
at
the
sound
of
the
discharge
there
would
come
a
rush
of
to
his
rescue
my
first
fierce
onset
had
put
him
on
the
defensive
but
as
we
tugged
and
strained
his
superiority
in
weight
began
to
tell
and
slowly
he
bore
me
backward
desperately
contesting
every
inch
i
was
thus
compelled
to
yield
we
struggled
voiceless
neither
having
breath
for
useless
speech
and
each
realizing
that
the
end
would
probably
mean
death
either
to
the
one
or
the
other
only
our
heavy
breathing
the
quick
shuffling
of
feet
on
the
stony
road
and
an
occasional
rending
of
cloth
evinced
the
desperation
in
which
we
strove
once
as
we
turned
partially
in
the
struggle
i
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
woman
standing
helpless
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
the
sight
yielded
me
new
strength
and
determination
for
her
sake
i
must
win
even
as
this
thought
came
my
burly
antagonist
pressed
me
backward
until
all
the
weight
of
my
body
rested
upon
my
right
leg
then
there
occurred
to
me
like
a
flash
a
wrestler
trick
taught
me
years
before
by
an
old
negro
on
my
plantation
instantly
i
appeared
to
yield
to
the
force
against
which
i
contended
with
simulated
weakness
sinking
lower
and
lower
until
i
doubt
not
brennan
felt
convinced
i
must
go
over
backward
but
as
i
thus
sank
my
left
foot
found
steady
support
farther
back
while
my
free
hand
sank
slowly
down
his
straining
body
until
my
groping
fingers
grasped
firmly
the
broad
belt
about
his
waist
i
yielded
yet
another
inch
until
he
leaned
so
far
over
me
as
to
be
out
of
all
balance
and
then
with
sudden
straightening
of
my
left
leg
at
the
same
time
forcing
my
head
beneath
his
chest
in
leverage
with
one
tremendous
effort
i
flung
him
head
under
crashing
down
upon
the
hard
road
trembling
like
a
reed
from
the
exertion
i
stood
there
looking
down
upon
the
dark
form
lying
huddled
at
my
feet
he
rested
motionless
and
i
bent
over
placing
my
hand
upon
his
heart
horrified
at
the
mere
thought
that
he
might
be
dead
but
the
heart
beat
and
with
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
i
looked
up
she
stood
beside
me
tell
me
captain
wayne
she
exclaimed
anxiously
he
is
not
not
seriously
hurt
the
words
thoroughly
aroused
me
and
i
recalled
instantly
her
probable
relationship
to
this
man
her
delicate
position
now
i
believe
not
i
answered
soberly
he
is
a
heavy
man
and
fell
hard
yet
his
heart
beats
strong
he
must
have
cut
his
head
upon
a
stone
however
for
he
is
she
knelt
beside
him
and
i
caught
the
whiteness
of
a
handkerchief
within
her
hand
believe
me
brennan
i
faltered
lamely
i
regret
this
far
more
than
i
can
tell
nothing
has
ever
occurred
to
me
to
give
greater
pain
than
the
thought
that
i
have
brought
you
so
much
of
sorrow
and
she
held
up
her
hand
to
me
and
i
took
it
humbly
it
was
in
no
way
your
fault
pray
do
not
consider
that
i
can
ever
blame
you
for
the
her
eyes
were
upon
me
i
could
view
her
face
in
the
starlight
and
for
the
moment
i
utterly
forgot
the
man
who
rested
there
between
us
if
you
could
only
know
i
exclaimed
eagerly
how
sincerely
i
long
to
serve
you
to
atone
in
some
small
way
for
all
the
difficulty
i
have
brought
into
your
life
how
my
heart
throbs
to
your
presence
as
to
that
of
no
other
living
woman
she
hushed
my
impetuous
words
with
the
gesture
of
a
queen
and
rose
to
her
feet
facing
me
under
the
stars
our
eyes
looked
into
each
other
and
her
face
was
very
white
you
must
not
she
said
firmly
and
i
thought
she
glanced
down
upon
the
motionless
figure
at
her
feet
i
have
trusted
you
do
not
cause
me
to
regret
it
i
bowed
humiliated
to
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
your
rebuke
is
perfectly
just
i
answered
slowly
god
knows
i
shall
never
be
guilty
again
you
will
have
faith
in
me
always
everywhere
whether
it
ever
be
our
fate
to
meet
again
or
not
but
now
you
must
go
and
leave
you
here
alone
are
you
not
afraid
afraid
she
looked
about
her
into
the
darkness
of
what
surely
you
do
not
mean
of
frank
of
major
brennan
and
as
to
my
being
alone
our
quarters
are
within
a
scant
hundred
yards
from
here
and
a
single
cry
will
bring
me
aid
in
plenty
hush
what
was
that
it
was
the
shuffling
tread
of
many
feet
the
sturdy
tramp
of
a
body
of
infantry
on
the
march
go
she
cried
hurriedly
if
you
would
truly
serve
me
if
you
care
at
all
for
me
do
not
longer
delay
and
be
discovered
here
it
is
the
grand
rounds
i
beg
of
you
go
i
grasped
her
outstretched
hand
pressed
my
lips
hotly
upon
it
and
sped
with
noiseless
footsteps
down
the
black
deserted
road
chapter
xix
the
cavalry
outpost
i
lingered
merely
long
enough
to
feel
assured
as
to
her
safety
creeping
closer
until
i
heard
her
simple
story
of
the
major
fall
from
his
horse
and
then
watched
through
the
night
shadows
while
the
little
squad
bore
his
unconscious
form
over
the
crest
of
the
low
hill
toward
their
quarters
then
i
turned
my
face
eastward
and
tramped
resolutely
on
the
excitement
of
the
night
and
especially
the
sharp
fierce
struggle
with
brennan
had
reawakened
all
my
old
military
enthusiasm
and
i
felt
every
nerve
tingling
anew
as
i
breasted
the
long
slope
before
me
even
the
depression
naturally
resulting
from
my
unhappy
parting
with
edith
brennan
gave
way
for
the
time
being
to
this
sense
of
surrounding
danger
while
the
ardor
of
youth
responded
joyfully
to
the
spirit
of
adventure
i
simply
would
not
think
of
what
i
had
lost
certainly
would
not
permit
its
memory
to
depress
me
i
was
first
of
all
a
soldier
and
nothing
short
of
death
or
capture
should
prevent
me
reaching
lee
with
my
message
let
what
would
happen
all
else
could
wait
the
gleam
of
the
stars
fell
upon
the
double
row
of
buttons
down
the
breast
of
the
coat
i
wore
and
i
stopped
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
nothing
could
be
gained
by
longer
masquerade
and
i
felt
inexpressible
shame
at
being
thus
attired
neither
pass
nor
uniform
would
suffice
to
get
me
safe
through
those
outer
picket
lines
and
if
i
should
fall
in
the
attempt
or
be
again
made
prisoner
i
vastly
preferred
meeting
my
fate
clad
in
the
faded
gray
of
my
own
regiment
with
odd
sense
of
relief
i
hastily
stripped
off
the
gorgeous
trappings
flung
them
in
the
ditch
beside
the
road
and
pressed
on
feeling
like
a
new
man
there
was
small
need
for
caution
here
and
for
more
than
an
hour
i
tramped
steadily
along
never
meeting
a
person
or
being
startled
by
a
suspicious
sound
then
as
i
rounded
a
low
eminence
i
perceived
before
me
the
dark
outline
of
trees
which
marked
the
course
of
the
white
briar
while
directly
in
my
front
and
half
obscured
by
thick
leaves
of
the
underbrush
blazed
the
red
glare
of
a
fire
i
knew
the
stream
well
its
steep
banks
of
precipitate
rock
its
rapid
swirling
current
which
i
was
well
aware
i
was
not
a
sufficiently
expert
swimmer
to
cross
once
upon
the
other
bank
i
should
be
comparatively
safe
but
to
pass
that
picket
post
and
attain
the
ford
was
certain
to
require
all
the
good
fortune
i
could
ever
hope
for
but
despair
was
never
for
long
my
comrade
and
i
had
learned
how
determination
opens
doors
to
the
courageous
it
is
ever
he
who
tries
that
enters
in
it
took
me
ten
minutes
possibly
creeping
much
of
the
way
like
a
wild
animal
over
the
rocks
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
had
attained
a
position
well
within
the
dense
thicket
and
could
observe
clearly
the
ground
before
me
and
some
of
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
as
i
supposed
it
was
a
cavalry
outpost
i
could
distinguish
the
crossed
sabres
on
the
caps
of
the
men
although
it
was
some
time
before
i
was
able
to
determine
positively
where
their
horses
were
picketed
there
must
have
been
all
of
twenty
in
the
party
and
i
could
distinguish
the
lieutenant
in
command
a
man
with
chin
beard
seated
by
himself
against
the
wall
of
a
small
shanty
of
logs
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
an
open
book
upon
his
knee
his
men
were
gathered
close
about
the
blazing
fire
for
the
night
air
was
decidedly
chill
as
it
swept
down
the
valley
a
number
were
sleeping
a
few
at
cards
while
a
little
group
sitting
with
their
backs
toward
me
yet
almost
within
reach
of
my
hand
were
idly
smoking
and
discussing
the
floating
rumors
of
the
camp
i
managed
to
make
out
dimly
the
figure
of
a
man
on
horseback
beyond
the
range
of
flame
and
apparently
upon
the
very
bank
of
the
stream
when
some
words
spoken
by
an
old
sergeant
interested
me
bob
he
said
to
the
soldier
lounging
next
him
whut
wus
it
thet
staff
officer
sed
ter
ther
leftenant
i
did
just
git
ther
straight
of
the
man
a
debonair
young
fellow
stroked
his
little
black
moustache
reflectively
ther
cove
sed
as
how
cole
division
wud
be
along
here
afore
daylight
an
thet
our
fellers
wud
likely
be
sent
out
ahead
of
whar

agoin
the
leftenant
asked
him
an
the
cove
sed
as
it
wus
a
gineral
advance
to
meet
ol
hancock
at
thet
good
lads
chimed
in
the
sergeant
slapping
his
knee
it
means
a
dance
down
the
valley
after
early
i
a
guessin
we
have
a
ol
fight
three
days
pervidin
allers
thet
ther
johnnies
do
skedaddle
fust
commented
another
tartly
whut
in
thunder
is
ther
matter
with
them
hosses
he
asked
suddenly
rising
and
peering
over
into
the
bushes
beyond
the
hut
where
a
noise
of
squealing
and
kicking
had
arisen
oh
the
bay
filly
is
probably
over
the
rope
agin
returned
the
sergeant
lazily
sit
down
sims
an
be
easy

i
know
thet
growled
the
soldier
doubtfully
but
thet
thar
kid

no
good
an
i
do
want
my
hoss
all
banged
up
jist
as

rope
ruins
more
hosses
than

rebs
this
gave
me
inspiration
and
before
the
speaker
sullen
growl
had
wholly
ceased
i
was
again
upon
hands
and
knees
silently
groping
my
way
along
the
bank
toward
the
rear
of
the
hut
it
proved
to
be
a
tiny
structure
containing
but
a
single
room
probably
a
mere
shack
without
windows
but
possessing
a
door
at
either
end
meeting
no
opposition
i
crept
within
where
i
felt
somewhat
safer
from
observation
and
then
peered
warily
forth
into
the
darkness
extending
between
it
and
the
river
the
stretched
from
one
corner
of
the
hut
where
it
seemed
to
be
secured
around
the
end
of
a
projecting
log
out
into
the
night
evidently
finding
its
other
terminus
at
a
big
tree
whose
spreading
top
i
could
dimly
perceive
shadowed
against
the
sky
along
it
were
tethered
the
horses
a
few
impatiently
champing
their
bits
and
pounding
with
their
hoofs
on
the
trampled
ground
but
the
majority
resting
quietly
their
heads
hanging
sleepily
down
the
one
nearest
me
appeared
a
finely
proportioned
animal
of
a
dark
color
and
was
equipped
with
both
saddle
and
bridle
of
the
soldier
in
charge
i
could
distinguish
nothing
doubtless
he
was
lounging
on
his
back
half
asleep
upon
some
soft
patch
of
grass
my
plan
was
conceived
instantly
it
was
a
desperate
one
yet
it
alone
seemed
in
the
least
feasible
if
by
chance
it
succeeded
it
would
place
me
in
saddle
once
more
and
to
a
cavalryman
that
means
everything
while
if
it
failed
ah
well
it
was
merely
a
of
the
coin
i
turned
impatient
for
the
trial
when
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
the
deserted
hut
might
contain
something
i
could
use
to
advantage
a
firearm
perhaps
or
even
a
stray
box
of
matches
i
felt
about
me
cautiously
creeping
along
the
hard
earthen
floor
until
i
had
nearly
reached
the
opposite
entrance
the
light
from
the
fire
without
leaped
up
and
its
glow
revealed
a
saddle
with
leather
holster
attached
hanging
to
a
nail
just
within
the
doorway
moving
noiselessly
i
managed
to
extract
a
revolver
but
could
discover
no
cartridges
i
was
yet
fumbling
in
the
holster
pocket
when
the
lieutenant
rose
from
his
seat
without
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
yawned
sleepily
standing
directly
between
me
and
the
fire
and
then
turning
sharply
walked
slowly
into
the
open
door
of
the
hut
i
sprang
to
my
feet
or
he
would
certainly
have
stepped
upon
me
and
before
he
could
realize
the
situation
i
had
him
by
the
collar
with
the
cold
muzzle
of
my
stolen
revolver
pressed
hard
against
his
cheek
a
single
word
or
sound
and
i
fire
i
said
sternly
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
seeing
any
man
more
completely
astounded
he
gasped
like
a
fish
newly
landed
and
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
made
utterance
even
had
he
dared
come
in
a
little
farther
i
commanded
now
look
here
lieutenant
you
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
and
you
will
get
out
of
this
affair
with
a
whole
skin
otherwise
well
i
playing
this
game
to
the
who
in
hell
are
you
he
gasped
finally
recovering
some
slight
power
of
expression
never
mind
friend
i
am
simply
a
man
with
a
gun
at
your
head
and
sufficiently
desperate
to
use
it
if
necessary
that
enough
for
you
to
know
and
reflect
over
now
answer
me
how
many
men
have
you
mounted
this
side
the
ford
he
glared
at
me
sullenly
and
i
drew
back
the
hammer
with
an
ominous
click
eying
him
fiercely
well
i
said
shortly
do
you
choose
to
answer
or
die
on
the
other
bank
standing
thus
covering
him
with
the
gun
and
marking
his
slightest
movement
i
thought
quickly
years
of
danger
teach
concentrated
thought
prompt
decision
and
i
soon
chose
my
course
to
kill
in
battle
is
soldierly
but
if
possible
to
avoid
it
there
should
be
no
killing
here
lieutenant
i
said
speaking
low
but
in
a
tone
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
my
exact
meaning
i
am
an
escaped
prisoner
and
shall
not
hesitate
to
kill
rather
than
be
recaptured
it
is
your
life
or
mine
and
i
naturally
prefer
my
own
but
i
give
you
one
chance
and
only
one
obey
my
orders
and
i
will
leave
you
here
unhurt
disobey
and
your
life
is
not
worth
the
snap
of
a
finger
move
back
now
until
you
face
the
door
and
do
forget
my
pistol
is
within
an
inch
of
your
ear
and
this
is
a
hair
trigger
what
is
your
sergeant
name
order
him
to
take
ten
men
on
foot
one
hundred
yards
west
on
the
pike
and
wait
further
the
lieutenant
twisted
his
head
about
and
looked
at
me
his
eyes
stubborn
with
anger
if
you
have
a
wife
up
north
and
care
anything
about
seeing
her
again
i
said
coolly
you
will
do
exactly
as
i
handley
he
called
out
his
voice
so
choked
with
rage
as
to
make
me
fearful
it
might
arouse
suspicion
take
ten
men
on
foot
to
the
and
wait
there
until
you
hear
from
i
could
plainly
note
the
dark
shadows
of
the
fellows
as
they
filed
out
past
the
fire
but
i
never
ventured
to
take
eye
or
gun
off
the
man
i
watched
how
many
remain
there
now
any
among
them
a
have
him
take
them
all
south
on
the
the
man
squirmed
like
an
eel
and
i
was
soldier
enough
to
sympathize
with
him
yet
every
time
he
turned
his
head
he
looked
death
squarely
in
the
face
and
i
doubt
not
thought
of
some
one
he
loved
in
that
distant
north
i
clicked
the
hammer
suggestively
come
friend
i
said
meaningly
time
jones
he
called
out
huskily
yes
sir
take
what
men
you
have
left
a
hundred
yards
south
on
the
we
could
hear
them
crunching
their
way
through
the
bushes
until
the
sound
finally
died
out
in
the
distance
now
lieutenant
you
come
with
me
softly
and
keep
your
we
moved
back
slowly
step
by
step
until
we
came
to
the
rear
door
of
the
shed
i
reached
out
into
the
darkness
but
without
turning
my
face
away
from
him
and
silently
severed
the
retaining
the
loosened
end
in
my
grasp
it
was
so
intensely
dark
where
we
stood
that
i
slipped
the
pistol
unobserved
into
my
belt
face
to
the
rear
i
said
sternly
as
he
turned
to
obey
this
order
with
quick
movement
i
tripped
him
sprang
backward
and
shut
the
door
in
a
single
bound
i
was
upon
the
back
of
the
black
and
had
flung
the
severed
rope
end
at
the
flank
of
the
next
horse
in
line
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
a
sharp
snapping
of
cords
a
wild
scurrying
through
the
bushes
as
twenty
frightened
horses
stampeded
up
the
bank
and
then
lying
face
down
over
the
saddle
pommel
i
sent
the
startled
black
crashing
down
into
the
shallows
of
the
ford
the
fellow
on
guard
tried
his
best
to
stop
us
but
we
were
past
him
like
the
wind
he
did
not
fire
and
doubtless
in
the
darkness
saw
merely
a
stray
horse
broken
from
the
the
other
fellow
took
one
swift
shot
but
it
went
wild
and
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
enraged
lieutenant
damning
in
the
distance
then
with
a
rush
we
went
up
the
steep
bank
on
the
eastern
shore
and
i
sat
upright
in
the
saddle
and
gave
the
black
his
rein
chapter
xx
a
demon
on
horseback
i
felt
positively
happy
then
the
thrill
of
successful
achievement
was
mine
and
with
the
exultation
of
a
soldier
in
having
surmounted
obstacles
and
peril
i
nearly
forgot
for
the
moment
the
heart
tragedy
left
behind
the
swift
impetus
of
the
ride
the
keen
night
air
sweeping
past
me
the
fresh
sense
of
freedom
and
power
engendered
by
that
reckless
dash
through
the
darkness
all
conspired
to
render
me
neglectful
of
everything
save
the
joy
of
present
victory
the
spirit
of
wild
adventure
was
in
my
blood
a
dozen
spits
of
fire
cleaved
the
intense
blackness
behind
and
i
knew
the
widely
scattered
patrol
were
sending
chance
shots
across
the
stream
a
clang
of
hoofs
rang
out
upon
the
rocks
but
i
could
distinguish
nothing
indicating
a
large
pursuing
party
probably
the
two
who
were
mounted
at
the
ford
with
possibly
others
following
when
they
caught
their
strayed
horses
i
had
little
to
fear
from
such
pursuit
as
this
was
sure
to
be
the
swift
powerful
stride
of
the
animal
i
rode
assured
me
that
i
was
not
ill
mounted
and
there
was
small
chance
of
contact
with
federal
outriders
before
i
should
reach
the
protecting
picket
lines
of
our
own
army
i
laughed
grimly
as
i
leaned
slightly
back
in
saddle
and
listened
it
was
like
a
play
so
swift
and
exciting
had
been
the
passing
events
so
unexpected
their
ending
i
wondered
what
plausible
story
the
discomfited
lieutenant
would
concoct
to
account
for
his
predicament
and
whether
the
others
had
yet
missed
me
back
at
the
mansion
house
the
stars
appeared
to
be
paling
somewhat
down
in
the
east
for
the
coming
was
already
whitening
the
horizon
i
glanced
at
my
watch
venturing
to
strike
a
match
for
the
purpose
and
found
the
hour
after
three
early
i
knew
was
at
sowder
church
and
his
advance
cavalry
pickets
ought
to
be
as
far
west
as
the
warrentown
road
the
distance
between
by
hard
riding
might
be
covered
in
three
hours
my
horse
seemed
fresh
his
breath
came
naturally
and
without
effort
and
i
pressed
him
along
rapidly
for
my
whole
ambition
now
centred
upon
bringing
the
information
i
possessed
within
our
own
lines
bungay
beyond
doubt
had
been
recaptured
long
since
for
my
own
experience
told
me
how
extremely
vigilant
were
the
federal
guards
to
one
unacquainted
as
he
was
with
military
customs
it
would
prove
impossible
to
penetrate
their
lines
hence
everything
must
depend
upon
my
getting
through
in
safety
then
my
thoughts
drifted
to
the
one
i
had
left
in
such
serious
predicament
if
i
had
loved
her
before
i
loved
her
doubly
now
for
she
had
proven
herself
a
woman
among
women
in
time
of
danger
and
trial
how
clearly
her
face
with
those
dark
sweet
eyes
and
the
wealth
of
crowning
hair
rose
before
me
while
word
by
word
i
reviewed
all
that
had
passed
between
us
dwelling
upon
each
look
or
accent
that
could
evince
her
possible
interest
in
me
then
reason
returned
to
my
aid
and
resolutely
determinedly
inspired
by
every
instinct
of
soldierly
honor
i
resolved
that
i
would
put
her
from
my
thoughts
for
ever
she
was
not
mine
either
to
love
or
possess
unless
the
uncertain
fate
of
war
should
chance
to
set
her
free
even
to
dream
of
her
to
cherish
her
in
memory
while
she
remained
the
wife
of
another
was
but
an
affront
to
her
purity
and
womanhood
i
would
prove
myself
a
man
entitled
to
her
respect
a
soldier
worthy
my
service
and
corps
if
ever
again
my
name
chanced
to
find
mention
in
her
presence
it
should
be
spoken
with
honor
i
was
musing
thus
lulled
by
the
steady
lope
of
my
horse
and
totally
insensible
to
any
possibility
of
peril
when
clear
upon
my
ears
instantly
awakening
me
from
such
reverie
there
rang
through
the
night
silence
the
sharp
clang
of
iron
on
the
road
behind
me
all
sound
of
pursuit
had
long
since
died
away
and
i
supposed
the
effort
to
recapture
me
had
been
abandoned
but
there
was
no
mistaking
now
at
least
one
horseman
riding
recklessly
through
the
black
night
was
pressing
hot
upon
my
trail
the
lieutenant
i
thought
the
lieutenant
burning
with
anger
at
the
trick
played
upon
him
has
pushed
far
ahead
of
his
troop
doubtless
mounted
upon
a
better
horse
determined
to
risk
everything
if
he
may
only
bring
me
back
dead
or
this
thought
awoke
me
in
an
instant
from
my
dreaming
and
i
spurred
my
horse
furiously
glancing
anxiously
backward
as
i
rode
but
unable
through
that
dense
gloom
to
distinguish
the
form
of
my
pursuer
yet
the
fellow
was
coming
coming
faster
than
any
speed
i
could
possibly
conjure
out
of
the
weary
black
i
bestrode
either
by
whip
or
spur
closer
and
closer
upon
me
came
rushing
down
that
pounding
of
iron
hoofs
on
the
hard
path
heavens
how
like
a
very
demon
the
man
rode
as
a
trooper
i
could
not
withhold
admiration
from
the
reckless
audacity
with
which
the
vengeful
fellow
bore
down
upon
me
in
spite
of
my
utmost
efforts
it
almost
seemed
as
if
we
were
standing
still
surely
nothing
less
than
hate
and
a
thirst
for
vengeance
bitter
as
death
implacable
as
fate
could
ride
like
that
through
the
black
night
on
the
track
of
a
hunted
man
i
was
able
to
trace
dimly
his
outlines
now
as
he
rose
on
an
eminence
in
my
rear
his
horse
looming
dark
against
the
sky
like
those
giant
steeds
that
snorted
fire
in
my
child
at
home
and
then
with
increasingly
loud
thunder
of
he
came
charging
straight
down
toward
me
in
sheer
desperation
i
glanced
on
either
side
seeking
some
avenue
of
escape
but
the
high
banks
were
unscalable
my
sole
remaining
hope
lay
in
a
shot
which
should
drop
that
crazed
brute
before
he
struck
and
crushed
me
riding
my
best
with
all
the
practised
skill
of
the
service
i
swung
my
body
sideways
bracing
myself
firmly
in
the
deep
saddle
and
took
steady
aim
the
hammer
came
down
with
a
dull
dead
click
the
revolver
was
chargeless
and
with
an
exclamation
of
baffled
rage
i
hurled
the
useless
weapon
full
at
the
advancing
brute
almost
at
the
instant
we
struck
my
horse
went
down
with
the
impetus
while
over
us
both
as
if
shot
from
a
cannon
plunged
our
pursuer
his
horse
turning
a
complete
somersault
the
rider
falling
so
close
that
i
was
upon
him
almost
as
soon
as
he
struck
the
ground
a
dip
of
the
flying
hoof
had
cut
a
shallow
gash
across
my
forehead
and
my
hair
was
wet
with
blood
yet
bruised
and
half
stunned
as
i
was
from
the
hard
fall
my
sole
longing
was
to
reach
and
throttle
that
madman
who
had
ridden
me
down
in
such
demon
style
you
unchained
devil
i
cried
savagely
whirling
him
over
upon
his
back
i
spared
your
life
once
but
by
all
the
gods
i
not
do
it
again
gosh
cap
is
thet
you
asked
the
voice
of
the
other
feebly
i
started
back
and
lost
my
hold
upon
him
bungay
in
an
astonishment
that
nearly
robbed
me
of
utterance
good
god
man
is
this
really
you
it
whut
left
o
me
he
answered
solemnly
sitting
up
and
feeling
his
head
as
if
expecting
to
find
it
gone
thet
wus
ther
worst
ride
ever
i
i
should
think
it
likely
i
exclaimed
my
anger
rising
again
as
i
thought
of
it
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
by
riding
down
on
me
like
that
holy
gee
cap
he
explained
penitently

ever
did
it

when
he
said
turf
the
flying
courser
spurn
you

en
jed
rubbed
his
cheek
as
if
it
stung
him
and
i
looked
at
him
in
the
faint
dawning
light
of
day
and
laughed
his
peaked
head
and
weazen
face
looked
piteous
enough
decorated
as
they
were
with
the
black
loam
through
which
he
had
ploughed
his
coat
was
ripped
from
tail
to
collar
while
one
of
his
eyes
was
nearly
closed
where
the
bruised
flesh
had
puffed
up
over
it
is
a
fearful
strife

the

browsing
by
the

apparently
little
the
worse
for
the
shock
although
a
thin
line
of
blood
trickled
slowly
down
her
flank

the
big

had
not
been
so
fortunate

lay

under

in

at
the
motionless

recited
solemnly

as

positively
refused

mounted
again

trudging
along
manfully
beside

of

captain
i
say
you
must
turn
out
of
i
opened
my
eyes
with
a
struggle
and
looked
up
the
golden
glow
of
sunlight
along
the
white
wall
told
me
the
day
must
be
already
well
advanced
and
i
saw
the
lieutenant
of
my

colgate
bending
over
me
attired
in
service
uniform
what
is
it
jack
we
have
been
ordered
north
on
forced
march
to
join
early
and
the
command
has
already
started
i
have
delayed
calling
you
until
the
final
moment
but
knew
you
would
never
forgive
being
left
before
he
had
finished
i
was
upon
the
floor
dressing
with
that
rapidity
acquired
by
years
of
practice
my
mind
thoroughly
aroused
to
the
thought
of
active
service
once
more
was
it
the
news
i
brought
in
yesterday
colgate
which
has
stirred
this
up
i
questioned
hastily
dipping
into
a
basin
of
water
i
imagine
it
must
have
been
sir
replied
the
lieutenant
leaning
back
comfortably
upon
a
which
formed
our
solitary
chair
things
have
been
on
the
move
ever
since
and
it
certainly
resembles
an
advance
of
some
importance

when
he
brought
the
orders

usually

yes
i

i
said
drawing
on
the
last
of
my
equipments
and
quickly
glancing
about
to
assure
myself
i
had
overlooked
nothing
likely
to
be
of
value
all
ready
jack
and
now
for
another
of
death
our
regiment
was
drawn
up
in
the
square
of
the
little
town
and
as
we
came
forth
into
the
glorious
sunlight
the
stentorian
voice
of
the
colonel
called
them
into
column
of
fours
staff
officers
gray
with
dust
from
their
service
were
riding
madly
along
the
curb
while
at
the
rear
of
our
men
just
debouching
from
one
of
the
side
streets
appeared
the
solid
front
of
a
division
of
infantry
we
had
barely
time
to
swing
into
the
saddles
of
the
two
horses
awaiting
us
and
ride
swiftly
to
the
head
of
our
command
when
the
short
stern
orders
rolled
along
the
motionless
line
of
troopers
and
the
long
silent
column
swung
out
to
the
northward
the
feet
of
the
horses
raising
a
thick
cloud
of
red
dust
which
fairly
enveloped
us
in
its
choking
folds
with
the
ardor
of
young
manhood
i
looked
forward
to
the
coming
battle
when
i
knew
the
mighty
armies
of
north
and
south
would
once
again
contest
for
the
fertile
shenandoah
it
was
to
be
american
pitted
against
american
a
struggle
ever
worthy
of
the
gods
slowly
i
rode
back
down
the
files
of
my
men
marking
their
alignment
and
accoutrements
with
practised
eye
smiling
grimly
as
i
noted
their
eager
faces
and
bronzed
by
exposure
yet
reanimated
by
hope
of
active
service
boys
half
of
them
appeared
to
be
yet
i
knew
them
as
veterans
of
many
fields
lads
who
would
die
without
a
murmur
beneath
their
beloved
southern
flag
as
undaunted
in
hour
of
peril
as
were
the
old
guard
at
waterloo
in
spite
of
frayed
and
ragged
uniforms
tarnished
battered
facings
dingy
flapping
hats
they
looked
stanch
and
true
soldiers
every
inch
of
them
and
i
marked
with
the
jealous
pride
of
command
their
evenly
closed
ranks
and
upright
carriage
how
like
some
giant
machine
they
moved
horses
and
men
in
trained
and
disciplined
power
as
i
watched
them
thus
i
thought
again
of
those
many
other
faces
who
once
rode
as
these
men
did
now
but
who
had
died
for
duty
even
as
these
also
might
yet
be
called
upon
to
die
one
hundred
and
three
strong
gay
in
bright
new
uniforms
with
unstained
banner
kissing
the
breeze
above
our
proud
young
heads
we
rode
hopefully
forth
from
charlottesville
scarce
three
years
before
untried
undisciplined
unknown
to
place
our
lives
willingly
upon
the
sacred
altar
of
our
native
state
what
speechless
years
of
horror
those
had
been
what
history
we
had
written
with
our
naked
steel
what
scenes
of
suffering
and
death
lay
along
that
bloody
path
we
travelled
down
the
same
red
road
our
eyes
still
set
grimly
to
the
northward
our
flag
a
torn
and
ragged
remnant
barely
forty
men
wore
the
d
between
the
crossed
sabres
on
their
slouched
brown
hats
in
spite
of
all
recruiting
the
cheer
in
my
heart
was
for
the
living
the
tear
in
my
eye
was
for
the
dead
colgate
i
said
gravely
as
i
ranged
up
beside
him
at
the
rear
of
the
troop
the
men
look
exceedingly
well
and
do
not
appear
to
have
suffered
greatly
because
of
short
oh
the
lads
are
always
in
fine
fettle
when
they
expect
a
fight
he
answered
his
own
eyes
dancing
as
he
swept
them
over
that
straight
line
of
backs
in
his
front
they
scrap
the
better
for
being
a
bit
hungry
it
makes
them
savage
beats
all
captain
what
foolish
notions
some
of
those
people
on
the
other
side
have
of
us
southerners
they
seem
to
think
we
are
entirely
different
from
themselves
yet
i
reckon
it
would
puzzle
any
recruiting
officer
up
yonder
to
show
a
finer
lot
of
fighting
men
than
those
fellows
ahead
there
for
powder
why
there
is
a
lad
among
them
unfit
for
in
spite
of
the
indignation
in
his
tone
his
voice
had
the
lazy
southern
drawl
and
somehow
as
he
spoke
i
thought
of
my
fair
prisoner
in
the
mountains
and
of
how
disdainfully
she
treated
me
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
meeting
i
sincerely
hoped
her
conception
of
the
southerner
had
received
partial
revision
since
well
yes
i
answered
thoughtfully
doubtless
those
who
have
never
visited
the
south
and
who
form
their
conception
of
us
from
northern
newspapers
and
abolition
orators
get
hold
of
our
worst
characteristics
and
judge
accordingly
i
sometimes
feel
that
the
whole
trouble
between
the
sections
is
merely
such
a
misunderstanding
on
a
large
scale
and
that
had
we
only
intermingled
more
freely
many
of
our
differences
would
have
disappeared
in
this
we
are
fully
as
wrong
as
those
of
the
other
side
narrowness
of
thought
and
life
has
been
the
secret
force
behind
this
war
partisans
upon
both
sides
have
ignored
the
fact
that
we
are
all
of
one
blood
and
one
history
but
in
this
respect
the
tendency
of
the
conflict
has
been
to
broaden
out
the
actual
participants
and
teach
them
mutual
respect
i
imagine
women
are
at
present
more
apt
to
retain
this
prejudice
women
whose
loved
ones
are
in
arms
against
i
was
thinking
about
a
woman
when
i
spoke
he
explained
gravely
she
was
certainly
a
beauty
and
nursed
me
in
the
hospital
at
baltimore
oh
you
need
smile
she
was
married
her
husband
was
on
staff
i
saw
him
once
a
big
fellow
with
a
black
moustache
of
course
we
all
looked
alike
lying
there
in
those
cots
and
she
very
naturally
supposed
i
was
one
of
their
wounded
until
after
the
fever
left
me
and
i
became
able
to
converse
a
bit
and
then
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
expression
in
her
eyes
when
i
confessed
the
truth
actually
she
cried
out
a
rebel
and
gazed
at
me
as
if
i
had
been
some
dangerous
wild
animal
truly
i
believe
she
nearly
looked
upon
herself
as
a
traitress
because
she
had
nursed
me
and
saved
my
life
yet
she
was
wonderfully
and
kind
you
see
she
was
a
regular
army
nurse
and
i
was
probably
the
first
confederate
soldier
she
had
ever
come
in
close
contact
did
you
become
friends
most
certainly
at
least
in
a
way
for
she
undertook
my
conversion
frankly
if
it
had
been
for
that
inconvenient
husband
in
the
path
i
am
not
so
certain
you
would
have
lost
a
lieutenant
the
fact
that
the
lady
was
already
brennan
alone
saved
mrs
brennan
although
the
disclosure
was
not
altogether
unexpected
i
could
not
help
echoing
the
name
certainly
in
sudden
surprise
and
glancing
aside
at
my
face
can
it
be
possible
that
you
know
her
not
more
than
twenty
i
should
say
with
great
clear
honest
eyes
and
a
perfect
wealth
of
hair
that
appears
auburn
in
the
i
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
her
once
or
twice
briefly
while
in
sheridan
lines
i
answered
hurriedly
and
have
reason
to
indorse
all
you
say
regarding
the
lady
especially
as
to
her
dislike
of
everything
clad
in
gray
uniform
but
the
men
appear
to
be
straggling
somewhat
lieutenant
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
brace
them
up
a
i
rode
slowly
forward
to
my
own
position
at
the
head
of
the
troop
wondering
at
the
strange
coincidence
which
had
placed
edith
name
upon
colgate
lips
her
memory
had
been
brought
back
to
me
with
renewed
freshness
by
his
chance
words
and
so
strongly
did
it
haunt
me
as
to
be
almost
a
visible
presence
as
i
swung
my
horse
into
our
accustomed
position
i
was
too
deeply
buried
in
reflection
to
be
clearly
conscious
of
much
that
was
occurring
about
me
suddenly
however
i
became
aware
that
some
one
nearly
obscured
by
the
enveloping
cloud
of
dust
was
riding
without
the
column
in
an
independence
of
military
discipline
not
to
be
permitted
in
the
state
of
mind
i
was
then
in
this
discovery
strangely
irritated
me
sergeant
i
questioned
sharply
of
the
trooper
at
the
end
of
the
first
platoon
what
fellow
is
that
riding
out
yonder
it
ther
pesky
little
cuss
as
come
in
with
ye
yesterday
sir
he
returned
with
a
grin
he
confiscated
a
muel
somewhar
an
says
he
a
goin
back
hum
o
we
curious
to
learn
how
jed
had
emerged
from
his
arduous
adventures
i
spurred
my
horse
alongside
of
him
the
little
man
bending
forward
dubiously
as
if
fearful
of
accident
was
riding
bareback
on
a
gaunt
mule
which
judging
from
all
outward
appearances
must
have
been
some
discarded
asset
of
the
quartermaster
department
the
animal
was
evidently
a
complete
wreck
and
drooped
along
dragging
one
foot
heavily
after
the
other
as
if
every
move
were
liable
to
be
the
last
his
head
hanging
dejectedly
while
his
long
ears
flopped
solemnly
over
the
eyes
at
each
step
altogether
the
two
composed
so
melancholy
a
picture
it
was
with
difficulty
i
suppressed
my
strong
inclination
to
laugh
going
home
jed
i
asked
as
he
glanced
up
and
saw
me
jist
as
durn
quick
as
i
kin
git
thar
he
returned
emphatically
by
gum
cap
i
ai
bin
from
mariar
long
as
this
afore
in
twelve
year
reckon
she
thinks
i
skedaddled
fer
good
this
time
an
be
a
takin
up
with
some
other
male
critter
lest
i
git
back
thar
mighty
sudden
women
odd
cap
durn
nigh
as
ornary
some
things
as
a
i
have
never
enjoyed
much
experience
with
them
i
said
but
i
confess
to
knowing
something
about
mules
now
that
seems
to
be
rather
an
extraordinary
specimen
you
are
he
eyed
his
mount
critically
burned
if
ever
i
thought
i
git
astraddle
o
any
critter
agin
he
said
rubbing
himself
as
if
in
sudden
and
painful
recollection
of
the
past
but
i
sorter
picked
up
this
yere
muel
down
et
ther
corral
an
he
tew
durn
wore
out
a
totin
things
fer
you
uns
ter
ever
move
offen

i
sorter
reckon
it
a
heap
easier
a
sittin
yere
than
ter
take
it
afut
all
ther
way
ter
ther
he
certainly
has
the
appearance
of
being
perfectly
safe
but
you
know
a
mule
is
always
full
of
oh
this
en
ai
confidently
why
he
so
durn
wore
out
a
things
thet
he
bin
plum
asleep
all
ther

it
true
thet
a

wake
up
an
git
a

on
itself
if
ye
blow
in
his
ear
who
told
you
that
the
feller
down

durn
well
ter

ahead
out
o
this
pesky
i
had
never
before
seen
such
an
experiment
tried
but
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
animal
involved
induced
me
to
rein
back
my
horse
and
to
that
precaution
i
have
no
doubt
i
owe
my
life
jed
blew
only
once
he
lacked
opportunity
to
do
more
for
a
shock
of
electricity
could
never
have
more
quickly
aroused
that
mule
his
long
ears
were
erected
with
a
snap
his
short
spike
tail
shot
out
straight
while
his
heels
cut
the
air
in
furious
semicircles
as
he
backed
viciously
i
heard
a
yell
from
jed
saw
him
clasp
his
arms
lovingly
about
the
animal
neck
caught
a
confused
glimpse
of
the
wildly
cavorting
figure
amid
the
red
dust
cloud
and
then
rear
on
and
lashing
out
crazily
that
juggernaut
of
a
mule
struck
the
unsuspecting
advancing
column
of
troopers
and
plunged
half
through
their
ranks
before
they
even
realized
what
had
happened
horses
plunged
wildly
to
escape
here
and
there
a
man
went
down
in
the
crush
oaths
blows
shouts
of
anger
rang
out
while
beneath
the
dense
dust
cloud
frightened
horses
and
startled
riders
struggled
fiercely
to
escape
for
the
moment
it
was
pandemonium
in
earnest
and
i
could
only
trace
the
disastrous
passage
of
bungay
by
the
shouts
of
angry
men
and
the
sharp
cries
of
injured
horses
captain
wayne
what
does
all
this
mean
sir
what
is
the
cause
of
the
disorder
in
your
troop
it
was
the
major
voice
stern
indignant
commanding
i
dashed
the
tears
of
laughter
from
my
eyes
and
strove
to
face
him
decorously

has
taken
a
fit
of
kicking

will
straighten
them
out

wheeled
and
peered
into
the
rolling
surging
mass
of
dust
out
of
which
there
arose
such
a
hubbub
of
sounds
as
to
make
the
noise
of
battle
tame

hold
of
the

from

there

no

at
that
the
stern
words
of
command
the
return
of
discipline
seemed
to
steady
that
seething
fighting
mass
in
an
instant
there
was
a
squeal
a
curse
a
slight
settling
down
of
the
dust
cloud
and
two
perspiring
troopers
emerged
from
the
jam
dragging
the
yet
reluctant
mule
by
main
strength
behind
them
as
they
cleared
the
line
of
the
column
bungay
rolled
off
the
animal
back
and
in
his
eagerness
came
down
on
all
fours
well
i
said
sarcastically
what
do
you
think
of
your
mule
now
by

and
his
face
lit
up
with
intense
admiration
as
he
surveyed

curious
line
of
troopers
and
faced
him
angrily
what
do
you
mean
by
running
your
old
mule
into
this
column
he
thundered
who
are

the
wrath
on
the

caused
me
to
interfere
in
a
few
words
i
made
everything
clear
and
substantial
justice
was
attained
by
an
order
for
jed
to
move
on
with
his
animated
battering
ram
he
disappeared
dolefully
in
the
dust
cloud
the
mule
once
more
asleep
trailing
lazily
behind
him
the
troop
slightly
disfigured
closed
up
their
broken
ranks
and
the
weary
march
was
resumed
it
was
long
after
dark
the
second
day
when
thoroughly
wearied
we
turned
into
an
old
tobacco
field
and
made
camp
for
the
night
to
right
and
left
of
our
position
glowed
the
cheery
fires
telling
where
command
bivouacked
in
line
of
battle
from
the
low
range
of
hills
in
front
of
where
we
rested
one
could
look
across
an
intervening
valley
and
see
far
off
to
the
northward
the
dim
flames
which
marked
the
position
of
the
enemy
down
in
the
mysterious
darkness
between
divided
only
by
a
swift
and
narrow
stream
were
the
blue
and
gray
pickets
the
opposing
forces
were
sleeping
on
their
arms
making
ready
for
the
death
grip
on
the
morrow
as
i
lay
there
thinking
wondering
what
might
be
my
fate
before
another
nightfall
seeing
constantly
in
my
the
fair
face
of
a
woman
which
made
me
more
of
a
coward
than
i
had
ever
felt
myself
before
i
was
partially
aroused
by
the
droning
tones
of
a
voice
close
at
hand
lifting
myself
on
one
elbow
i
glanced
curiously
around
to
see
where
it
originated
what
was
occurring
clustered
about
a
roaring
fire
of
rails
were
a
dozen
troopers
and
in
the
midst
of
them
occupying
the
post
of
honor
upon
an
empty
powder
keg
was
bungay
enthusiastically
reciting
scott
i
caught
a
line
or
two
once
there
rose
so
wild
a
yell
within
that
dark
and
narrow
dell
as
all
the
fiends
from
heaven
that
fell
had
pealed
the
of
hell
and
then
the
drowsy
god
pressed
down
my
heavy
eyelids
and
i
fell
asleep
chapter
xxii
the
battle
in
the
shenandoah
to
me
it
has
always
seemed
remarkable
that
after
all
my
other
battle
experiences
antietam
gettysburg
the
wilderness
ay
even
including
that
first
fierce
baptism
of
fire
at
manassas
no
action
in
which
i
ever
participated
should
remain
so
clearly
photographed
upon
memory
as
this
last
desperate
struggle
for
supremacy
in
the
shenandoah
every
minute
detail
of
the
conflict
at
least
so
far
as
i
chanced
to
be
a
personal
participant
rises
before
me
as
i
write
and
i
doubt
not
i
could
trace
each
step
taken
upon
that
stricken
field
the
reveille
had
not
sounded
when
i
first
awoke
and
rolling
from
my
blanket
looked
about
me
already
a
faint
dim
line
of
gray
heralding
the
dawn
was
growing
clearly
defined
in
the
east
and
making
manifest
those
heavy
which
hanging
dank
and
low
obscured
the
valley
the
tired
men
of
my
troop
were
yet
lying
upon
the
ground
wrapped
tightly
in
their
blankets
oblivious
of
the
deadly
work
before
them
but
i
could
hear
the
horses
already
moving
uneasily
at
their
and
observed
here
and
there
the
chilled
figure
of
a
sentry
leaning
upon
his
gun
oddly
distorted
in
form
by
the
enveloping
mist
directly
in
advance
of
where
we
rested
a
long
hill
sloped
gently
upward
for
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
its
crest
topped
with
a
thick
growth
of
young
yet
seemingly
devoid
of
underbrush
no
troops
were
camped
in
our
immediate
front
and
feeling
curious
to
ascertain
something
of
our
formation
as
well
as
to
examine
the
lay
of
the
land
between
us
and
the
position
occupied
by
the
enemy
i
walked
slowly
forward
unhindered
until
i
attained
the
crest
numberless
birds
were
singing
amid
the
branches
overhead
while
the
leaves
of
the
low
bushes
i
passed
on
my
way
were
glistening
with
dew
except
for
those
long
rows
of
sleeping
soldiers
i
seemed
utterly
alone
within
some
rural
solitude
upon
a
quiet
sabbath
morning
not
an
unwonted
sound
reached
me
to
make
discord
so
quiet
indeed
was
all
the
earth
that
i
became
startled
by
the
sudden
chatter
of
a
squirrel
disturbed
at
my
approach
and
unthinkingly
i
stooped
to
pluck
a
delicate
pink
flower
blooming
in
the
grass
and
placed
it
in
a
ragged
buttonhole
of
my
old
gray
jacket
the
fog
yet
held
the
secrets
of
the
valley
safely
locked
within
its
brown
hand
and
i
could
penetrate
none
of
its
mysteries
it
was
like
gazing
down
from
some
headland
into
a
silent
unvexed
sea
but
directly
across
from
where
i
stood
apparently
along
the
summit
of
another
chain
of
low
hills
similar
to
those
we
occupied
i
could
perceive
the
flames
of
numerous
leaping
up
into
sudden
radiance
while
against
the
brightening
sky
a
great
flag
lazily
flapped
its
folds
to
the
freshening
breeze
evidently
our
opponents
were
first
astir
and
the
headquarters
of
some
division
of
the
enemy
must
be
across
yonder
as
i
gazed
other
fires
burst
forth
to
left
and
right
as
far
as
the
unaided
eye
could
carry
through
the
gloom
and
i
was
thus
enabled
to
trace
distinctly
those
advanced
lines
opposing
us
experience
told
me
their
position
must
be
a
strong
one
and
their
force
heavy
as
i
turned
to
mark
our
own
formation
the
roll
of
drums
rang
out
while
the
quickening
notes
of
the
reveille
sounded
down
the
long
lines
of
slumbering
men
life
returned
as
if
by
magic
to
those
motionless
forms
and
almost
in
a
moment
all
below
me
became
astir
and
i
could
clearly
distinguish
the
various
branches
of
the
service
as
they
stretched
away
commingled
upon
either
hand
we
were
evidently
stationed
close
to
the
centre
of
our
own
position
our
was
not
so
extended
as
the
one
across
the
valley
apparently
there
were
fewer
troops
along
our
front
than
theirs
nor
could
i
perceive
to
the
southward
now
that
dawning
day
somewhat
clarified
the
scene
any
evidence
of
reserve
force
yet
what
i
saw
looked
extremely
well
and
my
heart
bounded
proudly
at
the
sturdy
promise
of
our
fighting
men
the
cavalry
appeared
to
be
principally
concentrated
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
i
stood
although
at
the
distant
wings
i
was
able
to
perceive
some
flying
guidons
that
told
me
of
the
presence
of
numerous
troops
of
horse
i
marked
it
all
with
eager
kindling
eyes
for
it
was
a
sight
to
cheer
the
heart
of
any
soldier
those
dark
dense
squares
where
the
infantry
were
massed
and
battery
after
battery
of
flying
artillery
ranged
along
the
ridge
but
it
seemed
to
me
the
larger
heavier
force
had
been
concentrated
upon
our
left
massed
there
in
deeper
lines
as
if
that
were
the
point
selected
from
whence
the
attacking
wedge
was
to
be
driven
the
intervening
ground
sloped
so
gently
forward
while
the
hill
crest
was
so
thickly
crowned
with
trees
it
looked
an
ideal
position
from
which
to
advance
in
line
of
attack
upon
my
right
there
appeared
a
break
in
the
solidity
of
our
line
but
even
as
i
noted
it
wondering
at
the
oversight
the
dense
front
of
an
infantry
column
debouched
from
a
ravine
and
marching
steadily
forward
filled
the
gap
i
could
distinctly
mark
the
wearied
manner
in
which
the
men
composing
it
flung
themselves
prostrate
on
the
hard
ground
the
moment
they
were
halted
doubtless
all
through
the
long
hours
of
the
black
night
they
had
been
toiling
on
to
be
in
time
aides
were
galloping
furiously
now
among
the
scattered
commands
the
obscuring
fog
slowly
rose
from
off
the
face
of
the
valley
but
all
the
central
portion
remained
veiled
from
view
suddenly
as
i
watched
the
brown
cloud
beneath
me
was
rent
asunder
here
and
there
by
little
spits
of
fire
and
it
was
curious
to
observe
how
those
quick
spiteful
darts
of
flame
swept
the
full
length
of
my
vista
i
could
distinguish
no
reports
it
was
too
far
away
but
realized
that
the
opposing
pickets
had
caught
sight
of
each
other
through
the
gloom
then
a
big
gun
boomed
almost
directly
opposite
me
its
flame
seeming
like
a
knife
rending
the
mist
this
had
barely
vanished
when
a
sudden
cheer
rang
out
upon
my
left
and
i
turned
in
time
to
behold
a
thin
scattered
line
of
infantrymen
swarm
down
the
steep
slope
into
the
valley
with
hats
drawn
low
and
guns
advanced
they
plunged
at
a
run
into
the
mist
and
disappeared
our
skirmishers
had
gone
in
the
ball
had
opened
i
had
tarried
long
enough
any
moment
now
might
bring
boots
and
saddles
and
if
i
possessed
the
slightest
desire
for
a
breakfast
to
fight
on
it
behooved
me
to
get
back
within
our
lines
the
memory
of
that
animated
scene
in
front
still
fresh
upon
me
how
quiet
and
commonplace
everything
appeared
down
there
in
the
hill
shadow
no
one
would
have
dreamed
it
to
be
a
the
fires
crackled
gayly
while
the
men
lounged
about
them
smoking
or
eating
there
was
no
sound
save
the
gentle
rustling
of
leaves
overhead
or
the
light
laughter
of
some
group
of
horses
munched
their
grain
just
at
our
rear
and
now
and
then
some
careful
trooper
sauntered
back
to
make
sure
his
mount
was
not
neglected
one
or
two
of
the
men
were
cleaning
their
revolvers
and
an
old
corporal
was
polishing
his
sabre
where
a
spot
of
rust
disfigured
its
gleaming
blade
you
might
have
dreamed
it
a
picnic
a
military
review
possibly
were
it
not
for
the
and
ragged
uniforms
but
a
line
held
there
for
the
stern
purpose
of
deadly
conflict
it
scarcely
seemed
credible
captain
said
a
lad
of
seventeen
as
i
sat
down
on
the
ground
to
my
coffee
and
corn
bread
did
you
see
anything
of
the
out
there
plenty
of
them
my
boy
i
answered
noting
the
curls
that
clustered
upon
his
forehead
and
wondering
what
mother
prayed
for
him
we
have
plenty
of
hot
work
cut
out
for
us
i
hope
they
give
us
a
charge
before
it
all
his
blue
eyes
danced
as
he
strode
off
whistling
gayly
what
has
become
of
bungay
i
questioned
of
colgate
who
was
lying
upon
his
back
with
eyes
fastened
on
a
floating
cloud
do
you
mean
the
little
mountaineer
who
came
in
with
us
last
night
i
nodded
oh
his
mule
bolted
at
the
first
shot
over
yonder
and
the
little
fellow
is
after
it
he
down
the
field
there
how
time
dragged
the
battery
to
left
of
us
went
into
action
and
began
firing
rapidly
we
could
mark
the
black
figures
of
the
cannoneers
at
the
nearer
guns
outlined
against
the
sky
over
the
crest
as
they
moved
quickly
back
and
forth
twice
they
bore
motionless
bodies
to
the
rear
and
laid
them
down
tenderly
beyond
the
fierce
zone
of
fire
then
the
heavier
pieces
of
artillery
farther
down
the
line
burst
into
thunder
and
we
silently
watched
a
large
force
of
infantry
move
slowly
past
us
up
the
long
slope
until
they
halted
in
line
of
battle
just
behind
its
summit
the
advanced
files
lying
flat
upon
their
faces
and
peering
over
but
no
orders
came
for
us
the
eagerly
expectant
men
moved
back
toward
their
picketed
horses
in
anticipation
of
a
hurried
call
but
as
the
minutes
slowly
passed
and
none
came
they
broke
into
little
groups
sitting
about
on
the
ground
seemingly
careless
as
to
the
dread
rumbling
in
front
and
the
continuous
zip
of
minié
bullets
through
the
trees
overhead
one
or
two
i
noticed
as
i
walked
about
were
writing
what
possibly
they
dreamed
might
be
final
words
of
love
to
dear
ones
far
away
one
more
careless
group
were
playing
poker
upon
an
outspread
blanket
while
a
grizzled
old
sergeant
a
man
had
drawn
forth
his
pocket
testament
and
was
reading
over
again
the
familiar
story
of
the
nazarene
the
sullen
boom
of
the
great
guns
deep
ominous
began
to
blend
with
the
sustained
rattle
of
musketry
telling
plainly
of
heavy
fighting
by
massed
infantry
the
smoke
clouds
obscuring
the
blue
sky
rolled
high
above
the
fringe
of
trees
the
lying
along
the
crest
at
our
front
swept
down
the
hill
out
of
our
sight
into
that
hail
of
death
below
but
we
seemed
to
be
forgotten
nearly
noon
by
the
red
sun
hiding
behind
the
drifting
powder
cloud
the
roar
of
ceaseless
contest
had
moved
westward
down
the
valley
when
an
aide
wheeled
his
smoking
horse
in
front
of
the
colonel
spoke
a
dozen
hasty
words
pointed
impetuously
to
the
left
and
dashed
off
down
the
line
the
men
leaped
to
their
feet
in
eager
expectancy
and
as
the
fall
in
fall
in
there
lads
echoed
joyously
from
lip
to
lip
the
kindling
eyes
and
rapid
movements
voiced
unmistakably
the
soldier
spirit
we
moved
westward
down
the
long
bare
slope
in
the
sunshine
through
a
deserted
desolate
fields
and
along
a
narrow
rocky
defile
leading
into
a
deep
ravine
every
step
of
our
horses
brought
us
closer
to
that
deep
roar
of
surging
battle
the
air
we
breathed
became
pungent
with
powder
smoke
and
once
or
twice
we
heard
the
deep
hurrah
of
the
north
the
wild
answering
yell
of
the
south
as
victory
rolled
from
flag
to
flag
streams
of
wearied
and
wounded
men
began
to
pass
us
and
or
haggard
and
silent
but
all
alike
seeking
the
rear
the
head
of
our
advancing
column
pushed
them
sternly
aside
the
troopers
chaffing
the
uninjured
without
mercy
but
tender
as
women
to
those
who
suffered
back
among
the
rocks
out
of
reach
from
plunging
shells
a
field
hospital
had
been
hastily
set
up
the
ground
was
already
thickly
strewn
with
bodies
while
surgeons
labored
above
them
in
blood
with
averted
stern
set
faces
paling
to
the
cries
of
agony
we
rode
past
more
eager
than
ever
to
strike
the
enemy
at
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
we
came
forth
into
the
broad
valley
and
halted
just
in
front
of
us
scarcely
a
distant
were
the
fighting
lines
partially
enveloped
in
dense
smoke
out
from
which
broke
patches
of
blue
or
gray
as
charge
succeeded
charge
or
the
wind
swept
aside
the
fog
of
battle
the
firing
was
one
continuous
crash
while
plunging
bullets
overreaching
their
mark
began
to
chug
into
our
own
ranks
dealing
death
impartially
to
horse
and
man
the
captain
of
the
troop
next
mine
wheeled
suddenly
a
look
of
surprise
upon
his
face
and
fell
backward
into
the
arms
of
one
of
his
men
with
an
intense
scream
of
agony
almost
human
the
horse
of
my
first
sergeant
reared
and
came
over
crushing
the
rider
before
he
could
loosen
foot
from
stirrup
the
rode
slowly
past
us
to
the
rear
his
face
deathly
white
one
arm
dripping
blood
dangling
helpless
at
his
side
this
was
the
hardest
work
of
war
that
silent
agony
which
tried
men
in
helpless
bondage
to
unyielding
discipline
i
glanced
anxiously
along
the
front
of
my
troop
but
they
required
no
word
from
me
with
tightly
set
lips
and
pale
stern
faces
they
held
their
line
steady
as
granite
closing
up
silently
the
ragged
gaps
torn
by
plunging
balls

i
sat
my

you
will
see
that
the
paper
i
gave
you
reaches
home
safe
if
i
fail
to
come
out
of
this
i
reached
over
and
gripped
his

it
will
be
the
first

shall
remember

answered
earnestly
but
we
may
have
it
easy
enough
after
all
it
seems
to
be

he
shook
his
head
gravely
no
he
said
pointing
forward
they
will
need
us
as
he
spoke
it
seemed
as
though
the
sharp
firing
upon
both
sides
suddenly
ceased
by
mutual
consent
the
terrible
roar
of
small
arms
which
had
mingled
with
the
continuous
thunder
of
great
guns
died
away
into
an
intermittent
rattling
of
musketry
and
as
the
heavy
smoke
slowly
drifted
upward
in
a
great
white
cloud
we
could
plainly
distinguish
the
advancing
federal
lines
three
ranks
deep
stretching
to
left
and
right
in
one
vast
impenetrable
blue
wall
sweeping
toward
us
upon
a
run
where
but
a
brief
moment
before
the
plain
appeared
deserted
it
was
now
fairly
alive
with
soldiery
the
sun
gleaming
on
fixed
bayonets
and
faces
aglow
with
the
ardor
of
surprise
some
one
had
blundered
the
thin
unsupported
line
of
gray
infantry
directly
in
our
front
closed
up
their
shattered
ranks
hastily
in
desperate
effort
to
stay
the
rush
we
could
see
them
jamming
their
muskets
for
volley
fire
and
then
with
clash
and
clatter
that
drowned
all
other
sounds
a
battery
of
six
black
guns
came
flying
madly
past
us
every
horse
on
the
run
lashed
into
frenzy
by
his
wild
rider
with
carriage
and
caisson
leaping
at
every
jump
the
cannoneers
clinging
to
their
seats
like
monkeys
they
dashed
recklessly
forward
swung
about
into
position
and
almost
before
the
muzzles
had
been
well
pointed
were
hurling
canister
into
that
blue
victorious
advance
how
those
gallant
fellows
worked
their
guns
leaping
into
air
at
each
discharge
their
movements
clockwork
tense
eager
expectant
every
hand
among
us
hard
gripped
on
sabre
hilt
we
waited
that
word
which
surely
could
not
be
delayed
while
from
end
to
end
down
the
full
length
of
our
straining
line
rang
out
the
yell
of
exultant
pride
steady
men
steady
there
lads
called
the
old
colonel
sternly
his
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
our
turn
will
torn
rent
shattered
bleeding
treading
upon
the
dead
and
mangled
in
rows
those
iron
men
in
blue
came
on
they
were
as
demons
laughing
at
death
no
rain
of
lead
no
hail
of
canister
no
certainty
of
destruction
could
check
now
the
fierce
impetus
of
that
forward
rush
god
knows
it
was
magnificent
the
supreme
effort
of
men
intoxicated
with
the
enthusiasm
of
war
even
where
we
were
we
could
see
and
feel
the
giant
power
in
those
grim
ranks
of
steel
the
tattered
flags
the
stern
set
faces
the
chorus
of
glory
glory
hallelujah
that
echoed
to
their
tread
those
men
meant
to
win
or
die
and
they
rolled
on
as
cromwell
ironsides
at
marston
moor
twice
they
staggered
when
the
mad
volleys
ploughed
ragged
red
lanes
through
them
but
only
to
rally
and
press
sternly
on
they
struck
that
crouching
gray
line
of
infantry
fairly
buried
it
within
their
dense
blue
folds
and
with
one
fierce
hurrah
of
triumph
closed
down
upon
the
guns
even
as
they
blotted
them
from
sight
an
aide
hatless
and
bleeding
his
horse
wounded
and
staggering
from
weakness
tore
down
toward
us
along
the
crest
a
hundred
feet
away
his
mount
fell
headlong
but
on
foot
and
dying
he
reached
our
front
colonel
carter
he
panted
pressing
one
hand
upon
his
breast
to
keep
back
the
welling
blood
charge
and
hold
that
battery
until
we
can
bring
infantry
to
your
no
man
among
us
doubted
the
full
meaning
of
it
were
to
save
the
army
the
very
horses
seemed
to
feel
a
sense
of
relief
hands
clinched
more
tightly
on
taut
reins
to
hold
them
in
check
under
the
old
battered
hats
the
eyes
of
the
troopers
gleamed
hungrily
virginians
and
the
old
colonel
voice
rang
like
a
clarion
down
the
breathless
line
there
is
where
you
die
follow
me
slowly
like
some
mighty
mountain
torrent
gaining
force
we
rode
forth
at
a
walk
each
trooper
lined
to
precision
of
review
yet
instinctively
taking
distance
for
halfway
down
the
slight
slope
our
line
broke
into
a
sharp
trot
then
as
the
thrilling
notes
of
the
charge
sounded
above
us
we
swept
forward
in
wild
impetuous
tumult
who
can
tell
the
story
of
those
seconds
that
so
swiftly
followed
surely
not
one
who
saw
but
the
vivid
flash
of
steel
the
agonized
faces
the
flame
of
belching
fire
i
recall
the
frenzied
leap
of
my
horse
as
we
struck
the
line
ere
it
could
form
into
square
the
blows
dealt
savagely
to
right
and
left
the
blaze
of
a
volley
scorching
our
faces
the
look
of
the
big
infantryman
i
rode
down
the
sudden
thrust
that
saved
me
from
a
levelled
gun
the
quick
swerving
of
our
horses
as
they
came
in
contact
with
the
cannon
the
shouts
of
rage
the
blows
the
screams
of
pain
the
white
face
of
colgate
as
he
reeled
and
fell
these
are
all
in
my
memory
blurred
commingled
indistinct
yet
distressful
as
any
nightmare
in
some
way
how
i
know
not
i
realized
that
we
had
hurled
them
back
shattered
them
by
our
first
fierce
blow
that
the
guns
were
once
again
ours
that
fifty
dismounted
troopers
were
tugging
desperately
at
their
wheels
then
that
dense
blue
mass
surged
forward
once
again
engulfed
us
in
its
deadly
folds
and
with
steel
and
bullet
sword
and
clubbed
musket
ploughed
through
our
broken
ranks
rending
us
in
twain
fairly
smothering
us
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
i
saw
the
old
colonel
plunge
into
the
ruck
beneath
the
horses
feet
the
major
riding
stone
dead
in
his
saddle
a
ghastly
red
stain
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
then
hunter
of
e
went
down
screaming
and
i
knew
i
was
the
senior
captain
left
about
me
scarce
a
hundred
men
battled
like
demons
for
their
lives
in
the
midst
of
the
guns
even
as
i
glanced
aside
at
them
shielding
my
head
with
uplifted
sabre
from
the
blows
rained
upon
me
the
flung
up
his
hand
and
grasped
his
saddle
pommel
to
keep
from
falling
out
of
his
opening
fingers
i
snatched
the
splintered
staff
lifted
it
high
up
until
the
rent
folds
of
the
old
flag
caught
the
dull
glow
of
the
sunlight
th
virginia
i
shouted
rally
on
the
colors
i
could
see
them
coming
all
that
was
left
of
them
fighting
their
way
through
the
press
cleaving
the
mass
with
their
blows
as
the
prow
of
a
ship
cuts
the
sea
with
one
vicious
jab
of
the
spur
i
led
them
a
thin
wedge
of
tempered
gray
steel
battering
gouging
rending
a
passage
into
that
solid
blue
wall
inch
by
inch

by

yard
by
yard
slashing
madly
with
our
broken
sabres
battling
as
men
crazed
with
lust
of
blood
our
very
horses
fighting
for
us
with
teeth
and
hoofs
we
ploughed
a
lane
of
death
through
a
dozen
files
then
the
vast
mass
closed
in
upon
us
rolled
completely
over
us
there
was
a
flash
a
vision
of
frenzied
faces
and
i
knew
no
more
chapter
xxiii
field
hospital
sixth
corps
my
head
ached
so
abominably
when
i
first
opened
my
eyes
that
i
was
compelled
to
close
them
again
merely
realizing
dimly
that
i
looked
up
at
something
white
above
me
which
appeared
to
sway
as
though
blown
gently
by
the
wind
my
groping
hand
the
only
one
i
appeared
able
to
move
told
me
i
was
lying
upon
a
with
soft
sheets
about
me
and
that
my
head
rested
upon
a
pillow
then
i
passed
once
more
into
unconsciousness
but
this
time
it
was
sleep
when
i
once
more
awakened
the
throbbing
pain
had
largely
left
my
hot
temples
and
i
saw
that
the
swaying
white
canopy
composed
the
roof
of
a
large
tent
upon
which
the
golden
sunlight
now
lay
in
checkered
masses
telling
me
the
canvas
had
been
erected
among
trees
a
faint
moan
caused
me
to
move
my
head
slightly
on
the
gratefully
soft
pillow
and
i
could
perceive
a
long
row
of
cots
exactly
similar
to
the
one
i
occupied
each
apparently
filled
stretching
away
toward
an
opening
that
looked
forth
into
the
open
air
a
man
was
moving
slowly
down
the
narrow
aisle
toward
me
stopping
here
and
there
to
bend
over
some
sufferer
with
medicine
or
a
cheery
word
he
wore
a
short
white
jacket
and
was
without
a
cap
his
head
of
heavy
red
hair
a
most
conspicuous
object
as
he
approached
i
endeavored
to
speak
but
for
the
moment
my
throat
refused
response
to
the
effort
then
i
managed
to
ask
feebly
where
am
i
the
blue
eyes
in
the
freckled
boyish
face
danced
and
he
laid
a
big
red
hand
gently
upon
my
forehead
field

he
said
with
a
strong
hibernian
accent
an
how

ye

it
johnny
better
than
some

i
managed
to
articulate
faintly
who

a
wan
of
us
knows
he
admitted
frankly
but
your
fellows
did
the
it
was
an
old
old
story
to
all
of
us
by
that
time
and
i
closed
my
eyes
wearily
content
to
ask
no
more
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
i
rested
there
motionless
although
awake
my
eyes
closed
to
keep
out
the
painful
glare
my
sad
thoughts
busied
with
memory
of
those
men
whom
i
had
seen
reel
and
fall
upon
that
stricken
field
we
had
battled
so
vainly
to
save
once
i
wondered
with
sudden
start
of
fear
if
i
had
lost
a
limb
if
i
was
to
be
crippled
for
life
the
one
thing
i
dreaded
above
all
else
feeling
feebly
beneath
my
i
tested
as
best
i
could
each
limb
all
were
apparently
intact
although
my
left
arm
seemed
useless
and
devoid
of
feeling
broken
no
doubt
and
i
heaved
a
sigh
of
genuine
relief
then
i
became
partially
aroused
to
my
surroundings
by
a
voice
speaking
from
the
cot
next
mine
you
lazy
irish
marine
it
cried
petulantly
that
beef
stew
was
to
have
been
given
me
an
hour
sure
sor
was
the
soothing
reply
it
was
to
be
given
yer
honor
till
two
well
it
all
of
three
on
me
sowl
that
first
voice
sounded
oddly
familiar
and
i
turned
my
face
that
way
but
was
unable
to
perceive
the
speaker
is
that
lieutenant
caton
i
asked
doubtfully
most
assuredly
it
is
quickly
and
who
are
you
captain
wayne
of
the
confederate
oh
wayne
glad
you
spoke
but
extremely
sorry
to
have
you
here
badly
hurt
not
seriously
i
think
no
limbs
missing
anyhow
but
exceedingly
weak
where
did
they
get
you
in
the
side
a
musket
ball
but
extracted
i
would
be
all
right
if
that
lazy
irish
scamp
would
only
give
me
half
enough
to
eat
by
the
way
wayne
of
course
i
never
got
the
straight
of
it
for
there
are
stories
about
the
affair
flying
around
and
those
most
interested
will
not
talk
but
one
of
your
special
friends
and
to
my
notion
a
most
charming
young
woman
will
be
in
here
to
see
me
sometime
this
afternoon
she
will
be
delighted
to
meet
you
again
i
one
of
my
friends
i
questioned
incredulously
yet
instantly
thinking
of
edith
brennan
a
young
woman
sure
at
least
she
has
confessed
enough
to
me
regarding
that
night
work
to
make
me
strongly
suspicion
that
captain
wayne
of
the
confederate
army
and
colonel
curran
late
of
staff
are
one
and
the
same
person
a
mighty
neat
trick
by
jove
and
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
see
sheridan
face
when
they
told
him
but
about
the
young
lady
she
claims
great
friendship
with
the
gallant
colonel
of
light
artillery
and
her
description
of
his
appearance
at
the
ball
is
assuredly
a
masterpiece
of
romantic
fiction
come
captain
surely
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
to
forget
a
pretty
face
like
that
i
can
assure
you
you
made
a
deep
impression
there
are
times
when
i
am
almost
jealous
of
but
i
protested
my
heart
beating
rapidly
i
met
several
that
evening
and
you
have
mentioned
no
well
to
me
it
chances
there
is
but
one
worthy
of
mention
he
said
earnestly
and
that
one
is
celia
miss
minor
i
felt
a
strange
sense
of
disappointment
does
she
come
alone
most
certainly
do
you
suppose
she
would
expose
me
in
my
present
weak
state
to
the
fascinations
of
any
one
else
oh
so
the
wind
lies
in
that
quarter
does
it
old
fellow
i
congratulate
you
i
my
recollection
of
miss
minor
was
certainly
a
most
pleasant
one
and
i
recalled
to
memory
the
attractive
picture
of
her
glossy
black
hair
and
flashing
brown
eyes
yet
i
felt
exceedingly
small
interest
in
again
meeting
her
indeed
i
was
asleep
when
she
finally
entered
and
it
was
the
sound
of
caton
voice
that
aroused
me
and
made
me
conscious
of
the
presence
of
others
i
shall
share
these
grapes
with
my
over
yonder
he
said
laughingly
by
the
way
celia
his
voice
sounded
strangely
familiar
to
me
a
short
time
ago
just
glance
over
there
and
see
if
he
is
any
one
you
i
heard
the
soft
rustle
of
skirts
and
without
a
smile
looked
up
into
her
dark
eyes
there
was
a
sudden
start
of
pleased
surprise
why
she
exclaimed
eagerly
it
is
colonel
curran
edith
dear
here
is
the
rebel
who
pretended
to
be
myrtle
curran
how
the
hot
blood
leaped
within
my
veins
at
mention
of
that
name
but
before
i
could
lift
my
head
she
had
swept
across
the
narrow
aisle
and
was
standing
beside
me
wife
or
what
there
was
that
within
her
eyes
which
told
me
a
wondrous
story
for
the
instant
in
her
surprise
and
agitation
she
forgot
herself
and
lost
that
marvellous
which
had
held
us
so
far
apart
captain
wayne
she
cried
and
her
gloved
hands
fell
instantly
upon
my
own
where
it
rested
without
the
coverlet
you
here
and
wounded
i
smiled
up
at
her
feeling
now
that
my
injuries
were
indeed
trivial
somewhat
weakened
by
loss
of
blood
brennan
but
not
dangerously
then
i
could
not
forbear
asking
softly
is
it
possible
you
can
feel
regret
over
injuries
inflicted
upon
a
rebel
her
cheeks
flamed
and
the
audacious
words
served
to
recall
her
to
our
surroundings
even
although
i
love
my
country
and
sincerely
hope
for
the
downfall
of
her
enemies
she
answered
soberly
i
do
not
delight
in
suffering
were
you
in
that
terrible
cavalry
charge
they
tell
me
scarcely
a
man
among
them
i
rode
with
my
i
knew
it
was
your
regiment
the
name
was
upon
every
lip
and
even
our
own
men
unite
in
declaring
it
a
magnificent
sacrifice
a
most
gallant
deed
you
must
know
i
thought
instantly
of
you
when
i
was
told
it
was
the
act
of
the
th
there
were
tears
in
my
eyes
i
know
as
i
listened
to
her
and
my
heart
warmed
at
this
frank
confession
of
her
remembrance
i
am
glad
you
cared
sufficiently
for
me
i
said
gravely
to
hold
me
in
your
thought
at
such
a
time
our
command
merely
performed
the
work
given
it
but
the
necessity
has
cost
us
dearly
you
are
yet
at
general
sheridan
headquarters
only
temporarily
and
simply
because
there
has
been
no
opportunity
to
get
away
the
movements
of
the
army
have
been
so
hurried
and
uncertain
since
the
battle
miss
minor
has
desired
to
remain
until
assured
of
lieutenant
caton
permanent
recovery
he
was
most
severely
wounded
and
of
course
i
could
not
well
leave
her
here
alone
indeed
i
am
her
guest
as
we
depart
for
her
home
to
remain
but
miss
minor
is
i
understand
a
native
of
this
state
her
home
is
in
the
of
the
blue
ridge
along
the
valley
of
the
cowskin
a
most
delightful
old
southern
mansion
i
passed
one
summer
there
when
a
mere
girl
previous
to
the
but
will
it
prove
safe
for
you
now
oh
indeed
yes
everybody
says
so
it
is
entirely
out
of
the
track
of
both
armies
and
has
completely
escaped
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
main
combatants
but
rather
of
those
irregulars
who
will
be
most
certain
to
invade
promptly
any
section
not
patrolled
by
disciplined
troops
i
confess
to
fearing
greatly
that
there
will
be
an
early
outpouring
of
these
rascals
from
the
mountains
into
the
adjacent
lowlands
the
moment
we
are
compelled
to
fall
back
and
let
loose
the
iron
grip
with
which
we
have
held
them
thus
far
partially
in
check
yet
i
do
not
say
this
to
frighten
you
or
in
any
way
spoil
the
pleasure
of
your
contemplated
indeed
i
shall
not
permit
it
so
many
have
assured
me
it
would
be
perfectly
safe
that
i
do
not
mean
to
worry
i
expect
to
be
very
happy
there
until
the
war
is
over
surely
captain
wayne
it
can
not
long
continue
now
her
voice
was
low
earnest
almost
supplicating
it
looks
hopeless
even
from
our
standpoint
i
admit
i
returned
watching
the
straying
sunlight
play
amid
the
dusky
coils
of
her
hair
yet
we
are
not
likely
to
yield
until
we
but
you
captain
wayne
surely
you
have
already
risked
enough
i
presume
i
am
a
prisoner
i
answered
smiling
and
therefore
unable
at
present
to
choose
my
future
but
were
i
free
to
do
so
i
should
return
to
my
command
yet
surely
you
do
not
consider
that
this
terrible
rebellion
is
justified
is
right
i
think
there
is
undoubtedly
much
wrong
upon
both
sides
brennan
but
i
am
a
soldier
and
my
duty
is
very
simple
i
follow
my
flag
and
as
a
virginian
am
loyal
to
my
state
and
to
the
principles
taught
me
in
my
her
beautiful
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
as
she
bent
down
her
head
that
the
others
might
not
perceive
her
agitation
one
salty
drop
fell
upon
my
hand
it
is
all
so
very
very
sad
she
said
softly
there
is
much
suffering
upon
both
sides
but
surely
even
you
would
not
wish
me
to
be
other
than
true
to
what
i
look
upon
as
a
duty
no
i
i
think
i
i
respect
you
the
then
you
do
respect
me
another
word
a
far
stronger
one
trembled
upon
my
lips
yet
i
restrained
it
sternly
and
asked
all
i
dared
i
do
earnestly
her
eyes
dwelling
upon
my
face
i
may
not
comprehend
how
you
can
view
matters
from
your
standpoint
for
i
am
in
full
sympathy
with
the
union
and
am
a
woman
but
i
believe
you
to
be
honest
and
i
know
you
to
be
a
gallant
i
clasped
her
hand
close
within
my
own
your
words
encourage
me
greatly
i
said
earnestly
i
have
done
so
much
to
bring
you
trouble
and
sorrow
that
i
have
been
fearful
lest
it
had
cost
me
what
i
value
more
highly
than
you
can
ever
these
words
were
unfortunate
and
instantly
brought
back
to
her
a
memory
which
seemed
a
barrier
between
us
i
read
the
change
in
her
averted
face
that
can
never
be
captain
wayne
she
returned
calmly
yet
rising
even
as
she
spoke
you
have
come
into
my
life
under
circumstances
so
peculiar
as
to
make
me
always
your
friend
celia
and
she
turned
toward
the
others
is
it
not
time
we
were
going
i
am
very
sure
the
doctor
said
you
were
to
remain
with
lieutenant
caton
but
a
brief
why
edith
retorted
the
other
gayly
i
have
been
ready
for
half
an
hour
have
i
arthur
but
you
were
so
deeply
engrossed
with
your
rebel
i
had
the
heart
to
i
could
see
the
quick
color
as
it
mounted
over
brennan
throat
nonsense
she
answered
we
have
not
been
here
that
length
of
did
the
major
emerge
from
out
the
late
entanglement
unhurt
it
was
caton
voice
that
spoke
much
to
his
regret
i
believe
he
was
not
even
under
the
tone
was
cool
and
collected
again
i
will
say
lieutenant
doubtless
we
shall
see
you
at
mountain
view
so
soon
as
you
are
able
to
take
the
journey
and
captain
wayne
i
trust
i
shall
soon
learn
of
your
complete
my
eyes
followed
them
down
the
long
aisle
at
the
entrance
she
glanced
back
and
i
lifted
my
hand
whether
she
marked
the
gesture
i
do
not
know
for
the
next
instant
both
ladies
had
disappeared
without
caton
endeavored
to
talk
with
me
but
i
answered
him
so
briefly
and
with
such
vague
knowledge
of
what
had
been
said
that
he
soon
desisted
i
could
see
only
the
face
that
had
so
lately
bent
above
me
and
reflect
upon
the
fate
which
held
me
helpless
in
its
grasp
i
felt
that
had
circumstances
been
other
than
they
were
this
proudly
tender
woman
might
have
learned
from
me
the
lesson
of
love
and
in
my
weakness
both
of
spirit
and
body
i
rebelled
against
the
impassable
barrier
holding
us
apart
she
was
the
wife
of
another
yet
in
spite
of
every
determination
i
loved
her
with
all
my
soul
the
night
drew
slowly
down
and
as
it
darkened
only
one
miserable
lamp
shed
its
dim
rays
throughout
the
great
tent
nurses
moved
noiselessly
from
cot
to
cot
and
i
learned
something
of
the
nature
of
my
own
injuries
from
the
gruff
old
surgeon
who
dressed
the
wound
in
my
chest
and
refastened
the
splints
along
my
arm
then
silence
followed
excepting
for
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
sleepers
and
the
restless
tossing
of
sufferers
on
their
narrow
cots
here
and
there
echoed
wild
words
of
delirium
but
soon
even
these
faint
sounds
died
away
in
slumber
while
the
drowsy
dozed
in
a
chair
i
could
see
from
where
i
lay
a
blazing
fire
without
while
in
its
glow
along
the
side
of
the
tent
there
was
cast
the
black
shadow
of
a
sentinel
as
he
paced
back
and
forth
along
his
beat
so
clear
were
the
shaded
lines
i
was
able
to
trace
his
gun
and
even
the
peculiar
to
the
visor
of
his
the
pain
i
had
experienced
earlier
in
the
day
grew
less
acute
and
at
last
i
also
fell
asleep
it
must
have
been
midnight
possibly
even
later
when
a
number
of
rapid
shots
fired
outside
the
tent
aroused
me
and
i
heard
many
voices
shouting
mingled
with
the
tread
of
horses
feet
the
had
already
disappeared
and
the
startled
inmates
of
the
tent
were
in
a
state
of
intense
confusion
as
i
lifted
myself
slightly
dazed
by
the
sudden
uproar
and
eager
to
learn
its
cause
the
which
had
been
lowered
to
exclude
the
cold
night
air
was
hastily
jerked
aside
and
a
man
stepped
within
casting
one
rapid
glance
about
that
dim
interior
the
flaring
lamp
overhead
revealed
to
me
a
short
figure
clad
in
a
gray
uniform
no
one
here
need
feel
alarm
he
said
quietly
we
are
not
making
war
upon
the
wounded
are
there
any
confederates
present
able
to
travel
a
dozen
eager
voices
answered
him
and
men
began
to
crawl
out
of
their
cots
onto
the
floor
he
started
down
the
aisle
we
can
be
burdened
with
no
helpless
or
badly
wounded
men
he
said
sternly
only
those
able
to
ride
no
my
man
you
are
in
too
bad
shape
to
travel
very
sorry
my
boy
but
it
ca
be
done
only
your
left
arm
you
say
very
well
move
out
in
front
there
no
lad
it
would
be
the
death
of
you
for
we
must
ride
fast
and
he
came
to
a
pause
a
cots
away
from
me
and
seemed
about
to
retrace
his
steps
dim
as
the
light
was
i
felt
convinced
i
had
formerly
seen
that
short
figure
and
stern
face
with
its
closely
cropped
beard
mosby
i
called
out
resolved
to
risk
his
remembrance
colonel
mosby
is
it
possible
to
take
me
who
are
you
he
questioned
sharply
turning
in
the
direction
of
my
voice
wayne
i
answered
eagerly
wayne
of
the
th
in
an
instant
he
was
standing
beside
my
cot
his
eyes
filled
with
anxious
interest
phil
wayne
of
charlottesville
you
here
not
badly
hurt
my
boy
shot
and
bruised
colonel
but
i
stand
a
good
deal
to
get
out
of
and
by
the
eternal
you
shall
that
is
if
you
can
travel
in
a
wagon
here
sims
thomas
two
of
you
carry
this
officer
out
take
and
all
easy
the
fellows
picked
me
up
tenderly
and
bore
me
slowly
down
the
central
aisle
mosby
walked
beside
us
as
far
as
the
outer
opening
put
him
down
there
by
the
fire
he
ordered
until
i
look
over
the
rest
of
these
chaps
and
divide
the
wheat
from
the
chapter
xxiv
a
night
ride
of
the
wounded
it
was
a
wild
rude
scene
without
yet
in
its
way
typical
of
a
chapter
of
civil
war
moreover
it
was
one
with
which
i
was
not
entirely
unacquainted
years
of
cavalry
scouting
bearing
me
beyond
the
patrol
lines
of
the
two
great
armies
had
frequently
brought
me
into
contact
with
those
various
independent
irregular
forces
which
with
us
often
rendered
most
efficient
service
by
preying
on
the
scattered
federal
camps
and
piercing
their
lines
of
communication
seldom
risking
an
engagement
in
the
open
their
policy
was
rather
to
dash
down
upon
some
outpost
or
poorly
guarded
wagon
train
and
retreat
with
a
rapidity
rendering
pursuit
hopeless
it
was
partisan
warfare
and
appealed
to
many
to
abide
the
stricter
discipline
of
regular
service
these
border
rangers
would
rendezvous
under
some
chosen
leader
strike
an
unexpected
blow
where
weakness
had
been
discovered
then
disappear
as
quickly
as
they
came
oftentimes
scattering
widely
until
the
call
went
forth
for
some
fresh
assault
it
was
service
not
dissimilar
to
that
performed
during
the
revolutionary
struggle
by
sumter
and
marion
in
the
carolinas
and
added
in
the
aggregate
many
a
day
to
the
contest
of
the
confederacy
among
these
wild
rough
riders
between
the
lines
no
leader
was
more
favorably
known
of
our
army
nor
more
dreaded
by
the
enemy
than
mosby
daring
to
the
point
of
recklessness
yet
wary
as
a
fox
counting
opposing
numbers
nothing
when
weighed
against
the
advantage
of
surprise
tireless
in
saddle
audacious
in
resource
quick
to
plan
and
equally
quick
to
execute
he
was
always
where
least
expected
and
it
was
seldom
he
failed
to
win
reward
for
those
who
rode
at
his
back
possessing
regular
rank
in
the
confederate
army
making
report
of
his
operations
to
the
his
peculiar
talent
as
a
partisan
leader
had
won
him
what
was
practically
an
independent
command
knowing
him
as
i
did
i
was
not
surprised
that
he
should
now
have
swept
suddenly
out
of
the
black
night
upon
the
very
verge
of
the
battle
to
drive
his
irritating
sting
into
the
federal
victory
an
empty
army
wagon
the
u
yet
conspicuous
upon
its
canvas
cover
had
been
overturned
and
fired
in
front
of
the
hospital
tent
to
give
light
to
the
raiders
grouped
about
beneath
the
trees
and
within
the
glow
of
the
flames
was
a
picturesque
squad
of
horsemen
hardy
fellows
the
most
of
them
their
clothing
an
odd
mixture
of
uniforms
but
every
man
heavily
armed
and
admirably
equipped
for
service
some
remained
mounted
lounging
carelessly
in
their
saddles
but
far
the
larger
number
were
on
foot
their
wound
about
their
wrists
all
alike
appeared
alert
and
ready
for
any
emergency
how
many
composed
the
party
i
was
unable
to
judge
with
accuracy
as
they
constantly
came
and
went
from
out
the
shadows
beyond
the
circumference
of
the
fire
as
all
sounds
of
firing
had
ceased
i
concluded
that
the
work
planned
had
been
already
accomplished
undoubtedly
surprised
as
they
were
the
small
federal
force
left
to
guard
this
point
had
been
quickly
overwhelmed
and
scattered
the
excitement
attendant
upon
my
release
had
left
me
for
the
time
being
utterly
forgetful
as
to
the
pain
of
my
wounds
so
that
weakness
alone
held
me
to
the
blanket
upon
which
i
had
been
left
the
night
was
decidedly
chilly
yet
i
had
scarcely
begun
to
feel
its
discomfort
when
a
man
strode
forward
from
out
the
nearer
group
and
stood
looking
down
upon
me
he
was
a
young
fellow
wearing
a
gray
artillery
jacket
with
high
cavalry
boots
corning
above
the
knees
i
noticed
his
jaw
and
a
revolver
stuck
carelessly
in
his
belt
but
observed
no
symbol
of
rank
about
him
is
this
captain
wayne
he
asked
not
unpleasantly
i
answered
by
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
he
turned
at
once
toward
the
others
cass
bring
three
men
over
here
and
carry
this
officer
to
the
same
wagon
you
did
the
others
he
commanded
briefly
fix
him
comfortably
but
be
in
a
hurry
about
they
lifted
me
in
the
blanket
one
holding
tightly
at
either
corner
and
bore
me
tenderly
out
into
the
night
once
one
of
them
tripped
over
a
projecting
root
and
the
sudden
jar
of
his
stumble
shot
a
spasm
of
pain
through
me
which
caused
me
to
cry
out
even
through
my
clinched
teeth
pardon
me
lads
i
panted
ashamed
of
the
weakness
but
it
slipped
out
before
i
could
help
do
be
after
a
mentionin
av
it
yer
honor
returned
a
rich
brogue
sure
an
me
feet
got
so
mixed
oup
that
i
wondher
i
did
drap
ye
if
ye
had
clancy
said
the
man
named
cass
grimly
i
reckon
as
how
the
colonel
would
have
drapped
at
the
foot
of
a
narrow
ravine
leading
forth
into
the
broader
valley
we
came
to
a
covered
army
wagon
to
which
four
mules
had
been
already
attached
the
canvas
was
drawn
aside
and
i
was
lifted
up
and
carefully
deposited
in
the
hay
that
thickly
covered
the
bottom
it
was
so
intensely
dark
within
i
could
see
nothing
of
my
immediate
surroundings
but
a
low
moan
told
me
there
must
be
at
least
one
other
wounded
man
present
outside
i
heard
the
tread
of
horses
hoofs
and
then
the
sound
of
mosby
voice
jake
he
said
drive
rapidly
but
with
as
much
care
as
possible
take
the
lower
road
after
you
cross
the
bridge
and
you
will
meet
with
no
patrols
we
will
ride
beside
you
for
a
couple
of
then
a
hand
thrust
aside
the
canvas
and
a
face
peered
in
i
caught
a
faint
glimmer
of
stars
but
could
distinguish
little
else
boys
said
the
leader
kindly
i
wish
i
might
give
you
better
transportation
but
this
is
the
only
form
of
vehicle
we
can
find
i
reckon
you
get
pretty
badly
bumped
over
the
road
you
are
going
but
i
furnishing
you
all
the
chance
to
get
away
in
my
for
one
i
am
grateful
enough
i
answered
after
waiting
for
some
one
else
to
speak
a
little
pain
is
preferable
to
after
you
pass
the
bridge
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
on
that
score
he
said
heartily
anything
more
i
can
do
for
any
of
you
how
many
of
us
are
there
asked
some
one
faintly
from
out
the
darkness
oh
yes
returned
mosby
with
a
laugh
i
forgot
you
will
want
to
know
each
other
there
are
three
of
you
colonel
colby
of
north
carolina
major
wilkins
of
thome
battery
and
captain
wayne
th
virginia
let
that
answer
for
an
introduction
gentlemen
and
now
we
shall
guard
you
as
long
as
necessary
and
then
must
leave
you
to
the
kindly
ministrations
of
the
he
reached
in
leaning
down
from
his
saddle
to
do
so
drew
the
blanket
somewhat
closer
about
me
and
was
gone
i
caught
the
words
of
a
sharp
short
order
and
the
heavy
wagon
lurched
forward
its
wheels
bumping
over
the
irregularities
in
the
road
each
jolt
sending
a
fresh
spasm
of
pain
through
my
tortured
body
may
the
merciful
god
ever
protect
me
from
such
a
ride
again
it
seemed
interminable
while
each
long
mile
we
travelled
brought
with
it
new
and
greater
agony
of
mind
and
body
that
i
did
not
suffer
alone
was
early
evident
from
the
low
moans
borne
to
me
from
out
the
darkness
once
a
weak
trembling
voice
prayed
for
release
a
short
fervent
prayer
which
so
impressed
me
in
the
weakness
of
my
own
anguish
that
i
added
to
it
amen
spoken
unconsciously
aloud
who
spoke
asked
the
same
voice
faintly
i
am
captain
wayne
i
answered
almost
glad
to
break
the
terrible
silence
by
speech
of
any
kind
and
i
merely
echoed
your
prayer
death
would
indeed
prove
a
welcome
relief
from
such
intensity
of
yes
he
acquiesced
gently
i
fear
i
have
not
sufficient
strength
to
bear
mine
for
long
yet
i
am
a
christian
and
there
are
wife
and
child
waiting
for
me
at
home
god
knows
i
am
ready
when
he
calls
but
my
duty
is
to
live
if
possible
for
their
sake
they
will
have
nothing
left
if
i
pass
the
road
must
grow
smoother
as
we
come
down
into
the
valley
are
your
wounds
serious
i
was
struck
by
fragments
of
a
shell
he
answered
and
i
could
tell
he
spoke
the
words
through
his
clinched
teeth
and
am
wounded
in
the
head
as
well
as
the
body
oh
my
god
the
cry
was
wrung
from
him
by
a
sudden
tilting
of
the
wagon
and
for
a
moment
my
own
pain
prevented
utterance
i
hear
nothing
from
the
other
man
i
managed
to
say
at
last
colonel
mosby
said
there
were
three
of
us
surely
the
third
man
can
not
be
already
dead
mercifully
unconscious
i
think
at
least
he
has
made
no
sound
since
i
was
placed
in
no
friends
spoke
another
and
deeper
voice
from
farther
back
within
the
jolting
wagon
i
am
not
unconscious
but
less
noticeably
in
pain
i
have
lost
a
leg
yet
the
stump
seems
seared
and
dead
hurting
me
little
unless
i
touch
we
lapsed
into
solemn
silence
it
was
such
an
effort
to
talk
and
we
had
so
little
to
say
each
man
no
doubt
was
struggling
as
i
know
i
was
to
withhold
expression
of
his
agony
for
the
sake
of
the
others
i
lay
racked
in
every
nerve
my
teeth
tightly
clinched
my
temples
beaded
with
perspiration
i
could
hear
the
troopers
riding
without
the
jingling
of
their
accoutrements
and
the
steady
beat
of
their
horses
feet
being
easily
distinguishable
above
the
deeper
rumble
of
the
wheels
then
there
came
a
quick
order
in
mosby
familiar
voice
a
calling
aloud
of
some
further
directions
to
the
driver
and
afterwards
nothing
was
distinguishable
excepting
the
noise
of
our
own
rapid
progress
jake
drove
it
seemed
to
me
most
recklessly
i
could
hear
the
almost
constant
crack
of
his
lash
and
the
rough
words
of
goading
hurled
at
the
straining
mules
the
road
appeared
to
be
filled
with
roots
while
occasionally
the
wheels
would
strike
a
stone
coming
down
again
with
a
jar
that
nearly
drove
me
frantic
the
chill
night
air
swept
in
through
the
open
front
of
the
hood
and
made
me
feel
as
if
my
veins
were
filled
with
ice
even
while
the
inflammation
of
my
wounds
burned
and
throbbed
as
with
fire
the
pitiful
moaning
of
the
man
who
lay
next
me
grew
gradually
fainter
and
finally
ceased
altogether
tortured
as
i
was
yet
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
wife
and
child
far
away
praying
for
his
safe
return
for
their
sake
i
forced
back
the
intensity
of
my
own
sufferings
and
spoke
into
the
darkness
the
man
who
prayed
i
said
not
knowing
which
of
my
two
companions
it
might
be
are
you
suffering
less
that
you
have
ceased
to
moan
there
was
no
answer
then
the
loose
hay
rustled
as
though
some
one
was
slowly
dragging
his
helpless
body
through
it
a
moment
later
the
deep
voice
spoke
he
is
dead
solemnly
god
has
answered
his
prayer
his
hand
already
begins
to
feel
dead
i
echoed
inexpressibly
shocked
do
you
know
his
name
as
i
am
major
wilkins
it
must
be
colonel
colby
who
has
died
may
god
be
merciful
to
the
widow
and
the
the
hours
that
followed
were
all
but
endless
i
knew
we
had
reached
the
lower
valley
for
the
road
became
more
level
yet
the
slightest
jolting
now
was
sufficient
to
render
me
crazed
with
pain
and
i
had
lost
all
power
of
restraint
my
tortured
nerves
throbbed
the
fever
gripped
me
and
my
mind
began
to
wander
visions
of
delirium
came
and
i
dreamed
dreams
too
terrible
for
record
demons
danced
on
the
drifting
clouds
before
me
while
whirling
savages
chanting
in
horrid
discord
stuck
my
frenzied
body
full
of
blazing
brands
at
times
i
was
awake
calling
in
vain
for
water
to
quench
a
thirst
which
grew
maddening
then
i
lapsed
into
a
that
drove
me
wild
with
its
delirious
fancies
i
knew
vaguely
that
the
major
had
crept
back
through
the
darkness
and
passed
his
strong
arm
gently
beneath
my
head
i
heard
him
shouting
in
his
deep
voice
to
the
driver
for
something
to
drink
but
was
unaware
of
any
response
all
became
blurred
confused
bewildering
i
thought
it
was
my
mother
comforting
me
the
faint
gray
daylight
stole
in
at
last
through
the
cracks
of
the
wagon
cover
i
could
dimly
distinguish
a
dark
face
bending
over
me
framed
by
a
heavy
gray
beard
and
then
merciful
unconsciousness
came
and
i
rested
as
one
dead
beside
the
corpse
of
the
colonel
chapter
xxv
a
lost
regiment
it
was
a
bright
sunshiny
day
in
early
spring
birds
were
sweetly
singing
in
the
trees
lining
the
road
i
was
travelling
the
grass
on
either
side
was
softly
green
and
beautified
by
countless
blooming
in
great
variety
of
coloring
nothing
seemed
to
speak
of
war
although
i
was
amid
the
very
heart
of
its
desolation
save
the
deserted
houses
i
was
continually
passing
and
the
fenceless
untilled
fields
i
must
have
shown
my
late
illness
greatly
for
the
few
i
met
as
i
tramped
slowly
onward
mostly
soldiers
gazed
at
me
curiously
as
if
they
mistook
me
for
the
ghost
of
some
dead
comrade
and
i
doubt
not
my
pale
face
yet
bearing
the
deep
imprint
of
pain
with
the
long
untrimmed
hair
framing
it
and
the
ragged
uniform
the
same
i
wore
that
fierce
day
of
battle
rendered
me
an
object
of
wonder
all
through
those
long
weary
winter
weeks
i
had
been
hovering
between
life
and
death
in
an
obscure
hospital
at
richmond
how
i
first
came
there
i
know
not
but
when
at
length
i
struggled
back
to
recollection
and
life
there
i
found
myself
and
there
i
remained
slowly
convalescing
a
prisoner
to
weakness
until
finally
discharged
but
two
days
before
during
those
months
little
that
related
to
the
progress
of
the
war
reached
me
my
nurses
were
nuns
and
tender
of
touch
but
feeling
slight
interest
in
affairs
of
the
world
without
i
saw
no
familiar
faces
while
the
few
wounded
about
me
were
fully
as
ignorant
of
passing
events
as
myself
the
moment
the
door
was
opened
to
permit
of
my
passing
forth
into
the
world
again
i
sought
eagerly
to
discover
the
present
station
of
my
old
comrades
in
arms
yet
could
learn
only
that
the
cavalry
brigade
with
which
i
had
formerly
served
was
in
camp
somewhere
near
appomattox
court
house
on
foot
and
moneyless
i
set
off
alone
my
sole
anxiety
to
be
once
more
with
friends
and
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
day
i
was
already
beyond
petersburg
and
sturdily
pushing
westward
a
battery
of
light
artillery
was
parked
in
a
field
upon
my
right
but
so
far
away
from
the
road
that
i
hesitated
to
travel
that
distance
simply
to
ask
a
question
which
it
was
extremely
doubtful
if
they
would
be
able
to
answer
instead
i
pushed
on
grimly
and
as
the
road
swerved
slightly
to
the
left
passing
through
a
grove
of
handsome
trees
i
came
suddenly
opposite
a
large
house
of
imposing
aspect
a
group
of
confederate
officers
stood
in
converse
beside
the
gate
leading
into
the
open
driveway
and
as
i
paused
a
moment
gazing
at
them
and
wondering
whom
i
had
better
address
for
i
recognized
none
of
the
faces
fronting
me
one
among
the
group
turned
suddenly
and
took
a
hurried
step
in
my
direction
as
though
despatched
upon
an
errand
of
importance
he
was
a
tall
slender
man
wearing
a
long
gray
moustache
and
i
no
sooner
viewed
his
face
than
i
recognized
him
as
having
been
one
of
those
officers
present
in
general
lee
tent
the
day
i
was
sent
out
with
despatches
he
glanced
at
me
curiously
yet
with
no
sign
of
recognition
but
before
he
could
pass
i
accosted
him
colonel
maitland
i
said
you
doubtless
remember
me
i
am
seeking
my
old
command
would
you
kindly
inform
me
where
it
may
be
found
he
stopped
instantly
at
sound
of
my
voice
and
stared
at
me
in
odd
bewilderment
but
my
words
had
already
reached
the
ears
of
the
others
and
before
he
had
found
an
answer
another
voice
spoke
sternly
what
is
all
this
who
are
you
sir
what
masquerade
puts
you
into
that
parody
of
a
captain
uniform
i
turned
and
looked
into
the
flushed
indignant
face
of
general
lee
it
is
no
masquerade
sir
i
answered
instantly
removing
my
hat
it
is
the
rightful
uniform
of
my
rank
greatly
as
i
regret
its
present
he
gazed
at
me
keenly
evidently
doubtful
as
to
his
best
course
of
action
and
i
heard
an
officer
behind
him
laugh
where
are
you
from
i
was
discharged
from
mary
hospital
in
richmond
day
before
yesterday
and
am
now
seeking
to
rejoin
my
i
almost
imagined
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
soldier
crazed
by
his
sufferings
i
heard
a
whisper
out
of
his
head
yet
as
i
gazed
earnestly
into
those
stern
gray
eyes
which
fronted
me
they
suddenly
grew
moist
surely
he
said
gravely
i
have
seen
your
face
before
to
what
regiment
were
you
attached
the
th
virginia
the
buzzing
of
voices
about
me
instantly
ceased
and
general
lee
took
a
step
nearer
the
th
virginia
you
were
a
captain
surely
this
is
not
philip
wayne
so
deeply
surprised
was
his
tone
so
uncertain
his
recognition
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
answer
had
i
lost
my
very
identity
was
this
all
a
dream
i
am
captain
wayne
troop
d
th
he
grasped
my
hand
warmly
between
both
his
own
and
his
kindly
face
lit
up
instantly
with
a
rare
smile
captain
wayne
i
can
not
tell
you
how
greatly
i
rejoice
at
your
safe
return
we
certainly
owe
you
an
apology
for
this
poor
reception
but
you
were
reported
as
killed
in
action
many
months
ago
i
doubt
not
colonel
maitland
truly
believed
he
looked
upon
a
ghost
when
you
first
accosted
for
the
moment
i
was
unable
to
speak
so
deeply
did
his
words
affect
me
i
fear
captain
wayne
he
continued
gravely
yet
retaining
my
hand
within
his
own
that
i
must
bring
you
sad
sad
news
instantly
there
came
to
me
the
thought
of
my
widowed
mother
not
from
home
i
trust
sir
no
with
great
tenderness
your
mother
i
believe
remains
well
yet
the
words
i
must
speak
are
nevertheless
sad
ones
and
must
prove
a
severe
shock
to
you
there
is
no
th
no
th
virginia
i
echoed
scarce
able
to
comprehend
his
meaning
no
th
virginia
i
beg
you
to
explain
sir
surely
and
i
looked
about
me
upon
the
various
uniforms
of
the
service
present
the
war
has
not
yet
ceased
we
have
not
surrendered
no
my
boy
and
the
old
hero
reverently
bared
his
gray
head
in
the
sunlight
but
the
th
virginia
gave
itself
to
the
south
that
day
in
the
i
must
have
grown
very
white
for
a
young
aide
sprang
hastily
forward
and
passed
his
arm
about
me
yet
i
scarcely
realized
the
action
for
my
whole
thought
was
with
the
dead
do
you
mean
they
are
all
gone
i
questioned
tremblingly
hardly
able
to
grasp
the
full
dread
import
of
such
ghastly
tidings
surely
general
lee
some
among
them
must
have
come
so
few
he
responded
soberly
his
hat
still
retained
in
his
hand
so
very
few
that
we
could
only
scatter
them
in
other
commands
but
you
have
not
yet
fully
recovered
your
strength
you
must
not
remain
longer
standing
here
major
holmes
will
you
kindly
conduct
captain
wayne
to
my
headquarters
and
see
that
he
is
furnished
with
a
uniform
suitable
to
his
rank
for
the
present
he
will
serve
as
extra
aide
upon
my
personal
i
turned
away
the
major
leading
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
child
i
walked
as
a
man
stunned
by
some
sudden
unexpected
blow
speech
was
impossible
for
all
sensation
seemed
dead
within
me
save
the
one
vivid
memory
of
those
loved
comrades
who
had
perished
on
the
field
i
could
not
realize
even
dimly
in
that
awful
hour
that
of
all
those
gallant
fellows
who
had
ridden
so
often
at
my
side
not
enough
remained
alive
to
retain
the
old
regimental
name
and
number
the
officer
with
me
himself
a
tried
true
soldier
comprehended
something
of
the
agitation
which
swayed
me
and
respecting
my
silence
made
no
attempt
to
break
my
sorrowful
reverie
by
speech
at
the
door
of
the
room
assigned
me
for
present
quarters
he
left
me
with
a
warm
sympathetic
pressure
of
the
hand
and
feeling
utterly
worn
out
disheartened
to
a
degree
i
had
never
before
known
i
flung
myself
face
downward
upon
the
cot
and
burst
into
tears
with
true
soldierly
kindness
they
left
me
to
conquer
my
own
sorrow
and
depression
and
when
i
finally
joined
the
mess
upon
the
following
day
clad
now
in
fit
uniform
i
had
regained
no
small
measure
of
and
with
it
came
likewise
renewal
of
the
military
spirit
my
welcome
proved
extremely
cordial
and
the
conversation
of
the
others
present
soon
placed
in
my
possession
whatever
of
incident
had
occurred
since
that
disastrous
day
of
battle
in
the
valley
it
was
not
much
other
than
a
variety
of
desultory
skirmishing
together
with
the
steady
closing
in
upon
our
lines
of
the
overwhelming
masses
of
the
enemy
but
i
noted
that
the
officers
of
the
staff
no
longer
hesitated
to
voice
frankly
the
prevailing
sentiment
that
the
vast
and
unequal
struggle
was
now
rapidly
drawing
to
its
close
no
attempt
was
made
to
conceal
our
weakness
nor
to
disguise
the
fact
that
we
were
making
a
last
desperate
stand
it
was
evident
to
all
that
nothing
now
remained
but
to
fold
our
tattered
with
honor
directly
opposite
me
at
the
long
and
rather
scantily
furnished
was
seated
a
captain
of
infantry
quite
foreign
in
appearance
a
tall
slender
man
wearing
a
moustache
and
goatee
his
name
as
i
gathered
from
the
conversation
was
carlson
and
i
was
considerably
surprised
at
the
fixedness
with
which
his
eyes
were
fastened
upon
me
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
meal
thinking
we
might
have
met
somewhere
before
i
ransacked
my
memory
in
vain
for
any
recollection
which
would
serve
to
account
for
his
evident
interest
in
me
finally
not
a
little
annoyed
by
the
persistency
of
his
stare
i
ventured
to
ask
as
pleasantly
as
possible
captain
carlson
do
i
remind
you
of
some
one
since
you
regard
me
so
intently
the
man
instantly
flushed
all
over
his
fair
face
at
this
direct
inquiry
it
vas
not
dat
he
almost
stammered
in
sudden
confusion
speaking
quite
brokenly
bot
sair
it
haf
come
to
me
dat
you
vos
an
insulter
of
womens
an
had
refuse
to
fight
mit
mens
i
know
not
it
seems
not
i
was
upon
my
feet
in
an
instant
scarcely
crediting
my
own
ears
yet
on
fire
with
indignation
i
know
not
what
you
may

he
pushed
his
chair
hastily
back
his
face
fairly
crimson
and
began
to
stammer
an
explanation
but
maitland
interfered
what
does
all
this
mean
carlson
he
exclaimed
sternly
sit
down
wayne
there
is
some
strange
mistake
i
resumed
my
chair
wondering
if
they
had
all
gone
crazy
yet
resolved
upon
taking
instant
action
if
some
satisfactory
explanation
were
not
at
once
forthcoming
come
carlson
what
do

language
to

the

so
agitated
by

excitement
about

he

scarcely

an

he
looked
about
him
anxiously
to
see
if
we
comprehended
his
words
and
what
did
you
say
from
a
dozen
eager
voices
the
swede
gazed
at
them
in
manifest
astonishment
i

what

this

look
like

vos
a
pig
vellow
mit
a
black
moustache
and
gray
do
you
know
him
questioned
maitland
his
name
is
brennan
i
answered
slowly
a
major
in
the
federal
service
we
have
already
met
twice
in
rough
and
tumble
contests
but
the
next
time
it
will
be
with
there
is
a
woman
then
it
seems
from
captain
carlson
report
he
has
seen
fit
to
connect
one
with
our
there
was
a
pause
as
if
they
waited
for
me
to
add
some
further
explanation
but
i
could
not
her
name
should
never
be
idly
discussed
about
a
through
any
word
of
mine
gentlemen
said
maitland
at
last
gravely
this
is
evidently
a
personal
matter
with
which
we
have
no
direct
concern
captain
reputation
is
not
one
to
be
questioned
either
as
regards
his
chivalry
toward
women
or
his
bravery
in
arms
i
pledge
you
his
early
meeting
with
this
they
drank
the
toast
standing
and
i
read
in
each
face
before
me
a
frank
soldierly
confidence
and
comradeship
which
caused
my
heart
to
glow
chapter
xxvi
the
scouting
detail
this
premeditated
insult
which
brennan
had
evidently
despatched
broadcast
in
hope
that
through
some
unknown
channel
it
might
reach
me
changed
my
entire
relationship
with
the
man
heretofore
while
feeling
deep
resentment
toward
him
i
yet
was
strongly
inclined
to
avoid
any
personal
meeting
fear
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
shrinking
on
my
part
nor
would
i
have
deliberately
avoided
him
yet
as
the
husband
of
edith
brennan
i
realized
that
if
he
suffered
seriously
at
my
hands
it
must
for
ever
separate
us
i
felt
more
and
more
deeply
the
shame
of
loving
the
wife
of
another
and
certainly
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
advertise
her
as
in
any
way
the
cause
of
so
disgraceful
a
brawl
far
better
was
it
for
me
to
suffer
in
silence
any
taunts
and
degradations
he
chose
to
place
upon
me
surely
i
loved
her
well
enough
to
remain
patient
for
her
sake
but
now
all
this
had
been
changed
by
a
word
his
deliberate
attempt
to
soil
my
reputation
among
officers
of
my
own
corps
left
me
no
choice
but
that
of
a
resort
to
arms
i
have
never
felt
that
brennan
was
at
heart
a
bad
man
he
was
hard
stern
revengeful
yet
i
have
no
doubt
under
different
circumstances
i
might
even
have
valued
him
highly
as
a
comrade
or
a
friend
there
is
no
demon
like
jealousy
and
his
early
distrust
of
me
fostered
by
that
mad
disease
had
apparently
warped
his
entire
nature
yet
not
even
for
love
could
i
consent
to
leave
my
honor
undefended
and
after
those
hateful
words
there
could
be
no
rest
for
me
until
our
differences
were
settled
by
the
stern
arbitrament
of
the
naked
blade
all
prudence
to
the
winds
no
opportunity
of
meeting
him
should
now
be
cast
aside
i
decided
this
carefully
before
falling
asleep
and
had
almost
determined
upon
seeking
release
from
immediate
duty
that
i
might
hunt
him
out
even
within
the
fancied
security
of
his
own
camp
this
latter
plan
however
was
instantly
halted
by
those
events
which
crowded
swiftly
upon
me
the
coming
day
was
barely
gray
in
the
east
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
heavy
pounding
upon
the
door
a
orderly
stood
without
captain
wayne
he
asked
that
is
my
name
what
have
you
my
man
compliments
of
colonel
maitland
chief
of
staff
sir
he
said
handing
me
a
folded
paper
i
opened
it
eagerly
for
i
was
more
than
ready
to
welcome
any
occurrence
which
would
help
to
change
the
tenor
of
my
thought
dear
wayne
the
private
note
read
believing
you
would
be
glad
to
have
the
detail
i
have
just
arranged
to
send
you
at
once
upon
some
active
service
please
report
at
these
quarters
immediately
fully
equipped
for
the
glad
it
was
the
very
medicine
i
most
needed
and
within
twenty
minutes
of
my
receipt
of
this
communication
i
was
with
maitland
thanking
him
warmly
for
his
thoughtfulness
not
another
word
wayne
he
insisted
it
is
not
much
a
mere
scouting
detail
over
neutral
territory
and
will
probably
prove
dull
enough
i
only
hope
it
may
help
to
divert
your
mind
a
trifle
now
listen
you
are
to
proceed
with
twenty
mounted
men
of
the
escort
west
as
far
as
the
and
are
expected
to
note
carefully
three
things
first
the
condition
of
forage
for
the
sustenance
of
a
wagon
train
second
what
forces
of
federal
troops
if
any
are
along
the
honeywell
and
third
the
gathering
of
all
information
obtainable
as
to
the
reported
consolidation
of
guerillas
for
purposes
of
plunder
between
the
lines
if
time
suffice
you
might
cross
over
into
the
valley
of
the
cowskin
and
learn
the
condition
of
forage
there
as
well
a
guide
will
accompany
your
party
and
you
are
to
avoid
contact
with
the
enemy
as
far
as
possible
your
men
carry
five
days
rations
you
understand
fully
i
do
sir
i
presume
i
am
to
start
at
once
your
squad
under
command
of
sergeant
ebers
is
already
waiting
i
found
them
a
sturdy
looking
lot
but
as
they
composed
a
portion
of
the
commander
personal
guard
somewhat
better
attired
than
i
was
accustomed
to
seeing
confederate
soldiers
i
possessed
a
field
prejudice
relative
to
escort
soldiery
yet
their
equipment
looked
well
they
sat
their
horses
easily
and
i
could
find
nothing
worthy
of
criticism
i
should
have
preferred
riding
at
the
head
of
men
from
my
old
troop
but
in
all
probability
we
would
none
of
us
be
called
upon
to
draw
a
sabre
are
you
all
ready
sergeant
i
asked
of
the
rather
german
who
stood
fronting
me
his
broad
red
face
as
impassive
as
though
carved
from
stone
ve
vos
where
is
the
guide
dot
is
him
mit
der
mule
ai
it
he
answered
pointing
with
one
huge
hand
down
the
road
very
well
we
will
pick
him
up
then
as
we
i
cared
so
little
as
to
whether
or
not
he
accompanied
us
at
all
that
we
had
advanced
some
distance
before
the
thought
of
him
again
occurred
to
me
i
knew
the
gentry
fairly
well
and
had
experienced
in
the
past
so
many
evidences
of
their
stupidity
if
not
actual
disloyalty
as
to
prefer
my
own
knowledge
of
the
country
to
theirs
my
thought
indeed
for
several
miles
was
not
at
all
with
the
little
party
of
troopers
jogging
steadily
at
my
heels
nor
in
truth
was
it
greatly
concerned
with
the
fate
of
the
expedition
that
was
but
service
routine
and
i
rode
forward
carelessly
enough
never
once
dreaming
that
every
hour
of
progress
was
bearing
me
toward
the
most
important
adventure
of
my
life
so
i
feel
we
constantly
advance
into
the
future
and
it
is
well
that
we
do
not
know
for
few
would
possess
the
necessary
courage
if
beforehand
we
might
perceive
the
sorrows
and
the
dangers
outside
my
military
duties
i
had
but
one
thought
in
those
days
edith
brennan
the
great
struggle
was
rapidly
drawing
to
its
close
hope
of
future
military
preferment
could
no
longer
inspire
a
confederate
soldier
for
we
realized
fully
we
were
battling
in
a
lost
cause
all
ambition
which
i
might
otherwise
have
experienced
was
therefore
concentrated
by
this
fate
upon
the
woman
i
loved
and
how
earnestly
i
endeavored
not
to
love
her
how
i
sought
to
stifle
such
feeling
to
remain
true
to
what
i
deemed
my
highest
duty
to
her
and
to
my
own
honor
and
yet
she
remained
my
constant
dream
i
thought
of
her
now
as
i
rode
into
the
west
somewhere
out
yonder
amid
those
distant
blue
hills
ay
even
within
the
very
zone
of
my
present
duty
it
was
possible
she
yet
waited
for
the
war
to
cease
i
wished
in
my
heart
i
might
again
meet
her
and
then
roundly
denounced
myself
as
a
cur
for
having
such
a
desire
yet
again
and
again
would
the
fond
hope
recur
surging
up
unbidden
into
my
brain
as
i
rode
steadily
forward
oblivious
of
both
distance
and
pace
the
sinking
sun
full
in
my
eyes
yet
utterly
forgetful
of
the
pounding
along
behind
me
it
was
the
german
sergeant
who
recalled
me
to
the
responsibilities
of
command
captain
he
exclaimed
apologetically
riding
up
to
my
side
and
wiping
his
round
perspiring
face
with
great
energy
ve
are
riding
too
hard
ai
ve
mein
gott
but
der
horses
vill
give
out
ontirely
is
that
so
i
asked
in
surprise
at
his
words
a
single
swift
glance
around
convinced
me
he
was
correct
for
the
mounts
were
exceedingly
soft
and
already
looked
nearly
played
out
from
our
sharp
pace
very
well
ebers
we
will
halt
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
drew
back
and
as
he
did
so
my
eyes
fell
for
the
first
time
upon
the
guide
as
i
live
it
was
jed
bungay
and
when
i
stared
at
him
in
sudden
amazement
he
broke
into
a
broad
grin
trickled
still
the
starting
tear
when
light
a
footstep
struck
her
ear
and
snowdoun
graceful
knight
was
near
he
quoted
gravely
his
eyes
brightening
at
my
recognition
durn
if
i
did
begin
ter
think
as
how
ye
gone
an
clar
fergot
me
not
a
bit
of

and
i
rode
up
to
him
and
extended
my
hand
but
how
came
you
here
are
you

guide

the
fleshy
sergeant
was
undoubtedly
fatigued
yet
he
was
a
thorough
soldier
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
although
he
moved
as
if
his
coarse
army
trousers
were
constant
torture
he
was
not
guilty
of
omitting
any
known
requirement
of
his

rumors
of
this
state
of
affairs
to
north
and
west
of
our
defending
lines
had
already
reached
me
indeed
the
verification
had
formed
part
of
my
instructions
but
bungay
homely
yet
graphic
description
made
the
situation
appear
terribly
real
and
my
thought
went
instantly
forth
to
those
i
knew
who
might
even
then
be
exposed
to
this
great
and
unexpected
danger
that
it
was
indeed
menacing
and
constantly
growing
worse
i
could
not
doubt
the
certainty
of
our
early
defeat
was
leading
to
almost
wholesale
desertions
and
doubtless
many
of
these
went
to
swell
those
lawless
ranks
whose
sole
purpose
was
plunder
and
whose
safe
rendezvous
was
the
inaccessible
mountains
wherever
the
guarding
armies
left
neutral
ground
there
these
bands
overflowed
and
inaugurated
a
reign
of
terror
what
they
had
been
in
their
weakness
i
knew
well
through
experiences
of
the
past
what
they
might
become
in
strength
i
could
readily
conjecture
wild
wolves
of
the
hills
to
whom
human
life
was
of
no
account
the
fierce
spawn
of
civil
war
the
very
conception
of
edith
brennan
in
such
hands
as
these
was
agony
i
felt
i
could
never
rest
until
assured
of
her
safety
and
since
my
orders
granted
me
full
authority
to
prolong
my
journey
i
might
ascertain
whether
or
not
she
yet
remained
within
the
valley
jed
i
asked
my
mind
finally
settled

how
long
would
it
take
us
to
reach
there
two
days
i
reckon
pervidin
ye
shuck
ther
i
turned
and
looked
at
my
men
in
some
perplexity
they
were
scattered
along
the
edge
of
the
road
and
only
one
group
had
taken
the
precaution
to
build
a
fire
the
sergeant
lay
flat
upon
his
back
on
a
grassy
knoll
his
stomach
rising
and
falling
with
a
regularity
which
convinced
me
he
was
sleeping
ebers
i
said
sternly
there
was
no
response
and
i
could
distinguish
clearly
his
heavy
breathing
one
of
you
stir
up
the
sergeant
will
you
i
want
to
speak
with
a
young
fellow
came
forward
grinning
and
laid
one
hand
heavily
on
his
officer
shoulder
come
dutchy
he
said
with
easy
familiarity
get
up
the
sergeant
shot
to
an
upright
position
like
a
mein
gott
he
asked
anxiously
is
it
der
yanks
vot
come
already
hell
no
but
the
captain
wants
der
captain
he
arose
ponderously
and
came
forward
with
a
decidedly
halting
gait
vos
i
sent
for
he
asked
yes
i
said
i
want
you
to
have
the
men
get
their
supper
at
once
as
we
shall
be
obliged
to
ride
a
good
portion
of
the
ride
and
his
face
took
on
an
expression
of
genuine
horror
by
chiminy
captain

it
could
not
be

chapter
xxvii
an
embarrassing
situation
it
was
well
into
the
third
day
when
we
came
down
into
the
fertile
valley
of
the
cowskin
it
had
proven
an
uneventful
ride
thus
far
for
we
had
met
with
no
adventures
and
had
observed
little
worthy
of
consideration
from
a
military
standpoint
we
had
travelled
slowly
carefully
watchful
of
our
horses
not
only
because
we
felt
they
might
be
greatly
needed
farther
on
but
owing
to
the
impoverished
and
almost
deserted
country
through
which
we
rode
abandoned
houses
many
of
them
devastated
by
fire
deserted
negro
quarters
and
uncultivated
fields
greeted
our
eyes
constantly
and
told
us
we
were
in
the
track
of
armies
forage
there
was
absolutely
none
while
even
the
gave
small
return
the
men
had
done
well
however
and
were
stiffening
nicely
into
field
soldiers
while
my
teutonic
second
in
command
had
sufficiently
recovered
from
his
wounds
to
sit
his
saddle
with
some
elephantine
grace
he
early
proved
himself
a
good
soldier
and
i
learned
he
had
seen
considerable
active
service
in
europe
while
constantly
observant
of
those
points
regarding
which
i
had
been
despatched
my
one
overmastering
thought
during
all
those
hours
was
the
possibility
of
again
meeting
with
edith
brennan
and
proving
of
some
assistance
to
her
her
greeting
of
me
in
the
federal
hospital
had
been
so
sweetly
gracious
so
marked
with
tender
sympathy
while
the
memory
of
her
words
and
even
more
of
the
look
which
accompanied
them
had
so
remained
with
me
in
encouragement
that
i
longed
to
encounter
her
again
god
knows
what
i
hoped
for
for
i
knew
well
it
must
all
inevitably
end
in
despair
yet
like
the
moth
i
must
continue
to
singe
my
wings
until
the
flame
devoured
me
now
however
as
we
actually
drew
near
to
where
i
supposed
she
might
be
i
felt
my
earlier
courage
fast
deserting
me
nor
was
i
furnished
with
even
the
slightest
excuse
for
pressing
on
my
orders
did
not
positively
compel
me
to
proceed
and
nothing
appeared
along
the
way
to
lead
me
to
suppose
that
harm
of
any
kind
threatened
that
peaceful
valley
everything
meeting
my
eyes
evidenced
that
here
at
least
war
with
its
attendant
horrors
had
not
come
totally
without
the
beaten
track
of
those
great
armies
which
had
battled
so
fiercely
for
the
shenandoah
it
had
been
traversed
only
by
a
few
scouting
and
foraging
parties
and
so
short
had
been
their
stay
that
even
the
rail
fences
remained
undisturbed
to
guard
the
fields
and
nowhere
did
i
note
outward
signs
of
devastation
it
was
virginia
as
i
recalled
it
in
those
old
days
of
peace
and
plenty
before
civil
strife
had
sown
the
land
with
dead
what
possible
excuse
then
had
i
for
going
there
in
my
own
heart
i
knew
i
had
none
or
one
so
poor
and
selfish
i
scarcely
durst
whisper
it
even
to
myself
yet
i
rode
steadily
on
impelled
by
my
own
weakness
or
drawn
irresistibly
by
fate
whichever
the
real
cause
i
know
not
i
would
at
least
look
upon
those
walls
that
had
once
sheltered
her
would
learn
if
possible
if
she
was
yet
there
then
well
in
the
bondage
of
my
passion
i
hoped
for
what
might
happen
as
every
lover
does
it
must
have
been
two
we
had
baited
our
horses
i
remember
an
hour
previous
and
the
sergeant
had
enjoyed
his
noonday
siesta
beneath
the
shade
of
a
great
bush
bearing
purple
blossoms
the
road
we
had
been
travelling
since
early
morning
wound
in
and
out
among
great
trees
and
crossed
and
recrossed
the
little
stream
called
the
cowskin
until
i
almost
thought
we
had
lost
our
way
we
met
with
no
one
in
all
the
long
day
riding
not
even
a
stray
negro
and
indeed
it
was
some
hours
since
we
had
passed
a
house
of
any
kind
leaving
the
brook
behind
us
we
toiled
slowly
up
a
long
hill
and
at
the
top
bungay
riding
beside
me
pointed
to
the
westward
cap
he
said
thar
is
ther
minor
the
very
sight
of
it
in
the
distance
was
a
thrill
a
great
white
house
placed
well
back
from
the
road
and
almost
hidden
from
sight
by
fine
large
trees
an
house
it
looked
to
be
built
after
the
colonial
type
a
wide
veranda
upon
three
sides
with
fluted
columns
to
support
the
overhanging
roof
hai
no
signs
es
fer
es
i
kin
see
of
any
trouble
havin
thar
jed
said
slowly
his
shrewd
gray
eyes
roaming
over
the
peaceful
scene
somebody
ter
hum
tew
fer
ther
chimley
is
a
of
course
now
i
was
there
the
only
sensible
thing
for
me
to
do
would
have
been
to
ride
openly
to
the
front
door
and
thus
learn
all
i
desired
but
what
man
who
loves
who
is
continually
swayed
by
hopes
and
fears
by
strength
and
weakness
ever
does
the
sensible
thing
i
had
certainly
intended
doing
so
at
the
start
but
now
my
nerve
failed
me
she
was
the
wife
of
another
i
could
not
confess
i
had
ventured
to
come
to
her
in
love
nor
could
i
look
into
those
clear
honest
questioning
eyes
and
lie
halt
i
ordered
sergeant
i
am
here
take
your
men
down
into
that
hollow
yonder
and
remain
there
until
i
return
better
post
a
sentry
on
the
hill
it
vill
be
done
i
shall
not
probably
be
absent
more
than
an
hour
so
do
permit
the
men
to
dot
is
it
captain
i
vill
be
mit
dem
all
i
rode
down
alone
into
the
thick
woods
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
dismounting
tied
my
horse
to
a
sapling
then
on
foot
i
struck
across
the
fields
my
intention
being
to
come
in
by
way
of
the
negro
quarters
at
the
rear
in
hope
of
meeting
some
one
from
whom
i
might
inquire
relative
to
the
great
house
and
its
inmates
it
was
a
slight
upward
trend
of
land
i
had
to
traverse
and
although
the
house
was
a
most
sightly
object
and
stood
upon
the
very
summit
of
the
elevation
yet
so
surrounded
was
it
with
trees
both
fruit
and
ornamental
i
was
enabled
to
make
but
little
of
its
situation
until
i
approached
the
i
met
with
no
one
nor
could
i
perceive
any
negroes
about
the
slave
quarters
yet
the
place
did
not
bear
the
appearance
of
desertion
there
were
horses
in
the
stable
a
cat
was
curled
up
on
one
of
the
cabin
doorsteps
and
smoke
continued
to
pour
in
a
dull
yellow
cloud
from
the
kitchen
chimney
altogether
there
was
much
in
the
situation
to
puzzle
over
and
i
no
longer
regretted
that
i
had
exercised
some
caution
in
my
approach
the
orchard
with
the
remains
of
a
garden
lay
between
the
house
and
the
stable
protected
by
a
low
fence
of
whitened
pickets
so
far
as
i
could
observe
it
contained
no
occupant
and
i
pushed
open
the
gate
and
started
down
a
narrow
which
led
between
two
rows
of
low
bushes
to
right
of
me
was
an
extensive
completely
covered
with
vines
the
fresh
green
leaves
forming
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
deep
blue
sky
beyond
as
i
came
opposite
an
opening
leading
into
this
arbor
i
suddenly
caught
the
flutter
of
drapery
and
stopped
instantly
my
heart
throbbing
like
a
frightened
girl
it
was
quite
dark
beneath
the
vine
shadow
and
i
could
make
out
no
more
than
that
a
woman
stood
there
her
back
toward
me
busied
at
some
task
possibly
she
felt
my
presence
for
all
at
once
she
glanced
around
and
upon
perceiving
me
gave
vent
to
a
quick
exclamation
of
terror
pardon
me
i
said
hastily
and
removing
my
hat
but
you
have
nothing
to
there
was
a
moment
hesitancy
on
her
part
and
i
knew
i
was
being
scrutinized
by
a
pair
of
bright
eyes
surely
said
a
familiar
voice
i
can
not
be
mistaken
you
are
captain
before
i
could
even
answer
she
stepped
forth
from
her
partial
concealment
and
advanced
toward
me
with
cordially
extended
hands
it
was
celia
minor
well
of
all
men
she
cried
gayly
her
dark
eyes
smiling
a
most
kindly
welcome
and
edith
and
i
were
speaking
about
you
only
yesterday
that
is
i
was
for
really
i
do
not
recall
now
that
edith
made
any
remark
apropos
of
the
subject
you
have
no
idea
captain
wayne
what
a
hero
i
have
made
you
out
to
be
it
would
make
you
positively
vain
if
i
should
confess
why
arthur
has
actually
become
so
jealous
that
he
has
almost
forbidden
me
even
to
mention
your
name
in
his
presence
so
when
i
want
to
talk
about
you
i
am
compelled
to
go
to
edith
she
has
power
to
stop
me
you
know
but
i
sure
i
must
bore
her
awfully
and
then
to
think
that
when
you
stood
there
just
now
and
i
saw
your
gray
uniform
i
actually
thought
the
guerillas
had
come
my
heart
beats
so
now
i
can
hardly
talk
but
how
pale
and
haggard
you
look
is
it
that
horrible
wound
which
troubles
you
still
i
have
been
discharged
from
the
hospital
only
a
short
time
i
answered
as
she
paused
to
take
breath
indeed
this
is
my
first
military
service
for
several
months
yet
i
am
feeling
quite
strong
again
brennan
then
is
still
with
you
oh
yes
we
have
been
here
all
winter
long
it
has
been
so
dull
for
really
nothing
has
happened
and
the
valley
is
quite
devoid
of
inhabitants
even
the
negroes
have
gone
hunting
freedom
but
major
brennan
and
arthur
are
to
be
here
this
afternoon
and
sometime
we
are
all
of
us
going
away
together
how
glad
i
am
you
arrived
before
we
left
i
would
have
missed
meeting
you
for
worlds
do
you
know
it
is
so
hard
for
me
not
to
call
you
colonel
curran
but
edith
always
insists
on
my
saying
captain
wayne
so
that
it
comes
more
natural
now
really
sometimes
i
actually
believe
she
has
corrected
me
a
dozen
times
a
day
for
you
know
we
have
so
little
to
talk
about
here
that
we
are
always
drifting
back
to
what
occurred
to
us
while
we
were
with
the
army
i
often
wonder
edith
can
be
contented
here
at
all
but
she
really
seems
to
regret
that
we
must
leave
i
sure
i
do
even
if
i
was
born
here
it
an
awful
poky
old
i
gave
heed
to
but
little
of
her
chatter
after
the
first
sentence
eager
as
i
was
to
meet
brennan
i
had
no
desire
that
we
should
meet
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
better
far
better
would
it
be
for
me
to
leave
at
once
and
without
even
seeing
her
you
say
you
are
about
to
depart
i
asked
determined
to
learn
all
possible
regarding
their
plans
do
you
go
north
yes
to
baltimore
and
washington
the
guerillas
are
becoming
so
desperate
in
this
neighborhood
that
we
are
actually
afraid
to
remain
here
longer
they
attacked
the
cuyler
plantation
only
ten
miles
from
here
two
weeks
ago
killed
old
cuyler
turned
his
wife
out
partially
dressed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
looted
the
house
of
everything
it
contained
of
value
and
then
set
it
on
fire
you
see
we
have
no
men
folks
here
except
two
negroes
who
have
clung
to
us
because
they
were
so
aged
they
were
afraid
to
leave
just
mamma
edith
my
old
nurse
and
myself
it
seems
so
lonely
and
major
brennan
and
arthur
both
insist
it
is
no
longer
safe
so
they
are
coming
with
a
cavalry
escort
to
take
us
all
north
i
am
sure
we
shall
have
a
splendid
you
have
experienced
no
trouble
then
thus
far
oh
none
at
all
we
have
not
even
been
bothered
by
scouting
parties
oh
i
do
not
mean
you
you
are
no
bother
but
yesterday
there
was
a
horrible
man
here
he
came
to
the
kitchen
door
and
asked
all
sorts
of
impudent
questions
bungay
actually
had
to
threaten
him
with
a
gun
before
he
would
is
maria
bungay
here
then
why
certainly
do
you
know
her
is
she
a
delightful
old
dear
just
as
good
as
a
man
her
husband
is
with
my
jed
really
why
do
you
know
maria
has
got
it
into
her
head
that
he
had
run
away
from
her
i
should
so
love
to
witness
their
meeting
it
would
be
most
interesting
but
you
must
come
into
the
house
captain
wayne
edith
will
be
overjoyed
to
see
you
again
although
you
know
she
is
never
demonstrative
as
i
am
it
must
be
awfully
nice
to
be
always
cool
and
calm
do
you
think
determined
that
i
would
not
be
tempted
i
yet
hesitated
and
my
vivacious
companion
took
everything
for
granted
at
once
oh
before
we
go
in
wo
you
do
me
a
favor
she
asked
but
of
course
you
will
i
was
trying
to
tie
this
grapevine
into
place
when
you
surprised
me
but
i
could
not
hold
on
with
one
hand
and
tie
with
the
other
see
what
i
mean
and
placing
one
slender
foot
upon
a
slat
of
the
trellis
she
lifted
herself
up
until
she
could
barely
reach
the
refractory
branch
now
she
said
smiling
down
upon
me
please
just
hold
me
here
for
a
moment
until
i
secure
this
my
hand
was
scarcely
upon
her
in
support
when
the
slender
slat
snapped
beneath
her
weight
as
she
fell
i
caught
her
with
both
arms
for
a
moment
she
lay
panting
and
startled
on
my
breast
then
as
with
a
little
laugh
she
disengaged
herself
from
my
embrace
we
stood
there
hand
in
hand
and
face
to
face
with
edith
brennan
shall
i
ever
forget
the
look
within
her
eyes
how
plainly
i
saw
it
although
she
stood
half
hidden
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
vines
amazement
incredulity
scorn
were
expressed
there
yet
even
as
i
marked
them
all
became
merged
into
proud
unconsciousness
she
would
have
turned
away
without
a
word
but
my
companion
stopped
her
edith
she
cried
eagerly
do
you
not
see
this
is
captain
she
turned
toward
me
and
slightly
inclined
her
head
i
recognized
captain
wayne
was
her
calm
answer
and
regret
greatly
having
intruded
upon
him
it
was
entirely
unintentional
and
i
have
no
desire
to
i
could
not
have
spoken
at
that
moment
to
save
my
life
it
fairly
stunned
me
to
realize
the
construction
she
so
plainly
placed
upon
the
scene
just
enacted
not
so
the
girl
at
my
side
her
cheeks
flushed
with
indignation
and
her
audacity
gave
her
speech
which
made
matters
even
worse
than
before
you
are
exceedingly
free
with
your
criticisms
edith
she
exclaimed
sharply
as
the
latter
turned
her
back
upon
us
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
first
to
ascertain
the
you
wholly
mistake
was
the
calm
reply
i
have
not
presumed
to
criticise
why
should
i
it
is
not
a
matter
which
interests
me
in
the
least
i
presume
you
have
no
further
objection
to
my
returning
to
the
house
she
did
not
so
much
as
deign
to
look
again
at
either
of
us
but
as
she
moved
slowly
out
of
sight
miss
minor
turned
and
looked
into
my
face
with
questioning
eyes
what
she
may
have
read
there
i
know
not
but
she
sank
back
upon
a
bench
and
burst
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
is
it
perfectly
ridiculous
she
cried
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
speak
only
i
do
hope
she
wo
tell
chapter
xxviii
we
capture
a
courier
the
girl
light
burst
of
laughter
aroused
me
thoroughly
to
a
sense
of
our
situation
you
seem
to
derive
much
amusement
from
a
condition
of
affairs
almost
intolerable
to
me
i
said
bitterly
i
have
always
valued
most
highly
the
friendship
of
brennan
but
this
unfortunate
occurrence
will
doubtless
end
she
glanced
up
at
me
her
long
lashes
wet
but
her
dark
eyes
sparkling
with
mischief
oh
she
wo
care
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
she
exclaimed
indifferently
but
i
suppose
she
will
think
i
am
perfectly
horrid
well
i
do
care
if
she
does
she
might
have
waited
and
learned
the
truth
first
was
her
face
a
study
and
how
shall
i
ever
explain
to
arthur
so
that
he
will
understand
i
sure
i
have
got
the
worst
of
it
oh
captain
wayne
is
my
hair
all
ruffled
up
i
know
i
look
like
a
fright
you
must
come
in
now
and
we
will
explain
to
brennan
the
whole
matter
she
can
not
help
believing
us
both
while
i
know
she
would
be
so
cold
and
proud
with
me
i
shook
my
head
decisively
perhaps
it
was
better
ended
so
at
least
i
possessed
no
courage
just
then
to
face
her
indignation
she
might
but
deem
we
had
concocted
our
explanation
and
would
very
likely
receive
it
with
all
the
scorn
she
felt
it
deserved
besides
it
was
clear
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
to
aid
them
i
should
be
now
merely
an
unwelcome
intruder
an
escort
was
to
be
there
shortly
to
convoy
them
northward
and
for
me
to
be
found
in
their
company
by
brennan
would
only
inflame
him
and
add
greatly
to
the
embarrassment
of
his
wife
position
much
as
i
might
long
for
immediate
vindication
in
her
sight
the
plain
duty
of
true
love
was
to
depart
at
once
and
permit
time
to
straighten
out
the
tangle
you
must
pardon
me
i
hastened
to
say
standing
hat
in
hand
before
her
but
it
would
not
be
best
for
me
to
intrude
upon
brennan
after
her
late
reception
i
merely
halted
here
in
order
to
assure
myself
of
your
presence
and
safety
my
men
are
even
now
waiting
for
me
a
few
hundred
yards
but
i
wish
you
to
meet
oh
i
think
not
miss
minor
i
feel
warm
friendship
for
lieutenant
caton
but
we
wear
different
uniforms
serve
under
different
flags
and
a
meeting
here
both
with
armed
forces
behind
us
would
naturally
have
to
be
a
hostile
one
however
the
lieutenant
and
i
might
consent
to
a
temporary
truce
his
superior
officer
major
brennan
would
not
likely
prove
of
the
same
then
you
really
must
go
unless
you
specially
desire
to
witness
a
cavalry
skirmish
in
your
front
dooryard
i
certainly
consider
it
best
and
i
held
out
my
hand
surely
we
part
as
friends
and
i
may
hope
that
you
will
intercede
in
my
behalf
with
brennan
she
rose
up
impulsively
how
ridiculous
how
supremely
ridiculous
why
of
course
i
will
though
i
do
suppose
edith
really
cares
very
much
but
she
believed
it
would
be
highly
proper
to
be
shocked
i
do
think
she
likes
you
so
very
well
anyway
captain
wayne
for
she
never
will
talk
about
with
these
cheering
words
ringing
in
my
ears
and
feeling
thoroughly
defeated
in
every
cherished
hope
i
strode
savagely
down
the
long
hill
and
mounted
my
horse
how
roughly
fortune
had
buffeted
me
to
be
sure
and
how
extremely
small
the
inspiration
left
well
perhaps
i
deserved
it
for
ever
permitting
myself
to
love
one
whom
i
knew
to
be
the
wife
of
another
doubtless
she
had
seized
upon
this
slight
pretext
to
be
rid
of
me
and
was
already
rejoicing
over
its
easy
accomplishment
in
my
agitation
i
forgot
entirely
the
presence
of
maria
bungay
at
the
house
and
ordering
my
men
into
saddle
prepared
for
departure
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
little
fellow
and
his
domestic
troubles
i
chose
the
road
leading
toward
the
northwest
for
although
i
had
not
asked
the
question
i
conceived
it
highly
probable
that
brennan
and
his
party
would
ride
from
the
federal
cavalry
quarters
at
colter
church
and
i
had
no
desire
to
meet
them
they
were
upon
an
errand
of
mercy
of
far
greater
importance
than
my
revenge
as
we
swung
along
through
the
heavily
timbered
land
fringing
our
road
bungay
pressed
his
mule
into
a
trot
and
finally
succeeded
in
ranging
up
at
my
side
even
in
my
disturbed
mental
condition
i
was
amused
at
his
unique
style
of
riding
although
i
would
not
wound
him
by
laughing
i
say
cap
he
said
jerking
the
words
out
to
the
mule
hard
trot
and
grasping
his
saddle
pommel
desperately
i
sorter
reckon
as
how
ther
be
some
fun
back
thar
afore
long
all
signs
why
i
stared
at
him
now
thoroughly
aroused
to
the
thought
that
he
had
important
news
to
communicate
wal
he
explained
slowly
whin
ye
wint
off
i
sorter
tuk
a
notion
ter
look
a
bit
used
ter
be
an
ol
stompin
ground
o
mine
so
dutchy
an
me
clumb
thet
big
hill
back
o
whar
we
halted
an
by
gum
down
thar
in
ther
gully
on
t
other
side
thar
a
durned
big
camp
o
i
reined
up
short
and
with
uplifted
hand
signalled
the
men
behind
to
halt
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
i
questioned
sternly
how
many
were
there
and
what
did
they
look
like
he
scratched
the
back
of
his
head
thoughtfully
and
answered
with
careful
deliberation
durn
it
i
did
jine
ye
till
after
started
an
i
reckon
as
how
it
took
me
all
o
tew
mile
ter
git
this
yere
blame
muel
up
ter
whar
i
cud
talk
thar
quite
a
smart
bunch
but
they
hed
some
pickets
out
an
i
cud
git
close
ter
tell
zackly
dutchy
thought
thar
wus
nigh
onter
two
hunderd
o
but
i
jist
do
know
they
wus
dressed
like
sojers
o
either
army
an
i
reckon
they
out
o
ther
i
glanced
at
my
little
handful
of
men
scarcely
knowing
what
decision
it
might
be
wise
to
make
undoubtedly
they
would
fight
if
occasion
arose
but
the
odds
were
terribly
heavy
besides
if
brennan
came
and
his
party
got
away
that
same
evening
as
was
planned
for
them
to
do
then
it
might
not
be
necessary
for
us
to
strike
a
blow
i
was
certainly
in
no
mood
to
expose
my
small
command
merely
to
save
the
empty
house
from
destruction
ebers
i
said
turning
toward
the
sergeant
who
sat
his
horse
with
expressionless
face
you
were
with
the
guide
when
he
discovered
this
camp
how
many
do
you
think
it
contained
and
who
were
they
vel
dere
vos
more
as
two
gompanies
captain
und
dere
vos
some
horses
but
dey
vos
dressed
vot
you
calls
it
all
ober
not
der
not
in
uniform
dot
vos
have
any
of
the
rest
of
you
seen
anything
that
looked
suspicious
i
asked
glancing
around
into
the
different
faces
maybe
i
did
answered
one
of
the
troopers
named
earl
as
we
rode
up
the
first
hill
after
leaving
the
house
my
horse
picked
up
a
stone
and
i
had
to
stop
and
get
it
out
i
reckon
i
fell
behind
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
more
and
just
as
i
started
i
looked
back
and
a
party
of
ten
or
twelve
fellows
was
just
riding
in
through
them
big
gates
onto
the
front
lawn
but
them
fellows
was
soldiers
for
sure
they
rode
regular
like
and
all
of
them
wore
caps
it
was
so
far
off
i
could
tell
the
color
of
their
clothes
but
them
caps
made
me
think
they
was
i
chose
my
course
at
once
this
undoubtedly
must
have
been
party
thank
you
my
man
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
reported
that
to
me
at
once
i
said
however
i
understand
the
situation
much
better
now
sergeant
we
will
go
into
camp
here
post
pickets
in
both
directions
but
put
your
most
careful
men
on
that
hill
yonder
let
them
report
promptly
any
signs
of
fire
to
the
southeast
or
any
sound
of
we
completed
all
our
cooking
before
dark
and
when
the
night
finally
closed
down
about
us
it
proved
to
be
an
exceedingly
black
one
although
the
skies
were
clear
sleep
was
an
impossibility
for
me
as
my
mind
was
in
constant
turmoil
i
felt
hampered
prisoned
shut
in
unable
to
do
what
i
most
desired
i
wondered
where
she
was
probably
riding
northward
beside
her
husband
and
i
bit
my
lip
savagely
at
thought
of
it
possibly
she
was
even
then
laughing
merrily
in
memory
of
my
unfortunate
predicament
in
the
garden
so
she
cared
nothing
for
me
exhibited
her
indifference
clearly
in
presence
of
others
disliked
even
to
hear
my
name
mentioned
very
well
i
would
take
exceeding
good
care
never
again
to
intrude
myself
upon
her
then
my
thoughts
swerved
to
the
big
house
out
yonder
in
the
darkness
if
signs
of
attack
came
to
us
what
should
i
do
the
question
truly
puzzled
me
for
i
was
unwilling
to
expose
the
lives
of
my
men
merely
to
save
property
confederate
soldiers
were
far
too
valuable
at
that
stage
of
the
war
if
i
only
knew
positively
that
the
women
were
safely
away
i
would
tarry
no
longer
in
the
neighborhood
but
i
did
not
know
i
merely
hoped
ebers
was
lying
next
me
upon
the
grass
solemnly
puffing
at
his
huge
pipe
and
i
held
my
watch
to
the
glow
in
its
bowl
in
order
to
see
the
time
it
was
nearly
midnight
those
fellows
ought
to
be
at
it
before
this
i
said
to
him
if
they
intend
to
accomplish
anything
i
dink
so
too
he
answered
slowly
i
vill
see
dot
der
guard
is
all
right
an
den
vill
get
some
sleep
for
i
am
pretty
moch
done
op
he
arose
ponderously
to
his
feet
and
stretched
out
his
short
arms
in
a
prodigious
yawn
as
he
stood
there
his
pudgy
figure
outlined
against
the
sky
there
was
borne
to
our
ears
the
sound
of
a
furious
struggle
on
the
hilltop
to
the
south
a
shout
blows
a
volley
of
cursing
then
silence
an
instant
later
we
were
both
running
through
the
darkness
toward
the
scene
of
trouble
what
is
it
sands
i
questioned
breathlessly
as
i
came
suddenly
upon
the
little
group
a
fellar
on
hossback
was
the
answer
he
come
up
on
us
like
a
streak
out
o
thet
black
hollor
an
he
a
sure
got
away
of
mason
hed
clubbed
him
with
his
gun
i
got
the
cuss
safe
collared
who
are
you
i
asked
sternly
striving
in
vain
to
see
something
of
him
through
the
darkness
where
were
you
riding
he
maintained
a
sullen
silence
and
sands
kicked
him
none
of
that
i
commanded
ebers
strike
a
match
will
you
and
let
me
see
this
i
had
scarcely
spoken
when
our
prisoner
thrust
sands
roughly
aside
and
took
one
hasty
step
toward
me
my
god
wayne
is
it
possible
this
is
you
he
cried
excitedly
caton
i
exclaimed
as
surprised
as
himself
caton
what
is
it
what
is
wrong
am
i
to
do
dot
asked
the
sergeant
anxiously
no
i
answered
i
know
this
man
and
we
shall
need
no
fire
caton
are
you
from
the
minor
house
has
it
been
attacked
yes
he
answered
panting
yet
from
his
exertion
and
excitement
we
were
to
start
north
with
the
ladies
at
nine
but
the
house
was
surrounded
as
soon
as
it
became
dark
those
devils
supposed
it
to
be
unguarded
and
advanced
without
precautions
we
fired
and
drove
them
back
we
had
repulsed
three
attacks
when
i
left
at
eleven
but
three
of
our
men
were
already
you
were
after
aid
i
was
striving
to
reach
our
advance
pickets
at
mcmillan
it
seemed
the
only
possible
chance
and
none
of
the
men
would
volunteer
to
make
the
ride
one
was
killed
trying
it
before
i
started
god
knows
how
i
hated
to
leave
them
but
it
had
to
be
done
how
many
have
you
only
twenty
but
if
we
could
once
get
inside
along
with
your
fellows
we
might
hold
the
house
until
reinforcements
thank
god
i
knew
you
would
he
cried
joyfully
grasping
me
again
fervently
by
the
hand
you
are
not
one
to
hesitate
over
the
color
of
a
uniform
at
such
a
time
as
this
i
have
been
proud
all
through
this
war
to
feel
that
we
on
both
sides
were
of
the
same
blood
and
have
felt
like
cheering
your
gray
lines
more
than
once
only
wayne
and
he
hesitated
an
instant
it
is
right
i
should
tell
you
that
brennan
is
there
and
in
i
know
it
but
those
women
must
be
saved
nevertheless
i
answered
firmly
my
mind
settled
this
is
no
time
for
personal
quarrelling
and
whatever
color
of
cloth
we
wear
those
outlaws
are
our
common
enemies
to
be
hunted
down
like
wild
beasts
i
have
seen
specimens
of
their
fiendish
cruelty
that
make
my
blood
run
cold
to
remember
the
very
thought
of
those
who
are
now
exposed
falling
into
such
hands
is
enough
to
craze
one
death
would
be
preferable
a
thousand
times
how
many
fighting
men
have
you
seven
fit
for
will
you
ride
forward
or
go
back
with
us

the

a
mere
boy
with
freckled

and
great
honest
gray
eyes
but
wiry
and
tough
as
steel
pushed
his
way
through
the
group
and
faced

most

helpless
women

entirely
upon

to
the
commandant
of

is
a
matter
of
humanity
the
federal
outpost
at
mcmillan
is
the
nearest

for
there

boy

and

in
plenty
of
time
to
take
a
hand
my
lad
now
men
and
i
turned
to
the
dark
expectant
ring
about
me
this
is
no
ordinary
duty
of
your
enlistment
and
i
wish
no
one
to
accompany
me
who
does
not
volunteer
for
the
service
seven
federal
soldiers
and
four
women
three
of
them
virginians

attacked
at

by
a
large
party
of
bushwhacking
guerillas
the
offscourings
of
hell
every
one
of
you
knows
what
that
means
will
you
go
with
me
to
their
rescue
no
one
seemed
anxious
to
be
first
to
speak
i
could
see
them
look
aside
uneasily
at
one
another
bungay
i
said
i
feel
sure

will
go
for
your
wife

mariar
yes
miss
minor
told
me
this
afternoon
but
i
had
forgotten
to
mention
the
little
man
sprang
into
the
air
and
came
down
with
a
whoop
the
bloody
devils
he
cried
excitedly
ye
bet
i
come
sergeant
speak
up
what
do
you
men
say
i
like

he

but

we
with
you
sir
spoke
voice
after
voice
gravely
around
the
dark
circle
and
then
sands
added
we
show
them
thar
yanks
how
the
johnny
rebs
kin
fight
ten
minutes
later
glen
bearing
his
two
messages
to
the
blue
and
gray
was
speeding
recklessly
through
the
black
night
northward
while
my
little
squad
was
moving
cautiously
back
over
the
road
we
had
so
lately
traversed
chapter
xxix
a
mission
for
beelzebub
as
we
picked
our
way
slowly
forward
through
the
gloom
i
gleaned
from
caton
all
he
knew
regarding
the
situation
before
us
my
own
knowledge
of
the
environments
of
the
minor
house
helped
me
greatly
to
appreciate
the
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
he
had
succeeded
in
his
escape
by
dodging
among
the
negro
cabins
where
the
attacking
line
appeared
weakest
but
expressed
the
conviction
that
even
this
slight
gap
would
be
securely
closed
long
before
we
reached
there
have
they
sufficient
men
then
to
cover
thoroughly
all
four
sides
i
asked
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
there
must
be
fully
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
gang
and
apparently
they
operate
under
strict
military
discipline
it
is
a
revelation
to
me
wayne
of
the
growing
power
of
these
desperate
fellows
i
knew
they
were
becoming
numerous
and
bold
but
this
surpasses
anything
i
could
imagine
more
they
are
being
constantly
recruited
by
new
arrivals
a
party
of
at
least
a
dozen
came
in
while
i
was
hiding
behind
the
stables
i
heard
them
asking
for
the
what
did
they
call
him
lory
or
laurie
something
like
that
they
claimed
to
be
deserters
from
lee
army
but
two
or
three
of
them
wore
our
it
red
lowrie
i
said
gravely
more
impressed
than
ever
with
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
i
heard
of
him
two
years
ago
he
killed
a
man
in
the
sixth
north
carolina
and
took
to
the
hills
since
then
he
has
developed
into
quite
a
leader
for
such
scum
and
has
proven
himself
a
merciless
monster
you
have
no
suggestion
to
offer
as
to
how
we
had
better
attempt
to
get
in
he
shook
his
head
despondingly
what
station
does
brennan
defend
i
asked
the
front
of
the
house
the
main
point
of
attack
has
been
we
could
distinguish
the
sound
of
firing
by
this
time
and
its
continuous
volume
convinced
me
that
caton
estimate
of
the
number
engaged
was
not
greatly
overdrawn
as
we
topped
the
summit
of
the
hill
a
great
burst
of
red
fire
leaped
suddenly
high
into
the
sky
great
god
wayne
we
are
too
late
he
cried
wildly
those
devils
have
fired
the
with
fiercely
throbbing
heart
i
gazed
down
at
the
flames
far
below
in
the
black
valley
no
i
said
with
eager
relief
it
is
the
stable
which
is
ablaze
see
the
light
falls
full
upon
the
white
sides
of
the
house
thank
heaven
we
are
not
too
as
i
sat
my
horse
there
gazing
down
upon
that
scene
of
black
rapine
unwilling
to
venture
into
its
midst
until
i
could
formulate
some
definite
plan
of
action
fully
a
dozen
wild
schemes
thronged
into
my
brain
only
to
be
cast
aside
one
after
another
as
thoroughly
impracticable
we
shall
have
to
make
a
dash
for
it
and
trust
in
god
said
caton
guessing
at
my
dilemma
no
i
answered
firmly
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
success
in
such
a
course
those
fellows
are
old
hands
and
have
pickets
out
see
caton
that
is
certainly
a
yonder
where
the
road
dips
every
man
of
us
would
be
shot
down
before
we
penetrated
those
guard
lines
and
attained
the
house
we
have
got
to
reach
their
inner
line
someway
through
strategy
and
even
then
must
risk
being
fired
upon
by
our
own
people
before
we
get
within
even
as
i
was
speaking
i
evolved
a
plan
of
action
desperate
it
certainly
was
yet
nothing
better
occurred
to
me
and
time
was
golden
ebers
i
said
did
i
see
an
extra
jacket
strapped
back
of
your
saddle
it
is
no
good
he
protested
vehemently
it
vos
for
der
rain
all
right
hand
it
over
to
the
lieutenant
here
caton
throw
that
uniform
coat
of
yours
into
the
ditch
and
don
honest
gray
for
once
sands
come
here
take
your
knife
and
cut
away
every
symbol
of
rank
on
my
jacket
tear
it
off
any
way
you
in
another
moment
these
necessary
changes
had
been
accomplished
now
i
ordered
pile
your
sabres
there
with
mine
beside
the
road
then
hobble
your
horses
all
but
the
mule
i
shall
want
does
we
go
der
rest
of
der
vay
on
foot
questioned
the
sergeant
anxiously
certainly
and
i
desire
you
to
remember
one
important
thing
let
me
do
the
talking
but
if
any
of
you
are
asked
questions
we
are
deserters
from
hills
corps
tired
of
the
mein
gott
muttered
the
german
disconsolately
i
hope
it
vos
not
long
off
captain
i
am
no
good
on
foot
in
der
dark
by
you
had
better
manage
to
keep
up
unless
you
are
seeking
to
commit
suicide
now
men
mark
me
carefully
load
your
carbines
are
you
all
ready
sergeant
see
that
each
man
has
his
gun
properly
charged
and
capped
you
are
to
carry
your
arms
as
thoroughly
concealed
as
possible
keep
close
to
me
always
obey
my
orders
instantly
and
to
the
letter
we
are
but
twenty
men
pitted
against
over
two
hundred
remember
and
when
we
strike
it
must
be
both
quick
and
i
mounted
the
mule
counted
the
dim
figures
in
the
darkness
and
then
gave
the
order
to
march
as
we
moved
slowly
down
the
hill
i
was
aware
that
caton
walked
upon
one
side
of
me
while
bungay
plodded
along
upon
the
other
but
my
mind
was
so
filled
with
the
excitement
of
our
adventure
and
all
that
depended
upon
its
successful
culmination
as
scarcely
to
realize
anything
other
than
the
part
i
must
personally
play
good
fortune
and
audacity
alone
could
combine
to
win
the
game
we
were
now
engaged
upon
a
tall
heavily
bearded
mountaineer
stood
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
road
to
the
north
of
the
i
could
make
but
little
of
him
as
the
light
shone
excepting
that
he
wore
a
high
coonskin
cap
and
bore
a
long
rifle
stop
right
thar
he
called
out
hoarsely
upon
hearing
us
who
are
you
uns
as
he
challenged
a
dozen
others
sprang
up
from
about
the
flame
and
guns
in
hand
came
toward
us
on
a
run
we
uns
are
doggoned
tired
o
soldierin
an
a
gittin
nuthin
fer

i
said
in
the
slow
southern
drawl
an
wanter
jine
yer
gang
thar
any
show
fer
how
many
are
ye
asked
one
of
the
newcomers
striding
forward
between
us
and
the
sentry
a
right
smart
heap
o
a
bunch
bin
a
pickin
o
up
ever
since
we
left

returned
evasively

yere
gang
an
if
thet
ther
way
o
it
i
reckon
as
how
it
lowrie
we
after
be
you
lowrie
the
answer
was
so
gruff
and
short
and
the
fellow
hesitated
so
long
in
adding
anything
to
it
i
began
to
think
it
was
all
off
wal
he
consented
to
say
at
last
ungraciously
thar
a
blame
pile
o
ye
kim
in
lately
an
i
calcalate
we
got
fer
our
business
but
i
reckon

diskiver

ornerest
man

now

run
up
agin
he
plum
mad
red
is
fer
he
turned
and
strode
off
without
so
much
as
giving
us
a
backward
glance
and
with
a
hearty
congratulatory
kick
to
the
mule
i
and
my
company
followed
him
a
hundred
yards
further
in
we
passed
through
the
fringe
of
trees
and
emerged
into
an
open
space
from
whence
we
could
see
plainly
the
great
white
house
still
illumined
by
the
flames
which
continued
to
consume
the
stables
shots
were
flashing
like
fireflies
out
of
the
darkness
on
every
side
of
us
the
smell
of
burning
powder
scented
the
air
and
i
could
distinguish
the
black
forms
of
men
lying
prone
on
the
grass
in
something
resembling
a
skirmish
line
makin
a
fight
o
it
ai
they
i
asked
of
our
taciturn
guide
as
we
picked
our
way
carefully
among
the
recumbent
forms
damn
yes
a
hell
o
a
fight
he
admitted
bitterly
reckoned
we
hed
a
soft
job
yere
an
lots
o
ther
stuff
fer
ther
boys
they
got
some
yanks
in
thar

out
then

out

fule
question
he
hev
them
yanks
now
if
it
wur
ter
cost
every
man
he
got
he
ai
no
quitter
red
just
beyond
from
the
house
and
nearly
opposite
the
front
entrance
quite
a
group
of
men
were
standing
beneath
the
black
shadows
of
a
grove
of
trees
in
spite
of
the
gleam
from
the
fire
i
could
make
little
of
them
but
as
we
approached
from
the
direction
of
the
rear
one
of
them
exclaimed
suddenly
who
comes
thar
what
body
o
men
is
thet
it
party
o
deserters
as
wants

said
the
guide
sourly
they
johnnies
from
lee
oh

reckon
and
the
speaker
strode
forward
with
a
rough
mirthless
laugh
wal
damn
they
will

i
done
we
a
goin
ter
rush

bellies
full
who

o

crowd
i
swung
down
from
my
seat
on
the
mule
back
and
stood
facing
him
we
uns
hai
got
no
boss
i
answered
but
they
sorter
fell
in
ahind
o
me
i
wus
astraddle
o
this
muel
be
you
named
lowrie
i
reckon
i
red
lowrie
proudly
maybe
ye
heerd
tell
me
an
if
ye
hev
ye
know
ye
got
ter
step
damn
lively
whin
i
howl
whut
wus
ye
in
ther
army
the
flames
of
the
burning
barn
leaped
suddenly
upward
as
if
fed
by
some
fresh
combustion
and
flung
a
brighter
glare
over
the
rough
faces
clustered
about
us
i
saw
red
lowrie
plainly
enough
now
as
he
peered
eagerly
forward
to
scan
my
face
a
man
with
prominent
nose
and
thick
matted
red
beard
he
wore
a
soft
army
hat
under
which
his
eyes
shone
maliciously
and
he
grasped
a
long
rifle
in
one
big
hairy
hand
as
i
gazed
at
him
curiously
some
one
hastily
pushed
a
way
through
the
group
at
his
back
and
the
next
instant
a
tall
figure
stood
at
his
side
i
recognized
the
newcomer
at
a
single
glance
and
for
the
moment
my
heart
fairly
choked
me
it
was
craig
lowrie
he
said
pointing
straight
at
me
thar
somethin
wrong
yere
that
feller
thar
is
captain
wayne
o
my
ol
all
that
occurred
next
was
but
the
impulse
of
a
second
i
stood
with
hand
resting
lightly
upon
the
mule
neck
his
long
head
drooping
sleepily
beside
my
shoulder
i
saw
red
lowrie
throw
up
his
gun
all
his
evil
nature
written
in
his
face
his
cruel
eyes
instantly
aflame
with
anger
and
inspired
by
the
desperation
of
our
case
i
stooped
suddenly
and
blew
with
all
my
force
into
that
long
pendant
ear
beelzebub
gave
vent
to
one
snort
of
mingled
rage
and
terror
and
then
let
drive
backing
into
that
cluster
of
choice
rascals
like
a
very
thunderbolt
of
wrath
cleaving
his
way
by
every
lightning
blow
of
those
nimble
legs
and
tumbling
men
to
right
and
left
there
was
a
yell
of
fright
a
wild
scramble
for
safety
a
perfect
volley
of
cursing
i
saw
red
lowrie
go
tumbling
backward
a
heel
planted
fairly
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
the
next
instant
craig
swearing
like
a
pirate
was
jammed
down
on
top
of
him
a
red
gash
across
his
forehead
it
was
all
accomplished
so
speedily
that
it
seemed
but
a
medley
of
heels
of
wildly
cavorting
mule
of
scrambling
falling
men
fire
i
cried
excitedly
sock
it
into
them
lads
and
follow
me
there
was
a
quick
outburst
of
flame
a
thunderous
report
and
without
waiting
to
see
or
hear
more
i
sprang
forward
through
the
dense
smoke
and
raced
madly
toward
the
front
door
caton
panted
at
my
side
and
i
could
hear
the
heavy
feet
of
a
score
of
men
pounding
the
turf
behind
us
the
rush
was
so
rapid
the
noise
so
great
and
confusing
i
could
not
distinguish
whether
we
were
even
fired
upon
from
the
rear
but
i
marked
a
red
flash
at
one
of
the
windows
in
our
front
and
heard
behind
me
a
sharp
wail
of
agony
if
any
man
drops
pick
him
up
i
called
and
at
that
moment
we
sprang
up
the
steps
and
began
pounding
loudly
against
the
door
open
up
shouted
the
lieutenant
anxiously
brennan
open
up
quick
it

thought
it
never
would
open
a
volley
crashed
into
us
and
sands
pitched
down
upon
his
face
clutching
at
the
man
next
him
as
he
fell
i
glanced
back
anxiously
a
dark
confused
mass
of
men
without
military
formation
were
running
across
the
open
space
toward
us
face
i
shouted
load
at
will
fire
we
poured
one
scattering
volley
into
them
it
halted
their
movement
for
a
moment
and
then
the
door
opened
a
scant
crack
is
this
you
caton
yes
for
god
sake
open
up
the
heavy
door
swung
slowly
inward
and
with
a
wild
rush
to
be
first
we
surged
headlong
into
the
hall
chapter
xxx
a
union
of
yank
and
reb
as
the
heavy
door
clanged
behind
us
some
one
upon
the
outside
began
pounding
upon
it
while
with
deadly
chug
a
bullet
crashed
into
the
oaken
panel
donnerwetter
shouted
a
deep
voice
wildly
captain
i
am
yet
out
mit
der
with
a
crash
i
flung
aside
the
thick
iron
bar
which
answered
as
a
lock
and
drew
in
the
sergeant
yet
panting
heavily
from
his
hard
run
by
chiminy
dot
vas
a
narrow
squeak
he
exclaimed
as
i
released
my
grasp
upon
him
and
hurled
the
door
back
into
its
place
a
dim
light
swinging
suspended
from
the
ceiling
of
the
great
wide
hall
revealed
clearly
the
scene
within
as
i
turned
i
beheld
brennan
for
the
first
time
and
his
face
remains
a
memory
standing
with
his
back
to
the
a
revolver
grasped
tightly
in
either
hand
his
eyes
burning
his
countenance
flushed
with
anger
and
clouded
by
doubt
he
appeared
almost
like
one
distracted
at
sight
of
me
he
gave
up
all
attempt
to
control
his
raging
temper
what
does
all
this
mean
he
demanded
hoarsely
who
are
these
men
caton
if
you
have
betrayed
us
by
god
i
will
shoot
you
there
is
no
betrayal
returned
the
lieutenant
coolly
these
men
are
friends
he
laughed
cynically
friends
in
that
uniform
and
you
attired
in
a
rebel
cavalry
jacket
friends
that
fellow
over
there
and
he
pointed
derisively
at
me
with
his
pistol
barrel
damn
you
but
i
believe
you
are
all
a
pack
of
lying
thieves
caton
face
burned
he
took
one
step
toward
him
his
hands
clinched
and
when
he
spoke
his
clear
voice
shook
with
intense
indignation
major
brennan
he
said
coldly
deliberate
you
are
my
superior
officer
but
you
go
beyond
all
privilege
of
rank
in
those
words
i
say
these
men
are
friends
they
have
sunk
the
issues
of
war
in
order
that
they
may
answer
the
call
of
humanity
if
you
dare
impeach
my
motives
any
further
i
shall
hurl
back
the
cowardly
insult
in
your
face
i
will
take
no
such
words
sir
from
any
living
brennan
looked
at
him
his
lips
struggling
with
the
utterance
that
would
not
come
knowing
well
the
danger
of
such
delay
i
hastily
pushed
aside
the
ring
of
men
and
fronted
him
determined
to
end
this
foolishness
then
and
there
major
brennan
i
said
firmly
ignoring
his
efforts
to
silence
me
you
must
listen
to
reason
whether
you
wish
to
do
so
or
not
my
troopers
are
all
around
you
i
have
two
men
to
your
one
in
this
house
and
can
enforce
my
will
if
necessary
now
mark
what
i
say
we
are
not
here
in
anger
or
in
war
but
to
help
you
in
the
protection
of
endangered
women
we
captured
your
courier
have
despatched
one
of
our
own
number
into
the
federal
camp
for
aid
and
have
fought
our
way
in
here
to
stand
beside
you
and
your
men
in
defence
of
this
house
against
those
ruffians
without
you
can
use
us
or
not
just
as
you
please
it
rests
with
you
to
say
whether
we
shall
be
comrades
in
arms
on
this
occasion
or
whether
i
shall
assume
command
by
the
power
of
force
which
i
chance
to
he
seemed
utterly
unable
to
grasp
my
full
meaning
to
comprehend
the
situation
you
mean
you
would
fight
with
us
under
my
command
he
asked
incredulously
i
offer
my
services
under
your
orders
i
replied
clearly
and
these
men
in
gray
will
obey
i
actually
thought
he
would
extend
his
hand
but
some
remembrance
suddenly
restrained
him
i
of
course
captain
wayne
he
stammered
at
length
i
i
must
accept
your
offer
i
i
am
grateful
for
it
but
i
shall
insist
upon
one
thing
there
must
be
a
final
settlement
of
the
personal
matter
existing
between
us
i
am
not
willing
to
waive
my
rights
in
there
is
no
occasion
for
your
doing
so
sir
i
answered
coldly
for
i
considered
the
reference
at
that
moment
in
extremely
ill
taste
when
our
work
here
has
been
accomplished
you
will
find
me
very
much
at
your
he
bowed
gravely
i
am
exceedingly
glad
we
understand
each
other
he
said
may
i
ask
the
size
of
your
command
sergeant
i
questioned
whom
have
we
lost
nelson
vos
kilt
i
dinks
der
kid
is
not
here
yet
und
sands
vos
vounded
very
well
then
major
brennan
i
tender
you
sixteen
men
fit
for
duty
besides
myself
you
are
doubtless
acquainted
with
the
house
and
can
assign
us
to
positions
where
our
services
will
prove
of
greatest
he
had
completely
recovered
his
by
this
time
and
spoke
now
with
the
terse
sentences
of
a
tried
soldier
i
thank
you
captain
wayne
and
will
ask
you
to
choose
four
men
and
assume
command
of
the
east
side
of
the
house
caton
you
will
take
the
same
number
for
defence
of
the
rear
captain
what
is
your
name
ebers
an
experienced
german
i
should
have
suspected
his
nationality
let
him
have
command
of
four
more
and
cover
the
west
windows
i
shall
defend
the
front
myself
as
i
have
been
very
well
i
answered
shortly
for
his
eyes
had
remained
fixed
upon
me
all
the
time
he
was
talking
take
the
positions
assigned
you
lads
and
do
not
permit
a
man
from
without
to
put
foot
on
the
veranda
if
they
once
succeed
in
getting
under
cover
of
the
porch
roof
they
will
give
us
plenty
of
they
have
remained
remarkably
quiet
since
you
came
in
interposed
the
major
even
my
men
seem
to
see
nothing
to
shoot
probably
they
have
recovered
as
yet
from
our
little
surprise
party
i
said
with
a
smile
of
remembrance
we
left
a
mule
out
there
who
will
entertain
them
for
some
time
unless
they
adopt
heroic
the
position
for
defence
assigned
to
my
care
took
me
into
the
of
the
mansion
a
spacious
almost
square
apartment
containing
three
large
windows
reaching
nearly
to
the
floor
the
outside
blinds
had
been
closed
but
the
glass
in
the
panes
was
mostly
broken
and
there
were
other
evidences
that
the
firing
had
been
both
heavy
and
continuous
i
found
two
soldiers
of
brennan
party
within
both
lying
upon
the
floor
and
peering
cautiously
through
the
apertures
of
the
blinds
they
glanced
up
at
us
with
undisguised
amazement
it
all
right
lads
i
said
heartily
never
mind
our
colors
we
are
all
fighting
the
same
i
had
taken
with
me
bungay
together
with
three
of
my
troopers
and
after
placing
them
as
advantageously
as
possible
i
stretched
myself
out
on
the
floor
and
applying
an
eye
to
a
convenient
opening
took
careful
survey
of
the
situation
without
there
was
little
to
be
observed
for
darkness
securely
hid
the
movements
of
the
enemy
everything
upon
our
side
of
the
house
however
appeared
comparatively
quiet
yet
it
was
clearly
evident
that
the
besiegers
had
no
present
intention
of
withdrawing
from
the
attack
the
flame
of
the
stables
had
already
largely
died
away
but
what
little
light
remained
enabled
me
to
perceive
unmistakable
signs
of
their
presence
i
could
distinguish
frequent
moving
figures
in
the
background
but
was
unable
to
determine
their
distance
from
the
house
occasionally
a
flash
out
of
the
night
would
evidence
the
discharge
of
a
gun
and
i
heard
a
gruff
voice
shouting
forth
an
order
one
shot
struck
the
window
just
above
me
showering
my
shoulders
with
fragments
of
broken
glass
and
i
noticed
one
of
the
federal
soldiers
in
the
room
carried
his
arm
in
a
rude
sling
this
present
cessation
of
activity
was
i
felt
convinced
only
temporary
i
did
not
expect
from
all
i
could
now
see
that
the
final
assault
would
take
place
upon
my
side
of
the
building
the
massing
of
the
main
body
of
the
besiegers
before
the
front
entrance
together
with
the
presence
there
of
their
leaders
was
sufficient
to
convince
me
that
this
was
to
prove
the
principal
point
of
attack
and
from
my
knowledge
of
such
affairs
i
decided
that
probably
the
first
signs
of
returning
daylight
would
be
the
signal
for
a
determined
assault
the
dark
interior
of
such
a
house
as
this
offered
too
many
defensive
advantages
which
the
daylight
would
largely
overcome
have
you
had
some
hard
fighting
i
asked
of
the
man
lying
next
me
a
fellow
wearing
the
yellow
chevrons
of
a
corporal
of
cavalry
they
pitched
in
mighty
strong
at
first
sir
he
answered
civilly
we
had
so
few
men
they
pretty
nearly
rushed
us
fer
sure
it
was
our
repeatin
rifles
thet
drove
you
suffered
to
some
extent
two
killed
sir
and
three
or
four
wounded
it
wus
hot
fer
a
while
i
tell
you
as
lively
a
little
jig
as
i
ever
bin
in
mcneal
there
got
a
lump
of
lead
in
his
arm
would
you
mind
explainin
you
fellows
comin
in
here
to
help
us
sir
it
seems
kinder
odd
to
be
fightin
longside
of
i
told
him
briefly
the
circumstances
and
his
eyes
danced
merrily
at
the
recital
be
a
rum
story
to
tell
if
ever
we
get
out
of
here
sir
he
commented
patting
his
gun
i
mostly
seen
you
fellows
from
the
side
but
dern
it
all
this
is
more
the
way
it
ought
to
i
agreed
with
him
thoroughly
as
to
that
and
we
relapsed
into
silence
each
intent
upon
the
uncertainty
without
as
i
lay
there
gazing
anxiously
into
the
darkness
i
could
not
forbear
wondering
where
brennan
had
concealed
the
women
to
keep
them
from
harm
would
he
inform
them
of
our
arrival
he
could
scarcely
hope
to
keep
the
fact
long
hidden
for
they
would
certainly
see
some
of
my
and
ask
questions
i
doubted
however
if
he
would
mention
my
name
yet
caton
surely
would
and
caton
could
not
be
kept
long
away
from
miss
minor
unless
serious
attack
was
imminent
unquestionably
i
should
be
compelled
to
meet
them
before
this
duty
was
concluded
how
should
i
be
received
and
how
should
i
conduct
myself
there
was
but
one
way
a
dignified
courtesy
seemingly
ignoring
all
that
had
previously
occurred
any
explanation
at
present
was
apparently
out
of
the
question
and
i
certainly
could
not
venture
to
intrude
after
the
coldness
of
my
last
reception
besides
there
was
brennan
to
be
considered
he
would
make
use
of
my
services
in
this
emergency
but
i
had
been
distinctly
informed
it
could
make
no
difference
in
the
feud
existing
between
us
i
had
no
wish
that
it
should
and
i
could
consistently
hope
for
very
little
consideration
from
the
wife
of
a
man
whom
i
was
destined
to
meet
upon
the
field
of
honor
no
the
far
better
way
was
to
see
as
little
of
her
as
possible
to
meet
almost
as
strangers
and
then
to
part
for
ever
difficult
as
this
programme
assuredly
was
it
seemed
the
only
honorable
course
left
me
even
had
she
loved
me
as
truly
as
i
did
her
i
could
yet
do
no
less
they
seem
to
be
peckin
away
pretty
lively
out
in
front
said
the
corporal
interrupting
my
reverie
yes
i
admitted
in
my
judgment
that
will
prove
the
main
point
of
attack
how
many
men
did
the
major
have
there
before
we
came
same
as
here
and
four
of
mine
that
makes
seven
altogether
counting
himself
and
two
of
these
ought
to
be
posted
in
the
upper
story
he
bound
to
need
more
that
firing
is
very
he
got
the
women
loadin
for
him
and
that
helps
the
women
i
asked
staring
at
him
in
amazement
do
you
mean
to
say
brennan
and
celia
minor
are
there
in
that
front
room
do
know
who
they
are
sir
two
mighty
fine
lookin
young
ladies
an
old
lady
with
white
hair
an
a
big
female
sir
the
last
one
wus
handlin
a
gun
to
beat
the
band
just
afore
you
and
he
keeps
them
there
exposed
to
all
this
heavy
fire
what
can
the
man
mean
why
corporal
that
constant
shooting
must
have
completely
shattered
the
windows
there
could
be
no
safety
for
any
one
except
lying
flat
upon
the
well
aint
quite
so
bad
as
that
sir
he
protested
seemingly
anxious
to
shield
his
officer
from
adverse
criticism
you
see
it
a
double
parlor
with
a
wall
an
foldin
doors
atween
an
the
women
are
all
in
the
rear
room
of
course
it
almighty
dark
back
there
an
they
has
to
lie
pretty
close
but
blamed
if
i
know
of
any
better
place
for
them
this
house
hai
got
no
it
certainly
was
not
my
place
to
interfere
her
husband
was
the
one
who
should
be
most
solicitous
as
to
her
safety
yet
it
worried
me
greatly
to
think
of
edith
brennan
lying
helpless
in
the
dark
exposed
to
constant
danger
with
the
deadly
rifles
crackling
all
about
her
surely
somewhere
in
this
great
house
there
would
be
an
interior
apartment
where
greater
protection
could
be
assured
doubtless
brennan
was
unwilling
to
have
them
away
from
him
possibly
he
even
continued
to
hold
them
where
they
were
to
prevent
all
possibility
of
their
meeting
with
me
it
was
this
last
thought
improbable
as
it
surely
was
which
put
me
on
my
mettle
if
that
was
has
little
scheme
and
to
my
suspicion
it
looked
like
it
i
was
not
unwilling
to
play
a
hand
in
the
game
i
might
not
hold
trumps
yet
i
could
bluff
as
well
as
any
one
i
had
barely
arrived
at
this
point
in
my
musing
when
opportunity
for
action
came
a
man
groped
his
way
in
from
the
lighted
hall
but
halted
close
beside
the
door
unable
to
perceive
us
in
the
darkness
is
captain
wayne
here
he
asked
yes
what
is
it
major
brennan
has
had
two
of
his
men
hit
sir
and
wishes
you
to
spare
him
three
of
yours
unless
you
are
hotly
all
right
there
nothing
doing
here
i
answered
instantly
determining
upon
my
course
corporal
i
shall
leave
you
in
command
of
this
side
for
a
few
minutes
i
believe
i
can
be
of
more
immediate
value
elsewhere
bungay
you
and
elliott
come
with
the
lower
hall
having
no
windows
in
it
was
the
only
safe
place
in
the
building
and
here
a
light
had
been
kept
burning
the
door
which
as
i
judged
must
lead
into
the
back
parlor
was
closed
and
fastened
upon
the
inside
at
least
it
refused
to
yield
to
my
hand
when
tried
another
in
front
stood
very
slightly
ajar
report
to
brennan
i
whispered
into
jed
ear
and
forget
to
mention
i
am
with
you
i
desire
to
investigate
matters
for
myself
a
few
he
nodded
to
intimate
that
he
understood
and
then
we
crept
one
at
a
time
into
the
front
apartment
hugging
the
floor
closely
to
keep
beneath
the
range
of
the
bullets
which
swept
every
now
and
then
through
the
broken
windows
and
chugged
into
the
wall
behind
us
i
was
the
last
to
wriggle
in
through
the
narrow
opening
and
rolling
instantly
out
of
the
tiny
bar
of
light
i
lay
silent
for
a
moment
endeavoring
to
get
my
bearings
i
was
determined
upon
just
one
thing
to
obtain
speech
with
the
women
learn
if
possible
their
exact
situation
and
if
i
found
it
necessary
insist
upon
their
better
protection
an
insane
jealousy
of
me
should
not
continue
to
expose
them
to
unnecessary
peril
brennan
was
directly
across
the
room
from
where
i
lay
i
could
hear
his
voice
issuing
low
stern
orders
if
you
only
keep
down
you
safe
enough
he
said
gruffly
there
has
a
shot
come
within
a
foot
of
the
sill
the
ground
slopes
out
yonder
and
those
fellows
ca
fire
low
put
the
new
men
at
the
central
window
and
let
them
shoot
at
every
flash
they
see
bradley
will
pass
back
their
empty
i
wondered
how
long
our
supply
of
ammunition
would
hold
out
with
such
a
fusillade
kept
up
but
ventured
upon
no
protest
for
i
was
already
groping
my
way
through
the
darkness
along
the
inner
wall
furniture
lay
overturned
in
every
direction
and
i
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
making
progress
through
the
debris
without
attracting
attention
a
great
square
piano
stood
directly
across
the
entrance
to
the
back
parlor
left
by
the
drawing
nearly
together
of
the
sliding
doors
i
waited
until
bradley
had
crawled
through
with
an
armful
of
loaded
guns
and
then
entered
also
creeping
silently
between
the
piano
legs
as
i
did
so
a
bullet
struck
the
case
above
me
and
the
whole
instrument
trembled
to
the
impact
giving
forth
a
strange
moan
as
if
in
pain
some
one
was
groaning
in
the
corner
at
my
left
and
supposing
the
wounded
to
be
lying
there
i
turned
more
toward
the
right
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
the
wall
hopeful
i
might
come
in
contact
with
one
of
the
women
i
do
not
honestly
know
why
i
did
this
really
i
had
no
excuse
except
my
natural
distrust
of
brennan
coupled
with
an
eager
desire
to
be
of
service
to
the
woman
of
my
heart
there
was
little
to
guide
me
in
the
search
as
the
flame
of
the
discharging
rifles
did
not
penetrate
here
once
i
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
while
a
faint
sound
of
whispering
reached
me
from
the
rear
of
the
room
then
my
hand
groping
blindly
along
the
wall
touched
the
lower
fold
of
a
dress
it
felt
like
coarse
calico
to
my
fingers
mrs
bungay
i
whispered
cautiously
is
this
you
the
woman
started
at
sound
of
my
voice
but
replied
in
the
same
low
tone
thet
my
name
who
mought
ye
be
a
friend
of
yours
and
of
your
husband
i
answered
for
i
doubted
if
she
would
recall
my
name
did
you
know
jed
was
here
my
man
hiven
be
praised
but
i
knock
ther
head
off
ther
little
divil
if
ever
i
git
my
hand
on
him
i
will
thet
whar
ther
little
imp
bin
all
ther
time
hunting
for
you
and
crying
his
eyes
out
i
answered
smiling
to
myself
in
the
darkness
where
is
brennan
jist
beyond
me
thar
in
ther
as
she
spoke
a
bullet
whizzed
past
us
having
missed
the
obstruction
of
the
piano
i
could
feel
the
wind
stirred
by
its
passage
while
its
peculiar
hum
told
me
it
was
a
minié
ball
you
are
too
far
out
from
the
wall
i
protested
you
are
in
ca
help
it
if
i
be
i
yere
ter
take
ther
guns
from
ther
sojer
an
pass
i
crept
slowly
along
beyond
her
keeping
close
to
the
wall
but
had
progressed
hardly
more
than
a
couple
of
yards
when
i
felt
a
hand
lightly
touch
me
i
recognize
your
voice
said
a
soft
whisper
and
am
so
glad
you
are
who
can
guess
the
motives
that
inspire
a
woman
this
was
my
welcome
where
i
had
anticipated
coldness
and
repellant
pride
chapter
xxxi
a
conversation
in
the
dark
in
my
extreme
surprise
at
the
intimate
cordiality
expressed
by
her
words
and
manner
i
failed
in
utterance
anticipating
coldness
indifference
possibly
even
resentment
at
my
presuming
to
approach
her
i
was
instead
greeted
by
an
unstudied
warmth
of
welcome
that
made
my
heart
beat
fiercely
surely
i
am
not
mistaken
she
questioned
rendered
doubtful
by
my
silence
is
not
this
captain
wayne
there
is
no
mistake
i
hastened
to
assure
her
but
i
had
anticipated
from
our
last
meeting
a
far
less
cordial
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
light
laugh
and
is
that
all
yet
surely
if
i
was
to
believe
my
own
eyes
i
was
perfectly
justified
in
my
actions
then
however
captain
i
have
been
forced
to
realize
the
truth
of
that
situation
and
am
now
disposed
to
make
up
to
you
in
kindness
for
all
my
unjust
i
am
more
than
delighted
to
learn
that
cloud
is
no
longer
to
overshadow
us
miss
minor
has
made
a
full
explanation
then
you
have
been
completely
exonerated
and
restored
to
my
good
as
she
spoke
i
became
aware
that
she
was
busily
engaged
upon
some
task
and
when
she
ended
i
felt
the
steel
of
a
touch
my
hand
please
pass
this
to
maria
she
said
calmly
and
hand
me
back
the
one
she
you
are
loading
then
i
asked
as
i
complied
with
her
request
we
have
all
been
busy
is
it
terrible
i
was
so
frightened
at
first
but
now
they
tell
me
that
you
and
your
men
have
come
there
is
no
longer
danger
of
those
horrible
creatures
getting
in
you
knew
then
that
i
was
in
the
house
i
was
told
some
noble
confederates
had
accompanied
lieutenant
caton
back
to
aid
us
but
your
name
was
not
then
my
appearance
must
have
proven
a
complete
surprise
yes
and
no
she
answered
frankly
i
was
not
sure
it
was
you
of
course
and
i
did
not
venture
to
ask
but
i
knew
you
were
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
such
an
act
would
be
in
every
way
characteristic
i
was
certain
you
would
come
if
you
knew
and
i
i
well
really
i
hoped
it
in
spite
of
a
slight
effort
at
restraint
i
groped
in
the
darkness
until
i
touched
her
hand
for
the
moment
she
permitted
me
to
retain
it
as
if
unconsciously
within
my
grasp
why
i
questioned
scarcely
relying
upon
my
own
voice
oh
one
always
trusts
friends
more
readily
than
strangers
and
i
have
seen
you
in
danger
before
and
possess
such
confidence
in
your
courage
and
but
miss
minor
took
particular
care
to
inform
me
you
felt
little
or
no
interest
in
me
that
you
never
even
spoke
of
me
except
as
she
compelled
you
to
do
for
a
moment
she
did
not
answer
and
then
with
a
light
laugh
said
did
she
really
how
very
kind
of
her
and
how
extremely
intimate
you
must
have
become
to
draw
forth
so
frank
a
confession
however
captain
wayne
you
must
not
give
credence
to
all
you
hear
about
me
even
from
celia
you
know
one
does
not
usually
give
public
expression
to
one
more
secret
thoughts
and
i
can
assure
you
i
have
always
been
most
deeply
interested
whenever
you
were
the
subject
of
our
her
words
made
me
feel
i
might
be
an
intruder
on
your
you
are
never
that
cold
as
i
appeared
only
a
few
hours
ago
i
was
yet
thinking
of
you
as
i
entered
the
arbor
perhaps
that
was
why
the
sight
meeting
my
eyes
proved
such
a
possibly
she
felt
our
conversation
growing
dangerously
intimate
for
in
the
silence
which
ensued
she
gently
withdrew
her
hand
as
she
did
so
my
fingers
chanced
to
touch
the
plain
gold
ring
she
wore
it
was
like
a
dash
of
water
in
my
face
and
instantly
brought
back
to
me
our
common
danger
how
constant
the
firing
continues
she
said
at
last
as
i
sat
struggling
dumbly
with
temptation
a
mere
waste
of
powder
i
fear
was
my
reply
given
thoughtlessly
when
the
rush
finally
comes
we
are
likely
to
be
without
sufficient
ammunition
to
repel
when
the
rush
comes
she
echoed
in
startled
tone
do
you
expect
an
assault
i
hardly
expect
those
fellows
out
there
will
ever
leave
without
a
most
determined
effort
to
carry
the
house
by
storm
they
are
here
for
plunder
and
will
not
be
baffled
easily
nor
will
the
leaders
hesitate
to
sacrifice
any
number
of
lives
to
gain
their
end
especially
now
that
a
desire
for
revenge
has
been
added
to
the
original
lust
for
spoils
i
have
been
among
them
you
know
and
learned
enough
of
their
power
organization
and
leadership
to
convince
me
they
will
never
raise
the
siege
until
they
exhaust
every
resource
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
simply
drawing
all
this
fire
in
the
hope
that
our
ammunition
will
thus
be
uselessly
expended
it
is
an
old
army
trick
and
one
i
am
surprised
to
see
so
experienced
an
officer
as
major
brennan
yield
to
in
my
judgment
they
will
make
an
effort
to
rush
us
as
soon
as
there
is
sufficient
but
why
not
warn
him
i
smiled
to
myself
at
the
naive
question
surely
it
could
not
be
possible
she
remained
ignorant
of
the
feud
existing
between
us
she
had
twice
witnessed
our
hostile
meetings
and
certainly
could
not
forget
how
we
had
last
parted
major
brennan
would
scarcely
welcome
any
interference
on
my
but
surely
as
a
soldier
he
must
value
the
advice
of
another
soldier
possibly
you
forget
i
explained
striving
to
speak
as
lightly
of
it
as
might
be
that
there
is
a
lack
of
friendship
between
major
brennan
and
still
she
asked
truly
i
thought
that
might
all
be
over
even
if
it
survived
until
now
this
noble
act
of
yours
in
coming
to
our
defence
should
have
earned
you
his
gratitude
he
he
has
never
once
mentioned
your
name
to
me
since
that
not
even
when
i
came
here
with
my
troop
i
believe
no
yet
i
did
not
connect
that
fact
with
the
other
i
supposed
it
a
mere
oversight
or
that
he
believed
the
mention
of
your
name
would
not
greatly
interest
me
surely
captain
wayne
you
are
not
keeping
open
this
unhappy
wound
on
my
word
no
but
i
regret
to
confess
it
is
very
far
from
being
he
major
brennan
does
not
know
then
that
you
are
here
now
with
me
she
evidently
hesitated
to
ask
this
question
certainly
not
in
surprise
at
her
apparent
innocence
you
can
not
have
supposed
i
had
been
sent
here
by
him
to
talk
with
you
i
i
did
not
know
i
do
not
think
i
realized
she
stammered
vainly
seeking
for
words
with
which
to
make
clear
her
bewilderment
i
imagined
you
might
have
come
at
his
suggestion
to
see
that
we
were
amply
protected
this
is
all
so
very
strange
he
does
not
even
know
you
are
here
with
us
no
i
admitted
reluctantly
perhaps
i
have
no
excuse
even
for
being
here
at
all
my
duty
as
a
soldier
is
certainly
elsewhere
but
i
could
not
rest
content
until
i
knew
you
were
in
a
position
of
safety
believe
me
brennan
i
have
intended
no
indiscretion
but
i
was
informed
by
a
soldier
that
you
were
being
held
here
under
fire
it
would
have
been
useless
for
me
to
appeal
to
the
major
for
information
and
i
felt
i
must
know
the
truth
if
i
have
erred
in
this
i
can
only
plead
the
deep
interest
i
have
always
had
in
your
her
hand
touched
mine
impulsively
and
it
was
warm
and
throbbing
i
can
merely
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
captain
wayne
and
assure
you
i
both
understand
and
appreciate
your
purpose
but
truly
i
do
not
wish
any
trouble
to
occur
again
you
will
go
back
to
your
post
will
you
not
you
can
serve
me
best
in
that
way
and
retain
the
gratitude
and
admiration
i
have
ever
felt
for
there
was
a
pathetic
pleading
in
her
voice
low
as
she
spoke
impossible
to
resist
it
made
me
feel
thoroughly
ashamed
of
my
impulsive
action
at
once
brennan
i
returned
earnestly
i
realize
i
have
done
wrong
in
ever
coming
here
as
i
have
it
is
my
first
act
of
disobedience
to
orders
in
all
my
military
life
but
tell
me
first
that
i
have
forfeited
neither
your
confidence
nor
your
friendship
her
warm
hand
closed
frankly
over
mine
and
as
i
bent
above
it
her
hair
softly
brushed
my
cheek
you
have
not
she
answered
so
soft
and
low
i
could
barely
catch
the
words
i
appreciate
your
motive
and
shall
always
respect
and
honor
she
paused
a
moment
then
added
quickly
as
though
in
sudden
rush
of
feeling
no
friend
stands
higher
in
my
esteem
than
you
now
please
go
captain
as
i
crept
back
through
the
darkness
passing
beneath
the
piano
into
the
front
room
which
was
filled
with
the
choking
fumes
of
powder
my
mind
was
a
chaos
of
emotions
impossible
to
analyze
the
touch
of
her
soft
hand
was
yet
warm
upon
me
and
her
manner
as
well
as
her
words
caused
my
blood
to
leap
riotously
in
my
veins
what
did
this
woman
mean
was
it
possible
she
loved
me
and
was
fighting
even
as
i
to
conquer
a
passion
that
could
never
be
realized
which
had
no
right
to
exist
surely
young
and
fair
as
she
was
she
could
be
no
vain
and
shallow
coquette
venturing
upon
flirtation
for
the
mere
excitement
of
it
the
calm
of
her
nature
her
marked
pride
and
strength
of
character
stamped
this
as
impossible
honesty
and
pure
true
womanhood
were
woven
into
her
every
word
and
act
that
indefinable
something
which
all
men
feel
and
respect
was
about
her
like
an
atmosphere
to
doubt
her
for
an
instant
was
beyond
my
power
yet
she
had
made
me
feel
i
was
more
to
her
than
a
mere
friend
i
longed
to
go
back
to
pour
forth
those
words
i
had
struggled
so
hard
not
to
speak
to
urge
the
high
law
of
mutual
love
as
final
arbiter
of
our
destiny
but
no
i
simply
could
not
honor
chained
me
and
the
depth
of
my
respect
would
never
permit
of
her
humiliation
if
she
had
become
weak
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
remain
strong
the
very
depth
of
love
which
drew
me
to
her
operated
now
in
restraint
god
alone
knows
the
struggle
in
the
darkness
as
i
continued
to
move
slowly
away
from
her
and
toward
the
door
so
deep
indeed
was
my
agitation
so
intense
my
thought
that
i
scarcely
realized
i
was
creeping
along
barely
beneath
the
dead
line
of
those
bullets
which
constantly
swept
the
apartment
their
crashing
into
the
wall
was
almost
meaningless
and
i
barely
noted
either
the
dense
smoke
or
the
fitful
flashes
of
flame
as
the
little
garrison
returned
shot
for
shot
it
was
brennan
voice
how
hateful
it
sounded
then
which
recalled
my
attention
mapes
he
said
with
the
sharp
tone
of
wearied
command
take
a
crack
at
that
fellow
over
yonder
by
the
big
tree
he
must
be
in
range
you
men
i
verily
believe
shut
your
eyes
when
you
shoot
for
there
has
a
man
dropped
out
there
in
the
last
half
i
had
reached
the
door
by
this
time
but
paused
now
determined
to
venture
one
word
of
expostulation
at
his
recklessness
major
brennan
i
said
speaking
sufficiently
loud
to
be
audible
above
the
uproar
do
you
not
think
they
will
attempt
to
charge
the
house
not
while
we
keep
up
this
fire
he
returned
coldly
evidently
recognizing
my
voice
i
grant
that
at
least
while
darkness
lasts
but
you
have
just
complained
that
your
men
were
doing
but
small
execution
and
is
there
not
danger
of
exhausting
our
stock
of
ammunition
by
such
a
useless
fusillade
it
will
last
until
our
fellows
get
here
that
is
if
your
man
was
ever
really
sent
for
aid
as
you
there
was
a
thinly
veiled
sneer
in
the
words
as
he
spoke
them
but
i
curbed
my
temper
well
in
my
judgment
sir
and
i
tell
it
you
because
i
deem
it
a
duty
i
retorted
plainly
you
are
making
a
grave
mistake
which
you
may
realize
when
it
becomes
too
late
to
rectify
it
possibly
i
have
no
right
to
criticise
one
who
is
technically
in
command
yet
i
am
serving
as
a
volunteer
and
the
conditions
are
peculiar
i
not
only
remember
the
scene
witnessed
by
me
in
the
lines
out
yonder
but
also
recall
the
fact
that
we
are
here
to
fulfil
a
sacred
duty
the
defence
of
helpless
women
from
outrage
a
fatal
mistake
upon
our
part
would
be
your
deep
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
ladies
is
purely
chivalric
i
presume
it
is
merely
the
interest
a
true
soldier
must
always
feel
i
responded
determined
not
to
be
goaded
into
quarrel
i
have
neither
wife
nor
sister
but
i
have
a
very
well
sir
and
his
tone
was
rough
and
overbearing
then
kindly
recall
your
soldierly
instincts
to
another
little
matter
i
chance
to
command
here
by
authority
of
rank
and
hold
myself
responsible
for
the
proper
defence
of
this
portion
of
the
house
i
believe
you
have
already
been
assigned
your
duties
if
you
will
attend
to
them
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
and
whenever
i
may
desire
your
valuable
advice
i
shall
take
pleasure
in
sending
for
i
have
often
wondered
since
how
i
controlled
myself
yet
i
did
biting
my
lip
till
the
blood
came
a
fair
reproachful
face
ever
before
my
eyes
i
shall
obey
your
orders
i
managed
to
say
with
calmness
so
soon
as
i
could
control
my
voice
to
speak
at
all
but
shall
hold
myself
and
my
men
prepared
for
a
call
here
at
any
as
you
please
with
an
sneer
i
have
always
found
you
exceedingly
anxious
to
be
with
the
ladies
indeed
i
have
wondered
if
you
might
not
prove
a
modern
illustration
of
that
ancient
worthy
best
boast
was
but
to
wear
a
braid
of
his
fair
lady
hair
i
turned
away
in
silence
and
strode
back
to
my
post
white
with
anger
the
remained
as
i
had
left
it
and
when
i
lay
down
in
my
old
position
and
peered
out
throught
the
broken
blind
i
could
mark
no
change
in
the
appearance
of
our
besiegers
chapter
xxxii
hand
to
hand
i
have
never
been
willing
to
believe
i
slept
during
the
next
hour
wearied
as
i
have
often
been
duty
has
ever
held
my
eyes
wide
open
and
i
prefer
to
think
i
merely
plunged
so
deep
in
reflection
as
to
become
oblivious
of
all
occurring
about
me
surely
i
had
sufficient
excuse
however
this
may
be
when
i
once
again
aroused
to
observe
my
surroundings
the
faint
gray
light
of
early
dawn
rested
upon
the
outside
world
and
through
the
fleeting
shadows
of
the
mist
i
was
able
to
distinguish
much
which
before
had
been
shrouded
by
the
black
curtain
in
front
of
the
window
where
i
rested
the
lawn
sloped
gradually
downward
until
it
terminated
at
a
low
picket
fence
thickly
covered
with
vines
a
great
variety
of
shrubs
which
during
the
night
had
doubtless
afforded
shelter
for
sharpshooters
dotted
this
grass
plot
while
beyond
the
fence
boundary
stood
a
double
row
of
large
trees
to
the
far
left
of
our
position
the
burnt
stable
yet
smouldered
dully
occasionally
sending
up
a
shower
of
sparks
as
a
draught
of
air
fanned
the
embers
but
there
were
few
signs
of
life
visible
for
the
moment
i
even
hoped
our
enemies
might
have
grown
discouraged
and
withdrawn
what
has
become
of
the
guerillas
i
asked
in
wonderment
turning
as
i
spoke
to
face
the
federal
corporal
who
lay
on
the
other
side
of
me
is
it
possible
they
have
given
up
i
think
not
captain
he
replied
respectfully
saluting
as
he
would
one
of
his
own
officers
they
were
there
just
before
the
light
came
and
i
saw
a
dozen
or
more
stealing
along
behind
the
fence
not
five
minutes
ago
see
there
is
a
squad
of
them
now
huddled
together
back
of
where
the
stable
i
noticed
them
as
he
spoke
and
their
movements
instantly
aroused
my
suspicion
screw
your
eye
close
to
the
corner
of
the
pane
i
ordered
hurriedly
and
see
what
you
make
out
toward
the
front
of
the
he
did
as
directed
and
for
a
moment
continued
to
gaze
silently
into
the
gray
dawn
well
i
asked
impatiently
there
men
out
there
sure
plenty
of
he
reported
slowly
it
looks
to
me
mighty
like
the
end
of
a
line
of
battle
right
there
by
that
big
anyhow
there
must
be
all
of
twenty
fellows
lying
close
together
between
there
and
where
the
corner
of
the
house
shuts
off
my
view
i
do
see
none
this
side
anywhere
unless
it
a
shooter
or
two
hiding
along
the
fence
where
the
vines
are
that
it
my
lad
i
exclaimed
heartily
getting
upon
my
feet
as
i
spoke
we
can
stand
up
now
there
no
danger
here
but
there
will
be
music
for
all
of
us
presently
those
fellows
are
getting
ready
to
charge
us
front
and
there
were
five
in
the
room
i
could
see
them
only
indistinctly
as
the
morning
light
was
not
yet
sufficiently
strong
to
penetrate
clearly
to
where
we
were
but
i
was
able
to
note
those
present
the
corporal
and
his
wounded
companion
with
hollis
and
call
of
my
troop
let
the
wounded
man
remain
and
guard
these
windows
i
commanded
he
would
prove
of
small
value
in
a
hand
to
hand
struggle
but
can
probably
do
some
shooting
the
rest
come
with
i
led
them
forth
into
the
wide
hallway
which
extended
the
full
length
of
the
house
with
a
broad
flight
of
stairs
just
forward
of
the
centre
gradually
curving
and
leading
to
the
second
story
i
was
fully
determined
as
to
my
duty
whether
orders
reached
me
or
not
the
moment
an
assault
was
launched
i
should
throw
all
the
force
i
commanded
beside
brennan
and
between
our
assailants
and
the
imperilled
women
the
suspended
light
was
yet
burning
as
we
came
out
but
flickered
wildly
as
if
in
a
strong
draught
of
air
and
i
noticed
that
the
constant
rain
of
bullets
during
the
night
had
badly
splintered
an
upper
panel
of
the
door
halfway
down
the
broad
hallway
and
partially
obscured
by
the
turn
of
the
stairs
a
door
stood
slightly
ajar
upon
the
right
hand
conjecturing
this
might
be
where
the
defenders
of
the
eastern
exposure
were
lying
i
peered
within
the
blinds
were
tightly
drawn
and
i
was
able
to
perceive
little
of
its
interior
excepting
that
the
walls
were
lined
with
books
ebers
i
called
thinking
he
must
be
there
are
you
in
charge
here
i
vos
captain
came
the
instant
reply
and
he
at
once
emerged
from
the
darkness
his
honest
face
full
of
interest
is
it
der
preakfast
vot
is
already
hardly

i

may
enjoy

no

but
i

did
you

out
here
in

hall
and
have

party
i
said
ignoring
his
pathetic
appeal
how
many
have
you

und
captain
dey
vos
most
as
veak
as
i
am
mit
netting
to
seeing
i
was
not
to
be
moved
by
thought
of
their
pitiable
condition
he
drew
back
with
a
profound
sigh
and
as
he
disappeared
some
one
came
hastily
toward
us
along
the
hallway
from
the
rear
what
is
it
caton
i
asked
anxiously
as
i
recognized
him
they
are
forming
to
rush
me
i
think
he
answered
i
need
a
few
more
men
if
i
can
get
they
are
preparing
to
assault
front
and
rear
at
the
same
time
i
answered
they
are
massing
now
and
in
my
judgment
brennan
will
have
to
face
the
brunt
of
it
the
front
of
this
house
is
greatly
exposed
and
will
prove
extremely
difficult
to
defend
if
they
come
against
it
with
any
force
how
many
men
do
you
absolutely
require
in
order
to
hold
your
position
remember
the
women
are
all
in
the
front
part
of
the
house
and
we
must
protect
them
at
all
good
god
wayne
do
you
think
i
am
likely
to
forget
with
celia
minor
among
them
he
exclaimed
indignantly
nothing
but
a
strict
sense
of
duty
holds
me
one
moment
where
i
am
heaven
knows
i
wish
to
be
with
her
and
by
thunder
brennan
is
aware
of
then
come
with
me
i
cried
there
are
times
when
a
higher
law
than
that
of
military
despotism
should
control
our
actions
i
am
going
there
orders
or
no
orders
ebers
can
command
your
detachment
and
accomplish
all
the
service
you
possibly
could
your
rightful
place
is
between
these
ruffians
and
the
woman
you
love
how
many
additional
men
will
be
required
to
make
the
back
of
the
house
secure
his
face
brightened
as
i
was
speaking
and
the
haggard
look
vanished
from
his
eyes
i
feel
like
a
new
man
wayne
he
said
thankfully
and
i
know
you
are
right
four
more
would
be
sufficient
besides
the
one
in
command
the
wainscoting
is
high
and
of
solid
oak
the
windows
are
small
there
is
no
porch
while
the
guns
have
a
perfectly
clear
range
for
nearly
a
hundred
good
ebers
i
said
as
my
portly
sergeant
again
emerged
from
out
the
darkness
take
your
four
men
back
to
the
kitchen
and
assume
command
the
guerillas
are
preparing
to
make
a
rush
there
and
you
must
drive
them
back
by
rapid
fire
hurry
along
by
chiminy
but
i
vos
glad
to
git
in
der
kitchen
anyhow
is
der
anyting
cold
to
put
in
der
stomach
in
dot
bantry
he
asked
anxiously
you
will
have
something
exceedingly
hot
in
your
stomach
unless
you
move
more
lively
i
said
sternly
the
little
group
had
barely
vanished
beyond
the
glow
of
the
light
when
from
without
our
ears
were
suddenly
assailed
by
a
wild
exulting
yell
that
bespoke
the
charge
there
they
are
i
cried
now
lads
come
with
me
the
dull
gray
chilling
dawn
revealed
a
room
in
utmost
disorder
the
windows
shattered
the
blinds
cut
and
splintered
the
walls
scarred
with
bullets
and
disfigured
with
stains
of
blood
the
furniture
overturned
and
broken
a
dead
soldier
in
gray
uniform
lay
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
his
a
dark
stain
upon
the
rich
carpet
a
man
with
coat
off
and
blue
shirt
ripped
wide
open
was
leaning
against
the
further
wall
vainly
endeavoring
to
stanch
a
wound
in
his
chest
brennan
was
upon
one
knee
near
the
central
window
a
smoking
gun
in
his
hand
a
red
welt
showing
ghastly
across
his
cheek
all
this
i
saw
in
a
single
glance
and
then
with
the
leap
of
a
panther
i
was
beside
him
gazing
out
into
the
morning
mist
and
firing
as
fast
as
i
could
handle
my
gun
through
the
shifting
smoke
clouds
we
could
see
them
advancing
on
a
run
an
ugly
motley
line
part
blue
part
gray
part
everything
yelling
as
they
swept
forward
like
a
pack
of
infuriated
wolves
their
fierce
faces
scowling
savagely
behind
the
rifles
it
was
half
war
half
riot
the
reckless
onslaught
of
outcasts
bent
on
plunder
inspired
by
lust
yet
guided
by
rude
discipline
i
knew
little
of
detail
faces
were
blurred
unrecognizable
all
i
seemed
to
note
clearly
was
that
solid
brutal
heartless
blaspheming
line
of
desperate
men
sweeping
toward
us
with
a
relentless
fury
our
puny
bullets
could
not
check
reckless
ferocity
was
in
that
mad
rush
they
pressed
on
more
like
demons
than
human
beings
i
saw
men
fall
i
saw
the
living
stumble
over
the
dead
i
heard
cries
of
agony
shouts
curses
but
there
was
no
pause
i
could
mark
their
faces
now
cruel
angry
revengeful
the
hands
that
grasped
the
veranda
railings
the
leaping
bodies
the
uplifted
to
batter
down
our
frail
defences
as
trapped
tigers
we
fought
hurling
them
back
from
the
windows
slashing
clubbing
striking
with
fist
and
steel
two
lay
dead
across
the
sill
before
me
cloven
to
the
very
chin
but
their
bleeding
bodies
were
hurled
remorselessly
aside
while
others
clambered
forward
mad
from
lust
of
blood
crazed
with
liquor
with
clubbed
guns
we
cleared
it
again
and
again
battering
mercilessly
at
every
head
that
fronted
us
then
a
great
giant
of
a
fellow
dead
or
alive
i
know
not
was
hurled
headlong
through
the
opening
an
inert
limp
weight
that
bore
the
two
soldiers
beside
me
to
the
floor
beneath
his
body
with
wide
sweep
of
my
gun
i
struck
him
shattering
the
stock
into
fragments
and
swung
back
to
meet
the
others
the
hot
barrel
falling
to
right
and
left
like
a
flail
they
were
through
and
on
me
wild
as
any
of
the
north
i
fought
crazed
with
blood
unconscious
of
injury
animated
solely
by
desire
to
strike
and
slay
back
i
had
to
go
back
i
trod
on
dead
bodies
on
wounded
shrieking
in
pain
yet
no
man
who
came
within
sweep
of
that
iron
bar
lived
i
loved
to
hear
the
thud
of
it
and
i
fronted
those
glaring
eyes
my
blood
afire
my
arms
like
steel
through
the
red
mist
i
beheld
caton
for
an
instant
as
twenty
brutal
hands
uplifted
and
then
hurled
him
into
the
ruck
beneath
their
feet
whether
i
fought
alone
i
knew
not
cared
not
then
some
one
pressed
next
to
me
facing
as
i
did
wielding
a
sword
like
a
madman
we
had
our
backs
against
the
piano
our
shoulders
touched
before
us
that
mob
swayed
checked
for
the
moment
held
fast
by
sudden
overpowering
dread
i
glanced
aside
my
companion
was
brennan
hatless
his
eyes
aflame
his
coat
torn
off
his
shirt
ripped
open
to
the
waist
his
bare
breast
red
with
blood
no
shootin
damn
ye
shouted
a
voice
hoarsely
no
shootin
i
want
that
reb
alive
through
the
swirling
smoke
i
recognized
the
malicious
face
of
red
lowrie
as
he
pushed
his
way
to
the
front
to
me
it
was
like
a
personal
challenge
to
combat
rush
them
i
muttered
into
brennan
ear
hurl
them
back
a
bit
and
then
dodge
under
into
the
next
i
never
waited
to
ascertain
if
he
heard
me
with
one
fierce
spring
i
struck
their
stunned
line
and
my
iron
bar
swept
a
clear
space
as
it
crashed
remorselessly
into
them
the
next
instant
lowrie
and
i
were
seemingly
alone
and
fronting
each
other
a
wild
cat
enraged
by
pain
looks
as
he
did
when
he
leaped
to
meet
me
hate
deadly
relentless
glared
in
his
eyes
and
with
a
yell
of
exultation
he
swung
up
his
long
rifle
and
struck
savagely
at
my
head
with
the
stock
i
caught
it
partially
on
my
barrel
breaking
its
full
force
and
even
as
it
descended
upon
my
shoulder
jabbed
the
muzzle
hard
into
his
leering
face
with
a
snarl
of
pain
he
dropped
his
gun
and
grappled
with
me
but
as
his
fingers
closed
about
my
throat
something
swirled
down
through
the
maze
and
the
maddened
brute
staggered
back
his
arms
uplifted
his
red
beard
cloven
in
twain
now
for
it
wayne
shouted
brennan
back
with
you
with
a
dive
i
went
under
the
piano
i
heard
the
sliding
doors
shut
behind
us
and
almost
with
the
sound
was
again
upon
my
feet
to
the
stairs
i
panted
brennan
take
the
women
to
the
stairs
those
fellows
are
not
in
the
hallway
yet
and
we
can
hold
them
there
a
in
our
terrible
need
for
haste
and
amid
the
thick
swirling
smoke
filling
that
inner
room
almost
to
suffocation
i
grasped
the
woman
chancing
to
be
nearest
me
without
knowing
at
the
moment
who
she
was
already
the
were
splintering
the
light
wood
behind
us
into
staves
and
i
hastily
dragged
my
dazed
companion
forward
the
others
were
in
advance
and
we
groped
our
way
like
blind
persons
out
into
the
hall
by
rare
good
fortune
it
was
yet
unoccupied
and
as
we
took
the
few
hurried
steps
toward
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
found
my
arm
was
encircling
celia
minor
the
depth
of
despair
within
her
dark
eyes
and
the
speechless
anguish
of
her
white
face
swept
for
an
instant
the
fierce
rage
of
battle
from
my
brain
do
not
fail
us
now
miss
minor
i
urged
kindly
we
may
yet
hold
out
until
help
oh
it
is
not
that
she
cried
pitifully
but
arthur
where
is
arthur
god
knows
i
was
compelled
to
answer
i
saw
him
fronting
the
first
rush
when
it
struck
us
i
think
he
went
down
yet
he
may
not
be
seriously
she
burst
into
tears
but
i
had
no
time
to
comfort
her
for
at
that
moment
the
mob
discovering
our
direction
of
escape
jammed
both
doorways
and
surged
forth
howling
into
the
hall
up
i
cried
forcing
her
forward
up
with
you
quick
i
paused
a
scant
second
to
pluck
a
sabre
from
beside
a
dead
soldier
on
the
floor
and
then
with
a
spring
up
the
intervening
steps
faced
about
at
brennan
side
on
the
first
landing
we
ought
to
leave
our
mark
on
those
incarnate
devils
here
he
said
grimly
wiping
his
red
blade
on
the
carpet
unless
they
reach
the
second
story
from
without
and
take
us
in
the
rear
i
answered
we
ought
to
hold
back
the
whole
cowardly
crew
so
long
as
they
refuse
to
it
was
a
scene
to
abide
long
with
a
man
a
horrible
nightmare
never
to
be
forgotten
above
us
protected
somewhat
by
the
abrupt
curve
of
the
wide
staircase
crouched
the
women
two
were
sobbing
their
heads
buried
in
their
hands
but
maria
and
brennan
sat
white
of
face
and
i
caught
one
quick
glance
at
the
fair
face
i
loved
my
sweet
lady
of
the
north
thinking
indeed
it
might
prove
the
last
on
earth
and
knew
her
eyes
were
upon
me
then
stronger
of
heart
than
ever
for
the
coming
struggle
i
fronted
that
scene
below
through
the
rising
haze
of
smoke
i
looked
down
into
angry
faces
unkempt
beards
and
brandished
weapons
the
baffled
rascals
poured
out
upon
us
from
both
doors
crowding
into
the
narrow
space
cursing
threatening
thirsting
for
revenge
yet
they
were
seemingly
leaderless
and
the
boldest
among
them
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
had
already
felt
our
arms
had
tested
our
steel
and
knew
well
that
grim
death
awaited
their
advance
but
they
could
not
pause
there
long
the
ever
increasing
rush
of
those
behind
pressed
the
earlier
arrivals
steadily
forward
grim
necessity
furnished
a
courage
naturally
lacking
and
suddenly
giving
vent
to
a
fierce
shout
they
were
hurled
upward
seeking
to
crush
us
at
whatever
sacrifice
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
we
met
them
with
the
point
in
the
good
old
roman
way
thrusting
home
remorselessly
fighting
with
silent
contempt
for
them
which
must
have
been
maddening
i
even
heard
brennan
laugh
as
he
pierced
a
huge
ruffian
through
the
shoulder
and
hurled
him
backward
but
at
that
moment
i
saw
craig
knock
aside
a
levelled
gun
and
press
his
way
to
the
front
of
the
seething
mass
to
assume
control
his
face
was
inflamed
his
eyes
bloodshot
drink
had
changed
him
into
a
very
demon
damn
ye
red
told
you
not
to
fire
he
yelled
come
on
you
dogs
you
could
eat
up
if
ye
was
sich
blamed
cowards
there
only
two
and
we
hang
them
he
leaped
straight
up
the
broad
steps
his
long
cavalry
sabre
in
hand
while
a
dozen
of
the
boldest
followed
him
brennan
swung
his
sword
high
over
head
grasping
it
with
both
hands
for
a
even
as
i
thrust
directly
at
the
fellow
throat
the
uplifted
blade
struck
the
chain
of
the
hanging
lamp
snapped
at
the
hilt
and
losing
his
balance
the
major
plunged
headlong
into
the
ruck
beneath
the
downward
fall
of
his
body
swept
the
stairs
as
i
stood
there
panting
and
breathless
a
woman
rushed
downward
believing
she
would
throw
herself
into
that
tangled
mass
below
i
instantly
caught
her
to
me
do
i
cried
anxiously
you
can
not
help
him
for
god
sake
go
back
where
you
it
is
not
that
she
exclaimed
her
voice
thrilling
with
excitement
oh
captain
wayne
do
you
not
hear
the
bugles
as
by
magic
those
hateful
faces
vanished
disappearing
by
means
of
every
opening
leading
out
from
the
hall
and
when
the
cheering
surged
in
through
the
broken
door
i
was
yet
standing
there
apparently
alone
but
for
the
dead
leaning
weak
and
breathless
against
the
wall
my
arm
about
edith
brennan
chapter
xxxiii
a
belligerent
german
a
young
officer
whose
red
face
was
rendered
extremely
conspicuous
by
the
blue
of
his
uniform
led
the
rush
of
his
soldiers
as
they
came
tumbling
gallantly
into
the
hall
up
there
men
he
cried
catching
instant
sight
of
me
and
pointing
get
that
johnny
with
the
as
they
sprang
eagerly
forward
over
the
dead
bodies
littering
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
brennan
scrambled
unsteadily
to
his
feet
and
halted
them
with
imperious
gesture
leave
him
alone
he
commanded
that
is
the
commander
of
the
confederate
detachment
who
came
to
our
aid
the
guerillas
have
fled
down
the
hallway
and
are
most
of
them
outside
by
now
wayne
he
turned
and
glanced
up
at
us
his
face
instantly
darkening
at
the
tableau
kindly
assist
the
ladies
to
descend
we
must
get
them
out
of
this
he
lifted
them
one
by
one
and
with
ceremonious
politeness
across
the
ghastly
pile
of
dead
and
wounded
men
escort
them
to
the
library
he
suggested
as
i
hesitated
that
room
will
probably
be
found
i
was
somewhat
surprised
that
brennan
should
not
have
come
personally
to
the
aid
of
his
wife
but
as
he
ignored
her
presence
utterly
i
at
once
offered
her
my
arm
and
silently
led
the
way
to
the
room
designated
the
others
following
as
best
they
might
the
apartment
was
unoccupied
exhibiting
no
signs
of
the
late
struggle
and
i
found
comfortable
resting
places
for
all
miss
minor
was
yet
sobbing
softly
her
face
hidden
upon
her
mother
shoulder
and
i
felt
constrained
to
speak
with
her
i
shall
go
at
once
i
said
kindly
to
ascertain
all
i
can
regarding
lieutenant
caton
and
will
bring
you
she
thanked
me
with
a
glance
of
her
dark
eyes
clouded
with
tears
but
as
i
turned
hastily
away
to
execute
this
errand
brennan
laid
restraining
hand
upon
my
arm
captain
wayne
she
said
with
much
seriousness
you
are
very
unselfish
but
you
must
not
go
until
your
own
wounds
have
been
attended
to
they
may
be
far
more
serious
than
you
my
wounds
i
almost
laughed
at
the
gravity
of
her
face
for
although
exhausted
i
was
unconscious
of
any
injury
they
must
be
trivial
indeed
for
i
was
not
even
aware
i
had
but
you
have
she
insisted
her
eyes
full
upon
me
your
hair
is
fairly
clotted
with
blood
while
your
shoulder
is
torn
and
bruised
until
it
is
horrible
to
look
as
i
gazed
at
her
surprised
by
the
anxiety
she
so
openly
displayed
i
chanced
to
behold
myself
reflected
within
a
large
mirror
directly
across
the
room
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
convince
me
her
words
were
fully
justified
my
remains
of
uniform
literally
clung
to
me
in
rags
my
bare
shoulder
looked
a
contused
mass
of
battered
flesh
my
hair
was
matted
and
my
face
blackened
by
powder
stains
and
streaked
with
blood
i
certainly
do
appear
disreputable
enough
i
admitted
but
i
can
assure
you
it
is
nothing
sufficiently
serious
to
require
immediate
attention
indeed
a
little
water
is
probably
all
i
need
besides
why
should
i
care
was
it
not
all
received
for
your
sake
i
spoke
the
pronoun
so
strongly
she
could
not
well
ignore
my
obvious
meaning
nor
did
she
endeavor
to
escape
the
inference
her
face
yet
white
from
the
strain
of
the
past
few
hours
became
rosy
in
an
instant
and
her
eyes
fell
i
know
she
answered
softly
perhaps
that
may
be
why
i
am
so
exceedingly
anxious
your
injuries
should
be
attended
as
i
stepped
without
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
i
was
at
once
startled
by
the
rapid
firing
of
shots
from
the
rear
of
the
house
and
the
next
moment
i
encountered
the
young
officer
hurrying
along
the
hallway
at
the
head
of
a
squad
of
federal
cavalrymen
recognizing
me
in
the
gloom
of
the
passage
he
paused
suddenly
i
owe
you
a
belated
apology
captain
he
exclaimed
cordially
for
having
mistaken
you
for
one
of
those
miscreants
but
really
your
appearance
was
not
having
viewed
myself
since
within
a
mirror
i
replied
i
am
prepared
to
acknowledge
the
mistake
a
most
natural
one
however
i
am
grateful
to
be
out
of
the
scrape
and
can
scarcely
find
fault
with
my
rescuers
five
minutes
more
would
have
witnessed
the
we
rode
hard
he
said
and
were
in
saddle
within
fifteen
minutes
after
the
arrival
of
your
courier
you
evidently
made
a
hard
fight
of
it
the
house
bears
testimony
to
a
terrible
struggle
we
are
rejoicing
to
learn
that
lieutenant
caton
was
merely
stunned
we
believed
him
dead
at
first
and
he
is
far
too
fine
a
fellow
to
go
in
that
he
is
truly
living
then
i
exclaimed
greatly
relieved
miss
minor
to
whom
he
is
engaged
is
sorrowing
over
his
possible
fate
in
the
library
yonder
could
not
two
of
your
men
assist
him
to
her
she
would
do
more
to
hasten
his
recovery
than
any
certainly
was
the
instant
response
haines
you
and
mcdonald
get
the
officer
out
of
the
front
room
carry
him
in
there
where
the
ladies
are
and
then
rejoin
his
face
darkened
as
the
men
designated
departed
on
their
errand
i
really
require
all
the
force
i
possess
he
said
doubtfully
it
seems
impossible
to
dislodge
those
rascals
back
yonder
what
we
need
is
a
field
i
have
been
wondering
at
the
firing
pretty
lively
is
it
have
some
of
those
fellows
made
a
stand
yes
quite
a
crowd
of
them
have
succeeded
in
barricading
themselves
in
the
kitchen
and
it
is
so
arranged
as
to
prove
an
exceedingly
awkward
place
to
attack
we
have
had
three
men
hit
already
in
spite
of
every
precaution
and
i
am
seeking
now
to
discover
some
means
of
forcing
their
position
from
the
hall
their
leader
appears
to
be
a
dutchman
about
as
easy
to
manage
as
a
the
words
aroused
me
to
a
possibility
a
dutchman
you
say
and
in
the
kitchen
have
you
had
sight
of
the
fellow
merely
a
glimpse
and
that
over
a
he
has
a
round
dull
face
with
a
big
flat
that
idiot
is
my
sergeant
lieutenant
and
supposes
he
is
still
fighting
the
lieutenant
looked
at
me
in
surprise
then
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
well
if
that
is
true
he
cried
i
most
sincerely
hope
you
will
call
him
off
before
he
succeeds
in
cleaning
out
our
entire
i
started
down
the
hallway
toward
the
point
of
firing
there
was
a
sharp
jog
in
the
wall
leading
to
the
kitchen
door
and
as
i
approached
it
some
soldiers
stationed
there
warned
me
to
be
careful
they
perfect
devils
to
shoot
sir
said
one
respectfully
an
the
dutchman
fetches
his
man
every
oh
it
will
be
all
right
boys
i
replied
confidently
he
know
before
me
as
i
stepped
forth
was
a
double
door
of
oak
the
upper
half
partially
open
sergeant
i
cried
come
out
the
fight
is
all
for
answer
a
bullet
whizzed
past
me
chugging
into
the
wall
at
my
back
and
i
skipped
around
the
corner
with
a
celerity
of
movement
which
caused
the
fellows
watching
me
to
grin
with
delight
find
me
a
white
cloth
of
some
kind
i
demanded
as
soon
as
i
reached
cover
and
now
thoroughly
angered
we
shall
see
if
that
old
fool
knows
the
meaning
of
a
flag
of
they
succeeded
in
securing
me
a
torn
from
somewhere
and
sheltering
my
body
as
best
i
might
behind
the
wall
angle
i
waved
it
violently
in
full
view
of
the
kitchen
door
for
a
few
moments
it
remained
apparently
unnoted
and
then
ebers
round
placid
countenance
looked
suspiciously
through
the
slight
aperture
did
you
give
op
he
questioned
anxiously
give
up
nothing
i
retorted
my
temper
thoroughly
exhausted
come
out
of
that
you
are
firing
on
your
own
he
put
his
fat
fingers
to
his
nose
and
wiggled
them
derisively
dot
is
too
thin
he
said
meaningly
you
dink
me
von
ol
fool
but
i
show
you

chiminy
i
want
no
friends

he
drew
back
leaving
merely
the
black
muzzle
of
his
gun
projecting
across
the
top
of
the
lower
door
ebers
i
called
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
unless
you
obey
my
orders
i
have
you
strung
up
by
your
own
men

that
door
the
fat
puzzled

peered
once
more
cautiously
over
the
menacing
is
dot
you

take

along
with

only
hurry
up
and
attend
at
once
to
what
i
have
told
i
watched
closely
until
they
had
all
passed
out
and
then
turned
to
the
highly
amused
federal
lieutenant
you
surely
have
a
character
in
that
fellow
he
said
and
i
can
bear
witness
he
is
a
fighter
when
the
time
i
left
them
remembering
then
my
own
need
by
using
the
back
stairway
i
avoided
unpleasant
contact
with
the
traces
of
conflict
yet
visible
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
finally
discovered
a
bathroom
which
afforded
facilities
for
cleansing
my
flesh
wounds
and
making
my
general
appearance
more
presentable
i
found
i
could
do
little
to
improve
the
condition
of
my
clothing
but
after
making
such
changes
for
the
better
as
were
possible
soaking
the
clotted
blood
from
out
my
hair
and
washing
the
powder
stains
from
my
face
i
felt
i
should
no
longer
prove
an
object
of
aversion
even
to
the
critical
eyes
of
the
women
who
would
fully
realize
the
cause
for
my
torn
and
begrimed
uniform
a
glance
from
the
window
told
me
the
federal
cavalrymen
were
bearing
out
the
dead
and
depositing
them
beyond
view
of
the
house
in
the
deserted
negro
cabins
ebers
and
one
or
two
of
my
own
men
were
standing
near
carefully
scanning
the
uncovered
faces
as
they
were
borne
past
while
scraps
of
conversation
overheard
brought
the
information
that
the
long
where
i
had
passed
the
night
on
guard
had
been
converted
into
a
temporary
hospital
irresolute
as
to
my
next
action
i
passed
out
into
the
upper
hall
it
was
deserted
and
strangely
silent
seemingly
far
removed
from
all
those
terrible
scenes
so
lately
enacted
in
the
rooms
beneath
my
head
by
this
time
throbbed
with
pain
i
desired
to
be
alone
to
think
to
map
out
my
future
course
before
proceeding
down
the
stairs
to
meet
the
others
with
this
in
view
i
sank
down
in
complete
weariness
upon
a
convenient
settee
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
muffled
voices
below
while
an
occasional
order
was
spoken
loud
enough
to
reach
me
but
i
was
utterly
alone
and
my
thoughts
wandered
as
though
the
strain
of
the
past
few
hours
had
completely
wrecked
all
my
mental
faculties
it
was
edith
brennan
edith
brennan
who
remained
constantly
before
me
and
wherever
my
eyes
wandered
they
beheld
the
same
which
tantalized
me
by
its
presence
and
mocked
me
in
every
resolve
i
sought
to
form
there
was
no
safety
for
me
and
none
for
her
as
i
now
verily
believed
save
in
my
immediate
departure
we
could
be
together
no
longer
without
my
unlocking
sealed
lips
and
giving
utterance
to
words
she
could
not
listen
to
words
she
must
never
hear
i
was
yet
struggling
to
force
this
decision
into
action
when
complete
fatigue
overcame
me
my
heavy
head
sank
back
upon
the
arm
of
the
settee
and
deep
sleep
closed
my
eyes
chapter
xxxiv
the
words
of
love
it
was
in
my
dreams
i
felt
it
first
a
light
moist
touch
upon
my
burning
forehead
and
i
imagined
i
was
a
child
once
more
back
at
the
old
home
caressed
by
the
soft
hand
of
my
mother
but
as
consciousness
slowly
returned
i
began
to
realize
dimly
where
i
was
and
that
i
was
no
longer
alone
a
gentle
hand
was
stroking
back
the
hair
from
off
my
temples
while
the
barest
uplift
of
my
eyelids
revealed
the
folds
of
a
dark
blue
skirt
pressed
close
to
my
side
instantly
i
realized
who
must
be
the
wearer
and
remained
motionless
until
i
could
better
control
my
first
unwise
impulse
she
spoke
no
word
and
i
cautiously
opened
my
eyes
and
glanced
up
into
her
face
for
a
time
she
remained
unaware
of
my
awakening
and
sat
there
silently
stroking
my
forehead
her
gaze
fixed
musingly
upon
the
window
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
doubtless
she
had
been
sitting
thus
for
some
time
and
had
become
absorbed
in
her
own
reflections
for
i
lay
there
drinking
in
her
beauty
for
several
moments
before
she
chanced
to
glance
downward
and
observe
that
i
was
awake
the
evidences
of
past
exposure
and
strain
were
not
absent
from
her
features
yet
had
not
robbed
her
of
that
delicate
charm
which
to
my
mind
separated
her
so
widely
from
all
others
her
rounded
cheek
yet
retained
the
fresh
hue
of
perfect
health
her
clear
thoughtful
eyes
were
soft
and
earnest
while
the
luxuriant
hair
swept
back
from
off
the
broad
low
forehead
had
been
tastefully
arranged
and
exhibited
no
signs
of
neglect
it
was
not
a
perfect
face
for
there
was
unmistakable
pride
in
it
nor
would
i
venture
to
term
it
faultless
in
contour
or
regularity
of
outline
but
it
was
distinctly
lovable
and
the
dearest
face
for
ever
in
all
this
world
to
me
how
regally
was
the
proud
head
poised
upon
the
round
swelling
throat
and
with
what
regularity
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
to
her
soft
breathing
i
think
the
very
intensity
of
my
gaze
awakened
her
from
reverie
for
she
turned
almost
with
a
start
and
looked
down
upon
me
as
our
eyes
met
a
warm
wave
of
color
dyed
her
throat
and
cheeks
crimson
why
she
exclaimed
in
momentary
confusion
i
supposed
i
should
know
before
you
awoke
and
have
ample
time
to
escape
possibly
if
you
had
been
noting
the
symptoms
of
your
patient
with
greater
care
you
true
i
was
dreaming
she
admitted
and
had
almost
forgotten
where
i
could
i
purchase
your
dream
i
was
intently
studying
your
face
as
you
sat
there
yet
was
unable
to
determine
whether
your
reflections
were
pleasant
or
they
were
merely
foolish
was
the
frank
response
but
such
as
they
were
they
are
certainly
not
for
sale
you
are
better
captain
wayne
how
could
i
fail
to
be
better
with
so
delightful
a
nurse
i
confess
i
am
tempted
to
say
no
so
as
to
regain
the
soft
touch
of
your
palm
upon
my
temple
but
it
was
really
nothing
more
serious
than
fatigue
that
had
overcome
me
i
scarcely
know
how
i
chanced
to
fall
asleep
i
merely
sat
down
here
for
a
rest
it
was
very
quiet
and
that
was
the
last
i
remember
have
i
been
lying
here
long
there
is
a
rule
of
evidence
i
believe
which
protects
a
suspected
person
from
incriminating
himself
but
i
will
acknowledge
that
i
have
been
here
all
of
half
an
hour
she
answered
too
proud
to
deny
her
part
the
people
below
were
wondering
where
you
could
have
gone
and
i
undertook
a
search
upon
my
own
account
yes
sir
somewhat
archly
i
was
afraid
lest
your
injuries
were
more
serious
than
you
believed
them
to
be
i
discovered
you
lying
here
you
were
resting
very
uncomfortably
when
i
first
came
and
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
render
your
position
as
easy
as
possible
i
did
not
forget
that
your
fatigue
came
in
our
could
you
not
say
in
yours
i
corrected
but
i
have
already
been
more
than
repaid
your
hand
upon
my
brow
was
far
more
restful
than
i
can
tell
you
its
soft
stroking
mingled
in
my
dreams
even
before
i
awoke
it
brought
back
to
me
the
thought
of
my
mother
i
do
not
think
i
have
had
a
woman
hand
press
back
my
hair
since
i
was
a
her
eyes
fell
slightly
and
she
moved
uneasily
there
was
a
look
of
pain
upon
your
face
as
you
lay
sleeping
and
i
thought
it
might
ease
you
somewhat
i
have
had
some
experience
as
a
nurse
you
know
she
explained
quietly
you
mentioned
your
mother
is
she
yet
living
she
is
in
richmond
stopping
with
friends
but
since
my
capture
we
have
lost
all
trace
of
each
other
i
was
reported
as
having
been
killed
in
action
and
i
doubt
if
she
even
yet
knows
the
truth
everything
is
so
confused
in
the
capital
that
it
is
impossible
to
trace
any
one
not
directly
connected
with
the
army
once
you
lose
exact
knowledge
of
their
your
father
then
is
dead
he
yielded
his
life
the
first
year
of
the
war
and
our
plantation
near
charlottesville
has
been
constantly
in
the
track
of
the
armies
one
rather
important
battle
indeed
was
fought
upon
it
so
you
may
realize
that
it
is
now
desolate
and
utterly
unfit
for
the
house
yet
stands
the
chimney
and
one
wall
alone
remained
when
i
was
last
there
i
replied
glad
of
the
interest
she
exhibited
fortunately
two
of
the
negro
cabins
were
yet
standing
doubtless
these
will
form
the
nucleus
of
our
home
when
the
war
ceases
they
will
prove
a
trifle
better
than
the
mere
the
south
is
certainly
paying
a
terrible
price
for
rebellion
she
said
soberly
her
fine
eyes
filled
with
tears
only
those
of
us
who
have
beheld
some
portion
of
the
sacrifice
can
ever
realize
how
complete
it
the
uselessness
of
it
is
what
makes
it
seem
now
so
unutterably
yes
she
assented
and
this
the
south
is
beginning
to
understand
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
joy
awaiting
your
mother
when
she
learns
that
you
are
well
after
she
has
mourned
you
as
dead
it
will
almost
repay
her
for
all
the
rest
how
i
should
love
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
as
she
spoke
she
quietly
rose
to
her
feet
and
smiled
pleasantly
as
i
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
sit
up
i
thought
you
must
be
tired
lying
in
that
position
so
long
besides
i
am
sure
i
have
tarried
here
quite
as
long
as
i
should
now
that
i
can
be
of
no
further
as
she
gathered
her
skirts
in
her
hand
preparatory
to
descending
the
stairs
i
yielded
to
temptation
and
stopped
her
right
or
wrong
i
must
yet
have
one
word
more
i
beg
of
you
do
not
desert
me
so
soon
this
may
prove
our
final
meeting
indeed
i
fear
it
must
be
surely
then
it
need
not
be
so
brief
a
one
she
paused
irresolute
one
white
hand
resting
upon
the
dark
her
face
turned
partially
aside
so
i
could
only
guess
at
its
expression
our
final
meeting
she
echoed
my
words
as
though
scarcely
comprehending
their
meaning
yes
i
said
rising
and
standing
before
her
how
can
we
well
hope
it
shall
be
otherwise
i
am
not
free
to
remain
here
even
were
it
best
for
other
reasons
for
i
am
a
soldier
under
orders
you
undoubtedly
will
proceed
north
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
there
is
scarcely
a
probability
that
in
the
great
wide
world
we
shall
meet
the
war
will
soon
be
over
perhaps
then
you
may
come
north
i
scarcely
expect
to
do
so
my
work
then
will
be
to
join
with
my
comrades
in
an
effort
to
rebuild
the
shattered
fortunes
of
virginia
when
the
lines
of
lives
diverge
so
widely
as
ours
must
the
chances
are
indeed
few
that
they
ever
meet
yes
yet
we
are
free
not
always
nor
under
all
circumstances
there
are
outside
influences
which
can
not
be
her
head
was
bowed
slightly
but
she
lifted
it
now
and
i
dreamed
i
saw
unshed
tears
in
her
eyes
but
surely
you
can
remain
here
until
we
leave
she
questioned
evidently
striving
not
to
reveal
the
depth
of
interest
she
felt
in
the
decision
it
will
not
be
until
that
all
details
are
arranged
so
as
to
permit
of
our
departure
i
had
supposed
you
would
certainly
be
with
us
until
mrs
brennan
i
exclaimed
almost
passionately
do
not
tempt
me
your
wish
is
a
temptation
most
difficult
to
why
resist
then
she
did
not
look
at
me
but
stood
twisting
a
handkerchief
nervously
through
her
fingers
the
abrupt
question
startled
me
almost
into
full
confession
but
fortunately
my
eyes
chanced
to
fall
upon
her
and
instantly
i
crushed
the
mad
words
back
into
my
throat
because
it
is
right
i
replied
slowly
feeling
each
sentence
as
a
for
me
to
remain
can
mean
only
one
thing
for
that
i
am
ready
enough
if
i
thought
you
desired
it
but
i
dare
not
choose
such
a
course
you
speak
in
riddles
what
is
the
one
thing
a
personal
meeting
with
major
the
high
color
deserted
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
met
mine
in
sudden
inquiry
oh
no
no
she
exclaimed
with
energy
you
and
frank
must
never
meet
in
that
way
you
mean
a
duel
i
bowed
gravely
i
can
assure
you
i
earnestly
desire
to
avoid
it
for
your
sake
but
am
aware
of
no
possibility
of
escape
except
through
my
immediate
there
has
been
no
challenge
then
not
formally
yet
almost
an
equivalent
i
was
permitted
to
aid
in
defence
of
this
house
only
by
pledging
myself
to
major
brennan
but
why
need
it
be
at
least
now
that
you
have
stood
together
as
comrades
i
fear
i
said
quietly
that
fact
will
not
count
for
much
we
both
fought
inspired
by
your
mine
i
hardly
knew
how
to
interpret
her
tone
certainly
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
major
brennan
dislike
is
based
upon
your
friendship
for
but
there
is
no
reason
she
stammered
he
has
no
cause
his
reason
i
must
leave
him
to
explain
i
interrupted
to
relieve
her
evident
embarrassment
his
words
however
were
extremely
explicit
and
to
ignore
them
by
departure
is
to
imperil
my
own
reputation
in
both
armies
i
would
do
so
for
no
one
else
in
the
world
but
her
reception
of
this
almost
open
avowal
surprised
me
for
an
instant
she
remained
motionless
her
eyes
lowered
upon
the
carpet
a
flush
on
either
cheek
then
they
were
frankly
lifted
to
mine
and
she
extended
both
hands
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
she
asked
gravely
captain
wayne
you
make
me
trust
you
utterly
and
place
me
constantly
in
your
her
words
and
manner
combined
to
make
me
realize
the
depth
of
her
feeling
but
what
did
they
really
betoken
was
it
merely
thankfulness
at
her
husband
escape
from
peril
or
a
personal
devotion
toward
myself
i
could
not
determine
but
might
only
venture
to
believe
the
first
more
probable
then
you
realize
that
i
am
right
yes
slowly
but
making
no
effort
to
release
her
hands
yet
is
no
other
escape
possible
none
within
my
and
you
must
go
i
must
go
unless
you
bid
me
oh
i
can
not
i
can
not
at
such
a
cost
she
cried
and
i
could
feel
her
body
tremble
with
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
but
captain
wayne
our
friendship
surely
need
not
be
severed
now
for
ever
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
it
should
be
i
am
no
cold
heartless
ingrate
and
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
to
serve
me
i
value
every
sacrifice
you
have
made
on
my
behalf
let
us
indeed
part
now
if
as
you
say
it
must
be
so
yet
surely
there
are
happier
days
in
store
for
both
of
us
days
when
the
men
of
this
nation
will
not
wear
different
uniforms
and
deem
it
manly
to
fight
and
kill
each
the
great
struggle
will
certainly
cease
possibly
within
a
very
few
weeks
i
answered
greatly
moved
by
her
earnestness
but
i
fear
the
men
engaged
in
it
will
remain
much
the
same
in
their
natures
however
they
may
dress
i
can
only
say
this
were
the
path
clear
i
would
surely
find
you
no
matter
where
you
were
she
bowed
her
head
against
the
post
of
the
and
sobbed
silently
i
stood
without
speaking
knowing
nothing
i
could
hope
to
say
which
would
in
the
least
comfort
her
for
in
my
own
heart
abode
the
same
dull
despair
at
last
she
looked
up
making
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
disguise
her
emotion
how
terrible
it
is
that
a
woman
must
ever
choose
between
such
evils
she
said
almost
bitterly
the
heart
says
one
thing
and
duty
another
all
through
life
it
seems
to
me
i
have
seen
so
much
of
suffering
in
these
last
few
months
so
much
of
heartless
cruelty
that
i
can
not
bear
to
be
the
cause
of
any
more
you
and
major
brennan
must
not
meet
but
captain
wayne
i
will
not
believe
that
we
are
to
part
thus
for
do
you
mean
that
i
am
to
seek
you
when
the
war
closes
there
will
be
no
time
when
i
shall
not
most
gladly
welcome
your
home
i
asked
wondering
still
if
she
could
mean
all
that
her
words
implied
i
have
never
known
where
you
resided
in
the
stonington
she
smiled
at
me
through
the
tears
yet
clinging
to
her
long
lashes
you
may
never
come
of
course
yet
i
shall
always
feel
now
that
perhaps
you
will
and
that
is
not
like
a
final
is
it
i
bowed
above
the
hands
i
held
and
pressed
my
lips
upon
them
for
the
moment
i
durst
not
speak
and
then
a
voice
suddenly
sounded
in
the
hall
below
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
miss
minor
she
is
probably
lying
down
i
will
run
up
and
call
we
started
as
if
rudely
awakened
from
a
dream
while
a
sudden
expression
of
fright
swept
across
her
face
oh
do
not
meet
him
she
begged
piteously
for
my
sake
do
not
remain
i
will
go
down
the
back
stairway
i
returned
hastily
but
do
you
indeed
mean
it
may
i
come
to
you
yes
yes
but
pray
go
now
unable
longer
to
restrain
myself
i
clasped
her
to
me
held
her
for
one
brief
instant
strained
to
my
breast
kissed
her
twice
upon
lips
which
had
no
opportunity
for
refusal
this
world
is
not
so
wide
but
that
somewhere
in
it
i
shall
again
find
the
one
woman
of
my
heart
i
whispered
passionately
and
was
gone
chapter
xxxv
a
plan
miscarried
i
remembered
as
i
hurried
down
the
back
stairway
her
flushed
face
but
could
recall
no
look
of
indignant
pride
in
those
clear
eyes
whose
pleasant
memory
haunted
me
she
loved
me
of
this
i
now
felt
doubly
assured
and
the
knowledge
made
my
heart
light
even
while
i
dreaded
the
consequences
to
us
both
to
have
won
was
much
even
although
hope
of
possession
did
not
accompany
the
winning
neither
of
us
might
ever
again
blot
out
those
passionate
words
of
love
nor
forget
the
glad
meeting
of
our
lips
i
stepped
out
into
the
kitchen
and
came
to
a
sudden
pause
facing
a
table
laden
with
such
a
variety
and
abundance
of
food
as
had
been
strange
to
me
for
many
a
long
day
directly
opposite
a
napkin
tucked
beneath
his
double
chin
his
plate
piled
high
with
good
things
sat
ebers
while
at
either
end
i
beheld
and
bungay
similarly
situated
the
astonishment
of
our
meeting
seemed
mutual
the
sergeant
apparently
feeling
the
necessity
of
explanation
wiped
his
mouth
soberly
i
vos
yoost
goin
to
fill
me
op
mit
der
dings
like
a
good
soldier
captain
he
said
in
anxiety
so
i
perceive
i
answered
my
own
spirits
high
the
long
night
of
fasting
must
have
left
quite
a
i
vos
like
a
cistern
in
mein
insides
by
no
doubt
well
i
am
rather
hungry
myself
bungay
in
memory
of
old
times
can
not
you
spare
me
a
plate
if
so
i
will
take
pleasure
in
joining
your
happy
company
thank
you
i
see
you
have
found
your
she
glared
down
the
table
and
the
little
fellow
visibly
shrank
i
have
thet
sir
she
answered
grimly
an
i
reckon
as
how
likely
ter
stay
et
hum
arter
but
you
forget
he
is
my
guide
i
protested
not
disinclined
to
test
her
temper
surely
bungay
you
would
not
deprive
the
south
of
his
valuable
service
an
would
i
now
an
did
thet
little
whiffit
promise
me
long
afore
he
ever
did
you
uns
ai
he
my
pertecter
whut
a
lone
female
a
goin
ter
dew
yere
in
ther
mountings
no
man
her
eyes
flashed
angrily
at
me
suah
an
if
it
jist
fightin
as
he
wants
so
bad
i
reckon
as
how
he
kin
git
it
et
hum
goin
ter
no
war
anyhow
ye
kin
bet
i
do
give
him
up
now
i
got
my
hand
on
him
agin
fer
ther
whole
kit
an
caboodle
of
ye
he
bea
much
ter
look
et
likely
but
he
my
man
an
i
reckon
as
how
ther
lord
giv
him
ter
me
ter
take
keer
really
bungay
i
insisted
of
course
it
will
prove
exceedingly
disagreeable
to
me
and
i
shall
greatly
regret
being
compelled
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
but
it
is
undoubtedly
my
duty
to
place
jed
under
guard
and
carry
him
back
to
camp
with
but
suah
an
ye
wo
captain
dear
she
pleaded
entirely
changing
her
tone
whut
good
is
thet
little
whiffit
ter
you
uns
there
never
so
much
as
a
decent
fight
in
him
thet
i
found
in
twenty
years
maybe
ye
think
as
how
i
jist
a
bit
hard
on
him
but
he
thet
gay
at
times
thet
he
drives
me
fair
crazy
every
lick
i
ever
give
him
wus
fer
his
own
good
suah
now
an
ye
never
would
run
off
with
my
man
come
jed
what
do
you
say
are
you
tired
fighting
the
battles
of
the
confederacy
and
prefer
those
of
home
remnants
of
the
bleeding
heart
ellen
and
i
will
seek
apart
the
refuge
of
some
forest
cell
there
like
the
hunted
quarry
dwell
till
on
the
mountain
and
the
moor
the
stern
pursuit
be
passed
and
he
quoted
humbly
i
like
ter
read
all
fightin
well
but
durn
it
cap
it
kinder
hurts
whin
they
hits
ye
on
ther
head
with
a
his
face
lit
up
suddenly
i
sorter
wanter

but
you

nary
a

too

he
out

now
hitched
ter
a

ter

his
biler
never

on
his

fer
all
he
wint
well
i
suppose
i
shall
be
compelled
to
let
you
and
beelzebub
go
but
it
will
prove
a
serious
loss
to
the
cause
of
the
south
i
said
my
thoughts
instantly
turned
by
mention
of
the
mule
to
matters
of
more
importance
i
expect
there
will
be
lively
times
up
your
ye

enthusiastically
it

took
down
a
ebers
was
eating
all
this
time
with
an
eagerness
which
plainly
exhibited
his
fear
lest
i
should
call
him
to
halt
before
he
had
entirely
filled
the
aching
void
in
his
interior
department
i
could
not
fail
to
note
the
deep
anxiety
in
his
eyes
as
he
watched
me
furtively
sergeant
i
said
and
he
started
perceptibly
i
vos

he
implored

i
vos
so
hongry
as

merely

he
checked
them
off
on
the
tines
of
his
fork
occasionally
pausing
to
take
a
bite
from
the
meat
held
in
his
other
hand

i
asked
decisively
pushing
back
my
plate
and
rising
from
the
table
he
counted
them
up
with
painful
slowness
speaking
each
name
deliberately
as
if
calling
the
roll
dere
vos
twelve
captain
mit
me
but
i
am
not

said
peremptorily
you

have
fifteen
minutes
more
to
complete

up
in
half
an
hour
from
now
have
the
men
ready
for

captain
he
protested
i
vould
rattle
so
mit
my
insides
by
chiminy
dot
der
horse
vould
do
exactly
as
i
say
and
no
more
words
sergeant
and
i
turned
and
left
the
room
we
must
depart
and
at
once
more
than
ever
now
i
realized
the
necessity
for
haste
i
hoped
to
meet
the
officer
commanding
the
federal
detachment
who
had
come
to
our
aid
pay
him
the
customary
marks
of
respect
and
get
away
without
again
coming
in
contact
with
major
brennan
i
felt
myself
pledged
to
this
course
of
action
a
sentry
stationed
in
the
lower
hallway
informed
me
the
officers
were
messing
together
in
the
front
parlor
and
i
at
once
headed
that
way
i
paused
however
to
visit
the
wounded
for
a
moment
spoke
cheerily
to
my
own
men
and
then
opening
the
door
quietly
entered
the
room
which
i
had
last
left
in
possession
of
the
guerillas
with
the
exception
of
broken
windows
and
walls
little
evidence
remained
of
that
contest
which
had
raged
here
with
such
fury
but
a
few
hours
previously
there
were
numerous
dark
stains
upon
the
carpet
but
much
of
the
furniture
had
been
restored
to
place
while
a
cheerful
wood
fire
crackled
in
the
open
grate
before
it
three
men
were
sitting
smoking
while
upon
a
small
table
close
at
their
elbows
rested
a
flat
bottle
flanked
by
several
glasses
a
single
glance
sufficed
to
tell
me
they
were
federal
cavalrymen
one
being
the
lieutenant
whom
i
had
already
met
i
am
seeking
the
commander
of
this
detachment
i
explained
as
they
glanced
up
in
surprise
at
my
entrance
unannounced
i
am
captain
wayne
in
charge
of
the
confederate
troop
which
was
engaged
in
defence
of
this
a
portly
man
with
a
strong
face
and
wearing
a
closely
clipped
gray
beard
arose
from
a
comfortable
armchair
and
advanced
with
hand
extended
i
am
captain
moorehouse
in
command
he
answered
cordially
and
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
will
you
not
join
with
us
my
second
lieutenant
who
has
positive
genius
in
that
line
has
unearthed
a
few
bottles
of
rather
choice
whiskey
which
we
will
divide
most
i
thank
you
i
replied
anxious
to
meet
him
as
pleasantly
as
possible
but
i
am
eager
to
get
away
upon
my
duty
as
early
as
may
be
and
have
merely
intruded
upon
you
to
explain
my
nonsense
he
insisted
duty
is
never
quite
so
urgent
as
to
require
a
waste
of
good
liquor
captain
wayne
permit
me
to
present
my
officers
lieutenants
warren
and
starr
second
new
hampshire
cavalry
if
by
any
luck
you
were
at
gettysburg
you
have
met
i
smiled
and
accepted
the
glass
held
out
to
me
i
was
certainly
there
i
replied
in
the
same
spirit
with
which
he
had
spoken
and
now
you
recall
it
retain
a
most
vivid
recollection
of
meeting
several
federal
cavalrymen
on
that
occasion
but
believe
i
did
not
linger
to
ascertain
the
number
of
their
regiment
my
curiosity
was
completely
satisfied
before
i
reached
that
point
however
i
am
far
better
pleased
to
renew
the
acquaintance
in
this
the
ice
broken
we
continued
to
converse
freely
for
several
minutes
regarding
incidents
of
the
war
and
i
described
the
peculiar
conditions
which
had
brought
me
to
the
relief
of
brennan
party
under
other
circumstances
i
should
have
greatly
enjoyed
this
exchange
of
reminiscences
but
the
constant
haunting
fear
of
the
major
possible
entrance
at
any
moment
rendered
me
extremely
uneasy
and
anxious
to
be
away
undoubtedly
this
feeling
exhibited
itself
in
my
manner
for
captain
moorehouse
said
finally
i
realize
your
natural
anxiety
to
be
off
captain
wayne
and
while
we
should
be
very
glad
to
keep
you
with
us
indefinitely
yet
i
trust
you
will
feel
perfectly
free
in
the
i
thank
you
greatly
i
answered
rising
as
i
spoke
my
duty
is
of
such
a
nature
and
has
already
been
so
long
neglected
that
i
feel
every
moment
of
unnecessary
delay
to
be
a
crime
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
return
within
your
own
lines
and
an
early
cessation
of
i
had
shaken
hands
with
them
all
and
turned
toward
the
door
congratulating
myself
on
escaping
thus
easily
when
a
new
voice
broke
suddenly
in
upon
my
i
trust
captain
wayne
is
not
intending
to
depart
without
at
least
a
word
with
me
it
was
brennan
he
had
entered
unobserved
from
the
second
parlor
and
now
stood
leaning
with
an
almost
insolent
assumption
of
languor
against
the
sliding
door
his
eyes
fastened
upon
me
frankly
i
responded
i
had
hoped
i
his
brows
contracted
into
a
frown
of
anger
that
seemed
to
darken
his
entire
face
have
you
forgotten
then
our
compact
or
do
you
simply
elect
to
ignore
it
i
saw
the
others
exchange
quick
glances
of
amazement
but
i
answered
coolly
the
latter
supposition
is
more
nearly
the
truth
major
brennan
i
felt
that
after
what
we
have
just
passed
through
together
we
could
both
afford
to
ignore
the
past
and
consequently
was
hoping
to
escape
without
again
encountering
indeed
he
exclaimed
sarcastically
but
i
might
have
expected
it
gentlemen
and
he
turned
toward
the
expectant
group
this
man
and
i
have
a
personal
grievance
of
long
standing
unsettled
i
have
sought
him
for
months
in
vain
when
he
came
last
night
to
our
assistance
before
i
even
consented
to
accept
his
services
i
insisted
that
no
occurrence
of
the
defence
should
prevent
our
meeting
if
we
both
survived
now
he
endeavors
to
sneak
away
like
a
whipped
cur
i
demand
satisfaction
at
his
hands
and
if
it
is
refused
i
shall
denounce
him
in
both
my
cheeks
burned
but
before
i
could
control
myself
sufficiently
for
answer
moorehouse
spoke
but
brennan
see
here
he
said
anxiously
surely
captain
wayne
has
served
you
well
is
this
trouble
between
you
so
serious
that
no
amends
are
possible
none
short
of
a
personal
captain
and
the
perplexed
federal
commander
turned
toward
me
have
you
any
word
of
explanation
in
this
unfortunate
affair
very
little
i
answered
i
am
not
even
aware
that
i
have
done
injury
to
major
brennan
purposely
or
otherwise
he
has
not
so
much
as
honored
me
with
information
as
to
his
cause
for
complaint
however
i
care
very
little
what
it
may
be
as
he
has
seen
fit
to
denounce
me
before
officers
of
my
own
corps
i
should
be
extremely
glad
to
meet
him
upon
that
ground
alone
but
after
what
we
have
just
passed
through
together
i
felt
ready
to
blot
out
these
past
differences
whatever
they
may
have
been
they
are
not
liable
to
occur
again
nor
we
to
they
have
occurred
again
since
you
have
been
in
this
house
brennan
broke
forth
excitedly
you
are
not
a
coward
but
i
brand
you
here
and
now
as
sneak
and
liar
now
will
you
fight
we
stood
for
a
moment
in
utter
silence
eye
to
eye
and
i
knew
there
was
no
help
for
it
these
words
publicly
spoken
left
me
no
choice
i
am
at
your
service
major
brennan
i
returned
sternly
now
or
at
any
time
but
i
am
unfortunate
here
in
having
no
officer
of
my
army
present
and
hence
can
name
no
doubtless
one
of
these
gentlemen
will
consent
to
serve
he
said
his
face
brightening
at
my
rejoinder
there
was
a
moment
of
hesitation
natural
enough
for
they
could
scarcely
feel
like
pitting
themselves
against
a
brother
officer
in
a
quarrel
the
merits
of
which
were
so
obscure
i
was
about
to
speak
volunteering
to
stand
alone
when
some
one
hastily
pushed
a
way
to
the
front
and
lieutenant
caton
pale
but
determined
stood
at
my
shoulder
it
will
afford
me
pleasure
to
act
for
captain
wayne
he
said
clearly
if
he
will
accept
my
services
moreover
he
added
with
a
significant
glance
at
brennan
i
do
this
as
a
friend
and
with
full
confidence
that
i
am
upon
the
right
side
in
the
for
a
moment
no
one
spoke
brennan
biting
his
moustache
to
keep
back
words
he
durst
not
utter
then
caton
turned
to
me
if
you
will
retire
to
the
library
wayne
i
will
arrange
this
matter
with
whoever
may
represent
major
with
a
slight
formal
bow
to
those
present
i
quitted
the
room
chapter
xxxvi
the
last
resort
of
gentlemen
i
found
the
library
deserted
and
paced
the
floor
for
fully
half
an
hour
before
caton
appeared
stung
as
i
had
been
by
brennan
harsh
words
i
yet
shrank
from
the
thought
that
i
must
now
meet
him
in
deadly
combat
it
was
no
fear
of
personal
injury
that
troubled
me
indeed
i
do
not
recall
giving
this
the
slightest
consideration
for
my
mind
was
altogether
concentrated
upon
what
such
a
meeting
must
necessarily
mean
to
edith
brennan
and
how
it
would
affect
all
our
future
relationship
this
was
the
thought
that
swayed
and
mastered
me
i
had
pledged
myself
to
avoid
him
and
indeed
had
used
every
means
possible
to
that
end
i
was
even
willing
to
go
forth
stamped
by
his
denunciation
rather
than
involve
her
in
such
controversy
but
the
effort
was
fruitless
and
i
must
now
stand
before
him
or
else
forever
forfeit
my
manhood
thus
the
die
was
already
cast
yet
in
one
point
i
might
still
prove
true
to
the
spirit
of
my
pledge
and
retain
her
approbation
i
could
permit
my
antagonist
to
leave
the
field
unscathed
one
who
does
not
realize
my
feelings
toward
this
man
my
fierce
resentment
of
every
indignity
he
had
heaped
upon
me
my
intense
rivalry
and
my
burning
desire
to
punish
him
for
a
hundred
mental
wounds
can
not
comprehend
how
difficult
a
battle
i
fought
in
those
few
moments
in
order
that
i
might
conquer
myself
the
time
was
none
too
long
yet
my
mind
once
thoroughly
settled
as
to
my
duty
to
her
i
became
calm
again
and
confident
as
to
the
outcome
when
caton
entered
flushed
and
visibly
excited
from
what
had
evidently
proven
an
acrimonious
controversy
i
greeted
him
with
a
smile
you
appear
to
have
experienced
difficulties
in
regard
to
details
i
said
curiously
there
was
much
unnecessary
talk
he
admitted
but
matters
have
been
at
last
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
you
are
to
meet
at
once
in
the
rear
of
the
big
tobacco
shed
a
spot
entirely
removed
from
observation
i
have
been
compelled
to
accept
pistols
as
the
weapons
as
we
have
nothing
else
here
at
all
suitable
for
the
purpose
cavalry
sabres
being
far
too
cumbersome
lieutenant
starr
chances
to
possess
two
derringers
exactly
alike
which
we
have
mutually
agreed
upon
i
hope
this
is
satisfactory
to
you
wayne
i
am
not
precisely
an
expert
but
that
does
not
greatly
matter
who
acts
for
brennan
captain
moorehouse
rather
against
his
will
i
very
well
caton
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
and
am
indeed
greatly
obliged
to
you
yet
before
we
go
out
i
desire
to
speak
a
word
or
two
with
the
utmost
i
stood
facing
him
my
hand
resting
lightly
upon
the
my
eyes
reading
his
expressive
face
as
my
second
i
wish
you
to
comprehend
fully
my
actions
and
the
motives
that
inspire
them
if
they
are
in
any
way
unsatisfactory
to
your
mind
you
may
feel
at
perfect
liberty
to
withhold
your
services
i
am
now
and
always
have
been
opposed
to
duelling
i
believe
it
wrong
in
principle
and
a
travesty
upon
justice
but
it
is
a
custom
of
the
south
a
requirement
among
officers
of
our
army
and
after
what
has
just
occurred
between
major
brennan
and
myself
i
can
not
honorably
refuse
any
longer
to
go
out
major
brennan
has
deliberately
placed
me
in
a
position
where
i
can
not
avoid
meeting
him
without
losing
all
standing
in
my
corps
i
sought
to
escape
but
was
prevented
by
accident
now
i
simply
yield
to
the
inevitable
i
feel
confident
you
will
not
misconstrue
these
words
you
surely
know
me
sufficiently
well
so
as
not
to
attribute
them
to
cowardice
i
shall
face
him
exactly
in
accordance
with
your
arrangements
asking
nothing
upon
my
part
yielding
him
every
satisfaction
he
can
possibly
desire
but
i
shall
fire
in
the
he
stared
at
me
incredulously
his
face
a
perfect
picture
of
amazement
but
wayne
he
stammered
are
you
aware
that
major
brennan
is
an
expert
with
the
pistol
that
he
holds
the
sixth
corps
trophy
do
you
realize
that
he
goes
out
deliberately
intending
to
kill
you
i
was
not
posted
as
to
the
first
fact
you
mention
but
have
never
entertained
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
the
other
however
they
do
not
in
the
least
affect
my
but
man
it
will
be
murder
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
sanctioned
that
is
exactly
why
i
told
you
i
said
calmly
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
stand
alone
and
absolve
you
from
all
responsibility
yet
i
do
not
desire
you
to
suppose
that
i
am
at
all
quixotic
in
this
there
is
a
personal
reason
why
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
risk
my
life
rather
than
injure
major
his
troubled
eyes
studied
me
intently
and
then
his
face
suddenly
brightened
with
a
new
thought
wayne
he
asked
placing
his
hand
upon
my
arm
familiarly
is
it
brennan
for
an
instant
i
hesitated
but
his
manly
honest
countenance
reassured
me
between
us
only
it
is
i
answered
gravely
but
not
the
slightest
blame
attaches
to
i
do
not
wholly
understand
he
said
at
last
yet
i
do
not
doubt
you
may
be
perfectly
right
in
your
he
extended
his
hand
impulsively
i
know
you
to
be
a
good
soldier
and
a
true
gentleman
i
will
stand
with
you
wayne
but
i
pledge
this
if
he
takes
advantage
treacherously
and
you
fall
as
god
forbid
i
will
face
him
myself
and
when
i
do
there
shall
be
no
firing
in
the
i
wrung
his
hand
silently
and
my
heart
went
out
in
unspeakable
gratitude
to
this
noble
fellow
who
wearing
the
uniform
of
an
enemy
had
constantly
proven
himself
my
sincere
friend
your
words
strengthen
me
greatly
i
managed
to
say
at
last
now
let
us
go
and
not
keep
the
others
i
do
not
remember
that
we
spoke
save
once
while
we
passed
out
through
the
orchard
into
the
field
where
the
big
tobacco
shed
stood
a
group
of
soldiers
were
digging
a
grave
behind
one
of
the
negro
cabins
but
other
than
these
we
saw
no
one
it
was
as
we
paused
a
moment
to
refasten
the
gate
that
i
finally
broke
the
silence
between
us
in
the
inner
pocket
of
my
shirt
i
said
you
will
find
directions
which
will
enable
you
to
communicate
with
my
his
eyes
instantly
filled
with
tears
do
say
that
wayne
he
protested
i
will
not
believe
it
is
destined
to
end
i
certainly
trust
it
is
not
i
answered
smiling
at
him
and
deeply
touched
by
his
show
of
genuine
feeling
but
i
have
only
you
to
rely
upon
in
this
matter
if
by
any
chance
it
the
deserted
field
we
were
compelled
to
cross
had
long
been
neglected
and
was
now
thickly
overgrown
with
weeds
not
until
we
turned
the
corner
of
the
great
ramshackle
building
which
in
other
and
more
prosperous
days
had
been
dedicated
to
the
curing
of
the
leaf
did
we
perceive
any
signs
of
the
presence
of
our
antagonists
they
were
standing
upon
the
farther
side
directly
opposite
the
door
and
both
bowed
slightly
as
we
approached
the
captain
came
toward
us
slowly
it
is
to
be
greatly
regretted
gentlemen
he
said
with
ceremonious
politeness
that
we
have
no
surgeon
with
us
however
neither
contestant
has
any
advantage
in
this
respect
lieutenant
caton
may
i
ask
if
the
arrangements
as
already
completed
have
proven
satisfactory
to
your
principal
entirely
then
if
you
will
kindly
step
this
way
a
moment
we
will
confer
as
to
certain
brennan
was
leaning
in
negligent
attitude
against
the
side
of
the
building
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
ground
the
blue
smoke
of
a
cigar
curling
lazily
above
his
head
i
glanced
toward
him
and
then
sought
to
amuse
myself
watching
the
queer
antics
of
a
gray
squirrel
on
the
rail
fence
beyond
i
felt
no
desire
for
further
thought
only
an
intense
anxiety
for
them
to
hurry
the
preliminaries
and
have
the
affair
settled
as
speedily
as
possible
i
was
aroused
by
moorehouse
rather
nasal
voice
gentlemen
will
you
please
take
your
positions
major
brennan
you
will
stand
three
paces
to
the
right
of
that
sapling
facing
directly
south
captain
wayne
kindly
walk
straight
west
from
the
shed
door
until
you
come
opposite
the
major
i
noted
brennan
throw
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
then
i
walked
slowly
forward
until
i
reached
the
point
assigned
me
my
heart
was
beating
fast
now
for
i
fully
realized
the
probabilities
of
the
next
few
minutes
and
felt
little
doubt
that
serious
injury
if
not
death
was
to
be
my
portion
yet
my
trained
nerves
did
not
fail
me
and
outwardly
i
appeared
fully
as
cool
and
deliberate
as
my
opponent
years
of
constant
exposure
to
peril
in
every
form
had
yielded
me
a
grim
philosophy
of
fatalism
that
now
stood
me
in
most
excellent
stead
indeed
i
doubt
not
had
i
chosen
to
put
it
to
the
test
my
hand
would
have
proven
the
steadier
of
the
two
for
brennan
face
was
flushed
and
he
plainly
exhibited
the
intense
animosity
with
which
he
confronted
me
how
peculiarly
the
mind
often
operates
in
such
moments
of
exciting
suspense
i
recall
remarking
a
very
slight
stoop
in
brennan
shoulders
which
i
had
never
perceived
before
i
remember
wondering
where
moorehouse
had
ever
discovered
a
tailor
to
give
so
shocking
a
fit
to
his
coat
and
finally
i
grew
almost
interested
in
two
birds
perched
upon
the
limb
of
a
tree
opposite
where
i
stood
i
even
smiled
to
myself
over
a
jest
one
of
the
young
officers
had
made
an
hour
before
yet
with
it
all
i
remained
keenly
observant
and
fully
aware
of
each
movement
made
by
the
others
on
the
field
i
saw
caton
accept
the
derringer
handed
him
and
test
it
carefully
the
long
slim
blue
barrel
looking
deadly
enough
as
he
held
it
up
between
me
and
the
sky
then
moorehouse
approached
brennan
with
its
fellow
in
his
grasp
and
the
lieutenant
crossed
over
and
stood
beside
me
here
is
the
gun
wayne
he
said
and
i
sincerely
hope
you
have
changed
your
decision
there
is
no
mercy
in
brennan
so
i
notice
i
answered
taking
the
derringer
from
him
and
examining
it
with
some
curiosity
but
i
shall
do
as
i
said
nevertheless
it
is
not
any
sentiment
of
mercy
i
feel
which
spares
him
but
a
duty
that
appeals
to
me
even
more
strongly
than
by
heaven
i
wish
it
were
i
remained
silent
for
i
could
not
say
in
my
heart
that
i
echoed
his
wish
and
i
cared
not
to
go
down
in
another
minute
with
a
lie
upon
my
lips
the
love
of
edith
brennan
which
i
now
felt
assured
was
mine
was
sweeter
far
to
me
than
life
who
gives
the
word
i
questioned
i
do
are
you
ready
i
held
out
my
hand
and
his
fingers
closed
upon
it
with
warm
friendly
grip
the
next
moment
brennan
and
i
stood
seemingly
alone
facing
each
other
as
motionless
as
two
statues
his
coat
was
buttoned
to
the
throat
his
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
his
pistol
hand
hanging
straight
down
at
his
side
his
gaze
never
wavering
from
me
i
knew
he
was
coolly
deliberately
measuring
the
distance
between
us
with
as
deadly
a
purpose
as
any
murderer
the
almost
painful
stillness
was
broken
by
caton
and
i
marked
the
tremor
in
his
voice
are
you
both
ready
gentlemen
i
am
said
brennan
ready
i
replied
the
word
will
be
one
two
three
fire
with
a
slight
pause
after
the
three
a
report
from
either
pistol
before
the
final
word
is
spoken
i
shall
take
personally
be
prepared
there
was
a
moment
pause
so
still
was
it
i
heard
the
chirping
of
birds
overhead
and
the
flutter
of
a
leaf
as
it
fell
swirling
at
my
feet
i
saw
brennan
as
through
a
mist
and
in
its
undulations
there
seemed
to
be
pictures
of
the
face
of
his
wife
as
if
her
spirit
hovered
there
between
us
to
have
shot
then
would
have
been
like
piercing
her
before
reaching
him
ready
said
the
voice
once
more
and
as
i
saw
brennan
arm
slowly
rise
i
lifted
mine
also
and
covered
him
noting
as
i
did
so
almost
in
wonder
with
what
steadiness
of
nerve
and
wrist
i
held
the
slender
gauge
just
beneath
the
visor
of
his
cap
deliberately
as
though
he
dreaded
the
necessity
caton
counted
one
two
three
my
pistol
exploded
the
charge
striking
the
limb
above
him
and
i
staggered
backward
my
hat
torn
from
my
head
a
white
line
cut
through
my
hair
and
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
upon
my
temple
i
saw
caton
rushing
toward
me
his
face
filled
with
anxiety
and
then
brennan
hurled
his
yet
smoking
derringer
into
the
dirt
at
his
feet
with
an
oath
damn
it
moorehouse
he
roared
fairly
beside
himself
the
charge
was
too
heavy
it
are
you
much
hurt
panted
caton
merely
pricked
the
then
brennan
angry
voice
rang
out
once
more
i
demand
another
shot
he
insisted
loudly
i
demand
it
i
tell
you
moorehouse
this
settles
nothing
and
i
will
not
be
balked
just
because
you
do
know
enough
to
load
a
caton
wheeled
upon
him
his
blue
eyes
blazing
dangerously
you
demand
a
second
shot
he
cried
indignantly
are
you
not
aware
sir
that
captain
wayne
fired
in
the
air
it
would
be
fired
in
the
air
he
laughed
as
if
it
was
a
most
excellent
joke
of
course
he
did
but
it
was
because
my
ball
disconcerted
his
aim
i
fired
a
second
the
first
but
his
derringer
was
covering
caton
strode
toward
him
his
face
white
with
passion
let
him
have
it
his
way
i
called
after
him
for
now
my
own
blood
was
up
i
shall
not
be
guilty
of
such
neglect
he
did
not
heed
me
perhaps
he
did
not
hear
major
brennan
he
said
facing
him
his
voice
trembling
with
feeling
i
tell
you
captain
wayne
purposely
shot
in
the
air
he
informed
me
before
coming
upon
the
field
that
he
should
do
so
i
positively
refuse
to
permit
him
to
face
your
fire
brennan
face
blazed
chagrin
anger
disappointment
fairly
infuriated
him
and
he
seemed
to
lose
all
this
is
some
cowardly
trick
he
roared
glaring
about
him
as
if
seeking
some
one
upon
whom
he
could
vent
his
wrath
damn
it
i
believe
my
pistol
was
fixed
to
overshoot
in
order
to
save
that
fellow
i
never
missed
such
a
shot
moorehouse
broke
in
upon
his
raving
so
astounded
at
these
intemperate
words
as
to
stutter
in
his
speech
you
to
major
brennan
he
began
that
i
have
he
paused
his
mouth
wide
open
staring
toward
the
shed
involuntarily
we
glanced
in
that
direction
also
wondering
what
he
saw
there
in
the
open
doorway
as
in
a
frame
dressed
almost
entirely
in
white
her
graceful
figure
and
fair
young
face
clearly
defined
against
the
dark
background
stood
edith
brennan
chapter
xxxvii
the
last
she
exhibited
no
outward
sign
of
agitation
as
she
left
her
position
and
slowly
advanced
toward
us
however
fiercely
her
heart
may
have
beaten
she
remained
apparently
calm
and
composed
never
before
had
i
felt
so
completely
dominated
by
her
womanly
spirit
while
her
very
presence
upon
the
field
hushed
in
an
instant
the
breathings
of
dispute
she
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
either
brennan
or
myself
but
ignored
us
totally
as
she
drew
near
daintily
lifting
her
skirts
to
keep
them
from
contact
with
the
weeds
under
foot
her
head
poised
proudly
her
eyes
a
bit
disdainful
of
it
all
she
paused
before
caton
lieutenant
she
questioned
in
a
clear
tone
which
seemed
to
command
an
answer
i
have
always
found
you
an
impartial
friend
will
you
kindly
inform
me
as
to
the
true
meaning
of
all
this
he
hesitated
hardly
knowing
what
to
reply
but
her
imperious
eyes
were
upon
him
they
insisted
and
he
stammered
lamely
two
of
the
gentlemen
madam
were
about
to
settle
a
slight
disagreement
by
means
of
the
were
about
she
echoed
scornful
of
all
deceit
surely
i
heard
shots
as
i
came
through
the
orchard
one
fire
has
been
exchanged
he
reluctantly
admitted
and
captain
wayne
has
been
wounded
i
was
not
aware
until
that
moment
that
she
had
even
so
much
as
noticed
my
presence
very
slightly
his
opponent
escaped
uninjured
caton
bowed
glanced
uneasily
toward
me
and
then
blurted
forth
impulsively
captain
wayne
fired
in
the
air
she
never
glanced
toward
where
i
stood
yet
i
instantly
marked
the
quick
droop
of
her
eyes
the
faint
pink
that
overspread
her
cheek
this
slight
confusion
unnoted
save
by
eyes
of
love
was
but
momentary
still
it
was
sufficient
to
apprise
me
that
she
both
understood
and
approved
my
action
a
most
delightful
situation
surely
she
said
clearly
and
sarcastically
one
would
almost
suppose
we
had
wholly
reverted
to
barbarism
and
that
our
boasted
civilization
was
but
mockery
think
of
it
and
the
proud
disdain
in
her
face
held
us
silent
not
six
hours
ago
that
house
yonder
was
the
scene
of
a
desperate
battle
within
its
rooms
men
fought
and
died
cheering
in
their
agony
like
heroes
of
romance
i
saw
there
two
men
battling
shoulder
to
shoulder
against
a
host
of
infuriated
ruffians
seeking
to
protect
helpless
women
they
wore
different
uniforms
they
followed
different
flags
by
the
fortune
of
war
they
were
enemies
yet
they
could
fight
and
die
in
defence
of
the
weak
i
thanked
god
upon
my
knees
that
i
had
been
privileged
to
know
such
men
and
could
call
them
friends
no
nobler
truer
manlier
deed
at
arms
was
ever
done
yet
mark
you
no
sooner
is
that
duty
over
scarcely
are
their
dead
comrades
buried
when
they
forget
every
natural
instinct
of
gratitude
of
true
manliness
and
spring
at
each
other
throat
like
two
maddened
beasts
i
care
not
what
the
cause
may
be
the
act
is
shameful
and
an
insult
to
every
woman
of
this
household
even
as
i
came
upon
the
field
voices
were
clamoring
for
another
shot
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
one
man
stood
already
wounded
war
may
be
excusable
but
this
is
not
war
gentlemen
you
have
fired
your
last
shot
on
this
field
unless
you
choose
to
make
me
your
i
would
that
i
possessed
a
picture
of
that
scene
a
picture
which
would
show
the
varied
expressions
of
countenance
as
those
scornful
words
lashed
us
she
stood
there
as
a
queen
might
and
commanded
an
obedience
no
man
among
us
durst
refuse
brennan
flushed
face
paled
and
his
lips
trembled
as
he
sought
to
make
excuse
but
edith
he
protested
you
do
not
know
you
do
not
understand
there
are
wrongs
which
can
be
righted
in
no
other
i
do
not
care
to
know
she
answered
coldly
nor
do
i
ever
expect
to
learn
that
murder
can
right
a
murder
you
use
strong
terms
the
code
has
been
recognized
for
centuries
as
the
last
resort
of
the
code
has
it
indeed
what
gentlemen
those
of
the
south
exclusively
of
late
that
might
possibly
pardon
your
opponent
but
not
you
for
you
know
very
well
that
in
the
north
no
man
of
any
standing
would
ever
venture
to
resort
to
it
moreover
even
the
code
presupposes
that
men
shall
stand
equal
at
its
bar
i
am
informed
that
captain
wayne
fired
in
the
he
hesitated
feeling
doubtless
the
uselessness
of
further
protest
yet
she
permitted
him
small
opportunity
for
consideration
major
she
said
quietly
but
firmly
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
escort
me
to
the
these
words
gently
as
they
were
spoken
still
constituted
a
command
her
eyes
were
upon
his
face
and
i
doubt
not
he
read
within
them
that
he
would
forfeit
all
her
respect
if
he
failed
to
obey
yet
he
yielded
with
exceeding
poor
grace
as
it
seems
impossible
to
continue
he
admitted
bitterly
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
he
turned
and
fronted
me
his
eyes
glowing
but
understand
sir
this
is
merely
a
cessation
not
an
i
bowed
gravely
not
daring
to
trust
my
voice
in
speech
lest
i
should
yield
to
the
temptation
of
my
own
temper
captain
wayne
she
said
glancing
back
across
his
broad
blue
shoulder
and
i
thought
there
was
a
new
quality
in
her
voice
the
sting
had
someway
gone
out
of
it
i
shall
esteem
it
a
kindness
if
you
will
call
upon
me
before
you
with
pleasure
i
hastened
to
reply
my
surprise
at
the
request
almost
robbing
me
of
speech
but
i
shall
be
compelled
to
leave
at
once
as
my
troop
is
already
under
i
shall
detain
you
for
only
a
moment
but
after
what
you
have
passed
through
on
our
behalf
i
am
unwilling
you
should
depart
without
realizing
our
gratitude
you
will
find
me
in
the
library
come
frank
i
am
ready
we
remained
motionless
watching
them
until
they
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
shed
brennan
walked
with
stern
face
his
step
heavy
she
with
averted
eyes
a
slight
smile
of
triumph
curling
her
lip
then
moorehouse
stooped
and
picked
up
the
derringer
the
major
had
thrown
away
by
thunder
but
she
right
he
exclaimed
emphatically
i
tell
you
that
a
mighty
fine
woman
blame
me
if
she
did
face
us
like
a
no
one
answered
and
without
exchanging
another
word
we
walked
together
to
the
house
there
i
found
the
remnant
of
my
troop
standing
beside
their
horses
chaffing
with
a
dozen
idle
yankee
cavalrymen
who
were
lounging
on
the
wide
steps
the
time
had
come
when
i
must
say
a
final
farewell
and
depart
not
the
slightest
excuse
remained
for
further
delay
i
dreaded
the
ordeal
but
no
escape
was
possible
and
i
entered
the
house
for
what
i
well
knew
was
to
be
the
last
time
my
mind
was
gravely
troubled
i
knew
not
what
to
expect
how
far
i
might
venture
to
hope
why
had
she
desired
to
see
me
again
surely
the
public
reason
she
offered
could
not
be
the
real
one
was
it
to
confess
that
i
had
won
her
heart
or
to
show
me
by
scornful
words
her
indignation
at
my
folly
what
should
i
say
how
could
i
act
in
her
presence
these
and
a
hundred
other
queries
arose
to
perplex
me
had
she
only
been
free
a
maid
whose
hand
remained
her
own
to
surrender
as
she
pleased
i
should
never
have
hesitated
never
have
doubted
her
purpose
but
now
that
could
not
be
i
felt
that
every
word
and
look
between
us
already
bordered
upon
sin
that
danger
to
both
alike
lurked
in
each
stolen
glance
and
meeting
better
far
we
should
have
parted
without
further
speech
i
knew
this
yet
love
constrained
me
as
it
has
constrained
many
another
and
i
lingered
at
her
wish
a
foolish
moth
fluttering
to
the
flame
as
i
knocked
almost
timidly
at
the
closed
library
door
a
gentle
voice
said
come
and
i
entered
my
heart
throbbing
like
a
frightened
girl
she
stood
waiting
me
nearly
in
the
centre
of
that
spacious
apartment
dressed
in
the
same
light
raiment
she
had
worn
without
and
her
greeting
was
calm
and
friendly
yet
tinged
by
a
proud
dignity
i
can
not
describe
i
believed
for
an
instant
that
we
were
alone
and
my
blood
raced
through
my
veins
in
sudden
expectancy
then
my
eyes
fell
upon
minor
comfortably
seated
in
an
armchair
before
the
fire
and
i
realized
that
she
was
present
to
restrain
me
from
forgetfulness
but
in
very
truth
my
lady
hardly
needed
such
protection
her
speech
her
manner
her
proud
constraint
told
me
at
once
most
plainly
that
no
existing
tie
between
us
had
caused
our
meeting
captain
wayne
she
said
softly
her
high
color
alone
giving
evidence
of
any
memory
of
the
past
i
scarcely
thought
that
we
should
meet
again
yet
was
not
willing
to
part
with
you
under
any
misunderstanding
i
have
learned
from
lieutenant
caton
the
full
particulars
of
your
action
in
connection
with
major
brennan
i
wish
you
to
realize
that
i
appreciate
your
efforts
to
escape
a
hostile
meeting
and
esteem
you
most
highly
for
your
forbearance
on
the
field
it
was
indeed
a
noble
proof
of
true
courage
may
i
ask
why
did
you
fire
in
the
air
had
she
not
held
me
so
away
from
her
by
her
manner
i
should
have
then
and
there
told
her
all
the
truth
as
it
was
i
durst
not
i
felt
convinced
that
if
my
bullet
reached
major
brennan
it
would
injure
you
i
preferred
not
to
do
she
bowed
gravely
while
a
kinder
look
if
i
may
use
that
expression
seemed
to
dominate
her
face
i
believed
it
was
for
my
sake
you
made
the
she
paused
then
asked
in
yet
lower
tones
was
my
name
mentioned
during
your
contention
i
mean
publicly
it
was
not
caton
alone
is
aware
i
refrained
because
of
the
reason
i
have
already
given
your
wound
is
not
serious
too
insignificant
to
be
worthy
of
she
was
silent
her
eyes
upon
the
carpet
her
bosom
rising
and
falling
with
the
emotion
she
sought
in
vain
to
suppress
i
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
she
said
finally
i
shall
understand
it
all
better
comprehend
your
motive
better
for
this
brief
talk
whatever
you
may
think
of
me
in
the
future
and
she
held
out
her
hand
with
something
of
the
old
frankness
in
the
gesture
do
not
hold
me
as
ungrateful
for
a
single
kindness
you
have
shown
me
i
have
not
fully
understood
you
captain
wayne
indeed
i
doubt
if
i
do
even
now
yet
i
am
under
great
obligations
which
i
hope
some
day
to
be
able
to
requite
at
least
in
a
thousand
times
they
are
already
paid
i
exclaimed
eagerly
forgetting
for
the
moment
the
presence
of
her
silent
chaperon
you
have
given
me
that
which
is
more
than
life
do
not
captain
wayne
she
interrupted
her
cheeks
aflame
i
would
rather
forget
please
do
not
i
did
not
send
to
you
for
that
only
to
tell
you
i
knew
and
understood
we
must
part
now
will
you
say
goodbye
if
you
bid
me
yes
i
will
say
i
answered
my
own
brought
back
instantly
by
her
words
and
manner
but
i
retain
that
which
i
do
not
mean
to
forget
your
gracious
words
of
invitation
to
the
she
stood
with
parted
lips
as
though
she
struggled
to
force
back
that
which
should
not
be
uttered
then
she
whispered
swiftly
it
is
not
my
wish
that
you
was
there
ever
such
another
paradox
of
a
woman
i
knew
not
how
to
read
her
aright
for
i
scarce
ever
found
her
twice
the
same
which
represented
the
truth
of
her
character
her
cool
dignity
her
impetuous
pride
or
that
gentle
tenderness
which
befitted
her
so
well
which
was
the
armor
which
the
heart
of
this
fair
lady
of
the
north
as
we
rode
down
the
path
to
the
eastward
a
snowy
handkerchief
fluttered
for
an
instant
at
the
library
window
i
raised
my
hat
in
silent
greeting
and
we
were
gone
chapter
xxxviii
the
furling
of
the
flags
the
close
of
the
long
and
bitter
struggle
had
come
to
those
who
had
cast
their
fortunes
with
the
south
it
seemed
almost
as
the
end
of
the
world
i
had
thought
to
write
of
those
last
sad
days
to
picture
them
in
all
their
contrasting
light
and
shadow
but
now
i
can
not
there
are
thoughts
too
deep
for
human
utterance
memories
too
sacred
for
the
pen
i
rejoice
that
i
was
a
part
of
it
that
to
the
lowering
of
the
last
tattered
i
remained
constant
to
the
best
traditions
of
my
house
i
can
not
sit
here
now
beneath
the
protecting
shadow
of
a
flag
for
which
my
son
fought
and
died
and
write
that
i
regret
the
ending
for
years
of
peace
have
taught
us
of
the
south
lessons
no
less
valuable
than
did
the
war
yet
do
i
rejoice
that
having
once
donned
the
gray
i
wore
it
until
the
last
shotted
gun
voiced
its
grim
message
to
the
north
it
is
hardly
more
than
a
dream
now
sometimes
vague
and
shadowy
again
distinct
with
living
figures
and
historic
scenes
i
require
but
to
close
my
eyes
to
behold
once
more
those
slender
lines
of
ragged
weary
hungry
men
to
whom
fighting
had
become
synonymous
with
life
i
pass
again
through
the
fiery
rain
of
those
last
fierce
battles
when
in
desperation
we
sought
to
check
the
unnumbered
blue
legions
that
fairly
crushed
us
beneath
their
weight
the
vividness
of
the
memory
burns
my
brain
as
by
fire
the
ghastly
faces
of
the
dead
the
unuttered
agony
of
the
wounded
the
patient
suffering
of
the
living
day
by
day
night
by
night
we
grew
less
in
numbers
and
our
thin
lines
contracted
divisions
shrank
into
regiments
companies
to
platoons
men
knew
that
the
inevitable
was
upon
them
yet
smiled
into
one
another
face
and
went
forth
to
die
it
was
pitiable
it
was
magnificent
hungry
we
fought
unsheltered
we
slept
our
dead
were
lying
with
the
enemy
while
we
who
yet
lived
for
the
duty
of
another
day
fronted
the
bayonets
with
hearts
of
courage
and
sadly
prophetic
souls
everywhere
to
front
and
rear
to
left
and
right
stretched
that
same
blue
wall
tipped
with
cruel
steel
in
constant
hail
of
iron
the
shells
fell
upon
us
darkening
the
and
turning
night
into
a
hell
of
flame
there
was
no
retreat
no
loophole
of
escape
we
could
but
stay
suffer
and
perish
like
men
afflicted
with
some
incurable
malady
we
who
were
of
that
stricken
remnant
sternly
grimly
looked
into
the
eyes
of
death
and
waited
for
the
end
i
saw
it
all
i
held
a
part
in
it
all
upon
that
april
day
which
witnessed
the
turning
of
the
last
sad
page
in
this
tragedy
i
stood
without
the
mclean
house
ankle
deep
in
the
trampled
mud
of
the
yard
surrounded
by
a
group
of
federal
officers
within
was
my
commander
the
old
gray
hero
of
virginia
together
with
the
great
silent
soldier
of
the
north
few
about
me
spoke
as
we
waited
in
restless
agony
no
one
addressed
me
and
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
look
in
my
face
which
held
them
dumb
we
knew
well
what
hung
upon
the
balance
then
that
within
those
humble
walls
was
being
consummated
one
of
the
great
events
of
history
to
the
men
in
blue
it
meant
home
and
victory
and
peace
to
those
in
gray
suffering
and
struggle
and
defeat
i
know
not
how
long
i
waited
standing
beside
my
horse
with
head
half
bowed
upon
his
neck
seeing
the
figures
about
me
as
in
a
dream
at
last
the
door
was
flung
open
and
those
within
came
forth
he
was
in
advance
of
them
all
in
that
pale
stern
kindly
face
and
within
the
depths
of
those
sorrowful
gray
eyes
i
read
instantly
the
truth
army
of
northern
virginia
was
no
yet
with
what
calm
dignity
did
this
defeated
chieftain
pass
down
that
blue
lane
his
head
erect
his
eyes
undimmed
as
dauntless
in
that
awful
hour
of
surrender
as
when
he
rode
before
his
cheering
legions
of
fighting
men
only
as
he
came
to
where
i
stood
and
caught
the
look
of
suffering
upon
my
face
did
he
once
falter
and
then
i
noted
no
more
than
the
slight
twitching
of
his
lips
beneath
the
short
gray
beard
captain
wayne
he
said
with
all
his
courtesy
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
to
ride
to
general
hills
division
and
request
him
to
cease
all
firing
at
i
turned
reluctantly
away
from
him
knowing
full
well
in
my
heart
i
was
bearing
my
last
order
and
rode
at
a
hard
trot
down
the
road
between
long
lines
of
waiting
federal
infantry
i
scarcely
so
much
as
saw
them
for
my
head
was
bent
low
over
the
saddle
pommel
and
my
eyes
were
blurred
with
tears
the
sun
lay
hot
and
golden
over
the
dusty
roads
and
fenceless
fields
the
air
was
vocal
with
blare
of
trumpets
and
roll
of
drums
while
everywhere
the
eye
rested
upon
blue
lines
and
long
columns
of
marching
troops
i
formed
one
of
a
little
gray
squad
moving
slowly
southward
a
mere
fragment
of
the
fighting
men
of
the
confederacy
making
their
way
homeward
as
best
they
might
as
the
roads
forked
i
left
them
for
here
our
paths
diverged
and
it
chanced
i
was
the
only
one
whose
hope
lay
westward
silently
thoughtfully
i
trudged
on
for
an
hour
through
the
thick
red
dust
my
horse
sorely
wounded
in
our
last
skirmish
limped
painfully
behind
me
his
flung
carelessly
over
my
arm
out
yonder
where
the
sun
pointed
the
way
with
streams
of
fire
i
was
to
take
up
life
anew
life
what
was
there
left
to
me
in
that
word
a
deserted
despoiled
farm
alone
awaited
my
coming
hardly
a
remembered
face
scarcely
a
future
hope
the
glitter
of
a
passing
troop
of
cavalry
drew
my
mind
for
an
instant
to
edith
brennan
but
i
crushed
the
thought
even
were
she
free
what
had
i
now
to
place
at
her
proud
feet
i
a
penniless
defeated
homeless
man
no
that
was
all
over
even
as
the
cause
for
which
i
had
fought
love
and
ambition
must
lie
buried
in
the
same
grave
the
clothes
i
wore
that
tattered
suit
of
faded
gray
soiled
by
months
of
hard
service
in
the
open
was
all
i
possessed
in
the
wide
world
save
the
starved
and
wounded
animal
limping
dejectedly
at
my
heels
the
mere
conception
of
it
the
picture
of
kneeling
thus
attired
at
her
feet
brought
with
it
a
grim
smile
which
a
deep
heartache
instantly
chased
away
besides
she
was
not
free
and
no
dream
of
love
might
inspire
me
to
toil
and
hope
with
clinched
teeth
i
drove
her
memory
from
me
back
into
that
dim
past
where
lurked
all
that
had
been
worthy
in
my
life
sternly
i
resolved
that
her
face
should
henceforth
abide
with
those
others
the
shadowy
comrades
of
many
a
battlefield
in
this
spirit
i
plodded
on
my
step
heavy
my
head
bowed
wearied
alike
in
heart
and
body
my
temples
throbbed
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
my
eyes
were
dulled
my
throat
caked
by
the
swirling
dust
at
a
a
federal
picket
halted
me
and
i
aroused
sufficiently
to
hand
him
the
paper
which
entitled
me
to
safe
passage
through
the
lines
he
was
a
man
well
along
in
years
with
thoughtful
eyes
and
kindly
face
and
i
spoke
to
him
out
of
my
sheer
loneliness
no
doubt
you
are
rejoicing
that
the
long
struggle
is
so
nearly
ended
i
said
as
he
handed
me
back
the
paper
and
motioned
me
to
pass
on
have
you
a
family
in
the
north
a
wife
and
five
children
up
in
michigan
sir
he
answered
civilly
i
guess
they
are
counting
the
days
now
and
you
sir
oh
i
have
some
acres
of
land
over
yonder
and
but
little
well
you
a
sight
better
off
than
some
i
it
been
pretty
tough
on
all
of
you
but
if
you
fellows
only
work
like
you
fought
have
things
a
humming
before
there
was
homely
comfort
in
his
philosophy
which
for
the
moment
cheered
me
perhaps
he
was
right
the
energy
and
bravery
of
the
south
crippled
as
it
now
was
might
yet
conquer
our
present
misfortune
and
prove
it
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
or
more
this
thought
still
in
my
mind
when
i
became
aware
that
he
was
calling
after
me
hey
there
you
he
shouted
hold
on
a
bit
as
i
came
to
a
pause
and
glanced
back
wondering
if
there
could
be
anything
wrong
with
my
parole
he
swung
his
cap
and
pointed
that
officer
coming
yonder
wants
to
speak
with
across
the
open
field
at
my
right
hidden
until
then
by
a
slight
rise
of
ground
a
mounted
cavalryman
was
riding
rapidly
toward
me
the
wind
blowing
back
his
cape
so
as
to
make
conspicuous
its
bright
yellow
lining
for
the
moment
his
lowered
head
prevented
recognition
but
as
he
cleared
the
ditch
and
came
up
smiling
i
saw
it
was
caton
by
jove
wayne
but
this
is
lucky
he
exclaimed
springing
to
the
ground
beside
me
i
actually
been
praying
for
a
week
past
that
i
might
meet
you
holmes
of
your
service
told
me
you
had
pulled
through
but
everything
is
in
such
confusion
that
to
hunt
for
you
would
have
been
the
proverbial
quest
after
a
needle
in
a
haystack
you
have
been
paroled
then
yes
i
completely
out
of
it
at
last
i
answered
feeling
to
the
full
the
deep
sympathy
expressed
by
his
face
it
was
a
bitter
pill
but
one
which
had
to
be
i
know
it
old
fellow
and
his
on
mine
tightened
warmly
of
course
i
glad
there
no
use
denying
that
glad
we
won
glad
the
old
union
has
been
preserved
as
our
fathers
gave
it
to
us
glad
slavery
on
this
continent
has
passed
away
for
ever
and
so
will
you
be
before
you
die
yet
i
am
sincerely
sorry
for
those
who
have
given
their
all
and
lost
god
knows
you
fought
a
good
fight
fought
as
americans
only
can
even
though
it
was
in
a
bad
cause
that
is
the
pity
of
it
such
heroism
such
sacrifice
and
all
wasted
if
you
have
been
beaten
there
is
no
disgrace
in
it
for
no
other
nation
in
this
world
could
ever
have
accomplished
it
but
this
was
a
case
of
greek
meeting
greek
and
we
had
the
money
the
resources
and
the
men
but
wayne
i
tell
you
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
spark
of
bitterness
in
the
heart
of
a
fighting
federal
soldier
we
fought
you
to
a
finish
because
it
in
our
blood
we
whipped
you
because
we
were
compelled
to
in
order
to
preserve
the
union
but
we
share
our
last
cent
or
last
crust
with
any
now
i
know
i
feel
as
if
every
paroled
confederate
were
a
brother
in
i
know
caton
i
said
and
the
words
came
hard
your
fighting
men
respect
us
even
as
we
do
them
it
has
been
a
sheer
game
of
which
could
stand
the
most
punishment
and
the
weaker
had
to
go
down
i
know
all
that
but
nevertheless
it
is
a
terrible
ending
to
so
much
of
hope
suffering
and
yes
he
admitted
soberly
you
have
given
your
all
but
those
who
survive
have
a
wonderful
work
before
them
they
must
lay
anew
the
foundations
they
are
to
be
the
rebuilders
of
states
you
were
going
home
i
smiled
bitterly
at
this
designation
of
my
journey
end
yes
if
you
can
so
name
a
few
fields
and
a
vacant
negro
cabin
i
certainly
shall
have
to
lay
the
foundation
anew
most
will
you
not
let
me
aid
you
he
questioned
eagerly
i
possess
some
means
and
surely
our
friendship
is
sufficiently
established
to
warrant
me
in
making
the
offer
you
will
not
refuse
i
must
i
answered
firmly
yet
i
do
not
value
the
offer
the
less
sometime
i
may
even
remind
you
of
it
but
now
i
prefer
to
dig
as
the
others
must
i
shall
be
the
stronger
for
it
and
shall
thus
sooner
forget
the
total
for
a
few
moments
we
walked
on
together
in
silence
each
leading
his
horse
i
could
not
but
note
the
contrast
between
us
in
dress
and
bearing
victory
and
defeat
each
had
stamped
its
own
wayne
he
asked
at
length
glancing
furtively
at
me
as
if
to
mark
the
effect
of
his
words
did
you
know
that
brennan
was
again
with
us
the
name
thus
spoken
set
my
heart
to
instant
throbbing
but
i
sought
to
answer
carelessly
whatever
he
may
have
surmised
it
was
plainly
my
duty
to
hide
our
secret
still
i
was
not
even
aware
she
had
been
oh
yes
she
returned
north
immediately
after
your
last
parting
and
came
back
only
last
week
so
many
wives
and
relatives
of
the
officers
have
come
down
of
late
knowing
the
war
to
be
practically
at
an
end
that
our
camp
has
become
like
a
huge
picnic
pavilion
it
is
quite
the
fashionable
fad
just
now
to
visit
the
front
brennan
accompanied
the
wife
of
one
of
the
division
commanders
from
her
state
connecticut
you
there
was
much
i
longed
to
ask
regarding
her
but
i
would
not
venture
to
fan
his
suspicions
in
hope
that
i
might
turn
his
thought
i
asked
and
you
are
you
yet
married
he
laughed
no
that
happy
day
will
not
occur
until
after
we
are
mustered
out
miss
minor
is
far
too
loyal
a
virginian
ever
to
become
my
wife
while
i
continue
to
wear
this
uniform
by
the
way
brennan
was
asking
celia
only
yesterday
if
she
had
heard
anything
of
you
since
the
she
is
at
appomattox
then
no
at
the
headquarters
of
the
sixth
corps
only
a
few
miles
north
from
and
the
major
caton
glanced
at
me
a
peculiar
look
in
his
face
but
answered
simply
naturally
i
have
had
small
intimacy
with
him
after
what
occurred
at
mountain
view
but
he
is
still
retained
upon
general
sheridan
staff
at
brennan
request
we
breakfasted
together
yesterday
morning
but
i
believe
he
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
lines
we
sat
down
upon
a
bank
our
conversation
drifting
back
to
their
uneventful
ride
northward
and
later
to
our
experiences
during
those
last
weeks
of
war
i
have
often
reflected
since
on
the
vivid
contrast
we
must
have
made
while
resting
there
each
holding
the
rein
of
his
horse
our
animals
as
widely
differing
in
appearance
as
ourselves
both
were
typical
of
the
two
services
in
those
last
days
caton
was
attired
in
natty
uniform
fleckless
and
well
groomed
his
linen
immaculate
his
buttons
gleaming
the
rich
yellow
stripes
of
his
arm
of
the
service
making
marked
contrast
with
the
blue
he
wore
and
the
green
he
sat
upon
i
on
the
other
hand
was
haggard
from
hard
sleepless
service
and
insufficient
food
my
shapeless
old
slouch
hat
and
dull
gray
jacket
torn
and
disfigured
the
marks
of
rank
barely
discernible
but
his
manly
hopeful
spirit
reawakened
my
courage
and
for
the
time
i
forgot
disaster
while
listening
to
his
story
of
love
and
his
plans
for
the
future
his
one
thought
was
of
celia
and
the
northern
home
so
soon
now
to
be
made
ready
for
her
coming
the
sun
sank
lower
into
the
western
sky
causing
caton
to
draw
down
his
fatigue
cap
until
its
glazed
visor
almost
completely
hid
his
eyes
with
buoyant
enthusiasm
he
talked
on
each
word
drawing
me
closer
to
him
in
bonds
of
friendship
but
the
time
of
parting
came
and
after
we
had
promised
to
correspond
with
each
other
i
stood
and
watched
while
he
rode
rapidly
back
down
the
road
we
had
traversed
together
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
he
turned
and
waved
his
cap
then
disappeared
leaving
me
alone
with
edith
face
more
clearly
than
ever
a
torture
to
my
memory
of
defeat
her
face
fair
smiling
alluring
yet
the
face
of
another
man
wife
chapter
xxxix
my
lady
of
the
north
i
walked
the
next
mile
thoughtfully
pondering
over
those
vague
hopes
and
plans
with
which
caton
optimism
had
inspired
me
then
the
inevitable
reaction
came
the
one
thing
upon
which
he
built
so
happily
had
been
denied
me
the
woman
i
loved
was
the
wife
of
another
i
might
not
even
dream
of
her
in
my
loneliness
and
poverty
the
remembrance
of
her
could
be
no
incentive
to
labor
and
the
chance
words
kindly
as
they
were
spoken
only
opened
wider
the
yawning
social
chasm
between
us
the
greatest
mercy
would
be
for
us
never
again
to
meet
i
bent
my
head
to
keep
the
westering
sun
from
my
eyes
and
breathing
the
thick
red
dust
i
trudged
steadily
forward
suddenly
there
sounded
behind
me
the
thud
of
hoofs
while
i
heard
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
accompanied
by
gay
exchange
of
words
i
drew
aside
leading
my
horse
into
a
small
thicket
beside
the
road
to
permit
the
cavalcade
to
pass
it
was
a
group
of
perhaps
a
dozen
three
or
four
federal
officers
the
remainder
ladies
whose
bright
dresses
and
smiling
faces
made
a
most
winsome
sight
they
glanced
curiously
aside
at
me
as
they
galloped
past
but
none
paused
and
i
merely
glanced
at
them
with
vague
interest
my
thoughts
elsewhere
suddenly
a
horse
seemed
to
draw
back
from
out
the
centre
of
the
fast
disappearing
party
ah
but
really
you
know
we
can
not
spare
you
a
man
voice
protested
but
you
must
no
colonel
this
chances
to
be
a
case
where
i
prefer
being
alone
was
the
quiet
reply
do
not
wait
please
i
will
either
rejoin
you
shortly
or
ride
directly
to
the
i
had
led
my
limping
horse
out
into
the
road
once
more
to
resume
my
journey
paying
scarcely
the
slightest
attention
to
what
was
taking
place
for
my
head
was
again
throbbing
to
the
hot
pulse
of
the
sun
the
party
of
strangers
rode
slowly
away
into
the
enveloping
dust
cloud
and
i
had
forgotten
them
when
a
low
sweet
voice
spoke
close
beside
me
captain
wayne
i
know
you
can
not
have
forgotten
she
was
leaning
down
from
the
saddle
and
as
i
glanced
eagerly
up
into
her
dear
eyes
they
were
swimming
with
tears
forgotten
never
for
one
moment
i
exclaimed
yet
i
failed
to
perceive
your
presence
until
you
you
appeared
deeply
buried
in
thought
as
we
rode
by
but
i
could
not
leave
you
without
a
word
when
i
knew
you
must
feel
so
bad
i
have
thought
of
you
so
often
and
am
more
glad
than
i
can
tell
to
know
you
have
survived
the
terrible
fighting
of
these
last
few
weeks
but
you
look
so
worn
and
i
am
wearied
yes
i
admitted
but
that
will
pass
away
my
meeting
again
with
you
will
be
a
memory
of
good
cheer
and
i
found
no
little
encouragement
from
a
conversation
just
held
with
lieutenant
she
looked
at
me
frankly
her
eyes
cleared
of
the
mist
were
you
indeed
thinking
hopefully
just
now
you
appeared
so
grave
i
feared
it
was
it
was
a
mixture
of
both
brennan
my
own
known
condition
furnishes
sufficient
despair
while
caton
excessive
happiness
yields
a
goodly
measure
of
joy
which
i
have
not
yet
entirely
lost
nothing
glorifies
life
even
in
its
darkest
hour
as
the
success
of
she
glanced
at
my
face
shyly
undoubtedly
the
lieutenant
is
in
the
seventh
heaven
at
present
she
admitted
slowly
his
celia
has
led
him
a
merry
chase
these
many
months
before
she
made
full
surrender
but
that
merely
makes
final
victory
the
she
retains
the
disposition
of
a
but
the
heart
of
a
woman
is
back
of
all
her
playfulness
you
are
upon
your
way
home
i
have
just
been
paroled
brennan
after
four
years
of
war
i
am
at
last
free
and
have
turned
my
face
toward
all
that
is
left
of
my
childhood
home
a
few
acres
i
scarcely
know
whether
i
am
luckier
than
the
men
who
i
saw
the
tears
glistening
again
in
her
earnest
eyes
oh
but
you
are
captain
wayne
she
exclaimed
quickly
you
have
youth
and
love
to
inspire
you
for
your
mother
yet
lives
truly
it
makes
my
heart
throb
to
think
of
the
upbuilding
which
awaits
you
men
of
the
south
it
is
through
such
as
you
soldiers
trained
by
stern
duty
that
these
desolated
states
are
destined
to
rise
above
the
ashes
of
war
into
a
greatness
never
before
equalled
i
feel
that
now
in
this
supreme
hour
of
sacrifice
the
men
and
women
of
the
south
are
to
exhibit
before
the
world
a
courage
greater
than
that
of
the
battlefield
it
is
to
be
the
marvel
of
the
nation
and
the
thought
and
pride
of
it
should
make
you
it
may
indeed
be
so
i
can
but
believe
it
as
the
prophecy
comes
from
your
lips
i
might
even
find
courage
to
do
my
part
in
this
redemption
were
you
ever
at
hand
to
she
laughed
gently
i
am
not
a
virginian
captain
wayne
but
a
most
loyal
daughter
of
the
north
yet
if
i
so
inspire
you
by
my
mere
words
surely
it
is
not
so
far
to
my
home
but
you
might
journey
there
to
listen
to
my
further
words
of
i
have
not
forgotten
the
permission
already
granted
me
and
it
is
a
temptation
not
easily
cast
aside
you
return
north
soon
within
a
i
hardly
know
what
prompted
me
to
voice
my
next
question
fate
perhaps
weary
of
being
so
long
mocked
for
i
felt
small
interest
in
her
probable
answer
do
you
expect
your
husband
release
from
duty
by
that
time
she
gave
a
quick
start
of
surprise
drawing
in
her
breath
as
though
suddenly
choked
then
the
rich
color
overspread
her
face
my
husband
she
ejaculated
in
voice
barely
audible
my
husband
surely
you
can
not
mean
major
brennan
but
i
certainly
do
i
said
wondering
what
might
be
wrong
whom
else
could
i
mean
and
you
thought
that
she
asked
incredulously
why
how
could
you
how
should
i
have
thought
otherwise
i
exclaimed
my
eyes
eagerly
searching
her
downcast
face
why
caton
told
me
it
was
so
the
night
i
was
before
sheridan
he
confirmed
it
again
in
conversation
less
than
an
hour
ago
colgate
my
lieutenant
who
met
you
in
a
baltimore
hospital
referred
to
him
the
same
way
if
i
have
been
deceived
through
all
these
months
surely
everything
and
everybody
conspired
to
that
end
you
bore
the
same
name
you
told
me
plainly
you
were
married
you
wore
a
you
resided
while
at
camp
in
his
quarters
you
called
each
other
frank
and
edith
from
first
to
last
not
one
word
has
been
spoken
by
any
one
to
cause
me
to
doubt
that
you
were
his
as
i
spoke
these
words
hastily
vehemently
the
flood
of
color
receded
from
her
face
leaving
it
pale
as
marble
her
lips
parted
but
failed
in
speech
believe
me
brennan
the
mistake
was
a
most
innocent
one
you
are
not
angry
angry
oh
no
but
it
all
seems
so
strange
and
it
hurts
me
a
little
surely
i
have
done
nothing
to
forward
this
unhappy
deceit
for
a
moment
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
as
though
she
would
hide
her
face
from
me
conceal
the
depth
of
her
emotion
then
she
looked
up
once
more
smiling
through
her
tears
i
recall
starting
to
explain
all
this
to
you
once
she
said
striving
vainly
to
appear
at
ease
it
was
when
we
were
interrupted
by
the
sudden
coming
upon
us
of
and
bungay
yet
i
supposed
you
knew
that
you
would
have
learned
the
facts
from
others
the
last
time
we
were
together
i
told
you
i
did
not
wholly
understand
you
it
is
no
wonder
when
you
thought
that
of
me
but
i
understand
now
and
know
you
must
have
despised
no
no
i
protested
warmly
forgetting
all
i
lacked
and
recalling
only
my
deep
love
for
her
it
was
never
that
not
one
word
or
act
between
us
has
ever
lowered
you
an
iota
in
my
esteem
you
have
always
been
my
lady
of
the
north
and
from
the
first
night
of
our
meeting
out
yonder
amid
the
black
mountains
i
have
respected
and
honored
you
as
one
worthy
of
all
sacrifice
all
her
eyes
were
drooping
now
and
hidden
from
me
behind
their
long
dark
lashes
i
am
going
to
tell
you
my
story
captain
wayne
she
said
quietly
it
is
not
a
pleasant
task
under
these
circumstances
yet
one
i
owe
you
as
well
as
myself
this
may
prove
our
last
meeting
and
we
must
not
part
under
the
shadow
of
a
mistake
however
innocently
it
may
have
originated
i
am
the
only
child
of
edwin
adams
a
manufacturer
of
stonington
connecticut
my
father
was
also
for
several
terms
a
member
of
congress
from
that
state
as
the
death
of
my
mother
occurred
when
i
was
but
five
years
old
all
my
father
love
was
lavished
upon
me
and
i
grew
up
surrounded
by
every
advantage
which
abundant
means
and
high
social
position
could
supply
during
all
those
earlier
years
my
playmate
and
most
intimate
companion
was
charles
brennan
a
younger
brother
of
the
major
and
the
son
of
judge
david
brennan
of
the
state
supreme
she
had
been
speaking
slowly
her
eyes
turned
aside
as
though
recalling
carefully
each
fact
before
utterance
now
her
glance
met
mine
and
a
deeper
color
sprang
into
her
clear
cheeks
as
we
grew
older
his
friendship
for
me
ripened
into
love
a
feeling
which
i
found
it
impossible
to
return
i
liked
him
greatly
valued
him
most
highly
continued
his
constant
companion
yet
experienced
no
desire
for
closer
relationship
my
position
was
rendered
the
more
difficult
as
it
had
long
been
the
dream
of
the
heads
of
both
houses
that
our
two
families
with
their
contingent
estates
should
be
thus
united
and
constant
urging
tried
my
decision
severely
nor
would
charles
brennan
give
up
hope
when
he
was
twenty
and
i
barely
seventeen
a
most
serious
accident
occurred
a
runaway
in
which
charles
heroically
preserved
my
life
but
himself
received
injuries
from
which
death
in
a
short
time
was
inevitable
in
those
last
lingering
days
of
suffering
but
one
hope
one
ambition
seemed
to
possess
his
mind
the
desire
to
make
me
his
wife
and
leave
me
the
fortune
which
was
his
through
the
will
of
his
mother
i
can
not
explain
to
you
captain
wayne
the
struggle
i
passed
through
seeking
to
do
what
was
right
and
best
but
finally
moved
by
my
sympathy
eager
to
soothe
his
final
hours
of
suffering
and
urged
by
my
father
i
consented
to
gratify
his
wish
and
we
were
united
in
marriage
while
he
was
on
his
deathbed
two
days
later
he
passed
she
paused
her
voice
faltering
her
eyes
moist
with
unshed
tears
scarce
knowing
it
my
hand
sought
hers
where
it
rested
against
the
saddle
pommel
his
brother
she
resumed
slowly
now
major
brennan
but
at
that
time
a
prosperous
banker
in
hartford
a
man
nearly
double
the
age
of
charles
was
named
as
administrator
of
the
estate
to
retain
its
management
until
i
should
attain
the
age
of
less
than
a
year
later
my
father
also
died
the
final
settlement
of
his
estate
was
likewise
entrusted
to
frank
brennan
and
he
was
made
my
guardian
quite
naturally
i
became
a
resident
of
the
brennan
household
upon
the
same
standing
as
a
daughter
being
legally
a
ward
of
my
husband
brother
major
brennan
age
and
his
thoughtful
kindness
to
me
won
my
respect
and
i
gradually
came
to
look
upon
him
almost
as
an
elder
brother
turning
to
him
in
every
time
of
trouble
for
encouragement
and
help
it
was
the
necessity
of
our
business
relation
which
first
compelled
me
to
come
south
and
join
major
brennan
in
camp
as
he
was
unable
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
i
was
obliged
to
make
the
trip
not
until
that
time
captain
wayne
indeed
not
until
after
our
experience
at
mountain
view
did
i
fully
realize
that
major
brennan
looked
upon
me
otherwise
than
as
a
guardian
upon
his
ward
the
awakening
pained
me
greatly
especially
as
i
was
obliged
to
disappoint
him
deeply
yet
i
seek
to
retain
his
friendship
for
my
memory
of
his
long
kindness
must
ever
abide
i
am
sure
you
will
understand
and
not
consider
me
unwomanly
in
thus
making
you
a
i
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
that
you
have
thus
trusted
me
i
said
with
an
earnestness
that
caused
her
to
lower
her
questioning
eyes
it
has
been
a
strange
misunderstanding
between
us
brennan
but
your
words
have
brought
a
new
hope
to
one
disheartened
confederate
she
did
not
answer
and
with
a
rush
there
came
before
me
the
barrier
of
poverty
existing
between
us
i
glanced
from
my
ragged
faded
clothing
to
her
immaculate
attire
and
my
heart
failed
i
must
be
content
with
hope
i
said
at
last
yet
i
am
rich
compared
with
thousands
of
others
infinitely
rich
in
comparison
with
what
i
dreamed
myself
an
hour
i
held
out
my
hand
there
will
come
a
day
when
i
shall
answer
your
invitation
to
the
you
are
on
your
way
home
yes
to
take
a
fresh
hold
upon
life
trusting
that
sometime
in
the
early
future
i
may
feel
worthy
to
come
to
worthy
she
echoed
the
word
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
voice
her
eyes
dark
with
feeling
worthy
captain
wayne
i
sometimes
think
you
the
most
unselfish
man
i
ever
knew
must
the
sacrifices
then
always
be
made
by
you
can
you
not
conceive
it
possible
that
i
also
might
like
to
yield
up
something
is
it
possible
you
deem
me
a
woman
to
whom
money
is
a
god
no
i
said
my
heart
bounding
to
the
scarce
hidden
meaning
of
her
impetuous
words
nor
have
the
sacrifices
always
been
mine
you
were
once
my
she
bent
down
her
very
soul
in
her
eyes
and
rested
one
white
hand
upon
my
shoulder
for
an
instant
we
read
each
other
heart
in
silence
then
shyly
she
said
i
am
still
your
the
end
