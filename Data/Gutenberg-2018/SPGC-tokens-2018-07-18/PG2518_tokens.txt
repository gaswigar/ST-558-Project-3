the
hungry

my
kinsman
and
myself
were
returning
to
calcutta
from
our
puja
trip
when
we
met
the
man
in
a
train
from
his
dress
and
bearing
we
took
him
at
first
for
an
mahomedan
but
we
were
puzzled
as
we
heard
him
talk
he
discoursed
upon
all
subjects
so
confidently
that
you
might
think
the
disposer
of
all
things
consulted
him
at
all
times
in
all
that
he
did
hitherto
we
had
been
perfectly
happy
as
we
did
not
know
that
secret
and
forces
were
at
work
that
the
russians
had
advanced
close
to
us
that
the
english
had
deep
and
secret
policies
that
confusion
among
the
native
chiefs
had
come
to
a
head
but
our
friend
said
with
a
sly
smile
there
happen
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
reported
in
your
newspapers
as
we
had
never
stirred
out
of
our
homes
before
the
demeanour
of
the
man
struck
us
dumb
with
wonder
be
the
topic
ever
so
trivial
he
would
quote
science
or
comment
on
the
vedas
or
repeat
quatrains
from
some
persian
poet
and
as
we
had
no
pretence
to
a
knowledge
of
science
or
the
vedas
or
persian
our
admiration
for
him
went
on
increasing
and
my
kinsman
a
theosophist
was
firmly
convinced
that
our
must
have
been
supernaturally
inspired
by
some
strange
magnetism
or
occult
power
by
an
astral
body
or
something
of
that
kind
he
listened
to
the
tritest
saying
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
our
extraordinary
companion
with
devotional
rapture
and
secretly
took
down
notes
of
his
conversation
i
fancy
that
the
extraordinary
man
saw
this
and
was
a
little
pleased
with
it
when
the
train
reached
the
junction
we
assembled
in
the
waiting
room
for
the
connection
it
was
then
and
as
the
train
we
heard
was
likely
to
be
very
late
owing
to
something
wrong
in
the
lines
i
spread
my
bed
on
the
table
and
was
about
to
lie
down
for
a
comfortable
doze
when
the
extraordinary
person
deliberately
set
about
spinning
the
following
yarn
of
course
i
could
get
no
sleep
that
night
when
owing
to
a
disagreement
about
some
questions
of
administrative
policy
i
threw
up
my
post
at
junagarh
and
entered
the
service
of
the
nizam
of
hydria
they
appointed
me
at
once
as
a
strong
young
man
collector
of
cotton
duties
at
barich
barich
is
a
lovely
place
the
susta
chatters
over
stony
ways
and
babbles
on
the
pebbles
tripping
like
a
skilful
dancing
girl
in
through
the
woods
below
the
lonely
hills
a
flight
of
steps
rises
from
the
river
and
above
that
flight
on
the
river
brim
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
there
stands
a
solitary
marble
palace
around
it
there
is
no
habitation
of
man
the
village
and
the
cotton
mart
of
barich
being
far
off
about
years
ago
the
emperor
mahmud
shah
ii
had
built
this
lonely
palace
for
his
pleasure
and
luxury
in
his
days
jets
of
spurted
from
its
fountains
and
on
the
cold
marble
floors
of
its
rooms
young
persian
damsels
would
sit
their
hair
dishevelled
before
bathing
and
splashing
their
soft
naked
feet
in
the
clear
water
of
the
reservoirs
would
sing
to
the
tune
of
the
guitar
the
ghazals
of
their
vineyards
the
fountains
play
no
longer
the
songs
have
ceased
no
longer
do
feet
step
gracefully
on
the
snowy
marble
it
is
but
the
vast
and
solitary
quarters
of
like
us
men
oppressed
with
solitude
and
deprived
of
the
society
of
women
now
karim
khan
the
old
clerk
of
my
office
warned
me
repeatedly
not
to
take
up
my
abode
there
pass
the
day
there
if
you
like
said
he
but
never
stay
the
night
i
passed
it
off
with
a
light
laugh
the
servants
said
that
they
would
work
till
dark
and
go
away
at
night
i
gave
my
ready
assent
the
house
had
such
a
bad
name
that
even
thieves
would
not
venture
near
it
after
dark
at
first
the
solitude
of
the
deserted
palace
weighed
upon
me
like
a
nightmare
i
would
stay
out
and
work
hard
as
long
as
possible
then
return
home
at
night
jaded
and
tired
go
to
bed
and
fall
asleep
before
a
week
had
passed
the
place
began
to
exert
a
weird
fascination
upon
me
it
is
difficult
to
describe
or
to
induce
people
to
believe
but
i
felt
as
if
the
whole
house
was
like
a
living
organism
slowly
and
imperceptibly
digesting
me
by
the
action
of
some
stupefying
gastric
juice
perhaps
the
process
had
begun
as
soon
as
i
set
my
foot
in
the
house
but
i
distinctly
remember
the
day
on
which
i
first
was
conscious
of
it
it
was
the
beginning
of
summer
and
the
market
being
dull
i
had
no
work
to
do
a
little
before
sunset
i
was
sitting
in
an
near
the
water
edge
below
the
steps
the
susta
had
shrunk
and
sunk
low
a
broad
patch
of
sand
on
the
other
side
glowed
with
the
hues
of
evening
on
this
side
the
pebbles
at
the
bottom
of
the
clear
shallow
waters
were
glistening
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
anywhere
and
the
still
air
was
laden
with
an
oppressive
scent
from
the
spicy
shrubs
growing
on
the
hills
close
by
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
a
long
dark
curtain
fell
upon
the
stage
of
day
and
the
intervening
hills
cut
short
the
time
in
which
light
and
shade
mingle
at
sunset
i
thought
of
going
out
for
a
ride
and
was
about
to
get
up
when
i
heard
a
footfall
on
the
steps
behind
i
looked
back
but
there
was
no
one
as
i
sat
down
again
thinking
it
to
be
an
illusion
i
heard
many
footfalls
as
if
a
large
number
of
persons
were
rushing
down
the
steps
a
strange
thrill
of
delight
slightly
tinged
with
fear
passed
through
my
frame
and
though
there
was
not
a
figure
before
my
eyes
methought
i
saw
a
bevy
of
joyous
maidens
coming
down
the
steps
to
bathe
in
the
susta
in
that
summer
evening
not
a
sound
was
in
the
valley
in
the
river
or
in
the
palace
to
break
the
silence
but
i
distinctly
heard
the
gay
and
mirthful
laugh
like
the
gurgle
of
a
spring
gushing
forth
in
a
hundred
cascades
as
they
ran
past
me
in
quick
playful
pursuit
of
each
other
towards
the
river
without
noticing
me
at
all
as
they
were
invisible
to
me
so
i
was
as
it
were
invisible
to
them
the
river
was
perfectly
calm
but
i
felt
that
its
still
shallow
and
clear
waters
were
stirred
suddenly
by
the
splash
of
many
an
arm
jingling
with
bracelets
that
the
girls
laughed
and
dashed
and
spattered
water
at
one
another
that
the
feet
of
the
fair
swimmers
tossed
the
tiny
waves
up
in
showers
of
pearl
i
felt
a
thrill
at
my
heart
i
can
not
say
whether
the
excitement
was
due
to
fear
or
delight
or
curiosity
i
had
a
strong
desire
to
see
them
more
clearly
but
naught
was
visible
before
me
i
thought
i
could
catch
all
that
they
said
if
i
only
strained
my
ears
but
however
hard
i
strained
them
i
heard
nothing
but
the
chirping
of
the
cicadas
in
the
woods
it
seemed
as
if
a
dark
curtain
of
years
was
hanging
before
me
and
i
would
fain
lift
a
corner
of
it
tremblingly
and
peer
through
though
the
assembly
on
the
other
side
was
completely
enveloped
in
darkness
the
oppressive
closeness
of
the
evening
was
broken
by
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
and
the
still
surface
of
the
suista
rippled
and
curled
like
the
hair
of
a
nymph
and
from
the
woods
wrapt
in
the
evening
gloom
there
came
forth
a
simultaneous
murmur
as
though
they
were
awakening
from
a
black
dream
call
it
reality
or
dream
the
momentary
glimpse
of
that
invisible
mirage
reflected
from
a
world
years
old
vanished
in
a
flash
the
mystic
forms
that
brushed
past
me
with
their
quick
unbodied
steps
and
loud
voiceless
laughter
and
threw
themselves
into
the
river
did
not
go
back
wringing
their
dripping
robes
as
they
went
like
fragrance
wafted
away
by
the
wind
they
were
dispersed
by
a
single
breath
of
the
spring
then
i
was
filled
with
a
lively
fear
that
it
was
the
muse
that
had
taken
advantage
of
my
solitude
and
possessed
me
the
witch
had
evidently
come
to
ruin
a
poor
devil
like
myself
making
a
living
by
collecting
cotton
duties
i
decided
to
have
a
good
dinner
it
is
the
empty
stomach
that
all
sorts
of
incurable
diseases
find
an
easy
prey
i
sent
for
my
cook
and
gave
orders
for
a
rich
sumptuous
moghlai
dinner
redolent
of
spices
and
ghi
next
morning
the
whole
affair
appeared
a
queer
fantasy
with
a
light
heart
i
put
on
a
sola
hat
like
the
sahebs
and
drove
out
to
my
work
i
was
to
have
written
my
quarterly
report
that
day
and
expected
to
return
late
but
before
it
was
dark
i
was
strangely
drawn
to
my
house
by
what
i
could
not
say
i
felt
they
were
all
waiting
and
that
i
should
delay
no
longer
leaving
my
report
unfinished
i
rose
put
on
my
sola
hat
and
startling
the
dark
shady
desolate
path
with
the
rattle
of
my
carriage
i
reached
the
vast
silent
palace
standing
on
the
gloomy
skirts
of
the
hills
on
the
first
floor
the
stairs
led
to
a
very
spacious
hall
its
roof
stretching
wide
over
ornamental
arches
resting
on
three
rows
of
massive
pillars
and
groaning
day
and
night
under
the
weight
of
its
own
intense
solitude
the
day
had
just
closed
and
the
lamps
had
not
yet
been
lighted
as
i
pushed
the
door
open
a
great
bustle
seemed
to
follow
within
as
if
a
throng
of
people
had
broken
up
in
confusion
and
rushed
out
through
the
doors
and
windows
and
corridors
and
verandas
and
rooms
to
make
its
hurried
escape
as
i
saw
no
one
i
stood
bewildered
my
hair
on
end
in
a
kind
of
ecstatic
delight
and
a
faint
scent
of
attar
and
unguents
almost
effected
by
age
lingered
in
my
nostrils
standing
in
the
darkness
of
that
vast
desolate
hall
between
the
rows
of
those
ancient
pillars
i
could
hear
the
gurgle
of
fountains
plashing
on
the
marble
floor
a
strange
tune
on
the
guitar
the
jingle
of
ornaments
and
the
tinkle
of
anklets
the
clang
of
bells
tolling
the
hours
the
distant
note
of
nahabat
the
din
of
the
crystal
pendants
of
chandeliers
shaken
by
the
breeze
the
song
of
bulbuls
from
the
cages
in
the
corridors
the
cackle
of
storks
in
the
gardens
all
creating
round
me
a
strange
unearthly
music
then
i
came
under
such
a
spell
that
this
intangible
inaccessible
unearthly
vision
appeared
to
be
the
only
reality
in
the
world
and
all
else
a
mere
dream
that
i
that
is
to
say
srijut
the
eldest
son
of
of
blessed
memory
should
be
drawing
a
monthly
salary
of
rs
by
the
discharge
of
my
duties
as
collector
of
cotton
duties
and
driving
in
my
to
my
office
every
day
in
a
short
coat
and
soia
hat
appeared
to
me
to
be
such
an
astonishingly
ludicrous
illusion
that
i
burst
into
a
as
i
stood
in
the
gloom
of
that
vast
silent
hall
at
that
moment
my
servant
entered
with
a
lighted
kerosene
lamp
in
his
hand
i
do
not
know
whether
he
thought
me
mad
but
it
came
back
to
me
at
once
that
i
was
in
very
deed
srijut
son
of
of
blessed
memory
and
that
while
our
poets
great
and
small
alone
could
say
whether
inside
of
or
outside
the
earth
there
was
a
region
where
unseen
fountains
perpetually
played
and
fairy
guitars
struck
by
invisible
fingers
sent
forth
an
eternal
harmony
this
at
any
rate
was
certain
that
i
collected
duties
at
the
cotton
market
at
banch
and
earned
thereby
rs
per
mensem
as
my
salary
i
laughed
in
great
glee
at
my
curious
illusion
as
i
sat
over
the
newspaper
at
my
lighted
by
the
kerosene
lamp
after
i
had
finished
my
paper
and
eaten
my
moghlai
dinner
i
put
out
the
lamp
and
lay
down
on
my
bed
in
a
small
through
the
open
window
a
radiant
star
high
above
the
avalli
hills
skirted
by
the
darkness
of
their
woods
was
gazing
intently
from
millions
and
millions
of
miles
away
in
the
sky
at
collector
lying
on
a
humble
i
wondered
and
felt
amused
at
the
idea
and
do
not
knew
when
i
fell
asleep
or
how
long
i
slept
but
i
suddenly
awoke
with
a
start
though
i
heard
no
sound
and
saw
no
intruder
only
the
steady
bright
star
on
the
hilltop
had
set
and
the
dim
light
of
the
new
moon
was
stealthily
entering
the
room
through
the
open
window
as
if
ashamed
of
its
intrusion
i
saw
nobody
but
felt
as
if
some
one
was
gently
pushing
me
as
i
awoke
she
said
not
a
word
but
beckoned
me
with
her
five
fingers
bedecked
with
rings
to
follow
her
cautiously
i
got
up
noiselessly
and
though
not
a
soul
save
myself
was
there
in
the
countless
apartments
of
that
deserted
palace
with
its
slumbering
sounds
and
waiting
echoes
i
feared
at
every
step
lest
any
one
should
wake
up
most
of
the
rooms
of
the
palace
were
always
kept
closed
and
i
had
never
entered
them
i
followed
breathless
and
with
silent
steps
my
invisible
guide
i
can
not
now
say
where
what
endless
dark
and
narrow
passages
what
long
corridors
what
silent
and
solemn
and
close
secret
cells
i
crossed
though
i
could
not
see
my
fair
guide
her
form
was
not
invisible
to
my
mind
eye
an
arab
girl
her
arms
hard
and
smooth
as
marble
visible
through
her
loose
sleeves
a
thin
veil
falling
on
her
face
from
the
fringe
of
her
cap
and
a
curved
dagger
at
her
waist
methought
that
one
of
the
thousand
and
one
arabian
nights
had
been
wafted
to
me
from
the
world
of
romance
and
that
at
the
dead
of
night
i
was
wending
my
way
through
the
dark
narrow
alleys
of
slumbering
bagdad
to
a
fraught
with
peril
at
last
my
fair
guide
stopped
abruptly
before
a
deep
blue
screen
and
seemed
to
point
to
something
below
there
was
nothing
there
but
a
sudden
dread
froze
the
blood
in
my
i
saw
there
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
screen
a
terrible
negro
eunuch
dressed
in
rich
brocade
sitting
and
dozing
with
outstretched
legs
with
a
naked
sword
on
his
lap
my
fair
guide
lightly
tripped
over
his
legs
and
held
up
a
fringe
of
the
screen
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
part
of
the
room
spread
with
a
persian
carpet
some
one
was
sitting
inside
on
a
bed
i
could
not
see
her
but
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
two
exquisite
feet
in
slippers
hanging
out
from
loose
paijamas
and
placed
idly
on
the
velvet
carpet
on
one
side
there
was
a
bluish
crystal
tray
on
which
a
few
apples
pears
oranges
and
bunches
of
grapes
in
plenty
two
small
cups
and
a
decanter
were
evidently
waiting
the
guest
a
fragrant
intoxicating
vapour
issuing
from
a
strange
sort
of
incense
that
burned
within
almost
overpowered
my
senses
as
with
trembling
heart
i
made
an
attempt
to
step
across
the
outstretched
legs
of
the
eunuch
he
woke
up
suddenly
with
a
start
and
the
sword
fell
from
his
lap
with
a
sharp
clang
on
the
marble
floor
a
terrific
scream
made
me
jump
and
i
saw
i
was
sitting
on
that
of
mine
sweating
heavily
and
the
crescent
moon
looked
pale
in
the
morning
light
like
a
weary
sleepless
patient
at
dawn
and
our
crazy
meher
ali
was
crying
out
as
is
his
daily
custom
stand
back
stand
back
while
he
went
along
the
lonely
road
such
was
the
abrupt
close
of
one
of
my
arabian
nights
but
there
were
yet
a
thousand
nights
left
then
followed
a
great
discord
between
my
days
and
nights
during
the
day
i
would
go
to
my
work
worn
and
tired
cursing
the
bewitching
night
and
her
empty
dreams
but
as
night
came
my
daily
life
with
its
bonds
and
shackles
of
work
would
appear
a
petty
false
ludicrous
vanity
after
nightfall
i
was
caught
and
overwhelmed
in
the
snare
of
a
strange
intoxication
i
would
then
be
transformed
into
some
unknown
personage
of
a
bygone
age
playing
my
part
in
unwritten
history
and
my
short
english
coat
and
tight
breeches
did
not
suit
me
in
the
least
with
a
red
velvet
cap
on
my
head
loose
paijamas
an
embroidered
vest
a
long
flowing
silk
gown
and
coloured
handkerchiefs
scented
with
attar
i
would
complete
my
elaborate
toilet
sit
on
a
chair
and
replace
my
cigarette
with
a
narghileh
filled
with
as
if
in
eager
expectation
of
a
strange
meeting
with
the
beloved
one
i
have
no
power
to
describe
the
marvellous
incidents
that
unfolded
themselves
as
the
gloom
of
the
night
deepened
i
felt
as
if
in
the
curious
apartments
of
that
vast
edifice
the
fragments
of
a
beautiful
story
which
i
could
follow
for
some
distance
but
of
which
i
could
never
see
the
end
flew
about
in
a
sudden
gust
of
the
vernal
breeze
and
all
the
same
i
would
wander
from
room
to
room
in
pursuit
of
them
the
whole
night
long
amid
the
eddy
of
these
amid
the
smell
of
henna
and
the
twanging
of
the
guitar
amid
the
waves
of
air
charged
with
fragrant
spray
i
would
catch
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
momentary
glimpse
of
a
fair
damsel
she
it
was
who
had
paijamas
white
ruddy
soft
feet
in
slippers
with
curved
toes
a
bodice
wrought
with
gold
a
red
cap
from
which
a
golden
frill
fell
on
her
snowy
brow
and
cheeks
she
had
maddened
me
in
pursuit
of
her
i
wandered
from
room
to
room
from
path
to
path
among
the
bewildering
maze
of
alleys
in
the
enchanted
dreamland
of
the
nether
world
of
sleep
sometimes
in
the
evening
while
arraying
myself
carefully
as
a
prince
of
the
before
a
large
mirror
with
a
candle
burning
on
either
side
i
would
see
a
sudden
reflection
of
the
persian
beauty
by
the
side
of
my
own
a
swift
turn
of
her
neck
a
quick
eager
glance
of
intense
passion
and
pain
glowing
in
her
large
dark
eyes
just
a
suspicion
of
speech
on
her
dainty
red
lips
her
figure
fair
and
slim
crowned
with
youth
like
a
blossoming
creeper
quickly
uplifted
in
her
graceful
tilting
gait
a
dazzling
flash
of
pain
and
craving
and
ecstasy
a
smile
and
a
glance
and
a
blaze
of
jewels
and
silk
and
she
melted
away
a
wild
glist
of
wind
laden
with
all
the
fragrance
of
hills
and
woods
would
put
out
my
light
and
i
would
fling
aside
my
dress
and
lie
down
on
my
bed
my
eyes
closed
and
my
body
thrilling
with
delight
and
there
around
me
in
the
breeze
amid
all
the
perfume
of
the
woods
and
hills
floated
through
the
silent
gloom
many
a
caress
and
many
a
kiss
and
many
a
tender
touch
of
hands
and
gentle
murmurs
in
my
ears
and
fragrant
breaths
on
my
brow
or
a
kerchief
was
wafted
again
and
again
on
my
cheeks
then
slowly
a
mysterious
serpent
would
twist
her
stupefying
coils
about
me
and
heaving
a
heavy
sigh
i
would
lapse
into
insensibility
and
then
into
a
profound
slumber
one
evening
i
decided
to
go
out
on
my
horse
i
do
not
know
who
implored
me
to
i
would
listen
to
no
entreaties
that
day
my
english
hat
and
coat
were
resting
on
a
rack
and
i
was
about
to
take
them
down
when
a
sudden
whirlwind
crested
with
the
sands
of
the
susta
and
the
dead
leaves
of
the
avalli
hills
caught
them
up
and
whirled
them
round
and
round
while
a
loud
peal
of
merry
laughter
rose
higher
and
higher
striking
all
the
chords
of
mirth
till
it
died
away
in
the
land
of
sunset
i
could
not
go
out
for
my
ride
and
the
next
day
i
gave
up
my
queer
english
coat
and
hat
for
good
that
day
again
at
dead
of
night
i
heard
the
stifled
sobs
of
some
one
as
if
below
the
bed
below
the
floor
below
the
stony
foundation
of
that
gigantic
palace
from
the
depths
of
a
dark
damp
grave
a
voice
piteously
cried
and
implored
me
oh
rescue
me
break
through
these
doors
of
hard
illusion
deathlike
slumber
and
fruitless
dreams
place
by
your
side
on
the
saddle
press
me
to
your
heart
and
riding
through
hills
and
woods
and
across
the
river
take
me
to
the
warm
radiance
of
your
sunny
rooms
above
who
am
i
oh
how
can
i
rescue
thee
what
drowning
beauty
what
incarnate
passion
shall
i
drag
to
the
shore
from
this
wild
eddy
of
dreams
o
lovely
ethereal
apparition
where
didst
thou
flourish
and
when
by
what
cool
spring
under
the
shade
of
what
wast
thou
born
in
the
lap
of
what
homeless
wanderer
in
the
desert
what
bedouin
snatched
thee
from
thy
mother
arms
an
opening
bud
plucked
from
a
wild
creeper
placed
thee
on
a
horse
swift
as
lightning
crossed
the
burning
sands
and
took
thee
to
the
of
what
royal
city
and
there
what
officer
of
the
badshah
seeing
the
glory
of
thy
bashful
blossoming
youth
paid
for
thee
in
gold
placed
thee
in
a
golden
palanquin
and
offered
thee
as
a
present
for
the
seraglio
of
his
master
and
o
the
history
of
that
place
the
music
of
the
sareng
the
jingle
of
anklets
the
occasional
flash
of
daggers
and
the
glowing
wine
of
shiraz
poison
and
the
piercing
flashing
glance
what
infinite
grandeur
what
endless
servitude
the
to
thy
right
and
left
waved
the
chamar
as
diamonds
flashed
from
their
bracelets
the
badshah
the
king
of
kings
fell
on
his
knees
at
thy
snowy
feet
in
bejewelled
shoes
and
outside
the
terrible
abyssinian
eunuch
looking
like
a
messenger
of
death
but
clothed
like
an
angel
stood
with
a
naked
sword
in
his
hand
then
o
thou
flower
of
the
desert
swept
away
by
the
dazzling
ocean
of
grandeur
with
its
foam
of
jealousy
its
rocks
and
shoals
of
intrigue
on
what
shore
of
cruel
death
wast
thou
cast
or
in
what
other
land
more
splendid
and
more
cruel
suddenly
at
this
moment
that
crazy
meher
ali
screamed
out
stand
back
stand
back
all
is
false
all
is
false
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
that
it
was
already
light
my
chaprasi
came
and
handed
me
my
letters
and
the
cook
waited
with
a
salam
for
my
orders
i
said
no
i
can
stay
here
no
longer
that
very
day
i
packed
up
and
moved
to
my
office
old
karim
khan
smiled
a
little
as
he
saw
me
i
felt
nettled
but
said
nothing
and
fell
to
my
work
as
evening
approached
i
grew
i
felt
as
if
i
had
an
appointment
to
keep
and
the
work
of
examining
the
cotton
accounts
seemed
wholly
useless
even
the
nizamat
of
the
nizam
did
not
appear
to
be
of
much
worth
whatever
belonged
to
the
present
whatever
was
moving
and
acting
and
working
for
bread
seemed
trivial
meaningless
and
contemptible
i
threw
my
pen
down
closed
my
ledgers
got
into
my
and
drove
away
i
noticed
that
it
stopped
of
itself
at
the
gate
of
the
marble
palace
just
at
the
hour
of
twilight
with
quick
steps
i
climbed
the
stairs
and
entered
the
room
a
heavy
silence
was
reigning
within
the
dark
rooms
were
looking
sullen
as
if
they
had
taken
offence
my
heart
was
full
of
contrition
but
there
was
no
one
to
whom
i
could
lay
it
bare
or
of
whom
i
could
ask
forgiveness
i
wandered
about
the
dark
rooms
with
a
vacant
mind
i
wished
i
had
a
guitar
to
which
i
could
sing
to
the
unknown
o
fire
the
poor
moth
that
made
a
vain
effort
to
fly
away
has
come
back
to
thee
forgive
it
but
this
once
burn
its
wings
and
consume
it
in
thy
flame
suddenly
two
fell
from
overhead
on
my
brow
dark
masses
of
clouds
overcast
the
top
of
the
avalli
hills
that
day
the
gloomy
woods
and
the
sooty
waters
of
the
susta
were
waiting
in
terrible
suspense
and
in
an
ominous
calm
suddenly
land
water
and
sky
shivered
and
a
wild
rushed
howling
through
the
distant
pathless
woods
showing
its
like
a
raving
maniac
who
had
broken
his
chains
the
desolate
halls
of
the
palace
banged
their
doors
and
moaned
in
the
bitterness
of
anguish
the
servants
were
all
in
the
office
and
there
was
no
one
to
light
the
lamps
the
night
was
cloudy
and
moonless
in
the
dense
gloom
within
i
could
distinctly
feel
that
a
woman
was
lying
on
her
face
on
the
carpet
below
the
bed
clasping
and
tearing
her
long
dishevelled
hair
with
desperate
fingers
blood
was
tricking
down
her
fair
brow
and
she
was
now
laughing
a
hard
harsh
mirthless
laugh
now
bursting
into
violent
wringing
sobs
now
rending
her
bodice
and
striking
at
her
bare
bosom
as
the
wind
roared
in
through
the
open
window
and
the
rain
poured
in
torrents
and
soaked
her
through
and
through
all
night
there
was
no
cessation
of
the
storm
or
of
the
passionate
cry
i
wandered
from
room
to
room
in
the
dark
with
unavailing
sorrow
whom
could
i
console
when
no
one
was
by
whose
was
this
intense
agony
of
sorrow
whence
arose
this
inconsolable
grief
and
the
mad
man
cried
out
stand
back
stand
back
all
is
false
all
is
false
i
saw
that
the
day
had
dawned
and
meher
ali
was
going
round
and
round
the
palace
with
his
usual
cry
in
that
dreadful
weather
suddenly
it
came
to
me
that
perhaps
he
also
had
once
lived
in
that
house
and
that
though
he
had
gone
mad
he
came
there
every
day
and
went
round
and
round
fascinated
by
the
weird
spell
cast
by
the
marble
demon
despite
the
storm
and
rain
i
ran
to
him
and
asked
ho
meher
ali
what
is
false
the
man
answered
nothing
but
pushing
me
aside
went
round
and
round
with
his
frantic
cry
like
a
bird
flying
fascinated
about
the
jaws
of
a
snake
and
made
a
desperate
effort
to
warn
himself
by
repeating
stand
back
stand
back
all
is
false
all
is
false
i
ran
like
a
mad
man
through
the
pelting
rain
to
my
office
and
asked
karim
khan
tell
me
the
meaning
of
all
this
what
i
gathered
from
that
old
man
was
this
that
at
one
time
countless
unrequited
passions
and
unsatisfied
longings
and
lurid
flames
of
wild
blazing
pleasure
raged
within
that
palace
and
that
the
curse
of
all
the
and
blasted
hopes
had
made
its
every
stone
thirsty
and
hungry
eager
to
swallow
up
like
a
famished
ogress
any
living
man
who
might
chance
to
approach
not
one
of
those
who
lived
there
for
three
consecutive
nights
could
escape
these
cruel
jaws
save
meher
ali
who
had
escaped
at
the
cost
of
his
reason
i
asked
is
there
no
means
whatever
of
my
release
the
old
man
said
there
is
only
one
means
and
that
is
very
difficult
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
but
first
you
must
hear
the
history
of
a
young
persian
girl
who
once
lived
in
that
a
stranger
or
a
more
bitterly
tragedy
was
never
enacted
on
this
earth
just
at
this
moment
the
coolies
announced
that
the
train
was
coming
so
soon
we
hurriedly
packed
up
our
luggage
as
the
tram
steamed
in
an
english
gentleman
apparently
just
aroused
from
slumber
was
looking
out
of
a
carriage
endeavouring
to
read
the
name
of
the
station
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
our
he
cried
hallo
and
took
him
into
his
own
compartment
as
we
got
into
a
carriage
we
had
no
chance
of
finding
out
who
the
man
was
nor
what
was
the
end
of
his
story
i
said
the
man
evidently
took
us
for
fools
and
imposed
upon
us
out
of
fun
the
story
is
pure
fabrication
from
start
to
finish
the
discussion
that
followed
ended
in
a
lifelong
rupture
between
my
theosophist
kinsman
and
myself
the
victory
she
was
the
princess
ajita
and
the
court
poet
of
king
narayan
had
never
seen
her
on
the
day
he
recited
a
new
poem
to
the
king
he
would
raise
his
voice
just
to
that
pitch
which
could
be
heard
by
unseen
hearers
in
the
screened
balcony
high
above
the
hall
he
sent
up
his
song
towards
the
out
of
his
reach
where
circled
with
light
the
planet
who
ruled
his
destiny
shone
unknown
and
out
of
ken
he
would
espy
some
shadow
moving
behind
the
veil
a
tinkling
sound
would
come
to
his
car
from
afar
and
would
set
him
dreaming
of
the
ankles
whose
tiny
golden
bells
sang
at
each
step
ah
the
rosy
red
tender
feet
that
walked
the
dust
of
the
earth
like
god
mercy
on
the
fallen
the
poet
had
placed
them
on
the
altar
of
his
heart
where
he
wove
his
songs
to
the
tune
of
those
golden
bells
doubt
never
arose
in
his
mind
as
to
whose
shadow
it
was
that
moved
behind
the
screen
and
whose
anklets
they
were
that
sang
to
the
time
of
his
beating
heart
manjari
the
maid
of
the
princess
passed
by
the
poet
house
on
her
way
to
the
river
and
she
never
missed
a
day
to
have
a
few
words
with
him
on
the
sly
when
she
found
the
road
deserted
and
the
shadow
of
dusk
on
the
land
she
would
boldly
enter
his
room
and
sit
at
the
corner
of
his
carpet
there
was
a
suspicion
of
an
added
care
in
the
choice
of
the
colour
of
her
veil
in
the
setting
of
the
flower
in
her
hair
people
smiled
and
whispered
at
this
and
they
were
not
to
blame
for
shekhar
the
poet
never
took
the
trouble
to
hide
the
fact
that
these
meetings
were
a
pure
joy
to
him
the
meaning
of
her
name
was
the
spray
of
flowers
one
must
confess
that
for
an
ordinary
mortal
it
was
sufficient
in
its
sweetness
but
shekhar
made
his
own
addition
to
this
name
and
called
her
the
spray
of
spring
flowers
and
ordinary
mortals
shook
their
heads
and
said
ah
me
in
the
spring
songs
that
the
poet
sang
the
praise
of
the
spray
of
spring
flowers
was
conspicuously
reiterated
and
the
king
winked
and
smiled
at
him
when
he
heard
it
and
the
poet
smiled
in
answer
the
king
would
put
him
the
question
is
it
the
business
of
the
bee
merely
to
hum
in
the
court
of
the
spring
the
poet
would
answer
no
but
also
to
sip
the
honey
of
the
spray
of
spring
flowers
and
they
all
laughed
in
the
king
hall
and
it
was
rumoured
that
the
princess
akita
also
laughed
at
her
maid
accepting
the
poet
name
for
her
and
manjari
felt
glad
in
her
heart
thus
truth
and
falsehood
mingle
in
life
and
to
what
god
builds
man
adds
his
own
decoration
only
those
were
pure
truths
which
were
sung
by
the
poet
the
theme
was
krishna
the
lover
god
and
radha
the
beloved
the
eternal
man
and
the
eternal
woman
the
sorrow
that
comes
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
the
joy
without
end
the
truth
of
these
songs
was
tested
in
his
inmost
heart
by
everybody
from
the
beggar
to
the
king
himself
the
poet
songs
were
on
the
lips
of
all
at
the
merest
glimmer
of
the
moon
and
the
faintest
whisper
of
the
summer
breeze
his
songs
would
break
forth
in
the
land
from
windows
and
courtyards
from
from
shadows
of
the
wayside
trees
in
numberless
voices
thus
passed
the
days
happily
the
poet
recited
the
king
listened
the
hearers
applauded
manjari
passed
and
repassed
by
the
poet
room
on
her
way
to
the
river
the
shadow
flitted
behind
the
screened
balcony
and
the
tiny
golden
bells
tinkled
from
afar
just
then
set
forth
from
his
home
in
the
south
a
poet
on
his
path
of
conquest
he
came
to
king
narayan
in
the
kingdom
of
amarapur
he
stood
before
the
throne
and
uttered
a
verse
in
praise
of
the
king
he
had
challenged
all
the
court
poets
on
his
way
and
his
career
of
victory
had
been
unbroken
the
king
received
him
with
honour
and
said
poet
i
offer
you
welcome
pundarik
the
poet
proudly
replied
sire
i
ask
for
war
shekhar
the
court
poet
of
the
king
did
not
know
how
the
battle
of
the
muse
was
to
be
waged
he
had
no
sleep
at
night
the
mighty
figure
of
the
famous
pundarik
his
sharp
nose
curved
like
a
scimitar
and
his
proud
head
tilted
on
one
side
haunted
the
poet
vision
in
the
dark
with
a
trembling
heart
shekhar
entered
the
arena
in
the
morning
the
theatre
was
filled
with
the
crowd
the
poet
greeted
his
rival
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
pundarik
returned
it
with
a
slight
toss
of
his
head
and
turned
his
face
towards
his
circle
of
adoring
followers
with
a
meaning
smile
shekhar
cast
his
glance
towards
the
screened
balcony
high
above
and
saluted
his
lady
in
his
mind
saying
if
i
am
the
winner
at
the
combat
my
lady
thy
victorious
name
shall
be
glorified
the
trumpet
sounded
the
great
crowd
stood
up
shouting
victory
to
the
king
the
king
dressed
in
an
ample
robe
of
white
slowly
came
into
the
hall
like
a
floating
cloud
of
autumn
and
sat
on
his
throne
pundarik
stood
up
and
the
vast
hall
became
still
with
his
head
raised
high
and
chest
expanded
he
began
in
his
thundering
voice
to
recite
the
praise
of
king
narayan
his
words
burst
upon
the
walls
of
the
hall
like
breakers
of
the
sea
and
seemed
to
rattle
against
the
ribs
of
the
listening
crowd
the
skill
with
which
he
gave
varied
meanings
to
the
name
narayan
and
wove
each
letter
of
it
through
the
web
of
his
verses
in
all
mariner
of
combinations
took
away
the
breath
of
his
amazed
hearers
for
some
minutes
after
he
took
his
seat
his
voice
continued
to
vibrate
among
the
numberless
pillars
of
the
king
court
and
in
thousands
of
speechless
hearts
the
learned
professors
who
had
come
from
distant
lands
raised
their
right
hands
and
cried
bravo
the
king
threw
a
glance
on
shekhar
face
and
shekhar
in
answer
raised
for
a
moment
his
eyes
full
of
pain
towards
his
master
and
then
stood
up
like
a
stricken
deer
at
bay
his
face
was
pale
his
bashfulness
was
almost
that
of
a
woman
his
slight
youthful
figure
delicate
in
its
outline
seemed
like
a
tensely
strung
vina
ready
to
break
out
in
music
at
the
least
touch
his
head
was
bent
his
voice
was
low
when
he
began
the
first
few
verses
were
almost
inaudible
then
he
slowly
raised
his
head
and
his
clear
sweet
voice
rose
into
the
sky
like
a
quivering
flame
of
fire
he
began
with
the
ancient
legend
of
the
kingly
line
lost
in
the
haze
of
the
past
and
brought
it
down
through
its
long
course
of
heroism
and
matchless
generosity
to
the
present
age
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
face
and
all
the
vast
and
unexpressed
love
of
the
people
for
the
royal
house
rose
like
incense
in
his
song
and
enwreathed
the
throne
on
all
sides
these
were
his
last
words
when
trembling
he
took
his
seat
my
master
i
may
be
beaten
in
play
of
words
but
not
in
my
love
for
thee
tears
filled
the
eyes
of
the
hearers
and
the
stone
walls
shook
with
cries
of
victory
mocking
this
popular
outburst
of
feeling
with
an
august
shake
of
his
head
and
a
contemptuous
sneer
pundarik
stood
up
and
flung
this
question
to
the
assembly
what
is
there
superior
to
words
in
a
moment
the
hall
lapsed
into
silence
again
then
with
a
marvellous
display
of
learning
he
proved
that
the
word
was
in
the
beginning
that
the
word
was
god
he
piled
up
quotations
from
scriptures
and
built
a
high
altar
for
the
word
to
be
seated
above
all
that
there
is
in
heaven
and
in
earth
he
repeated
that
question
in
his
mighty
voice
what
is
there
superior
to
words
proudly
he
looked
around
him
none
dared
to
accept
his
challenge
and
he
slowly
took
his
seat
like
a
lion
who
had
just
made
a
full
meal
of
its
victim
the
pandits
shouted
bravo
the
king
remained
silent
with
wonder
and
the
poet
shekhar
felt
himself
of
no
account
by
the
side
of
this
stupendous
learning
the
assembly
broke
up
for
that
day
next
day
shekhar
began
his
song
it
was
of
that
day
when
the
pipings
of
love
flute
startled
for
the
first
time
the
hushed
air
of
the
vrinda
forest
the
shepherd
women
did
not
know
who
was
the
player
or
whence
came
the
music
sometimes
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
heart
of
the
south
wind
and
sometimes
from
the
straying
clouds
of
the
hilltops
it
came
with
a
message
of
tryst
from
the
land
of
the
sunrise
and
it
floated
from
the
verge
of
sunset
with
its
sigh
of
sorrow
the
stars
seemed
to
be
the
stops
of
the
instrument
that
flooded
the
dreams
of
the
night
with
melody
the
music
seemed
to
burst
all
at
once
from
all
sides
from
fields
and
groves
from
the
shady
lanes
and
lonely
roads
from
the
melting
blue
of
the
sky
from
the
shimmering
green
of
the
grass
they
neither
knew
its
meaning
nor
could
they
find
words
to
give
utterance
to
the
desire
of
their
hearts
tears
filled
their
eyes
and
their
life
seemed
to
long
for
a
death
that
would
be
its
consummation
shekhar
forgot
his
audience
forgot
the
trial
of
his
strength
with
a
rival
he
stood
alone
amid
his
thoughts
that
rustled
and
quivered
round
him
like
leaves
in
a
summer
breeze
and
sang
the
song
of
the
flute
he
had
in
his
mind
the
vision
of
an
image
that
had
taken
its
shape
from
a
shadow
and
the
echo
of
a
faint
tinkling
sound
of
a
distant
footstep
he
took
his
seat
his
hearers
trembled
with
the
sadness
of
an
indefinable
delight
immense
and
vague
and
they
forgot
to
applaud
him
as
this
feeling
died
away
pundarik
stood
up
before
the
throne
and
challenged
his
rival
to
define
who
was
this
lover
and
who
was
the
beloved
he
arrogantly
looked
around
him
he
smiled
at
his
followers
and
then
put
the
question
again
who
is
krishna
the
lover
and
who
is
radha
the
beloved
then
he
began
to
analyse
the
roots
of
those
names
and
various
interpretations
of
their
meanings
he
brought
before
the
bewildered
audience
all
the
intricacies
of
the
different
schools
of
metaphysics
with
consummate
skill
each
letter
of
those
names
he
divided
from
its
fellow
and
then
pursued
them
with
a
relentless
logic
till
they
fell
to
the
dust
in
confusion
to
be
caught
up
again
and
restored
to
a
meaning
never
before
imagined
by
the
subtlest
of
the
pandits
were
in
ecstasy
they
applauded
vociferously
and
the
crowd
followed
them
deluded
into
the
certainty
that
they
had
witnessed
that
day
the
last
shred
of
the
curtains
of
truth
torn
to
pieces
before
their
eyes
by
a
prodigy
of
intellect
the
performance
of
his
tremendous
feat
so
delighted
them
that
they
forgot
to
ask
themselves
if
there
was
any
truth
behind
it
after
all
the
king
mind
was
overwhelmed
with
wonder
the
atmosphere
was
completely
cleared
of
all
illusion
of
music
and
the
vision
of
the
world
around
seemed
to
be
changed
from
its
freshness
of
tender
green
to
the
solidity
of
a
high
road
levelled
and
made
hard
with
crushed
stones
to
the
people
assembled
their
own
poet
appeared
a
mere
boy
in
comparison
with
this
giant
who
walked
with
such
case
knocking
down
difficulties
at
each
step
in
the
world
of
words
and
thoughts
it
became
evident
to
them
for
the
first
time
that
the
poems
shekhar
wrote
were
absurdly
simple
and
it
must
be
a
mere
accident
that
they
did
not
write
them
themselves
they
were
neither
new
nor
difficult
nor
instructive
nor
necessary
the
king
tried
to
goad
his
poet
with
keen
glances
silently
inciting
him
to
make
a
final
effort
but
shekhar
took
no
notice
and
remained
fixed
to
his
seat
the
king
in
anger
came
down
from
his
throne
took
off
his
pearl
chain
and
put
it
on
pundarik
head
everybody
in
the
hall
cheered
from
the
upper
balcony
came
a
slight
sound
of
the
movements
of
rustling
robes
and
hung
with
golden
bells
shekhar
rose
from
his
seat
and
left
the
hall
it
was
a
dark
night
of
waning
moon
the
poet
shekhar
took
down
his
mss
from
his
shelves
and
heaped
them
on
the
floor
some
of
them
contained
his
earliest
writings
which
he
had
almost
forgotten
he
turned
over
the
pages
reading
passages
here
and
there
they
all
seemed
to
him
poor
and
trivial
mere
words
and
childish
rhymes
one
by
one
he
tore
his
books
to
fragments
and
threw
them
into
a
vessel
containing
fire
and
said
to
thee
to
thee
o
my
beauty
my
fire
thou
hast
been
burning
in
my
heart
all
these
futile
years
if
my
life
were
a
piece
of
gold
it
would
come
out
of
its
trial
brighter
but
it
is
a
trodden
turf
of
grass
and
nothing
remains
of
it
but
this
handful
of
ashes
the
night
wore
on
shekhar
opened
wide
his
windows
he
spread
upon
his
bed
the
white
flowers
that
he
loved
the
jasmines
tuberoses
and
chrysanthemums
and
brought
into
his
bedroom
all
the
lamps
he
had
in
his
house
and
lighted
them
then
mixing
with
honey
the
juice
of
some
poisonous
root
he
drank
it
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
golden
anklets
tinkled
in
the
passage
outside
the
door
and
a
subtle
perfume
came
into
the
room
with
the
breeze
the
poet
with
his
eyes
shut
said
my
lady
have
you
taken
pity
upon
your
servant
at
last
and
come
to
see
him
the
answer
came
in
a
sweet
voice
my
poet
i
have
come
shekhar
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
before
his
bed
the
figure
of
a
woman
his
sight
was
dim
and
blurred
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
image
made
of
a
shadow
that
he
had
ever
kept
throned
in
the
secret
shrine
of
his
heart
had
come
into
the
outer
world
in
his
last
moment
to
gaze
upon
his
face
the
woman
said
i
am
the
princess
ajita
the
poet
with
a
great
effort
sat
up
on
his
bed
the
princess
whispered
into
his
car
the
king
has
not
done
you
justice
it
was
you
who
won
at
the
combat
my
poet
and
i
have
come
to
crown
you
with
the
crown
of
victory
she
took
the
garland
of
flowers
from
her
own
neck
and
put
it
on
his
hair
and
the
poet
fell
down
upon
his
bed
stricken
by
death
once
there
was
a
king
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
when
we
were
children
there
was
no
need
to
know
who
the
king
in
the
fairy
story
was
it
did
matter
whether
he
was
called
shiladitya
or
shaliban
whether
he
lived
at
kashi
or
kanauj
the
thing
that
made
a
boy
heart
go
thump
thump
with
delight
was
this
one
sovereign
truth
this
reality
of
all
realities
once
there
was
a
king
but
the
readers
of
this
modern
age
are
far
more
exact
and
exacting
when
they
hear
such
an
opening
to
a
story
they
are
at
once
critical
and
suspicious
they
apply
the
searchlight
of
science
to
its
legendary
haze
and
ask
which
king
the
have
become
more
precise
in
their
turn
they
are
no
longer
content
with
the
old
indefinite
there
was
a
king
but
assume
instead
a
look
of
profound
learning
and
begin
once
there
was
a
king
named
ajatasatru
the
modern
reader
curiosity
however
is
not
so
easily
satisfied
he
blinks
at
the
author
through
his
scientific
spectacles
and
asks
again
which
ajatasatru
every
schoolboy
knows
the
author
proceeds
that
there
were
three
ajatasatrus
the
first
was
born
in
the
twentieth
century
and
died
at
the
tender
age
of
two
years
and
eight
months
i
deeply
regret
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
from
any
trustworthy
source
a
detailed
account
of
his
reign
the
second
ajatasatru
is
better
known
to
historians
if
you
refer
to
the
new
encyclopedia
of
history
by
this
time
the
modern
reader
suspicions
are
dissolved
he
feels
he
may
safely
trust
his
author
he
says
to
himself
now
we
shall
have
a
story
that
is
both
improving
and
instructive
ah
how
we
all
love
to
be
deluded
we
have
a
secret
dread
of
being
thought
ignorant
and
we
end
by
being
ignorant
after
all
only
we
have
done
it
in
a
long
and
roundabout
way
there
is
an
english
proverb
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
will
tell
you
no
lies
the
boy
of
seven
who
is
listening
to
a
fairy
story
understands
that
perfectly
well
he
withholds
his
questions
while
the
story
is
being
told
so
the
pure
and
beautiful
falsehood
of
it
all
remains
naked
and
innocent
as
a
babe
transparent
as
truth
itself
limpid
as
afresh
bubbling
spring
but
the
ponderous
and
learned
lie
of
our
moderns
has
to
keep
its
true
character
draped
and
veiled
and
if
there
is
discovered
anywhere
the
least
little
of
deception
the
reader
turns
away
with
a
prudish
disgust
and
the
author
is
discredited
when
we
were
young
we
understood
all
sweet
things
and
we
could
detect
the
sweets
of
a
fairy
story
by
an
unerring
science
of
our
own
we
never
cared
for
such
useless
things
as
knowledge
we
only
cared
for
truth
and
our
unsophisticated
little
hearts
knew
well
where
the
crystal
palace
of
truth
lay
and
how
to
reach
it
but
we
are
expected
to
write
pages
of
facts
while
the
truth
is
simply
this
there
was
a
king
i
remember
vividly
that
evening
in
calcutta
when
the
fairy
story
began
the
rain
and
the
storm
had
been
incessant
the
whole
of
the
city
was
flooded
the
water
was
in
our
lane
i
had
a
straining
hope
which
was
almost
a
certainty
that
my
tutor
would
be
prevented
from
coming
that
evening
i
sat
on
the
stool
in
the
far
corner
of
the
veranda
looking
down
the
lane
with
a
heart
beating
faster
and
faster
every
minute
i
kept
my
eye
on
the
rain
and
when
it
began
to
grow
less
i
prayed
with
all
my
might
please
god
send
some
more
rain
till
seven
is
over
for
i
was
quite
ready
to
believe
that
there
was
no
other
need
for
rain
except
to
protect
one
helpless
boy
one
evening
in
one
corner
of
calcutta
from
the
deadly
clutches
of
his
tutor
if
not
in
answer
to
my
prayer
at
any
rate
according
to
some
grosser
law
of
physical
nature
the
rain
did
not
give
up
but
alas
nor
did
my
teacher
exactly
to
the
minute
in
the
bend
of
the
lane
i
saw
his
approaching
umbrella
the
great
bubble
of
hope
burst
in
my
breast
and
my
heart
collapsed
truly
if
there
is
a
punishment
to
fit
the
crime
after
death
then
my
tutor
will
be
born
again
as
me
and
i
shall
be
born
as
my
tutor
as
soon
as
i
saw
his
umbrella
i
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
to
my
room
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
were
sitting
opposite
one
another
playing
cards
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
i
ran
into
the
room
and
flung
myself
on
the
bed
beside
my
mother
and
said
mother
dear
the
tutor
has
come
and
i
have
such
a
bad
headache
could
i
have
no
lessons
today
i
hope
no
child
of
immature
age
will
be
allowed
to
read
this
story
and
i
sincerely
trust
it
will
not
be
used
in
or
primers
for
schools
for
what
i
did
was
dreadfully
bad
and
i
received
no
punishment
whatever
on
the
contrary
my
wickedness
was
crowned
with
success
my
mother
said
to
me
all
right
and
turning
to
the
servant
added
tell
the
tutor
that
he
can
go
back
home
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
she
did
think
my
illness
very
serious
as
she
went
on
with
her
game
as
before
and
took
no
further
notice
and
i
also
burying
my
head
in
the
pillow
laughed
to
my
heart
content
we
perfectly
understood
one
another
my
mother
and
i
but
every
one
must
know
how
hard
it
is
for
a
boy
of
seven
years
old
to
keep
up
the
illusion
of
illness
for
a
long
time
after
about
a
minute
i
got
hold
of
grandmother
and
said
grannie
do
tell
me
a
story
i
had
to
ask
this
many
times
grannie
and
mother
went
on
playing
cards
and
took
no
notice
at
last
mother
said
to
me
child
do
bother
wait
till
we
finished
our
game
but
i
persisted
grannie
do
tell
me
a
story
i
told
mother
she
could
finish
her
game
but
she
must
let
grannie
tell
me
a
story
there
and
then
at
last
mother
threw
down
the
cards
and
said
you
had
better
do
what
he
wants
i
ca
manage
him
perhaps
she
had
it
in
her
mind
that
she
would
have
no
tiresome
tutor
on
the
morrow
while
i
should
be
obliged
to
be
back
to
those
stupid
lessons
as
soon
as
ever
mother
had
given
way
i
rushed
at
grannie
i
got
hold
of
her
hand
and
dancing
with
delight
dragged
her
inside
my
mosquito
curtain
on
to
the
bed
i
clutched
hold
of
the
bolster
with
both
hands
in
my
excitement
and
jumped
up
and
down
with
joy
and
when
i
had
got
a
little
quieter
said
now
grannie
let
s
have
the
story
grannie
went
on
and
the
king
had
a
queen
that
was
good
to
begin
with
he
had
only
one
it
is
usual
for
kings
in
fairy
stories
to
be
extravagant
in
queens
and
whenever
we
hear
that
there
are
two
queens
our
hearts
begin
to
sink
one
is
sure
to
be
unhappy
but
in
grannie
story
that
danger
was
past
he
had
only
one
queen
we
next
hear
that
the
king
had
not
got
any
son
at
the
age
of
seven
i
did
think
there
was
any
need
to
bother
if
a
man
had
had
no
son
he
might
only
have
been
in
the
way
nor
are
we
greatly
excited
when
we
hear
that
the
king
has
gone
away
into
the
forest
to
practise
austerities
in
order
to
get
a
son
there
was
only
one
thing
that
would
have
made
me
go
into
the
forest
and
that
was
to
get
away
from
my
tutor
but
the
king
left
behind
with
his
queen
a
small
girl
who
grew
up
into
a
beautiful
princess
twelve
years
pass
away
and
the
king
goes
on
practising
austerities
and
never
thinks
all
this
while
of
his
beautiful
daughter
the
princess
has
reached
the
full
bloom
of
her
youth
the
age
of
marriage
has
passed
but
the
king
does
not
return
and
the
queen
pines
away
with
grief
and
cries
is
my
golden
daughter
destined
to
die
unmarried
ah
me
what
a
fate
is
mine
then
the
queen
sent
men
to
the
king
to
entreat
him
earnestly
to
come
back
for
a
single
night
and
take
one
meal
in
the
palace
and
the
king
consented
the
queen
cooked
with
her
own
hand
and
with
the
greatest
care
dishes
and
made
a
seat
for
him
of
and
arranged
the
food
in
plates
of
gold
and
cups
of
silver
the
princess
stood
behind
with
the
fan
in
her
hand
the
king
after
twelve
absence
came
into
the
house
and
the
princess
waved
the
fan
lighting
up
all
the
room
with
her
beauty
the
king
looked
in
his
daughter
face
and
forgot
to
take
his
food
at
last
he
asked
his
queen
pray
who
is
this
girl
whose
beauty
shines
as
the
gold
image
of
the
goddess
whose
daughter
is
she
the
queen
beat
her
forehead
and
cried
ah
how
evil
is
my
fate
do
you
not
know
your
own
daughter
the
king
was
struck
with
amazement
he
said
at
last
my
tiny
daughter
has
grown
to
be
a
woman
what
else
the
queen
said
with
a
sigh
do
you
not
know
that
twelve
years
have
passed
by
but
why
did
you
not
give
her
in
marriage
asked
the
king
you
were
away
the
queen
said
and
how
could
i
find
her
a
suitable
husband
the
king
became
vehement
with
excitement
the
first
man
i
see
he
said
when
i
come
out
of
the
palace
shall
marry
her
the
princess
went
on
waving
her
fan
of
peacock
feathers
and
the
king
finished
his
meal
the
next
morning
as
the
king
came
out
of
his
palace
he
saw
the
son
of
a
brahman
gathering
sticks
in
the
forest
outside
the
palace
gates
his
age
was
about
seven
or
eight
the
king
said
i
will
marry
my
daughter
to
him
who
can
interfere
with
a
king
command
at
once
the
boy
was
called
and
the
marriage
garlands
were
exchanged
between
him
and
the
princess
at
this
point
i
came
up
close
to
my
wise
grannie
and
asked
her
eagerly
what
then
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
there
was
a
devout
wish
to
substitute
myself
for
that
fortunate
of
seven
years
old
the
night
was
resonant
with
the
patter
of
rain
the
earthen
lamp
by
my
bedside
was
burning
low
my
grandmother
voice
droned
on
as
she
told
the
story
and
all
these
things
served
to
create
in
a
corner
of
my
credulous
heart
the
belief
that
i
had
been
gathering
sticks
in
the
dawn
of
some
indefinite
time
in
the
kingdom
of
some
unknown
king
and
in
a
moment
garlands
had
been
exchanged
between
me
and
the
princess
beautiful
as
the
goddess
of
grace
she
had
a
gold
band
on
her
hair
and
gold
earrings
in
her
ears
she
bad
a
necklace
and
bracelets
of
gold
and
a
golden
round
her
waist
and
a
pair
of
golden
anklets
tinkled
above
her
feet
if
my
grandmother
were
an
author
how
many
explanations
she
would
have
to
offer
for
this
little
story
first
of
all
every
one
would
ask
why
the
king
remained
twelve
years
in
the
forest
secondly
why
should
the
king
daughter
remain
unmarried
all
that
while
this
would
be
regarded
as
absurd
even
if
she
could
have
got
so
far
without
a
quarrel
still
there
would
have
been
a
great
hue
and
cry
about
the
marriage
itself
first
it
never
happened
secondly
how
could
there
be
a
marriage
between
a
princess
of
the
warrior
caste
and
a
boy
of
the
priestly
brahman
caste
her
readers
would
have
imagined
at
once
that
the
writer
was
preaching
against
our
social
customs
in
an
underhand
way
and
they
would
write
letters
to
the
papers
so
i
pray
with
all
my
heart
that
my
grandmother
may
be
born
a
grandmother
again
and
not
through
some
cursed
fate
take
birth
as
her
luckless
grandson
so
with
a
throb
of
joy
and
delight
i
asked
grannie
what
then
grannie
went
on
then
the
princess
took
her
little
husband
away
in
great
distress
and
built
a
large
palace
with
seven
wings
and
began
to
cherish
her
husband
with
great
care
i
jumped
up
and
down
in
my
bed
and
clutched
at
the
bolster
more
tightly
than
ever
and
said
what
then
grannie
continued
the
little
boy
went
to
school
and
learnt
many
lessons
from
his
teachers
and
as
he
grew
up
his
began
to
ask
him
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
who
lives
with
you
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
the
brahman
son
was
eager
to
know
who
she
was
he
could
only
remember
how
one
day
he
had
been
gathering
sticks
and
a
great
disturbance
arose
but
all
that
was
so
long
ago
that
he
had
no
clear
recollection
four
or
five
years
passed
in
this
way
his
companions
always
asked
him
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
the
brahman
son
would
come
back
from
school
and
sadly
tell
the
princess
my
school
companions
always
ask
me
who
is
that
beautiful
lady
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
i
can
give
them
no
reply
tell
me
oh
tell
me
who
you
are
the
princess
said
let
it
pass
i
will
tell
you
some
other
day
and
every
day
the
brahman
son
would
ask
who
are
you
and
the
princess
would
reply
let
it
pass
i
will
tell
you
some
other
day
in
this
manner
four
or
five
more
years
passed
away
at
last
the
brahman
son
became
very
impatient
and
said
if
you
do
not
tell
me
who
you
are
o
beautiful
lady
i
will
leave
this
palace
with
the
seven
wings
then
the
princess
said
i
will
certainly
tell
you
next
day
the
brahman
son
as
soon
as
he
came
home
from
school
said
now
tell
me
who
you
are
the
princess
said
i
will
tell
you
after
supper
when
you
are
in
bed
the
brahman
son
said
very
well
and
he
began
to
count
the
hours
in
expectation
of
the
night
and
the
princess
on
her
side
spread
white
flowers
over
the
golden
bed
and
lighted
a
gold
lamp
with
fragrant
oil
and
adorned
her
hair
and
dressed
herself
in
a
beautiful
robe
of
blue
and
began
to
count
the
hours
in
expectation
of
the
night
that
evening
when
her
husband
the
brahman
son
had
finished
his
meal
too
excited
almost
to
eat
and
had
gone
to
the
golden
bed
in
the
strewn
with
flowers
he
said
to
himself
i
shall
surely
know
who
this
beautiful
lady
is
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
the
princess
took
for
her
the
food
that
was
left
over
by
her
husband
and
slowly
entered
the
she
had
to
answer
that
night
the
question
which
was
the
beautiful
lady
who
lived
in
the
palace
with
the
seven
wings
and
as
she
went
up
to
the
bed
to
tell
him
she
found
a
serpent
had
crept
out
of
the
flowers
and
had
bitten
the
brahman
son
her
was
lying
on
the
bed
of
flowers
with
face
pale
in
death
my
heart
suddenly
ceased
to
throb
and
i
asked
with
choking
voice
what
then
grannie
said
then
but
what
is
the
use
of
going
on
any
further
with
the
story
it
would
only
lead
on
to
what
was
more
and
more
impossible
the
boy
of
seven
did
not
know
that
if
there
were
some
what
then
after
death
no
grandmother
of
a
grandmother
could
tell
us
all
about
it
but
the
child
faith
never
admits
defeat
and
it
would
snatch
at
the
mantle
of
death
itself
to
turn
him
back
it
would
be
outrageous
for
him
to
think
that
such
a
story
of
one
teacherless
evening
could
so
suddenly
come
to
a
stop
therefore
the
grandmother
had
to
call
back
her
story
from
the
chamber
of
the
great
end
but
she
does
it
so
simply
it
is
merely
by
floating
the
dead
body
on
a
banana
stem
on
the
river
and
having
some
incantations
read
by
a
magician
but
in
that
rainy
night
and
in
the
dim
light
of
a
lamp
death
loses
all
its
horror
in
the
mind
of
the
boy
and
seems
nothing
more
than
a
deep
slumber
of
a
single
night
when
the
story
ends
the
tired
eyelids
are
weighed
down
with
sleep
thus
it
is
that
we
send
the
little
body
of
the
child
floating
on
the
back
of
sleep
over
the
still
water
of
time
and
then
in
the
morning
read
a
few
verses
of
incantation
to
restore
him
to
the
world
of
life
and
light
the
phatik
chakravorti
was
ringleader
among
the
boys
of
the
village
a
new
mischief
got
into
his
head
there
was
a
heavy
log
lying
on
the
of
the
river
waiting
to
be
shaped
into
a
mast
for
a
boat
he
decided
that
they
should
all
work
together
to
shift
the
log
by
main
force
from
its
place
and
roll
it
away
the
owner
of
the
log
would
be
angry
and
surprised
and
they
would
all
enjoy
the
fun
every
one
seconded
the
proposal
and
it
was
carried
unanimously
but
just
as
the
fun
was
about
to
begin
makhan
phatik
younger
brother
sauntered
up
and
sat
down
on
the
log
in
front
of
them
all
without
a
word
the
boys
were
puzzled
for
a
moment
he
was
pushed
rather
timidly
by
one
of
the
boys
and
told
to
get
up
but
he
remained
quite
unconcerned
he
appeared
like
a
young
philosopher
meditating
on
the
futility
of
games
phatik
was
furious
makhan
he
cried
if
you
do
get
down
this
minute
i
thrash
you
makhan
only
moved
to
a
more
comfortable
position
now
if
phatik
was
to
keep
his
regal
dignity
before
the
public
it
was
clear
he
ought
to
carry
out
his
threat
but
his
courage
failed
him
at
the
crisis
his
fertile
brain
however
rapidly
seized
upon
a
new
manoeuvre
which
would
discomfit
his
brother
and
afford
his
followers
an
added
amusement
he
gave
the
word
of
command
to
roll
the
log
and
makhan
over
together
makhan
heard
the
order
and
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
stick
on
but
he
overlooked
the
fact
like
those
who
attempt
earthly
fame
in
other
matters
that
there
was
peril
in
it
the
boys
began
to
heave
at
the
log
with
all
their
might
calling
out
one
two
three
go
at
the
word
go
the
log
went
and
with
it
went
makhan
philosophy
glory
and
all
all
the
other
boys
shouted
themselves
hoarse
with
delight
but
phatik
was
a
little
frightened
he
knew
what
was
coming
and
sure
enough
makhan
rose
from
mother
earth
blind
as
fate
and
screaming
like
the
furies
he
rushed
at
phatik
and
scratched
his
face
and
beat
him
and
kicked
him
and
then
went
crying
home
the
first
act
of
the
drama
was
over
phatik
wiped
his
face
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
sunken
barge
on
the
river
bank
and
began
to
chew
a
piece
of
grass
a
boat
came
up
to
the
landing
and
a
man
with
grey
hair
and
dark
moustache
stepped
on
shore
he
saw
the
boy
sitting
there
doing
nothing
and
asked
him
where
the
chakravortis
lived
phatik
went
on
chewing
the
grass
and
said
over
there
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
tell
where
he
pointed
the
stranger
asked
him
again
he
swung
his
legs
to
and
fro
on
the
side
of
the
barge
and
said
go
and
find
out
and
continued
to
chew
the
grass
as
before
but
now
a
servant
came
down
from
the
house
and
told
phatik
his
mother
wanted
him
phatik
refused
to
move
but
the
servant
was
the
master
on
this
occasion
he
took
phatik
up
roughly
and
carried
him
kicking
and
struggling
in
impotent
rage
when
phatik
came
into
the
house
his
mother
saw
him
she
called
out
angrily
so
you
have
been
hitting
makhan
again
phatik
answered
indignantly
no
i
have
who
told
you
that
his
mother
shouted
do
tell
lies
you
have
phatik
said
suddenly
i
tell
you
i
have
you
ask
makhan
but
makhan
thought
it
best
to
stick
to
his
previous
statement
he
said
yes
mother
phatik
did
hit
me
phatik
patience
was
already
exhausted
he
could
not
hear
this
injustice
he
rushed
at
makban
and
hammered
him
with
blows
take
that
he
cried
and
that
and
that
for
telling
lies
his
mother
took
makhan
side
in
a
moment
and
pulled
phatik
away
beating
him
with
her
hands
when
phatik
pushed
her
aside
she
shouted
out
what
i
you
little
villain
would
you
hit
your
own
mother
it
was
just
at
this
critical
juncture
that
the
stranger
arrived
he
asked
what
was
the
matter
phatik
looked
sheepish
and
ashamed
but
when
his
mother
stepped
back
and
looked
at
the
stranger
her
anger
was
changed
to
surprise
for
she
recognised
her
brother
and
cried
why
dada
where
have
you
come
from
as
she
said
these
words
she
bowed
to
the
ground
and
touched
his
feet
her
brother
had
gone
away
soon
after
she
had
married
and
he
had
started
business
in
bombay
his
sister
had
lost
her
husband
while
he
was
in
bombay
bishamber
had
now
come
back
to
calcutta
and
had
at
once
made
enquiries
about
his
sister
he
had
then
hastened
to
see
her
as
soon
as
he
found
out
where
she
was
the
next
few
days
were
full
of
rejoicing
the
brother
asked
after
the
education
of
the
two
boys
he
was
told
by
his
sister
that
phatik
was
a
perpetual
nuisance
he
was
lazy
disobedient
and
wild
but
makhan
was
as
good
as
gold
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
and
very
fond
of
reading
bishamber
kindly
offered
to
take
phatik
off
his
sister
hands
and
educate
him
with
his
own
children
in
calcutta
the
widowed
mother
readily
agreed
when
his
uncle
asked
phatik
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
calcutta
with
him
his
joy
knew
no
bounds
and
he
said
oh
yes
uncle
in
a
way
that
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
meant
it
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
the
mother
to
get
rid
of
phatik
she
had
a
prejudice
against
the
boy
and
no
love
was
lost
between
the
two
brothers
she
was
in
daily
fear
that
he
would
either
drown
makhan
some
day
in
the
river
or
break
his
head
in
a
fight
or
run
him
into
some
danger
or
other
at
the
same
time
she
was
somewhat
distressed
to
see
phatik
extreme
eagerness
to
get
away
phatik
as
soon
as
all
was
settled
kept
asking
his
uncle
every
minute
when
they
were
to
start
he
was
on
pins
and
needles
all
day
long
with
excitement
and
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
he
bequeathed
to
makhan
in
perpetuity
his
his
big
kite
and
his
marbles
indeed
at
this
time
of
departure
his
generosity
towards
makhan
was
unbounded
when
they
reached
calcutta
phatik
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
aunt
for
the
first
time
she
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
this
unnecessary
addition
to
her
family
she
found
her
own
three
boys
quite
enough
to
manage
without
taking
any
one
else
and
to
bring
a
village
lad
of
fourteen
into
their
midst
was
terribly
upsetting
bishamber
should
really
have
thought
twice
before
committing
such
an
indiscretion
in
this
world
of
human
affairs
there
is
no
worse
nuisance
than
a
boy
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
is
neither
ornamental
nor
useful
it
is
impossible
to
shower
affection
on
him
as
on
a
little
boy
and
he
is
always
getting
in
the
way
if
he
talks
with
a
childish
lisp
he
is
called
a
baby
and
if
he
answers
in
a
way
he
is
called
impertinent
in
fact
any
talk
at
all
from
him
is
resented
then
he
is
at
the
unattractive
growing
age
he
grows
out
of
his
clothes
with
indecent
haste
his
voice
grows
hoarse
and
breaks
and
quavers
his
face
grows
suddenly
angular
and
unsightly
it
is
easy
to
excuse
the
shortcomings
of
early
childhood
but
it
is
hard
to
tolerate
even
unavoidable
lapses
in
a
boy
of
fourteen
the
lad
himself
becomes
painfully
when
he
talks
with
elderly
people
he
is
either
unduly
forward
or
else
so
unduly
shy
that
he
appears
ashamed
of
his
very
existence
yet
it
is
at
this
very
age
when
in
his
heart
of
hearts
a
young
lad
most
craves
for
recognition
and
love
and
he
becomes
the
devoted
slave
of
any
one
who
shows
him
consideration
but
none
dare
openly
love
him
for
that
would
be
regarded
as
undue
indulgence
and
therefore
bad
for
the
boy
so
what
with
scolding
and
chiding
he
becomes
very
much
like
a
stray
dog
that
has
lost
his
master
for
a
boy
of
fourteen
his
own
home
is
the
only
paradise
to
live
in
a
strange
house
with
strange
people
is
little
short
of
torture
while
the
height
of
bliss
is
to
receive
the
kind
looks
of
women
and
never
to
be
slighted
by
them
it
was
anguish
to
phatik
to
be
the
unwelcome
guest
in
his
aunt
house
despised
by
this
elderly
woman
and
slighted
on
every
occasion
if
she
ever
asked
him
to
do
anything
for
her
he
would
be
so
overjoyed
that
he
would
overdo
it
and
then
she
would
tell
him
not
to
be
so
stupid
but
to
get
on
with
his
lessons
the
cramped
atmosphere
of
neglect
in
his
aunt
house
oppressed
phatik
so
much
that
he
felt
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
he
wanted
to
go
out
into
the
open
country
and
fill
his
lungs
and
breathe
freely
but
there
was
no
open
country
to
go
to
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
calcutta
houses
and
walls
he
would
dream
night
after
night
of
his
village
home
and
long
to
be
back
there
he
remembered
the
glorious
meadow
where
he
used
to
fly
his
kite
all
day
long
the
broad
where
he
would
wander
about
the
livelong
day
singing
and
shouting
for
joy
the
narrow
brook
where
he
could
go
and
dive
and
swim
at
any
time
he
liked
he
thought
of
his
band
of
boy
companions
over
whom
he
was
despot
and
above
all
the
memory
of
that
tyrant
mother
of
his
who
had
such
a
prejudice
against
him
occupied
him
day
and
night
a
kind
of
physical
love
like
that
of
animals
a
longing
to
be
in
the
presence
of
the
one
who
is
loved
an
inexpressible
wistfulness
during
absence
a
silent
cry
of
the
inmost
heart
for
the
mother
like
the
lowing
of
a
calf
in
the
twilight
love
which
was
almost
an
animal
instinct
agitated
the
shy
nervous
lean
uncouth
and
ugly
boy
no
one
could
understand
it
but
it
preyed
upon
his
mind
continually
there
was
no
more
backward
boy
in
the
whole
school
than
phatik
he
gaped
and
remained
silent
when
the
teacher
asked
him
a
question
and
like
an
overladen
ass
patiently
suffered
all
the
blows
that
came
down
on
his
back
when
other
boys
were
out
at
play
he
stood
wistfully
by
the
window
and
gazed
at
the
roofs
of
the
distant
houses
and
if
by
chance
he
espied
children
playing
on
the
open
terrace
of
any
roof
his
heart
would
ache
with
longing
one
day
he
summoned
up
all
his
courage
and
asked
his
uncle
uncle
when
can
i
go
home
his
uncle
answered
wait
till
the
holidays
come
but
the
holidays
would
not
come
till
november
and
there
was
a
long
time
still
to
wait
one
day
phatik
lost
his
even
with
the
help
of
books
he
had
found
it
very
difficult
indeed
to
prepare
his
lesson
now
it
was
impossible
day
after
day
the
teacher
would
cane
him
unmercifully
his
condition
became
so
abjectly
miserable
that
even
his
cousins
were
ashamed
to
own
him
they
began
to
jeer
and
insult
him
more
than
the
other
boys
he
went
to
his
aunt
at
last
and
told
her
that
he
had
lost
his
book
his
aunt
pursed
her
lips
in
contempt
and
said
you
great
clumsy
country
lout
how
can
i
afford
with
all
my
family
to
buy
you
new
books
five
times
a
month
that
night
on
his
way
back
from
school
phatik
had
a
bad
headache
with
a
fit
of
shivering
he
felt
he
was
going
to
have
an
attack
of
malarial
fever
his
one
great
fear
was
that
he
would
be
a
nuisance
to
his
aunt
the
next
morning
phatik
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
all
searches
in
the
neighbourhood
proved
futile
the
rain
had
been
pouring
in
torrents
all
night
and
those
who
went
out
in
search
of
the
boy
got
drenched
through
to
the
skin
at
last
bisbamber
asked
help
from
the
police
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
police
van
stopped
at
the
door
before
the
house
it
was
still
raining
and
the
streets
were
all
flooded
two
constables
brought
out
phatik
in
their
arms
and
placed
him
before
bishamber
he
was
wet
through
from
head
to
foot
muddy
all
over
his
face
and
eyes
flushed
red
with
fever
and
his
limbs
all
trembling
bishamber
carried
him
in
his
arms
and
took
him
into
the
inner
apartments
when
his
wife
saw
him
she
exclaimed
what
a
heap
of
trouble
this
boy
has
given
us
had
you
better
send
him
home
phatik
heard
her
words
and
sobbed
out
loud
uncle
i
was
just
going
home
but
they
dragged
me
back
again
the
fever
rose
very
high
and
all
that
night
the
boy
was
delirious
bishamber
brought
in
a
doctor
phatik
opened
his
eyes
flushed
with
fever
and
looked
up
to
the
ceiling
and
said
vacantly
uncle
have
the
holidays
come
yet
may
i
go
home
bishamber
wiped
the
tears
from
his
own
eyes
and
took
phatik
lean
and
burning
hands
in
his
own
and
sat
by
him
through
the
night
the
boy
began
again
to
mutter
at
last
his
voice
became
excited
mother
he
cried
do
beat
me
like
that
mother
i
am
telling
the
truth
the
next
day
phatik
became
conscious
for
a
short
time
he
turned
his
eyes
about
the
room
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
come
at
last
with
an
air
of
disappointment
his
head
sank
back
on
the
pillow
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
with
a
deep
sigh
bishamber
knew
his
thoughts
and
bending
down
his
head
whispered
phatik
i
have
sent
for
your
mother
the
day
went
by
the
doctor
said
in
a
troubled
voice
that
the
boy
condition
was
very
critical
phatik
began
to
cry
out
by
the
mark
three
fathoms
by
the
mark
four
fathoms
by
the
he
had
heard
the
sailor
on
the
calling
out
the
mark
on
the
now
he
was
himself
plumbing
an
unfathomable
sea
later
in
the
day
phatik
mother
burst
into
the
room
like
a
whirlwind
and
began
to
toss
from
side
to
side
and
moan
and
cry
in
a
loud
voice
bishamber
tried
to
calm
her
agitation
but
she
flung
herself
on
the
bed
and
cried
phatik
my
darling
my
darling
phatik
stopped
his
restless
movements
for
a
moment
his
hands
ceased
beating
up
and
down
he
said
eh
the
mother
cried
again
phatik
my
darling
my
darling
phatik
very
slowly
turned
his
head
and
without
seeing
anybody
said
mother
the
holidays
have
come
my
lord
the
baby
i
raicharan
was
twelve
years
old
when
he
came
as
a
servant
to
his
house
he
belonged
to
the
same
caste
as
his
master
and
was
given
his
master
little
son
to
nurse
as
time
went
on
the
boy
left
arms
to
go
to
school
from
school
he
went
on
to
college
and
after
college
he
entered
the
judicial
service
always
until
he
married
raicharan
was
his
sole
attendant
but
when
a
mistress
came
into
the
house
raicharan
found
two
masters
instead
of
one
all
his
former
influence
passed
to
the
new
mistress
this
was
compensated
for
by
a
fresh
arrival
anukul
had
a
son
born
to
him
and
raicharan
by
his
unsparing
attentions
soon
got
a
complete
hold
over
the
child
he
used
to
toss
him
up
in
his
arms
call
to
him
in
absurd
baby
language
put
his
face
close
to
the
baby
and
draw
it
away
again
with
a
grin
presently
the
child
was
able
to
crawl
and
cross
the
doorway
when
raicharan
went
to
catch
him
he
would
scream
with
mischievous
laughter
and
make
for
safety
raicharan
was
amazed
at
the
profound
skill
and
exact
judgment
the
baby
showed
when
pursued
he
would
say
to
his
mistress
with
a
look
of
awe
and
mystery
your
son
will
be
a
judge
some
day
new
wonders
came
in
their
turn
when
the
baby
began
to
toddle
that
was
to
raicharan
an
epoch
in
human
history
when
he
called
his
father
and
his
mother
and
raicharan
then
raicharan
ecstasy
knew
no
bounds
he
went
out
to
tell
the
news
to
all
the
world
after
a
while
raicharan
was
asked
to
show
his
ingenuity
in
other
ways
he
had
for
instance
to
play
the
part
of
a
horse
holding
the
reins
between
his
teeth
and
prancing
with
his
feet
he
had
also
to
wrestle
with
his
little
charge
and
if
he
could
not
by
a
wrestler
trick
fall
on
his
back
defeated
at
the
end
a
great
outcry
was
certain
about
this
time
anukul
was
transferred
to
a
district
on
the
banks
of
the
padma
on
his
way
through
calcutta
he
bought
his
son
a
little
he
bought
him
also
a
yellow
satin
waistcoat
a
cap
and
some
gold
bracelets
and
anklets
raicharan
was
wont
to
take
these
out
and
put
them
on
his
little
charge
with
ceremonial
pride
whenever
they
went
for
a
walk
then
came
the
rainy
season
and
day
after
day
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
the
hungry
river
like
an
enormous
serpent
swallowed
down
terraces
villages
cornfields
and
covered
with
its
flood
the
tall
grasses
and
wild
casuarinas
on
the
from
time
to
time
there
was
a
deep
thud
as
the
crumbled
the
unceasing
roar
of
the
rain
current
could
be
beard
from
far
away
masses
of
foam
carried
swiftly
past
proved
to
the
eye
the
swiftness
of
the
stream
one
afternoon
the
rain
cleared
it
was
cloudy
but
cool
and
bright
raicharan
little
despot
did
not
want
to
stay
in
on
such
a
fine
afternoon
his
lordship
climbed
into
the
raicharan
between
the
shafts
dragged
him
slowly
along
till
he
reached
the
on
the
banks
of
the
river
there
was
no
one
in
the
fields
and
no
boat
on
the
stream
across
the
water
on
the
farther
side
the
clouds
were
rifted
in
the
west
the
silent
ceremonial
of
the
setting
sun
was
revealed
in
all
its
glowing
splendour
in
the
midst
of
that
stillness
the
child
all
of
a
sudden
pointed
with
his
finger
in
front
of
him
and
cried
pitty
fow
close
by
on
a
stood
a
large
kadamba
tree
in
full
flower
my
lord
the
baby
looked
at
it
with
greedy
eyes
and
raicharan
knew
his
meaning
only
a
short
time
before
he
had
made
out
of
these
very
flower
balls
a
small
and
the
child
had
been
so
entirely
happy
dragging
it
about
with
a
string
that
for
the
whole
day
raicharan
was
not
made
to
put
on
the
reins
at
all
he
was
promoted
from
a
horse
into
a
groom
but
raicharan
had
no
wish
that
evening
to
go
splashing
through
the
mud
to
reach
the
flowers
so
he
quickly
pointed
his
finger
in
the
opposite
direction
calling
out
oh
look
baby
look
look
at
the
bird
and
with
all
sorts
of
curious
noises
he
pushed
the
rapidly
away
from
the
tree
but
a
child
destined
to
be
a
judge
can
not
be
put
off
so
easily
and
besides
there
was
at
the
time
nothing
to
attract
his
eyes
and
you
can
not
keep
up
for
ever
the
pretence
of
an
imaginary
bird
the
little
master
mind
was
made
up
and
raicharan
was
at
his
end
very
well
baby
he
said
at
last
you
sit
still
in
the
cart
and
i
go
and
get
you
the
pretty
flower
only
mind
you
do
go
near
the
water
as
he
said
this
he
made
his
legs
bare
to
the
knee
and
waded
through
the
oozing
mud
towards
the
tree
the
moment
raicharan
had
gone
his
little
master
went
off
at
racing
speed
to
the
forbidden
water
the
baby
saw
the
river
rushing
by
splashing
and
gurgling
as
it
went
it
seemed
as
though
the
disobedient
wavelets
themselves
were
running
away
from
some
greater
raicharan
with
the
laughter
of
a
thousand
children
at
the
sight
of
their
mischief
the
heart
of
the
human
child
grew
excited
and
restless
he
got
down
stealthily
from
the
and
toddled
off
towards
the
river
on
his
way
he
picked
up
a
small
stick
and
leant
over
the
bank
of
the
stream
pretending
to
fish
the
mischievous
fairies
of
the
river
with
their
mysterious
voices
seemed
inviting
him
into
their
raicharan
had
plucked
a
handful
of
flowers
from
the
tree
and
was
carrying
them
back
in
the
end
of
his
cloth
with
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
but
when
he
reached
the
there
was
no
one
there
he
looked
on
all
sides
and
there
was
no
one
there
he
looked
back
at
the
cart
and
there
was
no
one
there
in
that
first
terrible
moment
his
blood
froze
within
him
before
his
eyes
the
whole
universe
swam
round
like
a
dark
mist
from
the
depth
of
his
broken
heart
he
gave
one
piercing
cry
master
master
little
master
but
no
voice
answered
no
child
laughed
mischievously
back
no
scream
of
baby
delight
welcomed
his
return
only
the
river
ran
on
with
its
splashing
gurgling
noise
as
before
as
though
it
knew
nothing
at
all
and
had
no
time
to
attend
to
such
a
tiny
human
event
as
the
death
of
a
child
as
the
evening
passed
by
raicharan
mistress
became
very
anxious
she
sent
men
out
on
all
sides
to
search
they
went
with
lanterns
in
their
hands
and
reached
at
last
the
banks
of
the
padma
there
they
found
raicharan
rushing
up
and
down
the
fields
like
a
stormy
wind
shouting
the
cry
of
despair
master
master
little
master
when
they
got
raicharan
home
at
last
he
fell
prostrate
at
his
mistress
feet
they
shook
him
and
questioned
him
and
asked
him
repeatedly
where
he
had
left
the
child
but
all
he
could
say
was
that
he
knew
nothing
though
every
one
held
the
opinion
that
the
padma
had
swallowed
the
child
there
was
a
lurking
doubt
left
in
the
mind
for
a
band
of
gipsies
had
been
noticed
outside
the
village
that
afternoon
and
some
suspicion
rested
on
them
the
mother
went
so
far
in
her
wild
grief
as
to
think
it
possible
that
raicharan
himself
had
stolen
the
child
she
called
him
aside
with
piteous
entreaty
and
said
raicharan
give
me
back
my
baby
oh
give
me
back
my
child
take
from
me
any
money
you
ask
but
give
me
back
my
child
raicharan
only
beat
his
forehead
in
reply
his
mistress
ordered
him
out
of
the
house
artukul
tried
to
reason
his
wife
out
of
this
wholly
unjust
suspicion
why
on
earth
he
said
should
he
commit
such
a
crime
as
that
the
mother
only
replied
the
baby
had
gold
ornaments
on
his
body
who
knows
it
was
impossible
to
reason
with
her
after
that
ii
raicharan
went
back
to
his
own
village
up
to
this
time
he
had
had
no
son
and
there
was
no
hope
that
any
child
would
now
be
born
to
him
but
it
came
about
before
the
end
of
a
year
that
his
wife
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
died
all
overwhelming
resentment
at
first
grew
up
in
raicharan
heart
at
the
sight
of
this
new
baby
at
the
back
of
his
mind
was
resentful
suspicion
that
it
had
come
as
a
usurper
in
place
of
the
little
master
he
also
thought
it
would
be
a
grave
offence
to
be
happy
with
a
son
of
his
own
after
what
had
happened
to
his
master
little
child
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
widowed
sister
who
mothered
the
new
baby
it
would
not
have
lived
long
but
a
change
gradually
came
over
raicharan
mind
a
wonderful
thing
happened
this
new
baby
in
turn
began
to
crawl
about
and
cross
the
doorway
with
mischief
in
its
face
it
also
showed
an
amusing
cleverness
in
making
its
escape
to
safety
its
voice
its
sounds
of
laughter
and
tears
its
gestures
were
those
of
the
little
master
on
some
days
when
raicharan
listened
to
its
crying
his
heart
suddenly
began
thumping
wildly
against
his
ribs
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
former
little
master
was
crying
somewhere
in
the
unknown
land
of
death
because
he
had
lost
his
phailna
for
that
was
the
name
raicharan
sister
gave
to
the
new
baby
soon
began
to
talk
it
learnt
to
say
and
with
a
baby
accent
when
raicharan
heard
those
familiar
sounds
the
mystery
suddenly
became
clear
the
little
master
could
not
cast
off
the
spell
of
his
and
therefore
he
had
been
reborn
in
his
own
house
the
arguments
in
favour
of
this
were
to
raicharan
altogether
beyond
dispute
i
the
new
baby
was
born
soon
after
his
little
master
death
ii
his
wife
could
never
have
accumulated
such
merit
as
to
give
birth
to
a
son
in
middle
age
iii
the
new
baby
walked
with
a
toddle
and
called
out
and
there
was
no
sign
lacking
which
marked
out
the
future
judge
then
suddenly
raicharan
remembered
that
terrible
accusation
of
the
mother
ah
he
said
to
himself
with
amazement
the
mother
heart
was
right
she
knew
i
had
stolen
her
child
when
once
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
he
was
filled
with
remorse
for
his
past
neglect
he
now
gave
himself
over
body
and
soul
to
the
new
baby
and
became
its
devoted
attendant
he
began
to
bring
it
up
as
if
it
were
the
son
of
a
rich
man
he
bought
a
a
yellow
satin
waistcoat
and
a
cap
he
melted
down
the
ornaments
of
his
dead
wife
and
made
gold
bangles
and
anklets
he
refused
to
let
the
little
child
play
with
any
one
of
the
neighbourhood
and
became
himself
its
sole
companion
day
and
night
as
the
baby
grew
up
to
boyhood
he
was
so
petted
and
spoilt
and
clad
in
such
finery
that
the
village
children
would
call
him
your
lordship
and
jeer
at
him
and
older
people
regarded
raicharan
as
unaccountably
crazy
about
the
child
at
last
the
time
came
for
the
boy
to
go
to
school
raicharan
sold
his
small
piece
of
land
and
went
to
calcutta
there
he
got
employment
with
great
difficulty
as
a
servant
and
sent
phailna
to
school
he
spared
no
pains
to
give
him
the
best
education
the
best
clothes
the
best
food
meanwhile
he
lived
himself
on
a
mere
handful
of
rice
and
would
say
in
secret
ah
my
little
master
my
dear
little
master
you
loved
me
so
much
that
you
came
back
to
my
house
you
shall
never
suffer
from
any
neglect
of
mine
twelve
years
passed
away
in
this
manner
the
boy
was
able
to
read
and
write
well
he
was
bright
and
healthy
and
he
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
his
personal
appearance
and
was
specially
careful
in
parting
his
hair
he
was
inclined
to
extravagance
and
finery
and
spent
money
freely
he
could
never
quite
look
on
raicharan
as
a
father
because
though
fatherly
in
affection
he
had
the
manner
of
a
servant
a
further
fault
was
this
that
raicharan
kept
secret
from
every
one
that
himself
was
the
father
of
the
child
the
students
of
the
hostel
where
phailna
was
a
boarder
were
greatly
amused
by
raicharan
country
manners
and
i
have
to
confess
that
behind
his
father
back
phailna
joined
in
their
fun
but
in
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
all
the
students
loved
the
innocent
and
old
man
and
phailna
was
very
fond
of
him
also
but
as
i
have
said
before
he
loved
him
with
a
kind
of
condescension
raicharan
grew
older
and
older
and
his
employer
was
continually
finding
fault
with
him
for
his
incompetent
work
he
had
been
starving
himself
for
the
boy
sake
so
he
had
grown
physically
weak
and
no
longer
up
to
his
work
he
would
forget
things
and
his
mind
became
dull
and
stupid
but
his
employer
expected
a
full
servant
work
out
of
him
and
would
not
brook
excuses
the
money
that
raicharan
had
brought
with
him
from
the
sale
of
his
land
was
exhausted
the
boy
was
continually
grumbling
about
his
clothes
and
asking
for
more
money
raicharan
made
up
his
mind
he
gave
up
the
situation
where
he
was
working
as
a
servant
and
left
some
money
with
phailna
and
said
i
have
some
business
to
do
at
home
in
my
village
and
shall
be
back
soon
he
went
off
at
once
to
baraset
where
anukul
was
magistrate
wife
was
still
broken
down
with
grief
she
had
had
no
other
child
one
day
anukul
was
resting
after
a
long
and
weary
day
in
court
his
wife
was
buying
at
an
exorbitant
price
a
herb
from
a
mendicant
quack
which
was
said
to
ensure
the
birth
of
a
child
a
voice
of
greeting
was
heard
in
the
courtyard
anukul
went
out
to
see
who
was
there
it
was
raicharan
anukul
heart
was
softened
when
he
saw
his
old
servant
he
asked
him
many
questions
and
offered
to
take
him
back
into
service
raicharan
smiled
faintly
and
said
in
reply
i
want
to
make
obeisance
to
my
mistress
anukul
went
with
raicharan
into
the
house
where
the
mistress
did
not
receive
him
as
warmly
as
his
old
master
raicharan
took
no
notice
of
this
but
folded
his
hands
and
said
it
was
not
the
padma
that
stole
your
baby
it
was
i
anukul
exclaimed
great
god
eh
what
where
is
he
raicharan
replied
he
is
with
me
i
will
bring
him
the
day
after
it
was
sunday
there
was
no
magistrate
court
sitting
both
husband
and
wife
were
looking
expectantly
along
the
road
waiting
from
early
morning
for
raicharan
appearance
at
ten
he
came
leading
phailna
by
the
hand
anukul
wife
without
a
question
took
the
boy
into
her
lap
and
was
wild
with
excitement
sometimes
laughing
sometimes
weeping
touching
him
kissing
his
hair
and
his
forehead
and
gazing
into
his
face
with
hungry
eager
eyes
the
boy
was
very
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
son
the
heart
of
anukul
brimmed
over
with
a
sudden
rush
of
affection
nevertheless
the
magistrate
in
him
asked
have
you
any
proofs
raicharan
said
how
could
there
be
any
proof
of
such
a
deed
god
alone
knows
that
i
stole
your
boy
and
no
one
else
in
the
world
when
anukul
saw
how
eagerly
his
wife
was
clinging
to
the
boy
he
realised
the
futility
of
asking
for
proofs
it
would
be
wiser
to
believe
and
then
where
could
an
old
man
like
raicharan
get
such
a
boy
from
and
why
should
his
faithful
servant
deceive
him
for
nothing
but
he
added
severely
raicharan
you
must
not
stay
here
where
shall
i
go
master
said
raicharan
in
a
choking
voice
folding
his
hands
i
am
old
who
will
take
in
an
old
man
as
a
servant
the
mistress
said
let
him
stay
my
child
will
be
pleased
i
forgive
him
but
anukul
magisterial
conscience
would
not
allow
him
no
he
said
he
can
not
be
forgiven
for
what
he
has
done
raicharan
bowed
to
the
ground
and
clasped
anukul
feet
master
he
cried
let
me
stay
it
was
not
i
who
did
it
it
was
god
anukul
conscience
was
worse
stricken
than
ever
when
raicharan
tried
to
put
the
blame
on
god
shoulders
no
he
said
i
could
not
allow
it
i
can
not
trust
you
any
more
you
have
done
an
act
of
treachery
raicharan
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
it
was
not
i
who
did
it
who
was
it
then
asked
anukul
raicharan
replied
it
was
my
fate
but
no
educated
man
could
take
this
for
an
excuse
anukul
remained
obdurate
when
phailna
saw
that
he
was
the
wealthy
magistrate
son
and
not
raicharan
he
was
angry
at
first
thinking
that
he
had
been
cheated
all
this
time
of
his
birthright
but
seeing
raicharan
in
distress
he
generously
said
to
his
father
father
forgive
him
even
if
you
let
him
live
with
us
let
him
have
a
small
monthly
pension
after
hearing
this
raicharan
did
not
utter
another
word
he
looked
for
the
last
time
on
the
face
of
his
son
he
made
obeisance
to
his
old
master
and
mistress
then
he
went
out
and
was
mingled
with
the
numberless
people
of
the
world
at
the
end
of
the
month
anukul
sent
him
some
money
to
his
village
but
the
money
came
back
there
was
no
one
there
of
the
name
of
raicharan
the
kingdom
of
cards
i
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
lonely
island
in
a
distant
sea
where
lived
the
kings
and
queens
the
aces
and
the
knaves
in
the
kingdom
of
cards
the
tens
and
nines
with
the
twos
and
threes
and
all
the
other
members
had
long
ago
settled
there
also
but
these
were
not
people
like
the
famous
court
cards
the
ace
the
king
and
the
knave
were
the
three
highest
castes
the
fourth
caste
was
made
up
of
a
mixture
of
the
lower
cards
the
twos
and
threes
were
lowest
of
all
these
inferior
cards
were
never
allowed
to
sit
in
the
same
row
with
the
great
court
cards
wonderful
indeed
were
the
regulations
and
rules
of
that
island
kingdom
the
particular
rank
of
each
individual
had
been
settled
from
time
immemorial
every
one
had
his
own
appointed
work
and
never
did
anything
else
an
unseen
hand
appeared
to
be
directing
them
wherever
they
went
according
to
the
rules
no
one
in
the
kingdom
of
cards
had
any
occasion
to
think
no
one
had
any
need
to
come
to
any
decision
no
one
was
ever
required
to
debate
any
new
subject
the
citizens
all
moved
along
in
a
listless
groove
without
speech
when
they
fell
they
made
no
noise
they
lay
down
on
their
backs
and
gazed
upward
at
the
sky
with
each
prim
feature
firmly
fixed
for
ever
there
was
a
remarkable
stillness
in
the
kingdom
of
cards
satisfaction
and
contentment
were
complete
in
all
their
rounded
wholeness
there
was
never
any
uproar
or
violence
there
was
never
any
excitement
or
enthusiasm
the
great
ocean
crooning
its
lullaby
with
one
unceasing
melody
lapped
the
island
to
sleep
with
a
thousand
soft
touches
of
its
wave
white
hands
the
vast
sky
like
the
outspread
azure
wings
of
the
brooding
nestled
the
island
round
with
its
downy
plume
for
on
the
distant
horizon
a
deep
blue
line
betokened
another
shore
but
no
sound
of
quarrel
or
strife
could
reach
the
island
of
cards
to
break
its
calm
repose
ii
in
that
foreign
land
across
the
sea
there
lived
a
young
prince
whose
mother
was
a
sorrowing
queen
this
queen
had
fallen
from
favour
and
was
living
with
her
only
son
on
the
seashore
the
prince
passed
his
childhood
alone
and
forlorn
sitting
by
his
forlorn
mother
weaving
the
net
of
his
big
desires
he
longed
to
go
in
search
of
the
flying
horse
the
jewel
in
the
cobra
hood
the
rose
of
heaven
the
magic
roads
or
to
find
where
the
princess
beauty
was
sleeping
in
the
ogre
castle
over
the
thirteen
rivers
and
across
the
seven
seas
from
the
son
of
the
merchant
at
school
the
young
prince
learnt
the
stories
of
foreign
kingdoms
from
the
son
of
the
kotwal
he
learnt
the
adventures
of
the
two
genii
of
the
lamp
and
when
the
rain
came
beating
down
and
the
clouds
covered
the
sky
he
would
sit
on
the
threshold
facing
the
sea
and
say
to
his
sorrowing
mother
tell
me
mother
a
story
of
some
very
land
and
his
mother
would
tell
him
an
endless
tale
she
had
heard
in
her
childhood
of
a
wonderful
country
beyond
the
sea
where
dwelt
the
princess
beauty
and
the
heart
of
the
young
prince
would
become
sick
with
longing
as
he
sat
on
the
threshold
looking
out
on
the
ocean
listening
to
his
mother
wonderful
story
while
the
rain
outside
came
beating
down
and
the
grey
clouds
covered
the
sky
one
day
the
son
of
the
merchant
came
to
the
prince
and
said
boldly
comrade
my
studies
are
over
i
am
now
setting
out
on
my
travels
to
seek
my
fortunes
on
the
sea
i
have
come
to
bid
you
the
prince
said
i
will
go
with
you
and
the
son
of
kotwal
said
also
comrades
trusty
and
true
you
will
not
leave
me
behind
i
also
will
be
your
companion
then
the
young
prince
said
to
his
sorrowing
mother
mother
i
am
now
setting
out
on
my
travels
to
seek
my
fortune
when
i
come
back
once
more
i
shall
surely
have
found
some
way
to
remove
all
your
sorrow
so
the
three
companions
set
out
on
their
travels
together
in
the
harbour
were
anchored
the
twelve
ships
of
the
merchant
and
the
three
companions
got
on
board
the
south
wind
was
blowing
and
the
twelve
ships
sailed
away
as
fast
as
the
desires
which
rose
in
the
breast
at
the
conch
shell
island
they
filled
one
ship
with
conchs
at
the
sandal
wood
island
they
filled
a
second
ship
with
and
at
the
coral
island
they
filled
a
third
ship
with
coral
four
years
passed
away
and
they
filled
four
more
ships
one
with
ivory
one
with
musk
one
with
cloves
and
one
with
nutmegs
but
when
these
ships
were
all
loaded
a
terrible
tempest
arose
the
ships
were
all
of
them
sunk
with
their
cloves
and
nutmeg
and
musk
and
ivory
and
coral
and
and
conchs
but
the
ship
with
the
three
companions
struck
on
an
island
reef
buried
them
safe
ashore
and
itself
broke
in
pieces
this
was
the
famous
island
of
cards
where
lived
the
ace
and
king
and
queen
and
knave
with
the
nines
and
tens
and
all
the
other
members
according
to
the
rules
iii
up
till
now
there
had
been
nothing
to
disturb
that
island
stillness
no
new
thing
had
ever
happened
no
discussion
had
ever
been
held
and
then
of
a
sudden
the
three
companions
appeared
thrown
up
by
the
sea
and
the
great
debate
began
there
were
three
main
points
of
dispute
first
to
what
caste
should
these
unclassed
strangers
belong
should
they
rank
with
the
court
cards
or
were
they
merely
people
to
be
ranked
with
the
nines
and
tens
no
precedent
could
be
quoted
to
decide
this
weighty
question
secondly
what
was
their
clan
had
they
the
fairer
hue
and
bright
complexion
of
the
hearts
or
was
theirs
the
darker
complexion
of
the
clubs
over
this
question
there
were
interminable
disputes
the
whole
marriage
system
of
the
island
with
its
intricate
regulations
would
depend
on
its
nice
adjustment
thirdly
what
food
should
they
take
with
whom
should
they
live
and
sleep
and
should
their
heads
be
placed
or
only
in
all
the
kingdom
of
cards
a
series
of
problems
so
vital
and
critical
had
never
been
debated
before
but
the
three
companions
grew
desperately
hungry
they
had
to
get
food
in
some
way
or
other
so
while
this
debate
went
on
with
its
interminable
silence
and
pauses
and
while
the
aces
called
their
own
meeting
and
formed
themselves
into
a
committee
to
find
some
obsolete
dealing
with
the
question
the
three
companions
themselves
were
eating
all
they
could
find
and
drinking
out
of
every
vessel
and
breaking
all
regulations
even
the
twos
and
threes
were
shocked
at
this
outrageous
behaviour
the
threes
said
brother
twos
these
people
are
openly
shameless
and
the
twos
said
brother
threes
they
are
evidently
of
lower
caste
than
ourselves
after
their
meal
was
over
the
three
companions
went
for
a
stroll
in
the
city
when
they
saw
the
ponderous
people
moving
in
their
dismal
processions
with
prim
and
solemn
faces
then
the
prince
turned
to
the
son
of
the
merchant
and
the
son
of
the
kotwal
and
threw
back
his
head
and
gave
one
stupendous
laugh
down
royal
street
and
across
ace
square
and
along
the
knave
embankment
ran
the
quiver
of
this
strange
laughter
the
laughter
that
amazed
at
itself
expired
in
the
vast
vacuum
of
silence
the
son
of
the
kotwal
and
the
son
of
the
merchant
were
chilled
through
to
the
bone
by
the
stillness
around
them
they
turned
to
the
prince
and
said
comrade
let
us
away
let
us
not
stop
for
a
moment
in
this
awful
land
of
ghosts
but
the
prince
said
comrades
these
people
resemble
men
so
i
am
going
to
find
out
by
shaking
them
upside
down
and
outside
in
whether
they
have
a
single
drop
of
warm
living
blood
left
in
their
veins
iv
the
days
passed
one
by
one
and
the
placid
existence
of
the
island
went
on
almost
without
a
ripple
the
three
companions
obeyed
no
rules
nor
regulations
they
never
did
anything
correctly
either
in
sitting
or
standing
or
turning
themselves
round
or
lying
on
their
back
on
the
contrary
wherever
they
saw
these
things
going
on
precisely
and
exactly
according
to
the
rules
they
gave
way
to
inordinate
laughter
they
remained
unimpressed
altogether
by
the
eternal
gravity
of
those
eternal
regulations
one
day
the
great
court
cards
came
to
the
son
of
the
kotwal
and
the
son
of
the
merchant
and
the
prince
why
they
asked
slowly
are
you
not
moving
according
to
the
rules
the
three
companions
answered
because
that
is
our
ichcha
wish
the
great
court
cards
with
hollow
cavernous
voices
as
if
slowly
awakening
from
an
dream
said
together
and
pray
who
is
they
could
not
understand
who
ichcha
was
then
but
the
whole
island
was
to
understand
it
the
first
glimmer
of
light
passed
the
threshold
of
their
minds
when
they
found
out
through
watching
the
actions
of
the
prince
that
they
might
move
in
a
straight
line
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
one
in
which
they
had
always
gone
before
then
they
made
another
startling
discovery
that
there
was
another
side
to
the
cards
which
they
had
never
yet
noticed
with
attention
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
change
now
that
the
change
had
begun
the
three
companions
were
able
to
initiate
them
more
and
more
deeply
into
the
mysteries
of
ichcha
the
cards
gradually
became
aware
that
life
was
not
bound
by
regulations
they
began
to
feel
a
secret
satisfaction
in
the
kingly
power
of
choosing
for
themselves
but
with
this
first
impact
of
ichcha
the
whole
pack
of
cards
began
to
totter
slowly
and
then
tumble
down
to
the
ground
the
scene
was
like
that
of
some
huge
python
awaking
from
a
long
sleep
as
it
slowly
unfolds
its
numberless
coils
with
a
quiver
that
runs
through
its
whole
frame
v
hitherto
the
queens
of
spades
and
clubs
and
diamonds
and
hearts
had
remained
behind
curtains
with
eyes
that
gazed
vacantly
into
space
or
else
remained
fixed
upon
the
ground
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
on
an
afternoon
in
spring
the
queen
of
hearts
from
the
balcony
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
for
a
moment
and
cast
a
single
glance
upon
the
prince
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
great
god
cried
the
prince
i
thought
they
were
all
painted
images
but
i
am
wrong
they
are
women
after
all
then
the
young
prince
called
to
his
side
his
two
companions
and
said
in
a
meditative
voice
my
comrades
there
is
a
charm
about
these
ladies
that
i
never
noticed
before
when
i
saw
that
glance
of
the
queen
dark
luminous
eyes
brightening
with
new
emotion
it
seemed
to
me
like
the
first
faint
streak
of
dawn
in
a
newly
created
world
the
two
companions
smiled
a
knowing
smile
and
said
is
that
really
so
prince
and
the
poor
queen
of
hearts
from
that
day
went
from
bad
to
worse
she
began
to
forget
all
rules
in
a
truly
scandalous
manner
if
for
instance
her
place
in
the
row
was
beside
the
knave
she
suddenly
found
herself
quite
accidentally
standing
beside
the
prince
instead
at
this
the
knave
with
motionless
face
and
solemn
voice
would
say
queen
you
have
made
a
mistake
and
the
poor
queen
of
hearts
red
cheeks
would
get
redder
than
ever
but
the
prince
would
come
gallantly
to
her
rescue
and
say
no
there
is
no
mistake
from
i
am
going
to
be
knave
now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
every
one
was
trying
to
correct
the
improprieties
of
the
guilty
queen
of
hearts
they
began
to
make
mistakes
themselves
the
aces
found
themselves
elbowed
out
by
the
kings
the
kings
got
muddled
up
with
the
knaves
the
nines
and
tens
assumed
airs
as
though
they
belonged
to
the
great
court
cards
the
twos
and
threes
were
found
secretly
taking
the
places
specially
resented
for
the
fours
and
fives
confusion
had
never
been
so
confounded
before
many
spring
seasons
had
come
and
gone
in
that
island
of
cards
the
kokil
the
bird
of
spring
had
sung
its
song
year
after
year
but
it
had
never
stirred
the
blood
as
it
stirred
it
now
in
days
gone
by
the
sea
had
sung
its
tireless
melody
but
then
it
had
proclaimed
only
the
inflexible
monotony
of
the
rule
and
suddenly
its
waves
were
telling
through
all
their
flashing
light
and
luminous
shade
and
myriad
voices
the
deepest
yearnings
of
the
heart
of
love
vi
where
are
vanished
now
their
prim
round
regular
complacent
features
here
is
a
face
full
of
longing
here
is
a
heart
heating
wild
with
regrets
here
is
a
mind
racked
sore
with
doubts
music
and
sighing
and
smiles
and
tears
are
filling
the
air
life
is
throbbing
hearts
are
breaking
passions
are
kindling
every
one
is
now
thinking
of
his
own
appearance
and
comparing
himself
with
others
the
ace
of
clubs
is
musing
to
himself
that
the
king
of
spades
may
be
just
passably
but
says
he
when
i
walk
down
the
street
you
have
only
to
see
how
people
eyes
turn
towards
me
the
king
of
spades
is
saying
why
on
earth
is
that
ace
of
clubs
always
straining
his
neck
and
strutting
about
like
a
peacock
he
imagines
all
the
queens
are
dying
of
love
for
him
while
the
real
fact
is
here
he
pauses
and
examines
his
face
in
the
glass
but
the
queens
were
the
worst
of
all
they
began
to
spend
all
their
time
in
dressing
themselves
up
to
the
nines
and
the
nines
would
become
their
hopeless
and
abject
slaves
but
their
cutting
remarks
about
one
another
were
more
shocking
still
so
the
young
men
would
sit
listless
on
the
leaves
under
the
trees
lolling
with
outstretched
limbs
in
the
forest
shade
and
the
young
maidens
dressed
in
robes
would
come
walking
accidentally
to
the
same
shade
of
the
same
forest
by
the
same
trees
and
turn
their
eyes
as
though
they
saw
no
one
there
and
look
as
though
they
came
out
to
see
nothing
at
all
and
then
one
young
man
more
forward
than
the
rest
in
a
fit
of
madness
would
dare
to
go
near
to
a
maiden
in
blue
but
as
he
drew
near
speech
would
forsake
him
he
would
stand
there
and
foolish
and
the
favourable
moment
would
pass
the
kokil
birds
were
singing
in
the
boughs
overhead
the
mischievous
south
wind
was
blowing
it
disarrayed
the
hair
it
whispered
in
the
ear
and
stirred
the
music
in
the
blood
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
murmuring
with
rustling
delight
and
the
ceaseless
sound
of
the
ocean
made
all
the
mute
longings
of
the
heart
of
man
and
maid
surge
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
full
springtide
of
love
the
three
companions
had
brought
into
the
channels
of
the
kingdom
of
cards
the
full
of
a
new
life
vii
and
though
the
tide
was
full
a
pause
as
though
the
rising
waters
would
not
break
into
foam
but
remain
suspended
for
ever
there
were
no
outspoken
words
only
a
cautious
going
forward
one
step
and
receding
two
all
seemed
busy
heaping
up
their
unfulfilled
desires
like
castles
in
the
air
or
fortresses
of
sand
they
were
pale
and
speechless
their
eyes
were
burning
their
lips
trembling
with
unspoken
secrets
the
prince
saw
what
was
wrong
he
summoned
every
one
on
the
island
and
said
bring
hither
the
flutes
and
the
cymbals
the
pipes
and
drums
let
all
be
played
together
and
raise
loud
shouts
of
rejoicing
for
the
queen
of
hearts
this
very
night
is
going
to
choose
her
mate
so
the
tens
and
nines
began
to
blow
on
their
flutes
and
pipes
the
eights
and
sevens
played
on
their
sackbuts
and
viols
and
even
the
twos
and
threes
began
to
beat
madly
on
their
drums
when
this
tumultous
gust
of
music
came
it
swept
away
at
one
blast
all
those
sighings
and
mopings
and
then
what
a
torrent
of
laughter
and
words
poured
forth
there
were
daring
proposals
and
locking
refusals
and
gossip
and
chatter
and
jests
and
merriment
it
was
like
the
swaying
and
shaking
and
rustling
and
soughing
in
a
summer
gale
of
a
million
leaves
and
branches
in
the
depth
of
the
primeval
forest
but
the
queen
of
hearts
in
a
robe
sat
silent
in
the
shadow
of
her
secret
bower
and
listened
to
the
great
uproarious
sound
of
music
and
mirth
that
came
floating
towards
her
she
shut
her
eyes
and
dreamt
her
dream
of
lore
and
when
she
opened
them
she
found
the
prince
seated
on
the
ground
before
her
gazing
up
at
her
face
and
she
covered
her
eyes
with
both
hands
and
shrank
back
quivering
with
an
inward
tumult
of
joy
and
the
prince
passed
the
whole
day
alone
walking
by
the
side
of
the
surging
sea
he
carried
in
his
mind
that
startled
look
that
shrinking
gesture
of
the
queen
and
his
heart
beat
high
with
hope
that
night
the
serried
ranks
of
young
men
and
maidens
waited
with
smiling
faces
at
the
palace
gates
the
palace
hall
was
lighted
with
fairy
lamps
and
festooned
with
the
flowers
of
spring
slowly
the
queen
of
hearts
entered
and
the
whole
assembly
rose
to
greet
her
with
a
jasmine
garland
in
her
hand
she
stood
before
the
prince
with
downcast
eyes
in
her
lowly
bashfulness
she
could
hardly
raise
the
garland
to
the
neck
of
the
mate
she
had
chosen
but
the
prince
bowed
his
head
and
the
garland
slipped
to
its
place
the
assembly
of
youths
and
maidens
had
waited
her
choice
with
eager
expectant
hush
and
when
the
choice
was
made
the
whole
vast
concourse
rocked
and
swayed
with
a
tumult
of
wild
delight
and
the
sound
of
their
shouts
was
heard
in
every
part
of
the
island
and
by
ships
far
out
at
sea
never
had
such
a
shout
been
raised
in
the
kingdom
of
cards
before
and
they
carried
the
prince
and
his
bride
and
seated
them
on
the
throne
and
crowned
them
then
and
there
in
the
ancient
island
of
cards
and
the
sorrowing
mother
queen
on
the
island
shore
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
came
sailing
to
her
son
new
kingdom
in
a
ship
adorned
with
gold
and
the
citizens
are
no
longer
regulated
according
to
the
rules
but
are
good
or
bad
or
both
according
to
their
ichcha
the
devotee
at
a
time
when
my
unpopularity
with
a
part
of
my
readers
had
reached
the
nadir
of
its
glory
and
my
name
had
become
the
central
orb
of
the
journals
to
be
attended
through
space
with
a
perpetual
rotation
of
revilement
i
felt
the
necessity
to
retire
to
some
quiet
place
and
endeavour
to
forget
my
own
existence
i
have
a
house
in
the
country
some
miles
away
from
calcutta
where
i
can
remain
unknown
and
unmolested
the
villagers
there
have
not
as
yet
come
to
any
conclusion
about
me
they
know
i
am
no
mere
or
for
i
never
outrage
the
silence
of
the
village
nights
with
the
riotous
noises
of
the
city
nor
do
they
regard
me
as
ascetic
because
the
little
acquaintance
they
have
of
me
carries
the
savour
of
comfort
about
it
i
am
not
to
them
a
traveller
for
though
i
am
a
vagabond
by
nature
my
wandering
through
the
village
fields
is
aimless
they
are
hardly
even
quite
certain
whether
i
am
married
or
single
for
they
have
never
seen
me
with
my
children
so
not
being
able
to
classify
me
in
any
animal
or
vegetable
kingdom
that
they
know
they
have
long
since
given
me
up
and
left
me
stolidly
alone
but
quite
lately
i
have
come
to
know
that
there
is
one
person
in
the
village
who
is
deeply
interested
in
me
our
acquaintance
began
on
a
sultry
afternoon
in
july
there
had
been
rain
all
the
morning
and
the
air
was
still
wet
and
heavy
with
mist
like
eyelids
when
weeping
is
over
i
sat
lazily
watching
a
dappled
cow
grazing
on
the
high
bank
of
the
river
the
afternoon
sun
was
playing
on
her
glossy
hide
the
simple
beauty
of
this
dress
of
light
made
me
wonder
idly
at
man
deliberate
waste
of
money
in
setting
up
tailors
shops
to
deprive
his
own
skin
of
its
natural
clothing
while
i
was
thus
watching
and
lazily
musing
a
woman
of
middle
age
came
and
prostrated
herself
before
me
touching
the
ground
with
her
forehead
she
carried
in
her
robe
some
bunches
of
flowers
one
of
which
she
offered
to
me
with
folded
hands
she
said
to
me
as
she
offered
it
this
is
an
offering
to
my
god
she
went
away
i
was
so
taken
aback
as
she
uttered
these
words
that
i
could
hardly
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
before
she
was
gone
the
whole
incident
was
entirely
simple
but
it
left
a
deep
impression
on
my
mind
and
as
i
turned
back
once
more
to
look
at
the
cattle
in
the
field
the
zest
of
life
in
the
cow
who
was
munching
the
lush
grass
with
deep
breaths
while
she
whisked
off
the
flies
appeared
to
me
fraught
with
mystery
my
readers
may
laugh
at
my
foolishness
but
my
heart
was
full
of
adoration
i
offered
my
worship
to
the
pure
joy
of
living
which
is
god
own
life
then
plucking
a
tender
shoot
from
the
mango
tree
i
fed
the
cow
with
it
from
my
own
hand
and
as
i
did
this
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
pleased
my
god
the
next
year
when
i
returned
to
the
village
it
was
february
the
cold
season
still
lingered
on
the
morning
sun
came
into
my
room
and
i
was
grateful
for
its
warmth
i
was
writing
when
the
servant
came
to
tell
me
that
a
devotee
of
the
vishnu
cult
wanted
to
see
me
i
told
him
in
an
absent
way
to
bring
her
upstairs
and
went
on
with
my
writing
the
devotee
came
in
and
bowed
to
me
touching
my
feet
i
found
that
she
was
the
same
woman
whom
i
had
met
for
a
brief
moment
a
year
ago
i
was
able
now
to
examine
her
more
closely
she
was
past
that
age
when
one
asks
the
question
whether
a
woman
is
beautiful
or
not
her
stature
was
above
the
ordinary
height
and
she
was
strongly
built
but
her
body
was
slightly
bent
owing
to
her
constant
attitude
of
veneration
her
manner
had
nothing
shrinking
about
it
the
most
remarkable
of
her
features
were
her
two
eyes
they
seemed
to
have
a
penetrating
power
which
could
make
distance
near
with
those
two
large
eyes
of
hers
she
seemed
to
push
me
as
she
entered
what
is
this
she
asked
why
have
you
brought
me
here
before
your
throne
my
god
i
used
to
see
you
among
the
trees
and
that
was
much
better
that
was
the
true
place
to
meet
you
she
must
have
seen
me
walking
in
the
garden
without
my
seeing
her
for
the
last
few
clays
however
i
had
suffered
from
a
cold
and
had
been
prevented
from
going
out
i
had
perforce
to
stay
indoors
and
pay
my
homage
to
the
evening
sky
from
my
terrace
after
a
silent
pause
the
devotee
said
to
me
o
my
god
give
me
some
words
of
good
i
was
quite
unprepared
for
this
abrupt
request
and
answered
her
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
good
words
i
neither
give
nor
receive
i
simply
open
my
eyes
and
keep
silence
and
then
i
can
at
once
both
hear
and
see
even
when
no
sound
is
uttered
now
while
i
am
looking
at
you
it
is
as
good
as
listening
to
your
voice
the
devotee
became
quite
excited
as
i
spoke
and
exclaimed
god
speaks
to
me
not
only
with
his
mouth
but
with
his
whole
body
i
said
to
her
when
i
am
silent
i
can
listen
with
my
whole
body
i
have
come
away
from
calcutta
here
to
listen
to
that
sound
the
devotee
said
yes
i
know
that
and
therefore
i
have
come
here
to
sit
by
you
before
taking
her
leave
she
again
bowed
to
me
and
touched
my
feet
i
could
see
that
she
was
distressed
because
my
feet
were
covered
she
wished
them
to
be
bare
early
next
morning
i
came
out
and
sat
on
my
terrace
on
the
roof
beyond
the
line
of
trees
southward
i
could
see
the
open
country
chill
and
desolate
i
could
watch
the
sun
rising
over
the
in
the
east
beyond
the
clump
of
trees
at
the
side
of
the
village
out
of
the
deep
shadow
of
those
dark
trees
the
village
road
suddenly
appeared
it
stretched
forward
winding
its
way
to
some
distant
villages
on
the
horizon
till
it
was
lost
in
the
grey
of
the
mist
that
morning
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
the
sun
had
risen
or
not
a
white
fog
was
still
clinging
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
saw
the
devotee
walking
through
the
blurred
dawn
like
a
of
the
morning
twilight
she
was
singing
her
chant
to
god
and
sounding
her
cymbals
the
thick
haze
lifted
at
last
and
the
sun
like
the
kindly
grandsire
of
the
village
took
his
seat
amid
all
the
work
that
was
going
on
in
home
and
field
when
i
had
just
settled
down
at
my
to
appease
the
hungry
appetite
of
my
editor
in
calcutta
there
came
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stair
and
the
devotee
humming
a
tune
to
herself
entered
and
bowed
before
me
i
lifted
my
head
from
my
papers
she
said
to
me
my
god
yesterday
i
took
as
sacred
food
what
was
left
over
from
your
meal
i
was
startled
and
asked
her
how
she
could
do
that
oh
she
said
i
waited
at
your
door
in
the
evening
while
you
were
at
dinner
and
took
some
food
from
your
plate
when
it
was
carried
out
this
was
a
surprise
to
me
for
every
one
in
the
village
knew
that
i
had
been
to
europe
and
had
eaten
with
europeans
i
was
a
vegetarian
no
doubt
but
the
sanctity
of
my
cook
would
not
bear
investigation
and
the
orthodox
regarded
my
food
as
polluted
the
devotee
noticing
my
sign
of
surprise
said
my
god
why
should
i
come
to
you
at
all
if
i
could
not
take
your
food
i
asked
her
what
her
own
caste
people
would
say
she
told
me
she
had
already
spread
the
news
far
and
wide
all
over
the
village
the
caste
people
had
shaken
their
heads
but
agreed
that
she
must
go
her
own
way
i
found
out
that
the
devotee
came
from
a
good
family
in
the
country
and
that
her
mother
was
well
and
desired
to
keep
her
daughter
but
she
preferred
to
be
a
mendicant
i
asked
her
how
she
made
her
living
she
told
me
that
her
followers
had
given
her
a
piece
of
land
and
that
she
begged
her
food
from
door
to
door
she
said
to
me
the
food
which
i
get
by
begging
is
divine
after
i
had
thought
over
what
she
said
i
understood
her
meaning
when
we
get
our
food
precariously
as
alms
we
remember
god
the
giver
but
when
we
receive
our
food
regularly
at
home
as
a
matter
of
course
we
are
apt
to
regard
it
as
ours
by
right
i
had
a
great
desire
to
ask
her
about
her
husband
but
as
she
never
mentioned
him
even
indirectly
i
did
not
question
her
i
found
out
very
soon
that
the
devotee
had
no
respect
at
all
for
that
part
of
the
village
where
the
people
of
the
higher
castes
lived
they
never
give
she
said
a
single
farthing
to
god
service
and
yet
they
have
the
largest
share
of
god
glebe
but
the
poor
worship
and
starve
i
asked
her
why
she
did
not
go
and
live
among
these
godless
people
and
help
them
towards
a
better
life
that
i
said
with
some
unction
would
be
the
highest
form
of
divine
worship
i
had
heard
sermons
of
this
kind
from
time
to
time
and
i
am
rather
fond
of
copying
them
myself
for
the
public
benefit
when
the
chance
comes
but
the
devotee
was
not
at
all
impressed
she
raised
her
big
round
eyes
and
looked
straight
into
mine
and
said
you
mean
to
say
that
because
god
is
with
the
sinners
therefore
when
you
do
them
any
service
you
do
it
to
god
is
that
so
yes
i
replied
that
is
my
meaning
of
course
she
answered
almost
impatiently
of
course
god
is
with
them
otherwise
how
could
they
go
on
living
at
all
but
what
is
that
to
me
my
god
is
not
there
my
god
can
not
be
worshipped
among
them
because
i
do
not
find
him
there
i
seek
him
where
i
can
find
him
as
she
spoke
she
made
obeisance
to
me
what
she
meant
to
say
was
really
this
a
mere
doctrine
of
god
omnipresence
does
not
help
us
that
god
is
this
truth
may
be
a
mere
intangible
abstraction
and
therefore
unreal
to
ourselves
where
i
can
see
him
there
is
his
reality
in
my
soul
i
need
not
explain
that
all
the
while
she
showered
her
devotion
on
me
she
did
it
to
me
not
as
an
individual
i
was
simply
a
vehicle
of
her
divine
worship
it
was
not
for
me
either
to
receive
it
or
to
refuse
it
for
it
was
not
mine
but
god
when
the
devotee
came
again
she
found
me
once
more
engaged
with
my
books
and
papers
what
have
you
been
doing
she
said
with
evident
vexation
that
my
god
should
make
you
undertake
such
drudgery
whenever
i
come
i
find
you
reading
and
writing
god
keeps
his
useless
people
busy
i
answered
otherwise
they
would
be
bound
to
get
into
mischief
they
have
to
do
all
the
least
necessary
things
in
life
it
keeps
them
out
of
trouble
the
devotee
told
me
that
she
could
not
bear
the
encumbrances
with
which
day
by
day
i
was
surrounded
if
she
wanted
to
see
me
she
was
not
allowed
by
the
servants
to
come
straight
upstairs
if
she
wanted
to
touch
my
feet
in
worship
there
were
my
socks
always
in
the
way
and
when
she
wanted
to
have
a
simple
talk
with
me
she
found
my
mind
lost
in
a
wilderness
of
letters
this
time
before
she
left
me
she
folded
her
hands
and
said
my
god
i
felt
your
feet
in
my
breast
this
morning
oh
how
cool
and
they
were
bare
not
covered
i
held
them
upon
my
head
for
a
long
time
in
worship
that
filled
my
very
being
then
after
that
pray
what
was
the
use
of
my
coming
to
you
yourself
why
did
i
come
my
lord
tell
me
truly
it
a
mere
infatuation
there
were
some
flowers
in
my
vase
on
the
table
while
she
was
there
the
gardener
brought
some
new
flowers
to
put
in
their
place
the
devotee
saw
him
changing
them
is
that
all
she
exclaimed
have
you
done
with
the
flowers
then
give
them
to
me
she
held
the
flowers
tenderly
in
the
cup
of
her
hands
and
began
to
gaze
at
them
with
bent
head
after
a
few
moments
silence
she
raised
her
head
again
and
said
to
me
you
never
look
at
these
flowers
therefore
they
become
stale
to
you
if
you
would
only
look
into
them
then
your
reading
and
writing
would
go
to
the
winds
she
tied
the
flowers
together
in
the
end
of
her
robe
and
placed
them
in
an
attitude
of
worship
on
the
top
of
her
head
saying
reverently
let
me
carry
my
god
with
me
while
she
did
this
i
felt
that
flowers
in
our
rooms
do
not
receive
their
due
meed
of
loving
care
at
our
hands
when
we
stick
them
in
vases
they
are
more
like
a
row
of
naughty
schoolboys
standing
on
a
form
to
be
punished
the
devotee
came
again
the
same
evening
and
sat
by
my
feet
on
the
terrace
of
the
roof
i
gave
away
those
flowers
she
said
as
i
went
from
house
to
house
this
morning
singing
god
name
beni
the
head
man
of
our
village
laughed
at
me
for
my
devotion
and
said
do
you
waste
all
this
devotion
on
him
do
you
know
he
is
reviled
up
and
down
the
countryside
is
that
true
my
god
is
it
true
that
they
are
hard
upon
you
for
a
moment
i
shrank
into
myself
it
was
a
shock
to
find
that
the
stains
of
printers
ink
could
reach
so
far
the
devotee
went
on
beni
imagined
that
he
could
blow
out
the
flame
of
my
devotion
at
one
breath
but
this
is
no
mere
tiny
flame
it
is
a
burning
fire
why
do
they
abuse
you
my
god
i
said
because
i
deserved
it
i
suppose
in
my
greed
i
was
loitering
about
to
steal
people
hearts
in
secret
the
devotee
said
now
you
see
for
yourself
how
little
their
hearts
are
worth
they
are
full
of
poison
and
this
will
cure
you
of
your
greed
when
a
man
i
answered
has
greed
in
his
heart
he
is
always
on
the
verge
of
being
beaten
the
greed
itself
supplies
his
enemies
with
poison
our
merciful
god
she
replied
beats
us
with
his
own
hand
and
drives
away
all
the
poison
he
who
endures
god
beating
to
the
end
is
saved
ii
that
evening
the
devotee
told
me
the
story
of
her
life
the
stars
of
evening
rose
and
set
behind
the
trees
as
she
went
on
to
the
end
of
her
tale
my
husband
is
very
simple
some
people
think
that
he
is
a
simpleton
but
i
know
that
those
who
understand
simply
understand
truly
in
business
and
household
management
he
was
able
to
hold
his
own
because
his
needs
were
small
and
his
wants
few
he
could
manage
carefully
on
what
we
had
he
would
never
meddle
in
other
matters
nor
try
to
understand
them
both
my
husband
parents
died
before
we
had
been
married
long
and
we
were
left
alone
but
my
husband
always
needed
some
one
to
be
over
him
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
had
a
sort
of
reverence
for
me
and
looked
upon
me
as
his
superior
but
i
am
sure
that
he
could
understand
things
better
than
i
though
i
had
greater
powers
of
talking
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
he
held
his
guru
thakur
spiritual
master
in
the
highest
veneration
indeed
it
was
not
veneration
merely
but
love
and
such
love
as
his
is
rare
guru
thakur
was
younger
than
my
husband
oh
how
beautiful
he
was
my
husband
had
played
games
with
him
when
he
was
a
boy
and
from
that
time
forward
he
had
dedicated
his
heart
and
soul
to
this
friend
of
his
early
days
thakur
knew
how
simple
my
husband
was
and
used
to
tease
him
mercilessly
he
and
his
comrades
would
play
jokes
upon
him
for
their
own
amusement
but
he
would
bear
them
all
with
longsuffering
when
i
married
into
this
family
guru
thakur
was
studying
at
benares
my
husband
used
to
pay
all
his
expenses
i
was
eighteen
years
old
when
he
returned
home
to
our
village
at
the
age
of
fifteen
i
had
my
child
i
was
so
young
i
did
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
him
i
was
fond
of
gossip
and
liked
to
be
with
my
village
friends
for
hours
together
i
used
to
get
quite
cross
with
my
boy
when
i
was
compelled
to
stay
at
home
and
nurse
him
alas
my
came
into
my
life
but
his
playthings
were
not
ready
for
him
he
came
to
the
mother
heart
but
the
mother
heart
lagged
behind
he
left
me
in
anger
and
ever
since
i
have
been
searching
for
him
up
and
down
the
world
the
boy
was
the
joy
of
his
father
life
my
careless
neglect
used
to
pain
my
husband
but
his
was
a
mute
soul
he
has
never
been
able
to
give
expression
to
his
pain
the
wonderful
thing
was
this
that
in
spite
of
my
neglect
the
child
used
to
love
me
more
than
any
one
else
he
seemed
to
have
the
dread
that
i
would
one
day
go
away
and
leave
him
so
even
when
i
was
with
him
he
would
watch
me
with
a
restless
look
in
his
eyes
he
had
me
very
little
to
himself
and
therefore
his
desire
to
be
with
me
was
always
painfully
eager
when
i
went
each
day
to
the
river
he
used
to
fret
and
stretch
out
his
little
arms
to
be
taken
with
me
but
the
bathing
ghal
was
my
place
for
meeting
my
friends
and
i
did
not
care
to
burden
myself
with
the
child
it
was
an
early
morning
in
august
fold
after
fold
of
grey
clouds
had
wrapped
the
round
with
a
wet
clinging
robe
i
asked
the
maid
to
take
care
of
the
boy
while
i
went
down
to
the
river
the
child
cried
after
me
as
i
went
away
there
was
no
one
there
at
the
bathing
ghat
when
i
arrived
as
a
swimmer
i
was
the
best
among
all
the
village
women
the
river
was
quite
full
with
the
rains
i
swam
out
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
some
distance
from
the
shore
then
i
heard
a
cry
from
the
bank
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
my
boy
coming
down
the
steps
calling
me
as
he
came
i
shouted
to
him
to
stop
but
he
went
on
laughing
and
calling
my
feet
and
hands
became
cramped
with
fear
i
shut
my
eyes
afraid
to
see
when
i
opened
them
there
at
the
slippery
stairs
my
boy
ripple
of
laughter
had
disappeared
for
ever
i
got
back
to
the
shore
i
raised
him
from
the
water
i
took
him
in
my
arms
my
boy
my
darling
who
had
begged
so
often
in
vain
for
me
to
take
him
i
took
him
now
but
he
no
more
looked
in
my
eyes
and
called
my
had
come
i
had
ever
neglected
him
i
had
ever
made
him
cry
and
now
all
that
neglect
began
to
beat
against
my
own
heart
blow
upon
blow
blow
upon
blow
when
my
boy
was
with
me
i
had
left
him
alone
i
had
refused
to
take
him
with
me
and
now
when
he
is
dead
his
memory
clings
to
me
and
never
leaves
me
god
alone
knows
all
that
my
husband
suffered
if
he
had
only
punished
me
for
my
sin
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
but
he
knew
only
how
to
endure
in
silence
not
how
to
speak
when
i
was
almost
mad
with
grief
guru
thakur
came
back
in
earlier
days
the
relation
between
him
and
my
husband
had
been
that
of
boyish
friendship
now
my
husband
reverence
for
his
sanctity
and
learning
was
unbounded
he
could
hardly
speak
in
his
presence
his
awe
of
him
was
so
great
my
husband
asked
his
guru
to
try
to
give
me
some
consolation
guru
thakur
began
to
read
and
explain
to
me
the
scriptures
but
i
do
not
think
they
had
much
effect
on
my
mind
all
their
value
for
me
lay
in
the
voice
that
uttered
them
god
makes
the
draught
of
divine
life
deepest
in
the
heart
for
man
to
drink
through
the
human
voice
he
has
no
better
vessel
in
his
hand
than
that
and
he
himself
drinks
his
divine
draught
out
of
the
same
vessel
my
husband
love
and
veneration
for
his
guru
filled
our
house
as
incense
fills
a
temple
shrine
i
showed
that
veneration
and
had
peace
i
saw
my
god
in
the
form
of
that
guru
he
used
to
come
to
take
his
meal
at
our
house
every
morning
the
first
thought
that
would
come
to
my
mind
on
waking
from
sleep
was
that
of
his
food
as
a
sacred
gift
from
god
when
i
prepared
the
things
for
his
meal
my
fingers
would
sing
for
joy
when
my
husband
saw
my
devotion
to
his
guru
his
respect
for
me
greatly
increased
he
noticed
his
guru
eager
desire
to
explain
the
scriptures
to
me
he
used
to
think
that
he
could
never
expect
to
earn
any
regard
from
his
guru
himself
on
account
of
his
stupidity
but
his
wife
had
made
up
for
it
thus
another
five
years
went
by
happily
and
my
whole
life
would
have
passed
like
that
but
beneath
the
surface
some
stealing
was
going
on
somewhere
in
secret
i
could
not
detect
it
but
it
was
detected
by
the
god
of
my
heart
then
came
a
day
when
in
a
moment
our
whole
life
was
turned
upside
down
it
was
a
morning
in
midsummer
i
was
returning
home
from
bathing
my
clothes
all
wet
down
a
shady
lane
at
the
bend
of
the
road
under
the
mango
tree
i
met
my
guru
thakur
he
had
his
towel
on
his
shoulder
and
was
repeating
some
sanskrit
verses
as
he
was
going
to
take
his
bath
with
my
wet
clothes
clinging
all
about
me
i
was
ashamed
to
meet
him
i
tried
to
pass
by
quickly
and
avoid
being
seen
he
called
me
by
my
name
i
stopped
lowering
my
eyes
shrinking
into
myself
he
fixed
his
gaze
upon
me
and
said
beautiful
is
your
body
all
the
universe
of
birds
seemed
to
break
into
song
in
the
branches
overhead
all
the
bushes
in
the
lane
seemed
ablaze
with
flowers
it
was
as
though
the
earth
and
sky
and
everything
had
become
a
riot
of
intoxicating
joy
i
can
not
tell
how
i
got
home
i
only
remember
that
i
rushed
into
the
room
where
we
worship
god
but
the
room
seemed
empty
only
before
my
eyes
those
same
gold
spangles
of
light
were
dancing
which
had
quivered
in
front
of
me
in
that
shady
lane
on
my
way
back
from
the
river
guru
thakur
came
to
take
his
food
that
day
and
asked
my
husband
where
i
had
gone
he
searched
for
me
but
could
not
find
me
anywhere
ah
i
have
not
the
same
earth
now
any
longer
the
same
sunlight
is
not
mine
i
called
on
my
god
in
my
dismay
and
he
kept
his
face
turned
away
from
me
the
day
passed
i
know
not
how
that
night
i
had
to
meet
my
husband
but
the
night
is
dark
and
silent
it
is
the
time
when
my
husband
mind
comes
out
shining
like
stars
at
twilight
i
had
heard
him
speak
things
in
the
dark
and
i
had
been
surprised
to
find
how
deeply
he
understood
sometimes
i
am
late
in
the
evening
in
going
to
rest
on
account
of
household
work
my
husband
waits
for
me
seated
on
the
floor
without
going
to
bed
our
talk
at
such
times
had
often
begun
with
something
about
our
guru
that
night
when
it
was
past
midnight
i
came
to
my
room
and
found
my
husband
sleeping
on
the
floor
without
disturbing
him
i
lay
down
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
my
head
towards
him
once
he
stretched
his
feet
while
sleeping
and
struck
me
on
the
breast
that
was
his
last
bequest
next
morning
when
my
husband
woke
up
from
his
sleep
i
was
already
sitting
by
him
outside
the
window
over
the
thick
foliage
of
the
tree
appeared
the
first
pale
red
of
the
dawn
at
the
fringe
of
the
night
it
was
so
early
that
the
crows
had
not
yet
begun
to
call
i
bowed
and
touched
my
husband
feet
with
my
forehead
he
sat
up
starting
as
if
waking
from
a
dream
and
looked
at
my
face
in
amazement
i
said
have
made
up
my
mind
i
must
leave
the
world
i
can
not
belong
to
you
any
longer
i
must
leave
your
home
perhaps
my
husband
thought
that
he
was
still
dreaming
he
said
not
a
word
do
hear
me
i
pleaded
with
infinite
pain
hear
me
and
understand
you
must
marry
another
wife
i
must
take
my
leave
my
husband
said
is
all
this
wild
mad
talk
who
advises
you
to
leave
the
world
i
said
guru
thakur
my
husband
looked
bewildered
thakur
he
cried
did
he
give
you
this
advice
the
morning
i
answered
when
i
met
him
on
my
way
back
from
the
river
his
voice
trembled
a
little
he
turned
and
looked
in
my
face
and
asked
me
did
he
give
you
such
a
behest
do
not
know
i
answered
him
he
will
tell
you
himself
if
he
can
my
husband
said
is
possible
to
leave
the
world
even
when
continuing
to
live
in
it
you
need
not
leave
my
home
i
will
speak
to
my
guru
about
it
guru
i
said
accept
your
petition
but
my
heart
will
never
give
its
consent
i
must
leave
your
home
from
henceforth
the
world
is
no
more
to
me
my
husband
remained
silent
and
we
sat
there
on
the
floor
in
the
dark
when
it
was
light
he
said
to
me
us
both
come
to
him
i
folded
my
hands
and
said
shall
never
meet
him
again
he
looked
into
my
face
i
lowered
my
eyes
he
said
no
more
i
knew
that
somehow
he
had
seen
into
my
mind
and
understood
what
was
there
in
this
world
of
mine
there
were
only
two
who
loved
me
best
my
boy
and
my
husband
that
love
was
my
god
and
therefore
it
could
brook
no
falsehood
one
of
these
two
left
me
and
i
left
the
other
now
i
must
have
truth
and
truth
alone
she
touched
the
ground
at
my
feet
rose
and
bowed
to
me
and
departed
vision
i
when
i
was
a
very
young
wife
i
gave
birth
to
a
dead
child
and
came
near
to
death
myself
i
recovered
strength
very
slowly
and
my
eyesight
became
weaker
and
weaker
my
husband
at
this
time
was
studying
medicine
he
was
not
altogether
sorry
to
have
a
chance
of
testing
his
medical
knowledge
on
me
so
he
began
to
treat
my
eyes
himself
my
elder
brother
was
reading
for
his
law
examination
one
day
he
came
to
see
me
and
was
alarmed
at
my
condition
what
are
you
doing
he
said
to
my
husband
you
are
ruining
eyes
you
ought
to
consult
a
good
doctor
at
once
my
husband
said
irritably
why
what
can
a
good
doctor
do
more
than
i
am
doing
the
case
is
quite
a
simple
one
and
the
remedies
are
all
well
known
dada
answered
with
scorn
i
suppose
you
think
there
is
no
difference
between
you
and
a
professor
in
your
own
medical
college
my
husband
replied
angrily
if
you
ever
get
married
and
there
is
a
dispute
about
your
wife
property
you
wo
take
my
advice
about
law
why
then
do
you
now
come
advising
me
about
medicine
while
they
were
quarrelling
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
it
was
always
the
poor
grass
that
suffered
most
when
two
kings
went
to
war
here
was
a
dispute
going
on
between
these
two
and
i
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
it
also
seemed
to
me
very
unfair
that
when
my
family
had
given
me
in
marriage
they
should
interfere
afterwards
after
all
my
pleasure
and
pain
are
my
husband
concern
not
theirs
from
that
day
forward
merely
over
this
trifling
matter
of
my
eyes
the
bond
between
my
husband
and
dada
was
strained
to
my
surprise
one
afternoon
while
my
husband
was
away
dada
brought
a
doctor
in
to
see
me
he
examined
my
eyes
very
carefully
and
looked
grave
he
said
that
further
neglect
would
be
dangerous
he
wrote
out
a
prescription
and
dada
for
the
medicine
at
once
when
the
strange
doctor
had
gone
i
implored
my
dada
not
to
interfere
i
was
sure
that
only
evil
would
come
from
the
stealthy
visits
of
a
doctor
i
was
surprised
at
myself
for
plucking
up
courage
speak
to
my
brother
like
that
i
had
always
hitherto
been
afraid
of
him
i
am
sure
also
that
dada
was
surprised
at
my
boldness
he
kept
silence
for
a
while
and
then
said
to
me
very
well
kumo
i
wo
call
in
the
doctor
any
more
but
when
the
medicine
comes
you
must
take
it
dada
then
went
away
the
medicine
came
from
chemist
i
took
it
bottles
powders
prescriptions
and
all
and
threw
it
down
the
well
my
husband
had
been
irritated
by
dada
interference
and
he
began
to
treat
my
eyes
with
greater
diligence
than
ever
he
tried
all
sorts
of
remedies
i
bandaged
my
eyes
as
he
told
me
i
wore
his
coloured
glasses
i
put
in
his
drops
i
took
all
his
powders
i
even
drank
the
oil
he
gave
me
though
my
gorge
rose
against
it
each
time
he
came
back
from
the
hospital
he
would
ask
me
anxiously
how
i
felt
and
i
would
answer
oh
much
better
indeed
i
became
an
expert
in
when
i
found
that
the
water
in
my
eyes
was
still
increasing
i
would
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
get
rid
of
so
much
bad
fluid
and
when
the
flow
of
water
in
my
eyes
decreased
i
was
elated
at
my
husband
skill
but
after
a
while
the
agony
became
unbearable
my
eyesight
faded
away
and
i
had
continual
headaches
day
and
night
i
saw
how
much
alarmed
my
husband
was
getting
i
gathered
from
his
manner
that
he
was
casting
about
for
a
pretext
to
call
in
a
doctor
so
i
hinted
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
call
one
in
that
he
was
greatly
relieved
i
could
see
he
called
in
an
english
doctor
that
very
day
i
do
not
know
what
talk
they
had
together
but
i
gathered
that
the
sahib
had
spoken
very
sharply
to
my
husband
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
after
the
doctor
had
gone
i
took
his
hands
in
mine
and
said
what
an
brute
that
was
why
did
you
call
in
an
indian
doctor
that
would
have
been
much
better
do
you
think
that
man
knows
better
than
you
do
about
my
eyes
my
husband
was
very
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
said
with
a
broken
voice
kumo
your
eyes
must
be
operated
on
i
pretended
to
be
vexed
with
him
for
concealing
the
fact
from
me
so
long
here
you
have
known
this
all
the
time
said
i
and
yet
you
have
said
nothing
about
it
do
you
think
i
am
such
a
baby
as
to
be
afraid
of
an
operation
at
that
he
regained
his
good
spirits
there
are
very
few
men
said
he
who
are
heroic
enough
to
look
forward
to
an
operation
without
shrinking
i
laughed
at
him
yes
that
is
so
men
are
heroic
only
before
their
wives
he
looked
at
me
gravely
and
said
you
are
perfectly
right
we
men
are
dreadfully
vain
i
laughed
away
his
seriousness
are
you
sure
you
can
beat
us
women
even
in
vanity
when
dada
came
i
took
him
aside
dada
that
treatment
your
doctor
recommended
would
have
done
me
a
world
of
good
only
unfortunately
i
mistook
the
mixture
for
the
lotion
and
since
the
day
i
made
the
mistake
my
eyes
have
grown
steadily
worse
and
now
an
operation
is
needed
dada
said
to
me
you
were
under
your
husband
treatment
and
that
is
why
i
gave
up
coming
to
visit
you
no
i
answered
in
reality
i
was
secretly
treating
myself
in
accordance
with
your
doctor
directions
oh
what
lies
we
women
have
to
tell
when
we
are
mothers
we
tell
lies
to
pacify
our
children
and
when
we
are
wives
we
tell
lies
to
pacify
the
fathers
of
our
children
we
are
never
free
from
this
necessity
my
deception
had
the
effect
of
bringing
about
a
better
feeling
between
my
husband
and
dada
dada
blamed
himself
for
asking
me
to
keep
a
secret
from
my
husband
and
my
husband
regretted
that
he
had
not
taken
my
brother
advice
at
the
first
at
last
with
the
consent
of
both
an
english
doctor
came
and
operated
on
my
left
eye
that
eye
however
was
too
weak
to
bear
the
strain
and
the
last
flickering
glimmer
of
light
went
out
then
the
other
eye
gradually
lost
itself
in
darkness
one
day
my
husband
came
to
my
bedside
i
can
not
brazen
it
out
before
you
any
longer
said
he
kumo
it
is
i
who
have
ruined
your
eyes
i
felt
that
his
voice
was
choking
with
tears
and
so
i
took
up
his
right
hand
in
both
of
mine
and
said
why
you
did
exactly
what
was
right
you
have
dealt
only
with
that
which
was
your
very
own
just
imagine
if
some
strange
doctor
had
come
and
taken
away
my
eyesight
what
consolation
should
i
have
had
then
but
now
i
can
feel
that
all
has
happened
for
the
best
and
my
great
comfort
is
to
know
that
it
is
at
your
hands
i
have
lost
my
eyes
when
ramchandra
found
one
lotus
too
few
with
which
to
worship
god
he
offered
both
his
eyes
in
place
of
the
lotus
and
i
hate
dedicated
my
eyes
to
my
god
from
now
whenever
you
see
something
that
is
a
joy
to
you
then
you
must
describe
it
to
me
and
i
will
feed
upon
your
words
as
a
sacred
gift
left
over
from
your
vision
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
i
said
all
this
there
and
then
for
it
is
impossible
to
speak
these
things
an
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
i
used
to
think
over
words
like
these
for
days
and
days
together
and
when
i
was
very
depressed
or
if
at
any
time
the
light
of
my
devotion
became
dim
and
i
pitied
my
evil
fate
then
i
made
my
mind
utter
these
sentences
one
by
one
as
a
child
repeats
a
story
that
is
told
and
so
i
could
breathe
once
more
the
serener
air
of
peace
and
love
at
the
very
time
of
our
talk
together
i
said
enough
to
show
my
husband
what
was
in
my
heart
kumo
he
said
to
me
the
mischief
i
have
done
by
my
folly
can
never
be
made
good
but
i
can
do
one
thing
i
can
ever
remain
by
your
side
and
try
to
make
up
for
your
want
of
vision
as
much
as
is
in
my
power
no
said
i
that
will
never
do
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
turn
your
house
into
an
hospital
for
the
blind
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
you
must
marry
again
as
i
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
this
was
necessary
my
voice
broke
a
little
i
coughed
and
tried
to
hide
my
emotion
but
he
burst
out
saying
kumo
i
know
i
am
a
fool
and
a
braggart
and
all
that
but
i
am
not
a
villain
if
ever
i
marry
again
i
swear
to
you
i
swear
to
you
the
most
solemn
oath
by
my
family
god
gopinath
may
that
most
hated
of
all
sins
the
sin
of
parricide
fall
on
my
head
ah
i
should
never
never
have
allowed
him
to
swear
that
dreadful
oath
but
tears
were
choking
my
voice
and
i
could
not
say
a
word
for
insufferable
joy
i
hid
my
blind
face
in
my
pillows
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
again
at
last
when
the
first
flood
of
my
tears
was
over
i
drew
his
head
down
to
my
breast
ah
said
i
why
did
you
take
such
a
terrible
oath
do
you
think
i
asked
you
to
marry
again
for
your
own
sordid
pleasure
no
i
was
thinking
of
myself
for
she
could
perform
those
services
which
were
mine
to
give
you
when
i
had
my
sight
services
said
he
services
those
can
be
done
by
servants
do
you
think
i
am
mad
enough
to
bring
a
slave
into
my
house
and
bid
her
share
the
throne
with
this
my
goddess
as
he
said
the
word
goddess
he
held
up
my
face
in
his
hands
and
placed
a
kiss
between
my
brows
at
that
moment
the
third
eye
of
divine
wisdom
was
opened
where
he
kissed
me
and
verily
i
had
a
consecration
i
said
in
my
own
mind
it
is
well
i
am
no
longer
able
to
serve
him
in
the
lower
world
of
household
cares
but
i
shall
rise
to
a
higher
region
i
shall
bring
down
blessings
from
above
no
more
lies
no
more
deceptions
for
me
all
the
littlenesses
and
hypocrisies
of
my
former
life
shall
be
banished
for
ever
that
day
the
whole
day
through
i
felt
a
conflict
going
on
within
me
the
joy
of
the
thought
that
after
this
solemn
oath
it
was
impossible
for
my
husband
to
marry
again
fixed
its
roots
deep
in
my
heart
and
i
could
not
tear
them
out
but
the
new
goddess
who
had
taken
her
new
throne
in
me
said
the
time
might
come
when
it
would
be
good
for
your
husband
to
break
his
oath
and
marry
again
but
the
woman
who
was
within
me
said
that
may
be
but
all
the
same
an
oath
is
an
oath
and
there
is
no
way
out
the
goddess
who
was
within
me
answered
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
exult
over
it
but
the
woman
who
was
within
me
replied
what
you
say
is
quite
true
no
doubt
all
the
same
he
has
taken
his
oath
and
the
same
story
went
on
again
and
again
at
last
the
goddess
frowned
in
silence
and
the
darkness
of
a
horrible
fear
came
down
upon
me
my
repentant
husband
would
not
let
the
servants
do
my
work
he
must
do
it
all
himself
at
first
it
gave
me
unbounded
delight
to
be
dependent
on
him
thus
for
every
little
thing
it
was
a
means
of
keeping
him
by
my
side
and
my
desire
to
have
him
with
me
had
become
intense
since
my
blindness
that
share
of
his
presence
which
my
eyes
had
lost
my
other
senses
craved
when
he
was
absent
from
my
side
i
would
feel
as
if
i
were
hanging
in
and
had
lost
my
hold
of
all
things
tangible
formerly
when
my
husband
came
back
late
from
the
hospital
i
used
to
open
my
window
and
gaze
at
the
road
that
road
was
the
link
which
connected
his
world
with
mine
now
when
i
had
lost
that
link
through
my
blindness
all
my
body
would
go
out
to
seek
him
the
bridge
that
united
us
had
given
way
and
there
was
now
this
unsurpassable
chasm
when
he
left
my
side
the
gulf
seemed
to
yawn
wide
open
i
could
only
wait
for
the
time
when
he
should
cross
back
again
from
his
own
shore
to
mine
but
such
intense
longing
and
such
utter
dependence
can
never
be
good
a
wife
is
a
burden
enough
to
a
man
in
all
conscience
and
to
add
to
it
the
burden
of
this
blindness
was
to
make
his
life
unbearable
i
vowed
that
i
would
suffer
alone
and
never
wrap
my
husband
round
in
the
folds
of
my
darkness
within
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
i
managed
to
train
myself
to
do
all
my
household
duties
by
the
help
of
touch
and
sound
and
smell
in
fact
i
soon
found
that
i
could
get
on
with
greater
skill
than
before
for
sight
often
distracts
rather
than
helps
us
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
these
roving
eyes
of
mine
could
do
their
work
no
longer
all
the
other
senses
took
up
their
several
duties
with
quietude
and
completeness
when
i
had
gained
experience
by
constant
practice
i
would
not
let
my
husband
do
any
more
household
duties
for
me
he
complained
bitterly
at
first
that
i
was
depriving
him
of
his
penance
this
did
not
convince
me
whatever
he
might
say
i
could
feel
that
he
had
a
real
sense
of
relief
when
these
household
duties
were
over
to
serve
daily
a
wife
who
is
blind
can
never
make
up
the
life
of
a
man
ii
my
husband
at
last
had
finished
his
medical
course
he
went
away
from
calcutta
to
a
small
town
to
practise
as
a
doctor
there
in
the
country
i
felt
with
joy
through
all
my
blindness
that
i
was
restored
to
the
arms
of
my
mother
i
had
left
my
village
birthplace
for
calcutta
when
i
was
eight
years
old
since
then
ten
years
had
passed
away
and
in
the
great
city
the
memory
of
my
village
home
had
grown
dim
as
long
as
i
had
eyesight
calcutta
with
its
busy
life
screened
from
view
the
memory
of
my
early
days
but
when
i
lost
my
eyesight
i
knew
for
the
first
time
that
calcutta
allured
only
the
eyes
it
could
not
fill
the
mind
and
now
in
my
blindness
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
shone
out
once
more
like
stars
that
appear
one
by
one
in
the
evening
sky
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
was
the
beginning
of
november
when
we
left
calcutta
for
harsingpur
the
place
was
new
to
me
but
the
scents
and
sounds
of
the
countryside
pressed
round
and
embraced
me
the
morning
breeze
coming
fresh
from
the
newly
ploughed
land
the
sweet
and
tender
smell
of
the
flowering
mustard
the
flute
sounding
in
the
distance
even
the
creaking
noise
of
the
as
it
groaned
over
the
broken
village
road
filled
my
world
with
delight
the
memory
of
my
past
life
with
all
its
ineffable
fragrance
and
sound
became
a
living
present
to
me
and
my
blind
eyes
could
not
tell
me
i
was
wrong
i
went
back
and
lived
over
again
my
childhood
only
one
thing
was
absent
my
mother
was
not
with
me
i
could
see
my
home
with
the
large
peepul
trees
growing
along
the
edge
of
the
village
pool
i
could
picture
in
my
mind
eye
my
old
grandmother
seated
on
the
ground
with
her
thin
wisps
of
hair
untied
warming
her
back
in
the
sun
as
she
made
the
little
round
lentil
balls
to
be
dried
and
used
for
cooking
but
somehow
i
could
not
recall
the
songs
she
used
to
croon
to
herself
in
her
weak
and
quavering
voice
in
the
evening
whenever
i
heard
the
lowing
of
cattle
i
could
almost
watch
the
figure
of
my
mother
going
round
the
sheds
with
lighted
lamp
in
her
hand
the
smell
of
the
wet
fodder
and
the
pungent
smoke
of
the
straw
fire
would
enter
into
my
very
heart
and
in
the
distance
i
seemed
to
hear
the
clanging
of
the
temple
bell
wafted
up
by
the
breeze
from
the
river
bank
calcutta
with
all
its
turmoil
and
gossip
curdles
the
heart
there
all
the
beautiful
duties
of
life
lose
their
freshness
and
innocence
i
remember
one
day
when
a
friend
of
mine
came
in
and
said
to
me
kumo
why
do
you
feel
angry
if
i
had
been
treated
like
you
by
my
husband
i
would
never
look
upon
his
face
again
she
tried
to
make
me
indignant
because
he
had
been
so
long
calling
in
a
doctor
my
blindness
said
i
was
itself
a
sufficient
evil
why
should
i
make
it
worse
by
allowing
hatred
to
grow
up
against
my
husband
my
friend
shook
her
head
in
great
contempt
when
she
heard
such
talk
from
the
lips
of
a
mere
chit
of
a
girl
she
went
away
in
disdain
but
whatever
might
be
my
answer
at
the
time
such
words
as
these
left
their
poison
and
the
venom
was
never
wholly
got
out
of
the
soul
when
once
they
had
been
uttered
so
you
see
calcutta
with
its
gossip
does
harden
the
heart
but
when
i
came
back
to
the
country
all
my
earlier
hopes
and
faiths
all
that
i
held
true
in
life
during
childhood
became
fresh
and
bright
once
more
god
came
to
me
and
filled
my
heart
and
my
world
i
bowed
to
him
and
said
it
is
well
that
thou
has
taken
away
my
eyes
thou
art
with
me
ah
but
i
said
more
than
was
right
it
was
a
presumption
to
say
thou
art
with
me
all
we
can
say
is
this
i
must
be
true
to
thee
even
when
nothing
is
left
for
us
still
we
have
to
go
on
living
iii
we
passed
a
few
happy
months
together
my
husband
gained
some
reputation
in
his
profession
as
a
doctor
and
money
came
with
it
but
there
is
a
mischief
in
money
i
can
not
point
to
any
one
event
but
because
the
blind
have
keener
perceptions
than
other
people
i
could
discern
the
change
which
came
over
my
husband
along
with
the
increase
of
wealth
he
had
a
keen
sense
of
justice
when
he
was
younger
and
had
often
told
me
of
his
great
desire
to
help
the
poor
when
once
he
obtained
a
practice
of
his
own
he
had
a
noble
contempt
far
those
in
his
profession
who
would
not
feel
the
pulse
of
a
poor
patient
before
collecting
his
fee
but
now
i
noticed
a
difference
he
had
become
strangely
hard
once
when
a
poor
woman
came
and
begged
him
out
of
charity
to
save
the
life
of
her
only
child
he
bluntly
refused
and
when
i
implored
him
myself
to
help
her
he
did
his
work
perfunctorily
while
we
were
less
rich
my
husband
disliked
sharp
practice
in
money
matters
he
was
scrupulously
honourable
in
such
things
but
since
he
had
got
a
large
account
at
the
bank
he
was
often
closeted
for
hours
with
some
scamp
of
a
landlord
agent
for
purposes
which
clearly
boded
no
good
where
has
he
drifted
what
has
become
of
this
husband
of
mine
the
husband
i
knew
before
i
was
blind
the
husband
who
kissed
me
that
day
between
my
brows
and
enshrined
me
on
the
throne
of
a
goddess
those
whom
a
sudden
gust
of
passion
brings
down
to
the
dust
can
rise
up
again
with
a
new
strong
impulse
of
goodness
but
those
who
day
by
day
become
dried
up
in
the
very
fibre
of
their
moral
being
those
who
by
some
outer
parasitic
growth
choke
the
inner
life
by
slow
degrees
such
wench
one
day
a
deadness
which
knows
no
healing
the
separation
caused
by
blindness
is
the
merest
physical
trifle
but
ah
it
suffocates
me
to
find
that
he
is
no
longer
with
me
where
he
stood
with
me
in
that
hour
when
we
both
knew
that
i
was
blind
that
is
a
separation
indeed
i
with
my
love
fresh
and
my
faith
unbroken
have
kept
to
the
shelter
of
my
heart
inner
shrine
but
my
husband
has
left
the
cool
shade
of
those
things
that
are
ageless
and
unfading
he
is
fast
disappearing
into
the
barren
waterless
waste
in
his
mad
thirst
for
gold
sometimes
the
suspicion
comes
to
me
that
things
not
so
bad
as
they
seem
that
perhaps
i
exaggerate
because
i
am
blind
it
may
be
that
if
my
eyesight
were
unimpaired
i
should
have
accepted
world
as
i
found
it
this
at
any
rate
was
the
light
in
which
my
husband
looked
at
all
my
moods
and
fancies
one
day
an
old
musalman
came
to
the
house
he
asked
my
husband
to
visit
his
little
i
could
hear
the
old
man
say
baba
i
am
a
poor
man
but
come
with
me
and
allah
will
do
you
good
my
husband
answered
coldly
what
allah
will
do
wo
help
matters
i
want
to
know
what
you
can
do
for
me
when
i
heard
it
i
wondered
in
my
mind
why
god
had
not
made
me
deaf
as
well
as
blind
the
old
man
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
departed
i
sent
my
maid
to
fetch
him
to
my
room
i
met
him
at
the
door
of
the
inner
apartment
and
put
some
money
into
his
hand
please
take
this
from
me
said
i
for
your
little
and
get
a
trustworthy
doctor
to
look
after
her
for
my
husband
but
the
whole
of
that
day
i
could
take
no
food
at
all
in
the
afternoon
when
my
husband
got
up
from
sleep
he
asked
me
why
do
you
look
so
pale
i
was
about
to
say
as
i
used
to
do
in
the
past
oh
it
nothing
but
those
days
of
deception
were
over
and
i
spoke
to
him
plainly
i
have
been
hesitating
i
said
for
days
together
to
tell
you
something
it
has
been
hard
to
think
out
what
exactly
it
was
i
wanted
to
say
even
now
i
may
not
be
able
to
explain
what
i
had
in
my
mind
but
i
am
sure
you
know
what
has
happened
our
lives
have
drifted
apart
my
husband
laughed
in
a
forced
manner
and
said
change
is
the
law
of
nature
i
said
to
him
i
know
that
but
there
are
some
things
that
are
eternal
then
he
became
serious
there
are
many
women
said
he
who
have
a
real
cause
for
sorrow
there
are
some
whose
husbands
do
not
earn
money
there
are
others
whose
husbands
do
not
love
them
but
you
are
making
yourself
wretched
about
nothing
at
all
then
it
became
clear
to
me
that
my
very
blindness
had
conferred
on
me
the
power
of
seeing
a
world
which
is
beyond
all
change
yes
it
is
true
i
am
not
like
other
women
and
my
husband
will
never
understand
me
iv
our
two
lives
went
on
with
their
dull
routine
for
some
time
then
there
was
a
break
in
the
monotony
an
aunt
of
my
husband
came
to
pay
us
a
visit
the
first
thing
she
blurted
out
after
our
first
greeting
was
this
well
krum
it
a
great
pity
you
have
become
blind
but
why
do
you
impose
your
own
affliction
on
your
husband
you
must
get
him
to
another
wife
there
was
an
awkward
pause
if
my
husband
had
only
said
something
in
jest
or
laughed
in
her
face
all
would
have
been
over
but
he
stammered
and
hesitated
and
said
at
last
in
a
nervous
stupid
way
do
you
really
think
so
really
aunt
you
should
talk
like
that
his
aunt
appealed
to
me
was
i
wrong
kumo
i
laughed
a
hollow
laugh
had
not
you
better
said
i
consult
some
one
more
competent
to
decide
the
pickpocket
never
asks
permission
from
the
man
whose
pocket
he
is
going
to
pick
you
are
quite
right
she
replied
blandly
abinash
my
dear
let
us
have
our
little
conference
in
private
what
do
you
say
to
that
after
a
few
days
my
husband
asked
her
in
my
presence
if
she
knew
of
any
girl
of
a
decent
family
who
could
come
and
help
me
in
my
household
work
he
knew
quite
well
that
i
needed
no
help
i
kept
silence
oh
there
are
heaps
of
them
replied
his
aunt
my
cousin
has
a
daughter
who
is
just
of
the
marriageable
age
and
as
nice
a
girl
as
you
could
wish
her
people
would
be
only
too
glad
to
secure
you
as
a
husband
again
there
came
from
him
that
forced
hesitating
laugh
and
he
said
but
i
never
mentioned
marriage
how
could
you
expect
asked
his
aunt
a
girl
of
decent
family
to
come
and
live
in
your
house
without
marriage
he
had
to
admit
that
this
was
reasonable
and
remained
nervously
silent
i
stood
alone
within
the
closed
doors
of
my
blindness
after
he
had
gone
and
called
upon
my
god
and
prayed
o
god
save
my
husband
when
i
was
coming
out
of
the
household
shrine
from
my
morning
worship
a
few
days
later
his
aunt
took
hold
of
both
my
hands
warmly
kumo
here
is
the
girl
said
she
we
were
speaking
about
the
other
day
her
name
is
hemangini
she
will
be
delighted
to
meet
you
hemo
come
here
and
be
introduced
to
your
sister
my
husband
entered
the
room
at
the
same
moment
he
feigned
surprise
when
he
saw
the
strange
girl
and
was
about
to
retire
but
his
aunt
said
abinash
my
dear
what
are
you
running
away
for
there
is
no
need
to
do
that
here
is
my
cousin
daughter
hemangini
come
to
see
you
hemo
make
your
bow
to
him
as
if
taken
quite
by
surprise
he
began
to
ply
his
aunt
with
questions
about
the
when
and
why
and
how
of
the
new
arrival
i
saw
the
hollowness
of
the
whole
thing
and
took
hemangini
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
my
own
room
i
gently
stroked
her
face
and
arms
and
hair
and
found
that
she
was
about
fifteen
years
old
and
very
beautiful
as
i
felt
her
face
she
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
said
why
what
are
you
doing
are
you
hypnotising
me
that
sweet
ringing
laughter
of
hers
swept
away
in
a
moment
all
the
dark
clouds
that
stood
between
us
i
threw
my
right
arm
about
her
neck
dear
one
said
i
i
am
trying
to
see
you
and
again
i
stroked
her
soft
face
with
my
left
hand
trying
to
see
me
she
said
with
a
new
burst
of
laughter
am
i
like
a
vegetable
marrow
grown
in
your
garden
that
you
want
to
feel
me
all
round
to
see
how
soft
i
am
i
suddenly
bethought
me
that
she
did
not
know
i
had
lost
my
sight
sister
i
am
blind
said
i
she
was
silent
i
could
feel
her
big
young
eyes
full
of
curiosity
peering
into
my
face
i
knew
they
were
full
of
pity
then
she
grew
thoughtful
and
puzzled
and
said
after
a
short
pause
oh
i
see
now
that
was
the
reason
your
husband
invited
his
aunt
to
come
and
stay
here
no
i
replied
you
are
quite
mistaken
he
did
not
ask
her
to
come
she
came
of
her
own
accord
hemangini
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
that
just
like
my
aunt
said
she
oh
i
was
it
nice
of
her
to
come
without
any
invitation
but
now
she
come
you
wo
get
her
to
move
for
some
time
i
can
assure
you
then
she
paused
and
looked
puzzled
but
why
did
father
send
me
she
asked
can
you
tell
me
that
the
aunt
had
come
into
the
room
while
we
were
talking
hemangini
said
to
her
when
are
you
thinking
of
going
back
aunt
the
aunt
looked
very
much
upset
what
a
question
to
ask
said
she
i
never
seen
such
a
restless
body
as
you
we
only
just
come
and
you
ask
when
we
going
back
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
hemangini
said
for
this
house
belongs
to
your
near
relations
but
what
about
me
i
tell
you
plainly
i
stop
here
and
then
she
held
my
hand
and
said
what
do
you
think
dear
i
drew
her
to
my
heart
but
said
nothing
the
aunt
was
in
a
great
difficulty
she
felt
the
situation
was
getting
beyond
her
control
so
she
proposed
that
she
and
her
niece
should
go
out
together
to
bathe
no
we
two
will
go
together
said
hemangini
clinging
to
me
the
aunt
gave
in
fearing
opposition
if
she
tried
to
drag
her
away
going
down
to
the
river
hemangini
asked
me
why
do
you
have
children
i
was
startled
by
her
question
and
answered
how
can
i
tell
my
god
has
not
given
me
any
that
is
the
reason
no
that
not
the
reason
said
hemangini
quickly
you
must
have
committed
some
sin
look
at
my
aunt
she
is
childless
it
must
be
because
her
heart
has
some
wickedness
but
what
wickedness
is
in
your
heart
the
words
hurt
me
i
have
no
solution
to
offer
for
the
problem
of
evil
i
sighed
deeply
and
said
in
the
silence
of
my
soul
my
god
thou
knowest
the
reason
gracious
goodness
cried
hemangini
what
are
you
sighing
for
no
one
ever
takes
me
seriously
and
her
laughter
pealed
across
the
river
v
i
found
out
after
this
that
there
were
constant
interruptions
in
my
husband
professional
duties
he
refused
all
calls
from
a
distance
and
would
hurry
away
from
his
patients
even
when
they
were
close
at
hand
formerly
it
was
only
during
the
meals
and
at
that
he
could
come
into
the
inner
apartment
but
now
with
unnecessary
anxiety
for
his
aunt
comfort
he
began
to
visit
her
at
all
hours
of
the
day
i
knew
at
once
that
he
had
come
to
her
room
when
i
heard
her
shouting
for
hemangini
to
bring
in
a
glass
of
water
at
first
the
girl
would
do
what
she
was
told
but
later
on
she
refused
altogether
then
the
aunt
would
call
in
an
endearing
voice
hemo
hemo
hemangini
but
the
girl
would
cling
to
me
with
an
impulse
of
pity
a
sense
of
dread
and
sadness
would
keep
her
silent
sometimes
she
would
shrink
towards
me
like
a
hunted
thing
who
scarcely
knew
what
was
coming
about
this
time
my
brother
came
down
from
calcutta
to
visit
me
i
knew
how
keen
his
powers
of
observation
were
and
what
a
hard
judge
he
was
i
feared
my
husband
would
be
put
on
his
defence
and
have
to
stand
his
trial
before
him
so
i
endeavoured
to
hide
the
true
situation
behind
a
mask
of
noisy
cheerfulness
but
i
am
afraid
i
overdid
the
part
it
was
unnatural
for
me
my
husband
began
to
fidget
openly
and
asked
how
long
my
brother
was
going
to
stay
at
last
his
impatience
became
little
short
of
insulting
and
my
brother
had
no
help
for
it
but
to
leave
before
going
he
placed
his
hand
on
my
head
and
kept
it
there
for
some
time
i
noticed
that
his
hand
shook
and
a
tear
fell
from
his
eyes
as
he
silently
gave
me
his
blessing
i
well
remember
that
it
was
an
evening
in
april
and
a
people
who
had
come
into
the
town
were
going
back
home
from
market
there
was
the
feeling
of
an
impending
storm
in
the
air
the
smell
of
the
wet
earth
and
the
moisture
in
the
wind
were
i
never
keep
a
lighted
lamp
in
my
bedroom
when
i
am
alone
lest
my
clothes
should
catch
fire
or
some
accident
happen
i
sat
on
the
floor
in
my
dark
room
and
called
upon
the
god
of
my
blind
world
o
my
lord
i
cried
thy
face
is
hidden
i
can
not
see
i
am
blind
i
hold
tight
this
broken
rudder
of
a
heart
till
my
hands
bleed
the
waves
have
become
too
strong
for
me
how
long
wilt
thou
try
me
my
god
how
long
i
kept
my
head
prone
upon
the
bedstead
and
began
to
sob
as
i
did
so
i
felt
the
bedstead
move
a
little
the
next
moment
hemangini
was
by
my
side
she
clung
to
my
neck
and
wiped
my
tears
away
silently
i
do
not
know
why
she
had
been
waiting
that
evening
in
the
inner
room
or
why
she
had
been
lying
alone
there
in
the
dusk
she
asked
me
no
question
she
said
no
word
she
simply
placed
her
cool
hand
on
my
forehead
and
kissed
me
and
departed
the
next
morning
hemangini
said
to
her
aunt
in
my
presence
if
you
want
to
stay
on
you
can
but
i
do
i
going
away
home
with
our
family
servant
the
aunt
said
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
go
alone
for
she
was
going
away
also
then
smilingly
and
mincingly
she
brought
out
from
a
plush
case
a
ring
set
with
pearls
look
hemo
said
she
what
a
beautiful
ring
my
abinash
brought
for
you
hemangini
snatched
the
ring
from
her
hand
look
aunt
she
answered
quickly
just
see
how
splendidly
i
aim
and
she
flung
the
ring
into
the
tank
outside
the
window
the
aunt
overwhelmed
with
alarm
vexation
and
surprise
bristled
like
a
hedgehog
she
turned
to
me
and
held
me
by
the
hand
kumo
she
repeated
again
and
again
do
say
a
word
about
this
childish
freak
to
abinash
he
would
be
fearfully
vexed
i
assured
her
that
she
need
not
fear
not
a
word
would
reach
him
about
it
from
my
lips
the
next
day
before
starting
for
home
hemangini
embraced
me
and
said
dearest
keep
me
in
mind
do
not
forget
me
i
stroked
her
face
over
and
over
with
my
fingers
and
said
sister
the
blind
have
long
memories
i
drew
her
head
towards
me
and
kissed
her
hair
and
her
forehead
my
world
suddenly
became
grey
all
the
beauty
and
laughter
and
tender
youth
which
had
nestled
so
close
to
me
vanished
when
hemangini
departed
i
went
groping
about
with
arms
outstretched
seeking
to
find
out
what
was
left
in
my
deserted
world
my
husband
came
in
later
he
affected
a
great
relief
now
that
they
were
gone
but
it
was
exaggerated
and
empty
he
pretended
that
his
visit
had
kept
him
away
from
work
hitherto
there
had
been
only
the
one
barrier
of
blindness
between
me
and
my
husband
now
another
barrier
was
added
this
deliberate
silence
about
hemangini
he
feigned
utter
indifference
but
i
knew
he
was
having
letters
about
her
it
was
early
in
may
my
maid
entered
my
room
one
morning
and
asked
me
what
is
all
this
preparation
going
on
at
the
landing
on
the
river
where
is
master
going
i
knew
there
was
something
impending
but
i
said
to
the
maid
i
say
the
maid
did
not
dare
to
ask
me
any
more
questions
she
sighed
and
went
away
late
that
night
my
husband
came
to
me
i
have
to
visit
a
patient
in
the
country
said
he
i
shall
have
to
start
very
early
morning
and
i
may
have
to
be
away
for
two
or
three
days
i
got
up
from
my
bed
i
stood
before
him
and
cried
aloud
why
are
you
telling
me
lies
my
husband
stammered
out
what
what
lies
have
i
told
you
i
said
you
are
going
to
get
married
he
remained
silent
for
some
moments
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
then
i
broke
the
silence
answer
me
i
cried
say
yes
he
answered
yes
like
a
feeble
echo
i
shouted
out
with
a
loud
voice
no
i
shall
never
allow
you
i
shall
save
you
from
this
great
disaster
this
dreadful
sin
if
i
fail
in
this
then
why
am
i
your
wife
and
why
did
i
ever
worship
my
god
the
room
remained
still
as
a
stone
i
dropped
on
the
floor
and
clung
to
my
husband
knees
what
have
i
done
i
asked
where
have
i
been
lacking
tell
me
truly
why
do
you
want
another
wife
my
husband
said
slowly
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
afraid
of
you
your
blindness
has
enclosed
you
in
its
fortress
and
i
have
now
no
entrance
to
me
you
are
no
longer
a
woman
you
are
awful
as
my
god
i
can
not
live
my
every
day
life
with
you
i
want
a
woman
just
an
ordinary
woman
whom
i
can
be
free
to
chide
and
coax
and
pet
and
scold
oh
tear
open
my
heart
and
see
what
am
i
else
but
that
just
an
ordinary
woman
i
am
the
same
girl
that
i
was
when
i
was
newly
wed
a
girl
with
all
her
need
to
believe
to
confide
to
worship
i
do
not
recollect
exactly
the
words
that
i
uttered
i
only
remember
that
i
said
if
i
be
a
true
wife
then
may
god
be
my
witness
you
shall
never
do
this
wicked
deed
you
shall
never
break
your
oath
before
you
commit
such
sacrilege
either
i
shall
become
a
widow
or
hemangini
shall
die
then
i
fell
down
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
when
i
came
to
myself
it
was
still
dark
the
birds
were
silent
my
husband
had
gone
all
that
day
i
sat
at
my
worship
in
the
sanctuary
at
the
household
shrine
in
the
evening
a
fierce
storm
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
rain
swept
down
upon
the
house
and
shook
it
as
i
crouched
before
the
shrine
i
did
not
ask
my
god
to
save
my
husband
from
the
storm
though
he
must
have
been
at
that
time
in
peril
on
the
river
i
prayed
that
whatever
might
happen
to
me
my
husband
might
be
saved
from
this
great
sin
night
passed
the
whole
of
the
next
day
i
kept
my
seat
at
worship
when
it
was
evening
there
was
the
noise
of
shaking
and
beating
at
the
door
when
the
door
was
broken
open
they
found
me
lying
unconscious
on
the
ground
and
carried
me
to
my
room
when
i
came
to
myself
at
last
i
heard
some
one
whispering
in
my
ear
sister
i
found
that
i
was
lying
in
my
room
with
my
head
on
hemangini
lap
when
my
head
moved
i
heard
her
dress
rustle
it
was
the
sound
of
bridal
silk
o
my
god
my
god
my
prayer
has
gone
unheeded
my
husband
has
fallen
hemangini
bent
her
head
low
and
said
in
a
sweet
whisper
sister
dearest
i
have
come
to
ask
your
blessing
on
our
marriage
at
first
my
whole
body
stiffened
like
the
trunk
of
a
tree
that
has
been
struck
by
lightning
then
i
sat
up
and
said
painfully
forcing
myself
to
speak
the
words
why
should
i
not
bless
you
you
have
done
no
wrong
hemangini
laughed
her
merry
laugh
wrong
said
she
when
you
married
it
was
right
and
when
i
marry
you
call
it
wrong
i
tried
to
smile
in
answer
to
her
laughter
i
said
in
my
mind
my
prayer
is
not
the
final
thing
in
this
world
his
will
is
all
let
the
blows
descend
upon
my
head
but
may
they
leave
my
faith
and
hope
in
god
untouched
hemangini
bowed
to
me
and
touched
my
feet
may
you
be
happy
said
i
blessing
her
and
enjoy
unbroken
prosperity
hemangini
was
still
unsatisfied
dearest
sister
she
said
a
blessing
for
me
is
not
enough
you
must
make
our
happiness
complete
you
must
with
those
saintly
hands
of
yours
accept
into
your
home
my
husband
also
let
me
bring
him
to
you
i
said
yes
bring
him
to
me
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
a
familiar
footstep
and
the
question
kumo
how
are
you
i
started
up
and
bowed
to
the
ground
and
cried
dada
hemangini
burst
out
laughing
you
still
call
him
elder
brother
she
asked
what
nonsense
call
him
younger
brother
now
and
pull
his
ears
and
cease
him
for
he
has
married
me
your
younger
sister
then
i
understood
my
husband
had
been
saved
from
that
great
sin
he
had
not
fallen
i
knew
my
dada
had
determined
never
to
marry
and
since
my
mother
had
died
there
was
no
sacred
wish
of
hers
to
implore
him
to
wedlock
but
i
his
sister
by
my
sore
need
bad
brought
it
to
pass
he
had
married
for
my
sake
tears
of
joy
gushed
from
my
eyes
and
poured
down
my
cheeks
i
tried
but
i
could
not
stop
them
dada
slowly
passed
his
fingers
through
my
hair
hemangini
clung
to
me
and
went
on
laughing
i
was
lying
awake
in
my
bed
for
the
best
part
of
the
night
waiting
with
straining
anxiety
for
my
husband
return
i
could
not
imagine
how
he
would
bear
the
shock
of
shame
and
disappointment
when
it
was
long
past
the
hour
of
midnight
slowly
my
door
opened
i
sat
up
on
my
bed
and
listened
they
were
the
footsteps
of
my
husband
my
heart
began
to
beat
wildly
he
came
up
to
my
bed
held
my
band
in
his
your
dada
said
he
has
saved
me
from
destruction
i
was
being
dragged
down
and
down
by
a
moments
madness
an
infatuation
had
seized
me
from
which
i
seemed
unable
to
escape
god
alone
knows
what
a
load
i
was
carrying
on
that
day
when
i
entered
the
boat
the
storm
came
down
on
river
and
covered
the
sky
in
the
midst
of
all
fears
i
had
a
secret
wish
in
my
heart
to
be
drowned
and
so
disentangle
my
life
from
the
knot
which
i
had
tied
it
i
reached
mathurganj
there
i
heard
the
news
which
set
me
free
your
brother
had
married
hemangini
i
can
not
tell
you
with
what
joy
and
shame
i
heard
it
i
hastened
on
board
the
boat
again
in
that
moment
of
i
knew
that
i
could
have
no
happiness
except
with
you
you
are
a
goddess
i
laughed
and
cried
at
the
same
time
and
said
no
no
no
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
goddess
any
longer
i
am
simply
your
own
little
wife
i
am
an
ordinary
woman
dearest
he
replied
i
have
also
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
never
again
put
me
to
shame
by
calling
me
your
god
on
the
next
day
the
little
town
became
joyous
with
sound
of
conch
shells
but
nobody
made
any
reference
to
that
night
of
madness
when
all
was
so
nearly
lost
the
babus
of
nayanjore
i
once
upon
a
time
the
babus
of
nayanjore
were
famous
landholders
they
were
noted
for
their
princely
extravagance
they
would
tear
off
the
rough
border
of
their
dacca
muslin
because
it
rubbed
against
their
skin
they
could
spend
many
thousands
of
rupees
over
the
wedding
of
a
kitten
on
a
certain
grand
occasion
it
is
alleged
that
in
order
to
turn
night
into
day
they
lighted
numberless
lamps
and
showered
silver
threads
from
the
sky
to
imitate
sunlight
those
were
the
days
before
the
flood
the
flood
came
the
line
of
succession
among
these
babus
with
their
lordly
habits
could
not
continue
for
long
like
a
lamp
with
too
many
wicks
burning
the
oil
flared
away
quickly
and
the
light
went
out
kailas
babu
our
neighbour
is
the
last
relic
of
this
extinct
magnificence
before
he
grew
up
his
family
had
very
nearly
reached
its
lowest
ebb
when
his
father
died
there
was
one
dazzling
outburst
of
funeral
extravagance
and
then
insolvency
the
property
was
sold
to
liquidate
the
debt
what
little
ready
money
was
left
over
was
altogether
insufficient
to
keep
up
the
past
ancestral
splendours
kailas
babu
left
nayanjore
and
came
to
calcutta
his
son
did
not
remain
long
in
this
world
of
faded
glory
he
died
leaving
behind
him
an
only
daughter
in
calcutta
we
are
kailas
baba
neighbours
curiously
enough
our
own
family
history
is
just
the
opposite
to
his
my
father
got
his
money
by
his
own
exertions
and
prided
himself
on
never
spending
a
penny
more
than
was
needed
his
clothes
were
those
of
a
working
man
and
his
hands
also
he
never
had
any
inclination
to
earn
the
title
of
baba
by
extravagant
display
and
i
myself
his
only
son
owe
him
gratitude
for
that
he
gave
me
the
very
best
education
and
i
was
able
to
make
my
way
in
the
world
i
am
not
ashamed
of
the
fact
that
i
am
a
man
crisp
in
my
safe
are
dearer
to
me
than
a
long
pedigree
in
an
empty
family
chest
i
believe
this
was
why
i
disliked
seeing
kailas
baba
drawing
his
heavy
cheques
on
the
public
credit
from
the
bankrupt
bank
of
his
ancient
babu
reputation
i
used
to
fancy
that
he
looked
down
on
me
because
my
father
had
earned
money
with
his
own
hands
i
ought
to
have
noticed
that
no
one
showed
any
vexation
towards
kailas
babu
except
myself
indeed
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
an
old
man
who
did
less
harm
than
he
he
was
always
ready
with
his
kindly
little
acts
of
courtesy
in
times
of
sorrow
and
joy
he
would
join
in
all
the
ceremonies
and
religious
observances
of
his
neighbours
his
familiar
smile
would
greet
young
and
old
alike
his
politeness
in
asking
details
about
domestic
affairs
was
untiring
the
friends
who
met
him
in
the
street
were
perforce
ready
to
be
while
a
long
string
of
questions
of
this
kind
followed
one
another
from
his
lips
my
dear
friend
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
are
quite
well
how
is
shashi
and
dada
is
he
all
right
do
you
know
i
only
just
heard
that
madhu
son
has
got
fever
how
is
he
have
you
heard
and
hari
charan
babu
i
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
i
hope
he
is
not
what
the
matter
with
rakkhal
and
er
er
how
are
the
ladies
of
your
family
kailas
balm
was
spotlessly
neat
in
his
dress
on
all
occasions
though
his
supply
of
clothes
was
sorely
limited
every
day
he
used
to
air
his
shirts
and
vests
and
coats
and
trousers
carefully
and
put
them
out
in
the
sun
along
with
his
his
pillowcase
and
the
small
carpet
on
which
he
always
sat
after
airing
them
he
would
shake
them
and
brush
them
and
put
them
on
the
rock
his
little
bits
of
furniture
made
his
small
room
decent
and
hinted
that
there
was
more
in
reserve
if
needed
very
often
for
want
of
a
servant
he
would
shut
up
his
house
for
a
while
then
he
would
iron
out
his
shirts
and
linen
with
his
own
hands
and
do
other
little
menial
tasks
after
this
he
would
open
his
door
and
receive
his
friends
again
though
kailas
balm
as
i
have
said
had
lost
all
his
landed
property
he
had
still
same
family
heirlooms
left
there
was
a
silver
cruet
for
sprinkling
scented
water
a
filigree
box
for
a
small
gold
salver
a
costly
ancient
shawl
and
the
ceremonial
dress
and
ancestral
turban
these
he
had
rescued
with
the
greatest
difficulty
from
the
clutches
on
every
suitable
occasion
he
would
bring
them
out
in
state
and
thus
try
to
save
the
dignity
of
the
babus
of
nayanjore
at
heart
the
most
modest
of
men
in
his
daily
speech
he
regarded
it
as
a
sacred
duty
owed
to
his
rank
to
give
free
play
to
his
family
pride
his
friends
would
encourage
this
trait
in
his
character
with
kindly
and
it
gave
them
great
amusement
the
neighbourhood
soon
learnt
to
call
him
their
thakur
dada
grandfather
they
would
flock
to
his
house
and
sit
with
him
for
hours
together
to
prevent
his
incurring
any
expense
one
or
other
of
his
friends
would
bring
him
tobacco
and
say
thakur
dada
this
morning
some
tobacco
was
sent
to
me
from
gaya
do
take
it
and
see
how
you
like
it
thakur
dada
would
take
it
and
say
it
was
excellent
he
would
then
go
on
to
tell
of
a
certain
exquisite
tobacco
which
they
once
smoked
in
the
old
days
at
nayanjore
at
the
cost
of
a
guinea
an
ounce
i
wonder
he
used
to
say
i
wonder
if
any
one
would
like
to
try
it
now
i
have
some
left
and
can
get
it
at
once
every
one
knew
that
if
they
asked
for
it
then
somehow
or
other
the
key
of
the
cupboard
would
be
missing
or
else
ganesh
his
old
family
servant
had
put
it
away
somewhere
you
never
can
be
sure
he
would
add
where
things
go
to
when
servants
are
about
now
this
ganesh
of
mine
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
fool
he
is
but
i
have
the
heart
to
dismiss
him
ganesh
for
the
credit
of
the
family
was
quite
ready
to
bear
all
the
blame
without
a
word
one
of
the
company
usually
said
at
this
point
never
mind
thakur
dada
please
do
trouble
to
look
for
it
this
tobacco
we
smoking
will
do
quite
well
the
other
would
be
too
strong
then
thakur
dada
would
be
relieved
and
settle
down
again
and
the
talk
would
go
on
when
his
guests
got
up
to
go
away
thakur
dada
would
accompany
them
to
the
door
and
say
to
them
on
the
oh
by
the
way
when
are
you
all
coming
to
dine
with
me
one
or
other
of
us
would
answer
not
just
yet
thakur
dada
not
just
yet
we
fix
a
day
later
quite
right
he
would
answer
quite
right
we
had
much
better
wait
till
the
rains
come
it
too
hot
now
and
a
grand
rich
dinner
such
as
i
should
want
to
give
you
would
upset
us
in
weather
like
this
but
when
the
rains
did
come
every
one
careful
not
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
if
the
subject
was
brought
up
some
friend
would
suggest
gently
that
it
was
very
inconvenient
to
get
about
when
the
rains
were
so
severe
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
wait
till
they
were
over
and
so
the
game
went
on
his
poor
lodging
was
much
too
small
for
his
position
and
we
used
to
condole
with
him
about
it
his
friends
would
assure
him
they
quite
understood
his
difficulties
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
get
a
decent
house
in
calcutta
indeed
they
had
all
been
looking
out
for
years
for
a
house
to
suit
him
but
i
need
hardly
add
no
friend
had
been
foolish
enough
to
find
one
thakur
dada
used
to
say
after
a
long
sigh
of
resignation
well
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
this
house
after
all
then
he
would
add
with
a
genial
smile
but
you
know
i
could
never
bear
to
be
away
from
my
friends
i
must
be
near
you
that
really
compensates
for
everything
somehow
i
felt
all
this
very
deeply
indeed
i
suppose
the
real
reason
was
that
when
a
man
is
young
stupidity
appears
to
him
the
worst
of
crimes
kailas
babu
was
not
really
stupid
in
ordinary
business
matters
every
one
was
ready
to
consult
him
but
with
regard
to
nayanjore
his
utterances
were
certainly
void
of
common
sense
because
out
of
amused
affection
for
him
no
one
contradicted
his
impossible
statements
he
refused
to
keep
them
in
bounds
when
people
recounted
in
his
hearing
the
glorious
history
of
nayanjore
with
absurd
exaggerations
he
would
accept
all
they
said
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
never
doubted
even
in
his
dreams
that
any
one
could
disbelieve
it
ii
when
i
sit
down
and
try
to
analyse
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
i
had
towards
kailas
babu
i
see
that
there
was
a
still
deeper
reason
for
my
dislike
i
will
now
explain
though
i
am
the
son
of
a
rich
man
and
might
have
wasted
time
at
college
my
industry
was
such
that
i
took
my
degree
in
calcutta
university
when
quite
young
my
moral
character
was
flawless
in
addition
my
outward
appearance
was
so
handsome
that
if
i
were
to
call
myself
beautiful
it
might
be
thought
a
mark
of
but
could
not
be
considered
an
untruth
there
could
be
no
question
that
among
the
young
men
of
bengal
i
was
regarded
by
parents
generally
as
a
very
eligible
match
i
was
myself
quite
clear
on
the
point
and
had
determined
to
obtain
my
full
value
in
the
marriage
market
when
i
pictured
my
choice
i
had
before
my
eye
a
wealthy
father
only
daughter
extremely
beautiful
and
highly
educated
proposals
came
pouring
in
to
me
from
far
and
near
large
sums
in
cash
were
offered
i
weighed
these
offers
with
rigid
impartiality
in
the
delicate
scales
of
my
own
estimation
but
there
was
no
one
fit
to
be
my
partner
i
became
convinced
with
the
poet
bhabavuti
that
in
this
worlds
endless
time
and
boundless
space
one
may
be
born
at
last
to
match
my
sovereign
grace
but
in
this
puny
modern
age
and
this
contracted
space
of
modern
bengal
it
was
doubtful
if
the
peerless
creature
existed
as
yet
meanwhile
my
praises
were
sung
in
many
tunes
and
in
different
metres
by
designing
parents
whether
i
was
pleased
with
their
daughters
or
not
this
worship
which
they
offered
was
never
unpleasing
i
used
to
regard
it
as
my
proper
due
because
i
was
so
good
we
are
told
that
when
the
gods
withhold
their
boons
from
mortals
they
still
expect
their
worshippers
to
pay
them
fervent
honour
and
are
angry
if
it
is
withheld
i
had
that
divine
expectance
strongly
developed
in
myself
i
have
already
mentioned
that
thakur
dada
had
an
only
i
had
seen
her
many
times
but
had
never
mistaken
her
for
beautiful
no
thought
had
ever
entered
my
mind
that
she
would
be
a
possible
partner
for
myself
all
the
same
it
seemed
quite
certain
to
me
that
some
day
ox
other
kailas
babu
would
offer
her
with
all
due
worship
as
an
oblation
at
my
shrine
was
the
secret
of
my
was
thoroughly
annoyed
that
he
had
not
done
it
already
i
heard
he
had
told
his
friends
that
the
babus
of
nayanjore
never
craved
a
boon
even
if
the
girl
remained
unmarried
he
would
not
break
the
family
tradition
it
was
this
arrogance
of
his
that
made
me
angry
my
indignation
smouldered
for
some
time
but
i
remained
perfectly
silent
and
bore
it
with
the
utmost
patience
because
i
was
so
good
as
lightning
accompanies
thunder
so
in
my
character
a
flash
of
humour
was
mingled
with
the
mutterings
of
my
wrath
it
was
of
course
impossible
for
me
to
punish
the
old
man
merely
to
give
vent
to
my
rage
and
for
a
long
time
i
did
nothing
at
all
but
suddenly
one
day
such
an
amusing
plan
came
into
my
head
that
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
carrying
it
into
effect
i
have
already
said
that
many
of
kailas
babu
friends
used
to
flatter
the
old
man
vanity
to
the
full
one
who
was
a
retired
government
servant
had
told
him
that
whenever
he
saw
the
chota
lord
sahib
he
always
asked
for
the
latest
news
about
the
babus
of
nayanjore
and
the
chota
lard
had
been
heard
to
say
that
in
all
bengal
the
only
really
respectable
families
were
those
of
the
maharaja
of
burdwan
and
the
babus
of
nayanjore
when
this
monstrous
falsehood
was
told
to
kailas
balm
he
was
extremely
gratified
and
often
repeated
the
story
and
wherever
after
that
he
met
this
government
servant
in
company
he
would
ask
along
with
other
questions
oh
er
by
the
way
how
is
the
chota
lord
sahib
quite
well
did
you
say
ah
yes
i
am
so
delighted
to
hear
it
i
and
the
dear
mem
sahib
is
she
quite
well
too
ah
yes
and
the
little
they
quite
well
also
ah
yes
i
that
very
goad
news
be
sure
and
give
them
my
compliments
when
you
see
them
kailas
balm
would
constantly
express
his
intention
of
going
some
day
and
paying
a
visit
to
the
sahib
but
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
many
chota
lords
and
burro
lords
also
would
come
and
go
and
much
water
would
pass
down
the
hoogly
before
the
family
coach
of
nayanjore
would
be
furnished
up
to
pay
a
visit
to
government
house
one
day
i
took
kailas
babu
aside
and
told
him
in
a
whisper
thakur
dada
i
was
at
the
levee
yesterday
and
the
chota
lord
happened
to
mention
the
babes
of
nayanjore
i
told
him
that
kailas
balm
had
come
to
town
do
you
know
he
was
terribly
hurt
because
you
had
called
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
put
etiquette
on
one
side
and
pay
you
a
private
visit
himself
this
very
afternoon
anybody
else
could
have
seen
through
this
plot
of
mine
in
a
moment
and
if
it
had
been
directed
against
another
person
kailas
balm
would
have
understood
the
joke
but
after
all
he
had
heard
from
his
friend
the
government
servant
and
after
all
his
own
exaggerations
a
visit
from
the
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
he
became
highly
nervous
and
excited
at
my
news
each
detail
of
the
coming
visit
exercised
him
greatly
most
of
all
his
own
ignorance
of
english
how
on
earth
was
that
difficulty
to
be
met
i
told
him
there
was
no
difficulty
at
all
it
was
aristocratic
not
to
know
english
and
besides
the
always
brought
an
interpreter
with
him
and
he
had
expressly
mentioned
that
this
visit
was
to
be
private
about
when
most
of
our
neighbours
are
at
work
and
the
rest
are
asleep
a
carriage
and
pair
stopped
before
the
lodging
of
kailas
babu
two
flunkeys
in
livery
came
up
the
stairs
and
announced
in
a
loud
voice
the
chota
lord
sahib
hoe
arrived
kailas
babu
was
ready
waiting
for
him
in
his
ceremonial
robes
and
ancestral
turban
and
ganesh
was
by
his
side
dressed
in
his
master
best
suit
of
clothes
for
the
occasion
when
the
chota
lord
sahib
was
announced
kailas
balm
ran
panting
and
puffing
and
trembling
to
the
door
and
led
in
a
friend
of
mine
in
disguise
with
repeated
salaams
bowing
low
at
each
step
and
walking
backward
as
best
he
could
he
had
his
old
family
shawl
spread
over
a
hard
wooden
chair
and
he
asked
the
lord
sahib
to
be
seated
he
then
made
a
high
flown
speech
in
urdu
the
ancient
court
language
of
the
sahibs
and
presented
on
the
golden
salver
a
string
of
gold
mohurs
the
last
relics
of
his
broken
fortune
the
old
family
servant
ganesh
with
an
expression
of
awe
bordering
on
terror
stood
behind
with
the
drenching
the
lord
sahib
touching
him
gingerly
from
time
to
time
with
the
from
the
filigree
box
kailas
babu
repeatedly
expressed
his
regret
at
not
being
able
to
receive
his
honour
bahadur
with
all
the
ancestral
magnificence
of
his
own
family
estate
at
nayanjore
there
he
could
have
welcomed
him
properly
with
due
ceremonial
but
in
calcutta
he
was
a
mere
stranger
and
fact
a
fish
out
of
water
my
friend
with
his
tall
silk
hat
on
very
gravely
nodded
i
need
hardly
say
that
according
to
english
custom
the
hat
ought
to
have
been
removed
inside
the
room
but
my
friend
did
not
dare
to
take
it
off
for
fear
of
detection
and
kailas
balm
and
his
old
servant
ganesh
were
sublimely
unconscious
of
the
breach
of
etiquette
after
a
ten
minutes
interview
which
consisted
chiefly
of
nodding
the
head
my
friend
rose
to
his
feet
to
depart
the
two
flunkeys
in
livery
as
had
been
planned
beforehand
carried
off
in
state
the
string
of
gold
mohurs
the
gold
salver
the
old
ancestral
shawl
the
silver
and
the
filigree
box
they
placed
them
ceremoniously
in
the
carriage
kailas
babu
regarded
this
as
the
usual
habit
of
chota
lard
sahibs
i
was
watching
all
the
while
from
the
next
room
my
sides
were
aching
with
suppressed
laughter
when
i
could
hold
myself
in
no
longer
i
rushed
into
a
further
room
suddenly
to
discover
in
a
corner
a
young
girl
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
when
she
saw
my
uproarious
laughter
she
stood
upright
in
passion
flashing
the
lightning
of
her
big
dark
eyes
in
mine
and
said
with
a
voice
tell
me
what
harm
has
my
grandfather
done
to
you
why
have
you
come
to
deceive
him
why
have
you
come
here
why
she
could
say
no
more
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
broke
into
sobs
my
laughter
vanished
in
a
moment
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
anything
but
a
supremely
funny
joke
in
this
act
of
mine
and
here
i
discovered
that
i
had
given
the
cruelest
pain
to
this
tenderest
little
heart
all
the
ugliness
of
my
cruelty
rose
up
to
condemn
me
i
slunk
out
of
the
room
in
silence
like
a
kicked
dog
hitherto
i
had
only
looked
upon
kusum
the
of
kailas
babu
as
a
somewhat
worthless
commodity
in
the
marriage
market
waiting
in
vain
to
attract
a
husband
but
now
i
found
with
a
shock
of
surprise
that
in
the
corner
of
that
room
a
human
heart
was
beating
the
whole
night
through
i
had
very
little
sleep
my
mind
was
in
a
tumult
on
the
next
day
very
early
in
the
morning
i
took
all
those
stolen
goods
back
to
kailas
babe
lodgings
wishing
to
hand
them
over
in
secret
to
the
servant
ganesh
i
waited
outside
the
door
and
not
finding
any
one
went
upstairs
to
kailas
babu
room
i
heard
from
the
passage
kusum
asking
her
grandfather
in
the
most
winning
voice
dada
dearest
do
tell
me
all
that
the
chota
lord
sahib
said
to
you
yesterday
do
leave
out
a
single
word
i
am
dying
to
hear
it
all
over
again
and
dada
needed
no
encouragement
his
face
beamed
over
with
pride
as
he
related
all
manner
of
praises
which
the
lard
sahib
had
been
good
enough
to
utter
concerning
the
ancient
families
of
nayanjore
the
girl
was
seated
before
him
looking
up
into
his
face
and
listening
with
rapt
attention
she
was
determined
out
of
love
for
the
old
man
to
play
her
part
to
the
full
my
heart
was
deeply
touched
and
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
stood
there
in
silence
in
the
passage
while
thakur
dada
finished
all
his
embellishments
of
the
chota
lord
sahib
wonderful
visit
when
he
left
the
room
at
last
i
took
the
stolen
goods
and
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
girl
and
came
away
without
a
word
later
in
the
day
i
called
again
to
see
kailas
balm
himself
according
to
our
ugly
modern
custom
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
making
no
greeting
at
all
to
this
old
man
when
i
came
into
the
room
but
on
this
day
i
made
a
low
bow
and
touched
his
feet
i
am
convinced
the
old
man
thought
that
the
coming
of
the
chota
lord
sahib
to
his
house
was
the
cause
of
my
new
politeness
he
was
highly
gratified
by
it
and
an
air
of
benign
severity
shone
from
his
eyes
his
friends
had
flocked
in
and
he
had
already
begun
to
tell
again
at
full
length
the
story
of
the
visit
with
still
further
adornments
of
a
most
fantastic
kind
the
interview
was
already
becoming
an
epic
both
in
quality
and
in
length
when
the
other
visitors
had
taken
their
leave
i
made
my
proposal
to
the
old
man
in
a
humble
manner
i
told
him
that
though
i
could
never
for
a
moment
hope
to
be
worthy
of
marriage
connection
with
such
an
illustrious
family
yet
etc
etc
when
i
made
clear
my
proposal
of
marriage
the
old
man
embraced
me
and
broke
out
in
a
tumult
of
joy
i
am
a
poor
man
and
could
never
have
expected
such
great
good
fortune
that
was
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
that
kailas
babu
confessed
to
being
poor
it
was
also
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
that
he
forgot
if
only
for
a
single
moment
the
ancestral
dignity
that
belongs
to
the
babus
of
nayanjore
living
or
dead
i
the
widow
in
the
house
of
saradasankar
the
ranihat
zemindar
had
no
kinsmen
of
her
father
family
one
after
another
all
had
died
nor
had
she
in
her
husband
family
any
one
she
could
call
her
own
neither
husband
nor
son
the
child
of
her
saradasankar
was
her
darling
far
a
long
time
after
his
birth
his
mother
had
been
very
ill
and
the
widow
his
aunt
kadambini
had
fostered
him
if
a
woman
fosters
another
child
her
love
for
him
is
all
the
stronger
because
she
has
no
claim
upon
claim
of
kinship
that
is
but
simply
the
claim
of
love
love
can
not
prove
its
claim
by
any
document
which
society
accepts
and
does
not
wish
to
prove
it
it
merely
worships
with
double
passion
its
life
uncertain
treasure
thus
all
the
widow
thwarted
love
went
out
to
wards
this
little
child
one
night
in
sraban
kadambini
died
suddenly
for
some
reason
her
heart
stopped
beating
everywhere
else
the
world
held
on
its
course
only
in
this
gentle
little
breast
suffering
with
love
the
watch
of
time
stood
still
for
ever
lest
they
should
be
harassed
by
the
poike
four
of
the
brahmin
servants
took
away
the
body
without
ceremony
to
be
burned
the
of
ranihat
was
very
far
from
the
village
there
was
a
hut
beside
a
tank
a
huge
banian
near
it
and
nothing
more
formerly
a
river
now
completely
dried
up
ran
through
the
ground
and
part
of
the
watercourse
had
been
dug
out
to
make
a
tank
for
the
performance
of
funeral
rites
the
people
considered
the
tank
as
part
of
the
river
and
reverenced
it
as
such
taking
the
body
into
the
hut
the
four
men
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
wood
the
time
seemed
so
long
that
two
of
the
four
grew
restless
and
went
to
see
why
it
did
not
come
nitai
and
gurucharan
being
gone
bidhu
and
banamali
remained
to
watch
over
the
body
it
was
a
dark
night
of
sraban
heavy
clouds
hung
in
a
starless
sky
the
two
men
sat
silent
in
the
dark
room
their
matches
and
lamp
were
useless
the
matches
were
damp
and
would
not
light
for
all
their
efforts
and
the
lantern
went
out
after
a
long
silence
one
said
brother
it
would
be
good
if
we
had
a
bowl
of
tobacco
in
our
hurry
we
brought
none
the
other
answered
i
can
run
and
bring
all
we
want
understanding
why
banarnali
wanted
to
go
from
fear
of
ghosts
the
being
considered
haunted
bidhu
said
i
daresay
meanwhile
i
suppose
i
am
to
sit
here
alone
conversation
ceased
again
five
minutes
seemed
like
an
hour
in
their
minds
they
cursed
the
two
who
had
gone
to
fetch
the
wood
and
they
began
to
suspect
that
they
sat
gossiping
in
some
pleasant
nook
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
except
the
incessant
noise
of
frogs
and
crickets
from
the
tank
then
suddenly
they
fancied
that
the
bed
shook
slightly
as
if
the
dead
body
had
turned
on
its
side
bidhu
and
banamali
trembled
and
began
muttering
ram
ram
a
deep
sigh
was
heard
in
the
room
in
a
moment
the
watchers
leapt
out
of
the
hut
and
raced
for
the
village
after
running
about
three
miles
they
met
their
colleagues
coming
back
with
a
lantern
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
had
gone
to
smoke
and
knew
nothing
about
the
wood
but
they
declared
that
a
tree
had
been
cut
down
and
that
when
it
was
split
up
it
would
be
brought
along
at
once
then
bidhu
and
banamali
told
them
what
had
happened
in
the
hut
nitai
and
gurucharan
scoffed
at
the
story
and
abused
bidhu
and
banamali
angrily
for
leaving
their
duty
without
delay
all
four
returned
to
the
hut
as
they
entered
they
saw
at
once
that
the
body
was
gone
nothing
but
an
empty
bed
remained
they
stared
at
one
another
could
a
jackal
have
taken
it
but
there
was
no
scrap
of
clothing
anywhere
going
outside
they
saw
that
on
the
mud
that
had
collected
at
the
door
of
the
but
there
were
a
woman
tiny
footprints
newly
made
saradasankar
was
no
fool
and
they
could
hardly
persuade
him
to
believe
in
this
ghost
story
so
after
much
discussion
the
four
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
say
that
the
body
had
been
burnt
towards
dawn
when
the
men
with
the
wood
arrived
they
were
told
that
owing
to
their
delay
the
work
had
been
done
without
them
there
had
been
some
wood
in
the
but
after
all
no
one
was
likely
to
question
this
since
a
dead
body
is
not
such
a
valuable
property
that
any
one
would
steal
it
ii
every
one
knows
that
even
when
there
is
no
sign
life
is
often
secretly
present
and
may
begin
again
in
an
apparently
dead
body
kadambini
was
not
dead
only
the
machine
of
her
life
had
for
some
reason
suddenly
stopped
when
consciousness
returned
she
saw
dense
darkness
on
all
sides
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
not
lying
in
her
usual
place
she
called
out
sister
but
no
answer
came
from
the
darkness
as
she
sat
up
she
remembered
her
the
sudden
pain
at
her
breast
the
beginning
of
a
choking
sensation
her
elder
was
warming
some
milk
for
the
child
when
kadambini
became
faint
and
fell
on
the
bed
saying
with
a
choking
voice
sister
bring
the
child
here
i
am
worried
after
that
everything
was
black
as
when
an
inkpot
is
upset
over
an
kadambini
memory
and
consciousness
all
the
letters
of
the
world
book
in
a
moment
became
formless
the
widow
could
not
remember
whether
the
child
in
the
sweet
voice
of
love
called
her
auntie
as
if
for
the
last
time
or
not
she
could
not
remember
whether
as
she
left
the
world
she
knew
for
death
endless
unknown
journey
she
had
received
a
parting
gift
of
affection
for
the
silent
land
at
first
i
fancy
she
thought
the
lonely
dark
place
was
the
house
of
yama
where
there
is
nothing
to
see
nothing
to
hear
nothing
to
do
only
an
eternal
watch
but
when
a
cold
damp
wind
drove
through
the
open
door
and
she
heard
the
croaking
of
frogs
she
remembered
vividly
and
in
a
moment
all
the
rains
of
her
short
life
and
could
feel
her
kinship
with
the
earth
then
came
a
flash
of
lightning
and
she
saw
the
tank
the
banian
the
great
plain
the
trees
she
remembered
how
at
full
moon
she
had
sometimes
come
to
bathe
in
this
tank
and
how
dreadful
death
had
seemed
when
she
saw
a
corpse
on
the
her
first
thought
was
to
return
home
but
then
she
reflected
i
am
dead
how
can
i
return
home
that
would
bring
disaster
on
them
i
have
left
the
kingdom
of
the
living
i
am
my
own
ghost
if
this
were
not
so
she
reasoned
how
could
she
have
got
out
of
saradasankar
zenana
and
come
to
this
distant
burningground
at
midnight
also
if
her
funeral
rites
had
not
been
finished
where
had
the
men
gone
who
should
burn
her
recalling
her
in
saradasankar
house
she
now
found
herself
alone
in
a
distant
deserted
dark
burning
ground
surely
she
was
no
member
of
earthly
society
surely
she
was
a
creature
of
horror
of
her
own
ghost
at
this
thought
all
the
bonds
were
snapped
which
bound
her
to
the
world
she
felt
that
she
had
marvellous
strength
endless
freedom
she
could
do
what
she
liked
go
where
she
pleased
mad
with
the
inspiration
of
this
new
idea
she
rushed
from
the
but
like
a
gust
of
wind
and
stood
upon
the
burning
ground
all
trace
of
shame
or
fear
had
left
her
but
as
she
walked
on
and
on
her
feet
grew
tired
her
body
weak
the
plain
stretched
on
endlessly
here
and
there
were
sometimes
she
found
herself
standing
in
water
at
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
she
heard
one
or
two
birds
cry
from
the
by
the
distant
houses
then
terror
seized
her
she
could
not
tell
in
what
new
relation
she
stood
to
the
earth
and
to
living
folk
so
long
as
she
had
been
on
the
plain
on
the
covered
by
the
dark
night
of
sraban
so
long
she
had
been
fearless
a
denizen
of
her
own
kingdom
by
daylight
the
homes
of
men
filled
her
with
fear
men
and
ghosts
dread
each
other
for
their
tribes
inhabit
different
banks
of
the
river
of
death
iii
her
clothes
were
clotted
in
the
mud
strange
thoughts
and
walking
by
night
had
given
her
the
aspect
of
a
madwoman
truly
her
apparition
was
such
that
folk
might
have
been
afraid
of
her
and
children
might
have
stoned
her
or
run
away
luckily
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
her
was
a
traveller
he
came
up
and
said
mother
you
look
a
respectable
woman
wherever
are
you
going
alone
and
in
this
guise
kadambini
unable
to
collect
her
thoughts
stared
at
him
in
silence
she
could
not
think
that
she
was
still
in
touch
with
the
world
that
she
looked
like
a
respectable
woman
that
a
traveller
was
asking
her
questions
again
the
min
said
come
mother
i
will
see
you
home
tell
me
where
you
live
kadambini
thought
to
return
to
her
house
would
be
absurd
and
she
had
no
father
house
then
she
remembered
the
friend
of
her
childhood
she
had
not
seen
jogmaya
since
the
days
of
her
youth
but
from
time
to
time
they
had
exchanged
letters
occasionally
there
had
been
quarrels
between
them
as
was
only
right
since
kadambini
wished
to
make
it
dear
that
her
love
for
jogmaya
was
unbounded
while
her
friend
complained
that
kadambini
did
not
return
a
love
equal
to
her
own
they
were
both
sure
that
if
they
once
met
they
would
be
inseparable
kadambini
said
to
the
traveller
i
will
go
to
sripati
house
at
nisindapur
as
he
was
going
to
calcutta
nisindapur
though
not
near
was
on
his
way
so
he
took
kadambini
to
sripati
s
house
and
the
friends
met
again
at
first
they
did
not
recognise
one
another
but
gradually
each
recognised
the
features
of
the
other
childhood
what
luck
said
jogmaya
i
never
dreamt
that
i
should
see
you
again
but
how
hate
you
come
here
sister
your
folk
surely
did
let
you
go
kadambini
remained
silent
and
at
last
said
sister
do
not
ask
about
my
give
me
a
corner
and
treat
me
as
a
servant
i
will
do
your
work
what
cried
jogmaya
keep
you
like
a
servant
why
you
are
my
closest
friend
you
are
my
and
so
on
and
so
on
just
then
sripati
came
in
kadambini
stared
at
him
for
some
time
and
then
went
out
very
slowly
she
kept
her
head
uncovered
and
showed
not
the
slightest
modesty
or
respect
jogmaya
fearing
that
sripati
would
be
prejudiced
against
her
friend
began
an
elaborate
explanation
but
sripati
who
readily
agreed
to
anything
jogmaya
said
cut
short
her
story
and
left
his
wife
uneasy
in
her
mind
kadambini
had
come
but
she
was
not
at
one
with
her
friend
death
was
between
them
she
could
feel
no
intimacy
for
others
so
long
as
her
existence
perplexed
her
and
consciousness
remained
kadambini
would
look
at
jogmaya
and
brood
she
would
think
she
has
her
husband
and
her
work
she
lives
in
a
world
far
away
from
mine
she
shares
affection
and
duty
with
the
people
of
the
world
i
am
an
empty
shadow
she
is
among
the
living
i
am
in
eternity
jogmaya
also
was
uneasy
but
could
not
explain
why
women
do
not
love
mystery
because
though
uncertainty
may
be
transmuted
into
poetry
into
heroism
into
scholarship
it
can
not
be
turned
to
account
in
household
work
so
when
a
woman
can
not
understand
a
thing
she
either
destroys
and
forgets
it
or
she
shapes
it
anew
for
her
own
use
if
she
fails
to
deal
with
it
in
one
of
these
ways
she
loses
her
temper
with
it
the
greater
kadambini
abstraction
became
the
more
impatient
was
jogmaya
with
her
wondering
what
trouble
weighed
upon
her
mind
then
a
new
danger
arose
kadambini
was
afraid
of
herself
yet
she
could
not
flee
from
herself
those
who
fear
ghosts
fear
those
who
are
behind
them
wherever
they
can
not
see
there
is
fear
but
kadambini
chief
terror
lay
in
herself
for
she
dreaded
nothing
external
at
the
dead
of
night
when
alone
in
her
room
she
screamed
in
the
evening
when
she
saw
her
shadow
in
the
her
whole
body
shook
watching
her
fearfulness
the
rest
of
the
house
fell
into
a
sort
of
terror
the
servants
and
jogmaya
herself
began
to
see
ghosts
one
midnight
kadambini
came
out
from
her
bedroom
weeping
and
wailed
at
jogmaya
door
sister
sister
let
me
lie
at
your
feet
do
not
put
me
by
myself
jogmaya
anger
was
no
less
than
her
fear
she
would
have
liked
to
drive
kadambini
from
the
house
that
very
second
the
sripati
after
much
effort
succeeded
in
quieting
their
guest
and
put
her
in
the
next
room
next
day
sripati
was
unexpectedly
summoned
to
his
wife
apartments
she
began
to
upbraid
him
you
do
you
call
yourself
a
man
a
woman
runs
away
from
her
and
enters
your
house
a
month
passes
and
you
have
hinted
that
she
should
go
away
nor
have
i
heard
the
slightest
protest
from
you
i
should
cake
it
as
a
favour
if
you
would
explain
yourself
you
men
are
all
alike
men
as
a
race
have
a
natural
partiality
for
womankind
in
general
foe
which
women
themselves
hold
them
accountable
although
sripati
was
prepared
to
touch
jogmaya
body
and
swear
that
his
kind
feeling
towards
the
helpless
but
beautiful
kadambini
was
no
whit
greater
than
it
should
be
he
could
not
prove
it
by
his
behaviour
he
thought
that
her
people
must
have
treated
this
forlorn
widow
abominably
if
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
was
driven
to
take
refuge
with
him
as
she
had
neither
father
nor
mother
how
could
he
desert
her
so
saying
he
let
the
matter
drop
far
he
had
no
mind
to
distress
kadambini
by
asking
her
unpleasant
questions
his
wife
then
tried
other
means
of
her
sluggish
lord
until
at
last
he
saw
that
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
must
send
word
to
the
result
of
a
letter
he
thought
might
not
be
satisfactory
so
he
resolved
to
go
to
ranihat
and
act
on
what
he
learnt
so
sripati
went
and
jogmaya
on
her
part
said
to
kadambini
friend
it
hardly
seems
proper
for
you
to
stop
here
any
longer
what
will
people
say
kadambini
stared
solemnly
at
jogmaya
and
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
people
jogmaya
was
astounded
then
she
said
sharply
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
people
we
have
how
can
we
explain
the
detention
of
a
woman
belonging
to
another
house
kadambini
said
where
is
my
house
confound
it
thought
jogmaya
what
will
the
wretched
woman
say
next
very
slowly
kadambini
said
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
am
i
of
the
earth
you
laugh
weep
love
each
grips
and
holds
his
own
i
merely
look
you
are
human
i
a
shadow
i
can
not
understand
why
god
has
kept
me
in
this
world
of
yours
so
strange
were
her
look
and
speech
that
jogmaya
understood
something
of
her
drift
though
not
all
unable
either
to
dismiss
her
or
to
ask
her
any
more
questions
she
went
away
oppressed
with
thought
iv
it
was
nearly
ten
at
night
when
sripati
returned
from
ranihat
the
earth
was
drowned
in
torrents
of
rain
it
seemed
that
the
downpour
would
never
stop
that
the
night
would
never
end
jogmaya
asked
well
i
lots
to
say
presently
so
saying
sripati
changed
his
clothes
and
sat
down
to
supper
then
he
lay
dawn
for
a
smoke
his
mind
was
perplexed
his
wife
stilled
her
curiosity
for
a
long
time
then
she
came
to
his
couch
and
demanded
what
did
you
hear
that
you
have
certainly
made
a
mistake
jogmaya
was
nettled
women
never
make
mistakes
or
if
they
do
a
sensible
man
never
mentions
them
it
is
better
to
take
them
on
his
own
shoulders
jogmaya
snapped
may
i
be
permitted
to
hear
how
sripati
replied
the
woman
you
have
taken
into
your
house
is
not
your
kadambini
hearing
this
she
was
greatly
annoyed
especially
since
it
was
her
husband
who
said
it
what
i
do
know
my
own
friend
i
must
come
to
you
to
recognise
her
you
are
clever
indeed
sripati
explained
that
there
was
no
need
to
quarrel
about
his
cleverness
he
could
prove
what
he
said
there
was
no
doubt
that
jogmaya
kadambini
was
dead
jogmaya
replied
listen
you
certainly
made
some
huge
mistake
you
been
to
the
wrong
house
or
are
confused
as
to
what
you
have
heard
who
told
you
to
go
yourself
write
a
letter
and
everything
will
be
cleared
up
sripati
was
hurt
by
his
wife
lack
of
faith
in
his
executive
ability
he
produced
all
sorts
of
proof
without
result
midnight
found
them
still
asserting
and
contradicting
although
they
were
both
agreed
now
that
kadambini
should
be
got
out
of
the
house
although
sripati
believed
that
their
guest
had
deceived
his
wife
all
the
time
by
a
pretended
acquaintance
and
jogmaya
that
she
was
a
prostitute
yet
in
the
present
discussion
neither
would
acknowledge
defeat
by
degrees
their
voices
became
so
loud
that
they
forgot
that
kadambini
was
sleeping
in
the
next
room
the
one
said
we
in
a
nice
fix
i
tell
you
i
heard
it
with
my
own
ears
and
the
other
answered
angrily
what
do
i
care
about
that
i
can
see
with
my
own
eyes
surely
at
length
jogmaya
said
very
well
tell
me
when
kadambini
died
she
thought
that
if
she
could
find
a
discrepancy
between
the
day
of
death
and
the
date
of
some
letter
from
kadambini
she
could
prove
that
sripati
erred
he
told
her
the
date
of
kadambini
death
and
they
both
saw
that
it
fell
on
the
very
day
before
she
came
to
their
house
jogmaya
heart
trembled
even
sripati
was
not
unmoved
just
then
the
door
flew
open
a
damp
wind
swept
in
and
blew
the
lamp
out
the
darkness
rushed
after
it
and
filled
the
whole
house
kadambini
stood
in
the
room
it
was
nearly
one
the
rain
was
pelting
outside
kadambini
spoke
friend
i
am
your
kadambini
but
i
am
no
longer
living
i
am
dead
jogmaya
screamed
with
terror
sripati
could
speak
but
save
in
being
dead
i
have
done
you
no
wrong
if
i
have
no
place
among
the
living
i
have
none
among
the
dead
oh
whither
shall
i
go
crying
as
if
to
wake
the
sleeping
creator
in
the
dense
night
of
rain
she
asked
again
oh
whither
shall
i
go
so
saying
kadambini
left
her
friend
fainting
in
the
dark
house
and
went
out
into
the
world
seeking
her
own
place
v
it
is
hard
to
say
how
kadambini
reached
ranihat
at
first
she
showed
herself
to
no
one
but
spent
the
whole
day
in
a
ruined
temple
starving
when
the
untimely
afternoon
of
the
rains
was
and
people
huddled
into
their
houses
for
fear
of
the
impending
storm
then
kadambini
came
forth
her
heart
trembled
as
she
reached
her
house
and
when
drawing
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
she
entered
none
of
the
doorkeepers
objected
since
they
took
her
for
a
servant
and
the
rain
was
pouring
down
and
the
wind
howled
the
mistress
saradasankar
wife
was
playing
cards
with
her
widowed
sister
a
servant
was
in
the
kitchen
the
sick
child
was
sleeping
in
the
bedroom
kadambini
escaping
every
one
notice
entered
this
room
i
do
not
know
why
she
had
come
to
her
house
she
herself
did
not
know
she
felt
only
that
she
wanted
to
see
her
child
again
she
had
no
thought
where
to
go
next
or
what
to
do
in
the
lighted
room
she
saw
the
child
sleeping
his
fists
clenched
his
body
wasted
with
fever
at
sight
of
him
her
heart
became
parched
and
thirsty
if
only
she
could
press
that
tortured
body
to
her
breast
immediately
the
thought
followed
i
do
not
exist
who
would
see
it
his
mother
loves
company
loves
gossip
and
cards
all
the
time
that
she
left
me
in
charge
she
was
herself
free
from
anxiety
nor
was
she
troubled
about
him
in
the
least
who
will
look
after
him
now
as
i
did
the
child
turned
on
his
side
and
cried
auntie
give
me
water
her
darling
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
auntie
in
a
fever
of
excitement
she
poured
out
some
water
and
taking
him
to
her
breast
she
gave
it
him
as
long
as
he
was
asleep
the
child
felt
no
strangeness
in
taking
water
from
the
accustomed
hand
but
when
kadambini
satisfied
her
longing
and
kissed
him
and
began
rocking
him
asleep
again
he
awoke
and
embraced
her
did
you
die
auntie
he
asked
yes
darling
and
you
have
come
back
do
not
die
again
before
she
could
answer
disaster
overtook
her
one
of
the
maidservants
coming
in
with
a
cup
of
sago
dropped

and
fell
down
at
the
crash
the
mistress
left
her
cards
and
entered
the
room
she
stood
like
a
pillar
of
wood
unable
to
flee
or
speak
seeing
all
this
the
child
too
became
terrified
and
burst
out
weeping

he
said

kadambini
understood
that
she
had
not
died
the
old

old
things
the
same
child
the
same
love
all
returned
to
their
living
state
without
change
or
difference
between
her
and
them
in
her
friend
house
she
had
felt
that
her
childhood
companion
was
dead
in
her
child
room
she
knew
that
the
boy
auntie
was
not
dead
at
all
in
anguished
tones
she
said
sister

do
you
dread
me
see
i
am
as
you
knew
me
her
could
endure
no
longer
and
fell
into
a
faint
saradasankar
himself
entered
the
zenana
with
folded
hands
he
said
piteously
is
this
right
satis

my
only
son
why
do
you
show
yourself
to
him
are
we
not
your
own
kin
since

has
wasted
away
daily
his
fever
has
been
incessant
day
and
night
he
cries
auntie

these
bonds
of
maya
illusory
affection

a
soul
to
the

kadambini
could
bear
no

she
said
oh

how
can
i
persuade
you
that
i
am
not
dead
i

she
lifted
a
brass
pot
from
the
ground
and
dashed
it
against
her
forehead
the
blood
ran
from
her
brow

she
cried
i

saradasankar
stood
like
an

the

screamed
with
fear
the
two
fainting
women

still
then
kadambini
shouting
i

went
down
the
steps
to
the
zenana
well
and
plunged
in
from

storey
saradasankar
heard
the
splash
all
night
the

next

at

pouring

given
proof
that
she

when
nabendu
sekhar
was
wedded
to
arunlekha
the
god
of
marriage
smiled
from
behind
the
sacrificial
fire
alas
what
is
sport
for
the
gods
is
not
always
a
joke
to
us
poor
mortals
purnendu
sekhar
the
father
of
nabendu
was
a
man
well
known
amongst
the
english
officials
of
the
government
in
the
voyage
of
life
he
had
arrived
at
the
desert
shores
of
rai
bahadurship
by
diligently
plying
his
oats
of
salaams
he
held
in
reserve
enough
for
further
advancement
but
at
the
age
of
his
tender
gaze
still
fixed
on
the
misty
peals
of
he
suddenly
found
himself
transported
to
a
region
where
earthly
honours
and
decorations
are
naught
and
his
neck
found
everlasting
repose
on
the
funeral
pyre
according
to
modern
science
force
is
not
destroyed
but
is
merely
converted
to
another
form
and
applied
to
another
point
so
constant
handmaid
of
the
fickle
goddess
of
fortune
descended
from
the
shoulder
of
the
father
to
that
of
his
worthy
son
and
the
youthful
head
of
nabendu
sekhar
began
to
move
up
and
down
at
the
doors
of
englishmen
like
a
pumpkin
swayed
by
the
wind
the
traditions
of
the
family
into
which
he
had
married
were
entirely
different
its
eldest
son
pramathanath
had
won
for
himself
the
love
of
his
kinsfolk
and
the
regard
of
all
who
knew
him
his
kinsmen
and
his
neighbours
looked
up
to
him
as
their
ideal
in
all
things
pramathanath
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
and
in
addition
was
gifted
with
common
sense
but
he
held
no
high
official
position
he
had
no
handsome
salary
nor
did
he
exert
any
influence
with
his
pen
there
was
no
one
in
power
to
lend
him
a
helping
hand
because
he
desired
to
keep
away
from
englishmen
as
much
as
they
desired
to
keep
away
from
him
so
it
happened
that
he
shone
only
within
the
sphere
of
his
family
and
his
friends
and
excited
no
admiration
beyond
it
yet
this
pramathanath
had
once
sojourned
in
england
for
some
three
years
the
kindly
treatment
he
received
during
his
stay
there
overpowered
him
so
much
that
he
forgot
the
sorrow
and
the
humiliation
of
his
own
country
and
came
back
dressed
in
european
clothes
this
rather
grieved
his
brothers
and
his
sisters
at
first
but
after
a
few
days
they
began
to
think
that
european
clothes
suited
nobody
better
and
gradually
they
came
to
share
his
pride
and
dignity
on
his
return
from
england
pramathanath
resolved
that
he
would
show
the
world
how
to
associate
with
on
terms
of
equality
those
of
our
countrymen
who
think
that
no
such
association
is
possible
unless
we
bend
our
knees
to
them
showed
their
utter
lack
of
and
were
also
unjust
to
the
thought
pramathanath
he
brought
with
him
letters
of
introduction
from
many
distinguished
englishmen
at
home
and
these
gave
him
some
recognition
in
society
he
and
his
wife
occasionally
enjoyed
english
hospitality
at
tea
dinner
sports
and
other
entertainments
such
good
luck
intoxicated
him
and
began
to
produce
a
tingling
sensation
in
every
vein
of
his
body
about
this
time
at
the
opening
of
a
new
railway
line
many
of
the
town
proud
recipients
of
official
favour
were
invited
by
the
to
take
the
first
trip
pramathanath
was
among
them
on
the
return
journey
a
european
sergeant
of
the
police
expelled
some
indian
gentlemen
from
a
with
great
insolence
pramathanath
dressed
in
his
european
clothes
was
there
he
too
was
getting
out
when
the
sergeant
said
you
need
move
sir
keep
your
seat
please
at
first
pramathanath
felt
flattered
at
the
special
respect
thus
shown
to
him
when
however
the
train
went
on
the
dull
rays
of
the
setting
sun
at
the
west
of
the
fields
now
ploughed
up
and
stripped
of
green
seemed
in
his
eyes
to
spread
a
glow
of
shame
over
the
whole
country
sitting
near
the
window
of
his
lonely
compartment
he
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
eyes
of
his
motherland
hidden
behind
the
trees
as
pramathanath
sat
there
lost
in
reverie
burning
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
and
his
heart
burst
with
indignation
he
now
remembered
the
story
of
a
donkey
who
was
drawing
the
chariot
of
an
idol
along
the
street
the
wayfarers
bowed
down
to
the
idol
and
touched
the
dusty
ground
with
their
foreheads
the
foolish
donkey
imagined
that
all
this
reverence
was
being
shown
to
him
the
only
difference
said
pramathanath
to
himself
between
the
donkey
and
myself
is
this
i
understand
that
the
respect
i
receive
is
not
given
to
me
but
to
the
burden
on
my
back
arriving
home
pramathanath
called
together
all
the
children
of
the
household
and
lighting
a
big
bonfire
threw
all
his
european
clothes
into
it
one
by
one
the
children
danced
round
and
round
it
and
the
higher
the
flames
shot
up
the
greater
was
their
merriment
after
that
pramathanath
gave
up
his
sip
of
tea
and
bits
of
toast
in
houses
and
once
again
sat
inaccessible
within
the
castle
of
his
house
while
his
insulted
friends
went
about
from
the
door
of
one
englishman
to
that
of
another
bending
their
turbaned
heads
as
before
by
an
irony
of
fate
poor
nabendu
sekhar
married
the
second
daughter
of
this
house
his
were
well
educated
and
handsome
nabendu
considered
he
had
made
a
lucky
bargain
but
he
lost
no
time
in
trying
to
impress
on
the
family
that
it
was
a
rare
bargain
on
their
side
also
as
if
by
mistake
he
would
often
hand
to
his
sundry
letters
that
his
late
father
had
received
from
europeans
and
when
the
cherry
lips
of
those
young
ladies
smiled
sarcastically
and
the
point
of
a
shining
dagger
peeped
out
of
its
sheath
of
red
velvet
the
unfortunate
man
saw
his
folly
and
regretted
it
labanyalekha
the
eldest
sister
surpassed
the
rest
in
beauty
and
cleverness
finding
an
auspicious
day
she
put
on
the
of
nabendu
bedroom
two
pairs
of
english
boots
daubed
with
vermilion
and
arranged
flowers
incense
and
a
couple
of
burning
candles
before
them
in
true
ceremonial
fashion
when
nabendu
came
in
the
two
stood
on
either
side
of
him
and
said
with
mock
solemnity
bow
down
to
your
gods
and
may
you
prosper
through
their
blessings
the
third
sister
kiranlekha
spent
many
days
in
embroidering
with
red
silk
one
hundred
common
english
names
such
as
jones
smith
brown
thomson
on
a
chadar
when
it
was
ready
she
presented
this
namavoli
a
namavoli
is
a
sheet
of
cloth
printed
all
over
with
the
names
of
hindu
gods
and
goddesses
and
worn
by
pious
hindus
when
engaged
in
devotional
exercises
to
nabendu
sekhar
with
great
ceremony
the
fourth
sasankalekha
of
tender
age
and
therefore
of
no
account
said
i
will
make
you
a
string
of
beads
brother
with
which
to
tell
the
names
of
your
sahibs
her
sisters
reproved
her
saying
run
away
you
saucy
girl
feelings
of
shame
and
irritation
assailed
by
turns
the
mind
of
nabendu
sekhar
still
he
could
not
forego
the
company
of
his
especially
as
the
eldest
one
was
beautiful
her
honey
was
no
less
than
her
gall
and
nabendu
mind
tasted
at
once
the
sweetness
of
the
one
and
the
bitterness
of
the
other
the
butterfly
with
its
bruised
wings
buzzes
round
the
flower
in
blind
fury
unable
to
depart
the
society
of
his
so
much
infatuated
him
that
at
last
nabendu
began
to
disavow
his
craving
for
european
favours
when
he
went
to
salaam
the
burra
sahib
he
used
to
pretend
that
he
was
going
to
listen
to
a
speech
by
surendranath
banerjea
when
he
went
to
the
railway
station
to
pay
respects
to
the
chota
sahib
returning
from
darjeeling
he
would
tell
his
that
he
expected
his
youngest
uncle
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
the
unhappy
man
placed
between
the
of
his
sahibs
and
his
the
however
secretly
vowed
that
they
would
not
rest
till
the
sahibs
had
been
put
to
rout
about
this
time
it
was
rumoured
that
nabendu
name
would
be
included
in
the
forthcoming
list
of
birthday
honours
and
that
he
would
mount
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
to
paradise
by
becoming
a
rai
bahadur
the
poor
fellow
had
not
the
courage
to
break
the
joyful
news
to
his
one
evening
however
when
the
autumn
moon
was
flooding
the
earth
with
its
mischievous
beams
nabendu
heart
was
so
full
that
he
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
and
he
told
his
wife
the
next
day
nabendu
betook
herself
to
her
eldest
sister
house
in
a
palanquin
and
in
a
voice
choked
with
tears
bewailed
her
lot
he
is
going
to
grow
a
tail
said
labanya
by
becoming
a
rai
bahadur
is
he
why
should
you
feel
so
very
humiliated
oh
no
sister
dear
replied
arunlekha
i
am
prepared
to
be
anything
but
not
a
the
fact
was
that
in
her
circle
of
acquaintances
there
was
one
bhutnath
babu
who
was
a
rai
bahadur
and
that
explained
her
intense
aversion
to
that
title
labanya
said
to
her
sister
in
soothing
tones
do
be
upset
about
it
dear
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
to
prevent
it
babu
nilratan
the
husband
of
labanya
was
a
pleader
at
buxar
when
the
autumn
was
over
nabendu
received
an
invitation
from
labanya
to
pay
them
a
visit
and
he
started
for
buxar
greatly
pleased
the
early
winter
of
the
western
province
endowed
labanyalekha
with
new
health
and
beauty
and
brought
a
glowing
colour
to
her
pale
cheeks
she
looked
like
the
kasa
reeds
on
a
clear
autumn
day
growing
by
the
lonely
bank
of
a
rivulet
to
nabendu
enchanted
eyes
she
appeared
like
a
malati
plant
in
full
blossom
showering
brilliant
with
the
morning
light
nabendu
had
never
felt
better
in
his
life
the
exhilaration
of
his
own
health
and
the
genial
company
of
his
pretty
made
him
think
himself
light
enough
to
tread
on
air
the
ganges
in
front
of
the
garden
seemed
to
him
to
be
flowing
ceaselessly
to
regions
unknown
as
though
it
gave
shape
to
his
own
wild
fantasies
as
he
returned
in
the
early
morning
from
his
walk
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
mellow
rays
of
the
winter
sun
gave
his
whole
frame
that
pleasing
sensation
of
warmth
which
lovers
feel
in
each
other
arms
coming
home
he
would
now
and
then
find
his
amusing
herself
by
cooking
some
dishes
he
would
offer
his
help
and
display
his
want
of
skill
and
ignorance
at
every
step
but
nabendu
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
anxious
to
improve
himself
by
practice
and
attention
on
the
contrary
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
rebukes
he
received
from
his
he
was
at
great
pains
to
prove
every
day
that
he
was
inefficient
and
helpless
as
a
babe
in
mixing
spices
handling
the
saucepan
and
regulating
the
heat
so
as
to
prevent
things
getting
he
was
duly
rewarded
with
pitiful
smiles
and
scoldings
in
the
middle
of
the
day
he
ate
a
great
deal
of
the
good
food
set
before
him
incited
by
his
keen
appetite
and
the
coaxing
of
his
later
on
he
would
sit
down
to
a
game
of
cards
at
which
he
betrayed
the
same
lack
of
ability
he
would
cheat
pry
into
his
adversary
hand
quarrel
but
never
did
he
win
a
single
rubber
and
worse
still
he
would
not
acknowledge
defeat
this
brought
him
abuse
every
day
and
still
he
remained
incorrigible
there
was
however
one
matter
in
which
his
reform
was
complete
for
the
time
at
least
he
had
forgotten
that
to
win
the
smiles
of
sahibs
was
the
final
goal
of
life
he
was
beginning
to
understand
how
happy
and
worthy
we
might
feel
by
winning
the
affection
and
esteem
of
those
near
and
dear
to
us
besides
nabendu
was
now
moving
in
a
new
atmosphere
labanya
husband
babu
nilratan
a
leader
of
the
bar
was
reproached
by
many
because
he
refused
to
pay
his
respects
to
european
officials
to
all
such
reproaches
nilratan
would
reply
no
thank
you
if
they
are
not
polite
enough
to
return
my
call
then
the
politeness
i
offer
them
is
a
loss
that
can
never
be
made
up
for
the
sands
of
the
desert
may
be
very
white
and
shiny
but
i
would
much
rather
sow
my
seeds
in
black
soil
where
i
can
expect
a
return
and
nabendu
began
to
adopt
similar
ideas
all
regardless
of
the
future
his
chance
of
rai
bahadurship
throve
on
the
soil
carefully
prepared
by
his
late
father
and
also
by
himself
in
days
gone
by
nor
was
any
fresh
watering
required
had
he
not
at
great
expense
laid
out
a
splendid
in
a
town
which
was
a
fashionable
resort
of
europeans
when
the
time
of
congress
drew
near
nilratan
received
a
request
from
to
collect
subscriptions
nabendu
free
from
anxiety
was
merrily
engaged
in
a
game
of
cards
with
his
when
nilratan
babu
came
upon
him
with
a
in
his
hand
and
said
your
signature
please
from
old
habit
nabendu
looked
horrified
labanya
assuming
an
air
of
great
concern
and
anxiety
said
never
do
that
it
would
ruin
your
racecourse
beyond
repair
nabendu
blurted
out
do
you
suppose
i
pass
sleepless
nights
through
fear
of
that
we
wo
publish
your
name
in
the
papers
said
nilratan
reassuringly
labanya
looking
grave
and
anxious
said
still
it
would
be
safe
things
spread
so
from
mouth
to
mouth
nabendu
replied
with
vehemence
my
name
would
suffer
by
appearing
in
the
newspapers
so
saying
he
snatched
the
subscription
list
from
nilratan
hand
and
signed
away
a
thousand
rupees
secretly
he
hoped
that
the
papers
would
not
publish
the
news
labanya
struck
her
forehead
with
her
palm
and
gasped
out
what
have
you
done
nothing
wrong
said
nabendu
boastfully
but
but
drawled
labanya
the
guard
sahib
of
sealdah
station
the
at
whiteaway
the
of
hart
these
gentlemen
might
be
angry
with
you
and
decline
to
come
to
your
poojah
dinner
to
drink
your
champagne
you
know
just
think
they
might
pat
you
on
the
back
when
you
meet
them
again
it
would
break
my
heart
nabendu
snapped
out
a
few
days
passed
one
morning
nabendu
was
sipping
his
tea
and
glancing
at
a
newspaper
suddenly
a
letter
signed
x
caught
his
eye
the
writer
thanked
him
profusely
for
his
donation
and
declared
that
the
increase
of
strength
the
congress
had
acquired
by
having
such
a
man
within
its
fold
was
inestimable
alas
father
purnendu
sekhar
was
it
to
increase
the
strength
of
the
congress
that
you
brought
this
wretch
into
the
world
put
the
cloud
of
misfortune
had
its
silver
lining
that
he
was
not
a
mere
cypher
was
clear
from
the
fact
that
the
community
on
the
one
side
and
the
congress
on
the
other
were
each
waiting
patiently
eager
to
hook
him
and
land
him
on
their
own
side
so
nabendu
beaming
with
pleasure
took
the
paper
to
his
and
showed
her
the
letter
looking
as
though
she
knew
nothing
about
it
labanya
exclaimed
in
surprise
oh
what
a
pity
everything
has
come
out
who
bore
you
such
oh
how
cruel
of
him
how
wicked
of
him
nabendu
laughed
out
saying
now
now
do
call
him
names
labanya
i
forgive
him
with
all
my
heart
and
bless
him
too
a
couple
of
days
after
this
an
paper
reached
nabendu
through
the
post
there
was
a
letter
in
it
signed
one
who
knows
and
contradicting
the
above
report
those
who
have
the
pleasure
of
babu
nabendu
sekhar
personal
acquaintance
the
writer
went
on
can
not
for
a
moment
believe
this
absurd
libel
to
be
true
for
him
to
turn
a
congresswalla
is
as
impossible
as
it
is
for
the
leopard
to
change
his
spots
he
is
a
man
of
genuine
worth
and
neither
a
disappointed
candidate
for
government
employ
nor
a
briefless
barrister
he
is
not
one
of
those
who
after
a
brief
sojourn
in
england
return
aping
our
dress
and
manners
audaciously
try
to
thrust
themselves
on
society
and
finally
go
back
in
dejection
so
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
why
balm
nabendu
sekhar
etc
ah
father
purnendu
sekhar
what
a
reputation
you
had
made
with
the
europeans
before
you
died
this
letter
also
was
paraded
before
his
for
did
it
not
assert
that
he
was
no
mean
contemptible
scallywag
but
a
man
of
real
worth
labanya
exclaimed
again
in
feigned
surprise
which
of
your
friends
wrote
it
now
oh
come
is
it
the
ticket
collector
or
the
hide
merchant
or
is
it
the
of
the
fort
you
ought
to
send
in
a
contradiction
i
think
said
nilratan
is
it
necessary
said
nabendu
loftily
must
i
contradict
every
little
thing
they
choose
to
say
against
me
labanya
filled
the
room
with
a
deluge
of
laughter
nabendu
felt
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
and
said
why
what
the
matter
she
went
on
laughing
unable
to
check
herself
and
her
youthful
slender
form
waved
to
and
fro
this
torrent
of
merriment
had
the
effect
of
overthrowing
nabendu
completely
and
he
said
in
pitiable
accents
do
you
imagine
that
i
am
afraid
to
contradict
it
oh
dear
no
said
labanya
i
was
thinking
that
you
have
yet
ceased
trying
to
save
that
of
yours
so
full
of
promise
while
there
is
life
there
is
hope
you
know
that
what
i
am
afraid
of
you
think
do
you
very
well
you
shall
see
said
nabendu
desperately
and
forthwith
sat
down
to
write
his
contradiction
when
he
had
finished
labanya
and
nilratan
read
it
through
and
said
it
is
strong
enough
we
must
give
it
them
pretty
hot
must
we
and
they
kindly
undertook
to
revise
the
composition
thus
it
ran
when
one
connected
to
us
by
ties
of
blood
turns
our
enemy
he
becomes
far
more
dangerous
than
any
outsider
to
the
government
of
india
the
haughty
are
worse
enemies
than
the
russians
or
the
frontier
pathans
themselves
they
are
the
impenetrable
barrier
forever
hindering
the
growth
of
any
bond
of
friendship
between
the
government
and
people
of
the
country
it
is
the
congress
which
has
opened
up
the
royal
road
to
a
better
understanding
between
the
rulers
and
the
ruled
and
the
papers
have
planted
themselves
like
thorns
across
the
whole
breadth
of
that
road
etc
nabendu
had
an
inward
fear
as
to
the
mischief
this
letter
might
do
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
elated
at
the
excellence
of
its
composition
which
he
fondly
imagined
to
be
his
own
it
was
duly
published
and
for
some
days
comments
replies
and
rejoinders
went
on
in
various
newspapers
and
the
air
was
full
of
proclaiming
the
fact
that
nabendu
had
joined
the
congress
and
the
amount
of
his
subscription
nabendu
now
grown
desperate
talked
as
though
he
was
a
patriot
of
the
fiercest
type
labanya
laughed
inwardly
and
said
to
herself
well
you
have
to
pass
through
the
ordeal
of
fire
yet
one
morning
when
nabendu
before
his
bath
had
finished
rubbing
oil
over
his
chest
and
was
trying
various
devices
to
reach
the
inaccessible
portions
of
his
back
the
bearer
brought
in
a
card
inscribed
with
the
name
of
the
district
magistrate
himself
good
heavens
what
would
he
do
he
could
not
possibly
go
and
receive
the
magistrate
sahib
thus
he
shook
and
twitched
like
a
ready
dressed
for
the
frying
pan
he
finished
his
bath
in
a
great
hurry
tugged
on
his
clothes
somehow
and
ran
breathlessly
to
the
outer
apartments
the
bearer
said
that
the
sahib
had
just
left
after
waiting
for
a
long
time
how
much
of
the
blame
for
concocting
this
drama
of
invented
incidents
may
be
set
down
to
labanya
and
how
much
to
the
bearer
is
a
nice
problem
for
ethical
mathematics
to
solve
nabendu
heart
was
convulsed
with
pain
within
his
breast
like
the
tail
of
a
lizard
just
cut
off
he
moped
like
an
owl
all
day
long
labanya
banished
all
traces
of
inward
merriment
from
her
face
and
kept
on
enquiring
in
anxious
tones
what
has
happened
to
you
you
are
not
ill
i
hope
nabendu
made
great
efforts
to
smile
and
find
a
humorous
reply
how
can
there
be
he
managed
to
say
any
illness
within
your
jurisdiction
since
you
yourself
are
the
goddess
of
health
but
the
smile
soon
flickered
out
his
thoughts
were
i
subscribed
to
the
congress
fund
to
begin
with
published
a
nasty
letter
in
a
newspaper
and
on
the
top
of
that
when
the
magistrate
sahib
himself
did
me
the
honour
to
call
on
me
i
kept
him
waiting
i
wonder
what
he
is
thinking
of
me
alas
father
purnendu
sekhar
by
an
irony
of
fate
i
am
made
to
appear
what
i
am
not
the
next
morning
nabendu
decked
himself
in
his
best
clothes
wore
his
watch
and
chain
and
put
a
big
turban
on
his
head
where
are
you
off
to
enquired
his
urgent
business
nabendu
replied
labanya
kept
quiet
arriving
at
the
magistrate
gate
he
took
out
his
you
can
not
see
him
now
said
the
orderly
peon
icily
nabendu
took
out
a
couple
of
rupees
from
his
pocket
the
peon
at
once
salaamed
him
and
said
there
are
five
of
us
sir
immediately
nabendu
pulled
out
a
note
and
handed
it
to
him
he
was
sent
for
by
the
magistrate
who
was
writing
in
his
and
bedroom
slippers
nabendu
salaamed
him
the
magistrate
pointed
to
a
chair
with
his
finger
and
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
paper
before
him
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
babu
fingering
his
nervously
nabendu
said
is
shaky
tones
yesterday
you
were
good
enough
to
call
at
my
place
sir
the
sahib
knitted
his
brows
and
lifting
just
one
eye
from
his
paper
said
i
called
at
your
place
babu
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
beg
your
pardon
sir
faltered
out
nabendu
there
has
been
a
mistake
some
confusion
and
wet
with
perspiration
he
tumbled
out
of
the
room
somehow
and
that
night
as
he
lay
tossing
on
his
bed
a
distant
voice
came
into
his
ear
with
a
recurring
persistency
babu
you
are
a
howling
idiot
on
his
way
home
nabendu
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
magistrate
denied
having
called
simply
because
he
was
highly
offended
so
he
explained
to
labanya
that
he
had
been
out
purchasing
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
the
words
than
chuprassis
wearing
the
collectorate
badge
made
their
appearance
and
after
salaaming
nabendu
stood
there
grinning
have
they
come
to
arrest
you
because
you
subscribed
to
the
congress
fund
whispered
labanya
with
a
smile
the
six
peons
displayed
a
dozen
rows
of
teeth
and
said
bakshish
from
a
side
room
nilratan
came
out
and
said
in
an
irritated
manner
bakshish
what
for
the
peons
grinning
as
before
answered
the
went
to
see
the
magistrate
so
we
have
come
for
bakshish
i
did
know
laughed
out
labanya
that
the
magistrate
was
selling
nowadays
coolness
was
the
special
feature
of
his
trade
before
nabendu
in
trying
to
reconcile
the
story
of
his
purchase
with
his
visit
to
the
magistrate
uttered
some
incoherent
words
which
nobody
could
make
sense
of
nilratan
spoke
to
the
peons
there
has
been
no
occasion
for
bakshish
you
sha
have
it
nabendu
said
feeling
very
small
oh
they
are
poor
men
the
harm
of
giving
them
something
and
he
took
out
a
currency
note
nilratan
snatched
it
way
from
nabendu
hand
remarking
there
are
poorer
men
in
the
world
i
will
give
it
to
them
for
you
nabendu
felt
greatly
distressed
that
he
was
not
able
to
appease
these
ghostly
retainers
of
the
angry
siva
when
the
peons
were
leaving
with
thunder
in
their
eyes
he
looked
at
them
languishingly
as
much
as
to
say
you
know
everything
gentlemen
it
is
not
my
fault
the
congress
was
to
be
held
at
calcutta
this
year
nilratan
went
down
thither
with
his
wife
to
attend
the
sittings
nabendu
accompanied
them
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
calcutta
the
congress
party
surrounded
nabendu
and
their
delight
and
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
they
cheered
him
honoured
him
and
extolled
him
up
to
the
skies
everybody
said
that
unless
leading
men
like
nabendu
devoted
themselves
to
the
cause
there
was
no
hope
for
the
country
nabendu
was
disposed
to
agree
with
them
and
emerged
out
of
the
chaos
of
mistake
and
confusion
as
a
leader
of
the
country
when
he
entered
the
congress
pavilion
on
the
first
day
everybody
stood
up
and
shouted
hip
hip
hurrah
in
a
loud
outlandish
voice
hearing
which
our
motherland
reddened
with
shame
to
the
root
of
her
ears
in
due
time
the
queen
birthday
came
and
nabendu
name
was
not
found
in
the
list
of
rai
bahadurs
he
received
an
invitation
from
labanya
for
that
evening
when
he
arrived
there
labanya
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
presented
him
with
a
robe
of
honour
and
with
her
own
hand
put
a
mark
of
red
sandal
paste
on
the
middle
of
his
forehead
each
of
the
other
sisters
threw
round
his
neck
a
garland
of
flowers
woven
by
herself
decked
in
a
pink
sari
and
dazzling
jewels
his
wife
arunlekha
was
waiting
in
a
side
room
her
face
lit
up
with
smiles
and
blushes
her
sisters
rushed
to
her
and
placing
another
garland
in
her
hand
insisted
that
she
also
should
come
and
do
her
part
in
the
ceremony
but
she
would
not
listen
to
it
and
that
principal
garland
cherishing
a
desire
for
nabendu
neck
waited
patiently
for
the
still
secrecy
of
midnight
the
sisters
said
to
nabendu
we
crown
thee
king
such
honour
will
not
be
done
to
any
body
else
in
hindoostan
whether
nabendu
derived
any
consolation
from
this
he
alone
can
tell
but
we
greatly
doubt
it
we
believe
in
fact
that
he
will
become
a
rai
bahadur
before
he
has
done
and
the
englishman
and
the
pioneer
will
write
articles
lamenting
his
demise
at
the
proper
time
so
in
the
meanwhile
three
cheers
for
babu
purnendu
sekhar
hip
hip
hurrah
hip
hip
hurrah
hip
hip
hurrah
the
renunciation
i
it
was
a
night
of
full
moon
early
in
the
month
of
phalgun
the
youthful
spring
was
everywhere
sending
forth
its
breeze
laden
with
the
fragrance
of
the
melodious
notes
of
an
untiring
papiya
one
of
the
sweetest
songsters
in
bengal
writers
have
nicknamed
it
the
bird
which
is
a
sheer
libel
concealed
within
the
thick
foliage
of
an
old
lichi
tree
by
the
side
of
a
tank
penetrated
a
sleepless
bedroom
of
the
mukerji
family
there
hemanta
now
restlessly
twisted
a
lock
of
his
wife
hair
round
his
finger
now
beat
her
churl
against
her
wristlet
until
it
tinkled
now
pulled
at
the
chaplet
of
flowers
about
her
head
and
left
it
hanging
over
hex
face
his
mood
was
that
of
as
evening
breeze
which
played
about
a
favourite
flowering
shrub
gently
shaking
her
now
this
side
now
that
in
the
hope
of
rousing
her
to
animation
but
kusum
sat
motionless
looking
out
of
the
open
window
with
eyes
immersed
in
the
moonlit
depth
of
space
beyond
her
husband
caresses
were
lost
on
her
at
last
hemanta
clasped
both
the
hands
of
his
wife
and
shaking
them
gently
said
kusum
where
are
you
a
patient
search
through
a
big
telescope
would
reveal
you
only
as
a
small
seem
to
have
receded
so
far
away
o
do
come
closer
to
me
dear
see
how
beautiful
the
night
is
kusum
turned
her
eyes
from
the
void
of
space
towards
her
husband
and
said
slowly
i
know
a
mantra
a
set
of
magic
words
which
could
in
one
moment
shatter
this
spring
night
and
the
moon
into
pieces
if
you
do
laughed
hemanta
pray
do
utter
it
if
any
mantra
of
yours
could
bring
three
or
four
saturdays
during
the
week
and
prolong
the
nights
till
the
next
day
say
it
by
all
means
saying
this
he
tried
to
draw
his
wife
a
little
closer
to
him
kusum
freeing
herself
from
the
embrace
said
do
you
know
i
feel
a
longing
to
tell
you
what
i
promised
to
reveal
only
on
my
i
feel
that
i
could
endure
whatever
punishment
you
might
inflict
on
me
hemanta
was
on
the
point
of
making
a
jest
about
punishments
by
reciting
a
verse
from
jayadeva
when
the
sound
of
an
angry
pair
of
slippers
was
heard
approaching
rapidly
they
were
the
familiar
footsteps
of
his
father
haribar
mukerji
and
hemanta
not
knowing
what
it
meant
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
standing
outside
the
door
harihar
roared
out
hemanta
turn
your
wife
out
of
the
house
immediately
hemanta
looked
at
his
wife
and
detected
no
trace
of
surprise
in
her
features
she
merely
buried
her
face
within
the
palms
of
her
hands
and
with
all
the
strength
and
intensity
of
her
soul
wished
that
she
could
then
and
there
melt
into
nothingness
it
was
the
same
papiya
whose
song
floated
into
the
room
with
the
south
breeze
and
no
one
heard
it
endless
are
the
beauties
of
the
alas
how
easily
everything
is
twisted
out
of
shape
ii
returning
from
without
hemanta
asked
his
wife
is
it
true
it
is
replied
kusum
why
did
you
tell
me
long
ago
i
did
try
many
a
time
and
i
always
failed
i
am
a
wretched
woman
then
tell
me
everything
now
kusum
gravely
told
her
story
in
a
firm
unshaken
voice
she
waded
barefooted
through
fire
as
it
were
with
slow
unflinching
steps
and
nobody
knew
how
much
she
was
scorched
having
heard
her
to
the
end
hemanta
rose
and
walked
out
kusum
thought
that
her
husband
had
gone
never
to
return
to
her
again
it
did
not
strike
her
as
strange
she
took
it
as
naturally
as
any
other
incident
of
everyday
dry
and
apathetic
had
her
mind
become
during
the
last
few
moments
only
the
world
and
love
seemed
to
her
as
a
void
and
from
beginning
to
end
even
the
memory
of
the
protestations
of
love
which
her
husband
had
made
to
her
in
days
past
brought
to
her
lips
a
dry
hard
joyless
smile
like
a
sharp
cruel
knife
which
had
cut
through
her
heart
she
was
thinking
perhaps
that
the
love
which
seemed
to
fill
so
much
of
one
life
which
brought
in
its
train
such
fondness
and
depth
of
feeling
which
made
even
the
briefest
separation
so
exquisitely
painful
and
a
moment
union
so
intensely
sweet
which
seemed
boundless
in
its
extent
and
eternal
in
its
duration
the
cessation
of
which
could
not
be
imagined
even
in
births
to
come
that
this
was
that
love
so
feeble
was
its
support
no
sooner
does
the
priesthood
touch
it
than
your
eternal
love
crumbles
into
a
handful
of
dust
only
a
short
while
ago
hemanta
had
whispered
to
her
what
a
beautiful
night
the
same
night
was
not
yet
at
an
end
the
same
yapiya
was
still
warbling
the
same
south
breeze
still
blew
into
the
roam
making
the
shiver
the
same
moonlight
lay
on
the
bed
next
the
open
window
sleeping
like
a
beautiful
heroine
exhausted
with
gaiety
all
this
was
unreal
love
was
more
falsely
dissembling
than
she
herself
iii
the
next
morning
hemanta
fagged
after
a
sleepless
night
and
looking
like
one
distracted
called
at
the
house
of
peari
sankar
ghosal
what
news
my
son
peari
sankar
greeted
him
hemanta
flaring
up
like
a
big
fire
said
in
a
trembling
voice
you
have
defiled
our
caste
you
have
brought
destruction
upon
us
and
you
will
have
to
pay
for
it
he
could
say
no
more
he
felt
choked
and
you
have
preserved
my
caste
presented
my
ostracism
from
the
community
and
patted
me
on
the
back
affectionately
said
peari
sankar
with
a
slight
sarcastic
smile
hemanta
wished
that
his
could
reduce
peari
sankar
to
ashes
in
a
moment
but
his
rage
burnt
only
himself
peari
sankar
sat
before
him
unscathed
and
in
the
best
of
health
did
i
ever
do
you
any
harm
demanded
hemanta
in
a
broken
voice
let
me
ask
you
one
question
said
peari
sankar
my
daughter
my
only
harm
had
she
done
your
father
you
were
very
young
then
and
probably
never
heard
listen
then
now
do
you
excite
yourself
there
is
much
humour
in
what
i
am
going
to
relate
you
were
quite
small
when
my
nabakanta
ran
away
to
england
after
stealing
my
daughter
jewels
you
might
truly
remember
the
commotion
in
the
village
when
he
returned
as
a
barrister
five
years
later
or
perhaps
you
were
unaware
of
it
as
you
were
at
school
in
calcutta
at
the
time
your
father
arrogating
to
himself
the
headship
of
the
community
declared
that
if
i
sent
my
daughter
to
her
home
i
must
renounce
her
for
good
and
never
again
allow
her
to
cross
my
threshold
i
fell
at
your
father
feet
and
implored
him
saying
save
me
this
once
i
will
make
the
boy
swallow
and
go
through
the
prayaschittam
ceremony
do
take
him
back
into
caste
but
your
father
remained
obdurate
for
my
part
i
could
not
disown
my
only
child
and
bidding
to
my
village
and
my
kinsmen
i
betook
myself
to
calcutta
there
too
my
troubles
followed
me
when
i
had
made
every
arrangement
for
my
nephew
marriage
your
father
stirred
up
the
girl
people
and
they
broke
the
match
off
then
i
took
a
solemn
vow
that
if
there
was
a
drop
of
brahmin
blood
flowing
in
my
veins
i
would
avenge
myself
you
understand
the
business
to
some
extent
now
you
but
wait
a
little
longer
you
will
enjoy
it
when
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
it
is
interesting
when
you
were
attending
college
one
bipradas
chatterji
used
to
live
next
door
to
your
lodgings
the
poor
fellow
is
dead
now
in
his
house
lived
a
called
kusum
the
destitute
orphan
of
a
kayestha
gentleman
the
girl
was
very
pretty
and
the
old
brahmin
desired
to
shield
her
from
the
hungry
gaze
of
college
students
but
for
a
young
girl
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
her
old
guardian
was
not
at
all
a
difficult
task
she
often
went
to
the
top
of
the
roof
to
hang
her
washing
out
to
dry
and
i
believe
you
found
your
own
roof
best
suited
for
your
studies
whether
you
two
spoke
to
each
other
when
on
your
respective
roofs
i
can
not
tell
but
the
girl
behaviour
excited
suspicion
in
the
old
man
mind
she
made
frequent
mistakes
in
her
household
duties
and
like
parbati
the
wife
of
shiva
the
destroyer
engaged
in
her
devotions
began
gradually
to
renounce
food
and
sleep
some
evenings
she
would
burst
into
tears
in
the
presence
of
the
old
gentleman
without
any
apparent
reason
at
last
he
discovered
that
you
two
saw
each
other
from
the
roofs
pretty
frequently
and
that
you
even
went
the
length
of
absenting
yourself
from
college
to
sit
on
the
roof
at
with
a
book
in
your
hand
so
fond
had
you
grown
suddenly
of
solitary
study
bipradas
came
to
me
for
advice
and
told
me
everything
said
i
to
him
a
long
while
you
have
cherished
a
desire
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
to
benares
you
had
better
do
it
now
and
leave
the
girl
in
my
charge
i
will
take
care
of
her
so
he
went
i
lodged
the
girl
in
the
house
of
sripati
chatterji
passing
him
off
as
her
father
what
happened
next
is
known
to
you
i
feel
a
great
relief
having
told
you
everything
from
the
beginning
it
sounds
like
a
romance
does
it
i
think
of
turning
it
into
a
book
and
getting
it
printed
but
i
am
not
a
myself
they
say
my
nephew
has
some
aptitude
that
way
i
will
get
him
to
write
it
for
me
but
the
best
thing
would
be
if
you
would
collaborate
with
him
because
the
conclusion
of
the
story
is
not
known
to
me
so
well
without
paying
much
attention
to
the
concluding
remarks
of
peari
sankar
hemanta
asked
did
not
kusum
object
to
this
marriage
well
said
peari
sankar
it
is
very
difficult
to
guess
you
know
my
boy
how
women
minds
are
constituted
when
they
say
they
mean
during
the
first
few
days
after
her
removal
to
the
new
home
she
went
almost
crazy
at
not
seeing
you
you
too
seemed
to
have
discovered
her
new
address
somehow
as
you
used
to
lose
your
way
after
starting
for
college
and
loiter
about
in
front
of
sripati
house
your
eyes
did
not
appear
to
be
exactly
in
search
of
the
presidency
college
as
they
were
directed
towards
the
barred
windows
of
a
private
house
through
which
nothing
but
insects
and
the
hearts
of
young
men
could
obtain
access
i
felt
very
sorry
for
you
both
i
could
see
that
your
studies
were
being
seriously
interrupted
and
that
the
plight
of
the
girl
was
pitiable
also
one
day
i
called
kusum
to
me
and
said
to
me
my
daughter
i
am
an
old
man
and
you
need
feel
no
delicacy
in
my
presence
i
know
whom
you
desire
at
heart
the
young
man
condition
is
hopeless
too
i
wish
i
could
bring
about
your
union
at
this
kusum
suddenly
melted
into
tears
and
ran
away
on
several
evenings
after
that
i
visited
sripati
house
and
calling
kusum
to
me
discussed
with
her
matters
relating
to
you
and
so
i
succeeded
in
gradually
overcoming
her
shyness
at
last
when
i
said
that
i
would
try
to
bring
about
a
marriage
she
asked
me
can
it
be
mind
i
said
would
pass
you
off
as
a
brahmin
maiden
after
a
good
deal
of
argument
she
begged
me
to
find
out
whether
you
would
approve
of
it
nonsense
replied
i
boy
is
mad
as
it
were
what
the
use
of
disclosing
all
these
complications
to
him
let
the
ceremony
be
over
smoothly
and
then
well
that
ends
well
especially
as
there
is
not
the
slightest
risk
of
its
ever
leaking
out
why
go
out
of
the
way
to
make
a
fellow
miserable
for
life
i
do
not
know
whether
the
plan
had
kusum
assent
or
not
at
times
she
wept
and
at
other
times
she
remained
silent
if
i
said
us
drop
it
then
she
would
become
very
restless
when
things
were
in
this
state
i
sent
sripati
to
you
with
the
proposal
of
marriage
you
consented
without
a
moment
hesitation
everything
was
settled
shortly
before
the
day
fixed
kusum
became
so
obstinate
that
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
bringing
her
round
again
let
it
drop
uncle
she
said
to
me
constantly
do
you
mean
you
silly
child
i
rebuked
her
how
can
we
back
out
now
when
everything
has
been
settled
a
rumour
that
i
am
dead
she
implored
me
away
somewhere
would
happen
to
the
young
man
then
said
i
he
is
now
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
expecting
that
his
long
cherished
desire
would
be
fulfilled
and
you
want
me
to
send
him
the
news
of
your
death
the
result
would
be
that
i
should
have
to
bear
the
news
of
his
death
to
you
and
the
same
evening
your
death
would
be
reported
to
me
do
you
imagine
child
that
i
am
capable
of
committing
a
and
a
at
my
age
eventually
the
happy
marriage
was
celebrated
at
the
auspicious
moment
and
i
felt
relieved
of
a
burdensome
duty
which
i
owed
to
myself
what
happened
afterwards
you
know
best
could
you
stop
after
having
done
us
an
irreparable
injury
burst
out
hemanta
after
a
short
silence
why
have
you
told
the
secret
now
with
the
utmost
composure
peari
sankar
replied
when
i
saw
that
all
arrangements
had
been
made
for
the
wedding
of
your
sister
i
said
to
myself
i
have
fouled
the
caste
of
one
brahmin
but
that
was
only
from
a
sense
of
duty
here
another
brahmin
caste
is
imperilled
and
this
time
it
is
my
plain
duty
to
prevent
it
so
i
wrote
to
them
saying
that
i
was
in
a
position
to
prove
that
you
had
taken
the
daughter
of
a
sudra
to
wife
controlling
himself
with
a
gigantic
effort
hemanta
said
what
will
become
of
this
girl
whom
i
shall
abandon
now
would
you
give
her
food
and
shelter
i
have
done
what
was
mine
to
do
replied
peari
sankar
calmly
it
is
no
part
of
my
duty
to
look
after
the
discarded
wives
of
other
people
anybody
there
get
a
glass
of
cocoanut
milk
for
hemanta
babu
with
ice
in
it
and
some
pan
too
hemanta
rose
and
took
his
departure
without
waiting
for
this
luxurious
hospitality
iv
it
was
the
fifth
night
of
the
waning
of
the
moon
and
the
night
was
dark
no
birds
were
singing
the
lichi
tree
by
the
tank
looked
like
a
smudge
of
ink
on
a
background
a
shade
less
deep
the
south
wind
was
blindly
roaming
about
in
the
darkness
like
a
the
stars
in
the
sky
with
vigilant
unblinking
eyes
were
trying
to
penetrate
the
darkness
in
their
effort
to
fathom
some
profound
mystery
no
light
shone
in
the
bedroom
hemanta
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
next
the
open
window
gazing
at
the
darkness
in
front
of
him
kusum
lay
on
the
floor
clasping
her
husband
feet
with
both
her
arms
and
her
face
resting
on
them
time
stood
like
an
ocean
hushed
into
stillness
on
the
background
of
eternal
night
fate
seemed
to
have
painted
this
one
single
picture
for
all
time
annihilation
on
every
side
the
judge
in
the
centre
of
it
and
the
guilty
one
at
his
feet
the
sound
of
slippers
was
heard
again
approaching
the
door
harihar
mukerji
said
you
have
had
enough
time
i
ca
allow
you
more
turn
the
girl
out
of
the
house
kusum
as
she
heard
this
embraced
her
husband
feet
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
lifetime
covered
them
with
kisses
and
touching
her
forehead
to
them
reverentially
withdrew
herself
hemanta
rose
and
walking
to
the
door
said
father
i
wo
forsake
my
wife
what
roared
out
harihar
would
you
lose
your
caste
sir
i
do
care
for
caste
was
hemanta
calm
reply
then
you
too
i
renounce
the
cabuliwallah
the
fruitseller
from
cabul
my
five
years
old
daughter
mini
can
not
live
without
chattering
i
really
believe
that
in
all
her
life
she
has
not
wasted
a
minute
in
silence
her
mother
is
often
vexed
at
this
and
would
stop
her
prattle
but
i
would
not
to
see
mini
quiet
is
unnatural
and
i
can
not
bear
it
long
and
so
my
own
talk
with
her
is
always
lively
one
morning
for
instance
when
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
seventeenth
chapter
of
my
new
novel
my
little
mini
stole
into
the
room
and
putting
her
hand
into
mine
said
father
ramdayal
the
calls
a
crow
a
krow
he
does
know
anything
does
he
before
i
could
explain
to
her
the
differences
of
language
in
this
world
she
was
embarked
on
the
full
tide
of
another
subject
what
do
you
think
father
bhola
says
there
is
an
elephant
in
the
clouds
blowing
water
out
of
his
trunk
and
that
is
why
it
rains
and
then
darting
off
anew
while
i
sat
still
making
ready
some
reply
to
this
last
saying
father
what
relation
is
mother
to
you
my
dear
little
sister
in
the
law
i
murmured
involuntarily
to
myself
but
with
a
grave
face
contrived
to
answer
go
and
play
with
bhola
mini
i
am
busy
the
window
of
my
room
overlooks
the
road
the
child
had
seated
herself
at
my
feet
near
my
table
and
was
playing
softly
drumming
on
her
knees
i
was
hard
at
work
on
my
seventeenth
chapter
where
protrap
singh
the
hero
had
just
caught
kanchanlata
the
heroine
in
his
arms
and
was
about
to
escape
with
her
by
the
third
story
window
of
the
castle
when
all
of
a
sudden
mini
left
her
play
and
ran
to
the
window
crying
a
cabuliwallah
a
cabuliwallah
sure
enough
in
the
street
below
was
a
cabuliwallah
passing
slowly
along
he
wore
the
loose
soiled
clothing
of
his
people
with
a
tall
turban
there
was
a
bag
on
his
back
and
he
carried
boxes
of
grapes
in
his
hand
i
can
not
tell
what
were
my
daughter
feelings
at
the
sight
of
this
man
but
she
began
to
call
him
loudly
ah
i
thought
he
will
come
in
and
my
seventeenth
chapter
will
never
be
finished
at
which
exact
moment
the
cabuliwallah
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
child
when
she
saw
this
overcome
by
terror
she
fled
to
her
mother
protection
and
disappeared
she
had
a
blind
belief
that
inside
the
bag
which
the
big
man
carried
there
were
perhaps
two
or
three
other
children
like
herself
the
pedlar
meanwhile
entered
my
doorway
and
greeted
me
with
a
smiling
face
so
precarious
was
the
position
of
my
hero
and
my
heroine
that
my
first
impulse
was
to
stop
and
buy
something
since
the
man
had
been
called
i
made
some
small
purchases
and
a
conversation
began
about
abdurrahman
the
russians
she
english
and
the
frontier
policy
as
he
was
about
to
leave
he
asked
and
where
is
the
little
girl
sir
and
i
thinking
that
mini
must
get
rid
of
her
false
fear
had
her
brought
out
she
stood
by
my
chair
and
looked
at
the
cabuliwallah
and
his
bag
he
offered
her
nuts
and
raisins
but
she
would
not
be
tempted
and
only
clung
the
closer
to
me
with
all
her
doubts
increased
this
was
their
first
meeting
one
morning
however
not
many
days
later
as
i
was
leaving
the
house
i
was
startled
to
find
mini
seated
on
a
bench
near
the
door
laughing
and
talking
with
the
great
cabuliwallah
at
her
feet
in
all
her
life
it
appeared
my
small
daughter
had
never
found
so
patient
a
listener
save
her
father
and
already
the
corner
of
her
little
sari
was
stuffed
with
almonds
and
raisins
the
gift
of
her
visitor
why
did
you
give
her
those
i
said
and
taking
out
an
bit
i
handed
it
to
him
the
man
accepted
the
money
without
demur
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
alas
on
my
return
an
hour
later
i
found
the
unfortunate
coin
had
made
twice
its
own
worth
of
trouble
for
the
cabuliwallah
had
given
it
to
mini
and
her
mother
catching
sight
of
the
bright
round
object
had
pounced
on
the
child
with
where
did
you
get
that
bit
the
cabuliwallah
gave
it
me
said
mini
cheerfully
the
cabuliwallah
gave
it
you
cried
her
mother
much
shocked
oh
mini
how
could
you
take
it
from
him
i
entering
at
the
moment
saved
her
from
impending
disaster
and
proceeded
to
make
my
own
inquiries
it
was
not
the
first
or
second
time
i
found
that
the
two
had
met
the
cabuliwallah
had
overcome
the
child
first
terror
by
a
judicious
bribery
of
nuts
and
almonds
and
the
two
were
now
great
friends
they
had
many
quaint
jokes
which
afforded
them
much
amusement
seated
in
front
of
him
looking
down
on
his
gigantic
frame
in
all
her
tiny
dignity
mini
would
ripple
her
face
with
laughter
and
begin
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
what
have
you
got
in
your
bag
and
he
would
reply
in
the
nasal
accents
of
the
mountaineer
an
elephant
not
much
cause
for
merriment
perhaps
but
how
they
both
enjoyed
the
witticism
and
for
me
this
child
talk
with
a
man
had
always
in
it
something
strangely
fascinating
then
the
cabuliwallah
not
to
be
behindhand
would
take
his
turn
well
little
one
and
when
are
you
going
to
the
house
now
most
small
bengali
maidens
have
heard
long
ago
about
the
house
but
we
being
a
little
had
kept
these
things
from
our
child
and
mini
at
this
question
must
have
been
a
trifle
bewildered
but
she
would
not
show
it
and
with
ready
tact
replied
are
you
going
there
amongst
men
of
the
cabuliwallah
class
however
it
is
well
known
that
the
words
house
have
a
double
meaning
it
is
a
euphemism
for
jail
the
place
where
we
are
well
cared
for
at
no
expense
to
ourselves
in
this
sense
would
the
sturdy
pedlar
take
my
question
ah
he
would
say
shaking
his
fist
at
an
invisible
policeman
i
will
thrash
my
hearing
this
and
picturing
the
poor
discomfited
relative
mini
would
go
off
into
peals
of
laughter
in
which
her
formidable
friend
would
join
these
were
autumn
mornings
the
very
time
of
year
when
kings
of
old
went
forth
to
conquest
and
i
never
stirring
from
my
little
corner
in
calcutta
would
let
my
mind
wander
over
the
whole
world
at
the
very
name
of
another
country
my
heart
would
go
out
to
it
and
at
the
sight
of
a
foreigner
in
the
streets
i
would
fall
to
weaving
a
network
of
dreams
the
mountains
the
glens
and
the
forests
of
his
distant
home
with
his
cottage
in
its
setting
and
the
free
and
independent
life
of
wilds
perhaps
the
scenes
of
travel
conjure
themselves
up
before
me
and
pass
and
repass
in
my
imagination
all
the
more
vividly
because
i
lead
such
a
vegetable
existence
that
a
call
to
travel
would
fall
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
in
the
presence
of
this
cabuliwallah
i
was
immediately
transported
to
the
foot
of
arid
mountain
peaks
with
narrow
little
defiles
twisting
in
and
out
amongst
their
towering
heights
i
could
see
the
string
of
camels
bearing
the
merchandise
and
the
company
of
turbaned
merchants
carrying
some
of
their
queer
old
firearms
and
some
of
their
spears
journeying
downward
towards
the
plains
i
could
see
but
at
some
such
point
mini
mother
would
intervene
imploring
me
to
beware
of
that
man
mini
mother
is
unfortunately
a
very
timid
lady
whenever
she
hears
a
noise
in
the
street
or
sees
people
coming
towards
the
house
she
always
jumps
to
the
conclusion
that
they
are
either
thieves
or
drunkards
or
snakes
or
tigers
or
malaria
or
cockroaches
or
caterpillars
or
an
english
sailor
even
after
all
these
years
of
experience
she
is
not
able
to
overcome
her
terror
so
she
was
full
of
doubts
about
the
cabuliwallah
and
used
to
beg
me
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
him
i
tried
to
laugh
her
fear
gently
away
but
then
she
would
turn
round
on
me
seriously
and
ask
me
solemn
questions
were
children
never
kidnapped
was
it
then
not
true
that
there
was
slavery
in
cabul
was
it
so
very
absurd
that
this
big
man
should
be
able
to
carry
off
a
tiny
child
i
urged
that
though
not
impossible
it
was
highly
improbable
but
this
was
not
enough
and
her
dread
persisted
as
it
was
indefinite
however
it
did
not
seem
right
to
forbid
the
man
the
house
and
the
intimacy
went
on
unchecked
once
a
year
in
the
middle
of
january
rahmun
the
cabuliwallah
was
in
the
habit
of
returning
to
his
country
and
as
the
time
approached
he
would
be
very
busy
going
from
house
to
house
collecting
his
debts
this
year
however
he
could
always
find
time
to
come
and
see
mini
it
would
have
seemed
to
an
outsider
that
there
was
some
conspiracy
between
the
two
for
when
he
could
not
come
in
the
morning
he
would
appear
in
the
evening
even
to
me
it
was
a
little
startling
now
and
then
in
the
corner
of
a
dark
room
suddenly
to
surprise
this
tall
much
bebagged
man
but
when
mini
would
run
in
smiling
with
her
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
and
the
two
friends
so
far
apart
in
age
would
subside
into
their
old
laughter
and
their
old
jokes
i
felt
reassured
one
morning
a
few
days
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
i
was
correcting
my
proof
sheets
in
my
study
it
was
chilly
weather
through
the
window
the
rays
of
the
sun
touched
my
feet
and
the
slight
warmth
was
very
welcome
it
was
almost
eight
and
the
early
pedestrians
were
returning
home
with
their
heads
covered
all
at
once
i
heard
an
uproar
in
the
street
and
looking
out
saw
rahmun
being
led
away
bound
between
two
policemen
and
behind
them
a
crowd
of
curious
boys
there
were
on
the
clothes
of
the
cabuliwallah
and
one
of
the
policemen
carried
a
knife
hurrying
out
i
stopped
them
and
enquired
what
it
all
meant
partly
from
one
partly
from
another
i
gathered
that
a
certain
neighbour
had
owed
the
pedlar
something
for
a
rampuri
shawl
but
had
falsely
denied
having
bought
it
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
quarrel
rahmun
had
struck
him
now
in
the
heat
of
his
excitement
the
prisoner
began
calling
his
enemy
all
sorts
of
names
when
suddenly
in
a
verandah
of
my
house
appeared
my
little
mini
with
her
usual
exclamation
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
rahmun
face
lighted
up
as
he
turned
to
her
he
had
no
bag
under
his
arm
today
so
she
could
not
discuss
the
elephant
with
him
she
at
once
therefore
proceeded
to
the
next
question
are
you
going
to
the
house
rahmun
laughed
and
said
just
where
i
am
going
little
one
then
seeing
that
the
reply
did
not
amuse
the
child
he
held
up
his
fettered
hands
ali
he
said
i
would
have
thrashed
that
old
but
my
hands
are
bound
on
a
charge
of
murderous
assault
rahmun
was
sentenced
to
some
imprisonment
time
passed
away
and
he
was
not
remembered
the
accustomed
work
in
the
accustomed
place
was
ours
and
the
thought
of
the
mountaineer
spending
his
years
in
prison
seldom
or
never
occurred
to
us
even
my
mini
i
am
ashamed
to
say
forgot
her
old
friend
new
companions
filled
her
life
as
she
grew
older
she
spent
more
of
her
time
with
girls
so
much
time
indeed
did
she
spend
with
them
that
she
came
no
more
as
she
used
to
do
to
her
father
room
i
was
scarcely
on
speaking
terms
with
her
years
had
passed
away
it
was
once
more
autumn
and
we
had
made
arrangements
for
our
mini
marriage
it
was
to
take
place
during
the
puja
holidays
with
durga
returning
to
kailas
the
light
of
our
home
also
was
to
depart
to
her
husband
house
and
leave
her
father
in
the
shadow
the
morning
was
bright
after
the
rains
there
was
a
sense
of
ablution
in
the
air
and
the
looked
like
pure
gold
so
bright
were
they
that
they
gave
a
beautiful
radiance
even
to
the
sordid
brick
walls
of
our
calcutta
lanes
since
early
dawn
the
had
been
sounding
and
at
each
beat
my
own
heart
throbbed
the
wail
of
the
tune
bhairavi
seemed
to
intensify
my
pain
at
the
approaching
separation
my
mini
was
to
be
married
from
early
morning
noise
and
bustle
had
pervaded
the
house
in
the
courtyard
the
canopy
had
to
be
slung
on
its
bamboo
poles
the
chandeliers
with
their
tinkling
sound
must
be
hung
in
each
room
and
verandah
there
was
no
end
of
hurry
and
excitement
i
was
sitting
in
my
study
looking
through
the
accounts
when
some
one
entered
saluting
respectfully
and
stood
before
me
it
was
rahmun
the
cabuliwallah
at
first
i
did
not
recognise
him
he
had
no
bag
nor
the
long
hair
nor
the
same
vigour
that
he
used
to
have
but
he
smiled
and
i
knew
him
again
when
did
you
come
rahmun
i
asked
him
last
evening
he
said
i
was
released
from
jail
the
words
struck
harsh
upon
my
ears
i
had
never
before
talked
with
one
who
had
wounded
his
fellow
and
my
heart
shrank
within
itself
when
i
realised
this
for
i
felt
that
the
day
would
have
been
had
he
not
turned
up
there
are
ceremonies
going
on
i
said
and
i
am
busy
could
you
perhaps
come
another
day
at
once
he
turned
to
go
but
as
he
reached
the
door
he
hesitated
and
said
may
i
not
see
the
little
one
sir
for
a
moment
it
was
his
belief
that
mini
was
still
the
same
he
had
pictured
her
running
to
him
as
she
used
calling
o
cabuliwallah
cabuliwallah
he
had
imagined
too
that
they
would
laugh
and
talk
together
just
as
of
old
in
fact
in
memory
of
former
days
he
had
brought
carefully
wrapped
up
in
paper
a
few
almonds
and
raisins
and
grapes
obtained
somehow
from
a
countryman
for
his
own
little
fund
was
dispersed
i
said
again
there
is
a
ceremony
in
the
house
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
see
any
one
the
man
face
fell
he
looked
wistfully
at
me
for
a
moment
said
good
morning
and
went
out
i
felt
a
little
sorry
and
would
have
called
him
back
but
i
found
he
was
returning
of
his
own
accord
he
came
close
up
to
me
holding
out
his
offerings
and
said
i
brought
these
few
things
sir
for
the
little
one
will
you
give
them
to
her
i
took
them
and
was
going
to
pay
him
but
he
caught
my
hand
and
said
you
are
very
kind
sir
keep
me
in
your
recollection
do
not
offer
me
money
you
have
a
little
girl
i
too
have
one
like
her
in
my
own
home
i
think
of
her
and
bring
fruits
to
your
child
not
to
make
a
profit
for
myself
saying
this
he
put
his
hand
inside
his
big
loose
robe
and
brought
out
a
small
and
dirty
piece
of
paper
with
great
care
he
unfolded
this
and
smoothed
it
out
with
both
hands
on
my
table
it
bore
the
impression
of
a
little
band
not
a
photograph
not
a
drawing
the
impression
of
an
hand
laid
flat
on
the
paper
this
touch
of
his
own
little
daughter
had
been
always
on
his
heart
as
he
had
come
year
after
year
to
calcutta
to
sell
his
wares
in
the
streets
tears
came
to
my
eyes
i
forgot
that
he
was
a
poor
cabuli
while
i
was
but
no
what
was
i
more
than
he
he
also
was
a
father
that
impression
of
the
hand
of
his
little
parbati
in
her
distant
mountain
home
reminded
me
of
my
own
little
mini
i
sent
for
mini
immediately
from
the
inner
apartment
many
difficulties
were
raised
but
i
would
not
listen
clad
in
the
red
silk
of
her
with
the
sandal
paste
on
her
forehead
and
adorned
as
a
young
bride
mini
came
and
stood
bashfully
before
me
the
cabuliwallah
looked
a
little
staggered
at
the
apparition
he
could
not
revive
their
old
friendship
at
last
he
smiled
and
said
little
one
are
you
going
to
your
house
but
mini
now
understood
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
she
could
not
reply
to
him
as
of
old
she
flushed
up
at
the
question
and
stood
before
him
with
her
face
turned
down
i
remembered
the
day
when
the
cabuliwallah
and
my
mini
had
first
met
and
i
felt
sad
when
she
had
gone
rahmun
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
idea
had
suddenly
come
to
him
that
his
daughter
too
must
have
grown
in
this
long
time
and
that
he
would
have
to
make
friends
with
her
anew
assuredly
he
would
not
find
her
as
he
used
to
know
her
and
besides
what
might
not
have
happened
to
her
in
these
eight
years
the
sounded
and
the
mild
autumn
sun
streamed
round
us
but
rahmun
sat
in
the
little
calcutta
lane
and
saw
before
him
the
barren
mountains
of
afghanistan
i
took
out
a
and
gave
it
to
him
saying
go
back
to
your
own
daughter
rahmun
in
your
own
country
and
may
the
happiness
of
your
meeting
bring
good
fortune
to
my
child
having
made
this
present
i
had
to
curtail
some
of
the
festivities
i
could
not
have
the
electric
lights
i
had
intended
nor
the
military
band
and
the
ladies
of
the
house
were
despondent
at
it
but
to
me
the
wedding
feast
was
all
the
brighter
for
the
thought
that
in
a
distant
land
a
father
met
again
with
his
only
child
