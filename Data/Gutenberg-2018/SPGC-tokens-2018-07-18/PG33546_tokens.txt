chapter
i
mistress
and
agent
the
lady
of
thorpe
was
bored
these
details
as
to
leases
and
repairs
were
wearisome
the
phrases
and
verbiage
confused
her
she
felt
obliged
to
take
them
in
some
measure
for
granted
to
accept
without
question
the
calmly
offered
advice
of
the
man
who
stood
so
respectfully
at
the
right
hand
of
her
chair
this
agreement
with
philip
crooks
he
remarked
is
a
somewhat
important
document
with
your
permission
madam
i
will
read
it
to
you
she
signified
her
assent
and
leaned
wearily
back
in
her
chair
the
agent
began
to
read
his
mistress
watched
him
through
half
closed
eyes
his
voice
notwithstanding
its
strong
country
dialect
had
a
sort
of
intonation
he
read
earnestly
and
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
document
his
listener
made
no
attempt
to
arrive
at
the
sense
of
the
string
of
words
which
flowed
so
monotonously
from
his
lips
she
was
occupied
in
making
a
study
of
the
man
sturdy
and
neatly
dressed
in
country
clothes
with
a
somewhat
stock
with
trim
grey
and
a
mouth
which
reminded
her
somehow
of
a
foxhound
he
represented
to
her
in
his
clearly
cut
personality
the
changeless
side
of
life
the
side
of
life
which
she
associated
with
the
mighty
oaks
in
her
park
and
the
prehistoric
rocks
which
had
become
engrafted
with
the
soil
of
the
hills
beyond
as
she
saw
him
now
so
had
he
seemed
to
her
fifteen
years
ago
only
what
a
difference
a
volume
to
her
a
paragraph
to
him
she
had
gone
out
into
the
world
rich
intellectually
inquisitive
possessing
most
of
the
subtler
gifts
with
which
her
sex
is
endowed
and
wherever
the
passionate
current
of
life
had
flown
the
swiftest
she
had
been
there
a
leader
always
seeking
ever
to
satisfy
the
unquenchable
thirst
for
new
experiences
and
new
joys
she
had
passed
from
girlhood
to
womanhood
with
every
nerve
of
her
body
strained
to
catch
the
emotion
of
the
moment
always
her
fingers
had
been
tearing
at
the
cells
of
life
and
one
by
one
they
had
fallen
away
this
morning
in
the
bright
sunshine
which
flooded
the
great
room
she
felt
somehow
tired
tired
and
withered
her
maid
was
a
fool
the
two
hours
spent
at
her
toilette
had
been
wasted
she
felt
that
her
eyes
were
hollow
her
cheeks
pale
fifteen
years
and
the
man
had
not
changed
a
jot
she
doubted
whether
he
had
ever
passed
the
confines
of
her
estate
she
doubted
whether
he
had
even
had
the
desire
wind
and
sun
had
tanned
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
clear
his
slight
stoop
was
the
stoop
of
the
horseman
rather
than
of
age
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
satisfied
with
life
and
his
place
in
it
an
attitude
which
puzzled
her
no
one
of
her
world
was
like
that
was
it
some
inborn
gift
she
wondered
which
he
possessed
some
antidote
to
the
restlessness
which
he
carried
with
him
or
was
it
merely
lack
of
intelligence
he
finished
reading
and
folded
up
the
pages
to
find
her
regarding
him
still
with
that
air
of
careful
attention
with
which
she
had
listened
to
his
monotonous
flow
of
words
he
found
her
interest
surprising
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
invest
it
with
any
personal
element
the
agreement
upon
the
whole
he
remarked
is
i
believe
a
fair
one
you
are
perhaps
thinking
that
those
clauses
if
the
agreement
is
satisfactory
to
you
she
interrupted
i
will
confirm
it
he
bowed
slightly
and
glanced
through
the
pile
of
papers
upon
the
table
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
else
with
which
i
need
trouble
you
madam
he
remarked
she
nodded
imperiously
sit
down
for
a
moment
hurd
she
said
if
he
felt
any
surprise
he
did
not
show
it
he
drew
one
of
the
chairs
away
from
the
table
and
with
that
slight
air
of
deliberation
which
characterized
all
his
movements
seated
himself
he
was
in
no
way
disquieted
to
find
her
dark
tired
eyes
still
studying
him
how
old
are
you
mr
hurd
she
asked
i
am
madam
he
answered
her
eyebrows
were
gently
raised
to
her
it
seemed
incredible
she
thought
of
the
men
of
or
thereabouts
whom
she
knew
and
her
lips
parted
in
one
of
those
faint
rare
smiles
of
genuine
amusement
which
smoothed
out
all
the
lines
of
her
tired
face
visions
of
the
promenade
at
marienbad
and
carlsbad
the
kursaal
at
homburg
floated
before
her
she
saw
them
all
the
men
whom
she
knew
with
the
story
of
their
lives
written
so
plainly
in
their
faces
babbling
of
nerves
and
tonics
and
cures
the
newest
physician
the
latest
fad
defaulters
all
of
them
unwilling
to
pay
the
great
debt
seeking
always
a
way
out
here
at
least
this
man
scored
you
enjoy
good
health
she
remarked
i
never
have
anything
the
matter
with
me
he
answered
simply
i
suppose
he
added
as
though
by
an
afterthought
the
life
is
a
healthy
one
you
find
it
satisfying
she
asked
he
seemed
puzzled
i
have
never
attempted
anything
else
he
answered
it
seems
to
be
what
i
am
suited
for
she
attempted
to
abandon
the
of
questioner
to
give
a
more
natural
turn
to
the
conversation
it
is
always
she
remarked
such
a
relief
to
get
down
into
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
season
i
wonder
i
do
spend
more
time
here
i
daresay
one
could
amuse
oneself
she
added
carelessly
hurd
considered
for
a
few
moments
there
are
croquet
and
archery
and
tennis
in
the
neighbourhood
he
remarked
the
golf
course
on
the
park
hills
is
supposed
to
be
excellent
a
great
many
people
come
over
to
play
she
affected
to
be
considering
the
question
seriously
an
intimate
friend
would
not
have
been
deceived
by
her
air
of
attention
hurd
knew
nothing
of
this
he
on
his
part
however
was
capable
of
a
little
gentle
irony
it
might
amuse
you
he
remarked
to
make
a
tour
of
your
estate
there
are
some
of
the
outlying
portions
which
i
think
that
i
should
have
the
honour
of
showing
you
for
the
first
time
i
might
find
that
interesting
she
admitted
by
the
bye
hurd
what
sort
of
a
landlord
am
i
am
i
easy
or
do
i
exact
my
last
pound
of
flesh
one
likes
to
know
these
things
it
depends
upon
the
tenant
the
agent
answered
there
is
not
one
of
your
farms
upon
which
if
a
man
works
he
can
not
make
a
living
on
the
other
hand
there
is
not
one
of
them
on
which
a
man
can
make
a
living
unless
he
works
it
is
upon
this
principle
that
your
rents
have
been
adjusted
the
tenants
of
the
home
lands
have
been
most
carefully
chosen
and
thorpe
itself
is
spoken
of
everywhere
as
a
model
village
it
is
very
charming
to
look
at
its
mistress
admitted
the
flowers
and
thatched
roofs
are
so
picturesque
a
pastoral
idyll
my
guests
tell
me
the
people
one
sees
about
seem
contented
and
respectful
too
they
should
be
madam
hurd
answered
drily
the
villagers
have
had
a
good
many
privileges
from
your
family
for
generations
the
lady
inclined
her
head
thoughtfully
you
think
then
she
remarked
that
if
anything
should
happen
in
england
like
the
french
revolution
i
should
not
find
unexpected
thoughts
and
discontent
smouldering
amongst
them
you
believe
that
they
are
really
contented
hurd
knew
nothing
about
revolutions
and
he
was
utterly
unable
to
follow
the
trend
of
her
thoughts
if
they
were
not
madam
he
declared
they
would
deserve
to
be
in
the
workhouse
and
i
should
feel
it
my
duty
to
assist
them
in
getting
there
the
lady
of
thorpe
laughed
softly
to
herself
you
too
then
hurd
she
said
you
are
content
with
your
life
you
do
mind
my
being
personal
do
you
it
is
such
a
change
down
here
such
a
different
existence
and
i
like
to
understand
everything
upon
hurd
the
almost
pathetic
significance
of
those
last
words
was
wholly
wasted
they
were
words
of
a
language
which
he
could
not
comprehend
he
realized
only
their
direct
application
and
the
woman
to
him
seemed
like
a
child
if
i
were
not
content
madam
he
said
i
should
deserve
to
lose
my
place
i
should
deserve
to
lose
it
he
added
after
a
moment
pause
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
have
done
my
duty
faithfully
for
four
and
forty
years
she
smiled
upon
him
brilliantly
they
were
so
far
apart
that
she
feared
lest
she
might
have
offended
him
i
have
always
felt
myself
a
very
fortunate
woman
hurd
she
said
in
having
possessed
your
services
he
rose
as
though
about
to
go
it
was
her
whim
however
to
detain
him
you
lost
your
wife
some
years
ago
did
you
not
mr
hurd
she
began
tentatively
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
not
sure
of
her
ground
seven
years
back
madam
he
answered
with
immovable
face
she
was
unfortunately
never
a
strong
woman
and
your
son
she
asked
more
confidently
is
he
back
from
south
africa
a
year
ago
madam
he
answered
he
is
engaged
at
present
in
the
estate
office
he
knows
the
work
well
the
best
place
for
him
of
course
she
interrupted
we
ought
to
do
all
we
can
for
our
young
men
who
went
out
to
the
war
i
should
like
to
see
your
son
hurd
will
you
tell
him
to
come
up
some
day
certainly
madam
he
answered
perhaps
he
would
like
to
shoot
with
my
guests
on
thursday
she
suggested
graciously
hurd
did
not
seem
altogether
pleased
it
has
never
been
the
custom
madam
he
remarked
for
either
my
son
or
myself
to
be
associated
with
the
thorpe
shooting
parties
some
customs
she
remarked
pleasantly
are
well
changed
even
in
thorpe
we
shall
expect
him
hurd
mouth
reminded
her
for
a
moment
of
a
steel
trap
she
could
see
that
he
disapproved
but
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
way
he
began
to
tie
up
his
papers
and
she
watched
him
with
some
continuance
of
that
wave
of
interest
which
he
had
somehow
contrived
to
excite
in
her
the
signature
of
one
of
the
letters
which
he
was
methodically
folding
caught
her
attention
what
a
strange
name
she
remarked
victor
macheson
who
is
he
hurd
unfolded
the
letter
the
ghost
of
a
smile
flickered
upon
his
lips
a
preacher
apparently
he
answered
the
letter
is
one
asking
permission
to
give
a
series
of
what
he
terms
religious
lectures
in
harrison
large
barn
her
eyebrows
were
gently
raised
her
tone
was
one
of
genuine
surprise
what
in
thorpe
she
demanded
in
thorpe
hurd
acquiesced
she
took
the
letter
and
read
it
her
perplexity
was
in
no
manner
diminished
the
man
seems
in
earnest
she
remarked
he
must
either
be
a
stranger
to
this
part
of
the
country
or
an
extremely
impertinent
person
i
presume
hurd
that
nothing
has
been
going
on
in
the
place
with
which
i
am
unacquainted
certainly
not
madam
he
answered
there
has
been
no
drunkenness
she
remarked
the
young
people
have
i
presume
been
conducting
their
discreetly
the
lines
of
hurd
mouth
were
a
trifle
severe
one
could
imagine
that
he
found
her
modern
directness
of
speech
indelicate
there
have
been
no
scandals
of
any
sort
connected
with
the
village
madam
he
assured
her
to
the
best
of
my
belief
all
of
our
people
are
industrious
sober
and
pious
they
attend
church
regularly
as
you
know
we
have
not
a
or
a
dissenting
place
of
worship
in
the
village
the
man
must
be
a
fool
she
said
deliberately
you
did
not
of
course
give
him
permission
to
hold
these
services
certainly
not
the
agent
answered
i
refused
it
absolutely
the
lady
rose
and
hurd
understood
that
he
was
dismissed
you
will
tell
your
son
about
thursday
she
reminded
him
i
will
deliver
your
message
madam
he
answered
she
nodded
her
farewell
as
the
footman
opened
the
door
everything
seems
to
be
most
satisfactory
hurd
she
said
i
shall
probably
be
here
for
several
weeks
so
come
up
again
if
there
is
anything
you
want
me
to
sign
i
am
much
obliged
madam
the
agent
answered
he
left
the
place
by
a
side
entrance
and
rode
slowly
down
the
private
road
fringed
by
a
magnificent
row
of
elm
trees
to
the
village
the
latch
of
the
iron
gate
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
was
stiff
and
he
failed
to
open
it
with
his
hunting
crop
at
the
first
attempt
just
as
he
was
preparing
to
try
again
a
tall
young
man
dressed
in
sombre
black
came
swiftly
across
the
road
and
opened
the
gate
hurd
thanked
him
curtly
and
the
young
man
raised
his
hat
you
are
hurd
i
believe
he
remarked
i
was
going
to
call
upon
you
this
afternoon
the
little
man
upon
the
pony
frowned
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
questioner
my
name
is
hurd
sir
he
answered
stiffly
what
can
i
do
for
you
you
can
let
me
have
that
barn
for
my
services
the
other
answered
smiling
i
wrote
you
about
it
you
know
my
name
is
macheson
hurd
answer
was
briefly
spoken
and
did
not
invite
argument
i
have
mentioned
the
matter
to
miss
sir
she
agrees
with
me
that
your
proposed
ministrations
are
altogether
unneeded
in
this
neighbourhood
you
wo
let
me
use
the
barn
then
the
young
man
remarked
pleasantly
but
with
some
air
of
disappointment
hurd
gathered
up
the
reins
in
his
hand
certainly
not
sir
he
would
have
moved
on
but
his
questioner
stood
in
the
way
hurd
looked
at
him
from
underneath
his
shaggy
eyebrows
the
young
man
was
remarkably
young
his
smooth
beardless
face
was
the
face
of
a
boy
only
the
eyes
seemed
somehow
to
speak
of
graver
things
they
were
very
bright
indeed
and
they
did
not
falter
hurd
he
begged
do
let
me
ask
you
one
question
why
do
you
refuse
me
what
harm
can
i
possibly
do
by
talking
to
your
villagers
hurd
pointed
with
his
whip
up
and
down
the
country
lane
this
is
the
village
of
thorpe
sir
he
answered
there
are
no
poor
there
is
no
and
there
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
farthest
cottage
he
added
pointing
to
the
end
of
the
street
is
the
church
you
are
not
needed
here
that
is
the
plain
truth
the
young
man
looked
up
and
down
at
the
cottages
with
their
thatched
roofs
and
trim
appearance
at
the
neatly
cut
hedges
the
road
the
many
signs
of
prosperity
he
looked
at
the
little
grey
church
standing
in
its
ancient
walled
churchyard
where
the
road
divided
a
very
delightful
addition
to
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
place
he
looked
at
all
these
things
and
he
sighed
hurd
he
said
you
are
a
man
of
experience
you
know
very
well
that
material
and
spiritual
welfare
are
sometimes
things
very
far
apart
hurd
frowned
and
turned
his
pony
head
towards
home
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
sir
he
snapped
what
i
do
know
is
that
we
do
want
any
salvation
army
tricks
here
you
should
stay
in
the
cities
they
like
that
sort
of
thing
there
i
must
come
where
i
am
sent
hurd
the
young
man
answered
i
can
not
do
your
people
any
harm
i
only
want
to
deliver
my
message
and
go
hurd
wheeled
his
pony
round
i
submitted
your
letter
to
miss
he
said
she
agrees
with
me
that
your
ministrations
are
wholly
unnecessary
here
i
wish
you
good
evening
the
young
man
caught
for
a
moment
at
the
pony
rein
one
moment
sir
he
begged
you
do
not
object
to
my
appealing
to
miss
herself
a
grim
mirthless
smile
parted
the
agent
lips
by
no
means
he
answered
as
he
cantered
off
victor
macheson
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
retreating
figure
then
he
looked
across
the
park
to
where
through
the
great
elm
avenues
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
house
a
humorous
smile
suddenly
brightened
his
face
it
got
to
be
done
he
said
to
himself
here
goes
chapter
ii
the
hunter
and
his
quarry
the
mistress
of
thorpe
stooped
to
pat
a
black
pomeranian
which
had
rushed
out
to
meet
her
it
was
when
she
indulged
in
some
such
movement
that
one
realized
more
thoroughly
the
wonderful
grace
of
her
slim
supple
figure
she
who
hated
all
manner
of
exercise
had
the
ease
of
carriage
and
flexibility
of
one
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
athletic
pursuits
how
are
you
all
she
remarked
languidly
shocking
hostess
am
i
not
a
little
woman
turned
away
from
the
she
held
a
chocolate
éclair
in
one
hand
and
a
cup
of
russian
tea
in
the
other
her
eyes
were
very
dark
and
her
hair
very
yellow
and
both
were
perfectly
and
unexpectedly
natural
her
real
name
was
lady
margaret
penshore
but
she
was
known
to
her
intimates
and
to
the
mysterious
individuals
who
write
under
a
in
the
society
papers
as
lady
peggy
a
little
casual
perhaps
my
dear
wilhelmina
she
remarked
comes
from
your
association
with
royalty
i
suppose
try
one
of
your
own
caviare
sandwiches
if
you
want
anything
to
eat
they
ripping
wilhelmina
she
was
one
of
the
few
women
of
her
set
with
whose
christian
name
no
one
had
ever
attempted
to
take
any
liberties
approached
the
and
studied
its
burden
there
were
a
dozen
different
sorts
of
sandwiches
arranged
in
the
most
tempting
form
dishes
with
delicately
browned
simmering
gently
thick
cream
in
silver
jugs
tea
and
coffee
and
in
the
background
old
china
dishes
piled
with
freshly
gathered
strawberries
and
peaches
and
grapes
on
which
the
bloom
still
rested
on
a
smaller
table
were
flasks
of
liqueurs
and
a
spirit
decanter
anyhow
she
remarked
pouring
herself
out
some
tea
i
do
feed
you
people
well
and
as
to
being
casual
i
warned
you
that
i
never
put
in
an
appearance
before
five
a
man
in
the
background
long
and
a
man
whose
age
it
would
have
been
as
impossible
to
guess
as
his
character
opened
and
closed
his
watch
with
a
clink
twenty
minutes
past
he
remarked
to
be
exact
minutes
past
his
hostess
turned
and
regarded
him
contemplatively
how
painfully
precise
she
remarked
somehow
it
does
sound
convincing
though
your
watch
is
probably
like
your
morals
what
a
flattering
simile
he
murmured
flattering
it
presupposes
at
any
rate
their
existence
he
explained
it
is
years
since
i
was
reminded
of
them
wilhelmina
seated
herself
before
an
open
no
doubt
she
answered
you
see
i
knew
you
when
you
were
a
boy
seriously
she
continued
i
have
been
engaged
with
my
agent
for
the
last
a
most
interesting
person
i
can
assure
you
there
was
an
agreement
with
one
philip
crooks
concerning
a
farm
which
he
felt
compelled
to
read
to
me
every
word
of
it
come
along
and
cut
all
of
you
the
fourth
person
slim
the
typical
army
officer
and
country
house
habitué
came
over
to
the
table
followed
by
the
man
lady
peggy
also
turned
up
a
card
you
and
i
gilbert
wilhelmina
remarked
to
the
elder
man
here
luck
to
us
what
on
earth
is
that
you
are
drinking
absinthe
he
answered
calmly
i
have
been
trying
to
persuade
austin
to
join
me
but
it
seems
they
do
drink
absinthe
in
the
army
i
should
think
not
indeed
his
hostess
answered
and
you
my
partner
too
put
the
stuff
away
gilbert
deyes
raised
his
glass
and
looked
thoughtfully
into
its
opalescent
depths
ah
my
dear
lady
he
said
you
make
a
great
mistake
when
you
number
absinthe
amongst
the
ordinary
intoxicating
beverages
i
tell
you
that
the
man
who
invented
it
was
an
epicure
in
sensations
and
er
gastronomy
if
only
de
quincey
had
realized
the
possibility
of
absinthe
he
would
have
given
us
jewelled
prose
indeed
wilhelmina
yawned
bother
de
quincey
she
declared
it
your
bridge
i
thinking
of
dear
lady
you
need
have
no
anxiety
deyes
answered
reassuringly
one
does
not
trifle
with
one
livelihood
you
will
find
me
capable
of
the
most
daring
finesses
the
most
wonderful
coups
i
shall
not
revoke
i
shall
not
lead
out
of
the
wrong
hand
my
declarations
will
be
touched
with
genius
the
rubber
in
fact
is
already
won
vive
the
rubber
will
never
be
begun
if
you
go
on
talking
nonsense
much
longer
lady
peggy
declared
tapping
the
table
impatiently
i
believe
i
hear
the
motors
outside
we
shall
have
the
whole
crowd
here
directly
they
wo
find
their
way
here
their
hostess
assured
them
calmly
my
deal
i
believe
they
played
the
hand
in
silence
at
its
conclusion
wilhelmina
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
listened
you
were
right
peggy
she
said
they
are
all
in
the
hall
i
can
hear
your
brother
voice
lady
peggy
nodded
sounds
healthy
does
it
gilbert
deyes
leaned
across
to
the
side
table
and
helped
himself
to
a
cigarette
healthy
i
call
it
boisterous
he
declared
where
have
they
all
been
motoring
somewhere
wilhelmina
answered
they
none
of
them
have
any
idea
how
to
pass
the
time
away
until
the
first
run
sport
my
dear
hostess
deyes
remarked
is
the
one
thing
which
makes
life
in
a
country
house
almost
unendurable
wilhelmina
shrugged
her
shoulders
that
all
very
well
gilbert
she
said
but
what
should
we
do
if
we
could
get
rid
of
some
of
these
lunatics
for
at
least
part
of
the
day
reasonable
i
admit
deyes
answered
but
think
what
an
intolerable
nuisance
they
make
of
themselves
for
the
other
part
i
double
no
trumps
lady
peggy
lady
peggy
laid
down
her
cards
for
goodness
sake
no
more
digressions
she
implored
remember
please
that
i
play
this
game
for
the
peace
of
mind
of
my
tradespeople
i
redouble
the
hand
was
played
almost
in
silence
lady
peggy
lost
the
odd
trick
and
began
to
add
up
the
score
with
a
gentle
sigh
after
all
her
partner
remarked
returning
to
the
subject
which
they
had
been
discussing
i
do
think
that
we
could
get
on
very
well
in
this
country
without
sport
of
some
sort
of
course
not
deyes
answered
we
are
all
sportsmen
every
one
of
us
we
were
born
so
only
while
some
of
us
are
content
to
wreak
our
instinct
for
destruction
upon
birds
and
animals
others
choose
the
nobler
game
our
to
hunt
or
trap
a
human
being
is
finer
sport
than
to
shoot
a
rocketing
pheasant
or
to
come
in
from
hunting
with
mud
all
over
our
clothes
smelling
of
ploughed
fields
steaming
in
front
of
the
fire
telling
lies
about
our
exploits
all
undertaken
in
pursuit
of
a
miserable
little
animal
which
as
often
as
not
outwits
us
and
which
in
an
ordinary
way
we
would
touch
with
gloves
on
what
do
you
say
lady
peggy
you
getting
beyond
me
she
declared
it
sounds
a
little
savage
deyes
dealt
the
cards
slowly
talking
all
the
while
sport
is
savage
he
declared
no
one
can
deny
it
whether
the
quarry
be
human
or
animal
the
end
is
death
but
of
all
its
varieties
give
me
the
hunting
of
man
by
man
the
brain
of
the
hunter
coping
with
the
wiles
of
the
hunted
both
human
both
of
the
same
order
the
game
even
then
for
at
any
moment
they
may
change
places
the
hunter
and
his
quarry
it
finer
work
than
slaughtering
birds
at
the
coverside
it
gives
your
sex
a
chance
lady
peggy
it
sounds
exciting
she
admitted
it
is
he
answered
his
hostess
looked
up
at
him
languidly
you
speak
like
one
who
knows
why
not
he
murmured
i
have
been
both
quarry
and
hunter
most
of
us
have
more
or
less
i
declare
hearts
again
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
broken
only
by
the
stock
phrases
of
the
game
and
the
soft
patter
of
the
cards
upon
the
table
once
more
the
hand
was
played
out
and
the
cards
gathered
up
captain
austin
delivered
his
quota
to
the
general
discussion
after
all
he
said
if
it
was
for
sport
our
country
houses
would
be
useless
not
at
all
deyes
declared
country
houses
should
exist
for
for
what
deyes
do
tell
us
lady
peggy
implored
for
bridge
he
declared
for
giving
weary
married
people
the
opportunity
for
divorce
and
as
an
asylum
from
one
creditors
wilhelmina
shook
her
head
as
she
gathered
up
her
cards
you
are
not
at
your
best
gilbert
she
said
the
allusion
to
creditors
is
prehistoric
no
one
has
them
nowadays
society
is
such
a
affair
that
our
coffers
are
never
empty
what
a
utopian
sentiment
lady
peggy
murmured
we
ca
agree
can
we
deyes
whispered
in
her
ear
you
why
they
say
that
you
are
worth
a
million
she
protested
if
i
am
i
remain
poor
for
i
can
not
spend
it
he
declared
why
not
his
hostess
asked
him
from
across
the
table
because
he
answered
i
am
cursed
with
a
single
vice
trailing
its
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
virtues
i
am
a
miser
lady
peggy
laughed
incredulously
rubbish
she
exclaimed
dear
lady
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
he
answered
shaking
his
head
sadly
i
have
felt
it
growing
upon
me
for
years
besides
it
is
hereditary
my
mother
opened
a
savings
bank
account
for
me
at
an
early
age
i
engineered
a
corner
in
marbles
and
sold
out
at
a
huge
profit
i
am
like
the
starving
dyspeptic
at
the
rich
man
feast
captain
austin
intervened
i
declare
diamonds
he
announced
and
the
hand
proceeded
wilhelmina
leaned
back
in
her
chair
as
the
last
trick
fell
her
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
window
she
could
just
see
the
avenue
of
elms
down
which
her
agent
had
ridden
a
short
while
since
deyes
through
half
closed
eyes
watched
her
with
some
curiosity
if
one
dared
offer
a
trifling
coin
of
the
realm
he
murmured
i
was
thinking
of
your
theory
she
interrupted
according
to
you
i
suppose
the
whole
world
is
made
up
of
hunters
and
their
quarry
can
you
tell
i
wonder
by
looking
at
people
to
which
order
they
belong
it
is
easy
he
answered
yet
you
must
remember
we
are
continually
changing
places
the
man
who
cracks
the
whip
is
the
hunted
beast
the
woman
who
mocks
at
her
lover
this
afternoon
is
often
the
when
dusk
falls
swift
changes
like
this
are
like
rain
upon
the
earth
they
keep
us
at
any
rate
out
of
the
asylums
wilhelmina
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
up
the
great
avenue
in
and
out
amongst
the
tree
trunks
but
moving
always
with
swift
buoyant
footsteps
towards
the
house
came
a
slim
dark
figure
soberly
dressed
in
clothes
he
walked
with
the
swing
of
early
manhood
his
head
was
thrown
back
and
he
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
she
leaned
forward
to
watch
him
more
closely
he
seemed
to
have
associated
himself
in
some
mysterious
manner
with
the
mocking
words
of
gilbert
deyes
half
maliciously
she
drew
his
attention
to
the
swiftly
approaching
figure
come
my
friend
of
theories
she
said
mockingly
there
is
a
stranger
there
the
young
man
who
walks
so
swiftly
to
which
of
your
two
orders
does
he
belong
deyes
looked
out
of
the
window
a
brief
careless
glance
to
neither
he
answered
his
time
has
not
come
yet
but
he
has
the
makings
of
both
chapter
iii
first
blood
a
footman
entered
the
room
a
few
minutes
later
and
obedient
without
a
doubt
to
some
previously
given
command
waited
behind
his
chair
until
a
hand
had
been
played
when
it
was
over
she
spoke
to
him
without
turning
her
head
what
is
it
perkins
she
asked
he
bent
forward
respectfully
there
is
a
young
gentleman
here
madam
who
wishes
to
see
you
most
particularly
he
has
no
card
but
he
said
that
his
name
would
not
be
known
to
you
tell
him
that
i
am
engaged
wilhelmina
said
he
must
give
you
his
name
and
tell
you
what
business
he
has
come
upon
very
good
madam
the
man
answered
and
withdrew
he
was
back
again
before
the
next
hand
had
been
played
once
more
he
stood
waiting
in
respectful
silence
well
his
mistress
asked
his
name
madam
is
victor
macheson
he
said
that
he
would
wait
as
long
as
you
liked
but
he
preferred
telling
you
his
business
himself
i
fancy
that
i
know
it
wilhelmina
answered
you
can
show
him
in
here
is
it
the
young
man
i
wonder
lady
peggy
remarked
who
came
up
the
avenue
as
though
he
were
walking
on
air
doubtless
wilhelmina
answered
he
is
some
sort
of
a
missionary
i
had
him
shown
in
here
because
i
thought
his
coming
at
all
an
impertinence
and
i
want
to
make
him
understand
it
you
will
probably
find
him
amusing
mr
deyes
gilbert
deyes
shook
his
head
quietly
there
was
a
time
he
murmured
when
the
very
word
missionary
was
a
to
the
ridiculous
the
comic
papers
rob
us
however
of
our
elementary
sources
of
humour
they
all
looked
curiously
towards
the
door
as
he
entered
all
except
wilhelmina
who
was
the
last
to
turn
her
head
and
found
him
hesitating
in
some
embarrassment
as
to
whom
to
address
he
was
somewhat
above
medium
height
fair
with
a
mass
of
hair
and
had
the
smooth
face
of
a
boy
his
eyes
were
his
most
noticeable
feature
they
were
very
bright
and
very
restless
lady
peggy
called
them
afterwards
uncomfortable
eyes
and
the
others
without
any
explanation
understood
what
she
meant
i
am
miss
wilhelmina
said
calmly
i
am
told
that
you
wished
to
see
me
she
turned
only
her
head
towards
him
her
words
were
cold
and
unwelcoming
she
saw
that
he
was
nervous
and
she
had
no
pity
it
was
unworthy
of
her
she
knew
that
her
eyes
questioned
him
calmly
sitting
there
in
her
light
muslin
dress
with
her
hair
arranged
in
the
fashion
which
chanced
to
be
the
caprice
of
the
moment
she
herself
one
of
london
most
beautiful
women
seemed
little
more
than
a
girl
i
beg
your
pardon
he
began
hurriedly
i
understood
i
expected
well
the
monosyllable
was
like
a
drop
of
ice
a
faint
spot
of
colour
burned
in
his
cheeks
he
understood
now
that
for
some
reason
this
woman
was
inimical
to
him
the
knowledge
seemed
to
have
a
bracing
effect
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
fire
which
gave
force
to
his
face
i
expected
he
continued
with
more
assurance
to
have
found
miss
an
older
lady
she
said
nothing
only
her
eyebrows
were
very
slightly
raised
she
seemed
to
be
asking
him
silently
what
possible
concern
the
age
of
the
lady
of
could
be
to
him
he
was
to
understand
that
his
remark
was
almost
an
impertinence
i
wished
he
said
to
hold
a
service
in
thorpe
on
sunday
afternoon
and
also
one
during
the
week
and
i
wrote
to
your
agent
asking
for
the
loan
of
a
barn
which
is
generally
i
believe
used
for
any
gathering
of
the
villagers
hurd
found
himself
unable
to
grant
my
request
i
have
ventured
to
appeal
to
you
hurd
she
said
calmly
decided
in
my
opinion
quite
rightly
i
do
not
see
what
possible
need
my
villagers
can
have
of
further
religious
services
than
the
church
affords
them
madam
he
answered
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
your
parish
church
or
against
your
excellent
vicar
yet
i
believe
and
the
body
to
which
i
am
attached
believes
that
change
is
stimulating
we
believe
that
the
great
truths
of
life
can
not
be
presented
to
our
too
often
or
in
too
many
different
ways
and
what
she
asked
with
a
faint
curl
of
her
beautiful
lips
do
you
consider
the
great
truths
of
life
madam
he
answered
with
slightly
reddening
cheeks
they
vary
for
every
one
of
us
according
to
our
capacity
and
our
circumstances
what
they
may
mean
he
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
to
people
of
your
social
order
i
do
not
know
it
has
not
come
within
the
orbit
of
my
experience
it
was
your
villagers
to
whom
i
was
proposing
to
talk
there
was
a
moment
silence
gilbert
deyes
and
lady
peggy
exchanged
swift
glances
of
amused
understanding
wilhelmina
bit
her
lip
but
she
betrayed
no
other
sign
of
annoyance
to
what
religious
body
do
you
belong
she
asked
my
friends
he
answered
and
i
are
attached
to
none
of
the
recognized
denominations
our
only
object
is
to
try
to
keep
alight
in
our
the
flame
of
spirituality
we
want
to
help
them
not
to
forget
there
is
no
name
by
which
you
call
yourselves
she
asked
none
he
answered
and
your
headquarters
are
where
she
asked
in
gloucestershire
he
answered
so
far
as
we
can
be
said
to
have
any
headquarters
at
all
you
have
no
churches
then
she
asked
any
building
he
answered
where
the
people
are
to
whom
we
desire
to
speak
is
our
church
we
look
upon
ourselves
as
missioners
only
i
am
afraid
wilhelmina
said
quietly
that
i
am
only
wasting
your
time
in
asking
these
questions
still
i
should
like
to
know
what
induced
you
to
choose
my
village
as
an
appropriate
sphere
for
your
labours
we
each
took
a
county
he
answered
leicestershire
fell
to
my
lot
i
selected
thorpe
to
begin
with
because
i
have
heard
it
spoken
of
as
a
model
village
wilhelmina
forehead
was
gently
wrinkled
i
am
afraid
she
said
that
i
am
a
somewhat
dense
person
your
reason
seems
to
me
scarcely
an
adequate
one
our
belief
is
he
declared
that
where
material
prosperity
is
assured
especially
amongst
this
class
of
people
the
instincts
towards
spirituality
are
weakened
my
people
all
attend
church
we
have
no
there
are
never
any
scandals
she
said
all
these
things
he
admitted
are
excellent
but
they
do
not
help
you
to
see
into
the
lives
of
these
people
may
become
a
habit
a
respectable
and
praiseworthy
thing
and
a
thing
expected
of
them
morality
too
may
become
a
custom
until
temptation
comes
one
must
ask
oneself
what
is
the
force
which
prompts
these
people
to
direct
their
lives
in
so
praiseworthy
a
manner
you
forget
she
remarked
that
these
are
simple
folk
their
religion
with
them
is
simply
a
matter
of
right
or
wrong
they
need
no
further
instruction
in
this
madam
he
said
so
long
as
they
are
living
here
that
may
be
so
frankly
i
do
not
consider
it
sufficient
that
their
lives
are
seemly
so
long
as
they
live
in
the
shadow
of
your
patronage
what
happens
to
those
who
pass
outside
its
influence
is
another
matter
what
do
you
know
about
that
she
asked
coldly
what
i
do
know
about
it
he
answered
decided
me
to
come
to
thorpe
there
was
a
moment
silence
any
of
the
other
three
gilbert
deyes
especially
perhaps
would
have
found
it
hard
to
explain
even
to
realize
the
interest
with
which
they
listened
to
the
conversation
between
these
two
the
somewhat
unkempt
boy
with
the
nervous
forceful
manner
and
burning
eyes
and
the
woman
so
sure
of
herself
so
coldly
and
yet
brutally
ungracious
it
was
not
so
much
the
words
themselves
that
passed
between
them
that
attracted
as
the
undernote
of
hostility
more
felt
than
apparent
the
beginning
of
a
duel
to
all
appearance
so
ludicrously
onesided
yet
destined
to
endure
deyes
turned
in
his
chair
uneasily
he
was
watching
this
intruder
a
being
outwardly
so
far
removed
from
their
world
the
niceties
of
a
correct
toilet
had
certainly
never
troubled
him
his
clothes
were
rough
in
material
and
cut
he
wore
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
collar
so
low
that
his
neck
seemed
he
had
no
special
gifts
of
features
or
figure
his
manner
was
nervous
his
speech
none
too
ready
deyes
found
himself
engaged
in
a
swift
analysis
of
the
subtleties
of
personality
what
did
this
young
man
possess
that
he
should
convey
so
strong
a
sense
of
power
there
was
something
about
him
which
told
they
were
all
conscious
of
it
and
more
than
any
of
them
the
woman
who
was
regarding
him
with
such
studied
to
the
others
her
still
beautiful
face
betrayed
only
some
languid
irritation
deyes
fancied
that
he
saw
more
there
that
underneath
the
mask
which
she
knew
so
well
how
to
wear
there
were
traces
of
some
deeper
disturbance
do
you
mind
explaining
yourself
she
asked
that
sounds
rather
an
extraordinary
statement
of
yours
a
few
months
ago
he
said
i
attended
regularly
one
of
the
police
courts
in
london
day
by
day
i
came
into
contact
with
the
lost
souls
who
have
drifted
on
to
the
great
there
was
a
girl
martha
gullimore
her
name
was
whose
record
for
her
age
was
as
black
as
sin
could
make
it
her
father
i
believe
is
the
blacksmith
in
your
model
village
i
spoke
to
him
of
his
daughter
yesterday
and
he
cursed
me
you
mean
samuel
gullimore
my
farrier
she
asked
that
is
the
man
he
answered
have
you
any
other
instances
she
asked
more
than
one
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
replied
there
were
two
young
men
who
left
here
only
a
year
ago
one
is
the
son
of
your
gardener
the
other
was
brought
up
by
his
uncle
at
your
lodge
gates
i
was
instrumental
in
saving
them
from
prison
a
few
months
ago
one
we
have
shipped
to
canada
the
other
i
am
sorry
to
say
has
relapsed
we
did
what
we
could
but
beyond
a
certain
point
we
can
not
go
she
leaned
her
head
for
a
moment
upon
the
slim
white
fingers
of
her
right
hand
innocent
of
rings
save
for
one
great
emerald
whose
gleam
of
colour
was
almost
barbaric
in
its
momentary
splendour
her
face
had
hardened
a
little
her
tone
was
almost
an
offence
you
would
have
me
believe
then
she
said
that
my
peaceful
village
is
a
veritable
den
of
iniquity
not
i
he
answered
brusquely
only
i
would
have
you
realize
that
roses
and
honeysuckle
and
regular
wages
the
appurtenances
of
material
prosperity
are
after
all
things
of
little
consequence
they
hear
the
song
of
the
world
these
people
in
their
leisure
moments
their
young
men
and
girls
are
no
stronger
than
their
fellows
when
temptation
comes
deyes
leaned
suddenly
forward
in
his
chair
he
felt
that
his
intervention
dissipated
a
dramatic
interest
of
which
he
was
keenly
conscious
but
he
could
not
keep
silence
any
longer
to
follow
out
your
argument
sir
to
its
logical
conclusion
he
said
why
not
aim
higher
still
it
is
your
contention
is
it
not
that
the
seeds
of
evil
things
are
sown
in
indifference
that
prosperity
might
even
tend
towards
their
propagation
why
not
direct
your
energies
then
towards
the
men
and
women
of
society
there
is
plenty
of
scope
here
for
your
labours
the
young
man
turned
towards
him
the
lines
of
his
mouth
had
relaxed
into
a
smile
of
tolerant
indifference
i
have
no
sympathy
sir
he
answered
with
the
class
you
name
on
a
sinking
ship
the
cry
is
always
the
women
and
children
it
is
the
less
fortunate
in
the
world
possessions
who
represent
the
women
and
children
of
shipwrecked
morality
it
is
for
their
betterment
that
we
work
deyes
sighed
gently
it
is
a
pity
he
declared
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
a
magnificent
opening
for
mission
work
amongst
the
idle
classes
no
doubt
the
young
man
agreed
quickly
the
question
is
whether
the
game
is
worth
the
candle
deyes
made
no
reply
lady
peggy
was
laughing
softly
to
herself
i
have
heard
all
that
you
have
to
say
macheson
the
mistress
of
thorpe
said
calmly
and
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
think
your
presence
here
as
a
missioner
most
unnecessary
i
consider
it
in
fact
an
she
hesitated
with
a
sudden
flash
of
humour
in
his
eyes
he
supplied
the
word
an
impertinence
perhaps
the
word
is
not
mine
she
answered
but
i
accept
it
willingly
i
can
not
interfere
with
hurd
decision
as
to
the
barn
i
am
sorry
he
said
slowly
i
must
hold
my
meetings
out
of
doors
that
is
all
there
was
a
dangerous
glitter
in
her
beautiful
eyes
there
is
no
common
land
in
the
neighbourhood
she
said
and
you
will
of
course
understand
that
i
will
consider
you
a
trespasser
at
any
time
you
are
found
upon
my
property
he
bowed
slightly
i
am
here
to
speak
to
your
people
he
said
and
i
will
do
so
if
i
have
to
stop
in
these
lanes
and
talk
to
them
one
by
one
you
will
pardon
my
reminding
you
madam
that
the
days
of
feudalism
are
over
wilhelmina
carefully
shuffled
the
pack
of
cards
which
she
had
just
taken
up
we
will
finish
our
rubber
peggy
she
said
deyes
perhaps
i
may
trouble
you
to
ring
the
bell
the
young
man
was
across
the
room
before
deyes
could
move
you
will
allow
me
he
said
with
a
delightfully
humourous
smile
to
facilitate
my
own
dismissal
i
shall
doubtless
meet
your
man
in
the
hall
may
i
be
allowed
to
wish
you
all
good
afternoon
they
all
returned
his
farewell
save
wilhelmina
who
had
begun
to
deal
she
seemed
determined
to
remember
his
existence
no
more
yet
on
the
threshold
with
the
handle
of
the
door
between
his
fingers
he
turned
back
he
said
nothing
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
deyes
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
immensely
curious
softly
the
cards
fell
into
their
places
there
was
no
sign
in
her
face
of
any
consciousness
of
his
presence
deyes
alone
knew
that
she
was
fighting
he
heard
her
breath
come
quicker
saw
the
fingers
which
gathered
up
her
cards
shake
slowly
but
with
obvious
unwillingness
she
turned
her
head
she
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
still
lingered
good
afternoon
miss
he
said
pleasantly
i
am
sorry
to
have
troubled
you
her
lips
moved
but
she
said
nothing
she
half
inclined
her
head
the
door
was
softly
closed
chapter
iv
beating
her
wings
never
was
a
young
man
more
pleased
with
himself
than
stephen
hurd
on
the
night
he
dined
at
he
had
shot
well
all
day
and
been
accepted
with
the
utmost
cordiality
by
the
rest
of
the
party
at
dinner
time
his
hostess
had
placed
him
on
her
left
hand
and
though
it
was
true
she
had
not
much
to
say
to
him
it
was
equally
obvious
that
her
duties
were
sufficient
to
account
for
her
divided
attention
he
was
quite
willing
to
be
ignored
by
the
lady
on
his
other
side
a
little
elderly
and
noted
throughout
the
country
for
her
proclivities
he
recognized
the
fact
that
apart
from
the
personal
side
of
the
question
he
could
scarcely
hope
to
be
of
any
interest
to
her
the
novelty
of
the
situation
wilhelmina
occasional
remarks
and
a
dinner
such
as
he
had
never
tasted
before
were
sufficient
to
keep
him
interested
for
the
rest
he
was
content
to
twirl
his
moustache
of
which
he
was
inordinately
proud
and
lean
back
in
his
chair
with
the
comfortable
reflection
that
he
was
the
first
of
his
family
to
be
offered
the
complete
hospitality
of
towards
the
close
of
dinner
his
hostess
leaned
towards
him
have
you
seen
or
heard
anything
of
a
young
man
named
macheson
in
the
village
she
asked
i
have
seen
him
once
or
twice
he
answered
here
on
a
missionary
expedition
or
something
of
the
sort
i
believe
has
he
made
any
attempt
to
hold
a
meeting
she
asked
not
that
i
have
heard
of
he
replied
he
has
been
talking
to
some
of
the
people
though
i
saw
him
with
old
gullimore
yesterday
that
reminds
me
she
remarked
is
it
true
that
gullimore
has
had
trouble
with
his
daughter
i
believe
so
young
hurd
admitted
looking
downwards
at
his
plate
the
man
was
to
blame
for
letting
her
leave
the
place
wilhelmina
declared
in
cold
measured
tones
a
pretty
girl
i
remember
but
very
vain
and
a
fool
of
course
but
about
this
young
fellow
macheson
do
you
know
who
he
is
and
where
he
came
from
stephen
hurd
shook
his
head
i
afraid
i
do
he
said
doubtfully
he
belongs
to
some
sort
of
brotherhood
i
believe
i
ca
exactly
make
out
what
he
at
seems
a
queer
sort
of
place
for
him
to
come
missioning
this
so
i
told
him
she
said
by
the
bye
do
you
know
where
he
is
staying
at
onetree
farm
the
young
man
answered
wilhelmina
frowned
will
you
execute
a
commission
for
me
she
asked
with
pleasure
he
answered
eagerly
you
will
go
to
the
woman
at
onetree
farm
i
forget
her
name
and
say
that
i
desire
to
take
her
rooms
myself
from
or
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
pay
her
for
them
but
i
do
not
wish
that
young
man
to
be
taken
in
by
any
of
my
tenants
you
will
perhaps
make
that
known
i
will
do
so
he
declared
i
hope
he
will
have
the
good
sense
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
i
trust
so
wilhelmina
replied
she
turned
away
to
speak
once
more
to
the
man
on
her
other
side
and
did
not
address
stephen
hurd
again
he
watched
her
covertly
with
tingling
pulses
as
she
devoted
herself
to
her
neighbour
the
of
the
county
he
considered
himself
a
judge
of
the
sex
but
he
had
had
few
opportunities
even
of
admiring
such
women
as
the
mistress
of
thorpe
he
watched
the
curve
of
her
white
neck
with
its
delicate
skin
the
play
of
her
features
the
poise
of
her
somewhat
small
oval
head
he
admired
the
slightly
wearied
air
with
which
she
performed
her
duties
and
accepted
the
compliments
of
her
neighbour
a
woman
of
mysteries
some
one
had
once
called
her
and
he
realized
that
it
was
the
mouth
and
the
dark
tired
eyes
which
puzzled
those
who
attempted
to
classify
her
what
a
triumph
to
bring
her
down
to
the
world
of
ordinary
women
to
drive
the
weariness
away
to
feel
the
soft
touch
perhaps
of
those
wonderful
arms
he
was
a
young
man
of
many
conquests
and
with
a
sufficiently
good
idea
of
himself
the
thought
was
like
wine
in
his
blood
if
only
it
were
possible
he
relapsed
into
a
from
which
he
was
aroused
only
by
the
soft
flutter
of
gowns
and
laces
as
the
women
rose
to
go
there
was
a
momentary
disarrangement
of
seats
gilbert
deyes
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
rose
and
carrying
his
glass
in
his
hand
came
deliberately
round
to
the
vacant
seat
by
the
young
man
side
in
his
evening
clothes
the
length
and
gauntness
of
his
face
and
figure
seemed
more
noticeable
than
ever
his
skin
was
dry
almost
like
parchment
and
his
eyes
by
contrast
appeared
unnaturally
bright
his
new
neighbour
noticed
too
that
the
glass
which
he
carried
so
carefully
contained
nothing
but
water
i
will
come
and
talk
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
deyes
said
i
leave
the
church
and
agriculture
to
hobnob
somehow
i
do
fancy
that
as
a
buffer
i
should
be
a
success
young
hurd
smiled
amiably
he
was
more
than
a
little
flattered
the
archdeacon
he
remarked
is
not
an
inspiring
neighbour
deyes
lit
one
of
his
own
cigarettes
and
passed
his
case
i
have
found
the
archdeacon
very
dull
he
admitted
a
privilege
of
his
order
i
suppose
by
the
bye
you
are
having
a
dose
of
religion
from
a
new
source
hereabouts
are
you
not
you
mean
this
young
missioner
hurd
inquired
doubtfully
deyes
nodded
i
was
with
our
hostess
when
he
came
up
to
ask
for
the
loan
of
a
barn
to
hold
services
in
a
very
queer
sort
of
person
i
should
think
i
have
spoken
to
him
hurd
answered
but
i
should
think
he
more
or
less
mad
i
can
understand
mission
and
salvation
army
work
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
cities
but
i
hanged
if
i
can
understand
any
one
coming
to
thorpe
with
such
notions
our
hostess
is
annoyed
about
it
i
imagine
deyes
remarked
she
seems
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
the
fellow
hurd
admitted
she
was
speaking
to
me
about
him
just
now
he
is
to
be
turned
out
of
his
lodgings
here
gilbert
deyes
smiled
the
news
interested
him
our
hostess
is
practical
in
her
dislikes
he
remarked
why
not
his
neighbour
answered
the
place
belongs
to
her
deyes
watched
for
a
moment
the
smoke
from
his
cigarette
curling
upwards
the
young
man
he
said
thoughtfully
impressed
me
as
being
a
person
of
some
determination
i
wonder
whether
he
will
consent
to
accept
defeat
so
easily
the
agent
son
scarcely
saw
what
else
there
was
for
him
to
do
there
is
anywhere
round
here
he
remarked
where
they
would
take
him
in
against
miss
wishes
besides
he
has
nowhere
to
preach
his
coming
here
at
all
was
a
huge
mistake
if
he
a
sensible
person
he
admit
it
deyes
nodded
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
lounged
towards
the
door
with
the
other
men
play
bridge
he
asked
his
companion
as
they
crossed
the
hall
a
little
the
young
man
answered
for
moderate
stakes
they
entered
the
and
deyes
made
his
way
to
a
secluded
corner
where
lady
peggy
sat
scribbling
alone
in
a
my
dear
lady
peggy
he
inquired
whence
this
exceptional
industry
she
closed
the
book
and
looked
up
at
him
with
twinkling
eyes
well
i
did
mean
to
tell
a
soul
until
it
was
finished
she
declared
but
you
just
caught
me
i
had
such
a
brilliant
idea
i
going
to
write
a
society
encyclopædia
deyes
looked
at
her
solemnly
a
society
encyclopædia
he
repeated
uncertainly
my
word
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
she
motioned
him
to
sit
down
by
her
side
i
explain
she
said
you
know
we
all
expected
to
know
something
about
everything
nowadays
and
it
such
a
bore
reading
up
things
going
to
compile
a
little
volume
of
definitions
i
shall
sell
it
at
a
guinea
a
copy
pay
all
my
debts
and
become
quite
respectable
again
deyes
shook
his
head
his
attitude
was
scarcely
sympathetic
my
dear
lady
peggy
what
nonsense
he
declared
respectable
indeed
i
call
it
positively
pandering
to
the
middle
classes
lady
peggy
looked
doubtful
it
is
a
horrid
word
is
it
she
admitted
but
it
would
be
lovely
to
make
some
money
of
course
i
have
absolutely
decided
how
to
spend
it
yet
it
does
seem
rather
a
waste
does
it
to
pay
one
debts
but
think
of
the
luxury
of
feeling
one
could
do
it
if
one
wanted
to
there
something
in
that
deyes
admitted
but
an
encyclopædia
my
dear
lady
peggy
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
got
one
somewhere
i
know
it
came
in
a
van
and
it
took
two
of
the
men
to
unload
it
lady
peggy
laughed
softly
oh
i
do
mean
that
sort
of
course
she
declared
i
mean
just
a
little
text
book
bound
in
morocco
you
know
with
just
those
things
in
it
we
likely
to
run
up
against
radium
for
instance
now
every
one
talking
about
radium
do
you
know
what
radium
is
deyes
swung
his
eyeglass
carefully
by
its
black
riband
well
he
admitted
i
a
sort
of
idea
but
i
not
very
good
at
definitions
of
course
not
lady
peggy
declared
triumphantly
when
it
comes
to
the
point
you
see
what
a
good
idea
mine
is
you
turn
to
my
textbook
she
added
turning
the
pages
over
rapidly
and
there
you
are
radium
hard
rare
substance
invented
by
gillette
to
give
tone
to
his
bachelor
parties
what
do
you
think
of
that
wonderful
deyes
declared
solemnly
where
do
you
get
your
information
from
oh
i
poke
about
in
dictionaries
and
things
and
ask
every
one
questions
lady
peggy
declared
airily
would
you
like
to
hear
some
more
our
hostess
is
beckoning
to
me
deyes
answered
rising
i
expect
she
wants
some
bridge
i
on
lady
peggy
declared
cheerfully
whom
shall
we
get
for
a
fourth
wilhelmina
has
found
him
already
deyes
declared
it
the
new
young
man
i
think
lady
peggy
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
agent
son
she
remarked
i
should
have
thought
that
he
would
have
cared
about
our
points
he
can
afford
it
for
once
in
a
way
i
should
imagine
deyes
answered
i
ca
understand
though
he
stopped
short
she
looked
at
him
curiously
is
it
possible
she
murmured
that
there
exists
anything
which
gilbert
deyes
does
not
understand
many
things
he
answered
amongst
them
why
does
wilhelmina
patronize
this
young
man
he
is
well
enough
of
course
but
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
expressively
the
thing
needs
an
explanation
does
it
if
wilhelmina
were
not
wilhelmina
it
certainly
would
lady
peggy
answered
i
call
her
craving
for
new
things
and
new
people
positively
morbid
all
the
time
she
beats
her
wings
against
the
bars
there
are
no
new
things
there
are
no
new
experiences
the
sooner
one
makes
up
mind
to
it
the
better
gilbert
deyes
laughed
softly
if
my
memory
serves
me
he
said
you
are
repeating
a
cry
many
thousand
years
old
was
there
a
prophet
there
was
she
interrupted
but
they
are
beckoning
us
i
hope
i
cut
with
the
young
man
i
do
believe
he
has
a
bridge
face
chapter
v
evicted
victor
macheson
smoked
his
pipe
with
the
lazy
enjoyment
of
one
who
is
thoroughly
at
peace
with
himself
and
his
surroundings
the
tiny
strip
of
lawn
on
to
which
he
had
dragged
his
chair
was
surrounded
with
straggling
bushes
of
cottage
flowers
and
flanked
by
a
hedge
thick
with
honeysuckle
straight
to
heaven
as
the
flight
of
a
bird
the
thin
line
of
blue
smoke
curled
upwards
to
the
summer
sky
the
very
air
seemed
full
of
sweet
scents
and
soothing
sounds
a
few
yards
away
a
procession
of
lazy
cows
moved
leisurely
along
the
lane
from
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
came
the
cheerful
sound
of
a
driven
slowly
through
the
field
of
golden
corn
the
man
through
half
closed
eyes
looked
out
upon
these
things
and
every
line
in
his
face
spelt
contentment
in
repose
the
artistic
temperament
with
which
he
was
deeply
imbued
asserted
itself
more
clearly
the
almost
fanatical
light
in
his
eyes
was
softened
one
saw
there
was
something
of
the
wistfulness
of
those
who
seek
to
raise
but
a
corner
of
the
veil
that
hangs
before
the
world
of
hidden
things
something
too
of
the
subdued
joy
which
even
the
effort
brings
the
lines
of
his
forceful
mouth
were
less
firm
more
sensitive
a
greater
sense
of
humanity
seemed
somehow
to
have
descended
upon
him
as
he
lounged
there
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
with
the
full
joy
of
his
beautiful
environment
creeping
through
his
blood
if
you
please
macheson
some
one
said
in
his
ear
he
turned
his
head
at
once
a
tall
fair
girl
had
stepped
out
of
the
room
where
he
had
been
breakfasting
and
was
standing
by
his
elbow
she
was
neatly
dressed
pretty
in
a
somewhat
insipid
fashion
and
her
hands
and
hair
showed
signs
of
a
refinement
superior
to
her
station
just
now
she
was
apparently
nervous
macheson
smiled
at
her
encouragingly
well
letty
he
said
what
is
it
i
wanted
can
i
say
something
to
you
mr
macheson
she
began
why
not
he
answered
kindly
is
it
anything
very
serious
out
with
it
i
was
thinking
macheson
she
said
that
i
should
like
to
leave
home
if
i
could
if
there
was
anything
which
i
could
do
i
wanted
to
ask
your
advice
he
laid
down
his
pipe
and
looked
at
her
seriously
why
letty
he
said
how
long
have
you
been
thinking
of
this
oh
ever
so
long
sir
she
exclaimed
speaking
with
more
confidence
you
see
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
here
except
when
there
any
one
staying
like
you
sir
and
that
not
often
mother
wo
let
me
help
with
the
rough
work
and
ruth
growing
up
now
she
ever
such
a
strong
girl
and
i
should
like
to
go
away
if
i
could
and
learn
to
be
a
little
more
more
ladylike
she
added
with
reddening
cheeks
macheson
was
puzzled
the
girl
was
not
looking
him
in
the
face
he
felt
there
was
something
at
the
back
of
it
all
my
dear
girl
he
said
you
ca
learn
to
be
ladylike
that
one
of
the
things
that
born
with
you
or
it
is
you
can
be
just
as
much
a
lady
helping
your
mother
here
as
practising
grimaces
in
a
london
but
i
want
to
improve
myself
she
persisted
go
for
a
long
walk
every
day
and
look
about
you
he
said
read
lend
you
some
books
the
right
sort
you
do
better
here
than
away
she
was
frankly
dissatisfied
but
i
want
to
go
away
she
declared
i
want
to
leave
thorpe
for
a
time
i
should
like
to
go
to
london
could
i
get
a
situation
as
lady
help
or
companion
or
something
of
that
sort
i
should
want
any
money
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
does
your
mother
know
of
this
letty
he
asked
she
would
object
the
girl
answered
eagerly
she
lets
me
do
what
i
like
had
you
better
tell
me
the
rest
macheson
asked
quietly
the
girl
looked
away
uneasily
there
is
no
rest
she
protested
weakly
macheson
shook
his
head
letty
he
said
if
you
have
formed
any
ideas
of
a
definite
future
for
yourself
different
from
any
you
see
before
you
here
tell
me
what
they
are
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
help
you
but
if
you
simply
want
to
go
away
because
you
are
dissatisfied
with
the
life
here
because
you
fancy
yourself
superior
to
it
well
i
sorry
but
i
sooner
prevent
your
going
than
help
you
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
oh
macheson
it
is
that
she
declared
i
i
do
want
to
tell
any
one
but
i
very
very
fond
of
some
one
who
quite
different
i
think
he
fond
of
me
too
she
added
softly
but
always
used
to
being
with
ladies
and
i
wanted
to
improve
myself
so
much
i
thought
if
i
went
to
london
she
added
wistfully
i
might
learn
macheson
laughed
cheerfully
he
laid
his
hand
for
a
moment
upon
her
arm
oh
letty
letty
he
declared
you
a
foolish
little
girl
now
listen
to
me
if
he
a
good
sort
and
i
sure
he
is
or
you
be
fond
of
him
he
like
you
just
exactly
as
you
are
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
be
a
lady
the
supreme
test
of
good
manners
it
means
to
be
natural
take
my
advice
go
on
helping
your
mother
enter
into
the
village
life
make
friends
with
the
other
girls
do
imagine
yourself
a
bit
superior
to
anybody
else
read
when
you
have
time
i
manage
the
books
for
you
and
spend
all
the
time
you
can
out
of
doors
it
sound
advice
letty
take
my
word
for
it
hullo
who
this
a
new
sound
in
the
lane
made
them
both
turn
their
heads
young
hurd
had
just
ridden
up
and
was
fastening
his
pony
to
the
fence
he
looked
across
at
them
curiously
and
letty
retreated
precipitately
into
the
house
a
moment
or
two
later
he
came
up
the
narrow
path
frowning
at
macheson
over
the
low
hedge
of
foxgloves
and
cottage
roses
and
barely
returning
his
courteous
greeting
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
however
as
though
about
to
speak
then
changing
his
mind
he
passed
on
and
entered
the
farmhouse
he
met
foulton
herself
in
the
passage
and
she
welcomed
him
with
a
smiling
face
good
morning
hurd
sir
she
exclaimed
plucking
at
her
apron
wo
you
come
inside
sir
and
sit
down
the
parlour
let
to
macheson
there
but
he
out
in
the
garden
and
he
wo
mind
your
stepping
in
for
a
moment
and
how
your
father
hurd
wonderful
well
he
was
looking
when
i
saw
him
last
the
young
man
followed
her
inside
but
declined
a
chair
oh
the
governor
all
right
foulton
he
answered
never
knew
him
anything
else
good
weather
for
the
harvest
eh
beautiful
sir
foulton
answered
were
you
wanting
to
speak
to
john
stephen
he
about
the
home
meadow
somewhere
or
in
the
orchard
i
can
send
a
boy
for
him
or
perhaps
you
step
out
it
you
i
came
to
see
foulton
the
young
man
said
and
my
word
i
do
like
my
errand
much
foulton
was
visibly
anxious
there
no
trouble
like
i
hope
sir
she
began
oh
it
nothing
serious
he
declared
reassuringly
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
about
your
lodger
about
macheson
sir
the
woman
exclaimed
yes
do
you
know
how
long
he
was
proposing
to
stay
with
you
he
just
took
the
rooms
for
another
week
sir
she
answered
and
a
nicer
lodger
or
one
more
quiet
and
regular
in
his
habits
i
never
had
or
wish
to
have
there
nothing
against
him
sir
surely
nothing
personal
that
i
know
of
hurd
answered
tapping
his
boots
with
his
the
fact
of
it
is
he
has
offended
miss
and
she
wants
him
out
of
the
place
well
i
never
did
foulton
exclaimed
in
amazement
him
offend
miss
so
he
is
too
i
sure
i
ca
imagine
his
saying
a
wry
word
to
anybody
he
has
come
to
thorpe
hurd
explained
on
an
errand
of
which
miss
disapproves
and
she
does
not
wish
to
have
him
in
the
place
she
knows
that
he
is
staying
here
and
she
wishes
you
to
send
him
away
at
once
foulton
face
fell
well
i
fair
sorry
to
hear
this
sir
she
declared
it
only
this
morning
that
he
spoke
for
the
rooms
for
another
week
and
i
was
glad
and
willing
enough
to
let
them
to
him
well
i
never
did
it
does
sound
all
anyhow
do
it
sir
to
be
telling
him
to
pack
up
and
go
i
will
speak
to
him
myself
if
you
like
foulton
stephen
said
of
course
miss
does
not
wish
you
to
lose
anything
and
i
am
to
pay
you
the
rent
of
the
rooms
for
the
time
he
engaged
them
i
will
do
so
at
once
if
you
will
let
me
know
how
much
it
is
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
but
foulton
drew
back
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
drawn
tightly
together
thank
you
stephen
she
said
i
obey
miss
wishes
of
course
as
in
duty
bound
but
i
not
take
any
money
for
the
rooms
thank
you
all
the
same
do
be
foolish
foulton
the
young
man
said
pleasantly
it
will
annoy
miss
if
she
knows
you
have
refused
and
you
may
just
as
well
have
the
money
let
me
see
shall
we
say
a
couple
of
sovereigns
for
the
week
foulton
shook
her
head
i
not
take
anything
sir
thank
you
all
the
same
and
if
you
say
a
word
to
macheson
i
be
much
obliged
i
rather
any
one
spoke
to
him
than
me
stephen
hurd
pocketed
the
money
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
just
as
you
like
of
course
foulton
he
said
i
go
out
and
speak
to
the
young
gentleman
at
once
he
strolled
out
and
looked
over
the
hedge
macheson
i
believe
he
remarked
interrogatively
macheson
nodded
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
you
are
hurd
son
are
you
not
he
said
pleasantly
wonderful
morning
is
it
young
hurd
stepped
over
the
rose
bushes
the
two
men
stood
side
by
side
something
of
a
height
only
that
the
better
cut
of
hurd
clothes
showed
his
figure
to
greater
advantage
i
sorry
to
say
that
i
come
on
rather
a
disagreeable
errand
the
agent
son
began
i
been
talking
to
foulton
about
it
indeed
macheson
remarked
interrogatively
the
fact
is
you
seem
to
have
rubbed
up
against
our
great
lady
here
young
hurd
continued
she
very
down
on
these
services
you
were
going
to
hold
and
she
wants
to
see
you
out
of
the
place
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
macheson
said
and
once
more
waited
it
is
a
pleasant
task
stephen
continued
liking
his
errand
less
as
he
proceeded
but
i
had
to
tell
foulton
that
that
in
short
miss
does
not
wish
her
tenants
to
accept
you
as
a
lodger
miss
makes
war
on
a
wide
scale
macheson
remarked
smiling
faintly
well
after
all
you
see
hurd
explained
the
whole
place
belongs
to
her
and
there
is
no
particular
reason
is
there
why
she
should
tolerate
any
one
in
it
of
whom
she
disapproves
none
whatever
macheson
assented
gravely
i
promised
foulton
i
would
speak
to
you
stephen
continued
stepping
backwards
i
sure
for
her
sake
you
wo
make
any
trouble
good
morning
macheson
bowed
slightly
good
morning
he
answered
stephen
hurd
lingered
even
then
upon
the
garden
path
somehow
he
was
not
satisfied
with
his
interview
with
his
own
position
at
the
end
of
it
he
had
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
belittlement
of
having
played
a
small
part
in
a
not
altogether
worthy
game
the
indifference
of
the
other
manner
nettled
him
he
tried
a
parting
shaft
foulton
said
something
about
your
having
engaged
the
rooms
for
another
week
he
said
turning
back
of
course
if
you
insist
upon
staying
it
will
place
the
woman
in
a
very
awkward
position
macheson
had
resumed
his
seat
i
should
not
dream
he
said
coolly
of
resisting
your
decree
i
shall
leave
here
in
half
an
hour
young
hurd
walked
angrily
down
the
path
and
slammed
the
gate
the
sense
of
having
been
worsted
was
strong
upon
him
he
recognized
his
own
limitations
too
accurately
not
to
be
aware
that
he
had
been
in
conflict
with
a
stronger
personality
d
the
fellow
he
muttered
as
he
cantered
down
the
lane
i
wish
he
were
out
of
the
place
a
genuine
wish
and
one
which
betrayed
at
least
a
glimmering
of
a
prophetic
instinct
in
some
dim
way
he
seemed
to
understand
even
before
the
first
move
on
the
board
that
the
coming
of
victor
macheson
to
thorpe
was
inimical
to
himself
he
was
conscious
of
his
weakness
of
a
marked
inferiority
and
the
consciousness
was
galling
the
fellow
had
no
right
to
be
a
gentleman
he
told
himself
angrily
a
gentleman
and
a
missioner
macheson
his
pipe
and
called
to
foulton
foulton
he
said
pleasantly
i
have
to
go
your
great
lady
does
like
me
on
the
estate
i
dare
say
she
right
i
sure
i
very
sorry
sir
foulton
declared
shamefacedly
you
seen
young
mr
hurd
he
was
kind
enough
to
explain
the
situation
to
me
macheson
answered
i
afraid
i
am
rather
a
nuisance
to
everybody
if
i
am
it
because
they
do
quite
understand
i
sure
sir
foulton
affirmed
a
nicer
lodger
no
one
ever
had
and
as
for
them
services
and
the
vicar
objecting
to
them
i
ca
see
what
harm
they
do
we
none
of
us
so
good
but
we
might
be
a
bit
better
a
very
sound
remark
foulton
macheson
said
smiling
and
now
you
must
make
out
my
bill
please
and
what
about
a
few
sandwiches
you
could
manage
that
i
going
to
play
in
a
cricket
match
this
afternoon
why
you
just
paid
the
bill
sir
there
only
breakfast
and
the
sandwiches
you
welcome
to
and
very
sorry
i
am
to
part
with
you
sir
better
luck
another
time
i
hope
foulton
he
answered
smiling
i
must
go
upstairs
and
pack
my
bag
i
sha
forget
your
garden
with
its
delicious
flowers
it
a
shame
as
you
got
to
leave
it
sir
foulton
said
heartily
if
my
richard
were
alive
he
never
have
let
you
go
for
all
the
miss
in
the
world
but
john
he
little
more
than
a
lad
he
be
frightened
to
death
for
fear
of
losing
the
farm
if
i
so
much
as
said
a
word
to
him
macheson
laughed
softly
john
a
good
son
he
said
do
you
worry
him
he
went
up
to
his
tiny
bedroom
and
changed
his
clothes
for
a
suit
of
flannels
then
he
packed
his
few
belongings
and
walked
out
into
the
world
he
lit
a
pipe
and
shouldered
his
portmanteau
there
is
a
flavour
of
martyrdom
about
this
affair
he
said
to
himself
as
he
strolled
along
which
appeals
to
me
i
do
think
that
young
man
has
any
sense
of
humour
he
paused
every
now
and
then
to
listen
to
the
birds
and
admire
the
view
he
had
the
air
of
one
thoroughly
enjoying
his
walk
presently
he
turned
off
the
main
road
and
wandered
along
a
steep
green
lane
which
was
little
more
than
a
here
he
met
no
one
the
country
on
either
side
was
common
land
sown
with
rocks
and
the
poorest
soil
picturesque
but
almost
impossible
of
cultivation
a
few
sheep
were
grazing
upon
the
hills
but
other
sign
of
life
there
was
none
not
a
farmhouse
scarcely
a
keeper
cottage
in
sight
it
was
a
forgotten
corner
of
a
not
unpopulous
county
the
farthest
portion
of
a
belt
of
primeval
forest
land
older
than
history
itself
macheson
laughed
softly
as
he
reached
the
spot
he
had
had
in
his
mind
and
threw
his
bag
over
the
grey
stone
wall
into
the
cool
shade
of
a
dense
fragment
of
wood
so
much
he
murmured
softly
for
the
lady
of
thorpe
chapter
vi
cricket
and
philosophy
the
instinct
for
games
wilhelmina
remarked
is
one
which
i
never
possessed
let
us
see
whether
we
can
learn
something
in
obedience
to
her
gesture
the
horses
were
checked
and
the
footman
clambered
down
and
stood
at
their
heads
deyes
from
his
somewhat
uncomfortable
back
seat
in
the
victoria
leaned
forward
and
adjusting
his
eyeglass
studied
the
scene
with
interest
here
he
remarked
we
have
the
fool
upon
his
native
heath
they
are
playing
a
game
which
my
memory
tells
me
is
cricket
everyone
seems
very
hot
and
very
excited
wilhelmina
beckoned
to
the
footman
to
come
round
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
james
she
said
do
you
know
what
all
this
means
she
waved
her
hand
towards
the
cricket
pitch
the
umpires
with
their
white
coats
the
tent
and
the
crowd
of
spectators
the
man
touched
his
hat
it
is
a
cricket
match
madam
he
answered
between
thorpe
and
nesborough
wilhelmina
looked
once
more
towards
the
field
and
recognized
hurd
upon
his
stout
little
cob
go
and
tell
hurd
to
come
and
speak
to
me
she
ordered
the
man
hastened
off
hurd
had
not
once
turned
his
head
his
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
game
the
groom
found
it
necessary
to
touch
him
on
the
arm
before
he
could
attract
his
attention
even
when
he
had
delivered
his
message
the
agent
waited
until
the
finish
of
the
over
before
he
moved
then
he
cantered
his
pony
up
to
the
waiting
carriage
wilhelmina
greeted
him
graciously
i
want
to
know
about
the
cricket
match
hurd
she
asked
smiling
hurd
wheeled
his
pony
round
so
that
he
could
still
watch
the
game
i
am
afraid
that
we
are
going
to
be
beaten
madam
he
said
dolefully
nesborough
made
a
hundred
and
and
we
have
six
wickets
down
for
fifty
wilhelmina
seemed
scarcely
to
realize
the
tragedy
which
his
words
unfolded
i
suppose
they
are
the
stronger
team
are
they
she
remarked
they
ought
to
be
nesborough
is
quite
a
large
town
we
have
beaten
them
regularly
until
the
last
two
years
hurd
answered
we
should
beat
them
now
but
for
their
fast
bowler
mills
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
our
men
will
not
stand
up
to
him
perhaps
they
are
afraid
of
being
hurt
wilhelmina
suggested
innocently
if
that
is
he
bowling
now
i
sure
i
do
wonder
at
it
hurd
frowned
we
do
have
men
in
the
eleven
who
are
afraid
of
getting
hurt
he
remarked
stiffly
a
shout
of
dismay
from
the
onlookers
a
smothered
exclamation
from
hurd
and
a
man
was
seen
on
his
way
to
the
pavilion
his
wickets
were
spreadeagled
and
the
ball
was
being
tossed
about
the
field
another
wicket
the
agent
exclaimed
testily
crooks
played
all
round
that
ball
is
that
your
son
going
in
mr
hurd
wilhelmina
asked
yes
stephen
is
in
now
his
father
answered
if
he
gets
out
the
match
is
over
who
is
the
other
batsman
deyes
asked
antill
the
second
bailiff
hurd
answered
he
captain
and
he
can
stay
in
all
day
but
he
ca
make
runs
they
all
leaned
forward
to
witness
the
continuation
of
the
match
stephen
hurd
career
was
brief
and
inglorious
he
took
guard
and
looked
carefully
round
the
field
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
going
to
give
trouble
then
he
saw
the
victoria
with
its
vision
of
parasols
and
fluttering
laces
and
the
sight
was
fatal
to
him
he
slogged
wildly
at
the
first
ball
missed
it
and
paid
the
penalty
the
lady
in
the
carriage
frowned
and
hurd
muttered
something
under
his
breath
as
he
watched
his
son
on
the
way
back
to
the
tent
i
afraid
it
all
up
with
us
now
he
remarked
we
have
only
three
more
men
to
go
in
then
we
are
going
to
be
beaten
wilhelmina
remarked
i
afraid
so
hurd
assented
gloomily
the
next
batsman
had
issued
from
the
tent
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
wicket
wilhelmina
who
had
been
about
to
give
an
order
to
the
footman
watched
him
curiously
who
is
that
going
in
she
asked
abruptly
hurd
was
looking
not
altogether
comfortable
it
is
the
young
man
who
wanted
to
preach
he
answered
wilhelmina
frowned
why
is
he
playing
she
asked
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
thorpe
he
came
down
to
see
them
practise
a
few
evenings
ago
and
antill
asked
him
the
agent
answered
if
i
had
known
earlier
i
would
have
stopped
it
wilhelmina
did
not
immediately
reply
she
was
watching
the
young
man
who
stood
now
at
the
wicket
bat
in
hand
in
his
flannels
he
seemed
a
very
different
person
from
the
missioner
whose
request
a
few
days
ago
had
so
much
offended
her
nevertheless
her
lip
curled
as
she
saw
the
terrible
mills
prepare
to
deliver
his
first
ball
that
sort
of
person
she
remarked
is
scarcely
likely
to
be
much
good
at
games
oh
her
exclamation
was
repeated
in
various
forms
from
all
over
the
field
macheson
had
hit
his
first
ball
high
over
their
heads
and
a
storm
of
applause
broke
from
the
bystanders
the
batsman
made
no
attempt
to
run
what
is
that
wilhelmina
asked
a
boundary
magnificent
drive
hurd
answered
excitedly
by
jove
another
the
agent
dropped
his
reins
and
led
the
applause
along
the
ground
this
time
the
ball
had
come
at
such
a
pace
that
the
fieldsman
made
a
very
attempt
to
stop
it
it
passed
the
horses
feet
by
only
a
few
yards
the
coachman
turned
round
and
touched
his
hat
shall
i
move
farther
back
madam
he
asked
stay
where
you
are
wilhelmina
answered
shortly
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
tall
lithe
figure
once
more
facing
the
bowler
the
next
ball
was
the
last
of
the
over
macheson
played
it
carefully
for
a
single
and
stood
prepared
for
the
bowling
at
the
other
end
he
began
by
a
graceful
cut
for
two
and
followed
it
up
by
a
square
leg
hit
clean
out
of
the
ground
for
the
next
half
an
hour
the
thorpe
villagers
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
never
since
the
days
of
one
foulds
a
former
blacksmith
had
they
seen
such
an
exhibition
of
hurricane
hitting
the
fast
bowler
knocked
clean
off
his
length
became
wild
and
erratic
once
he
only
missed
macheson
head
by
an
inch
but
his
next
ball
was
driven
fair
and
square
out
of
the
ground
for
six
the
applause
became
frantic
wilhelmina
was
leaning
back
amongst
the
cushions
of
her
carriage
watching
the
game
through
half
closed
eyes
and
with
some
apparent
return
of
her
usual
graceful
languor
nevertheless
she
remained
there
and
her
eyes
seldom
wandered
for
a
moment
from
the
scene
of
play
beneath
her
apparent
indifference
she
was
watching
this
young
man
with
an
interest
for
which
she
would
have
found
it
hard
to
account
and
which
instinct
alone
prompted
her
to
conceal
it
was
a
very
ordinary
scene
after
all
of
which
he
was
the
dominant
figure
she
had
seen
so
much
of
life
on
a
larger
scale
of
men
playing
heroic
parts
in
the
limelight
of
a
stage
as
mighty
as
this
was
insignificant
yet
without
stopping
to
reason
about
it
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
sense
of
pleasure
in
watching
the
doings
of
this
forceful
young
giant
with
an
easy
smile
replaced
every
now
and
then
with
a
grim
look
of
determination
as
he
jumped
out
from
the
crease
to
hit
he
continued
his
victorious
career
until
a
more
frantic
burst
of
applause
than
usual
announced
that
the
match
was
won
then
wilhelmina
turned
towards
stephen
hurd
who
was
standing
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
you
executed
my
commission
she
asked
respecting
that
young
man
the
first
thing
this
morning
he
answered
i
went
up
to
see
foulton
and
i
also
spoke
to
him
did
he
make
any
difficulty
none
at
all
the
young
man
answered
what
did
he
say
stephen
hesitated
but
wilhelmina
waited
for
his
reply
she
had
the
air
of
one
remotely
interested
yet
she
waited
obviously
to
hear
what
this
young
man
had
said
i
think
he
said
something
about
your
making
war
upon
a
large
scale
stephen
explained
diffidently
she
sat
still
for
a
moment
she
was
looking
towards
the
deserted
cricket
pitch
where
is
he
staying
now
she
asked
i
do
not
know
he
answered
i
have
warned
all
the
likely
people
not
to
receive
him
and
i
have
told
him
too
that
he
will
only
get
your
tenants
into
trouble
if
he
tries
to
get
lodgings
here
i
should
like
she
said
to
speak
to
him
perhaps
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
ask
him
to
step
this
way
for
a
moment
stephen
departed
wondering
deyes
was
watching
his
hostess
with
an
air
of
covert
amusement
do
you
continue
the
warfare
he
asked
or
has
the
young
man
prowess
softened
your
heart
wilhelmina
raised
her
parasol
and
looked
steadily
at
her
questioner
warfare
is
scarcely
the
word
is
it
she
remarked
carelessly
i
have
no
personal
objection
to
the
young
man
they
watched
him
crossing
the
field
towards
them
notwithstanding
his
recent
exertions
he
walked
lightly
and
without
any
sign
of
fatigue
deyes
looked
curiously
at
the
crest
upon
the
cap
which
he
was
carrying
in
his
hand
magdalen
he
muttered
your
missioner
grows
more
interesting
wilhelmina
leaned
forwards
her
face
was
inscrutable
and
her
greeting
devoid
of
cordiality
so
you
have
decided
to
teach
my
people
cricket
instead
of
morals
macheson
she
remarked
the
two
he
answered
pleasantly
are
not
incompatible
wilhelmina
frowned
i
hope
she
said
that
you
have
abandoned
your
idea
of
holding
meetings
in
the
village
certainly
not
he
answered
i
will
begin
next
week
you
understand
she
said
calmly
that
i
consider
you
as
a
missioner
an
intruder
here
those
of
my
people
who
attend
your
services
will
incur
my
displeasure
madam
he
answered
i
do
not
believe
that
you
will
visit
it
upon
them
but
i
will
she
interrupted
ruthlessly
you
are
young
and
know
little
of
the
world
you
have
not
yet
learnt
the
truth
of
one
of
the
oldest
of
proverbs
that
it
is
well
to
let
well
alone
it
is
a
sop
for
the
idle
that
proverb
he
answered
it
is
the
motto
for
the
great
army
of
those
who
drift
i
have
been
making
inquiries
she
said
i
find
that
my
villagers
are
contented
and
prosperous
there
are
no
signs
of
vice
in
the
place
there
is
such
a
thing
he
answered
as
being
too
prosperous
the
person
in
such
a
state
takes
life
for
granted
religion
is
a
thing
he
hears
about
but
fails
to
realize
he
has
no
need
of
it
he
becomes
like
the
prize
cattle
in
your
park
he
has
a
mind
but
has
forgotten
how
to
use
it
she
looked
at
him
steadily
perhaps
a
trifle
insolently
how
old
are
you
mr
macheson
she
asked
he
answered
with
a
slight
flush
you
are
young
to
make
yourself
the
judge
of
such
things
as
these
you
will
do
a
great
deal
of
mischief
i
am
afraid
before
you
are
old
enough
to
realize
it
to
awaken
those
who
sleep
in
the
daytime
is
that
mischief
he
asked
it
is
she
answered
deliberately
when
you
are
older
you
will
realize
it
sleep
is
the
best
he
bent
towards
her
the
light
in
his
eyes
had
blazed
out
you
know
in
your
heart
he
said
that
it
is
not
true
you
have
brains
and
you
are
as
much
of
an
artist
as
your
fettered
life
permits
you
to
be
you
know
very
well
that
knowledge
is
best
do
you
believe
she
answered
that
i
i
take
myself
not
personally
but
as
a
type
am
as
happy
as
they
are
she
moved
her
parasol
to
where
the
village
lay
beyond
the
trees
he
hesitated
madam
he
answered
gravely
i
know
too
little
of
your
life
to
answer
your
question
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
for
a
moment
her
parasol
hid
her
face
we
are
quite
la
are
we
not
my
dear
peggy
she
remarked
with
a
curious
little
laugh
philosophy
upon
the
village
green
gilbert
tell
them
to
drive
on
she
turned
deliberately
to
macheson
come
and
convert
us
instead
she
said
we
need
it
more
i
do
not
doubt
it
madam
he
answered
good
afternoon
the
carriage
drove
off
macheson
obeying
an
impulse
which
he
did
not
recognize
watched
it
till
it
was
out
of
sight
at
the
bend
wilhelmina
deliberately
turned
in
her
seat
and
saw
him
standing
there
she
waved
her
parasol
in
ironical
farewell
and
macheson
walked
back
to
the
tent
with
burning
cheeks
chapter
vii
an
undernote
of
music
a
great
dinner
party
had
come
to
an
end
and
the
of
the
county
bowed
low
over
the
cold
hand
of
his
departing
guest
in
whose
honour
it
had
been
given
a
distant
relationship
gave
lord
westerdean
privileges
upon
which
he
would
willingly
have
improved
you
are
leaving
us
early
wilhelmina
he
murmured
reproachfully
how
can
i
expect
to
keep
my
other
guests
if
you
desert
us
wilhelmina
withdrew
the
hand
and
nodded
her
other
farewells
the
heat
of
the
summer
evening
had
brought
every
one
out
from
the
the
hall
doors
stood
open
those
of
the
guests
who
were
not
playing
bridge
or
billiards
were
outside
upon
the
terrace
some
had
wandered
into
the
gardens
my
dear
leslie
she
said
as
she
stood
upon
the
broad
steps
you
are
losing
your
habit
of
gallantry
a
year
ago
you
would
not
have
ventured
to
suggest
that
in
my
absence
the
coming
or
going
of
your
other
guests
could
matter
a
straw
you
know
very
well
that
it
does
he
answered
dropping
his
voice
you
know
very
well
she
interrupted
calmly
i
will
not
be
made
love
to
i
am
not
in
the
humour
for
it
he
looked
down
at
her
curiously
he
was
a
man
of
exceptional
height
thin
grey
still
handsome
an
whose
career
had
he
chosen
to
follow
it
would
have
been
a
brilliant
one
wealth
and
immense
estates
had
thrust
their
burdens
upon
him
however
and
he
was
content
to
be
the
most
popular
man
in
his
county
there
is
nothing
the
matter
he
asked
anxiously
she
shook
her
head
you
are
well
he
persisted
dropping
his
voice
absolutely
she
answered
it
is
not
that
it
is
a
mood
i
used
to
welcome
moods
as
an
escape
from
the
ruts
i
suppose
i
am
getting
too
old
for
them
now
he
shook
his
head
i
wonder
he
said
if
the
world
really
knows
how
young
you
are
do
she
interrupted
with
a
shudder
i
have
outlived
my
years
a
motor
omnibus
and
a
small
victoria
came
round
from
the
stables
the
party
from
thorpe
began
slowly
to
assemble
upon
the
steps
i
am
going
in
the
victoria
alone
she
said
resting
her
fingers
upon
his
arm
do
you
envy
me
i
envy
the
vacant
place
he
answered
sadly
is
this
desire
for
solitude
somewhat
of
a
new
departure
though
perhaps
she
admitted
i
am
rather
looking
forward
to
my
drive
as
we
came
here
the
whole
country
seemed
like
a
great
garden
of
perfumes
and
beautiful
places
that
is
why
i
had
them
telephone
for
a
carriage
there
are
times
when
i
hate
motoring
he
broke
off
a
cluster
of
pink
roses
and
placed
them
in
her
hands
if
your
thoughts
must
needs
fill
the
empty
seat
he
whispered
as
he
bent
over
her
for
his
final
adieux
remember
my
claims
i
beg
perhaps
my
thoughts
might
even
meet
yours
she
laughed
under
her
breath
but
the
light
in
his
eyes
was
unanswered
perhaps
she
answered
it
is
a
night
for
thoughts
and
dreams
this
even
i
may
drift
into
sentiment
good
night
such
a
charming
evening
the
carriage
rolled
smoothly
down
the
avenue
from
the
great
house
over
which
she
might
so
easily
have
reigned
and
turned
into
the
road
a
few
minutes
later
the
flashed
by
afterwards
there
was
solitude
for
it
was
already
past
midnight
gilbert
deyes
looked
thoughtfully
out
at
the
carriage
from
his
place
in
the
car
he
had
begged
very
hard
for
him
for
that
empty
seat
of
what
is
it
a
sign
he
asked
when
a
woman
seeks
solitude
lady
peggy
shrugged
her
shoulders
wilhelmina
is
tired
of
us
all
i
suppose
she
remarked
she
gets
like
that
sometimes
then
of
what
is
it
a
sign
he
persisted
when
a
woman
tires
of
people
like
us
lady
peggy
yawned
in
a
woman
of
more
primitive
instincts
she
said
it
would
mean
an
affair
but
wilhelmina
has
outgrown
all
that
she
is
the
only
woman
of
our
acquaintance
of
whom
one
would
dare
to
say
it
but
i
honestly
believe
that
to
wilhelmina
men
are
like
puppets
was
she
born
i
wonder
with
ice
in
her
veins
one
wonders
deyes
remarked
softly
a
woman
like
that
is
always
something
of
a
mystery
by
the
bye
was
there
a
whisper
of
something
the
year
she
lived
in
florence
people
have
talked
of
her
of
course
lady
peggy
answered
in
florence
a
woman
without
a
lover
is
like
a
child
without
toys
to
be
virtuous
there
is
the
one
offence
which
society
does
not
pardon
i
believe
deyes
said
that
a
lover
would
bore
wilhelmina
terribly
why
the
dickens
does
she
marry
leslie
austin
asked
opening
his
eyes
for
a
moment
too
obvious
deyes
murmured
some
day
i
ca
help
fancying
that
she
will
give
us
all
a
shock
a
mile
or
more
behind
the
lady
with
ice
in
her
veins
leaned
back
amongst
the
cushions
of
her
carriage
drinking
in
with
a
keenness
of
appreciation
which
surprised
even
herself
the
beauties
of
the
still
hot
night
the
moon
was
as
yet
barely
risen
in
the
half
light
the
country
and
the
hills
beyond
with
their
tumbled
masses
of
rock
seemed
unreal
of
strange
and
mysterious
outline
more
than
anything
she
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
softness
the
angles
were
gone
from
all
the
crude
places
it
was
peace
itself
which
had
settled
upon
the
land
peace
and
a
wonderful
silence
the
birds
had
long
ago
ceased
to
sing
no
breath
of
wind
was
abroad
to
stir
the
leaves
of
the
trees
all
the
cheerful
chorus
of
country
sounds
which
make
music
throughout
the
long
summer
day
had
ceased
once
when
a
barked
in
the
valley
far
below
she
started
the
sound
seemed
unreal
as
though
indeed
it
came
from
a
different
world
the
woman
in
the
carriage
looked
out
with
steady
tireless
eyes
upon
this
visionary
land
the
breath
of
the
honeysuckle
and
the
pleasant
odour
of
warm
hay
seemed
to
give
life
to
the
sensuous
joy
of
the
wonderful
night
she
herself
was
a
strange
being
to
be
abroad
in
these
quiet
lanes
her
only
wrap
was
a
long
robe
of
filmy
lace
which
she
had
thrown
back
so
that
her
shoulders
and
neck
with
its
collar
of
lustrous
pearls
were
bare
to
the
faint
breeze
which
only
their
own
progress
made
her
gleaming
dress
of
white
satin
undecorated
unadorned
fell
in
delicate
lines
about
her
limbs
no
wonder
that
the
only
person
whom
they
passed
a
belated
farmer
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
at
her
as
at
a
ghost
it
seemed
to
her
that
something
of
the
confusion
of
this
delightful
world
had
stolen
too
into
her
thoughts
all
day
long
she
had
been
conscious
of
it
there
was
something
alien
there
something
wholly
unrecognizable
she
felt
a
new
light
falling
upon
her
life
from
where
she
could
not
tell
only
she
knew
that
its
pitiless
routine
its
littleness
its
frantic
struggle
for
the
front
place
in
the
great
seemed
suddenly
to
stand
revealed
in
pitiful
colours
surely
it
belonged
to
some
other
woman
it
could
not
be
she
who
did
those
things
and
called
them
life
she
who
scarcely
knew
what
nerves
were
was
suddenly
afraid
some
change
was
coming
upon
her
she
felt
herself
caught
in
a
silent
current
she
was
being
carried
away
and
she
had
not
strength
to
resist
and
all
the
time
there
was
an
undernote
of
music
that
was
what
made
it
so
strange
the
light
that
was
falling
was
like
summer
rain
upon
the
bare
dry
places
she
was
conscious
of
a
new
vitality
a
new
life
and
she
feared
it
fancy
being
endowed
with
a
new
sense
in
the
midst
of
an
ordinary
existence
she
felt
like
that
it
was
unbelievable
and
yet
its
tumult
was
stirring
in
her
heart
was
rushing
through
her
veins
often
before
her
tired
eyes
had
rested
unmoved
upon
a
country
as
beautiful
as
this
even
the
mystery
of
this
half
light
was
no
new
thing
she
saw
farther
she
felt
the
throbbing
delight
of
the
wanderer
in
the
enchanted
land
the
pilgrim
who
hears
suddenly
the
angelus
bell
from
the
shrine
he
has
journeyed
so
far
to
visit
what
it
meant
she
could
not
she
dared
not
ask
herself
she
was
content
to
sit
there
her
eyes
wide
open
now
the
tired
lines
smoothed
from
her
forehead
her
face
like
the
face
of
an
eager
and
beautiful
child
no
one
of
her
world
would
have
recognized
her
as
she
travelled
that
night
through
the
perfumed
lanes
it
was
when
they
were
within
a
mile
or
two
of
home
that
an
awakening
came
they
had
turned
into
a
lonely
lane
leading
to
one
of
the
back
entrances
to
thorpe
and
were
climbing
a
somewhat
steep
hill
suddenly
the
horses
plunged
and
almost
stopped
she
leaned
forward
what
is
it
johnson
she
asked
the
man
touched
his
hat
the
shied
madam
at
the
light
in
the
trees
there
enough
to
frighten
too
her
eyes
followed
his
pointing
finger
a
few
yards
back
from
the
roadside
a
small
steady
light
was
burning
amongst
the
trees
what
is
it
she
asked
quickly
i
ca
say
madam
the
man
answered
it
looks
like
a
lantern
or
a
candle
or
something
of
that
sort
there
is
no
cottage
there
she
asked
the
man
shook
his
head
there
none
nearer
than
the
first
lodge
madam
he
answered
a
bit
of
a
shelter
there
higgs
the
keeper
built
it
for
a
watchman
can
i
take
care
of
the
horses
for
a
moment
while
you
go
and
see
what
it
is
she
asked
they
take
a
bit
of
holding
madam
the
man
answered
doubtfully
we
got
your
message
so
late
at
the
stables
or
i
should
have
had
a
second
man
wilhelmina
stepped
softly
out
into
the
road
i
will
go
myself
she
said
i
daresay
it
is
nothing
if
i
call
though
you
must
leave
the
horses
and
come
to
me
she
opened
the
gate
and
raising
her
skirts
with
both
hands
stepped
into
the
plantation
her
small
feet
fell
noiselessly
upon
the
thick
undergrowth
she
reached
the
entrance
of
the
shelter
without
making
any
sound
cautiously
she
peeped
in
her
eyes
grew
round
with
surprise
her
bosom
began
rapidly
to
rise
and
fall
it
was
macheson
who
lay
there
fast
asleep
he
had
fallen
asleep
evidently
whilst
reading
a
book
was
lying
by
his
side
and
a
covered
lantern
was
burning
by
his
left
shoulder
he
was
dressed
in
trousers
and
shirt
the
latter
was
open
at
the
throat
showing
its
outline
firm
and
white
and
his
regular
breathing
she
drew
a
step
nearer
and
leaned
over
him
curiously
enough
in
sleep
the
boyishness
of
his
face
was
less
apparent
the
straight
firm
mouth
rigidly
closed
was
the
mouth
of
a
man
his
limbs
in
repose
seemed
heavy
even
massive
especially
the
bare
arm
upon
which
his
head
was
resting
his
shirt
was
old
but
spotlessly
clean
his
socks
were
neatly
darned
in
many
places
he
occupied
nearly
the
whole
of
the
shelter
in
fact
one
foot
was
protruding
through
the
opening
in
the
corner
a
was
hanging
from
a
stick
and
a
few
simple
toilet
articles
were
spread
upon
the
ground
she
bent
more
closely
over
him
holding
her
breath
although
he
showed
no
signs
of
waking
her
senses
were
in
confusion
and
there
was
a
mist
before
her
eyes
an
unaccountable
impulse
was
urging
her
on
driving
her
as
it
seemed
into
incredible
folly
lower
and
lower
she
bent
till
her
hot
breath
fell
almost
upon
his
cheek
suddenly
he
stirred
she
started
back
after
all
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
but
the
moment
was
gone
she
moved
backwards
towards
the
opening
she
was
seized
now
with
sudden
fright
she
desired
to
escape
she
was
breathless
with
fear
the
fear
of
what
she
might
not
have
escaped
yet
in
the
midst
of
it
with
hot
trembling
fingers
she
loosened
the
roses
from
her
dress
and
dropped
them
by
his
side
then
she
fled
into
the
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
die
hard
they
are
proof
as
a
rule
against
these
fits
of
temporary
madness
wilhelmina
stepped
languidly
into
her
carriage
and
commanded
her
coachman
attention
johnson
she
said
i
found
a
poor
man
sleeping
there
there
is
no
necessity
for
him
to
be
disturbed
it
is
my
wish
that
you
do
not
mention
the
occurrence
to
any
one
to
any
one
at
all
you
understand
the
man
touched
his
hat
he
would
have
been
indeed
if
he
had
not
appreciated
the
note
of
finality
in
his
mistress
tone
his
horses
sprang
forward
and
a
few
minutes
later
turned
into
the
dark
avenue
which
led
to
the
house
chapter
viii
roses
macheson
woke
with
the
daylight
stiff
a
little
tired
and
haunted
with
the
consciousness
of
disturbing
dreams
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stretched
himself
then
he
saw
the
roses
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stared
at
them
incredulously
then
his
thoughts
flashed
backwards
where
or
how
had
he
become
possessed
of
them
a
few
seconds
were
sufficient
some
one
had
been
there
in
the
night
most
likely
a
woman
his
cheeks
burned
at
the
thought
he
stooped
and
took
them
hesitatingly
reverently
into
his
hand
to
him
they
represented
part
of
the
mystery
of
life
the
mystery
of
which
he
knew
so
little
soft
and
fragrant
the
touch
of
the
drooping
blossoms
was
like
fire
to
his
fingers
had
he
been
like
those
predecessors
of
his
in
the
days
of
the
puritans
he
would
have
cast
them
away
trampled
them
underfoot
he
would
have
seen
in
them
only
the
snare
of
the
evil
one
but
to
macheson
this
would
have
seemed
almost
like
sacrilege
they
were
beautiful
and
he
loved
beautiful
things
he
made
his
way
farther
into
the
plantation
to
where
the
trees
suddenly
opening
disclosed
a
small
disused
slate
quarry
the
water
in
which
was
kept
fresh
by
many
streams
stripping
off
his
clothes
he
plunged
into
the
deep
cool
depths
swimming
round
for
several
minutes
on
his
back
his
face
upturned
to
the
dim
blue
sky
then
he
dressed
in
the
ugly
black
suit
for
it
was
sunday
and
made
a
frugal
breakfast
boiling
the
water
for
his
coffee
over
a
small
and
all
the
time
he
kept
looking
at
the
roses
now
fresh
with
the
water
which
he
had
carefully
sprinkled
over
them
their
coming
seemed
to
him
to
whisper
of
beautiful
things
they
turned
his
thoughts
so
easily
into
that
world
of
poetry
and
sentiment
in
which
he
was
a
habitual
wanderer
yet
every
now
and
then
their
direct
significance
startled
almost
alarmed
some
one
had
actually
been
in
the
place
while
he
slept
and
had
retreated
without
disturbing
him
roses
do
not
drop
from
the
sky
and
of
gardens
there
were
none
close
at
hand
was
it
one
of
the
village
girls
who
had
seen
him
that
afternoon
his
cheeks
reddened
at
the
thought
perhaps
he
had
better
leave
his
shelter
another
time
if
she
came
she
might
not
steal
away
so
quietly
scandal
would
injure
his
work
he
must
run
no
risks
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
thrust
that
other
that
impossibly
sweet
thought
he
would
not
suffer
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
it
after
breakfast
he
walked
for
an
hour
or
so
across
the
hills
watching
the
early
mists
roll
away
in
the
valleys
and
the
sunlight
settle
down
upon
the
land
it
was
a
morning
of
silence
this
that
peculiar
mysterious
silence
which
only
the
first
day
of
the
week
seems
to
bring
the
fields
were
empty
of
toilers
the
harvest
was
stayed
from
its
nest
amongst
the
hills
he
could
just
hear
carried
on
the
bosom
of
a
favouring
breeze
the
single
note
of
a
monastery
bell
whose
harshness
not
even
distance
or
its
pleasant
journey
across
the
open
country
could
modify
macheson
listened
to
it
for
a
moment
and
sat
down
upon
a
rock
on
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
the
hills
he
was
climbing
below
him
the
country
stretched
like
a
piece
of
brilliant
patchwork
thorpe
with
its
many
chimneys
and
stately
avenues
and
the
village
hidden
by
a
grove
of
elms
was
like
a
cool
oasis
in
the
midst
of
the
landscape
behind
the
hills
ran
rockier
and
wilder
culminating
in
a
bleak
stretch
of
country
in
the
middle
of
which
was
the
monastery
macheson
looked
downwards
at
thorpe
with
the
faint
clang
of
that
single
bell
in
his
ears
the
frown
on
his
forehead
deepened
as
the
rush
of
thoughts
took
insistent
hold
of
him
for
a
young
man
blessed
with
vigorous
health
free
from
all
material
anxieties
and
with
the
world
before
him
macheson
found
life
an
uncommonly
serious
matter
only
a
few
years
ago
he
had
left
the
university
with
a
brilliant
degree
a
splendid
athletic
record
and
a
host
of
friends
what
to
do
with
his
life
that
was
the
problem
which
pressingly
confronted
him
he
recognized
in
himself
certain
gifts
inevitably
to
be
considered
in
this
choice
he
was
possessed
of
a
deep
religious
sense
an
immense
sympathy
for
his
fellows
and
a
passion
for
the
beautiful
in
life
from
which
the
physical
side
was
by
no
means
absent
how
to
find
a
career
which
would
satisfy
such
varying
qualities
a
life
of
pleasure
unless
it
were
shared
by
his
fellows
did
not
appeal
to
him
at
all
personal
ambition
he
was
destitute
of
his
religion
he
was
very
well
aware
was
not
the
sort
which
would
enable
him
to
enter
with
any
prospect
of
happiness
any
of
the
established
churches
for
a
time
he
had
travelled
and
had
come
back
with
only
one
definite
idea
in
his
mind
chance
had
brought
him
on
his
return
into
contact
with
two
young
men
of
somewhat
similar
tastes
a
conversation
between
them
one
night
had
given
a
certain
definiteness
to
his
aims
he
recalled
it
to
himself
as
he
sat
looking
down
at
the
thin
blue
line
of
smoke
rising
from
the
chimneys
of
thorpe
to
use
one
life
for
others
he
had
repeated
thoughtfully
it
was
the
enthusiast
of
the
party
who
had
spoken
but
how
teach
them
to
avoid
like
filth
the
ugly
things
of
life
help
them
in
their
search
for
the
things
beautiful
what
are
the
things
beautiful
he
had
asked
do
they
mean
something
different
to
every
man
holderness
had
lifted
his
beautiful
head
the
boy
with
whom
he
had
played
at
school
the
friend
of
his
younger
life
the
christian
morality
he
had
answered
macheson
had
been
surprised
but
you
he
said
you
do
believe
anything
it
is
not
necessary
holderness
had
answered
it
is
a
matter
of
the
intelligence
as
an
artist
if
i
might
dare
to
call
myself
one
i
say
that
the
christian
life
if
honestly
lived
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
of
all
the
ages
macheson
walked
down
to
the
village
with
the
memory
of
those
words
still
in
his
brain
the
bell
was
ringing
for
service
from
the
queer
church
the
villagers
were
coming
down
the
lane
in
little
groups
macheson
found
himself
one
of
a
small
knot
of
people
who
stood
reverently
on
one
side
with
doffed
hats
just
by
the
wooden
porch
he
looked
up
suddenly
realizing
the
cause
a
small
vehicle
something
between
a
and
a
miniature
carriage
drawn
by
a
fat
sleek
pony
was
turning
into
the
lane
from
one
of
the
splendid
avenues
which
led
to
the
house
a
boy
led
the
pony
a
footman
marched
behind
wilhelmina
in
a
plain
white
muslin
dress
and
a
black
hat
was
slowly
preparing
to
descend
she
smiled
languidly
but
pleasantly
enough
at
the
line
of
curtseying
women
and
men
with
doffed
hats
the
note
of
feudalism
which
their
almost
reverential
attitudes
suggested
appealed
irresistibly
to
macheson
sense
of
humour
he
too
formed
one
of
them
he
too
doffed
his
hat
his
greeting
however
was
different
her
eyes
swept
by
him
unseeing
his
pleasant
good
morning
was
unheeded
she
even
touched
her
skirt
with
her
fingers
as
though
afraid
lest
it
might
brush
against
him
in
passing
with
tired
graceful
footsteps
she
passed
into
the
cool
church
leaving
him
to
admire
against
his
will
the
slim
perfection
of
her
figure
the
wonderful
carriage
of
her
small
but
perfect
head
he
followed
with
the
others
presently
and
found
a
single
seat
close
to
the
door
the
service
began
almost
at
once
a
very
beautiful
service
in
its
way
for
the
organ
a
present
from
the
lady
of
the
manor
was
perfectly
played
and
the
preacher
voice
was
clear
and
as
sweet
as
a
boy
macheson
however
was
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
from
the
open
door
he
heard
the
soft
whispering
of
the
west
wind
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
found
the
simple
but
dignified
ritual
unconvincing
he
was
haunted
by
the
sense
of
some
impending
disaster
when
the
prayers
came
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
remained
there
even
then
he
could
not
collect
himself
he
was
praying
to
an
unknown
god
for
protection
against
some
nameless
evil
he
knew
quite
well
that
the
words
he
muttered
were
vain
words
through
the
stained
glass
windows
the
sunlight
fell
in
a
subdued
golden
stream
upon
the
glowing
hair
the
gracefully
bent
head
of
the
woman
who
sat
alone
in
the
deep
square
pew
she
too
seemed
to
be
praying
macheson
got
up
and
softly
but
abruptly
stole
from
the
church
up
into
the
hills
as
far
away
as
high
up
as
possible
a
day
of
sabbath
calm
this
macheson
with
the
fire
in
his
veins
and
a
sharp
pain
in
his
side
climbed
as
a
man
possessed
he
too
was
fleeing
from
the
unknown
he
was
many
miles
away
when
down
in
the
valley
at
thorpe
some
one
spoke
of
him
by
the
bye
gilbert
deyes
remarked
looking
across
the
luncheon
table
at
his
hostess
when
does
this
athletic
young
missioner
of
yours
begin
his
work
of
regeneration
wilhelmina
raised
her
eyebrows
evening
i
believe
she
answered
he
is
going
to
speak
at
the
i
fancy
that
his
audience
will
consist
chiefly
of
the
children
and
adnith
chickens
ca
understand
austin
remarked
why
a
chap
who
can
play
cricket
like
that
he
did
lay
on
to
too
can
be
such
a
crank
he
is
very
young
wilhelmina
remarked
composedly
and
i
fancy
that
he
must
be
a
little
mad
i
hope
that
thorpe
will
teach
him
a
lesson
he
needs
it
you
do
not
anticipate
then
deyes
remarked
that
his
labours
here
will
be
crowned
with
success
he
wo
get
a
soul
to
hear
him
stephen
hurd
replied
confidently
the
villagers
all
know
what
miss
thinks
of
his
coming
here
it
will
be
quite
sufficient
wilhelmina
lit
a
cigarette
and
rose
to
her
feet
let
us
hope
so
she
remarked
drily
please
remember
all
of
you
that
this
is
the
palace
of
ease
do
exactly
what
you
like
all
of
you
till
five
i
shall
be
ready
for
bridge
then
lady
peggy
rose
briskly
no
doubt
about
what
i
shall
do
she
remarked
i
going
to
bed
deyes
smiled
i
he
said
shall
spend
the
afternoon
in
the
rose
garden
i
need
development
wilhelmina
looked
at
him
questioningly
please
do
be
inexplicable
she
begged
it
is
too
hot
roses
and
sentiment
he
declared
are
supposed
to
go
together
i
want
to
grow
into
accord
with
my
surroundings
wilhelmina
was
silent
for
a
moment
if
you
have
found
sentiment
here
she
said
carelessly
you
must
have
dug
deep
on
the
contrary
he
answered
i
have
scarcely
scratched
the
surface
stephen
hurd
looked
uneasily
from
deyes
to
his
hostess
never
altogether
comfortable
although
eager
to
accept
the
most
casually
offered
invitation
to
thorpe
he
had
always
the
idea
that
the
most
commonplace
remark
contained
an
innuendo
purposely
concealed
from
him
deyes
he
remarked
looks
mysterious
deyes
glanced
at
him
through
his
eyeglass
it
is
a
subtle
neighbourhood
he
said
by
the
bye
hurd
have
you
ever
seen
the
rose
gardens
at
carrow
never
hurd
replied
enviously
i
have
heard
that
they
are
very
beautiful
wilhelmina
passed
out
the
gardens
are
beautiful
she
said
looking
back
but
the
roses
are
like
all
other
roses
they
fade
quickly
till
five
all
of
you
chapter
ix
summer
lightning
stephen
hurd
walked
into
the
room
which
he
and
his
father
shared
as
a
sanctum
half
office
half
study
hurd
senior
was
attired
in
his
conventional
sabbath
garb
the
same
black
coat
of
hard
dull
material
and
dark
grey
trousers
in
which
he
had
attended
church
for
more
years
than
many
of
the
villagers
could
remember
stephen
on
the
other
hand
was
attired
in
evening
clothes
of
the
latest
cut
his
white
waistcoat
had
come
from
a
london
tailor
and
his
white
tie
had
cost
him
considerable
pains
his
father
looked
him
over
with
expressionless
face
you
are
going
to
the
house
again
stephen
he
asked
calmly
i
am
asked
to
dine
there
father
he
answered
sorry
to
leave
you
alone
i
have
no
objection
to
being
alone
hurd
answered
i
think
that
you
know
that
you
lunched
there
did
you
stephen
nodded
miss
asked
me
as
we
came
out
of
church
he
answered
you
play
cards
the
directness
of
the
question
allowed
of
no
evasion
stephen
flushed
as
he
answered
they
play
bridge
i
may
be
asked
to
join
it
is
a
sort
of
whist
you
know
so
i
understand
the
older
man
remarked
i
have
no
remark
to
make
concerning
that
manners
change
i
suppose
with
the
generations
you
are
young
and
i
am
old
i
have
never
sought
to
impose
my
prejudices
upon
you
you
have
seen
more
of
the
world
than
i
ever
did
perhaps
you
have
found
wisdom
there
stephen
was
not
at
his
ease
i
do
know
about
that
sir
he
answered
of
course
sunday
kept
so
strictly
as
it
used
to
be
i
like
a
quiet
day
myself
but
pretty
dull
here
usually
and
i
did
think
it
would
be
wise
to
refuse
an
invitation
from
miss
perhaps
not
hurd
answered
on
the
other
hand
i
might
remind
you
that
during
the
forty
years
during
which
i
have
been
agent
to
this
estate
i
have
never
accepted
beyond
a
glass
of
wine
the
hospitality
offered
to
me
by
miss
father
and
grandfather
and
by
the
young
lady
herself
it
is
not
according
to
my
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
i
am
a
servant
of
the
owner
of
these
estates
i
prefer
to
discharge
my
duties
honestly
and
capably
as
a
servant
stephen
frowned
at
his
reflection
in
the
glass
he
did
not
feel
in
the
least
like
a
servant
that
rather
an
view
dad
he
declared
it
may
be
his
father
answered
in
any
case
i
do
not
seek
to
impose
it
upon
you
you
are
free
to
come
and
go
according
to
your
judgment
but
you
are
young
and
i
can
not
see
you
expose
yourself
to
trouble
without
some
warning
miss
is
not
a
lady
whom
it
is
wise
for
you
to
see
too
much
of
the
directness
of
this
speech
took
the
young
man
aback
i
she
seems
very
pleasant
and
gracious
he
faltered
not
even
to
you
his
father
continued
gravely
can
i
betray
the
knowledge
of
such
things
as
have
come
under
my
notice
as
the
servant
of
these
estates
and
this
young
lady
her
father
was
a
fine
gentleman
as
all
the
have
been
her
mother
came
from
a
noble
but
degenerate
french
family
i
who
live
here
a
life
without
change
who
mark
time
for
the
years
and
watch
the
striplings
become
old
men
see
many
things
and
see
them
truthfully
the
evil
seed
of
her
mother
family
is
in
this
young
woman
blood
she
lives
without
a
chaperon
without
companionship
as
she
pleases
and
to
please
herself
only
stephen
frowned
irritably
his
father
cold
measured
words
were
like
drops
of
ice
but
father
he
protested
she
is
a
leader
of
society
she
goes
to
court
and
you
see
her
name
at
the
very
best
places
if
there
was
anything
wrong
about
her
she
would
be
received
like
that
i
know
nothing
about
society
or
its
requirements
his
father
answered
she
has
brains
and
wealth
and
she
is
a
woman
therefore
i
suppose
the
world
is
on
her
side
i
have
said
all
that
i
wish
to
say
you
can
perhaps
conjecture
the
reason
of
my
speaking
at
all
she
would
take
the
trouble
to
make
a
fool
of
me
stephen
answered
bitterly
i
just
happen
to
make
up
a
number
that
all
i
am
glad
that
you
understand
the
young
lady
so
well
his
father
answered
before
you
go
will
you
be
good
enough
to
pass
me
the
bible
and
my
spectacles
and
let
mary
know
that
stuart
will
be
in
to
supper
with
me
stephen
obeyed
in
silence
he
remembered
the
time
not
so
long
ago
when
he
would
have
been
required
to
seat
himself
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fireplace
with
a
smaller
bible
in
his
hand
and
read
word
for
word
with
his
father
his
mind
went
back
to
those
days
as
he
walked
slowly
up
the
great
avenue
to
the
house
picking
his
steps
carefully
lest
he
should
mar
the
brilliancy
of
his
boots
he
compared
that
old
time
curiously
with
the
evening
which
was
now
before
him
the
round
table
drawn
into
the
midst
of
the
splendid
an
oasis
of
exquisitely
shaded
light
and
colour
lady
peggy
with
her
daring
toilette
and
beautiful
white
shoulders
deyes
with
his
face
and
flippant
tongue
the
mistress
of
thorpe
herself
more
subdued
perhaps
in
dress
and
speech
and
yet
with
the
mystery
of
eyes
and
lips
wherein
was
always
the
fascination
of
the
unknown
more
than
ever
that
night
stephen
hurd
felt
himself
to
be
her
helpless
slave
all
his
former
amours
seemed
suddenly
empty
and
vulgar
things
she
came
late
into
the
her
greeting
was
as
carelessly
kind
as
usual
there
was
no
perceptible
difference
in
her
manner
of
speech
yet
his
observation
of
her
was
so
intense
that
he
found
readily
the
signs
of
some
subtle
indefinable
change
a
change
which
began
with
her
toilette
and
ended
ah
as
yet
there
was
no
ending
her
gown
of
soft
white
silk
was
daring
as
a
french
modiste
could
make
it
but
its
simplicity
was
almost
she
wore
a
string
of
pearls
no
earrings
no
rings
and
her
hair
was
arranged
low
down
almost
like
a
schoolgirl
she
had
more
colour
than
usual
a
temporary
restlessness
seemed
to
have
taken
the
place
of
her
customary
easy
languor
what
did
it
mean
he
asked
himself
breathlessly
was
it
deyes
impossible
for
deyes
himself
was
a
watcher
a
thin
smile
parting
sometimes
the
close
set
lips
of
his
white
face
after
all
how
hopelessly
at
sea
he
was
he
knew
nothing
of
her
life
of
which
these
few
days
at
thorpe
were
merely
an
interlude
she
might
have
lovers
by
the
score
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
he
was
vain
but
he
was
not
wholly
a
fool
she
talked
more
than
usual
at
but
afterwards
she
spoke
of
a
headache
and
sat
on
the
of
the
library
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
her
eyes
half
closed
when
the
bridge
table
was
laid
out
she
turned
her
head
languidly
i
will
come
in
in
the
next
rubber
she
said
you
four
can
start
they
obeyed
her
of
course
but
lady
peggy
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
she
had
no
fancy
for
stephen
bridge
and
they
cut
together
wilhelmina
waited
until
the
soft
fall
of
the
cards
had
ceased
and
the
hands
were
being
examined
then
with
a
graceful
movement
she
slipped
out
of
the
window
and
away
into
the
shadows
no
signs
of
her
headache
were
left
she
passed
swiftly
along
a
narrow
path
bordered
by
gigantic
shrubs
until
she
reached
a
small
iron
gate
here
for
the
first
time
she
paused
for
several
moments
she
listened
there
was
no
sound
from
the
great
house
whose
outline
she
could
barely
see
but
whose
long
row
of
lights
stretched
out
behind
her
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
along
the
lane
beyond
the
gate
there
was
no
one
in
sight
no
sound
she
lifted
the
latch
and
passed
through
for
a
summer
night
it
was
unusually
dark
all
day
the
heat
had
been
almost
tropical
and
now
the
sky
was
clouded
over
and
a
south
wind
dry
and
unrefreshing
was
moving
against
the
tall
elms
every
few
seconds
the
heavens
were
ablaze
with
summer
lightning
once
the
breathless
silence
was
broken
by
a
low
rumble
of
distant
thunder
she
reached
the
end
of
the
lane
before
her
another
gate
led
out
on
to
a
hill
strewn
with
fragments
of
rocks
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
backwards
she
was
suddenly
conscious
that
her
heart
was
beating
fast
the
piquant
sense
of
adventure
with
which
she
had
started
had
given
place
to
a
rarer
and
more
exciting
turmoil
of
the
senses
her
breath
was
coming
short
as
though
she
had
been
running
the
silence
seemed
more
complete
than
ever
she
lifted
her
foot
and
felt
the
white
satin
slipper
it
was
perfectly
dry
there
was
no
dew
and
as
yet
no
rain
had
fallen
she
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
and
passed
through
the
footpath
skirted
the
side
of
a
plantation
and
she
followed
it
closely
keeping
under
the
shelter
of
the
hedge
every
now
and
then
a
rabbit
started
up
almost
from
under
her
feet
and
rushed
into
the
hedge
the
spinney
itself
seemed
alive
with
birds
and
animals
startled
by
her
light
footsteps
in
the
shelter
which
they
had
sought
disturbed
too
by
their
instinct
of
the
coming
storm
her
footsteps
grew
swifter
she
was
committed
now
to
her
enterprise
vague
though
it
had
seemed
to
her
she
passed
through
a
second
gate
into
a
ragged
wood
and
along
a
winding
path
into
a
country
road
she
turned
slowly
up
the
hill
her
breath
was
coming
faster
than
ever
now
what
folly
transcendental
exquisite
her
footsteps
grew
slower
she
kept
to
the
side
of
the
hedge
raising
her
skirts
a
little
for
the
grass
was
long
a
few
yards
farther
was
the
gate
the
soft
swish
of
her
silken
draperies
as
she
stole
along
became
a
clearly
recognizable
sound
against
the
background
of
intense
silence
macheson
had
been
leaning
against
a
tree
just
inside
he
opened
the
gate
she
stepped
almost
into
his
arms
her
white
face
was
suddenly
illuminated
by
the
soft
blaze
of
summer
lightning
which
poured
from
the
sky
he
had
no
time
to
move
to
realize
he
felt
her
hands
upon
his
cheek
his
face
drawn
downwards
her
lips
soft
and
burning
pressed
against
his
for
one
long
exquisite
second
and
then
the
darkness
once
more
and
his
arms
were
empty
chapter
x
the
still
figure
in
the
chair
with
upraised
skirts
and
feet
that
flashed
like
silver
across
the
turf
and
amongst
the
bracken
wilhelmina
flew
homewards
once
more
her
heart
was
like
the
heart
of
a
girl
her
breath
came
in
little
sobs
mingled
with
laughter
the
ground
beneath
her
feet
was
buoyant
as
the
clouds
she
had
no
fear
of
being
pursued
least
of
anything
in
the
world
did
she
desire
it
the
passion
of
a
woman
is
controlled
always
by
her
sentiment
it
seemed
to
her
that
that
breathless
episode
was
in
itself
an
epic
she
would
not
for
worlds
have
added
to
it
have
altered
it
in
any
shape
or
form
a
moment
lingering
might
so
easily
have
spoilt
everything
had
he
attempted
to
play
either
the
prude
or
the
lothario
the
delicate
flavour
would
have
passed
away
from
the
adventure
which
had
set
her
heart
beating
once
more
and
sent
the
blood
singing
so
sweetly
through
her
veins
so
she
sped
through
the
darkness
leaving
fragments
of
lace
upon
the
thorns
like
some
beautiful
bird
escaped
from
long
captivity
rushing
through
a
strange
world
before
she
reached
the
grounds
the
storm
came
there
was
a
crash
of
thunder
which
seemed
to
tear
apart
the
heavens
above
and
then
the
big
raindrops
began
to
fall
upon
her
bare
shoulders
and
her
clothes
as
light
and
airy
as
butterfly
wings
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
ruin
of
a
paquin
gown
without
a
thought
of
regret
she
even
laughed
softly
with
pleasure
as
she
lifted
her
burning
face
to
the
cool
sweet
deluge
and
lessened
her
pace
in
the
avenue
walking
with
her
hands
behind
her
and
her
head
still
upraised
it
was
a
wonderful
night
this
she
had
found
something
of
her
lost
girlhood
she
reached
the
house
at
last
and
stole
through
the
hall
like
a
truant
schoolgirl
her
shoes
were
nothing
but
pulp
her
dress
clung
to
her
limbs
like
a
grey
everywhere
on
the
oak
floor
and
splendid
rugs
she
left
a
trail
of
wet
on
tiptoe
she
stole
up
the
stairs
looking
guiltily
around
yet
with
demure
laughter
in
her
glowing
eyes
she
met
only
one
amazed
servant
whom
she
dispatched
at
once
for
her
own
maid
in
the
she
began
to
strip
off
her
clothes
even
before
hortense
who
loved
her
could
effect
a
breathless
entrance
eh
madame
madame
the
girl
exclaimed
with
uplifted
hands
wilhelmina
stopped
her
laughing
it
all
right
hortense
she
exclaimed
gaily
i
was
out
in
the
grounds
and
got
caught
in
the
storm
turn
on
the
hot
water
and
cut
these
laces
so
to
hortense
the
affair
was
a
tragedy
her
mistress
indifference
could
not
lessen
it
madame
she
declared
the
gown
is
ruined
a
divine
creation
madame
has
never
looked
so
well
in
anything
else
then
i
am
glad
i
wore
it
was
the
astonishing
reply
quick
quick
quick
hortense
get
me
into
the
bath
and
bring
me
some
wine
and
biscuits
i
am
hungry
i
do
think
i
could
have
eaten
any
dinner
hortense
worked
with
nimble
fingers
but
her
eyes
at
every
opportunity
were
studying
her
mistress
face
was
it
the
english
rain
which
could
soften
and
beautify
like
this
madame
was
brilliant
and
so
young
such
a
colour
such
a
fire
in
the
eyes
madame
laughed
as
she
thrust
her
from
the
room
the
wine
hortense
and
the
biscuits
no
sandwiches
i
die
of
hunger
and
send
word
to
the
library
that
i
have
been
caught
in
the
storm
and
must
change
my
clothes
but
shall
be
down
presently
so
she
found
them
an
hour
later
just
finishing
a
rubber
their
languid
upon
a
curiously
played
hand
was
broken
off
upon
her
entrance
they
made
remarks
about
the
storm
and
her
had
she
been
far
from
shelter
was
she
not
terrified
by
the
lightning
lady
peggy
remembered
her
gown
deyes
alone
was
silent
she
felt
him
watching
her
all
the
time
taking
cold
note
of
her
brilliant
colour
the
softer
light
in
her
eyes
she
felt
that
he
saw
her
as
she
was
a
woman
suddenly
set
free
even
though
for
a
few
short
hours
she
had
broken
away
from
them
all
and
she
gloried
in
it
she
played
bridge
later
brilliantly
as
usual
and
with
success
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
faced
them
all
dear
guests
she
murmured
you
remember
the
condition
the
only
condition
upon
which
we
bestowed
our
company
upon
one
another
in
this
benighted
place
you
remember
it
was
agreed
that
when
you
were
bored
you
left
without
excuse
or
any
foolish
apologies
the
same
to
apply
to
your
hostess
my
dear
wilhelmina
lady
peggy
exclaimed
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
and
i
wo
go
i
not
due
anywhere
till
the
thirteenth
i
be
stranded
wilhelmina
laughed
you
foolish
woman
she
exclaimed
who
wants
you
to
go
you
shall
be
chatelaine
play
hostess
and
fill
the
place
if
you
like
only
you
must
have
leslie
over
more
than
twice
a
week
you
are
going
to
desert
us
deyes
asked
coolly
it
was
in
the
bond
was
it
she
answered
peggy
will
look
after
you
all
i
am
sure
you
mean
that
you
are
going
away
to
leave
thorpe
stephen
hurd
asked
abruptly
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him
he
was
sitting
a
little
outside
the
circle
an
attitude
typical
perhaps
of
his
position
there
the
change
in
her
tone
was
slight
indeed
but
it
was
sufficient
i
am
thinking
of
it
she
answered
you
gilbert
and
captain
austin
can
find
some
men
to
shoot
no
doubt
ask
any
one
you
like
peggy
will
see
about
some
women
for
you
i
draw
the
line
at
that
egremont
woman
anybody
else
this
is
a
blow
deyes
remarked
but
it
was
in
the
bond
nothing
will
move
me
from
here
till
the
seventeenth
unless
your
should
leave
do
we
meet
in
marienbad
i
am
not
sure
wilhelmina
answered
playing
idly
with
the
cards
i
feel
that
my
system
requires
something
more
soothing
i
hate
them
all
those
german
baths
lady
peggy
declared
ridiculous
places
every
one
of
them
after
all
you
see
wilhelmina
declared
illness
of
any
sort
is
a
species
of
uncleanliness
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
somewhere
where
people
are
healthy
or
at
least
not
so
disgustingly
frank
about
their
livers
why
not
stay
here
stephen
ventured
to
suggest
i
doubt
whether
any
one
in
thorpe
knows
what
a
liver
is
lady
peggy
exclaimed
wilhelmina
has
the
fever
i
can
see
it
in
her
face
is
it
the
thunder
i
wonder
deyes
walked
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
the
storm
was
over
but
the
rain
was
still
falling
a
soft
steady
downpour
the
cooler
air
which
swept
into
the
room
was
almost
faint
with
the
delicious
perfume
of
flowers
and
shrubs
bathed
in
the
refreshing
downpour
i
think
he
said
that
there
is
some
magic
abroad
did
you
meet
lucifer
walking
in
the
rose
garden
he
asked
turning
slightly
towards
his
hostess
the
storm
may
have
brought
him
even
here
neither
lucifer
nor
any
other
of
his
princely
fellows
she
answered
the
only
demon
is
here
she
touched
her
bosom
lightly
the
demon
of
unrest
it
is
not
i
alone
who
am
born
with
the
wanderer
curse
there
are
many
of
us
you
know
he
shook
his
head
you
have
not
the
writing
in
your
face
he
said
i
do
not
believe
that
you
are
one
of
the
accursed
at
all
she
was
standing
by
his
side
now
looking
out
into
the
velvety
darkness
her
eyes
challenged
his
well
you
have
the
look
of
one
who
has
found
what
she
has
sought
for
for
a
long
time
this
sounds
bald
but
it
is
as
near
to
truth
as
i
can
get
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
stood
by
his
side
listening
to
the
soft
constant
patter
of
the
rain
the
rumblings
of
the
dying
storm
one
has
moods
she
murmured
heaven
forbid
that
a
woman
should
be
without
them
he
answered
do
you
ever
feel
as
though
something
were
going
to
happen
she
asked
suddenly
often
he
answered
but
nothing
ever
does
lady
peggy
came
yawning
over
to
them
my
dear
she
said
i
feel
it
in
my
very
bones
i
firmly
believe
that
something
is
going
to
happen
to
every
one
of
us
i
have
a
most
mysterious
pricking
about
my
left
elbow
to
every
one
of
us
stephen
hurd
asked
idly
enough
to
every
one
of
us
she
answered
to
you
even
who
live
in
thorpe
remember
my
words
when
you
get
home
or
when
you
wake
in
the
morning
as
for
you
wilhelmina
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
have
not
already
met
with
your
adventure
deyes
lit
a
cigarette
let
us
remember
this
he
declared
in
a
week
time
we
will
compare
notes
stephen
hurd
stood
up
to
take
his
leave
you
are
really
going
soon
he
asked
as
he
bent
over
her
carelessly
offered
hand
as
soon
as
i
can
decide
where
to
go
to
she
answered
can
i
give
my
father
any
message
would
you
care
to
see
him
morning
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
it
is
not
necessary
she
answered
he
made
his
adieux
reluctantly
somehow
he
felt
that
the
night
had
not
been
a
success
she
was
going
away
very
likely
he
would
not
see
her
again
the
great
house
and
all
its
glories
would
be
closed
to
him
to
do
him
justice
he
thought
of
that
less
than
the
casual
manner
of
her
farewell
his
vanity
was
deeply
wounded
she
had
begun
by
being
so
gracious
no
wonder
that
he
had
lost
his
head
a
little
he
thought
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
something
had
occurred
to
alter
her
could
he
have
offended
in
any
way
he
walked
dejectedly
home
heedless
of
the
sodden
path
and
wet
grass
a
light
was
still
burning
in
the
study
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
turning
the
handle
entered
you
late
father
he
remarked
going
towards
the
cupboard
to
select
a
pipe
there
was
no
answer
the
still
figure
in
the
chair
never
moved
something
in
the
silence
struck
stephen
as
ominous
he
turned
abruptly
round
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
condition
of
the
room
a
chair
was
overturned
a
vase
of
flowers
spilt
upon
the
table
the
low
window
from
which
one
stepped
almost
into
the
village
street
was
wide
open
the
desk
in
front
of
the
motionless
figure
was
littered
all
over
with
papers
in
wild
confusion
stephen
with
a
low
cry
of
horror
crossed
the
room
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
father
shoulder
he
tried
to
speak
to
him
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
he
knew
very
well
that
there
could
be
no
reply
his
father
was
sitting
dead
in
his
chair
chapter
xi
the
baying
of
the
hounds
out
amongst
the
broken
fragments
of
the
storm
on
the
and
down
the
lane
macheson
sought
in
vain
by
physical
exertion
to
still
the
fever
which
burned
in
his
veins
nothing
he
could
do
was
able
to
disturb
that
wonderful
memory
to
lessen
for
an
instant
the
significance
of
those
few
amazing
seconds
the
world
of
women
all
the
lighter
and
quieter
joys
of
life
he
had
with
the
fierce
asceticism
of
the
young
reformer
thrust
so
resolutely
behind
him
but
he
had
never
imagined
anything
like
this
its
unexpectedness
had
swept
him
off
his
feet
the
memory
of
it
was
most
delicious
torture
sleep
he
dared
not
think
of
it
who
could
sleep
with
such
a
fire
in
his
blood
as
this
he
heard
the
storm
die
away
thunder
and
wind
and
rain
melted
into
the
deep
stillness
of
midnight
a
dim
moon
shone
behind
a
veil
of
mist
the
dripping
of
rain
from
the
trees
alone
remained
then
he
heard
a
footstep
coming
down
the
lane
his
first
wild
thought
was
that
she
had
returned
his
eyes
burned
their
way
through
the
darkness
soon
he
saw
that
it
was
a
man
who
came
unsteadily
but
swiftly
down
the
roadway
macheson
leaned
over
the
gate
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
disclose
himself
but
as
the
man
passed
he
was
stricken
with
a
sudden
consciousness
that
for
him
the
events
of
the
night
were
not
yet
over
this
was
no
villager
he
had
not
even
the
appearance
of
an
englishman
he
was
short
and
inclined
to
be
his
coat
collar
was
turned
up
and
a
tweed
cap
was
drawn
down
to
his
eyes
he
walked
with
uneven
footsteps
and
muttered
to
himself
words
that
sounded
like
words
of
prayer
only
they
were
in
some
foreign
language
macheson
accosted
him
hullo
he
said
have
you
lost
your
way
the
man
cried
out
and
then
stood
still
trembling
on
the
roadside
he
turned
a
white
scared
face
to
where
macheson
was
leaning
against
the
gate
who
is
that
he
cried
what
do
you
want
with
me
macheson
stepped
into
the
lane
nothing
at
all
he
answered
reassuringly
i
simply
thought
that
you
might
have
lost
your
way
these
are
lonely
parts
the
newcomer
drew
a
step
nearer
he
displayed
a
small
ragged
beard
a
face
and
narrow
very
bright
eyes
his
black
clothes
were
soaked
and
splashed
with
mud
i
want
a
railway
station
he
said
rapidly
where
is
the
nearest
macheson
pointed
into
the
valley
just
where
you
see
that
light
burning
he
answered
but
there
will
be
no
trains
till
the
morning
then
i
must
walk
the
man
declared
feverishly
how
far
is
it
to
nottingham
miles
macheson
answered
too
far
and
leicester
twelve
perhaps
but
you
are
walking
in
the
wrong
direction
the
man
turned
swiftly
round
point
towards
leicester
he
said
i
shall
find
my
way
macheson
pointed
across
the
trees
you
ca
miss
it
he
declared
climb
the
hill
till
you
get
to
a
road
with
telegraph
wires
turn
to
the
left
and
you
will
walk
into
leicester
for
some
reason
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
looking
earnestly
into
macheson
face
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
abruptly
i
am
close
to
where
i
am
staying
macheson
answered
just
in
the
wood
there
the
man
took
a
quick
step
forwards
and
then
reeled
his
hand
flew
to
his
side
he
was
attacked
by
sudden
faintness
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
macheson
outstretched
arm
god
he
muttered
it
is
finished
he
was
obviously
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
macheson
dragged
him
into
the
shelter
and
poured
brandy
between
his
teeth
he
revived
a
little
and
tried
to
rise
i
must
go
on
he
cried
i
dare
not
stay
here
the
terror
in
his
face
was
unmistakable
macheson
looked
at
him
gravely
you
had
better
stay
where
you
are
till
morning
he
said
you
are
not
in
a
fit
state
to
travel
the
man
had
raised
himself
upon
one
arm
he
looked
wildly
about
him
where
am
i
he
demanded
what
is
this
place
it
is
a
gamekeeper
shelter
macheson
answered
which
i
am
making
use
of
for
a
few
days
you
are
welcome
to
stay
here
until
the
morning
i
must
go
on
the
man
moaned
i
am
afraid
almost
as
he
uttered
the
words
he
fell
back
and
went
off
immediately
into
an
uneasy
doze
macheson
threw
his
remaining
rug
over
the
prostrate
figure
and
lighting
his
pipe
strolled
out
into
the
spinney
the
coming
filled
him
with
a
vague
sense
of
trouble
he
seemed
so
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
he
represented
an
alien
and
undesirable
note
a
note
almost
of
tragedy
all
the
time
in
his
broken
sleep
he
was
muttering
to
himself
once
or
twice
he
cried
out
in
terror
once
especially
macheson
turned
round
to
find
him
sitting
up
on
the
rug
his
brown
eyes
full
of
wild
fear
and
the
perspiration
running
down
his
face
a
stream
of
broken
words
flowed
from
his
lips
macheson
thrust
him
back
on
the
rug
go
to
sleep
he
said
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
after
that
the
man
slept
more
soundly
macheson
himself
dozed
for
an
hour
until
he
was
awakened
by
the
calling
of
the
birds
directly
he
opened
his
eyes
he
knew
that
something
had
happened
to
him
it
was
not
only
the
music
of
the
birds
there
was
a
strange
new
music
stirring
in
his
heart
the
pearly
light
in
the
eastern
sky
had
never
seemed
so
beautiful
never
surely
had
the
sunlight
streamed
down
upon
so
perfect
a
corner
of
the
earth
and
then
with
a
quick
rush
of
blood
to
his
cheeks
he
remembered
what
it
was
that
had
so
changed
the
world
he
lived
again
through
that
bewildering
moment
again
he
felt
the
delicious
warmth
of
her
presence
the
touch
of
her
hair
as
it
had
brushed
his
cheek
the
soft
passionate
pressure
of
her
lips
against
his
it
was
like
an
episode
from
a
fairy
story
there
was
something
so
delicate
so
altogether
fanciful
in
that
flying
visit
something
too
so
unbelievable
when
he
thought
of
her
as
the
mistress
of
thorpe
the
languid
insolent
woman
of
the
world
who
had
treated
him
so
coldly
then
a
movement
behind
reminded
him
of
his
strange
visitor
he
turned
round
the
man
was
already
on
his
feet
he
looked
better
for
his
sleep
but
the
wild
look
was
still
in
his
eyes
i
must
go
he
said
i
ought
to
have
started
before
thank
you
for
your
shelter
macheson
reached
out
for
his
spirit
lamp
wait
a
few
minutes
he
said
and
i
will
have
some
coffee
ready
the
man
hesitated
he
looked
sorely
in
need
of
something
of
the
sort
as
he
came
to
the
opening
of
the
shelter
the
trembling
seized
him
again
he
looked
furtively
out
as
though
he
feared
the
daylight
the
sunshine
and
the
bright
open
day
seemed
to
terrify
him
i
ought
to
have
gone
on
last
night
he
muttered
i
must
he
broke
off
his
sentence
macheson
too
had
turned
his
head
to
listen
what
is
that
he
asked
sharply
the
baying
of
dogs
macheson
answered
dogs
what
dogs
he
demanded
colonel
harvey
bloodhounds
the
man
face
was
ashen
now
to
the
lips
he
clutched
macheson
arm
frantically
they
are
after
me
he
exclaimed
where
can
i
hide
tell
me
quick
macheson
looked
at
him
gravely
what
have
you
been
doing
he
asked
they
do
not
bring
bloodhounds
out
for
nothing
i
have
hurt
a
man
down
in
the
village
was
the
terrified
answer
i
did
mean
to
no
i
swear
that
i
did
not
mean
to
i
went
to
his
house
and
i
asked
him
for
money
i
had
a
right
to
it
and
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
where
but
oh
you
would
not
understand
listen
i
swear
to
you
that
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
him
why
should
i
he
was
old
and
i
think
he
fainted
god
do
you
hear
that
he
clung
to
macheson
in
a
frenzy
the
deep
baying
of
the
dogs
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
listen
macheson
said
the
dogs
will
not
be
allowed
to
hurt
you
but
if
you
are
loose
i
promise
that
i
will
protect
you
from
them
you
had
better
wait
here
with
me
the
man
fell
upon
his
knees
sir
he
begged
i
am
innocent
of
everything
except
a
blow
struck
in
anger
help
me
to
escape
i
implore
you
there
are
others
who
will
suffer
if
anything
happens
to
me
the
law
is
just
macheson
answered
you
will
suffer
nothing
except
justice
i
want
mercy
not
justice
the
man
sobbed
for
the
love
of
god
help
me
macheson
hesitated
again
the
early
morning
stillness
was
broken
by
that
hoarse
terrifying
sound
his
sporting
instincts
were
aroused
he
had
small
sympathy
with
the
use
of
such
means
against
human
beings
i
will
give
you
a
chance
he
said
remember
it
is
nothing
more
follow
me
he
led
the
way
to
the
slate
pit
can
you
swim
he
asked
yes
the
man
answered
this
is
where
i
take
my
morning
bath
macheson
said
you
will
see
that
though
you
can
scramble
down
and
dive
in
it
is
too
precipitous
to
get
out
therefore
i
have
fixed
up
a
rope
on
the
other
side
it
goes
through
those
bushes
and
is
attached
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
beneath
the
bracken
if
you
swim
across
you
can
pull
yourself
out
of
the
water
and
hide
just
above
the
water
in
the
bushes
there
is
just
a
chance
that
you
may
escape
observation
already
he
was
on
his
way
down
but
macheson
stopped
him
i
shall
leave
a
suit
of
dry
clothes
in
the
shelter
he
said
if
they
should
give
up
the
chase
you
are
welcome
to
them
now
you
had
better
dive
they
are
in
the
spinney
the
man
went
in
after
the
fashion
of
a
practised
diver
macheson
turned
round
and
retraced
his
steps
towards
his
temporary
chapter
xii
retreat
out
in
the
lane
a
motley
little
group
of
men
were
standing
stephen
hurd
was
in
the
act
of
springing
off
his
brown
cob
the
dogs
were
already
in
the
shelter
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
hurd
asked
as
macheson
strode
through
the
undergrowth
macheson
pointed
to
the
shelter
i
could
find
no
other
lodging
he
answered
thanks
to
circumstances
of
which
you
are
aware
stephen
hurd
kicked
the
gate
open
he
was
pale
and
there
were
deep
lines
under
his
eyes
he
was
still
in
his
evening
clothes
except
for
a
rough
tweed
coat
but
his
white
tie
was
hanging
loose
and
his
shoes
were
splashed
with
mud
we
are
chasing
a
man
he
said
have
you
seen
him
i
have
macheson
answered
what
has
he
done
there
was
a
momentary
silence
hurd
spoke
with
a
sob
murdered
my
father
macheson
was
shocked
you
mean
that
hurd
is
dead
he
asked
in
an
tone
dead
the
young
man
answered
with
a
sob
killed
in
his
chair
the
dogs
came
out
of
the
shelter
they
turned
towards
the
interior
of
the
spinney
the
little
crowd
came
streaming
through
the
gate
i
gave
shelter
to
a
man
who
admitted
that
he
was
in
trouble
he
said
gravely
he
heard
the
dogs
and
he
was
terrified
he
has
jumped
into
the
slate
quarry
the
dogs
were
on
the
trail
now
they
followed
them
to
the
edge
of
the
quarry
here
the
bushes
were
trodden
down
a
man
cap
was
hanging
on
one
close
to
the
bottom
they
all
peered
over
into
the
still
water
unnaturally
black
amies
the
head
keeper
raised
his
head
it
feet
deep
some
say
forty
and
a
sheer
drop
he
declared
impressively
we
have
to
drag
it
for
the
body
best
take
the
dogs
round
the
other
side
and
make
sure
he
ai
got
out
again
one
of
the
crowd
suggested
amies
pointed
scornfully
to
the
precipitous
side
such
a
feat
was
clearly
impossible
nevertheless
the
dogs
were
taken
round
for
a
few
minutes
they
were
uneasy
but
eventually
they
returned
to
the
spot
from
which
their
intended
victim
had
dived
every
one
was
peering
down
into
the
dark
water
as
though
fascinated
i
thought
as
they
come
up
once
or
twice
before
they
were
drownded
somebody
remarked
not
unless
they
want
to
another
answered
this
chap
was
too
anxious
he
knew
his
goose
was
cooked
the
dogs
were
muzzled
and
led
away
one
by
one
the
labourers
and
servants
dispersed
two
of
them
started
off
to
telegraph
for
a
drag
stephen
hurd
was
one
of
the
last
to
depart
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
how
sorry
i
am
for
you
macheson
declared
earnestly
such
a
tragedy
in
a
village
like
thorpe
seems
almost
incredible
i
suppose
it
was
a
case
of
attempted
robbery
i
do
know
i
sure
hurd
answered
there
was
plenty
of
money
left
untouched
and
i
ca
find
that
there
is
any
short
the
man
arrived
after
the
maids
had
gone
to
bed
but
they
heard
him
knock
at
the
door
and
heard
my
father
let
him
in
they
did
hear
any
struggle
then
macheson
asked
hurd
shook
his
head
there
was
only
one
blow
upon
his
head
he
answered
graikson
says
that
death
was
probably
through
shock
macheson
felt
curiously
relieved
the
man
did
not
go
there
as
a
murderer
then
he
remarked
perhaps
not
even
as
a
thief
there
may
have
been
a
quarrel
he
killed
him
anyhow
hurd
said
brokenly
what
time
was
it
when
you
first
saw
him
about
midnight
i
should
think
macheson
answered
he
came
down
the
lane
like
a
drunken
man
what
was
he
like
hurd
asked
small
and
i
should
say
a
foreigner
macheson
answered
he
spoke
english
perfectly
but
there
was
an
accent
and
when
he
was
asleep
he
talked
to
himself
in
a
language
which
to
the
best
of
my
belief
i
have
never
heard
before
in
my
life
a
foreigner
hurd
muttered
you
are
sure
of
that
quite
macheson
answered
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
stephen
hurd
mounted
his
cob
and
turned
its
head
towards
home
he
asked
no
more
questions
he
seemed
if
possible
graver
than
ever
before
he
started
however
he
pointed
with
his
whip
towards
the
shelter
you
no
right
there
you
know
he
said
we
ca
allow
it
you
must
clear
out
at
once
very
well
macheson
answered
i
trespassing
of
course
but
one
must
sleep
somewhere
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
remain
in
thorpe
at
all
hurd
said
i
think
in
the
circumstances
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
in
the
circumstances
the
irony
of
the
phrase
struck
home
what
did
this
young
man
know
of
the
circumstances
there
were
reasons
now
indeed
why
he
should
fly
from
thorpe
as
from
a
place
stricken
with
the
pestilence
but
no
other
soul
in
this
world
could
know
of
those
reasons
save
himself
and
she
i
should
not
of
course
think
of
holding
my
services
at
present
macheson
said
gravely
if
you
think
it
would
be
better
i
will
go
away
stephen
hurd
nodded
as
he
cantered
off
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
he
declared
shortly
go
and
preach
in
the
towns
where
this
scum
is
reared
there
plenty
of
work
for
missioners
there
macheson
stood
still
until
the
young
man
on
his
pony
had
disappeared
then
he
turned
round
and
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
slate
quarry
the
black
waters
remained
smooth
and
unrippled
there
was
no
sound
of
human
movement
anywhere
in
the
adjoining
field
a
was
at
work
in
the
spinney
itself
the
rabbits
disturbed
last
night
by
the
storm
were
scurrying
about
more
frolicsome
than
usual
a
solitary
thrush
was
whistling
in
the
background
the
sunlight
lay
in
crooked
beams
about
the
undergrowth
a
gentle
west
breeze
was
just
stirring
the
foliage
overhead
there
was
nothing
in
the
air
to
suggest
in
any
way
the
strange
note
of
tragedy
which
the
coming
of
this
hunted
man
had
nevertheless
brought
macheson
was
turning
away
when
a
slight
disturbance
in
the
undergrowth
on
the
other
side
of
the
quarry
attracted
his
notice
he
stood
still
and
watched
the
spot
the
bracken
was
shaking
slightly
then
the
sound
of
a
dry
twig
suddenly
snapped
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
abruptly
away
with
almost
feverish
haste
he
flung
his
few
belongings
into
his
portmanteau
leaving
in
the
shelter
his
flask
a
suit
of
clothes
and
several
trifles
five
minutes
later
he
was
on
his
way
down
the
hill
with
his
bag
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
face
set
southwards
chapter
xiii
a
creature
of
impulse
up
the
broad
avenue
to
the
great
house
of
thorpe
stephen
hurd
slowly
made
his
way
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
but
his
appearance
was
not
altogether
the
appearance
of
a
man
overcome
with
grief
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
had
told
upon
him
and
his
deep
mourning
had
a
sombre
look
yet
there
were
thoughts
working
even
then
in
his
brain
which
battled
hard
with
his
natural
depression
strange
things
had
happened
stranger
things
than
he
was
able
all
at
once
to
digest
he
could
not
see
the
end
but
there
were
possibilities
upon
which
he
scarcely
dared
to
brood
he
was
shown
into
the
library
and
left
alone
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
then
wilhelmina
came
languid
and
moving
as
though
with
tired
feet
yet
her
manner
was
gentler
and
kinder
than
usual
she
leaned
back
in
one
of
the
vast
and
murmured
a
few
graceful
words
of
sympathy
we
were
all
so
sorry
for
you
hurd
she
said
it
was
a
most
shocking
affair
i
thank
you
very
much
madam
he
replied
after
a
moment
pause
it
was
better
perhaps
for
the
present
to
assume
that
their
relations
were
to
continue
those
of
employer
and
employed
i
do
not
know
she
continued
whether
you
care
to
speak
about
this
shocking
affair
perhaps
you
would
prefer
that
we
did
not
allude
to
it
for
the
present
he
shook
his
head
i
am
not
sure
he
answered
that
it
is
not
rather
a
relief
to
have
it
spoken
of
one
ca
get
it
out
of
one
mind
of
course
there
is
no
news
of
the
man
no
fresh
capture
none
he
answered
they
are
dragging
the
slate
quarry
again
i
believe
there
are
some
very
deep
holes
where
the
body
may
have
drifted
do
you
believe
that
that
is
the
case
she
asked
or
do
you
think
that
he
got
clean
away
i
can
not
tell
he
answered
it
seems
impossible
that
he
should
have
escaped
altogether
without
help
and
that
he
could
not
have
had
could
he
she
asked
he
looked
across
at
her
thoughtfully
watching
her
face
curious
to
see
whether
his
words
might
have
any
effect
only
from
one
person
he
said
yes
from
macheson
the
fellow
who
came
here
to
convert
us
all
he
said
deliberately
beyond
a
slight
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
his
scrutiny
was
in
vain
for
she
made
no
sign
he
scarcely
seems
a
likely
person
does
he
to
aid
a
criminal
she
asked
in
measured
tones
stephen
hurd
shrugged
his
shoulders
perhaps
not
he
admitted
but
at
any
rate
he
sheltered
him
as
he
doubtless
would
have
done
any
on
such
a
night
she
remarked
by
the
bye
what
has
become
of
that
young
man
he
has
left
the
neighbourhood
hurd
answered
shortly
left
altogether
she
inquired
i
imagine
so
hurd
answered
i
had
the
shelter
destroyed
and
i
gave
him
to
understand
pretty
clearly
what
your
wishes
were
there
really
was
much
else
for
him
to
do
her
eyelids
drooped
over
her
half
closed
eyes
for
a
moment
she
was
silent
if
you
hear
of
him
again
she
said
quietly
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
know
her
indifference
seemed
too
complete
to
be
assumed
yet
somehow
or
other
hurd
felt
that
she
was
displeased
with
him
i
will
do
so
he
said
if
i
hear
anything
about
him
it
scarcely
seems
likely
wilhelmina
sat
quite
still
her
head
resting
slightly
upon
the
long
delicate
fingers
of
her
right
hand
was
turned
away
from
the
young
man
who
was
daring
to
watch
her
she
was
apparently
gazing
across
the
park
down
the
magnificent
avenue
of
elms
which
led
to
the
village
so
he
was
gone
without
a
word
how
else
on
the
whole
she
could
not
but
approve
and
yet
and
yet
she
turned
once
more
to
hurd
i
read
the
account
of
the
inquest
on
your
father
death
she
said
speaking
very
slowly
with
her
usual
drawl
yet
with
a
softer
note
in
her
voice
as
though
out
of
respect
for
the
dead
man
does
it
not
seem
very
strange
that
the
money
was
left
untouched
yes
he
answered
yet
after
all
i
do
know
you
see
the
governor
must
have
closed
with
the
fellow
and
shown
fight
before
he
got
that
knock
on
the
head
if
the
thief
was
really
only
an
ordinary
tramp
be
scared
to
death
at
what
he
done
and
probably
bolt
for
his
life
without
stopping
to
take
anything
with
him
is
it
rather
surprising
to
have
tramps
in
thorpe
she
asked
i
have
scarcely
ever
seen
one
he
answered
wilhelmina
turned
her
head
slightly
so
that
she
was
now
directly
facing
him
she
looked
him
steadily
in
the
eyes
has
it
occurred
to
you
hurd
she
asked
that
this
young
man
may
not
have
been
a
tramp
at
all
and
that
his
visit
to
your
father
may
have
been
on
other
business
than
that
of
robbery
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
my
father
connexions
with
the
outside
world
he
said
slowly
were
so
slight
yet
it
has
occurred
to
you
yes
he
admitted
and
have
you
come
to
any
conclusion
none
he
declared
you
carried
out
my
instructions
with
regard
to
the
papers
and
documents
belonging
to
the
estate
certainly
madam
he
answered
within
five
minutes
of
receiving
your
message
they
were
all
locked
up
in
the
safe
and
the
key
handed
to
your
messenger
you
did
not
go
through
them
yourself
she
asked
i
did
not
he
answered
lying
with
admirable
steadiness
i
scarcely
felt
that
i
was
entitled
to
do
so
so
that
you
could
not
tell
if
any
were
missing
she
continued
i
could
not
he
admitted
your
father
never
spoke
then
of
any
connexions
with
people
outside
thorpe
likely
to
prove
of
a
dangerous
character
the
young
man
smiled
my
father
he
said
had
not
been
farther
than
loughborough
for
twenty
years
there
was
a
short
silence
wilhelmina
deliberately
and
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
was
meditatively
watching
the
young
man
studying
his
features
with
a
and
yet
searching
interest
perhaps
the
slightly
curving
lips
the
hard
intentness
of
her
gaze
suggested
that
he
was
disbelieved
he
lost
colour
and
fidgeted
about
it
was
a
scrutiny
not
easy
to
bear
and
he
felt
that
it
was
going
against
him
already
she
had
written
him
down
a
liar
she
spoke
to
him
at
last
if
the
silence
had
not
ended
soon
he
would
have
made
some
blundering
attempt
to
retrieve
his
position
she
spoke
just
in
time
to
avert
such
ignominy
hurd
she
said
the
question
of
your
father
successor
is
one
that
has
doubtless
occurred
to
you
as
it
has
to
me
i
trust
that
you
will
at
any
rate
remain
here
as
to
whether
i
can
offer
you
your
father
position
in
its
entirety
i
am
not
for
the
present
assured
he
glanced
up
at
her
furtively
he
was
certain
now
that
he
had
played
his
cards
she
had
read
through
him
easily
he
cursed
himself
for
a
lout
you
see
she
continued
the
post
is
one
of
great
responsibility
because
it
entails
the
management
of
the
whole
estates
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
feel
absolute
confidence
in
the
person
who
undertakes
it
i
have
not
known
you
very
long
mr
hurd
he
bowed
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
words
i
have
instructed
them
to
send
some
one
down
from
my
solicitor
office
for
a
week
or
so
she
continued
to
assist
you
in
the
meantime
i
must
think
the
matter
over
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
madam
he
said
you
will
find
me
i
think
quite
as
trustworthy
and
devoted
to
your
interests
as
my
father
she
smiled
slightly
she
recognized
exactly
his
quandary
and
it
amused
her
the
slightest
suggestion
of
menace
in
his
manner
would
be
to
give
the
lie
to
himself
i
am
coming
down
this
afternoon
she
said
to
go
through
the
safes
please
be
there
in
case
i
want
you
you
will
not
forget
in
case
you
should
hear
anything
of
macheson
that
i
desire
to
be
informed
he
took
his
leave
humiliated
and
angry
he
had
started
the
game
with
a
wrong
move
retrievable
perhaps
but
annoying
wilhelmina
passed
into
the
library
where
lady
peggy
in
a
wonderful
morning
robe
was
leaning
back
in
an
dictating
letters
to
captain
austin
you
dear
woman
she
exclaimed
do
interrupt
us
will
you
i
have
found
an
ideal
secretary
writes
everything
i
tell
him
and
spells
quite
decently
considering
his
profession
my
conscience
is
getting
lighter
every
moment
and
my
heart
heavier
austin
grumbled
a
most
flirtatious
correspondence
yours
she
laughed
softly
my
next
shall
be
to
my
dressmaker
she
declared
such
a
charming
woman
and
so
trustful
behave
yourself
nicely
and
you
shall
go
with
me
to
call
on
her
next
week
and
see
her
mannikins
by
the
bye
wilhelmina
am
i
hostess
or
are
you
you
by
all
means
wilhelmina
answered
i
shall
go
or
the
next
day
is
any
one
coming
to
lunch
his
grace
i
fancy
no
one
else
wilhelmina
yawned
where
is
gilbert
she
asked
asleep
on
the
lawn
last
time
i
saw
him
no
one
shooting
then
we
going
to
beat
up
the
home
turnips
after
lunch
captain
austin
answered
it
rather
an
off
day
with
us
gilbert
is
nursing
his
leg
fancies
he
has
rheumatism
coming
she
strolled
out
into
the
garden
but
she
avoided
the
spot
where
gilbert
deyes
lounged
in
an
reading
the
paper
and
smoking
cigarettes
with
his
leg
carefully
arranged
on
a
garden
chair
in
front
of
him
she
took
the
winding
path
which
skirted
the
kitchen
gardens
and
led
to
the
green
lane
along
which
the
carts
passed
to
the
home
farm
she
felt
that
what
she
was
doing
was
in
the
nature
of
an
experiment
she
was
yielding
again
to
that
most
astonishing
impulse
which
once
before
had
taken
her
so
completely
by
surprise
she
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
along
the
lane
she
began
to
climb
the
hill
about
the
success
of
her
experiment
she
no
longer
had
any
doubt
her
heart
was
beating
with
pleasant
insistence
a
feeling
of
suppressed
excitement
sent
the
blood
gliding
through
her
veins
with
delicious
softness
all
the
time
she
mocked
at
herself
that
this
should
be
wilhelmina
to
whom
the
most
distinguished
men
not
only
in
one
capital
but
in
europe
had
paid
court
whom
the
most
ardent
wooer
had
failed
to
move
who
had
found
indeed
in
all
the
professions
of
something
insufferably
tedious
she
was
at
once
amused
and
annoyed
at
herself
but
an
instinctive
habit
of
truthfulness
forbade
even
her
cheeks
were
aflame
and
her
heart
was
beating
like
a
girl
as
she
reached
the
spinney
she
recognized
the
fact
that
she
was
experiencing
a
new
and
delightful
pleasure
an
emotion
as
unexpected
and
ridiculous
as
it
was
inexplicable
but
she
hugged
it
to
herself
it
pleased
her
immensely
to
feel
that
the
impossible
had
happened
what
all
this
army
of
men
experienced
in
the
wiles
of
had
failed
to
do
a
crazy
boy
had
accomplished
without
an
effort
absolutely
bizarre
of
course
but
not
so
wonderful
after
all
she
was
so
secure
against
any
ordinary
assault
she
felt
herself
like
the
heroine
of
one
of
novels
if
he
had
been
there
himself
she
would
have
taken
him
into
her
arms
with
all
the
passionate
simplicity
of
a
child
but
he
was
not
there
on
the
contrary
the
place
was
looking
forlorn
and
deserted
the
shelter
had
been
razed
to
the
ground
she
felt
that
she
hated
stephen
hurd
as
she
contemplated
its
ruin
the
hedge
was
broken
down
by
the
inrush
of
people
a
few
days
ago
in
the
absence
of
any
sunshine
the
country
around
seemed
bleak
and
colourless
she
leaned
over
the
gate
and
half
closed
her
eyes
memory
came
more
easily
like
that
chapter
xiv
searching
the
papers
the
late
stephen
hurd
had
been
a
methodical
man
every
one
of
those
many
packets
of
foolscap
and
parchment
bore
in
the
corner
near
the
top
a
few
carefully
written
words
summarizing
their
contents
it
was
clear
from
the
first
that
wilhelmina
had
undertaken
not
an
examination
but
a
search
mortgages
leases
agreements
she
left
unopened
and
untouched
one
by
one
she
passed
them
back
to
the
young
man
who
handed
them
out
to
her
for
replacement
in
the
end
she
had
retained
one
small
packet
of
letters
only
on
the
outside
of
which
were
simply
the
initials
these
she
held
for
a
moment
thoughtfully
in
her
hand
do
you
happen
to
remember
hurd
she
said
whether
this
small
packet
which
i
have
here
was
amongst
the
papers
which
you
found
had
been
disturbed
after
the
attack
upon
your
father
i
am
sorry
the
young
man
answered
but
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
say
i
do
not
remember
it
particularly
wilhelmina
turned
it
over
thoughtfully
it
was
an
insignificant
packet
to
hold
the
tragedy
of
a
woman
life
you
see
she
continued
that
it
has
the
appearance
of
having
been
tampered
with
there
are
marks
of
sealing
wax
upon
the
tape
and
upon
the
paper
here
then
too
she
continued
turning
it
over
it
has
been
tied
up
hastily
unlike
any
of
the
other
packets
the
tape
too
is
much
too
long
it
looks
almost
as
though
some
letters
or
papers
had
been
withdrawn
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
at
all
he
admitted
regretfully
my
father
never
allowed
any
one
but
himself
to
open
that
safe
mine
was
the
share
of
the
work
and
the
of
course
i
kept
that
she
slowly
undid
the
tape
the
contents
of
the
packet
consisted
of
several
letters
which
she
smoothed
out
with
her
fingers
before
beginning
to
read
stephen
hurd
stood
with
his
back
towards
her
rearranging
the
bundles
of
documents
in
the
safe
you
have
no
idea
then
she
asked
softly
of
the
contents
of
this
packet
he
turned
deliberately
round
he
was
not
in
the
least
comfortable
it
was
almost
as
though
she
could
see
through
his
tweed
into
that
inner
pocket
may
i
see
which
packet
you
refer
to
he
asked
she
showed
it
to
him
without
placing
it
in
his
hand
he
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
have
not
noticed
them
before
she
sighed
or
was
it
a
yawn
at
any
rate
her
eyes
left
his
face
for
which
he
was
immediately
grateful
she
began
to
read
the
papers
and
having
finished
his
task
he
walked
towards
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
he
stood
there
minute
after
minute
hearing
only
the
sound
of
rustling
paper
behind
when
at
last
it
ceased
he
turned
around
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
slowly
drawing
on
her
gloves
the
letters
had
disappeared
presumably
into
her
pocket
but
she
made
no
reference
to
them
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
smooth
and
deliberate
as
usual
somehow
or
other
he
was
at
once
conscious
however
that
she
had
received
a
shock
i
presume
hurd
she
said
quietly
that
amongst
your
private
papers
you
did
not
discover
anything
unexpected
i
am
afraid
i
scarcely
follow
you
madam
he
answered
i
am
asking
you
she
repeated
deliberately
whether
amongst
your
father
private
papers
which
i
presume
you
have
looked
through
you
found
anything
of
a
surprising
nature
he
shook
his
head
i
found
scarcely
any
he
answered
only
his
will
and
a
memorandum
of
a
few
investments
may
i
ask
she
turned
towards
the
door
no
she
said
do
not
ask
me
any
questions
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
not
yet
fully
persuaded
that
the
necessity
exists
i
do
not
understand
he
protested
illustration
forgive
me
he
said
with
his
hand
upon
the
gate
page
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
did
not
trouble
to
explain
her
words
he
followed
her
along
the
cool
hall
hung
with
old
prints
and
trophies
of
sport
into
the
few
yards
of
garden
outside
brilliant
with
cottage
flowers
beyond
the
little
iron
gate
her
carriage
was
waiting
a
low
victoria
drawn
by
a
pair
of
great
horses
whose
sleek
coats
and
dark
crimson
rosettes
suggested
rather
a
turn
in
the
park
than
these
country
lanes
the
young
man
was
becoming
desperate
she
was
leaving
him
altogether
mystified
somewhere
or
other
he
had
missed
his
cue
he
had
meant
to
have
conducted
the
interview
so
differently
and
never
had
she
looked
so
provokingly
well
he
recognized
with
hopeless
admiration
the
perfection
of
her
toilette
the
trim
white
flannel
dress
shaped
by
the
hand
of
an
artist
to
reveal
in
its
simple
lines
the
peculiar
grace
of
her
slim
figure
the
patent
shoes
with
their
suggestion
of
silk
stockings
the
black
picture
hat
and
veil
a
delicate
recognition
of
her
visit
to
a
house
of
mourning
yet
light
and
with
no
suggestion
of
gloom
never
had
she
seemed
so
desirable
to
him
so
fascinating
and
yet
so
unattainable
he
made
a
last
and
clumsy
effort
to
himself
forgive
me
he
said
with
his
hand
upon
the
gate
but
i
must
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
that
last
question
my
father
had
no
secrets
that
i
know
of
how
could
he
when
for
the
last
forty
years
his
life
was
practically
spent
in
this
village
street
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
sometimes
she
murmured
events
come
to
those
even
who
sit
and
wait
those
whose
lives
are
absolutely
secluded
no
one
is
safe
from
fate
you
know
but
my
father
he
answered
he
had
no
tastes
no
interests
outside
the
boundary
of
your
estates
she
motioned
to
him
to
open
the
gate
perhaps
not
she
assented
yet
i
suppose
that
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
knows
as
much
of
his
neighbour
life
as
he
imagines
he
does
good
afternoon
hurd
my
visit
has
given
me
something
to
think
about
i
may
send
for
you
to
come
to
the
house
before
i
go
away
she
drove
away
leaning
back
amongst
the
cushions
with
half
closed
eyes
as
though
tired
the
country
scenery
with
its
pastoral
landscape
its
perfections
was
wholly
unseen
her
memory
had
travelled
back
she
was
away
amongst
the
days
when
the
roar
of
life
had
been
in
her
ears
when
for
a
short
while
indeed
the
waves
had
seemed
likely
to
break
over
her
head
an
unpleasant
echo
this
no
more
than
an
echo
and
yet
the
thought
of
old
stephen
hurd
lying
in
his
grave
suddenly
chilled
her
she
shivered
as
she
left
the
carriage
and
instead
of
entering
the
house
crossed
the
lawn
to
where
gilbert
deyes
was
lounging
he
struggled
to
his
feet
at
her
approach
but
she
waved
him
back
again
sybarite
she
murmured
glancing
around
at
his
arrangements
for
complete
comfort
you
have
sent
austin
out
alone
dear
lady
i
confess
it
he
answered
what
would
you
have
it
is
too
fine
an
afternoon
to
kill
anything
she
sank
into
a
chair
by
his
side
a
slight
smile
parted
her
lips
as
she
glanced
around
on
a
table
by
his
side
a
table
drawn
back
into
the
shade
of
the
cedar
tree
were
several
volumes
a
tall
glass
and
a
crystal
jug
half
full
of
some
delicate
amber
beverage
mixed
with
fruit
and
ice
a
box
of
cigarettes
an
ivory
and
a
fan
your
capacity
for
making
yourself
comfortable
she
remarked
amounts
almost
to
genius
let
it
go
at
that
he
answered
i
like
the
sound
of
the
word
i
want
you
to
go
to
paris
for
me
she
said
abruptly
he
flicked
the
ash
off
the
end
of
his
cigarette
and
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
not
a
line
of
his
face
betrayed
the
least
sign
of
surprise
he
asked
yes
i
can
get
up
in
time
for
the
he
remarked
thoughtfully
i
wonder
whether
it
will
be
too
late
for
the
armenonville
she
laughed
quietly
you
are
a
she
declared
naturally
he
admitted
we
all
are
even
when
the
audience
consists
of
ourselves
alone
i
fancy
i
rather
better
than
most
though
she
nodded
you
wo
mind
admitting
to
me
that
you
are
surprised
astonished
he
said
to
descend
to
the
commonplace
what
on
earth
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
paris
for
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
forget
for
a
moment
the
paris
that
you
know
and
remember
the
paris
of
the
tourist
painful
he
answered
but
it
is
done
the
de
i
know
it
well
there
are
a
race
of
creatures
there
small
parasitical
insects
who
hang
about
the
hall
and
the
boulevard
outside
guides
they
call
themselves
you
something
altogether
new
this
evening
captain
he
quoted
yes
i
know
them
there
is
or
was
one
she
continued
who
goes
by
the
name
of
thomas
johnson
he
is
undersized
he
has
red
cheeks
and
puffy
brown
eyes
he
used
to
wear
a
glazed
black
hat
and
he
speaks
every
language
without
an
accent
i
should
know
the
beast
anywhere
he
declared
find
out
if
he
is
there
still
let
him
take
you
out
do
lose
sight
of
him
and
write
to
me
night
he
said
i
will
renew
my
youth
i
will
search
for
him
on
the
boulevards
and
see
the
sights
which
make
a
gay
dog
of
the
travelling
briton
she
nodded
you
a
good
sort
gilbert
she
said
simply
thanks
chapter
xv
on
the
spree
high
up
on
the
seventh
floor
of
one
of
london
newest
and
loftiest
buildings
a
young
man
sat
writing
in
a
somewhat
barely
furnished
office
he
wrote
deliberately
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
his
occupation
the
place
had
a
bookish
aspect
the
table
was
strewn
with
magazines
and
books
of
reference
piles
of
literature
of
a
varied
order
stood
in
the
absence
of
bookshelves
against
the
wall
the
young
man
himself
however
was
the
most
interesting
object
in
the
room
he
was
big
and
dark
and
rugged
there
was
strength
in
his
shoulders
in
the
compression
of
his
lips
even
in
the
way
his
finger
guided
the
pen
across
the
paper
he
was
thoroughly
absorbed
in
his
task
nevertheless
he
raised
his
head
at
a
somewhat
unusual
sound
the
lift
had
swung
up
to
his
floor
he
heard
the
metal
gate
thrown
open
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
macheson
walked
in
victor
by
glory
down
went
the
pen
and
richard
holderness
stood
up
at
his
desk
with
outstretched
hands
macheson
grasped
them
heartily
and
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
it
good
to
see
you
dick
he
declared
like
coming
back
to
the
primitive
forces
of
nature
unchanged
unchanging
the
sight
of
enough
to
stop
a
revolution
you
feeling
like
that
are
you
his
friend
answered
his
eyes
fixed
upon
macheson
face
yes
i
see
you
are
go
ahead
or
will
you
smoke
first
macheson
produced
his
pipe
and
his
host
a
great
tin
of
honeydew
macheson
helped
himself
slowly
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
gain
time
blessed
compact
ours
the
giant
remarked
leaning
back
in
his
chair
no
probing
for
confidences
no
silly
questions
out
with
it
i
started
wrong
macheson
said
i
have
to
go
back
on
my
tracks
a
bit
anyway
holderness
grunted
affably
nothing
like
mistakes
he
remarked
best
discipline
in
the
world
i
started
on
a
theory
macheson
continued
thoughtfully
it
did
pan
out
the
people
i
have
been
trying
to
get
at
are
better
left
alone
exactly
why
holderness
asked
i
tell
you
macheson
answered
you
know
i
seen
a
bit
of
what
we
call
village
life
their
standard
is
high
enough
of
course
things
come
too
easily
their
noses
are
too
close
to
the
ground
they
are
moderately
sober
moderately
industrious
but
the
sameness
of
life
is
at
work
all
the
time
it
makes
machines
of
the
factory
hands
animals
of
the
country
folk
i
knew
that
before
i
started
i
thought
i
could
lift
their
heads
a
little
it
too
big
a
task
for
me
dick
of
course
holderness
assented
you
ca
graft
on
to
dead
wood
they
live
decent
lives
most
of
them
macheson
continued
thoughtfully
they
ca
understand
that
any
change
is
needed
no
more
can
their
landlords
or
their
clergy
a
mechanical
performance
of
the
christian
code
seems
all
that
any
one
expects
from
them
dick
it
all
capable
of
you
ca
alter
laws
you
ca
create
intelligence
you
ca
teach
these
people
spirituality
as
well
try
to
teach
to
fly
holderness
answered
i
could
have
told
you
so
before
if
it
had
been
of
any
use
what
about
these
welshmen
though
it
hysteria
macheson
declared
if
you
can
get
through
the
hide
you
can
make
the
emotions
run
riot
stir
them
into
a
frenzy
it
a
debauch
i
been
there
to
see
the
true
spiritual
life
is
partly
intellectual
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
holderness
asked
i
do
know
macheson
answered
i
have
finished
yet
dick
curse
all
women
the
giant
looked
thoughtful
i
sorry
he
said
simply
macheson
swung
himself
from
the
table
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
it
is
serious
he
declared
it
is
even
definite
but
it
like
a
perfume
or
a
wonderful
chord
of
music
or
the
call
of
the
sea
to
an
viking
it
under
my
heel
dick
but
i
ca
crush
it
i
came
away
from
leicestershire
because
i
was
afraid
does
she
exist
holderness
asked
not
for
me
macheson
declared
hurriedly
do
think
that
i
should
have
mentioned
it
but
for
our
compact
holderness
nodded
bad
luck
he
said
this
craving
for
something
we
have
got
have
i
wish
i
could
find
the
germ
the
world
should
go
free
of
it
for
a
generation
we
build
empires
we
reconstruct
society
it
a
deadly
germ
though
victor
and
it
the
princes
of
the
world
who
suffer
most
there
only
one
antidote
work
give
me
some
macheson
begged
the
giant
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
right
he
answered
but
not
clothes
up
in
town
macheson
nodded
we
go
on
the
bust
holderness
declared
i
been
dying
for
a
spree
we
have
it
where
are
you
staying
my
old
rooms
macheson
answered
i
looked
in
on
my
way
from
the
station
and
found
them
empty
capital
we
close
together
come
on
we
do
the
west
end
like
two
gay
young
bucks
five
is
it
we
walk
up
regent
street
and
have
an
at
biflore
wait
till
i
brush
my
hat
macheson
made
no
difficulties
but
he
was
puzzled
holderness
he
knew
well
enough
had
no
leanings
towards
the
things
which
he
proposed
with
so
much
enthusiasm
was
it
a
pilgrimage
they
were
to
start
upon
or
what
after
all
why
need
he
worry
he
was
content
to
go
his
friend
way
so
they
walked
up
regent
street
bright
with
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
threading
their
way
through
the
throngs
of
sauntering
men
and
women
gazing
into
the
shops
and
at
one
another
at
biflore
macheson
would
have
felt
out
of
his
element
but
for
holderness
he
had
the
air
of
going
through
what
might
have
been
an
everyday
performance
ordered
vermouth
mixed
lit
a
cigarette
leaned
back
at
his
ease
upon
the
cushioned
seat
and
told
with
zest
and
point
a
humorous
story
there
were
women
there
a
dozen
or
more
some
alone
some
in
little
groups
women
smartly
enough
dressed
too
and
prosperous
with
gold
purses
and
paris
hats
yet
lacking
something
macheson
did
not
ask
himself
what
it
was
he
felt
it
he
knew
too
that
holderness
meant
him
to
feel
it
the
shadow
of
tragedy
was
there
the
world
tragedy
they
went
back
to
their
rooms
to
dress
and
met
at
a
popular
restaurant
one
of
the
smartest
here
macheson
began
to
recover
his
spirits
the
music
was
soft
yet
inspiring
the
women
there
were
none
alone
here
were
well
dressed
and
pleasant
to
look
at
the
sound
of
their
laughter
and
the
gay
murmur
of
conversation
was
like
a
delightful
undernote
the
dinner
and
wine
were
good
holderness
seemed
to
know
very
well
how
to
choose
both
macheson
began
to
feel
the
depression
of
a
few
hours
ago
slipping
away
from
him
once
or
twice
he
laughed
softly
to
himself
holderness
looked
at
him
questioningly
you
should
have
been
with
me
for
the
last
fortnight
dick
he
remarked
smiling
the
lady
of
the
manor
at
thorpe
did
approve
of
me
and
i
had
to
sleep
for
two
nights
in
a
gamekeeper
shelter
did
approve
of
you
to
such
an
extent
holderness
remarked
was
she
one
of
those
old
country
frumps
all
starch
and
prejudice
then
for
a
moment
the
heel
was
lifted
and
a
rush
of
memory
kept
him
dumb
he
felt
the
tearing
of
the
blood
in
his
veins
the
burning
of
his
cheeks
the
wild
delicious
sense
of
an
exaltation
indefinable
mysterious
he
was
suddenly
apprehensive
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
he
felt
somehow
nearer
to
her
it
was
her
atmosphere
this
was
he
weaker
than
his
friend
had
he
indeed
more
to
fear
he
raised
his
glass
mechanically
to
his
lips
and
the
soft
fire
of
the
amber
wine
soothed
whilst
it
disquieted
him
again
he
wondered
at
his
friend
whim
in
choosing
this
manner
of
spending
their
evening
no
he
said
at
last
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
his
voice
composed
and
natural
the
mistress
of
thorpe
is
not
in
the
least
that
sort
thorpe
is
almost
a
model
village
and
of
course
there
is
the
church
and
a
very
decent
fellow
for
vicar
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
she
was
not
right
i
must
have
seemed
a
fearful
interloper
holderness
stretched
his
long
limbs
under
the
table
and
laughed
softly
well
he
declared
it
was
a
scheme
theoretically
i
believe
you
were
right
there
nothing
more
dangerous
than
content
sort
of
armour
you
ca
get
through
come
we
must
miss
the
ballet
they
threaded
their
way
down
the
room
suddenly
macheson
stopped
short
he
was
passing
a
table
set
back
in
a
recess
and
occupied
by
two
persons
the
girl
who
wore
a
hat
and
veil
and
whose
simple
country
clothes
were
conspicuous
was
staring
at
him
with
something
like
fear
in
her
eyes
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
lips
parted
she
was
leaning
forward
as
though
to
call
her
companion
attention
to
approach
macheson
glanced
towards
him
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
indignant
apprehension
it
was
stephen
hurd
in
irreproachable
evening
clothes
save
only
for
his
black
tie
and
his
companion
was
letty
macheson
stopped
before
the
table
he
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
or
how
to
say
it
but
he
was
determined
not
to
be
intimidated
by
hurd
curt
nod
so
you
are
up
in
town
letty
he
said
gravely
is
your
mother
with
you
the
girl
giggled
hysterically
oh
no
she
declared
mother
ca
bear
travelling
a
lot
of
us
came
up
this
morning
at
six
on
a
day
excursion
six
shillings
each
and
what
time
does
the
train
go
back
macheson
asked
quickly
at
twelve
the
girl
answered
or
as
soon
afterwards
as
they
can
get
it
off
it
was
terribly
full
coming
up
macheson
was
to
some
extent
relieved
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
further
that
he
could
do
he
bent
over
the
girl
kindly
i
hope
you
have
had
a
nice
day
he
said
and
wo
be
too
tired
when
you
get
home
these
excursions
are
rather
hard
work
remember
me
to
your
mother
he
exchanged
a
civil
word
with
the
girl
companion
who
was
taciturn
almost
to
insolence
then
he
passed
on
and
joined
holderness
who
was
waiting
near
the
door
an
oddly
assorted
couple
your
friends
he
remarked
as
they
struggled
into
their
coats
macheson
nodded
the
girl
was
my
landlady
daughter
at
thorpe
and
the
young
man
the
son
of
the
agent
there
he
said
engaged
holderness
asked
i
afraid
not
macheson
answered
she
up
on
an
excursion
for
the
day
goes
back
at
twelve
i
suppose
he
a
decent
fellow
the
agent
son
holderness
remarked
she
seems
such
a
child
i
suppose
he
is
macheson
repeated
i
do
care
for
him
very
much
dick
i
suppose
i
an
person
but
i
hate
leaving
them
holderness
looked
back
into
the
restaurant
you
ca
interfere
he
said
it
probably
a
harmless
frolic
enough
come
on
chapter
xvi
the
night
side
of
london
no
stalls
left
holderness
declared
turning
away
from
the
box
office
at
the
alhambra
we
go
in
the
promenade
we
can
find
a
chair
there
if
we
want
to
sit
down
macheson
followed
him
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
heavily
carpeted
promenade
his
memory
of
the
evening
a
memory
which
clung
to
him
for
long
afterwards
seemed
like
a
phantasmagoria
of
thrilling
music
a
stage
packed
with
marvellously
dressed
women
whose
movements
were
blended
with
the
music
into
one
voluptuous
chorus
a
blaze
of
colour
not
wholly
without
its
artistic
significance
and
about
him
an
air
heavy
with
tobacco
smoke
and
perfumes
a
throng
of
moving
people
more
women
many
more
women
a
girl
spoke
to
holderness
a
girl
heavily
rouged
but
not
dressed
in
a
blue
muslin
gown
and
large
black
hat
holderness
bent
towards
her
deferentially
his
voice
seemed
to
take
to
itself
its
utmost
note
of
courtesy
he
answered
her
inquiry
pleasantly
and
accepted
a
glance
at
her
programme
the
girl
looked
puzzled
but
they
talked
together
for
several
moments
of
casual
things
then
holderness
lifted
his
hat
my
friend
and
i
are
tired
he
said
we
are
going
to
look
for
a
seat
she
bowed
and
they
strolled
on
down
the
promenade
finding
some
chairs
at
the
further
end
the
dresses
of
the
women
brushed
their
feet
and
the
perfume
from
the
clothes
was
stronger
even
than
the
odour
from
the
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
which
hung
about
the
place
macheson
in
whom
were
generations
of
puritanical
impulses
found
himself
shrinking
back
in
his
corner
holderness
turned
towards
him
frowning
no
superiority
victor
he
said
these
are
your
do
look
at
them
as
though
you
come
down
from
the
clouds
it
is
that
macheson
answered
it
a
matter
of
taste
taste
rot
holderness
answered
the
factory
girl
hat
offends
my
taste
but
i
do
shrink
away
from
her
a
girl
in
passing
stumbled
against
his
foot
holderness
stood
up
as
he
apologized
i
am
really
very
sorry
he
said
no
one
with
feet
like
mine
ought
to
sit
down
in
a
public
place
i
hope
you
have
torn
your
dress
it
really
does
matter
the
girl
answered
i
ought
to
have
looked
where
i
was
going
in
which
case
holderness
remarked
with
a
laugh
you
could
not
have
failed
to
see
my
feet
there
were
two
empty
chairs
at
their
table
the
girl
glanced
towards
them
and
hesitated
do
you
mind
if
we
sit
down
here
for
a
minute
she
asked
my
friend
and
i
we
are
rather
tired
he
drew
the
chairs
towards
them
by
all
means
he
answered
courteously
your
friend
does
look
tired
the
party
arranged
itself
holderness
called
to
a
waiter
and
gave
an
order
my
friend
and
i
he
remarked
indicating
macheson
who
was
fiercely
uncomfortable
and
struggling
hard
not
to
show
it
are
disappointed
that
we
could
not
get
stalls
we
wanted
to
see
la
guerrero
and
this
wonderful
conjurer
the
place
is
full
every
night
the
girl
answered
listlessly
la
guerrero
comes
on
at
ten
you
can
see
her
from
the
front
of
the
promenade
easily
you
do
often
come
here
do
you
not
very
often
holderness
answered
and
you
every
night
the
girl
answered
in
a
dull
tone
that
must
be
monotonous
he
said
kindly
it
is
she
admitted
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
longer
or
rather
it
was
holderness
who
mostly
talked
and
the
others
who
listened
it
struck
macheson
as
curious
that
his
friend
should
find
it
so
easy
to
strike
the
note
of
their
conversation
and
keep
it
there
as
though
without
any
definite
effort
he
could
assume
control
over
even
the
thoughts
of
these
girls
to
whom
he
talked
with
such
easy
courtesy
he
told
a
funny
story
and
they
all
laughed
naturally
and
heartily
macheson
had
an
idea
that
the
girls
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
exactly
where
they
were
something
in
their
faces
something
which
had
almost
terrified
him
at
their
first
coming
had
relaxed
if
it
had
not
passed
wholly
away
at
the
sound
of
a
few
bars
of
music
one
of
them
leaned
almost
eagerly
forward
there
she
said
if
you
want
to
see
la
guerrero
you
must
hurry
she
is
coming
on
now
the
two
young
men
rose
to
their
feet
one
of
the
girls
looked
wistfully
at
holderness
but
nothing
was
said
beyond
the
ordinary
farewells
thank
you
so
much
for
telling
us
holderness
said
come
along
victor
it
is
la
guerrero
macheson
breathed
more
freely
when
once
they
were
in
the
throng
they
watched
the
spanish
dancer
with
her
exquisite
movements
sinuous
full
of
grace
holderness
especially
applauded
loudly
afterwards
they
found
seats
in
the
front
and
remained
there
for
the
rest
of
the
performance
out
in
the
street
they
hesitated
holderness
passed
his
arm
through
his
companion
supper
he
declared
this
way
did
you
know
what
a
man
about
town
i
was
victor
ah
but
one
must
learn
and
life
is
all
roses
and
honey
one
must
learn
they
threaded
their
way
through
the
streets
crowded
with
hansoms
electric
broughams
and
streams
of
foot
passengers
holderness
led
the
way
to
a
building
and
into
a
room
barely
lit
save
for
the
lamps
upon
the
tables
macheson
gasped
as
he
entered
nearly
every
table
was
occupied
by
women
in
evening
dress
women
alone
waiting
holderness
glanced
around
quite
unconcernedly
as
he
gave
up
his
coat
and
hat
to
a
waiter
feeling
shy
victor
he
asked
smiling
never
mind
we
find
a
table
to
ourselves
all
right
they
sat
in
a
corner
the
girls
chattered
and
talked
across
them
often
at
them
a
frenchwoman
superbly
gowned
in
white
lace
and
with
a
long
rope
of
pearls
around
her
neck
paused
as
she
passed
their
table
she
carried
a
pomeranian
under
her
arm
and
held
it
out
towards
them
see
my
little
dog
she
exclaimed
he
bite
you
messieurs
are
lonely
alas
of
necessity
holderness
answered
in
french
madame
is
too
kind
she
passed
on
laughing
macheson
looked
across
the
table
almost
fiercely
what
are
you
doing
it
for
dick
he
exclaimed
what
does
it
mean
his
friend
looked
across
at
him
steadfastly
victor
he
said
i
want
you
to
understand
you
are
an
enthusiast
a
reformer
a
prophet
of
lost
causes
i
want
you
to
know
the
truth
if
you
can
see
it
there
are
many
sides
to
life
what
am
i
to
learn
of
this
macheson
asked
almost
passionately
if
i
told
you
holderness
answered
the
lesson
would
only
be
half
learnt
sit
tight
and
do
be
a
fool
drink
your
wine
mademoiselle
in
violet
there
wants
to
flirt
with
you
shall
i
ask
her
to
join
us
macheson
demanded
with
wasted
satire
you
might
do
worse
holderness
answered
calmly
she
could
probably
teach
you
something
it
was
a
dull
evening
and
many
of
the
tables
remained
unoccupied
save
for
the
one
waiting
figure
the
women
tired
of
looking
towards
the
door
were
smoking
cigarettes
twirling
their
bracelets
yawning
and
looking
around
the
room
many
a
mute
invitation
reached
the
two
young
men
but
holderness
seemed
to
have
lost
his
sociability
his
face
had
grown
harder
and
he
seemed
glad
when
their
meal
was
over
and
they
were
free
to
depart
in
the
hall
below
they
had
to
wait
for
their
overcoats
macheson
strolled
idly
towards
the
entrance
of
another
supper
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
looked
in
an
exclamation
broke
from
his
lips
he
turned
towards
holderness
you
see
the
time
he
exclaimed
and
they
are
here
those
two
holderness
nodded
gravely
the
girl
has
been
crying
he
said
and
there
is
an
a
b
c
on
the
table
it
up
to
you
victor
we
may
both
have
to
take
a
hand
in
the
game
no
i
would
go
in
wait
till
they
come
out
they
stood
in
the
throng
jostled
cajoled
besought
at
last
the
two
rose
and
came
towards
the
door
letty
had
dried
her
eyes
but
she
looked
still
pale
and
terrified
hurd
on
the
contrary
was
flushed
as
though
with
wine
macheson
took
her
by
the
arm
as
she
passed
letty
he
said
gravely
have
you
missed
your
train
she
gave
a
stifled
cry
and
shrank
back
when
she
saw
who
it
was
however
she
recovered
herself
quickly
mr
macheson
she
exclaimed
how
you
startled
me
i
did
expect
to
see
you
again
about
this
train
letty
he
repeated
hurd
watch
stopped
she
declared
her
eyes
filling
once
more
with
tears
he
thought
it
was
eleven
and
it
was
ten
minutes
past
twelve
i
do
know
what
mother
will
say
i
am
sure
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
she
looked
round
nervously
hurd
is
going
to
take
me
to
some
friends
of
his
she
answered
you
see
it
was
his
fault
so
he
has
promised
to
see
mother
and
explain
hurd
pushed
angrily
forward
look
here
he
said
to
macheson
have
you
been
following
us
about
i
have
not
macheson
answered
calmly
i
am
very
glad
to
have
come
across
you
though
sorry
i
ca
return
the
compliment
hurd
remarked
come
letty
a
girl
who
was
passing
tapped
him
on
the
arm
she
was
dressed
in
blue
silk
with
a
large
picture
hat
and
she
was
smoking
a
cigarette
hullo
stephen
she
exclaimed
edith
wants
to
see
you
are
you
coming
round
hurd
muttered
something
under
his
breath
and
moved
away
letty
looked
at
him
with
horror
stephen
she
exclaimed
you
ca
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
know
any
of
these
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
he
tried
to
pass
his
arm
through
hers
do
be
a
fool
letty
he
said
it
time
we
went
or
my
friends
will
have
gone
to
bed
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
her
lips
were
quivering
it
was
as
though
she
saw
some
new
thing
in
his
face
your
friends
she
murmured
are
they
that
sort
oh
i
am
afraid
she
clung
to
macheson
people
were
beginning
to
notice
them
he
led
her
out
into
the
street
hurd
followed
angrily
protesting
holderness
was
close
behind
i
say
you
know
hurd
began
with
his
arm
on
macheson
shoulder
macheson
shook
it
off
hurd
he
said
at
the
risk
of
seeming
impertinent
i
must
ask
you
precisely
where
you
intend
taking
this
girl
what
the
devil
business
is
it
of
yours
hurd
answered
angrily
tell
me
all
the
same
macheson
persisted
hurd
passed
his
arm
through
letty
come
letty
he
said
we
will
take
this
hansom
the
girl
was
only
half
willing
macheson
declined
to
let
them
go
no
he
said
i
will
have
my
question
answered
hurd
turned
as
though
to
strike
him
but
holderness
intervened
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
the
other
i
think
he
said
that
we
will
have
my
friend
question
answered
hurd
was
almost
shaking
with
rage
but
he
answered
to
some
friends
in
cambridge
terrace
he
said
sullenly
number
eighteen
you
will
not
object
macheson
said
if
i
accompany
you
there
i
see
you
damned
first
hurd
answered
savagely
get
in
letty
the
girl
hesitated
she
turned
to
macheson
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
station
and
wait
she
declared
i
think
macheson
said
that
you
had
better
trust
yourself
to
me
and
my
friend
i
am
sure
of
it
holderness
added
calmly
she
put
her
hand
in
macheson
she
was
as
pale
as
death
and
avoided
looking
at
hurd
he
took
a
quick
step
towards
her
very
well
young
lady
he
said
if
you
go
now
you
understand
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
she
began
to
cry
again
i
wish
she
murmured
that
i
had
never
seen
you
at
all
never
he
turned
on
his
heel
a
row
was
impossible
it
occurred
to
him
that
a
man
of
the
world
would
face
such
a
position
calmly
very
good
he
said
we
will
leave
it
at
that
he
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
and
strolled
back
down
the
street
towards
the
restaurant
which
they
had
just
left
letty
was
crying
now
in
good
earnest
the
two
young
men
looked
at
one
another
in
something
like
dismay
then
holderness
began
to
laugh
quietly
you
a
nice
sort
of
don
quixote
to
spend
an
evening
with
he
remarked
softly
chapter
xvii
the
victims
of
society
the
girl
was
still
crying
softly
but
persistently
she
caught
hold
of
macheson
arm
if
you
please
i
think
i
had
better
go
back
to
stephen
she
said
do
you
think
i
could
find
him
i
think
you
had
much
better
not
letty
he
answered
he
ought
not
to
have
let
you
miss
your
train
my
friend
here
and
i
are
going
to
look
after
you
it
very
kind
of
you
the
girl
said
listlessly
but
it
matter
much
what
becomes
of
me
now
mother
will
never
forgive
me
and
the
others
will
all
know
that
i
missed
the
train
we
must
think
of
some
way
of
putting
that
all
right
macheson
declared
i
only
wish
that
i
had
some
relations
in
london
can
you
suggest
anything
dick
i
can
take
the
young
lady
to
some
decent
rooms
holderness
answered
the
landlady
an
old
friend
of
mine
she
be
as
right
as
rain
there
the
girl
shook
her
head
i
as
soon
walk
about
the
streets
she
said
pathetically
never
listen
to
me
or
the
others
some
of
them
saw
me
with
stephen
and
they
said
things
i
think
i
go
to
the
station
and
wait
till
the
five
train
they
were
walking
slowly
up
towards
piccadilly
a
fine
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
already
the
pavements
were
shining
neither
of
them
had
an
umbrella
and
letty
hat
with
its
cheap
flowers
and
ribbon
showed
signs
of
collapse
suddenly
macheson
had
an
idea
look
here
he
said
supposing
you
spent
the
night
at
miss
house
in
berkeley
square
no
one
could
say
anything
then
could
they
the
girl
looked
up
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
hope
no
i
do
suppose
they
could
she
admitted
but
i
do
know
where
it
is
and
i
do
suppose
they
take
me
in
anyway
i
know
where
it
is
macheson
declared
and
we
see
about
their
taking
you
in
i
believe
miss
may
be
there
herself
stop
that
fourwheeler
dick
they
climbed
into
a
passing
cab
and
macheson
directed
the
driver
the
girl
was
beginning
to
lose
confidence
again
the
house
is
sure
to
be
shut
up
she
said
there
will
be
a
caretaker
macheson
declared
hopefully
we
manage
it
never
fear
i
believe
miss
is
there
herself
letty
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
fear
i
scared
to
death
of
her
she
admitted
she
so
beautiful
and
she
looks
at
you
always
as
though
you
were
something
a
long
way
off
macheson
was
suddenly
silent
a
rush
of
memories
surged
into
his
brain
he
had
sworn
to
keep
away
this
was
a
different
matter
an
errand
of
mercy
nevertheless
he
would
see
her
if
only
for
a
moment
his
heart
leaped
like
a
boy
he
looked
eagerly
out
of
the
window
already
they
were
entering
berkeley
square
the
cab
stopped
macheson
looked
upwards
there
were
lights
in
many
of
the
windows
and
a
small
electric
brougham
with
a
tall
footman
by
the
side
of
the
driver
was
waiting
opposite
the
door
the
house
is
open
he
declared
do
be
afraid
letty
the
girl
descended
and
clung
to
his
arm
as
they
crossed
the
pavement
i
shall
wait
here
for
you
holderness
said
good
luck
to
you
and
good
night
young
lady
macheson
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
at
once
by
a
footman
who
eyed
them
in
cold
surprise
we
wish
to
see
miss
for
two
minutes
macheson
said
producing
his
card
it
is
really
an
important
matter
or
we
would
not
disturb
her
at
such
an
hour
she
is
at
home
is
she
not
the
footman
looked
exceedingly
dubious
he
looked
from
the
card
to
macheson
and
from
macheson
to
the
girl
and
he
did
seem
to
like
either
of
them
miss
has
just
returned
from
the
opera
he
said
and
she
is
going
on
to
the
countess
of
annesley
ball
directly
ca
you
come
again
in
the
morning
quite
impossible
macheson
declared
briskly
i
am
sure
that
miss
will
see
me
for
a
moment
if
you
take
that
card
up
the
footman
studied
macheson
again
and
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
was
a
gentleman
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
miss
shall
have
your
card
sir
he
said
kindly
take
a
seat
he
left
the
room
macheson
drew
up
a
chair
for
letty
but
she
refused
it
trembling
oh
i
dare
sit
down
macheson
she
declared
and
please
say
that
i
was
with
hurd
i
know
he
would
like
it
probably
not
macheson
answered
but
what
am
i
to
say
anything
anything
but
that
she
begged
macheson
nodded
his
promise
then
the
door
opened
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
she
entered
the
room
in
all
the
glory
of
a
wonderful
toilette
she
wore
her
famous
ropes
of
pearls
the
spotless
white
of
her
gown
was
the
last
word
from
the
subtlest
parisian
workshop
of
the
day
but
it
was
not
these
things
that
counted
had
he
been
dreaming
he
wondered
a
moment
later
or
had
that
strange
smile
indeed
curved
her
lips
that
marvellous
light
indeed
flowed
from
her
eyes
it
was
the
lady
of
his
dreams
who
had
entered
it
was
a
very
different
woman
who
with
a
slight
frown
upon
her
smooth
forehead
was
looking
at
the
girl
who
stood
trembling
by
macheson
side
it
is
macheson
is
it
not
she
said
calmly
the
young
man
who
wanted
to
convert
my
villagers
and
you
who
are
you
she
asked
turning
to
the
girl
letty
foulton
if
you
please
the
girl
answered
foulton
letty
foulton
wilhelmina
repeated
yes
my
brother
has
onetree
farm
the
girl
continued
wilhelmina
inclined
her
head
ah
yes
she
remarked
i
remember
now
and
what
do
you
two
want
of
me
at
this
hour
of
the
night
she
asked
frigidly
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
explain
macheson
interrupted
eagerly
letty
came
up
from
thorpe
this
morning
on
an
excursion
train
which
returned
at
midnight
wilhelmina
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
five
minutes
to
one
well
she
missed
it
macheson
continued
it
was
very
careless
and
very
wrong
of
course
but
the
fact
remains
that
she
missed
it
i
found
her
in
great
distress
she
had
lost
her
friends
and
there
is
no
train
back
to
thorpe
till
the
morning
her
brother
and
mother
are
very
strict
and
all
her
friends
who
came
from
thorpe
will
of
course
know
that
she
remained
in
london
the
position
as
you
will
doubtless
realize
is
a
serious
one
for
her
wilhelmina
made
no
sign
nothing
in
her
face
answered
in
any
way
the
silent
appeal
in
his
i
happened
to
know
he
continued
that
you
were
in
london
so
i
ventured
to
bring
her
at
once
to
you
you
are
the
mistress
of
thorpe
and
in
our
recent
conversation
i
remember
you
admitted
a
certain
amount
of
responsibility
as
regards
your
people
there
if
she
passes
the
night
under
your
roof
no
one
can
have
a
word
to
say
it
will
save
her
at
once
from
her
parent
anger
and
the
undesirable
comments
of
her
neighbours
wilhelmina
glanced
once
more
towards
the
clock
it
seems
to
me
she
remarked
that
a
considerable
portion
of
the
night
has
already
passed
both
macheson
and
the
girl
were
silent
wilhelmina
for
the
first
time
addressed
the
latter
where
have
you
been
spending
the
evening
she
asked
we
had
dinner
and
went
to
a
place
of
entertainment
she
faltered
then
we
had
supper
and
i
found
out
how
late
it
was
who
is
we
the
girl
face
was
scarlet
she
did
not
answer
wilhelmina
waited
for
a
moment
and
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
are
to
be
congratulated
she
said
with
cold
irony
upon
your
fortunate
meeting
with
mr
macheson
she
had
touched
the
bell
and
a
footman
entered
reynolds
she
said
show
this
young
person
into
the
room
and
ask
brown
to
take
charge
of
her
for
the
night
the
girl
moved
forward
impulsively
but
something
in
expression
checked
her
little
speech
of
gratitude
she
followed
the
man
from
the
room
without
a
word
wilhelmina
also
turned
towards
the
door
you
will
excuse
me
she
said
coldly
to
macheson
i
am
already
later
than
i
intended
to
be
i
can
only
apologize
for
disturbing
you
at
such
an
hour
he
answered
taking
up
his
hat
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
she
looked
at
him
coldly
the
girl
parents
she
said
are
respectable
people
and
i
am
sheltering
her
for
their
sake
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
consider
her
story
most
unsatisfactory
they
were
standing
in
the
hall
she
had
paused
on
her
way
out
to
conclude
her
sentence
her
maid
holding
out
a
wonderful
opera
cloak
was
standing
a
few
yards
away
a
was
waiting
at
the
door
with
the
handle
in
his
hand
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
and
macheson
felt
the
challenge
which
flashed
out
from
them
she
imagined
then
that
he
had
been
the
girl
companion
the
cold
disdain
of
her
manner
was
in
itself
an
accusation
his
cheeks
burned
with
a
sort
of
shame
she
had
dared
to
think
this
of
him
and
that
afterwards
he
should
have
brought
the
girl
to
her
to
beg
for
shelter
there
were
a
dozen
things
which
he
ought
to
have
said
which
came
flashing
from
his
brain
to
find
themselves
somehow
imprisoned
behind
his
tightly
locked
lips
he
said
nothing
she
passed
slowly
almost
unwillingly
down
the
hall
the
maid
wrapped
her
coat
around
her
still
he
stood
like
a
statue
he
watched
her
pass
through
the
opened
door
and
enter
the
electric
brougham
he
watched
it
even
glide
away
then
he
too
went
and
joined
holderness
who
was
waiting
outside
hail
succourer
of
damsels
in
distress
holderness
called
out
producing
his
jolly
glad
you
got
rid
of
her
it
would
have
meant
the
at
pancras
and
an
sitting
smoke
my
son
and
we
will
walk
home
unless
you
mind
this
bit
of
rain
was
her
ladyship
gracious
she
was
not
macheson
answered
grimly
but
she
is
keeping
the
girl
i
like
to
walk
he
added
lighting
a
cigar
a
very
elegant
lady
holderness
remarked
but
i
thought
she
looked
a
bit
up
in
the
air
did
you
notice
her
pearls
victor
macheson
nodded
wonderful
were
they
yes
she
wears
them
round
her
neck
and
these
these
wear
always
their
shame
he
added
pushing
gently
away
a
woman
who
clutched
at
his
arm
funny
thing
is
it
what
are
they
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
very
likely
a
lot
of
money
for
gewgaws
to
hang
upon
a
woman
body
shall
we
ever
have
a
revolution
in
london
do
you
think
victor
who
knows
macheson
answered
wearily
not
a
political
one
perhaps
but
the
other
might
come
the
sewers
underneath
are
pretty
full
they
passed
along
in
silence
for
a
few
minutes
neither
the
drizzling
rain
nor
the
lateness
of
the
hour
could
keep
away
that
weary
procession
of
sad
women
who
seemed
to
come
from
every
shadow
and
vanish
heaven
knows
where
macheson
gripped
his
companion
by
the
arm
holderness
he
cried
for
god
sake
let
get
out
of
it
i
shall
choke
presently
we
take
a
side
street
but
holderness
held
his
arm
in
a
grip
of
iron
no
he
said
these
are
the
things
which
you
must
feel
i
want
you
to
feel
them
i
mean
you
to
it
dick
holderness
smiled
faintly
i
know
how
you
feel
he
declared
i
gone
through
it
myself
you
are
a
christian
are
you
almost
an
orthodox
christian
i
am
not
sure
do
waste
your
pity
then
holderness
declared
god
will
look
after
these
it
the
women
with
the
pearl
necklaces
and
the
scorn
in
their
eyes
who
looking
for
hell
your
friend
in
the
electric
brougham
for
instance
ca
you
see
her
close
her
eyes
and
draw
away
her
skirts
if
she
should
brush
up
against
one
of
these
it
hard
to
blame
her
macheson
declared
holderness
looked
down
at
him
pityingly
man
he
said
you
a
long
way
down
in
the
valley
you
have
to
climb
vice
and
virtue
are
little
else
save
relative
terms
they
number
their
adherents
by
accident
rather
than
choice
you
mean
that
it
is
all
a
matter
of
temptation
holderness
laughed
they
had
passed
into
the
land
of
silent
streets
their
own
rooms
were
close
at
hand
wait
a
little
time
he
said
some
day
you
understand
chapter
xviii
letty
dilemma
you
are
quite
sure
the
girl
said
anxiously
that
miss
wants
to
see
me
you
see
there
a
train
at
ten
i
could
catch
the
housekeeper
looked
up
from
the
menu
she
was
writing
and
tapped
the
table
impatiently
with
her
pencil
my
dear
child
she
said
is
it
likely
i
should
keep
you
here
without
orders
we
have
sent
a
telegram
to
your
mother
and
you
are
to
wait
until
the
mistress
is
ready
to
see
you
what
time
does
she
generally
get
down
letty
asked
any
time
brown
answered
resuming
her
task
she
was
back
early
last
night
only
stayed
an
hour
at
the
ball
so
she
may
send
for
you
at
any
moment
do
fidget
about
so
there
a
good
girl
i
nervous
this
morning
we
people
dining
and
i
have
an
idea
in
my
head
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
send
for
françois
is
françois
the
who
comes
down
to
thorpe
letty
asked
brown
nodded
the
you
should
call
him
she
answered
a
very
clever
man
no
doubt
in
his
way
but
takes
a
lot
of
keeping
in
order
do
you
have
to
look
after
all
the
servants
letty
asked
does
miss
ever
order
anything
brown
looked
pityingly
at
her
guest
my
dear
child
she
said
i
doubt
if
she
could
tell
you
to
three
or
four
how
many
servants
there
are
in
the
house
and
as
to
ordering
anything
i
do
suppose
such
a
thought
ever
entered
into
her
head
here
james
coming
perhaps
it
a
message
for
you
a
footman
entered
and
greeted
letty
kindly
good
morning
young
lady
he
said
you
are
to
go
into
the
at
once
letty
rose
with
alacrity
is
is
she
there
she
asked
nervously
she
is
the
man
answered
and
if
i
were
you
miss
i
would
do
much
more
than
just
answer
her
questions
and
skedaddle
i
have
had
any
conversation
with
her
myself
but
mademoiselle
says
she
more
than
a
bit
off
it
this
morning
slept
badly
or
something
do
frighten
the
child
james
brown
said
reprovingly
not
likely
to
say
much
to
you
my
dear
you
hurry
along
and
come
back
and
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
biscuit
before
you
go
show
her
the
way
james
if
you
please
miss
the
man
answered
becoming
once
more
an
automaton
letty
was
ushered
into
a
small
room
full
it
seemed
to
her
as
she
entered
of
sunshine
and
flowers
wilhelmina
in
a
plain
gown
with
a
string
of
beads
around
her
neck
of
some
shade
of
blue
was
sitting
in
a
a
small
wood
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
filling
the
room
with
a
pleasant
aromatic
odour
and
the
window
leading
into
the
square
was
thrown
wide
open
on
a
table
by
her
side
were
a
pile
of
letters
an
ivory
several
newspapers
and
a
silver
box
of
cigarettes
for
the
moment
however
none
of
these
things
claimed
her
attention
the
lady
of
the
house
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
her
eyes
were
half
closed
if
she
had
not
been
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
light
letty
might
have
noticed
the
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
slept
well
letty
advanced
doubtfully
into
the
room
wilhelmina
turned
her
head
oh
it
is
you
she
remarked
come
up
to
the
table
where
i
can
see
you
brown
told
me
that
you
wished
to
see
me
before
i
went
the
girl
said
hesitatingly
wilhelmina
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
was
looking
at
the
girl
yes
she
was
pretty
in
a
rustic
uncultured
way
her
figure
was
unformed
her
hands
and
feet
what
might
have
been
expected
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
lacked
taste
were
men
really
attracted
by
this
sort
of
thing
yes
wilhelmina
said
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
i
am
not
altogether
satisfied
about
last
night
letty
said
nothing
she
went
red
and
then
white
examination
of
her
was
merciless
i
wish
to
know
wilhelmina
said
who
your
companion
was
with
whom
you
had
dinner
and
supper
i
look
upon
that
person
as
being
responsible
for
your
lost
train
letty
prayed
that
she
might
sink
into
the
ground
her
worst
imaginings
had
not
been
so
bad
as
this
she
remained
silent
i
waiting
wilhelmina
said
mercilessly
i
suppose
it
is
obvious
enough
but
i
wish
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
i
he
i
do
think
that
he
would
like
me
to
tell
you
she
faltered
wilhelmina
smiled
unpleasantly
probably
not
she
answered
that
however
is
beside
the
question
i
wish
to
know
the
girl
was
desperate
it
was
indeed
a
quandary
with
her
to
offend
the
mistress
of
thorpe
was
something
like
sacrilege
but
she
knew
very
well
what
stephen
would
have
had
her
do
if
you
please
she
said
at
last
i
ca
wilhelmina
said
nothing
for
a
moment
only
her
eyebrows
were
slowly
lifted
if
you
do
not
she
said
calmly
i
must
write
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
what
i
think
of
your
behaviour
last
night
i
do
not
care
to
have
people
near
me
who
are
disobedient
or
foolish
the
girl
burst
into
tears
wilhelmina
watched
her
with
cold
patience
i
presume
she
said
that
it
was
macheson
you
do
not
need
to
mention
his
name
you
need
only
say
the
girl
said
nothing
macheson
lodged
with
your
mother
i
believe
wilhelmina
continued
yes
the
girl
whispered
and
you
waited
upon
him
yes
the
girl
lifted
her
head
macheson
always
behaved
like
a
gentleman
to
me
she
said
wilhelmina
regarded
her
contemptuously
your
ideas
of
what
constitutes
gentlemanly
behaviour
are
probably
primitive
she
said
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
trouble
you
for
any
direct
answer
still
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
give
it
the
girl
was
again
silent
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
footman
ushered
in
stephen
hurd
he
entered
confident
and
smiling
he
was
wearing
a
new
grey
tweed
suit
and
he
was
pleased
with
himself
and
the
summons
which
had
brought
him
to
london
but
the
sight
of
the
girl
took
his
breath
away
she
too
was
utterly
taken
by
surprise
and
forgot
herself
stephen
she
exclaimed
taking
a
quick
step
towards
him
you
you
here
he
answered
it
was
quite
enough
but
what
puzzled
letty
was
that
wilhelmina
did
not
seem
in
the
least
angry
there
was
a
strange
look
on
her
face
as
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
something
had
sprung
into
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
transform
her
her
voice
too
had
lost
all
its
hardness
how
do
you
do
mr
hurd
she
said
i
hope
you
have
come
to
explain
how
you
dared
let
this
child
lose
her
train
last
night
i
really
i
it
was
quite
a
mistake
he
faltered
darting
an
angry
glance
at
letty
you
had
supper
with
her
wilhelmina
said
and
you
knew
what
time
the
train
went
she
met
some
other
friends
stephen
answered
she
left
me
wilhelmina
smiled
she
had
found
out
all
that
she
wanted
to
know
well
she
said
i
wo
inquire
too
closely
into
it
this
time
only
i
hope
that
nothing
of
the
sort
will
occur
again
you
had
better
have
lunch
with
brown
in
the
housekeeper
room
letty
and
i
send
you
over
to
pancras
for
the
four
train
i
give
you
a
letter
to
your
mother
this
time
but
mind
no
more
foolishness
of
this
sort
the
girl
tried
to
stammer
out
her
thanks
but
she
was
almost
incoherent
wilhelmina
dismissed
her
with
a
smile
her
manner
was
distinctly
colder
when
she
turned
to
hurd
hurd
she
said
i
hope
you
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
i
do
not
care
to
have
my
agent
or
any
one
connected
with
the
estate
play
the
don
juan
amongst
my
tenants
daughters
he
flushed
up
to
the
eyes
it
was
idiotic
of
me
he
admitted
frankly
i
simply
meant
to
give
the
child
a
good
time
she
is
quite
pretty
in
her
way
wilhelmina
said
and
her
parents
i
believe
are
most
respectable
people
you
were
perhaps
thinking
of
settling
down
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
what
with
letty
foulton
he
exclaimed
why
not
she
asked
he
drew
a
breath
through
his
teeth
he
could
scarcely
trust
himself
to
speak
for
anger
you
are
not
serious
he
permitted
himself
to
ask
why
not
she
demanded
hurd
struggled
to
express
himself
with
dignity
i
should
not
consider
such
a
marriage
a
suitable
one
even
if
i
were
thinking
of
marrying
at
all
he
said
she
raised
her
eyebrows
no
well
i
suppose
you
know
best
she
said
carelessly
is
there
anything
fresh
down
at
thorpe
she
was
angry
about
that
fool
of
a
girl
he
told
himself
a
good
sign
but
what
an
actress
his
conceit
barely
kept
him
up
there
really
is
anything
i
could
arrange
with
fields
he
admitted
i
thought
perhaps
as
i
was
up
you
might
have
some
special
instructions
that
is
why
i
sent
to
ask
if
you
would
see
me
he
looked
at
her
almost
eagerly
after
all
she
was
the
same
woman
who
had
been
kind
to
him
at
thorpe
and
yet
was
she
a
sudden
thought
startled
him
she
was
changed
had
she
guessed
that
he
knew
her
secret
no
she
said
deliberately
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
anything
if
you
could
find
out
macheson
address
i
should
be
much
obliged
hurd
was
puzzled
this
was
the
second
time
what
could
she
have
to
say
to
macheson
he
was
here
last
night
but
i
forgot
to
ask
him
she
continued
equably
macheson
here
he
exclaimed
it
was
he
who
brought
the
girl
letty
she
said
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
he
a
queer
lot
he
said
came
to
thorpe
of
all
places
as
a
sort
of
missioner
and
he
was
about
town
last
night
most
immaculately
got
up
nothing
of
the
parson
about
him
i
can
assure
you
no
she
answered
quietly
well
if
you
can
discover
his
address
remember
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
it
he
took
up
his
hat
reluctantly
he
had
hoped
at
least
that
he
might
have
been
asked
to
luncheon
it
was
obvious
however
that
he
was
expected
to
depart
and
he
did
so
on
the
whole
although
he
had
escaped
from
an
exceedingly
awkward
situation
he
could
scarcely
consider
his
visit
a
success
on
his
way
out
he
passed
deyes
stepping
out
of
a
cab
piled
up
with
luggage
he
nodded
to
hurd
in
a
friendly
manner
miss
in
he
asked
just
left
her
hurd
answered
deyes
passed
on
and
was
received
by
the
butler
as
a
favoured
guest
he
was
shown
at
once
into
the
chapter
xix
a
report
from
paris
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
deyes
declared
accepting
the
cigarette
and
the
i
have
appreciated
paris
i
have
gone
there
as
a
tourist
i
have
drunk
strange
drinks
at
the
café
de
la
paix
i
have
sat
upon
the
boulevards
and
ogled
the
obvious
lady
and
my
little
guide
she
asked
has
disappeared
he
answered
since
when
a
month
ago
it
is
reported
that
he
came
to
england
wilhelmina
sat
still
for
several
moments
to
a
casual
observer
she
might
have
seemed
unmoved
deyes
however
was
watching
her
closely
and
he
understood
i
am
sorry
he
said
to
have
so
little
to
tell
you
but
that
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
it
the
man
had
gone
away
that
is
precisely
what
i
desired
to
ascertain
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
possible
that
the
man
had
come
to
england
i
wished
to
know
for
certain
whether
it
was
true
or
not
i
think
deyes
said
withdrawing
his
cigarette
and
looking
at
it
thoughtfully
that
it
is
true
you
have
any
further
reason
for
thinking
so
she
asked
beyond
your
casual
inquiries
well
yes
he
admitted
i
went
a
little
farther
than
those
casual
inquiries
it
seemed
such
a
meagre
report
to
bring
you
go
on
the
ordinary
person
he
continued
smoothly
would
never
believe
the
extreme
difficulty
with
which
one
collects
any
particulars
as
to
the
home
life
of
a
guide
more
than
once
i
felt
inclined
to
give
up
the
task
in
despair
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
guide
could
have
no
home
that
he
must
sleep
in
odd
moments
on
a
bench
at
the
de
i
tried
to
fancy
a
guide
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
carving
a
sunday
joint
and
surrounded
by
guide
and
the
little
guides
i
could
do
it
it
seemed
to
me
somehow
grotesque
just
as
i
was
giving
it
up
in
despair
the
commissionaire
at
a
night
café
in
montmartre
told
me
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
know
he
showed
me
the
house
where
johnny
as
they
called
him
had
a
room
you
went
there
she
asked
i
did
he
answered
it
was
locked
up
on
the
contrary
he
declared
or
miss
guide
was
at
home
and
very
pleased
to
see
me
there
was
a
woman
there
assuredly
whether
she
is
there
now
or
not
i
can
not
say
for
it
is
three
days
ago
and
to
me
she
seemed
nearer
than
that
to
death
and
about
this
woman
what
was
she
like
was
she
his
wife
or
his
daughter
he
called
her
his
daughter
i
am
not
sure
about
the
relationship
she
had
been
i
should
say
but
she
was
very
what
did
she
tell
you
about
the
man
johnson
that
he
had
gone
to
england
to
try
to
get
some
money
they
were
almost
destitute
he
was
a
good
guide
she
said
but
people
came
so
often
to
paris
and
they
liked
some
one
fresh
then
she
coughed
how
she
coughed
did
she
tell
you
to
what
part
of
england
the
man
johnson
had
gone
i
asked
her
but
she
was
not
sure
i
do
not
believe
that
she
knew
she
said
that
there
was
some
one
in
england
who
was
very
rich
and
from
whom
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
get
money
anything
else
no
i
spoke
of
myself
as
an
old
client
of
johnny
and
i
left
money
afterwards
at
the
café
where
i
lunched
i
found
a
commissionaire
who
told
me
more
about
our
friend
ah
what
was
the
name
of
the
café
the
café
de
paris
she
took
up
a
screen
and
held
it
before
her
face
there
seemed
to
be
little
need
of
it
however
for
her
cheeks
were
as
pale
as
the
white
roses
by
her
side
this
man
johnny
as
they
call
him
deyes
continued
seems
to
have
had
his
ups
and
downs
one
big
stroke
of
luck
he
had
however
which
seems
to
have
kept
him
going
for
several
years
the
commissionaire
was
able
to
tell
me
something
about
it
shall
i
go
on
he
asked
dropping
his
voice
a
little
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
commissionaire
told
you
she
answered
somehow
or
other
this
fellow
johnny
or
johnson
as
some
of
them
called
him
was
recommended
to
a
young
lady
a
very
young
lady
who
was
in
paris
with
an
invalid
chaperon
stop
she
cried
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
you
were
that
young
lady
he
said
softly
of
course
i
know
that
i
was
she
admitted
do
speak
to
me
for
a
few
moments
it
was
years
ago
but
she
bent
the
screen
which
she
held
in
her
hand
until
the
handle
snapped
you
seem
she
said
to
have
rather
exceeded
your
instructions
i
simply
wanted
to
know
whether
the
man
was
in
paris
or
not
he
bowed
the
man
is
in
england
he
said
do
you
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
you
gave
me
more
of
your
confidence
and
told
me
why
you
wanted
to
hear
about
him
she
shook
her
head
i
would
sooner
tell
you
than
any
one
gilbert
she
said
but
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
it
it
must
be
as
you
will
of
course
he
answered
but
i
hope
you
will
always
remember
that
you
could
do
me
no
greater
kindness
at
any
time
than
to
make
use
of
my
services
i
do
not
know
everything
of
what
happened
in
paris
about
that
time
i
do
not
wish
to
know
i
am
content
to
serve
you
blindly
i
will
not
forget
that
she
said
softly
if
ever
the
necessity
comes
i
will
remind
you
there
let
that
be
the
end
of
it
she
changed
the
subject
giving
him
to
understand
that
she
did
not
wish
to
discuss
it
further
you
are
for
marienbad
as
usual
she
asked
next
week
he
answered
one
goes
from
habit
i
suppose
no
waters
upon
the
earth
or
under
it
will
ever
cure
me
liver
she
asked
heart
he
declared
you
should
smoke
so
many
cigarettes
harmless
he
assured
her
i
do
inhale
i
think
she
said
that
i
shall
come
over
next
month
do
he
begged
i
answer
for
the
bridge
may
i
come
and
lunch
she
turned
to
a
red
morocco
book
by
her
side
a
bishop
and
lady
sarah
she
said
several
more
parsons
and
i
think
the
duchess
i
face
he
declared
i
think
i
shall
send
for
peggy
wilhelmina
said
she
is
always
so
sweet
to
the
church
deyes
grinned
i
shall
go
round
and
look
her
up
he
declared
perhaps
she
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
somewhere
she
held
out
her
hand
you
a
good
sort
to
have
gone
over
for
me
she
said
the
things
you
tumbled
up
against
you
better
forget
until
you
remind
me
of
them
he
said
very
well
i
do
that
sorry
i
did
run
johnny
to
earth
he
went
off
and
wilhelmina
after
a
few
minutes
went
to
her
desk
and
wrote
a
letter
to
stephen
hurd
as
usual
she
wrote
when
you
were
here
this
morning
i
forgot
to
mention
several
matters
upon
which
i
meant
to
speak
to
you
the
first
is
with
regard
to
the
man
whose
brutal
assault
upon
your
father
caused
his
death
i
understand
that
the
police
have
never
traced
him
have
never
even
found
the
slightest
clue
to
his
whereabouts
the
more
i
think
of
this
the
more
strange
it
seems
to
me
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
he
never
after
all
escaped
from
the
wood
in
which
he
first
took
shelter
i
know
that
the
slate
quarry
was
dragged
at
the
time
but
i
have
been
told
that
this
was
hastily
done
and
that
there
are
several
very
deep
holes
into
which
the
man
body
may
have
drifted
i
wish
you
therefore
to
send
over
to
nottingham
to
get
some
experienced
men
to
bring
back
the
drags
and
make
an
exhaustive
search
please
have
this
done
without
delay
further
i
wish
to
communicate
with
the
young
man
macheson
who
was
in
thorpe
at
the
time
they
may
know
his
address
at
the
but
if
you
are
unable
to
procure
it
in
any
other
way
you
must
advertise
in
your
own
name
please
carry
out
my
instructions
in
these
two
matters
immediately
wilhelmina
laid
down
her
pen
and
looked
thoughtfully
through
the
window
into
the
square
a
policeman
was
coming
slowly
along
the
pavement
she
watched
him
approach
and
pass
the
house
his
eyes
still
fixed
in
front
of
him
his
whole
appearance
stolid
and
to
the
last
degree
she
watched
him
disappear
with
fascinated
eyes
after
all
he
represented
great
things
behind
him
was
a
whole
national
code
the
machinery
of
which
he
was
so
small
a
part
drove
the
wheels
of
life
or
death
she
turned
away
from
the
window
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
humming
a
tune
she
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
began
the
leisurely
perusal
of
her
letters
chapter
xx
like
a
trapped
animal
macheson
in
those
days
felt
himself
rapidly
growing
older
an
immeasurable
gap
seemed
to
lie
between
him
and
the
eager
young
apostle
who
had
plunged
so
into
the
stress
of
life
all
that
wonderful
enthusiasm
that
undaunted
courage
with
which
he
had
faced
coldness
and
ridicule
in
the
earlier
days
of
his
vocation
seemed
to
have
left
him
some
way
somehow
he
seemed
to
have
suffered
shipwreck
there
was
poison
in
his
system
fight
against
it
as
he
might
and
he
did
fight
there
were
moments
when
memory
turned
the
life
which
he
had
taken
up
so
solemnly
into
the
maddest
most
fantastic
fairy
story
at
such
times
his
blood
ran
riot
the
sweetness
of
a
strange
unknown
world
seemed
to
be
calling
to
him
across
the
forbidden
borders
inaction
wearied
him
horribly
and
after
all
it
was
inaction
which
holderness
had
recommended
as
the
best
means
of
himself
in
a
saner
and
more
normal
attitude
towards
life
look
round
a
bit
old
chap
he
advised
and
think
do
do
anything
in
a
hurry
you
young
shockingly
young
for
any
effective
work
you
ca
teach
before
you
understand
life
is
such
a
sink
of
iniquity
as
you
young
prigs
at
oxford
professed
to
find
it
see
the
best
of
it
and
the
worst
you
be
able
to
put
your
finger
on
the
weak
spots
quick
enough
but
the
process
of
looking
around
wearied
macheson
excessively
or
was
it
something
else
which
had
crept
into
his
blood
to
his
immense
unsettlement
there
were
several
philanthropic
schemes
started
by
himself
and
his
college
friends
in
full
swing
now
in
or
about
london
to
each
of
them
he
paid
some
attention
studying
its
workings
listening
to
the
enthusiastic
outpourings
of
his
quondam
friends
and
doing
his
best
to
catch
at
least
some
spark
of
their
interest
but
it
was
all
very
unsatisfactory
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
felt
the
insistent
craving
for
some
fiercer
excitement
some
mode
of
life
which
should
make
larger
and
deeper
demands
upon
his
emotional
temperament
a
heroic
war
would
have
appealed
to
him
instantly
for
that
he
realized
with
a
sigh
he
was
born
many
centuries
too
late
for
weeks
he
wandered
about
london
in
a
highly
unsatisfied
condition
then
one
afternoon
in
the
waning
of
a
misty
october
day
he
came
face
to
face
with
wilhelmina
in
bond
street
she
was
stepping
into
her
motor
brougham
when
she
saw
him
he
had
no
opportunity
for
escape
even
if
he
had
desired
it
her
tired
lips
were
suddenly
curved
into
a
most
bewildering
smile
she
withdrew
her
hand
from
her
muff
and
offered
it
to
him
for
the
first
time
so
you
are
still
in
london
macheson
she
said
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
the
words
were
unlike
her
the
tone
was
such
as
he
had
never
heard
her
use
do
what
he
could
he
could
not
help
the
answering
light
which
sprang
into
his
own
eyes
i
am
still
in
london
he
said
i
thought
you
were
to
go
to
marienbad
i
left
it
until
it
was
too
late
she
answered
walk
a
little
way
with
me
she
added
abruptly
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
if
i
may
he
answered
simply
she
dismissed
the
brougham
and
they
moved
on
i
am
sorry
she
began
that
i
was
rude
to
you
when
you
brought
that
girl
to
me
you
did
exactly
what
was
nice
and
kind
and
i
was
hateful
please
forgive
me
of
course
he
answered
simply
i
felt
sure
that
when
you
thought
it
over
you
would
understand
you
are
not
going
back
to
thorpe
she
asked
not
at
present
at
any
rate
he
answered
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
faint
smile
you
can
have
the
barn
she
said
his
eyes
answered
her
smile
but
his
tone
was
grave
i
have
given
that
up
for
a
little
time
at
any
rate
he
said
i
mean
that
particular
sort
of
work
my
villagers
must
content
themselves
with
vardon
then
she
remarked
he
nodded
perhaps
he
said
ours
was
a
mistaken
enterprise
i
am
not
sure
but
at
any
rate
so
far
as
thorpe
is
concerned
i
have
abandoned
it
for
the
present
she
was
walking
close
to
his
side
so
close
that
the
hand
which
raised
her
skirt
as
they
crossed
the
street
touched
his
and
her
soft
breath
as
she
leaned
over
and
spoke
fell
upon
his
cheek
why
he
felt
the
insidious
meaning
of
her
whispered
monosyllable
he
felt
her
eyes
striving
to
make
him
look
at
her
his
cheeks
were
flushed
but
he
looked
steadily
ahead
there
were
several
reasons
he
said
do
tell
me
she
begged
i
am
curious
for
one
he
said
steadily
i
did
an
unjust
thing
at
thorpe
i
sheltered
a
criminal
and
helped
him
to
escape
so
it
was
you
who
did
that
she
remarked
you
mean
of
course
the
man
who
killed
mr
hurd
yes
he
answered
i
showed
him
where
to
hide
he
either
got
clean
away
or
he
is
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
slate
quarry
in
either
case
i
am
responsible
for
him
well
she
said
he
is
not
at
the
bottom
of
the
slate
quarry
i
can
at
least
assure
you
of
that
i
have
had
the
place
dragged
and
every
foot
of
it
gone
over
by
experienced
men
from
nottingham
really
he
said
surprised
well
i
am
glad
of
it
she
sighed
i
want
you
if
you
can
she
said
to
describe
the
man
to
me
it
is
not
altogether
curiosity
i
have
a
reason
for
wishing
to
know
what
he
was
like
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
panic
macheson
said
doubtfully
that
i
am
afraid
i
have
only
an
imperfect
impression
of
him
he
was
not
very
tall
he
had
a
round
face
cheeks
that
were
generally
i
should
think
rather
brown
eyes
and
dark
hair
almost
black
he
wore
a
thick
gold
ring
on
the
finger
of
one
hand
and
although
he
spoke
good
english
i
got
the
idea
somehow
that
he
was
either
a
foreigner
or
had
lived
abroad
he
was
in
a
terrible
state
of
fear
and
from
what
i
could
gather
i
should
say
that
he
struck
old
hurd
in
a
scuffle
and
not
with
any
deliberate
intention
of
hurting
him
she
nodded
i
have
heard
all
that
i
want
to
she
declared
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
several
minutes
then
she
turned
to
him
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
the
subject
she
declared
is
dismissed
i
did
not
ask
you
to
walk
with
me
to
discuss
such
unpleasant
things
i
should
like
to
know
about
yourself
he
sighed
about
myself
he
answered
there
is
nothing
to
tell
there
is
in
the
whole
of
london
a
more
unsatisfactory
person
she
laughed
softly
such
delightful
humility
she
murmured
especially
amongst
the
young
is
too
touching
nevertheless
go
on
it
amuses
me
to
hear
the
note
of
imperiousness
in
her
tone
was
pleasantly
reminiscent
it
was
the
first
reminder
he
had
received
of
the
great
lady
of
thorpe
well
he
said
what
do
you
want
to
know
everything
she
answered
i
am
possessed
by
a
most
unholy
curiosity
your
relatives
for
instance
and
where
you
were
born
he
shook
his
head
i
have
no
relatives
he
answered
i
was
born
in
australia
i
am
an
orphan
years
old
and
feel
no
profession
no
settled
purpose
in
life
i
am
japhet
in
search
of
a
career
she
glanced
at
his
shabby
clothes
he
had
been
to
a
in
the
east
end
you
are
poor
she
asked
softly
i
have
enough
more
than
enough
he
answered
to
live
on
her
eyes
lingered
upon
his
clothes
but
he
offered
no
explanation
enough
to
live
on
she
reflected
might
mean
anything
you
say
that
you
have
no
profession
she
remarked
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
a
vocation
but
why
did
you
want
to
come
and
preach
to
my
villagers
at
thorpe
why
did
you
go
into
the
church
if
you
cared
for
that
sort
of
thing
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
dogma
in
the
way
he
answered
i
should
make
but
a
poor
churchman
they
would
probably
call
me
a
besides
i
wanted
my
independence
she
nodded
i
am
beginning
to
understand
a
little
better
she
said
now
you
must
tell
me
this
why
did
you
entertain
the
idea
of
mission
work
in
a
place
like
thorpe
when
the
whole
of
that
awful
east
end
was
there
waiting
for
you
all
the
world
of
reformers
he
answered
rushes
to
the
east
end
we
fancied
there
was
as
important
work
to
be
done
in
less
obvious
places
and
you
started
your
work
she
asked
directly
you
left
college
before
i
think
he
answered
you
see
i
was
alone
there
were
several
of
us
who
felt
the
same
way
holderness
for
instance
the
man
who
came
to
your
house
with
me
the
other
night
he
works
altogether
upon
the
political
side
he
a
socialist
of
a
sort
two
of
the
others
went
into
the
church
one
became
a
medical
missionary
i
joined
in
with
a
few
who
thought
that
we
might
do
more
effective
work
without
tying
ourselves
down
to
anything
or
subscribing
to
any
religious
denomination
she
looked
at
him
curiously
he
was
tall
and
muscular
he
wore
even
his
shabby
clothes
with
an
air
of
distinction
i
suppose
she
said
calmly
that
i
must
belong
to
a
very
different
world
but
what
i
can
not
understand
is
why
you
should
choose
a
career
which
you
intend
to
pursue
apparently
for
the
benefit
of
other
people
all
the
young
men
whom
i
have
known
who
have
taken
life
seriously
enough
to
embrace
a
career
at
all
have
at
least
studied
their
individual
tastes
well
he
answered
smiling
it
is
that
i
fancy
myself
any
better
than
my
fellows
i
was
at
magdalen
you
know
under
heysey
i
think
that
it
was
his
influence
which
shaped
our
ideas
yes
i
have
heard
of
him
she
said
thoughtfully
he
was
a
good
man
at
least
every
one
says
so
i
afraid
i
do
know
much
about
good
men
myself
most
of
those
whom
i
have
met
have
been
the
other
sort
the
faint
bitterness
of
her
tone
troubled
him
there
was
deliberation
too
in
her
words
instinctively
he
knew
that
this
was
no
idle
speech
you
have
asked
me
he
reminded
her
a
good
many
questions
i
wonder
if
i
might
be
permitted
to
ask
you
one
why
not
i
can
reserve
the
privilege
of
not
answering
it
she
remarked
people
call
you
a
fortunate
woman
he
said
you
are
very
rich
you
have
a
splendid
home
the
choice
of
your
own
friends
a
certain
reputation
forgive
me
if
i
quote
from
a
society
paper
as
a
brilliant
and
popular
woman
of
the
world
yours
is
rather
a
unique
position
it
i
wonder
he
added
whether
you
are
satisfied
with
what
you
get
out
of
life
i
get
all
that
there
is
to
be
got
she
answered
a
slight
hardness
creeping
into
her
tone
it
may
be
much
but
it
amuses
me
sometimes
he
shook
his
head
there
is
more
to
be
got
out
of
life
he
said
than
a
little
amusement
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
how
about
yourself
you
have
exactly
the
appearance
of
a
perfectly
contented
being
i
hideously
dissatisfied
he
admitted
promptly
something
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
with
me
i
seem
to
have
become
a
at
life
i
want
to
take
a
hand
and
i
ca
there
does
seem
to
be
any
place
for
me
of
course
it
only
a
phase
he
continued
i
shall
settle
down
into
something
presently
but
it
rather
beastly
while
it
lasts
she
looked
at
him
her
eyes
soft
with
laughter
somehow
his
confession
seemed
to
have
delighted
her
i
glad
you
are
human
enough
to
have
phases
she
declared
i
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
you
might
turn
out
to
be
just
an
ordinary
superior
person
perhaps
you
are
also
human
enough
to
drink
tea
and
eat
muffins
try
wo
you
they
were
in
front
of
her
door
which
flew
immediately
open
she
either
took
his
consent
for
granted
or
chose
not
to
risk
his
refusal
for
she
went
on
ahead
and
his
faint
protests
were
unheard
his
hat
and
stick
passed
into
the
care
of
an
elderly
person
in
plain
black
clothes
with
scarcely
an
effort
at
resistance
he
found
himself
following
her
down
the
hall
she
stopped
before
a
small
gate
which
a
footman
at
once
threw
open
it
makes
one
feel
as
though
one
were
in
a
hotel
does
it
she
remarked
but
i
hate
stairs
besides
i
am
going
to
take
you
a
long
long
way
up
i
am
not
at
home
this
afternoon
groves
very
good
madam
the
man
answered
they
stepped
out
into
a
smaller
hall
a
young
woman
came
hurrying
forward
to
meet
them
i
shall
not
need
you
annette
wilhelmina
said
go
down
and
see
that
they
send
up
tea
for
two
and
telephone
to
lady
margaret
say
i
sorry
that
i
can
not
call
for
her
this
afternoon
parfaitement
madame
the
girl
murmured
and
hurried
away
wilhelmina
opened
the
door
of
a
the
most
wonderful
apartment
macheson
had
ever
seen
a
sudden
nervousness
seized
him
he
felt
his
knees
shaking
his
heart
began
to
thump
his
brain
to
swim
all
at
once
he
realized
where
he
was
it
was
not
the
lady
of
thorpe
this
it
was
the
woman
who
had
come
to
him
with
the
storm
the
woman
who
had
set
burning
the
flame
which
had
driven
him
into
a
new
world
he
looked
around
half
wildly
he
felt
suddenly
like
a
trapped
animal
it
was
no
place
for
him
this
bower
of
roses
and
cushions
and
all
the
voluptuous
appurtenances
of
a
chamber
subtly
and
irresistibly
feminine
he
was
bereft
of
words
awkward
embarrassed
he
longed
passionately
to
escape
wilhelmina
closed
the
door
and
raised
her
veil
she
laid
her
two
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
faint
but
very
tender
smile
her
forehead
was
slightly
wrinkled
her
fingers
seemed
to
cling
to
him
so
that
her
very
touch
was
like
a
caress
his
heart
began
to
beat
madly
the
perfume
of
her
clothes
her
hair
the
violets
at
her
bosom
were
like
a
new
and
delicious
form
of
intoxication
the
touch
of
her
fingers
became
more
insistent
she
was
drawing
his
face
down
to
hers
i
wonder
she
murmured
whether
you
remember
book
ii
chapter
i
rather
a
ghastly
part
mademoiselle
rosine
raised
her
glass
her
big
black
eyes
flashed
unutterable
things
across
the
pink
roses
i
think
she
said
that
we
drink
the
good
health
of
our
host
meester
macheson
meester
victor
is
it
not
bravo
declared
a
youth
her
neighbour
at
the
round
supper
table
by
jove
if
we
were
at
the
instead
of
the
we
give
him
musical
honours
i
drink
macheson
declared
to
all
of
us
who
know
how
to
live
jules
another
magnum
and
look
sharp
certainly
sir
the
man
answered
there
flashed
a
quick
look
of
intelligence
between
the
waiter
and
a
maître
who
was
lingering
near
the
latter
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
it
was
a
noisy
party
and
none
too
reputable
but
a
magnum
of
champagne
was
an
order
they
were
likely
to
make
more
noise
still
if
they
did
get
it
so
the
wine
was
brought
and
more
toasts
were
drunk
mademoiselle
rosine
eyes
flashed
softer
things
than
ever
across
the
table
but
she
had
the
disadvantage
of
distance
ella
merriam
the
latest
american
importation
held
the
place
of
honour
next
macheson
and
she
was
now
endeavouring
to
possess
herself
of
his
hand
under
the
table
i
say
macheson
how
is
it
none
of
us
ever
ran
up
against
you
before
young
davenant
demanded
leaning
back
in
his
chair
never
set
eyes
on
you
myself
from
the
day
you
left
magdalen
till
i
ran
up
against
you
at
the
alhambra
the
other
evening
awfully
studious
chap
macheson
was
at
college
he
added
to
the
american
girl
thought
us
chaps
no
end
of
rotters
because
we
used
to
go
the
pace
a
bit
that
so
is
it
macheson
macheson
nodded
it
is
only
the
young
who
are
really
wise
he
declared
coolly
as
we
grow
older
we
make
fools
of
ourselves
inevitably
either
fools
or
beasts
according
to
our
proclivities
then
we
begin
to
enjoy
ourselves
the
girl
by
his
side
laughed
i
guess
you
do
mean
that
she
said
it
sounds
smart
but
it
real
horrid
how
old
are
you
mr
macheson
older
than
i
look
and
younger
than
i
feel
he
answered
gazing
into
his
empty
glass
have
you
found
what
you
call
your
proclivities
she
asked
i
am
searching
for
them
macheson
answered
the
trouble
is
one
does
know
whether
to
dig
or
to
climb
why
should
one
search
at
all
the
other
man
asked
drawing
out
a
gold
cigarette
case
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
carefully
selecting
a
cigarette
life
comes
easiest
to
those
who
go
blindfold
i
got
a
brother
private
secretary
to
a
member
of
parliament
he
got
views
about
things
and
he
makes
an
awful
fag
of
life
what
the
good
of
it
he
be
an
old
man
before
he
made
up
his
mind
which
way
he
wants
to
go
this
sort
of
thing
good
enough
for
me
the
magnum
had
arrived
and
macheson
lifted
a
foaming
glass
davenant
he
declared
you
are
a
philosopher
we
will
drink
to
life
as
it
comes
to
life
as
it
comes
they
none
of
them
noticed
the
little
break
in
his
voice
a
party
of
newcomers
claimed
their
attention
macheson
too
had
seen
them
he
had
seen
her
like
a
ghost
at
the
feast
he
sat
quite
motionless
his
glass
half
raised
in
the
air
the
colour
gone
from
his
cheeks
his
eyes
set
in
a
hard
fast
stare
wilhelmina
in
a
plain
black
velvet
gown
with
a
rope
of
pearls
about
her
neck
her
dark
hair
simply
arranged
about
her
pallid
distinguished
face
was
passing
down
the
room
followed
closely
by
the
earl
of
westerdean
deyes
and
lady
peggy
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
stop
a
light
sprang
into
her
eyes
and
a
delicate
spot
of
colour
burned
in
her
cheeks
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
his
companions
she
realized
his
surroundings
the
colour
went
the
momentary
hesitation
was
gone
she
passed
on
without
recognition
lady
peggy
after
a
curious
glance
did
the
same
she
whispered
and
laughed
in
deyes
ear
as
they
seated
themselves
at
an
adjacent
table
he
looked
round
behind
her
back
and
nodded
but
macheson
did
not
appear
to
see
him
a
momentary
constraint
fell
upon
the
little
party
the
american
young
lady
leaned
over
to
ask
davenant
who
the
newcomers
were
the
elder
man
he
said
is
the
earl
of
westerdean
and
the
pretty
fair
woman
lady
margaret
penshore
the
other
woman
is
a
miss
macheson
probably
knows
more
about
them
than
i
do
macheson
ignored
the
remark
he
whispered
something
in
his
ear
which
made
her
laugh
heartily
the
temporary
check
to
their
merriment
passed
away
macheson
was
soon
laughing
and
talking
as
much
as
any
of
them
supper
he
declared
would
be
the
most
delightful
meal
of
the
day
in
any
other
country
except
england
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
lights
will
be
out
but
it
is
barbarous
mademoiselle
rosine
declared
ah
monsieur
macheson
you
should
come
to
paris
there
it
is
that
one
may
enjoy
oneself
i
will
come
macheson
answered
whenever
you
will
take
me
she
clapped
her
hands
agreed
she
cried
i
have
finished
rehearsing
i
have
a
we
will
go
to
paris
all
four
of
us
i
on
davenant
declared
promptly
i
was
going
anyway
in
a
week
or
two
mademoiselle
rosine
clapped
her
hands
again
bravo
she
cried
and
you
mademoiselle
the
girl
hesitated
she
glanced
at
macheson
we
will
both
come
macheson
declared
miss
merriam
will
do
me
the
honour
to
go
as
my
guest
we
stay
at
the
vivandiére
davenant
said
i
a
pal
there
who
knows
the
ropes
right
up
to
date
what
about
the
we
shall
get
there
in
time
to
change
and
have
supper
at
noyeau
and
afterwards
rat
mademoiselle
rosine
cried
we
will
drink
a
glass
of
champagne
with
monsieur
françois
davenant
raised
his
glass
one
more
toast
then
before
the
bally
lights
go
out
he
exclaimed
to
paris
and
our
trip
some
one
touched
macheson
on
the
arm
he
turned
sharply
round
deyes
was
standing
there
tall
and
immaculately
attired
there
was
something
a
little
ghostly
in
the
pallor
of
his
worn
beardless
face
with
its
many
wrinkles
and
tired
eyes
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you
my
dear
fellow
he
said
we
are
having
our
coffee
outside
just
on
the
left
there
miss
wants
you
to
stop
for
a
moment
on
your
way
out
macheson
hesitated
perceptibly
a
dull
flush
of
colour
stained
his
cheek
fading
away
almost
immediately
he
set
his
teeth
hard
i
shall
be
very
happy
he
said
to
stop
for
a
second
deyes
bowed
and
turned
away
the
room
now
was
almost
in
darkness
and
the
people
were
streaming
out
into
the
foyer
macheson
paid
the
bill
and
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
others
seeing
him
approach
alone
wilhelmina
welcomed
him
with
a
smile
and
drew
her
skirts
on
one
side
to
make
room
for
him
to
sit
down
he
glanced
doubtfully
around
she
raised
her
eyebrows
your
friends
she
said
are
in
no
hurry
they
can
spare
you
for
a
moment
there
was
nothing
in
her
tone
to
indicate
any
surprise
at
finding
him
there
or
in
such
company
she
made
a
few
casual
remarks
in
her
somewhat
languid
fashion
and
recalled
him
to
the
recollection
of
lady
peggy
who
was
to
all
appearance
flirting
desperately
with
lord
westerdean
deyes
had
strolled
across
to
a
neighbouring
group
and
was
talking
to
a
actor
wilhelmina
leaned
towards
him
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
she
asked
quietly
that
you
left
me
a
little
abruptly
the
other
afternoon
his
eyes
blazed
into
hers
he
found
it
hard
to
emulate
the
quiet
restraint
of
her
tone
and
manner
it
was
a
trick
which
he
had
never
cultivated
never
inherited
this
playing
with
the
passions
in
kid
gloves
this
muzzling
and
harnessing
of
the
emotions
you
know
why
he
said
she
inclined
her
head
ever
so
slightly
to
where
his
late
companions
were
seated
and
this
she
asked
am
i
responsible
for
this
too
he
laughed
shortly
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
suggest
such
a
thing
he
declared
i
am
amusing
myself
a
little
why
not
are
you
she
asked
calmly
her
eyes
drew
his
he
almost
fancied
that
the
quiver
at
the
corners
of
her
lips
was
of
mirth
somehow
she
continued
i
am
not
sure
of
that
i
watched
you
now
and
then
in
there
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
playing
a
part
rather
a
ghastly
part
there
nothing
so
wearisome
you
know
as
pretending
to
enjoy
yourself
i
had
a
headache
he
said
frowning
she
bent
towards
him
is
it
better
now
she
whispered
smiling
he
threw
out
his
hands
with
a
quick
fierce
gesture
it
was
well
that
the
great
room
was
wrapped
in
the
mysterious
obscurity
of
and
that
every
one
was
occupied
with
the
business
of
farewells
he
sprang
to
his
feet
i
am
going
he
said
thickly
my
friends
are
expecting
me
she
shook
her
head
those
are
not
your
friends
she
said
you
know
very
well
that
they
never
could
be
you
can
go
and
wish
them
good
night
you
are
going
to
see
me
home
no
he
declared
if
you
please
she
begged
softly
he
crossed
the
room
unsteadily
and
made
his
excuses
with
the
best
grace
he
could
mademoiselle
rosine
made
a
wry
face
miss
ella
laid
her
fingers
upon
his
arm
and
looked
anxiously
up
at
him
say
you
wo
disappoint
us
she
said
it
all
fixed
up
about
paris
is
it
from
charing
cross
yes
he
answered
i
will
let
you
know
if
anything
turns
up
they
all
stood
around
him
davenant
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
look
here
old
chap
he
said
no
backing
out
we
promised
the
girls
and
we
must
disappoint
them
monsieur
macheson
would
not
be
so
cruel
mademoiselle
rosine
pleaded
he
has
promised
and
englishmen
never
break
their
workd
is
it
not
so
a
party
of
four
yes
that
is
very
well
but
alone
with
herbert
here
i
could
not
go
if
you
do
not
come
all
is
spoilt
is
it
not
so
my
friends
rather
davenant
declared
the
other
girl
fingers
tightened
upon
his
arm
do
go
away
now
she
whispered
come
round
to
my
flat
and
we
all
talk
it
over
i
will
sing
you
my
new
song
i
crazy
about
it
macheson
detached
himself
as
well
as
he
could
i
must
leave
you
now
he
declared
i
can
assure
you
that
i
mean
to
come
he
hurried
after
wilhelmina
who
was
saying
good
night
to
her
friends
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
being
whirled
westwards
in
her
brougham
chapter
ii
playing
with
fire
and
now
she
said
throwing
herself
into
an
and
taking
up
a
fan
we
can
talk
he
refused
the
chair
which
she
had
motioned
him
to
wheel
up
to
the
fire
he
stood
glowering
down
upon
her
pale
stern
yet
not
wholly
master
of
himself
against
the
sombre
black
of
her
dress
her
neck
and
bosom
shone
like
alabaster
she
played
with
her
pearls
and
looked
up
at
him
with
that
faint
maddening
curl
of
the
lips
which
he
so
loved
and
so
hated
so
you
wo
sit
down
i
wonder
why
a
man
always
feels
that
he
can
bully
a
woman
so
much
better
standing
up
there
is
no
question
of
bullying
you
he
answered
shortly
you
are
responsible
for
my
coming
here
what
is
it
that
you
want
with
me
suppose
she
murmured
looking
up
at
him
that
i
were
to
say
another
kiss
suppose
on
the
other
hand
he
answered
roughly
you
were
to
tell
me
the
truth
she
sighed
gently
you
jump
so
rapidly
at
conclusions
she
declared
are
you
sure
that
it
would
not
be
the
truth
if
it
were
he
began
fiercely
if
it
were
she
interrupted
well
i
would
rather
kiss
mademoiselle
rosine
or
whatever
her
name
is
he
said
i
would
sooner
go
out
into
the
street
and
kiss
the
first
woman
i
met
she
shook
her
head
what
an
impossible
person
you
are
she
murmured
of
course
i
believe
you
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
glanced
at
the
clock
are
you
going
to
keep
me
here
long
he
asked
roughly
i
am
going
to
paris
and
i
have
to
pack
my
clothes
to
paris
with
mademoiselle
rosine
yes
she
laughed
softly
oh
i
think
not
she
declared
that
sort
of
thing
would
amuse
you
a
bit
we
shall
see
he
muttered
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
go
she
repeated
why
not
he
demanded
because
i
beg
you
not
to
you
he
exclaimed
you
do
you
think
that
i
am
another
of
those
creatures
of
straw
and
putty
to
dance
to
your
whims
to
be
whistled
to
your
heel
to
be
fed
with
stray
kisses
and
an
occasional
kind
word
i
think
not
if
i
am
to
go
to
the
devil
i
will
go
my
own
way
you
inconsistent
creature
she
said
why
not
mine
i
take
my
soul
with
me
such
as
it
is
he
answered
i
not
make
away
with
it
while
my
feet
are
on
the
earth
do
you
know
that
you
are
really
a
very
extraordinary
person
she
said
what
i
am
you
are
responsible
for
he
answered
i
was
all
right
when
you
first
knew
me
i
may
have
been
ignorant
perhaps
but
at
any
rate
i
was
sincere
i
had
a
conscience
and
an
ideal
oh
i
suppose
you
found
me
very
amusing
a
missioner
who
thought
it
worth
while
to
give
a
part
of
his
life
to
help
his
fellows
climb
a
few
steps
higher
up
what
devil
was
it
that
sent
you
stealing
down
the
lane
that
night
from
your
house
i
wonder
she
nodded
slowly
i
sorry
you
can
speak
of
it
like
that
she
said
to
me
it
was
the
most
delightful
piece
of
sentiment
almost
like
a
poem
a
poem
it
was
the
devil
own
poetry
you
breathed
into
me
what
a
poor
mad
fool
i
became
you
saw
how
easily
i
gave
my
work
up
how
i
sulked
up
to
london
fighting
with
it
all
the
time
with
this
madness
this
dear
me
she
said
what
an
adam
you
are
my
dear
victor
it
you
are
very
very
young
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
manufacture
a
huge
tragedy
out
of
a
woman
kiss
what
else
is
it
but
a
tragedy
he
demanded
the
kiss
that
is
a
lie
or
worse
you
brought
me
here
you
let
me
hold
you
in
my
arms
you
filled
my
brain
with
mad
thoughts
you
drove
everything
good
and
worth
having
out
of
life
you
filled
it
with
what
yourself
and
then
you
pat
me
on
the
cheek
and
tell
me
to
come
and
be
kissed
some
other
day
when
you
feel
in
the
humour
a
wet
afternoon
perhaps
or
when
you
are
feeling
bored
and
want
to
hunt
up
a
few
new
emotions
it
may
be
the
way
with
you
and
your
kind
i
call
it
hellish
well
she
said
tell
me
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
want
to
be
laughed
at
as
you
did
before
he
answered
fiercely
never
mind
it
was
the
truth
you
have
lain
in
my
arms
you
came
willingly
your
lips
have
been
mine
you
belong
to
me
to
be
quite
explicit
she
murmured
you
think
i
ought
to
marry
you
yes
he
declared
firmly
a
kiss
is
a
promise
you
seem
to
want
to
live
as
a
to
make
playthings
of
your
emotions
and
mine
i
wanted
to
build
up
my
life
firmly
to
make
it
a
stable
and
a
useful
thing
you
came
and
wrecked
it
and
you
wo
even
help
me
to
rebuild
let
us
understand
one
another
thoroughly
she
said
your
complaint
is
then
that
i
will
not
marry
you
the
word
the
surprising
amazing
word
left
her
lips
again
so
calmly
that
macheson
was
staggered
a
little
confused
by
its
marvellous
significance
he
was
thrown
off
his
balance
and
she
smiled
as
a
wrestler
who
has
tripped
his
adversary
henceforth
she
expected
to
find
him
easier
to
deal
with
you
know
that
it
is
not
that
altogether
he
faltered
what
is
it
that
you
want
then
she
asked
calmly
there
are
not
many
men
in
the
world
who
have
kissed
even
my
hand
there
are
fewer
still
whom
i
have
kissed
i
thought
that
i
had
been
rather
kind
to
you
kind
he
threw
out
his
arms
with
a
despairing
gesture
you
call
it
kindness
the
drop
of
magic
you
pour
into
a
man
veins
the
touch
of
your
body
the
breath
of
your
lips
vouchsafed
for
a
second
the
elixir
of
a
new
life
what
is
it
to
you
a
caprice
a
little
dabbling
in
the
emotions
a
device
to
make
a
few
minutes
of
the
long
days
pass
more
smoothly
perhaps
it
the
way
in
your
world
this
you
cheat
yourself
of
a
happiness
by
making
physiological
experiments
frittering
away
the
great
chance
out
of
sheer
curiosity
or
something
worse
and
we
who
do
understand
the
game
we
are
the
victims
really
she
said
pleasantly
you
are
very
eloquent
and
you
he
said
are
her
hand
flashed
out
almost
to
his
lips
long
shapely
fingers
ablaze
with
the
dull
fire
of
emeralds
stop
she
commanded
you
are
not
quite
yourself
this
evening
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
say
something
which
you
will
regret
now
listen
you
have
made
a
most
eloquent
attack
upon
me
but
you
must
admit
that
it
is
a
perfect
tangle
of
generalities
wo
you
condescend
to
look
me
in
the
face
leave
off
vague
complaints
and
tell
me
precisely
why
you
have
placed
me
in
the
dock
and
yourself
upon
the
bench
in
plain
words
mind
no
evasions
i
want
the
truth
you
shall
have
it
he
answered
grimly
listen
then
i
began
at
thorpe
you
were
at
once
rude
and
kind
to
me
i
was
a
simple
ass
of
course
and
you
were
a
mistress
in
all
the
arts
which
go
to
a
undoing
it
was
an
equal
fight
i
struggled
a
little
but
i
thanked
god
that
i
had
an
excuse
to
give
up
my
work
i
came
to
london
but
the
poison
was
working
every
morning
before
you
were
up
and
every
night
after
dark
i
walked
round
your
square
and
the
days
i
saw
you
were
the
days
that
counted
dear
me
how
interesting
she
interrupted
softly
and
to
think
that
i
never
knew
i
never
meant
you
to
know
he
declared
a
fool
i
was
from
the
first
but
never
fool
enough
to
misunderstand
when
i
brought
letty
foulton
to
you
i
brought
her
against
my
will
it
was
for
the
child
sake
and
you
were
angry
and
then
i
saw
you
again
and
you
were
kind
she
smiled
at
him
i
glad
you
admit
that
she
said
gently
i
thought
that
i
was
very
kind
indeed
and
you
repaid
me
how
kind
he
cried
fiercely
yes
you
were
kind
you
were
mine
for
the
moment
you
lay
in
my
arms
you
gave
me
your
lips
it
was
an
impression
it
amused
you
to
see
any
human
being
so
much
in
earnest
then
the
mood
passed
your
dole
of
charity
had
been
given
i
must
sit
apart
and
you
must
smooth
your
hair
what
did
it
all
amount
to
an
episode
a
trifling
debauch
in
sentiment
and
for
me
god
knows
to
return
once
more
she
said
patiently
to
your
complaint
is
it
that
i
will
not
marry
you
i
did
not
ask
that
at
first
he
answered
it
is
a
good
deal
i
know
then
do
you
want
to
come
and
kiss
me
every
day
she
asked
because
i
do
think
that
that
would
suit
me
either
i
can
believe
it
he
said
i
am
inclined
to
think
she
said
that
you
are
a
very
grasping
and
unreasonable
person
i
have
permitted
you
privileges
which
more
men
than
my
modesty
permits
me
to
tell
you
of
have
begged
for
in
vain
you
have
accepted
them
i
promised
nothing
beyond
nor
have
you
asked
for
it
yet
because
i
was
obliged
to
talk
reasonably
to
you
you
flung
yourself
out
of
my
house
and
i
am
left
to
rescue
you
at
the
expense
of
my
pride
perhaps
also
of
my
reputation
from
associations
which
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
to
talk
reasonably
to
me
he
repeated
slowly
do
you
remember
what
you
said
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
naturally
and
what
i
said
was
true
enough
i
was
to
be
content
with
scraps
to
go
away
and
forget
you
until
chance
or
a
whim
of
yours
should
bring
us
together
again
did
you
want
so
much
more
she
asked
with
a
swift
maddening
glance
at
him
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
couch
oh
i
love
you
he
said
forgive
me
if
i
am
unreasonable
or
foolish
i
ca
help
it
you
came
so
unexpectedly
so
wonderfully
and
you
see
i
lost
my
head
as
well
as
my
heart
i
have
so
little
to
offer
you
and
i
want
so
much
her
hands
rested
for
a
moment
caressingly
upon
his
shoulders
a
whole
world
of
wonderful
things
was
shining
out
of
her
eyes
it
was
only
her
lips
that
were
cruel
my
dear
boy
she
said
you
want
what
i
may
not
give
i
am
very
very
sorry
i
think
there
must
have
been
some
sorcery
in
the
air
that
night
the
spell
of
the
roses
must
have
crept
into
my
blood
i
am
sorry
for
what
i
did
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
did
not
leave
you
alone
he
rose
heavily
to
his
feet
his
face
was
grey
with
suffering
i
ought
to
have
known
he
said
i
think
that
i
did
know
all
the
same
she
continued
laying
her
hand
upon
his
arm
i
think
that
you
are
a
rank
extremist
he
shook
his
head
i
do
understand
he
said
shall
i
teach
you
she
whispered
he
flung
her
hand
away
no
he
said
savagely
she
sighed
i
am
afraid
you
had
better
go
away
she
said
as
he
closed
the
door
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
sob
but
it
might
have
been
only
fancy
chapter
iii
monsieur
young
davenant
declared
with
something
which
was
suspiciously
like
a
yawn
i
really
think
that

chuck
it
just
a
little
earlier
shall
we
say
that
we
leave
here
at
two
and
get
back
to
the
hotel
mademoiselle
rosine
pouted
but
said
nothing
the
young
lady
from
america
tried
to
take
macheson
hand
yes
she
murmured
do
let
i
dead
tired
she
whispered
something
in
macheson
ear
which
he
affected
not
to
hear
he
leaned
back
in
his
cushioned
seat
and
laughed
what
go
home
without
seeing
françois
he
exclaimed
he
keeping
the
corner
table
for
us
and
we
all
going
to

little
russian
girl

violin
under
his
arm

parfaitement
monsieur
the
man
bowed
himself
away
with
a
piece
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
the
orchestra
began
a
gay
macheson
starting
up
passed
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
a
little
parisienne
just
arriving
she
threw
her
gold
satchel
on
to
a
table
and
they
danced
round
the
room
davenant
watched
them
with
unwilling
admiration
well
macheson
a
fair
knockout
he
declared
i
hanged
if
he
can
keep
still
for
five
minutes
and
when
i
knew
him
at
oxford
he
was
one
of
the
most
studious
chaps
in
the
college
gad

dancing
with
another
girl
now
look

drinking
champagne
out
of
her
glass
should
stand

ella
ella
was
watching

her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
there
was
more
colour
than
usual
in
her
cheeks
it
nothing
to
me
what
macheson
does
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
do
understand
him
a
bit
i
think
he
mad
mademoiselle
rosine
leaned
across
and
whispered
in
her
ear
ella
shook
her
head

is
any
girl

him
she
said
he

goes
laughing
you

with
them
too
he
has
finished
with
them
now
he
comes
back
to
us
guess
i
not
sure

want
him
nevertheless
she
moved
her
skirts
and
made
room
for
him
by
her
side
macheson
came
up
out
of
breath
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
wine
what
a
time
they
are
serving
supper
he
exclaimed
davenant

mademoiselle
rosine
he
raised
his
glass
and
bowed
mademoiselle
rosine
laughed
at
him
out
of
her
big
black
eyes
he
was
rather
a
fascinating
figure
this
tall
young
englishman
who
spoke
french
so
perfectly
and
danced
so
well
i
would
make
you
come
and
sit
by
me
monsieur
macheson
she
declared
but
ella
would
be
jealous
what
about
me
davenant
exclaimed
oh
là
là
she
answered
pinching
his
arm
i
sure
i
do
mind
ella
declared
i
guess

free
to
talk
to
whom
we
please
macheson
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
opposite
to
them
i
choose
to
look
at
you
both
he
said
banging
the
table
with
his
knife
garçon
we
did
not

to
eat
your
flowers
or
your
immaculate
tablecloth
we
ordered
supper
half
an
hour
ago
good
it
arrives
no
one
but
macheson
seemed
to
have
much
appetite
he
ate
and
he
drank
and
he
talked
almost
alone
he
ordered
another
bottle
of
wine
and
the
tongues
of
the
others
became
a
little
looser
the
music
was
going
now
all
the
time
and
many
couples
were
dancing
the
girl
dancing
with
an
older
woman
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
as
she
passed
and
laughed
into
his
face
there
is
no
one
she
murmured
who
dances
like
monsieur
he
sprang
up
from
his
seat
and
whirled
her
round
the
room
she
leaned
against
his
arm
and
whispered
in
his
ear
ella
watched
her
with
darkening
face
it
is
little
flossie
from
the
mademoiselle
rosine
remarked
you
must
have
a
care
ella
she
has
followed
monsieur
macheson
everywhere
with
her
eyes
he
returned
to
his
place
and
continued
his
supper
hang
it
all
you
people
are
dull
he
exclaimed
drink
some
more
wine
davenant
and
look
after
mademoiselle
miss
ella
he
filled
her
glass
and
she
leaned
over
the
table
every
one
else
seems
to
make
love
to
you
she
whispered
i
guess
have
to
begin
if
you
call
me
miss
ella
again
i
shall
box
your
ears
ella
then
what
you
will
he
exclaimed
remember
all
of
you
that
we
are
here
to
have
a
good
time
not

mope
davenant
if
you

between
the
girls

they
both
cried
mademoiselle
rosine
held
out
her
arms
but
macheson
kept
his
seat
let
go
up
to
the
if
we
going
ella
exclaimed
dull
here
and
i
tired
of
seeing
that
girl
make
eyes
at
you
macheson
laughed
and
drained
his
glass
rat
mort
he
cried
good
they
paid
the
bill
and
all
trooped
out
the
girl
caught
at
macheson
hand
as
he
passed
rat
mort
she
whispered
she
threw
a
meaning
glance
at
ella
monsieur
is
well
guarded
she
said
softly
malheureusement
he
answered
smiling
davenant
drew
him
on
one
side
as
the
girls
went
for
their
cloaks
i
say
old
chap
he
began
are
you
trying
ella
a
bit
high
not
a
girl
you
know
but
i
afraid
there
be
a
row
soon
macheson
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
a
row
he
answered
i
do
see
why
you
a
bit
catholic
in
your
attentions
you
know
davenant
remarked
why
not
macheson
answered
ella
is
nothing
to
me
no
more
are
the
rest
of
them
i
amuse
myself
that
all
davenant
looked
as
he
felt
puzzled
well
he
said
i
not
sure
that
ella
sees
it
in
that
light
why
should
she
macheson
demanded
well
hang
it
all
you
brought
her
over
did
you
davenant
reminded
him
she
came
over
as
my
guest
macheson
answered
that
is
to
say
i
pay
for
her
whenever
she
chooses
to
come
out
with
us
and
i
pay
or
shall
pay
her
hotel
bill
beyond
that
i
imagine
that
we
are
both
of
us
free
to
amuse
ourselves
as
we
please
i
do
believe
ella
looks
at
it
in
that
light
davenant
said
hesitatingly
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
er
of
course
not
macheson
interrupted
has
she
oh
shut
up
macheson
exclaimed
here
they
come
ella
passed
her
arm
through
his
mademoiselle
rosine
had
told
her
while
she
stood
on
tiptoe
and
dabbed
at
her
cheeks
with
a
that
she
was
too
cold
the
messieurs
anglais
were
often
so
difficult
they
needed
encouragement
so
very
much
encouragement
then
there
were
more
confidences
and
madame
rosine
was
very
much
astonished
what
sort
of
a
man
was
this
monsieur
macheson
yet
so
gallant
so
gay
she
promised
herself
that
she
would
watch
him
we
will
drive
up
together
you
and
i
ella
whispered
in
his
ear
but
macheson
only
laughed
i
hired
a
motor
car
for
the
night
he
said
in
you
get
i
going
to
sit
in
front
with
the
chauffeur
and
sing
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
ella
declared
almost
sharply
you
will
come
inside
with
us
anywhere
anyhow
he
answered
to
the
little
hell
at
the
top
of
the
hill
jean
and
drive
fast
he
directed
jove
it
two
hurry
up
davenant
we
shall
have
no
time
there
at
all
there
was
barely
room
for
four
mademoiselle
rosine
perched
herself
daintily
on
davenant
knee
ella
tried
to
draw
macheson
into
her
arms
but
he
sank
on
to
the
floor
and
sat
with
his
hands
round
his
knees
singing
a
french
song
of
the
moment
they
shouted
to
him
to
leave
off
but
he
only
sang
the
louder
then
in
a
block
he
sprang
from
the
car
seized
the
whole
stock
of
a
pavement
and
paying
her
magnificently
emptied
them
through
the
window
of
the
car
into
the
girls
laps
and
turning
round
as
suddenly
disappeared
he
mad
quite
mad
ella
declared
with
a
sigh
i
do
believe
we
shall
see
him
again
nevertheless
he
was
on
the
pavement
outside
the
awaiting
them
chaffing
the
commissionaire
he
threw
open
the
door
and
welcomed
them
they
are
turning
people
away
here
he
declared
heaps
of
fun
going
on
all
the
artistes
from
the
circus
are
here
and
a
party
of
spaniards
françois
has
kept
our
table
come
along
ella
hung
on
to
him
as
they
climbed
the
narrow
shabby
staircase
say
she
pleaded
in
his
ear
do
you
want
to
be
a
little
nicer
to
me
command
me
he
answered
i
am
in
a
most
amenable
temper
sit
with
me
instead
of
wandering
round
so
you
do
want
to
talk
to
every
pretty
girl
do
you
he
laughed
why
not
are
we
all
on
the
same
quest
it
is
the
of
pleasure
they
reached
the
bend
of
the
stairs
from
above
they
could
hear
the
music
the
rattle
of
plates
the
hum
of
voices
she
leaned
towards
him
kiss
me
please
she
whispered
he
stooped
down
and
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
she
drew
it
slowly
away
and
looked
at
him
curiously
your
lips
are
cold
she
said
he
laughed
the
night
is
young
he
answered
see
there
is
françois
they
passed
on
ella
was
a
little
more
content
it
was
the
most
promising
thing
he
had
said
to
her
chapter
iv
at
the
dead
rat
monsieur
françois
piloted
the
little
party
himself
to
the
corner
table
which
he
had
reserved
for
them
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
this
tall
young
englishman
whose
french
save
for
a
trifle
of
accent
was
as
perfect
as
his
own
who
spent
money
with
both
hands
who
was
gay
as
the
gayest
and
yet
who
had
the
air
of
being
little
more
than
a
at
the
merriment
which
he
did
so
much
to
promote
we
are
full
monsieur
he
said
there
will
be
a
great
crowd
yet
you
see
your
table
waits
mademoiselle
bolero
herself
begged
for
it
but
i
said
always
no
no
it
is
for
monsieur
and
his
friends
you
are
a
prince
macheson
exclaimed
as
they
filed
into
their
places
we
are
going
to
prove
to
ourselves
that
we
are
indeed
in
paris
sommelier
the
same
wine
in
magnums
my
friend
is
sleepy
we
must
wake
him
up
ah
mademoiselle
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
little
danseuse
you
must
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
us
and
afterwards
the
maxixe
waiter
a
glass
a
chair
for
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
came
pirouetting
up
to
them
monsieur
was
very
kind
she
would
take
a
glass
of
champagne
and
afterwards
yes
the
maxixe
if
they
desired
it
they
sat
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
facing
the
little
space
along
which
the
visitors
to
the
café
came
and
went
and
where
under
difficulties
one
danced
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
came
bowing
and
smiling
towards
them
playing
an
american
waltz
and
macheson
with
a
laugh
sprang
up
and
guided
mademoiselle
through
the
throng
of
people
and
hurrying
waiters
monsieur
comes
often
to
paris
she
asked
as
they
whirled
around
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
macheson
answered
we
are
here
on
a
quest
we
want
to
understand
what
pleasure
means
mademoiselle
sighed
ever
so
slightly
under
the
powder
with
which
her
pretty
face
was
disfigured
one
is
gay
here
always
she
said
somewhat
doubtfully
but
it
is
the
people
who
come
seldom
who
enjoy
themselves
the
most
macheson
laughed
as
he
led
her
back
to
their
table
you
are
right
he
declared
pleasure
is
a
subtle
thing
it
does
not
do
to
analyse
macheson
filled
her
glass
sit
down
he
said
and
tell
us
about
the
people
it
is
early
yet
i
suppose
she
nodded
yes
she
answered
there
are
many
who
come
every
night
who
have
not
yet
arrived
ella
leaned
forward
to
ask
a
question
and
mademoiselle
nodded
yes
that
was
bolero
at
the
small
table
opposite
she
sat
with
three
men
one
of
whom
was
busy
sketching
on
the
back
of
the
menu
card
bolero
with
her
wonderful
string
of
pearls
smileless
stolid
with
the
boredom
in
her
face
of
the
woman
who
sees
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
monsieur
with
the
ruffled
hair
and
black
eyes
yes
a
russian
certainly
mademoiselle
with
a
smile
which
belied
her
words
was
not
sure
of
his
name
but
françois
spoke
always
of
his
highness
the
gentleman
with
the
face
who
read
a
newspaper
and
supped
alone
mademoiselle
looked
around
she
hesitated
after
all
monsieur
and
his
friends
were
only
casual
visitors
it
was
not
for
them
to
repeat
it
but
the
gentleman
was
a
detective
one
of
the
most
famous
he
had
watched
for
some
one
for
many
nights
in
the
end
it
would
happen
ah
some
one
was
asking
for
a
mademoiselle
finished
her
wine
hastily
and
sprang
up
she
will
return
but
certainly
if
monsieur
pleases
the
band
struck
up
something
american
mademoiselle
danced
up
and
down
the
little
space
between
the
tables
ella
laid
her
hand
upon
shoulder
why
do
you
want
to
talk
to
every
one
she
whispered
i
think
you
forget
sometimes
that
you
are
not
alone
macheson
laughed
impatiently
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
you
too
forget
that
we
are
on
a
quest
we
are
here
to
understand
what
pleasure
means
how
to
win
it
we
must
talk
to
every
one
do
everything
everybody
else
does
it
no
good
looking
on
all
the
time
but
you
never
talk
to
me
at
all
she
objected
rubbish
he
answered
lightly

am

hungry

must
order
supper
davenant
whose
hair
mademoiselle
rosine
had
been
ruffling
whose
tie
was
no
longer
immaculate
and
who
was
beginning
to
realize
that
he
had
drunk
a
good
deal
of
wine
leaned
forward
and
regarded
macheson
with
admiration
old
man
he
declared
you
great
order
what
you
like
we
will
eat
it
somehow
wo
we
rosine
she
laughed
assent
for
me
she
begged
some
caviare
and
afterwards
an
omelette
consommé
and
dry
biscuits
and
some
fruit
ella
suggested
macheson
gave
the
order
and
filled
their
glasses
it
was
two
and
people
were
beginning
to
stream
in
unattached
ladies
strolled
down
the
room
looking
for
a
friend
or
to
make
one
their
more
fortunate
sisters
of
the
haute
were
beginning
to
arrive
with
their
escorts
from
the
restaurants
and
cafés
greetings
were
shouted
up
and
down
the
room
suddenly
ella
face
clouded
over
again
it
was
the
girl
in
blue
with
whom
macheson
had
danced
at
lesueur
who
had
just
entered
with
a
party
of
friends
women
in
lace
coats
and
wonderful
opera
cloaks
the
men
all
the
shiniest
silk
hats
in
europe
white
gloves
supercilious
and
immaculate
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
her
as
with
her
blue
skirts
daringly
lifted
she
danced
down
the
room
to
the
table
which
was
hastily
being
prepared
for
them
her
piquant
face
was
wreathed
with
smiles
she
shouted
greetings
everywhere
and
when
she
saw
macheson
she
threw
him
kisses
with
both
hands
which
he
stood
up
and
gallantly
returned
she
was
the
centre
of
attraction
until
mademoiselle
anna
from
the
circus
arrived
and
to
reach
her
place
leaped
lightly
over
an
intervening
table
with
a
wonderful
display
of
red
silk
stocking
and
filmy
lingerie
the
place
became
gayer
and
noisier
every
moment
greetings
were
shouted
from
table
to
table
the
spirit
of
bohemianism
seemed
to
flash
about
the
place
like
quicksilver
people
who
were
complete
strangers
drank
one
another
health
across
the
room
the
waiters
were
rushing
frantically
about
the
popping
of
corks
was
almost
incessant
a
blue
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
hung
about
the
room
macheson
leaning
back
in
his
place
watched
with
eyes
that
missed
little
he
saw
the
little
man
whose
identity
mademoiselle
had
disclosed
calmly
fold
up
his
paper
light
a
cigarette
and
stroll
across
the
room
to
a
table
nearly
opposite
a
man
was
sitting
there
with
a
couple
of
women
a
big
man
with
a
flushed
face
and
tumbled
hair
the
waiter
was
opening
a
magnum
of
champagne
everything
seemed
to
promise
a
cheerful
time
for
the
trio
then
a
word
was
whispered
in
his
ear
the
newcomer
bowed
apologetically
to
the
ladies
and
accepted
a
glass
of
wine
but
a
moment
later
the
two
men
left
the
place
together
and
neither
returned
what
are
you
staring
at
ella
demanded
curiously
macheson
looked
away
from
the
door
and
smiled
quietly
i
was
wondering
he
answered
what
it
was
like
outside
would
you
like
to
go
she
whispered
eagerly
in
his
ear
i
ready
the
others
could
come
on
afterwards
what
without
supper
he
exclaimed
my
dear
girl
i
starving
besides
i
did
mean
that
altogether
it
rather
hard
to
know
what
you
do
mean
she
remarked
with
a
sigh
say
i
do
understand
you
a
little
bit
how
should
you
he
answered
when
i
in
the
same
fix
myself
i
wish
you
were
like
other
boys
she
remarked
you
so
difficult
he
looked
at
her
without
the
mask
for
a
moment
and
she
drew
back
wondering
for
his
eyes
were
very
weary
and
they
spoke
to
her
of
things
which
she
did
not
understand
do
try
he
said
it
would
be
any
good
mademoiselle
sank
into
her
chair
opposite
to
them
breathless
and
hot
she
accepted
a
glass
of
wine
and
begged
for
a
cigarette
she
whispered
in
macheson
ear
that
the
big
man
was
a
forger
an
affair
of
the
year
before
last
he
was
safe
away
from
paris
but
the
price
of
his
liberty
was
more
than
he
could
pay
the
man
there
to
the
left
with
the
lady
in
pink
no
not
the
vicomte
the
one
beyond
he
was
tried
for
murder
a
month
ago
there
was
a
witness
missing
the
case
fell
through
but
mademoiselle
shook
her
shoulders
significantly
the
lady
with
fair
hair
and
dark
eyes
macheson
asked
was
she
english
but
certainly
mademoiselle
assured
him
she
was
the
divorced
wife
of
an
english
nobleman
she
is
alone
mademoiselle
added
but
it
is
not
often
ah
monsieur
mademoiselle
shook
her
finger
across
the
table
macheson
too
curious
glance
had
provoked
a
smile
of
invitation
from
the
lady
i
really
think
you
might
remember
that
i
am
here
ella
remarked
it
is
very
interesting
to
hear
you
talk
french
but
i
get
tired
of
it
mademoiselle
took
the
hint
and
flitted
away
supper
arrived
and
created
a
diversion
nevertheless
macheson
alone
of
the
little
party
seemed
to
have
absorbed
successfully
the
spirit
of
the
place
he
was
almost
recklessly
gay
he
drank
toasts
right
and
left
he
was
the
centre
from
which
the
hilarity
of
the
room
seemed
to
radiate
davenant
was
half
muddled
with
wine
and
sleepy
he
sat
with
his
arm
about
rosine
who
looked
more
often
towards
macheson
ella
who
had
refused
to
eat
anything
was
looking
flushed
and
angry
she
had
tried
to
link
her
arm
in
her
companion
but
he
had
gently
disengaged
it
she
kept
whispering
in
his
ear
and
sat
with
her
eyes
glued
upon
mademoiselle
flossie
whose
glances
and
smiles
were
all
for
macheson
and
soon
after
the
end
came
the
band
began
a
waltz
it
was
apparently
mademoiselle
herself
who
had
commanded
it
with
the
first
bars
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
came
floating
down
the
room
her
arms
stretched
out
towards
macheson
she
leaned
over
the
table
her
body
swaying
towards
him
her
gesture
of
invitation
piquant
bewitching
macheson
springing
at
once
to
his
feet
rested
his
hand
for
a
moment
upon
the
table
which
hemmed
him
in
and
vaulted
lightly
into
the
room
a
chorus
of
laughter
and
bravoes
greeted
his
feat
but
he
is
un
homme
galant
this
englishman
a
frenchwoman
cried
out
delighted
every
one
was
watching
the
couple
but
ella
rose
to
her
feet
and
called
a
waiter
to
move
the
table
i
am
going
she
said
angrily
i
have
had
enough
of
this
you
people
can
come
when
you
like
they
tried
to
stop
her
but
it
was
useless
she
swept
down
the
room
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
macheson
and
his
companion
a
spot
of
angry
colour
burning
in
her
cheeks
davenant
and
mademoiselle
rosine
stood
up
preparing
to
follow
her
the
former
shouted
to
macheson
who
brought
his
partner
up
to
their
table
and
poured
her
out
a
glass
of
champagne
ella
gone
davenant
exclaimed
you
catch
it
macheson
smiled
i
sorry
he
said
quietly
are
you
off
too
as
soon
as
the
johnny
brings
the
bill
davenant
answered
i
settle
up
macheson
declared
take
the
automobile
i
follow
you
in
a
few
minutes
mademoiselle
flossie
called
back
to
her
own
table
hurried
off
with
a
parting
squeeze
of
macheson
hand
he
sat
down
alone
for
a
moment
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
darkey
with
a
doll
hat
upon
his
head
was
singing
a
coon
song
chapter
v
the
awakening
alone
for
the
first
moment
of
the
evening
it
seemed
to
macheson
that
a
sudden
wave
of
confounding
thoughts
surged
into
his
brain
at
war
from
the
first
with
all
that
was
sensuous
and
brilliant
in
this
new
and
swiftly
developed
phase
of
his
personality
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
when
again
he
opened
them
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
a
miracle
had
taken
place
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
changed
he
looked
around
incredulous
amazed
the
men
especially
were
different
such
good
fellows
as
they
had
seemed
a
few
moments
ago
from
his
altered
point
of
view
macheson
regarded
them
now
in
scornful
curiosity
their
ties
were
awry
their
hair
was
ruffled
their
faces
were
paled
or
flushed
the
laughter
of
women
rang
still
through
the
place
but
the
music
had
gone
from
their
mirth
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
suddenly
through
the
smiles
that
wreathed
their
lips
saw
underneath
the
barren
mockery
of
it
all
this
hideous
travesty
of
life
in
its
gentler
moods
had
but
one
end
the
cold
relentless
path
to
oblivion
louder
and
louder
the
laughter
rang
until
macheson
felt
that
he
must
close
his
ears
the
devil
was
using
his
whip
indeed
mademoiselle
la
danseuse
seeing
him
alone
paused
at
his
table
on
her
way
through
the
room
monsieur
is
she
remarked
because
his
friends
have
departed
macheson
shook
his
head
i
am
off
too
in
a
few
minutes
he
answered
a
waiter
with
immovable
face
slipped
a
note
into
his
hand
under
cover
of
presenting
the
bill
macheson
read
it
and
glanced
across
the
room
mademoiselle
flossie
was
watching
him
with
uplifted
eyebrows
and
expectant
smile
macheson
shook
his
head
slightly
but
unmistakably
the
young
lady
in
blue
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
pouted
mademoiselle
la
danseuse
was
watching
him
curiously
i
wonder
she
said
softly
why
monsieur
comes
here
in
search
of
pleasure
macheson
answered
grimly
she
looked
at
him
fixedly
and
macheson
momentarily
interested
returned
her
gaze
then
he
saw
that
underneath
the
false
smile
for
a
moment
laid
aside
there
was
something
human
in
her
face
monsieur
makes
a
brave
show
but
he
does
not
succeed
she
remarked
and
you
he
asked
why
do
you
come
here
it
pays
very
well
she
answered
quietly
and
left
him
macheson
settled
his
bill
and
called
for
the
vestiaire
in
the
further
corner
of
the
room
two
women
were
quarrelling
the
languid
senses
of
those
who
still
lingered
in
the
place
were
stirred
the
place
was
electrified
instantly
with
a
new
excitement
a
fight
perhaps
every
one
crowded
around
unnoticed
macheson
walked
out
down
the
narrow
stairs
he
groped
his
way
with
the
music
of
the
orchestra
the
fierce
hysterical
cries
of
the
women
the
mock
cheering
of
those
who
crowded
round
in
his
ears
he
passed
out
into
the
dawn
the
stars
were
faint
in
the
sky
and
away
eastwards
little
fleecy
red
clouds
were
strewn
over
the
he
stood
on
the
pavement
and
drew
in
a
long
breath
the
morning
breeze
was
like
a
draught
of
cold
water
it
was
as
though
he
had
come
back
to
life
again
after
an
interlude
spent
in
some
other
world
overhead
he
could
still
hear
the
music
of
the
valse
amoureuse
the
swell
of
voices
he
shivered
with
the
cold
perhaps
or
the
memory
of
the
nightmare
the
commissionaire
hat
in
hand
summoned
a
coupé
and
macheson
took
his
place
in
the
small
open
carriage
down
the
cobbled
street
they
went
the
crazy
vehicle
swaying
upon
its
worn
rubber
tyres
past
other
night
resorts
with
their
blaze
of
lights
and
string
of
waiting
cabs
past
women
in
light
boots
in
strange
costumes
artificial
in
colour
and
shape
painted
uncanny
pilgrims
in
the
city
of
pleasure
past
the
great
churches
silent
and
stern
in
the
cold
morning
light
past
scavengers
into
the
heart
of
the
city
where
a
thin
stream
of
early
morning
toilers
went
on
their
relentless
way
once
more
he
entered
the
obscurity
of
his
dimly
lit
hotel
where
servants
were
sweeping
and
retired
to
his
room
into
which
he
let
himself
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
threw
up
the
blinds
and
opened
the
windows
to
be
alone
within
those
four
walls
was
a
blessed
thing
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
five
his
eyes
were
hot
but
he
had
no
desire
for
sleep
he
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
threw
himself
into
an
suddenly
he
looked
up
some
one
was
knocking
softly
at
his
door
he
walked
slowly
towards
it
and
paused
all
his
senses
were
still
pulsating
with
a
curious
sense
of
excitement
when
he
stood
still
he
could
almost
hear
his
heart
beat
from
outside
came
the
soft
rustling
of
a
woman
gown
he
knew
very
well
who
it
was
that
waited
there
he
stood
still
and
waited
again
there
came
the
knocking
to
him
almost
like
a
symbolical
thing
in
its
stealthy
muffled
insistence
he
felt
himself
battling
with
a
sudden
wave
of
emotions
struggling
with
a
passionate
unexpected
desire
to
answer
the
summons
he
took
a
quick
step
forwards
then
sanity
came
and
the
moment
seemed
far
away
a
part
of
the
nightmare
left
behind
he
waited
until
he
heard
the
quiet
reluctant
footsteps
pass
away
down
the
corridor
then
he
muttered
something
to
himself
which
sounded
like
a
prayer
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
the
recollection
of
that
moment
was
horrible
to
him
he
stared
at
the
door
with
fascinated
eyes
what
if
he
had
opened
it
he
still
had
no
desire
for
sleep
but
he
began
slowly
to
undress
his
clothes
his
tie
everything
he
had
been
wearing
seemed
to
him
to
reek
of
accumulated
perfumes
of
the
night
and
he
flung
them
from
him
with
feverish
disgust
there
was
a
small
opening
from
his
sleeping
chamber
and
with
a
desire
for
complete
cleanliness
which
was
not
wholly
physical
he
filled
the
bath
and
plunged
in
the
touch
of
the
cold
water
was
inspiring
and
he
stepped
out
again
into
a
new
world
much
of
the
horror
of
so
short
a
time
ago
had
gone
but
with
his
new
self
had
come
an
distaste
for
any
resumption
in
any
shape
or
form
of
his
associations
of
the
last
few
days
he
must
get
away
he
rummaged
through
his
things
and
found
a
timetable
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
dressed
his
clothes
were
packed
and
the
bill
was
paid
he
wrote
a
short
note
to
davenant
and
a
shorter
one
to
ella
ignoring
the
events
of
the
last
night
he
spoke
of
a
summons
home
he
enclosed
the
receipted
hotel
bill
and
something
with
which
he
begged
her
to
purchase
a
souvenir
of
her
visit
then
he
drank
some
coffee
and
with
a
somewhat
stealthy
air
made
his
way
to
the
lift
and
thence
to
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
already
a
small
victoria
was
laden
with
his
luggage
the
concierge
the
the
porters
were
all
tipped
with
a
prodigality
almost
reckless
shaven
and
with
a
sting
of
the
cold
water
still
upon
his
skin
in
homely
flannel
shirt
and
grey
tweed
travelling
clothes
he
felt
like
a
man
restored
to
sanity
and
health
as
his
cab
lumbered
over
the
long
cobbled
street
on
its
way
to
the
gare
du
nord
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
hours
and
yet
how
sweet
and
fresh
the
streets
seemed
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
the
shops
were
all
open
and
the
busy
housewives
were
hard
at
work
with
their
bargaining
the
toilers
of
the
city
thronged
the
pavements
everywhere
there
was
evidence
of
a
real
and
rational
life
the
city
of
those
few
hours
ago
was
surely
a
city
of
nightmares
the
impassable
river
flowed
between
macheson
leaned
back
in
his
carriage
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
blue
sunlit
sky
his
lips
moved
a
song
of
gratitude
was
in
his
heart
he
felt
like
the
prisoner
before
whom
the
iron
gates
have
been
rolled
back
disclosing
the
smiling
world

macheson
answered
do
talk
about
it
for
god
sake
holderness
roared
with
laughter
you
poor
idiot
he
exclaimed
been
on
the
i
believe
i
wish
i
known
i
have
come
it
all
very
well
to
laugh
macheson
answered
i
feel
like
a
man
who
been
living
in
a
sewer
are
you
cured
holderness
asked
abruptly
macheson
hesitated
as
yet
he
had
not
dared
to
ask
himself
that
question
holderness
watched
the
struggle
in
his
face
i
sorry
i
asked
you
that
he
said
quietly
look
here
i
know
what
you
come
to
me
for
and
i
can
give
it
you
you
can
start
at
once
if
you
like
work
macheson
asked
eagerly
you
mean
that
of
course
tons
of
it
henwood
at
his
wits
end
in
stepney
started
lecturing
and
the
thing
taken
on
but
he
ca
go
on
night
after
night
we
do
want
anything
either
then
i
want
help
with
the
paper
i
help
you
with
the
paper
as
soon
as
you
like
macheson
declared
i
like
to
go
to
stepney
too
but
could
we
hit
it
henwood
and
i
of
course
holderness
answered
what
are
you
thinking
of
man
you
have
become
a
have
you
not
i
macheson
answered
but
you
have
crystallized
your
ideas
into
a
cult
have
you
i
might
find
myself
on
the
other
side
of
the
traces
rot
holderness
answered
vigorously
look
here
this
is
what
we
call
ugliness
and
dirt
we
say
that
these
things
make
for
misery
we
say
that
it
is
every
man
duty
and
every
woman
too
to
keep
themselves
clean
and
for
the
sake
of
the
community
we
take
the
christian
code
it
is
the
most
complete
the
most
philosophic
the
most
beautiful
we
preach
it
not
from
the
christian
standpoint
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
man
of
common
sense
doctrinal
religions
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
the
great
bald
fact
remains
that
the
truth
has
not
been
vouchsafed
to
us
through
any
of
them
therefore
we
say
live
the
life
and
wait
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
we
believe
of
course
in
a
future
state
it
may
be
that
the
truth
awaits
us
there
you
can
work
to
that
ca
you
of
course
macheson
answered
but
do
you
rather
overlook
the
support
which
doctrine
gives
to
the
weak
and
superstitious
bah
there
are
the
strong
to
be
considered
holderness
declared
think
how
many
men
of
average
intelligence
chuck
the
whole
thing
because
they
ca
stomach
doctrine
besides
these
people
all
think
if
you
want
to
confirm
or
baptize
or
anything
of
that
sort
that
you
your
own
axe
to
grind
jolly
suspicious
lot
the
i
can
tell
you
i
go
and
see
henwood
macheson
declared
holderness
glanced
at
his
watch
we
have
something
to
eat
and
go
together
he
declared
look
here
i
really
pushed
or
i
would
bother
you
can
you
do
me
a
country
walk
in
november
for
the
paper
i
have
two
a
month
you
can
take
the
last
number
and
see
the
sort
of
thing
i
try
macheson
promised
you
can
give
me
a
couple
of
days
i
suppose
a
week
only
i
want
it
off
my
mind
you
can
get
out
somewhere
and
rub
up
your
impressions
we
dine
for
half
a
crown
in
soho
and
you
shall
tell
me
about
paris
macheson
groaned
shut
up
about
paris
he
begged
the
thought
of
it
like
a
nightmare
to
me
a
nightmare
full
of
puppet
gnomes
with
human
masks
and
the
faces
of
devils
underneath
the
masks
came
off
holderness
asked
macheson
shivered
they
did
he
answered
do
you
good
holderness
declared
coolly
locking
his
desk
i
been
through
it
so
long
as
the
masks
came
off
it
all
right
what
was
it
sent
you
there
victor
a
piece
of
madness
macheson
answered
in
a
low
tone
supreme
utter
madness
cured
oh
i
hope
so
macheson
answered
if
not
well
i
can
fight
holderness
stood
still
for
a
moment
there
was
a
queer
look
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
woman
once
victor
he
said
who
nearly
made
mincemeat
of
my
life
she
could
have
done
it
if
she
liked
and
she
was
the
sort
who
spares
she
died
thank
god
you
see
i
know
something
about
it
they
walked
out
arm
in
arm
and
not
a
word
passed
between
them
till
they
reached
the
street
then
holderness
called
a
hansom
i
feel
like
steak
he
declared
with
potatoes
maître
somehow
i
feel
particularly
like
steak
we
will
chuck
soho
and
dine
at
the
café
royal
they
talked
mostly
of
henwood
and
his
work
holderness
spoke
of
it
as
successful
but
the
man
himself
was
weakly
the
strain
of
holding
his
difficult
audience
night
after
night
had
begun
to
tell
on
him
macheson
help
would
be
invaluable
there
was
a
complete
school
of
night
classes
running
in
connexion
with
the
work
and
also
a
library
you
can
guess
where
the
money
came
from
for
those
he
added
smiling
on
the
women
side
there
was
only
the
cookery
and
the
care
of
the
children
all
very
imperfect
but
with
the
making
of
great
things
about
it
they
went
into
the
café
proper
for
their
coffee
sitting
at
a
table
and
holderness
called
for
dominoes
but
they
had
scarcely
begun
their
game
before
macheson
started
from
his
seat
and
without
a
word
of
explanation
strode
towards
the
door
he
was
just
in
time
to
stop
the
egress
of
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
slip
from
his
seat
and
try
to
leave
the
place
look
here
he
said
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
man
made
no
further
attempt
at
escape
he
was
very
shabby
and
thin
but
macheson
had
recognized
him
at
once
it
was
the
man
who
had
come
stealing
down
the
lane
from
thorpe
on
that
memorable
night
the
man
for
whose
escape
from
justice
he
was
responsible
my
friend
wo
interfere
with
us
macheson
said
leading
him
back
to
their
seats
sit
down
here
the
man
sat
down
quietly
holderness
took
up
a
paper
go
ahead
he
said
i
sha
listen
if
i
am
to
talk
the
man
said
i
must
have
some
absinthe
my
throat
is
dry
i
have
things
to
say
to
you
too
macheson
called
a
waiter
and
ordered
it
look
here
the
man
said
i
know
all
that
you
want
to
say
to
me
i
can
save
you
time
it
was
i
who
called
upon
old
hurd
it
was
out
of
kindness
that
i
went
he
has
a
daughter
whom
i
can
not
find
she
is
in
danger
and
i
went
to
warn
him
he
struck
me
first
he
lost
his
temper
he
would
not
tell
me
where
to
find
her
he
would
not
give
me
even
the
money
i
had
spent
on
my
journey
i
too
lost
my
temper
i
returned
the
blow
he
fell
down
and
i
was
frightened
so
i
ran
away
macheson
nodded
well
he
said
you
seem
to
have
struck
an
old
man
because
he
would
not
let
you
blackmail
him
and
i
like
a
fool
helped
you
to
escape
blackmail
the
man
looked
around
him
as
though
afraid
of
the
word
his
cheeks
were
sunken
but
his
brown
eyes
were
still
bright
it
that
he
said
i
brought
information
that
was
really
valuable
there
is
a
young
lady
somewhere
who
is
in
danger
of
her
life
i
came
to
warn
him
i
believed
what
i
had
always
been
told
that
she
was
his
daughter
i
found
out
that
it
was
a
lie
it
was
a
conspiracy
against
me
he
never
had
a
daughter
but
i
am
going
to
find
out
who
she
is
what
if
i
give
you
up
to
the
police
macheson
asked
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
whom
the
old
man
hurd
was
shielding
you
had
better
not
you
had
very
much
better
not
was
the
hoarse
reply
if
you
do
it
may
cost
a
woman
her
life
why
are
you
staying
on
in
england
macheson
asked
to
find
that
woman
and
i
will
find
her
he
added
with
glittering
eyes
listen
i
have
seen
her
riding
in
a
carriage
beautifully
dressed
with
coachman
and
footman
upon
the
box
an
aristocrat
i
always
said
that
she
was
that
it
was
a
plot
against
us
to
call
her
that
old
man
daughter
all
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
macheson
said
quietly
the
only
thing
i
have
to
consider
is
whether
i
ought
or
ought
not
to
hand
you
over
to
the
police
the
man
eyed
him
craftily
he
had
little
fear
if
you
did
sir
he
said
it
would
be
an
injustice
i
only
touched
the
old
man
in
macheson
looked
at
him
gravely
i
hope
that
that
is
the
truth
he
said
you
can
go
the
man
stood
up
he
did
not
immediately
depart
what
is
it
macheson
asked
i
was
wondering
sir
he
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
whether
you
could
not
give
me
an
idea
as
to
who
the
lady
was
who
called
herself
stephen
hurd
daughter
in
paris
six
years
ago
macheson
shook
his
head
i
have
no
idea
he
answered
curtly
the
man
shuffled
away
macheson
lit
a
cigarette
and
watched
him
for
a
moment
steadfastly
through
the
large
mirror
queer
sort
of
johnny
your
friend
holderness
remarked
he
a
bad
lot
i
afraid
macheson
answered
somehow
or
other
i
ca
help
wishing
that
i
had
seen
him
holderness
laughed
man
alive
he
said
it
a
good
thing
you
come
back
to
me
or
you
be
a
bundle
of
nerves
in
no
time
we
get
along
now
if
ready
you
might
find
something
to
say
to
i
know
pretty
well
pumped
dry
they
left
the
place
and
took
an
omnibus
citywards
chapter
vii
a
country
walk
it
was
exactly
such
a
day
as
he
would
have
chosen
for
his
purpose
when
macheson
stepped
out
of
the
train
at
the
wayside
station
and
set
his
face
towards
thorpe
a
strong
blustering
wind
blowing
down
from
the
hills
had
dried
the
road
of
all
save
a
slight
coating
of
mud
a
wind
fresh
from
the
forest
so
fresh
and
strong
that
he
walked
with
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
his
head
thrown
back
glad
to
breathe
it
in
his
lungs
and
feel
the
sting
of
it
on
his
cheeks
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
away
for
months
as
he
climbed
the
long
hill
towards
the
village
the
fields
now
were
brown
instead
of
green
a
pungent
smell
of
freshly
turned
earth
and
burning
wood
was
in
his
nostrils
the
hedges
and
trees
were
bare
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
great
house
itself
from
an
unexpected
point
everywhere
he
was
receiving
familiar
impressions
he
came
to
the
avenue
up
which
he
had
passed
on
his
first
visit
to
the
house
continually
he
met
carts
bearing
her
name
and
villagers
most
of
whom
he
noticed
with
some
surprise
looked
at
him
doubtfully
presently
he
arrived
at
the
village
itself
and
stopped
before
the
long
low
white
house
where
stephen
hurd
lived
he
paused
for
a
moment
hesitating
whether
to
fulfil
this
part
of
his
mission
now
or
to
wait
until
later
in
the
day
eventually
with
the
idea
of
getting
the
thing
over
he
opened
the
gate
and
rang
the
bell
he
was
shown
into
the
study
and
in
a
few
minutes
stephen
hurd
came
in
smoking
a
pipe
his
hands
in
his
pockets
when
he
saw
who
his
visitor
was
he
stopped
short
he
did
not
offer
his
hand
or
ask
macheson
to
sit
down
he
looked
at
him
with
a
heavy
frown
upon
his
face
you
wished
to
see
me
he
said
i
did
macheson
answered
perhaps
my
call
is
inopportune
i
have
come
from
london
practically
for
no
other
reason
than
to
ask
you
a
single
question
hurd
laughed
shortly
you
had
better
ask
it
then
he
said
i
thought
that
you
might
have
other
business
in
the
neighbourhood
preaching
off
eh
my
question
is
simply
this
macheson
said
calmly
have
you
or
had
you
ever
a
sister
a
dull
red
flush
streamed
into
the
young
man
face
he
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
stared
at
macheson
his
silence
for
several
moments
seemed
to
arise
from
the
fact
that
surprise
had
robbed
him
of
the
powers
of
speech
who
put
you
up
to
asking
that
he
demanded
sharply
macheson
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
my
question
is
a
simple
one
he
said
if
you
do
not
choose
to
answer
it
it
is
easy
for
me
to
procure
the
information
from
elsewhere
the
first
villager
i
met
would
tell
me
i
preferred
to
come
to
you
i
have
no
sister
hurd
said
slowly
i
never
had
now
you
must
tell
me
why
you
have
come
here
to
ask
me
this
i
am
told
macheson
said
that
years
ago
a
girl
in
paris
represented
herself
as
being
your
father
daughter
she
is
being
inquired
for
in
a
somewhat
mysterious
way
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
hurd
demanded
curtly
none
apparently
macheson
answered
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
information
i
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
but
stephen
hurd
barred
the
way
looking
into
his
face
macheson
saw
already
the
signs
of
a
change
there
his
eyes
were
a
little
wild
and
though
it
was
early
in
the
morning
he
smelt
of
spirits
no
you
do
he
declared
truculently
you
not
going
till
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
that
question
i
am
afraid
macheson
answered
that
i
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
you
will
tell
me
who
this
mysterious
person
is
hurd
declared
macheson
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
think
that
you
had
better
let
me
pass
not
yet
hurd
answered
look
here
you
been
in
communication
with
the
man
who
came
here
and
murdered
my
father
you
know
where
he
is
scarcely
that
was
it
macheson
answered
there
was
a
struggle
but
your
father
death
was
partly
owing
to
other
causes
however
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
that
with
you
i
came
to
ask
you
a
question
which
you
have
answered
if
you
will
permit
me
to
pass
i
shall
be
obliged
hurd
hesitated
for
a
moment
look
here
he
said
with
an
assumption
of
good
nature
there
no
reason
why
you
and
i
should
quarrel
i
want
to
know
who
put
you
up
to
asking
me
that
question
it
is
that
i
want
to
do
him
any
harm
guarantee
his
safety
if
you
like
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
only
anxious
to
meet
him
macheson
shook
his
head
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
myself
he
answered
in
any
case
i
could
not
give
you
any
information
stephen
hurd
stood
squarely
in
front
of
the
door
you
have
to
he
said
doggedly
that
all
there
is
about
it
macheson
took
a
step
forward
look
here
he
said
i
should
try
that
on
if
i
were
you
i
am
stronger
than
you
are
and
i
have
studied
boxing
i
do
care
about
fighting
but
i
am
going
to
leave
this
room
at
once
the
devil
you
are
hurd
cried
striking
at
him
take
that
you
canting
hypocrite
macheson
evaded
the
blow
with
ease
exactly
how
it
happened
he
never
knew
but
hurd
found
himself
a
few
seconds
later
on
his
back
and
alone
in
the
room
he
sprang
up
and
rushed
after
macheson
who
was
already
in
the
front
garden
his
attack
was
so
violent
that
macheson
had
no
alternative
he
knocked
him
into
the
middle
of
his
rose
bushes
and
opened
the
gate
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
the
last
person
in
the
world
whom
he
expected
to
see
in
thorpe
it
was
wilhelmina
herself
who
was
a
spectator
of
the
scene
macheson
she
said
gravely
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
macheson
was
taken
too
completely
by
surprise
to
frame
an
immediate
answer
stephen
hurd
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
dabbing
his
mouth
with
his
handkerchief
a
little
disagreement
between
us
he
said
with
an
evil
attempt
at
a
smile
we
will
settle
it
another
time
you
will
settle
it
now
the
lady
of
the
manor
said
with
authority
in
her
tone
shake
hands
if
you
please
at
once
i
can
not
have
this
sort
of
thing
going
on
in
the
village
macheson
held
out
his
hand
without
hesitation
the
quarrel
was
not
of
my
seeking
he
said
i
bear
you
no
hurd
will
you
shake
hands
no
stephen
hurd
answered
fiercely
macheson
hand
fell
to
his
side
i
am
sorry
he
said
you
will
reconsider
that
hurd
wilhelmina
said
quietly
no
he
answered
i
am
sorry
miss
to
seem
ungracious
but
there
are
reasons
why
i
can
not
accept
his
hand
he
knows
them
well
enough
we
can
not
possibly
be
friends
do
let
us
be
hypocrites
wilhelmina
turned
away
coldly
very
well
she
said
macheson
will
you
walk
with
me
a
little
way
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
with
pleasure
he
answered
i
sorry
hurd
he
added
turning
round
there
was
no
answer
together
they
walked
up
the
village
street
already
the
shock
of
seeing
her
had
passed
away
and
he
was
fighting
hard
against
the
gladness
which
possessed
him
he
had
paid
dearly
enough
already
for
his
folly
he
was
determined
that
there
should
be
no
return
of
it
which
way
were
you
going
she
asked
to
the
hills
he
answered
i
can
leave
you
at
the
church
entrance
but
before
you
go
i
am
not
going
she
answered
i
should
love
a
walk
i
will
come
with
you
to
the
hills
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
she
appeared
to
him
so
different
a
person
in
her
country
clothes
a
dark
brown
suit
with
short
skirt
a
brown
and
veil
she
was
not
much
more
than
a
child
after
all
her
mouth
was
a
little
sad
and
she
was
very
pale
and
seemed
tired
if
you
care
to
walk
so
far
he
said
gravely
and
with
me
what
am
i
expected
to
say
to
that
she
asked
demurely
i
think
that
you
know
what
i
mean
he
answered
avoiding
her
eyes
your
villagers
will
certainly
think
it
strange
to
see
their
mistress
walking
with
the
poor
missioner
who
was
allowed
to
hold
his
services
i
am
afraid
she
answered
that
my
people
have
learnt
to
expect
the
unexpected
from
me
now
tell
me
she
continued
what
has
brought
you
back
to
the
scene
of
your
persecutions
i
am
hoping
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
it
is
to
apologize
for
the
shockingly
rude
way
you
left
me
last
time
we
met
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
here
he
answered
i
came
for
two
reasons
first
to
collect
materials
for
a
short
article
in
a
magazine
and
secondly
to
ask
a
question
of
stephen
hurd
apparently
she
remarked
your
question
annoyed
him
he
seemed
annoyed
before
i
asked
it
macheson
remarked
i
seem
to
have
offended
him
somehow
or
other
i
should
imagine
she
said
drily
that
that
is
not
altogether
incomprehensible
to
you
so
she
knew
or
guessed
who
it
was
that
had
been
letty
companion
in
london
macheson
was
silent
they
walked
on
for
some
distance
climbing
all
the
time
till
wilhelmina
paused
breathless
and
leaned
against
a
gate
i
hope
said
she
that
you
are
collecting
your
impressions
if
so
i
am
sure
they
must
be
in
the
air
for
you
have
not
looked
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
smiled
and
stood
by
her
side
looking
downwards
the
village
lay
almost
at
their
feet
and
away
beyond
spread
the
country
still
and
silent
in
the
november
afternoon
the
wind
had
fallen
the
birds
were
songless
nothing
remained
of
the
busy
chorus
of
summer
sounds
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
plantation
the
peculiar
fragrance
of
freshly
turned
earth
from
the
ploughed
fields
opposite
and
of
the
carpet
of
wet
leaves
beneath
their
feet
had
taken
the
place
of
all
those
sweeter
perfumes
which
a
short
while
ago
had
seemed
to
belong
naturally
to
the
place
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
more
about
something
which
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
it
something
serious
she
asked
rather
he
admitted
her
eyebrows
were
faintly
contracted
she
looked
up
at
him
pathetically
it
will
keep
for
a
little
time
she
said
let
us
finish
our
walk
first
i
am
down
here
alone
and
have
been
dull
this
exercise
is
what
i
wanted
it
is
doing
me
good
i
will
not
have
my
afternoon
spoilt
see
i
have
the
key
of
the
gate
here
we
will
go
through
the
plantation
and
up
to
the
back
of
the
beacon
she
led
the
way
giving
him
no
time
to
protest
and
he
followed
her
vaguely
uneasy
through
the
plantation
their
feet
fell
noiselessly
upon
a
carpet
of
wet
leaves
outside
on
the
springy
turf
the
rabbits
scampered
away
in
hundreds
to
their
holes
then
they
began
to
climb
beneath
them
the
country
expanded
and
rolled
away
like
a
piece
of
patchwork
dimly
seen
through
a
veil
of
mist
wilhelmina
turned
towards
him
with
a
laugh
there
was
more
colour
now
in
her
cheeks
she
was
breathless
before
they
reached
the
summit
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
for
support
confess
she
said
you
like
me
better
here
than
in
london
you
you
are
more
natural
he
answered
you
are
more
like
what
i
would
have
you
be
she
sat
down
on
a
piece
of
grey
rock
they
were
at
the
summit
now
below
was
the
great
house
with
its
magnificent
avenues
and
park
the
tiny
village
and
the
quaint
church
beyond
a
spreading
landscape
of
undulating
meadows
and
land
the
same
thought
came
to
both
of
them
behold
she
murmured
my
possessions
he
nodded
you
should
be
very
proud
of
your
home
he
said
quietly
it
is
very
beautiful
she
turned
towards
him
her
face
was
as
cold
and
destitute
of
emotion
as
the
stone
on
which
she
sat
do
you
wonder
she
asked
why
i
have
never
married
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
matter
of
temperament
perhaps
he
said
you
are
inclined
to
be
independent
are
you
there
have
been
things
in
my
life
a
very
secret
chamber
she
said
slowly
i
think
that
some
day
i
shall
tell
you
about
it
for
i
may
need
help
i
shall
be
glad
he
said
simply
you
know
that
she
rose
and
shook
out
her
skirts
come
she
said
it
is
too
cold
to
sit
down
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
onetree
farm
foulton
must
give
us
some
tea
i
have
a
reason
too
she
added
more
slowly
for
taking
you
there
chapter
viii
the
missing
letty
macheson
knew
directly
they
entered
the
farm
that
wilhelmina
had
brought
him
here
for
some
purpose
for
foulton
straightened
herself
at
the
sight
of
him
and
forgot
even
her
usual
respectful
courtesy
to
the
lady
of
the
manor
i
have
brought
macheson
to
see
you
foulton
wilhelmina
said
we
want
you
to
give
us
some
tea
and
there
is
a
question
which
i
think
you
ought
to
ask
him
the
woman
was
trembling
she
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
no
words
if
you
like
wilhelmina
continued
calmly
i
will
ask
it
for
you
did
you
know
macheson
that
letty
foulton
has
left
home
and
has
gone
away
without
a
word
to
her
mother
i
did
not
know
it
macheson
answered
gravely
i
am
very
sorry
you
did
know
it
you
do
know
where
she
is
the
woman
demanded
fiercely
certainly
not
macheson
answered
how
should
i
the
woman
looked
bewildered
she
turned
towards
wilhelmina
as
though
for
an
explanation
macheson
has
himself
to
blame
wilhelmina
said
if
his
action
in
bringing
your
daughter
to
me
that
night
has
been
misunderstood
at
any
rate
he
can
not
refuse
to
tell
you
now
what
he
refused
to
tell
me
you
understand
macheson
she
added
turning
towards
him
foulton
insists
upon
knowing
with
whom
you
found
her
daughter
having
supper
that
night
in
london
macheson
hesitated
only
for
a
moment
your
daughter
was
with
stephen
hurd
foulton
he
said
the
woman
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
hastened
away
they
heard
her
sobbing
in
the
kitchen
wilhelmina
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
a
bore
she
remarked
we
sha
get
any
tea
people
of
this
sort
have
no
macheson
looked
at
her
sternly
have
the
people
here
he
asked
been
connecting
me
with
this
disappearance
i
suppose
so
she
answered
carelessly
rather
a
new
line
for
you
is
it
the
gay
lothario
it
your
own
fault
you
should
be
so
mysterious
you
did
believe
it
he
said
shortly
why
not
you
been
seeing
life
lately
have
you
you
did
believe
it
he
repeated
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
came
over
to
him
and
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
her
pale
face
was
upturned
to
his
it
seemed
open
to
him
to
transform
her
attitude
into
a
caress
of
course
not
dear
she
answered
if
any
one
else
did
they
will
soon
know
the
truth
all
the
same
he
muttered
it
horrible
we
must
do
something
she
moved
away
from
him
wearily
his
thoughts
were
full
of
the
tragedy
of
letty
foulton
disappearance
he
seemed
scarcely
to
know
that
she
had
been
almost
in
his
arms
he
turned
to
her
suddenly
i
shall
go
back
he
said
to
speak
once
more
with
stephen
hurd
she
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
things
there
which
terrified
her
he
had
moved
already
towards
the
door
but
she
stood
in
his
way
no
she
cried
it
is
not
your
affair
let
me
deal
with
him
he
shook
his
head
it
is
no
matter
he
said
for
a
woman
to
interfere
in
he
will
not
listen
to
you
she
continued
eagerly
he
will
tell
you
that
it
is
not
your
concern
it
is
the
concern
of
every
honest
man
he
interrupted
you
must
please
let
me
go
she
was
holding
his
arm
and
she
refused
to
withdraw
her
fingers
then
foulton
intervened
she
had
smoothed
her
hair
and
was
carrying
a
they
both
looked
at
her
as
though
fascinated
i
hope
i
have
not
kept
you
waiting
madam
she
said
quietly
i
had
to
send
ruth
up
for
the
cream
the
boy
at
loughborough
market
and
i
a
bit
shorthanded
i
oh
i
sorry
you
bothered
about
the
tea
foulton
wilhelmina
said
with
an
effort
but
how
good
it
looks
come
macheson
i
do
know
whether
you
had
any
lunch
but
i
have
i
perfectly
ravenous
i
some
sandwiches
in
my
pocket
macheson
answered
moving
slowly
to
the
table
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
forgotten
them
she
drew
off
her
gloves
and
seated
herself
before
the
teapot
all
the
time
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
macheson
she
was
feverishly
anxious
to
have
him
also
seat
himself
and
he
could
scarcely
look
away
from
the
woman
who
with
a
face
like
a
mask
was
calmly
arranging
the
things
from
the
tray
upon
the
table
when
she
left
the
room
he
drew
a
little
breath
do
they
feel
really
these
people
he
asked
or
are
they
stoics
we
feel
through
our
nerves
she
answered
and
they
have
many
is
that
too
much
cream
and
pass
the
strawberry
jam
please
he
ate
and
drank
mechanically
the
charm
of
this
simple
meal
alone
with
her
was
gone
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
tragedy
in
the
arrangement
of
the
table
she
talked
to
him
lightly
and
he
answered
what
he
scarcely
knew
suddenly
he
interposed
a
question
when
did
this
girl
letty
leave
home
he
asked
i
am
not
sure
she
answered
we
will
ask
mrs
foulton
foulton
came
silently
in
we
want
to
know
foulton
when
letty
went
away
wilhelmina
asked
a
week
ago
madam
foulton
answered
is
there
anything
else
you
will
be
wanting
nothing
thank
you
wilhelmina
answered
and
then
seeing
that
the
woman
lingered
she
continued
are
you
wanting
to
get
rid
of
us
the
woman
hesitated
it
is
that
madam
she
said
but
i
wanting
to
step
out
as
soon
as
possible
the
same
idea
occurred
at
once
to
both
wilhelmina
and
macheson
you
are
going
down
to
the
village
mrs
foulton
wilhelmina
asked
gravely
i
going
down
to
have
a
bit
of
talk
with
stephen
hurd
madam
she
answered
grimly
i
be
glad
to
clear
away
as
soon
as
convenient
wilhelmina
turned
round
in
her
chair
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
arm
foulton
she
said
macheson
and
i
are
going
to
see
him
at
once
leave
it
to
us
please
foulton
shook
her
head
doubtfully
letty
my
daughter
madam
thank
you
kindly
she
said
i
must
go
myself
wilhelmina
shook
her
head
no
she
said
firmly
you
can
go
and
see
him
afterwards
if
you
like
macheson
and
i
are
going
to
see
what
we
can
do
first
believe
me
foulton
it
will
be
better
for
letty
the
woman
was
shaken
and
wilhelmina
pushed
home
her
advantage
we
are
going
straight
to
the
village
now
foulton
she
said
you
will
only
have
to
be
patient
for
a
very
short
time
come
macheson
if
you
are
ready
we
will
start
they
walked
briskly
along
the
country
lane
through
the
early
twilight
they
said
little
to
one
another
macheson
was
profoundly
moved
by
the
tragedy
of
letty
disappearance
with
his
marvellous
gift
of
sympathy
he
had
understood
very
well
the
suffering
of
the
woman
whom
they
had
just
left
he
shivered
when
he
thought
of
the
child
with
every
step
they
took
his
face
resolved
itself
into
grimmer
lines
wilhelmina
was
forced
at
last
to
protest
after
all
she
said
touching
his
arm
this
young
man
will
scarcely
run
away
please
remember
that
i
am
not
an
athletic
person
and
i
have
not
much
breath
left
he
slackened
his
pace
at
once
i
am
sorry
he
said
i
was
forgetting
yes
she
answered
simply
you
were
forgetting
i
noticed
it
to
macheson
her
irritation
seemed
childish
unworthy
he
knew
so
little
of
women
or
their
moods
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
stephen
hurd
he
asked
abruptly
i
shall
make
him
marry
letty
foulton
she
answered
can
you
do
it
he
demanded
he
must
marry
her
or
go
she
declared
i
will
make
that
quite
clear
macheson
drew
a
little
breath
he
suddenly
realized
that
for
all
his
impetuosity
the
woman
who
walked
so
calmly
by
his
side
held
the
cards
he
slackened
his
pace
the
lane
had
narrowed
now
and
on
either
side
of
them
was
a
tall
holly
hedge
her
hand
stole
through
his
arm
well
she
said
softly
you
have
not
told
me
yet
whether
your
pilgrimage
to
paris
was
a
success
he
turned
upon
her
almost
fiercely
yes
he
answered
it
was
a
complete
success
i
have
an
atom
of
sentiment
left
thank
goodness
she
laughed
softly
i
do
believe
it
she
whispered
in
his
ear
you
went
abroad
to
be
cured
of
an
incurable
disease
do
you
imagine
that
the
mademoiselle
rosines
of
the
world
count
for
anything
you
foolish
foolish
person
do
you
imagine
that
if
i
had
not
known
you
i
should
have
let
you
go
i
am
not
one
of
your
tenants
he
answered
grimly
you
might
be
she
laughed
you
are
very
kind
he
declared
but
i
need
not
tell
you
that
nothing
in
this
world
would
induce
me
to
become
one
she
walked
on
humming
to
herself
he
was
hard
to
tame
she
told
herself
but
the
end
was
so
sure
yet
all
her
experience
of
his
sex
had
shown
her
nothing
like
this
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
played
such
a
part
was
it
only
the
novelty
which
she
found
attractive
she
stole
an
upward
glance
at
him
through
the
twilight
taller
and
more
powerful
than
ever
he
seemed
in
the
gathering
darkness
so
far
as
looks
were
concerned
he
was
certainly
desirable
enough
and
yet
the
world
her
world
was
full
of
handsome
men
it
must
be
something
else
which
he
possessed
some
other
less
obvious
gift
perhaps
that
flavour
of
puritanism
about
his
speech
and
deportment
of
which
she
was
always
conscious
he
resisted
where
other
men
not
only
succumbed
but
rushed
to
meet
their
fate
it
must
be
that
or
she
herself
became
suddenly
serious
she
looked
straight
ahead
down
the
darkening
lane
fate
could
surely
not
play
her
a
trick
so
scurvy
as
this
it
could
not
be
that
she
cared
her
hands
were
suddenly
clenched
a
little
cry
broke
from
her
lips
her
heart
was
beating
like
a
girl
the
delicious
thrill
of
youth
seemed
to
be
thawing
her
long
frozen
blood
not
again
she
prayed
not
again
it
was
a
catastrophe
this
grotesque
impossible
she
thrust
out
her
hands
as
though
to
guard
herself
from
some
impending
danger
macheson
turned
to
look
at
her
in
surprise
and
her
eyes
were
glowing
like
stars
is
anything
the
matter
he
asked
she
laughed
unnaturally
a
memory
she
answered
a
superstition
if
you
like
some
one
was
walking
over
the
grave
of
my
forgotten
days
she
pointed
to
the
front
of
the
low
white
house
now
only
a
few
yards
away
a
dogcart
stood
there
waiting
with
some
luggage
at
the
back
stephen
hurd
himself
dressed
for
travelling
was
standing
in
the
doorway
chapter
ix
foiled
we
seem
to
be
just
in
time
hurd
wilhelmina
said
do
you
mind
coming
back
for
a
moment
into
your
study
macheson
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
glanced
at
his
watch
he
was
wholly
unable
to
conceal
his
annoyance
at
their
appearance
i
am
afraid
he
said
with
strained
civility
that
i
can
only
spare
a
couple
of
minutes
you
are
going
to
town
she
asked
as
he
reluctantly
followed
her
yes
he
answered
white
wished
to
see
me
early
morning
about
the
new
leases
and
i
have
to
go
before
the
committee
about
this
loughborough
water
scheme
these
are
my
affairs
she
said
so
if
you
should
miss
your
train
the
responsibility
will
be
mine
i
can
spare
five
minutes
he
answered
but
i
can
not
miss
that
train
i
have
some
private
engagements
and
madam
he
continued
struggling
with
his
anger
i
beg
that
you
will
not
forget
that
even
if
i
am
in
your
employ
this
is
my
house
and
i
will
not
have
that
man
in
it
he
pointed
to
macheson
who
was
standing
upon
the
threshold
wilhelmina
stood
between
the
two
hurd
she
said
please
control
yourself
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
any
of
us
quarrel
macheson
and
i
are
here
to
speak
to
you
of
a
matter
in
which
he
has
become
concerned
i
asked
him
to
come
here
with
me
we
have
come
to
see
you
about
letty
what
about
her
he
demanded
with
some
attempt
at
bravado
we
find
that
there
is
an
impression
in
the
village
that
macheson
is
responsible
for
her
disappearance
hurd
seized
his
opportunity
without
a
second
hesitation
how
do
you
know
that
it
is
the
truth
he
demanded
he
would
be
the
first
of
these
missioners
who
have
turned
out
to
be
hypocrites
macheson
never
flinched
wilhelmina
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
hurd
she
said
we
will
not
waste
time
macheson
and
i
are
both
perfectly
aware
that
you
are
responsible
for
disappearance
it
it
false
he
declared
swallowing
with
an
effort
a
more
obnoxious
word
why
i
have
left
the
village
since
the
day
she
went
away
but
you
are
going
wilhelmina
remarked
he
flushed
i
going
away
on
business
he
answered
i
do
see
why
it
should
be
taken
for
granted
that
i
going
to
see
her
nevertheless
wilhelmina
said
quietly
between
us
three
there
the
slightest
doubt
about
it
i
tell
you
frankly
that
the
details
of
your
private
life
in
an
ordinary
way
do
not
interest
me
in
the
least
but
on
the
other
hand
i
will
not
have
you
playing
the
don
juan
amongst
the
daughters
of
my
tenants
you
have
been
very
foolish
and
you
will
have
to
pay
for
it
i
do
not
wish
to
make
you
lose
your
train
but
you
must
understand
that
if
you
ever
return
to
thorpe
you
must
bring
back
letty
foulton
as
your
wife
he
stared
at
her
incredulously
as
my
wife
he
exclaimed
precisely
wilhelmina
answered
i
will
give
her
a
wedding
present
of
a
thousand
pounds
and
i
will
see
that
your
own
position
here
is
made
a
permanent
one
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
beside
himself
with
anger
was
this
to
be
the
end
of
his
schemes
and
hopes
he
to
marry
the
pretty
uneducated
daughter
of
a
working
farmer
a
girl
too
who
was
his
already
for
the
asking
he
struggled
with
a
torrent
of
ugly
words
i
i
must
refuse
he
said
denying
himself
more
vigorous
terms
with
an
effort
she
looked
at
him
steadily
better
think
it
over
hurd
she
said
i
am
in
earnest
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
moved
towards
the
door
very
well
he
said
i
will
think
it
over
i
will
let
you
know
immediately
i
return
from
london
she
shook
her
head
you
can
take
as
long
as
you
like
to
reflect
she
answered
but
it
must
be
here
in
this
room
macheson
and
i
will
wait
he
turned
towards
her
miss
he
said
will
you
allow
me
to
speak
to
you
alone
for
two
minutes
she
shook
her
head
it
is
not
necessary
she
answered
macheson
does
not
count
you
can
say
whatever
you
will
before
him
a
smile
that
was
half
a
sneer
curved
his
lips
he
was
like
a
rat
in
a
corner
and
he
knew
that
he
must
fight
he
must
use
the
weapon
which
he
had
feared
with
a
coward
fear
the
matter
on
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
he
said
looking
straight
at
her
is
not
directly
connected
with
the
affair
which
we
have
been
discussing
if
you
will
give
me
two
minutes
i
think
i
can
make
you
understand
she
met
his
challenge
without
flinching
she
was
a
shade
paler
perhaps
the
little
glow
which
the
walk
through
the
enchanted
twilight
had
brought
into
her
cheeks
had
faded
away
but
her
gaze
was
as
cool
and
contemptuous
as
before
she
showed
no
sign
of
any
fear
of
any
desire
to
conciliate
i
think
she
said
that
i
can
understand
without
you
can
consider
that
we
are
alone
whatever
you
may
have
to
say
to
me
i
should
prefer
that
macheson
also
heard
macheson
looked
from
one
to
the
other
uneasily
shall
i
wait
in
the
passage
he
asked
i
should
be
within
call
certainly
not
she
answered
this
person
she
continued
indicating
stephen
with
a
scornful
gesture
is
i
believe
about
to
make
a
bungling
attempt
to
blackmail
me
i
should
much
prefer
that
you
were
present
stephen
hurd
drew
a
sharp
breath
her
words
stung
like
whips
i
do
know
about
blackmail
he
said
still
holding
himself
in
i
want
nothing
from
you
i
only
ask
to
be
left
alone
stop
this
nonsense
about
letty
foulton
and
let
me
catch
my
train
that
all
i
want
wilhelmina
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
are
a
very
wearisome
person
she
declared
did
you
ever
know
me
to
change
my
mind
every
word
i
have
said
to
you
i
absolutely
mean
no
more
no
less
one
of
the
veins
at
his
temple
was
protruding
he
was
passionately
angry
you
think
it
wise
he
cried
threateningly
to
make
an
enemy
of
me
she
laughed
derisively
a
laugh
as
soft
as
velvet
but
to
him
maddening
my
dear
young
man
she
said
carelessly
i
think
i
should
prefer
you
in
that
capacity
i
should
probably
see
less
of
you
he
took
a
quick
stride
forward
he
thrust
his
face
almost
into
hers
she
drew
back
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
you
he
cried
striking
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
to
pretend
to
care
what
becomes
of
any
fool
of
a
girl
who
chooses
to
take
a
lover
is
it
because
you
in
love
with
this
saint
here
he
struck
the
table
again
he
was
absolutely
beside
himself
with
rage
he
seemed
even
to
find
a
physical
difficulty
in
speech
wilhelmina
raised
her
eyebrows
go
on
she
said
coolly
i
am
curious
to
hear
the
rest
macheson
suddenly
intervened
he
stepped
between
the
two
this
has
gone
far
enough
he
said
sternly
hurd
you
are
losing
your
head
you
are
saying
things
you
will
be
sorry
for
afterwards
and
i
can
not
allow
you
to
speak
like
this
to
a
woman
in
my
presence
let
him
go
on
wilhelmina
said
calmly
i
am
beginning
to
find
him
interesting
hurd
laughed
fiercely
what
he
cried
you
want
to
hear
of
your
lover
the
man
you
took
from
the
gutters
of
paris
into
macheson
struck
him
full
across
the
mouth
but
wilhelmina
caught
at
his
arm
she
had
overestimated
her
courage
or
her
strength
he
was
only
just
in
time
to
save
her
from
falling
brute
she
muttered
and
the
colour
fled
from
her
cheeks
like
breath
from
a
macheson
laid
her
on
the
couch
and
rang
the
bell
suddenly
he
realized
that
they
were
alone
from
outside
came
the
sound
of
wheels
he
sprang
up
listening
wilhelmina
too
opened
her
eyes
she
waved
him
away
feebly
he
smiled
back
his
comprehension
the
servants
are
coming
he
said
i
can
hear
them
i
promise
you
that
if
he
catches
the
train
i
will
illustration
go
on
she
said
coolly
i
am
curious
to
hear
the
rest
page
he
vaulted
through
the
window
which
he
had
already
opened
the
sound
of
wheels
had
died
away
but
he
set
his
face
at
once
towards
the
station
running
with
long
easy
strides
and
gradually
increasing
his
pace
stephen
hurd
with
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
and
with
all
his
nerves
tingling
with
a
sense
of
fierce
excitement
looked
behind
him
continually
but
saw
nothing
long
before
he
reached
the
station
he
had
abandoned
all
fear
of
pursuit
yet
during
the
last
macheson
was
never
more
than
a
few
yards
from
him
and
on
pancras
platform
he
was
almost
the
first
person
he
encountered
macheson
by
god
he
almost
dropped
the
coat
he
was
carrying
he
looked
at
macheson
as
one
might
look
at
a
visitor
from
mars
it
was
not
possible
that
this
could
be
the
man
from
whom
he
had
fled
macheson
smiled
at
him
grimly
how
did
how
did
you
get
here
the
young
man
faltered
by
the
same
train
as
you
macheson
answered
how
else
where
are
you
going
to
meet
letty
hurd
answered
with
a
curse
why
the
devil
ca
you
mind
your
own
business
he
demanded
this
is
my
business
macheson
answered
then
he
turned
abruptly
round
towards
the
hesitating
figure
of
the
girl
who
had
suddenly
paused
in
her
swift
approach
it
is
my
business
to
take
you
home
letty
he
said
i
have
come
to
fetch
you
letty
looked
appealingly
towards
stephen
hurd
what
she
saw
in
his
face
however
only
terrified
her
look
here
he
said
thickly
i
had
almost
enough
of
this
you
can
go
to
the
devil
you
and
miss
too
i
wo
allow
any
one
to
meddle
in
my
private
concerns
come
along
letty
he
would
have
led
her
away
but
macheson
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
he
kept
his
place
by
the
girl
side
letty
he
said
are
you
married
to
him
not
yet
she
answered
hesitatingly
but
we
are
going
to
be
where
are
you
going
to
now
she
glanced
towards
stephen
i
am
going
to
take
her
away
with
me
he
declared
sullenly
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
luggage
on
this
cab
letty
macheson
said
a
few
hours
ago
miss
offered
stephen
hurd
a
dowry
for
you
of
a
thousand
pounds
if
he
would
promise
to
bring
you
back
as
his
wife
he
refused
he
has
not
the
slightest
intention
of
making
you
his
wife
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
speak
so
plainly
but
you
see
we
have
much
time
for
beating
about
the
bush
have
we
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
to
berkeley
square
brown
will
look
after
you
she
turned
towards
the
young
man
piteously
stephen
she
said
tell
macheson
that
he
is
mistaken
we
are
going
to
be
married
are
we
yes
he
answered
at
least
i
always
meant
to
marry
you
what
i
shall
do
if
every
one
starts
bullying
me
i
sure
i
do
know
cut
the
whole
lot
of
you
i
think
and
be
off
to
the
colonies
you
do
mean
that
stephen
she
begged
he
pointed
to
the
cab
laden
now
with
his
luggage
will
you
get
in
or
wo
you
letty
he
asked
she
shrank
back
stephen
she
said
i
thought
that
you
were
going
to
bring
mother
up
with
you
he
laughed
hardly
your
mother
was
ready
he
said
we
can
send
for
her
later
do
you
think
stephen
she
pleaded
that
it
would
be
nice
for
me
to
stay
with
brown
until
until
we
are
married
if
you
go
to
brown
he
said
gruffly
you
can
stay
with
her
that
all
i
wo
be
fooled
about
any
longer
once
and
for
all
are
you
coming
she
took
a
hesitating
step
forward
but
macheson
led
her
firmly
towards
another
hansom
no
he
answered
she
is
not
you
know
where
she
will
be
when
you
have
the
marriage
license
stephen
sprang
into
his
cab
with
an
oath
even
then
letty
would
have
followed
him
but
macheson
held
her
arm
you
stay
here
letty
he
said
firmly
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
but
she
obeyed
chapter
x
mysteries
in
mayfair
that
night
and
for
many
nights
afterwards
macheson
devoted
himself
to
his
work
in
the
east
end
the
fascination
of
the
thing
grew
upon
him
he
threw
himself
into
his
task
with
an
energy
which
carried
him
often
out
of
his
own
life
and
made
forgetfulness
an
easy
task
night
after
night
they
came
these
tired
women
with
a
sprinkling
of
sullen
men
night
after
night
he
pleaded
and
reasoned
with
them
striving
with
almost
passionate
earnestness
to
show
them
how
to
make
the
best
of
the
poor
thing
they
called
life
gradually
his
efforts
began
to
tell
upon
himself
he
grew
thinner
there
were
shadows
under
his
eyes
a
curious
intangible
depression
seemed
to
settle
upon
him
holderness
one
night
sought
him
out
and
insisted
upon
dinner
together
look
here
victor
he
said
i
have
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
better
listen
do
sit
there
staring
round
the
place
as
though
you
saw
ghosts
everywhere
macheson
smiled
mirthlessly
but
that
is
just
what
i
do
see
he
answered
the
conscience
of
every
man
who
knows
must
be
haunted
with
them
the
ghosts
of
starving
men
and
unsexed
women
what
keeps
their
hands
from
our
throats
dick
common
sense
you
idiot
holderness
answered
cheerfully
there
a
refuse
heap
for
every
one
of
nature
functions
you
may
try
to
rake
it
out
and
cleanse
it
but
there
is
much
to
be
done
hang
that
mission
work
victor
it
broken
more
hearts
than
anything
else
on
earth
a
man
can
but
do
what
he
may
the
refuse
heap
is
man
work
macheson
muttered
but
not
wholly
his
responsibility
holderness
declared
we
part
of
the
machine
but
remember
the
wheels
are
driven
by
fate
or
god
or
whatever
the
hidden
motive
force
of
the
universe
may
be
do
lose
yourself
macheson
sentiment
a
good
thing
under
control
it
a
sickly
master
you
call
it
sentiment
if
one
feels
the
horror
of
this
garbage
heap
come
and
look
into
their
faces
i
done
it
holderness
declared
i
been
through
it
all
hang
it
all
do
you
forget
that
i
the
editor
of
a
socialist
magazine
no
feel
it
you
must
but
do
let
it
upset
your
mental
balance
do
lose
your
values
macheson
left
his
friend
in
a
saner
frame
of
mind
his
words
came
back
to
him
that
night
as
he
watched
the
little
stream
of
people
file
out
from
the
bare
building
with
its
rows
of
cheap
cane
chairs
it
was
so
true
to
give
way
to
despair
was
simply
to
indulge
in
a
sentimental
debauch
yet
in
a
sense
he
had
never
felt
so
completely
the
pitiful
ineffectiveness
of
his
task
how
could
he
preach
the
christian
morality
expound
the
christian
doctrines
to
a
people
whose
very
sufferings
whose
constant
agony
was
a
hideous
and
glaring
proof
that
by
the
greater
part
of
the
world
those
doctrines
were
ignored
a
man
was
shown
into
his
room
afterwards
as
he
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
almost
with
relief
macheson
saw
that
he
at
least
had
no
pitiful
tale
to
tell
he
was
a
small
dapper
man
well
dressed
and
spoke
with
a
slight
american
accent
macheson
he
said
i
taking
the
liberty
of
introducing
myself
peter
drayton
my
name
is
never
mind
my
profession
it
would
interest
you
macheson
nodded
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
with
some
curiosity
say
i
been
very
much
interested
in
these
talks
of
yours
to
the
people
drayton
remarked
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
on
the
wrong
end
of
the
stick
that
why
i
here
you
saying
the
right
things
and
you
got
the
knack
of
saying
them
so
that
people
have
just
got
to
listen
but
you
saying
them
to
the
wrong
crowd
i
do
understand
macheson
was
forced
to
confess
well
i
reckon
it
simple
enough
drayton
answered
these
people
here
do
need
to
have
their
own
misery
thrust
down
their
throats
even
while
you
trying
to
show
them
how
to
bear
it
it
the
parties
who
are
responsible
for
it
all
that
you
want
to
go
for
see
what
i
mean
i
think
so
macheson
admitted
but
look
here
drayton
interrupted
you
a
man
of
common
sense
and
you
know
that
life
more
or
less
a
fight
those
that
are
licked
live
here
in
whitechapel
if
you
can
call
it
living
and
those
who
win
get
to
belgravia
it
a
pitiless
sort
of
affair
this
fight
but
there
it
is
now
which
of
the
two
do
you
think
need
preaching
to
these
people
or
the
people
who
are
responsible
for
them
you
started
a
mission
in
whitechapel
it
would
have
been
more
logical
if
there
a
word
of
truth
in
your
religion
to
have
started
it
in
mayfair
macheson
laughed
they
would
listen
to
me
he
declared
i
see
to
that
drayton
answered
quickly
it
my
business
i
want
you
to
give
a
course
of
well
we
call
them
lectures
in
the
west
end
you
can
say
what
you
like
you
can
pitch
into
as
hot
as
hell
guarantee
you
a
crowded
audience
every
time
i
have
no
interest
in
those
people
macheson
said
why
should
i
go
and
lecture
to
them
my
sympathies
are
all
down
here
exactly
drayton
answered
i
want
you
to
stir
up
the
people
who
can
really
help
people
who
can
give
millions
pull
down
these
miles
of
rat
holes
endow
farms
here
and
abroad
lash
them
till
their
conscience
squeaks
see
what
the
good
of
preaching
to
these
people
that
wo
do
any
good
you
want
to
preach
to
the
really
ignorant
the
really
depraved
the
do
i
understand
macheson
asked
that
you
have
a
definite
scheme
in
which
you
are
inviting
me
to
take
part
drayton
lit
a
cigarette
and
led
the
way
out
look
here
he
said
i
walk
with
you
as
far
as
you
going
and
tell
you
all
about
it
it
was
a
sort
of
pilgrimage
which
macheson
undertook
during
these
restless
nights
a
walk
seemingly
purposeless
the
sole
luxury
which
he
permitted
himself
always
about
the
same
hour
he
found
himself
on
the
garden
side
of
berkeley
square
always
he
stood
and
looked
for
a
period
of
time
of
which
he
took
no
count
at
the
tall
dimly
lit
house
across
whose
portals
he
had
once
passed
into
fairyland
then
came
a
night
when
everything
was
changed
lights
flashed
from
the
windows
freshly
painted
had
been
filled
with
flowers
scarce
enough
now
everything
seemed
to
denote
a
sudden
spirit
of
activity
macheson
stood
and
watched
with
a
curious
sense
of
excitement
stirring
in
his
blood
he
knew
very
well
what
was
happening
she
was
coming
perhaps
had
already
arrived
in
town
he
realized
as
he
stood
there
a
silent
motionless
figure
how
far
gone
in
his
folly
he
really
was
how
closely
woven
were
the
bonds
that
held
him
for
time
seemed
to
him
of
no
account
beside
the
chance
of
seeing
her
if
only
for
a
moment
as
she
passed
in
or
out
he
never
knew
how
long
he
waited
there
it
was
long
enough
however
for
his
patience
to
be
rewarded
smoothly
with
flashing
lights
a
little
electric
brougham
turned
into
the
square
and
pulled
up
immediately
opposite
to
him
the
tall
footman
sprang
to
the
ground
the
door
flew
open
he
saw
a
slim
familiar
figure
veiled
and
dressed
in
a
dark
travelling
costume
pass
leisurely
up
the
steps
and
into
the
arc
of
light
which
streamed
through
the
open
door
the
brougham
glided
away
the
door
was
closed
she
was
gone
still
macheson
leaned
forward
watching
the
spot
where
she
had
been
his
heart
thumping
against
his
sides
his
senses
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
her
coming
suddenly
his
attention
was
diverted
in
a
curious
manner
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
not
the
only
watcher
under
the
chestnut
trees
a
man
had
stolen
out
from
amongst
the
deeper
shadows
close
up
to
the
railings
and
was
standing
by
his
side
macheson
recognized
him
with
a
start
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
abruptly
his
too
showed
signs
of
excitement
his
cheeks
were
flushed
he
pointed
across
the
road
with
shaking
finger
and
looked
up
into
macheson
face
with
a
triumphant
chuckle
run
to
earth
at
last
he
exclaimed
you
saw
her
you
saw
her
too
i
saw
a
lady
enter
that
house
macheson
answered
what
of
it
the
man
whom
he
had
once
befriended
drew
a
breath
between
his
clenched
teeth
there
she
goes
he
muttered
the
woman
who
dared
to
call
herself
the
daughter
of
a
poor
the
woman
who
is
deceiving
her
world
as
she
deceived
us
once
bah
it
is
finished
he
started
to
cross
the
road
macheson
kept
by
his
side
where
are
you
off
to
he
asked
the
man
pointed
to
the
brilliantly
lit
house
there
he
answered
fiercely
i
am
going
to
see
her
at
once
she
shall
not
escape
me
this
time
what
do
you
want
with
her
macheson
asked
money
or
exposure
such
an
exposure
the
man
answered
but
she
will
pay
she
owes
a
good
deal
but
she
will
pay
and
supposing
macheson
said
that
i
were
to
tell
you
that
this
lady
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
that
i
will
not
have
you
intrude
upon
her
what
then
something
venomous
gleamed
in
the
man
eyes
a
short
unpleasant
laugh
escaped
him
not
all
the
devils
in
hell
he
declared
would
keep
me
from
going
to
her
for
five
years
she
fooled
us
not
a
day
longer
not
an
hour
macheson
hand
rested
lightly
upon
the
man
shoulder
can
you
reach
her
from
prison
he
asked
calmly
the
man
turned
and
snarled
at
him
he
knew
well
enough
that
escape
or
resistance
alike
was
hopeless
he
was
like
a
pigmy
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
held
him
this
is
your
affair
he
pleaded
earnestly
let
me
go
or
i
shall
do
you
a
mischief
some
day
remember
it
was
you
who
helped
me
to
escape
you
ca
give
me
away
now
i
helped
you
to
escape
macheson
said
but
i
did
not
know
what
you
had
done
there
is
another
matter
you
have
to
go
away
from
here
quietly
and
swear
never
to
molest
the
man
ducked
with
a
sudden
backward
movement
and
tried
to
escape
but
macheson
was
on
his
guard
you
are
a
fool
the
man
hissed
out
his
small
eyes
glittering
as
though
touched
with
fire
his
thick
red
lips
parted
showing
his
ugly
teeth
it
is
money
alone
i
want
from
her
i
have
but
to
breathe
her
name
and
this
address
in
a
certain
quarter
of
paris
and
there
are
others
who
would
take
her
life
let
me
go
then
macheson
was
conscious
of
a
familiar
figure
crossing
the
street
in
their
direction
he
had
seen
him
come
furtively
out
of
the
house
they
had
been
watching
and
had
recognized
him
at
once
it
was
stephen
hurd
keeping
his
grasp
upon
his
captive
shoulder
macheson
intercepted
him
hurd
he
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
hurd
started
and
his
face
darkened
with
anger
when
he
saw
who
it
was
that
had
accosted
him
macheson
continued
hurriedly
look
here
he
said
i
owe
you
this
at
any
rate
i
have
just
caught
our
friend
here
watching
this
house
have
you
ever
seen
him
before
hurd
looked
down
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
with
an
evil
shrug
of
the
shoulders
had
resigned
himself
for
the
present
to
the
inevitable
never
he
answered
ca
say
i
particularly
anxious
to
see
him
again
convert
of
yours
he
asked
with
a
sneer
he
is
the
man
who
visited
your
father
on
the
night
of
his
death
macheson
said
stephen
hurd
was
like
a
man
electrified
he
seized
hold
of
the
arm
in
excitement
is
this
true
he
demanded
the
man
blinked
his
eyes
you
have
to
prove
it
he
said
i
admit
nothing
you
can
leave
him
to
me
stephen
hurd
said
turning
to
macheson
macheson
nodded
and
prepared
to
walk
on
there
is
a
behind
to
the
left
he
remarked
hurd
took
no
notice
he
had
thrust
his
arm
tightly
through
the
other
man
i
have
been
looking
for
you
he
said
eagerly
we
must
have
a
talk
together
we
will
take
this
hansom
he
added
hailing
one
the
man
drew
back
are
you
going
to
take
me
to
the
he
demanded
no
hurd
answered
roughly
what
good
would
that
do
me
get
in
café
monico
chapter
xi
the
way
of
salvation
holderness
leaned
back
in
his
worn
leather
chair
and
shouted
with
laughter
he
treated
with
absolute
indifference
the
white
anger
in
macheson
face
victor
he
cried
do
look
at
me
as
though
you
wanted
to
punch
my
head
down
on
your
knees
man
and
pray
for
a
sense
of
humour
it
the
very
salt
of
life
that
all
very
well
macheson
answered
but
i
ca
exactly
see
that
because
you
deficient
holderness
shouted
wiping
the
tears
from
his
eyes
i
have
laughed
so
much
for
ages
here
you
come
from
the
east
to
the
west
with
all
the
world
tragedy
tearing
at
your
heart
flowing
from
your
lips
a
flagellator
a
hater
of
the
people
to
whom
you
speak
seeking
only
to
strike
and
to
wound
and
they
accept
you
as
a
new
sensation
they
bare
their
back
to
your
whip
they
have
made
you
the
fashion
oh
this
funny
funny
world
of
ours
macheson
smiled
grimly
i
grant
you
the
elements
of
humour
in
the
situation
he
said
but
you
can
scarcely
expect
me
to
appreciate
it
can
you
i
never
came
here
to
play
the
mountebank
to
provide
a
new
sensation
for
these
tired
dolls
of
society
dick
do
you
think
paul
could
have
opened
their
eyes
holderness
shook
his
head
i
do
know
he
declared
they
a
difficult
class
you
see
they
have
pluck
and
a
sort
of
fantastic
philosophy
which
goes
with
breeding
they
not
easily
scared
macheson
thought
of
his
friend
words
later
in
the
afternoon
when
he
stood
on
the
slightly
raised
platform
of
the
fashionable
room
where
his
lectures
were
given
not
a
chair
was
empty
macheson
as
he
entered
gazed
long
and
steadily
into
those
rows
of
tired
faces
and
felt
in
the
atmosphere
the
delicate
wave
of
perfume
shaken
from
their
clothes
the
indescribable
effect
of
femininity
there
were
men
there
too
mostly
as
escorts
correctly
dressed
bored
vacuous
from
intent
rather
than
lack
of
intelligence
macheson
himself
carelessly
dressed
from
design
his
fine
figure
with
untidy
boots
and
shock
hair
felt
his
anger
slowly
rising
as
he
marked
the
stir
which
his
coming
had
caused
he
to
be
the
showman
of
such
a
crowd
it
was
maddening
that
day
he
spoke
to
them
without
even
the
ghost
of
a
smile
parting
his
lips
he
sought
to
create
no
sympathy
he
cracked
his
whip
with
the
cool
deliberation
of
a
russian
executioner
i
was
asked
the
other
day
he
remarked
by
an
enterprising
journalist
what
made
me
decide
to
come
here
and
deliver
these
lectures
to
you
i
did
not
tell
him
it
is
because
i
wanted
to
speak
to
the
most
ignorant
class
in
christendom
you
are
that
class
if
you
have
intelligence
you
make
it
the
servant
of
your
whims
if
you
have
imagination
you
use
it
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
your
vices
you
are
worse
than
the
ostrich
who
buries
his
head
in
the
sand
you
prefer
to
go
underground
altogether
as
you
sit
here
with
every
tick
of
your
jewelled
watches
out
in
the
world
of
which
in
your
sublime
selfishness
you
know
nothing
a
child
dies
a
woman
is
given
to
sin
a
man
heart
is
broken
what
do
you
care
what
do
you
know
of
that
infernal
that
everlasting
tragedy
of
sin
and
suffering
that
seethes
around
you
why
should
you
care
your
life
is
attuned
to
the
most
pagan
philosophy
which
all
the
ages
of
sin
have
evolved
you
have
sunk
so
low
that
you
are
content
to
sit
and
listen
to
the
story
of
your
ignominy
what
fascination
was
it
that
kept
them
in
their
places
holderness
who
was
sitting
in
the
last
row
fully
expected
to
see
them
leave
their
seats
and
stream
out
macheson
himself
would
not
have
been
surprised
his
voice
had
no
particular
charm
his
words
were
simple
words
of
abuse
he
attempted
no
rhetorical
flourishes
nor
any
of
the
tricks
of
oratory
he
stood
there
like
a
disgusted
schoolmaster
lecturing
a
rebellious
and
backward
school
holderness
when
he
saw
that
no
one
left
chuckled
to
himself
macheson
aware
that
his
powers
of
invective
were
spent
suddenly
changed
his
tone
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
told
them
every
one
was
seeking
to
fashion
his
life
according
to
some
hidden
philosophy
some
unrealized
ideal
with
religion
as
it
was
commonly
understood
he
had
in
that
place
at
any
rate
nothing
to
do
even
the
selfish
drifting
down
the
stream
of
idle
pleasures
which
constituted
life
for
most
of
them
was
the
passive
acceptance
in
their
consciousness
of
the
old
fainéant
philosophy
of
laissez
faire
had
they
any
idea
of
the
magnificent
stimulus
which
work
could
give
to
the
emptiest
life
for
sake
alone
they
were
willing
sometimes
to
step
out
of
the
rut
of
their
existence
to
discipline
their
bodies
at
foreign
to
take
up
courses
of
physical
exercises
as
prescribed
by
the
fashionable
crank
of
the
moment
what
they
would
do
for
their
bodies
why
should
they
not
try
for
their
souls
the
one
was
surely
as
near
decay
as
the
other
the
care
of
it
if
only
they
would
realize
it
was
ten
thousand
times
more
important
he
had
called
them
perhaps
many
hard
names
there
was
one
he
could
not
call
them
he
could
not
call
them
cowards
on
the
contrary
he
thought
them
the
bravest
people
he
had
ever
known
to
live
the
lives
they
did
and
await
the
end
with
the
equanimity
they
showed
the
equivalent
of
hell
whatever
it
might
be
had
evidently
no
terrors
for
them
he
concluded
his
address
abruptly
as
his
custom
was
a
few
minutes
later
and
turned
at
once
to
leave
the
platform
but
this
afternoon
an
unexpected
incident
occurred
a
man
from
the
middle
of
the
audience
rose
up
and
called
to
him
by
name
macheson
surprised
paused
and
turned
round
it
was
deyes
who
stood
there
immaculately
dressed
in
morning
clothes
his
long
face
pale
as
ever
his
manner
absolutely
and
entirely
composed
he
was
swinging
his
eyeglass
by
its
narrow
black
ribbon
and
leaning
a
little
forward
sir
he
said
once
more
addressing
macheson
as
one
of
the
audience
whose
shortcomings
have
so
er
profoundly
impressed
you
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
you
a
question
i
ask
it
of
you
publicly
because
i
imagine
that
there
are
many
others
here
besides
myself
to
whom
your
answer
may
prove
interesting
macheson
came
slowly
to
the
front
of
the
platform
ask
your
question
sir
by
all
means
he
said
deyes
bowed
you
remind
me
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
he
continued
of
the
prophet
who
went
about
with
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
head
crying
woe
woe
but
who
was
either
unable
or
unwilling
to
suggest
any
means
by
which
that
doleful
cry
might
be
replaced
by
one
of
more
cheerful
import
in
plain
words
sir
according
to
your
lights
what
must
we
do
to
be
saved
there
was
a
murmur
of
interest
amongst
the
audience
there
were
many
upon
whom
macheson
stinging
words
and
direct
denunciation
had
left
their
mark
they
sat
up
eagerly
and
waited
for
his
answer
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
looked
thoughtfully
into
their
faces
in
this
city
he
said
it
should
not
be
necessary
for
any
one
to
ask
that
question
my
answer
may
seem
trite
and
hackneyed
yet
if
you
will
accept
it
you
may
come
to
the
truth
take
a
hansom
cab
and
drive
as
far
say
as
whitechapel
walk
in
any
direction
for
half
a
mile
look
into
the
faces
of
the
men
the
women
and
the
children
then
go
home
and
think
you
will
say
at
first
nothing
can
be
done
for
these
people
they
have
dropped
down
too
low
they
have
lost
their
humanity
they
only
justify
the
natural
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
think
again
a
hemisphere
may
divide
the
east
and
the
west
of
this
great
city
but
these
are
human
beings
as
you
are
a
human
being
they
are
your
brothers
and
your
sisters
consider
for
a
moment
this
natural
law
of
yours
it
is
based
upon
the
principle
of
the
those
who
are
down
are
down
because
the
others
are
up
those
men
are
beasts
those
women
are
unsexed
those
children
are
growing
up
with
dirt
upon
their
bodies
and
sin
in
their
hearts
because
you
others
are
what
you
are
because
consider
that
consider
it
well
and
take
up
your
responsibility
they
die
that
you
may
flourish
do
you
think
that
the
will
be
always
one
way
a
revolution
in
this
world
or
justice
in
the
next
which
would
you
rather
face
deyes
bowed
slightly
you
have
given
me
an
answer
sir
for
which
i
thank
you
he
answered
but
you
must
allow
me
to
remind
you
of
the
great
stream
of
gold
which
flows
all
the
while
from
the
west
to
the
east
hospitals
mission
houses
orphanages
colonial
farms
are
we
to
have
no
credit
for
these
very
little
macheson
answered
for
you
give
of
your
superfluity
charity
has
little
to
do
with
the
besides
you
must
remember
this
i
am
not
here
to
plead
the
cause
of
the
east
i
am
here
to
talk
to
you
of
your
own
lives
i
represent
if
you
are
pleased
to
have
it
so
the
sandow
of
your
spiritual
body
i
ask
you
to
submit
your
souls
to
my
treatment
as
the
professor
of
physical
culture
would
ask
for
your
bodies
this
is
not
a
matter
of
religion
at
all
it
is
a
matter
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
of
philosophy
your
souls
need
exercise
you
need
a
course
of
thinking
and
working
for
the
good
of
some
one
else
not
for
your
own
benefit
give
up
one
sin
in
your
life
and
replace
it
with
a
effort
to
rescue
one
unfortunate
person
from
sin
and
despair
and
you
will
gain
what
i
understand
to
be
the
desire
of
all
of
you
a
new
pleasure
briefly
for
your
own
sakes
from
your
own
point
of
view
it
is
a
personal
charity
which
i
am
advocating
as
distinguished
from
the
charity
of
the
one
more
question
macheson
deyes
continued
quietly
where
do
we
find
the
lost
souls
i
mean
upon
what
principle
of
selection
do
we
work
there
are
many
excellent
institutions
through
which
you
can
come
into
touch
with
them
macheson
answered
you
can
hear
of
these
through
the
clergyman
of
your
own
parish
or
the
bishop
of
london
deyes
thanked
him
and
sat
down
the
lecture
was
over
and
the
people
slowly
dispersed
macheson
passed
into
the
room
at
the
back
of
the
platform
drayton
who
was
waiting
for
him
there
pushed
over
a
box
of
cigarettes
he
knew
that
macheson
loved
to
smoke
directly
he
had
finished
talking
macheson
he
said
solemnly
you
a
marvel
why
in
my
country
i
guess
they
come
and
scratch
your
eyes
out
before
they
stand
plain
speaking
like
that
macheson
was
looking
away
into
vacancy
i
wonder
he
said
softly
if
it
does
any
good
any
real
good
drayton
who
was
looking
through
a
with
gleaming
eyes
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
thought
better
of
it
he
pointed
instead
towards
the
table
the
usual
pile
of
notes
was
there
all
the
latest
novelties
in
fancy
stationery
were
represented
there
crested
coroneted
scented
macheson
began
to
tear
them
open
and
as
rapidly
destroy
them
with
a
little
gesture
of
disgust
they
were
mostly
of
the
same
type
the
girls
were
all
so
anxious
to
do
a
little
good
so
tired
of
the
wearisome
round
of
society
would
macheson
be
very
kind
and
give
them
some
personal
advice
could
he
meet
them
somewhere
or
might
they
come
and
see
him
they
did
hope
that
he
would
think
them
bold
it
would
be
such
a
help
to
talk
to
him
the
married
ladies
were
bolder
still
they
felt
the
same
craving
for
advice
but
their
proposals
were
more
definite
macheson
must
come
and
see
them
they
would
be
quite
alone
underlined
there
should
be
no
one
else
there
to
worry
him
then
followed
times
and
addresses
one
lady
whose
coronet
and
motto
were
familiar
to
him
would
take
no
denial
he
was
to
come
that
afternoon
her
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
side
door
and
would
bring
him
directly
to
her
macheson
looked
up
quickly
through
the
window
he
could
see
a
small
brougham
with
cockaded
footman
and
coachman
waiting
outside
he
swept
all
the
notes
into
the
flames
for
heaven
sake
go
and
send
that
carriage
away
drayton
he
begged
drayton
laughed
and
disappeared
on
the
table
there
remained
one
more
note
a
square
envelope
less
conspicuous
perhaps
than
the
others
but
more
macheson
broke
the
seal
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
were
scrawled
these
few
lines
only
for
heaven
sake
come
to
me
at
wilhelmina
he
started
and
caught
up
his
hat
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
his
way
to
berkeley
square
chapter
xii
jean
le
roi
over
a
table
in
a
retired
corner
of
the
café
stephen
hurd
listened
to
the
story
of
the
man
whom
macheson
had
delivered
over
to
him
and
the
longer
he
listened
the
more
interesting
he
found
it
when
at
last
all
was
told
the
table
itself
was
strewn
with
cigarette
stumps
and
their
glasses
had
three
times
been
replenished
the
faces
of
both
men
were
flushed
you
see
the
little
man
said
glancing
for
a
moment
at
his
fingers
and
then
beginning
to
puff
furiously
at
a
fresh
cigarette
the
time
is
of
the
shortest
jean
le
roi
well
his
time
is
up
he
may
be
here
the
next
day
who
can
tell
and
when
he
comes
he
will
kill
her
that
is
certain
hurd
shuddered
and
drank
some
of
his
whisky
look
here
he
said
we
must
have
that
revenge
of
course
he
will
want
but
there
are
other
ways
the
little
man
blinked
his
eyes
you
do
not
know
jean
le
roi
he
said
to
him
it
is
a
pastime
to
kill
for
myself
i
do
not
know
the
passions
as
he
would
know
them
where
there
was
money
i
would
not
kill
it
would
be
as
you
have
said
there
are
other
ways
but
jean
le
roi
is
different
jean
le
roi
as
you
call
him
must
be
tamed
then
hurd
said
you
speak
of
money
i
have
been
her
agent
so
i
can
tell
you
what
do
you
think
might
be
the
income
of
this
lady
johnson
was
deeply
interested
he
leaned
across
the
table
his
little
black
eyes
were
alight
with
cupidity
who
can
tell
he
murmured
it
might
be
two
perhaps
three
four
thousand
english
pounds
a
year
eh
stephen
hurd
laughed
scornfully
four
thousand
a
year
he
repeated
bah
she
fooled
you
all
to
some
purpose
her
income
is
listen
is
forty
thousand
pounds
a
year
you
hear
that
my
friend
forty
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
little
man
face
was
a
study
in
varying
expressions
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
then
crouched
forward
over
the
table
his
beady
eyes
were
almost
protruding
a
spot
of
deeper
colour
an
ugly
purple
patch
burned
upon
his
cheeks
the
words
seemed
frozen
upon
his
lips
twice
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
said
nothing
stephen
hurd
took
off
his
hat
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
before
him
his
listener
emotion
was
catching
forty
thousand
pounds
he
said
softly
livres
you
call
it
it
is
a
great
fortune
she
has
deceived
you
too
you
must
make
her
pay
for
it
johnson
was
recovering
himself
slowly
his
voice
when
he
spoke
shook
but
it
was
with
the
dawn
of
a
vicious
anger
yes
he
muttered
speaking
as
though
to
himself
she
has
deceived
us
she
must
pay
god
how
she
must
pay
his
fingers
twitched
upon
the
table
he
was
blinking
rapidly
there
is
the
money
he
said
softly
and
there
is
jean
le
roi
it
was
a
night
of
shocks
for
him
again
his
eyes
were
dilated
he
shrank
back
in
his
chair
and
clutched
at
hurd
sleeve
it
is
himself
he
whispered
hoarsely
it
is
jean
le
roi
god
in
heaven
he
will
kill
us
johnson
collapsed
for
a
moment
in
his
face
were
all
the
evidences
of
an
abject
fear
and
stephen
hurd
was
in
very
nearly
as
evil
a
plight
the
man
who
was
threading
his
way
through
the
tables
towards
them
was
alarming
enough
in
his
appearance
and
expression
to
have
cowed
braver
men
jean
le
roi
he
fears
nothing
he
cares
for
nothing
not
even
for
me
his
father
johnson
muttered
with
chattering
teeth
if
he
feels
like
it
he
will
kill
us
as
we
sit
here
hurd
who
was
facing
the
man
watched
him
with
fascinated
eyes
he
was
over
six
feet
high
and
magnificently
formed
notwithstanding
his
ready
made
clothes
fresh
from
a
french
tailor
his
brown
hat
ludicrously
too
small
and
the
blue
stubble
of
a
recently
cropped
beard
he
was
almost
as
impressively
handsome
as
he
was
repulsive
to
look
at
he
walked
with
the
grace
of
a
savage
animal
in
his
native
woods
there
was
something
indeed
not
altogether
human
in
the
gleam
of
his
white
teeth
and
stealthy
faultless
movements
he
came
straight
to
where
they
sat
and
his
hand
fell
like
a
vice
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
shrinking
elder
man
it
was
further
characteristic
of
this
strange
being
that
when
he
spoke
there
was
no
anger
in
his
tone
his
voice
indeed
was
scarcely
raised
above
a
whisper
what
are
you
doing
here
old
man
he
asked
why
did
you
not
meet
me
eh
i
will
tell
you
tell
you
everything
jean
johnson
answered
sit
down
here
and
drink
with
us
everything
shall
be
made
quite
clear
to
you
i
came
for
your
sake
to
get
money
jean
sit
down
my
boy
jean
le
roi
sat
down
i
sit
with
you
he
said
and
i
will
drink
with
you
because
i
have
no
money
to
pay
for
myself
but
we
are
not
friends
yet
old
man
i
will
hear
first
what
you
have
done
and
who
is
this
his
eyes
flashed
as
he
looked
upon
hurd
johnson
interposed
quickly
a
friend
a
good
friend
he
exclaimed
he
will
be
of
service
to
us
great
service
only
a
few
minutes
ago
he
told
me
something
astounding
something
for
you
also
to
hear
dear
jean
it
is
wonderful
news
jean
le
roi
interrupted
what
i
want
to
hear
from
you
he
said
in
a
soft
vicious
whisper
is
why
when
they
let
me
out
of
that
cursed
place
you
were
not
there
with
money
and
clothes
for
me
as
i
ordered
but
for
the
poor
faithful
annette
whom
i
did
not
desire
to
see
i
might
have
starved
on
the
day
of
my
release
stop
he
held
up
his
hand
as
johnson
was
on
the
point
of
pouring
out
a
copious
explanation
order
me
brandy
first
tell
them
to
bring
me
the
bottle
do
not
speak
till
i
have
drunk
they
called
a
waiter
and
gave
the
order
they
waited
in
an
uneasy
silence
until
it
arrived
jean
le
roi
drank
at
first
sparingly
but
his
eyes
rested
lovingly
upon
the
bottle
now
speak
he
commanded
johnson
told
his
story
with
appropriate
gestures
after
it
was
all
over
he
began
rapidly
and
one
saw
that
a
rescue
was
impossible
i
followed
madame
it
was
a
moment
of
fury
i
thought
she
will
repent
she
will
pay
for
lawyers
for
his
defence
so
i
hung
about
her
hotel
only
to
find
that
she
had
left
stolen
away
as
you
know
she
did
not
appear
at
the
trial
it
was
a
bargain
with
the
police
that
they
should
not
call
her
if
she
betrayed
you
she
escaped
me
jean
and
as
you
know
i
had
no
money
all
every
penny
had
been
spent
on
your
clothes
and
your
horse
and
carriage
to
make
you
a
gentleman
jean
le
roi
extended
his
hands
money
well
spent
indeed
let
the
old
man
continue
she
escaped
me
jean
and
it
was
many
months
before
i
found
a
clue
on
an
old
label
just
the
words
england
so
i
wrote
there
and
the
letter
did
not
come
back
as
the
others
i
waited
a
little
time
and
i
wrote
again
this
time
to
receive
an
answer
it
was
a
stern
angry
letter
from
a
man
who
called
himself
her
father
and
signed
himself
stephen
hurd
he
was
what
is
called
here
an
estate
agent
and
he
had
not
very
much
money
he
would
not
send
one
pound
he
said
that
the
marriage
was
illegal
and
if
one
came
to
england
he
threatened
the
law
i
wrote
again
humbly
piteously
i
spoke
of
your
hardships
i
told
how
all
the
time
you
raved
of
your
dear
wife
how
you
repented
your
madness
how
it
was
for
love
of
her
only
that
you
had
committed
such
a
crime
there
came
no
answer
i
forwarded
the
letters
which
you
had
written
to
her
i
begged
oh
how
i
begged
for
just
a
little
money
for
the
small
luxuries
the
good
wine
the
tobacco
the
newspapers
they
sent
nothing
jean
le
roi
drew
in
his
breath
with
a
gasp
oh
he
muttered
so
they
sent
nothing
not
one
sou
jean
not
one
sou
and
all
the
while
the
time
of
your
release
was
drawing
near
what
could
i
do
well
i
raised
the
money
how
i
will
not
tell
you
my
boy
but
i
went
on
a
fruit
boat
from
havre
to
southampton
and
from
there
down
to
thorpe
i
saw
the
old
man
stephen
hurd
it
was
on
a
sunday
night
that
i
arrived
and
i
found
him
alone
he
was
as
hard
jean
as
his
letters
when
i
pressed
him
he
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
i
would
not
go
i
said
that
i
would
see
my
i
would
remain
until
i
saw
her
i
said
even
if
i
slept
under
a
hedge
again
he
ordered
me
out
of
the
house
i
was
firm
i
refused
then
he
struck
me
there
was
a
quarrel
and
he
fell
i
thought
at
first
that
he
was
unconscious
but
when
i
examined
him
he
was
dead
johnson
finished
his
speech
in
a
stealthy
whisper
leaning
half
way
across
the
table
jean
le
roi
poured
himself
out
more
brandy
but
he
was
unmoved
the
old
trick
i
suppose
he
remarked
carelessly
making
a
swift
movement
with
his
hand
no
no
johnson
declared
earnestly
i
used
no
weapon
it
was
an
accident
a
pure
accident
remember
that
this
is
his
son
he
would
not
be
here
if
it
was
not
quite
certain
that
it
was
accident
and
accident
alone
jean
le
roi
lifted
his
head
and
gazed
curiously
at
stephen
hurd
so
you
he
murmured
are
my
johnson
leaned
once
more
across
the
table
it
is
where
you
where
we
all
have
been
deceived
he
said
impressively
listen
she
was
never
the
daughter
of
stephen
hurd
at
all
it
was
a
schoolgirl
freak
to
take
that
name
when
she
was
eluding
her
chaperon
and
amusing
herself
in
paris
stephen
hurd
was
her
servant
and
she
jean
le
roi
asked
softly
johnson
spread
out
his
fingers
his
voice
trembled
his
eyes
shone
it
was
like
speaking
of
something
holy
she
is
a
great
lady
he
said
she
goes
to
court
she
has
houses
and
horses
and
carriages
troops
of
servants
a
yacht
she
is
rich
fabulously
rich
jean
she
has
listen
forty
thousand
pounds
livres
mind
a
year
more
than
that
hurd
muttered
more
than
that
johnson
repeated
jean
le
roi
was
no
longer
unmoved
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
his
teeth
seemed
to
come
together
with
a
click
there
is
no
mistake
he
asked
softly
an
income
of
forty
thousand
pounds
there
is
no
mistake
stephen
hurd
assured
him
i
will
answer
for
that
jean
le
roi
face
was
white
and
vicious
yet
for
a
time
he
said
nothing
and
his
two
companions
watched
him
anxiously
there
was
something
uncanny
about
his
silence
it
is
a
great
deal
of
money
he
said
at
last
often
in
prison
i
was
hungry
i
had
no
cigarettes
i
was
forced
to
drink
water
a
great
deal
of
money
and
she
is
my
wife
half
of
what
she
has
belongs
to
me
that
is
the
law
eh
i
do
know
about
that
stephen
hurd
said
but
she
has
certainly
treated
you
very
badly
jean
le
roi
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
not
violently
and
yet
somehow
with
a
force
which
made
itself
felt
it
is
over
that
he
said
i
am
a
man
who
knows
when
he
has
been
who
knows
too
what
it
is
that
a
wife
owes
to
her
husband
tell
me
where
it
is
that
she
lives
old
man
write
it
down
johnson
drew
from
his
pocket
a
stump
of
pencil
and
the
back
of
an
envelope
he
wrote
slowly
and
with
care
jean
le
roi
extended
the
palm
of
his
hand
to
stephen
hurd
he
will
warn
madame
perhaps
he
suggested
why
does
he
sit
here
with
us
this
young
man
is
it
that
he
too
wants
money
no
no
my
son
johnson
intervened
hastily
madame
treated
him
badly
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
see
her
humiliated
jean
le
roi
smiled
it
shall
be
done
he
promised
but
from
one
of
you
i
must
have
money
i
can
not
present
myself
before
my
wife
so
altered
no
one
would
believe
my
story
how
much
do
you
want
hurd
asked
uneasily
twenty
pounds
english
jean
le
roi
answered
i
can
not
resume
my
appearance
as
a
gentleman
on
less
hurd
took
out
some
notes
i
will
lend
you
that
he
said
slowly
jean
le
roi
long
fingers
took
firm
hold
of
the
notes
he
buttoned
them
up
in
his
pocket
slapped
the
place
where
they
were
and
poured
out
more
brandy
now
he
said
i
am
prepared
madame
shall
discover
what
it
means
to
deceive
her
fond
husband
hurd
moved
in
his
seat
uneasily
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
villainous
curve
of
the
man
lips
in
the
utter
absence
of
any
direct
threats
what
was
it
that
was
passing
in
his
mind
you
are
not
thinking
of
any
violence
he
asked
remember
she
is
a
proud
woman
and
you
can
not
punish
her
more
than
by
simply
appearing
and
declaring
yourself
jean
le
roi
smiled
we
shall
see
he
declared
chapter
xiii
the
king
of
the
apaches
wilhelmina
was
resting
and
looked
in
need
of
it
all
the
delicate
colours
and
fluttering
ribbons
of
her
doucet
could
not
hide
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
or
the
hollows
under
her
eyes
macheson
who
came
in
sternly
enough
felt
himself
moved
to
a
troublous
pity
nothing
seemed
left
of
the
great
lady
or
the
poseuse
you
are
kind
she
murmured
to
come
so
soon
sit
down
please
is
there
any
trouble
he
asked
you
look
worried
she
laughed
unnaturally
no
wonder
she
answered
for
five
years
i
have
been
living
more
or
less
on
the
brink
of
a
volcano
from
what
i
have
heard
i
fancy
that
an
eruption
is
about
due
tell
me
about
it
he
asked
she
passed
him
a
telegram
it
was
from
paris
and
it
was
signed
gilbert
deyes
jean
le
roi
was
free
yesterday
left
immediately
for
england
macheson
looked
up
he
did
not
understand
and
who
he
asked
is
jean
le
roi
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
my
husband
she
told
him
quietly
at
least
that
is
what
i
suppose
the
law
would
say
that
he
was
macheson
had
been
prepared
for
something
surprising
but
not
for
this
he
looked
at
her
incredulously
he
found
himself
aimlessly
repeating
her
words
your
husband
i
was
married
five
years
ago
in
paris
she
said
in
a
dull
emotionless
tone
no
one
over
here
knows
about
it
or
has
seen
him
because
he
has
been
in
prison
all
the
time
it
was
i
who
sent
him
there
i
ca
believe
this
he
said
in
a
low
tone
it
is
too
amazing
then
a
light
broke
in
upon
him
and
he
began
to
understand
he
is
in
england
now
she
said
and
i
am
afraid
jean
le
roi
he
muttered
king
of
the
apaches
she
answered
bitterly
greatest
rogue
in
paris
they
said
when
they
sentenced
him
sentenced
him
he
repeated
bewildered
he
has
been
in
prison
since
the
day
we
were
married
she
continued
it
was
i
who
sent
him
there
he
bowed
his
head
he
felt
that
it
was
not
right
to
look
at
her
an
infinite
wave
of
tenderness
swept
through
his
whole
being
he
was
ashamed
of
his
past
thoughts
of
her
of
his
hasty
judgments
all
the
time
she
had
been
carrying
this
in
her
bosom
her
very
pride
seemed
to
him
now
magnificent
he
felt
suddenly
like
a
querulous
child
what
can
i
do
to
help
you
he
asked
softly
she
came
a
little
nearer
to
him
i
am
afraid
she
said
dropping
her
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
ever
since
i
heard
the
story
of
his
life
as
it
was
told
in
court
i
have
been
afraid
when
he
was
taken
he
swore
to
be
revenged
for
the
last
hours
i
have
felt
somehow
that
he
was
near
read
this
she
passed
him
a
letter
the
notepaper
was
thick
and
expensive
and
headed
by
a
small
coronet
my
dearest
wife
it
began
at
last
this
miserable
separation
comes
to
an
end
i
am
here
in
london
on
my
way
to
you
prepare
to
throw
yourself
into
my
arms
how
much
too
long
has
our
happiness
been
deferred
i
should
have
been
with
you
before
dear
wilhelmina
but
for
more
sordid
considerations
i
need
money
i
need
money
very
badly
send
me
please
a
thousand
pounds
between
three
and
four
or
shall
i
come
and
fetch
it
and
you
as
you
will
your
devoted
husband
jean
he
gave
her
back
the
letter
gravely
what
was
your
answer
he
asked
i
sent
nothing
she
declared
i
did
not
reply
but
i
am
afraid
horribly
afraid
he
is
a
terrible
man
if
we
were
alone
he
would
kill
me
as
you
or
i
would
a
fly
if
only
they
could
have
proved
the
things
at
the
trial
which
were
known
to
be
true
he
would
never
have
seen
the
daylight
again
but
even
the
witnesses
were
terrified
they
dared
not
give
evidence
against
him
will
you
tell
me
macheson
asked
how
it
all
came
about
not
unless
you
like
he
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
not
if
it
is
painful
to
you
she
sat
down
upon
the
couch
curling
herself
up
at
the
further
end
of
it
and
building
up
the
pillows
at
the
further
end
to
support
her
head
against
the
soft
green
silk
her
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
tired
child
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
her
she
was
no
longer
playing
a
part
not
even
to
him
not
even
to
herself
there
was
nothing
left
of
the
woman
of
the
world
it
was
the
child
who
told
him
her
story
you
must
listen
she
said
and
you
may
laugh
at
me
if
you
like
but
you
must
not
be
angry
my
story
is
the
story
of
a
fool
sit
down
please
at
the
end
of
the
couch
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
have
you
between
me
and
the
door
he
obeyed
her
in
silence
and
she
continued
she
spoke
like
a
child
repeating
her
lesson
she
held
a
lace
handkerchief
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
large
and
intent
never
left
his
this
is
the
story
of
a
girl
she
said
an
orphan
who
went
abroad
with
a
chaperon
to
travel
in
europe
and
perfect
her
french
in
paris
the
chaperon
fell
ill
the
girl
hired
a
guide
recommended
by
the
hotel
to
show
her
the
sights
they
saw
all
that
the
tourist
sees
and
the
chaperon
was
still
ill
the
girl
thought
that
she
would
like
to
see
something
of
the
parisians
themselves
she
was
tired
of
cook
english
people
and
americans
so
she
gave
the
guide
money
to
buy
himself
clothes
and
bade
him
take
her
to
the
restaurants
and
places
where
the
world
of
paris
assembled
it
was
known
at
the
hotel
perhaps
through
the
servants
that
the
girl
was
rich
the
guide
heard
it
and
told
some
one
else
between
them
they
concocted
a
plot
the
girl
was
to
be
the
victim
she
was
only
eighteen
one
day
they
were
lunching
at
the
café
de
paris
the
guide
and
the
girl
when
a
young
man
entered
he
was
exceedingly
handsome
and
very
wonderfully
turned
out
after
the
fashion
of
the
french
dandy
the
guide
as
the
young
man
passed
rose
up
and
bowed
respectfully
the
young
man
nodded
carelessly
then
he
saw
the
girl
and
he
looked
at
her
as
no
man
had
ever
looked
before
and
the
girl
ought
to
have
been
angry
but
was
she
asked
the
guide
who
the
young
man
was
he
told
her
that
it
was
the
duke
of
languerois
head
of
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
france
his
father
and
grandfather
and
for
a
time
he
himself
had
been
in
their
service
the
girl
looked
across
at
the
young
man
with
interest
and
the
young
man
returned
her
gaze
that
was
what
he
was
there
for
as
they
left
the
restaurant
her
guide
fell
behind
for
a
moment
and
when
she
looked
round
she
saw
him
talking
to
the
young
man
of
course
she
wanted
to
know
what
they
had
been
saying
and
with
much
apparent
reluctance
the
guide
told
her
the
young
man
had
been
inquiring
about
mademoiselle
where
they
spent
their
time
how
he
could
meet
them
of
course
he
had
told
nothing
but
the
young
man
was
very
persistent
and
very
much
in
earnest
she
encouraged
the
guide
to
talk
about
him
and
she
believed
what
she
was
told
he
was
rich
noble
adored
in
french
society
and
he
was
in
love
with
mademoiselle
she
was
very
soon
given
to
understand
this
for
several
days
the
young
man
was
always
in
evidence
he
was
perfectly
respectful
he
never
attempted
to
address
her
it
was
all
most
cunningly
planned
then
one
evening
when
she
was
driving
with
her
guide
through
a
narrow
street
a
man
sprang
suddenly
upon
the
step
of
her
carriage
and
snatched
at
her
jewels
another
on
the
other
side
had
passed
his
arm
round
the
guide
neck
and
almost
throttled
him
and
a
third
was
struggling
with
the
coachman
it
was
one
of
those
attacks
by
apaches
which
were
common
enough
then
at
least
it
seemed
like
one
the
girl
screamed
and
of
course
the
young
man
who
had
been
following
in
another
voiture
appeared
one
of
the
thieves
he
threw
on
to
the
pavement
the
others
fled
and
the
young
man
was
a
hero
it
was
well
arranged
her
voice
broke
for
a
moment
and
macheson
moved
uneasily
upon
the
sofa
if
he
could
he
would
have
stopped
her
he
could
guess
as
much
of
the
miserable
story
as
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
but
she
ignored
his
threatened
interruption
she
was
determined
having
kept
her
secret
for
so
long
that
he
should
know
now
the
whole
truth
after
that
things
moved
rapidly
the
girl
was
as
near
her
own
mistress
as
a
child
of
her
age
could
be
she
was
lonely
and
the
young
man
proved
a
delightful
companion
he
had
many
attractive
gifts
and
he
knew
how
to
make
use
of
them
all
the
time
he
made
love
to
her
for
a
time
she
resisted
but
she
had
very
little
chance
she
was
just
at
the
age
when
all
girls
are
more
or
less
fools
in
the
end
she
consented
to
a
secret
marriage
afterwards
he
was
to
take
her
to
his
family
but
that
time
never
came
they
were
married
at
eleven
one
morning
and
went
afterwards
to
a
café
for
déjeûner
the
young
man
that
day
was
ill
at
ease
and
nervous
he
kept
looking
about
him
as
though
he
was
afraid
of
being
followed
he
spoke
vaguely
of
danger
from
the
anger
of
his
noble
relations
they
were
scarcely
seated
at
luncheon
before
a
man
came
quietly
into
the
place
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
whatever
those
few
words
were
the
young
man
went
suddenly
pale
and
called
for
his
hat
and
stick
he
wrote
an
address
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
gave
it
to
the
girl
he
begged
her
to
follow
him
in
an
hour
he
would
introduce
her
then
to
his
friends
and
he
left
her
alone
the
girl
was
troubled
and
uneasy
he
had
gone
off
without
even
paying
for
the
luncheon
he
had
the
air
of
a
desperate
man
she
began
to
realize
what
she
had
done
she
was
preparing
to
depart
when
an
englishman
who
had
been
lunching
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
came
over
and
with
a
word
of
apology
sat
down
by
her
side
he
saw
that
she
was
young
and
a
and
he
told
her
very
gravely
that
he
was
sure
she
could
not
be
aware
of
the
character
of
the
man
with
whom
she
had
been
lunching
her
eyes
grew
wide
open
with
horror
the
man
he
said
was
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
french
nobleman
and
his
mother
had
been
married
to
a
guide
her
guide
he
had
perhaps
the
worst
character
of
any
man
in
paris
he
had
been
tried
for
murder
imprisoned
for
forgery
and
he
was
now
suspected
of
being
the
leader
of
a
band
of
desperate
criminals
who
were
dreaded
all
over
paris
this
and
other
things
he
told
her
of
the
man
whom
she
had
just
married
the
girl
listened
as
though
turned
to
stone
with
the
piece
of
paper
which
he
had
given
her
crumpled
up
in
her
hands
then
the
police
came
they
asked
her
questions
she
pretended
at
first
to
know
nothing
at
last
she
addressed
the
commissionary
if
she
gave
him
the
address
where
this
young
man
could
be
found
he
and
all
his
friends
might
she
depart
without
mention
being
made
of
her
or
her
name
appearing
in
any
way
the
commissionary
agreed
and
she
gave
him
the
piece
of
paper
the
englishman
it
was
gilbert
deyes
took
her
back
to
her
hotel
and
the
police
captured
jean
le
roi
and
the
whole
band
of
his
associates
the
girl
returned
to
england
that
night
jean
le
roi
was
sentenced
to
six
years
penal
servitude
his
time
was
up
last
week
what
a
diabolical
plot
macheson
exclaimed
but
the
marriage
it
could
have
been
annulled
surely
perhaps
she
answered
but
i
did
not
dare
to
face
the
publicity
i
felt
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
again
i
had
given
my
name
to
the
guide
johnson
as
clara
hurd
i
hoped
that
they
might
never
find
me
they
can
not
do
you
any
harm
macheson
declared
let
me
go
with
you
to
the
lawyers
they
will
see
that
you
are
not
molested
she
shook
her
head
it
is
not
so
easy
she
said
the
marriage
was
quite
legal
to
have
it
annulled
i
should
have
to
enter
a
suit
the
whole
story
would
come
out
i
could
never
live
in
england
afterwards
but
you
do
mean
he
protested
to
remain
bound
to
this
blackguard
all
your
life
how
can
i
free
myself
she
asked
except
by
making
myself
the
of
the
country
why
did
you
send
for
me
he
asked
bluntly
to
ask
for
your
advice
and
to
protect
me
she
added
with
a
shiver
it
is
not
only
money
that
jean
le
roi
wants
it
is
vengeance
because
i
betrayed
him
as
for
that
i
wo
leave
you
except
when
you
send
me
away
he
declared
and
my
advice
if
you
want
that
the
right
thing
to
me
seems
simple
enough
go
at
once
to
your
lawyers
they
will
tell
you
the
proper
course
at
the
worst
the
man
could
be
bought
off
for
the
present
she
raised
her
head
i
will
not
give
him
one
penny
she
declared
i
have
always
sworn
that
but
i
afraid
if
you
wo
try
to
divorce
him
that
he
can
claim
some
macheson
said
then
he
must
come
and
take
it
by
force
she
declared
there
was
silence
between
them
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
came
and
stood
before
him
i
ought
to
have
told
you
all
this
long
ago
she
said
simply
i
felt
that
i
must
tell
you
without
another
hour
delay
now
that
you
know
i
am
not
so
terrified
but
you
must
promise
to
come
and
see
me
every
day
while
that
brute
remains
in
london
yes
i
promise
that
he
answered
also
rising
to
his
feet
they
heard
her
maid
moving
about
in
the
bedroom
hortense
is
reminding
me
that
i
must
dress
for
dinner
she
remarked
with
a
faint
smile
one
must
dine
you
know
even
in
the
midst
of
tragedies
macheson
prepared
to
take
his
departure
i
shall
come
he
said
if
you
do
not
send
for
me
before
chapter
xiv
behind
the
palm
trees
lady
peggy
was
fussing
round
the
talking
to
all
her
guests
at
once
i
have
the
least
idea
who
takes
anybody
in
she
declared
james
said
he
see
to
that
so
you
might
just
as
well
put
your
hand
in
a
and
i
not
at
all
sure
that
you
get
any
dinner
i
got
a
new
drives
up
in
a
high
dogcart
with
such
a
sweet
little
groom
he
may
be
all
right
jules
the
maître
at
claridge
got
him
for
me
and
wilhelmina
sooner
than
come
out
like
a
ghost
really
take
lessons
in
the
use
of
the
my
new
maid
a
perfect
treasure
at
it
no
one
can
ever
tell
whether
my
colour
natural
or
not
i
do
mind
telling
you
people
it
generally
is
but
anyhow
it
daubed
on
like
lady
sydney
makes
her
look
for
all
the
world
like
one
of
dames
does
it
i
sure
i
be
afraid
to
be
seen
speaking
to
her
if
i
were
a
man
gilbert
she
broke
off
addressing
deyes
who
was
just
being
ushered
in
how
dare
you
come
to
dinner
without
being
asked
i
sure
i
have
not
asked
you
do
say
i
did
now
you
refused
me
eight
times
running
and
i
crossed
you
off
my
list
deyes
held
out
a
card
as
he
bowed
over
his
hostess
fingers
my
dear
lady
he
said
here
is
the
proof
that
i
am
not
an
intruder
i
am
down
to
take
in
our
hostess
of
thorpe
you
have
bribed
james
she
declared
i
hope
it
cost
you
a
great
deal
of
money
i
will
not
believe
that
i
asked
you
however
since
you
are
here
go
and
tell
wilhelmina
some
of
your
stories
i
hate
pale
cheeks
and
wilhelmina
blushes
easily
no
use
looking
at
the
clock
duke
dinner
will
be
at
least
half
an
hour
late
i
sure
these
foreign
have
no
idea
of
punctuality
what
that
dinner
served
two
minutes
before
time
well
we
all
here
are
we
i
knew
it
would
be
either
too
early
or
too
late
duke
you
will
have
to
take
me
in
by
the
time
we
get
there
the
soup
will
probably
be
cold
you
better
pray
that
starting
with
caviare
and
oysters
such
a
slow
crowd
are
they
and
such
chatterboxes
i
wish
they
move
on
a
little
faster
and
talk
a
little
less
no
only
thirty
nice
sociable
number
i
call
it
for
a
round
table
i
asked
victor
macheson
the
man
who
so
rude
to
us
all
every
thursday
afternoon
for
a
guinea
a
time
i
do
know
why
we
pay
it
to
be
abused
but
he
would
come
i
met
him
before
he
developed
and
i
do
think
he
liked
me
you
got
my
telegram
deyes
asked
as
he
unfolded
his
napkin
wilhelmina
nodded
yes
she
answered
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
warn
me
i
have
had
a
letter
already
the
campaign
has
begun
deyes
nodded
chosen
your
weapons
yet
he
asked
i
have
much
choice
have
i
she
answered
a
little
bitterly
i
fight
of
course
deyes
was
carefully
scanning
the
menu
through
his
eyeglass
becassine
à
la
broche
he
murmured
i
must
remember
that
then
he
turned
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
wilhelmina
you
are
worrying
he
declared
abruptly
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
alabaster
white
rising
from
the
unrelieved
black
of
her
velvet
gown
my
maid
fault
she
added
i
ought
to
have
worn
white
of
course
worrying
i
do
care
about
carrying
the
signs
of
it
about
with
me
though
i
think
i
shall
have
to
adopt
peggy
advice
and
go
to
the
perhaps
he
said
deliberately
it
will
not
be
necessary
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
his
words
sounded
encouraging
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
a
way
may
be
found
to
induce
a
certain
gentleman
to
return
to
his
native
country
and
stay
there
deyes
said
smoothly
after
dinner
we
are
going
to
have
some
talk
please
oblige
me
now
by
abandoning
the
discussion
and
eating
something
ah
that
champagne
will
do
you
good
her
neighbour
on
the
other
side
addressed
her
and
wilhelmina
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
lightening
of
the
load
upon
her
heart
like
every
one
else
she
had
confidence
in
this
tall
man
whose
life
was
somewhat
of
a
mystery
even
to
his
friends
and
who
had
about
him
that
suggestion
of
power
which
reticence
nearly
always
brings
he
was
going
to
help
her
she
pushed
all
those
miserable
thoughts
away
from
her
she
became
herself
again
let
no
one
imagine
lady
peggy
said
carefully
knocking
the
end
of
a
cigarette
upon
the
table
that
i
am
going
to
try
to
catch
the
eyes
of
all
you
women
and
go
sailing
away
with
my
nose
in
the
air
to
look
at
engravings
in
the
you
can
just
get
up
and
go
when
you
like
any
or
all
of
you
there
are
bridge
tables
laid
out
for
you
in
the
library
music
and
a
hopping
girl
i
do
call
it
dancing
in
the
a
pool
in
the
or
flirtation
in
the
coffee
and
liqueurs
will
follow
you
wherever
you
go
take
your
choice
good
people
for
myself
the
duke
is
telling
me
stories
of
cairo
suis
reste
i
only
thankful
no
one
else
can
hear
them
the
party
at
the
great
round
table
dispersed
slowly
by
two
and
threes
wilhelmina
and
deyes
strolled
into
the
deyes
lit
a
cigarette
and
stood
with
his
hands
behind
him
wilhelmina
was
leaning
against
the
back
of
a
chair
she
was
too
excited
to
sit
down
please
she
begged
deyes
threw
his
cigarette
away
his
face
seemed
to
harden
and
soften
at
the
same
time
his
mouth
was
suddenly
firm
but
his
eyes
glowed
all
the
boredom
was
gone
from
his
manner
and
expression
wilhelmina
he
said
i
have
wanted
to
marry
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
in
the
café
de
paris
with
that
atrocious
blackguard
who
has
caused
you
so
much
suffering
you
may
remember
that
i
have
hinted
as
much
to
you
before
she
was
startled
visibly
disturbed
you
know
very
well
she
said
that
you
are
speaking
of
impossible
things
things
that
were
impossible
wilhelmina
he
said
suppose
i
take
jean
le
roi
off
your
hands
suppose
i
promise
to
send
him
back
to
his
own
country
like
a
rat
to
his
hole
suppose
i
promise
that
your
marriage
shall
be
annulled
without
a
line
in
the
newspapers
without
a
single
vestige
of
publicity
you
can
not
do
it
she
murmured
eagerly
you
want
your
freedom
then
he
asked
yes
i
want
my
freedom
she
answered
i
have
a
right
to
it
i
and
i
he
said
slowly
want
you
there
was
a
short
pause
through
the
palms
came
the
faint
wailing
of
a
violin
the
crash
of
pianoforte
chords
the
clear
soft
notes
of
a
singer
wilhelmina
felt
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
she
was
overwrought
and
there
were
new
things
things
that
were
strange
to
her
in
the
worn
lined
face
of
the
man
who
was
bending
towards
her
wilhelmina
he
said
softly
life
our
life
does
its
best
to
strangle
the
emotions
one
feels
that
one
does
best
with
a
pulse
which
has
forgotten
how
to
quicken
and
a
heart
which
beats
to
the
will
of
its
owner
but
the
most
hardened
of
us
come
to
grief
sometimes
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
come
very
much
to
grief
i
am
sorry
she
said
quietly
he
drew
away
and
his
face
became
like
marble
you
mean
that
it
is
any
use
he
asked
hoarsely
she
looked
at
him
and
he
did
not
press
for
words
is
it
the
missioner
he
asked
her
head
sank
a
little
lower
but
still
she
did
not
answer
gilbert
deyes
drew
himself
upright
he
remembered
the
cigarette
which
had
burnt
itself
out
between
his
fingers
and
he
carefully
it
i
am
now
he
said
blowing
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
into
the
heart
of
a
yellow
rose
confronted
by
a
somewhat
hackneyed
but
always
interesting
problem
do
i
care
for
you
enough
or
too
little
or
too
much
to
continue
your
friend
when
my
aid
will
probably
ensure
the
loss
of
you
for
ever
it
is
not
a
problem
to
be
hurried
over
this
there
is
no
need
for
haste
she
answered
i
know
you
gilbert
better
than
you
know
yourself
i
am
very
sure
that
you
will
help
me
if
you
can
he
laughed
bitterly
you
are
a
good
deal
surer
of
me
than
i
am
of
myself
he
answered
why
should
i
give
you
up
to
a
boy
who
has
learnt
yet
the
first
lesson
of
life
what
is
it
she
asked
i
am
not
clear
that
i
have
graduated
you
can
see
it
blazoned
over
the
portals
as
you
pass
through
the
gates
he
answered
all
enthusiasm
ye
who
enter
here
the
pathways
of
life
are
heaped
with
the
corpses
of
those
who
will
not
understand
do
you
think
that
this
boy
will
fare
better
than
the
rest
with
his
preaching
and
lectures
and
east
end
work
it
sheer
impertinence
man
the
individual
is
only
a
pawn
in
the
game
of
life
why
should
he
imagine
that
he
can
alter
the
things
that
are
even
the
striving
to
alter
them
she
said
may
tend
towards
betterment
a
platitude
he
declared
and
hopeless
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
anyhow
she
said
softly
i
care
for
him
he
bowed
low
incomprehensible
he
murmured
take
your
freedom
and
marry
this
young
man
if
you
must
but
i
warn
you
that
you
will
be
miserable
apples
and
green
figs
do
grow
on
the
same
tree
he
drew
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
jean
le
roi
he
said
was
married
to
annette
hurier
in
the
town
of
châlons
two
years
before
he
posed
before
you
as
the
duke
of
languerois
you
will
find
annette
address
in
there
it
took
me
a
year
to
trace
this
out
a
wasted
year
bah
you
women
are
all
disappointments
we
will
go
and
play
bridge
lady
peggy
stared
at
wilhelmina
when
they
entered
the
library
a
few
minutes
later
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
to
her
gilbert
she
demanded
she
a
changed
woman
making
love
to
her
deyes
answered
lady
peggy
laughed
if
i
believed
you
she
declared
i
give
up
this
rubber
and
go
and
lose
myself
amongst
the
palms
with
you
come
and
cut
in
you
too
wilhelmina
but
wilhelmina
excused
herself
she
drove
homewards
with
a
soft
smile
upon
her
lips
and
the
dead
weight
lifted
from
her
heart
chapter
xv
the
only
way
it
was
a
round
table
too
at
which
macheson
dined
that
night
but
with
a
different
company
for
they
were
all
men
who
sat
there
men
with
earnest
faces
and
thoughtful
eyes
the
graces
of
evening
dress
and
society
talk
they
knew
nothing
of
they
were
the
friends
of
college
days
the
men
who
had
sworn
amongst
themselves
that
however
they
might
live
they
would
devote
the
greater
part
of
their
life
to
their
they
were
smoking
pipes
and
a
great
bowl
of
tobacco
was
on
the
table
few
of
them
took
wine
but
macheson
and
holderness
were
drinking
whisky
holderness
their
senior
was
usually
the
one
who
started
their
informal
talk
my
work
been
easy
enough
all
the
time
he
remarked
leaning
forward
there
were
no
end
of
but
all
being
run
either
for
the
trades
unions
or
some
special
industrial
branch
i
started
a
labour
magazine
macheson
found
the
money
of
course
and
i
paying
my
way
now
i
do
know
whether
the
thing
does
any
good
at
any
rate
it
an
effort
i
been
hearing
about
your
colony
franklin
i
shall
want
an
article
on
it
presently
a
tall
thin
young
man
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
you
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
i
can
find
time
he
answered
going
strong
but
really
there
very
little
credit
due
to
me
it
was
macheson
money
and
macheson
idea
we
got
an
entire
village
now
near
llandirog
and
the
whole
population
come
from
the
prisons
macheson
and
i
used
to
attend
the
ourselves
hear
all
the
cases
and
form
our
own
conclusions
as
to
the
prisoners
if
we
thought
there
was
any
hope
for
them
we
made
a
note
met
them
when
they
came
out
and
offered
them
a
job
on
probation
in
our
village
we
have
to
leave
it
to
the
chaplains
now
i
ca
spare
time
to
be
always
in
london
we
two
woollen
mills
a
and
a
bakery
besides
all
the
shops
and
nearly
a
thousand
acres
of
land
at
first
the
people
round
were
terribly
shy
of
us
but
that
all
over
now
why
we
have
less
trouble
with
the
police
in
our
village
than
any
for
miles
around
paying
our
way
too
you
done
thundering
well
franklin
macheson
declared
i
remember
what
a
rough
time
you
had
at
first
uphill
work
was
it
that
what
makes
it
such
a
relief
to
have
pulled
through
franklin
declared
his
pipe
i
should
like
to
say
how
much
i
had
to
draw
from
macheson
before
we
turned
the
corner
glad
to
say
paid
a
bit
back
now
though
tell
us
about
your
idea
holroyd
they
tell
me
it
working
well
in
some
of
the
large
cities
it
simple
enough
holroyd
answered
smiling
it
was
just
the
application
of
common
sense
to
the
laws
of
charity
nearly
every
charitable
by
instinct
only
sometimes
it
so
difficult
for
a
busy
man
to
know
exactly
when
and
how
to
give
i
started
in
one
of
the
big
cities
looking
up
prosperous
families
i
try
to
induce
them
instead
of
just
writing
cheques
for
institutions
and
making
things
for
bazaars
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
a
family
of
about
the
same
size
as
their
own
who
were
in
a
bad
way
when
they
promised
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
find
the
poor
family
and
bring
them
together
and
it
was
astonishing
how
much
the
one
could
do
for
the
other
without
undue
effort
there
were
the
clothes
of
course
and
old
housekeeping
things
odd
bits
of
furniture
food
from
the
kitchen
a
job
for
one
of
the
boys
in
the
garden
a
day
work
for
one
of
the
girls
in
the
house
i
tell
you
i
have
lists
of
hundreds
of
poor
families
who
feel
now
that
they
have
some
one
to
fall
back
upon
and
the
richer
half
of
the
combination
take
a
tremendous
interest
in
their
as
some
of
them
call
it
sometimes
there
is
trouble
but
the
world
is
governed
by
majorities
and
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
thing
has
turned
out
excellently
there
the
essence
of
charity
in
the
idea
the
personal
note
macheson
remarked
how
the
canadian
farm
going
finlayson
we
paying
our
way
finlayson
answered
and
you
should
see
our
boys
they
come
out
thin
and
white
all
skin
and
bones
you
recognize
one
of
them
in
six
months
they
good
workers
too
nine
hundred
altogether
in
the
and
we
want
more
i
hoping
to
take
a
hundred
back
with
me
it
a
grand
country
macheson
said
i
glad
it
part
of
the
empire
finlayson
or
i
should
grudge
you
those
boys
we
ca
spare
too
many
hinton
your
work
speaks
for
itself
hinton
the
only
one
in
clerical
dress
smiled
a
little
wearily
sometimes
he
said
i
wish
it
would
speak
a
little
louder
east
end
work
is
all
the
same
one
feels
ashamed
of
preaching
religion
to
a
starving
people
macheson
nodded
his
sympathy
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
it
drove
me
from
the
east
to
the
west
we
should
preach
at
the
one
and
feed
the
other
of
course
i
personally
have
always
been
handicapped
i
have
been
able
to
subscribe
to
any
of
the
established
churches
but
i
do
believe
in
the
laws
of
retribution
whether
you
call
them
human
or
divine
one
moral
delinquencies
pay
one
out
just
as
bodily
excesses
do
always
one
debts
are
to
be
paid
and
it
a
terrible
burden
the
drones
must
carry
after
all
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
heaps
of
sound
moral
teaching
to
be
drummed
into
our
without
the
necessity
of
being
orthodox
you
speak
lightly
of
your
own
work
macheson
franklin
said
but
there
is
one
thing
we
must
none
of
us
forget
our
schools
our
farms
our
colonies
all
our
attempts
indeed
owe
their
very
being
to
your
open
purse
macheson
held
out
his
hand
franklin
he
said
i
want
to
tell
you
something
which
i
think
none
of
you
know
i
want
to
tell
you
where
most
of
my
money
came
from
and
you
understand
then
why
i
been
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
it
or
a
part
of
it
in
this
way
did
you
ever
hear
of
ferguson
davis
the
yes
i
can
see
by
your
faces
you
did
well
he
was
my
mother
brother
and
he
died
without
a
will
when
i
was
a
child
and
the
whole
lot
came
to
me
a
million
and
a
quarter
some
one
murmured
more
macheson
answered
i
was
at
oxford
when
i
understood
exactly
the
whole
business
and
it
seemed
like
nothing
but
a
curse
to
me
then
i
talked
to
the
dear
old
professor
and
he
showed
me
the
way
i
can
honestly
say
that
not
one
penny
of
that
money
has
ever
been
spent
directly
or
indirectly
upon
myself
i
believe
that
if
the
old
man
could
come
to
life
and
read
my
he
have
a
worse
fit
than
the
one
which
carried
him
off
i
appointed
myself
the
trustee
of
his
fortune
and
it
spread
pretty
well
all
over
the
world
i
never
refused
to
stand
at
the
back
of
any
reasonable
scheme
for
the
betterment
of
our
there
have
been
a
few
failures
perhaps
but
many
successes
the
davis
buildings
are
mine
in
trust
of
course
done
well
i
a
larger
scheme
on
hand
now
on
the
same
lines
and
in
spite
of
it
all
the
money
grows
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
the
old
man
chose
his
investments
well
and
many
of
our
purely
philanthropic
schemes
are
beginning
to
pay
their
way
it
is
that
i
care
a
fig
about
the
money
but
you
must
try
to
make
these
things
or
you
injure
the
character
of
those
who
benefit
by
them
now
i
told
you
all
the
truth
but
do
let
it
go
out
of
this
room
you
can
consider
yourselves
with
me
if
you
like
show
me
an
honest
way
to
use
money
for
the
real
benefit
of
the
world
unfortunates
and
yours
as
much
as
mine
it
magnificent
franklin
murmured
it
justice
macheson
answered
the
money
was
wrung
from
the
poor
and
it
goes
back
to
them
perhaps
it
a
saner
distribution
for
the
improvident
and
shiftless
of
the
world
who
go
to
the
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
of
the
club
in
which
they
were
holding
their
informal
meeting
entered
and
addressed
macheson
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
but
there
is
a
young
man
here
who
wants
to
see
you
at
once
he
would
not
give
his
name
but
he
says
that
his
business
is
urgent
where
is
he
macheson
asked
in
the
smaller
strangers
room
sir
macheson
excused
himself
and
crossing
the
hall
entered
the
barely
furnished
apartment
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
a
young
man
was
walking
up
and
down
with
fierce
restless
movements
he
was
pale
untidily
dressed
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
curious
look
of
terror
as
though
all
the
time
he
saw
beyond
the
walls
of
the
room
things
which
kept
him
breathless
with
fear
macheson
pausing
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
failed
on
the
instant
to
recognize
him
then
he
closed
the
door
and
advanced
into
the
room
hurd
he
exclaimed
what
do
you
want
what
is
the
matter
matter
enough
hurd
declared
wildly
i
have
been
a
fool
and
a
blackguard
those
two
got
round
me
the
old
man
and
his
cursed
i
must
have
been
mad
what
have
you
done
macheson
asked
sharply
she
treated
me
badly
hurd
continued
made
a
fool
of
me
before
you
and
turned
me
away
from
thorpe
i
wanted
to
cry
quits
with
her
and
those
two
got
hold
of
me
jean
le
roi
is
her
husband
she
refused
to
see
him
to
hear
from
him
letty
foulton
is
there
and
i
have
been
allowed
to
visit
her
i
knew
the
back
way
in
and
i
took
jean
le
roi
there
an
hour
ago
and
he
is
waiting
in
her
room
until
she
comes
home
good
god
macheson
murmured
you
unspeakable
blackguard
he
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
past
midnight
what
time
was
she
expected
home
he
demanded
soon
after
eleven
she
was
only
dining
out
he
he
swore
that
he
only
wanted
to
talk
to
her
to
threaten
her
with
exposure
she
deserved
that
but
he
is
a
madman
when
i
left
him
i
was
afraid
he
carries
a
knife
always
and
he
kept
on
saying
that
she
was
his
wife
i
left
him
there
waiting
and
when
i
wanted
him
to
promise
that
there
should
be
no
violence
he
laughed
at
me
he
is
hidden
in
her
room
i
thought
that
it
was
only
money
he
wanted
but
but
macheson
flung
him
on
one
side
he
caught
up
his
hat
and
rushed
out
of
the
club
chapter
xvi
man
to
man
hortense
smiled
softly
to
herself
as
she
laid
down
the
brushes
what
did
it
mean
she
wondered
when
her
mistress
went
out
with
tired
eyes
and
pallid
cheeks
and
came
home
with
the
colour
of
a
rose
and
eyes
like
stars
humming
an
old
french
and
her
feet
moving
all
the
time
to
some
unheard
music
it
was
years
since
she
had
seen
her
like
this
hortense
knew
the
signs
and
was
well
pleased
at
last
then
the
household
was
to
be
properly
established
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
her
mistress
without
a
lover
was
to
hortense
an
incomprehensible
thing
you
can
go
now
hortense
her
mistress
ordered
i
will
have
my
coffee
half
an
hour
earlier
morning
very
good
madame
the
girl
answered
there
is
nothing
else
then
nothing
thank
you
wilhelmina
answered
you
had
better
go
to
bed
now
i
have
been
keeping
you
up
rather
late
the
last
few
evenings
we
must
both
turn
over
a
new
leaf
hortense
departed
smiling
to
herself
it
was
always
like
this
when
it
came
one
thought
of
others
and
one
wanted
to
be
alone
she
too
hummed
a
few
bars
of
that
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
wilhelmina
rose
from
her
chair
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
herself
in
the
long
oval
hortense
had
chosen
for
her
a
french
with
the
palest
of
light
blue
ribbons
drawn
through
the
lace
wilhelmina
looked
at
herself
and
smiled
was
it
the
light
the
colouring
or
was
she
really
still
so
good
to
look
at
her
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
was
long
and
silky
the
lines
seemed
to
have
been
smoothed
out
of
her
face
she
was
like
herself
when
she
had
been
a
girl
she
followed
the
slender
lines
of
her
figure
down
past
the
lace
of
her
petticoat
to
her
feet
still
encased
in
her
evening
slippers
with
diamond
buckles
and
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
what
was
she
yet
but
a
girl
fate
had
cheated
her
of
some
of
the
years
but
she
was
barely
how
wonderful
to
be
young
still
and
feel
one
blood
flow
to
music
like
this
her
thoughts
ran
riot
her
mouth
trembled
and
a
deeper
colour
stained
her
cheeks
then
she
heard
a
voice
behind
her
a
living
voice
in
her
room
and
as
swiftly
as
those
other
mysterious
thoughts
had
stolen
into
her
heart
came
the
chill
of
a
deadly
indescribable
fear
charming
ravishing
it
is
almost
worth
the
six
years
of
waiting
dear
wife
she
began
to
tremble
she
could
not
have
called
out
or
framed
any
intelligible
sentence
to
save
her
life
it
was
like
a
nightmare
the
horror
was
there
without
the
power
of
movement
or
speech
he
moved
his
position
and
came
within
the
range
of
her
terrified
vision
hurd
twenty
pounds
and
a
little
more
added
to
it
had
done
wonders
he
wore
correct
evening
clothes
correctly
worn
except
for
his
good
looks
the
good
looks
of
a
devil
he
would
have
attracted
notice
nowhere
he
leaned
against
the
couch
and
though
his
lips
curled
into
a
sneer
there
was
a
flame
in
his
eyes
a
horrible
admiration
she
tried
to
pray
you
are
overcome
he
murmured
softly
ah
why
not
six
years
since
our
happiness
was
snatched
from
us
chérie
ah
but
it
was
cruel
you
have
thought
of
me
i
trust
you
have
pitied
me
ah
how
often
i
have
lain
awake
at
night
in
my
cell
fondly
imagining
some
such
reunion
as
this
she
forced
herself
to
speak
through
lips
suddenly
pale
what
strange
words
they
sounded
frozen
things
scarcely
audible
yet
the
effort
hurt
her
i
will
give
you
the
money
she
said
more
if
you
will
ah
he
said
reflectively
the
money
i
had
forgotten
that
it
was
not
kind
of
you
to
run
away
and
hide
little
woman
it
was
not
kind
of
you
to
send
me
nothing
when
i
was
in
prison
oh
i
suffered
i
can
tell
you
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
made
up
for
pet
if
you
had
not
reminded
me
just
now
these
things
seem
so
little
dear
little
wife
you
are
enchanting
almost
you
turn
my
head
he
came
slowly
towards
her
she
threw
up
her
hands
wait
she
begged
oh
wait
listen
i
am
in
your
power
i
admit
it
i
will
make
terms
i
will
sign
anything
what
is
it
that
you
want
you
shall
be
rich
but
you
must
go
away
you
must
leave
me
now
he
looked
at
her
steadily
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
eyes
were
on
fire
with
evil
things
little
wife
he
said
with
a
shade
of
mockery
in
his
lowered
tone
i
can
not
do
that
consider
how
you
were
snatched
from
my
arms
consider
the
cruelty
of
it
as
for
the
money
bah
i
have
come
to
claim
my
own
do
you
understand
you
bewitching
little
fool
it
is
you
i
want
the
money
can
wait
i
can
not
he
came
nearer
still
and
she
shrank
like
a
terrified
dumb
thing
against
her
magnificent
with
its
load
of
priceless
trinkets
she
tried
to
call
out
but
her
voice
seemed
gone
and
he
only
laughed
as
he
laid
his
hand
over
her
mouth
and
drew
her
gently
towards
him
with
a
sudden
unnatural
strength
she
wrested
herself
from
his
arms
oh
listen
to
me
listen
to
me
for
one
moment
first
she
begged
frantically
it
true
that
i
married
you
but
it
was
all
a
plot
and
i
was
a
child
you
shall
have
your
share
of
my
money
leave
me
alone
and
i
swear
it
you
shall
be
rich
you
can
go
back
to
paris
and
be
an
adventurer
no
longer
you
shall
spend
your
own
money
you
can
live
your
own
life
even
then
her
brain
moved
quickly
she
dared
not
speak
of
annette
for
fear
of
making
him
desperate
it
was
his
cupidity
to
which
she
appealed
i
am
no
wife
of
yours
she
moaned
you
shall
have
more
money
than
you
ever
had
before
in
your
life
but
do
make
me
kill
myself
for
i
shall
if
you
touch
me
he
was
so
close
to
her
now
that
his
hot
breath
scorched
her
cheek
is
it
that
another
has
taken
my
place
he
asked
yes
no
that
is
there
is
some
one
whom
i
love
she
cried
listen
you
know
what
you
can
do
with
money
in
paris
anything
everything
he
was
so
close
to
her
now
that
the
words
died
away
upon
her
lips
little
wife
he
whispered
do
you
understand
that
i
am
a
man
and
that
it
is
you
i
want
again
she
tried
to
scream
but
his
hand
covered
her
mouth
his
arm
was
suddenly
around
her
then
he
started
back
with
an
oath
and
looked
towards
the
door
of
her
bedroom
who
is
in
that
room
he
asked
quickly
my
maid
she
lied
he
took
a
quick
step
across
the
room
the
door
was
flung
open
and
macheson
entered
wilhelmina
fainted
but
forced
herself
back
into
consciousness
with
a
sheer
effort
of
will
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
she
tried
to
drag
herself
towards
the
bell
but
jean
le
roi
stood
in
the
way
jean
le
roi
was
calm
but
wicked
what
are
you
doing
in
my
wife
bedroom
he
asked
i
am
here
to
see
you
out
of
the
house
macheson
answered
with
one
breathless
glance
around
the
room
will
you
come
quietly
out
of
my
own
house
jean
le
roi
said
softly
out
of
my
wife
room
who
are
you
illustration
the
bone
snapped
and
the
knife
fell
from
the
nerveless
fingers
page
never
mind
macheson
answered
her
friend
let
that
be
enough
and
let
me
tell
you
this
if
i
had
come
too
late
i
would
have
wrung
your
neck
jean
le
roi
sprang
at
him
like
a
cat
his
legs
off
the
ground
one
arm
around
the
other
neck
and
something
gleaming
in
his
right
hand
nothing
but
macheson
superb
strength
saved
him
he
risked
being
throttled
and
caught
jean
le
roi
right
arm
in
such
a
grip
that
he
swung
him
half
round
the
room
the
bone
snapped
and
the
knife
fell
from
the
nerveless
fingers
but
macheson
let
go
a
second
too
soon
jean
le
roi
had
all
the
courage
and
the
insensibility
to
pain
of
a
brute
animal
he
stretched
out
his
foot
and
with
a
trick
of
his
old
days
tripped
macheson
so
that
he
fell
heavily
jean
le
roi
bent
over
him
on
his
knees
breathing
heavily
and
with
murder
in
his
eyes
macheson
scarcely
breathed
he
lay
perfectly
still
jean
le
roi
staggered
to
his
feet
and
turned
towards
wilhelmina
you
see
madame
he
said
seizing
her
by
the
wrist
how
i
shall
deal
with
your
lovers
if
there
are
any
more
of
them
no
use
tugging
at
that
bell
i
saw
to
that
before
you
came
i
used
to
fighting
for
what
i
want
and
i
think
i
won
you
he
caught
her
into
his
arms
but
suddenly
released
her
with
a
low
animal
cry
he
knew
that
this
was
the
end
for
he
was
pinioned
from
behind
a
child
in
the
mighty
grip
which
held
him
powerless
you
are
a
little
too
hasty
my
friend
macheson
remarked
i
was
afraid
i
might
not
be
so
quick
as
you
on
my
feet
so
i
rested
for
a
moment
but
no
man
has
ever
escaped
from
this
grip
till
i
chose
to
let
him
go
now
he
added
turning
to
wilhelmina
the
way
is
clear
will
you
go
outside
and
rouse
the
servants
do
come
back
you
are
quite
safe
she
faltered
absolutely
he
answered
i
could
hold
him
with
one
hand
jean
le
roi
lifted
his
head
his
brain
was
working
swiftly
listen
he
exclaimed
it
is
finished
i
am
beaten
i
jean
le
roi
admit
defeat
why
call
in
servants
the
affair
is
better
finished
between
ourselves
wilhelmina
paused
in
that
first
great
rush
of
relief
she
had
not
stopped
to
think
that
with
jean
le
roi
a
prisoner
and
herself
as
prosecutrix
the
whole
miserable
story
must
be
published
he
continued
give
me
money
he
said
only
a
half
of
what
you
offered
me
just
now
and
you
shall
have
your
freedom
wilhelmina
smiled
something
of
the
joy
of
a
few
hours
ago
came
faintly
back
to
her
i
have
already
that
she
answered
i
learnt
the
truth
jean
le
roi
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
game
was
up
then
what
an
evening
of
disasters
let
me
go
he
said
i
ask
no
more
wilhelmina
and
macheson
exchanged
glances
she
vanished
into
her
room
for
a
moment
and
reappeared
in
a
long
wrapper
come
with
me
softly
she
said
and
i
will
let
you
out
so
they
three
went
on
tiptoe
down
the
broad
stairs
macheson
and
wilhelmina
exchanged
no
words
yet
they
both
felt
that
the
future
was
different
for
them
you
can
give
macheson
your
address
wilhelmina
said
as
they
stood
at
the
front
door
i
will
send
you
something
to
help
you
make
a
fresh
start
but
jean
le
roi
laughed
i
play
only
for
the
great
stakes
he
murmured
with
a
swagger
and
when
i
lose
i
lose
so
he
vanished
into
the
darkness
and
macheson
and
wilhelmina
remained
with
clasped
hands
he
whispered
stooping
and
kissing
her
fingers
she
repeated
thank
god
you
came
she
was
too
weary
too
happy
to
ask
for
explanations
and
he
offered
none
all
the
time
as
he
crossed
the
square
and
turned
towards
his
house
those
words
rang
in
his
ears
chapter
xvii
lord
and
lady
bountiful
deyes
caught
a
vision
of
blue
in
the
window
and
crossed
the
lawn
lady
peggy
leaned
over
the
low
sill
between
them
was
only
a
fragrant
border
of
hyacinths
you
know
that
our
host
and
hostess
have
deserted
us
she
asked
he
nodded
they
have
gone
over
to
this
wonderful
convalescent
home
that
macheson
is
building
in
the
hills
he
remarked
i
am
not
sure
that
i
consider
it
good
manners
to
leave
us
to
entertain
one
another
i
am
not
sure
she
said
that
it
is
proper
wilhelmina
should
have
considered
that
we
are
her
only
guests
she
sat
down
in
the
and
leaned
back
against
the
corner
she
had
slept
well
and
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
sunshine
blue
too
was
her
most
becoming
colour
he
looked
at
her
admiringly
you
are
really
looking
very
well
this
morning
he
said
thank
you
she
answered
i
was
expecting
that
i
wonder
he
said
how
you
others
discover
the
secret
of
eternal
youth
you
and
macheson
and
wilhelmina
all
look
younger
than
you
did
last
year
i
seem
to
be
getting
older
all
by
myself
she
looked
at
him
critically
there
were
certainly
more
lines
about
his
face
and
the
suspicion
of
about
his
tired
eyes
age
she
said
is
simply
a
matter
of
volition
you
wear
yourself
out
fretting
for
the
impossible
one
has
one
desires
he
murmured
but
you
should
learn
she
said
to
let
your
desires
be
governed
by
your
reason
it
is
a
foolish
thing
to
want
what
you
may
not
have
you
think
that
it
is
like
that
with
me
he
asked
all
the
world
knows
she
answered
that
you
are
in
love
with
wilhelmina
one
must
be
in
love
with
someone
he
remarked
naturally
but
why
choose
a
woman
who
is
head
and
ears
in
love
with
some
one
else
it
can
not
last
he
answered
she
has
married
him
lady
peggy
reached
out
for
a
cushion
and
placed
it
behind
her
head
that
certainly
would
seem
hopeful
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
woman
myself
for
instance
she
said
but
wilhelmina
is
not
an
ordinary
woman
she
always
would
do
things
differently
from
other
people
i
do
want
to
make
you
more
unhappy
than
you
are
but
i
honestly
believe
that
wilhelmina
is
going
to
set
a
new
fashion
she
is
going
to
try
and
the
life
domestic
amongst
the
upper
classes
she
always
was
such
a
reformer
he
sighed
lady
peggy
nodded
sympathetically
of
course
one
ca
tell
how
it
may
turn
out
she
continued
but
at
present
they
seem
to
have
turned
life
into
a
sort
of
garden
of
eden
and
do
you
know
i
ca
help
fancying
that
there
is
the
slightest
chance
for
the
serpent
wilhelmina
is
so
fearfully
obstinate
the
thing
will
cloy
he
declared
i
fancy
not
she
answered
you
see
they
do
live
on
victor
macheson
is
by
way
of
being
a
masterful
person
and
wilhelmina
is
only
just
beginning
to
realize
the
fascination
of
being
ruled
frankly
gilbert
i
do
think
there
the
slightest
chance
for
you
he
sighed
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
he
said
regretfully
i
began
to
realize
it
last
night
when
we
went
into
the
library
unexpectedly
and
wilhelmina
blushed
no
woman
ought
to
blush
when
she
is
discovered
being
kissed
by
her
own
husband
wilhelmina
lady
peggy
said
stretching
out
her
hand
for
one
of
cigarettes
may
live
to
astonish
us
yet
but
of
one
thing
i
am
convinced
she
will
never
even
realize
the
other
sex
except
through
her
own
husband
i
am
afraid
she
will
grow
narrow
i
should
hate
to
write
as
her
epitaph
that
she
was
an
affectionate
wife
and
devoted
mother
but
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
that
is
what
it
will
come
to
in
that
case
deyes
remarked
gloomily
i
may
as
well
go
away
no
i
should
do
that
lady
peggy
said
i
should
try
to
alter
my
point
of
view
direct
me
please
he
begged
i
should
try
she
continued
to
put
a
bridle
upon
my
desires
and
take
up
the
reins
you
could
lead
them
in
a
more
suitable
direction
for
instance
there
is
myself
she
declared
he
laughed
quietly
you
he
repeated
why
you
are
the
most
incorrigible
flirt
in
christendom
you
would
no
more
tie
yourself
up
with
one
man
than
enter
a
nunnery
she
sighed
i
have
always
been
misunderstood
she
declared
looking
at
him
pathetically
out
of
her
delightful
eyes
what
you
call
my
flirtations
have
been
simply
my
attempts
more
or
less
clumsy
to
gain
a
husband
i
have
been
most
unlucky
no
one
ever
proposes
to
me
he
laughed
derisively
your
victims
have
been
too
loquacious
he
replied
how
about
gayton
who
went
to
africa
because
you
offered
to
be
his
friend
and
horris
he
came
to
my
rooms
to
tell
me
all
about
it
the
day
you
refused
him
and
sammy
palliser
you
treated
him
shockingly
i
had
forgotten
them
she
admitted
they
were
nice
men
too
all
of
them
but
they
all
made
the
same
mistake
i
remember
now
they
did
propose
to
me
that
of
course
was
fatal
i
scarcely
see
he
began
she
patted
him
gently
on
the
arm
my
dear
gilbert
she
said
have
i
always
said
that
i
never
intend
to
marry
any
one
who
proposes
to
me
when
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
i
am
going
to
do
the
proposing
myself
whether
it
is
leap
year
or
not
he
asked
decidedly
she
answered
men
can
always
shuffle
out
of
a
leap
year
declaration
my
man
wo
be
able
to
escape
i
can
promise
you
that
does
he
exist
then
deyes
asked
she
laughed
softly
he
existed
for
a
good
many
years
more
than
i
have
she
answered
i
was
thinking
of
marrying
a
baby
ah
does
he
know
well
i
not
sure
she
said
thoughtfully
he
ought
to
but
he
such
a
stupid
person
it
was
then
that
gilbert
deyes
received
the
shock
of
his
life
he
discovered
quite
suddenly
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
he
nearly
lost
his
head
perhaps
he
suggested
dropping
his
voice
and
astonished
to
find
that
it
was
not
quite
so
steady
as
usual
he
has
been
waiting
i
am
afraid
not
she
answered
looking
down
for
a
moment
at
the
buckle
in
her
waistband
he
looked
round
if
only
he
were
here
now
he
said
could
one
conceive
a
more
favourable
opportunity
an
april
morning
sunshine
flowers
everything
in
the
air
to
make
him
forget
that
he
is
an
old
fogey
and
deserve
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
now
deliciously
wet
her
brows
were
delicately
uplifted
i
could
do
it
she
murmured
unless
he
were
in
the
same
room
deyes
stepped
over
the
hyacinths
and
vaulted
through
the
window
wilhelmina
selected
a
freshly
cut
carefully
brushed
away
the
sawdust
and
sat
down
macheson
chose
another
and
lighted
a
cigarette
eventually
they
decided
that
they
were
too
far
away
and
selected
a
where
there
was
room
for
both
wilhelmina
unrolled
a
plan
and
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
forest
of
scaffold
poles
to
their
left
proceeded
to
try
to
realize
the
incomplete
building
macheson
watched
her
with
a
smile
victor
she
exclaimed
you
are
not
to
laugh
at
me
remember
this
is
my
first
attempt
at
doing
anything
worth
doing
and
of
course
keen
about
it
are
you
sure
we
shall
have
enough
bedrooms
enough
for
a
start
at
any
rate
he
answered
we
can
always
add
to
it
she
looked
once
more
at
that
forest
of
poles
at
the
slowly
rising
walls
through
whose
empty
windows
one
could
see
pictures
of
the
valley
below
one
can
build
she
murmured
one
can
build
always
but
think
victor
what
a
lot
of
time
i
wasted
before
i
knew
you
i
might
have
done
so
much
he
smiled
reassuringly
there
is
plenty
of
time
he
declared
better
to
start
late
and
build
on
a
sure
foundation
you
know
a
good
many
of
my
houses
had
to
come
down
as
fast
as
they
went
up
do
you
remember
for
instance
how
i
wanted
to
convert
all
your
villagers
by
storm
she
smiled
still
i
glad
you
came
to
try
she
said
softly
that
horrid
foreman
is
watching
us
victor
i
am
going
to
look
the
other
way
he
has
gone
now
macheson
said
slipping
his
arm
around
her
waist
dear
do
you
know
i
do
think
that
one
person
can
build
very
well
alone
it
a
cold
sort
of
building
when
it
finished
the
life
built
by
a
lonely
man
i
like
the
look
of
our
palace
better
wilhelmina
i
should
like
to
know
where
my
part
comes
in
she
asked
every
room
he
answered
will
need
adorning
and
the
lamps
one
person
alone
can
never
keep
them
alight
and
we
do
want
them
to
go
out
wilhelmina
do
you
remember
the
old
german
who
said
that
beautiful
thoughts
were
the
finest
pictures
to
hang
upon
your
walls
think
of
next
spring
when
we
shall
hear
the
children
from
that
miserable
town
running
about
in
the
woods
picking
primroses
do
you
see
how
yellow
they
are
against
the
green
moss
wilhelmina
rose
i
must
really
go
and
pick
some
she
said
what
about
your
pheasants
victor
he
laughed
i
find
plenty
of
sport
never
fear
he
answered
without
keeping
the
kiddies
shut
out
why
the
country
belongs
to
them
it
their
birthright
not
ours
they
walked
through
the
plantation
side
by
side
the
ground
was
still
soft
with
the
winter
rains
but
everywhere
the
sunlight
came
sweeping
in
up
the
glade
and
across
the
many
stretching
arms
of
tender
blossoming
green
the
ground
was
starred
with
primroses
and
in
every
sheltered
nook
were
violets
a
soft
west
wind
blew
in
their
faces
as
they
emerged
into
the
country
lane
below
them
was
the
valley
hung
with
a
faint
blue
mist
all
around
them
the
song
of
birds
the
growing
sounds
of
the
stirring
season
stephen
hurd
came
cantering
by
and
stopped
for
a
moment
to
speak
about
some
matter
connected
with
the
estates
my
love
to
letty
wilhelmina
said
graciously
as
he
rode
off
then
she
turned
to
macheson
stephen
hurd
is
a
little
corner
in
your
house
she
remarked
in
our
house
he
protested
i
should
never
have
considered
him
if
he
had
not
worked
out
his
own
salvation
if
he
had
reached
me
ten
minutes
later
she
gripped
his
arm
do
she
begged
he
laughed
do
ever
brood
over
grisly
impossibilities
he
said
the
man
never
breathed
who
could
have
kept
you
from
me
across
the
hills
home
or
are
your
shoes
too
thin
he
swung
open
the
gate
and
they
passed
through
only
to
descend
the
other
side
along
the
broad
green
walk
strewn
with
grey
rocks
and
bordered
with
gorse
bushes
aglow
with
yellow
blossom
they
skirted
the
fir
plantation
received
the
respectful
greetings
of
green
at
the
gamekeeper
cottage
and
crossing
the
lower
range
of
hills
approached
the
house
by
the
back
avenue
and
wilhelmina
laughed
softly
as
they
passed
along
the
green
lane
for
her
thoughts
travelled
back
to
one
wild
night
when
with
upraised
skirts
and
flying
trembling
footsteps
she
had
sped
along
into
a
new
world
she
clung
to
her
husband
arm
i
came
this
way
dear
when
i
set
out
that
night
to
kiss
you
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
full
on
the
lips
a
nice
state
you
flung
me
into
he
remarked
it
was
rather
an
exciting
evening
she
said
demurely
they
walked
straight
into
the
which
was
indiscreet
and
wilhelmina
screamed
peggy
she
cried
peggy
you
bad
girl
the
two
women
went
off
together
of
course
to
talk
about
it
and
deyes
and
macheson
like
englishmen
all
the
world
over
muttered
something
barely
comprehensible
and
then
looked
at
one
another
awkwardly
care
for
a
game
of
billiards
macheson
suggested
right

immense
relief
