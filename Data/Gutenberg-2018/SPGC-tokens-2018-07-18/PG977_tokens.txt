notes
by
rudyard
kipling
with
introduction
introduction
in
an
issue
of
the
london
world
in
april
there
appeared
the
following
paragraph
two
small
rooms
connected
by
a
tiny
hall
afford
sufficient
space
to
contain
rudyard
kipling
the
literary
hero
of
the
present
hour
man
who
came
from
nowhere
as
he
says
himself
and
who
a
year
ago
was
consciously
nothing
in
the
literary
six
months
previous
to
this
kipling
then
but
years
old
had
arrived
in
england
from
india
to
find
that
fame
had
preceded
him
he
had
already
gained
fame
in
india
where
scores
of
cultured
and
critical
people
after
reading
departmental
ditties
plain
tales
from
the
hills
and
various
other
stories
and
verses
had
stamped
him
for
a
genius
fortunately
for
everybody
who
reads
london
interested
and
stimulated
kipling
and
he
settled
down
to
writing
the
record
of
badalia
herodsfoot
and
his
first
novel
the
light
that
failed
appeared
in
and
then
a
collection
of
verse
life
handicap
being
stories
of
mine
own
people
was
published
simultaneously
in
london
and
new
york
city
then
followed
more
verse
and
so
on
through
an
unending
series
in
kipling
met
the
young
author
wolcott
balestier
at
that
time
connected
with
a
london
publishing
house
a
strong
attachment
grew
between
the
two
and
several
months
after
their
first
meeting
they
came
to
balestier
vermont
home
where
they
collaborated
on
the
naulahka
a
story
of
west
and
east
for
which
the
century
paid
the
largest
price
ever
given
by
an
american
magazine
for
a
story
the
following
year
kipling
married
balestier
sister
in
london
and
brought
her
to
america
the
balestiers
were
of
an
aristocratic
new
york
family
the
grandfather
of
kipling
was
balestier
a
prominent
lawyer
in
new
york
city
and
chicago
who
died
in
leaving
a
fortune
of
about
a
million
her
maternal
grandfather
was
peshine
smith
of
rochester
a
noted
author
and
jurist
who
was
selected
in
by
secretary
hamilton
fish
to
go
to
japan
as
the
mikado
adviser
in
international
law
the
ancestral
home
of
the
balestiers
was
near
brattleboro
and
here
kipling
brought
his
bride
the
young
englishman
was
so
impressed
by
the
vermont
scenery
that
he
rented
for
a
time
the
cottage
on
the
bliss
farm
in
which
steele
mackaye
the
playwright
wrote
the
well
known
drama
hazel
the
next
spring
kipling
purchased
from
his
beatty
balestier
a
tract
of
land
about
three
miles
north
of
brattleboro
and
on
this
erected
a
house
at
a
cost
of
nearly
which
he
named
the
this
was
his
home
during
his
sojourn
in
america
here
he
wrote
when
in
the
mood
and
for
recreation
tramped
abroad
over
the
hills
his
social
duties
at
this
period
were
not
arduous
for
to
his
home
he
refused
admittance
to
all
but
tried
friends
he
made
a
study
of
the
yankee
country
dialect
and
character
for
the
walking
delegate
and
while
captains
courageous
the
story
of
new
england
fisher
life
was
before
him
he
spent
some
time
among
the
gloucester
fishermen
with
an
acquaintance
who
had
access
to
the
household
gods
of
these
people
he
returned
to
england
in
august
and
did
not
visit
america
again
till
when
he
came
with
his
wife
and
three
children
for
a
limited
time
it
is
hardly
fair
to
kipling
to
call
american
notes
first
impressions
for
one
reading
them
will
readily
see
that
the
impressions
are
superficial
little
thought
being
put
upon
the
writing
they
seem
and
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
kipling
is
antagonistic
to
america
in
every
respect
this
however
is
not
true
these
notes
aroused
much
protest
and
severe
criticism
when
they
appeared
in
and
are
considered
so
far
beneath
kipling
real
work
that
they
have
been
nearly
suppressed
and
are
rarely
found
in
a
list
of
his
writings
their
very
caustic
style
is
of
interest
to
a
student
and
lover
of
kipling
and
for
this
reason
the
publishers
believe
them
worthy
of
a
good
binding
contents
at
the
golden
gate
american
politics
american
salmon
the
yellowstone
chicago
the
american
army
america
defenceless
coasts
i
at
the
golden
gate
serene
indifferent
to
fate
thou
sittest
at
the
western
gate
thou
seest
the
white
seas
fold
their
tents
oh
warder
of
two
continents
thou
drawest
all
things
small
and
great
to
thee
beside
the
western
this
is
what
bret
harte
has
written
of
the
great
city
of
san
francisco
and
for
the
past
fortnight
i
have
been
wondering
what
made
him
do
it
there
is
neither
serenity
nor
indifference
to
be
found
in
these
parts
and
evil
would
it
be
for
the
continents
whose
wardship
were
intrusted
to
so
reckless
a
guardian
behold
me
pitched
from
twenty
days
of
the
high
seas
into
the
whirl
of
california
deprived
of
any
guidance
and
left
to
draw
my
own
conclusions
protect
me
from
the
wrath
of
an
outraged
community
if
these
letters
be
ever
read
by
american
eyes
san
francisco
is
a
mad
city
inhabited
for
the
most
part
by
perfectly
insane
people
whose
women
are
of
a
remarkable
beauty
when
the
city
of
pekin
steamed
through
the
golden
gate
i
saw
with
great
joy
that
the
which
guarded
the
mouth
of
the
finest
harbor
in
the
world
sir
could
be
silenced
by
two
gunboats
from
hong
kong
with
safety
comfort
and
despatch
also
there
was
not
a
single
american
vessel
of
war
in
the
harbor
this
may
sound
bloodthirsty
but
remember
i
had
come
with
a
grievance
upon
me
the
grievance
of
the
pirated
english
books
then
a
reporter
leaped
aboard
and
ere
i
could
gasp
held
me
in
his
toils
he
pumped
me
exhaustively
while
i
was
getting
ashore
demanding
of
all
things
in
the
world
news
about
indian
journalism
it
is
an
awful
thing
to
enter
a
new
land
with
a
new
lie
on
your
lips
i
spoke
the
truth
to
the
custom
house
man
who
turned
my
most
sacred
raiment
on
a
floor
composed
of
stable
refuse
and
pine
splinters
but
the
reporter
overwhelmed
me
not
so
much
by
his
poignant
audacity
as
his
beautiful
ignorance
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
did
not
tell
him
more
lies
as
i
passed
into
a
city
of
three
hundred
thousand
white
men
think
of
it
three
hundred
thousand
white
men
and
women
gathered
in
one
spot
walking
upon
real
pavements
in
front
of
shops
and
talking
something
that
at
first
hearing
was
not
very
different
from
english
it
was
only
when
i
had
tangled
myself
up
in
a
hopeless
maze
of
small
wooden
houses
dust
street
refuse
and
children
who
played
with
empty
kerosene
tins
that
i
discovered
the
difference
of
speech
you
want
to
go
to
the
palace
hotel
said
an
affable
youth
on
a
dray
what
in
hell
are
you
doing
here
then
this
is
about
the
lowest
ward
in
the
city
go
six
blocks
north
to
corner
of
geary
and
markey
then
walk
around
till
you
strike
corner
of
gutter
and
sixteenth
and
that
brings
you
i
do
not
vouch
for
the
literal
accuracy
of
these
directions
quoting
but
from
a
disordered
memory
amen
i
said
but
who
am
i
that
i
should
strike
the
corners
of
such
as
you
name
peradventure
they
be
gentlemen
of
repute
and
might
hit
back
bring
it
down
to
dots
my
i
thought
he
would
have
smitten
me
but
he
did
he
explained
that
no
one
ever
used
the
word
street
and
that
every
one
was
supposed
to
know
how
the
streets
ran
for
sometimes
the
names
were
upon
the
lamps
and
sometimes
they
were
fortified
with
these
directions
i
proceeded
till
i
found
a
mighty
street
full
of
sumptuous
buildings
four
and
five
stories
high
but
paved
with
rude
cobblestones
after
the
fashion
of
the
year
here
a
without
any
visible
means
of
support
slid
stealthily
behind
me
and
nearly
struck
me
in
the
back
this
was
the
famous
cable
car
of
san
francisco
which
runs
by
gripping
an
endless
wire
rope
sunk
in
the
ground
and
of
which
i
will
tell
you
more
anon
a
hundred
yards
further
there
was
a
slight
commotion
in
the
street
a
gathering
together
of
three
or
four
something
that
glittered
as
it
moved
very
swiftly
a
ponderous
irish
gentleman
with
priest
cords
in
his
hat
and
a
small
badge
on
his
fat
bosom
emerged
from
the
knot
supporting
a
chinaman
who
had
been
stabbed
in
the
eye
and
was
bleeding
like
a
pig
the
went
their
ways
and
the
chinaman
assisted
by
the
policeman
his
own
of
course
this
was
none
of
my
business
but
i
rather
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
to
the
gentleman
who
had
dealt
the
stab
it
said
a
great
deal
for
the
excellence
of
the
municipal
arrangement
of
the
town
that
a
surging
crowd
did
not
at
once
block
the
street
to
see
what
was
going
forward
i
was
the
sixth
man
and
the
last
who
assisted
at
the
performance
and
my
curiosity
was
six
times
the
greatest
indeed
i
felt
ashamed
of
showing
it
there
were
no
more
incidents
till
i
reached
the
palace
hotel
a
warren
of
humanity
with
a
thousand
rooms
in
it
all
the
travel
books
will
tell
you
about
hotel
arrangements
in
this
country
they
should
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
understand
clearly
and
this
letter
is
written
after
a
thousand
miles
of
experiences
that
money
will
not
buy
you
service
in
the
west
when
the
hotel
clerk
the
man
who
awards
your
room
to
you
and
who
is
supposed
to
give
you
information
when
that
resplendent
individual
stoops
to
attend
to
your
wants
he
does
so
whistling
or
humming
or
picking
his
teeth
or
pauses
to
converse
with
some
one
he
knows
these
performances
i
gather
are
to
impress
upon
you
that
he
is
a
free
man
and
your
equal
from
his
general
appearance
and
the
size
of
his
diamonds
he
ought
to
be
your
superior
there
is
no
necessity
for
this
swaggering
of
freedom
business
is
business
and
the
man
who
is
paid
to
attend
to
a
man
might
reasonably
devote
his
whole
attention
to
the
job
out
of
office
hours
he
can
take
his
coach
and
four
and
pervade
society
if
he
pleases
in
a
vast
hall
under
the
glare
of
an
electric
light
sat
forty
or
fifty
men
and
for
their
use
and
amusement
were
provided
spittoons
of
infinite
capacity
and
generous
gape
most
of
the
men
wore
and
the
things
that
we
in
india
put
on
at
a
if
we
possess
them
but
they
all
spat
they
spat
on
principle
the
spittoons
were
on
the
staircases
in
each
bedroom
yea
and
in
chambers
even
more
sacred
than
these
they
chased
one
into
retirement
but
they
blossomed
in
chiefest
splendor
round
the
bar
and
they
were
all
used
every
reeking
one
of
them
just
before
i
began
to
feel
deathly
sick
another
reporter
grappled
me
what
he
wanted
to
know
was
the
precise
area
of
india
in
square
miles
i
referred
him
to
whittaker
he
had
never
heard
of
whittaker
he
wanted
it
from
my
own
mouth
and
i
would
not
tell
him
then
he
swerved
off
just
like
the
other
man
to
details
of
journalism
in
our
own
country
i
ventured
to
suggest
that
the
interior
economy
of
a
paper
most
concerned
the
people
who
worked
it
that
the
very
thing
that
interests
us
he
said
have
you
got
reporters
anything
like
our
reporters
on
indian
newspapers
we
have
not
i
said
and
suppressed
the
thank
god
rising
to
my
lips
why
have
you
said
he
because
they
would
die
i
said
it
was
exactly
like
talking
to
a
child
a
very
rude
little
child
he
would
begin
almost
every
sentence
with
now
tell
me
something
about
india
and
would
turn
aimlessly
from
one
question
to
the
other
without
the
least
continuity
i
was
not
angry
but
keenly
interested
the
man
was
a
revelation
to
me
to
his
questions
i
returned
answers
mendacious
and
evasive
after
all
it
really
did
not
matter
what
i
said
he
could
not
understand
i
can
only
hope
and
pray
that
none
of
the
readers
of
the
pioneer
will
ever
see
that
portentous
interview
the
man
made
me
out
to
be
an
idiot
several
sizes
more
drivelling
than
my
destiny
intended
and
the
rankness
of
his
ignorance
managed
to
distort
the
few
poor
facts
with
which
i
supplied
him
into
large
and
elaborate
lies
then
thought
i
the
matter
of
american
journalism
shall
be
looked
into
later
on
at
present
i
will
enjoy
no
man
rose
to
tell
me
what
were
the
lions
of
the
place
no
one
volunteered
any
sort
of
conveyance
i
was
absolutely
alone
in
this
big
city
of
white
folk
by
instinct
i
sought
refreshment
and
came
upon
a
barroom
full
of
bad
salon
pictures
in
which
men
with
hats
on
the
backs
of
their
heads
were
wolfing
food
from
a
counter
it
was
the
institution
of
the
free
lunch
i
had
struck
you
paid
for
a
drink
and
got
as
much
as
you
wanted
to
eat
for
something
less
than
a
rupee
a
day
a
man
can
feed
himself
sumptuously
in
san
francisco
even
though
he
be
a
bankrupt
remember
this
if
ever
you
are
stranded
in
these
parts
later
i
began
a
vast
but
unsystematic
exploration
of
the
streets
i
asked
for
no
names
it
was
enough
that
the
pavements
were
full
of
white
men
and
women
the
streets
clanging
with
traffic
and
that
the
restful
roar
of
a
great
city
rang
in
my
ears
the
cable
cars
glided
to
all
points
of
the
compass
at
once
i
took
them
one
by
one
till
i
could
go
no
further
san
francisco
has
been
pitched
down
on
the
sand
bunkers
of
the
bikaneer
desert
about
one
fourth
of
it
is
ground
reclaimed
from
the
sea
any
will
tell
you
all
about
that
the
remainder
is
just
ragged
unthrifty
sand
hills
pegged
down
by
houses
from
an
english
point
of
view
there
has
not
been
the
least
attempt
at
grading
those
hills
and
indeed
you
might
as
well
try
to
grade
the
hillocks
of
sind
the
cable
cars
have
for
all
practical
purposes
made
san
francisco
a
dead
level
they
take
no
count
of
rise
or
fall
but
slide
equably
on
their
appointed
courses
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
a
street
they
turn
corners
almost
at
right
angles
cross
other
lines
and
for
aught
i
know
may
run
up
the
sides
of
houses
there
is
no
visible
agency
of
their
flight
but
once
in
awhile
you
shall
pass
a
building
humming
with
machinery
that
winds
up
an
everlasting
wire
cable
and
the
initiated
will
tell
you
that
here
is
the
mechanism
i
gave
up
asking
questions
if
it
pleases
providence
to
make
a
car
run
up
and
down
a
slit
in
the
ground
for
many
miles
and
if
for
twopence
halfpenny
i
can
ride
in
that
car
why
shall
i
seek
the
reasons
of
the
miracle
rather
let
me
look
out
of
the
windows
till
the
shops
give
place
to
thousands
and
thousands
of
little
houses
made
of
wood
to
imitate
stone
each
house
just
big
enough
for
a
man
and
his
family
let
me
watch
the
people
in
the
cars
and
try
to
find
out
in
what
manner
they
differ
from
us
their
ancestors
it
grieves
me
now
that
i
cursed
them
in
the
matter
of
book
piracy
because
i
perceived
that
my
curse
is
working
and
that
their
speech
is
becoming
a
horror
already
they
delude
themselves
into
the
belief
that
they
talk
english
the
english
and
i
have
already
been
pitied
for
speaking
with
an
english
the
man
who
pitied
me
spoke
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
language
of
thieves
and
they
all
do
where
we
put
the
accent
forward
they
throw
it
back
and
vice
versa
where
we
give
the
long
a
they
use
the
short
and
words
so
simple
as
to
be
past
mistaking
they
pronounce
somewhere
up
in
the
dome
of
their
heads
how
do
these
things
happen
oliver
wendell
holmes
says
that
the
yankee
the
cider
and
the
salt
codfish
of
the
eastern
states
are
responsible
for
what
he
calls
a
nasal
accent
i
know
better
they
stole
books
from
across
the
water
without
paying
for
and
the
snort
of
delight
was
fixed
in
their
nostrils
forever
by
a
just
providence
that
is
why
they
talk
a
foreign
tongue
cats
is
dogs
and
rabbits
is
dogs
and
so
parrots
but
this
tortoise
is
an
insect
so
there
ai
no
charge
as
the
old
porter
said
a
hindoo
is
a
hindoo
and
a
brother
to
the
man
who
knows
his
vernacular
and
a
frenchman
is
french
because
he
speaks
his
own
language
but
the
american
has
no
language
he
is
dialect
slang
provincialism
accent
and
so
forth
now
that
i
have
heard
their
voices
all
the
beauty
of
bret
harte
is
being
ruined
for
me
because
i
find
myself
catching
through
the
roll
of
his
rhythmical
prose
the
cadence
of
his
peculiar
fatherland
get
an
american
lady
to
read
to
you
how
santa
claus
came
to
bar
and
see
how
much
is
under
her
tongue
left
of
the
beauty
of
the
original
but
i
am
sorry
for
bret
harte
it
happened
this
way
a
reporter
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
city
and
i
made
answer
suavely
that
it
was
hallowed
ground
to
me
because
of
bret
harte
that
was
true
well
said
the
reporter
bret
harte
claims
california
but
california
do
claim
bret
harte
he
been
so
long
in
england
that
he
quite
english
have
you
seen
our
cracker
factories
or
the
new
offices
of
the
he
could
not
understand
that
to
the
outside
world
the
city
was
worth
a
great
deal
less
than
the
man
i
never
intended
to
curse
the
people
with
a
provincialism
so
vast
as
this
but
let
us
return
to
our
sheep
which
means
the
of
the
cliff
house
they
are
the
great
show
of
san
francisco
you
take
a
train
which
pulls
up
the
middle
of
the
street
it
killed
two
people
the
day
before
yesterday
being
unbraked
and
driven
absolutely
regardless
of
consequences
and
you
pull
up
somewhere
at
the
back
of
the
city
on
the
pacific
beach
originally
the
cliffs
and
their
approaches
must
have
been
pretty
but
they
have
been
so
carefully
defiled
with
advertisements
that
they
are
now
one
big
blistered
abomination
a
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
stood
a
big
rock
covered
with
the
carcasses
of
the
sleek
who
roared
and
rolled
and
walloped
in
the
spouting
surges
no
bold
man
had
painted
the
creatures
or
advertised
newspapers
on
their
backs
wherefore
they
did
not
match
the
landscape
which
was
chiefly
hoarding
some
day
perhaps
whatever
sort
of
government
may
obtain
in
this
country
will
make
a
restoration
of
the
place
and
keep
it
clean
and
neat
at
present
the
sovereign
people
of
whom
i
have
heard
so
much
already
are
vending
cherries
and
painting
the
virtues
of
little
bile
beans
all
over
it
night
fell
over
the
pacific
and
the
white
whipped
through
the
streets
dimming
the
splendors
of
the
electric
lights
it
is
the
use
of
this
city
her
men
and
women
folk
to
parade
between
the
hours
of
eight
and
ten
a
certain
street
called
cairn
street
where
the
finest
shops
are
situated
here
the
click
of
high
heels
on
the
pavement
is
loudest
here
the
lights
are
brightest
and
here
the
thunder
of
the
traffic
is
most
overwhelming
i
watched
young
california
and
saw
that
it
was
at
least
expensively
dressed
cheerful
in
manner
and
in
conversation
also
the
women
were
very
fair
perhaps
eighteen
days
aboard
ship
had
something
to
do
with
my
unreserved
admiration
the
maidens
were
of
generous
build
large
well
groomed
and
attired
in
raiment
that
even
to
my
inexperienced
eyes
must
have
cost
much
cairn
street
at
nine
levels
all
distinctions
of
rank
as
impartially
as
the
grave
again
and
again
i
loitered
at
the
heels
of
a
couple
of
resplendent
beings
only
to
overhear
when
i
expected
the
level
voice
of
culture
the
staccato
sez
he
sez
i
that
is
the
mark
of
the
white
all
the
world
over
this
was
depressing
because
in
spite
of
all
that
goes
to
the
contrary
fine
feathers
ought
to
make
fine
birds
there
was
wealth
unlimited
wealth
in
the
streets
but
not
an
accent
that
would
not
have
been
dear
at
fifty
cents
wherefore
revolving
in
my
mind
that
these
folk
were
barbarians
i
was
presently
enlightened
and
made
aware
that
they
also
were
the
heirs
of
all
the
ages
and
civilized
after
all
there
appeared
before
me
an
affable
stranger
of
prepossessing
appearance
with
a
blue
and
an
innocent
eye
addressing
me
by
name
he
claimed
to
have
met
me
in
new
york
at
the
windsor
and
to
this
claim
i
gave
a
qualified
assent
i
did
not
remember
the
fact
but
since
he
was
so
certain
of
it
why
then
i
waited
developments
and
what
did
you
think
of
indiana
when
you
came
through
was
the
next
question
it
revealed
the
mystery
of
previous
acquaintance
and
one
or
two
other
things
with
reprehensible
carelessness
my
friend
of
the
eye
had
looked
up
the
name
of
his
victim
in
the
hotel
register
and
read
indiana
for
india
the
provincialism
with
which
i
had
cursed
his
people
extended
to
himself
he
could
not
imagine
an
englishman
coming
through
the
states
from
west
to
east
instead
of
by
the
regularly
ordained
route
my
fear
was
that
in
his
delight
in
finding
me
so
responsive
he
would
make
remarks
about
new
york
and
the
windsor
which
i
could
not
understand
and
indeed
he
adventured
in
this
direction
once
or
twice
asking
me
what
i
thought
of
such
and
such
streets
which
from
his
tone
i
gathered
to
be
anything
but
respectable
it
is
trying
to
talk
unknown
new
york
in
almost
unknown
san
francisco
but
my
friend
was
merciful
he
protested
that
i
was
one
after
his
own
heart
and
pressed
upon
me
rare
and
curious
drinks
at
more
than
one
bar
these
drinks
i
accepted
with
gratitude
as
also
the
cigars
with
which
his
pockets
were
stored
he
would
show
me
the
life
of
the
city
having
no
desire
to
watch
a
weary
old
play
again
i
evaded
the
offer
and
received
in
lieu
of
the
devil
instruction
much
coarse
flattery
curiously
constituted
is
the
soul
of
man
knowing
how
and
where
this
man
lied
waiting
idly
for
the
finale
i
was
distinctly
conscious
as
he
bubbled
compliments
in
my
ear
of
soft
thrills
of
gratified
pride
stealing
from
to
i
was
wise
quoth
he
anybody
could
see
that
with
half
an
eye
sagacious
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
world
an
acquaintance
to
be
desired
one
who
had
tasted
the
cup
of
life
with
discretion
all
this
pleased
me
and
in
a
measure
numbed
the
suspicion
that
was
thoroughly
aroused
eventually
the
one
discovered
nay
insisted
that
i
had
a
taste
for
cards
this
was
clumsily
worked
in
but
it
was
my
fault
for
in
that
i
met
him
and
allowed
him
no
chance
of
good
acting
hereupon
i
laid
my
head
upon
one
side
and
simulated
unholy
wisdom
quoting
odds
and
ends
of
poker
talk
all
ludicrously
misapplied
my
friend
kept
his
countenance
admirably
and
well
he
might
for
five
minutes
later
we
arrived
always
by
the
purest
of
chance
at
a
place
where
we
could
play
cards
and
also
frivol
with
louisiana
state
lottery
tickets
would
i
play
nay
said
i
for
to
me
cards
have
neither
meaning
nor
continuity
but
let
us
assume
that
i
am
going
to
play
how
would
you
and
your
friends
get
to
work
would
you
play
a
straight
game
or
make
me
drunk
or
well
the
fact
is
i
a
newspaper
man
and
i
be
much
obliged
if
you
let
me
know
something
about
bunco
my
friend
erected
himself
into
an
obelisk
of
profanity
he
cursed
me
by
his
gods
the
right
and
left
bower
he
even
cursed
the
very
good
cigars
he
had
given
me
but
the
storm
over
he
quieted
down
and
explained
i
apologized
for
causing
him
to
waste
an
evening
and
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
time
together
inaccuracy
provincialism
and
a
too
hasty
rushing
to
conclusions
were
the
rocks
that
he
had
split
on
but
he
got
his
revenge
when
he
said
how
would
i
play
with
you
from
all
the
poppycock
anglice
bosh
you
talked
about
poker
i
ha
played
a
straight
game
and
skinned
you
i
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
make
you
drunk
you
never
knew
anything
of
the
game
but
how
i
was
mistaken
in
going
to
work
on
you
makes
me
he
glared
at
me
as
though
i
had
done
him
an
injury
i
know
how
it
is
that
year
after
year
week
after
week
the
bunco
steerer
who
is
the
confidence
trick
and
the
man
of
other
climes
secures
his
prey
he
clavers
them
over
with
flattery
as
the
snake
clavers
the
rabbit
the
incident
depressed
me
because
it
showed
i
had
left
the
innocent
east
far
behind
and
was
come
to
a
country
where
a
man
must
look
out
for
himself
the
very
hotels
bristled
with
notices
about
keeping
my
door
locked
and
depositing
my
valuables
in
a
safe
the
white
man
in
a
lump
is
bad
weeping
softly
for
little
i
knew
then
that
my
heart
was
to
be
torn
afresh
from
my
bosom
i
fell
asleep
in
the
clanging
hotel
next
morning
i
had
entered
upon
the
deferred
inheritance
there
are
no
princes
in
america
at
least
with
crowns
on
their
heads
but
a
member
of
some
royal
family
received
my
letter
of
introduction
ere
the
day
closed
i
was
a
member
of
the
two
clubs
and
booked
for
many
engagements
to
dinner
and
party
now
this
prince
upon
whose
financial
operations
be
continual
increase
had
no
reason
nor
had
the
others
his
friends
to
put
himself
out
for
the
sake
of
one
briton
more
or
less
but
he
rested
not
till
he
had
accomplished
all
in
my
behalf
that
a
mother
could
think
of
for
her
debutante
daughter
do
you
know
the
bohemian
club
of
san
francisco
they
say
its
fame
extends
over
the
world
it
was
created
somewhat
on
the
lines
of
the
savage
by
men
who
wrote
or
drew
things
and
has
blossomed
into
most
unrepublican
luxury
the
ruler
of
the
place
is
an
owl
an
owl
standing
upon
a
skull
and
showing
forth
grimly
the
wisdom
of
the
man
of
letters
and
the
end
of
his
hopes
for
immortality
the
owl
stands
on
the
staircase
a
statue
four
feet
high
is
carved
in
the
flutters
on
the
frescoed
ceiling
is
stamped
on
the
and
hangs
on
the
walls
he
is
an
ancient
and
honorable
bird
under
his
wing
my
privilege
to
meet
with
white
men
whose
lives
were
not
chained
down
to
routine
of
toil
who
wrote
magazine
articles
instead
of
reading
them
hurriedly
in
the
pauses
of
who
painted
pictures
instead
of
contenting
themselves
with
cheap
etchings
picked
up
at
another
man
sale
of
effects
mine
were
all
the
rights
of
social
intercourse
craft
by
craft
that
india
of
collectors
has
swindled
us
out
of
treading
soft
carpets
and
breathing
the
incense
of
superior
cigars
i
wandered
from
room
to
room
studying
the
paintings
in
which
the
members
of
the
club
had
caricatured
themselves
their
associates
and
their
aims
there
was
a
slick
french
audacity
about
the
workmanship
of
these
men
of
toil
unbending
that
went
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
beholder
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
french
a
dry
grimness
of
treatment
almost
dutch
marked
the
difference
the
men
painted
as
they
spoke
with
certainty
the
club
indulges
in
revelries
which
it
calls
jinks
high
and
low
at
intervals
and
each
of
these
gatherings
is
faithfully
portrayed
in
oils
by
hands
that
know
their
business
in
this
club
were
no
amateurs
spoiling
canvas
because
they
fancied
they
could
handle
oils
without
knowledge
of
shadows
or
anatomy
no
gentleman
of
leisure
ruining
the
temper
of
publishers
and
an
already
ruined
market
with
attempts
to
write
because
everybody
writes
something
these
my
hosts
were
working
or
had
worked
for
their
daily
bread
with
pen
or
paint
and
their
talk
for
the
most
part
was
of
the
shop
shoppy
that
is
to
say
delightful
they
extended
a
large
hand
of
welcome
and
were
as
brethren
and
i
did
homage
to
the
owl
and
listened
to
their
talk
an
indian
club
about
will
yield
if
properly
worked
an
abundant
harvest
of
queer
tales
but
at
a
gathering
of
americans
from
the
uttermost
ends
of
their
own
continent
the
tales
are
larger
thicker
more
spinous
and
even
more
azure
than
any
indian
variety
tales
of
the
war
i
heard
told
by
an
of
the
south
over
his
evening
drink
to
a
colonel
of
the
northern
army
my
introducer
who
had
served
as
a
trooper
in
the
northern
horse
throwing
in
emendations
from
time
to
time
tales
of
the
law
which
in
this
country
is
an
amazingly
elastic
affair
followed
from
the
lips
of
a
judge
forgive
me
for
recording
one
tale
that
struck
me
as
new
it
may
interest
the
bar
in
india
once
upon
a
time
there
was
samuelson
a
young
lawyer
who
feared
not
god
neither
regarded
the
bench
name
age
and
town
of
the
man
were
given
at
great
length
to
him
no
case
had
ever
come
as
a
client
partly
because
he
lived
in
a
district
where
lynch
law
prevailed
and
partly
because
the
most
desperate
prisoner
shrunk
from
intrusting
himself
to
the
mercies
of
a
phenomenal
stammerer
but
in
time
there
happened
an
aggravated
murder
so
bad
indeed
that
by
common
consent
the
citizens
decided
as
a
prelude
to
lynching
to
give
the
real
law
a
chance
they
could
in
fact
gambol
round
that
murder
they
met
the
court
in
its
and
against
the
raw
square
of
the
court
house
window
a
temptingly
suggestive
branch
of
a
tree
fretted
the
sky
no
one
appeared
for
the
prisoner
and
partly
in
jest
the
court
advised
young
samuelson
to
take
up
the
case
the
prisoner
is
undefended
sam
said
the
court
the
square
thing
to
do
would
be
for
you
to
take
him
aside
and
do
the
best
you
can
for
court
jury
and
witness
then
adjourned
to
the
veranda
while
samuelson
led
his
client
aside
to
the
court
house
cells
an
hour
passed
ere
the
lawyer
returned
alone
mutely
the
audience
questioned
may
it
the
said
my
client
case
is
a
one
a
bad
one
you
told
me
to
do
the
i
for
him
judge
so
i
jest
given
him
gelding
an
told
him
to
light
out
for
healthier
my
opinion
being
he
be
hanged
if
he
dallied
here
this
time
my
client
fifteen
mile
out
yonder
somewheres
that
was
the
i
could
do
for
him
may
it
the
the
young
man
escaping
punishment
in
lieu
of
the
prisoner
made
his
fortune
ere
five
years
other
voices
followed
with
equally
wondrous
tales
of
in
mexico
and
arizona
of
gambling
at
army
posts
in
texas
of
newspaper
wars
waged
in
godless
chicago
i
could
not
help
being
interested
but
they
were
not
pretty
tricks
of
deaths
sudden
and
violent
in
montana
and
dakota
of
the
loves
of
maidens
in
the
south
and
fantastic
huntings
for
gold
in
mysterious
alaska
above
all
they
told
the
story
of
the
building
of
old
san
francisco
when
the
finest
collection
of
humanity
on
god
earth
sir
started
this
town
and
the
water
came
up
to
the
foot
of
market
very
terrible
were
some
of
the
tales
grimly
humorous
the
others
and
the
men
in
broadcloth
and
fine
linen
who
told
them
had
played
their
parts
in
them
and
now
and
again
when
things
got
too
bad
they
would
toll
the
city
bell
and
the
vigilance
committee
turned
out
and
hanged
the
suspicious
characters
a
man
did
begin
to
be
suspected
in
those
days
till
he
had
committed
at
least
one
unprovoked
murder
said
a
portly
old
gentleman
i
looked
at
the
pictures
around
me
the
noiseless
waiter
behind
me
the
ceiling
above
the
velvet
carpet
beneath
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
even
twenty
years
ago
you
could
see
a
man
hanged
with
great
pomp
later
on
i
found
reason
to
change
my
opinion
the
tales
gave
me
a
headache
and
set
me
thinking
how
in
the
world
was
it
possible
to
take
in
even
one
thousandth
of
this
huge
roaring
continent
in
the
silence
of
the
sumptuous
library
lay
professor
bryce
book
on
the
american
republic
it
is
an
omen
said
i
he
has
done
all
things
in
all
seriousness
and
he
may
be
purchased
for
half
a
guinea
those
who
desire
information
of
the
most
undoubted
must
refer
to
his
pages
for
me
is
the
daily
round
of
vagabondage
the
recording
of
the
incidents
of
the
hour
and
intercourse
with
the
of
the
day
i
will
not
this
country
at
and
i
forgot
all
about
india
for
ten
days
while
i
went
out
to
dinners
and
watched
the
social
customs
of
the
people
which
are
entirely
different
from
our
customs
and
was
introduced
to
men
of
many
millions
these
persons
are
harmless
in
their
earlier
stages
that
is
to
say
a
man
worth
three
or
four
million
dollars
may
be
a
good
talker
clever
amusing
and
of
the
world
a
man
with
twice
that
amount
is
to
be
avoided
and
a
twenty
million
man
is
just
twenty
millions
take
an
instance
i
was
speaking
to
a
newspaper
man
about
seeing
the
proprietor
of
his
journal
as
in
my
innocence
i
supposed
newspaper
men
occasionally
did
my
friend
snorted
indignantly
see
him
great
scott
no
if
he
happens
to
appear
in
the
office
i
have
to
associate
with
him
but
thank
heaven
outside
of
that
i
move
in
circles
where
he
can
not
and
yet
the
first
thing
i
have
been
taught
to
believe
is
that
money
was
everything
in
america
ii
american
politics
i
have
been
watching
machinery
in
repose
after
reading
about
machinery
in
action
an
excellent
gentleman
who
bears
a
name
honored
in
the
magazine
writes
much
as
disraeli
orated
of
the
sublime
instincts
of
an
ancient
people
the
certainty
with
which
they
can
be
trusted
to
manage
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
way
and
the
speed
with
which
they
are
making
for
all
sorts
of
desirable
goals
this
he
called
a
statement
or
purview
of
american
politics
i
went
almost
directly
afterward
to
a
saloon
where
gentlemen
interested
in
ward
politics
nightly
congregate
they
were
not
pretty
persons
some
of
them
were
bloated
and
they
all
swore
cheerfully
till
the
heavy
gold
on
their
fat
stomachs
rose
and
fell
again
but
they
talked
over
their
liquor
as
men
who
had
power
and
unquestioned
access
to
places
of
trust
and
profit
the
magazine
writer
discussed
theories
of
government
these
men
the
practice
they
had
been
there
they
knew
all
about
it
they
banged
their
fists
on
the
table
and
spoke
of
political
pulls
the
vending
of
votes
and
so
forth
theirs
was
not
the
talk
of
village
babblers
reconstructing
the
affairs
of
the
nation
but
of
strong
coarse
lustful
men
fighting
for
spoil
and
thoroughly
understanding
the
best
methods
of
reaching
it
i
listened
long
and
intently
to
speech
i
could
not
understand
or
but
in
spots
it
was
the
speech
of
business
however
i
had
sense
enough
to
know
that
and
to
do
my
laughing
outside
the
door
then
i
began
to
understand
why
my
pleasant
and
hosts
in
san
francisco
spoke
with
a
bitter
scorn
of
such
duties
of
citizenship
as
voting
and
taking
an
interest
in
the
distribution
of
offices
scores
of
men
have
told
me
without
false
pride
that
they
would
as
soon
concern
themselves
with
the
public
affairs
of
the
city
or
state
as
rake
muck
with
a
it
may
be
that
their
lofty
disdain
covers
selfishness
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
habitually
to
meet
the
fat
gentlemen
with
shiny
and
plump
cigars
in
whose
society
i
have
been
spending
the
evening
read
about
politics
as
the
cultured
writer
of
the
magazine
regards
and
then
and
not
till
then
pay
your
respects
to
the
gentlemen
who
run
the
grimy
reality
i
sick
of
interviewing
night
editors
who
lean
their
chair
against
the
wall
and
in
response
to
my
demand
for
the
record
of
a
prominent
citizen
answer
well
you
see
he
began
by
keeping
a
saloon
etc
i
prefer
to
believe
that
my
informants
are
treating
me
as
in
the
old
sinful
days
in
india
i
was
used
to
treat
the
wandering
they
declare
that
they
speak
the
truth
and
the
news
of
dog
politics
lately
vouchsafed
to
me
in
groggeries
inclines
me
to
believe
but
i
wo
the
people
are
much
too
nice
to
slangander
as
recklessly
as
i
have
been
doing
besides
i
am
hopelessly
in
love
with
about
eight
american
maidens
all
perfectly
delightful
till
the
next
one
comes
into
the
room
was
a
darling
but
she
lacked
several
things
conversation
for
one
you
can
not
live
on
giggles
she
shall
remain
unmarried
at
nagasaki
while
i
roast
a
battered
heart
before
the
shrine
of
a
big
kentucky
blonde
who
had
for
a
nurse
when
she
was
little
a
negro
by
consequence
she
has
welded
on
california
beauty
paris
dresses
eastern
culture
europe
trips
and
wild
western
originality
the
queer
dreamy
superstitions
of
the
quarters
and
the
result
is
and
she
is
but
one
of
many
stars
item
a
maiden
who
believes
in
education
and
possesses
it
with
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
boot
and
a
taste
for
slumming
item
the
leader
of
a
sort
of
informal
salon
where
girls
congregate
read
papers
and
daringly
discuss
metaphysical
problems
and
candy
a
imperious
maiden
she
item
a
very
small
maiden
absolutely
without
reverence
who
can
in
one
swift
sentence
trample
upon
and
leave
gasping
half
a
dozen
young
men
item
a
millionairess
burdened
with
her
money
lonely
caustic
with
a
tongue
keen
as
a
sword
yearning
for
a
sphere
but
chained
up
to
the
rock
of
her
vast
possessions
item
a
typewriter
maiden
earning
her
own
bread
in
this
big
city
because
she
does
think
a
girl
ought
to
be
a
burden
on
her
parents
who
quotes
theophile
gautier
and
moves
through
the
world
manfully
much
respected
for
all
her
twenty
inexperienced
summers
item
a
woman
from
who
has
no
history
in
the
past
or
future
but
is
discreetly
of
the
present
and
strives
for
the
confidences
of
male
humanity
on
the
grounds
of
sympathy
methinks
this
is
not
altogether
a
new
type
item
a
girl
in
a
dive
blessed
with
a
greek
head
and
eyes
that
seem
to
speak
all
that
is
best
and
sweetest
in
the
world
but
woe
is
me
she
has
no
ideas
in
this
world
or
the
next
beyond
the
consumption
of
beer
a
commission
on
each
bottle
and
protests
that
she
sings
the
songs
allotted
to
her
nightly
without
more
than
the
vaguest
notion
of
their
meaning
sweet
and
comely
are
the
maidens
of
devonshire
delicate
and
of
gracious
seeming
those
who
live
in
the
pleasant
places
of
london
fascinating
for
all
their
demureness
the
damsels
of
france
clinging
closely
to
their
mothers
with
large
eyes
wondering
at
the
wicked
world
excellent
in
her
own
place
and
to
those
who
understand
her
is
the
spin
in
her
second
season
but
the
girls
of
america
are
above
and
beyond
them
all
they
are
clever
they
can
talk
yea
it
is
said
that
they
think
certainly
they
have
an
appearance
of
so
doing
which
is
delightfully
deceptive
they
are
original
and
regard
you
between
the
brows
with
unabashed
eyes
as
a
sister
might
look
at
her
brother
they
are
instructed
too
in
the
folly
and
vanity
of
the
male
mind
for
they
have
associated
with
the
boys
from
babyhood
and
can
discerningly
minister
to
both
vices
or
pleasantly
snub
the
possessor
they
possess
moreover
a
life
among
themselves
independent
of
any
masculine
associations
they
have
societies
and
clubs
and
unlimited
where
all
the
guests
are
girls
they
are
without
parting
with
any
tenderness
that
is
their
they
understand
they
can
take
care
of
themselves
they
are
superbly
independent
when
you
ask
them
what
makes
them
so
charming
they
say
it
is
because
we
are
better
educated
than
your
girls
and
and
we
are
more
sensible
in
regard
to
men
we
have
good
times
all
round
but
we
are
taught
to
regard
every
man
as
a
possible
husband
nor
is
he
expected
to
marry
the
first
girl
he
calls
on
yes
they
have
good
times
their
freedom
is
large
and
they
do
not
abuse
it
they
can
go
driving
with
young
men
and
receive
visits
from
young
men
to
an
extent
that
would
make
an
english
mother
wink
with
horror
and
neither
driver
nor
drivee
has
a
thought
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
a
good
time
as
certain
also
of
their
own
poets
have
said
man
is
fire
and
woman
is
tow
and
the
devil
he
comes
and
begins
to
in
america
the
tow
is
soaked
in
a
solution
that
makes
it
in
absolute
liberty
and
large
knowledge
consequently
accidents
do
not
exceed
the
regular
percentage
arranged
by
the
devil
for
each
class
and
climate
under
the
skies
but
the
freedom
of
the
young
girl
has
its
drawbacks
she
is
i
say
it
with
all
reluctance
irreverent
from
her
bonnet
to
the
buckles
in
her
shoes
she
talks
flippantly
to
her
parents
and
men
old
enough
to
be
her
grandfather
she
has
a
prescriptive
right
to
the
society
of
the
man
who
arrives
the
parents
admit
it
this
is
sometimes
embarrassing
especially
when
you
call
on
a
man
and
his
wife
for
the
sake
of
information
the
one
being
a
merchant
of
varied
knowledge
the
other
a
woman
of
the
world
in
five
minutes
your
host
has
vanished
in
another
five
his
wife
has
followed
him
and
you
are
left
alone
with
a
very
charming
maiden
doubtless
but
certainly
not
the
person
you
came
to
see
she
chatters
and
you
grin
but
you
leave
with
the
very
strong
impression
of
a
wasted
morning
this
has
been
my
experience
once
or
twice
i
have
even
said
as
pointedly
as
i
dared
to
a
man
i
came
to
see
you
better
see
me
in
my
office
then
the
house
belongs
to
my
women
folk
to
my
daughter
that
is
to
he
spoke
the
truth
the
american
of
wealth
is
owned
by
his
family
they
exploit
him
for
bullion
the
women
get
the
the
kicks
are
all
his
own
nothing
is
too
good
for
an
american
daughter
i
speak
here
of
the
moneyed
classes
the
girls
take
every
gift
as
a
matter
of
course
and
yet
they
develop
greatly
when
a
catastrophe
arrives
and
the
man
of
many
millions
goes
up
or
goes
down
and
his
daughters
take
to
stenography
or
typewriting
i
have
heard
many
tales
of
heroism
from
the
lips
of
girls
who
counted
the
principals
among
their
friends
the
crash
came
mamie
or
hattie
or
sadie
gave
up
their
maid
their
carriages
and
candy
and
with
a
no
remington
and
a
stout
heart
set
about
earning
their
daily
bread
and
did
i
drop
her
from
the
list
of
my
friends
no
sir
said
a
vision
in
white
lace
that
might
happen
to
us
any
it
may
be
this
sense
of
possible
disaster
in
the
air
that
makes
san
francisco
society
go
with
so
captivating
a
rush
and
whirl
recklessness
is
in
the
air
i
ca
explain
where
it
comes
from
but
there
it
is
the
roaring
winds
of
the
pacific
make
you
drunk
to
begin
with
the
aggressive
luxury
on
all
sides
helps
out
the
intoxication
and
you
spin
forever
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
there
is
no
small
change
by
the
way
west
of
the
rockies
as
long
as
money
lasts
they
make
greatly
and
they
spend
lavishly
not
only
the
rich
but
the
artisans
who
pay
nearly
five
pounds
for
a
suit
of
clothes
and
for
other
luxuries
in
proportion
the
young
men
rejoice
in
the
days
of
their
youth
they
gamble
yacht
race
enjoy
and
the
one
openly
the
other
in
secret
they
establish
luxurious
clubs
they
break
themselves
over
and
other
things
and
they
are
instant
in
a
quarrel
at
twenty
they
are
experienced
in
business
embark
in
vast
enterprises
take
partners
as
experienced
as
themselves
and
go
to
pieces
with
as
much
splendor
as
their
neighbors
remember
that
the
men
who
stocked
california
in
the
fifties
were
physically
and
as
far
as
regards
certain
tough
virtues
the
pick
of
the
earth
the
inept
and
the
weakly
died
en
route
or
went
under
in
the
days
of
construction
to
this
nucleus
were
added
all
the
races
of
the
continent
french
italian
german
and
of
course
the
jew
the
result
you
can
see
in
the
women
and
long
elastic
boys
it
needs
no
little
golden
badge
swinging
from
the
to
mark
the
native
son
of
the
golden
west
the
of
california
him
i
love
because
he
is
devoid
of
fear
carries
himself
like
a
man
and
has
a
heart
as
big
as
his
books
i
fancy
too
he
knows
how
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
life
that
his
province
so
abundantly
bestows
upon
him
at
least
i
heard
a
little
rat
of
a
creature
with
shoulders
explaining
that
a
man
from
chicago
could
pull
the
of
a
californian
in
business
well
if
i
lived
in
where
cherries
were
as
big
as
plums
plums
as
big
as
apples
and
strawberries
of
no
account
where
the
procession
of
the
fruits
of
the
seasons
was
like
a
pageant
in
a
drury
lane
pantomime
and
the
dry
air
was
wine
i
should
let
business
slide
once
in
a
way
and
kick
up
my
heels
with
my
fellows
the
tale
of
the
resources
of
california
vegetable
and
mineral
is
a
you
can
read
it
in
books
you
would
never
believe
me
all
manner
of
nourishing
food
from
to
beef
may
be
bought
at
the
lowest
prices
and
the
people
are
consequently
and
of
a
high
stomach
they
demand
ten
shillings
for
tinkering
a
jammed
lock
of
a
trunk
they
receive
sixteen
shillings
a
day
for
working
as
carpenters
they
spend
many
sixpences
on
very
bad
cigars
which
the
poorest
of
them
smoke
and
they
go
mad
over
a
when
they
disagree
they
do
so
fatally
with
in
their
hands
and
on
the
public
streets
i
was
just
clear
of
mission
street
when
the
trouble
began
between
two
gentlemen
one
of
whom
perforated
the
other
when
a
policeman
whose
name
i
do
not
recollect
fatally
shot
ed
hearney
for
attempting
to
escape
arrest
i
was
in
the
next
street
for
these
things
i
am
thankful
it
is
enough
to
travel
with
a
policeman
in
a
and
while
he
arranges
his
as
he
sits
down
to
catch
sight
of
a
loaded
revolver
it
is
enough
to
know
that
fifty
per
cent
of
the
men
in
the
public
saloons
carry
pistols
about
them
the
chinaman
waylays
his
adversary
and
methodically
chops
him
to
pieces
with
his
hatchet
then
the
press
roars
about
the
brutal
ferocity
of
the
pagan
the
italian
reconstructs
his
friend
with
a
long
knife
the
press
complains
of
the
waywardness
of
the
alien
the
irishman
and
the
native
californian
in
their
hours
of
discontent
use
the
revolver
not
once
but
six
times
the
press
records
the
fact
and
asks
in
the
next
column
whether
the
world
can
parallel
the
progress
of
san
francisco
the
american
who
loves
his
country
will
tell
you
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
confined
to
the
lower
classes
just
at
present
an
who
was
sent
to
jail
by
another
judge
upon
my
word
i
can
not
tell
whether
these
titles
mean
anything
is
breathing
vengeance
against
his
enemy
the
papers
have
interviewed
both
parties
and
confidently
expect
a
fatal
issue
now
let
me
draw
breath
and
curse
the
negro
waiter
and
through
him
the
negro
in
service
generally
he
has
been
made
a
citizen
with
a
vote
consequently
both
political
parties
play
with
him
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
will
commit
in
one
meal
every
betise
that
a
senllion
fresh
from
the
is
capable
of
and
he
will
continue
to
repeat
those
faults
he
is
as
complete
a
uncomprehending
fool
as
any
in
the
east
ever
took
into
her
establishment
but
he
is
according
to
law
a
free
and
independent
citizen
consequently
above
reproof
or
criticism
he
and
he
alone
in
this
insane
city
will
wait
at
table
the
chinaman
does
count
he
is
untrained
inept
but
he
will
fill
the
place
and
draw
the
pay
now
god
and
his
father
fate
made
him
intellectually
inferior
to
the
oriental
he
insists
on
pretending
that
he
serves
tables
by
accident
as
a
sort
of
amusement
he
wishes
you
to
understand
this
little
fact
you
wish
to
eat
your
meals
and
if
possible
to
have
them
properly
served
he
is
a
big
black
vain
baby
and
a
man
rolled
into
one
a
colored
gentleman
who
insisted
on
getting
me
pie
when
i
wanted
something
else
demanded
information
about
india
i
gave
him
some
facts
about
wages
oh
hell
said
he
cheerfully
that
would
keep
me
in
cigars
for
a
then
he
fawned
on
me
for
a
piece
later
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
pity
the
natives
of
india
heathens
he
called
them
this
woolly
one
whose
race
has
been
the
butt
of
every
comedy
on
the
native
stage
since
the
beginning
and
i
turned
and
saw
by
the
head
upon
his
shoulders
that
he
was
a
yoruba
man
if
there
be
any
truth
in
ethnological
castes
he
did
his
thinking
in
english
but
he
was
a
yoruba
negro
and
the
race
type
had
remained
the
same
throughout
his
generations
and
the
room
was
full
of
other
races
some
that
looked
exactly
like
gallas
but
the
trade
was
never
recruited
from
that
side
of
africa
some
duplicates
of
cameroon
heads
and
some
kroomen
if
ever
kroomen
wore
evening
dress
the
american
does
not
consider
little
matters
of
descent
though
by
this
time
he
ought
to
know
all
about
damnable
as
a
general
rule
he
keeps
himself
very
far
from
the
negro
and
says
things
about
him
that
are
not
pretty
there
are
six
million
negroes
more
or
less
in
the
states
and
they
are
increasing
the
american
once
having
made
them
citizens
can
not
unmake
them
he
says
in
his
newspapers
they
ought
to
be
elevated
by
education
he
is
trying
this
but
it
is
likely
to
be
a
long
job
because
black
blood
is
much
more
adhesive
than
white
and
throws
back
with
annoying
persistence
when
the
negro
gets
religion
he
returns
directly
as
a
hiving
bee
to
the
first
instincts
of
his
people
just
now
a
wave
of
religion
is
sweeping
over
some
of
the
southern
states
up
to
the
present
two
messiahs
and
a
daniel
have
appeared
and
several
human
sacrifices
have
been
offered
up
to
these
incarnations
the
daniel
managed
to
get
three
young
men
who
he
insisted
were
shadrach
meshach
and
abednego
to
walk
into
a
blast
furnace
guaranteeing
they
did
not
return
i
have
seen
nothing
of
this
kind
but
i
have
attended
a
negro
church
they
pray
or
are
caused
to
pray
by
themselves
in
this
country
the
congregation
were
moved
by
the
spirit
to
groans
and
tears
and
one
of
them
danced
up
the
aisle
to
the
mourners
bench
the
motive
may
have
been
genuine
the
movements
of
the
shaken
body
were
those
of
a
zanzibar
stick
dance
such
as
you
see
at
aden
on
the
and
even
as
i
watched
the
people
the
links
that
bound
them
to
the
white
man
snapped
one
by
one
and
i
saw
before
me
the
hubshi
woolly
hair
praying
to
a
god
he
did
not
understand
those
neatly
dressed
folk
on
the
benches
and
the
elder
by
the
window
were
savages
neither
more
nor
less
what
will
the
american
do
with
the
negro
the
south
will
not
consort
with
him
in
some
states
miscegenation
is
a
penal
offence
the
north
is
every
year
less
and
less
in
need
of
his
services
and
he
will
not
disappear
he
will
continue
as
a
problem
his
friends
will
urge
that
he
is
as
good
as
the
white
man
his
enemies
well
you
can
guess
what
his
enemies
will
do
from
a
little
incident
that
followed
on
a
recent
appointment
by
the
president
he
made
a
negro
an
assistant
in
a
where
think
of
it
he
had
to
work
at
the
next
desk
to
a
white
girl
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
one
of
the
first
families
of
georgia
modern
chivalry
and
all
the
weary
weary
rest
of
it
the
southern
chivalry
howled
and
hanged
or
burned
some
one
in
effigy
perhaps
it
was
the
president
and
perhaps
it
was
the
negro
but
the
principle
remains
the
same
they
said
it
was
an
insult
it
is
not
good
to
be
a
negro
in
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
but
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
san
francisco
and
her
merry
maidens
her
strong
swaggering
men
and
her
wealth
of
gold
and
pride
they
bore
me
to
a
banquet
in
honor
of
a
brave
lieutenant
carlin
of
the
vandalia
who
stuck
by
his
ship
in
the
great
cyclone
at
apia
and
comported
himself
as
an
officer
should
on
that
occasion
was
at
the
bohemian
club
i
heard
oratory
with
the
roundest
of
o
and
devoured
a
dinner
the
memory
of
which
will
descend
with
me
into
the
hungry
grave
there
were
about
forty
speeches
delivered
and
not
one
of
them
was
average
or
ordinary
it
was
my
first
introduction
to
the
american
eagle
screaming
for
all
it
was
worth
the
lieutenant
heroism
served
as
a
peg
from
which
the
ones
turned
themselves
loose
and
kicked
they
ransacked
the
clouds
of
sunset
the
thunderbolts
of
heaven
the
deeps
of
hell
and
the
splendor
of
the
resurrection
for
tropes
and
metaphors
and
hurled
the
result
at
the
head
of
the
guest
of
the
evening
never
since
the
morning
stars
sung
together
for
joy
i
learned
had
an
amazed
creation
witnessed
such
superhuman
bravery
as
that
displayed
by
the
american
navy
in
the
samoa
cyclone
till
earth
rotted
in
the
phosphorescent
slime
of
a
decayed
universe
that
gallantry
would
not
be
forgotten
i
grieve
that
i
can
not
give
the
exact
words
my
attempt
at
reproducing
their
spirit
is
pale
and
inadequate
i
sat
bewildered
on
a
coruscating
niagara
of
it
was
magnificent
it
was
stupendous
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
wicked
desire
to
hide
my
face
in
a
napkin
and
grin
then
according
to
rule
they
produced
their
dead
and
across
the
snowy
tablecloths
dragged
the
corpse
of
every
man
slain
in
the
civil
war
and
hurled
defiance
at
our
natural
enemy
england
so
please
you
with
her
chain
of
fortresses
across
the
thereafter
they
glorified
their
nation
afresh
from
the
beginning
in
case
any
detail
should
have
been
overlooked
and
that
made
me
uncomfortable
for
their
sakes
how
in
the
world
can
a
white
man
a
sahib
of
our
blood
stand
up
and
plaster
praise
on
his
own
country
he
can
think
as
highly
as
he
likes
but
this
vehemence
of
adoration
struck
me
almost
as
indelicate
my
hosts
talked
for
rather
more
than
three
hours
and
at
the
end
seemed
ready
for
three
hours
more
but
when
the
lieutenant
such
a
big
brave
gentle
giant
rose
to
his
feet
he
delivered
what
seemed
to
me
as
the
speech
of
the
evening
i
remember
nearly
the
whole
of
it
and
it
ran
something
in
this
way
gentlemen
it
very
good
of
you
to
give
me
this
dinner
and
to
tell
me
all
these
but
what
i
want
you
to
understand
the
fact
is
what
we
want
and
what
we
ought
to
get
at
once
is
a
navy
more
ships
lots
of
then
we
howled
the
top
of
the
roof
off
and
i
for
one
fell
in
love
with
carlin
on
the
spot
wallah
he
was
a
man
the
prince
among
merchants
bid
me
take
no
heed
to
the
warlike
sentiments
of
some
of
the
old
generals
the
are
thrown
in
for
effect
quoth
he
and
whenever
we
get
on
our
hind
legs
we
always
express
a
desire
to
chaw
up
england
a
sort
of
family
and
indeed
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
no
other
country
for
the
american
public
speaker
to
trample
upon
france
has
germany
we
have
russia
for
italy
austria
is
provided
and
the
humblest
pathan
possesses
an
ancestral
enemy
only
america
stands
out
of
the
racket
and
therefore
to
be
in
fashion
makes
a
of
the
mother
country
and
hangs
her
when
occasion
requires
the
chain
of
fortresses
man
a
fascinating
talker
explained
to
me
after
the
affair
that
he
was
compelled
to
blow
off
steam
everybody
expected
it
when
we
had
chanted
the
star
spangled
banner
not
more
than
eight
times
we
adjourned
america
is
a
very
great
country
but
it
is
not
yet
heaven
with
electric
lights
and
plush
fittings
as
the
speakers
professed
to
believe
my
listening
mind
went
back
to
the
politicians
in
the
saloon
who
wasted
no
time
in
talking
about
freedom
but
quietly
made
arrangements
to
impose
their
will
on
the
citizens
the
judge
is
a
great
man
but
give
thy
presents
to
the
clerk
as
the
proverb
saith
and
what
more
remains
to
tell
i
can
not
write
connectedly
because
i
am
in
love
with
all
those

aforesaid

some
others
who
do
not
appear

an
institution

which
the
comic
papers

convenient

and
a
companion
rent
a
room
in
a
business
quarter

aided
by
a
typewriting
machine

at
the
rate

only
a
woman
can
operate

typewriting
machine

she
has
served
apprenticeship
to
the
sewing
machine
she
can
earn
as
much
as
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
and
professes
to
regard
this
form
of
as
her
natural
destiny
but
oh
how
she
hates
it
in
her
heart
of
hearts
when
i
had
got
over
the
surprise
of
doing
business
with
and
trying
to
give
orders
to
a
young
woman
of
coldly
clerkly
aspect
intrenched
behind
spectacles
i
made
inquiries
concerning
the
pleasures
of
this
independence
they
liked
it
indeed
they
did
was
the
natural
fate
of
almost
all
girls
the
recognized
custom
in
america
and
i
was
a
barbarian
not
to
see
it
in
that
light
well
and
after
said
i
what
happens
we
work
for
our
and
then
what
do
you
expect
then
we
shall
work
for
our
till
you
die
unless
unless
what
this
is
your
business
you
know
a
man
works
until
he
so
shall
we
this
without
enthusiasm
i
said
the
partner
in
the
firm
audaciously
sometimes
we
marry
our
employees
at
least
that
what
the
newspapers
the
hand
banged
on
half
a
dozen
of
the
keys
of
the
machine
at
once
yet
i
do
care
i
hate
it
i
hate
it
i
hate
it
and
you
need
look
so
the
senior
partner
was
regarding
the
rebel
with
reproach
i
thought
you
did
said
i
i
do
suppose
american
girls
are
much
different
from
english
ones
in
is
it
theophile
gautier
who
says
that
the
only
difference
between
country
and
country
lie
in
the
slang
and
the
uniform
of
the
police
now
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
at
once
what
is
one
to
say
to
a
young
lady
who
in
england
would
be
a
person
who
earns
her
own
bread
and
very
naturally
hates
the
employ
and
slings
quotations
at
your
head
that
one
falls
in
love
with
her
goes
without
saying
but
that
is
not
enough
a
mission
should
be
established

american

the

nor

time
and
chance
cometh
to
all
i
have
lived
the
american
continent
may
now
sink
under

for
i
have
taken
the
best
that
it
yields

the
best
was

now
gentlemen
of
the
punjab

club
who
whip
the
reaches
of
the
tavi

you
who
painfully
import
trout
over
to

i
will
tell
you
how
old
man
california
and
i
went
fishing
and
you
shall
envy
we
returned
from
the
dalles
to
portland
by
the
way
we
had
come
the
steamer
stopping
en
route
to
pick
up
a
night
catch
of
one
of
the
salmon
wheels
on
the
river
and
to
deliver
it
at
a
cannery
downstream
when
the
proprietor
of
the
wheel
announced
that
his
take
was
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
weight
of
fish
and
not
a
heavy
catch
neither
i
thought
he
lied
but
he
sent
the
boxes
aboard
and
i
counted
the
salmon
by
the
hundred
huge
hardly
dead
scores
of
twenty
and
thirty
pounders
and
a
host
of
smaller
fish
they
were
all
chenook
salmon
as
distinguished
from
the
steel
head
and
the
silver
that
is
to
say
they
were
royal
salmon
and
california
and
i
dropped
a
tear
over
them
as
monarchs
who
deserved
a
better
fate
but
the
lust
of
slaughter
entered
into
our
souls
and
we
talked
fish
and
forgot
the
mountain
scenery
that
had
so
moved
us
a
day
before
the
steamer
halted
at
a
rude
wooden
warehouse
built
on
piles
in
a
lonely
reach
of
the
river
and
sent
in
the
fish
i
followed
them
up
a
fishy
incline
that
led
to
the
cannery
the
crazy
building
was
quivering
with
the
machinery
on
its
floors
and
a
glittering
bank
of
tin
scraps
twenty
feet
high
showed
where
the
waste
was
thrown
after
the
cans
had
been
punched
only
chinamen
were
employed
on
the
work
and
they
looked
like
yellow
devils
as
they
crossed
the
rifts
of
sunlight
that
lay
upon
the
floor
when
our
consignment
arrived
the
rough
wooden
boxes
broke
of
themselves
as
they
were
dumped
down
under
a
jet
of
water
and
the
salmon
burst
out
in
a
stream
of
quicksilver
a
chinaman
jerked
up
a
beheaded
and
detailed
it
with
two
swift
strokes
of
a
knife
flicked
out
its
internal
arrangements
with
a
third
and
case
it
into
a
tank
the
headless
fish
leaped
from
under
his
hands
as
though
they
were
facing
a
rapid
other
chinamen
pulled
them
from
the
vat
and
thrust
them
under
a
thing
like
a
which
descending
hewed
them
into
unseemly
red
gobbets
fit
for
the
can
more
chinamen
with
yellow
crooked
fingers
jammed
the
stuff
into
the
cans
which
slid
down
some
marvellous
machine
forthwith
soldering
their
own
tops
as
they
passed
each
can
was
hastily
tested
for
flaws
and
then
sunk
with
a
hundred
companions
into
a
vat
of
boiling
water
there
to
be
half
cooked
for
a
few
minutes
the
cans
bulged
slightly
after
the
operation
and
were
therefore
slidden
along
by
the
trolleyful
to
men
with
needles
and
who
vented
them
and
soldered
the
aperture
except
for
the
label
the
finest
columbia
salmon
was
ready
for
the
market
i
was
impressed
not
so
much
with
the
speed
of
the
manufacture
as
the
character
of
the
factory
inside
on
a
floor
ninety
by
forty
the
most
civilized
and
murderous
of
machinery
outside
three
footsteps
the
pines
and
the
immense
solitude
of
the
hills
our
steamer
only
stayed
twenty
minutes
at
that
place
but
i
counted
two
hundred
and
forty
finished
cans
made
from
the
catch
of
the
previous
night
ere
i
left
the
slippery
oily
floors
and
the
chinamen
we
reached
portland
california
and
i
crying
for
salmon
and
a
man
to
whom
we
had
been
intrusted
by
an
insurance
man
met
us
in
the
street
saying
that
fifteen
miles
away
across
country
we
should
come
upon
a
place
called
clackamas
where
we
might
perchance
find
what
we
desired
and
california
his
flying
in
the
wind
ran
to
a
and
chartered
a
wagon
and
team
forthwith
i
could
push
the
wagon
about
with
one
hand
so
light
was
its
structure
the
team
was
purely
american
that
is
to
say
almost
human
in
its
intelligence
and
docility
some
one
said
that
the
roads
were
not
good
on
the
way
to
clackamas
and
warned
us
against
smashing
the
springs
portland
who
had
watched
the
preparations
finally
reckoned
he
come
along
too
and
under
heavenly
skies
we
three
companions
of
a
day
set
forth
california
carefully
lashing
our
rods
into
the
carriage
and
the
overwhelming
us
with
directions
as
to
the
we
were
to
pass
the
ferries
we
were
to
cross
and
the
we
were
to
seek
signs
from
half
a
mile
from
this
city
of
fifty
thousand
souls
we
struck
and
this
must
be
taken
literally
a
plank
road
that
would
have
been
a
disgrace
to
an
irish
village
then
six
miles
of
macadamized
road
showed
us
that
the
team
could
move
a
railway
ran
between
us
and
the
banks
of
the
willamette
and
another
above
us
through
the
mountains
all
the
land
was
dotted
with
small
townships
and
the
roads
were
full
of
farmers
in
their
town
wagons
bunches
of
urchins
sitting
in
the
hay
behind
the
men
generally
looked
like
loafers
but
their
women
were
all
well
dressed
brown
braiding
on
a
jacket
does
not
however
consort
with
then
we
struck
into
the
woods
along
what
california
called
a
camina
reale
a
good
road
and
portland
a
fair
it
wound
in
and
out
among
stumps
under
along
the
corners
of
log
fences
through
hollows
which
must
be
hopeless
marsh
in
the
winter
and
up
absurd
gradients
but
nowhere
throughout
its
length
did
i
see
any
evidence
of
there
was
a
track
you
could
well
get
off
it
and
it
was
all
you
could
do
to
stay
on
it
the
dust
lay
a
foot
thick
in
the
blind
ruts
and
under
the
dust
we
found
bits
of
planking
and
bundles
of
brushwood
that
sent
the
wagon
bounding
into
the
air
the
journey
in
itself
was
a
delight
sometimes
we
crashed
through
bracken
anon
where
the
blackberries
grew
rankest
we
found
a
lonely
little
cemetery
the
wooden
rails
all
awry
and
the
pitiful
stumpy
nodding
drunkenly
at
the
soft
green
mullions
then
with
oaths
and
the
sound
of
rent
underwood
a
yoke
of
mighty
bulls
would
swing
down
a
skid
road
hauling
a
log
along
a
rudely
made
slide
a
valley
full
of
wheat
and
succeeded
and
halting
at
a
house
we
bought
weight
of
luscious
black
cherries
for
something
less
than
a
rupee
and
got
a
drink
of
water
for
nothing
while
the
untended
team
browsed
sagaciously
by
the
once
we
found
a
camp
of
lounging
by
a
pool
ready
for
a
sale
or
a
swap
and
once
two
youngsters
shot
down
a
hill
on
indian
ponies
their
full
creels
banging
from
the
saddle
they
had
been
fishing
and
were
our
brethren
therefore
we
shouted
aloud
in
chorus
to
scare
a
wild
cat
we
squabbled
over
the
reasons
that
had
led
a
snake
to
cross
a
road
we
heaved
bits
of
bark
at
a
venturesome
chipmunk
who
was
really
the
little
gray
squirrel
of
india
and
had
come
to
call
on
me
we
lost
our
way
and
got
the
wagon
so
beautifully
fixed
on
a
road
that
we
had
to
tie
the
two
hind
wheels
to
get
it
down
above
all
california
told
tales
of
nevada
and
arizona
of
lonely
nights
spent
out
prospecting
the
slaughter
of
deer
and
the
chase
of
men
of
woman
lovely
woman
who
is
a
firebrand
in
a
western
city
and
leads
to
the
popping
of
pistols
and
of
the
sudden
changes
and
chances
of
fortune
who
delights
in
making
the
miner
or
the
a
quadruplicate
millionaire
and
in
busting
the
railroad
king
that
was
a
day
to
be
remembered
and
it
had
only
begun
when
we
drew
rein
at
a
tiny
on
the
banks
of
the
clackamas
and
sought
horse
feed
and
lodging
ere
we
hastened
to
the
river
that
broke
over
a
weir
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
imagine
a
stream
seventy
yards
broad
divided
by
a
pebbly
island
running
over
seductive
riffles
and
swirling
into
deep
quiet
pools
where
the
good
salmon
goes
to
smoke
his
pipe
after
meals
get
such
a
stream
amid
fields
of
crops
surrounded
by
hills
of
pines
throw
in
where
you
please
quiet
water
meadows
and
a
bluff
just
to
keep
the
scenery
from
growing
too
monotonous
and
you
will
get
some
faint
notion
of
the
clackamas
the
weir
had
been
erected
to
pen
the
chenook
salmon
from
going
further
we
could
see
them
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
by
the
score
in
the
deep
pools
or
flying
madly
against
the
weir
and
foolishly
skinning
their
noses
they
were
not
our
prey
for
they
would
not
rise
at
a
fly
and
we
knew
it
all
the
same
when
one
made
his
leap
against
the
weir
and
landed
on
the
with
a
jar
that
shook
the
board
i
was
standing
on
i
would
fain
have
claimed
him
for
my
own
capture
portland
had
no
rod
he
held
the
gaff
and
the
whiskey
california
sniffed
and
across
the
racing
water
chose
his
ground
and
let
the
gaudy
fly
drop
in
the
tail
of
a
riffle
i
was
getting
my
rod
together
when
i
heard
the
joyous
shriek
of
the
reel
and
the
yells
of
california
and
three
feet
of
living
silver
leaped
into
the
air
far
across
the
water
the
forces
were
engaged
the
salmon
tore
the
tense
line
cutting
the
water
like
a
behind
him
and
the
light
bamboo
bowed
to
breaking
what
happened
thereafter
i
can
not
tell
california
swore
and
prayed
and
portland
shouted
advice
and
i
did
all
three
for
what
appeared
to
be
half
a
day
but
was
in
reality
a
little
over
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
sullenly
our
fish
came
home
with
spurts
of
temper
dashes
head
on
and
sarabands
in
the
air
but
home
to
the
bank
came
he
and
the
remorseless
reel
gathered
up
the
thread
of
his
life
inch
by
inch
we
landed
him
in
a
little
bay
and
the
spring
weight
in
his
gorgeous
gills
checked
at
eleven
and
one
half
pounds
eleven
and
one
half
pounds
of
fighting
salmon
we
danced
a
on
the
pebbles
and
california
caught
me
round
the
waist
in
a
hug
that
went
near
to
breaking
my
ribs
while
he
shouted
partner
partner
this
is
glory
now
you
catch
your
fish
years
i
waited
for
this
i
went
into
that
river
and
made
my
cast
just
above
the
weir
and
all
but
a
with
a
coral
mouth
who
coiled
herself
on
a
stone
and
hissed
the
next
cast
ah
the
pride
of
it
the
regal
splendor
of
it
the
thrill
that
ran
down
from
to
toe
then
the
water
boiled
he
broke
for
the
fly
and
got
it
there
remained
enough
sense
in
me
to
give
him
all
he
wanted
when
he
jumped
not
once
but
twenty
times
before
the
flight
that
ran
my
line
out
to
the
last
turns
and
i
saw
the
nickelled
glitter
under
the
thinning
green
coils
my
thumb
was
burned
deep
when
i
strove
to
stopper
the
line
i
did
not
feel
it
till
later
for
my
soul
was
out
in
the
dancing
weir
praying
for
him
to
turn
ere
he
took
my
tackle
away
and
the
prayer
was
heard
as
i
bowed
back
the
butt
of
the
rod
on
my
left
and
the
top
joint
dipping
like
unto
a
weeping
willow
he
turned
and
accepted
each
inch
of
slack
that
i
could
by
any
means
get
in
as
a
favor
from
on
high
there
lie
several
sorts
of
success
in
this
world
that
taste
well
in
the
moment
of
enjoyment
but
i
question
whether
the
stealthy
theft
of
line
from
an
salmon
who
knows
exactly
what
you
are
doing
and
why
you
are
doing
it
is
not
sweeter
than
any
other
victory
within
human
scope
like
california
fish
he
ran
at
me
head
on
and
leaped
against
the
line
but
the
lord
gave
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
pairs
of
fingers
in
that
hour
the
banks
and
the
danced
dizzily
round
me
but
i
only
reeled
reeled
as
for
life
reeled
for
hours
and
at
the
end
of
the
reeling
continued
to
give
him
the
butt
while
he
sulked
in
a
pool
california
was
further
up
the
reach
and
with
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
could
see
him
casting
with
long
casts
and
much
skill
then
he
struck
and
my
fish
broke
for
the
weir
in
the
same
instant
and
down
the
reach
we
came
california
and
i
reel
answering
reel
even
as
the
morning
stars
sing
together
the
first
wild
enthusiasm
of
capture
had
died
away
we
were
both
at
work
now
in
deadly
earnest
to
prevent
the
lines
fouling
to
stall
off
a
rush
for
shaggy
water
just
above
the
weir
and
at
the
same
time
to
get
the
fish
into
the
shallow
bay
that
gave
the
best
practicable
landing
portland
bid
us
both
be
of
good
heart
and
volunteered
to
take
the
rod
from
my
hands
i
would
rather
have
died
among
the
pebbles
than
surrender
my
right
to
play
and
land
a
salmon
weight
unknown
with
an
rod
i
heard
california
at
my
ear
it
seemed
gasping
he
a
fighter
from
fightersville
sure
as
his
fish
made
a
fresh
break
across
the
stream
i
saw
portland
fall
off
a
log
fence
break
the
overhanging
bank
and
clatter
down
to
the
pebbles
all
sand
and
and
i
dropped
on
a
log
to
rest
for
a
moment
as
i
drew
breath
the
weary
hands
slackened
their
hold
and
i
forgot
to
give
him
the
butt
a
wild
scutter
in
the
water
a
plunge
and
a
break
for
the
of
the
clackamas
was
my
reward
and
the
weary
toil
of
reeling
in
with
one
eye
under
the
water
and
the
other
on
the
top
joint
of
the
rod
was
renewed
worst
of
all
i
was
blocking
california
path
to
the
little
landing
bay
aforesaid
and
he
had
to
halt
and
tire
his
prize
where
he
was
the
father
of
all
the
salmon
he
shouted
for
the
love
of
heaven
get
your
trout
to
bank
johnny
bull
but
i
could
do
no
more
even
the
insult
failed
to
move
me
the
rest
of
the
game
was
with
the
salmon
he
suffered
himself
to
be
drawn
with
pretended
delight
at
getting
to
the
haven
where
i
would
fain
bring
him
yet
no
sooner
did
he
feel
shoal
water
under
his
ponderous
belly
than
he
backed
like
a
and
the
snarl
of
the
reel
told
me
that
my
labor
was
in
vain
a
dozen
times
at
least
this
happened
ere
the
line
hinted
he
had
given
up
the
battle
and
would
be
towed
in
he
was
towed
the
was
useless
for
one
of
his
size
and
i
would
not
have
him
gaffed
i
stepped
into
the
shallows
and
heaved
him
out
with
a
respectful
hand
under
the
gill
for
which
kindness
he
battered
me
about
the
legs
with
his
tail
and
i
felt
the
strength
of
him
and
was
proud
california
had
taken
my
place
in
the
shallows
his
fish
hard
held
i
was
up
the
bank
lying
full
length
on
the
grass
and
gasping
in
company
with
my
first
salmon
caught
played
and
landed
on
an
rod
my
hands
were
cut
and
bleeding
i
was
dripping
with
sweat
spangled
like
a
harlequin
with
scales
water
from
my
waist
down
nose
peeled
by
the
sun
but
utterly
supremely
and
consummately
happy
the
beauty
the
darling
the
daisy
my
salmon
bahadur
weighed
twelve
pounds
and
i
had
been
minutes
bringing
him
to
bank
he
had
been
lightly
hooked
on
the
angle
of
the
right
jaw
and
the
hook
had
not
wearied
him
that
hour
i
sat
among
princes
and
crowned
heads
greater
than
them
all
below
the
bank
we
heard
california
scuffling
with
his
salmon
and
swearing
spanish
oaths
portland
and
i
assisted
at
the
capture
and
the
fish
dragged
the
spring
balance
out
by
the
roots
it
was
only
constructed
to
weigh
up
to
fifteen
pounds
we
stretched
the
three
fish
on
the
grass
the
eleven
and
a
half
the
twelve
and
fifteen
pounder
and
we
gave
an
oath
that
all
who
came
after
should
merely
be
weighed
and
put
back
again
how
shall
i
tell
the
glories
of
that
day
so
that
you
may
be
interested
again
and
again
did
california
and
i
prance
down
that
reach
to
the
little
bay
each
with
a
salmon
in
tow
and
land
him
in
the
shallows
then
portland
took
my
rod
and
caught
some
and
my
spoon
was
carried
away
by
an
unknown
leviathan
each
fish
for
the
merits
of
the
three
that
had
died
so
gamely
was
hastily
hooked
on
the
balance
and
flung
back
portland
recorded
the
weight
in
a
for
he
was
a
man
each
fish
fought
for
all
he
was
worth
and
none
more
savagely
than
the
smallest
a
game
little
at
the
end
of
six
hours
we
added
up
the
list
read
it
total
sixteen
fish
aggregate
weight
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
the
score
in
detail
runs
something
like
this
it
is
only
interesting
to
those
concerned
fifteen
eleven
and
a
half
twelve
ten
nine
and
three
quarters
eight
and
so
forth
as
i
have
said
nothing
under
six
pounds
and
three
very
solemnly
and
thankfully
we
put
up
our
rods
it
was
glory
enough
for
all
time
and
returned
weeping
in
each
other
arms
weeping
tears
of
pure
joy
to
that
simple
family
in
the
house
by
the
the
old
farmer
recollected
days
and
nights
of
fierce
warfare
with
the
indians
way
back
in
the
fifties
when
every
ripple
of
the
columbia
river
and
her
tributaries
hid
covert
danger
god
had
dowered
him
with
a
queer
crooked
gift
of
expression
and
a
fierce
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
his
two
little
sons
tanned
and
reserved
children
who
attended
school
daily
and
spoke
good
english
in
a
strange
tongue
his
wife
was
an
austere
woman
who
had
once
been
kindly
and
perhaps
handsome
very
many
years
of
toil
had
taken
the
elasticity
out
of
step
and
voice
she
looked
for
nothing
better
than
everlasting
work
the
chafing
detail
of
housework
and
then
a
grave
somewhere
up
the
hill
among
the
blackberries
and
the
pines
but
in
her
grim
way
she
sympathized
with
her
eldest
daughter
a
small
and
silent
maiden
of
eighteen
who
had
thoughts
very
far
from
the
meals
she
tended
and
the
pans
she
scoured
we
stumbled
into
the
household
at
a
crisis
and
there
was
a
deal
of
downright
humanity
in
that
same
a
bad
wicked
had
promised
the
maiden
a
dress
in
time
for
a
journey
and
though
the
barefooted
georgy
who
stood
in
very
wholesome
awe
of
his
sister
had
scoured
the
woods
on
a
pony
in
search
that
dress
never
arrived
so
with
sorrow
in
her
heart
and
a
hundred
glances
up
the
road
she
waited
upon
the
strangers
and
i
doubt
not
cursed
them
for
the
wants
that
stood
between
her
and
her
need
for
tears
it
was
a
genuine
little
tragedy
the
mother
in
a
heavy
passionless
voice
rebuked
her
impatience
yet
sat
up
far
into
the
night
bowed
over
a
heap
of
sewing
for
the
daughter
benefit
these
things
i
beheld
in
the
long
twilight
and
whispering
night
loafing
round
the
little
house
with
california
who
himself
like
a
lotus
to
the
moon
or
in
the
little
boarded
bunk
that
was
our
bedroom
tales
with
portland
and
the
old
man
most
of
the
yarns
began
in
this
way
red
larry
was
a
back
of
lone
county
montana
or
there
was
a
man
riding
the
trail
met
a
sitting
in
a
cactus
or
the
time
of
the
san
diego
land
boom
a
woman
from
monterey
etc
you
can
try
to
piece
out
for
yourselves
what
sort
of
stories
they
were
iv
the
yellowstone
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
carter
who
brought
his
team
and
a
friend
into
the
yellowstone
park
without
due
thought
presently
they
came
upon
a
few
of
the
natural
beauties
of
the
place
and
that
carter
turned
his
team
into
his
friend
team
howling
get
out
o
this
jim
all
alight
under
our
noses
and
they
called
the
place
hell
to
this
day
to
witness
if
the
carter
lied
we
too
the
old
lady
from
chicago
her
husband
tom
and
the
good
little
mares
came
to
hell
which
is
about
sixty
acres
in
extent
and
when
tom
said
would
you
like
to
drive
over
it
we
said
certainly
not
and
if
you
do
we
shall
report
you
to
the
park
there
was
a
plain
blistered
peeled
and
abominable
and
it
was
given
over
to
the
sportings
and
spoutings
of
devils
who
threw
mud
and
steam
and
dirt
at
each
other
with
whoops
and
halloos
and
bellowing
curses
the
places
smelled
of
the
refuse
of
the
pit
and
that
odor
mixed
with
the
clean
wholesome
aroma
of
the
pines
in
our
nostrils
throughout
the
day
this
yellowstone
park
is
laid
out
like
ollendorf
in
exercises
of
progressive
difficulty
hell
was
a
prelude
to
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
geyser
formation
we
passed
hot
streams
boiling
in
the
forest
saw
whiffs
of
steam
beyond
these
and
yet
other
whiffs
breaking
through
the
misty
green
hills
in
the
far
distance
we
trampled
on
sulphur
in
crystals
and
sniffed
things
much
worse
than
any
sulphur
which
is
known
to
the
upper
world
and
so
journeying
bewildered
with
the
novelty
came
upon
a
really
place
where
tom
suggested
we
should
get
out
and
play
with
the
geysers
on
foot
imagine
mighty
green
fields
splattered
with
all
the
flowers
of
the
summer
growing
up
to
the
very
edge
of
the
lime
that
was
our
first
glimpse
of
the
geyser
basins
the
buggy
had
pulled
up
close
to
a
rough
broken
blistered
cone
of
spelter
stuff
between
ten
and
twenty
feet
high
there
was
trouble
in
that
place
moaning
splashing
gurgling
and
the
clank
of
machinery
a
spurt
of
boiling
water
jumped
into
the
air
and
a
wash
of
water
followed
i
removed
swiftly
the
old
lady
from
chicago
shrieked
what
a
wicked
waste
said
her
husband
i
think
they
call
it
the
riverside
geyser
its
spout
was
torn
and
ragged
like
the
mouth
of
a
gun
when
a
shell
has
burst
there
it
grumbled
madly
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
was
still
i
crept
over
the
steaming
lime
it
was
the
burning
marl
on
which
satan
lay
and
looked
fearfully
down
its
mouth
you
should
never
look
a
gift
geyser
in
the
mouth
i
beheld
a
horrible
slippery
slimy
funnel
with
water
rising
and
falling
ten
feet
at
a
time
then
the
water
rose
to
lip
level
with
a
rush
and
an
infernal
bubbling
troubled
this
devil
bethesda
before
the
sullen
heave
of
the
crest
of
a
wave
lapped
over
the
edge
and
made
me
run
mark
the
nature
of
the
human
soul
i
had
begun
with
awe
not
to
say
terror
for
this
was
my
first
experience
of
such
things
i
stepped
back
from
the
banks
of
the
riverside
geyser
saying
pooh
is
that
all
it
can
do
yet
for
aught
i
knew
the
whole
thing
might
have
blown
up
at
a
notice
she
he
or
it
being
an
arrangement
of
uncertain
temper
we
drifted
on
up
that
miraculous
valley
on
either
side
of
us
were
hills
from
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
feet
high
wooded
from
crest
to
heel
as
far
as
the
eye
could
range
forward
were
columns
of
steam
in
the
air
misshapen
lumps
of
lime
preadamite
monsters
still
pools
of
stretches
of
blue
a
river
that
coiled
on
itself
twenty
times
pointed
bowlders
of
strange
colors
and
ridges
of
glaring
staring
white
a
trooper
of
german
extraction
never
was
park
so
carefully
patrolled
came
up
to
inform
us
that
as
yet
we
had
not
seen
any
of
the
real
geysers
that
they
were
all
a
mile
or
so
up
the
valley
and
tastefully
scattered
round
the
hotel
in
which
we
would
rest
for
the
night
america
is
a
free
country
but
the
citizens
look
down
on
the
soldier
i
had
to
entertain
that
trooper
the
old
lady
from
chicago
would
have
none
of
him
so
we
loafed
alone
together
now
across
pine
logs
sunk
in
swampy
ground
anon
over
the
ringing
geyser
formation
then
pounding
through
or
brushing
through
long
grass
and
why
did
you
enlist
said
i
the
one
face
began
to
work
i
thought
he
would
have
a
fit
but
he
told
me
a
story
instead
such
a
nice
tale
of
a
naughty
little
girl
who
wrote
pretty
love
letters
to
two
men
at
once
she
was
a
simple
village
wife
but
a
wicked
family
novelette
countess
could
have
accomplished
her
ends
better
she
drove
one
man
nearly
wild
with
the
pretty
little
treachery
and
the
other
man
abandoned
her
and
came
west
to
forget
the
trickery
was
that
man
we
rounded
and
limped
over
a
low
spur
of
hill
and
came
out
upon
a
field
of
aching
snowy
lime
rolled
in
sheets
twisted
into
knots
riven
with
rents
and
diamonds
and
stars
stretching
for
more
than
half
a
mile
in
every
direction
on
this
place
of
despair
lay
most
of
the
big
bad
geysers
who
know
when
there
is
trouble
in
krakatoa
who
tell
the
pines
when
there
is
a
cyclone
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
who
are
exhibited
to
visitors
under
pretty
and
fanciful
names
the
first
mound
that
i
encountered
belonged
to
a
goblin
who
was
splashing
in
his
tub
i
heard
him
kick
pull
a
on
his
shoulders
gasp
crack
his
joints
and
rub
himself
down
with
a
towel
then
he
let
the
water
out
of
the
bath
as
a
thoughtful
man
should
and
it
all
sunk
down
out
of
sight
till
another
goblin
arrived
so
we
looked
and
we
wondered
at
the
beehive
whose
mouth
is
built
up
exactly
like
a
hive
at
the
turban
which
is
not
in
the
least
like
a
turban
and
at
many
many
other
geysers
hot
holes
and
springs
some
of
them
rumbled
some
hissed
some
went
off
spasmodically
and
others
lay
dead
still
in
sheets
of
sapphire
and
beryl
would
you
believe
that
even
these
terrible
creatures
have
to
be
guarded
by
the
troopers
to
prevent
the
irreverent
americans
from
chipping
the
cones
to
pieces
or
worse
still
making
the
geyser
sick
if
you
take
a
small
barrel
full
of
and
drop
it
down
a
geyser
mouth
that
geyser
will
presently
be
forced
to
lay
all
before
you
and
for
days
afterward
will
be
of
an
irritated
and
inconstant
stomach
when
they
told
me
the
tale
i
was
filled
with
sympathy
now
i
wish
that
i
had
and
tried
the
experiment
on
some
lonely
little
beast
far
away
in
the
woods
it
sounds
so
probable
and
so
human
yet
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
would
administer
emetics
to
the
giantess
she
is
having
no
mouth
she
looks
like
a
pool
fifty
feet
long
and
thirty
wide
and
there
is
no
ornamentation
about
her
at
irregular
intervals
she
speaks
and
sends
up
a
volume
of
water
over
two
hundred
feet
high
to
begin
with
then
she
is
angry
for
a
day
and
a
half
sometimes
for
two
days
owing
to
her
peculiarity
of
going
mad
in
the
night
not
many
people
have
seen
the
giantess
at
her
finest
but
the
clamor
of
her
unrest
men
say
shakes
the
wooden
hotel
and
echoes
like
thunder
among
the
hills
the
congregation
returned
to
the
hotel
to
put
down
their
impressions
in
diaries
and
which
they
wrote
up
ostentatiously
in
the
verandas
it
was
a
sweltering
hot
day
albeit
we
stood
higher
than
the
level
of
simla
and
i
left
that
raw
pine
creaking
caravansary
for
the
cool
shade
of
a
clump
of
pines
between
whose
trunks
glimmered
tents
a
batch
of
united
states
troopers
came
down
the
road
and
flung
themselves
across
the
country
into
their
rough
lines
the
mexican
cavalryman
can
ride
though
he
keeps
his
accoutrements
and
his
horse
i
was
free
of
that
camp
in
five
minutes
free
to
play
with
the
heavy
lumpy
carbines
have
the
saddles
stripped
and
punch
the
horses
knowingly
in
the
ribs
one
of
the
men
had
been
in
the
fight
with
and
he
told
me
how
that
great
chief
his
tail
tied
up
in
red
calico
swaggered
in
front
of
the
united
states
cavalry
challenging
all
to
single
combat
but
he
was
slain
and
a
few
of
his
tribe
with
him
there
no
use
in
an
indian
anyway
concluded
my
friend
a
couple
of
real
jingled
through
the
camp
amid
a
shower
of
mild
chaff
they
were
on
their
way
to
cook
city
i
fancy
and
i
know
that
they
never
washed
but
they
were
picturesque
ruffians
exceedingly
with
long
spurs
hooded
stirrups
slouch
hats
fur
over
their
knees
and
just
easy
to
hand
the
goin
under
before
long
said
my
friend
soon
as
the
country
settled
up
he
have
to
go
but
he
mighty
useful
now
what
would
we
do
without
the
as
how
said
i
and
the
camp
laughed
he
has
the
money
we
have
the
skill
he
comes
in
winter
to
play
poker
at
the
military
posts
we
play
poker
a
few
when
he
lost
his
money
we
make
him
drunk
and
let
him
go
sometimes
we
get
the
wrong
and
he
told
me
a
tale
of
an
innocent
who
turned
up
cleaned
out
at
an
army
post
and
played
poker
for
hours
but
it
was
the
post
that
was
cleaned
out
when
that
caucasian
removed
himself
heavy
with
everybody
pay
and
declining
the
proffered
liquor
noaw
said
the
historian
i
do
play
with
no
unless
he
a
little
bit
drunk
ere
i
departed
i
gathered
from
more
than
one
man
the
significant
fact
that
up
to
one
hundred
yards
he
felt
absolutely
secure
behind
his
revolver
in
england
i
understand
quoth
the
limber
youth
from
the
south
in
england
a
man
is
allowed
to
play
with
no
he
got
to
be
taught
all
that
when
he
enlists
i
did
want
much
teaching
how
to
shoot
straight
i
served
uncle
sam
and
that
just
where
it
is
but
you
was
talking
about
your
horse
guards
now
i
explained
briefly
some
peculiarities
of
equipment
connected
with
our
crackest
crack
cavalry
i
grieve
to
say
the
camp
roared
take
over
swampy
ground
let
run
around
a
bit
an
work
the
starch
out
of
an
then
almighty
if
we
would
plug
at
ease
i
eat
their
there
was
a
maiden
a
very
little
maiden
who
had
just
stepped
out
of
one
of
james
novels
she
owned
a
delightful
mother
and
an
equally
delightful
father
a
man
of
finance
the
parents
thought
that
their
daughter
wanted
change
she
lived
in
new
hampshire
accordingly
she
had
dragged
them
up
to
alaska
and
to
the
yosemite
valley
and
was
now
returning
leisurely
via
the
yellowstone
just
in
time
for
the
of
the
summer
season
at
saratoga
we
had
met
once
or
twice
before
in
the
park
and
i
had
been
amazed
and
amused
at
her
critical
commendation
of
the
wonders
that
she
saw
from
that
very
resolute
little
mouth
i
received
a
lecture
on
american
literature
the
nature
and
inwardness
of
washington
society
the
precise
value
of
cable
works
as
compared
with
uncle
remus
harris
and
a
few
other
things
that
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
geysers
but
were
altogether
pleasant
now
an
english
maiden
who
had
stumbled
on
a
collarless
wanderer
come
from
and
going
to
goodness
knows
where
would
her
mother
inciting
her
and
her
father
brandishing
an
umbrella
have
regarded
him
as
a
dissolute
adventurer
a
person
to
be
disregarded
not
so
those
delightful
people
from
new
hampshire
they
were
good
enough
to
treat
him
it
sounds
almost
incredible
as
a
human
being
possibly
respectable
probably
not
in
immediate
need
of
financial
assistance
papa
talked
pleasantly
and
to
the
point
the
little
maiden
strove
valiantly
with
the
accent
of
her
birth
and
that
of
her
rearing
and
mamma
smiled
benignly
in
the
background
balance
this
with
a
story
of
a
young
english
idiot
i
met
mooning
about
inside
his
high
collar
attended
by
a
valet
he
condescended
to
tell
me
that
you
ca
be
too
careful
who
you
talk
to
in
these
and
stalked
on
fearing
i
suppose
every
minute
for
his
social
chastity
that
man
was
a
barbarian
i
took
occasion
to
tell
him
so
for
he
comported
himself
after
the
manner
of
the
and
hunted
of
assam
who
are
at
perpetual
feud
one
with
another
you
will
understand
that
these
foolish
stories
are
introduced
in
order
to
cover
the
fact
that
this
pen
can
not
describe
the
glories
of
the
upper
geyser
basin
the
evening
i
spent
under
the
lee
of
the
castle
geyser
sitting
on
a
log
with
some
troopers
and
watching
a
baronial
keep
forty
feet
high
spouting
hot
water
if
the
castle
went
off
first
they
said
the
giantess
would
be
quiet
and
vice
versa
and
then
they
told
tales
till
the
moon
got
up
and
a
party
of
campers
in
the
woods
gave
us
all
something
to
eat
then
came
soft
turfy
forest
that
deadened
the
wheels
and
two
troopers
on
detachment
duty
stole
noiselessly
behind
us
one
was
the
man
and
they
talked
merrily
while
the
horses
bucked
about
among
the
trees
and
so
a
cavalry
escort
was
with
us
for
a
mile
till
we
got
to
a
mighty
hill
strewn
with
moss
agates
and
everybody
had
to
jump
out
and
pant
in
that
thin
air
but
how
intoxicating
it
was
the
old
lady
from
chicago
ducked
like
an
emancipated
hen
as
she
scuttled
about
the
road
cramming
pieces
of
rock
into
her
reticule
she
sent
me
fifty
yards
down
to
the
to
pick
up
a
piece
of
broken
bottle
which
she
insisted
was
moss
agate
i
some
o
that
at
home
an
they
shine
yes
you
go
get
it
young
as
we
climbed
the
long
path
the
road
grew
viler
and
viler
till
it
became
without
disguise
the
bed
of
a
torrent
and
just
when
things
were
at
their
rockiest
we
nearly
fell
into
a
little
sapphire
lake
but
never
sapphire
was
so
blue
called
mary
lake
and
that
between
eight
and
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
afterward
grass
downs
all
on
a
vehement
slope
so
that
the
buggy
following
the
road
ran
on
the
two
mostly
till
we
dipped
into
a
ford
climbed
up
a
cliff
raced
along
down
dipped
again
and
pulled
up
dishevelled
at
larry
for
lunch
and
an
hour
rest
then
we
lay
on
the
grass
and
laughed
with
sheer
bliss
of
being
alive
this
have
i
known
once
in
japan
once
on
the
banks
of
the
columbia
what
time
the
salmon
came
in
and
california
howled
and
once
again
in
the
yellowstone
by
the
light
of
the
eyes
of
the
maiden
from
new
hampshire
four
little
pools
lay
at
my
elbow
one
was
of
black
water
tepid
one
clear
water
cold
one
clear
water
hot
one
red
water
boiling
my
newly
washed
handkerchief
covered
them
all
and
we
two
marvelled
as
children
marvel
this
evening
we
shall
do
the
grand
canyon
of
the
yellowstone
said
the
maiden
together
said
i
and
she
said
the
sun
was
beginning
to
sink
when
we
heard
the
roar
of
falling
waters
and
came
to
a
broad
river
along
whose
banks
we
ran
and
then
i
might
at
a
pinch
describe
the
infernal
regions
but
not
the
other
place
the
yellowstone
river
has
occasion
to
run
through
a
gorge
about
eight
miles
long
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
it
makes
two
leaps
one
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
the
other
of
three
hundred
feet
i
investigated
the
upper
or
lesser
fall
which
is
close
to
the
hotel
up
to
that
time
nothing
particular
happens
to
the
yellowstone
its
banks
being
only
rocky
rather
steep
and
plentifully
adorned
with
pines
at
the
falls
it
comes
round
a
corner
green
solid
ribbed
with
a
little
foam
and
not
more
than
thirty
yards
wide
then
it
goes
over
still
green
and
rather
more
solid
than
before
after
a
minute
or
two
you
sitting
upon
a
rock
directly
above
the
drop
begin
to
understand
that
something
has
occurred
that
the
river
has
jumped
between
solid
cliff
walls
and
that
the
gentle
froth
of
water
lapping
the
sides
of
the
gorge
below
is
really
the
outcome
of
great
waves
and
the
river
yells
aloud
but
the
cliffs
do
not
allow
the
yells
to
escape
that
inspection
began
with
curiosity
and
finished
in
terror
for
it
seemed
that
the
whole
world
was
sliding
in
chrysolite
from
under
my
feet
i
followed
with
the
others
round
the
corner
to
arrive
at
the
brink
of
the
canyon
we
had
to
climb
up
a
nearly
perpendicular
ascent
to
begin
with
for
the
ground
rises
more
than
the
river
drops
stately
pine
woods
fringe
either
lip
of
the
gorge
which
is
the
gorge
of
the
yellowstone
you
find
all
about
it
in
the
guide
books
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
without
warning
or
preparation
i
looked
into
a
gulf
seventeen
hundred
feet
deep
with
eagles
and
circling
far
below
and
the
sides
of
that
gulf
were
one
wild
welter
of
color
crimson
emerald
cobalt
ochre
amber
honey
splashed
with
port
wine
snow
white
vermilion
lemon
and
silver
gray
in
wide
washes
the
sides
did
not
fall
sheer
but
were
graven
by
time
and
water
and
air
into
monstrous
heads
of
kings
dead
chiefs
men
and
women
of
the
old
time
so
far
below
that
no
sound
of
its
strife
could
reach
us
the
yellowstone
river
ran
a
strip
of
jade
green
the
sunlight
took
those
wondrous
walls
and
gave
fresh
hues
to
those
that
nature
had
already
laid
there
evening
crept
through
the
pines
that
shadowed
us
but
the
full
glory
of
the
day
flamed
in
that
canyon
as
we
went
out
very
cautiously
to
a
jutting
piece
of
rock
or
pink
it
was
that
overhung
the
deepest
deeps
of
all
now
i
know
what
it
is
to
sit
enthroned
amid
the
clouds
of
sunset
as
the
spirits
sit
in
blake
pictures
giddiness
took
away
all
sensation
of
touch
or
form
but
the
sense
of
blinding
color
remained
when
i
reached
the
mainland
again
i
had
sworn
that
i
had
been
floating
the
maid
from
new
hampshire
said
no
word
for
a
very
long
time
then
she
quoted
poetry
which
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
she
could
have
done
and
to
think
that
this
has
been
going
on
all
these
days
none
of
we
ever
saw
it
said
the
old
lady
from
chicago
with
an
acid
glance
at
her
husband
no
only
the
injians
said
he
unmoved
and
the
maiden
and
i
laughed
inspiration
is
fleeting
beauty
is
vain
and
the
power
of
the
mind
for
wonder
limited
though
the
shining
hosts
themselves
had
risen
choiring
from
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
they
would
not
have
prevented
her
papa
and
one
baser
than
he
from
rolling
stones
down
those
stupendous
slides
seventeen
hundred
feet
of
pitch
and
rather
more
than
seventeen
hundred
colors
for
log
or
bowlder
to
whirl
through
so
we
heaved
things
and
saw
them
gather
way
and
bound
from
white
rock
to
red
or
yellow
dragging
behind
them
torrents
of
color
till
the
noise
of
their
descent
ceased
and
they
bounded
a
hundred
yards
clear
at
the
last
into
the
yellowstone
i
been
down
there
said
tom
that
evening
it
easy
to
get
down
if
you
careful
just
sit
an
slide
but
getting
up
is
worse
i
found
down
below
there
two
stones
just
marked
with
a
picture
of
the
canyon
i
would
sell
these
rocks
not
for
fifteen
and
papa
and
i
crawled
down
to
the
yellowstone
just
above
the
first
little
fall
to
wet
a
line
for
good
luck
the
round
moon
came
up
and
turned
the
cliffs
and
pines
into
silver
and
a
trout
came
up
also
and
we
slew
him
among
the
rocks
nearly
tumbling
into
that
wild
river
then
out
and
away
to
livingstone
once
more
the
maiden
from
new
hampshire
disappeared
papa
and
mamma
with
her
disappeared
too
the
old
lady
from
chicago
and
the
others
chicago
i
know
thy
cunning
and
thy
greed
thy
hard
high
lust
and
wilful
deed
and
all
thy
glory
loves
to
tell
of
specious
gifts
i
have
struck
a
city
a
real
city
and
they
call
it
chicago
the
other
places
do
not
count
san
francisco
was
a
as
well
as
a
city
and
salt
lake
was
a
phenomenon
this
place
is
the
first
american
city
i
have
encountered
it
holds
rather
more
than
a
million
of
people
with
bodies
and
stands
on
the
same
sort
of
soil
as
calcutta
having
seen
it
i
urgently
desire
never
to
see
it
again
it
is
inhabited
by
savages
its
water
is
the
water
of
the
hooghly
and
its
air
is
dirt
also
it
says
that
it
is
the
boss
town
of
america
i
do
not
believe
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
country
they
told
me
to
go
to
the
palmer
house
which
is
overmuch
gilded
and
mirrored
and
there
i
found
a
huge
hall
of
tessellated
marble
crammed
with
people
talking
about
money
and
spitting
about
everywhere
other
barbarians
charged
in
and
out
of
this
inferno
with
letters
and
telegrams
in
their
hands
and
yet
others
shouted
at
each
other
a
man
who
had
drunk
quite
as
much
as
was
good
for
him
told
me
that
this
was
the
finest
hotel
in
the
finest
city
on
god
almighty
by
the
way
when
an
american
wishes
to
indicate
the
next
country
or
state
he
says
god
this
prevents
discussion
and
flatters
his
vanity
then
i
went
out
into
the
streets
which
are
long
and
flat
and
without
end
and
verily
it
is
not
a
good
thing
to
live
in
the
east
for
any
length
of
time
your
ideas
grow
to
clash
with
those
held
by
every
man
i
looked
down
interminable
vistas
flanked
with
nine
ten
and
houses
and
crowded
with
men
and
women
and
the
show
impressed
me
with
a
great
horror
except
in
london
and
i
have
forgotten
what
london
was
like
i
had
never
seen
so
many
white
people
together
and
never
such
a
collection
of
miserables
there
was
no
color
in
the
street
and
no
beauty
only
a
maze
of
wire
ropes
overhead
and
dirty
stone
flagging
under
foot
a
volunteered
to
show
me
the
glory
of
the
town
for
so
much
an
hour
and
with
him
i
wandered
far
he
conceived
that
all
this
turmoil
and
squash
was
a
thing
to
be
reverently
admired
that
it
was
good
to
huddle
men
together
in
fifteen
layers
one
atop
of
the
other
and
to
dig
holes
in
the
ground
for
offices
he
said
that
chicago
was
a
live
town
and
that
all
the
creatures
hurrying
by
me
were
engaged
in
business
that
is
to
say
they
were
trying
to
make
some
money
that
they
might
not
die
through
lack
of
food
to
put
into
their
bellies
he
took
me
to
canals
as
black
as
ink
and
filled
with
abominations
and
bid
me
watch
the
stream
of
traffic
across
the
bridges
he
then
took
me
into
a
saloon
and
while
i
drank
made
me
note
that
the
floor
was
covered
with
coins
sunk
in
cement
a
hottentot
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
this
sort
of
barbarism
the
coins
made
an
effect
pretty
enough
but
the
man
who
put
them
there
had
no
thought
of
beauty
and
therefore
he
was
a
savage
then
my
showed
me
business
blocks
gay
with
signs
and
studded
with
fantastic
and
absurd
advertisements
of
goods
and
looking
down
the
long
street
so
adorned
it
was
as
though
each
vender
stood
at
his
door
howling
for
the
sake
of
my
money
employ
or
buy
of
me
and
me
only
have
you
ever
seen
a
crowd
at
a
distribution
you
know
then
how
the
men
leap
into
the
air
stretching
out
their
arms
above
the
crowd
in
the
hope
of
being
seen
while
the
women
dolorously
slap
the
stomachs
of
their
children
and
whimper
i
had
sooner
watch
famine
relief
than
the
white
man
engaged
in
what
he
calls
legitimate
competition
the
one
i
understand
the
other
makes
me
and
the
cabman
said
that
these
things
were
the
proof
of
progress
and
by
that
i
knew
he
had
been
reading
his
newspaper
as
every
intelligent
american
should
the
papers
tell
their
clientele
in
language
fitted
to
their
comprehension
that
the
snarling
together
of
the
heaving
up
of
houses
and
the
making
of
money
is
progress
i
spent
ten
hours
in
that
huge
wilderness
wandering
through
scores
of
miles
of
these
terrible
streets
and
jostling
some
few
hundred
thousand
of
these
terrible
people
who
talked
paisa
bat
through
their
noses
the
cabman
left
me
but
after
awhile
i
picked
up
another
man
who
was
full
of
figures
and
into
my
ears
he
poured
them
as
occasion
required
or
the
big
blank
factories
suggested
here
they
turned
out
so
many
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
such
and
such
an
article
there
so
many
million
other
things
this
house
was
worth
so
many
million
dollars
that
one
so
many
million
more
or
less
it
was
like
listening
to
a
child
babbling
of
its
hoard
of
shells
it
was
like
watching
a
fool
playing
with
buttons
but
i
was
expected
to
do
more
than
listen
or
watch
he
demanded
that
i
should
admire
and
the
utmost
that
i
could
say
was
are
these
things
so
then
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
made
him
angry
and
he
said
that
insular
envy
made
me
unresponsive
so
you
see
i
could
not
make
him
understand
about
four
and
a
half
hours
after
adam
was
turned
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
he
felt
hungry
and
so
bidding
eve
take
care
that
her
head
was
not
broken
by
the
descending
fruit
shinned
up
a
that
hurt
his
legs
cut
his
breast
and
made
him
breathe
heavily
and
eve
was
tormented
with
fear
lest
her
lord
should
miss
his
footing
and
so
bring
the
tragedy
of
this
world
to
an
end
ere
the
curtain
had
fairly
risen
had
i
met
adam
then
i
should
have
been
sorry
for
him
i
find
eleven
hundred
thousand
of
his
sons
just
as
far
advanced
as
their
father
in
the
art
of
getting
food
and
immeasurably
inferior
to
him
in
that
they
think
that
their
lead
straight
to
the
skies
consequently
i
am
sorry
in
rather
more
than
a
million
different
ways
in
the
east
bread
comes
naturally
even
to
the
poorest
by
a
little
scratching
or
the
gift
of
a
friend
not
quite
so
poor
in
less
favored
countries
one
is
apt
to
forget
then
i
went
to
bed
and
that
was
on
a
saturday
night
sunday
brought
me
the
queerest
experiences
of
all
a
revelation
of
barbarism
complete
i
found
a
place
that
was
officially
described
as
a
church
it
was
a
circus
really
but
that
the
worshippers
did
not
know
there
were
flowers
all
about
the
building
which
was
fitted
up
with
plush
and
stained
oak
and
much
luxury
including
twisted
brass
candlesticks
of
severest
gothic
design
to
these
things
and
a
congregation
of
savages
entered
suddenly
a
wonderful
man
completely
in
the
confidence
of
their
god
whom
he
treated
colloquially
and
exploited
very
much
as
a
newspaper
reporter
would
exploit
a
foreign
potentate
but
unlike
the
newspaper
reporter
he
never
allowed
his
listeners
to
forget
that
he
and
not
he
was
the
centre
of
attraction
with
a
voice
of
silver
and
with
imagery
borrowed
from
the
he
built
up
for
his
hearers
a
heaven
on
the
lines
of
the
palmer
house
but
with
all
the
gilding
real
gold
and
all
the
diamond
and
set
in
the
centre
of
it
a
argumentative
very
shrewd
creation
that
he
called
god
one
sentence
at
this
point
caught
my
delighted
ear
it
was
apropos
of
some
question
of
the
judgment
and
ran
no
i
tell
you
god
does
do
business
that
he
was
giving
them
a
deity
whom
they
could
comprehend
and
a
gold
and
jewelled
heaven
in
which
they
could
take
a
natural
interest
he
interlarded
his
performance
with
the
slang
of
the
streets
the
counter
and
the
exchange
and
he
said
that
religion
ought
to
enter
into
daily
life
consequently
i
presume
he
introduced
it
as
daily
life
his
own
and
the
life
of
his
friends
then
i
escaped
before
the
blessing
desiring
no
benediction
at
such
hands
but
the
persons
who
listened
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
and
i
understood
that
i
had
met
with
a
popular
preacher
later
on
when
i
had
perused
the
sermons
of
a
gentleman
called
talmage
and
some
others
i
perceived
that
i
had
been
listening
to
a
very
mild
specimen
yet
that
man
with
his
brutal
gold
and
silver
idols
his
and
style
of
dealing
with
the
sacred
vessels
would
count
himself
spiritually
quite
competent
to
send
a
mission
to
convert
the
indians
all
that
sunday
i
listened
to
people
who
said
that
the
mere
fact
of
spiking
down
strips
of
iron
to
wood
and
getting
a
steam
and
iron
thing
to
run
along
them
was
progress
that
the
telephone
was
progress
and
the
of
wires
overhead
was
progress
they
repeated
their
statements
again
and
again
one
of
them
took
me
to
their
city
hall
and
board
of
trade
works
and
pointed
it
out
with
pride
it
was
very
ugly
but
very
big
and
the
streets
in
front
of
it
were
narrow
and
unclean
when
i
saw
the
faces
of
the
men
who
did
business
in
that
building
i
felt
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
in
their
billeting
by
the
way
is
a
consolation
to
feel
that
i
am
not
writing
to
an
english
audience
then
i
should
have
to
fall
into
feigned
ecstasies
over
the
marvellous
progress
of
chicago
since
the
days
of
the
great
fire
to
allude
casually
to
the
raising
of
the
entire
city
so
many
feet
above
the
level
of
the
lake
which
it
faces
and
generally
to
grovel
before
the
golden
calf
but
you
who
are
desperately
poor
and
therefore
by
these
standards
of
no
know
things
will
understand
when
i
write
that
they
have
managed
to
get
a
million
of
men
together
on
flat
land
and
that
the
bulk
of
these
men
together
appear
to
be
lower
than
mahajans
and
not
so
companionable
as
a
punjabi
jat
after
harvest
but
i
do
think
it
was
the
blind
hurry
of
the
people
their
argot
and
their
grand
ignorance
of
things
beyond
their
immediate
interests
that
displeased
me
so
much
as
a
study
of
the
daily
papers
of
chicago
imprimis
there
was
some
sort
of
a
dispute
between
new
york
and
chicago
as
to
which
town
should
give
an
exhibition
of
products
to
be
hereafter
holden
and
through
the
medium
of
their
more
dignified
journals
the
two
cities
were
yahooing
and
at
each
other
like
opposition
newsboys
they
called
it
humor
but
it
sounded
like
something
quite
different
that
was
only
the
first
trouble
the
second
lay
in
the
tone
of
the
productions
leading
articles
which
include
gems
such
as
back
of
such
and
such
a
place
or
we
noticed
tuesday
such
an
event
or
do
for
does
not
are
things
to
be
accepted
with
thankfulness
all
that
made
me
want
to
cry
was
that
in
these
papers
were
faithfully
reproduced
all
the
and
of
the
palmer
house
bar
the
slang
of
the
the
mental
elevation
and
integrity
of
the
pullman
car
porter
the
dignity
of
the
dime
museum
and
the
accuracy
of
the
excited
i
am
sternly
forbidden
to
believe
that
the
paper
educates
the
public
then
i
am
compelled
to
believe
that
the
public
educate
the
paper
yet
suicides
on
the
press
are
rare
just
when
the
sense
of
unreality
and
oppression
was
strongest
upon
me
and
when
i
most
wanted
help
a
man
sat
at
my
side
and
began
to
talk
what
he
called
politics
i
had
chanced
to
pay
about
six
shillings
for
a
worth
and
he
made
of
the
fact
a
text
for
a
sermon
he
said
that
this
was
a
rich
country
and
that
the
people
liked
to
pay
two
hundred
per
cent
on
the
value
of
a
thing
they
could
afford
it
he
said
that
the
government
imposed
a
protective
duty
of
from
ten
to
seventy
per
cent
on
articles
and
that
the
american
manufacturer
consequently
could
sell
his
goods
for
a
healthy
sum
thus
an
imported
hat
would
with
duty
cost
two
guineas
the
american
manufacturer
would
make
a
hat
for
seventeen
shillings
and
sell
it
for
one
pound
fifteen
in
these
things
he
said
lay
the
greatness
of
america
and
the
effeteness
of
england
competition
between
factory
and
factory
kept
the
prices
down
to
decent
limits
but
i
was
never
to
forget
that
this
people
were
a
rich
people
not
like
the
pauper
continentals
and
that
they
enjoyed
paying
duties
to
my
weak
intellect
this
seemed
rather
like
juggling
with
counters
everything
that
i
have
yet
purchased
costs
about
twice
as
much
as
it
would
in
england
and
when
native
made
is
of
inferior
quality
moreover
since
these
lines
were
first
thought
of
i
have
visited
a
gentleman
who
owned
a
factory
which
used
to
produce
things
he
owned
the
factory
still
not
a
man
was
in
it
but
he
was
drawing
a
handsome
income
from
a
syndicate
of
firms
for
keeping
it
closed
in
order
that
it
might
not
produce
things
this
man
said
that
if
protection
were
abandoned
a
tide
of
pauper
labor
would
flood
the
country
and
as
i
looked
at
his
factory
i
thought
how
entirely
better
it
was
to
have
no
labor
of
any
kind
whatever
rather
than
face
so
horrible
a
future
meantime
do
you
remember
that
this
peculiar
country
enjoys
paying
money
for
value
not
received
i
am
an
alien
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
why
six
shillings
should
be
paid
for
caps
or
eight
shillings
for
when
the
country
fills
up
to
a
decently
populated
level
a
few
million
people
who
are
not
aliens
will
be
smitten
with
the
same
sort
of
blindness
but
my
friend
assertion
somehow
thoroughly
suited
the
grotesque
ferocity
of
chicago
see
now
and
judge
in
the
village
of
isser
jang
on
the
road
to
montgomery
there
be
four
changar
women
who
winnow
corn
some
seventy
bushels
a
year
beyond
their
hut
lives
purun
dass
the
who
on
good
security
lends
as
much
as
five
thousand
rupees
in
a
year
jowala
singh
the
smith
mends
the
village
plows
some
thirty
broken
at
the
share
in
three
hundred
and
days
and
hukm
chund
who
is
and
head
of
the
little
club
under
the
travellers
tree
generally
keeps
the
village
posted
in
such
gossip
as
the
barber
and
the
have
not
yet
made
public
property
chicago
husks
and
winnows
her
wheat
by
the
million
bushels
a
hundred
banks
lend
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
the
year
and
scores
of
factories
turn
out
and
machinery
by
steam
scores
of
daily
papers
do
work
which
hukm
chund
and
the
barber
and
the
midwife
perform
with
due
regard
for
public
opinion
in
the
village
of
isser
jang
so
far
as
manufactories
go
the
difference
between
chicago
on
the
lake
and
isser
jang
on
the
montgomery
road
is
one
of
degree
only
and
not
of
kind
as
far
as
the
understanding
of
the
uses
of
life
goes
isser
jang
for
all
its
seasonal
cholers
has
the
advantage
over
chicago
jowala
singh
knows
and
takes
care
to
avoid
the
three
or
four
fields
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
but
he
is
not
urged
by
millions
of
devils
to
run
about
all
day
in
the
sun
and
swear
that
his
plowshares
are
the
best
in
the
punjab
nor
does
purun
dass
fly
forth
in
an
ekka
more
than
once
or
twice
a
year
and
he
knows
on
a
pinch
how
to
use
the
railway
and
the
telegraph
as
well
as
any
son
of
israel
in
chicago
but
this
is
absurd
the
east
is
not
the
west
and
these
men
must
continue
to
deal
with
the
machinery
of
life
and
to
call
it
progress
their
very
preachers
dare
not
rebuke
them
they
gloss
over
the
hunting
for
money
and
the
bitterness
of
adam
curse
by
saying
that
such
things
dower
a
man
with
a
larger
range
of
thoughts
and
higher
aspirations
they
do
not
say
free
yourselves
from
your
own
slavery
but
rather
if
you
can
possibly
manage
it
do
not
set
quite
so
much
store
on
the
things
of
this
and
they
do
not
know
what
the
things
of
this
world
are
i
went
off
to
see
cattle
killed
by
way
of
clearing
my
head
which
as
you
will
perceive
was
getting
muddled
they
say
every
englishman
goes
to
the
chicago
you
shall
find
them
about
six
miles
from
the
city
and
once
having
seen
them
you
will
never
forget
the
sight
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
stretches
a
of
cunningly
divided
into
blocks
so
that
the
animals
of
any
pen
can
be
speedily
driven
out
close
to
an
inclined
timber
path
which
leads
to
an
elevated
covered
way
straddling
high
above
the
pens
these
viaducts
are
on
the
upper
story
tramp
the
doomed
cattle
stolidly
for
the
most
part
on
the
lower
with
a
scuffling
of
sharp
hoofs
and
multitudinous
yells
run
the
pigs
the
same
end
being
appointed
for
each
thus
you
will
see
the
gangs
of
cattle
waiting
their
turn
as
they
wait
sometimes
for
days
and
they
need
not
be
distressed
by
the
sight
of
their
fellows
running
about
in
the
fear
of
death
all
they
know
is
that
a
man
on
horseback
causes
their
neighbors
to
move
by
means
of
a
whip
certain
bars
and
fences
are
unshipped
and
behold
that
crowd
have
gone
up
the
mouth
of
a
sloping
tunnel
and
return
no
more
it
is
different
with
the
pigs
they
shriek
back
the
news
of
the
exodus
to
their
friends
and
a
hundred
pens
skirl
responsive
it
was
to
the
pigs
i
first
addressed
myself
selecting
a
viaduct
which
was
full
of
them
as
i
could
hear
though
i
could
not
see
i
marked
a
sombre
building
whereto
it
ran
and
went
there
not
unalarmed
by
stray
cattle
who
had
managed
to
escape
from
their
proper
quarters
a
pleasant
smell
of
brine
warned
me
of
what
was
coming
i
entered
the
factory
and
found
it
full
of
pork
in
barrels
and
on
another
story
more
pork
and
in
a
huge
room
the
halves
of
swine
for
whose
behoof
great
lumps
of
ice
were
being
pitched
in
at
the
window
that
room
was
the
mortuary
chamber
where
the
pigs
lay
for
a
little
while
in
state
ere
they
began
their
progress
through
such
passages
as
kings
may
sometimes
travel
turning
a
corner
and
not
noting
an
overhead
arrangement
of
greased
rail
wheel
and
pulley
i
ran
into
the
arms
of
four
eviscerated
carcasses
all
pure
white
and
of
a
human
aspect
pushed
by
a
man
clad
in
vehement
red
when
i
leaped
aside
the
floor
was
slippery
under
me
also
there
was
a
flavor
of
in
my
nostrils
and
the
shouting
of
a
multitude
in
my
ears
but
there
was
no
joy
in
that
shouting
twelve
men
stood
in
two
lines
six
a
side
between
them
and
overhead
ran
the
railway
of
death
that
had
nearly
shunted
me
through
the
window
each
man
carried
a
knife
the
sleeves
of
his
shirt
were
cut
off
at
the
elbows
and
from
bosom
to
heel
he
was
beyond
this
perspective
was
a
column
of
steam
and
beyond
that
was
where
i
worked
my
way
unwilling
to
touch
beam
or
wall
the
atmosphere
was
stifling
as
a
night
in
the
rains
by
reason
of
the
steam
and
the
crowd
i
climbed
to
the
beginning
of
things
and
perched
upon
a
narrow
beam
overlooked
very
nearly
all
the
pigs
ever
bred
in
wisconsin
they
had
just
been
shot
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
viaduct
and
huddled
together
in
a
large
pen
thence
they
were
flicked
persuasively
a
few
at
a
time
into
a
smaller
chamber
and
there
a
man
fixed
tackle
on
their
hinder
legs
so
that
they
rose
in
the
air
suspended
from
the
railway
of
death
oh
it
was
then
they
shrieked
and
called
on
their
mothers
and
made
promises
of
amendment
till
the
punted
them
in
their
backs
and
they
slid
head
down
into
a
passage
very
like
a
big
kitchen
sink
that
was
there
awaited
them
a
red
man
with
a
knife
which
he
passed
jauntily
through
their
throats
and
the
shriek
became
a
splutter
and
then
a
fall
as
of
heavy
tropical
rain
and
the
red
man
who
was
backed
against
the
you
will
understand
stood
clear
of
the
wildly
kicking
hoofs
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
not
from
any
feeling
of
compassion
but
because
the
spurted
blood
was
in
his
eyes
and
he
had
barely
time
to
stick
the
next
arrival
then
that
first
stuck
swine
dropped
still
kicking
into
a
great
vat
of
boiling
water
and
spoke
no
more
words
but
wallowed
in
obedience
to
some
unseen
machinery
and
presently
came
forth
at
the
lower
end
of
the
vat
and
was
heaved
on
the
blades
of
a
blunt
things
which
said
hough
hough
hough
and
skelped
all
the
hair
off
him
except
what
little
a
couple
of
men
with
knives
could
remove
then
he
was
again
hitched
by
the
heels
to
that
said
railway
and
passed
down
the
line
of
the
twelve
men
each
man
with
a
knife
losing
with
each
man
a
certain
amount
of
his
individuality
which
was
taken
away
in
a
and
when
he
reached
the
last
man
he
was
very
beautiful
to
behold
but
excessively
unstuffed
and
limp
preponderance
of
individuality
was
ever
a
bar
to
foreign
travel
that
pig
could
have
been
in
case
to
visit
you
in
india
had
he
not
parted
with
some
of
his
most
cherished
notions
the
dissecting
part
impressed
me
not
so
much
as
the
slaying
they
were
so
excessively
alive
these
pigs
and
then
they
were
so
excessively
dead
and
the
man
in
the
dripping
clammy
not
passage
did
not
seem
to
care
and
ere
the
blood
of
such
a
one
had
ceased
to
foam
on
the
floor
such
another
and
four
friends
with
him
had
shrieked
and
died
but
a
pig
is
only
the
unclean
animal
the
forbidden
of
the
prophet
vi
the
american
army
i
should
very
much
like
to
deliver
a
dissertation
on
the
american
army
and
the
possibilities
of
its
extension
you
see
it
is
such
a
beautiful
little
army
and
the
dear
people
do
quite
understand
what
to
do
with
it
the
theory
is
that
it
is
an
instructional
nucleus
round
which
the
militia
of
the
country
will
rally
and
from
which
they
will
get
a
stiffening
in
time
of
danger
yet
other
people
consider
that
the
army
should
be
built
like
a
pair
of
lazy
tongs
on
the
principle
of
elasticity
and
extension
so
that
in
time
of
need
it
may
fill
up
its
skeleton
battalions
and
empty
saddle
troops
this
is
real
wisdom
the
american
army
as
at
present
constituted
is
made
up
of
regiments
infantry
ten
companies
each
ten
regiments
cavalry
twelve
companies
each
five
regiments
artillery
twelve
companies
each
now
there
is
a
notion
in
the
air
to
reorganize
the
service
on
these
lines
eighteen
regiments
infantry
at
four
battalions
four
companies
each
third
battalion
skeleton
fourth
on
paper
eight
regiments
cavalry
at
four
battalions
four
troops
each
third
battalion
skeleton
fourth
on
paper
five
regiments
artillery
at
four
battalions
four
companies
each
third
battalion
skeleton
fourth
on
paper
observe
the
beauty
of
this
business
the
third
battalion
will
have
its
officers
but
no
men
the
fourth
will
probably
have
a
rendezvous
and
some
equipment
it
is
not
contemplated
to
give
it
anything
more
definite
at
present
assuming
the
regiments
to
be
made
up
to
full
complement
we
get
an
army
of
fifty
thousand
men
which
after
the
need
passes
away
must
be
cut
down
fifty
per
cent
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
officers
the
military
needs
of
the
states
be
three
a
frontier
warfare
an
employment
well
within
the
grip
of
the
present
army
of
thousand
and
in
the
nature
of
things
growing
less
arduous
year
by
year
b
internal
riots
and
commotions
which
rise
up
like
a
dust
devil
whirl
furiously
and
die
out
long
before
the
authorities
at
washington
could
begin
to
fill
up
even
the
third
skeleton
battalions
much
less
hunt
about
for
material
for
the
fourth
c
civil
war
in
which
as
the
case
in
the
affair
of
the
north
and
south
the
regular
army
would
be
swamped
in
the
mass
of
militia
and
armed
volunteers
would
turn
the
land
into
a
hell
yet
the
authorities
persist
in
regarding
an
external
war
as
a
thing
to
be
seriously
considered
the
power
that
would
disembark
troops
on
american
soil
would
be
capable
of
heaving
a
shovelful
of
mud
into
the
atlantic
in
the
hope
of
filling
it
up
consequently
the
authorities
are
fascinated
with
the
idea
of
the
sliding
scale
or
concertina
army
this
is
an
hereditary
instinct
for
you
know
that
when
we
english
have
got
together
two
companies
one
machine
gun
a
sick
bullock
forty
generals
and
a
mass
of
forms
we
say
we
possess
an
army
corps
capable
of
indefinite
the
american
army
is
a
beautiful
little
army
some
day
when
all
the
indians
are
happily
dead
or
drunk
it
ought
to
make
the
finest
scientific
and
survey
corps
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
does
excellent
work
now
but
there
is
this
defect
in
its
nature
it
is
officered
as
you
know
from
west
point
the
mischief
of
it
is
that
west
point
seems
to
be
created
for
the
purpose
of
spreading
a
general
knowledge
of
military
matters
among
the
people
a
boy
goes
up
to
that
institution
gets
his
pass
and
returns
to
civil
life
so
they
tell
me
with
a
dangerous
knowledge
that
he
is
a
suckling
von
moltke
and
may
apply
his
learning
when
occasion
offers
given
trouble
that
man
will
be
a
nuisance
because
he
is
a
hideously
versatile
american
to
begin
with
as
of
himself
as
a
man
can
be
and
with
all
the
racial
disregard
for
human
life
to
back
him
through
any
generalship
in
a
country
where
as
the
records
of
the
daily
papers
show
men
engaged
in
a
conflict
with
police
or
jails
are
all
too
ready
to
adopt
a
military
formation
and
get
heavily
shot
in
a
sort
of
cheap
warfare
instead
of
being
decently
scared
by
the
appearance
of
the
military
this
sort
of
arrangement
does
not
seem
wise
the
bond
between
the
states
is
of
an
amazing
tenuity
so
long
as
they
do
not
absolutely
march
into
the
district
of
columbia
sit
on
the
washington
statues
and
invent
a
flag
of
their
own
they
can
legislate
lynch
hunt
negroes
through
swamps
divorce
railroad
and
rampage
as
much
as
ever
they
choose
they
do
not
need
knowledge
of
their
own
military
strength
to
back
their
genial
lawlessness
that
regular
army
which
is
a
dear
little
army
should
be
kept
to
itself
blooded
on
detachment
duty
turned
into
the
paths
of
science
and
now
and
again
assembled
at
feasts
of
free
masons
and
so
forth
it
is
too
tiny
to
be
a
political
power
the
immortal
wreck
of
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
is
a
political
power
of
the
largest
and
most
unblushing
description
it
ought
not
to
help
to
lay
the
foundations
of
an
amateur
military
power
that
is
blind
and
irresponsible
by
great
good
luck
the
train
already
delayed
twelve
hours
by
a
burned
bridge
brought
me
to
the
city
on
a
saturday
by
way
of
that
valley
which
the
mormons
over
their
efforts
had
caused
to
blossom
like
the
rose
twelve
hours
previously
i
had
entered
into
a
new
world
where
in
conversation
every
one
was
either
a
mormon
or
a
gentile
it
is
not
seemly
for
a
free
and
independent
citizen
to
dub
himself
a
gentile
but
the
mayor
of
ogden
which
is
the
gentile
city
of
the
valley
told
me
that
there
must
be
some
distinction
between
the
two
flocks
long
before
the
fruit
orchards
of
logan
or
the
shining
levels
of
the
salt
lake
had
been
reached
that
mayor
himself
a
gentile
and
one
renowned
for
his
dealings
with
the
mormons
told
me
that
the
great
question
of
the
existence
of
the
power
within
the
power
was
being
gradually
solved
by
the
ballot
and
by
education
all
the
beauty
of
the
valley
could
not
make
me
forget
it
and
the
valley
is
very
fair
bench
after
bench
of
land
flat
as
a
table
against
the
flanks
of
the
ringing
hills
marks
where
the
salt
lake
rested
for
awhile
in
its
collapse
from
an
inland
sea
to
a
lake
fifty
miles
long
and
thirty
broad
there
are
the
makings
of
a
very
fine
creed
about
mormonism
to
begin
with
the
church
is
rather
more
absolute
than
that
of
rome
drop
the
polygamy
plank
in
the
platform
but
on
the
other
hand
deal
lightly
with
certain
forms
of
excess
keep
the
quality
of
the
recruit
down
to
the
low
mental
level
and
see
that
the
best
of
all
the
agricultural
science
available
is
in
the
hands
of
the
elders
and
there
you
have
a
engine
for
pioneer
work
the
tawdry
mysticism
and
the
borrowing
from
freemasonry
serve
the
low
caste
swede
and
dane
the
welshman
and
the
cornish
cotter
just
as
well
as
a
highly
organized
heaven
then
i
went
about
the
streets
and
peeped
into
people
front
windows
and
the
decorations
upon
the
tables
were
after
the
manner
of
the
year
main
street
was
full
of
country
folk
from
the
desert
come
in
to
trade
with
the
zion
mercantile
institute
the
church
i
fancy
looks
after
the
finances
of
this
thing
and
it
consequently
pays
good
dividends
the
faces
of
the
women
were
not
lovely
but
for
the
certainty
that
ugly
persons
are
just
as
irrational
in
the
matter
of
undivided
love
as
the
beautiful
it
seems
that
polygamy
was
a
blessed
institution
for
the
women
and
that
only
the
dread
threats
of
the
spiritual
power
could
drive
the
hulking
men
into
it
the
women
wore
hideous
garments
and
the
men
appeared
to
be
tied
up
with
strings
they
would
market
all
that
afternoon
and
on
sunday
go
to
the
i
tried
to
talk
to
a
few
of
them
but
they
spoke
strange
tongues
and
stared
and
behaved
like
cows
yet
one
woman
and
not
an
altogether
ugly
one
confided
to
me
that
she
hated
the
idea
of
salt
lake
city
being
turned
into
a
for
the
amusement
of
the
gentiles
if
we
our
own
institutions
that
ai
no
reason
why
people
should
come
and
stare
at
us
his
it
the
dropped
h
betrayed
her
and
when
did
you
leave
england
i
said
summer
of
i
am
dorset
she
said
the
mormon
agent
was
very
good
to
us
and
we
was
very
poor
now
we
better
off
my
father
mother
an
then
you
like
the
state
she
misunderstood
at
first
oh
i
ai
livin
in
the
state
of
polygamy
not
me
yet
i
married
i
like
where
i
am
i
got
things
o
my
own
and
some
but
i
suppose
you
will
not
me
i
ai
like
them
swedes
an
danes
i
ai
got
nothin
to
say
for
or
against
polygamy
it
the
elders
business
an
between
you
me
i
do
think
it
going
on
much
longer
you
them
in
the
talkin
as
if
it
was
spreadin
all
over
america
the
swedes
they
think
it
his
i
know
it
but
you
got
your
land
all
right
oh
yes
we
got
our
land
an
we
never
say
aught
against
polygamy
o
course
father
an
mother
an
on
a
overlooking
all
the
city
stands
the
united
states
garrison
of
infantry
and
artillery
the
state
of
utah
can
do
nearly
anything
it
pleases
until
that
hour
when
the
gentile
vote
shall
quietly
swamp
out
mormonism
but
the
garrison
is
kept
there
in
case
of
accidents
the
big
farmers
sometimes
take
to
their
creed
with
wildest
fanaticism
and
in
past
years
have
made
life
excessively
unpleasant
for
the
gentile
when
he
was
few
in
the
land
but
so
far
from
killing
openly
or
secretly
or
burning
gentile
farms
it
is
all
the
mormon
dare
do
to
feebly
try
to
boycott
the
interloper
his
journals
preach
defiance
to
the
united
states
government
and
in
the
tabernacle
on
a
sunday
the
preachers
follow
suit
when
i
went
there
the
place
was
full
of
people
who
would
have
been
much
better
for
a
washing
a
man
rose
up
and
told
them
that
they
were
the
chosen
of
god
the
elect
of
israel
that
they
were
to
obey
their
priests
and
that
there
was
a
good
time
coming
i
fancy
that
they
had
heard
all
this
before
so
many
times
it
produced
no
impression
whatever
even
as
the
sublimest
mysteries
of
another
faith
lose
salt
through
constant
iteration
they
breathed
heavily
through
their
noses
and
stared
straight
in
front
of
them
impassive
as
flat
fish
vii
america
defenceless
coasts
just
suppose
that
america
were
twenty
days
distant
from
england
then
a
man
could
study
its
customs
with
undivided
soul
but
being
so
very
near
next
door
he
goes
about
the
land
with
one
eye
on
the
smoke
of
the
of
the
old
country
across
the
seas
while
with
the
other
he
squints
biliously
and
prejudicially
at
the
alien
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
sacred
heart
and
affirm
that
up
to
i
have
never
taken
three
consecutive
trips
by
rail
without
being
delayed
by
an
accident
that
it
was
an
accident
to
another
train
makes
no
difference
my
own
turn
may
come
next
a
few
miles
from
peaceful
lakewood
they
had
managed
to
upset
an
express
goods
train
to
the
detriment
of
the
flimsy
permanent
way
and
thus
the
train
which
should
have
left
at
three
departed
at
seven
in
the
evening
i
was
not
angry
i
was
scarcely
even
interested
when
an
american
train
starts
on
time
i
begin
to
anticipate
disaster
a
visitation
for
such
good
luck
you
understand
buffalo
is
a
large
village
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
inhabitants
situated
on
the
seashore
which
is
falsely
called
lake
erie
it
is
a
peaceful
place
and
more
like
an
english
county
town
than
most
of
its
friends
once
clear
of
the
main
business
streets
you
launch
upon
miles
and
miles
of
asphalted
roads
running
between
cottages
and
residences
of
those
who
have
money
and
peace
all
the
eastern
cities
own
this
fringe
of
elegance
but
except
in
chicago
nowhere
is
the
fringe
deeper
or
more
heavily
widened
than
in
buffalo
the
american
will
go
to
a
bad
place
because
he
can
not
speak
english
and
is
proud
of
it
but
he
knows
how
to
make
a
home
for
himself
and
his
mate
knows
how
to
keep
the
grass
green
in
front
of
his
veranda
and
how
to
fullest
use
the
mechanism
of
life
hot
water
gas
good
telephones
etc
his
shops
sell
him
delightful
household
fitments
at
very
moderate
rates
and
he
is
encompassed
with
all
manner
of
appliances
this
does
not
prevent
his
wife
and
his
daughter
working
themselves
to
death
over
household
drudgery
but
the
intention
is
good
when
you
have
seen
the
outside
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
of
these
homes
and
the
insides
of
a
few
score
you
begin
to
understand
why
the
american
the
respectable
one
does
not
take
a
deep
interest
in
what
they
call
politics
and
why
he
is
so
vaguely
and
generally
proud
of
the
country
that
enables
him
to
be
so
comfortable
how
can
the
owner
of
a
dainty
chalet
with
furniture
imitation
venetian
tapestry
curtains
hot
and
cold
water
laid
on
a
bed
of
geraniums
and
hollyhocks
a
baby
crawling
down
the
veranda
and
a
hose
gently
hissing
over
the
grass
in
the
balmy
dusk
of
an
august
evening
how
can
such
a
man
despair
of
the
republic
or
descend
into
the
streets
on
voting
days
and
mix
cheerfully
with
the
boys
no
it
is
the
stranger
the
homeless
jackal
of
a
stranger
whose
interest
in
the
country
is
limited
to
his
and
a
that
can
run
from
dan
to
beersheba
crying
all
is
barren
every
good
american
wants
a
home
a
pretty
house
and
a
little
piece
of
land
of
his
very
own
and
every
other
good
american
seems
to
get
it
it
was
when
my
gigantic
intellect
was
grappling
with
this
question
that
i
confirmed
a
discovery
half
made
in
the
west
the
natives
of
most
classes
marry
young
absurdly
young
one
of
my
informants
not
the
husband
i
met
on
lake
chautauqua
said
that
from
twenty
to
was
about
the
usual
time
for
this
folly
and
when
i
asked
whether
the
practice
was
confined
to
the
constitutionally
improvident
classes
he
said
no
very
quickly
he
said
it
was
a
general
custom
and
nobody
saw
anything
wrong
with
it
i
guess
perhaps
very
early
marriage
may
account
for
a
good
deal
of
the
divorce
said
he
reflectively
whereat
i
was
silent
their
marriages
and
their
divorces
only
concern
these
people
and
neither
i
travelling
nor
you
who
may
come
after
have
any
right
to
make
rude
remarks
about
them
only
only
coming
from
a
land
where
a
man
begins
to
lightly
turn
to
thoughts
of
love
not
before
he
is
thirty
i
own
that
playing
at
before
that
age
rather
surprised
me
out
in
the
west
though
they
marry
boys
and
girls
from
sixteen
upward
and
i
have
met
more
than
one
bride
of
fifteen
husband
aged
twenty
when
man
and
woman
are
agreed
what
can
the
kazi
do
from
those
peaceful
homes
and
the
envy
they
inspire
two
trunks
and
a
and
a
bit
of
pine
forest
in
british
columbia
are
not
satisfactory
any
way
you
look
at
them
i
turned
me
to
the
lake
front
of
buffalo
where
the
steamers
bellow
to
the
grain
elevators
and
the
locomotives
yell
to
the
and
the
canal
barges
jostle
the
half
a
mile
long
as
it
snakes
across
the
water
in
tow
of
a
launch
and
earth
and
sky
and
sea
alike
are
thick
with
smoke
in
the
old
days
before
the
railway
ran
into
the
city
all
the
business
quarters
fringed
the
where
the
traffic
was
largest
the
business
quarters
have
gone
to
meet
the
railroad
the
lake
traffic
still
exists
but
you
shall
find
a
narrow
belt
of
desolation
broken
windows
doors
and
streets
where
the
grass
grows
between
the
crowded
wharves
and
the
bustling
city
to
the
lake
front
comes
wheat
from
chicago
lumber
coal
and
ore
and
a
large
trade
in
cheap
excursionists
it
was
my
felicity
to
catch
a
grain
steamer
and
an
elevator
emptying
that
same
steamer
the
steamer
might
have
been
two
thousand
tons
burden
she
was
laden
with
wheat
in
bulk
from
stem
to
stern
thirteen
feet
deep
lay
the
clean
red
wheat
there
was
no
per
cent
dirt
admixture
about
it
at
all
it
was
wheat
fit
for
the
grindstones
as
it
lay
they
manoeuvred
the
of
that
steamer
directly
under
an
elevator
a
house
of
red
tin
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
then
they
let
down
into
that
a
trunk
as
if
it
had
been
the
trunk
of
an
elephant
but
stiff
because
it
was
a
pipe
of
wood
and
the
trunk
had
a
nose
to
it
and
contained
an
endless
chain
of
steel
buckets
then
the
captain
swore
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
a
gruff
voice
answered
him
from
the
place
he
swore
at
and
certain
machinery
also
in
the
firmament
began
to
clack
and
the
glittering
nose
of
that
trunk
burrowed
into
the
wheat
and
the
wheat
quivered
and
sunk
upon
the
instant
as
water
sinks
when
the
siphon
sucks
because
the
steel
buckets
within
the
trunk
were
flying
upon
their
endless
round
carrying
away
each
its
appointed
morsel
of
wheat
the
elevator
was
a
persian
well
wheel
a
wheel
squashed
out
thin
and
cased
in
a
pipe
a
wheel
driven
not
by
bullocks
but
by
much
licking
up
the
grain
at
the
rate
of
of
bushels
the
hour
and
the
wheat
sunk
into
the
while
a
man
looked
sunk
till
the
brown
timbers
of
the
bulkheads
showed
bare
and
men
leaped
down
through
clouds
of
golden
dust
and
shovelled
the
wheat
furiously
round
the
nose
of
the
trunk
and
got
a
of
glittering
steel
and
made
that
shovel
also
till
there
remained
of
the
grain
not
more
than
a
horse
leaves
in
the
fold
of
his
in
this
manner
do
they
handle
wheat
at
buffalo
on
one
side
of
the
elevator
is
the
steamer
on
the
other
the
railway
track
and
the
wheat
is
loaded
into
the
cars
in
bulk
wah
wah
god
is
great
and
i
do
not
think
he
ever
intended
gar
sahai
or
luckman
narain
to
supply
england
with
her
wheat
india
can
cut
in
not
without
profit
to
herself
when
her
harvest
is
good
and
the
american
yield
poor
but
this
very
big
country
can
upon
the
average
supply
the
earth
with
all
the
beef
and
bread
that
is
required
a
man
in
the
train
said
to
me
we
kin
feed
all
the
earth
jest
as
easily
as
we
kin
whip
all
the
now
the
second
statement
is
as
false
as
the
first
is
true
one
of
these
days
the
respectable
republic
will
find
this
out
unfortunately
we
the
english
will
never
be
the
people
to
teach
her
because
she
is
a
chartered
libertine
allowed
to
say
and
do
anything
she
likes
from
demanding
the
head
of
the
empress
in
an
editorial
to
chevying
canadian
schooners
up
and
down
the
alaska
seas
it
is
perfectly
impossible
to
go
to
war
with
these
people
whatever
they
may
do
they
are
much
too
nice
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
it
would
throw
out
all
the
passenger
traffic
of
the
atlantic
and
upset
the
financial
arrangements
of
the
english
syndicates
who
have
invested
their
money
in
breweries
railways
and
the
like
and
in
the
third
it
not
to
be
done
everybody
knows
that
and
no
one
better
than
the
american
yet
there
are
other
powers
who
are
not
ohai
band
of
the
brotherhood
china
for
instance
try
to
believe
an
irresponsible
writer
when
he
assures
you
that
china
fleet
if
properly
manned
could
waft
the
entire
american
navy
out
of
the
water
and
into
the
blue
the
big
fat
republic
that
is
afraid
of
nothing
because
nothing
up
to
the
present
date
has
happened
to
make
her
afraid
is
as
unprotected
as
a
not
internally
of
course
it
would
be
madness
for
any
power
to
throw
men
into
america
they
would
die
but
as
far
as
regards
coast
defence
from
five
miles
out
at
sea
i
have
seen
a
test
of
her
fortified
ports
a
ship
of
the
power
of
collingwood
they
have
run
her
on
a
rock
yet
would
wipe
out
any
or
every
town
from
san
francisco
to
long
branch
and
three
ironclads
would
account
for
new
york
bartholdi
statue
and
all
reflect
on
this
be
pay
up
or
go
up
round
the
entire
coast
of
the
united
states
to
this
furiously
answers
the
patriotic
american
we
should
not
pay
we
should
invent
a
columbiad
in
pittsburg
or
or
anywhere
else
and
blow
any
outsider
into
h
they
might
invent
they
might
lay
waste
their
cities
and
retire
inland
for
they
can
subsist
entirely
on
their
own
produce
meantime
in
a
war
waged
the
only
way
it
could
be
waged
by
an
unscrupulous
power
their
coast
cities
and
their
would
be
ashes
they
could
construct
their
navy
inland
if
they
liked
but
you
could
never
bring
a
ship
down
to
the
as
they
stand
now
they
could
not
with
an
ordinary
water
patrol
despatch
one
regiment
of
men
six
miles
across
the
seas
there
would
be
about
five
million
excessively
angry
armed
men
pent
up
within
american
limits
these
men
would
require
ships
to
get
themselves
afloat
the
country
has
no
such
ships
and
until
the
ships
were
built
new
york
need
not
be
allowed
a
carriage
within
her
limits
behold
now
the
glorious
condition
of
this
republic
which
has
no
fear
there
is
ransom
and
loot
past
the
counting
of
man
on
her
seaboard
alone
plunder
that
would
enrich
a
nation
and
she
has
neither
a
navy
nor
half
a
dozen
ports
to
guard
the
whole
no
man
catches
a
snake
by
the
tail
because
the
creature
will
sting
but
you
can
build
a
fire
around
a
snake
that
will
make
it
squirm
the
country
is
supposed
to
be
building
a
navy
now
when
the
ships
are

her
alliance
will
be
worth
having
if
the
alliance
of
any
republic
can
be
relied
upon
for
the
next
three
years
she
can
be
hurt

badly
hurt

blood
looking
at
the
matter
from
a
pindarris
point
of
view
dog
can
not
eat
dog
these
sinful
reflections
were
prompted
by
the
sight
of
the
beautifully
unprotected
condition
of
buffalo
a
city
that
could
be
made
to
pay
up
five
million
dollars
without
feeling
it
there
are
her
companies
of
infantry
in
a
sort
of
port
there
a
brought
over
in
pieces
from
niagara
could
get
the
money
and
get
away
before
she
could
be
caught
while
an
unarmored
guarding
toronto
could
ravage
the
towns
on
the
lakes
when
one
hears
so
much
of
the
nation
that
can
whip
the
earth
it
is
to
say
the
least
of
it
surprising
to
find
her
so
temptingly
spankable
the
average
american
citizen
seems
to
have
a
notion
that
any
power
engaged
in
strife
with
the
star
spangled
banner
will
disembark
men
from
boats
on
a
convenient
beach
for
the
purpose
of
being
shot
down
by
local
militia
in
his
own
simple
phraseology
not
by
a
darned
sight
no
ransom
at
long
range
will
be
about
the
size
of
it
cash
or
crash
let
us
revisit
calmer
scenes
in
the
heart
of
buffalo
there
stands
a
magnificent
building
which
the
population
do
innocently
style
a
everybody
comes
here
of
evenings
to
sit
around
little
tables
and
listen
to
a
orchestra
the
place
is
something
like
the
gaiety
theatre
at
simla
enlarged
twenty
times
the
light
brigade
of
buffalo
occupy
the
boxes
and
the
stage
as
it
was
at
simla
in
the
days
of
old
and
the
others
sit
in
the
parquet
here
i
went
with
a
friend
poor
or
boor
is
the
man
who
can
not
pick
up
a
friend
for
a
season
in
america
and
here
was
shown
the
really
smart
folk
of
the
city
i
grieve
to
say
i
laughed
because
when
an
american
wishes
to
be
correct
he
sets
himself
to
imitate
the
englishman
this
he
does
vilely
and
earns
not
only
the
contempt
of
his
brethren
but
the
amused
scorn
of
the
briton
i
saw
one
man
who
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
being
the
glass
of
fashion
hereabouts
he
was
aggressively
english
in
his
from
to
the
illusion
was
perfect
but
he
wore
with
buttoned
boots
with
brown
cloth
tops
not
till
i
wandered
about
this
land
did
i
understand
why
the
comic
papers
belabor
the
anglomaniac
certain
young
men
of
the
more
idiotic
sort
launch
into
and
raiment
of
english
cut
and
here
in
buffalo
they
play
polo
at
four
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
three
youths
come
down
to
the
faultlessly
attired
for
the
game
and
mounted
on
their
best
ponies
expecting
a
game
i
lingered
but
i
was
mistaken
these
three
shining
ones
with
the
very
new
yellow
hide
boots
and
the
red
silk
sashes
had
assembled
themselves
for
the
purpose
of
knocking
the
ball
about
they
smote
with
great
solemnity
up
and
down
the
grounds
while
the
little
boys
looked
on
when
they
trotted
which
was
not
seldom
they
rose
and
sunk
in
their
stirrups
with
a
conscientiousness
that
cried
out
from
afar
other
young
men
in
the
park
were
riding
after
the
english
manner
in
neatly
cut
and
light
saddles
fate
in
derision
had
made
each
youth
bedizen
his
animal
with
a
checkered
enamelled
leather
visible
half
a
mile
away
a
checkered
they
ca
do
it
any
more
than
an
englishman
by
taking
cold
can
add
that
indescribable
nasal
twang
to
his
orchestra
the
other
sight
of
the
evening
was
a
horror
the
little
tragedy
played
itself
out
at
a
neighboring
table
where
two
very
young
men
and
two
very
young
women
were
sitting
it
did
not
strike
me
till
far
into
the
evening
that
the
pimply
young
reprobates
were
making
the
girls
drunk
they
gave
them
red
wine
and
then
white
and
the
voices
rose
slightly
with
the
maidens
cheek
flushes
i
watched
wishing
to
stay
and
the
youths
drank
till
their
speech
thickened
and
their
grew
watery
it
was
sickening
to
see
because
i
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
my
friend
eyed
the
group
and
said
maybe
they
children
of
respectable
people
i
hardly
think
though
they
be
allowed
out
without
any
better
escort
than
these
boys
and
yet
the
place
is
a
place
where
every
one
comes
as
you
see
they
may
be
little
immoralities
in
which
case
they
would
be
so
hopelessly
overcome
with
two
glasses
of
wine
they
may
be
whatever
they
were
they
got
indubitably
drunk
there
in
that
lovely
hall
surrounded
by
the
best
of
buffalo
society
one
could
do
nothing
except
invoke
the
judgment
of
heaven
on
the
two
boys
themselves
half
sick
with
liquor
at
the
close
of
the
performance
the
quieter
maiden
laughed
vacantly
and
protested
she
could
keep
her
feet
the
four
linked
arms
and
staggering
flickered
out
into
the
street
drunk
gentlemen
and
ladies
as
davy
swine
drunk
as
lords
they
disappeared
down
a
side
avenue
but
i
could
hear
their
laughter
long
after
they
were
out
of
sight
and
they
were
all
four
children
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
then
recanting
previous
opinions
i
became
a
prohibitionist
better
it
is
that
a
man
should
go
without
his
beer
in
public
places
and
content
himself
with
swearing
at
the
of
the
majority
better
it
is
to
poison
the
inside
with
very
vile
temperance
drinks
and
to
buy
lager
furtively
at
than
to
bring
temptation
to
the
lips
of
young
fools
such
as
the
four
i
had
seen
i
understand
now
why
the
preachers
rage
against
drink
i
have
said
there
is
no
harm
in
it
taken
moderately
and
yet
my
own
demand
for
beer
helped
directly
to
send
those
two
girls
reeling
down
the
dark
street
to
god
alone
knows
what
end
if
liquor
is
worth
drinking
it
is
worth
taking
a
little
trouble
to
come
at
such
trouble
as
a
man
will
undergo
to
compass
his
own
desires
it
is
not
good
that
we
should
let
it
lie
before
the
eyes
of
children
and
i
have
been
a
fool
in
writing
to
the
contrary
very
sorry
for
myself
i
sought
a
hotel
and
found
in
the
hall
a
reporter
who
wished
to
know
what
i
thought
of
the
country
him
i
lured
into
conversation
about
his
own
profession
and
from
him
gained
much
that
confirmed
me
in
my
views
of
the
grinding
tyranny
of
that
thing
which
they
call
the
press
here
thus
i
but
you
talk
about
interviewing
people
whether
they
like
it
or
not
have
you
no
bounds
beyond
which
even
your
indecent
curiosity
must
not
go
he
i
have
struck
yet
what
do
you
think
of
interviewing
a
widow
two
hours
after
her
husband
death
to
get
her
version
of
his
life
i
i
think
that
is
the
work
of
a
ghoul
must
the
people
have
no
privacy
he
there
is
no
domestic
privacy
in
america
if
there
was
what
the
deuce
would
the
papers
do
see
here
some
time
ago
i
had
an
assignment
to
write
up
the
floral
tributes
when
a
prominent
citizen
had
died
i
translate
please
i
do
not
understand
your
pagan
rites
and
ceremonies
he
i
was
ordered
by
the
office
to
describe
the
flowers
and
wreaths
and
so
on
that
had
been
sent
to
a
dead
man
funeral
well
i
went
to
the
house
there
was
no
one
there
to
stop
me
so
i
yanked
the
tinkler
pulled
the
bell
and
drifted
into
the
room
where
the
corpse
lay
all
among
the
roses
and
smilax
i
whipped
out
my
and
pawed
around
among
the
floral
tributes
up
the
tickets
on
the
wreaths
and
seeing
who
had
sent
them
in
the
middle
of
this
i
heard
some
one
saying
please
oh
please
behind
me
and
there
stood
the
daughter
of
the
house
just
bathed
in
tears
i
you
unmitigated
brute
he
pretty
much
what
i
felt
myself
i
very
sorry
miss
i
said
to
intrude
on
the
privacy
of
your
grief
trust
me
i
shall
make
it
as
little
painful
as
i
but
by
what
conceivable
right
did
you
outrage
he
hold
your
horses
i
telling
you
well
she
did
want
me
in
the
house
at
all
and
between
her
sobs
fairly
waved
me
away
i
had
half
the
tributes
described
though
and
the
balance
i
did
partly
on
the
steps
when
the
stiff
came
out
and
partly
in
the
church
the
preacher
gave
the
sermon
that
was
my
assignment
i
skipped
about
among
the
floral
tributes
while
he
was
talking
i
could
have
made
no
excuse
if
i
had
gone
back
to
the
office
and
said
that
a
pretty
girl
sobs
had
stopped
me
obeying
orders
i
had
to
do
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
slowly
do
you
want
to
know
he
with
his
ready
of
course
how
do
you
regard
it
i
it
makes
me
regard
your
interesting
nation
with
the
same
shuddering
curiosity
that
i
should
bestow
on
a
pappan
cannibal
chewing
the
scalp
off
his
mother
skull
does
that
convey
any
idea
to
your
mind
it
makes
me
regard
the
whole
pack
of
you
as
heathens
real
heathens
not
the
sort
you
send
missions
to
creatures
of
another
flesh
and
blood
you
ought
to
have
been
shot
not
dead
but
through
the
stomach
for
your
share
in
the
scandalous
business
and
the
thing
you
call
your
newspaper
ought
to
have
been
sacked
by
the
mob
and
the
managing
proprietor
hanged
he
from
which
i
suppose
you
have
nothing
of
that
kind
in
your
country
oh
pioneer
venerable
pioneer
and
you
not
less
honest
press
of
india
who
are
occasionally
dull
but
never
blackguardly
what
could
i
say
a
mere
no
shouted
never
so
loudly
would
not
have
met
the
needs
of
the
case
i
said
no
word
the
reporter
went
away
and
i
took
a
train
for
niagara
falls
which
are
miles
distant
from
this
bad
town
where
girls
get
drunk
of
nights
and
reporters
trample
on
corpses
in
the
of
the
brave
and
the
free
