preface
to
the
eleventh
edition
the
first
edition
of
the
faith
of
our
fathers
was
issued
in
december
from
that
time
to
the
present
fifty
thousand
copies
of
the
work
have
been
disposed
of
in
the
united
states
canada
great
britain
and
ireland
and
in
the
british
colonies
of
oceanica
this
gratifying
result
has
surpassed
the
author
s
most
sanguine
expectations
and
is
a
consoling
evidence
that
the
investigation
of
religious
truths
is
not
wholly
neglected
even
in
this
iron
age
so
engrossed
by
material
considerations
besides
carefully
revising
the
book
the
author
has
profited
by
the
kind
suggestion
of
some
friends
and
inserted
a
chapter
on
the
prerogatives
and
sanctity
of
the
blessed
virgin
which
it
is
hoped
will
be
not
less
acceptable
to
his
readers
than
the
other
portions
of
the
work
he
is
also
happy
to
announce
that
german
editions
have
been
published
both
in
this
country
and
in
germany
he
takes
this
occasion
to
return
his
hearty
thanks
to
the
editors
of
the
catholic
periodicals
as
well
as
of
the
secular
press
for
their
favorable
notices
which
have
no
doubt
contributed
much
to
the
large
circulation
of
the
book
baltimore
of
thomas
preface
to
the
edition
it
is
very
gratifying
to
the
author
to
note
the
large
increase
in
the
sale
of
the
faith
of
our
apart
from
personal
considerations
it
is
pleasing
to
know
that
the
popular
interest
in
the
catholic
church
and
whatever
pertains
to
her
doctrines
and
discipline
is
growing
more
widespread
and
earnest
since
when
the
eleventh
revised
edition
was
given
to
the
public
there
have
been
editions
and
the
number
of
copies
sold
reaches
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
this
desire
to
understand
the
teachings
of
the
church
of
our
fathers
is
not
confined
to
our
own
country
it
is
manifest
in
other
lands
as
shown
by
the
translations
that
have
been
made
of
this
exposition
of
catholic
belief
into
french
german
spanish
italian
norwegian
and
swedish
in
the
hope
that
they
will
add
to
the
usefulness
of
the
book
several
passages
upon
doctrinal
subjects
have
been
inserted
with
these
few
remarks
the
edition
of
the
faith
of
our
fathers
is
presented
to
the
sincere
and
earnest
seeker
after
religious
truth
by
the
author
of
preface
the
object
of
this
little
volume
is
to
present
in
a
plain
and
practical
form
an
exposition
and
vindication
of
the
principal
tenets
of
the
catholic
church
it
was
thought
sufficient
to
devote
but
a
brief
space
to
such
catholic
doctrines
and
practices
as
are
happily
admitted
by
protestants
while
those
that
are
controverted
by
them
are
more
elaborately
elucidated
the
work
was
compiled
by
the
author
during
the
uncertain
hours
which
he
could
spare
from
the
more
active
duties
of
the
ministry
it
substantially
embodies
the
instructions
and
discourses
delivered
by
him
before
mixed
congregations
in
virginia
and
north
carolina
he
has
often
felt
that
the
salutary
influence
of
such
instructions
especially
on
the
occasion
of
a
mission
in
the
rural
districts
would
be
much
augmented
if
they
were
supplemented
by
books
or
tracts
circulated
among
the
people
and
which
could
be
read
and
pondered
at
leisure
as
his
chief
aim
has
been
to
bring
home
the
truths
of
the
catholic
faith
to
our
separated
brethren
who
generally
accept
the
scripture
as
the
only
source
of
authority
in
religious
matters
he
has
endeavored
to
fortify
his
statements
by
abundant
reference
to
the
sacred
text
he
has
thought
proper
however
to
add
frequent
quotations
from
the
early
fathers
whose
testimony
at
least
as
witnesses
of
the
faith
of
their
times
must
be
accepted
even
by
those
who
call
in
question
their
personal
authority
though
the
writer
has
sought
to
be
exact
in
all
his
assertions
an
occasional
inaccuracy
may
have
inadvertently
crept
in
any
emendations
which
the
venerated
prelates
or
clergy
may
deign
to
propose
will
be
gratefully
attended
to
in
a
subsequent
edition
richmond
preface
to
revised
edition
the
new
edition
of
the
faith
of
our
fathers
has
been
carefully
revised
and
enriched
with
several
pages
of
important
matter
it
is
gratifying
to
note
that
since
the
first
edition
appeared
in
up
to
the
present
time
fourteen
hundred
thousand
copies
have
been
published
and
the
circulation
of
the
book
is
constantly
increasing
the
work
has
also
been
translated
into
nearly
all
the
languages
of
europe
baltimore
introduction
my
dear
reader
this
is
the
first
time
in
your
life
that
you
have
handled
a
book
in
which
the
doctrines
of
the
catholic
church
are
expounded
by
one
of
her
own
sons
you
have
no
doubt
heard
and
read
many
things
regarding
our
church
but
has
not
your
information
come
from
teachers
justly
liable
to
suspicion
you
asked
for
bread
and
they
gave
you
a
stone
you
asked
for
fish
and
they
reached
you
a
serpent
instead
of
the
bread
of
truth
they
extended
to
you
the
serpent
of
falsehood
hence
without
intending
to
be
unjust
is
not
your
mind
biased
against
us
because
you
listened
to
false
witnesses
this
at
least
is
the
case
with
thousands
of
my
countrymen
whom
i
have
met
in
the
brief
course
of
my
missionary
career
the
catholic
church
is
persistently
misrepresented
by
the
most
powerful
vehicles
of
information
she
is
assailed
in
romances
of
the
stamp
of
maria
monk
and
in
pictorial
papers
it
is
true
that
the
falsehood
of
those
illustrated
periodicals
has
been
fully
exposed
but
the
antidote
often
comes
too
late
to
counteract
the
poison
i
have
seen
a
picture
representing
columbus
trying
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
his
design
to
discover
a
new
continent
before
certain
monks
who
are
shaking
their
fists
and
gnashing
their
teeth
at
him
it
matters
not
to
the
artist
that
columbus
could
probably
never
have
undertaken
his
voyage
and
discovery
as
the
explorer
himself
avows
were
it
not
for
the
benevolent
zeal
of
the
monks
antonio
de
marchena
and
juan
perez
and
other
ecclesiastics
as
well
as
for
the
munificence
of
queen
isabella
and
the
spanish
court
the
church
is
misrepresented
in
histories
like
foxe
s
book
of
martyrs
it
is
true
that
he
has
been
successfully
refuted
by
lingard
and
gairdner
but
how
many
have
read
the
fictitious
narratives
of
foxe
who
have
never
perused
a
page
of
lingard
or
gairdner
in
a
large
portion
of
the
press
and
in
pamphlets
and
especially
in
the
pulpit
which
should
be
consecrated
to
truth
and
charity
she
is
the
victim
of
the
foulest
slanders
upon
her
fair
and
heavenly
brow
her
enemies
put
a
hideous
mask
and
in
that
guise
they
exhibit
her
to
the
insults
and
mockery
of
the
public
just
as
jesus
her
spouse
was
treated
when
clothed
with
a
scarlet
cloak
and
crowned
with
thorns
he
was
mocked
by
a
thoughtless
rabble
they
are
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
of
her
for
truth
has
such
a
face
and
such
a
mien
as
to
be
loved
needs
only
to
be
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
dialogue
like
the
following
to
take
place
between
a
protestant
minister
and
a
convert
to
the
catholic
church
can
not
deny
that
the
roman
catholic
church
teaches
gross
worship
of
images
for
instance
admit
no
such
charge
for
i
have
been
taught
no
such
doctrines
the
priest
who
instructed
you
did
not
teach
you
all
he
held
back
some
points
which
he
knew
would
be
objectionable
to
you
withheld
nothing
for
i
am
in
possession
of
books
treating
fully
of
all
catholic
doctrines
soul
don
t
you
know
that
in
europe
they
are
taught
differently
can
not
be
for
the
church
teaches
the
same
creed
all
over
the
world
and
most
of
the
doctrinal
books
which
i
read
were
originally
published
in
europe
yet
ministers
who
make
these
slanderous
statements
are
surprised
if
we
feel
indignant
and
accuse
us
of
being
too
sensitive
we
have
been
vilified
so
long
that
they
think
we
have
no
right
to
complain
we
can
not
exaggerate
the
offense
of
those
who
thus
wilfully
malign
the
church
there
is
a
commandment
which
says
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
if
it
is
a
sin
to
bear
false
testimony
against
one
individual
how
can
we
characterize
the
crime
of
those
who
calumniate
three
hundred
millions
of
human
beings
by
attributing
to
them
doctrines
and
practices
which
they
repudiate
and
abhor
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
church
is
hated
by
those
who
learn
what
she
is
from
her
enemies
it
is
natural
for
an
honest
man
to
loathe
an
institution
whose
history
he
believes
to
be
marked
by
bloodshed
crime
and
fraud
had
i
been
educated
as
they
were
and
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
hostile
to
the
church
perhaps
i
should
be
unfortunate
enough
to
be
breathing
vengeance
against
her
today
instead
of
consecrating
my
life
to
her
defence
it
is
not
of
their
hostility
that
i
complain
but
because
the
judgment
they
have
formed
of
her
is
based
upon
the
reckless
assertions
of
her
enemies
and
not
upon
those
of
impartial
witnesses
suppose
that
i
wanted
to
obtain
a
correct
estimate
of
the
southern
people
would
it
be
fair
in
me
to
select
as
my
only
sources
of
information
certain
northern
and
eastern
periodicals
which
during
our
civil
war
were
bitterly
opposed
to
the
race
and
institutions
of
the
south
those
papers
have
represented
you
as
men
who
always
appeal
to
the
sword
and
pistol
instead
of
the
law
to
vindicate
your
private
grievances
they
heaped
accusations
against
you
which
i
will
not
here
repeat
instead
of
taking
these
publications
as
the
basis
of
my
information
it
was
my
duty
to
come
among
you
to
live
with
you
to
read
your
life
by
studying
your
public
and
private
character
this
i
have
done
and
i
here
cheerfully
bear
witness
to
your
many
excellent
traits
of
mind
and
heart
now
i
ask
you
to
give
to
the
catholic
church
the
same
measure
of
fairness
which
you
reasonably
demand
of
me
when
judging
of
southern
character
ask
not
her
enemies
what
she
is
for
they
are
blinded
by
passion
ask
not
her
ungrateful
renegade
children
for
you
never
heard
a
son
speaking
well
of
the
mother
whom
he
had
abandoned
and
despised
study
her
history
in
the
pages
of
truth
examine
her
creed
read
her
authorized
catechisms
and
doctrinal
books
you
will
find
them
everywhere
on
the
shelves
of
booksellers
in
the
libraries
of
her
clergy
on
the
tables
of
catholic
families
there
is
no
freemasonry
in
the
catholic
church
she
has
no
secrets
to
keep
back
she
has
not
one
set
of
doctrines
for
bishops
and
priests
and
another
for
the
laity
she
has
not
one
creed
for
the
initiated
and
another
for
outsiders
everything
in
the
catholic
church
is
open
and
above
board
she
has
the
same
doctrines
for
the
pope
and
the
peasant
should
not
i
be
better
qualified
to
present
to
you
the
church
s
creed
than
the
unfriendly
witnesses
whom
i
have
mentioned
i
have
imbibed
her
doctrine
with
my
mother
s
milk
i
have
made
her
history
and
theology
the
study
of
my
life
what
motive
can
i
have
in
misleading
you
not
temporal
reward
since
i
seek
not
your
money
but
your
soul
for
which
jesus
christ
died
i
could
not
hope
for
an
eternal
reward
by
deceiving
you
for
i
would
thereby
purchase
for
myself
eternal
condemnation
by
gaining
proselytes
at
the
expense
of
truth
this
friendly
reader
is
my
only
motive
i
feel
in
the
depth
of
my
heart
that
in
possessing
catholic
faith
i
hold
a
treasure
compared
with
which
all
things
earthly
are
but
dross
instead
of
wishing
to
bury
this
treasure
in
my
breast
i
long
to
share
it
with
you
especially
as
i
lose
no
part
of
my
spiritual
riches
by
communicating
them
to
others
it
is
to
me
a
duty
and
a
labor
of
love
to
speak
the
truth
concerning
my
venerable
mother
so
much
maligned
in
our
days
were
a
tithe
of
the
accusations
which
are
brought
against
her
true
i
would
not
be
attached
to
her
ministry
nor
even
to
her
communion
for
a
single
day
i
know
these
charges
to
be
false
the
longer
i
know
her
the
more
i
admire
and
venerate
her
every
day
she
develops
before
me
new
spiritual
charms
ah
my
dear
friend
if
you
saw
her
as
her
children
see
her
she
would
no
longer
appear
to
you
as
typified
by
the
woman
of
babylon
she
would
be
revealed
to
you
bright
as
the
sun
fair
as
the
moon
with
the
beauty
of
heaven
stamped
upon
her
brow
glorious
as
an
army
in
battle
you
would
love
her
you
would
cling
to
her
and
embrace
her
with
her
children
you
would
rise
up
in
reverence
and
call
her
consider
what
you
lose
and
what
you
gain
in
embracing
the
catholic
religion
your
loss
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
your
gain
you
do
not
surrender
your
manhood
or
your
dignity
or
independence
or
reasoning
powers
you
give
up
none
of
those
revealed
truths
which
you
may
possess
already
the
only
restraint
imposed
upon
you
is
the
restraint
of
the
gospel
and
to
this
you
will
not
reasonably
object
you
gain
everything
that
is
worth
having
you
acquire
a
full
and
connected
knowledge
of
god
s
revelation
you
get
possession
of
the
whole
truth
as
it
is
in
jesus
you
no
longer
see
it
in
fragments
but
reflected
before
you
in
all
its
beauty
as
in
a
polished
mirror
while
others
are
outside
criticising
the
architecture
of
the
temple
you
are
inside
worshiping
the
divine
architect
and
saying
devoutly
with
the
psalmist
i
have
loved
o
lord
the
beauty
of
thy
house
and
the
place
where
thy
glory
while
others
from
without
find
in
the
windows
only
blurred
and
confused
figures
without
symmetry
or
attraction
or
meaning
you
from
within
are
gazing
with
silent
rapture
on
god
s
glorified
saints
with
their
outlines
clearly
defined
on
the
windows
and
all
illuminated
with
the
sunlight
of
heaven
your
knowledge
of
the
truth
is
not
only
complete
and
harmonious
but
it
becomes
fixed
and
steady
you
exchange
opinion
for
certainty
you
are
no
longer
tossed
about
by
every
wind
of
doctrine
but
you
are
firmly
grounded
on
the
rock
of
truth
then
you
enjoy
that
profound
peace
which
springs
from
the
conscious
possession
of
the
truth
in
coming
to
the
church
you
are
not
entering
a
strange
place
but
you
are
returning
to
your
father
s
home
the
house
and
furniture
may
look
odd
to
you
but
it
is
just
the
same
as
your
forefathers
left
it
three
hundred
years
ago
in
coming
back
to
the
church
you
worship
where
your
fathers
worshiped
before
you
you
kneel
before
the
altar
at
which
they
knelt
you
receive
the
sacraments
which
they
received
and
respect
the
authority
of
the
clergy
whom
they
venerated
you
come
back
like
the
prodigal
son
to
the
home
of
your
father
and
mother
the
garment
of
joy
is
placed
upon
you
the
banquet
of
love
is
set
before
you
and
you
receive
the
kiss
of
peace
as
a
pledge
of
your
filiation
and
adoption
one
hearty
embrace
of
your
tender
mother
will
compensate
you
for
all
the
sacrifices
you
may
have
made
and
you
will
exclaim
with
the
penitent
augustine
too
late
have
i
known
thee
o
beauty
ever
ancient
and
ever
new
too
late
have
i
loved
should
the
perusal
of
this
book
bring
one
soul
to
the
knowledge
of
the
church
my
labor
will
be
amply
rewarded
remember
that
nothing
is
so
essential
as
the
salvation
of
your
immortal
soul
for
what
doth
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
let
not
therefore
the
fear
of
offending
friends
and
relatives
the
persecution
of
men
the
loss
of
earthly
possessions
nor
any
other
temporal
calamity
deter
you
from
investigating
and
embracing
the
true
religion
for
our
present
tribulation
which
is
momentary
and
light
worketh
for
us
above
measure
exceedingly
an
eternal
weight
of
may
god
give
you
light
to
see
the
truth
and
having
seen
it
may
he
give
you
courage
and
strength
to
follow
it
chapter
i
the
blessed
trinity
the
incarnation
etc
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
there
is
but
one
god
who
is
infinite
in
knowledge
in
power
in
goodness
and
in
every
other
perfection
who
created
all
things
by
his
omnipotence
and
governs
them
by
his
providence
in
this
one
god
there
are
three
distinct
persons
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
who
are
perfectly
equal
to
each
other
we
believe
that
jesus
christ
the
second
person
of
the
blessed
trinity
is
perfect
god
and
perfect
man
he
is
god
for
he
is
over
all
things
god
blessed
he
is
god
of
the
substance
of
the
father
begotten
before
time
and
he
is
man
of
the
substance
of
his
mother
born
in
out
of
love
for
us
and
in
order
to
rescue
us
from
the
miseries
entailed
upon
us
by
the
disobedience
of
our
first
parents
the
divine
word
descended
from
heaven
and
became
man
in
the
womb
of
the
virgin
mary
by
the
operation
of
the
holy
ghost
he
was
born
on
christmas
day
in
a
stable
at
bethlehem
after
having
led
a
life
of
obscurity
for
about
thirty
years
chiefly
at
nazareth
he
commenced
his
public
career
he
associated
with
him
a
number
of
men
who
are
named
apostles
whom
he
instructed
in
the
doctrines
of
the
religion
which
he
established
for
three
years
he
went
about
doing
good
giving
sight
to
the
blind
hearing
to
the
deaf
healing
all
kinds
of
diseases
raising
the
dead
to
life
and
preaching
throughout
judea
the
new
gospel
of
peace
on
good
friday
he
was
crucified
on
mount
calvary
and
thus
purchased
for
us
redemption
by
his
death
hence
jesus
exclusively
bears
the
titles
of
and
because
there
is
no
other
name
under
heaven
given
to
men
whereby
we
must
be
he
was
wounded
for
our
iniquities
he
was
bruised
for
our
sins
and
by
his
bruises
we
are
we
are
commanded
by
jesus
suffering
and
dying
for
us
to
imitate
him
by
the
crucifixion
of
our
flesh
and
by
acts
of
daily
mortification
if
anyone
he
says
will
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
daily
and
follow
hence
we
abstain
from
the
use
of
flesh
meat
on
day
consecrated
to
our
savior
s
because
the
eating
of
flesh
meat
is
sinful
in
itself
but
as
an
act
of
salutary
mortification
loving
children
would
be
prompted
by
filial
tenderness
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
their
father
s
death
rather
by
prayer
and
fasting
than
by
feasting
even
so
we
abstain
on
fridays
from
flesh
meat
that
we
may
in
a
small
measure
testify
our
practical
sympathy
for
our
dear
lord
by
the
mortification
of
our
body
endeavoring
like
paul
to
bear
about
in
our
body
the
mortification
of
jesus
that
the
life
also
of
jesus
may
be
made
manifest
in
our
the
cross
is
held
in
the
highest
reverence
by
catholics
because
it
was
the
instrument
of
our
savior
s
crucifixion
it
surmounts
our
churches
and
adorns
our
sanctuaries
we
venerate
it
as
the
emblem
of
our
salvation
far
be
it
from
me
says
the
apostle
to
glory
save
in
the
cross
of
our
lord
jesus
we
do
not
of
course
attach
any
intrinsic
virtue
to
the
cross
this
would
be
sinful
and
idolatrous
our
veneration
is
referred
to
him
who
died
upon
it
it
is
also
a
very
ancient
and
pious
practice
for
the
faithful
to
make
on
their
person
the
sign
of
the
cross
saying
at
the
same
time
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
tertullian
who
lived
in
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
says
in
all
our
actions
when
we
come
in
or
go
out
when
we
dress
when
we
wash
at
our
meals
before
retiring
to
sleep
we
form
on
our
foreheads
the
sign
of
the
cross
these
practices
are
not
commanded
by
a
formal
law
of
scripture
but
tradition
teaches
them
custom
confirms
them
faith
observes
by
the
sign
of
the
cross
we
make
a
profession
of
our
faith
in
the
trinity
and
the
incarnation
and
perform
a
most
salutary
act
of
religion
we
believe
that
on
easter
sunday
jesus
christ
manifested
his
divine
power
by
raising
himself
to
life
and
that
having
spent
forty
days
on
earth
after
his
resurrection
instructing
his
disciples
he
ascended
to
heaven
from
the
mount
of
olives
on
the
feast
of
pentecost
or
whitsunday
ten
days
after
his
ascension
our
savior
sent
as
he
had
promised
his
holy
spirit
to
his
disciples
while
they
were
assembled
together
in
prayer
the
holy
ghost
purified
their
hearts
from
sin
and
imparted
to
them
a
full
knowledge
of
those
doctrines
of
salvation
which
they
were
instructed
to
preach
on
the
same
feast
of
pentecost
the
apostles
commenced
their
sublime
mission
from
which
day
accordingly
we
date
the
active
life
of
the
catholic
church
our
redeemer
gave
the
most
ample
authority
to
the
apostles
to
teach
in
his
name
commanding
them
to
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
and
directing
all
under
the
most
severe
penalties
to
hear
and
obey
them
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
and
lest
we
should
be
mistaken
in
distinguishing
between
the
true
church
and
false
sects
which
our
lord
predicted
would
arise
he
was
pleased
to
stamp
upon
his
church
certain
shining
marks
by
which
every
sincere
inquirer
could
easily
recognize
her
as
his
only
spouse
the
principal
marks
or
characteristics
of
the
true
church
are
her
unity
sanctity
catholicity
and
apostolicity
to
which
may
be
added
the
infallibility
of
her
teaching
and
the
perpetuity
of
her
existence
i
shall
treat
successively
of
these
marks
chapter
ii
the
unity
of
the
church
by
unity
is
meant
that
the
members
of
the
true
church
must
be
united
in
the
belief
of
the
same
doctrines
of
revelation
and
in
the
acknowledgment
of
the
authority
of
the
same
pastors
heresy
and
schism
are
opposed
to
christian
unity
by
heresy
a
man
rejects
one
or
more
articles
of
the
christian
faith
by
schism
he
spurns
the
authority
of
his
spiritual
superiors
that
our
savior
requires
this
unity
of
faith
and
government
in
his
members
is
evident
from
various
passages
of
holy
writ
in
his
admirable
prayer
immediately
before
his
passion
he
says
i
pray
for
them
also
who
through
their
word
shall
believe
in
me
that
they
all
may
be
one
as
thou
father
in
me
and
i
in
thee
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us
that
the
world
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
because
the
unity
of
the
church
is
the
most
luminous
evidence
of
the
divine
mission
of
christ
jesus
prayed
that
his
followers
may
be
united
in
the
bond
of
a
common
faith
as
he
and
his
father
are
united
in
essence
and
certainly
the
prayer
of
jesus
is
always
heard
paul
ranks
schism
and
heresy
with
the
crimes
of
murder
and
idolatry
and
he
declares
that
the
authors
of
sects
shall
not
possess
the
kingdom
of
god
he
also
addresses
a
letter
to
the
ephesians
from
his
prison
in
rome
and
if
the
words
of
the
apostle
should
always
command
our
homage
with
how
much
reverence
are
they
to
be
received
when
he
writes
in
chains
from
the
imperial
city
in
this
epistle
he
insists
upon
unity
of
faith
in
the
following
emphatic
language
be
careful
to
keep
the
unity
of
the
spirit
in
the
bond
of
peace
one
body
and
one
spirit
as
you
are
called
in
one
hope
of
your
calling
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
god
and
father
of
all
who
is
above
all
and
through
all
and
in
us
as
you
all
he
says
worship
one
god
and
not
many
gods
as
you
acknowledge
the
same
divine
mediator
of
redemption
and
not
many
mediators
as
you
are
sanctified
by
the
same
divine
spirit
and
not
by
many
spirits
as
you
all
hope
for
the
same
heaven
and
not
different
heavens
so
must
you
all
profess
the
same
faith
unity
of
government
is
not
less
essential
to
the
church
of
christ
than
unity
of
doctrine
our
divine
saviour
never
speaks
of
his
churches
but
of
his
he
does
not
say
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
churches
but
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
from
which
words
we
must
conclude
that
it
never
was
his
intention
to
establish
or
to
sanction
various
conflicting
denominations
but
one
corporate
body
with
all
the
members
united
under
one
visible
head
for
as
the
church
is
a
visible
body
it
must
have
a
visible
head
the
church
is
called
a
kingdom
he
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
forever
and
of
his
kingdom
there
shall
be
no
now
in
every
kingdom
there
is
but
king
one
form
of
government
one
uniform
body
of
which
all
are
obliged
to
observe
in
like
manner
in
christ
s
spiritual
kingdom
there
must
be
one
chief
to
whom
all
owe
spiritual
allegiance
one
form
of
ecclesiastical
government
one
uniform
body
of
laws
which
all
christians
are
bound
to
observe
for
every
kingdom
divided
against
itself
shall
be
made
our
savior
calls
his
church
a
sheepfold
and
there
shall
be
made
one
fold
and
one
what
more
beautiful
or
fitting
illustration
of
unity
can
we
have
than
that
which
is
suggested
by
a
sheepfold
all
the
sheep
of
a
flock
cling
together
if
they
are
momentarily
separated
they
are
impatient
till
reunited
they
follow
in
the
same
path
they
feed
on
the
same
pastures
they
obey
the
same
shepherd
and
fly
from
the
voice
of
strangers
so
did
our
lord
intend
that
all
the
sheep
of
his
fold
should
be
nourished
by
the
same
sacraments
and
the
same
bread
of
life
that
they
should
follow
the
same
rule
of
faith
as
their
guide
to
heaven
that
they
should
listen
to
the
voice
of
one
chief
pastor
and
that
they
should
carefully
shun
false
teachers
his
church
is
compared
to
a
human
body
as
in
one
body
we
have
many
members
but
all
the
members
have
not
the
same
office
so
we
being
many
are
one
body
in
christ
and
every
one
members
one
of
the
in
one
body
there
are
many
members
all
inseparably
connected
with
the
head
the
head
commands
and
the
foot
instantly
moves
the
hand
is
raised
and
the
lips
open
even
so
our
lord
ordained
that
his
church
composed
of
many
members
should
be
all
united
to
one
supreme
visible
head
whom
they
are
bound
to
obey
the
church
is
compared
to
a
vine
i
am
the
vine
ye
the
branches
he
that
abideth
in
me
and
i
in
him
the
same
beareth
much
fruit
for
without
me
ye
can
do
all
the
branches
of
a
vine
though
spreading
far
and
wide
are
necessarily
connected
with
the
main
stem
and
from
its
sap
they
are
nourished
in
like
manner
our
saviour
will
have
all
the
saplings
of
his
vineyard
connected
with
the
main
stem
and
all
draw
their
nourishment
from
the
parent
stock
the
church
in
fine
is
called
in
scripture
by
the
beautiful
title
of
bride
or
spouse
of
christ
and
the
christian
law
admits
only
of
one
wife
in
fact
our
common
sense
alone
apart
from
revelation
is
sufficient
to
convince
us
that
god
could
not
be
the
author
of
various
opposing
systems
of
religion
god
is
essentially
one
he
is
truth
itself
how
could
the
god
of
truth
affirm
for
instance
to
one
body
of
christians
that
there
are
three
persons
in
god
and
to
another
there
is
only
one
person
in
god
how
could
he
say
to
one
individual
that
jesus
christ
is
god
and
to
another
that
he
is
only
man
how
can
he
tell
me
that
the
punishments
of
the
wicked
are
eternal
and
tell
another
that
they
are
not
eternal
one
of
these
contradictory
statements
must
be
false
god
is
not
the
god
of
dissension
but
of
i
see
perfect
harmony
in
the
laws
which
govern
the
physical
world
that
we
inhabit
i
see
a
marvelous
unity
in
our
planetary
system
each
planet
moves
in
its
own
sphere
and
all
are
controlled
by
the
central
sun
why
should
there
not
be
also
harmony
and
concord
in
that
spiritual
world
the
church
of
god
the
grandest
conception
of
his
omnipotence
and
the
most
bounteous
manifestation
of
his
goodness
and
love
for
mankind
hence
it
is
clear
that
jesus
christ
intended
that
his
church
should
have
one
common
doctrine
which
all
christians
are
bound
to
believe
and
one
uniform
government
to
which
all
should
be
loyally
attached
with
all
due
respect
for
my
dissenting
brethren
truth
compels
me
to
say
that
this
unity
of
doctrine
and
government
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
protestant
sects
taken
collectively
or
separately
that
the
various
protestant
denominations
differ
from
one
another
not
only
in
minor
details
but
in
most
essential
principles
of
faith
is
evident
to
every
one
conversant
with
the
doctrines
of
the
different
creeds
the
multiplicity
of
sects
in
this
country
with
their
mutual
recriminations
is
the
scandal
of
christianity
and
the
greatest
obstacle
to
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
not
only
does
sect
differ
from
sect
but
each
particular
denomination
is
divided
into
two
or
more
independent
or
conflicting
branches
in
the
state
of
north
carolina
we
have
several
baptist
denominations
each
having
its
own
distinctive
appellation
there
is
also
the
methodist
church
north
and
the
methodist
church
south
there
was
the
old
and
the
new
school
presbyterian
church
and
even
in
the
episcopal
communion
which
is
the
most
conservative
body
outside
the
catholic
church
there
is
the
ritualistic
or
high
church
and
the
low
church
nay
if
you
question
closely
the
individual
members
composing
any
one
fraction
of
these
denominations
you
will
not
rarely
find
them
giving
a
contradictory
view
of
their
tenets
of
religion
protestants
differ
from
one
another
not
only
in
doctrine
but
in
the
form
of
ecclesiastical
government
and
discipline
the
church
of
england
acknowledges
the
reigning
sovereign
as
its
spiritual
head
some
denominations
recognize
deacons
priests
and
bishops
as
an
essential
part
of
their
hierarchy
while
the
great
majority
of
protestants
reject
such
titles
altogether
where
then
shall
we
find
this
essential
unity
of
faith
and
government
i
answer
confidently
nowhere
save
in
the
catholic
church
the
number
of
catholics
in
the
world
is
computed
at
three
hundred
millions
they
have
all
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
creed
they
receive
the
same
sacraments
they
worship
at
the
same
altar
and
pay
spiritual
allegiance
to
one
common
head
should
a
catholic
be
so
unfortunate
as
contumaciously
to
deny
a
single
article
of
faith
or
withdraw
from
the
communion
of
his
legitimate
pastors
he
ceases
to
be
a
member
of
the
church
and
is
cut
off
like
a
withered
branch
the
church
had
rather
sever
her
right
hand
than
allow
any
member
to
corrode
her
vitals
it
was
thus
she
excommunicated
henry
viii
because
he
persisted
in
violating
the
sacred
law
of
marriage
although
she
foresaw
that
the
lustful
monarch
would
involve
a
nation
in
his
spiritual
ruin
she
anathematized
more
recently
döllinger
though
the
prestige
of
his
name
threatened
to
engender
a
schism
in
germany
she
says
to
her
children
you
may
espouse
any
political
party
you
choose
with
this
i
have
no
but
as
soon
as
they
trench
on
matters
of
faith
she
cries
out
hitherto
thou
shalt
come
and
shalt
go
no
farther
and
here
thou
shalt
break
thy
swelling
waves
of
discord
the
temple
of
faith
is
the
asylum
of
peace
concord
and
unity
how
sublime
and
consoling
is
the
thought
that
whithersoever
a
catholic
goes
over
the
broad
world
whether
he
enters
his
church
in
pekin
or
in
melbourne
in
london
or
dublin
or
paris
or
rome
or
new
york
or
san
francisco
he
is
sure
to
hear
the
doctrine
preached
to
assist
at
the
same
sacrifice
and
to
partake
of
the
same
sacraments
this
is
not
all
her
creed
is
now
identical
with
what
it
was
in
past
ages
the
same
gospel
of
peace
that
jesus
christ
preached
on
the
mount
the
same
doctrine
that
peter
preached
at
antioch
and
rome
paul
at
ephesus
john
chrysostom
at
constantinople
augustine
in
hippo
ambrose
in
milan
remigius
in
france
boniface
in
germany
athanasius
in
alexandria
the
same
doctrine
that
patrick
introduced
into
ireland
that
augustine
brought
into
england
and
pelagius
into
scotland
and
that
columbus
brought
to
this
american
continent
and
this
is
the
doctrine
that
is
ever
preached
in
the
catholic
church
throughout
the
globe
from
january
till
jesus
christ
yesterday
and
today
and
the
same
the
same
admirable
unity
that
exists
in
matters
of
faith
is
also
established
in
the
government
of
the
church
all
the
members
of
the
vast
body
of
catholic
christians
are
as
intimately
united
to
one
visible
chief
as
the
members
of
the
human
body
are
joined
to
the
head
the
faithful
of
each
parish
are
subject
to
their
immediate
pastor
each
pastor
is
subordinate
to
his
bishop
and
each
bishop
of
christendom
acknowledges
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bishop
of
rome
the
successor
of
peter
and
head
of
the
catholic
church
but
it
may
be
asked
is
not
this
unity
of
faith
impaired
by
those
doctrinal
definitions
which
the
church
has
promulgated
from
time
to
time
we
answer
no
new
dogma
unknown
to
the
apostles
not
contained
in
the
primitive
christian
revelation
can
be
admitted
john
xiv
xv
xvi
for
the
apostles
received
the
whole
deposit
of
god
s
word
according
to
the
promise
of
our
lord
when
he
shall
come
the
spirit
of
truth
he
shall
teach
you
all
and
so
the
church
proposes
the
doctrines
of
faith
such
as
came
from
the
lips
of
christ
and
as
the
holy
spirit
taught
them
to
the
apostles
at
the
birth
of
the
christian
which
know
neither
variation
nor
decay
hence
whenever
it
has
been
defined
that
any
point
of
doctrine
pertained
to
the
catholic
faith
it
was
always
understood
that
this
was
equivalent
to
the
declaration
that
the
doctrine
in
question
had
been
revealed
to
the
apostles
and
had
come
down
to
us
from
them
either
by
scripture
or
tradition
and
as
the
acts
of
all
the
councils
and
the
history
of
every
definition
of
faith
evidently
show
it
was
never
contended
that
a
had
been
made
but
every
inquiry
was
directed
to
this
one
the
doctrine
in
question
was
contained
in
the
sacred
scriptures
or
in
the
apostolic
traditions
a
revealed
truth
frequently
has
a
very
extensive
scope
and
is
directed
against
error
under
its
many
changing
forms
nor
is
it
necessary
that
those
who
receive
this
revelation
in
the
first
instance
should
be
explicitly
acquainted
with
its
full
import
or
cognizant
of
all
its
bearings
truth
never
changes
it
is
the
same
now
yesterday
and
forever
but
our
relations
towards
truth
may
change
for
that
which
is
hidden
from
us
today
may
become
known
to
us
tomorrow
it
often
happens
says
augustine
that
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
defend
certain
points
of
catholic
doctrine
against
the
insidious
attacks
of
heretics
they
are
more
carefully
studied
they
become
clearly
they
are
earnestly
and
so
the
very
questions
raised
by
heretics
give
occasion
to
a
more
thorough
knowledge
of
the
subject
in
let
us
illustrate
this
in
the
apostolic
revelation
and
preaching
some
truths
might
have
been
contained
in
the
doctrine
that
grace
is
necessary
for
every
salutary
work
it
is
implicitly
asserted
that
the
assistance
of
grace
is
required
for
the
inception
of
every
good
and
salutary
work
this
was
denied
by
the
and
their
error
was
condemned
by
an
explicit
definition
and
so
in
other
matters
as
the
rising
controversies
or
new
errors
gave
occasion
for
it
there
were
more
declarations
of
what
was
formerly
believed
in
the
doctrine
of
the
supreme
power
of
peter
as
the
visible
foundation
of
the
church
we
have
the
assertion
of
many
rights
and
duties
which
belong
to
the
centre
of
unity
in
the
revelation
of
the
dignity
and
purity
of
the
blessed
virgin
there
is
implied
her
exemption
from
original
sin
etc
so
too
in
the
beginning
many
truths
might
have
been
proposed
somewhat
or
they
might
have
been
urgently
insisted
because
there
was
no
heresy
no
contrary
teaching
to
render
a
more
explicit
declaration
necessary
now
a
doctrine
which
is
less
clearly
not
so
proposed
may
be
overlooked
misunderstood
called
in
question
consequently
it
may
happen
that
some
articles
are
now
universally
believed
in
the
church
in
regard
to
which
doubts
and
controversies
existed
in
former
ages
even
within
the
bosom
of
the
church
those
who
err
in
belief
do
but
serve
to
bring
out
more
clearly
the
soundness
of
those
who
believe
rightly
for
there
are
many
things
which
hidden
in
the
and
when
heretics
were
cut
off
they
vexed
the
church
of
god
with
disputes
then
the
hidden
things
were
to
and
the
will
of
god
was
made
augustine
on
the
psalm
no
this
kind
of
in
we
can
and
do
admit
but
the
truth
is
not
changed
thereby
as
albertus
magnus
says
it
would
be
more
correct
to
style
this
the
progress
of
the
believer
in
the
faith
than
of
the
faith
in
the
to
show
that
this
kind
of
progress
is
to
be
admitted
only
two
things
are
to
be
proved
that
some
divinely
revealed
truths
should
be
contained
in
the
apostolic
teaching
less
clearly
explained
less
urgently
and
this
can
be
denied
only
by
those
who
hold
that
the
bible
is
the
only
rule
of
faith
that
it
is
clear
in
every
part
and
could
be
readily
understood
by
all
from
the
beginning
this
point
i
shall
consider
farther
on
in
this
work
that
the
church
can
in
process
of
time
as
occasions
arise
explain
this
is
proved
not
only
from
the
scriptures
and
the
fathers
but
even
from
the
conduct
of
protestants
themselves
who
often
boast
of
the
care
and
assiduity
with
which
they
search
the
scriptures
and
study
out
their
meaning
even
now
that
so
many
commentaries
on
the
sacred
text
have
been
published
and
why
to
obtain
more
light
to
understand
better
what
is
revealed
it
would
appear
from
this
that
the
only
question
which
could
arise
on
this
point
is
not
about
the
possibility
of
arriving
by
degrees
at
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
true
sense
of
revelation
as
circumstances
may
call
for
successive
developments
but
about
the
authority
of
the
church
to
propose
and
to
determine
that
sense
so
that
after
all
we
are
always
brought
back
to
the
only
real
point
of
division
and
dispute
between
those
who
are
not
catholics
and
ourselves
namely
to
the
authority
of
the
church
of
which
i
shall
have
more
to
say
hereafter
i
can
not
conclude
better
than
by
quoting
the
words
of
vincent
of
lerins
let
us
take
care
that
it
be
with
us
in
matters
of
religion
which
affect
our
souls
as
it
is
with
material
bodies
which
as
time
goes
on
pass
through
successive
phases
of
growth
and
development
and
multiply
their
years
but
yet
remain
always
the
same
individual
bodies
as
they
were
in
the
beginning
it
very
properly
follows
from
the
nature
of
things
that
with
a
perfect
agreement
and
consistency
between
the
beginnings
and
the
final
results
when
we
reap
the
harvest
of
dogmatic
truth
which
has
sprung
from
the
seeds
of
doctrine
sown
in
the
of
the
church
s
existence
we
should
find
no
substantial
difference
between
the
grain
which
was
first
planted
and
that
which
we
now
gather
for
though
the
germs
of
the
early
faith
have
in
some
respects
been
evolved
in
the
course
of
time
and
still
receive
nourishment
and
culture
yet
nothing
in
them
that
is
substantial
can
ever
suffer
change
the
church
of
christ
is
a
faithful
and
ever
watchful
guardian
of
the
dogmas
which
have
been
committed
to
her
charge
in
this
sacred
deposit
she
changes
nothing
she
takes
nothing
from
it
she
adds
nothing
to
chapter
iii
the
holiness
of
the
church
holiness
is
also
a
mark
of
the
true
church
for
in
the
creed
we
say
i
believe
in
the
catholic
every
society
is
founded
for
a
special
object
one
society
is
formed
with
the
view
of
cultivating
social
intercourse
among
its
members
a
second
is
organized
to
advance
their
temporal
interests
and
a
third
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
literary
pursuits
the
catholic
church
is
a
society
founded
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
for
the
sanctification
of
its
members
hence
peter
calls
the
christians
of
his
time
a
chosen
generation
a
royal
priesthood
holy
a
purchased
the
example
of
our
divine
founder
jesus
christ
the
sublime
moral
lessons
he
has
taught
us
the
sacraments
he
has
tend
to
our
sanctification
they
all
concentre
themselves
in
our
soul
like
so
many
heavenly
rays
to
enlighten
and
inflame
it
with
the
fire
of
devotion
when
the
church
speaks
to
us
of
the
attributes
of
our
lord
of
his
justice
and
mercy
and
sanctity
and
truth
her
object
is
not
merely
to
extol
the
divine
perfections
but
also
to
exhort
us
to
imitate
them
and
to
be
like
him
just
and
merciful
holy
and
truthful
behold
the
sublime
model
that
is
placed
before
us
it
is
not
man
nor
angel
nor
archangel
but
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
who
is
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
the
figure
of
his
the
church
places
his
image
over
our
altars
admonishing
us
to
look
and
do
according
to
the
pattern
shown
on
the
and
from
that
height
he
seems
to
say
to
us
be
ye
holy
for
i
the
lord
your
god
am
be
ye
perfect
even
as
your
heavenly
father
is
be
ye
followers
of
god
as
most
dear
we
are
invited
to
lead
holy
lives
not
only
because
our
divine
founder
jesus
christ
was
holy
but
also
because
we
bear
his
sweet
and
venerable
name
we
are
called
that
is
a
name
we
would
not
exchange
for
all
the
titles
of
prince
or
emperor
we
are
justly
proud
of
this
appellation
of
but
we
are
reminded
that
it
has
annexed
to
it
a
corresponding
obligation
it
is
not
an
idle
name
but
one
full
of
solemn
significance
for
a
christian
as
the
very
name
implies
is
a
follower
or
disciple
of
who
walks
in
the
footsteps
of
his
master
by
observing
his
precepts
who
reproduces
in
his
own
life
the
character
and
virtues
of
his
divine
model
in
a
word
a
christian
is
another
christ
it
would
therefore
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
if
a
christian
had
nothing
in
common
with
his
lord
except
the
name
the
disciple
should
imitate
his
master
the
soldier
should
imitate
his
commander
and
the
members
should
be
like
the
head
the
church
constantly
allures
her
children
to
holiness
by
placing
before
their
minds
the
incarnation
life
and
death
of
our
savior
what
appeals
more
forcibly
to
a
life
of
piety
than
the
contemplation
of
jesus
born
in
a
stable
living
an
humble
life
in
nazareth
dying
on
a
cross
that
his
blood
might
purify
us
if
he
sent
forth
apostles
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
whole
world
if
in
his
name
temples
are
built
in
every
nation
and
missionaries
are
sent
to
the
extremities
of
the
globe
all
this
is
done
that
we
may
be
saints
god
says
paul
gave
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
others
evangelists
and
others
pastors
and
doctors
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
building
up
of
the
body
of
christ
until
we
all
meet
unto
the
unity
of
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
the
moral
law
which
the
catholic
church
inculcates
on
her
children
is
the
highest
and
holiest
standard
of
perfection
ever
presented
to
any
people
and
furnishes
the
strongest
incentives
to
virtue
the
same
divine
precepts
delivered
through
moses
to
the
jews
on
mount
sinai
the
same
salutary
warnings
which
the
prophets
uttered
throughout
judea
the
same
sublime
and
consoling
lessons
of
morality
which
jesus
gave
on
the
are
the
lessons
which
the
church
teaches
from
january
till
december
the
catholic
preacher
does
not
amuse
his
audience
with
speculative
topics
or
political
harangues
or
any
other
subjects
of
a
transitory
nature
he
preaches
only
christ
and
him
this
code
of
divine
precepts
is
enforced
with
as
much
zeal
by
the
church
as
was
the
decalogue
of
old
by
moses
when
he
said
these
words
which
i
command
thee
this
day
shall
be
in
thy
heart
and
thou
shalt
tell
them
to
thy
children
and
thou
shalt
meditate
upon
them
sitting
in
thy
house
and
walking
on
thy
journey
sleeping
and
the
first
lesson
taught
to
children
in
our
is
their
duty
to
know
love
and
serve
god
and
thus
to
be
saints
for
if
they
know
love
and
serve
god
aright
they
shall
be
saints
indeed
their
tender
minds
are
instructed
in
this
great
truth
that
though
they
had
the
riches
of
dives
and
the
glory
and
pleasures
of
solomon
and
yet
fail
to
be
righteous
they
have
missed
their
vocation
and
are
wretched
and
miserable
and
poor
and
blind
and
for
what
doth
it
profit
a
man
if
he
gain
the
whole
world
and
lose
his
own
soul
on
the
contrary
though
they
are
as
poor
as
lazarus
and
as
miserable
as
job
in
the
days
of
his
adversity
they
are
assured
that
their
condition
is
a
happy
one
in
the
sight
of
god
if
they
live
up
to
the
maxims
of
the
gospel
the
church
quickens
the
zeal
of
her
children
for
holiness
of
life
by
impressing
on
their
minds
the
rigor
of
god
s
judgments
who
will
bring
to
light
the
hidden
things
of
darkness
and
make
manifest
the
counsels
of
the
hearts
by
reminding
them
of
the
terrors
of
hell
and
of
the
sweet
joys
of
heaven
not
only
are
catholics
instructed
in
church
on
sundays
but
they
are
exhorted
to
peruse
the
word
of
god
and
manuals
of
devotion
at
home
the
saints
whose
lives
are
there
recorded
serve
like
bright
stars
to
guide
them
over
the
stormy
ocean
of
life
to
the
shores
of
eternity
while
the
history
of
those
who
have
fallen
from
grace
stands
like
a
beacon
light
warning
them
to
shun
the
rocks
against
which
a
solomon
and
a
judas
made
shipwreck
of
their
souls
our
books
of
piety
are
adapted
to
every
want
of
the
human
soul
and
are
a
fruitful
source
of
sanctification
who
can
read
without
spiritual
profit
such
works
as
the
almost
inspired
of
by
thomas
à
kempis
the
of
rodriguez
the
of
scupoli
the
writings
of
francis
de
sales
and
a
countless
host
of
other
ascetical
authors
you
will
search
in
vain
outside
the
catholic
church
for
writers
comparable
in
unction
and
healthy
piety
to
such
as
i
have
mentioned
compare
for
instance
with
s
pilgrim
s
or
s
lives
of
the
with
s
book
of
you
lay
down
with
a
sweet
and
tranquil
devotion
and
with
a
profound
admiration
for
the
christian
heroes
whose
lives
he
records
while
you
put
aside
with
a
troubled
mind
and
a
sense
of
vindictive
bitterness
i
do
not
speak
of
the
of
common
because
the
best
part
of
it
is
a
translation
from
our
missal
protestants
also
publish
though
sometimes
in
a
mutilated
form
every
passage
in
the
original
being
carefully
omitted
which
alludes
to
catholic
doctrines
and
practices
a
distinguished
episcopal
clergyman
of
baltimore
once
avowed
to
me
that
his
favorite
books
of
devotion
were
our
standard
works
of
piety
in
saying
this
he
paid
a
merited
and
graceful
tribute
to
the
superiority
of
catholic
spiritual
literature
the
church
gives
us
not
only
the
most
pressing
motives
but
also
the
most
potent
means
for
our
sanctification
these
means
are
furnished
by
prayer
and
the
sacraments
she
exhorts
us
to
frequent
communion
with
god
by
prayer
and
meditation
and
so
imperative
is
this
obligation
in
our
eyes
that
we
would
justly
hold
ourselves
guilty
of
grave
dereliction
of
duty
if
we
neglected
for
a
considerable
time
the
practice
of
morning
and
evening
prayer
the
most
abundant
source
of
graces
is
also
found
in
the
seven
sacraments
of
the
church
our
soul
is
bathed
in
the
precious
blood
of
jesus
christ
at
the
font
of
baptism
from
which
we
come
forth
new
we
are
then
and
there
incorporated
with
christ
becoming
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
for
as
many
of
you
says
the
apostle
as
have
been
baptized
in
christ
have
put
on
and
as
the
holy
ghost
is
inseparable
from
christ
our
bodies
are
made
the
temples
of
the
spirit
of
god
and
our
souls
his
sanctuary
christ
loved
the
church
and
delivered
himself
up
for
it
that
he
might
sanctify
it
cleansing
it
by
the
laver
of
water
in
the
word
of
life
that
he
might
present
it
to
himself
a
glorious
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
thing
but
that
it
should
be
holy
and
without
in
confirmation
we
receive
new
graces
and
new
strength
to
battle
against
the
temptations
of
life
in
the
eucharist
we
are
fed
with
the
living
bread
which
cometh
down
from
heaven
in
penance
are
washed
away
the
stains
we
have
contracted
after
baptism
are
we
called
to
the
sacred
ministry
or
to
the
married
state
we
find
in
the
sacraments
of
orders
and
matrimony
ample
graces
corresponding
with
the
condition
of
life
which
we
have
embraced
and
our
last
illness
is
consoled
by
extreme
unction
wherein
we
receive
the
divine
succor
necessary
to
fortify
and
purify
us
before
departing
from
this
world
in
a
word
the
church
like
a
watchful
mother
accompanies
us
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
supplying
us
at
each
step
with
the
medicine
of
life
and
immortality
as
the
church
offers
to
her
children
the
strongest
motives
and
the
most
powerful
means
for
attaining
to
sanctity
of
life
so
does
she
reap
among
them
the
most
abundant
fruits
of
holiness
in
every
age
and
country
she
is
the
fruitful
mother
of
saints
our
ecclesiastical
calendar
is
not
confined
to
the
names
of
the
twelve
apostles
it
is
emblazoned
with
the
lists
of
heroic
martyrs
who
were
stoned
and
cut
asunder
and
put
to
death
by
the
sword
of
innumerable
confessors
and
hermits
who
left
all
things
and
followed
christ
of
spotless
virgins
who
preserved
their
chastity
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
sake
every
day
in
the
year
is
consecrated
in
our
martyrology
to
a
large
number
of
saints
and
in
our
own
times
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
and
in
every
department
of
life
the
church
continues
to
raise
up
saints
worthy
of
the
primitive
days
of
christianity
if
we
seek
for
we
find
them
conspicuously
among
the
bishops
of
germany
who
are
now
displaying
in
prison
and
in
exile
a
serene
heroism
worthy
of
peter
and
paul
every
year
records
the
tortures
of
catholic
missioners
who
die
to
the
faith
in
china
corea
and
other
pagan
countries
among
her
are
numbered
those
devoted
priests
who
abandoning
home
and
family
ties
annually
go
forth
to
preach
the
gospel
in
foreign
lands
their
worldly
possessions
are
often
confined
to
a
few
books
of
devotion
and
their
modest
apparel
and
who
is
a
stranger
to
her
consecrated
those
sisters
of
various
orders
who
in
every
large
city
of
christendom
are
daily
reclaiming
degraded
women
from
a
life
of
shame
and
bringing
them
back
to
the
sweet
influences
of
religion
who
snatch
the
abandoned
offspring
of
sin
from
temporal
and
spiritual
death
and
make
them
pious
and
useful
members
of
society
becoming
more
than
mothers
to
them
who
rescue
children
from
ignorance
and
instill
into
their
minds
the
knowledge
and
love
of
god
we
can
point
to
numberless
saints
also
among
the
laity
i
dare
assert
that
in
almost
every
congregation
in
the
catholic
world
men
and
women
are
to
be
found
who
exhibit
a
fervent
piety
and
a
zeal
for
religion
which
render
them
worthy
of
being
named
after
the
and
the
of
the
new
testament
they
attract
not
indeed
the
admiration
of
the
public
because
true
piety
is
unostentatious
and
seeks
a
life
hidden
with
christ
in
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
in
proclaiming
the
sanctity
of
the
church
i
am
attempting
to
prove
that
all
catholics
are
holy
i
am
sorry
to
confess
that
corruption
of
morals
is
too
often
found
among
professing
catholics
we
can
not
close
our
eyes
to
the
painful
fact
that
too
many
of
them
far
from
living
up
to
the
teachings
of
their
church
are
sources
of
melancholy
scandal
it
must
be
that
scandals
come
but
woe
to
him
by
whom
the
scandal
i
also
admit
that
the
sin
of
catholics
is
more
heinous
in
the
sight
of
god
than
that
of
their
separated
brethren
because
they
abuse
more
grace
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
neither
god
nor
his
church
forces
any
man
s
conscience
to
all
he
says
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophet
behold
i
set
before
you
the
way
of
life
and
the
way
of
jer
xxi
the
choice
rests
with
yourselves
it
is
easy
to
explain
why
so
many
disedifying
members
are
always
found
clinging
to
the
robes
of
the
church
their
spiritual
mother
and
why
she
never
shakes
them
off
nor
disowns
them
as
her
children
the
church
is
animated
by
the
spirit
of
her
founder
jesus
christ
he
came
into
this
world
to
save
he
came
not
to
call
the
just
but
sinners
to
he
was
the
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
that
he
might
make
them
the
friends
of
god
and
they
clung
to
him
knowing
his
compassion
for
them
the
church
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
her
divine
spouse
never
repudiates
sinners
nor
cuts
them
off
from
her
fold
no
matter
how
grievous
or
notorious
may
be
their
moral
delinquencies
not
because
she
connives
at
their
sin
but
because
she
wishes
to
reclaim
them
she
bids
them
never
to
despair
and
tries
at
least
to
weaken
their
passions
if
she
can
not
altogether
reform
their
lives
mindful
also
of
the
words
of
our
lord
the
poor
have
the
gospel
preached
to
them
the
church
has
a
tender
compassion
for
the
victims
of
poverty
which
has
its
train
of
peculiar
temptations
and
infirmities
hence
the
poor
and
the
sinners
cling
to
the
church
as
they
clung
to
our
lord
during
his
mortal
life
we
know
on
the
other
hand
that
sinners
who
are
guilty
of
gross
crimes
which
shock
public
decency
are
virtually
excommunicated
from
protestant
communions
and
as
for
the
poor
the
public
press
often
complains
that
little
or
no
provision
is
made
for
them
in
protestant
churches
a
gentleman
informed
me
that
he
never
saw
a
poor
person
enter
an
episcopal
church
which
was
contiguous
to
his
residence
these
excluded
sinners
and
victims
of
penury
either
abandon
christianity
altogether
or
find
refuge
in
the
bosom
of
their
true
mother
the
catholic
church
who
like
her
divine
spouse
claims
the
afflicted
as
her
most
cherished
inheritance
the
parables
descriptive
of
this
church
which
our
lord
employed
also
clearly
teach
us
that
the
good
and
bad
shall
be
joined
together
in
the
church
as
long
as
her
earthly
mission
lasts
the
kingdom
of
god
is
like
a
field
in
which
the
cockle
is
allowed
to
grow
up
with
the
good
seed
until
the
it
is
like
a
net
which
encloses
good
fish
and
bad
until
the
hour
of
separation
comes
so
too
the
church
is
that
great
house
in
which
there
are
not
only
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
but
also
of
wood
and
clay
the
fathers
repeat
the
teaching
of
scripture
jerome
says
the
ark
of
noah
was
a
type
of
the
church
as
every
kind
of
animal
was
in
that
so
in
this
there
are
men
of
every
race
and
character
as
in
that
were
the
leopard
and
the
kids
the
wolf
and
the
lambs
so
in
this
there
are
to
be
found
the
just
and
the
is
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
along
with
those
of
wood
and
gregory
the
great
writes
because
in
it
the
church
the
good
are
mingled
with
the
bad
the
reprobate
with
the
elect
it
is
rightly
declared
to
be
similar
to
the
wise
and
the
foolish
listen
to
augustine
let
the
mind
recall
the
containing
straw
and
wheat
the
nets
in
which
are
inclosed
good
and
bad
fish
the
ark
of
noah
in
which
were
clean
and
unclean
animals
and
you
will
see
that
the
church
from
now
until
the
judgment
day
not
only
sheep
and
is
saintly
laymen
and
holy
also
the
beasts
of
the
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
are
men
who
take
delight
in
carnal
pleasures
field
being
that
broad
way
which
leads
to
the
occasional
scandals
existing
among
members
of
the
church
do
not
invalidate
or
impair
her
claim
to
the
title
of
sanctity
the
spots
on
the
sun
do
not
mar
his
brightness
neither
do
the
moral
stains
of
some
members
sully
the
brilliancy
of
her
who
cometh
forth
as
the
morning
star
fair
as
the
moon
bright
as
the
the
cockle
that
grows
amidst
the
wheat
does
not
destroy
the
beauty
of
the
ripened
harvest
the
sanctity
of
jesus
was
not
sullied
by
the
presence
of
judas
in
the
apostolic
college
neither
can
the
moral
corruption
of
a
few
disciples
tarnish
the
holiness
of
the
church
paul
calls
the
church
of
corinth
a
congregation
of
saints
though
he
reproves
some
scandalous
members
among
them
it
can
not
be
denied
that
corruption
of
morals
prevailed
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
such
an
extent
as
to
call
for
a
sweeping
reformation
and
that
laxity
of
discipline
invaded
even
the
sanctuary
but
how
was
this
reformation
of
morals
to
be
effected
was
it
to
be
accomplished
by
a
force
operating
inside
the
church
or
outside
i
answer
that
the
proper
way
of
carrying
out
this
reformation
was
by
battling
against
iniquity
within
the
church
for
there
was
not
a
single
weapon
which
men
could
use
in
waging
war
with
vice
outside
the
church
which
they
could
not
wield
with
more
effective
power
when
fighting
under
the
authority
of
the
church
the
true
weapons
of
an
apostle
at
all
times
have
been
personal
virtue
prayer
preaching
and
the
sacraments
every
genuine
reformer
had
those
weapons
at
his
disposal
within
the
church
she
possesses
at
all
times
not
only
the
principle
of
undying
vitality
but
besides
all
the
elements
of
reformation
and
all
the
means
of
sanctification
with
the
weapons
i
have
named
she
purified
morals
in
the
first
century
and
with
the
same
weapons
she
went
to
work
with
a
right
good
will
and
effected
a
moral
reformation
in
the
sixteenth
century
she
was
the
only
effectual
spiritual
reformer
of
that
age
what
was
the
council
of
trent
but
a
great
reforming
tribunal
most
of
its
decrees
are
directed
to
the
reformation
of
abuses
among
the
clergy
and
the
laity
and
the
salutary
fruits
of
its
legislation
are
reaped
even
to
this
day
charles
borromeo
the
nephew
of
a
reigning
pope
was
the
greatest
reformer
of
his
time
his
whole
episcopal
career
was
spent
in
elevating
the
morals
of
his
clergy
and
people
bartholomew
archbishop
of
braga
in
portugal
preached
an
incessant
crusade
against
iniquity
in
high
and
low
places
ignatius
of
loyola
and
alphonsus
with
their
companions
were
conspicuous
and
successful
reformers
throughout
europe
philip
neri
was
called
the
modern
apostle
of
rome
because
of
his
happy
efforts
in
dethroning
vice
in
that
city
all
these
catholic
apostles
preach
by
example
as
well
as
by
word
how
do
luther
and
calvin
and
zuinglius
and
knox
and
henry
viii
compare
with
these
genuine
and
saintly
reformers
both
as
to
their
moral
character
and
the
fruit
or
their
labors
the
private
lives
of
these
were
stained
by
cruelty
rapine
and
licentiousness
and
as
the
result
of
their
propagandism
history
records
civil
wars
and
bloodshed
and
bitter
religious
strife
and
the
dismemberment
of
christianity
into
a
thousand
sects
instead
of
with
the
lawful
authorities
in
extinguishing
the
flames
which
the
passions
of
men
had
enkindled
in
the
city
of
god
these
faithless
citizens
fly
from
the
citadel
which
they
had
vowed
to
defend
then
joining
the
enemy
they
hasten
back
to
fan
the
conflagration
and
to
increase
the
commotion
and
they
overturn
the
very
altars
before
which
they
previously
sacrificed
as
consecrated
priests
they
sanctioned
rebellion
by
undermining
the
principle
of
authority
what
a
noble
opportunity
they
lost
of
earning
for
themselves
immortal
honors
from
god
and
man
if
instead
of
raising
the
standard
of
revolt
they
had
waged
war
upon
their
own
passions
and
fought
with
the
catholic
reformers
against
impiety
they
would
be
hailed
as
true
soldiers
of
the
cross
they
would
be
welcomed
by
the
pope
the
bishops
and
clergy
and
by
all
good
men
they
might
be
honored
today
on
our
altars
and
might
have
a
niche
in
our
temples
side
by
side
with
those
of
charles
borromeo
and
ignatius
loyola
and
instead
of
a
divided
army
of
christians
we
should
behold
today
a
united
christendom
spreading
itself
irresistibly
from
nation
to
nation
and
bringing
all
kingdoms
to
the
knowledge
of
jesus
christ
chapter
iv
catholicity
that
catholicity
is
a
prominent
note
of
the
church
is
evident
from
the
apostles
creed
which
says
i
believe
in
the
holy
the
word
or
universal
signifies
that
the
true
church
is
not
circumscribed
in
its
extent
like
human
empires
nor
confined
to
one
race
of
people
like
the
jewish
church
but
that
she
is
diffused
over
every
nation
of
the
globe
and
counts
her
children
among
all
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues
of
the
earth
this
glorious
church
is
foreshadowed
by
the
psalmist
when
he
sings
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
be
converted
to
the
lord
and
all
the
kindreds
of
the
gentiles
shall
adore
in
his
sight
for
the
kingdom
is
the
lord
s
and
he
shall
have
dominion
over
the
the
prophet
malachy
saw
in
the
distant
future
this
church
when
he
wrote
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
the
going
down
my
name
is
great
among
the
gentiles
and
in
there
is
sacrifice
and
there
is
offered
to
my
name
a
clean
oblation
for
my
name
is
great
among
the
gentiles
saith
the
lord
of
when
our
savior
gave
commission
to
his
apostles
he
assigned
to
them
the
whole
world
as
the
theatre
of
their
labors
and
the
entire
human
race
without
regard
to
language
color
or
nationality
as
the
audience
to
whom
they
were
to
preach
unlike
the
religion
of
the
jewish
people
which
was
national
or
that
of
the
mohammedans
which
is
local
the
catholic
religion
was
to
be
cosmopolitan
embracing
all
nations
and
all
countries
this
is
evident
from
the
following
passages
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
go
ye
into
the
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judea
and
samaria
and
even
the
uttermost
part
of
the
these
prophecies
declaring
that
the
church
was
to
be
and
to
embrace
even
the
gentile
nations
may
not
strike
us
today
as
especially
remarkable
accustomed
as
we
are
now
to
meet
with
christian
civilization
everywhere
and
to
see
the
nations
of
the
world
bound
so
closely
together
by
social
and
commercial
relations
but
we
must
remember
that
when
they
were
uttered
the
true
god
was
known
and
adored
only
in
an
obscure
almost
isolated
corner
of
the
earth
while
triumphant
idolatry
was
the
otherwise
universal
religion
of
the
world
the
prophecies
were
fulfilled
the
apostles
scattered
themselves
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
preaching
the
gospel
of
christ
their
sound
says
paul
went
over
all
the
earth
and
their
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
whole
within
thirty
years
after
our
savior
s
crucifixion
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
was
able
to
say
to
the
romans
i
give
thanks
to
my
god
through
jesus
christ
because
your
faith
is
spoken
of
in
the
entire
world
of
assuredly
by
those
who
were
in
sympathy
and
communion
with
the
faith
of
the
romans
justin
martyr
was
able
to
say
about
one
hundred
years
after
christ
that
there
was
no
race
of
men
whether
barbarians
or
greeks
or
any
other
people
of
what
name
soever
among
whom
the
name
of
jesus
christ
was
not
invoked
irenaeus
writing
at
the
end
of
the
second
century
tells
us
that
the
religion
so
marvelously
propagated
throughout
the
whole
world
was
not
a
vague
form
of
christianity
but
that
this
faith
and
doctrine
and
tradition
preached
throughout
the
globe
is
as
uniform
as
if
the
church
consisted
of
one
family
possessing
one
soul
one
heart
and
as
if
she
had
but
one
mouth
for
though
the
languages
of
the
world
are
dissimilar
her
doctrine
is
the
same
the
churches
founded
in
germany
in
the
celtic
nations
in
the
east
in
egypt
in
lybia
and
in
the
centres
of
civilization
do
not
differ
from
each
other
but
as
the
sun
gives
the
same
light
throughout
the
world
so
does
the
light
of
faith
shine
everywhere
the
same
and
enlighten
all
men
who
wish
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
we
are
but
of
yesterday
says
tertullian
and
already
have
we
filled
your
cities
towns
islands
your
council
halls
and
camps
the
palace
senate
forum
we
have
left
you
only
the
clement
of
alexandria
at
the
end
of
the
second
century
writes
the
word
of
our
master
did
not
remain
in
judea
as
philosophy
remained
in
greece
but
has
been
poured
out
over
the
whole
world
persuading
greeks
and
barbarians
alike
race
by
race
village
by
village
every
city
whole
houses
and
hearers
one
by
not
a
few
of
the
philosophers
and
origen
in
the
early
part
of
the
next
century
observes
in
all
greece
and
in
all
barbarous
races
within
our
world
there
are
tens
of
thousands
who
have
left
their
national
law
and
customary
gods
for
the
law
of
moses
and
the
word
of
jesus
christ
though
to
adhere
to
that
law
is
to
incur
the
hatred
of
idolaters
and
the
risk
of
death
besides
to
have
embraced
that
word
and
considering
how
in
so
few
years
in
spite
of
the
attack
made
on
us
even
to
the
loss
of
life
or
property
and
with
no
great
store
of
teachers
the
preaching
of
that
word
has
found
its
way
into
every
part
of
the
world
so
that
greek
and
barbarian
wise
and
unwise
adhere
to
the
religion
of
jesus
doubtless
it
is
a
work
greater
than
any
work
of
this
catholicity
or
universality
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
or
in
all
of
the
combined
communions
separated
from
the
roman
catholic
church
the
schismatic
churches
of
the
east
have
no
claim
to
this
title
because
they
are
confined
within
the
turkish
and
russian
dominions
and
number
not
more
than
sixty
million
souls
the
protestant
churches
even
taken
collectively
as
separate
communions
they
are
a
mere
handful
are
too
insignificant
in
point
of
numbers
and
too
circumscribed
in
their
territorial
extent
to
have
any
pretensions
to
the
title
of
catholic
all
the
protestant
denominations
are
estimated
at
million
or
less
than
of
those
who
bear
the
christian
name
they
repudiate
moreover
and
protest
against
the
name
of
catholic
though
they
continue
to
say
in
the
apostles
creed
i
believe
in
the
holy
catholic
that
the
roman
catholic
church
alone
deserves
the
name
of
is
so
evident
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
deny
it
ours
is
the
only
church
which
adopts
this
name
as
her
official
title
we
have
possession
which
is
of
the
law
we
have
exclusively
borne
this
glorious
appellation
in
troubled
times
when
the
assumption
of
this
venerable
title
exposed
us
to
insult
persecution
and
death
and
to
attempt
to
deprive
us
of
it
at
this
late
hour
would
be
as
fruitless
as
the
efforts
of
the
french
revolutionists
who
sought
to
uproot
all
traces
of
the
old
civilization
by
assigning
new
names
to
the
days
and
seasons
of
the
year
passion
and
prejudice
and
bad
manners
may
affix
to
us
the
epithets
of
and
and
but
the
calm
dispassionate
mind
of
whatever
faith
all
the
world
over
knows
us
only
by
the
name
of
there
is
a
power
in
this
name
and
an
enthusiasm
aroused
by
it
akin
to
the
patriotism
awakened
by
the
flag
of
one
s
country
so
great
is
the
charm
attached
to
the
name
of
catholic
that
a
portion
of
the
episcopal
body
sometimes
usurp
the
title
of
though
in
their
official
books
they
are
named
if
they
think
that
they
have
any
just
claim
to
the
name
of
why
not
come
out
openly
and
write
it
on
the
of
their
bibles
and
afraid
of
going
so
far
they
gratify
their
vanity
by
privately
calling
themselves
catholic
but
the
delusion
is
so
transparent
that
the
attempt
must
provoke
a
smile
even
among
themselves
should
a
stranger
ask
them
to
direct
him
to
the
catholic
church
they
would
instinctively
point
out
to
him
the
roman
catholic
church
the
sectarians
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
as
augustine
tells
us
used
to
attempt
the
same
pious
fraud
but
signally
failed
we
must
hold
fast
to
the
christian
religion
and
to
the
communion
of
that
church
which
is
catholic
and
which
is
called
catholic
not
only
by
those
who
belong
to
her
but
also
by
all
her
enemies
whether
they
will
it
or
not
the
very
heretics
themselves
and
followers
of
schism
when
they
converse
not
with
their
own
but
with
outsiders
call
that
only
catholic
which
is
really
catholic
for
they
can
not
be
understood
unless
they
distinguish
her
by
that
name
by
which
she
is
known
throughout
the
whole
we
possess
not
only
the
name
but
also
the
reality
a
single
illustration
will
suffice
to
exhibit
in
a
strong
light
the
widespread
dominion
of
the
catholic
church
and
her
just
claims
to
the
title
of
take
the
ecumenical
council
of
the
vatican
opened
in
and
presided
over
by
pope
pius
ix
of
the
thousand
bishops
and
upwards
now
comprising
the
hierarchy
of
the
catholic
church
nearly
eight
hundred
attended
the
opening
session
the
rest
being
unavoidably
absent
all
parts
of
the
habitable
globe
were
represented
at
the
council
the
bishops
assembled
from
great
britain
ireland
france
germany
switzerland
and
from
almost
every
nation
and
principality
in
europe
they
met
from
canada
the
united
states
mexico
and
south
america
and
from
the
islands
of
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
they
were
gathered
together
from
different
parts
of
africa
and
oceanica
they
went
from
the
banks
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
and
from
the
banks
of
the
jordan
the
cradle
of
christianity
they
traveled
to
rome
from
mossul
built
near
ancient
nineveh
and
from
bagdad
founded
on
the
ruins
of
babylon
they
flocked
from
damascus
and
mount
libanus
and
from
the
holy
land
sanctified
by
the
footprints
of
our
blessed
redeemer
those
bishops
belonged
to
every
form
of
government
from
the
republic
to
the
most
absolute
monarchy
their
faces
were
marked
by
almost
every
shade
and
color
that
distinguished
the
human
family
they
spoke
every
civilized
language
under
the
sun
kneeling
together
in
the
same
great
truly
could
those
prelates
exclaim
in
the
language
of
the
apocalypse
thou
hast
redeemed
us
o
lord
to
god
in
thy
blood
out
of
every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
what
the
catholic
church
lost
by
the
religious
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
the
old
world
she
has
more
than
regained
by
the
immense
accessions
to
her
ranks
in
the
east
and
west
indies
in
north
and
south
america
never
in
her
long
history
was
she
numerically
so
strong
as
she
is
at
the
present
moment
when
her
children
amount
to
about
three
hundred
millions
or
double
the
number
of
those
who
bear
the
name
of
christians
outside
of
her
communion
in
her
alone
is
literally
fulfilled
the
magnificent
prophecy
of
malachy
for
in
every
clime
and
in
every
nation
under
the
sun
are
erected
thousands
of
catholic
altars
upon
which
the
clean
oblation
is
daily
offered
up
to
the
most
high
it
is
said
with
truth
that
the
sun
never
sets
on
british
dominions
it
may
also
be
affirmed
with
equal
assurance
that
wherever
the
british
sounds
aye
and
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
there
you
will
find
the
catholic
missionary
planting
the
symbol
of
by
side
with
the
banner
of
george
quite
recently
a
number
of
european
emigrants
arrived
in
richmond
they
were
strangers
to
our
country
to
our
customs
and
to
our
language
every
object
that
met
their
eye
sadly
reminded
them
that
they
were
far
from
their
own
sunny
italy
but
when
they
saw
the
cross
surmounting
our
cathedral
they
hastened
to
it
with
a
joyful
step
i
saw
and
heard
a
group
of
them
giving
earnest
expression
to
their
deep
emotions
entering
this
sacred
temple
they
felt
that
they
had
found
an
oasis
in
the
desert
once
more
they
were
at
home
they
found
one
familiar
spot
in
a
strange
land
they
stood
in
the
church
of
their
fathers
in
the
home
of
their
childhood
and
they
seemed
to
say
in
their
hearts
as
a
tear
trickled
down
their
cheeks
how
lovely
are
thy
tabernacles
o
lord
of
hosts
my
soul
longeth
and
fainteth
for
the
courts
of
the
lord
my
heart
and
my
flesh
have
rejoiced
in
the
living
they
saw
around
them
the
paintings
of
familiar
saints
whom
they
had
been
accustomed
to
reverence
from
their
youth
they
saw
the
baptismal
font
and
the
confessionals
they
beheld
the
altar
and
the
where
they
received
their
maker
they
observed
the
priest
at
the
altar
in
his
sacred
vestments
they
saw
a
multitude
of
worshipers
kneeling
around
them
and
they
felt
in
their
heart
of
hearts
that
they
were
once
more
among
brothers
and
sisters
with
whom
they
had
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
god
and
father
of
everywhere
a
catholic
is
at
home
secret
societies
of
whatever
name
form
but
a
weak
and
counterfeit
bond
of
union
compared
with
the
genuine
fellowship
created
by
catholic
faith
hope
and
charity
the
roman
catholic
church
then
exclusively
merits
the
title
of
catholic
because
her
children
abound
in
every
part
of
the
globe
and
comprise
the
vast
majority
of
the
christian
family
god
forbid
that
i
should
write
these
lines
or
that
my
catholic
readers
should
peruse
them
in
a
boasting
and
vaunting
spirit
god
estimates
men
not
by
their
numbers
but
by
their
intrinsic
worth
it
is
no
credit
to
us
to
belong
to
the
body
of
the
church
catholic
if
we
are
not
united
to
the
soul
of
the
church
by
a
life
of
faith
hope
and
charity
it
will
avail
us
nothing
to
be
citizens
of
that
kingdom
of
christ
which
encircles
the
globe
unless
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
us
by
the
reign
of
the
holy
spirit
in
our
hearts
one
righteous
soul
that
reflects
the
beauty
and
perfections
of
the
lord
is
more
precious
in
his
sight
than
the
mass
of
humanity
that
has
no
spiritual
life
and
is
dead
to
the
inspirations
of
grace
the
patriarch
abraham
was
dearer
to
jehovah
than
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
corrupt
city
of
sodom
elias
was
of
greater
worth
before
the
almighty
than
the
four
hundred
prophets
of
baal
who
ate
at
the
table
of
jezabel
the
apostles
with
the
little
band
of
disciples
that
were
assembled
in
jerusalem
after
our
lord
s
ascension
were
more
esteemed
by
him
than
the
great
roman
empire
which
was
seated
in
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
while
we
rejoice
then
in
the
inestimable
blessing
of
being
incorporated
in
the
visible
body
of
the
catholic
church
whose
spiritual
treasures
are
inexhaustible
let
us
rejoice
still
more
that
we
have
not
received
that
blessing
in
vain
chapter
apostolicity
the
true
church
must
be
apostolical
hence
in
the
creed
framed
in
the
first
ecumenical
council
of
nicæa
in
the
year
we
find
these
words
i
believe
in
the
one
holy
catholic
and
this
attribute
or
note
of
the
church
implies
that
the
true
church
must
always
teach
the
identical
doctrines
once
delivered
by
the
apostles
and
that
her
ministers
must
derive
their
powers
from
the
apostles
by
an
uninterrupted
succession
consequently
no
church
can
claim
to
be
the
true
one
whose
doctrines
differ
from
those
of
the
apostles
or
whose
ministers
are
unable
to
trace
by
an
unbroken
chain
their
authority
to
an
apostolic
source
just
as
our
minister
to
england
can
exercise
no
authority
in
that
country
unless
he
is
duly
commissioned
by
our
government
and
represents
its
views
the
church
says
paul
is
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
apostles
so
that
the
doctrine
which
it
propagates
must
be
based
on
apostolic
teachings
hence
paul
says
to
the
galatians
though
an
angel
from
heaven
preach
a
gospel
to
you
beside
that
which
we
have
preached
to
you
let
him
be
the
same
apostle
gives
this
admonition
to
timothy
the
things
which
thou
hast
heard
from
me
before
many
witnesses
the
commend
to
faithful
men
who
shall
be
fit
to
teach
others
timothy
must
transmit
to
his
disciples
only
such
doctrines
as
he
heard
from
the
lips
of
his
master
not
only
is
it
required
that
ministers
of
the
gospel
should
conform
their
teaching
to
the
doctrine
of
the
apostles
but
also
that
these
ministers
should
be
ordained
and
commissioned
by
the
apostles
or
their
legitimate
successors
neither
doth
any
man
says
the
apostle
take
the
honor
to
himself
but
he
that
is
called
by
god
as
aaron
this
text
evidently
condemns
all
preachers
and
reformers
for
how
shall
they
preach
unless
they
be
sent
of
course
by
legitimate
authority
and
not
directed
by
their
own
caprice
hence
we
find
that
those
who
succeeded
the
apostles
were
ordained
and
commissioned
by
them
to
preach
and
that
no
others
were
permitted
to
exercise
this
function
thus
we
are
told
that
paul
and
barnabas
had
ordained
for
them
priests
in
every
and
the
apostle
says
to
titus
for
this
cause
i
left
thee
in
crete
that
thou
shouldst
ordain
priests
in
every
city
as
i
also
appointed
even
paul
himself
though
miraculously
called
and
instructed
by
god
had
hands
imposed
on
him
lest
others
should
be
tempted
by
his
example
to
preach
without

we
now
leave
the
reader
to
judge
for
himself
which
church
enforces
the
doctrines
of
the
apostles
in
all
their
pristine
vigor
to
show
that
the
catholic
church
is
the
only
lineal
descendant
of
the
apostles
it
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that
she
alone
can
trace
her
pedigree
generation
after
generation
to
the
apostles
while
the
origin
of
all
other
christian
communities
can
be
referred
to
a
comparatively
modern
date
the
most
influential
christian
sects
existing
in
this
country
at
the
present
time
are
the
lutherans
episcopalians
methodists
presbyterians
and
baptists
the
other
protestant
denominations
are
comparatively
insignificant
in
point
of
numbers
and
are
for
the
most
part
offshoots
from
the
christian
communities
just
named
martin
luther
a
saxon
monk
was
the
founder
of
the
church
which
bears
his
name
he
was
born
at
eisleben
in
saxony
in
and
died
in
the
anglican
or
episcopal
church
owes
its
origin
to
henry
viii
of
england
the
immediate
cause
of
his
renunciation
of
the
roman
church
was
the
refusal
of
pope
clement
to
grant
him
a
divorce
from
his
lawful
wife
catharine
of
aragon
that
he
might
be
free
to
be
joined
in
wedlock
to
anne
boleyn
in
order
to
legalize
his
divorce
from
his
virtuous
queen
the
licentious
monarch
divorced
himself
and
his
kingdom
from
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
the
pope
there
is
a
close
relationship
says
d
aubigné
between
these
two
divorces
meaning
henry
s
divorce
from
his
wife
and
england
s
divorce
from
the
church
yes
there
is
the
relationship
of
cause
and
effect
bishop
short

anglican
historian

that
the
existence
of

separation
from
rome
may

praise

from
this
brief
historical
tableau
we
find
that
all
the
christian
now
existing
in
the
united
states
had
their
origin
since
the
year
consequently
the
oldest
body
of
christians
among
us
outside
the
catholic
church
is
not
yet
four
centuries
old
they
all
therefore
come
fifteen
centuries
too
late
to
have
any
pretensions
to
be
called
the
apostolic
church
but
i
may
be
told
though
our
public
history
as
protestants
dates
from
the
reformation
we
can
trace
our
origin
back
to
the
this
i
say
is
impossible
first
of
all
the
very
name
you
bear
betrays
your
recent
birth
for
who
ever
heard
of
a
baptist
or
an
episcopal
or
any
other
protestant
church
prior
to
the
reformation
nor
can
you
say
we
existed
in
every
age
as
an
invisible
your
concealment
indeed
was
so
complete
that
no
man
can
tell
to
this
day
where
you
lay
hid
for
sixteen
centuries
but
even
if
you
did
exist
you
could
not
claim
to
be
the
church
of
christ
for
our
lord
predicted
that
his
church
should
ever
be
as
a
city
placed
upon
the
mountain
top
that
all
might
see
it
and
that
its
ministers
should
preach
the
truths
of
salvation
from
the
thereof
that
all
might
hear
them
it
is
equally
in
vain
to
tell
me
that
you
were
allied
in
faith
to
the
various
christian
sects
that
went
out
from
the
catholic
church
from
age
to
age
for
these
sects
proclaimed
doctrines
diametrically
opposed
to
one
another
and
the
true
church
must
be
one
in
faith
and
besides
the
less
relationship
you
claim
with
many
of
these
seceders
the
better
for
you
as
they
all
advocated
errors
against
christian
truth
and
some
of
them
disseminated
principles
at
variance
with
and
morality
the
catholic
church
on
the
contrary
can
easily
vindicate
the
title
of
apostolic
because
she
derives
her
origin
from
the
apostles
every
priest
and
bishop
can
trace
his
genealogy
to
the
first
disciples
of
christ
with
as
much
facility
as
the
most
remote
branch
of
a
vine
can
be
traced
to
the
main
stem
all
the
catholic
clergy
in
the
united
states
for
instance
were
ordained
only
by
bishops
who
are
in
active
communion
with
the
see
of
rome
these
bishops
themselves
received
their
commissions
from
the
bishop
of
rome
the
present
bishop
of
rome
pius
is
the
successor
of
gregory
who
succeeded
pius
who
was
the
successor
of
leo
xii
and
thus
we
go
back
from
century
to
century
till
we
come
to
peter
the
first
bishop
of
rome
prince
of
the
apostles
and
vicar
of
christ
like
the
evangelist
luke
who
traces
the
genealogy
of
our
savior
back
to
adam
and
to
god
we
can
trace
the
pedigree
of
pius
ix
to
peter
and
to
christ
there
is
not
a
link
wanting
in
the
chain
which
binds
the
humblest
priest
in
the
land
to
the
prince
of
the
apostles
and
although
on
a
few
occasions
there
happened
to
be
two
or
even
three
claimants
for
the
chair
of
peter
these
could
no
more
affect
the
validity
of
the
legitimate
pope
than
the
struggle
of
two
contestants
for
the
presidency
could
invalidate
the
title
of
the
recognized
chief
magistrate
it
was
by
pursuing
this
line
of
argument
that
the
early
fathers
demonstrated
the
apostolicity
of
the
catholic
church
and
refuted
the
pretensions
of
contemporary
sectaries
irenæus
tertullian
and
augustine
give
catalogues
of
the
bishops
of
rome
who
flourished
up
to
their
respective
times
with
whom
it
was
their
happiness
to
be
in
communion
and
then
they
challenged
their
opponents
to
trace
their
lineage
to
the
apostolic
see
let
them
says
tertullian
in
the
second
century
produce
the
origin
of
their
church
let
them
exhibit
the
succession
of
their
bishops
so
that
the
first
of
them
may
appear
to
have
been
ordained
by
an
or
by
an
apostolic
man
who
was
in
communion
with
the
and
if
the
fathers
of
the
fifth
century
considered
it
a
powerful
argument
in
their
favor
that
they
could
refer
to
an
uninterrupted
line
of
fifty
bishops
who
occupied
the
see
of
rome
how
much
stronger
is
the
argument
to
us
who
can
now
exhibit
five
times
that
number
of
roman
pontiffs
who
have
sat
in
the
chair
of
peter
i
would
affectionately
repeat
to
my
separated
brethren
what
augustine
said
to
the
donatists
of
his
time
come
to
us
brethren
if
you
wish
to
be
engrafted
in
the
vine
we
are
afflicted
in
beholding
you
lying

over
the
bishops
from

church
perpetuity
or
duration
till
the
end
of
time
is
one
of
the
most
striking
marks
of
the
church
by
perpetuity
is
not
meant
merely
that
christianity
in
one
form
or
another
was
always
to
exist
but
that
the
church
was
to
remain
forever
in
its
clothed
with
those
attributes
which
god
gave
it
in
the
beginning
for
if
the
church
lost
any
of
her
essential
characteristics
such
as
her
unity
and
sanctity
which
our
lord
imparted
to
her
at
the
commencement
of
her
existence
she
could
not
be
said
to
be
perpetual
because
she
would
not
be
the
same
institution
the
unceasing
duration
of
the
church
of
christ
is
frequently
foretold
in
sacred
scripture
the
angel
gabriel
announces
to
mary
that
christ
shall
reign
over
the
house
of
jacob
and
of
his
kingdom
shall
be
no
our
savior
said
to
peter
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
our
blessed
lord
clearly
intimates
here
that
the
church
is
destined
to
be
assailed
always
but
to
be
overcome
never
in
the
last
words
recorded
of
our
redeemer
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
the
same
prediction
is
strongly
repeated
and
the
reason
of
the
church
s
indefectibility
is
fully
expressed
go
ye
teach
all
nations
and
behold
i
am
with
you
even
the
of
the
this
sentence
contains
three
important
declarations
presence
of
christ
with
his
behold
i
am
with
constant
presence
without
an
interval
of
one
day
s
i
am
with
you
all
perpetual
presence
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
consequently
the
perpetual
duration
of
the
even
to
the
consummation
of
the
hence
it
follows
that
the
true
church
must
have
existed
from
the
beginning
it
must
have
had
not
one
day
s
interval
of
suspended
animation
or
separation
from
christ
and
must
live
to
the
end
of
time
none
of
the
christian
communions
outside
the
catholic
church
can
have
any
reasonable
claim
to
since
as
we
have
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
they
are
all
of
recent
origin
the
indestructibility
of
the
catholic
church
is
truly
marvellous
and
well
calculated
to
excite
the
admiration
of
every
reflecting
mind
when
we
consider
the
number
and
variety
and
the
formidable
power
of
the
enemies
with
whom
she
had
to
contend
from
her
very
birth
to
the
present
time
this
fact
alone
stamps
divinity
on
her
brow
the
church
has
been
constantly
engaged
in
a
double
warfare
one
foreign
the
other
foreign
war
against
paganism
and
infidelity
in
civil
strife
against
heresy
and
schism
fomented
by
her
own
rebellious
children
from
the
day
of
pentecost
till
the
victory
of
constantine
the
great
over
maxentius
embracing
a
period
of
about
two
hundred
and
eighty
years
the
church
underwent
a
series
of
ten
persecutions
unparalleled
for
atrocity
in
the
annals
of
history
every
torture
that
malice
could
invent
was
resorted
to
that
every
vestige
of
christianity
might
be
eradicated
ad
leones
the
christians
to
the
was
the
popular
they
were
clothed
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
and
thus
exposed
to
be
devoured
by
dogs
they
were
covered
with
pitch
and
set
on
fire
to
serve
as
to
the
streets
of
rome
to
justify
such
atrocities
and
to
smother
all
sentiments
of
compassion
these
persecutors
accused
their
innocent
victims
of
the
most
appalling
crimes
for
three
centuries
the
christians
were
obliged
to
worship
god
in
the
secrecy
of
their
chambers
or
in
the
roman
catacombs
which
are
still
preserved
to
attest
the
undying
fortitude
of
the
martyrs
and
the
enormity
of
their
sufferings
and
yet
pagan
rome
before
whose
standard
the
mightiest
nations
quailed
was
unable
to
crush
the
infant
church
or
arrest
her
progress
in
a
short
time
we
find
this
colossal
empire
going
to
pieces
and
the
head
of
the
catholic
church
dispensing
laws
to
christendom
in
the
very
city
from
which
the
imperial
cæsars
had
promulgated
their
edicts
against
christianity
during
the
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
the
goths
and
vandals
the
huns
visigoths
lombards
and
other
immense
tribes
of
barbarians
came
down
like
a
torrent
from
the
north
invading
the
fairest
portions
of
southern
europe
they
dismembered
the
roman
empire
and
swept
away
nearly
every
trace
of
the
old
roman
civilization
they
plundered
cities
leveled
churches
and
left
ruin
and
desolation
after
them
yet
though
conquering
for
awhile
they
were
conquered
in
turn
by
submitting
to
the
sweet
yoke
of
the
gospel
and
thus
as
even
the
infidel
gibbon
observes
the
progress
of
christianity
has
been
marked
by
two
glorious
and
decisive
victories
over
the
learned
and
luxurious
citizens
of
the
roman
empire
and
over
the
warlike
barbarians
of
scythia
and
germany
who
subverted
the
empire
and
embraced
the
religion
of
the
mohamedanism
took
its
rise
in
the
seventh
century
in
arabia
and
made
rapid
conquests
in
asia
in
the
fifteenth
century
constantinople
was
captured
by
the
followers
of
the
false
prophet
who
even
threatened
to
subject
all
europe
to
their
sway
for
nine
centuries
mohamedanism
continued
to
be
a
standing
menace
to
christendom
till
the
final
issue
came
when
it
was
to
be
decided
once
for
all
whether
christianity
and
civilization
on
the
one
hand
or
mohamedanism
and
infidelity
on
the
other
should
rule
the
destinies
of
europe
and
the
world
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
the
pope
the
kingdom
of
spain
and
the
republic
of
venice
formed
an
offensive
league
against
the
turks
who
were
signally
defeated
in
the
battle
of
lepanto
in
and
if
the
cross
instead
of
the
crescent
surmounts
the
cities
of
europe
today
it
is
indebted
for
this
priceless
blessing
to
the
vigilance
of
the
roman
pontiffs
another
adversary
more
formidable
and
dangerous
than
those
i
have
mentioned
threatened
the
overthrow
of
the
church
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
i
speak
of
the
great
heresy
of
arius
which
was
followed
by
those
of
nestorius
and
eutyches
the
arian
schism
soon
after
its
rise
spread
rapidly
through
europe
northern
africa
and
portions
of
asia
it
received
the
support
of
immense
multitudes
and
flourished
for
awhile
under
the
fostering
care
of
several
successive
emperors
catholic
bishops
were
banished
from
their
sees
and
their
places
were
filled
by
arian
intruders
the
church
which
survived
the
sword
of
paganism
seemed
for
awhile
to
yield
to
the
poison
of
arianism
but
after
a
short
career
of
prosperity
this
gigantic
sect
became
weakened
by
intestine
divisions
and
was
finally
swept
away
by
other
errors
which
came
following
in
its
footsteps
you
are
already
familiar
with
the
great
religious
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
spread
like
a
tornado
over
northern
europe
and
threatened
if
that
were
possible
to
engulf
the
bark
of
peter
more
than
half
of
germany
followed
the
new
gospel
of
martin
luther
switzerland
submitted
to
the
doctrines
of
zuinglius
the
faith
was
lost
in
sweden
through
the
influence
of
its
king
gustavus
vasa
denmark
conformed
to
the
new
creed
through
the
intrigues
of
king
christian
ii
catholicity
was
also
crushed
out
in
norway
england
and
scotland
calvinism
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
voltaireism
in
the
eighteenth
had
gained
such
a
foothold
in
france
that
the
faith
of
that
glorious
catholic
nation
twice
trembled
in
the
balance
ireland
alone
of
all
the
nations
of
northern
europe
remained
faithful
to
the
ancient
church
let
us
now
calmly
survey
the
field
after
the
din
and
smoke
of
battle
have
passed
away
let
us
examine
the
condition
of
the
old
church
after
having
passed
through
those
deadly
conflicts
we
see
her
numerically
stronger
today
than
at
any
previous
period
of
her
history
the
losses
she
sustained
in
the
old
world
are
more
than
compensated
by
her
acquisitions
in
the
new
she
has
already
recovered
a
good
portion
of
the
ground
wrested
from
her
in
the
sixteenth
century
she
numbers
now
about
three
hundred
million
adherents
she
exists
today
not
an
effete
institution
but
in
all
the
integrity
and
fulness
of
life
with
her
organism
unimpaired
more
united
more
compact
and
more
vigorous
than
ever
she
was
before
the
reformation
of
the
sixteenth
century
bears
many
points
of
resemblance
to
the
great
arian
heresy
both
schisms
originated
with
priests
impatient
of
the
yoke
of
the
gospel
fond
of
novelty
and
ambitious
for
notoriety
both
were
nursed
and
sustained
by
the
reigning
powers
and
were
augmented
by
large
accessions
of
proselytes
both
spread
for
awhile
with
the
irresistible
force
of
a
violent
hurricane
till
its
fury
was
spent
both
subsequently
became
subdivided
into
various
bodies
the
extinction
of
protestantism
would
complete
the
parallel
in
this
connection
a
remark
of
de
maistre
is
worth
quoting
if
protestantism
bears
always
the
same
name
though
its
belief
has
been
perpetually
shifting
it
is
because
its
name
is
purely
negative
and
means
only
the
denial
of
catholicity
so
that
the
less
it
believes
and
the
more
it
protests
the
more
consistently
protestant
it
will
be
since
then
its
name
becomes
continually
truer
it
must
subsist
until
it
perishes
just
as
an
ulcer
disappears
with
the
last
atom
of
the
flesh
which
it
has
been
eating
but
similar
causes
will
produce
similar
results
as
both
revolutions
were
the
offspring
of
rebellion
as
both
have
been
marked
by
the
same
vigorous
youth
the
same
precocious
manhood
the
same
premature
decay
and
dismemberment
of
parts
so
we
are
not
rash
in
predicting
that
the
dissolution
which
long
since
visited
the
former
is
destined
sooner
or
later
to
overtake
the
latter
but
the
catholic
church
because
she
is
the
work
of
god
is
always
renewing
her
strength
like
the
eagle
you
ask
for
a
miracle
as
the
jews
asked
our
saviour
for
a
sign
you
ask
the
church
to
prove
her
divine
mission
by
a
miraculous
agency
is
not
her
very
survival
the
greatest
of
prodigies
if
you
beheld
some
fair
bride
with
all
the
weakness
of
humanity
upon
her
cast
into
a
prison
and
starved
and
trampled
upon
hacked
and
tortured
her
blood
sprinkled
upon
her
dungeon
walls
and
if
you
saw
her
again
emerging
from
her
prison
in
all
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
and
surviving
for
years
and
centuries
beyond
the
span
of
human
life
continuing
to
be
the
joyful
mother
of
children
would
you
not
call
that
scene
a
miracle
and
is
not
this
a
picture
of
our
mother
the
church
has
she
not
passed
through
all
these
vicissitudes
has
she
not
tasted
the
bitterness
of
prison
in
every
age
has
not
her
blood
been
shed
in
every
clime
and
yet
in
her
latter
days
she
is
as
fair
as
ever
and
the
nursing
mother
of
children
are
not
civil
governments
and
institutions
mortal
as
well
as
men
why
should
the
republic
of
the
church
be
an
exception
to
the
law
of
decay
and
death
if
this
is
not
a
miracle
i
know
not
what
a
miracle
is
if
augustin
that
profound
christian
philosopher
could
employ
this
argument
in
the
fifth
century
with
how
much
more
force
may
it
be
used
today
fifteen
hundred
years
after
his
time
but
far
be
it
from
us
to
ascribe
to
any
human
cause
this
marvelous
survival
of
the
church
her
indestructibility
is
not
due
as
some
suppose
to
her
wonderful
organization
or
to
the
policy
of
her
pontiffs
or
to
the
learning
and
wisdom
of
her
teachers
if
she
has
survived
it
is
not
because
of
human
wisdom
but
often
in
spite
of
human
folly
her
permanence
is
due
not
to
the
arm
of
the
flesh
but
to
the
finger
of
god
not
to
us
o
lord
not
to
us
but
to
thy
name
give
i
would
now
ask
this
question
of
all
that
are
hostile
to
the
catholic
church
and
that
are
plotting
her
destruction
how
can
you
hope
to
overturn
an
institution
which
for
more
than
nineteen
centuries
has
successfully
resisted
all
the
combined
assaults
of
the
world
of
men
and
of
the
powers
of
darkness
what
means
will
you
employ
to
encompass
her
ruin
i
is
it
the
power
of
kings
and
emperors
and
prime
ministers
they
have
tried
in
vain
to
crush
her
from
the
days
of
the
roman
cæsars
to
those
of
the
former
chancellor
of
germany
many
persons
labor
under
the
erroneous
impression
that
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
have
been
the
unvarying
supporters
of
the
church
and
that
if
their
protection
were
withdrawn
she
would
soon
collapse
so
far
from
the
church
being
sheltered
behind
earthly
thrones
her
worst
enemies
have
been
with
some
honorable
exceptions
christian
princes
who
were
nominal
children
of
the
church
they
chafed
under
her
salutary
discipline
they
wished
to
be
rid
of
her
yoke
because
she
alone
in
time
of
oppression
had
the
power
and
the
courage
to
stand
by
the
rights
of
the
people
and
place
her
breast
as
a
wall
of
brass
against
the
encroachments
of
their
rulers
with
calm
confidence
we
can
say
with
the
psalmist
why
have
the
gentiles
raged
and
the
people
devised
vain
things
the
kings
of
the
earth
stood
up
and
the
princes
met
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
christ
let
us
break
their
bonds
asunder
and
let
us
cast
away
their
yoke
from
us
he
that
dwelleth
in
heaven
shall
laugh
at
them
and
the
lord
shall
deride
ii
can
the
immense
resources
and
organized
power
of
rival
religious
bodies
succeed
in
absorbing
her
and
in
bringing
her
to
naught
i
am
not
disposed
to
undervalue
this
power
against
any
human
force
it
would
be
irresistible
but
if
the
colossal
strength
and
incomparable
machinery
of
the
roman
empire
could
not
prevent
the
establishment
of
the
church
if
arianism
nestorianism
eutychianism
could
not
check
her
development
how
can
modern
organizations
stop
her
progress
now
when
in
the
fulness
of
her
strength
it
is
easier
to
preserve
what
is
created
than
to
create
anew
iii
but
we
have
been
told
take
from
the
pope
his
temporal
power
and
the
church
is
doomed
to
destruction
this
is
the
secret
of
her
strength
strip
her
of
this
and
like
samson
shorn
of
his
hair
she
will
betray
all
the
weakness
of
a
poor
mortal
then
this
brilliant
luminary
will
wax
pale
and
she
will
sink
below
the
horizon
never
more
to
rise
for
more
than
seven
centuries
after
the
establishment
of
the
church
the
popes
had
no
sovereign
territorial
jurisdiction
how
could
she
have
outlived
that
period
if
the
temporal
power
were
essential
to
her
perpetuity
and
even
since
the
pope
has
been
deprived
of
his
temporalities
this
loss
however
does
not
bring
a
wrinkle
on
the
fair
brow
of
the
church
nor
does
it
retard
one
inch
her
onward
march
iv
is
she
unable
to
cope
with
modern
inventions
and
the
mechanical
progress
of
the
nineteenth
century
we
are
often
told
so
but
far
from
hiding
our
head
like
the
ostrich
in
the
sand
at
the
approach
of
these
inventions
we
hail
them
as
messengers
of
god
and
will
use
them
as
providential
instruments
for
the
further
propagation
of
the
faith
if
we
succeeded
so
well
before
when
we
had
no
ships
but
frail
canoes
no
compass
but
our
eyes
when
we
had
no
roads
but
eternal
snows
virgin
forests
and
trackless
deserts
when
we
had
no
guide
save
faith
and
hope
and
even
then
we
succeeded
so
well
in
carrying
the
gospel
to
the
confines
of
the
earth
how
much
more
can
we
do
now
by
the
aid
of
telegraph
steamships
and
railroads
yes
o
men
of
genius
we
bless
your
inventions
we
bless
you
ye
modern
discoveries
and
we
will
impress
you
into
the
service
of
the
church
and
say
fire
and
heat
bless
the
lord
lightnings
and
clouds
bless
the
lord
all
ye
works
of
the
lord
bless
the
lord
praise
and
exalt
him
above
all
the
utility
of
modern
inventions
to
the
church
has
lately
been
manifested
in
a
conspicuous
manner
the
pope
called
a
council
of
all
the
bishops
of
the
world
without
the
aid
of
steam
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
them
to
assemble
by
its
aid
they
were
able
to
meet
from
the
uttermost
bounds
of
the
earth
but
may

nineteenth
century
has
she
not
much
to
fear
from
literature
the
arts
and
sciences
she
has
always
been
the
patroness
of
literature
and
the
fostering
mother
of
the
arts
and
sciences
she
founded
and
endowed
nearly
all
the
great
universities
of

catalogue
of
which

may
allude
to

universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
the
two
most
famous
seats
of
learning
in
england
which
were
established
under
catholic
auspices
centuries
before

reformation

of

four
universities
now
existing
in
scotland
viz

should

observes
that

labors
of

our
knowledge
of
the
history
of

would
be
as
vague
today
as
our
information
regarding
the

of

there
are

are
obliged
to
go

to
consult
their

our
churches
are
not
only
temples
of
worship
but
depositories
of
sacred

for
our
intellectual
progress
we
are
in
no
small
measure
indebted
to
the

tyndall

observe

strikes
its
roots
into

gone
by

from

is
it
liberty
that

destroy

the
church
breathes
freely
and
expands
with
giant
growth
where
true
liberty
is
found
she
is
always
cramped
in
her
operations
wherever

casts
its
dark
shadow
nowhere
does
she
enjoy
more
independence

nowhere

children

we
not
positive
that
the

will
rise
tomorrow

next

and
so
on
to
the
end
of
the

why
because
god
so
ordained
when
he
established
it
in
the
heavens
and
because
it
has
never
failed
to
run
its
course
from
the
beginning
has
not
christ
promised
that
the
church
should
always
enlighten
the
world
has
he
not
so
far
fulfilled
his
promise
concerning
his
church
has
she
not
gone
steadily
on
her
course
amid
storm
and
sunshine
the
fulfilment
of
the
past
is
the
best
security
for
the
future
amid
the
continual
changes
in
human
institutions
she
is
the
one
institution
that
never
changes
amid
the
universal
ruins
of
earthly
monuments
she
is
the
one
monument
that
stands
proudly
not
a
stone
in
this
building
falls
to
the
ground
amid
the
general
destruction
of
kingdoms
her
kingdom
is
never
destroyed
ever
ancient
and
ever
new
time
writes
no
wrinkles
on
her
divine
brow
the
church
has
seen
the
birth
of
every
government
of
europe
and
it
is
not
at
all
improbable
that
she
shall
also
witness
the
death
of
them
all
and
chant
their
requiem
she
was
more
than
fourteen
hundred
years
old
when
columbus
discovered
our
continent
and
the
foundation
of
our
republic
is
but
as
yesterday
to
her
she
calmly
looked
on
while
the
goths
and
the
visigoths
the
huns
and
the
saxons
swept
like
a
torrent
over
europe
subverting
dynasties
she
has
seen
monarchies
changed
into
republics
and
republics
consolidated
into
this
has
she
witnessed
while
her
own
divine
constitution
has
remained
unaltered
of
her
we
can
truly
say
in
the
words
of
the
psalmist
they
shall
perish
but
thou
remainest
and
all
of
them
shall
grow
old
as
a
garment
and
as
a
vesture
thou
shalt
change
them
and
they
shall
be
changed
but
thou
art
always
the
and
thy
years
shalt
not
fail
the
children
of
thy
servants
shall
continue
and
their
seed
shall
be
directed
god
forbid
that
we
should
ascribe
to
any
human
cause
this
marvellous
survival
of
the
church
her
indestructibility
is
not
due
as
some
suppose
to
her
wonderful
organization
or
to
the
policy
of
her
pontiffs
or
to
the
learning
and
wisdom
of
her
teachers
if
she
has
survived
it
is
not
because
of
human
wisdom
but
often
in
spite
of
human
folly
her
permanence
is
due
not
to
the
arm
of
the
flesh
but
to
the
finger
of
god
in
the
brightest
days
of
the
republic
of
pagan
rome
the
roman
said
with
pride
i
am
a
roman
this
was
his
noblest
title
he
was
proud
of
the
republic
because
it
was
venerable
in
years
powerful
in
the
number
of
its
citizens
and
distinguished
for
the
wisdom
of
its
statesmen
what
a
subject
of
greater
glory
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
republic
of
the
church
which
has
lasted
for
nineteen
centuries
and
will
continue
till
time
shall
be
no
more
which
counts
her
millions
of
children
in
every
clime
which
numbers
her
heroes
and
her
martyrs
by
the
thousand
which
associates
you
with
the
apostles
and
saints
you
are
no
more
strangers
and
foreigners
but
you
are
with
the
saints
and
the
domestics
of
god
built
upon
the
foundation
of
the
prophets
and
apostles
jesus
christ
himself
being
the
chief
though
separated
from
earthly
relatives
and
parents
you
need
never
be
separated
from
her
she
is
ever
with
us
to
comfort
us
she
says
to
us
what
her
divine
spouse
said
to
his
apostles
behold
i
am
with
you
all
days
even
to
the
consummation
of
the
chapter
vii
infallible
authority
of
the
church
the
church
has
authority
from
god
to
teach
regarding
faith
and
morals
and
in
her
teaching
she
is
preserved
from
error
by
the
special
guidance
of
the
holy
ghost
the
prerogative
of
infallibility
is
clearly
deduced
from
the
attributes
of
the
church
already
mentioned
the
church
is
one
holy
catholic
and
apostolic
preaching
the
same
creed
everywhere
and
at
all
times
teaching
holiness
and
truth
she
is
of
course
essentially
unerring
in
her
doctrine
for
what
is
one
holy
or
unchangeable
must
be
infallibly
true
that
the
church
was
infallible
in
the
apostolic
age
is
denied
by
no
christian
we
never
question
the
truth
of
the
apostles
declarations
they
were
in
fact
the
only
authority
in
the
church
for
the
first
century
the
new
testament
was
not
completed
till
the
close
of
the
first
century
there
is
no
just
ground
for
denying
to
the
apostolic
teachers
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
which
we
live
a
prerogative
clearly
possessed
by
those
of
the
first
especially
as
the
divine
word
nowhere
intimates
that
this
unerring
guidance
was
to
die
with
the
apostles
on
the
contrary
as
the
apostles
transmitted
to
their
successors
their
power
to
preach
to
baptize
to
ordain
to
confirm
they
must
also
have
handed
down
to
them
the
no
less
essential
gift
of
infallibility
god
loves
us
as
much
as
he
loved
the
primitive
christians
christ
died
for
us
as
well
as
for
them
and
we
have
as
much
need
of
unerring
teachers
as
they
had
it
will
not
suffice
to
tell
me
we
have
an
infallible
scripture
as
a
substitute
for
an
infallible
apostolate
of
the
first
century
for
an
infallible
book
is
of
no
use
to
me
without
an
infallible
interpreter
as
the
history
of
protestantism
too
clearly
demonstrates
but
besides
these
presumptive
arguments
we
have
positive
evidence
from
scripture
that
the
church
can
not
err
in
her
teachings
our
blessed
lord
in
constituting
peter
prince
of
his
apostles
says
to
him
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
christ
makes
here
a
solemn
prediction
that
no
error
shall
ever
invade
his
church
and
if
she
fell
into
error
the
gates
of
hell
have
certainly
prevailed
against
her
the
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
affirm
that
the
church
did
fall
into
error
that
the
gates
of
hell
did
prevail
against
her
that
from
the
sixth
to
the
sixteenth
century
she
was
a
sink
of
iniquity
the
book
of
homilies
of
the
church
of
england
says
that
the
church
lay
buried
in
damnable
idolatry
for
eight
hundred
years
or
the
personal
veracity
of
our
savior
and
of
the
reformers
is
here
at
issue
for
our
lord
makes
a
statement
which
they
contradict
who
is
to
be
believed
jesus
or
the
reformers
if
the
prediction
of
our
savior
about
the
preservation
of
his
church
from
error
be
false
then
jesus
christ
is
not
god
since
god
can
not
lie
he
is
not
even
a
prophet
since
he
predicted
falsehood
nay
he
is
an
impostor
and
all
christianity
is
a
miserable
failure
and
a
huge
deception
since
it
rests
on
a
false
prophet
but
if
jesus
predicted
the
truth
when
he
declared
that
the
gates
of
hell
should
not
prevail
against
his
who
dare
deny
it
the
church
never
has
and
never
could
have
fallen
from
the
truth
then
the
catholic
church
is
infallible
for
she
alone
claims
that
prerogative
and
she
is
the
only
church
that
is
acknowledged
to
have
existed
from
the
beginning
truly
is
jesus
that
wise
architect
mentioned
in
the
gospel
who
built
his
house
upon
a
rock
and
the
rain
fell
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
they
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
jesus
sends
forth
the
apostles
with
plenipotentiary
powers
to
preach
the
gospel
as
the
father
he
says
hath
sent
me
i
also
send
going
therefore
teach
all
nations
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
preach
the
gospel
to
every
ye
shall
be
witnesses
unto
me
in
jerusalem
and
in
all
judea
and
samaria
and
even
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
this
commission
evidently
applies
not
to
the
apostles
only
but
also
to
their
successors
to
the
end
of
time
since
it
was
utterly
impossible
for
the
apostles
personally
to
preach
to
the
whole
world
not
only
does
our
lord
empower
his
apostles
to
preach
the
gospel
but
he
commands
and
under
the
most
severe
penalties
those
to
whom
they
preach
to
listen
and
obey
whosoever
will
not
receive
you
nor
hear
your
words
going
forth
from
that
house
or
city
shake
the
dust
from
your
feet
amen
i
say
to
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
that
if
he
will
not
hear
the
church
let
him
be
to
thee
as
the
heathen
and
the
he
that
believeth
shall
be
saved
he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
from
these
passages
we
see
on
the
one
hand
that
the
apostles
and
their
successors
have
received
full
powers
to
announce
the
gospel
and
on
the
other
that
their
hearers
are
obliged
to
listen
with
docility
and
to
obey
not
merely
by
an
external
compliance
but
also
by
an
internal
assent
of
the
intellect
if
therefore
the
catholic
church
could
preach
error
would
not
god
himself
be
responsible
for
the
error
and
could
not
the
faithful
soul
say
to
god
with
all
reverence
and
truth
thou
hast
commanded
me
o
lord
to
hear
thy
church
if
i
am
deceived
by
obeying
her
thou
art
the
cause
of
my
error
but
we
may
rest
assured
that
an
providence
who
commands
his
church
to
speak
in
his
name
will
so
guide
her
in
the
path
of
truth
that
she
shall
never
lead
into
error
those
that
follow
her
teachings
but
as
this
privilege
of
infallibility
was
a
very
extraordinary
favor
our
savior
confers
it
on
the
rulers
of
his
church
in
language
which
removes
all
doubt
from
the
sincere
inquirer
and
under
circumstances
which
add
to
the
majesty
of
his
word
shortly
before
his
death
jesus
consoles
his
disciples
by
this
promise
i
will
ask
the
father
and
he
shall
give
you
another
paraclete
he
may
abide
with
you
but
when
he
the
spirit
of
truth
shall
come
will
teach
you
all
the
following
text
of
the
same
import
forms
the
concluding
words
recorded
of
our
savior
in
matthew
s
gospel
all
power
is
given
to
me
in
heaven
and
on
earth
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
and
behold
i
am
with
you
all
days
even
to
the
consummation
of
the
he
begins
by
asserting
his
own
divine
authority
and
mission
all
power
is
given
etc
that
power
he
then
delegates
to
his
apostles
and
to
their
successors
go
ye
therefore
and
teach
all
nations
etc
he
does
not
instruct
them
to
scatter
bibles
broadcast
over
the
earth
but
to
teach
by
word
of
mouth
and
behold
our
savior
never
arrests
the
attention
of
his
hearers
by
using
the
interjection
unless
when
he
has
something
unusually
solemn
and
extraordinary
to
communicate
an
important
announcement
is
sure
to
follow
this
word
behold
i
am
with
these
words
am
with
are
frequently
addressed
in
sacred
scripture
by
the
almighty
to
his
prophets
and
patriarchs
and
they
always
imply
a
special
presence
and
a
particular
supervision
of
the
deity
they
convey
the
same
meaning
in
the
present
instance
christ
says
equivalently
i
who
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
will
protect
you
from
error
and
will
guide
you
in
your
speech
i
will
be
with
you
not
merely
during
natural
lives
not
for
a
century
only
but
all
days
at
all
times
without
intermission
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
these
words
of
jesus
christ
establish
two
important
facts
promise
to
guard
his
church
from
error
promise
that
his
presence
with
the
church
will
be
continuous
without
any
interval
of
absence
to
the
consummation
of
the
world
and
this
is
also
the
sentiment
of
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
writing
to
the
ephesians
god
gave
some
indeed
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
some
evangelists
and
others
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
building
up
of
the
body
of
christ
until
we
all
meet
in
the
unity
of
faith
that
we
may
no
more
be
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
wickedness
of
men
in
craft
by
which
they
lie
in
wait
to
notwithstanding
these
plain
declarations
of
scripture
some
persons
think
it
an
unwarrantable
assumption
for
the
church
to
claim
infallibility
but
mark
the
consequences
that
follow
from
denying
it
if
your
church
is
not
infallible
it
is
liable
to
err
for
there
is
no
medium
between
infallibility
and
liability
to
error
if
your
church
and
her
ministers
are
fallible
in
their
doctrinal
teachings
as
they
admit
they
may
be
preaching
falsehood
to
you
instead
of
truth
if
so
you
are
in
doubt
whether
you
are
listening
to
truth
or
falsehood
if
you
are
in
doubt
you
can
have
no
faith
for
faith
excludes
doubt
and
in
that
state
you
displease
god
for
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
faith
and
infallibility
must
go
hand
in
hand
the
one
can
not
exist
without
the
other
there
can
be
no
faith
in
the
hearer
unless
there
is
unerring
authority
in
the
authority
founded
upon
such
certain
knowledge
as
precludes
the
possibility
of
falling
into
error
on
his
part
and
including
such
unquestioned
veracity
as
to
prevent
his
deceiving
him
who
accepts
his
word
you
admit
infallible
certainty
in
the
physical
sciences
why
should
you
deny
it
in
the
science
of
salvation
the
astronomer
can
predict
with
accuracy
a
hundred
years
beforehand
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
or
moon
he
can
tell
what
point
in
the
heavens
a
planet
will
reach
on
a
given
day
the
mariner
guided
by
his
compass
knows
amid
the
raging
storm
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
that
he
is
steering
his
course
directly
to
the
city
of
his
destination

is
not

infallible

is
it
not

a
blessing

a
consolation
that
amid
the
views
of
men
amid
the
conflict
of
human
opinion
and
the
tumultuous
waves
of
human
passion
there
is
one
voice
heard
above
the
din
and
uproar
crying
in
clear
unerring
tones
thus
saith
the
lord
it
is
very
strange
that
the
catholic
church
must
apologize
to
the
world
for
simply
declaring
that
she
speaks
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
the
roman
pantheon
was
dedicated
to
all
the
gods
of
the
empire
and
their
name
was
legion
formidable
also
in
numbers
are
the
founders
of
the
religious
sects
existing
in
our
country
a
pantheon
as
vast
as
westminster
abbey
would
hardly
be
spacious
enough
to
contain
statues
for
their
accommodation
if
you
were
to
confront
those
figures
and
to
ask
them
one
by
one
to
give
an
account
of
the
faith
they
had
professed
and
if
they
were
endowed
with
the
gift
of
speech
you
would
find
that
no
two
of
them
were
in
entire
accord
but
that
they
all
differed
among
themselves
on
some
fundamental
principle
of
revelation
would
you
not
be
acting
very
unwisely
and
be
hazarding
your
soul
s
salvation
in
submitting
to
the
teachings
of
so
many
discordant
and
conflicting
oracles
children
of
the
catholic
church
give
thanks
to
god
that
you
are
members
of
that
communion
which
proclaims
year
after
year
the
one
same
and
unalterable
message
of
truth
peace
and
love
and
that
you
are
preserved
from
all
errors
in
faith
and
from
all
illusion
in
the
practice
of
virtue
you
are
happily
strangers
to
those
interior
conflicts
to
those
perplexing
doubts
and
to
that
frightful
uncertainty
which
distracts
the
souls
of
those
whose
private
judgment
is
their
only
guide
who
are
ever
learning
and
never
attaining

the
knowledge
of

you
are

helplessly
over
the
ocean
of
uncertainty
and
carried
about
by
every
wind
of
you
are
not
as
blind
men
led
by
blind
you
are
not
like
those
who
are
in
the
midst
of
a
spiritual
desert
intersected
by
various
not
knowing
which
to
pursue
but
you
are
on
that
high
road
spoken
of
by
the
prophet
isaiah
which
is
so
straight
a
way
that
fools
shall
not
err
you
are
a
part
of
that
universal
communion
which
has
no
high
church
and
low
church
no
new
school
and
old
school
for
you
all
belong
to
that
school
which
is
ever
ancient
and
ever
you
enjoy
that
profound
peace
and
tranquillity
which
springs
from
the
conscious
possession
of
the
whole
truth
well
may
you
exclaim
behold
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
give
thanks
moreover
to
god
that
you
belong
to
a
church
which
has
also
a
keen
sense
to
detect
and
expose
those
moral
shams
those
pious
frauds
those
socialistic
schemes
which
are
so
often
undertaken
in
this
country
ostensibly
in
the
name
of
religion
and
morality
but
which
in
reality
are
subversive
of
morality
and
order
which
are
the
offspring
of
fanaticism
and
serve
as
a
mask
to
hide
the
most
debasing
passions
neither
mormons
nor
millerites
nor
the
advocates
of
free
love
or
of
women
s
rights
so
called
find
any
recruits
in
the
catholic
church
she
will
never
suffer
her
children
to
be
ensnared
by
these
impostures
how
specious
soever
they
may
be
from
what
has
been
said
in
the
preceding
pages
it
follows
that
the
catholic
church
can
not
be
reformed
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
the
pastors
of
the
church
are
personally
impeccable
or
not
subject
to
sin
every
teacher
in
the
church
from
the
pope
down
to
the
humblest
priest
is
liable
at
any
moment
like
any
of
the
faithful
to
fall
from
grace
and
to
stand
in
need
of
moral
reformation
we
all
carry
this
treasure
of
innocence
in
earthen
my
meaning
is
that
the
church
is
not
susceptible
of
being
reformed
in
her
doctrines
the
church
is
the
work
of
an
incarnate
god
like
all
god
s
works
it
is
perfect
it
is
therefore
incapable
of
reform
is
it
not
the
height
of
presumption
for
men
to
attempt
to
improve
upon
the
work
of
god
is
it
not
ridiculous
for
the
luthers
the
calvins
the
knoxes
and
the
henries
and
a
thousand
lesser
lights
to
be
offering
their
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
church
as
if
it
were
a
human
institution
our
lord
himself
has
never
ceased
to
rule
personally
over
his
church
it
is
time
enough
for
little
men
to
take
charge
of
the
ship
when
the
great
captain
abandons
the
helm
a
protestant
gentleman
of
very
liberal
education
remarked
to
me
before
the
opening
of
the
late
ecumenical
council
i
am
assured
sir
by
a
friend
in
confidence
that
at
a
secret
conclave
of
bishops
recently
held
in
rome
it
was
resolved
that
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
would
be
reconsidered
and
abolished
at
the
approaching
general
council
in
fact
that
the
definition
was
a
mistake
and
that
the
blunder
of
would
be
repaired
in
i
told
him
of
course
that
no
such
question
could
be
entertained
in
the
council
that
the
doctrinal
decrees
of
the
church
were
irrevocable
and
that
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
was
defined
once
and
forever
if
only
one
instance
could
be
given
in
which
the
church
ceased
to
teach
a
doctrine
of
faith
which
had
been
previously
held
that
single
instance
would
be
the
death
blow
of
her
claim
to
infallibility
but
it
is
a
marvelous
fact
worthy
of
record
that
in
the
whole
history
of
the
church
from
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
first
no
solitary
example
can
be
adduced
to
show
that
any
pope
or
general
council
ever
revoked
a
decree
of
faith
or
morals
enacted
by
any
preceding
pontiff
or
council
her
record
in
the
past
ought
to
be
a
sufficient
warrant
that
she
will
tolerate
no
doctrinal
variations
in
the
future
if
as
we
have
seen
the
church
has
authority
from
god
to
teach
and
if
she
teaches
nothing
but
the
truth
is
it
not
the
duty
of
all
christians
to
hear
her
voice
and
obey
her
commands
she
is
the
organ
of
the
holy
ghost
she
is
the
representative
of
jesus
christ
who
has
said
to
her
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
she
is
the
mistress
of
truth
it
is
the
property
of
the
human
mind
to
embrace
truth
wherever
it
finds
it
it
would
therefore
be
not
only
an
act
of
irreverence
but
of
sheer
folly
to
disobey
the
voice
of
this
mother
if
a
citizen
is
bound
to
obey
the
laws
of
his
country
though
these
laws
may
not
in
all
respects
be
conformable
to
strict
justice
if
a
child
is
bound
by
natural
and
divine
law
to
obey
his
mother
though
she
may
sometimes
err
in
her
judgments
how
much
more
strictly
are
not
we
obliged
to
be
docile
to
the
teachings
of
the
catholic
church
our
mother
whose
admonitions
are
always
just
whose
precepts
are
immutable
for
twenty
years
observed
a
recently
converted
minister
of
the
protestant
church
i
fought
and
struggled
against
the
church
with
all
the
energy
of
my
will
but
when
i
became
a
catholic
all
my
doubts
ended
my
inquiries
ceased
i
became
as
a
little
child
and
rushed
like
a
lisping
babe
into
the
arms
of
my
by
baptism
christians
become
children
of
the
church
no
matter
who
pours
upon
them
the
regenerating
waters
if
she
is
our
mother
where
is
our
love
and
obedience
when
the
infant
seeks
nourishment
at
its
mother
s
breast
it
does
not
analyze
its
food
when
it
receives
instructions
from
its
mother
s
lips
it
never
doubts
but
instinctively
believes
when
the
mother
stretches
forth
her
hand
the
child
follows
unhesitatingly
the
christian
should
have
for
his
spiritual
mother
all
the
simplicity
all
the
credulity
i
might
say
of
a
child
guided
by
the
instincts
of
faith
unless
ye
become
says
our
lord
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
as
babes
desire
the
rational
milk
without
guile
that
thereby
you
may
grow
unto
in
her
nourishment
there
is
no
poison
in

doctrines
there
is
no

chapter
viii
the
church
and
the
bible
the
church
as
we
have
just
seen
is
the
only
divinely
constituted
teacher
of
revelation
now
the
scripture
is
the
great
depository
of
the
word
of
god
therefore
the
church
is
the
divinely
appointed
custodian
and
interpreter
of
the
bible
for
her
office
of
infallible
guide
were
superfluous
if
each
individual
could
interpret
the
bible
for
himself
that
god
never
intended
the
bible
to
be
the
christian
s
rule
of
faith
independently
of
the
living
authority
of
the
church
will
be
the
subject
of
this
chapter
no
nation
ever
had
a
greater
veneration
for
the
bible
than
the
jewish
people
the
holy
scripture
was
their
pride
and
their
glory
it
was
their
national
song
in
time
of
peace
it
was
their
meditation
and
solace
in
time
of
tribulation
and
exile
and
yet
the
jews
never
dreamed
of
settling
their
religious
controversies
by
a
private
appeal
to
the
word
of
god
whenever
any
religious
dispute
arose
among
the
people
it
was
decided
by
the
high
priest
and
the
sanhedrim
which
was
a
council
consisting
of
civil
and
ecclesiastical
judges
the
sentence
of
the
high
priest
and
of
his
associate
judges
was
to
be
obeyed
under
penalty
of
death
if
thou
perceive
says
the
book
of
deuteronomy
that
there
be
among
you
a
hard
and
doubtful
matter
in
judgment
thou
shalt
come
to
the
priests
of
the
levitical
race
and
to
the
judge
and
they
shall
show
thee
the
truth
of
the
judgment
and
thou
shalt
follow
their
sentence
neither
shalt
thou
decline
to
the
right
hand
nor
to
the
left
but
he
that
will
refuse
to
obey
the
commandment
of
the
priest
that
man
shall
die
and
thou
shalt
take
away
the
evil
from
from
this
clear
sentence
you
perceive
that
god
does
not
refer
the
jews
for
the
settlement
of
their
controversies
to
the
letter
of
the
law
but
to
the
living
authority
of
the
ecclesiastical
tribunal
which
he
had
expressly
established
for
that
purpose
hence
the
priests
were
required
to
be
intimately
acquainted
with
the
sacred
scripture
because
they
were
the
depositaries
of
god
s
law
and
were
its
expounders
to
the
people
the
lips
of
the
priest
shall
keep
knowledge
and
they
the
people
shall
seek
the
law
at
his
mouth
because
he
is
the
angel
or
messenger
of
the
lord
of
and
in
fact
very
few
of
the
children
of
israel
except
the
priests
were
in
possession
of
the
divine
books
the
holy
manuscript
was
rare
and
precious
and
what
provision
did
god
make
that
all
the
people
might
have
an
opportunity
of
hearing
the
scriptures
did
he
command
the
sacred
volume
to
be
multiplied
no
but
he
ordered
the
and
the
to
be
distributed
through
the
different
tribes
that
they
might
always
be
at
hand
to
instruct
the
people
in
the
knowledge
of
the
law
the
jews
were
even
forbidden
to
read
certain
portions
of
the
scripture
till
they
had
reached
the
age
of
thirty
years
does
our
savior
reverse
this
state
of
things
when
he
comes
on
earth
does
he
tell
the
jews
to
be
their
own
guides
in
the
study
of
the
scriptures
by
no
means
but
he
commands
them
to
obey
their
constituted
teachers
no
matter
how
disedifying
might
be
their
private
lives
then
said
jesus
to
the
multitudes
and
to
his
disciples
the
scribes
and
pharisees
sit
upon
the
chair
of
moses
all
things
therefore
whatsoever
they
shall
say
to
you
observe
and
it
is
true
our
lord
said
on
one
occasion
search
the
scriptures
for
you
in
them
to
have
life
everlasting
and
the
same
are
they
that
give
testimony
to
this
passage
is
triumphantly
quoted
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
private
interpretation
but
it
proves
nothing
of
the
kind
many
learned
commentators
ancient
and
modern
express
the
verb
in
the
indicative
mood
ye
search
the
at
all
events
our
savior
speaks
here
only
of
the
old
testament
because
the
new
testament
was
not
yet
written
he
addresses
not
the
multitude
but
the
pharisees
who
were
the
teachers
of
the
law
and
reproaches
them
for
not
admitting
his
divinity
you
have
he
says
the
scriptures
in
your
hands
why
then
do
you
not
recognize
me
as
the
messiah
since
they
give
testimony
that
i
am
the
son
of
god
he
refers
them
to
the
scriptures
for
a
proof
of
his
divinity
not
as
to
a
source
from
which
they
were
to
derive
all
knowledge
in
regard
to
the
truths
of
revelation
besides
he
did
not
rest
the
proof
of
his
divinity
upon
the
testimony
of
scripture
for
he
showed
it
the
testimony
of
john
the
baptist
who
had
said
behold
the
lamb
of
god
behold
him
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
see
also
john
i
the
miracles
which
he
wrought
the
testimony
of
the
father
when
he
said
this
is
my
beloved
son
in
whom
i
am
well
pleased
hear
ye
matt
iii
luke
ix
the
scriptures
of
the
old
testament
as
if
he
were
to
say
if
you
are
unwilling
to
receive
these
three
proofs
though
they
are
most
cogent
at
least
you
can
not
reject
the
testimony
of
the
scriptures
of
which
you
boast
so
finally
in
this
very
passage
our
lord
is
explaining
the
sense
of
holy
writ
therefore
its
true
meaning
is
not
left
to
the
private
interpretation
of
every
chance
reader
it
is
therefore
a
grave
perversion
of
the
sacred
text
to
adduce
these
words
in
vindication
of
private
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
but
when
our
redeemer
abolished
the
old
law
and
established
his
church
did
he
intend
that
his
gospel
should
be
disseminated
by
the
circulation
of
the
bible
or
by
the
living
voice
of
his
disciples
this
is
a
vital
question
i
answer
most
emphatically
that
it
was
by
preaching
alone
that
he
intended
to
convert
the
nations
and
by
preaching
alone
they
were
converted
no
nation
has
ever
yet
been
converted
by
the
agency
of
bible
associations
jesus
himself
never
wrote
a
line
of
scripture
he
never
once
commanded
his
apostles
to
write
a
word
or
even
to
circulate
the
scriptures
already
existing
when
he
sends
them
on
their
apostolic
errand
he
says
go
all
the
gospel
to
every
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
and
we
find
the
apostles
acting
in
strict
accordance
with
these
instructions
of
the
twelve
apostles
the
disciples
and
early
followers
of
our
lord
only
eight
have
left
us
any
of
their
sacred
writings
and
the
gospels
and
epistles
were
addressed
to
particular
persons
or
particular
churches
they
were
written
on
the
occasion
of
some
emergency
just
as
bishops
issue
pastoral
letters
to
correct
abuses
which
may
spring
up
in
the
church
or
to
lay
down
some
rules
of
conduct
for
the
faithful
the
apostles
are
never
reported
to
have
circulated
a
single
volume
of
the
holy
scripture
but
they
going
forth
everywhere
the
lord
with
thus
we
see
that
in
the
old
and
the
new
dispensation
the
people
were
to
be
guided
by
a
living
authority
and
not
by
their
private
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
indeed
until
the
religious
revolution
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
a
thing
unheard
of
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
that
people
should
be
governed
by
the
dead
letter
of
the
law
either
in
civil
or
ecclesiastical
affairs
how
are
your
civil
affairs
regulated
in
this
state
for
instance
certainly
not
in
accordance
with
your
personal
interpretation
of
the
laws
of
virginia
but
in
accordance
with
decisions
which
are
rendered
by
the
constituted
judges
of
the
state
now
what
the
civil
code
is
to
the
citizen
the
scripture
is
to
the
christian
the
word
of
god
as
well
as
the
civil
law
must
have
an
interpreter
by
whose
decision
we
are
obliged
to
abide
we
often
hear
the
shibboleth
the
bible
and
the
bible
only
must
be
your
why
then
do
you
go
to
the
useless
expense
of
building
fine
churches
and
what
is
the
use
of
your
preaching
sermons
and
catechizing
the
young
if
the
bible
at
home
is
a
sufficient
guide
for
your
people
the
fact
is
you
reverend
gentlemen
contradict
in
practice
what
you
so
vehemently
advance
in
theory
do
not
tell
me
that
the
bible
is
or
if
you
believe
it
is
cease
your
instructions
stand
not
between
the
people
and
the
scriptures
i
will
address
myself
now
in
a
friendly
spirit
to
a
and
will
proceed
to
show
him
that
he
can
not
consistently
accept
the
silent
book
of
scripture
as
his
sufficient
guide
a
copy
of
the
sacred
volume
is
handed
to
you
by
your
minister
who
says
take
this
book
you
will
find
it
for
your
but
here
a
serious
difficulty
awaits
you
at
the
very
threshold
of
your
investigations
what
assurance
have
you
that
the
book
he
hands
you
is
the
word
of
god
for
every
part
of
the
bible
is
far
from
possessing
intrinsic
evidences
of
inspiration
it
may
for
ought
you
know
contain
more
than
the
word
of
god
or
it
may
not
contain
all
the
word
of
god
we
must
not
suppose
that
the
bible
was
always
as
it
is
now
a
compact
book
bound
in
a
neat
form
it
was
for
several
centuries
in
scattered
fragments
spread
over
different
parts
of
christendom
meanwhile
many
spurious
books
under
the
name
of
scripture
were
circulated
among
the
faithful
there
was
for
instance
the
spurious
gospel
of
peter
there
was
also
the
gospel
of
james
and
of
matthias
the
catholic
church
in
the
plenitude
of
her
authority
in
the
third
council
of
carthage
separated
the
chaff
from
the
wheat
and
declared
what
books
were
canonical
and
what
were
apocryphal
even
to
this
day
the
christian
sects
do
not
agree
among
themselves
as
to
what
books
are
to
be
accepted
as
genuine
some
christians
of
continental
europe
do
not
recognize
the
gospels
of
mark
and
luke
because
these
evangelists
were
not
among
the
apostles
luther
used
to
call
the
epistle
of
james
a
letter
of
straw
but
even
when
you
are
assured
that
the
bible
contains
the
word
of
god
and
nothing
but
the
word
of
god
how
do
you
know
that
the
translation
is
faithful
the
books
of
scripture
were
originally
written
in
hebrew
and
greek
and
you
have
only
the
translation
before
you
are
certain
that
the
translation
is
faithful
you
must
study
the
hebrew
and
greek
languages
and
then
compare
the
translation
with
the
original
how
few
are
capable
of
this
gigantic
undertaking
indeed
when
you
accept
the
bible
as
the
word
of
god
you
are
obliged
to
receive
it
on
the
authority
of
the
catholic
church
who
was
the
sole
guardian
of
the
scriptures
for
fifteen
hundred
years
but
after
having
ascertained
to
your
satisfaction
that
the
translation
is
faithful
still
the
scriptures
can
never
serve
as
a
complete
rule
of
faith
and
a
complete
guide
to
heaven
independently
of
an
authorized
living
interpreter
a
competent
guide
such
as
our
lord
intended
for
us
must
have
three
characteristics
it
must
be
within
the
reach
of
everyone
it
must
be
clear
and
intelligible
it
must
be
able
to
satisfy
us
on
all
questions
relating
to
faith
and
morals
complete
guide
of
salvation
must
be
within
the
reach
of
every
inquirer
after
truth
for
god
wishes
all
men
to
be
saved
and
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
therefore
he
must
have
placed
within
the
reach
of
everyone
the
means
of
arriving
at
the
truth
now
it
is
clear
that
the
scriptures
could
not
at
any
period
have
been
accessible
to
everyone
they
could
not
have
been
accessible
the
primitive
because
they
were
not
all
written
for
a
long
time
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
the
christian
religion
was
founded
in
the
year
matthew
s
gospel
the
first
part
of
the
new
testament
ever
written
did
not
appear
till
eight
years
after
the
church
was
established
about
twenty
years
when
luke
wrote
his
gospel
and
john
s
gospel
did
not
come
to
light
till
toward
the
end
of
the
first
century
for
many
years
after
the
gospels
and
epistles
were
written
the
knowledge
of
them
was
confined
to
the
churches
to
which
they
were
addressed
it
was
not
till
the
close
of
the
fourth
century
that
the
church
framed
her
canon
of
scripture
and
declared
the
bible
as
we
now
possess
it
to
be
the
genuine
word
of
god
and
this
was
the
golden
age
of
christianity
the
most
perfect
christians
lived
and
died
and
went
to
heaven
before
the
most
important
parts
of
the
scriptures
were
written
and
what
would
have
become
of
them
if
the
bible
alone
had
been
their
guide
the
art
of
printing
was
not
invented
till
the
fifteenth
century
how
utterly
impossible
it
was
to
supply
everyone
with
a
copy
of
the
scriptures
the
fourth
to
the
fifteenth
during
that
long
period
bibles
had
to
be
copied
with
the
pen
there
were
but
a
few
hundred
of
them
in
the
christian
world
and
these
were
in
the
hands
of
the
clergy
and
the
learned
according
to
the
protestant
system
the
art
of
printing
would
have
been
much
more
necessary
to
the
apostles
than
the
gift
of
tongues
it
was
well
for
luther
that
he
did
not
come
into
the
world
until
a
century
after
the
immortal
invention
of
guttenberg
a
hundred
years
earlier
his
idea
of
directing
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
men
to
read
the
bible
would
have
been
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
and
would
inevitably
have
caused
his
removal
from
the
pulpit
of
wittenberg
to
a
hospital
for
the
and
even
the
present
with
all
the
aid
of
steam
printing
presses
with
all
the
bible
associations
extending
through
this
country
and
england
and
supported
at
enormous
expense
it
taxes
all
their
energies
to
supply
every
missionary
country
with
bibles
printed
in
the
languages
of
the
tribes
and
peoples
for
whom
they
are
intended
but
even
if
the
bible
were
at
all
times
accessible
to
everyone
how
many
millions
exist
in
every
age
and
country
not
excepting
our
own
age
of
boasted
enlightenment
who
are
not
accessible
to
the
bible
because
they
are
incapable
of
reading
the
word
of
god
hence
the
doctrine
of
private
interpretation
would
render
many
men
s
salvation
not
only
difficult
but
impossible
competent
religious
guide
must
be
clear
and
intelligible
to
all
so
that
everyone
may
fully
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
instructions
it
contains
is
the
bible
a
book
intelligible
to
all
far
from
it
it
is
full
of
obscurities
and
difficulties
not
only
for
the
illiterate
but
even
for
the
learned
peter
himself
informs
us
that
in
the
epistles
of
paul
there
are
certain
things
hard
to
be
understood
which
the
unlearned
and
the
unstable
wrest
as
they
do
also
the
other
scriptures
to
their
own
and
consequently
he
tells
us
elsewhere
that
no
prophecy
of
scripture
is
made
by
private
we
read
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
that
a
certain
man
was
riding
in
his
chariot
reading
the
book
of
isaiah
and
being
asked
by
philip
whether
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
prophecy
he
replied
how
can
i
understand
unless
some
man
show
me
admitting
by
these
modest
words
that
he
did
not
pretend
of
himself
to
interpret
the
scriptures
the
fathers
of
the
church
though
many
of
them
spent
their
whole
lives
in
the
study
of
the
scriptures
are
unanimous
in
pronouncing
the
bible
a
book
full
of
knotty
difficulties
and
yet
we
find
in
our
days
pedants
with
a
mere
smattering
of
biblical
knowledge
who
see
no
obscurity
at
all
in
the
word
of
god
and
who
presume
to
expound
it
from
genesis
to
revelation
fools
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
does
not
the
conduct
of
the
reformers
conclusively
show
the
utter
folly
of
interpreting
the
scriptures
by
private
judgment
as
soon
as
they
rejected
the
oracle
of
the
church
and
set
up
their
own
private
judgment
as
the
highest
standard
of
authority
they
could
hardly
agree
among
themselves
on
the
meaning
of
a
single
important
text
the
bible
became
in
their
hands
a
complete
babel
the
sons
of
noe
attempted
in
their
pride
to
ascend
to
heaven
by
building
the
tower
of
babel
and
their
scheme
ended
in
the
confusion
and
multiplication
of
tongues
the
children
of
the
reformation
endeavored
in
their
conceit
to
lead
men
to
heaven
by
the
private
interpretation
of
the
bible
and
their
efforts
led
to
the
confusion
and
the
multiplication
of
religions
let
me
give
you
one
example
out
of
a
thousand
these
words
of
the
gospel
this
is
my
body
were
understood
only
in
one
sense
before
the
reformation
the
new
lights
of
the
sixteenth
century
gave
no
fewer
than
eighty
different
meanings
to
these
four
simple
words
and
since
their
time
the
number
of
interpretations
has
increased
to
over
a
hundred
no
one
will
deny
that
in
our
days
there
exists
a
vast
multitude
of
sects
which
are
daily
multiplying
no
one
will
deny
that
this
multiplying
of
creeds
is
a
crying
scandal
and
a
great
in
the
way
of
the
conversion
of
heathen
nations
no
one
can
deny
that
these
divisions
in
the
christian
family
are
traceable
to
the
assumption
of
the
right
of
private
judgment
every
divine
with
a
superficial
education
imagines
that
he
has
received
a
call
from
heaven
to
inaugurate
a
new
religion
and
he
is
ambitious
of
handing
down
his
fame
to
posterity
by
stamping
his
name
on
a
new
sect
and
every
one
of
these
champions
of
modern
creeds
appeals
to
the
unchanging
bible
in
support
of
his
doctrines
thus
one
body
of
christians
will
prove
from
the
bible
that
there
is
but
one
person
in
god
while
the
rest
will
prove
from
the
same
source
that
a
trinity
of
persons
is
a
clear
article
of
divine
revelation
one
will
prove
from
the
holy
book
that
jesus
christ
is
not
god
others
will
appeal
to
the
same
text
to
attest
his
divinity
one
denomination
will
assert
on
the
authority
of
scripture
that
infant
baptism
is
not
necessary
for
salvation
while
others
will
hold
that
it
is
some
christians
with
bible
in
hand
will
teach
that
there
are
no
sacraments
others
will
say
that
there
are
only
two
some
will
declare
that
the
inspired
word
does
not
preach
the
eternity
of
punishments
others
will
say
that
the
bible
distinctly
vindicates
that
dogma
do
not
clergymen
appear
every
day
in
the
pulpit
and
on
the
authority
of
the
book
of
revelation
point
out
to
us
with
painful
accuracy
the
year
and
the
day
on
which
this
world
is
to
come
to
an
end
and
when
their
prophecy
fails
of
execution
they
coolly
put
off
our
destruction
to
another
time
very
recently
several
hundred
mormon
women
presented
a
petition
to
the
government
at
washington
protesting
against
any
interference
with
their
abominable
polygamy
and
they
insist
that
their
cherished
system
is
sustained
by
the
word
of
god
such
is
the
legitimate
fruit
of
private
interpretation
our
civil
government
is
run
not
by
private
judgment
but
by
the
constituted
authorities
no
one
in
his
senses
would
allow
our
laws
to
be
interpreted
and
war
to
be
declared
by
sensational
journals
or
by
any
private
individuals
why
not
apply
the
same
principle
to
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
and
the
government
of
the
church
would
it
not
be
extremely
hazardous
to
make
a
long
voyage
in
a
ship
in
which
the
officers
and
crew
are
fiercely
contending
among
themselves
about
the
manner
of
explaining
the
compass
and
of
steering
their
course
how
much
more
dangerous
is
it
to
trust
to
contending
captains
in
the
journey
to
heaven
nothing
short
of
an
infallible
authority
should
satisfy
you
when
it
is
a
question
of
steering
your
course
to
eternity
on
this
vital
point
there
should
be
no
conflict
of
opinion
among
those
that
guide
you
there
should
be
no
conjecture
but
there
must
be
always
someone
at
the
helm
whose
voice
gives
assurance
amid
the
fiercest
storms
that
is
rule
of
faith
or
a
competent
guide
to
heaven
must
be
able
to
instruct
in
all
the
truths
necessary
for
salvation
now
the
scriptures
alone
do
not
contain
all
the
truths
which
a
christian
is
bound
to
believe
nor
do
they
explicitly
enjoin
all
the
duties
which
he
is
obliged
to
practice
not
to
mention
other
examples
is
not
every
christian
obliged
to
sanctify
sunday
and
to
abstain
on
that
day
from
unnecessary
servile
work
is
not
the
observance
of
this
law
among
the
most
prominent
of
our
sacred
duties
but
you
may
read
the
bible
from
genesis
to
revelation
and
you
will
not
find
a
single
line
authorizing
the
sanctification
of
sunday
the
scriptures
enforce
the
religious
observance
of
saturday
a
day
which
we
never
sanctify
the
catholic
church
correctly
teaches
that
our
lord
and
his
apostles
inculcated
certain
important
duties
of
religion
which
are
not
recorded
by
the
inspired
writers
for
instance
most
christians
pray
to
the
holy
ghost
a
practice
which
is
nowhere
found
in
the
bible
we
must
therefore
conclude
that
the
scriptures
can
not
be
a
sufficient
guide
and
rule
of
faith
because
they
can
not
at
any
time
be
within
the
reach
of
every
inquirer
because
they
are
not
of
themselves
clear
and
intelligible
even
in
matters
of
the
highest
importance
and
because
they
do
not
contain
all
the
truths
necessary
for
salvation
god
forbid
that
any
of
my
readers
should
be
tempted
to
conclude
from
what
i
have
said
that
the
catholic
church
is
opposed
to
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
or
that
she
is
the
enemy
of
the
bible
the
catholic
church
the
enemy
of
the
bible
good
god
what
monstrous
ingratitude
what
base
calumny
is
contained
in
that
assertion
as
well
might
you
accuse
the
virgin
mother
of
trying
to
crush
the
infant
savior
at
her
breast
as
to
accuse
the
church
our
mother
of
attempting
to
crush
out
of
existence
the
word
of
god
as
well
might
you
charge
the
patriotic
statesman
with
attempting
to
destroy
the
constitution
of
his
country
while
he
strove
to
protect
it
from
being
mutilated
by
unprincipled
demagogues
for
fifteen
centuries
the
church
was
the
sole
guardian
and
depository
of
the
bible
and
if
she
really
feared
that
sacred
book
who
was
to
prevent
her
during
that
long
period
from
tearing
it
in
shreds
and
scattering
it
to
the
winds
she
could
have
thrown
it
into
the
sea
as
the
unnatural
mother
would
have
thrown
away
her
and
who
would
have
been
the
wiser
what
has
become
of
those
millions
of
once
famous
books
written
in
past
ages
they
have
nearly
all
perished
but
amid
this
wreck
of
ancient
literature
the
bible
stands
almost
a
solitary
monument
like
the
pyramids
of
egypt
amid
the
surrounding
wastes
that
venerable
volume
has
survived
the
wars
and
revolutions
and
the
barbaric
invasions
of
fifteen
centuries
who
rescued
it
from
destruction
the
catholic
church
without
her
fostering
care
the
new
testament
would
probably
be
as
little
known
today
as
the
book
of
the
days
of
the
kings
of
little
do
we
imagine
in
our
age
of
steam
printing
how
much
labor
it
cost
the
church
to
preserve
and
perpetuate
the
sacred
scriptures
learned
monks
who
are
now
abused
in
their
graves
by
thoughtless
men
were
constantly
employed
in
copying
with
the
pen
the
holy
bible
when
one
monk
died
at
his
post
another
took
his
place
watching
like
a
faithful
sentinel
over
the
treasure
of
god
s
word
let
me
give
you
a
few
plain
facts
to
show
the
pains
which
the
church
has
taken
to
perpetuate
the
scriptures
the
canon
of
the
bible
as
we
have
seen
was
framed
in
the
fourth
century
in
that
same
century
pope
damasus
commanded
a
new
and
complete
translation
of
the
scriptures
to
be
made
into
the
latin
language
which
was
then
the
living
tongue
not
only
of
rome
and
italy
but
of
the
civilized
world
if
the
popes
were
afraid
that
the
bible
should
see
the
light
this
was
a
singular
way
of
manifesting
their
fear
the
task
of
preparing
a
new
edition
of
the
scriptures
was
assigned
to
jerome
the
most
learned
hebrew
scholar
of
his
time
this
new
translation
was
disseminated
throughout
christendom
and
on
that
account
was
called
the
or
popular
edition
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
the
modern
languages
of
europe
began
to
spring
up
like
so
many
shoots
from
the
parent
latin
stock
the
scriptures
also
soon
found
their
way
into
these
languages
the
venerable
bede
who
lived
in
england
in
the
eighth
century
and
whose
name
is
profoundly
reverenced
in
that
country
translated
the
sacred
scriptures
into
saxon
which
was
then
the
language
of
england
he
died
while
dictating
the
last
verses
of
john
s
gospel
thomas
arundel
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
a
funeral
discourse
on
queen
anne
consort
of
richard
pronounced
in
praises
her
for
her
diligence
in
reading
the
four
gospels
the
head
of
the
church
of
england
could
not
condemn
in
others
what
he
commended
in
the
queen
sir
thomas
more
affirms
that
before
the
days
of
wycliffe
there
was
an
english
version
of
the
scriptures
by
good
and
godly
people
with
devotion
and
soberness
well
and
reverently
if
partial
restrictions
began
to
be
placed
on
the
circulation
of
the
bible
in
england
in
the
fifteenth
century
these
restrictions
were
occasioned
by
the
conduct
of
wycliffe
and
his
followers
who
not
only
issued
a
new
translation
on
which
they
engrafted
their
novelties
of
doctrine
but
also
sought
to
explain
the
sacred
text
in
a
sense
foreign
to
the
received
interpretation
of
tradition
while
laboring
to
diffuse
the
word
of
god
it
is
the
duty
as
well
as
the
right
of
the
church
as
the
guardian
of
faith
to
see
that
the
faithful
are
not
misled
by
unsound
editions
printing
was
invented
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
almost
a
hundred
years
later
came
the
reformation
it
is
often
triumphantly
said
and
i
suppose
there
are
some
who
even
at
the
present
day
are
ignorant
enough
to
believe
the
assertion
that
the
first
edition
of
the
bible
ever
published
after
the
invention
of
printing
was
the
edition
of
martin
luther
the
fact
is
that
before
luther
put
his
pen
to
paper
no
fewer
than
editions
of
the
scriptures
had
appeared
on
the
continent
of
europe
not
to
speak
of
those
printed
in
great
britain
of
those
editions
were
published
in
german
one
in
spanish
four
in
french
in
italian
five
in
flemish
and
four
in
bohemian
coming
down
to
our
own
times
if
you
open
an
english
catholic
bible
you
will
find
in
the
preface
a
letter
of
pope
pius
in
which
he
strongly
recommends
the
pious
reading
of
the
holy
scriptures
a
pope
s
letter
is
the
most
weighty
authority
in
the
church
you
will
also
find
in
haydock
s
bible
the
letters
of
the
bishops
of
the
united
states
in
which
they
express
the
hope
that
this
splendid
edition
would
have
a
wide
circulation
among
their
flocks
these
facts
ought
i
think
to
convince
every
candid
mind
that
the
church
far
from
being
opposed
to
the
reading
of
the
scriptures
does
all
she
can
to
encourage
their
perusal
a
gentleman
of
north
carolina
lately
informed
me
that
the
first
time
he
entered
a
catholic
bookstore
he
was
surprised
at
witnessing
on
the
shelves
an
imposing
array
of
bibles
for
sale
up
to
that
moment
he
had
believed
the
unfounded
charge
that
catholics
were
forbidden
to
read
the
scriptures
he
has
since
embraced
the
catholic
faith
and
perhaps
i
may
be
permitted
here
to
record
my
personal
experiences
during
a
long
course
of
study
i
speak
of
myself
not
because
my
case
is
exceptional
but
on
the
contrary
because
my
example
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
system
pursued
toward
ecclesiastical
students
in
all
colleges
throughout
the
catholic
world
in
reference
to
the
holy
scriptures
in
our
course
of
humanities
we
listened
every
day
to
the
reading
of
the
bible
when
we
were
advanced
to
the
higher
branches
of
philosophy
and
theology
the
study
of
the
sacred
scriptures
formed
an
important
part
of
our
education
we
read
besides
every
day
a
chapter
of
the
new
testament
not
standing
or
sitting
but
on
our
knees
and
then
reverently
kissed
the
inspired
page
we
listened
at
our
meals
each
day
to
selections
from
the
bible
and
we
always
carried
about
with
us
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
so
familiar
indeed
were
the
students
with
the
sacred
volume
that
many
of
them
on
listening
to
a
few
verses
could
tell
from
what
portion
of
the
scriptures
you
were
reading
the
only
dread
we
were
taught
to
have
of
the
scriptures
was
that
of
reading
them
without
fear
and
reverence
and
after
his
ordination
every
priest
is
obliged
in
conscience
to
devote
upwards
of
an
hour
each
day
to
the
perusal
of
the
word
of
god
i
am
not
aware
that
clergymen
of
other
denominations
are
bound
by
the
same
duty
what
is
good
for
the
clergy
must
be
good
also
for
the
laity
be
assured
that
if
you
become
a
catholic
you
will
never
be
forbidden
to
read
the
bible
it
is
our
earnest
wish
that
every
word
of
the
gospel
may
be
imprinted
on
your
memory
and
on
your
heart
chapter
ix
the
primacy
of
peter
the
catholic
church
teaches
also
that
our
lord
conferred
on
peter
the
first
place
of
honor
and
jurisdiction
in
the
government
of
his
whole
church
and
that
the
same
spiritual
supremacy
has
always
resided
in
the
popes
or
bishops
of
rome
as
being
the
successors
of
peter
consequently
to
be
true
followers
of
christ
all
christians
both
among
the
clergy
and
the
laity
must
be
in
communion
with
the
see
of
rome
where
peter
rules
in
the
person
of
his
successor
before
coming
to
any
direct
proofs
on
this
subject
i
may
state
that
in
the
old
law
the
high
priest
appointed
by
almighty
god
filled
an
office
analogous
to
that
of
pope
in
the
new
law
in
the
jewish
church
there
were
priests
and
levites
ordained
to
minister
at
the
altar
and
there
was
also
a
supreme
ecclesiastical
tribunal
with
the
high
priest
at
its
head
all
matters
of
religious
controversy
were
referred
to
this
tribunal
and
in
the
last
resort
to
the
high
priest
whose
decision
was
enforced
under
pain
of
death
if
there
be
a
hard
matter
in
judgment
between
blood
and
blood
cause
and
cause
leprosy
and
leprosy
thou
shalt
come
to
the
priests
of
the
levitical
race
and
to
the
judge
and
they
shall
show
thee
true
judgment
and
thou
shalt
do
whatever
they
say
who
preside
in
the
place
which
the
lord
shall
choose
and
thou
shalt
follow
their
sentence
and
thou
shalt
not
decline
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
but
he
that
will
refuse
to
obey
the
commandment
of
the
priest
who
ministereth
at
the
time
that
man
shall
die
and
thou
shalt
take
away
the
evil
from
from
this
passage
it
is
evident
that
in
the
hebrew
church
the
high
priest
had
the
highest
jurisdiction
in
religious
matters
by
this
means
unity
of
faith
and
worship
was
preserved
among
the
people
of
god
now
the
jewish
synagogue
as
paul
testifies
was
the
type
and
figure
of
the
christian
church
for
all
these
things
happened
to
them
the
jews
in
we
must
therefore
find
in
the
church
of
christ
a
spiritual
judge
exercising
the
same
supreme
authority
as
the
high
priest
wielded
in
the
old
law
for
if
a
supreme
pontiff
was
necessary
in
the
mosaic
dispensation
to
maintain
purity
and
uniformity
of
worship
the
same
dignitary
is
equally
necessary
now
to
preserve
unity
of
faith
every
civil
government
has
an
acknowledged
head
the
president
is
the
head
of
the
united
states
government
queen
victoria
is
the
ruler
of
great
britain
the
sultan
sways
the
turkish
empire
if
these
nations
had
no
authorized
leader
to
govern
them
they
would
be
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
mere
mob
and
anarchy
confusion
and
civil
war
would
inevitably
follow
as
recently
happened
to
france
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
iii
even
in
every
family
domestic
peace
requires
that
someone
preside
now
the
church
of
christ
is
a
visible
is
a
society
composed
of
human
beings
she
has
it
is
true
a
spiritual
end
in
view
but
having
to
deal
with
men
she
must
have
a
government
as
well
as
every
other
organized
society
this
government
at
least
in
its
essential
elements
our
lord
must
have
established
for
his
church
for
was
he
not
as
wise
as
human
legislators
and
shall
we
suppose
that
of
all
lawgivers
the
wisdom
incarnate
alone
left
his
kingdom
on
earth
to
be
governed
without
a
head
but
someone
will
tell
me
we
do
not
deny
that
the
church
has
a
head
god
himself
is
its
this
is
evading
the
real
question
is
not
god
the
ruler
of
all
governments
by
me
he
says
kings
reign
and
lawgivers
decree
just
he
is
the
recognized
head
of
our
republic
and
of
every
christian
family
in
the
land
but
nevertheless
there
is
always
presiding
over
the
country
a
visible
chief
who
represents
god
on
earth
in
like
manner
the
church
besides
an
invisible
head
in
heaven
must
have
a
visible
head
on
earth
the
body
and
members
of
the
church
are
visible
why
not
also
the
head
the
church
without
a
supreme
ruler
would
be
like
an
army
without
a
general
a
navy
without
an
admiral
a
without
a
shepherd
or
like
a
human
body
without
a
head
the
christian
communities
separated
from
the
catholic
church
deny
that
peter
received
any
authority
over
the
other
apostles
and
hence
they
reject
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
the
absence
from
the
protestant
communions
of
a
divinely
appointed
visible
head
is
to
them
an
endless
source
of
weakness
and
dissension
it
is
an
insuperable
barrier
against
any
hope
of
a
permanent
reunion
among
themselves
because
they
are
left
without
a
common
rallying
centre
or
basis
of
union
and
are
placed
in
an
unhappy
state
of
schism
the
existence
on
the
contrary
of
a
supreme
judge
of
controversy
in
the
catholic
church
is
the
secret
of
her
admirable
unity
this
is
the
keystone
that
binds
together
and
strengthens
the
imperishable
arch
of
faith
from
the
very
fact
then
of
the
existence
of
a
supreme
head
in
the
jewish
church
from
the
fact
that
a
head
is
always
necessary
for
civil
government
for
families
and
corporations
from
the
fact
especially
that
a
visible
head
is
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
unity
in
the
church
while
the
absence
of
a
head
necessarily
leads
to
anarchy
we
are
forced
to
conclude
even
though
positive
evidence
were
wanting
that
in
the
establishment
of
his
church
it
must
have
entered
into
the
mind
of
the
divine
lawgiver
to
place
over
it
a
primate
invested
with
superior
judicial
powers
but
have
we
any
positive
proof
that
christ
did
appoint
a
supreme
ruler
over
his
church
to
those
indeed
who
read
the
scriptures
with
the
single
eye
of
pure
intention
the
most
abundant
evidence
of
this
fact
is
furnished
to
my
mind
the
new
testament
establishes
no
doctrine
unless
it
satisfies
every
candid
reader
that
our
lord
gave
plenipotentiary
powers
to
peter
to
govern
the
whole
church
in
this
chapter
i
shall
speak
of
the
promise
the
institution
and
the
exercise
of
peter
s
primacy
as
recorded
in
the
new
testament
the
next
chapter
shall
be
devoted
to
its
perpetuity
in
the
popes
of
the
our
saviour
on
a
certain
occasion
asked
his
disciples
saying
whom
do
men
say
that
the
son
of
man
is
and
they
said
some
say
that
thou
art
john
the
baptist
and
others
elias
and
others
jeremiah
or
one
of
the
prophets
jesus
saith
to
them
but
whom
do
ye
say
that
i
am
peter
as
usual
is
the
leader
and
spokesman
simon
peter
answering
said
thou
art
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
and
jesus
answering
said
to
him
blessed
art
thou
simon
because
flesh
and
blood
hath
not
revealed
it
to
thee
but
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
and
i
say
to
thee
that
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
and
i
will
give
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
also
here
we
find
peter
confessing
the
divinity
of
christ
and
in
reward
for
that
confession
he
is
honored
with
the
promise
of
the
primacy
our
savior
by
the
words
thou
art
peter
clearly
alludes
to
the
new
name
which
he
himself
had
conferred
upon
simon
when
he
received
him
into
the
number
of
his
followers
john
i
and
he
now
reveals
the
reason
for
the
change
of
name
which
was
to
insinuate
the
honor
he
was
to
confer
on
him
by
appointing
him
president
of
the
christian
republic
just
as
god
in
the
old
law
changed
abram
s
name
to
abraham
when
he
chose
him
to
be
the
father
of
a
mighty
nation
the
word
in
the
tongue
which
our
savior
spoke
means
the
sentence
runs
thus
in
that
language
art
a
rock
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
indeed
all
respectable
protestant
commentators
have
now
abandoned
and
even
ridicule
the
absurdity
of
applying
the
word
to
anyone
but
to
peter
as
the
sentence
can
bear
no
other
construction
unless
our
lord
s
good
grammar
and
common
sense
are
called
in
question
jesus
our
lord
founded
but
one
church
which
he
was
pleased
to
build
on
peter
therefore
any
church
that
does
not
recognize
peter
as
its
foundation
stone
is
not
the
church
of
christ
and
therefore
can
not
stand
for
it
is
not
the
work
of
god
this
is
plain
would
to
god
that
all
would
see
it
aright
and
with
eyes
free
from
prejudice
he
continues
and
i
will
give
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
etc
in
ancient
times
and
particularly
among
the
hebrew
people
keys
were
an
emblem
of
jurisdiction
to
affirm
that
a
man
had
received
the
keys
of
a
city
was
equivalent
to
the
assertion
that
he
had
been
appointed
its
governor
in
the
book
of
revelation
our
savior
says
that
he
has
the
keys
of
death
and
of
hell
which
means
that
he
is
endowed
with
power
over
death
and
hell
in
fact
even
to
this
day
does
not
the
presentation
of
keys
convey
among
ourselves
the
idea
of
authority
if
the
proprietor
of
a
house
on
leaving
it
for
the
summer
says
to
any
friend
here
are
the
keys
of
my
house
would
not
this
simple
declaration
without
a
word
of
explanation
convey
the
idea
i
give
you
full
control
of
my
house
you
may
admit
or
exclude
whom
you
please
you
represent
me
in
my
absence
let
us
now
apply
this
interpretation
to
our
redeemer
s
words
when
he
says
to
peter
i
will
give
to
thee
the
keys
he
evidently
means
i
will
give
the
supreme
authority
over
my
church
which
is
the
citadel
of
faith
my
earthly
jerusalem
thou
and
thy
successors
shall
be
my
visible
representatives
to
the
end
of
time
and
be
it
remembered
that
to
peter
alone
and
to
no
other
apostle
were
these
solemn
words
addressed
of
the
the
promise
which
our
redeemer
made
of
creating
peter
the
supreme
ruler
of
his
church
is
fulfilled
in
the
following
passage
jesus
saith
to
simon
peter
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
more
than
these
he
saith
to
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
to
him
feed
my
lambs
he
saith
to
him
again
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
he
saith
to
him
yea
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
saith
to
him
feed
my
lambs
he
saith
to
him
the
third
time
simon
son
of
john
lovest
thou
me
peter
was
grieved
because
he
had
said
to
him
the
third
time
lovest
thou
me
and
he
said
to
him
lord
thou
knowest
all
things
thou
knowest
that
i
love
thee
he
said
to
him
feed
my
these
words
were
addressed
by
our
lord
to
peter
after
his
resurrection
the
whole
of
christ
is
confided
to
him
without
any
exception
or
limitation
peter
has
jurisdiction
not
only
over
the
weak
and
tender
portion
of
the
which
are
understood
the
faithful
but
also
over
the
sheep
the
pastors
themselves
who
hold
the
same
relations
to
their
congregations
that
the
sheep
hold
to
the
lambs
because
they
bring
forth
unto
jesus
christ
and
nourish
the
spiritual
lambs
of
the
fold
to
other
pastors
a
certain
portion
of
the
flock
is
assigned
to
peter
the
entire
fold
for
never
did
jesus
say
to
any
other
apostle
or
bishop
what
he
said
to
peter
feed
my
whole
flock
candid
reader
do
you
not
profess
to
be
a
member
of
christ
s
flock
yes
you
answer
do
you
take
your
spiritual
food
from
peter
and
his
successor
and
do
you
hear
the
voice
of
peter
or
have
you
wandered
into
the
fold
of
strangers
who
spurn
peter
s
voice
ponder
well
this
momentous
question
for
if
peter
is
authorized
to
feed
the
lambs
of
christ
s
flock
the
lambs
should
hear
peter
s
voice
of
the
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
which
contain
almost
the
only
scripture
narrative
that
exists
of
the
apostles
subsequent
to
our
lord
s
ascension
peter
appears
before
us
like
saul
among
the
tribes
standing
head
and
shoulders
over
his
brethren
by
the
prominent
part
he
takes
in
every
ministerial
duty
the
first
twelve
chapters
of
the
acts
are
devoted
to
peter
and
to
some
of
the
other
apostles
the
remaining
chapters
being
chiefly
occupied
with
the
labors
of
the
apostles
of
the
gentiles
in
that
brief
historical
fragment
as
well
as
in
the
gospels
the
name
of
peter
is
everywhere
peter
s
name
always
stands
first
in
the
list
of
the
apostles
while
judas
iscariot
is
invariably
mentioned
last
peter
is
even
called
by
matthew
first
now
peter
was
first
neither
in
age
nor
in
priority
of
election
his
elder
brother
andrew
having
been
chosen
before
him
the
meaning
therefore
of
the
expression
must
be
that
peter
was
first
not
only
in
rank
and
honor
but
also
in
authority
peter
is
the
first
apostle
who
performed
a
miracle
he
is
the
first
to
address
the
jews
in
jerusalem
while
his
apostolic
brethren
stand
respectfully
around
him
upon
which
occasion
he
converts
three
thousand
souls
peter
is
the
first
to
make
converts
from
the
gentile
world
in
the
persons
of
cornelius
and
his
friends
when
there
is
question
of
electing
a
successor
to
judas
peter
he
points
out
to
the
apostles
and
disciples
the
duty
of
choosing
another
to
succeed
the
traitor
the
apostles
silently
acquiesce
in
the
instructions
of
their
leader
in
the
apostolic
council
of
jerusalem
peter
is
the
first
whose
sentiments
are
recorded
before
his
discourse
there
was
much
but
when
he
had
ceased
to
speak
all
the
multitude
held
their
james
and
the
other
apostles
concur
in
the
sentiments
of
peter
without
a
single
dissenting
voice
james
is
cast
into
prison
by
herod
and
afterward
beheaded
he
was
one
of
the
three
most
favored
apostles
he
was
the
cousin
of
our
lord
and
brother
of
john
he
was
most
dear
to
the
faithful
yet
no
extraordinary
efforts
are
made
by
the
faithful
to
rescue
him
from
death
peter
is
imprisoned
about
the
same
time
the
whole
church
is
aroused
prayers
for
his
deliverance
ascend
to
heaven
not
only
from
jerusalem
but
also
from
every
christian
family
in
the
land
the
army
of
the
lord
can
afford
to
lose
a
chieftain
in
the
person
of
james
but
it
can
not
yet
spare
the
the
enemies
of
the
church
had
hoped
that
the
destruction
of
the
chief
shepherd
would
involve
the
dispersion
of
the
whole
flock
therefore
they
redoubled
their
fury
against
the
prince
of
the
apostles
just
as
her
modern
enemies
concentrate
their
shafts
against
the
pope
his
successor
does
not
this
incident
eloquently
proclaim
peter
s
superior
authority
in
fact
peter
figures
so
conspicuously
in
every
page
that
his
primacy
is
not
only
admissible
but
is
forced
on
the
judgment
of
the
impartial
reader
what
are
the
principal
objections
advanced
against
the
primacy
of
peter
they
are
chiefly
i
may
say
exclusively
confined
to
the
three
following
our
lord
rebuked
peter
paul
criticised
his
conduct
on
a
point
not
affecting
doctrine
but
discipline
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
blames
peter
because
he
withdrew
for
a
time
from
the
society
of
the
gentile
converts
for
fear
of
scandalizing
the
jews
the
supremacy
of
peter
conflicts
with
the
supreme
dominion
of
christ
for
my
part
i
can
not
see
how
these
objections
can
invalidate
the
claims
of
peter
was
not
jesus
peter
s
superior
may
not
a
superior
rebuke
his
servant
without
infringing
on
the
servant
s
prerogatives
and
why
could
not
paul
censure
the
conduct
of
peter
without
questioning
that
superior
s
authority
it
is
not
a
very
uncommon
thing
for
ecclesiastics
occupying
an
inferior
position
in
the
church
to
admonish
even
the
pope
bernard
though
only
a
monk
wrote
a
work
in
which
with
apostolic
freedom
he
administers
counsel
to
pope
eugenius
and
cautions
him
against
the
dangers
to
which
his
eminent
position
exposes
him
yet
no
man
had
more
reverence
for
any
pope
than
bernard
had
for
this
great
pontiff
can
not
our
governor
animadvert
upon
the
president
s
conduct
without
impairing
the
president
s
jurisdiction
nay
from
this
very
circumstance
i
draw
a
confirming
evidence
of
peter
s
supremacy
paul
mentions
it
as
a
fact
worthy
of
record
that
he
actually
peter
to
his
do
you
think
it
would
be
worth
recording
if
paul
had
rebuked
james
or
john
or
barnabas
by
no
means
if
one
brother
rebukes
another
the
matter
excites
no
special
attention
but
if
a
son
rebukes
his
father
or
if
a
priest
rebukes
his
bishop
to
his
face
we
understand
why
he
would
consider
it
a
fact
worth
relating
hence
when
paul
goes
to
the
trouble
of
telling
us
that
he
took
exception
to
peter
s
conduct
he
mentions
it
as
an
extraordinary
exercise
of
apostolic
freedom
and
leaves
on
our
mind
the
obvious
inference
that
peter
was
his
superior
in
the
very
same
epistle
to
the
galatians
paul
plainly
insinuates
peter
s
superior
rank
i
went
he
says
to
jerusalem
to
see
peter
and
i
tarried
with
him
fifteen
saints
chrysostom
and
ambrose
tell
us
that
this
was
not
an
idle
visit
of
ceremony
but
that
the
object
of
paul
in
making
the
journey
was
to
testify
his
respect
and
honor
for
the
chief
of
the
apostles
jerome
observes
in
a
humorous
vein
that
paul
went
not
to
behold
peter
s
eyes
his
cheeks
or
his
countenance
whether
he
was
thin
or
stout
with
nose
straight
or
twisted
covered
with
hair
or
bald
not
to
observe
the
outward
man
to
show
honor
to
the
first
there
are
others
who
pretend
in
spite
of
our
lord
s
declaration
to
the
contrary
that
loyalty
to
peter
is
disloyalty
to
christ
and
that
by
acknowledging
peter
as
the
rock
on
which
the
church
is
built
we
set
our
savior
aside
so
far
from
this
being
the
case
we
acknowledge
jesus
christ
as
the
chief
cornerstone
as
well
as
the
divine
architect
of
the
building
the
true
test
of
loyalty
to
jesus
is
not
only
to
worship
him
but
to
venerate
even
the
representatives
whom
he
has
chosen
will
anyone
pretend
to
say
that
my
obedience
to
the
governor
s
appointee
is
a
mark
of
disrespect
to
the
governor
himself
i
think
our
state
executive
would
have
little
faith
in
the
allegiance
of
any
citizen
who
would
say
to
him
governor
i
honor
you
personally
but
your
official
s
order
i
shall
peter
is
called
the
first
bishop
of
rome
because
he
transferred
his
see
from
antioch
to
rome
where
he
suffered
martyrdom
with
paul
we
are
not
surprised
that
modern
skepticism
which
rejects
the
divinity
of
christ
and
denies
even
the
existence
of
god
should
call
in
question
the
fact
that
peter
lived
and
died
in
rome
the
reason
commonly
alleged
for
disputing
this
event
is
that
the
acts
of
the
apostles
make
no
mention
of
peter
s
labors
and
martyrdom
in
rome
for
the
same
reason
we
might
deny
that
paul
was
beheaded
in
rome
that
john
died
in
ephesus
and
that
andrew
was
crucified
the
scripture
is
silent
regarding
these
historical
records
and
yet
they
are
denied
by
no
one
the
intrinsic
evidence
of
peter
s
first
epistle
the
testimony
of
his
immediate
successors
in
the
ministry
as
well
as
the
avowal
of
eminent
protestant
commentators
all
concur
in
fixing
the
see
of
peter
in
rome
babylon
from
which
peter
addresses
his
first
epistle
is
understood
by
learned
annotators
protestant
and
catholic
to
refer
to
word
babylon
being
symbolical
of
the
corruption
then
prevailing
in
the
city
of
the
cæsars
clement
the
fourth
bishop
of
rome
who
is
mentioned
in
terms
of
praise
by
paul
ignatius
bishop
of
antioch
who
died
in
irenæus
origen
jerome
eusebius
the
great
historian
and
other
eminent
writers
testify
to
peter
s
residence
in
rome
while
no
ancient
ecclesiastical
writer
has
ever
contradicted
the
statement
john
calvin
a
witness
above
suspicion
cave
an
able
anglican
critic
grotius
and
other
distinguished
protestant
writers
do
not
hesitate
to
the
unanimous
voice
of
catholic
tradition
indeed
no
historical
fact
will
escape
the
shafts
of
incredulity
if
peter
s
residence
and
glorious
martyrdom
in
rome
are
called
in
question
chapter
x
the
supremacy
of
the
popes
the
church
did
not
die
with
peter
it
was
destined
to
continue
till
the
end
of
time
consequently
whatever
official
prerogatives
were
conferred
on
peter
were
not
to
cease
at
his
death
but
were
to
be
handed
down
to
his
successors
from
generation
to
generation
the
church
is
in
all
ages
as
much
in
need
of
a
supreme
ruler
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
apostles
nay
more
as
the
church
is
now
more
widely
diffused
than
it
was
then
and
is
ruled
by
frailer
men
it
is
more
than
ever
in
need
of
a
central
power
to
preserve
its
unity
of
faith
and
uniformity
of
discipline
whatever
privileges
therefore
were
conferred
on
peter
which
may
be
considered
essential
to
the
government
of
the
church
are
inherited
by
the
bishops
of
rome
as
successors
of
the
prince
of
the
apostles
just
as
the
constitutional
powers
given
to
george
washington
have
devolved
on
the
present
incumbent
of
the
presidential
chair
peter
it
is
true
besides
the
prerogatives
inherent
in
his
office
possessed
also
the
gift
of
inspiration
and
the
power
of
working
miracles
these
two
latter
gifts
are
not
claimed
by
the
pope
as
they
were
personal
to
peter
and
by
no
means
essential
to
the
government
of
the
church
god
acts
toward
his
church
as
we
deal
with
a
tender
sapling
when
we
first
plant
it
we
water
it
and
soften
the
clay
about
its
roots
but
when
it
takes
deep
root
we
leave
it
to
the
care
of
nature
s
laws
in
like
manner
when
christ
first
planted
his
church
he
nourished
its
infancy
by
miraculous
agency
but
when
it
grew
to
be
a
tree
of
fair
proportions
he
left
it
to
be
governed
by
the
general
laws
of
his
providence
from
what
i
have
said
you
can
easily
infer
that
the
arguments
in
favor
of
peter
s
primacy
have
equal
weight
in
demonstrating
the
supremacy
of
the
popes
as
the
present
question
however
is
a
subject
of
vast
importance
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
from
incontestable
historical
evidence
that
the
popes
have
always
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
continued
to
exercise
supreme
jurisdiction
not
only
in
the
western
church
till
the
reformation
but
also
throughout
the
eastern
church
till
the
great
schism
of
the
ninth
century
the
question
of
an
appeal
is
never
made
from
a
superior
to
an
inferior
court
nor
even
from
one
court
to
another
of
jurisdiction
we
do
not
appeal
from
washington
to
richmond
but
from
richmond
to
washington
now
if
we
find
the
see
of
rome
from
the
foundation
of
christianity
entertaining
and
deciding
cases
of
appeal
from
the
oriental
churches
if
we
find
that
her
decision
was
final
and
irrevocable
we
must
conclude
that
the
supremacy
of
rome
over
all
the
churches
is
an
undeniable
fact
let
me
give
you
a
few
illustrations
to
begin
with
pope
clement
who
was
the
third
successor
of
peter
and
who
is
laudably
mentioned
by
paul
in
one
of
his
epistles
some
dissension
and
scandal
having
occurred
in
the
church
of
corinth
the
matter
is
brought
to
the
notice
of
pope
clement
he
at
once
exercises
his
supreme
authority
by
writing
letters
of
remonstrance
and
admonition
to
the
corinthians
and
so
great
was
the
reverence
entertained
for
these
epistles
by
the
faithful
of
corinth
that
for
a
century
later
it
was
customary
to
have
them
publicly
read
in
their
churches
why
did
the
corinthians
appeal
to
rome
far
away
in
the
west
and
not
to
ephesus
so
near
home
in
the
east
where
the
apostle
john
still
lived
evidently
because
the
jurisdiction
of
ephesus
was
local
while
that
of
rome
was
universal
about
the
year
the
question
regarding
the
proper
day
for
celebrating
easter
was
agitated
in
the
east
and
referred
to
pope
victor
i
the
eastern
church
generally
celebrated
easter
on
the
day
on
which
the
jews
kept
the
passover
while
in
the
west
it
was
observed
then
as
it
is
now
on
the
first
sunday
after
the
full
moon
of
the
vernal
equinox
victor
directs
the
eastern
churches
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
to
conform
to
the
practice
of
the
west
and
his
instructions
are
universally
followed
cyprian
bishop
of
carthage
was
martyred
in
from
his
appeals
to
pope
cornelius
and
to
pope
stephen
especially
on
the
subject
of
baptism
from
his
writings
and
correspondence
as
well
as
from
the
whole
tenor
of
his
administration
it
is
quite
evident
that
cyprian
as
well
as
the
african
episcopate
upheld
the
supremacy
of
the
bishop
of
rome
dionysius
bishop
of
rome
about
the
middle
of
the
third
century
having
heard
that
the
patriarch
of
alexandria

on
some
points
of
faith

an
explanation
of
the
suspected
prelate
who
in
obedience
to
his
superior
promptly
vindicates
his
own
orthodoxy
athanasius
the
great
patriarch
of
alexandria
appeals
in
the
fourth
century
to
pope
julius

an
unjust
decision
rendered

emphasized
from

circumstance

not
an
arrogant

and
became

author
of
the
greek

here
are
a
few
examples
taken
at
random
from
church
history
we
see
prelates
most
eminent
for
their
sanctity
and
learning
occupying
the
highest
position
in
the
eastern
church
and
consequently
far
removed
from
the
local
influences
of
rome
appealing
in
every
period
of
the
early
church
from
the
decisions
of
their
own
bishops
and
their
councils
to
the
supreme
arbitration
of
the
holy
see
if
this
does
not
constitute
superior
jurisdiction
i
have
yet
to
learn
what
superior
authority
means
of
every
denomination
admit
the
orthodoxy
of
of
the
first
five
centuries
of
the
church
no
one
has
ever
called
in
question
the
faith
of
such
men
as
basil
chrysostom
cyprian
augustine
jerome
ambrose
and
leo
they
were
the
acknowledged
guardians
of
pure
doctrine
and
the
living
representatives
of
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
they
were
to
the
church
in
their
generation
what
peter
and
paul
and
james
were
to
the
church
in
its
infancy
we
instinctively
consult
them
about
the
faith
of
those
times
for
to
whom
shall
we
go
for
the
words
of
eternal
life
if
not
to
them
now
the
fathers
of
the
church
with
one
voice
pay
homage
to
the
bishops
of
rome
as
their
superiors
the
limited
space
i
have
allowed
myself
in
this
little
volume
will
not
permit
me
to
give
any
extracts
from
their
writings
the
reader
who
may
be
unacquainted
with
the
original
language
of
the
fathers
or
who
has
not
their
writings
at
hand
is
referred
to
a
work
entitled
faith
of
catholics
where
he
will
find
in
an
english
translation
copious
extracts
from
their
writings
vindicating
the
primacy
of
the
popes
afford
another
eloquent
vindication
of
papal
supremacy
an
ecumenical
or
general
council
is
an
assemblage
of
prelates
representing
the
whole
catholic
church
a
general
council
is
to
the
church
what
the
executive
and
legislative
bodies
in
washington
are
to
the
united
states
up
to
the
present
time
nineteen
ecumenical
councils
have
been
convened
including
the
council
of
the
vatican
the
last
eleven
were
held
in
the
west
and
the
first
eight
in
the
east
i
shall
pass
over
the
western
councils
as
no
one
denies
that
they
were
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
pope
i
shall
speak
briefly
of
the
important
influence
which
the
holy
see
exercised
in
the
eight
oriental
councils
the
first
general
council
was
held
in
nicæa
in
the
second
in
constantinople
the
third
in
ephesus
in
the
fourth
in
chalcedon
in
the
fifth
in
constantinople
in
the
sixth
in
the
same
city
in
the
seventh
in
nicæa
in
and
the
eighth
in
constantinople
in
the
bishops
of
rome
convoked
these
assemblages
or
at
least
consented
to
their
convocation
they
presided
by
their
legates
over
all
of
them
except
the
first
and
second
councils
of
constantinople
and
they
confirmed
all
these
eight
by
their
authority
before
becoming
a
law
the
acts
of
the
councils
required
the
pope
s
signature
just
as
our
congressional
proceedings
require
the
president
s
signature
before
they
acquire
the
force
of
law
is
not
this
a
striking
illustration
of
the
primacy
the
pope
convenes
rules
and
sanctions
the
synods
not
by
courtesy
but
by
right
a
dignitary
who
calls
an
assembly
together
who
presides
over
its
deliberations
whose
signature
is
essential
for
confirming
its
acts
has
surely
a
higher
authority
than
the
other
members
shall
refer
to
one
more
historical
point
in
support
of
the
pope
s
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
church
it
is
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
nation
hitherto
converted
from
paganism
to
christianity
since
the
days
of
the
apostles
has
received
the
light
of
faith
from
missionaries
who
were
either
especially
commissioned
by
the
see
of
rome
or
sent
by
bishops
in
open
communion
with
that
this
historical
fact
admits
of
no
exception
let
me
particularize
ireland
s
apostle
is
patrick
who
commissioned
him
pope
celestine
in
the
fifth
century
palladius
is
the
apostle
of
scotland
who
sent
him
the
same
pontiff
celestine
the
received
the
faith
from
augustine
a
benedictine
monk
as
all
historians
catholic
and
testify
who
empowered
augustine
to
preach
pope
gregory
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
remigius
established
the
faith
in
france
at
the
close
of
the
fifth
century
he
was
in
active
communion
with
the
see
of
peter
flanders
received
the
gospel
in
the
seventh
century
from
eligius
who
acknowledged
the
supremacy
of
the
reigning
pope
germany
and
bavaria
venerate
as
their
apostle
boniface
who
is
popularly
known
in
his
native
england
by
his
baptismal
name
of
winfrid
he
was
commissioned
by
pope
gregory
in
the
beginning
of
the
eighth
century
and
was
consecrated
bishop
by
the
same
pontiff
in
the
ninth
century
two
saintly
brothers
cyril
and
methodius
evangelized
russia
sclavonia
moravia
and
other
parts
of
northern
europe
they
recognized
the
supreme
authority
of
pope
nicholas
and
of
his
successors
adrian
ii
and
john
viii
in
the
eleventh
century
norway
was
converted
by
missionaries
introduced
from
england
by
the
norwegian
king
olave
the
conversion
of
sweden
was
consummated
in
the
same
century
by
the
british
apostles
saints
ulfrid
and
eskill
both
of
these
nations
immediately
after
their
conversion
commenced
to
pay
romescot
or
a
small
annual
tribute
to
the
holy
clear
evidence
that
they
were
in
communion
with
the
chair
of
peter
all
the
other
nations
of
europe
having
been
converted
before
the
reformation
received
likewise
the
light
of
faith
from
roman
catholic
missionaries
because
europe
then
recognized
only
one
christian
chief
passing
from
europe
to
asia
and
america
it
is
undeniable
that
francis
xavier
and
the
other
evangelists
who
in
the
sixteenth
century
extended
the
kingdom
of
jesus
christ
through
india
and
japan
were
in
communion
with
the
holy
see
and
that
those
apostles
who
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
converted
the
aboriginal
tribes
of
south
america
and
mexico
received
their
commission
from
the
chair
of
peter
but
you
will
say
the
people
of
the
united
states
profess
to
be
a
christian
nation
do
you
also
claim
them
most
certainly
for
even
those
american
christians
who
are
unhappily
severed
from
the
catholic
church
are
primarily
indebted
for
their
knowledge
of
the
gospel
to
missionaries
in
communion
with
the
holy
see
the
white
races
of
north
america
are
descended
from
england
ireland
scotland
and
the
nations
of
continental
europe
those
european
nations
having
been
converted
by
missionaries
in
subjection
to
the
holy
see
it
follows
that
from
whatever
part
of
europe
you
are
descended
whatever
may
be
your
particular
creed
you
are
indebted
to
the
church
of
rome
for
your
knowledge
of
christianity
do
not
these
facts
demonstrate
the
primacy
of
the
pope
the
apostles
of
europe
and
of
other
countries
received
their
authority
from
rome
is
not
the
power
that
sends
an
ambassador
greater
than
he
who
is
sent
thus
we
see
that
the
name
of
the
pope
is
indelibly
marked
on
every
page
of
ecclesiastical
history
the
sovereign
pontiff
ever
stands
before
us
as
in
the
grand
army
of
the
church
do
the
bishops
of
the
east
feel
themselves
aggrieved
at
home
by
their
patriarchs
or
civil
rulers
they
look
for
redress
to
rome
as
to
the
star
of
their
hope
are
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
early
church
consulted
with
one
voice
they
all
pay
homage
to
the
bishop
of
rome
as
to
their
spiritual
prince
is
an
ecumenical
council
to
be
convened
in
the
east
or
west
the
pope
is
its
leading
spirit
are
new
nations
to
be
converted
to
the
faith
there
is
the
holy
father
clothing
the
missionaries
with
authority
and
giving
his
blessing
to
the
work
are
new
errors
to
be
condemned
in
any
part
of
the
globe
all
eyes
turn
toward
the
oracle
of
rome
to
await
his
anathema
and
his
solemn
judgment
reverberates
throughout
the
length
and
breath
of
the
christian
world
you
might
as
well
shut
out
the
light
of
day
and
the
air
of
heaven
from
your
daily
walks
as
exclude
the
pope
from
his
legitimate
sphere
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
the
history
of
the
united
states
with
the
presidents
left
out
would
be
more
intelligible
than
the
history
of
the
church
to
the
exclusion
of
the
vicar
of
christ
how
i
ask
could
such
authority
endure
so
long
if
it
were
a
usurpation
but
you
will
tell
me
the
supremacy
of
the
pope
has
been
disputed
in
many
so
has
the
authority
of
god
been
called
in
his
very
existence
has
been
denied
for
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
does
this
denial
destroy
the
existence
and
dominion
of
god
has
not
parental
authority
been
impugned
from
the
beginning
but
by
whom
by
unruly
children
was
david
no
longer
king
because
absalom
said
so
it
is
thus
also
with
the
popes
their
parental
sway
has
been
opposed
only
by
their
undutiful
sons
who
grew
impatient
of
the
gospel
yoke
photius
the
leader
of
the
greek
schism
was
an
obedient
son
of
the
pope
until
nicholas
refused
to
recognize
his
usurped
authority
henry
viii
was
a
stout
defender
of
the
pope
s
supremacy
until
clement
vii
refused
to
legalize
his
adultery
luther
professed
a
most
abject
submission
to
the
pope
till
leo
condemned
him
you
can
not
my
dear
reader
be
a
loyal
citizen
of
the
united
states
while
you
deny
the
constitutional
authority
of
the
president
you
have
seen
that
the
bishop
of
rome
is
appointed
not
by
man
but
by
jesus
christ
president
of
the
christian
commonwealth
you
can
not
therefore
be
a
true
citizen
of
the
republic
of
the
church
so
long
as
you
spurn
the
legitimate
supremacy
of
its
divinely
constituted
chief
he
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
says
our
lord
and
he
that
gathereth
not
with
me
how
can
you
be
with
christ
if
you
are
against
his
vicar
the
great
evil
of
our
times
is
the
unhappy
division
existing
among
the
professors
of
christianity
and
from
thousands
of
hearts
a
yearning
cry
goes
forth
for
unity
of
faith
and
union
of
churches
it
was
no
doubt
with
this
laudable
view
that
the
evangelical
alliance
assembled
in
new
york
in
the
fall
of
the
representatives
of
the
different
religious
communions
hoped
to
effect
a
reunion
but
they
signally
and
lamentably
failed
indeed
the
only
result
which
followed
from
the
alliance
was
the
creation
of
a
new
sect
under
the
auspices
of
cummins
that
reverend
gentleman
with
the
characteristic
modesty
of
all
religious
reformers
was
determined
to
have
a
hand
in
improving
the
work
of
jesus
christ
and
like
the
other
reformers
he
said
with
those
who
built
the
tower
of
babel
let
us
make
our
name
famous
before
our
dust
is
scattered
to
the
wind
the
alliance
failed
because
its
members
had
no
common
platform
to
stand
on
there
was
no
voice
in
that
assembly
that
could
say
with
authority
thus
saith
the
i
heartily
join
in
this
prayer
for
christian
unity
and
gladly
would
surrender
my
life
for
such
a
consummation
but
i
tell
you
that
jesus
christ
has
pointed
out
the
only
means
by
which
this
unity
can
be
maintained
viz
the
recognition
of
peter
and
his
successors
as
the
head
of
the
church
build
upon
this
foundation
and
you
will
not
erect
a
tower
of
babel
nor
build
upon
sand
if
all
christian
sects
were
united
with
the
centre
of
unity
then
the
scattered
hosts
of
christendom
would
form
an
army
which
atheism
and
infidelity
could
not
long
withstand
then
indeed
all
could
exclaim
with
balaam
how
beautiful
are
thy
tabernacles
o
jacob
and
thy
tents
o
israel
let
us
pray
that
the
day
may
be
hastened
when
religious
dissensions
will
cease
when
all
christians
will
advance
with
united
front
under
one
common
leader
to
plant
the
cross
in
every
region
and
win
new
kingdoms
to
jesus
christ
chapter
xi
infallibility
of
the
popes
as
the
doctrine
of
papal
infallibility
is
strangely
misapprehended
by
our
separated
brethren
because
it
is
grievously
misrepresented
by
those
who
profess
to
be
enlightened
ministers
of
the
gospel
i
shall
begin
by
stating
what
infallibility
does
not
mean
and
shall
then
explain
what
it
really
is
infallibility
of
the
popes
does
not
signify
that
they
are
inspired
the
apostles
were
endowed
with
the
gift
of
inspiration
and
we
accept
their
writings
as
the
revealed
word
of
god
no
catholic
on
the
contrary
claims
that
the
pope
is
inspired
or
endowed
with
divine
revelation
properly
so
called
for
the
holy
spirit
was
not
promised
to
the
successors
of
peter
in
order
that
they
might
spread
abroad
new
doctrine
which
he
reveals
but
that
under
his
assistance
they
might
guard
inviolably
and
with
fidelity
explain
the
revelation
or
deposit
of
faith
handed
down
by
the
does
not
mean
that
the
pope
is
impeccable
or
specially
exempt
from
liability
to
sin
the
popes
have
been
indeed
with
few
exceptions
men
of
virtuous
lives
many
of
them
are
honored
as
martyrs
out
of
the
two
hundred
and
that
sat
on
the
chair
of
peter
are
invoked
upon
our
altars
as
saints
eminent
for
their
holiness
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
church
charge
only
five
or
six
popes
with
immorality
thus
even
admitting
the
truth
of
the
accusations
brought
against
them
we
have
virtuous
to
one
bad
pope
while
there
was
a
judas
iscariot
among
the
twelve
apostles
but
although
a
vast
majority
of
the
sovereign
pontiffs
should
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
lead
vicious
lives
this
circumstance
would
not
of
itself
impair
the
validity
of
their
prerogatives
which
are
given
not
for
the
preservation
of
their
morals
but
for
the
guidance
of
their
judgment
for
there
was
a
balaam
among
the
prophets
and
a
caiphas
among
the
high
priests
of
the
old
law
the
present
illustrious
pontiff
is
a
man
of
no
ordinary
sanctity
he
has
already
filled
the
highest
position
in
the
church
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
a
spectacle
to
the
world
to
angels
and
to
men
and
no
man
can
point
out
a
stain
upon
his
moral
character
and
yet
pius
like
his
predecessors
confesses
his
sins
every
week
each
morning
at
the
beginning
of
mass
he
says
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
i
confess
to
almighty
god
and
to
his
saints
that
i
have
sinned
exceedingly
in
thought
word
and
and
at
the
offertory
of
the
mass
he
says
receive
o
holy
father
almighty
everlasting
god
this
oblation
which
i
thy
unworthy
servant
offer
for
my
innumerable
sins
offences
and
with
these
facts
before
their
eyes
i
can
not
comprehend
how
ministers
of
the
gospel
betray
so
much
ignorance
or
are
guilty
of
so
much
malice
as
to
proclaim
from
their
pulpits
which
ought
to
be
consecrated
to
truth
that
infallibility
means
exemption
from
sin
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
benefit
their
cause
by
so
flagrant
perversions
of
truth
in
mind
also
that
this
divine
assistance
is
guaranteed
to
the
pope
not
in
his
capacity
as
private
teacher
but
only
in
his
official
capacity
when
he
judges
of
faith
and
morals
as
head
of
the
church
if
a
pope
for
instance
like
benedict
xiv
were
to
write
a
treatise
on
canon
law
his
book
would
be
as
much
open
to
criticism
as
that
of
any
doctor
of
the
church
the
inerrability
of
the
popes
being
restricted
to
questions
of
faith
and
morals
does
not
extend
to
the
natural
sciences
such
as
astronomy
or
geology
unless
where
error
is
presented
under
the
false
name
of
science
and
arrays
itself
against
revealed
truth
it
does
not
therefore
concern
itself
about
the
nature
and
motions
of
the
planets
nor
does
it
regard
purely
political
questions
such
as
the
form
of
government
a
nation
ought
to
adopt
or
for
what
candidates
we
ought
to
vote
the
pope
s
infallibility
therefore
does
not
in
any
way
trespass
on
civil
authority
for
the
pope
s
jurisdiction
belongs
to
spiritual
matters
while
the
duty
of
the
state
is
to
provide
for
the
temporal
welfare
of
its
subjects
what
then
is
the
real
doctrine
of
infallibility
it
simply
means
that
the
pope
as
successor
of
peter
prince
of
the
apostles
by
virtue
of
the
promises
of
jesus
christ
is
preserved
from
error
of
judgment
when
he
promulgates
to
the
church
a
decision
on
faith
or
morals
the
pope
therefore
be
it
known
is
not
the
maker
of
the
divine
law
he
is
only
its
expounder
he
is
not
the
author
of
revelation
but
only
its
interpreter
all
revelation
came
from
god
alone
through
his
inspired
ministers
and
it
was
complete
in
the
beginning
of
the
church
the
holy
father
has
no
more
authority
than
you
or
i
to
break
one
iota
of
the
scripture
and
he
is
equally
with
us
the
servant
of
the
divine
law
in
a
word
the
sovereign
pontiff
is
to
the
church
though
in
a
more
eminent
degree
what
the
supreme
court
is
to
the
united
states
we
have
an
instrument
called
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
is
the
charter
of
our
civil
rights
and
liberties
if
a
controversy
arise
regarding
a
constitutional
clause
the
question
is
referred
in
the
last
resort
to
the
supreme
court
at
washington
the
chief
justice
with
his
associate
judges
examines
into
the
case
and
then
pronounces
judgment
upon
it
and
this
decision
is
final
irrevocable
and
practically
infallible
if
there
were
no
such
court
to
settle
constitutional
questions
the
constitution
itself
would
soon
become
a
dead
letter
every
litigant
would
conscientiously
decide
the
dispute
in
his
own
favor
and
anarchy
separation
and
civil
war
would
soon
follow
but
by
means
of
this
supreme
court
disputes
are
ended
and
the
political
union
of
the
states
is
perpetuated
there
would
have
been
no
civil
war
in
had
our
domestic
quarrel
been
submitted
to
the
legitimate
action
of
our
highest
court
of
judicature
instead
of
being
left
to
the
arbitrament
of
the
sword
the
revealed
word
of
god
is
the
constitution
of
the
church
this
is
the
of
our
christian
liberties
the
pope
is
the
official
guardian
of
our
religious
constitution
as
the
chief
justice
is
the
guardian
of
our
civil
constitution
when
a
dispute
arises
in
the
church
regarding
the
sense
of
scripture
the
subject
is
referred
to
the
pope
for
final
adjudication
the
sovereign
pontiff
before
deciding
the
case
gathers
around
him
his
venerable
colleagues
the
cardinals
of
the
church
or
he
calls
a
council
of
his
associate
judges
of
faith
the
bishops
of
christendom
or
he
has
recourse
to
other
lights
which
the
holy
ghost
may
suggest
to
him
then
after
mature
and
prayerful
deliberation
he
pronounces
judgment
and
his
sentence
is
final
irrevocable
and
infallible
if
the
catholic
church
were
not
fortified
by
this
supreme
tribunal
she
would
be
broken
up
like
the
sects
around
her
into
a
thousand
fragments
and
religious
anarchy
would
soon
follow
but
by
means
of
this
infallible
court
her
marvellous
unity
is
preserved
throughout
the
world
this
doctrine
is
the
keystone
in
the
arch
of
catholic
faith
and
far
from
arousing
opposition
it
ought
to
command
the
unqualified
admiration
of
every
reflecting
mind
these
explanations
being
premised
let
us
now
briefly
consider
the
grounds
of
the
doctrine
itself
the
following
passages
of
the
gospel
spoken
at
different
times
were
addressed
exclusively
to
peter
thou
art
peter
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
i
the
supreme
architect
of
the
universe
says
our
savior
will
establish
a
church
which
is
to
last
till
the
end
of
time
i
will
lay
the
foundation
of
this
church
so
deep
and
strong
on
the
rock
of
truth
that
the
winds
and
storms
of
error
shall
not
prevail
against
it
thou
o
peter
shalt
be
the
foundation
of
this
church
it
shall
never
fall
because
thou
shalt
never
be
shaken
and
thou
shalt
never
be
shaken
because
thou
shalt
rest
on
me
the
rock
of
the
church
of
which
peter
is
the
foundation
is
declared
to
be
is
proof
against
error
how
can
you
suppose
an
immovable
edifice
built
on
a
tottering
foundation
for
it
is
not
the
building
that
sustains
the
foundation
but
it
is
the
foundation
that
supports
the
building
and
i
will
give
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
thou
shalt
hold
the
keys
of
truth
with
which
to
open
to
the
faithful
the
treasures
of
heavenly
science
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
the
judgment
which
thou
shalt
pronounce
on
earth
i
will
ratify
in
heaven
surely
the
god
of
truth
is
incapable
of
sanctioning
an
untruthful
judgment
behold
satan
hath
desired
to
have
you
my
apostles
that
he
may
sift
as
wheat
but
i
have
prayed
for
peter
that
thy
faith
fail
not
and
thou
being
once
converted
confirm
thy
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
jesus
prays
only
for
peter
and
why
for
peter
in
particular
because
on
his
shoulders
was
to
rest
the
burden
of
the
church
our
lord
prays
for
two
things
the
faith
of
peter
and
of
his
successors
might
not
fail
peter
would
confirm
his
brethren
in
the
faith
in
order
as
leo
says
that
the
strength
given
by
christ
to
peter
should
descend
on
the
we
know
that
the
prayer
of
jesus
is
always
heard
therefore
the
faith
of
peter
will
always
be
firm
he
was
destined
to
be
the
oracle
which
all
were
to
consult
hence
we
always
find
him
the
prominent
figure
among
the
apostles
the
first
to
speak
the
first
to
act
on
every
occasion
he
was
to
be
the
guiding
star
that
was
to
lead
the
rest
of
the
faithful
in
the
path
of
truth
he
was
to
be
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
what
the
sun
is
in
the
planetary
centre
around
which
all
would
revolve
and
is
it
not
a
beautiful
spectacle
in
harmony
with
our
ideas
of
god
s
providence
to
behold
in
his
church
a
counterpart
of
the
starry
system
above
us
there
every
planet
moves
in
obedience
to
a
uniform
law
all
are
regulated
by
one
great
luminary
so
in
the
spiritual
order
we
see
every
member
of
the
church
governed
by
one
law
controlled
by
one
voice
and
that
voice
subject
to
god
feed
my
lambs
feed
my
peter
is
appointed
by
our
lord
the
universal
shepherd
of
his
the
sheep
and
of
the
is
shepherd
of
the
bishops
and
priests
as
well
as
of
the
people
the
bishops
are
shepherds
in
reference
to
their
flocks
they
are
sheep
in
reference
to
the
pope
who
is
the
shepherd
of
shepherds
the
pope
as
shepherd
must
feed
the
flock
not
with
the
poison
of
error
but
with
the
healthy
food
of
sound
doctrine
for
he
is
not
a
shepherd
but
a
hireling
who
administers
pernicious
food
to
his
flock
among
the
general
councils
of
the
church
already
held
i
shall
mention
only
three
as
the
acts
of
these
councils
are
amply
sufficient
to
vindicate
the
unerring
character
of
the
see
of
rome
and
the
roman
pontiffs
i
wish
also
to
call
your
attention
to
three
facts
none
of
these
councils
were
held
in
rome
one
of
them
assembled
in
the
east
viz
in
constantinople
and
in
every
one
of
them
the
oriental
and
the
western
bishops
met
for
the
purpose
of
reunion
the
eighth
general
council
held
in
constantinople
in
contains
the
following
solemn
profession
of
faith
salvation
primarily
depends
upon
guarding
the
rule
of
right
faith
and
since
we
can
not
pass
over
the
words
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
who
says
thou
art
peter
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
what
was
said
is
confirmed
by
facts
because
in
the
apostolic
see
the
catholic
religion
has
always
been
preserved
immaculate
and
holy
doctrine
has
been
proclaimed
not
wishing
then
to
be
separated
from
this
faith
and
doctrine
we
hope
to
merit
to
be
in
the
one
communion
which
the
apostolic
see
preaches
in
which
see
is
the
full
and
true
solidity
of
the
christian
this
council
clearly
declares
that
has
always
preserved
and
preached
in
the
roman
but
how
could
this
be
said
of
her
if
the
roman
see
ever
fell
into
error
and
how
could
that
see
be
preserved
from
error
if
the
roman
pontiffs
presiding
over
it
ever
erred
in
faith
in
the
second
general
council
of
lyons
the
greek
bishops
made
the
following
profession
of
faith
the
holy
roman
church
possesses
full
primacy
and
principality
over
the
universal
catholic
church
which
primacy
with
the
plenitude
of
power
she
truly
and
humbly
acknowledges
to
have
received
from
our
lord
himself
in
the
person
of
blessed
peter
prince
or
head
of
the
apostles
whose
successor
the
roman
pontiff
is
and
as
the
roman
see
above
all
others
is
bound
to
defend
the
truth
of
faith
so
also
any
questions
on
faith
arise
they
ought
to
be
defined
by
her
here
the
council
of
lyons
avows
that
the
roman
pontiffs
have
the
power
to
determine
definitely
and
without
appeal
any
questions
of
faith
which
may
arise
in
the
church
in
other
words
the
council
acknowledges
them
to
be
the
supreme
and
infallible
arbiters
of
faith
we
define
says
the
council
of
florence
at
which
also
were
present
the
bishops
of
the
greek
and
the
latin
church
we
define
that
the
roman
pontiff
is
the
successor
of
the
blessed
peter
prince
of
the
apostles
and
true
vicar
of
christ
the
of
the
whole
church
the
father
and
doctor
of
all
christians
and
we
declare
that
to
him
in
the
person
of
blessed
peter
was
given
by
jesus
christ
our
savior
full
power
to
feed
rule
and
govern
the
universal
the
pope
is
here
called
the
or
representative
of
christ
in
this
lower
kingdom
of
his
church
is
the
pope
is
the
organ
of
our
savior
and
speaks
his
sentiments
in
faith
and
morals
but
if
the
pope
erred
in
faith
and
morals
he
would
no
longer
be
christ
s
vicar
and
true
representative
our
minister
in
england
for
instance
would
not
truly
represent
our
government
if
he
was
not
the
organ
of
its
sentiments
the
roman
pontiff
is
called
the
of
the
whole
is
the
visible
head
now
the
church
which
is
the
body
of
christ
is
infallible
it
is
as
paul
says
without
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
such
but
how
can
you
suppose
an
infallible
body
with
a
fallible
head
how
can
an
erring
head
conduct
a
body
in
the
unerring
ways
of
truth
and
justice
he
is
declared
by
the
same
council
to
be
the
and
of
all
christians
how
can
you
expect
an
unerring
family
under
an
erring
father
the
pope
is
called
the
universal
teacher
or
doctor
teacher
of
what
of
truth
not
of
error
error
is
to
the
mind
what
poison
is
to
the
body
you
do
not
call
poison
food
neither
can
you
call
error
doctrine
the
pope
as
universal
teacher
must
always
give
to
the
faithful
not
the
poisonous
food
of
error
but
the
sound
aliment
of
pure
doctrine
in
fine
the
pope
is
also
styled
the
of
the
church
it
was
not
without
a
mysterious
significance
that
our
lord
entered
peter
s
bark
instead
of
that
of
any
of
the
other
apostles
this
bark
our
lord
has
pledged
himself
shall
never
sink
nor
depart
from
her
true
course
how
can
you
imagine
a
stormproof
bark
under
the
charge
of
a
fallible
pilot
but
did
not
the
vatican
council
in
promulgating
the
definition
of
papal
infallibility
in
create
a
new
doctrine
of
revelation
and
did
not
the
church
thereby
forfeit
her
glorious
distinction
of
being
always
unchangeable
in
her
teaching
the
council
did
not
create
a
new
creed
but
rather
confirmed
the
old
one
it
formulated
into
an
article
of
faith
a
truth
which
in
every
age
had
been
accepted
by
the
catholic
world
because
it
had
been
implicitly
contained
in
the
deposit
of
revelation
i
may
illustrate
this
point
by
referring
again
to
our
supreme
court
when
the
chief
justice
with
his
colleagues
decides
a
constitutional
question
his
decision
though
presented
in
a
new
shape
can
not
be
called
a
new
doctrine
because
it
is
based
on
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
constitution
in
like
manner
when
the
church
issues
a
new
dogma
of
faith
that
decree
is
nothing
more
than
a
new
form
of
expressing
an
old
doctrine
because
the
decision
must
be
drawn
from
the
revealed
word
of
god
the
course
pursued
by
the
church
regarding
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
was
practiced
by
her
in
reference
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
our
savior
was
acknowledged
to
be
god
from
the
beginning
of
the
church
yet
his
divinity
was
not
formally
defined
till
the
council
of
nicæa
in
the
fourth
century
and
it
would
not
have
been
defined
even
then
had
it
not
been
denied
by
arius
and
who
will
have
the
presumption
to
say
that
the
belief
in
the
divinity
of
our
lord
had
its
origin
in
the
fourth
century
the
following
has
always
been
the
practice
prevailing
in
the
church
of
god
from
the
beginning
of
her
history
whenever
bishops
or
national
councils
promulgated
doctrines
or
condemned
errors
they
always
transmitted
their
decrees
to
rome
for
confirmation
or
rejection
what
rome
approved
the
universal
church
approved
what
rome
condemned
the
church
condemned
thus
in
the
third
century
pope
stephen
reverses
the
decision
of
cyprian
of
carthage
and
of
a
council
of
african
bishops
regarding
a
question
of
baptism
pope
innocent
in
the
fifth
century
condemns
the
pelagian
heresy
in
reference
to
which
augustine
wrote
this
memorable
sentence
the
acts
of
two
councils
were
sent
to
the
apostolic
see
whence
an
answer
was
returned
the
is
would
to
god
that
the
error
also
had
in
the
fourteenth
century
gregory
xi
condemns
the
heresy
of
wycliffe
pope
leo
in
the
sixteenth
anathematizes
luther
innocent
in
the
seventeenth
at
the
solicitation
of
the
french
episcopate
condemns
the
subtle
errors
of
the
jansenists
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
pius
ix
promulgates
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
here
we
find
the
popes
in
various
ages
condemning
heresies
and
proclaiming
doctrines
of
faith
and
they
could
not
in
a
stronger
manner
assert
their
infallibility
than
by
so
defining
doctrines
of
faith
and
condemning
errors
we
also
behold
the
church
of
christendom
ever
saying
amen
to
the
decisions
of
the
bishops
of
rome
hence
it
is
evident
that
in
every
age
the
church
recognized
the
popes
as
infallible
teachers
every
independent
government
must
have
a
supreme
tribunal
regularly
sitting
to
interpret
its
laws
and
to
decide
cases
of
controversy
likely
to
arise
thus
we
have
in
washington
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
now
the
catholic
church
is
a
complete
and
independent
organization
as
complete
in
its
spiritual
sphere
as
the
united
states
government
is
in
the
temporal
order
the
church
has
its
own
laws
its
own
autonomy
and
government
the
church
therefore
like
civil
powers
must
have
a
permanent
and
stationary
supreme
tribunal
to
interpret
its
laws
and
to
determine
cases
of
religious
controversy
what
constitutes
this
permanent
supreme
court
of
the
church
does
it
consist
of
the
bishops
assembled
in
general
council
no
because
this
is
not
an
ordinary
but
an
extraordinary
tribunal
which
meets
on
an
average
only
once
in
a
hundred
years
is
it
composed
of
the
bishops
scattered
throughout
the
world
by
no
means
because
it
would
be
impracticable
to
consult
all
the
bishops
of
christendom
upon
every
issue
that
might
arise
in
the
church
the
poison
of
error
would
easily
spread
through
the
body
of
the
church
before
a
decision
could
be
rendered
by
the
prelates
dispersed
throughout
the
globe
the
pope
then
as
head
of
the
catholic
church
constitutes
with
just
reason
this
supreme
tribunal
and
as
the
office
of
the
church
is
to
guide
men
into
all
truth
and
to
preserve
them
from
all
error
it
follows
that
he
who
is
appointed
to
watch
over
the
constitution
of
the
church
must
be
infallible
or
exempt
from
error
in
his
official
capacity
as
judge
of
faith
and
morals
the
prerogatives
of
the
pope
must
be
commensurate
with
the
nature
of
the
constitution
which
he
has
to
uphold
the
constitution
is
divine
and
must
have
a
divinely
protected
interpreter
but
you
will
tell
me
that
infallibility
is
too
great
a
prerogative
to
be
conferred
on
man
i
answer
has
not
god
in
former
times
clothed
his
apostles
with
powers
far
more
exalted
they
were
endowed
with
the
gifts
of
working
miracles
of
prophecy
and
inspiration
they
were
the
communicating
god
s
revelation
of
which
the
popes
are
merely
the
custodians
if
god
could
make
man
the
organ
of
his
revealed
word
is
it
impossible
for
him
to
make
man
its
infallible
guardian
and
interpreter
for
surely
greater
is
the
apostle
who
gives
us
the
inspired
word
than
the
pope
who
preserves
it
from
error
if
indeed
our
saviour
had
visibly
remained
among
us
no
interpreter
would
be
needed
since
he
would
explain
his
gospel
to
us
but
as
he
withdrew
his
visible
presence
from
us
it
was
eminently
reasonable
that
he
should
designate
someone
to
expound
for
us
the
meaning
of
his
word
a
protestant
bishop
in
the
course
of
a
sermon
against
papal
infallibility
recently
used
the
following
language
for
my
part
i
have
an
infallible
bible
and
this
is
the
only
infallibility
that
i
this
assertion
though
plausible
at
first
sight
can
not
for
a
moment
stand
the
test
of
sound
criticism
let
us
see
sir
whether
an
infallible
bible
is
sufficient
for
you
either
you
are
infallibly
certain
that
your
interpretation
of
the
bible
is
correct
or
you
are
not
if
you
are
infallibly
certain
then
you
assert
for
yourself
and
of
course
for
every
reader
of
the
scripture
a
personal
infallibility
which
you
deny
to
the
pope
and
which
we
claim
only
for
him
you
make
every
man
his
own
pope
if
you
are
not
infallibly
certain
that
you
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
whole
this
is
a
privilege
you
do
not
i
ask
of
what
use
to
you
is
the
objective
infallibility
of
the
bible
without
an
infallible
interpreter
if
god
as
you
assert
has
left
no
infallible
interpreter
of
his
word
do
you
not
virtually
accuse
him
of
acting
unreasonably
for
would
it
not
be
most
unreasonable
in
him
to
have
revealed
his
truth
to
man
without
leaving
him
a
means
of
ascertaining
its
precise
import
do
you
not
reduce
god
s
word
to
a
bundle
of
contradictions
like
the
leaves
of
the
sybil
which
gave
forth
answers
suited
to
the
wishes
of
every
inquirer
of
the
hundred
and
more
christian
sects
now
existing
in
this
country
does
not
each
take
the
bible
as
its
standard
of
authority
and
does
not
each
member
draw
from
it
a
meaning
different
from
that
of
his
neighbor
now
in
the
mind
of
god
the
scriptures
can
have
but
one
meaning
is
not
this
variety
of
interpretations
the
bitter
fruit
of
your
principle
an
infallible
bible
is
enough
for
me
and
does
it
not
proclaim
the
absolute
necessity
of
some
authorized
and
unerring
interpreter
you
tell
me
to
drink
of
the
water
of
life
but
of
what
use
is
this
water
to
my
parched
lips
since
you
acknowledge
that
it
may
be
poisoned
in
passing
through
the
medium
of
your
interpretation
how
satisfactory
on
the
contrary
and
how
reasonable
is
the
catholic
teaching
on
this
subject
according
to
that
system
christ
says
to
every
christian
here
my
child
is
the
word
of
god
and
with
it
i
leave
you
an
infallible
interpreter
who
will
expound
for
you
its
hidden
meaning
and
make
clear
all
its
difficulties
here
are
the
waters
of
eternal
life
but
i
have
created
a
channel
that
will
communicate
these
waters
to
you
in
all
their
sweetness
without
sediment
of
error
here
is
the
written
constitution
of
my
church
but
i
have
appointed
over
it
a
supreme
tribunal
in
the
person
of
one
to
whom
i
have
given
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
who
will
preserve
that
constitution
inviolate
and
will
not
permit
it
to
be
torn
into
shreds
by
the
conflicting
opinions
of
men
and
thus
my
children
will
be
one
as
i
and
the
father
are
one
chapter
xii
temporal
power
of
the
popes
i
how
the
popes
acquired
temporal
power
for
the
clearer
understanding
of
the
origin
and
the
gradual
growth
of
the
temporal
power
of
the
popes
we
may
divide
the
history
of
the
church
into
three
great
epochs
the
first
embraces
the
period
which
elapsed
from
the
establishment
of
the
church
to
the
days
of
constantine
the
great
in
the
fourth
century
the
second
from
constantine
to
charlemagne
who
was
crowned
emperor
in
the
year
the
third
from
charlemagne
to
the
present
time
when
peter
the
first
pope
in
the
long
unbroken
line
of
sovereign
pontiffs
entered
italy
and
rome
he
did
not
possess
a
foot
of
ground
which
he
could
call
his
own
he
could
say
with
his
divine
master
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
whereon
to
lay
his
the
apostle
died
as
he
had
lived
a
poor
man
having
nothing
at
his
death
save
the
affections
of
a
grateful
people
but
although
the
prince
of
the
apostles
owned
nothing
that
he
could
call
his
personal
property
he
received
from
the
faithful
large
donations
to
be
distributed
among
the
needy
for
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
we
are
told
that
neither
was
anyone
among
them
the
faithful
needy
for
as
many
as
were
owners
of
lands
or
houses
sold
them
and
brought
the
prices
of
the
things
which
they
sold
and
laid
them
before
the
feet
of
the
apostles
and
distribution
was
made
to
everyone
according
as
he
had
such
was
the
filial
attachment
of
the
early
christians
towards
the
pontiffs
of
the
church
such
was
the
confidence
reposed
in
their
personal
integrity
and
in
their
discretion
in
dispensing
the
charity
of
the
faithful
during
the
first
three
hundred
years
the
pastors
of
the
church
were
generally
incapable
of
holding
real
estate
in
rome
for
christianity
was
yet
a
proscribed
religion
and
the
faithful
were
exposed
to
the
most
violent
and
unrelenting
persecutions
that
have
ever
darkened
the
annals
of
history
the
christians
of
rome
worshiped
for
the
most
part
in
the
catacombs
these
catacombs
are
subterranean
chambers
and
passages
under
the
city
of
rome
they
extend
for
miles
in
different
directions
and
are
visited
to
this
day
by
thousands
of
strangers
here
the
primitive
christians
prayed
together
here
they
encouraged
one
another
to
martyrdom
here
they
died
and
were
buried
so
that
these
caverns
served
at
the
same
time
as
temples
of
worship
for
the
living
and
as
tombs
for
the
dead
at
last
constantine
the
great
brought
peace
to
the
church
the
long
night
of
pagan
persecution
was
succeeded
by
the
bright
dawn
of
religious
liberty
and
as
our
blessed
savior
rose
triumphant
from
the
grave
after
having
lain
there
for
three
days
so
did
our
early
brethren
in
the
faith
emerge
from
the
tombs
of
the
catacombs
after
having
been
buried
as
it
were
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
for
three
centuries
constantine
gave
to
the
roman
church
munificent
donations
of
money
and
real
estate
which
were
augmented
by
additional
grants
contributed
by
subsequent
emperors
hence
the
patrimony
of
the
roman
pontiffs
soon
became
very
considerable
voltaire
himself
tells
us
that
the
wealth
which
the
popes
acquired
was
spent
not
in
satisfying
their
own
avarice
and
ambition
but
in
the
most
laudable
works
of
charity
and
religion
they
expended
their
patrimony
he
says
in
sending
missionaries
to
evangelize
pagan
europe
in
giving
hospitality
to
exiled
bishops
at
rome
and
in
feeding
the
poor
and
i
may
here
add
that
succeeding
popes
have
generously
imitated
the
munificence
of
the
early
pontiffs
an
event
occurred
in
the
reign
of
constantine
which
paved
the
way
for
the
partial
jurisdiction
which
the
roman
pontiffs
commenced
to
enjoy
over
rome
and
which
they
continued
to
exercise
till
they
obtained
full
sovereignty
in
the
days
of
king
pepin
of
france
in
the
year
the
emperor
constantine
transferred
the
seat
of
empire
from
rome
to
constantinople
the
present
capital
of
turkey
the
city
was
named
after
constantine
who
founded
it
a
subsequent
emperor
appointed
a
governor
or
exarch
to
rule
italy
who
resided
in
the
city
of
ravenna
this
new
system
as
is
manifest
did
not
work
well
the
emperor
of
constantinople
referred
all
matters
to
his
deputy
in
ravenna
and
the
deputy
was
more
anxious
to
conciliate
the
emperor
than
to
satisfy
the
people
of
rome
italy
and
rome
were
then
in
a
political
condition
analogous
to
that
in
which
the
irish
were
placed
for
several
centuries
abandoned
to
itself
rome
became
a
tempting
prey
to
those
numerous
hordes
of
barbarians
from
the
north
that
then
devastated
italy
the
city
was
successively
attacked
by
the
goths
under
alaric
and
by
the
vandals
under
genseric
and
was
threatened
by
the
huns
under
attila
unable
to
obtain
assistance
from
the
emperor
in
the
east
or
the
governor
at
ravenna
the
citizens
of
rome
looked
up
to
the
popes
as
their
only
governors
and
protectors
and
their
only
salvation
in
the
dangers
which
threatened
them
the
confidence
which
they
reposed
in
the
pontiffs
was
not
misplaced
the
popes
were
not
only
devoted
spiritual
fathers
but
firm
and
valiant
civil
governors
when
attila
who
was
surnamed
the
scourge
of
god
approached
the
city
with
an
army
of
men
pope
leo
the
great
went
out
to
meet
him
unattended
by
troops
his
mild
eloquence
disarmed
the
indomitable
chieftain
and
induced
him
to
retrace
his
steps
thus
he
saved
the
city
from
pillage
and
the
people
from
destruction
the
same
pope
leo
also
confronted
genseric
the
leader
of
the
vandals
and
although
he
could
not
this
time
protect
rome
from
the
plunder
of
the
soldiers
he
saved
the
lives
of
the
citizens
from
slaughter
such
acts
as
these
were
naturally
calculated
to
bind
the
roman
people
more
strongly
to
the
popes
and
to
alienate
them
from
their
nominal
rulers
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighth
century
leo
isauricus
one
of
the
successors
of
constantine
on
the
imperial
throne
not
content
with
his
civil
authority
endeavored
like
henry
to
usurp
spiritual
jurisdiction
and
like
the
same
english
monarch
sought
to
rob
the
people
of
their
sacred
traditions
a
civil
ruler
dabbling
in
religion
is
as
reprehensible
as
a
clergyman
dabbling
in
politics
both
render
themselves
odious
as
well
as
ridiculous
the
emperor
commanded
all
paintings
of
our
savior
and
his
saints
to
be
removed
from
the
churches
on
the
assumption
that
such
an
exhibition
was
an
act
of
idolatry
pope
gregory
ii
wrote
to
the
emperor
an
energetic
remonstrance
reminding
him
that
dogmas
of
faith
are
to
be
interpreted
by
the
pontiffs
of
the
church
and
not
by
emperors
and
begging
him
to
spare
the
sacred
paintings
but
the
pope
s
remonstrance
and
entreaties
were
in
vain
this
conduct
of
the
emperor
tended
to
widen
still
more
the
breach
between
himself
and
the
roman
people
soon
after
an
event
occurred
which
abolished
forever
the
authority
of
the
byzantine
emperors
in
italy
and
established
on
a
sure
and
lasting
basis
the
temporal
sovereignty
of
the
popes
in
astolphus
king
of
the
lombards
invaded
italy
captured
some
italian
cities
and
threatened
to
advance
on
rome
pope
stephen
who
then
ruled
the
church
sent
an
urgent
appeal
to
the
emperor
constantine
copronymus
successor
of
leo
the
isaurian
imploring
him
to
come
to
the
relief
of
rome
and
his
italian
provinces
the
emperor
manifested
his
usual
apathy
and
indifference
and
received
the
message
with
coldness
and
neglect
in
this
emergency
stephen
who
sees
that
no
time
is
to
be
lost
crosses
the
alps
in
person
approaches
pepin
king
of
france
and
begs
that
powerful
monarch
to
protect
the
italian
people
who
were
utterly
abandoned
by
those
that
ought
to
be
their
defenders
the
pious
king
after
paying
his
homage
to
the
pope
sets
out
for
italy
with
his
army
defeats
the
invading
lombards
and
places
the
pope
at
the
head
of
the
conquered
provinces
charlemagne
the
successor
of
pepin
not
only
confirms
the
grant
of
his
father
but
increases
the
temporal
domain
of
the
pope
by
donating
him
some
additional
provinces
this
small
piece
of
territory
the
roman
pontiffs
continued
to
govern
from
that
time
till
with
the
exception
of
brief
intervals
of
foreign
usurpation
and
certainly
if
ever
any
prince
merited
the
appellation
of
legitimate
sovereign
that
title
is
eminently
deserved
by
the
bishops
of
rome
ii
the
validity
and
justice
of
their
title
there
are
three
titles
which
render
the
tenure
of
a
prince
honest
and
incontestable
possession
legitimate
and
just
use
of
the
original
grant
confided
to
the
bishop
of
rome
possessed
his
temporality
by
all
these
titles
temporal
dominion
of
the
pope
is
most
ancient
in
point
of
time
he
commenced
as
we
have
seen
to
enjoy
full
sovereignty
about
the
middle
of
the
eighth
century
the
pope
was
consequently
a
temporal
ruler
for
upwards
of
years
the
papal
dynasty
is
therefore
the
oldest
in
europe
and
probably
in
the
world
the
pope
was
the
temporal
ruler
of
rome
four
hundred
years
before
england
subjugated
ireland
and
seven
hundred
before
the
first
european
pressed
his
foot
on
the
american
continent
civil
authority
was
established
not
by
the
sword
of
conquest
nor
the
violence
of
usurpation
he
did
not
mount
the
throne
upon
the
ruins
of
outraged
liberties
or
violated
treaties
but
he
was
called
to
rule
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
a
grateful
people
always
the
devoted
spiritual
father
of
rome
he
providentially
became
its
civil
defender
and
the
temporal
power
he
had
possessed
already
by
popular
suffrage
was
ratified
and
sanctioned
by
the
sovereign
act
of
the
frankish
monarch
in
a
word
the
ship
of
state
was
in
danger
of
being
engulfed
beneath
the
fierce
waves
of
foreign
invasion
the
captain
meantime
folded
his
arms
and
abandoned
the
ship
to
her
fate
the
pope
was
called
to
the
helm
in
the
emergency
and
he
saved
the
vessel
from
shipwreck
and
the
people
from
destruction
hence
even
gibbon
the
english
historian
who
can
not
be
suspected
of
partiality
has
the
candor
to
use
the
following
language
in
discussing
this
subject
their
the
pope
s
temporal
dominion
is
now
confirmed
by
the
reverence
of
a
thousand
years
and
their
noblest
title
is
the
free
choice
of
a
people
whom
they
had
redeemed
from
is
the
use
or
advantage
of
the
temporal
power
this
is
well
worth
considering
as
many
have
erroneous
notions
on
the
subject
the
object
is
not
to
aggrandize
or
enrich
the
pope
he
ascends
the
papal
chair
generally
an
old
man
when
human
passion
and
human
ambition
if
any
did
exist
are
on
the
wane
his
personal
expenses
do
not
exceed
a
few
dollars
a
day
he
eats
alone
and
very
abstemiously
he
has
no
wife
no
children
to
enrich
with
the
spoils
of
office
as
he
is
an
unmarried
man
the
popedom
is
not
hereditary
like
the
sovereignty
of
england
but
elective
like
the
office
of
our
president
and
the
holy
father
is
succeeded
by
a
pontiff
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
no
family
ties
what
personal
motive
therefore
can
he
have
in
desiring
temporal
sovereignty
i
am
sure
indeed
that
if
the
holy
father
were
to
consult
his
own
taste
and
feelings
he
would
much
rather
be
free
from
the
trammels
of
civil
government
but
he
has
higher
interests
to
subserve
he
must
vindicate
the
eternal
laws
of
justice
which
have
been
violated
in
his
own
person
as
the
popes
were
not
actuated
by
a
love
of
gain
in
possessing
temporal
dominion
neither
had
they
any
desire
to
enlarge
their
territory
small
as
it
was
the
temporalities
of
the
pope
were
not
much
larger
than
the
state
of
maryland
before
he
was
deprived
of
them
by
victor
emmanuel
a
few
years
ago
and
this
is
the
little
slice
of
land
which
victor
emmanuel
wrested
from
the
holy
father
this
is
the
vineyard
which
the
modern
king
achab
wrung
from
the
unoffending
naboth
but
the
pontiff
answers
like
naboth
of
old
the
lord
be
merciful
to
me
and
not
let
me
give
thee
the
inheritance
of
my
this
is
the
little
which
the
modern
david
has
snatched
from
uriah
its
legitimate
owner
the
royal
shepherd
of
piedmont
had
already
seized
all
the
other
lambs
and
sheep
of
his
neighbors
but
he
was
not
satisfied
till
he
added
to
his
fold
the
solitary
tender
lamb
of
the
pope
let
him
take
care
however
that
the
prophecy
denounced
by
nathan
against
david
fall
not
upon
himself
and
his
posterity
why
therefore
hast
thou
despised
the
word
of
the
lord
to
do
evil
in
my
sight
therefore
the
sword
shall
never
depart
from
thy
house
because
thou
hast
despised
me
behold
i
will
raise
up
evil
against
thee
out
of
thy
own
while
the
patrimony
of
the
pope
was
large
enough
to
secure
his
independence
it
was
too
small
to
provoke
the
fear
and
jealousy
of
foreign
powers
the
authority
of
the
roman
pontiffs
in
the
middle
ages
was
almost
unbounded
had
they
wished
then
they
could
easily
have
increased
their
territory
yet
they
were
content
with
what
providence
placed
originally
in
their
hands
the
sole
end
of
the
temporal
power
has
been
to
secure
for
the
pope
independence
and
freedom
in
the
government
of
the
church
the
holy
father
must
be
either
a
sovereign
or
a
subject
there
is
no
medium
if
a
subject
he
might
become
either
the
pliant
creature
if
god
would
so
permit
of
his
royal
master
like
the
schismatic
patriarch
of
constantinople
who
as
gibbon
observed
was
a
domestic
slave
under
the
eye
of
his
master
at
whose
nod
he
passed
from
the
convent
to
the
throne
and
from
the
throne
to
the
and
indeed
the
oriental
schismatic
bishops
are
as
subservient
now
as
they
were
then
to
their
temporal
rulers
or
what
is
far
more
probable
the
pope
might
become
a
virtual
prisoner
in
his
own
house
as
the
present
illustrious
pontiff
is
at
this
moment
the
pope
is
the
representative
of
christ
on
earth
his
office
requires
him
to
be
in
constant
communication
with
prelates
in
every
country
in
the
world
should
the
kingdom
of
italy
be
embroiled
in
a
war
with
any
european
germany
for
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
the
holy
father
and
the
german
bishops
to
confer
with
each
other
and
religion
would
suffer
from
the
interruption
of
intercourse
between
the
head
and
the
members
the
interests
of
christianity
demand
that
the
vicar
of
the
prince
of
peace
should
possess
one
spot
of
territory
which
would
be
held
inviolable
so
that
all
nations
and
peoples
could
at
all
times
in
war
as
well
as
in
peace
freely
correspond
with
him
nothing
can
be
more
revolting
to
our
feelings
than
that
the
spiritual
government
of
the
church
should
be
constantly
hampered
by
the
hostile
aggressions
of
ambitious
rulers
an
eventuality
always
likely
to
occur
so
long
as
the
pope
remains
the
subject
of
any
earthly
potentate
but
we
are
told
that
the
roman
people
by
a
or
popular
vote
expressed
their
desire
to
be
annexed
to
the
piedmontese
government
to
this
i
answer
in
the
first
place
that
we
ought
to
know
what
importance
to
attach
to
elections
held
under
the
shadow
of
the
bayonet
it
is
well
known
that
the
roman
was
undertaken
by
the
authority
and
guided
by
the
inspiration
of
the
italian
troops
it
is
equally
notorious
that
the
numerous
stragglers
who
accompanied
the
italian
army
to
rome
legalized
the
gigantic
fraud
of
their
master
as
well
as
their
own
petty
thefts
by
voting
in
favor
of
annexation
in
the
second
place
the
roman
people
even
had
they
so
desired
had
no
right
to
transfer
by
suffrage
the
patrimony
of
peter
to
victor
emmanuel
they
could
not
give
what
did
not
belong
to
them
the
papal
territory
was
granted
to
the
popes
in
trust
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
is
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
catholics
of
christendom
the
catholic
world
therefore
and
not
merely
a
handful
of
roman
subjects
must
give
its
consent
before
such
a
transfer
can
be
declared
legitimate
rome
is
to
catholic
christendom
what
washington
is
to
the
united
states
as
the
citizens
of
washington
have
no
power
without
the
concurrence
of
the
united
states
to
annex
their
city
to
maryland
or
virginia
neither
can
the
citizens
of
rome
hand
over
their
city
to
the
kingdom
of
piedmont
without
the
acquiescence
of
the
faithful
dispersed
throughout
the
world
we
protest
therefore
against
the
occupation
of
rome
by
foreign
troops
as
a
act
of
injustice
and
a
gross
violation
of
the
commandment
thou
shalt
not
we
protest
against
it
as
a
royal
outrage
calculated
to
shock
the
public
sense
of
honesty
and
to
weaken
the
sacred
right
of
public
and
private
property
we
protest
against
it
as
an
unjustifiable
violation
of
solemn
treaties
we
protest
in
fine
against
the
spoliation
as
an
impious
sacrilege
because
it
is
an
unholy
seizure
of
ecclesiastical
property
and
an
attempt
as
far
as
human
agencies
can
accomplish
it
to
trammel
and
embarrass
the
free
action
of
the
head
of
the
church
iii
what
the
popes
have
done
for
rome
although
the
temporal
power
of
the
pope
is
a
subject
which
concerns
the
universal
church
no
nation
has
more
reason
to
lament
the
loss
of
the
holy
father
s
temporalities
than
the
italians
themselves
and
particularly
the
inhabitants
of
rome
it
is
the
residence
of
the
popes
in
rome
that
has
contributed
to
her
material
and
religious
grandeur
the
pontiffs
have
made
her
the
centre
of
christendom
the
queen
of
religion
the
mistress
of
arts
and
sciences
the
depository
of
sacred
learning
by
their
creative
and
conservative
spirit
they
have
saved
the
illustrious
monuments
of
the
past
and
side
by
side
with
these
they
have
raised
up
christian
temples
which
surpass
those
of
pagan
antiquity
in
looking
today
at
these
old
roman
monuments
we
know
not
which
to
admire
genius
of
those
who
designed
and
erected
them
or
the
fostering
care
of
the
popes
who
have
preserved
from
destruction
the
venerable
ruins
the
residence
of
the
popes
in
rome
has
made
her
what
she
is
truly
called
eternal
let
the
popes
leave
rome
forever
and
in
five
years
grass
will
be
growing
on
its
streets
such
was
the
case
at
the
return
of
the
pope
in
from
avignon
which
had
been
the
seat
of
the
sovereign
pontiffs
during
the
preceding
century
on
the
pope
s
return
the
city
of
rome
had
a
population
of
only
and
avignon
which
during
the
residence
of
the
popes
in
the
fourteenth
century
contained
a
population
of
has
now
a
population
of
only
inhabitants
such
also
was
the
case
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
when
pius
vii
was
an
exile
for
four
years
from
rome
and
a
prisoner
of
the
first
napoleon
in
grenoble
savona
and
fontainebleau
grass
then
grew
on
the
streets
of
rome
and
the
city
lost
of
its
population
rome
has
naturally
no
commercial
attractions
it
is
only
the
presence
of
the
pope
that
keeps
up
her
trade
let
the
popes
abandon
rome
and
her
churches
will
soon
be
without
worshipers
her
artists
without
employment
her
glorious
monuments
will
perish
science
and
art
and
sacred
literature
will
take
their
flight
and
perch
upon
some
more
favored
spot
the
hundred
thousand
and
more
strangers
who
annually
flock
to
rome
from
different
parts
of
the
world
will
shake
off
the
dust
from
their
feet
and
seek
more
congenial
cities
let
the
popes
withdraw
from
rome
and
it
may
become
almost
as
desolate
as
jerusalem
and
antioch
are
today
peter
preached
his
first
sermons
in
jerusalem
but
he
did
not
select
it
as
his
see
and
jerusalem
is
today
a
mahometan
city
with
its
sacred
places
profaned
by
the
foot
of
the
mussulman
peter
occupied
for
a
time
the
city
of
antioch
as
his
first
see
but
in
the
mysterious
providence
of
god
he
abandoned
antioch
and
repaired
to
rome
and
now
little
remains
of
the
ancient
antioch
of
peter
s
day
except
colossal
ruins
had
the
popes
remained
in
antioch
syria
would
now
very
probably
be
instead
of
europe
the
centre
of
christianity
and
civilization
the
immortal
dome
of
peter
s
would
doubtless
overshadow
the
banks
of
the
orontes
instead
of
the
tiber
and
antioch
not
rome
would
be
the
focus
of
art
science
and
sacred
literature
and
would
be
called
today
the
eternal
our
present
beloved
pontiff
pius
i
need
not
inform
you
is
now
treated
with
indignity
in
his
own
city
in
his
declining
years
as
well
as
in
the
early
days
of
his
pontificate
he
is
made
to
drink
deep
of
the
chalice
of
affliction
his
name
is
dear
to
us
all
to
many
of
us
it
is
a
name
familiar
from
our
youth
for
years
have
now
elapsed
since
he
first
assumed
the
reins
of
government
and
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
since
the
days
of
peter
no
pope
has
ever
reigned
so
long
as
pius
ix
the
pope
in
every
age
like
his
divine
master
has
his
period
of
persecution
and
his
period
of
peace
like
him
he
has
his
days
of
sorrow
and
his
days
of
joy
his
days
of
humiliation
and
death
his
days
of
exaltation
and
glory
like
jesus
christ
he
is
one
day
greeted
with
acclamations
as
king
and
another
day
crucified
by
his
enemies
but
never
does
the
holy
father
exhibit
his
title
as
vicar
of
christ
more
strikingly
than
in
the
midst
of
tribulations
if
he
did
not
suffer
he
would
bear
no
resemblance
to
his
divine
model
and
master
and
never
does
he
more
worthily
deserve
the
filial
homage
of
his
children
than
when
he
is
heavily
laden
with
the
cross
i
envy
neither
the
heart
nor
the
head
of
those
men
who
are
now
gloating
with
fiendish
joy
over
the
calamities
of
the
pope
who
are
heaping
insults
and
calumnies
on
his
venerable
head
while
he
is
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
who
are
confidently
predicting
the
downfall
of
the
papacy
from
the
present
situation
of
the
head
of
the
church
as
if
the
temporary
privation
of
his
dominions
involved
their
irrevocable
loss
or
as
if
even
the
perpetual
destruction
of
the
temporal
power
involved
the
destruction
of
the
spiritual
supremacy
itself
the
papacy
they
say
is
gone
its
glory
is
vanished
its
sun
is
set
it
is
sunk
below
the
horizon
never
to
rise
prophets
will
you
never
profit
by
the
lessons
of
history
have
not
numbers
of
popes
before
pius
ix
been
forcibly
ejected
from
their
see
and
have
they
not
been
reinstated
in
their
temporal
authority
what
has
happened
so
often
before
may
and
will
happen
again
for
our
part
we
have
every
confidence
that
ere
long
the
clouds
which
now
overshadow
the
civil
throne
of
the
pope
will
be
removed
by
the
breath
of
a
righteous
god
and
that
his
temporal
power
will
be
on
a
more
permanent
basis
than
ever
but
whatever
be
the
fate
of
the
pope
s
temporalities
we
have
no
fears
for
the
spiritual
throne
of
the
papacy
the
pontiffs
have
received
their
earthly
dominion
from
man
and
what
man
gives
man
may
take
away
but
the
spiritual
supremacy
the
bishops
of
rome
have
from
god
and
no
man
can
destroy
it
that
divine
charter
of
their
prerogatives
thou
art
peter
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
will
ever
shine
forth
as
brightly
as
the
sun
and
it
is
as
far
as
the
sun
above
the
reach
of
human
aggression
the
holy
father
may
live
and
die
in
the
catacombs
as
the
early
pontiffs
did
for
the
first
three
centuries
he
may
be
dragged
from
his
see
and
perish
in
exile
like
the
martins
the
gregories
and
the
piuses
he
may
wander
a
penniless
pilgrim
like
peter
himself
rome
itself
may
sink
beneath
the
mediterranean
but
the
chair
of
peter
will
stand
and
peter
will
live
in
his
successors
chapter
xiii
the
invocation
of
saints
christians
of
most
denominations
are
accustomed
to
recite
the
following
article
contained
in
the
apostles
creed
i
believe
in
the
communion
of
there
are
many
i
fear
who
have
these
words
frequently
on
their
lips
without
an
adequate
knowledge
of
the
precious
meaning
which
they
convey
the
true
and
obvious
sense
of
the
words
quoted
from
the
creed
is
that
between
the
children
of
god
whether
reigning
in
heaven
or
sojourning
on
earth
there
exists
an
intercommunion
or
spiritual
communication
by
prayer
and
consequently
that
our
friends
who
have
entered
into
their
rest
are
mindful
of
us
in
their
petitions
to
god
in
the
exposition
of
her
creed
the
catholic
church
weighs
her
words
in
the
scales
of
the
sanctuary
with
as
much
precision
as
a
banker
weighs
his
gold
with
regard
to
the
invocation
of
saints
the
church
simply
declares
that
it
is
useful
and
salutary
to
ask
their
prayers
there
are
expressions
addressed
to
the
saints
in
some
popular
books
of
devotion
which
to
critical
readers
may
seem
extravagant
but
they
are
only
the
warm
language
of
affection
and
poetry
to
be
regulated
by
our
standard
of
faith
and
notice
that
all
the
prayers
of
the
church
end
with
the
formula
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
sufficiently
indicating
her
belief
that
christ
is
the
mediator
of
salvation
a
heart
tenderly
attached
to
the
saints
will
give
vent
to
its
feelings
in
the
language
of
hyperbole
just
as
an
enthusiastic
lover
will
call
his
future
bride
his
adorable
queen
without
any
intention
of
worshiping
her
as
a
goddess
this
reflection
should
be
borne
in
mind
while
reading
such
passages
i
might
easily
show
by
voluminous
quotations
from
ecclesiastical
writers
of
the
first
ages
of
the
church
how
conformable
to
the
teaching
of
antiquity
is
the
catholic
practice
of
invoking
the
intercession
of
the
saints
but
as
you
dear
reader
may
not
be
disposed
to
attach
adequate
importance
to
the
writings
of
the
fathers
i
shall
confine
myself
to
the
testimony
of
holy
scripture
you
will
readily
admit
that
it
is
a
salutary
custom
to
ask
the
prayers
of
the
blessed
in
heaven
provided
you
have
no
doubt
that
they
can
your
prayers
and
that
they
have
the
and
the
to
assist
you
now
the
scriptures
amply
demonstrate
the
knowledge
the
influence
and
the
love
of
the
saints
in
our
regard
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
angels
and
saints
reigning
with
god
see
and
hear
in
the
same
manner
that
we
see
and
hear
on
earth
or
that
knowledge
is
communicated
to
them
as
it
is
communicated
to
us
while
we
are
confined
in
the
prison
of
the
body
we
see
only
with
our
eyes
and
hear
with
our
ears
hence
our
faculties
of
vision
and
hearing
are
very
limited
compared
with
the
heavenly
inhabitants
we
are
like
a
man
in
a
darksome
cell
through
which
a
dim
ray
of
light
penetrates
he
observes
but
few
objects
and
these
very
obscurely
but
as
soon
as
our
soul
is
freed
from
the
body
soaring
heavenward
like
a
bird
released
from
its
cage
its
vision
is
at
once
marvelously
enlarged
it
requires
neither
eyes
to
see
nor
ears
to
hear
but
beholds
all
things
in
god
as
in
a
mirror
we
now
says
the
apostle
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
now
i
know
in
part
but
then
i
shall
know
even
as
i
am
in
our
day
we
know
what
wonderful
facility
we
have
in
communicating
with
our
friends
at
a
distance
a
message
to
berlin
or
rome
with
the
answer
which
a
century
ago
would
require
sixty
days
in
transmission
can
now
be
accomplished
in
sixty
minutes
i
can
hold
a
conversation
with
an
acquaintance
in
san
francisco
three
thousand
miles
away
and
can
talk
to
him
as
easily
and
expeditiously
as
if
he
were
closeted
with
me
here
in
baltimore
nay
more
we
can
distinctly
recognize
one
another
by
the
sound
of
our
voice
if
a
scientist
had
predicted
such
events
a
hundred
years
past
he
would
be
regarded
as
demented
and
yet
he
would
not
be
a
visionary
but
a
prophet
let
us
not
be
unwise
in
measuring
divine
power
by
our
finite
reason
if
such
revelations
are
made
in
the
natural
order
what
may
we
not
expect
in
the
supernatural
world
if
science
gives
us
such
rapid
and
easy
means
of
corresponding
with
our
fellow
beings
on
foreign
shores
what
methods
may
not
the
god
of
sciences
employ
to
enable
us
to
communicate
with
our
brethren
on
the
shores
of
eternity
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
that
the
spirits
of
the
just
in
heaven
are
clearly
conversant
with
our
affairs
on
earth
is
manifest
from
the
following
passages
of
holy
writ
the
venerable
patriarch
jacob
when
on
his
deathbed
prayed
thus
for
his
two
grandchildren
may
the
angel
that
delivereth
me
from
all
evils
bless
these
boys
here
we
see
a
holy
singularly
favored
by
almighty
god
and
enlightened
by
many
supernatural
visions
the
father
of
jehovah
s
chosen
the
angel
in
heaven
to
obtain
a
blessing
for
his
grandchildren
and
surely
we
can
not
suppose
that
he
would
be
so
ignorant
as
to
pray
to
one
that
could
not
hear
him
the
angel
raphael
after
having
disclosed
himself
to
tobias
said
to
him
when
thou
didst
pray
with
tears
and
didst
bury
the
dead
and
didst
leave
thy
dinner
i
offered
thy
prayer
to
the
how
could
the
angel
if
he
were
ignorant
of
these
petitions
have
presented
to
god
the
prayers
of
tobias
to
pass
from
the
old
to
the
new
testament
our
savior
declares
that
there
shall
be
joy
before
the
angels
of
god
upon
one
sinner
doing
then
the
angels
are
glad
whenever
you
repent
of
your
sins
now
what
is
repentance
it
is
a
change
of
heart
it
is
an
interior
operation
of
the
will
the
saints
therefore
are
know
not
only
with
your
actions
and
words
but
even
with
your
very
thoughts
and
when
paul
says
that
we
are
made
a
spectacle
to
the
world
to
angels
and
to
men
what
does
he
mean
unless
that
as
our
actions
are
seen
by
men
even
so
they
are
visible
to
the
angels
in
heaven
the
examples
i
have
quoted
refer
it
is
true
to
the
angels
but
our
lord
declares
that
the
saints
in
heaven
shall
be
like
the
angelic
spirits
by
possessing
the
same
knowledge
enjoying
the
same
happiness
we
read
in
the
gospel
that
dives
while
suffering
in
the
place
of
the
reprobates
earnestly
besought
abraham
to
cool
his
burning
thirst
and
abraham
in
his
abode
of
rest
after
death
was
able
to
listen
and
reply
to
him
now
if
communication
could
exist
between
the
souls
of
the
just
and
of
the
reprobate
how
much
easier
is
it
to
suppose
that
interchange
of
thought
can
exist
between
the
saints
in
heaven
and
their
brethren
on
earth
these
few
instances
are
sufficient
to
convince
you
that
the
spirits
in
heaven
hear
our
prayers
have
also
abundant
testimony
from
scripture
to
show
that
the
saints
assist
us
by
their
prayers
almighty
god
threatened
the
inhabitants
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
with
utter
destruction
on
account
of
their
crimes
and
abominations
abraham
interposes
in
their
behalf
and
in
response
to
his
prayer
god
consents
to
spare
those
cities
if
only
ten
just
men
are
found
therein
here
the
avenging
hand
of
god
is
suspended
and
the
fire
of
his
wrath
withheld
through
the
efficacy
of
the
prayers
of
a
single
man
we
read
in
the
book
of
exodus
that
when
the
amalekites
were
about
to
wage
war
on
the
children
of
israel
moses
the
great
servant
and
prophet
of
the
lord
went
upon
a
mountain
to
pray
for
the
success
of
his
people
and
the
scriptures
inform
us
that
whenever
moses
raised
his
hands
in
prayer
the
israelites
were
victorious
but
when
he
ceased
to
pray
amalek
conquered
could
the
power
of
intercessory
prayer
be
manifested
in
a
more
striking
manner
the
silent
prayer
of
moses
on
the
mountain
was
more
formidable
to
the
amalekites
than
the
sword
of
josue
and
his
armed
hosts
fighting
in
the
valley
when
the
same
hebrew
people
were
banished
from
their
native
country
and
carried
into
exile
in
babylon
so
great
was
their
confidence
in
the
prayers
of
their
brethren
in
jerusalem
that
they
sent
them
the
following
message
together
with
a
sum
of
money
that
sacrifice
might
be
offered
up
for
them
in
the
holy
city
pray
ye
for
us
to
the
lord
our
god
for
we
have
sinned
against
the
lord
our
when
the
friends
of
job
had
excited
the
indignation
of
the
almighty
in
consequence
of
their
vain
speech
god
instead
of
directly
granting
them
the
pardon
which
they
sought
commanded
them
to
invoke
the
intercession
of
job
go
he
says
to
my
servant
job
and
offer
for
yourselves
a
holocaust
and
my
servant
job
will
pray
for
you
and
his
face
will
i
nor
did
they
appeal
to
job
in
vain
for
the
lord
was
turned
at
the
penance
of
job
when
he
prayed
for
his
in
this
instance
we
not
only
see
the
value
of
intercessory
prayer
but
we
find
god
sanctioning
it
by
his
own
authority
but
of
all
the
sacred
writers
there
is
none
that
reposes
greater
confidence
in
the
prayers
of
his
brethren
than
paul
although
no
one
had
a
better
knowledge
than
he
of
the
infinite
merits
of
our
savior
s
passion
and
no
one
could
have
more
endeared
himself
to
god
by
his
personal
labors
in
his
epistles
paul
repeatedly
asks
for
himself
the
prayers
of
his
disciples
if
he
wishes
to
be
delivered
from
the
hands
of
the
unbelievers
of
judea
and
his
ministry
to
be
successful
in
jerusalem
he
asks
the
romans
to
obtain
these
favors
for
him
if
he
desires
the
grace
of
preaching
with
profit
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
he
invokes
the
intercession
of
the
ephesians
nay
is
it
not
a
common
practice
among
ourselves
and
even
among
our
dissenting
brethren
to
ask
the
prayers
of
one
another
when
a
father
is
about
to
leave
his
house
on
a
long
journey
the
instinct
of
piety
prompts
him
to
say
to
his
wife
and
children
remember
me
in
your
now
i
ask
you
if
our
friends
though
sinners
can
aid
us
by
their
prayers
why
can
not
our
friends
the
saints
of
god
be
able
to
assist
us
also
if
abraham
and
moses
and
job
exercised
so
much
influence
with
the
almighty
while
they
lived
in
the
flesh
is
their
power
with
god
diminished
now
that
they
reign
with
him
in
heaven
we
are
moved
by
the
children
of
israel
sending
their
pious
petitions
to
their
brethren
in
jerusalem
they
recalled
to
mind
no
doubt
what
the
lord
said
to
solomon
after
he
had
completed
the
temple
my
eyes
shall
be
open
and
my
ears
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
him
that
shall
pray
in
this
if
the
supplications
of
those
that
prayed
in
the
earthly
jerusalem
were
so
efficacious
what
will
god
refuse
to
those
who
pray
to
him
face
to
face
in
the
heavenly
jerusalem
you
will
ask
are
the
saints
in
heaven
so
interested
in
our
welfare
as
to
be
mindful
of
us
in
their
prayers
or
are
they
so
much
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
god
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
celestial
bliss
as
to
be
altogether
regardless
of
their
friends
on
earth
far
from
us
the
suspicion
that
the
saints
reigning
with
god
ever
forget
us
in
heaven
charity
is
triumphant
and
how
can
the
saints
have
love
and
yet
be
unmindful
of
their
brethren
on
earth
if
they
have
one
desire
greater
than
another
it
is
to
see
us
one
day
wearing
the
crowns
that
await
us
in
heaven
if
they
were
capable
of
experiencing
sorrow
their
grief
would
spring
from
the
consideration
that
we
do
not
always
walk
in
their
footsteps
here
so
as
to
make
sure
our
election
to
eternal
glory
hereafter
the
hebrew
people
believed
like
us
that
the
saints
after
death
were
occupied
in
praying
for
us
we
read
in
the
book
of
maccabees
that
judas
maccabeus
the
night
before
he
engaged
in
battle
with
the
army
of
the
impious
nicanor
had
a
supernatural
dream
or
vision
in
which
he
beheld
onias
the
and
the
prophet
jeremiah
both
of
whom
had
been
long
dead
onias
appeared
to
him
with
outstretched
arms
praying
for
the
people
of
god
pointing
to
jeremiah
he
said
to
judas
maccabeus
this
is
a
lover
of
his
brethren
and
the
people
of
israel
this
is
he
that
prayeth
much
for
the
people
and
for
all
the
holy
city
jeremiah
the
prophet
of
then
jeremiah
as
is
related
in
the
sequel
of
the
vision
handed
a
sword
to
judas
with
which
the
prophet
predicted
that
judas
would
conquer
his
enemies
the
soldiers
animated
by
the
relation
of
judas
fought
with
invincible
courage
and
overcame
the
enemy
the
book
of
maccabees
though
not
admitted
by
our
dissenting
brethren
to
be
inspired
must
at
least
be
acknowledged
by
them
to
be
a
faithful
historical
record
it
is
manifest
therefore
from
this
narrative
that
the
hebrew
people
believed
that
the
saints
in
heaven
pray
for
their
brethren
on
earth
john
in
his
revelation
describes
the
saints
before
the
throne
of
god
praying
for
their
earthly
brethren
the
four
and
twenty
ancients
fell
down
before
the
lamb
having
every
one
of
them
harps
and
golden
vials
full
of
odors
which
are
the
prayers
of
the
the
prophet
zachariah
records
a
prayer
that
was
offered
by
the
angel
for
the
people
of
god
and
the
favorable
answer
which
came
from
heaven
how
long
o
lord
wilt
thou
not
have
mercy
on
jerusalem
and
on
the
cities
of
juda
with
which
thou
hast
been
angry
and
the
lord
answered
the
angel
good
words
comfortable
nor
can
we
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
angels
labor
for
our
salvation
since
we
are
told
by
peter
that
the
devil
goeth
about
like
a
roaring
lion
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
for
if
hate
impels
the
demons
to
ruin
us
surely
love
must
inspire
the
angels
to
help
us
in
securing
the
crown
of
glory
and
if
the
angels
though
of
a
different
nature
from
ours
are
so
mindful
of
us
how
much
more
interest
do
the
saints
manifest
in
our
welfare
who
are
bone
of
our
bone
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
to
ask
the
prayers
of
our
brethren
in
heaven
is
not
only
conformable
to
holy
scripture
but
is
prompted
by
the
instincts
of
our
nature
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
communion
of
saints
robs
death
of
its
terrors
while
the
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
denying
the
communion
of
saints
not
only
inflicted
a
deadly
wound
on
the
creed
but
also
severed
the
tenderest
chords
of
the
human
heart
they
broke
asunder
the
holy
ties
that
unite
earth
with
soul
in
the
flesh
with
the
soul
released
from
the
flesh
if
my
brother
leaves
me
to
cross
the
seas
i
believe
that
he
continues
to
pray
for
me
and
when
he
crosses
the
narrow
sea
of
death
and
lands
on
the
shores
of
eternity
why
should
he
not
pray
for
me
still
what
does
death
destroy
the
body
the
soul
still
lives
and
moves
and
has
its
being
it
thinks
and
wills
and
remembers
and
loves
the
dross
of
sin
and
selfishness
and
hatred
are
burned
by
the
salutary
fires
of
contrition
and
nothing
remains
but
the
pure
gold
of
charity
o
far
be
from
us
the
dreary
thought
that
death
cuts
off
our
friends
entirely
from
us
far
be
from
us
the
heartless
creed
which
declares
a
perpetual
divorce
between
us
and
the
just
in
heaven
do
not
imagine
when
you
lose
a
father
or
mother
a
tender
sister
or
brother
who
die
in
the
peace
of
christ
that
they
are
forgetful
of
you
the
love
they
bore
you
on
earth
is
purified
and
intensified
in
heaven
or
if
your
innocent
child
regenerated
in
the
waters
of
baptism
is
snatched
from
you
by
death
be
assured
that
though
separated
from
you
in
body
that
child
is
with
you
in
spirit
and
is
repaying
you
a
for
the
natural
life
it
received
from
you
be
convinced
that
the
golden
link
of
prayer
binds
you
to
that
angelic
infant
and
that
it
is
continually
offering
its
fervent
petitions
at
the
throne
of
god
for
you
that
you
may
both
be
reunited
in
heaven
but
i
hear
men
cry
out
with
pharisaical
assurance
you
dishonor
god
sir
in
praying
to
the
saints
you
make
void
the
mediatorship
of
jesus
christ
you
put
the
creature
above
the
how
utterly
groundless
is
this
objection
we
do
not
dishonor
god
in
praying
to
the
saints
we
should
indeed
dishonor
him
if
we
consulted
the
saints
of
god
but
such
is
not
our
practice
the
catholic
church
teaches
on
the
contrary
that
god
alone
is
the
giver
of
all
good
gifts
that
he
is
the
source
of
all
blessings
the
fountain
of
all
goodness
she
teaches
that
whatever
happiness
or
glory
or
the
saints
possess
all
comes
from
god
as
the
moon
borrows
her
light
from
the
sun
so
do
the
blessed
borrow
their
light
from
jesus
the
sun
of
justice
the
one
mediator
of
redemption
of
god
and
hence
when
we
address
the
saints
we
beg
them
to
pray
for
us
through
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
while
we
ask
jesus
to
help
up
through
his
own
merits
but
what
is
the
use
of
praying
to
the
saints
since
god
can
hear
us
if
it
is
vain
and
useless
to
pray
to
the
saints
because
god
can
hear
us
then
jacob
was
wrong
in
praying
to
the
angel
the
friends
of
job
were
wrong
in
asking
him
to
pray
for
them
though
god
commanded
them
to
invoke
job
s
intercession
the
jews
exiled
in
babylon
were
wrong
in
asking
their
brethren
in
jerusalem
to
pray
for
them
paul
was
wrong
in
beseeching
his
friends
to
pray
for
him
then
we
are
all
wrong
in
praying
for
each
other
you
deem
it
useful
and
pious
to
ask
your
pastor
to
pray
for
you
is
it
not
at
least
equally
useful
for
me
to
invoke
the
prayers
of
paul
since
i
am
convinced
that
he
can
hear
me
god
forbid
that
our
supplications
to
our
father
in
heaven
should
diminish
in
proportion
as
our
prayers
to
the
saints
increase
for
after
all
we
must
remember
that
while
the
church
declares
it
necessary
for
salvation
to
pray
to
god
she

it

prayers
of

saints
far
from
being

is
most
profitable
by
invoking
their
intercession
instead
of

we
have
many
praying
for
us
to

to

to
their
god
and
to
our

to
their

and
to
our
father
that
we
may

country
in
company

common
redeemer
jesus
christ
with

chapter
xiv
is
it
lawful
to
honor
the
blessed
virgin
mary
as
a
saint
to
invoke
her
as
an
intercessor
and
to
imitate
her
as
a
model
i
is
it
lawful
to
honor
her
the
sincere
adorers
and
lovers
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
look
with
reverence
on
every
object
with
which
he
was
associated
and
they
conceive
an
affection
for
every
person
that
was
near
and
dear
to
him
on
earth
the
closer
the
intimacy
of
those
persons
with
our
savior
the
holier
do
they
appear
in
our
estimation
just
as
those
planets
which
revolve
the
nearest
around
the
sun
partake
most
of
its
light
and
heat
there
is
something
hallowed
to
the
eye
of
the
christian
in
the
very
soil
of
judea
because
it
was
pressed
by
the
footprints
of
our
blessed
redeemer
with
what
reverent
steps
we
would
enter
the
cave
of
bethlehem
because
was
born
the
savior
of
the
world
with
what
religious
demeanor
we
would
tread
the
streets
of
nazareth
when
we
remembered
that
were
spent
the
days
of
his
boyhood
what
profound
religious
awe
would
fill
our
hearts
on
ascending
mount
calvary
where
he
paid
by
his
blood
the
ransom
of
our
souls
but
if
the
soil
claims
so
much
reverence
how
much
more
veneration
would
be
enkindled
in
our
hearts
for
the
persons
who
were
the
friends
and
associates
of
our
savior
on
earth
we
know
that
he
exercised
a
certain
salutary
and
magnetic
influence
on
those
whom
he
approached
all
the
multitude
sought
to
touch
him
for
virtue
went
out
from
him
and
healed
all
as
happened
to
the
woman
who
had
been
troubled
with
an
issue
of
blood
we
would
seem
indeed
to
draw
near
to
jesus
if
we
had
the
happiness
of
only
conversing
with
the
samaritan
woman
or
of
eating
at
the
table
of
zaccheus
or
of
being
entertained
by
nicodemus
but
if
we
were
admitted
into
the
inner
circle
of
his
lazarus
mary
and
martha
for
baptist
or
the
apostles
we
would
be
conscious
that
in
their
company
we
were
drawing
still
nearer
to
jesus
and
imbibing
somewhat
of
that
spirit
which
they
must
have
largely
received
from
their
familiar
relations
with
him
now
if
the
land
of
judea
is
looked
upon
as
hallowed
ground
because
jesus
dwelt
there
if
the
apostles
were
considered
as
models
of
holiness
because
they
were
the
chosen
companions
and
pupils
of
our
lord
in
his
latter
years
how
peerless
must
have
been
the
sanctity
of
mary
who
gave
him
birth
whose
breast
was
his
pillow
who
nursed
and
clothed
him
in
infancy
who
guided
his
early
steps
who
accompanied
him
in
his
exile
to
egypt
and
back
who
abode
with
him
from
infancy
to
boyhood
from
boyhood
to
manhood
who
during
all
that
time
listened
to
the
words
of
wisdom
which
fell
from
his
lips
who
was
the
first
to
embrace
him
at
his
birth
and
the
last
to
receive
his
dying
breath
on
calvary
this
sentiment
is
so
natural
to
us
that
we
find
it
bursting
forth
spontaneously
from
the
lips
of
the
woman
of
the
gospel
who
hearing
the
words
of
jesus
full
of
wisdom
and
sanctity
lifted
up
her
voice
and
said
to
him
blessed
is
the
womb
that
bore
thee
and
the
paps
that
gave
thee
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
economy
of
divine
providence
that
whenever
god
designs
any
person
for
some
important
work
he
bestows
on
that
person
the
graces
and
dispositions
necessary
for
faithfully
discharging
it
when
moses
was
called
by
heaven
to
be
the
leader
of
the
hebrew
people
he
hesitated
to
assume
the
formidable
office
on
the
plea
of
impediment
and
slowness
of
but
jehovah
reassured
him
by
promising
to
qualify
him
for
the
sublime
functions
assigned
to
him
i
will
be
in
thy
mouth
and
i
will
teach
thee
what
thou
shalt
the
prophet
jeremiah
was
sanctified
from
his
very
birth
because
he
was
destined
to
be
the
herald
of
god
s
law
to
the
children
of
israel
before
i
formed
thee
in
the
bowels
of
thy
mother
i
knew
thee
and
before
thou
camest
forth
out
of
the
womb
i
sanctified
elizabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
that
she
might
be
worthy
to
be
the
hostess
of
our
lord
during
the
three
months
that
mary
dwelt
under
her
roof
john
the
baptist
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
even
from
his
mother
s
he
was
a
burning
and
a
shining
light
because
he
was
chosen
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
the
apostles
received
the
plenitude
of
grace
they
were
endowed
with
the
gift
of
tongue
and
other
privileges
before
they
commenced
the
work
of
the
ministry
hence
paul
says
our
sufficiency
is
from
god
who
hath
made
us
ministers
of
the
new
now
of
all
who
have
participated
in
the
ministry
of
the
redemption
there
is
none
who
filled
any
position
so
exalted
so
sacred
as
is
the
incommunicable
office
of
mother
of
jesus
and
there
is
no
one
consequently
that
so
high
a
degree
of
holiness
as
she
did
for
if
god
thus
sanctified
his
prophets
and
apostles
as
being
destined
to
be
the
bearers
of
the
word
of
life
how
much
more
sanctified
must
mary
have
been
who
was
to
bear
the
lord
and
author
of
if
john
was
so
holy
because
he
was
chosen
as
the
pioneer
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
lord
how
much
more
holy
was
she
who
ushered
him
into
the
world
if
holiness
became
john
s
mother
surely
a
greater
holiness
became
the
mother
of
john
s
master
if
god
said
to
his
priests
of
old
be
ye
clean
you
that
carry
the
vessels
of
the
lord
nay
if
the
vessels
themselves
used
in
the
divine
service
and
churches
are
set
apart
by
special
consecration
we
can
not
conceive
mary
to
have
been
ever
profaned
by
sin
who
was
the
chosen
vessel
of
election
even
the
mother
of
god
when
we
call
the
blessed
virgin
the
mother
of
god
we
assert
our
belief
in
two
things
her
son
jesus
christ
is
true
man
else
she
were
not
a
he
is
true
god
else
she
were
not
the
of
in
other
words
we
affirm
that
the
second
person
of
the
blessed
trinity
the
word
of
god
who
in
his
divine
nature
is
from
all
eternity
begotten
of
the
father
consubstantial
with
him
was
in
the
fulness
of
time
again
begotten
by
being
born
of
the
virgin
thus
taking
to
himself
from
her
maternal
womb
a
human
nature
of
the
same
substance
with
hers
but
it
may
be
said
the
blessed
virgin
is
not
the
mother
of
the
divinity
she
had
not
and
she
could
not
have
any
part
in
the
generation
of
the
word
of
god
for
that
generation
is
eternal
her
maternity
is
temporal
he
is
her
creator
she
is
his
creature
style
her
if
you
will
the
mother
of
the
man
jesus
or
even
of
the
human
nature
of
the
son
of
god
but
not
the
mother
of
god
i
shall
answer
this
objection
by
putting
a
question
did
the
mother
who
bore
us
have
any
part
in
the
production
of
our
was
not
this
nobler
part
of
our
being
the
work
of
god
alone
and
yet
who
would
for
a
moment
dream
of
saying
the
mother
of
my
body
and
not
mother
the
comparison
teaches
us
that
the
terms
parent
and
child
mother
and
son
refer
to
the
persons
and
not
to
the
parts
or
elements
of
which
the
persons
are
composed
hence
no
one
says
the
mother
of
my
the
mother
of
my
but
in
all
propriety
my
mother
the
mother
of
me
who
live
and
breathe
think
and
act
in
my
personality
though
uniting
in
it
a
soul
directly
created
by
god
and
a
material
body
directly
derived
from
the
maternal
womb
in
like
manner
as
far
as
the
sublime
mystery
of
the
incarnation
can
be
reflected
in
the
natural
order
the
blessed
virgin
under
the
overshadowing
of
the
holy
ghost
by
communicating
to
the
second
person
of
the
adorable
trinity
as
mothers
do
a
true
human
nature
of
the
same
substance
with
her
own
is
thereby
really
and
truly
his
mother
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
title
of
of
denied
by
nestorius
was
vindicated
to
her
by
the
general
council
of
ephesus
in
in
this
sense
and
in
no
other
has
the
church
called
her
by
that
title
hence
by
immediate
and
necessary
consequence
follow
her
surpassing
dignity
and
excellence
and
her
special
relationship
and
affinity
not
only
with
her
divine
son
but
also
with
the
father
and
the
holy
ghost
mary
as
wordsworth
beautifully
expressed
it
united
in
her
person
a
mother
s
love
with
maiden
the
church
teaches
us
that
she
was
always
a
virgin
before
her
espousals
during
her
married
life
and
after
her
spouse
s
death
the
angel
gabriel
was
sent
from
god
to
a
virgin
espoused
to
a
man
whose
name
was
joseph
and
the
virgin
s
name
was
that
she
remained
a
virgin
till
after
the
birth
of
jesus
is
expressly
stated
in
the
gospel
it
is
not
less
certain
that
she
continued
in
the
same
state
during
the
remainder
of
her
days
for
in
the
apostles
and
the
nicene
creed
she
is
called
a
virgin
and
that
epithet
can
not
be
restricted
to
the
time
of
our
saviour
s
birth
it
must
be
referred
to
her
whole
life
inasmuch
as
both
creeds
were
compiled
long
after
she
had
passed
away
the
canon
of
the
mass
which
is
very
probably
of
apostolic
antiquity
speaks
of
her
as
the
glorious
and
in
this
sentiment
all
catholic
tradition
concurs
there
is
a
propriety
which
suggests
itself
to
every
christian
in
mary
s
remaining
a
virgin
after
the
birth
of
jesus
for
as
bishop
bull
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
england
remarks
it
can
not
with
decency
be
imagined
that
the
most
holy
vessel
which
was
once
consecrated
to
be
a
receptacle
of
the
deity
should
be
afterwards
desecrated
and
profaned
by
human
the
learned
grotius
calvin
and
other
eminent
protestant
writers
hold
the
same
view
the
doctrine
of
the
perpetual
virginity
of
mary
is
now
combated
by
protestants
as
it
was
in
the
early
days
of
the
church
by
helvidius
and
jovinian
on
the
following
grounds
evangelist
says
that
joseph
took
unto
him
his
wife
and
he
knew
her
not
she
brought
forth
her
this
sentence
suggests
to
dissenters
that
other
children
besides
jesus
were
born
to
mary
but
the
qualifying
word
by
no
means
implies
that
the
chaste
union
which
had
subsisted
between
mary
and
joseph
up
to
the
birth
of
our
lord
was
subsequently
altered
the
protestant
hooker
justly
complains
of
the
early
heretics
as
having
abused
greatly
these
words
of
matthew
gathering
against
the
honor
of
the
blessed
virgin
that
a
thing
denied
with
special
circumstance
doth
import
an
opposite
affirmation
when
once
that
circumstance
is
to
express
hooker
s
idea
in
plainer
words
when
a
thing
is
said
not
to
have
occurred
until
another
event
had
happened
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
it
did
occur
after
that
event
took
place
the
scripture
says
that
the
raven
went
forth
from
the
ark
and
did
not
return
the
waters
were
dried
up
upon
the
earth
is
it
never
returned
samuel
saw
saul
no
more
the
day
of
his
he
did
not
of
course
see
him
after
death
the
lord
said
to
my
lord
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
i
make
thy
enemies
thy
these
words
apply
to
our
savior
who
did
not
cease
to
sit
at
the
right
of
god
after
his
enemies
were
subdued
jesus
is
called
mary
s
son
and
does
not
a
always
imply
the
subsequent
birth
of
other
children
to
the
same
mother
by
no
means
for
the
name
of
was
given
to
the
first
son
of
every
jewish
mother
whether
other
children
followed
or
not
we
find
this
epithet
applied
to
machir
for
instance
who
was
the
only
son
of
manasses
is
not
mention
frequently
made
of
the
brethren
of
jesus
fortunately
the
gospels
themselves
will
enable
us
to
trace
the
maternity
of
those
who
are
called
his
brothers
not
to
the
blessed
virgin
but
to
another
mary
matthew
mentions
by
name
james
and
joseph
among
the
brethren
of
jesus
and
the
same
evangelist
and
also
mark
tell
us
that
among
those
who
were
present
at
the
crucifixion
were
mary
magdalen
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
joseph
and
john
who
narrates
with
more
detail
the
circumstances
of
the
crucifixion
informs
us
who
this
second
mary
was
for
he
says
that
there
stood
by
the
cross
of
jesus
his
mother
and
his
mother
s
sister
mary
of
cleophas
and
mary
magdalen
there
is
no
doubt
that
mary
of
cleophas
is
identical
with
mary
who
is
called
by
matthew
and
mark
the
mother
of
james
and
joseph
and
as
mary
of
cleophas
was
the
kinswoman
of
the
blessed
virgin
james
and
joseph
are
called
the
brothers
of
jesus
in
conformity
with
the
hebrew
practice
of
giving
that
appellation
to
cousins
or
near
relations
abraham
for
instance
was
the
uncle
of
lot
yet
he
calls
him
brother
mary
is
exalted
above
all
other
women
not
only
because
she
united
a
mother
s
love
with
maiden
purity
but
also
because
she
was
conceived
without
original
sin
the
dogma
of
the
immaculate
conception
is
thus
expressed
by
the
church
we
define
that
the
blessed
virgin
mary
in
the
first
moment
of
her
conception
by
the
singular
grace
and
privilege
of
almighty
god
in
virtue
of
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
the
savior
of
the
human
race
was
preserved
free
from
every
stain
of
original
unlike
the
rest
of
the
children
of
adam
the
soul
of
mary
was
never
subject
to
sin
even
in
the
first
moment
of
its
infusion
into
the
body
she
alone
was
exempt
from
the
original
taint
this
immunity
of
mary
from
original
sin
is
exclusively
due
to
the
merits
of
christ
as
the
church
expressly
declares
she
needed
a
redeemer
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
human
race
and
therefore
was
redeemed
but
in
a
more
sublime
mary
is
as
much
indebted
to
the
precious
blood
of
jesus
for
having
been
as
we
are
for
having
been
from
original
sin
although
the
immaculate
conception
was
not
formulated
into
a
dogma
of
faith
till
it
is
at
least
implied
in
holy
scripture
it
is
in
strict
harmony
with
the
place
which
mary
holds
in
the
economy
of
redemption
and
has
virtually
received
the
pious
assent
of
the
faithful
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
church
in
genesis
we
read
i
will
put
enmities
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
thy
seed
and
her
seed
she
shall
crush
thy
all
catholic
commentators
ancient
and
modern
recognize
in
the
seed
the
woman
and
the
serpent
types
of
our
savior
of
mary
and
the
devil
god
here
declares
that
the
enmity
of
the
seed
and
that
of
the
woman
toward
the
tempter
were
to
be
identical
now
the
enmity
of
christ
or
the
seed
toward
the
evil
one
was
absolute
and
perpetual
therefore
the
enmity
of
mary
or
the
woman
toward
the
devil
never
admitted
of
any
momentary
reconciliation
which
would
have
existed
if
she
were
ever
subject
to
original
sin
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
as
three
characters
appear
on
the
scene
of
our
eve
and
the
rebellious
three
corresponding
personages

in
our
christ
who
is
the
second
adam
mary
the
second
eve
and
the
archangel
gabriel
the
second
adam
was
immeasurably
superior
to
the
first
gabriel
was
superior
to
the
fallen
angel
and
hence
we
are
warranted
by
analogy
to
conclude
that
mary
was
superior
to
eve
but
if
she
had
been
created
in
original
sin
instead
of
being
superior
she
would
be
inferior
to
eve
who
was
certainly
created
immaculate
we
can
not
conceive
that
the
mother
of
cain
was
created
superior
to
the
mother
of
jesus
it
would
have
been
unworthy
of
a
god
of
infinite
purity
to
have
been
born
of
a
woman
that
was
even
for
an
instant
under
the
dominion
of
satan
the
liturgies
of
the
church
being
the
established
formularies
of
her
public
worship
are
among
the
most
authoritative
documents
that
can
be
adduced
in
favor
of
any
religious
practice
in
the
liturgy
ascribed
to
james
mary
is
commemorated
as
our
most
holy
immaculate
and
most
glorious
lady
mother
of
god
and
ever
virgin
in
the
maronite
ritual
she
is
invoked
as
our
holy
praiseworthy
and
immaculate
in
the
alexandrian
liturgy
of
st
basil
she
is
addressed
as
most
holy
most
glorious
the
feast
of
mary
s
conception
commenced
to
be
celebrated
in
the
east
in
the
fifth
and
in
the
west
in
the
seventh
centuries
it
was
not
introduced
into
rome
till
probably
towards
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
though
rome
is
always
the
first
that
is
called
on
to
sanction
a
new
festival
she
is
often
the
last
to
take
part
in
it
she
is
the
first
that
is
expected
to
give
the
but
frequently
the
last
to
join
in
the
festive
song
while
she
is
silent
the
notes
are
faint
and
uncertain
when
her
voice
joins
in
the
chant
the
song
of
praise
becomes
constant
and
universal
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
add
that
the
introduction
of
the
festival
of
the
conception
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
centuries
from
the
foundation
of
christianity
no
more
implies
a
novelty
of
doctrine
than
the
erection
of
a
monument
in
to
arminius
the
german
hero
who
flourished
in
the
first
century
would
be
an
evidence
of
his
recent
exploits
the
feast
of
the
blessed
trinity
was
not
introduced
till
the
fifth
century
though
it
commemorates
a
fundamental
mystery
of
the
christian
religion
it
is
interesting
to
us
to
know
that
the
immaculate
conception
of
mary
has
been
interwoven
in
the
earliest
history
of
our
own
country
the
ship
that
first
bore
columbus
to
america
was
named
mary
of
the
conception
this
celebrated
navigator
gave
the
same
name
to
the
second
island
which
he
discovered
the
first
chapel
erected
in
quebec
when
that
city
was
founded
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
dedicated
to
god
under
the
invocation
of
mary
immaculate
in
view
of
these
three
great
prerogatives
of
divine
maternity
her
perpetual
virginity
and
her
immaculate
are
prepared
to
find
her
blessedness
often
and
expressly
declared
in
holy
scripture
the
archangel
gabriel
is
sent
to
her
from
heaven
to
announce
to
her
the
happy
tidings
that
she
was
destined
to
be
the
mother
of
the
world
s
redeemer
no
greater
favor
was
ever
before
or
since
conferred
on
woman
whether
we
consider
the
dignity
of
the
messenger
or
the
momentous
character
of
the
message
or
the
terms
of
respect
in
which
it
is
conveyed
the
angel
gabriel
was
sent
from
god
into
a
city
of
galilee
called
nazareth
to
a
virgin
and
the
virgin
s
name
was
mary
and
the
angel
being
come
in
said
unto
her
hail
full
of
grace
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
who
having
heard
was
troubled
at
his
saying
and
thought
with
herself
what
manner
of
salutation
this
should
be
and
the
angel
said
to
her
fear
not
mary
for
thou
hast
found
grace
with
god
behold
thou
shalt
conceive
in
thy
womb
and
shalt
bring
forth
a
son
and
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
the
holy
ghost
shall
come
upon
thee
and
the
power
of
the
most
high
shall
overshadow
thee
and
therefore
also
the
holy
which
shall
be
born
of
thee
shall
be
called
the
son
of
the
almighty
does
not
send
to
mary
a
prophet
or
priest
or
any
other
earthly
ambassador
nor
even
one
of
the
lower
choirs
of
angels
but
he
commissions
an
archangel
to
confer
with
her
full
of
grace
gabriel
does
not
congratulate
her
on
her
personal
charms
though
she
is
the
fairest
daughter
of
israel
he
does
not
praise
her
for
her
exalted
ancestry
though
she
is
descended
from
the
kings
of
juda
but
he
commends
her
because
she
is
the
chosen
child
of
benediction
he
admires
the
hidden
virtues
of
her
soul
brighter
than
the
sun
fairer
than
the
moon
purer
than
angels
he
sees
before
him
our
tainted
nature
s
solitary
boast
one
that
alone
escaped
the
taint
of
adam
s
disobedience
as
the
precious
diamond
reflects
various
colors
according
as
it
is
exposed
to
the
sun
s
rays
so
did
the
soul
of
mary
from
the
moment
that
the
sun
of
justice
shone
upon
her
exhibit
every
grace
that
was
prompted
by
the
occasion
stephen
and
the
apostles
were
also
said
to
be
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
by
this
however
we
are
not
to
understand
that
the
same
measure
of
grace
was
imparted
to
them
which
was
given
to
mary
on
each
one
it
is
bestowed
according
to
his
merits
and
needs
one
is
the
glory
of
the
sun
another
the
glory
of
the
moon
and
another
the
glory
of
the
stars
for
star
differeth
from
star
in
glory
and
as
mary
s
office
of
mother
of
god
immeasurably
surpassed
in
dignity
that
of
the
and
of
the
apostles
so
did
her
grace
superabound
over
theirs
lord
is
with
he
exists
in
his
creatures
in
different
ways
in
those
that
are
endowed
with
reason
in
one
way
in
irrational
creatures
in
another
his
irrational
creatures
have
no
means
of
apprehending
or
possessing
him
all
rational
creatures
may
indeed
apprehend
him
by
knowledge
but
only
the
good
by
love
only
in
the
good
does
he
so
exist
as
to
be
with
them
as
well
as
in
them
with
them
by
a
certain
harmony
and
agreement
of
will
and
in
this
way
god
is
with
all
his
saints
but
he
is
with
mary
in
a
yet
more
special
manner
for
in
her
there
was
so
great
an
agreement
and
union
with
god
that
not
her
will
only
but
her
very
flesh
was
to
be
united
to
art
thou
among
the
same
expression
is
applied
to
two
other
women
in
the
holy
to
jahel
and
judith
the
former
was
called
blessed
after
she
had
slain
sisara
and
the
latter
after
she
had
slain
holofernes
both
of
whom
had
been
enemies
of
god
s
people
in
this
respect
these
two
women
are
true
types
of
mary
who
was
chosen
by
god
to
crush
the
head
of
the
serpent
the
infernal
enemy
of
mankind
and
if
they
deserved
the
title
of
blessed
for
being
the
instruments
of
god
in
rescuing
israel
from
temporal
calamities
how
much
more
does
mary
merit
that
appellation
who
so
actively
in
the
salvation
of
the
human
race
the
evangelist
proceeds
and
mary
rising
up
in
those
days
went
into
a
city
of
juda
and
she
entered
into
the
house
of
zachary
and
saluted
elizabeth
and
it
came
to
pass
that
when
elizabeth
heard
the
salutation
of
mary
the
infant
leapt
in
her
womb
and
elizabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
she
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
said
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
and
whence
is
this
to
me
that
the
mother
of
my
lord
should
come
to
me
for
behold
as
soon
as
the
voice
of
thy
salutation
sounded
in
my
ears
the
infant
in
my
womb
leaped
for
joy
and
blessed
art
thou
that
hast
believed
because
those
things
shall
be
accomplished
that
were
spoken
to
thee
by
the
there
is
joy
in
mary
s
heart
in
being
chosen
to
become
the
mother
of
the
world
s
redeemer
she
wishes
by
her
visit
to
communicate
that
joy
to
her
cousin
the
sun
of
justice
is
shining
within
her
she
desires
to
diffuse
his
rays
through
elizabeth
s
household
she
is
laden
with
spiritual
treasures
she
must
share
them
with
her
kinswoman
especially
as
she
is
none
the
poorer
in
making
others
richer
the
usual
order
of
salutation
is
here
reversed
age
pays
reverence
to
youth
a
lady
who
is
revered
by
the
whole
community
honors
a
lowly
maiden
an
inspired
matron
expresses
her
astonishment
that
her
young
kinswoman
should
deign
to
visit
her
she
extols
mary
s
faith
and
calls
her
blessed
she
blends
the
praise
of
mary
with
the
praise
of
mary
s
son
and
even
the
infant
john
testifies
his
reverential
joy
by
leaping
in
his
mother
s
womb
and
we
are
informed
that
during
this
interview
elizabeth
was
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
to
remind
us
that
the
veneration
she
paid
to
her
cousin
was
not
prompted
by
her
own
feelings
but
was
dictated
by
the
spirit
of
god
then
mary
breaks
out
into
that
sublime
canticle
the
magnificat
my
soul
doth
magnify
the
lord
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
savior
because
he
hath
regarded
the
humility
of
his
handmaid
for
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
on
these
words
i
shall
pause
to
make
one
reflection
the
holy
ghost
through
the
organ
of
mary
s
chaste
lips
prophesies
that
all
generations
shall
call
her
blessed
with
evident
approval
of
the
praise
she
should
receive
what
a
daring
prophecy
is
this
among
the
wonderful
predictions
recorded
in
holy
scripture
i
can
recall
none
that
more
strongly
commands
my
admiration
here
is
a
modest
retiring
maiden
living
in
an
obscure
village
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
civilized
world
openly
announcing
that
every
age
till
the
end
of
time
should
pronounce
her
hallowed
we
have
no
reason
to
question
this
prophecy
for
it
is
recorded
in
the
inspired
pages
of
the
gospel
and
we
know
also
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
the
prophecy
has
been
literally
fulfilled
for
in
every
epoch
and
in
every
christian
land
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
sun
her
has
daily
resounded
now
the
catholic
is
the
only
church
whose
children
generation
after
generation
from
the
first
to
the
present
century
have
pronounced
her
blessed
of
all
christians
in
this
land
they
alone
contribute
to
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
therefore
it
is
only
catholics
that
earn
the
approval
of
heaven
by
fulfilling
the
prediction
of
the
holy
ghost
protestants
not
only
concede
that
we
bless
the
name
of
mary
but
they
even
reproach
us
with
being
too
lavish
in
our
praises
of
her
on
the
other
hand
they
are
careful
to
exclude
themselves
from
the
generations
that
were
destined
to
call
her
blessed
for
in
speaking
of
her
they
almost
invariably
withhold
from
her
the
title
of
prefering
to
call
her
or
the
or
mother
of
and
while
protestant
churches
will
resound
with
the
praises
of
sarah
and
rebecca
and
rachel
of
miriam
and
ruth
of
esther
and
judith
of
the
old
testament
and
of
elizabeth
and
anna
of
magdalen
and
martha
of
the
new
the
name
of
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
is
uttered
with
bated
breath
lest
the
sound
of
her
name
should
make
the
preacher
liable
to
the
charge
of
superstition
the
piety
of
a
mother
usually
sheds
additional
lustre
on
the
son
and
the
halo
that
encircles
her
brow
is
reflected
upon
his
the
more
the
mother
is
extolled
the
greater
honor
redounds
to
the
son
and
if
this
is
true
of
all
men
who
do
not
choose
their
mothers
how
much
more
strictly
may
it
be
affirmed
of
him
who
chose
his
own
mother
and
made
her
himself
such
as
he
would
have
her
so
that
all
the
glories
of
his
mother
are
essentially
his
own
and
yet
we
daily
see
ministers
of
the
gospel
ignoring
mary
s
exalted
virtues
and
unexampled
privileges
and
parading
her
alleged
imperfections
nay
sinfulness
as
if
her
son
were
dishonored
by
the
piety
and
took
delight
in
the
defamation
of
his
mother
such
defamers
might
learn
a
lesson
from
one
who
made
little
profession
of
christianity
is
thy
name
mary
maiden
fair
such
should
methinks
its
music
be
the
sweetest
name
that
mortals
bear
were
best
befitting
thee
and
she
to
whom
it
once
was
given
half
of
earth
and
half
of
once
more
the
title
of
is
given
to
mary
on
one
occasion
a
certain
woman
lifting
up
her
voice
said
to
jesus
blessed
is
the
womb
that
bore
thee
and
the
paps
that
gave
thee
it
is
true
that
our
lord
replied
yea
rather
or
yea
likewise
blessed
are
they
who
hear
the
word
of
god
and
keep
it
would
be
an
unwarrantable
perversion
of
the
sacred
text
to
infer
from
this
reply
that
jesus
intended
to
detract
from
the
praise
bestowed
on
his
mother
his
words
may
be
thus
correctly
paraphrased
she
is
blessed
indeed
in
being
the
chosen
instrument
of
my
incarnation
but
more
blessed
in
keeping
my
word
let
others
be
comforted
in
knowing
that
though
they
can
not
share
with
my
mother
in
the
privilege
of
her
maternity
they
can
participate
with
her
in
the
blessed
reward
of
them
who
hear
my
word
and
keep
it
in
the
preceding
passages
we
have
seen
mary
declared
blessed
on
four
different
occasions
and
hence
in
proclaiming
her
blessedness
far
from
paying
her
unmerited
honor
we
are
but
the
gospel
verdict
of
saint
and
angel
and
of
the
spirit
of
god
himself
wordsworth
though
not
nurtured
within
the
bosom
of
the
catholic
church
conceives
a
true
appreciation
of
mary
s
incomparable
holiness
in
the
following
beautiful
lines

the

is

into

foretold
that

unceasing
theme

ranks
higher
than
patriotism
and
valor
and
yet
the
admirers
of
mary
s
exalted
virtues
can
scarcely
celebrate
her
praises
without
being
accused
in
certain
quarters
of
mariolatry
when
a
nation
wishes
to
celebrate
the
memory
of
its
distinguished
men
its
admiration
is
not
confined
to
words
but
vents
itself
in
a
thousand
different
shapes
see
in
how
many
ways
we
honor
the
memory
of
washington
monuments
on
which
his
good
deeds
are
recorded
are
erected
to
his
name
the
grounds
in
which
his
remains
repose
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
are
kept
in
order
by
a
volunteer
band
of
devoted
ladies
who
adorn
the
place
with
flowers
and
this
cherished
spot
is
annually
visited
by
thousands
of
pilgrims
from
the
most
remote
sections
of
the
country
these
visitors
will
eagerly
snatch
a
flower
or
a
leaf
from
a
shrub
growing
near
washington
s
tomb
or
will
strive
even
to
clip
off
a
little
shred
from
one
of
his
garments
still
preserved
in
the
old
mansion
to
bear
home
with
them
as
precious
relics
i
have
always
observed
when
traveling
on
the
missions
up
and
down
the
potomac
that
whenever
the
steamer
came
to
the
point
opposite
mount
vernon
the
bell
was
tolled
and
every
eye
was
directed
toward
washington
s
grave
the
of
february
washington
s
birthday
is
kept
as
a
national
holiday
at
least
in
certain
portions
of
the
country
i
well
remember
that
formerly
military
and
fire
companies
paraded
the
streets
and
that
patriotic
speeches
recounting
the
heroic
deeds
of
the
first
president
were
delivered
the
festivities
of
the
day
closing
with
a
social
banquet
as
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
manifest
in
divers
ways
their
admiration
for
washington
so
do
the
citizens
of
the
republic
of
the
church
love
to
exhibit
in
corresponding
forms
their
veneration
for
the
mother
of
jesus
monuments
and
statues
are
erected
to
her
thrice
each
morn
noon
and
angelus
bells
are
rung
to
recall
to
our
mind
the
incarnation
of
our
lord
and
the
participation
of
mary
in
this
great
mystery
of
love
her
shrines
are
tastefully
adorned
by
pious
hands
and
visited
by
devoted
children
who
wear
her
relics
or
any
object
which
bears
her
image
or
which
is
associated
with
her
name
her
natal
day
and
other
days
of
the
year
sacred
to
her
memory
are
appropriately
commemorated
by
processions
by
participation
in
the
banquet
of
the
eucharist
and
by
sermons
enlarging
on
her
virtues
and
prerogatives
as
no
one
was
ever
suspected
of
loving
his
country
and
her
institutions
less
because
of
his
revering
washington
so
no
one
can
reasonably
suppose
that
our
homage
to
god
is
diminished
by
our
fostering
reverence
for
mary
as
our
object
in
eulogizing
washington
is
not
so
much
to
honor
the
man
as
to
vindicate
those
principles
of
which
he
was
the
champion
and
exponent
and
to
express
our
gratitude
to
god
for
the
blessings
bestowed
on
our
country
through
him
even
so
our
motive
in
commemorating
mary
s
name
is
not
merely
to
praise
her
but
still
more
to
keep
us
in
perpetual
remembrance
of
our
lord
s
incarnation
and
to
show
our
thankfulness
to
him
for
the
blessings
wrought
through
that
great
mystery
in
which
she
was
so
prominent
a
figure
there
is
not
a
grain
of
incense
offered
to
mary
which
does
not
ascend
to
the
throne
of
god
himself
experience
sufficiently
demonstrates
that
the
better
we
understand
the
part
which
mary
has
taken
in
the
work
of
redemption
the
more
enlightened
becomes
our
knowledge
of
our
redeemer
himself
and
that
the
greater
our
love
for
her
the
deeper
and
broader
is
our
devotion
to
him
while
experience
also
testifies
that
our
savior
s
attributes
become
more
confused
and
warped
in
the
minds
of
a
people
in
proportion
as
they
ignore
mary
s
relations
to
him
the
defender
of
a
beleaguered
citadel
concentrates
his
forces
on
the
outer
fortifications
and
towers
knowing
well
that
the
capture
of
these
outworks
would
endanger
the
citadel
itself
and
that
safety
involves
security
jesus
christ
is
the
citadel
of
our
faith
the
stronghold
of
our
soul
s
affections
mary
is
called
the
tower
of
david
and
the
gate
of
sion
which
the
lord
loveth
more
than
all
the
tabernacles
of
jacob
and
which
he
entered
at
his
incarnation
so
intimately
is
this
living
gate
of
sion
connected
with
jesus
the
temple
of
our
faith
that
no
one
has
ever
assailed
the
former
without
invading
the
latter
the
nestorian
would
have
mary
to
be
only
an
ordinary
mother
because
he
would
have
christ
to
be
a
mere
man
hence
if
we
rush
to
the
defence
of
the
gate
of
sion
it
is
because
we
are
more
zealous
for
the
city
of
god
if
we
stand
as
sentinels
around
the
tower
of
david
it
is
because
we
are
more
earnest
in
protecting
jerusalem
from
invasion
if
we
forbid
profane
hands
to
touch
the
ark
of
the
covenant
it
is
because
we
are
anxious
to
guard
from
profanation
the
lord
of
the
ark
if
we
are
so
solicitous
about
mary
s
honor
it
is
because
the
love
of
christ
presseth
us
if
we
will
not
permit
a
single
wreath
to
be
snatched
from
her
fair
brow
it
is
because
we
are
unwilling
that
a
single
feature
of
christ
s
sacred
humanity
should
be
obscured
and
because
we
wish
that
he
should
ever
shine
forth
in
all
the
splendor
of
his
glory
and
clothed
in
all
the
panoply
of
his
perfections
but
you
will
ask
why
do
you
so
often
blend
together
the
worship
of
god
and
the
veneration
of
the
blessed
virgin
why
such
exclamations
as
be
jesus
and
why
do
you
so
often
repeat
in
succession
the
lord
s
prayer
and
the
angelical
salutation
is
not
this
practice
calculated
to
level
all
distinctions
between
the
creator
and
his
creature
and
to
excite
the
displeasure
of
a
god
ever
jealous
of
his
glory
those
who
make
this
objection
should
remember
that
the
praises
of
the
lord
and
of
his
saints
are
frequently
combined
in
holy
scripture
itself
witness
judith
on
returning
from
the
tent
of
holofernes
she
sang
ye
the
lord
our
who
hath
not
forsaken
them
that
hope
in
him
by
me
his
he
hath
fulfilled
his
mercy
which
he
promised
to
the
house
of
israel
and
ozias
the
prince
of
the
people
of
israel
said
to
her
art
thou
o
by
the
lord
the
most
high
god
above
all
women
upon
the
earth
be
the
who
made
heaven
and
earth
because
he
hath
so
magnified
thy
name
this
day
that
thy
praise
shall
not
depart
out
of
the
mouth
of
witness
ecclesiasticus
after
glorifying
god
for
his
mighty
works
he
immediately
sounds
the
praises
of
enoch
and
noe
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
of
moses
and
aaron
of
samuel
and
nathan
of
david
and
josias
of
isaiah
and
jeremiah
and
other
kings
and
prophets
of
israel
elizabeth
in
the
same
breath
exclaims
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
blessed
is
the
fruit
of
thy
and
mary
herself
under
the
inspiration
of
heaven
cries
out
my
soul
magnify
the
and
my
spirit
hath
rejoiced
in
god
my
savior
for
behold
from
henceforth
all
generations
call
me
here
are
the
names
of
creator
and
creature
interwoven
like
threads
of
gold
and
silver
in
the
same
woof
without
provoking
the
jealousy
of
god
god
jealous
of
the
honor
paid
to
mary
will
a
father
be
jealous
of
the
honor
paid
to
his
child
especially
of
a
child
who
reflects
his
own
image
and
likeness
and
exhibits
those
virtues
which
he
had
inculcated
on
her
tender
mind
and
is
not
mary
god
s
child
of
predilection
will
an
architect
be
envious
of
the
praise
bestowed
on
a
magnificent
temple
which
his
genius
planned
and
reared
is
not
the
living
temple
of
mary
s
heart
the
work
of
the
supreme
architect
must
she
not
say
with
all
of
god
s
creatures
thy
hands
o
lord
have
made
me
and
formed
is
it
not
he
who
has
adorned
that
living
temple
with
those
rare
beauties
which
we
so
much
admire
has
she
not
declared
so
when
she
exclaimed
he
that
is
mighty
hath
done
great
things
to
me
and
holy
is
his
name
god
jealous
of
the
honor
paid
to
mary
as
well
might
we
imagine
that
the
sun
if
endowed
with
intelligence
would
be
jealous
of
the
mellow
golden
cloud
which
encircles
him
which
reflects
his
brightness
and
presents
in
bolder
light
his
inaccessible
splendor
as
well
imagine
that
the
same
luminary
would
be
jealous
of
our
admiration
for
the
beautiful
rose
whose
opening
petals
and
rich
color
and
delicious
fragrance
are
the
fruit
of
his
beneficent
rays
hence
in
uniting
mary
s
praise
with
that
of
jesus
we
are
strictly
imitating
the
sacred
text
we
are
imitating
joachim
the
high
priest
and
the
people
of
god
in
bethulia
who
unite
the
praises
of
judith
with
the
praises
of
jehovah
we
are
imitating
the
sacred
writer
of
ecclesiasticus
who
after
extolling
god
for
his
mighty
works
sounds
the
praises
of
enoch
and
noe
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
of
david
and
josiah
of
isaiah
and
jeremiah
and
other
kings
and
prophets
of
israel
we
are
imitating
elizabeth
who
exclaimed
in
one
breath
blessed
art
thou
mary
among
women
and
blessed
is
jesus
the
fruit
of
thy
and
as
no
one
ever
suspected
that
the
encomiums
pronounced
on
judith
and
the
virtuous
kings
and
prophets
of
israel
detracted
from
god
s
honor
so
neither
do
we
lessen
his
glory
in
exalting
the
blessed
virgin
i
find
jesus
and
mary
together
at
the
manger
together
in
egypt
together
in
nazareth
together
in
the
temple
together
at
the
cross
i
find
their
names
side
by
side
in
the
apostles
and
the
nicene
creed
it
is
fitting
that
both
should
find
a
place
in
my
heart
and
that
both
names
should
often
flow
successively
from
my
lips
inseparable
in
life
and
in
death
they
should
not
be
divorced
in
my
prayer
what
god
hath
joined
together
let
not
man
put
ii
is
it
lawful
to
invoke
her
the
church
exhorts
her
children
not
only
to
honor
the
blessed
virgin
but
also
to
invoke
her
intercession
it
is
evident
from
scripture
that
the
angels
and
saints
in
heaven
can
hear
our
prayers
and
that
they
have
the
power
and
the
will
to
help
us
now
if
the
angels
are
conversant
with
what
happens
on
earth
if
the
prophets
even
while
clothed
in
the
flesh
had
a
clear
vision
of
things
which
were
transpiring
at
a
great
distance
from
them
if
they
could
penetrate
into
the
future
and
fortell
events
which
were
then
hidden
in
the
womb
of
time
shall
we
believe
that
god
withholds
a
knowledge
of
our
prayers
from
mary
who
is
justly
styled
the
queen
of
angels
and
saints
for
as
mary
s
sanctity
surpasses
that
of
all
other
mortals
her
knowledge
must
be
proportionately
greater
than
theirs
since
knowledge
constitutes
one
of
the
sources
of
celestial
bliss
if
stephen
while
his
soul
was
still
in
the
prison
of
the
body
the
glory
of
god
and
jesus
standing
on
the
right
hand
of
god
if
paul
secret
words
spoken
in
paradise
is
it
surprising
that
mary
hears
and
sees
us
now
that
she
is
elevated
to
heaven
and
stands
face
to
face
before
god
the
perfect
mirror
of
all
knowledge
it
is
as
easy
for
god
to
enable
his
saints
to
see
things
terrestrial
from
heaven
as
things
celestial
from
earth
the
influence
of
mary
s
intercession
exceeds
that
of
the
angels
patriarchs
and
prophets
in
the
same
degree
that
her
sanctity
surpasses
theirs
if
our
heavenly
father
listens
so
propitiously
to
the
voice
of
his
servants
what
will
he
refuse
to
her
who
is
his
chosen
daughter
of
predilection
chosen
among
thousands
to
be
the
mother
of
his
beloved
son
if
we
ourselves
though
sinners
can
help
one
another
by
our
prayers
how
irresistible
must
be
the
intercession
of
mary
who
never
grieved
almighty
god
by
sin
who
never
tarnished
her
white
robe
of
innocence
by
the
least
defilement
from
the
first
moment
of
her
existence
till
she
was
received
by
triumphant
angels
into
heaven
in
speaking
of
the
patronage
of
the
blessed
virgin
we
must
never
lose
sight
of
her
title
of
mother
of
our
redeemer
nor
of
the
great
privileges
which
that
prerogative
implies
mary
was
the
mother
of
jesus
she
exercised
toward
him
all
the
influence
that
a
prudent
mother
has
over
an
affectionate
child
jesus
says
the
gospel
was
subject
to
them
is
to
mary
and
joseph
we
find
this
obedience
of
our
lord
toward
his
mother
forcibly
exemplified
at
the
marriage
feast
of
cana
her
wishes
are
delicately
expressed
in
these
words
they
have
no
he
instantly
obeys
her
by
changing
water
into
wine
though
the
time
for
exercising
his
public
ministry
and
for
working
wonders
had
not
yet
arrived
now
mary
has
never
forfeited
in
heaven
the
title
of
mother
of
jesus
she
is
still
his
mother
and
while
adoring
him
as
her
god
she
still
retains
her
maternal
relations
and
he
exercises
toward
her
that
loving
willingness
to
grant
her
request
which
the
best
of
sons
entertains
for
the
best
of
mothers
never
does
jesus
appear
to
us
so
amiable
and
endearing
as
when
we
see
him
nestled
in
the
arms
of
his
mother
we
love
to
contemplate
him
and
artists
love
to
represent
him
in
that
situation
it
appears
to
me
that
had
we
lived
in
jerusalem
in
his
day
and
recognized
like
simeon
the
lord
of
majesty
in
the
form
of
an
infant
and
had
we
a
favor
to
ask
him
we
would
present
it
through
mary
s
hands
while
the
divine
eyes
of
the
babe
were
gazing
on
her
sweet
countenance
and
even
so
now
never
will
our
prayers
find
a
readier
acceptance
than
when
offered
through
her
in
invoking
our
lady
s
patronage
we
are
actuated
by
a
triple
sense
of
the
majesty
of
god
our
own
unworthiness
and
of
mary
s
incomparable
influence
with
her
heavenly
father
conscious
of
our
natural
lowliness
and
sins
we
have
frequent
recourse
to
her
intercession
in
the
assured
hope
of
being
more
favorably
heard
and
even
as
children
who
have
much
offended
a
too
indulgent
father
in
great
shame
penitent
and
yet
not
daring
unattended
to
go
into
his
presence
at
the
gate
speak
to
their
sister
and
confiding
wait
till
she
goes
in
before
and
intercedes
so
men
repenting
of
their
evil
deeds
and
yet
not
venturing
rashly
to
draw
near
with
their
requests
an
angry
father
s
ear
offer
to
her
their
prayers
and
their
confession
and
she
in
heaven
for
them
makes
do
you
ask
me
is
mary
willing
to
assist
you
does
she
really
take
an
interest
in
your
welfare
or
is
she
so
much
absorbed
by
the
fruition
of
god
as
to
be
indifferent
to
our
miseries
can
a
woman
forget
her
infant
so
as
not
to
have
pity
on
the
fruit
of
her
womb
even
so
mary
will
not
forget
us
the
love
she
bears
us
her
children
by
adoption
can
be
estimated
only
by
her
love
for
her
son
by
nature
it
was
mary
that
nursed
the
infant
savior
it
was
her
hands
that
clothed
him
it
was
her
breast
that
sheltered
him
from
the
rude
storm
and
from
the
persecution
of
herod
she
it
was
that
wiped
the
stains
from
his
brow
when
taken
down
from
the
cross
now
we
are
the
brothers
of
jesus
he
is
not
ashamed
says
the
apostle
to
call
us
his
brethren
neither
is
mary
ashamed
to
call
us
her
children
by
adoption
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
she
adopted
us
in
the
person
of
john
she
is
anxious
to
minister
to
our
souls
as
she
ministered
to
the
corporal
wants
of
her
son
she
would
be
the
instrument
of
god
in
feeding
us
with
divine
grace
in
clothing
us
with
the
garments
of
innocence
in
sheltering
us
from
the
storms
of
temptations
in
wiping
away
the
stains
of
sin
from
our
soul
if
the
angels
though
of
a
different
nature
from
ours
have
so
much
sympathy
for
us
as
to
rejoice
in
our
conversion
how
great
must
be
the
interest
manifested
toward
us
by
mary
who
is
of
a
common
nature
with
us
descended
from
the
same
primitive
parents
being
bone
of
our
bone
and
flesh
of
our
flesh
and
who
once
trod
the
thorny
path
of
life
that
we
now
tread
though
not
of
the
household
of
the
faith
edgar
poe
did
not
disdain
to
invoke
our
lady
s
intercession
and
to
acknowledge
the
influence
of
her
patronage
in
heaven
at
twilight
maria
thou
hast
heard
my
hymn
in
joy
and
good
and
mother
of
god
be
with
me
still
when
the
hours
flew
brightly
by
and
not
a
cloud
obscured
the
sky
my
soul
lest
it
should
truant
be
thy
grace
did
guide
to
thine
and
thee
now
when
storms
of
fate
o
ercast
darkly
my
present
and
my
past
let
my
future
radiant
shine
with
sweet
hopes
of
thee
and
some
persons
not
only
object
to
the
invocation
of
mary
as
being
unprofitable
but
they
even
affect
to
be
scandalized
at
the
confidence
we
repose
in
her
intercession
on
the
groundless
assumption
that
by
praying
to
her
we
ignore
and
dishonor
god
and
that
we
put
the
creature
on
a
level
with
the
creator
every
catholic
child
knows
from
the
catechism
that
to
give
to
any
creature
the
supreme
honor
due
to
god
alone
is
idolatry
how
can
we
be
said
to
dishonor
god
or
bring
him
down
to
a
level
with
his
creature
by
invoking
mary
since
we
acknowledge
her
to
be
a
pure
creature
indebted
like
ourselves
to
him
for
every
gift
and
influence
that
she
possesses
this
is
implied
in
the
very
form
of
our
petitions
when
we
address
our
prayers
to
her
we
say
for
us
implying
by
these
words
that
she
herself
is
a
petitioner
at
the
throne
of
divine
mercy
to
god
we
say
us
our
daily
thereby
acknowledging
him
to
be
the
source
of
all
bounty
this
principle
being
kept
in
view
how
can
we
be
justly
accused
of
slighting
god
s
majesty
by
invoking
the
intercession
of
his
handmaid
if
a
beggar
asks
and
receives
alms
from
me
through
my
servant
should
i
be
offended
at
the
blessings
which
he
invokes
upon
her
far
from
it
i
accept
them
as
intended
for
myself
because
she
bestowed
what
was
mine
and
with
my
consent
our
lord
says
to
his
apostles
i
dispose
to
you
a
kingdom
that
you
may
eat
and
drink
at
my
table
in
my
kingdom
and
may
sit
upon
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
paul
says
know
you
not
that
we
shall
judge
angels
how
much
more
things
of
this
world
if
the
apostles
may
sit
at
the
table
of
the
lord
in
heaven
without
prejudice
to
his
majesty
surely
our
lady
can
stand
as
an
advocate
before
him
without
infringing
on
his
rights
if
they
can
exercise
the
dread
prerogative
of
judges
of
angels
and
of
men
without
trespassing
on
the
divine
judgeship
of
jesus
surely
mary
can
fulfill
the
more
modest
function
of
intercessor
with
her
son
without
intruding
on
his
supreme
mediatorship
for
higher
is
the
office
of
judge
than
that
of
advocate
and
yet
while
no
one
is
ever
startled
at
the
power
given
to
the
apostles
many
are
impatient
of
the
lesser
privilege
claimed
for
mary
iii
is
it
lawful
to
imitate
her
as
a
model
but
while
the
exalted
privileges
of
mary
render
her
worthy
of
our
veneration
while
her
saintly
influence
renders
her
worthy
of
our
invocation
her
personal
life
is
constantly
held
up
to
us
as
a
pattern
worthy
of
our
imitation
if
she
occupies
so
prominent
a
place
in
our
pulpits
this
prominence
is
less
due
to
her
prerogatives
as
a
mother
or
to
her
intercession
as
a
patroness
than
to
her
example
as
a
saint
after
our
lord
jesus
christ
no
one
has
ever
exercised
so
salutary
and
so
dominant
an
influence
as
the
blessed
virgin
on
society
on
the
family
and
on
the
individual
the
mother
of
jesus
exercises
throughout
the
christian
commonwealth
that
hallowing
influence
which
a
good
mother
wields
over
the
christian
family
what
temple
or
chapel
how
rude
soever
it
may
be
is
not
adorned
with
a
painting
or
a
statue
of
the
madonna
what
house
is
not
embellished
with
an
image
of
mary
what
catholic
child
is
a
stranger
to
her
familiar
face
the
priest
and
the
layman
the
scholar
and
the
illiterate
the
prince
and
the
peasant
the
mother
and
the
maid
acknowledge
her
benign
sway
and
if
christianity
is
so
fruitful
in
comparison
with
paganism
in
conjugal
fidelity
in
female
purity
and
in
the
respect
paid
to
womanhood
these
blessings
are
in
no
small
measure
due
to
the
force
of
mary
s
influence
and
example
ever
since
the
son
of
god
chose
a
woman
to
be
his
mother
man
looks
up
to
woman
with
a
homage
akin
to
veneration
the
poet
longfellow
pays
the
following
tribute
to
mary
s
sanctifying
influence
this
is
indeed
the
blessed
mary
s
land
virgin
and
mother
of
our
dear
redeemer
all
hearts
are
touched
and
softened
at
her
name

the

the

and

the
man

the
visionary

pay
homage
to
her
as
one
ever

and
if
our

had
given
us
nothing
more
than
this
example
of
all
womanhood
so
mild
so
merciful
so
strong
so
good
so
patient
peaceful
loyal
loving
pure
this
were
enough
to
prove
it
higher
and
truer
than
all
the
creeds
the
world
had
known
ambrose
gives
us
the
following
beautiful
picture
of
mary
s
life
before
her
espousals
let
the
life
he
says
of
the
blessed
mary
be
ever
present
to
you
in
which
as
in
a
mirror
the
beauty
of
chastity
and
the
form
of
virtue
shine
forth
she
was
a
virgin
not
only
in
body
but
in
mind
who
never
sullied
the
pure
affection
of
her
heart
by
unworthy
feelings
she
was
humble
of
heart
serious
in
her
conversation
fonder
of
reading
than
of
speaking
she
placed
her
confidence
rather
in
the
prayer
of
the
poor
than
in
the
uncertain
riches
of
this
world
she
was
ever
intent
on
her
occupation
and
accustomed
to
make
god
rather
than
man
the
witness
of
her
thoughts
she
injured
no
one
wished
well
to
all
reverenced
age
yielded
not
to
envy
avoided
all
boasting
followed
the
dictates
of
reason
and
loved
virtue
when
did
she
sadden
her
parents
even
by
a
look
there
was
nothing
forward
in
her
looks
bold
in
her
words
or
unbecoming
in
her
actions
her
carriage
was
not
abrupt
her
gait
not
indolent
her
voice
not
petulant
so
that
her
very
appearance
was
the
picture
of
her
mind
and
the
figure
of
her
life
as
a
spouse
and
as
a
mother
was
a
counterpart
of
her
earlier
years
the
gospel
relates
one
little
circumstance
which
amply
suffices
to
demonstrate
mary
s
holiness
of
life
and
to
exhibit
her
as
a
beautiful
pattern
to
those
who
are
called
to
rule
a
household
the
evangelist
tells
us
that
jesus
was
subject
to
them
is
to
mary
and
joseph
he
obeyed
all
her
commands
fulfilled
her
behests
complied
with
her
smallest
injunctions
in
a
word
he
discharged
toward
her
all
the
filial
observances
which
a
dutiful
son
exercises
toward
a
prudent
mother
these
relations
continued
from
his
childhood
to
his
public
life
nor
did
they
cease
even
then
now
jesus
being
the
son
of
god
the
brightness
of
his
glory
and
the
figure
of
his
substance
could
not
sin
he
was
incapable
of
fulfilling
an
unrighteous
precept
the
obvious
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
these
facts
is
that
mary
never
sinned
by
commanding
as
jesus
could
not
sin
by
obeying
that
all
her
precepts
and
counsels
were
stamped
with
the
seal
of
divine
approbation
and
that
the
son
never
fulfilled
any
injunction
of
his
earthly
mother
which
was
not
ratified
by
his
eternal
father
in
heaven
such
is
the
beautiful
portrait
which
the
church
holds
up
to
the
contemplation
of
her
children
that
studying
it
they
may
admire
the
original
admiring
they
may
love
loving
they
may
imitate
and
thus
become
more
dear
to
god
by
being
made
conformable
to
the
image
of
his
son
of
whom
mary
is
the
most
perfect
mirror
chapter
xv
sacred
images
the
veneration
of
the
images
of
christ
and
his
saints
is
a
cherished
devotion
in
the
catholic
church
and
this
practice
will
be
vindicated
in
the
following
lines
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
making
of
holy
images
was
not
so
general
among
the
jews
as
it
is
among
us
because
the
hebrews
themselves
were
prone
to
idolatry
and
because
they
were
surrounded
by
idolatrous
people
who
might
misconstrue
the
purpose
for
which
the
images
were
intended
for
the
same
prudential
reasons
the
primitive
christians
were
very
cautious
in
making
images
and
very
circumspect
in
exposing
them
to
the
gaze
of
the
heathen
among
whom
they
lived
lest
christian
images
should
be
confounded
with
pagan
idols
the
catacombs
of
rome
to
which
the
faithful
alone
were
admitted
abounded
however
in
sacred
emblems
and
pious
representations
which
are
preserved
even
to
this
day
and
attest
the
practice
of
the
early
christian
church
we
see
there
painted
on
the
walls
or
on
vases
of
glass
the
dove
the
emblem
of
the
holy
ghost
christ
carrying
his
cross
or
bearing
on
his
shoulders
the
lost
sheep
we
meet
also
the
lamb
an
anchor
and
a
types
of
our
lord
of
hope
and
of
the
church
the
first
crusade
against
images
was
waged
in
the
eighth
century
by
leo
the
isaurian
emperor
of
constantinople
he
commanded
the
paintings
of
our
lord
and
his
saints
to
be
torn
down
from
the
church
walls
and
burned
he
even
invaded
the
sanctuary
of
home
and
snatched
thence
the
sacred
emblems
which
adorned
private
residences
he
caused
statues
of
bronze
silver
and
gold
to
be
melted
down
and
conveniently
converted
them
into
coins
upon
which
his
own
image
was
stamped
like
henry
viii
and
cromwell
this
royal
iconoclast
affected
to
be
moved
by
a
zeal
for
purity
of
worship
while
avarice
was
the
real
motive
of
his
action
the
emperor
commanded
the
learned
librarians
of
his
imperial
library
to
give
public
approbation
to
his
decrees
against
images
and
when
those
conscientious
men
refused
to
endorse
his
course
they
were
all
confined
in
the
imperial
library
the
building
was
set
on
fire
and
thirty
thousand
volumes
the
splendid
basilica
which
contained
them
innumerable
paintings
and
the
librarians
themselves
were
involved
in
one
common
destruction
constantine
copronymus
prosecuted
the
vandalism
of
leo
his
predecessor
stephen
an
intrepid
monk
presented
to
the
emperor
a
coin
bearing
that
tyrant
s
effigy
with
these
words
sire
whose
image
is
this
it
is
mine
replied
the
emperor
the
monk
then
threw
down
the
piece
of
money
and
trampled
it
he
was
instantly
seized
by
the
imperial
attendants
and
soon
after
put
to
a
painful
death
alas
cried
the
holy
man
to
the
emperor
if
i
am
punished
for
dishonoring
the
image
of
a
mortal
monarch
what
punishment
do
they
deserve
who
burn
the
image
of
jesus
christ
the
demolition
of
images
was
revived
by
the
reformers
of
the
sixteenth
century
paintings
and
statues
were
ruthlessly
destroyed
chiefly
in
the
british
isles
germany
and
holland
under
the
pretext
that
the
making
of
them
was
idolatrous
but
as
the
iconoclasts
of
the
eighth
century
had
no
scruple
about
appropriating
to
their
own
use
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
statues
which
they
melted
neither
had
the
iconoclasts
of
the
sixteenth
century
any
hesitation
in
confiscating
and
worshiping
in
the
idolatrous
churches
whose
statues
and
paintings
they
broke
and
disfigured
a
stranger
who
visits
some
of
the
desecrated
catholic
churches
of
great
britain
and
the
continent
which
are
now
used
as
protestant
temples
can
not
fail
to
notice
the
mutilated
statues
of
the
saints
still
standing
in
their
niches
this
barbaric
warfare
against
religious
memorials
was
not
only
a
grievous
sacrilege
but
an
outrage
against
the
fine
arts
and
had
the
destroying
angels
extended
their
ravages
over
europe
the
immortal
works
of
michael
angelo
and
raphael
would
be
lost
to
us
today
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
regarding
the
use
of
sacred
images
is
clearly
and
fully
expressed
by
the
general
council
of
trent
in
the
following
words
the
images
of
christ
and
of
his
virgin
mother
and
of
other
saints
are
to
be
had
and
retained
especially
in
churches
and
a
due
honor
and
veneration
is
to
be
given
to
them
not
that
any
divinity
or
virtue
is
believed
to
be
in
them
for
which
they
are
to
be
honored
or
that
any
prayer
is
to
be
made
to
them
or
that
any
confidence
is
to
be
placed
in
them
as
was
formerly
done
by
the
heathens
who
placed
their
hopes
in
idols
but
because
the
honor
which
is
given
them
is
referred
to
the
originals
which
they
represent
so
that
by
the
images
which
we
kiss
and
before
which
we
uncover
our
heads
or
kneel
we
adore
christ
and
venerate
his
saints
whose
likeness
they
every
catholic
child
clearly
comprehends
the
essential
difference
which
exists
between
a
pagan
idol
and
a
christian
image
the
pagans
looked
upon
an
idol
as
a
god
endowed
with
intelligence
and
the
other
attributes
of
the
deity
they
were
therefore
idolaters
or
catholic
christians
know
that
a
holy
image
has
no
intelligence
or
power
to
hear
and
help
them
they
pay
it
a
relative
is
their
reverence
for
the
copy
is
proportioned
to
the
veneration
which
they
entertain
for
the
heavenly
original
to
which
it
is
also
referred
for
the
sake
of
my
protestant
readers
i
may
here
quote
their
own
great
leibnitz
on
the
reverence
paid
to
sacred
images
he
says
in
his
though
we
speak
of
the
honor
paid
to
images
yet
this
is
only
a
manner
of
speaking
which
really
means
that
we
honor
not
the
senseless
thing
which
is
incapable
of
understanding
such
honor
but
the
prototype
which
receives
honor
through
its
representation
according
to
the
teaching
of
the
council
of
trent
it
is
in
this
sense
i
take
it
that
scholastic
writers
have
spoken
of
the
same
worship
being
paid
to
images
of
christ
as
to
christ
our
lord
himself
for
the
act
which
is
called
the
worship
of
an
image
is
really
the
worship
of
christ
himself
through
and
in
the
presence
of
the
image
and
by
occasion
of
it
by
the
inclination
of
the
body
toward
it
as
to
christ
himself
as
rendering
him
more
manifestly
present
and
raising
the
mind
more
actively
to
the
contemplation
of
him
certainly
no
sane
man
thinks
under
such
circumstances
of
praying
in
this
wise
give
me
o
image
what
i
ask
to
thee
o
marble
or
wood
i
give
thanks
but
thee
o
lord
i
adore
to
thee
i
give
thanks
and
sing
songs
of
given
then
that
there
is
no
other
veneration
of
images
than
that
which
means
veneration
of
their
prototype
there
is
surely
no
more
idolatry
in
it
than
there
is
in
the
respect
shown
in
the
utterance
of
the
most
holy
names
of
god
and
christ
for
after
all
names
are
but
signs
or
symbols
and
even
as
such
inferior
to
images
for
they
represent
much
less
vividly
so
that
when
there
is
question
of
honoring
images
this
is
to
be
understood
in
the
same
way
as
when
it
is
said
that
at
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
shall
bend
or
that
the
name
of
the
lord
is
blessed
or
that
glory
be
given
to
his
name
thus
the
bowing
before
an
image
outside
of
us
is
no
more
to
be
reprehended
than
the
worshiping
before
an
external
image
in
our
own
minds
for
the
external
image
does
but
serve
the
purpose
of
expressing
visibly
that
which
is
in
the
book
of
exodus
we
read
thou
shalt
not
make
to
thyself
a
graven
thing
nor
the
likeness
of
anything
that
is
in
heaven

protestants
contend
that
these
words
contain
an
absolute
prohibition
against
the
making
of
images
while
the
catholic
church
insists
that
the
commandment
referred
to
merely
prohibits
us
from
worshiping
them
as
gods
the
text
can
not
mean
the
absolute
prohibition
of
making
images
for
in
that
case
god
would
contradict
himself
by
commanding
in
one
part
of
scripture
what
he
condemns
in
another
in
exodus
xxv
for
instance
he
commands
two
cherubim
of
beaten
gold
to
be
made
and
placed
on
each
side
of
the
oracle
and
in
numbers
xxi
he
commands
moses
to
make
a
brazen
serpent
and
to
set
it
up
for
a
sign
that
whosoever
being
struck
by
the
fiery
serpents
shall
look
upon
it
shall
are
not
cherubim
and
serpents
the
likenesses
of
creatures
in

in

beneath
and
in
the
waters
under

for
cherubim
dwell
in

and
serpents
are
found
on
land
and
sea
we
should
all
without
exception
break
the
commandment
were
we
to
take
it
in
the
protestant
sense
have
you
not
at
home
the
portraits
of
living
and
departed
relatives

are
not
these
the
likenesses
of
persons
in

beneath
westminster
abbey
though
once
a
catholic
cathedral
is
now
a
protestant
house
of
worship
it
is
filled
with
the
statues
of
illustrious
men
yet
no
one
will
accuse
the
english
church
of
idolatry
in
allowing
those
statues
to
remain
there
but
you
will
say
the
worshipers
in
westminster
have
no
intention
of
adoring
these
statues
neither
have
we
any
intention
of
worshiping
the
statues
of
the
saints
an
english
parson
once
remarked
to
a
catholic
friend
tom
don
t
you
pray
to
images
we
pray
before
them
replied
tom
but
we
have
no
intention
of
praying
to
who
cares
for
your
intention
retorted
the
parson
don
t
you
pray
at
night
observed
tom
yes
said
the
parson
i
pray
at
my
yes
you
pray
to
the
oh
no
said
the
reverend
gentleman
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
who
cares
replied
tom
for
your
the
moral
rectitude
or
depravity
of
our
actions
can
not
be
determined
without
taking
into
account
the
intention
there
are
many
persons
who
have
been
taught
in
the
nursery
tales
that
catholics
worship
idols
these
persons
if
they
visit
europe
and
see
an
old
man
praying
before
an
image
of
our
lord
or
a
madonna
which
is
placed
along
the
wayside
are
at
once
confirmed
in
their
prejudices
their
zeal
against
idols
takes
fire
and
they
write
home
adding
one
more
proof
of
idolatry
against
the
benighted
romanists
if
these
superficial
travelers
had
only
the
patience
to
question
the
old
man
he
would
tell
them
with
simplicity
of
faith
that
the
statue
had
no
life
to
hear
or
help
him
but
that
its
contemplation
inspired
him
with
greater
reverence
for
the
original
as
i
am
writing
for
the
information
of
protestants
i
quote
with
pleasure
the
following
passage
written
by
one
of
their
own
theologians
in
the
edit
d
yverdun
tom
art
when
lot
prostrates
himself
before
the
two
angels
it
is
an
act
of
courtesy
towards
honored
guests
when
jacob
bows
down
before
esau
it
is
an
act
of
deference
from
a
younger
to
an
elder
brother
when
solomon
bows
low
before
bethsabee
it
is
the
honor
which
a
son
pays
to
his
mother
when
nathan
coming
in
before
david
had
worshiped
bowing
down
to
the
ground
it
is
the
homage
of
a
subject
to
his
prince
but
when
a
man
prostrates
himself
in
prayer
to
god
it
is
the
creature
adoring
the
creator
and
if
these
various
actions
are
by
the
word
sometimes
by
or
is
not
the
bare
meaning
of
the
word
which
has
guided
interpreters
in
rendering
it
but
the
nature
of
the
case
when
an
israelite
prostrated
himself
before
the
king
no
one
thought
of
charging
him
with
idolatry
if
he
had
done
the
same
thing
in
the
presence
of
an
idol
the
very
same
bodily
act
would
have
been
called
idolatry
and
why
because
all
men
would
have
judged
by
his
action
that
he
regarded
the
idol
as
a
real
divinity
and
that
he
would
express
in
respect
to
it
the
sentiments
manifested
by
adoration
in
the
limited
sense
which
we
give
to
the
word
what
shall
we
think
then
of
what
catholics
do
to
show
honor
to
saints
to
relics
to
the
wood
of
the
cross
they
will
not
deny
that
their
acts
of
reverence
in
such
cases
are
very
much
like
those
by
which
they
pay
outward
honor
to
god
but
have
they
the
same
ideas
about
the
saints
the
relics
and
the
cross
as
they
have
about
god
i
believe
that
we
can
not
fairly
accuse
them
of
a
gentleman
who
was
present
at
the
unveiling
of
clay
s
statue
in
the
city
of
richmond
informed
me
that
as
soon
as
the
curtain
was
uplifted
and
the
noble
form
of
the
kentucky
statesman
appeared
in
full
view
the
immense
concourse
of
spectators
instinctively
uncovered
their
heads
why
do
you
take
off
your
hat
playfully
remarked
my
friend
to
an
acquaintance
who
stood
by
in
honor
of
course
of
henry
clay
he
replied
but
henry
is
not
there
in
the
flesh
you
see
nothing
but
but
my
intention
sir
he
continued
is
to
do
honor
to
the
he
answered
correctly
and
yet
how
many
of
the
same
people
would
be
shocked
if
they
saw
a
man
take
off
his
hat
in
the
presence
of
a
statue
of
peter
it
is
not
therefore
the
making
of
the
image
but
its
worship
that
is
condemned
by
the
decalogue
having
seen
the
lawfulness
of
sacred
images
let
us
now
consider
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
their
use
paintings
embellish
the
house
of
what
is
more
becoming
than
to
adorn
the
church
which
is
the
shadow
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
so
beautifully
described
by
st
john
solomon
decorated
the
temple
of
god
with
images
of
cherubim
and
other
representations
and
he
overlaid
the
cherubim
with
gold
and
all
the
walls
of
the
temple
round
about
he
carved
with
divers
figures
and
if
it
was
meet
and
proper
to
adorn
solomon
s
temple
which
contained
only
the
ark
of
the
lord
how
much
more
fitting
is
it
to
decorate
our
churches
which
contain
the
lord
of
the
ark
when
i
see
a
church
tastefully
ornamented
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
master
is
at
home
and
that
his
devoted
subjects
pay
homage
to
him
in
his
court
what
beauty
what
variety
what
charming
pictures
are
presented
to
our
view
in
this
temple
of
nature
which
we
inhabit
look
at
the
canopy
of
heaven
look
at
the
exquisite
pictures
painted
by
the
hand
of
the
divine
artist
on
this
earth
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
i
say
to
you
that
not
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
arrayed
as
one
of
if
the
temple
of
nature
is
so
richly
adorned
should
not
our
temples
made
with
hands
bear
some
resemblance
to
it
how
many
professing
christians
must
like
david
reproach
themselves
for
dwelling
in
a
house
of
cedar
while
the
ark
of
god
is
lodged
with
how
many
are
there
whose
private
apartments
are
adorned
with
exquisite
paintings
who
affect
to
be
scandalized
at
the
sight
of
a
single
pious
emblem
in
their
house
of
worship
on
the
occasion
of
the
celebration
of
henry
beecher
s
silver
wedding
several
wealthy
members
of
his
congregation
adorned
the
walls
of
plymouth
church
with
their
private
paintings
their
object
of
course
in
doing
so
was
not
to
honor
god
but
their
pastor
but
if
the
portraits
of
men
were
no
desecration
to
that
church
how
can
the
portraits
of
saints
desecrate
ours
and
what
can
be
more
appropriate
than
to
surround
the
sanctuary
of
jesus
christ
with
the
portraits
of
the
saints
especially
of
mary
and
of
the
apostles
who
in
their
life
ministered
to
his
sacred
person
and
is
it
not
natural
for
children
to
adorn
their
homes
with
the
likenesses
of
their
fathers
in
the
faith
paintings
are
the
catechism
of
the
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
church
and
state
in
the
cause
of
education
a
great
proportion
of
the
human
race
will
be
found
illiterate
descriptive
pictures
will
teach
those
what
books
make
known
to
the
learned
how
many
thousands
would
have
died
ignorant
of
the
christian
faith
if
they
had
not
been
enlightened
by
paintings
when
augustine
the
apostle
of
england
first
appeared
before
king
ethelbert
to
announce
to
him
the
gospel
a
silver
crucifix
and
a
painting
of
our
savior
were
borne
before
the
preacher
and
these
images
spoke
more
tenderly
to
the
eyes
than
his
words
to
the
ears
of
his
audience
by
means
of
religious
emblems
francis
xavier
effected
many
conversions
in
india
and
by
the
same
means
father
de
smet
made
known
the
gospel
to
the
savages
of
the
rocky
mountains
exhibiting
religious
paintings
in
our
rooms
make
a
silent
though
eloquent
profession
of
our
i
once
called
on
a
gentleman
in
a
distant
city
some
time
during
our
late
war
and
on
entering
his
library
i
noticed
two
portraits
one
of
a
distinguished
general
the
other
of
an
archbishop
these
portraits
at
once
proclaimed
to
me
the
religious
and
patriotic
sentiments
of
the
proprietor
of
the
house
behold
he
said
to
me
pointing
to
the
pictures
my
religious
creed
and
my
political
if
i
see
a
crucifix
in
a
man
s
room
i
am
convinced
at
once
that
he
is
not
an
infidel
the
aid
of
sacred
pictures
devotion
and
love
for
the
original
are
intensified
because
we
can
concentrate
our
thoughts
more
intently
on
the
object
of
our
mark
how
the
eye
of
a
tender
child
glistens
on
confronting
the
painting
of
an
affectionate
mother
what
christian
can
stand
unmoved
when
contemplating
a
picture
of
the
mother
of
sorrows
how
much
devotion
has
been
fostered
by
the
stations
of
the
cross
observe
the
intense
sympathy
depicted
on
the
face
of
the
humble
christian
woman
as
she
silently
passes
from
one
station
to
another
she
follows
her
savior
step
by
step
from
the
garden
to
mount
calvary
the
whole
scene
like
a
panoramic
view
is
imprinted
on
her
mind
her
memory
and
her
affections
never
did
the
most
pathetic
sermon
on
the
passion
enkindle
such
heartfelt
love
or
evoke
such
salutary
resolutions
as
have
been
produced
by
the
silent
spectacle
of
our
savior
hanging
on
the
cross
portraits
of
the
saints
stimulate
us
to
the
of
their
and
this
is
the
principal
aim
which
the
church
has
in
view
in
encouraging
the
use
of
pious
representations
one
object
it
is
true
is
to
honor
the
saints
another
is
to
invoke
them
but
the
principal
end
is
to
incite
us
to
an
imitation
of
their
holy
lives
we
are
exhorted
to
look
and
do
according
to
the
pattern
shown
us
on
the
nor
do
i
know
a
better
means
for
promoting
piety
than
by
example
if
you
keep
at
home
the
likenesses
of
george
washington
of
patrick
henry
of
chief
justice
taney
or
of
other
distinguished
men
the
copies
of
such
eminent
originals
can
not
fail
to
exercise
a
salutary
though
silent
influence
on
the
mind
and
heart
of
your
child
your
son
will
ask
you
who
are
those
men
and
when
you
tell
him
this
is
washington
the
father
of
his
country
this
is
patrick
henry
the
ardent
lover
of
civil
liberty
and
this
is
taney
the
incorruptible
judge
your
boy
will
imperceptibly
imbibe
not
only
a
veneration
for
those
men
but
a
relish
for
the
civic
virtues
for
which
they
were
conspicuous
and
in
like
manner
when
our
children
have
constantly
before
their
eyes
the
purest
and
most
exalted
models
of
sanctity
they
can
not
fail
to
draw
from
such
contemplation
a
taste
for
the
virtues
that
marked
the
lives
of
the
originals
is
not
our
country
flooded
with
obscene
pictures
and
immodest
representations
which
corrupt
our
youths
if
the
agents
of
satan
employ
means
so
vile
for
a
bad
end
if
they
are
cunning
enough
to
pour
through
the
senses
into
the
hearts
of
the
unwary
the
insidious
poison
of
sin
by
placing
before
them
lascivious
portraits
in
god
s
name
why
should
not
we
sanctify
the
souls
of
our
children
by
means
of
pious
emblems
why
should
not
we
make
the
eye
the
instrument
of
edification
as
the
enemy
makes
it
the
organ
of
destruction
shall
the
pen
of
the
artist
the
pencil
of
the
painter
and
the
chisel
of
the
sculptor
be
prostituted
to
the
basest
purposes
god
forbid
the
arts
were
intended
to
be
the
handmaids
of
religion
almost
every
moment
of
the
day
the
eye
is
receiving
impressions
from
outward
objects
and
instantly
communicating
these
impressions
to
the
soul
thus
the
soul
receives
every
day
thousands
of
impressions
good
or
bad
according
to
the
character
of
the
objects
presented
to
its
gaze
we
can
not
therefore
the
salutary
effect
produced
upon
us
in
a
church
or
room
adorned
with
sacred
paintings
we
feel
while
in
their
presence
that
we
are
in
the
company
of
the
just
the
contemplation
of
these
pious
portraits
chastens
our
affections
elevates
our
thoughts
checks
our
levity
and
diffuses
around
us
a
healthy
atmosphere
i
am
happy
to
acknowledge
that
the
outcry
formerly
raised
against
images
has
almost
subsided
of
late
the
epithet
of
is
seldom
applied
to
us
now
even
some
of
our
dissenting
brethren
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
utility
of
religious
symbols
and
to
regret
that
we
have
been
permitted
by
the
intemperate
zeal
of
the
reformers
to
have
so
long
the
monopoly
of
them
crosses
already
surmount
some
of
our
protestant
churches
and
replace
the
a
gentleman
of
richmond
recently
informed
me
that
during
the
preceding
holy
week
he
adorned
with
twelve
crosses
an
episcopal
church
in
which
eleven
years
before
the
sight
of
a
single
one
was
viewed
with
horror
by
the
minister
may
the
day
soon
come
when
all
christians
will
join
with
us
not
only
in
venerating
the
sacred
symbol
of
salvation
but
in
worshiping
at
the
same
altar
chapter
xvi
purgatory
and
prayers
for
the
dead
the
catholic
church
teaches
that
besides
a
place
of
eternal
torments
for
the
wicked
and
of
everlasting
rest
for
the
righteous
there
exists
in
the
next
life
a
middle
state
of
temporary
punishment
allotted
for
those
who
have
died
in
venial
sin
or
who
have
not
satisfied
the
justice
of
god
for
sins
already
forgiven
she
also
teaches
us
that
although
the
souls
consigned
to
this
intermediate
state
commonly
called
purgatory
can
not
help
themselves
they
may
be
aided
by
the
suffrages
of
the
faithful
on
earth
the
existence
of
purgatory
naturally
implies
the
correlative
utility
of
praying
for
the
the
souls
consigned
to
this
middle
state
have
not
reached
the
term
of
their
journey
they
are
still
exiles
from
heaven
and
fit
subjects
for
divine
clemency
the
doctrine
of
an
intermediate
state
is
thus
succinctly
asserted
by
the
council
of
trent
there
is
a
purgatory
and
souls
there
detained
are
helped
by
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
and
especially
by
the
acceptable
sacrifice
of
the
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
council
studiously
abstains
from
specifying
the
nature
of
the
expiating
sufferings
endured
therein
is
it
not
strange
that
this
cherished
doctrine
should
also
be
called
in
question
by
the
leveling
innovators
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
we
consider
that
it
is
clearly
taught
in
the
old
testament
that
it
is
at
least
insinuated
in
the
new
testament
that
it
is
unanimously
proclaimed
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
that
it
is
embodied
in
all
the
ancient
liturgies
of
the
oriental
and
the
western
church
and
that
it
is
a
doctrine
alike
consonant
with
our
reason
and
eminently
consoling
to
the
human
heart
is
a
doctrine
plainly
contained
in
the
old
testament
and
piously
practiced
by
the
hebrew
people
at
the
close
of
an
engagement
which
judas
machabeus
had
with
the
enemy
he
ordered
prayers
and
sacrifices
to
be
offered
up
for
his
slain
comrades
and
making
a
gathering
he
sent
twelve
thousand
drachms
of
silver
to
jerusalem
for
sacrifice
to
be
offered
for
the
sins
of
the
dead
thinking
well
and
religiously
concerning
the
resurrection
for
if
he
had
not
hoped
that
they
that
were
slain
should
rise
again
it
would
have
seemed
superfluous
and
vain
to
pray
for
the
dead
it
is
therefore
a
holy
and
wholesome
thought
to
pray
for
the
dead
that
they
may
be
loosed
from
these
words
are
so
forcible
that
no
comment
of
mine
could
render
them
clearer
the
passage
proved
a
great
to
the
reformers
finding
that
they
could
not
by
any
evasion
weaken
the
force
of
the
text
they
impiously
threw
overboard
the
books
of
machabees
like
a
man
who
assassinates
a
hostile
witness
or
like
the
jews
who
sought
to
kill
lazarus
lest
his
resurrection
should
be
a
testimony
in
favor
of
christ
and
pretended
that
the
two
books
of
machabees
were
apocryphal
and
yet
they
have
precisely
the
same
authority
as
the
gospel
of
matthew
or
any
other
portion
of
the
bible
for
the
canonicity
of
the
holy
scriptures
rests
solely
on
the
authority
of
the
catholic
church
which
proclaimed
them
inspired
but
even
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
books
of
machabees
were
not
entitled
to
be
ranked
among
the
canonical
books
of
holy
scripture
no
one
at
least
has
ever
denied
that
they
are
truthful
historical
monuments
and
as
such
that
they
serve
to
demonstrate
that
it
was
a
prevailing
practice
among
the
hebrew
people
as
it
is
with
us
to
offer
up
prayers
and
sacrifices
for
the
dead
our
savior
the
founder
of
the
new
law
appeared
on
earth
he
came
to
lop
off
those
excrescences
which
had
grown
on
the
body
of
the
jewish
ecclesiastical
code
and
to
purify
the
jewish
church
from
those
human
traditions
which
in
the
course
of
time
became
like
tares
mixed
with
the
wheat
of
sound
doctrine
for
instance
he
condemns
the
pharisees
for
prohibiting
the
performance
of
works
of
charity
on
the
sabbath
day
and
in
the
chapter
of
matthew
he
cites
against
them
a
long
catalogue
of
innovations
in
doctrine
and
discipline
but
did
our
lord
at
any
time
reprove
the
jews
for
their
belief
in
a
middle
state
or
for
praying
for
the
dead
a
practice
which
to
his
knowledge
prevailed
among
the
people
never
on
the
contrary
more
than
once
both
he
and
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
insinuate
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
our
savior
says
whosoever
shall
speak
a
word
against
the
son
of
man
it
shall
be
forgiven
him
but
he
that
shall
speak
against
the
holy
ghost
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
him
neither
in
this
world
nor
in
the
world
to
when
our
savior
declares
that
a
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
shall
not
be
forgiven
in
the
next
life
he
evidently
leaves
us
to
infer
that
there
are
some
sins
which
will
be
pardoned
in
the
life
to
come
now
in
the
next
life
sins
can
not
be
forgiven
in
heaven
for
nothing
defiled
can
enter
there
nor
can
they
be
forgiven
in
hell
for
out
of
hell
there
is
no
redemption
they
must
therefore
be
pardoned
in
the
intermediate
state
of
purgatory
paul
tells
us
that
every
man
s
work
shall
be
manifest
on
the
lord
s
day
the
fire
shall
try
every
man
s
work
of
what
sort
it
is
if
any
man
s
work
abide
that
is
if
his
works
are
holy
he
shall
receive
a
reward
if
any
man
s
work
burn
that
is
if
his
works
are
faulty
and
imperfect
he
shall
suffer
loss
but
he
himself
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
his
soul
will
be
ultimately
saved
but
he
shall
suffer
for
a
temporary
duration
in
the
purifying
flames
of
purgatory
this
interpretation
is
not
mine
it
is
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
fathers
of
christendom
and
who
are
they
that
have
removed
the
landmarks
of
christian
faith
by
rejecting
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
they
are
discontented
churchmen
impatient
of
the
religious
yoke
men
who
appeared
on
the
stage
sixteen
hundred
years
after
the
foundation
of
christianity
judge
you
reader
whom
you
ought
to
follow
if
you
want
to
know
the
true
import
of
a
vital
question
in
the
constitution
would
you
not
follow
the
decision
of
a
story
a
jefferson
a
marshall
a
taney
jurists
and
statesmen
who
were
the
recognized
expounders
of
the
constitution
would
you
not
prefer
their
opinion
to
that
of
political
demagogues
who
have
neither
learning
nor
authority
nor
history
to
support
them
but
some
selfish
end
to
further
now
the
same
motive
which
you
have
for
rejecting
the
opinion
of
an
ignorant
politician
and
embracing
that
of
eminent
jurists
on
a
constitutional
question
impels
you
to
cast
aside
the
novelties
of
religious
innovators
and
to
follow
the
unanimous
sentiments
of
the
fathers
in
reference
to
the
subject
of
purgatory
would
wish
to
place
before
you
extended
extracts
from
the
writings
of
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
bearing
upon
this
subject
but
i
must
content
myself
with
quoting
a
few
of
the
most
prominent
lights
of
primitive
christianity
tertullian
who
lived
in
the
second
century
says
that
the
faithful
wife
will
pray
for
the
soul
of
her
deceased
husband
particularly
on
the
anniversary
day
of
his
falling
asleep
death
and
if
she
fail
to
do
so
she
hath
repudiated
her
husband
as
far
as
in
her
eusebius
the
historian
fourth
century
describing
the
funeral
of
constantine
the
great
says
that
the
body
of
the
blessed
prince
was
placed
on
a
lofty
bier
and
the
ministers
of
god
and
the
multitude
of
the
people
with
tears
and
much
lamentation
offered
up
prayers
and
sacrifice
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
he
adds
that
this
was
done
in
accordance
with
the
desires
of
that
religious
monarch
who
had
erected
in
constantinople
the
great
church
in
honor
of
the
apostles
so
that
after
his
death
the
faithful
might
there
remember
him
cyril
of
jerusalem
fourth
century
writes
we
commemorate
the
holy
fathers
and
bishops
and
all
who
have
fallen
asleep
from
amongst
us
believing
that
the
supplications
which
we
present
will
be
of
great
assistance
to
their
souls
while
the
holy
and
tremendous
sacrifice
is
offered
he
answers
by
an
illustration
those
that
might
be
disposed
to
doubt
the
efficacy
of
prayers
for
the
dead
if
a
king
had
banished
certain
persons
who
had
offended
him
and
their
relations
having
woven
a
crown
should
offer
it
to
him
in
behalf
of
those
under
his
vengeance
would
he
not
grant
a
respite
to
their
punishments
so
we
in
offering
up
a
crown
of
prayers
in
behalf
of
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
will
obtain
for
them
forgiveness
through
the
merits
of
ephrem
in
the
same
century
says
i
conjure
you
my
brethren
and
friends
in
the
name
of
that
god
who
commands
me
to
leave
you
to
remember
me
when
you
assemble
to
pray
do
not
bury
me
with
perfumes
give
them
not
to
me
but
to
god
me
conceived
in
sorrows
bury
with
lamentations
and
instead
of
perfumes
assist
me
with
your
prayers
for
the
dead
are
benefited
by
the
prayers
of
living
ambrose
same
century
on
the
death
of
the
emperors
gratian
and
valentinian
says
blessed
shall
both
of
you
be
gratian
and
valentinian
if
my
prayers
can
avail
anything
no
day
shall
pass
you
over
in
silence
no
prayer
of
mine
shall
omit
to
honor
you
no
night
shall
hurry
by
without
bestowing
on
you
a
mention
in
my
prayers
in
every
one
of
the
oblations
will
i
remember
on
the
death
of
the
emperor
theodosius
he
offers
the
following
prayer
give
perfect
rest
to
thy
servant
theodosius
that
rest
which
thou
hast
prepared
for
thy
saints
may
his
soul
return
thither
whence
it
descended
where
it
can
not
feel
the
sting
of
death
i
loved
him
and
therefore
will
i
follow
him
even
unto
the
land
of
the
living
nor
will
i
leave
him
until
by
tears
and
prayers
i
shall
lead
him
unto
the
holy
mountain
of
the
lord
where
is
life
undying
where
corruption
is
not
nor
sighing
nor
jerome
in
the
same
century
in
a
letter
of
condolence
to
pammachius
on
the
death
of
his
wife
paulina
writes
other
husbands
strew
violets
and
roses
on
the
graves
of
their
wives
our
pammachius
bedews
the
hallowed
dust
of
paulina
with
balsams
of
chrysostom
writes
it
was
not
without
good
reason
by
the
that
mention
should
be
made
of
the
dead
in
the
tremendous
mysteries
because
they
knew
well
that
they
would
receive
great
benefit
from
augustine
who
lived
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
relates
that
when
his
mother
was
at
the
point
of
death
she
made
this
last
request
of
him
lay
this
body
anywhere
let
not
the
care
of
it
in
anyway
disturb
you
this
only
i
request
of
you
that
you
would
remember
me
at
the
altar
of
the
lord
wherever
you
and
that
pious
son
prays
for
his
mother
s
soul
in
the
most
impassioned
language
i
therefore
he
says
o
god
of
my
heart
do
now
beseech
thee
for
the
sins
of
my
mother
hear
me
through
the
medicine
of
the
wounds
that
hung
upon
the
wood
may
she
then
be
in
peace
with
her
husband
and
inspire
my
lord
thy
servants
my
brethren
whom
with
voice
and
heart
and
pen
i
serve
that
as
many
as
shall
read
these
words
may
remember
at
thy
altar
monica
thy
servant
these
are
but
a
few
specimens
of
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
fathers
regarding
the
salutary
practice
of
praying
for
the
dead
you
now
perceive
that
this
devotion
is
not
an
invention
of
modern
times
but
a
doctrine
universally
enforced
in
the
first
and
purest
ages
of
the
church
you
see
that
praying
for
the
dead
was
not
a
devotion
cautiously
recommended
by
some
obscure
or
visionary
writer
but
an
act
of
religion
preached
and
inculcated
by
all
the
great
doctors
and
fathers
of
the
church
who
are
the
recognized
expounders
of
the
christian
religion
you
see
them
too
inculcating
this
doctrine
not
as
a
cold
and
abstract
principle
but
as
an
imperative
act
of
daily
piety
and
embodying
it
in
their
ordinary
exercises
of
devotion
they
prayed
for
the
dead
in
their
morning
and
evening
devotions
they
prayed
for
them
in
their
daily
office
and
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
they
asked
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
for
the
souls
of
the
deceased
in
the
public
services
of
sunday
on
the
monuments
which
were
erected
to
the
dead
some
of
which
are
preserved
even
to
this
day
epitaphs
were
inscribed
earnestly
invoking
for
their
souls
the
prayers
of
the
living
how
gratifying
it
is
to
our
catholic
hearts
that
a
devotion
so
soothing
to
afflicted
spirits
is
at
the
same
time
so
firmly
grounded
on
the
tradition
of
ages
the
practice
of
praying
for
the
dead
has
descended
from
apostolic
times
is
evident
also
from
the
of
the
church
a
liturgy
is
the
established
formulary
of
public
worship
containing
the
authorized
prayers
of
the
church
the
missal
or
for
instance
which
you
see
on
our
altars
contains
a
portion
of
the
liturgy
of
the
catholic
church
the
principal
liturgies
are
the
liturgy
of
james
the
apostle
who
founded
the
church
of
jerusalem
the
liturgy
of
mark
the
evangelist
founder
of
the
church
of
alexandria
and
the
liturgy
of
peter
who
established
the
church
in
rome
these
liturgies
are
called
after
the
apostles
who
compiled
them
there
are
besides
the
liturgies
of
chrysostom
and
st
basil
which
are
chiefly
based
on
the
model
of
that
of
james
now
all
these
liturgies
without
exception
have
prayers
for
the
dead
and
their
providential
preservation
serves
as
another
triumphant
vindication
of
the
venerable
antiquity
of
this
catholic
doctrine
the
eastern
and
the
western
churches
were
happily
united
until
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
when
the
heresiarchs
arius
nestorius
and
eutyches
withdrew
millions
of
souls
from
the
centre
of
unity
the
followers
of
these
sects
were
called
after
their
founders
arians
nestorians
and
eutychians
and
from
that
day
to
the
present
the
two
latter
bodies
have
formed
distinct
communions
being
separated
from
the
catholic
church
in
the
east
just
as
the
protestant
churches
are
separated
from
her
in
the
west
the
greek
schismatic
church
of
which
the
present
church
is
the
offspring
severed
her
connection
with
the
see
of
rome
in
the
ninth
century
but
in
leaving
the
catholic
church
these
eastern
sects
retained
the
old
liturgies
which
they
use
to
this
day
as
i
shall
presently
demonstrate
during
my
sojourn
in
rome
at
the
ecumenical
council
i
devoted
a
great
deal
of
my
leisure
time
to
the
examination
of
the
various
liturgies
of
the
schismatic
churches
of
the
east
i
found
in
all
of
them
formulas
of
prayers
for
the
dead
almost
identical
with
that
of
the
roman
missal
remember
o
lord
thy
servants
who
are
gone
before
us
with
the
sign
of
faith
and
sleep
in
peace
to
these
o
lord
and
to
all
who
rest
in
christ
grant
we
beseech
thee
a
place
of
refreshment
light
and
peace
through
the
same
jesus
christ
our
not
content
with
studying
their
books
i
called
upon
the
oriental
patriarchs
and
bishops
in
communion
with
the
see
of
rome
who
belong
to
the
armenian
the
chaldean
the
coptic
the
maronite
and
syriac
rites
they
all
assured
me
that
the
schismatic
christians
of
the
east
among
whom
they
live
have
without
exception
prayers
and
sacrifices
for
the
dead
now
i
ask
when
could
those
eastern
sects
have
commenced
to
adopt
the
catholic
practice
of
praying
for
the
dead
they
could
not
have
received
it
from
us
since
the
ninth
century
because
the
greek
church
separated
from
us
then
and
has
had
no
communion
with
us
since
that
time
except
at
intervals
up
to
the
twelfth
century
nor
could
they
have
adopted
the
practice
since
the
fourth
or
fifth
century
inasmuch
as
the
arians
nestorians
and
eutychians
have
had
no
religious
communication
with
us
since
that
period
therefore
in
common
with
us
they
received
this
doctrine
from
the
apostles
if
men
living
in
different
countries
drink
wine
having
the
same
flavor
and
taste
and
color
the
inference
is
that
the
wine
was
made
from
the
same
species
of
grape
so
must
we
conclude
that
this
refreshing
doctrine
of
intercession
for
the
dead
has
its
root
in
the
apostolic
tree
of
knowledge
planted
by
our
savior
have
already
spoken
of
the
devotion
of
the
ancient
jewish
church
to
the
souls
of
the
departed
but
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
the
jews
retain
to
this
day
in
their
liturgy
the
pious
practice
of
praying
for
the
dead
yet
such
in
reality
is
the
case
amid
all
the
wanderings
and
vicissitudes
of
life
though
dismembered
and
dispersed
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
over
the
face
of
the
globe
the
children
of
israel
have
never
forgotten
or
neglected
the
sacred
duty
of
praying
for
their
deceased
brethren
unwilling
to
make
this
assertion
without
the
strongest
evidence
i
procured
from
a
jewish
convert
an
authorized
of
the
hebrew
church
from
which
i
extract
the
following
formula
of
prayers
which
are
prescribed
for
funerals
departed
brother
mayest
thou
find
open
the
gates
of
heaven
and
see
the
city
of
peace
and
the
dwellings
of
safety
and
meet
the
ministering
angels
hastening
joyfully
toward
thee
and
may
the
high
priest
stand
to
receive
thee
and
go
thou
to
the
end
rest
in
peace
and
rise
again
into
life
may
the
repose
established
in
the
celestial
abode
be
the
lot
dwelling
and
the
of
the
soul
of
our
deceased
brother
whom
the
spirit
of
the
lord
may
guide
into
paradise
who
departed
from
this
world
according
to
the
will
of
god
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
may
the
supreme
king
of
kings
through
his
infinite
mercy
hide
him
under
the
shadow
of
his
wing
may
he
raise
him
at
the
end
of
his
days
and
cause
him
to
drink
of
the
stream
of
his
among
the
merits
of
shakespeare
may
be
mentioned
his
happy
faculty
of
portraying
to
life
the
manners
and
customs
and
traditional
faith
of
the
times
which
he
describes
how
in
the
christian
heart
in
times
was
the
belief
in
purgatory
may
be
inferred
from
a
passage
in
hamlet
who
probably
lived
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighth
century
thus
speaks
to
hamlet
the
spirit
of
his
murdered
father
i
am
thy
father
s
spirit
doom
d
for
a
certain
time
to
walk
the
night
and
for
the
day
confin
d
too
fast
in
fires
till
the
foul
crimes
done
in
my
days
of
nature
are
burnt
and
purg
d
i
am
happy
to
say
that
the
more
advanced
and
enlightened
members
of
the
episcopalian
church
are
steadily
returning
to
the
faith
of
their
regarding
prayers
for
the
dead
an
acquaintance
of
mine
once
a
distinguished
clergyman
of
the
episcopal
communion
but
now
a
convert
informed
me
that
hundreds
of
protestant
clergymen
in
this
country
and
particularly
in
england
have
a
firm
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
prayers
for
the
dead
but
for
reasons
they
are
reserved
in
the
expression
of
their
faith
he
easily
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
his
assertion
particularly
as
far
as
the
church
of
england
is
concerned
by
sending
me
six
different
works
published
in
london
all
bearing
on
the
subject
of
purgatory
these
books
are
printed
under
the
auspices
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
they
all
contain
prayers
for
the
dead
and
prove
from
catholic
grounds
the
existence
of
a
middle
state
after
death
and
the
duty
of
praying
for
our
deceased
brethren
to
sum
up
we
see
the
practice
of
praying
for
the
dead
enforced
in
the
ancient
hebrew
church
and
in
the
jewish
synagogue
of
today
we
see
it
proclaimed
age
after
age
by
all
the
fathers
of
christendom
we
see
it
incorporated
in
every
one
of
the
ancient
liturgies
of
the
east
and
of
the
west
we
see
it
zealously
taught
by
the
russian
church
of
today
and
by
that
immense
family
of
schismatic
christians
scattered
over
the
east
we
behold
it
in
fine
a
cherished
devotion
of
three
hundred
millions
of
catholics
as
well
as
of
a
respectable
portion
of
the
episcopal
church
would
it
not
my
friend
be
the
height
of
rashness
and
presumption
in
you
to
prefer
your
private
opinion
to
this
immense
weight
of
learning
sanctity
and
authority
would
it
not
be
impiety
in
you
to
stand
aside
with
sealed
lips
while
the
christian
world
is
sending
up
an
unceasing
for
departed
brethren
would
it
not
be
cold
and
heartless
in
you
not
to
pray
for
your
deceased
friends
on
account
of
prejudices
which
have
no
grounds
in
scripture
tradition
or
reason
itself
if
a
brother
leaves
you
to
cross
the
broad
atlantic
religion
and
affection
prompt
you
to
pray
for
him
during
his
absence
and
if
the
same
brother
crosses
the
narrow
sea
of
death
to
pass
to
the
shores
of
eternity
why
not
pray
for
him
then
also
when
he
crosses
the
atlantic
his
soul
imprisoned
in
the
flesh
is
absent
from
you
when
he
passes
the
sea
of
death
his
soul
released
from
the
flesh
has
gone
from
you
what
difference
does
this
make
with
regard
to
the
duty
of
your
intercession
for
what
is
death
a
mere
separation
of
body
and
soul
the
body
indeed
dies
but
the
soul
lives
and
moves
and
has
its
it
continues
after
death
as
before
to
think
to
remember
to
love
and
do
not
god
s
dominion
and
mercy
extend
over
that
soul
beyond
the
grave
as
well
as
as
this
side
of
it
who
shall
place
the
limits
to
god
s
empire
and
say
to
him
thus
far
thou
shalt
go
and
no
farther
two
thousand
years
after
abraham
s
death
our
lord
said
i
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
he
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
if
then
it
is
profitable
for
you
to
pray
for
your
brother
in
the
flesh
why
should
it
be
useless
for
you
to
pray
for
him
out
of
the
flesh
for
while
he
was
living
you
prayed
not
for
his
body
but
for
his
soul
if
this
brother
of
yours
dies
with
some
slight
stains
upon
his
soul
a
sin
of
impatience
for
instance
or
an
idle
word
is
he
fit
to
enter
heaven
with
these
blemishes
upon
his
soul
no
the
sanctity
of
god
forbids
it
for
nothing
defiled
shall
enter
the
kingdom
of
will
you
consign
him
for
these
minor
transgressions
to
eternal
torments
with
adulterers
and
murderers
no
the
justice
and
mercy
of
god
forbid
it
therefore
your
common
sense
demands
a
middle
place
of
expiation
for
the
purgation
of
the
soul
before
it
is
worthy
of
enjoying
the
companionship
of
god
and
his
saints
god
will
render
to
every
man
according
to
his
works
the
pure
and
unsullied
everlasting
bliss
to
the
reprobate
eternal
damnation
to
souls
stained
with
minor
faults
a
place
of
temporary
purgation
i
can
not
recall
any
doctrine
of
the
christian
religion
more
consoling
to
the
human
heart
than
the
article
of
faith
which
teaches
the
efficacy
of
prayers
for
the
faithful
departed
it
robs
death
of
its
sting
it
encircles
the
chamber
of
mourning
with
a
rainbow
of
hope
it
assuages
the
bitterness
of
our
sorrow
and
reconciles
us
to
our
loss
it
keeps
us
in
touch
with
the
departed
dead
as
correspondence
keeps
us
in
touch
with
the
absent
living
it
preserves
their
memory
fresh
and
green
in
our
hearts
it
gives
us
that
keen
satisfaction
which
springs
from
the
consciousness
that
we
can
aid
those
loved
ones
who
are
gone
before
us
by
alleviating
their
pains
shortening
their
exile
and
hastening
their
entrance
into
their
true
country
it
familiarizes
us
with
the
existence
of
a
life
beyond
the
grave
and
with
the
hope
of
being
reunited
with
those
whom
we
cherished
on
earth
and
of
dwelling
with
them
in
that
home
where
there
is
no
separation
or
sorrow
or
death
but
eternal
joy
and
peace
and
rest
i
have
seen
a
devoted
daughter
minister
with
tender
solicitude
at
the
of
a
fond
parent
many
an
anxious
day
and
sleepless
night
did
she
watch
at
his
bedside
she
moistened
the
parched
lips
and
cooled
the
fevered
brow
and
raised
the
drooping
head
on
its
pillow
every
change
in
her
patient
for
better
or
worse
brought
a
corresponding
sunshine
or
gloom
to
her
heart
it
was
filial
love
that
prompted
all
this
her
father
died
and
she
followed
his
remains
to
the
grave
though
not
a
catholic
standing
by
the
bier
she
burst
those
chains
which
a
cruel
religious
prejudice
had
wrought
around
her
heart
and
rising
superior
to
her
sect
she
cried
out
have
mercy
on
his
it
was
the
voice
of
nature
and
of
religion
oh
far
from
us
a
religion
which
would
decree
an
eternal
divorce
between
the
living
and
the
dead
how
consoling
is
it
to
the
catholic
to
think
that
in
praying
thus
for
his
departed
friend
his
prayers
are
not
in
violation
of
but
in
accordance
with
the
voice
of
the
church
and
that
as
like
augustine
he
watches
at
the
pillow
of
a
dying
mother
so
like
augustine
he
can
continue
the
same
office
of
piety
for
her
soul
after
she
is
dead
by
praying
for
her
how
cheering
the
reflection
that
the
golden
link
of
prayer
unites
you
still
to
those
who
fell
asleep
in
the
lord
that
you
can
still
speak
to
them
and
pray
for
them
tennyson

the
catholic
feeling
when
he
makes
his
hero
whose
course
is
run
thus
address
his
surviving
comrade
sir
bedivere
i
have
lived
my
life
and
that
which
i
have
done
may
he
within
himself
make
pure
but
thou
if
thou
shouldst
never
see
my
face
again
pray
for
my
soul
more
things
are
wrought
by
prayer
than
this
world
dreams
of
wherefore
let
thy
voice
rise
like
a
fountain
for
me
night
and
day
for
what
are
men
better
than
sheep
or
goats
that
nourish
a
blind
life
within
the
brain
if
knowing
god
they
lift
not
hands
of
prayer
both
for
themselves
and
those
who
call
them
friend
for
so
the
whole
round
earth
is
every
way
bound
by
gold
chains
about
the
feet
of
oh
it
is
this
thought
that
robs
death
of
its
sting
and
makes
the
separation
of
friends
endurable
if
your
departed
friend
needs
not
your
prayers
they
are
not
lost
but
like
the
rain
absorbed
by
the
sun
and
descending
again
in
fruitful
showers
on
our
fields
they
will
be
gathered
by
the
sun
of
justice
and
will
fall
in
refreshing
showers
of

chapter
xvii
civil
and
religious
liberty
a
man
enjoys
liberty
when
he
possesses
the
free
right
of
worshiping
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
a
right
conscience
and
of
practicing
a
form
of
religion
most
in
accordance
with
his
duties
to
god
every
act
infringing
on
his
freedom
of
conscience
is
justly
styled
religious
intolerance
this
religious
liberty
is
the
true
right
of
every
man
because
it
corresponds
with
a
most
certain
duty
which
god
has
put
upon
him
a
man
enjoys
liberty
when
he
is
exempt
from
the
arbitrary
will
of
others
and
when
he
is
governed
by
equitable
laws
established
for
the
general
welfare
of
society
so
long
as
in
common
with
his
he
observes
the
laws
of
the
state
any
exceptional
restraint
imposed
upon
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
rights
as
a
citizen
is
so
far
an
infringement
on
his
civil
liberty
i
here
assert
the
proposition
which
i
hope
to
confirm
by
historical
evidence
that
the
catholic
church
has
always
been
the
zealous
promoter
of
religious
and
civil
liberty
and
that
whenever
any
encroachments
on
these
sacred
privileges
of
man
were
perpetrated
by
professing
members
of
the
catholic
faith
these
wrongs
far
from
being
sanctioned
by
the
church
were
committed
in
palpable
violation
of
her
authority
her
doctrine
is
that
as
man
by
his
free
fell
from
grace
so
of
his
free
must
he
return
to
grace
conversion
and
coercion
are
two
terms
that
can
never
be
reconciled
it
has
ever
been
a
cardinal
maxim
inculcated
by
sovereign
pontiffs
and
other
prelates
that
no
violence
or
undue
influence
should
be
exercised
by
christian
princes
or
missionaries
in
their
efforts
to
convert
souls
to
the
faith
of
jesus
christ
pope
gregory
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixth
century
compelled
the
bishop
of
terracina
to
restore
to
the
jews
the
synagogue
which
he
had
seized
declaring
that
they
should
not
be
coerced
into
the
church
but
should
be
treated
with
meekness
and
charity
the
great
pontiff
issued
the
same
orders
to
the
prelates
of
sardinia
and
sicily
in
behalf
of
the
persecuted
jews
augustine
and
his
companions
who
were
sent
by
pope
gregory
to
england
for
the
conversion
of
that
nation
had
the
happiness
of
baptizing
in
the
true
faith
king
ethelbert
and
many
of
his
subjects
that
monarch
in
the
fervor
of
his
zeal
was
most
anxious
that
all
his
subjects
should
immediately
follow
his
example
but
the
missionaries
admonished
him
that
he
should
scrupulously
abstain
from
violence
in
the
conversion
of
his
people
for
the
christian
religion
should
be
voluntarily
embraced
pope
nicholas
also
warned
michael
king
of
the
bulgarians
against
employing
force
or
constraint
in
the
conversion
of
idolaters
the
fourth
council
of
toledo
held
in
a
synod
of
great
authority
in
the
church
ordained
that
no
one
should
be
compelled
against
his
will
to
make
a
profession
of
the
christian
faith
be
it
remembered
that
this
council
was
composed
of
all
the
bishops
of
spain
that
it
was
assembled
in
a
country
and
at
a
time
in
which
the
church
held
almost
unlimited
sway
and
among
a
people
who
have
been
represented
as
the
most
fanatical
and
intolerant
of
all
europe
perhaps
no
man
can
be
considered
a
fairer
representative
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
than
bernard
the
illustrious
abbot
of
clairvaux
he
was
the
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
his
life
is
the
key
that
discloses
to
us
what
degree
of
toleration
prevailed
in
those
days
having
heard
that
a
fanatical
preacher
was
stimulating
the
people
to
deeds
of
violence
against
the
jews
as
the
enemies
of
christianity
bernard
raised
his
eloquent
voice
against
him
and
rescued
those
persecuted
people
from
the
danger
to
which
they
were
exposed
pope
innocent
iii
in
the
thirteenth
century
promulgated
the
following
decree
in
behalf
of
the
hebrews
let
no
jew
be
to
receive
baptism
and
he
that
will
not
consent
to
be
baptized
let
him
not
be
molested
let
no
one
unjustly
seize
their
property
disturb
their
feasts
or
lay
waste
their
other
succeeding
pontiffs
notably
gregory
ix
and
innocent
issued
similar
instructions
not
to
cite
too
many
examples
let
me
quote
for
you
only
the
beautiful
letter
addressed
by
fenelon
archbishop
of
cambray
to
the
son
of
king
james
ii
of
england
this
letter
not
only
reflects
the
sentiments
of
his
own
heart
but
formularizes
in
this
particular
the
decrees
of
the
church
of
which
he
was
a
distinguished
ornament
above
all
he
writes
never
force
your
subjects
to
change
their
religion
no
human
power
can
reach
the
impenetrable
recess
of
the
free
will
of
the
heart
violence
can
never
persuade
men
it
serves
only
to
make
hypocrites
grant
civil
liberty
to
all
not
in
approving
everything
as
indifferent
but
in
tolerating
with
patience
whatever
almighty
god
tolerates
and
endeavoring
to
convert
men
by
mild
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
catholic
church
spares
no
pains
and
stops
at
no
sacrifice
in
order
to
induce
mankind
to
embrace
her
faith
otherwise
she
would
be
recreant
to
her
sacred
mission
but
she
scorns
to
exercise
any
undue
influence
in
her
efforts
to
convert
souls
the
only
argument
she
would
use
is
the
argument
of
reason
and
persuasion
the
only
tribunal
to
which
she
would
summon
you
is
the
tribunal
of
conscience
the
only
weapon
she
would
wield
is
the
sword
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
word
of
it
is
well
known
that
the
superior
advantages
of
our
female
academies
throughout
the
country
lead
many
of
our
dissenting
brethren
to
send
their
daughters
to
these
institutions
it
is
also
well
known
that
so
warm
is
the
affection
which
these
young
ladies
entertain
for
their
religious
teachers
so
hallowed
is
the
atmosphere
they
breathe
within
these
seats
of
learning
that
they
often
beg
to
embrace
a
religion
which
fosters
so
much
piety
and
which
produces
lilies
so
fragrant
and
so
pure
do
the
sisters
take
advantage
of
this
influence
in
the
cause
of
proselytism
by
no
means
so
delicate
is
their
regard
for
the
religious
conscience
of
their
pupils
that
they
rarely
consent
to
have
these
young
ladies
baptized
till
after
being
thoroughly
instructed
in
all
the
doctrines
of
the
church
they
have
obtained
the
free
permission
of
their
parents
or
guardians
the
church
is
indeed
intolerant
in
this
sense
that
she
can
never
confound
truth
with
error
nor
can
she
admit
that
any
man
is
conscientiously
free
to
reject
the
truth
when
its
claims
are
convincingly
brought
home
to
the
mind
many
protestants
seem
to
be
very
much
disturbed
by
some
such
argument
as
this
catholics
are
very
ready
now
to
proclaim
freedom
of
conscience
because
they
are
in
the
minority
when
they
once
succeed
in
getting
the
upper
hand
in
numbers
and
power
they
will
destroy
this
freedom
because
their
faith
teaches
them
to
tolerate
no
doctrine
other
than
the
catholic
it
is
then
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
for
us
that
they
should
never
be
allowed
to
get
this
advantage
now
in
all
this
there
is
a
great
mistake
which
comes
from
not
knowing
the
catholic
doctrine
in
its
fulness
i
shall
not
lay
it
down
myself
lest
it
seem
to
have
been
gotten
up
for
the
occasion
i
shall
quote
the
great
theologian
becanus
who
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
schools
of
catholic
theology
at
the
time
when
the
struggle
was
hottest
between
catholicity
and
protestantism
he
says
that
religious
liberty
may
be
tolerated
by
a
ruler
when
it
would
do
more
harm
to
the
state
or
to
the
community
to
repress
it
the
ruler
may
even
enter
into
a
compact
in
order
to
secure
to
his
subjects
this
freedom
in
religious
matters
and
when
once
a
compact
is
made
it
must
be
observed
absolutely
in
every
point
just
as
every
other
lawful
and
honest
contract
this
is
the
true
catholic
teaching
on
this
point
according
to
becanus
and
all
catholic
theologians
so
that
if
catholics
should
gain
the
majority
in
a
community
where
freedom
of
conscience
is
already
secured
to
all
by
law
their
very
religion
obliges
them
to
respect
the
rights
thus
acquired
by
their
what
danger
can
there
be
then
for
protestants
if
catholics
should
be
in
the
majority
here
their
apprehensions
are
the
result
of
vain
fears
which
no
honest
mind
ought
any
longer
to
harbor
the
church
has
not
only
respected
the
conscience
of
the
people
in
embracing
the
religion
of
their
choice
but
she
has
also
defended
their
rights
and
liberties
against
the
encroachments
of
temporal
sovereigns
one
of
the
popular
errors
that
have
taken
possession
of
some
minds
in
our
times
is
that
in
former
days
the
church
was
leagued
with
princes
for
the
oppression
of
the
people
this
is
a
base
calumny
which
a
slight
acquaintance
with
ecclesiastical
history
would
soon
dispel
the
truth
is
the
most
unrelenting
enemies
of
the
church
have
been
the
princes
of
this
world
and
christians
princes
too
the
conflict
between
church
and
state
has
never
died
out
because
the
church
has
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
in
every
age
to
raise
her
voice
against
the
despotic
and
arbitrary
measures
of
princes
many
of
them
chafed
under
the
salutary
discipline
of
the
church
they
wished
to
be
rid
of
her
yoke
they
desired
to
be
governed
by
no
law
except
the
law
of
their
licentious
passions
and
boundless
ambitions
and
as
a
protestant
american
reviewer
well
said
about
forty
years
ago
it
was
a
blessing
of
providence
that
there
was
a
spiritual
power
on
earth
that
could
stand
like
a
wall
of
brass
against
the
tyranny
of
earthly
sovereigns
and
say
to
them
thus
far
you
shall
go
and
no
farther
and
here
you
shall
break
your
swelling
waves
of
passion
a
power
that
could
say
to
them
what
john
said
to
herod
this
thing
is
not
lawful
for
thee
a
power
that
pointed
the
finger
of
reproof
to
them
even
when
the
sword
was
pointed
to
her
own
neck
and
that
said
to
them
what
nathan
said
to
david
thou
art
the
she
told
princes
that
if
the
people
have
their
obligations
they
have
their
rights
too
that
if
the
subject
must
render
to
cæsar
the
things
that
are
cæsar
s
cæsar
must
render
to
god
the
things
that
art
god
s
yes
the
church
while
pursuing
her
divine
mission
of
leading
souls
to
god
has
ever
been
the
defender
of
the
people
s
rights
ambrose
archbishop
of
milan
affords
us
a
striking
instance
of
the
strenuous
efforts
made
by
the
catholic
church
in
vindicating
the
interests
of
the
citizen
against
the
oppression
of
rulers
a
portion
of
the
people
of
thessalonica
had
committed
an
outrage
against
the
just
authority
of
the
emperor
theodosius
the
offence
of
those
citizens
was
indeed
most
reprehensible
but
the
emperor
requited
the
insult
offered
to
him
by
a
shocking
and
disproportioned
act
of
retribution
which
has
left
an
indelible
stain
upon
his
otherwise
excellent
character
the
inhabitants
were
assembled
together
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
witnessing
a
chariot
race
and
at
a
given
signal
the
soldiery
fell
upon
the
people
and
involved
men
women
and
children
in
an
indiscriminate
massacre
to
the
number
of
about
seven
thousand
some
time
after
the
emperor
presented
himself
at
the
cathedral
of
milan
but
the
intrepid
prelate
told
him
that
his
hands
were
dripping
with
the
blood
of
his
subjects
and
forbade
him
entrance
to
the
church
till
he
had
made
all
the
reparation
in
his
power
to
the
afflicted
people
of
thessalonica
people
affect
to
be
shocked
at
the
sentence
of
occasionally
inflicted
by
the
church
on
here
is
an
instance
of
this
penalty
who
can
complain
of
it
as
being
too
severe
it
was
a
salutary
punishment
and
the
only
one
that
could
bring
rulers
to
a
sense
of
duty
the
greatest
bulwark
of
civil
liberty
is
the
famous
it
is
the
foundation
not
only
of
british
but
also
of
american
constitutional
freedom
among
other
blessings
contained
in
this
instrument
it
establishes
trial
by
jury
and
the
right
of
and
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
taxation
without
representation
who
were
the
framers
of
this
memorable
charter
archbishop
langton
of
canterbury
and
the
catholic
barons
of
england
on
the
plains
of
runnymede
in
they
compelled
king
john
to
sign
that
paper
which
was
the
to
his
arbitrary
power
and
the
cornerstone
of
constitutional
government
turning
to
our
own
country
it
is
with
no
small
degree
of
satisfaction
that
i
point
to
the
state
of
maryland
as
the
cradle
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
the
land
of
the
of
the
thirteen
original
american
colonies
maryland
was
the
only
one
settled
by
catholics
she
was
also
the
only
one
that
raised
aloft
over
her
fair
lands
the
banner
of
liberty
of
conscience
and
that
invited
the
oppressed
of
other
colonies
to
seek
an
asylum
beneath
its
shadow
lest
i
should
be
suspected
of
being
too
partial
in
my
praise
of
maryland
toleration
i
shall
take
most
of
my
historical
facts
from
bancroft
a
new
england
protestant
clergyman
first
edition
of
bancroft
s
history
was
published
in
from
that
date
till
nearly
half
a
century
afterward
upwards
of
twenty
editions
were
issued
all
of
which
retain
the
passages
i
have
cited
on
maryland
toleration
early
in
the
a
new
edition
was
given
out
which
omits
or
abridges
some
of
the
passages
quoted
in
this
chapter
i
may
add
that
all
of
bancroft
s
eulogies
of
lord
baltimore
s
benevolent
administration
are
borne
out
by
the
original
documents
and
by
mcmahon
bozman
and
mcsherry
and
other
historians
of
maryland
leonard
calvert
the
brother
of
lord
baltimore
and
the
leader
of
the
catholic
colony
having
sailed
from
england
in
the
and
the
reached
his
destination
on
the
potomac
in
march
the
catholics
took
quiet
possession
of
the
little
place
and
religious
liberty
obtained
a
home
only
in
the
wide
world
at
the
humble
village
which
bore
the
name
of
the
foundation
of
the
colony
of
maryland
was
peacefully
and
happily
laid
within
six
months
it
had
advanced
more
than
virginia
had
done
in
as
many
years
but
far
more
memorable
was
the
character
of
the
maryland
institutions
every
other
country
in
the
world
had
persecuting
laws
but
through
the
benign
administration
of
the
government
of
that
province
no
person
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
was
permitted
to
be
molested
on
account
of
religion
under
the
munificence
and
superintending
mildness
of
lord
baltimore
a
dreary
wilderness
was
soon
quickened
with
the
swarming
life
and
activity
of
prosperous
settlements
the
roman
catholics
who
were
oppressed
by
the
laws
of
england
were
sure
to
find
a
peaceful
asylum
in
the
quiet
harbors
of
the
chesapeake
and
there
protestants
were
sheltered
against
protestant
such
were
the
beautiful
auspices
under
which
maryland
started
into
being
its
history
is
the
history
of
benevolence
gratitude
and
maryland
was
the
abode
of
happiness
and
liberty
conscience
was
without
restraint
a
mild
and
liberal
proprietary
conceded
every
measure
which
the
welfare
of
the
colony
required
domestic
union
a
happy
concert
between
all
the
branches
of
government
an
increasing
emigration
a
productive
commerce
a
fertile
soil
which
heaven
had
richly
favored
with
rivers
and
deep
bays
united
to
perfect
the
scene
of
colonial
felicity
ever
intent
on
advancing
the
interests
of
his
colony
lord
baltimore
invited
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
to
emigrate
to
maryland
offering
them
lands
and
privileges
and
free
liberty
of
religion
but
gibbons
to
whom
he
had
forwarded
the
commission
was
so
wholly
tutored
in
the
new
england
discipline
that
he
would
not
advance
the
wishes
of
the
irish
peer
and
so
the
invitation
was
on
the
of
april
the
general
assembly
of
maryland
passed
the
following
act
which
will
reflect
unfading
glory
on
that
state
as
long
as
liberty
is
cherished
in
the
hearts
of
men
whereas
the
enforcing
of
conscience
in
matters
of
religion
hath
frequently
fallen
out
to
be
of
dangerous
consequence
in
those
commonwealths
where
it
has
been
practiced
and
for
the
more
quiet
and
peaceable
government
of
this
province
and
the
better
to
preserve
mutual
love
and
unity
amongst
the
inhabitants
no
person
whatsoever
within
this
province
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
shall
from
henceforth
be
anyways
troubled
or
molested
for
his
or
her
religion
nor
in
the
free
exercise
thereof
nor
anyway
compelled
to
the
belief
or
exercise
of
any
other
religion
against
his
or
her
upon
this
noble
statute
bancroft
makes
the
following
candid
and
judicious
comment
the
design
of
the
law
of
maryland
was
to
protect
freedom
of
conscience
and
some
years
after
it
had
been
confirmed
the
apologist
of
lord
baltimore
could
assert
that
his
government
had
never
given
disturbance
to
any
person
in
maryland
for
matter
of
religion
that
the
colonists
enjoyed
freedom
of
conscience
not
less
than
freedom
of
person
and
estate
as
amply
as
ever
any
people
in
any
place
of
the
world
the
disfranchised
friends
of
prelacy
from
massachusetts
and
the
puritans
from
virginia
were
welcomed
to
equal
liberty
of
conscience
and
political
rights
in
the
roman
catholic
province
of
five
years
later
when
the
puritans
gained
the
ascendency
in
maryland
they
were
guilty
of
the
infamous
ingratitude
of
disfranchising
the
very
catholic
settlers
by
whom
they
had
been
so
hospitably
entertained
they
had
neither
the
gratitude
to
respect
the
rights
of
the
government
by
which
they
had
been
received
and
fostered
nor
magnanimity
to
continue
the
toleration
to
which
alone
they
were
indebted
for
their
residence
in
the
colony
an
act
concerning
religion
forbade
liberty
of
conscience
to
be
extended
to
popery
prelacy
or
licentiousness
of
i
shall
also
quote
from
maryland
the
history
of
a
palatinate
by
william
hand
browne
browne
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
maryland
for
several
years
he
was
editor
of
the
maryland
archives
and
of
the
maryland
historical
society
he
became
afterward
professor
of
english
literature
in
the
johns
hopkins
university
he
devoted
his
long
life
to
the
colonial
history
of
maryland
and
is
justly
recognized
as
a
standard
authority
on
that
subject
i
may
add
that
he
can
not
be
suspected
of
undue
partiality
as
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
catholic
church
speaking
of
calvert
the
proprietary
of
the
maryland
colony
the
author
remarks
that
while
as
yet
there
was
no
spot
in
christendom
where
religious
belief
was
free
and
when
even
the
commons
of
england
had
openly
declared
against
toleration
calvert
founded
a
community
wherein
no
man
was
to
be
molested
for
his
faith
at
a
time
when
absolutism
had
struck
down
representative
government
in
england
and
it
was
doubtful
if
a
parliament
of
freemen
would
ever
meet
again
he
founded
a
community
in
which
no
laws
were
to
be
made
without
the
consent
of
the
freemen
the
and
the
were
names
of
happy
omen
the
one
saved
from
the
general
wreck
the
germs
of
political
liberty
and
the
other
bore
the
olive
branch
of
religious
when
the
rule
of
the
catholic
proprietary
was
overthrown
and
the
puritans
had
gained
the
ascendency
in
the
province
the
new
commissioners
issued
writs
of
election
to
a
general
of
a
tenor
hitherto
unknown
in
maryland
no
man
of
the
roman
catholic
faith
could
be
elected
as
a
burgess
or
even
cast
a
vote
the
assembly
obtained
by
this
process
of
selection
justified
its
choice
it
at
once
repealed
the
toleration
act
of
and
created
a
new
one
more
to
its
mind
which
also
bore
the
title
an
act
concerning
religion
but
it
was
toleration
with
a
difference
it
provided
that
none
who
professed
the
popish
religion
should
be
protected
in
the
province
but
were
to
be
restrained
from
the
exercise
thereof
for
protestants
it
provided
that
no
one
professing
faith
in
christ
was
to
be
restrained
from
the
exercise
of
his
religion
provided
that
this
liberty
be
not
extended
to
popery
or
prelacy
nor
to
such
as
under
the
profession
of
christ
hold
forth
and
practice
licentiousness
that
is
with
the
exception
of
the
roman
catholics
and
churchmen
together
with
the
brownists
quakers
anabaptists
and
other
miscellaneous
protestant
sects
all
others
might
profess
their
faith
without
after
the
overthrow
of
the
puritan
authority
and
the
advent
to
power
of
the
members
of
the
church
of
england
the
second
act
of
the
assembly
was
to
make
the
protestant
episcopal
church
the
established
church
of
the
province
the
act
imposed
an
annual
tax
of
forty
pounds
of
tobacco
per
poll
on
all
taxables
for
the
purpose
of
building
churches
and
maintaining
the
clergy
in
it
was
with
a
toleration
clause
protestant
dissenters
and
quakers
were
exempted
from
the
penalties
and
disabilities
and
might
have
separate
provided
that
they
paid
their
forty
pounds
per
poll
to
support
the
established
church
as
for
the
papists
it
is
needless
to
say
that
there
was
no
exemption
nor
license
for
the
author
then
sets
before
us
the
three
kinds
of
toleration
like
three
portraits
so
that
their
distinctive
features
appear
in
bold
relief
we
may
now
he
says
place
side
by
side
the
three
tolerations
of
the
toleration
of
the
catholic
proprietaries
lasted
fifty
years
and
under
it
all
believers
in
christ
were
equal
before
the
law
and
all
support
to
churches
or
ministers
was
voluntary
the
puritan
toleration
lasted
six
years
and
included
all
but
papists
prelatists
and
those
who
held
objectional
doctrines
the
anglican
toleration
lasted
eighty
years
and
had
glebes
and
churches
for
the
establishment
connivance
for
dissenters
the
penal
laws
for
catholics
and
for
all
the
forty
per
poll
in
fact
an
additional
turn
was
given
to
the
screw
in
this
year
the
oath
of
abhorrency
a
more
offensive
form
of
the
oath
of
supremacy
being
required
beside
the
oath
of
allegiance
and
for
one
thing
no
catholic
attorney
was
allowed
to
practise
in
the
province
when
the
members
of
the
constitutional
convention
declared
in
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
they
were
echoing
the
sentiments
and
even
repeating
the
language
of
the
maryland
assembly
of
which
declared
that
no
person
whatsoever
within
this
province
professing
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
shall
from
henceforth
be
any
ways
molested
for
his
or
her
religion
nor
in
the
free
exercise
we
may
therefore
affirm
that
lord
baltimore
s
toleration
act
of
was
the
bright
dawn
that
ushered
in
the
sun
of
freedom
in
and
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
proprietary
s
charter
of
liberty
with
its
attendant
blessings
served
as
an
example
an
incentive
and
an
inspiration
to
some
at
least
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
to
extend
over
the
new
republic
the
precious
boon
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
it
is
proper
to
also
observe
that
the
act
of
was
not
a
new
declaration
of
religious
freedom
on
the
part
of
lord
baltimore
s
administration
but
was
a
solemn
affirmation
of
the
toleration
granted
by
the
catholic
proprietary
from
the
beginning
of
the
settlement
in
i
will
close
this
subject
in
the
words
of
a
distinguished
member
of
the
maryland
historical
society
higher
than
all
titles
and
badges
of
honor
and
more
exalted
than
royal
nobility
is
the
imperishable
distinction
which
the
passage
of
this
broad
and
liberal
act
won
for
maryland
and
for
the
members
of
that
session
and
sacred
forever
be
the
hallowed
spot
which
gave
it
what
shall
i
say
of
the
prominent
part
that
was
taken
by
distinguished
representatives
of
the
catholic
church
in
the
cause
of
our
american
independence
what
shall
i
say
of
charles
carroll
of
carrollton
who
at
the
risk
of
sacrificing
his
rich
estates
signed
the
declaration
of
independence
of
rev
john
carroll
afterward
the
first
archbishop
of
baltimore
who
with
his
cousin
charles
carroll
and
benjamin
franklin
was
sent
by
congress
to
canada
to
secure
the
of
the
people
of
that
province
in
the
struggle
for
liberty
of
kosciusko
lafayette
pulaski
barry
and
a
host
of
other
catholic
heroes
who
labored
so
effectually
in
the
same
glorious
cause
american
patriots
without
number
the
church
has
nursed
in
her
bosom
a
traitor
never
the
father
of
his
country
was
not
unmindful
of
these
services
shortly
after
his
election
to
the
presidency
replying
to
an
address
of
his
catholic
he
uses
the
following
language
i
presume
that
your
will
not
forget
the
patriotic
part
which
you
took
in
the
accomplishment
of
their
revolution
and
the
establishment
of
their
government
or
the
important
assistance
they
received
from
a
nation
in
which
the
roman
catholic
faith
is
and
the
catholics
of
our
generation
have
nobly
emulated
the
patriotism
and
the
spirit
of
toleration
exhibited
by
their
ancestors
they
can
neither
be
accused
of
disloyalty
nor
of
intolerance
to
their
dissenting
brethren
in
more
than
one
instance
of
our
nation
s
history
our
churches
have
been
desecrated
and
burned
to
the
ground
our
convents
have
been
invaded
and
destroyed
our
clergy
have
been
exposed
to
insult
and
violence
these
injuries
have
been
inflicted
on
us
by
incendiary
mobs
animated
by
hatred
of
catholicism
yet
in
spite
of
these
provocations
our
catholic
citizens
though
wielding
an
immense
numerical
influence
in
the
localities
where
they
suffered
have
never
retaliated
it
is
in
a
spirit
of
just
pride
that
we
can
affirm
that
hitherto
in
the
united
states
no
protestant
house
of
worship
or
educational
institution
has
been
destroyed
nor
violence
offered
to
a
protestant
minister
by
those
who
profess
the
catholic
faith
god
grant
that
such
may
always
be
our
record
it
is
just
because
the
church
has
ever
resisted
the
tyranny
of
kings
in
their
encroachments
on
the
sacred
rights
of
conscience
that
she
has
always
been
the
victim
of
royal
persecution
in
every
age
in
the
language
of
the
psalmist
the
kings
of
the
earth
rose
up
and
the
princes
assembled
together
against
the
lord
and
against
his
the
brightest
and
most
thrilling
pages
of
ecclesiastical
history
are
those
which
record
the
sufferings
of
popes
and
prelates
at
the
hands
of
temporal
sovereigns
for
conscience
and
for
justice
sake
take
for
instance
john
chrysostom
the
great
archbishop
of
constantinople
in
the
fifth
century
and
the
idol
of
the
people
he
had
the
courage
like
john
the
baptist
to
raise
his
eloquent
voice
against
the
lasciviousness
of
the
court
and
particularly
against
the
empress
eudoxia
who
ruled
like
another
jezabel
he
was
banished
from
his
see
treated
with
the
utmost
indignity
by
the
soldiers
and
died
in
exile
from
sheer
exhaustion
and
witness
pope
gregory
the
fearless
hildebrand
in
his
struggle
with
the
german
emperor
henry
iv
gregory
directed
all
the
energies
of
his
great
mind
towards
reforming
the
abuses
which
had
crept
into
the
church
of
france
and
germany
in
the
eleventh
century
in
those
days
the
emperor
of
germany
assumed
the
right
of
naming
or
appointing
bishops
throughout
his
empire
this
sacred
office
was
commonly
bestowed
on
very
unworthy
candidates
and
very
often
put
up
at
auction
to
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
as
is
now
the
case
with
the
schismatic
greek
church
in
turkey
these
bishops
too
often
repaid
their
imperial
benefactor
by
pandering
to
his
passions
and
by
the
most
servile
flattery
the
intrepid
pope
partially
succeeded
in
uprooting
the
evil
though
the
effort
cost
him
his
life
the
emperor
invaded
rome
and
drove
gregory
from
his
see
who
died
uttering
these
words
with
his
last
breath
i
have
loved
justice
and
hated
iniquity
and
therefore
i
die
in
for
the
same
cause
thomas
à
becket
archbishop
of
canterbury
was
slain
at
the
altar
by
the
hired
assassins
of
henry
of
england
observe
how
pius
vii
was
treated
by
the
first
napoleon
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
the
of
napoleon
was
to
be
master
of
europe
and
to
place
his
brothers
and
friends
on
the
thrones
of
the
continent
that
they
might
revolve
like
so
many
satellites
around
his
throne
in
france
napoleon
makes
two
demands
on
the
venerable
pontiff
he
dissolve
the
marriage
which
had
been
contracted
between
the
emperor
s
brother
jerome
and
miss
patterson
of
baltimore
his
ostensible
reason
for
having
the
marriage
dissolved
was
because
miss
patterson
was
a
protestant
but
his
real
motive
was
to
secure
a
royal
bride
for
his
brother
instead
of
an
american
lady
he
close
his
ports
against
the
commerce
of
england
with
which
nation
napoleon
was
then
at
war
and
make
common
cause
with
the
emperor
against
his
enemies
the
pope
rejected
both
demands
he
told
the
emperor
that
the
church
held
all
marriages
performed
by
her
as
indissoluble
even
when
one
of
the
parties
was
not
a
catholic
and
that
as
the
common
father
of
christendom
he
could
close
his
port
against
no
christian
power
for
refusing
to
comply
with
this
second
demand
the
pope
was
arrested
and
sent
into
exile
where
he
lingered
for
years
at
this
very
moment
the
old
conflict
between
the
church
and
despotic
governments
is
raging
fiercely
throughout
europe
the
scene
enacted
by
john
and
herod
is
today
reproduced
in
almost
every
kingdom
of
the
old
world
it
is
the
old
fight
between
brute
force
and
the
rights
of
conscience
in
russia
we
see
the
bishop
of
plock
exiled
for
life
from
his
see
to
siberia
his
only
offence
is
his
refusal
to
acknowledge
that
the
emperor
alexander
is
the
head
of
the
christian
church
if
we
pass
over
into
italy
we
see
religious
men
and
women
driven
from
their
homes
their
houses
and
libraries
which
pious
and
learned
men
had
been
collecting
and
consulting
for
ages
the
only
crime
of
those
religious
is
that
they
have
not
the
power
to
resist
brute
force
cross
the
alps
into
france
and
there
you
will
see
that
monster
the
commune
assassinating
the
archbishop
of
paris
and
his
clergy
solely
because
he
and
they
were
the
representatives
of
law
and
order
in
the
republic
of
switzerland
bishop
mermillod
is
expelled
from
geneva
without
the
slightest
charge
adduced
against
his
character
as
a
citizen
and
a
christian
prelate
faithful
clergymen
are
deprived
by
the
government
of
their
parochial
rights
and
renegade
priests
are
intruded
in
their
place
the
shepherd
is
driven
away
and
wolves
lay
waste
the
fold
go
to
prussia
what
do
you
behold
there
a
prime
minister
flushed
with
his
recent
victories
over
france
he
is
not
content
with
seeing
his
master
wear
the
imperial
crown
of
germany
he
wants
him
to
wear
also
the
tiara
of
the
pope
bismarck
like
aman
the
minister
of
king
assuerus
is
not
satisfied
with
being
second
in
the
kingdom
so
long
as
mardochai
that
is
the
church
refuses
to
bow
down
and
worship
him
he
fines
the
venerable
archbishop
of
and
other
prussian
prelates
again
and
again
sells
their
furniture
and
finally
sends
them
to
prison
for
a
protracted
period
john
chrysostom
beautifully
remarks
that
paul
elevated
to
the
third
heaven
was
glorious
to
contemplate
but
that
far
more
glorious
is
paul
buried
in
the
dungeons
of
rome
i
can
say
in
like
manner
of
archbishop
ledochowski
of
posen
that
he
was
conspicuous
in
the
vatican
council
among
his
peers
but
he
was
still
more
conspicuous
sitting
solitary
in
his
prussian
prison
the
loyalty
of
the
prussian
clergy
is
above
reproach
the
bishops
are
imprisoned
because
they
insist
on
the
right
of
educating
students
for
the
ministry
ordaining
and
appointing
clergy
without
consulting
the
government
they
are
denied
a
right
which
in
this
country
is
possessed
by
free
masons
and
every
other
human
organization
in
the
land
perhaps
a
simple
illustration
will
present
to
you
in
a
clearer
light
the
odious
character
of
the
penal
laws
to
which
i
have
alluded
suppose
the
government
of
the
united
states
were
to
issue
a
general
order
requiring
the
clergy
of
the
various
christian
denominations
to
be
educated
in
government
establishments
forcing
them
to
take
an
oath
before
entering
on
the
duties
of
the
ministry
and
forbidding
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
to
appoint
or
remove
any
clergyman
without
permission
of
the
civil
power
at
washington
would
not
the
american
people
rise
up
in
their
might
before
they
would
submit
to
have
fetters
so
galling
forged
on
their
conscience
and
yet
this
is
precisely
the
odious
legislation
which
the
prussian
government
is
enacting
against
the
church
and
the
catholic
church
in
resisting
these
laws
is
not
only
fighting
her
own
battles
but
she
is
contending
for
the
principle
of
freedom
of
conscience
everywhere
but
thank
god
we
live
in
a
country
where
liberty
of
conscience
is
respected
and
where
the
civil
constitution
holds
over
us
the
ægis
of
her
protection
without
intermeddling
with
ecclesiastical
affairs
from
my
heart
i
say
america
with
all
thy
faults
i
love
thee
still
perhaps
at
this
moment
there
is
no
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
where
the
church
is
less
trammelled
and
where
she
has
more
liberty
to
carry
out
her
sublime
destiny
than
in
these
united
states
for
my
part
i
much
prefer
the
system
which
prevails
in
this
country
where
the
temporal
needs
of
the
church
are
supplied
by
voluntary
contributions
of
the
faithful
to
the
system
which
obtains
in
some
catholic
countries
of
europe
where
the
church
is
supported
by
the
government
thereby
making
feeble
reparation
for
the
gross
injustice
it
has
done
to
the
church
by
its
former
wholesale
confiscation
of
ecclesiastical
property
and
the
church
pays
dearly
for
this
indemnity
for
she
has
to
bear
the
perpetual
attempts
at
interference
and
the
vexatious
enactments
of
the
civil
power
which
aims
at
making
her
wholly
dependent
upon
itself
some
years
ago
on
my
return
from
rome
in
company
with
the
late
archbishop
spalding
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
bishop
of
annecy
in
savoy
i
was
struck
by
the
splendor
of
his
palace
and
saw
a
sentinel
at
the
door
placed
there
by
the
french
government
as
a
guard
of
honor
but
the
venerable
bishop
soon
disabused
me
of
my
favorable
impressions
he
told
me
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
gilded
slavery
i
can
not
said
he
build
as
much
as
a
sacristy
without
obtaining
permission
of
the
government
i
do
not
wish
to
see
the
day
when
the
church
will
invoke
or
receive
any
government
aid
to
build
our
churches
or
to
pay
the
salary
of
our
clergy
for
the
government
may
then
begin
to
dictate
to
us
what
doctrines
we
ought
to
preach
if
it
is
a
great
wrong
to
muzzle
the
press
it
is
a
greater
wrong
to
muzzle
the
pulpit
no
amount
of
state
subsidy
would
compensate
for
the
evils
resulting
from
the
government
censorship
of
the
gospel
and
the
suppression
of
apostolic
freedom
in
proclaiming
it
paul
exults
in
the
declaration
that
though
he
is
personally
in
chains
the
word
of
god
is
not
enchained
and
moreover
in
proportion
as
state
patronage
would
increase
the
sympathy
and
aid
of
the
faithful
would
diminish
may
the
happy
condition
of
things
now
existing
among
us
always
continue
in
which
the
relations
between
the
clergy
and
the
people
will
be
direct
and
immediate
in
which
bishops
and
priests
will
bestow
upon
their
spiritual
children
their
voluntary
labors
their
tender
solicitude
their
paternal
affection
and
pour
out
like
water
their
hearts
blood
if
necessary
and
in
which
they
will
receive
in
return
the
devotion
and
gratitude
of
a
filial
people
chapter

charges
of
religious
persecution
i
the
spanish
inquisition
but
did
not
the
spanish
inquisition
exercise
enormous
cruelties
against
heretics
and
jews
i
am
not
the
apologist
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
i
have
no
desire
to
palliate
or
excuse
the
excesses
into
which
that
tribunal
may
at
times
have
fallen
from
my
heart
i
abhor
and
denounce
every
species
of
violence
and
injustice
and
persecution
of
which
the
spanish
inquisition
may
have
been
guilty
and
in
raising
my
voice
against
coercion
for
conscience
sake
i
am
expressing
not
only
my
own
sentiments
but
those
of
every
catholic
priest
and
layman
in
the
land
our
catholic
ancestors
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
have
suffered
so
much
for
freedom
of
conscience
that
they
would
rise
up
in
judgment
against
us
were
we
to
become
the
advocates
and
defenders
of
religious
persecution
we
would
be
a
disgrace
to
our
sires
were
we
to
trample
on
the
principle
of
liberty
which
they
held
dearer
than
life
when
i
denounce
the
cruelties
of
the
inquisition
i
am
not
standing
aloof
from
the
church
but
i
am
treading
in
her
footprints
bloodshed
and
persecution
form
no
part
of
the
creed
of
the
catholic
church
so
much
does
she
abhor
the
shedding
of
blood
that
a
man
becomes
disqualified
to
serve
as
a
minister
at
her
altars
who
by
act
or
counsel
voluntarily
sheds
the
blood
of
another
before
you
can
convict
the
church
of
intolerance
you
must
first
bring
forward
some
authentic
act
of
her
popes
or
councils
sanctioning
the
policy
of
vengeance
in
all
my
readings
i
have
yet
to
find
one
decree
of
hers
advocating
torture
or
death
for
conscience
sake
she
is
indeed
intolerant
of
error
but
her
only
weapons
against
error
are
those
pointed
out
by
paul
to
timothy
preach
the
word
be
instant
in
season
out
of
season
reprove
entreat
rebuke
with
all
patience
and
but
you
will
tell
me
were
not
the
authors
of
the
inquisition
children
of
the
church
and
did
they
not
exercise
their
enormities
in
her
name
granted
but
i
ask
you
is
it
just
or
fair
to
hold
the
church
responsible
for
those
acts
of
her
children
which
she
disowns
you
do
not
denounce
liberty
as
mockery
because
many
crimes
are
committed
in
her
name
neither
do
you
hold
a
father
accountable
for
the
sins
of
his
disobedient
children
we
should
also
bear
in
mind
that
the
spaniards
were
not
the
only
people
who
have
proscribed
men
for
the
exercise
of
their
religious
belief
if
we
calmly
study
the
history
of
other
nations
our
enmity
towards
spain
will
considerably
relax
and
we
shall
have
to
reserve
for
her
neighbors
a
portion
of
our
indignation
no
impartial
student
of
history
will
deny
that
the
leaders
of
the
reformed
religions
whenever
they
gained
the
ascendency
exercised
violence
toward
those
who
differed
from
them
in
faith
i
mention
this
not
by
way
of
recrimination
nor
in
palliation
of
the
proscriptions
of
the
spanish
government
for
one
offence
is
not
justified
by
another
my
object
is
merely
to
show
that
they
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
stones
and
that
it
is
not
honest
to
make
spain
the
scapegoat
bearing
alone
on
her
shoulders
the
odium
of
religious
intolerance
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
john
calvin
burned
michael
servetus
at
the
stake
for
heresy
that
the
not
only
avowed
but
also
justified
the
deed
in
his
writings
and
that
he
established
in
geneva
an
inquisition
for
the
punishment
of
refractory
christians
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
luther
advocated
the
most
merciless
doctrine
towards
the
jews
according
to
his
apologist
seckendorf
the
german
reformer
said
that
their
synagogues
ought
to
be
destroyed
their
houses
pulled
down
their
and
even
the
books
of
the
old
testament
to
be
taken
from
them
their
rabbis
ought
to
be
forbidden
to
teach
and
be
compelled
to
gain
their
livelihood
by
hard
labor
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
henry
viii
and
his
successors
for
many
generations
inflicted
fines
imprisonment
and
death
on
thousands
of
their
subjects
for
denying
the
spiritual
supremacy
of
the
temporal
sovereign
this
galling
inquisition
lasted
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
and
the
severity
of
its
decrees
scarcely
finds
a
parallel
in
the
spanish
inquisition
prescott
avows
that
the
administration
of
elizabeth
was
not
a
whit
less
despotic
and
scarcely
less
sanguinary
than
that
of
isabella
the
clergy
of
ireland
under
cromwell
were
ordered
under
pain
of
death
to
quit
their
country
and
theological
students
were
obliged
to
pursue
their
studies
in
foreign
seminaries
any
priest
who
dared
to
return
to
his
native
country
forfeited
his
life
whoever
harbored
a
priest
suffered
death
and
they
who
knew
his
and
did
not
reveal
it
to
the
inquisitors
had
both
their
ears
cut
off
at
this
very
moment
not
only
in
england
but
in
ireland
scotland
and
holland
protestants
are
worshiping
in
some
of
the
churches
erected
by
the
piety
of
our
catholic
forefathers
and
wrested
from
them
by
violence
observe
also
that
in
all
these
instances
the
persecutions
were
inflicted
by
the
express
authority
of
the
and
of
protestant
churches
the
puritans
of
new
england
inflicted
summary
vengeance
on
those
who
were
rash
enough
to
differ
from
them
in
religion
in
massachusetts
the
quakers
were
whipped
branded
had
their
ears
cut
off
their
tongues
bored
with
hot
irons
and
were
banished
upon
pain
of
death
in
case
of
their
return
and
actually
executed
upon
the
who
is
ignorant
of
the
number
of
innocent
creatures
that
suffered
death
in
the
same
state
on
the
ridiculous
charge
of
witchcraft
toward
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
well
does
it
become
their
descendants
to
taunt
catholics
with
the
horrors
of
the
spanish
inquisition
in
the
religious
riots
of
philadelphia
in
catholic
churches
were
burned
down
in
the
name
of
protestantism
and
private
houses
were
sacked
i
was
informed
by
an
eyewitness
that
owners
of
houses
were
obliged
to
mark
on
their
doors
these
words
house
belongs
to
in
order
to
save
their
property
from
the
infuriated
incendiaries
for
these
acts
i
never
heard
of
any
retaliation
on
the
part
of
catholics
and
i
hope
i
never
shall
no
matter
how
formidable
may
be
their
numbers
and
tempting
the
provocation
in
spite
of
the
boasted
toleration
of
our
times
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
still
lurks
a
spirit
of
inquisition
which
does
not
indeed
vent
itself
in
physical
violence
but
is
nevertheless
most
galling
to
its
victims
how
many
persons
have
i
met
in
the
course
of
my
ministry
who
were
ostracized
by
their
kindred
and
friends
driven
from
home
nay
disinherited
by
their
parents
for
the
sole
crime
of
carrying
out
the
very
shibboleth
of
exercise
of
private
judgment
and
of
obeying
the
dictates
of
their
conscience
by
embracing
the
catholic
faith
is
not
this
the
most
exquisite
torture
that
can
be
inflicted
on
refined
natures
ah
there
is
an
imprisonment
more
lonely
than
the
dungeon
it
is
the
imprisonment
of
our
most
cherished
thoughts
in
our
own
hearts
without
a
member
of
the
family
with
whom
to
communicate
there
is
a
sword
more
keen
than
the
executioner
s
knife
it
is
the
envenomed
tongue
of
obloquy
and
abuse
there
is
a
banishment
less
tolerable
than
exile
from
one
s
country
it
is
the
excommunication
from
the
parental
roof
and
from
the
affections
of
those
we
love
have
i
a
right
to
hold
the
members
of
the
episcopal
lutheran
presbyterian
and
congregationalist
churches
responsible
for
these
proscriptive
measures
to
which
i
have
referred
most
of
which
have
been
authorized
by
their
respective
founders
and
leaders
god
forbid
i
know
full
well
that
these
acts
of
cruelty
form
no
part
of
the
creed
of
the
protestant
churches
i
have
been
acquainted
with
protestants
from
my
youth
they
have
been
among
my
most
intimate
and
cherished
friends
and
from
my
knowledge
of
them
i
am
convinced
that
they
would
discountenance
any
physical
violence
which
would
be
inflicted
on
their
on
account
of
their
religious
convictions
they
would
justly
tell
me
that
the
persecutions
of
former
years
of
which
i
have
spoken
should
be
ascribed
to
the
peculiar
and
unhappy
state
of
society
in
which
their
ancestors
lived
rather
than
to
the
inherent
principles
of
their
religion
for
precisely
the
same
reasons
and
for
reasons
still
more
forcible
protestants
should
not
reproach
the
catholic
church
for
the
atrocities
of
the
spanish
inquisition
the
persecutions
to
which
i
have
alluded
were
for
the
most
part
perpetrated
by
the
founders
and
heads
of
the
protestant
churches
while
the
rigors
of
the
spanish
tribunal
were
inflicted
by
laymen
and
subordinate
ecclesiastics
either
without
the
knowledge
or
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
the
bishops
of
rome
let
us
now
present
the
inquisition
in
its
true
light
in
the
first
place
the
number
of
its
victims
has
been
wildly
exaggerated
as
even
prescott
is
forced
to
admit
the
popular
historian
of
the
inquisition
is
llorente
from
whom
our
american
authors
generally
derive
their
information
on
this
subject
now
who
was
llorente
he
was
a
degraded
priest
who
was
dismissed
from
the
board
of
inquisitors
of
which
he
had
been
secretary
actuated
by
interest
and
revenge
he
wrote
his
history
at
the
instance
of
joseph
bonaparte
the
new
king
of
spain
and
to
please
his
royal
master
he
did
all
he
could
to
blacken
the
character
of
that
institution
his
testimony
therefore
should
be
received
with
great
reserve
to
give
you
one
instance
of
his
unreliability
he
quotes
the
historian
mariana
as
his
authority
for
saying
that
two
thousand
persons
were
put
to
death
in
one
year
in
the
dioceses
of
seville
and
cadiz
alone
by
referring
to
the
pages
of
mariana
we
find
that
author
saying
that
two
thousand
were
put
to
death
all
spain
during
the
entire
administration
of
torquemada
which
embraced
a
period
of
fifteen
before
beginning
to
examine
the
character
of
this
tribunal
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
the
spanish
inquisition
was
not
a
purely
ecclesiastical
institution
but
a
mixed
tribunal
it
was
conceived
systematized
regulated
in
all
its
procedures
and
judgments
equipped
with
officers
and
powers
and
its
executions
fines
and
confiscations
were
carried
out
by
the
royal
authority
alone
and
not
by
the
church
to
understand
the
true
character
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
the
motives
which
prompted
king
ferdinand
in
establishing
that
tribunal
we
must
take
a
glance
at
the
internal
condition
of
spain
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
after
a
struggle
of
eight
centuries
the
spanish
nation
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
moors
and
in
planting
the
national
flag
over
the
entire
country
at
last
the
cross
conquered
the
crescent
and
christianity
triumphed
over
mahometanism
the
empire
was
consolidated
under
the
joint
reign
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
but
there
still
remained
elements
of
discord
in
the
nation
the
population
was
composed
of
three
conflicting
spaniards
moors
and
jews
perhaps
the
difficulties
which
beset
our
own
government
in
its
efforts
to
harmonize
the
white
the
indian
and
the
colored
population
will
give
us
some
idea
of
the
formidable
obstacles
with
which
the
spanish
court
had
to
contend
in
its
efforts
to
cement
into
one
compact
nation
a
conquering
and
a
conquered
people
of
different
race
and
religion
the
jews
and
the
moors
were
disaffected
toward
the
spanish
government
not
only
on
political
but
also
on
religious
grounds
they
were
suspected
and
not
unjustly
of
desiring
to
transfer
their
allegiance
from
the
king
of
spain
to
the
king
of
barbary
or
to
the
grand
turk
the
spanish
inquisition
was
accordingly
erected
by
king
ferdinand
less
from
motives
of
religious
zeal
than
from
those
of
human
policy
it
was
established
not
so
much
with
the
view
of
preserving
the
catholic
faith
as
of
perpetuating
the
integrity
of
his
kingdom
the
moors
and
jews
were
looked
upon
not
only
as
enemies
of
the
altar
but
chiefly
as
enemies
of
the
throne
catholics
were
upheld
not
for
their
faith
alone
but
because
they
united
faith
to
loyalty
the
baptized
moors
and
israelites
were
oppressed
for
their
heresy
because
their
heresy
was
allied
to
sedition
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
heresy
especially
if
outspoken
was
regarded
not
only
as
an
offence
against
religion
but
also
as
a
crime
against
the
state
and
was
punished
accordingly
this
condition
of
things
was
not
confined
to
catholic
spain
but
prevailed
across
the
sea
in
protestant
england
we
find
henry
viii
and
his
successors
pursuing
the
same
policy
in
great
britain
toward
their
catholic
subjects
and
punishing
catholicism
as
a
crime
against
the
state
just
as
islamism
and
judaism
were
proscribed
in
spain
it
was
therefore
rather
a
royal
and
political
than
an
ecclesiastical
institution
the
king
nominated
the
inquisitors
who
were
equally
composed
of
lay
and
clerical
officials
he
dismissed
them
at
will
from
the
king
and
not
from
the
pope
they
derived
their
jurisdiction
and
into
the
king
s
coffers
and
not
into
the
pope
s
went
all
the
emoluments
accruing
from
fines
and
confiscations
in
a
word
the
authority
of
the
inquisition
began
and
ended
with
the
crown
in
confirmation
of
these
assertions
i
shall
quote
from
ranke
a
german
protestant
historian
who
can
not
be
suspected
of
partiality
to
the
catholic
church
in
the
first
place
says
this
author
the
inquisitors
were
royal
officers
the
kings
had
the
right
of
appointing
and
dismissing
them
the
courts
of
the
inquisition
were
subject
like
other
magistracies
to
royal
visitors
do
you
not
know
said
the
king
to
ximenes
that
if
this
tribunal
possesses
jurisdiction
it
is
from
the
king
it
derives
it
in
the
second
place
all
the
profit
of
the
confiscations
by
this
court
accrued
to
the
king
these
were
carried
out
in
a
very
unsparing
manner
though
the
privileges
of
aragon
forbade
the
king
to
confiscate
the
property
of
his
convicted
subjects
he
deemed
himself
exalted
above
the
law
in
matters
pertaining
to
this
court
the
proceeds
of
these
confiscations
formed
a
sort
of
regular
income
for
the
royal
exchequer
it
was
even
believed
and
asserted
from
the
beginning
that
the
kings
had
been
moved
to
establish
and
countenance
this
tribunal
more
by
their
hankering
after
the
wealth
it
confiscated
than
by
motives
of
piety
in
the
third
place
it
was
the
inquisition
and
the
inquisition
alone
that
completely
shut
out
all
extraneous
interference
with
the
state
the
sovereign
had
now
at
his
disposal
a
tribunal
from
which
no
grandee
no
archbishop
could
withdraw
himself
as
charles
knew
no
other
means
of
bringing
certain
punishment
on
the
bishops
who
had
taken
part
in
the
insurrection
of
the
or
communes
who
were
struggling
for
their
rights
and
liberties
he
chose
to
have
them
judged
by
the
inquisition
it
was
in
spirit
and
tendency
a
political
institution
pope
had
an
interest
in
thwarting
it
and
he
did
but
the
king
had
an
interest
in
constantly
upholding
that
the
inquisition
acted
independently
of
the
holy
see
and
that
even
the
catholic
hierarchy
fell
under
the
ban
of
this
royal
tribunal
is
also
apparent
from
the
following
fact
after
the
convening
of
the
council
of
trent
bartholomew
caranza
archbishop
of
toledo
was
arrested
by
the
inquisition
on
a
charge
of
heresy
and
his
release
from
prison
could
not
be
obtained
either
by
the
interposition
of
pius
iv
or
the
remonstrance
of
the
council
it
is
true
that
sixtus
yielding
to
the
importunities
of
queen
isabella
consented
to
its
establishment
being
advised
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
order
in
the
kingdom
but
in
the
year
following
its
introduction
when
the
jews
complained
to
him
of
its
severity
the
same
pontiff
issued
a
bull
against
the
inquisitors
as
prescott
informs
us
in
which
he
rebuked
their
intemperate
zeal
and
even
threatened
them
with
he
wrote
to
ferdinand
and
isabella
that
mercy
towards
the
guilty
was
more
pleasing
to
god
than
the
severity
which
they
were
when
the
pope
could
not
eradicate
the
evil
he
encouraged
the
sufferers
to
flee
to
rome
where
they
found
an
asylum
and
where
he
took
the
fugitives
under
his
protection
in
two
years
he
received
four
hundred
and
fifty
refugees
from
spain
did
the
pontiff
send
them
back
or
did
he
inflict
vengeance
on
them
at
home
far
from
it
they
were
restored
to
all
the
rights
of
citizens
how
can
we
imagine
that
the
pope
would
encourage
in
spain
the
legalized
murder
of
men
whom
he
protected
from
violence
in
his
own
city
where
he
might
have
crushed
them
with
impunity
i
can
find
no
authenticated
instance
of
any
pope
putting
to
death
in
his
own
dominions
a
single
individual
for
his
religious
belief
moreover
sometimes
the
pope
when
he
could
not
reach
the
victims
censured
and
excommunicated
the
inquisitor
and
protected
the
children
of
those
whose
property
was
confiscated
to
the
crown
after
a
struggle
he
succeeded
in
preventing
the
spanish
government
from
establishing
its
inquisition
in
naples
or
milan
which
then
belonged
to
spain
so
great
was
his
abhorence
of
its
cruelties
to
sum
up
i
have
endeavored
to
show
that
the
church
disavows
all
responsibility
for
the
excesses
of
the
spanish
inquisition
because
oppression
forms
no
part
of
her
creed
that
these
atrocities
have
been
grossly
exaggerated
that
the
inquisition
was
a
political
tribunal
that
catholic
prelates
were
amenable
to
its
sentence
as
well
as
moors
and
jews
and
that
the
popes
denounced
and
labored
hard
to
abolish
its
sanguinary
features
and
yet
rome
has
to
bear
all
the
odium
of
the
inquisition
i
heartily
pray
that
religious
intolerance
may
never
take
root
in
our
favored
land
may
the
only
king
to
force
our
conscience
be
the
king
of
kings
may
the
only
prison
erected
among
us
for
the
sin
of
unbelief
or
misbelief
be
the
prison
of
a
troubled
conscience
and
may
our
only
motive
for
embracing
truth
be
not
the
fear
of
man
but
the
love
of
truth
and
of
god
ii
what
about
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
i
have
no
words
strong
enough
to
express
my
detestation
of
that
inhuman
slaughter
it
is
true
that
the
number
of
its
victims
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
by
partisan
writers
but
that
is
no
extenuation
of
the
crime
itself
i
most
emphatically
assert
that
the
church
had
no
act
or
part
in
this
atrocious
butchery
except
to
deplore
the
event
and
weep
over
its
unhappy
victims
here
are
the
facts
briefly
presented
the
reign
of
charles
ix
of
france
the
huguenots
were
a
formidable
power
and
a
seditious
element
in
that
country
they
were
under
the
leadership
of
admiral
coligny
who
was
plotting
the
overthrow
of
the
ruling
monarch
the
french
king
instigated
by
his
mother
catherine
de
medicis
and
fearing
the
influence
of
coligny
whom
he
regarded
as
an
aspirant
to
the
throne
compassed
his
assassination
as
well
as
that
of
his
followers
in
paris
august
this
deed
of
violence
was
followed
by
an
indiscriminate
massacre
in
the
french
capital
and
other
cities
of
france
by
an
incendiary
populace
who
are
easily
aroused
but
not
easily
appeased
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
massacre
coligny
and
his
fellow
huguenots
were
slain
not
on
account
of
their
creed
but
exclusively
on
account
of
their
alleged
treasonable
designs
if
they
had
nothing
but
their
protestant
faith
to
render
them
odious
to
king
charles
they
would
never
have
been
molested
for
neither
did
charles
nor
his
mother
ever
manifest
any
special
zeal
for
the
catholic
church
nor
any
special
aversion
to
protestantism
unless
when
it
threatened
the
throne
after
the
massacre
charles
despatched
an
envoy
extraordinary
to
each
of
the
courts
of
europe
conveying
the
startling
intelligence
that
the
king
and
royal
family
had
narrowly
escaped
from
a
horrible
conspiracy
and
that
its
authors
had
been
detected
and
summarily
punished
the
envoys
in
their
narration
carefully
suppressed
any
allusion
to
the
indiscriminate
massacre
which
had
taken
place
but
announced
the
event
in
the
following
words
on
that
memorable
night
by
the
destruction
of
a
few
seditious
men
the
king
had
been
delivered
from
immediate
danger
of
death
and
the
realm
from
the
perpetual
terror
of
civil
pope
gregory
to
whom
also
an
envoy
was
sent
acting
on
this
garbled
information
ordered
a
te
deum
to
be
sung
and
a
commemorative
medal
to
be
struck
in
thanksgiving
to
god
not
for
the
massacre
of
which
he
was
utterly
ignorant
but
for
the
preservation
of
the
french
king
from
an
untimely
and
violent
death
and
of
the
french
nation
from
the
horrors
of
a
civil
war
sismondi
a
protestant
historian
tells
us
that
the
pope
s
nuncio
in
paris
was
purposely
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
designs
of
charles
and
ranke
in
his
of
the
civil
informs
us
that
charles
and
his
mother
suddenly
left
paris
in
order
to
avoid
an
interview
with
the
pope
s
legate
who
arrived
soon
after
the
massacre
their
guilty
conscience
fearing
no
doubt
a
rebuke
from
the
messenger
of
the
vicar
of
christ
from
whom
the
real
facts
were
not
long
concealed
is
scarcely
necessary
to
vindicate
the
innocence
of
the
bishops
and
clergy
of
france
in
this
transaction
as
no
author
how
hostile
soever
to
the
church
has
ever
to
my
knowledge
accused
them
of
any
complicity
in
the
heinous
massacre
on
the
contrary
they
used
their
best
efforts
to
arrest
the
progress
of
the
assailants
to
prevent
further
bloodshed
and
to
protect
the
lives
of
the
fugitives
more
than
three
hundred
calvinists
were
sheltered
from
the
assassins
by
taking
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
archbishop
of
lyons
the
bishops
of
lisieux
bordeaux
toulouse
and
of
other
cities
offered
similar
protection
to
those
who
sought
safety
in
their
homes
thus
we
see
that
the
church
slept
in
tranquil
ignorance
of
the
stormy
scene
until
she
was
aroused
to
a
knowledge
of
the
tempest
by
the
sudden
uproar
it
created
like
her
divine
spouse
on
the
troubled
waters
she
presents
herself
only
to
say
to
them
peace
be
iii
mary
queen
of
england
i
am
asked
you
not
admit
that
mary
queen
of
england
persecuted
the
protestants
of
the
british
i
ask
this
question
in
reply
is
it
that
catholics
are
persistently
reproached
for
the
persecutions
under
mary
s
reign
while
scarcely
a
voice
is
raised
in
condemnation
of
the
legalized
fines
confiscations
and
deaths
inflicted
on
the
catholics
of
great
britain
and
ireland
for
three
hundred
the
establishment
of
the
church
of
england
in
to
the
time
of
the
catholic
emancipation
elizabeth
s
hands
were
steeped
in
the
blood
of
catholics
puritans
and
anabaptists
why
are
these
cruelties
suppressed
or
glossed
over
while
those
of
mary
form
the
burden
of
every
nursery
tale
is
it
because
persecution
becomes
justice
when
catholics
happen
to
be
the
victims
or
is
it
because
they
are
expected
from
long
usage
to
be
insensible
to
torture
if
we
weigh
in
the
scales
of
impartial
justice
the
reigns
of
both
sisters
we
shall
be
compelled
to
bring
a
far
more
severe
verdict
against
elizabeth
reigned
only
five
years
and
four
months
elizabeth
s
reign
lasted
years
and
four
months
the
younger
sister
therefore
swayed
the
sceptre
of
authority
nearly
nine
times
longer
than
the
elder
and
the
number
of
catholics
who
suffered
for
their
faith
during
the
long
administration
of
elizabeth
may
be
safely
said
to
exceed
in
the
same
proportion
the
victims
of
mary
s
reign
hallam
asserts
that
the
rack
seldom
stood
idle
in
the
tower
for
all
the
latter
part
of
elizabeth
s
reign
and
its
very
first
month
was
stained
by
an
intolerant
statute
most
unpardonable
act
of
mary
s
life
in
the
judgment
of
her
critics
was
the
execution
of
lady
jane
grey
but
lady
jane
was
guilty
of
high
treason
having
usurped
the
throne
of
england
which
she
occupied
for
nine
days
elizabeth
put
to
death
her
cousin
mary
queen
of
scots
after
a
long
imprisonment
on
the
unsustained
charge
of
aspiring
to
the
english
throne
s
zeal
was
exercised
in
behalf
of
the
religion
of
her
forefathers
and
of
the
faith
established
in
england
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
elizabeth
s
zeal
was
employed
in
extending
the
new
creed
introduced
by
her
father
in
a
moment
of
passion
and
modified
by
herself
surely
the
coercive
enforcement
of
a
new
creed
is
more
odious
than
the
rigorous
maintenance
of
the
faith
of
a
nation
mary
therefore
insisted
on
perpetuating
the
established
order
of
things
elizabeth
on
subverting
it
elder
sister
was
propagating
what
she
believed
to
be
the
unchangeable
and
infallible
doctrines
of
jesus
christ
the
younger
sister
was
propagating
her
own
and
her
father
s
novel
and
more
or
less
uncertain
opinions
mary
had
no
private
or
personal
motives
in
oppressing
protestants
elizabeth
s
hostility
to
the
catholic
church
was
intensified
if
not
instigated
by
her
hatred
of
the
pope
who
had
declared
her
illegitimate
her
legitimacy
before
the
world
depended
on
the
success
of
the
new
religion
which
had
legalized
her
father
s
divorce
from
catherine
as
macaulay
says
mary
was
sincere
in
her
religion
elizabeth
was
not
having
no
scruple
about
conforming
to
the
romish
church
when
conformity
was
necessary
to
her
own
safety
retaining
to
the
last
moment
of
her
life
a
fondness
for
much
of
the
doctrine
and
much
of
the
ceremonial
of
that
church
she
yet
subjected
that
church
to
a
persecution
even
more
odious
than
the
persecution
with
which
her
sister
had
harassed
the
protestants
mary
did
nothing
for
her
religion
which
she
was
not
prepared
to
suffer
for
it
she
had
held
it
firmly
under
persecution
she
fully
believed
it
to
be
essential
to
salvation
elizabeth
in
opinion
was
little
more
than
half
a
protestant
she
had
professed
when
it
suited
her
to
be
wholly
a
catholic
what
can
be
said
in
defence
of
a
ruler
who
is
at
once
indifferent
and
intolerant
an
intelligent
gentleman
in
north
carolina
once
said
to
me
tauntingly
what
do
you
think
of
bloody
mary
did
you
ever
hear
i
replied
of
her
sister
s
cruelties
to
catholics
he
answered
that
he
never
read
of
that
woman
persecuting
for
conscience
sake
i
was
amazed
at
his
words
until
he
acknowledged
that
his
historical
library
was
comprised
in
one
aubigné
s
history
of
the
that
author
has
prudently
suppressed
or
delicately
touched
elizabeth
s
peccadilloes
as
not
coming
within
the
scope
of
his
plan
how
many
are
found
like
our
north
carolina
gentleman
who
are
familiar
from
their
childhood
with
the
name
of
but
who
never
once
heard
of
chapter
xix
of
baptizing
the
grace
of
god
is
that
supernatural
assistance
which
he
imparts
to
us
through
the
merits
of
jesus
christ
for
our
salvation
it
is
called
because
no
one
by
his
own
natural
ability
can
acquire
it
without
divine
grace
we
can
neither
conceive
nor
accomplish
anything
for
the
sanctification
of
our
souls
not
that
we
are
sufficient
says
the
apostle
to
think
anything
of
ourselves
as
of
ourselves
but
our
sufficiency
is
from
for
it
is
god
who
worketh
in
you
both
to
will
and
to
accomplish
anything
conducive
to
your
salvation
without
me
says
our
lord
you
can
do
but
in
order
that
divine
grace
may
effectually
aid
us
we
must
with
it
or
at
least
we
must
not
resist
it
the
grace
of
god
is
obtained
chiefly
by
prayer
and
the
sacraments
a
sacrament
is
a
visible
sign
instituted
by
christ
by
which
grace
is
conveyed
to
our
souls
three
things
are
necessary
to
constitute
a
sacrament
visible
sign
invisible
grace
and
the
institution
by
our
lord
jesus
christ
thus
in
the
sacrament
of
baptism
there
is
the
outward
sign
which
consists
in
the
pouring
of
water
and
in
the
formula
of
words
which
are
then
pronounced
the
interior
grace
or
sanctification
which
is
imparted
to
the
soul
be
baptized
and
you
shall
receive
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
ordinance
of
jesus
christ
who
said
teach
all
nations
baptizing
them
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
our
savior
instituted
seven
sacraments
namely
baptism
confirmation
eucharist
penance
extreme
unction
orders
and
matrimony
which
i
shall
explain
separately
according
to
the
teachings
of
holy
writ
man
was
created
in
a
state
of
innocence
and
holiness
and
after
having
spent
on
this
earth
his
allotted
terms
of
years
he
was
destined
without
tasting
death
to
be
translated
to
the
perpetual
society
of
god
in
heaven
but
in
consequence
of
his
disobedience
he
fell
from
his
high
estate
of
righteousness
his
soul
was
defiled
by
sin
he
became
subject
to
death
and
to
various
ills
of
body
and
soul
and
forfeited
his
heavenly
inheritance
adam
s
transgression
was
not
confined
to
himself
but
was
transmitted
with
its
long
train
of
dire
consequences
to
all
his
posterity
it
is
called
sin
because
it
is
derived
from
our
original
progenitor
wherefore
says
paul
as
by
one
man
sin
entered
into
this
world
and
by
sin
death
and
so
death
passed
unto
all
men
in
whom
all
have
and
elsewhere
he
tells
us
that
we
were
by
nature
children
of
who
says
job
can
make
him
clean
that
is
conceived
of
unclean
seed
or
as
the
septuagint
version
expresses
it
there
is
no
one
free
from
stain
not
even
though
his
life
be
of
one
as
an
infant
one
day
old
can
not
commit
an
actual
sin
the
must
come
from
the
original
offense
of
adam
behold
says
david
i
was
conceived
in
iniquities
and
in
sins
did
my
mother
conceive
the
scripture
also
tells
us
that
jeremiah
and
john
the
baptist
were
sanctified
before
their
birth
or
purified
from
sin
and
of
course
at
that
period
of
their
existence
they
were
incapable
of
actual
sin
they
were
cleansed
therefore
from
the
original
taint
these
passages
clearly
show
that
we
have
all
inherited
the
transgression
of
our
first
parents
and
that
we
are
born
enemies
of
god
and
it
is
equally
plain
that
these
texts
apply
to
every
member
of
the
human
the
infant
of
a
day
old
as
well
as
to
the
adult
indeed
even
without
the
light
of
holy
scripture
we
have
only
to
look
into
ourselves
to
be
convinced
that
our
nature
has
undergone
a
rude
shock
how
else
can
we
account
for
the
miseries
and
infirmities
of
our
bodies
the
blindness
of
our
understanding
the
perversity
of
our
always
to
evil
rather
than
to
violence
of
our
passions
which
are
constantly
waging
war
in
our
hearts
how
well
does
the
catholic
doctrine
explain
this
abnormal
state
hence
paschal
truly
says
that
man
is
a
greater
mystery
to
himself
without
original
sin
than
is
the
mystery
itself
the
church
however
declares
that
the
blessed
virgin
mary
was
exempted
from
the
stain
of
original
sin
by
the
merits
of
our
savior
jesus
christ
and
that
consequently
she
was
never
for
an
instant
subject
to
the
dominion
of
satan
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
but
god
in
passing
sentence
of
condemnation
on
adam
consoled
him
by
the
promise
of
a
redeemer
to
come
i
will
put
enmities
saith
the
lord
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
thy
seed
and
her
seed
she
shall
crush
thy
jesus
the
seed
of
mary
is
the
chosen
one
who
was
destined
to
crush
the
head
of
the
infernal
serpent
and
when
the
fulness
of
time
was
come
god
sent
his
son
made
of
a
woman
that
he
might
redeem
them
that
were
under
the
law
that
we
might
receive
the
adoption
of
jesus
christ
our
redeemer
came
to
wash
away
the
defilement
from
our
souls
and
to
restore
us
to
that
divine
friendship
which
we
had
lost
by
the
sin
of
adam
he
is
the
second
adam
who
came
to
repair
the
iniquity
of
the
first
it
was
our
savior
s
privilege
to
prescribe
the
conditions
on
which
our
reconciliation
with
god
was
to
be
effected
now
he
tells
us
in
his
gospel
that
baptism
is
the
essential
means
established
for
washing
away
the
stain
of
original
sin
and
the
door
by
which
we
find
admittance
into
his
church
which
may
be
called
the
second
eden
we
must
all
submit
to
a
new
birth
or
regeneration
before
we
can
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
water
is
the
appropriate
instrument
of
this
new
birth
as
it
indicates
the
interior
cleansing
of
the
soul
and
the
holy
ghost
the
giver
of
spiritual
life
is
its
author
the
church
teaches
that
baptism
is
necessary
for
all
for
infants
as
well
as
adults
and
her
doctrine
rests
on
the
following
grounds
our
lord
says
to
nicodemus
amen
amen
i
say
to
thee
unless
a
man
be
born
again
of
water
and
the
holy
ghost
he
can
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
these
words
embrace
the
whole
human
family
without
regard
to
age
or
sex
as
is
evident
from
the
original
greek
text
for
τις
which
is
rendered
in
our
english
translation
means
any
in
its
broadest
acceptation
the
acts
of
the
apostles
and
the
epistles
of
paul
although
containing
only
a
fragmentary
account
of
the
ministry
of
the
apostles
plainly
insinuate
that
the
apostles
baptized
children
as
well
as
grown
persons
we
are
told
for
instance
that
lydia
was
baptized
and
her
household
by
paul
and
that
the
jailer
was
baptized
and
all
his
the
same
apostle
baptized
also
the
household
of
although
it
is
not
expressly
stated
that
there
were
children
among
these
baptized
families
the
presumption
is
strongly
in
favor
of
the
supposition
that
there
were
but
if
any
doubt
exists
regarding
the
apostolic
practice
of
baptizing
infants
it
is
easily
removed
by
referring
to
the
writings
of
the
primitive
fathers
of
the
church
who
as
they
were
the
immediate
successors
of
the
apostles
ought
to
be
the
best
interpreters
of
their
doctrines
and
practice
irenæus
a
disciple
of
polycarp
who
was
a
disciple
of
john
the
evangelist
says
christ
came
to
save
all
through
himself
all
i
say
are
born
or
baptized
through
and
little
ones
boys
and
youths
and
aged
origen
who
lived
a
few
years
later
writes
the
church
received
the
tradition
from
the
apostles
to
give
baptism
even
to
the
early
church
of
africa
bears
triumphant
testimony
in
vindication
of
infant
baptism
cyprian
and
suffragan
prelates
held
a
council
in
the
metropolitan
city
of
carthage
in
the
year
while
the
council
is
in
session
a
prelate
named
fidus
writes
to
the
fathers
asking
them
whether
infants
ought
to
be
baptized
before
the
eighth
day
succeeding
their
birth
or
on
the
eighth
day
in
accordance
with
the
practice
of
circumcision
the
bishops
unanimously
subscribe
to
the
following
reply
as
to
what
regards
the
baptism
of
infants
we
all
judged
that
the
mercy
and
grace
of
god
should
be
denied
to
no
human
being
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
if
even
to
the
greatest
delinquents
the
remission
of
sins
is
granted
how
much
less
should
the
infant
be
repelled
who
being
recently
born
according
to
adam
has
contracted
at
his
first
birth
the
contagion
of
the
ancient
the
african
council
asserts
here
two
prominent
universal
contagion
of
the
human
race
through
adam
s
fall
and
the
universal
necessity
of
baptism
without
distinction
of
age
upon
this
decision
i
will
make
two
observations
did
not
inquire
about
the
necessity
of
infant
baptism
which
he
already
admitted
but
about
the
propriety
of
conferring
it
on
the
eighth
day
in
imitation
of
the
jewish
law
of
circumcision
bishops
assembled
in
that
council
were
as
numerous
as
the
whole
episcopate
of
the
united
states
which
contains
about
five
thousand
priests
and
upwards
of
six
millions
of
catholics
we
may
therefore
reasonably
conclude
that
the
judgment
of
the
african
council
represented
the
faith
of
several
thousand
priests
and
several
millions
of
catholics
augustine
commenting
on
this
decision
justly
observes
that
cyprian
and
his
colleagues
made
no
new
decree
but
maintained
most
firmly
the
faith
of
the
church
and
this
is
the
unanimous
sentiment
of
tradition
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
to
our
own
times
is
it
not
ludicrous
as
well
as
impious
to
see
a
few
german
fanatics
in
the
sixteenth
century
raising
their
feeble
voice
against
the
thunder
tones
of
all
christendom
by
decrying
a
practice
which
was
universally
held
as
sacred
and
essential
in
judging
between
the
teachings
of
apostolical
antiquity
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
anabaptists
on
the
other
it
is
not
hard
to
determine
on
which
side
lies
the
truth
for
what
becomes
of
the
christian
church
if
it
has
erred
on
so
vital
a
point
as
that
of
baptism
during
the
entire
period
of
its
existence
original
sin
as
paul
has
told
us
is
universal
every
child
is
therefore
defiled
at
its
birth
with
the
taint
of
adam
s
disobedience
now
the
scripture
says
that
nothing
defiled
can
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
hence
baptism
which
washes
away
original
sin
is
as
essential
for
the
infant
as
for
the
full
grown
man
in
order
to
attain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
said
that
regeneration
is
necessary
for
all
but
it
is
important
to
observe
that
if
a
man
is
heartily
sorry
for
his
sins
if
he
loves
god
with
his
whole
heart
if
he
desires
to
comply
with
all
the
divine
ordinances
including
baptism
but
has
no
opportunity
of
receiving
it
or
is
not
sufficiently
instructed
as
to
its
necessity
god
in
this
case
accepts
the
will
for
the
deed
should
this
man
die
in
these
dispositions
he
is
saved
by
the
of
as
happened
to
the
emperor
valentinian
who
died
a
catechuman
i
lost
him
whom
i
was
about
to
regenerate
says
ambrose
but
he
did
not
lose
that
grace
he
sought
or
if
an
unbaptized
person
lays
down
his
life
for
christ
his
death
is
accepted
as
more
than
an
equivalent
for
baptism
for
he
dies
not
only
sanctified
but
he
will
wear
a
martyr
s
crown
is
baptized
in
his
own
but
is
not
that
a
cruel
and
heartless
doctrine
which
excludes
from
heaven
so
many
harmless
babes
that
have
never
committed
any
actual
fault
to
this
i
reply
has
not
god
declared
that
baptism
is
necessary
for
all
and
is
not
god
the
supreme
wisdom
and
justice
and
mercy
i
am
sure
then
that
there
can
be
nothing
cruel
or
unjust
in
god
s
decrees
the
province
of
reason
consists
in
ascertaining
that
god
has
spoken
when
we
know
that
he
has
spoken
then
our
investigation
ceases
and
faith
and
obedience
begin
instead
of
impiously
criticising
the
divine
decree
we
should
exclaim
with
the
apostle
o
the
depth
of
the
riches
of
the
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
god
how
incomprehensible
are
his
judgments
and
how
unsearchable
his
ways
for
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
or
who
hath
been
his
counsellor
let
us
remember
that
heaven
is
a
place
to
which
none
of
us
has
any
inherent
right
or
natural
claim
but
that
it
is
promised
to
us
by
the
pure
favor
of
god
he
can
reject
and
adopt
whom
he
pleases
and
can
without
injustice
prescribe
his
own
conditions
for
accepting
his
proffered
boon
if
your
child
is
deprived
of
heaven
by
being
deprived
of
baptism
god
does
it
no
wrong
because
he
infringes
no
right
to
which
your
child
had
any
inalienable
title
if
your
child
obtains
the
grace
of
baptism
be
thankful
for
the
gift
it
is
proper
here
to
state
briefly
what
the
church
actually
teaches
regarding
the
future
state
of
unbaptized
infants
though
the
church
in
obedience
to
god
s
word
declares
that
unbaptized
infants
are
excluded
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
should
not
hence
be
concluded
that
they
are
consigned
to
the
place
of
the
reprobate
none
are
condemned
to
the
torments
of
the
damned
but
such
as
merit
divine
vengeance
by
their
personal
sins
all
that
the
church
holds
on
this
point
is
that
unregenerate
children
are
deprived
of
the
beatific
vision
or
the
possession
of
god
which
constitutes
the
essential
happiness
of
the
blessed
now
between
the
supreme
bliss
of
heaven
and
the
torments
of
the
reprobate
there
is
a
very
wide
margin
all
admit
that
the
condition
of
unbaptized
infants
is
better
than
there
are
some
catholic
writers
of
distinction
who
even
assert
that
unbaptized
infants
enjoy
a
certain
degree
of
natural
is
a
happiness
which
is
based
on
the
natural
knowledge
and
love
of
god
from
what
has
been
said
you
may
well
judge
how
reprehensible
is
the
conduct
of
catholic
parents
who
neglect
to
have
their
children
baptized
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
thereby
risking
their
own
souls
as
well
as
the
souls
of
their
innocent
offspring
how
different
was
the
practice
of
the
early
christians
who
as
augustine
testifies
hastened
with
their
babes
to
the
baptismal
font
that
they
might
not
be
deprived
of
the
grace
of
regeneration
if
an
infant
is
sick
no
expense
is
spared
that
its
life
may
be
preserved
the
physician
is
called
in
medicine
is
given
to
it
and
the
mother
will
spend
sleepless
nights
watching
every
movement
of
the
infant
she
will
sacrifice
her
repose
her
health
nay
she
will
expose
even
her
own
life
that
the
life
of
her
offspring
may
be
saved
and
yet
the
supernatural
happiness
of
the
child
is
too
often
imperiled
without
remorse
by
the
criminal
postponement
of
baptism
but
if
they
are
to
be
censured
who
are
slow
in
having
their
children
baptized
what
are
we
to
think
of
that
large
body
of
professing
christians
who
on
principle
deny
baptism
to
little
ones
till
they
come
to
the
age
of
discretion
what
are
we
to
think
of
those
who
set
their
private
opinions
above
scripture
the
early
fathers
of
the
church
and
the
universal
practice
of
christendom
we
may
smile
indeed
at
a
theological
opinion
no
matter
how
novel
or
erroneous
it
may
be
so
long
as
it
does
not
involve
any
dangerous
consequences
but
when
it
is
given
in
a
case
of
life
and
death
how
terrible
is
the
responsibility
of
those
who
propagate
doctrines
so
erroneous
the
opposite
practice
of
the
catholic
and
the
baptist
churches
in
their
treatment
of
the
newborn
infant
may
be
well
compared
to
the
conduct
of
the
true
and
the
false
mother
who
both
claimed
the
child
at
the
tribunal
of
solomon
the
king
exclaimed
divide
the
living
child
in
two
and
give
half
to
the
one
and
half
to
the
the
pretended
mother
consented
saying
let
it
be
neither
mine
nor
thine
but
divide
it
but
the
woman
whose
child
was
alive
said
to
the
king
for
her
bowels
were
moved
upon
her
child
i
beseech
thee
my
lord
give
her
the
child
alive
and
do
not
kill
while
the
baptist
church
is
willing
that
the
child
should
die
a
spiritual
death
the
true
mother
the
catholic
church
cries
out
keep
the
child
provided
its
spiritual
life
is
saved
even
at
your
hands
let
it
be
clothed
with
the
robe
of
innocence
even
by
a
stranger
let
it
be
nursed
at
the
breasts
even
of
a
better
it
should
live
without
me
than
perish
before
my
face
i
will
still
be
its
mother
though
it
know
me
not
ah
my
baptist
friend
you
think
that
baptism
is
not
necessary
for
your
child
s
salvation
the
old
church
teaches
the
contrary
you
admit
that
you
may
be
wrong
and
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
take
the
safe
side
give
your
child
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
let
it
be
baptized
baptism
washes
away
sin
and
also
actual
from
the
adult
who
may
have
contracted
them
the
cleansing
efficacy
of
baptism
was
clearly
foreshadowed
by
the
prophet
ezechiel
in
these
words
i
will
pour
upon
you
clean
water
and
you
shall
be
cleansed
from
all
your
filthiness
and
i
will
give
you
a
new
heart
and
will
put
a
new
spirit
within
when
the
jews
asked
peter
what
they
should
do
to
be
saved
the
apostle
replied
repent
and
let
everyone
of
you
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
for
the
remission
of
your
and
ananias
said
to
saul
after
his
conversion
rise
up
and
be
baptized
and
wash
away
thy
we
were
by
nature
says
paul
children
of
wrath
but
by
our
regeneration
or
new
birth
in
baptism
we
become
and
children
of
for
ye
are
all
the
children
of
god
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
for
as
many
of
you
as
have
been
baptized
in
christ
have
put
on
we
are
adopted
into
the
same
family
with
jesus
christ
what
he
is
by
nature
we
are
by
of
god
and
consequently
brethren
of
christ
nay
our
union
with
jesus
is
still
more
close
we
become
true
members
of
his
mystical
body
which
is
his
church
and
his
divine
image
is
stamped
upon
our
soul
baptism
also
clothes
us
with
the
of
so
that
our
soul
becomes
a
fit
for
the
holy
ghost
the
apostle
after
giving
a
fearful
catalogue
of
the
vices
of
the
pagans
says
to
the
corinthians
and
such
some
of
you
were
but
ye
are
washed
but
ye
are
sanctified
but
ye
are
justified
in
the
name
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
in
the
spirit
of
baptism
in
fine
makes
us
of
and
with
jesus
christ
we
ourselves
also
says
paul
were
sometimes
unwise
incredulous
erring
slaves
to
divers
desires
and
pleasures
living
in
malice
and
envy
hateful
and
hating
one
another
but
when
the
goodness
and
kindness
of
god
our
savior
appeared
he
saved
us
by
the
laver
of
regeneration
and
renovation
of
the
holy
ghost
whom
he
hath
poured
forth
abundantly
upon
us
through
jesus
christ
our
savior
that
being
justified
by
his
grace
we
may
be
heirs
according
to
the
hope
of
life
here
we
plainly
see
that
the
forgiveness
of
sin
the
adoption
into
the
family
of
god
the
sanctification
of
the
soul
and
the
pledge
of
eternal
life
are
ascribed
to
the
due
reception
of
indeed
that
water
or
the
words
of
the
minister
have
any
intrinsic
virtue
to
heal
the
soul
but
because
jesus
christ
whose
word
is
creative
power
is
pleased
to
attach
to
this
rite
its
wonderful
efficacy
of
healing
the
soul
as
he
imparted
to
the
pool
of
bethsaida
the
power
of
healing
the
body
from
what
has
been
said
i
ask
you
candidly
what
are
you
to
think
of
the
decision
rendered
in
by
the
bishops
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
who
in
their
convention
in
baltimore
declared
that
by
the
word
we
are
not
to
understand
moral
if
no
moral
change
is
effected
by
baptism
then
there
is
no
change
at
all
for
certainly
baptism
produces
no
physical
change
in
the
soul
is
it
no
change
to
pass
from
sin
to
virtue
from
a
child
of
wrath
to
be
a
child
of
god
from
corruption
to
sanctification
from
the
condition
of
heirs
of
death
to
the
inheritance
of
heaven
if
all
this
implies
no
moral
change
then
these
words
have
lost
their
meaning
of
the
baptists
err
in
asserting
that
baptism
by
immersion
is
the
only
valid
mode
baptism
may
be
validly
administered
in
either
of
three
ways
viz
by
or
by
plunging
the
candidate
into
the
water
by
or
by
pouring
the
water
and
by
or
sprinkling
as
our
lord
nowhere
prescribes
any
special
form
of
administering
the
sacrament
the
church
exercises
her
discretion
in
adopting
the
most
convenient
mode
according
to
the
circumstances
of
time
and
place
for
several
centuries
after
the
establishment
of
christianity
baptism
was
conferred
by
immersion
but
since
the
twelfth
century
the
practice
of
baptising
by
infusion
has
prevailed
in
the
catholic
church
as
this
manner
is
attended
with
less
inconvenience
than
baptism
by
immersion
to
prove
that
baptism
by
infusion
or
by
sprinkling
is
as
legitimate
as
by
immersion
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
though
immersion
was
the
more
common
practice
in
the
primitive
church
the
sacrament
was
frequently
administered
even
then
by
infusion
and
aspersion
after
peter
s
first
discourse
three
thousand
persons
were
baptized
it
is
not
likely
that
so
many
could
have
been
immersed
in
one
day
especially
when
we
consider
the
time
occupied
in
instructing
the
candidates
on
reading
the
account
of
the
baptism
of
paul
and
the
jailer
the
context
leaves
a
strong
impression
on
the
mind
that
both
received
the
sacrament
by
aspersion
or
by
infusion
early
ecclesiastical
history
records
a
great
many
instances
in
which
baptism
was
administered
to
in
their
beds
to
in
their
cells
and
to
persons
on
the
fathers
of
the
church
never
called
in
question
the
validity
or
the
legitimacy
of
such
baptisms
now
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
candidates
in
such
situations
could
receive
the
rite
by
immersion
we
have
seen
moreover
that
baptism
has
always
been
declared
necessary
for
salvation
it
is
reasonable
hence
to
believe
that
our
lord
would
have
afforded
the
greatest
facility
for
the
reception
of
so
essential
a
sacrament
but
if
baptism
by
immersion
only
is
valid
how
many
sick
and
delicate
persons
how
many
prisoners
and
seafaring
people
how
many
thousands
living
in
the
frigid
zone
or
even
in
the
temperate
zone
in
the
depth
of
an
inclement
winter
though
craving
the
grace
of
regeneration
would
be
deprived
of
god
s
seal
or
would
receive
it
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
surely
god
does
not
ordinarily
impose
his
ordinances
upon
us
under
such
a
penalty
moreover
if
immersion
is
the
only
valid
form
of
baptism
what
has
become
of
the
millions
of
souls
who
in
every
age
and
country
have
been
regenerated
by
the
infusion
or
the
aspersion
of
water
in
the
christian
church
chapter
xx
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
confirmation
is
a
sacrament
in
which
through
the
imposition
of
the
bishop
s
hands
unction
and
prayer
baptized
persons
receive
the
holy
ghost
that
they
may
steadfastly
profess
their
faith
and
lead
upright
lives
this
sacrament
is
called
because
it
or
strengthens
the
soul
by
divine
grace
sometimes
it
is
named
laying
on
of
because
the
bishop
imposes
his
hands
on
those
whom
he
confirms
it
is
also
known
by
the
name
of
because
the
forehead
of
the
person
confirmed
is
anointed
with
chrism
in
the
form
of
a
cross
frequent
mention
is
made
of
this
sacrament
in
the
holy
scripture
in
the
acts
it
is
written
that
when
the
apostles
who
were
in
jerusalem
had
heard
that
samaria
had
received
the
word
of
god
they
sent
unto
them
peter
and
john
who
when
they
were
come
prayed
for
them
that
they
might
receive
the
holy
ghost
for
he
was
not
yet
come
upon
any
of
them
but
they
were
only
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
then
they
laid
their
hands
on
them
and
they
received
the
holy
it
is
also
related
that
the
disciples
at
ephesus
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
and
when
paul
had
imposed
his
hands
upon
them
the
holy
ghost
came
upon
them
and
they
spoke
tongues
and
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
paul
enumerates
confirmation
or
the
laying
on
of
hands
together
with
baptism
and
penance
among
the
fundamental
truths
of
christianity
to
the
corinthians
he
writes
he
that
confirmeth
us
with
you
in
christ
and
that
hath
anointed
us
is
god
who
also
hath
sealed
us
and
given
the
pledge
of
the
spirit
in
our
god
us
in
faith
he
hath
us
by
spiritual
unction
typified
by
the
sacred
chrism
which
is
marked
on
our
foreheads
he
hath
us
by
the
indelible
character
stamped
on
our
souls
which
is
indicated
by
the
sign
of
the
cross
impressed
on
us
he
hath
given
the
of
the
holy
ghost
in
our
hearts
by
the
testimony
of
a
good
conscience
as
an
earnest
of
future
glory
the
bishop
performs
the
external
unction
but
god
who
worketh
all
in
all
sanctifies
the
soul
by
his
secret
operation
it
can
not
be
asserted
that
the
laying
on
of
hands
and
the
graces
which
followed
from
it
as
recorded
in
the
acts
were
not
intended
to
be
continued
after
the
apostles
times
for
there
is
no
warrant
for
such
an
assumption
this
function
of
imposing
hands
formed
as
regular
and
imperative
a
part
of
the
apostolic
ministry
as
the
duties
which
they
exercised
in
preaching
baptizing
ordaining
etc
hence
the
successors
of
the
apostles
in
the
nineteenth
century
have
precisely
the
same
authority
and
obligation
to
confirm
as
they
have
to
preach
to
baptize
or
to
ordain
those
who
were
confirmed
by
the
apostles
usually
gave
evidence
of
the
grace
which
they
received
by
prophecy
the
gift
of
tongues
and
the
manifestation
of
other
miraculous
powers
it
may
be
asked
why
do
not
these
gifts
accompany
now
the
imposition
of
hands
i
answer
because
they
are
no
longer
needed
the
grace
which
the
apostolic
disciples
received
was
for
their
personal
sanctification
the
gift
of
tongues
which
they
exercised
was
intended
by
almighty
god
to
edify
and
enlighten
the
spectators
and
to
give
divine
sanction
to
the
apostolic
ministry
but
now
that
the
church
is
firmly
established
and
the
divine
authority
of
her
ministry
is
clearly
recognized
these
miracles
are
no
longer
necessary
gregory
illustrates
this
point
by
a
happy
comparison
as
the
sapling
he
says
when
it
is
first
planted
is
regularly
watered
by
the
gardener
who
softens
the
earth
around
it
that
the
sun
and
the
moisture
may
nourish
its
roots
until
it
takes
deep
root
and
it
no
longer
requires
any
special
care
so
the
church
in
her
infancy
had
to
be
nourished
by
the
miraculous
power
of
god
but
after
it
had
taken
root
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
spread
its
branches
over
the
earth
it
was
left
to
the
ordinary
agencies
of
providence
augustine
writes
also
on
the
same
subject
in
the
first
days
of
the
church
the
holy
ghost
came
down
on
believers
and
they
spoke
in
tongues
which
they
had
not
learned
these
were
miracles
suited
to
the
times
is
it
now
expected
that
they
upon
whom
hands
are
laid
should
speak
with
tongues
or
when
we
imposed
hands
on
these
children
did
each
of
you
wait
to
see
whether
they
would
speak
with
tongues
if
then
there
be
not
now
a
testimony
to
the
presence
of
the
holy
spirit
by
means
of
these
miracles
whence
is
it
proved
that
he
has
received
the
holy
spirit
let
him
ask
his
own
heart
if
he
loves
his
brother
the
spirit
of
god
abides
in
following
in
the
footsteps
of
the
apostles
we
find
the
fathers
of
the
church
from
the
earliest
age
recognizing
confirmation
as
a
divine
and
sacramental
institution
and
proclaiming
its
salutary
effects
the
flesh
says
tertullian
is
that
the
soul
may
be
consecrated
the
flesh
is
marked
that
the
soul
may
be
fortified
the
flesh
is
overshadowed
the
imposition
of
that
the
soul
may
be
enlightened
with
the
cyprian
speaking
of
the
christians
baptized
in
samaria
says
because
they
had
received
the
legitimate
baptism
what
was
wanting
that
was
done
by
peter
and
john
that
prayer
being
made
for
them
and
hands
imposed
the
holy
ghost
should
be
invoked
and
poured
forth
upon
them
now
also
is
done
amongst
so
that
they
who
are
baptized
in
the
church
are
presented
to
the
bishops
of
the
church
and
by
our
prayer
and
imposition
of
hands
they
receive
the
holy
ghost
and
are
perfected
with
the
seal
of
the
cyril
of
jerusalem
compares
the
sacred
chrism
in
confirmation
to
the
eucharist
you
were
anointed
with
oil
being
made
sharers
and
partners
of
christ
and
see
well
that
you
regard
it
not
as
mere
ointment
for
as
the
bread
of
the
eucharist
after
the
invocation
of
the
holy
ghost
is
no
longer
mere
bread
but
the
body
of
christ
so
likewise
this
holy
ointment
is
no
longer
common
ointment
after
the
invocation
but
the
gift
of
christ
and
of
the
holy
ghost
being
rendered
efficient
by
his
divinity
you
were
anointed
on
the
forehead
that
you
might
be
delivered
from
the
shame
which
the
first
transgressor
always
experienced
and
that
you
might
contemplate
the
glory
of
god
with
an
unveiled
countenance
as
christ
after
his
baptism
and
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
upon
him
going
forth
overcame
the
adversary
so
you
likewise
after
holy
baptism
and
the
mysterious
unction
clothed
with
the
panoply
of
the
holy
ghost
stand
against
the
adverse
power
and
subdue
it
saying
i
can
do
all
things
in
christ
who
strengtheneth
ambrose
commenting
on
these
words
of
the
apostle
god
hath
given
us
the
pledge
of
the
spirit
ii
cor
i
expressly
applies
the
text
to
the
seal
of
confirmation
remember
he
says
that
you
have
received
the
spiritual
seal
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
fortitude
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
piety
the
spirit
of
holy
fear
god
the
father
hath
sealed
you
christ
the
lord
hath
you
and
hath
given
the
pledge
of
the
spirit
in
your
hearts
you
have
learned
from
the
lesson
read
from
the
ambrose
here
speaks
of
the
sevenfold
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
which
are
received
in
confirmation
and
every
bishop
in
our
day
invokes
these
same
gifts
on
those
whom
he
is
about
to
confirm
do
you
know
writes
jerome
against
the
sect
of
luciferians
of
his
time
that
it
is
the
practice
of
the
churches
that
the
imposition
of
hands
should
be
performed
over
baptized
persons
and
the
holy
ghost
thus
invoked
do
you
ask
where
it
is
written
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
but
were
there
no
scriptural
authority
at
hand
the
consent
of
the
whole
world
in
this
regard
would
have
the
force
of
you
willingly
understand
says
augustine
by
this
ointment
the
sacrament
of
chrism
which
indeed
in
the
class
of
visible
seals
is
as
sacred
as
baptism
the
oriental
schismatic
churches
recognize
confirmation
as
a
sacrament
and
administer
the
rite
as
we
do
by
the
imposition
of
hands
and
the
application
of
chrism
now
some
of
these
churches
have
been
separated
from
the
catholic
church
since
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
this
fact
is
an
eloquent
vindication
of
the
apostolic
antiquity
of
confirmation
and
is
an
ample
refutation
of
those
who
would
ascribe
to
it
a
more
recent
origin
protestantism
which
made
such
havoc
of
the
other
sacraments
did
not
fail
to
abolish
confirmation
in
its
sweeping
revolution
the
episcopal
church
retains
indeed
the
name
of
confirmation
in
its
ritual
and
even
borrows
a
portion
of
our
prayers
and
ceremonial
but
in
opposition
to
the
uniform
teaching
of
the
catholic
as
well
as
of
all
the
oriental
churches
both
orthodox
and
schismatic
it
declares
confirmation
to
be
a
mere
rite
and
not
a
sacrament
in
violation
of
the
practice
of
all
antiquity
it
mutilates
the
rite
by
omitting
the
sacred
unction
it
retains
the
shadow
without
the
substance
it
raises
indeed
its
hands
over
the
candidates
but
they
are
not
the
anointed
hands
of
peter
or
john
or
cyprian
or
augustine
to
whom
it
is
said
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bless
let
it
be
blessed
whatsoever
thou
shalt
sanctify
let
it
be
their
hands
were
lifted
up
with
authority
and
clothed
with
supernatural
power
but
the
hands
of
the
episcopal
bishops
are
spiritually
paralyzed
by
the
suicidal
act
of
the
reformers
and
they
expressly
disclaim
any
sacramental
efficacy
in
the
rite
which
they
administer
chapter
xxi
the
holy
eucharist
among
the
various
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
there
is
none
which
rests
on
stronger
scriptural
authority
than
the
doctrine
of
the
real
presence
of
jesus
christ
in
the
holy
eucharist
so
copious
indeed
and
so
clear
are
the
passages
of
the
new
testament
which
treat
of
this
subject
that
i
am
at
a
loss
to
determine
which
to
select
and
find
it
difficult
to
compress
them
all
within
the
compass
of
this
short
chapter
the
evangelists
do
not
always
dwell
upon
the
same
mysteries
of
religion
their
practice
is
rather
to
supplement
each
other
so
that
one
of
them
will
mention
what
the
others
have
omitted
or
have
touched
in
a
cursory
way
but
in
regard
to
the
blessed
eucharist
the
sacred
writers
exhibit
a
marked
deviation
from
this
rule
we
find
that
the
four
evangelists
together
with
paul
have
written
so
explicitly
and
abundantly
on
this
subject
that
one
of
them
alone
would
be
amply
sufficient
to
prove
the
dogma
without
taking
them
collectively
these
five
inspired
writers
gave
the
weight
of
their
individual
testimony
to
the
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
because
they
rather
the
holy
ghost
speaking
through
them
this
great
mystery
which
exacts
so
strong
an
exercise
of
our
faith
and
which
bids
us
bow
down
our
understanding
unto
the
obedience
of
christ
would
meet
with
opposition
in
the
course
of
time
from
those
who
would
measure
the
infallible
word
of
god
by
the
erring
standard
of
their
own
judgment
i
shall
select
three
classes
of
arguments
from
the
new
testament
which
satisfactorily
demonstrate
the
real
presence
of
christ
in
the
blessed
sacrament
the
first
of
these
texts
speaks
of
the
promise
of
the
eucharist
the
second
of
its
institution
and
the
third
of
its
use
among
the
faithful
to
begin
with
the
words
of
the
promise
while
jesus
was
once
preaching
near
the
coast
of
the
sea
of
galilee
he
was
followed
as
usual
by
an
immense
multitude
of
persons
who
were
attracted
to
him
by
the
miracles
which
he
wrought
and
the
words
of
salvation
which
he
spoke
seeing
that
the
people
had
no
food
he
multiplied
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
to
such
an
extent
as
to
supply
the
wants
of
five
thousand
men
besides
women
and
children
our
lord
considered
the
present
a
favorable
occasion
for
speaking
of
the
sacrament
of
his
body
and
blood
which
was
to
be
distributed
not
to
a
few
thousands
but
to
millions
of
souls
not
in
one
place
but
everywhere
not
at
one
time
but
for
all
days
to
the
end
of
the
world
i
am
he
says
to
his
hearers
the
bread
of
life
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
in
the
desert
and
died
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
forever
and
the
bread
which
i
will
give
is
my
flesh
for
the
life
of
the
world
the
jews
therefore
disputed
among
themselves
saying
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
then
jesus
said
to
them
amen
amen
i
say
to
you
unless
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
ye
shall
not
have
life
in
you
he
that
eateth
my
flesh
and
drinketh
my
blood
hath
everlasting
life
and
i
will
raise
him
up
on
the
last
day
for
my
flesh
is
meat
indeed
and
my
blood
drink
if
these
words
had
fallen
on
your
ears
for
the
first
time
and
if
you
had
been
among
the
number
of
our
savior
s
hearers
on
that
occasion
would
you
not
have
been
irresistibly
led
by
the
noble
simplicity
of
his
words
to
understand
him
as
speaking
truly
of
his
body
and
blood
for
his
language
is
not
susceptible
of
any
other
interpretation
when
our
savior
says
to
the
jews
your
fathers
did
eat
manna
and
died
but
he
that
eateth
this
eucharistic
bread
shall
live
forever
he
evidently
wishes
to
affirm
the
superiority
of
the
food
which
he
would
give
over
the
manna
by
which
the
children
of
israel
were
nourished
now
if
the
eucharist
were
merely
commemorative
bread
and
wine
instead
of
being
superior
it
would
be
really
inferior
to
the
manna
for
the
manna
was
supernatural
heavenly
miraculous
food
while
bread
and
wine
are
a
natural
earthly
food
but
the
best
and
the
most
reliable
interpreters
of
our
savior
s
words
are
certainly
the
multitude
and
the
disciples
who
are
listening
to
him
they
all
understood
the
import
of
his
language
precisely
as
it
is
explained
by
the
catholic
church
they
believed
that
our
lord
spoke
literally
of
his
body
and
blood
the
evangelist
tells
us
that
the
jews
disputed
among
themselves
saying
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
even
his
disciples
though
avoiding
the
disrespectful
language
of
the
multitude
gave
expression
to
their
doubt
in
this
milder
form
this
saying
is
hard
and
who
can
hear
it
so
much
were
they
shocked
at
our
savior
s
promise
that
after
this
many
of
his
disciples
went
back
and
walked
no
more
with
they
evidently
implied
by
their
words
and
conduct
that
they
understood
jesus
to
have
spoken
literally
of
his
flesh
for
had
they
interpreted
his
words
in
a
figurative
sense
it
would
not
have
been
a
hard
saying
nor
have
led
them
to
abandon
their
master
but
perhaps
i
shall
be
told
that
the
disciples
and
the
jews
who
heard
our
savior
may
have
misinterpreted
his
meaning
by
taking
his
words
in
the
literal
acceptation
while
he
may
have
spoken
in
a
figurative
sense
this
objection
is
easily
disposed
of
it
sometimes
happened
indeed
that
our
savior
was
misunderstood
by
his
hearers
on
such
occasions
he
always
took
care
to
remove
from
their
mind
the
wrong
impression
they
had
formed
by
stating
his
meaning
in
simpler
language
thus
for
instance
having
told
nicodemus
that
unless
a
man
be
born
again
he
can
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
having
observed
that
his
meaning
was
not
correctly
apprehended
by
this
disciple
our
savior
added
unless
a
man
be
born
again
of
water
and
the
holy
ghost
he
can
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
and
again
when
he
warned
his
disciples
against
the
leaven
of
the
pharisees
and
finding
that
they
had
taken
an
erroneous
meaning
from
his
word
he
immediately
subjoined
that
they
should
beware
of
the
doctrine
of
the
pharisees
but
in
the
present
instance
does
our
savior
alter
his
language
when
he
finds
his
words
taken
in
the
literal
sense
does
he
tell
his
hearers
that
he
has
spoken
figuratively
does
he
soften
the
tone
of
his
expression
far
from
weakening
the
force
of
his
words
he
repeats
what
he
said
before
and
in
language
more
emphatic
amen
amen
i
say
unto
you
unless
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
ye
shall
not
have
life
in
when
our
savior
beheld
the
jews
and
many
of
his
disciples
abandoning
him
turning
to
the
chosen
twelve
he
said
feelingly
to
them
will
ye
also
go
away
and
simon
peter
answered
him
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
you
my
dear
reader
must
also
take
your
choice
will
you
reply
with
the
jews
or
with
the
disciples
of
little
faith
or
with
peter
ah
let
some
say
with
the
unbelieving
jews
how
can
this
man
give
us
his
flesh
to
eat
let
others
say
with
the
unfaithful
disciples
this
is
a
hard
saying
who
can
hear
it
but
do
you
say
with
peter
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
thou
hast
the
words
of
eternal
so
far
i
have
dwelt
on
the
words
of
the
promise
i
shall
now
proceed
to
the
words
of
the
institution
which
are
given
in
almost
the
same
expressions
by
matthew
mark
and
luke
in
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
we
read
the
following
narrative
and
while
they
were
at
supper
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
and
broke
and
gave
to
his
disciples
and
said
take
ye
and
eat
this
is
my
body
and
taking
the
chalice
he
gave
thanks
and
gave
to
them
saying
drink
ye
all
of
this
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
shall
be
shed
for
many
unto
remission
of
i
beg
you
to
recall
to
mind
the
former
text
relative
to
the
promise
and
to
compare
it
with
this
how
admirably
they
fit
together
like
two
links
in
a
chain
how
faithfully
has
jesus
fulfilled
the
promise
which
he
made
could
any
idea
be
expressed
in
clearer
terms
than
these
this
is
my
body
this
is
my
blood
why
is
the
catholic
interpretation
of
these
words
rejected
by
protestants
is
it
because
the
text
is
in
itself
obscure
and
ambiguous
by
no
means
but
simply
because
they
do
not
comprehend
how
god
could
perform
so
stupendous
a
miracle
as
to
give
his
body
and
blood
for
our
spiritual
nourishment
is
then
the
power
or
the
mercy
of
god
to
be
measured
by
the
narrow
rule
of
the
human
understanding
is
the
almighty
not
permitted
to
do
anything
except
what
we
can
sanction
by
our
reason
is
a
thing
to
be
declared
impossible
because
we
can
not
see
its
possibility
has
not
god
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
of
by
the
fiat
of
his
word
what
a
mystery
is
this
does
he
not
hold
this
world
in
the
midst
of
space
does
he
not
transform
the
tiny
blade
into
nutritious
grain
did
he
not
feed
upwards
of
five
thousand
persons
with
five
loaves
and
two
fishes
what
a
mystery
did
he
not
rain
down
manna
from
heaven
for
forty
years
to
feed
the
children
of
israel
in
the
desert
did
he
not
change
rivers
into
blood
in
egypt
and
water
into
wine
at
the
wedding
of
cana
does
he
not
daily
make
devout
souls
the
tabernacles
of
the
holy
ghost
and
shall
we
have
the
hardihood
to
deny
in
spite
of
our
lord
s
plain
declaration
that
god
who
works
these
wonders
is
able
to
change
bread
and
wine
into
his
body
and
blood
for
the
food
of
our
souls
you
tell
me
it
is
a
mystery
above
your
comprehension
a
mystery
indeed
a
religion
that
rejects
a
revealed
truth
because
it
is
incomprehensible
contains
in
itself
the
seeds
of
dissolution
and
will
end
in
rationalism
is
not
everything
around
us
a
mystery
are
we
not
a
mystery
to
ourselves
explain
to
me
how
the
blood
circulates
in
your
veins
how
the
soul
animates
and
permeates
the
whole
body
how
the
hand
moves
at
the
will
of
the
soul
explain
to
me
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
is
not
the
scripture
full
of
incomprehensible
mysteries
do
you
not
believe
in
the
mystery
not
only
above
but
apparently
contrary
to
reason
do
you
not
admit
the
the
helpless
infant
in
bethlehem
was
god
i
understand
why
rationalists
who
admit
nothing
above
their
reason
reject
the
real
presence
but
that
bible
christians
should
reject
it
is
to
me
incomprehensible
but
do
those
who
reject
the
catholic
interpretation
explain
this
text
to
their
own
satisfaction
this
is
my
body
etc
alas
here
their
burden
begins
only
a
few
years
after
the
early
reformers
had
rejected
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
no
fewer
than
one
hundred
meanings
were
given
to
these
words
this
is
my
it
is
far
easier
to
destroy
than
to
rebuild
let
me
now
offer
you
some
additional
reasons
in
favor
of
the
catholic
or
literal
sense
according
to
a
common
rule
observed
in
the
interpretation
of
the
holy
scripture
we
must
always
take
the
words
in
their
literal
signification
unless
we
have
some
special
reason
which
obliges
us
to
accept
them
in
a
figurative
meaning
now
in
the
present
instance
far
from
being
forced
to
employ
the
words
above
quoted
in
a
figurative
sense
every
circumstance
connected
with
the
delivery
of
them
obliges
us
to
interpret
them
in
their
plain
and
literal
acceptation
to
whom
did
our
savior
address
these
words
at
what
time
and
under
what
circumstances
did
he
speak
he
was
addressing
his
few
chosen
disciples
to
whom
he
promised
to
speak
in
future
not
in
parables
nor
in
obscure
language
but
in
the
words
of
simple
truth
he
uttered
these
words
the
night
before
his
passion
and
when
will
a
person
use
plainer
speech
than
at
the
point
of
death
these
words
this
is
my
body
this
is
my
blood
embodied
a
new
dogma
of
faith
which
all
were
obliged
to
believe
and
a
new
law
which
all
were
obliged
to
practice
they
were
the
last
will
and
testament
of
our
blessed
savior
what
language
should
be
plainer
than
that
which
contains
an
article
of
faith
what
words
should
be
more
free
from
tropes
and
figures
than
those
which
enforce
a
divine
law
but
above
all
where
will
you
find
any
words
more
plain
and
unvarnished
than
those
contained
in
a
last
will
now
if
we
understand
these
words
in
their
plain
and
obvious
that
is
in
their
catholic
sense
no
language
can
be
more
simple
and
intelligible
but
if
we
depart
from
the
catholic
interpretation
then
it
is
impossible
to
attach
to
them
any
reasonable
meaning
we
now
arrive
at
the
third
class
of
scripture
texts
which
have
reference
to
the
use
or
reception
of
the
sacrament
among
the
faithful
when
jesus
as
you
remember
instituted
the
eucharist
at
his
last
supper
he
commanded
his
disciples
and
their
successors
to
renew
till
the
end
of
time
in
remembrance
of
him
the
ceremony
which
he
performed
what
i
have
done
do
ye
also
for
a
commemoration
of
we
have
a
very
satisfactory
means
of
ascertaining
the
apostolic
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
by
examining
what
the
apostles
did
in
commemoration
of
our
lord
did
they
bless
and
distribute
mere
bread
and
wine
to
the
faithful
or
did
they
consecrate
as
they
believed
the
body
and
blood
of
jesus
christ
if
they
professed
to
give
only
bread
and
wine
in
memory
of
our
lord
s
supper
then
the
catholic
interpretation
falls
to
the
ground
if
on
the
contrary
we
find
the
apostles
and
their
successors
from
the
first
to
the
nineteenth
century
professing
to
consecrate
and
dispense
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
doing
so
by
virtue
of
the
command
of
their
savior
then
the
catholic
interpretation
alone
is
admissible
let
paul
be
our
first
witness
represent
yourself
as
a
member
of
the
primitive
christian
congregation
assembled
in
corinth
about
eighteen
years
after
matthew
wrote
his
gospel
a
letter
is
read
from
the
apostle
paul
in
which
the
following
words
occur
the
chalice
of
benediction
which
we
bless
is
it
not
the
communion
of
the
blood
of
christ
and
the
bread
which
we
break
is
it
not
the
partaking
of
the
body
of
the
lord
for
i
have
received
of
the
lord
that
which
also
i
delivered
to
you
that
the
lord
jesus
on
the
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
bread
and
giving
thanks
brake
it
and
said
take
and
eat
this
is
my
body
which
shall
be
delivered
for
you
this
do
for
the
commemoration
of
me
in
like
manner
also
the
chalice
after
the
supper
saying
this
cup
is
the
new
covenant
in
my
blood
this
do
ye
as
often
as
ye
shall
drink
for
the
commemoration
of
me
for
as
often
as
ye
shall
eat
this
bread
and
drink
the
cup
ye
shall
show
the
death
of
the
lord
until
he
come
therefore
whoever
shall
eat
this
bread
or
drink
the
chalice
of
the
lord
unworthily
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
of
the
blood
of
the
but
let
a
man
prove
himself
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
bread
and
drink
of
the
chalice
for
he
who
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
judgment
to
himself
discerning
the
body
of
the
could
paul
express
more
clearly
his
belief
in
the
real
presence
than
he
has
done
here
the
apostle
distinctly
affirms
that
the
chalice
and
bread
which
he
and
his
fellow
apostles
bless
is
a
participation
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
surely
no
one
could
be
said
to
partake
of
that
divine
food
by
eating
ordinary
bread
mark
these
words
of
the
apostle
whosoever
shall
take
the
sacrament
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
what
a
heinous
crime
for
these
words
signify
that
he
who
receives
the
sacrament
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
sin
of
high
treason
and
of
shedding
the
blood
of
his
lord
in
vain
but
how
could
he
be
guilty
of
a
crime
so
enormous
if
he
had
taken
in
the
eucharist
only
a
particle
of
bread
and
wine
would
a
man
be
accused
of
homicide
in
this
commonwealth
if
he
were
to
offer
violence
to
the
statue
or
painting
of
the
governor
certainly
not
in
like
manner
paul
would
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
declare
a
man
guilty
of
trampling
on
the
blood
of
his
savior
by
drinking
in
an
unworthy
manner
a
little
wine
in
memory
of
him
study
also
these
words
he
who
eateth
and
drinketh
unworthily
eateth
and
drinketh
condemnation
to
himself
discerning
the
body
of
the
the
unworthy
receiver
is
condemned
for
not
recognizing
or
discerning
in
the
eucharist
the
body
of
the
lord
how
could
he
be
blamed
for
not
discerning
the
body
of
the
lord
if
there
were
only
bread
and
wine
before
him
hence
if
the
words
of
paul
are
figuratively
understood
they
are
distorted
forced
and
exaggerated
terms
without
meaning
or
truth
but
if
they
are
taken
literally
they
are
full
of
sense
and
of
awful
significance
and
an
eloquent
commentary
on
the
words
i
have
quoted
from
the
evangelist
the
fathers
of
the
church
without
an
exception
the
language
of
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
by
proclaiming
the
real
presence
of
our
lord
in
the
eucharist
i
have
counted
the
names
of
fathers
and
eminent
ecclesiastical
writers
flourishing
between
the
first
and
sixth
century
all
of
whom
proclaim
the
real
by
explaining
the
mystery
others
by
thanking
god
for
his
inestimable
gift
and
others
by
exhorting
the
faithful
to
its
worthy
reception
from
such
a
host
of
witnesses
i
can
select
here
only
a
few
at
random
ignatius
a
disciple
of
peter
speaking
of
a
sect
called
gnostics
says
they
abstain
from
the
eucharist
and
prayer
because
they
confess
not
that
the
eucharist
and
prayer
is
the
flesh
of
our
savior
jesus
justin
martyr
in
an
apology
to
the
emperor
antoninus
writes
in
the
second
century
we
do
not
receive
these
things
as
common
bread
and
drink
but
as
jesus
christ
our
savior
was
made
flesh
by
the
word
of
god
even
so
we
have
been
taught
that
the
eucharist
is
the
flesh
and
the
blood
of
the
same
incarnate
origen

writes
if
thou
wilt
go
up
with
christ
to
celebrate
the
passover
he
will
give
to
thee
that
bread
of
benediction
his
own
body
and
will
vouchsafe
to

henceforward
and
he
having
said
is
my
who
shall
ever
doubt
saying
this
is
not
his
blood
he
once
at
cana
turned
water
into
wine
which
is
akin
to
blood
and
is
he
undeserving
of
belief
when
he
turned
wine
into
blood
he
seems
to
be
arguing
with
modern
unbelief
john
chrysostom
who
died
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
preaching
on
the
eucharist
says
if
thou
wert
indeed
incorporeal
he
would
have
delivered
to
thee
those
same
incorporeal
gifts
without
covering
but
since
the
soul
is
united
to
the
body
he
delivers
to
thee
in
things
perceptible
to
the
senses
the
things
to
be
apprehended
by
the
understanding
how
many
nowadays
say
would
that
they
could

the
says
i
promised
you
a

wherein

would

the
sacrament
of
the
lord
s
table
which
sacrament
you
even
now
behold
and
of
which
you
were
last

partakers
you

to
know
what
you

the

which
you
see
on

by
the

is
the
body
of

that
chalice
after
being
sanctified
by
the
word
of
god
is
the
blood
of
but
why
multiply
authorities
at
the
present
day
every
christian
communion
throughout
the
world
with
the
sole
exception
of
protestants
proclaim
its
belief
in
the
real
presence
of
christ
in
the
sacrament
the
nestorians
and
eutychians
who
separated
from
the
catholic
church
in
the
fifth
century
admit
the
corporeal
presence
of
our
lord
in
the
eucharist
such
also
is
the
faith
of
the
greek
church
which
seceded
from
us
a
thousand
years
ago
of
the
present
russian
church
of
the
schismatic
copts
the

short
of

the
oriental
sects
no

chapter
xxii
communion
under
one
kind
our
savior
gave
communion
under
both
forms
of
bread
and
wine
to
his
apostles
at
the
last
supper
officiating
bishops
and
priests
are
always
required
except
on
good
friday
to
communicate
under
both
kinds
but
even
the
clergy
of
every
rank
including
the
pope
receive
only
of
the
consecrated
bread
unless
when
they
celebrate
mass
the
church
teaches
that
christ
is
contained
whole
and
entire
under
each
species
so
that
whoever
communicates
under
the
form
of
bread
of
wine
receives
not
a
mutilated
sacrament
or
a
divided
savior
but
shares
in
the
whole
sacrament
as
fully
as
if
he
participated
in
both
forms
hence
the
layman
who
receives
the
consecrated
bread
partakes
as
copiously
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
as
the
officiating
priest
who
receives
both
consecrated
elements
our
lord
says
i
am
the
living
bread
which
came
down
from
heaven
if
any
man
eat
of
this
bread
he
shall
live
forever
and
the
bread
which
i
will
give
is
my
flesh
for
the
life
of
the
world
he
that
eateth
me
the
same
also
shall
live
by
me
he
that
eateth
this
bread
shall
live
from
this
passage
it
is
evident
that
whoever
partakes
of
the
form
of
bread
partakes
of
the
living
flesh
of
jesus
christ
which
is
inseparable
from
his
blood
and
which
being
now
in
a
glorious
state
can
not
be
divided
for
christ
rising
from
the
dead
dieth
now
no
our
lord
in
his
words
quoted
makes
no
reference
to
the
sacramental
cup
but
only
to
the
eucharistic
bread
to
which
he
ascribes
all
the
efficacy
which
is
attached
to
communion
under
both
kinds
union
with
him
spiritual
life
eternal
salvation
paul
writing
to
the
corinthians
says
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread
drink
the
chalice
of
the
lord
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
of
the
blood
of
the
the
apostle
here
plainly
declares
that
by
an
unworthy
participation
in
the
lord
s
supper
under
the
form
of
either
bread
or
wine
we
profane
both
the
body
and
the
blood
of
christ
how
could
this
be
so
unless
christ
is
entirely
contained
under
each
species
so
forcibly
indeed
did
the
apostle
assert
the
catholic
doctrine
that
the
protestant
translators
have
perverted
the
text
by
rendering
it
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread
drink
the
chalice
substituting
for
in
contradiction
to
the
greek
original
of
which
the
catholic
version
is
an
exact
translation
it
is
also
the
received
doctrine
of
the
fathers
that
the
eucharist
is
contained
in
all
its
integrity
either
in
the
consecrated
bread
or
in
the
chalice
augustine
who
may
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
the
rest
says
that
each
one
receives
christ
the
lord
under
each
luther
himself
even
after
his
revolt
was
so
clearly
convinced
of
this
truth
that
he
was
an
uncompromising
advocate
of
communion
under
one
kind
if
any
council
he
says
should
decree
or
permit
both
species
we
would
by
no
means
acquiesce
but
in
spite
of
the
council
and
its
statute
we
would
use
one
form
or
neither
and
never
leibnitz
the
eminent
protestant
divine
observes
can
not
be
that
christ
is
received
entire
by
of
concomitance
under
each
species
nor
is
his
flesh
separated
from
his
as
the
same
virtue
is
contained
in
the
sacrament
whether
administered
in
one
or
both
forms
the
faithful
gain
nothing
by
receiving
under
both
kinds
and
lose
nothing
by
receiving
under
one
form
consequently
we
nowhere
find
our
savior
requiring
the
communion
to
be
administered
to
the
faithful
under
both
forms
but
he
has
left
this
matter
to
be
regulated
by
the
wisdom
and
discretion
of
the
church
as
he
has
done
with
regard
to
the
manner
of
administering
baptism
our
redeemer
it
is
true
has
said
drink
ye
all
of
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
these
words
were
addressed
not
to
the
people
at
large
but
only
to
the
apostles
who
alone
were
also
commanded
on
the
same
occasion
to
consecrate
his
body
and
blood
in
remembrance
of
him
now
we
have
no
more
right
to
infer
that
the
faithful
are
obliged
to
drink
of
the
cup
because
the
apostles
were
commanded
to
drink
of
it
than
we
have
to
suppose
that
the
laity
are
required
or
allowed
to
consecrate
the
bread
and
wine
because
the
power
of
doing
so
was
at
the
last
supper
conferred
on
the
apostles
it
is
true
also
that
our
lord
said
to
the
people
unless
ye
eat
the
flesh
of
the
son
of
man
and
drink
his
blood
ye
shall
not
have
life
in
but
this
command
is
literally
fulfilled
by
the
laity
when
they
partake
of
the
consecrated
bread
which
as
we
have
seen
contains
christ
the
lord
in
all
his
integrity
hence
if
our
savior
has
said
whoso
eateth
my
flesh
and
drinketh
my
blood
hath
everlasting
life
he
has
also
said
the
bread
which
i
will
give
is
my
flesh
for
the
life
of
the
it
seems
to
me
that
the
charge
of
withholding
the
cup
comes
with
very
bad
grace
from
protestant
teachers
who
destroy
the
whole
intrinsic
virtue
of
the
sacrament
by
giving
to
their
followers
nothing
but
bread
and
wine
the
difference
between
them
and
us
lies
in
under
one
form
we
give
the
while
they
under
two
forms
confessedly
give
only
the
in
examining
the
history
of
the
church
on
the
subject
we
find
that
up
to
the
twelfth
century
communion
was
sometimes
distributed
in
one
form
sometimes
in
another
commonly
in
both
luke
tells
us
that
the
converts
of
jerusalem
were
persevering
in
the
doctrine
of
the
apostles
and
in
the
communion
of
bread
as
the
eucharist
was
sometimes
familiarly
called
and
in
again
he
speaks
of
the
christian
disciples
assembled
at
troas
on
the
lord
s
day
to
break
we
are
led
to
conclude
from
these
passages
that
the
apostles
sometimes
distributed
the
communion
in
the
form
of
bread
alone
as
no
reference
is
made
to
the
cup
it
was
certainly
the
custom
to
carry
to
the
sick
only
the
consecrated
host
surely
if
there
is
any
period
of
life
when
nothing
should
be
neglected
which
conduces
to
salvation
it
is
the
time
of
approaching
death
eusebius
tells
us
that
the
aged
serapion
received
only
the
sacred
bread
at
the
hands
of
the
priest
in
the
of
ambrose
we
are
told
that
in
his
last
illness
the
consecrated
host
alone
was
given
to
him
the
christians
in
time
of
persecution
confessors
of
the
faith
confined
in
prison
travellers
on
their
journey
soldiers
before
engaging
in
battle
and
hermits
living
in
the
desert
were
permitted
to
keep
with
them
and
to
fortify
themselves
with
the
consecrated
tertullian
cyprian
basil
ambrose
and
other
fathers
of
the
church
testify
moreover
the
mass
of
the
celebrated
in
the
latin
church
on
good
friday
only
and
in
the
greek
church
on
every
day
in
lent
except
saturdays
and
sundays
the
officiating
priest
receives
the
consecrated
bread
alone
in
all
these
instances
the
communicants
never
doubted
that
they
received
the
lord
s
supper
in
its
integrity
surely
the
conscientious
guides
of
the
faith
would
sooner
withhold
altogether
the
sacred
host
from
their
flocks
than
permit
them
to
partake
of
a
mutilated
sacrament
the
primitive
days
of
the
church
the
holy
communion
used
to
be
imparted
to
infants
but
only
in
the
form
of
wine
the
priest
dipped
his
finger
in
the
consecrated
chalice
and
gave
it
to
be
sucked
by
the
infant
this
custom
prevails
to
this
day
among
the
schismatic
christians
of
all
oriental
rites
in
some
instances
the
sacred
host
saturated
in
the
cup
is
given
to
the
child
communion
was
indeed
usually
administered
in
the
first
ages
under
both
forms
the
faithful
however
had
the
privilege
of
dispensing
with
the
cup
and
of
partaking
only
of
the
bread
until
the
time
of
pope
gelasius
in
the
fifth
century
when
this
general
but
hitherto
optional
practice
of
receiving
under
both
kinds
was
enforced
as
a
law
for
the
following
reason
the
manichean
sect
abstained
from
the
cup
on
the
erroneous
assumption
that
the
use
of
wine
was
sinful
pope
gelasius
in
order
to
detect
and
condemn
the
error
of
those
sectaries
left
it
no
longer
optional
with
the
faithful
to
receive
under
one
or
both
forms
but
ordained
that
all
should
communicate
under
both
kinds
this
law
continued
in
force
for
several
ages
but
towards
the
thirteenth
century
for
various
causes
it
had
gradually
grown
into
disuse
with
the
tacit
approval
of
the
church
the
council
of
constance
which
convened
in
established
a
law
requiring
the
faithful
to
communicate
under
the
form
of
bread
only
and
in
taking
this
step
the
council
was
actuated
both
by
reasons
of
propriety
and
of
religion
the
diffusion
of
christianity
throughout
the
world
had
rendered
it
very
difficult
to
supply
all
the
faithful
with
the
consecrated
wine
such
inconvenience
is
scarcely
felt
by
protestant
communicants
whose
numbers
are
limited
and
who
ordinarily
communicate
only
on
certain
sundays
of
each
month
the
catholics
of
the
world
on
the
contrary
number
about
three
hundred
millions
and
as
communion
is
administered
to
some
of
the
faithful
almost
every
day
in
most
of
our
churches
and
chapels
and
as
the
annual
communions
in
every
parish
church
are
generally
at
least
twice
as
numerous
as
its
aggregate
catholic
population
the
sum
total
of
annual
communions
throughout
the
globe
may
be
estimated
in
round
numbers
at
not
less
than
five
hundred
millions
what
effort
would
be
required
to
procure
for
such
a
multitude
in
my
missionary
journeys
through
north
carolina
i
have
often
found
it
no
easy
task
to
provide
for
the
celebration
of
mass
a
sufficiency
of
pure
wine
which
is
essential
for
the
validity
of
the
sacrifice
this
embarrassment
would
be
increased
beyond
measure
if
the
cup
had
to
be
extended
to
the
laity
and
still
more
in
the
coal
regions
where
the
cultivation
of
the
grape
is
unknown
and
where
imported
wine
is
exclusively
used
it
would
be
very
distasteful
besides
for
so
many
communicants
to
drink
successively
out
of
the
same
chalice
which
would
be
unavoidable
if
the
sacrament
were
administered
in
both
forms
in
our
larger
churches
where
communion
is
distributed
every
sunday
to
hundreds
there
would
be
great
danger
of
spilling
a
portion
of
the
consecrated
chalice
and
of
thus
exposing
it
to
profanation
but
above
all
as
the
church
in
the
fifth
century
through
her
chief
pastor
gelasius
enforced
the
use
of
the
cup
to
expose
and
reprobate
the
error
of
the
manichees
who
imagined
that
the
use
of
wine
was
sinful
so
in
the
fifteenth
century
she
withdrew
the
cup
to
condemn
the
novelties
of
the
calixtines
who
taught
that
the
consecrated
wine
was
necessary
for
a
valid
communion
should
circumstances
ever
justify
or
demand
a
change
from
the
present
discipline
the
church
will
not
hesitate
to
restore
the
cup
to
the
laity
chapter
xxiii
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
sacrifice
is
the
oblation
or
offering
made
to
god
of
some
sensible
object
with
the
destruction
or
change
of
the
object
to
denote
that
god
is
the
author
of
life
and
death
thus
in
the
old
law
before
the
coming
of
christ
when
the
hebrew
people
wished
to
offer
sacrifice
to
god
they
took
a
lamb
or
some
other
animal
which
they
slew
and
burned
its
flesh
acknowledging
by
this
act
that
the
lord
was
the
supreme
master
of
life
and
death
the
ancients
offered
to
god
two
kinds
of
sacrifices
living
creatures
such
as
bulls
lambs
and
birds
and
inanimate
objects
such
as
wheat
and
barley
and
in
general
the
first
fruits
of
the
earth
all
jews
idolaters
or
christians
except
mahometans
and
modern
made
sacrifice
their
principal
act
of
worship
if
you
go
back
to
the
very
dawn
of
creation
you
will
find
the
children
of
adam
offering
sacrifices
to
god
abel
offered
to
the
lord
the
firstlings
of
his
flock
and
cain
offered
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
when
noe
and
his
family
are
rescued
from
the
deluge
which
had
spread
over
the
face
of
the
earth
his
first
act
on
issuing
from
the
ark
when
the
waters
disappear
is
to
offer
holocausts
to
the
lord
in
thanksgiving
for
his
preservation
abraham
the
great
father
of
the
jewish
race
offered
victims
to
the
almighty
at
his
express
command
we
read
that
job
was
accustomed
to
offer
holocausts
to
the
lord
to
propitiate
his
favor
in
behalf
of
his
children
and
to
obtain
forgiveness
for
the
sins
they
might
have
committed
when
jehovah
delivered
to
moses
the
written
law
on
mount
sinai
he
gave
his
servant
the
most
minute
details
with
regard
to
all
the
ceremonies
to
be
observed
in
the
sacrifices
which
were
to
be
offered
to
him
he
prescribed
the
kind
of
victims
to
be
immolated
the
qualifications
of
the
priests
who
were
to
minister
at
the
altar
and
the
place
and
manner
in
which
the
victims
were
to
be
offered
hence
it
was
the
custom
of
the
jewish
priests
to
slay
every
day
two
lambs
as
a
sacrifice
to
god
and
in
doing
this
they
were
prefiguring
the
great
sacrifice
of
the
new
law
in
which
we
daily
offer
up
on
the
altar
the
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
in
a
word
in
all
their
public
they
were
threatened
by
their
enemies
whenever
they
were
about
to
engage
in
war
whenever
they
were
visited
by
any
plague
or
jews
had
recourse
to
god
by
solemn
sacrifices
like
the
catholic
church
of
the
present
day
they
had
sacrifices
not
only
for
the
living
but
also
for
the
dead
for
we
read
in
sacred
scripture
that
judas
machabeus
ordered
sacrifice
to
be
offered
up
for
the
souls
of
his
men
who
were
slain
in
battle
we
find
sacrifices
existing
not
only
among
the
jews
who
worshiped
the
true
god
but
also
among
pagan
and
idolatrous
nations
no
matter
how
confused
imperfect
or
erroneous
was
their
knowledge
of
the
deity
the
pagan
nations
retained
sufficient
vestiges
of
primitive
tradition
to
admonish
them
of
their
obligation
of
appeasing
the
anger
and
invoking
the
blessings
of
the
divinity
by
victims
and
sacrifices
plutarch
an
ancient
writer
of
the
second
century
says
of
these
heathen
people
you
may
find
cities
without
walls
without
literature
and
without
the
arts
and
sciences
of
civilized
life
but
you
will
never
find
a
city
without
priests
and
altars
or
which
has
not
sacrifices
offered
to
the
the
indians
of
our
own
country
were
accustomed
to
offer
sacrifice
to
the
great
spirit
as
father
jogues
and
other
pioneer
missionaries
inform
us
but
all
those
ancient
sacrifices
were
only
the
types
and
figures
of
the
great
sacrifice
of
the
new
law
from
which
they
derived
all
their
efficacy
just
as
the
old
law
itself
was
the
type
of
the
new
law
of
grace
since
the
ancient
sacrifices
were
but
figures
and
shadows
they
were
imperfect
and
insufficient
for
it
is
impossible
says
paul
that
by
the
blood
of
oxen
and
of
goats
sins
should
be
taken
away
wherefore
when
he
jesus
cometh
into
the
world
he
saith
sacrifice
and
oblation
thou
wouldst
not
but
a
body
thou
hast
fitted
to
me
holocausts
for
sin
did
not
please
thee
then
said
i
behold
i
as
if
he
should
say
the
blood
of
oxen
and
of
goats
is
not
sufficient
to
appease
thy
vengeance
and
to
cleanse
thy
people
from
their
sins
therefore
i
come
that
i
may
offer
myself
an
acceptable
sacrifice
for
the
sins
of
the
world
the
prophet
isaiah
declared
that
the
jewish
sacrifices
had
become
displeasing
to
god
and
would
be
abolished
to
what
purpose
says
the
lord
by
his
prophet
do
you
offer
me
the
multitude
of
your
victims
i
desire
not
holocausts
of
rams
and
blood
of
calves
and
lambs
and
offer
sacrifice
no
more
in
but
did
god
in
rejecting
the
jewish
oblations
intend
to
abolish
sacrifices
altogether
by
no
means
on
the
contrary
he
clearly
predicts
by
the
mouth
of
the
prophet
malachias
that
the
immolations
of
the
jews
would
be
succeeded
by
a
clean
victim
which
would
be
offered
up
not
on
a
single
altar
as
was
the
case
in
jerusalem
but
in
every
part
of
the
known
world
listen
to
the
significant
words
addressed
to
the
jews
by
this
prophet
i
have
no
pleasure
in
you
saith
the
lord
of
hosts
and
i
will
not
receive
a
gift
of
your
hand
for
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
even
to
the
going
down
my
name
is
great
among
the
gentiles
and
in
every
place
there
is
sacrifice
and
there
is
offered
to
my
name
a
clean
oblation
for
my
name
is
great
among
the
gentiles
saith
the
lord
of
the
prophet
here
clearly
foretells
that
an
acceptable
oblation
would
be
offered
to
god
not
by
jews
but
by
gentiles
not
merely
in
jerusalem
but
in
every
place
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
these
prophetic
words
must
have
been
fulfilled
where
shall
we
find
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
we
may
divide
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
into
five
different
classes
of
people
professing
different
forms
of
jews
mohammedans
protestants
and
catholics
among
which
of
these
shall
we
find
the
clean
oblation
of
which
the
prophet
speaks
not
among
the
pagan
nations
for
they
worship
false
gods
and
consequently
can
not
have
any
sacrifice
pleasing
to
the
almighty
not
among
the
jews
for
they
have
ceased
to
sacrifice
altogether
and
the
words
of
the
prophet
apply
not
to
the
jews
but
to
the
gentiles
not
among
the
mohammedans
for
they
also
reject
sacrifices
not
among
any
of
the
protestant
sects
for
they
all
distinctly
repudiate
sacrifices
therefore
it
is
only
in
the
catholic
church
that
is
fulfilled
this
glorious
prophecy
for
whithersoever
you
go
you
will
find
the
clean
oblation
offered
on
catholic
altars
if
you
travel
from
america
to
europe
to
oceanica
to
africa
or
asia
you
will
see
our
altars
erected
and
our
priests
daily
fulfilling
the
words
of
the
prophets
by
offering
the
clean
oblation
of
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
this
oblation
of
the
new
law
is
commonly
called
the
word
mass
is
derived
by
some
from
the
hebrew
term
deut
xvi
which
means
a
free
offering
others
derive
it
from
the
word
which
the
priest
uses
when
he
announces
to
the
congregation
that
divine
service
is
over
it
is
an
expression
indelibly
marked
on
our
english
tongue
from
the
origin
of
our
language
and
we
find
it
embodied
in
such
words
as
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
is
the
consecration
of
the
bread
and
wine
into
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
the
oblation
of
this
body
and
blood
to
god
by
the
ministry
of
the
priest
for
a
perpetual
memorial
of
christ
s
sacrifice
on
the
cross
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
is
identical
with
that
of
the
cross
both
having
the
same
victim
and
high
christ
the
only
difference
consists
in
the
manner
of
the
oblation
christ
was
offered
up
on
the
cross
in
a
bloody
manner
and
in
the
mass
he
is
offered
up
in
an
unbloody
manner
on
the
cross
he
purchased
our
ransom
and
in
the
eucharistic
sacrifice
the
price
of
that
ransom
is
applied
to
our
souls
hence
all
the
efficacy
of
the
mass
is
derived
from
the
sacrifice
of
calvary
it
was
on
the
night
before
he
suffered
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
instituted
the
sacrifice
of
the
new
law
jesus
says
paul
the
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
took
bread
and
giving
thanks
broke
and
said
take
ye
and
eat
this
is
my
body
which
shall
be
delivered
for
you
this
do
for
the
commemoration
of
me
in
like
manner
also
the
chalice
after
he
had
supped
saying
this
chalice
is
the
new
testament
in
my
blood
this
do
ye
as
often
as
you
shall
drink
for
the
commemoration
of
me
for
as
often
as
ye
shall
eat
this
bread
and
drink
the
chalice
ye
shall
show
the
death
of
the
lord
until
he
from
these
words
we
learn
that
the
principal
motive
which
our
savior
had
in
view
in
instituting
the
sacrifice
of
the
altar
was
to
keep
us
in
perpetual
remembrance
of
his
sufferings
and
death
he
wished
that
the
scene
of
calvary
should
ever
appear
in
panoramic
view
before
our
eyes
and
that
our
heart
memory
and
intellect
should
be
filled
with
the
thoughts
of
his
passion
he
knew
well
that
this
would
be
the
best
means
of
winning
our
love
and
exciting
sorrow
for
sin
in
our
soul
therefore
he
designed
that
in
every
church
throughout
the
world
an
altar
should
be
erected
to
serve
as
a
monument
of
his
mercies
to
his
people
as
the
children
of
israel
erected
a
monument
on
crossing
the
jordan
to
commemorate
his
mercies
to
his
chosen
people
the
mass
is
truly
the
memorial
service
of
christ
s
passion
in
compliance
with
the
command
of
our
lord
the
adorable
sacrifice
of
the
altar
has
been
daily
renewed
in
the
church
from
the
death
of
our
savior
till
the
present
time
and
will
be
perpetuated
till
time
shall
be
no
more
in
the
acts
it
is
said
that
while
saul
and
others
were
ministering
or
as
the
greek
text
expresses
it
to
the
lord
and
fasting
the
holy
spirit
said
to
them
set
apart
for
me
saul
and
paul
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
frequently
alludes
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
we
have
an
altar
he
says
whereof
they
can
not
eat
who
serve
the
the
apostle
here
plainly
declares
that
the
christian
church
has
its
altars
as
well
as
the
jewish
synagogue
an
altar
necessarily
supposes
a
sacrifice
without
which
it
has
no
meaning
the
apostle
also
observes
that
the
priesthood
of
the
new
law
was
substituted
for
that
of
the
old
law
now
the
principal
office
of
priests
has
always
been
to
offer
sacrifice
priest
and
sacrifice
are
as
closely
identified
as
judge
and
court
paul
after
david
calls
jesus
a
priest
forever
according
to
the
order
of
he
is
named
a
because
he
offers
sacrifice
a
priest
because
his
sacrifice
is
perpetual
to
the
order
of
because
he
offers
up
consecrated
bread
and
wine
which
were
prefigured
by
the
bread
and
wine
offered
by
melchisedech
the
priest
of
the
most
high
tradition
with
its
hundred
tongues
proclaims
the
perpetual
oblation
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
from
the
time
of
the
apostles
to
our
own
days
if
we
consult
the
fathers
of
the
church
who
have
stood
like
faithful
sentinels
on
the
of
israel
guarding
with
a
jealous
eye
the
deposit
of
faith
and
who
have
been
the
faithful
witnesses
of
their
own
times
and
the
recorders
of
the
past
if
we
consult
the
general
councils
at
which
were
assembled
the
venerable
hierarchy
of
christendom
they
will
all
tell
us
with
one
voice
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
is
the
centre
of
their
religion
and
the
acknowledged
institution
of
jesus
christ
another
remarkable
evidence
in
favor
of
the
divine
institution
of
the
mass
is
furnished
by
the
nestorians
and
eutychians
who
separated
from
the
catholic
church
in
the
fifth
century
and
who
still
exist
in
persia
and
in
other
parts
of
the
east
as
well
as
by
the
greek
schismatics
who
severed
their
connection
with
the
church
in
the
ninth
century
all
these
sects
as
well
as
the
numerous
others
scattered
over
the
east
retain
to
this
day
the
oblation
of
the
mass
in
their
daily
service
as
these
christian
communities
have
had
no
communication
with
the
catholic
church
since
the
period
of
their
separation
from
her
they
could
not
of
course
have
borrowed
from
her
the
doctrine
of
the
eucharistic
sacrifice
consequently
they
must
have
received
it
from
the
same
source
from
which
the
church
derived
it
from
the
apostles
themselves
but
of
all
proofs
in
favor
of
the
apostolic
origin
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
the
most
striking
and
the
most
convincing
is
found
in
the
liturgies
of
the
church
the
liturgy
is
the
established
ritual
of
the
church
it
is
the
collection
of
the
authorized
prayers
of
divine
worship
these
prayers
are
fixed
and
immovable
among
others
we
have
the
liturgy
of
jerusalem
ascribed
to
the
apostle
james
the
liturgy
of
alexandria
attributed
to
mark
the
evangelist
and
the
liturgy
of
rome
referred
to
peter
there
are
various
other
liturgies
accredited
to
the
apostles
or
to
their
immediate
successors
now
i
wish
to
call
your
attention
to
this
remarkable
fact
that
all
these
liturgies
though
compiled
by
different
persons
at
different
times
in
various
places
and
in
divers
languages
contain
without
exception
in
clear
and
precise
language
the
prayers
to
be
said
at
the
celebration
of
mass
prayers
in
substance
the
same
as
those
found
in
our
prayer
books
at
the
canon
of
the
mass
we
can
not
account
for
this
wonderful
uniformity
except
by
supposing
that
the
doctrine
respecting
the
mass
was
received
by
the
apostles
from
the
common
fountain
of
christ
himself
it
was
such
facts
as
these
that
opened
the
eyes
of
those
eminent
english
divines
who
during
the
present
century
have
abandoned
heresy
and
schism
and
rich
preferments
and
who
have
embraced
the
catholic
faith
though
by
taking
such
a
step
they
had
to
sacrifice
all
that
was
dear
to
them
on
earth
the
following
passages
from
paul
s
epistle
to
the
hebrews
are
sometimes
urged
as
an
argument
against
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
christ
neither
by
the
blood
of
goats
or
of
calves
but
by
his
own
blood
entered
once
into
the
holies
having
obtained
eternal
nor
yet
that
he
should
offer
himself
often
as
the
high
priest
entereth
into
the
holies
every
again
every
priest
standeth
indeed
daily
ministering
and
often
offering
the
same
sacrifices
which
can
never
take
away
sins
but
this
man
offering
one
sacrifice
for
sin
forever
sitteth
at
the
right
hand
of
paul
says
that
jesus
was
offered
once
how
then
can
we
offer
him
daily
i
answer
that
jesus
was
offered
once
in
a
bloody
manner
and
it
is
of
this
sacrifice
that
the
apostle
speaks
but
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
he
is
offered
up
in
an
unbloody
manner
though
he
is
daily
offered
on
ten
thousand
altars
the
sacrifice
is
the
same
as
that
of
calvary
having
the
same
high
priest
and
christ
the
object
of
paul
is
to
contrast
the
sacrifice
of
the
new
law
which
has
only
one
victim
with
the
sacrifices
of
the
old
law
where
the
victims
were
many
and
to
show
the
insufficiency
of
the
ancient
sacrifices
and
the
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
new
dispensation
but
if
the
sacrifice
of
the
cross
is
what
need
then
you
will
say
is
there
of
a
commemorative
sacrifice
of
the
mass
i
would
ask
a
protestant
in
return
why
do
you
pray
and
go
to
church
and
why
were
you
baptized
and
receive
communion
and
the
rite
of
confirmation
what
is
the
use
of
all
these
exercises
if
the
sacrifice
of
the
cross
is
you
will
tell
me
that
in
all
these
acts
you
apply
to
yourself
the
merits
of
christ
s
passion
i
will
tell
you
in
like
manner
that
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
i
apply
to
myself
the
merits
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
cross
from
which
the
mass
derives
all
its
efficacy
christ
indeed
by
his
death
made
full
atonement
for
our
sins
but
he
has
not
released
us
from
the
obligation
of
with
him
by
applying
his
merits
to
our
souls
what
better
or
more
efficacious
way
can
we
have
of
participating
in
his
merits
than
by
assisting
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
altar
where
we
vividly
recall
to
mind
his
sufferings
where
calvary
is
represented
before
us
where
we
show
the
death
of
the
lord
until
he
come
and
where
we
draw
abundantly
to
our
souls
the
fruit
of
his
passion
by
drinking
of
the
same
blood
that
was
shed
on
the
cross
in
the
old
law
there
were
different
kinds
of
sacrifices
offered
up
for
different
purposes
there
were
sacrifices
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
god
for
his
benefits
sacrifices
of
propitiation
to
implore
his
forgiveness
for
the
sins
of
the
people
and
sacrifices
of
supplication
to
ask
his
blessing
and
protection
the
sacrifice
of
the
mass
fulfils
all
these
ends
it
is
a
sacrifice
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
a
sacrifice
of
propitiation
and
of
supplication
hence
that
valued
book
the
of
says
when
a
priest
celebrates
mass
he
honors
god
he
rejoices
the
angels
he
edifies
the
church
he
helps
the
living
he
obtains
rest
for
the
dead
and
makes
himself
a
partaker
of
all
that
is
to
form
an
adequate
idea
of
the
efficiency
of
the
divine
sacrifice
of
the
mass
we
have
only
to
bear
in
mind
the
victim
that
is
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
mass
is
a
sacrifice
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
if
all
human
beings
in
this
world
and
all
living
creatures
and
all
inanimate
objects
were
collected
and
burned
as
a
holocaust
to
the
lord
they
would
not
confer
as
much
praise
on
the
almighty
as
a
single
eucharistic
sacrifice
these
earthly
numerous
and
excellent
finite
and
imperfect
while
the
offering
made
in
the
mass
is
of
infinite
value
for
it
is
our
lord
jesus
the
acceptable
lamb
without
blemish
the
beloved
son
in
whom
the
father
is
well
pleased
and
who
is
always
heard
on
account
of
his
with
what
awe
and
grateful
love
should
we
assist
at
this
sacrifice
the
angels
were
present
at
calvary
angels
are
present
also
at
the
mass
if
we
can
not
assist
with
the
seraphic
love
and
rapt
attention
of
the
angelic
spirits
let
us
worship
at
least
with
the
simple
devotion
of
the
shepherds
of
bethlehem
and
the
unswerving
faith
of
the
magi
let
us
offer
to
our
god
the
golden
gift
of
a
heart
full
of
love
and
the
incense
of
our
praise
and
adoration
repeating
often
during
the
holy
oblation
the
words
of
the
psalmist
the
mercies
of
the
lord
i
will
sing
mass
is
also
a
sacrifice
of
propitiation
jesus
daily
pleads
our
cause
in
this
divine
oblation
before
our
heavenly
father
if
any
man
sin
says
john
we
have
an
advocate
with
the
father
jesus
christ
the
just
and
he
is
the
propitiation
for
our
sins
and
not
for
ours
only
but
also
for
those
of
the
whole
hence
the
priest
whenever
he
offers
up
the
holy
sacrifice
recites
this
prayer
at
the
offertory
receive
o
holy
father
almighty
eternal
god
this
immaculate
victim
which
i
thy
unworthy
servant
offer
to
thee
my
living
and
true
god
for
my
innumerable
sins
offences
and
negligences
for
all
here
present
and
for
all
the
faithful
living
and
dead
that
it
may
avail
me
and
them
to
life
whenever
therefore
we
assist
at
mass
let
us
unite
with
jesus
christ
in
imploring
the
mercy
of
god
for
our
sins
let
us
represent
to
ourselves
the
mass
as
another
calvary
which
it
is
in
reality
like
mary
let
us
stand
in
spirit
beneath
the
cross
and
let
our
souls
be
pierced
with
grief
for
our
transgressions
let
us
acknowledge
that
our
sins
were
the
cause
of
that
agony
and
of
the
shedding
of
that
precious
blood
let
us
follow
in
mind
and
heart
that
crowd
of
weeping
penitents
who
accompanied
our
savior
to
calvary
striking
their
breasts
and
let
us
say
spare
o
lord
spare
thy
or
let
us
repeat
with
the
publican
this
heartfelt
prayer
o
god
be
merciful
to
me
a
at
the
death
of
jesus
the
sun
was
darkened
the
earth
trembled
the
very
rocks
were
rent
as
if
to
show
that
even
inanimate
nature
sympathized
with
the
sufferings
of
its
god
and
should
not
we
tremble
for
our
sins
should
not
our
hearts
though
cold
and
hard
as
rocks
be
softened
at
the
spectacle
of
our
god
suffering
for
love
of
us
and
in
expiation
for
our
offences
sacrifice
of
the
mass
is
in
fine
a
sacrifice
of
supplication
for
if
the
blood
of
goats
and
of
oxen
and
the
ashes
of
a
heifer
being
sprinkled
sanctify
such
as
are
defiled
to
the
cleansing
of
the
flesh
how
much
more
shall
the
blood
of
christ
who
through
the
holy
ghost
offered
himself
without
spot
to
god
cleanse
our
conscience
from
dead
works
to
serve
the
living
god
if
the
prayers
of
moses
and
david
and
the
patriarchs
were
so
powerful
in
behalf
of
god
s
servants
what
must
be
the
influence
of
jesus
intercession
if
the
wounds
of
the
martyrs
plead
so
eloquently
for
us
how
much
more
eloquent
is
the
blood
of
jesus
shed
daily
upon
our
altars
his
blood
cries
louder
for
mercy
than
the
blood
of
abel
cried
for
vengeance
if
god
inclines
his
ear
to
us
miserable
sinners
how
can
he
resist
the
pleadings
in
our
behalf
of
the
lamb
of
god
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
let
us
go
therefore
with
confidence
to
the
throne
of
grace
that
we
may
obtain
mercy
and
find
grace
in
seasonable
chapter
xxiv
the
use
of
religious
ceremonies
dictated
by
right
reason
by
religious
ceremonies
we
mean
certain
expressive
signs
and
actions
which
the
church
has
ordained
for
the
worthy
celebration
of
the
divine
service
true
devotion
must
be
interior
and
come
from
the
heart
for
the
true
adorers
shall
adore
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
for
the
father
indeed
seeketh
such
to
worship
him
god
is
a
spirit
and
they
who
worship
him
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
but
we
are
not
to
infer
from
this
that
exterior
worship
is
to
be
contemned
because
interior
worship
is
prescribed
as
essential
on
the
contrary
the
rites
and
ceremonies
enjoined
in
the
worship
of
god
and
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
are
dictated
by
right
reason
are
sanctioned
by
almighty
god
in
the
old
law
and
by
christ
and
his
apostles
in
the
new
the
angels
being
pure
spirits
without
a
body
render
to
god
a
purely
spiritual
worship
the
sun
moon
and
stars
of
the
firmament
pay
him
a
kind
of
external
homage
in
the
prophet
daniel
we
read
sun
and
moon
bless
the
lord
stars
of
heaven
bless
the
lord
praise
and
exalt
him
above
all
the
heavens
show
forth
the
glory
of
god
the
firmament
announces
the
work
of
his
man
by
possessing
a
soul
of
spiritual
substance
partakes
of
the
nature
of
angels
and
by
possessing
a
body
partakes
of
the
nature
of
the
heavenly
bodies
it
is
therefore
his
privilege
as
well
as
his
duty
to
offer
to
god
the
twofold
homage
of
body
and
soul
in
other
words
to
honor
him
by
internal
and
external
worship
genuine
piety
can
not
long
be
concealed
in
the
heart
without
manifesting
itself
by
exterior
practices
of
religion
hence
though
interior
and
exterior
worship
are
distinct
they
can
not
be
separated
in
the
present
life
fire
can
not
burn
without
sending
forth
flame
and
heat
neither
can
the
fire
of
devotion
burn
in
the
soul
without
being
reflected
on
the
countenance
and
even
in
speech
it
is
natural
for
man
to
express
his
sentiments
by
signs
and
ceremonies
for
from
the
fulness
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
and
as
fuel
is
necessary
to
keep
fire
alive
even
so
the
flame
of
piety
is
nourished
by
the
outward
forms
of
religion
a
devoted
child
will
not
be
content
with
loving
his
father
in
his
heart
but
will
manifest
that
love
by
affectionate
language
and
by
the
service
of
his
body
if
necessary
so
will
the
child
of
god
show
his
affection
for
his
heavenly
father
not
only
by
interior
devotion
but
also
by
the
homage
of
his
body
i
beseech
you
says
the
apostle
by
the
mercy
of
god
that
you
present
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
pleasing
unto
god
your
reasonable
the
fruit
of
a
tree
does
not
consist
in
its
bark
its
leaves
and
its
branches
nevertheless
you
never
saw
a
tree
bearing
fruit
unless
when
clothed
with
bark
adorned
with
branches
and
covered
with
leaves
these
are
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
fruit
in
like
manner
though
the
fruit
of
piety
does
not
consist
in
exterior
forms
it
must
however
be
fostered
by
some
outward
observances
or
it
will
soon
decay
there
is
as
close
a
relation
between
devotion
and
ceremonial
as
exists
between
the
bark
and
the
fruit
of
a
tree
the
man
who
daily
bends
his
knee
to
the
maker
who
recites
or
sings
his
praises
who
devoutly
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
who
assists
without
constraint
at
the
public
services
of
the
church
who
observes
an
exterior
decorum
in
the
house
of
god
who
gives
to
the
needy
according
to
his
means
and
duly
attends
to
the
other
practices
and
ceremonies
of
religion
will
generally
be
one
whose
heart
is
united
to
god
and
who
yields
to
him
a
ready
obedience
show
me
on
the
contrary
a
man
who
habitually
neglects
these
outward
observances
of
religion
and
charity
and
i
will
show
you
one
in
whose
soul
the
fire
of
devotion
if
not
quite
extinguished
at
least
burns
very
faintly
the
ceremonies
of
the
church
not
only
render
divine
service
more
solemn
but
also
rivet
our
attention
and
lift
it
up
to
god
our
mind
is
so
active
so
volatile
so
full
of
distractions
our
imagination
so
fickle
that
we
have
need
of
some
external
objects
on
which
to
fix
our
thoughts
almighty
god
considered
ceremonial
so
indispensable
to
interior
worship
that
we
find
him
in
the
old
law
prescribing
in
minute
detail
the
various
rites
ceremonies
and
ordinances
to
be
observed
by
the
jewish
priests
and
people
in
their
public
worship
what
is
the
entire
book
of
leviticus
but
an
elaborate
ritual
of
the
jewish
church
not
indeed
that
external
rites
are
to
be
compared
in
merit
with
interior
worship
but
because
they
are
as
necessary
for
nourishing
internal
devotion
as
food
is
necessary
for
our
animal
life
our
savior
though
he
came
to
establish
a
more
spiritual
religion
than
that
of
the
hebrew
people
did
not
discard
the
outward
forms
of
worship
he
was
accustomed
to
accompany
his
religious
acts
by
appropriate
ceremonies
in
the
garden
of
gethsemani
he
fell
upon
his
face
in
humble
supplication
he
went
in
procession
to
jerusalem
accompanied
by
a
great
multitude
who
sang
hosanna
to
the
son
of
david
at
the
last
supper
he
invoked
a
blessing
on
the
bread
and
wine
and
afterward
chanted
a
hymn
with
his
disciples
when
the
deaf
and
dumb
man
was
brought
to
him
before
healing
him
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
ears
and
touched
his
tongue
with
spittle
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
groaned
and
said
ephpheta
which
is
be
thou
when
he
imparted
the
holy
ghost
to
his
disciples
he
breathed
on
them
and
the
same
apostles
afterward
communicated
the
holy
ghost
to
others
by
laying
hands
on
them
the
apostle
james
directs
that
if
any
man
is
sick
he
shall
call
in
the
priest
who
will
anoint
him
with
oil
now
are
not
all
these
acts
which
i
have
just
prostration
and
procession
the
prayerful
invocation
the
chanting
of
a
hymn
the
touching
of
the
ears
the
lifting
up
of
the
eyes
to
heaven
the
breathing
on
the
apostles
the
laying
on
of
hands
and
the
unction
of
the
not
all
these
acts
so
many
ceremonies
serving
as
models
to
those
which
the
catholic
church
employs
in
her
public
worship
and
in
the
administration
of
her
sacraments
the
ceremonies
now
accompanying
our
public
worship
are
indeed
usually
more
impressive
and
elaborate
than
those
recorded
of
our
savior
but
it
is
quite
natural
that
the
majesty
of
ceremonial
should
keep
pace
with
the
growth
and
development
of
christianity
but
where
shall
we
find
a
ritual
so
gorgeous
as
that
presented
to
us
in
the
book
of
revelation
which
is
descriptive
of
the
worship
of
god
in
the
heavenly
jerusalem
angels
with
golden
censers
stand
before
the
throne
while
elders
cast
their
crowns
of
gold
before
the
lamb
once
slain
then
that
unnumbered
multitude
of
all
nations
tongues
and
people
clothed
in
white
raiment
bearing
palms
of
victory
virgins
too
with
harp
and
canticle
follow
near
the
lamb
singing
the
new
song
which
they
alone
can
utter
how
glorious
the
pageant
how
elaborate
in
detail
surely
there
ought
to
be
some
analogy
and
resemblance
some
proportion
and
harmony
between
the
public
worship
which
is
paid
to
god
in
the
church
militant
on
earth
and
that
which
is
offered
to
him
in
the
church
triumphant
in
heaven
strange
would
it
be
if
god
who
in
the
dispensation
past
and
that
to
come
is
seen
delighting
in
external
majesty
should
have
deprived
the
christian
church
the
living
link
between
the
past
and
the
future
of
all
external
glory
for
as
paul
says
if
the
ministry
of
condemnation
is
glory
much
more
the
ministry
of
justice
aboundeth
in
it
is
true
that
god
uttered
this
complaint
against
the
children
of
israel
this
people
draw
near
me
with
their
mouth
and
honor
me
with
their
lips
but
their
heart
is
far
from
it
is
also
true
that
he
was
displeased
with
their
sacrifices
and
religious
festivals
but
he
blamed
them
not
because
they
praised
him
with
their
voice
but
because
their
hearts
felt
not
what
their
lips
uttered
he
rejected
their
sacrifices
because
they
were
not
accompanied
by
the
more
precious
sacrifice
of
a
penitent
spirit
the
same
lord
who
declares
that
the
true
adorer
shall
adore
the
father
in
spirit
commands
also
that
public
praise
be
given
to
him
in
his
holy
temple
praise
ye
the
lord
he
says
in
his
holy
places
praise
him
with
sound
of
trumpet
praise
him
with
psaltery
and
harp
praise
him
with
timbrel
and
choir
praise
him
with
strings
and
if
he
says
in
one
place
rend
your
hearts
and
not
your
garments
immediately
after
he
adds
blow
the
trumpet
in
sion
sanctify
a
fast
call
a
solemn
assembly
gather
together
the
people
sanctify
the
church
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
the
priests
the
lord
s
ministers
shall
weep
and
shall
say
spare
o
lord
spare
thy
people
the
prophet
first
points
out
the
absolute
necessity
of
interior
sorrow
and
contrition
of
heart
and
then
he
insists
on
the
duty
of
performing
some
acts
of
expiation
penance
and
humiliation
as
you
do
when
you
have
your
forehead
marked
with
ashes
on
ash
wednesday
and
when
you
observe
the
fast
and
abstinence
of
lent
when
paul
says
that
though
he
speak
with
the
tongues
of
angels
and
of
men
and
distribute
all
his
goods
to
feed
the
poor
and
deliver
his
body
to
be
burned
and
have
not
the
love
of
god
it
profiteth
him
nothing
he
points
out
the
necessity
of
interior
worship
and
when
he
says
elsewhere
that
in
the
name
of
jesus
every
knee
should
bend
of
those
that
are
in
heaven
on
earth
and
under
the
earth
he
shows
us
the
duty
of
exterior
or
ceremonial
worship
when
political
leaders
desire
to
influence
the
masses
in
their
favor
they
are
not
content
with
addressing
themselves
to
the
intellect
they
appeal
also
to
the
feelings
and
imagination
they
have
torchlight
processions
accompanied
by
music
discoursing
popular
airs
they
have
flags
and
banners
floating
in
the
breeze
they
have
public
meetings
at
which
they
deliver
patriotic
speeches
to
arouse
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
what
these
men
do
for
political
reasons
the
church
performs
from
the
higher
motives
of
religion
therefore
she
has
her
solemn
processions
she
has
her
heavenly
music
to
soften
the
heart
and
raise
it
to
god
she
consecrates
her
sacred
banners
especially
the
cross
the
banner
of
salvation
she
preaches
with
a
hundred
tongues
speaking
not
only
to
our
head
and
heart
by
the
word
of
god
but
to
our
feelings
and
imagination
by
her
grand
and
imposing
ceremonial
chapter
xxv
ceremonials
of
the
mass
let
us
now
dear
reader
walk
together
into
a
catholic
church
in
time
to
assist
at
the
late
mass
which
is
the
most
solemn
service
of
the
catholic
liturgy
meantime
i
shall
endeavor
to
explain
to
you
the
principal
objects
which
attract
your
attention
as
we
enter
i
dip
my
fingers
into
a
vase
placed
at
the
church
door
and
filled
with
holy
water
and
i
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
praying
at
the
same
time
to
be
purified
from
all
defilement
so
that
with
a
clean
heart
i
may
worship
in
god
s
holy
temple
the
church
through
her
ministers
blesses
everything
used
in
her
service
for
paul
says
that
every
creature
of
god
is
good
that
is
received
with
thanksgiving
for
it
is
sanctified
by
the
word
of
god
and
by
before
mass
begins
the
priest
sprinkles
the
assembled
congregation
with
holy
water
reciting
at
the
same
time
these
words
of
the
fiftieth
psalm
thou
shalt
sprinkle
me
with
hyssop
and
i
shall
be
cleansed
thou
shalt
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
made
whiter
than
the
practice
of
using
blessed
water
dates
back
to
a
very
remote
antiquity
and
is
alluded
to
by
several
fathers
of
the
primitive
church
as
we
advance
up
the
aisle
you
observe
lying
open
on
the
altar
a
large
book
which
is
called
a
or
because
it
contains
the
prayers
said
at
mass
the
office
of
the
mass
consists
of
selections
from
the
old
and
the
new
testament
the
canon
and
other
appropriate
prayers
the
canon
of
the
mass
never
varies
throughout
the
year
and
descends
to
us
from
the
first
ages
of
the
church
with
scarcely
the
addition
of
a
word
nearly
all
the
collects
are
also
very
old
many
of
them
dating
back
to
a
period
prior
to
the
seventh
century
i
am
acquainted
with
no
prayers
that
can
compare
with
the
collects
of
the
missal
in
earnestness
and
vigor
of
language
in
conciseness
of
style
and
unction
of
piety
it
is
evident
that
their
authors
were
men
who
felt
what
they
said
and
were
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
despising
the
persuasive
words
of
human
wisdom
unlike
so
many
modern
whose
rounded
periods
are
directed
rather
to
tickle
the
ears
of
men
than
to
pierce
the
clouds
you
are
probably
familiar
with
the
episcopal
of
common
and
have
no
doubt
admired
its
beautiful
simplicity
of
diction
but
perhaps
you
will
be
surprised
when
i
inform
you
that
this
is
for
the
most
part
a
translation
from
our
missal
let
us
now
reverently
follow
the
officiating
priest
through
the
service
of
the
mass
you
see
him
advance
from
the
sacristy
and
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
where
he
makes
an
humble
confession
of
his
sins
to
god
and
his
saints
he
then
ascends
the
altar
and
nine
times
the
divine
clemency
is
invoked
in
the
eleison
christe
he
intones
the
sublime
doxology
in
excelsis
sings
the
collects
of
the
day
reads
the
lesson
or
epistle
and
chants
the
gospel
after
which
the
sermon
is
usually
preached
next
he
recites
the
nicene
creed
which
for
upwards
of
fifteen
centuries
has
been
resounding
in
the
churches
of
christendom
then
you
perceive
him
making
the
oblation
of
the
bread
and
wine
he
washes
the
tips
of
his
fingers
reciting
the
words
of
the
psalmist
i
will
wash
my
hands
among
the
innocent
and
will
encompass
thy
altar
o
he
is
admonished
by
this
ceremony
to
be
free
from
the
least
stain
in
view
of
the
sacred
act
he
is
going
to
perform
the
preface
and
canon
follow
including
the
solemn
words
of
consecration
during
which
the
bread
and
wine
are
changed
by
the
power
of
jesus
christ
into
his
body
and
blood
he
proceeds
with
other
prayers
including
the
best
of
all
the
as
far
as
the
communion
when
he
partakes
of
the
consecrated
bread
and
chalice
giving
the
holy
communion
afterward
to
such
as
are
prepared
to
receive
it
he
continues
the
mass
gives
his
blessing
to
the
kneeling
congregation
and
concludes
with
the
opening
words
of
the
sublime
gospel
of
john
here
you
have
not
merely
a
number
of
prayers
strung
together
but
you
witness
a
scene
which
rivets
pious
attention
and
warms
the
heart
into
fervent
devotion
you
participate
in
an
act
of
worship
worthy
of
god
to
whom
it
is
offered
but
you
are
anxious
that
i
should
explain
to
you
the
reason
why
the
mass
is
said
in
latin
when
christianity
was
first
established
the
roman
empire
ruled
the
destinies
of
the
world
pagan
rome
had
dominion
over
nearly
all
europe
and
large
portions
of
asia
and
africa
the
latin
was
the
language
of
the
empire
wherever
the
roman
standard
was
planted
there
also
was
spread
the
latin
tongue
just
as
at
the
present
time
the
english
language
is
spoken
wherever
the
authority
of
great
britain
or
of
the
united
states
is
established
the
church
naturally
adopted
in
her
liturgy
or
public
worship
the
language
which
she
then
found
prevailing
among
the
people
the
fathers
of
the
early
church
generally
wrote
in
the
latin
tongue
which
thus
became
the
depository
of
the
treasures
of
sacred
literature
in
the
church
in
the
fifth
century
came
the
disruption
of
the
roman
empire
new
kingdoms
began
to
be
formed
in
europe
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
old
empire
the
latin
gradually
ceased
to
be
a
living
tongue
among
the
people
and
new
languages
commenced
to
spring
up
like
so
many
shoots
from
the
parent
stock
the
church
however
retained
in
her
liturgy
and
in
the
administration
of
the
sacraments
the
latin
language
for
very
wise
reasons
some
of
which
i
shall
briefly
mention
catholic
church
has
always
and
the
same
the
same
form
of
public
worship
the
same
spiritual
government
as
her
doctrine
and
liturgy
are
unchangeable
she
wishes
that
the
language
of
her
liturgy
should
be
fixed
and
uniform
faith
may
be
called
the
jewel
and
language
is
the
casket
which
contains
it
so
careful
is
the
church
of
preserving
the
jewel
intact
that
she
will
not
disturb
even
the
casket
in
which
it
is
set
living
tongues
unlike
a
dead
language
are
continually
changing
in
words
and
meaning
the
english
language
as
written
four
centuries
ago
would
be
now
almost
as
unintelligible
to
an
english
reader
as
the
latin
tongue
in
an
old
bible
published
in
the
fourteenth
century
paul
calls
himself
villain
of
jesus
the
word
in
those
days
meant
a
servant
but
the
term
would
not
be
complimentary
now
to
one
even
less
holy
than
the
apostle
this
is
but
one
instance
out
of
many
which
i
might
adduce
to
show
the
mutations
which
our
language
has
undergone
but
the
latin
being
a
dead
language
is
not
liable
to
these
changes
catholic
church
is
spread
over
the
whole
world
embracing
in
its
fold
children
of
all
climes
and
nations
and
peoples
and
tongues
under
the
sun
how
i
ask
could
the
bishops
of
these
various
countries
communicate
with
one
another
in
council
if
they
had
not
one
language
to
serve
as
a
common
medium
of
communication
it
would
be
simply
impossible
a
church
that
is
universal
must
have
a
universal
tongue
whilst
a
national
church
or
a
church
whose
members
speak
one
and
the
same
language
and
whose
doctrines
conveniently
change
to
suit
the
times
can
safely
adopt
the
vernacular
tongue
in
its
liturgy
a
few
years
ago
a
convocation
was
held
in
england
composed
of
british
and
american
episcopal
bishops
they
had
no
difficulty
in
communicating
with
one
another
because
all
spoke
their
mother
tongue
but
suppose
they
had
representatives
from
spain
france
and
germany
the
lips
of
those
continental
bishops
would
be
sealed
because
they
could
not
speak
to
their
english
brothers
their
ears
also
would
be
sealed
because
they
could
not
comprehend
what
was
said
to
them
in
at
the
ecumenical
council
of
the
vatican
were
assembled
bishops
from
all
parts
of
the
world
speaking
all
the
civilized
languages
of
christendom
had
those
bishops
no
uniform
language
to
express
their
thoughts
public
debates
and
familiar
conversation
among
them
would
have
been
impracticable
the
council
chamber
would
have
been
a
confused
babel
of
tongues
but
thanks
to
the
latin
language
which
they
all
spoke
except
a
few
orientals
their
speeches
were
as
plainly
understood
as
if
each
had
spoken
in
his
native
dialect
the
bishops
and
clergy
of
the
catholic
church
are
in
frequent
correspondence
with
the
holy
see
this
requires
that
they
should
communicate
in
one
uniform
language
otherwise
the
pope
would
be
compelled
to
employ
secretaries
speaking
every
language
in
christendom
but
if
the
priest
says
mass
in
an
unknown
tongue
are
not
the
people
thereby
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
he
says
and
is
not
their
time
wasted
in
church
we
are
forced
to
smile
at
such
charges
which
are
flippantly
repeated
from
year
to
year
these
assertions
arise
from
a
total
ignorance
of
the
mass
many
protestants
imagine
that
the
essence
of
public
worship
consists
in
a
sermon
hence
to
their
minds
the
primary
duty
of
a
congregation
is
to
listen
to
a
discourse
from
the
pulpit
prayer
on
the
contrary
according
to
catholic
teaching
is
the
most
essential
duty
of
a
congregation
though
they
are
also
regularly
instructed
by
sermons
now
what
is
the
mass
it
is
not
a
sermon
but
it
is
a
sacrifice
of
prayer
which
the
priest
offers
up
to
god
for
himself
and
the
people
when
the
priest
says
mass
he
is
speaking
not
to
the
people
but
to
god
to
whom
all
languages
are
equally
intelligible
the
congregation
indeed
could
not
be
expected
to
hear
the
priest
even
if
he
spoke
in
english
since
his
face
is
turned
from
them
and
the
greater
part
of
what
he
says
is
pronounced
in
an
undertone
and
this
was
the
system
of
worship
god
ordained
in
the
ancient
dispensation
as
we
learn
from
the
old
testament
and
from
the
first
chapter
of
luke
the
priest
offered
sacrifice
and
prayed
for
the
people
in
the
sanctuary
while
they
prayed
at
a
distance
in
the
court
in
all
the
schismatic
churches
of
the
east
the
priest
in
the
public
service
prays
not
in
the
vulgar
but
in
a
dead
language
such
also
is
the
practice
in
the
jewish
synagogues
at
this
day
the
rabbi
reads
the
prayers
in
hebrew
a
language
with
which
many
of
the
congregation
are
not
familiar
but
is
it
true
that
the
people
do
not
understand
what
the
priest
says
at
mass
not
at
all
for
by
the
aid
of
an
english
missal
or
any
other
manual
they
are
able
to
follow
the
officiating
clergyman
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
service
you
also
observe
on
the
altar
and
you
desire
to
know
for
what
purpose
they
are
used
in
the
old
law
the
almighty
himself
ordained
that
lighted
chandeliers
should
adorn
the
tabernacle
assuredly
that
can
not
be
improper
in
the
new
dispensation
which
god
sanctioned
in
the
old
the
lights
upon
our
altars
have
both
a
historical
and
a
symbolical
meaning
in
the
primitive
days
of
the
church
christianity
was
not
tolerated
by
the
pagan
world
the
christians
were
consequently
obliged
to
assemble
for
public
worship
in
the
catacombs
of
rome
and
other
secret
places
these
catacombs
or
subterranean
rooms
still
exist
and
are
objects
of
deep
interest
to
the
pious
stranger
visiting
the
eternal
city
as
these
hidden
apartments
did
not
admit
the
light
of
the
sun
the
faithful
were
obliged
to
have
lights
even
in
open
day
in
commemoration
of
the
event
the
church
has
retained
the
use
of
lights
on
her
altars
lighted
candles
have
also
a
symbolical
meaning
they
represent
our
savior
who
is
the
light
of
the
world
who
enlighteneth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
without
whom
we
should
be
wandering
in
darkness
and
in
the
shadow
of
death
they
also
serve
to
remind
us
to
let
our
light
so
shine
before
men
by
our
good
example
that
they
may
see
our
good
works
and
glorify
our
father
who
is
in
lights
are
used
too
as
a
sign
of
spiritual
joy
jerome
who
lived
in
the
fourth
century
remarks
throughout
all
the
churches
of
the
east
before
the
reading
of
the
gospel
candles
are
lighted
at
not
to
dispel
darkness
but
as
a
sign
of
you
also
noticed
the
priest
incensing
the
altar
incense
is
a
striking
emblem
of
prayer
which
should
ascend
to
heaven
from
hearts
burning
with
love
just
as
the
fragrant
smoke
ascends
from
the
censer
let
my
prayer
says
the
royal
prophet
ascend
like
incense
in
thy
god
enjoined
in
the
old
law
the
use
of
incense
aaron
shall
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
in
the
hence
we
see
the
priest
zachariah
offer
incense
on
going
into
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
all
the
multitude
were
praying
without
at
the
hour
of
you
perceive
that
the
altar
is
decorated
today
with
and
because
this
is
a
festival
of
the
church
there
is
one
spot
on
earth
which
can
never
be
too
richly
adorned
and
that
is
the
sanctuary
in
which
our
lord
vouchsafes
to
dwell
among
us
nothing
is
too
good
nothing
too
beautiful
nothing
too
precious
for
god
he
gives
us
all
we
possess
and
the
least
we
can
do
in
return
is
to
ornament
that
spot
which
he
has
chosen
for
his
abode
upon
earth
the
almighty
it
is
true
has
no
need
of
our
gifts
he
is
rich
without
them
the
earth
is
the
lord
s
and
the
fulness
nevertheless
he
is
pleased
to
accept
our
offerings
when
they
are
bestowed
upon
him
as
a
mark
of
our
affection
just
as
a
father
joyfully
receives
from
his
child
a
present
bought
with
his
own
means
our
savior
gratefully
accepted
the
treasures
of
the
magi
though
he
could
have
done
without
such
gifts
some
persons
when
they
see
our
sanctuary
sumptuously
decorated
will
exclaim
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
give
to
the
poor
the
money
spent
in
purchasing
these
things
so
complained
judas
though
caring
not
for
the
poor
when
mary
poured
from
an
alabaster
vase
the
precious
ointment
on
the
feet
of
an
approving
savior
why
should
not
we
imitate
mary
by
placing
at
his
feet
around
his
sanctuary
our
vases
with
their
chaste
and
fragrant
flowers
that
the
church
may
be
filled
with
their
perfume
as
simon
s
house
was
filled
with
the
odor
of
the
ointment
does
not
the
almighty
at
certain
seasons
adorn
with
lilies
and
flowers
of
every
hue
this
earth
which
is
the
great
temple
of
nature
and
what
is
more
appropriate
than
that
we
should
on
special
occasions
embellish
our
sanctuary
the
place
which
he
has
chosen
for
his
habitation
among
us
it
is
sweet
to
snatch
from
the
field
its
fairest
treasures
wherewith
to
beautify
the
temple
made
with
hands
the
which
you
saw
worn
by
the
officiating
priest
must
have
struck
you
as
very
antique
and
out
of
fashion
nor
is
this
surprising
for
if
you
saw
a
lady
enter
church
today
with
a
such
as
worn
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
her
appearance
would
look
to
you
very
singular
now
our
priestly
vestments
are
far
older
in
style
than
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
much
older
even
than
the
british
empire
eusebius
and
other
writers
of
the
fourth
century
speak
of
them
as
already
existing
in
their
times
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
that
these
vestments
look
odd
to
the
unfamiliar
eye
in
the
old
law
god
prescribed
to
the
priests
the
vestments
which
they
should
wear
while
engaged
in
their
sacred
office
and
these
shall
be
the
vestments
which
they
shall
make
for
the
priest
a
rational
and
an
ephod
a
tunic
and
a
straight
linen
garment
a
mitre
and
a
girdle
they
shall
make
the
holy
vestments
for
thy
brother
aaron
and
his
sons
that
they
may
do
the
office
of
priesthood
unto
guided
by
heaven
the
church
also
prescribes
sacred
garments
for
her
ministering
priests
for
it
is
eminently
proper
and
becoming
that
the
minister
of
god
while
engaged
in
the
sacred
mysteries
should
be
arrayed
in
garments
which
would
constantly
impress
upon
him
his
sacred
character
and
remind
him
as
well
as
the
congregation
of
the
sublime
functions
he
is
performing
the
vestments
worn
by
the
priest
while
celebrating
mass
are
an
amict
or
white
cloth
around
the
neck
an
alb
or
white
garment
reaching
to
his
ankles
and
bound
around
his
waist
by
a
cincture
a
maniple
suspended
from
his
left
arm
a
stole
which
is
placed
over
his
shoulders
and
crossed
at
the
breast
and
a
chasuble
or
large
outer
garment
the
chasuble
stole
and
maniple
vary
in
color
according
to
the
occasion
thus
vestments
are
used
at
christmas
easter
and
other
festivals
of
joy
also
on
feasts
of
confessors
and
virgins
are
used
at
pentecost
and
on
festivals
of
apostles
and
martyrs
from
trinity
sunday
to
advent
on
days
having
no
special
feast
during
lent
and
advent
and
in
masses
for
the
dead
one
more
word
on
this
subject
only
a
few
years
ago
the
whole
protestant
world
was
united
in
denouncing
the
use
of
floral
decorations
on
our
altars
incense
sacred
vestments
and
even
the
altar
itself
as
abominations
of
popery
but
of
late
a
better
spirit
has
taken
possession
of
a
respectable
portion
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
after
having
exhausted
their
wrath
against
our
vestments
and
vilified
them
as
the
rags
of
the
wicked
woman
of
babylon
the
members
of
the
ritualistic
church
have
with
remarkable
dexterity
passed
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
they
don
our
vestments
they
swing
our
censer
erect
altars
in
their
churches
and
adorn
them
with
flowers
and
these
ritualists
are
however
easily
discerned
from
the
true
priest
should
one
of
them
ever
appear
before
the
father
of
the
faithful
in
these
robes
the
venerable
pontiff
would
exclaim
with
the
patriarch
of
old
the
voice
indeed
is
the
voice
of
jacob
but
the
hands
are
the
hands
of
i
feel
the
garment
of
the
priest
but
i
hear
the
voice
of
the
parson
god
grant
that
as
our
misguided
brothers
have
assumed
our
sacerdotal
garments
they
may
adopt
our
faith
that
their
speech
may
conform
to
their
dress
then
having
laid
aside
their
earthly
stoles
may
they
deserve
like
all
faithful
priests
to
be
seen
standing
before
the
throne
and
in
sight
of
the
lamb
with
white
stoles
and
palms
in
their
hands
saying
salvation
to
our
god
who
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
to
the
chapter
xxvi
the
sacrament
of
penance
i
the
divine
institution
of
the
sacrament
of
penance
the
whole
history
of
jesus
christ
is
marked
by
mercy
and
compassion
for
suffering
humanity
from
the
moment
of
his
incarnation
till
the
hour
of
his
death
every
thought
and
word
and
act
of
his
divine
life
was
directed
toward
the
alleviation
of
the
ills
and
miseries
of
fallen
man
as
soon
as
he
enters
on
his
public
career
he
goes
about
doing
good
to
all
men
he
gives
sight
to
the
blind
hearing
to
the
deaf
vigor
to
paralyzed
limbs
he
applies
the
salve
of
comfort
to
the
bleeding
heart
and
raises
the
dead
to
life
but
while
jesus
occupied
himself
in
bringing
relief
to
corporal
infirmities
principal
object
of
his
mission
was
to
release
the
soul
from
the
bonds
of
the
very
name
of
jesus
indicates
this
important
truth
thou
shalt
call
his
name
jesus
says
the
angel
for
he
shall
save
his
people
from
their
for
if
jesus
had
contented
himself
with
healing
the
maladies
of
our
body
without
attending
to
those
of
our
soul
he
would
deserve
indeed
to
be
called
our
physician
but
would
not
merit
the
more
endearing
titles
of
savior
and
redeemer
but
as
sin
was
the
greatest
evil
of
man
and
as
jesus
came
to
remove
from
us
our
greatest
evils
he
came
into
the
world
chiefly
as
the
great
absolver
from
sin
magdalen
seems
to
have
a
consciousness
of
this
she
casts
herself
at
his
feet
which
she
washes
with
her
tears
and
wipes
with
her
hair
while
jesus
pronounces
over
her
the
saving
words
of
absolution
the
very
demons
recognized
jesus
as
the
enemy
of
sin
for
they
dreaded
his
approach
knowing
that
he
would
drive
them
out
of
the
bodies
of
men
our
lord
makes
the
healing
of
the
body
secondary
to
that
of
the
soul
when
he
delivers
the
body
from
its
distempers
his
object
is
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
spectators
by
compelling
them
to
recognize
him
as
the
soul
s
physician
he
says
for
instance
to
the
palsied
man
thy
sins
are
the
scribes
are
offended
at
our
savior
for
presuming
to
forgive
sins
he
replies
in
substance
if
you
do
not
believe
my
words
believe
my
acts
and
he
at
once
heals
the
man
of
his
disease
after
he
had
cured
the
man
that
had
been
languishing
for
years
he
whispered
to
him
this
gentle
admonition
sin
no
more
lest
some
worst
thing
may
happen
to
as
much
as
our
spiritual
substance
excels
the
flesh
that
surrounds
it
so
much
more
did
our
savior
value
the
resurrection
of
a
soul
from
the
grave
of
sin
than
the
resurrection
of
the
body
from
that
of
death
hence
augustine
pointedly
remarks
that
while
the
gospel
relates
only
three
resurrections
of
the
body
our
lord
during
his
mortal
life
raised
thousands
of
souls
to
the
life
of
grace
as
the
church
was
established
by
jesus
christ
to
perpetuate
the
work
which
he
had
begun
it
follows
that
the
reconciliation
of
sinners
to
god
was
to
be
the
principal
office
of
sacred
ministers
but
the
important
question
here
presents
itself
how
was
man
to
obtain
forgiveness
in
the
church
after
our
lord
s
ascension
was
jesus
christ
to
appear
in
person
to
every
sinful
soul
and
say
to
each
penitent
as
he
said
to
magdalen
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
or
did
he
intend
to
delegate
this
power
of
forgiving
sins
to
ministers
appointed
for
that
purpose
we
know
well
that
our
savior
never
promised
to
present
himself
visibly
to
each
sinner
nor
has
he
done
so
his
plan
therefore
must
have
been
to
appoint
ministers
of
reconciliation
to
act
in
his
name
it
has
always
indeed
been
the
practice
of
almighty
god
both
in
the
old
and
the
new
law
to
empower
human
agents
to
execute
his
merciful
designs
when
jehovah
resolved
to
deliver
the
children
of
israel
from
the
captivity
of
egypt
he
appointed
moses
their
deliverer
when
god
wished
them
to
escape
from
the
pursuit
of
pharaoh
across
the
red
sea
did
he
intervene
directly
no
but
by
his
instructions
moses
raised
his
hand
over
the
waters
and
they
were
instantly
divided
when
the
people
were
dying
from
thirst
in
the
desert
did
god
come
visibly
to
their
rescue
no
but
moses
struck
the
rock
from
which
the
water
instantly
issued
when
paul
breathing
vengeance
against
the
christians
was
going
to
damascus
did
our
savior
personally
restore
his
sight
convert
and
baptize
him
no
he
sent
paul
to
his
servant
ananias
who
restored
his
sight
and
baptized
him
the
same
apostle
beautifully
describes
to
us
in
one
sentence
of
his
epistle
to
the
corinthians
the
arrangement
of
divine
providence
in
the
reconciliation
of
sinners
god
he
says
hath
reconciled
us
to
himself
through
christ
hath
given
to
us
the
ministry
of
for
christ
therefore
we
are
ambassadors
god
as
it
were
exhorting
through
that
is
to
say
god
sends
christ
to
reconcile
sinners
christ
sends
us
we
are
his
ambassadors
reconciling
sinners
in
his
name
when
i
think
of
this
tremendous
power
that
we
possess
i
congratulate
the
members
of
the
church
for
whose
benefit
it
is
conferred
i
tremble
for
myself
and
my
for
terrible
is
our
responsibility
while
we
have
nothing
to
glory
in
christ
is
the
living
fountain
of
grace
we
are
but
the
channels
through
which
it
is
conveyed
to
your
souls
christ
is
the
treasure
we
are
but
the
that
carry
it
we
bear
this
treasure
in
earthen
christ
is
the
shepherd
we
are
the
pipe
he
uses
to
call
his
sheep
our
words
sounding
in
the
confessional
are
but
the
feeble
echo
of
the
voice
of
the
spirit
of
god
that
purified
the
apostles
in
the
cenacle
of
jerusalem
but
have
we
gospel
authority
to
show
that
our
savior
did
confer
on
the
apostles
and
their
successors
the
power
to
forgive
sins
we
have
the
most
positive
testimony
and
our
savior
s
words
conferring
this
power
are
expressed
in
the
plainest
language
which
admits
of
no
misconception
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
our
savior
thus
addresses
peter
thou
art
peter
and
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
i
will
give
to
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
also
in
and
to
all
the
apostles
assembled
together
on
another
occasion
he
uses
the
same
forcible
language
whatsoever
you
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
you
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
also
in
the
soul
is
enchained
by
sin
i
give
you
power
says
our
lord
to
release
the
penitent
soul
from
its
galling
fetters
and
to
restore
it
to
the
liberty
of
a
child
of
god
in
the
gospel
of
john
we
have
a
still
more
striking
declaration
of
the
absolving
power
given
by
our
savior
to
his
apostles
jesus
after
his
resurrection
thus
addresses
his
disciples
peace
be
to
you
as
the
father
hath
sent
me
i
also
send
you
receive
ye
the
holy
ghost
whose
sins
ye
shall
forgive
they
are
forgiven
them
and
whose
sins
ye
shall
retain
they
are
that
peace
which
i
give
to
you
you
will
impart
to
repentant
souls
as
a
pledge
of
their
reconciliation
with
god
the
absolving
power
i
have
from
my
father
the
same
i
communicate
to
you
receive
the
holy
ghost
that
you
may
impart
this
holy
spirit
to
souls
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
evil
if
their
sins
are
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
made
as
white
as
snow
and
if
they
be
red
as
crimson
they
shall
be
white
as
if
they
are
as
numerous
as
the
sands
on
the
seashore
they
shall
be
blotted
out
provided
they
come
to
you
with
contrite
hearts
the
sentence
of
mercy
which
you
shall
pronounce
on
earth
i
will
ratify
in
heaven
from
these
words
of
john
i
draw
three
important
conclusions
it
follows
first
that
the
forgiving
power
was
not
restricted
to
the
apostles
but
extended
to
their
successors
in
the
ministry
unto
all
times
and
places
the
forgiveness
of
sin
was
to
continue
while
sin
lasted
in
the
world
and
as
sin
alas
will
always
be
in
the
world
so
will
the
remedy
for
sin
be
always
in
the
church
the
medicine
will
with
the
disease
the
power
which
our
lord
gave
the
apostles
to
preach
to
baptize
to
confirm
to
ordain
was
transmitted
by
them
to
their
successors
why
not
also
the
power
which
they
had
received
to
forgive
sins
since
man
s
greatest
need
is
his
reconciliation
with
god
by
the
forgiveness
of
his
offences
it
follows
secondly
that
forgiveness
of
sin
was
ordinarily
to
be
obtained
only
through
the
ministry
of
the
apostles
and
their
successors
just
as
it
was
from
them
that
the
people
were
to
receive
the
word
of
god
and
the
grace
of
baptism
the
pardoning
power
was
a
great
prerogative
conferred
on
the
apostles
but
what
kind
of
prerogative
would
it
be
if
people
could
always
obtain
forgiveness
by
confessing
to
god
secretly
in
their
rooms
how
few
would
have
recourse
to
the
apostles
if
they
could
obtain
forgiveness
on
easier
terms
god
says
to
his
chosen
ministers
i
give
you
the
keys
of
my
kingdom
that
you
may
dispense
the
treasures
of
mercy
to
repenting
sinners
but
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
give
the
apostles
the
keys
of
god
s
treasures
for
the
ransom
of
sinners
if
every
sinner
could
obtain
his
ransom
without
applying
to
the
apostles
if
i
gave
you
dear
reader
the
keys
of
my
house
authorizing
you
to
admit
whom
you
please
that
they
might
partake
of
the
good
things
contained
in
it
you
would
conclude
that
i
had
done
you
a
small
favor
if
you
discovered
that
every
one
was
possessed
of
a
private
key
and
could
enter
when
he
pleased
without
consulting
you
i
have
said
that
forgiveness
of
sins
is
to
be
obtained
through
the
ministry
of
the
apostles
and
of
their
successors
because
it
may
sometimes
happen
that
the
services
of
god
s
minister
can
not
be
obtained
a
merciful
lord
will
not
require
in
this
conjuncture
more
than
a
hearty
sorrow
for
sin
joined
with
a
desire
of
having
recourse
as
soon
as
practicable
to
the
tribunal
of
penance
for
god
s
ordinances
bind
only
such
as
are
able
to
fulfil
them
it
follows
in
the
third
place
that
the
power
of
forgiving
sins
on
the
part
of
god
s
minister
involves
the
obligation
of
confessing
them
on
the
part
of
the
sinner
the
priest
is
not
empowered
to
give
absolution
to
every
one
indiscriminately
he
must
exercise
the
power
with
judgment
and
discretion
he
must
reject
the
impenitent
and
absolve
the
penitent
but
how
will
he
judge
of
the
disposition
of
the
sinner
unless
he
knows
his
sins
and
how
will
the
priest
know
his
sins
unless
they
are
confessed
hence
we
are
not
surprised
when
we
read
in
the
acts
that
many
of
them
who
believed
came
confessing
and
declaring
their
deeds
to
the
apostles
why
did
they
confess
their
sins
unless
they
were
bound
to
do
so
hence
also
we
understand
why
john
says
if
we
confess
our
sins
he
is
faithful
and
just
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
cleanse
us
from
all
the
strength
of
these
texts
of
scripture
will
appear
to
you
much
more
forcible
when
you
are
told
that
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
from
the
first
to
the
last
insist
upon
the
necessity
of
sacramental
confession
as
a
divine
institution
we
are
not
unfrequently
told
by
those
who
are
little
acquainted
with
the
doctrine
and
history
of
the
church
that
sacramental
confession
was
not
introduced
into
the
church
until
years
after
the
time
of
our
savior
in
vindication
of
their
bold
assertion
they
even
introduce
quotations
from
ss
basil
ambrose
augustine
jerome
and
chrysostom
these
quotations
are
utterly
irrelevant
but
if
seen
in
the
context
they
will
tend
to
prove
instead
of
disproving
the
catholic
doctrine
of
confession
for
the
sake
of
brevity
i
shall
cite
only
a
few
passages
from
the
fathers
referred
to
these
citations
i
take
almost
at
random
from
the
copious
writings
of
these
fathers
on
confession
from
these
extracts
you
can
judge
of
the
sentiments
of
all
the
fathers
on
the
subject
of
confession
uno
disce
st
basil
writes
in
the
confession
of
sins
the
same
method
must
be
observed
as
in
laying
open
the
infirmities
of
the
body
for
as
these
are
not
rashly
communicated
to
every
one
but
to
those
only
who
understand
by
what
method
they
may
be
cured
so
the
confession
of
sins
must
be
made
to
such
persons
as
have
the
power
to
apply
a
later
on
he
tells
us
who
those
persons
are
necessarily
our
sins
must
be
confessed
to
those
to
whom
has
been
committed
the
dispensation
of
the
mysteries
of
god
thus
also
are
they
found
to
have
acted
who
did
penance
of
old
in
regard
of
the
saints
it
is
written
in
the
acts
they
confessed
to
the
apostles
by
whom
also
they
were
two
conclusions
obviously
follow
from
these
passages
of
st
basil
first
the
necessity
of
confession
second
the
obligation
of
declaring
our
sins
to
a
priest
to
whom
in
the
new
law
is
committed
the
dispensation
of
the
mysteries
of
ambrose
of
milan
writes
the
poison
is
sin
the
remedy
the
accusation
of
one
s
crime
the
poison
is
iniquity
confession
is
the
remedy
of
the
relapse
and
therefore
it
is
truly
a
remedy
against
poison
if
thou
declare
thine
iniquities
that
thou
mayest
be
justified
art
thou
ashamed
this
shame
will
avail
thee
little
at
the
judgment
seat
of
the
following
passage
clearly
shows
that
the
great
light
of
the
church
of
milan
is
speaking
of
confession
to
priests
there
are
some
continues
ambrose
who
ask
for
penance
that
they
may
at
once
be
restored
to
communion
these
do
not
so
much
desire
to
be
loosed
as
to
bind
the
priest
for
they
do
not
unburden
their
conscience
but
they
burden
his
who
is
commanded
not
to
give
holy
things
unto
is
not
easily
to
admit
impure
souls
to
the
holy
paulinus
the
secretary
of
ambrose
in
his
life
of
that
great
bishop
relates
that
he
used
to
weep
over
the
penitents
whose
confessions
he
heard
augustine
writes
our
merciful
god
wills
us
to
confess
in
this
world
that
we
may
not
be
confounded
in
the
and
again
let
no
one
say
to
himself
i
do
penance
to
god
in
private
i
do
it
before
god
is
it
then
in
vain
that
christ
hath
said
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
is
it
in
vain
that
the
keys
have
been
given
to
the
church
do
we
make
void
the
gospel
void
the
words
of
christ
in
this
extract
how
well
doth
the
great
doctor
meet
the
sophistry
of
those
who
in
our
times
say
that
it
is
sufficient
to
confess
to
god
chrysostom
in
his
thirtieth
homily
says
lo
we
have
now
at
length
reached
the
close
of
holy
lent
now
especially
we
must
press
forward
in
the
career
of
fasting
and
exhibit
a
and
confession
of
our
that
with
these
good
works
having
come
to
the
day
of
easter
we
may
enjoy
the
bounty
of
the
lord
for
as
the
enemy
knows
that
having
confessed
our
sins
and
our
wounds
to
the
we
attain
to
an
abundant
cure
he
in
an
especial
manner
opposes
again
he
says
do
not
to
only
of
fornication
nor
of
those
things
that
are
manifest
among
all
men
but
bring
together
also
thy
secret
calumnies
and
evil
speakings
and
all
such
the
great
doctor
plainly
enjoins
here
a
detailed
and
specific
confession
of
our
sins
not
to
god
but
to
his
minister
as
the
whole
context
evidently
shows
the
same
father
in
an
eloquent
treatise
on
the
power
of
the
sacred
ministry
uses
the
following
words
to
the
priests
is
given
a
power
which
god
would
not
grant
either
to
angels
or
archangels
inasmuch
that
what
the
priests
do
below
god
ratifies
above
and
the
master
confirms
the
sentence
of
his
servants
for
he
says
whose
sins
you
shall
retain
they
are
what
power
i
ask
can
be
greater
than
this
the
father
hath
given
all
power
to
the
son
and
i
see
all
this
same
power
delivered
to
them
by
god
the
son
to
cleanse
the
leprosy
of
the
body
or
rather
to
pronounce
it
cleansed
was
given
to
the
jewish
priests
alone
but
to
our
priests
is
granted
the
power
not
of
declaring
healed
the
leprosy
of
the
body
but
of
absolutely
cleansing
the
defilements
of
the
and
again
if
a
sinner
as
becomes
him
would
use
the
aid
of
his
conscience
and
hasten
to
confess
his
crimes
and
disclose
his
ulcer
to
his
physician
who
may
heal
and
not
reproach
and
receive
remedies
from
him
if
he
would
speak
to
him
alone
without
the
knowledge
of
any
one
and
with
care
lay
all
before
him
easily
would
he
amend
his
failings
the
confession
of
sins
is
the
absolution
of
jerome
writes
if
the
serpent
the
devil
secretly
bite
a
man
and
thus
infect
him
with
the
poison
of
sin
and
this
man
shall
remain
silent
and
do
not
penance
nor
be
willing
to
make
known
his
wound
to
his
brother
and
master
the
master
who
has
a
tongue
that
can
heal
can
not
easily
serve
him
for
if
the
ailing
man
be
ashamed
to
open
his
case
to
the
physician
no
cure
can
be
expected
for
medicine
does
not
cure
that
of
which
it
knows
elsewhere
he
says
with
us
the
bishop
or
priest
binds
or
them
who
are
merely
innocent
or
heard
as
his
duty
requires
the
various
qualities
of
he
understands
who
should
be
bound
and
who
could
the
catholic
doctrine
regarding
the
power
of
the
priests
and
the
obligation
of
confession
be
expressed
in
stronger
language
than
this
and
yet
these
are
the
very
fathers
who
are
represented
to
be
opposed
to
sacramental
confession
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
unanimous
voice
of
antiquity
our
adversaries
have
the
hardihood
to
assert
that
private
or
sacramental
confession
was
introduced
at
a
period
subsequent
to
the
twelfth
century
they
do
not
however
vouchsafe
to
inform
us
by
what
pope
or
bishop
or
father
of
the
church
or
by
what
council
or
in
what
country
this
monstrous
innovation
was
foisted
on
the
christian
republic
surely
an
institution
which
in
their
estimation
has
been
fraught
with
such
dire
calamity
to
christendom
ought
to
have
its
origin
marked
with
more
precision
it
is
sometimes
prudent
however
not
to
be
too
particular
in
fixing
dates
i
shall
now
i
trust
show
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
reader
sacramental
confession
was
not
introduced
it
could
not
have
been
introduced
into
the
church
since
the
days
of
the
apostles
and
consequently
that
it
is
apostolic
in
its
origin
that
confession
was
not
invented
since
the
days
of
the
apostles
is
manifest
as
soon
as
we
attempt
to
fix
the
period
of
its
first
establishment
let
us
go
back
step
by
step
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
first
century
it
had
not
its
origin
in
the
present
century
as
everybody
will
admit
nor
did
it
arise
in
the
sixteenth
century
since
the
general
council
of
trent
held
in
that
age
speaks
of
it
as
an
established
and
venerable
institution
and
luther
says
that
auricular
confession
as
now
in
vogue
is
useful
nay
necessary
nor
would
i
he
adds
have
it
abolished
since
it
is
the
remedy
of
afflicted
even
henry
before
he
founded
a
new
sect
wrote
a
treatise
in
defence
of
the
sacraments
including
penance
and
confession
it
was
not
introduced
in
the
thirteenth
century
for
the
fourth
council
of
lateran
passed
a
decree
in
obliging
the
faithful
to
confess
their
sins
at
least
once
a
year
this
decree
of
course
supposes
confession
to
be
already
an
established
fact
some
protestant
writers
fall
into
a
common
error
in
interpreting
the
decree
of
the
lateran
council
by
saying
sacramental
confession
was
never
required
in
the
church
of
rome
until
the
thirteenth
the
council
simply
prescribed
a
limit
beyond
which
the
faithful
should
not
defer
their
confession
these
writers
seem
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
a
law
obliging
us
to
a
certain
duty
and
a
statute
fixing
the
time
for
fulfilling
it
they
might
as
well
suppose
that
the
revenue
officer
creates
the
law
regarding
the
payment
of
taxes
when
he
issues
a
notice
requiring
the
revenue
to
be
paid
within
a
given
time
going
back
to
the
ninth
century
we
find
that
confession
could
not
have
had
its
rise
then
it
was
at
that
period
that
the
greek
schism
took
its
rise
under
the
leadership
of
photius
the
greek
schismatic
church
has
remained
since
then
a
communion
separate
from
the
catholic
church
having
no
spiritual
relations
with
us
now
the
greek
church
is
as
tenaciously
attached
to
private
confession
as
we
are
for
the
same
reasons
confession
could
not
date
its
origin
from
the
fifth
or
fourth
century
the
arians
revolted
from
the
church
in
the
fourth
century
and
the
nestorians
and
eutychians
in
the
fifth
the
two
sects
still
exist
in
large
numbers
in
persia
abyssinia
and
along
the
coast
of
malabar
and
retain
confession
as
one
of
their
most
sacred
and
cherished
practices
in
fine
no
human
agency
could
succeed
in
instituting
confession
between
the
first
and
fourth
century
for
the
teachings
of
our
divine
redeemer
and
of
his
disciples
had
made
too
vivid
an
impression
on
the
christian
community
to
be
easily
effaced
and
the
worst
enemies
of
the
church
admit
that
no
spot
or
wrinkle
had
yet
deformed
her
fair
visage
in
this
the
golden
age
of
her
existence
these
remarks
suffice
to
convince
us
that
sacramental
confession
not
instituted
since
the
time
of
the
i
shall
now
endeavor
to
prove
to
your
satisfaction
its
introduction
into
the
church
since
the
apostolic
age
was
absolutely
there
are
two
ways
in
which
we
may
suppose
that
error
might
insinuate
itself
into
the
church
viz
suddenly
or
by
slow
process
now
the
introduction
of
confession
in
either
of
those
ways
was
simply
impossible
first
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
suppose
that
confession
was
immediately
forced
upon
the
christian
world
for
experience
demonstrates
with
what
slowness
and
difficulty
men
are
divested
of
their
religious
impressions
whether
true
or
false
if
such
is
the
case
with
individuals
how
ridiculous
would
it
seem
for
whole
nations
to
adopt
in
a
single
day
some
article
of
belief
which
they
had
never
admitted
before
hence
we
can
not
imagine
without
doing
violence
to
our
good
sense
that
all
the
good
people
of
christendom
went
to
rest
one
night
ignorant
of
the
sacrament
of
penance
and
rose
next
morning
firm
believers
in
the
catholic
doctrine
of
auricular
confession
as
well
might
we
suppose
that
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
would
retire
to
rest
believing
they
were
living
under
a
republic
and
awake
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
they
were
under
the
rule
of
queen
victoria
nor
is
it
less
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
practice
of
confession
was
introduced
by
degrees
how
can
we
imagine
that
the
fathers
of
the
clements
the
leos
the
gregories
the
chrysostoms
the
jeromes
the
basils
and
augustines
those
intrepid
high
priests
of
the
lord
who
in
every
age
at
the
risk
of
persecution
exile
and
death
have
stood
like
faithful
sentinels
on
the
of
israel
defending
with
sleepless
eyes
the
outskirts
of
the
city
of
god
from
the
slightest
can
we
imagine
i
say
that
they
would
suffer
the
enemy
of
truth
to
invade
the
very
sanctuary
of
god
s
temple
if
they
were
so
vigilant
in
cutting
off
the
least
withered
branch
of
error
how
would
they
tamely
submit
to
see
so
monstrous
an
exotic
engrafted
on
the
fruitful
tree
of
the
church
what
gives
additional
weight
to
these
remarks
is
the
reflection
that
confession
is
not
a
speculative
doctrine
but
a
doctrine
of
the
most
practical
kind
influencing
our
daily
actions
words
and
sacrament
to
which
thousands
of
christians
have
constant
recourse
in
every
part
of
the
world
it
is
a
doctrine
moreover
hard
to
flesh
and
blood
and
which
no
human
power
even
if
it
had
the
will
could
impose
on
the
human
race
it
is
only
a
god
that
in
such
a
case
could
exact
the
homage
of
our
assent
in
whatever
light
therefore
we
view
the
present
we
consider
the
circumstances
of
time
place
manner
of
its
same
inevitable
conclusion
stares
us
in
the
face
that
sacramental
confession
is
not
the
invention
of
man
but
the
institution
of
jesus
christ
but
the
doctrine
of
priestly
absolution
and
the
private
confession
of
sins
is
not
confined
to
the
roman
catholic
and
oriental
schismatic
churches
the
same
doctrine
is
also
taught
by
a
large
and
influential
portion
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
england
the
rev
grueber
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
has
recently
published
a
catechism
in
which
the
absolving
power
of
the
minister
of
god
and
the
necessity
and
advantage
of
confession
are
plainly
set
forth
i
will
quote
from
the
rev
gentleman
s
book
his
identical
words
what
do
you
mean
by
absolution
the
pardon
or
forgiveness
of
sin
by
what
special
ordinance
of
christ
are
sins
committed
after
baptism
to
be
pardoned
by
the
sacrament
of
absolution
who
is
the
minister
of
absolution
a
priest
do
you
mean
that
a
priest
can
really
absolve
yes
in
what
place
of
the
holy
scripture
is
it
recorded
that
christ
gave
this
power
to
the
priesthood
in
john
xx
see
also
matt
xviii
what
does
the
or
book
of
common
prayer
say
in
the
office
for
the
ordaining
of
priests
the
bishop
is
directed
to
say
receive
the
holy
ghost
for
the
office
and
work
of
a
priest
in
the
church
of
god
whose
sins
thou
dost
forgive
they
are
in
the
office
for
the
visitation
of
the
sick
it
is
said
our
lord
jesus
christ
hath
left
in
his
church
power
to
absolve
all
sinners
that
truly
repent
and
believe
in
in
the
order
for
morning
and
evening
prayer
we
say
again
almighty
god
hath
given
power
and
commandment
to
his
ministers
to
declare
and
pronounce
to
his
people
being
penitent
the
absolution
and
remission
of
their
for
what
purpose
hath
christ
given
this
power
to
priests
to
pronounce
absolution
in
his
name
the
consolation
of
the
penitent
the
quieting
of
his
what
must
precede
the
absolution
of
the
penitent
before
absolution
privately
given
confession
must
be
made
to
a
priest
privately
in
what
case
does
the
church
of
england
order
her
ministers
to
move
people
to
private
or
as
it
is
called
to
auricular
confession
when
they
feel
their
conscience
troubled
with
any
weighty
matter
what
is
weighty
matter
mortal
sin
certainly
is
weighty
sins
of
omission
or
commission
of
any
kind
that
press
upon
the
mind
are
so
too
anything
may
be
weighty
that
causes
scruple
or
doubtfulness
at
what
times
in
particular
does
the
church
so
order
in
the
time
of
sickness
before
coming
to
the
holy
is
there
any
other
class
of
persons
to
whom
confession
is
profitable
yes
to
those
desire
to
lead
a
saintly
life
these
indeed
are
the
persons
who
most
frequently
resort
to
is
there
any
other
object
in
confession
besides
the
seeking
absolution
for
past
sin
and
the
quieting
of
the
penitent
s
conscience
yes
the
practice
of
confessing
each
single
sin
is
a
great
check
upon
the
commission
of
sin
and
a
preservative
of
purity
of
life
here
we
have
the
divine
institution
of
priestly
absolution
and
the
necessity
and
advantage
of
sacramental
confession
plainly
taught
not
in
a
speculative
treatise
but
in
a
practical
catechism
by
a
distinguished
minister
of
the
church
of
england
taught
by
a
minister
who
draws
his
salary
from
the
funds
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
who
preaches
and
administers
in
a
church
edifice
recognized
as
a
protestant
episcopal
church
and
who
is
in
strict
communion
with
a
bishop
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
of
england
and
these
doctrines
are
upheld
not
by
one
eminent
divine
only
but
by
hundreds
of
clergymen
as
well
as
by
thousands
of
the
protestant
episcopalians
of
england
what
a
strange
spectacle
to
behold
the
same
church
teaching
diametrically
opposite
doctrines
what
is
orthodox
in
the
diocese
of
bath
and
wells
is
decidedly
heterodox
in
the
diocese
of
north
carolina
an
ordinance
which
rev
grueber
proclaims
to
be
of
divine
faith
is
characterized
by
rt
rev
bishop
atkinson
as
the
invention
of
men
what
grueber
inculcates
as
a
most
salutary
practice
atkinson
anathematizes
as
pernicious
to
religion
confession
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
former
is
a
great
check
upon
the
commission
of
sin
is
stigmatized
by
the
latter
as
an
incentive
to
sin
behold
how
good
and
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
dwell
together
in
suppose
that
the
venerable
protestant
episcopal
bishop
of
north
carolina
in
passing
through
england
were
invited
by
the
rev
grueber
to
preach
in
his
church
in
the
morning
and
that
the
rt
rev
prelate
chose
for
his
subject
a
sermon
on
confession
and
suppose
that
the
rev
grueber
selected
in
the
evening
as
the
subject
of
his
discourse
the
doctrine
advanced
by
him
in
his
catechism
let
us
imagine
some
benighted
dissenter
attending
grueber
s
church
at
the
morning
and
evening
service
with
the
view
to
being
enlightened
in
the
teachings
of
the
protestant
church
would
not
our
dissenter
be
sorely
perplexed
on
returning
home
at
night
as
to
what
the
protestant
episcopal
church
really
some
episcopalians
are
pleased
to
admit
that
confession
may
be
resorted
to
with
spiritual
profit
in
certain
abnormal
instance
in
time
of
sickness
so
that
in
their
judgment
a
religious
observance
which
is
salutary
to
a
sick
man
is
pernicious
to
him
in
good
health
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
how
the
circumstances
of
bodily
health
can
affect
the
moral
character
of
a
religious
act
that
a
minister
of
the
baptist
or
the
methodist
church
should
deny
the
power
of
priestly
absolution
i
readily
understand
since
these
churches
disclaim
in
their
confessions
of
faith
any
such
prerogative
for
their
clergy
but
i
can
not
well
conceive
why
a
protestant
episcopalian
should
repudiate
the
pardoning
power
which
is
plainly
asserted
in
his
standard
whenever
an
episcopalian
bishop
imposes
hands
on
candidates
for
the
ministry
he
employs
the
following
words
which
are
found
in
the
book
of
common
prayer
receive
the
holy
ghost
for
the
office
and
work
of
a
priest
in
the
church
of
god
now
committed
unto
thee
by
the
imposition
of
our
hands
whose
sins
thou
dost
forgive
they
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
thou
dost
retain
they
are
if
these
words
do
not
mean
that
the
minister
receives
by
the
imposition
of
the
bishop
s
hands
the
power
of
forgiving
sin
they
mean
nothing
at
all
when
the
bishop
pronounces
this
sentence
either
he
intends
to
convey
this
power
of
absolution
or
he
does
not
if
he
intended
to
confer
this
power
he
could
not
employ
more
clear
and
precise
language
to
express
his
idea
if
he
did
not
intend
to
confer
this
power
then
his
language
is
calculated
to
mislead
just
imagine
that
prelate
addressing
a
candidate
for
holy
orders
in
the
morning
with
the
words
whose
sins
thou
dost
forgive
they
are
forgiven
and
after
divine
service
saying
to
the
young
minister
remember
sir
you
have
no
power
to
forgive
sins
the
words
of
ordination
are
a
mere
figure
of
when
a
catholic
bishop
ordains
priests
he
uses
the
precise
words
which
i
have
quoted
because
the
book
of
common
prayer
borrows
them
from
our
pontifical
but
he
means
exactly
what
he
says
viz
that
the
priest
receives
through
the
ministration
of
the
bishop
the
power
of
forgiving
sins
to
sum
up
we
have
seen
that
the
sacrament
of
penance
and
absolution
by
the
priest
is
taught
in
scripture
proclaimed
by
the
fathers
upheld
not
only
by
roman
catholics
throughout
the
world
but
also
by
all
the
schismatic
christians
of
the
east
it
is
inculcated
in
those
old
and
genuine
editions
of
the
of
common
which
have
not
been
enervated
by
being
subjected
to
the
in
this
country
and
the
same
practice
is
encouraged
by
an
influential
portion
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
in
england
and
i
will
add
also
in
the
united
states
again
some
object
to
priestly
absolution
on
the
assumption
that
the
exercise
of
such
a
function
would
be
a
usurpation
of
an
incommunicable
prerogative
of
god
who
alone
can
forgive
sins
this
was
precisely
the
language
addressed
by
the
scribes
to
our
savior
they
exclaimed
he
blasphemeth
who
can
forgive
sins
but
god
only
my
answer
therefore
will
be
equally
applicable
to
old
and
modern
objectors
it
is
not
blasphemy
for
a
priest
to
claim
the
power
of
forgiving
sins
since
he
acts
as
the
delegate
of
the
most
high
it
would
indeed
be
blasphemous
if
a
priest
pretended
to
absolve
in
his
own
name
and
by
virtue
of
his
own
authority
but
when
the
priest
absolves
the
penitent
sinner
he
acts
in
the
name
and
by
the
express
authority
of
jesus
christ
for
he
says
i
absolve
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
of
the
son
and
of
the
holy
let
it
be
understood
once
for
all
that
the
priest
arrogates
to
himself
no
divine
powers
he
is
but
a
feeble
voice
it
is
the
holy
spirit
that
operates
sanctity
in
the
soul
of
the
penitent
not
a
few
protestant
episcopalians
i
believe
still
admit
that
original
sin
is
washed
away
in
the
sacrament
of
baptism
if
the
minister
is
not
guilty
of
blasphemy
in
being
the
instrument
of
god
s
mercy
in
forgiving
sins
by
baptism
how
can
a
priest
blaspheme
in
being
the
instrument
of
divine
mercy
in
absolving
sinners
in
the
sacrament
of
penance
the
same
lord
who
instituted
baptism
for
the
remission
of
original
sin
established
penance
for
the
forgiveness
of
sins
committed
after
baptism
did
not
the
apostles
exercise
divine
power
in
raising
dead
bodies
to
life
and
in
raising
souls
that
were
dead
to
the
life
of
grace
and
yet
no
one
but
scribes
and
pharisees
accused
them
of
usurping
god
s
powers
can
not
the
almighty
without
derogating
from
his
own
glory
give
to
men
in
the
nineteenth
century
privileges
which
he
accorded
to
them
in
the
first
age
of
the
church
far
then
from
dishonoring
we
honor
god
by
having
recourse
to
the
earthly
physician
whom
he
has
appointed
for
us
and
like
the
multitude
in
the
gospel
we
glorify
god
who
hath
given
such
power
to
others
object
thus
why
confess
to
a
priest
when
you
may
confess
to
god
in
secret
i
will
retort
by
asking
why
do
you
build
fine
temples
when
you
can
worship
god
in
the
great
temple
of
nature
why
pray
in
church
when
you
can
pray
in
your
chamber
why
listen
to
a
minister
expounding
the
word
of
god
when
you
can
read
the
gospel
at
your
leisure
at
home
you
answer
that
the
lord
authorizes
these
things
so
does
he
authorize
priestly
absolution
this
objection
is
not
new
it
is
very
old
augustine
who
lived
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
will
answer
the
objection
for
me
let
no
one
remarks
this
illustrious
doctor
say
to
himself
i
do
penance
to
god
in
private
i
do
it
before
god
is
it
then
in
vain
that
christ
has
said
whatsoever
ye
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
is
it
in
vain
that
the
keys
have
been
given
to
the
church
the
question
for
us
is
not
what
god
is
able
to
do
but
what
has
willed
to
god
have
adopted
other
means
for
the
justification
of
the
sinner
as
he
might
have
created
a
world
different
from
the
present
one
but
it
is
our
business
to
take
our
father
at
his
word
and
to
have
recourse
with
gratitude
to
the
system
he
has
actually
established
for
our
justification
now
we
are
assured
by
his
infallible
word
that
it
is
by
having
recourse
to
his
consecrated
ministers
that
our
sins
will
be
forgiven
us
it
is
related
in
the
book
of
kings
that
naaman
the
syrian
was
afflicted
with
a
grievous
leprosy
which
baffled
the
skill
of
the
physicians
of
his
country
he
had
in
his
household
a
jewish
she
spoke
to
her
master
of
the
great
prophet
eliseus
who
lived
in
her
native
country
to
whom
the
lord
had
given
the
power
of
performing
miracles
she
besought
her
master
to
consult
the
prophet
naaman
accordingly
set
out
for
the
country
of
israel
and
begged
eliseus
to
heal
him
the
prophet
told
him
to
go
and
wash
seven
times
in
the
jordan
but
naaman
instead
of
doing
as
he
was
directed
became
very
angry
and
said
i
thought
he
would
have
come
out
to
me
and
touched
with
his
hand
the
place
of
the
leprosy
and
healed
me
are
not
the
abana
and
the
pharfar
rivers
of
damascus
better
than
all
the
waters
of
israel
that
i
may
wash
in
them
and
be
made
clean
but
the
servants
of
naaman
remonstrated
with
him
and
besought
him
to
comply
with
the
prophet
s
injunction
telling
him
that
the
conditions
were
easy
and
the
jordan
was
at
hand
naaman
went
and
washed
and
was
cleansed
our
opponents
like
naaman
cry
out
why
should
you
go
to
a
priest
a
sinner
like
yourself
when
secretly
in
your
own
room
you
can
approach
god
the
pure
fountain
of
grace
to
be
washed
from
your
sins
i
answer
because
jesus
christ
a
prophet
and
more
than
a
prophet
has
commanded
you
to
do
so
the
last
charge
that
i
will
notice
is
the
most
serious
and
the
most
offensive
we
are
told
that
private
confession
is
lawless
that
the
conscience
soon
becomes
enfeebled
and
chained
and
starved
by
it
and
worse
and
worse
that
sins
are
more
readily
committed
if
followed
by
an
absolution
conveying
other
words
that
the
more
attached
catholics
are
to
the
practice
of
their
holy
religion
the
more
depraved
and
corrupt
they
become
or
if
they
remain
faithful
to
god
this
is
not
by
reason
of
but
in
spite
of
their
religious
exercises
surely
this
was
not
the
sentiment
of
the
late
ives
once
protestant
bishop
of
north
carolina
and
of
many
other
illustrious
converts
who
from
the
day
of
their
conversion
to
the
hour
of
their
death
never
failed
to
receive
consolation
and
strength
from
the
sacred
tribunal
nor
is
it
the
sentiment
of
rev
father
lyman
a
catholic
priest
of
baltimore
and
brother
of
the
assistant
protestant
bishop
of
north
carolina
nor
of
the
present
archbishops
of
baltimore
and
philadelphia
of
the
bishops
of
wilmington
cleveland
columbus
and
ogdensburg
and
a
host
of
others
both
of
the
protestant
clergy
and
laity
who
within
the
last
fifty
years
have
entered
the
catholic
church
if
we
compare
the
protestant
and
catholic
systems
for
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
catholic
system
will
not
suffer
by
the
comparison
according
to
the
protestant
system
repentance
is
necessary
and
sufficient
for
justification
the
catholic
system
also
requires
repentance
on
the
part
of
the
sinner
as
an
indispensable
prerequisite
for
the
forgiveness
of
sin
but
it
requires
much
more
than
this
before
the
penitent
receives
absolution
he
must
carefully
examine
his
conscience
and
confess
his
sins
according
to
their
number
and
kind
he
is
obliged
to
have
a
firm
purpose
of
amendment
to
promise
restitution
if
he
has
defrauded
his
neighbor
to
repair
any
injury
done
his
neighbor
s
character
to
be
reconciled
with
his
enemies
and
to
avoid
the
occasions
of
sin
do
not
these
obligations
afford
a
better
safeguard
against
a
relapse
into
sin
than
a
simple
internal
act
of
contrition
many
most
eminent
protestant
and
even
infidel
writers
who
were
conversant
with
the
practical
workings
of
the
confessional
in
the
countries
in
which
they
lived
bear
testimony
to
the
moral
reformation
produced
by
it
the
famous
german
philosopher
leibnitz
admits
that
it
is
a
great
benefit
conferred
on
men
by
god
that
he
left
in
his
church
the
power
of
forgiving
sins
voltaire
certainly
no
friend
of
christianity
avows
that
there
is
not
perhaps
a
more
useful
institution
than
rousseau
not
less
hostile
to
the
church
exclaims
how
many
restitutions
and
reparations
does
not
confession
cause
among
catholics
the
protestant
authorities
of
nuremberg
in
germany
shortly
after
the
establishment
of
the
reformed
doctrines
in
that
city
were
so
much
alarmed
at
the
laxity
of
morals
which
succeeded
after
the
abolition
of
confession
that
they
petitioned
their
emperor
charles
to
have
it
restored
it
is
a
favorite
custom
for
the
adversaries
of
the
catholic
church
to
refer
to
the
alleged
loose
morals
prevailing
in
france
and
in
other
catholic
countries
as
a
proof
of
the
inferior
standard
of
catholic
morality
this
is
a
safe
and
at
the
same
time
not
the
most
honorable
mode
of
attack
as
the
people
of
those
nations
are
too
far
off
to
defend
themselves
for
my
part
i
have
spent
a
considerable
time
in
various
portions
of
france
and
more
edifying
christians
i
have
never
witnessed
than
those
i
met
in
that
country
for
six
years
i
had
for
my
professors
french
priests
whose
exemplary
lives
were
a
daily
sermon
to
all
around
them
i
submit
that
the
cosmopolitan
city
of
paris
waiving
for
the
present
the
enormities
of
which
it
is
accused
is
not
to
be
adduced
as
a
fair
criterion
of
french
morality
let
us
stay
at
home
and
judge
of
catholic
morals
by
the
examples
furnished
under
our
eyes
the
influence
of
the
confessional
has
been
fairly
tested
in
this
country
since
the
foundation
of
our
republic
are
practical
catholics
enfeebled
in
conscience
is
their
conscience
chained
and
starved
has
the
absolution
they
received
whetted
their
appetites
for
more
sin
are
they
monsters
of
immorality
i
think
that
an
enlightened
protestant
public
will
pronounce
a
contrary
verdict
i
feel
that
i
can
say
with
truth
that
catholics
who
frequent
the
confessional
are
generally
virtuous
in
their
private
lives
just
and
honorable
in
their
dealings
with
others
and
that
they
cultivate
charity
and
toward
their
it
will
not
do
to
reply
that
it
is
the
system
not
the
individual
that
is
attacked
how
can
we
judge
of
a
system
unless
by
its
practical
working
in
the
individual
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
says
our
redeemer
vices
indeed
we
have
to
deplore
among
certain
classes
of
our
people
which
are
often
superinduced
by
their
migratory
habits
and
irregular
mode
of
life
but
they
are
commonly
sins
of
frailty
and
these
are
not
the
persons
that
are
accustomed
to
approach
the
confessional
if
they
did
their
lives
would
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
the
best
of
us
alas
are
not
what
we
ought
to
be
considering
the
graces
we
receive
but
if
you
seek
for
canting
hypocrites
or
colossal
defaulters
or
perpetrators
of
schemes
of
forgery
or
of
systematic
licentiousness
or
of
premeditated
violence
you
will
seek
for
such
in
vain
among
those
who
frequent
the
confessional
there
is
another
objection
which
it
is
difficult
to
kill
it
dies
hard
and
like
banquo
s
ghost
it
will
not
down
if
you
drive
it
from
the
city
it
will
fly
to
the
town
if
you
expel
it
from
the
town
it
will
take
refuge
in
the
village
if
you
eject
it
from
the
village
it
will
hide
itself
like
some
noxious
animal
in
some
desert
place
until
it
makes
its
rounds
again
i
allude
to
the
charge
that
a
price
has
to
be
paid
for
remitting
sins
you
have
only
say
these
slanderers
to
pay
a
certain
toll
at
the
confessional
gate
and
you
can
pass
the
biggest
load
of
it
is
hard
to
treat
these
objections
seriously
i
have
been
hearing
confessions
for
fifty
years
and
of
all
who
have
come
to
me
not
one
has
had
the
sense
of
duty
to
offer
me
any
compensation
for
absolving
them
and
this
is
true
of
every
priest
with
whom
i
have
been
acquainted
the
truth
is
the
priest
who
would
solicit
a
fee
for
absolution
knows
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
simony
and
would
be
liable
to
suspension
but
we
are
told
that
confession
is
an
intolerable
yoke
that
it
makes
its
votaries
the
slaves
of
the
priests
before
answering
this
objection
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
inconsistency
of
our
adversaries
who
blow
hot
and
cold
in
the
same
breath
they
denounce
confession
as
being
too
hard
a
remedy
for
sin
and
condemn
it
at
the
same
time
as
being
a
smooth
road
to
heaven
in
one
sentence
they
style
it
a
bed
of
roses
in
the
next
a
bed
of
thorns
in
a
preceding
objection
it
was
charged
that
the
votaries
of
confession
had
no
moral
constraint
at
all
now
it
is
said
that
their
conscience
is
bound
in
chains
of
slavery
surely
confession
can
not
be
hard
and
easy
at
the
same
time
i
have
already
refuted
i
trust
the
former
charge
i
shall
now
answer
the
second
i
am
not
aware
in
what
sense
our
people
are
less
independent
than
those
of
any
other
class
of
the
community
the
only
restraint
as
far
as
i
know
imposed
on
catholics
by
their
priests
is
the
yoke
of
the
gospel
and
to
this
restraint
no
christian
ought
to
object
in
my
estimation
no
body
of
christians
enjoys
more
apostolic
freedom
than
those
of
the
catholic
communion
because
they
are
guided
in
their
conduct
not
by
the
of
any
minister
but
by
the
unchangeable
teachings
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
but
if
to
love
their
priest
to
reverence
his
sacred
character
to
obey
his
voice
as
the
voice
of
god
if
to
be
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
their
spiritual
father
if
i
say
you
call
this
slavery
then
our
catholic
people
are
slaves
indeed
and
what
is
more
they
are
content
with
their
chains
even
our
manuals
of
devotion
have
not
escaped
the
lash
of
wanton
criticism
they
have
excited
the
pious
horror
of
some
modern
pharisees
because
they
contain
a
table
of
sins
for
the
use
of
those
preparing
for
confession
the
same
flower
that
furnishes
honey
to
the
bee
supplies
poison
to
the
wasp
and
in
like
manner
the
same
book
that
gives
only
the
honey
of
consolation
to
the
devout
reader
has
nothing
but
moral
poison
for
those
that
search
its
pages
for
nothing
else
how
can
anyone
object
to
the
table
of
sins
in
our
and
consistently
advocate
the
circulation
of
the
bible
which
contains
incomparably
plainer
and
more
palpable
allusions
to
gross
crimes
than
are
found
in
our
books
of
devotion
let
us
not
forget
the
adage
soit
qui
mal
y
i
may
be
permitted
in
concluding
this
subject
to
add
the
testimony
of
my
own
experience
on
the
beneficent
influence
of
the
confessional
for
like
my
brethren
in
the
ministry
i
am
in
the
language
of
dryden
one
bred
apart
from
worldly
noise
to
study
souls
their
cures
and
their
since
the
time
of
my
ordination
up
to
the
present
hour
i
have
been
accustomed
to
hear
confessions
almost
every
day
i
have
therefore
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
ascertaining
the
value
of
the
the
impressions
forced
upon
my
mind
far
from
being
peculiar
to
myself
are
shared
by
every
catholic
priest
throughout
the
world
charged
with
the
care
of
souls
the
testimony
of
ten
experienced
confessors
ought
in
my
estimation
to
have
more
weight
in
enabling
men
to
judge
of
the
moral
tendencies
of
the
confessional
than
the
gratuitous
assertions
of
a
thousand
individuals
who
have
no
personal
experience
of
it
but
who
draw
on
their
heated
imaginations
or
on
the
pages
of
sensational
novels
for
the
statements
they
offer
my
experience
is
that
the
confessional
is
the
most
powerful
lever
ever
erected
by
a
merciful
god
for
raising
men
from
the
mire
of
sin
it
has
more
weight
in
withdrawing
people
from
vice
than
even
the
pulpit
in
public
sermons
we
scatter
the
seed
of
the
word
of
god
in
the
confessional
we
reap
the
harvest
in
sermons
to
use
a
military
phrase
the
fire
is
at
random
but
in
confession
it
is
a
dead
shot
the
words
of
the
priest
go
home
to
the
heart
of
the
penitent
in
a
public
discourse
the
priest
addresses
all
in
general
and
his
words
of
admonition
may
be
applicable
to
very
few
of
his
hearers
but
his
words
spoken
in
the
confessional
are
directed
exclusively
to
the
penitent
whose
heart
is
open
to
receive
the
word
of
god
the
confessor
exhorts
the
penitent
according
to
his
spiritual
wants
he
cautions
him
against
the
frequentation
of
dangerous
company
and
other
occasions
of
sin
or
he
recommends
special
practices
of
piety
suited
to
the
penitent
s
wants
hence
missionaries
are
accustomed
to
estimate
the
fruit
of
a
mission
more
by
the
number
of
penitents
who
have
approached
the
sacred
tribunal
than
by
the
number
of
persons
who
have
listened
to
their
sermons
of
all
the
labors
that
our
sacred
ministry
imposes
on
us
there
is
none
more
arduous
or
more
irksome
than
that
of
hearing
confessions
if
i
may
make
a
revelation
of
my
own
life
i
deferred
receiving
holy
orders
for
two
years
from
a
sense
of
the
dread
responsibility
connected
with
the
confessional
it
is
no
trifling
task
to
sit
for
six
or
eight
consecutive
hours
on
a
hot
summer
day
listening
to
stories
of
sin
and
sorrow
and
misery
it
is
only
the
consciousness
of
the
immense
good
he
is
doing
that
sustains
the
confessor
in
the
sacred
tribunal
he
is
one
who
can
have
compassion
on
the
ignorant
and
erring
because
he
himself
is
also
encompassed
with
i
have
seen
the
man
whose
conscience
was
weighed
down
by
the
accumulated
sins
of
twenty
winters
upon
his
face
were
branded
guilt
and
shame
remorse
and
confusion
there
he
stood
by
the
confessional
with
downcast
countenance
ashamed
like
the
publican
to
look
up
to
heaven
he
glided
into
the
little
no
human
ear
will
ever
learn
what
there
transpired
the
revelations
of
the
confessional
are
a
sealed
book
but
during
the
brief
time
spent
in
the
confessional
a
resurrection
occurred
more
miraculous
than
the
raising
of
lazarus
from
the
was
the
resurrection
from
the
grave
of
sin
of
a
soul
that
had
long
lain
during
those
precious
moments
a
ray
from
heaven
dispelled
the
darkness
and
gloom
from
that
s
mind
the
genial
warmth
of
the
holy
spirit
melted
his
frozen
heart
and
the
purifying
influence
of
the
same
spirit
that
came
on
the
apostles
like
a
mighty
wind
from
heaven
scattered
the
poisonous
atmosphere
in
which
he
lived
and
filled
his
soul
with
divine
grace
when
he
came
out
there
was
quickness
in
his
step
joy
on
his
countenance
a
new
light
in
his
eye
had
you
asked
him
why
he
would
have
answered
because
i
was
lost
and
am
found
having
been
dead
i
am
come
to
life
ii
on
the
relative
morality
of
catholic
and
protestant
countries
it
has
been
gravely
asserted
that
the
confession
of
sin
and
the
doctrine
of
absolution
tend
to
the
spread
of
crime
and
immorality
statistics
are
produced
to
show
that
murder
and
illegitimate
births
are
largely
in
excess
in
countries
under
catholic
influence
and
that
this
prevalence
of
wickedness
is
the
of
confession
and
easy
if
our
system
of
absolving
those
only
who
both
repent
and
leads
to
laxity
of
morals
how
much
more
must
the
protestant
system
which
omits
that
which
is
most
humiliating
and
admits
the
sinner
to
reconciliation
on
condition
of
mere
interior
dispositions
as
all
our
catechisms
teach
and
as
every
catholic
knows
there
is
no
pardon
of
sin
without
sorrow
of
heart
and
purpose
of
amendment
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
most
ignorant
catholic
believes
he
can
procure
the
pardon
of
his
sins
by
simply
confessing
them
without
being
truly
sorry
for
them
the
estimate
which
so
many
protestants
set
on
the
virtue
of
even
the
lower
classes
of
roman
catholics
is
clearly
enough
evinced
in
the
preference
which
they
constantly
manifest
in
their
employment
of
who
go
to
confession
i
maintain
therefore
that
confession
far
from
being
an
incentive
to
sin
as
our
adversaries
have
the
hardihood
to
affirm
is
a
most
powerful
check
on
the
depravity
of
men
and
a
most
effectual
preventive
of
their
criminal
excesses
but
is
it
true
that
crimes
especially
murder
and
illegitimacy
are
more
prevalent
in
catholic
than
in
protestant
countries
i
utterly
deny
the
assertion
and
also
appeal
to
statistics
in
support
of
the
denial
whence
do
our
opponents
derive
their
information
forsooth
from
rev
hobart
seymour
s
nights
among
romanists
and
similar
absolutely
unreliable
compilations
the
false
statements
of
which
have
been
again
and
again
refuted
rev
seymour
gives
the
following
list
of
the
number
of
murders
in
england
france
and
ireland
ireland
homicides
to
the
million
of
inhabitants
france
england
the
reader
of
the
above
might
well
draw
back
in
astonishment
and
exclaim
truly
moral
atmosphere
of
england
but
how
do
these
statements
compare
with
the
official
records
which
i
submit
to
the
unprejudiced
reader
recent
returns
from
the
for
france
and
thom
s
official
directory
for
england
and
ireland
are
as
follows
convictions
and
executions
sentences
to
death
france
england
and
wales
ireland
these
figures
which
are
from
authenticated
sources
do
not
bear
out
our
accusers
in
their
assertion
that
murders
are
more
prevalent
in
catholic
than
in
protestant
countries
the
statistics
of
this
crime
are
limited
or
they
are
not
in
very
general
circulation
but
we
have
more
extensive
information
in
reference
to
the
other
great
crime
which
it
is
charged
prevails
to
a
much
more
alarming
extent
in
countries
under
catholic
influence
illegitimacy
here
again
we
shall
meet
statistics
with
to
refute
unjust
declarations
we
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
advocating
the
immaculateness
of
catholic
communities
we
frankly
admit
and
heartily
deplore
the
disorders
which
catholics
commit
but
we
deny
that
they
are
worse
than
their
protestant
neighbors
and
still
more
emphatically
do
we
deny
that
the
church
is
responsible
for
their
disorders
the
journal
of
the
statistical
society
of
london
of
the
years
gives
the
number
of
illegitimate
births
in
england
and
wales
as
in
every
hundred
whilst
in
the
catholic
kingdom
of
sardinia
the
number
is
slightly
over
two
in
the
hundred
and
in
ireland
three
in
every
hundred
if
the
test
of
illegitimacy
is
a
correct
index
of
the
morality
of
a
country
how
refreshing
to
pass
from
protestant
england
across
to
catholic
ireland
or
to
the
continent
and
visit
sardinia
the
moral
atmosphere
of
these
countries
compared
with
england
must
be
as
a
healthful
breeze
to
a
pestilential
marsh
that
we
may
see
at
a
glance
the
real
condition
of
european
countries
in
reference
to
this
species
of
crime
i
will
here
insert
as
correct
a
table
as
can
be
made
from
the
latest
reports

we
have
divided
prussia
into
protestant
and
catholic
because
statistics
are
kept
according
to
the
religious
creed
of
the
people
and
we
discover
that
whilst
among
the
catholic
portion
of
the
empire
there
is
but
a
percentage
of
six
and
a
half
of
illegitimate
births
among
the
protestants
it
runs
up
to
ten
per
cent
and
the
same
remark
is
applicable
to
ireland
the
whose
statements
are
based
on
the
report
of
the
british
publishes
the
following
statistics
the
proportion
of
illegitimate
births
to
the
total
number
of
births
is
in
ireland
per
cent
in
england
the
proportion
is
in
scotland
in
other
words
england
is
nearly
twice
and
scotland
nearly
thrice
worse
than
ireland
something
worse
has
to
be
added
from
which
no
consolation
can
be
derived
the
proportion
of
illegitimacy
is
very
unequally
distributed
over
ireland
and
the
inequality
rather
humbling
to
us
as
protestants
and
still
more
as
presbyterians
and
scotchmen
taking
ireland
according
to
the
registration
divisions
the
proportion
of
illegitimate
births
varies
from
to
the
division
showing
this
lowest
figure
is
the
western
being
substantially
the
province
of
connaught
where
about
of
the
population
are
celtic
and
roman
catholic
the
division
showing
the
highest
proportion
of
illegitimacy
is
the
which
comprises
or
almost
consists
of
the
province
of
ulster
where
the
population
is
almost
equally
divided
between
protestants
and
roman
catholics
and
where
the
great
majority
of
protestants
are
of
scotch
blood
and
of
the
presbyterian
church
the
sum
of
the
whole
matter
is
that
and
ulster
is
fully
three
times
more
immoral
than
wholly
popish
and
wholly
irish
corresponds
with
wonderful
accuracy
to
the
more
general
fact
that
scotland
as
a
whole
is
three
times
more
immoral
than
ireland
as
a
it
is
worthy
too
of
notice
that
in
the
tabular
statement
above
presented
the
percentage
of
illegitimacy
in
holland
and
switzerland
where
there
are
large
catholic
minorities
is
lower
than
in
any
other
protestant
country
we
have
at
hand
evidences
furnished
by
protestant
writers
of
the
hideous
immoralities
of
certain
european
nations
that
are
more
thoroughly
protestantized
than
england
itself
thus
laing
writes
of
the
children
born
in
stockholm
were
legitimate
illegitimate
making
only
a
balance
of
chaste
mothers
out
of
and
the
proportion
of
illegitimate
to
legitimate
children
not
as
one
to
two
and
but
as
one
to
one
and
a
tour
in
sweden
but
we
are
not
disposed
to
parade
these
monstrous
vices
no
matter
by
whom
committed
we
allude
to
them
with
feelings
of
shame
not
of
pleasure
and
give
them
a
passing
notice
merely
in
against
the
gratuitous
assertions
of
our
adversaries
we
certainly
do
not
wish
to
excuse
or
palliate
the
evil
deeds
of
catholics
who
with
all
the
blessed
aids
which
their
religion
affords
ought
to
be
much
better
than
they
are
yet
we
will
add
quoting
the
words
of
the
if
we
are
not
very
much
better
than
our
neighbors
we
are
not
any
worse
and
are
not
to
be
hounded
down
with
the
cry
of
vice
and
immorality
by
a
set
of
pharisees
who
are
constantly
lauding
their
own
superiority
and
thanking
god
they
are
so
much
better
than
we
poor
chapter
xxvii
indulgences
there
are
few
tenets
of
the
catholic
church
so
little
understood
or
so
grossly
misrepresented
by
her
adversaries
as
her
doctrine
regarding
indulgences
one
of
the
reasons
of
the
popular
misapprehension
of
an
indulgence
may
be
ascribed
to
the
change
which
the
meaning
of
that
term
has
gradually
undergone
the
word
indulgence
originally
signified
remission
or
now
it
is
commonly
used
in
the
sense
of
unlawful
gratification
and
of
free
scope
to
the
passions
hence
when
some
ignorant
or
prejudiced
persons
hear
of
the
church
granting
an
indulgence
the
idea
of
license
to
sin
is
at
once
presented
to
their
minds
an
indulgence
is
simply
a
remission
in
whole
or
in
part
through
the
superabundant
merits
of
jesus
christ
and
his
saints
of
the
temporal
punishment
due
to
god
on
account
of
sin
after
the
guilt
and
eternal
punishment
have
been
remitted
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
even
after
our
guilt
is
removed
there
often
remains
some
temporal
punishment
to
be
undergone
either
in
this
life
or
the
next
as
an
expiation
to
divine
sanctity
and
justice
the
holy
scripture
furnishes
us
with
many
examples
of
this
truth
mary
the
sister
of
moses
was
pardoned
the
sin
which
she
had
committed
by
murmuring
against
her
brother
nevertheless
god
inflicted
on
her
the
penalty
of
leprosy
and
of
seven
days
separation
from
the
people
nathan
the
prophet
announced
to
david
that
his
crimes
were
forgiven
but
that
he
should
suffer
many
chastisements
from
the
hand
of
god
that
our
lord
has
given
to
the
church
the
power
of
granting
indulgences
is
clearly
deduced
from
the
sacred
text
to
the
prince
of
the
apostles
he
said
whatsoever
thou
shalt
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
thou
shalt
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
also
in
and
to
all
the
apostles
assembled
together
he
made
the
same
solemn
declaration
by
these
words
our
savior
empowered
his
church
to
deliver
her
children
if
properly
disposed
from
every
obstacle
that
might
retard
them
from
the
kingdom
of
heaven
now
there
are
two
impediments
that
withhold
a
man
from
the
heavenly
and
the
temporal
punishment
incurred
by
it
and
the
church
having
power
to
remit
the
greater
obstacle
which
is
sin
has
power
also
to
remove
the
smaller
obstacle
which
is
the
temporal
punishment
due
on
account
of
it
the
prerogative
of
granting
indulgence
has
been
exercised
by
the
teachers
of
the
church
from
the
beginning
of
her
existence
paul
exercised
it
in
behalf
of
the
incestuous
corinthian
whom
he
had
condemned
to
a
severe
penance
proportioned
to
his
guilt
that
his
spirit
might
be
saved
in
the
day
of
the
and
having
learned
afterwards
of
the
corinthian
s
fervent
contrition
the
apostle
absolves
him
from
the
penance
which
he
had
imposed
to
him
that
is
such
a
one
this
rebuke
is
sufficient
which
is
given
by
many
so
that
contrariwise
you
should
rather
pardon
and
comfort
him
lest
perhaps
such
a
one
be
swallowed
up
with
sorrow
and
to
whom
you
have
pardoned
anything
i
also
for
what
i
have
pardoned
if
i
have
pardoned
anything
for
your
sakes
i
have
done
it
in
the
person
of
here
we
have
all
the
elements
that
constitute
an
indulgence
penance
or
temporal
punishment
proportioned
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence
is
imposed
on
the
transgressor
penitent
is
truly
contrite
for
his
crime
determines
the
apostle
to
remit
the
penalty
apostle
considers
the
relaxation
of
the
penance
ratified
by
jesus
christ
in
whose
name
it
is
imparted
we
find
the
bishops
of
the
church
after
the
apostle
wielding
this
same
power
no
one
disputes
the
right
which
they
claimed
from
the
very
first
ages
of
inflicting
canonical
penances
on
grievous
criminals
who
were
subjected
to
long
fasts
severe
abstinences
and
other
mortifications
for
a
period
extending
from
a
few
days
to
five
or
ten
years
and
even
to
a
lifetime
according
to
the
gravity
of
the
offence
these
penalties
were
in
several
instances
mitigated
or
cancelled
by
the
church
according
to
her
discretion
for
a
society
that
can
inflict
a
punishment
can
also
remit
it
our
lord
gave
his
church
power
not
only
to
bind
but
also
to
loose
this
discretionary
prerogative
was
often
exercised
by
the
church
at
the
intercession
of
those
who
were
condemned
to
martyrdom
when
the
penitents
themselves
gave
strong
marks
of
fervent
sorrow
as
we
learn
from
the
writings
of
tertullian
and
cyprian
the
general
council
of
nice
and
other
synods
authorize
bishops
to
mitigate
or
even
to
remit
altogether
public
penances
whenever
in
their
judgment
the
penitent
manifested
special
marks
of
repentance
now
in
relaxing
the
canonical
penances
or
in
substituting
for
them
a
milder
satisfaction
the
bishops
granted
what
we
call
an
indulgence
this
sentence
of
remission
on
the
part
of
the
bishops
was
valid
not
only
in
the
sight
of
the
church
but
also
in
the
sight
of
god
although
the
church
imposes
canonical
penances
no
longer
god
has
never
ceased
to
inflict
temporal
punishment
for
sin
hence
indulgences
continue
to
be
necessary
now
if
not
as
substitute
for
canonical
penances
at
least
as
a
mild
and
merciful
payment
of
the
temporal
debt
due
to
god
an
indulgence
is
called
plenary
or
partial
according
as
it
remits
the
whole
or
a
part
of
the
temporal
punishment
due
to
sin
an
indulgence
for
instance
of
forty
days
remits
before
god
so
much
of
the
temporal
punishment
as
would
have
been
expiated
in
the
primitive
church
by
a
canonical
penance
of
forty
days
although
the
very
name
of
indulgence
is
now
so
repugnant
to
our
dissenting
brethren
there
was
a
time
when
the
protestant
church
professed
to
grant
them
in
the
canons
of
the
church
of
england
reference
is
made
to
indulgences
and
to
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
money
paid
for
them
from
what
i
have
said
you
may
judge
for
yourself
what
to
think
of
those
who
say
that
an
indulgence
is
the
remission
of
past
sins
or
a
license
to
commit
sin
granted
by
the
pope
as
a
spiritual
compensation
to
the
faithful
for
pecuniary
offerings
made
him
i
need
not
inform
you
that
an
indulgence
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
it
is
not
a
remission
of
sin
since
no
one
can
gain
an
indulgence
until
he
is
already
free
from
sin
it
is
still
less
a
license
to
commit
sin
for
every
catholic
child
knows
that
neither
priest
nor
bishop
nor
pope
nor
even
god
all
reverence
be
it
give
license
to
commit
the
smallest
fault
but
are
not
indulgences
at
variance
with
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
since
they
appear
to
be
a
mild
and
feeble
substitute
for
fasts
abstinences
and
other
penitential
austerities
which
jesus
christ
inculcated
and
practised
and
which
the
primitive
church
enforced
the
church
as
every
one
must
know
who
is
acquainted
with
her
history
never
exempts
her
children
from
the
obligation
of
doing
works
of
penance
no
one
can
deny
that
the
practices
of
mortification
are
more
frequent
among
catholics
than
among
protestants
where
will
you
find
the
evangelical
duty
of
fasting
enforced
if
not
from
the
catholic
pulpit
it
is
well
known
that
among
the
members
of
the
catholic
church
those
who
avail
themselves
of
the
boon
of
indulgences
are
usually
her
most
practical
edifying
and
fervent
children
their
spiritual
growth
far
from
being
retarded
is
quickened
by
the
aid
of
indulgences
which
are
usually
accompanied
by
acts
of
contrition
devotion
and
the
reception
of
the
sacraments
but
do
what
we
will
we
can
not
please
our
opponents
if
we
fast
and
give
alms
if
we
crucify
our
flesh
and
make
pilgrimages
and
perform
other
works
of
penance
we
are
accused
of
clinging
to
the
rags
of
dead
works
instead
of
holding
on
to
jesus
by
faith
if
on
the
other
hand
we
enrich
our
souls
with
the
treasures
of
indulgences
we
are
charged
with
relying
on
the
vicarious
merits
of
others
and
of
lightening
too
much
the
salutary
burden
of
the
cross
but
how
can
protestants
consistently
find
fault
with
the
church
for
the
austerities
of
penance
since
their
own
fundamental
principle
rests
on
alone
without
good
but
have
not
indulgences
been
the
occasion
of
many
abuses
at
various
times
particularly
in
the
sixteenth
century
i
will
not
deny
that
indulgences
have
been
abused
but
are
not
the
most
sacred
things
liable
to
be
perverted
this
is
a
proper
place
to
refer
briefly
to
the
bull
of
pope
leo
proclaiming
the
indulgence
which
afforded
luther
a
pretext
for
his
apostasy
leo
determined
to
bring
to
completion
the
magnificent
church
of
peter
commenced
by
his
predecessor
julius
ii
with
that
view
he
issued
a
bull
promulgating
an
indulgence
to
such
as
would
contribute
some
voluntary
offering
toward
the
erection
of
the
grand
cathedral
those
however
who
contributed
nothing
shared
equally
in
the
treasury
of
the
church
provided
they
complied
with
the
essential
conditions
for
gaining
the
indulgence
the
only
indispensable
conditions
enjoined
by
the
papal
bull
were
sincere
repentance
and
confession
of
sins
d
aubigne
admits
this
truth
though
in
a
faltering
manner
when
he
observes
that
in
the
pope
s
bull
something
was
said
of
the
repentance
of
the
heart
and
the
confession
of
the
the
applicants
for
the
indulgence
knew
well
that
no
matter
how
munificent
were
their
offerings
these
would
avail
them
nothing
without
true
contrition
of
heart
no
traffic
or
sale
of
indulgences
was
consequently
authorized
or
countenanced
by
the
head
of
the
church
since
the
contributions
were
understood
to
be
voluntary
in
order
to
check
any
sordid
love
of
gain
in
those
charged
with
preaching
the
indulgence
the
hand
that
delivered
the
indulgence
as
d
aubigne
testifies
could
not
receive
the
money
that
was
forbidden
under
the
severest
wherein
then
was
the
conduct
of
the
pope
reprehensible
certainly
not
in
soliciting
the
donations
of
the
faithful
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
temple
of
worship
a
temple
which
today
stands
unrivalled
in
majesty
and
beauty
but
thou
of
temples
old
or
altars
new
standest
alone
with
nothing
like
to
thee
worthiest
of
god
the
holy
and
the
true
since
sion
s
desolation
when
that
he
forsook
his
former
city
what
could
be
of
earthly
structures
in
his
honor
piled
of
a
sublimer
aspect
majesty
power
glory
strength
and
beauty
all
are
aisled
in
this
eternal
ark
of
worship
if
moses
was
justified
in
appealing
to
the
hebrew
people
in
the
old
law
for
offerings
to
adorn
the
tabernacle
why
should
not
the
pope
be
equally
justified
in
appealing
for
similar
offerings
to
the
christian
people
among
whom
he
exercises
supreme
authority
as
moses
did
among
the
israelites
nor
did
the
pope
exceed
his
legitimate
powers
in
promising
to
the
pious
donors
spiritual
favors
in
exchange
for
their
donations
for
if
our
sins
can
be
redeemed
by
alms
to
the
poor
as
the
scripture
tells
us
why
not
as
well
by
offerings
in
the
cause
of
religion
when
protestant
ministers
appeal
to
their
congregations
in
behalf
of
themselves
and
their
children
or
in
support
of
a
church
they
do
not
fail
to
hold
out
to
their
hearers
spiritual
blessings
in
reward
for
their
gifts
it
is
not
long
since
a
methodist
parson
of
new
york
addressed
these
sacred
words
to
cornelius
vanderbilt
the
millionaire
who
had
endowed
a
methodist
college
cornelius
thy
prayer
is
heard
and
thy
alms
are
had
in
remembrance
in
the
sight
of
the
minister
is
more
than
even
the
pope
to
whom
were
given
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
the
minister
declares
cornelius
absolved
without
the
preliminary
of
confession
or
contrition
while
even
according
to
d
aubigne
the
inflexible
pope
insisted
on
the

extreme
unction
extreme
unction
is
a
sacrament
in
which
the
sick
by
the
anointing
with
holy
oil
and
the
prayers
of
the
priests
receive
spiritual
succor
and
even
corporal
strength
when
such
is
conducive
to
their
salvation
this
unction
is
called
because
it
is
usually
the
last
of
the
holy
unctions
administered
by
the
church
the
apostle
james
clearly
refers
to
this
sacrament
and
points
out
its
efficacy
in
the
following
words
is
any
man
sick
among
you
let
him
bring
in
the
priests
of
the
church
and
let
them
pray
over
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
the
prayer
of
faith
shall
save
the
sick
man
and
the
lord
shall
raise
him
up
and
if
he
be
in
sins
they
shall
be
forgiven
several
of
the
ancient
fathers
allude
to
this
sacrament
origen
third
century
writes
there
is
also
a
remission
of
sins
through
penitence
when
the
sinner
is
not
ashamed
to
declare
his
sin
to
the
priest
of
the
lord
and
to
seek
a
remedy
wherein
that
also
is
fulfilled
which
the
apostle
james
saith
if
any
be
sick
among
you
let
him
call
in
the
priests
of
the
church
and
let
them
impose
hands
on
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
chrysostom
fourth
century
says
not
only
when
they
the
priests
regenerate
us
but
they
have
also
power
to
forgive
sins
committed
afterward
for
he
says
is
any
man
sick
among
you
let
him
call
in
the
priests
of
the
church
and
let
them
pray
over
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
pope
innocent
i
fifth
century
in
a
letter
to
a
bishop
named
decentius
after
quoting
the
words
of
james
proceeds
these
words
there
is
no
doubt
ought
to
be
understood
of
the
faithful
who
are
sick
who
can
be
anointed
with
the
holy
oil
which
having
been
prepared
by
a
bishop
may
be
used
not
only
for
priests
but
for
all
the
sacramentary
or
ancient
roman
ritual
revised
by
pope
gregory
in
the
sixth
century
prescribes
the
blessing
of
oil
by
the
bishop
and
the
prayers
to
be
recited
in
the
anointing
of
the
sick
the
venerable
bede
of
england
who
lived
in
the
eighth
century
referring
to
the
words
of
james
writes
the
custom
of
the
church
requires
that
the
sick
be
anointed
by
the
priests
with
consecrated
oil
and
be
sanctified
by
the
prayer
which
accompanies
the
greek
church
which
separated
from
the
roman
catholic
church
in
the
ninth
century
says
in
its
profession
of
faith
the
seventh
sacrament
is
extreme
unction
prescribed
by
christ
for
after
he
had
begun
to
send
his
disciples
two
and
two
mark
vi
they
anointed
and
healed
many
which
unction
the
church
has
since
maintained
by
pious
usage
as
we
learn
from
the
epistle
of
james
is
any
man
sick
among
you
the
fruits
proper
to
this
sacrament
as
james
declares
are
the
remission
of
sins
health
of
soul
fine
of
body
but
though
it
does
not
always
produce
this
last
result
it
always
at
least
restores
the
soul
to
a
better
state
by
the
forgiveness
of
this
is
precisely
the
catholic
teaching
on
this
subject
all
the
other
oriental
churches
some
of
which
separated
from
rome
in
the
fifth
century
likewise
enumerate
extreme
unction
among
their
sacraments
such
identity
of
doctrine
proclaimed
during
so
many
ages
by
churches
so
wide
apart
can
have
no
other
than
an
apostolic
origin
the
eminent
protestant
leibnitz
makes
this
candid
admission
there
is
no
room
for
much
discussion
regarding
the
unction
of
the
sick
it
is
supported
by
the
words
of
scripture
the
interpretation
of
the
church
in
which
pious
and
catholic
men
safely
confide
nor
do
i
see
what
any
one
can
find
reprehensible
in
that
practice
which
the
church
protestants
though
professing
to
be
guided
by
the
holy
scripture
entirely
disregard
the
admonition
of
james
luther
acted
with
more
consistency
finding
that
the
injunction
of
the
apostle
was
too
plain
to
be
explained
away
by
subtlety
of
words
he
boldly
rejected
the
entire
epistle
which
he
contemptuously
styled
a
letter
of
it
is
sad
to
think
that
our
separated
brethren
discard
this
consoling
instrument
of
grace
though
pressed
upon
them
by
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
for
surely
a
spiritual
medicine
which
diminishes
the
terrors
of
death
comforts
the
dying
christian
fortifies
the
soul
in
its
final
struggle
and
purifies
it
for
its
passage
from
time
to
eternity
should
be
gratefully
and
eagerly
made
use
of
especially
when
prescribed
by
an
inspired
physician
chapter
xxix
the
priesthood
the
apostles
were
clothed
with
the
powers
of
jesus
christ
the
priest
as
the
successor
of
the
apostles
is
clothed
with
their
power
this
fact
reveals
to
us
the
eminent
dignity
of
the
priestly
character
the
exalted
dignity
of
the
priest
is
derived
not
from
the
personal
merits
for
which
he
may
be
conspicuous
but
from
the
sublime
functions
which
he
is
charged
to
perform
to
the
carnal
eye
the
priest
looks
like
other
men
but
to
the
eye
of
faith
he
is
exalted
above
the
angels
because
he
exercises
powers
not
given
even
to
angels
the
priest
is
the
of
appointed
to
vindicate
his
honor
and
to
proclaim
his
glory
we
are
ambassadors
for
christ
says
the
apostle
god
as
it
were
exhorting
by
if
it
is
esteemed
a
great
privilege
for
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
represent
our
country
in
any
of
the
courts
of
europe
how
much
greater
is
the
prerogative
to
represent
the
court
of
heaven
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
as
the
father
hath
sent
me
says
our
lord
to
his
apostles
i
also
send
going
therefore
teach
ye
all
nations
teaching
them
to
observe
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
commanded
you
and
behold
i
am
with
you
all
days
even
to
the
consummation
of
the
the
jurisdiction
of
earthly
representatives
is
limited
but
the
authority
of
the
ministers
of
god
extends
over
the
whole
earth
go
ye
into
the
whole
world
and
preach
the
gospel
says
christ
to
every
not
only
does
jesus
empower
his
ministers
to
preach
in
his
name
but
he
commands
their
hearers
to
listen
and
obey
whosoever
will
not
receive
you
nor
hear
your
words
going
forth
from
that
house
or
city
shake
off
the
dust
from
your
feet
amen
i
say
to
you
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrha
in
the
day
of
judgment
than
for
that
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
me
despiseth
him
that
sent
god
requires
not
only
that
his
gospel
should
be
heard
with
reverence
but
that
the
persons
of
his
apostles
should
be
honored
as
no
greater
insult
can
be
offered
to
a
nation
than
to
insult
its
representative
at
a
foreign
court
so
no
greater
injury
can
be
offered
to
our
lord
than
to
do
violence
to
his
representatives
the
priests
of
his
church
touch
not
my
anointed
and
do
no
evil
to
my
god
avenged
the
crime
of
two
and
forty
boys
who
mocked
the
prophet
eliseus
by
sending
wild
beasts
to
tear
them
in
pieces
the
frightful
death
of
maria
monk
the
caluminator
of
consecrated
priests
and
virgins
who
ended
her
life
a
drunken
maniac
on
blackwell
s
island
proves
that
our
religious
institutions
are
not
to
be
mocked
with
impunity
when
an
ambassador
is
accredited
from
this
country
to
a
foreign
court
he
is
honored
with
the
confidence
of
the
president
from
whom
he
receives
private
instructions
so
does
jesus
honor
his
ambassadors
with
his
friendship
and
communicate
to
them
the
secrets
of
heaven
i
will
not
now
call
you
servants
for
the
servant
knoweth
not
what
his
lord
doeth
but
i
have
called
you
friends
because
all
things
whatsoever
i
have
heard
of
my
father
i
have
made
known
to
what
a
privilege
to
be
the
herald
of
god
s
law
to
the
nations
of
the
earth
how
beautiful
on
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
and
that
preacheth
peace
of
him
that
showeth
forth
good
that
preacheth
salvation
that
saith
to
sion
thy
god
shall
how
cherished
a
favor
to
be
the
bearer
of
the
olive
branch
of
peace
to
a
world
deluged
by
sin
to
be
appointed
by
heaven
to
proclaim
a
gospel
which
brings
glory
to
god
and
peace
to
men
that
gospel
which
strengthens
the
weak
converts
the
sinner
reconciles
enemies
consoles
the
afflicted
heart
and
holds
out
to
all
the
hope
of
eternal
salvation
i
have
often
reflected
on
a
remark
made
to
me
by
senator
bayard
of
delaware
you
of
the
clergy
he
said
have
a
great
advantage
as
public
speakers
over
us
political
men
you
enjoy
the
confidence
of
your
hearers
you
can
speak
as
long
as
you
please
you
can
admonish
and
rebuke
as
much
as
you
please
without
any
fear
of
contradiction
while
we
are
constantly
liable
to
o
what
a
tremendous
power
is
wielded
by
the
catholic
preacher
hundreds
of
souls
are
hanging
on
his
words
hundreds
are
sustained
by
him
in
spiritual
life
and
leave
the
church
depending
on
him
whether
they
go
forth
fortified
with
the
bread
of
life
or
famished
and
disappointed
i
can
say
of
every
priest
what
simeon
said
of
our
lord
this
man
is
set
for
the
fall
and
the
resurrection
of
many
in
not
only
are
priests
the
ambassadors
of
god
but
they
are
also
the
of
his
and
the
almoners
of
his
mercy
let
a
man
so
regard
us
says
the
apostle
as
ministers
of
christ
and
dispensers
of
the
mysteries
of
how
can
he
be
called
a
dispenser
of
god
s
mysteries
whose
labors
are
confined
to
preaching
but
he
is
truly
a
dispenser
of
divine
mysteries
who
distributes
to
the
faithful
the
sacraments
the
mysterious
symbols
and
efficient
causes
of
grace
as
john
chrysostom
observes
it
was
not
to
angels
or
archangels
but
to
the
priests
of
the
new
law
that
christ
said
whatsoever
you
shall
bind
on
earth
shall
be
bound
also
in
heaven
and
whatsoever
you
shall
loose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
also
in
to
them
alone
he
gave
the
power
to
forgive
sins
saying
whose
sins
you
shall
forgive
they
are
to
them
alone
he
gave
the
power
of
consecrating
his
body
and
blood
and
dispensing
the
same
to
the
faithful
he
has
empowered
the
priests
of
the
new
law
to
impart
the
grace
of
regeneration
in
baptism
he
has
assigned
to
them
the
solemn
duty
of
preparing
the
dying
christian
for
his
final
journey
to
eternity
is
any
man
sick
among
you
let
him
bring
in
the
priests
of
the
church
and
let
them
pray
over
him
anointing
him
with
oil
in
the
name
of
the
as
far
as
heaven
is
above
earth
as
eternity
is
above
time
and
the
soul
is
above
the
body
so
far
are
the
prerogatives
vested
in
god
s
ministers
higher
than
those
of
any
earthly
potentate
an
earthly
prince
can
cast
into
prison
or
release
therefrom
but
his
power
is
over
the
body
he
can
not
penetrate
into
the
sanctuary
of
the
soul
whereas
the
minister
of
god
can
release
the
soul
from
the
prison
of
sin
and
restore
it
to
the
liberty
of
a
child
of
god
to
sum
up
in
a
few
brief
sentences
the
titles
of
a
catholic
priest
he
is
a
reigning
not
over
unwilling
subjects
but
over
the
hearts
and
affections
of
his
people
his
spiritual
children
pay
him
not
only
the
tribute
of
their
money
but
also
the
tribute
of
their
love
which
royalty
can
neither
purchase
nor
exact
he
is
a
because
he
leads
his
flock
into
the
delicious
pastures
of
the
sacraments
and
shelters
them
from
the
wolves
that
lie
in
wait
for
their
souls
he
is
a
because
he
breaks
the
bread
of
life
to
his
spiritual
children
whom
he
has
begotten
in
christ
jesus
through
the
gospel
he
is
a
whose
office
it
is
to
pass
sentence
of
pardon
on
criminals
he
is
a
because
he
heals
their
souls
from
the
loathsome
distempers
of
sin
john
in
his
apocalypse
represents
the
church
under
the
figure
of
a
city
i
saw
the
holy
city
the
new
jerusalem
coming
down
from
heaven
from
god
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
our
savior
is
the
architect
and
founder
of
this
celestial
city
the
apostles
are
its
foundation
the
faithful
are
the
living
stones
of
the
edifice
the
anointed
ministers
of
the
lord
are
the
workmen
chosen
to
adjust
and
polish
these
stones
that
they
may
reflect
the
beauty
and
glory
of
the
sun
of
justice
that
perpetually
illumines
this
city
the
priests
are
engaged
in
adorning
the
interior
of
the
heavenly
jerusalem
by
enriching
with
virtue
the
precious
souls
entrusted
to
their
charge
god
gave
some
indeed
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
others
evangelists
and
others
pastors
and
doctors
for
the
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
building
up
of
the
body
of
christ
which
is
his
church
what
an
honor
is
this
to
the
priest
of
the
new
law
surely
god
hath
not
done
alike
to
every
nation
and
his
judgments
he
hath
not
made
manifest
to
with
how
much
more
force
may
we
apply
to
the
successors
of
the
apostles
the
words
which
god
spoke
to
the
priests
of
the
old
law
hear
ye
sons
of
levi
is
it
a
small
thing
unto
you
that
the
god
of
israel
hath
separated
you
from
all
the
people
and
joined
you
to
himself
that
ye
should
serve
him
in
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
and
should
stand
before
the
congregation
of
the
people
and
minister
unto
him
our
savior
affectionately
puts
this
question
three
times
to
peter
simon
lovest
thou
me
and
three
times
peter
answers
him
lord
thou
knowest
that
i
love
what
proof
of
love
then
does
jesus
exact
of
peter
does
he
say
if
thou
lovest
me
chastise
thy
body
by
fasting
and
stripes
prophesy
work
miracles
lay
down
thy
life
for
me
no
but
feed
my
lambs
feed
my
this
was
to
be
the
closest
bond
of
peter
s
devotion
to
his
master
and
of
the
master
s
affection
for
his
disciple
and
our
lord
declares
that
the
reward
of
his
disciples
would
be
commensurate
with
the
dignity
of
their
ministry
behold
says
peter
we
have
left
all
things
and
have
followed
thee
what
therefore
shall
we
have
and
jesus
said
to
them
amen
i
say
to
you
that
you
who
have
followed
me
in
the
regeneration
when
the
son
of
man
shall
sit
on
the
seat
of
his
majesty
you
shall
also
sit
on
twelve
seats
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
and
immediately
after
he
adds
that
the
worthy
successors
of
the
apostles
shall
share
in
their
felicity
and
every
one
that
hath
left
house
or
brethren
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
wife
or
children
or
lands
for
my
name
s
sake
shall
receive
a
hundredfold
and
shall
possess
life
i
know
that
there
are
many
in
our
days
who
deny
that
priests
possess
any
spiritual
if
god
could
not
communicate
such
power
to
men
i
understand
why
atheists
and
rationalists
who
reject
all
revelation
should
deny
all
supernatural
authority
to
the
ministers
of
god
but
that
professing
christians
who
accept
the
testimony
of
scripture
should
share
in
this
unbelief
passes
my
comprehension
has
not
the
almighty
in
numberless
instances
recorded
in
holy
writ
made
man
the
instrument
of
his
power
did
not
moses
convert
the
rivers
of
egypt
into
blood
did
he
not
cause
water
to
issue
from
the
barren
rock
did
not
the
prophets
predict
future
events
did
not
the
sun
stand
still
in
the
heavens
at
the
command
of
josue
did
not
eliseus
the
prophet
raise
the
dead
to
life
why
do
we
believe
all
these
prodigies
because
the
scriptures
record
them
does
not
the
same
word
of
god
declare
that
the
apostles
received
power
to
confer
the
holy
ghost
by
the
imposition
of
hands
to
forgive
sins
to
consecrate
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
etc
is
not
the
new
testament
as
worthy
of
belief
as
the
old
has
not
jesus
christ
solemnly
promised
to
be
always
with
the
ministers
of
his
church
even
to
the
consummation
of
the
world
strengthening
them
to
repeat
those
miracles
of
mercy
that
were
wrought
by
his
first
disciples
can
the
god
of
truth
be
unfaithful
to
his
promises
is
he
not
as
strong
and
merciful
now
as
he
was
in
days
of
the
prophets
and
apostles
and
are
not
we
as
much
in
need
of
the
holy
ghost
as
the
primitive
christians
were
if
god
could
make
feeble
men
the
ministers
of
his
mercy
then
why
not
now
but
should
a
priest
consider
himself
greater
than
other
men
because
he
exercises
such
authority
far
from
it
he
ought
to
humble
himself
beneath
others
when
he
reflects
to
what
weak
hands
god
assigns
power
so
tremendous
he
should
remember
what
our
savior
said
to
the
disciples
who
returning
with
joy
from
their
first
mission
cried
out
to
him
lord
even
the
devils
are
subject
to
us
in
thy
but
jesus
checked
their
saying
i
saw
satan
like
lightning
fall
from
heaven
behold
i
have
given
you
power
but
rejoice
not
in
this
that
spirits
are
subject
to
you
but
rejoice
in
this
that
your
names
are
written
in
the
priest
does
not
forget
that
the
most
severe
judgment
shall
be
for
them
that
bear
rule
and
that
judgment
should
begin
at
the
house
of
the
words
of
the
apostle
are
present
to
his
mind
what
hast
thou
that
thou
hast
not
received
and
if
thou
hast
received
why
dost
thou
glory
as
if
thou
hadst
not
received
it
as
well
might
the
vessel
that
is
filled
with
precious
liquor
boast
of
being
superior
to
the
vessel
that
is
filled
with
water
the
priest
knows
full
well
that
the
powers
he
has
received
from
god
are
given
to
him
not
to
feed
his
own
vanity
but
to
enrich
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
and
that
though
instrumental
in
pointing
out
to
others
the
way
to
heaven
he
himself
unless
adorned
with
personal
virtues
will
become
a
reprobate
like
those
unhappy
priests
of
jerusalem
who
directed
the
magi
to
jesus
in
bethlehem
but
did
not
go
thither
themselves
i
have
planted
says
the
apostle
apollo
watered
but
god
gave
the
increase
therefore
neither
he
that
planteth
is
anything
nor
he
that
watereth
but
god
that
giveth
the
we
perform
the
outward
ceremony
god
alone
supplies
the
grace
the
obligations
of
the
minister
of
god
are
therefore
commensurate
with
his
exalted
dignity
the
priest
is
required
to
be
a
man
of
profound
learning
and
of
solid
piety
the
lips
of
the
priest
shall
keep
knowledge
and
they
the
people
shall
seek
the
law
at
his
the
lord
denounces
the
priests
of
the
old
law
because
they
neglected
to
study
the
sacred
sciences
because
thou
hast
rejected
knowledge
i
will
reject
thee
that
thou
shalt
not
do
the
office
of
priesthood
for
me
and
thou
hast
forgotten
the
law
of
thy
god
i
will
also
forget
thy
to
you
says
our
lord
to
his
apostles
it
is
given
to
know
the
mystery
of
the
kingdom
of
god
to
the
rest
in
the
priests
of
the
new
law
like
the
apostles
are
the
custodians
of
the
mysteries
of
religion
now
we
know
that
the
knowledge
of
god
s
kingdom
is
not
imparted
to
us
by
inspiration
or
revelation
christ
does
not
personally
teach
us
as
he
taught
his
apostles
it
is
by
hard
study
that
the
knowledge
of
his
law
is
acquired
by
us
he
does
not
lift
us
up
on
angels
wings
to
the
spiritual
parnassus
it
is
only
by
the
royal
road
of
earnest
labor
that
we
can
attain
those
heights
which
will
enable
us
to
contemplate
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
describe
it
to
others
as
physician
of
the
soul
he
must
be
conversant
with
its
various
distempers
and
must
know
what
remedy
is
to
be
applied
in
each
particular
case
if
society
justly
holds
the
unskilful
physician
responsible
for
the
fatal
consequences
of
his
malpractice
surely
god
will
call
to
a
strict
account
the
spiritual
physician
who
through
criminal
ignorance
prescribes
injudicious
remedies
to
the
souls
of
the
patients
committed
to
his
charge
as
judge
of
souls
he
must
know
when
to
bind
and
when
to
loose
when
to
defer
and
when
to
pronounce
sentence
of
absolution
if
nothing
is
so
disastrous
to
the
republic
as
an
incompetent
judge
whose
decisions
though
involving
life
and
death
are
rendered
at
and
not
in
accordance
with
the
merits
of
the
case
so
nothing
is
more
detrimental
to
the
christian
commonwealth
than
an
ignorant
priesthood
whose
decisions
injuriously
affect
the
salvation
of
souls
the
advocate
in
our
courts
of
justice
feels
bound
in
conscience
and
in
honor
to
study
the
case
of
his
client
with
the
utmost
diligence
and
to
defend
him
before
the
jury
with
all
the
eloquence
he
can
master
and
yet
the
suit
may
not
involve
more
than
a
brief
imprisonment
or
even
a
limited
fine
but
the
priest
like
moses
stands
before
god
to
intercede
for
his
people
and
before
the
people
to
advocate
the
cause
of
god
he
not
only
ascends
daily
the
altar
to
plead
for
the
people
and
to
cry
out
with
the
prophet
spare
o
lord
spare
thy
people
and
give
not
thy
inheritance
to
reproach
but
every
sunday
he
mounts
the
pulpit
to
vindicate
the
claims
which
god
has
on
his
subjects
certainly
if
an
attorney
is
bound
to
study
his
client
s
cause
before
he
defends
it
no
matter
how
trifling
the
issue
how
much
more
imperative
is
the
obligation
of
the
priest
to
study
well
his
case
when
he
reflects
that
an
immortal
soul
is
on
trial
and
before
men
who
are
often
the
worst
enemies
of
their
own
soul
he
has
to
convince
the
people
that
the
narrow
road
which
their
inclinations
abhor
is
to
be
followed
and
that
the
broad
road
which
their
and
their
passions
tend
to
pursue
is
to
be
abandoned
conviction
in
this
case
requires
rare
tact
as
well
as
eloquence
and
learning
but
the
minister
of
religion
has
to
defend
the
soul
not
only
against
the
corruptions
of
the
heart
but
also
against
those
doctrinal
errors
that
are
daily
springing
up
in
every
direction
and
which
are
plausibly
preached
by
false
teachers
who
bring
to
their
support
the
most
specious
arguments
couched
in
the
most
attractive
language
to
refute
these
errors
often
requires
the
most
consummate
skill
and
a
profound
knowledge
of
history
and
the
holy
scripture
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
the
church
insists
that
her
clergy
be
educated
men
hence
our
ecclesiastical
students
are
usually
obliged
to
devote
from
ten
to
fourteen
years
to
the
diligent
study
of
the
modern
and
ancient
languages
of
history
and
philosophy
of
the
great
science
of
theology
and
holy
scripture
before
they
are
elevated
to
the
sacred
ministry
it
is
true
indeed
that
owing
to
the
demand
for
clergy
in
the
united
states
our
bishops
have
hitherto
been
sometimes
compelled
to
abridge
the
course
of
studies
of
the
candidates
for
the
ministry
but
now
that
the
church
is
more
thoroughly
organized
and
that
seminaries
are
multiplied
among
us
they
are
happily
enabled
to
extend
to
their
young
levites
the
advantages
of
a
full
term
of
literary
and
theological
training
if
the
priest
should
be
eminent
for
his
learning
he
should
be
still
more
conspicuous
for
his
virtues
for
he
is
expected
to
preach
more
by
example
than
by
precept
if
in
the
old
law
god
charged
his
priests
with
the
admonition
be
sanctified
ye
that
carry
the
vessels
of
the
lord
how
much
more
strictly
is
holiness
of
life
enjoined
on
the
priests
of
the
new
dispensation
who
not
only
touch
the
sacred
vessels
but
drink
from
them
the
precious
blood
of
the
lord
purer
says
chrysostom
than
any
solar
ray
should
that
hand
be
which
divides
that
flesh
that
mouth
which
is
filled
with
spiritual
fire
that
tongue
which
is
purpled
with
that
most
awful
in
order
to
foster
in
us
the
spirit
of
personal
piety
we
are
constantly
admonished
by
the
church
to
be
men
of
prayer
the
priest
should
be
like
those
angels
whom
jacob
saw
in
a
vision
ascending
to
heaven
and
descending
therefrom
on
the
mystical
ladder
he
is
expected
to
ascend
by
prayer
and
to
descend
by
preaching
he
ascends
to
heaven
to
receive
light
from
god
he
descends
to
communicate
that
light
to
his
hearers
he
ascends
to
draw
at
the
fountain
of
divine
grace
he
descends
to
diffuse
those
living
waters
among
the
faithful
that
their
hearts
may
be
refreshed
he
ascends
to
light
his
torch
at
the
furnace
of
divine
love
he
descends
to
communicate
the
flame
to
the
souls
of
his
people
the
church
indeed
considers
prayer
so
indispensable
to
her
clergy
that
besides
the
voluntary
exercises
of
piety
which
their
private
devotion
may
suggest
she
requires
them
to
devote
at
least
an
hour
each
day
to
the
recitation
of
the
divine
office
which
chiefly
consists
of
the
psalms
and
other
portions
of
holy
scripture
the
homilies
of
the
early
fathers
and
prayers
of
marvelous
force
and
unction
chapter
xxx
celibacy
of
the
clergy
the
church
requires
her
priests
to
be
pure
in
body
as
well
as
in
soul
and
to
present
their
bodies
a
living
victim
holy
unto
our
savior
and
his
apostles
though
recognizing
matrimony
as
a
holy
state
have
proclaimed
the
superior
merits
of
voluntary
continency
particularly
for
those
who
consecrate
their
lives
to
the
sacred
ministry
there
are
eunuchs
who
have
made
themselves
such
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
s
sake
he
who
can
take
it
let
him
take
our
lord
evidently
recommends
here
the
state
of
celibacy
to
such
as
feel
themselves
called
to
embrace
it
in
order
to
attain
greater
perfection
paul
gives
the
reason
why
our
savior
declares
continency
to
be
a
more
suitable
state
for
his
ministers
than
that
of
matrimony
he
who
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
of
the
he
may
please
god
but
he
who
is
married
is
solicitous
about
the
things
of
the
he
may
please
his
he
is
jesus
christ
manifestly
showed
his
predilection
for
virginity
not
only
by
always
remaining
a
virgin
but
by
selecting
a
and
a
in
the
person
of
john
the
baptist
and
by
exhibiting
a
special
effection
for
john
the
evangelist
because
as
augustine
testifies
that
apostle
was
chosen
a
virgin
and
such
he
always
remained
not
only
did
our
lord
thus
manifest
while
on
earth
a
marked
predilection
for
virgins
but
he
exhibits
the
same
preference
for
them
in
heaven
for
the
hundred
and
thousand
who
are
chosen
to
sing
the
new
canticle
and
who
follow
the
lamb
whithersoever
he
goeth
are
all
virgins
as
john
testifies
apoc
xiv
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
assures
us
that
he
led
a
single
life
and
he
commends
that
state
to
others
i
say
to
the
unmarried
and
to
the
widows
it
is
good
for
them
if
they
so
continue
even
as
there
is
no
evidence
from
scripture
that
any
of
the
apostles
were
married
except
peter
jerome
says
that
if
any
were
married
they
certainly
separated
from
their
wives
after
they
were
called
to
the
apostolate
even
peter
after
his
vocation
did
not
continue
with
his
wife
as
may
be
inferred
from
his
own
words
behold
we
have
left
all
things
and
followed
among
all
things
must
be
reckoned
the
fellowship
of
his
wife
for
he
could
hardly
say
with
truth
that
he
had
left
all
things
if
he
had
not
left
his
wife
our
savior
immediately
after
enumerates
the
wife
among
those
cherished
objects
the
renunciation
of
which
for
his
sake
will
have
its
reward
paul
declares
that
a
bishop
must
be
sober
just
holy
and
writing
to
timothy
whom
he
had
consecrated
bishop
he
says
be
thou
an
example
to
the
faithful
in
charity
in
faith
in
in
another
place
he
enumerates
chastity
among
the
virtues
that
should
adorn
the
christian
minister
in
all
things
let
us
exhibit
ourselves
as
the
ministers
of
god
in
much
patience
in
although
celibacy
is
not
expressly
enforced
by
our
savior
it
is
however
commended
so
strongly
by
himself
and
his
apostles
both
by
word
and
example
that
the
church
felt
it
her
duty
to
lay
it
down
as
a
law
the
discipline
of
the
church
has
been
exerted
from
the
beginning
in
prohibiting
priests
to
marry
their
ordination
jerome
observes
that
bishops
priests
and
deacons
are
chosen
from
virgins
or
widowers
or
at
least
they
remain
perpetually
chaste
after
being
elevated
to
the
to
jovinian
he
writes
you
certainly
admit
that
he
can
not
remain
a
bishop
who
begets
children
in
the
episcopacy
for
if
convicted
he
will
not
be
esteemed
as
a
husband
but
condemned
as
an
again
he
says
what
will
the
churches
of
the
east
of
egypt
and
of
the
apostolic
see
do
which
adopt
their
clergy
from
among
virgins
or
if
they
have
wives
they
cease
to
live
as
married
epiphanius
declares
that
he
who
leads
a
married
life
is
not
admitted
by
the
church
to
the
order
of
deacon
priest
bishop
or
in
the
primitive
days
of
the
church
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
vocations
among
the
unmarried
married
men
were
admitted
to
sacred
orders
but
they
were
enjoined
as
we
learn
from
various
canons
to
live
separated
from
their
wives
after
their
ordination
this
discipline
it
is
true
was
relaxed
to
some
extent
in
favor
of
a
portion
of
the
clergy
of
the
oriental
church
who
were
permitted
to
live
with
their
wives
if
they
happened
to
espouse
them
before
ordination
but
like
the
priests
of
the
western
church
the
eastern
clergy
were
forbidden
to
contract
marriage
after
their
ordination
it
is
important
also
to
observe
that
the
unmarried
clergy
of
the
east
are
held
in
much
higher
esteem
by
the
people
than
the
married
priests
it
can
not
indeed
be
denied
that
at
certain
epochs
of
the
church
s
history
especially
in
periods
of
disordered
society
there
were
too
many
instances
of
the
violation
of
clerical
celibacy
but
the
repeated
violations
of
a
law
are
no
evidence
of
its
whenever
the
voice
of
the
church
could
be
heard
it
always
spoke
in
vindication
of
the
law
of
priestly
chastity
let
me
now
call
your
attention
to
the
propriety
and
advantages
of
clerical
celibacy
priest
is
the
representative
of
jesus
christ
he
continues
the
work
begun
by
his
divine
master
it
is
his
duty
to
preach
the
word
to
administer
the
sacraments
and
above
all
to
consecrate
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
and
to
distribute
the
same
to
the
faithful
is
it
not
becoming
that
a
chaste
lord
should
be
served
by
chaste
ministers
if
the
jewish
priests
while
engaged
in
their
turn
in
offering
the
sacrifice
of
animals
in
the
temple
were
obliged
to
keep
apart
from
their
wives
should
not
the
priests
of
the
new
law
who
offer
daily
the
sacrifice
of
the
immaculate
lamb
practise
continual
chastity
if
david
and
his
friends
were
not
permitted
to
eat
the
bread
of
proposition
till
he
had
avowed
that
for
the
three
preceding

eminent
protestant
divine
in
his
work
entitled

and
makes
the
following
observation
the
reason
for
single
life
for
the
clergy
is
firmly
grounded
by
the
fathers
and
canons
of
the
church
upon
the
precept
of
paul
forbidding
man
and
wife
to
depart
unless
for
a
time
to
attend
unto
prayer
cor
vii
for
priests
and
deacons
being
continually
to
attend
upon
occasions
of
celebrating
the
eucharist
which
ought
continually
to
be
frequented
if
others
be
to
abstain
from
the
use
of
marriage
for
a
time

they
frequently
discuss
the
secret
cause
of
the
marvelous
success
which
marks
the
growth
of
the
catholic
church
everywhere
in

of
the
most
formidable
opposition
some
ascribe
this
progress
to
her
thorough
organization
others
to
the
wisdom
of
her
chief
pastors
without
undervaluing
these
and
other
auxiliaries
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
under
god
the
church
has
no
tower
of
strength
more
potent
than
the
celibacy
of
her
clergy
the
unmarried
priest
as
paul
observes
cor
vii
is
free
to
give
his
whole
time
undivided
to
the
lord
and
can
devote
his
attention
not
to
one
or
two
children
but
to
the
entire
flock
whom
he
has
begotten
in
christ
jesus
through
the
gospel
while
the
married
minister
is
divided
between
the
cares
of
his
family
and
his
duties
to
the
congregation
a
single
life

bacon

churchmen
for
charity
will
hardly
water
the
ground
where
it
must
first
fill
a
world

hitherto
been
converted
by
unmarried
clergymen
and
only
by
them
will
it
continue
to
be
converted
francis
xavier
and
francis
de

could
not
have
planted
the
faith
in
so
many
thousands
of
souls
if
they
were
accompanied
on
their
journeys
by
their
wives
and
children
of
all
the
gems
that
adorn
the
priestly
diadem
none
is
so
precious
and
indispensable
in

eyes
of

the
peerless
jewel

without

and

with

humblest
missioner

the
hearts
of
multitudes
everybody
is
aware
of
the
numerous
conversions
to
christianity
effected
by
francis
xavier
in
japan
in
the
sixteenth
century
after
the
lapse
of
many
years
from
the
death
of
francis
when
a
french
squadron
was
permitted
to
enter
the
japanese
ports
a
native
christian
named
peter
having
learned
that
french
priests
were
on
board
put
their
faith
to
the
test
by
proposing
to
them
these
three
questions
are
you
followers
of
the
great
father
in
rome
do
you
honor
mary
the
blessed
virgin
have
you
wives
the
french
priests
having
satisfied
their
interrogator
on
these
points
and
especially
on
the
last
peter
and
his
companions
fell
at
the
missioners
feet
exclaiming
with
delight
thanks
thanks
they
are
virgins
and
true
disciples
of
our
apostle
a
contemporary
writer
has
wittily
remarked
that
perhaps
the
most
ardent
admirer
of
hymeneal
rites
would
cheerfully
admit
that
he
could
not
conceive
paul
or
john
starting
on
a
nuptial
tour
accompanied
by
the
latest
fashions
from
athens
or
ephesus
and
the
graceful
brides
whom
they
were
destined
to
adorn
they
would
feel
that
christianity
itself
could
not
survive
such
a
vision
as
that
nor
could
the
imagination
in
its
wildest
moods
picture
the
majestic
adversary
of
the
arian
emperor
attended
in
his
flight
up
the
nile
by
mistress
athanasius
nor
john
chrysostom
escorted
in
his
wanderings
through
phrygia
by
the
wife
of
his
bosom
arrayed
in
a
wreath
of
would
ethelbert
have
become
a
christian
if
augustine
had
introduced
to
him
his
lady
and
her
bridesmaids
we
frequently
hear
of
unmarried
bishops
and
priests
laying
down
their
lives
for
the
faith
in
china
and
corea
and
imprisoned
in
germany
heroic
sacrifices
such
as
these
are
however
too
much
to
be
expected
from
men
enjoying
the
domestic
luxury
and
engrossed
by
the
responsibility
of
a
wife
and
children
but
does
not
paul
authorize
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
when
he
says
have
we
not
power
to
carry
about
a
woman
a
sister
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
apostles
the
protestant
text
this
passage
by
substituting
the
word
for
it
is
evident
that
paul
does
not
speak
here
of
his
wife
since
he
had
none
but
he
alludes
to
those
pious
women
who
voluntarily
waited
on
the
apostles
and
ministered
to
them
in
their
missionary
journeys
it
is
also
objected
that
the
apostle
seems
to
require
that
a
bishop
be
the
husband
of
one
the
context
certainly
can
not
mean
that
a
bishop
must
be
a
married
man
for
the
reason
already
given
that
paul
himself
was
never
married
the
sense
of
the
text
as
all
tradition
testifies
is
that
no
candidate
should
be
elected
to
the
office
of
bishop
who
had
been
married
more
than
once
it
was
not
possible
in
those
days
always
to
select
single
men
for
the
episcopal
office
hence
the
church
was
often
compelled
to
choose
married
persons
but
always
with
this
restriction
that
they
had
never
contracted
nuptials
a
second
time
they
were
obliged
moreover
if
not
widowers
to
live
separated
from
their
wives
others
adduce
against
clerical
celibacy
these
words
of
paul
in
the
last
times
some
shall
depart
from
the
faith
giving
heed
to
spirits
of
error
forbidding
to
this
passage
however
alludes
to
the
ebionites
gnostics
and
manicheans
who
positively
taught
that
marriage
is
sinful
the
catholic
church
on
the
contrary
holds
that
matrimony
is
not
only
a
lawful
state
for
those
who
are
called
to
embrace
it
but
that
it
is
also
a
sacrament
and
that
the
highest
degree
of
holiness
is
attainable
in
conjugal
life
some
go
so
far
as
to
declare
continency
impracticable
our
dissenting
brethren
in
the
ministry
are
so
uxoriously
inclined
that
perhaps
for
this
reason
they
dispute
the
possibility
as
well
as
the
privilege
of
priests
to
remain
single
but
in
making
this
assertion
they
impugn
the
wisdom
of
jesus
christ
and
his
apostle
who
lived
in
this
state
and
recommended
it
to
others
they
slander
consecrated
priests
and
nuns
and
they
unwittingly
question
the
purity
of
their
own
unmarried
sisters
daughters
and
sons
how
many
men
and
women
are
there
in
the
world
who
spend
years
nay
their
whole
lives
in
the
single
state
and
who
shall
dare
to
accuse
such
a
multitude
of
incontinency
nor
should
any
one
complain
of
the
severity
of
the
law
of
clerical
celibacy
since
the
candidate
voluntarily
accepts
the
obligations
after
mature
consideration
finally
it
can
not
be
urged
against
celibacy
that
it
violates
the
divine
precept
to
increase
and
multiply
for
this
command
surely
can
not
require
all
marriageable
persons
to
be
united
in
wedlock
otherwise
bachelors
and
spinsters
would
also
be
guilty
of
violating
the
law
the
number
of
men
and
women
consecrated
to
god
by
vows
of
chastity
forms
but
an
imperceptible
fraction
of
the
human
family
their
proportion
in
the
united
states
for
instance
being
only
one
individual
to
about
every
four
thousand
moreover
it
is
an
incontrovertible
fact
that
the
population
increases
most
in
those
countries
in
which
the
catholic
clergy
exercise
the
strongest
influence
for
there
married
people
are
impressed
with
the
idea
that
marriage
was
instituted
not
for
the
gratification
of
the
flesh
but
for
the
procreation
and
christian
education
of
children
chapter
xxxi
matrimony
matrimony
is
not
only
a
natural
contract
between
husband
and
wife
but
it
has
been
elevated
for
christians
by
jesus
christ
to
the
dignity
of
a
sacrament
husbands
says
the
apostle
love
your
wives
as
christ
also
loved
the
church
and
delivered
himself
up
for
it
so
also
ought
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
his
father
and
mother
and
shall
adhere
to
his
wife
and
they
shall
be
one
flesh
this
is
a
great
sacrament
but
i
speak
in
christ
and
in
the
in
these
words
the
apostle
declares
that
the
union
of
christ
with
his
church
is
the
type
or
model
of
the
bond
subsisting
between
man
and
wife
now
the
union
between
christ
and
his
church
is
supernatural
and
sealed
by
divine
grace
hence
also
is
the
fellowship
of
a
christian
husband
and
wife
cemented
by
the
grace
of
god
the
wedded
couple
are
bound
to
love
one
another
during
their
whole
lives
as
christ
has
loved
his
church
and
to
discharge
the
virtues
proper
to
the
married
state
in
order
to
fulfil
these
duties
special
graces
of
our
savior
are
required
the
fathers
councils
and
liturgies
of
the
western
and
the
oriental
churches
including
the
coptic
jacobite
syriac
nestorian
and
other
schismatic
bodies
which
for
upwards
of
fourteen
centuries
have
been
separated
from
the
catholic
communion
all
agree
in
recognizing
christian
marriage
as
a
sacrament
hence
the
council
of
trent
speaking
of
matrimony
says
christ
himself
the
institutor
and
perfector
of
the
venerable
sacraments
merited
for
us
by
his
passion
the
grace
which
might
perfect
that
natural
love
and
confirm
that
indissoluble
union
and
sanctify
the
married
as
the
apostle
paul
intimates
saying
husbands
love
your
wives
as
christ
also
loved
the
church
and
delivered
himself
for
it
adding
shortly
after
this
is
a
great
sacrament
but
i
speak
in
christ
and
in
the
ephes
whereas
therefore
matrimony
in
the
evangelical
law
excels
in
grace
through
christ
the
ancient
marriages
with
reason
have
our
holy
fathers
and
councils
and
the
tradition
of
the
universal
church
always
taught
that
it
is
to
be
numbered
among
the
sacraments
of
the
new
the
gospel
forbids
a
man
to
have
more
than
one
wife
and
a
wife
to
have
more
than
one
husband
have
you
not
read
says
our
savior
that
he
who
made
man
in
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
and
he
said
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
unto
wife
and
they
two
shall
be
in
one
wherefore
they
are
no
more
two
but
one
our
lord
recalls
marriage
to
its
primitive
institution
as
it
was
ordained
by
almighty
god
gen
ii
now
marriage
in
its
primitive
ordinance
was
the
union
of
one
man
with
one
woman
for
jehovah
created
but
one
helpmate
to
adam
he
would
have
created
more
if
his
design
had
been
to
establish
polygamy
the
scripture
says
that
man
shall
adhere
to
his
it
does
not
declare
that
they
shall
be
three
or
more
but
that
they
shall
be
two
in
one
hence
mormonism
unhappily
so
prevalent
in
the
united
states
is
at
variance
with
the
plain
teachings
of
the
gospel
and
is
consequently
condemned
by
the
catholic
church
polygamy
wherever
it
exists
can
not
fail
to
be
a
perpetual
source
of
family
discord
and
feuds
it
fosters
deadly
jealousy
and
hate
among
the
wives
of
the
same
household
it
deranges
the
laws
of
succession
and
primogeniture
and
breeds
rivalry
among
the
children
each
endeavoring
to
supplant
the
other
in
the
affections
and
the
inheritance
of
their
common
father
marriage
is
the
most
inviolable
and
irrevocable
of
all
contracts
that
were
ever
formed
every
human
compact
may
be
lawfully
dissolved
but
this
nations
may
be
justified
in
abrogating
treaties
with
each
other
merchants
may
dissolve
partnerships
brothers
will
eventually
leave
the
paternal
roof
and
like
jacob
and
esau
separate
from
one
another
friends
like
abraham
and
lot
may
be
obliged
to
part
company
but
by
the
law
of
god
the
bond
uniting
husband
and
wife
can
be
dissolved
only
by
death
no
earthly
sword
can
sever
the
nuptial
knot
which
the
lord
has
tied
for
what
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
three
of
the
evangelists
as
well
as
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
proclaim
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
and
forbid
a
wedded
person
to
engage
in
second
wedlock
during
the
life
of
his
spouse
there
is
indeed
scarcely
a
moral
precept
more
strongly
enforced
in
the
gospel
than
the
indissoluble
character
of
marriage
validly
contracted
the
pharisees
came
to
jesus
tempting
him
and
saying
is
it
lawful
for
a
man
to
put
away
his
wife
for
every
cause
who
answering
said
to
them
have
ye
not
read
that
he
who
made
man
from
the
beginning
made
them
male
and
female
and
he
said
for
this
cause
shall
a
man
leave
father
and
mother
and
shall
cleave
to
his
wife
and
they
two
shall
be
one
flesh
therefore
now
they
are
not
two
but
one
flesh
what
therefore
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
they
say
to
him
why
then
did
moses
command
to
give
a
bill
of
divorce
and
to
put
away
he
said
to
them
because
moses
by
reason
of
the
hardness
of
your
heart
permitted
you
to
put
away
your
wives
but
from
the
beginning
it
was
not
so
and
i
say
to
you
that
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
except
it
be
for
fornication
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
adultery
and
he
that
shall
marry
her
that
is
put
away
committeth
our
savior
here
emphatically
declares
that
the
nuptial
bond
is
ratified
by
god
himself
and
hence
that
no
man
nor
any
legislation
framed
by
men
can
validly
dissolve
the
contract
to
the
pharisees
interposing
this
objection
if
marriage
is
not
to
be
dissolved
why
then
did
moses
command
to
give
a
divorce
our
lord
replies
that
moses
did
not
command
but
simply
the
separation
and
that
in
tolerating
this
indulgence
the
great
lawgiver
had
regard
to
the
violent
passion
of
the
jewish
people
who
would
fall
into
a
greater
excess
if
their
desire
to
be
divorced
and
to
form
a
new
alliance
were
refused
but
our
savior
reminded
them
that
in
the
primitive
times
no
such
license
was
granted
he
then
plainly
affirms
that
such
a
privilege
would
not
be
conceded
in
the
new
dispensation
for
he
adds
i
say
to
you
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
and
shall
marry
another
committeth
protestant
commentators
erroneously
assert
that
the
text
justifies
an
injured
husband
in
separating
from
his
adulterous
wife
and
in
marrying
again
but
the
catholic
church
explains
the
gospel
in
the
sense
that
while
the
offended
consort
may
obtain
a
divorce
from
bed
and
board
from
his
unfaithful
wife
he
is
not
allowed
a
divorce
vinculo
so
as
to
have
the
privilege
of
marrying
another
this
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
concurrent
testimony
of
the
evangelists
mark
and
luke
and
by
paul
all
of
whom
prohibit
divorce
without
any
qualification
whatever
in
mark
we
read
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
and
marry
another
committeth
adultery
against
her
and
if
the
wife
shall
put
away
her
husband
and
be
married
to
another
she
committeth
the
same
unqualified
declaration
is
made
by
luke
every
one
that
putteth
away
his
wife
and
marrieth
another
committeth
adultery
and
he
that
marrieth
her
that
is
put
away
from
her
husband
committeth
both
of
these
evangelists
forbid
either
husband
or
wife
to
enter
into
second
wedlock
how
aggravating
soever
may
be
the
cause
of
their
separation
and
surely
if
the
case
of
adultery
authorized
the
aggrieved
husband
to
marry
another
wife
those
inspired
penmen
would
not
have
failed
to
mention
that
qualifying
circumstance
passing
from
the
gospels
to
the
epistle
of
paul
to
the
corinthians
we
find
there
also
an
absolute
prohibition
of
divorce
the
apostle
is
writing
to
a
city
newly
converted
to
the
christian
religion
among
other
topics
he
inculcates
the
doctrine
of
the
church
respecting
matrimony
we
must
suppose
that
as
an
inspired
writer
and
a
faithful
minister
of
the
word
he
discharges
his
duty
conscientiously
without
suppressing
or
extenuating
one
iota
of
the
law
he
addresses
the
corinthians
as
follows
to
them
that

not

but
the
lord
commandeth
that
the
wife
depart
not
from
her
husband
and
if
she
depart
that
she
remain
unmarried
or
be
reconciled
to
her
husband
and
let
not
the
husband
put
away
his
here
we
find
the
apostle
in
his
master
s
name
commanding
the
separated
couple
to
remain
unmarried
without
any
reference
to
the
case
of
adultery
if
so
important
an
exception
existed
paul
would
not
have
omitted
to
mention
it
otherwise
he
would
have
rendered
the
gospel
yoke
more
grievous
than
its
founder
intended
we
must
therefore
admit
that
according
to
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
conjugal
infidelity
does
not
warrant
either
party
to
marry
again
or
we
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
vast
number
of
christians
whose
knowledge
of
christianity
was
derived
solely
from
the
teachings
of
saints
mark
luke
and
paul
were
imperfectly
instructed
in
their
faith
nor
can
we
suppose
that
matthew
gave
to
the
married
christians
of
palestine
a
privilege
which
paul
withheld
from
the
corinthians
for
then
the
early
christian
church
might
have
witnessed
the
disedifying
spectacle
of
aggrieved
husbands
seeking
in
judea
for
a
divorce
from
their
adulterous
wives
which
they
could
not
obtain
in
corinth
just
as
discontented
spouses
in
our
times
sue
in
a
neighboring
state
for
a
legal
separation
which
is
denied
them
in
their
own
christ
is
not
divided
nor
do
the
apostles
contradict
one
another
the
catholic
church
following
the
light
of
the
gospel
forbids
a
divorced
man
to
enter
into
second
espousals
during
the
life
of
his
former
partner
this
is
the
inflexible
law
she
first
proclaimed
in
the
face
of
pagan
emperors
and
people
and
which
she
has
ever
upheld
in
spite
of
the
passions
and
voluptuousness
of
her
own
rebellious
children
henry
once
an
obedient
son
and
defender
of
the
church
conceived
in
an
evil
hour
a
criminal
attachment
for
anne
boleyn
a
lady
of
the
queen
s
household
whom
he
desired
to
marry
after
being
divorced
from
his
lawful
consort
catherine
of
arragon
but
pope
clement
whose
sanction
he
solicited
sternly
refused
to
ratify
the
separation
though
the
pontiff
could
have
easily
forseen
that
his
determined
action
would
involve
the
church
in
persecution
and
a
whole
nation
in
the
unhappy
schism
of
its
ruler
had
the
pope
acquiesced
in
the
repudiation
of
catherine
and
in
the
marriage
of
anne
boleyn
england
would
indeed
have
been
spared
to
the
church
but
the
church
herself
would
have
surrendered
her
peerless
title
of
mistress
of
truth
when
napoleon
repudiated
his
devoted
wife
josephine
and
married
marie
louise
of
austria
so
well
assured
was
he
of
the
fruitlessness
of
his
attempt
to
obtain
from
the
holy
see
the
sanction
of
his
divorce
and
subsequent
marriage
that
he
did
not
even
consult
the
holy
father
on
the
subject
a
few
years
previously
napoleon
appealed
to
pius
vii
to
annul
the
marriage
which
his
brother
jerome
had
contracted
with
miss
patterson
of
baltimore
the
pope
sent
the
following
reply
to
the
emperor
your
majesty
will
understand
that
upon
the
information
thus
far
received
by
us
it
is
not
in
our
power
to
pronounce
a
sentence
of
nullity
we
can
not
utter
a
judgment
in
opposition
to
the
rules
of
the
church
and
we
could
not
without
laying
aside
those
rules
decree
the
invalidity
of
a
union
which
according
to
the
word
of
god
no
human
power
can
christian
wives
and
mothers
what
gratitude
you
owe
to
the
catholic
church
for
the
honorable
position
you
now
hold
in
society
if
you
are
no
longer
regarded
as
the
slave
but
the
equal
of
your
husband
if
you
are
no
longer
the
toy
of
his
caprice
and
liable
to
be
discarded
at
any
moment
like
the
women
of
turkey
and
the
mormon
wives
of
utah
but
if
you
are
recognized
as
the
mistress
and
queen
of
your
household
you
owe
your
emancipation
to
the
church
you
are
especially
indebted
for
your
liberty
to
the
popes
who
rose
up
in
all
the
majesty
of
their
spiritual
power
to
vindicate
the
rights
of
injured
wives
against
the
lustful
tyranny
of
their
husbands
how
opposite
is
the
conduct
of
the
fathers
of
the
reformation
who
with
the
cry
of
religious
reform
on
their
lips
deformed
religion
and
society
by
sanctioning
divorce
henry

was
divorced
from
his

catherine
by

the
first

primate
of

luther

modern
prussia
is
now
reaping
the
bitter
fruits
of
the
seeds
that
were
then
sown
within
its
borders
per
cent
of
the
marriages
now
contracted
outside
of
the
catholic
church
in
berlin
are
performed
without
any
religious
ceremony
whatever
a
union
not
bound
by
the
strong
ties
of
religion
is
easily
dissolved
this
subject
excites
a
painful
interest
in
our
own
country
in
consequence
of
the
facility
with
which
divorce
from
the
marriage
bond
is
obtained
in
many
of
our
states
we
have
here
another
exemplification
of
the
dangerous
consequences
attending
a
private
interpretation
of
the
sacred
text
when
luther
and
calvin
proclaimed
to
the
world
that
it
was
not
wise
to
prohibit
the
divorced
adulterer
from
marrying
again
they
little
dreamed
of
the
fruitful
progeny
which
was
destined
before
long
to
spring
from
this
isolated
monster
of
their
creation
there
are
already
about
thirty
causes
which
allow
the
conjugal
tie
to
be
broken
some
of
which
are
of
so
trifling
a
nature
as
to
provoke
merriment
were
it
not
for
the
gravity
of
the
subject
which
is
well
calculated
to
excite
alarm
for
the
moral
and
social
welfare
of
our
country
persons
are
divorced
by
the
courts
not
only
for
infidelity
but
also
without
even
the
shadow
of
scripture
alleged
cruelty
intemperance
desertion
prolonged
absence
mental
incapacity
sentence
to
the
penitentiary
incompatibility
of
temper
and
other
causes
as
the
court
in
its
discretion
may
deem
for
the
year
ending
june
seventeen
hundred
and
applications
for
divorce
were
presented
in
the
state
of
ohio
if
such
is
ohio
s
record
what
must
be
the
matrimonial
condition
of
indiana
which
is
called
the
paradise
of
discontented
spouses
in
connecticut
there
were
in
four
thousand
three
hundred
and
marriages
and
four
hundred
and
divorces
from
the
marriage
bond
the
number
of
divorces
obtained
in
the
same
state
during
the
last
fifteen
years
has
reached
five
thousand
three
hundred
and
this
is
the
record
of
a
state
whose
public
school
system
is
considered
the
most
thorough
and
perfect
in
the
country
the
statistics
given
of
ohio
and
connecticut
will
enable
us
to
form
some
idea
of
the
fearful
catalogue
of
divorces
annually
obtained
in
the
united
states
there
are
some
who
regard
the
catholic
church
as
too
severe
in
proclaiming
the
absolute
indissolubility
of
marriage
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
it
is
not
the
church
but
the
divine
founder
of
the
christian
religion
that
has
given
us
the
law
she
merely
enforces
its
observance
the
law
how
rigorous
soever
is
mercy
itself
when
compared
with
the
cruel
consequences
which
follow
from
the
easy
concession
of
divorce
the
facility
with
which
marriage
is
annulled
is
most
injurious
to
the
morals
of
individuals
of
the
family
and
of
society
it
leads
to
and
hasty
marriages
because
persons
are
less
circumspect
in
making
a
compact
which
may
be
afterwards
dissolved
almost
at
will
it
stimulates
a
discontented
and
unprincipled
husband
or
wife
to
lawlessness
quarrels
and
even
adultery
well
knowing
that
the
very
crime
will
afford
a
pretext
and
legal
grounds
for
a
separation
it
engenders
between
husband
and
wife
fierce
litigations
about
the
custody
of
their
offspring
it
deprives
the
children
of
the
protecting
arm
of
a
father
or
of
the
gentle
care
of
a
mother
and
too
frequently
consigns
them
to
the
cold
charity
of
the
world
for
the
married
couple
who
are
wanting
in
conjugal
love
for
one
another
are
too
often
destitute
also
of
parental
affection
in
a
word
it
brings
into
the
household
a
blight
and
desolation
which
neither
wealth
nor
luxury
can
repair
there
is
but
one
remedy
to
this
social
distemper
and
that
is
an
absolute
prohibition
of
divorce
in
accordance
with
the
inflexible
rule
of
the
gospel
and
of
the
ancient
church
in
catholic
countries
divorces
are
exceedingly
rare
and
are
obtained
only
by
such
as
have
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
the
church
if
the
sacred
laws
of
matrimony
are
still
happily
observed
by
so
large
a
portion
of
the
protestant
community
the
purity
of
morals
is
in
no
small
measure
due
to
the
presence
among
them
of
the
catholic
religion
which
exercises
a
beneficial
influence
even
over

dare
say
you
could
have
found
a
few
years
since
some
persons
in
the
united
states
who
entertained
a
holy
fear
lest
the
pope
should
one
morning
land
upon
our
shores
and
take
forcible
possession
of
our
country
a
venerable
clergyman
once
informed
me
that
when
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
president
pierce
who
then
occupied
the
white
house
his
excellency
remarked
to
him
i
had
a
visit
from
a
nervous
gentleman
who
asked
me
whether
i
was
making
any
preparations
to
resist
the
approach
of
the
pope
i
replied
that
so
far
i
had
taken
no
steps
but
that
no
doubt
i
would
be
prepared
to
meet
the
enemy
when
he
arrived
the
man
retired
more
composed
though
not
fully
some
of
the
evils
that
were
predicted
to
follow
from
the
occupation
of
rome
by
a
foreign
power
have
been
too
speedily
realized
already
several
convents
and
other
ecclesiastical
institutions
have
been
seized
and
sold
and
their
inmates
sent
adrift
a
number
of
colleges
founded
and
endowed
by
the
piety
of
foreign
catholics
have
been
confiscated
public
religious
processions
through
the
streets
of
rome
have
been
prohibited
these
and
other
outrages
are
perpetrated
by
a
government
which
solemnly
pledged
itself
to
maintain
inviolate
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
holy
father
when
it
took
forcible
possession
of
his
city
in
from
the
events
that
have
already
transpired
we
shall
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
pope
still
more
seriously
hampered
by
a
monarch
who
has
unscrupulously
violated
his
former
guarantees

when
these
lines
were
written
pius
ix
was
the
reigning
pontiff
he
died
february
some
time
ago
my
attention
was
called
to
a
certain
excommunication
or
curse
then
widely
circulated
by
the
press
of
north
carolina
the
curse
is
attributed
to
the
holy
father
and
is
fulminated
against
victor
emmanuel
in
this
anathema
and
are
heaped
up
in
wild
confusion
when
this
base
forgery
appeared
an
article
exposing
the
falsehood
of
the
production
was
published
we
fear
however
that
many
who
read
the
slanderous
charge
did
not
read
its
refutation
