the
at
the
bay
chapter
very
early
morning
the
sun
was
not
yet
risen
and
the
whole
of
crescent
bay
was
hidden
under
a
white
the
big
hills
at
the
back
were
smothered
you
could
not
see
where
they
ended
and
the
paddocks
and
bungalows
began
the
sandy
road
was
gone
and
the
paddocks
and
bungalows
the
other
side
of
it
there
were
no
white
dunes
covered
with
reddish
grass
beyond
them
there
was
nothing
to
mark
which
was
beach
and
where
was
the
sea
a
heavy
dew
had
fallen
the
grass
was
blue
big
drops
hung
on
the
bushes
and
just
did
not
fall
the
silvery
fluffy
was
limp
on
its
long
stalks
and
all
the
marigolds
and
the
pinks
in
the
bungalow
gardens
were
bowed
to
the
earth
with
wetness
drenched
were
the
cold
fuchsias
round
pearls
of
dew
lay
on
the
flat
nasturtium
leaves
it
looked
as
though
the
sea
had
beaten
up
softly
in
the
darkness
as
though
one
immense
wave
had
come
rippling
rippling
how
far
perhaps
if
you
had
waked
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
might
have
seen
a
big
fish
flicking
in
at
the
window
and
gone
again
sounded
the
sleepy
sea
and
from
the
bush
there
came
the
sound
of
little
streams
flowing
quickly
lightly
slipping
between
the
smooth
stones
gushing
into
ferny
basins
and
out
again
and
there
was
the
splashing
of
big
drops
on
large
leaves
and
something
else
what
was
it
a
faint
stirring
and
shaking
the
snapping
of
a
twig
and
then
such
silence
that
it
seemed
some
one
was
listening
round
the
corner
of
crescent
bay
between
the
masses
of
broken
rock
a
flock
of
sheep
came
pattering
they
were
huddled
together
a
small
tossing
woolly
mass
and
their
thin
legs
trotted
along
quickly
as
if
the
cold
and
the
quiet
had
frightened
them
behind
them
an
old
his
soaking
paws
covered
with
sand
ran
along
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
but
carelessly
as
if
thinking
of
something
else
and
then
in
the
rocky
gateway
the
shepherd
himself
appeared
he
was
a
lean
upright
old
man
in
a
frieze
coat
that
was
covered
with
a
web
of
tiny
drops
velvet
trousers
tied
under
the
knee
and
a
with
a
folded
blue
handkerchief
round
the
brim
one
hand
was
crammed
into
his
belt
the
other
grasped
a
beautifully
smooth
yellow
stick
and
as
he
walked
taking
his
time
he
kept
up
a
very
soft
light
whistling
an
airy
fluting
that
sounded
mournful
and
tender
the
old
dog
cut
an
ancient
caper
or
two
and
then
drew
up
sharp
ashamed
of
his
levity
and
walked
a
few
dignified
paces
by
his
master
side
the
sheep
ran
forward
in
little
pattering
rushes
they
began
to
bleat
and
ghostly
flocks
and
herds
answered
them
from
under
the
sea
baa
baaa
for
a
time
they
seemed
to
be
always
on
the
same
piece
of
ground
there
ahead
was
stretched
the
sandy
road
with
shallow
puddles
the
same
soaking
bushes
showed
on
either
side
and
the
same
shadowy
palings
then
something
immense
came
into
view
an
enormous
giant
with
his
arms
stretched
out
it
was
the
big
outside
shop
and
as
they
passed
by
there
was
a
strong
whiff
of
eucalyptus
and
now
big
spots
of
light
gleamed
in
the
mist
the
shepherd
stopped
whistling
he
rubbed
his
red
nose
and
wet
beard
on
his
wet
sleeve
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
the
sun
was
rising
it
was
marvellous
how
quickly
the
mist
thinned
sped
away
dissolved
from
the
shallow
plain
rolled
up
from
the
bush
and
was
gone
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
escape
big
twists
and
curls
jostled
and
shouldered
each
other
as
the
silvery
beams
broadened
the
sky
a
bright
pure
blue
was
reflected
in
the
puddles
and
the
drops
swimming
along
the
telegraph
poles
flashed
into
points
of
light
now
the
leaping
glittering
sea
was
so
bright
it
made
one
eyes
ache
to
look
at
it
the
shepherd
drew
a
pipe
the
bowl
as
small
as
an
acorn
out
of
his
breast
pocket
fumbled
for
a
chunk
of
speckled
tobacco
pared
off
a
few
shavings
and
stuffed
the
bowl
he
was
a
grave
old
man
as
he
lit
up
and
the
blue
smoke
wreathed
his
head
the
dog
watching
looked
proud
of
him
baa
baaa
the
sheep
spread
out
into
a
fan
they
were
just
clear
of
the
summer
colony
before
the
first
sleeper
turned
over
and
lifted
a
drowsy
head
their
cry
sounded
in
the
dreams
of
little
children
who
lifted
their
arms
to
drag
down
to
cuddle
the
darling
little
woolly
lambs
of
sleep
then
the
first
inhabitant
appeared
it
was
the
cat
florrie
sitting
on
the
gatepost
far
too
early
as
usual
looking
for
their
when
she
saw
the
old
she
sprang
up
quickly
arched
her
back
drew
in
her
tabby
head
and
seemed
to
give
a
little
fastidious
shiver
ugh
what
a
coarse
revolting
creature
said
florrie
but
the
old
not
looking
up
waggled
past
flinging
out
his
legs
from
side
to
side
only
one
of
his
ears
twitched
to
prove
that
he
saw
and
thought
her
a
silly
young
female
the
breeze
of
morning
lifted
in
the
bush
and
the
smell
of
leaves
and
wet
black
earth
mingled
with
the
sharp
smell
of
the
sea
myriads
of
birds
were
singing
a
goldfinch
flew
over
the
shepherd
head
and
perching
on
the
tiptop
of
a
spray
it
turned
to
the
sun
ruffling
its
small
breast
feathers
and
now
they
had
passed
the
fisherman
hut
passed
the
little
whare
where
leila
the
lived
with
her
old
gran
the
sheep
strayed
over
a
yellow
swamp
and
wag
the
padded
after
rounded
them
up
and
headed
them
for
the
steeper
narrower
rocky
pass
that
led
out
of
crescent
bay
and
towards
daylight
cove
baa
baa
faint
the
cry
came
as
they
rocked
along
the
road
the
shepherd
put
away
his
pipe
dropping
it
into
his
so
that
the
little
bowl
hung
over
and
straightway
the
soft
airy
whistling
began
again
wag
ran
out
along
a
ledge
of
rock
after
something
that
smelled
and
ran
back
again
disgusted
then
pushing
nudging
hurrying
the
sheep
rounded
the
bend
and
the
shepherd
followed
after
out
of
sight
chapter
a
few
moments
later
the
back
door
of
one
of
the
bungalows
opened
and
a
figure
in
a
bathing
suit
flung
down
the
paddock
cleared
the
stile
rushed
through
the
tussock
grass
into
the
hollow
staggered
up
the
sandy
hillock
and
raced
for
dear
life
over
the
big
porous
stones
over
the
cold
wet
pebbles
on
to
the
hard
sand
that
gleamed
like
oil
the
water
bubbled
round
his
legs
as
stanley
burnell
waded
out
exulting
first
man
in
as
usual
beaten
them
all
again
and
he
swooped
down
to
souse
his
head
and
neck
hail
brother
all
hail
thou
mighty
one
a
velvety
bass
voice
came
booming
over
the
water
great
scott
damnation
take
it
stanley
lifted
up
to
see
a
dark
head
bobbing
far
out
and
an
arm
lifted
it
was
jonathan
trout
there
before
him
glorious
morning
sang
the
voice
yes
very
fine
said
stanley
briefly
why
the
dickens
did
the
fellow
stick
to
his
part
of
the
sea
why
should
he
come
barging
over
to
this
exact
spot
stanley
gave
a
kick
a
lunge
and
struck
out
swimming
overarm
but
jonathan
was
a
match
for
him
up
he
came
his
black
hair
sleek
on
his
forehead
his
short
beard
sleek
i
had
an
extraordinary
dream
last
night
he
shouted
what
was
the
matter
with
the
man
this
mania
for
conversation
irritated
stanley
beyond
words
and
it
was
always
the
same
always
some
piffle
about
a
dream
he
had
or
some
cranky
idea
he
got
hold
of
or
some
rot
he
been
reading
stanley
turned
over
on
his
back
and
kicked
with
his
legs
till
he
was
a
living
waterspout
but
even
then
i
dreamed
i
was
hanging
over
a
terrifically
high
cliff
shouting
to
some
one
you
would
be
thought
stanley
he
could
stick
no
more
of
it
he
stopped
splashing
look
here
trout
he
said
i
in
rather
a
hurry
this
you
what
jonathan
was
so
surprised
or
pretended
to
be
that
he
sank
under
the
water
then
reappeared
again
blowing
all
i
mean
is
said
stanley
i
no
time
to
to
to
fool
about
i
want
to
get
this
over
i
in
a
hurry
i
work
to
do
this
morning
see
jonathan
was
gone
before
stanley
had
finished
pass
friend
said
the
bass
voice
gently
and
he
slid
away
through
the
water
with
scarcely
a
ripple
but
curse
the
fellow
he
ruined
stanley
bathe
what
an
unpractical
idiot
the
man
was
stanley
struck
out
to
sea
again
and
then
as
quickly
swam
in
again
and
away
he
rushed
up
the
beach
he
felt
cheated
jonathan
stayed
a
little
longer
in
the
water
he
floated
gently
moving
his
hands
like
fins
and
letting
the
sea
rock
his
long
skinny
body
it
was
curious
but
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
fond
of
stanley
burnell
true
he
had
a
fiendish
desire
to
tease
him
sometimes
to
poke
fun
at
him
but
at
bottom
he
was
sorry
for
the
fellow
there
was
something
pathetic
in
his
determination
to
make
a
job
of
everything
you
help
feeling
he
be
caught
out
one
day
and
then
what
an
almighty
cropper
he
come
at
that
moment
an
immense
wave
lifted
jonathan
rode
past
him
and
broke
along
the
beach
with
a
joyful
sound
what
a
beauty
and
now
there
came
another
that
was
the
way
to
live
carelessly
recklessly
spending
oneself
he
got
on
to
his
feet
and
began
to
wade
towards
the
shore
pressing
his
toes
into
the
firm
wrinkled
sand
to
take
things
easy
not
to
fight
against
the
ebb
and
flow
of
life
but
to
give
way
to
it
that
was
what
was
needed
it
was
this
tension
that
was
all
wrong
to
live
to
live
and
the
perfect
morning
so
fresh
and
fair
basking
in
the
light
as
though
laughing
at
its
own
beauty
seemed
to
whisper
why
not
but
now
he
was
out
of
the
water
jonathan
turned
blue
with
cold
he
ached
all
over
it
was
as
though
some
one
was
wringing
the
blood
out
of
him
and
stalking
up
the
beach
shivering
all
his
muscles
tight
he
too
felt
his
bathe
was
spoilt
he
stayed
in
too
long
chapter
beryl
was
alone
in
the
when
stanley
appeared
wearing
a
blue
serge
suit
a
stiff
collar
and
a
spotted
tie
he
looked
almost
uncannily
clean
and
brushed
he
was
going
to
town
for
the
day
dropping
into
his
chair
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
put
it
beside
his
plate
i
just
got
minutes
he
said
you
might
go
and
see
if
the
porridge
is
ready
beryl
mother
just
gone
for
it
said
beryl
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
poured
out
his
tea
thanks
stanley
took
a
sip
hallo
he
said
in
an
astonished
voice
you
forgotten
the
oh
sorry
but
even
then
beryl
did
help
him
she
pushed
the
basin
across
what
did
this
mean
as
stanley
helped
himself
his
blue
eyes
widened
they
seemed
to
quiver
he
shot
a
quick
glance
at
his
and
leaned
back
nothing
wrong
is
there
he
asked
carelessly
fingering
his
collar
beryl
head
was
bent
she
turned
her
plate
in
her
fingers
nothing
said
her
light
voice
then
she
too
looked
up
and
smiled
at
stanley
why
should
there
be
no
reason
at
all
as
far
as
i
know
i
thought
you
seemed
rather
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
three
little
girls
appeared
each
carrying
a
porridge
plate
they
were
dressed
alike
in
blue
jerseys
and
knickers
their
brown
legs
were
bare
and
each
had
her
hair
plaited
and
pinned
up
in
what
was
called
a
horse
tail
behind
them
came
fairfield
with
the
tray
carefully
children
she
warned
but
they
were
taking
the
very
greatest
care
they
loved
being
allowed
to
carry
things

said

your
father

settled
themselves
on
the
bench
opposite
stanley

beryl

plate

mother
how
the

he
only
woke

once
last

what
a
perfect
morning
the
old
woman
paused
her
hand
on
the
loaf
of
bread
to
gaze
out
of
the
open
door
into
the
garden
the
sea
sounded
through
the
window
streamed
the
sun
on
to
the
yellow
varnished
walls
and
bare
floor
everything
on
the
table
flashed
and
glittered
in
the
middle
there
was
an
old
salad
bowl
filled
with
yellow
and
red
nasturtiums
she
smiled
and
a
look
of
deep
content
shone
in
her
eyes
you
might
cut
me
a
slice
of
that
bread

and
swung
down

garden
path

beryl
leaning
over
the
open
gate
was
laughing
up
at
somebody
or
other
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
heartlessness
of
women
the
way
they
took
it
for
granted

trouble
to

kelly

his
whip
across

horses
stanley
called
beryl
sweetly
and
gaily
it
was
easy
enough
to
say

there
she
stood
idle
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
the
worst
of
it
was
stanley
had
to
shout
too
for
the
sake
of
appearances
then
he
saw

a
little
skip
and
run

his
little
flannel
coatee
gone
gone
oh
the
relief
the
difference
it
made
to
have
the
man
out
of
the
house
their
very
voices
were
changed
as
they
called
to
one
another
they
sounded
warm
and
loving
and
as
if
they
shared
a
secret
beryl
went
over
to
the
table
have
another
cup
of
tea
mother
it
still
she
wanted
somehow
to
celebrate
the
fact
that
they
could
do
what
they
liked
now
there
was
no
man
to
disturb
them
the
whole
perfect
day
was
theirs
no
thank
you
child
said
old
fairfield
but
the
way
at
that
moment
she
tossed
the
boy
up
and
said
to
him
meant
that
she
felt
the
same
the
little
girls
ran
into
the
paddock
like
chickens
let
out
of
a
coop
even
alice
the
washing
up
the
dishes
in
the
kitchen
caught
the
infection
and
used
the
precious
tank
water
in
a
perfectly
reckless
fashion
oh
these
men
said
she
and
she
plunged
the
teapot
into
the
bowl
and
held
it
under
the
water
even
after
it
had
stopped
bubbling
as
if
it
too
was
a
man
and
drowning
was
too
good
for
them
chapter
wait
for
me
kezia
wait
for
me
there
was
poor
little
lottie
left
behind
again
because
she
found
it
so
fearfully
hard
to
get
over
the
stile
by
herself
when
she
stood
on
the
first
step
her
knees
began
to
wobble
she
grasped
the
post
then
you
had
to
put
one
leg
over
but
which
leg
she
never
could
decide
and
when
she
did
finally
put
one
leg
over
with
a
sort
of
stamp
of
despair
then
the
feeling
was
awful
she
was
half
in
the
paddock
still
and
half
in
the
tussock
grass
she
clutched
the
post
desperately
and
lifted
up
her
voice
wait
for
me
no
do
you
wait
for
her
kezia
said
isabel
she
such
a
little
silly
she
always
making
a
fuss
come
on
and
she
tugged
jersey
you
can
use
my
bucket
if
you
come
with
me
she
said
kindly
it
bigger
than
but
kezia
could
leave
lottie
all
by
herself
she
ran
back
to
her
by
this
time
lottie
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
breathing
heavily
here
put
your
other
foot
over
said
kezia
where
lottie
looked
down
at
kezia
as
if
from
a
mountain
height
here
where
my
hand
kezia
patted
the
place
oh
there
do
you
mean
lottie
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
put
the
second
foot
over
now
sort
of
turn
round
and
sit
down
and
slide
said
kezia
but
there
nothing
to
sit
down
on
kezia
said
lottie
she
managed
it
at
last
and
once
it
was
over
she
shook
herself
and
began
to
beam
i
getting
better
at
climbing
over
stiles
are
i
kezia
lottie
was
a
very
hopeful
nature
the
pink
and
the
blue
sunbonnet
followed
isabel
bright
red
sunbonnet
up
that
sliding
slipping
hill
at
the
top
they
paused
to
decide
where
to
go
and
to
have
a
good
stare
at
who
was
there
already
seen
from
behind
standing
against
the
skyline
gesticulating
largely
with
their
spades
they
looked
like
minute
puzzled
explorers
the
whole
family
of
samuel
josephs
was
there
already
with
their
who
sat
on
a
and
kept
order
with
a
whistle
that
she
wore
tied
round
her
neck
and
a
small
cane
with
which
she
directed
operations
the
samuel
josephs
never
played
by
themselves
or
managed
their
own
game
if
they
did
it
ended
in
the
boys
pouring
water
down
the
girls
necks
or
the
girls
trying
to
put
little
black
crabs
into
the
boys
pockets
so
and
the
poor
drew
up
what
she
called
a
brogramme
every
morning
to
keep
them
abused
and
out
of
it
was
all
competitions
or
races
or
round
games
everything
began
with
a
piercing
blast
of
the
whistle
and
ended
with
another
there
were
even
prizes
large
rather
dirty
paper
parcels
which
the
with
a
sour
little
smile
drew
out
of
a
bulging
string
kit
the
samuel
josephs
fought
fearfully
for
the
prizes
and
cheated
and
pinched
one
another
arms
they
were
all
expert
pinchers
the
only
time
the
burnell
children
ever
played
with
them
kezia
had
got
a
prize
and
when
she
undid
three
bits
of
paper
she
found
a
very
small
rusty
she
could
understand
why
they
made
such
a
fuss
but
they
never
played
with
the
samuel
josephs
now
or
even
went
to
their
parties
the
samuel
josephs
were
always
giving
children
parties
at
the
bay
and
there
was
always
the
same
food
a
big
washhand
basin
of
very
brown
buns
cut
into
four
and
a
washhand
jug
full
of
something
the
called
and
you
went
away
in
the
evening
with
half
the
frill
torn
off
your
frock
or
something
spilled
all
down
the
front
of
your
pinafore
leaving
the
samuel
josephs
leaping
like
savages
on
their
lawn
no
they
were
too
awful
on
the
other
side
of
the
beach
close
down
to
the
water
two
little
boys
their
knickers
rolled
up
twinkled
like
spiders
one
was
digging
the
other
pattered
in
and
out
of
the
water
filling
a
small
bucket
they
were
the
trout
boys
pip
and
rags
but
pip
was
so
busy
digging
and
rags
was
so
busy
helping
that
they
did
see
their
little
cousins
until
they
were
quite
close
look
said
pip
look
what
i
and
he
showed
them
an
old
wet
boot
the
three
little
girls
stared
whatever
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
kezia
keep
it
of
course
pip
was
very
scornful
it
a
find
see
yes
kezia
saw
that
all
the
same
there
lots
of
things
buried
in
the
sand
explained
pip
they
get
chucked
up
from
wrecks
treasure
why
you
might
find
but
why
does
rags
have
to
keep
on
pouring
water
in
asked
lottie
oh
that
to
moisten
it
said
pip
to
make
the
work
a
bit
easier
keep
it
up
and
good
little
rags
ran
up
and
down
pouring
in
the
water
that
turned
brown
like
cocoa
here
shall
i
show
you
what
i
found
yesterday
said
pip
mysteriously
and
he
stuck
his
spade
into
the
sand
promise
not
to
they
promised
say
cross
my
heart
straight
the
little
girls
said
it
pip
took
something
out
of
his
pocket
rubbed
it
a
long
time
on
the
front
of
his
jersey
then
breathed
on
it
and
rubbed
it
again
now
turn
round
he
ordered
they
turned
round
all
look
the
same
way
keep
still
now
and
his
hand
opened
he
held
up
to
the
light
something
that
flashed
that
winked
that
was
a
most
lovely
green
it
a
nemeral
said
pip
solemnly
is
it
really
pip
even
isabel
was
impressed
the
lovely
green
thing
seemed
to
dance
in
pip
fingers
aunt
beryl
had
a
nemeral
in
a
ring
but
it
was
a
very
small
one
this
one
was
as
big
as
a
star
and
far
more
beautiful
chapter
as
the
morning
lengthened
whole
parties
appeared
over
the
and
came
down
on
the
beach
to
bathe
it
was
understood
that
at
eleven
the
women
and
children
of
the
summer
colony
had
the
sea
to
themselves
first
the
women
undressed
pulled
on
their
bathing
dresses
and
covered
their
heads
in
hideous
caps
like
sponge
bags
then
the
children
were
unbuttoned
the
beach
was
strewn
with
little
heaps
of
clothes
and
shoes
the
big
summer
hats
with
stones
on
them
to
keep
them
from
blowing
away
looked
like
immense
shells
it
was
strange
that
even
the
sea
seemed
to
sound
differently
when
all
those
leaping
laughing
figures
ran
into
the
waves
old
fairfield
in
a
lilac
cotton
dress
and
a
black
hat
tied
under
the
chin
gathered
her
little
brood
and
got
them
ready
the
little
trout
boys
whipped
their
shirts
over
their
heads
and
away
the
five
sped
while
their
grandma
sat
with
one
hand
in
her
ready
to
draw
out
the
ball
of
wool
when
she
was
satisfied
they
were
safely
in
the
firm
compact
little
girls
were
not
half
so
brave
as
the
tender
little
boys
pip
and
rags
shivering
crouching
down
slapping
the
water
never
hesitated
but
isabel
who
could
swim
twelve
strokes
and
kezia
who
could
nearly
swim
eight
only
followed
on
the
strict
understanding
they
were
not
to
be
splashed
as
for
lottie
she
did
follow
at
all
she
liked
to
be
left
to
go
in
her
own
way
please
and
that
way
was
to
sit
down
at
the
edge
of
the
water
her
legs
straight
her
knees
pressed
together
and
to
make
vague
motions
with
her
arms
as
if
she
expected
to
be
wafted
out
to
sea
but
when
a
bigger
wave
than
usual
an
old
whiskery
one
came
lolloping
along
in
her
direction
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
with
a
face
of
horror
and
flew
up
the
beach
again
here
mother
keep
those
for
me
will
you
two
rings
and
a
thin
gold
chain
were
dropped
into
mrs
fairfield
lap
yes
dear
but
are
you
going
to
bathe
here
beryl
drawled
she
sounded
vague
i
undressing
farther
along
i
going
to
bathe
with
harry
very
but
fairfield
lips
set
she
disapproved
of
mrs
harry
kember
beryl
knew
it
poor
old
mother
she
smiled
as
she
skimmed
over
the
stones
poor
old
mother
old
oh
what
joy
what
bliss
it
was
to
be
young
you
look
very
pleased
said
harry
kember
she
sat
hunched
up
on
the
stones
her
arms
round
her
knees
smoking
it
such
a
lovely
day
said
beryl
smiling
down
at
her
oh
my
dear
harry
kember
voice
sounded
as
though
she
knew
better
than
that
but
then
her
voice
always
sounded
as
though
she
knew
something
better
about
you
than
you
did
yourself
she
was
a
long
woman
with
narrow
hands
and
feet
her
face
too
was
long
and
narrow
and
even
her
fair
curled
fringe
looked
burnt
out
and
withered
she
was
the
only
woman
at
the
bay
who
smoked
and
she
smoked
incessantly
keeping
the
cigarette
between
her
lips
while
she
talked
and
only
taking
it
out
when
the
ash
was
so
long
you
could
not
understand
why
it
did
not
fall
when
she
was
not
playing
bridge
she
played
bridge
every
day
of
her
life
she
spent
her
time
lying
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
she
could
stand
any
amount
of
it
she
never
had
enough
all
the
same
it
did
not
seem
to
warm
her
parched
withered
cold
she
lay
stretched
on
the
stones
like
a
piece
of
driftwood
the
women
at
the
bay
thought
she
was
very
very
fast
her
lack
of
vanity
her
slang
the
way
she
treated
men
as
though
she
was
one
of
them
and
the
fact
that
she
did
care
twopence
about
her
house
and
called
the
servant
gladys
was
disgraceful
standing
on
the
veranda
steps
kember
would
call
in
her
indifferent
tired
voice
i
say
you
might
heave
me
a
handkerchief
if
i
got
one
will
you
and
a
red
bow
in
her
hair
instead
of
a
cap
and
white
shoes
came
running
with
an
impudent
smile
it
was
an
absolute
scandal
true
she
had
no
children
and
her
husband
here
the
voices
were
always
raised
they
became
fervent
how
can
he
have
married
her
how
can
he
how
can
he
it
must
have
been
money
of
course
but
even
then
kember
husband
was
at
least
ten
years
younger
than
she
was
and
so
incredibly
handsome
that
he
looked
like
a
mask
or
a
most
perfect
illustration
in
an
american
novel
rather
than
a
man
black
hair
dark
blue
eyes
red
lips
a
slow
sleepy
smile
a
fine
tennis
player
a
perfect
dancer
and
with
it
all
a
mystery
harry
kember
was
like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
men
could
stand
him
they
could
get
a
word
out
of
the
chap
he
ignored
his
wife
just
as
she
ignored
him
how
did
he
live
of
course
there
were
stories
but
such
stories
they
simply
could
be
told
the
women
he
been
seen
with
the
places
he
been
seen
in
but
nothing
was
ever
certain
nothing
definite
some
of
the
women
at
the
bay
privately
thought
he
commit
a
murder
one
day
yes
even
while
they
talked
to
kember
and
took
in
the
awful
concoction
she
was
wearing
they
saw
her
stretched
as
she
lay
on
the
beach
but
cold
bloody
and
still
with
a
cigarette
stuck
in
the
corner
of
her
mouth
kember
rose
yawned
unsnapped
her
belt
buckle
and
tugged
at
the
tape
of
her
blouse
and
beryl
stepped
out
of
her
skirt
and
shed
her
jersey
and
stood
up
in
her
short
white
petticoat
and
her
camisole
with
ribbon
bows
on
the
shoulders
mercy
on
us
said
harry
kember
what
a
little
beauty
you
are
do
said
beryl
softly
but
drawing
off
one
stocking
and
then
the
other
she
felt
a
little
beauty
my
dear
why
not
said
harry
kember
stamping
on
her
own
petticoat
really
her
underclothes
a
pair
of
blue
cotton
knickers
and
a
linen
bodice
that
reminded
one
somehow
of
a
and
you
do
wear
stays
do
you
she
touched
beryl
waist
and
beryl
sprang
away
with
a
small
affected
cry
then
never
she
said
firmly
lucky
little
creature
sighed
kember
unfastening
her
own
beryl
turned
her
back
and
began
the
complicated
movements
of
some
one
who
is
trying
to
take
off
her
clothes
and
to
pull
on
her
all
at
one
and
the
same
time
oh
my
dear
do
mind
me
said
harry
kember
why
be
shy
i
sha
eat
you
i
sha
be
shocked
like
those
other
and
she
gave
her
strange
neighing
laugh
and
grimaced
at
the
other
women
but
beryl
was
shy
she
never
undressed
in
front
of
anybody
was
that
silly
harry
kember
made
her
feel
it
was
silly
even
something
to
be
ashamed
of
why
be
shy
indeed
she
glanced
quickly
at
her
friend
standing
so
boldly
in
her
torn
chemise
and
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
and
a
quick
bold
evil
feeling
started
up
in
her
breast
laughing
recklessly
she
drew
on
the
limp
that
was
not
quite
dry
and
fastened
the
twisted
buttons
that
better
said
harry
kember
they
began
to
go
down
the
beach
together
really
it
a
sin
for
you
to
wear
clothes
my
dear
somebody
got
to
tell
you
some
the
water
was
quite
warm
it
was
that
marvellous
transparent
blue
flecked
with
silver
but
the
sand
at
the
bottom
looked
gold
when
you
kicked
with
your
toes
there
rose
a
little
puff
of
now
the
waves
just
reached
her
breast
beryl
stood
her
arms
outstretched
gazing
out
and
as
each
wave
came
she
gave
the
slightest
little
jump
so
that
it
seemed
it
was
the
wave
which
lifted
her
so
gently
i
believe
in
pretty
girls
having
a
good
time
said
harry
kember
why
not
do
you
make
a
mistake
my
dear
enjoy
and
suddenly
she
turned
turtle
disappeared
and
swam
away
quickly
quickly
like
a
rat
then
she
flicked
round
and
began
swimming
back
she
was
going
to
say
something
else
beryl
felt
that
she
was
being
poisoned
by
this
cold
woman
but
she
longed
to
hear
but
oh
how
strange
how
horrible
as
harry
kember
came
up
close
she
looked
in
her
black
waterproof
with
her
sleepy
face
lifted
above
the
water
just
her
chin
touching
like
a
horrible
caricature
of
her
husband
chapter
in
a
steamer
chair
under
a
manuka
tree
that
grew
in
the
middle
of
the
front
grass
patch
linda
burnell
dreamed
the
morning
away
she
did
nothing
she
looked
up
at
the
dark
close
dry
leaves
of
the
manuka
at
the
chinks
of
blue
between
and
now
and
again
a
tiny
yellowish
flower
dropped
on
her
pretty
yes
if
you
held
one
of
those
flowers
on
the
palm
of
your
hand
and
looked
at
it
closely
it
was
an
exquisite
small
thing
each
pale
yellow
petal
shone
as
if
each
was
the
careful
work
of
a
loving
hand
the
tiny
tongue
in
the
centre
gave
it
the
shape
of
a
bell
and
when
you
turned
it
over
the
outside
was
a
deep
bronze
colour
but
as
soon
as
they
flowered
they
fell
and
were
scattered
you
brushed
them
off
your
frock
as
you
talked
the
horrid
little
things
got
caught
in
one
hair
why
then
flower
at
all
who
takes
the
trouble
or
the
joy
to
make
all
these
things
that
are
wasted
wasted
it
was
uncanny
on
the
grass
beside
her
lying
between
two
pillows
was
the
boy
sound
asleep
he
lay
his
head
turned
away
from
his
mother
his
fine
dark
hair
looked
more
like
a
shadow
than
like
real
hair
but
his
ear
was
a
bright
deep
coral
linda
clasped
her
hands
above
her
head
and
crossed
her
feet
it
was
very
pleasant
to
know
that
all
these
bungalows
were
empty
that
everybody
was
down
on
the
beach
out
of
sight
out
of
hearing
she
had
the
garden
to
herself
she
was
alone
dazzling
white
the
picotees
shone
the
marigold
glittered
the
nasturtiums
wreathed
the
veranda
poles
in
green
and
gold
flame
if
only
one
had
time
to
look
at
these
flowers
long
enough
time
to
get
over
the
sense
of
novelty
and
strangeness
time
to
know
them
but
as
soon
as
one
paused
to
part
the
petals
to
discover
the
of
the
leaf
along
came
life
and
one
was
swept
away
and
lying
in
her
cane
chair
linda
felt
so
light
she
felt
like
a
leaf
along
came
life
like
a
wind
and
she
was
seized
and
shaken
she
had
to
go
oh
dear
would
it
always
be
so
was
there
no
escape
now
she
sat
on
the
veranda
of
their
tasmanian
home
leaning
against
her
father
knee
and
he
promised
as
soon
as
you
and
i
are
old
enough
linny
we
cut
off
somewhere
we
escape
two
boys
together
i
have
a
fancy
i
like
to
sail
up
a
river
in
linda
saw
that
river
very
wide
covered
with
little
rafts
and
boats
she
saw
the
yellow
hats
of
the
boatmen
and
she
heard
their
high
thin
voices
as
they
called
yes
but
just
then
a
very
broad
young
man
with
bright
ginger
hair
walked
slowly
past
their
house
and
slowly
solemnly
even
uncovered
father
pulled
her
ear
teasingly
in
the
way
he
had
linny
beau
he
whispered
oh
papa
fancy
being
married
to
stanley
burnell
well
she
was
married
to
him
and
what
was
more
she
loved
him
not
the
stanley
whom
every
one
saw
not
the
everyday
one
but
a
timid
sensitive
innocent
stanley
who
knelt
down
every
night
to
say
his
prayers
and
who
longed
to
be
good
stanley
was
simple
if
he
believed
in
people
as
he
believed
in
her
for
instance
it
was
with
his
whole
heart
he
could
not
be
disloyal
he
could
not
tell
a
lie
and
how
terribly
he
suffered
if
he
thought
any
one
she
was
not
being
dead
straight
dead
sincere
with
him
this
is
too
subtle
for
me
he
flung
out
the
words
but
his
open
quivering
distraught
look
was
like
the
look
of
a
trapped
beast
but
the
trouble
was
here
linda
felt
almost
inclined
to
laugh
though
heaven
knows
it
was
no
laughing
matter
she
saw
her
stanley
so
seldom
there
were
glimpses
moments
breathing
spaces
of
calm
but
all
the
rest
of
the
time
it
was
like
living
in
a
house
that
could
be
cured
of
the
habit
of
catching
on
fire
on
a
ship
that
got
wrecked
every
day
and
it
was
always
stanley
who
was
in
the
thick
of
the
danger
her
whole
time
was
spent
in
rescuing
him
and
restoring
him
and
calming
him
down
and
listening
to
his
story
and
what
was
left
of
her
time
was
spent
in
the
dread
of
having
children
linda
frowned
she
sat
up
quickly
in
her
steamer
chair
and
clasped
her
ankles
yes
that
was
her
real
grudge
against
life
that
was
what
she
could
not
understand
that
was
the
question
she
asked
and
asked
and
listened
in
vain
for
the
answer
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
it
was
the
common
lot
of
women
to
bear
children
it
was
true
she
for
one
could
prove
that
wrong
she
was
broken
made
weak
her
courage
was
gone
through
and
what
made
it
doubly
hard
to
bear
was
she
did
not
love
her
children
it
was
useless
pretending
even
if
she
had
had
the
strength
she
never
would
have
nursed
and
played
with
the
little
girls
no
it
was
as
though
a
cold
breath
had
chilled
her
through
and
through
on
each
of
those
awful
journeys
she
had
no
warmth
left
to
give
them
as
to
the
boy
well
thank
heaven
mother
had
taken
him
he
was
mother
or
beryl
or
anybody
who
wanted
him
she
had
hardly
held
him
in
her
arms
she
was
so
indifferent
about
him
that
as
he
lay
there
linda
glanced
down
the
boy
had
turned
over
he
lay
facing
her
and
he
was
no
longer
asleep
his
baby
eyes
were
open
he
looked
as
though
he
was
peeping
at
his
mother
and
suddenly
his
face
dimpled
it
broke
into
a
wide
toothless
smile
a
perfect
beam
no
less
i
here
that
happy
smile
seemed
to
say
why
do
you
like
me
there
was
something
so
quaint
so
unexpected
about
that
smile
that
linda
smiled
herself
but
she
checked
herself
and
said
to
the
boy
coldly
i
do
like
do
like
babies
the
boy
could
believe
her
do
like
me
he
waved
his
arms
foolishly
at
his
mother
linda
dropped
off
her
chair
on
to
the
grass
why
do
you
keep
on
smiling
she
said
severely
if
you
knew
what
i
was
thinking
about
you
but
he
only
squeezed
up
his
eyes
slyly
and
rolled
his
head
on
the
pillow
he
did
believe
a
word
she
said
we
know
all
about
that
smiled
the
boy
linda
was
so
astonished
at
the
confidence
of
this
little
creature
ah
no
be
sincere
that
was
not
what
she
felt
it
was
something
far
different
it
was
something
so
new
so
the
tears
danced
in
her
eyes
she
breathed
in
a
small
whisper
to
the
boy
hallo
my
funny
but
by
now
the
boy
had
forgotten
his
mother
he
was
serious
again
something
pink
something
soft
waved
in
front
of
him
he
made
a
grab
at
it
and
it
immediately
disappeared
but
when
he
lay
back
another
like
the
first
appeared
this
time
he
determined
to
catch
it
he
made
a
tremendous
effort
and
rolled
right
over
chapter
the
tide
was
out
the
beach
was
deserted
lazily
flopped
the
warm
sea
the
sun
beat
down
beat
down
hot
and
fiery
on
the
fine
sand
baking
the
grey
and
blue
and
black
and
pebbles
it
sucked
up
the
little
drop
of
water
that
lay
in
the
hollow
of
the
curved
shells
it
bleached
the
pink
convolvulus
that
threaded
through
and
through
the
nothing
seemed
to
move
but
the
small
they
were
never
still
over
there
on
the
rocks
that
looked
at
low
tide
like
shaggy
beasts
come
down
to
the
water
to
drink
the
sunlight
seemed
to
spin
like
a
silver
coin
dropped
into
each
of
the
small
rock
pools
they
danced
they
quivered
and
minute
ripples
laved
the
porous
shores
looking
down
bending
over
each
pool
was
like
a
lake
with
pink
and
blue
houses
clustered
on
the
shores
and
oh
the
vast
mountainous
country
behind
those
houses
the
ravines
the
passes
the
dangerous
creeks
and
fearful
tracks
that
led
to
the
water
edge
underneath
waved
the
pink
trees
velvet
anemones
and
orange
weeds
now
a
stone
on
the
bottom
moved
rocked
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
a
black
feeler
now
a
creature
wavered
by
and
was
lost
something
was
happening
to
the
pink
waving
trees
they
were
changing
to
a
cold
moonlight
blue
and
now
there
sounded
the
faintest
who
made
that
sound
what
was
going
on
down
there
and
how
strong
how
damp
the
seaweed
smelt
in
the
hot
sun
the
green
blinds
were
drawn
in
the
bungalows
of
the
summer
colony
over
the
verandas
prone
on
the
paddock
flung
over
the
fences
there
were
and
rough
striped
towels
each
back
window
seemed
to
have
a
pair
of
on
the
sill
and
some
lumps
of
rock
or
a
bucket
or
a
collection
of
pawa
shells
the
bush
quivered
in
a
haze
of
heat
the
sandy
road
was
empty
except
for
the
trouts
dog
snooker
who
lay
stretched
in
the
very
middle
of
it
his
blue
eye
was
turned
up
his
legs
stuck
out
stiffly
and
he
gave
an
occasional
puff
as
much
as
to
say
he
had
decided
to
make
an
end
of
it
and
was
only
waiting
for
some
kind
cart
to
come
along
what
are
you
looking
at
my
grandma
why
do
you
keep
stopping
and
sort
of
staring
at
the
wall
kezia
and
her
grandmother
were
taking
their
siesta
together
the
little
girl
wearing
only
her
short
drawers
and
her
her
arms
and
legs
bare
lay
on
one
of
the
pillows
of
her
grandma
bed
and
the
old
woman
in
a
white
ruffled
sat
in
a
rocker
at
the
window
with
a
long
piece
of
pink
knitting
in
her
lap
this
room
that
they
shared
like
the
other
rooms
of
the
bungalow
was
of
light
varnished
wood
and
the
floor
was
bare
the
furniture
was
of
the
shabbiest
the
simplest
the
for
instance
was
a
in
a
sprigged
muslin
petticoat
and
the
mirror
above
was
very
strange
it
was
as
though
a
little
piece
of
forked
lightning
was
imprisoned
in
it
on
the
table
there
stood
a
jar
of
pressed
so
tightly
together
they
looked
more
like
a
velvet
pincushion
and
a
special
shell
which
kezia
had
given
her
grandma
for
a
and
another
even
more
special
which
she
had
thought
would
make
a
very
nice
place
for
a
watch
to
curl
up
in
tell
me
grandma
said
kezia
the
old
woman
sighed
whipped
the
wool
twice
round
her
thumb
and
drew
the
bone
needle
through
she
was
casting
on
i
was
thinking
of
your
uncle
william
darling
she
said
quietly
my
australian
uncle
william
said
kezia
she
had
another
yes
of
the
one
i
never
saw
that
was
the
well
what
happened
to
him
kezia
knew
perfectly
well
but
she
wanted
to
be
told
again
he
went
to
the
mines
and
he
got
a
sunstroke
there
and
died
said
old
fairfield
kezia
blinked
and
considered
the
picture
again
a
little
man
fallen
over
like
a
tin
soldier
by
the
side
of
a
big
black
hole
does
it
make
you
sad
to
think
about
him
grandma
she
hated
her
grandma
to
be
sad
it
was
the
old
woman
turn
to
consider
did
it
make
her
sad
to
look
back
back
to
stare
down
the
years
as
kezia
had
seen
her
doing
to
look
after
them
as
a
woman
does
long
after
they
were
out
of
sight
did
it
make
her
sad
no
life
was
like
that
no
but
why
asked
kezia
she
lifted
one
bare
arm
and
began
to
draw
things
in
the
air
why
did
uncle
william
have
to
die
he
was
fairfield
began
counting
the
stitches
in
threes
it
just
happened
she
said
in
an
absorbed
voice
does
everybody
have
to
die
asked
kezia
everybody
me
kezia
sounded
fearfully
incredulous
some
day
my
but
kezia
waved
her
left
leg
and
waggled
the
toes
they
felt
sandy
what
if
i
just
wo
the
old
woman
sighed
again
and
drew
a
long
thread
from
the
ball
we
not
asked
kezia
she
said
sadly
it
happens
to
all
of
us
sooner
or
kezia
lay
still
thinking
this
over
she
did
want
to
die
it
meant
she
would
have
to
leave
here
leave
everywhere
for
ever
leave
leave
her
grandma
she
rolled
over
quickly
grandma
she
said
in
a
startled
voice
what
my
pet
you
not
to
kezia
was
very
decided
ah
kezia
her
grandma
looked
up
and
smiled
and
shook
her
head
let
talk
about
but
you
not
to
you
could
leave
me
you
could
not
be
this
was
awful
promise
me
you
wo
ever
do
it
grandma
pleaded
kezia
the
old
woman
went
on
knitting
promise
me
say
never
but
still
her
grandma
was
silent
kezia
rolled
off
her
bed
she
could
bear
it
any
longer
and
lightly
she
leapt
on
to
her
grandma
knees
clasped
her
hands
round
the
old
woman
throat
and
began
kissing
her
under
the
chin
behind
the
ear
and
blowing
down
her
neck
say
never
say
never
say
never
she
gasped
between
the
kisses
and
then
she
began
very
softly
and
lightly
to
tickle
her
grandma
kezia
the
old
woman
dropped
her
knitting
she
swung
back
in
the
rocker
she
began
to
tickle
kezia
say
never
say
never
say
never
gurgled
kezia
while
they
lay
there
laughing
in
each
other
arms
come
that
enough
my
squirrel
that
enough
my
wild
pony
said
old
fairfield
setting
her
cap
straight
pick
up
my
both
of
them
had
forgotten
what
the
never
was
about
chapter
the
sun
was
still
full
on
the
garden
when
the
back
door
of
the
shut
with
a
bang
and
a
very
gay
figure
walked
down
the
path
to
the
gate
it
was
alice
the
dressed
for
her
afternoon
out
she
wore
a
white
cotton
dress
with
such
large
red
spots
on
it
and
so
many
that
they
made
you
shudder
white
shoes
and
a
leghorn
turned
up
under
the
brim
with
poppies
of
course
she
wore
gloves
white
ones
stained
at
the
fastenings
with
and
in
one
hand
she
carried
a
very
sunshade
which
she
referred
to
as
her
beryl
sitting
in
the
window
fanning
her
hair
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
guy
if
alice
had
only
blacked
her
face
with
a
piece
of
cork
before
she
started
out
the
picture
would
have
been
complete
and
where
did
a
girl
like
that
go
to
in
a
place
like
this
the
fijian
fan
beat
scornfully
at
that
lovely
bright
mane
she
supposed
alice
had
picked
up
some
horrible
common
larrikin
and
go
off
into
the
bush
together
pity
to
have
made
herself
so
conspicuous
they
have
hard
work
to
hide
with
alice
in
that
but
no
beryl
was
unfair
alice
was
going
to
tea
with
mrs
stubbs
sent
her
an
invite
by
the
little
boy
who
called
for
orders
she
had
taken
ever
such
a
liking
to
stubbs
ever
since
the
first
time
she
went
to
the
shop
to
get
something
for
her
mosquitoes
dear
heart
stubbs
had
clapped
her
hand
to
her
side
i
never
seen
anyone
so
eaten
you
might
have
been
attacked
by
alice
did
wish
there
been
a
bit
of
life
on
the
road
though
made
her
feel
so
queer
having
nobody
behind
her
made
her
feel
all
weak
in
the
spine
she
could
believe
that
some
one
was
watching
her
and
yet
it
was
silly
to
turn
round
it
gave
you
away
she
pulled
up
her
gloves
hummed
to
herself
and
said
to
the
distant
sha
be
long
but
that
was
hardly
company
stubbs
shop
was
perched
on
a
little
hillock
just
off
the
road
it
had
two
big
windows
for
eyes
a
broad
veranda
for
a
hat
and
the
sign
on
the
roof
scrawled
stubbs
was
like
a
little
card
stuck
rakishly
in
the
hat
crown
on
the
veranda
there
hung
a
long
string
of
clinging
together
as
though
they
just
been
rescued
from
the
sea
rather
than
waiting
to
go
in
and
beside
them
there
hung
a
cluster
of
sandshoes
so
extraordinarily
mixed
that
to
get
at
one
pair
you
had
to
tear
apart
and
forcibly
separate
at
least
fifty
even
then
it
was
the
rarest
thing
to
find
the
left
that
belonged
to
the
right
so
many
people
had
lost
patience
and
gone
off
with
one
shoe
that
fitted
and
one
that
was
a
little
too
big
stubbs
prided
herself
on
keeping
something
of
everything
the
two
windows
arranged
in
the
form
of
precarious
pyramids
were
crammed
so
tight
piled
so
high
that
it
seemed
only
a
conjurer
could
prevent
them
from
toppling
over
in
the
corner
of
one
window
glued
to
the
pane
by
four
gelatine
lozenges
there
was
and
there
had
been
from
time
immemorial
a
notice

reward
offered
alice
pressed
open
the
door
the
bell
jangled
the
red
serge
curtains
parted
and
stubbs
appeared
with
her
broad
smile
and
the
long
bacon
knife
in
her
hand
she
looked
like
a
friendly
brigand
alice
was
welcomed
so
warmly
that
she
found
it
quite
difficult
to
keep
up
her
they
consisted
of
persistent
little
coughs
and
hems
pulls
at
her
gloves
tweaks
at
her
skirt
and
a
curious
difficulty
in
seeing
what
was
set
before
her
or
understanding
what
was
said
tea
was
laid
on
the
parlour
table
ham
sardines
a
whole
pound
of
butter
and
such
a
large
johnny
cake
that
it
looked
like
an
advertisement
for
somebody
but
the
primus
stove
roared
so
loudly
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
talk
above
it
alice
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
while
stubbs
pumped
the
stove
still
higher
suddenly
stubbs
whipped
the
cushion
off
a
chair
and
disclosed
a
large
parcel
i
just
had
some
new
photers
taken
my
dear
she
shouted
cheerfully
to
alice
tell
me
what
you
think
of
in
a
very
dainty
refined
way
alice
wet
her
finger
and
put
the
tissue
back
from
the
first
one
life
how
many
there
were
there
were
three
dozzing
at
least
and
she
held
it
up
to
the
light
stubbs
sat
in
an
leaning
very
much
to
one
side
there
was
a
look
of
mild
astonishment
on
her
large
face
and
well
there
might
be
for
though
the
stood
on
a
carpet
to
the
left
of
it
miraculously
skirting
the
there
was
a
dashing
on
her
right
stood
a
grecian
pillar
with
a
giant
on
either
side
of
it
and
in
the
background
towered
a
gaunt
mountain
pale
with
snow
it
is
a
nice
style
is
it
shouted
stubbs
and
alice
had
just
screamed
sweetly
when
the
roaring
of
the
primus
stove
died
down
fizzled
out
ceased
and
she
said
pretty
in
a
silence
that
was
frightening
draw
up
your
chair
my
dear
said
stubbs
beginning
to
pour
out
yes
she
said
thoughtfully
as
she
handed
the
tea
but
i
do
care
about
the
size
i
having
an
enlargemint
all
very
well
for
christmas
cards
but
i
never
was
the
one
for
small
photers
myself
you
get
no
comfort
out
of
them
to
say
the
truth
i
find
them
alice
quite
saw
what
she
meant
size
said
stubbs
give
me
size
that
was
what
my
poor
dear
husband
was
always
saying
he
could
stand
anything
small
gave
him
the
creeps
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
my
dear
here
stubbs
creaked
and
seemed
to
expand
herself
at
the
memory
it
was
dropsy
that
carried
him
off
at
the
larst
many
the
time
they
drawn
one
and
a
half
pints
from
at
the
it
seemed
like
a
alice
burned
to
know
exactly
what
it
was
that
was
drawn
from
him
she
ventured
i
suppose
it
was
but
stubbs
fixed
alice
with
her
eyes
and
replied
meaningly
it
was
liquid
my
liquid
alice
jumped
away
from
the
word
like
a
cat
and
came
back
to
it
nosing
and
wary
that
said
stubbs
and
she
pointed
dramatically
to
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
burly
man
with
a
dead
white
rose
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
coat
that
made
you
think
of
a
curl
of
cold
mutting
fat
just
below
in
silver
letters
on
a
red
cardboard
ground
were
the
words
be
not
afraid
it
is
it
ever
such
a
fine
face
said
alice
faintly
the
bow
on
the
top
of
stubbs
fair
frizzy
hair
quivered
she
arched
her
plump
neck
what
a
neck
she
had
it
was
bright
pink
where
it
began
and
then
it
changed
to
warm
apricot
and
that
faded
to
the
colour
of
a
brown
egg
and
then
to
a
deep
creamy
all
the
same
my
dear
she
said
surprisingly
freedom
best
her
soft
fat
chuckle
sounded
like
a
purr
freedom
best
said
stubbs
again
freedom
alice
gave
a
loud
silly
little
titter
she
felt
awkward
her
mind
flew
back
to
her
own
kitching
ever
so
queer
she
wanted
to
be
back
in
it
again
chapter
a
strange
company
assembled
in
the
burnells
washhouse
after
tea
round
the
table
there
sat
a
bull
a
rooster
a
donkey
that
kept
forgetting
it
was
a
donkey
a
sheep
and
a
bee
the
washhouse
was
the
perfect
place
for
such
a
meeting
because
they
could
make
as
much
noise
as
they
liked
and
nobody
ever
interrupted
it
was
a
small
tin
shed
standing
apart
from
the
bungalow
against
the
wall
there
was
a
deep
trough
and
in
the
corner
a
copper
with
a
basket
of
on
top
of
it
the
little
window
spun
over
with
cobwebs
had
a
piece
of
candle
and
a
on
the
dusty
sill
there
were
clotheslines
overhead
and
hanging
from
a
peg
on
the
wall
a
very
big
a
huge
rusty
horseshoe
the
table
was
in
the
middle
with
a
form
at
either
side
you
ca
be
a
bee
kezia
a
bee
not
an
animal
it
a
oh
but
i
do
want
to
be
a
bee
frightfully
wailed
kezia
a
tiny
bee
all
with
striped
legs
she
drew
her
legs
up
under
her
and
leaned
over
the
table
she
felt
she
was
a
bee
a
ninseck
must
be
an
animal
she
said
stoutly
it
makes
a
noise
not
like
a
i
a
bull
i
a
bull
cried
pip
and
he
gave
such
a
tremendous
bellow
how
did
he
make
that
noise
that
lottie
looked
quite
alarmed
i
be
a
sheep
said
little
rags
a
whole
lot
of
sheep
went
past
this
how
do
you
know
dad
heard
them
baa
he
sounded
like
the
little
lamb
that
trots
behind
and
seems
to
wait
to
be
carried
shrilled
isabel
with
her
red
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
she
looked
like
a
rooster
what
i
be
lottie
asked
everybody
and
she
sat
there
smiling
waiting
for
them
to
decide
for
her
it
had
to
be
an
easy
one
be
a
donkey
it
was
kezia
suggestion
you
forget
said
lottie
solemnly
when
do
i
have
to
say
it
i
explain
i
explain
said
the
bull
it
was
he
who
had
the
cards
he
waved
them
round
his
head
all
be
quiet
all
listen
and
he
waited
for
them
look
here
he
turned
up
a
card
it
got
two
spots
on
it
see
now
if
you
put
that
card
in
the
middle
and
somebody
else
has
one
with
two
spots
as
well
you
say
and
the
mine
lottie
was
to
keep
no
silly
just
for
the
game
see
just
while
we
the
bull
was
very
cross
with
her
oh
lottie
you
are
a
little
silly
said
the
proud
rooster
lottie
looked
at
both
of
them
then
she
hung
her
head
her
lip
quivered
i
do
want
to
play
she
whispered
the
others
glanced
at
one
another
like
conspirators
all
of
them
knew
what
that
meant
she
would
go
away
and
be
discovered
somewhere
standing
with
her
pinny
thrown
over
her
head
in
a
corner
or
against
a
wall
or
even
behind
a
chair
yes
you
do
lottie
it
quite
easy
said
kezia
and
isabel
repentant
said
exactly
like
a
watch
me
lottie
and
you
soon
cheer
up
lot
said
pip
there
i
know
what
i
do
i
give
you
the
first
one
it
mine
really
but
i
give
it
to
you
here
you
and
he
slammed
the
card
down
in
front
of
lottie
lottie
revived
at
that
but
now
she
was
in
another
difficulty
i
have
got
a
hanky
she
said
i
want
one
badly
here
lottie
you
can
use
rags
dipped
into
his
sailor
blouse
and
brought
up
a
very
one
knotted
together
be
very
careful
he
warned
her
only
use
that
corner
do
undo
it
i
got
a
little
starfish
inside
i
going
to
try
and
oh
come
on
you
girls
said
the
bull
and
mind
you
not
to
look
at
your
cards
you
got
to
keep
your
hands
under
the
table
till
i
say
smack
went
the
cards
round
the
table
they
tried
with
all
their
might
to
see
but
pip
was
too
quick
for
them
it
was
very
exciting
sitting
there
in
the
washhouse
it
was
all
they
could
do
not
to
burst
into
a
little
chorus
of
animals
before
pip
had
finished
dealing
now
lottie
you
timidly
lottie
stretched
out
a
hand
took
the
top
card
off
her
pack
had
a
good
look
at
it
it
was
plain
she
was
counting
the
spots
and
put
it
down
no
lottie
you
ca
do
that
you
must
look
first
you
must
turn
it
the
other
way
but
then
everybody
will
see
it
the
same
time
as
me
said
lottie
the
game
proceeded
the
bull
was
terrible
he
charged
over
the
table
and
seemed
to
eat
the
cards
up
said
the
bee
isabel
stood
up
in
her
excitement
and
moved
her
elbows
like
wings
baa
little
rags
put
down
the
king
of
diamonds
and
lottie
put
down
the
one
they
called
the
king
of
spain
she
had
hardly
any
cards
left
why
do
you
call
out
lottie
i
forgotten
what
i
am
said
the
donkey
woefully
well
change
be
a
dog
instead
oh
yes
that
much
lottie
smiled
again
but
when
she
and
kezia
both
had
a
one
kezia
waited
on
purpose
the
others
made
signs
to
lottie
and
pointed
lottie
turned
very
red
she
looked
bewildered
and
at
last
she
said
ss
wait
a
minute
they
were
in
the
very
thick
of
it
when
the
bull
stopped
them
holding
up
his
hand
what
that
what
that
noise
what
noise
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
rooster
ss
shut
up
listen
they
were
i
thought
i
heard
a
a
sort
of
knocking
said
the
bull
what
was
it
like
asked
the
sheep
faintly
no
answer
the
bee
gave
a
shudder
whatever
did
we
shut
the
door
for
she
said
softly
oh
why
why
had
they
shut
the
door
while
they
were
playing
the
day
had
faded
the
gorgeous
sunset
had
blazed
and
died
and
now
the
quick
dark
came
racing
over
the
sea
over
the
up
the
paddock
you
were
frightened
to
look
in
the
corners
of
the
washhouse
and
yet
you
had
to
look
with
all
your
might
and
somewhere
far
away
grandma
was
lighting
a
lamp
the
blinds
were
being
pulled
down
the
kitchen
fire
leapt
in
the
tins
on
the
mantelpiece
it
would
be
awful
now
said
the
bull
if
a
spider
was
to
fall
from
the
ceiling
on
to
the
table
would
it
spiders
do
fall
from
yes
they
do
our
min
told
us
she
seen
a
spider
as
big
as
a
saucer
with
long
hairs
on
it
like
a
quickly
all
the
little
heads
were
jerked
up
all
the
little
bodies
drew
together
pressed
together
why
does
somebody
come
and
call
us
cried
the
rooster
oh
those
laughing
and
snug
sitting
in
the
drinking
out
of
cups
they
forgotten
about
them
no
not
really
forgotten
that
was
what
their
smile
meant
they
had
decided
to
leave
them
there
all
by
themselves
suddenly
lottie
gave
such
a
piercing
scream
that
all
of
them
jumped
off
the
forms
all
of
them
screamed
too
a
face
a
face
looking
shrieked
lottie
it
was
true
it
was
real
pressed
against
the
window
was
a
pale
face
black
eyes
a
black
beard
grandma
mother
somebody
but
they
had
not
got
to
the
door
tumbling
over
one
another
before
it
opened
for
uncle
jonathan
he
had
come
to
take
the
little
boys
home
chapter
he
had
meant
to
be
there
before
but
in
the
front
garden
he
had
come
upon
linda
walking
up
and
down
the
grass
stopping
to
pick
off
a
dead
pink
or
give
a
carnation
something
to
lean
against
or
to
take
a
deep
breath
of
something
and
then
walking
on
again
with
her
little
air
of
remoteness
over
her
white
frock
she
wore
a
yellow
shawl
from
the
chinaman
shop
hallo
jonathan
called
linda
and
jonathan
whipped
off
his
shabby
panama
pressed
it
against
his
breast
dropped
on
one
knee
and
kissed
linda
hand
greeting
my
fair
one
greeting
my
celestial
peach
blossom
boomed
the
bass
voice
gently
where
are
the
other
noble
dames
beryl
out
playing
bridge
and
mother
giving
the
boy
his
bath
have
you
come
to
borrow
something
the
trouts
were
for
ever
running
out
of
things
and
sending
across
to
the
burnells
at
the
last
moment
but
jonathan
only
answered
a
little
love
a
little
kindness
and
he
walked
by
his
side
linda
dropped
into
beryl
hammock
under
the
and
jonathan
stretched
himself
on
the
grass
beside
her
pulled
a
long
stalk
and
began
chewing
it
they
knew
each
other
well
the
voices
of
children
cried
from
the
other
gardens
a
fisherman
light
cart
shook
along
the
sandy
road
and
from
far
away
they
heard
a
dog
barking
it
was
muffled
as
though
the
dog
had
its
head
in
a
sack
if
you
listened
you
could
just
hear
the
soft
swish
of
the
sea
at
full
tide
sweeping
the
pebbles
the
sun
was
sinking
and
so
you
go
back
to
the
office
on
monday
do
you
jonathan
asked
linda
on
monday
the
cage
door
opens
and
clangs
to
upon
the
victim
for
another
eleven
months
and
a
week
answered
jonathan
linda
swung
a
little
it
must
be
awful
she
said
slowly
would
ye
have
me
laugh
my
fair
sister
would
ye
have
me
weep
linda
was
so
accustomed
to
jonathan
way
of
talking
that
she
paid
no
attention
to
it
i
suppose
she
said
vaguely
one
gets
used
to
it
one
gets
used
to
does
one
hum
the
hum
was
so
deep
it
seemed
to
boom
from
underneath
the
ground
i
wonder
how
it
done
brooded
jonathan
i
never
managed
looking
at
him
as
he
lay
there
linda
thought
again
how
attractive
he
was
it
was
strange
to
think
that
he
was
only
an
ordinary
clerk
that
stanley
earned
twice
as
much
money
as
he
what
was
the
matter
with
jonathan
he
had
no
ambition
she
supposed
that
was
it
and
yet
one
felt
he
was
gifted
exceptional
he
was
passionately
fond
of
music
every
spare
penny
he
had
went
on
books
he
was
always
full
of
new
ideas
schemes
plans
but
nothing
came
of
it
all
the
new
fire
blazed
in
jonathan
you
almost
heard
it
roaring
softly
as
he
explained
described
and
dilated
on
the
new
thing
but
a
moment
later
it
had
fallen
in
and
there
was
nothing
but
ashes
and
jonathan
went
about
with
a
look
like
hunger
in
his
black
eyes
at
these
times
he
exaggerated
his
absurd
manner
of
speaking
and
he
sang
in
church
he
was
the
leader
of
the
choir
with
such
fearful
dramatic
intensity
that
the
meanest
hymn
put
on
an
unholy
splendour
it
seems
to
me
just
as
imbecile
just
as
infernal
to
have
to
go
to
the
office
on
monday
said
jonathan
as
it
always
has
done
and
always
will
do
to
spend
all
the
best
years
of
one
life
sitting
on
a
stool
from
nine
to
five
scratching
in
somebody
ledger
it
a
queer
use
to
make
of
one
one
and
only
life
is
it
or
do
i
fondly
dream
he
rolled
over
on
the
grass
and
looked
up
at
linda
tell
me
what
is
the
difference
between
my
life
and
that
of
an
ordinary
prisoner
the
only
difference
i
can
see
is
that
i
put
myself
in
jail
and
nobody
ever
going
to
let
me
out
that
a
more
intolerable
situation
than
the
other
for
if
i
been
pushed
in
against
my
will
kicking
even
once
the
door
was
locked
or
at
any
rate
in
five
years
or
so
i
might
have
accepted
the
fact
and
begun
to
take
an
interest
in
the
flight
of
flies
or
counting
the
warder
steps
along
the
passage
with
particular
attention
to
variations
of
tread
and
so
on
but
as
it
is
i
like
an
insect
that
flown
into
a
room
of
its
own
accord
i
dash
against
the
walls
dash
against
the
windows
flop
against
the
ceiling
do
everything
on
god
earth
in
fact
except
fly
out
again
and
all
the
while
thinking
like
that
moth
or
that
butterfly
or
whatever
it
is
shortness
of
life
the
shortness
of
life
i
only
one
night
or
one
day
and
there
this
vast
dangerous
garden
waiting
out
there
undiscovered
but
if
you
feel
like
that
why
began
linda
quickly
ah
cried
jonathan
and
that
ah
was
somehow
almost
exultant
there
you
have
me
why
why
indeed
there
the
maddening
mysterious
question
why
do
i
fly
out
again
there
the
window
or
the
door
or
whatever
it
was
i
came
in
by
it
not
hopelessly
shut
is
it
why
i
find
it
and
be
off
answer
me
that
little
but
he
gave
her
no
time
to
answer
i
exactly
like
that
insect
again
for
some
reason
jonathan
paused
between
the
words
it
not
allowed
it
forbidden
it
against
the
insect
law
to
stop
banging
and
flopping
and
crawling
up
the
pane
even
for
an
instant
why
do
i
leave
the
office
why
do
i
seriously
consider
this
moment
for
instance
what
it
is
that
prevents
me
leaving
it
not
as
though
i
tremendously
tied
i
two
boys
to
provide
for
but
after
all
they
boys
i
could
cut
off
to
sea
or
get
a
job
or
suddenly
he
smiled
at
linda
and
said
in
a
changed
voice
as
if
he
were
confiding
a
secret
weak
weak
no
stamina
no
anchor
no
guiding
principle
let
us
call
but
then
the
dark
velvety
voice
rolled
out
would
ye
hear
the
story
how
it
unfolds
itself
and
they
were
silent
the
sun
had
set
in
the
western
sky
there
were
great
masses
of
clouds
broad
beams
of
light
shone
through
the
clouds
and
beyond
them
as
if
they
would
cover
the
whole
sky
overhead
the
blue
faded
it
turned
a
pale
gold
and
the
bush
outlined
against
it
gleamed
dark
and
brilliant
like
metal
sometimes
when
those
beams
of
light
show
in
the
sky
they
are
very
awful
they
remind
you
that
up
there
sits
jehovah
the
jealous
god
the
almighty
whose
eye
is
upon
you
ever
watchful
never
weary
you
remember
that
at
his
coming
the
whole
earth
will
shake
into
one
ruined
graveyard
the
cold
bright
angels
will
drive
you
this
way
and
that
and
there
will
be
no
time
to
explain
what
could
be
explained
so
simply
but
it
seemed
to
linda
there
was
something
infinitely
joyful
and
loving
in
those
silver
beams
and
now
no
sound
came
from
the
sea
it
breathed
softly
as
if
it
would
draw
that
tender
joyful
beauty
into
its
own
bosom
it
all
wrong
it
all
wrong
came
the
shadowy
voice
of
jonathan
it
not
the
scene
it
not
the
setting
for
three
stools
three
desks
three
inkpots
and
a
wire
linda
knew
that
he
would
never
change
but
she
said
is
it
too
late
even
now
i
old
i
old
intoned
jonathan
he
bent
towards
her
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
head
look
his
black
hair
was
speckled
all
over
with
silver
like
the
breast
plumage
of
a
black
fowl
linda
was
surprised
she
had
no
idea
that
he
was
grey
and
yet
as
he
stood
up
beside
her
and
sighed
and
stretched
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
not
resolute
not
gallant
not
careless
but
touched
already
with
age
he
looked
very
tall
on
the
darkening
grass
and
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
he
is
like
a
jonathan
stooped
again
and
kissed
her
fingers
heaven
reward
thy
sweet
patience
lady
mine
he
murmured
i
must
go
seek
those
heirs
to
my
fame
and
fortune
he
was
gone
chapter
light
shone
in
the
windows
of
the
bungalow
two
square
patches
of
gold
fell
upon
the
pinks
and
the
peaked
marigolds
florrie
the
cat
came
out
on
to
the
veranda
and
sat
on
the
top
step
her
white
paws
close
together
her
tail
curled
round
she
looked
content
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
moment
all
day
thank
goodness
it
getting
late
said
florrie
thank
goodness
the
long
day
is
her
greengage
eyes
opened
presently
there
sounded
the
rumble
of
the
coach
the
crack
of
whip
it
came
near
enough
for
one
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
men
from
town
talking
loudly
together
it
stopped
at
the
burnells
gate
stanley
was
up
the
path
before
he
saw
linda
is
that
you
darling
yes
he
leapt
across
the
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
she
was
enfolded
in
that
familiar
eager
strong
embrace
forgive
me
darling
forgive
me
stammered
stanley
and
he
put
his
hand
under
her
chin
and
lifted
her
face
to
him
forgive
you
smiled
linda
but
whatever
for
good
god
you
ca
have
forgotten
cried
stanley
burnell
thought
of
nothing
else
all
day
i
had
the
hell
of
a
day
i
made
up
my
mind
to
dash
out
and
telegraph
and
then
i
thought
the
wire
reach
you
before
i
did
i
been
in
tortures
but
stanley
said
linda
what
must
i
forgive
you
for
linda
stanley
was
very
hurt
did
you
realize
you
must
have
realized
i
went
away
without
saying
to
you
this
morning
i
ca
imagine
how
i
can
have
done
such
a
thing
my
confounded
temper
of
course
but
well
and
he
sighed
and
took
her
in
his
arms
again
suffered
for
it
enough
what
that
you
got
in
your
hand
asked
linda
new
gloves
let
me
oh
just
a
cheap
pair
of
ones
said
stanley
humbly
i
noticed
bell
was
wearing
some
in
the
coach
this
morning
so
as
i
was
passing
the
shop
i
dashed
in
and
got
myself
a
pair
what
are
you
smiling
at
you
do
think
it
was
wrong
of
me
do
you
on
the
darling
said
linda
i
think
it
was
most
she
pulled
one
of
the
large
pale
gloves
on
her
own
fingers
and
looked
at
her
hand
turning
it
this
way
and
that
she
was
still
smiling
stanley
wanted
to
say
i
was
thinking
of
you
the
whole
time
i
bought
it
was
true
but
for
some
reason
he
could
say
it
let
go
in
said
he
chapter
why
does
one
feel
so
different
at
night
why
is
it
so
exciting
to
be
awake
when
everybody
else
is
asleep
late
it
is
very
late
and
yet
every
moment
you
feel
more
and
more
wakeful
as
though
you
were
slowly
almost
with
every
breath
waking
up
into
a
new
wonderful
far
more
thrilling
and
exciting
world
than
the
daylight
one
and
what
is
this
queer
sensation
that
you
a
conspirator
lightly
stealthily
you
move
about
your
room
you
take
something
off
the
and
put
it
down
again
without
a
sound
and
everything
even
the
knows
you
responds
shares
your
secret
you
not
very
fond
of
your
room
by
day
you
never
think
about
it
you
in
and
out
the
door
opens
and
slams
the
cupboard
creaks
you
sit
down
on
the
side
of
your
bed
change
your
shoes
and
dash
out
again
a
dive
down
to
the
glass
two
pins
in
your
hair
powder
your
nose
and
off
again
but
now
it
suddenly
dear
to
you
it
a
darling
little
funny
room
it
yours
oh
what
a
joy
it
is
to
own
things
mine
my
own
my
very
own
for
ever
their
lips
met
no
of
course
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
was
all
nonsense
and
rubbish
but
in
spite
of
herself
beryl
saw
so
plainly
two
people
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
room
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
he
held
her
and
now
he
whispered
my
beauty
my
little
beauty
she
jumped
off
her
bed
ran
over
to
the
window
and
kneeled
on
the
with
her
elbows
on
the
sill
but
the
beautiful
night
the
garden
every
bush
every
leaf
even
the
white
palings
even
the
stars
were
conspirators
too
so
bright
was
the
moon
that
the
flowers
were
bright
as
by
day
the
shadow
of
the
nasturtiums
exquisite
leaves
and
flowers
lay
across
the
silvery
veranda
the
bent
by
the
southerly
winds
was
like
a
bird
on
one
leg
stretching
out
a
wing
but
when
beryl
looked
at
the
bush
it
seemed
to
her
the
bush
was
sad
we
are
dumb
trees
reaching
up
in
the
night
imploring
we
know
not
what
said
the
sorrowful
bush
it
is
true
when
you
are
by
yourself
and
you
think
about
life
it
is
always
sad
all
that
excitement
and
so
on
has
a
way
of
suddenly
leaving
you
and
it
as
though
in
the
silence
somebody
called
your
name
and
you
heard
your
name
for
the
first
time
beryl
yes
i
here
i
beryl
who
wants
me
beryl
let
me
it
is
lonely
living
by
oneself
of
course
there
are
relations
friends
heaps
of
them
but
that
not
what
she
means
she
wants
some
one
who
will
find
the
beryl
they
none
of
them
know
who
will
expect
her
to
be
that
beryl
always
she
wants
a
lover
take
me
away
from
all
these
other
people
my
love
let
us
go
far
away
let
us
live
our
life
all
new
all
ours
from
the
very
beginning
let
us
make
our
fire
let
us
sit
down
to
eat
together
let
us
have
long
talks
at
and
the
thought
was
almost
save
me
my
love
save
me
oh
go
on
do
be
a
prude
my
dear
you
enjoy
yourself
while
you
young
that
my
and
a
high
rush
of
silly
laughter
joined
harry
kember
loud
indifferent
neigh
you
see
it
so
frightfully
difficult
when
you
nobody
you
so
at
the
mercy
of
things
you
ca
just
be
rude
and
you
always
this
horror
of
seeming
inexperienced
and
stuffy
like
the
other
ninnies
at
the
bay
and
and
it
fascinating
to
know
you
power
over
people
yes
that
is
fascinating
oh
why
oh
why
does
he
come
soon
if
i
go
on
living
here
thought
beryl
anything
may
happen
to
me
but
how
do
you
know
he
is
coming
at
all
mocked
a
small
voice
within
her
but
beryl
dismissed
it
she
could
be
left
other
people
perhaps
but
not
she
it
was
possible
to
think
that
beryl
fairfield
never
married
that
lovely
fascinating
girl
do
you
remember
beryl
fairfield
remember
her
as
if
i
could
forget
her
it
was
one
summer
at
the
bay
that
i
saw
her
she
was
standing
on
the
beach
in
a
blue
no
pink
muslin
frock
holding
on
a
big
cream
no
black
straw
hat
but
it
years
ago
she
as
lovely
as
ever
more
so
if
beryl
smiled
bit
her
lip
and
gazed
over
the
garden
as
she
gazed
she
saw
somebody
a
man
leave
the
road
step
along
the
paddock
beside
their
palings
as
if
he
was
coming
straight
towards
her
her
heart
beat
who
was
it
who
could
it
be
it
could
be
a
burglar
certainly
not
a
burglar
for
he
was
smoking
and
he
strolled
lightly
beryl
heart
leapt
it
seemed
to
turn
right
over
and
then
to
stop
she
recognized
him
good
evening
miss
beryl
said
the
voice
softly
good
wo
you
come
for
a
little
walk
it
drawled
come
for
a
walk
at
that
time
of
night
i
could
everybody
in
bed
everybody
oh
said
the
voice
lightly
and
a
whiff
of
sweet
smoke
reached
her
what
does
everybody
matter
do
come
it
such
a
fine
night
not
a
soul
beryl
shook
her
head
but
already
something
stirred
in
her
something
reared
its
head
the
voice
said
frightened
it
mocked
poor
little
girl
not
in
the
least
said
she
as
she
spoke
that
weak
thing
within
her
seemed
to
uncoil
to
grow
suddenly
tremendously
strong
she
longed
to
go
and
just
as
if
this
was
quite
understood
by
the
other
the
voice
said
gently
and
softly
but
finally
come
along
beryl
stepped
over
her
low
window
crossed
the
veranda
ran
down
the
grass
to
the
gate
he
was
there
before
her
that
right
breathed
the
voice
and
it
teased
you
not
frightened
are
you
you
not
frightened
she
was
now
she
was
here
she
was
terrified
and
it
seemed
to
her
everything
was
different
the
moonlight
stared
and
glittered
the
shadows
were
like
bars
of
iron
her
hand
was
taken
not
in
the
least
she
said
lightly
why
should
i
be
her
hand
was
pulled
gently
tugged
she
held
back
no
i
not
coming
any
farther
said
beryl
oh
rot
harry
kember
did
believe
her
come
along
we
just
go
as
far
as
that
fuchsia
bush
come
along
the
fuchsia
bush
was
tall
it
fell
over
the
fence
in
a
shower
there
was
a
little
pit
of
darkness
beneath
no
really
i
do
want
to
said
beryl
for
a
moment
harry
kember
did
answer
then
he
came
close
to
her
turned
to
her
smiled
and
said
quickly
do
be
silly
do
be
silly
his
smile
was
something
she
never
seen
before
was
he
drunk
that
bright
blind
terrifying
smile
froze
her
with
horror
what
was
she
doing
how
had
she
got
here
the
stern
garden
asked
her
as
the
gate
pushed
open
and
quick
as
a
cat
harry
kember
came
through
and
snatched
her
to
him
cold
little
devil
cold
little
devil
said
the
hateful
voice
but
beryl
was
strong
she
slipped
ducked
wrenched
free
you
are
vile
vile
said
she
then
why
in
god
name
did
you
come
stammered
harry
kember
nobody
answered
him
chapter
a
cloud
small
serene
floated
across
the
moon
in
that
moment
of
darkness
the
sea
sounded
deep
troubled
then
the
cloud
sailed
away
and
the
sound
of
the
sea
was
a
vague
murmur
as
though
it
waked
out
of
a
dark
dream
all
was
still
the
garden
party
and
after
all
the
weather
was
ideal
they
could
not
have
had
a
more
perfect
day
for
a
if
they
had
ordered
it
windless
warm
the
sky
without
a
cloud
only
the
blue
was
veiled
with
a
haze
of
light
gold
as
it
is
sometimes
in
early
summer
the
gardener
had
been
up
since
dawn
mowing
the
lawns
and
sweeping
them
until
the
grass
and
the
dark
flat
rosettes
where
the
daisy
plants
had
been
seemed
to
shine
as
for
the
roses
you
could
not
help
feeling
they
understood
that
roses
are
the
only
flowers
that
impress
people
at
the
only
flowers
that
everybody
is
certain
of
knowing
hundreds
yes
literally
hundreds
had
come
out
in
a
single
night
the
green
bushes
bowed
down
as
though
they
had
been
visited
by
archangels
breakfast
was
not
yet
over
before
the
men
came
to
put
up
the
marquee
where
do
you
want
the
marquee
put
mother
my
dear
child
it
no
use
asking
me
i
determined
to
leave
everything
to
you
children
this
year
forget
i
am
your
mother
treat
me
as
an
honoured
but
meg
could
not
possibly
go
and
supervise
the
men
she
had
washed
her
hair
before
breakfast
and
she
sat
drinking
her
coffee
in
a
green
turban
with
a
dark
wet
curl
stamped
on
each
cheek
jose
the
butterfly
always
came
down
in
a
silk
petticoat
and
a
kimono
jacket
you
have
to
go
laura
you
the
artistic
away
laura
flew
still
holding
her
piece
of
it
so
delicious
to
have
an
excuse
for
eating
out
of
doors
and
besides
she
loved
having
to
arrange
things
she
always
felt
she
could
do
it
so
much
better
than
anybody
else
four
men
in
their
stood
grouped
together
on
the
garden
path
they
carried
staves
covered
with
rolls
of
canvas
and
they
had
big
slung
on
their
backs
they
looked
impressive
laura
wished
now
that
she
had
not
got
the
but
there
was
nowhere
to
put
it
and
she
could
possibly
throw
it
away
she
blushed
and
tried
to
look
severe
and
even
a
little
bit
as
she
came
up
to
them
good
morning
she
said
copying
her
mother
voice
but
that
sounded
so
fearfully
affected
that
she
was
ashamed
and
stammered
like
a
little
girl
oh
er
have
you
come
is
it
about
the
marquee
that
right
miss
said
the
tallest
of
the
men
a
lanky
freckled
fellow
and
he
shifted
his
knocked
back
his
straw
hat
and
smiled
down
at
her
that
about
his
smile
was
so
easy
so
friendly
that
laura
recovered
what
nice
eyes
he
had
small
but
such
a
dark
blue
and
now
she
looked
at
the
others
they
were
smiling
too
cheer
up
we
wo
bite
their
smile
seemed
to
say
how
very
nice
workmen
were
and
what
a
beautiful
morning
she
must
mention
the
morning
she
must
be
the
marquee
well
what
about
the
would
that
do
and
she
pointed
to
the
with
the
hand
that
did
hold
the
they
turned
they
stared
in
the
direction
a
little
fat
chap
thrust
out
his
and
the
tall
fellow
frowned
i
do
fancy
it
said
he
not
conspicuous
enough
you
see
with
a
thing
like
a
marquee
and
he
turned
to
laura
in
his
easy
way
you
want
to
put
it
somewhere
where
it
give
you
a
bang
slap
in
the
eye
if
you
follow
laura
upbringing
made
her
wonder
for
a
moment
whether
it
was
quite
respectful
of
a
workman
to
talk
to
her
of
bangs
slap
in
the
eye
but
she
did
quite
follow
him
a
corner
of
the
she
suggested
but
the
band
going
to
be
in
one
h
going
to
have
a
band
are
you
said
another
of
the
workmen
he
was
pale
he
had
a
haggard
look
as
his
dark
eyes
scanned
the
what
was
he
thinking
only
a
very
small
band
said
laura
gently
perhaps
he
would
mind
so
much
if
the
band
was
quite
small
but
the
tall
fellow
interrupted
look
here
miss
that
the
place
against
those
trees
over
there
that
do
against
the
karakas
then
the
would
be
hidden
and
they
were
so
lovely
with
their
broad
gleaming
leaves
and
their
clusters
of
yellow
fruit
they
were
like
trees
you
imagined
growing
on
a
desert
island
proud
solitary
lifting
their
leaves
and
fruits
to
the
sun
in
a
kind
of
silent
splendour
must
they
be
hidden
by
a
marquee
they
must
already
the
men
had
shouldered
their
staves
and
were
making
for
the
place
only
the
tall
fellow
was
left
he
bent
down
pinched
a
sprig
of
lavender
put
his
thumb
and
forefinger
to
his
nose
and
snuffed
up
the
smell
when
laura
saw
that
gesture
she
forgot
all
about
the
karakas
in
her
wonder
at
him
caring
for
things
like
that
caring
for
the
smell
of
lavender
how
many
men
that
she
knew
would
have
done
such
a
thing
oh
how
extraordinarily
nice
workmen
were
she
thought
why
could
she
have
workmen
for
her
friends
rather
than
the
silly
boys
she
danced
with
and
who
came
to
sunday
night
supper
she
would
get
on
much
better
with
men
like
these
it
all
the
fault
she
decided
as
the
tall
fellow
drew
something
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
something
that
was
to
be
looped
up
or
left
to
hang
of
these
absurd
class
distinctions
well
for
her
part
she
feel
them
not
a
bit
not
an
atom
and
now
there
came
the
of
wooden
hammers
some
one
whistled
some
one
sang
out
are
you
right
there
matey
matey
the
friendliness
of
it
the
the
just
to
prove
how
happy
she
was
just
to
show
the
tall
fellow
how
at
home
she
felt
and
how
she
despised
stupid
conventions
laura
took
a
big
bite
of
her
as
she
stared
at
the
little
drawing
she
felt
just
like
a
laura
laura
where
are
you
telephone
laura
a
voice
cried
from
the
house
coming
away
she
skimmed
over
the
lawn
up
the
path
up
the
steps
across
the
veranda
and
into
the
porch
in
the
hall
her
father
and
laurie
were
brushing
their
hats
ready
to
go
to
the
office
i
say
laura
said
laurie
very
fast
you
might
just
give
a
squiz
at
my
coat
before
this
afternoon
see
if
it
wants
i
will
said
she
suddenly
she
could
stop
herself
she
ran
at
laurie
and
gave
him
a
small
quick
squeeze
oh
i
do
love
parties
do
you
gasped
laura
said
laurie
warm
boyish
voice
and
he
squeezed
his
sister
too
and
gave
her
a
gentle
push
dash
off
to
the
telephone
old
the
telephone
yes
yes
oh
yes
kitty
good
morning
dear
come
to
lunch
do
dear
delighted
of
course
it
will
only
be
a
very
scratch
meal
just
the
sandwich
crusts
and
broken
and
left
over
yes
is
it
a
perfect
morning
your
white
oh
i
certainly
should
one
moment
hold
the
line
mother
and
laura
sat
back
what
mother
ca
sheridan
voice
floated
down
the
stairs
tell
her
to
wear
that
sweet
hat
she
had
on
last
mother
says
you
to
wear
that
sweet
hat
you
had
on
last
sunday
good
one
laura
put
back
the
receiver
flung
her
arms
over
her
head
took
a
deep
breath
stretched
and
let
them
fall
huh
she
sighed
and
the
moment
after
the
sigh
she
sat
up
quickly
she
was
still
listening
all
the
doors
in
the
house
seemed
to
be
open
the
house
was
alive
with
soft
quick
steps
and
running
voices
the
green
baize
door
that
led
to
the
kitchen
regions
swung
open
and
shut
with
a
muffled
thud
and
now
there
came
a
long
chuckling
absurd
sound
it
was
the
heavy
piano
being
moved
on
its
stiff
castors
but
the
air
if
you
stopped
to
notice
was
the
air
always
like
this
little
faint
winds
were
playing
chase
in
at
the
tops
of
the
windows
out
at
the
doors
and
there
were
two
tiny
spots
of
sun
one
on
the
inkpot
one
on
a
silver
photograph
frame
playing
too
darling
little
spots
especially
the
one
on
the
inkpot
lid
it
was
quite
warm
a
warm
little
silver
star
she
could
have
kissed
it
the
front
door
bell
pealed
and
there
sounded
the
rustle
of
print
skirt
on
the
stairs
a
man
voice
murmured
sadie
answered
careless
i
sure
i
do
know
wait
i
ask
mrs
what
is
it
sadie
laura
came
into
the
hall
it
the
florist
miss
it
was
indeed
there
just
inside
the
door
stood
a
wide
shallow
tray
full
of
pots
of
pink
lilies
no
other
kind
nothing
but
lilies
canna
lilies
big
pink
flowers
wide
open
radiant
almost
frighteningly
alive
on
bright
crimson
stems
sadie
said
laura
and
the
sound
was
like
a
little
moan
she
crouched
down
as
if
to
warm
herself
at
that
blaze
of
lilies
she
felt
they
were
in
her
fingers
on
her
lips
growing
in
her
breast
it
some
mistake
she
said
faintly
nobody
ever
ordered
so
many
sadie
go
and
find
but
at
that
moment
sheridan
joined
them
it
quite
right
she
said
calmly
yes
i
ordered
them
are
they
lovely
she
pressed
laura
arm
i
was
passing
the
shop
yesterday
and
i
saw
them
in
the
window
and
i
suddenly
thought
for
once
in
my
life
i
shall
have
enough
canna
lilies
the
will
be
a
good
but
i
thought
you
said
you
did
mean
to
interfere
said
laura
sadie
had
gone
the
florist
man
was
still
outside
at
his
van
she
put
her
arm
round
her
mother
neck
and
gently
very
gently
she
bit
her
mother
ear
my
darling
child
you
would
like
a
logical
mother
would
you
do
that
here
the
he
carried
more
lilies
still
another
whole
tray
bank
them
up
just
inside
the
door
on
both
sides
of
the
porch
please
said
sheridan
do
you
agree
laura
oh
i
do
in
the
meg
jose
and
good
little
hans
had
at
last
succeeded
in
moving
the
piano
now
if
we
put
this
chesterfield
against
the
wall
and
move
everything
out
of
the
room
except
the
chairs
do
you
think
hans
move
these
tables
into
the
and
bring
a
sweeper
to
take
these
marks
off
the
carpet
and
one
moment
hans
jose
loved
giving
orders
to
the
servants
and
they
loved
obeying
her
she
always
made
them
feel
they
were
taking
part
in
some
drama
tell
mother
and
miss
laura
to
come
here
at
once
very
good
miss
she
turned
to
meg
i
want
to
hear
what
the
piano
sounds
like
just
in
case
i
asked
to
sing
this
afternoon
let
try
over
life
is
weary
pom
the
piano
burst
out
so
passionately
that
jose
face
changed
she
clasped
her
hands
she
looked
mournfully
and
enigmatically
at
her
mother
and
laura
as
they
came
in
this
life
is
a
tear
a
sigh
a
love
that
this
life
is
a
tear
a
sigh
a
love
that
and
then
but
at
the
word
and
although
the
piano
sounded
more
desperate
than
ever
her
face
broke
into
a
brilliant
dreadfully
unsympathetic
smile
are
i
in
good
voice
mummy
she
beamed
this
life
is
hope
comes
to
die
a
dream
a
but
now
sadie
interrupted
them
what
is
it
sadie
if
you
please
m
cook
says
have
you
got
the
flags
for
the
sandwiches
the
flags
for
the
sandwiches
sadie
echoed
sheridan
dreamily
and
the
children
knew
by
her
face
that
she
had
got
them
let
me
and
she
said
to
sadie
firmly
tell
cook
i
let
her
have
them
in
ten
sadie
went
now
laura
said
her
mother
quickly
come
with
me
into
the
i
got
the
names
somewhere
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
you
have
to
write
them
out
for
me
meg
go
upstairs
this
minute
and
take
that
wet
thing
off
your
head
jose
run
and
finish
dressing
this
instant
do
you
hear
me
children
or
shall
i
have
to
tell
your
father
when
he
comes
home
and
and
jose
pacify
cook
if
you
do
go
into
the
kitchen
will
you
i
terrified
of
her
this
the
envelope
was
found
at
last
behind
the
clock
though
how
it
had
got
there
sheridan
could
not
imagine
one
of
you
children
must
have
stolen
it
out
of
my
bag
because
i
remember
vividly
cream
cheese
and
have
you
done
that
egg
and
sheridan
held
the
envelope
away
from
her
it
looks
like
mice
it
ca
be
mice
can
it
olive
pet
said
laura
looking
over
her
shoulder
yes
of
course
olive
what
a
horrible
combination
it
sounds
egg
and
they
were
finished
at
last
and
laura
took
them
off
to
the
kitchen
she
found
jose
there
pacifying
the
cook
who
did
not
look
at
all
terrifying
i
have
never
seen
such
exquisite
sandwiches
said
jose
rapturous
voice
how
many
kinds
did
you
say
there
were
cook
fifteen
fifteen
miss
well
cook
i
congratulate
cook
swept
up
crusts
with
the
long
sandwich
knife
and
smiled
broadly
godber
has
come
announced
sadie
issuing
out
of
the
pantry
she
had
seen
the
man
pass
the
window
that
meant
the
cream
puffs
had
come
godber
were
famous
for
their
cream
puffs
nobody
ever
thought
of
making
them
at
home
bring
them
in
and
put
them
on
the
table
my
girl
ordered
cook
sadie
brought
them
in
and
went
back
to
the
door
of
course
laura
and
jose
were
far
too
to
really
care
about
such
things
all
the
same
they
could
help
agreeing
that
the
puffs
looked
very
attractive
very
cook
began
arranging
them
shaking
off
the
extra
icing
sugar
do
they
carry
one
back
to
all
one
parties
said
laura
i
suppose
they
do
said
practical
jose
who
never
liked
to
be
carried
back
they
look
beautifully
light
and
feathery
i
must
have
one
each
my
dears
said
cook
in
her
comfortable
voice
yer
ma
wo
oh
impossible
fancy
cream
puffs
so
soon
after
breakfast
the
very
idea
made
one
shudder
all
the
same
two
minutes
later
jose
and
laura
were
licking
their
fingers
with
that
absorbed
inward
look
that
only
comes
from
whipped
cream
let
go
into
the
garden
out
by
the
back
way
suggested
laura
i
want
to
see
how
the
men
are
getting
on
with
the
marquee
they
such
awfully
nice
but
the
back
door
was
blocked
by
cook
sadie
godber
man
and
hans
something
had
happened
clucked
cook
like
an
agitated
hen
sadie
had
her
hand
clapped
to
her
cheek
as
though
she
had
toothache
hans
face
was
screwed
up
in
the
effort
to
understand
only
godber
man
seemed
to
be
enjoying
himself
it
was
his
story
what
the
matter
what
happened
there
been
a
horrible
accident
said
cook
a
man
a
man
killed
where
how
when
but
godber
man
was
going
to
have
his
story
snatched
from
under
his
very
nose
know
those
little
cottages
just
below
here
miss
know
them
of
course
she
knew
them
well
there
a
young
chap
living
there
name
of
scott
a
carter
his
horse
shied
at
a
corner
of
hawke
street
this
morning
and
he
was
thrown
out
on
the
back
of
his
head
dead
laura
stared
at
godber
man
dead
when
they
picked
him
up
said
godber
man
with
relish
they
were
taking
the
body
home
as
i
come
up
and
he
said
to
the
cook
he
left
a
wife
and
five
little
jose
come
laura
caught
hold
of
her
sister
sleeve
and
dragged
her
through
the
kitchen
to
the
other
side
of
the
green
baize
door
there
she
paused
and
leaned
against
it
jose
she
said
horrified
however
are
we
going
to
stop
everything
stop
everything
laura
cried
jose
in
astonishment
what
do
you
mean
stop
the
of
why
did
jose
pretend
but
jose
was
still
more
amazed
stop
the
my
dear
laura
do
be
so
absurd
of
course
we
ca
do
anything
of
the
kind
nobody
expects
us
to
do
be
so
but
we
ca
possibly
have
a
with
a
man
dead
just
outside
the
front
that
really
was
extravagant
for
the
little
cottages
were
in
a
lane
to
themselves
at
the
very
bottom
of
a
steep
rise
that
led
up
to
the
house
a
broad
road
ran
between
true
they
were
far
too
near
they
were
the
greatest
possible
eyesore
and
they
had
no
right
to
be
in
that
neighbourhood
at
all
they
were
little
mean
dwellings
painted
a
chocolate
brown
in
the
garden
patches
there
was
nothing
but
cabbage
stalks
sick
hens
and
tomato
cans
the
very
smoke
coming
out
of
their
chimneys
was
little
rags
and
shreds
of
smoke
so
unlike
the
great
silvery
plumes
that
uncurled
from
the
chimneys
washerwomen
lived
in
the
lane
and
sweeps
and
a
cobbler
and
a
man
whose
was
studded
all
over
with
minute
children
swarmed
when
the
sheridans
were
little
they
were
forbidden
to
set
foot
there
because
of
the
revolting
language
and
of
what
they
might
catch
but
since
they
were
grown
up
laura
and
laurie
on
their
prowls
sometimes
walked
through
it
was
disgusting
and
sordid
they
came
out
with
a
shudder
but
still
one
must
go
everywhere
one
must
see
everything
so
through
they
went
and
just
think
of
what
the
band
would
sound
like
to
that
poor
woman
said
laura
oh
laura
jose
began
to
be
seriously
annoyed
if
you
going
to
stop
a
band
playing
every
time
some
one
has
an
accident
you
lead
a
very
strenuous
life
i
every
bit
as
sorry
about
it
as
you
i
feel
just
as
her
eyes
hardened
she
looked
at
her
sister
just
as
she
used
to
when
they
were
little
and
fighting
together
you
wo
bring
a
drunken
workman
back
to
life
by
being
sentimental
she
said
softly
drunk
who
said
he
was
drunk
laura
turned
furiously
on
jose
she
said
just
as
they
had
used
to
say
on
those
occasions
i
going
straight
up
to
tell
do
dear
cooed
jose
mother
can
i
come
into
your
room
laura
turned
the
big
glass
of
course
child
why
what
the
matter
what
given
you
such
a
colour
and
sheridan
turned
round
from
her
she
was
trying
on
a
new
hat
mother
a
man
been
killed
began
laura
not
in
the
garden
interrupted
her
mother
no
no
oh
what
a
fright
you
gave
me
sheridan
sighed
with
relief
and
took
off
the
big
hat
and
held
it
on
her
knees
but
listen
mother
said
laura
breathless
she
told
the
dreadful
story
of
course
we
ca
have
our
party
can
we
she
pleaded
the
band
and
everybody
arriving
they
hear
us
mother
they
nearly
neighbours
to
laura
astonishment
her
mother
behaved
just
like
jose
it
was
harder
to
bear
because
she
seemed
amused
she
refused
to
take
laura
seriously
but
my
dear
child
use
your
common
sense
it
only
by
accident
heard
of
it
if
some
one
had
died
there
normally
and
i
ca
understand
how
they
keep
alive
in
those
poky
little
holes
we
should
still
be
having
our
party
should
we
laura
had
to
say
yes
to
that
but
she
felt
it
was
all
wrong
she
sat
down
on
her
mother
sofa
and
pinched
the
cushion
frill
mother
is
it
terribly
heartless
of
us
she
asked
darling
sheridan
got
up
and
came
over
to
her
carrying
the
hat
before
laura
could
stop
her
she
had
popped
it
on
my
child
said
her
mother
the
hat
is
yours
it
made
for
you
it
much
too
young
for
me
i
have
never
seen
you
look
such
a
picture
look
at
yourself
and
she
held
up
her
but
mother
laura
began
again
she
could
look
at
herself
she
turned
aside
this
time
sheridan
lost
patience
just
as
jose
had
done
you
are
being
very
absurd
laura
she
said
coldly
people
like
that
do
expect
sacrifices
from
us
and
it
not
very
sympathetic
to
spoil
everybody
enjoyment
as
you
doing
i
do
understand
said
laura
and
she
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
into
her
own
bedroom
there
quite
by
chance
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
this
charming
girl
in
the
mirror
in
her
black
hat
trimmed
with
gold
daisies
and
a
long
black
velvet
ribbon
never
had
she
imagined
she
could
look
like
that
is
mother
right
she
thought
and
now
she
hoped
her
mother
was
right
am
i
being
extravagant
perhaps
it
was
extravagant
just
for
a
moment
she
had
another
glimpse
of
that
poor
woman
and
those
little
children
and
the
body
being
carried
into
the
house
but
it
all
seemed
blurred
unreal
like
a
picture
in
the
newspaper
i
remember
it
again
after
the
party
over
she
decided
and
somehow
that
seemed
quite
the
best
plan
lunch
was
over
by
one
by
two
they
were
all
ready
for
the
fray
the
band
had
arrived
and
was
established
in
a
corner
of
the
my
dear
trilled
kitty
maitland
are
they
too
like
frogs
for
words
you
ought
to
have
arranged
them
round
the
pond
with
the
conductor
in
the
middle
on
a
laurie
arrived
and
hailed
them
on
his
way
to
dress
at
the
sight
of
him
laura
remembered
the
accident
again
she
wanted
to
tell
him
if
laurie
agreed
with
the
others
then
it
was
bound
to
be
all
right
and
she
followed
him
into
the
hall
laurie
hallo
he
was
upstairs
but
when
he
turned
round
and
saw
laura
he
suddenly
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
goggled
his
eyes
at
her
my
word
laura
you
do
look
stunning
said
laurie
what
an
absolutely
topping
hat
laura
said
faintly
is
it
and
smiled
up
at
laurie
and
did
tell
him
after
all
soon
after
that
people
began
coming
in
streams
the
band
struck
up
the
hired
waiters
ran
from
the
house
to
the
marquee
wherever
you
looked
there
were
couples
strolling
bending
to
the
flowers
greeting
moving
on
over
the
lawn
they
were
like
bright
birds
that
had
alighted
in
the
sheridans
garden
for
this
one
afternoon
on
their
way
to
where
ah
what
happiness
it
is
to
be
with
people
who
all
are
happy
to
press
hands
press
cheeks
smile
into
eyes
darling
laura
how
well
you
look
what
a
becoming
hat
child
laura
you
look
quite
spanish
i
never
seen
you
look
so
and
laura
glowing
answered
softly
have
you
had
tea
wo
you
have
an
ice
the
ices
really
are
rather
she
ran
to
her
father
and
begged
him
daddy
darling
ca
the
band
have
something
to
drink
and
the
perfect
afternoon
slowly
ripened
slowly
faded
slowly
its
petals
closed
never
a
more
delightful
the
greatest
success
quite
the
most
laura
helped
her
mother
with
the
they
stood
side
by
side
in
the
porch
till
it
was
all
over
all
over
all
over
thank
heaven
said
sheridan
round
up
the
others
laura
let
go
and
have
some
fresh
coffee
i
exhausted
yes
it
been
very
successful
but
oh
these
parties
these
parties
why
will
you
children
insist
on
giving
parties
and
they
all
of
them
sat
down
in
the
deserted
marquee
have
a
sandwich
daddy
dear
i
wrote
the
sheridan
took
a
bite
and
the
sandwich
was
gone
he
took
another
i
suppose
you
did
hear
of
a
beastly
accident
that
happened
he
said
my
dear
said
sheridan
holding
up
her
hand
we
did
it
nearly
ruined
the
party
laura
insisted
we
should
put
it
oh
mother
laura
did
want
to
be
teased
about
it
it
was
a
horrible
affair
all
the
same
said
sheridan
the
chap
was
married
too
lived
just
below
in
the
lane
and
leaves
a
wife
and
half
a
dozen
kiddies
so
they
an
awkward
little
silence
fell
sheridan
fidgeted
with
her
cup
really
it
was
very
tactless
of
father
suddenly
she
looked
up
there
on
the
table
were
all
those
sandwiches
cakes
puffs
all
uneaten
all
going
to
be
wasted
she
had
one
of
her
brilliant
ideas
i
know
she
said
let
make
up
a
basket
let
send
that
poor
creature
some
of
this
perfectly
good
food
at
any
rate
it
will
be
the
greatest
treat
for
the
children
do
you
agree
and
she
sure
to
have
neighbours
calling
in
and
so
on
what
a
point
to
have
it
all
ready
prepared
laura
she
jumped
up
get
me
the
big
basket
out
of
the
stairs
but
mother
do
you
really
think
it
a
good
idea
said
laura
again
how
curious
she
seemed
to
be
different
from
them
all
to
take
scraps
from
their
party
would
the
poor
woman
really
like
that
of
course
what
the
matter
with
you
an
hour
or
two
ago
you
were
insisting
on
us
being
sympathetic
and
now
oh
well
laura
ran
for
the
basket
it
was
filled
it
was
heaped
by
her
mother
take
it
yourself
darling
said
she
run
down
just
as
you
are
no
wait
take
the
arum
lilies
too
people
of
that
class
are
so
impressed
by
arum
the
stems
will
ruin
her
lace
frock
said
practical
jose
so
they
would
just
in
time
only
the
basket
then
and
laura
her
mother
followed
her
out
of
the
marquee
do
on
any
account
what
mother
no
better
not
put
such
ideas
into
the
child
head
nothing
run
it
was
just
growing
dusky
as
laura
shut
their
garden
gates
a
big
dog
ran
by
like
a
shadow
the
road
gleamed
white
and
down
below
in
the
hollow
the
little
cottages
were
in
deep
shade
how
quiet
it
seemed
after
the
afternoon
here
she
was
going
down
the
hill
to
somewhere
where
a
man
lay
dead
and
she
could
realize
it
why
could
she
she
stopped
a
minute
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
kisses
voices
tinkling
spoons
laughter
the
smell
of
crushed
grass
were
somehow
inside
her
she
had
no
room
for
anything
else
how
strange
she
looked
up
at
the
pale
sky
and
all
she
thought
was
yes
it
was
the
most
successful
now
the
broad
road
was
crossed
the
lane
began
smoky
and
dark
women
in
shawls
and
men
tweed
caps
hurried
by
men
hung
over
the
palings
the
children
played
in
the
doorways
a
low
hum
came
from
the
mean
little
cottages
in
some
of
them
there
was
a
flicker
of
light
and
a
shadow
moved
across
the
window
laura
bent
her
head
and
hurried
on
she
wished
now
she
had
put
on
a
coat
how
her
frock
shone
and
the
big
hat
with
the
velvet
streamer
if
only
it
was
another
hat
were
the
people
looking
at
her
they
must
be
it
was
a
mistake
to
have
come
she
knew
all
along
it
was
a
mistake
should
she
go
back
even
now
no
too
late
this
was
the
house
it
must
be
a
dark
knot
of
people
stood
outside
beside
the
gate
an
old
old
woman
with
a
crutch
sat
in
a
chair
watching
she
had
her
feet
on
a
newspaper
the
voices
stopped
as
laura
drew
near
the
group
parted
it
was
as
though
she
was
expected
as
though
they
had
known
she
was
coming
here
laura
was
terribly
nervous
tossing
the
velvet
ribbon
over
her
shoulder
she
said
to
a
woman
standing
by
is
this
scott
house
and
the
woman
smiling
queerly
said
it
is
my
oh
to
be
away
from
this
she
actually
said
help
me
god
as
she
walked
up
the
tiny
path
and
knocked
to
be
away
from
those
staring
eyes
or
to
be
covered
up
in
anything
one
of
those
women
shawls
even
just
leave
the
basket
and
go
she
decided
i
sha
even
wait
for
it
to
be
emptied
then
the
door
opened
a
little
woman
in
black
showed
in
the
gloom
laura
said
are
you
scott
but
to
her
horror
the
woman
answered
walk
in
please
miss
and
she
was
shut
in
the
passage
no
said
laura
i
do
want
to
come
in
i
only
want
to
leave
this
basket
mother
sent
the
little
woman
in
the
gloomy
passage
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
step
this
way
please
miss
she
said
in
an
oily
voice
and
laura
followed
her
she
found
herself
in
a
wretched
little
low
kitchen
lighted
by
a
smoky
lamp
there
was
a
woman
sitting
before
the
fire
em
said
the
little
creature
who
had
let
her
in
em
it
a
young
she
turned
to
laura
she
said
meaningly
i
sister
miss
you
excuse
wo
you
oh
but
of
course
said
laura
please
please
do
disturb
her
i
i
only
want
to
leave
but
at
that
moment
the
woman
at
the
fire
turned
round
her
face
puffed
up
red
with
swollen
eyes
and
swollen
lips
looked
terrible
she
seemed
as
though
she
could
understand
why
laura
was
there
what
did
it
mean
why
was
this
stranger
standing
in
the
kitchen
with
a
basket
what
was
it
all
about
and
the
poor
face
puckered
up
again
all
right
my
dear
said
the
other
i
thenk
the
young
and
again
she
began
you
excuse
her
miss
i
sure
and
her
face
swollen
too
tried
an
oily
smile
laura
only
wanted
to
get
out
to
get
away
she
was
back
in
the
passage
the
door
opened
she
walked
straight
through
into
the
bedroom
where
the
dead
man
was
lying
you
like
a
look
at
would
you
said
em
sister
and
she
brushed
past
laura
over
to
the
bed
do
be
afraid
my
lass
and
now
her
voice
sounded
fond
and
sly
and
fondly
she
drew
down
the
sheet
looks
a
picture
there
nothing
to
show
come
along
my
laura
came
there
lay
a
young
man
fast
asleep
sleeping
so
soundly
so
deeply
that
he
was
far
far
away
from
them
both
oh
so
remote
so
peaceful
he
was
dreaming
never
wake
him
up
again
his
head
was
sunk
in
the
pillow
his
eyes
were
closed
they
were
blind
under
the
closed
eyelids
he
was
given
up
to
his
dream
what
did
and
baskets
and
lace
frocks
matter
to
him
he
was
far
from
all
those
things
he
was
wonderful
beautiful
while
they
were
laughing
and
while
the
band
was
playing
this
marvel
had
come
to
the
lane
happy
happy
all
is
well
said
that
sleeping
face
this
is
just
as
it
should
be
i
am
content
but
all
the
same
you
had
to
cry
and
she
could
go
out
of
the
room
without
saying
something
to
him
laura
gave
a
loud
childish
sob
forgive
my
hat
she
said
and
this
time
she
did
wait
for
em
sister
she
found
her
way
out
of
the
door
down
the
path
past
all
those
dark
people
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
she
met
laurie
he
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
is
that
you
laura
mother
was
getting
anxious
was
it
all
right
yes
quite
oh
laurie
she
took
his
arm
she
pressed
up
against
him
i
say
you
not
crying
are
you
asked
her
brother
laura
shook
her
head
she
was
laurie
put
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
do
cry
he
said
in
his
warm
loving
voice
was
it
awful
no
sobbed
laura
it
was
simply
marvellous
but
laurie
she
stopped
she
looked
at
her
brother
is
life
she
stammered
life
but
what
life
was
she
could
explain
no
matter
he
quite
understood
is
it
darling
said
laurie
the
daughters
of
the
late
colonel
chapter
the
week
after
was
one
of
the
busiest
weeks
of
their
lives
even
when
they
went
to
bed
it
was
only
their
bodies
that
lay
down
and
rested
their
minds
went
on
thinking
things
out
talking
things
over
wondering
deciding
trying
to
remember
where
constantia
lay
like
a
statue
her
hands
by
her
sides
her
feet
just
overlapping
each
other
the
sheet
up
to
her
chin
she
stared
at
the
ceiling
do
you
think
father
would
mind
if
we
gave
his
to
the
porter
the
porter
snapped
josephine
why
ever
the
porter
what
a
very
extraordinary
idea
because
said
constantia
slowly
he
must
often
have
to
go
to
funerals
and
i
noticed
at
at
the
cemetery
that
he
only
had
a
she
paused
i
thought
then
how
very
much
he
appreciate
a
we
ought
to
give
him
a
present
too
he
was
always
very
nice
to
but
cried
josephine
flouncing
on
her
pillow
and
staring
across
the
dark
at
constantia
father
head
and
suddenly
for
one
awful
moment
she
nearly
giggled
not
of
course
that
she
felt
in
the
least
like
giggling
it
must
have
been
habit
years
ago
when
they
had
stayed
awake
at
night
talking
their
beds
had
simply
heaved
and
now
the
head
disappearing
popped
out
like
a
candle
under
father
hat
the
giggle
mounted
mounted
she
clenched
her
hands
she
fought
it
down
she
frowned
fiercely
at
the
dark
and
said
remember
terribly
sternly
we
can
decide
she
said
constantia
had
noticed
nothing
she
sighed
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
our
dyed
as
well
black
almost
shrieked
josephine
well
what
else
said
constantia
i
was
thinking
it
does
seem
quite
sincere
in
a
way
to
wear
black
out
of
doors
and
when
we
fully
dressed
and
then
when
we
at
home
but
nobody
sees
us
said
josephine
she
gave
the
bedclothes
such
a
twitch
that
both
her
feet
became
uncovered
and
she
had
to
creep
up
the
pillows
to
get
them
well
under
again
kate
does
said
constantia
and
the
postman
very
well
josephine
thought
of
her
slippers
which
matched
her
and
of
constantia
favourite
indefinite
green
ones
which
went
with
hers
black
two
black
and
two
pairs
of
black
woolly
slippers
creeping
off
to
the
bathroom
like
black
cats
i
do
think
it
absolutely
necessary
said
she
silence
then
constantia
said
we
shall
have
to
post
the
papers
with
the
notice
in
them
to
catch
the
ceylon
mail
how
many
letters
have
we
had
up
till
now
josephine
had
replied
to
them
all
and
times
when
she
came
to
we
miss
our
dear
father
so
much
she
had
broken
down
and
had
to
use
her
handkerchief
and
on
some
of
them
even
to
soak
up
a
very
tear
with
an
edge
of
strange
she
could
have
put
it
on
but
times
even
now
though
when
she
said
over
to
herself
sadly
we
miss
our
dear
father
so
much
she
could
have
cried
if
she
wanted
to
have
you
got
enough
stamps
came
from
constantia
oh
how
can
i
tell
said
josephine
crossly
what
the
good
of
asking
me
that
now
i
was
just
wondering
said
constantia
mildly
silence
again
there
came
a
little
rustle
a
scurry
a
hop
a
mouse
said
constantia
it
ca
be
a
mouse
because
there
are
any
crumbs
said
josephine
but
it
does
know
there
are
said
constantia
a
spasm
of
pity
squeezed
her
heart
poor
little
thing
she
wished
left
a
tiny
piece
of
biscuit
on
the
it
was
awful
to
think
of
it
not
finding
anything
what
would
it
do
i
ca
think
how
they
manage
to
live
at
all
she
said
slowly
who
demanded
josephine
and
constantia
said
more
loudly
than
she
meant
to
josephine
was
furious
oh
what
nonsense
con
she
said
what
have
mice
got
to
do
with
it
you
i
do
think
i
am
said
constantia
she
shut
her
eyes
to
make
sure
she
was
josephine
arched
her
spine
pulled
up
her
knees
folded
her
arms
so
that
her
fists
came
under
her
ears
and
pressed
her
cheek
hard
against
the
pillow
chapter
another
thing
which
complicated
matters
was
they
had
nurse
andrews
staying
on
with
them
that
week
it
was
their
own
fault
they
had
asked
her
it
was
josephine
idea
on
the
morning
well
on
the
last
morning
when
the
doctor
had
gone
josephine
had
said
to
constantia
do
you
think
it
would
be
rather
nice
if
we
asked
nurse
andrews
to
stay
on
for
a
week
as
our
guest
very
nice
said
constantia
i
thought
went
on
josephine
quickly
i
should
just
say
this
afternoon
after
i
paid
her
sister
and
i
would
be
very
pleased
after
all
you
done
for
us
nurse
andrews
if
you
would
stay
on
for
a
week
as
our
guest
i
have
to
put
that
in
about
being
our
guest
in
case
oh
but
she
could
hardly
expect
to
be
paid
cried
constantia
one
never
knows
said
josephine
sagely
nurse
andrews
had
of
course
jumped
at
the
idea
but
it
was
a
bother
it
meant
they
had
to
have
regular
meals
at
the
proper
times
whereas
if
they
been
alone
they
could
just
have
asked
kate
if
she
would
have
minded
bringing
them
a
tray
wherever
they
were
and
now
that
the
strain
was
over
were
rather
a
trial
nurse
andrews
was
simply
fearful
about
butter
really
they
help
feeling
that
about
butter
at
least
she
took
advantage
of
their
kindness
and
she
had
that
maddening
habit
of
asking
for
just
an
inch
more
of
bread
to
finish
what
she
had
on
her
plate
and
then
at
the
last
mouthful
of
course
it
was
taking
another
helping
josephine
got
very
red
when
this
happened
and
she
fastened
her
small
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
as
if
she
saw
a
minute
strange
insect
creeping
through
the
web
of
it
but
long
pale
face
lengthened
and
set
and
she
gazed
away
away
far
over
the
desert
to
where
that
line
of
camels
unwound
like
a
thread
of
wool
when
i
was
with
lady
tukes
said
nurse
andrews
she
had
such
a
dainty
little
contrayvance
for
the
buttah
it
was
a
silvah
cupid
balanced
on
the
on
the
bordah
of
a
glass
dish
holding
a
tayny
fork
and
when
you
wanted
some
buttah
you
simply
pressed
his
foot
and
he
bent
down
and
speared
you
a
piece
it
was
quite
a
josephine
could
hardly
bear
that
but
i
think
those
things
are
very
extravagant
was
all
she
said
but
whey
asked
nurse
andrews
beaming
through
her
eyeglasses
no
one
surely
would
take
more
buttah
than
one
wanted
would
one
ring
con
cried
josephine
she
could
trust
herself
to
reply
and
proud
young
kate
the
enchanted
princess
came
in
to
see
what
the
old
tabbies
wanted
now
she
snatched
away
their
plates
of
mock
something
or
other
and
slapped
down
a
white
terrified
blancmange
jam
please
kate
said
josephine
kindly
kate
knelt
and
burst
open
the
sideboard
lifted
the
lid
of
the
saw
it
was
empty
put
it
on
the
table
and
stalked
off
i
afraid
said
nurse
andrews
a
moment
later
there
is
oh
what
a
bother
said
josephine
she
bit
her
lip
what
had
we
better
do
constantia
looked
dubious
we
ca
disturb
kate
again
she
said
softly
nurse
andrews
waited
smiling
at
them
both
her
eyes
wandered
spying
at
everything
behind
her
eyeglasses
constantia
in
despair
went
back
to
her
camels
josephine
frowned
heavily
concentrated
if
it
had
been
for
this
idiotic
woman
she
and
con
would
of
course
have
eaten
their
blancmange
without
suddenly
the
idea
came
i
know
she
said
marmalade
there
some
marmalade
in
the
sideboard
get
it
i
hope
laughed
nurse
andrews
and
her
laugh
was
like
a
spoon
tinkling
against
a
i
hope
it
not
very
bittah
chapter
but
after
all
it
was
not
long
now
and
then
she
be
gone
for
good
and
there
was
no
getting
over
the
fact
that
she
had
been
very
kind
to
father
she
had
nursed
him
day
and
night
at
the
end
indeed
both
constantia
and
josephine
felt
privately
she
had
rather
overdone
the
not
leaving
him
at
the
very
last
for
when
they
had
gone
in
to
say
nurse
andrews
had
sat
beside
his
bed
the
whole
time
holding
his
wrist
and
pretending
to
look
at
her
watch
it
could
have
been
necessary
it
was
so
tactless
too
supposing
father
had
wanted
to
say
something
something
private
to
them
not
that
he
had
oh
far
from
it
he
lay
there
purple
a
dark
angry
purple
in
the
face
and
never
even
looked
at
them
when
they
came
in
then
as
they
were
standing
there
wondering
what
to
do
he
had
suddenly
opened
one
eye
oh
what
a
difference
it
would
have
made
what
a
difference
to
their
memory
of
him
how
much
easier
to
tell
people
about
it
if
he
had
only
opened
both
but
no
one
eye
only
it
glared
at
them
a
moment
and
then
went
out
chapter
it
had
made
it
very
awkward
for
them
when
farolles
of
john
called
the
same
afternoon
the
end
was
quite
peaceful
i
trust
were
the
first
words
he
said
as
he
glided
towards
them
through
the
dark
quite
said
josephine
faintly
they
both
hung
their
heads
both
of
them
felt
certain
that
eye
was
at
all
a
peaceful
eye
wo
you
sit
down
said
josephine
thank
you
miss
pinner
said
farolles
gratefully
he
folded
his
and
began
to
lower
himself
into
father
but
just
as
he
touched
it
he
almost
sprang
up
and
slid
into
the
next
chair
instead
he
coughed
josephine
clasped
her
hands
constantia
looked
vague
i
want
you
to
feel
miss
pinner
said
farolles
and
you
miss
constantia
that
i
trying
to
be
helpful
i
want
to
be
helpful
to
you
both
if
you
will
let
me
these
are
the
times
said
mr
farolles
very
simply
and
earnestly
when
god
means
us
to
be
helpful
to
one
thank
you
very
much
farolles
said
josephine
and
constantia
not
at
all
said
farolles
gently
he
drew
his
kid
gloves
through
his
fingers
and
leaned
forward
and
if
either
of
you
would
like
a
little
communion
either
or
both
of
you
here
and
now
you
have
only
to
tell
me
a
little
communion
is
often
very
help
a
great
comfort
he
added
tenderly
but
the
idea
of
a
little
communion
terrified
them
what
in
the
by
themselves
with
no
no
altar
or
anything
the
piano
would
be
much
too
high
thought
constantia
and
farolles
could
not
possibly
lean
over
it
with
the
chalice
and
kate
would
be
sure
to
come
bursting
in
and
interrupt
them
thought
josephine
and
supposing
the
bell
rang
in
the
middle
it
might
be
somebody
important
about
their
mourning
would
they
get
up
reverently
and
go
out
or
would
they
have
to
wait
in
torture
perhaps
you
will
send
round
a
note
by
your
good
kate
if
you
would
care
for
it
later
said
farolles
oh
yes
thank
you
very
much
they
both
said
farolles
got
up
and
took
his
black
straw
hat
from
the
round
table
and
about
the
funeral
he
said
softly
i
may
arrange
that
as
your
dear
father
old
friend
and
yours
miss
pinner
and
miss
constantia
josephine
and
constantia
got
up
too
i
should
like
it
to
be
quite
simple
said
josephine
firmly
and
not
too
expensive
at
the
same
time
i
should
like
a
good
one
that
will
last
thought
dreamy
constantia
as
if
josephine
were
buying
a
nightgown
but
of
course
josephine
did
say
that
one
suitable
to
our
father
she
was
very
nervous
i
run
round
to
our
good
friend
knight
said
farolles
soothingly
i
will
ask
him
to
come
and
see
you
i
am
sure
you
will
find
him
very
helpful
chapter
well
at
any
rate
all
that
part
of
it
was
over
though
neither
of
them
could
possibly
believe
that
father
was
never
coming
back
josephine
had
had
a
moment
of
absolute
terror
at
the
cemetery
while
the
coffin
was
lowered
to
think
that
she
and
constantia
had
done
this
thing
without
asking
his
permission
what
would
father
say
when
he
found
out
for
he
was
bound
to
find
out
sooner
or
later
he
always
did
buried
you
two
girls
had
me
buried
she
heard
his
stick
thumping
oh
what
would
they
say
what
possible
excuse
could
they
make
it
sounded
such
an
appallingly
heartless
thing
to
do
such
a
wicked
advantage
to
take
of
a
person
because
he
happened
to
be
helpless
at
the
moment
the
other
people
seemed
to
treat
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
they
were
strangers
they
could
be
expected
to
understand
that
father
was
the
very
last
person
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
to
no
the
entire
blame
for
it
all
would
fall
on
her
and
constantia
and
the
expense
she
thought
stepping
into
the
cab
when
she
had
to
show
him
the
bills
what
would
he
say
then
she
heard
him
absolutely
roaring
and
do
you
expect
me
to
pay
for
this
gimcrack
excursion
of
yours
oh
groaned
poor
josephine
aloud
we
should
have
done
it
con
and
constantia
pale
as
a
lemon
in
all
that
blackness
said
in
a
frightened
whisper
done
what
jug
let
them
father
like
that
said
josephine
breaking
down
and
crying
into
her
new
mourning
handkerchief
but
what
else
could
we
have
done
asked
constantia
wonderingly
we
could
have
kept
him
jug
we
could
have
kept
him
unburied
at
any
rate
not
in
a
flat
that
josephine
blew
her
nose
the
cab
was
dreadfully
stuffy
i
do
know
she
said
forlornly
it
is
all
so
dreadful
i
feel
we
ought
to
have
tried
to
just
for
a
time
at
least
to
make
perfectly
sure
one
thing
certain
and
her
tears
sprang
out
again
father
will
never
forgive
us
for
this
never
chapter
father
would
never
forgive
them
that
was
what
they
felt
more
than
ever
when
two
mornings
later
they
went
into
his
room
to
go
through
his
things
they
had
discussed
it
quite
calmly
it
was
even
down
on
josephine
list
of
things
to
be
done
go
through
father
things
and
settle
about
but
that
was
a
very
different
matter
from
saying
after
breakfast
well
are
you
ready
con
yes
jug
when
you
then
i
think
we
better
get
it
it
was
dark
in
the
hall
it
had
been
a
rule
for
years
never
to
disturb
father
in
the
morning
whatever
happened
and
now
they
were
going
to
open
the
door
without
knocking
even
constantia
eyes
were
enormous
at
the
idea
josephine
felt
weak
in
the
knees
you
you
go
first
she
gasped
pushing
constantia
but
constantia
said
as
she
always
had
said
on
those
occasions
no
jug
that
not
fair
you
the
josephine
was
just
going
to
say
what
at
other
times
she
would
have
owned
to
for
the
world
what
she
kept
for
her
very
last
weapon
but
you
the
tallest
when
they
noticed
that
the
kitchen
door
was
open
and
there
stood
kate
very
stiff
said
josephine
grasping
the
doorhandle
and
doing
her
best
to
turn
it
as
if
anything
ever
deceived
kate
it
could
be
helped
that
girl
was
then
the
door
was
shut
behind
them
but
but
they
were
in
father
room
at
all
they
might
have
suddenly
walked
through
the
wall
by
mistake
into
a
different
flat
altogether
was
the
door
just
behind
them
they
were
too
frightened
to
look
josephine
knew
that
if
it
was
it
was
holding
itself
tight
shut
constantia
felt
that
like
the
doors
in
dreams
it
had
any
handle
at
all
it
was
the
coldness
which
made
it
so
awful
or
the
whiteness
which
everything
was
covered
the
blinds
were
down
a
cloth
hung
over
the
mirror
a
sheet
hid
the
bed
a
huge
fan
of
white
paper
filled
the
fireplace
constantia
timidly
put
out
her
hand
she
almost
expected
a
snowflake
to
fall
josephine
felt
a
queer
tingling
in
her
nose
as
if
her
nose
was
freezing
then
a
cab
over
the
cobbles
below
and
the
quiet
seemed
to
shake
into
little
pieces
i
had
better
pull
up
a
blind
said
josephine
bravely
yes
it
might
be
a
good
idea
whispered
constantia
they
only
gave
the
blind
a
touch
but
it
flew
up
and
the
cord
flew
after
rolling
round
the
and
the
little
tassel
tapped
as
if
trying
to
get
free
that
was
too
much
for
constantia
do
you
think
do
you
think
we
might
put
it
off
for
another
day
she
whispered
why
snapped
josephine
feeling
as
usual
much
better
now
that
she
knew
for
certain
that
constantia
was
terrified
it
got
to
be
done
but
i
do
wish
you
would
whisper
i
did
know
i
was
whispering
whispered
constantia
and
why
do
you
keep
staring
at
the
bed
said
josephine
raising
her
voice
almost
defiantly
there
nothing
on
the
oh
jug
do
say
so
said
poor
connie
at
any
rate
not
so
josephine
felt
herself
that
she
had
gone
too
far
she
took
a
wide
swerve
over
to
the
chest
of
drawers
put
out
her
hand
but
quickly
drew
it
back
again
connie
she
gasped
and
she
wheeled
round
and
leaned
with
her
back
against
the
chest
of
drawers
oh
jug
what
josephine
could
only
glare
she
had
the
most
extraordinary
feeling
that
she
had
just
escaped
something
simply
awful
but
how
could
she
explain
to
constantia
that
father
was
in
the
chest
of
drawers
he
was
in
the
top
drawer
with
his
handkerchiefs
and
neckties
or
in
the
next
with
his
shirts
and
pyjamas
or
in
the
lowest
of
all
with
his
suits
he
was
watching
there
hidden
away
just
behind
the
ready
to
spring
she
pulled
a
funny
face
at
constantia
just
as
she
used
to
in
the
old
days
when
she
was
going
to
cry
i
ca
open
she
nearly
wailed
no
do
jug
whispered
constantia
earnestly
it
much
better
not
to
do
let
open
anything
at
any
rate
not
for
a
long
but
but
it
seems
so
weak
said
josephine
breaking
down
but
why
not
be
weak
for
once
jug
argued
constantia
whispering
quite
fiercely
if
it
is
and
her
pale
stare
flew
from
the
locked
so
safe
to
the
huge
glittering
wardrobe
and
she
began
to
breathe
in
a
queer
panting
away
why
should
we
be
weak
for
once
in
our
lives
jug
it
quite
excusable
let
be
weak
be
weak
jug
it
much
nicer
to
be
weak
than
to
be
and
then
she
did
one
of
those
amazingly
bold
things
that
she
done
about
twice
before
in
their
lives
she
marched
over
to
the
wardrobe
turned
the
key
and
took
it
out
of
the
lock
took
it
out
of
the
lock
and
held
it
up
to
josephine
showing
josephine
by
her
extraordinary
smile
that
she
knew
what
she
done
she
risked
deliberately
father
being
in
there
among
his
overcoats
if
the
huge
wardrobe
had
lurched
forward
had
crashed
down
on
constantia
josephine
would
have
been
surprised
on
the
contrary
she
would
have
thought
it
the
only
suitable
thing
to
happen
but
nothing
happened
only
the
room
seemed
quieter
than
ever
and
the
bigger
flakes
of
cold
air
fell
on
josephine
shoulders
and
knees
she
began
to
shiver
come
jug
said
constantia
still
with
that
awful
callous
smile
and
josephine
followed
just
as
she
had
that
last
time
when
constantia
had
pushed
benny
into
the
round
pond
chapter
but
the
strain
told
on
them
when
they
were
back
in
the
they
sat
down
very
shaky
and
looked
at
each
other
i
do
feel
i
can
settle
to
anything
said
josephine
until
i
had
something
do
you
think
we
could
ask
kate
for
two
cups
of
hot
water
i
really
do
see
why
we
should
said
constantia
carefully
she
was
quite
normal
again
i
wo
ring
i
go
to
the
kitchen
door
and
ask
yes
do
said
josephine
sinking
down
into
a
chair
tell
her
just
two
cups
con
nothing
else
on
a
she
need
even
put
the
jug
on
need
she
said
constantia
as
though
kate
might
very
well
complain
if
the
jug
had
been
there
oh
no
certainly
not
the
jug
not
at
all
necessary
she
can
pour
it
direct
out
of
the
kettle
cried
josephine
feeling
that
would
be
a
indeed
their
cold
lips
quivered
at
the
greenish
brims
josephine
curved
her
small
red
hands
round
the
cup
constantia
sat
up
and
blew
on
the
wavy
steam
making
it
flutter
from
one
side
to
the
other
speaking
of
benny
said
josephine
and
though
benny
had
been
mentioned
constantia
immediately
looked
as
though
he
had
he
expect
us
to
send
him
something
of
father
of
course
but
so
difficult
to
know
what
to
send
to
you
mean
things
get
unstuck
so
on
the
voyage
murmured
constantia
no
lost
said
josephine
sharply
you
know
there
no
post
only
both
paused
to
watch
a
black
man
in
white
linen
drawers
running
through
the
pale
fields
for
dear
life
with
a
large
parcel
in
his
hands
josephine
black
man
was
tiny
he
scurried
along
glistening
like
an
ant
but
there
was
something
blind
and
tireless
about
tall
thin
fellow
which
made
him
she
decided
a
very
unpleasant
person
indeed
on
the
veranda
dressed
all
in
white
and
wearing
a
cork
helmet
stood
benny
his
right
hand
shook
up
and
down
as
father
did
when
he
was
impatient
and
behind
him
not
in
the
least
interested
sat
hilda
the
unknown
she
swung
in
a
cane
rocker
and
flicked
over
the
leaves
of
the
i
think
his
watch
would
be
the
most
suitable
present
said
josephine
constantia
looked
up
she
seemed
surprised
oh
would
you
trust
a
gold
watch
to
a
native
but
of
course
i
disguise
it
said
josephine
no
one
would
know
it
was
a
she
liked
the
idea
of
having
to
make
a
parcel
such
a
curious
shape
that
no
one
could
possibly
guess
what
it
was
she
even
thought
for
a
moment
of
hiding
the
watch
in
a
narrow
cardboard
that
she
kept
by
her
for
a
long
time
waiting
for
it
to
come
in
for
something
it
was
such
beautiful
firm
cardboard
but
no
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
occasion
it
had
lettering
on
it
medium
women
extra
firm
it
would
be
almost
too
much
of
a
surprise
for
benny
to
open
that
and
find
father
watch
inside
and
of
course
it
is
as
though
it
would
be
going
ticking
i
mean
said
constantia
who
was
still
thinking
of
the
native
love
of
jewellery
at
least
she
added
it
would
be
very
strange
if
after
all
that
time
it
chapter
josephine
made
no
reply
she
had
flown
off
on
one
of
her
tangents
she
had
suddenly
thought
of
cyril
was
it
more
usual
for
the
only
grandson
to
have
the
watch
and
then
dear
cyril
was
so
appreciative
and
a
gold
watch
meant
so
much
to
a
young
man
benny
in
all
probability
had
quite
got
out
of
the
habit
of
watches
men
so
seldom
wore
waistcoats
in
those
hot
climates
whereas
cyril
in
london
wore
them
from
year
end
to
year
end
and
it
would
be
so
nice
for
her
and
constantia
when
he
came
to
tea
to
know
it
was
there
i
see
you
got
on
watch
it
would
be
somehow
so
satisfactory
dear
boy
what
a
blow
his
sweet
sympathetic
little
note
had
been
of
course
they
quite
understood
but
it
was
most
unfortunate
it
would
have
been
such
a
point
having
him
said
josephine
and
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
so
said
constantia
not
thinking
what
she
was
saying
however
as
soon
as
he
got
back
he
was
coming
to
tea
with
his
aunties
cyril
to
tea
was
one
of
their
rare
treats
now
cyril
you
must
be
frightened
of
our
cakes
your
auntie
con
and
i
bought
them
at
buszard
this
morning
we
know
what
a
man
appetite
is
so
do
be
ashamed
of
making
a
good
josephine
cut
recklessly
into
the
rich
dark
cake
that
stood
for
her
winter
gloves
or
the
soling
and
heeling
of
constantia
only
respectable
shoes
but
cyril
was
most
unmanlike
in
appetite
i
say
aunt
josephine
i
simply
ca
i
only
just
had
lunch
you
oh
cyril
that
ca
be
true
it
after
four
cried
josephine
constantia
sat
with
her
knife
poised
over
the
it
is
all
the
same
said
cyril
i
had
to
meet
a
man
at
victoria
and
he
kept
me
hanging
about
till
there
was
only
time
to
get
lunch
and
to
come
on
here
and
he
gave
me
phew
cyril
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
a
terrific
he
said
it
was
disappointing
of
all
days
but
still
he
could
be
expected
to
know
but
you
have
a
meringue
wo
you
cyril
said
aunt
josephine
these
meringues
were
bought
specially
for
you

dear
father
was
so
fond
of
them
we
were
sure

josephine
cried
cyril
ardently

you

half
to
begin
with

all

boy
but
we
must
let
you
off

your
dear
father
still
so
fond

auntie
con
gently
she
winced
faintly
as
she
broke
through
the
shell
of
hers
well
i
do
quite
know
auntie
con
said
cyril
breezily
at
that
they
both
looked
up
do
know
almost
snapped
josephine
do
know
a
thing
like
that
about
your
own
father
cyril
surely
said
auntie
con
softly
cyril
tried
to
laugh
it
off
oh
well
he
said
it
such
a
long
time
since
he
faltered
he
stopped
their
faces
were
too
much
for
him
even
so
said
josephine
and
auntie
con
looked
cyril
put
down
his
teacup
wait
a
bit
he
cried
wait
a
bit
aunt
josephine
what
am
i
thinking
of
he
looked
up
they
were
beginning
to
brighten
cyril
slapped
his
knee
of
course
he
said
it
was
meringues
how
could
i
have
forgotten
yes
aunt
josephine
you
perfectly
right
father
most
frightfully
keen
on
they
did
only
beam
aunt
josephine
went
scarlet
with
pleasure
auntie
con
gave
a
deep
deep
sigh
and
now
cyril
you
must
come
and
see
father
said
josephine
he
knows
you
were
coming
right
said
cyril
very
firmly
and
heartily
he
got
up
from
his
chair
suddenly
he
glanced
at
the
clock
i
say
auntie
con
is
your
clock
a
bit
slow
i
got
to
meet
a
man
at
at
paddington

afraid

sha

able
to
stay
very
long
with
oh
he
wo
expect
you
to
stay
very
long
said
aunt
josephine
constantia
was
still
gazing
at
the
clock
she
could
make
up
her
mind
if
it
was
fast
or
slow
it
was
one
or
the
other
she
felt
almost
certain
of
that
at
any
rate
it
had
been
cyril
still
lingered
are
you
coming
along
auntie
con
of
course
said
josephine
we
shall
all
go
come
on
chapter
they
knocked
at
the
door
and
cyril
followed
his
aunts
into
grandfather
hot
sweetish
room
come
on
said
grandfather
pinner
do
hang
about
what
is
it
what
you
been
up
to
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
clasping
his
stick
he
had
a
thick
rug
over
his
knees
on
his
lap
there
lay
a
beautiful
pale
yellow
silk
handkerchief
it
cyril
father
said
josephine
shyly
and
she
took
cyril
hand
and
led
him
forward
good
afternoon
grandfather
said
cyril
trying
to
take
his
hand
out
of
aunt
josephine
grandfather
pinner
shot
his
eyes
at
cyril
in
the
way
he
was
famous
for
where
was
auntie
con
she
stood
on
the
other
side
of
aunt
josephine
her
long
arms
hung
down
in
front
of
her
her
hands
were
clasped
she
never
took
her
eyes
off
grandfather
well
said
grandfather
pinner
beginning
to
thump
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
what
had
he
what
had
he
got
to
tell
him
cyril
felt
himself
smiling
like
a
perfect
imbecile
the
room
was
stifling
too
but
aunt
josephine
came
to
his
rescue
she
cried
brightly
cyril
says
his
father
is
still
very
fond
of
meringues
father
eh
said
grandfather
pinner
curving
his
hand
like
a
purple
over
one
ear
josephine
repeated
cyril
says
his
father
is
still
very
fond
of
ca
hear
said
old
colonel
pinner
and
he
waved
josephine
away
with
his
stick
then
pointed
with
his
stick
to
cyril
tell
me
what
trying
to
say
he
said
my
god
must
i
said
cyril
blushing
and
staring
at
aunt
josephine
do
dear
she
smiled
it
will
please
him
so
come
on
out
with
it
cried
colonel
pinner
testily
beginning
to
thump
again
and
cyril
leaned
forward
and
yelled
father
still
very
fond
of
at
that
grandfather
pinner
jumped
as
though
he
had
been
shot
do
shout
he
cried
what
the
matter
with
the
boy
meringues
what
about
oh
aunt
josephine
must
we
go
on
groaned
cyril
desperately
it
quite
all
right
dear
boy
said
aunt
josephine
as
though
he
and
she
were
at
the
dentist
together
he
understand
in
a
and
she
whispered
to
cyril
he
getting
a
bit
deaf
you
then
she
leaned
forward
and
really
bawled
at
grandfather
pinner
cyril
only
wanted
to
tell
you
father
dear
that
his
father
is
still
very
fond
of
colonel
pinner
heard
that
time
heard
and
brooded
looking
cyril
up
and
down
what
an
esstrordinary
thing
said
old
grandfather
pinner
what
an
esstrordinary
thing
to
come
all
this
way
here
to
tell
me
and
cyril
felt
it
was
yes
i
shall
send
cyril
the
watch
said
josephine
that
would
be
very
nice
said
constantia
i
seem
to
remember
last
time
he
came
there
was
some
little
trouble
about
the
chapter
they
were
interrupted
by
kate
bursting
through
the
door
in
her
usual
fashion
as
though
she
had
discovered
some
secret
panel
in
the
wall
fried
or
boiled
asked
the
bold
voice
fried
or
boiled
josephine
and
constantia
were
quite
bewildered
for
the
moment
they
could
hardly
take
it
in
fried
or
boiled
what
kate
asked
josephine
trying
to
begin
to
concentrate
kate
gave
a
loud
sniff
well
why
did
you
say
so
immediately
josephine
reproached
her
gently
how
could
you
expect
us
to
understand
kate
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
this
world
you
know
which
are
fried
or
and
after
such
a
display
of
courage
she
said
quite
brightly
to
constantia
which
do
you
prefer
con
i
think
it
might
be
nice
to
have
it
fried
said
constantia
on
the
other
hand
of
course
boiled
fish
is
very
nice
i
think
i
prefer
both
equally
well
unless
you
in
that
case
i
shall
fry
it
said
kate
and
she
bounced
back
leaving
their
door
open
and
slamming
the
door
of
her
kitchen
josephine
gazed
at
constantia
she
raised
her
pale
eyebrows
until
they
rippled
away
into
her
pale
hair
she
got
up
she
said
in
a
very
lofty
imposing
way
do
you
mind
following
me
into
the
constantia
i
got
something
of
great
importance
to
discuss
with
for
it
was
always
to
the
they
retired
when
they
wanted
to
talk
over
kate
josephine
closed
the
door
meaningly
sit
down
constantia
she
said
still
very
grand
she
might
have
been
receiving
constantia
for
the
first
time
and
con
looked
round
vaguely
for
a
chair
as
though
she
felt
indeed
quite
a
stranger
now
the
question
is
said
josephine
bending
forward
whether
we
shall
keep
her
or
that
is
the
question
agreed
constantia
and
this
time
said
josephine
firmly
we
must
come
to
a
definite
constantia
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
she
might
begin
going
over
all
the
other
times
but
she
pulled
herself
together
and
said
yes
you
see
con
explained
josephine
everything
is
so
changed
constantia
looked
up
quickly
i
mean
went
on
josephine
we
not
dependent
on
kate
as
we
and
she
blushed
faintly
there
not
father
to
cook
that
is
perfectly
true
agreed
constantia
father
certainly
want
any
cooking
now
whatever
else
josephine
broke
in
sharply
you
not
sleepy
are
you
con
sleepy
jug
constantia
was
well
concentrate
more
said
josephine
sharply
and
she
returned
to
the
subject
what
it
comes
to
is
if
we
did
and
this
she
barely
breathed
glancing
at
the
door
give
kate
notice
she
raised
her
voice
again
we
could
manage
our
own
why
not
cried
constantia
she
could
help
smiling
the
idea
was
so
exciting
she
clasped
her
hands
what
should
we
live
on
jug
oh
eggs
in
various
forms
said
jug
lofty
again
and
besides
there
are
all
the
cooked
but
i
always
heard
said
constantia
they
are
considered
so
very
not
if
one
buys
them
in
moderation
said
josephine
but
she
tore
herself
away
from
this
fascinating
bypath
and
dragged
constantia
after
her
what
we
got
to
decide
now
however
is
whether
we
really
do
trust
kate
or
constantia
leaned
back
her
flat
little
laugh
flew
from
her
lips
is
it
curious
jug
said
she
that
just
on
this
one
subject
never
been
able
to
quite
make
up
my
mind
chapter
she
never
had
the
whole
difficulty
was
to
prove
anything
how
did
one
prove
things
how
could
one
suppose
kate
had
stood
in
front
of
her
and
deliberately
made
a
face
might
she
very
well
have
been
in
pain
was
it
impossible
at
any
rate
to
ask
kate
if
she
was
making
a
face
at
her
if
kate
answered
no
and
of
course
she
would
say
no
what
a
position
how
undignified
then
again
constantia
suspected
she
was
almost
certain
that
kate
went
to
her
chest
of
drawers
when
she
and
josephine
were
out
not
to
take
things
but
to
spy
many
times
she
had
come
back
to
find
her
amethyst
cross
in
the
most
unlikely
places
under
her
lace
ties
or
on
top
of
her
evening
bertha
more
than
once
she
had
laid
a
trap
for
kate
she
had
arranged
things
in
a
special
order
and
then
called
josephine
to
witness
you
see
jug
quite
now
we
shall
be
able
to
but
oh
dear
when
she
did
go
to
look
she
was
as
far
off
from
a
proof
as
ever
if
anything
was
displaced
it
might
so
very
well
have
happened
as
she
closed
the
drawer
a
jolt
might
have
done
it
so
easily
you
come
jug
and
decide
i
really
ca
it
too
but
after
a
pause
and
a
long
glare
josephine
would
sigh
now
you
put
the
doubt
into
my
mind
con
i
sure
i
ca
tell
well
we
ca
postpone
it
again
said
josephine
if
we
postpone
it
this
time
chapter
but
at
that
moment
in
the
street
below
a
struck
up
josephine
and
constantia
sprang
to
their
feet
together
run
con
said
josephine
run
quickly
there
sixpence
on
the
then
they
remembered
it
did
matter
they
would
never
have
to
stop
the
again
never
again
would
she
and
constantia
be
told
to
make
that
monkey
take
his
noise
somewhere
else
never
would
sound
that
loud
strange
bellow
when
father
thought
they
were
not
hurrying
enough
the
might
play
there
all
day
and
the
stick
would
not
thump
it
never
will
thump
again
it
never
will
thump
again
played
the
what
was
constantia
thinking
she
had
such
a
strange
smile
she
looked
different
she
could
be
going
to
cry
jug
jug
said
constantia
softly
pressing
her
hands
together
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
it
saturday
it
a
week
a
whole
a
week
since
father
died
a
week
since
father
died
cried
the
and
josephine
too
forgot
to
be
practical
and
sensible
she
smiled
faintly
strangely
on
the
indian
carpet
there
fell
a
square
of
sunlight
pale
red
it
came
and
went
and
came
and
stayed
deepened
until
it
shone
almost
golden
the
sun
out
said
josephine
as
though
it
really
mattered
a
perfect
fountain
of
bubbling
notes
shook
from
the
round
bright
notes
carelessly
scattered
constantia
lifted
her
big
cold
hands
as
if
to
catch
them
and
then
her
hands
fell
again
she
walked
over
to
the
mantelpiece
to
her
favourite
buddha
and
the
stone
and
gilt
image
whose
smile
always
gave
her
such
a
queer
feeling
almost
a
pain
and
yet
a
pleasant
pain
seemed
to
be
more
than
smiling
he
knew
something
he
had
a
secret
i
know
something
that
you
do
know
said
her
buddha
oh
what
was
it
what
could
it
be
and
yet
she
had
always
felt
there
was
something
the
sunlight
pressed
through
the
windows
thieved
its
way
in
flashed
its
light
over
the
furniture
and
the
photographs
josephine
watched
it
when
it
came
to
mother
photograph
the
enlargement
over
the
piano
it
lingered
as
though
puzzled
to
find
so
little
remained
of
mother
except
the
earrings
shaped
like
tiny
pagodas
and
a
black
feather
boa
why
did
the
photographs
of
dead
people
always
fade
so
wondered
josephine
as
soon
as
a
person
was
dead
their
photograph
died
too
but
of
course
this
one
of
mother
was
very
old
it
was
years
old
josephine
remembered
standing
on
a
chair
and
pointing
out
that
feather
boa
to
constantia
and
telling
her
that
it
was
a
snake
that
had
killed
their
mother
in
ceylon
would
everything
have
been
different
if
mother
died
she
did
see
why
aunt
florence
had
lived
with
them
until
they
had
left
school
and
they
had
moved
three
times
and
had
their
yearly
holiday
and
and
there
been
changes
of
servants
of
course
some
little
sparrows
young
sparrows
they
sounded
chirped
on
the
yeep
eyeep
but
josephine
felt
they
were
not
sparrows
not
on
the
it
was
inside
her
that
queer
little
crying
noise
yeep
eyeep
ah
what
was
it
crying
so
weak
and
forlorn
if
mother
had
lived
might
they
have
married
but
there
had
been
nobody
for
them
to
marry
there
had
been
father
friends
before
he
quarrelled
with
them
but
after
that
she
and
constantia
never
met
a
single
man
except
clergymen
how
did
one
meet
men
or
even
if
they
met
them
how
could
they
have
got
to
know
men
well
enough
to
be
more
than
strangers
one
read
of
people
having
adventures
being
followed
and
so
on
but
nobody
had
ever
followed
constantia
and
her
oh
yes
there
had
been
one
year
at
eastbourne
a
mysterious
man
at
their
who
had
put
a
note
on
the
jug
of
hot
water
outside
their
bedroom
door
but
by
the
time
connie
had
found
it
the
steam
had
made
the
writing
too
faint
to
read
they
could
even
make
out
to
which
of
them
it
was
addressed
and
he
had
left
next
day
and
that
was
all
the
rest
had
been
looking
after
father
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
out
of
father
way
but
now
but
now
the
thieving
sun
touched
josephine
gently
she
lifted
her
face
she
was
drawn
over
to
the
window
by
gentle
beams
until
the
stopped
playing
constantia
stayed
before
the
buddha
wondering
but
not
as
usual
not
vaguely
this
time
her
wonder
was
like
longing
she
remembered
the
times
she
had
come
in
here
crept
out
of
bed
in
her
nightgown
when
the
moon
was
full
and
lain
on
the
floor
with
her
arms
outstretched
as
though
she
was
crucified
why
the
big
pale
moon
had
made
her
do
it
the
horrible
dancing
figures
on
the
carved
screen
had
leered
at
her
and
she
had
minded
she
remembered
too
how
whenever
they
were
at
the
seaside
she
had
gone
off
by
herself
and
got
as
close
to
the
sea
as
she
could
and
sung
something
something
she
had
made
up
while
she
gazed
all
over
that
restless
water
there
had
been
this
other
life
running
out
bringing
things
home
in
bags
getting
things
on
approval
discussing
them
with
jug
and
taking
them
back
to
get
more
things
on
approval
and
arranging
father
trays
and
trying
not
to
annoy
father
but
it
all
seemed
to
have
happened
in
a
kind
of
tunnel
it
was
real
it
was
only
when
she
came
out
of
the
tunnel
into
the
moonlight
or
by
the
sea
or
into
a
thunderstorm
that
she
really
felt
herself
what
did
it
mean
what
was
it
she
was
always
wanting
what
did
it
all
lead
to
now
now
she
turned
away
from
the
buddha
with
one
of
her
vague
gestures
she
went
over
to
where
josephine
was
standing
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
josephine
something
frightfully
important
about
about
the
future
and
what
do
you
think
perhaps
she
began
but
josephine
interrupted
her
i
was
wondering
if
now
she
murmured
they
stopped
they
waited
for
each
other
go
on
con
said
josephine
no
no
jug
after
you
said
constantia
no
say
what
you
were
going
to
say
you
began
said
josephine
i
i
rather
hear
what
you
were
going
to
say
first
said
constantia
do
be
absurd
really
connie
oh
jug
a
pause
then
constantia
said
faintly
i
ca
say
what
i
was
going
to
say
jug
because
i
forgotten
what
it
was
that
i
was
going
to
josephine
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
stared
at
a
big
cloud
where
the
sun
had
been
then
she
replied
shortly
i
forgotten
and
dove
of
course
he
knew
no
man
better
that
he
had
a
ghost
of
a
chance
he
had
an
earthly
the
very
idea
of
such
a
thing
was
preposterous
so
preposterous
that
he
perfectly
understand
it
if
her
father
well
whatever
her
father
chose
to
do
he
perfectly
understand
in
fact
nothing
short
of
desperation
nothing
short
of
the
fact
that
this
was
positively
his
last
day
in
england
for
god
knows
how
long
would
have
screwed
him
up
to
it
and
even
now
he
chose
a
tie
out
of
the
chest
of
drawers
a
blue
and
cream
check
tie
and
sat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
supposing
she
replied
what
impertinence
would
he
be
surprised
not
in
the
least
he
decided
turning
up
his
soft
collar
and
turning
it
down
over
the
tie
he
expected
her
to
say
something
like
that
he
did
see
if
he
looked
at
the
affair
dead
soberly
what
else
she
could
say
here
he
was
and
nervously
he
tied
a
bow
in
front
of
the
mirror
jammed
his
hair
down
with
both
hands
pulled
out
the
flaps
of
his
jacket
pockets
making
between
and
pounds
a
year
on
a
fruit
farm
in
of
all
places
rhodesia
no
capital
not
a
penny
coming
to
him
no
chance
of
his
income
increasing
for
at
least
four
years
as
for
looks
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
he
was
completely
out
of
the
running
he
even
boast
of
health
for
the
east
africa
business
had
knocked
him
out
so
thoroughly
that
he
had
to
take
six
months
leave
he
was
still
fearfully
pale
worse
even
than
usual
this
afternoon
he
thought
bending
forward
and
peering
into
the
mirror
good
heavens
what
had
happened
his
hair
looked
almost
bright
green
dash
it
all
he
green
hair
at
all
events
that
was
a
bit
too
steep
and
then
the
green
light
trembled
in
the
glass
it
was
the
shadow
from
the
tree
outside
reggie
turned
away
took
out
his
cigarette
case
but
remembering
how
the
mater
hated
him
to
smoke
in
his
bedroom
put
it
back
again
and
drifted
over
to
the
chest
of
drawers
no
he
was
dashed
if
he
could
think
of
one
blessed
thing
in
his
favour
while
she
ah
he
stopped
dead
folded
his
arms
and
leaned
hard
against
the
chest
of
drawers
and
in
spite
of
her
position
her
father
wealth
the
fact
that
she
was
an
only
child
and
far
and
away
the
most
popular
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
in
spite
of
her
beauty
and
her
cleverness
cleverness
it
was
a
great
deal
more
than
that
there
was
really
nothing
she
could
do
he
fully
believed
had
it
been
necessary
she
would
have
been
a
genius
at
anything
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
her
parents
adored
her
and
she
them
and
they
as
soon
let
her
go
all
that
way
as
in
spite
of
every
single
thing
you
could
think
of
so
terrific
was
his
love
that
he
could
help
hoping
well
was
it
hope
or
was
this
queer
timid
longing
to
have
the
chance
of
looking
after
her
of
making
it
his
job
to
see
that
she
had
everything
she
wanted
and
that
nothing
came
near
her
that
was
perfect
just
love
how
he
loved
her
he
squeezed
hard
against
the
chest
of
drawers
and
murmured
to
it
i
love
her
i
love
her
and
just
for
the
moment
he
was
with
her
on
the
way
to
umtali
it
was
night
she
sat
in
a
corner
asleep
her
soft
chin
was
tucked
into
her
soft
collar
her
lashes
lay
on
her
cheeks
he
doted
on
her
delicate
little
nose
her
perfect
lips
her
ear
like
a
baby
and
the
curl
that
half
covered
it
they
were
passing
through
the
jungle
it
was
warm
and
dark
and
far
away
then
she
woke
up
and
said
have
i
been
asleep
and
he
answered
yes
are
you
all
right
here
let
me
and
he
leaned
forward
to
he
bent
over
her
this
was
such
bliss
that
he
could
dream
no
further
but
it
gave
him
the
courage
to
bound
downstairs
to
snatch
his
straw
hat
from
the
hall
and
to
say
as
he
closed
the
front
door
well
i
can
only
try
my
luck
that
but
his
luck
gave
him
a
nasty
jar
to
say
the
least
almost
immediately
promenading
up
and
down
the
garden
path
with
chinny
and
biddy
the
ancient
pekes
was
the
mater
of
course
reginald
was
fond
of
the
mater
and
all
that
she
she
meant
well
she
had
no
end
of
grit
and
so
on
but
there
was
no
denying
it
she
was
rather
a
grim
parent
and
there
had
been
moments
many
of
them
in
reggie
life
before
uncle
alick
died
and
left
him
the
fruit
farm
when
he
was
convinced
that
to
be
a
only
son
was
about
the
worst
punishment
a
chap
could
have
and
what
made
it
rougher
than
ever
was
that
she
was
positively
all
that
he
had
she
was
only
a
combined
parent
as
it
were
but
she
had
quarrelled
with
all
her
own
and
the
governor
relations
before
reggie
had
won
his
first
trouser
pockets
so
that
whenever
reggie
was
homesick
out
there
sitting
on
his
dark
veranda
by
starlight
while
the
gramophone
cried
dear
what
is
life
but
love
his
only
vision
was
of
the
mater
tall
and
stout
rustling
down
the
garden
path
with
chinny
and
biddy
at
her
heels
the
mater
with
her
scissors
outspread
to
snap
the
head
of
a
dead
something
or
other
stopped
at
the
sight
of
reggie
you
are
not
going
out
reginald
she
asked
seeing
that
he
was
i
be
back
for
tea
mater
said
reggie
weakly
plunging
his
hands
into
his
jacket
pockets
snip
off
came
a
head
reggie
almost
jumped
i
should
have
thought
you
could
have
spared
your
mother
your
last
afternoon
said
she
silence
the
pekes
stared
they
understood
every
word
of
the
mater
biddy
lay
down
with
her
tongue
poked
out
she
was
so
fat
and
glossy
she
looked
like
a
lump
of
toffee
but
chinny
porcelain
eyes
gloomed
at
reginald
and
he
sniffed
faintly
as
though
the
whole
world
were
one
unpleasant
smell
snip
went
the
scissors
again
poor
little
beggars
they
were
getting
it
and
where
are
you
going
if
your
mother
may
ask
asked
the
mater
it
was
over
at
last
but
reggie
did
not
slow
down
until
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
house
and
to
colonel
proctor
then
only
he
noticed
what
a
afternoon
it
was
it
had
been
raining
all
the
morning
late
summer
rain
warm
heavy
quick
and
now
the
sky
was
clear
except
for
a
long
tail
of
little
clouds
like
duckings
sailing
over
the
forest
there
was
just
enough
wind
to
shake
the
last
drops
off
the
trees
one
warm
star
splashed
on
his
hand
ping
another
drummed
on
his
hat
the
empty
road
gleamed
the
hedges
smelled
of
briar
and
how
big
and
bright
the
hollyhocks
glowed
in
the
cottage
gardens
and
here
was
colonel
proctor
here
it
was
already
his
hand
was
on
the
gate
his
elbow
jogged
the
syringa
bushes
and
petals
and
pollen
scattered
over
his
coat
sleeve
but
wait
a
bit
this
was
too
quick
altogether
he
meant
to
think
the
whole
thing
out
again
here
steady
but
he
was
walking
up
the
path
with
the
huge
rose
bushes
on
either
side
it
be
done
like
this
but
his
hand
had
grasped
the
bell
given
it
a
pull
and
started
it
pealing
wildly
as
if
he
come
to
say
the
house
was
on
fire
the
housemaid
must
have
been
in
the
hall
too
for
the
front
door
flashed
open
and
reggie
was
shut
in
the
empty
before
that
confounded
bell
had
stopped
ringing
strangely
enough
when
it
did
the
big
room
shadowy
with
some
one
parasol
lying
on
top
of
the
grand
piano
bucked
him
up
or
rather
excited
him
it
was
so
quiet
and
yet
in
one
moment
the
door
would
open
and
his
fate
be
decided
the
feeling
was
not
unlike
that
of
being
at
the
dentist
he
was
almost
reckless
but
at
the
same
time
to
his
immense
surprise
reggie
heard
himself
saying
lord
thou
knowest
thou
hast
not
done
much
for
me
that
pulled
him
up
that
made
him
realize
again
how
dead
serious
it
was
too
late
the
door
handle
turned
anne
came
in
crossed
the
shadowy
space
between
them
gave
him
her
hand
and
said
in
her
small
soft
voice
i
so
sorry
father
is
out
and
mother
is
having
a
day
in
town
there
only
me
to
entertain
you
reggie
gasped
pressed
his
own
hat
to
his
jacket
buttons
and
stammered
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
only
come
to
say
oh
cried
anne
softly
she
stepped
back
from
him
and
her
grey
eyes
danced
what
a
very
short
visit
then
watching
him
her
chin
tilted
she
laughed
outright
a
long
soft
peal
and
walked
away
from
him
over
to
the
piano
and
leaned
against
it
playing
with
the
tassel
of
the
parasol
i
so
sorry
she
said
to
be
laughing
like
this
i
do
know
why
i
do
it
just
a
bad
ha
and
suddenly
she
stamped
her
grey
shoe
and
took
a
out
of
her
white
woolly
jacket
i
really
must
conquer
it
it
too
absurd
said
she
good
heavens
anne
cried
reggie
i
love
to
hear
you
laughing
i
ca
imagine
anything
more
but
the
truth
was
and
they
both
knew
it
she
was
always
laughing
it
was
really
a
habit
only
ever
since
the
day
they
met
ever
since
that
very
first
moment
for
some
strange
reason
that
reggie
wished
to
god
he
understood
anne
had
laughed
at
him
why
it
did
matter
where
they
were
or
what
they
were
talking
about
they
might
begin
by
being
as
serious
as
possible
dead
serious
at
any
rate
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
but
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
anne
would
glance
at
him
and
a
little
quick
quiver
passed
over
her
face
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
danced
and
she
began
laughing
another
queer
thing
about
it
was
reggie
had
an
idea
she
did
herself
know
why
she
laughed
he
had
seen
her
turn
away
frown
suck
in
her
cheeks
press
her
hands
together
but
it
was
no
use
the
long
soft
peal
sounded
even
while
she
cried
i
do
know
why
i
it
was
a
mystery
now
she
tucked
the
handkerchief
away
do
sit
down
said
she
and
smoke
wo
you
there
are
cigarettes
in
that
little
box
beside
you
i
have
one
he
lighted
a
match
for
her
and
as
she
bent
forward
he
saw
the
tiny
flame
glow
in
the
pearl
ring
she
wore
it
is
that
you
going
is
it
said
anne
yes
as
ever
was
said
reggie
and
he
blew
a
little
fan
of
smoke
why
on
earth
was
he
so
nervous
nervous
was
the
word
for
it
it
it
frightfully
hard
to
believe
he
added
yes
is
it
said
anne
softly
and
she
leaned
forward
and
rolled
the
point
of
her
cigarette
round
the
green
how
beautiful
she
looked
like
that
simply
beautiful
and
she
was
so
small
in
that
immense
chair
reginald
heart
swelled
with
tenderness
but
it
was
her
voice
her
soft
voice
that
made
him
tremble
i
feel
you
been
here
for
years
she
said
reginald
took
a
deep
breath
of
his
cigarette
it
ghastly
this
idea
of
going
back
he
said
sounded
from
the
quiet
but
you
fond
of
being
out
there
are
you
said
anne
she
hooked
her
finger
through
her
pearl
necklace
father
was
saying
only
the
other
night
how
lucky
he
thought
you
were
to
have
a
life
of
your
and
she
looked
up
at
him
reginald
smile
was
rather
wan
i
do
feel
fearfully
lucky
he
said
lightly
came
again
and
anne
murmured
you
mean
oh
it
is
the
loneliness
i
care
about
said
reginald
and
he
stumped
his
cigarette
savagely
on
the
green
i
could
stand
any
amount
of
it
used
to
like
it
even
it
the
idea
of
suddenly
to
his
horror
he
felt
himself
blushing
anne
jumped
up
come
and
say
to
my
doves
she
said
been
moved
to
the
side
veranda
you
do
like
doves
do
you
reggie
awfully
said
reggie
so
fervently
that
as
he
opened
the
french
window
for
her
and
stood
to
one
side
anne
ran
forward
and
laughed
at
the
doves
instead
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
over
the
fine
red
sand
on
the
floor
of
the
dove
house
walked
the
two
doves
one
was
always
in
front
of
the
other
one
ran
forward
uttering
a
little
cry
and
the
other
followed
solemnly
bowing
and
bowing
you
see
explained
anne
the
one
in
front
dove
she
looks
at
dove
and
gives
that
little
laugh
and
runs
forward
and
he
follows
her
bowing
and
bowing
and
that
makes
her
laugh
again
away
she
runs
and
after
her
cried
anne
and
she
sat
back
on
her
heels
comes
poor
dove
bowing
and
bowing
and
that
their
whole
life
they
never
do
anything
else
you
she
got
up
and
took
some
yellow
grains
out
of
a
bag
on
the
roof
of
the
dove
house
when
you
think
of
them
out
in
rhodesia
reggie
you
can
be
sure
that
is
what
they
will
be
doing
reggie
gave
no
sign
of
having
seen
the
doves
or
of
having
heard
a
word
for
the
moment
he
was
conscious
only
of
the
immense
effort
it
took
to
tear
his
secret
out
of
himself
and
offer
it
to
anne
anne
do
you
think
you
could
ever
care
for
me
it
was
done
it
was
over
and
in
the
little
pause
that
followed
reginald
saw
the
garden
open
to
the
light
the
blue
quivering
sky
the
flutter
of
leaves
on
the
veranda
poles
and
anne
turning
over
the
grains
of
maize
on
her
palm
with
one
finger
then
slowly
she
shut
her
hand
and
the
new
world
faded
as
she
murmured
slowly
no
never
in
that
but
he
had
scarcely
time
to
feel
anything
before
she
walked
quickly
away
and
he
followed
her
down
the
steps
along
the
garden
path
under
the
pink
rose
arches
across
the
lawn
there
with
the
gay
herbaceous
border
behind
her
anne
faced
reginald
it
is
that
i
not
awfully
fond
of
you
she
said
i
am
but
her
eyes
widened
not
in
the
way
a
quiver
passed
over
her
face
one
ought
to
be
fond
of
her
lips
parted
and
she
could
stop
herself
she
began
laughing
there
you
see
you
see
she
cried
your
check
even
at
this
moment
when
one
would
think
one
really
would
be
solemn
your
tie
reminds
me
fearfully
of
the
that
cats
wear
in
pictures
oh
please
forgive
me
for
being
so
horrid
please
reggie
caught
hold
of
her
little
warm
hand
there
no
question
of
forgiving
you
he
said
quickly
how
could
there
be
and
i
do
believe
i
know
why
i
make
you
laugh
it
because
you
so
far
above
me
in
every
way
that
i
am
somehow
ridiculous
i
see
that
anne
but
if
i
were
to
no
anne
squeezed
his
hand
hard
it
not
that
that
all
wrong
i
not
far
above
you
at
all
you
much
better
than
i
am
marvellously
unselfish
and
and
kind
and
simple
i
none
of
those
things
you
do
know
me
i
the
most
awful
character
said
anne
please
do
interrupt
and
besides
that
not
the
point
the
point
is
she
shook
her
head
i
could
possibly
marry
a
man
i
laughed
at
surely
you
see
that
the
man
i
marry
breathed
anne
softly
she
broke
off
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
looking
at
reggie
she
smiled
strangely
dreamily
the
man
i
marry
and
it
seemed
to
reggie
that
a
tall
handsome
brilliant
stranger
stepped
in
front
of
him
and
took
his
place
the
kind
of
man
that
anne
and
he
had
seen
often
at
the
theatre
walking
on
to
the
stage
from
nowhere
without
a
word
catching
the
heroine
in
his
arms
and
after
one
long
tremendous
look
carrying
her
off
to
anywhere
reggie
bowed
to
his
vision
yes
i
see
he
said
huskily
do
you
said
anne
oh
i
do
hope
you
do
because
i
feel
so
horrid
about
it
it
so
hard
to
explain
you
know
i
never
she
stopped
reggie
looked
at
her
she
was
smiling
is
it
funny
she
said
i
can
say
anything
to
you
i
always
have
been
able
to
from
the
very
he
tried
to
smile
to
say
i
she
went
on
i
never
known
any
one
i
like
as
much
as
i
like
you
i
never
felt
so
happy
with
any
one
but
i
sure
it
not
what
people
and
what
books
mean
when
they
talk
about
love
do
you
understand
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
horrid
i
feel
but
we
be
like
like
and
that
did
it
that
seemed
to
reginald
final
and
so
terribly
true
that
he
could
hardly
bear
it
do
drive
it
home
he
said
and
he
turned
away
from
anne
and
looked
across
the
lawn
there
was
the
gardener
cottage
with
the
dark
beside
it
a
wet
blue
thumb
of
transparent
smoke
hung
above
the
chimney
it
did
look
real
how
his
throat
ached
could
he
speak
he
had
a
shot
i
must
be
getting
along
home
he
croaked
and
he
began
walking
across
the
lawn
but
anne
ran
after
him
no
do
you
ca
go
yet
she
said
imploringly
you
ca
possibly
go
away
feeling
like
and
she
stared
up
at
him
frowning
biting
her
lip
oh
that
all
right
said
reggie
giving
himself
a
shake
i
i
and
he
waved
his
hand
as
much
to
say
get
over
but
this
is
awful
said
anne
she
clasped
her
hands
and
stood
in
front
of
him
surely
you
do
see
how
fatal
it
would
be
for
us
to
marry
you
oh
quite
quite
said
reggie
looking
at
her
with
haggard
eyes
how
wrong
how
wicked
feeling
as
i
do
i
mean
it
all
very
well
for
and
dove
but
imagine
that
in
real
life
imagine
it
oh
absolutely
said
reggie
and
he
started
to
walk
on
but
again
anne
stopped
him
she
tugged
at
his
sleeve
and
to
his
astonishment
this
time
instead
of
laughing
she
looked
like
a
little
girl
who
was
going
to
cry
then
why
if
you
understand
are
you
so
she
wailed
why
do
you
mind
so
fearfully
why
do
you
look
so
reggie
gulped
and
again
he
waved
something
away
i
ca
help
it
he
said
i
had
a
blow
if
i
cut
off
now
i
be
able
to
how
can
you
talk
of
cutting
off
now
said
anne
scornfully
she
stamped
her
foot
at
reggie
she
was
crimson
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
i
let
you
go
until
i
know
for
certain
that
you
are
just
as
happy
as
you
were
before
you
asked
me
to
marry
you
surely
you
must
see
that
it
so
but
it
did
not
seem
at
all
simple
to
reginald
it
seemed
impossibly
difficult
even
if
i
ca
marry
you
how
can
i
know
that
you
all
that
way
away
with
only
that
awful
mother
to
write
to
and
that
miserable
and
that
it
all
my
fault
it
not
your
fault
do
think
that
it
just
reggie
took
her
hand
off
his
sleeve
and
kissed
it
do
pity
me
dear
little
anne
he
said
gently
and
this
time
he
nearly
ran
under
the
pink
arches
along
the
garden
path
sounded
from
the
veranda
reggie
reggie
from
the
garden
he
stopped
he
turned
but
when
she
saw
his
timid
puzzled
look
she
gave
a
little
laugh
come
back
dove
said
anne
and
reginald
came
slowly
across
the
lawn
the
young
girl
in
her
blue
dress
with
her
cheeks
lightly
flushed
her
blue
blue
eyes
and
her
gold
curls
pinned
up
as
though
for
the
first
time
pinned
up
to
be
out
of
the
way
for
her
flight
raddick
daughter
might
have
just
dropped
from
this
radiant
heaven
raddick
timid
faintly
astonished
but
deeply
admiring
glance
looked
as
if
she
believed
it
too
but
the
daughter
did
appear
any
too
pleased
why
should
she
to
have
alighted
on
the
steps
of
the
casino
indeed
she
was
bored
bored
as
though
heaven
had
been
full
of
casinos
with
snuffy
old
saints
for
croupiers
and
crowns
to
play
with
you
do
mind
taking
hennie
said
raddick
sure
you
do
there
the
car
and
you
have
tea
and
we
be
back
here
on
this
step
right
here
in
an
hour
you
see
i
want
her
to
go
in
she
not
been
before
and
it
worth
seeing
i
feel
it
would
be
fair
to
oh
shut
up
mother
said
she
wearily
come
along
do
talk
so
much
and
your
bag
open
you
be
losing
all
your
money
i
sorry
darling
said
raddick
oh
do
come
in
i
want
to
make
money
said
the
impatient
voice
all
jolly
well
for
you
but
i
broke
here
take
fifty
francs
darling
take
a
hundred
i
saw
raddick
pressing
notes
into
her
hand
as
they
passed
through
the
swing
doors
hennie
and
i
stood
on
the
steps
a
minute
watching
the
people
he
had
a
very
broad
delighted
smile
i
say
he
cried
there
an
english
bulldog
are
they
allowed
to
take
dogs
in
there
no
they
he
a
ripping
chap
is
he
i
wish
i
had
one
they
such
fun
they
frighten
people
so
and
they
never
fierce
with
their
the
people
they
belong
suddenly
he
squeezed
my
arm
i
say
do
look
at
that
old
woman
who
is
she
why
does
she
look
like
that
is
she
a
gambler
the
ancient
withered
creature
wearing
a
green
satin
dress
a
black
velvet
cloak
and
a
white
hat
with
purple
feathers
jerked
slowly
slowly
up
the
steps
as
though
she
were
being
drawn
up
on
wires
she
stared
in
front
of
her
she
was
laughing
and
nodding
and
cackling
to
herself
her
claws
clutched
round
what
looked
like
a
dirty
but
just
at
that
moment
there
was
raddick
again
with
her
and
another
lady
hovering
in
the
background
raddick
rushed
at
me
she
was
brightly
flushed
gay
a
different
creature
she
was
like
a
woman
who
is
saying
to
her
friends
on
the
station
platform
with
not
a
minute
to
spare
before
the
train
starts
oh
you
here
still
is
that
lucky
you
not
gone
is
that
fine
i
had
the
most
dreadful
time
with
her
and
she
waved
to
her
daughter
who
stood
absolutely
still
disdainful
looking
down
twiddling
her
foot
on
the
step
miles
away
they
wo
let
her
in
i
swore
she
was
but
they
wo
believe
me
i
showed
the
man
my
purse
i
did
dare
to
do
more
but
it
was
no
use
he
simply
scoffed
and
now
i
just
met
macewen
from
new
york
and
she
just
won
thirteen
thousand
in
the
salle
privee
and
she
wants
me
to
go
back
with
her
while
the
luck
lasts
of
course
i
ca
leave
her
but
if
you
at
that
she
looked
up
she
simply
withered
her
mother
why
you
leave
me
she
said
furiously
what
utter
rot
how
dare
you
make
a
scene
like
this
this
is
the
last
time
i
come
out
with
you
you
really
are
too
awful
for
she
looked
her
mother
up
and
down
calm
yourself
she
said
superbly
raddick
was
desperate
just
desperate
she
was
wild
to
go
back
with
macewen
but
at
the
same
time
i
seized
my
courage
would
you
do
you
care
to
come
to
tea
with
us
yes
yes
she
be
delighted
that
just
what
i
wanted
is
it
darling
macewen
i
be
back
here
in
an
hour
or
less
i
dashed
up
the
steps
i
saw
her
bag
was
open
again
so
we
three
were
left
but
really
it
was
my
fault
hennie
looked
crushed
to
the
earth
too
when
the
car
was
there
she
wrapped
her
dark
coat
round
her
to
escape
contamination
even
her
little
feet
looked
as
though
they
scorned
to
carry
her
down
the
steps
to
us
i
am
so
awfully
sorry
i
murmured
as
the
car
started
oh
i
do
mind
said
she
i
do
want
to
look
who
would
if
they
were
seventeen
it
and
she
gave
a
faint
shudder
the
stupidity
i
loathe
and
being
stared
at
by
old
fat
men
beasts
hennie
gave
her
a
quick
look
and
then
peered
out
of
the
window
we
drew
up
before
an
immense
palace
of
marble
with
outside
the
doors
in
tubs
would
you
care
to
go
in
i
suggested
she
hesitated
glanced
bit
her
lip
and
resigned
herself
oh
well
there
seems
nowhere
else
said
she
get
out
i
went
first
to
find
the
table
of
course
she
followed
but
the
worst
of
it
was
having
her
little
brother
who
was
only
twelve
with
us
that
was
the
last
final
straw
having
that
child
trailing
at
her
heels
there
was
one
table
it
had
pink
carnations
and
pink
plates
with
little
blue
for
sails
shall
we
sit
here
she
put
her
hand
wearily
on
the
back
of
a
white
wicker
chair
we
may
as
well
why
not
said
she
hennie
squeezed
past
her
and
wriggled
on
to
a
stool
at
the
end
he
felt
awfully
out
of
it
she
did
even
take
her
gloves
off
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
drummed
on
the
table
when
a
faint
violin
sounded
she
winced
and
bit
her
lip
again
silence
the
waitress
appeared
i
hardly
dared
to
ask
her
tea
coffee
china
tea
or
iced
tea
with
lemon
really
she
did
mind
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
she
did
really
want
anything
hennie
whispered
chocolate
but
just
as
the
waitress
turned
away
she
cried
out
carelessly
oh
you
may
as
well
bring
me
a
chocolate
while
we
waited
she
took
out
a
little
gold
with
a
mirror
in
the
lid
shook
the
poor
little
puff
as
though
she
loathed
it
and
dabbed
her
lovely
nose
hennie
she
said
take
those
flowers
she
pointed
with
her
puff
to
the
carnations
and
i
heard
her
murmur
i
ca
bear
flowers
on
a
they
had
evidently
been
giving
her
intense
pain
for
she
positively
closed
her
eyes
as
i
moved
them
away
the
waitress
came
back
with
the
chocolate
and
the
tea
she
put
the
big
frothing
cups
before
them
and
pushed
across
my
clear
glass
hennie
buried
his
nose
emerged
with
for
one
dreadful
moment
a
little
trembling
blob
of
cream
on
the
tip
but
he
hastily
wiped
it
off
like
a
little
gentleman
i
wondered
if
i
should
dare
draw
her
attention
to
her
cup
she
did
notice
it
did
see
it
until
suddenly
quite
by
chance
she
took
a
sip
i
watched
anxiously
she
faintly
shuddered
dreadfully
sweet
said
she
a
tiny
boy
with
a
head
like
a
raisin
and
a
chocolate
body
came
round
with
a
tray
of
pastries
row
upon
row
of
little
freaks
little
inspirations
little
melting
dreams
he
offered
them
to
her
oh
not
at
all
hungry
take
them
he
offered
them
to
hennie
hennie
gave
me
a
swift
look
it
must
have
been
satisfactory
for
he
took
a
chocolate
cream
a
coffee
eclair
a
meringue
stuffed
with
chestnut
and
a
tiny
horn
filled
with
fresh
strawberries
she
could
hardly
bear
to
watch
him
but
just
as
the
boy
swerved
away
she
held
up
her
plate
oh
well
give
me
one
said
she
the
silver
tongs
dropped
one
two
three
and
a
cherry
tartlet
i
know
why
you
giving
me
all
these
she
said
and
nearly
smiled
i
sha
eat
them
i
could
i
felt
much
more
comfortable
i
sipped
my
tea
leaned
back
and
even
asked
if
i
might
smoke
at
that
she
paused
the
fork
in
her
hand
opened
her
eyes
and
really
did
smile
of
course
said
she
i
always
expect
people
but
at
that
moment
a
tragedy
happened
to
hennie
he
speared
his
pastry
horn
too
hard
and
it
flew
in
two
and
one
half
spilled
on
the
table
ghastly
affair
he
turned
crimson
even
his
ears
flared
and
one
ashamed
hand
crept
across
the
table
to
take
what
was
left
of
the
body
away
you
utter
little
beast
said
she
good
heavens
i
had
to
fly
to
the
rescue
i
cried
hastily
will
you
be
abroad
long
but
she
had
already
forgotten
hennie
i
was
forgotten
too
she
was
trying
to
remember
something
she
was
miles
away
i
do
know
she
said
slowly
from
that
far
place
i
suppose
you
prefer
it
to
london
it
more
more
when
i
did
go
on
she
came
back
and
looked
at
me
very
puzzled
more
enfin
gayer
i
cried
waving
my
cigarette
but
that
took
a
whole
cake
to
consider
even
then
oh
well
that
depends
was
all
she
could
safely
say
hennie
had
finished
he
was
still
very
warm
i
seized
the
butterfly
list
off
the
table
i
say
what
about
an
ice
hennie
what
about
tangerine
and
ginger
no
something
cooler
what
about
a
fresh
pineapple
cream
hennie
strongly
approved
the
waitress
had
her
eye
on
us
the
order
was
taken
when
she
looked
up
from
her
crumbs
did
you
say
tangerine
and
ginger
i
like
ginger
you
can
bring
me
and
then
quickly
i
wish
that
orchestra
would
play
things
from
the
year
one
we
were
dancing
to
that
all
last
christmas
it
too
sickening
but
it
was
a
charming
air
now
that
i
noticed
it
it
warmed
me
i
think
this
is
rather
a
nice
place
do
you
hennie
i
said
hennie
said
ripping
he
meant
to
say
it
very
low
but
it
came
out
very
high
in
a
kind
of
squeak
nice
this
place
nice
for
the
first
time
she
stared
about
her
trying
to
see
what
there
was
she
blinked
her
lovely
eyes
wondered
a
very
elderly
man
stared
back
at
her
through
a
monocle
on
a
black
ribbon
but
him
she
simply
could
see
there
was
a
hole
in
the
air
where
he
was
she
looked
through
and
through
him
finally
the
little
flat
spoons
lay
still
on
the
glass
plates
hennie
looked
rather
exhausted
but
she
pulled
on
her
white
gloves
again
she
had
some
trouble
with
her
diamond
it
got
in
her
way
she
tugged
at
it
tried
to
break
the
stupid
little
thing
it
would
break
finally
she
had
to
drag
her
glove
over
i
saw
after
that
she
stand
this
place
a
moment
longer
and
indeed
she
jumped
up
and
turned
away
while
i
went
through
the
vulgar
act
of
paying
for
the
tea
and
then
we
were
outside
again
it
had
grown
dusky
the
sky
was
sprinkled
with
small
stars
the
big
lamps
glowed
while
we
waited
for
the
car
to
come
up
she
stood
on
the
step
just
as
before
twiddling
her
foot
looking
down
hennie
bounded
forward
to
open
the
door
and
she
got
in
and
sank
back
with
oh
such
a
sigh
tell
him
she
gasped
to
drive
as
fast
as
he
hennie
grinned
at
his
friend
the
chauffeur
allie
veet
said
he
then
he
composed
himself
and
sat
on
the
small
seat
facing
us
the
gold
came
out
again
again
the
poor
little
puff
was
shaken
again
there
was
that
swift
glance
between
her
and
the
mirror
we
tore
through
the
town
like
a
pair
of
scissors
tearing
through
brocade
hennie
had
great
difficulty
not
to
look
as
though
he
were
hanging
on
to
something
and
when
we
reached
the
casino
of
course
raddick
was
there
there
was
a
sign
of
her
on
the
steps
not
a
sign
will
you
stay
in
the
car
while
i
go
and
look
but
no
she
would
do
that
good
heavens
no
hennie
could
stay
she
could
bear
sitting
in
a
car
she
wait
on
the
steps
but
i
scarcely
like
to
leave
you
i
murmured
i
very
much
rather
not
leave
you
at
that
she
threw
back
her
coat
she
turned
and
faced
me
her
lips
parted
good
heavens
why
i
i
do
mind
it
a
bit
i
i
like
and
suddenly
her
cheeks
crimsoned
her
eyes
grew
dark
for
a
moment
i
thought
she
was
going
to
cry
l
let
me
please
she
stammered
in
a
warm
eager
voice
i
like
it
i
love
waiting
really
really
i
do
i
always
waiting
in
all
kinds
of
places
her
dark
coat
fell
open
and
her
white
throat
all
her
soft
young
body
in
the
blue
dress
was
like
a
flower
that
is
just
emerging
from
its
dark
bud
life
of
ma
parker
when
the
literary
gentleman
whose
flat
old
ma
parker
cleaned
every
tuesday
opened
the
door
to
her
that
morning
he
asked
after
her
grandson
ma
parker
stood
on
the
doormat
inside
the
dark
little
hall
and
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
help
her
gentleman
shut
the
door
before
she
replied
we
buried
yesterday
sir
she
said
quietly
oh
dear
me
i
sorry
to
hear
that
said
the
literary
gentleman
in
a
shocked
tone
he
was
in
the
middle
of
his
breakfast
he
wore
a
very
shabby
and
carried
a
crumpled
newspaper
in
one
hand
but
he
felt
awkward
he
could
hardly
go
back
to
the
warm
without
saying
something
something
more
then
because
these
people
set
such
store
by
funerals
he
said
kindly
i
hope
the
funeral
went
off
all
beg
parding
sir
said
old
ma
parker
huskily
poor
old
bird
she
did
look
dashed
i
hope
the
funeral
was
a
a
success
said
he
ma
parker
gave
no
answer
she
bent
her
head
and
hobbled
off
to
the
kitchen
clasping
the
old
fish
bag
that
held
her
cleaning
things
and
an
apron
and
a
pair
of
felt
shoes
the
literary
gentleman
raised
his
eyebrows
and
went
back
to
his
breakfast
overcome
i
suppose
he
said
aloud
helping
himself
to
the
marmalade
ma
parker
drew
the
two
jetty
spears
out
of
her
toque
and
hung
it
behind
the
door
she
unhooked
her
worn
jacket
and
hung
that
up
too
then
she
tied
her
apron
and
sat
down
to
take
off
her
boots
to
take
off
her
boots
or
to
put
them
on
was
an
agony
to
her
but
it
had
been
an
agony
for
years
in
fact
she
was
so
accustomed
to
the
pain
that
her
face
was
drawn
and
screwed
up
ready
for
the
twinge
before
she
so
much
as
untied
the
laces
that
over
she
sat
back
with
a
sigh
and
softly
rubbed
her
knees
gran
gran
her
little
grandson
stood
on
her
lap
in
his
button
boots
he
just
come
in
from
playing
in
the
street
look
what
a
state
you
made
your
gran
skirt
into
you
wicked
boy
but
he
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
rubbed
his
cheek
against
hers
gran
gi
us
a
penny
he
coaxed
be
off
with
you
gran
ai
got
no
yes
you
no
i
yes
you
gi
us
one
already
she
was
feeling
for
the
old
squashed
black
leather
purse
well
what
you
give
your
gran
he
gave
a
shy
little
laugh
and
pressed
closer
she
felt
his
eyelid
quivering
against
her
cheek
i
ai
got
nothing
he
murmured
the
old
woman
sprang
up
seized
the
iron
kettle
off
the
gas
stove
and
took
it
over
to
the
sink
the
noise
of
the
water
drumming
in
the
kettle
deadened
her
pain
it
seemed
she
filled
the
pail
too
and
the
bowl
it
would
take
a
whole
book
to
describe
the
state
of
that
kitchen
during
the
week
the
literary
gentleman
did
for
himself
that
is
to
say
he
emptied
the
tea
leaves
now
and
again
into
a
jam
jar
set
aside
for
that
purpose
and
if
he
ran
out
of
clean
forks
he
wiped
over
one
or
two
on
the
roller
towel
otherwise
as
he
explained
to
his
friends
his
system
was
quite
simple
and
he
could
understand
why
people
made
all
this
fuss
about
housekeeping
you
simply
dirty
everything
you
got
get
a
hag
in
once
a
week
to
clean
up
and
the
thing
the
result
looked
like
a
gigantic
dustbin
even
the
floor
was
littered
with
toast
crusts
envelopes
cigarette
ends
but
ma
parker
bore
him
no
grudge
she
pitied
the
poor
young
gentleman
for
having
no
one
to
look
after
him
out
of
the
smudgy
little
window
you
could
see
an
immense
expanse
of
sky
and
whenever
there
were
clouds
they
looked
very
worn
old
clouds
frayed
at
the
edges
with
holes
in
them
or
dark
stains
like
tea
while
the
water
was
heating
ma
parker
began
sweeping
the
floor
yes
she
thought
as
the
broom
knocked
what
with
one
thing
and
another
had
my
share
i
had
a
hard
even
the
neighbours
said
that
of
her
many
a
time
hobbling
home
with
her
fish
bag
she
heard
them
waiting
at
the
corner
or
leaning
over
the
area
railings
say
among
themselves
she
had
a
hard
life
has
ma
and
it
was
so
true
she
was
in
the
least
proud
of
it
it
was
just
as
if
you
were
to
say
she
lived
in
the
at
number
a
hard
life
at
sixteen
she
left
stratford
and
come
up
to
london
as
yes
she
was
born
in
shakespeare
sir
no
people
were
always
arsking
her
about
him
but
she
never
heard
his
name
until
she
saw
it
on
the
theatres
nothing
remained
of
stratford
except
that
sitting
in
the
of
a
evening
you
could
see
the
stars
through
the
chimley
and
mother
always
side
of
bacon
from
the
and
there
was
something
a
bush
there
was
at
the
front
door
that
smelt
ever
so
nice
but
the
bush
was
very
vague
she
only
remembered
it
once
or
twice
in
the
hospital
when
she
been
taken
bad
that
was
a
dreadful
place
her
first
place
she
was
never
allowed
out
she
never
went
upstairs
except
for
prayers
morning
and
evening
it
was
a
fair
cellar
and
the
cook
was
a
cruel
woman
she
used
to
snatch
away
her
letters
from
home
before
she
read
them
and
throw
them
in
the
range
because
they
made
her
dreamy
and
the
beedles
would
you
believe
it
until
she
came
to
london
she
never
seen
a
black
beedle
here
ma
always
gave
a
little
laugh
as
though
not
to
have
seen
a
black
beedle
well
it
was
as
if
to
say
you
never
seen
your
own
feet
when
that
family
was
sold
up
she
went
as
help
to
a
doctor
house
and
after
two
years
there
on
the
run
from
morning
till
night
she
married
her
husband
he
was
a
baker
a
baker
parker
the
literary
gentleman
would
say
for
occasionally
he
laid
aside
his
tomes
and
lent
an
ear
at
least
to
this
product
called
life
it
must
be
rather
nice
to
be
married
to
a
baker
parker
did
look
so
sure
such
a
clean
trade
said
the
gentleman
parker
did
look
convinced
and
did
you
like
handing
the
new
loaves
to
the
customers
well
sir
said
parker
i
was
in
the
shop
above
a
great
deal
we
had
thirteen
little
ones
and
buried
seven
of
them
if
it
was
the
it
was
the
infirmary
you
might
say
you
might
indeed
parker
said
the
gentleman
shuddering
and
taking
up
his
pen
again
yes
seven
had
gone
and
while
the
six
were
still
small
her
husband
was
taken
ill
with
consumption
it
was
flour
on
the
lungs
the
doctor
told
her
at
the
time
her
husband
sat
up
in
bed
with
his
shirt
pulled
over
his
head
and
the
doctor
finger
drew
a
circle
on
his
back
now
if
we
were
to
cut
him
open
here
parker
said
the
doctor
you
find
his
lungs
with
white
powder
breathe
my
good
fellow
and
parker
never
knew
for
certain
whether
she
saw
or
whether
she
fancied
she
saw
a
great
fan
of
white
dust
come
out
of
her
poor
dead
husband
lips
but
the
struggle
she
had
to
bring
up
those
six
little
children
and
keep
herself
to
herself
terrible
it
had
been
then
just
when
they
were
old
enough
to
go
to
school
her
husband
sister
came
to
stop
with
them
to
help
things
along
and
she
had
been
there
more
than
two
months
when
she
fell
down
a
flight
of
steps
and
hurt
her
spine
and
for
five
years
ma
parker
had
another
baby
and
such
a
one
for
crying
to
look
after
then
young
maudie
went
wrong
and
took
her
sister
alice
with
her
the
two
boys
emigrated
and
young
jim
went
to
india
with
the
army
and
ethel
the
youngest
married
a
little
waiter
who
died
of
ulcers
the
year
little
lennie
was
born
and
now
little
lennie
my
grandson
the
piles
of
dirty
cups
dirty
dishes
were
washed
and
dried
the
knives
were
cleaned
with
a
piece
of
potato
and
finished
off
with
a
piece
of
cork
the
table
was
scrubbed
and
the
dresser
and
the
sink
that
had
sardine
tails
swimming
in
it
he
never
been
a
strong
child
never
from
the
first
he
been
one
of
those
fair
babies
that
everybody
took
for
a
girl
silvery
fair
curls
he
had
blue
eyes
and
a
little
freckle
like
a
diamond
on
one
side
of
his
nose
the
trouble
she
and
ethel
had
had
to
rear
that
child
the
things
out
of
the
newspapers
they
tried
him
with
every
sunday
morning
ethel
would
read
aloud
while
ma
parker
did
her
washing
dear
sir
just
a
line
to
let
you
know
my
little
myrtil
was
laid
out
for
dead
after
four
bottils
gained
lbs
in
weeks
and
is
still
putting
it
and
then
the
of
ink
would
come
off
the
dresser
and
the
letter
would
be
written
and
ma
would
buy
a
postal
order
on
her
way
to
work
next
morning
but
it
was
no
use
nothing
made
little
lennie
put
it
on
taking
him
to
the
cemetery
even
never
gave
him
a
colour
a
nice
in
the
bus
never
improved
his
appetite
but
he
was
gran
boy
from
the
first
whose
boy
are
you
said
old
ma
parker
straightening
up
from
the
stove
and
going
over
to
the
smudgy
window
and
a
little
voice
so
warm
so
close
it
half
stifled
her
it
seemed
to
be
in
her
breast
under
her
heart
laughed
out
and
said
i
gran
boy
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sound
of
steps
and
the
literary
gentleman
appeared
dressed
for
walking
oh
parker
i
going
very
good
and
you
find
your
in
the
tray
of
the
thank
you
oh
by
the
way
parker
said
the
literary
gentleman
quickly
you
did
throw
away
any
cocoa
last
time
you
were
here
did
you
no
very
strange
i
could
have
sworn
i
left
a
teaspoonful
of
cocoa
in
the
he
broke
off
he
said
softly
and
firmly
always
tell
me
when
you
throw
things
away
wo
you
parker
and
he
walked
off
very
well
pleased
with
himself
convinced
in
fact
he
shown
parker
that
under
his
apparent
carelessness
he
was
as
vigilant
as
a
woman
the
door
banged
she
took
her
brushes
and
cloths
into
the
bedroom
but
when
she
began
to
make
the
bed
smoothing
tucking
patting
the
thought
of
little
lennie
was
unbearable
why
did
he
have
to
suffer
so
what
she
could
understand
why
should
a
little
angel
child
have
to
arsk
for
his
breath
and
fight
for
it
there
was
no
sense
in
making
a
child
suffer
like
that
from
lennie
little
box
of
a
chest
there
came
a
sound
as
though
something
was
boiling
there
was
a
great
lump
of
something
bubbling
in
his
chest
that
he
could
get
rid
of
when
he
coughed
the
sweat
sprang
out
on
his
head
his
eyes
bulged
his
hands
waved
and
the
great
lump
bubbled
as
a
potato
knocks
in
a
saucepan
but
what
was
more
awful
than
all
was
when
he
did
cough
he
sat
against
the
pillow
and
never
spoke
or
answered
or
even
made
as
if
he
heard
only
he
looked
offended
it
not
your
poor
old
gran
doing
it
my
lovey
said
old
ma
parker
patting
back
the
damp
hair
from
his
little
scarlet
ears
but
lennie
moved
his
head
and
edged
away
dreadfully
offended
with
her
he
looked
and
solemn
he
bent
his
head
and
looked
at
her
sideways
as
though
he
could
have
believed
it
of
his
gran
but
at
the
last
ma
parker
threw
the
counterpane
over
the
bed
no
she
simply
could
think
about
it
it
was
too
much
she
had
too
much
in
her
life
to
bear
she
borne
it
up
till
now
she
kept
herself
to
herself
and
never
once
had
she
been
seen
to
cry
never
by
a
living
soul
not
even
her
own
children
had
seen
ma
break
down
she
kept
a
proud
face
always
but
now
lennie
gone
what
had
she
she
had
nothing
he
was
all
she
got
from
life
and
now
he
was
took
too
why
must
it
all
have
happened
to
me
she
wondered
what
have
i
done
said
old
ma
parker
what
have
i
done
as
she
said
those
words
she
suddenly
let
fall
her
brush
she
found
herself
in
the
kitchen
her
misery
was
so
terrible
that
she
pinned
on
her
hat
put
on
her
jacket
and
walked
out
of
the
flat
like
a
person
in
a
dream
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
she
was
like
a
person
so
dazed
by
the
horror
of
what
has
happened
that
he
walks
away
anywhere
as
though
by
walking
away
he
could
escape
it
was
cold
in
the
street
there
was
a
wind
like
ice
people
went
flitting
by
very
fast
the
men
walked
like
scissors
the
women
trod
like
cats
and
nobody
knew
nobody
cared
even
if
she
broke
down
if
at
last
after
all
these
years
she
were
to
cry
she
find
herself
in
the
as
like
as
not
but
at
the
thought
of
crying
it
was
as
though
little
lennie
leapt
in
his
gran
arms
ah
that
what
she
wants
to
do
my
dove
gran
wants
to
cry
if
she
could
only
cry
now
cry
for
a
long
time
over
everything
beginning
with
her
first
place
and
the
cruel
cook
going
on
to
the
doctor
and
then
the
seven
little
ones
death
of
her
husband
the
children
leaving
her
and
all
the
years
of
misery
that
led
up
to
lennie
but
to
have
a
proper
cry
over
all
these
things
would
take
a
long
time
all
the
same
the
time
for
it
had
come
she
must
do
it
she
could
put
it
off
any
longer
she
could
wait
any
more
where
could
she
go
she
had
a
hard
life
has
ma
yes
a
hard
life
indeed
her
chin
began
to
tremble
there
was
no
time
to
lose
but
where
where
she
could
go
home
ethel
was
there
it
would
frighten
ethel
out
of
her
life
she
could
sit
on
a
bench
anywhere
people
would
come
arsking
her
questions
she
could
possibly
go
back
to
the
flat
she
had
no
right
to
cry
in
strangers
houses
if
she
sat
on
some
steps
a
policeman
would
speak
to
her
oh
was
there
anywhere
where
she
could
hide
and
keep
herself
to
herself
and
stay
as
long
as
she
liked
not
disturbing
anybody
and
nobody
worrying
her
was
there
anywhere
in
the
world
where
she
could
have
her
cry
out
at
last
ma
parker
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
icy
wind
blew
out
her
apron
into
a
balloon
and
now
it
began
to
rain
there
was
nowhere
marriage
a
la
mode
on
his
way
to
the
station
william
remembered
with
a
fresh
pang
of
disappointment
that
he
was
taking
nothing
down
to
the
kiddies
poor
little
chaps
it
was
hard
lines
on
them
their
first
words
always
were
as
they
ran
to
greet
him
what
have
you
got
for
me
daddy
and
he
had
nothing
he
would
have
to
buy
them
some
sweets
at
the
station
but
that
was
what
he
had
done
for
the
past
four
saturdays
their
faces
had
fallen
last
time
when
they
saw
the
same
old
boxes
produced
again
and
paddy
had
said
i
had
red
ribbing
on
mine
and
johnny
had
said
it
always
pink
on
mine
i
hate
but
what
was
william
to
do
the
affair
was
so
easily
settled
in
the
old
days
of
course
he
would
have
taken
a
taxi
off
to
a
decent
toyshop
and
chosen
them
something
in
five
minutes
but
nowadays
they
had
russian
toys
french
toys
serbian
toys
toys
from
god
knows
where
it
was
over
a
year
since
isabel
had
scrapped
the
old
donkeys
and
engines
and
so
on
because
they
were
so
dreadfully
sentimental
and
so
appallingly
bad
for
the
babies
sense
of
it
so
important
the
new
isabel
had
explained
that
they
should
like
the
right
things
from
the
very
beginning
it
saves
so
much
time
later
on
really
if
the
poor
pets
have
to
spend
their
infant
years
staring
at
these
horrors
one
can
imagine
them
growing
up
and
asking
to
be
taken
to
the
royal
and
she
spoke
as
though
a
visit
to
the
royal
academy
was
certain
immediate
death
to
any
one
well
i
do
know
said
william
slowly
when
i
was
their
age
i
used
to
go
to
bed
hugging
an
old
towel
with
a
knot
in
the
new
isabel
looked
at
him
her
eyes
narrowed
her
lips
apart
dear
william
i
sure
you
did
she
laughed
in
the
new
way
sweets
it
would
have
to
be
however
thought
william
gloomily
fishing
in
his
pocket
for
change
for
the
and
he
saw
the
kiddies
handing
the
boxes
round
they
were
awfully
generous
little
chaps
while
isabel
precious
friends
did
hesitate
to
help
themselves
what
about
fruit
william
hovered
before
a
stall
just
inside
the
station
what
about
a
melon
each
would
they
have
to
share
that
too
or
a
pineapple
for
pad
and
a
melon
for
johnny
isabel
friends
could
hardly
go
sneaking
up
to
the
nursery
at
the
children
all
the
same
as
he
bought
the
melon
william
had
a
horrible
vision
of
one
of
isabel
young
poets
lapping
up
a
slice
for
some
reason
behind
the
nursery
door
with
his
two
very
awkward
parcels
he
strode
off
to
his
train
the
platform
was
crowded
the
train
was
in
doors
banged
open
and
shut
there
came
such
a
loud
hissing
from
the
engine
that
people
looked
dazed
as
they
scurried
to
and
fro
william
made
straight
for
a
smoker
stowed
away
his
and
parcels
and
taking
a
huge
wad
of
papers
out
of
his
inner
pocket
he
flung
down
in
the
corner
and
began
to
read
our
client
moreover
is
positive
we
are
inclined
to
reconsider
in
the
event
of
ah
that
was
better
william
pressed
back
his
flattened
hair
and
stretched
his
legs
across
the
carriage
floor
the
familiar
dull
gnawing
in
his
breast
quietened
down
with
regard
to
our
decision
he
took
out
a
blue
pencil
and
scored
a
paragraph
slowly
two
men
came
in
stepped
across
him
and
made
for
the
farther
corner
a
young
fellow
swung
his
golf
clubs
into
the
rack
and
sat
down
opposite
the
train
gave
a
gentle
lurch
they
were
off
william
glanced
up
and
saw
the
hot
bright
station
slipping
away
a
girl
raced
along
by
the
carriages
there
was
something
strained
and
almost
desperate
in
the
way
she
waved
and
called
hysterical
thought
william
dully
then
a
greasy
workman
at
the
end
of
the
platform
grinned
at
the
passing
train
and
william
thought
a
filthy
life
and
went
back
to
his
papers
when
he
looked
up
again
there
were
fields
and
beasts
standing
for
shelter
under
the
dark
trees
a
wide
river
with
naked
children
splashing
in
the
shallows
glided
into
sight
and
was
gone
again
the
sky
shone
pale
and
one
bird
drifted
high
like
a
dark
fleck
in
a
jewel
we
have
examined
our
client
correspondence
files
the
last
sentence
he
had
read
echoed
in
his
mind
we
have
examined
william
hung
on
to
that
sentence
but
it
was
no
good
it
snapped
in
the
middle
and
the
fields
the
sky
the
sailing
bird
the
water
all
said
the
same
thing
happened
every
saturday
afternoon
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
meet
isabel
there
began
those
countless
imaginary
meetings
she
was
at
the
station
standing
just
a
little
apart
from
everybody
else
she
was
sitting
in
the
open
taxi
outside
she
was
at
the
garden
gate
walking
across
the
parched
grass
at
the
door
or
just
inside
the
hall
and
her
clear
light
voice
said
it
william
or
hillo
william
or
so
william
has
come
he
touched
her
cool
hand
her
cool
cheek
the
exquisite
freshness
of
isabel
when
he
had
been
a
little
boy
it
was
his
delight
to
run
into
the
garden
after
a
shower
of
rain
and
shake
the
over
him
isabel
was
that
sparkling
and
cool
and
he
was
still
that
little
boy
but
there
was
no
running
into
the
garden
now
no
laughing
and
shaking
the
dull
persistent
gnawing
in
his
breast
started
again
he
drew
up
his
legs
tossed
the
papers
aside
and
shut
his
eyes
what
is
it
isabel
what
is
it
he
said
tenderly
they
were
in
their
bedroom
in
the
new
house
isabel
sat
on
a
painted
stool
before
the
that
was
strewn
with
little
black
and
green
boxes
what
is
what
william
and
she
bent
forward
and
her
fine
light
hair
fell
over
her
cheeks
ah
you
know
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
he
felt
a
stranger
at
that
isabel
wheeled
round
quickly
and
faced
him
oh
william
she
cried
imploringly
and
she
held
up
the
please
please
do
be
so
dreadfully
stuffy
and
tragic
you
always
saying
or
looking
or
hinting
that
i
changed
just
because
i
got
to
know
really
congenial
people
and
go
about
more
and
am
frightfully
keen
on
on
everything
you
behave
as
though
i
isabel
tossed
back
her
hair
and
laughed
killed
our
love
or
something
it
so
awfully
absurd
she
bit
her
lip
and
it
so
maddening
william
even
this
new
house
and
the
servants
you
grudge
isabel
yes
yes
it
true
in
a
way
said
isabel
quickly
you
think
they
are
another
bad
sign
oh
i
know
you
do
i
feel
it
she
said
softly
every
time
you
come
up
the
stairs
but
we
could
have
gone
on
living
in
that
other
poky
little
hole
william
be
practical
at
least
why
there
was
enough
room
for
the
babies
no
it
was
true
every
morning
when
he
came
back
from
chambers
it
was
to
find
the
babies
with
isabel
in
the
back
they
were
having
rides
on
the
leopard
skin
thrown
over
the
sofa
back
or
they
were
playing
shops
with
isabel
desk
for
a
counter
or
pad
was
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
rowing
away
for
dear
life
with
a
little
brass
fire
shovel
while
johnny
shot
at
pirates
with
the
tongs
every
evening
they
each
had
a
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
their
fat
old
nanny
yes
he
supposed
it
was
a
poky
little
house
a
little
white
house
with
blue
curtains
and
a
of
petunias
william
met
their
friends
at
the
door
with
seen
our
petunias
pretty
terrific
for
london
do
you
think
but
the
imbecile
thing
the
absolutely
extraordinary
thing
was
that
he
had
the
slightest
idea
that
isabel
was
as
happy
as
he
god
what
blindness
he
had
the
remotest
notion
in
those
days
that
she
really
hated
that
inconvenient
little
house
that
she
thought
the
fat
nanny
was
ruining
the
babies
that
she
was
desperately
lonely
pining
for
new
people
and
new
music
and
pictures
and
so
on
if
they
had
gone
to
that
studio
party
at
moira
morrison
if
moira
morrison
had
said
as
they
were
leaving
i
going
to
rescue
your
wife
selfish
man
she
like
an
exquisite
little
titania
if
isabel
had
gone
with
moira
to
paris
if
if
the
train
stopped
at
another
station
bettingford
good
heavens
be
there
in
ten
minutes
william
stuffed
that
papers
back
into
his
pockets
the
young
man
opposite
had
long
since
disappeared
now
the
other
two
got
out
the
late
afternoon
sun
shone
on
women
in
cotton
frocks
and
little
sunburnt
barefoot
children
it
blazed
on
a
silky
yellow
flower
with
coarse
leaves
which
sprawled
over
a
bank
of
rock
the
air
ruffling
through
the
window
smelled
of
the
sea
had
isabel
the
same
crowd
with
her
this
wondered
william
and
he
remembered
the
holidays
they
used
to
have
the
four
of
them
with
a
little
farm
girl
rose
to
look
after
the
babies
isabel
wore
a
jersey
and
her
hair
in
a
plait
she
looked
about
fourteen
lord
how
his
nose
used
to
peel
and
the
amount
they
ate
and
the
amount
they
slept
in
that
immense
feather
bed
with
their
feet
locked
together
william
help
a
grim
smile
as
he
thought
of
isabel
horror
if
she
knew
the
full
extent
of
his
sentimentality
hillo
william
she
was
at
the
station
after
all
standing
just
as
he
had
imagined
apart
from
the
others
and
william
heart
leapt
she
was
alone
hallo
isabel
william
stared
he
thought
she
looked
so
beautiful
that
he
had
to
say
something
you
look
very
do
i
said
isabel
i
do
feel
very
cool
come
along
your
horrid
old
train
is
late
the
taxi
she
put
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
as
they
passed
the
ticket
collector
we
all
come
to
meet
you
she
said
but
we
left
bobby
kane
at
the
sweet
shop
to
be
called
oh
said
william
it
was
all
he
could
say
for
the
moment
there
in
the
glare
waited
the
taxi
with
bill
hunt
and
dennis
green
sprawling
on
one
side
their
hats
tilted
over
their
faces
while
on
the
other
moira
morrison
in
a
bonnet
like
a
huge
strawberry
jumped
up
and
down
no
ice
no
ice
no
ice
she
shouted
gaily
and
dennis
chimed
in
from
under
his
hat
only
to
be
had
from
the
and
bill
hunt
emerging
added
with
whole
fish
in
oh
what
a
bore
wailed
isabel
and
she
explained
to
william
how
they
had
been
chasing
round
the
town
for
ice
while
she
waited
for
him
simply
everything
is
running
down
the
steep
cliffs
into
the
sea
beginning
with
the
we
shall
have
to
anoint
ourselves
with
butter
said
dennis
may
thy
head
william
lack
not
look
here
said
william
how
are
we
going
to
sit
i
better
get
up
by
the
no
bobby
kane
by
the
driver
said
isabel
you
to
sit
between
moira
and
the
taxi
started
what
have
you
got
in
those
mysterious
parcels
heads
said
bill
hunt
shuddering
beneath
his
hat
oh

isabel
sounded
very
pleased
wise
william
a
melon
and
a
pineapple
how
too
nice
no

bit
said
william
smiling
but
he
really
was
anxious
i
brought
them
down
for
the
oh
my
dear
isabel
laughed
and
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
they
be
rolling
in
agonies
if
they
were
to
eat
them
no
she
patted
his
hand
you
must
bring
them
something
next
time
i
refuse
to
part
with
my
cruel
isabel
do
let
me
smell
it
said
moira
she
flung
her
arms
across
william
appealingly
oh
the
strawberry
bonnet
fell
forward
she
sounded
quite
faint
a
lady
in
love
with
a
pineapple
said
dennis
as
the
taxi
drew
up
before
a
little
shop
with
a
striped
blind
out
came
bobby
kane
his
arms
full
of
little
packets
i
do
hope
they
be
good
i
chosen
them
because
of
the
colours
there
are
some
round
things
which
really
look
too
divine
and
just
look
at
this
nougat
he
cried
ecstatically
just
look
at
it
it
a
perfect
little
but
at
that
moment
the
shopman
appeared
oh
i
forgot
they
none
of
them
paid
for
said
bobby
looking
frightened
isabel
gave
the
shopman
a
note
and
bobby
was
radiant
again
hallo
william
i
sitting
by
the
and
bareheaded
all
in
white
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
to
the
shoulders
he
leapt
into
his
place
avanti
he
cried
after
tea
the
others
went
off
to
bathe
while
william
stayed
and
made
his
peace
with
the
kiddies
but
johnny
and
paddy
were
asleep
the
glow
had
paled
bats
were
flying
and
still
the
bathers
had
not
returned
as
william
wandered
downstairs
the
maid
crossed
the
hall
carrying
a
lamp
he
followed
her
into
the
it
was
a
long
room
coloured
yellow
on
the
wall
opposite
william
some
one
had
painted
a
young
man
over
with
very
wobbly
legs
offering
a
daisy
to
a
young
woman
who
had
one
very
short
arm
and
one
very
long
thin
one
over
the
chairs
and
sofa
there
hung
strips
of
black
material
covered
with
big
splashes
like
broken
eggs
and
everywhere
one
looked
there
seemed
to
be
an
full
of
cigarette
ends
william
sat
down
in
one
of
the
nowadays
when
one
felt
with
one
hand
down
the
sides
it
was
to
come
upon
a
sheep
with
three
legs
or
a
cow
that
had
lost
one
horn
or
a
very
fat
dove
out
of
the
noah
ark
one
fished
up
yet
another
little
book
of
poems
he
thought
of
the
wad
of
papers
in
his
pocket
but
he
was
too
hungry
and
tired
to
read
the
door
was
open
sounds
came
from
the
kitchen
the
servants
were
talking
as
if
they
were
alone
in
the
house
suddenly
there
came
a
loud
screech
of
laughter
and
an
equally
loud
sh
they
had
remembered
him
william
got
up
and
went
through
the
french
windows
into
the
garden
and
as
he
stood
there
in
the
shadow
he
heard
the
bathers
coming
up
the
sandy
road
their
voices
rang
through
the
quiet
i
think
its
up
to
moira
to
use
her
little
arts
and
a
tragic
moan
from
moira
we
ought
to
have
a
gramophone
for
the
weekends
that
played
maid
of
the
mountains
oh
no
oh
no
cried
isabel
voice
that
not
fair
to
william
be
nice
to
him
my
children
he
only
staying
until
leave
him
to
me
cried
bobby
kane
i
awfully
good
at
looking
after
the
gate
swung
open
and
shut
william
moved
on
the
terrace
they
had
seen
him
hallo
william
and
bobby
kane
flapping
his
towel
began
to
leap
and
pirouette
on
the
parched
lawn
pity
you
did
come
william
the
water
was
divine
and
we
all
went
to
a
little
pub
afterwards
and
had
sloe
the
others
had
reached
the
house
i
say
isabel
called
bobby
would
you
like
me
to
wear
my
nijinsky
dress
no
said
isabel
nobody
going
to
dress
we
all
starving
william
starving
too
come
along
mes
amis
let
begin
with
i
found
the
sardines
said
moira
and
she
ran
into
the
hall
holding
a
box
high
in
the
air
a
lady
with
a
box
of
sardines
said
dennis
gravely
well
william
and
how
london
asked
bill
hunt
drawing
the
cork
out
of
a
bottle
of
whisky
oh
london
not
much
changed
answered
william
good
old
london
said
bobby
very
hearty
spearing
a
sardine
but
a
moment
later
william
was
forgotten
moira
morrison
began
wondering
what
colour
one
legs
really
were
under
water
mine
are
the
palest
palest
mushroom
bill
and
dennis
ate
enormously
and
isabel
filled
glasses
and
changed
plates
and
found
matches
smiling
blissfully
at
one
moment
she
said
i
do
wish
bill
you
paint
paint
what
said
bill
loudly
stuffing
his
mouth
with
bread
us
said
isabel
round
the
table
it
would
be
so
fascinating
in
twenty
years
bill
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
chewed
light
wrong
he
said
rudely
far
too
much
yellow
and
went
on
eating
and
that
seemed
to
charm
isabel
too
but
after
supper
they
were
all
so
tired
they
could
do
nothing
but
yawn
until
it
was
late
enough
to
go
to
bed
it
was
not
until
william
was
waiting
for
his
taxi
the
next
afternoon
that
he
found
himself
alone
with
isabel
when
he
brought
his
down
into
the
hall
isabel
left
the
others
and
went
over
to
him
she
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
what
a
weight
she
said
and
she
gave
a
little
awkward
laugh
let
me
carry
it
to
the
no
why
should
you
said
william
of
course
not
give
it
to
oh
please
do
let
me
said
isabel
i
want
to
they
walked
together
silently
william
felt
there
was
nothing
to
say
now
there
said
isabel
triumphantly
setting
the
down
and
she
looked
anxiously
along
the
sandy
road
i
hardly
seem
to
have
seen
you
this
time
she
said
breathlessly
it
so
short
is
it
i
feel
you
only
just
come
next
time
the
taxi
came
into
sight
i
hope
they
look
after
you
properly
in
london
i
so
sorry
the
babies
have
been
out
all
day
but
miss
neil
had
arranged
it
they
hate
missing
you
poor
william
going
back
to
the
taxi
turned
she
gave
him
a
little
hurried
kiss
she
was
gone
fields
trees
hedges
streamed
by
they
shook
through
the
empty
little
town
ground
up
the
steep
pull
to
the
station
the
train
was
in
william
made
straight
for
a
smoker
flung
back
into
the
corner
but
this
time
he
let
the
papers
alone
he
folded
his
arms
against
the
dull
persistent
gnawing
and
began
in
his
mind
to
write
a
letter
to
isabel
the
post
was
late
as
usual
they
sat
outside
the
house
in
long
chairs
under
coloured
parasols
only
bobby
kane
lay
on
the
turf
at
feet
it
was
dull
stifling
the
day
drooped
like
a
flag
do
you
think
there
will
be
mondays
in
heaven
asked
bobby
childishly
and
dennis
murmured
heaven
will
be
one
long
but
isabel
could
help
wondering
what
had
happened
to
the
salmon
they
had
for
supper
last
night
she
had
meant
to
have
fish
mayonnaise
for
lunch
and
now
moira
was
asleep
sleeping
was
her
latest
discovery
it
so
wonderful
one
simply
shuts
one
eyes
that
all
it
so
when
the
old
ruddy
postman
came
beating
along
the
sandy
road
on
his
tricycle
one
felt
the
ought
to
have
been
oars
bill
hunt
put
down
his
book
letters
he
said
complacently
and
they
all
waited
but
heartless
postman
o
malignant
world
there
was
only
one
a
fat
one
for
isabel
not
even
a
paper
and
mine
only
from
william
said
isabel
mournfully
from
william
already
he
sending
you
back
your
marriage
lines
as
a
gentle
does
everybody
have
marriage
lines
i
thought
they
were
only
for
pages
and
pages
look
at
her
a
lady
reading
a
letter
said
dennis
my
darling
precious
pages
and
pages
there
were
as
isabel
read
on
her
feeling
of
astonishment
changed
to
a
stifled
feeling
what
on
earth
had
induced
william
how
extraordinary
it
was
what
could
have
made
him
she
felt
confused
more
and
more
excited
even
frightened
it
was
just
like
william
was
it
it
was
absurd
of
course
it
must
be
absurd
ridiculous
ha
ha
ha
oh
dear
what
was
she
to
do
isabel
flung
back
in
her
chair
and
laughed
till
she
could
stop
laughing
do
do
tell
us
said
the
others
you
must
tell
i
longing
to
gurgled
isabel
she
sat
up
gathered
the
letter
and
waved
it
at
them
gather
round
she
said
listen
it
too
marvellous
a
a
but
how
divine
darling
precious
but
she
had
hardly
begun
before
their
laughter
interrupted
her
go
on
isabel
it
it
the
most
marvellous
oh
do
go
on
isabel
god
forbid
my
darling
that
i
should
be
a
drag
on
your
oh
oh
oh
sh
sh
sh
and
isabel
went
on
when
she
reached
the
end
they
were
hysterical
bobby
rolled
on
the
turf
and
almost
sobbed
you
must
let
me
have
it
just
as
it
is
entire
for
my
new
book
said
dennis
firmly
i
shall
give
it
a
whole
oh
isabel
moaned
moira
that
wonderful
bit
about
holding
you
in
his
arms
i
always
thought
those
letters
in
divorce
cases
were
made
up
but
they
pale
before
let
me
hold
it
let
me
read
it
mine
own
self
said
bobby
kane
but
to
their
surprise
isabel
crushed
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
was
laughing
no
longer
she
glanced
quickly
at
them
all
she
looked
exhausted
no
not
just
now
not
just
now
she
stammered
and
before
they
could
recover
she
had
run
into
the
house
through
the
hall
up
the
stairs
into
her
bedroom
down
she
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
how
vile
odious
abominable
vulgar
muttered
isabel
she
pressed
her
eyes
with
her
knuckles
and
rocked
to
and
fro
and
again
she
saw
them
but
not
four
more
like
forty
laughing
sneering
jeering
stretching
out
their
hands
while
she
read
them
william
letter
oh
what
a
loathsome
thing
to
have
done
how
could
she
have
done
it
god
forbid
my
darling
that
i
should
be
a
drag
on
your
william
isabel
pressed
her
face
into
the
pillow
but
she
felt
that
even
the
grave
bedroom
knew
her
for
what
she
was
shallow
tinkling
vain
presently
from
the
garden
below
there
came
voices
isabel
we
all
going
for
a
bathe
do
come
come
thou
wife
of
william
call
her
once
before
you
go
call
once
yet
isabel
sat
up
now
was
the
moment
now
she
must
decide
would
she
go
with
them
or
stay
here
and
write
to
william
which
which
should
it
be
i
must
make
up
my
oh
but
how
could
there
be
any
question
of
course
she
would
stay
here
and
write
titania
piped
moira
no
it
was
too
difficult
i
i
go
with
them
and
write
to
william
later
some
other
time
later
not
now
but
i
shall
certainly
write
thought
isabel
hurriedly
and
laughing
in
the
new
way
she
ran
down
the
stairs
the
voyage
the
picton
boat
was
due
to
leave
at
eleven
it
was
a
beautiful
night
mild
starry
only
when
they
got
out
of
the
cab
and
started
to
walk
down
the
old
wharf
that
jutted
out
into
the
harbour
a
faint
wind
blowing
off
the
water
ruffled
under
fenella
hat
and
she
put
up
her
hand
to
keep
it
on
it
was
dark
on
the
old
wharf
very
dark
the
wool
sheds
the
cattle
trucks
the
cranes
standing
up
so
high
the
little
squat
railway
engine
all
seemed
carved
out
of
solid
darkness
here
and
there
on
a
rounded
that
was
like
the
stalk
of
a
huge
black
mushroom
there
hung
a
lantern
but
it
seemed
afraid
to
unfurl
its
timid
quivering
light
in
all
that
blackness
it
burned
softly
as
if
for
itself
fenella
father
pushed
on
with
quick
nervous
strides
beside
him
her
grandma
bustled
along
in
her
crackling
black
ulster
they
went
so
fast
that
she
had
now
and
again
to
give
an
undignified
little
skip
to
keep
up
with
them
as
well
as
her
luggage
strapped
into
a
neat
sausage
fenella
carried
clasped
to
her
her
grandma
umbrella
and
the
handle
which
was
a
swan
head
kept
giving
her
shoulder
a
sharp
little
peck
as
if
it
too
wanted
her
to
hurry
men
their
caps
pulled
down
their
collars
turned
up
swung
by
a
few
women
all
muffled
scurried
along
and
one
tiny
boy
only
his
little
black
arms
and
legs
showing
out
of
a
white
woolly
shawl
was
jerked
along
angrily
between
his
father
and
mother
he
looked
like
a
baby
fly
that
had
fallen
into
the
cream
then
suddenly
so
suddenly
that
fenella
and
her
grandma
both
leapt
there
sounded
from
behind
the
largest
wool
shed
that
had
a
trail
of
smoke
hanging
over
it
first
whistle
said
her
father
briefly
and
at
that
moment
they
came
in
sight
of
the
picton
boat
lying
beside
the
dark
wharf
all
strung
all
beaded
with
round
golden
lights
the
picton
boat
looked
as
if
she
was
more
ready
to
sail
among
stars
than
out
into
the
cold
sea
people
pressed
along
the
gangway
first
went
her
grandma
then
her
father
then
fenella
there
was
a
high
step
down
on
to
the
deck
and
an
old
sailor
in
a
jersey
standing
by
gave
her
his
dry
hard
hand
they
were
there
they
stepped
out
of
the
way
of
the
hurrying
people
and
standing
under
a
little
iron
stairway
that
led
to
the
upper
deck
they
began
to
say
there
mother
there
your
luggage
said
fenella
father
giving
grandma
another
sausage
thank
you
and
you
got
your
cabin
tickets
safe
yes
and
your
other
tickets
grandma
felt
for
them
inside
her
glove
and
showed
him
the
tips
that
he
sounded
stern
but
fenella
eagerly
watching
him
saw
that
he
looked
tired
and
sad
the
second
whistle
blared
just
above
their
heads
and
a
voice
like
a
cry
shouted
any
more
for
the
gangway
you
give
my
love
to
father
fenella
saw
her
father
lips
say
and
her
grandma
very
agitated
answered
of
course
i
will
dear
go
now
you
be
left
go
now
frank
go
it
all
right
mother
i
got
another
three
to
her
surprise
fenella
saw
her
father
take
off
his
hat
he
clasped
grandma
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
to
him
god
bless
you
mother
she
heard
him
say
and
grandma
put
her
hand
with
the
black
thread
glove
that
was
worn
through
on
her
ring
finger
against
his
cheek
and
she
sobbed
god
bless
you
my
own
brave
son
this
was
so
awful
that
fenella
quickly
turned
her
back
on
them
swallowed
once
twice
and
frowned
terribly
at
a
little
green
star
on
a
mast
head
but
she
had
to
turn
round
again
her
father
was
going
fenella
be
a
good
his
cold
wet
moustache
brushed
her
cheek
but
fenella
caught
hold
of
the
lapels
of
his
coat
how
long
am
i
going
to
stay
she
whispered
anxiously
he
would
look
at
her
he
shook
her
off
gently
and
gently
said
we
see
about
that
here
where
your
hand
he
pressed
something
into
her
palm
here
a
shilling
in
case
you
should
need
a
shilling
she
must
be
going
away
for
ever
father
cried
fenella
but
he
was
gone
he
was
the
last
off
the
ship
the
sailors
put
their
shoulders
to
the
gangway
a
huge
coil
of
dark
rope
went
flying
through
the
air
and
fell
thump
on
the
wharf
a
bell
rang
a
whistle
shrilled
silently
the
dark
wharf
began
to
slip
to
slide
to
edge
away
from
them
now
there
was
a
rush
of
water
between
fenella
strained
to
see
with
all
her
might
was
that
father
turning
round
or
waving
or
standing
alone
or
walking
off
by
himself
the
strip
of
water
grew
broader
darker
now
the
picton
boat
began
to
swing
round
steady
pointing
out
to
sea
it
was
no
good
looking
any
longer
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
few
lights
the
face
of
the
town
clock
hanging
in
the
air
and
more
lights
little
patches
of
them
on
the
dark
hills
the
freshening
wind
tugged
at
fenella
skirts
she
went
back
to
her
grandma
to
her
relief
grandma
seemed
no
longer
sad
she
had
put
the
two
sausages
of
luggage
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
she
was
sitting
on
them
her
hands
folded
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
there
was
an
intent
bright
look
on
her
face
then
fenella
saw
that
her
lips
were
moving
and
guessed
that
she
was
praying
but
the
old
woman
gave
her
a
bright
nod
as
if
to
say
the
prayer
was
nearly
over
she
unclasped
her
hands
sighed
clasped
them
again
bent
forward
and
at
last
gave
herself
a
soft
shake
and
now
child
she
said
fingering
the
bow
of
her
i
think
we
ought
to
see
about
our
cabins
keep
close
to
me
and
mind
you
do
yes
grandma
and
be
careful
the
umbrellas
are
caught
in
the
stair
rail
i
saw
a
beautiful
umbrella
broken
in
half
like
that
on
my
way
yes
dark
figures
of
men
lounged
against
the
rails
in
the
glow
of
their
pipes
a
nose
shone
out
or
the
peak
of
a
cap
or
a
pair
of
eyebrows
fenella
glanced
up
high
in
the
air
a
little
figure
his
hands
thrust
in
his
short
jacket
pockets
stood
staring
out
to
sea
the
ship
rocked
ever
so
little
and
she
thought
the
stars
rocked
too
and
now
a
pale
steward
in
a
linen
coat
holding
a
tray
high
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
stepped
out
of
a
lighted
doorway
and
skimmed
past
them
they
went
through
that
doorway
carefully
over
the
high
step
on
to
the
rubber
mat
and
then
down
such
a
terribly
steep
flight
of
stairs
that
grandma
had
to
put
both
feet
on
each
step
and
fenella
clutched
the
clammy
brass
rail
and
forgot
all
about
the
umbrella
at
the
bottom
grandma
stopped
fenella
was
rather
afraid
she
was
going
to
pray
again
but
no
it
was
only
to
get
out
the
cabin
tickets
they
were
in
the
saloon
it
was
glaring
bright
and
stifling
the
air
smelled
of
paint
and
burnt
and
indiarubber
fenella
wished
her
grandma
would
go
on
but
the
old
woman
was
not
to
be
hurried
an
immense
basket
of
ham
sandwiches
caught
her
eye
she
went
up
to
them
and
touched
the
top
one
delicately
with
her
finger
how
much
are
the
sandwiches
she
asked
tuppence
bawled
a
rude
steward
slamming
down
a
knife
and
fork
grandma
could
hardly
believe
it
twopence
each
she
asked
that
right
said
the
steward
and
he
winked
at
his
companion
grandma
made
a
small
astonished
face
then
she
whispered
primly
to
fenella
what
wickedness
and
they
sailed
out
at
the
further
door
and
along
a
passage
that
had
cabins
on
either
side
such
a
very
nice
stewardess
came
to
meet
them
she
was
dressed
all
in
blue
and
her
collar
and
cuffs
were
fastened
with
large
brass
buttons
she
seemed
to
know
grandma
well
well
crane
said
she
unlocking
their
washstand
we
got
you
back
again
it
not
often
you
give
yourself
a
no
said
grandma
but
this
time
my
dear
son
thoughtfulness
i
hope
began
the
stewardess
then
she
turned
round
and
took
a
long
mournful
look
at
grandma
blackness
and
at
fenella
black
coat
and
skirt
black
blouse
and
hat
with
a
crape
rose
grandma
nodded
it
was
god
will
said
she
the
stewardess
shut
her
lips
and
taking
a
deep
breath
she
seemed
to
expand
what
i
always
say
is
she
said
as
though
it
was
her
own
discovery
sooner
or
later
each
of
us
has
to
go
and
that
a
she
paused
now
can
i
bring
you
anything
mrs
crane
a
cup
of
tea
i
know
it
no
good
offering
you
a
little
something
to
keep
the
cold
grandma
shook
her
head
nothing
thank
you
we
got
a
few
wine
biscuits
and
fenella
has
a
very
nice
then
i
give
you
a
look
later
on
said
the
stewardess
and
she
went
out
shutting
the
door
what
a
very
small
cabin
it
was
it
was
like
being
shut
up
in
a
box
with
grandma
the
dark
round
eye
above
the
washstand
gleamed
at
them
dully
fenella
felt
shy
she
stood
against
the
door
still
clasping
her
luggage
and
the
umbrella
were
they
going
to
get
undressed
in
here
already
her
grandma
had
taken
off
her
bonnet
and
rolling
up
the
strings
she
fixed
each
with
a
pin
to
the
lining
before
she
hung
the
bonnet
up
her
white
hair
shone
like
silk
the
little
bun
at
the
back
was
covered
with
a
black
net
fenella
hardly
ever
saw
her
grandma
with
her
head
uncovered
she
looked
strange
i
shall
put
on
the
woollen
fascinator
your
dear
mother
crocheted
for
me
said
grandma
and
unstrapping
the
sausage
she
took
it
out
and
wound
it
round
her
head
the
fringe
of
grey
bobbles
danced
at
her
eyebrows
as
she
smiled
tenderly
and
mournfully
at
fenella
then
she
undid
her
bodice
and
something
under
that
and
something
else
underneath
that
then
there
seemed
a
short
sharp
tussle
and
grandma
flushed
faintly
snip
snap
she
had
undone
her
stays
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
sitting
on
the
plush
couch
she
slowly
and
carefully
pulled
off
her
boots
and
stood
them
side
by
side
by
the
time
fenella
had
taken
off
her
coat
and
skirt
and
put
on
her
flannel
grandma
was
quite
ready
must
i
take
off
my
boots
grandma
they
grandma
gave
them
a
moment
deep
consideration
you
feel
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
if
you
did
child
said
she
she
kissed
fenella
do
forget
to
say
your
prayers
our
dear
lord
is
with
us
when
we
are
at
sea
even
more
than
when
we
are
on
dry
land
and
because
i
am
an
experienced
traveller
said
grandma
briskly
i
shall
take
the
upper
but
grandma
however
will
you
get
up
there
three
little
steps
were
all
fenella
saw
the
old
woman
gave
a
small
silent
laugh
before
she
mounted
them
nimbly
and
she
peered
over
the
high
bunk
at
the
astonished
fenella
you
did
think
your
grandma
could
do
that
did
you
said
she
and
as
she
sank
back
fenella
heard
her
light
laugh
again
the
hard
square
of
brown
soap
would
not
lather
and
the
water
in
the
bottle
was
like
a
kind
of
blue
jelly
how
hard
it
was
too
to
turn
down
those
stiff
sheets
you
simply
had
to
tear
your
way
in
if
everything
had
been
different
fenella
might
have
got
the
giggles
at
last
she
was
inside
and
while
she
lay
there
panting
there
sounded
from
above
a
long
soft
whispering
as
though
some
one
was
gently
gently
rustling
among
tissue
paper
to
find
something
it
was
grandma
saying
her
prayers
a
long
time
passed
then
the
stewardess
came
in
she
trod
softly
and
leaned
her
hand
on
grandma
bunk
we
just
entering
the
straits
she
said
oh
it
a
fine
night
but
we
rather
empty
we
may
pitch
a
and
indeed
at
that
moment
the
picton
boat
rose
and
rose
and
hung
in
the
air
just
long
enough
to
give
a
shiver
before
she
swung
down
again
and
there
was
the
sound
of
heavy
water
slapping
against
her
sides
fenella
remembered
she
had
left
the
umbrella
standing
up
on
the
little
couch
if
it
fell
over
would
it
break
but
grandma
remembered
too
at
the
same
time
i
wonder
if
you
mind
stewardess
laying
down
my
umbrella
she
whispered
not
at
all
and
the
stewardess
coming
back
to
grandma
breathed
your
little
granddaughter
in
such
a
beautiful
god
be
praised
for
that
said
grandma
poor
little
motherless
mite
said
the
stewardess
and
grandma
was
still
telling
the
stewardess
all
about
what
happened
when
fenella
fell
asleep
but
she
had
been
asleep
long
enough
to
dream
before
she
woke
up
again
to
see
something
waving
in
the
air
above
her
head
what
was
it
what
could
it
be
it
was
a
small
grey
foot
now
another
joined
it
they
seemed
to
be
feeling
about
for
something
there
came
a
sigh
i
awake
grandma
said
fenella
oh
dear
am
i
near
the
ladder
asked
grandma
i
thought
it
was
this
no
grandma
it
the
other
i
put
your
foot
on
it
are
we
there
asked
fenella
in
the
harbour
said
grandma
we
must
get
up
child
you
better
have
a
biscuit
to
steady
yourself
before
you
but
fenella
had
hopped
out
of
her
bunk
the
lamp
was
still
burning
but
night
was
over
and
it
was
cold
peering
through
that
round
eye
she
could
see
far
off
some
rocks
now
they
were
scattered
over
with
foam
now
a
gull
flipped
by
and
now
there
came
a
long
piece
of
real
land
it
land
grandma
said
fenella
wonderingly
as
though
they
had
been
at
sea
for
weeks
together
she
hugged
herself
she
stood
on
one
leg
and
rubbed
it
with
the
toes
of
the
other
foot
she
was
trembling
oh
it
had
all
been
so
sad
lately
was
it
going
to
change
but
all
her
grandma
said
was
make
haste
child
i
should
leave
your
nice
banana
for
the
stewardess
as
you
have
eaten
and
fenella
put
on
her
black
clothes
again
and
a
button
sprang
off
one
of
her
gloves
and
rolled
to
where
she
could
reach
it
they
went
up
on
deck
but
if
it
had
been
cold
in
the
cabin
on
deck
it
was
like
ice
the
sun
was
not
up
yet
but
the
stars
were
dim
and
the
cold
pale
sky
was
the
same
colour
as
the
cold
pale
sea
on
the
land
a
white
mist
rose
and
fell
now
they
could
see
quite
plainly
dark
bush
even
the
shapes
of
the
umbrella
ferns
showed
and
those
strange
silvery
withered
trees
that
are
like
skeletons
now
they
could
see
the
and
some
little
houses
pale
too
clustered
together
like
shells
on
the
lid
of
a
box
the
other
passengers
tramped
up
and
down
but
more
slowly
than
they
had
the
night
before
and
they
looked
gloomy
and
now
the
came
out
to
meet
them
slowly
it
swam
towards
the
picton
boat
and
a
man
holding
a
coil
of
rope
and
a
cart
with
a
small
drooping
horse
and
another
man
sitting
on
the
step
came
too
it
penreddy
fenella
come
for
us
said
grandma
she
sounded
pleased
her
white
waxen
cheeks
were
blue
with
cold
her
chin
trembled
and
she
had
to
keep
wiping
her
eyes
and
her
little
pink
nose
you
got
my
yes
fenella
showed
it
to
her
the
rope
came
flying
through
the
air
and
smack
it
fell
on
to
the
deck
the
gangway
was
lowered
again
fenella
followed
her
grandma
on
to
the
wharf
over
to
the
little
cart
and
a
moment
later
they
were
bowling
away
the
hooves
of
the
little
horse
drummed
over
the
wooden
piles
then
sank
softly
into
the
sandy
road
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
there
was
not
even
a
feather
of
smoke
the
mist
rose
and
fell
and
the
sea
still
sounded
asleep
as
slowly
it
turned
on
the
beach
i
seen
crane
yestiddy
said
penreddy
he
looked
himself
then
missus
knocked
him
up
a
batch
of
scones
last
and
now
the
little
horse
pulled
up
before
one
of
the
houses
they
got
down
fenella
put
her
hand
on
the
gate
and
the
big
trembling
soaked
through
her
up
a
little
path
of
round
white
pebbles
they
went
with
drenched
sleeping
flowers
on
either
side
grandma
delicate
white
picotees
were
so
heavy
with
dew
that
they
were
fallen
but
their
sweet
smell
was
part
of
the
cold
morning
the
blinds
were
down
in
the
little
house
they
mounted
the
steps
on
to
the
veranda
a
pair
of
old
bluchers
was
on
one
side
of
the
door
and
a
large
red
on
the
other
tut
tut
your
grandpa
said
grandma
she
turned
the
handle
not
a
sound
she
called
walter
and
immediately
a
deep
voice
that
sounded
half
stifled
called
back
is
that
you
mary
wait
dear
said
grandma
go
in
she
pushed
fenella
gently
into
a
small
dusky
on
the
table
a
white
cat
that
had
been
folded
up
like
a
camel
rose
stretched
itself
yawned
and
then
sprang
on
to
the
tips
of
its
toes
fenella
buried
one
cold
little
hand
in
the
white
warm
fur
and
smiled
timidly
while
she
stroked
and
listened
to
grandma
gentle
voice
and
the
rolling
tones
of
grandpa
a
door
creaked
come
in
the
old
woman
beckoned
fenella
followed
there
lying
to
one
side
on
an
immense
bed
lay
grandpa
just
his
head
with
a
white
tuft
and
his
rosy
face
and
long
silver
beard
showed
over
the
quilt
he
was
like
a
very
old
bird
well
my
girl
said
grandpa
give
us
a
kiss
fenella
kissed
him
ugh
said
grandpa
her
little
nose
is
as
cold
as
a
button
that
she
holding
her
grandma
umbrella
fenella
smiled
again
and
crooked
the
swan
neck
over
the
above
the
bed
there
was
a
big
text
in
a
deep
black
frame
lost
one
golden
hour
set
with
sixty
diamond
minutes
no
reward
is
offered
for
it
is
gone
for
ever
yer
grandma
painted
that
said
grandpa
and
he
ruffled
his
white
tuft
and
looked
at
fenella
so
merrily
she
almost
thought
he
winked
at
her
miss
brill
although
it
was
so
brilliantly
fine
the
blue
sky
powdered
with
gold
and
great
spots
of
light
like
white
wine
splashed
over
the
jardins
publiques
miss
brill
was
glad
that
she
had
decided
on
her
fur
the
air
was
motionless
but
when
you
opened
your
mouth
there
was
just
a
faint
chill
like
a
chill
from
a
glass
of
iced
water
before
you
sip
and
now
and
again
a
leaf
came
drifting
from
nowhere
from
the
sky
miss
brill
put
up
her
hand
and
touched
her
fur
dear
little
thing
it
was
nice
to
feel
it
again
she
had
taken
it
out
of
its
box
that
afternoon
shaken
out
the
given
it
a
good
brush
and
rubbed
the
life
back
into
the
dim
little
eyes
what
has
been
happening
to
me
said
the
sad
little
eyes
oh
how
sweet
it
was
to
see
them
snap
at
her
again
from
the
red
eiderdown
but
the
nose
which
was
of
some
black
composition
was
at
all
firm
it
must
have
had
a
knock
somehow
never
mind
a
little
dab
of
black
when
the
time
came
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
little
rogue
yes
she
really
felt
like
that
about
it
little
rogue
biting
its
tail
just
by
her
left
ear
she
could
have
taken
it
off
and
laid
it
on
her
lap
and
stroked
it
she
felt
a
tingling
in
her
hands
and
arms
but
that
came
from
walking
she
supposed
and
when
she
breathed
something
light
and
sad
no
not
sad
exactly
something
gentle
seemed
to
move
in
her
bosom
there
were
a
number
of
people
out
this
afternoon
far
more
than
last
sunday
and
the
band
sounded
louder
and
gayer
that
was
because
the
season
had
begun
for
although
the
band
played
all
the
year
round
on
sundays
out
of
season
it
was
never
the
same
it
was
like
some
one
playing
with
only
the
family
to
listen
it
did
care
how
it
played
if
there
were
any
strangers
present
was
the
conductor
wearing
a
new
coat
too
she
was
sure
it
was
new
he
scraped
with
his
foot
and
flapped
his
arms
like
a
rooster
about
to
crow
and
the
bandsmen
sitting
in
the
green
rotunda
blew
out
their
cheeks
and
glared
at
the
music
now
there
came
a
little
flutey
bit
very
pretty
a
little
chain
of
bright
drops
she
was
sure
it
would
be
repeated
it
was
she
lifted
her
head
and
smiled
only
two
people
shared
her
special
seat
a
fine
old
man
in
a
velvet
coat
his
hands
clasped
over
a
huge
carved
and
a
big
old
woman
sitting
upright
with
a
roll
of
knitting
on
her
embroidered
apron
they
did
not
speak
this
was
disappointing
for
miss
brill
always
looked
forward
to
the
conversation
she
had
become
really
quite
expert
she
thought
at
listening
as
though
she
did
listen
at
sitting
in
other
people
lives
just
for
a
minute
while
they
talked
round
her
she
glanced
sideways
at
the
old
couple
perhaps
they
would
go
soon
last
sunday
too
had
been
as
interesting
as
usual
an
englishman
and
his
wife
he
wearing
a
dreadful
panama
hat
and
she
button
boots
and
she
gone
on
the
whole
time
about
how
she
ought
to
wear
spectacles
she
knew
she
needed
them
but
that
it
was
no
good
getting
any
they
be
sure
to
break
and
they
never
keep
on
and
he
been
so
patient
suggested
everything
gold
rims
the
kind
that
curved
round
your
ears
little
pads
inside
the
bridge
no
nothing
would
please
her
always
be
sliding
down
my
nose
miss
brill
had
wanted
to
shake
her
the
old
people
sat
on
the
bench
still
as
statues
never
mind
there
was
always
the
crowd
to
watch
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
and
the
band
rotunda
the
couples
and
groups
paraded
stopped
to
talk
to
greet
to
buy
a
handful
of
flowers
from
the
old
beggar
who
had
his
tray
fixed
to
the
railings
little
children
ran
among
them
swooping
and
laughing
little
boys
with
big
white
silk
bows
under
their
chins
little
girls
little
french
dolls
dressed
up
in
velvet
and
lace
and
sometimes
a
tiny
staggerer
came
suddenly
rocking
into
the
open
from
under
the
trees
stopped
stared
as
suddenly
sat
down
flop
until
its
small
mother
like
a
young
hen
rushed
scolding
to
its
rescue
other
people
sat
on
the
benches
and
green
chairs
but
they
were
nearly
always
the
same
sunday
after
sunday
and
miss
brill
had
often
noticed
there
was
something
funny
about
nearly
all
of
them
they
were
odd
silent
nearly
all
old
and
from
the
way
they
stared
they
looked
as
though
they
just
come
from
dark
little
rooms
or
even
even
cupboards
behind
the
rotunda
the
slender
trees
with
yellow
leaves
down
drooping
and
through
them
just
a
line
of
sea
and
beyond
the
blue
sky
with
clouds
tum
tum
ta
blew
the
band
two
young
girls
in
red
came
by
and
two
young
soldiers
in
blue
met
them
and
they
laughed
and
paired
and
went
off
two
peasant
women
with
funny
straw
hats
passed
gravely
leading
beautiful
donkeys
a
cold
pale
nun
hurried
by
a
beautiful
woman
came
along
and
dropped
her
bunch
of
violets
and
a
little
boy
ran
after
to
hand
them
to
her
and
she
took
them
and
threw
them
away
as
if
they
been
poisoned
dear
me
miss
brill
did
know
whether
to
admire
that
or
not
and
now
an
ermine
toque
and
a
gentleman
in
grey
met
just
in
front
of
her
he
was
tall
stiff
dignified
and
she
was
wearing
the
ermine
toque
bought
when
her
hair
was
yellow
now
everything
her
hair
her
face
even
her
eyes
was
the
same
colour
as
the
shabby
ermine
and
her
hand
in
its
cleaned
glove
lifted
to
dab
her
lips
was
a
tiny
yellowish
paw
oh
she
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
delighted
she
rather
thought
they
were
going
to
meet
that
afternoon
she
described
where
been
everywhere
here
there
along
by
the
sea
the
day
was
so
charming
did
he
agree
and
would
he
perhaps
but
he
shook
his
head
lighted
a
cigarette
slowly
breathed
a
great
deep
puff
into
her
face
and
even
while
she
was
still
talking
and
laughing
flicked
the
match
away
and
walked
on
the
ermine
toque
was
alone
she
smiled
more
brightly
than
ever
but
even
the
band
seemed
to
know
what
she
was
feeling
and
played
more
softly
played
tenderly
and
the
drum
beat
the
brute
the
brute
over
and
over
what
would
she
do
what
was
going
to
happen
now
but
as
miss
brill
wondered
the
ermine
toque
turned
raised
her
hand
as
though
she
seen
some
one
else
much
nicer
just
over
there
and
pattered
away
and
the
band
changed
again
and
played
more
quickly
more
gayly
than
ever
and
the
old
couple
on
miss
brill
seat
got
up
and
marched
away
and
such
a
funny
old
man
with
long
whiskers
hobbled
along
in
time
to
the
music
and
was
nearly
knocked
over
by
four
girls
walking
abreast
oh
how
fascinating
it
was
how
she
enjoyed
it
how
she
loved
sitting
here
watching
it
all
it
was
like
a
play
it
was
exactly
like
a
play
who
could
believe
the
sky
at
the
back
was
painted
but
it
was
till
a
little
brown
dog
trotted
on
solemn
and
then
slowly
trotted
off
like
a
little
theatre
dog
a
little
dog
that
had
been
drugged
that
miss
brill
discovered
what
it
was
that
made
it
so
exciting
they
were
all
on
the
stage
they
were
only
the
audience
not
only
looking
on
they
were
acting
even
she
had
a
part
and
came
every
sunday
no
doubt
somebody
would
have
noticed
if
she
had
been
there
she
was
part
of
the
performance
after
all
how
strange
she
never
thought
of
it
like
that
before
and
yet
it
explained
why
she
made
such
a
point
of
starting
from
home
at
just
the
same
time
each
week
so
as
not
to
be
late
for
the
performance
and
it
also
explained
why
she
had
quite
a
queer
shy
feeling
at
telling
her
english
pupils
how
she
spent
her
sunday
afternoons
no
wonder
miss
brill
nearly
laughed
out
loud
she
was
on
the
stage
she
thought
of
the
old
invalid
gentleman
to
whom
she
read
the
newspaper
four
afternoons
a
week
while
he
slept
in
the
garden
she
had
got
quite
used
to
the
frail
head
on
the
cotton
pillow
the
hollowed
eyes
the
open
mouth
and
the
high
pinched
nose
if
he
been
dead
she
might
have
noticed
for
weeks
she
would
have
minded
but
suddenly
he
knew
he
was
having
the
paper
read
to
him
by
an
actress
an
actress
the
old
head
lifted
two
points
of
light
quivered
in
the
old
eyes
an
actress
are
ye
and
miss
brill
smoothed
the
newspaper
as
though
it
were
the
manuscript
of
her
part
and
said
gently
yes
i
have
been
an
actress
for
a
long
the
band
had
been
having
a
rest
now
they
started
again
and
what
they
played
was
warm
sunny
yet
there
was
just
a
faint
chill
a
something
what
was
it
not
sadness
no
not
sadness
a
something
that
made
you
want
to
sing
the
tune
lifted
lifted
the
light
shone
and
it
seemed
to
miss
brill
that
in
another
moment
all
of
them
all
the
whole
company
would
begin
singing
the
young
ones
the
laughing
ones
who
were
moving
together
they
would
begin
and
the
men
voices
very
resolute
and
brave
would
join
them
and
then
she
too
she
too
and
the
others
on
the
benches
they
would
come
in
with
a
kind
of
accompaniment
something
low
that
scarcely
rose
or
fell
something
so
beautiful
moving
and
miss
brill
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
looked
smiling
at
all
the
other
members
of
the
company
yes
we
understand
we
understand
she
thought
though
what
they
understood
she
did
know
just
at
that
moment
a
boy
and
girl
came
and
sat
down
where
the
old
couple
had
been
they
were
beautifully
dressed
they
were
in
love
the
hero
and
heroine
of
course
just
arrived
from
his
father
yacht
and
still
soundlessly
singing
still
with
that
trembling
smile
miss
brill
prepared
to
listen
no
not
now
said
the
girl
not
here
i
but
why
because
of
that
stupid
old
thing
at
the
end
there
asked
the
boy
why
does
she
come
here
at
all
who
wants
her
why
does
she
keep
her
silly
old
mug
at
home
it
her
which
is
so
funny
giggled
the
girl
it
exactly
like
a
fried
ah
be
off
with
you
said
the
boy
in
an
angry
whisper
then
tell
me
ma
petite
chere
no
not
here
said
the
girl
not
on
her
way
home
she
usually
bought
a
slice
of
at
the
baker
it
was
her
sunday
treat
sometimes
there
was
an
almond
in
her
slice
sometimes
not
it
made
a
great
difference
if
there
was
an
almond
it
was
like
carrying
home
a
tiny
present
a
surprise
something
that
might
very
well
not
have
been
there
she
hurried
on
the
almond
sundays
and
struck
the
match
for
the
kettle
in
quite
a
dashing
way
but
she
passed
the
baker
by
climbed
the
stairs
went
into
the
little
dark
room
her
room
like
a
cupboard
and
sat
down
on
the
red
eiderdown
she
sat
there
for
a
long
time
the
box
that
the
fur
came
out
of
was
on
the
bed
she
unclasped
the
necklet
quickly
quickly
without
looking
laid
it
inside
but
when
she
put
the
lid
on
she
thought
she
heard
something
crying
her
first
ball
exactly
when
the
ball
began
leila
would
have
found
it
hard
to
say
perhaps
her
first
real
partner
was
the
cab
it
did
not
matter
that
she
shared
the
cab
with
the
sheridan
girls
and
their
brother
she
sat
back
in
her
own
little
corner
of
it
and
the
bolster
on
which
her
hand
rested
felt
like
the
sleeve
of
an
unknown
young
man
dress
suit
and
away
they
bowled
past
waltzing
and
houses
and
fences
and
trees
have
you
really
never
been
to
a
ball
before
leila
but
my
child
how
too
weird
cried
the
sheridan
girls
our
nearest
neighbour
was
fifteen
miles
said
leila
softly
gently
opening
and
shutting
her
fan
oh
dear
how
hard
it
was
to
be
indifferent
like
the
others
she
tried
not
to
smile
too
much
she
tried
not
to
care
but
every
single
thing
was
so
new
and
exciting
meg
tuberoses
jose
long
loop
of
amber
laura
little
dark
head
pushing
above
her
white
fur
like
a
flower
through
snow
she
would
remember
for
ever
it
even
gave
her
a
pang
to
see
her
cousin
laurie
throw
away
the
wisps
of
tissue
paper
he
pulled
from
the
fastenings
of
his
new
gloves
she
would
like
to
have
kept
those
wisps
as
a
keepsake
as
a
remembrance
laurie
leaned
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
laura
knee
look
here
darling
he
said
the
third
and
the
ninth
as
usual
twig
oh
how
marvellous
to
have
a
brother
in
her
excitement
leila
felt
that
if
there
had
been
time
if
it
had
been
impossible
she
could
have
helped
crying
because
she
was
an
only
child
and
no
brother
had
ever
said
twig
to
her
no
sister
would
ever
say
as
meg
said
to
jose
that
moment
i
never
known
your
hair
go
up
more
successfully
than
it
has
but
of
course
there
was
no
time
they
were
at
the
drill
hall
already
there
were
cabs
in
front
of
them
and
cabs
behind
the
road
was
bright
on
either
side
with
moving
lights
and
on
the
pavement
gay
couples
seemed
to
float
through
the
air
little
satin
shoes
chased
each
other
like
birds
hold
on
to
me
leila
you
get
lost
said
laura
come
on
girls
let
make
a
dash
for
it
said
laurie
leila
put
two
fingers
on
laura
pink
velvet
cloak
and
they
were
somehow
lifted
past
the
big
golden
lantern
carried
along
the
passage
and
pushed
into
the
little
room
marked
here
the
crowd
was
so
great
there
was
hardly
space
to
take
off
their
things
the
noise
was
deafening
two
benches
on
either
side
were
stacked
high
with
wraps
two
old
women
in
white
aprons
ran
up
and
down
tossing
fresh
armfuls
and
everybody
was
pressing
forward
trying
to
get
at
the
little
and
mirror
at
the
far
end
a
great
quivering
jet
of
gas
lighted
the
ladies
room
it
could
wait
it
was
dancing
already
when
the
door
opened
again
and
there
came
a
burst
of
tuning
from
the
drill
hall
it
leaped
almost
to
the
ceiling
dark
girls
fair
girls
were
patting
their
hair
tying
ribbons
again
tucking
handkerchiefs
down
the
fronts
of
their
bodices
smoothing
gloves
and
because
they
were
all
laughing
it
seemed
to
leila
that
they
were
all
lovely
are
there
any
invisible
cried
a
voice
how
most
extraordinary
i
ca
see
a
single
invisible
powder
my
back
there
a
darling
cried
some
one
else
but
i
must
have
a
needle
and
cotton
i
torn
simply
miles
and
miles
of
the
frill
wailed
a
third
then
pass
them
along
pass
them
along
the
straw
basket
of
programmes
was
tossed
from
arm
to
arm
darling
little
programmes
with
pink
pencils
and
fluffy
tassels
leila
fingers
shook
as
she
took
one
out
of
the
basket
she
wanted
to
ask
some
one
am
i
meant
to
have
one
too
but
she
had
just
time
to
read
waltz
two
in
a
canoe
polka
the
feathers
fly
when
meg
cried
ready
leila
and
they
pressed
their
way
through
the
crush
in
the
passage
towards
the
big
double
doors
of
the
drill
hall
dancing
had
not
begun
yet
but
the
band
had
stopped
tuning
and
the
noise
was
so
great
it
seemed
that
when
it
did
begin
to
play
it
would
never
be
heard
leila
pressing
close
to
meg
looking
over
shoulder
felt
that
even
the
little
quivering
coloured
flags
strung
across
the
ceiling
were
talking
she
quite
forgot
to
be
shy
she
forgot
how
in
the
middle
of
dressing
she
had
sat
down
on
the
bed
with
one
shoe
off
and
one
shoe
on
and
begged
her
mother
to
ring
up
her
cousins
and
say
she
could
go
after
all
and
the
rush
of
longing
she
had
had
to
be
sitting
on
the
veranda
of
their
forsaken
home
listening
to
the
baby
owls
crying
more
pork
in
the
moonlight
was
changed
to
a
rush
of
joy
so
sweet
that
it
was
hard
to
bear
alone
she
clutched
her
fan
and
gazing
at
the
gleaming
golden
floor
the
azaleas
the
lanterns
the
stage
at
one
end
with
its
red
carpet
and
gilt
chairs
and
the
band
in
a
corner
she
thought
breathlessly
how
heavenly
how
simply
heavenly
all
the
girls
stood
grouped
together
at
one
side
of
the
doors
the
men
at
the
other
and
the
chaperones
in
dark
dresses
smiling
rather
foolishly
walked
with
little
careful
steps
over
the
polished
floor
towards
the
stage
this
is
my
little
country
cousin
leila
be
nice
to
her
find
her
partners
she
under
my
wing
said
meg
going
up
to
one
girl
after
another
strange
faces
smiled
at
leila
sweetly
vaguely
strange
voices
answered
of
course
my
but
leila
felt
the
girls
did
really
see
her
they
were
looking
towards
the
men
why
did
the
men
begin
what
were
they
waiting
for
there
they
stood
smoothing
their
gloves
patting
their
glossy
hair
and
smiling
among
themselves
then
quite
suddenly
as
if
they
had
only
just
made
up
their
minds
that
that
was
what
they
had
to
do
the
men
came
gliding
over
the
parquet
there
was
a
joyful
flutter
among
the
girls
a
tall
fair
man
flew
up
to
meg
seized
her
programme
scribbled
something
meg
passed
him
on
to
leila
may
i
have
the
pleasure
he
ducked
and
smiled
there
came
a
dark
man
wearing
an
eyeglass
then
cousin
laurie
with
a
friend
and
laura
with
a
little
freckled
fellow
whose
tie
was
crooked
then
quite
an
old
man
fat
with
a
big
bald
patch
on
his
head
took
her
programme
and
murmured
let
me
see
let
me
see
and
he
was
a
long
time
comparing
his
programme
which
looked
black
with
names
with
hers
it
seemed
to
give
him
so
much
trouble
that
leila
was
ashamed
oh
please
do
bother
she
said
eagerly
but
instead
of
replying
the
fat
man
wrote
something
glanced
at
her
again
do
i
remember
this
bright
little
face
he
said
softly
is
it
known
to
me
of
yore
at
that
moment
the
band
began
playing
the
fat
man
disappeared
he
was
tossed
away
on
a
great
wave
of
music
that
came
flying
over
the
gleaming
floor
breaking
the
groups
up
into
couples
scattering
them
sending
them
spinning
leila
had
learned
to
dance
at
boarding
school
every
saturday
afternoon
the
boarders
were
hurried
off
to
a
little
corrugated
iron
mission
hall
where
miss
eccles
of
london
held
her
select
classes
but
the
difference
between
that
hall
with
calico
texts
on
the
walls
the
poor
terrified
little
woman
in
a
brown
velvet
toque
with
rabbit
ears
thumping
the
cold
piano
miss
eccles
poking
the
feet
with
her
long
white
wand
and
this
was
so
tremendous
that
leila
was
sure
if
her
partner
did
come
and
she
had
to
listen
to
that
marvellous
music
and
to
watch
the
others
sliding
gliding
over
the
golden
floor
she
would
die
at
least
or
faint
or
lift
her
arms
and
fly
out
of
one
of
those
dark
windows
that
showed
the
stars
ours
i
think
some
one
bowed
smiled
and
offered
her
his
arm
she
had
to
die
after
all
some
one
hand
pressed
her
waist
and
she
floated
away
like
a
flower
that
is
tossed
into
a
pool
quite
a
good
floor
is
it
drawled
a
faint
voice
close
to
her
ear
i
think
it
most
beautifully
slippery
said
leila
pardon
the
faint
voice
sounded
surprised
leila
said
it
again
and
there
was
a
tiny
pause
before
the
voice
echoed
oh
quite
and
she
was
swung
round
again
he
steered
so
beautifully
that
was
the
great
difference
between
dancing
with
girls
and
men
leila
decided
girls
banged
into
each
other
and
stamped
on
each
other
feet
the
girl
who
was
gentleman
always
clutched
you
so
the
azaleas
were
separate
flowers
no
longer
they
were
pink
and
white
flags
streaming
by
were
you
at
the
bells
last
week
the
voice
came
again
it
sounded
tired
leila
wondered
whether
she
ought
to
ask
him
if
he
would
like
to
stop
no
this
is
my
first
dance
said
she
her
partner
gave
a
little
gasping
laugh
oh
i
say
he
protested
yes
it
is
really
the
first
dance
i
ever
been
leila
was
most
fervent
it
was
such
a
relief
to
be
able
to
tell
somebody
you
see
i
lived
in
the
country
all
my
life
up
till
now
at
that
moment
the
music
stopped
and
they
went
to
sit
on
two
chairs
against
the
wall
leila
tucked
her
pink
satin
feet
under
and
fanned
herself
while
she
blissfully
watched
the
other
couples
passing
and
disappearing
through
the
swing
doors
enjoying
yourself
leila
asked
jose
nodding
her
golden
head
laura
passed
and
gave
her
the
faintest
little
wink
it
made
leila
wonder
for
a
moment
whether
she
was
quite
grown
up
after
all
certainly
her
partner
did
not
say
very
much
he
coughed
tucked
his
handkerchief
away
pulled
down
his
waistcoat
took
a
minute
thread
off
his
sleeve
but
it
did
matter
almost
immediately
the
band
started
and
her
second
partner
seemed
to
spring
from
the
ceiling
floor
not
bad
said
the
new
voice
did
one
always
begin
with
the
floor
and
then
were
you
at
the
neaves
on
tuesday
and
again
leila
explained
perhaps
it
was
a
little
strange
that
her
partners
were
not
more
interested
for
it
was
thrilling
her
first
ball
she
was
only
at
the
beginning
of
everything
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
known
what
the
night
was
like
before
up
till
now
it
had
been
dark
silent
beautiful
very
often
oh
yes
but
mournful
somehow
solemn
and
now
it
would
never
be
like
that
again
it
had
opened
dazzling
bright
care
for
an
ice
said
her
partner
and
they
went
through
the
swing
doors
down
the
passage
to
the
supper
room
her
cheeks
burned
she
was
fearfully
thirsty
how
sweet
the
ices
looked
on
little
glass
plates
and
how
cold
the
frosted
spoon
was
iced
too
and
when
they
came
back
to
the
hall
there
was
the
fat
man
waiting
for
her
by
the
door
it
gave
her
quite
a
shock
again
to
see
how
old
he
was
he
ought
to
have
been
on
the
stage
with
the
fathers
and
mothers
and
when
leila
compared
him
with
her
other
partners
he
looked
shabby
his
waistcoat
was
creased
there
was
a
button
off
his
glove
his
coat
looked
as
if
it
was
dusty
with
french
chalk
come
along
little
lady
said
the
fat
man
he
scarcely
troubled
to
clasp
her
and
they
moved
away
so
gently
it
was
more
like
walking
than
dancing
but
he
said
not
a
word
about
the
floor
your
first
dance
is
it
he
murmured
how
did
you
know
ah
said
the
fat
man
that
what
it
is
to
be
old
he
wheezed
faintly
as
he
steered
her
past
an
awkward
couple
you
see
i
been
doing
this
kind
of
thing
for
the
last
thirty
thirty
years
cried
leila
twelve
years
before
she
was
born
it
hardly
bears
thinking
about
does
it
said
the
fat
man
gloomily
leila
looked
at
his
bald
head
and
she
felt
quite
sorry
for
him
i
think
it
marvellous
to
be
still
going
on
she
said
kindly
kind
little
lady
said
the
fat
man
and
he
pressed
her
a
little
closer
and
hummed
a
bar
of
the
waltz
of
course
he
said
you
hope
to
last
anything
like
as
long
as
that
said
the
fat
man
long
before
that
you
be
sitting
up
there
on
the
stage
looking
on
in
your
nice
black
velvet
and
these
pretty
arms
will
have
turned
into
little
short
fat
ones
and
you
beat
time
with
such
a
different
kind
of
fan
a
black
bony
the
fat
man
seemed
to
shudder
and
smile
away
like
the
poor
old
dears
up
there
and
point
to
your
daughter
and
tell
the
elderly
lady
next
to
you
how
some
dreadful
man
tried
to
kiss
her
at
the
club
ball
and
your
heart
will
ache
ache
the
fat
man
squeezed
her
closer
still
as
if
he
really
was
sorry
for
that
poor
heart
because
no
one
wants
to
kiss
you
now
and
you
say
how
unpleasant
these
polished
floors
are
to
walk
on
how
dangerous
they
are
eh
mademoiselle
twinkletoes
said
the
fat
man
softly
leila
gave
a
light
little
laugh
but
she
did
not
feel
like
laughing
was
it
could
it
all
be
true
it
sounded
terribly
true
was
this
first
ball
only
the
beginning
of
her
last
ball
after
all
at
that
the
music
seemed
to
change
it
sounded
sad
sad
it
rose
upon
a
great
sigh
oh
how
quickly
things
changed
why
did
happiness
last
for
ever
for
ever
was
a
bit
too
long
i
want
to
stop
she
said
in
a
breathless
voice
the
fat
man
led
her
to
the
door
no
she
said
i
wo
go
outside
i
wo
sit
down
i
just
stand
here
thank
she
leaned
against
the
wall
tapping
with
her
foot
pulling
up
her
gloves
and
trying
to
smile
but
deep
inside
her
a
little
girl
threw
her
pinafore
over
her
head
and
sobbed
why
had
he
spoiled
it
all
i
say
you
know
said
the
fat
man
you
must
take
me
seriously
little
as
if
i
should
said
leila
tossing
her
small
dark
head
and
sucking
her
underlip
again
the
couples
paraded
the
swing
doors
opened
and
shut
now
new
music
was
given
out
by
the
bandmaster
but
leila
did
want
to
dance
any
more
she
wanted
to
be
home
or
sitting
on
the
veranda
listening
to
those
baby
owls
when
she
looked
through
the
dark
windows
at
the
stars
they
had
long
beams
like
wings
but
presently
a
soft
melting
ravishing
tune
began
and
a
young
man
with
curly
hair
bowed
before
her
she
would
have
to
dance
out
of
politeness
until
she
could
find
meg
very
stiffly
she
walked
into
the
middle
very
haughtily
she
put
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
but
in
one
minute
in
one
turn
her
feet
glided
glided
the
lights
the
azaleas
the
dresses
the
pink
faces
the
velvet
chairs
all
became
one
beautiful
flying
wheel
and
when
her
next
partner
bumped
her
into
the
fat
man
and
he
said
pardon
she
smiled
at
him
more
radiantly
than
ever
she
did
even
recognise
him
again
the
singing
lesson
with
despair
cold
sharp
despair
buried
deep
in
her
heart
like
a
wicked
knife
miss
meadows
in
cap
and
gown
and
carrying
a
little
baton
trod
the
cold
corridors
that
led
to
the
music
hall
girls
of
all
ages
rosy
from
the
air
and
bubbling
over
with
that
gleeful
excitement
that
comes
from
running
to
school
on
a
fine
autumn
morning
hurried
skipped
fluttered
by
from
the
hollow
came
a
quick
drumming
of
voices
a
bell
rang
a
voice
like
a
bird
cried
and
then
there
came
from
the
staircase
a
tremendous
some
one
had
dropped
her
dumbbells
the
science
mistress
stopped
miss
meadows
good
she
cried
in
her
sweet
affected
drawl
is
it
cold
it
might
be
miss
meadows
hugging
the
knife
stared
in
hatred
at
the
science
mistress
everything
about
her
was
sweet
pale
like
honey
you
wold
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
a
bee
caught
in
the
tangles
of
that
yellow
hair
it
is
rather
sharp
said
miss
meadows
grimly
the
other
smiled
her
sugary
smile
you
look
said
she
her
blue
eyes
opened
wide
there
came
a
mocking
light
in
them
had
she
noticed
anything
oh
not
quite
as
bad
as
that
said
miss
meadows
and
she
gave
the
science
mistress
in
exchange
for
her
smile
a
quick
grimace
and
passed
on
forms
four
five
and
six
were
assembled
in
the
music
hall
the
noise
was
deafening
on
the
platform
by
the
piano
stood
mary
beazley
miss
meadows
favourite
who
played
accompaniments
she
was
turning
the
music
stool
when
she
saw
miss
meadows
she
gave
a
loud
warning
girls
and
miss
meadows
her
hands
thrust
in
her
sleeves
the
baton
under
her
arm
strode
down
the
centre
aisle
mounted
the
steps
turned
sharply
seized
the
brass
music
stand
planted
it
in
front
of
her
and
gave
two
sharp
taps
with
her
baton
for
silence
silence
please
immediately
and
looking
at
nobody
her
glance
swept
over
that
sea
of
coloured
flannel
blouses
with
bobbing
pink
faces
and
hands
quivering
butterfly
and
outspread
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
they
were
thinking
meady
is
in
a
well
let
them
think
it
her
eyelids
quivered
she
tossed
her
head
defying
them
what
could
the
thoughts
of
those
creatures
matter
to
some
one
who
stood
there
bleeding
to
death
pierced
to
the
heart
to
the
heart
by
such
a
letter
i
feel
more
and
more
strongly
that
our
marriage
would
be
a
mistake
not
that
i
do
not
love
you
i
love
you
as
much
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
love
any
woman
but
truth
to
tell
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
and
the
idea
of
settling
down
fills
me
with
nothing
but
and
the
word
disgust
was
scratched
out
lightly
and
regret
written
over
the
top
basil
miss
meadows
stalked
over
to
the
piano
and
mary
beazley
who
was
waiting
for
this
moment
bent
forward
her
curls
fell
over
her
cheeks
while
she
breathed
good
morning
miss
meadows
and
she
motioned
towards
rather
than
handed
to
her
mistress
a
beautiful
yellow
chrysanthemum
this
little
ritual
of
the
flower
had
been
gone
through
for
ages
and
ages
quite
a
term
and
a
half
it
was
as
much
part
of
the
lesson
as
opening
the
piano
but
this
morning
instead
of
taking
it
up
instead
of
tucking
it
into
her
belt
while
she
leant
over
mary
and
said
thank
you
mary
how
very
nice
turn
to
page
what
was
mary
horror
when
miss
meadows
totally
ignored
the
chrysanthemum
made
no
reply
to
her
greeting
but
said
in
a
voice
of
ice
page
fourteen
please
and
mark
the
accents
staggering
moment
mary
blushed
until
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
but
miss
meadows
was
gone
back
to
the
music
stand
her
voice
rang
through
the
music
hall
page
fourteen
we
will
begin
with
page
fourteen
lament
now
girls
you
ought
to
know
it
by
this
time
we
shall
take
it
all
together
not
in
parts
all
together
and
without
expression
sing
it
though
quite
simply
beating
time
with
the
left
she
raised
the
baton
she
tapped
the
music
stand
twice
down
came
mary
on
the
opening
chord
down
came
all
those
left
hands
beating
the
air
and
in
chimed
those
young
mournful
voices
fast
ah
too
fast
fade
the
of
pleasure
soon
autumn
yields
unto
drear
fleetly
ah
fleetly
gay
measure
passes
away
from
the
listening
good
heavens
what
could
be
more
tragic
than
that
lament
every
note
was
a
sigh
a
sob
a
groan
of
awful
mournfulness
miss
meadows
lifted
her
arms
in
the
wide
gown
and
began
conducting
with
both
hands
i
feel
more
and
more
strongly
that
our
marriage
would
be
a
mistake
she
beat
and
the
voices
cried
fleetly
ah
what
could
have
possessed
him
to
write
such
a
letter
what
could
have
led
up
to
it
it
came
out
of
nothing
his
last
letter
had
been
all
about
a
bookcase
he
had
bought
for
our
books
and
a
natty
little
he
had
seen
a
very
neat
affair
with
a
carved
owl
on
a
bracket
holding
three
in
its
how
she
had
smiled
at
that
so
like
a
man
to
think
one
needed
three
from
the
listening
ear
sang
the
voices
once
again
said
miss
meadows
but
this
time
in
parts
still
without
fast
ah
too
with
the
gloom
of
the
contraltos
added
one
could
scarcely
help
shuddering
fade
the
roses
of
last
time
he
had
come
to
see
her
basil
had
worn
a
rose
in
his
buttonhole
how
handsome
he
had
looked
in
that
bright
blue
suit
with
that
dark
red
rose
and
he
knew
it
too
he
could
help
knowing
it
first
he
stroked
his
hair
then
his
moustache
his
teeth
gleamed
when
he
smiled
the
headmaster
wife
keeps
on
asking
me
to
dinner
it
a
perfect
nuisance
i
never
get
an
evening
to
myself
in
that
but
ca
you
refuse
oh
well
it
does
do
for
a
man
in
my
position
to
be
music
gay
measure
wailed
the
voices
the
willow
trees
outside
the
high
narrow
windows
waved
in
the
wind
they
had
lost
half
their
leaves
the
tiny
ones
that
clung
wriggled
like
fishes
caught
on
a
line
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
the
voices
were
silent
the
piano
waited
quite
good
said
miss
meadows
but
still
in
such
a
strange
stony
tone
that
the
younger
girls
began
to
feel
positively
frightened
but
now
that
we
know
it
we
shall
take
it
with
expression
as
much
expression
as
you
can
put
into
it
think
of
the
words
girls
use
your
imaginations
ah
too
fast
cried
miss
meadows
that
ought
to
break
out
a
loud
strong
forte
a
lament
and
then
in
the
second
line
drear
make
that
sound
as
if
a
cold
wind
were
blowing
through
it
said
she
so
awfully
that
mary
beazley
on
the
music
stool
wriggled
her
spine
the
third
line
should
be
one
crescendo
ah
fleetly
music
gay
measure
breaking
on
the
first
word
of
the
last
line
passes
and
then
on
the
word
you
must
begin
to
die
to
fade
until
listening
ear
is
nothing
more
than
a
faint
whisper
you
can
slow
down
as
much
as
you
like
almost
on
the
last
line
now
again
the
two
light
taps
she
lifted
her
arms
again
ah
too
fast
and
the
idea
of
settling
down
fills
me
with
nothing
but
disgust
disgust
was
what
he
had
written
that
was
as
good
as
to
say
their
engagement
was
definitely
broken
off
broken
off
their
engagement
people
had
been
surprised
enough
that
she
had
got
engaged
the
science
mistress
would
not
believe
it
at
first
but
nobody
had
been
as
surprised
as
she
she
was
thirty
basil
was
it
had
been
a
miracle
simply
a
miracle
to
hear
him
say
as
they
walked
home
from
church
that
very
dark
night
you
know
somehow
or
other
i
got
fond
of
and
he
had
taken
hold
of
the
end
of
her
ostrich
feather
boa
passes
away
from
the
listening
repeat
repeat
said
miss
meadows
more
expression
girls
once
more
fast
ah
too
the
older
girls
were
crimson
some
of
the
younger
ones
began
to
cry
big
spots
of
rain
blew
against
the
windows
and
one
could
hear
the
willows
whispering
not
that
i
do
not
love
you
but
my
darling
if
you
love
me
thought
miss
meadows
i
do
mind
how
much
it
is
love
me
as
little
as
you
but
she
knew
he
love
her
not
to
have
cared
enough
to
scratch
out
that
word
disgust
so
that
she
could
read
it
soon
autumn
yields
unto
winter
she
would
have
to
leave
the
school
too
she
could
never
face
the
science
mistress
or
the
girls
after
it
got
known
she
would
have
to
disappear
somewhere
passes
the
voices
began
to
die
to
fade
to
whisper
to
vanish
suddenly
the
door
opened
a
little
girl
in
blue
walked
fussily
up
the
aisle
hanging
her
head
biting
her
lips
and
twisting
the
silver
bangle
on
her
red
little
wrist
she
came
up
the
steps
and
stood
before
miss
meadows
well
monica
what
is
it
oh
if

please
miss

said
the
little
girl
gasping
miss
wyatt
wants
to
see

in
the
mistress
very
well
said
miss
meadows
and
she
called
to
the
girls
i
shall
put
you
on
your
honour
to
talk
quietly
while
i
am
but
they
were
too
subdued
to
do
anything
else
most
of
them
were
blowing
their
noses
the
corridors
were
silent
and
cold
they
echoed
to
miss
meadows
steps
the
head
mistress
sat
at
her
desk
for
a
moment
she
did
not
look
up
she
was
as
usual
disentangling
her
eyeglasses
which
had
got
caught
in
her
lace
tie
sit
down
miss
meadows
she
said
very
kindly
and
then
she
picked
up
a
pink
envelope
from
the
i
sent
for
you
just
now
because
this
telegram
has
come
for
a
telegram
for

meadows
her
hand
flew
out
but
miss
wyatt
held
the
telegram
back
a
moment
i
hope
it
not
bad
news
she
said
so
more
than
kindly
and
miss
meadows
tore
it
open
pay
no
attention
to
letter

have
been
mad
bought
basil
she
read
she
could
take
her
eyes
off
the
telegram

very
serious
said
miss
wyatt
leaning
forward
oh

miss
wyatt
blushed
miss
meadows
it
nothing
bad
at
all
it
and
she
gave
an
apologetic
little
laugh
it
from
my
fiance
saying
that

that

was
a
pause

another
pause

got
up
she
half
ran
towards
the
door
oh
just
one
minute
miss
meadows

miss
wyatt
i
must
say
i
do
approve
of
my
teachers
having
telegrams
sent
to
them
in
school
hours
unless
in
case
of
very
bad
news

as

wyatt
or
a
very
serious
accident
or
something
to
that
effect
good
news
miss
meadows
will
always
keep
you
on
the
wings
of
hope
of
love
of
joy
miss
meadows
sped
back
to
the
music
hall
up
the
aisle
up
the
steps
over
to
the
piano
page
mary
she
said
page
and
picking
up
the
yellow
chrysanthemum
she
held
it
to
her
lips
to
hide
her
smile
then
she
turned
to
the
girls
rapped
with
her
baton
page
girls
page

come
here
with
flowers
with
baskets
of
fruit
and
ribbons
to
boot
congratulate
stop
stop
cried
miss
meadows
this
is
awful
this
is
and
she
beamed
at
her
girls
what
the
matter
with
you
all
think
girls
think
of
what
you
singing
use
your
imaginations
flowers
baskets
of
fruit
and
ribbons
to
boot
and
miss
meadows
broke
off
do
look
so
doleful
girls
it
ought
to
sound
warm
joyful
eager
once
more
quickly
all
together
now
then
and
this
time
miss
meadows
voice
sounded
over
all
the
other
voices
full
deep
glowing
with
expression
the
stranger
it
seemed
to
the
little
crowd
on
the
wharf
that
she
was
never
going
to
move
again
there
she
lay
immense
motionless
on
the
grey
crinkled
water
a
loop
of
smoke
above
her
an
immense
flock
of
gulls
screaming
and
diving
after
the
galley
droppings
at
the
stern
you
could
just
see
little
couples
parading
little
flies
walking
up
and
down
the
dish
on
the
grey
crinkled
tablecloth
other
flies
clustered
and
swarmed
at
the
edge
now
there
was
a
gleam
of
white
on
the
lower
deck
the
cook
apron
or
the
stewardess
perhaps
now
a
tiny
black
spider
raced
up
the
ladder
on
to
the
bridge
in
the
front
of
the
crowd
a
man
dressed
very
well
very
snugly
in
a
grey
overcoat
grey
silk
scarf
thick
gloves
and
dark
felt
hat
marched
up
and
down
twirling
his
folded
umbrella
he
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
little
crowd
on
the
wharf
and
at
the
same
time
to
keep
them
together
he
was
something
between
the
and
the
shepherd
but
what
a
fool
what
a
fool
he
had
been
not
to
bring
any
glasses
there
was
a
pair
of
glasses
between
the
whole
lot
of
them
curious
thing
scott
that
none
of
us
thought
of
glasses
we
might
have
been
able
to
stir
up
a
bit
we
might
have
managed
a
little
signalling
hesitate
to
land
natives
harmless
or
welcome
awaits
you
all
is
forgiven
what
eh
hammond
quick
eager
glance
so
nervous
and
yet
so
friendly
and
confiding
took
in
everybody
on
the
wharf
roped
in
even
those
old
chaps
lounging
against
the
gangways
they
knew
every
of
them
that
hammond
was
on
that
boat
and
that
he
was
so
tremendously
excited
it
never
entered
his
head
not
to
believe
that
this
marvellous
fact
meant
something
to
them
too
it
warmed
his
heart
towards
them
they
were
he
decided
as
decent
a
crowd
of
people
those
old
chaps
over
by
the
gangways
too
fine
solid
old
chaps
what
chests
by
jove
and
he
squared
his
own
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
rocked
from
heel
to
toe
yes
my
wife
been
in
europe
for
the
last
ten
months
on
a
visit
to
our
eldest
girl
who
was
married
last
year
i
brought
her
up
here
as
far
as
salisbury
myself
so
i
thought
i
better
come
and
fetch
her
back
yes
yes
the
shrewd
grey
eyes
narrowed
again
and
searched
anxiously
quickly
the
motionless
liner
again
his
overcoat
was
unbuttoned
out
came
the
thin
watch
again
and
for
the
twentieth
fiftieth
hundredth
time
he
made
the
calculation
let
me
see
now
it
was
two
fifteen
when
the
doctor
launch
went
off
two
fifteen
it
is
now
exactly
minutes
past
four
that
is
to
say
the
doctor
been
gone
two
hours
and
thirteen
minutes
two
hours
and
thirteen
minutes
he
gave
a
queer
little
and
snapped
his
watch
to
again
but
i
think
we
should
have
been
told
if
there
was
anything
up
do
you
gaven
oh
yes
hammond
i
do
think
there
anything
to
anything
to
worry
about
said
gaven
knocking
out
his
pipe
against
the
heel
of
his
shoe
at
the
same
time
quite
so
quite
so
cried
hammond
dashed
annoying
he
paced
quickly
up
and
down
and
came
back
again
to
his
stand
between
and
scott
and
gaven
it
getting
quite
dark
too
and
he
waved
his
folded
umbrella
as
though
the
dusk
at
least
might
have
had
the
decency
to
keep
off
for
a
bit
but
the
dusk
came
slowly
spreading
like
a
slow
stain
over
the
water
little
jean
scott
dragged
at
her
hand
i
wan
my
tea
mammy
she
wailed
i
expect
you
do
said
hammond
i
expect
all
these
ladies
want
their
and
his
kind
flushed
almost
pitiful
glance
roped
them
all
in
again
he
wondered
whether
janey
was
having
a
final
cup
of
tea
in
the
saloon
out
there
he
hoped
so
he
thought
not
it
would
be
just
like
her
not
to
leave
the
deck
in
that
case
perhaps
the
deck
steward
would
bring
her
up
a
cup
if
he
been
there
he
have
got
it
for
her
somehow
and
for
a
moment
he
was
on
deck
standing
over
her
watching
her
little
hand
fold
round
the
cup
in
the
way
she
had
while
she
drank
the
only
cup
of
tea
to
be
got
on
board
but
now
he
was
back
here
and
the
lord
only
knew
when
that
cursed
captain
would
stop
hanging
about
in
the
stream
he
took
another
turn
up
and
down
up
and
down
he
walked
as
far
as
the
to
make
sure
his
driver
had
disappeared
back
he
swerved
again
to
the
little
flock
huddled
in
the
shelter
of
the
banana
crates
little
jean
scott
was
still
wanting
her
tea
poor
little
beggar
he
wished
he
had
a
bit
of
chocolate
on
him
here
jean
he
said
like
a
lift
up
and
easily
gently
he
swung
the
little
girl
on
to
a
higher
barrel
the
movement
of
holding
her
steadying
her
relieved
him
wonderfully
lightened
his
heart
hold
on
he
said
keeping
an
arm
round
her
oh
do
worry
about
jean
hammond
said
scott
that
all
right
scott
no
trouble
it
a
pleasure
jean
a
little
pal
of
mine
are
you
jean
yes
hammond
said
jean
and
she
ran
her
finger
down
the
dent
of
his
felt
hat
but
suddenly
she
caught
him
by
the
ear
and
gave
a
loud
scream
hammond
she
moving
look
she
coming
in
by
jove
so
she
was
at
last
she
was
slowly
slowly
turning
round
a
bell
sounded
far
over
the
water
and
a
great
spout
of
steam
gushed
into
the
air
the
gulls
rose
they
fluttered
away
like
bits
of
white
paper
and
whether
that
deep
throbbing
was
her
engines
or
his
heart
hammond
could
say
he
had
to
nerve
himself
to
bear
it
whatever
it
was
at
that
moment
old
captain
johnson
the
came
striding
down
the
wharf
a
leather
portfolio
under
his
arm
jean
be
all
right
said
scott
i
hold
he
was
just
in
time
hammond
had
forgotten
about
jean
he
sprang
away
to
greet
old
captain
johnson
well
captain
the
eager
nervous
voice
rang
out
again
you
taken
pity
on
us
at
it
no
good
blaming
me
hammond
wheezed
old
captain
johnson
staring
at
the
liner
you
got
hammond
on
board
ai
yer
yes
yes
said
hammond
and
he
kept
by
the
side
mrs
hammond
there
we
sha
be
long
now
with
her
telephone
the
thrum
of
her
screw
filling
the
air
the
big
liner
bore
down
on
them
cutting
sharp
through
the
dark
water
so
that
big
white
shavings
curled
to
either
side
hammond
and
the
kept
in
front
of
the
rest
hammond
took
off
his
hat
he
raked
the
decks
they
were
crammed
with
passengers
he
waved
his
hat
and
bawled
a
loud
strange
across
the
water
and
then
turned
round
and
burst
out
laughing
and
said
something
nothing
to
old
captain
johnson
seen
her
asked
the
no
not
yet
steady
wait
a
bit
and
suddenly
between
two
great
clumsy
idiots
get
out
of
the
way
there
he
signed
with
his
umbrella
he
saw
a
hand
raised
a
white
glove
shaking
a
handkerchief
another
moment
and
thank
god
thank
god
there
she
was
there
was
janey
there
was
hammond
yes
yes
yes
standing
by
the
rail
and
smiling
and
nodding
and
waving
her
handkerchief
well
that
first
class
first
class
well
well
well
he
positively
stamped
like
lightning
he
drew
out
his
and
offered
it
to
old
captain
johnson
have
a
cigar
captain
they
pretty
good
have
a
couple
here
and
he
pressed
all
the
cigars
in
the
case
on
the
i
a
couple
of
boxes
up
at
the
thenks
hammond
wheezed
old
captain
johnson
hammond
stuffed
the
back
his
hands
were
shaking
but
got
hold
of
himself
again
he
was
able
to
face
janey
there
she
was
leaning
on
the
rail
talking
to
some
woman
and
at
the
same
time
watching
him
ready
for
him
it
struck
him
as
the
gulf
of
water
closed
how
small
she
looked
on
that
huge
ship
his
heart
was
wrung
with
such
a
spasm
that
he
could
have
cried
out
how
little
she
looked
to
have
come
all
that
long
way
and
back
by
herself
just
like
her
though
just
like
janey
she
had
the
courage
of
a
and
now
the
crew
had
come
forward
and
parted
the
passengers
they
had
lowered
the
rails
for
the
gangways
the
voices
on
shore
and
the
voices
on
board
flew
to
greet
each
other
all
well
all
how
mother
much
hullo
jean
hillo
aun
emily
had
a
good
voyage
splendid
sha
be
long
now
not
long
the
engines
stopped
slowly
she
edged
to
the
make
way
there
make
way
make
way
and
the
wharf
hands
brought
the
heavy
gangways
along
at
a
sweeping
run
hammond
signed
to
janey
to
stay
where
she
was
the
old
stepped
forward
he
followed
as
to
ladies
first
or
any
rot
like
that
it
never
entered
his
head
after
you
captain
he
cried
genially
and
treading
on
the
old
heels
he
strode
up
the
gangway
on
to
the
deck
in
a
to
janey
and
janey
was
clasped
in
his
arms
well
well
well
yes
yes
here
we
are
at
last
he
stammered
it
was
all
he
could
say
and
janey
emerged
and
her
cool
little
voice
the
only
voice
in
the
world
for
him
said
well
darling
have
you
been
waiting
long
no
not
long
or
at
any
rate
it
did
matter
it
was
over
now
but
the
point
was
he
had
a
cab
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
was
she
ready
to
go
off
was
her
luggage
ready
in
that
case
they
could
cut
off
sharp
with
her
cabin
luggage
and
let
the
rest
go
hang
until
he
bent
over
her
and
she
looked
up
with
her
familiar
she
was
just
the
same
not
a
day
changed
just
as
he
always
known
her
she
laid
her
small
hand
on
his
sleeve
how
are
the
children
john
she
asked
hang
the
children
perfectly
well
never
better
in
their
have
they
sent
me
letters
yes
yes
of
course
i
left
them
at
the
hotel
for
you
to
digest
later
we
ca
go
quite
so
fast
said
she
i
got
people
to
say
to
and
then
there
the
as
his
face
fell
she
gave
his
arm
a
small
understanding
squeeze
if
the
captain
comes
off
the
bridge
i
want
you
to
thank
him
for
having
looked
after
your
wife
so
well
he
got
her
if
she
wanted
another
ten
minutes
as
he
gave
way
she
was
surrounded
the
whole
seemed
to
want
to
say
to
janey
dear
hammond
and
next
time
you
in
sydney
i
expect
darling
hammond
you
wo
forget
to
write
to
me
will
you
well
hammond
what
this
boat
would
have
been
without
you
it
was
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
that
she
was
by
far
the
most
popular
woman
on
board
and
she
took
it
all
just
as
usual
absolutely
composed
just
her
little
self
just
janey
all
over
standing
there
with
her
veil
thrown
back
hammond
never
noticed
what
his
wife
had
on
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whatever
she
wore
but
he
did
notice
that
she
wore
a
black
costume
did
they
call
it
with
white
frills
trimmings
he
supposed
they
were
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
all
this
while
janey
handed
him
round
john
dear
and
then
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
finally
they
did
escape
and
she
led
the
way
to
her
to
follow
janey
down
the
passage
that
she
knew
so
well
that
was
so
strange
to
him
to
part
the
green
curtains
after
her
and
to
step
into
the
cabin
that
had
been
hers
gave
him
exquisite
happiness
but
confound
it
the
stewardess
was
there
on
the
floor
strapping
up
the
rugs
that
the
last
hammond
said
the
stewardess
rising
and
pulling
down
her
cuffs
he
was
introduced
again
and
then
janey
and
the
stewardess
disappeared
into
the
passage
he
heard
whisperings
she
was
getting
the
tipping
business
over
he
supposed
he
sat
down
on
the
striped
sofa
and
took
his
hat
off
there
were
the
rugs
she
had
taken
with
her
they
looked
good
as
new
all
her
luggage
looked
fresh
perfect
the
labels
were
written
in
her
beautiful
little
clear
hand
mrs
john
mrs
john
hammond
he
gave
a
long
sigh
of
content
and
leaned
back
crossing
his
arms
the
strain
was
over
he
felt
he
could
have
sat
there
for
ever
sighing
his
relief
the
relief
at
being
rid
of
that
horrible
tug
pull
grip
on
his
heart
the
danger
was
over
that
was
the
feeling
they
were
on
dry
land
again
but
at
that
moment
janey
head
came
round
the
corner
darling
do
you
mind
i
just
want
to
go
and
say
to
the
hammond
started
up
i
come
with
no
no
she
said
do
bother
i
rather
not
i
not
be
a
and
before
he
could
answer
she
was
gone
he
had
half
a
mind
to
run
after
her
but
instead
he
sat
down
again
would
she
really
not
be
long
what
was
the
time
now
out
came
the
watch
he
stared
at
nothing
that
was
rather
queer
of
janey
was
it
why
could
she
have
told
the
stewardess
to
say
for
her
why
did
she
have
to
go
chasing
after
the
ship
doctor
she
could
have
sent
a
note
from
the
hotel
even
if
the
affair
had
been
urgent
urgent
did
it
could
it
mean
that
she
had
been
ill
on
the
voyage
she
was
keeping
something
from
him
that
was
it
he
seized
his
hat
he
was
going
off
to
find
that
fellow
and
to
wring
the
truth
out
of
him
at
all
costs
he
thought
he
noticed
just
something
she
was
just
a
touch
too
calm
too
steady
from
the
very
first
moment
the
curtains
rang
janey
was
back
he
jumped
to
his
feet
janey
have
you
been
ill
on
this
voyage
you
have
ill
her
airy
little
voice
mocked
him
she
stepped
over
the
rugs
and
came
up
close
touched
his
breast
and
looked
up
at
him
darling
she
said
do
frighten
me
of
course
i
have
whatever
makes
you
think
i
have
do
i
look
ill
but
hammond
did
see
her
he
only
felt
that
she
was
looking
at
him
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
worry
about
anything
she
was
here
to
look
after
things
it
was
all
right
everything
was
the
gentle
pressure
of
her
hand
was
so
calming
that
he
put
his
over
hers
to
hold
it
there
and
she
said
stand
still
i
want
to
look
at
you
i
have
seen
you
yet
had
your
beard
beautifully
trimmed
and
you
look
younger
i
think
and
decidedly
thinner
bachelor
life
agrees
with
agrees
with
me
he
groaned
for
love
and
caught
her
close
again
and
again
as
always
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
holding
something
that
never
was
quite
his
his
something
too
delicate
too
precious
that
would
fly
away
once
he
let
go
for
god
sake
let
get
off
to
the
hotel
so
that
we
can
be
by
ourselves
and
he
rang
the
bell
hard
for
some
one
to
look
sharp
with
the
luggage
walking
down
the
wharf
together
she
took
his
arm
he
had
her
on
his
arm
again
and
the
difference
it
made
to
get
into
the
cab
after
janey
to
throw
the
striped
blanket
round
them
both
to
tell
the
driver
to
hurry
because
neither
of
them
had
had
any
tea
no
more
going
without
his
tea
or
pouring
out
his
own
she
was
back
he
turned
to
her
squeezed
her
hand
and
said
gently
teasingly
in
the
special
voice
he
had
for
her
glad
to
be
home
again
dearie
she
smiled
she
even
bother
to
answer
but
gently
she
drew
his
hand
away
as
they
came
to
the
brighter
streets
we
got
the
best
room
in
the
hotel
he
said
i
would
be
put
off
with
another
and
i
asked
the
chambermaid
to
put
in
a
bit
of
a
fire
in
case
you
felt
chilly
she
a
nice
attentive
girl
and
i
thought
now
we
were
here
we
would
bother
to
go
home
but
spend
the
day
looking
round
and
leave
the
morning
after
does
that
suit
you
no
hurry
is
there
the
children
will
have
you
soon
enough
i
thought
a
day
might
make
a
nice
break
in
your
journey
eh
janey
have
you
taken
the
tickets
for
the
day
after
she
asked
i
should
think
i
have
he
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
and
took
out
his
bulging
here
we
are
i
reserved
a
carriage
to
cooktown
there
it
is
and
john
hammond
i
thought
we
might
as
well
do
ourselves
comfortably
and
we
do
want
other
people
butting
in
do
we
but
if
you
like
to
stop
here
a
bit
longer
oh
no
said
janey
quickly
not
for
the
world
the
day
after
then
and
the
children
but
they
had
reached
the
hotel
the
manager
was
standing
in
the
broad
porch
he
came
down
to
greet
them
a
porter
ran
from
the
hall
for
their
boxes
well
arnold
here
hammond
at
last
the
manager
led
them
through
the
hall
himself
and
pressed
the
hammond
knew
there
were
business
pals
of
his
sitting
at
the
little
hall
tables
having
a
drink
before
dinner
but
he
was
going
to
risk
interruption
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
they
could
think
what
they
pleased
if
they
did
understand
the
more
fools
they
and
he
stepped
out
of
the
lift
unlocked
the
door
of
their
room
and
shepherded
janey
in
the
door
shut
now
at
last
they
were
alone
together
he
turned
up
the
light
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
fire
blazed
he
flung
his
hat
on
to
the
huge
bed
and
went
towards
her
but
would
you
believe
it
again
they
were
interrupted
this
time
it
was
the
porter
with
the
luggage
he
made
two
journeys
of
it
leaving
the
door
open
in
between
taking
his
time
whistling
through
his
teeth
in
the
corridor
hammond
paced
up
and
down
the
room
tearing
off
his
gloves
tearing
off
his
scarf
finally
he
flung
his
overcoat
on
to
the
bedside
at
last
the
fool
was
gone
the
door
clicked
now
they
were
alone
said
hammond
i
feel
i
never
have
you
to
myself
again
these
cursed
people
janey
and
he
bent
his
flushed
eager
gaze
upon
her
have
dinner
up
here
if
we
go
down
to
the
restaurant
we
be
interrupted
and
then
there
the
confounded
music
the
music
praised
so
highly
applauded
so
loudly
last
night
we
sha
be
able
to
hear
each
other
speak
let
have
something
up
here
in
front
of
the
fire
it
too
late
for
tea
i
order
a
little
supper
shall
i
how
does
that
idea
strike
you
do
darling
said
janey
and
while
you
away
the
letters
oh
later
on
will
do
said
hammond
but
then
we
get
it
over
said
janey
and
i
first
have
time
to
oh
i
need
go
down
explained
hammond
i
just
ring
and
give
the
order
you
do
want
to
send
me
away
do
you
janey
shook
her
head
and
smiled
but
you
thinking
of
something
else
you
worrying
about
something
said
hammond
what
is
it
come
and
sit
here
come
and
sit
on
my
knee
before
the
i
just
unpin
my
hat
said
janey
and
she
went
over
to
the
she
gave
a
little
cry
what
is
it
nothing
darling
i
just
found
the
children
letters
that
all
right
they
will
keep
no
hurry
now
she
turned
to
him
clasping
them
she
tucked
them
into
her
frilled
blouse
she
cried
quickly
gaily
oh
how
typical
this
is
of
you
why
what
the
matter
with
it
said
hammond
if
it
were
floating
in
eternity
i
should
say
laughed
janey
staring
at
the
big
bottle
of
hair
tonic
the
wicker
bottle
of
the
two
and
a
dozen
new
collars
tied
with
pink
tape
is
this
all
your
luggage
hang
my
luggage
said
hammond
but
all
the
same
he
liked
being
laughed
at
by
janey
let
talk
let
get
down
to
things
tell
me
and
as
janey
perched
on
his
knees
he
leaned
back
and
drew
her
into
the
deep
ugly
chair
tell
me
you
really
glad
to
be
back
yes
darling
i
am
glad
she
said
but
just
as
when
he
embraced
her
he
felt
she
would
fly
away
so
hammond
never
knew
never
knew
for
dead
certain
that
she
was
as
glad
as
he
was
how
could
he
know
would
he
ever
know
would
he
always
have
this
craving
this
pang
like
hunger
somehow
to
make
janey
so
much
part
of
him
that
there
was
any
of
her
to
escape
he
wanted
to
blot
out
everybody
everything
he
wished
now
he
turned
off
the
light
that
might
have
brought
her
nearer
and
now
those
letters
from
the
children
rustled
in
her
blouse
he
could
have
chucked
them
into
the
fire
janey
he
whispered
yes
dear
she
lay
on
his
breast
but
so
lightly
so
remotely
their
breathing
rose
and
fell
together
janey
what
is
it
turn
to
me
he
whispered
a
slow
deep
flush
flowed
into
his
forehead
kiss
me
janey
you
kiss
me
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
a
tiny
pause
but
long
enough
for
him
to
suffer
torture
before
her
lips
touched
his
firmly
lightly
kissing
them
as
she
always
kissed
him
as
though
the
kiss
how
could
he
describe
it
confirmed
what
they
were
saying
signed
the
contract
but
that
was
what
he
wanted
that
was
at
all
what
he
thirsted
for
he
felt
suddenly
horrible
tired
if
you
knew
he
said
opening
his
eyes
what
it
been
like
waiting
i
thought
the
boat
never
would
come
in
there
we
were
hanging
about
what
kept
you
so
long
she
made
no
answer
she
was
looking
away
from
him
at
the
fire
the
flames
hurried
hurried
over
the
coals
flickered
fell
not
asleep
are
you
said
hammond
and
he
jumped
her
up
and
down
no
she
said
and
then
do
do
that
dear
no
i
was
thinking
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
said
one
of
the
passengers
died
last
night
a
man
that
what
held
us
up
we
brought
him
in
i
mean
he
was
buried
at
sea
so
of
course
the
ship
doctor
and
the
shore
doctor
what
was
it
asked
hammond
uneasily
he
hated
to
hear
of
death
he
hated
this
to
have
happened
it
was
in
some
queer
way
as
though
he
and
janey
had
met
a
funeral
on
their
way
to
the
hotel
oh
it
was
anything
in
the
least
infectious
said
janey
she
was
speaking
scarcely
above
her
breath
it
was
a
pause
poor
fellow
she
said
quite
and
she
watched
the
fire
flicker
and
fall
he
died
in
my
arms
said
janey
the
blow
was
so
sudden
that
hammond
thought
he
would
faint
he
move
he
could
breathe
he
felt
all
his
strength
flowing
flowing
into
the
big
dark
chair
and
the
big
dark
chair
held
him
fast
gripped
him
forced
him
to
bear
it
what
he
said
dully
what
that
you
say
the
end
was
quite
peaceful
said
the
small
voice
he
just
and
hammond
saw
her
lift
her
gentle
hand
breathed
his
life
away
at
the
and
her
hand
fell
who
else
was
there
hammond
managed
to
ask
nobody
i
was
alone
with
ah
my
god
what
was
she
saying
what
was
she
doing
to
him
this
would
kill
him
and
all
the
while
she
spoke
i
saw
the
change
coming
and
i
sent
the
steward
for
the
doctor
but
the
doctor
was
too
late
he
could
have
done
anything
but
why
you
why
you
moaned
hammond
at
that
janey
turned
quickly
quickly
searched
his
face
you
do
mind
john
do
you
she
asked
you
do
it
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
somehow
or
other
he
managed
to
shake
some
sort
of
smile
at
her
somehow
or
other
he
stammered
no
go
on
go
on
i
want
you
to
tell
but
john
darling
tell
me
janey
there
nothing
to
tell
she
said
wondering
he
was
one
of
the
passengers
i
saw
he
was
very
ill
when
he
came
on
board
but
he
seemed
to
be
so
much
better
until
yesterday
he
had
a
severe
attack
in
the
afternoon
excitement
nervousness
i
think
about
arriving
and
after
that
he
never
but
why
did
the
stewardess
oh
my
dear
the
stewardess
said
janey
what
would
he
have
felt
and
besides
he
might
have
wanted
to
leave
a
message
to
did
he
muttered
hammond
did
he
say
anything
no
darling
not
a
word
she
shook
her
head
softly
all
the
time
i
was
with
him
he
was
too
weak
he
was
too
weak
even
to
move
a
finger
janey
was
silent
but
her
words
so
light
so
soft
so
chill
seemed
to
hover
in
the
air
to
rain
into
his
breast
like
snow
the
fire
had
gone
red
now
it
fell
in
with
a
sharp
sound
and
the
room
was
colder
cold
crept
up
his
arms
the
room
was
huge
immense
glittering
it
filled
his
whole
world
there
was
the
great
blind
bed
with
his
coat
flung
across
it
like
some
headless
man
saying
his
prayers
there
was
the
luggage
ready
to
be
carried
away
again
anywhere
tossed
into
trains
carted
on
to
boats
he
was
too
weak
he
was
too
weak
to
move
a
and
yet
he
died
in
janey
arms
she
who
never
never
once
in
all
these
years
never
on
one
single
solitary
occasion
no
he
must
think
of
it
madness
lay
in
thinking
of
it
no
he
would
face
it
he
could
stand
it
it
was
too
much
to
bear
and
now
janey
touched
his
tie
with
her
fingers
she
pinched
the
edges
of
the
tie
together
you
not
sorry
i
told
you
john
darling
it
has
made
you
sad
it
has
spoilt
our
evening
our
being
alone
together
but
at
that
he
had
to
hide
his
face
he
put
his
face
into
her
bosom
and
his
arms
enfolded
her
spoilt
their
evening
spoilt
their
being
alone
together
they
would
never
be
alone
together

look
out
a
driven
by
a

chauffeur
comes
rushing
down

a
blonde
woman
pouting
leaning
forward
rushing
through
your
life
beware

a
heavy
he
holds
the
licence
across

the
sweat
pours
down
his
face
into
his
paper
collar
his
eyes
look
glazed
when
he
takes
off
his
hat
there
is
a
deep
pucker
of
angry
flesh
on
his
forehead
nobody
buys
a
watch
look
out
again
a
huge
barouche
comes
swinging
down
the
hill
with
two
old
old
babies
inside
she
holds
up
a
lace
parasol
he
sucks
the
knob
of
his
cane
and
the
fat
old
bodies
roll
together
as
the
cradle
rocks
and
the
steaming
horse
leaves
a
trail
of
manure
as
it
ambles
down
the
hill
under
a
tree
professor
leonard
in
cap
and
gown
stands
beside
his
banner
he
is
here
for
one
day
from
the
london
paris
and
brussels
exhibition
to
tell
your
fortune
from
your
face
and
he
stands
smiling
encouragement
like
a
clumsy
dentist
when
the
big
men
romping
and
swearing
a
moment
before
hand
across
their
sixpence
and
stand
before
him
they
are
suddenly
serious
dumb
timid
almost
blushing
as
the
professor
quick
hand
notches
the
printed
card
they
are
like
little
children
caught
playing
in
a
forbidden
garden
by
the
owner
stepping
from
behind
a
tree
the
top
of
the
hill
is
reached
how
hot
it
is
how
fine
it
is
the
is
open
and
the
crowd
presses
in
the
mother
sits
on
the
pavement
edge
with
her
baby
and
the
father
brings
her
out
a
glass
of
dark
brownish
stuff
and
then
savagely
elbows
his
way
in
again
a
reek
of
beer
floats
from
the
and
a
loud
clatter
and
rattle
of
voices
the
wind
has
dropped
and
the
sun
burns
more
fiercely
than
ever
outside
the
two
there
is
a
thick
mass
of
children
like
flies
at
the
mouth
of
a
and
up
up
the
hill
come
the
people
with
ticklers
and
golliwogs
and
roses
and
feathers
up
up
they
thrust
into
the
light
and
heat
shouting
laughing
squealing
as
though
they
were
being
pushed
by
something
far
below
and
by
the
sun
far
ahead
of
them
drawn
up
into
the
full
bright
dazzling
radiance
to
what
an
ideal
family
that
evening
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
as
he
pressed
through
the
swing
door
and
descended
the
three
broad
steps
to
the
pavement
old
neave
felt
he
was
too
old
for
the
spring
spring
warm
eager
restless
was
there
waiting
for
him
in
the
golden
light
ready
in
front
of
everybody
to
run
up
to
blow
in
his
white
beard
to
drag
sweetly
on
his
arm
and
he
could
meet
her
no
he
could
square
up
once
more
and
stride
off
jaunty
as
a
young
man
he
was
tired
and
although
the
late
sun
was
still
shining
curiously
cold
with
a
numbed
feeling
all
over
quite
suddenly
he
had
the
energy
he
had
the
heart
to
stand
this
gaiety
and
bright
movement
any
longer
it
confused
him
he
wanted
to
stand
still
to
wave
it
away
with
his
stick
to
say
be
off
with
you
suddenly
it
was
a
terrible
effort
to
greet
as
usual
tipping
his
with
his
stick
all
the
people
whom
he
knew
the
friends
acquaintances
shopkeepers
postmen
drivers
but
the
gay
glance
that
went
with
the
gesture
the
kindly
twinkle
that
seemed
to
say
i
a
match
and
more
for
any
of
you
that
old
neave
could
not
manage
at
all
he
stumped
along
lifting
his
knees
high
as
if
he
were
walking
through
air
that
had
somehow
grown
heavy
and
solid
like
water
and
the
crowd
hurried
by
the
trams
clanked
the
light
carts
clattered
the
big
swinging
cabs
bowled
along
with
that
reckless
defiant
indifference
that
one
knows
only
in
dreams
it
had
been
a
day
like
other
days
at
the
office
nothing
special
had
happened
harold
had
come
back
from
lunch
until
close
on
four
where
had
he
been
what
had
he
been
up
to
he
was
going
to
let
his
father
know
old
neave
had
happened
to
be
in
the
vestibule
saying
to
a
caller
when
harold
sauntered
in
perfectly
turned
out
as
usual
cool
suave
smiling
that
peculiar
little
that
women
found
so
fascinating
ah
harold
was
too
handsome
too
handsome
by
far
that
had
been
the
trouble
all
along
no
man
had
a
right
to
such
eyes
such
lashes
and
such
lips
it
was
uncanny
as
for
his
mother
his
sisters
and
the
servants
it
was
not
too
much
to
say
they
made
a
young
god
of
him
they
worshipped
harold
they
forgave
him
everything
and
he
had
needed
some
forgiving
ever
since
the
time
when
he
was
thirteen
and
he
had
stolen
his
mother
purse
taken
the
money
and
hidden
the
purse
in
the
bedroom
old
neave
struck
sharply
with
his
stick
upon
the
pavement
edge
but
it
was
only
his
family
who
spoiled
harold
he
reflected
it
was
everybody
he
had
only
to
look
and
to
smile
and
down
they
went
before
him
so
perhaps
it
was
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
expected
the
office
to
carry
on
the
tradition
h
h
but
it
could
be
done
no
business
not
even
a
successful
established
big
paying
concern
could
be
played
with
a
man
had
either
to
put
his
whole
heart
and
soul
into
it
or
it
went
all
to
pieces
before
his
eyes
and
then
charlotte
and
the
girls
were
always
at
him
to
make
the
whole
thing
over
to
harold
to
retire
and
to
spend
his
time
enjoying
himself
enjoying
himself
old
neave
stopped
dead
under
a
group
of
ancient
cabbage
palms
outside
the
government
buildings
enjoying
himself
the
wind
of
evening
shook
the
dark
leaves
to
a
thin
airy
cackle
sitting
at
home
twiddling
his
thumbs
conscious
all
the
while
that
his
work
was
slipping
away
dissolving
disappearing
through
harold
fine
fingers
while
harold
smiled
why
will
you
be
so
unreasonable
father
there
absolutely
no
need
for
you
to
go
to
the
office
it
only
makes
it
very
awkward
for
us
when
people
persist
in
saying
how
tired
you
looking
here
this
huge
house
and
garden
surely
you
could
be
happy
in
in
appreciating
it
for
a
change
or
you
could
take
up
some
and
lola
the
baby
had
chimed
in
loftily
all
men
ought
to
have
hobbies
it
makes
life
impossible
if
they
well
well
he
could
help
a
grim
smile
as
painfully
he
began
to
climb
the
hill
that
led
into
harcourt
avenue
where
would
lola
and
her
sisters
and
charlotte
be
if
he
gone
in
for
hobbies
he
like
to
know
hobbies
could
pay
for
the
town
house
and
the
seaside
bungalow
and
their
horses
and
their
golf
and
the
gramophone
in
the
for
them
to
dance
to
not
that
he
grudged
them
these
things
no
they
were
smart
girls
and
charlotte
was
a
remarkable
woman
it
was
natural
for
them
to
be
in
the
swim
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
other
house
in
the
town
was
as
popular
as
theirs
no
other
family
entertained
so
much
and
how
many
times
old
neave
pushing
the
cigar
box
across
the
table
had
listened
to
praises
of
his
wife
his
girls
of
himself
even
you
an
ideal
family
sir
an
ideal
family
it
like
something
one
reads
about
or
sees
on
the
that
all
right
my
boy
old
neave
would
reply
try
one
of
those
i
think
you
like
them
and
if
you
care
to
smoke
in
the
garden
you
find
the
girls
on
the
lawn
i
dare
that
was
why
the
girls
had
never
married
so
people
said
they
could
have
married
anybody
but
they
had
too
good
a
time
at
home
they
were
too
happy
together
the
girls
and
charlotte
h
h
well
well
perhaps
so
by
this
time
he
had
walked
the
length
of
fashionable
harcourt
avenue
he
had
reached
the
corner
house
their
house
the
carriage
gates
were
pushed
back
there
were
fresh
marks
of
wheels
on
the
drive
and
then
he
faced
the
big
house
with
its
windows
its
tulle
curtains
floating
outwards
its
blue
jars
of
hyacinths
on
the
broad
sills
on
either
side
of
the
carriage
porch
their
hydrangeas
famous
in
the
town
were
coming
into
flower
the
pinkish
bluish
masses
of
flower
lay
like
light
among
the
spreading
leaves
and
somehow
it
seemed
to
old
neave
that
the
house
and
the
flowers
and
even
the
fresh
marks
on
the
drive
were
saying
there
is
young
life
here
there
are
girls
the
hall
as
always
was
dusky
with
wraps
parasols
gloves
piled
on
the
oak
chests
from
the
sounded
the
piano
quick
loud
and
impatient
through
the
door
that
was
ajar
voices
floated
and
were
there
ices
came
from
charlotte
then
the
creak
creak
of
her
rocker
ices
cried
ethel
my
dear
mother
you
never
saw
such
ices
only
two
kinds
and
one
a
common
little
strawberry
shop
ice
in
a
sopping
wet
the
food
altogether
was
too
appalling
came
from
marion
still
it
rather
early
for
ices
said
charlotte
easily
but
why
if
one
has
them
at
all
began
ethel
oh
quite
so
darling
crooned
charlotte
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
lola
dashed
out
she
started
she
nearly
screamed
at
the
sight
of
old
neave
gracious
father
what
a
fright
you
gave
me
have
you
just
come
home
why
is
charles
here
to
help
you
off
with
your
coat
her
cheeks
were
crimson
from
playing
her
eyes
glittered
the
hair
fell
over
her
forehead
and
she
breathed
as
though
she
had
come
running
through
the
dark
and
was
frightened
old
neave
stared
at
his
youngest
daughter
he
felt
he
had
never
seen
her
before
so
that
was
lola
was
it
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
father
it
was
not
for
him
that
she
was
waiting
there
now
she
put
the
tip
of
her
crumpled
handkerchief
between
her
teeth
and
tugged
at
it
angrily
the
telephone
rang
lola
gave
a
cry
like
a
sob
and
dashed
past
him
the
door
of
the
slammed
and
at
the
same
moment
charlotte
called
is
that
you
father
you
tired
again
said
charlotte
reproachfully
and
she
stopped
the
rocker
and
offered
her
warm
cheek
ethel
pecked
his
beard
marion
lips
brushed
his
ear
did
you
walk
back
father
asked
charlotte
yes
i
walked
home
said
old
neave
and
he
sank
into
one
of
the
immense
chairs
but
why
did
you
take
a
cab
said
ethel
there
are
hundred
of
cabs
about
at
that
my
dear
ethel
cried
marion
if
father
prefers
to
tire
himself
out
i
really
do
see
what
business
of
ours
it
is
to
children
children
coaxed
charlotte
but
marion
would
be
stopped
no
mother
you
spoil
father
and
not
right
you
ought
to
be
stricter
with
him
he
very
she
laughed
her
hard
bright
laugh
and
patted
her
hair
in
a
mirror
strange
when
she
was
a
little
girl
she
had
such
a
soft
hesitating
voice
she
had
even
stuttered
and
now
whatever
she
said
even
if
it
was
only
jam
please
father
it
rang
out
as
though
she
were
on
the
stage
did
harold
leave
the
office
before
you
dear
asked
charlotte
beginning
to
rock
again
i
not
sure
said
old
neave
i
not
sure
i
did
see
him
after
four
he
said
began
charlotte
but
at
that
moment
ethel
who
was
twitching
over
the
leaves
of
some
paper
or
other
ran
to
her
mother
and
sank
down
beside
her
chair
there
you
see
she
cried
that
what
i
mean
mummy
yellow
with
touches
of
silver
do
you
agree
give
it
to
me
love
said
charlotte
she
fumbled
for
her
spectacles
and
put
them
on
gave
the
page
a
little
dab
with
her
plump
small
fingers
and
pursed
up
her
lips
very
sweet
she
crooned
vaguely
she
looked
at
ethel
over
her
spectacles
but
i
should
have
the
not
the
train
wailed
ethel
tragically
but
the
train
the
whole
here
mother
let
me
marion
snatched
the
paper
playfully
from
charlotte
i
agree
with
mother
she
cried
triumphantly
the
train
overweights
old
neave
forgotten
sank
into
the
broad
lap
of
his
chair
and
dozing
heard
them
as
though
he
dreamed
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
was
tired
out
he
had
lost
his
hold
even
charlotte
and
the
girls
were
too
much
for
him
they
were
too
too
but
all
his
drowsing
brain
could
think
of
was
too
rich
for
him
and
somewhere
at
the
back
of
everything
he
was
watching
a
little
withered
ancient
man
climbing
up
endless
flights
of
stairs
who
was
he
i
sha
dress
he
muttered
what
do
you
say
father
eh
what
what
old
neave
woke
with
a
start
and
stared
across
at
them
i
sha
dress
he
repeated
but
father
we
got
lucile
coming
and
henry
davenport
and
teddie
it
will
look
so
very
out
of
the
do
you
feel
well
dear
you
need
make
any
effort
what
is
charles
for
but
if
you
really
not
up
to
it
charlotte
wavered
very
well
very
well
old
neave
got
up
and
went
to
join
that
little
old
climbing
fellow
just
as
far
as
his
there
young
charles
was
waiting
for
him
carefully
as
though
everything
depended
on
it
he
was
tucking
a
towel
round
the
can
young
charles
had
been
a
favourite
of
his
ever
since
as
a
little
boy
he
had
come
into
the
house
to
look
after
the
fires
old
neave
lowered
himself
into
the
cane
lounge
by
the
window
stretched
out
his
legs
and
made
his
little
evening
joke
dress
him
up
charles
and
charles
breathing
intensely
and
frowning
bent
forward
to
take
the
pin
out
of
his
tie
h
h
well
well
it
was
pleasant
by
the
open
window
very
pleasant
a
fine
mild
evening
they
were
cutting
the
grass
on
the
tennis
court
below
he
heard
the
soft
churr
of
the
mower
soon
the
girls
would
begin
their
tennis
parties
again
and
at
the
thought
he
seemed
to
hear
marion
voice
ring
out
good
for
you
partner
oh
played
partner
oh
very
nice
then
charlotte
calling
from
the
veranda
where
is
harold
and
ethel
he
certainly
not
here
and
charlotte
vague
he
said
old
neave
sighed
got
up
and
putting
one
hand
under
his
beard
he
took
the
comb
from
young
charles
and
carefully
combed
the
white
beard
over
charles
gave
him
a
folded
handkerchief
his
watch
and
seals
and
spectacle
case
that
will
do
my
the
door
shut
he
sank
back
he
was
alone
and
now
that
little
ancient
fellow
was
climbing
down
endless
flights
that
led
to
a
glittering
gay
what
legs
he
had
they
were
like
a
spider
thin
withered
you
an
ideal
family
sir
an
ideal
but
if
that
were
true
why
did
charlotte
or
the
girls
stop
him
why
was
he
all
alone
climbing
up
and
down
where
was
harold
ah
it
was
no
good
expecting
anything
from
harold
down
down
went
the
little
old
spider
and
then
to
his
horror
old
neave
saw
him
slip
past
the
and
make
for
the
porch
the
dark
drive
the
carriage
gates
the
office
stop
him
stop
him
somebody
old
neave
started
up
it
was
dark
in
his
the
window
shone
pale
how
long
had
he
been
asleep
he
listened
and
through
the
big
airy
darkened
house
there
floated
voices
sounds
perhaps
he
thought
vaguely
he
had
been
asleep
for
a
long
time
he
been
forgotten
what
had
all
this
to
do
with
him
this
house
and
charlotte
the
girls
and
harold
what
did
he
know
about
them
they
were
strangers
to
him
life
had
passed
him
by
charlotte
was
not
his
wife
his
wife
a
dark
porch
half
hidden
by
a
that
drooped
sorrowful
mournful
as
though
it
understood
small
warm
arms
were
round
his
neck
a
face
little
and
pale
lifted
to
his
and
a
voice
breathed
my
my
treasure
my
treasure
which
of
them
had
spoken
why
had
they
said
there
had
been
some
terrible
mistake
she
was
his
wife
that
little
pale
girl
and
all
the
rest
of
his
life
had
been
a
dream
then
the
door
opened
and
young
charles
standing
in
the
light
put
his
hands
by
his
side
and
shouted
like
a
young
soldier
dinner
is
on
the
table
sir
i
coming
i
coming
said
old
neave
the
lady
maid
eleven
a
knock
at
the
door
i
hope
i
have
disturbed
you
madam
you
were
asleep
were
you
but
i
just
given
my
lady
her
tea
and
there
was
such
a
nice
cup
over
i
thought
perhaps
not
at
all
madam
i
always
make
a
cup
of
tea
last
thing
she
drinks
it
in
bed
after
her
prayers
to
warm
her
up
i
put
the
kettle
on
when
she
kneels
down
and
i
say
to
it
now
you
need
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
say
your
but
it
always
boiling
before
my
lady
is
half
through
you
see
madam
we
know
such
a
lot
of
people
and
they
all
got
to
be
prayed
for
every
one
my
lady
keeps
a
list
of
the
names
in
a
little
red
book
oh
dear
whenever
some
one
new
has
been
to
see
us
and
my
lady
says
afterwards
ellen
give
me
my
little
red
book
i
feel
quite
wild
i
do
there
another
i
think
keeping
her
out
of
her
bed
in
all
and
she
wo
have
a
cushion
you
know
madam
she
kneels
on
the
hard
carpet
it
fidgets
me
something
dreadful
to
see
her
knowing
her
as
i
do
i
tried
to
cheat
her
i
spread
out
the
eiderdown
but
the
first
time
i
did
it
oh
she
gave
me
such
a
look
holy
it
was
madam
did
our
lord
have
an
eiderdown
ellen
she
said
but
i
was
younger
at
the
time
i
felt
inclined
to
say
no
but
our
lord
was
your
age
and
he
did
know
what
it
was
to
have
your
wicked
was
it
but
she
too
good
you
know
madam
when
i
tucked
her
up
just
now
and
seen
saw
her
lying
back
her
hands
outside
and
her
head
on
the
pillow
so
pretty
i
could
help
thinking
now
you
look
just
like
your
dear
mother
when
i
laid
her
out
yes
madam
it
was
all
left
to
me
oh
she
did
look
sweet
i
did
her
hair
round
her
forehead
all
in
dainty
curls
and
just
to
one
side
of
her
neck
i
put
a
bunch
of
most
beautiful
purple
pansies
those
pansies
made
a
picture
of
her
madam
i
shall
never
forget
them
i
thought
when
i
looked
at
my
lady
now
if
only
the
pansies
was
there
no
one
could
tell
the
only
the
last
year
madam
only
after
she
got
a
little
well
feeble
as
you
might
say
of
course
she
was
never
dangerous
she
was
the
sweetest
old
lady
but
how
it
took
her
was
she
thought
she
lost
something
she
could
keep
still
she
settle
all
day
long
she
be
up
and
down
up
and
down
you
meet
her
everywhere
on
the
stairs
in
the
porch
making
for
the
kitchen
and
she
look
up
at
you
and
she
say
just
like
a
child
i
lost
it
i
lost
come
along
i
say
come
along
and
i
lay
out
your
patience
for
but
she
catch
me
by
the
hand
i
was
a
favourite
of
hers
and
whisper
find
it
for
me
ellen
find
it
for
sad
it
no
she
never
recovered
madam
she
had
a
stroke
at
the
end
last
words
she
ever
said
was
very
slow
look
in
the
look
in
and
then
she
was
gone
no
madam
i
ca
say
i
noticed
it
perhaps
some
girls
but
you
see
it
like
this
i
got
nobody
but
my
lady
my
mother
died
of
consumption
when
i
was
four
and
i
lived
with
my
grandfather
who
kept
a
shop
i
used
to
spend
all
my
time
in
the
shop
under
a
table
dressing
my
doll
hair
copying
the
assistants
i
suppose
they
were
ever
so
kind
to
me
used
to
make
me
little
wigs
all
colours
the
latest
fashions
and
all
and
there
i
sit
all
day
quiet
as
quiet
the
customers
never
knew
only
now
and
again
i
take
my
peep
from
under
the
but
one
day
i
managed
to
get
a
pair
of
scissors
and
would
you
believe
it
madam
i
cut
off
all
my
hair
snipped
it
off
all
in
bits
like
the
little
monkey
i
was
grandfather
was
furious
he
caught
hold
of
the
tongs
i
shall
never
forget
it
grabbed
me
by
the
hand
and
shut
my
fingers
in
them
that
teach
you
he
said
it
was
a
fearful
burn
i
got
the
mark
of
it
well
you
see
madam
he
taken
such
pride
in
my
hair
he
used
to
sit
me
up
on
the
counter
before
the
customers
came
and
do
it
something
beautiful
big
soft
curls
and
waved
over
the
top
i
remember
the
assistants
standing
round
and
me
ever
so
solemn
with
the
penny
grandfather
gave
me
to
hold
while
it
was
being
done
but
he
always
took
the
penny
back
afterwards
poor
grandfather
wild
he
was
at
the
fright
i
made
of
myself
but
he
frightened
me
that
time
do
you
know
what
i
did
madam
i
ran
away
yes
i
did
round
the
corners
in
and
out
i
do
know
how
far
i
did
run
oh
dear
i
must
have
looked
a
sight
with
my
hand
rolled
up
in
my
pinny
and
my
hair
sticking
out
people
must
have
laughed
when
they
saw
me
no
madam
grandfather
never
got
over
it
he
could
bear
the
sight
of
me
after
could
eat
his
dinner
even
if
i
was
there
so
my
aunt
took
me
she
was
a
cripple
an
upholstress
tiny
she
had
to
stand
on
the
sofas
when
she
wanted
to
cut
out
the
backs
and
it
was
helping
her
i
met
my
lady
not
so
very
madam
i
was
thirteen
turned
and
i
do
remember
ever
feeling
well
a
child
as
you
might
say
you
see
there
was
my
uniform
and
one
thing
and
another
my
lady
put
me
into
collars
and
cuffs
from
the
first
oh
yes
once
i
did
that
was
funny
it
was
like
this
my
lady
had
her
two
little
nieces
staying
with
her
we
were
at
sheldon
at
the
time
and
there
was
a
fair
on
the
common
now
ellen
she
said
i
want
you
to
take
the
two
young
ladies
for
a
ride
on
the
off
we
went
solemn
little
loves
they
were
each
had
a
hand
but
when
we
came
to
the
donkeys
they
were
too
shy
to
go
on
so
we
stood
and
watched
instead
beautiful
those
donkeys
were
they
were
the
first
i
seen
out
of
a
cart
for
pleasure
as
you
might
say
they
were
a
lovely
with
little
red
saddles
and
blue
bridles
and
bells
on
their
ears
and
quite
big
girls
older
than
me
even
were
riding
them
ever
so
gay
not
at
all
common
i
do
mean
madam
just
enjoying
themselves
and
i
do
know
what
it
was
but
the
way
the
little
feet
went
and
the
eyes
so
gentle
and
the
soft
ears
made
me
want
to
go
on
a
donkey
more
than
anything
in
the
world
of
course
i
could
i
had
my
young
ladies
and
what
would
i
have
looked
like
perched
up
there
in
my
uniform
but
all
the
rest
of
the
day
it
was
donkeys
donkeys
on
the
brain
with
me
i
felt
i
should
have
burst
if
i
did
tell
some
one
and
who
was
there
to
tell
but
when
i
went
to
bed
i
was
sleeping
in
james
bedroom
our
cook
that
was
at
the
time
as
soon
as
the
lights
was
out
there
they
were
my
donkeys
jingling
along
with
their
neat
little
feet
and
sad
eyes
well
madam
would
you
believe
it
i
waited
for
a
long
time
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
then
suddenly
i
sat
up
and
called
out
as
loud
as
i
could
i
do
want
to
go
on
a
donkey
i
do
want
a
you
see
i
had
to
say
it
and
i
thought
they
would
laugh
at
me
if
they
knew
i
was
only
dreaming
artful
was
it
just
what
a
silly
child
would
think
no
madam
never
now
of
course
i
did
think
of
it
at
one
time
but
it
was
to
be
he
had
a
little
just
down
the
road
and
across
from
where
we
was
living
funny
was
it
and
me
such
a
one
for
flowers
we
were
having
a
lot
of
company
at
the
time
and
i
was
in
and
out
of
the
shop
more
often
than
not
as
the
saying
is
and
harry
and
i
his
name
was
harry

to
quarrelling
about
how
things
ought
to
be
arranged
and
that
began
it

would
believe
it
madam
the
flowers
he
used
to
bring
me
he
stop
at
nothing
it
was
more
than
once
and
i
not
exaggerating
well
of
course
we
were
going
to
be
married
and
live
over
the
shop
and
it
was
all
going
to
be
just
so
and
i
was
to
have
the
window
to
arrange
oh
how
i
done
that
window
of

saturday

ever
forget

a
tuesday

lady
was
quite
herself
that
afternoon
not
that
she
said
anything
of
course
she
never
does
or
will
but
i
knew
by
the
way
that
she
kept
wrapping
herself
up
and
asking
me
if
it
was
cold
and
her
little
nose
looked
pinched
i
did
like
leaving
her
i
knew
i
be
worrying
all
the
time
at
last
i
asked
her
if
she
rather

put
it
off

she
said
you
must
mind
about
me
you
must
disappoint
your
young
and
so
cheerful
you
know
madam
never
thinking
about
herself
it
made
me
feel
worse
than
ever
i
began
to
wonder
then
she
dropped
her
handkerchief
and
began
to
stoop
down
to
pick
it
up
herself
a
thing
she
never
did
whatever
are
you
doing
i
cried
running
to
stop
her
well
she
said
smiling

shall
have
to
begin
to
oh
it
was
all
i
could
do
not
to
burst
out
crying
i
went
over
to
the
and
made
believe
to
rub
up
the
silver
and
i
could
keep
myself
in
and
i
asked
her
if
she
rather
i
did
get

she
said
that
was
her
voice

like
i
giving
you

not
for
the
wide
world

while
she
said
it

was
looking
in
her
glass
of

did
know
i
could
see
her
she
put
her
little
hand
on
her
heart
just
like
her
dear
mother
used
to
and
lifted
her
eyes

silver
bird

with
a
chain
in
its
beak

heart
with
a
dagger
