simon
the
jester
by
william
locke
chapter
i
i
met
renniker
the
other
day
at
the
club
he
is
a
man
who
knows
everything
from
the
method
of
trimming
a
puppy
tail
for
a
without
being
disqualified
to
the
innermost
workings
of
the
mind
of
every
european
potentate
if
i
want
information
on
any
subject
under
heaven
i
ask
renniker
can
you
tell
me
said
i
the
most
spot
in
england
renniker
being
in
a
flippant
mood
mentioned
a
fashionable
on
the
south
coast
i
pleaded
the
seriousness
of
my
question
what
i
want
said
i
is
a
place
compared
to
which
golgotha
aceldama
the
dead
sea
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
and
the
bowery
would
be
leafy
bowers
of
uninterrupted
then
is
what
you
looking
for
said
renniker
are
you
going
there
at
once
at
once
said
i
it
november
said
he
and
a
villainous
november
at
that
so
see
in
the
fine
flower
of
its
i
thanked
him
went
home
and
summoned
my
excellent
man
rogers
rogers
said
i
i
am
going
to
the
seaside
i
heard
that
murglebed
is
a
nice
quiet
little
spot
you
will
go
down
and
inspect
it
for
me
and
bring
back
a
he
went
blithe
and
though
he
thought
me
insane
he
returned
with
the
air
of
a
who
expecting
to
find
a
pantry
had
wandered
into
a
charnel
house
it
an
awful
place
sir
it
sixteen
miles
from
a
railway
station
the
shore
is
a
mud
flat
there
no
hotel
and
the
inhabitants
are
like
i
start
for
said
rogers
started
at
me
his
loose
mouth
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
preparing
to
cry
we
ca
possibly
stay
there
sir
he
remonstrated
are
not
going
to
try
i
retorted
i
going
by
his
face
brightened
almost
cheerfully
he
assured
me
that
i
should
find
nothing
to
eat
in
murglebed
you
can
amuse
yourself
said
i
by
sending
me
down
a
daily
hamper
of
there
is
even
a
church
he
continued
then
you
can
send
me
down
a
tin
one
from
humphreys
i
believe
they
can
supply
one
with
everything
from
a
tin
to
a
town
he
sighed
and
departed
and
the
next
day
i
found
myself
here
in
on
a
murky
sullen
november
day
murglebed
exhibits
unimagined
horrors
of
scenic
depravity
it
snarls
at
you
malignantly
it
is
like
a
bit
of
waste
land
in
gehenna
there
is
a
lowering
thing
a
mile
away
from
the
more
or
less
dry
land
which
local
ignorance
and
superstition
call
the
sea
the
interim
is
mud
oozy
brown
malevolent
mud
sometimes
it
seems
to
heave
as
if
with
the
myriad
bodies
of
slimy
crawling
eels
and
worms
and
snakes
a
few
foul
boats
lie
buried
in
it
here
and
there
on
land
a
surly
inhabitant
spits
into
it
if
you
address
him
he
snorts
at
you
unintelligibly
if
you
turn
your
back
to
the
sea
you
are
met
by
a
prospect
of
unimagined
despair
there
are
no
trees
the
country
is
flat
and
barren
a
dismal
creek
runs
miles
inland
an
estuary
fed
by
the
river
murgle
a
few
battered
cottages
a
general
shop
a
couple
of
low
and
three
perky
villas
all
in
a
row
form
the
city
or
town
or
village
or
what
you
will
of
renniker
is
a
wonderful
man
i
have
rented
a
couple
of
furnished
rooms
in
one
of
the
villas
it
has
a
decayed
bit
of
front
garden
in
which
a
gnarled
stunted
stick
is
planted
and
it
is
called
the
laburnums
my
landlord
the
owner
of
the
villas
is
a
builder
what
profits
he
can
get
from
building
in
murglebed
heaven
alone
knows
but
as
he
mounts
a
bicycle
in
the
morning
and
disappears
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
presume
he
careers
over
the
waste
building
as
he
goes
in
the
evenings
he
gets
drunk
at
the
red
cow
so
i
know
little
of
him
save
that
he
is
a
man
with
a
moustache
like
a
and
two
great
hands
like
hams
his
wife
is
taciturn
almost
to
dumbness
she
is
a
woman
and
looks
at
me
disapprovingly
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
as
if
i
were
a
blackbeetle
which
she
would
like
to
squash
under
foot
she
tolerates
me
however
on
account
of
the
tongues
and
other
sustenance
sent
by
rogers
from
benoist
of
which
she
consumes
prodigious
quantities
she
wonders
as
far
as
the
power
of
wonder
is
given
to
her
dull
brain
what
on
earth
i
am
doing
here
i
see
her
whispering
to
her
friends
as
i
enter
the
house
and
i
know
they
are
wondering
what
i
am
doing
here
the
whole
village
regards
me
as
a
humorous
zoological
freak
and
wonders
what
i
am
doing
here
among
normal
human
beings
and
what
am
i
doing
here
i
simon
de
gex
the
spoilt
darling
of
fortune
as
my
opponent
in
the
labour
interest
called
me
during
the
last
electoral
campaign
my
disciple
and
secretary
young
dale
kynnersley
the
only
mortal
besides
rogers
who
knows
my
whereabouts
trembles
for
my
reason
in
the
eyes
of
the
excellent
rogers
i
am
what
my
constituents
would
think
did
they
see
me
taking
the
muddy
air
on
a
soggy
afternoon
i
have
no
conception
dale
keeps
them
at
bay
he
also
baffles
the
curiosity
of
my
sisters
and
by
his
diplomacy
has
sent
eleanor
faversham
on
a
huffy
trip
to
sicily
she
can
not
understand
why
i
bury
myself
in
bleak
solitude
instead
of
making
cheerful
holiday
among
the
oranges
and
lemons
of
the
south
eleanor
is
a
girl
with
a
thousand
virtues
each
of
which
she
expects
to
find
in
counterpart
in
the
man
to
whom
she
is
affianced
until
a
week
or
two
ago
i
actually
thought
myself
in
love
with
eleanor
there
seemed
a
whimsical
attraction
in
the
idea
of
marrying
a
girl
with
a
thousand
virtues
before
me
lay
the
pleasant
prospect
of
reducing
them
say
ten
at
a
time
until
i
reached
the
limit
at
which
life
was
possible
and
then
one
by
one
until
life
became
entertaining
i
admired
her
exceedingly
a
strapping
healthy
english
girl
who
looked
you
straight
in
the
eyes
and
gripped
you
fearlessly
by
the
hand
my
friends
me
until
i
began
to
smirk
to
myself
at
my
own
good
fortune
she
visited
the
constituency
and
comported
herself
as
if
she
had
been
a
member
wife
since
infancy
thereby
causing
my
heart
to
swell
with
noble
pride
this
unparalleled
young
person
compelled
me
to
take
my
engagement
almost
seriously
if
i
shot
forth
a
jest
it
struck
against
a
virtue
and
fell
blunted
to
the
earth
indeed
even
now
i
am
sorry
i
ca
marry
eleanor
but
marriage
is
out
of
the
question
i
have
been
told
by
the
highest
medical
authorities
that
i
may
manage
to
wander
in
the
flesh
about
this
planet
for
another
six
months
after
that
i
shall
have
to
do
what
wandering
i
yearn
for
through
the
medium
of
my
ghost
there
is
a
certain
humourousness
in
the
prospect
save
for
an
occasional
pain
somewhere
inside
me
i
am
in
the
most
robust
health
but
this
same
little
pain
has
been
diagnosed
by
the
faculty
as
the
symptom
of
an
obscure
disease
an
operation
they
tell
me
would
kill
me
on
the
spot
what
it
is
called
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
remember
they
gave
it
a
kind
of
lingering
name
which
i
wrote
down
on
my
the
name
or
characteristics
of
the
thing
however
do
not
matter
a
fig
i
have
always
hated
people
who
talked
about
their
insides
and
i
am
not
going
to
talk
about
mine
even
to
myself
clearly
if
it
is
only
going
to
last
me
six
months
it
is
not
worth
talking
about
but
the
quaint
fact
of
its
brief
duration
is
worth
the
attention
of
a
contemplative
mind
it
is
in
order
perfectly
to
focus
this
attention
that
i
have
come
to
here
i
am
alone
with
the
murk
and
the
mud
and
my
own
indrawn
breath
of
life
there
are
no
flowers
blue
sky
smiling
eyes
and
dainty
faces
none
of
the
adventitious
distractions
of
the
earth
there
are
no
before
the
faculty
made
their
jocular
pronouncement
i
had
been
filling
my
head
with
statistics
on
pauper
lunacy
so
as
to
please
my
constituency
in
which
the
rate
has
increased
alarmingly
of
late
years
perhaps
that
is
why
i
found
myself
their
representative
in
parliament
i
was
to
father
a
bill
on
the
subject
next
session
now
the
labour
will
fall
on
other
shoulders
i
interest
myself
in
pauper
lunacy
no
more
a
man
requires
less
flippant
occupation
for
the
premature
sunset
of
his
days
well
in
murglebed
i
can
think
i
can
weigh
the
and
of
existence
with
an
even
mind
i
can
accustom
myself
to
the
concept
of
a
great
britain
without
simon
de
gex
of
course
when
i
go
i
shall
cast
one
longing
lingering
look
i
do
particularly
want
to
die
in
fact
having
otherwise
the
prospect
of
an
entertaining
life
i
regard
my
impending
dissolution
in
the
light
of
a
grievance
but
i
am
not
afraid
i
shall
go
through
the
dismal
formality
with
a
graceful
air
and
as
much
of
a
smile
on
my
face
as
the
pain
in
my
inside
will
physically
permit
my
dear
but
somewhat
friend
marcus
aurelius
says
let
death
surprise
me
when
it
will
and
where
it
will
i
may
be
or
a
happy
man
nevertheless
for
he
is
a
happy
man
who
in
his
lifetime
dealeth
unto
himself
a
happy
lot
and
portion
a
happy
lot
and
portion
in
good
inclinations
of
the
soul
good
desires
good
the
word
according
to
the
above
definition
tickles
my
fancy
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
be
eumoirous
what
a
thing
to
say
i
have
achieved
eumoiriety
namely
the
quintessence
of
dealt
unto
oneself
by
a
perfect
altruism
i
do
think
that
hitherto
my
soul
has
been
very
evilly
inclined
my
desires
base
or
my
actions
those
of
a
scoundrel
still
the
negatives
do
not
qualify
one
for
eumoiriety
one
wants
something
positive
i
have
an
idea
therefore
of
actively
dealing
unto
myself
a
happy
lot
or
portion
according
to
the
marcian
definition
during
the
rest
of
the
time
i
am
allowed
to
breathe
the
upper
air
and
this
will
be
fairly
easy
for
no
matter
how
excellently
a
man
soul
may
be
inclined
to
the
performance
of
a
good
action
in
ninety
cases
out
of
a
hundred
he
is
driven
away
from
it
by
dread
of
the
consequences
your
moral
teachers
seldom
think
of
this
that
the
consequences
of
a
good
action
are
often
more
disastrous
than
those
of
an
evil
one
but
if
a
man
is
going
to
die
he
can
do
good
with
impunity
he
can
simply
wallow
in
practical
virtue
when
the
boomerang
of
his
beneficence
comes
back
to
hit
him
on
the
head
wo
be
there
to
feel
he
can
thus
hoist
destiny
with
its
own
petard
and
besides
being
eumoirous
can
spend
a
month
or
two
in
a
peculiarly
diverting
manner
the
more
i
think
of
the
idea
the
more
am
i
in
love
with
it
i
am
going
to
have
a
seraph
of
a
time
i
am
going
to
play
the
archangel
i
shall
always
have
pleasant
memories
of
murglebed
such
an
idea
could
not
have
germinated
in
any
other
atmosphere
in
the
scented
groves
of
sunny
lands
there
would
have
been
sown
seeds
of
regret
which
would
have
blossomed
eventually
into
flowers
of
despair
i
should
have
gone
about
the
world
a
modern
admetus
snivelling
at
my
accursed
luck
without
even
the
chance
of
persuading
a
alcestis
to
die
for
me
i
should
have
been
a
dismal
nuisance
to
society
bless
you
i
cried
this
afternoon
waving
as
i
leaned
against
a
post
my
hand
to
the
ambient
mud
renniker
was
wrong
you
are
not
a
place
you
are
impregnated
with
divine
a
muddy
man
in
a
blue
jersey
and
filthy
beard
who
occupied
the
next
post
looked
at
me
and
spat
contemptuously
i
laughed
if
you
were
marcus
aurelius
said
i
i
would
make
a
joke
a
short
life
and
an
eumoiry
one
and
he
would
have
looked
as
pained
as
what
he
bawled
he
was
to
windward
of
me
i
knew
that
if
i
repeated
my
observation
he
would
offer
to
fight
me
i
approached
him
suavely
i
was
wondering
i
said
as
it
impossible
to
strike
a
match
in
this
wind
whether
you
would
let
me
light
my
pipe
from
it
empty
he
growled
take
a
fill
from
my
pouch
said
i
the
loaded
his
pipe
handed
me
my
pouch
without
acknowledgment
stuck
his
pipe
in
his
breeches
pocket
spat
again
and
deliberately
turning
his
back
on
me
lounged
off
to
another
post
on
a
remoter
and
less
portion
of
the
shore
again
i
laughed
feeling
as
the
poet
did
with
the
daffodils
that
one
could
not
but
be
gay
in
such
a
jocund
company
there
are
no
amenities
or
urbanities
of
life
in
murglebed
to
choke
the
growth
of
the
idea
this
evening
it
flourishes
so
exceedingly
that
i
think
it
safe
to
transplant
it
in
the
alien
soil
of
q
the
albany
where
the
good
rogers
must
be
leading
an
idle
existence
peculiarly
deleterious
to
his
morals
this
gives
one
furiously
to
think
one
of
the
responsibilities
of
eumoiriety
must
be
the
encouragement
and
development
of
virtue
in
my
manservant
also
in
my
young
friend
and
secretary
dale
kynnersley
he
is
more
to
me
than
rogers
i
may
confess
that
so
long
as
rogers
is
a
sober
honest
valet
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
do
care
a
hang
about
rogers
morals
but
about
those
of
dale
kynnersley
i
do
i
care
a
great
deal
for
his
career
and
happiness
i
have
a
notion
that
he
is
erring
after
strange
goddesses
and
neglecting
the
little
girl
who
is
in
love
with
him
he
must
be
delivered
he
must
marry
maisie
ellerton
and
the
two
of
them
must
bring
lots
of
capable
kynnersleys
into
the
world
i
long
to
be
their
ghostly
godfather
then
there
eleanor
faversham
but
if
i
begin
to
draw
up
a
programme
i
shall
lose
that
spontaneity
of
effort
which
i
take
it
is
one
of
the
chief
charms
of
dealing
unto
oneself
a
happy
lot
and
portion
no
my
soul
abhors
tabulation
it
would
make
even
six
months
life
as
jocular
as
bradshaw
railway
guide
or
the
dietary
of
a
prison
i
prefer
to
look
on
what
is
before
me
as
a
high
adventure
and
with
that
prospect
in
view
i
propose
to
jot
down
my
experiences
from
time
to
time
so
that
when
i
am
wandering
a
pale
shade
by
acheron
young
dale
kynnersley
may
have
not
only
documentary
evidence
wherewith
to
convince
my
friends
and
relations
that
my
latter
actions
were
not
those
of
a
lunatic
but
also
at
the
same
time
an
version
of
jeremy
taylor
edifying
though
treatise
on
the
act
of
dying
which
i
am
sorely
tempted
to
label
the
rule
and
example
of
i
shall
resist
the
temptation
however
dale
kynnersley
such
is
the
ignorance
of
the
new
generation
would
have
no
sense
of
the
allusion
he
would
shake
his
head
and
say
dotty
poor
old
chap
dotty
i
can
hear
him
and
if
in
order
to
prepare
him
i
gave
him
a
copy
of
the
meditations
he
would
fling
the
book
across
the
room
and
qualify
marcus
aurelius
as
a
dale
is
a
very
shrewd
fellow
and
will
make
an
admirable
legislator
when
his
time
comes
although
his
highest
intellectual
recreation
is
reiterated
attendance
at
the
musical
comedy
that
has
caught
his
fancy
for
the
moment
and
his
favourite
literature
the
sporting
pages
of
the
daily
papers
he
has
a
curious
feline
pounce
on
the
salient
facts
of
a
political
situation
and
can
thread
the
mazes
of
statistics
with
the
certainty
of
a
hampton
court
guide
his
enthusiastic
researches
on
my
behalf
into
pauper
lunacy
are
remarkable
in
one
so
young
i
foresee
him
an
invaluable
chairman
of
committee
but
he
will
never
become
a
statesman
he
has
too
passionate
a
faith
in
facts
and
figures
and
has
not
cultivated
a
sense
of
humour
at
the
expense
of
the
philosophers
young
men
who
do
not
read
them
lose
a
great
deal
of
fun
well
i
leave
murglebed
for
ever
it
has
my
benison
democritus
returns
to
london
chapter
ii
i
was
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
in
london
when
dale
kynnersley
rushed
in
and
seized
me
violently
by
the
hand
by
jove
here
you
are
at
last
i
smoothed
my
crushed
fingers
you
have
such
a
vehement
manner
of
proclaiming
the
obvious
my
dear
oh
rot
he
said
here
rogers
give
me
some
tea
and
i
think
have
some
toast
and
have
you
breakfasted
a
cloud
overspread
his
ingenuous
countenance
i
came
down
late
and
everything
was
cold
and
mother
was
on
edge
the
girls
are
always
doing
the
wrong
things
and
i
never
do
the
right
ones
you
know
the
mater
so
i
swallowed
a
tepid
kidney
and
rushed
save
for
her
worries
over
you
urchins
said
i
i
hope
lady
kynnersley
is
well
he
filled
his
mouth
with
toast
and
marmalade
and
nodded
he
is
a
boy
idyllic
age
he
has
sleek
black
hair
brushed
back
from
his
forehead
over
his
head
an
olive
complexion
and
a
keen
open
face
he
wore
a
lounge
suit
and
a
tie
and
looked
immaculate
i
remember
him
as
the
grubbiest
little
wretch
that
ever
disgraced
harrow
he
swallowed
his
mouthful
and
drank
some
tea
recovered
your
sanity
he
asked
the
dangerous
symptoms
have
passed
over
i
replied
i
undertake
not
to
he
regarded
me
as
though
he
were
not
quite
certain
and
asked
in
his
pronounless
way
whether
i
was
glad
to
be
back
in
london
yes
said
i
rogers
is
the
only
human
creature
who
can
properly
wax
the
ends
of
my
moustache
it
got
horribly
limp
in
the
air
of
murglebed
that
is
the
one
and
only
disadvantage
of
the
does
seem
to
have
done
you
much
good
he
remarked
scanning
me
critically
you
are
as
white
as
you
were
before
you
went
away
why
the
blazes
you
did
go
to
madeira
or
the
south
of
france
or
south
africa
i
ca
i
do
suppose
you
can
said
i
any
news
i
should
think
i
have
but
first
let
me
go
through
the
he
consulted
a
on
december
i
was
to
dine
with
company
and
reply
to
the
toast
of
the
house
of
on
the
my
constituency
claimed
me
for
the
opening
of
a
bazaar
at
wymington
a
little
later
i
was
to
speak
somewhere
in
the
north
of
england
at
a
in
support
of
the
party
candidate
it
will
be
fought
on
tariff
reform
about
which
i
know
nothing
i
objected
i
know
everything
he
declared
i
see
you
through
you
must
buck
up
a
bit
simon
and
get
your
name
better
known
about
the
country
and
this
brings
me
to
my
news
i
was
talking
to
raggles
the
other
day
he
dropped
a
hint
and
raggles
hints
are
jolly
well
worth
while
picking
up
just
come
to
the
front
and
show
yourself
and
there
a
place
in
the
ministry
sanderson
sanderson
i
queried
interested
in
spite
of
myself
at
these
puerilities
what
the
matter
with
him
swelled
head
there
have
been
awful
rows
this
is
confidential
and
he
got
the
hump
thinks
he
ought
to
be
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
or
at
least
first
lord
instead
of
an
under
secretary
so
he
going
to
chuck
it
before
he
gets
the
chuck
himself
see
i
perceive
said
i
that
your
conversational
english
style
is
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
continued
loftily
taking
no
notice
of
my
rebuke
there
bound
to
be
a
vacancy
why
should
you
fill
it
they
seem
to
want
you
you
miles
away
over
the
heads
of
the
average
solemn
duffers
who
get
i
bowed
acknowledgment
of
his
tribute
well
you
will
buck
up
and
try
for
it
wo
you
i
awfully
proud
of
you
already
but
i
should
go
off
my
head
with
joy
if
you
were
in
the
i
met
his
honest
young
eyes
as
well
as
i
could
how
was
i
going
to
convey
to
his
candid
intelligence
the
fact
of
my
speedy
withdrawal
from
political
life
without
shattering
his
illusions
besides
his
devotion
touched
me
and
his
generous
aspirations
were
so
futile
office
it
was
in
my
grasp
raggles
with
his
finger
always
on
the
pulse
of
the
party
machine
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
talk
nonsense
i
only
had
to
buck
yet
by
the
time
sanderson
sends
in
his
resignation
to
the
king
of
england
i
shall
have
sent
in
mine
to
the
king
of
hosts
i
moved
slightly
in
my
chair
and
a
twinge
of
the
little
pain
inside
brought
a
gasp
to
my
throat
but
i
felt
grateful
to
it
it
was
saving
me
from
an
unconscionable
deal
of
worry
fancy
going
to
a
confounded
office
every
morning
like
a
clerk
in
the
city
i
was
happier
at
peace
i
rose
and
warmed
myself
by
the
fire
dale
regarded
me
uncomprehendingly
you
look
as
if
the
prospect
bored
you
to
tears
i
thought
you
would
be
said
i
rot
said
dale
it
i
must
fetch
eleanor
faversham
back
from
sicily
said
dale
do
said
i
well
i
give
you
up
he
declared
pushing
his
chair
from
the
table
and
swinging
one
leg
across
the
other
i
leaned
forward
and
scrutinised
his
ankles
what
are
you
looking
at
there
must
be
something
radically
wrong
with
you
dale
i
murmured
sympathetically
it
is
part
of
the
religion
of
your
generation
to
wear
socks
to
match
your
tie
your
tie
is
and
your
socks
are
green
good
lord
he
cried
so
they
are
i
dressed
myself
anyhow
this
what
wrong
with
you
he
threw
his
cigarette
impatiently
into
the
fire
every
infernal
thing
that
can
possibly
be
everything
rotten
but
i
not
come
here
to
talk
about
why
not
it
is
the
game
i
here
on
your
business
which
is
ever
so
much
more
important
than
mine
where
are
this
morning
letters
i
pointed
to
an
unopened
heap
on
a
at
the
end
of
the
room
he
crossed
and
sat
down
before
them
presently
he
turned
sharply
you
have
looked
through
the
envelopes
here
is
one
from
i
took
the
letter
from
him
and
sighed
to
myself
as
i
read
it
eleanor
was
miserable
the
sicilians
were
dirty
the
duomo
of
palermo
did
not
come
up
to
her
expectations
the
with
whom
she
travelled
quarrelled
with
their
food
they
had
never
even
heard
of
theocritus
she
had
a
cold
in
her
head
and
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
explain
my
attitude
therefore
she
was
coming
back
to
london
i
wish
i
could
find
her
a
nice
tame
husband
who
had
heard
of
theocritus
it
would
be
such
a
good
thing
for
everybody
husband
included
for
i
repeat
eleanor
is
a
young
woman
of
fine
character
and
the
man
to
whom
she
gives
her
heart
will
be
a
fortunate
fellow
while
i
was
reading
the
letter
and
meditating
on
it
with
my
back
to
the
fire
dale
plunged
into
the
morning
correspondence
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
that
is
the
astonishing
thing
about
him
he
loves
work
the
more
i
give
him
to
do
the
better
he
likes
it
his
cronies
who
in
raiment
manners
and
tastes
differ
from
him
no
more
than
a
row
of
pins
differs
from
a
stray
brother
regard
a
as
a
mediaeval
instrument
of
torture
and
faint
at
the
sight
of
ink
they
will
put
themselves
to
all
kinds
of
physical
and
pecuniary
inconvenience
in
order
to
avoid
regular
employment
they
are
the
tramps
of
the
fashionable
world
but
in
vain
do
they
sing
to
dale
of
the
joys
of
and
vagabondage
and
deride
his
habits
of
industry
dale
turns
a
deaf
ear
to
them
and
urges
on
his
strenuous
career
rogers
coming
in
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
things
was
despatched
by
my
young
friend
to
fetch
a
portfolio
from
the
hall
it
contained
he
informed
me
the
unanswered
letters
of
the
past
fortnight
with
which
he
had
found
himself
unqualified
to
deal
he
grasped
the
whole
bundle
of
correspondence
and
invited
me
to
follow
him
to
the
library
and
start
on
a
solid
morning
work
i
obeyed
meekly
he
sat
down
at
the
big
table
arranged
the
pile
in
front
of
him
took
a
pencil
from
the
tray
and
began
this
is
from
finch
of
the
i
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
tell
him
my
boy
that
it
against
my
custom
to
breakfast
at
afternoon
tea
and
that
i
hope
his
wife
is
at
his
look
of
bewilderment
i
broke
into
a
laugh
he
wants
me
to
write
a
dull
article
for
his
stupid
paper
does
he
yes
on
poor
law
i
not
going
to
do
it
i
not
going
to
do
anything
these
people
ask
me
say
no
no
no
to
in
heaven
name
simon
he
cried
laying
down
his
pencil
what
has
come
over
you
old
age
said
i
he
uttered
his
usual
interjection
and
added
that
i
was
only
age
is
a
relative
thing
i
remarked
babes
of
five
have
been
known
to
die
of
senile
decay
and
i
have
seen
irresponsible
striplings
of
i
really
think
eleanor
faversham
had
better
come
back
from
i
tapped
the
letter
still
in
my
hand
she
i
jolly
glad
to
hear
it
it
all
my
silly
fault
that
she
went
away
i
thought
she
was
getting
on
your
nerves
but
you
want
pulling
together
that
confounded
place
you
been
to
has
utterly
upset
on
the
contrary
said
i
it
has
steadied
and
amplified
my
conception
of
sublunary
affairs
it
has
shown
me
that
motley
is
much
more
profitable
wear
than
the
edged
toga
of
the
senator
oh
for
god
sake
dry
up
cried
young
england
and
tell
me
what
answers
i
to
give
these
people
he
seemed
so
earnest
about
it
that
i
humoured
him
and
my
correspondents
seemed
so
earnest
that
i
humoured
them
but
it
was
a
grim
jest
most
of
the
matters
with
which
i
had
to
deal
appeared
so
trivial
only
here
and
there
did
i
find
a
chance
for
eumoiriety
the
wymington
hospital
applied
for
their
annual
donation
you
generally
give
a
tenner
said
dale
this
time
i
give
them
a
couple
of
hundred
said
dale
earmarked
the
amount
wonderingly
but
when
i
ordered
him
to
send
five
pounds
apiece
to
the
authors
of
various
begging
letters
he
argued
vehemently
and
quoted
the
charity
organisation
society
they
frauds
all
of
them
he
maintained
they
poor
necessitous
devils
at
any
rate
said
i
and
they
want
the
money
more
than
i
this
was
a
truth
whose
significance
dale
was
far
from
realising
of
what
value
indeed
is
money
to
me
there
is
none
to
whom
i
can
usefully
bequeath
my
little
fortune
my
sisters
having
each
married
rich
men
i
shall
not
need
even
charon
obolus
when
i
am
dead
for
we
have
ceased
to
believe
in
him
which
is
a
pity
as
the
trip
across
the
styx
must
have
been
picturesque
why
then
should
i
not
deal
myself
a
happy
lot
and
portion
by
squandering
my
money
benevolently
during
my
lifetime
it
behooves
me
however
to
walk
warily
in
this
as
in
other
matters
for
if
my
actions
too
closely
resemble
those
of
a
lunatic
at
large
trustees
may
be
appointed
to
administer
my
affairs
which
would
frustrate
my
plans
entirely
when
my
part
in
the
morning
work
was
over
i
informed
my
secretary
that
i
would
go
out
and
take
the
air
till
if
you
nothing
better
to
do
said
he
you
might
run
round
to
eccleston
square
and
see
my
for
any
particular
reason
she
wants
to
see
you
home
for
inebriate
parrots
or
something
gave
me
a
message
for
you
this
i
wait
said
i
on
lady
kynnersley
with
i
went
out
and
walked
down
the
restful
covered
way
of
the
albany
to
the
piccadilly
entrance
and
began
my
taking
of
the
air
it
was
a
soft
november
day
full
of
blue
mist
and
invested
with
a
dying
grace
by
a
pale
sunshine
struggling
through
thin
grey
it
was
a
faded
lady
of
a
day
a
lady
of
waxen
cheeks
attired
in
and
old
lace
her
dim
eyes
illumined
by
a
last
smile
it
gave
an
air
of
unreality
to
the
perspective
of
tall
buildings
and
treated
with
indulgent
irony
the
passing
show
of
humans
on
foot
on
omnibuses
in
cabs
and
motors
turning
them
into
shadow
shapes
tending
no
whither
i
laughed
to
myself
they
all
fancied
themselves
so
real
they
all
had
schemes
in
their
heads
as
if
they
were
going
to
live
a
thousand
years
i
walked
westwards
past
the
great
clubs
moralising
as
i
went
and
feeling
the
reaction
from
the
excitement
of
i
looked
up
at
one
of
my
own
clubs
a
comfortable
and
it
struck
me
as
possessing
more
attractions
than
the
family
vault
in
highgate
cemetery
an
acquaintance
at
the
window
waved
his
hand
at
me
i
thought
him
a
lucky
beggar
to
have
that
window
to
stand
by
when
the
street
will
be
flooded
with
summer
sunshine
and
the
trees
in
the
green
park
opposite
wave
in
their
verdant
bravery
a
little
further
a
radiant
being
all
chiffons
and
millinery
on
her
way
to
bond
street
for
more
millinery
and
chiffons
smiled
at
me
and
put
forth
a
hand
oh
de
gex
you
the
very
man
i
was
longing
to
see
how
simply
are
some
human
aspirations
satisfied
said
i
farfax
that
her
husband
farfax
glenn
a
member
on
my
side
of
the
house
farfax
and
i
are
making
plans
already
for
the
easter
recess
we
are
going
to
motor
to
athens
and
you
must
come
with
us
you
can
tell
us
all
about
everything
as
we
pass
i
looked
grave
easter
is
late
next
what
does
that
matter
say
you
alas
my
dear
glenn
i
said
with
a
smile
i
have
an
engagement
at
easter
a
very
important
i
thought
the
wedding
was
not
to
take
place
till
it
is
the
wedding
said
i
then
break
the
it
beyond
human
power
said
i
she
held
up
her
bracelet
from
which
dangled
some
charms
i
think
you
a
and
she
pointed
to
a
little
golden
pig
i
not
i
retorted
what
are
you
then
i
a
gentleman
in
a
greek
we
laughed
and
parted
and
i
went
on
my
way
cheered
by
the
encounter
i
had
spoken
the
exact
truth
and
found
amusement
in
doing
so
one
has
often
extracted
humour
from
the
contemplation
of
the
dissolution
of
others
that
of
the
giant
in
jack
the
for
instance
and
the
demise
of
the
little
boy
with
the
pair
of
skates
in
the
poem
why
not
extract
it
from
the
contemplation
of
one
own
the
only
disadvantage
of
my
position
is
that
it
give
me
in
spite
of
myself
an
odd
sense
of
isolation
from
my
kind
they
are
looking
forward
to
easters
and
junes
and
summers
and
i
am
not
i
also
have
a
fatuous
feeling
of
superiority
in
being
in
closer
touch
than
they
with
eternal
verities
i
must
take
care
that
i
do
not
play
too
much
to
the
gallery
that
i
do
not
grow
too
conceited
over
the
singularity
of
my
situation
and
arrive
at
the
mental
attitude
of
the
criminal
whose
dominant
solicitude
in
connection
with
his
execution
was
that
he
should
be
hanged
in
his
dress
clothes
these
reflections
brought
me
to
eccleston
square
lady
kynnersley
is
that
type
of
british
matron
who
has
children
in
fits
of
and
to
whom
their
existence
is
a
perpetual
shock
her
main
idea
in
marrying
the
late
sir
thomas
kynnersley
was
to
associate
herself
with
his
political
and
philanthropic

she
is
the
born
committee
woman
to
whom
a
home
represents
a
place
where
one
sleeps
and
eats
in
order
to
maintain
the
strength
required
for
the
performance
of
committee
duties
her
children
have
always
been
outside
the
sphere
of
her
real
interests
but
afflicted
as
such
women
are
with
chronic
inflammation
of
the
conscience
she
had
devoted
the
most
scrupulous
care
to
their
upbringing
she
formed
herself
into
a
society
for
the
protection
of
her
own
children
and
managed
them
by
means
of
a
committee
which
consisted
of
herself
and
of
which
she
was
the
honorary
secretary
she
drew
up
articles
of
association
and
regulations
if
dale
contracted
measles
she
applied
if
janet
slapped
dorothy
was
brought
into
play
when
dale
clamoured
for
a
she
found
that
the
articles
of
association
did
not
provide
for
imaginative
equitation
as
the
children
grew
up
the
committee
had
from
time
to
time
to
revise
the
articles
and
submit
them
to
the
general
body
for
approval
there
were
many
meetings
before
the
new
sections
relating
to
a
university
career
for
the
boy
and
the
coming
out
for
the
girls
were
satisfactorily
drafted
once
given
the
effect
of
law
however
there
was
no
appeal
against
these
provisions
both
committee
and
general
body
were
powerless
dale
certainly
owed
his
methodical
habits
to
his
mechanical
training
but
whence
he
derived
and
how
he
maintained
his
exuberance
and
spontaneity
has
often
puzzled
me
he
himself
accounts
for
it
on
the
score
of
heredity
in
that
an
ancestress
of
his
married
a
highwayman
who
was
hanged
at
tyburn
under
william
and
mary
in
person
lady
kynnersley
is
lean
and
blanched
and
she
wears
gold
spectacles
which
stand
out
oddly
against
the
thin
whiteness
of
her
face
she
is
still
a
handsome
distinguished
woman
who
can
have
when
she
chooses
a
most
gracious
manner
as
i
worldling
and
jester
though
i
am
for
some
mysterious
reason
have
found
favour
in
the
eyes
she
manifests
this
graciousness
whenever
we
foregather
ergo
i
like
lady
kynnersley
and
would
put
myself
to
much
inconvenience
in
order
to
do
her
a
service
she
kept
me
waiting
in
the
but
a
minute
before
she
made
her
appearance
grasped
my
hand
proclaimed
my
goodness
in
responding
so
soon
to
her
call
bade
me
sit
down
on
the
sofa
by
her
side
inquired
after
my
health
and
the
gods
of
politeness
being
propitiated
plunged
at
once
into
the
midst
of
matters
dale
was
going
downhill
headlong
to
gadarene
catastrophe
he
had
no
eyes
or
ears
or
thoughts
for
any
one
in
the
world
but
for
a
certain
lola
brandt
a
brazen
creature
from
a
circus
the
shape
of
whose
limbs
was
the
common
knowledge
of
mankind
from
dublin
to
yokohama
and
whose
path
by
sea
and
land
from
yokohama
to
dublin
was
strewn
with
the
bodies
of
her
victims
with
this
tigress
declared
lady
kynnersley
was
dale
infatuated
he
scorched
himself
morning
noon
and
night
in
her
devastating
presence
had
cut
himself
adrift
from
home
from
society
had
left
trailing
about
on
his
study
table
a
jeweller
bill
for
a
diamond
bracelet
was
committing
follies
that
made
my
brain
reel
to
hear
had
threatened
if
worried
much
longer
to
marry
the
scarlet
one
incontinently
heaven
knew
cried
lady
kynnersley
how
many
husbands
she
had
already
scattered
along
the
track
between
dublin
and
yokohama
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
dale
was
hurtling
down
to
everlasting
bonfire
she
looked
to
me
to
hold
out
the
restraining
hand
you
have
already
spoken
to
dale
on
the
subject
i
asked
mindful
of
the
inharmonious
socks
and
tie
i
can
talk
to
him
of
nothing
else
said
lady
kynnersley
desperately
that
a
pity
said
i
you
should
talk
to
him
of
heaven
or
pigs
or
babylonic
cuneiform
anything
but
lola
brandt
you
ought
to
go
to
work
on
a
different
but
i
have
a
system
at
all
cried
the
poor
lady
how
was
i
to
foresee
that
my
only
son
was
going
to
fall
in
love
with
a
circus
rider
these
are
contingencies
in
life
for
which
one
with
all
the
thought
in
the
world
can
make
no
provision
i
had
arranged
as
you
know
that
he
should
marry
maisie
ellerton
as
charming
a
girl
as
ever
there
was
is
she
and
an
independent
fortune
a
rosebud
wrapped
in
a
gold
leaf
i
murmured
now
he
breaking
the
child
heart
there
was
never
any
engagement
between
them
i
am
sure
of
that
i
remarked
there
was
but
i
gave
her
to
understand
it
was
a
settled
affair
merely
a
question
of
dale
speaking
and
instead
of
speaking
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
and
spends
all
his
time
and
i
suppose
though
i
do
like
to
refer
to
it
all
his
money
in
the
society
of
this
unmentionable
is
she
really
so
so
red
as
she
is
painted
i
asked
she
is
painted
at
all
that
where
her
artful
and
deceitful
devilry
comes
in
i
suppose
dale
said
i
declares
her
to
be
an
angel
of
light
and
purity
an
angel
on
horseback
whoever
heard
of
such
a
thing
it
the
name
of
a
rather
fiery
savoury
said
i
in
a
circus
she
continued
well
said
i
the
ring
of
a
circus
is
not
essentially
one
of
the
circles
in
dante
of
course
my
dear
simon
she
said
with
some
impatience
if
you
defend
him
i
hastened
to
interrupt
her
i
do
i
think
he
is
an
egregious
young
idiot
but
before
taking
action
it
well
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
facts
by
the
way
how
do
you
know
she
not
painted
i
seen
her
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
in
dale
company
at
the
savoy
he
there
supping
with
her
every
night
general
lamont
told
me
i
would
believe
it
dale
flaunting
about
in
public
with
her
the
general
offered
to
take
me
there
after
the
inaugural
meeting
of
the
international
aid
society
at
grosvenor
house
i
went
and
saw
them
together
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
in
the
boy
eyes
till
my
dying
day
she
has
got
him
body
and
soul
one
reads
of
such
things
in
the
poets
one
sees
it
in
pictures
but
i
never
come
across
it
in
real
life
never
never
it
dreadful
horrible
revolting
to
think
that
a
son
of
mine
brought
up
from
babyhood
to
calculate
all
his
actions
with
mathematical
precision
should
be
guilty
of
this
profligacy
driving
me
mad
simon
it
really
is
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
come
to
the
end
of
my
resources
it
your
turn
now
the
boy
worships
a
wild
appeal
burned
in
her
eyes
and
was
refracted
oddly
through
her
spectacles
i
had
never
seen
her
betray
emotion
before
during
all
the
years
of
our
friendship
the
look
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
moved
me
i
expressed
my
sympathy
and
my
readiness
to
do
anything
in
my
power
to
snatch
the
infatuated
boy
from
the
claw
and
fang
of
the
syren
and
hale
him
to
the
forgiving
feet
of
maisie
ellerton
indeed
such
a
chivalrous
adventure
had
vaguely
passed
through
my
mind
during
my
exalted
mood
at
but
then
i
knew
little
beyond
the
fact
that
dale
was
fluttering
round
an
undesirable
candle
till
now
i
had
no
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
his
wings
were
singed
has
dale
spoken
to
you
about
this
creature
his
mother
asked
young
men
of
good
taste
keep
these
things
from
their
elders
my
dear
lady
kynnersley
said
i
but
you
knew
of
it
in
a
dim
sort
of
oh
simon
the
baby
boys
of
dale
set
regard
taking
out
the
chorus
to
supper
as
a
solemn
religious
rite
they
would
think
themselves
respectable
if
they
did
i
done
it
myself
in
moderation
when
i
was
very
men
are
mysteries
sighed
lady
kynnersley
please
regard
them
as
such
said
i
with
a
laugh
and
let
dale
alone
allow
him
to
do
whatever
irrational
thing
he
likes
save
bringing
the
lady
here
to
tea
if
you
try
to
tear
him
away
from
her
he
only
cling
to
her
the
closer
if
you
trumpet
abroad
her
infamy
he
proclaim
her
a
slandered
and
martyred
saint
leave
him
to
me
for
the
i
do
so
gladly
said
lady
kynnersley
with
surprising
meekness
but
you
bring
him
back
simon
i
arranged
for
him
to
marry
maisie
i
ca
have
my
plans
for
the
future
dear
excellent
but
woman
i
have
your
promise
have
i
she
said
her
hand
in
mine
you
have
said
i
nobly
but
how
in
the
name
of
astaroth
i
going
to
keep
it
i
have
the
remotest
conception
chapter
iii
some
letters
in
dale
round
handwriting
lay
on
the
library
table
awaiting
my
signature
dale
himself
had
gone
a
lady
had
called
for
him
said
rogers
in
an
electric
brougham
as
my
chambers
are
on
the
second
floor
and
the
staircase
down
the
arcade
rogers
detailed
information
surprised
me
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
a
chauffeur
in
livery
sir
came
to
the
door
and
said
that
the
brougham
was
waiting
for
i
do
see
how
the
lady
came
in
i
remarked
she
did
sir
she
remained
in
the
brougham
said
rogers
so
lola
brandt
keeps
an
electric
brougham
i
lunched
at
the
club
and
turned
up
the
article
lola
brandt
in
the
living
encyclopaedia
that
was
my
friend
renniker
the
wonderful
man
gave
me
her
history
from
the
cradle
to
cadogan
gardens
where
she
now
resides
i
must
say
that
his
details
were
rather
vague
she
rode
in
a
circus
or
had
a
talking
horse
he
was
not
quite
sure
and
concerning
her
conjugal
or
heart
affairs
he
admitted
that
his
information
was
either
unauthenticated
or
conjectural
at
any
rate
she
had
not
a
shred
of
reputation
and
she
did
want
it
said
renniker
it
would
be
as
much
use
to
her
as
a
diving
suit
she
has
young
dale
kynnersley
in
tow
he
remarked
so
i
gather
said
i
and
now
can
you
tell
me
something
else
what
is
the
present
state
of
political
parties
in
guatemala
i
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
guatemala
but
i
did
not
care
to
discuss
dale
with
renniker
when
he
had
completed
his
sketch
of
affairs
in
that
obscure
republic
i
thanked
him
politely
and
ordered
coffee
feeling
in
a
gregarious
companionable
humour
i
have
had
enough
solitude
at
murglebed
to
last
me
the
rest
of
my
short
lifetime
i
went
later
in
the
afternoon
to
sussex
gardens
to
call
on
ellerton
it
was
her
day
at
home
and
the
was
filled
with
chattering
people
i
stayed
until
most
of
them
were
gone
and
then
maisie
dragged
me
to
the
inner
room
where
a
table
was
strewn
with
the
wreckage
of
tea
i
have
had
any
she
said
grasping
the
teapot
and
pouring
a
treacly
liquid
into
a
cup
you
must
have
some
more
do
you
like
it
black
or
with
milk
she
is
a
dainty
slip
of
a
girl
with
deep
grey
eyes
and
wavy
brown
hair
and
a
complexion
i
absently
swallowed
the
abomination
she
handed
me
for
i
was
looking
at
her
over
the
teacup
and
wondering
how
an
gentleman
like
dale
could
forsake
her
for
a
lola
brandt
it
was
not
as
if
maisie
were
an
little
girl
she
is
a
young
person
of
sense
education
and
character
she
also
adores
musical
comedy
and
a
band
at
dinner
an
excellent
thing
in
woman
when
she
is
very
young
why
are
you
looking
at
me
like
that
she
asked
because
my
dear
maisie
said
i
you
are
good
to
look
upon
you
are
also
dropping
a
she
hastily
secured
the
dangling
thing
i
did
my
hair
anyhow
she
explained
again
i
thought
of
dale
tie
and
socks
the
signs
of
a
careless
desolation
described
by
rosalind
so
minutely
can
still
be
detected
in
modern
youth
of
both
sexes
i
did
not
pursue
the
question
but
alluded
to
autumn
gaieties
she
spoke
of
them
without
enthusiasm
miss
somebody
wedding
was
very
dull
and
somebody
else
dance
manned
with
vile
and
vacuous
dancers
at
the
opera
the
greatest
of
german
sopranos
sang
false
all
human
institutions
had
taken
a
crooked
turn
and
her
cat
could
not
be
persuaded
to
pay
the
commonest
attention
to
its
kittens
then
she
asked
me
nonchalantly
have
you
seen
anything
of
dale
lately
he
was
working
with
me
this
morning
i
been
away
you
i
when
did
you
last
see
him
i
asked
oh
ages
ago
he
has
not
been
near
us
for
weeks
we
used
to
be
such
friends
i
do
think
it
very
polite
of
him
do
you
i
order
him
to
call
forthwith
said
i
oh
please
do
if
he
wo
come
of
his
own
accord
i
do
want
to
see
him
she
tossed
her
shapely
head
and
looked
at
me
bravely
you
are
quite
right
said
i
dale
a
selfish
young
he
is
she
flashed
how
dare
you
say
such
things
about
him
i
smiled
and
took
both
her
hands
one
of
them
held
a
piece
of
brown
my
dear
said
i
model
yourself
on
little
i
do
know
who
gave
her
the
famous
bit
of
advice
but
i
think
it
was
i
myself
in
a
pastoral
incarnation
i
had
a
woolly
cloak
and
a
crook
and
she
was
like
a
dresden
china
figure
the
image
of
her
eyes
swam
but
she
laughed
and
said
i
was
good
to
her
i
said
the
man
who
would
be
good
to
you
is
an
unhung
then
her
mother
joined
us
and
our
little
confidential
talk
came
to
an
end
it
was
enough
however
to
convince
me
that
my
poor
little
ariadne
was
shedding
many
desperate
tears
in
secret
over
her
desertion
on
my
way
home
i
looked
in
on
my
doctor
his
name
is
hunnington
he
grasped
me
by
the
hand
and
eagerly
inquired
whether
my
pain
was
worse
i
said
it
was
not
he
professed
delight
but
looked
disappointed
i
ought
to
have
replied
in
the
affirmative
it
is
so
easy
to
make
others
happy
i
dined
read
a
novel
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
cheerful
frame
of
mind
induced
by
the
consciousness
of
having
made
some
little
progress
on
the
path
of
eumoiriety
the
next
morning
dale
made
his
customary
appearance
he
wore
a
morning
coat
a
dark
tie
and
boots
well
said
i
have
you
dressed
more
carefully
today
he
looked
himself
anxiously
over
and
inquired
whether
there
was
anything
wrong
i
assured
him
of
the
impeccability
of
his
attire
and
commented
on
its
splendour
are
you
going
to
take
maisie
out
to
lunch
he
started
and
reddened
beneath
his
dark
skin
before
he
could
speak
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
an
old
friend
dale
you
must
be
angry
with
me
but
do
you
think
you
treating
maisie
rather
badly
you
no
right
to
say
so
he
burst
out
hotly
no
one
has
the
right
to
say
so
there
was
never
a
question
of
an
engagement
between
maisie
and
then
there
ought
to
have
been
i
said
judicially
no
decent
man
plays
fast
and
loose
with
a
girl
and
throws
her
over
just
at
the
moment
when
he
ought
to
be
asking
her
to
marry
i
suppose
my
mother
been
at
you
that
what
she
wanted
to
see
you
about
yesterday
i
wish
to
god
she
would
mind
her
own
and
that
i
would
mind
mine
dale
did
not
reply
for
some
odd
reason
he
is
devotedly
attached
to
me
and
respects
my
opinion
on
worldly
matters
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
presently
without
turning
round
he
said
i
suppose
she
has
been
rubbing
it
in
about
lola
brandt
she
did
mention
the
lady
name
said
i
so
did
renniker
at
the
club
i
suppose
every
one
you
know
and
many
you
do
are
mentioning
well
what
if
they
are
they
creating
an
atmosphere
about
your
name
which
is
scarcely
that
in
which
to
make
an
entrance
into
public
still
with
his
back
turned
he
morosely
informed
me
in
his
vernacular
that
he
contemplated
public
life
with
feelings
of
indifference
and
was
perfectly
prepared
to
abandon
his
ambitions
i
took
up
my
parable
the
same
old
parable
that
wise
seniors
have
preached
to
the
deluded
young
from
time
immemorial
i
have
seldom
held
forth
so
platitudinously
even
in
the
house
of
commons
i
spoke
as
impressively
as
a
bishop
in
the
midst
of
my
harangue
he
came
and
sat
by
the
library
table
and
rested
his
chin
on
his
palm
looking
at
me
quietly
out
of
his
dark
eyes
his
mildness
encouraged
me
to
further
efforts
i
instanced
cases
of
other
young
men
of
the
world
who
had
gone
the
way
of
the
flesh
and
had
ended
at
the
devil
there
was
paget
of
the
guards
eaten
to
the
bone
by
the
syren
not
even
the
gold
lace
on
his
uniform
left
there
was
merridew
once
the
hope
of
the
party
now
living
in
ignoble
obscurity
with
an
old
and
painted
mistress
whom
he
detested
but
to
whom
habit
and
sapped
kept
him
in
thrall
there
was
bullen
who
blew
his
brains
out
in
a
generous
glow
i
waxed
prophetic
and
drew
a
vivid
picture
of
dale
moral
mental
physical
financial
and
social
ruin
and
finished
up
in
a
masterly
peroration
then
without
moving
he
calmly
said
my
dear
simon
you
are
talking
through
your
hat
he
had
allowed
me
to
walk
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
hearthrug
before
a
blazing
fire
pouring
out
the
wealth
of
my
wisdom
experience
and
rhetoric
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
and
then
coolly
informed
me
that
i
was
talking
through
my
hat
i
wiped
my
forehead
sat
down
and
looked
at
him
across
the
table
in
surprise
and
indignation
if
you
can
point
out
one
irrelevant
or
absurd
remark
in
my
homily
eat
the
hat
through
which
you
say
i
the
whole
thing
is
rot
from
beginning
to
end
said
he
none
of
you
good
people
know
anything
at
all
about
lola
brandt
she
not
the
sort
of
woman
you
think
she
quite
different
you
ca
judge
her
by
ordinary
standards
there
not
a
woman
like
her
in
the
wide
world
i
made
a
gesture
of
discouragement
the
same
old
parable
of
the
wise
had
evoked
the
same
old
retort
from
the
deluded
young
she
was
quite
different
from
other
women
she
was
misunderstood
by
the
cynical
and
world
a
heart
of
virgin
purity
beat
beneath
her
mercenary
bosom
her
lurid
past
had
been
the
reiterated
martyrdom
of
a
noble
nature
o
golden
age
o
unutterable
silliness
of
boyhood
for
heaven
sake
do
talk
in
that
way
he
cried
i
had
been
talking
in
that
way
and
he
rose
and
walked
like
a
young
tiger
about
the
room
i
ca
stand
it
i
gone
mad
about
her
she
has
got
into
my
blood
somehow
i
think
about
her
all
day
long
and
i
ca
sleep
at
night
i
would
give
up
any
mortal
thing
on
earth
for
her
she
is
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
she
the
dearest
sweetest
tenderest
most
beautiful
creature
god
ever
made
and
you
honour
and
respect
her
just
as
you
would
honour
and
respect
maisie
i
asked
quietly
of
course
i
do
he
flashed
do
i
tell
you
that
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
her
she
is
the
dearest
sweetest
etc
and
he
continued
to
trumpet
forth
the
olympian
qualities
of
the
syren
and
his
own
fervent
adoration
i
was
the
only
being
to
whom
he
had
opened
his
heart
and
the
floodgates
being
set
free
the
torrent
burst
forth
in
this
tempestuous
and
incoherent
manner
i
let
him
go
on
for
i
thought
it
did
him
good
but
his
rhapsody
added
very
little
to
my
information
the
lady
who
had
her
way
from
dublin
to
yokohama
was
the
spotless
queen
of
beauty
and
dale
was
frenziedly
idiotically
in
love
with
her
that
was
all
i
could
gather
when
he
had
finished
which
he
did
somewhat
abruptly
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
took
out
his
with
shaky
fingers
there
i
suppose
i
made
a
exhibition
of
myself
he
said
defiantly
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
it
precisely
i
replied
what
i
said
before
i
repeat
it
if
you
indeed
what
more
was
there
to
say
for
the
present
about
the
lunatic
business
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
arguments
he
reflected
for
a
moment
then
rose
and
came
over
to
the
fireplace
look
here
simon
you
must
let
me
go
my
own
way
in
this
in
matters
of
politics
and
worldly
wisdom
and
social
affairs
and
honourable
dealing
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
would
follow
you
blindly
you
my
chief
and
a
kind
of
elder
brother
as
well
i
would
do
any
mortal
thing
for
you
you
know
that
but
you
no
right
to
try
to
guide
me
in
this
matter
you
know
no
more
about
it
than
my
mother
you
had
no
experience
you
never
let
yourself
go
about
a
woman
in
your
life
lord
of
heaven
man
you
have
never
begun
to
know
what
it
means
oh
dear
me
here
was
the
situation
as
old
as
the
return
of
the
prodigal
or
the
desertion
of
the
trusting
village
maiden
or
any
other
cliche
in
the
melodrama
of
real
life
you
are
making
a
fool
of
yourself
says
mentor
ah
shrieks
telemachus
but
you
never
loved
you
do
know
what
love
i
looked
at
him
whimsically
do
i
my
thoughts
sped
back
down
the
years
to
a
garden
in
france
her
name
was
clothilde
we
met
in
a
manner
outrageous
to
gallic
propriety
as
i
used
to
climb
over
the
garden
wall
to
the
peril
of
my
epidermis
we
loved
we
were
parted
by
stern
parents
not
mine
and
clothilde
was
packed
off
to
the
good
sisters
who
had
previously
had
care
of
her
education
now
she
is
fat
and
happy
and
the
wife
of
a
banker
and
the
mother
of
children
but
the
romance
was
sad
and
bad
and
mad
enough
while
it
lasted
and
when
clothilde
was
figuratively
dragged
from
my
arms
i
cursed
and
swore
and
herod
played
termagant
and
summoned
the
heavens
to
fall
down
and
crush
me
miserable
beneath
their
weight
and
then
her
brother
challenged
me
to
fight
a
duel
whereupon
as
the
most
worshipped
of
all
she
had
not
received
a
of
harm
at
my
hands
i
called
him
a
silly
ass
and
threatened
to
break
his
head
if
he
interfered
any
more
in
my
legitimate
despair
i
smile
at
it
now
but
it
was
real
at
as
real
i
take
it
as
dale
consuming
passion
for
the
lady
of
the
circus
there
was
also
i
remembered
a
certain
but
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
dale
neither
had
the
tragedy
of
my
lost
clothilde
the
memories
however
brought
a
wistful
touch
of
sympathy
into
my
voice
you
soberly
think
my
dear
old
dale
said
i
that
i
know
nothing
of
love
and
passion
and
the
rest
of
the
divine
madness
i
sure
you
do
he
cried
with
an
impatient
gesture
if
you
did
you
would
he
came
to
an
abrupt
and
confused
halt
i
would
what
nothing
i
forgot
what
i
was
going
to
say
let
us
talk
of
something
it
was
on
the
tip
of
your
impulsive
tongue
said
i
cheerfully
to
refer
to
my
attitude
towards
miss
i
desperately
sorry
said
he
reddening
it
was
unpardonable
but
how
did
you
guess
i
laughed
and
quoted
the
latin
tag
about
the
ingenuous
boy
of
the
ingenuous
visage
and
ingenuous
modesty
because
i
do
feverishly
search
the
postbag
for
a
letter
from
miss
faversham
you
conclude
i
a
bloodless
automaton
please
do
say
any
more
about
it
simon
he
pleaded
in
deep
distress
a
sudden
idea
struck
me
i
reflected
walked
to
the
window
and
having
made
up
my
mind
sat
down
again
i
had
a
weapon
to
hand
which
i
had
overlooked
and
with
the
discovery
came
a
weak
craving
for
the
sympathy
i
believe
i
care
more
for
him
than
for
any
living
creature
i
decided
to
give
him
some
notion
of
my
position
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
learn
it
i
would
rather
like
to
tell
you
something
said
i
about
my
engagement
in
confidence
of
course
when
eleanor
faversham
comes
back
i
propose
to
ask
her
to
release
me
from
he
drew
a
long
breath
i
glad
she
an
awfully
nice
girl
but
she
no
more
in
love
with
you
than
my
mother
is
but
it
be
rather
difficult
wo
it
i
do
think
so
i
replied
shaking
my
head
it
a
question
of
health
my
doctors
absolutely
forbid
a
look
of
affectionate
alarm
sprang
into
his
eyes
he
broke
into
sympathy
my
health
why
had
i
not
told
him
before
in
heaven
name
what
was
the
matter
with
me
something
silly
said
i
nothing
you
need
worry
about
on
my
account
only
i
must
go
for
the
rest
of
my
days
marriage
is
to
be
thought
of
there
is
something
else
i
must
tell
you
i
must
resign
my
resign
your
seat
give
up
parliament
when
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
me
aghast
as
if
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
we
had
better
concoct
an
epistle
to
raggles
this
but
you
ca
be
serious
i
can
sometimes
my
dear
dale
this
is
one
of
the
afflicting
you
out
of
parliament
you
out
of
public
life
it
inconceivable
damnable
but
you
just
coming
into
your
own
what
raggles
said
what
i
told
you
yesterday
but
it
ca
be
you
can
hold
on
i
do
all
the
drudgery
for
you
i
work
night
and
and
he
tramped
up
and
down
the
room
uttering
the
disconnected
phrases
which
an
honest
young
soul
unaccustomed
to
express
itself
emotionally
blurts
out
in
moments
of
deep
feeling
it
no
use
dale
said
i
i
got
my
marching
but
why
should
they
come
just
now
when
the
sweets
of
office
are
dangling
at
my
lips
it
pretty
i
laughed
it
one
of
the
little
ironies
that
please
the
high
gods
so
immensely
they
have
an
elementary
sense
of
humour
like
that
of
the
funny
fellow
who
pulls
your
chair
from
under
you
and
shrieks
with
laughter
when
you
go
wallop
on
to
the
floor
well
i
do
grudge
them
their
amusement
they
must
have
a
dull
time
settling
mundane
affairs
and
a
little
joke
goes
a
long
way
with
them
as
it
does
in
the
house
of
commons
fancy
sitting
on
those
green
benches
legislating
for
all
eternity
with
never
a
recess
and
never
even
a
dinner
hour
poor
high
gods
let
us
pity
i
looked
at
him
and
smiled
perhaps
a
little
wearily
one
can
always
command
one
eyes
but
one
lips
sometimes
get
out
of
control
he
could
not
have
noticed
my
lips
however
for
he
cried
by
george
you
splendid
i
wish
i
could
take
a
blow
like
that
you
have
to
one
of
these
days
it
the
only
way
of
taking
it
and
now
said
i
in
a
businesslike
tone
i
told
you
all
this
with
a
purpose
at
wymington
it
will
be
a
case
of
roi
est
mort
vive
le
roi
the
vacancy
will
have
to
be
filled
up
at
once
we
have
to
find
a
suitable
candidate
have
you
one
in
your
mind
not
a
i
who
me
he
nearly
sprang
into
the
air
with
astonishment
why
not
they
never
adopt
i
think
they
would
i
said
there
are
men
in
the
house
as
young
as
you
you
well
known
at
wymington
and
at
headquarters
as
my
man
you
done
some
speaking
you
do
it
rather
well
it
only
your
private
conversational
style
that
atrocious
you
got
a
name
familiar
in
public
life
up
and
down
the
country
thanks
to
your
father
and
mother
it
a
fairly
safe
seat
i
see
no
reason
why
they
adopt
you
would
you
like
it
like
it
he
cried
why
i
give
my
ears
for
then
said
i
playing
my
winning
card
let
us
hear
no
more
about
lola
he
gave
me
a
swift
glance
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
while
in
silence
presently
he
halted
in
front
of
me
look
here
simon
you
a
beast
but
he
smiled
frankly
at
the
quotation
you
a
just
beast
you
ought
to
rub
it
in
like
that
about
lola
until
you
have
seen
her
yourself
it
is
you
speak
now
in
language
distinctly
approaching
that
of
reason
i
remarked
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
come
with
me
this
afternoon
and
see
my
young
friend
had
me
nicely
in
the
trap
i
could
not
refuse
very
well
said
i
but
on
the
distinct
understanding
oh
on
any
old
understanding
you
like
he
cried
and
darted
to
the
door
where
are
you
going
to
ring
her
up
on
the
telephone
and
tell
her
you
that
the
worst
of
the
young
they
have
such
a
disconcerting
manner
of
clinching
one
undertakings
chapter
iv
my
first
impression
of
lola
brandt
in
the
dimness
of
the
room
was
that
of
a
lithe
panther
in
petticoats
rising
lazily
from
the
depths
of
an
easy
chair
a
sinuous
action
of
the
arm
as
she
extended
her
hand
to
welcome
me
was
accompanied
by
a
curiously
flexible
turn
of
the
body
her
hand
as
it
enveloped
rather
than
grasped
mine
seemed
boneless
but
exceedingly
powerful
an
indoor
dress
of
brown
and
gold
striped
indian
silk
clung
to
her
figure
which
largely
built
had
an
appearance
of
great
strength
dark
bronze
hair
and
dark
eyes
that
in
the
soft
light
of
the
room
glowed
with
deep
gold
reflections
completed
the
pantherine
suggestion
she
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
thirty
a
most
dangerous
woman
i
decided
one
to
be
shut
up
in
a
cage
with
thick
iron
bars
it
charming
of
you
to
come
i
heard
so
much
of
you
from
kynnersley
do
sit
her
voice
was
lazy
and
languorous
and
caressing
like
the
purr
of
a
great
cat
and
there
was
something
exotic
in
her
accent
something
seductive
something
that
ought
to
be
prohibited
by
the
police
she
sank
into
her
low
chair
by
the
fire
indicating
one
for
me
square
with
the
hearthrug
dale
so
as
to
leave
me
a
fair
conversational
field
with
the
lady
established
himself
on
the
sofa
some
distance
off
and
began
to
talk
with
a
chow
dog
with
whom
he
was
obviously
on
terms
of
familiarity
madame
brandt
make
a
remark
about
the
chow
dog
virtues
to
which
i
politely
replied
she
put
him
through
several
tricks
i
admired
his
talent
she
declared
her
affections
to
be
divided
between
adolphus
that
was
the
chow
dog
name
and
an
ouistiti
who
was
confined
to
bed
for
the
present
owing
to
the
evil
qualities
of
the
november
air
for
the
first
time
i
blessed
the
english
climate
i
hate
little
monkeys
i
also
felt
a
queer
disappointment
a
woman
like
that
ought
to
have
caught
an
she
guessed
my
thought
in
an
uncanny
manner
and
smiled
showing
strong
white
even
teeth
the
most
marvellous
teeth
i
have
ever
beheld
so
even
as
to
constitute
almost
a
deformity
i
fonder
of
bigger
animals
she
said
i
was
born
among
them
my
father
was
a
lion
tamer
so
i
know
all
the
ways
of
beasts
i
love
bears
i
once
trained
one
to
drive
a
cart
but
with
a
sigh
you
keep
bears
in
cadogan
you
may
get
hold
of
a
human
one
now
and
then
said
dale
i
no
doubt
madame
brandt
could
train
him
to
dance
to
whatever
tune
she
played
said
i
she
turned
her
dark
golden
eyes
lazily
slumberously
on
me
why
do
you
say
that
de
gex
this
was
disconcerting
why
had
i
said
it
for
no
particular
reason
save
to
keep
up
a
commonplace
conversation
in
which
i
took
no
absorbing
interest
it
was
a
direct
challenge
young
dale
stopped
playing
with
the
chow
dog
and
grinned
it
behooved
me
to
say
something
i
said
it
with
a
bow
and
a
wave
of
my
hand
because
though
your
father
was
a
your
mother
was
a
she
appeared
to
reflect
for
a
moment
then
addressing
dale
the
answer
does
amount
to
a
of
but
you
have
got
out
of
it
like
i
was
again
disconcerted
but
i
remarked
that
he
would
learn
in
time
when
my
mentorship
was
over
and
i
handed
him
a
finished
product
to
society
how
long
will
that
be
she
asked
i
do
know
are
you
anxious
for
his
immediate
perfecting
her
shoulders
gave
what
in
ordinary
women
would
have
been
a
shrug
with
her
it
was
a
slow
ripple
i
vow
if
her
neck
had
been
bare
one
could
have
seen
it
undulate
beneath
the
skin
what
is
perfection
can
you
ask
laughed
dale
behold
and
he
pointed
to
me
that
cheap
said
the
lady
i
heard
auguste
say
cleverer
who
auguste
asked
dale
auguste
said
i
is
the
generic
name
of
the
clown
in
the
french
oh
the
circus
cried
dale
i
be
glad
if
you
teach
him
to
call
it
the
hippodrome
de
gex
she
remarked
with
another
of
her
slumberous
glances
that
will
be
one
step
nearer
perfection
said
i
the
short
november
twilight
had
deepened
into
darkness
the
fire
which
was
blazing
when
we
entered
had
settled
into
a
glow
and
the
room
was
lit
by
one
shaded
lamp
to
me
the
dimness
was
restful
but
dale
who
with
the
crude
instincts
of
youth
loves
glare
began
to
fidget
and
presently
asked
whether
he
might
turn
on
the
electric
light
permission
was
given
my
hostess
invited
me
to
smoke
and
to
hand
her
a
box
of
cigarettes
which
lay
on
the
mantelpiece
i
rose
bent
over
her
while
she
lit
her
cigarette
from
my
match
and
resuming
an
upright
position
became
rooted
to
the
hearthrug
with
the
flood
of
illumination
disclosing
everything
that
hitherto
had
been
wrapped
in
shadow
and
mystery
came
a
shock
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
perplexing
room
the
cheap
and
the
costly
the
rare
and
the
common
the
exquisite
and
the
tawdry
jostled
one
another
on
walls
and
floor
at
one
end
of
the
louis
xvi
sofa
on
which
dale
had
been
sitting
lay
a
boating
cushion
covered
with
a
union
jack
at
the
other
a
cushion
covered
with
old
moorish
embroidery
the
chair
i
had
vacated
i
discovered
to
be
of
old
spanish
oak
and
stamped
cordova
leather
bearing
traces
of
a
in
gold
my
hostess
lounged
in
a
low
characterless
seat
amid
a
mass
of
heterogeneous
cushions
there
were
many
flowers
in
the
room
some
in
cloisonne
vases
others
in
gimcrack
vessels
such
as
are
bought
at
country
fairs
on
the
mantelpiece
and
on
tables
were
mingled
precious
ivories
from
japan
trumpery
chalets
from
the
tyrol
choice
bits
of
sevres
and
venetian
glass
bottles
with
ladders
and
little
men
inside
them
vulgar
china
fowls
sitting
on
eggs
and
a
thousand
restless
little
objects
screeching
in
dumb
agony
at
one
another
the
more
one
looked
the
more
confounded
became
confusion
lengths
of
beautifully
embroidered
chinese
silk
formed
curtains
for
the
doors
and
windows
but
they
were
tied
back
with
cords
ending
in
horrible
little
plush
monkeys
in
lieu
of
tassels
a
second
empire
gilt
mirror
hung
over
the
louis
xvi
sofa
and
was
flanked
on
the
one
side
by
a
villainous
german
print
of
the
huntsman
return
and
on
the
other
by
a
dainty
myriads
of
photographs
some
in
frames
met
the
eye
everywhere
on
the
grand
piano
on
the
occasional
tables
on
the
mantelpiece
stuck
obliquely
all
round
the
queen
anne
mirror
above
it
on
the
walls
many
of
them
represented
animals
bears
and
lions
and
pawing
horses
dale
photograph
i
noticed
in
a
silver
frame
on
the
piano
there
was
not
a
book
in
the
place
but
in
the
corner
of
the
room
by
a
further
window
gleamed
a
large
marble
venus
of
milo
charmingly
executed
who
stood
regarding
the
welter
with
eyes
calm
and
unconcerned
i
was
aroused
from
the
momentary
shock
caused
by
the
revelation
of
this
eccentric
apartment
by
an
unknown
nauseous
flavour
in
my
mouth
i
realised
it
was
the
cigarette
to
which
i
had
helped
myself
from
the
beautifully
chased
silver
casket
i
had
taken
from
the
mantelpiece
i
eyed
the
thing
and
concluded
it
was
made
of
the
very
cheapest
tobacco
and
was
what
the
street
urchin
calls
a
i
learned
afterwards
that
i
was
right
she
purchased
them
at
the
rate
of
six
for
a
penny
and
smoked
them
in
enormous
quantities
for
politeness
sake
i
continued
to
puff
at
the
unclean
thing
until
i
nearly
made
myself
sick
then
simulating
absentmindedness
i
threw
it
into
the
fire
why
in
the
sacred
name
of
nicotine
does
a
luxurious
lady
like
lola
brandt
smoke
such
unutterable
garbage
on
the
other
hand
the
tea
which
she
offered
us
a
few
minutes
later
and
begged
us
to
drink
without
milk
was
the
most
exquisite
i
have
tasted
outside
russia
she
informed
us
that
she
got
it
direct
from
moscow
i
ca
stand
your
black
ceylon
tea
she
remarked
with
a
grimace
and
yet
she
could
smoke
i
wondered
what
other
contradictious
tastes
she
possessed
no
doubt
she
could
eat
blood
puddings
with
relish
and
had
a
discriminating
palate
for
claret
truly
a
perplexing
lady
you
must
find
leisure
in
london
a
great
change
after
your
adventurous
career
said
i
by
way
of
polite
conversation
i
just
love
it
i
as
lazy
as
a
cat
she
said
settling
with
her
pantherine
grace
among
the
cushions
do
you
know
what
has
been
my
ambition
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
whatever
of
woman
ambitions
you
had
you
must
have
attained
said
i
with
a
bow
pooh
she
said
you
mean
that
i
can
have
crowds
of
men
falling
in
love
with
me
that
she
was
certainly
frank
i
meant
something
quite
different
i
wonder
whether
you
can
understand
the
world
used
to
seem
to
me
divided
into
two
classes
that
never
met
we
performing
people
and
the
public
the
thousand
white
faces
that
looked
at
us
and
went
away
and
talked
to
other
white
faces
and
forgot
all
about
performing
animals
till
they
came
next
time
now
i
got
what
i
wanted
see
i
one
of
the
and
you
love
philistia
better
than
bohemia
i
asked
she
knitted
her
brows
and
looked
at
me
puzzled
if
you
want
to
talk
to
me
she
said
you
must
talk
straight
i
had
no
more
education
than
a
tinker
she
made
this
peculiar
announcement
not
defiantly
not
rudely
but
appealingly
graciously
it
was
not
a
rebuke
for
priggishness
it
was
the
unpresentable
statement
of
a
fact
i
apologized
for
a
lunatic
habit
of
speech
and
paraphrased
my
question
in
a
word
cried
dale
coming
in
on
my
heels
with
an
elucidation
of
my
periphrasis
what
de
gex
is
driving
at
is
do
you
prefer
respectability
to
ramping
round
she
turned
slowly
to
him
my
dear
boy
when
do
you
think
i
was
not
respectable
he
jumped
from
the
sofa
as
if
the
chow
dog
had
bitten
him
good
heavens
i
never
meant
you
to
take
it
that
way
she
laughed
stretched
up
a
lazy
arm
to
him
and
looked
at
him
somewhat
quizzically
in
the
face
as
he
kissed
her
although
i
could
have
boxed
the
silly
fellow
ears
i
vow
he
did
it
in
a
very
pretty
fashion
the
young
man
of
the
day
as
a
general
rule
has
no
more
notion
how
to
kiss
a
woman
hand
than
how
to
take
snuff
or
dance
a
pavane
indeed
lots
of
them
do
know
how
to
kiss
a
girl
at
all
my
dear
she
said
i
was
much
more
respectable
sitting
on
the
stage
at
tea
with
my
horse
sultan
than
supping
with
you
at
the
savoy
you
do
know
the
deadly
respectability
of
most
people
in
the
profession
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
while
we
being
utterly
dull
and
dowdy
the
public
think
we
having
a
devil
of
a
time
so
we
do
even
get
the
credit
of
our
virtues
i
prefer
the
savoy
and
she
turned
to
me
it
is
nice
having
decent
people
to
tea
do
you
know
what
i
should
love
i
should
love
to
have
an
at
home
day
and
receive
ladies
real
ladies
and
i
have
such
a
sweet
place
have
i
you
have
many
beautiful
things
around
you
said
i
truthfully
she
sighed
i
should
like
more
people
to
see
in
fact
said
i
you
have
social
ambitions
madame
brandt
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
are
you
skinning
me
she
asked
where
she
had
picked
up
this
eccentric
metaphor
i
know
not
she
had
many
odd
turns
of
language
as
yet
not
current
among
the
fashionable
classes
i
gravely
assured
her
that
i
was
not
sarcastic
i
commended
her
praiseworthy
aspirations
but
said
i
innocently
do
you
miss
the
hard
training
the
physical
exercise
the
delight
of
motion
the
excitement
the
my
vocabulary
failing
me
i
sketched
with
a
gesture
the
classical
encouragement
to
her
steed
she
looked
at
me
uncomprehendingly
the
what
she
asked
what
are
you
playing
at
inquired
dale
i
was
referring
to
the
ring
said
i
they
both
burst
out
laughing
to
my
discomfiture
what
do
you
take
me
for
a
circus
rider
performing
in
a
tent
and
living
in
a
caravan
you
think
i
jump
through
a
hoop
in
tights
all
i
can
say
i
murmured
by
way
of
apology
is
that
it
a
mendacious
world
i
deeply
why
had
i
been
misled
in
this
shameful
manner
madame
brandt
with
lazy
good
nature
accepted
my
excuses
i
what
is
professionally
known
as
a
she
explained
of
course
when
i
was
a
kid
i
was
trained
as
an
acrobat
for
my
father
was
poor
but
when
he
grew
rich
and
the
owner
of
animals
which
he
did
when
i
was
fourteen
i
joined
him
and
worked
with
him
all
over
the
world
until
i
went
on
my
own
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
of
me
madame
brandt
said
i
the
last
thing
to
be
astonished
at
is
human
ignorance
do
you
know
that
per
cent
of
the
french
army
at
the
present
day
have
never
heard
of
the
war
my
dear
simon
cried
dale
the
two
things
do
hang
together
the
war
is
not
advertised
all
over
france
like
pills
whereas
six
years
ago
you
could
move
two
steps
in
london
without
seeing
posters
of
lola
brandt
and
her
horse
ah
the
horse
said
i
that
how
the
wicked
circus
story
got
it
was
the
last
act
i
ever
did
said
madame
brandt
i
taught
sultan
oh
he
was
a
dear
beautiful
thing
to
count
and
add
up
and
guess
articles
taken
from
the
audience
i
was
at
the
hippodrome
then
at
the
nouveau
cirque
at
paris
i
was
at
petersburg
vienna
berlin
all
over
europe
with
and
where
is
sultan
now
i
asked
he
is
dead
somebody
poisoned
him
she
replied
looking
into
the
fire
after
a
pause
she
continued
in
a
low
voice
singularly
like
the
growl
of
a
wrathful
animal
if
ever
i
meet
that
man
alive
it
will
go
hard
with
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
servant
announced
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
whereupon
the
shortest
creature
that
ever
bore
so
lengthy
a
name
a
dwarf
not
more
than
four
feet
high
wearing
a
frock
coat
and
bright
yellow
gloves
entered
the
room
and
crossing
it
at
a
sort
of
trot
fell
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
madame
brandt
chair
ah
carissima
je
vous
vois
enfin
ach
liebes
herz
que
envie
de
pleurer
madame
brandt
smiled
took
the
creature
head
between
her
hands
and
kissed
his
forehead
she
also
caressed
his
shoulders
my
dear
anastasius
how
good
it
is
to
see
you
where
have
you
been
this
long
time
why
did
you
write
and
let
me
know
you
were
in
england
but
see
anastasius
i
have
visitors
let
me
introduce
she
spoke
in
french
fluently
but
with
a
frank
british
accent
which
grated
on
a
fastidious
ear
the
dwarf
rose
made
two
solemn
bows
and
declared
himself
enchanted
although
his
head
was
too
large
for
his
body
he
was
neither
nor
repulsive
he
looked
about
a
high
forehead
dark
mournful
eyes
and
a
black
moustache
and
imperial
gave
him
an
odd
resemblance
to
napoleon
the
third
i
arrived
from
new
york
this
morning
with
my
cats
oh
a
mad
success
i
have
one
called
phoebus
because
he
drives
a
chariot
drawn
by
six
rats
phoebus
apollo
was
the
god
of
the
sun
i
must
show
him
to
you
madonna
you
would
love
him
as
i
love
you
and
i
also
have
an
angora
my
beautiful
santa
bianca
and
you
gentlemen
he
turned
to
dale
and
myself
and
addressed
us
in
his
peculiar
jargon
of
french
german
and
italian
you
must
come
and
see
my
cats
if
i
can
get
a
london
engagement
at
present
i
must
rest
the
artist
needs
repose
sometimes
i
will
sun
myself
in
the
smiles
of
our
dear
lady
here
and
my
pupil
and
assistant
quast
can
look
after
my
cats
meanwhile
the
brain
of
the
artist
he
tapped
his
brow
needs
to
lie
fallow
so
that
he
can
invent
fresh
and
daring
combinations
do
such
things
interest
you
messieurs
vastly
said
i
he
pulled
out
of
his
breast
pocket
an
enormous
bearing
a
gilt
monogram
of
such
size
that
it
looked
like
a
cartouche
on
an
architectural
panel
and
selected
therefrom
three
cards
which
he
gravely
distributed
among
us
they
bore
the
legend
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos

and
silver
medallist

lane
there
said
he
i
am
always
to
be
found
should
you
ever
require
my
services
i
have
a
masterpiece
in
my
head
i
come
on
to
the
scene
like
bacchus
drawn
by
my
two
cats
how
are
the
cats
to
draw
my
heavy
weight
i
have
a
noiseless
clockwork
arrangement
that
will
really
propel
the
car
you
must
come
and
see
delighted
i
sure
said
dale
who
stood
looking
down
on
the
liliputian
egotist
with
polite
wonder
lola
brandt
glanced
at
him
apologetically
you
must
mind
him
dale
he
has
only
two
ideas
in
his
head
his
cats
and
myself
he
devoted
to
i
do
think
i
shall
be
jealous
said
dale
in
a
low
voice
foolish
boy
she
whispered
during
the
love
scene
which
was
conducted
in
english
a
language
which
papadopoulos
evidently
did
not
understand
the
dwarf
scowled
at
dale
and
twirled
his
moustache
fiercely
in
order
to
attract
madame
attention
he
fetched
a
packet
of
papers
from
his
pocket
and
laid
them
with
a
flourish
on
the
here
are
the
documents
said
he
what
documents
a
full
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
attending
the
death
of
madame
brandt
horse
have
you
found
out
anything
anastasius
she
asked
in
the
indulgent
tone
in
which
one
addresses
an
eager
child
not
exactly
said
he
but
i
have
a
conviction
that
by
this
means
the
murderer
will
be
brought
to
justice
to
this
i
have
devoted
my
life
in
your
he
put
his
hand
on
the
spot
of
his
tightly
buttoned
that
covered
his
heart
and
bowed
profoundly
it
was
obvious
that
he
resented
our
presence
and
desired
to
wipe
us
out
of
our
hostess
consideration
i
glanced
ironically
at
dale
disgusted
face
and
smiled
at
the
imperfect
development
of
his
sense
of
humour
indeed
to
the
young
humour
is
only
a
weapon
of
offence
it
takes
a
philosopher
to
use
it
as
defensive
armour
dale
burned
to
outdo
papadopoulos
i
having
no
such
ambition
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
went
forward
to
take
my
leave
madame
brandt
said
i
old
friends
have
doubtless
much
to
talk
over
i
thank
you
for
the
privilege
you
have
afforded
me
of
making
your
she
rose
and
accompanied
us
to
the
landing
outside
the
flat
door
after
saying
to
dale
who
went
down
with
his
boyish
tread
she
detained
me
for
a
second
or
two
holding
my
hand
and
again
her
clasp
enveloped
it
like
some
clinging
she
looked
at
me
very
wistfully
the
next
time
you
come
de
gex
do
come
as
a
friend
and
not
as
an
i
was
startled
i
thought
i
had
conducted
the
interview
with
peculiar
suavity
an
enemy
dear
lady
yes
ca
i
see
it
she
said
in
her
languorous
caressing
voice
and
i
should
love
to
have
you
for
a
friend
you
could
be
such
a
good
one
i
have
so
i
must
argue
this
out
with
you
another
time
said
i
diplomatically
that
a
promise
said
lola
brandt
what
a
promise
asked
dale
when
i
joined
him
in
the
hall
that
i
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
madame
the
porter
whistled
for
a
cab
a
hansom
drove
up
as
my
destination
was
the
albany
and
as
i
knew
dale
was
going
home
to
eccleston
square
i
held
out
my
hand
dale
i
see
you
but
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
you
think
of
her
he
cried
in
great
dismay
the
pavement
was
muddy
the
evening
dark
and
a
gusty
wind
blew
the
drizzle
into
our
faces
it
is
only
the
preposterously
young
who
expect
a
man
to
rhapsodise
over
somebody
else
inamorata
at
such
a
moment
i
turned
up
the
fur
collar
of
my
coat
she
is
said
i
any
idiot
can
see
that
he
burst
out
impatiently
i
want
to
know
what
opinion
you
formed
of
i
reflected
if
i
could
have
labelled
her
as
the
scarlet
woman
the
martyred
saint
the
jolly
bohemian
or
the
bold
adventuress
my
task
would
have
been
easy
but
i
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
lola
brandt
was
not
to
be
classified
in
so
simple
a
fashion
i
took
refuge
in
a
negative
she
would
hardly
be
a
success
said
i
in
serious
political
with
that
i
made
my
escape
chapter
v
i
wish
i
had
not
called
on
lola
brandt
she
disturbs
me
to
the
point
of
nightmare
in
a
fit
of
dream
paralysis
last
night
i
fancied
myself
stalked
by
a
panther
which
in
the
act
of
springing
turned
into
lola
brandt
what
she
would
have
done
i
know
not
for
i
awoke
but
i
have
a
haunting
sensation
that
she
was
about
to
devour
me
now
a
woman
who
would
devour
a
sleeping
member
of
parliament
is
not
a
fit
consort
for
a
youth
about
to
enter
on
a
political
career
the
woman
worries
me
i
find
myself
speculating
on
her
character
while
i
ought
to
be
minding
my
affairs
and
this
i
do
on
her
own
account
without
any
reference
to
my
undertaking
to
rescue
dale
from
her
clutches
her
obvious
attributes
are
lazy
good
nature
and
swift
intuition
which
are
as
contrary
as
her
tastes
in
tobacco
and
tea
but
beyond
the
obvious
lurks
a
mysterious
animal
power
which
repels
and
attracts
were
not
her
expressions
rather
melancholy
than
sensuous
rather
benevolent
than
cruel
one
might
take
her
as
a
model
for
queen
berenice
or
the
estimable
lady
monarchs
who
yielded
themselves
adorably
to
a
gentleman
kisses
in
the
evening
and
saw
to
it
that
his
head
was
nicely
chopped
off
in
the
morning
i
can
quite
understand
infatuation
she
may
be
as
worthless
as
you
please
but
she
is
by
no
means
the
vulgar
syren
i
was
led
to
expect
i
wish
she
were
my
task
would
be
easier
why
has
he
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
the
chorus
whom
his
congeners
take
out
to
supper
he
is
an
aggravating
fellow
i
have
declined
to
discuss
her
merits
or
demerits
with
him
i
could
scarcely
do
that
with
dignity
said
i
a
remark
which
seemed
to
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
my
honesty
i
asked
what
were
his
intentions
regarding
her
i
discovered
that
they
were
still
indefinite
in
his
exalted
moments
he
talked
of
marriage
but
what
has
become
of
her
husband
i
inquired
drawing
a
bow
at
a
venture
i
suppose
he
dead
said
dale
but
suppose
he
is
he
informed
me
in
his
young
magnificence
that
lola
and
himself
would
be
above
foolish
moral
conventions
indeed
said
i
do
pretend
to
be
a
puritan
said
he
i
do
pretend
to
like
the
idea
anyhow
i
remarked
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
was
not
the
time
for
a
lecture
on
morality
how
do
you
know
that
the
lady
returns
your
passion
i
asked
watching
him
narrowly
he
grew
red
is
that
a
fair
question
yes
said
i
you
invited
me
to
call
on
her
and
judge
the
affair
for
myself
i
doing
it
how
far
have
things
gone
up
to
now
he
flashed
round
on
me
did
i
mean
to
insinuate
that
there
was
anything
wrong
there
was
how
could
i
dream
of
such
a
thing
he
was
vastly
indignant
well
my
dear
boy
said
i
you
just
this
minute
been
scoffing
at
foolish
moral
conventions
if
you
want
to
know
my
opinion
i
continued
after
a
pause
it
is
this
she
does
care
a
scrap
for
of
course
i
was
talking
nonsense
i
did
not
condescend
to
argue
neither
did
i
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
her
affection
had
not
reached
the
point
of
informing
him
whether
she
had
a
husband
and
if
so
whether
he
was
alive
or
dead
this
gives
me
an
idea
suppose
i
can
prove
to
him
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
lady
although
flattered
by
the
devotion
of
a
handsome
young
fellow
of
birth
and
breeding
does
not
as
i
remarked
care
a
scrap
for
him
suppose
i
exhibit
her
to
him
in
the
arms
figuratively
speaking
of
her
husband
providing
one
is
lurking
in
some
of
the
world
anastasius
papadopoulos
a
curate
or
a
champion
wrestler
he
would
do
desperate
things
for
a
month
or
two
but
then
he
would
wake
up
sane
one
fine
morning
and
seek
out
maisie
ellerton
in
a
salutary
state
of
penitence
i
wish
i
knew
a
curate
who
combined
a
passion
for
bears
and
a
yearning
for
ladylike
i
would
take
him
forthwith
to
cadogan
gardens
lola
brandt
and
himself
would
have
tastes
in
common
and
would
fall
in
love
with
each
other
on
the
spot
of
course
there
is
the
other
plan
which
i
have
not
yet
tried
to
arm
myself
with
diplomacy
call
on
madame
brandt
and
working
on
her
feelings
persuade
her
in
the
name
of
the
boy
mother
and
sweetheart
to
make
a
noble
sacrifice
in
the
good
way
but
this
seems
such
an
unhumourous
proceeding
if
i
am
to
achieve
eumoiriety
i
may
as
well
do
it
with
some
distinction
who
doth
time
gallop
withal
asks
orlando
with
a
thief
to
the
gallows
says
rosalind
it
is
true
the
days
have
an
uncanny
way
of
racing
by
i
see
my
little
allotted
span
of
life
shrinking
visibly
like
the
de
i
must
bestir
myself
or
my
last
day
will
come
before
i
have
accomplished
anything
when
i
jotted
down
the
above
not
very
original
memorandum
i
had
passed
a
perfectly
uneumoirous
week
among
my
friends
and
social
acquaintances
i
had
stood
godfather
to
my
sister
agatha
fifth
child
taking
upon
myself
obligations
which
i
shall
never
be
able
to
perform
i
had
dined
amusingly
at
my
sister
jane
i
had
shot
pheasants
at
farfax
glenn
place
in
hampshire
and
i
had
paid
a
charming
visit
to
old
lady
blackadder
when
i
came
back
to
town
however
i
consulted
my
calendar
with
some
anxiety
and
set
out
to
clear
my
path
i
have
now
practically
withdrawn
from
political
life
letters
have
passed
complimentary
and
sympathetic
gentlemen
have
interviewed
me
and
tried
to
weaken
my
decision
the
great
raggles
has
even
called
and
dangled
the
seals
of
office
before
my
eyes
i
said
they
were
very
pretty
he
thought
he
had
tempted
me
hang
on
as
long
as
you
can
for
the
sake
of
the
i
spoke
playfully
of
the
party
a
man
in
my
position
with
one
eye
on
time
and
the
other
on
eternity
develops
an
acute
sense
of
values
and
raggles
held
up
horrified
hands
to
raggles
the
party
is
the
alpha
and
omega
of
things
human
and
divine
it
is
the
guiding
principle
of
the
cosmos
i
could
have
spoken
disrespectfully
of
the
british
empire
of
which
he
has
a
confused
notion
i
could
have
dismissed
the
trinity
on
which
his
ideas
are
vaguer
with
an
airy
jest
in
the
expression
of
my
views
concerning
the
creator
whom
he
believes
to
be
under
the
protection
i
could
have
tom
paine
leo
taxil
and
he
would
not
have
winced
but
to
blaspheme
against
the
party
was
the
sin
for
which
there
was
no
redemption
i
always
thought
you
a
serious
politician
he
gasped
good
god
i
cried
in
my
public
utterances
have
i
been
as
dull
as
that
or
no
it
is
time
for
me
to
quit
the
he
laughed
politely
because
he
conjectured
i
was
speaking
humourously
he
is
astute
in
some
things
and
begged
me
to
explain
i
replied
that
i
did
not
regard
mustard
poultices
as
panaceas
the
as
the
or
the
policy
of
the
other
side
as
the
machinations
of
the
devil
that
politics
was
all
a
game
of
and
muddle
and
compromise
at
the
best
that
at
the
worst
as
during
a
general
election
it
was
as
ignoble
a
pastime
as
the
wit
of
man
had
devised
to
take
it
seriously
would
be
the
course
of
a
fanatic
a
man
devoid
of
the
sense
of
proportion
were
such
a
man
i
asked
fitted
to
govern
the
country
he
did
not
stop
to
argue
but
went
away
leaving
me
the
conviction
that
he
thanked
his
stars
on
the
government
providential
escape
from
so
maniacal
a
minister
i
hope
i
did
not
treat
him
with
any
discourtesy
but
oh
it
was
good
to
speak
the
truth
after
all
the
dismal
lies
i
have
been
forced
to
tell
at
the
bidding
of
raggle
party
now
that
i
am
no
longer
bound
by
the
rules
of
the
game
it
is
good
to
feel
a
free
honest
man
never
again
shall
i
stretch
forth
my
arms
and
thunder
invectives
against
people
with
whom
in
my
heart
i
secretly
sympathise
never
again
shall
i
plead
passionately
for
principles
which
a
horrible
instinct
tells
me
are
fundamentally
futile
never
again
shall
i
attempt
to
make
mountains
out
of
or
bricks
without
straw
or
sunbeams
out
of
cucumbers
i
shall
conduct
no
more
inquiries
into
pauper
lunacy
thank
heaven
and
as
for
the
public
engagements
which
dale
kynnersley
made
for
me
during
my
thebaid
existence
on
the
deuce
can
take
them
all
i
am
free
i
only
await
the
stewardship
of
the
chiltern
hundreds
for
which
quaint
post
under
the
crown
i
applied
to
cease
to
be
a
member
of
parliament
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
my
fine
and
superior
talk
i
am
glad
i
am
giving
up
in
the
recess
i
should
not
like
to
be
out
of
my
seat
were
the
house
in
session
i
should
hate
to
think
of
all
the
fascinating
excitement
over
nothing
going
on
in
the
lobbies
without
me
while
i
am
still
hale
and
hearty
when
parliament
meets
in
february
i
shall
either
be
comfortably
dead
or
so
uncomfortably
alive
that
i
shall
not
care
que
que
de
nous
i
wonder
how
far
simon
de
gex
and
i
are
deceiving
each
other
there
is
no
deception
about
my
old
friend
latimer
who
called
on
me
a
day
or
two
ago
he
is
on
the
stock
exchange
and
creature
that
he
is
has
been
bearing
the
wrong
things
they
have
gone
up
is
drawing
near
and
how
to
pay
for
the
shares
he
is
bound
to
deliver
he
has
not
the
faintest
notion
he
stamped
up
and
down
the
room
called
down
curses
on
the
prying
fools
who
came
across
the
unexpected
streak
of
copper
in
the
failing
mine
drew
pictures
of
his
wife
and
family
singing
hymns
in
the
street
and
asked
me
for
a
drink
of
prussic
acid
i
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
rogers
to
give
him
a
brandy
and
soda
now
said
i
talk
sense
how
much
can
you
raise
he
went
into
figures
and
showed
me
that
although
he
stretched
his
credit
to
the
utmost
there
were
still
ten
thousand
pounds
to
be
provided
it
utter
smash
and
ruin
he
groaned
and
all
my
accursed
folly
i
thought
i
was
going
to
make
a
fortune
but
i
done
for
latimer
is
usually
a
pink
man
now
he
was
white
and
flabby
a
piteous
spectacle
you
are
executor
under
my
will
he
continued
heaven
knows
i
nothing
to
leave
but
you
see
things
straight
for
me
if
anything
happens
you
will
look
after
lucy
and
the
kids
you
i
was
on
the
point
of
undertaking
to
do
so
in
the
event
of
the
continuance
of
his
craving
for
prussic
acid
when
i
reflected
upon
my
own
approaching
bow
and
farewell
to
the
world
where
lucy
and
the
kids
would
still
be
wandering
i
am
always
being
brought
up
against
this
final
fireproof
curtain
suddenly
a
thought
came
which
caused
me
to
exult
exceedingly
ten
thousand
pounds
my
dear
latimer
said
i
would
save
you
from
being
hammered
on
the
stock
exchange
and
from
seeking
a
suicide
grave
it
would
also
enable
you
to
maintain
lucy
and
the
kids
in
your
luxurious
house
at
hampstead
and
to
take
them
as
usual
to
dieppe
next
summer
am
i
not
right
he
begged
me
not
to
make
a
jest
of
his
miseries
it
was
like
asking
a
starving
beggar
whether
a
dinner
at
the
carlton
would
set
him
up
again
would
ten
thousand
set
you
up
i
persisted
yes
but
i
might
as
well
try
to
raise
ten
not
so
i
cried
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
i
myself
will
lend
you
the
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
stared
at
me
wildly
in
the
face
he
could
not
have
been
more
electrified
if
he
had
seen
me
suddenly
adorned
with
wings
and
shining
raiment
i
experienced
a
thrill
of
eumoiriety
more
exquisite
than
i
had
dreamed
of
imagining
you
why
not
you
do
understand
i
can
give
you
no
security
i
do
want
security
and
i
do
want
interest
i
exclaimed
feeling
more
magnanimous
than
i
had
a
right
to
be
seeing
that
the
interest
would
be
of
no
use
to
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
styx
pay
me
back
when
and
how
you
like
come
round
with
me
to
my
bankers
and
i
settle
the
matter
at
he
put
out
his
hands
i
thought
he
was
about
to
fall
at
my
feet
he
laughed
in
a
silly
way
and
groping
after
brandy
and
soda
poured
half
the
contents
of
the
brandy
decanter
on
to
the
tray
i
took
him
in
a
cab
a
stupefied
man
to
the
bank
and
when
he
left
me
at
the
door
with
my
draft
in
his
pocket
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
wrung
my
hand
and
murmured
something
incoherent
about
lucy
for
heaven
sake
do
tell
her
anything
about
it
i
entreated
i
love
lucy
dearly
as
you
know
but
i
do
want
to
have
her
weeping
on
my
i
walked
back
to
my
rooms
with
a
springing
step
so
happy
was
i
that
i
should
have
liked
to
dance
down
piccadilly
if
the
faculty
had
not
made
their
pronouncement
i
could
have
no
more
turned
poor
latimer
earth
from
hell
to
heaven
than
i
could
have
changed
paul
cathedral
into
a
bumblebee
the
mere
possibility
of
lending
him
the
money
would
not
have
occurred
to
me
a
man
of
modest
fortune
does
not
go
about
playing
monte
cristo
he
gives
away
a
few
guineas
in
charity
but
he
keeps
the
bulk
of
his
fortune
to
himself
the
death
sentence
i
vow
has
compensations
it
enables
a
man
to
play
monte
cristo
or
any
other
avatar
of
providence
with
impunity
and
i
have
discovered
it
to
be
the
most
fascinating
game
in
the
world
when
latimer
recovers
his
equilibrium
and
regards
the
transaction
in
the
dry
light
of
reason
he
will
diagnose
a
sure
symptom
of
megalomania
and
will
pity
me
in
his
heart
for
a
poor
devil
i
have
seen
eleanor
faversham
and
she
has
released
me
from
my
engagement
with
such
grace
dignity
and
sweet
womanliness
that
i
wonder
how
i
could
have
railed
at
her
thousand
virtues
it
honourable
of
you
to
give
me
this
opportunity
of
breaking
it
off
simon
she
said
but
i
care
enough
for
you
to
be
willing
to
take
my
chance
of
you
do
care
for
me
i
asked
she
raised
astonished
eyes
if
i
did
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
engaged
myself
to
you
if
i
married
you
i
should
swear
to
cherish
you
in
sickness
and
in
health
why
wo
you
let
me
i
was
in
a
difficulty
to
say
that
i
was
in
and
about
to
resign
my
seat
in
parliament
and
a
slave
to
doctor
orders
was
one
thing
it
was
another
to
tell
her
brutally
that
i
had
received
my
death
warrant
she
would
have
taken
it
much
more
to
heart
than
i
do
the
announcement
would
have
been
a
shock
it
would
have
kept
the
poor
girl
awake
of
nights
she
would
have
been
for
ever
seeing
the
hand
of
death
at
my
throat
every
time
we
met
she
would
have
noted
on
my
face
in
my
gait
infallible
signs
of
my
approaching
end
i
had
not
the
right
to
inflict
such
intolerable
pain
on
one
so
near
and
dear
to
me
besides
i
am
vain
enough
to
want
to
walk
forth
somewhat
gallantly
into
eternity
and
while
i
yet
live
i
particularly
desire
that
folks
should
not
regard
me
as
i
defy
you
to
treat
a
man
who
is
only
going
to
live
twenty
weeks
in
the
same
pleasant
fashion
as
you
would
a
man
who
has
the
run
of
life
before
him
there
is
always
an
instinctive
shrinking
from
decay
i
should
think
that
corpses
must
feel
their
position
acutely
it
was
entirely
for
eleanor
sake
that
i
refrained
from
taking
her
into
my
confidence
to
her
question
i
replied
that
i
had
not
the
right
to
tie
her
for
life
to
a
helpless
valetudinarian
besides
said
i
as
my
health
grows
worse
my
jokes
will
deteriorate
until
i
am
reduced
to
grinning
through
a
at
the
doctor
and
you
could
stand
that
could
you
she
upbraided
me
gently
for
treating
everything
as
a
jest
it
is
that
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
simon
she
asked
tearfully
but
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
i
took
both
hands
and
looked
into
her
eyes
they
are
brave
truthful
eyes
and
through
my
heart
shot
a
great
pain
till
that
moment
i
had
not
realised
what
i
was
giving
up
the
pleasant
paths
of
the
world
i
could
leave
them
behind
with
a
shrug
political
ambition
power
i
could
justly
estimate
their
value
and
could
let
them
pass
into
other
hands
without
regret
but
here
was
the
true
staunch
woman
great
of
heart
and
wise
a
helper
and
a
comrade
and
if
i
chose
to
throw
off
the
jester
and
become
the
lover
in
real
earnest
and
sweep
my
hand
across
the
hidden
chords
all
that
a
woman
can
become
towards
the
man
she
loves
i
realised
this
i
realised
that
if
she
did
not
love
me
passionately
now
it
was
only
because
i
in
my
foolishness
had
willed
it
otherwise
for
the
first
time
i
longed
to
have
her
as
my
own
for
the
first
time
i
rebelled
i
looked
at
her
hungeringly
until
her
cheeks
grew
red
and
her
eyelids
fluttered
i
had
a
wild
impulse
to
throw
my
arms
around
her
and
kiss
her
as
i
had
never
kissed
her
before
and
bid
her
forget
all
that
i
had
said
that
day
her
faltering
eyes
told
me
that
they
read
my
longing
i
was
about
to
yield
when
the
little
devil
of
a
pain
inside
made
itself
sharply
felt
and
my
madness
went
from
me
i
fetched
a
thing
between
a
sigh
and
a
groan
and
dropped
her
hands
need
i
answer
your
question
i
asked
she
turned
her
head
aside
and
whispered
presently
she
said
i
am
glad
i
came
back
from
sicily
i
should
have
liked
you
to
write
this
to
me
i
should
have
do
you
now
i
think
she
looked
at
me
frankly
until
just
now
i
was
never
quite
certain
whether
you
really
cared
for
i
never
cared
for
you
so
much
as
i
do
now
when
i
have
to
lose
and
you
must
lose
me
a
man
in
my
condition
would
be
a
scoundrel
if
he
married
a
then
it
is
very
very
serious
your
illness
yes
said
i
very
serious
i
must
give
you
your
freedom
whether
you
want
it
or
she
passed
one
hand
over
the
other
on
her
knee
looking
at
the
engagement
ring
then
she
took
it
off
and
presented
it
to
me
lying
in
the
palm
of
her
right
hand
do
what
you
like
with
it
she
said
very
softly
i
took
the
ring
and
slipped
it
on
one
of
the
fingers
it
would
comfort
me
to
think
that
you
are
wearing
it
said
i
then
her
mother
came
into
the
room
and
eleanor
went
out
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
faversham
who
is
a
woman
only
guided
by
sentiment
when
it
leads
to
a
worldly
advantage
applauded
the
step
i
had
taken
as
a
sprightly
member
of
parliament
with
an
assured
political
and
social
position
i
had
been
a
most
desirable
as
an
obscure
invalid
coughing
and
spitting
from
a
at
bournemouth
she
took
it
for
granted
that
i
was
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
i
did
not
take
the
lady
fancy
my
dear
simon
replied
my
lost
you
have
behaved
irreproachably
eleanor
will
feel
it
for
some
time
no
doubt
but
she
is
young
and
will
soon
get
over
it
i
send
her
to
the
in
paris
and
as
for
yourself
your
terrible
misfortune
will
be
as
much
as
you
can
bear
you
must
increase
it
by
any
worries
on
her
behalf
in
that
way
i
do
my
utmost
to
help
you
are
kindness
itself
faversham
said
i
bowed
over
the
delighted
lady
hand
and
went
away
deeply
moved
by
her
charity
and
maternal
devotion
but
perhaps
in
her
hardness
lies
truth
i
have
never
touched
heart
no
romance
had
preceded
or
accompanied
our
engagement
the
deepest
truest
incident
in
it
has
been
our
parting
chapter
vi
dale
occupation
like
othello
being
gone
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
lady
kynnersley
has
despatched
him
to
berlin
on
her
own
business
connected
i
think
with
the
international
aid
society
he
is
to
stay
there
for
a
fortnight
how
he
proposes
to
bear
the
separation
from
the
object
of
his
flame
i
have
not
inquired
but
if
forcible
objurgations
in
the
vulgar
tongue
have
any
inner
significance
i
gather
that
lady
kynnersley
has
not
employed
an
enthusiastic
agent
being
thus
free
to
pursue
my
eumoirous
schemes
without
his
intervention
for
you
can
not
talk
to
a
lady
for
her
soul
good
when
her
adorer
is
gaping
at
you
i
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
see
something
of
lola
brandt
i
find
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
and
it
seems
not
improbable
that
i
shall
see
considerably
more
deuce
take
the
woman
on
the
first
afternoon
of
dale
absence
i
paid
her
my
promised
visit
it
was
a
dull
day
and
the
room
lit
chiefly
by
the
firelight
happily
did
not
reveal
its
tastelessness
lola
brandt
and
talked
to
me
from
the
cushioned
depths
of
her
chair
we
lightly
touched
on
dale
trip
to
berlin
she
would
miss
him
terribly
it
was
so
kind
of
me
to
come
and
cheer
her
lonely
hour
politeness
forbade
my
saying
that
i
had
come
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
to
my
vague
expression
of
courtesy
she
responded
by
asking
me
with
a
laugh
how
i
liked
anastasius
papadopoulos
i
replied
that
i
considered
it
urbane
on
his
part
to
invite
me
to
see
his
cats
perform
if
you
were
to
hurt
one
of
his
cats
he
murder
you
she
informed
me
he
always
carries
a
long
sharp
knife
concealed
somewhere
about
him
on
what
a
fierce
little
gentleman
i
remarked
he
looks
on
me
as
one
of
his
cats
too
she
said
with
a
low
laugh
and
considers
himself
my
protector
once
in
he
and
i
were
driving
about
i
was
doing
some
shopping
as
i
was
getting
into
the
cab
a
man
insulted
me
on
account
i
suppose
of
my
german
name
anastasius
sprang
at
him
like
a
wild
beast
and
i
had
to
drag
him
off
bodily
and
lift
him
back
into
the
cab
i
pretty
strong
you
know
it
must
have
been
a
funny
she
turned
to
me
quickly
do
you
think
it
wrong
of
me
to
laugh
why
should
you
laugh
at
the
absurd
because
in
devotion
like
that
there
seems
to
be
something
solemn
and
frightening
if
i
told
him
to
kill
his
cats
he
would
do
it
if
i
ordered
him
to
commit
on
the
hearthrug
he
would
whip
out
his
knife
and
obey
me
when
you
have
a
human
soul
at
your
mercy
like
that
it
a
kind
of
sacrilege
to
laugh
at
it
it
makes
you
feel
oh
i
express
myself
look
it
does
make
tears
come
into
your
eyes
exactly
it
makes
them
come
into
your
we
continued
the
subject
divagating
as
we
went
and
had
a
nice
little
sentimental
conversation
there
are
depths
of
human
feeling
i
should
never
have
suspected
in
this
lazy
panther
of
a
woman
and
although
she
openly
avows
having
no
more
education
than
a
tinker
dog
she
can
talk
with
considerable
force
and
vividness
of
expression
indeed
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
a
tinker
dog
has
a
fine
education
if
he
be
naturally
a
shrewd
animal
and
takes
advantage
of
his
opportunities
and
a
fine
education
too
of
its
kind
was
that
of
the
vagabond
lola
who
on
her
way
from
dublin
to
yokohama
had
more
profitably
employed
her
time
than
lady
kynnersley
supposed
she
had
seen
much
of
the
civilised
places
of
the
earth
in
her
wanderings
from
engagement
to
engagement
and
had
been
an
acute
observer
of
men
and
things
we
exchanged
travel
pictures
and
reminiscences
i
found
myself
floating
with
her
through
moonlit
venice
while
she
chanted
with
startling
exactness
the
cry
of
the
gondoliers
to
my
confusion
be
it
spoken
i
forgot
all
about
dale
kynnersley
and
my
mission
the
lazy
voice
and
rich
personality
fascinated
me
when
i
rose
to
go
i
found
i
had
spent
a
couple
of
hours
in
her
company
she
took
me
round
the
room
and
showed
me
some
of
her
treasures
this
is
very
old
i
think
it
is
fifteenth
century
she
said
picking
up
an
italian
ivory
it
was
i
expressed
my
admiration
then
maliciously
i
pointed
to
a
horrible
little
tyrolean
chalet
and
said
that
too
is
very
it
is
and
you
know
she
is
a
most
disconcerting
creature
i
accepted
the
rebuke
meekly
what
else
could
i
do
why
then
do
you
have
it
here
it
a
present
from
anastasius
she
said
every
time
he
comes
to
see
me
he
brings
what
he
calls
an
all
these
things
she
indicated
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
the
arm
the
union
jack
cushion
the
little
men
mounting
ladders
inside
bottles
the
hen
sitting
on
her
nest
and
the
other
trumpery
gimcracks
all
these
things
are
presents
from
anastasius
it
would
hurt
him
not
to
see
them
here
when
he
you
might
have
a
separate
cabinet
i
suggested
a
chamber
of
horrors
she
laughed
no
it
gives
him
more
pleasure
to
see
them
as
they
are
and
a
poor
little
freak
does
get
much
out
of
she
sighed
and
picking
up
a
present
from
margate
kind
of
mug
fingered
it
very
tenderly
i
went
away
feeling
angry
was
the
woman
bewitching
me
and
i
felt
angrier
still
when
i
met
lady
kynnersley
at
dinner
that
evening
luckily
i
had
only
a
few
words
with
her
had
i
done
anything
yet
with
regard
to
dale
and
the
unmentionable
woman
if
i
had
told
her
that
i
had
spent
a
most
agreeable
afternoon
with
the
enchantress
she
would
not
have
enjoyed
her
evening
like
general
trochu
of
the
siege
of
paris
fame
i
said
in
my
most
mysterious
manner
i
have
my
plan
and
sent
her
into
dinner
comforted
but
i
had
no
plan
my
next
interview
with
madame
brandt
brought
me
no
further
we
have
established
telephonic
communications
through
the
medium
of
this
diabolical
engine
of
loquacity
and
indiscretion
i
was
prevailed
on
to
accompany
her
to
a
rehearsal
of
anastasius
cats
rogers
with
a
face
as
imperturbable
as
if
he
was
announcing
the
visit
of
an
archbishop
informed
me
at
the
appointed
hour
that
madame
brougham
was
at
the
door
i
went
down
and
found
the
brougham
open
as
the
day
was
fine
and
lola
brandt
smiling
under
a
gigantic
hat
with
an
amazing
black
feather
and
looking
as
handsome
as
you
please
we
were
blocked
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
mouth
of
the
courtyard
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
all
piccadilly
that
passed
staring
at
us
in
admiration
lola
brandt
liked
it
but
i
did
especially
when
i
recognised
one
of
the
starers
as
the
eldest
boy
whose
people
in
paris
are
receiving
eleanor
faversham
under
their
protection
a
nice
reputation
i
shall
be
acquiring
my
companion
was
in
gay
mood
now
as
it
is
no
part
of
dealing
unto
oneself
a
happy
life
and
portion
to
damp
a
fellow
creature
spirits
i
responded
with
commendable
gaiety
i
own
that
the
drive
to
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
cattery
in
rosebery
avenue
clerkenwell
was
distinctly
enjoyable
i
forgot
all
about
the
little
pain
inside
and
the
fury
with
the
abhorred
shears
and
talked
a
vast
amount
of
nonsense
which
the
lady
was
pleased
to
regard
as
wit
for
she
laughed
wholeheartedly
showing
her
strong
white
even
teeth
but
why
was
i
going
was
it
because
she
had
requested
me
through
the
telephone
to
give
unimagined
happiness
to
a
poor
little
freak
who
would
be
as
proud
as
punch
to
exhibit
his
cats
to
an
english
member
of
parliament
was
it
in
order
to
further
my
designs
machiavellian
towards
the
lady
but
eumoirous
towards
dale
or
was
it
simply
for
my
own
good
pleasure
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
resplendently
raimented
with
the
shiniest
of
silk
hats
and
a
flower
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
received
us
at
the
door
of
a
small
house
the
windows
of
which
announced
the
tenancy
of
a
maker
of
gymnastic
appliances
and
having
kissed
madame
brandt
hand
with
awful
solemnity
and
bowed
deeply
to
me
he
preceded
us
down
the
passage
out
into
the
yard
and
into
a
ramshackle
studio
at
the
end
where
his
cats
had
their
being
there
were
fourteen
of
them
curled
up
in
large
cages
standing
against
the
walls
the
place
was
lit
by
a
skylight
and
warmed
by
a
stove
the
floor
like
a
stage
was
fitted
up
with
miniature
acrobatic
paraphernalia
and
properties
there
were
little
gates
and
trapezes
and
and
and
a
all
the
metal
work
gleaming
like
silver
a
heavy
uncouth
german
lad
whom
the
professor
introduced
as
his
pupil
and
assistant
quast
was
in
attendance
papadopoulos
polyglotically
acknowledged
the
honour
i
had
conferred
upon
him
he
is
very
like
the
late
emperor
of
the
french
but
his
forehead
is
bulgier
with
a
theatrical
gesture
and
the
remark
that
i
should
see
he
opened
some
cages
and
released
half
a
dozen
cats
a
persian
a
white
angora
and
four
commonplace
tabbies
who
all
sprang
on
to
the
table
with
military
precision
madame
brand
began
to
caress
them
i
wishing
to
show
interest
in
the
troupe
prepared
to
do
the
same
but
the
dwarf
scurried
up
with
a
screech
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
ne

i
refrained
somewhat
wonderingly
from
touching
madame
brandt
explained
he
thinks
you
would
spoil
the
magnetic
influence
it
is
a
superstition
of
but
you
are
he
believes
i
have
his
magnetism
whatever
that
may
be
she
said
with
a
smile
would
you
like
to
see
an
experiment
anastasius
is
that
the
untamed
persian
you
were
telling
me
of
she
asked
pointing
to
a
cage
from
which
a
ferocious
gigantic
animal
more
like
a
woolly
tiger
than
a
looked
out
with
expressionless
yellow
eyes
will
you
let
de
gex
try
to
make
friends
with
it
your
will

replied
professor
papadopoulos
bowing
low
but
hephaestus
is
as
fierce
as
the
flames
of
see
what
he

laughed
lola
brandt
i
approached
the
cage
with
an
ingratiating
puss
puss
and
a
hideous
growl
welcomed
me
i
ventured
my
hand
towards
the
bars
the
beast
bristled
in
demoniac
wrath
spat
with
malignant
venom
and
shot
out
its
claws
if
i
had
touched
it
my
hand
would
have
been
torn
to
shreds
i
have
never
seen
a
more
malevolent
fierce
spiteful
brute
in
my
life
my
feelings
being
somewhat
hurt
and
my
nerves
a
bit
shaken
i
retreated
hastily
now
look
said
lola
brandt
with
absolute
fearlessness
she
went
up
to
the
cage
opened
it
took
the
unresisting
thing
out
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
held
it
up
like
a
and
put
it
on
her
shoulder
where
it
forthwith
began
to
purr
like
any
harmless
necessary
cat
and
rub
its
head
against
her
cheek
she
put
it
on
the
floor
it
arched
its
back
and
circling
sideways
rubbed
itself
against
her
skirts
she
sat
down
and
taking
the
brute
by
its
forepaws
made
it
stand
on
its
hind
legs
she
pulled
it
on
to
her
lap
and
it
curled
round
lazily
then
she
hoisted
it
on
to
her
shoulder
again
and
rising
crossed
the
room
and
bowed
to
the
level
of
the
cage
when
the
beast
leaped
in
purring
thunderously
in
high
good
humour
papadopoulos
sang
out
in
breathless
delight
if
i
am
the
king
of
cats
you
carissima
are
the
queen
nay
more
you
are
the
goddess
lola
brandt
laughed
i
did
not
it
was
uncanny
it
seemed
as
if
some
mysterious
freemasonic
affinity
existed
between
her
and
the
evil
beast
during
her
drive
hither
she
had
entered
my
own
atmosphere
she
had
been
the
handsome
unconventional
woman
of
the
world
now
she
seemed
as
remote
from
me
as
the
witches
in
if
i
had
seen
her
dashing
paris
hat
rise
up
into
a
point
and
her
umbrella
turn
into
a
broomstick
and
herself
into
one
of
the
buxom
carlines
of
tam
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
the
feats
of
the
mild
pussies
which
the
dwarf
began
forthwith
to
exhibit
provoked
in
me
but
a
polite
counterfeit
of
enthusiasm
lola
brandt
had
discounted
my
interest
even
his
performance
with
the
ferocious
persian
lacked
the
diabolical
certainty
of
lola
handling
he
locked
all
the
other
cats
up
and
enticed
it
out
of
the
cage
with
a
piece
of
fish
he
guided
it
with
a
small
whip
as
it
jumped
over
gates
and
through
blazing
hoops
and
he
stood
tense
and
concentrated
like
a
the
act
over
the
cat
turned
and
snarled
and
only
jumped
into
its
cage
after
a
smart
flick
of
the
whip
the
dwarf
did
not
touch
it
once
with
his
hands
i
applauded
however
and
complimented
him
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
bent
forward
in
humility
ah
monsieur
i
am
but
a
neophyte
where
madame
is
an
expert
i
know
the
superficial
nature
of
cats
now
and
then
without
vainglory
i
can
say
i
know
their
hearts
but
madame
penetrates
to
and
holds
commune
with
their
souls
and
a
cat
soul
monsieur
is
a
wonderful
thing
once
it
was
divine
in
ancient
egypt
doubtless
monsieur
has
heard
of
pasht
holy
men
spent
their
lives
in
approaching
the
madame
was
born
to
the
privilege
pasht
watches
over
pasht
i
said
politely
in
french
in
reply
to
this
clotted
nonsense
was
a
great
divinity
and
for
yourself
who
knows
but
what
you
may
have
been
in
a
previous
incarnation
the
keeper
of
the
sacred
cats
in
some
egyptian
i
was
he
said
with
staggering
earnestness
at
one
of
these
days
i
returned
with
equal
solemnity
i
hope
for
the
privilege
of
hearing
some
of
your
reminiscences
they
would
no
doubt
be
on
the
way
back
lola
thanked
me
for
pretending
to
take
the
little
man
seriously
and
not
laughing
at
him
if
i
had
said
i
he
would
have
stuck
his
knife
into
she
shook
her
head
you
did
it
naturally
i
was
watching
you
it
is
because
you
are
a
said
i
if
you
talk
like
that
i
get
out
and
and
indeed
what
right
had
she
to
characterise
the
moral
condition
of
my
heart
i
asked
her
she
laughed
her
low
lazy
laugh
but
made
no
reply
presently
she
said
why
did
you
like
my
making
friends
with
the
cat
how
do
you
know
i
did
like
it
i
asked
i
felt
you
must
feel
things
like
that
i
remarked
it
is
good
for
she
insisted
on
my
telling
her
i
explained
as
well
as
i
could
she
touched
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
with
her
gloved
hand
i
glad
because
it
shows
you
take
an
interest
in
me
and
i
wanted
to
let
you
see
that
i
could
do
something
besides
loll
about
in
a
and
smoke
cigarettes
it
all
i
can
do
but
she
said
it
with
the
humility
of
the
jongleur
de
notre
dame
in
anatole
frances
story
in
eaton
square
where
i
had
a
luncheon
engagement
she
dropped
me
and
drove
off
smiling
evidently
well
pleased
with
herself
my
hostess
was
standing
by
the
window
when
i
was
shown
into
the
i
noted
the
faintest
possible
little
malicious
twinkle
in
her
eye
during
the
afternoon
i
had
a
telephonic
message
from
my
doctor
who
asked
me
why
i
had
neglected
him
for
a
fortnight
and
urged
me
to
go
to
harley
street
at
once
to
humour
him
i
went
the
next
morning
hunnington
is
a
bluff
hearty
fellow
who
feeds
himself
into
pink
floridity
so
as
to
give
confidence
to
his
patients
in
answer
to
his
renewed
inquiry
as
to
my
neglect
i
remarked
that
a
man
condemned
to
be
hanged
does
seek
interviews
with
the
judge
in
order
to
learn
how
the
rope
is
getting
on
i
conveyed
to
him
politely
although
he
is
an
old
friend
that
i
desired
to
forget
his
existence
in
his
chatty
way
he
requested
me
not
to
be
an
ass
and
proceeded
to
put
to
me
the
usual
silly
questions
remembering
the
result
of
my
last
visit
i
made
him
happy
by
answering
them
gloomily
whereupon
he
seized
his
opportunity
and
ordered
me
out
of
england
for
the
winter
i
must
go
to
a
warm
climate
egypt
south
africa
madeira
i
could
take
my
choice
i
flatly
refused
to
obey
i
had
my
duties
in
london
he
was
so
unsympathetic
as
to
damn
my
duties
my
duty
was
to
live
as
long
as
possible
and
my
wintering
in
london
would
probably
curtail
my
short
life
by
two
months
then
i
turned
on
him
and
explained
the
charitable
disingenuousness
of
my
replies
to
his
questions
he
refused
to
believe
me
and
we
parted
with
mutual
recriminations
i
sent
him
next
day
however
a
brace
of
pheasants
a
present
from
farfax
glenn
after
all
he
is
one
of
god
creatures
the
next
time
i
called
on
lola
brandt
i
went
with
the
fixed
determination
to
make
some
progress
in
my
mission
i
vowed
that
i
would
not
be
seduced
by
trumpery
conversation
about
yokohama
or
allow
my
mind
to
be
distracted
by
absurd
adventures
among
cats
i
would
clothe
myself
in
the
armour
of
eumoiriety
and
with
the
sword
of
duty
in
my
hand
would
go
forth
to
battle
with
the
enchantress
all
said
and
done
what
was
she
but
a
strapping
woman
without
an
idea
in
her
head
save
the
enslavement
of
an
impressionable
boy
several
years
her
junior
it
was
preposterous
that
i
simon
de
gex
who
had
beguiled
and
fooled
an
electorate
of
thirty
thousand
men
into
choosing
me
for
their
representative
in
parliament
should
not
be
a
match
for
lola
brandt
as
for
her
complicated
feminine
personality
her
intuitiveness
her
magnetism
her
fascination
all
the
qualities
in
fact
which
my
poetical
fancy
had
assigned
to
her
they
had
no
existence
in
reality
she
was
the
most
commonplace
person
i
had
ever
encountered
and
i
had
been
but
a
sentimental
lunatic
in
this
truly
admirable
frame
of
mind
i
entered
her
she
threw
down
the
penny
novel
she
was
reading
and
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
sprang
forward
to
greet
me
i
so
glad
you
come
i
was
getting
the
blind
hump
did
i
not
say
she
was
commonplace
i
hate
this
synonym
for
boredom
it
may
be
elegant
in
the
mouth
of
a
duchess
and
pathetic
in
that
of
an
but
it
falls
vulgarly
from
intermediate
lips
what
has
given
it
to
you
i
asked
my
poor
little
ouistiti
is
dead
it
is
this
abominable
i
murmured
condolences
i
could
not
exhibit
unreasonable
grief
at
the
demise
of
a
sick
monkey
which
i
had
never
seen
i
also
out
of
books
she
said
after
having
paid
her
tribute
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
i
have
been
forced
to
ask
the
servants
to
lend
me
something
to
read
have
you
ever
tried
this
sort
of
thing
you
ought
to
it
tells
you
what
goes
on
in
high
i
was
sure
it
did
not
a
duchess
in
its
pages
talked
about
having
a
blind
hump
i
said
gravely
i
will
ask
you
to
lend
it
to
me
since
dale
has
been
away
i
had
no
one
to
make
out
my
library
do
turn
adolphus
out
of
that
chair
and
sit
down
she
said
sinking
into
her
accustomed
seat
adolphus
was
the
chow
dog
before
mentioned
an
accomplished
animal
who
could
mount
guard
with
the
poker
and
stand
on
his
head
and
had
been
pleased
to
favour
me
with
his
friendship
i
miss
dale
greatly
said
i
i
suppose
you
do
you
are
very
fond
of
him
very
said
i
by
the
by
how
did
you
first
come
across
dale
she
threw
me
a
swift
glance
and
smiled
oh
in
the
most
respectable
way
i
was
dining
at
the
carlton
with
sir
joshua
oldfield
the
famous
surgeon
you
know
he
performed
a
silly
little
operation
on
me
last
year
and
since
then
we
been
great
friends
dale
and
some
sort
of
baby
boy
were
dining
there
too
and
afterwards
in
the
lounge
sir
joshua
introduced
them
to
me
dale
asked
me
if
he
could
call
i
said
perhaps
i
was
wrong
anyhow
do
you
know
sir
joshua
i
sat
next
to
him
once
at
a
public
dinner
he
a
friend
of
the
kynnersleys
a
genial
old
he
a
dear
said
lola
do
you
know
many
of
dale
friends
i
asked
hardly
any
she
replied
it
rather
then
she
broke
into
a
laugh
i
was
so
terrified
at
meeting
you
the
first
time
dale
can
talk
of
no
one
else
he
makes
a
kind
of
god
of
you
i
felt
i
was
going
to
hate
you
like
the
devil
i
expected
quite
a
different
the
diplomatist
listens
to
much
and
says
little
indeed
i
remarked
she
nodded
i
thought
you
would
be
a
big
beefy
man
with
a
red
face
you
know
he
gave
me
the
idea
somehow
by
calling
you
a
chap
you
see
i
could
think
of
a
chap
with
a
white
face
and
a
waxed
moustache
and
your
way
of
i
am
sorry
said
i
not
to
come
up
to
your
idea
of
the
but
you
do
she
cried
with
one
of
her
supple
twists
of
the
body
it
was
i
that
was
stupid
and
i
do
hate
you
at
all
you
can
see
that
i
do
i
did
even
hate
you
when
you
came
as
an
ah
said
i
what
made
you
think
that
we
agreed
to
argue
it
out
if
you
she
drew
out
of
a
case
beside
her
one
of
her
unspeakable
cigarettes
do
you
suppose
she
said
lighting
it
and
pausing
to
inhale
the
first
two
or
three
puffs
of
smoke
do
you
suppose
that
a
woman
who
has
lived
among
wild
beasts
has
got
instinct
i
drew
my
chair
nearer
to
the
fire
she
was
beginning
to
be
uncanny
again
i
expected
you
were
going
to
be
horrified
at
the
dreadful
creature
your
friend
had
taken
up
with
oh
yes
i
know
in
the
eyes
of
your
class
i
a
dreadful
creature
i
like
a
cat
in
many
ways
i
suspicious
of
strangers
especially
strangers
of
your
class
and
i
sniff
and
sniff
until
i
feel
it
all
right
after
the
first
few
minutes
i
felt
you
were
all
right
you
true
and
honourable
like
dale
are
you
like
a
panther
making
a
sudden
spring
she
sat
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
as
she
launched
this
challenge
at
me
now
it
is
disconcerting
to
a
man
to
have
a
woman
leap
at
his
throat
and
ask
him
whether
he
is
true
and
honourable
especially
when
his
attitude
towards
her
approaches
the
machiavellian
i
could
only
murmur
modestly
that
i
hoped
i
could
claim
these
qualifications
and
you
do
think
me
a
dreadful
woman
so
far
from
it
madame
brandt
i
replied
that
i
think
you
a
remarkable
i
wonder
if
i
am
she
said
sinking
back
among
her
cushions
i
should
like
to
be
for
dale
sake
i
suppose
you
know
i
care
a
great
deal
for
dale
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
guessing
it
said
i
and
since
you
have
done
me
the
honour
of
taking
me
so
far
into
your
confidence
i
added
playing
what
i
considered
to
be
my
may
i
venture
to
ask
whether
you
have
contemplated
i
paused
marriage
her
brow
grew
dark
as
she
looked
involuntarily
at
her
bare
left
hand
i
have
got
a
husband
already
she
replied
as
i
expected
ladies
like
lola
brandt
always
have
husbands
unfit
for
publication
and
as
the
latter
seem
to
make
it
a
point
of
honour
never
to
die
widowed
lolas
are
as
rare
as
blackberries
in
spring
forgive
my
rudeness
i
said
but
you
wear
no
wedding
i
threw
it
into
the
ah
said
i
do
you
want
to
hear
about
him
she
asked
suddenly
if
we
are
to
be
friends
perhaps
you
had
better
know
somehow
i
do
like
talking
to
dale
about
it
do
you
mind
putting
some
coals
on
the
fire
i
busied
myself
with
the
lit
a
cigarette
and
settled
down
to
hear
the
story
if
it
had
not
been
told
in
the
twilight
hour
by
a
woman
with
a
caressing
enveloping
voice
like
lola
brandt
i
should
have
yawned
myself
out
of
the
house
it
was
a
dismal
ordinary
story
her
husband
was
a
gentleman
a
captain
vauvenarde
in
the
french
army
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
when
she
had
first
taken
marseilles
captive
with
the
prodigiosities
of
her
horse
sultan
his
proposals
of
manifold
unsanctified
delights
met
with
unqualified
rejection
by
the
respectable
and
not
too
passionately
infatuated
lola
when
he
nerved
himself
to
the
supreme
sacrifice
of
offering
marriage
she
accepted
she
had
dreams
of
social
advancement
yearned
to
be
one
of
the
white
faces
of
the
audience
in
the
front
rows
the
civil
ceremony
having
been
performed
he
pleaded
with
her
for
a
few
weeks
secrecy
on
account
of
his
family
the
weeks
grew
into
months
during
which
for
the
sake
of
a
livelihood
she
fulfilled
her
professional
engagements
in
many
other
towns
at
last
when
she
returned
to
marseilles
it
became
apparent
that
captain
vauvenarde
had
no
intention
whatever
of
acknowledging
her
openly
as
his
wife
hence
many
tears
moreover
he
had
little
beyond
his
pay
and
his
gambling
debts
instead
of
the
comfortable
little
fortune
that
would
have
assured
her
social
position
now
officers
in
the
french
army
who
marry
ladies
with
performing
horses
are
not
usually
guided
by
reason
and
captain
vauvenarde
seems
to
have
been
the
most
unreasonable
being
in
the
world
it
was
beneath
the
dignity
of
captain
wife
to
make
a
horse
do
tricks
in
public
and
it
was
beneath
captain
vauvenarde
dignity
to
give
her
his
name
before
the
world
she
must
neither
be
lola
brandt
nor
madame
vauvenarde
she
must
give
up
her
fairly
lucrative
profession
and
live
in
obscurity
up
a
little
back
street
on
an
allowance
of
a
week
and
be
happy
and
cheerful
and
devoted
lola
refused
hence
more
tears
there
were
scenes
of
frantic
jealousy
not
on
account
of
any
human
being
but
on
account
of
the
horse
if
she
loved
him
as
much
as
she
loved
that
abominable
quadruped
whose
artificial
airs
and
graces
made
him
sick
every
time
he
looked
at
it
she
would
accede
to
his
desire
besides
he
had
the
husband
right
a
powerful
privilege
in
france
she
pointed
out
that
he
could
only
exercise
it
by
declaring
her
to
be
his
wife
relations
were
strained
they
led
separate
lives
from
marseilles
she
went
to
genoa
whither
he
followed
her
eventually
he
went
away
in
a
temper
and
never
came
back
she
had
not
heard
from
him
since
and
where
he
was
at
the
present
moment
she
had
not
the
faintest
idea
so
you
went
cheerfully
on
with
your
profession
i
remarked
i
returned
to
marseilles
and
there
i
lost
my
horse
sultan
then
my
father
died
and
left
me
pretty
well
off
and
i
had
the
heart
to
train
another
animal
so
here
i
am
ah
with
one
of
her
lithe
movements
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
flinging
out
her
arms
in
a
wide
gesture
began
to
walk
about
the
room
stopping
here
and
there
to
turn
on
the
light
and
draw
the
flaring
chintz
curtains
i
rose
too
so
as
to
aid
her
suddenly
as
we
met
by
the
window
she
laid
both
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
into
my
face
earnestly
and
imploringly
and
her
lips
quivered
i
wondered
apprehensively
what
she
was
going
to
do
next
for
god
sake
be
my
friend
and
help
me
the
cry
in
her
rich
low
notes
seemed
to
come
from
the
depths
of
the
woman
nature
it
caused
some
absurd
and
unnecessary
chord
within
me
to
vibrate
for
the
first
time
i
realised
that
her
strong
handsome
face
could
look
nobly
and
pathetically
beautiful
her
eyes
swam
in
an
adorable
moisture
and
grew
very
human
and
appealing
in
a
second
all
my
ordinances
were
forgotten
the
witch
had
me
in
her
power
again
my
dear
madame
brandt
said
i
how
can
i
do
it
do
take
dale
from
me
i
lived
alone
alone
alone
all
these
years
and
i
could
bear
do
you
care
for
him
so
very
much
she
withdrew
her
hands
and
moved
slightly
who
else
in
the
wide
world
have
i
to
care
for
this
was
very
pathetic
but
i
had
the
sense
to
remark
that
compromising
the
boy
future
was
not
the
best
way
of
showing
her
devotion
oh
how
could
i
do
that
she
asked
i
ca
marry
him
and
if
i
do
what
i
never
done
before
for
any
man
become
his
mistress
who
need
know
i
could
stay
in
the
you
seem
to
forget
dear
lady
said
i
that
captain
vauvenarde
is
probably
but
i
tell
you
i
lost
sight
of
him
are
you
quite
so
sure
i
asked
regaining
my
sanity
by
degrees
that
captain
vauvenarde
has
lost
sight
of
you
she
turned
quickly
what
do
you
mean
you
have
given
him
no
chance
as
yet
of
recovering
his
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
do
you
mean
divorce
it
an
ugly
word
dear
madame
brandt
said
i
as
gently
as
i
could
but
you
and
i
are
strong
people
and
need
fear
uttering
it
you
think
such
a
scandal
would
ruin
dale
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
career
there
was
a
short
silence
i
was
glad
to
see
she
was
feminine
enough
to
twist
and
tear
her
handkerchief
what
am
i
to
do
she
asked
at
last
i
ca
live
this
awful
lonely
life
much
longer
sometimes
i
get
the
i
might
have
given
her
the
sound
advice
to
find
healthy
occupation
in
training
crocodiles
to
sit
up
and
beg
but
an
idea
which
advanced
thinkers
might
classify
as
more
suburban
was
beginning
to
take
shape
in
my
mind
has
it
occurred
to
you
i
said
that
now
you
have
assumed
the
qualifications
imposed
by
captain
vauvenarde
for
bearing
his
name
i
do
you
no
longer
perform
in
public
he
would
have
no
possible
grievance
against
are
you
suggesting
that
i
should
go
back
to
my
husband
she
gasped
i
am
said
i
feeling
mighty
diplomatic
she
looked
straight
in
front
of
her
with
parted
lips
fingering
her
handkerchief
and
evidently
pondering
the
entirely
new
suggestion
i
thought
it
best
to
let
her
ponder
as
a
general
rule
people
will
do
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
think
so
when
one
sees
a
human
being
wrapped
in
thought
one
ought
to
regard
wilful
disturbance
of
the
process
as
sacrilege
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
wandered
about
the
room
eventually
i
came
to
a
standstill
before
the
venus
of
milo
but
while
i
was
admiring
its
calm
mysterious
beauty
the
development
of
a
former
idea
took
the
shape
of
an
inspiration
which
made
my
heart
sing
fate
had
put
into
my
hands
the
chance
of
complete
eumoiriety
if
i
could
effect
a
reconciliation
between
lola
brandt
and
her
husband
dale
would
be
cured
almost
automatically
of
his
infatuation
and
i
should
be
the
deputy
providence
bringing
happiness
to
six
human
beings
lola
brandt
captain
vauvenarde
lady
kynnersley
maisie
ellerton
dale
and
anastasius
papadopoulos
who
could
not
fail
to
be
delighted
at
the
happiness
of
his
goddess
there
also
might
burst
joyously
on
the
earth
a
brood
of
gleeful
little
vauvenardes
and
merry
little
kynnersleys
who
might
regard
simon
de
gex
as
their
mythical
progenitor
it
might
add
to
the
gaiety
of
regiments
and
the
edification
of
parliaments
acts
should
be
judged
thought
i
not
according
to
their
trivial
essence
but
by
the
light
of
their
consequences
lola
brandt
broke
the
silence
she
did
not
look
at
me
she
said
i
ca
help
feeling
that
you
my
i
am
i
cried
in
the
exultation
of
my
promotion
to
the
role
of
deputy
providence
i
am
indeed
and
a
most
devoted
will
you
let
me
think
over
what
you
said
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
come
for
an
answer
willingly
said
i
and
you
wo
what
no
i
know
you
tell
dale
i
said
guessing
no
of
course
she
rose
and
put
out
both
her
hands
to
me
in
a
very
noble
gesture
i
took
them
and
kissed
one
of
them
she
looked
at
me
with
parted
lips
you
are
the
best
man
i
have
ever
met
she
said
at
the
moment
of
her
saying
it
i
believed
it
such
conviction
is
induced
by
the
utterances
of
this
singular
woman
but
when
i
got
outside
the
door
my
natural
modesty
revolted
i
slapped
my
thigh
impatiently
with
what
i
thought
were
my
gloves
they
made
so
little
sound
that
i
found
there
was
only
one
i
had
left
the
other
inside
i
entered
and
found
lola
brandt
in
front
of
the
fire
holding
my
glove
in
her
hand
she
started
in
some
confusion
is
this
yours
she
asked
now
whose
could
it
have
been
but
mine
the
ridiculous
question
worried
me
off
and
on
all
the
evening
chapter
vii
the
murder
is
out
a
paragraph
has
appeared
in
the
newspapers
to
the
effect
that
the
marriage
arranged
between
simon
de
gex
and
miss
eleanor
faversham
will
not
take
place
it
has
also
become
common
knowledge
that
i
am
resigning
my
seat
in
parliament
on
account
of
that
is
the
reason
rightly
assigned
by
my
acquaintances
for
the
rupture
of
my
engagement
i
am
being
rapidly
killed
by
the
doleful
kindness
of
my
friends
they
are
so
dismally
sympathetic
everywhere
i
go
there
are
long
faces
and
solemn
in
order
to
cheer
myself
i
gave
a
little
at
the
club
and
the
function
might
have
been
a
depressed
wake
with
my
corpse
in
a
coffin
on
the
table
my
sisters
dear
kind
souls
follow
me
with
anxious
eyes
as
if
i
were
one
of
their
children
sickening
for
they
upbraid
me
for
leaving
them
in
ignorance
and
in
hushed
voices
inquire
as
to
my
symptoms
they
both
came
this
morning
to
the
albany
to
see
what
they
could
do
for
me
i
do
see
what
they
can
do
save
help
rogers
put
studs
in
my
shirts
they
expressed
such
affectionate
concern
that
at
last
i
cried
out
my
dear
girls
if
you
do
smile
i
sit
upon
the
hearthrug
and
howl
like
a
then
they
exchanged
glances
and
broke
into
hectic
gaiety
dear
things
under
the
impression
that
they
were
brightening
me
up
i
am
being
deluged
with
letters
i
had
no
idea
i
was
such
a
popular
person
they
come
from
high
placed
and
lowly
from
constituents
whom
my
base
and
servile
flattery
have
turned
into
friends
from
members
of
parliament
from
dowagers
and
from
little
girls
who
have
inveigled
me
out
to
lunch
for
the
purpose
of
confiding
to
me
their
love
affairs
i
could
set
up
as
a
general
practitioner
of
medicine
on
the
advice
that
is
given
me
i
am
recommended
oil
lung
tonic
electric
massage
abdominal
belts
warm
water
mud
baths
sandow
treatment
and
every
patent
medicament
save
rat
poison
i
am
urged
to
go
to
health
resorts
ranging
geographically
from
the
top
of
the
jungfrau
to
central
africa
all
kinds
of
worthy
persons
have
offered
to
nurse
me
old
general
wynans
writes
me
a
letter
to
assure
me
that
i
have
only
to
go
to
his
friend
eustace
adams
of
wimpole
street
to
be
cured
like
a
shot
i
happen
to
know
that
eustace
adams
is
an
eminent
gynecologist
and
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
these
effusions
written
in
the
milk
of
human
kindness
have
to
be
answered
dale
is
not
here
i
have
to
sit
down
at
my
desk
and
toil
like
a
galley
slave
i
am
being
worn
to
a
shadow
lola
brandt
too
has
heard
the
news
dale
in
berlin
and
the
london
newspapers
being
her
informants
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
when
i
called
to
learn
her
decision
why
had
i
not
told
her
i
was
so
ill
why
had
i
let
her
worry
me
with
her
silly
troubles
why
had
i
not
consulted
her
friend
sir
joshua
oldfield
she
filled
up
my
chair
with
cushions
which
like
most
men
i
find
stuffy
and
comfortless
and
if
i
had
given
her
the
slightest
encouragement
would
have
stuck
my
feet
in
hot
mustard
and
water
why
had
i
come
out
on
such
a
dreadful
day
it
was
indeed
a
detestable
day
of
raw
fog
she
pulled
the
curtains
close
and
insisting
upon
my
remaining
among
my
cushions
piled
the
grate
with
coal
up
the
chimney
would
i
like
some
eucalyptus
my
dear
madame
brandt
i
cried
my
bronchial
tubes
and
lungs
are
as
strong
as
a
i
wish
every
one
would
not
conclude
that
i
was
going
off
in
a
rapid
decline
lola
brandt
prowled
about
me
in
a
wistful
mothering
way
showing
me
a
fresh
side
of
her
nature
she
is
as
domesticated
as
penelope
you
fond
of
cooking
are
you
i
asked
suddenly
she
laughed
i
adore
it
how
do
you
know
i
guessed
said
i
i
what
the
french
call
a
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
i
are
you
i
thought
your
class
hated
the
the
i
said
is
the
nation
granary
of
the
virtues
but
for
god
sake
do
tell
any
one
that
i
said
so
why
she
asked
if
it
found
its
way
into
print
it
would
ruin
my
reputation
for
she
drew
a
step
or
two
towards
me
in
her
slow
rhythmic
way
and
smiled
when
you
say
or
do
a
beautiful
thing
you
always
try
to
bite
off
its
then
she
turned
and
drew
some
needlework
plain
sewing
i
believe
they
call
it
from
beneath
the
union
jack
cushion
and
sat
down
i
make
a
confession
she
said
until
now
i
stuffed
away
my
work
when
i
heard
you
coming
i
did
think
it
genteel
what
do
you
think
i
scanned
the
shapeless
mass
of
linen
or
tulle
or
whatever
it
was
on
her
lap
i
do
know
whether
it
genteel
i
remarked
but
at
present
it
looks
like
nothing
on
god
my
masculine
ignorance
of
such
mysteries
made
her
laugh
she
is
readily
moved
to
mild
mirth
which
makes
her
an
easy
companion
besides
little
jokes
are
made
to
be
laughed
at
and
i
like
women
who
laugh
at
them
there
was
a
brief
silence
i
smoked
and
made
adolphus
stand
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
balance
sugar
on
his
nose
his
mistress
sewed
presently
she
said
without
looking
up
from
her
work
i
made
up
my
i
rose
from
my
cushioned
seat
into
which
adolphus
evidently
thinking
me
a
fool
immediately
snuggled
himself
and
i
stood
facing
her
with
my
back
to
the
fire
well
said
i
i
am
ready
to
go
back
to
my
husband
if
he
can
be
found
and
of
course
if
he
will
have
i
commended
her
for
a
brave
women
she
smiled
rather
sadly
and
shook
her
head
those
are
two
gigantic
giants
before
now
have
been
slain
by
the
valiant
i
replied
how
is
captain
vauvenarde
to
be
found
an
officer
in
the
french
army
is
not
like
a
lost
sparrow
in
london
his
whereabouts
could
be
obtained
from
the
french
war
office
what
is
his
regiment
the
chasseurs
yes
she
added
thoughtfully
i
see
it
difficult
to
trace
him
i
make
one
condition
however
you
ca
refuse
what
is
that
until
things
are
fixed
up
everything
must
go
on
just
as
at
present
between
dale
and
me
he
is
not
to
be
told
anything
if
nothing
comes
of
it
then
i
have
him
all
to
myself
i
wo
give
him
up
and
be
left
alone
as
long
as
i
care
for
him
i
swear
to
god
i
wo
she
said
in
her
low
rich
voice
and
i
saw
by
her
face
that
she
was
a
woman
of
her
word
besides
he
would
come
raving
and
imploring
and
i
not
quite
a
woman
of
stone
it
is
all
jam
to
go
back
to
my
husband
goodness
knows
why
i
am
thinking
of
it
it
for
your
sake
do
you
know
that
i
did
not
i
was
puzzled
why
in
the
world
should
lola
brandt
whom
i
have
only
met
three
or
four
times
revolutionise
the
whole
of
her
life
for
my
sake
i
should
have
thought
it
was
for
dale
said
i
i
suppose
you
would
being
a
man
she
replied
i
retorted
with
a
smile
woman
is
the
eternal
conundrum
to
which
the
wise
man
always
leaves
her
herself
to
supply
the
answer
doubtless
one
of
these
days
you
do
it
meanwhile
i
wait
in
she
gave
me
one
of
her
sidelong
flashing
glances
and
sewed
with
more
vigour
than
appeared
necessary
i
admired
the
beautiful
curves
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
as
she
bent
over
her
work
she
seemed
too
strong
to
wield
such
an
insignificant
weapon
as
a
needle
that
neither
here
nor
there
she
said
in
reference
to
my
last
remark
i
say
i
do
look
forward
to
going
back
to
my
husband
though
why
i
should
say
back
i
do
know
as
he
left
me
not
i
him
anyhow
i
ready
to
do
it
if
it
can
be
managed
i
cut
myself
adrift
suddenly
from
dale
it
will
be
more
merciful
to
him
a
man
can
bear
a
sudden
blow
better
than
lingering
pain
if
it
ca
be
managed
well
dale
will
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
and
both
he
and
i
will
be
saved
a
mortal
deal
of
worry
and
suppose
said
i
it
ca
be
managed
do
you
propose
to
keep
dale
ignorant
of
the
danger
he
is
running
in
keeping
up
a
liaison
with
a
married
woman
living
apart
from
her
husband
she
reflected
if
my
husband
says
he
see
me
damned
first
before
he
come
back
to
me
then
i
tell
dale
everything
and
you
can
say
what
you
like
to
him
he
be
able
to
judge
for
himself
but
in
the
meanwhile
you
let
me
have
what
happiness
i
i
accepted
the
compromise
and
dispossessing
adolphus
sat
down
again
i
certainly
had
made
progress
feeling
in
a
benevolent
mood
i
set
forth
the
advantages
she
would
reap
by
assuming
her
legal
status
how
at
last
she
would
shake
the
dust
of
bohemia
from
off
her
feet
and
instead
of
standing
at
the
threshold
like
a
disconsolate
peri
she
would
enter
as
a
right
the
paradise
of
philistia
which
she
craved
how
her
life
would
be
one
continual
and
how
as
her
husband
had
doubtless
by
this
time
obtained
his
promotion
she
would
be
authorised
to
adopt
high
and
mighty
airs
in
her
relations
with
the
wives
of
all
the
captains
and
lieutenants
in
the
regiment
she
sighed
and
wondered
whether
she
would
like
it
after
all
here
in
england
i
can
say
as
often
as
i
choose
i
do
say
it
very
often
but
sometimes
i
feel
i
must
say
it
or
there
are
its
equivalents
in
french
i
suggested
she
laughed
outright
fancy
my
coming
out
with
a
nom
de
in
a
french
fancy
you
shouting
in
an
english
that
true
she
said
i
suppose
are
the
same
all
the
world
over
i
do
try
to
talk
like
a
lady
at
least
what
i
imagine
they
talk
like
for
i
never
met
you
see
one
every
time
you
look
in
the
glass
said
i
her
olive
face
flushed
you
must
say
such
things
to
me
if
you
mean
them
i
like
to
think
all
you
say
to
me
is
why
in
the
world
i
cried
should
you
not
be
a
lady
you
have
the
instincts
of
one
how
many
of
my
fair
friends
in
mayfair
and
belgravia
would
have
made
their
unspeakable
just
for
the
sake
of
not
hurting
the
feelings
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
she
put
aside
her
work
and
leaning
over
the
arm
of
the
chair
her
chin
in
her
hands
looked
at
me
gratefully
i
so
glad
you
said
that
dale
ca
understand
it
he
wants
me
to
clear
the
trash
dale
said
i
is
young
and
impetuous
i
am
a
battered
old
philosopher
with
one
foot
in
the
quick
moisture
gathered
in
her
eyes
you
hurt
me
she
said
soon
get
well
and
strong
again
you
must
que
femme
veut
dieu
le
i
laughed
bien
je
le
she
said
with
an
odd
expression
in
her
eyes
which
burned
golden
they
fascinated
me
held
mine
for
some
seconds
neither
of
us
moved
just
consider
the
picture
there
among
the
cushions
of
her
chair
she
sprawled
beneath
the
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
on
the
further
side
and
in
front
of
the
leaping
flames
a
great
powerful
sinuous
creature
of
sweeping
curves
clad
in
a
clinging
brown
dress
her
head
crowned
with
superb
bronze
hair
two
warm
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
at
which
the
sleeve
ended
in
lace
falling
over
the
side
of
the
chair
and
her
leopard
eyes
fixed
on
me
about
her
still
hung
the
echo
of
her
last
words
spoken
in
deep
tones
whose
register
belongs
less
to
human
habitations
than
to
the
jungle
and
from
her
emanated
like
a
captivating
odour
but
it
was
not
an
odour
a
strange
magnetic
influence
i
have
done
my
best
to
write
her
down
in
my
mind
a
commonplace
vulgar
mountebank
but
i
can
do
so
no
longer
there
is
something
deep
down
in
the
soul
of
lola
brandt
which
sets
her
apart
from
the
kindly
race
of
womankind
whether
it
is
the
devil
or
a
touch
of
splendour
or
an
ancestral
catamount
i
make
no
attempt
to
determine
at
any
rate
she
is
too
grand
a
creature
to
fritter
her
life
away
on
a
and
young
briton
like
dale
kynnersley
he
would
never
begin
to
understand
her
i
will
save
her
from
dale
for
her
own
sake
all
this
ladies
and
gentlemen
because
her
eyes
fascinated
me
and
caused
me
to
hold
my
breath
and
made
my
heart
beat
and
will
captain
vauvenarde
understand
her
of
course
he
wo
but
then
he
is
her
husband
and
husbands
are
notoriously
and
i
make
no
pretensions
to
understand
her
but
as
i
am
neither
her
lover
nor
her
husband
it
does
not
matter
she
says
nothing
diabolical
or
eerie
or
fantastic
or
feline
or
or
uncanny
or
spiritual
and
yet
she
in
a
queer
indescribable
way
all
these
things
le
she
said
and
we
drank
in
each
other
souls
or
gaped
at
each
other
like
a
pair
of
idiots
just
as
you
please
i
had
a
horrible
yet
pleasurable
consciousness
that
she
had
gripped
hold
of
my
nerves
of
volition
she
was
willing
me
to
live
i
was
a
puppet
in
her
hands
like
the
wild
at
that
moment
i
declare
i
could
have
purred
and
rubbed
my
head
against
her
knee
i
would
have
done
anything
she
bade
me
if
she
had
sent
me
to
fetch
the
cham
of
tartary
cap
or
a
hair
of
the
prester
john
beard
i
would
have
telephoned
forthwith
to
rogers
to
pack
a
and
book
a
seat
in
the
orient
express
what
would
have
happened
next
heaven
alone
knows
for
we
could
not
have
gone
on
gazing
at
each
other
until
i
backed
myself
out
at
the
door
by
way
of
had
not
anticlimax
arrived
in
the
person
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
in
his
eternal
but
his
gloves
were
black
as
usual
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
kissed
his
lady
hand
then
he
rose
and
greeted
me
with
solemn
affability
un
privilege
de
rencontrer
den
gnadigsten
said
he
confining
myself
to
one
language
i
responded
by
informing
him
that
it
was
an
honour
always
to
meet
so
renowned
a
professor
and
inquired
politely
after
the
health
of
hephaestus
ah
signore
he
cried
do
not
ask
me
it
is
a
tragedy
from
which
i
shall
never
he
sat
down
on
a
footstool
by
the
side
of
madame
brandt
and
burst
into
tears
which
coursed
down
his
cheeks
and
moustache
and
hung
like
drops
of
dew
from
the
point
of
his
imperial
is
he
dead
asked
madame
i
wish
he
were
no
it
is
only
the
iron
that
i
possess
which
prevented
me
from
slaying
him
on
the
spot
but
poor
santa
bianca
my
gentle
and
accomplished
angora
he
has
killed
her
i
can
scarcely
raise
my
head
through
lola
put
her
great
arm
round
the
little
man
neck
and
patted
him
like
a
child
while
he
sobbed
as
if
his
heart
would
break
when
he
recovered
he
gave
us
the
details
of
the
tragic
end
of
santa
bianca
and
wound
up
by
calling
down
the
most
ingeniously
complicated
and
passionate
curses
on
the
head
of
the
murderer
lola
brandt
strove
to
pacify
him
we
all
have
our
sorrows
anastasius
did
i
not
lose
my
beautiful
horse
sultan
the
professor
sprang
to
his
full
height
of
four
feet
and
dashed
away
his
tears
with
a
noble
gesture
of
his
hand
base
slave
that
he
was
to
think
of
his
own
petty
bereavement
in
the
face
of
her
eternal
affliction
he
turned
to
me
and
bade
me
mark
her
serene
nobility
it
was
a
model
and
an
example
for
him
to
follow
he
too
would
be
brave
and
present
a
smiling
face
to
evil
fortune
behold
i
smile
carissima
he
cried
dramatically
we
beheld
and
saw
his
features
smudged
with
tearstains
and
the
dye
from
the
black
gloves
which
he
obviously
wore
out
of
respect
for
the
deceased
santa
bianca
contorted
into
a
grimace
of
hideous
imbecility
monsieur
said
he
assuming
his
natural
expression
which
was
one
of
pensive
melancholy
let
us
change
the
conversation
you
are
a
great
statesman
will
you
kindly
let
me
know
your
opinion
on
the
foreign
policy
of
germany
whereupon
he
sat
down
again
upon
his
stool
and
regarded
me
with
earnest
attention
germany
said
i
with
the
solemnity
of
a
sir
oracle
in
the
of
one
of
the
political
clubs
has
dreams
of
an
empire
beyond
her
frontiers
and
with
a
view
to
converting
the
dream
into
a
reality
is
turning
out
battleships
nineteen
to
the
the
professor
nodded
his
head
sagaciously
and
looked
up
at
lola
very
profound
said
he
very
profound
i
shall
remember
it
i
am
a
greek
monsieur
and
the
greeks
as
you
know
are
a
nation
of
ever
since
the
days
of
xenophon
said
i
you
both
too
clever
for
me
exclaimed
our
hostess
where
did
you
get
your
knowledge
from
anastasius
the
professor
flattered
passed
his
hand
over
his
bulgy
forehead
i
was
a
great
student
in
my
youth
said
he
once
i
could
tell
you
all
the
kings
of
rome
and
the
date
of
the
battle
of
actium
but
pressure
of
weightier
concerns
has
driven
my
erudition
from
me
pardon
me
i
have
not
yet
asked
after
your
health
you
are
looking
sad
and
troubled
what
is
the
matter
he
sat
bolt
upright
fingering
his
imperial
and
regarding
her
with
the
keen
solicitude
of
a
family
physician
to
my
amazement
lola
brandt
told
him
quite
simply
i
am
thinking
of
living
with
my
husband
has
the
traitor
been
annoying
you
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
fierceness
oh
no
it
my
own
idea
i
tired
of
living
alone
i
do
even
know
where
he
do
you
want
to
know
where
he
is
how
can
i
communicate
with
him
unless
i
do
anastasius
papadopoulos
rose
struck
an
attitude
and
thumped
his
breast
i
will
seek
him
for
you
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
will
bring
him
to
prostrate
himself
at
your
that
very
kind
of
you
anastasius
said
lola
gently
but
what
will
become
of
your
cats
the
dwarf
raised
his
hand
impressively
the
almighty
will
have
them
in
his
keeping
i
have
also
my
pupil
and
assistant
lola
smiled
indulgently
from
her
cushions
showing
her
curious
even
teeth
you
must
do
anything
so
mad
anastasius
i
forbid
madame
said
he
in
a
most
stately
manner
when
i
devote
myself
it
is
to
the
death
i
have
the
honour
to
salute
you
he
bowed
over
her
hand
and
kissed
it
he
bowed
to
me
with
the
profundity
of
a
hidalgo
and
trotted
magnificently
out
of
the
room
it
was
all
so
sudden
that
it
took
my
breath
away
well
i
i
did
know
what
i
was
so
i
stopped
lola
brandt
broke
into
low
laughter
at
my
astonishment
that
anastasius
way
she
explained
but
the
little
man
surely
is
going
to
leave
his
cats
and
start
on
a
chase
over
europe
to
find
your
husband
he
thinks
he
is
but
i
sha
let
i
hope
you
wo
said
i
and
will
you
tell
me
why
you
made
so
a
person
your
confidant
i
confess
that
i
was
wrathful
here
had
i
been
using
the
wiles
of
a
balkan
chancery
to
bring
the
lady
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
here
was
she
to
my
face
making
a
joke
of
it
with
this
caricature
of
a
paladin
my
dearest
friend
she
replied
earnestly
do
be
angry
with
me
i
given
the
poor
little
man
something
to
think
of
besides
the
death
of
his
cat
it
will
do
him
good
and
why
should
i
tell
him
he
a
dear
old
friend
and
in
his
way
was
so
good
to
me
when
i
was
unhappy
he
knows
all
about
my
married
life
you
may
think
he
but
he
is
in
ordinary
business
dealings
he
as
shrewd
as
they
make
the
manager
who
beats
anastasius
over
a
contract
is
yet
to
be
by
some
extraordinary
process
of
the
contortionist
art
she
curled
herself
out
of
her
chair
on
to
the
hearthrug
and
knelt
before
me
her
hands
clasped
on
my
knee
you
not
angry
with
me
are
you
she
asked
in
her
rich
contralto
i
took
both
her
hands
rose
and
assisted
her
to
rise
i
was
not
going
to
be
mesmerised
again
of
course
not
i
laughed
indeed
my
wrath
had
fallen
from
me
her
bosom
heaved
with
a
sigh
i
so
glad
she
said
her
breath
fanned
my
cheek
it
was
aromatic
intoxicating
her
lips
are
ripe
and
full
you
had
better
find
your
husband
as
soon
as
possible
said
i
do
you
think
so
she
asked
yes
i
do
and
it
strikes
me
i
had
better
go
and
find
him
she
started
you
yes
i
said
the
chasseurs
are
probably
in
africa
and
the
doctors
have
ordered
me
to
winter
in
a
hot
climate
and
i
shall
go
on
writing
a
million
letters
a
day
if
i
stay
here
which
will
kill
me
off
in
no
time
with
brain
fag
and
writer
cramp
your
husband
will
be
what
the
newspapers
call
an
objective
said
i
i
bring
him
to
you
dead
or
and
without
knowing
it
at
the
time
i
made
an
exit
as
magnificent
as
that
of
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
chapter
viii
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
laugh
or
rail
judged
by
the
ordinary
canons
that
regulate
the
respectable
life
to
which
i
have
been
accustomed
i
am
little
short
of
a
lunatic
the
question
is
does
the
recognition
of
lunacy
in
oneself
tend
to
amusement
or
anger
i
compromise
with
myself
i
am
angry
at
having
been
forced
on
an
insane
adventure
but
the
prospect
of
its
absurdity
gives
me
a
considerable
pleasure
let
me
set
it
down
once
and
for
all
i
resent
lola
brandt
existence
when
i
am
out
of
her
company
i
can
contemplate
her
calmly
from
my
vantage
of
social
and
intellectual
superiority
i
can
her
fascinations
i
can
crack
jokes
on
her
shortcomings
i
can
see
perfectly
well
that
i
am
simon
de
gex
i
have
not
yet
been
appointed
to
the
stewardship
of
the
chiltern
hundreds
of
eton
and
trinity
college
cambridge
a
barrister
of
the
inner
temple
though
a
brief
would
cause
me
as
much
dismay
as
a
command
to
conduct
the
orchestra
at
covent
garden
formerly
of
the
foreign
office
a
man
of
the
world
a
a
hardened
jester
at
feminine
wiles
a
cynical
student
of
philosophy
a
man
of
birth
and
i
believe
breeding
with
a
cultivated
taste
in
wine
and
food
and
furniture
one
also
who
but
for
a
little
pain
inside
would
soon
become
a
member
of
his
majesty
government
and
eventually
drop
the
esquire
at
the
end
of
his
name
and
stick
the
right
honourable
in
front
of
it
in
fact
a
most
superior
wise
and
important
person
and
i
can
also
see
perfectly
well
that
lola
brandt
is
an
uneducated
lowly
bred
vagabond
female
with
a
taste
as
i
have
remarked
before
for
wild
beasts
and
with
whom
i
have
as
much
in
common
as
i
have
with
the
feathered
lady
on
a
or
the
fat
woman
at
the
fair
i
can
see
all
this
perfectly
well
in
the
calm
seclusion
of
my
library
but
when
i
am
in
her
presence
my
superiority
like
bob
acres
valour
oozes
out
through
my
i
become
a
besotted
idiot
the
sense
and
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
her
overpower
me
i
proclaim
her
rich
and
remarkable
personality
and
i
bask
in
her
lazy
smiles
like
any
silly
undergraduate
whose
knowledge
of
women
has
hitherto
been
limited
to
his
sisters
and
the
common
little
girl
at
the
tobacconist
i
say
i
resent
it
i
resent
the
low
notes
in
her
voice
i
resent
the
cajolery
of
the
supple
twists
of
her
body
i
resent
her
putting
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
as
the
poets
say
fanning
my
cheek
with
her
breath
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
i
should
never
have
promised
to
go
in
search
of
her
impossible
husband
at
any
rate
it
is
easy
to
discover
his
whereabouts
a
french
bookseller
has
telegraphed
to
paris
for
the
officiel
de
the
french
army
list
it
locates
every
officer
in
the
french
army
and
as
the
chasseurs
generally
chase
in
africa
it
will
tell
me
the
station
in
algeria
or
tunisia
which
captain
vauvenarde
adorns
i
can
go
straight
to
him
as
madame
brandt
plenipotentiary
and
if
the
unreasonable
and
warrior
does
not
run
me
through
the
body
for
impertinence
before
he
has
time
to
appreciate
the
delicacy
of
my
mission
i
may
be
able
to
convince
him
that
a
wife
is
worth
the
respectable
consideration
of
a
captain
of
chasseurs
i
say
i
may
be
able
to
convince
him
but
i
shrink
from
the
impudence
of
the
encounter
i
am
to
accost
a
total
stranger
in
a
foreign
army
and
tell
him
to
return
to
his
wife
this
is
the
pretty
little
mission
i
have
undertaken
it
sounded
glorious
and
eumoirous
and
quixotic
and
deucedly
funny
during
the
noble
moment
of
inspiration
when
lola
golden
eyes
were
upon
me
but
now
well
i
shall
have
to
persuade
myself
that
it
is
funny
if
i
am
to
carry
it
out
it
is
very
much
like
wagering
that
one
will
tweak
by
the
nose
the
first
gentleman
in
gaiters
and
one
meets
in
piccadilly
this
by
some
is
considered
the
quintessence
of
comedy
i
foresee
a
revision
of
my
sense
of
humour
this
afternoon
i
met
lady
kynnersley
again
at
the
ellertons
i
was
talking
to
maisie
who
has
grown
no
happier
when
i
saw
her
sailing
across
to
me
with
questions
hoisted
in
her
eyes
being
particularly
desirous
not
to
report
progress
periodically
to
lady
kynnersley
i
made
a
desperate
move
i
went
forward
and
greeted
her
lady
kynnersley
said
i
somebody
was
telling
me
that
you
are
in
urgent
need
of
funds
for
something
with
my
usual
i
have
forgotten
what
it
is
but
i
know
it
is
a
deserving
the
philanthropist
as
i
hoped
ousted
the
mother
she
exclaimed
at
once
it
must
have
been
the
cabmen
and
omnibus
drivers
rheumatic
that
was
it
said
i
hearing
of
the
institution
for
the
first
time
they
are
martyrs
to
rheumatic
gout
and
of
course
have
no
means
of
obtaining
proper
treatment
so
we
have
secured
a
site
at
harrogate
and
are
building
a
comfortable
place
half
hospital
half
hotel
where
they
can
be
put
up
for
a
shilling
a
day
and
have
all
the
benefits
of
the
waters
just
as
if
they
were
staying
at
the
hotel
majestic
do
you
want
to
become
a
subscriber
i
am
eager
to
said
i
then
come
over
here
and
i
tell
you
all
about
i
sat
with
her
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
listened
to
her
she
wrung
my
heart
to
such
a
pitch
of
sympathy
that
i
rose
and
grasped
her
by
the
hand
it
is
indeed
a
noble
project
i
cried
i
love
the
london
cabby
as
my
brother
and
i
post
you
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
this
evening
i
left
her
in
a
state
of
joyous
stupefaction
and
made
my
escape
if
it
had
not
fallen
in
with
my
general
scheme
of
good
works
i
should
regard
it
as
an
expensive
method
of
avoiding
unpleasant
questions
another
philanthropist
by
the
way
of
quite
a
different
type
from
lady
kynnersley
who
has
lately
benefited
by
my
eleemosynary
mania
is
rex
campion
i
have
known
him
since
our
university
days
and
have
maintained
a
sincere
though
desultory
friendship
with
him
ever
since
he
is
also
a
friend
of
eleanor
faversham
whom
he
now
and
then
inveigles
into
weird
doings
in
the
impossible
slums
of
south
lambeth
he
has
tried
on
many
occasions
to
lure
me
into
his
web
but
hitherto
i
have
resisted
being
the
possessor
of
a
large
fortune
he
has
been
able
to
gratify
a
devouring
passion
for
philanthropy
and
has
squandered
most
of
his
money
on
an
institution
a
kind
of
club
school
dispensary
all
rolled
into
one
in
lambeth
and
there
he
lives
himself
perfectly
happy
among
a
hungry
grubby
scarecrow
tatterdemalion
crowd
at
a
loss
for
a
defining
name
he
has
called
it
barbara
building
after
his
mother
his
conception
of
the
cosmos
is
that
sun
moon
and
stars
revolve
round
barbara
building
how
he
learned
that
i
was
so
to
speak
standing
at
street
corners
and
flinging
money
into
the
laps
of
the
poor
and
needy
i
know
not
but
he
came
to
see
me
a
day
or
two
ago
full
of
barbara
building
and
departed
in
high
feather
with
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pounds
in
his
pocket
i
may
remark
here
on
the
peculiar
difficulty
there
is
in
playing
monte
cristo
with
anything
like
picturesque
grace
any
dull
dog
that
owns
a
pen
and
a
can
write
out
cheques
for
charitable
institutions
but
to
accomplish
anything
personal
imaginative
adventurous
anything
with
a
touch
of
distinction
is
a
less
easy
matter
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
with
the
altruistic
yearnings
of
a
francois
de
sales
and
yet
somehow
you
go
to
bed
in
the
evening
with
the
craving
unsatisfied
you
have
really
had
so
few
opportunities
and
when
an
occasion
does
arise
it
is
hedged
around
with
such
difficulties
as
to
baffle
all
but
the
most
persistent
have
you
ever
tried
to
give
a
beggar
a
note
i
did
this
morning
she
was
a
miserable
shivering
starving
woman
of
fifty
selling
matches
in
sackville
street
she
held
out
a
shrivelled
hand
to
me
and
eyes
that
once
had
been
beautiful
pleaded
hungrily
for
alms
here
said
i
to
myself
is
an
opportunity
of
bringing
unimagined
gladness
for
a
month
or
two
into
this
forlorn
creature
i
pressed
a
note
into
her
hand
and
passed
on
she
ran
after
me
terror
on
her
face
i
dare
take
it
sir
they
would
say
i
had
stolen
it
and
i
should
be
locked
up
no
one
would
believe
a
gentleman
had
given
it
to
she
trembled
overwhelmed
by
the
colossal
fortune
that
might
and
yet
might
not
be
hers
i
sympathised
but
not
having
the
change
in
gold
i
could
do
no
more
than
listen
to
an
incoherent
tale
of
misery
which
did
not
aid
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
take
back
the
note
and
yet
if
she
retained
it
she
would
be
subjected
to
scandalous
indignities
what
was
to
be
done
i
turned
my
eyes
towards
piccadilly
and
beheld
a
policeman
a
page
wearing
the
name
of
a
milliner
shop
on
his
cap
whisked
past
me
i
stopped
him
and
slipped
a
shilling
into
his
hand
will
you
ask
that
policeman
to
come
to
me
the
boy
tore
down
the
street
and
told
the
policeman
and
followed
him
up
to
me
eager
for
amusement
what
has
the
woman
been
doing
sir
asked
the
policeman
nothing
said
i
i
have
given
her
a
what
for
sir
he
asked
to
further
my
pursuit
of
the
eumoirous
said
i
whereat
he
gaped
stolidly
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
have
given
it
her
as
a
free
gift
and
she
is
afraid
to
present
it
anywhere
lest
she
should
be
charged
with
theft
will
you
kindly
accompany
her
to
a
shop
where
she
can
change
it
and
vouch
for
her
honesty
the
policeman
who
seemed
to
form
the
lowest
opinion
of
my
intellect
said
he
did
know
a
shop
on
his
beat
where
they
could
change
it
the
boy
whistled
the
woman
held
the
box
of
matches
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
note
fluttering
in
the
breeze
idlers
paused
and
looked
on
the
policeman
grew
authoritative
and
bade
them
pass
along
they
crowded
all
the
more
my
position
was
becoming
embarrassing
at
last
the
boy
remembering
the
badge
of
honour
on
his
cap
undertook
to
change
the
note
at
the
hatter
at
the
corner
of
the
street
so
having
given
the
note
to
the
boy
and
bidden
the
policeman
follow
him
to
see
fair
play
and
encouraged
the
woman
to
follow
the
policeman
i
resumed
my
walk
down
sackville
street
but
what
a
pother
about
a
simple
act
of
charity
in
order
to
repeat
it
habitually
i
shall
have
to
rely
on
the
fortuitous
attendance
of
a
boy
and
a
policeman
or
have
a
policeman
and
a
boy
permanently
attached
to
my
person
which
would
be
as
agreeable
as
the
continuous
escort
of
a
jackdaw
and
a
yak
poor
latimer
is
having
a
dreadful
time
apparently
my
ten
thousand
pounds
have
vanished
like
a
snowflake
on
the
river
of
liabilities
how
he
is
to
repay
me
he
does
not
know
he
wishes
he
had
not
yielded
to
temptation
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
honestly
hammered
then
he
could
have
taken
his
family
to
sing
in
the
streets
with
a
quiet
conscience
my
dear
fellow
said
i
through
the
telephone
this
morning
what
are
ten
thousand
pounds
to
me
i
heard
him
gasp
at
the
other
end
but
you
not
a
millionaire
i
am
i
cried
triumphantly
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
spoke
truly
if
a
man
reckons
his
capital
as
half
a
year
income
doubles
it
and
works
out
the
capital
that
such
a
yearly
income
represents
he
is
the
possessor
of
a
mint
of
money
i
am
i
cried
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
settle
five
thousand
on
lucy
and
the
children
so
that
they
need
accompany
you
in
your
singing
excursions
i
should
like
them
to
catch
cold
poor
dears
and
ruin
their
in
tones
more
than
telephonically
agonised
he
bade
me
not
make
a
jest
of
his
misery
i
nearly
threw
the
receiver
at
the
blockhead
i
not
jesting
i
bawled
i
deadly
serious
i
knew
lucy
before
you
did
and
i
kissed
her
and
she
kissed
me
years
before
she
knew
of
your
high
existence
and
if
she
had
been
a
sensible
woman
she
would
have
married
me
instead
of
you
what
the
first
time
you
heard
of
it
of
course
it
is
and
be
decently
thankful
that
you
hear
it
it
is
pleasant
sometimes
to
tell
the
husbands
of
girls
you
have
loved
exactly
what
you
think
of
them
and
i
had
loved
lucy
latimer
she
came
an
english
rose
to
console
me
for
the
loss
of
my
french
clothilde
or
was
it
the
other
way
about
one
does
get
so
mixed
in
these
things
at
any
rate
she
did
not
marry
me
her
first
love
but
jilted
me
most
abominably
for
latimer
so
i
shall
heap
five
thousand
pounds
on
her
head
i
have
been
unfortunate
in
my
love
affairs
i
wonder
why
which
reminds
me
that
i
made
the
identical
remark
to
lucy
latimer
a
month
or
two
ago
she
is
a
plump
kind
motherly
unromantic
little
person
now
she
had
the
audacity
to
reply
that
i
had
never
had
any
lucy
crooks
dare
say
such
a
thing
i
exclaimed
indignantly
she
smiled
are
there
many
more
qualified
than
i
to
give
the
opinion
i
remember
that
i
rose
and
looked
her
sternly
in
the
face
lucy
crooks
or
lucy
latimer
said
i
you
are
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
common
whereupon
she
laughed
as
if
i
had
paid
her
a
high
compliment
i
maintain
that
i
have
been
unfortunate
in
my
love
affairs
first
there
was
an
widow
a
contemporary
of
my
mother
whom
i
wooed
in
greek
verses
and
let
me
tell
the
young
lover
that
it
is
much
easier
to
write
your
own
doggerel
and
convert
it
into
greek
than
to
put
to
althea
into
decent
anacreontics
i
also
took
her
to
the
eton
and
harrow
match
and
talked
to
her
of
women
hats
and
the
things
she
loved
and
neglected
the
cricket
but
she
would
have
none
of
me
in
the
flood
tide
of
my
passion
she
married
a
scorbutic
archdeacon
of
the
name
of
jugg
then
there
was
a
lady
whose
name
for
the
life
of
me
i
ca
remember
it
was
something
ending
in
we
quarrelled
because
we
held
divergent
views
on
wilson
barrett
then
there
was
clothilde
whose
tragical
story
i
have
already
unfolded
lucy
crooks
who
threw
me
over
for
this
dear
amiable
stockjobbing
latimer
x
y
and
z
but
here
let
me
remark
i
was
the
hunted
mammas
spread
nets
for
me
which
by
the
grace
of
heaven
and
the
ungraciousness
of
the
damsels
i
escaped
and
lastly
my
incomparable
eleanor
faversham
now
i
thought
am
i
safe
in
harbour
if
ever
a
match
could
have
been
labelled
pure
goods
warranted
not
to
shrink
that
was
one
but
for
this
rupture
there
is
an
reason
for
the
others
there
was
none
i
vow
i
went
on
falling
in
love
until
i
grew
absolutely
sick
and
tired
of
the
condition
you
see
the
vocabulary
of
the
pastime
is
so
confoundedly
limited
one
has
to
say
to
b
what
one
has
said
to
a
to
c
exactly
what
one
has
said
to
a
and
b
and
when
it
comes
to
repeating
to
f
the
formularies
one
has
uttered
to
a
b
c
d
and
e
one
grows
almost
hysterical
with
the
boredom
of
it
that
was
the
delightful
charm
of
eleanor
faversham
she
demanded
no
formularies
or
of
raptures
the
officiel
de
has
arrived
it
is
a
volume
of
nearly
eighteen
hundred
pages
and
being
uncut
both
at
top
and
bottom
and
at
the
side
it
is
peculiarly
serviceable
as
a
work
of
reference
i
attacked
it
bravely
however
hacking
my
way
into
it
paperknife
in
hand
but
to
my
dismay
the
more
i
hacked
the
less
could
i
find
of
captain
vauvenarde
i
sought
him
in
the
alphabetical
repertory
of
colonial
troops
in
the
list
of
officers
in
the
lists
of
seniority
in
the
list
of
his
regiment
wherever
he
was
likely
or
unlikely
to
be
there
is
no
person
in
the
french
army
by
the
name
of
vauvenarde
i
went
straight
to
lola
brandt
with
the
hideous
volume
and
the
unwelcome
news
together
we
searched
the
pages
he
be
here
she
said
with
feminine
disregard
of
fact
are
you
quite
certain
you
have
got
the
name
right
i
asked
why
it
is
my
own
name
so
it
is
said
i
i
was
forgetting
but
how
do
you
know
he
was
in
the
army
at
all
he
might
have
been
an
adventurer
a
captain
of
kopenick
of
the
day
who
had
poured
a
gallant
but
mendacious
tale
into
her
ears
i
hardly
ever
saw
him
out
of
uniform
he
was
quartered
at
marseilles
on
special
duty
i
knew
some
of
his
brother
then
said
i
there
are
only
two
alternatives
either
he
has
left
the
army
or
he
is
dead
she
whispered
let
us
hope
said
i
that
he
has
left
the
you
must
find
out
de
gex
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
took
it
for
granted
that
my
husband
was
alive
it
horrible
to
think
that
he
may
be
dead
it
alters
everything
somehow
until
i
know
i
shall
be
in
a
state
of
awful
suspense
you
make
inquiries
at
once
wo
you
did
you
love
your
husband
madame
brandt
i
asked
she
looked
at
the
fire
for
some
time
without
replying
she
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
fender
i
thought
i
did
when
i
married
him
she
said
at
last
i
thought
i
did
when
he
left
and
now
she
turned
her
golden
eyes
full
on
me
it
is
a
disconcerting
trick
of
hers
at
any
time
because
her
eyes
are
at
once
wistful
and
compelling
but
on
this
occasion
it
was
startling
they
held
mine
for
some
seconds
and
i
caught
in
them
a
glimpse
of
the
hieroglyphic
of
the
woman
soul
then
she
turned
her
head
slowly
and
looked
again
into
the
fire
now
she
echoed
many
things
have
happened
between
then
and
now
if
he
is
alive
and
i
go
to
him
i
try
to
think
again
that
i
love
him
it
will
be
the
only
way
it
will
save
me
from
playing
hell
with
my
i
am
glad
you
see
your
relations
to
dale
in
that
light
said
i
i
was
thinking
of
dale
she
said
calmly
of
what
then
if
i
may
ask
without
impertinence
she
broke
into
a
laugh
which
ended
in
a
sigh
and
then
swung
her
splendid
frame
away
from
the
fireplace
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
her
figure
swaying
and
her
arms
flung
about
in
unrestrained
gestures
you
are
quite
right
she
said
with
an
odd
note
of
hardness
in
her
voice
you
quite
right
in
what
you
said
the
other
day
that
it
was
high
time
i
went
back
to
my
husband
i
pray
god
he
is
not
dead
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
is
he
ca
be
i
count
on
you
to
find
him
and
ask
him
to
meet
me
it
would
be
better
than
writing
i
do
know
what
to
say
when
i
have
a
pen
in
my
hand
you
must
find
him
and
speak
to
him
and
send
me
a
wire
and
i
come
straight
away
to
any
part
of
the
earth
or
would
you
like
me
to
come
with
you
and
help
you
find
him
but
no
idiotic
forget
that
i
have
said
it
i
a
fool
but
he
must
be
found
he
must
he
must
she
paused
in
her
swinging
about
the
room
for
which
i
was
sorry
as
her
movements
were
exceedingly
beautiful
and
she
gazed
at
me
with
a
tragic
air
wringing
her
hands
i
was
puzzled
to
find
an
adequate
reason
for
this
sudden
emotional
outburst
hitherto
she
had
accepted
the
prospect
of
a
resumption
of
married
life
with
a
fatalistic
calm
now
when
the
man
is
either
dead
or
has
vanished
into
space
she
pins
all
her
hopes
of
happiness
on
finding
him
and
why
had
her
salvation
from
destruction
nothing
to
do
with
dale
there
is
obviously
another
range
of
emotions
at
work
beneath
it
all
but
what
their
nature
is
baffles
me
although
i
contemplate
with
equanimity
my
little
corner
in
the
garden
of
prosperpine
and
with
indifference
this
common
of
earth
and
although
i
view
mundane
affairs
with
the
same
fine
calm
philosophic
satirical
eye
as
if
i
were
already
a
disembodied
spirit
yet
i
do
not
like
to
be
baffled
it
makes
me
angry
but
during
this
interview
with
lola
brandt
i
had
not
time
to
be
angry
i
am
angry
now
in
fact
i
am
in
a
condition
bordering
on
that
of
a
mad
dog
if
rogers
came
and
disturbed
me
now
as
i
am
writing
i
would
bite
him
but
i
will
set
calmly
down
the
story
of
this
appalling
afternoon
lola
stood
before
me
wringing
her
hands
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
can
get
an
introduction
to
the
de
of
the
information
department
of
the
de
la
in
paris
i
replied
after
a
moment
reflection
he
will
be
able
to
tell
me
whether
captain
vauvenarde
is
alive
or
he
is
alive
he
must
very
well
but
i
doubt
whether
captain
vauvenarde
keeps
the
office
informed
of
his
but
you
go
in
search
of
him
wo
you
the
earth
is
rather
a
large
place
i
objected
he
may
be
in
dieppe
or
he
may
be
on
top
of
mount
i
sure
you
find
him
she
said
encouragingly
you
own
said
i
that
there
something
humourous
in
the
idea
of
my
wandering
all
over
the
surface
of
the
planet
in
search
of
a
lost
captain
of
chasseurs
it
is
true
that
we
might
employ
a
private
yes
she
cried
eagerly
why
not
then
you
could
stay
here
and
i
could
go
on
seeing
you
till
the
news
came
let
us
do
the
swiftness
of
her
change
of
mood
surprised
me
what
is
the
particular
object
of
your
going
on
seeing
me
i
asked
with
a
smile
she
turned
away
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
took
up
her
pensive
attitude
by
the
fire
i
have
no
other
friend
she
said
there
he
not
the
there
sir
joshua
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
down
there
was
a
long
silence
in
some
unaccountable
way
she
had
me
under
her
spell
again
i
felt
a
perfectly
insane
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
ending
this
queer
intimacy
and
i
viewed
her
intrigue
with
dale
with
profound
distaste
lola
had
become
a
habit
the
chair
i
was
sitting
in
was
chair
adolphus
was
dog
i
hated
the
idea
of
dale
making
him
stand
up
and
do
sentry
with
the
fire
shovel
while
lola
sprawled
gracefully
on
the
hearthrug
on
the
other
hand
the
thought
of
remaining
in
london
and
sharing
with
my
young
friend
the
privilege
of
her
society
was
intolerable
i
smoked
and
watching
her
bosom
rise
and
fall
as
she
leaned
forward
with
one
arm
on
the
mantelpiece
argued
it
out
with
myself
and
came
to
the
paradoxical
conclusion
that
i
could
pack
her
off
without
a
pang
to
kamtchatka
and
the
embraces
of
her
unknown
husband
but
could
not
hand
her
over
to
dale
without
feelings
of
the
deepest
repugnance
a
pretty
position
to
find
myself
in
i
threw
away
my
cigarette
impatiently
presently
she
said
not
stirring
from
her
pose
i
shall
miss
you
terribly
if
you
go
a
man
like
you
does
come
into
the
life
of
a
common
woman
like
me
without
she
hesitated
for
a
word
without
making
some
impression
i
ca
bear
to
lose
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
give
up
our
pleasant
comradeship
said
i
but
even
if
i
stay
and
send
the
private
inquiry
agent
instead
of
going
myself
i
sha
be
able
to
go
on
seeing
you
in
this
why
not
it
would
be
scarcely
on
account
of
dale
there
was
another
pause
during
which
i
lit
another
cigarette
when
i
looked
up
i
saw
great
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
a
weeping
woman
always
makes
me
nervous
you
never
know
what
she
is
going
to
do
next
safety
lies
in
checking
the
tears
in
administering
a
tonic
still
her
wish
to
retain
me
was
very
touching
i
rose
and
stood
before
her
by
the
mantelpiece
you
ca
have
your
pudding
and
eat
it
too
said
i
what
do
you
mean
you
ca
have
captain
vauvenarde
for
your
husband
dale
for
your
and
myself
for
your
guide
philosopher
and
friend
all
at
the
same
which
would
you
advise
me
to
give
up
that
obvious
give
up
she
uttered
a
sound
midway
between
a
sob
and
a
laugh
and
said
as
it
seemed
ironically
would
you
take
his
place
somewhat
ironically
too
i
replied
a
crock
my
dear
lady
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
has
no
business
to
put
the
other
into
the
du
but
all
the
same
i
had
an
absurd
desire
to
take
her
at
her
word
not
for
the
sake
of
constituting
myself
her
en
but
so
as
to
dispossess
the
poor
boy
who
was
clamouring
wildly
for
her
among
his
mother
snuffy
colleagues
in
berlin
that
another
reason
why
i
shrink
from
your
going
in
search
of
my
husband
she
said
dabbing
her
eyes
your
i
shall
have
to
go
abroad
out
of
this
dreadful
climate
in
any
case
doctor
orders
and
i
might
just
as
well
travel
about
with
an
object
in
view
as
idle
in
monte
carlo
or
but
you
might
die
she
cried
and
her
tone
touched
my
heart
i
got
to
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
and
the
moment
the
words
passed
my
lips
i
regretted
them
she
turned
a
terrified
look
on
me
and
seized
me
by
the
arms
is
it
as
bad
as
that
why
have
you
told
me
i
lifted
my
arms
to
her
shoulders
and
shook
my
head
and
smiled
into
her
eyes
they
seemed
true
honest
eyes
with
a
world
of
pain
behind
them
if
i
had
not
regarded
myself
as
the
gentleman
in
the
greek
tragedy
walking
straight
to
my
certain
doom
and
therefore
holding
myself
aloof
from
such
vain
things
i
should
have
yielded
to
the
temptation
and
kissed
her
there
and
then
and
then
goodness
knows
what
would
have
happened
as
it
was
it
was
bad
enough
for
as
we
stood
holding
on
to
each
shoulders
in
a
ridiculous
and
compromising
attitude
the
door
opened
and
dale
kynnersley
burst
unannounced
into
the
room
he
paused
on
the
threshold
and
gaped
at
us
chapter
ix
we
sprang
apart
for
all
the
world
like
a
guilty
pair
surprised
luckily
the
room
was
in
its
normal
dim
state
of
illumination
so
that
to
one
suddenly
entering
the
expression
on
our
faces
was
not
clearly
visible
on
the
other
hand
the
subdued
light
gave
a
romantic
setting
to
the
abominable
situation
lola
saved
it
however
she
rushed
to
dale
do
you
know
what
de
gex
was
just
telling
me
his
illness
it
is
worse
than
any
one
thought
it
incurable
he
ca
live
long
he
must
die
soon
it
dreadful
dreadful
did
you
know
it
dale
looked
from
her
to
me
and
after
a
slight
pause
came
forward
is
this
true
simon
a
plague
on
the
woman
for
catching
me
in
the
trap
before
dale
came
in
i
was
on
the
point
of
putting
an
airy
construction
on
my
indiscreet
speech
i
had
no
desire
to
discuss
my
longevity
with
any
one
i
want
to
keep
my
miserable
secret
to
myself
it
was
exasperating
to
have
to
entrust
it
even
to
dale
and
yet
if
i
repudiated
her
implied
explanation
of
our
apparent
embrace
it
would
have
put
her
hopelessly
in
the
wrong
i
had
to
support
her
it
what
the
doctors
say
i
replied
but
whether
it
true
or
not
is
another
again
he
looked
queerly
from
me
to
lola
and
from
lola
back
to
me
his
first
impression
of
our
attitude
had
been
a
shock
from
which
he
found
it
difficult
to
recover
i
smiled
and
although
perfectly
innocent
felt
a
villain
madame
brandt
is
good
enough
to
be
and
to
take
a
tragic
view
of
a
most
commonplace
but
it
is
commonplace
by
god
it
horrible
cried
the
boy
the
arrested
love
for
me
suddenly
gushing
into
his
heart
i
had
no
idea
of
it
in
heaven
name
simon
why
did
you
tell
me
my
dear
old
tears
rushed
into
his
eyes
and
he
gripped
my
hand
until
i
winced
i
put
my
other
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
laughed
with
a
contorted
visage
my
good
dale
the
moribund
are
oh
lord
man
how
can
you
make
a
jest
of
it
would
you
have
me
drive
about
in
a
hearse
instead
of
a
cab
by
way
of
preparation
but
what
have
the
doctors
told
you
asked
lola
my
two
dear
people
i
cried
for
goodness
sake
do
fall
over
me
in
this
way
i
not
going
to
die
unless
my
cook
poisons
me
or
i
struck
by
lightning
i
going
to
live
for
a
deuce
of
a
time
yet
a
couple
of
weeks
at
least
and
you
very
much
oblige
me
by
not
whispering
a
word
abroad
about
what
you
heard
this
afternoon
it
would
cause
me
infinite
annoyance
and
meanwhile
i
suggest
to
you
dale
as
the
lawyers
say
that
you
have
been
impolite
enough
not
to
say
to
your
he
turned
to
her
rather
sheepishly
and
apologised
my
news
had
bowled
him
over
he
declared
he
shook
hands
with
her
laughed
and
walked
adolphus
about
on
his
hind
legs
but
where
have
you
dropped
from
she
asked
berlin
i
came
straight
through
did
you
get
my
wire
i
sent
i
never
got
he
swung
his
arms
about
in
a
fine
rage
if
ever
i
get
hold
of
that
son
of
satan
i
murder
him
he
was
covered
up
to
his
beastly
eyebrows
in
silver
lace
and
swords
and
whistles
and
medals
and
things
he
walked
up
and
down
the
railway
station
as
if
he
owned
the
german
navy
and
ran
trains
as
a
genteel
hobby
i
gave
him
ten
marks
to
send
the
telegram
the
miserable
beast
has
sneaked
the
lot
i
get
at
the
railway
company
through
the
embassy
and
have
the
brute
sacked
and
put
in
prison
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
skunk
he
must
have
thought
you
a
very
simple
and
charming
young
englishman
said
i
you
done
the
same
thing
yourself
he
retorted
indignantly
pardon
me
said
i
if
i
do
send
a
telegram
in
that
loose
way
i
choose
a
humble
and
porter
and
give
him
the
exact
fee
for
the
telegram
and
a
winning
rot
said
dale
and
turning
to
lola
he
has
demoralised
the
whole
railway
system
of
europe
with
his
tips
i
seen
him
give
a
franc
to
the
black
greasy
devil
that
bangs
at
the
carriage
wheels
with
a
bit
of
iron
he
would
give
anybody
he
had
recovered
his
boyish
pride
in
my
ridiculous
idiosyncracies
and
was
in
process
of
illustrating
again
to
lola
what
a
splendid
chap
i
was
poor
lad
if
he
only
knew
what
a
treacherous
traitorous
machiavelli
of
a
hero
he
had
got
for
the
moment
i
suffered
from
a
nasty
crick
in
the
conscience
would
he
adolphus
you
celestial
old
blackguard
he
laughed
then
suddenly
my
hat
you
two
are
fond
of
darkness
it
gives
me
the
creeps
do
you
mind
lola
if
i
turn
on
the
light
he
marched
in
his
young
way
across
to
the
switches
and
set
the
room
in
the
blaze
he
loved
my
crick
of
the
conscience
was
followed
by
an
impulse
of
resentment
he
took
it
for
granted
that
his
will
was
law
in
the
house
he
swaggered
around
the
room
with
a
proprietary
air
he
threw
in
the
casual
lola
as
if
he
owned
her
dale
is
the
most
delightful
specimen
of
the
modern
youth
of
my
acquaintance
but
even
dale
with
all
his
frank
charm
of
manner
has
the
modern
youth
offhand
way
with
women
i
often
wonder
how
women
abide
it
but
they
do
more
shame
to
them
and
suffer
more
than
they
realise
by
their
indulgence
when
next
i
meet
maisie
ellerton
i
will
read
her
a
wholesome
lecture
for
her
good
on
the
proper
treatment
a
female
should
apply
to
the
modern
young
man
dale
filled
the
room
with
his
clear
young
laugh
and
turned
on
every
light
in
the
place
lola
and
i
exchanged
glances
she
had
adopted
her
usual
lazy
pantherine
attitude
in
the
armchair
and
her
glance
was
not
that
of
a
happy
woman
to
whom
a
lover
had
unexpectedly
come
its
real
significance
i
could
not
divine
but
it
was
more
wistful
than
merely
that
of
a
by
george
cried
dale
pulling
up
a
chair
by
lola
side
and
stretching
out
his
long
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
it
good
to
come
back
to
civilisation
and
a
christian
language
and
a
fireside
and
other
things
he
added
squeezing
lola
hand
if
only
it
had
not
been
for
this
horrible
news
about
you
dear
old
man
oh
do
forget
it
and
give
me
a
little
peace
i
cried
why
have
you
come
back
all
of
a
sudden
the
wymington
people
wired
for
me
it
seems
the
committee
are
divided
between
me
and
sir
gerald
he
has
strong
claims
said
i
he
has
been
mayor
of
the
place
and
got
knighted
by
mistake
he
also
gives
large
dinners
and
wears
a
beautiful
diamond
i
believe
he
goes
to
bed
in
it
oh
he
an
awful
ass
it
was
he
who
said
at
a
public
function
mayor
of
wymington
must
be
like
wife
all
things
to
all
men
oh
he
a
colossal
ass
and
his
conceit
my
word
you
need
expatiate
on
it
said
i
i
who
speak
have
suffered
much
at
the
hands
of
sir
gerald
if
he
did
get
into
parliament
he
expect
an
armchair
to
be
put
for
him
next
to
the
speaker
really
lola
you
never
saw
such
a
chap
if
there
was
any
one
else
up
against
me
i
would
mind
anyway
i
running
down
to
wymington
to
interview
the
committee
and
if
they
choose
me
then
it
be
a
case
of
do
help
me
and
do
help
the
and
you
see
the
derndest
best
fight
that
ever
was
i
make
things
hum
in
wymington
he
went
on
eagerly
to
explain
how
he
would
make
things
hum
for
the
moment
he
had
forgotten
his
enchantress
who
understanding
nothing
of
platforms
and
planks
and
electioneering
machinery
smiled
with
pensive
politeness
at
the
fire
here
was
the
dale
that
i
knew
and
loved
boyish
impetuous
slangy
enthusiastic
his
dark
eyes
flashed
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
as
he
enunciated
his
brilliant
ideas
for
capturing
the
constituency
when
i
was
working
for
you
i
made
love
to
half
the
women
in
the
place
you
never
knew
that
you
dear
old
stick
now
i
going
in
on
my
own
account
i
make
love
to
the
whole
crowd
you
wo
mind
lola
will
you
there
safety
in
numbers
and
when
i
have
made
love
to
them
one
by
one
i
get
all
together
and
make
love
to
the
conglomerate
mass
and
then
i
rake
up
all
the
prettiest
women
in
london
and
get
down
there
to
humbug
the
men
lady
kynnersley
will
doubtless
be
there
said
i
and
i
do
quite
see
her
he
broke
in
with
a
laugh
oh
the
mater
i
fix
up
her
job
all
right
she
just
love
it
wo
she
and
then
i
know
a
lot
of
silly
asses
with
who
come
down
they
ca
talk
for
and
think
the
local
option
has
something
to
do
with
vivisection
and
have
a
vague
idea
that
champagne
will
be
cheaper
if
we
get
tariff
reform
but
they
make
a
devil
of
a
noise
at
meetings
and
tote
people
round
the
country
in
their
cars
holding
banners
with
for
kynnersley
on
them
that
a
sound
idea
is
it
i
gravely
commended
the
statesmanlike
sagacity
of
his
plan
of
campaign
and
promised
to
write
as
soon
as
i
got
home
to
one
or
two
members
of
the
committee
whom
i
suspected
of
leanings
i
do
hope
they
adopt
you
i
cried
fervently
so
do
i
murmured
lola
in
her
low
notes
if
they
do
said
dale
i
ask
raggles
to
give
me
an
unpaid
billet
somewhere
but
he
added
with
a
sigh
that
will
be
an
awful
rotten
game
in
i
afraid
you
wo
make
raggles
hum
said
i
he
laughed
rose
and
straddled
across
the
hearthrug
his
back
to
the
fire
he
throw
me
out
if
i
tried
would
he
but
if
they
do
adopt
me
i
swear
i
make
you
proud
of
me
simon
i
stick
my
soul
into
it
the
least
i
can
do
in
this
horrid
cuckoo
sort
of
proceeding
and
i
feel
i
shall
be
fighting
for
you
as
well
as
for
myself
my
dear
old
chap
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
i
knew
and
was
touched
i
wished
him
with
all
my
heart
he
was
a
clean
honest
generous
gentleman
and
i
admired
loved
and
respected
him
as
he
stood
there
full
of
his
youth
and
hope
i
suddenly
felt
quite
old
and
withered
at
the
root
of
my
being
like
some
decrepit
king
who
hands
his
crown
to
the
young
prince
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
for
what
advantage
was
there
in
staying
and
felt
that
i
was
abandoning
to
dale
other
things
beside
my
crown
lola
strong
boneless
hand
closed
round
mine
in
a
more
enveloping
grip
than
ever
she
looked
at
me
appealingly
shall
i
see
you
again
before
you
go
before
you
go
cried
dale
where
are
you
off
to
somewhere
south
out
of
the
when
at
once
said
i
he
turned
to
our
hostess
we
ca
let
him
go
like
that
i
wonder
if
you
could
fix
up
a
little
dinner
here
lola
for
the
three
of
us
it
would
be
ripping
so
cosy
you
he
glowed
with
the
preposterous
inspiration
lola
began
politely
of
course
if
de
gex
it
would
be
delightful
said
i
but
i
starting
at
once
or
the
day
after
we
will
have
the
dinner
when
i
come
back
and
you
are
a
member
of
i
made
my
escape
and
fled
to
my
own
cheerful
library
it
is
and
furnished
with
old
oak
and
the
on
the
walls
are
mellow
of
the
latter
i
have
a
good
collection
among
them
a
prince
rupert
of
which
i
am
proud
i
threw
myself
a
tired
man
into
an
armchair
by
the
fire
and
rang
the
bell
for
a
brandy
and
soda
oh
the
comfort
of
the
rooms
the
comfort
of
rogers
the
comfort
of
the
familiar
backs
of
the
books
in
the
shelves
i
felt
loth
to
leave
it
all
and
go
vagabonding
about
the
cold
world
on
my
lunatic
adventure
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
cursed
marcus
aurelius
i
shook
my
fist
at
him
as
he
stood
on
the
shelf
within
easy
reach
of
my
hand
it
was
he
who
had
put
into
my
head
this
confounded
notion
of
achieving
eumoiriety
am
i
dealing
to
myself
i
asked
a
happy
lot
and
portion
certainly
not
i
replied
and
when
rogers
brought
me
my
brandy
and
soda
i
drank
it
off
desperately
after
that
i
grew
better
and
drew
up
a
merry
little
commination
service
a
plague
on
the
little
pain
inside
a
plague
on
lady
kynnersley
for
weeping
me
into
my
rash
undertaking
a
plague
on
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
for
aiding
and
abetting
lady
kynnersley
a
plague
on
captain
vauvenarde
for
running
away
from
his
wife
for
giving
up
the
army
for
not
letting
me
know
whether
he
is
alive
or
dead
for
being
i
warrant
him
in
the
most
uncomfortable
and
ungetatable
spot
on
the
globe
a
plague
on
dale
for
becoming
infatuated
with
lola
brandt
a
plague
on
him
for
beguiling
me
to
her
acquaintance
for
bursting
into
the
room
at
that
unfortunate
moment
for
his
generous
unsuspecting
love
for
me
for
his
youth
and
hope
and
charm
for
asking
me
to
dine
with
lola
and
himself
in
ripping
cosiness
a
plague
on
myself
just
to
show
that
i
am
and
lastly
a
plague
a
special
plague
a
veritable
murrain
on
lola
brandt
for
complicating
the
splendid
singleness
of
my
purpose
i
know
what
to
think
of
myself
i
have
become
a
common
conundrum
which
provides
the
lowest
form
of
intellectual
amusement
it
is
all
her
fault
listen
i
set
out
to
free
a
young
man
of
brilliant
promise
at
his
mother
earnest
entreaty
from
an
entanglement
with
an
impossible
lady
and
to
bring
him
to
the
feet
of
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
who
is
dying
of
love
for
him
could
intentions
be
simpler
or
more
honourable
or
more
praiseworthy
i
find
myself
after
two
or
three
weeks
the
lady
warm
personal
friend
to
a
certain
extent
her
champion
bound
by
a
quixotic
oath
to
restore
her
husband
to
her
arms
and
regarding
my
poor
dale
with
a
feeling
which
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
jealousy
i
am
praying
heaven
to
grant
his
adoption
by
the
wymington
committee
not
because
it
will
be
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
of
his
career
but
because
the
work
and
excitement
of
a
parliamentary
election
will
prohibit
overmuch
lounging
in
chair
in
lola
brandt
is
there
any
drug
i
wonder
which
can
restore
a
eumoirous
tone
to
the
system
of
course
dale
came
round
to
my
chambers
in
the
evening
and
talked
about
lola
and
himself
and
me
until
i
sent
him
home
to
bed
he
kept
on
repeating
at
intervals
that
i
was
glorious
i
grew
tired
at
last
of
the
eulogy
and
adopting
his
vernacular
declared
that
i
should
be
jolly
glad
to
get
out
of
this
rubbishy
world
he
protested
there
was
never
such
a
world
it
was
gorgeous
what
was
wrong
with
it
anyway
as
i
could
not
show
him
the
commination
service
i
picked
imaginary
flaws
in
the
universe
i
complained
of
its
amateurishness
of
design
but
dale
who
loves
fact
was
not
drawn
into
a
theological
disputation
do
you
know
i
had
a
deuce
of
a
shock
when
i
came
into
lola
this
afternoon
he
cried
irrelevantly
with
a
loud
laugh
i
thought
it
was
a
damnable
and
idiotic
thing
to
come
into
my
head
but
i
could
help
thinking
you
had
cut
me
out
i
wanted
to
tell
you
you
must
forgive
me
for
being
such
an
ass
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
being
so
good
to
her
while
i
was
away
she
has
been
telling
me
you
like
her
do
you
i
knew
you
would
no
one
can
help
it
besides
being
other
things
she
is
such
a
good
sort
is
she
i
admitted
her
many
excellencies
while
he
walked
about
the
room
by
jove
he
cried
coming
to
a
halt
i
got
a
grand
idea
my
little
plan
has
succeeded
so
well
with
you
that
i
a
good
mind
to
try
it
on
my
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
i
asked
why
should
i
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
bring
my
mother
and
lola
together
i
gasped
my
dear
boy
said
i
do
you
want
to
kill
me
outright
i
ca
stand
such
shocks
to
the
but
it
would
be
grand
he
exclaimed
delighted
why
mother
take
a
fancy
to
lola
you
can
imagine
her
roping
her
in
for
the
committee
i
refused
to
imagine
it
for
one
instant
and
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
the
world
to
persuade
him
to
renounce
his
maniacal
project
i
am
going
to
permit
no
further
complications
i
have
been
busy
for
the
past
day
or
two
setting
my
house
in
order
i
start
for
paris
all
my
little
affairs
are
comfortably
settled
and
i
can
set
out
on
my
little
trip
to
avernus
via
paris
and
the
habitat
of
captain
vauvenarde
with
a
quiet
conscience
i
have
allayed
the
anxiety
of
my
sisters
whispered
mysterious
encouragement
to
maisie
ellerton
held
out
hopes
of
her
son
emancipation
to
lady
kynnersley
played
fairy
godmother
to
various
poor
and
deserving
persons
and
brought
myself
into
an
enviable
condition
of
glowing
philanthropy
to
my
great
relief
the
wymington
committee
have
adopted
dale
as
their
candidate
at
the
he
can
scarcely
contain
himself
for
joy
he
is
like
a
child
who
has
been
told
that
he
shall
be
taken
to
the
seaside
i
believe
he
lies
awake
all
night
thinking
how
he
will
make
things
hum
the
other
side
have
chosen
wilberforce
who
unsuccessfully
contested
the
ferney
division
of
wiltshire
at
the
last
general
election
he
is
old
and
ugly
dale
is
young
and
beautiful
i
think
dale
will
get
in
i
have
said
to
lola
the
astonishing
woman
burst
into
tears
and
kissed
my
hands
and
said
something
about
my
being
the
arbiter
of
her
destiny
a
gallic
phrase
which
she
must
have
picked
up
from
captain
vauvenarde
then
she
buried
her
face
in
the
bristling
neck
of
adolphus
the
chow
dog
and
declared
him
to
be
her
last
remaining
consolation
even
anastasius
papadopoulos
had
ceased
to
visit
her
i
uttered
words
of
comfort
i
have
left
you
dale
at
any
she
smiled
enigmatically
through
her
tears
i
not
ungrateful
i
do
despise
the
which
remark
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
was
not
flattering
to
my
young
friend
but
what
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
it
my
fire
is
burning
low
it
is
time
i
ended
this
portion
of
my
rule
and
example
of
eumoiriety
which
i
fear
has
not
followed
the
philosophic
line
i
originally
intended
the
die
is
cast
my
things
are
packed
rogers
who
likes
his
british
beef
and
comforts
is
resigned
to
the
prospect
of
continental
travel
and
has
gone
to
bed
hours
ago
there
is
no
more
soda
water
in
the

i
must

chapter
x
ay
says
touchstone
now
am
i
in
arden
the
more
fool
i
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
in
a
better
now
am
i
in

the
more
fool
i
et
cetera
et
cetera
it
is
true
that
from
my
bedroom
window
in
the
albany
i
can
not
see
the
moon
silvering
the
mediterranean
or
hear
the
soft
swish
of
it
is
true
that
oranges
and
eucalyptus
do
not
flourish
in
the
albany
as
they
do
in
this
hotel
garden
at
mustapha
superieur
it
is
true
that
the
blue
african
sky
and
sunshine
are
more
agreeable
than
piccadilly
fogs
but
after
all
his
own
kennel
is
best
for
a
dying
dog
and
his
own
familiar
surroundings
best
for
his
declining
hours
again
touchstone
had
not
the
faintest
idea
what
he
was
going
to
do
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
i
was
equally
ignorant
of
what
would
befall
when
i
landed
at
algiers
he
was
bound
on
a
fool
adventure
and
so
was
i
he
preferred
the
easy
way
of
home
and
so
do
i
have
always
loved
touchstone
but
i
have
never
thoroughly
understood
him
till
now
it
rained
persistently
in
paris
it
rained
as
i
drove
from
the
gare
du
nord
to
my
hotel
it
rained
all
night
it
rained
all
the
day
i
spent
there
and
it
rained
as
i
drove
from
my
hotel
to
the
gare
de
lyon
a
cheery
newspaper
informed
me
that
there
were
torrential
rains
at
marseilles
i
mentioned
this
to
rogers
who
tried
to
console
me
by
reminding
me
that
we
were
only
staying
at
marseilles
for
a
few
hours
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
i
at
marseilles
i
always
eat
bouillabaisse
on
the
quay
fancy
eating
bouillabaisse
in
the
pouring
rain
as
usual
rogers
could
not
execute
the
imaginative
exercise
i
prescribed
so
he
strapped
my
with
an
extra
jerk
now
when
homespun
london
is
wet
and
muddy
no
one
minds
very
much
but
when
silken
paris
lies
bedraggled
with
rain
and
mud
she
is
the
forlornest
thing
under
the
sky
she
is
a
pale
city
the
rouge
is
washed
from
her
cheeks
her
hair
hangs
dank
and
dishevelled
in
her
aspect
is
desolation
and
moaning
is
in
her
voice
i
have
a
sultanesque
feeling
with
regard
to
paris
so
long
as
she
is
amusing
and
gay
i
love
her
i
adore
her
mirth
her
chatter
her
charming
ways
but
when
she
has
the
toothache
and
snivels
she
bores
me
to
death
i
lose
all
interest
in
her
i
want
to
clap
my
hands
for
my
slaves
in
order
to
bid
them
bring
me
in
something
less
dismal
in
the
way
of
fair
cities
i
drove
to
the
rue
and
handed
in
my
card
and
letter
of
introduction
at
the
de
la
i
was
received
by
the
official
in
charge
of
the
des
with
bland
politeness
tempered
with
suspicion
that
i
might
be
taking
a
mental
photograph
of
the
office
furniture
in
order
to
betray
its
secret
to
a
foreign
government
after
many
comings
and
goings
of
orderlies
and
underlings
he
told
me
very
little
in
complicated
and
reluctant
language
captain
vauvenarde
had
resigned
his
commission
in
the
chasseurs
two
years
ago
at
the
present
moment
the
bureau
had
no
information
to
give
as
to
his
domicile
have
you
no
suggestion
monsieur
to
offer
i
asked
whereby
i
may
obtain
this
essential
information
concerning
captain
vauvenarde
his
old
comrades
in
the
regiment
might
know
and
the
regiment
he
opened
the
officiel
de
just
as
i
might
have
done
myself
and
said
there
are
six
regiments
one
is
at
blidah
another
at
tlemcen
another
at
constantine
another
at
tunis
another
at
algiers
and
another
at
to
which
regiment
then
did
captain
vauvenarde
belong
i
inquired
he
referred
to
one
of
the
dossiers
that
the
orderlies
had
brought
him
the
i
should
get
information
then
from
tlemcen
evidently
i
thanked
him
and
withdrew
to
his
obvious
relief
seekers
after
knowledge
are
unpopular
even
in
organisations
so
far
removed
from
the
circumlocution
office
as
the
french
de
la
however
he
had
put
me
on
the
trail
of
my
man
during
my
homeward
drive
through
the
rain
i
reflected
i
might
of
course
write
to
the
of
the
regiment
at
tlemcen
and
wait
for
his
reply
but
even
if
he
answered
by
return
of
post
i
should
have
to
remain
in
paris
for
nearly
a
week
that
said
i
wiping
from
my
face
half
a
teacupful
of
liquid
mud
which
had
squirted
in
through
the
cab
window
that
i
never
do
proceed
at
once
to
algiers
if
i
can
get
no
news
of
him
there
i
go
to
tlemcen
myself
in
all
probability
i
shall
learn
that
he
is
residing
here
in
paris
a
stone
throw
from
the
so
i
started
for
algiers
the
next
morning
before
the
sailing
of
the
one
of
the
quaint
churns
styled
a
steamship
by
the
vanity
of
the
french
company
which
undertakes
to
convey
respectable
folk
across
the
mediterranean
i
ate
my
bouillabaisse
below
an
awning
on
the
sunny
quay
at
marseilles
the
torrential
rains
had
ceased
i
advised
rogers
to
take
equivalent
sustenance
as
no
lunch
is
provided
on
day
of
sailing
by
the
compagnie
generale
transatlantique
i
caught
sight
of
him
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
restaurant
he
is
too
british
to
eat
in
the
open
air
on
the
terrace
or
perhaps
too
modest
to
have
his
meal
in
my
presence
struggling
grimly
with
a
beefsteak
and
as
he
is
a
teetotaller
with
an
unimaginable
horrific
liquid
which
he
poured
out
from
a
vessel
vaguely
resembling
a
teapot
my
meal
over
and
having
nearly
an
hour
to
spare
i
paid
my
bill
rose
and
turned
the
corner
of
the
quay
into
the
cannebiere
thinking
to
have
my
coffee
at
one
of
the
cafes
in
that
thoroughfare
of
which
the
natives
say
that
if
paris
had
a
cannebiere
it
would
be
a
little
marseilles
i
suppose
for
the
marseillais
there
is
a
magic
in
the
sonorous
name
for
after
all
it
is
but
a
commonplace
street
of
shops
running
from
the
quays
into
the
heart
of
the
town
it
is
also
deformed
by
tramcars
i
strolled
leisurely
up
thinking
of
the
many
swans
that
were
geese
and
paradises
that
were
and
heroes
that
were
dummies
and
solidities
that
were
shadows
in
short
enjoying
a
gentle
mood
when
my
eyes
suddenly
fell
on
a
scene
which
brought
me
down
from
such
realities
to
the
realm
of
the
fantastic
there
a
few
yards
in
front
of
me
at
the
outer
edge
of
the
terrace
of
a
cafe
clad
in
his
eternal
silk
hat
frock
coat
and
yellow
gloves
sat
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
seedy
stranger
of
repellent
mien
the
latter
was
and
had
a
broken
nose
and
wore
a
little
round
soft
felt
hat
the
dwarf
was
facing
me
as
he
caught
sight
of
me
a
smile
of
welcome
overspread
his
napoleonic
features
he
rose
awaited
my
approach
and
bareheaded
made
his
usual
sweeping
bow
which
he
concluded
by
resting
his
silk
hat
on
the
pit
of
his
stomach
i
lifted
my
hat
politely
and
would
have
passed
on
but
he
stood
in
my
path
i
extended
my
hand
he
took
it
after
the
manner
of
a
provincial
mayor
receiving
royalty
monsieur
je
vous
en
said
i
he
covered
his
head
monsieur
said
he
i
beseech
you
to
be
seated
and
do
me
the
honour
of
joining
me
in
the
coffee
and
excellent
cognac
of
this
willingly
said
i
mindful
of
lola
tale
of
the
long
knife
which
he
carried
concealed
about
his
person
permit
me
to
present
my
friend
monsieur
achille
saupiquet
monsieur
de
gex
a
great
english
statesman
and
a
friend
of
that
madame
lola
monsieur
saupiquet
and
i
saluted
each
other
formally
i
took
a
seat
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
moved
a
bundle
of
papers
tied
up
with
pink
ribbon
from
in
front
of
me
and
ordered
coffee
and
cognac
monsieur
saupiquet
also
knows
madame
brandt
he
explained
said
monsieur
saupiquet
she
owes
me
fifteen
papadopoulos
turned
on
his
sharply
will
you
be
silent
the
other
grumbled
beneath
his
breath
i
hope
madame
is
well
said
papadopoulos
i
said
that
she
appeared
so
when
last
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
the
dwarf
turned
to
his
friend
monsieur
has
also
done
my
cats
the
honour
of
attending
a
rehearsal
he
has
seen
hephaestus
and
his
tears
have
dropped
in
sympathy
over
the
irreparable
loss
of
my
beautiful
santa
i
hope
the
talented
survivors
said
i
are
enjoying
their
usual
my
daily
bulletin
from
my
pupil
and
assistant
quast
contains
excellent
reports
it
was
only
when
i
found
myself
at
the
table
with
the
dwarf
and
his
friend
that
i
collected
my
wits
sufficiently
to
realise
the
probable
reason
of
his
presence
in
marseilles
the
grotesque
little
creature
had
actually
kept
his
ridiculous
word
he
too
had
come
south
in
search
of
the
lost
captain
vauvenarde
we
were
companions
in
the
fool
adventure
there
was
something
mediaeval
in
the
combination
something
legendary
put
back
the
clock
a
few
centuries
and
there
we
were
the
knight
and
the
dwarf
riding
together
on
our
quest
while
the
lady
for
whose
sake
we
were
making
idiots
of
ourselves
was
twiddling
her
fair
thumbs
in
her
tower
far
beyond
the
seas
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
broke
upon
this
pleasing
fancy
by
remarking
again
that
monsieur
saupiquet
was
a
friend
of
madame
brandt
he
was
with
her
at
the
time
of
her
great
bereavement
i
asked
forgetfully
her
horse
he
whispered
the
words
with
solemn
reverence
i
must
confess
to
being
tired
of
the
horse
sultan
and
disinclined
to
treat
his
loss
seriously
monsieur
saupiquet
said
i
doubtless
offered
her
every
he
used
to
travel
with
her
and
look
after
sultan
he
was
her
her
master
of
the
horse
i
suggested
precisely
you
have
the
power
of
using
the
right
word
monsieur
de
gex
it
is
a
great
gift
my
good
friend
saupiquet
is
attached
to
a
circus
at
present
stationed
in
toulon
he
came
over
at
my
request
to
see
me
on
affairs
of
the
deepest
importance
he
waved
the
bundle
of
papers
the
very
deepest
importance
saupiquet
murmured
saupiquet
who
evidently
did
not
count
loquacity
among
his
vices
i
wondered
whether
these
important
affairs
concerned
the
whereabouts
of
captain
vauvenarde
but
the
dwarf
air
of
mystery
forbade
my
asking
for
his
confidence
besides
what
should
a
groom
in
a
circus
know
of
retired
captains
of
chasseurs
i
said
you
a
very
busy
man
monsieur
le
he
tapped
his
domelike
forehead
i
am
never
idle
i
carry
on
here
gigantic
combinations
i
should
have
been
a
lawyer
i
can
spread
nets
that
no
one
sees
and
then
pst
i
draw
the
rope
and
the
victim
is
in
the
toils
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
du
nicht
das
saupiquet
said
saupiquet
again
he
seemed
perfectly
conversant
with
the
dwarf
polyglot
jargon
to
the
temperament
of
the
artist
continued
the
modest
papadopoulos
i
join
the
intellect
of
the
man
of
affairs
and
the
heart
of
a
young
poet
i
am
always
young
yet
as
you
see
me
here
i
am
years
of
he
jumped
from
his
chair
and
struck
an
attitude
of
the
apollo
belvedere
i
should
never
have
thought
that
you
were
of
the
same
age
as
a
bettered
person
like
myself
said
i
the
secret
of
youth
he
rejoined
sitting
down
again
is
enthusiasm
the
worship
of
a
woman
and
intimate
association
with
monsieur
saupiquet
received
this
proposition
without
a
gleam
of
interest
manifesting
itself
in
his
dull
blue
eyes
his
broken
nose
gave
his
face
a
singularly
unintelligent
expression
he
poured
out
another
glass
of
cognac
from
the
graduated
carafe
in
front
of
him
and
sipped
it
slowly
then
he
gazed
at
me
dully
almost
for
the
first
time
and
said
madame
brandt
owes
me
fifteen
and
i
say
that
she
does
cried
the
dwarf
fiercely
i
send
for
him
to
discuss
matters
of
the
deepest
gravity
and
he
comes
talking
about
his
fifteen
sous
i
ca
get
anything
out
of
him
but
his
fifteen
sous
and
the
does
owe
it
to
him
she
ca
owe
it
to
him
saupiquet
if
you
do
renounce
your
miserable
pretensions
you
will
drive
me
mad
you
will
make
me
burst
into
tears
you
will
make
me
throw
you
out
into
the
street
and
hold
you
down
until
you
are
run
over
by
a
tramcar
you
will
you
will
he
shook
his
fist
passionately
as
he
sought
for
a
climactic
menace
you
will
make
me
spit
in
your
he
dashed
his
fist
down
on
the
marble
table
so
that
the
glasses
jingled
saupiquet
finished
his
cognac
undisturbed
i
say
that
madame
brandt
owes
me
fifteen
sous
and
until
that
is
paid
i
do
no
the
little
man
grew
white
with
exasperation
and
his
upper
lip
lifted
like
an
angry
cat
showing
his
teeth
i
shrank
from
meeting
saupiquet
eye
hurriedly
i
drew
a
providential
handful
of
coppers
from
my
pocket
stop
herr
professor
said
i
eager
to
prevent
the
shedding
of
tears
blood
or
saliva
i
have
just
remembered
madame
did
mention
to
me
an
unaquitted
debt
in
the
south
and
begged
me
to
settle
it
for
her
i
am
delighted
to
have
the
opportunity
will
you
permit
me
to
act
as
banker
the
dwarf
at
once
grew
suave
and
courteous
the
word
of
is
the
word
of
god
said
he
i
solemnly
counted
out
the
fifteen
halfpence
on
the
table
and
pushed
them
over
to
saupiquet
who
swept
them
up
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
now
we
can
talk
said
he
make
him
give
you
a
receipt
cried
papadopoulos
excitedly
i
know
him
he
is
capable
of
any
treachery
where
money
is
concerned
he
is
capable
of
the
sum
from
madame
brandt
he
is
an
ingrate
and
she
monsieur
le
membre
du
parlement
anglais
has
overwhelmed
him
with
benefits
do
you
know
what
she
did
she
gave
him
the
carcass
of
her
beloved
sultan
to
dispose
of
and
he
sold
it
monsieur
and
he
got
drunk
on
the
the
mingled
emotions
of
sorrow
at
the
demise
of
sultan
the
royal
generosity
of
madame
brandt
and
the
turpitude
of
his
friend
saupiquet
brought
tears
to
the
little
man
eyes
monsieur
saupiquet
shrugged
his
shoulders
unconcernedly
a
poor
man
has
to
get
drunk
when
he
can
it
is
only
the
rich
who
can
get
drunk
when
they
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
rose
in
a
hurry
i
afraid
i
must
take
an
unceremonious
leave
of
you
monsieur
le
you
must
wait
for
the
receipt
cried
the
dwarf
will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
holding
it
for
me
until
we
meet
again
hi
the
interpellation
was
addressed
to
a
cabman
a
few
yards
away
your
conversation
has
made
me
neglect
the
flight
of
time
i
shall
only
just
catch
my
your
boat
i
am
going
to
where
will
you
be
staying
monsieur
i
ask
in
no
spirit
of
vulgar
i
raised
a
protesting
hand
and
with
a
smile
named
my
hotel
i
arrived
here
from
algiers
yesterday
afternoon
he
said
and
i
proceed
there
again
i
regret
said
i
that
you
are
not
coming
so
that
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
on
the
my
polite
formula
seemed
to
delight
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
enormously
he
made
a
series
of
the
most
complicated
bows
to
the
joy
of
the
waiters
and
the
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
with
the
stolid
monsieur
saupiquet
and
waving
my
hat
more
like
an
excited
montenegrin
than
the
most
respectable
of
british
valetudinarians
i
drove
off
to
the
quai
de
la
joliette
where
i
found
an
anxious
but
dogged
rogers
in
the
midst
of
a
vociferating
crowd
literally
holding
the
bridge
that
gave
access
to
the
thank
heaven
you
come
sir
you
almost
missed
it
i
could
have
held
out
another
i
too
was
thankful
if
i
had
missed
the
boat
i
should
have
had
to
wait
till
the
next
day
and
crossed
in
the
embarrassing
and
unrestful
company
of
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
it
is
not
that
i
dislike
the
little
man
or
have
the
briton
nervous
shrinking
from
being
seen
in
eccentric
society
but
i
wish
to
eliminate
mediaevalism
as
far
as
possible
from
my
quest
in
conjunction
with
this
little
trainer
of
cats
it
would
become
too
preposterous
even
for
my
light
sardonic
humour
i
resolved
to
dismiss
him
from
my
mind
altogether
yet
in
spite
of
my
determination
and
in
spite
of
one
of
monsieur
lenotre
fascinating
monographs
on
the
french
revolution
on
which
i
had
counted
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
the
journey
i
could
not
get
anastasius
papadopoulos
out
of
my
head
he
stayed
with
me
the
whole
of
a
night
and
all
the
next
morning
he
has
haunted
my
brain
ever
since
i
see
him
tossing
his
arms
about
in
fury
while
the
saupiquet
makes
his
monotonous
claim
for
the
payment
of
sevenpence
halfpenny
i
hear
him
speak
in
broken
whispers
of
the
disastrous
quadruped
on
whose
skin
and
hoofs
saupiquet
got
drunk
i
see
him
strutting
about
and
boasting
of
his
intellect
i
see
him
taking
leave
of
lola
brandt
and
trotting
magnificently
out
of
the
room
bent
on
finding
captain
vauvenarde
he
haunts
my
slumbers
i
hope
to
goodness
he
will
not
take
to
haunting
this
delectable
hotel
i
wonder
after
all
whether
there
is
any
method
in
his
madness
for
mad
he
is
as
mad
as
can
be
why
does
he
come
backwards
and
forwards
between
algiers
and
marseilles
what
has
saupiquet
to
do
with
his
quest
what
revelation
was
he
about
to
make
on
the
payment
of
his
fifteen
sous
it
is
all
so
grotesque
so
out
of
relation
with
ordinary
life
i
feel
inclined
to
go
up
to
the
retired
colonels
and
elderly
maiden
ladies
who
seem
to
form
the
majority
of
my
and
pinch
them
and
ask
them
whether
they
are
real
or
like
papadopoulos
and
saupiquet
the
gentler
creatures
of
a
nightmare
well
i
have
written
to
the
of
the
regiment
of
chasseurs
at
tlemcen
which
is
away
down
by
the
morocco
frontier
i
have
also
written
to
lola
brandt
i
seem
to
miss
her
as
much
as
any
of
the
friends
i
have
left
behind
me
in
england
i
can
not
help
the
absurd
fancy
that
her
rich
vitality
helps
me
along
i
have
not
been
feeling
quite
so
robust
as
i
did
when
i
saw
her
daily
and
twinges
are
coming
more
frequently
i
do
think
that
rolling
about
in
the
mediterranean
on
board
the
is
good
for
little
pains
inside
chapter
xi
when
i
began
this
autobiographical
sketch
of
the
last
few
weeks
of
my
existence
i
had
conceived
as
i
have
already
said
the
notion
of
making
it
chiefly
a
guide
to
conduct
for
my
young
disciple
dale
kynnersley
not
only
was
it
to
explain
to
him
clearly
the
motives
which
led
to
my
taking
any
particular
line
of
action
with
regard
to
his
affairs
and
so
enable
me
to
escape
whatever
blame
he
might
through
misunderstanding
be
disposed
to
cast
on
me
but
also
to
elevate
his
mind
stimulate
his
ambitions
and
improve
his
morals
it
was
to
be
a
manual
of
eumoiriety
it
was
to
be
sweetened
with
philosophic
reflections
and
adorned
with
allusions
to
the
lives
of
the
great
masters
of
their
destiny
who
have
passed
away
it
was
to
have
been
a
pretty
little
work
after
the
manner
of
montaigne
with
the
exception
that
it
ran
of
its
own
accord
into
narrative
form
but
i
am
afraid
lola
brandt
has
interposed
herself
between
me
and
my
design
she
had
brought
me
down
from
the
serene
philosophic
plane
where
i
could
think
and
observe
human
happenings
and
analyse
them
and
present
them
in
their
true
aspect
to
my
young
friend
she
has
set
me
down
in
the
thick
of
events
and
not
events
such
as
the
smiling
philosopher
is
in
the
habit
of
dealing
with
but
lunatic
fantastic
occurrences
with
which
no
system
of
philosophy
invented
by
man
is
capable
of
grappling
i
can
just
keep
my
head
that
is
all
and
note
down
what
happens
more
or
less
day
by
day
so
that
when
the
doings
of
dwarfs
and
captains
and
and
youthful
members
of
parliament
concern
me
no
more
dale
kynnersley
can
have
a
bald
but
veracious
statement
of
fact
and
as
i
have
before
mentioned
he
loves
facts
just
as
a
bear
loves
honey
i
passed
a
quiet
day
or
two
in
my
hotel
garden
among
the
and
the
roses
and
the
geraniums
there
were
little
shady
where
one
could
sit
and
dream
and
watch
the
blue
sky
and
the
palms
and
the
feathery
pepper
trees
drooping
with
their
coral
berries
and
the
golden
and
the
wisteria
and
the
great
gorgeous
splash
of
purple
bougainvillea
above
the
moorish
arches
of
the
hotel
there
were
mild
little
walks
in
the
eucalyptus
woods
behind
where
one
went
through
acanthus
and
wild
absinthe
and
here
and
there
as
the
path
wound
the
great
blue
bay
came
into
view
and
far
away
the
peaks
of
the
atlas
there
were
warmth
and
sunshine
and
the
unexciting
prattle
of
the
retired
colonels
and
maiden
ladies
there
was
a
hotel
library
filled
with
archaic
fiction
i
took
out
ainsworth
tower
of
london
and
passed
a
happy
morning
in
the
sun
renewing
the
thrills
of
my
childhood
i
began
to
forget
the
outer
world
in
my
enchanted
garden
like
a
knight
in
the
forest
of
broceliande
then
came
the
letter
from
tlemcen
the
commanding
the
regiment
of
chasseurs
had
received
my
honoured
communication
but
regretted
to
say
that
he
together
with
all
the
officers
of
the
regiment
had
severed
their
connection
with
captain
vauvenarde
and
that
they
were
ignorant
of
his
present
address
this
was
absurd
a
man
does
not
resign
from
his
regiment
and
within
a
year
or
two
disappear
like
a
ghost
from
the
ken
of
every
one
of
his
brother
officers
i
read
the
letter
again
did
the
severance
of
connection
mean
the
casting
out
of
a
black
sheep
from
their
midst
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
did
they
had
washed
their
hands
of
captain
vauvenarde
and
desired
to
hear
nothing
of
him
in
the
future
so
i
awoke
from
my
lethargy
and
springing
up
sent
not
for
my
shield
and
spear
but
for
an
indicateur
des
chemins
de
i
would
go
to
tlemcen
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
searched
the
and
found
two
trains
one
starting
from
algiers
at
at
night
and
getting
into
tlemcen
at
noon
next
day
and
one
leaving
at
in
the
morning
and
arriving
at
ten
at
night
i
groaned
aloud
the
dealing
unto
oneself
a
happy
life
and
portion
did
not
include
abominable
train
journeys
like
these
i
was
trying
to
decide
whether
i
should
travel
all
night
or
all
day
when
the
arab
chasseur
of
the
hotel
brought
me
a
telegram
i
opened
it
it
ran
starting
for
algiers
meet
it
was
despatched
that
morning
from
victoria
station
i
gazed
at
it
stupidly
why
in
the
world
was
lola
brandt
coming
to
join
me
in
algiers
if
she
had
wanted
to
do
her
husband
hunting
on
her
own
account
why
had
she
put
me
to
the
inconvenience
of
my
journey
her
action
could
not
have
been
determined
by
my
letter
about
anastasius
papadopoulos
as
a
short
calculation
proved
that
it
could
not
have
reached
her
i
wandered
round
and
round
the
garden
paths
vainly
seeking
for
the
motive
was
it
escape
from
dale
had
she
womanlike
taken
the
step
which
she
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
and
in
order
to
avoid
taking
which
all
this
bother
had
arisen
and
given
the
boy
his
dismissal
if
so
why
had
she
not
gone
to
paris
or
petersburg
or
terra
del
fuego
why
algiers
dale
abandoned
outright
the
necessity
for
finding
her
husband
had
disappeared
perhaps
she
was
coming
to
request
me
on
that
account
to
give
up
the
search
but
why
travel
across
seas
and
continents
when
a
telegram
or
a
letter
would
have
sufficed
she
was
coming
at
any
rate
and
as
she
gave
no
date
i
presumed
that
she
would
travel
straight
through
and
arrive
in
about
hours
this
reflection
caused
a
gleam
of
sunshine
to
traverse
my
gloom
i
was
not
physically
capable
of
performing
the
journey
to
tlemcen
and
back
before
her
arrival
i
could
therefore
dream
among
the
roses
of
the
garden
for
another
couple
of
days
and
when
she
came
perhaps
she
would
like
to
go
to
tlemcen
herself
and
try
the
effect
of
her
woman
fascinations
on
the
and
officers
of
the
regiment
of
chasseurs
in
any
case
her
sudden
departure
argued
well
for
dale
liberation
if
the
rupture
had
occurred
i
was
quite
contented
that
is
what
i
had
wished
to
accomplish
it
only
remained
now
to
return
to
london
while
breath
yet
stayed
in
my
body
and
lead
him
diplomatically
to
the
feet
of
maisie
ellerton
then
i
would
have
ended
my
eumoirous
task
and
my
last
happy
words
would
be
a
paternal
benediction
but
all
the
same
i
had
set
forth
to
find
this
confounded
captain
and
did
not
want
to
be
hindered
the
sportsman
instinct
which
in
my
robust
youth
had
led
me
to
crawl
miles
on
my
belly
over
wet
heather
in
order
to
get
a
shot
at
a
stag
i
found
somewhat
to
my
alarm
was
urging
me
on
this
chase
after
captain
vauvenarde
he
was
my
quarry
i
resented
interference
then
and
now
i
wanted
no
petticoats
in
the
party
i
worked
myself
up
into
an
absurd
state
of
irritability
why
was
she
coming
to
spoil
the
sport
i
had
arranged
to
track
her
husband
down
reason
with
him
work
on
his
feelings
telegraph
for
his
wife
and
in
an
affecting
interview
throw
them
into
each
other
arms
now
goodness
knows
what
would
happen
certainly
not
my
beautifully
conceived
de
and
she
has
the
impertinence
i
cried
in
my
wrath
to
sign
herself
as
if
i
ever
called
her
or
could
ever
be
in
a
position
to
call
her
i
should
like
to
know
i
exclaimed
hurling
the
indicateur
des
chemins
de
fer
on
to
the
seat
of
a
built
after
the
manner
of
a
little
greek
temple
i
should
like
to
know
what
the
deuce
she
means
by
it
hallo
hallo
what
the
devil
the
matter
cried
a
voice
and
i
found
i
had
disturbed
from
his
slumbers
an
unnoticed
colonel
of
british
cavalry
a
thousand
pardons
said
i
i
thought
i
was
alone
and
gave
vent
to
the
feelings
of
the
colonel
bunnion
stretched
himself
and
joined
me
that
the
worst
of
this
place
he
said
it
so
liverish
one
lolls
about
and
sleeps
all
day
long
and
one
liver
gets
like
a
strasburg
goose
and
plays
old
harry
with
one
temper
why
one
should
come
here
when
there
are
pheasants
to
be
shot
in
england
i
do
neither
your
liver
nor
your
temper
seem
to
be
much
affected
colonel
said
i
for
you
been
violently
awakened
from
a
sweet
sleep
and
are
in
a
most
amiable
frame
of
he
laughed
suggested
exercise
the
briton
panacea
for
all
ills
and
took
me
for
a
walk
when
we
returned
at
dusk
and
after
i
had
had
tea
before
the
fire
for
december
evenings
in
algiers
are
chilly
in
one
of
the
pretty
moorish
alcoves
of
the
lounge
my
good
humour
was
restored
i
viewed
our
pursuit
of
captain
vauvenarde
in
its
right
aspect
that
of
a
veritable
of
which
i
was
the
bellman
and
the
name
lola
curled
itself
round
my
heart
with
the
same
grateful
sensation
of
comfort
as
the
warm
china
tea
after
all
it
was
only
as
lola
that
i
thought
of
her
the
name
fitted
her
personality
which
brandt
did
not
out
of
brandt
i
defy
you
to
get
any
curvilinear
suggestion
i
reflected
dreamily
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
walk
with
her
among
the
roses
in
the
sunshine
and
to
drink
tea
with
her
in
dusky
moorish
alcoves
i
also
thought
with
an
enjoyable
spice
of
malice
of
what
the
retired
colonels
and
elderly
maiden
ladies
would
have
to
say
about
lola
when
she
arrived
they
should
have
a
gorgeous
time
so
did
i
become
that
the
next
evening
while
i
was
dressing
for
dinner
i
did
not
frown
when
the
chasseur
brought
me
up
the
huge
trilingual
of
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
show
the
gentleman
up
said
rogers
handed
me
my
black
tie
and
began
to
gather
together
discarded
garments
so
as
to
make
the
room
tidy
for
the
visitor
it
was
a
comfortable
with
the
bed
in
an
alcove
and
a
tiny
attached
a
wood
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
on
each
side
of
which
was
an
armchair
presently
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
rogers
opened
it
and
admitted
papadopoulos
who
forthwith
began
to
execute
his
usual
manoeuvres
of
salutation
rogers
stood
staring
and
at
the
apparition
it
took
all
his
professional
training
in
imperturbability
to
enable
him
to
make
a
decent
exit
this
increased
my
good
humour
i
grasped
the
dwarf
hand
my
dear
professor
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
pray
excuse
my
receiving
you
in
this
unceremonious
fashion
and
sit
down
by
the
i
hastily
completed
my
toilette
by
stuffing
my
watch
loose
change
and
handkerchief
into
my
pockets
and
took
a
seat
opposite
him
it
is
i
said
he
politely
who
must
apologise
for
this
untimely
call
i
have
wanted
to
pay
my
respects
to
you
since
i
arrived
in
algiers
but
till
now
i
have
had
no
allow
me
said
i
to
disembarrass
you
of
your
i
took
the
thing
which
he
was
nursing
somewhat
nervously
on
his
knees
and
put
it
on
the
table
he
murmured
that
i
was
and
the
charming
monsieur
saupiquet
how
is
he
i
asked
he
drew
out
his
and
from
it
extracted
an
envelope
this
said
he
handing
it
to
me
is
the
receipt
i
have
to
thank
you
again
for
regulating
the
debt
as
it
has
enabled
me
to
transact
with
monsieur
saupiquet
the
business
on
which
i
summoned
him
from
toulon
he
is
the
most
obstinate
camel
that
ever
lived
and
i
believe
he
has
returned
to
toulon
in
the
best
of
health
no
thank
you
he
added
refusing
my
offer
of
cigarettes
i
do
smoke
it
disturbs
the
perfect
adjustment
of
my
nerves
and
so
imperils
my
gigantic
combinations
it
is
also
distasteful
to
my
you
must
miss
them
greatly
said
i
he
sighed
then
his
face
lit
up
with
inspiration
ah
signor
what
would
one
not
sacrifice
for
an
idea
for
duty
for
honour
for
the
happiness
of
those
we
love
those
are
sentiments
monsieur
papadopoulos
i
remarked
which
do
you
infinite
and
therefore
i
express
them
sir
he
replied
to
show
you
what
manner
of
man
i
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
bending
forward
his
hands
on
his
little
knees
he
was
sitting
far
back
in
the
chair
and
his
legs
were
dangling
like
a
child
he
regarded
me
intently
would
you
be
equally
chivalrous
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
i
replied
that
i
hoped
i
should
conduct
myself
galant
in
any
circumstances
i
knew
it
he
cried
my
intuition
is
never
wrong
an
english
statesman
is
as
fearless
as
agamemnon
and
as
wise
as
nestor
have
you
your
evening
free
yes
i
replied
wonderingly
would
you
care
to
devote
it
to
a
perilous
adventure
not
so
perilous
for
i
he
thumped
his
chest
will
be
there
but
still
his
black
eyes
held
mine
in
burning
intensity
so
as
to
hide
a
smile
i
lit
a
cigarette
i
know
not
what
little
imp
in
motley
possessed
me
that
evening
he
seemed
to
hit
me
over
the
head
with
his
bladder
and
counsel
me
to
play
the
fool
like
himself
for
once
in
my
life
before
i
died
i
could
almost
hear
him
speaking
surely
a
crazy
dwarf
out
of
a
nightmare
is
more
entertaining
company
than
decayed
colonels
of
british
i
blew
two
or
three
puffs
of
my
cigarette
and
met
my
guest
eager
gaze
i
shall
be
happy
to
put
myself
at
your
disposal
said
i
may
i
ask
without
indiscretion
no
no
he
interrupted
do
ask
secrecy
is
part
of
the
gigantic
combination
galant
i
require
of
you
with
an
irresistible
touch
of
mockery
i
said
professor
papadopoulos
i
will
be
happy
to
follow
you
blindfold
to
the
lair
of
whatever
dragon
you
may
want
me
to
help
you
he
rose
and
grasped
his
hat
and
made
me
a
profound
bow
you
will
not
find
me
wanting
in
courage
monsieur
there
is
another
small
favour
i
would
ask
of
you
will
you
bring
some
of
your
with
pleasure
said
i
at
that
moment
the
gong
clanged
loudly
through
the
hotel
it
is
your
said
the
dwarf
i
depart
our
rendezvous
let
us
have
no
rendezvous
my
dear
professor
i
interposed
what
more
simple
than
that
you
should
do
me
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
me
here
we
can
thus
fortify
ourselves
with
food
and
drink
for
our
adventure
and
we
can
start
on
it
comfortably
together
whenever
it
seems
good
to
the
little
man
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
me
in
an
odd
way
do
you
mean
he
asked
in
a
softened
voice
that
you
ask
me
to
dine
with
you
in
the
midst
of
your
aristocratic
compatriots
why
evidently
said
i
baffled
it
only
an
ordinary
table
to
my
astonishment
tears
actually
spurted
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
amazing
little
creature
he
took
my
hand
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
he
had
touched
it
with
his
lips
my
dear
professor
i
cried
in
dismay
he
put
up
a
pudgy
hand
and
said
with
great
dignity
i
can
not
dine
with
you
monsieur
de
gex
but
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
your
generous
kindness
i
shall
never
forget
it
to
my
dying
but
he
would
listen
to
no
protests
if
you
will
do
me
the
honour
of
coming
at
nine
to
the
cafe
de
bordeaux
at
the
corner
of
the
place
du
gouvernement
i
shall
be
there
monsieur
and
a
thousand
thanks
i
beg
you
as
a
favour
not
to
accompany
me
i
bear
and
drawing
a
great
white
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
he
wiped
his
eyes
blew
his
nose
and
disappeared
like
a
flash
through
the
door
which
i
held
open
for
him
i
went
down
to
dinner
in
a
chastened
mood
the
little
man
had
not
shown
me
before
the
pathetic
side
of
the
freak
life
by
asking
him
to
dinner
as
if
he
were
normal
i
had
earned
his
eternal
gratitude
and
yet
with
a
smile
which
i
trust
the
recording
angel
when
he
makes
up
my
final
of
good
and
evil
will
not
ascribe
to
an
unfeeling
heart
i
could
not
help
formulating
the
hope
that
his
gratitude
would
not
be
shown
by
presents
of
china
fowls
sitting
on
eggs
tyrolese
chalets
and
bottles
with
ladders
and
little
men
inside
them
i
did
not
feel
within
me
the
wide
charity
of
lola
brandt
and
i
could
not
repress
a
smile
as
i
ate
my
solitary
meal
at
the
perils
of
the
adventure
to
which
i
was
invited
i
had
no
doubt
that
it
bore
the
same
relation
to
danger
as
monsieur
saupiquet
bore
to
a
serious
debt
colonel
bunnion
a
genial
little
man
with
bulgy
eyes
and
a
moustache
too
big
for
his
body
who
sat
also
solitary
at
the
next
table
to
mine
suddenly
began
to
utter
words
which
i
discovered
were
addressed
to
me
most
amazing
thing
happened
to
me
as
i
was
coming
down
to
dinner
just
got
out
of
the
corridor
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
when
down
rushed
something
about
three
foot
nothing
in
a
devil
of
a
and
butted
me
full
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
bounded
off
like
a
football
when
i
picked
it
up
i
found
it
was
a
man
give
you
my
word
it
was
a
man
about
so
high
gave
me
quite
a
that
said
i
with
a
smile
was
my
friend
professor
anastasius
a
friend
of
yours
he
had
just
been
calling
on
then
i
wish
you
entreat
him
not
to
go
downstairs
like
a
shell
i
have
a
bruise
where
the
crown
of
his
hat
caught
me
as
big
as
a
i
offered
the
cheerily
indignant
warrior
apologies
for
my
parabolic
method
of
descent
and
suggested
elliman
embrocation
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
it
he
interrupted
was
that
when
i
picked
him
up
he
was
weeping
like
anything
what
was
he
crying
about
he
is
a
sensitive
creature
said
i
and
he
does
come
upon
the
pit
of
the
stomach
of
a
colonel
of
british
cavalry
every
day
in
the
he
sniffed
uncertainly
at
the
remark
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
broke
into
a
laugh
and
asked
me
to
play
bridge
after
dinner
on
the
two
preceding
evenings
he
and
i
had
attempted
to
cheer
in
this
manner
the
desolation
of
a
couple
of
the
elderly
maiden
ladies
but
i
may
say
parenthetically
that
as
he
played
bridge
as
if
he
were
leading
a
cavalry
charge
according
to
a
on
tactics
and
as
i
play
card
games
in
a
soft
mental
twilight
and
as
the
two
ladies
were
very
keen
bridge
players
indeed
i
had
great
doubts
as
to
the
success
of
our
attempts
i
sorry
said
i
but
i
going
down
into
the
town
theatre
if
so
i
go
with
the
gallant
gentleman
was
always
at
a
loose
end
unless
he
could
persuade
another
human
being
to
do
something
with
him
no
matter
what
he
would
joyfully
have
played
cat
cradle
with
me
by
the
hour
he
sat
in
awful
boredom
meditating
on
his
liver
i
not
going
to
the
theatre
i
said
and
i
wish
i
could
ask
you
to
accompany
me
on
my
the
colonel
raised
his
eyebrows
i
laughed
i
not
going
to
twang
guitars
under
the
colonel
reddened
and
swore
he
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
was
a
perjured
villain
but
i
did
not
tell
him
so
in
what
my
adventure
will
consist
i
ca
say
i
remarked
if
you
going
to
fool
about
algiers
at
night
you
better
carry
a
i
told
him
i
did
not
possess
such
deadly
weapons
he
offered
to
lend
me
one
the
two
misses
bostock
from
south
shields
who
sat
at
the
table
within
earshot
and
had
been
following
our
conversation
manifested
signs
of
excited
interest
i
shall
be
quite
protected
said
i
by
the
dynamic
qualities
of
your
acquaintance
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
with
whom
i
have
promised
to
spend
the
you
had
better
have
the
revolver
said
the
colonel
and
so
bent
was
he
on
the
point
that
after
dinner
he
came
to
me
in
the
lounge
and
laid
a
loaded
beside
my
the
younger
miss
bostock
grew
pale
it
looked
an
ugly
cumbrous
devastating
weapon
but
my
dear
colonel
i
protested
it
against
the
law
to
carry
law
what
law
why
the
law
of
france
said
i
this
staggered
him
the
fact
of
there
being
decent
laws
in
foreign
parts
has
staggered
many
an
honest
briton
he
counselled
a
damnation
of
the
law
and
finally
in
order
to
humour
him
i
allowed
him
to
thrust
the
uncomfortable
thing
into
my
colonel
said
i
when
i
took
leave
of
him
an
hour
later
i
have
armed
myself
out
of
pure
altruism
i
sha
be
able
to
sit
down
in
peace
and
comfort
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
should
i
accidentally
do
so
my
blood
will
be
on
your
chapter
xii
the
tram
that
passes
the
hotel
gates
took
me
into
the
town
and
dropped
me
at
the
place
du
gouvernement
with
its
strange
fusion
of
east
and
west
its
great
mosque
flanked
by
the
tall
minaret
contrasting
with
its
formal
french
colonnaded
facades
its
groupings
of
majestic
forms
and
commonplace
figures
in
caps
and
hard
felt
hats
the
mystery
of
its
palm
trees
and
the
crudity
of
its
flaring
electric
lights
it
gave
an
impression
of
unreality
of
a
modern
contractor
idea
of
fairyland
where
anything
grotesque
might
assume
an
air
of
normality
the
moon
shone
full
in
the
heavens
and
as
i
crossed
the
place
i
saw
the
equestrian
statue
of
the
duke
of
orleans
silhouetted
against
the
mosque
the
port
to
the
east
was
quiet
at
this
hour
and
the
shipping
lay
dreamily
in
the
moonlight
far
away
one
could
see
the
dim
outlines
of
the
kabyle
mountains
and
the
vague
melting
of
sea
and
sky
into
a
near
horizon
the
undefinable
smell
of
the
east
was
in
the
air
the
cafe
de
bordeaux
which
forms
an
angle
of
the
place
blazed
in
front
of
me
a
few
hardy
souls
a
zouave
or
two
an
arab
a
bored
englishman
and
his
wife
and
some
french
inhabitants
were
sitting
outside
in
the
chilliness
i
entered
the
cafe
was
filled
with
a
nondescript
crowd
and
the
rattle
of
dominoes
rose
above
the
hum
of
talk
in
a
corner
near
the
door
i
discovered
the
top
of
a
silk
hat
projecting
above
a
widely
opened
newspaper
grasped
by
two
pudgy
hands
and
i
recognised
the
professor
monsieur
said
he
when
i
had
taken
a
seat
at
his
table
if
the
unknown
terrors
which
you
are
going
to
confront
dismay
you
i
beg
that
you
will
not
consider
yourself
bound
to
my
dear
professor
i
replied
a
brave
man
tastes
of
death
but
he
was
much
delighted
at
the
sentiment
which
he
took
to
be
original
i
shall
quote
it
said
he
whenever
my
honour
or
my
courage
is
called
into
question
it
is
not
often
that
a
man
has
the
temerity
to
do
so
can
i
have
the
honour
of
offering
you
a
whisky
and
soda
have
we
time
i
asked
we
have
time
he
said
solemnly
consulting
his
watch
things
will
then
said
i
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
in
drinking
to
their
while
we
were
drinking
our
whisky
and
soda
he
talked
volubly
of
many
things
his
travels
his
cats
his
own
incredible
importance
in
the
cosmos
and
as
he
sat
there
vapouring
about
the
pathetically
insignificant
he
looked
more
like
napoleon
iii
than
ever
his
eyes
had
the
same
mournful
depths
his
features
the
same
stamp
of
fatality
each
man
has
his
gigantic
combinations
perhaps
equally
important
in
the
eyes
of
the
high
gods
i
was
filled
with
an
immense
pity
for
napoleon
iii
of
the
object
of
the
adventure
he
said
nothing
as
secrecy
seemed
to
be
a
vital
element
in
his
scheme
i
showed
no
embarrassing
curiosity
indeed
i
felt
but
little
though
i
was
certain
that
the
adventure
was
connected
with
the
revelations
of
monsieur
saupiquet
and
was
undertaken
in
the
interest
of
his
beloved
lady
lola
brandt
but
it
was
like
playing
at
pirates
with
a
child
and
my
pity
for
napoleon
gave
place
to
my
pity
for
my
valiant
but
childish
little
friend
at
last
he
looked
again
at
his
watch
the
hour
his
struck
let
us
instinctively
i
summoned
the
waiter
and
drew
a
coin
from
my
pocket
and
when
the
person
and
the
small
boy
hobnob
together
the
former
pays
but
anastasius
with
a
swift
look
of
protest
anticipated
my
intention
i
was
his
guest
for
the
evening
i
yielded
apologetically
the
score
was
paid
and
we
went
forth
into
the
moonlight
he
led
me
across
the
place
du
gouvernement
and
struck
straight
up
the
hill
past
the
cathedral
and
turning
plunged
into
a
network
of
narrow
streets
where
the
poor
of
all
races
lived
together
in
amity
and
evil
odours
shops
chiefly
occupied
the
ground
floors
some
were
the
ordinary
humble
shops
of
europeans
others
were
caves
lit
by
a
smoky
lamp
where
arabs
lounged
and
smoked
around
the
tailors
or
cobblers
squatting
at
their
work
others
were
jewish
with
hebrew
inscriptions
there
were
dark
arab
cafes
noisy
italian
butchers
stalls
children
of
all
ages
played
and
screamed
about
the
precipitous
streets
and
the
shrill
cries
of
jewish
women
sitting
at
their
doors
rose
in
rebuke
of
husband
or
offspring
not
many
lights
appeared
through
the
shuttered
windows
of
the
dark
high
houses
overhead
between
two
facades
one
saw
a
strip
of
paleness
which
one
knew
was
the
moonlit
sky
conversation
with
my
companion
being
difficult
the
top
of
his
silk
hat
just
reached
my
elbow
i
strode
along
in
silence
anastasius
trotting
by
my
side
many
jeers
and
jests
were
flung
at
us
as
we
passed
whereat
he
scowled
terribly
but
no
one
molested
us
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
anastasius
attributed
this
to
fear
of
his
fierce
demeanour
if
so
he
was
happy
as
were
the
simple
souls
who
flouted
and
this
reflection
kept
my
mind
serene
presently
we
turned
into
a
wide
and
less
street
which
i
felt
sure
we
could
have
reached
by
a
less
tortuous
and
malodorous
path
a
few
yards
down
we
came
to
a
dark
the
dwarf
halted
crossed
so
as
to
read
the
number
by
the
gas
lamp
and
joining
me
said
it
is
here
have
you
your
ready
i
nodded
we
proceeded
down
the
dark
entry
till
we
came
to
a
slovenly
glass
box
lit
by
a
small
gas
jet
whence
emerged
a
slovenly
man
this
was
the
concierge
anastasius
addressed
a
remark
to
him
which
i
did
not
catch
fond
de
la
cour
troisieme
a
said
the
concierge
as
yet
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
peculiarly
perilous
about
the
adventure
we
crossed
the
courtyard
and
mounted
an
stone
staircase
blackened
here
and
there
by
the
occasional
gas
jets
on
the
third
landing
we
halted
anastasius
put
up
his
hand
and
gripped
mine
two
strong
men
together
said
he
need
fear
i
confess
my
only
fear
was
lest
the
confounded
revolver
which
swung
insecurely
in
my
might
go
off
of
its
own
accord
i
did
not
mention
this
to
my
companion
he
raised
his
hat
wiped
his
brow
and
rang
the
bell
the
door
opened
about
six
inches
and
a
man
face
appeared
desirez
as
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
we
desired
i
let
anastasius
be
spokesman
here
is
an
english
milord
said
anastasius
boldly
who
would
like
to
be
admitted
for
the
evening
to
the
privileges
of
the
enter
gentlemen
said
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
the
porter
we
found
ourselves
in
a
small
vestibule
in
front
of
us
was
a
large
door
on
the
right
a
small
one
both
closed
at
a
table
by
the
large
door
sat
a
dirty
raven
of
a
man
reading
a
newspaper
the
latter
looked
up
and
addressed
me
you
wish
to
enter
the
club
monsieur
i
had
no
particular
longing
to
do
so
but
i
politely
answered
that
such
was
my
desire
if
you
will
give
your
i
will
submit
it
to
the
i
produced
my
card
anastasius
thrust
a
pencil
into
my
hand
write
my
name
on
it
i
obeyed
the
raven
sent
the
porter
with
the
card
into
the
room
on
the
right
and
resumed
the
perusal
of
his
soiled
newspaper
i
looked
at
anastasius
the
little
man
was
quivering
with
excitement
the
porter
returned
after
a
few
minutes
with
a
couple
of
pink
oval
cards
which
he
handed
to
each
of
us
i
glanced
at
mine
on
it
was
inscribed
africain
carte
de
member
honoraire
une
and
then
there
was
a
line
for
the
honorary
member
signature
the
raven
man
dipped
a
pen
in
the
in
front
of
him
and
handed
it
to
me
will
you
sign
messieurs
we
executed
this
formality
he
retained
the
cards
and
opening
the
great
door
said
the
door
closed
behind
us
it
was
simply
a
or
and
all
this
solemn
farce
of
secretariats
and
to
obtain
admission
it
is
curious
how
the
bureaucratic
instinct
is
ingrained
in
the
french
character
it
was
a
large
room
blue
with
cigarette
and
cigar
smoke
some
thirty
men
were
sitting
or
standing
around
a
baccarat
table
in
the
centre
and
two
or
three
groups
hung
around
tables
in
the
corners
a
personage
who
looked
like
a
slightly
more
prosperous
brother
of
the
raven
outside
and
wore
a
promenaded
the
room
with
the
air
of
one
in
authority
he
scrutinised
us
carefully
from
a
distance
then
advanced
and
greeted
us
politely
you
have
chosen
an
excellent
evening
said
he
there
are
a
great
many
people
and
the
banks
are
he
bowed
and
passed
on
a
dingy
waiter
took
our
hats
and
coats
and
hung
them
up
anastasius
plucked
me
by
the
sleeve
if
you
do
mind
staking
a
little
for
the
sake
of
appearances
i
shall
be
i
whispered
can
you
tell
me
now
my
dear
professor
for
what
reason
you
have
brought
me
to
this
he
looked
up
at
me
out
of
his
mournful
eyes
and
murmured
lieber
then
spying
a
vacant
place
behind
the
chairs
at
the
baccarat
table
he
darted
thither
and
i
followed
in
his
wake
there
must
have
been
about
a
couple
of
hundred
louis
in
the
bank
which
was
held
by
a
dissipated
man
who
having
once
been
handsome
in
a
fleshy
way
had
run
to
fat
his
black
hair
cropped
short
stood
up
like
a
shoebrush
and
when
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
a
roll
of
flesh
rose
above
his
collar
i
disliked
the
fellow
for
his
unhealthiness
and
for
the
hard
mockery
in
his
puffy
eyes
the
company
seemed
fairly
homogeneous
in
its
raffishness
though
here
and
there
appeared
a
thin
aristocratic
face
with
grey
moustache
and
pointed
beard
and
the
homely
anxious
visage
of
a
small
tradesman
but
in
bulk
it
looked
an
ugly
seedy
crowd
with
unwashed
bodies
and
unclean
souls
i
noticed
an
italian
or
two
and
a
villainous
englishman
with
a
face
like
that
of
a
dilapidated
horse
a
glance
at
the
table
plastered
with
silver
and
gold
showed
me
that
they
were
playing
with
a
minimum
anastasius
drew
a
handful
of
louis
from
his
pocket
and
staked
one
i
staked
a
piece
the
cards
were
dealt
the
banker
exposed
a
nine
the
highest
number
and
the
croupier
flat
spoon
swept
the
table
a
murmur
arose
the
banker
was
having
the
luck
of
satan
he
always
protects
me
the
good
fellow
laughed
the
banker
who
had
overheard
the
remark
again
we
staked
again
the
hands
were
dealt
our
tableau
or
end
of
the
table
won
the
other
lost
the
croupier
threw
the
coins
in
payment
i
let
my
double
stake
lie
and
so
did
anastasius
at
the
next
coup
we
lost
again
the
banker
stuffed
his
winnings
into
his
pocket
and
declared
a
the
bank
was
put
up
at
auction
and
was
eventually
knocked
down
to
the
same
personage
for
fifty
louis
the
englishman
cried
which
means
that
he
would
play
the
banker
for
the
whole
amount
the
hands
were
dealt
the
englishman
lost
and
the
game
started
afresh
with
a
hundred
louis
in
the
bank
the
proceedings
began
to
bore
me
even
if
my
experience
of
life
had
not
suggested
that
scrupulous
fairness
and
honour
were
not
the
guiding
principles
of
such
an
assemblage
i
should
have
taken
little
interest
in
the
game
i
am
a
great
believer
in
the
wholesomeness
of
compounding
for
sins
you
are
inclined
to
by
damning
those
you
have
no
mind
to
it
aids
the
nice
balance
of
life
and
gambling
is
one
of
the
sins
i
delight
to
damn
the
rapid
getting
of
money
has
never
appealed
to
me
who
have
always
had
sufficient
for
my
moderately
epicurean
needs
and
least
of
all
did
it
appeal
to
me
now
when
i
was
on
the
brink
of
my
journey
to
the
land
where
french
gold
and
bank
notes
were
not
in
currency
i
repeat
therefore
that
i
was
bored
if
the
perils
of
the
adventure
do
begin
soon
my
dear
professor
i
whispered
i
shall
go
to
sleep
again
he
asked
for
patience
and
staked
a
note
at
that
moment
the
man
sitting
at
the
table
in
front
of
him
rose
and
the
dwarf
slipped
swiftly
into
his
seat
he
won
his
hundred
francs
and
made
the
same
stake
again
it
was
obvious
that
the
little
man
did
not
damn
gambling
it
was
a
sin
to
which
he
appeared
peculiarly
inclined
the
true
inwardness
of
the
perilous
adventure
began
to
dawn
on
me
he
had
come
here
to
make
the
money
wherewith
he
could
further
his
gigantic
combinations
all
this
mystery
was
part
of
his
childish
cunning
i
hardly
knew
whether
to
box
the
little
creature
ears
to
box
my
own
or
to
laugh
i
compromised
with
a
smile
on
the
last
alternative
and
baccarat
being
a
dreary
game
to
watch
i
strolled
off
to
the
nearest
table
and
to
justify
my
presence
in
the
room
backed
one
of
the
players
presently
my
attention
was
called
to
the
baccarat
table
by
a
noise
as
of
some
dispute
and
turning
i
saw
the
gentleman
in
the
hurrying
to
what
appeared
to
be
the
storm
centre
the
place
where
anastasius
was
sitting
suspecting
some
minor
peril
i
left
the
players
and
joined
the
gentleman
in
the
it
seemed
that
the
hand
which
is
played
in
rotation
by
those
seated
at
each
tableau
or
had
come
round
for
the
first
time
to
anastasius
and
objection
had
been
taken
to
his
playing
it
on
the
score
of
his
physical
appearance
the
dwarf
was
protesting
vehemently
he
had
played
baccarat
in
all
the
clubs
of
europe
and
had
never
received
such
treatment
it
was
infamous
it
was
insulting
the
malcontents
of
the
punt
paid
little
heed
to
his
remonstrances
they
resented
the
entrusting
of
their
fortunes
to
one
whose
chin
barely
rose
above
the
level
of
the
table
the
banker
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
a
smile
of
mockery
his
attitude
brought
up
the
superfluous
flesh
about
his
chin
and
the
roll
of
fat
at
the
back
of
his
neck
with
his
moustache
and
his
shoebrush
hair
i
have
rarely
beheld
a
more
desperado
but
gentlemen
said
he
i
see
no
objection
whatever
to
monsieur
playing
the
naturally
retorted
a
voice
since
it
would
be
to
your
the
raven
in
the
commanded
silence
gentlemen
i
decide
that
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
monsieur
is
entitled
to
play
the
bravo
exclaimed
one
or
two
of
my
friend
supporters
growled
the
malcontents
faites
vos
cried
the
croupier
the
stakes
were
laid
the
banker
looked
around
estimating
the
comparative
values
of
the
two
tableaux
anastasius
had
backed
his
hand
with
a
pile
of
louis
to
encourage
him
and
to
conciliate
the
hostile
punt
i
threw
down
a
note
jeux
sont
faits
rien
ne
va
the
banker
dealt
two
cards
to
each
tableau
two
to
himself
anastasius
trembling
with
nervous
excitement
stretched
out
a
palsied
little
fist
towards
the
cards
he
drew
them
towards
him
face
downwards
peeped
at
them
in
the
most
approved
manner
and
in
a
husky
voice
called
for
an
extra
card
the
card
dealt
face
upwards
was
a
five
the
banker
turned
up
his
own
cards
a
two
and
a
four
making
a
point
of
six
naturally
he
stood
anastasius
did
nothing
show
your
cards
show
your
cards
cried
several
voices
he
turned
over
the
two
cards
originally
dealt
to
him
they
were
a
king
and
a
nine
making
the
natural
nine
the
highest
point
and
he
had
actually
asked
for
another
card
it
was
the
unforgivable
sin
the
five
that
had
been
dealt
to
him
brought
his
point
to
four
there
was
a
roar
of
indignation
men
with
violent
faces
rose
and
cursed
him
and
shook
their
fists
at
him
others
clamoured
that
the
coup
was
ineffective
they
were
not
going
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
an
idiot
who
knew
nothing
of
the
game
the
hand
must
be
dealt
over
again
de
la
shouted
the
banker
coup
est
cried
the
raven
in
authority
and
the
spoon
hovered
over
the
tableau
but
the
englishman
clutched
the
two
louis
he
had
staked
he
was
damned
and
a
great
many
other
things
if
he
would
lose
his
money
that
way
the
raven
in
the
darted
round
and
bending
over
him
caught
him
by
the
wrist
two
or
three
others
grabbed
their
stakes
and
swore
they
would
not
pay
the
banker
rose
and
went
to
the
rescue
of
his
gains
there
was
screaming
and
shouting
and
struggling
and
riot
indescribable
those
round
about
us
went
on
cursing
anastasius
who
sat
quite
still
with
quivering
lips
as
helpless
as
a
rabbit
the
raven
tore
his
way
through
the
throng
around
the
englishman
and
came
up
to
me
excited
and
dishevelled
it
is
all
your
fault
monsieur
he
shrieked
for
introducing
into
the
club
a
creature
like
yes
it
your
fault
cried
a
ugly
fellow
looking
like
a
butcher
in
uneasy
circumstances
who
stood
next
to
me
suddenly
the
avalanche
of
indignation
fell
upon
my
head
angry
ugly
men
crowded
round
me
and
began
to
curse
me
instead
of
the
dwarf
cries
arose
the
adventure
began
indeed
to
grow
idiotically
perilous
i
had
never
been
thrown
out
of
doors
in
my
life
i
objected
strongly
to
the
idea
it
might
possibly
hurt
my
body
and
would
certainly
offend
my
dignity
i
felt
that
i
could
not
make
my
exit
through
the
portals
of
life
with
the
urbanity
on
which
i
had
counted
if
as
a
preparatory
step
i
had
been
thrown
out
of
a
there
were
only
two
things
to
be
done
either
i
must
whip
out
my
ridiculous
revolver
and
do
some
free
shooting
or
i
must
make
an
appeal
to
the
lower
feelings
of
the
assembly
i
chose
the
latter
alternative
with
a
sudden
movement
i
slipped
through
the
angry
and
gesticulating
crowd
and
leaped
on
a
chair
by
one
of
the
deserted
tables
then
i
raised
a
commanding
arm
and
in
my
best
voice
i
cried
the
unexpectedness
of
the
manoeuvre
caused
instant
silence
as
my
friend
and
myself
i
said
are
the
cause
of
this
unpleasant
confusion
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
pay
the
banker
the
losses
of
the
and
i
drew
out
and
brandished
my
in
which
by
a
special
grace
of
providence
there
happened
to
be
a
considerable
sum
of
money
murmurs
of
approbation
arose
then
the
englishman
sang
out
but
what
about
the
money
we
would
have
won
if
that
little
fool
had
played
the
game
properly
the
remark
was
received
with
cheers
that
amount
too
said
i
i
shall
be
happy
to
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
as
everybody
banker
and
punt
were
satisfied
the
raven
in
the
came
up
and
informed
me
that
my
proposal
solved
the
difficulty
i
besought
him
to
make
out
the
bill
for
my
little
entertainment
as
quickly
as
possible
then
i
dismounted
from
my
chair
and
beckoned
to
the
dwarf
still
sitting
white
and
piteous
to
join
me
he
obeyed
like
a
frightened
child
who
had
been
naughty
all
his
swagger
and
braggadocio
were
gone
his
bosom
heaved
with
suppressed
sobs
he
sat
down
on
the
chair
i
had
vacated
and
buried
his
face
on
the
table
we
remained
thus
aloof
from
the
crowd
who
were
intent
on
the
calculation
at
the
baccarat
table
at
last
the
raven
in
the
arrived
with
a
note
of
the
amount
it
was
two
thousand
three
hundred
francs
i
gave
him
the
notes
and
taking
anastasius
by
the
arm
led
him
to
the
door
where
the
waiter
stood
with
our
hats
and
coats
before
we
could
reach
it
however
the
banker
who
had
risen
from
his
seat
crossed
the
room
and
addressed
me
monsieur
said
he
with
an
air
of
courtesy
i
infinitely
regret
this
unpleasant
affair
and
i
thank
you
for
your
perfect
i
did
not
suggest
that
with
equal
magnanimity
he
might
refund
the
pounds
that
had
found
its
way
from
my
pocket
to
his
but
i
bowed
with
stiff
politeness
and
made
my
exit
with
as
much
dignity
as
the
attachment
to
my
heels
of
the
crestfallen
anastasius
would
permit
outside
i
constituted
myself
the
guide
and
took
the
first
turning
downhill
knowing
that
it
would
lead
to
the
civilised
centre
of
the
town
the
dwarf
roundabout
route
was
characteristic
of
his
tortuous
mind
we
walked
along
for
some
time
without
saying
anything
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
reproach
the
little
man
for
the
expensiveness
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
of
his
perilous
adventure
and
he
seemed
too
dazed
with
shame
and
humiliation
to
speak
at
last
when
we
reached
as
i
anticipated
the
square
de
la
republique
i
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
cheer
up
my
dear
professor
said
i
we
both
are
acquainted
with
nobler
things
than
the
ins
and
outs
of
he
reeled
to
a
bench
under
the
palm
trees
and
bursting
into
tears
gave
vent
to
his
misery
in
the
most
incoherent
language
ever
uttered
by
man
i
sat
beside
him
and
vainly
attempted
consolation
ah
how
mad
i
am
ah
how
contemptible
i
dare
not
face
my
beautiful
cats
again
i
dare
not
see
the
light
of
the
sun
i
have
betrayed
my
trust
accursed
be
the
cards
i
who
had
my
gigantic
combination
it
is
all
gone
beautiful
lady
forgive
me
friend
forgive
me
i
am
the
most
miserable
of
god
it
is
an
accident
that
might
happen
to
any
one
i
said
gently
you
were
nervous
you
looked
at
the
cards
you
mistook
the
nine
for
a
ten
in
which
case
you
were
right
to
call
for
another
it
is
not
that
he
wailed
it
is
the
spoiling
of
my
combination
on
which
i
have
wasted
sleepless
nights
a
curse
on
my
mad
folly
do
you
know
who
the
banker
was
no
said
i
he
was
captain
vauvenarde
the
husband
of
madame
chapter
xiii
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
it
is
a
trite
metaphor
i
know
but
it
is
none
the
less
excellent
i
repeat
therefore
unblushingly
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
i
gasped
the
little
man
wiped
his
eyes
he
was
the
tearfullest
adult
i
have
ever
met
and
i
once
knew
an
italian
with
a
temperament
captain
vauvenarde
the
man
with
the
shoebrush
hair
and
the
rolls
of
fat
at
the
back
of
his
neck
are
you
sure
the
dwarf
nodded
i
set
out
from
england
to
find
him
i
swore
to
the
that
i
would
do
so
i
have
done
it
he
added
with
a
faint
return
of
his
well
i
damned
said
i
in
my
native
tongue
i
do
often
use
strong
language
but
the
occasion
warranted
it
i
was
flabbergasted
bewildered
humiliated
delighted
incredulous
and
generally
turned
in
conversation
one
has
no
time
for
so
minute
an
analysis
of
one
feelings
i
therefore
summed
them
up
in
the
only
word
captain
vauvenarde
the
wild
goose
of
my
absurd
chase
found
by
this
flibbertigibbet
of
a
fellow
while
i
simon
de
gex
erstwhile
was
fooling
about
war
offices
and
regiments
it
was
grotesque
it
was
monstrous
it
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
and
yet
it
saved
me
a
vast
amount
of
trouble
i
damned
said
anastasius
had
just
enough
english
to
understand
i
suppose
such
is
mortal
unregeneracy
that
it
is
the
most
widely
understood
word
in
the
universe
and
i
said
he
am
eternally
beaten
i
am
trampled
under
foot
and
shall
never
be
able
to
hold
up
my
head
whereupon
he
renewed
his
lamentations
for
some
time
i
listened
patiently
and
from
his
disconnected
remarks
i
gathered
that
he
had
gone
to
the
cercle
africain
in
view
of
his
gigantic
combinations
but
that
the
demon
of
gambling
taking
possession
of
him
had
almost
driven
them
from
his
mind
eventually
he
had
lost
control
of
his
nerves
a
cloud
had
spread
over
his
brain
and
he
had
committed
the
unspeakable
blunder
which
led
to
disaster
to
think
that
i
should
have
tracked
him
down
for
this
he
exclaimed
tragically
what
beats
me
i
cried
is
how
the
deuce
you
managed
to
track
him
down
your
magnificent
intellect
i
suppose
i
spoke
gently
and
not
in
open
sarcasm
enabled
you
to
get
on
the
he
brightened
at
the
compliment
yes
that
was
it
listen
i
came
to
algiers
the
last
place
he
was
heard
of
i
go
to
the
cafes
i
listen
like
a
detective
to
conversation
i
creep
behind
soldiers
talking
i
find
out
nothing
i
ask
at
the
shops
they
think
i
am
crazy
but
anastasius
papadopoulos
has
a
brain
larger
than
theirs
i
go
to
my
old
friend
the
secretary
of
the
theatre
where
i
have
exhibited
the
marvellous
performance
of
my
cats
i
say
to
him
have
you
a
date
for
me
he
says
year
i
make
a
note
of
it
we
talk
he
knows
all
algiers
i
say
to
him
has
become
of
captain
vauvenarde
of
the
chasseurs
i
say
it
carelessly
as
if
the
captain
were
an
old
friend
of
mine
the
secretary
laughs
you
heard
the
captain
was
chased
from
the
regiment
the
deuce
he
was
i
interjected
on
account
of
something
said
anastasius
the
secretary
could
not
tell
what
perhaps
he
cheated
at
cards
the
officers
said
so
is
he
now
i
ask
in
algiers
he
is
the
most
famous
gambler
in
the
town
he
is
every
night
at
the
cercle
africain
and
some
people
believe
that
it
belongs
to
him
my
friend
the
secretary
asks
me
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
discover
captain
vauvenarde
i
do
not
betray
my
secret
when
i
do
not
wish
to
talk
i
close
my
lips
and
they
are
sealed
like
the
tomb
i
am
the
model
of
discretion
you
monsieur
with
the
delicacy
of
the
english
statesman
have
not
questioned
me
about
my
combination
i
appreciate
it
but
if
you
had
though
it
broke
my
heart
i
should
not
have
i
am
not
going
to
pry
into
your
schemes
i
said
but
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
must
understand
how
do
you
know
the
banker
was
captain
vauvenarde
i
saw
him
several
times
in
marseilles
with
the
then
how
was
it
he
did
not
recognise
you
i
was
then
but
an
acquaintance
of
madame
not
her
intimate
friend
counsellor
champion
as
i
am
now
i
did
not
have
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
captain
vauvenarde
i
went
to
make
sure
of
my
man
to
play
the
first
card
in
my
gigantic
combination
but
alas
but
no
he
rose
and
thumped
his
little
chest
i
feel
my
courage
coming
back
my
will
is
stiffening
into
iron
when
the
arrives
in
algiers
she
will
find
she
has
a
champion
how
do
you
know
she
is
coming
to
algiers
i
asked
startled
as
soon
as
i
learned
that
captain
vauvenarde
was
here
he
replied
proudly
i
sent
her
a
telegram
found
come
at
once
i
know
she
is
coming
for
she
has
not
an
idea
occurred
to
me
did
you
sign
your
name
and
address
on
the
telegram
he
approached
me
confidentially
as
i
sat
and
wagged
a
cunning
finger
in
matters
of
life
and
death
never
give
your
name
and
as
professor
anastasius
papadopoulos
was
himself
again
and
as
i
began
to
sneeze
for
the
night
was
chilly
i
rose
and
suggested
that
we
might
adjourn
this
conference
till
the
morrow
he
acquiesced
saying
that
all
was
not
lost
and
that
he
still
had
time
to
mature
his
combinations
we
crossed
the
road
and
i
hailed
a
cab
standing
by
the
cafe
i
offered
anastasius
to
drive
him
to
his
hotel
but
he
declined
politely
we
shook
hands
monsieur
said
he
i
have
to
make
my
heartfelt
apologies
for
having
caused
you
so
painful
so
useless
and
so
expensive
an
evening
as
for
the
last
aspect
i
will
repay
you
will
do
no
such
thing
professor
said
i
my
evening
has
on
the
contrary
been
particularly
useful
and
instructive
i
would
have
missed
it
for
the
and
i
drove
off
homewards
glad
to
be
in
my
own
company
here
was
an
imbroglio
the
missing
husband
found
and
like
most
missing
husbands
found
to
be
entirely
undesirable
and
lola
obviously
imagining
her
summons
to
be
from
me
was
at
that
moment
speeding
hither
as
fast
as
the
could
carry
her
if
i
had
discovered
captain
vauvenarde
instead
of
anastasius
i
would
have
anathematised
him
as
the
most
meddlesome
crazy
little
marplot
that
ever
looked
like
napoleon
the
third
but
as
the
credit
of
the
discovery
belonged
to
him
and
not
to
me
i
could
only
anathematise
myself
for
my
dilettanteism
in
the
capacity
of
a
private
inquiry
agent
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
badly
the
ludicrous
scenes
of
the
evening
danced
before
my
eyes
the
sordid
room
the
ignoble
faces
round
the
table
the
foolish
hullaballoo
the
collapse
of
anastasius
my
melodramatic
intervention
and
the
ironical
courtesy
of
the
fleshy
captain
vauvenarde
also
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
gigantic
combinations
assumed
a
less
trivial
aspect
what
lunatic
scheme
was
being
hatched
behind
that
brow
his
object
in
taking
me
to
the
club
was
obvious
he
could
not
have
got
in
save
under
my
protection
but
what
he
had
reckoned
upon
doing
when
he
got
there
heaven
and
anastasius
papadopoulos
only
knew
i
was
also
worried
by
the
confounded
little
pain
inside
on
the
following
afternoon
i
went
down
to
meet
the
steamer
from
marseilles
i
more
than
expected
to
find
the
dwarf
on
the
quay
but
to
my
relief
he
was
not
there
i
had
purposely
kept
my
knowledge
of
movements
a
secret
from
him
as
i
desired
as
far
as
possible
to
conduct
affairs
without
his
crazy
intervention
i
was
not
sorry
too
that
he
had
not
availed
himself
of
my
proposal
to
visit
me
that
morning
and
continue
our
conversation
of
the
night
before
the
grotesque
as
a
decoration
of
life
is
valuable
as
the
main
feature
it
gets
on
your
nerves
i
stood
on
the
sloping
stone
jetty
among
the
crowd
of
arab
porters
and
europeans
and
watched
the
vessel
waddle
in
lola
and
i
catching
sight
of
each
other
at
the
same
time
waved
handkerchiefs
in
an
imbecile
manner
and
when
the
vessel
came
alongside
and
during
the
tedious
process
of
mooring
we
regarded
each
other
with
photographic
smiles
she
was
wearing
a
squirrel
coat
and
a
toque
of
the
same
fur
and
she
looked
more
like
a
splendid
wild
animal
than
ever
something
inside
me
not
the
little
pain
but
what
must
have
been
my
heart
throbbed
suddenly
at
her
beauty
and
the
throb
was
followed
by
a
sudden
sense
of
shock
at
the
realisation
of
my
keen
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
her
a
wistful
radiance
shone
in
her
face
as
she
came
down
the
gangway
oh
how
kind
how
good
how
splendid
of
you
to
meet
me
she
cried
as
our
hands
clasped
i
was
dreading
dreading
dreading
that
it
might
be
some
one
and
yet
you
came
straight
through
said
i
still
holding
her
hand
or
rather
allowing
hers
to
encircle
mine
in
the
familiar
grip
did
you
command
me
to
do
so
i
could
not
explain
matters
to
her
then
and
there
among
the
hustle
of
passengers
and
the
bustle
of
porters
besides
rogers
who
had
come
down
with
the
hotel
omnibus
was
at
my
side
touching
his
hat
i
have
ordered
you
a
room
and
a
private
with
a
balcony
facing
the
sea
put
yourself
in
charge
of
me
and
your
luggage
in
charge
of
rogers
and
dismiss
all
thoughts
of
worry
from
your
you
are
so
restful
she
laughed
as
we
moved
off
then
she
scanned
my
face
and
said
falteringly
how
thin
and
worn
you
look
are
you
worse
if
you
ask
me
such
questions
said
i
i
leave
you
with
the
luggage
in
charge
of
rogers
i
am
in
resplendent
she
murmured
that
she
wished
she
could
believe
me
and
took
my
arm
as
we
walked
down
the
jetty
to
the
waiting
cab
it
good
to
hear
your
voice
again
i
said
it
a
lazy
voice
and
fits
in
with
the
lazy
i
pointed
to
the
arabs
sleeping
on
the
parapet
it
out
of
place
in
cadogan
she
laughed
her
low
rippling
laugh
it
was
music
very
pleasant
to
hear
after
the
somewhat
shrill
cachinnation
of
the
misses
bostock
of
south
shields
i
was
so
pleased
that
i
gave
half
a
franc
to
a
pestilential
arab
shoeblack
that
was
nice
of
you
she
said
it
was
the
act
of
an
imbecile
i
retorted
i
have
now
rendered
it
impossible
for
me
to
enter
the
town
again
how
is
dale
she
started
he
well
busy
with
his
election
i
saw
him
the
day
before
i
left
i
did
tell
him
i
was
coming
to
algiers
i
wrote
from
telling
him
the
reason
she
faced
me
and
met
my
eyes
and
said
shortly
oh
said
i
this
brought
us
to
the
cab
we
entered
and
drove
away
then
leaning
back
and
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
she
grasped
my
wrist
and
said
now
my
dear
friend
tell
me
all
and
get
it
my
dear
madame
brandt
i
began
she
interrupted
me
for
goodness
sake
do
call
me
that
it
makes
a
cold
shiver
run
down
my
back
i
either
lola
to
you
or
then
my
dear
lola
said
i
the
first
thing
i
must
tell
you
is
that
i
did
not
send
for
what
do
you
mean
the
telegram
it
was
sent
by
anastasius
anastasius
she
bent
forward
and
looked
at
me
what
is
he
doing
here
heaven
knows
said
i
but
what
he
has
done
has
been
to
find
captain
vauvenarde
i
am
glad
he
has
done
that
but
i
am
deeply
sorry
he
sent
you
the
sorry
why
because
there
was
no
reason
for
your
coming
i
said
with
unwonted
gravity
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
stayed
in
london
and
it
will
be
best
if
you
take
the
boat
back
again
she
remained
silent
for
a
while
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
wo
have
me
he
has
been
asked
i
said
he
will
as
far
as
i
can
command
the
situation
never
be
on
that
i
had
fully
determined
and
when
she
inquired
the
reason
i
told
her
i
proposed
that
you
should
reunite
yourself
with
an
honourable
though
somewhat
misguided
gentleman
i
had
the
reverse
of
pleasure
in
meeting
captain
vauvenarde
and
i
regret
to
say
though
he
is
still
misguided
he
can
scarcely
be
termed
honourable
the
term
has
still
to
be
accurately
she
made
a
writhing
movement
of
impatience
tell
me
straight
out
what
he
doing
in
algiers
you
trying
to
make
things
easy
for
me
it
the
way
of
your
class
it
is
the
way
of
mine
i
used
to
brutality
i
like
it
better
why
did
he
leave
the
army
and
why
is
he
in
algiers
if
you
prefer
the
direct
method
my
dear
lola
said
i
and
the
name
came
quite
trippingly
on
my
tongue
i
employ
it
your
husband
has
apparently
been
kicked
out
of
the
army
and
is
now
running
a
she
took
the
blow
bravely
but
it
turned
her
face
haggard
like
a
paroxysm
of
physical
pain
after
a
few
moments
silence
she
said
it
must
have
been
awful
for
him
he
was
a
proud
he
is
changed
i
replied
gently
pride
is
too
hampering
a
quality
for
a
knight
of
industry
to
keep
in
his
tell
me
how
you
met
him
she
said
i
rapidly
sketched
the
whole
absurd
history
from
my
encounter
with
anastasius
papadopoulos
in
marseilles
to
my
parting
with
him
on
the
previous
night
i
softened
down
as
much
as
i
could
the
fleshiness
of
captain
vauvenarde
and
the
rolls
of
fat
at
the
back
of
his
neck
but
i
portrayed
the
villainous
physiognomies
of
his
associates
very
neatly
i
concluded
by
repeating
my
assertion
that
our
project
had
proved
itself
to
be
abortive
he
must
be
pretty
miserable
said
lola
devil
a
bit
said
i
she
did
not
answer
but
settled
herself
more
comfortably
in
the
carriage
and
relapsed
into
mournful
silence
i
having
said
my
say
lit
a
cigarette
save
for
the
clanging
past
of
an
upward
or
downward
tram
the
creeping
drive
up
the
hill
through
the
long
winding
street
was
very
quiet
and
as
we
mounted
higher
and
left
the
shops
behind
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
afternoon
stillness
were
the
driver
raucous
admonition
to
his
horses
and
the
wind
in
the
trees
by
the
wayside
at
different
points
the
turns
of
the
road
brought
to
view
the
panorama
of
the
town
below
and
the
calm
sweep
of
the
bay
exquisite
is
it
i
said
at
last
with
an
indicative
wave
of
the
hand
what
the
good
of
anything
being
exquisite
when
you
feel
mouldy
it
may
help
to
charm
away
the
mouldiness
beauty
is
eternal
and
mouldiness
only
temporal
the
sun
will
go
on
shining
and
the
sea
will
go
on
changing
colour
long
after
our
pains
and
joys
have
vanished
from
the
world
nature
is
pitilessly
indifferent
to
human
if
so
she
said
her
intuition
finding
the
weakness
of
my
slipshod
argument
how
can
it
touch
human
mouldiness
i
do
know
said
i
the
poets
will
tell
you
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
lie
on
the
breast
of
the
great
mother
and
your
heartache
will
go
from
you
i
never
tried
it
myself
as
i
never
been
afflicted
with
is
that
true
she
asked
womanlike
catching
at
the
personal
i
smiled
and
nodded
i
glad
on
your
account
she
said
sincerely
it
the
very
devil
of
an
ache
i
always
had
poor
lola
said
i
prompted
by
my
acquired
instinct
of
eumoiriety
i
wish
i
could
cure
you
she
gave
a
short
little
laugh
and
then
turned
her
head
away
i
had
a
very
comfortable
crossing
she
remarked
a
moment
later
i
gave
her
into
the
keeping
of
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
did
not
see
her
again
until
she
came
down
somewhat
late
for
dinner
i
met
her
in
the
vestibule
she
wore
a
closely
fitting
brown
dress
which
in
colour
matched
the
bronze
of
her
hair
and
in
shape
showed
off
her
lithe
and
generous
figure
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
cheer
her
by
a
compliment
are
you
aware
i
said
with
a
low
bow
that
you
a
remarkably
handsome
woman
a
perfectly
unnecessary
light
came
into
her
eyes
and
a
superfluous
flush
to
her
cheeks
if
i
at
least
that
to
you
i
happy
she
said
you
that
to
the
dullest
vision
follow
the
said
i
as
we
entered
the
a
and
i
walk
behind
in
reflected
we
made
an
effective
entrance
i
declare
there
was
a
perceptible
rattle
of
laid
down
by
the
retired
colonels
and
maiden
ladies
as
we
passed
by
colonel
bunnion
returned
my
nod
of
greeting
in
the
most
distracted
fashion
and
gazed
at
lola
with
the
frank
admiration
of
british
cavalry
i
felt
foolishly
proud
and
exhilarated
and
gave
her
at
my
table
the
seat
commanding
a
view
of
the
room
i
then
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
which
i
am
forbidden
to
touch
it
is
often
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
you
i
said
by
way
of
apology
this
is
the
very
first
time
she
said
and
it
not
going
to
be
the
last
i
declared
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ship
me
back
to
marseilles
she
laughed
lazily
meeting
my
eyes
i
smiled
it
would
be
inhuman
i
allow
you
a
few
day
indeed
now
she
was
here
i
had
a
curious
desire
to
keep
her
i
regarded
the
failure
of
my
eumoirous
little
plans
with
more
than
satisfaction
i
had
done
my
best
i
had
found
through
the
dwarf
agency
captain
vauvenarde
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
he
was
an
outrageous
person
thoroughly
disqualified
from
becoming
lola
husband
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
meanwhile
fate
again
through
the
agency
of
anastasius
had
brought
her
many
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
dale
and
had
moreover
brought
her
to
me
i
was
delighted
i
patted
destiny
on
the
back
and
drank
his
health
in
excellent
pommery
lola
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
i
meant
but
she
smiled
amiably
and
drank
the
toast
it
was
quite
a
merry
dinner
lola
threw
herself
into
my
mood
and
jested
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
an
undesirable
husband
who
had
been
kicked
out
of
the
french
army
we
talked
of
many
things
i
described
in
fuller
detail
my
adventure
with
anastasius
and
saupiquet
and
we
laughed
over
the
debt
of
fifteen
sous
and
the
elaborate
receipt
anastasius
she
said
is
childish
in
many
ways
the
doctors
have
a
name
for
arrested
that
it
but
he
is
absolutely
cracked
on
one
point
the
poisoning
of
my
horse
sultan
he
has
reams
of
paper
which
he
calls
the
dossier
of
the
crime
you
never
saw
such
a
collection
of
rubbish
in
your
life
i
cried
over
it
and
he
is
so
proud
of
it
poor
wee
she
laughed
suddenly
i
should
love
to
have
seen
you
hobnobbing
with
him
and
why
you
so
she
did
me
the
embarrassing
honour
to
explain
in
her
direct
fashion
you
my
idea
of
an
english
my
dear
lola
i
replied
you
quite
wrong
the
ordinary
english
duke
is
a
stout
gentleman
with
a
beard
and
he
generally
wears
thick
knickerbockers
and
shocking
bad
do
you
know
any
two
or
three
i
admitted
and
duchesses
too
i
again
pleaded
guilty
in
these
democratic
days
if
one
is
engaged
in
public
and
social
affairs
one
ca
help
running
up
against
them
it
is
their
fault
not
mine
do
tell
me
about
them
said
lola
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
i
told
her
and
are
earls
and
countesses
just
the
same
she
asked
with
a
disappointed
air
just
the
same
only
worse
they
so
ordinary
you
ca
pick
them
out
from
common
misters
and
saying
this
i
rose
for
we
had
finished
our
dessert
and
proposed
coffee
in
the
lounge
there
we
found
colonel
bunnion
at
so
wilful
a
loose
end
that
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
refuse
him
an
introduction
to
lola
he
manifested
his
delight
by
lifting
the
skirt
of
his
with
his
hands
and
rising
on
his
spurs
like
a
bantam
cock
i
left
her
to
him
for
a
moment
and
went
over
to
say
a
civil
word
to
the
misses
bostock
of
south
shields
i
regret
to
say
i
noticed
a
certain
frigidity
in
their
demeanour
the
man
in
south
shields
does
not
go
out
one
night
with
a
revolver
tucked
away
in
the
pocket
of
his
and
turn
up
the
next
evening
with
a
lady
with
bronze
hair
such
are
seen
on
the
stage
in
south
shields
in
melodrama
and
they
are
the
of
the
villain
in
the
eyes
of
the
gentle
ladies
my
reputation
was
gone
i
was
trying
to
rehabilitate
myself
when
the
chasseur
brought
me
a
telegram
i
asked
permission
to
open
it
and
stepped
aside
the
words
of
the
telegram
were
like
a
ringing
box
on
the
ears
tell
me
immediately
why
lola
has
joined
you
in
algiers
not
dale
mark
you
as
he
has
signed
himself
ever
since
i
knew
him
in
eton
collars
but
why
has
lola
joined
you
why
have
you
run
off
with
lola
what
the
reason
of
this
treacherous
abduction
account
for
yourself
immediately
stand
and
deliver
i
stood
there
gaping
at
the
words
like
an
idiot
my
blood
tingling
at
the
implied
accusation
the
peremptoriness
of
it
the
impudence
of
the
boy
the
wild
extravagance
of
the
idea
and
yet
while
my
head
was
reeling
with
one
buffet
a
memory
arose
and
gave
me
another
on
the
other
side
i
remembered
the
preposterous
attitude
in
which
dale
had
found
us
when
he
rushed
from
berlin
into
lola
i
took
the
confounded
telegram
into
a
remote
corner
of
the
lounge
like
a
dog
with
a
bone
and
growled
over
it
for
a
time
until
the
humour
of
the
situation
turned
the
growl
into
a
chuckle
even
had
i
been
in
sound
health
and
strength
the
idea
of
running
off
with
lola
would
have
been
absurd
but
for
me
in
my
present
eumoirous
disposition
of
mind
for
me
a
spirit
who
had
cast
all
vain
and
disturbing
human
emotions
into
the
mud
of
for
me
who
had
a
calm
disregard
for
the
petty
passions
and
interests
of
mankind
and
walked
through
the
world
with
no
other
object
than
healing
a
few
human
woes
for
me
who
already
saw
death
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
found
serious
occupation
in
exchanging
airy
badinage
with
him
for
me
with
an
abominable
little
pain
inside
inexorably
eating
my
life
out
and
wasting
me
away
literally
and
perceptibly
like
a
shadow
and
twisting
me
up
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
in
excruciating
agony
for
me
in
this
delectable
condition
of
soul
and
this
deplorable
condition
of
body
to
think
of
running
hundreds
of
miles
from
home
with
to
say
the
least
of
it
so
inconvenient
a
creature
as
a
big
woman
the
idea
was
inexpressibly
and
weirdly
comic
i
stepped
into
the
close
by
and
drew
up
a
telegram
to
dale
lady
summoned
by
papadopoulos
on
private
affairs
avoid
lunacy
save
for
electioneering
then
i
joined
lola
and
colonel
bunnion
she
was
lying
back
in
her
laziest
and
most
pantherine
attitude
and
she
looked
up
at
me
as
i
approached
with
eyes
full
of
velvet
softness
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
feeling
glad
that
they
were
turned
on
me
and
not
on
dale
kynnersley
almost
immediately
the
elder
miss
bostock
came
up
to
claim
the
colonel
for
bridge
he
rose
reluctantly
i
suppose
it
no
use
asking
you
to
make
a
fourth
de
gex
she
asked
after
the
subacid
manner
of
her
kind
i
afraid
not
i
replied
sweetly
whereupon
she
rescued
the
colonel
from
the
syren
and
left
me
alone
with
her
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
by
her
side
as
she
did
not
stir
or
speak
i
asked
whether
she
was
tired
not
very
i
thinking
do
you
know
you
taught
me
an
awful
lot
i
what
can
i
have
taught
you
the
way
people
like
yourself
look
at
things
i
treating
dale
abominably
i
did
realise
it
now
why
on
earth
did
she
bring
dale
in
just
at
that
moment
indeed
said
i
she
nodded
her
head
and
said
in
her
languorous
voice
he
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
me
and
thinks
i
care
for
him
i
do
i
do
care
a
brass
button
for
him
i
a
bad
influence
in
his
life
and
the
sooner
i
take
myself
out
of
it
the
better
do
you
think
so
you
know
my
opinions
i
said
if
i
had
followed
your
advice
at
first
she
continued
we
have
had
all
this
commotion
and
yet
i
not
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
asked
before
deciding
i
shall
see
my
you
shall
do
no
such
she
smiled
i
i
protested
captain
vauvenarde
had
put
himself
outside
the
pale
he
was
not
fit
to
associate
with
decent
women
what
object
could
she
have
in
meeting
him
i
want
to
judge
for
myself
she
replied
judge
what
surely
not
whether
he
is
eligible
as
a
husband
yes
she
said
but
my
dear
lola
i
cried
the
notion
is
as
crazy
as
any
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
of
course
as
soon
as
he
learns
that
a
rich
woman
he
want
to
live
with
you
and
use
your
money
for
his
i
am
going
to
meet
him
she
said
quietly
i
forbid
you
too
late
dear
friend
i
wrote
him
a
letter
before
dinner
and
sent
it
to
the
cercle
africain
by
special
messenger
i
also
wrote
to
anastasius
i
asked
them
both
to
see
me
morning
that
why
i
been
so
gay
this
at
the
sight
of
my
blank
face
she
laughed
and
with
one
of
her
movements
rose
from
her
chair
i
rose
too
are
you
angry
with
me
i
thought
i
had
walked
out
of
a
nightmare
i
said
i
find
i
still
in
but
do
be
angry
with
me
it
was
the
only
the
only
way
to
or
out
of
what
i
asked
bewildered
never
she
looked
at
me
with
a
singular
expression
in
her
slumbrous
eyes
it
was
sad
wistful
soothing
and
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
noble
woman
making
a
senseless
sacrifice
there
is
no
earthly
reason
to
do
this
on
account
of
dale
i
protested
dale
has
nothing
to
do
with
then
who
has
anastasius
papadopoulos
she
said
with
undisguised
irony
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
rather
stiffly
for
appearing
to
force
your
confidence
but
as
i
first
put
the
idea
of
joining
your
husband
into
your
head
and
have
enjoyed
your
confidence
in
the
matter
hitherto
i
thought
i
might
claim
certain
as
she
had
done
before
she
laid
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
we
were
alone
in
the
alcove
and
looked
me
in
the
eyes
do
make
me
cry
i
very
near
it
and
i
tired
and
i
going
to
have
a
hellish
time
and
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
what
is
that
when
i
seeing
my
husband
i
like
to
know
that
you
were
within
call
in
case
i
wanted
you
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
you
will
come
wo
you
if
i
send
for
you
i
always
at
your
service
i
said
she
released
my
shoulders
and
grasped
my
hand
she
said
abruptly
and
rushed
swiftly
out
of
the
room
leaving
me
wondering
more
than
i
had
ever
wondered
in
my
life
at
the
inscrutable
ways
of
women
chapter
xiv
i
am
glad
i
devoted
last
night
and
the
past
hour
this
morning
to
bringing
up
to
date
this
trivial
record
for
i
have
a
premonition
that
the
time
is
rapidly
approaching
when
i
shall
no
longer
have
the
strength
of
will
or
body
to
continue
it
the
little
pain
has
increased
in
intensity
and
frequency
the
last
few
days
and
though
i
try
to
delude
myself
into
the
belief
that
otherwise
i
am
as
strong
as
ever
i
know
in
my
heart
that
i
am
daily
growing
weaker
daily
losing
vitality
i
shall
soon
have
to
call
in
a
doctor
to
give
me
some
temporary
relief
and
doubtless
he
will
put
me
to
bed
feed
me
on
slops
cut
off
alcohol
forbid
noise
and
excitement
and
keep
me
in
a
drugged
stupefied
condition
until
i
fall
asleep
to
wake
up
in
the
garden
of
prosperpine
death
is
nothing
it
is
the
dying
that
is
such
a
nuisance
it
is
going
through
so
much
for
so
little
it
is
as
bad
as
the
campaign
before
a
parliamentary
election
it
offends
one
sense
of
proportion
in
a
universe
there
would
be
no
tedious
process
of
decay
either
before
or
after
death
you
would
go
about
your
daily
avocation
unconcerned
and
unwarned
and
then
at
the
moment
appointed
by
an
inscrutable
providence
for
your
dissolution
phew
and
your
clothes
would
remain
standing
for
a
surprised
second
and
then
fall
down
in
a
heap
without
a
particle
of
you
inside
them
if
we
have
to
die
why
does
providence
employ
this
simple
and
sensible
method
it
would
save
such
a
lot
of
trouble
it
would
be
so
clean
so
painless
so
picturesque
it
would
add
to
the
interest
of
our
walks
abroad
fancy
a
stout
important
policeman
vanishing
from
his
uniform
the
helmet
falling
over
the
collar
the
tunic
doubling
in
at
the
belt
the
knees
giving
way
and
the
unheard
merry
laughter
of
the
disenuniformed
spirit
winging
its
way
truncheonless
into
the
empyrean
but
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
any
fun
out
of
dying
in
the
present
inconvenient
manner
you
are
mistaken
believe
one
who
is
trying
i
will
remain
on
my
feet
however
as
long
as
my
will
holds
out
in
this
way
i
may
continue
to
be
of
service
to
my
fellow
creatures
and
procure
for
myself
a
happy
lot
or
portion
even
this
morning
i
have
been
able
to
feel
the
throb
of
eumoiriety
a
piteous
letter
came
from
latimer
and
a
substantial
cheque
lies
on
my
table
ready
to
be
posted
i
wonder
how
much
i
have
left
so
long
as
it
is
enough
to
pay
my
doctor
bills
and
funeral
expenses
what
does
it
matter
the
last
line
of
the
above
was
written
on
december
it
is
now
january
and
i
am
still
alive
and
able
to
write
i
wish
i
were
but
i
will
set
down
as
plainly
as
i
can
what
has
happened
in
the
interval
i
had
just
written
the
last
word
seated
at
my
hotel
window
in
the
sunshine
and
enjoying
in
spite
of
my
uncheerful
thoughts
the
scents
that
rose
from
the
garden
when
i
heard
a
knock
at
my
door
at
my
invitation
to
enter
anastasius
papadopoulos
trotted
into
the
room
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
carrying
the
familiar
bunch
of
papers
he
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
pitched
the
papers
into
the
hat
and
ran
up
to
me
my
dear
sir
do
get
up
i
implore
you
and
i
wo
sit
down
i
have
just
seen
the
ever
beautiful
and
beloved
i
turned
my
chair
away
from
the
table
and
faced
him
as
he
stood
blowing
kisses
with
one
little
hand
while
the
other
lay
on
his
heart
in
a
flash
he
struck
a
new
gesture
he
folded
his
arms
and
scowled
i
was
with
her
she
was
opening
her
inmost
heart
to
me
she
knows
i
am
her
champion
a
servant
came
up
announcing
monsieur
vauvenarde
she
dismissed
me
i
have
come
to
my
patron
and
friend
the
english
statesman
her
husband
is
with
her
i
smiled
madame
brandt
told
me
that
she
had
asked
for
an
and
you
allow
it
you
allow
her
to
contaminate
her
beautiful
presence
with
the
sight
of
that
traitor
that
cheat
at
cards
that
murderer
that
devil
ah
but
i
will
not
have
it
i
am
her
champion
i
will
save
her
i
will
save
you
i
will
take
you
both
away
to
egypt
and
surround
you
with
my
beautiful
cats
and
fan
you
with
peacock
this
was
sheer
crackedness
of
brain
for
the
first
time
i
feared
for
the
little
man
when
people
begin
to
talk
that
way
they
are
not
allowed
to
go
about
loose
he
went
on
talking
and
the
three
languages
he
used
in
his
jargon
got
clotted
to
the
point
of
unintelligibility
he
spoke
very
fast
and
as
far
as
i
could
understand
poured
abuse
on
the
head
of
captain
vauvenarde
and
continued
to
declare
himself
lola
champion
and
my
devoted
friend
he
stamped
up
and
down
the
room
in
his
tightly
buttoned
from
the
breastpocket
of
which
peeped
the
fingers
of
his
yellow
dogskin
gloves
at
last
he
stopped
and
drawing
a
chair
near
the
window
perched
on
it
with
a
little
hop
like
a
child
he
held
out
his
hand
do
you
believe
i
am
your
friend
i
am
sure
of
it
my
dear
then
i
betray
a
sacred
confidence
the
loves
you
you
did
know
it
but
she
loves
i
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
dwarf
as
if
he
had
been
a
reasonable
being
something
seemed
to
click
inside
my
head
like
a
clogged
that
had
suddenly
freed
itself
and
my
mind
went
whirling
away
straight
through
the
past
few
weeks
i
tried
to
smile
and
i
said
you
are
quite
oh
no
he
replied
wagging
his
napoleonic
head
anastasius
papadopoulos
is
never
mistaken
she
told
me
so
herself
she
wept
she
put
her
beautiful
arms
round
my
neck
and
sobbed
on
my
i
found
myself
reproving
him
gently
you
should
not
have
told
me
this
my
dear
professor
such
confidences
are
locked
up
in
the
heart
of
galant
and
are
not
revealed
even
to
his
dearest
but
my
voice
sounded
hollow
in
my
own
ears
and
what
he
said
for
the
next
few
minutes
i
do
not
remember
the
little
man
had
told
the
truth
to
me
and
lola
had
told
the
truth
to
him
the
realisation
of
it
paralysed
me
why
had
i
been
such
a
fool
as
not
to
see
it
for
myself
memories
of
a
hundred
indications
came
tumbling
one
after
another
into
my
head
the
forgotten
glove
the
glances
the
changes
of
mood
the
tears
when
she
learned
of
my
illness
the
mysterious
words
the
abrupt
little
you
of
yesterday
the
woman
was
in
love
deeply
in
love
in
love
with
all
the
fervour
of
her
big
nature
and
i
had
stood
by
and
wondered
what
she
meant
by
this
and
by
that
things
that
would
have
been
obvious
to
a
coalheaver
i
thought
of
dale
and
i
felt
miserably
guilty
horribly
ashamed
how
could
i
expect
him
to
believe
me
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
wittingly
stolen
her
affections
from
him
and
her
affections
what
on
earth
could
i
do
with
them
what
is
the
use
of
a
love
to
a
dead
man
and
did
i
want
it
even
for
the
tiny
remainder
of
life
anastasius
perceiving
that
i
paid
but
scant
attention
to
his
conversation
wriggled
off
his
chair
and
stood
before
me
with
folded
arms
you
adore
each
other
with
a
great
passion
he
said
she
is
my
madonna
and
you
are
my
friend
and
benefactor
i
will
be
your
protection
and
defence
i
will
never
let
her
go
away
with
that
infamous
gambling
and
murdering
scoundrel
my
gigantic
combinations
have
matured
i
bless
your
he
lifted
his
little
arms
in
benediction
the
situation
was
cruelly
comical
for
a
moment
i
hated
the
posturing
monkey
and
had
a
wild
desire
to
throw
him
out
of
the
window
and
have
done
with
him
i
rose
and
towering
over
him
was
about
to
lecture
him
severely
on
his
impertinent
interference
when
the
sight
of
his
scared
face
made
me
turn
away
with
a
laugh
what
would
be
the
use
of
reproaching
him
he
would
only
sit
down
on
the
floor
and
weep
so
i
paced
the
room
while
he
followed
me
with
his
eyes
like
an
uncertain
spaniel
look
here
professor
said
i
at
last
now
that
you
found
captain
vauvenarde
brought
madame
brandt
and
him
together
and
told
me
that
she
is
in
love
with
me
do
you
think
you
done
enough
do
you
think
your
cats
need
your
attention
something
terrible
may
be
happening
to
them
i
dreamed
last
night
i
added
with
desperate
mendacity
that
they
were
turned
into
woolly
monsieur
said
the
dwarf
loftily
my
duty
is
here
and
i
care
not
whether
my
cats
are
turned
into
the
angels
of
i
groaned
you
are
wasting
a
great
deal
of
money
over
this
affair
i
urged
what
is
money
to
my
gigantic
combinations
tell
me
i
cried
with
considerable
impatience
what
are
your
confounded
combinations
he
began
to
tremble
violently
i
would
rather
die
said
he
than
betray
my
it
all
some
silly
nonsense
about
that
wretched
horse
i
exclaimed
he
covered
his
ears
with
his
hands
blasphemy
blasphemy
do
utter
it
in
another
moment
he
was
cowering
on
his
knees
before
me
you
of
all
men
must
blaspheme
you
whom
i
love
like
my
master
you
whom
the
divine
lady
loves
i
ca
bear
it
he
continued
to
gibber
unintelligibly
he
was
stark
mad
there
was
no
question
of
it
for
a
moment
i
stood
irresolute
then
i
lifted
him
to
his
feet
and
patted
his
head
soothingly
never
mind
said
i
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
beautiful
horse
there
never
was
such
a
horse
in
the
world
if
i
had
a
picture
of
him
i
would
hang
it
up
on
the
wall
over
my
would
you
he
cried
joyfully
then
i
will
give
you
he
trotted
over
to
the
bundle
of
papers
that
reposed
in
his
hat
on
the
floor
searched
through
them
and
to
my
dismay
handed
me
a
faded
unmounted
and
rather
torn
and
crumpled
photograph
of
the
wonderful
horse
there
said
he
i
could
not
rob
you
of
it
i
protested
it
will
be
my
joy
to
know
that
you
have
it
that
it
is
hanging
over
your
bed
see
have
you
a
pin
i
myself
will
fix
it
for
while
he
was
searching
my
table
for
pins
the
chasseur
of
the
hotel
came
with
a
message
from
madame
brandt
would
monsieur
come
at
once
to
madame
in
her
private
room
i
come
now
i
said
professor
you
must
excuse
do
mention
it
i
shall
occupy
myself
in
hanging
the
picture
in
the
most
artistic
way
so
i
left
him
his
mind
apparently
concentrated
on
the
childish
task
of
pinning
the
photograph
of
the
ridiculous
horse
on
my
bedroom
wall
and
went
with
the
most
complicated
feelings
downstairs
and
through
the
corridors
to
lola
apartments
she
rose
to
meet
me
as
i
entered
it
very
kind
of
you
to
come
she
said
in
her
fluent
but
britannic
french
may
i
present
my
husband
monsieur
monsieur
vauvenarde
and
i
exchanged
bows
i
noticed
at
once
that
he
wore
the
frenchman
costume
when
he
pays
a
de
and
gloves
and
that
a
silk
hat
lay
on
the
table
i
was
glad
that
he
paid
her
this
mark
of
respect
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
before
monsieur
said
he
in
circumstances
somewhat
i
remember
perfectly
said
i
and
your
charming
but
inexperienced
little
friend
is
he
well
he
is
at
present
decorating
my
room
with
photographs
of
madame
late
horse
sultan
said
i
he
was
startled
and
gave
me
a
quick
sharp
look
i
did
not
notice
it
at
the
time
but
i
remembered
it
later
then
he
broke
into
an
indulgent
laugh
the
poor
animal
he
turned
to
lola
how
jealous
i
used
to
be
of
him
and
how
quickly
the
time
flies
but
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
seating
yourself
he
motioned
me
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
he
was
a
man
of
polished
manner
and
had
a
pleasant
voice
i
guessed
that
in
the
days
when
he
paid
court
to
lola
he
had
been
handsome
in
his
dark
norman
way
and
possessed
considerable
fascination
evil
living
and
sordid
passions
had
coarsened
his
features
produced
bagginess
under
the
eyes
and
a
shiftiness
of
glance
idleness
and
an
inverted
habit
of
life
were
responsible
for
the
nascent
paunch
and
the
rolls
of
fat
at
the
back
of
his
neck
he
suggested
the
revivified
corpse
of
a
fine
gentleman
that
had
been
unnaturally
swollen
i
had
disliked
him
at
the
cercle
africain
now
i
detested
him
heartily
the
idea
of
lola
entering
the
vitiated
atmosphere
of
his
life
was
inexpressibly
repugnant
to
me
contrary
to
her
habit
lola
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
suite
the
palms
of
her
hands
pressing
the
seat
on
either
side
of
her
she
caught
the
shade
of
disgust
that
swept
over
my
face
and
gave
me
a
quick
glance
that
pleaded
for
toleration
her
eyes
though
bright
were
sunken
like
those
of
a
woman
who
has
not
slept
monsieur
said
vauvenarde
my
wife
informs
me
that
to
your
disinterested
friendship
is
due
this
most
charming
reconciliation
i
echoed
it
was
quickly
he
said
i
have
always
longed
for
the
comforts
of
a
home
my
wife
has
grown
tired
of
a
migratory
existence
she
comes
to
find
me
i
hasten
to
meet
her
there
is
nothing
to
keep
us
apart
the
reconciliation
was
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
i
wish
to
express
my
gratitude
to
you
and
therefore
i
ask
you
to
accept
my
most
cordial
it
has
always
been
a
pleasure
to
me
said
i
very
frigidly
to
place
my
services
at
the
disposal
of
madame
vauvenarde
monsieur
he
corrected
with
a
smile
and
is
madame
vauvenarde
equally
satisfied
with
the
reconciliation
i
asked
i
think
monsieur
vauvenarde
is
somewhat
premature
said
lola
with
a
trembling
lip
there
were
conditions
a
mere
question
of
he
waved
an
airy
hand
i
do
know
what
that
is
said
lola
there
are
conditions
i
must
fix
and
i
thought
the
advice
of
my
friend
monsieur
de
gex
precisely
my
dear
lola
he
interrupted
the
principle
is
affirmed
we
are
reconciled
i
proceed
logically
the
first
thing
i
do
is
to
thank
monsieur
de
gex
you
have
a
french
name
monsieur
and
you
pronounce
it
english
fashion
which
is
somewhat
embarrassing
but
no
matter
the
next
thing
is
the
protocol
we
have
no
possibility
of
calling
a
family
council
and
therefore
i
acceded
with
pleasure
to
the
intervention
of
monsieur
it
is
kind
of
him
to
burden
himself
with
our
unimportant
the
irony
of
his
tone
belied
the
suave
correctitude
of
his
words
i
detested
him
more
and
more
more
and
more
did
i
realise
that
the
dying
eumoirist
is
capable
of
petty
human
passions
my
vanity
was
being
sacrified
here
was
a
woman
passionately
in
love
with
me
proposing
to
throw
herself
into
another
man
arms
it
made
not
a
scrap
of
difference
in
the
circumstances
that
the
man
was
her
husband
and
into
the
arms
of
such
a
man
having
known
me
to
decline
etcetera
etcetera
how
could
she
face
it
and
why
was
she
doing
it
to
save
herself
from
me
or
me
from
herself
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
little
pain
inside
would
precious
soon
settle
that
question
why
was
she
doing
it
i
should
have
thought
that
the
first
glance
at
the
puffy
reprobate
would
have
been
enough
to
show
her
the
folly
of
her
idea
however
it
was
comforting
to
learn
that
she
had
not
surrendered
at
once
if
i
am
to
have
the
privilege
monsieur
said
i
of
acting
as
a
family
council
perhaps
you
may
forgive
my
hinting
at
some
of
the
conditions
that
doubtless
are
in
madame
proceed
monsieur
said
he
i
want
to
know
where
i
am
said
lola
in
english
he
took
everything
for
granted
from
the
are
you
willing
to
go
back
to
him
i
asked
also
in
english
she
met
my
gaze
steadily
and
i
saw
a
woman
needless
pain
at
the
back
of
her
eyes
she
moistened
her
lips
with
her
tongue
and
said
under
monsieur
said
i
in
french
turning
to
vauvenarde
forgive
us
for
speaking
our
perfectly
said
he
and
he
smiled
meaningly
and
banteringly
at
us
both
in
the
first
place
monsieur
you
are
aware
that
madame
has
a
little
fortune
which
does
not
detract
from
the
charm
you
have
always
found
in
her
it
was
left
her
by
her
father
who
as
you
know
tamed
lions
and
directed
a
menagerie
i
would
propose
that
madame
appointed
trustees
to
administer
this
little
there
is
no
necessity
monsieur
he
said
by
the
law
of
france
it
is
hers
to
do
what
she
likes
precisely
i
rejoined
trustees
would
prevent
her
from
doing
what
she
liked
with
it
madame
has
indeed
a
head
for
affairs
but
she
also
has
a
woman
heart
which
sometimes
interferes
with
a
woman
head
in
the
most
disastrous
article
no
of
the
protocol
i
went
on
feeling
happier
the
next
article
treats
of
a
little
matter
which
i
understand
has
been
the
cause
of
differences
in
the
past
between
madame
and
yourself
madame
although
she
has
not
entered
the
arena
for
some
time
has
not
finally
abandoned
i
smiled
at
the
look
of
surprise
on
lola
face
an
artist
is
always
an
artist
monsieur
she
is
willing
however
to
renounce
it
for
ever
if
you
on
your
side
will
make
quite
a
small
name
it
you
have
a
little
passion
for
baccarat
surely
monsieur
said
he
blandly
my
wife
would
not
expect
me
to
give
up
what
is
the
mere
recreation
of
every
as
a
recreation
pure
and
simple
she
would
not
insist
too
much
but
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
flatter
myself
on
being
able
to
do
it
with
perfect
french
expressiveness
i
caught
to
my
satisfaction
an
angry
gleam
in
his
eye
do
you
mean
to
say
monsieur
that
i
play
for
more
than
recreation
how
dare
i
say
anything
monsieur
but
madame
is
prejudiced
against
the
cercle
africain
for
a
bachelor
there
is
little
to
be
said
against
it
but
for
a
married
man
you
seize
the
point
said
i
monsieur
he
said
swallowing
his
wrath
and
article
since
you
have
left
the
army
would
it
not
be
better
to
engage
in
some
profession
unless
your
private
fortune
dispenses
you
from
the
he
said
nothing
but
article
it
would
give
madame
comfort
to
live
out
of
he
replied
rather
unexpectedly
we
have
the
whole
of
france
to
choose
would
not
madame
be
happier
if
she
lived
out
of
france
also
she
has
always
longed
for
a
social
i
can
give
her
one
in
are
you
quite
sure
i
asked
looking
him
in
the
eyes
monsieur
said
he
rising
and
giving
his
moustache
a
swashbuckler
twist
upward
what
are
you
daring
to
insinuate
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
fingered
the
waxed
ends
of
mine
nothing
monsieur
i
ask
a
simple
question
which
you
surely
can
have
no
difficulty
in
your
questions
are
the
height
of
indiscretion
he
cried
angrily
in
that
case
before
we
carry
this
interview
further
the
family
council
and
madame
would
do
well
to
have
a
private
monsieur
he
cried
completely
losing
his
temper
i
forbid
you
to
use
that
tone
to
me
you
are
making
a
mock
of
me
you
are
insulting
me
i
bore
with
you
long
enough
to
see
how
much
further
your
insolence
would
dare
to
go
i
not
to
have
a
hand
in
the
administration
of
my
money
i
to
forsake
a
plentiful
means
of
livelihood
i
to
become
a
commercial
traveller
i
to
expatriate
myself
i
to
explain
too
the
reasons
why
i
left
the
army
i
would
not
condescend
least
of
all
to
may
i
ask
why
monsieur
de
he
stamped
his
foot
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
here
i
am
i
came
at
my
wife
request
ready
to
take
her
back
as
my
wife
ready
to
condone
everything
yes
monsieur
as
a
man
of
the
world
you
think
i
have
no
eyes
no
understanding
ready
to
take
her
off
your
hands
i
leaped
to
my
feet
monsieur
i
thundered
lola
gave
a
cry
and
rushed
forward
i
pushed
her
aside
and
glared
at
him
i
was
in
a
furious
rage
we
glared
at
each
other
eye
to
eye
i
pointed
to
the
door
i
went
to
it
and
flung
it
wide
anastasius
papadopoulos
trotted
into
the
room
his
entrance
was
so
queer
so
unexpected
so
that
for
the
moment
the
three
of
us
were
thrown
off
our
emotional
balance
i
have
heard
all
i
have
heard
all
shrieked
the
little
man
i
know
you
for
what
you
are
i
am
the
champion
of
the
and
the
protector
of
the
english
statesman
you
are
a
traitor
and
murderer
vauvenarde
lifted
his
hand
in
a
threatening
gesture
hold
your
tongue
you
little
abortion
he
shouted
but
anastasius
went
on
screaming
and
flourishing
his
bundle
of
papers
ask
him
if
he
remembers
the
horse
sultan
ask
him
if
he
remembers
the
horse
sultan
lola
took
him
by
the
shoulders
anastasius
you
must
go
away
from
here
to
please
me
it
my
but
he
shook
himself
free
and
the
silk
hat
which
he
had
not
removed
fell
off
in
the
quick
struggle
ask
him
if
he
remembers
saupiquet
he
screamed
and
then
banged
the
door
a
malevolent
devil
put
a
sudden
idea
into
my
head
and
prompted
speech
you
remember
saupiquet
i
asked
ironically
monsieur
meddle
with
your
own
affairs
and
let
me
pass
you
shall
hear
from
the
dwarf
planted
himself
before
the
door
you
shall
not
pass
till
you
have
answered
me
do
you
remember
saupiquet
do
you
remember
the
five
francs
you
gave
to
saupiquet
to
let
you
into
sultan
stable
ah
ha
ha
you
wince
you
grow
pale
do
you
remember
the
ball
of
poison
you
put
down
sultan
throat
lola
started
forward
with
flaming
eyes
and
anguished
face
you
you
she
gasped
you
were
so
ignoble
as
to
do
that
the
accursed
brute
shouted
vauvenarde
yes
i
did
it
i
wish
i
had
burned
out
his
anastasius
sprang
at
him
like
a
tiger
cat
i
had
a
quick
vision
of
the
dwarf
clinging
in
the
air
against
the
other
bulky
form
one
hand
at
his
throat
and
then
of
an
incredibly
swift
flash
of
steel
the
dwarf
dropped
off
and
rolled
backwards
revealing
something
black
sticking
out
of
vauvenarde
for
the
second
i
could
not
realise
what
it
was
then
vauvenarde
with
a
ghastly
face
reeled
sideways
and
collapsed
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
chapter
xv
of
what
happened
immediately
afterwards
i
have
but
a
confused
memory
i
remember
that
lola
and
i
both
fell
on
our
knees
beside
the
stabbed
man
and
i
remember
his
horrible
staring
eyes
and
open
mouth
i
remember
that
though
she
was
white
and
shaky
she
neither
shrieked
went
into
hysterics
nor
fainted
i
remember
rushing
down
to
the
manager
i
remember
running
with
him
breathlessly
through
obscure
passages
of
the
hotel
in
search
of
a
doctor
who
was
attending
a
sick
member
of
the
staff
i
remember
the
rush
back
the
doctor
bending
over
the
body
which
lola
had
partially
unclothed
and
saying
he
is
dead
the
blade
has
gone
straight
through
his
and
i
have
in
my
mind
the
unforgettable
and
awful
picture
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
disregarded
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
his
absurd
silk
hat
on
some
reflex
impulse
had
caused
him
to
pick
it
up
and
put
it
on
his
head
sitting
on
the
floor
amid
a
welter
of
documents
relating
to
the
death
of
the
horse
sultan
one
of
which
he
was
eagerly
perusing
after
this
my
memory
is
clear
it
was
only
the
first
awful
shock
and
horror
of
the
thing
that
dazed
me
the
man
was
dead
said
the
doctor
he
must
lie
until
the
police
arrived
and
drew
up
the
the
manager
went
to
telephone
to
the
police
and
while
he
was
gone
i
told
the
doctor
what
had
occurred
anastasius
took
no
notice
of
us
lola
holding
her
nerves
under
iron
control
stood
bolt
upright
looking
alternately
at
the
doctor
and
myself
as
we
spoke
but
she
did
not
utter
a
word
presently
the
manager
returned
the
alarm
had
not
been
given
in
the
hotel
no
one
knew
anything
about
the
occurrence
lola
went
into
her
bedroom
and
came
back
with
a
sheet
the
manager
took
it
from
her
and
threw
it
over
the
dead
man
the
doctor
stood
by
anastasius
the
end
of
a
strip
of
sunlight
by
the
window
just
caught
the
dwarf
in
his
corner
get
up
said
the
doctor
anastasius
without
raising
his
eyes
from
his
papers
waved
him
away
i
am
busy
i
am
engaged
on
important
papers
of
identification
he
had
a
white
star
on
his
forehead
and
his
tail
was
over
a
metre
lola
approached
him
anastasius
she
said
gently
he
looked
up
with
a
radiant
smile
put
away
those
like
a
child
he
obeyed
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
then
seeing
the
unfamiliar
face
of
the
doctor
for
the
first
time
he
executed
one
of
his
politest
and
most
elaborate
bows
the
doctor
after
looking
at
him
intently
for
a
while
turned
to
me
mad
utterly
mad
apparently
he
has
no
consciousness
of
what
he
has
he
lured
him
to
the
sofa
and
sat
beside
him
and
began
to
talk
in
a
low
tone
of
the
contents
of
the
papers
anastasius
replied
cheerfully
proud
at
being
noticed
by
the
stranger
the
papers
referred
to
a
precious
secret
a
gigantic
combination
which
he
had
spent
years
in
maturing
i
shivered
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
turned
to
lola
this
is
no
place
for
you
go
into
your
bedroom
till
you
are
i
held
the
door
open
for
her
she
put
her
hands
up
to
her
face
and
reeled
and
i
thought
she
would
have
fallen
but
she
roused
herself
i
do
want
to
break
down
not
yet
i
shall
if
i
left
alone
come
and
sit
with
me
for
god
very
well
said
i
she
passed
me
and
i
followed
but
at
the
door
i
turned
and
glanced
round
the
cheerful
sunny
room
there
against
the
background
of
blue
sky
and
tree
tops
framed
by
the
window
sat
anastasius
papadopoulos
swinging
his
little
legs
and
talking
bombastically
to
the
tanned
and
grizzled
doctor
and
opposite
stood
the
correctly
attired
hotel
manager
in
the
attitude
in
which
he
habitually
surveyed
the
of
the
table
keeping
watch
beside
the
shape
on
the
floor
i
was
glad
to
shut
the
sight
from
my
eyes
we
waited
silently
in
the
bedroom
lola
sitting
on
the
bed
and
hiding
her
face
in
the
pillows
and
i
standing
by
the
window
and
looking
out
at
the
smiling
mockery
of
the
fair
earth
an
agonising
spasm
of
pain
a
shot
through
me
and
passed
away
i
thanked
god
that
a
few
weeks
would
see
the
end
of
me
i
had
always
enjoyed
the
comedy
of
life
it
had
been
to
me
a
thing
of
infinite
jest
but
this
stupid
meaningless
tragedy
was
carrying
the
joke
too
far
my
fastidiousness
revolted
at
its
vulgarity
i
no
longer
wished
to
inhabit
a
world
where
such
jests
were
possible
i
had
never
seen
a
man
die
before
i
was
surprised
at
the
swiftness
and
the
ugliness
of
it
i
suddenly
realised
that
i
was
smoking
a
cigarette
which
i
was
quite
unconscious
of
having
lit
i
threw
it
away
a
minute
afterwards
i
felt
that
if
i
did
not
smoke
i
should
go
crazy
so
i
lit
another
the
ghastly
silliness
of
the
murder
colonel
bunnion
loud
laugh
rose
from
the
terrace
below
jarring
horribly
on
my
ears
a
long
green
praying
mantis
that
had
apparently
mounted
on
the
bougainvillea
against
the
hotel
wall
appeared
in
meditative
stateliness
on
the
i
picked
the
insect
up
and
began
to
play
with
it
lola
voice
from
the
bed
startled
me
and
caused
me
to
drop
the
mantis
she
spoke
hoarsely
tell
me
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
him
i
turned
round
she
had
raised
a
crushed
face
from
the
pillows
and
looked
at
me
haggardly
i
noticed
a
carafe
of
brandy
and
a
siphon
by
the
bedside
i
mixed
her
a
strong
dose
and
before
replying
made
her
drink
it
they
place
him
under
restraint
that
all
he
not
responsible
for
his
he
did
that
once
before
i
told
you
but
without
the
knife
i
wish
i
could
cry
i
ca
you
do
think
it
heartless
of
me
but
my
brain
is
on
fire
i
shall
always
see
it
i
wish
to
god
i
had
never
asked
him
to
come
why
did
i
my
god
why
did
i
it
was
my
fault
i
wanted
to
see
him
to
judge
for
myself
how
much
of
the
old
andre
was
left
there
was
good
in
him
once
i
thought
i
might
possibly
help
him
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
in
the
world
without
you
any
kind
of
old
hell
was
good
enough
that
why
i
sent
for
him
when
he
came
after
a
bit
i
was
afraid
and
sent
for
you
afraid
of
what
i
asked
he
asked
me
at
once
what
money
i
had
then
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
i
would
join
him
we
spoke
of
you
the
friend
who
could
advise
me
he
never
said
what
he
said
afterwards
i
thought
it
kind
of
him
to
consent
to
see
you
i
rang
the
bell
and
sent
the
chasseur
for
you
i
supposed
anastasius
had
gone
home
i
never
thought
of
him
the
poor
little
man
was
sweet
to
me
just
like
a
dog
a
silent
sympathetic
dog
i
spoke
to
him
as
i
would
to
something
that
understand
all
sorts
of
foolish
things
now
and
then
a
woman
has
to
empty
her
heart
she
shivered
her
hands
before
her
face
it
my
fault
it
my
these
things
are
no
one
fault
i
said
gently
but
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
console
her
with
what
scraps
of
platitude
i
could
collect
the
only
philosophy
after
all
such
is
the
futility
of
systems
adequate
to
the
deep
issues
of
life
the
door
opened
and
the
manager
announced
that
the
police
had
arrived
we
went
through
the
ordeal
of
the
anastasius
confronted
with
his
victim
had
no
memory
of
what
had
occurred
he
shrieked
and
shrank
and
hid
his
face
in
lola
dress
when
he
was
forced
to
speak
he
declared
that
the
dead
man
was
not
captain
vauvenarde
captain
vauvenarde
was
at
the
cercle
africain
he
himself
was
seeking
him
he
would
take
the
gendarmes
there
and
they
could
arrest
the
captain
for
the
murder
of
sultan
of
which
his
papers
contained
indubitable
proofs
eventually
the
poor
little
wretch
was
led
away
in
custody
proud
and
smiling
entirely
convinced
that
he
was
leading
his
captors
to
the
arrest
of
captain
vauvenarde
on
the
threshold
he
turned
and
bowed
to
us
so
low
that
the
brim
of
his
silk
hat
touched
the
floor
then
lola
nerve
gave
way
and
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
awful
weeping
the
de
secured
the
long
thin
knife
how
the
dwarf
had
managed
to
conceal
it
on
his
small
person
was
a
mystery
and
the
bundle
of
documents
and
accompanied
me
to
my
room
to
see
whether
he
had
left
anything
there
to
serve
as
a
de
we
found
only
the
crumpled
picture
of
the
horse
sultan
neatly
pinned
against
my
bedroom
wall
and
on
the
floor
a
ribbon
tied
like
a
garter
with
a
little
bell
opposite
the
bow
on
it
was
written
santa
bianca
and
i
knew
it
was
the
collar
of
the
beloved
cat
which
he
must
have
been
carrying
about
him
for
a
talisman
the
took
this
also
if
you
desire
to
know
the
details
of
the
judicial
proceedings
connected
with
the
murder
of
andre
vauvenarde
in
the
chasseurs
and
the
trial
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
i
must
refer
you
to
the
algerian
parisian
and
london
press
there
you
will
find
an
eagerly
picturesque
account
of
the
whole
miserable
affair
now
not
only
am
i
unable
to
compete
with
descriptive
verbatim
reporters
on
their
own
ground
but
also
a
consecutive
statement
either
bald
or
graphic
of
the
tedious
horrors
lola
brandt
and
i
had
to
undergo
would
be
foreign
to
the
purpose
of
these
notes
however
far
from
their
original
purpose
an
ironical
destiny
has
caused
them
to
wander
you
know
nearly
all
that
is
necessary
for
you
to
know
so
that
when
i
am
dead
you
may
not
judge
me
too
harshly
the
remainder
i
can
summarise
in
a
few
words
at
any
rate
i
have
told
the
truth
often
more
naively
than
one
would
have
thought
possible
for
a
man
who
prided
himself
as
much
as
i
did
on
his
epicurean
sophistication
these
have
been
days
as
i
say
of
tedious
horror
there
have
been
endless
examinations
reconstructions
of
the
crime
exposures
in
daring
publicity
of
the
private
lives
of
the
protagonists
of
the
lunatic
drama
the
french
judges
and
advocates
have
accepted
the
account
given
by
lola
and
myself
of
our
mutual
relations
with
a
certain
mocking
credulity
the
press
has
accepted
it
at
all
it
took
as
a
matter
of
course
the
view
held
by
the
none
too
noble
victim
at
first
seeing
lola
shrug
her
shoulders
with
supreme
indifference
as
to
her
own
reputation
i
cared
but
little
for
these
insinuations
i
wrote
such
letters
to
my
sisters
and
to
dale
as
i
felt
sure
would
be
believed
and
let
the
gaping
world
go
hang
besides
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
physical
pain
is
insistent
and
i
have
suffered
damnable
torture
the
pettiness
of
the
legal
inquiry
has
been
also
a
maddening
irritation
nothing
has
been
too
minute
for
the
attention
of
the
french
judiciary
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
of
the
evil
gang
of
the
cercle
africain
were
called
as
witnesses
they
testified
as
to
captain
vauvenarde
part
proprietorship
of
the
hell
as
to
wrong
practices
that
occurred
there
as
to
the
crazy
conduct
of
both
anastasius
and
myself
on
the
occasion
of
my
insane
visit
officers
of
the
chasseurs
were
compelled
further
to
blacken
the
character
of
the
dead
man
he
had
been
a
notorious
plucker
of
pigeons
during
most
of
his
military
career
and
when
at
last
he
was
caught
palming
the
king
at
he
was
forced
to
resign
his
commission
arabs
came
from
the
slums
with
appalling
stories
even
the
stolid
saupiquet
dragged
from
toulon
gave
evidence
as
to
the
bribe
and
the
debt
of
fifteen
sous
and
identified
the
horse
sultan
by
the
crumpled
photograph
lola
and
i
have
been
racked
day
after
day
with
questions
some
indeed
prompted
by
the
suspicion
that
vauvenarde
might
have
met
his
death
directly
by
our
hand
instead
of
that
of
anastasius
it
was
the
who
said
it
can
be
argued
that
you
would
benefit
by
the
decease
of
the
i
replied
that
we
could
not
benefit
in
any
way
my
sole
object
was
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
husband
and
wife
will
you
explain
why
you
gave
yourself
that
trouble
i
never
have
smiled
so
grimly
as
i
did
then
how
could
i
explain
my
precious
pursuit
of
the
eumoirous
to
a
french
how
could
i
put
before
him
the
point
of
view
of
a
spirit
i
replied
with
lame
lack
of
originality
that
my
actions
proceeded
from
disinterested
friendship
you
are
a
pure
altruist
then
said
he
very
pure
said
it
was
only
the
facts
of
the
scabbard
of
the
knife
having
been
found
attached
to
the
dwarf
person
beneath
his
clothes
and
of
certain
rambling
menaces
occurring
in
his
sultan
papers
that
saved
us
from
the
indignity
of
being
arrested
and
put
into
the
dock
during
all
this
time
i
remained
at
the
hotel
at
mustapha
superieur
lola
moved
to
a
suite
of
rooms
in
another
hotel
a
little
way
down
the
hill
i
saw
her
daily
at
first
she
shrank
from
publicity
and
refused
to
go
out
save
in
a
closed
carriage
to
the
town
when
her
presence
was
necessary
at
the
inquiries
but
after
a
time
i
persuaded
her
to
brave
the
stare
of
the
curious
and
stroll
with
me
among
the
eucalyptus
woods
above
we
cut
ourselves
off
from
other
human
companionship
and
felt
like
two
lost
souls
wandering
alone
through
mist
she
conducted
herself
with
grave
and
simple
dignity
once
or
twice
she
visited
anastasius
in
prison
she
found
him
humanely
treated
and
not
despondent
he
thought
they
had
arrested
him
for
the
poisoning
of
the
horse
and
laughed
at
their
foolishness
as
they
refused
to
return
him
his
dossier
he
occupied
himself
in
reconstructing
it
and
wrote
pages
and
pages
of
incoherence
to
prove
the
guilt
of
captain
vauvenarde
he
was
hopelessly
mad
the
bond
of
pain
bound
me
very
close
to
lola
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
your
life
i
asked
her
one
day
so
long
as
i
have
you
as
a
friend
it
does
greatly
you
forget
i
said
that
you
ca
have
me
much
are
you
going
to
leave
me
it
not
because
i
have
dragged
you
through
all
this
dirt
and
horror
another
woman
might
say
that
of
another
man
but
not
i
of
you
why
are
you
going
to
leave
me
i
want
so
little
only
to
see
you
now
and
then
to
keep
the
heart
in
ca
you
realise
that
what
i
said
in
london
is
true
no
i
ca
it
unbelievable
you
ca
believe
it
yourself
if
you
did
how
could
you
go
on
behaving
like
anybody
else
like
me
for
instance
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
condemned
to
die
she
shuddered
i
should
go
mad
with
fear
i
she
broke
off
and
remained
for
some
moments
reflective
with
knitted
brow
then
she
lifted
her
head
proudly
no
i
should
i
should
face
it
like
you
only
cowards
are
afraid
it
best
to
show
things
that
you
do
care
a
hang
for
keep
that
sublime
up
when
i
dead
and
buried
said
i
and
you
pull
through
your
life
all
right
the
only
thing
you
must
avoid
is
the
pursuit
of
what
on
earth
is
that
she
asked
the
last
devastating
vanity
said
i
and
so
it
is
when
you
are
gone
she
said
bravely
i
shall
remember
how
strong
and
true
you
were
it
will
make
me
strong
i
acquiesced
silently
in
her
proposition
in
this
age
of
flippancy
and
scepticism
if
a
human
soul
proclaims
sincerely
its
faith
in
the
divinity
of
a
rabbit
in
god
name
do
disturb
it
it
is
whereto
to
refer
his
aspirations
his
resolves
it
is
a
court
of
arbitration
at
the
lowest
for
his
spiritual
disputes
and
the
rabbit
will
be
as
effective
an
oracle
as
any
other
for
are
not
all
religions
but
the
strivings
of
the
spirit
towards
crystallisation
at
some
point
outside
the
environment
of
passions
and
appetites
which
is
the
flesh
so
that
it
can
work
untrammelled
and
are
not
all
gods
but
the
accidental
forms
conditioned
by
circumstance
which
this
crystallisation
takes
all
gods
in
their
or
forms
are
false
but
on
the
other
hand
all
gods
in
their
spiritual
essence
are
true
so
i
do
not
deprecate
my
prospective
unique
position
in
lola
brandt
hagiology
it
was
better
for
her
soul
that
i
should
occupy
it
even
if
i
were
about
to
live
my
normal
life
out
like
any
other
hearty
human
marry
and
beget
children
i
doubt
whether
i
should
attempt
to
shake
my
wife
faith
in
my
heroical
qualities
this
was
but
a
fragment
of
one
among
countless
talks
some
were
lighter
in
tone
others
darker
the
mood
of
man
being
much
like
a
balloon
which
rises
or
falls
as
the
strata
of
air
are
more
rarefied
or
more
dense
perhaps
during
the
time
of
strain
the
atmosphere
was
more
often
rarefied
and
our
conversation
had
the
day
depressing
incidents
for
its
topics
we
rarely
spoke
of
the
dead
man
he
was
scarcely
a
subject
for
panegyric
and
it
was
useless
to
dwell
on
the
memory
of
his
degradation
i
think
we
only
once
talked
of
him
deeply
and
at
any
length
and
that
was
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
his
brother
a
manufacturer
at
and
a
widowed
aunt
apparently
his
only
two
surviving
relatives
arrived
in
algiers
just
in
time
to
attend
the
ceremony
they
had
seen
the
report
of
the
murder
in
the
newspapers
and
had
started
forthwith
the
brother
during
an
interview
with
lola
said
bitter
things
to
her
reproaching
her
with
the
man
downfall
and
cast
on
her
the
responsibility
of
his
death
he
spoke
she
said
as
if
i
had
suggested
the
murder
and
practically
put
the
knife
into
the
poor
crazy
little
fellow
the
vauvenardes
must
have
been
an
amiable
family
before
i
came
she
said
a
little
while
later
i
still
had
some
tenderness
for
him
a
woman
has
for
the
only
man
that
has
been
really
in
her
life
i
wish
i
could
feel
it
now
i
wish
i
could
feel
some
respect
even
but
i
ca
if
i
could
it
would
lessen
the
horror
that
has
got
hold
of
me
to
my
it
was
a
torture
to
her
generous
soul
that
she
could
not
grieve
for
him
she
could
only
shudder
at
the
tragedy
in
her
heart
she
grieved
more
for
anastasius
papadopoulos
and
in
so
doing
she
was
in
her
feminine
way
of
callous
lack
of
human
feeling
it
was
my
attempt
to
bring
her
to
a
more
rational
state
of
mind
that
caused
us
to
review
the
dead
man
career
and
recapitulate
the
unpleasing
incidents
of
the
last
interview
of
captain
vauvenarde
no
more
he
has
gone
whither
i
am
going
that
his
soul
may
rest
in
peace
is
my
earnest
prayer
but
i
do
not
wish
to
meet
him
lola
went
tearless
and
strong
through
the
horrible
ordeal
of
the
judicial
proceedings
she
said
i
gave
her
courage
perhaps
unconsciously
i
did
it
was
only
when
the
end
came
that
she
broke
down
although
she
knew
exactly
what
the
end
would
be
and
i
too
felt
a
lump
in
my
throat
when
they
sentenced
anastasius
papadopoulos
to
the
asylum
and
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
the
living
parody
of
napoleon
iii
and
the
precious
newly
written
dossier
in
his
hand
as
he
disappeared
with
a
mournful
smile
from
the
court
after
bowing
low
to
the
judge
and
to
us
without
having
understood
the
significance
of
anything
that
had
happened
in
the
carriage
that
took
us
home
she
wept
and
sobbed
bitterly
i
loved
him
so
he
was
the
only
creature
on
earth
that
loved
me
he
loved
me
as
only
a
dog
can
love
or
an
i
let
her
cry
what
could
i
say
or
do
these
have
been
weeks
of
tedious
horror
and
pain
with
the
exception
of
colonel
bunnion
i
have
kept
myself
aloof
from
my
fellow
creatures
in
the
hotel
even
taking
my
meals
in
my
own
rooms
not
wishing
to
be
stared
at
as
the
hero
of
the
scandal
that
convulsed
the
place
and
with
regard
to
colonel
bunnion
shall
i
be
accused
of
cynicism
if
i
say
that
i
admitted
him
not
to
my
confidence
but
to
my
company
because
i
know
that
it
delighted
the
honest
but
boring
fellow
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
could
rise
above
british
prejudice
and
exhibit
tact
in
dealing
with
a
man
in
a
delicate
position
for
mark
you
all
the
world
even
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
as
i
soon
discovered
believed
that
the
wife
of
the
man
who
was
murdered
before
my
eyes
was
my
mistress
colonel
bunnion
was
kind
and
he
meant
to
be
kind
he
was
a
gentleman
for
all
his
wearisomeness
and
his
kindness
was
such
as
i
could
accept
but
i
know
what
i
say
about
him
is
true
ye
gods
have
i
felt
myself
the
same
swelling
pride
in
my
broadmindedness
when
a
man
is
going
on
my
journey
he
does
not
palter
with
truth
though
i
held
myself
aloof
as
i
say
from
practically
all
my
fellow
creatures
here
i
have
not
been
cut
off
from
the
outside
world
my
sisters
like
this
french
court
in
algiers
have
accepted
my
statement
with
polite
incredulity
their
letters
have
been
full
of
love
reproach
anxiety
as
to
their
social
position
and
an
insane
desire
to
come
and
take
care
of
me
this
i
have
forbidden
them
to
do
the
pain
they
would
have
inflicted
on
themselves
dear
souls
would
have
far
outweighed
the
comfort
i
might
have
gained
from
their
ministrations
then
i
have
had
piteous
letters
from
dale
your
telegram
reassured
me
though
i
was
puzzled
now
i
get
a
letter
from
lola
telling
me
it
all
off
that
she
never
loved
me
that
she
valued
my
youth
and
my
friendship
but
that
it
is
best
for
us
not
to
meet
again
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
simon
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
i
ca
sleep
i
am
going
off
my
head
again
this
awful
newspaper
report
and
your
letter
of
explanation
i
have
them
side
by
side
forgive
me
simon
i
do
know
what
to
believe
where
to
turn
i
have
looked
up
to
you
as
the
best
and
straightest
man
i
know
you
must
be
yet
why
have
you
done
this
why
did
you
tell
me
she
was
married
why
did
she
tell
me
i
ca
write
properly
my
head
is
all
on
a
buzz
the
beastly
papers
say
you
were
living
with
her
in
algiers
but
you
were
were
you
it
would
be
too
horrible
in
fact
you
say
you
were
but
all
the
same
you
have
stolen
her
from
me
it
was
like
you
and
this
awful
murder
my
god
you
do
know
what
it
all
means
to
me
it
breaking
my
heart
and
lady
kynnersley
wrote
with
what
object
i
scarcely
know
the
situation
was
far
beyond
the
poor
lady
and
regulations
for
the
upbringing
of
families
and
the
conduct
of
life
the
elemental
mother
in
her
battled
on
the
side
of
her
only
son
foolishly
irrationally
unkindly
her
exordium
was
as
correct
as
could
be
the
tragedy
shocked
her
the
scandal
grieved
her
the
innuendoes
of
the
press
she
refused
to
believe
she
sympathised
with
me
deeply
but
then
she
turned
from
me
to
dale
and
feminine
unreason
took
possession
of
her
pen
she
bitterly
reproached
herself
for
having
spoken
to
me
of
madame
brandt
had
she
known
how
passionate
and
real
was
this
attachment
she
would
never
have
interfered
the
boy
was
he
accused
me
of
having
stolen
her
from
him
his
own
words
he
took
little
interest
in
his
electioneering
campaign
spoke
badly
unconvincingly
spent
hours
in
alternate
fits
of
listlessness
and
anger
she
feared
for
her
health
and
reason
she
made
an
appeal
to
me
who
professed
to
love
him
if
it
were
honourably
possible
would
i
bring
madame
brandt
back
to
him
she
was
willing
now
to
accept
dale
estimate
of
her
worth
could
i
at
the
least
prevail
on
madame
brandt
to
give
him
some
hope
of
what
she
did
not
know
but
some
hope
that
would
save
him
from
ruining
his
career
and
doing
something
desperate
and
another
letter
from
dale
i
ca
work
at
this
election
for
god
sake
give
her
back
to
me
then
i
wo
care
what
is
parliament
to
me
without
her
and
the
election
is
as
good
as
lost
already
the
other
side
has
made
as
much
as
possible
of
the
scandal
the
only
letters
that
have
not
been
misery
to
read
have
come
from
eleanor
faversham
there
was
one
passage
which
made
me
thank
god
that
he
had
created
such
women
as
eleanor
do
fret
over
the
newspaper
lies
dear
those
who
love
you
and
why
should
i
love
you
still
know
the
honourable
gentleman
that
you
are
write
to
me
if
it
would
ease
your
heart
and
tell
me
just
what
you
feel
you
can
now
and
always
you
have
my
utter
sympathy
and
and
this
is
the
woman
of
whose
thousand
virtues
i
dared
to
speak
in
flippant
jest
heaven
forgive
me
after
receiving
lady
kynnersley
appeal
i
went
to
lola
it
was
just
before
the
case
came
on
at
the
cour
she
had
finished
luncheon
in
her
private
room
and
was
sitting
over
her
coffee
i
joined
her
she
wore
the
black
blouse
and
skirt
with
which
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
grow
familiar
as
it
robbed
her
of
the
peculiar
fascinating
quality
which
i
have
tried
to
suggest
by
the
word
pantherine
coffee
over
we
moved
to
the
window
which
opened
on
a
little
back
garden
the
room
was
on
the
ground
floor
in
which
grew
prickly
pear
and
mimosa
and
newly
flowering
heliotrope
i
do
know
why
i
should
mention
this
except
that
some
scenes
impress
themselves
for
no
particular
reason
on
the
memory
while
others
associated
with
more
important
incidents
fade
into
vagueness
i
picked
a
bunch
of
heliotrope
which
she
pinned
at
her
bosom
lola
i
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
smiled
wanly
do
we
ever
speak
otherwise
these
dreadful
days
it
about
dale
read
this
said
i
and
i
handed
her
lady
letter
she
read
it
through
and
returned
it
to
me
well
i
asked
you
a
week
or
two
ago
what
you
were
going
to
do
with
your
life
i
said
does
that
letter
offer
you
any
suggestion
i
to
give
him
some
hope
what
hope
can
i
give
him
you
a
free
woman
free
to
marry
for
the
boy
sake
the
mother
will
consent
when
she
knows
you
as
well
as
we
know
you
she
will
she
will
what
love
me
she
a
woman
not
given
to
loving
except
in
unexpected
bursts
her
offspring
but
she
will
respect
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
silent
her
arm
resting
against
the
window
jamb
and
her
head
on
her
arm
she
remained
there
so
long
that
at
last
i
rose
and
looking
at
her
face
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
dashed
them
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand
gave
me
a
swift
look
and
went
and
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
room
an
action
of
this
kind
on
the
part
of
a
woman
signifies
a
desire
for
solitude
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
into
the
garden
it
was
a
sorry
business
i
saw
as
clearly
as
lola
that
lady
kynnersley
desired
to
purchase
dale
immediate
happiness
at
any
price
and
that
the
future
might
bring
bitter
repentance
but
i
offered
no
advice
i
have
finished
playing
at
deputy
providence
a
madman
letting
off
fireworks
in
a
gunpowder
factory
plays
a
less
dangerous
game
presently
she
joined
me
and
ran
her
arm
through
mine
i
write
to
dale
this
afternoon
she
said
do
let
us
talk
of
it
any
more
now
you
are
tired
out
it
time
for
you
to
go
and
lie
down
i
walk
with
you
up
the
it
has
come
to
this
that
i
must
lie
down
for
some
hours
during
the
day
lest
i
should
fall
to
pieces
i
suppose
i
have
to
i
laughed
what
a
thing
it
is
to
have
the
wits
of
a
man
and
the
strength
of
a
she
pressed
my
arm
and
said
in
her
low
caressing
voice
which
i
had
not
heard
for
many
weeks
i
should
be
so
proud
of
those
man
wits
if
i
were
i
knew
she
said
it
playfully
with
reference
to
masculine
of
the
feminine
but
i
chose
to
take
it
broadly
my
dear
lola
said
i
it
has
been
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
am
the
most
witless
fool
that
the
unwisdom
of
generations
of
english
country
squires
has
ever
succeeded
in
do
talk
rot
she
said
with
foolishness
in
her
eyes
she
accompanied
me
bareheaded
in
the
sunshine
to
the
gate
of
my
hotel
come
and
dine
with
me
if
you
well
enough
she
said
as
we
parted
i
assented
and
when
the
evening
came
i
went
did
i
not
say
that
we
were
like
two
lost
souls
wandering
alone
in
the
mist
it
was
only
when
i
rose
to
bid
her
that
she
referred
to
dale
i
wrote
to
him
this
afternoon
she
announced
curtly
you
said
you
would
do
would
you
like
to
know
what
i
told
him
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
back
and
stood
facing
me
somewhat
defiantly
in
all
her
magnificence
i
smiled
women
much
as
they
scoff
at
the
blindness
of
our
sex
are
often
transparent
it
your
firm
determination
to
tell
me
said
i
well
she
advanced
a
step
nearer
to
me
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
defiantly
i
told
him
that
i
loved
you
with
all
my
heart
and
all
my
soul
i
told
him
that
you
did
know
it
that
you
did
care
a
brass
curse
for
me
that
you
had
acted
as
you
thought
best
for
the
happiness
of
himself
and
me
i
told
him
that
while
you
lived
i
could
not
think
of
another
man
i
told
him
that
if
you
could
face
death
with
a
smile
on
your
face
he
might
very
well
show
the
same
courage
and
not
chuck
things
right
and
left
just
because
a
common
woman
would
marry
him
or
live
with
him
and
spoil
his
career
there
that
what
i
told
him
what
do
you
think
heaven
knows
what
effect
it
will
have
said
i
wearily
for
i
was
very
very
tired
but
why
my
poor
lola
have
you
wasted
your
love
on
a
shadow
like
me
she
answered
after
the
foolish
way
of
women
i
have
not
heard
from
either
dale
or
lady
kynnersley
a
day
or
two
ago
in
reply
to
a
telegram
to
raggles
i
learned
that
dale
had
lost
the
election
this
then
is
the
end
of
my
pro
vita
which
i
began
with
so
resonant
a
flourish
of
vainglory
i
have
said
all
that
there
is
to
be
said
nothing
more
has
happened
or
is
likely
to
happen
until
they
put
me
under
the
earth
oh
yes
i
was
forgetting
in
spite
of
my
monte
cristo
munificence
poor
latimer
has
been
hammered
on
the
stock
exchange
poor
lucy
and
the
kids
i
shall
have
i
think
just
enough
strength
left
to
reach
mentone
this
place
is
intolerable
now
and
there
i
shall
put
myself
under
the
care
of
a
capable
physician
who
with
his
abominable
drugs
will
doubtless
begin
the
cheerful
work
of
inducing
the
mental
decay
which
i
suppose
must
precede
physical
dissolution
i
must
confess
that
i
am
disappointed
with
the
manner
of
my
exit
i
had
imagined
it
quite
different
i
had
beheld
myself
turning
with
a
smile
and
a
jest
for
one
last
view
of
the
faces
over
which
i
in
my
eumoirous
career
had
cast
the
largesse
of
happiness
and
the
vanishing
with
a
gallant
carelessness
through
the
dusky
portals
instead
of
that
here
am
i
sneaking
out
of
life
by
the
back
door
covering
my
eyes
for
very
shame
and
glad
oh
god
how
glad
i
am
to
slink
out
of
it
i
have
indeed
accomplished
the
thing
which
i
set
out
to
do
i
have
severed
a
boy
from
the
object
of
his
passion
what
an
achievement
for
the
crowning
glory
of
a
lifetime
and
at
what
a
cost
one
life
and
another
reason
on
me
lies
the
responsibility
vauvenarde
it
is
true
did
not
adorn
this
grey
world
but
he
drew
the
breath
of
life
and
through
my
jesting
agency
it
was
cut
off
anastasius
papadopoulos
had
he
not
come
under
my
malign
influence
would
have
lived
out
his
industrious
happy
and
days
lesser
but
still
great
price
too
has
been
paid
jealous
hatred
misery
and
failure
for
the
being
i
care
most
for
in
the
world
the
shame
of
a
sordid
scandal
to
those
that
hold
me
dear
the
hopeless
love
and
speedy
mourning
of
a
woman
not
without
greatness
i
have
tried
to
make
a
tom
fool
of
destiny
and
destiny
has
proved
itself
to
be
the
superior
jester
of
the
two
and
has
made
a
grim
and
bedraggled
tom
fool
of
me
i
must
end
this
i
have
just
fallen
in
a
faint
on
the
floor
and
rogers
has
revived
me
with
some
drops
hunnington
had
given
me
in
view
of
such
a
contingency
these
are
the
last
words
i
shall
write
life
is
too
transcendentally
humorous
for
a
man
not
to
take
it
seriously
compared
with
it
death
is
but
a
shallow
jest
chapter
xvi
it
is
many
weeks
since
i
wrote
those
words
which
i
thought
were
to
be
my
last
i
read
them
over
now
and
laugh
aloud
life
is
more
devilishly
humorous
than
i
in
my
most
nightmare
dreams
ever
imagined
instead
of
dying
at
mentone
as
i
proposed
i
am
here
at
mustapha
superieur
still
living
and
let
me
tell
you
the
master
joke
of
the
i
am
going
to
live
i
am
not
going
to
die
i
am
going
to
live
i
am
quite
well
think
of
it
is
it
farcical
comical
tragical
or
what
this
is
how
it
has
befallen
the
last
thing
i
remember
of
the
old
conditions
was
rogers
packing
my
things
and
a
sudden
awful
excruciating
agony
i
lost
consciousness
remained
for
days
in
a
bemused
stupefied
state
which
i
felt
convinced
was
death
and
found
particularly
pleasant
at
last
i
woke
to
a
sense
of
bodily
constriction
and
discomfort
and
to
the
queer
realisation
that
what
i
had
taken
for
the
garden
of
prosperpine
was
my
own
bedroom
and
that
the
pale
lady
whom
i
had
so
confidently
assumed
was
she
who
crowned
with
calm
leaves
gathers
all
things
mortal
with
cold
immortal
hands
was
no
other
than
a
hospital
nurse
what
the
i
began
chut
she
said
flitting
noiselessly
to
my
side
you
must
and
then
she
poured
something
down
my
throat
i
lay
back
wondering
what
it
all
meant
presently
a
grizzled
and
tanned
man
wearing
a
narrow
black
tie
came
into
the
room
his
face
seemed
oddly
familiar
the
nurse
whispered
to
him
he
came
up
to
the
bed
and
asked
me
in
french
how
i
felt
i
do
know
at
all
said
i
he
laughed
that
a
good
sign
let
me
see
how
you
are
getting
he
stuck
a
thermometer
in
my
mouth
and
held
my
pulse
these
formalities
completed
he
turned
up
the
bedclothes
and
did
something
with
my
body
only
then
did
i
realise
that
i
was
tightly
bandaged
my
impressions
grew
clearer
and
when
he
raised
his
face
i
recognised
the
doctor
who
had
sat
on
the
sofa
with
anastasius
papadopoulos
nothing
could
be
better
said
he
keep
quiet
and
all
will
be
will
you
kindly
explain
i
asked
you
had
an
operation
also
a
narrow
i
smiled
at
him
pityingly
what
is
the
good
of
taking
all
this
trouble
why
are
you
wasting
your
time
he
looked
at
me
uncomprehendingly
for
a
moment
and
then
he
laughed
as
the
light
came
to
him
oh
i
understand
yes
your
english
doctors
had
told
you
you
were
going
to
die
that
an
operation
would
be
fatal
so
your
good
friend
madame
brandt
informed
us
but
we
autres
are
more
enterprising
kill
or
cure
we
performed
the
operation
we
did
kill
you
and
here
you
are
my
heart
sickened
with
a
horrible
foreboding
a
clamminess
such
as
others
feel
at
the
approach
of
death
spread
over
my
brow
and
neck
good
god
i
cried
you
are
not
trying
to
tell
me
that
i
going
to
live
why
of
course
i
am
he
exclaimed
brutally
delighted
if
nothing
else
kills
you
you
live
to
be
a
oh
damn
said
i
oh
damn
oh
damn
and
the
tears
of
physical
weakness
poured
down
my
cheeks
sont
des
droles
de
gens
les
i
heard
him
whisper
to
the
nurse
before
he
left
the
room
belonging
to
a
queer
folk
or
not
i
found
the
prospect
more
and
more
dismally
appalling
according
as
my
mind
regained
its
clarity
it
was
the
most
overwhelming
piteous
disappointment
i
have
ever
experienced
in
my
life
i
cursed
in
my
whimpering
invalid
fashion
but
do
you
want
to
get
well
asked
the
nurse
certainly
not
i
thought
i
was
dead
and
i
was
very
happy
i
been
tricked
and
cheated
and
fooled
and
i
dashed
my
fist
against
the
counterpane
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
said
the
nurse
you
will
commit
i
do
care
i
cried
and
then
they
tell
me
fainted
my
temperature
also
ran
up
and
i
became
lightheaded
again
it
was
not
until
the
next
day
that
i
recovered
my
sanity
this
time
lola
was
in
the
room
with
the
nurse
and
after
a
while
the
latter
left
us
together
even
lola
could
not
understand
my
paralysing
dismay
but
think
of
it
my
dear
friend
she
argued
just
think
of
it
you
are
saved
saved
by
a
miracle
the
doctor
says
you
will
be
stronger
than
you
have
ever
been
all
the
more
dreadful
will
it
be
said
i
i
had
finished
with
life
i
had
got
through
with
it
i
do
want
a
second
lifetime
one
is
quite
enough
for
any
sane
human
being
why
on
earth
could
they
have
let
me
die
lola
passed
her
cool
hand
over
my
forehead
you
must
talk
like
that
simon
she
said
in
her
deepest
and
most
caressing
voice
using
my
name
somewhat
hesitatingly
for
the
first
time
you
must
a
miracle
really
has
been
performed
you
been
raised
from
the
dead
like
the
man
in
the
gospel
yes
said
i
petulantly
lazarus
and
does
the
gospel
tell
us
what
lazarus
really
thought
of
the
unwarrantable
interference
with
his
plans
of
course
he
had
to
be
polite
oh
do
cried
lola
shocked
in
a
queer
unenlightened
way
she
was
a
religious
woman
i
sorry
said
i
feeling
ashamed
of
myself
if
you
knew
how
i
have
prayed
god
to
make
you
well
she
said
if
i
could
have
died
for
you
i
would
gladly
gladly
but
i
wanted
to
die
my
dear
lola
i
insisted
with
the
egotism
of
the
sick
i
object
to
this
resuscitation
i
say
it
is
monstrous
that
i
should
have
to
start
a
second
lifetime
at
my
age
it
all
very
well
when
you
begin
at
the
age
of
half
a
minute
but
when
you
begin
at
years
you
have
all
the
wisdom
of
years
to
start
there
is
only
one
thing
more
disastrous
to
a
man
than
the
wisdom
of
years
i
declared
with
mulish
inconvincibility
and
that
is
the
wisdom
he
may
accumulate
after
that
she
sighed
and
abandoned
the
argument
we
are
going
to
make
you
well
in
spite
of
yourself
she
said
they
namely
the
doctor
the
nurse
and
lola
have
done
their
best
and
they
have
succeeded
but
their
task
has
been
a
hard
one
the
will
to
live
is
always
a
great
factor
in
his
recovery
my
disgust
at
having
to
live
has
impeded
my
convalescence
and
i
fully
believe
that
it
is
only
lola
tears
and
the
doctor
frenzied
appeals
to
me
not
to
destroy
the
one
chance
of
his
life
of
establishing
a
brilliant
professional
reputation
that
have
made
me
consent
to
face
existence
again
as
for
the
doctor
he
was
pathetically
insistent
but
you
must
get
well
he
gesticulated
i
am
going
to
publish
it
your
operation
it
will
make
my
fortune
i
shall
at
last
be
able
to
leave
this
hole
of
an
algiers
and
go
to
paris
you
do
know
what
done
for
you
i
performed
an
operation
on
you
that
has
never
been
performed
successfully
before
i
thought
it
had
been
done
but
i
found
out
afterwards
my
english
were
right
it
has
i
worked
a
miracle
in
surgery
and
by
my
publication
will
make
you
as
the
subject
of
it
famous
for
ever
and
here
you
are
trying
to
die
and
ruin
everything
i
ask
you
have
you
no
human
feelings
left
at
the
conclusion
of
these
lectures
i
would
sigh
and
laugh
and
stretch
out
a
thin
hand
he
shook
it
always
with
a
humorous
grumpiness
which
did
me
more
good
than
the
prospect
of
acquiring
fame
in
the
annals
of
the
de
here
am
i
however
cured
i
have
thrown
away
the
stick
with
which
i
first
began
to
limp
about
the
garden
and
i
discourage
lola
and
rogers
in
their
efforts
to
treat
me
as
an
invalid
like
the
doctor
i
have
been
longing
to
escape
from
this
hole
of
an
algiers
and
its
painful
associations
and
when
i
was
able
to
leave
my
room
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
sooner
i
regained
my
strength
the
sooner
should
i
be
able
to
do
so
since
then
my
recovery
has
been
rapid
the
doctor
is
delighted
and
slaps
me
on
the
back
and
points
me
out
to
lola
and
the
manager
and
the
concierge
and
the
hoary
old
sinner
of
an
arab
who
displays
his
daggers
and
trays
and
embroideries
on
the
terrace
as
a
living
wonder
i
believe
he
would
like
to
put
me
in
a
cage
and
carry
me
about
with
him
in
paris
on
exhibition
but
he
is
reluctantly
prepared
to
part
with
me
and
has
consented
to
my
return
in
a
few
days
time
to
england
by
the
north
german
lloyd
steamer
he
has
ordered
the
sea
voyage
as
a
finishing
touch
to
my
cure
good
deluded
man
he
thinks
that
it
is
his
fortuitous
science
that
has
dragged
me
out
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
and
set
me
in
the
garden
of
life
good
deluded
man
he
does
not
realise
that
he
has
been
merely
the
tool
of
the
he
has
no
notion
of
the
sardonic
joke
his
knife
was
chosen
to
perpetrate
that
naked
we
should
come
into
the
world
and
naked
we
should
go
out
is
a
pleasantry
which
as
far
as
the
latter
part
of
it
is
concerned
i
did
my
conscientious
best
to
further
but
that
we
should
come
into
it
again
naked
at
the
age
of
is
a
piece
of
irony
too
grim
for
contemplation
yet
am
i
bound
to
contemplate
it
it
grins
me
in
the
face
figuratively
i
am
naked
partly
by
my
own
act
and
partly
with
the
help
of
destiny
the
greater
jester
than
i
i
have
stripped
myself
of
all
these
garments
of
life
which
not
only
enabled
me
to
strut
in
the
pleasant
places
of
the
world
but
also
sheltered
me
from
its
inclemencies
i
had
wealth
not
a
rothschild
or
vanderbilt
fortune
but
enough
to
assure
me
ease
and
luxury
i
have
stripped
myself
of
it
i
have
but
a
beggarly
sum
remaining
at
my
bankers
practically
i
am
a
pauper
i
had
political
position
i
surrendered
it
as
airily
as
i
had
achieved
it
so
airily
indeed
that
i
doubt
whether
i
could
regain
it
even
had
i
the
ambition
for
it
was
a
game
that
i
played
sometimes
fascinating
sometimes
repugnant
to
my
fastidious
sense
of
honourable
dealing
for
which
i
shall
never
recapture
the
mood
mood
depends
on
conditions
and
conditions
as
i
am
trying
to
show
are
changed
i
had
social
position
i
did
not
deceive
myself
as
to
its
value
in
the
cosmic
scheme
but
it
was
one
of
the
pleasant
things
to
which
i
was
born
just
as
i
was
born
to
good
food
and
wines
and
unpatched
boots
and
the
morning
hot
water
brought
into
my
bedroom
i
liked
it
i
suspect
that
it
has
fled
into
eternity
with
the
spirit
of
captain
vauvenarde
the
penniless
hero
of
an
amazing
scandal
is
not
usually
made
an
idol
of
by
the
exclusive
aristocracy
of
great
britain
i
had
a
sweet
and
loyal
woman
about
to
marry
me
i
put
eleanor
faversham
for
ever
out
of
my
life
i
had
the
devotion
and
of
a
lad
whom
i
thought
to
train
in
the
paths
of
honour
love
and
happiness
in
his
eyes
i
suppose
i
am
an
unconscionable
villain
i
have
stripped
myself
of
everything
and
all
because
the
medical
faculty
of
my
country
sentenced
me
to
death
i
really
think
the
royal
colleges
of
surgeons
and
physicians
ought
to
pay
me
an
indemnity
and
not
only
have
i
stripped
myself
of
everything
but
i
have
incurred
an
incalculable
debt
i
owe
a
woman
the
infinite
debt
of
her
love
which
i
can
not
repay
she
sheds
it
on
me
hourly
with
a
lavishness
which
scares
me
but
for
her
tireless
devotion
the
doctor
tells
me
i
should
not
have
lived
but
for
her
selfish
forbearance
sympathy
and
compassion
i
should
have
gone
as
crazy
as
anastasius
papadopoulos
yet
the
burden
of
my
debt
lies
iceberg
cold
on
my
heart
now
that
we
are
as
intimate
as
man
and
woman
who
are
still
only
friends
can
be
she
has
lost
the
magnetic
attraction
that
subtle
mystery
of
the
woman
half
goddess
half
panther
which
fascinated
me
in
spite
of
myself
and
made
me
jealous
of
poor
young
dale
now
that
i
can
see
things
in
some
perspective
i
confess
that
had
i
not
been
under
sentence
of
death
and
therefore
profoundly
convinced
that
i
was
immune
from
all
such
weaknesses
of
the
flesh
i
should
have
realised
the
temptation
of
languorous
voice
and
sinuous
limbs
of
the
frank
radiation
of
the
animal
enchanted
as
it
was
by
elusive
gleams
of
the
spiritual
of
the
laisdom
in
a
word
of
all
the
sexual
damnability
of
a
woman
which
as
francois
villon
points
out
set
sardanapalus
to
spin
among
the
women
david
to
forget
the
fear
of
god
herod
to
slay
the
baptist
and
made
samson
lose
his
sight
whether
i
should
have
yielded
to
or
resisted
the
temptation
is
another
matter
honestly
speaking
i
think
i
should
have
resisted
you
see
i
should
still
have
been
engaged
to
eleanor
faversham
but
now
this
somewhat
unholy
influence
is
gone
from
her
she
has
lifted
me
in
her
strong
arms
as
a
mother
would
lift
a
brat
of
ten
she
has
patiently
suffered
my
whimsies
as
if
i
had
been
a
sick
girl
she
has
become
to
me
the
mere
great
mothering
creature
on
whom
i
have
depended
for
custard
and
the
removal
of
crumbs
and
creases
from
under
my
body
and
for
support
to
my
tottering
footsteps
the
glamour
has
gone
from
before
my
eyes
i
no
longer
see
her
invested
in
her
queer
splendour
my
invalid
peevishness
too
has
accentuated
my
sensitiveness
to
shades
of
refinement
there
is
about
lola
a
bluffness
a
hardihood
of
speech
a
contempt
for
the
polite
word
and
the
pretty
conventional
turning
of
a
phrase
a
lack
of
reticence
in
the
expression
of
ideas
and
feelings
which
jar
in
spite
of
my
gratitude
on
my
unstrung
nerves
her
ignorance
too
of
a
thousand
things
a
knowledge
of
which
is
the
birthright
of
such
women
as
eleanor
faversham
causes
conversational
excursions
to
end
in
innumerable
blind
alleys
i
know
that
she
would
give
her
soul
to
learn
this
she
has
told
me
in
so
many
words
and
when
in
a
delicate
way
i
try
to
teach
her
she
listens
humbly
pathetically
fixing
me
with
her
great
eyes
behind
which
a
deep
sadness
burns
wistfully
sometimes
when
i
glance
up
from
my
book
i
see
that
her
eyes
instead
of
being
bent
on
hers
have
been
resting
long
on
my
face
and
they
say
as
clearly
as
articulate
speech
teach
me
love
me
use
me
do
what
you
will
with
me
i
am
yours
your
chattel
your
thing
till
the
end
of
i
lie
awake
at
night
and
wonder
what
i
shall
do
with
my
naked
life
sheltered
only
by
the
garment
of
this
woman
love
which
i
have
accepted
and
can
not
repay
i
groan
aloud
when
i
reflect
on
the
irremediable
mess
hash
bungle
i
have
made
of
things
did
ever
sick
man
wake
up
to
such
a
hopeless
welter
can
you
be
surprised
that
i
regarded
it
with
dismay
of
course
there
is
a
simple
way
out
of
it
and
into
the
shadowy
world
which
i
contemplated
so
long
at
first
with
mocking
indifference
and
then
with
eager
longing
a
gentleman
called
cato
once
took
it
with
considerable
aplomb
the
means
are
to
my
hand
in
my
drawer
lies
the
revolver
with
which
the
excellent
colonel
bunnion
long
since
departed
from
mustapha
superieur
armed
me
against
the
banditti
of
algiers
and
which
i
forgot
to
return
to
him
i
could
empty
one
or
more
of
the
six
chambers
into
my
person
and
that
would
be
the
end
but
i
do
think
history
records
the
suicide
of
any
humorist
however
dismal
he
knows
too
well
the
tricks
of
the
game
very
likely
i
should
merely
blow
away
half
my
head
and
destiny
would
give
my
good
doctor
another
chance
of
achieving
immortal
fame
by
glueing
it
on
again
no
i
can
not
think
seriously
of
suicide
by
violent
means
of
course
i
might
follow
the
example
of
one
antonios
polemon
a
later
greek
sophist
who
suffered
so
dreadfully
from
gout
that
he
buried
himself
alive
in
the
tomb
of
his
ancestors
and
starved
to
death
we
have
a
family
vault
in
highgate
cemetery
of
which
i
possess
the
key
no
i
should
be
bored
and
cold
and
the
coffins
would
get
on
my
nerves
and
besides
there
is
something
suggestive
of
smug
villadom
in
the
idea
of
going
to
die
at
highgate
lola
came
up
as
i
was
scribbling
this
on
my
knees
in
the
garden
what
are
you
writing
there
i
am
recasting
hamlet
soliloquy
i
replied
and
i
feel
all
the
better
for
here
is
your
egg
and
i
swallowed
it
and
handed
her
back
the
glass
i
feel
all
the
better
for
that
as
i
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
little
stone
within
the
greek
portico
she
lingered
in
the
blazing
sunshine
a
figure
all
glorious
health
and
supple
curves
and
the
stray
brown
hairs
above
the
brown
mass
gleamed
with
the
gold
of
a
giotto
aureole
she
stood
a
duskily
glowing
radiant
emblem
of
life
against
the
background
of
spring
greenery
and
rioting
convolvulus
i
drew
a
full
breath
and
looked
at
her
as
if
magnetised
i
had
the
very
oddest
sensation
she
seemed
in
shakespearean
phrase
to
rain
influence
upon
me
as
if
she
read
the
stirrings
of
my
blood
she
smiled
and
said
after
all
confess
is
it
good
to
be
alive
a
thrill
of
physical
swept
through
me
i
leaped
to
my
feet
you
witch
i
cried
what
are
you
doing
to
me
i
she
retreated
a
step
with
a
laugh
yes
you
you
are
casting
a
spell
on
me
so
that
i
may
eat
my
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
but
you
have
answered
my
question
it
good
to
be
well
it
is
i
assented
losing
all
sense
of
consistency
she
flourished
the
glass
i
so
glad
now
i
know
you
are
really
well
and
will
face
life
as
you
faced
death
like
the
brave
man
that
you
i
cried
to
her
to
hold
i
had
not
intended
to
go
as
far
as
that
i
confronted
death
with
a
smile
i
meet
life
with
the
wriest
of
wry
faces
she
would
have
none
of
my
arguments
no
matter
how
damnable
it
is
it
splendid
to
be
alive
just
to
feel
that
you
can
fight
just
to
feel
that
you
do
care
a
damn
for
any
old
thing
that
can
happen
because
you
strong
and
brave
i
do
want
you
to
get
back
all
that
you
lost
all
that
you
lost
through
me
and
you
do
it
i
know
that
you
do
it
you
just
go
out
and
smash
up
the
silly
old
world
and
bring
it
to
your
feet
you
will
simon
you
i
know
you
she
quivered
like
an
optimistic
cassandra
my
dear
lola
said
i
was
touched
i
took
her
hand
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
whereat
she
flushed
like
a
girl
did
you
come
here
to
tell
me
all
this
no
she
replied
simply
it
came
all
of
a
sudden
as
i
was
standing
here
i
often
wanted
to
say
it
i
glad
i
she
threw
back
her
head
and
regarded
me
a
moment
with
a
strange
proud
smile
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
away
her
head
brushing
the
long
scarlet
clusters
of
the
pepper
trees
chapter
xvii
the
other
day
while
looking
through
a
limbo
of
a
drawer
wherein
have
been
cast
from
time
to
time
a
medley
of
maimed
abortive
things
too
unfitted
for
the
paradise
of
publication
and
too
good
so
my
vanity
will
have
it
for
the
damnation
of
the
basket
i
came
across
at
the
very
bottom
the
manuscript
of
the
preceding
autobiographical
narrative
the
last
words
of
which
i
wrote
at
mustapha
superieur
three
years
ago
at
first
i
carried
it
about
with
me
not
caring
to
destroy
it
and
not
knowing
what
in
the
world
to
do
with
it
until
with
the
malice
of
inanimate
things
the
dirty
bundle
took
to
haunting
me
turning
up
continually
in
inconvenient
places
and
ever
insistently
demanding
a
new
depository
at
last
i
began
to
look
on
it
with
loathing
and
one
day
in
a
fit
of
inspiration
creating
the
limbo
aforesaid
i
hurled
the
manuscript
as
i
thought
into
everlasting
oblivion
i
had
no
desire
to
carry
on
the
record
of
my
life
any
further
and
there
in
limbo
it
has
remained
for
three
years
but
the
other
day
i
took
it
out
for
reference
and
now
as
i
am
in
a
certain
little
backwater
of
the
world
where
it
is
raining
in
a
most
unholiday
fashion
it
occurs
to
me
that
as
everything
has
happened
to
me
which
is
likely
to
happen
heaven
knows
i
want
no
more
excursions
and
alarums
in
my
life
drama
i
may
as
well
bring
the
narrative
up
to
date
i
therefore
take
up
the
thread
so
far
as
i
can
from
where
i
left
off
lola
having
nothing
to
do
in
algiers
which
had
grown
hateful
to
us
both
accompanied
me
to
london
as
however
the
weather
was
rough
and
she
was
a
very
bad
sailor
i
saw
little
of
her
on
the
voyage
for
my
own
part
i
enjoyed
the
stormy
days
the
howling
winds
and
the
infuriated
waves
dashing
impotently
over
the
steamer
they
filled
me
with
a
sense
of
conflict
and
of
amusement
it
is
always
good
to
see
man
triumphing
over
the
murderous
forces
of
nature
it
puts
one
in
conceit
with
kind
at
waterloo
i
handed
lola
over
to
her
maid
who
had
come
to
meet
her
and
leaving
rogers
in
charge
of
my
luggage
i
drove
homeward
in
a
cab
it
was
only
as
i
was
crossing
waterloo
bridge
and
saw
the
dark
mass
of
the
houses
of
parliament
looming
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
the
light
in
the
tower
which
showed
that
the
house
was
sitting
that
i
began
to
realise
my
situation
as
exiles
in
desert
lands
yearn
for
green
fields
so
yearned
i
for
those
green
benches
in
vain
i
represented
to
myself
how
often
i
had
yawned
on
them
how
often
i
had
cursed
my
folly
in
sitting
on
them
and
listening
to
empty
babble
when
i
might
have
been
dining
cosily
or
talking
to
a
pretty
woman
or
listening
to
a
comic
opera
or
performing
some
other
useful
and
action
of
the
kind
in
vain
i
told
myself
what
a
monument
of
futility
was
that
building
i
longed
to
be
in
it
and
of
it
once
again
and
when
i
realised
that
i
yearned
for
the
impossible
my
heart
was
like
a
stone
for
indeed
i
simon
de
gex
with
london
once
a
toy
to
my
hand
was
coming
into
it
now
a
penniless
adventurer
to
seek
my
fortune
the
cab
turned
into
the
strand
which
greeted
me
as
affably
as
a
pandemonium
motor
omnibuses
whizzed
at
me
cabs
rattled
and
jeered
at
me
private
motors
and
carriages
passed
me
by
in
sleek
contempt
policemen
regarded
me
scornfully
as
with
uplifted
hand
regulating
the
traffic
they
held
me
up
pavements
full
of
people
surged
along
ostentatiously
showing
that
they
did
not
care
a
brass
farthing
for
me
the
thousands
of
lights
with
their
million
reflections
from
shop
fronts
restaurants
theatres
and
illuminated
signs
glared
pitilessly
at
me
a
harsh
roar
of
derision
filled
the
air
like
the
bass
to
the
treble
of
the
newsboys
who
yelled
in
my
face
i
was
wearing
a
coat
just
the
thing
a
penniless
adventurer
would
wear
i
had
a
valet
attending
to
my
luggage
just
the
sort
of
thing
a
penniless
adventurer
would
have
i
was
driving
to
the
albany
just
the
sort
of
place
where
a
penniless
adventurer
would
live
and
london
knew
all
this
and
scoffed
at
me
in
stony
heartlessness
the
only
object
that
gave
me
the
slightest
sympathy
was
nelson
on
top
of
his
column
he
seemed
to
say
after
all
you
feel
such
a
fool
and
so
much
out
in
the
cold
as
i
do
up
at
piccadilly
circus
i
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
hostility
my
cab
was
blocked
in
the
tide
and
in
neighbouring
vehicles
i
had
glimpses
of
fair
faces
above
soft
wraps
and
the
profiles
of
moustached
young
men
in
white
ties
they
assumed
an
aggravating
air
of
ownership
of
the
blazing
thoroughfare
the
only
gay
and
joyous
spot
in
london
i
too
had
owned
it
once
but
now
i
felt
an
alien
and
the
whole
spirit
of
piccadilly
circus
rammed
the
sentiment
home
i
was
an
alien
and
an
undesirable
alien
i
felt
even
more
lost
and
friendless
as
i
entered
the
long
cold
arcade
known
as
the
ropewalk
of
the
albany
i
found
my
sister
agatha
waiting
for
me
in
the
library
i
had
telegraphed
to
her
from
southampton
she
was
expensively
dressed
in
grey
silk
and
wore
the
family
diamonds
we
exchanged
the
family
kiss
and
the
usual
incoherent
greetings
of
our
race
she
expressed
her
delight
at
my
restoration
to
health
and
gave
me
satisfactory
tidings
of
tom
durrell
her
husband
of
the
children
and
of
our
sister
jane
then
she
shook
her
head
at
me
and
made
me
feel
like
a
naughty
little
boy
this
i
resented
being
the
head
of
the
family
i
had
always
encouraged
the
deferential
attitude
which
my
sisters
dear
things
had
naturally
assumed
from
babyhood
oh
simon
what
a
time
you
given
us
she
had
never
spoken
to
me
like
this
in
her
life
that
nothing
my
dear
agatha
said
i
just
a
bit
tartly
to
the
time
i
given
myself
i
sorry
for
you
but
i
think
you
ought
to
be
a
little
sorry
for
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
say
oh
simon
how
could
you
how
could
i
what
i
cried
unwontedly
regardless
of
the
refinements
of
language
mix
yourself
up
in
this
dreadful
affair
my
dear
girl
said
i
if
you
had
got
mixed
up
in
a
railway
collision
i
should
ask
you
how
you
managed
to
do
it
i
should
be
sorry
for
you
and
feel
your
arms
and
legs
and
inquire
whether
you
had
sustained
any
internal
she
is
a
pretty
spare
woman
with
a
face
and
soft
brown
hair
just
turning
grey
and
as
a
little
creature
as
ever
adored
five
healthy
children
and
an
elderly
baronet
with
disastrous
views
on
scientific
farming
dear
old
boy
she
said
in
milder
accents
i
did
mean
to
be
unkind
i
want
to
be
good
to
you
and
help
you
so
much
so
that
i
asked
bingley
bingley
is
my
housekeeper
whether
i
could
stay
to
that
good
of
you
but
this
magnificence
i
going
on
later
to
the
foreign
office
then
you
do
still
mingle
with
the
great
and
gorgeous
i
said
what
do
you
mean
why
should
i
i
laughed
suspecting
rightly
that
my
sisters
social
position
had
not
been
greatly
imperilled
by
the
profligacy
of
their
brother
what
are
people
saying
about
me
i
asked
suddenly
she
made
a
helpless
gesture
ca
you
guess
you
have
told
us
the
facts
and
of
course
we
believe
you
we
have
done
our
best
to
spread
abroad
the
correct
version
but
you
know
what
people
are
if
told
they
ought
to
believe
the
worst
they
disappointed
and
still
go
on
believing
it
so
as
to
comfort
you
cynical
little
wretch
said
i
but
it
true
she
urged
and
after
all
even
if
they
were
well
disposed
the
correct
version
makes
considerable
demands
on
their
faith
even
letty
farfax
i
know
i
know
said
i
letty
farfax
is
typical
she
would
love
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
angels
but
as
she
would
meet
the
best
people
there
she
ranges
herself
with
the
other
presently
we
dined
and
during
the
meal
when
the
servants
happened
to
be
out
of
the
room
we
continued
the
inconclusive
conversation
like
a
good
sister
agatha
had
come
to
cheer
a
lonely
and
much
abused
man
like
a
daughter
of
eve
she
had
also
come
to
find
out
as
much
as
she
possibly
could
i
think
i
must
tell
you
something
which
you
ought
to
know
she
said
it
all
over
the
town
that
you
stole
the
lady
from
dale
if
i
did
said
i
it
was
at
his
mother
earnest
entreaty
you
can
tell
folks
that
you
can
also
tell
them
madame
brandt
is
not
the
kind
of
woman
to
be
stolen
by
one
man
from
another
she
is
a
thoroughly
virtuous
good
and
noble
woman
and
there
not
a
creature
living
who
would
be
honoured
by
her
as
i
made
this
announcement
with
an
impetuosity
which
reminded
me
with
a
twinge
of
remorse
of
poor
dale
dithyrambics
agatha
shot
at
me
a
quick
glance
of
apprehension
but
my
dear
simon
she
used
to
act
in
a
circus
with
a
horse
i
fail
to
see
said
i
growing
angry
how
the
horse
could
have
imbued
her
with
depravity
and
i
given
to
understand
that
the
tone
of
the
circus
is
not
quite
what
it
used
to
be
in
the
days
of
the
empress
a
ripple
passed
over
agatha
bare
shoulders
which
i
knew
to
be
a
suppressed
shrug
i
suppose
men
and
women
look
at
these
things
differently
she
remarked
and
from
the
stiffness
of
her
tone
i
divined
that
the
idea
of
moral
qualities
lurking
in
the
nature
of
lola
brandt
occasioned
her
considerable
displeasure
i
hope
she
paused
there
was
another
ripple
no
i
had
better
not
say
it
it
none
of
my
business
after
i
do
think
it
is
my
dear
said
rogers
bringing
in
the
cutlets
ended
the
snippet
of
talk
it
was
not
the
cheeriest
of
dinners
i
took
advantage
of
the
next
interval
of
quiet
to
inquire
after
dale
i
learned
that
the
poor
boy
had
almost
collapsed
after
the
election
and
was
now
yachting
with
young
lord
essendale
somewhere
about
the
hebrides
agatha
had
not
seen
him
but
lady
kynnersley
had
called
on
her
one
day
in
a
distracted
frame
of
mind
bitterly
reproaching
me
for
the
unhappiness
of
her
son
i
should
never
have
suspected
that
such
fierce
maternal
love
could
burn
beneath
lady
kynnersley
granite
exterior
she
accused
me
of
treachery
towards
dale
and
most
illogically
of
dishonourable
conduct
towards
herself
she
said
things
about
you
said
agatha
for
which
even
if
they
were
true
i
could
forgive
her
so
that
an
end
of
that
friendship
indeed
it
has
been
very
difficult
simon
she
continued
to
keep
up
with
our
common
friends
it
has
placed
us
in
the
most
painful
and
delicate
position
and
now
you
back
i
afraid
it
will
be
thus
under
all
agatha
affection
there
ran
the
general
hostility
of
london
guilty
or
not
i
had
offended
her
in
her
most
deeply
rooted
susceptibilities
and
as
yet
she
only
knew
half
the
imbroglio
in
which
i
was
enmeshed
over
coffee
however
she
began
to
take
a
more
optimistic
view
of
affairs
after
all
you
be
able
to
live
it
down
she
said
with
a
cheerful
air
of
patronage
people
soon
forget
before
the
year
is
out
be
going
about
just
as
usual
and
at
the
general
election
you
find
a
seat
i
informed
her
that
i
had
given
up
politics
what
then
she
asked
would
i
do
for
an
occupation
work
for
my
living
i
replied
work
she
arched
her
eyebrows
as
if
it
were
the
most
extraordinary
thing
a
man
could
do
what
kind
of
work
or
or
she
selected
a
cigarette
from
the
silver
box
in
front
of
her
and
did
not
reply
until
she
had
lit
it
and
inhaled
a
puff
or
two
i
wish
you
would
be
so
flippant
from
this
remark
i
inferred
that
i
still
was
in
the
criminal
dock
before
this
lady
chief
justice
i
smiled
at
the
airs
the
little
woman
gave
herself
now
that
i
was
no
longer
the
impeccable
and
irreproachable
dictator
of
the
family
mine
was
the
experience
of
every
fallen
tyrant
since
the
world
began
my
dear
agatha
i
had
enough
shocks
during
the
last
few
weeks
to
knock
the
flippancy
out
of
a
congregational
minister
in
november
i
was
condemned
to
die
within
six
months
the
sentence
was
final
and
absolute
i
thought
i
would
do
the
kind
of
good
one
ca
do
with
a
lifetime
in
front
of
one
and
i
wasted
all
my
substance
in
riotous
giving
in
the
elegant
phraseology
of
high
society
i
am
as
my
training
has
not
fitted
me
to
earn
my
living
in
ways
i
must
earn
it
in
some
humble
capacity
therefore
if
you
see
me
call
at
your
house
for
the
water
rate
you
understand
that
i
am
driven
to
that
expedient
by
necessity
and
not
by
naturally
i
had
to
elaborate
this
succinct
statement
before
my
sister
could
understand
its
full
significance
then
dismay
overwhelmed
her
surely
something
could
be
done
the
fortunes
of
jane
and
herself
were
at
my
disposal
to
set
me
on
my
feet
again
we
were
brother
and
sisters
what
was
theirs
was
mine
they
could
see
me
starve
i
thanked
her
for
her
affection
the
dear
creatures
would
unhesitatingly
have
let
me
play
ducks
and
drakes
with
their
money
but
i
explained
that
though
poor
i
was
still
proud
and
prized
the
independence
of
the
above
the
position
of
the
pensioner
of
love
bounty
tom
must
get
you
something
to
do
she
declared
tom
must
do
nothing
of
the
kind
let
me
say
that
once
and
for
all
i
returned
peremptorily
i
made
my
position
clear
to
you
because
you
my
sister
and
you
ought
to
be
spared
any
further
misinterpretation
of
my
actions
but
to
have
you
dear
people
intriguing
after
billets
for
me
would
be
but
what
are
you
going
to
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
i
going
for
my
first
omnibus
ride
said
i
heroically
upon
which
assertion
rogers
entered
announcing
that
her
carriage
had
arrived
a
while
later
i
accompanied
her
downstairs
and
along
the
arcade
i
shall
be
so
miserable
thinking
of
you
poor
old
boy
she
said
affectionately
as
she
bade
me
do
i
am
going
to
enjoy
myself
for
the
first
time
in
my
these
were
prave
but
i
felt
doleful
enough
when
i
the
chambers
where
i
had
lived
in
uncomplaining
luxury
for
fourteen
years
there
no
help
for
it
i
murmured
i
must
get
rid
of
the
remainder
of
my
lease
sell
my
books
and
pictures
and
other
more
or
less
expensive
household
goods
dismiss
rogers
and
bingley
and
go
and
live
on
thirty
shillings
a
week
in
a
bloomsbury
i
think
i
continued
regarding
myself
in
the
queen
anne
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
i
think
that
it
will
better
harmonise
with
my
fallen
fortunes
if
i
refrain
from
waxing
the
ends
of
my
moustache
there
ought
to
be
a
modest
droop
about
the
moustache
of
a
the
next
morning
i
gave
my
servants
a
months
notice
rogers
who
had
been
with
me
for
many
years
behaved
in
the
correctest
manner
he
neither
offered
to
lend
me
his
modest
savings
nor
to
work
for
me
for
no
wages
he
expressed
his
deep
regret
at
leaving
my
service
and
his
confidence
that
i
would
give
him
a
good
character
bingley
wept
after
the
way
of
women
there
was
also
a
shadowy
housemaidy
young
person
in
a
cap
who
used
to
make
meteoric
appearances
and
whom
i
left
to
the
diplomacy
of
bingley
these
dismal
rites
performed
i
put
my
chambers
into
the
hands
of
a
house
agent
and
interviewed
a
firm
of
auctioneers
with
reference
to
the
sale
it
was
all
exceedingly
unpleasant
the
agent
was
so
anxious
to
let
my
chambers
the
auctioneer
so
delighted
at
the
chance
of
selling
my
effects
that
i
felt
myself
forthwith
turned
neck
and
crop
out
of
doors
it
was
a
bright
morning
in
early
spring
with
a
satirical
touch
of
hope
in
the
air
london
no
longer
to
be
my
london
maintained
its
hostile
attitude
to
me
if
any
one
had
prophesied
that
i
should
be
a
stranger
in
piccadilly
i
should
have
laughed
aloud
yet
i
was
walking
moodily
up
saint
james
street
i
met
the
omniscient
and
expansive
renniker
he
gave
me
a
curt
nod
and
a
how
d
do
and
passed
on
i
felt
savagely
disposed
to
slash
his
jaunty
silk
hat
off
with
my
a
few
months
before
he
would
have
rushed
effusively
into
my
arms
and
bedaubed
me
with
miscellaneous
inaccuracies
of
information
at
first
i
was
furiously
indignant
then
i
laughed
and
swinging
my
stick
nearly
wreaked
my
vengeance
on
a
harmless
elderly
gentleman
it
was
my
first
experience
of
social
ostracism
although
i
curled
a
contumelious
lip
i
smarted
under
the
indignity
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
proudly
son
but
used
to
be
a
person
of
some
importance
who
was
not
cavalierly
how
d
do
by
creatures
like
renniker
this
and
the
chance
encounters
of
the
next
few
weeks
gave
me
furiously
to
think
i
knew
that
in
one
respect
my
sister
agatha
was
right
these
good
folks
who
shied
now
at
the
stains
of
murder
with
which
my
reputation
was
soiled
would
in
time
get
used
to
them
and
eventually
forget
them
altogether
but
i
reflected
that
i
should
not
forget
and
i
determined
that
i
should
not
be
admitted
on
sufferance
as
at
first
i
should
have
to
be
admitted
into
any
man
club
or
any
one
day
colonel
ellerton
maisie
ellerton
father
called
on
me
he
used
to
be
my
very
good
friend
we
sat
on
the
same
side
of
the
house
and
voted
together
on
innumerable
occasions
in
perfect
sympathy
and
common
lack
of
conviction
he
was
cordial
enough
congratulated
me
on
my
marvellous
restoration
to
health
deplored
my
absence
from
parliamentary
life
and
then
began
to
talk
confusedly
of
russia
it
took
a
little
perspicacity
to
see
that
something
was
weighing
on
the
good
man
mind
something
he
had
come
to
say
and
for
his
honest
life
could
not
get
out
his
plight
became
more
pitiable
as
the
interview
proceeded
and
when
he
rose
to
go
he
grew
as
red
as
a
and
began
to
sputter
i
went
to
his
rescue
it
very
kind
of
you
to
have
come
to
see
me
ellerton
i
said
but
if
i
do
call
yet
awhile
to
pay
my
respects
to
your
wife
i
hope
you
understand
and
not
attribute
it
to
i
have
never
seen
relief
so
clearly
depicted
on
a
human
countenance
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
instinctively
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
forehead
then
he
grasped
my
hand
my
dear
fellow
he
cried
of
course
we
understand
it
was
a
shocking
affair
terrible
for
you
my
wife
and
i
were
quite
bowled
over
by
i
did
not
attempt
to
clear
myself
what
was
the
use
every
man
denies
these
things
as
a
matter
of
course
and
as
a
matter
of
course
nobody
believes
him
once
i
ran
across
elphin
montgomery
a
mysterious
personage
behind
many
musical
comedy
enterprises
he
is
jewelled
all
over
like
a
hindoo
idol
and
is
treated
as
a
god
in
fashionable
restaurants
where
he
entertains
at
sumptuous
banquets
i
had
some
slight
acquaintance
with
the
fellow
but
he
greeted
me
as
though
i
were
a
long
lost
intimate
his
heavy
sensual
face
swagged
in
smiles
and
invited
me
to
a
supper
party
i
declined
with
courtesy
and
walked
away
in
fury
he
would
not
have
presumed
to
ask
me
to
meet
his
before
i
became
disgustingly
and
i
suppose
to
some
minds
fascinatingly
notorious
but
now
i
was
with
him
a
bird
of
his
own
feather
a
rogue
of
his
own
kidney
to
whom
he
threw
open
the
gates
of
his
bediamonded
and
befrilled
alsatia
a
pestilential
fellow
as
if
i
would
mortgage
my
birthright
for
such
a
mess
of
pottage
so
i
stiffened
and
bade
society
high
and
low
go
packing
i
would
neither
seek
mine
own
people
nor
allow
myself
to
be
sought
by
elphin
montgomery
i
enwrapped
myself
in
a
fine
garment
of
defiance
my
sister
jane
who
was
harder
and
more
than
agatha
would
have
had
me
don
a
helmet
of
brass
and
a
breastplate
of
rhinoceros
hide
and
force
my
way
through
reluctant
portals
but
agatha
agreed
with
me
clinging
however
to
the
hope
that
time
would
not
only
reconcile
society
to
me
but
would
also
reconcile
me
to
society
if
the
hope
comforts
you
my
dear
agatha
said
i
by
all
means
cherish
it
in
the
meantime
allow
me
to
observe
that
the
character
of
ishmael
is
eminently
suited
to
the
profession
of
during
these
early
days
of
my
return
the
one
person
with
whom
i
had
no
argument
was
lola
she
soothed
where
others
scratched
and
stimulated
where
others
goaded
the
intimacy
of
my
convalescence
continued
at
first
i
acquainted
her
as
far
as
was
reasonably
necessary
with
my
change
of
fortune
and
accepted
her
offer
to
find
me
less
expensive
quarters
the
devoted
woman
personally
inspected
every
flat
in
london
with
that
insistence
of
which
masculine
patience
is
incapable
and
eventually
decided
on
a
tiny
bachelor
suite
somewhere
in
the
clouds
over
a
block
of
flats
in
victoria
street
where
the
service
is
included
in
the
rent
into
this
i
moved
with
such
of
my
furniture
as
i
withdrew
from
the
auctioneer
hammer
and
there
i
prepared
to
stay
until
necessity
should
drive
me
to
the
bloomsbury
i
thought
i
would
graduate
my
descent
before
i
moved
however
she
came
to
the
albany
for
the
first
and
only
time
to
see
the
splendour
i
was
about
to
quit
in
a
modest
way
it
was
splendour
my
chambers
were
really
a
large
double
flat
to
the
tasteful
furnishing
of
which
i
had
devoted
the
thought
and
interest
of
many
years
she
went
with
me
through
the
rooms
the
was
all
chippendale
each
piece
a
and
hunted
treasure
the
library
old
oak
the
a
comfortable
and
cunning
medley
there
were
bits
of
old
china
pieces
of
tapestry
some
rare
prints
my
choice
collection
of
mezzotints
a
picture
or
two
of
value
one
a
lancret
a
very
dear
possession
and
there
were
my
books
once
i
had
a
passion
for
rare
bindings
every
thing
had
to
me
a
personal
significance
and
i
hated
the
idea
of
surrender
more
than
i
dared
to
confess
even
to
myself
but
i
said
to
lola
vanity
of
vanities
all
things
expensive
are
vanity
her
eyes
glistened
and
she
slipped
her
arm
through
mine
and
patted
the
back
of
my
hand
if
you
talk
like
that
i
shall
cry
and
make
a
fool
of
myself
she
said
in
a
broken
manner
it
is
not
so
much
the
thing
that
is
done
or
the
thing
that
is
said
that
matters
but
the
way
of
doing
or
saying
it
in
the
commonplace
pat
on
the
hand
in
the
break
in
the
commonplace
words
there
was
something
that
went
straight
to
my
heart
i
squeezed
her
arm
and
whispered
thank
you
this
sympathy
so
sure
and
yet
so
delicately
conveyed
was
mine
for
the
trouble
of
mounting
the
stairs
that
led
to
her
in
cadogan
gardens
she
seemed
to
be
watching
my
heart
the
whole
time
so
that
without
my
asking
without
my
knowledge
even
she
could
touch
each
sore
spot
as
it
appeared
with
the
healing
finger
for
herself
she
made
no
claims
and
because
she
did
not
in
any
way
declare
herself
to
be
unhappy
i
after
the
manner
of
men
took
her
happiness
for
granted
for
lives
there
a
man
who
does
not
believe
that
an
uncomplaining
woman
has
nothing
to
complain
of
it
is
his
masculine
prerogative
of
density
besides
does
not
he
himself
when
hurt
bellow
like
a
bull
why
he
argues
should
not
wounded
woman
do
the
same
so
when
i
wanted
companionship
i
used
to
sit
in
the
familiar
room
and
make
adolphus
the
chow
dog
shoulder
arms
with
the
poker
and
gossip
restfully
with
lola
who
sprawled
in
her
old
languorous
way
among
the
cushions
of
her
easy
chair
gradually
my
habitual
reserve
melted
from
me
and
at
last
i
gave
her
my
whole
confidence
telling
her
of
my
disastrous
pursuit
of
eumoiriety
of
eleanor
faversham
of
the
attitude
of
society
in
fact
of
most
of
what
i
have
set
down
in
the
preceding
pages
she
was
greatly
interested
in
everything
especially
in
eleanor
faversham
she
wanted
to
know
the
colour
of
her
eyes
and
hair
and
how
she
dressed
women
are
odd
creatures
the
weeks
passed
besides
ministering
to
my
dilapidated
spirit
lola
found
occupation
in
looking
after
the
cattery
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
which
the
little
man
had
left
in
the
charge
of
his
pupil
and
assistant
quast
this
quast
apparently
was
a
faithful
stolid
but
unintelligent
and
incapable
german
who
had
remained
loyally
at
his
post
until
lola
found
him
there
in
a
state
of
the
sum
of
money
with
which
anastasius
had
provided
him
had
been
eked
out
to
the
last
farthing
the
cats
were
in
a
pitiable
condition
quast
in
despair
was
trying
to
make
up
his
dull
mind
whether
to
sell
them
or
eat
them
lola
with
superb
feminine
disregard
of
legal
rights
annexed
the
whole
cattery
maintained
quast
in
his
position
of
pupil
and
assistant
and
informed
the
landlord
that
she
would
be
responsible
for
the
rent
then
she
set
to
work
to
bring
the
cats
into
their
proper
condition
of
sleekness
and
that
done
to
put
them
through
a
systematic
course
of
training
they
had
been
thoroughly
demoralised
she
declared
under
quast
maladministration
and
had
almost
degenerated
into
the
unhistrionic
pussies
of
domestic
life
as
for
hephaestus
the
great
ferocious
tom
he
was
more
like
an
insane
tiger
than
a
cat
he
flew
at
the
gate
over
which
he
used
to
jump
and
clawed
and
bit
it
to
matchwood
and
after
spitting
in
fury
at
the
blazing
hoop
sprang
at
the
unhappy
quast
as
if
he
had
been
the
contriver
of
the
indignities
to
which
he
was
being
subjected
these
tales
of
feline
backsliding
i
used
to
hear
from
lola
and
when
i
asked
her
why
she
devoted
her
energies
to
the
unproductive
education
of
the
uninspiring
animals
she
would
shrug
her
shoulders
and
regard
me
with
a
giaconda
smile
in
the
first
place
it
amuses
me
you
seem
to
forget
i
a
a
tamer
of
beasts
it
my
profession
i
was
trained
to
it
it
the
only
thing
i
can
do
and
it
good
to
feel
that
i
have
lost
my
power
it
odd
but
i
feel
a
different
woman
when
i
impressing
my
will
on
these
wretched
cats
you
must
come
one
of
these
days
and
see
a
performance
when
i
got
them
they
astonish
you
and
then
she
would
add
i
can
write
to
anastasius
and
tell
him
how
his
beloved
cats
are
getting
well
it
was
an
interest
in
her
life
which
heaven
knows
was
not
crowded
with
exciting
incidents
now
that
i
can
look
back
on
these
things
with
a
philosophic
eye
i
can
imagine
no
drearier
existence
than
that
of
a
friendless
unoccupied
woman
in
a
flat
in
cadogan
gardens
at
that
time
i
did
not
realise
this
as
completely
as
i
might
have
done
because
her
old
surgeon
friend
sir
joshua
oldfield
now
and
then
took
her
out
to
dinner
i
considered
she
was
leading
a
cheerful
if
not
a
merry
life
i
smiled
indulgently
at
lola
devotion
to
the
cats
and
congratulated
her
on
having
found
another
means
whereby
to
beguile
the
which
is
the
of
content
i
wish
i
could
find
such
a
means
myself
said
i
not
only
had
the
wish
but
the
imperative
need
to
so
do
to
stand
like
ajax
defying
the
lightning
is
magnificent
but
as
a
continuous
avocation
it
is
wearisome
and
unprofitable
especially
if
carried
on
in
a
tiny
bachelor
suite
an
eyrie
of
a
place
at
the
top
of
a
block
of
flats
in
victoria
street
indeed
if
i
did
not
add
soon
to
the
meagre
remains
of
my
fortune
i
should
not
be
able
to
afford
the
luxury
of
the
bachelor
suite
conscious
of
this
i
left
the
lightning
alone
after
a
last
denunciatory
shake
of
the
fist
and
descended
into
the
busy
ways
of
men
to
look
for
work
thus
i
entered
on
the
second
stage
of
my
career
that
of
a
soldier
of
fortune
at
first
i
was
doubtful
as
to
what
path
to
glory
and
i
could
carve
out
for
myself
hitherto
i
had
been
fortune
darling
instead
of
her
mercenary
and
she
had
most
politely
carved
out
my
paths
for
me
until
she
had
played
her
jade
trick
and
left
me
in
the
ditch
now
things
were
different
i
stood
alone
ironical
ambitionless
still
questioning
the
utility
of
human
effort
yet
determined
to
play
the
game
of
life
to
its
bitter
end
what
could
i
do
it
is
true
that
i
had
been
called
to
the
bar
in
my
tentative
youth
while
i
drafted
documents
for
my
betters
to
pull
to
pieces
and
rewrite
at
the
foreign
office
but
i
had
never
seen
a
brief
and
my
memories
of
gaius
justinian
williams
real
property
and
jurisprudence
were
as
nebulous
as
those
of
the
differential
calculus
over
whose
facetiae
i
had
pondered
during
my
schooldays
the
law
was
as
closed
to
me
as
medicine
i
had
no
profession
i
therefore
drifted
into
the
one
pursuit
for
which
my
training
had
qualified
me
namely
political
journalism
i
had
written
much
in
my
amateur
way
during
my
ten
years
membership
of
parliament
why
i
hardly
know
not
because
i
needed
money
not
because
i
had
thoughts
which
i
burned
to
express
and
certainly
not
through
vain
desire
of
notoriety
perhaps
the
motive
was
twofold
an
ingrained
puckish
delight
in
the
incongruous
it
seemed
incongruous
for
an
airy
epicurean
like
myself
to
spend
stodgy
hours
writing
stodgier
articles
on
pauper
lunacy
and
poor
law
administration
and
the
same
inherited
sense
of
gentlemanly
obligation
to
do
something
for
one
king
and
country
as
made
my
ancestors
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
clothe
themselves
in
uncomfortable
iron
garments
and
go
about
fighting
other
gentlemen
similarly
clad
to
their
own
great
personal
danger
at
any
rate
it
complemented
my
work
at
stephen
and
doubtless
contributed
to
a
reputation
in
the
house
which
i
did
not
gain
through
my
oratory
i
could
therefore
bring
to
editors
the
of
a
fairly
accurate
knowledge
of
current
political
issues
an
appreciation
of
personalities
and
a
philosophical
subrident
estimate
of
the
bubbles
that
are
for
ever
rising
on
the
political
surface
i
found
finch
of
universal
james
of
and
one
or
two
others
more
than
willing
to
give
me
employment
i
put
my
pen
also
at
the
disposal
of
raggles
it
was
as
uplifting
and
about
as
mechanical
as
but
it
involved
less
physical
exertion
and
less
unpleasant
contact
with
my
fellow
creatures
i
could
also
keep
the
ends
of
my
moustache
waxed
which
was
a
great
consolation
my
sister
agatha
commended
my
courage
and
energy
and
lola
read
my
articles
with
a
glowing
enthusiasm
which
compensated
for
lack
of
exact
understanding
but
i
was
not
proud
of
my
position
it
is
one
thing
to
stand
at
the
top
of
a
marble
staircase
and
in
a
debonair
jesting
fashion
to
fling
insincere
convictions
to
a
recipient
world
it
is
another
to
sell
the
same
worthless
commodity
for
money
i
began
to
my
curious
discomfort
to
suspect
that
life
had
a
meaning
after
all
chapter
xviii
one
day
i
had
walked
from
cadogan
gardens
with
a
gadfly
phrase
of
tormenting
my
ears
you
not
quite
alive
even
i
had
spent
most
of
the
day
over
a
weekly
article
for
james
periodical
using
the
same
old
shibboleths
proclaiming
gilead
to
be
the
one
place
for
balm
juggling
with
the
same
old
sophistries
and
proving
that
pope
must
have
been
out
of
his
mind
when
he
declared
that
an
honest
man
was
the
noblest
work
of
god
seeing
that
nobler
than
the
most
honest
man
was
the
disingenuous
government
held
up
to
eulogy
and
i
had
gone
tired
dispirited
out
of
conceit
with
myself
to
lola
for
tea
and
consolation
i
had
not
been
the
merriest
company
i
had
spoken
gloomily
of
the
cosmos
and
when
adolphus
the
chow
dog
had
walked
down
the
room
in
his
hind
legs
i
had
railed
at
the
futility
of
canine
effort
to
lola
who
had
put
forth
all
her
artillery
of
artless
and
harmless
coquetry
in
voice
and
gesture
in
order
to
lure
my
thoughts
into
pleasanter
ways
i
exhibited
the
querulous
grumpiness
of
a
spoiled
village
octogenarian
we
discussed
the
weather
which
was
worth
discussing
for
the
spring
after
long
tarrying
had
come
it
was
early
may
lola
laughed
the
spring
has
got
into
my
it
has
got
into
mine
i
declared
it
never
will
i
wonder
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
then
lola
had
said
my
dear
simon
i
know
you
not
quite
alive
even
i
walked
homewards
pestered
by
the
phrase
what
did
she
mean
by
it
i
stopped
at
the
island
round
the
by
victoria
station
and
bought
a
couple
of
newspapers
there
in
the
centre
of
the
whirlpool
where
swam
dizzily
omnibuses
cabs
whirling
motors
feverish
humans
dirty
newsboys
i
stood
absently
saying
to
myself
you
not
quite
alive
even
a
hand
gripped
my
arm
and
a
cheery
voice
said
hallo
i
started
and
recognised
rex
campion
i
also
said
hallo
and
shook
hands
with
him
we
had
not
met
since
the
days
when
having
heard
of
my
monte
cristo
lavishness
he
had
called
at
the
albany
and
had
beguiled
me
into
giving
a
thousand
pounds
to
his
beloved
barbara
building
the
prodigious
philanthropic
institution
which
he
had
founded
in
the
slums
of
south
lambeth
in
spite
of
my
dead
and
dazed
state
of
being
i
was
pleased
to
see
his
saturnine
face
and
to
hear
his
big
voice
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
always
talked
like
a
megaphone
the
porticoes
of
victoria
station
with
his
salutations
i
greeted
him
less
vociferously
but
with
equal
cordiality
you
looking
very
fit
i
head
that
you
had
gone
through
a
miraculous
operation
how
are
you
perfectly
well
said
i
but
i
been
told
that
i
not
quite
alive
even
he
looked
anxious
remains
of
trouble
not
a
vestige
i
laughed
that
all
right
he
said
breezily
now
come
along
and
hear
milligan
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
i
might
have
work
worries
or
engagements
or
that
the
evening
entertainment
which
he
offered
me
might
be
the
last
thing
i
should
appreciate
his
head
for
the
moment
was
full
of
milligan
and
it
seemed
to
him
only
natural
that
the
head
of
all
humanity
should
be
full
of
milligan
too
i
made
a
wry
face
that
son
of
thunder
milligan
was
a
demagogue
who
had
twice
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
get
into
parliament
in
the
labour
interest
have
you
ever
heard
him
heaven
forbid
said
i
in
my
pride
then
come
he
speaking
in
the
hall
of
the
lambeth
biblical
i
was
tempted
as
i
wanted
company
in
spite
of
my
high
resolve
to
ishmael
i
could
not
kill
a
highly
developed
gregarious
instinct
i
also
wanted
a
text
for
an
article
but
i
wanted
my
dinner
still
more
campion
condemned
the
idea
of
dinner
you
can
have
a
cold
supper
he
roared
like
the
rest
of
i
yielded
campion
dragged
me
helpless
to
a
tram
at
the
top
of
vauxhall
bridge
road
it
will
do
your
mightiness
good
to
mingle
with
the
proletariat
he
grinned
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
had
been
mingling
with
it
in
this
manner
for
some
time
past
or
that
i
repudiated
the
suggestion
of
its
benign
influence
i
entered
the
tram
meekly
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
he
began
i
bet
you
wo
guess
what
i
done
with
your
thousand
pounds
give
you
a
million
as
i
am
a
poor
conjecturer
i
put
on
a
blank
expression
and
shook
my
head
he
waited
for
an
instant
and
then
shouted
with
an
air
of
triumph
i
founded
a
prize
my
boy
a
stroke
of
genius
i
called
it
by
your
name
de
gex
prize
for
housewives
i
did
bother
you
about
it
as
i
knew
you
were
in
a
world
of
worry
but
just
think
of
it
an
annual
prize
of
thirty
pounds
practically
the
interest
for
housewives
his
eyes
flashed
in
his
enthusiasm
he
brought
his
heavy
hand
down
on
my
knee
well
i
asked
not
electrified
by
this
announcement
do
you
see
he
exclaimed
i
throw
the
competition
open
to
the
women
in
the
district
with
certain
qualifications
you
know
i
look
after
all
that
they
enter
their
names
by
a
given
date
and
then
they
start
fair
the
woman
who
keeps
her
home
tidiest
and
her
children
cleanest
collars
the
prize
is
it
splendid
i
agreed
how
many
competitors
and
there
they
are
working
away
sweeping
their
floors
and
putting
up
clean
curtains
and
scrubbing
their
children
noses
till
they
shine
like
rubies
and
making
their
homes
like
little
dutch
pictures
you
see
thirty
pounds
is
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
money
for
poor
people
as
one
mother
of
a
large
family
said
to
me
that
one
could
bury
them
all
quite
beautiful
you
a
wonderful
fellow
said
i
somewhat
enviously
he
gave
an
awkward
laugh
and
tugged
at
his
beard
i
only
happened
to
find
my
job
and
am
doing
it
as
well
as
i
can
he
said
is
very
much
after
all
sometimes
one
gets
discouraged
people
are
such
ungrateful
pigs
but
now
and
again
one
does
help
a
lame
dog
over
a
stile
which
bucks
one
up
you
know
why
do
you
come
down
and
have
a
look
at
us
one
of
these
days
you
been
promising
to
do
so
for
i
will
said
i
with
sudden
interest
you
can
have
a
peep
at
one
or
two
of
the
competing
homes
we
pop
into
them
unexpectedly
at
all
hours
that
a
part
of
the
game
we
a
complicated
system
of
marks
which
i
show
you
of
course
no
woman
knows
how
she
getting
on
otherwise
many
would
lose
how
do
the
men
like
this
disconcerting
ubiquity
of
soap
and
water
they
love
it
he
cried
they
keen
on
the
prize
too
some
think
they
grab
the
lot
and
have
the
devil
own
drunk
when
the
year
up
but
i
look
after
that
besides
when
a
chap
has
been
living
in
the
pride
of
cleanliness
for
a
year
he
get
into
the
way
of
it
and
be
less
likely
to
make
a
beast
of
himself
anyway
i
hope
for
the
best
my
god
de
gex
if
i
did
hope
and
hope
and
hope
he
cried
earnestly
i
do
know
how
i
should
get
through
anything
without
hope
and
a
faith
in
the
ultimate
good
of
the
same
inconvincible
optimist
said
i
yes
thank
heaven
and
you
i
paused
there
came
a
flash
at
the
present
moment
i
said
i
a
perfectly
convincible
we
left
the
tram
and
the
main
thoroughfare
and
turned
into
frowsy
streets
peopled
with
frowsy
men
and
women
and
raucous
with
the
bickering
play
of
frowsy
children
it
was
still
daylight
over
london
the
spring
had
fluttered
its
golden
pinions
and
i
knew
that
in
more
blessed
quarters
in
the
great
parks
in
piccadilly
in
old
palace
yard
half
a
mile
away
its
fragrance
lingered
quickening
blood
already
quickened
by
hope
and
making
happier
hearts
already
happy
but
here
the
ray
of
spring
had
never
penetrated
either
that
day
or
the
days
of
former
springs
so
there
was
no
lingering
fragrance
here
no
one
heeded
the
aspects
of
the
changing
year
save
when
suffocated
by
sweltering
heat
or
frozen
in
the
bitter
cold
or
drenched
by
the
pouring
rain
otherwise
in
these
gray
frowsy
streets
spring
summer
autumn
winter
were
all
the
same
to
the
grey
frowsy
people
it
is
true
that
youth
laughed
pale
animal
boys
and
pale
girls
but
it
laughed
chiefly
at
inane
obscenity
one
of
these
days
when
phonography
is
as
practicable
as
photography
some
one
will
make
accurate
records
in
these
frowsy
streets
and
then
after
the
manner
of
the
elegant
writers
of
bucolics
and
pastorals
publish
such
a
series
of
urbanics
and
pavimentals
phonographic
dialogues
between
the
colins
and
dulcibellas
of
the
pavement
and
the
gutter
as
will
freeze
up
hell
with
horror
an
anemic
flirtatious
group
passed
us
the
girls
in
front
the
boys
behind
good
god
campion
what
you
do
i
asked
pay
them
old
chap
he
returned
quickly
what
the
good
of
that
good
oh
i
see
he
laughed
with
a
touch
of
scorn
it
a
question
of
definition
when
you
see
a
fellow
creature
suffering
and
it
shocks
your
refined
susceptibilities
and
you
say
devil
and
pass
on
you
think
you
have
pitied
him
but
you
have
you
think
pity
a
passive
virtue
it
is
if
you
really
pity
anybody
you
go
mad
to
help
him
you
do
stand
by
with
tears
of
sensibility
running
down
your
cheeks
you
stretch
out
your
hand
because
you
damn
well
got
to
if
he
wo
take
it
or
wipes
you
over
the
head
that
his
you
ca
work
miracles
but
once
in
a
way
he
does
take
it
and
then
well
you
work
like
hell
to
pull
him
through
and
if
you
do
what
bigger
thing
is
there
in
the
world
than
the
salvation
of
a
human
soul
it
worth
living
for
said
i
it
worth
doing
any
confounded
old
thing
for
he
declared
i
envied
campion
as
i
had
envied
no
man
before
he
was
alive
in
heart
and
soul
and
brain
i
was
not
quite
alive
even
yet
but
i
felt
better
for
meeting
him
i
told
him
so
he
tugged
his
beard
again
and
laughed
i
am
a
happy
old
crank
perhaps
that
the
at
the
door
of
the
hall
of
the
lambeth
ethical
society
he
stopped
short
and
turned
on
me
his
jaw
dropped
and
he
regarded
me
in
dismay
i
the
flightiest
and
ass
that
ever
brayed
he
informed
me
i
just
remember
i
sent
miss
faversham
a
ticket
for
this
meeting
about
a
fortnight
ago
i
had
clean
forgotten
it
though
something
uncomfortable
has
been
tickling
the
back
of
my
head
all
the
time
i
miserably
i
hastened
to
reassure
him
miss
faversham
and
i
are
still
good
friends
i
do
think
she
mind
my
nodding
to
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
indeed
she
had
written
me
one
or
two
letters
since
my
recovery
perfect
in
tact
and
sympathy
and
had
put
her
loyal
friendship
at
my
service
even
if
we
meet
i
smiled
nothing
tragic
will
he
expressed
his
relief
but
what
i
asked
is
miss
faversham
doing
in
this
galley
i
suppose
she
is
displaying
an
intelligent
interest
in
modern
thought
he
said
with
boyish
delight
at
the
chance
i
had
offered
him
said
i
with
a
bow
and
we
entered
the
hall
it
was
crowded
the
audience
consisted
of
the
better
class
of
artisans
tradesmen
and
foremen
in
factories
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
clerks
and
unskilled
labouring
men
a
few
women
hats
sprouted
here
and
there
among
the
men
heads
like
weeds
in
a
desert
there
were
women
too
in
proportionately
greater
numbers
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
among
them
i
was
quick
to
notice
eleanor
faversham
as
campion
disliked
platforms
and
high
places
in
synagogues
we
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
near
the
door
he
explained
it
was
also
out
of
consideration
for
me
if
milligan
is
too
strong
for
your
proud
aristocratic
stomach
he
whispered
you
can
cut
and
run
without
attracting
milligan
had
evidently
just
began
his
discourse
i
had
not
listened
to
him
for
five
minutes
when
i
found
myself
caught
in
the
grip
which
he
was
famous
for
fastening
on
his
audience
with
his
subject
nationalisation
of
the
land
and
his
arguments
i
had
been
perfectly
familiar
for
years
as
a
boy
i
had
read
henry
george
progress
and
poverty
with
the
superciliousness
of
the
young
believer
in
the
divine
right
of
landed
gentry
and
before
the
eton
debating
society
i
had
demolished
the
whole
theory
to
my
own
and
every
one
else
satisfaction
later
as
a
practical
politician
i
had
kept
myself
abreast
of
the
socialist
movement
i
did
not
need
john
milligan
whom
my
lingering
flippancy
had
called
a
son
of
thunder
to
teach
me
the
elements
of
the
matter
but
at
this
peculiar
crisis
of
my
life
i
felt
that
in
a
queer
unknown
way
milligan
had
a
message
for
me
it
was
uncanny
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
exposition
of
utopia
with
the
rapt
intensity
of
any
assistant
there
before
whose
captured
spirit
floated
the
vision
of
days
to
come
when
the
land
should
so
flow
with
milk
and
money
that
golden
cheeses
would
be
like
buttercups
for
the
plucking
it
was
not
the
gospel
that
fascinated
me
nor
his
illuminated
prophecy
of
the
millennium
that
produced
the
vibrations
in
my
soul
but
the
surging
passion
of
his
faith
the
tempest
of
his
enthusiasm
i
had
enough
experience
of
public
speaking
to
distinguish
between
the
theatrical
and
the
genuine
in
oratory
here
was
no
soothsayer
but
an
inspired
zealot
he
lived
his
impassioned
creed
in
every
fibre
of
his
frame
and
faculties
he
was
titanic
this
rough
miner
in
his
unconquerable
hope
divine
in
his
yearning
love
of
humanity
when
he
ended
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
second
and
then
a
roar
of
applause
from
the
pale
earnest
faces
a
lump
rose
in
my
throat
campion
clutched
my
knee
a
light
burned
in
his
eyes
well
what
about
boanerges
only
one
thing
said
i
i
wish
i
were
as
alive
as
that
a
negligible
person
proposed
a
vote
of
thanks
to
milligan
after
which
the
hall
began
to
empty
campion
caught
by
a
group
of
his
proletariat
friends
signalled
to
me
to
wait
for
him
and
as
i
waited
i
saw
eleanor
faversham
come
slowly
from
the
platform
down
the
central
gangway
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
me
at
once
for
standing
there
alone
i
must
have
been
a
conspicuous
figure
an
intruder
from
the
gorgeous
west
and
with
a
little
start
of
pleasure
she
hurried
her
pace
i
made
my
way
past
the
chattering
loiterers
in
my
row
and
met
her
we
shook
hands
well
saul
among
the
prophets
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
here
i
waved
my
hand
towards
campion
we
have
the
same
she
glanced
at
him
for
a
swift
instant
and
then
at
me
did
you
like
it
have
you
seen
niagara
did
you
like
it
i
so
glad
she
cried
i
thought
perhaps
she
broke
off
why
have
you
tried
to
see
me
there
are
certain
i
know
she
said
they
there
also
faversham
said
i
mother
is
the
dearest
thing
in
life
she
replied
but
faversham
is
a
she
came
nearer
to
me
in
order
to
allow
a
freer
passage
down
the
gangway
and
also
in
order
to
be
out
of
earshot
of
an
elderly
woman
who
was
obviously
accompanying
her
simon
i
been
a
good
friend
to
you
i
believe
in
you
nothing
will
shake
my
convictions
you
could
look
into
my
eyes
like
that
if
well
you
i
could
said
i
then
why
ca
two
honourable
loyal
people
meet
we
only
need
meet
once
but
i
want
to
tell
you
things
i
ca
write
things
i
say
here
i
also
want
to
hear
of
things
i
think
i
got
a
kind
of
claim
have
i
i
told
you
eleanor
my
letters
letters
are
rubbish
she
declared
with
a
laugh
where
can
we
meet
agatha
is
a
good
soul
said
i
well
fix
it
up
by
telephone
alas
said
i
i
do
run
to
telephones
in
my
eagle
nest
on
himalaya
she
knitted
her
brows
that
not
the
last
address
you
wrote
no
i
replied
smiling
at
this
glimpse
of
the
eleanor
it
was
a
you
incorrigible
she
said
rebukingly
i
do
joke
so
well
in
rags
as
in
silken
motley
i
returned
with
a
smile
but
i
do
my
she
disdained
a
retort
we
arrange
anyhow
with
campion
escaping
from
his
friends
came
up
and
chatted
for
a
minute
then
he
saw
eleanor
and
her
companion
to
their
carriage
now
said
he
a
moment
later
come
to
barbara
and
have
some
supper
you
wo
mind
if
jenkins
joins
us
who
jenkins
i
asked
jenkins
is
an
intelligent
of
sociological
tastes
he
classes
herbert
spencer
benjamin
kidd
and
lombroso
as
light
literature
he
also
helps
us
with
our
young
criminals
i
should
like
you
to
meet
i
should
be
delighted
i
said
so
jenkins
was
summoned
from
a
little
knot
a
few
yards
off
and
duly
presented
whereupon
we
proceeded
to
campion
plain
but
comfortably
furnished
quarters
in
barbara
building
where
he
entertained
us
till
nearly
midnight
with
cold
beef
and
cheese
and
strenuous
conversation
as
i
walked
across
westminster
bridge
on
my
homeward
way
it
seemed
as
if
london
had
grown
less
hostile
big
ben
chimed
twelve
and
there
was
a
distinct
dick
whittington
touch
about
the
music
the
light
on
the
tower
no
longer
mocked
me
as
i
passed
by
the
gates
of
palace
yard
a
policeman
on
duty
recognised
me
and
saluted
i
strode
on
with
a
springier
tread
and
noticed
that
the
next
policeman
who
did
not
know
me
still
regarded
me
with
an
air
of
benevolence
a
pale
moon
shone
in
the
heavens
and
gave
me
shyly
to
understand
that
she
was
as
much
my
moon
as
any
one
else
as
i
turned
into
victoria
street
omnibuses
passed
me
with
a
lurch
of
friendliness
the
ban
was
lifted
i
danced
figuratively
along
the
pavement
what
it
portended
i
did
not
realise
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
spiritual
exhilaration
comparable
only
with
the
physical
exhilaration
i
experienced
in
the
garden
at
algiers
when
my
bodily
health
had
been
finally
established
as
the
body
then
felt
the
need
of
expressing
itself
in
violent
action
in
leaping
and
running
an
impulse
which
i
firmly
subdued
so
now
did
my
spirit
crave
some
sort
of
expression
in
violent
emotion
i
was
in
a
mood
for
enraptured
converse
with
an
archangel
looking
back
i
see
that
campion
friendly
hallo
had
awakened
me
from
a
world
of
shadows
and
set
me
among
realities
the
impact
of
vehement
personality
had
changed
the
conditions
of
my
life
from
static
to
dynamic
and
that
a
providence
which
is
not
always
as
ironical
as
it
pleases
us
to
assert
had
sent
eleanor
faversham
graciousness
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
the
shock
i
see
how
just
was
lola
diagnosis
you
not
quite
alive
even
i
had
been
going
about
in
a
state
of
suspended
spiritual
animation
my
recovery
dated
from
that
evening
chapter
xix
agatha
proved
herself
the
good
soul
i
had
represented
her
to
be
certainly
dear
she
said
when
i
came
the
following
morning
with
my
request
you
can
have
my
boudoir
all
to
i
am
grateful
said
i
and
for
the
first
time
i
forgive
you
for
calling
it
by
that
abominable
it
was
an
old
quarrel
between
us
every
lover
of
language
picks
out
certain
words
in
common
use
that
he
hates
with
an
unreasoning
ferocity
i
change
it
title
if
you
like
she
said
meekly
if
you
do
my
dear
agatha
my
gratitude
will
be
i
remember
a
certain
superior
person
when
tom
and
i
were
engaged
calling
mother
boudoir
the
only
quiet
place
in
the
house
the
she
laughed
with
the
air
of
a
small
bird
who
after
long
waiting
had
at
last
got
even
with
a
hawk
but
i
did
not
even
smile
for
the
only
time
in
our
lives
i
considered
that
agatha
had
committed
a
breach
of
good
taste
i
said
rather
stiffly
it
is
not
going
to
be
a
lovers
meeting
my
she
flushed
it
was
silly
of
me
but
why
should
it
be
a
meeting
she
added
audaciously
if
nothing
had
happened
you
two
would
have
been
married
by
this
time
not
till
oh
yes
you
would
i
should
have
seen
about
that
a
ridiculously
long
engagement
anyhow
it
was
only
your
illness
that
broke
it
off
you
were
told
you
were
going
to
die
you
did
the
only
honourable
and
sensible
thing
both
of
you
now
you
in
splendid
health
again
stop
stop
i
interrupted
you
seem
to
be
entirely
oblivious
of
the
circumstances
i
oblivious
of
no
circumstances
neither
is
eleanor
and
if
she
still
cares
for
you
she
wo
care
twopence
for
the
circumstances
i
know
i
and
to
cut
off
my
reply
she
clapped
the
receiver
of
the
telephone
to
her
ear
and
called
up
eleanor
with
whom
she
proceeded
to
arrange
a
date
for
the
interview
presently
she
screwed
her
head
round
she
says
she
can
come
at
four
this
afternoon
will
that
suit
you
perfectly
said
i
when
she
replaced
the
receiver
i
stepped
behind
her
and
put
my
hands
on
her
shoulders
mother
of
mischief
i
quoted
no
bigger
than
a
wing
and
the
grandmother
is
the
microbe
that
lurks
in
every
woman
she
caught
one
of
my
hands
and
looked
up
into
my
face
you
not
cross
with
me
simon
her
tone
was
that
of
the
old
agatha
i
laughed
remembering
the
policeman
salute
of
the
previous
night
and
noted
this
recovery
of
my
ascendancy
as
another
indication
of
the
general
improvement
in
the
attitude
of
london
of
course
not
tom
tit
said
i
calling
her
by
her
nursery
name
but
i
absolutely
forbid
your
thinking
of
playing
fairy
you
can
forbid
my
playing
she
laughed
and
i
can
obey
you
but
you
ca
prevent
my
thinking
thought
is
sometimes
my
dear
i
retorted
it
is
better
chained
with
this
rebuke
i
left
her
no
doubt
she
considered
a
renewal
of
my
engagement
with
eleanor
faversham
a
romantic
solution
of
difficulties
i
could
only
regard
it
as
preposterous
and
as
i
walked
back
to
victoria
street
i
convinced
myself
that
eleanor
frank
offer
of
friendship
proved
that
such
an
idea
never
entered
her
head
i
took
vehement
pains
to
convince
myself
spring
had
come
like
the
year
i
had
awakened
from
my
lethargy
i
viewed
life
through
new
eyes
i
felt
it
with
a
new
heart
such
vehement
pains
i
was
not
capable
of
taking
yesterday
it
has
never
entered
her
head
i
declared
conclusively
and
yet
as
we
sat
together
a
few
hours
later
in
agatha
little
room
a
doubt
began
to
creep
into
the
corners
of
my
mind
in
her
strong
way
she
had
brushed
away
the
scandal
that
hung
around
my
name
she
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
i
told
her
of
my
loss
of
fortune
my
lunacy
rather
raised
than
lowered
me
in
her
esteem
how
then
was
i
personally
different
from
the
man
she
had
engaged
herself
to
marry
six
months
before
i
remembered
our
parting
i
remembered
her
letters
her
presence
here
was
proof
of
her
unchanging
regard
but
was
it
something
more
was
there
a
hope
throbbing
beneath
that
calm
sweet
surface
to
which
i
did
not
respond
for
it
often
happens
that
the
more
direct
a
woman
is
the
more
in
her
feminine
heart
is
she
elusive
of
that
clean
complexion
which
suggests
the
open
air
eleanor
impressed
you
with
a
sense
of
bodily
and
mental
wholesomeness
her
taste
in
dress
ran
in
the
direction
of
plain
gowns
i
am
told
by
the
way
that
these
can
be
fairly
expensive
and
shrank
instinctively
from
the
frills
and
fripperies
to
which
daughters
of
eve
are
notoriously
addicted
she
spoke
in
a
clear
voice
which
some
called
hard
though
i
never
found
it
so
she
carried
herself
proudly
chaste
in
thought
frank
in
deed
she
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
highly
bred
purely
english
type
of
woman
who
looking
at
facts
squarely
in
the
face
accepts
them
as
facts
and
does
not
allow
her
imagination
to
dally
in
any
atmosphere
wherein
they
may
be
invested
to
this
type
a
vow
is
irrefragable
loyalty
is
inherent
in
her
like
her
blood
she
never
changes
what
feminine
inconsistencies
she
had
at
fifteen
she
retains
at
and
preserves
to
add
to
the
charms
of
her
old
age
she
is
the
exemplary
wife
the
mother
of
children
she
has
sent
her
sons
in
thousands
to
fight
her
country
battles
overseas
those
things
which
lie
in
the
outer
temper
of
her
soul
she
gives
lavishly
that
which
is
hidden
in
her
inner
shrine
has
to
be
wrested
from
her
by
the
one
hand
she
loves
was
mine
that
hand
it
will
be
perceived
that
i
was
beginning
to
take
life
seriously
eleanor
must
have
also
perceived
something
of
the
sort
for
during
our
talk
she
said
irrelevantly
you
changed
in
what
way
i
asked
i
do
know
you
not
the
same
as
you
were
i
seem
to
know
you
better
in
some
ways
and
yet
i
seem
to
know
you
less
why
is
it
i
said
no
one
can
go
through
the
valley
of
the
grotesque
as
i
have
done
without
suffering
some
i
do
see
why
you
should
call
it
valley
of
the
grotesque
i
smiled
at
her
instinctive
rejection
of
the
fanciful
do
you
call
it
the
valley
of
the
shadow
if
you
like
but
you
think
the
attendant
circumstances
were
rather
mediaeval
gargoyley
orcagnesque
do
you
think
the
whole
passage
lacked
the
dignity
which
one
associates
with
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
you
mean
the
murder
she
said
with
a
faint
shiver
that
said
i
might
be
termed
the
central
feature
just
look
at
things
as
they
happened
i
am
condemned
to
death
i
try
to
face
it
like
a
man
and
a
gentleman
i
make
my
arrangements
i
give
up
what
i
can
call
mine
no
longer
i
think
i
will
devote
the
rest
of
my
days
to
performing
such
acts
of
helpfulness
and
charity
as
would
be
impossible
for
a
sound
man
with
a
long
life
before
him
to
undertake
i
do
it
in
a
spirit
refusing
to
take
death
seriously
i
pledge
myself
to
an
act
of
helpfulness
which
i
regard
at
first
as
merely
an
incident
in
my
career
of
beneficence
i
am
gradually
caught
in
the
tangle
of
a
drama
which
at
times
develops
into
sheer
burlesque
and
before
i
can
realise
what
is
going
to
happen
it
turns
into
ghastly
tragedy
i
am
overwhelmed
in
grotesque
disaster
it
is
the
only
word
instead
of
creating
happiness
all
around
me
i
have
played
havoc
with
human
lives
i
stand
on
the
brink
and
look
back
and
see
that
it
is
all
one
gigantic
at
my
expense
i
thank
god
i
am
going
to
die
i
do
die
for
practical
purposes
i
come
back
to
life
and
here
i
am
can
i
be
quite
the
same
person
i
was
a
year
ago
she
reflected
for
a
few
moments
then
she
said
no
you
ca
be
quite
the
same
a
man
of
your
nature
would
either
have
his
satirical
view
of
life
hardened
into
bitter
cynicism
or
he
would
be
softened
by
suffering
and
face
things
with
new
and
nobler
ideals
he
would
either
still
regard
life
as
a
jest
but
instead
of
its
being
an
odd
merry
jest
it
would
be
a
grim
meaningless
hideous
one
or
he
would
see
that
it
was
a
jest
at
all
but
a
full
wonderful
big
reality
i
expressed
myself
badly
but
you
see
what
i
and
what
do
you
think
has
happened
i
asked
i
think
you
have
changed
for
the
i
smiled
inwardly
it
sounded
rather
dull
i
said
with
a
smile
you
never
liked
my
cap
and
bells
no
she
replied
emphatically
what
the
use
of
mockery
see
where
it
led
i
rose
at
her
earnestness
of
myself
and
took
a
couple
of
turns
across
the
room
you
right
i
cried
it
led
me
to
perdition
you
might
make
an
allegory
out
of
my
career
and
entitle
it
mocker
progress
i
paused
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
said
suddenly
why
did
you
from
the
first
refuse
to
believe
what
everybody
else
does
before
i
had
the
chance
of
looking
you
in
the
eyes
she
averted
her
face
you
forget
that
i
had
had
the
chance
of
searching
deep
beneath
the
i
can
not
in
reverence
to
her
set
down
what
she
said
she
found
there
i
stood
humbled
and
rebuked
as
a
man
must
do
when
the
best
in
him
is
laid
out
before
his
sight
by
a
good
woman
a
maidservant
brought
in
tea
set
the
table
and
departed
eleanor
drew
off
her
gloves
and
my
glance
fell
on
her
right
hand
it
good
of
you
to
wear
my
ring
i
said
she
echoed
with
the
tiniest
touch
of
injury
in
her
voice
do
you
think
i
put
it
on
to
just
please
you
it
would
have
been
gracious
of
you
to
do
so
said
i
it
would
she
declared
it
would
have
been
mawkish
and
sentimental
when
we
parted
i
told
you
to
do
what
you
liked
with
the
ring
do
you
remember
you
put
it
on
this
finger
she
waved
her
right
hand
and
there
it
has
stayed
ever
i
caught
the
hand
and
touched
it
lightly
with
my
lips
she
coloured
faintly
two
lumps
of
sugar
and
no
milk
i
think
that
right
she
handed
me
the
it
like
you
not
to
have
i
a
practical
person
she
replied
with
a
laugh
presently
she
said
tell
me
more
about
your
illness
or
rather
your
recovery
i
know
nothing
except
that
you
had
a
successful
operation
which
all
the
london
surgeons
said
was
impossible
who
nursed
you
i
had
a
trained
nurse
said
i
was
madame
brandt
with
you
yes
said
i
she
was
very
good
to
me
in
fact
i
think
i
owe
her
my
hitherto
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
had
caused
me
to
refer
to
lola
no
more
than
was
necessary
and
in
my
narrative
i
had
purposely
left
her
vague
that
a
great
debt
said
eleanor
it
is
you
not
the
man
to
leave
such
a
debt
unpaid
i
try
to
repay
it
by
giving
madame
brandt
my
devoted
her
eyes
never
wavered
as
they
held
mine
that
one
of
the
things
i
wanted
to
know
tell
me
something
about
i
felt
some
surprise
as
eleanor
was
of
a
nature
too
proud
for
curiosity
why
do
you
want
to
know
because
she
interests
me
intensely
is
she
young
about
she
is
a
woman
of
remarkable
describe
i
tried
stumbled
and
halted
the
effort
evoked
in
my
mind
a
picture
of
lola
lithe
seductive
exotic
with
gold
flecks
in
her
dusky
melting
eyes
with
strong
shapely
arms
that
had
as
yet
only
held
me
motherwise
with
her
pantherine
suggestion
of
tremendous
strength
in
languorous
repose
with
her
lazy
gestures
and
parted
lips
showing
the
wonderful
white
even
teeth
with
all
her
fascination
and
charm
a
picture
of
lola
such
as
i
had
not
seen
since
my
emergence
from
the
valley
a
picture
of
lola
generous
tender
wistful
strong
yielding
fragrant
lovable
desirable
amorous
a
picture
of
lola
which
i
could
not
put
before
this
other
woman
equally
brave
and
straight
who
looked
at
me
composedly
out
of
her
calm
blue
eyes
my
description
resolved
itself
into
a
loutish
catalogue
it
is
not
painful
to
you
to
talk
of
her
simon
not
at
all
there
are
not
many
women
going
about
it
is
my
privilege
to
know
am
i
the
other
who
else
i
glad
you
have
the
courage
to
class
madame
brandt
and
myself
why
i
asked
it
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
you
are
honest
with
me
now
tell
me
about
a
few
externals
things
that
do
matter
but
help
one
to
form
an
impression
is
she
educated
from
books
no
from
observation
her
manners
observation
had
educated
accent
she
is
sufficiently
polyglot
to
have
she
dresses
and
talks
and
behaves
generally
like
a
lady
she
does
said
i
in
what
way
then
does
she
differ
from
the
women
of
our
class
she
is
less
schooled
less
reticent
franker
more
natural
what
is
on
her
tongue
to
say
she
temper
i
have
never
heard
her
say
an
angry
word
to
or
of
a
human
creature
she
has
queer
delicacies
of
feeling
for
instance
i
told
her
of
anastasius
papadopoulos
tawdry
gimcrack
presents
which
lola
has
suffered
to
remain
in
her
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
poor
little
wretch
that
very
touching
where
does
she
live
she
has
a
flat
in
cadogan
is
she
in
london
now
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
her
she
said
calmly
i
vow
and
declare
again
that
the
more
straightforward
and
the
less
subtle
temperamental
and
neurotic
are
women
the
more
are
they
baffling
i
had
wondered
for
some
time
whither
the
catechism
tended
and
now
with
a
sudden
jerk
it
stopped
short
at
this
most
unexpected
terminus
it
was
startling
i
rose
and
mechanically
placed
my
empty
on
the
tray
by
her
side
the
wish
my
dear
eleanor
said
i
quite
formally
does
great
credit
to
your
there
was
a
short
pause
marking
an
automatic
close
of
the
subject
deeply
as
i
admired
both
women
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
their
meeting
it
seemed
curiously
indelicate
in
view
both
of
my
former
engagement
to
eleanor
and
of
lola
frank
avowal
of
her
feelings
towards
me
before
what
i
shall
always
regard
as
my
death
it
is
true
that
we
had
never
alluded
to
it
since
my
resurrection
but
what
of
that
lola
feelings
i
was
sure
remained
unaltered
it
also
flashed
on
me
that
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
eleanor
would
not
understand
lola
an
interview
would
develop
into
a
duel
i
pictured
it
for
a
second
and
my
sudden
fierce
partisanship
for
lola
staggered
me
decidedly
an
acquaintance
between
these
two
was
preposterous
the
silence
was
definite
enough
to
mark
a
period
but
not
long
enough
to
cause
embarrassment
eleanor
commented
on
my
present
employment
i
must
find
it
good
to
get
back
to
politics
i
find
it
to
the
contrary
said
i
with
a
laugh
my
convictions
always
lukewarm
are
now
i
do
say
that
the
principles
of
the
party
are
wrong
but
they
wrong
for
me
which
is
if
they
are
not
right
for
me
what
care
i
how
right
they
be
and
as
i
do
believe
in
those
of
the
other
side
i
going
to
give
up
politics
what
will
you
do
i
do
know
i
honestly
do
but
i
have
an
insistent
premonition
that
i
shall
soon
find
myself
doing
something
utterly
idiotic
which
to
me
will
be
the
most
real
thing
in
i
had
indeed
awakened
that
morning
with
an
exhilarating
thrill
of
anticipation
comparable
to
that
of
the
mountain
climber
who
knows
not
what
panorama
of
glory
may
be
disclosed
to
his
eyes
when
he
reaches
the
summit
i
had
whistled
in
my
bath
a
most
unusual
thing
are
you
going
to
turn
socialist
lo
i
willing
to
turn
anything
alive
and
honest
it
matter
what
a
man
professes
so
long
as
he
professes
it
with
all
the
faith
of
all
his
i
broke
into
a
laugh
for
the
echo
of
my
words
rang
comic
in
my
ears
why
do
you
laugh
she
asked
do
you
think
it
funny
to
hear
me
talk
like
a
carlyle
not
a
bit
she
said
seriously
i
ca
undertake
to
talk
like
that
always
i
said
warningly
i
thought
you
said
you
were
going
to
be
so
i
am
but
platitudinous
heaven
forbid
the
little
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
struck
six
eleanor
rose
in
alarm
how
the
time
has
flown
i
must
be
getting
back
well
our
eyes
met
well
said
i
are
we
ever
to
meet
again
it
for
you
to
no
she
said
and
then
very
distinctly
very
deliberately
it
for
i
understood
she
made
the
offer
simply
nobly
unreservedly
my
heart
was
filled
with
great
gratitude
she
was
so
true
so
loyal
so
thorough
why
could
i
not
take
her
at
her
word
i
murmured
i
remember
what
you
she
put
out
her
hand
and
god
bless
you
i
said
i
accompanied
her
to
the
front
door
hailed
a
passing
cab
and
waited
till
she
had
driven
off
was
there
ever
a
sweeter
grander
more
loyal
woman
the
three
little
words
had
changed
the
current
of
my
being
i
returned
to
take
leave
of
agatha
i
found
her
in
the
reading
a
novel
she
twisted
her
head
sideways
and
regarded
me
with
a
air
of
curiosity
eleanor
gone
her
tone
jarred
on
me
i
nodded
and
dropped
into
a
chair
interview
passed
off
satisfactorily
we
were
quite
comfortable
thank
you
the
only
drawback
was
the
tea
why
a
woman
in
your
position
ca
give
people
china
tea
instead
of
that
ceylon
syrup
will
be
a
mystery
to
me
to
my
dying
she
rose
in
her
wrath
and
shook
me
you
the
most
aggravating
wretch
on
earth
my
dear
said
i
gravely
remember
the
moral
tale
of
look
here
simon
she
planted
herself
in
front
of
me
i
not
a
bit
inquisitive
i
do
in
the
least
want
to
know
what
passed
between
you
and
eleanor
but
what
i
would
give
my
ears
to
understand
is
how
you
can
go
through
a
two
hours
conversation
with
the
girl
you
were
engaged
to
a
conversation
which
must
have
affected
the
lives
of
both
of
you
and
then
come
up
to
me
and
talk
drivel
about
china
tea
and
once
on
a
time
my
dear
said
i
i
flattered
myself
on
being
an
artist
in
life
i
am
humbler
now
and
acknowledge
myself
a
wretched
bungling
amateur
but
i
still
recognise
the
value
of
you
hopeless
said
agatha
somewhat
crossly
you
get
more
flippant
and
cynical
every
chapter
xx
i
went
home
to
my
solitary
dinner
and
afterwards
took
down
a
volume
of
emerson
and
tried
to
read
i
thought
the
cool
and
spacious
philosopher
might
allay
a
certain
fever
in
my
blood
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
he
wrote
for
cool
and
spacious
people
like
himself
not
for
corpses
like
me
revivified
suddenly
with
an
overcharge
of
vital
force
i
pitched
him
how
much
more
truly
companionable
is
a
book
than
its
author
i
pitched
him
across
the
room
and
thrusting
my
hands
in
my
pockets
and
stretching
out
my
legs
stared
in
a
certain
wonder
at
myself
i
simon
de
gex
was
in
love
and
dictu
in
love
with
two
women
at
once
it
was
oriental
mormonic
new
century
what
you
will
but
there
it
was
i
am
ashamed
to
avow
that
if
at
that
moment
both
women
had
appeared
before
me
and
said
marry
us
i
should
have
well
reflected
seriously
on
the
proposal
i
had
passed
through
curious
enough
experiences
heaven
knows
already
but
none
so
baffling
as
this
the
two
women
came
alternately
and
knocked
at
my
heart
and
whispered
in
my
ear
their
irrefutable
claims
to
my
love
i
listened
throbbingly
to
each
and
to
each
i
said
i
love
i
was
in
an
extraordinary
psychological
predicament
lola
had
remarked
you
are
not
quite
alive
even
i
had
come
to
complete
life
too
suddenly
this
was
the
result
i
got
up
and
paced
the
which
the
termed
a
and
wondered
whether
i
were
going
mad
it
was
not
as
if
one
woman
represented
the
flesh
and
the
other
the
spirit
then
i
might
have
seen
the
way
to
a
decision
but
both
had
the
large
nature
that
comprises
all
i
could
not
exalt
one
in
any
way
to
the
abasement
of
the
other
all
my
inherited
traditions
prejudices
predilections
all
my
training
ranged
me
on
the
side
of
eleanor
i
was
clamouring
for
the
real
was
she
not
the
incarnation
of
the
real
her
very
directness
piqued
me
to
a
perverse
and
delicious
obliquity
and
i
knew
as
i
knew
when
i
parted
from
her
months
before
that
it
was
only
for
me
to
awaken
things
that
lay
virginally
dormant
on
the
other
hand
stood
lola
with
her
magnetic
seduction
her
rich
atmosphere
her
great
wide
simplicity
of
heart
holding
out
arms
into
which
i
longed
to
throw
myself
it
was
monstrous
abnormal
i
hated
the
abominable
indelicacy
of
weighing
one
against
the
other
as
i
had
hated
the
idea
of
their
meeting
i
paced
my
until
it
shrank
to
the
size
of
a
then
i
clapped
on
my
hat
and
fled
down
into
the
streets
i
jumped
into
the
first
cab
i
saw
and
bade
the
driver
take
me
to
barbara
building
campion
suddenly
occurred
to
me
as
the
best
antidote
to
the
poison
that
had
entered
my
blood
i
found
him
alone
clearing
from
the
table
the
remains
of
supper
in
spite
of
his
soul
hospitable
instincts
he
stared
at
me
why
what
the
yes
i
know
you
surprised
to
see
me
bursting
in
on
you
like
a
wild
animal
i
not
going
to
do
it
every
night
but
this
evening
i
claim
a
bit
of
our
old
claim
it
all
my
dear
de
gex
he
said
cordially
what
can
i
do
for
you
it
was
characteristic
of
campion
to
put
his
question
in
that
form
men
out
of
a
hundred
would
have
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
me
but
campion
who
all
his
life
had
given
wanted
to
know
what
he
could
tell
me
fairy
tales
of
lambeth
and
idylls
of
the
waterloo
bridge
road
or
light
your
pipe
and
talk
to
me
of
he
folded
up
the
tablecloth
and
put
it
in
the
sideboard
drawer
if
it
elegant
distraction
you
want
said
he
i
can
do
better
than
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
me
would
you
like
to
do
a
night
real
work
certainly
said
i
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
named
judd
is
in
the
ramping
stage
of
he
requires
a
couple
of
men
to
hold
him
down
so
as
to
prevent
him
from
getting
out
of
bed
and
smashing
his
furniture
and
his
wife
and
things
i
was
going
to
relieve
one
of
the
fellows
there
now
so
that
he
can
get
a
few
hours
sleep
and
if
you
like
to
come
and
relieve
the
other
you
be
doing
a
good
action
but
i
warn
you
it
wo
be
i
in
the
mood
for
anything
i
said
you
come
of
that
splendid
he
shouted
i
hardly
thought
you
were
in
earnest
wait
till
i
telephone
for
some
medicine
to
be
sent
up
from
the
dispensary
i
promised
to
take
it
round
with
he
telephoned
instructions
and
presently
a
porter
brought
in
the
medicine
campion
explained
that
it
had
been
prescribed
by
the
doctor
attached
to
the
institution
who
was
attending
the
case
you
must
come
and
see
the
working
of
our
surgery
and
dispensary
he
cried
enthusiastically
we
charge
those
who
can
afford
a
sixpence
for
visit
and
medicine
those
who
ca
are
provided
after
inquiry
with
coupons
we
do
want
to
encourage
the
to
get
their
medical
advice
gratis
or
we
would
be
able
to
cope
with
the
really
poor
we
pay
the
doctor
a
fixed
salary
and
the
fees
go
to
the
general
fund
of
the
building
so
it
does
matter
a
hang
to
him
whether
a
patient
pays
or
you
must
be
proud
of
all
this
campion
i
said
in
a
way
he
replied
lighting
his
pipe
but
it
mainly
a
question
of
money
my
poor
old
father
money
which
he
worked
for
not
i
reminded
him
that
other
sons
had
been
known
to
put
their
poor
old
father
money
to
baser
uses
i
suppose
barbara
is
more
useful
to
the
community
that
steam
yachts
or
racing
stables
but
there
you
see
i
hate
yachting
because
i
always
and
i
scarcely
know
which
end
of
a
horse
you
put
the
bridle
on
every
man
to
his
job
this
is
mine
i
like
i
wonder
whether
holding
down
people
suffering
from
is
my
job
said
i
if
so
i
afraid
i
sha
like
if
it
really
your
job
replied
campion
you
will
you
must
you
ca
help
it
god
made
man
it
was
only
an
hour
or
two
later
when
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
came
into
practical
touch
with
human
misery
that
i
recognised
the
truth
of
campion
perfervid
optimism
no
one
could
like
our
task
that
night
in
its
outer
essence
for
a
time
it
revolted
me
the
atmosphere
of
the
close
dirty
room
bedroom
kitchen
bathroom
laundry
all
in
one
the
home
of
man
wife
and
two
children
caught
me
by
the
throat
it
was
sour
the
physical
contact
with
the
flesh
of
the
unclean
gibbering
shivering
maniacal
brute
on
the
foul
bed
was
unutterably
repugnant
to
me
now
and
again
during
intervals
of
comparative
calm
i
was
forced
to
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
to
breathe
the
air
of
the
street
even
that
was
tainted
for
a
shop
across
the
way
and
a
next
door
billowed
forth
their
nauseating
odours
after
a
while
access
to
the
window
was
denied
me
a
mattress
and
some
rude
coverings
were
stretched
beneath
it
the
children
bed
on
which
we
persuaded
the
helpless
dreary
wife
to
lie
down
and
try
to
rest
a
neighbour
had
taken
in
the
children
for
the
night
the
wife
was
a
skinny
lined
woman
of
in
her
attitude
of
hopeless
incompetence
she
shed
around
her
an
atmosphere
of
unspeakable
depression
although
i
could
not
get
to
the
window
i
was
glad
when
she
lay
down
and
spared
me
the
sight
of
her
moving
fecklessly
about
the
room
or
weeping
huddled
up
on
a
wooden
chair
and
looking
more
like
a
than
a
woman
the
poor
wretch
on
the
bed
was
a
journeyman
tailor
who
when
sober
could
earn
fair
wages
the
cry
of
the
wife
before
campion
awed
her
into
comparative
silence
was
a
monotonous
upbraiding
of
her
husband
for
bringing
them
down
to
this
poverty
it
seemed
impossible
to
touch
her
intelligence
and
make
her
understand
that
no
words
from
her
or
any
one
could
reach
his
consciousness
his
violence
his
screams
his
threats
the
horrors
of
his
fear
left
her
unmoved
we
were
there
to
guard
her
from
physical
danger
and
that
to
her
was
all
that
mattered
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
the
nausea
left
me
i
felt
braced
by
the
grimness
of
the
thing
and
during
the
paroxysms
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
anything
but
the
mechanical
work
in
hand
it
was
all
that
campion
and
i
both
fairly
men
could
do
to
keep
the
puny
little
tailor
in
his
bed
horrible
shapes
menaced
him
from
which
he
fought
madly
to
escape
he
writhed
and
shrieked
with
terror
once
he
caught
my
hand
in
his
teeth
and
bit
it
and
campion
had
some
difficulty
in
relaxing
the
wretch
jaw
between
the
paroxysms
campion
and
i
sat
on
the
bed
watching
him
scarcely
exchanging
a
word
the
wife
poor
creature
whimpered
on
her
mattress
it
was
not
a
pleasant
vigil
it
lasted
till
the
grey
dawn
crept
in
pitilessly
intensifying
the
squalor
of
the
room
and
until
the
dawn
was
broadening
into
daylight
then
two
of
men
from
barbara
building
arrived
to
relieve
us
before
we
went
however
the
neighbour
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
children
came
in
to
help
the
slatternly
wife
light
a
fire
and
make
some
tea
i
have
enjoyed
few
things
more
than
the
warm
bitter
stuff
which
i
drank
out
of
the
broken
mug
in
that
strange
and
depressing
company
i
went
out
into
the
street
with
racked
head
and
nerves
and
muscles
campion
kept
his
cloth
cap
in
his
hand
allowing
the
morning
wind
to
ruffle
his
shaggy
black
hair
and
drew
a
long
breath
i
think
the
worst
is
over
now
as
soon
as
he
can
be
moved
i
get
him
down
to
the
annexe
at
broadstairs
the
sea
air
will
pull
him
is
it
rather
hopeless
i
asked
he
turned
on
me
nothing
hopeless
if
you
once
start
the
hopeless
game
down
here
you
better
distribute
cyanide
of
potassium
instead
of
coals
and
groceries
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
that
man
decent
again
and
by
george
i
going
to
do
it
fancy
those
two
weaklings
producing
healthy
offspring
but
they
have
two
of
the
most
intelligent
kids
in
the
district
if
you
hold
up
your
hands
and
say
it
awful
to
contemplate
their
upbringing
you
speaking
the
blatant
truth
the
contemplation
that
awful
but
why
contemplate
when
you
can
do
something
i
admitted
the
justice
of
the
remark
he
went
on
look
at
yourself
now
if
you
had
gone
in
with
me
last
night
and
just
stared
at
the
poor
devil
howling
with
in
that
filthy
place
have
come
out
sick
and
said
it
was
awful
instead
of
that
you
buckled
to
and
worked
and
threw
off
everything
save
our
common
humanity
and
have
got
interested
in
the
judds
in
spite
of
yourself
you
go
and
see
them
again
and
do
what
you
can
for
them
wo
you
i
was
not
in
a
merry
mood
but
i
laughed
campion
had
read
the
intention
that
had
vaguely
formulated
itself
in
the
back
of
my
mind
of
course
i
will
i
said
we
walked
on
a
few
steps
down
the
still
silent
disheartening
street
without
speaking
then
he
tugged
his
beard
and
glanced
at
me
quickly
see
here
said
he
the
more
sensible
people
i
can
get
in
to
help
us
the
better
would
you
like
me
to
hand
you
over
the
judd
family
this
was
startling
to
the
amateur
philanthropist
but
it
is
the
way
of
all
professionals
to
regard
their
own
business
as
of
absorbing
interest
to
the
outside
world
the
stockbroking
mind
can
not
conceive
a
sane
man
indifferent
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
money
market
and
to
the
professional
cricketer
the
wide
earth
revolves
around
a
wicket
how
in
the
world
could
i
be
fairy
godfather
to
the
judd
family
campion
took
my
competence
for
granted
you
may
not
understand
exactly
what
i
mean
my
dear
campion
said
i
but
i
attribute
the
most
unholy
disasters
of
my
life
to
a
ghastly
attempt
of
mine
to
play
deputy
but
who
asking
you
to
play
deputy
providence
he
shouted
it
the
very
last
idiot
thing
i
want
done
i
want
you
to
do
certain
definite
practical
work
for
that
family
under
the
experienced
direction
of
the
authorities
at
barbara
building
there
do
you
understand
now
very
well
i
do
anything
you
thus
it
befell
that
i
undertook
to
look
after
the
moral
material
and
spiritual
welfare
of
the
family
of
an
alcoholic
tailor
by
the
name
of
judd
who
dwelt
in
a
vile
slum
in
south
lambeth
my
head
was
full
of
the
prospect
when
i
awoke
at
noon
for
i
had
gone
exhausted
to
sleep
as
soon
as
i
reached
home
if
goodwill
backed
by
the
experience
of
building
could
do
aught
towards
the
alleviation
of
human
misery
i
determined
that
it
should
be
done
and
there
was
much
misery
to
be
alleviated
in
the
judd
family
i
had
no
clear
notion
of
the
means
whereby
i
was
to
accomplish
this
but
i
knew
that
it
would
be
a
philanthropic
pursuit
far
different
from
my
previous
eumoirous
wanderings
abut
london
when
with
a
mind
conscious
of
i
distributed
embarrassing
notes
to
the
poor
and
needy
i
had
known
what
comfortable
gentleman
does
not
that
within
easy
walking
distance
of
his
london
home
thousands
of
human
beings
live
like
the
beasts
that
perish
but
never
before
had
i
spent
an
intimate
night
in
one
of
the
foul
dens
where
the
living
and
perishing
take
place
the
awful
pity
of
it
entered
my
soul
so
deeply
was
i
impressed
with
the
responsibility
of
what
i
had
undertaken
so
grimly
was
i
haunted
by
the
sight
of
the
pallid
howling
travesty
of
a
man
and
the
whimpering
woman
that
the
memory
of
the
conflicting
emotions
that
had
driven
me
to
campion
the
night
before
returned
to
me
with
a
shock
it
strikes
me
i
murmured
as
i
shaved
that
i
am
living
very
intensely
indeed
here
am
i
in
love
with
two
women
at
once
and
almost
hysterically
enthusiastic
over
a
delirious
then
i
cut
my
cheek
and
murmured
no
more
until
the
operation
was
concluded
i
had
arranged
to
accompany
lola
that
afternoon
to
the
zoological
gardens
this
was
a
favourite
resort
of
hers
she
was
on
intimate
terms
with
keepers
and
animals
and
her
curious
magnetism
allowed
her
to
play
such
tricks
with
lions
and
tigers
and
other
ferocious
beasts
as
made
my
blood
run
cold
as
for
the
bears
they
greeted
her
approach
with
shrieking
demonstrations
of
affection
on
such
occasions
i
felt
the
same
curious
physical
antipathy
as
i
did
when
she
had
dominated
cat
she
seemed
to
enter
another
sphere
of
being
in
which
neither
i
nor
anything
human
had
a
place
with
some
such
dim
thoughts
in
my
head
i
reached
her
door
in
cadogan
gardens
the
sight
of
her
electric
brougham
that
stood
waiting
switched
my
thoughts
into
another
groove
but
one
running
oddly
parallel
electric
broughams
also
carried
her
out
of
my
sphere
i
had
humbly
performed
the
journey
thither
in
an
omnibus
she
received
me
in
her
big
expansive
way
lord
how
good
it
is
to
see
you
i
was
getting
the
i
was
going
to
say
blind
hump
but
you
do
like
it
i
was
going
to
turn
crazy
and
bite
the
why
i
asked
with
masculine
directness
i
been
trying
to
educate
myself
to
read
poetry
look
here
she
caught
a
small
octavo
volume
from
the
table
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
it
proved
to
me
that
it
was
no
use
if
i
understand
poetry
i
could
understand
anything
it
was
no
good
trying
to
educate
myself
i
gave
it
up
and
then
i
got
what
you
do
like
me
to
call
the
you
dear
lola
i
cried
laughing
i
do
believe
any
one
has
ever
made
head
or
tail
out
of
there
once
was
a
man
who
said
there
were
only
two
intelligible
lines
in
the
poem
the
first
and
the
last
and
that
both
were
lies
will
may
hear
sordello
story
told
and
would
has
heard
sordello
story
told
do
worry
about
not
understanding
do
you
not
a
bit
said
i
that
a
comfort
she
said
with
a
generous
sigh
of
relief
how
well
you
looking
she
cried
suddenly
you
a
different
man
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
i
grown
quite
good
delightful
so
am
i
quite
alive
now
thank
she
looked
it
in
spite
of
the
black
outdoor
costume
but
there
was
a
dash
of
white
at
her
throat
and
some
white
lilies
of
the
valley
in
her
bosom
and
a
white
feather
in
her
great
black
hat
poised
with
a
gainsborough
swagger
on
the
mass
of
her
bronze
hair
it
the
spring
she
added
yes
said
i
it
the
she
approached
me
and
brushed
a
few
specks
of
dust
from
my
shoulder
you
want
a
new
suit
of
clothes
dear
me
said
i
glancing
hastily
over
the
blue
serge
suit
in
which
i
had
lounged
at
mustapha
superieur
i
suppose
i
it
occurred
to
me
that
my
wardrobe
generally
needed
replenishing
i
had
been
unaccustomed
to
think
of
these
things
the
excellent
rogers
and
his
predecessors
having
done
most
of
the
thinking
for
me
i
go
to
poole
at
once
said
i
and
then
it
struck
me
to
my
whimsical
dismay
that
in
the
present
precarious
state
of
my
finances
especially
in
view
of
my
decision
to
abandon
political
journalism
in
favour
of
i
knew
not
what
occupation
i
could
not
afford
to
order
clothes
largely
from
a
fashionable
tailor
i
should
have
mentioned
it
said
lola
apologetically
but
always
so
spick
and
and
now
i
getting
shabby
i
threw
back
my
head
and
laughed
at
the
new
and
comical
conception
of
simon
de
gex
down
at
heel
oh
not
shabby
echoed
lola
yes
my
dear
the
days
of
purple
and
fine
linen
are
have
to
put
up
with
me
in
a
threadbare
coat
and
frayed
cuffs
and
ragged
hems
to
my
lola
declared
that
i
was
talking
rubbish
not
quite
such
rubbish
as
you
may
think
my
dear
shall
you
mind
it
would
break
my
heart
but
why
do
you
talk
so
you
ca
be
as
poor
as
that
her
face
manifested
such
tragic
concern
that
i
laughed
besides
the
idea
of
personal
poverty
amused
me
when
i
gave
up
my
political
work
i
should
only
have
what
i
had
saved
from
my
wreck
some
two
hundred
a
year
to
support
me
until
i
should
find
some
other
means
of
livelihood
it
was
enough
to
keep
me
from
starvation
and
the
little
economies
i
had
begun
to
practise
afforded
me
enjoyment
on
the
other
hand
how
folks
regulated
their
so
as
to
live
on
two
hundred
a
year
i
had
but
a
dim
notion
in
the
course
of
our
walk
from
barbara
building
to
the
judds
the
night
before
i
had
asked
campion
he
had
laughed
somewhat
grimly
i
do
know
i
do
run
an
asylum
for
spendthrift
plutocrats
but
if
you
want
to
see
how
people
live
and
bring
up
large
families
on
fifteen
shillings
a
week
i
can
show
you
heaps
of
this
i
felt
would
in
itself
be
knowledge
of
the
deepest
interest
but
it
would
in
no
way
aid
me
to
solve
my
own
economic
difficulty
i
was
always
being
brought
up
suddenly
against
the
problem
in
some
form
or
another
and
as
i
say
it
caused
me
considerable
amusement
i
shall
go
on
happily
enough
said
i
reassuringly
in
the
meantime
let
us
go
and
see
the
lions
and
we
started
the
electric
brougham
glided
along
comfortably
through
the
sunlit
streets
a
feeling
of
physical
and
spiritual
content
stole
over
me
our
hands
met
and
lingered
a
long
time
in
a
sympathetic
clasp
whatever
fortune
held
in
store
for
me
here
at
least
i
had
an
inalienable
possession
for
some
time
we
said
nothing
and
when
our
eyes
met
she
smiled
i
think
she
had
never
felt
my
heart
so
near
to
hers
at
last
we
broke
the
silence
and
talked
of
ordinary
things
i
told
her
of
my
vigil
overnight
and
my
undertaking
to
look
after
the
judds
she
listened
with
great
interest
when
i
had
finished
my
tale
she
said
almost
passionately
oh
i
wish
i
could
do
something
like
that
you
why
not
i
came
from
those
people
my
grandfather
swept
the
cages
in
jamrach
down
by
the
docks
he
died
of
drink
he
used
to
live
in
one
horrible
squalid
room
near
by
i
remember
my
father
taking
me
to
see
him
when
i
was
a
little
girl
we
ourselves
were
very
much
better
off
at
that
time
i
been
through
it
she
shivered
i
know
what
that
awful
poverty
is
sometimes
it
seems
immoral
of
me
to
live
luxuriously
as
i
do
now
without
doing
a
hand
turn
to
a
son
my
dear
said
i
there
no
need
to
reproach
but
i
think
it
might
be
my
she
replied
earnestly
if
only
i
could
learn
why
have
you
tried
then
i
been
lazy
and
the
opportunity
has
come
my
i
introduce
you
to
campion
i
said
and
doubtless
he
be
able
to
find
something
for
you
to
do
he
has
made
a
science
of
the
matter
take
you
down
to
see
will
you
certainly
said
i
there
was
a
pause
then
an
idea
struck
me
i
wonder
my
dear
lola
whether
you
could
apply
that
curious
power
you
have
over
savage
animals
to
the
taming
of
the
more
brutal
of
i
wonder
she
said
thoughtfully
i
should
like
to
see
you
seize
a
drunken
costermonger
in
the
act
of
jumping
on
his
wife
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
reduce
him
to
such
pulp
that
he
sat
up
on
his
tail
and
oh
simon
she
exclaimed
reproachfully
i
quite
thought
you
were
so
i
am
my
dear
i
returned
quickly
as
serious
as
i
can
she
laughed
do
you
remember
the
first
day
you
came
to
see
me
you
said
that
i
could
train
any
human
bear
to
dance
to
whatever
tune
i
pleased
i
wonder
if
the
same
thought
was
at
the
back
of
your
it
was
it
was
a
bad
and
villainous
thought
i
came
under
the
impression
that
you
were
a
dangerous
and
i
not
oh
that
spring
day
that
delicious
tingle
in
the
air
that
laughing
impertinence
of
the
budding
trees
in
the
park
through
which
we
were
then
driving
that
enveloping
sense
of
fragrance
and
the
nearness
and
the
dearness
of
her
oh
that
overcharge
of
vitality
i
leaned
my
head
to
hers
so
that
my
lips
nearly
touched
her
ear
my
voice
shook
you
a
seductress
and
a
witch
and
a
sorcerer
and
an
the
blood
rose
to
her
dark
face
she
half
closed
her
eyes
what
else
am
i
she
murmured
but
alas
i
had
not
time
to
answer
for
the
brougham
stopped
at
the
gates
of
the
zoological
gardens
we
both
awakened
from
our
foolishness
my
hand
was
on
the
when
she
checked
me
what
the
good
of
a
mind
if
you
ca
change
it
i
do
feel
in
a
mood
for
wild
beasts
and
i
know
you
do
care
to
see
me
fooling
about
with
them
i
would
much
rather
sit
quiet
and
talk
to
with
a
woman
who
wants
to
sacrifice
herself
there
is
no
disputing
besides
i
had
no
desire
to
dispute
i
acquiesced
we
agreed
to
continue
our
drive
we
go
round
by
hampstead
heath
she
said
to
the
chauffeur
as
soon
as
we
were
in
motion
again
she
drew
ever
so
little
nearer
and
said
in
her
lowest
richest
notes
and
with
a
coquetry
that
was
bewildering
on
account
of
its
frankness
what
were
we
talking
of
before
we
pulled
up
i
do
know
what
we
were
talking
of
i
said
but
we
seem
to
have
trodden
on
the
fringe
of
a
ca
we
tread
on
it
again
she
laughed
happily
you
have
only
to
cast
the
spell
of
your
witchery
over
me
she
drew
yet
a
little
nearer
and
whispered
i
trying
to
do
it
as
hard
as
i
an
adorable
softness
came
into
her
eyes
and
her
hand
instinctively
closed
round
mine
in
its
boneless
clasp
the
long
longing
of
the
woman
vibrated
from
her
in
waves
that
shook
me
to
my
soul
my
senses
swam
her
face
quivered
glorious
before
me
in
a
black
world
her
lips
were
parted
careless
of
all
the
eyes
in
all
the
houses
in
the
avenue
road
john
wood
and
in
the
head
of
a
telegraph
boy
whom
i
only
noticed
afterwards
i
kissed
her
on
the
lips
all
the
fulness
and
strength
of
life
danced
through
my
veins
i
told
you
i
was
quite
alive
i
said
with
idiotic
exultation
she
closed
her
eyes
and
leaned
back
why
did
you
do
that
she
murmured
because
i
love
you
said
i
it
has
come
at
where
we
drove
i
have
no
recollection
presumably
an
impression
of
green
rolling
plain
with
soft
uplands
in
the
distance
signified
that
we
passed
along
hampstead
heath
the
side
thoroughfare
with
villa
residences
on
either
side
may
have
been
kilburn
high
road
the
flourishing
busy
noisy
suburb
may
have
been
kilburn
the
street
leading
thence
to
the
marble
arch
may
have
been
maida
vale
to
me
they
were
paths
in
dreamland
we
spoke
but
little
and
what
we
did
say
was
in
the
simple
commonplace
language
which
all
men
use
in
the
big
crises
of
life
there
was
no
doubt
now
of
my
choice
i
loved
her
love
had
come
to
me
at
last
that
was
all
i
knew
at
that
hour
and
all
i
cared
to
know
lola
was
the
first
to
awake
from
dreamland
she
shivered
i
asked
whether
she
felt
cold
no
i
ca
believe
that
you
love
me
i
ca
i
i
smiled
in
a
masterful
way
i
can
soon
show
you
that
i
she
shook
her
head
i
afraid
simon
i
what
of
why
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
explain
i
do
know
how
to
i
been
wrong
horribly
wrong
i
she
gripped
her
hands
together
and
looked
down
at
them
i
bent
forward
so
as
to
see
her
face
which
was
full
of
pain
but
dearest
of
all
women
i
cried
what
in
the
world
have
you
to
be
ashamed
of
she
paused
moistened
her
lips
with
her
tongue
and
then
broke
out
i
tell
you
a
decent
lady
like
your
eleanor
faversham
would
tell
but
i
ca
keep
these
things
in
did
you
begin
by
saying
i
was
a
seductress
no
no
let
me
talk
did
you
say
i
could
make
a
man
do
what
i
wanted
well
i
wanted
you
to
kiss
me
and
now
you
done
it
you
think
you
love
me
but
you
do
you
you
talking
the
wickedest
nonsense
that
ever
proceeded
out
of
the
lips
of
a
loving
woman
i
said
aghast
i
repeat
in
the
most
solemn
way
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
in
common
decency
you
could
say
again
i
saw
the
futility
of
disputation
i
put
my
hand
on
hers
time
will
show
dear
at
any
rate
we
have
had
our
hour
of
i
wish
we
had
she
said
do
you
see
it
was
only
my
sorcery
as
you
call
it
that
took
us
there
i
meant
us
to
at
last
we
reached
cadogan
gardens
i
descended
and
handed
her
out
and
we
entered
the
hall
of
the
mansions
the
porter
stood
with
the
open
i
coming
up
to
knock
all
this
foolishness
out
of
your
no
do
please
for
heaven
sake
she
whispered
imploringly
i
must
be
alone
to
think
it
all
out
it
only
because
i
love
you
so
and
do
come
to
see
me
for
a
day
or
two
say
two
days
this
is
wednesday
come
on
friday
you
think
it
over
as
well
and
if
it
really
true
know
then
when
you
come
dear
make
gray
drive
you
wherever
you
want
to
she
wrung
my
hand
turned
and
entered
the
lift
the
gates
swung
to
and
she
mounted
out
of
sight
i
went
slowly
back
to
the
brougham
and
gave
the
chauffeur
the
address
of
my
eyrie
he
touched
his
hat
i
got
in
and
we
drove
off
and
then
for
the
first
time
it
struck
me
that
an
gentleman
with
a
beggarly
two
hundred
a
year
ought
not
in
spite
of
his
quarterings
to
be
contemplating
marriage
with
a
wealthy
woman
who
kept
an
electric
brougham
the
thought
hit
me
like
a
stone
in
the
midriff
what
on
earth
was
to
be
done
my
pride
rose
up
like
the
ex
in
the
melodrama
and
forbade
the
banns
to
live
on
money
the
idea
was
intolerable
equally
intolerable
was
the
idea
of
earning
an
income
by
means
against
the
honesty
of
which
my
soul
clamoured
aloud
good
god
i
cried
is
life
now
i
got
to
it
nothing
but
an
infinite
series
of
dilemmas
no
sooner
am
i
off
one
than
i
on
another
no
sooner
do
i
find
that
lola
and
not
eleanor
faversham
is
the
woman
sent
down
by
heaven
to
be
my
mate
than
i
realise
the
same
old
dilemma
lola
on
one
horn
and
eleanor
replaced
on
the
other
by
pride
and
honour
and
all
sorts
of
considerations
life
is
the
very
deuce
said
i
with
a
wry
appreciation
of
the
subtlety
of
language
why
did
lola
say
your
eleanor
faversham
i
had
enough
to
think
over
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
but
i
slept
peacefully
light
loves
had
come
and
gone
in
the
days
past
but
now
for
the
first
time
love
that
was
not
light
had
come
into
my
life
chapter
xxi
the
lord
will
find
a
way
out
of
the
dilemma
said
i
confidently
to
myself
as
i
neared
cadogan
gardens
two
days
after
the
revelatory
drive
lola
is
in
love
with
me
and
i
am
in
love
with
lola
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
us
apart
but
my
pride
over
a
matter
of
a
few
i
felt
peculiarly
jaunty
i
had
just
posted
to
finch
the
last
of
the
articles
i
had
agreed
to
write
for
his
reactionary
review
and
only
a
couple
of
articles
for
another
journal
remained
to
be
written
in
order
to
complete
my
literary
engagements
soon
i
should
be
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
in
which
i
had
been
a
slave
at
first
willingly
and
now
rebelliously
from
my
cradle
the
great
wide
world
with
its
infinite
opportunities
for
development
received
my
liberated
spirit
i
had
broken
the
shackles
of
caste
i
had
thrown
off
the
perfumed
garments
of
epicureanism
the
vesture
of
my
servitude
my
emotions
once
stifled
in
the
enervating
atmosphere
now
awake
fresh
and
strong
in
the
free
air
i
was
elemental
the
man
wanting
the
woman
and
i
was
happy
because
i
knew
i
was
going
to
get
her
such
must
be
the
state
of
being
of
a
dragonfly
on
a
sunny
day
and
shall
i
confess
it
i
had
obeyed
the
instinct
and
attired
myself
in
the
most
resplendent
raiment
in
my
wardrobe
my
morning
coat
was
still
irreproachable
my
patent
leather
boots
still
gleamed
and
having
had
some
business
in
piccadilly
i
had
stepped
into
my
hatter
and
emerged
with
my
silk
hat
newly
ironed
i
positively
strutted
along
the
pavement
for
two
days
i
had
not
seen
her
or
heard
from
her
or
written
to
her
i
had
scrupulously
respected
her
wishes
foolish
though
they
were
now
i
was
on
my
way
to
convince
her
that
my
love
was
not
a
moment
surge
of
the
blood
on
a
spring
afternoon
i
would
take
her
into
my
arms
at
once
after
the
way
of
men
and
she
after
the
way
of
women
would
yield
adorably
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
i
tasted
in
anticipation
the
bliss
of
that
first
embrace
as
if
i
had
never
kissed
a
woman
in
my
life
and
indeed
what
woman
had
i
kissed
with
the
passion
that
now
ran
through
my
veins
in
that
embrace
all
the
ghosts
of
the
past
women
would
be
laid
for
ever
and
a
big
and
lusty
future
would
make
glorious
beginning
by
heaven
i
cried
almost
articulately
with
the
splendour
of
the
world
at
my
command
why
should
i
not
write
plays
novels
poems
rhapsodies
so
as
to
tell
the
blind
groping
loveless
people
what
it
is
like
take
me
up
to
madame
brandt
said
i
to
the
madame
brandt
is
not
in
town
sir
said
the
man
i
looked
at
him
not
in
town
i
think
she
has
gone
abroad
sir
she
left
with
a
lot
of
luggage
yesterday
and
her
maid
and
now
the
flat
is
shut
impossible
i
cried
aghast
the
porter
smiled
i
can
only
tell
you
what
has
happened
where
has
she
gone
to
i
could
say
her
letters
has
she
left
no
address
to
which
they
are
to
be
forwarded
not
with
me
did
she
say
when
she
was
coming
back
no
sir
but
she
dismissed
her
cook
with
a
month
wages
so
it
seems
as
though
she
was
gone
for
a
good
what
time
yesterday
did
she
leave
after
lunch
the
cabman
was
to
drive
her
to
victoria
london
chatham
and
dover
that
looks
like
the
to
paris
said
i
but
the
knew
nothing
of
this
he
had
given
me
all
the
information
in
his
power
i
thanked
him
and
went
out
into
the
sunshine
a
blinking
dazed
bewildered
and
piteously
crushed
man
she
had
gone
without
drum
or
trumpet
maid
and
baggage
and
all
having
dismissed
her
cook
and
shut
up
the
flat
it
was
incredible
i
wandered
aimlessly
about
chelsea
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
should
i
go
to
paris
and
bring
her
back
by
main
force
but
how
did
i
know
that
she
had
gone
to
paris
and
if
she
was
there
how
could
i
discover
her
address
suddenly
an
idea
struck
me
she
would
not
have
left
quast
and
the
cattery
in
the
same
unceremonious
fashion
to
get
on
as
best
they
might
she
would
have
given
quast
money
and
directions
at
any
rate
he
would
know
more
than
the
of
the
mansions
i
decided
to
go
to
him
forthwith
by
means
of
trains
and
omnibuses
i
arrived
at
the
house
in
the
little
street
off
rosebery
avenue
clerkenwell
where
the
maker
of
gymnastic
appliances
had
his
being
i
knocked
at
the
door
a
grubby
man
appeared
i
inquired
for
quast
quast
had
left
that
morning
in
a
van
taking
his
cages
of
cats
with
him
he
had
gone
abroad
and
was
never
coming
back
again
not
if
he
knew
it
said
the
grubby
man
the
cats
were
poison
and
quast
was
a
foreigner
and
it
would
cost
him
a
year
rent
to
put
the
place
in
order
again
whereupon
he
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
and
left
me
disconsolate
on
the
doorstep
the
only
other
person
with
whom
i
knew
lola
to
be
on
friendly
terms
was
sir
joshua
oldfield
i
entered
the
first
public
telephone
office
i
came
to
and
rang
him
up
he
had
not
seen
lola
for
a
week
and
had
heard
nothing
from
her
relating
to
her
sudden
departure
i
went
sadly
home
to
my
in
victoria
street
feeling
that
now
at
last
the
abomination
of
desolation
had
overspread
my
life
why
had
she
gone
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
why
not
a
line
of
explanation
and
the
simultaneous
disappearance
of
quast
and
the
cats
what
did
that
betoken
had
she
been
summoned
for
any
reason
to
the
maison
de
sante
where
anastasius
papadopoulos
was
incarcerated
if
so
why
this
secrecy
why
should
lola
of
all
people
side
with
destiny
and
make
a
greater
tom
fool
of
me
than
ever
this
could
be
no
other
than
the
final
jest
i
do
not
care
to
remember
what
i
did
and
said
in
the
privacy
of
my
little
room
there
are
things
a
man
locks
away
even
from
himself
i
was
in
the
midst
of
my
misery
when
the
bell
of
my
tiny
flat
rang
i
opened
the
door
and
found
my
sister
agatha
smiling
on
the
threshold
hallo
said
i
gazing
at
her
stupidly
you
not
effusive
in
your
welcome
my
dear
simon
she
remarked
wo
you
ask
me
to
come
in
by
all
means
said
i
come
in
she
entered
and
looked
round
my
little
what
a
in
the
sky
i
had
no
idea
it
was
as
tiny
as
this
i
think
i
shall
call
you
saint
simon
i
was
in
no
mood
for
agatha
i
bowed
ironically
and
inquired
to
what
i
owed
the
honour
of
the
visit
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
a
great
favour
i
dying
to
see
the
new
dances
at
the
palace
theatre
they
say
they
dance
on
everything
except
their
feet
i
got
a
box
tom
promised
to
take
me
now
he
finds
he
ca
i
telephoned
all
over
the
place
for
something
uncompromising
in
or
out
of
trousers
to
accompany
me
and
i
ca
get
hold
of
anybody
so
i
come
to
i
vastly
flattered
said
i
she
dismissed
my
sarcasm
with
impatience
do
be
silly
if
i
had
thought
you
would
like
it
i
should
have
come
to
you
first
i
did
want
to
bore
you
but
i
did
think
you
would
pull
me
out
of
a
what
a
hole
i
asked
i
paid
for
a
box
and
i
ca
go
by
myself
how
can
i
do
take
me
there
a
i
afraid
i
too
dull
for
haunts
of
merriment
said
i
she
regarded
me
reproachfully
it
is
often
i
ask
you
to
put
yourself
out
for
me
the
last
time
was
when
i
asked
you
to
be
the
baby
godfather
and
a
pretty
godfather
you
been
i
bet
you
anything
you
do
remember
the
i
do
said
i
what
it
then
it
it
i
snapped
my
fingers
the
brat
name
had
for
the
moment
gone
out
of
my
distracted
head
she
broke
into
a
laugh
and
ran
her
arm
through
mine
yes
of
course
dorcas
i
was
going
to
say
then
you
were
going
to
say
wrong
for
it
dorothy
now
you
come
for
the
sake
of
i
do
anything
you
please
i
cried
in
desperation
so
long
as
you
not
talk
to
me
of
my
own
affairs
and
will
let
me
sit
as
glum
as
ever
i
then
for
the
first
time
she
manifested
some
interest
in
my
mood
she
put
her
head
to
one
side
and
scanned
my
face
narrowly
what
the
matter
simon
i
absorbed
too
much
life
the
last
few
days
said
i
and
now
got
i
sorry
dear
old
boy
whatever
it
is
she
said
affectionately
come
round
and
dine
at
and
i
promise
not
to
worry
what
could
i
do
i
accepted
the
alternative
to
procuring
agatha
an
evening
amusement
was
pacing
up
and
down
my
and
beating
my
wings
figuratively
and
perhaps
my
head
literally
against
the
bars
it
awfully
sweet
of
you
said
agatha
now
i
rush
home
and
i
accompanied
her
down
the
lift
to
the
front
door
and
attended
her
to
her
carriage
i
do
you
a
good
turn
some
day
dear
she
said
as
she
drove
off
i
rather
flatter
myself
that
agatha
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
my
dulness
at
dinner
in
my
converse
with
her
i
was
faced
by
various
alternatives
i
might
lay
bare
my
heart
tell
her
of
my
love
for
lola
and
my
bewildered
despair
at
her
desertion
this
i
knew
she
would
no
more
understand
than
if
i
had
proclaimed
a
mad
passion
for
a
young
lady
who
had
waited
on
me
at
a
or
for
a
cassowary
at
the
zoo
even
the
best
and
most
affectionate
of
sisters
have
their
sympathetic
limitations
i
might
have
maintained
a
mysterious
and
byronic
gloom
this
would
have
been
sheer
bad
manners
i
might
have
attributed
my
lack
of
spontaneous
gaiety
to
toothache
or
this
would
have
aroused
sisterly
and
matronly
sympathies
and
i
should
have
had
the
devil
own
job
to
escape
from
the
house
unpoisoned
by
the
nostrums
that
lurk
in
the
medicine
chest
of
every
family
agatha
i
knew
had
a
peculiarly
borgiaesque
equipment
lastly
there
was
the
worldly
device
which
i
adopted
of
dissimulating
the
furnace
of
my
affliction
beneath
a
smiling
exterior
agatha
therefore
found
me
an
entertaining
guest
and
drove
me
to
the
palace
theatre
in
high
good
humour
there
however
i
could
resign
my
role
of
entertainer
in
favour
of
the
professionals
on
the
stage
i
sat
back
in
my
corner
of
the
box
and
gave
myself
up
to
my
harassing
concerns
young
ladies
warbled
comic
acrobats
squirted
siphons
at
each
other
and
kicked
each
other
in
the
stomach
jugglers
threw
plates
and
brass
balls
with
dizzying
skill
the
famous
dancers
gyrated
pyrotechnically
the
house
applauded
with
delight
agatha
laughed
and
chuckled
and
clapped
her
hands
and
i
remained
silent
unnoticed
and
unnoticing
in
my
reflective
corner
longing
for
the
foolery
to
end
where
was
lola
why
had
she
forsaken
me
what
remedy
in
the
fiend
name
was
there
for
this
heart
torture
within
me
the
most
excruciating
agonies
of
the
little
pain
inside
were
child
play
to
this
i
bit
my
lips
so
as
not
to
groan
aloud
and
contorted
my
features
into
the
semblance
of
a
smile
during
a
momentary
interval
there
came
a
knock
at
the
box
door
i
said
come
in
the
door
opened
and
there
to
my
utter
amazement
stood
dale
kynnersley
dale
sleek
alert
smiling
attired
in
the
very
latest
nicety
of
evening
dress
affected
by
contemporary
youth
dale
such
as
i
knew
and
loved
but
six
months
ago
he
came
forward
to
agatha
who
was
little
less
astounded
than
myself
how
d
do
lady
durrell
i
in
the
stalls
with
harry
essendale
i
tried
to
catch
your
eye
but
could
so
i
thought
i
come
he
turned
to
me
with
frank
outstretched
hand
how
do
simon
i
grasped
his
hand
and
murmured
something
unintelligible
the
thing
was
so
extraordinary
so
unexpected
that
my
wits
went
wandering
dale
carried
off
the
situation
lightly
it
was
he
who
was
the
man
of
the
world
and
i
the
unresourceful
stumbler
he
looking
ripping
is
he
lady
durrell
i
met
old
oldfield
the
other
day
and
he
was
raving
about
your
case
the
thing
has
never
been
done
before
says
they
going
mad
over
your
chap
in
paris
given
him
medals
and
wreaths
and
decorations
till
he
goes
about
like
a
prize
bull
at
a
fair
by
jove
it
good
to
see
you
you
might
have
taken
an
earlier
opportunity
agatha
remarked
with
some
acidity
so
i
might
retorted
dale
blandly
but
when
a
man
a
born
ass
it
takes
him
some
time
to
cultivate
sense
i
been
wanting
to
see
you
for
a
long
time
simon
and
i
just
could
resist
it
you
want
to
kick
me
out
heaven
forbid
said
i
somewhat
brokenly
for
the
welcome
sight
of
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
aroused
emotions
which
even
now
i
do
not
care
to
analyse
it
was
generous
of
you
to
come
he
coloured
rot
said
he
in
his
breezy
way
hallo
the
going
up
what
the
next
item
oh
those
fool
dogs
i
adore
performing
dogs
said
agatha
looking
toward
the
stage
he
turned
to
me
do
you
the
last
thing
on
earth
i
desired
to
behold
at
that
moment
was
a
performing
animal
my
sensitiveness
led
me
to
suspect
a
quizzical
look
in
dale
eye
fortunately
he
did
not
wait
for
my
answer
but
went
on
in
a
boyish
attempt
to
appease
agatha
i
do
despise
them
you
know
lady
durrell
but
i
seen
them
twice
before
they
really
rather
good
there
a
football
match
at
the
end
which
is
quite
oh
the
beauties
cried
agatha
over
her
shoulder
as
the
dogs
trotted
on
the
stage
i
nodded
an
acknowledgment
of
the
remark
and
she
plunged
into
rapt
contemplation
of
the
act
dale
and
i
stood
at
the
back
of
the
box
suddenly
he
whispered
come
out
into
the
corridor
i
something
to
say
to
certainly
said
i
and
followed
him
out
of
the
box
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
at
me
with
the
defiant
and
air
of
the
young
briton
who
was
about
to
commit
a
gracious
action
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
i
could
tell
by
his
manner
i
dreaded
it
and
yet
i
loved
him
for
it
why
say
anything
my
dear
boy
i
asked
you
want
to
be
friends
with
me
again
and
god
knows
i
want
to
be
friends
again
with
you
why
talk
i
got
to
get
if
off
my
chest
said
he
in
his
so
familiar
vernacular
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
been
every
end
of
a
silly
ass
and
i
want
you
to
forgive
i
vow
i
have
never
felt
so
miserably
guilty
towards
any
human
being
as
i
did
at
that
moment
i
have
never
felt
such
a
hypocrite
it
was
a
humiliating
position
i
had
inflicted
on
him
a
most
grievous
wrong
and
here
he
was
pleading
for
forgiveness
i
could
not
pronounce
the
words
of
pardon
he
misinterpreted
my
silence
i
know
i
behaved
rottenly
to
you
since
you
been
back
but
the
first
step
always
so
difficult
you
must
bear
a
grudge
against
my
dear
boy
i
cried
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
touched
to
the
heart
by
his
simple
generosity
do
let
us
talk
of
grudges
and
forgiveness
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you
contented
contented
he
cried
i
should
just
think
i
am
i
the
happiest
ass
that
does
eat
thistles
explain
yourself
my
dear
dale
said
i
relapsing
into
my
old
manner
i
going
to
marry
maisie
i
took
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
inside
the
box
agatha
said
i
leave
those
confounded
dogs
for
a
moment
and
attend
to
serious
matters
this
young
man
has
not
come
up
to
see
either
of
us
but
to
obtain
our
congratulations
he
going
to
marry
maisie
tell
me
all
about
it
said
agatha
intensely
interested
a
load
of
responsibility
rolled
off
my
shoulders
like
christian
pack
i
looked
at
the
dog
football
match
with
the
interest
of
a
sheffield
puddler
at
a
and
clapped
my
hands
an
hour
or
so
later
after
we
had
seen
agatha
home
and
dale
had
incidentally
chucked
lord
essendale
the
phrase
is
his
own
we
were
sitting
over
whisky
and
soda
and
cigars
in
my
victoria
street
flat
the
ingenuousness
of
youth
had
insisted
on
this
prolongation
of
our
meeting
he
had
a
thousand
things
to
tell
me
they
chiefly
consisted
in
a
reiteration
of
the
statement
that
he
had
been
a
rampant
and
unimagined
silly
ass
and
that
maisie
who
knew
the
whole
lunatic
story
was
a
brick
and
a
million
times
too
good
for
him
when
he
entered
my
humble
lodging
he
looked
round
in
a
bewildered
manner
why
on
earth
are
you
living
in
this
agatha
calls
it
a
i
call
it
a
i
live
here
my
dear
boy
because
it
is
the
utmost
i
can
rot
i
been
your
private
secretary
and
know
what
your
income
i
sighed
heavily
i
shall
have
to
get
a
leaflet
printed
setting
out
the
causes
that
led
to
my
change
of
fortune
then
i
can
hand
it
to
such
of
my
friends
as
manifest
surprise
indeed
i
had
grown
so
used
to
the
story
of
my
lamentable
pursuit
of
the
eumoirous
that
i
rattled
it
off
mechanically
after
the
manner
of
the
sturdy
beggar
telling
his
mendacious
tale
of
undeserved
misfortune
to
dale
however
it
was
fresh
he
listened
to
it
when
i
had
concluded
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
by
jove
you
splendid
i
always
said
you
were
just
splendid
he
gulped
down
half
a
tumbler
of
whisky
and
soda
to
hide
his
feelings
and
you
been
doing
all
this
while
i
been
making
a
howling
fool
of
myself
look
here
simon
you
were
right
all
along
the
line
from
the
very
first
when
you
tackled
me
about
lola
do
you
remember
why
refer
to
it
i
asked
i
must
he
burst
in
quickly
i
been
longing
to
put
myself
square
with
you
by
the
way
where
is
lola
i
do
know
said
i
with
grim
truthfulness
do
know
has
she
vanished
yes
said
i
that
the
end
of
it
i
suppose
poor
lola
she
was
an
awfully
good
sort
you
know
said
dale
and
i
wo
deny
i
was
hit
that
when
i
came
such
a
cropper
but
i
realise
now
how
right
you
were
i
was
just
caught
by
the
senses
nothing
else
and
when
she
wrote
to
say
it
was
all
off
between
us
my
vanity
suffered
suffered
damnably
old
chap
i
lost
the
election
through
it
did
attend
to
business
that
brought
me
to
my
senses
then
essendale
took
me
away
yachting
and
i
had
a
quiet
time
to
think
and
after
that
i
somehow
took
to
seeing
more
of
maisie
you
know
how
things
happen
and
i
jolly
grateful
to
you
old
chap
saved
me
from
god
knows
what
complications
after
all
good
sort
as
lola
is
it
rot
for
a
man
to
go
outside
his
own
class
is
it
it
depends
upon
the
man
and
also
the
woman
said
i
beginning
to
derive
peculiar
torture
from
the
conversation
dale
shook
his
wise
head
it
never
comes
off
said
he
after
a
pause
he
laughed
aloud
do
you
remember
the
lecture
you
gave
me
my
word
you
did
talk
you
produced
a
string
of
ghastly
instances
where
the
experiment
had
failed
let
me
see
who
was
there
paget
merridew
bullen
ha
ha
no
i
well
out
of
it
old
chap
thanks
to
if
any
good
has
come
of
this
sorry
business
said
i
gravely
i
only
too
grateful
to
he
caught
the
seriousness
of
my
tone
i
did
want
to
touch
on
that
side
of
it
he
said
awkwardly
i
know
what
an
infernal
time
you
had
it
must
have
been
gehenna
i
realise
now
that
it
was
on
my
account
and
so
i
can
never
do
enough
to
show
my
he
finished
his
glass
of
whisky
and
walked
about
the
tiny
room
what
has
always
licked
me
he
said
at
length
is
why
she
never
told
me
she
was
married
it
so
curious
for
she
was
as
straight
as
they
make
them
it
devilish
odd
yes
i
assented
wearily
for
every
word
of
this
talk
was
a
new
pain
devilish
odd
i
suppose
it
a
question
of
class
or
sex
said
i
what
has
sex
to
do
with
being
straight
everything
said
i
rot
said
dale
i
sighed
i
wish
your
dialectical
vocabulary
were
not
so
he
laughed
and
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
still
the
same
old
simon
it
does
my
heart
good
to
hear
you
may
i
have
another
whisky
i
took
advantage
of
this
break
to
change
the
conversation
he
had
told
me
nothing
of
his
own
affairs
save
that
he
was
engaged
to
maisie
ellerton
heavens
cried
he
is
that
enough
an
engagement
is
an
is
it
by
jove
he
laughed
boyishly
i
manage
however
to
squeeze
in
a
bit
of
work
now
and
then
the
mater
has
always
got
plenty
on
hand
for
me
and
i
do
things
for
raggles
he
has
been
awfully
decent
the
first
time
i
met
him
or
any
of
the
chiefs
after
the
election
i
was
in
a
blue
funk
but
no
one
seemed
to
blame
me
they
all
said
they
were
sorry
and
now
raggles
is
looking
out
for
a
constituency
for
me
to
nurse
for
the
next
general
election
then
things
hum
i
promise
you
he
waved
his
cigar
with
the
air
of
a
young
paladin
about
to
conquer
the
world
in
spite
of
my
own
depression
i
could
not
help
smiling
with
gladness
at
the
sight
of
him
with
his
extravagantly
cut
waistcoat
his
elaborately
exquisite
white
tie
his
perfectly
fitting
evening
clothes
with
his
supple
ease
of
body
his
charming
manner
the
preposterous
fellow
made
as
gallant
a
show
as
any
ruffling
blade
in
powder
and
shoes
he
had
acquired
too
an
extra
touch
of
manhood
since
i
had
seen
him
last
i
felt
proud
of
him
conscious
that
to
the
making
of
him
i
had
to
some
small
degree
contributed
you
must
come
out
and
lunch
with
maisie
and
me
one
day
this
week
said
he
she
would
love
to
see
wait
till
you
married
said
i
and
then
we
consider
it
at
present
maisie
is
under
the
social
dominion
of
her
well
what
of
it
just
that
said
i
then
the
truth
dawned
on
him
he
grew
excited
and
said
it
was
damnable
he
was
going
to
stand
by
and
see
people
believe
a
lot
of
scandalous
lies
about
me
he
had
no
idea
people
had
given
me
the
cold
shoulder
he
would
jolly
well
such
were
his
words
take
a
something
i
forget
the
adjective
megaphone
and
trumpet
about
society
what
a
splendid
fellow
i
was
i
tell
everybody
the
whole
story
about
myself
from
beginning
to
end
he
declared
i
checked
him
you
very
generous
my
dear
boy
said
i
but
do
me
a
favour
by
letting
folks
believe
what
they
and
then
i
explained
as
delicately
as
i
could
how
his
sudden
championship
could
be
of
little
advantage
to
me
and
might
do
him
considerable
harm
in
his
impetuous
manner
he
cut
short
my
argument
rubbish
heaps
of
people
i
know
are
already
convinced
that
i
was
keeping
lola
brandt
and
that
you
took
her
from
me
in
the
ordinary
vulgar
way
yes
yes
i
interrupted
shrinking
that
why
i
order
you
in
name
to
leave
the
whole
thing
but
confound
it
man
i
come
out
of
it
all
right
why
should
you
even
supposing
lola
was
a
loose
woman
i
threw
up
my
hand
stop
he
looked
disconcerted
for
a
moment
we
know
she
is
but
for
the
sake
of
argument
do
argue
said
i
let
us
drop
but
hang
it
all
he
shouted
in
desperation
ca
i
do
something
ca
i
go
and
kick
somebody
i
lost
my
i
rose
and
put
both
my
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
you
can
kick
anybody
you
please
whom
you
hear
breathe
a
word
against
the
honour
and
purity
of
madame
lola
then
i
walked
away
knowing
i
had
betrayed
myself
and
tried
to
light
a
cigar
with
fingers
that
shook
there
was
a
pause
dale
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
one
foot
on
the
fender
the
cigar
took
some
lighting
the
pause
grew
irksome
my
regard
for
madame
brandt
said
i
at
last
is
such
that
i
wish
to
discuss
her
with
any
i
looked
at
dale
and
met
his
keen
eyes
fixed
on
me
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
played
about
his
mouth
very
well
said
he
dryly
we
wo
discuss
her
but
all
the
same
my
dear
simon
i
ca
help
being
interested
in
her
and
as
obviously
the
same
it
seems
rather
curious
that
you
do
know
where
she
do
you
doubt
me
i
asked
somewhat
staggered
by
his
tone
good
heaven
no
but
if
she
has
disappeared
i
convinced
that
something
has
happened
which
i
know
nothing
of
of
course
it
none
of
my
there
was
a
new
and
startling
note
of
assurance
in
his
voice
certainly
he
had
developed
during
the
past
few
months
what
i
had
done
heaven
only
knows
misfortune
which
is
supposed
to
be
formative
of
character
seemed
to
have
turned
mine
into
pie
how
can
i
otherwise
account
for
my
not
checking
the
lunatic
impulse
that
prompted
my
next
words
well
something
has
happened
said
i
and
if
we
to
be
friends
you
had
better
know
it
two
days
ago
for
the
first
time
i
told
madame
brandt
that
i
loved
her
this
very
afternoon
i
went
to
get
her
answer
to
my
question
would
she
marry
me
and
i
found
that
she
had
disappeared
without
leaving
any
address
behind
her
so
whenever
you
hear
her
name
mentioned
you
can
just
tell
everybody
that
she
the
one
woman
in
the
whole
wide
world
i
want
to
poor
old
simon
said
dale
poor
old
that
exactly
how
things
lord
who
would
have
thought
it
how
i
borne
with
you
talking
about
her
all
this
evening
the
devil
only
knows
i
cried
you
driven
me
half
you
should
have
told
me
to
shut
i
poor
old
simon
i
so
sorry
but
i
had
no
idea
you
had
fallen
in
love
with
fallen
in
love
said
i
losing
my
head
she
the
only
woman
on
earth
i
ever
cared
for
i
want
her
as
i
wanted
nothing
in
the
universe
and
you
come
to
care
for
her
as
much
as
that
he
said
sympathetically
poor
old
why
the
devil
should
i
i
shouted
nettled
by
his
poor
old
lola
brandt
is
hardly
of
your
class
said
dale
i
broke
out
furiously
damn
class
i
had
enough
of
it
i
going
to
take
my
life
into
my
own
hands
and
do
what
i
like
with
it
i
going
to
choose
my
mate
without
any
reference
to
society
i
cut
myself
adrift
from
society
it
can
go
hang
lola
brandt
is
a
woman
worth
any
loving
she
is
a
woman
in
a
million
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
last
words
were
scarcely
out
of
my
mouth
when
an
echo
from
the
distance
came
and
as
it
were
banged
at
my
ears
dale
himself
had
shrieked
them
at
me
in
exactly
the
same
tone
with
reference
to
the
same
woman
i
stopped
short
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
rather
stupidly
then
the
imp
of
humour
who
for
some
time
had
deserted
me
flew
to
my
side
and
tickled
my
brain
i
broke
into
a
chuckle
somewhat
hysterical
i
must
admit
and
then
throwing
myself
into
an
gave
way
to
uncontrollable
laughter
the
scare
of
the
unexpected
rose
in
dale
eyes
why
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
ca
you
see
i
cried
as
far
as
the
paroxysms
of
my
mirth
would
let
me
ca
you
see
how
exquisitely
ludicrous
the
whole
thing
has
been
from
beginning
to
end
do
you
realise
that
you
and
i
are
playing
the
same
scene
as
we
played
months
ago
in
my
library
with
the
only
difference
that
we
have
changed
roles
i
the
raving
infatuated
youth
and
you
the
grave
and
reverend
mentor
do
you
see
do
you
see
i
ca
see
anything
to
laugh
at
said
dale
sturdily
and
he
could
there
are
thousands
of
bright
human
beings
constituted
like
that
life
spreads
out
before
them
one
of
its
most
farces
and
they
see
in
it
nothing
to
laugh
at
to
dale
the
affair
had
been
as
serious
and
lacking
in
the
fantastic
as
the
measles
he
had
got
over
the
disease
and
now
was
exceedingly
sorry
to
perceive
that
i
had
caught
it
in
my
turn
it
is
funny
a
bit
he
continued
it
quite
natural
i
see
it
all
now
you
cut
me
out
from
the
very
first
you
did
mean
to
you
never
thought
of
it
but
what
chance
had
i
against
you
i
was
a
young
ass
and
you
were
a
brilliant
man
of
the
world
i
bear
you
no
grudge
you
played
the
game
in
that
way
then
things
happened
and
at
last
you
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
now
just
at
the
critical
moment
she
has
gone
off
into
space
it
must
be
devilish
painful
for
you
if
you
ask
oh
dale
said
i
shaking
my
head
the
only
fitting
end
to
the
farce
would
be
if
you
wandered
over
europe
to
find
and
bring
her
back
to
i
do
know
about
that
said
he
because
i
engaged
and
that
as
i
said
gives
me
occupation
but
if
i
can
do
anything
practicable
my
dear
old
simon
you
only
got
to
send
for
he
pulled
out
his
watch
my
hat
he
exclaimed
it
past
two
chapter
xxii
i
am
a
personage
apart
from
humanity
i
vary
from
the
kindly
ways
of
man
a
curse
is
on
me
surely
no
man
has
fought
harder
than
i
have
done
to
convince
himself
of
the
deadly
seriousness
of
existence
and
surely
before
the
feet
of
no
man
has
destiny
cast
such
to
faith
i
might
be
an
ancient
dweller
in
the
thebaid
struggling
towards
dreams
of
celestial
habitations
and
confronted
only
by
grotesque
visions
of
hell
no
matter
what
i
do
i
baffled
i
look
upon
sorrow
and
say
lo
this
is
tragedy
and
hey
presto
a
trick
of
lightning
turns
it
into
farce
i
cry
aloud
in
perfervid
zeal
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
the
apotheosis
of
the
fantastic
is
not
its
goal
and
immediately
a
grinning
irony
comes
to
give
the
lie
to
my
credo
or
is
it
that
by
inscrutable
decree
of
the
almighty
powers
i
am
undergoing
punishment
for
an
old
unregenerate
point
of
view
being
doomed
to
wear
my
detested
motley
for
all
eternity
to
stretch
out
my
hand
for
ever
to
grasp
realities
and
find
i
can
do
nought
but
beat
the
air
with
my
bladder
to
listen
with
strained
ear
perpetually
expectant
of
the
music
of
the
spheres
and
catch
nothing
but
the
mocking
jingle
of
the
bells
on
my
fool
cap
i
do
know
i
give
it
up
such
were
my
thoughts
on
the
morning
after
my
interview
with
dale
when
i
had
read
a
long
long
letter
from
lola
which
she
had
despatched
from
paris
the
letter
lies
before
me
now
many
pages
in
a
curious
foreign
hand
many
would
think
it
an
letter
for
there
are
faults
of
spelling
and
faults
of
grammar
but
even
now
as
i
look
on
those
faults
the
tears
come
into
my
eyes
oh
how
exquisitely
pathetically
monumentally
sublimely
foolish
she
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
it
poor
dear
it
was
only
the
again
leading
her
blindly
away
so
as
once
more
to
leave
me
high
and
dry
on
the
hill
of
derision
my
dear
you
must
forgive
me
my
heart
is
breaking
but
i
know
i
doing
right
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
out
of
your
life
for
ever
it
terrifies
me
to
think
of
it
but
it
the
only
way
i
know
you
think
you
love
me
dear
but
you
ca
you
ca
love
a
woman
so
far
beneath
you
and
i
would
sooner
never
see
you
again
than
marry
you
and
wake
up
one
day
and
find
that
you
hated
and
scorned
me
can
you
wonder
that
i
shook
my
fist
at
heaven
and
danced
with
rage
miss
eleanor
faversham
called
on
me
just
a
few
minutes
after
you
left
me
that
afternoon
we
had
a
long
long
talk
simon
dear
you
must
marry
her
you
loved
her
once
for
you
were
engaged
and
only
broke
it
off
because
you
thought
you
were
going
to
die
and
she
loves
you
simon
and
she
is
a
lady
with
all
the
refinement
and
education
that
i
could
never
have
she
is
of
your
class
dear
and
understands
you
and
can
help
you
on
whereas
i
could
only
drag
you
down
i
am
not
fit
to
black
her
boots
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
in
the
most
heartrending
strain
of
insensate
and
heroic
the
vainest
and
most
heartless
dog
of
a
man
stands
abashed
and
helpless
before
such
things
in
a
woman
she
had
not
seen
or
written
to
me
because
she
would
not
have
her
resolution
weakened
after
the
great
wrench
succeeding
things
were
easier
she
had
taken
anastasius
cats
and
proposed
to
work
them
in
the
abroad
and
send
the
proceeds
to
be
administered
for
the
little
man
comfort
at
the
maison
de
sante
as
both
her
name
and
the
papadopoulos
troupe
of
cats
were
well
known
in
the
variety
world
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
to
obtain
engagements
she
had
already
opened
negotiations
for
a
short
season
somewhere
abroad
i
was
not
to
be
anxious
about
her
she
would
have
plenty
of
occupation
i
am
not
sending
you
any
address
for
i
do
want
you
to
know
where
i
am
dear
i
sha
write
to
you
again
unless
i
scribble
things
and
tear
them
up
without
posting
this
is
final
when
a
woman
makes
such
a
break
she
must
do
it
once
and
for
all
oh
simon
when
you
kissed
me
two
days
ago
you
thought
you
loved
me
but
i
know
what
the
senses
are
and
how
they
deceive
people
and
i
had
only
just
caught
your
senses
on
that
spring
afternoon
and
i
made
you
do
it
for
i
had
been
aching
aching
for
months
for
a
word
of
love
from
you
and
when
it
came
i
was
ashamed
but
i
should
have
been
weak
and
shut
my
eyes
to
everything
if
miss
faversham
had
not
come
to
me
like
god
good
angel
at
the
fourth
reading
of
the
letter
i
stopped
short
at
these
words
god
good
angel
indeed
could
anything
have
been
more
calculated
to
put
a
man
into
a
frenzy
i
seized
my
hat
and
stick
and
went
in
search
of
the
nearest
public
telephone
office
in
less
than
ten
minutes
i
had
arranged
an
immediate
interview
with
eleanor
faversham
at
my
sister
agatha
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
was
pacing
up
and
down
agatha
waiting
for
her
god
good
angel
the
sound
of
the
words
made
me
choke
with
wrath
there
are
times
when
angelic
interference
in
human
destinies
is
entirely
unwarrantable
i
stamped
and
i
fumed
and
i
composed
a
speech
in
which
i
told
eleanor
exactly
what
i
thought
of
angels
as
i
had
to
wait
a
considerable
time
however
before
eleanor
appeared
the
raging
violence
of
my
wrath
abated
and
when
she
did
enter
the
room
smiling
and
fresh
with
the
spring
in
her
clear
eyes
and
a
flush
on
her
cheek
i
just
said
how
d
do
eleanor
in
the
most
commonplace
way
and
offered
her
a
chair
i
come
you
see
you
were
rather
peremptory
so
i
thought
it
must
be
a
matter
of
great
it
is
said
i
you
went
to
see
madame
i
did
she
replied
looking
at
me
steadily
and
i
have
tried
to
write
to
you
but
it
is
more
difficult
than
i
well
said
i
it
no
use
writing
now
for
you
managed
to
drive
her
out
of
the
she
half
rose
in
her
chair
and
regarded
me
with
eyes
i
driven
her
out
of
the
country
yes
with
her
maid
and
her
belongings
and
anastasius
troupe
of
performing
cats
and
anastasius
papadopoulos
late
pupil
and
assistant
quast
she
has
given
up
her
comfortable
home
in
london
and
now
proposes
to
be
a
wanderer
among
the
of
but
that
not
my
fault
indeed
it
she
says
in
a
letter
i
received
this
morning
bearing
no
address
that
if
you
had
come
to
her
like
god
good
angel
she
would
have
remained
in
eleanor
looked
bewildered
i
thought
i
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
made
what
clear
she
blushed
a
furious
red
ca
you
guess
you
must
be
as
stupid
as
she
is
and
of
course
you
wildly
angry
with
me
are
you
i
certainly
wish
you
had
gone
to
see
was
it
merely
to
tell
me
this
that
you
ordered
me
to
come
here
she
asked
with
a
touch
of
anger
in
her
voice
for
however
much
like
good
angels
young
women
may
be
they
generally
have
a
spirit
of
their
own
i
felt
i
had
been
wanting
in
tact
also
that
i
had
put
myself
through
an
impetuosity
foreign
to
what
i
had
thought
to
be
my
character
in
a
foolish
position
if
i
replied
affirmatively
to
her
question
she
would
have
served
me
perfectly
right
by
tossing
her
head
in
the
air
and
marching
indignantly
out
of
the
room
i
temporised
in
order
to
understand
the
extraordinary
consequences
of
your
interview
i
should
like
to
have
some
idea
of
what
took
place
i
know
my
dear
eleanor
i
continued
as
gently
as
i
could
i
know
that
you
went
to
see
her
out
of
the
very
great
kindness
of
your
heart
no
i
i
made
a
little
gesture
in
lieu
of
reply
there
was
a
span
of
silence
eleanor
played
with
the
silky
ears
of
agatha
little
yorkshire
terrier
which
had
somehow
strayed
into
the
room
and
taken
possession
of
her
lap
do
you
see
simon
she
said
at
last
half
tearfully
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
dog
do
you
see
that
by
accusing
me
in
this
way
you
make
it
almost
impossible
for
me
to
speak
and
i
was
going
to
be
so
loyal
to
a
tear
fell
down
her
cheek
on
to
the
dog
back
and
convicted
me
of
unmitigated
brutality
what
else
could
you
be
but
loyal
i
murmured
your
attitude
all
through
has
shone
she
flashed
her
hand
angrily
over
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
and
i
wanted
to
be
loyal
to
the
end
if
you
had
waited
and
she
had
waited
you
would
have
seen
as
soon
as
i
could
have
conveyed
it
to
you
decently
i
should
have
shown
you
ah
she
broke
off
put
the
yorkshire
terrier
on
the
sofa
beside
her
and
rose
with
an
impatient
gesture
you
want
to
know
why
i
called
on
lola
brandt
i
felt
i
had
to
know
for
myself
what
kind
of
woman
she
was
she
was
the
woman
between
us
you
and
me
you
do
suppose
i
ceased
to
care
for
you
just
because
what
we
thought
was
a
fatal
illness
broke
off
our
engagement
i
did
care
for
you
i
cared
for
you
in
a
way
i
say
a
way
i
tell
you
why
later
on
when
we
met
here
the
last
time
do
you
think
i
was
not
moved
i
knew
your
altered
position
would
not
allow
you
to
suggest
a
renewal
of
the
engagement
so
i
offered
you
the
opportunity
do
you
remember
but
i
could
not
tell
whether
you
still
cared
for
me
or
whether
you
cared
for
the
other
woman
so
i
had
to
go
and
see
her
i
could
bear
to
think
that
you
might
feel
in
honour
bound
to
take
me
at
my
word
and
be
caring
all
the
time
for
some
one
else
i
went
to
see
her
and
then
i
realised
that
i
count
do
ask
why
women
know
these
things
and
i
found
that
she
loved
you
with
a
warmth
and
richness
i
incapable
of
i
felt
i
had
stepped
into
something
big
and
splendid
as
if
i
had
been
a
caterpillar
walking
into
the
heart
of
a
red
rose
i
felt
prim
and
small
and
petty
until
then
i
had
never
known
what
love
meant
and
i
did
feel
it
i
could
feel
it
i
could
give
you
a
millionth
part
of
what
that
woman
does
and
i
knew
that
having
lived
in
that
atmosphere
you
could
possibly
be
content
with
me
if
you
had
waited
i
should
have
found
some
means
of
telling
you
so
that
what
i
meant
by
saying
i
was
loyal
to
you
and
i
thought
i
had
made
it
clear
to
her
it
seems
i
did
it
is
my
my
dear
said
i
when
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
this
astonishing
avowal
and
stood
looking
at
me
somewhat
defiantly
and
twisting
her
fingers
nervously
in
front
of
her
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
to
say
to
you
can
tell
me
at
least
that
my
instinct
was
which
one
a
woman
has
so
that
you
love
lola
i
lifted
my
arms
in
a
helpless
gesture
and
let
them
drop
to
my
sides
one
is
not
one
own
master
in
these
then
you
do
yes
said
i
in
a
low
voice
eleanor
drew
a
long
breath
turned
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
and
she
knows
it
i
have
told
her
then
why
in
the
world
has
she
run
away
because
you
two
wonderful
and
divinely
foolish
people
have
been
too
big
for
each
other
while
you
were
impressed
by
one
quality
in
her
she
was
equally
impressed
by
another
in
you
she
departed
burning
her
ships
so
as
to
go
entirely
out
of
my
life
for
the
simple
reason
as
she
herself
expresses
it
that
she
was
not
fit
to
black
your
boots
so
said
i
taking
her
left
hand
in
mine
and
patting
it
gently
between
you
two
dear
divine
angel
fools
i
fall
to
the
a
while
later
just
before
we
parted
she
said
in
her
frank
way
i
know
many
people
would
say
i
behaved
with
shocking
impropriety
immodestly
and
all
that
you
do
do
you
i
believe
half
the
unhappiness
in
life
comes
from
people
being
afraid
to
go
straight
at
things
perhaps
i
gone
too
straight
this
time
but
you
forgive
me
i
smiled
and
squeezed
her
hand
my
dear
said
i
lola
brandt
was
right
you
are
god
good
i
went
away
in
a
chastened
mood
no
longer
wrathful
for
what
could
woman
do
more
for
mortal
man
than
what
eleanor
faversham
had
attempted
she
had
gone
to
see
whether
she
should
stand
against
her
rival
and
with
a
superb
generosity
unprecedented
in
her
sex
she
had
withdrawn
the
magnanimity
of
it
overwhelmed
me
i
walked
along
the
street
exalting
her
to
viewless
pinnacles
of
and
then
suddenly
the
devil
whispered
in
my
ear
that
execrated
word
it
poisoned
the
rest
of
the
day
it
confirmed
my
conviction
of
the
ironical
designs
of
destiny
destiny
not
content
with
making
me
a
victim
of
the
accursed
principle
in
my
own
person
had
used
these
two
dear
women
as
its
instruments
in
dealing
me
fresh
humiliation
where
would
it
end
where
could
i
turn
to
escape
such
an
enemy
if
i
had
been
alone
in
green
fields
instead
of
sloane
square
i
should
have
clapped
my
hands
to
my
head
and
prayed
god
not
to
drive
me
crazy
i
should
have
cried
wild
vows
to
the
winds
and
shaken
my
fist
at
the
sky
and
rolled
upon
the
grass
and
made
a
genteel
idiot
of
myself
nature
would
have
understood
men
do
these
things
in
time
of
stress
and
i
was
in
great
stress
i
loved
a
woman
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
i
was
a
man
nearly
forty
i
wanted
her
with
every
quivering
nerve
in
me
and
she
was
gone
lost
in
the
vast
expanse
of
europe
with
a
parcel
of
performing
cats
gone
out
of
my
life
loving
me
as
i
loved
her
all
on
account
of
this
principle
ye
gods
if
the
fierce
pure
deep
abiding
love
of
a
man
for
a
woman
is
not
a
reality
what
in
this
world
of
shadows
is
anything
but
vapour
i
grasped
it
tight
hugged
it
to
my
bosom
and
now
she
was
gone
and
in
my
ears
rang
the
derisive
laughter
of
the
enemy
where
would
it
end
what
would
happen
next
nothing
was
too
outrageously
maniacally
impossible
i
walked
up
sloane
street
a
street
for
which
impeccable
respectability
security
of
life
and
person
comfortable
modern
prosperous
smugness
has
no
superior
in
all
the
smug
cities
of
the
earth
and
i
was
prepared
to
encounter
with
a
smile
of
recognition
anything
that
the
whirling
brains
of
bedlam
had
ever
conceived
why
should
not
this
little
lady
tripping
along
with
gold
and
anxious
shopping
knit
of
the
brow
throw
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
salute
me
as
her
brother
why
should
not
the
patient
horses
in
that
omnibus
suddenly
turn
into
griffins
and
begin
to
snort
fire
from
their
nostrils
why
should
not
that
policeman
who
on
his
beat
was
approaching
me
with
the
heavy
measured
tread
suddenly
arrest
me
for
complicity
in
the
pazzi
conspiracy
or
the
rye
house
plot
why
should
not
the
whole
of
the
decorous
street
suddenly
change
into
the
inconsequence
of
an
empire
ballet
why
should
not
the
heavens
fall
down
and
universal
chaos
envelop
all
the
only
possible
reason
i
can
think
of
now
is
that
the
almighty
powers
did
not
consider
it
worth
while
to
go
to
quite
so
much
trouble
on
my
account
this
however
gives
you
some
idea
of
my
state
of
mind
but
though
it
lasted
for
a
considerable
time
i
would
not
have
you
believe
that
i
fostered
it
unduly
indeed
i
repudiated
it
with
some
disgust
i
took
it
out
examined
it
and
finding
it
preposterous
set
to
work
to
modify
it
into
harmony
with
the
circumstances
of
my
life
even
the
most
sorely
tried
of
men
can
not
walk
abroad
shedding
his
exasperation
around
like
pestilence
if
he
does
he
is
put
into
a
lunatic
asylum
if
a
man
can
not
immediately
assuage
the
hunger
of
his
heart
he
must
meet
starvation
with
a
smiling
face
in
the
meantime
he
has
to
eat
so
as
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
his
body
to
clothe
himself
with
a
certain
discrimination
to
attend
to
polite
commerce
with
his
fellow
man
and
to
put
to
some
fair
use
the
hours
of
his
day
i
did
not
doubt
but
that
by
means
of
intelligent
inquiry
which
i
determined
to
pursue
in
every
possible
direction
i
should
sooner
or
later
obtain
news
of
lola
a
lady
with
a
troupe
of
performing
cats
could
not
for
long
remain
in
obscurity
true
i
might
have
gone
in
gallant
quest
of
her
but
i
had
had
enough
of
such
fool
adventures
i
bided
my
time
consulted
with
dale
who
took
up
the
work
of
a
private
detective
agency
with
his
usual
zeal
writing
letters
to
every
crony
who
languished
in
the
exile
of
foreign
embassies
and
corresponding
unknown
to
lady
kynnersley
with
the
agencies
of
the
international
aid
society
did
what
i
could
on
my
own
account
and
turned
my
attention
seriously
to
the
regeneration
of
the
judds
as
the
affairs
of
one
drunken
tailor
family
could
not
afford
me
complete
occupation
for
my
leisure
hours
i
began
to
find
myself
insensibly
drawn
by
campion
unreflecting
enthusiasm
into
all
kinds
of
small
duties
connected
with
barbara
building
before
i
could
realise
that
i
had
consented
i
discovered
myself
in
charge
of
an
evening
class
of
and
uncleanly
youths
who
assembled
in
one
of
the
to
listen
to
my
recollections
of
the
history
of
england
i
was
to
continue
the
course
begun
by
a
young
oxford
man
who
for
some
reason
or
other
had
migrated
from
barbara
building
to
toynbee
hall
i
never
done
any
schoolmastering
in
my
life
suppose
said
i
with
vivid
recollections
of
my
school
days
suppose
they
rag
me
they
wo
said
campion
who
had
come
to
introduce
me
to
the
class
and
they
did
not
i
found
these
five
and
twenty
youthful
members
of
the
proletariat
the
most
attentive
respectable
and
intelligent
audience
that
ever
listened
to
a
lecture
gradually
i
came
to
perceive
that
they
were
not
as
and
uncleanly
as
at
first
sight
i
had
imagined
a
great
many
of
them
took
notes
when
i
came
to
the
end
of
my
dissertation
on
henry
viii
i
went
among
them
as
i
discovered
the
custom
to
be
and
chatted
answering
questions
explaining
difficulties
and
advising
as
to
a
course
of
reading
the
atmosphere
of
trust
and
friendliness
compensated
for
the
lack
of
material
sweetness
here
were
young
men
pathetically
eager
to
learn
grateful
for
every
crumb
of
information
that
came
from
my
lips
they
reminded
me
of
nothing
more
than
the
ragged
class
of
scholars
around
a
teacher
in
a
mediaeval
university
some
had
vague
dreams
of
eventually
presenting
themselves
for
examinations
the
science
and
art
department
the
college
of
preceptors
the
matriculation
of
the
university
of
london
others
longed
for
education
for
its
own
sake
or
rather
as
a
means
of
raising
themselves
in
the
social
scale
others
bitten
by
the
crude
socialism
of
their
class
had
been
persuaded
to
learn
something
of
past
movements
of
mankind
so
as
to
obtain
some
basis
for
their
opinions
all
were
in
deadly
earnest
the
magnetic
attraction
between
teacher
and
taught
established
itself
after
one
or
two
lectures
i
looked
forward
to
the
next
with
excited
interest
other
things
campion
put
into
my
charge
i
went
on
tours
of
inspection
round
the
houses
of
his
competing
housewives
i
acted
as
his
deputy
at
the
police
court
when
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
a
good
record
at
barbara
got
into
trouble
with
the
constabulary
i
investigated
cases
for
the
charity
of
the
institution
in
quite
a
short
time
i
realised
with
a
gasp
that
i
had
become
part
of
the
machinery
of
barbara
building
and
was
remorselessly
and
helplessly
whirled
hither
and
thither
with
the
rest
of
the
force
of
the
driving
wheel
which
was
rex
campion
the
amazing
the
astounding
the
utterly
incredible
thing
about
the
whole
matter
was
that
i
not
only
liked
it
but
plunged
into
it
heart
and
soul
as
i
had
never
plunged
into
work
before
i
discovered
sympathies
that
had
hitherto
lain
undreamed
of
within
me
in
my
electioneering
days
i
had
it
is
true
foregathered
with
the
sons
of
toil
i
had
shaken
the
horny
hands
of
men
and
the
hands
of
women
i
had
flattered
them
and
cajoled
them
and
shown
myself
mighty
affable
as
a
sensible
and
aspiring
parliamentary
candidate
should
do
but
the
way
to
their
hearts
i
had
never
found
i
had
never
dreamed
of
seeking
and
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
great
gift
had
been
bestowed
on
me
and
i
examined
it
with
a
new
and
almost
tremulous
delight
also
for
the
first
time
in
all
my
life
i
had
taken
pain
to
be
the
companion
of
my
soul
all
my
efforts
to
find
lola
were
fruitless
i
became
acquainted
with
the
heartache
the
longing
for
the
unattainable
the
agony
of
spirit
the
only
anodyne
was
a
forgetfulness
of
self
the
only
compensation
a
glimmer
of
a
hope
and
the
shadow
of
a
smile
in
the
grey
and
leaden
lives
around
me
on
whit
monday
evening
i
was
walking
along
the
thames
embankment
on
my
way
home
from
waterloo
station
wet
through
tired
out
disappointed
and
looking
forward
to
the
dry
soft
raiment
the
warm
cosy
room
the
excellent
dinner
that
awaited
me
in
my
flat
i
with
several
others
had
been
helping
campion
with
his
annual
outing
of
factory
girls
and
young
hooligans
the
weather
which
had
been
perfect
on
saturday
sunday
and
when
we
had
started
a
gay
and
astonishing
army
at
seven
had
broken
before
ten
it
had
rained
dully
miserable
insistently
all
day
long
the
happy
day
in
the
new
forest
had
been
a
damp
and
dismal
fiasco
i
was
returning
home
thinking
i
might
walk
off
an
incipient
chill
as
depressed
as
no
one
but
the
baffled
philanthropist
can
be
when
i
perceived
a
tattered
and
dejected
man
sitting
on
a
bench
a
between
his
feet
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
head
in
his
hands
and
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
as
the
spectacle
of
a
man
crying
bitterly
in
a
public
thoroughfare
was
somewhat
remarkable
i
paused
and
then
in
order
to
see
whether
his
distress
was
genuine
and
also
not
to
arouse
his
suspicions
i
threw
myself
in
an
exhausted
manner
on
the
bench
beside
him
he
continued
to
sob
at
last
i
said
raising
my
voice
you
seem
to
be
pretty
miserable
what
wrong
he
turned
bleared
yet
eyes
upon
me
the
whole
blasted
show
said
he
there
nothing
right
in
it
me
i
gave
a
modified
assent
to
the
proposition
and
drew
my
over
my
eyes
being
wet
through
does
make
it
any
better
said
i
who
would
ha
thought
it
would
come
down
as
it
has
tell
me
that
it
enough
to
make
a
man
cut
his
throat
i
was
somewhat
surprised
you
not
in
such
a
great
distress
just
because
it
has
been
a
rainy
day
ai
i
just
he
exclaimed
it
been
and
gone
and
ruined
me
this
day
has
look
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
been
out
of
work
see
i
was
in
for
three
months
and
i
could
get
nothing
regular
to
do
when
i
come
out
i
a
packer
by
trade
i
did
odd
jobs
see
and
the
wife
she
earned
a
little
too
and
we
managed
to
keep
things
going
and
to
scrape
together
five
shillings
that
three
savings
against
whitsun
bank
holiday
and
as
the
weather
was
so
fine
i
laid
it
all
out
in
paper
windmills
to
sell
to
the
kids
on
and
i
started
out
this
morning
with
the
basket
full
of
them
all
so
fine
and
pretty
and
no
sooner
do
i
get
on
the
than
the
rain
comes
down
and
wipes
out
the
whole
blooming
lot
before
i
could
sell
one
look
he
drew
a
bedraggled
sheet
of
newspaper
from
the
and
displayed
a
piteous
sodden
welter
of
sticks
and
gaudy
pulp
at
the
sight
of
it
he
broke
down
again
and
sobbed
like
a
child
and
there
not
a
bite
in
the
nor
not
likely
to
be
for
days
and
i
dare
go
home
and
face
the
missus
and
the
kids
and
i
wish
i
was
i
had
already
seen
many
pitiful
tragedies
during
my
brief
experience
with
campion
but
the
peculiar
pitifulness
of
this
one
wrung
my
heart
it
taught
me
as
nothing
had
done
before
how
desperately
humble
are
the
aspirations
of
the
poor
i
thought
of
the
cosy
comfort
that
awaited
me
in
my
own
home
the
despair
that
awaited
him
in
his
i
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
you
seem
to
be
a
good
chap
said
i
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
consciousness
of
applauded
virtue
offered
no
consolation
i
drew
out
a
couple
of
and
threw
them
into
the
basket
for
the
missus
and
the
kids
said
i
he
picked
them
out
of
the
welter
and
holding
them
in
his
hand
looked
at
me
stupidly
can
you
afford
it
at
first
i
thought
this
remark
was
some
kind
of
sarcasm
but
suddenly
i
realised
that
dripping
wet
and
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
with
a
shapeless
old
green
homburg
hat
drooping
forlornly
about
my
ears
i
did
not
fulfil
his
conception
of
the
benevolent
millionaire
i
laughed
and
rose
from
the
bench
yes
quite
well
better
luck
next
i
nodded
a
and
walked
away
after
a
minute
he
came
running
after
me
said
he
i
ai
thanked
yer
gawd
knows
how
i
going
to
do
it
i
ca
but
would
you
mind
if
i
chucked
a
lot
of
the
stuff
into
the
river
and
told
the
missus
i
had
sold
it
and
just
got
back
my
money
she
proud
she
is
and
has
never
accepted
a
penny
in
charity
in
her
life
it
only
because
it
would
be
better
for
he
looked
at
me
with
such
earnest
appeal
that
i
saw
that
the
saving
of
his
wife
pride
was
a
serious
matter
of
course
said
i
and
here
a
few
to
add
to
it
so
as
to
give
colour
to
the
he
saw
that
i
understood
thank
you
kindly
sir
said
he
tell
me
said
i
do
you
love
your
wife
he
gaped
at
me
for
a
moment
obviously
the
question
had
never
been
put
to
him
either
by
himself
or
anybody
else
then
seeing
that
my
interest
was
genuine
he
spat
and
scratched
his
head
we
been
together
twenty
years
he
said
in
a
low
voice
emotion
struggling
with
and
i
nothing
agin
her
all
that
time
she
a
bloomin
wonder
i
tell
you
i
held
out
my
hand
at
any
rate
you
got
what
i
have
said
i
a
woman
who
loves
you
to
welcome
you
and
i
went
away
longing
longing
for
lola
arms
and
the
deep
love
in
her
voice
now
that
i
come
to
view
my
actions
in
some
sort
of
perspective
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
the
underlying
poignancy
of
this
trumpery
incident
a
poignancy
which
nevertheless
bit
deep
into
my
soul
that
finally
determined
the
current
of
my
life
a
short
while
afterwards
campion
who
for
some
time
past
had
found
the
organisation
of
barbara
building
had
far
outgrown
his
individual
power
of
control
came
to
me
with
a
proposal
that
i
should
undertake
the
management
of
the
institution
under
his
general
directorship
as
he
knew
of
my
financial
affairs
and
of
my
praiseworthy
but
futile
efforts
to
live
on
two
hundred
a
year
he
offered
me
another
two
hundred
by
way
of
salary
and
quarters
in
the
building
i
accepted
moved
the
salvage
of
my
belongings
from
victoria
street
to
lambeth
and
settled
down
to
the
work
for
which
a
providence
had
destined
me
from
my
cradle
when
i
told
agatha
she
nearly
fainted
chapter
xxiii
no
sooner
had
i
moved
into
barbara
building
and
was
preparing
to
begin
my
salaried
duties
than
i
received
news
which
sent
me
off
post
haste
to
berlin
and
just
as
it
was
not
i
but
anastasius
papadopoulos
who
discovered
captain
vauvenarde
so
in
this
case
it
was
dale
who
discovered
lola
he
burst
in
upon
me
one
day
flourishing
a
large
which
he
flung
down
on
the
table
before
my
eyes
do
you
recognise
that
it
was
the
familiar
professional
card
of
the
unhappy
anastasius
do
you
see
the
last
line
i
read
london
agents
conto
and
blag
maiden
lane
i
looked
up
well
i
asked
it
has
done
the
trick
said
he
triumphantly
what
fools
we
were
not
to
have
thought
of
it
before
i
was
rooting
out
a
drawer
of
papers
and
came
across
the
card
you
remember
he
handed
us
one
all
round
the
first
day
we
met
him
i
put
it
away
i
rather
a
methodical
devil
with
papers
as
you
know
when
i
found
it
i
danced
a
hornpipe
all
round
the
room
and
went
straight
off
to
conto
and
blag
i
made
certain
she
would
work
through
them
as
they
were
accustomed
to
shop
the
cats
and
i
found
i
was
right
they
knew
all
about
her
would
give
her
address
but
told
me
that
she
was
appearing
this
week
at
the
winter
garten
at
berlin
why
that
quagga
bevan
at
the
embassy
has
kept
his
eyes
open
for
me
as
he
promised
he
went
on
a
while
later
i
know
i
can
understand
eugen
pattenhausen
the
coot
who
runs
the
international
aid
society
not
doing
a
hand
turn
to
aid
anybody
but
bevan
for
heaven
sake
while
you
there
call
at
the
embassy
and
kick
you
forget
my
dear
boy
said
i
with
a
laugh
for
his
news
had
made
me
you
forget
that
i
have
entered
upon
a
life
of
and
one
of
the
luxuries
i
must
deny
myself
is
that
of
kicking
i
a
good
mind
to
go
with
you
and
do
it
myself
but
it
keep
do
you
know
it
rather
quaint
is
it
he
said
after
a
pause
as
if
struck
by
a
luminous
idea
it
rather
quaint
that
it
should
be
i
who
am
playing
the
little
tin
god
on
wheels
for
you
two
and
saying
you
my
children
i
thought
the
humour
of
the
situation
could
fail
to
strike
you
at
yes
said
he
knitting
his
brows
into
an
air
of
dark
reflection
it
is
funny
devilish
funny
i
dismissed
him
with
grateful
words
and
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
went
in
search
of
campion
whom
i
was
lucky
to
find
in
the
building
i
sorry
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
said
i
before
i
actually
taken
up
my
appointment
but
i
must
do
so
i
am
summoned
at
once
to
berlin
on
important
campion
gave
willing
consent
how
long
will
you
be
away
that
depends
said
i
with
a
smile
which
i
meant
to
be
enigmatic
but
assuredly
must
have
been
fatuous
upon
my
powers
of
i
had
bright
thoughts
of
going
to
berlin
and
back
in
a
meteoric
flash
bringing
lola
with
me
on
my
return
journey
to
marry
her
out
of
hand
as
soon
as
we
reached
london
cats
and
winter
gartens
concerned
me
but
little
and
of
trifles
like
contracts
i
took
no
account
if
you
there
any
time
said
campion
tugging
thoughtfully
at
his
black
beard
you
might
look
into
what
the
germans
are
doing
with
regard
to
female
rescue
work
you
might
pick
up
a
practical
tip
or
two
for
use
down
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
man
of
one
idea
i
gave
him
an
evasive
answer
and
rushed
away
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
my
journey
i
was
absurdly
boyishly
happy
no
doubt
as
to
my
success
crossed
my
mind
it
was
to
be
my
final
and
triumphant
adventure
unless
the
high
powers
stove
a
hole
in
the
steamer
or
sent
another
railway
train
to
collide
with
mine
the
of
my
object
seemed
impossible
i
had
but
to
go
to
be
seen
to
conquer
i
arrived
safely
in
berlin
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
drove
to
a
modest
hotel
in
the
kaiserstrasse
where
i
had
engaged
a
room
my
first
inquiry
was
for
a
letter
from
lola
to
my
disappointment
nothing
awaited
me
i
had
telegraphed
to
her
at
the
winter
garten
the
day
before
and
i
had
written
as
well
a
horrible
surmise
began
to
dance
before
me
suppose
conto
and
blag
had
given
dale
erroneous
information
i
grew
sick
and
faint
at
the
thought
what
laughter
there
would
be
in
olympus
over
my
fool
journey
in
great
agitation
i
clamoured
for
a
programme
of
the
winter
garten
entertainment
the
hotel
clerk
put
it
into
my
trembling
hands
there
was
no
mention
of
madame
lola
brandt
but
to
my
unspeakable
comfort
i
saw
the
announcement
professorin
anastasius
papadopoulos
und
ihre
wunderbaren
lola
was
working
the
cats
under
the
little
man
name
that
was
why
she
had
baffled
the
inquiries
instituted
by
dale
and
myself
and
had
not
received
my
telegram
i
scribbled
a
hasty
note
in
which
i
told
her
of
my
arrival
my
love
and
my
impatience
that
i
proposed
to
witness
the
performance
that
evening
and
to
meet
her
immediately
afterwards
at
the
this
addressed
to
the
professorin
anastasius
papadopoulos
i
despatched
by
special
messenger
to
the
winter
garten
after
a
hasty
toilet
and
a
more
hurried
meal
i
went
out
and
too
impatient
to
walk
i
hailed
a
droschky
and
drove
through
the
wide
cheery
streets
of
berlin
it
was
a
balmy
june
evening
the
pavements
were
thronged
through
the
vast
open
fronts
of
the
cafes
one
saw
agglutinated
masses
of
people
just
cleft
here
and
there
by
waiters
darting
to
and
fro
with
trays
of
beer
and
coffee
save
these
and
the
folks
in
theatres
all
berlin
was
in
the
streets
taking
the
air
a
sense
of
gaiety
pervaded
the
place
organised
and
recognised
as
though
it
were
as
much
part
of
a
berliner
duty
to
himself
the
fatherland
and
the
almighty
to
be
gay
when
the
labours
of
the
day
are
over
as
to
be
serious
during
business
hours
he
goes
through
it
with
a
grave
face
and
enjoys
himself
prodigiously
your
latin
when
he
fills
the
street
with
jest
and
laughter
obeys
the
ebullience
of
his
temperament
your
teuton
always
seems
to
be
conscientiously
obeying
a
book
of
regulations
i
soon
arrived
at
the
winter
garten
and
secured
a
stall
near
the
stage
the
vast
building
was
packed
with
a
smoking
and
perspiring
multitude
in
shape
it
was
like
a
long
tunnel
or
a
long
narrow
railway
station
an
impression
intensified
by
a
monotonous
barrel
roof
this
was
however
painted
blue
and
decorated
with
myriads
of
golden
stars
along
one
side
ran
a
gallery
where
those
who
liked
to
watch
the
performance
and
eat
a
dinner
at
the
same
time
could
do
so
in
elaborate
comfort
in
the
centre
of
the
opposite
side
was
the
stage
and
below
it
grouped
in
a
the
orchestra
beneath
the
starry
roof
hung
long
wisps
of
smoke
clouds
the
performance
had
only
just
begun
and
lola
turn
was
seventh
on
the
list
i
reflected
that
greater
deliberation
in
my
movements
would
have
suited
the
maturity
of
my
years
besides
enabling
me
to
eat
a
more
digestible
dinner
i
had
come
with
the
unreasoning
impatience
of
a
boy
fully
conscious
that
i
was
too
early
yet
desperately
anxious
not
to
be
too
late
i
laughed
at
myself
indulgently
and
patted
the
boy
in
me
on
the
head
meanwhile
i
gave
myself
up
with
mild
interest
to
the
entertainment
provided
it
was
the
same
as
that
at
any
winter
garden
or
variety
theatre
the
world
over
the
same
brawny
gentlemen
in
tights
made
human
pyramids
out
of
themselves
and
played
football
with
the
little
boys
and
minced
with
their
aggravating
steps
down
to
the
footlights
the
same
clown
tried
to
emulate
his
dashing
companion
on
the
horizontal
bars
pulling
himself
up
to
the
eternal
delight
of
the
audience
by
the
seat
of
his
baggy
breeches
and
hanging
his
hat
on
the
smooth
steel
upright
the
same
massive
lady
with
the
deep
chest
sang
sentimental
ballads
the
same
produced
warrens
of
rabbits
and
flocks
of
pigeons
from
impossible
receptacles
the
same
scantily
clad
damsels
sang
the
same
inane
chorus
in
the
same
flat
baby
voices
and
danced
the
same
old
dance
mankind
in
the
bulk
is
very
young
it
is
very
easily
amused
and
like
a
child
clamours
for
the
tale
the
curtain
went
down
on
the
last
turn
before
lola
i
felt
a
curious
suspense
and
half
wished
that
i
had
not
come
to
see
the
performance
i
shrank
from
finding
her
a
million
miles
away
from
me
a
new
remote
creature
impersonal
as
those
who
had
already
appeared
on
the
stage
mingled
with
this
was
a
fear
lest
she
might
not
please
this
vast
audience
failure
i
felt
would
be
as
humiliating
to
me
as
to
her
agatha
i
remembered
confessed
to
the
same
feeling
with
regard
to
myself
when
i
made
my
first
speech
in
the
house
of
commons
but
then
i
had
an
incontrovertible
array
of
facts
and
arguments
drawn
up
by
an
infallible
secretary
and
welded
into
cunning
verbiage
by
myself
which
i
learned
off
by
heart
and
the
house
as
i
knew
it
would
had
been
half
asleep
i
could
fail
but
lola
had
to
please
three
thousand
berlin
citizens
who
had
paid
their
money
for
entertainment
with
no
other
equipment
than
her
own
personality
and
the
tricks
of
a
set
of
wretched
irresponsible
cats
the
orchestra
struck
up
the
act
music
the
curtains
parted
and
revealed
the
brightly
polished
miniature
gymnasium
i
had
seen
at
cattery
the
row
of
pussies
at
the
back
each
on
a
velvet
stand
some
white
some
tabby
some
some
all
sitting
with
their
forepaws
doubled
demurely
under
their
chests
wagging
their
tails
comically
and
blinking
with
feline
indifference
at
the
footlights
a
cage
in
a
corner
in
which
i
descried
the
ferocious
wild
tomcat
and
busily
putting
the
last
touches
to
the
guy
ropes
the
pupil
and
assistant
quast
neatly
attired
in
a
close
fitting
uniform
with
brass
buttons
almost
immediately
lola
appeared
in
a
shimmering
gold
evening
gown
and
with
a
necklet
of
barbaric
gold
round
her
neck
i
had
never
seen
her
so
magnificently
so
commandingly
beautiful
i
was
conscious
of
a
ripple
of
admiration
running
through
the
huge
assembly
and
it
was
a
queer
sensation
half
pride
half
angry
jealousy
my
immediate
neighbors
were
emphatic
in
their
praise
applause
greeted
her
she
smiled
acknowledgments
and
flicking
the
little
toy
whip
which
she
carried
in
her
hand
she
began
the
act
first
of
all
the
cats
jumped
from
their
stands
like
a
military
line
and
walked
in
procession
round
the
stage
at
a
halt
and
a
signal
each
pussy
put
its
front
paws
on
its
front
neighbour
and
the
march
began
again
then
lola
did
something
with
voice
and
whip
and
each
cat
dropped
on
its
paws
and
as
if
by
magic
there
appeared
a
space
between
every
animal
at
a
further
word
the
last
cat
jumped
over
the
one
in
front
and
over
the
one
in
front
of
that
and
so
on
until
having
cleared
the
first
cat
it
leaped
on
to
its
stand
where
it
began
to
lick
itself
placidly
meanwhile
the
penultimate
cat
had
begun
the
same
evolution
and
then
the
cat
until
all
the
cats
had
cleared
the
front
one
and
had
taken
their
positions
on
their
stands
the
last
cat
left
alone
looked
round
yawned
in
the
face
of
the
audience
and
turning
tail
regained
its
stand
with
the
air
of
unutterable
boredom
the
audience
delighted
applauded
vehemently
i
raised
my
hands
as
i
clapped
them
trying
vainly
and
foolishly
to
catch
lola
eye
at
a
tap
of
her
whip
a
white
angora
and
a
sleek
tabby
jumped
from
the
stands
and
took
up
their
positions
one
at
each
end
of
a
miniature
lola
stuck
a
tiny
japanese
umbrella
in
the
collar
of
each
and
sent
them
forth
on
their
perilous
journey
when
they
met
in
the
middle
they
spat
and
caterwauled
and
argued
spitefully
the
audience
shrieked
then
by
a
miracle
the
cats
cleared
each
other
and
pursued
their
sedate
and
cautious
ways
to
their
respective
ends
of
the
rope
the
next
act
was
a
team
of
a
dozen
rats
drawing
a
tiled
chariot
driven
by
a
stolid
cat
with
green
expressionless
eyes
down
an
aisle
formed
by
the
other
cats
who
sat
in
solemn
contemplation
on
their
tails
there
was
no
doubt
of
lola
success
the
tricks
were
as
marvellous
in
themselves
as
their
execution
was
flawless
during
the
applause
i
noticed
her
eagerly
scanning
the
sea
of
faces
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
turned
in
my
direction
i
waved
my
handkerchief
and
instinct
told
me
that
at
last
she
recognised
the
point
of
pink
and
the
flutter
of
white
as
me
then
the
stage
was
cleared
of
the
gentle
cats
and
the
wire
cage
containing
hephaestus
was
pushed
forward
by
quast
he
showed
off
the
ferocious
beast
quality
by
making
it
dash
itself
against
the
wires
arch
its
huge
back
and
shoot
out
venomous
claws
lola
commanded
him
by
sign
to
open
the
cage
he
approached
in
simulated
terror
hephaestus
uttering
howls
and
every
time
he
touched
the
handle
of
the
door
hephaestus
sprang
at
him
like
a
tiger
with
the
hateful
hiss
at
last
amid
the
laughter
of
the
audience
for
this
was
prearranged
business
quast
suddenly
refused
to
obey
his
mistress
any
more
and
went
and
sat
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
of
the
stage
then
lola
with
a
glance
of
contempt
at
him
for
his
poltroonery
and
a
glance
of
confidence
at
the
audience
opened
the
cage
door
and
dragged
the
gigantic
and
malevolent
brute
out
by
the
scruff
of
its
neck
and
held
it
up
like
a
rabbit
as
she
had
done
in
anastasius
cattery
suddenly
her
iron
grip
seemed
to
relax
she
made
one
or
two
ineffectual
efforts
to
retain
it
and
the
brute
dropped
to
the
ground
she
looked
at
it
for
a
second
disconcerted
as
if
she
had
lost
her
nerve
and
then
in
a
horrible
flash
the
beast
sprang
at
her
face
she
uttered
piercing
screams
the
blood
spurted
from
the
ghastly
claws
quick
as
lightning
quast
leapt
forward
and
dragged
it
off
lola
clapped
both
hands
to
her
eyes
and
reeled
and
tottered
to
the
wings
where
i
saw
a
man
two
arms
receive
her
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
quast
kneeling
on
the
beast
on
the
floor
mastering
him
by
some
professional
clutch
then
there
rang
out
a
sharp
whistle
and
the
curtain
went
down
with
a
run
i
rose
sick
with
horror
barely
conscious
of
the
gasping
excitement
that
prevailed
around
me
and
blindly
groped
my
path
through
the
crowded
rows
of
folk
towards
the
door
i
had
only
proceeded
when
a
sudden
silence
made
me
turn
and
i
saw
a
man
addressing
the
audience
from
the
stage
apparently
it
was
the
manager
he
regretted
to
have
to
inform
the
audience
that
madame
papadopoulos
would
not
be
able
to
conclude
her
most
interesting
performance
that
evening
as
she
had
unfortunately
received
injuries
of
a
very
grave
nature
then
he
signalled
to
the
orchestra
who
crashed
into
a
loud
and
vulgar
march
with
clanging
brass
and
thundering
drum
it
sounded
so
cynically
and
hideously
inhuman
that
i
trampled
recklessly
over
people
in
my
mad
rush
to
the
exit
i
found
the
where
a
knot
of
the
performers
were
assembled
talking
of
the
horrible
accident
i
pushed
my
way
shiveringly
through
them
and
tried
to
rush
into
the
building
but
was
checked
by
a
burly
porter
i
explained
incoherently
in
my
rusty
german
i
came
for
news
of
madame
papadopoulos
i
was
her
i
declared
with
a
gush
of
inspiration
whether
he
believed
that
i
was
her
affianced
i
know
not
but
he
bade
me
wait
and
disappeared
with
my
card
i
became
at
once
the
object
of
the
curiosity
of
the
loungers
i
heard
them
whispering
together
as
they
pointed
me
out
and
pitying
me
the
cat
had
torn
her
face
away
said
one
woman
i
put
my
hands
over
my
ears
so
as
not
to
hear
presently
the
porter
returned
with
a
stout
person
in
authority
who
drew
me
into
the
box
you
are
a
friend
of
frau
papadopoulos
friend
i
cried
she
is
to
be
my
wife
i
am
in
a
state
of
horror
and
despair
tell
me
what
has
seeing
my
condition
he
laid
aside
his
official
manner
and
became
human
it
was
a
dreadful
accident
said
he
the
beast
had
apparently
got
its
claws
in
near
her
eyes
but
what
were
her
exact
injuries
he
could
not
tell
as
her
face
was
all
over
blood
and
she
had
fainted
with
the
pain
the
doctor
was
with
her
he
had
telephoned
for
an
ambulance
i
was
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
would
receive
every
possible
attention
he
would
give
my
card
to
the
doctor
meanwhile
i
was
quite
at
liberty
to
remain
in
the
box
till
the
ambulance
came
i
thanked
him
in
the
meantime
said
i
if
you
can
let
me
have
a
word
with
fraulein
dawkins
her
maid
should
she
be
in
the
theatre
or
quast
her
attendant
i
should
be
he
promised
and
withdrew
the
doorkeeper
gave
me
a
wooden
chair
and
there
i
sat
for
an
unconscionable
time
faint
and
dizzy
with
suspense
the
chance
words
i
had
heard
in
the
crowd
the
manager
remark
about
the
claws
the
memory
of
the
savage
spring
at
the
beloved
face
made
me
feel
sick
every
now
and
then
as
some
doors
leading
to
the
stage
swung
open
i
could
hear
the
orchestra
and
the
laughter
and
applause
of
the
audience
both
dawkins
and
quast
visited
me
the
former
was
in
a
helpless
state
of
tears
and
as
she
knew
no
word
of
german
she
could
understand
nothing
that
the
doctors
or
others
said
madame
was
unconscious
her
head
was
tightly
bandaged
that
was
all
the
definite
information
she
had
did
madame
know
i
was
in
front
i
asked
oh
yes
sir
i
think
she
had
a
letter
from
you
she
was
so
pleased
poor
dear
madame
she
told
me
that
you
would
see
the
best
performance
she
had
ever
whereupon
she
broke
down
and
was
useless
for
further
examination
then
quast
came
he
could
not
understand
how
the
accident
had
occurred
hephaestus
had
never
before
tried
to
attack
her
she
had
absolute
mastery
over
him
and
he
usually
behaved
with
her
as
gently
as
any
of
the
other
cats
with
himself
it
was
quite
different
he
was
accustomed
to
hephaestus
springing
at
him
but
then
he
beat
him
hard
with
a
great
stick
until
he
was
so
sore
that
he
could
neither
stand
up
nor
lie
down
i
have
always
implored
madame
to
carry
something
heavier
than
that
silly
little
whip
and
now
it
all
over
she
will
never
be
able
to
control
him
again
hephaestus
will
have
to
be
killed
and
i
will
be
desolate
ach
what
a
misfortune
he
began
to
weep
good
god
i
cried
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
sorry
for
the
brute
one
ca
help
being
fond
of
him
we
have
been
for
five
years
inseparable
companions
i
had
no
sympathy
to
fling
away
on
him
at
that
moment
how
do
you
account
for
his
spring
at
madame
that
all
i
want
to
she
must
have
been
thinking
of
something
else
when
she
grabbed
him
for
she
missed
her
grip
then
he
fell
and
was
frightened
and
she
must
have
lost
her
nerve
hephaestus
knew
it
and
sprang
that
is
always
the
case
when
wild
animals
turn
all
accidents
happen
like
his
words
filled
me
with
a
new
and
sickening
dread
she
must
have
been
thinking
of
something
of
what
else
but
of
my
presence
there
that
stupid
selfish
wave
of
the
handkerchief
i
sat
gnawing
my
hands
and
cursing
myself
the
ambulance
arrived
men
hurried
past
my
box
i
waited
again
in
agony
of
mind
at
last
the
porter
came
and
cleared
the
passage
and
doorway
of
loungers
and
i
heard
the
tread
of
footsteps
and
gruff
directions
the
manager
and
a
man
in
a
and
black
tie
whom
i
recognised
as
the
doctor
came
down
the
passage
followed
by
two
great
men
carrying
between
them
a
stretcher
covered
by
a
sheet
on
which
lay
all
that
i
loved
in
life
dawkins
followed
weeping
and
then
came
several
theatre
folk
i
went
outside
and
saw
the
stretcher
put
into
the
and
then
i
made
myself
known
to
the
doctor
she
has
received
very
great
injuries
chiefly
the
right
cheek
and
eye
so
much
so
that
she
needs
an
oculist
care
at
once
i
have
telephoned
to
steinholz
of
no
thiergarten
one
of
our
ablest
oculists
to
receive
her
now
into
his
clinique
if
you
care
to
do
so
you
are
welcome
to
accompany
i
drove
through
the
gay
flaring
streets
of
berlin
like
a
man
in
a
phantasmagoria
of
horror
chapter
xxiv
the
first
time
they
allowed
me
to
see
her
was
after
many
days
of
anxiety
i
had
indeed
called
at
the
clinique
two
or
three
times
a
day
for
news
and
i
had
written
short
letters
of
comfort
and
received
messages
taken
down
from
lola
dictation
by
a
nurse
with
an
imperfect
knowledge
of
english
these
kept
the
heart
in
me
for
the
doctor
reports
were
invariably
grave
possible
loss
of
sight
in
the
injured
eye
and
permanent
disfigurement
their
most
hopeful
prognostications
i
lived
too
in
a
nervous
agony
of
remorse
for
whatever
happened
i
held
myself
responsible
at
first
they
thought
her
life
was
in
danger
i
passed
nightmare
days
then
the
alarming
symptoms
subsided
and
it
was
a
question
of
the
saving
of
the
eye
and
the
decent
healing
of
the
cheek
torn
deep
by
the
claws
of
the
accursed
brute
when
quast
informed
me
of
its
summary
execution
i
felt
the
primitive
savage
arise
in
me
and
i
upbraided
quast
for
not
having
invited
me
to
gloat
over
its
expiring
throes
how
the
days
passed
i
know
not
i
wandered
about
the
streets
looking
into
the
windows
of
the
great
shops
buying
flowers
and
fruit
for
lola
in
eccentric
quantities
or
sitting
in
beerhouses
reading
the
financial
pages
of
a
german
paper
held
upside
down
i
could
not
return
to
london
still
less
could
i
investigate
the
german
philanthropic
methods
of
rescuing
fallen
women
i
wrote
to
campion
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
and
besought
him
to
set
a
deputy
to
work
on
the
regeneration
of
the
judds
at
last
they
brought
me
to
where
lola
lay
in
a
darkened
room
with
her
head
tightly
bandaged
a
dark
mass
spread
over
the
pillow
which
i
knew
was
her
glorious
hair
i
could
scarcely
see
the
unbandaged
half
of
her
face
she
still
suffered
acute
pain
and
i
was
warned
that
my
visit
could
only
be
of
brief
duration
and
that
nothing
but
the
simplest
matters
could
be
discussed
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
left
side
of
the
bed
her
wonderful
nervous
hand
clung
round
mine
as
we
talked
the
first
thing
she
said
to
me
in
a
weak
voice
like
the
faint
echo
of
her
deep
tones
was
i
going
to
lose
all
my
good
looks
simon
and
you
wo
care
to
look
at
me
any
she
said
it
so
simply
so
tenderly
without
a
hint
of
reproach
in
it
that
i
almost
shouted
out
my
horrible
remorse
but
i
remembered
my
injunctions
and
refrained
i
strove
to
comfort
her
telling
her
mythical
tales
of
surgical
reassurances
she
shook
her
head
sadly
it
was
like
you
to
stay
in
berlin
simon
she
said
after
a
while
although
they
would
let
me
see
you
yet
i
knew
you
were
within
call
you
ca
conceive
what
a
comfort
it
has
how
could
i
leave
you
dear
said
i
with
the
thought
of
you
throbbing
in
my
head
night
and
day
how
did
you
find
me
through
conto
and
blag
i
tried
all
other
means
you
may
be
sure
but
now
i
found
you
i
sha
let
you
go
this
was
not
the
time
for
elaborate
explanations
she
asked
for
none
when
one
is
very
ill
one
takes
the
most
unlikely
happenings
as
commonplace
occurrences
it
seemed
enough
to
her
that
i
was
by
her
side
we
talked
of
her
nurses
who
were
kind
of
the
skill
of
steinholz
who
brought
into
his
clinique
the
rigid
discipline
of
a
he
would
even
let
me
have
your
flowers
she
said
and
even
if
he
had
i
should
have
been
able
to
see
them
in
this
dark
she
questioned
me
as
to
my
doings
i
told
her
of
my
move
to
building
and
i
keeping
you
from
all
that
splendid
work
she
said
weakly
you
must
go
back
at
once
simon
i
shall
get
along
nicely
now
and
i
shall
be
happy
now
that
i
seen
you
i
kissed
her
fingers
you
have
to
learn
a
lesson
my
dear
which
will
do
you
an
enormous
amount
of
what
is
that
the
glorious
duty
of
then
the
minute
hand
of
the
clock
marked
the
end
of
the
interview
and
the
nurse
appeared
on
the
click
and
turned
me
out
after
that
i
saw
her
daily
gradually
our
interviews
lengthened
and
as
she
recovered
strength
our
talks
wandered
from
the
little
incidents
and
interests
of
the
to
the
general
topics
of
our
lives
i
told
her
of
all
that
had
happened
to
me
since
her
flight
and
i
told
her
that
i
wanted
her
and
her
only
of
all
women
why
oh
why
did
you
do
such
a
foolish
thing
i
asked
i
did
it
for
your
my
dear
have
you
ever
heard
the
story
of
the
elephant
no
it
was
told
in
a
wonderful
book
published
years
ago
and
called
fables
of
george
washington
aesop
this
is
it
there
was
once
an
elephant
who
accidentally
trod
on
the
mother
of
a
brood
of
chickens
her
tender
heart
filled
with
remorse
for
what
she
had
done
and
overflowing
with
pity
for
the
fluffy
orphans
she
wept
bitterly
and
addressed
them
thus
little
motherless
things
doomed
to
face
the
rough
world
without
a
parent
care
i
myself
will
be
a
mother
to
you
whereupon
gathering
them
under
her
with
maternal
fondness
she
sat
down
on
the
whole
the
unbandaged
half
of
her
face
lit
up
with
a
wan
smile
did
i
do
that
i
did
conceive
it
possible
that
you
could
love
me
except
for
the
outside
you
might
have
waited
and
seen
said
i
in
mild
reproof
she
sighed
you
never
understand
do
you
remember
my
saying
once
that
you
reminded
me
of
an
english
duke
you
made
fun
of
me
but
you
must
have
known
what
i
meant
you
see
simon
you
did
seem
to
care
a
hang
for
me
in
that
way
until
quite
lately
you
were
goodness
and
kindness
itself
and
i
felt
that
you
would
stick
by
me
as
a
friend
through
thick
and
thin
but
i
had
given
up
hoping
for
anything
else
and
i
knew
there
was
some
one
only
waiting
for
you
a
real
refined
lady
so
when
you
kissed
me
i
did
dare
believe
it
and
i
had
made
you
kiss
me
i
told
you
so
and
i
was
as
ashamed
as
if
i
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
loose
woman
and
when
miss
faversham
came
i
knew
it
would
be
best
for
you
to
marry
her
for
all
the
flattering
things
she
said
to
me
i
knew
my
dear
i
interrupted
you
did
know
at
all
i
loved
you
ever
since
i
saw
you
first
lying
like
a
wonderful
panther
in
your
chair
at
cadogan
gardens
you
wove
yourself
into
all
my
thoughts
and
around
all
my
actions
one
of
these
days
i
show
you
a
kind
of
diary
i
used
to
keep
and
you
see
how
i
abused
you
behind
your
her
face
or
the
dear
half
of
it
that
was
visible
fell
oh
why
for
making
me
turn
aside
from
the
nice
little
smooth
path
to
the
grave
which
i
had
marked
out
for
myself
i
regarded
myself
as
a
genteel
and
did
want
to
be
and
i
disturbed
you
until
i
danced
with
fury
and
called
down
on
your
dear
head
maledictions
which
for
fulness
and
snap
would
have
made
a
mediaeval
pope
squirm
with
she
pressed
my
hand
you
are
making
fun
again
i
thought
you
were
i
am
i
telling
you
exactly
what
happened
then
when
i
was
rapidly
approaching
the
other
world
it
did
matter
at
last
i
died
and
came
to
life
again
but
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
really
to
life
i
was
like
a
tree
in
spring
which
has
one
bud
which
obstinately
refuses
to
burst
into
blossom
at
last
it
did
burst
and
all
the
love
that
had
been
working
in
my
heart
came
to
my
lips
and
incidentally
my
dear
to
this
was
at
the
early
stages
of
her
recovery
when
one
could
only
speak
of
gentle
things
she
told
me
of
her
simple
odyssey
a
period
of
waiting
in
paris
an
engagement
at
vienna
and
budapest
and
then
berlin
her
agents
had
booked
a
week
in
dresden
and
a
fortnight
in
homburg
and
she
would
have
to
pay
the
forfeit
for
breach
of
contract
i
sorry
for
anastasius
sake
she
said
the
poor
little
mite
wrote
me
rapturous
letters
when
he
heard
i
was
out
with
the
cats
he
gave
me
a
long
special
message
for
each
which
i
was
to
whisper
in
its
poor
little
anastasius
papadopoulos
she
showed
me
his
letters
written
in
a
great
round
flourishing
sanguine
hand
he
seemed
to
be
happy
enough
at
the
maison
de
sante
he
had
formed
he
said
a
school
for
the
cats
of
the
establishment
for
which
the
authorities
were
very
grateful
and
he
heralded
the
completion
of
his
gigantic
combinations
with
regard
to
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
of
the
horse
sultan
lola
and
i
never
spoke
of
him
without
pain
for
in
spite
of
his
crazy
and
bombastic
oddities
he
had
qualities
that
were
lovable
and
now
said
lola
i
must
tell
him
that
hephaestus
has
been
killed
and
the
rest
are
again
idling
under
the
care
of
the
faithful
quast
it
seemed
a
pity
to
kill
the
poor
i
wish
to
heaven
said
i
that
he
had
been
strangled
at
you
never
liked
she
smiled
wanly
but
he
is
scarcely
to
be
blamed
i
grew
unaccountably
nervous
and
lost
control
all
savage
animals
are
like
and
seeing
that
i
was
about
to
protest
vehemently
she
smiled
again
remember
i
a
daughter
and
brought
up
from
childhood
to
regard
these
things
as
part
of
the
show
there
must
always
come
a
second
failure
of
concentration
lots
of
tamers
meet
their
deaths
sooner
or
later
for
the
same
reason
just
a
sudden
loss
of
magnetism
the
beast
gets
frightened
and
exactly
what
quast
had
told
me
exactly
what
i
myself
had
divined
at
the
sickening
moment
i
bowed
my
head
and
laid
the
back
of
her
cool
hand
against
it
and
groaned
out
my
remorse
if
i
had
not
been
there
if
i
had
not
distracted
her
attention
she
would
not
listen
to
my
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
she
had
simply
missed
her
grip
and
lost
her
head
she
forbade
me
to
mention
the
subject
again
the
misery
of
thinking
that
i
held
myself
to
blame
was
unbearable
i
said
no
more
realising
the
acute
distress
of
her
generous
soul
but
in
my
heart
i
made
a
deep
vow
of
reparation
it
was
however
with
no
such
chivalrous
feelings
but
out
of
the
simple
longing
to
fulfil
my
life
that
i
asked
her
definitely
for
the
first
time
to
marry
me
as
soon
as
she
could
get
about
the
world
again
i
put
before
her
with
what
delicacy
i
could
that
if
she
had
foolish
ideas
of
my
being
above
her
in
station
she
was
above
me
in
worldly
fortune
and
thus
we
both
had
to
make
some
sacrifices
to
our
pride
i
said
that
my
work
was
found
that
our
lives
could
be
regulated
as
she
wished
she
listened
without
saying
a
word
until
i
had
finished
then
she
took
my
hand
i
grateful
she
said
and
i
proud
and
i
know
that
i
love
you
beyond
all
things
on
earth
but
i
wo
give
you
an
answer
till
i
up
and
about
on
my
feet
why
i
insisted
do
ask
and
do
mention
the
matter
again
you
must
be
good
to
me
because
i
ill
and
do
what
i
she
smiled
and
fondled
my
hand
and
cajoled
a
reluctant
promise
from
me
then
came
days
in
which
for
no
obvious
reason
lola
received
me
with
anxious
frightened
diffidence
and
spoke
with
constraint
the
cheerfulness
which
she
had
hitherto
exhibited
gave
place
to
dull
depression
she
urged
me
continually
to
leave
berlin
where
as
she
said
i
was
wasting
my
time
and
return
to
my
work
in
london
i
shall
be
all
right
simon
perfectly
all
right
and
as
soon
as
i
can
travel
i
come
straight
to
i
not
going
to
let
you
slip
through
my
fingers
again
i
would
say
laughingly
but
i
promise
you
i
swear
to
you
i
come
back
only
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
idling
around
a
woman
when
you
have
such
glorious
things
to
do
at
home
that
a
man
work
simon
this
but
it
is
a
man
work
i
would
declare
to
devote
himself
to
the
woman
he
loves
and
not
to
leave
her
helpless
a
stranger
in
a
strange
i
wish
you
would
go
simon
i
do
wish
you
would
go
she
would
say
wearily
it
the
only
favour
i
ever
asked
you
in
my
i
looked
within
myself
to
find
the
reason
for
these
earnest
requests
in
casting
off
my
jester
suit
had
i
also
divested
myself
of
the
power
to
be
a
decently
interesting
companion
had
i
become
merely
a
dull
tactless
egotistical
bore
was
i
in
simple
naked
horrid
fact
getting
on
an
invalid
delicate
nerves
i
was
scared
of
the
new
picture
of
myself
thus
presented
i
became
and
made
particular
efforts
to
bring
a
little
gaiety
into
our
talk
but
though
she
smiled
with
her
lips
the
cloud
whatever
it
was
hung
heavily
on
her
mind
and
at
the
first
opportunity
she
came
back
to
the
ceaseless
argument
in
despair
i
took
her
nurse
into
my
confidence
she
is
right
said
the
nurse
you
are
doing
her
more
harm
than
good
you
had
better
go
away
and
write
to
her
daily
from
but
why
but
why
i
clamoured
ca
you
give
me
any
reason
the
nurse
glanced
at
me
with
a
touch
of
feminine
scorn
the
bandages
will
soon
be
well
said
i
the
sight
of
one
eye
may
be
i
know
said
i
she
is
reconciled
to
it
she
has
the
courage
and
resignation
of
a
she
has
also
the
very
common
and
natural
fears
of
a
for
heaven
sake
i
cried
tell
me
plainly
what
you
we
do
quite
know
what
disfigurement
will
result
said
the
nurse
bluntly
it
is
certain
to
be
very
great
and
the
dread
of
your
seeing
her
is
making
her
ill
and
retarding
her
recovery
so
if
you
have
any
regard
for
her
pack
up
your
things
and
go
but
i
remonstrated
i
bound
to
see
her
sooner
or
the
nurse
lost
patience
ach
ca
you
get
it
into
your
head
that
it
is
essential
it
should
be
later
when
she
is
strong
enough
to
stand
the
strain
and
has
realised
the
worst
and
made
her
little
preparations
i
accepted
the
rebuke
meekly
the
situation
when
explained
was
comprehensible
to
the
meanest
masculine
intelligence
i
will
go
said
i
when
i
announced
this
determination
to
lola
she
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
i
shall
be
so
much
happier
she
said
then
she
raised
both
her
arms
and
drew
my
head
down
until
our
lips
met
dear
she
whispered
still
holding
me
if
i
had
run
away
from
you
before
i
should
run
away
now
but
it
would
be
silly
to
do
it
twice
so
i
come
to
london
as
soon
as
the
doctor
will
let
me
but
if
you
find
you
do
and
ca
possibly
love
me
i
sha
feel
hurt
with
you
had
some
months
i
know
of
your
love
and
that
will
last
me
all
my
life
and
i
know
that
whatever
happens
you
be
my
very
dear
and
devoted
i
shall
be
your
lover
always
i
swore
she
shook
her
head
and
released
me
a
great
pity
welled
up
in
my
heart
for
i
know
now
why
she
had
forbidden
me
to
speak
of
marriage
and
in
some
dim
way
i
got
to
the
depth
of
her
woman
nature
i
realised
as
far
as
a
man
can
how
the
sudden
blasting
of
a
woman
beauty
must
revolutionise
not
only
her
own
attitude
towards
the
world
but
her
conception
of
the
world
attitude
towards
her
only
a
few
weeks
before
she
had
gone
about
proudly
conscious
of
her
superb
magnificence
it
was
the
triumphant
weapon
in
her
woman
armoury
to
use
when
she
so
chose
it
had
illuminated
a
man
journey
i
knew
and
felt
it
now
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
it
had
held
his
senses
captive
it
had
brought
him
to
her
feet
it
was
a
charm
that
she
could
always
offer
to
his
eyes
it
was
her
glory
and
her
pride
to
enhance
it
for
his
delectation
her
beauty
was
herself
that
gone
she
had
nothing
but
a
worthless
soul
to
offer
and
what
woman
would
dream
of
offering
a
man
her
soul
if
she
had
no
casket
in
which
to
enshrine
it
if
i
had
presented
this
other
aspect
of
the
case
to
lola
she
would
have
cried
out
with
perfect
sincerity
my
soul
you
get
things
like
mine
anywhere
for
twopence
a
it
was
the
blasting
of
her
beauty
that
was
the
infinite
matter
all
that
i
loved
would
be
gone
she
would
have
nothing
left
to
give
the
splendour
of
the
day
had
ceased
and
now
was
coming
the
long
long
dreary
night
to
meet
which
with
dignity
she
was
nerving
her
brave
heart
the
tears
were
not
far
from
my
eyes
when
i
said
again
softly
your
lover
always
make
no
promises
she
said
except
and
that
is
that
you
will
write
me
often
until
i
come
every
so
we
parted
and
i
returned
to
london
and
to
my
duties
at
building
i
wrote
daily
and
her
dictated
answers
gave
me
knowledge
of
her
progress
to
my
immense
relief
i
heard
that
the
oculist
skill
had
saved
her
eyesight
but
it
could
not
obliterate
the
traces
of
the
cruel
claws
the
days
although
fuller
with
work
and
interests
appeared
long
until
she
came
i
saw
but
little
of
the
outside
world
dale
my
sister
agatha
sir
joshua
oldfield
and
campion
were
the
only
friends
i
met
dale
was
ingenuously
sympathetic
when
he
head
of
the
calamity
what
going
to
happen
he
asked
after
he
had
exhausted
his
vocabulary
of
abuse
on
cats
providence
and
anastasius
papadopoulos
what
the
poor
dear
going
to
do
if
i
am
going
to
have
any
voice
in
the
matter
said
i
she
is
going
to
marry
he
wrung
me
by
the
hand
enthusiastically
and
declared
that
i
was
the
splendidest
fellow
that
ever
lived
then
he
sighed
i
am
going
about
like
a
sheep
without
a
leader
for
heaven
sake
come
back
into
politics
form
a
hilarious
little
party
of
your
own
anything
so
long
as
you
back
and
take
me
with
come
to
barbara
building
said
i
but
he
made
a
wry
face
and
said
that
he
did
not
think
maisie
would
like
it
i
laughed
and
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
my
son
you
have
a
leader
already
and
she
has
already
tied
a
blue
riband
round
your
woolly
neck
and
she
is
pulling
you
wherever
she
wants
to
go
and
it
all
to
the
infinite
advantage
of
your
eternal
whereupon
he
grinned
and
departed
to
the
sheepfold
at
last
lola
came
she
begged
me
not
to
meet
her
at
the
station
but
to
go
round
after
dinner
to
cadogan
gardens
dawkins
opened
the
door
for
me
and
showed
me
into
the
familiar
the
long
summer
day
was
nearing
its
end
and
only
a
dim
twilight
came
through
the
open
windows
lola
was
standing
rigid
on
the
hearthrug
her
hand
shielding
the
whole
of
the
right
side
of
her
face
with
the
free
hand
she
checked
my
impetuous
advance
stop
and
look
she
said
and
then
dropped
the
shielding
hand
and
stood
before
me
with
twitching
lips
and
death
in
her
eyes
i
saw
in
a
flash
the
devastation
that
had
been
wrought
but
thank
god
i
pierced
beneath
it
to
the
anguish
in
her
heart
the
pity
the
awful
poignant
pity
of
it
smote
me
everything
that
was
man
in
me
surged
towards
her
what
she
saw
in
my
eyes
i
know
not
but
in
hers
dawned
a
sudden
wonder
there
was
no
recoil
of
shock
such
as
she
had
steeled
herself
to
encounter
i
sprang
forward
and
clasped
her
in
my
arms
her
stiffened
frame
gradually
relaxed
and
our
lips
met
and
in
that
kiss
all
fears
and
doubts
were
dissolved
for
ever
some
hours
later
she
said
if
you
are
blind
enough
to
care
for
a
maimed
thing
like
me
i
ca
help
it
i
shall
never
understand
it
to
my
dying
day
she
added
with
a
long
sigh
and
you
will
marry
me
i
suppose
i
got
to
she
replied
and
with
the
old
pantherine
twist
of
her
body
she
slid
from
her
to
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
on
my
knees
and
that
is
the
end
of
my
story
we
were
quietly
married
three
weeks
afterwards
agatha
wishing
to
humour
a
maniac
for
whom
she
retained
an
unreasonable
affection
came
to
the
wedding
and
treated
lola
as
only
a
sweet
lady
could
but
my
doings
passed
her
understanding
as
for
jane
my
other
sister
she
cast
me
from
her
people
who
did
these
things
she
maintained
must
bear
the
consequences
i
bore
them
bravely
it
is
only
now
that
my
name
is
beginning
to
be
noised
abroad
as
that
of
one
who
speaks
with
some
knowledge
on
certain
social
questions
that
jane
holds
out
the
olive
branch
of
fraternal
peace
after
a
brief
honeymoon
lola
insisted
on
joining
me
in
barbara
building
a
set
of
rooms
next
to
mine
was
vacant
and
campion
who
welcomed
a
new
worker
had
the
two
sets
thrown
into
what
term
a
commodious
flat
she
is
now
lady
superior
of
the
institution
the
title
is
campion
and
for
some
odd
feminine
reason
lola
is
delighted
with
it
yes
this
is
the
end
of
the
story
which
i
began
it
seems
in
a
previous
incarnation
at
the
maiming
of
lola
beauty
has
been
the
last
jest
which
the
has
practised
on
me
i
fancy
he
thought
that
this
final
scurvy
trick
would
wipe
simon
de
gex
for
ever
out
of
the
ranks
of
his
rivals
but
i
flatter
myself
that
having
snapped
my
fingers
in
his
face
the
last
laugh
has
been
on
my
side
he
has
withdrawn
discomfited
from
the
conflict
and
left
me
master
of
the
ground
love
conquers
all
even
the
there
are
some
who
still
point
to
me
as
one
who
has
deliberately
ruined
a
brilliant
career
who
pity
me
as
one
who
has
gone
under
who
speak
with
shrugged
shoulders
and
uplifted
eyebrows
at
my
unfortunate
marriage
and
my
obscure
and
cranky
occupation
the
world
they
say
was
at
my
feet
so
it
was
but
what
the
pitying
critics
lack
the
grace
to
understand
is
that
better
than
to
have
it
under
one
feet
is
to
have
it
or
that
of
it
which
matters
at
one
heart
i
sit
in
this
tiny
hotel
by
the
sea
and
reflect
that
it
is
over
three
years
since
i
awoke
from
death
and
assumed
a
new
avatar
and
since
my
marriage
what
have
been
the
happenings
dale
has
just
been
elected
for
the
fensham
division
of
westmoreland
and
he
has
already
begun
the
line
of
sturdy
young
kynnersleys
of
which
i
had
eumoirous
dreams
long
ago
quast
and
the
cats
have
passed
into
alien
hands
anastasius
papadopoulos
is
dead
he
died
three
months
ago
of
angina
pectoris
and
lola
was
with
him
at
the
end
eleanor
faversham
has
married
a
colonial
bishop
campion
too
has
married
and
married
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
whom
one
would
have
thought
of
mating
him
a
frivolous
butterfly
of
a
creature
who
drags
him
to
and
ascot
and
suppers
at
the
savoy
and
holds
barbara
building
and
all
it
connotes
in
vixenish
detestation
he
roars
out
the
agony
of
his
philanthropic
spirit
to
lola
and
myself
who
administer
consolation
and
the
cold
mutton
that
he
loves
the
story
of
his
marriage
is
a
little
lunatic
drama
all
to
itself
and
i
will
tell
it
some
day
but
now
i
can
only
the
facts
he
works
when
he
can
at
the
beloved
creation
of
his
life
and
fortune
but
the
brain
that
would
be
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
a
ferret
controls
the
action
of
this
masterful
enthusiast
and
his
one
awful
despair
in
life
is
to
touch
a
heart
that
might
beat
in
the
bosom
of
a
vicious
and
calculating
haddock
i
only
mention
this
to
explain
how
it
has
come
to
pass
that
lola
and
i
are
now
in
barbara
building
it
has
become
the
child
of
our
adoption
and
we
love
it
with
a
deep
and
almost
fanatic
affection
before
lola
my
influence
and
personality
fade
into
nothingness
she
is
the
power
the
terror
the
adoration
of
lambeth
if
she
chose
she
could
control
the
parliamentary
vote
of
the
borough
her
great
direct
personality
carries
all
before
it
and
with
it
there
is
something
of
the
uncanny
a
feat
of
hers
in
the
early
days
is
by
way
of
becoming
legendary
a
woman
on
the
books
of
the
building
was
about
to
bring
a
hopeless
human
fragment
into
a
grey
world
lola
went
to
see
what
aid
the
building
could
provide
in
front
of
the
door
lounged
the
husband
a
hulking
porter
in
a
bermondsey
factory
glowering
at
his
feet
lay
a
vicious
mongrel
dog
mastiff
so
did
lola
with
her
trained
eye
distinguish
the
strains
when
she
asked
for
his
wife
in
travail
the
chivalrous
gentleman
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
spat
and
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
referred
to
the
disfigurement
of
her
face
in
terms
impossible
to
transcribe
she
paid
no
attention
i
coming
upstairs
to
see
your
if
you
pass
that
door
me
gawd
i
set
the
dog
on
she
paused
he
urged
the
dog
who
bristled
and
growled
and
showed
his
teeth
lola
picked
the
animal
up
as
she
would
have
picked
up
a
sofa
cushion
and
threw
him
across
the
street
she
went
to
where
he
had
fallen
ordered
him
to
his
feet
and
the
dog
licked
her
hand
she
came
back
with
a
laugh
i
do
the
same
to
you
if
you
do
let
me
in
she
pushed
the
hulking
brute
aside
he
resisted
and
laid
hands
on
her
by
some
extraordinary
tamer
art
of
which
she
had
in
vain
tried
to
explain
to
me
the
secret
and
with
no
apparent
effort
she
glided
away
from
him
and
sent
him
cowering
and
subdued
some
feet
beyond
the
lintel
of
the
door
the
street
which
was
watching
went
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
applause
lola
mounted
the
stairs
and
attended
to
the
business
in
hand
when
she
came
down
the
man
was
still
standing
at
the
threshold
smoking
an
obfusticated
pipe
he
blinked
at
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
human
dynamo
come
round
to
barbara
building
at
six
and
tell
me
how
she
he
came
on
the
stroke
of
six
the
fame
of
lola
spread
through
the
borough
and
now
she
can
walk
feared
honoured
unmolested
by
night
or
by
day
through
the
streets
of
horror
and
crime
which
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
no
matter
how
courageous
dare
enter
at
certain
hours
without
the
magical
protection
of
a
policeman
sunshine
has
come
at
last
both
into
this
little
backwater
of
the
world
by
the
sea
and
into
my
own
life
and
it
is
time
i
should
end
this
futile
record
yesterday
as
we
lay
on
the
sands
watching
the
waves
idly
lap
the
shore
lola
brought
herself
nearer
to
me
with
a
rhythmic
movement
as
no
other
creature
form
of
woman
is
capable
of
and
looked
into
my
eyes
and
she
whispered
something
to
me
which
led
to
an
infinite
murmuring
of
foolish
things
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
on
her
cheek
whether
the
beautiful
or
the
maimed
i
knew
not
and
she
sank
into
a
long
long
silence
at
last
she
said
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
said
i
thinking
that
not
a
single
human
being
on
the
face
of
the
earth
has
a
sense
of
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
simply
this
said
i
that
what
has
occurred
billions
of
billions
of
millions
of
times
on
the
earth
we
are
now
regarding
as
the
only
thing
that
ever
well
said
lola
so
it
is
for
us
the
only
thing
that
ever
and
the
astounding
woman
was
right
