what

i
suppose
you
know
all
about
the
stage
and
stage
people
you
been
touched

and
by
actors
and
you
read
the
newspaper
criticisms
and
the
jokes
in
the
weeklies
about
the
rialto
and
the
chorus
girls
and
the
tragedians
and
i
suppose
that
a
condensed
list
of
your
ideas
about
the
mysterious

would
boil
down
to
something
like

until

the

day
after
all
the
moving
pictures
have
got
the
whole
bunch
pounded
to
a
pulp
now
few
of
us
know
the
real
life
of
the
stage
people
if
we
did
the
profession
might
be
more
overcrowded
than
it
is
we
look
askance
at
the
players
with
an
eye
full
of
patronizing
superiority
and
we
go
home
and
practise
all
sorts
of
elocution
and
gestures
in
front
of
our
looking
glasses
latterly
there
has
been
much
talk
of
the
actor
people
in
a
new
light
it
seems
to
have
been
divulged
that
instead
of
being
motoring
bacchanalians
and
they
are
businesslike
folk
students
and
ascetics
with
childer
and
homes
and
libraries
owning
real
estate
and
conducting
their
private
affairs
in
as
orderly
and
unsensational
a
manner
as
any
of
us
good
citizens
who
are
bound
to
the
chariot
wheels
of
the
gas
rent
coal
ice
and
wardmen
whether
the
old
or
the
new
report
of
the
be
the
true
one
is
a
surmise
that
has
no
place
here
i
offer
you
merely
this
little
story
of
two
strollers
and
for
proof
of
its
truth
i
can
show
you
only
the
dark
patch
above
the
of
the
door
of
keetor
old
vaudeville
theatre
made
there
by
the
petulant
push
of
gloved
hands
too
impatient
to
finger
the
clumsy
and
where
i
last
saw
cherry
whisking
through
like
a
swallow
into
her
nest
on
time
to
the
minute
as
usual
to
dress
for
her
act
the
vaudeville
team
of
hart
cherry
was
an
inspiration
bob
hart
had
been
roaming
through
the
eastern
and
western
circuits
for
four
years
with
a
act
comprising
a
monologue
three
lightning
changes
with
songs
a
couple
of
imitations
of
celebrated
imitators
and
a
dance
that
had
drawn
a
glance
of
approval
from
the
player
in
more
than
one
house
than
which
no
performer
ever
received
more
satisfactory
evidence
of
good
work
the
greatest
treat
an
actor
can
have
is
to
witness
the
pitiful
performance
with
which
all
other
actors
desecrate
the
stage
in
order
to
give
himself
this
pleasure
he
will
often
forsake
the
sunniest
broadway
corner
between
and
to
attend
a
matinée
offering
by
his
less
gifted
brothers
once
during
the
lifetime
of
a
minstrel
joke
one
comes
to
scoff
and
remains
to
go
through
with
that
most
difficult
exercise
of
thespian
muscles
the
audible
contact
of
the
palm
of
one
hand
against
the
palm
of
the
other
one
afternoon
bob
hart
presented
his
solvent
serious
vaudevillian
face
at
the
window
of
a
rival
attraction
and
got
his
coupon
for
an
orchestra
seat
a
b
c
and
d
glowed
successively
on
the
announcement
spaces
and
passed
into
oblivion
each
plunging
hart
deeper
into
gloom
others
of
the
audience
shrieked
squirmed
whistled
and
applauded
but
bob
hart
all
the
mustard
and
a
whole
show
in
himself
sat
with
his
face
as
long
and
his
hands
as
far
apart
as
a
boy
holding
a
hank
of
yarn
for
his
grandmother
to
wind
into
a
ball
but
when
h
came
on
the
mustard
suddenly
sat
up
straight
h
was
the
happy
alphabetical
prognosticator
of
winona
cherry
in
character
songs
and
impersonations
there
were
scarcely
more
than
two
bites
to
cherry
but
she
delivered
the
merchandise
tied
with
a
pink
cord
and
charged
to
the
old
man
account
she
first
showed
you
a
deliciously
dewy
and
ginghamy
country
girl
with
a
basket
of
property
daisies
who
informed
you
ingenuously
that
there
were
other
things
to
be
learned
at
the
old
log
besides
cipherin
and
nouns
especially
when
the
kept
me
in
vanishing
with
a
quick
flirt
of
gingham
she
reappeared
in
considerably
less
than
a
trice
as
a
fluffy
parisienne
so
near
does
art
bring
the
old
red
mill
to
the
moulin
rouge
and
then
but
you
know
the
rest
and
so
did
bob
hart
but
he
saw
somebody
else
he
thought
he
saw
that
cherry
was
the
only
professional
on
the
short
order
stage
that
he
had
seen
who
seemed
exactly
to
fit
the
part
of
helen
grimes
in
the
sketch
he
had
written
and
kept
tucked
away
in
the
tray
of
his
trunk
of
course
bob
hart
as
well
as
every
other
normal
actor
grocer
newspaper
man
professor
curb
broker
and
farmer
has
a
play
tucked
away
somewhere
they
tuck
in
trays
of
trunks
trunks
of
trees
desks
haymows
pigeonholes
inside
pockets
vaults
handboxes
and
coal
cellars
waiting
for
frohman
to
call
they
belong
among
the
different
kinds
but
bob
hart
sketch
was
not
destined
to
end
in
a
pickle
jar
he
called
it
mice
will
play
he
had
kept
it
quiet
and
hidden
away
ever
since
he
wrote
it
waiting
to
find
a
partner
who
fitted
his
conception
of
helen
grimes
and
here
was
helen
herself
with
all
the
innocent
abandon
the
youth
the
sprightliness
and
the
flawless
stage
art
that
his
critical
taste
demanded
after
the
act
was
over
hart
found
the
manager
in
the
box
office
and
got
cherry
address
at
five
the
next
afternoon
he
called
at
the
musty
old
house
in
the
west
forties
and
sent
up
his
professional
card
by
daylight
in
a
secular
shirtwaist
and
plain
skirt
with
her
hair
curbed
and
her
sister
of
charity
eyes
winona
cherry
might
have
been
playing
the
part
of
prudence
wise
the
deacon
daughter
in
the
great
unwritten
new
england
drama
not
yet
entitled
anything
i
know
your
act
hart
she
said
after
she
had
looked
over
his
card
carefully
what
did
you
wish
to
see
me
about
i
saw
you
work
last
night
said
hart
i
written
a
sketch
that
been
saving
up
it
for
two
and
i
think
you
can
do
the
other
part
i
thought
i
see
you
about
it
come
in
the
parlor
said
miss
cherry
i
been
wishing
for
something
of
the
sort
i
think
i
like
to
act
instead
of
doing
turns
bob
hart
drew
his
cherished
mice
will
play
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
to
her
read
it
again
please
said
miss
cherry
and
then
she
pointed
out
to
him
clearly
how
it
could
be
improved
by
introducing
a
messenger
instead
of
a
telephone
call
and
cutting
the
dialogue
just
before
the
climax
while
they
were
struggling
with
the
pistol
and
by
completely
changing
the
lines
and
business
of
helen
grimes
at
the
point
where
her
jealousy
overcomes
her
hart
yielded
to
all
her
strictures
without
argument
she
had
at
once
put
her
finger
on
the
sketch
weaker
points
that
was
her
woman
intuition
that
he
had
lacked
at
the
end
of
their
talk
hart
was
willing
to
stake
the
judgment
experience
and
savings
of
his
four
years
of
vaudeville
that
mice
will
play
would
blossom
into
a
perennial
flower
in
the
garden
of
the
circuits
miss
cherry
was
slower
to
decide
after
many
puckerings
of
her
smooth
young
brow
and
tappings
on
her
small
white
teeth
with
the
end
of
a
lead
pencil
she
gave
out
her
dictum
hart
said
she
i
believe
your
sketch
is
going
to
win
out
that
grimes
part
fits
me
like
a
shrinkable
flannel
after
its
first
trip
to
a
handless
hand
laundry
i
can
make
it
stand
out
like
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
at
a
little
mothers
bazaar
and
i
seen
you
work
i
know
what
you
can
do
with
the
other
part
but
business
is
business
how
much
do
you
get
a
week
for
the
stunt
you
do
now
two
hundred
answered
hart
i
get
one
hundred
for
mine
said
cherry
that
about
the
natural
discount
for
a
woman
but
i
live
on
it
and
put
a
few
simoleons
every
week
under
the
loose
brick
in
the
old
kitchen
hearth
the
stage
is
all
right
i
love
it
but
there
something
else
i
love
better
that
a
little
country
home
some
day
with
plymouth
rock
chickens
and
six
ducks
wandering
around
the
yard
now
let
me
tell
you
hart
i
am
strictly
business
if
you
want
me
to
play
the
opposite
part
in
your
sketch
i
do
it
and
i
believe
we
can
make
it
go
and
there
something
else
i
want
to
say
there
no
nonsense
in
my
i
the
and
i
on
the
stage
for
what
it
pays
me
just
as
other
girls
work
in
stores
and
offices
going
to
save
my
money
to
keep
me
when
i
past
doing
my
stunts
no
old
ladies
home
or
retreat
for
imprudent
actresses
for
me
if
you
want
to
make
this
a
business
partnership
hart
with
all
nonsense
cut
out
of
it
i
in
on
it
i
know
something
about
vaudeville
teams
in
general
but
this
would
have
to
be
one
in
particular
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
on
the
stage
for
what
i
can
cart
away
from
it
every
in
a
little
manila
envelope
with
nicotine
stains
on
it
where
the
cashier
has
licked
the
flap
it
kind
of
a
hobby
of
mine
to
want
to
cravenette
myself
for
plenty
of
rainy
days
in
the
future
i
want
you
to
know
just
how
i
am
i
do
know
what
an
restaurant
looks
like
i
drink
only
weak
tea
i
never
spoke
to
a
man
at
a
stage
entrance
in
my
life
and
i
got
money
in
five
savings
banks
miss
cherry
said
bob
hart
in
his
smooth
serious
tones
you
in
on
your
own
terms
i
got
business
pasted
in
my
hat
and
stenciled
on
my
box
when
i
dream
of
nights
i
always
see
a
bungalow
on
the
north
shore
of
long
island
with
a
jap
cooking
clam
broth
and
duckling
in
the
kitchen
and
me
with
the
title
deeds
to
the
place
in
my
pongee
coat
pocket
swinging
in
a
hammock
on
the
side
porch
reading
stanley
into
africa
and
nobody
else
around
you
never
was
interested
in
africa
was
you
miss
cherry
not
any
said
cherry
what
i
going
to
do
with
my
money
is
to
bank
it
you
can
get
four
per
cent
on
deposits
even
at
the
salary
i
been
earning
i
figured
out
that
in
ten
years
i
have
an
income
of
about
a
month
just
from
the
interest
alone
well
i
might
invest
some
of
the
principal
in
a
little
business
say
trimming
hats
or
a
beauty
parlor
and
make
more
well
said
hart
you
got
the
proper
idea
all
right
all
right
anyhow
there
are
mighty
few
actors
that
amount
to
anything
at
all
who
could
fix
themselves
for
the
wet
days
to
come
if
they
save
their
money
instead
of
blowing
it
i
glad
you
got
the
correct
business
idea
of
it
miss
cherry
i
think
the
same
way
and
i
believe
this
sketch
will
more
than
double
what
both
of
us
earn
now
when
we
get
it
shaped
up
the
subsequent
history
of
mice
will
play
is
the
history
of
all
successful
writings
for
the
stage
hart
cherry
cut
it
pieced
it
remodeled
it
performed
surgical
operations
on
the
dialogue
and
business
changed
the
lines
restored
added
more
cut
out
renamed
it
gave
it
back
the
old
name
rewrote
it
substituted
a
dagger
for
the
pistol
restored
the
pistol
put
the
sketch
through
all
the
known
processes
of
condensation
and
improvement
they
rehearsed
it
by
the
boardinghouse
clock
in
the
rarely
used
parlor
until
its
warning
click
at
five
minutes
to
the
hour
would
occur
every
time
exactly
half
a
second
before
the
click
of
the
unloaded
revolver
that
helen
grimes
used
in
rehearsing
the
thrilling
climax
of
the
sketch
yes
that
was
a
thriller
and
a
piece
of
excellent
work
in
the
act
a
real
revolver
was
used
loaded
with
a
real
cartridge
helen
grimes
who
is
a
western
girl
of
decidedly
buffalo
billish
skill
and
daring
is
tempestuously
in
love
with
frank
desmond
the
private
secretary
and
confidential
prospective
of
her
father
arapahoe
grimes
cattle
king
owning
a
ranch
that
judging
by
the
scenery
is
in
either
the
bad
lands
or
amagansett
desmond
in
private
life
bob
hart
wears
puttees
and
meadow
brook
hunt
riding
trousers
and
gives
his
address
as
new
york
leaving
you
to
wonder
why
he
comes
to
the
bad
lands
or
amagansett
as
the
case
may
be
and
at
the
same
time
to
conjecture
mildly
why
a
cattleman
should
want
puttees
about
his
ranch
with
a
secretary
in
well
anyhow
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
we
all
like
that
kind
of
play
whether
we
admit
it
or
not
something
along
in
between
bluebeard
and
cymbeline
played
in
the
russian
there
were
only
two
parts
and
a
half
in
mice
will
play
hart
and
cherry
were
the
two
of
course
and
the
half
was
a
minor
part
always
played
by
a
stage
hand
who
merely
came
in
once
in
a
tuxedo
coat
and
a
panic
to
announce
that
the
house
was
surrounded
by
indians
and
to
turn
down
the
gas
fire
in
the
grate
by
the
manager
orders
there
was
another
girl
in
the
sketch
a
fifth
avenue
society
swelless
who
was
visiting
the
ranch
and
who
had
sirened
jack
valentine
when
he
was
a
wealthy
on
lower
third
avenue
before
he
lost
his
money
this
girl
appeared
on
the
stage
only
in
the
photographic
state
jack
had
her
sarony
stuck
up
on
the
mantel
of
the
amagan
of
the
bad
lands
droring
room
helen
was
jealous
of
course
and
now
for
the
thriller
old
arapahoe
grimes
dies
of
angina
pectoris
one
night
so
helen
informs
us
in
a
whisper
over
the
footlights
while
only
his
secretary
was
present
and
that
same
day
he
was
known
to
have
had
in
cash
in
his
ranch
library
just
received
for
the
sale
of
a
drove
of
beeves
in
the
east
that
accounts
for
the
price
we
pay
for
steak
the
cash
disappears
at
the
same
time
jack
valentine
was
the
only
person
with
the
ranchman
when
he
made
his
alleged
croak
gawd
knows
i
love
him
but
if
he
has
done
this
deed
you
sabe
you
and
then
there
are
some
mean
things
said
about
the
fifth
avenue
girl
who
does
come
on
the
stage
and
can
we
blame
her
with
the
vaudeville
trust
holding
down
prices
until
one
actually
must
be
buttoned
in
the
back
by
a
call
boy
maids
cost
so
much
but
wait
here
the
climax
helen
grimes
chaparralish
as
she
can

she
convinces
herself
that
jack
valentine
is
not
only
a
falsetto
but
a
financier
to
lose
at
one
fell
swoop
and
a
lover
in
riding
trousers
with
angles
in
the
sides
like
the
variations
on
the
chart
of
a
patient
is
enough
to
make
any

mad
so
then
they
stand
in
the
ranch
library
which
is
furnished
with
mounted
elk
heads
did
the
elks
have
a
fish
fry
in
amagensett
once
and
the
dénouement
begins
i
know
of
no
more
interesting
time
in
the
run
of
a
play
unless
it
be
when
the
prologue
ends
helen
thinks
jack
has
taken
the
money
who
else
was
there
to
take
it
the
manager
was
at
the
front
on
his
job
the
orchestra
left
their
seats
and
no
man
could
get
past
old
jimmy
the
stage
unless
he
could
show
a
skye
terrier
or
an
automobile
as
a
guarantee
of
eligibility
goaded
beyond
imprudence
as
before
said
helen
says
to
jack
valentine
robber
and
thief
and
worse
yet
stealer
of
trusting
hearts
this
should
be
your
fate
with
that
out
she
whips
of
course
the
trusty
but
i
will
be
merciful
goes
on
helen
you
shall
live
that
will
be
your
punishment
i
will
show
you
how
easily
i
could
have
sent
you
to
the
death
that
you
deserve
there
is
picture
on
the
mantel
i
will
send
through
her
more
beautiful
face
the
bullet
that
should
have
pierced
your
craven
heart
and
she
does
it
and
there
no
fake
blank
cartridges
or
assistants
pulling
strings
helen
fires
the
bullet
the
actual
bullet
goes
through
the
face
of
the
photograph
and
then
strikes
the
hidden
spring
of
the
sliding
panel
in
the
wall
and
lo
the
panel
slides
and
there
is
the
missing
in
convincing
stacks
of
currency
and
bags
of
gold
it
great
you
know
how
it
is
cherry
practised
for
two
months
at
a
target
on
the
roof
of
her
boarding
house
it
took
good
shooting
in
the
sketch
she
had
to
hit
a
brass
disk
only
three
inches
in
diameter
covered
by
wall
paper
in
the
panel
and
she
had
to
stand
in
exactly
the
same
spot
every
night
and
the
photo
had
to
be
in
exactly
the
same
spot
and
she
had
to
shoot
steady
and
true
every
time
of
course
old
arapahoe
had
tucked
the
funds
away
there
in
the
secret
place
and
of
course
jack
had
taken
anything
except
his
salary
which
really
might
have
come
under
the
head
of
obtaining
money
under
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
and
of
course
the
new
york
girl
was
really
engaged
to
a
concrete
house
contractor
in
the
bronx
and
necessarily
jack
and
helen
ended
in
a
and
there
you
are
after
hart
and
cherry
had
gotten
mice
will
play
flawless
they
had
a
at
a
vaudeville
house
that
accommodates
the
sketch
was
a
house
wrecker
it
was
one
of
those
rare
strokes
of
talent
that
inundates
a
theatre
from
the
roof
down
the
gallery
wept
and
the
orchestra
seats
being
dressed
for
it
swam
in
tears
after
the
show
the
booking
agents
signed
blank
checks
and
pressed
fountain
pens
upon
hart
and
cherry
five
hundred
dollars
a
week
was
what
it
panned
out
that
night
at
bob
hart
took
off
his
hat
and
bade
cherry
good
night
at
her
door
hart
said
she
thoughtfully
come
inside
just
a
few
minutes
we
got
our
chance
now
to
make
good
and
make
money
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
cut
expenses
every
cent
we
can
and
save
all
we
can
right
said
bob
it
business
with
me
you
got
your
scheme
for
banking
yours
and
i
dream
every
night
of
that
bungalow
with
the
jap
cook
and
nobody
around
to
raise
trouble
anything
to
enlarge
the
net
receipts
will
engage
my
attention
come
inside
just
a
few
minutes
repeated
cherry
deeply
thoughtful
i
got
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
that
will
reduce
our
expenses
a
lot
and
help
you
work
out
your
own
future
and
help
me
work
out
mine
and
all
on
business
principles
mice
will
play
had
a
tremendously
successful
run
in
new
york
for
ten
weeks
rather
neat
for
a
vaudeville
sketch
and
then
it
started
on
the
circuits
without
following
it
it
may
be
said
that
it
was
a
solid
drawing
card
for
two
years
without
a
sign
of
abated
popularity
sam
packard
manager
of
one
of
keetor
new
york
houses
said
of
hart
cherry
as
square
and
a
little
team
as
ever
came
over
the
circuit
it
a
pleasure
to
read
their
names
on
the
booking
list
quiet
hard
workers
no
johnny
and
mabel
nonsense
on
the
job
to
the
minute
straight
home
after
their
act
and
each
of
as
gentlemanlike
as
a
lady
i
do
expect
to
handle
any
attractions
that
give
me
less
trouble
or
more
respect
for
the
profession
and
now
after
so
much
cracking
of
a
nutshell
here
is
the
kernel
of
the
story
at
the
end
of
its
second
season
mice
will
play
came
back
to
new
york
for
another
run
at
the
roof
gardens
and
summer
theatres
there
was
never
any
trouble
in
booking
it
at
the
price
bob
hart
had
his
bungalow
nearly
paid
for
and
cherry
had
so
many
bank
books
that
she
had
begun
to
buy
sectional
bookcases
on
the
instalment
plan
to
hold
them
i
tell
you
these
things
to
assure
you
even
if
you
ca
believe
it
that
many
very
many
of
the
stage
people
are
workers
with
abiding
ambitions
just
the
same
as
the
man
who
wants
to
be
president
or
the
grocery
clerk
who
wants
a
home
in
flatbush
or
a
lady
who
is
anxious
to
flop
out
of
the
into
the
and
i
hope
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
without
chipping
into
the
contribution
basket
that
they
often
move
in
a
mysterious
way
their
wonders
to
perform
but
listen
at
the
first
performance
of
mice
will
play
in
new
york
at
the
westphalia
no
hams
alluded
to
theatre
winona
cherry
was
nervous
when
she
fired
at
the
photograph
of
the
eastern
beauty
on
the
mantel
the
bullet
instead
of
penetrating
the
photo
and
then
striking
the
disk
went
into
the
lower
left
side
of
bob
hart
neck
not
expecting
to
get
it
there
hart
collapsed
neatly
while
cherry
fainted
in
a
most
artistic
manner
the
audience
surmising
that
they
viewed
a
comedy
instead
of
a
tragedy
in
which
the
principals
were
married
or
reconciled
applauded
with
great
enjoyment
the
cool
head
who
always
graces
such
occasions
rang
the
curtain
down
and
two
platoons
of
scene
shifters
respectively
and
more
or
less
respectfully
removed
hart
cherry
from
the
stage
the
next
turn
went
on
and
all
went
as
merry
as
an
alimony
bell
the
stage
hands
found
a
young
doctor
at
the
stage
entrance
who
was
waiting
for
a
patient
with
a
decoction
of
am
roses
the
doctor
examined
hart
carefully
and
laughed
heartily
no
headlines
for
you
old
sport
was
his
diagnosis
if
it
had
been
two
inches
to
the
left
it
would
have
undermined
the
carotid
artery
as
far
as
the
red
front
drug
store
in
flatbush
and
back
again
as
it
is
you
just
get
the
property
man
to
bind
it
up
with
a
flounce
torn
from
any
one
of
the
girls
valenciennes
and
go
home
and
get
it
dressed
by
the
practitioner
on
your
block
and
you
be
all
right
excuse
me
i
got
a
serious
case
outside
to
look
after
after
that
bob
hart
looked
up
and
felt
better
and
then
to
where
he
lay
came
vincente
the
tramp
juggler
great
in
his
line
vincente
a
solemn
man
from
brattleboro
named
sam
griggs
at
home
sent
toys
and
maple
sugar
home
to
two
small
daughters
from
every
town
he
played
vincente
had
moved
on
the
same
circuits
with
hart
cherry
and
was
their
peripatetic
friend
bob
said
vincente
in
his
serious
way
i
glad
it
no
worse
the
little
lady
is
wild
about
you
who
asked
hart
cherry
said
the
juggler
we
did
know
how
bad
you
were
hurt
and
we
kept
her
away
it
taking
the
manager
and
three
girls
to
hold
her
it
was
an
accident
of
course
said
hart
cherry
all
right
she
was
feeling
in
good
trim
or
she
could
have
done
it
there
no
hard
feelings
she
strictly
business
the
doctor
says
i
be
on
the
job
again
in
three
days
do
let
her
worry
man
said
sam
griggs
severely
puckering
his
old
smooth
lined
face
are
you
a
chess
automaton
or
a
human
pincushion
cherry
crying
her
heart
out
for
you
calling
bob
every
second
with
them
holding
her
hands
and
keeping
her
from
coming
to
you
what
the
matter
with
her
asked
hart
with
eyes
the
sketch
go
on
again
in
three
days
i
not
hurt
bad
the
doctor
says
she
wo
lose
out
half
a
week
salary
i
know
it
was
an
accident
what
the
matter
with
her
you
seem
to
be
blind
or
a
sort
of
a
fool
said
vincente
the
girl
loves
you
and
is
almost
mad
about
your
hurt
what
the
matter
with
is
she
nothing
to
you
i
wish
you
could
hear
her
call
you
loves
me
asked
bob
hart
rising
from
the
stack
of
scenery
on
which
he
lay
cherry
loves
me
why
it
impossible
i
wish
you
could
see
her
and
hear
her
said
griggs
but
man
said
bob
hart
sitting
up
it
impossible
impossible
i
tell
you
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
no
human
being
said
the
tramp
juggler
could
mistake
it
she
wild
for
love
of
you
how
have
you
been
so
blind
but
my
god
said
bob
hart
rising
to
his
feet
it
too
late
i
tell
you
sam
too
it
ca
be
you
must
be
wrong
it
there
some
mistake
she
crying
for
you
said
the
tramp
juggler
for
love
of
you
fighting
three
and
calling
your
name
so
loud
they
do
dare
to
raise
the
curtain
wake
up
man
for
love
of
me
said
bob
hart
with
staring
eyes
do
i
tell
you
it
too
late
it
too
late
man
why
and
i
have
been
married
two
years
ii
the
gold
that
glittered
a
story
with
a
moral
appended
is
like
the
bill
of
a
mosquito
it
bores
you
and
then
injects
a
stinging
drop
to
irritate
your
conscience
therefore
let
us
have
the
moral
first
and
be
done
with
it
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
but
it
is
a
wise
child
that
keeps
the
stopper
in
his
bottle
of
testing
acid
where
broadway
skirts
the
corner
of
the
square
presided
over
by
george
the
veracious
is
the
little
rialto
here
stand
the
actors
of
that
quarter
and
this
is
their
shibboleth
says
i
to
frohman
ca
touch
me
for
a
kopeck
less
than
per
and
out
i
walks
westward
and
southward
from
the
thespian
glare
are
one
or
two
streets
where
a
colony
has
huddled
for
a
little
tropical
warmth
in
the
nipping
north
the
centre
of
life
in
this
precinct
is
el
refugio
a
café
and
restaurant
that
caters
to
the
volatile
exiles
from
the
south
up
from
chili
bolivia
colombia
the
rolling
republics
of
central
america
and
the
ireful
islands
of
the
western
indies
flit
the
cloaked
and
sombreroed
señores
who
are
scattered
like
burning
lava
by
the
political
eruptions
of
their
several
countries
hither
they
come
to
lay
counterplots
to
bide
their
time
to
solicit
funds
to
enlist
filibusterers
to
smuggle
out
arms
and
ammunitions
to
play
the
game
at
long
taw
in
el
refugio
they
find
the
atmosphere
in
which
they
thrive
in
the
restaurant
of
el
refugio
are
served
compounds
delightful
to
the
palate
of
the
man
from

the

thus
long
on

weary
of
the
culinary
subterfuges
of
the
gallic

hie
thee
to
el

there
only
will
you
find
a
fish
bluefish
shad
or
pompano
from
the
gulf
baked
after
the
spanish
method
tomatoes
give
it
color
individuality
and
soul
chili
colorado
bestows
upon
it
zest
originality
and
fervor
unknown
herbs
furnish
piquancy
and
mystery
and
but
its
crowning
glory
deserves
a
new
sentence
around
it
above
it
beneath
it
in
its
vicinity
but
never
in
it
hovers
an
ethereal
aura
an
effluvium
so
rarefied
and
delicate
that
only
the
society
for
psychical
research
could
note
its
origin
do
not
say
that
garlic
is
in
the
fish
at
el
refugio
it
is
not
otherwise
than
as
if
the
spirit
of
garlic
flitting
past
has
wafted
one
kiss
that
lingers
in
the
dish
as
haunting
as
those
kisses
in
life
by
hopeless
fancy
feigned
on
lips
that
are
for
others
and
then
when
conchito
the
waiter
brings
you
a
plate
of
brown
frijoles
and
a
carafe
of
wine
that
has
never
stood
still
between
oporto
and
el
refugio
ah
dios
one
day
a
liner
deposited
upon
pier
no
perrico
ximenes
villablanca
falcon
a
passenger
from
cartagena
the
general
was
between
a
claybank
and
a
bay
in
complexion
had
a
waist
and
stood
feet
with
his
du
barry
heels
he
had
the
mustache
of
a
proprietor
he
wore
the
full
dress
of
a
texas
congressman
and
had
the
important
aspect
of
an
uninstructed
delegate
falcon
had
enough
english
under
his
hat
to
enable
him
to
inquire
his
way
to
the
street
in
which
el
refugio
stood
when
he
reached
that
neighborhood
he
saw
a
sign
before
a
respectable
house
that
read
hotel
español
in
the
window
was
a
card
in
spanish
aqui
se
habla
español
the
general
entered
sure
of
a
congenial
port
in
the
cozy
office
was
the
proprietress
she
had
blond
oh
unimpeachably
blond
hair
for
the
rest
she
was
amiability
and
ran
largely
to
inches
around
falcon
brushed
the
floor
with
his
hat
and
emitted
a
quantity
of
spanish
the
syllables
sounding
like
firecrackers
gently
popping
their
way
down
the
string
of
a
bunch
spanish
or
dago
asked
pleasantly
i
am
a
colombian
madam
said
the
general
proudly
i
speak
the
spanish
the
advisement
in
your
window
say
the
spanish
he
is
spoken
here
how
is
that
well
you
been
speaking
it
ai
you
said
the
madam
i
sure
i
ca
at
the
hotel
español
general
falcon
engaged
rooms
and
established
himself
at
dusk
he
sauntered
out
upon
the
streets
to
view
the
wonders
of
this
roaring
city
of
the
north
as
he
walked
he
thought
of
the
wonderful
golden
hair
of
mme
it
is
here
said
the
general
to
himself
no
doubt
in
his
own
language
that
one
shall
find
the
most
beautiful
señoras
in
the
world
i
have
not
in
my
colombia
viewed
among
our
beauties
one
so
fair
but
no
it
is
not
for
the
general
falcon
to
think
of
beauty
it
is
my
country
that
claims
my
devotion
at
the
corner
of
broadway
and
the
little
rialto
the
general
became
involved
the
street
cars
bewildered
him
and
the
fender
of
one
upset
him
against
a
pushcart
laden
with
oranges
a
cab
driver
missed
him
an
inch
with
a
hub
and
poured
barbarous
execrations
upon
his
head
he
scrambled
to
the
sidewalk
and
skipped
again
in
terror
when
the
whistle
of
a
puffed
a
hot
scream
in
his
ear
válgame
dios
what
devil
city
is
this
as
the
general
fluttered
out
of
the
streamers
of
passers
like
a
wounded
snipe
he
was
marked
simultaneously
as
game
by
two
hunters
one
was
bully
mcguire
whose
system
of
sport
required
the
use
of
a
strong
arm
and
the
misuse
of
an
piece
of
lead
pipe
the
other
nimrod
of
the
asphalt
was
spider
kelley
a
sportsman
with
more
refined
methods
in
pouncing
upon
their
prey
kelley
was
a
shade
the
quicker
his
elbow
fended
accurately
the
onslaught
of
mcguire
he
commanded
harshly
i
saw
it
first
mcguire
slunk
away
awed
by
superior
intelligence
pardon
me
said
kelley
to
the
general
but
you
got
balled
up
in
the
shuffle
did
you
let
me
assist
you
he
picked
up
the
hat
and
brushed
the
dust
from
it
the
ways
of
kelley
could
not
but
succeed
the
general
bewildered
and
dismayed
by
the
resounding
streets
welcomed
his
deliverer
as
a
caballero
with
a
most
disinterested
heart
i
have
a
desire
said
the
general
to
return
to
the
hotel
of
in
which
i
am
stop
caramba
señor
there
is
a
loudness
and
rapidness
of
going
and
coming
in
the
city
of
this
nueva
york
kelley
politeness
would
not
suffer
the
distinguished
colombian
to
brave
the
dangers
of
the
return
unaccompanied
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
español
they
paused
a
little
lower
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
shone
the
modest
illuminated
sign
of
el
refugio
kelley
to
whom
few
streets
were
unfamiliar
knew
the
place
exteriorly
as
a
dago
joint
all
foreigners
kelley
classed
under
the
two
heads
of
dagoes
and
frenchmen
he
proposed
to
the
general
that
they
repair
thither
and
substantiate
their
acquaintance
with
a
liquid
foundation
an
hour
later
found
general
falcon
and
kelley
seated
at
a
table
in
the
conspirator
corner
of
el
refugio
bottles
and
glasses
were
between
them
for
the
tenth
time
the
general
confided
the
secret
of
his
mission
to
the
estados
unidos
he
was
here
he
declared
to
purchase
arms
stands
of
winchester
rifles
for
the
colombian
revolutionists
he
had
drafts
in
his
pocket
drawn
by
the
cartagena
bank
on
its
new
york
correspondent
for
at
other
tables
other
revolutionists
were
shouting
their
political
secrets
to
their
but
none
was
as
loud
as
the
general
he
pounded
the
table
he
hallooed
for
some
wine
he
roared
to
his
friend
that
his
errand
was
a
secret
one
and
not
to
be
hinted
at
to
a
living
soul
kelley
himself
was
stirred
to
sympathetic
enthusiasm
he
grasped
the
general
hand
across
the
table
monseer
he
said
earnestly
i
do
know
where
this
country
of
yours
is
but
i
for
it
i
guess
it
must
be
a
branch
of
the
united
states
though
for
the
poetry
guys
and
the
schoolmarms
call
us
columbia
too
sometimes
it
a
lucky
thing
for
you
that
you
butted
into
me
i
the
only
man
in
new
york
that
can
get
this
gun
deal
through
for
you
the
secretary
of
war
of
the
united
states

me
best
friend
he
in
the
city

meantime

you
to
see
him

the
district
of

kelley
with
a
sudden
qualm

exclaimed
the
general

of
colombia

a
republic
on
the
top
side
of
america
of
the
south

kelley
reassured
now
suppose

trek
along
home
and
go
i
write
to
the
secretary
and

a
date
with
him
it
a
ticklish
job
to

new
york
mcclusky
himself
ca

it
they
parted
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
español
the
general
rolled
his
eyes
at
the
moon
and
sighed
it
is
a
great
country
your
nueva
york
he
said
truly
the
cars
in
the
streets
devastate
one
and
the
engine
that
cooks
the
nuts
terribly
makes
a
squeak
in
the
ear
but
ah
señor
kelley
the
señoras
with
hair
of
much
goldness
and
admirable
fatness
they
are
magnificas
muy
magnificas
kelley
went
to
the
nearest
telephone
booth
and
called
up
mccrary
café
far
up
on
broadway
he
asked
for
jimmy
dunn
is
that
jimmy
dunn
asked
kelley
yes
came
the
answer
you
a
liar
sang
back
kelley
joyfully
you
the
secretary
of
war
wait
there
till
i
come
up
i
got
the
finest
thing
down
here
in
the
way
of
a
fish
you
ever
baited
for
it
a
with
a
gold
band
around
it
and
free
coupons
enough
to
buy
a
red
hall
lamp
and
a
statuette
of
psyche
rubbering
in
the
brook
i
be
up
on
the
next
car
jimmy
dunn
was
an
of
crookdom
he
was
an
artist
in
the
confidence
line
he
never
saw
a
bludgeon
in
his
life
and
he
scorned
knockout
drops
in
fact
he
would
have
set
nothing
before
an
intended
victim
but
the
purest
of
drinks
if
it
had
been
possible
to
procure
such
a
thing
in
new
york
it
was
the
ambition
of
spider
kelley
to
elevate
himself
into
jimmy
class
these
two
gentlemen
held
a
conference
that
night
at
mccrary
kelley
explained
he
as
easy
as
a
gumshoe
he
from
the
island
of
colombia
where
there
a
strike
or
a
feud
or
something
going
on
and
they
sent
him
up
here
to
buy
winchesters
to
arbitrate
the
thing
with
he
showed
me
two
drafts
for
each
and
one
for
on
a
bank
here
truth
jimmy
i
felt
real
mad
with
him
because
he
did
have
it
in
bills
and
hand
it
to
me
on
a
silver
waiter
now
got
to
wait
till
he
goes
to
the
bank
and
gets
the
money
for
us
they
talked
it
over
for
two
hours
and
then
dunn
said
bring
him
to
no
broadway
at
four
afternoon
in
due
time
kelley
called
at
the
hotel
español
for
the
general
he
found
the
wily
warrior
engaged
in
delectable
conversation
with
the
secretary
of
war
is
waitin
for
us
said
kelley
the
general
tore
himself
away
with
an
effort
ay
señor
he
said
with
a
sigh
duty
makes
a
call
but
señor
the
señoras
of
your
estados
unidos
how
beauties
for
exemplification
take
you
la
madame
que
magnifica
she
is
one
goddess
one
juno
what
you
call
one
juno
now
kelley
was
a
wit
and
better
men
have
been
shriveled
by
the
fire
of
their
own
imagination
sure
he
said
with
a
grin
but
you
mean
a
peroxide
juno
do
you
heard
and
lifted
an
auriferous
head
her
businesslike
eye
rested
for
an
instant
upon
the
disappearing
form
of
kelley
except
in
street
cars
one
should
never
be
unnecessarily
rude
to
a
lady
when
the
gallant
colombian
and
his
escort
arrived
at
the
broadway
address
they
were
held
in
an
anteroom
for
half
an
hour
and
then
admitted
into
a
office
where
a
distinguished
looking
man
with
a
smooth
face
wrote
at
a
desk
general
falcon
was
presented
to
the
secretary
of
war
of
the
united
states
and
his
mission
made
known
by
his
old
friend
kelley
ah
colombia
said
the
secretary
significantly
when
he
was
made
to
understand
i
afraid
there
will
be
a
little
difficulty
in
that
case
the
president
and
i
differ
in
our
sympathies
there
he
prefers
the
established
government
while
i
the
secretary
gave
the
general
a
mysterious
but
encouraging
smile
you
of
course
know
general
falcon
that
since
the
tammany
war
an
act
of
congress
has
been
passed
requiring
all
manufactured
arms
and
ammunition
exported
from
this
country
to
pass
through
the
war
department
now
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
i
will
be
glad
to
do
so
to
oblige
my
old
friend
kelley
but
it
must
be
in
absolute
secrecy
as
the
president
as
i
have
said
does
not
regard
favorably
the
efforts
of
your
revolutionary
party
in
colombia
i
will
have
my
orderly
bring
a
list
of
the
available
arms
now
in
the
warehouse
the
secretary
struck
a
bell
and
an
orderly
with
the
letters
on
his
cap
stepped
promptly
into
the
room
bring
me
schedule
b
of
the
small
arms
inventory
said
the
secretary
the
orderly
quickly
returned
with
a
printed
paper
the
secretary
studied
it
closely
i
find
he
said
that
in
warehouse
of
government
stores
there
is
shipment
of
stands
of
winchester
rifles
that
were
ordered
by
the
sultan
of
morocco
who
forgot
to
send
the
cash
with
his
order
our
rule
is
that
money
must
be
paid
down
at
the
time
of
purchase
my
dear
kelley
your
friend
general
falcon
shall
have
this
lot
of
arms
if
he
desires
it
at
the
manufacturer
price
and
you
will
forgive
me
i
am
sure
if
i
curtail
our
interview
i
am
expecting
the
japanese
minister
and
charles
murphy
every
moment
as
one
result
of
this
interview
the
general
was
deeply
grateful
to
his
esteemed
friend
kelley
as
another
the
nimble
secretary
of
war
was
extremely
busy
during
the
next
two
days
buying
empty
rifle
cases
and
filling
them
with
bricks
which
were
then
stored
in
a
warehouse
rented
for
that
purpose
as
still
another
when
the
general
returned
to
the
hotel
español
went
up
to
him
plucked
a
thread
from
his
lapel
and
said
say
señor
i
do
want
to
in
but
what
does
that
tin
horn
tough
want
with
you
sangre
de
mi
vida
exclaimed
the
general
impossible
it
is
that
you
speak
of
my
good
friend
señor
kelley
come
into
the
summer
garden
said
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
let
us
suppose
that
an
hour
has
elapsed
and
you
say
said
the
general
that
for
the
sum
of
can
be
purchased
the
furnishment
of
the
house
and
the
lease
of
one
year
with
this
garden
so
lovely
so
resembling
unto
the
patios
of
my
cara
colombia
and
dirt
cheap
at
that
sighed
the
lady
ah

general
falcon
what
to
me
is
war
and
politics
this
spot
is
one
paradise
my
country

brave
heroes

continue
the
fighting

shooting

is
here

have
found
one
angel
let
us
buy
the
hotel
español
and
you
shall
be
mine
and
the
money
shall
not
be
waste
on
guns
rested
her
blond
pompadour
against
the
shoulder
of
the
colombian
patriot
oh
señor
she
sighed
happily
ai
you
terrible
two
days
later
was
the
time
appointed
for
the
delivery
of
the
arms
to
the
general
the
boxes
of
supposed
rifles
were
stacked
in
the
rented
warehouse
and
the
secretary
of
war
sat
upon
them
waiting
for
his
friend
kelley
to
fetch
the
victim
kelley
hurried
at
the
hour
to
the
hotel
español
he
found
the
general
behind
the
desk
adding
up
accounts
i
have
decide
said
the
general
to
buy
not

have
buy

insides
of
this
hotel
and

villablanca

with
la
madame

almost
strangled

bottle
of
shoe

he
spluttered
a
swindler
that
what
you
are
you
bought
a
boarding
house
with
money
belonging
to
your
infernal
country
wherever
it
is
ah
said
the
general
footing
up
a
column
that
is
what
you
call
politics
war
and
revolution
they
are
not
nice
yes
it
is
not
best
that
one

minerva
no
it
is
of
quite
desirable
to
keep
hotels
and

with
that
juno
that
juno
ah
what
hair
of
the
gold
it
is
that
she
have
kelley
choked
again
ah
senor
kelley
said
the
general
feelingly
and
finally
is
it
that
you
have
never
eaten
of
the
corned
beef
hash
that
madame
she
make
iii
babes
in
the
jungle
montague
silver
the
finest
street
man
and
art
grafter
in
the
west
says
to
me
once
in
little
rock
if
you
ever
lose
your
mind
billy
and
get
too
old
to
do
honest
swindling
among
grown
men
go
to
new
york
in
the
west
a
sucker
is
born
every
minute
but
in
new
york
they
appear
in
chunks
of
roe
you
ca
count
two
years
afterward
i
found
that
i
could
remember
the
names
of
the
russian
admirals
and
i
noticed
some
gray
hairs
over
my
left
ear
so
i
knew
the
time
had
arrived
for
me
to
take
silver
advice
i
struck
new
york
about
noon
one
day
and
took
a
walk
up
broadway
and
i
run
against
silver
himself
all
encompassed
up
in
a
spacious
kind
of
haberdashery
leaning
against
a
hotel
and
rubbing
the
on
his
nails
with
a
silk
handkerchief
paresis
or
superannuated
i
asks
him
hello
billy
says
silver
i
glad
to
see
you
yes
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
west
was
accumulating
a
little
too
much
wiseness
i
been
saving
new
york
for
dessert
i
know
it
a
trick
to
take
things
from
these
people
they
only
know
this
and
that
and
pass
to
and
fro
and
think
ever
and
anon
i
hate
for
my
mother
to
know
i
was
skinning
these
ones
she
raised
me
better
is
there
a
crush
already
in
the
waiting
rooms
of
the
old
doctor
that
does
skin
grafting
i
asks
well
no
says
silver
you
need
back
epidermis
to
win
i
only
been
here
a
month
but
i
ready
to
begin
and
the
members
of
willie
manhattan
sunday
school
class
each
of
whom
has
volunteered
to
contribute
a
portion
of
cuticle
toward
this
rehabilitation
may
as
well
send
their
photos
to
the
i
been
studying
the
town
says
silver
and
reading
the
papers
every
day
and
i
know
it
as
well
as
the
cat
in
the
city
hall
knows
an
people
here
lie
down
on
the
floor
and
scream
and
kick
when
you
are
the
least
bit
slow
about
taking
money
from
them
come
up
in
my
room
and
i
tell
you
we
work
the
town
together
billy
for
the
sake
of
old
times
silver
takes
me
up
in
a
hotel
he
has
a
quantity
of
irrelevant
objects
lying
about
there
more
ways
of
getting
money
from
these
metropolitan
hayseeds
says
silver
than
there
is
of
cooking
rice
in
charleston
bite
at
anything
the
brains
of
most
of
commute
the
wiser
they
are
in
intelligence
the
less
perception
of
cognizance
they
have
why
a
man
the
other
day
sell
morgan
an
oil
portrait
of
rockefeller
for
andrea
del
sarto
celebrated
painting
of
the
young
saint
john
you
see
that
bundle
of
printed
stuff
in
the
corner
billy
that
gold
mining
stock
i
started
out
one
day
to
sell
that
but
i
quit
it
in
two
hours
why
got
arrested
for
blocking
the
street
people
fought
to
buy
it
i
sold
the
policeman
a
block
of
it
on
the
way
to
the
and
then
i
took
it
off
the
market
i
do
want
people
to
give
me
their
money
i
want
some
little
consideration
connected
with
the
transaction
to
keep
my
pride
from
being
hurt
i
want
to
guess
the
missing
letter
in
chic
go
or
draw
to
a
pair
of
nines
before
they
pay
me
a
cent
of
money
now
there
another
little
scheme
that
worked
so
easy
i
had
to
quit
it
you
see
that
bottle
of
blue
ink
on
the
table
i
tattooed
an
anchor
on
the
back
of
my
hand
and
went
to
a
bank
and
told
i
was
admiral
dewey
nephew
they
offered
to
cash
my
draft
on
him
for
a
thousand
but
i
did
know
my
uncle
first
name
it
shows
though
what
an
easy
town
it
is
as
for
burglars
they
wo
go
in
a
house
now
unless
there
a
hot
supper
ready
and
a
few
college
students
to
wait
on
slugging
citizens
all
over
the
upper
part
of
the
city
and
i
guess
taking
the
town
from
end
to
end
it
a
plain
case
of
assault
and
battery
monty
says
i
when
silver
had
slacked
up
you
may
have
manhattan
correctly
discriminated
in
your
perorative
but
i
doubt
it
i
only
been
in
town
two
hours
but
it
do
dawn
upon
me
that
it
ours
with
a
cherry
in
it
there
ai
enough
rus
in
urbe
about
it
to
suit
me
i
be
a
good
deal
much
better
satisfied
if
the
citizens
had
a
straw
or
more
in
their
hair
and
run
more
to
velveteen
vests
and
buckeye
watch
charms
they
do
look
easy
to
me
you
got
it
billy
says
silver
all
emigrants
have
it
new
bigger
than
little
rock
or
europe
and
it
frightens
a
foreigner
be
all
right
i
tell
you
i
feel
like
slapping
the
people
here
because
they
do
send
me
all
their
money
in
laundry
baskets
with
germicide
sprinkled
over
it
i
hate
to
go
down
on
the
street
to
get
it
who
wears
the
diamonds
in
this
town
why
winnie
the
wiretapper
wife
and
bella
the
buncosteerer
bride
new
yorkers
can
be
worked
easier
than
a
blue
rose
on
a
tidy
the
only
thing
that
bothers
me
is
i
know
i
break
the
cigars
in
my
vest
pocket
when
i
get
my
clothes
all
full
of
twenties
i
hope
you
are
right
monty
says
i
but
i
wish
all
the
same
i
had
been
satisfied
with
a
small
business
in
little
rock
the
crop
of
farmers
is
never
so
short
out
there
but
what
you
can
get
a
few
of
to
sign
a
petition
for
a
new
post
office
that
you
can
discount
for
at
the
county
bank
the
people
here
appear
to
possess
instincts
of
and
illiberality
i
fear
me
that
we
are
not
cultured
enough
to
tackle
this
game
do
worry
says
silver
i
got
this
correctly
estimated
as
sure
as
north
river
is
the
hudson
and
east
river
ai
a
river
why
there
are
people
living
in
four
blocks
of
broadway
who
never
saw
any
kind
of
a
building
except
a
skyscraper
in
their
lives
a
good
live
hustling
western
man
ought
to
get
conspicuous
enough
here
inside
of
three
months
to
incur
either
jerome
clemency
or
displeasure
hyperbole
aside
says
i
do
you
know
of
any
immediate
system
of
buncoing
the
community
out
of
a
dollar
or
two
except
by
applying
to
the
salvation
army
or
having
a
fit
on
miss
helen
gould
doorsteps
dozens
of
says
silver
how
much
capital
have
you
got
billy
a
thousand
i
told
him
i
got
says
he
we
pool
and
do
a
big
piece
of
business
there
so
many
ways
we
can
make
a
million
that
i
do
know
how
to
begin
the
next
morning
silver
meets
me
at
the
hotel
and
he
is
all
sonorous
and
stirred
with
a
kind
of
silent
joy
we
to
meet
morgan
this
afternoon
says
he
a
man
i
know
in
the
hotel
wants
to
introduce
us
he
a
friend
of
his
he
says
he
likes
to
meet
people
from
the
west
that
sounds
nice
and
plausible
says
i
i
like
to
know
mr
morgan
it
wo
hurt
us
a
bit
says
silver
to
get
acquainted
with
a
few
finance
kings
i
kind
of
like
the
social
way
new
york
has
with
strangers
the
man
silver
knew
was
named
klein
at
three
klein
brought
his
wall
street
friend
to
see
us
in
silver
room
morgan
looked
some
like
his
pictures
and
he
had
a
turkish
towel
wrapped
around
his
left
foot
and
he
walked
with
a
cane
silver
and
pescud
says
klein
it
sounds
superfluous
says
he
to
mention
the
name
of
the
greatest
financial
cut
it
out
klein
says
morgan
i
glad
to
know
you
gents
i
take
great
interest
in
the
west
klein
tells
me
you
from
little
rock
i
think
i
a
railroad
or
two
out
there
somewhere
if
either
of
you
guys
would
like
to
deal
a
hand
or
two
of
stud
poker
i
now
pierpont
cuts
in
klein
you
forget
excuse
me
gents
says
morgan
since
i
had
the
gout
so
bad
i
sometimes
play
a
social
game
of
cards
at
my
house
neither
of
you
never
knew
peters
did
you
while
you
was
around
little
rock
he
lived
in
seattle
new
mexico
before
we
could
answer
morgan
hammers
on
the
floor
with
his
cane
and
begins
to
walk
up
and
down
swearing
in
a
loud
tone
of
voice
they
have
been
pounding
your
stocks
on
the
street
pierpont
asks
klein
smiling
stocks
no
roars
morgan
it
that
picture
i
sent
an
agent
to
europe
to
buy
i
just
thought
about
it
he
cabled
me
that
it
ai
to
be
found
in
all
italy
i
pay
for
that
picture
yes
i
give
the
agent
a
la
carte
in
purchasing
it
i
can
not
understand
why
the
art
galleries
will
allow
a
de
vinchy
to
why
morgan
says
klein
i
thought
you
owned
all
of
the
de
vinchy
paintings
what
is
the
picture
like
mr
morgan
asks
silver
it
must
be
as
big
as
the
side
of
the
flatiron
building
i
afraid
your
art
education
is
on
the
bum
silver
says
morgan
the
picture
is
inches
by
and
it
is
called
idle
hour
it
represents
a
number
of
cloak
models
doing
the
on
the
bank
of
a
purple
river
the
cablegram
said
it
might
have
been
brought
to
this
country
my
collection
will
never
be
complete
without
that
picture
well
so
long
gents
us
financiers
must
keep
early
hours
morgan
and
klein
went
away
together
in
a
cab
me
and
silver
talked
about
how
simple
and
unsuspecting
great
people
was
and
silver
said
what
a
shame
it
would
be
to
try
to
rob
a
man
like
morgan
and
i
said
i
thought
it
would
be
rather
imprudent
myself
klein
proposes
a
stroll
after
dinner
and
me
and
him
and
silver
walks
down
toward
seventh
avenue
to
see
the
sights
klein
sees
a
pair
of
cuff
links
that
instigate
his
admiration
in
a
pawnshop
window
and
we
all
go
in
while
he
buys
after
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
and
klein
had
gone
silver
jumps
at
me
and
waves
his
hands
did
you
see
it
says
he
did
you
see
it
billy
what
i
asks
why
that
picture
that
morgan
wants
it
hanging
in
that
pawnshop
behind
the
desk
i
did
say
anything
because
klein
was
there
it
the
article
sure
as
you
live
the
girls
are
as
natural
as
paint
can
make
them
all
measuring
and
and
skirts
if
they
had
any
skirts
and
they
doing
a
on
the
bank
of
a
river
with
the
blues
what
did
morgan
say
he
give
for
it
oh
do
make
me
tell
you
they
ca
know
what
it
is
in
that
pawnshop
when
the
pawnshop
opened
the
next
morning
me
and
silver
was
standing
there
as
anxious
as
if
we
wanted
to
soak
our
sunday
suit
to
buy
a
drink
we
sauntered
inside
and
began
to
look
at
that
a
violent
specimen
of
a
chromo
you
got
up
there
remarked
silver
casual
to
the
pawnbroker
but
i
kind
of
enthuse
over
the
girl
with
the
and
red
bunting
would
an
offer
of
for
it
cause
you
to
knock
over
any
fragile
articles
of
your
stock
in
hurrying
it
off
the
nail
the
pawnbroker
smiles
and
goes
on
showing
us
plate
that
picture
says
he
was
pledged
a
year
ago
by
an
italian
gentleman
i
loaned
him
on
it
it
is
called
idle
hour
and
it
is
by
leonardo
de
vinchy
two
days
ago
the
legal
time
expired
and
it
became
an
unredeemed
pledge
here
is
a
style
of
chain
that
is
worn
a
great
deal
now
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
me
and
silver
paid
the
pawnbroker
and
walked
out
with
the
picture
silver
got
into
a
cab
with
it
and
started
for
morgan
office
i
goes
to
the
hotel
and
waits
for
him
in
two
hours
silver
comes
back
did
you
see
mr
morgan
i
asks
how
much
did
he
pay
you
for
it
silver
sits
down
and
fools
with
a
tassel
on
the
table
cover
i
never
exactly
saw
morgan
he
says
because
morgan
been
in
europe
for
a
month
but
what
worrying
me
billy
is
this
the
department
stores
have
all
got
that
same
picture
on
sale
framed
for
and
they
charge
for
the
frame
alone
that
what
i
understand
iv
the
day
resurgent
i
can
see
the
artist
bite
the
end
of
his
pencil
and
frown
when
it
comes
to
drawing
his
easter
picture
for
his
legitimate
pictorial
conceptions
of
figures
pertinent
to
the
festival
are
but
four
in
number
first
comes
easter
pagan
goddess
of
spring
here
his
fancy
may
have
free
play
a
beautiful
maiden
with
decorative
hair
and
the
proper
number
of
toes
will
fill
the
bill
miss
clarice
vavasour
the
model
will
pose
for
it
in
the
lethergogallagher
or
whatever
it
was
that
trilby
called
it
second
the
melancholy
lady
with
upturned
eyes
in
a
framework
of
lilies
this
is
but
reliable
third
miss
manhattan
in
the
fifth
avenue
easter
sunday
parade
fourth
maggie
murphy
with
a
new
red
feather
in
her
old
straw
hat
happy
and
in
the
grand
street
turnout
of
course
the
rabbits
do
not
count
nor
the
easter
eggs
since
the
higher
criticism
has
them
the
limited
field
of
its
pictorial
possibilities
proves
that
easter
of
all
our
festival
days
is
the
most
vague
and
shifting
in
our
conception
it
belongs
to
all
religions
although
the
pagans
invented
it
going
back
still
further
to
the
first
spring
we
can
see
eve
choosing
with
pride
a
new
green
leaf
from
the
tree
now
the
object
of
this
critical
and
learned
preamble
is
to
set
forth
the
theorem
that
easter
is
neither
a
date
a
season
a
festival
a
holiday
nor
an
occasion
what
it
is
you
shall
find
out
if
you
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
danny
mccree
easter
sunday
dawned
as
it
should
bright
and
early
in
its
place
on
the
calendar
between
saturday
and
monday
at
the
sun
rose
and
at
danny
followed
its
example
he
went
into
the
kitchen
and
washed
his
face
at
the
sink
his
mother
was
frying
bacon
she
looked
at
his
hard
smooth
knowing
countenance
as
he
juggled
with
the
round
cake
of
soap
and
thought
of
his
father
when
she
first
saw
him
stopping
a
hot
grounder
between
second
and
third
years
before
on
a
vacant
lot
in
harlem
where
the
la
paloma
apartment
house
now
stands
in
the
front
room
of
the
flat
danny
father
sat
by
an
open
window
smoking
his
pipe
with
his
dishevelled
gray
hair
tossed
about
by
the
breeze
he
still
clung
to
his
pipe
although
his
sight
had
been
taken
from
him
two
years
before
by
a
precocious
blast
of
giant
powder
that
went
off
without
permission
very
few
blind
men
care
for
smoking
for
the
reason
that
they
can
not
see
the
smoke
now
could
you
enjoy
having
the
news
read
to
you
from
an
evening
newspaper
unless
you
could
see
the
colors
of
the
headlines
is
easter

said
mccree

danny
after

feel
it
in
the
air

danny
in
his
grumpiest
chest
tones

as
good
as

day
of
rest

team

money
for
the
rent
and
the
breakfast

that
all
right
lad
said
the
old
man
i
not
complainin
while
me
two
eyes
was
good
there
was
nothin
better
to
my
mind
than
a
sunday
out

smell
of
turf
and
burnin
brush
comin
in
the
windy
i
have
me
tobaccy
a
good
fine
day
and
rist
to
ye
lad
times
i
wish
your
mother
had
larned
to
read
so
i
might
hear
the
rest
about
the
hippopotamus
but
let
that
be
now
what
is
this
foolishness
he
talks
of
hippopotamuses
asked
danny
of
his
mother
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
have
you
been
taking
him
to
the
zoo
and
for
what
i
have
not
said
mccree
he
sets
by
the
windy
all
day
is
little
recreation
a
blind
man
among
the
poor
gets
at
all
i
they
wander
in
their
minds
at
times
one
day
he
talks
of
grease
without
stoppin
for
the
most
of
an
hour
i
looks
to
see
if
there
lard
in
the
fryin
pan
there
is
not
he
says
i
do
not
understand
is
weary
days
sundays
and
holidays
and
all
for
a
blind
man
danny
there
was
no
better
nor
stronger
than
him
when
he
had
his
two
eyes
is
a
fine
day
son
injoy
yeself
the
morning
there
will
be
cold
supper
at
six
have
you
heard
any
talk
of
a
hippopotamus
asked
danny
of
mike
the
janitor
as
he
went
out
the
door
downstairs
i
have
not
said
mike
pulling
his
shirtsleeves
higher
but
is
the
only
subject
in
the
animal
natural
and
illegal
lists
of
outrages
that
i
not
been
complained
to
about
these
two
days
see
the
landlord
or
else
move
out
if
ye
like
have
ye
hippopotamuses
in
the
lease
no
then
it
was
the
old
man
who
spoke
of
it
said
danny
likely
nothing
in
it
danny
walked
up
the
street
to
the
avenue
and
then
struck
northward
into
the
heart
of
the
district
where
easter
modern
easter
in
new
bright
raiment
leads
the
pascal
march
out
of
towering
brown
churches
came
the
blithe
music
of
anthems
from
the
choirs
the
broad
sidewalks
were
moving
parterres
of
living
flowers
so
it
seemed
when
your
eye
looked
upon
the
easter
girl
gentlemen
gardeniaed
sustained
the
background
of
the
tradition
children
carried
lilies
in
their
hands
the
windows
of
the
brownstone
mansions
were
packed
with
the
most
opulent
creations
of
flora
the
sister
of
the
lady
of
the
lilies
around
a
corner
and
tightly
buttoned
walked
corrigan
the
cop
shield
to
the
curb
danny
knew
him
why
corrigan
he
asked
is
easter
i
know
it
comes
the
first
time
you
full
after
the
moon
rises
on
the
seventeenth
of
march
but
why
is
it
a
proper
and
religious
ceremony
or
does
the
governor
appoint
it
out
of
politics
is
an
annual
celebration
said
corrigan
with
the
judicial
air
of
the
third
deputy
police
commissioner
peculiar
to
new
york
it
extends
up
to
harlem
sometimes
they
has
the
reserves
out
at
one
hundred
and
street
in
my
opinion
is
not
political
thanks
said
danny
and
say
did
you
ever
hear
a
man
complain
of
hippopotamuses
when
not
specially
in
drink
i
mean
nothing
larger
than
sea
turtles
said
corrigan
reflecting
and
there
was
wood
alcohol
in
that
danny
wandered
the
double
heavy
incumbency
of
enjoying
simultaneously
a
sunday
and
a
festival
day
was
his
the
sorrows
of
the
fit
him
easily
they
are
worn
so
often
that
they
hang
with
the
picturesque
lines
of
the
best
garments
that
is
why
artists
of
pencil
and
pen
find
in
the
griefs
of
the
common
people
their
most
striking
models
but
when
the
philistine
would
disport
himself
the
grimness
of
melpomene
herself
attends
upon
his
capers
therefore
danny
set
his
jaw
hard
at
easter
and
took
his
pleasure
sadly
the
family
entrance
of
dugan
café
was
feasible
so
danny
yielded
to
the
vernal
season
as
far
as
a
glass
of
bock
seated
in
a
dark
linoleumed
humid
back
room
his
heart
and
mind
still
groped
after
the
mysterious
meaning
of
the
springtime
jubilee
say
tim
he
said
to
the
waiter
why
do
they
have
easter
skiddoo
said
tim
closing
a
sophisticated
eye
is
that
a
new
one
all
right
tony
pastor
for
you
last
night
i
guess
i
give
it
up
what
the
answer
two
apples
or
a
yard
and
a
half
from
dugan
danny
turned
back
eastward
the
april
sun
seemed
to
stir
in
him
a
vague
feeling
that
he
could
not
construe
he
made
a
wrong
diagnosis
and
decided
that
it
was
katy
conlon
a
block
from
her
house
on
avenue
a
he
met
her
going
to
church
they
pumped
hands
on
the
corner
gee
but
you
look
dumpish
and
dressed
up
said
katy
what
wrong
come
away
with
me
to
church
and
be
cheerful
what
doing
at
church
asked
danny
why
it
easter
sunday
silly
i
waited
till
after
eleven
you
might
come
around
to
go
what
does
this
easter
stand
for
katy
asked
danny
gloomily
nobody
seems
to
know
nobody
as
blind
as
you
said
katy
with
spirit
you
have
even
looked
at
my
new
hat
and
skirt
why
it
when
all
the
girls
put
on
new
spring
clothes
silly
are
you
coming
to
church
with
me
i
will
said
danny
if
this
easter
is
pulled
off
there
they
ought
to
be
able
to
give
some
excuse
for
it
not
that
the
hat
ai
a
beauty
the
green
roses
are
great
at
church
the
preacher
did
some
expounding
with
no
pounding
he
spoke
rapidly
for
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
to
his
early
sabbath
dinner
but
he
knew
his
business
there
was
one
word
that
controlled
his
theme
resurrection
not
a
new
creation
but
a
new
life
arising
out
of
the
old
the
congregation
had
heard
it
often
before
but
there
was
a
wonderful
hat
a
combination
of
sweet
peas
and
lavender
in
the
sixth
pew
from
the
pulpit
it
attracted
much
attention
after
church
danny
lingered
on
a
corner
while
katy
waited
with
pique
in
her
eyes
are
you
coming
along
to
the
house
she
asked
but
do
mind
me
get
there
all
right
you
seem
to
be
studyin
a
lot
about
something
all
right
will
i
see
you
at
any
time
specially
mr
mccree
i
be
around
wednesday
night
as
usual
said
danny
turning
and
crossing
the
street
katy
walked
away
with
the
green
roses
dangling
indignantly
danny
stopped
two
blocks
away
he
stood
still
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
at
the
curb
on
the
corner
his
face
was
that
of
a
graven
image
deep
in
his
soul
something
stirred
so
small
so
fine
so
keen
and
leavening
that
his
hard
fibres
did
not
recognize
it
it
was
something
more
tender
than
the
april
day
more
subtle
than
the
call
of
the
senses
purer
and
than
the
love
of
woman
for
had
he
not
turned
away
from
green
roses
and
eyes
that
had
kept
him
chained
for
a
year
and
danny
did
not
know
what
it
was
the
preacher
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
his
dinner
had
told
him
but
danny
had
had
no
libretto
with
which
to
follow
the
drowsy
intonation
but
the
preacher
spoke
the
truth
suddenly
danny
slapped
his
leg
and
gave
forth
a
hoarse
yell
of
delight
hippopotamus
he
shouted
to
an
elevated
road
pillar
well
how
is
that
for
a
bum
guess
why
blast
my
skylights
i
know
what
he
was
driving
at
now
hippopotamus
would
that
send
you
to
the
bronx
it
been
a
year
since
he
heard
it
and
he
did
miss
it
so
very
far
we
quit
at
and
this
comes
next
well
a
wooden
man
would
have
guessed
what
he
was
trying
to
get
out
of
him
danny
caught
a
crosstown
car
and
went
up
to
the
rear
flat
that
his
labor
supported
old
man
mccree
was
still
sitting
by
the
window
his
extinct
pipe
lay
on
the
sill
will
that
be
you
lad
he
asked
danny
flared
into
the
rage
of
a
strong
man
who
is
surprised
at
the
outset
of
committing
a
good
deed
who
pays
the
rent
and
buys
the
food
that
is
eaten
in
this
house
he
snapped
viciously
have
i
no
right
to
come
in
ye
a
faithful
lad
said
old
man
mccree
with
a
sigh
is
it
evening
yet
danny
reached
up
on
a
shelf
and
took
down
a
thick
book
labeled
in
gilt
letters
the
history
of
greece
dust
was
on
it
half
an
inch
thick
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
found
a
place
in
it
marked
by
a
strip
of
paper
and
then
he
gave
a
short
roar
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
said
was
it
the
hippopotamus
you
wanted
to
be
read
to
about
then
did
i
hear

open
the
book
said
old
man
mccree

chair
by
the
windy

me
pipe
was
the
place
where
we
left
off
and
not
hippopotamus
said
danny
the
war
began
there
it
kept
something
doing
for
thirty
years
the
headlines
says
that
a
guy
named
philip
of
macedon
in
got
to
be
boss
of
greece
by
getting
the
decision
at
the
battle
of
i
read
it
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
rapt
in
the
peloponnesian
war
old
man
mccree
sat
for
an
hour
listening
then
he
got
up
and
felt
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
mccree
was
slicing
cold
meat
she
looked
up
tears
were
running
from
old
man
mccree
eyes
do
you
hear
our
lad
readin
to
me
he
said
there
is
none
finer
in
the
land
my
two
eyes
have
come
back
to
me
again
after
supper
he
said
to
danny

a
happy
day
this
easter
and
now
ye
will
be
off
to
see
katy
in
the
evening
well
enough
who
pays
the
rent
and
buys
the
food
that
is
eaten
in
this
house
said
danny
angrily
have
i
no
right
to
stay
in
it
after
supper
there
is
yet
to
come
the
reading
of
the
battle
of
corinth
when
the
kingdom
as
they
say
became
an
portion
of
the
roman
empire
am
i
nothing
in
this
house
v
the
fifth
wheel
the
ranks
of
the
bed
line
moved
closer
together
for
it
was
cold
they
were
alluvial
deposit
of
the
stream
of
life
lodged
in
the
delta
of
fifth
avenue
and
broadway
the
bed
liners
stamped
their
freezing
feet
looked
at
the
empty
benches
in
madison
square
whence
jack
frost
had
evicted
them
and
muttered
to
one
another
in
a
confusion
of
tongues
the
flatiron
building
with
its
impious
architecture
looming
mistily
above
them
on
the
opposite
delta
might
well
have
stood
for
the
tower
of
babel
whence
these
polyglot
idlers
had
been
called
by
the
winged
walking
delegate
of
the
lord
standing
on
a
pine
box
a
head
higher
than
his
flock
of
goats
the
preacher
exhorted
whatever
transient
and
shifting
audience
the
north
wind
doled
out
to
him
it
was
a
slave
market
fifteen
cents
bought
you
a
man
you
deeded
him
to
morpheus
and
the
recording
angel
gave
you
credit
the
preacher
was
incredibly
earnest
and
unwearied
he
had
looked
over
the
list
of
things
one
may
do
for
one
fellow
man
and
had
assumed
for
himself
the
task
of
putting
to
bed
all
who
might
apply
at
his
soap
box
on
the
nights
of
wednesday
and
sunday
that
left
but
five
nights
for
other
philanthropists
to
handle
and
had
they
done
their
part
as
well
this
wicked
city
might
have
become
a
vast
arcadian
dormitory
where
all
might
snooze
and
snore
the
happy
hours
away
letting
problem
plays
and
the
rent
man
and
business
go
to
the
deuce
the
hour
of
eight
was
but
a
little
while
past
sightseers
in
a
small
dark
mass
of
pay
ore
were
gathered
in
the
shadow
of
general
monument
now
and
then
shyly
ostentatiously
carelessly
or
with
conscientious
exactness
one
would
step
forward
and
bestow
upon
the
preacher
small
bills
or
silver
then
a
lieutenant
of
scandinavian
coloring
and
enthusiasm
would
march
away
to
a
lodging
house
with
a
squad
of
the
redeemed
all
the
while
the
preacher
exhorted
the
crowd
in
terms
beautifully
devoid
of
eloquence
splendid
with
the
deadly
accusative
monotony
of
truth
before
the
picture
of
the
bed
liners
fades
you
must
hear
one
phrase
of
the
preacher
the
one
that
formed
his
theme
that
night
it
is
worthy
of
being
stenciled
on
all
the
white
ribbons
in
the
world
no
man
ever
learned
to
be
a
drunkard
on
whisky
think
of
it
tippler
it
covers
the
ground
from
the
sprouting
rye
to
the
potter
field
a
erect
young
man
in
the
rear
rank
of
the
bedless
emulated
the
terrapin
drawing
his
head
far
down
into
the
shell
of
his
coat
collar
it
was
a
tweed
coat
and
the
trousers
still
showed
signs
of
having
flattened
themselves
beneath
the
compelling
goose
but
conscientiously
i
must
warn
the
milliner
apprentice
who
reads
this
expecting
a
reginald
montressor
in
straits
to
peruse
no
further
the
young
man
was
no
other
than
thomas
mcquade
discharged
for
drunkenness
one
month
before
and
now
reduced
to
the
grimy
ranks
of
the
bed
seekers
if
you
live
in
smaller
new
york
you
must
know
the
van
smuythe
family
carriage
drawn
by
the
two
to
bays
the
carriage
is
shaped
like
a
in
each
end
of
it
reclines
an
old
lady
van
smuythe
holding
a
black
sunshade
the
size
of
a
new
year
eve
feather
tickler
before
his
downfall
thomas
mcquade
drove
the
van
smuythe
bays
and
was
himself
driven
by
annie
the
van
smuythe
lady
maid
but
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
things
about
romance
that
a
tight
shoe
or
an
empty
commissary
or
an
aching
tooth
will
make
a
temporary
heretic
of
any
and
thomas
physical
troubles
were
not
few
therefore
his
soul
was
less
vexed
with
thoughts
of
his
lost
lady
maid
than
it
was
by
the
fancied
presence
of
certain
things
that
his
racked
nerves
almost
convinced
him
were
flying
dancing
crawling
and
wriggling
on
the
asphalt
and
in
the
air
above
and
around
the
dismal
campus
of
the
bed
line
army
nearly
four
weeks
of
straight
whisky
and
a
diet
limited
to
crackers
bologna
and
pickles
often
guarantees
a
sequel
thus
desperate
freezing
angry
beset
by
phantoms
as
he
was
he
felt
the
need
of
human
sympathy
and
intercourse
the
bed
liner
standing
at
his
right
was
a
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
shabby
but
neat
what
the
diagnosis
of
your
case
freddy
asked
thomas
with
the
freemasonic
familiarity
of
the
damned
booze
that
mine
you
look
like
a
panhandler
neither
am
i
a
month
ago
i
was
pushing
the
lines
over
the
backs
of
the
finest
team
of
percheron
buffaloes
that
ever
made
their
mile
down
fifth
avenue
in
and
look
at
me
now
say
how
do
you
come
to
be
at
this
bed
rummage
sale
the
other
young
man
seemed
to
welcome
the
advances
of
the
airy
no
said
he
mine
is
exactly
a
case
of
drink
unless
we
allow
that
cupid
is
a
bartender
i
married
unwisely
according
to
the
opinion
of
my
unforgiving
relatives
i
been
out
of
work
for
a
year
because
i
know
how
to
work
and
i
been
sick
in
bellevue
and
other
hospitals
for
months
my
wife
and
kid
had
to
go
back
to
her
mother
i
was
turned
out
of
the
hospital
yesterday
and
i
have
a
cent
that
my
tale
of
woe
tough
luck
said
thomas
a
man
alone
can
pull
through
all
right
but
i
hate
to
see
the
women
and
kids
get
the
worst
of
it
just
then
there
hummed
up
fifth
avenue
a
motor
car
so
splendid
so
red
so
smoothly
running
so
craftily
demolishing
the
speed
regulations
that
it
drew
the
attention
even
of
the
listless
bed
liners
suspended
and
pinioned
on
its
left
side
was
an
extra
tire
when
opposite
the
unfortunate
company
the
fastenings
of
this
tire
became
loosed
it
fell
to
the
asphalt
bounded
and
rolled
rapidly
in
the
wake
of
the
flying
car
thomas
mcquade
scenting
an
opportunity
darted
from
his
place
among
the
preacher
goats
in
thirty
seconds
he
had
caught
the
rolling
tire
swung
it
over
his
shoulder
and
was
trotting
smartly
after
the
car
on
both
sides
of
the
avenue
people
were
shouting
whistling
and
waving
canes
at
the
red
car
pointing
to
the
enterprising
thomas
coming
up
with
the
lost
tire
one
dollar
thomas
had
estimated
was
the
smallest
guerdon
that
so
grand
an
automobilist
could
offer
for
the
service
he
had
rendered
and
save
his
pride
two
blocks
away
the
car
had
stopped
there
was
a
little
brown
muffled
chauffeur
driving
and
an
imposing
gentleman
wearing
a
magnificent
sealskin
coat
and
a
silk
hat
on
a
rear
seat
thomas
proffered
the
captured
tire
with
his
best
manner
and
a
look
in
the
brighter
of
his
reddened
eyes
that
was
meant
to
be
suggestive
to
the
extent
of
a
silver
coin
or
two
and
receptive
up
to
higher
denominations
but
the
look
was
not
so
construed
the
sealskinned
gentleman
received
the
tire
placed
it
inside
the
car
gazed
intently
at
the
and
muttered
to
himself
inscrutable
words
strange
strange
said
he
once
or
twice
even
i
myself
have
fancied
that
the
chaldean
chiroscope
has
availed
could
it
be
possible
then
he
addressed
less
mysterious
words
to
the
waiting
and
hopeful
thomas
sir
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
rescue
of
my
tire
and
i
would
ask
you
if
i
may
a
question
do
you
know
the
family
of
van
smuythes
living
in
washington
square
north
ought
i
to
replied
thomas
i
lived
there
wish
i
did
yet
the
sealskinned
gentleman
opened
a
door
of
the
car
step
in
please
he
said
you
have
been
expected
thomas
mcquade
obeyed
with
surprise
but
without
hesitation
a
seat
in
a
motor
car
seemed
better
than
standing
room
in
the
bed
line
but
after
the
had
been
tucked
about
him
and
the
auto
had
sped
on
its
course
the
peculiarity
of
the
invitation
lingered
in
his
mind
maybe
the
guy
has
got
any
change
was
his
diagnosis
lots
of
these
swell
rounders
do
lug
about
any
ready
money
guess
he
dump
me
out
when
he
gets
to
some
joint
where
he
can
get
cash
on
his
mug
anyhow
it
a
cinch
that
i
got
that
bed
convention
beat
to
a
finish
submerged
in
his
greatcoat
the
mysterious
automobilist
seemed
himself
to
marvel
at
the
surprises
of
life
wonderful
amazing
strange
he
repeated
to
himself
constantly
when
the
car
had
well
entered
the
crosstown
seventies
it
swung
eastward
a
half
block
and
stopped
before
a
row
of
houses
be
kind
enough
to
enter
my
house
with
me
said
the
sealskinned
gentleman
when
they
had
alighted
he
going
to
dig
up
sure
reflected
thomas
following
him
inside
there
was
a
dim
light
in
the
hall
his
host
conducted
him
through
a
door
to
the
left
closing
it
after
him
and
leaving
them
in
absolute
darkness
suddenly
a
luminous
globe
strangely
decorated
shone
faintly
in
the
centre
of
an
immense
room
that
seemed
to
thomas
more
splendidly
appointed
than
any
he
had
ever
seen
on
the
stage
or
read
of
in
fairy
tales
the
walls
were
hidden
by
gorgeous
red
hangings
embroidered
with
fantastic
gold
figures
at
the
rear
end
of
the
room
were
draped
portières
of
dull
gold
spangled
with
silver
crescents
and
stars
the
furniture
was
of
the
costliest
and
rarest
styles
the
feet
sank
into
rugs
as
fleecy
and
deep
as
snowdrifts
there
were
three
or
four
oddly
shaped
stands
or
tables
covered
with
black
velvet
drapery
thomas
mcquade
took
in
the
splendors
of
this
palatial
apartment
with
one
eye
with
the
other
he
looked
for
his
imposing
conductor
to
find
that
he
had
disappeared
muttered
thomas
this
listens
like
a
spook
shop
wonder
if
it
ai
one
of
these
moravian
nights
adventures
that
you
read
about
wonder
what
became
of
the
furry
guy
suddenly
a
stuffed
owl
that
stood
on
an
ebony
perch
near
the
illuminated
globe
slowly
raised
his
wings
and
emitted
from
his
eyes
a
brilliant
electric
glow
with
a
imprecation
thomas
seized
a
bronze
statuette
of
hebe
from
a
cabinet
near
by
and
hurled
it
with
all
his
might
at
the
terrifying
and
impossible
fowl
the
owl
and
his
perch
went
over
with
a
crash
with
the
sound
there
was
a
click
and
the
room
was
flooded
with
light
from
a
dozen
frosted
globes
along
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
gold
portières
parted
and
closed
and
the
mysterious
automobilist
entered
the
room
he
was
tall
and
wore
evening
dress
of
perfect
cut
and
accurate
taste
a
vandyke
beard
of
glossy
golden
brown
rather
long
and
wavy
hair
smoothly
parted
and
large
magnetic
orientally
occult
eyes
gave
him
a
most
impressive
and
striking
appearance
if
you
can
conceive
a
russian
grand
duke
in
a
rajah
advancing
to
greet
a
visiting
emperor
you
will
gather
something
of
the
majesty
of
his
manner
but
thomas
mcquade
was
too
near
his
to
be
mindful
of
his
and
when
he
viewed
this
silken
polished
and
somewhat
terrifying
host
he
thought
vaguely
of
dentists
say
doc
said
he
resentfully
that
a
hot
bird
you
keep
on
tap
i
hope
i
did
break
anything
but
i
nearly
got
the
williwalloos
and
when
he
threw
them
lamps
of
his
on
me
i
took
a
at
him
with
that
little
brass
flatiron
girl
that
stood
on
the
sideboard
that
is
merely
a
mechanical
toy
said
the
gentleman
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
may
i
ask
you
to
be
seated
while
i
explain
why
i
brought
you
to
my
house
perhaps
you
would
not
understand
nor
be
in
sympathy
with
the
psychological
prompting
that
caused
me
to
do
so
so
i
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
by
venturing
to
refer
to
your
admission
that
you
know
the
van
smuythe
family
of
washington
square
north
any
silver
missing
asked
thomas
tartly
any
joolry
displaced
of
course
i
know
any
of
the
old
ladies
sunshades
disappeared
well
i
know
and
then
what
the
grand
duke
rubbed
his
white
hands
together
softly
wonderful
he
murmured
wonderful
shall
i
come
to
believe
in
the
chaldean
chiroscope
myself
let
me
assure
you
he
continued
that
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
fear
instead
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
very
good
fortune
awaits
you
we
will
see
do
they
want
me
back
asked
thomas
with
something
of
his
old
professional
pride
in
his
voice
i
promise
to
cut
out
the
booze
and
do
the
right
thing
if
they
try
me
again
but
how
did
you
get
wise
doc
it
the
swellest
employment
agency
i
was
ever
in
with
its
flashlight
owls
and
so
forth
with
an
indulgent
smile
the
gracious
host
begged
to
be
excused
for
two
minutes
he
went
out
to
the
sidewalk
and
gave
an
order
to
the
chauffeur
who
still
waited
with
the
car
returning
to
the
mysterious
apartment
he
sat
by
his
guest
and
began
to
entertain
him
so
well
by
his
witty
and
genial
converse
that
the
poor
bed
liner
almost
forgot
the
cold
streets
from
which
he
had
been
so
recently
and
so
singularly
rescued
a
servant
brought
some
tender
cold
fowl
and
tea
biscuits
and
a
glass
of
miraculous
wine
and
thomas
felt
the
glamour
of
arabia
envelop
him
thus
half
an
hour
sped
quickly
and
then
the
honk
of
the
returned
motor
car
at
the
door
suddenly
drew
the
grand
duke
to
his
feet
with
another
soft
petition
for
a
brief
absence
two
women
well
muffled
against
the
cold
were
admitted
at
the
front
door
and
suavely
conducted
by
the
master
of
the
house
down
the
hall
through
another
door
to
the
left
and
into
a
smaller
room
which
was
screened
and
segregated
from
the
larger
front
room
by
heavy
double
portières
here
the
furnishings
were
even
more
elegant
and
exquisitely
tasteful
than
in
the
other
on
a
rosewood
table
were
scattered
sheets
of
white
paper
and
a
queer
triangular
instrument
or
toy
apparently
of
gold
standing
on
little
wheels
the
taller
woman
threw
back
her
black
veil
and
loosened
her
cloak
she
was
fifty
with
a
wrinkled
and
sad
face
the
other
young
and
plump
took
a
chair
a
little
distance
away
and
to
the
rear
as
a
servant
or
an
attendant
might
have
done
you
sent
for
me
professor
cherubusco
said
the
elder
woman
wearily
i
hope
you
have
something
more
definite
than
usual
to
say
i
about
lost
the
little
faith
i
had
in
your
art
i
would
not
have
responded
to
your
call
this
evening
if
my
sister
had
not
insisted
upon
it
madam
said
the
professor
with
his
princeliest
smile
the
true
art
can
not
fail
to
find
the
true
psychic
and
potential
branch
sometimes
requires
time
we
have
not
succeeded
i
admit
with
the
cards
the
crystal
the
stars
the
magic
formulæ
of
zarazin
nor
the
oracle
of
po
but
we
have
at
last
discovered
the
true
psychic
route
the
chaldean
chiroscope
has
been
successful
in
our
search
the
professor
voice
had
a
ring
that
seemed
to
proclaim
his
belief
in
his
own
words
the
elderly
lady
looked
at
him
with
a
little
more
interest
why
there
was
no
sense
in
those
words
that
it
wrote
with
my
hands
on
it
she
said
what
do
you
mean
the
words
were
these
said
professor
cherubusco
rising
to
his
full
magnificent
height
the
fifth
wheel
of
the
chariot
he
shall
come
i
have
seen
many
chariots
said
the
lady
but
i
never
saw
one
with
five
wheels
progress
said
the
professor
progress
in
science
and
mechanics
has
accomplished
it
though
to
be
exact
we
may
speak
of
it
only
as
an
extra
tire
progress
in
occult
art
has
advanced
in
proportion
madam
i
repeat
that
the
chaldean
chiroscope
has
succeeded
i
can
not
only
answer
the
question
that
you
have
propounded
but
i
can
produce
before
your
eyes
the
proof
thereof
and
now
the
lady
was
disturbed
both
in
her
disbelief
and
in
her
poise
o
professor
she
cried
anxiously
when
where
has
he
been
found
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
i
beg
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
very
few
minutes
said
professor
cherubusco
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
to
you
the
efficacy
of
the
true
art
thomas
was
contentedly
munching
the
last
crumbs
of
the
bread
and
fowl
when
the
enchanter
appeared
suddenly
at
his
side
are
you
willing
to
return
to
your
old
home
if
you
are
assured
of
a
welcome
and
restoration
to
favor
he
asked
with
his
courteous
royal
smile
do
i
look
bughouse
answered
thomas
enough
of
the
footback
life
for
me
but
will
they
have
me
again
the
old
lady
is
as
fixed
in
her
ways
as
a
nut
on
a
new
axle
my
dear
young
man
said
the
other
she
has
been
searching
for
you
everywhere
great
said
thomas
i
on
the
job
that
team
of
dropsical
dromedaries
they
call
horses
is
a
handicap
for
a
coachman
like
myself
but
i
take
the
job
back
sure
doc
they
good
people
to
be
with
and
now
a
change
came
the
suave
countenance
of
the
caliph
of
bagdad
he
looked
keenly
and
suspiciously
at
the
may
i
ask
what
your
name
is
he
said
shortly
you
been
looking
for
me
said
thomas
and
do
know
my
name
you
a
funny
kind
of
sleuth
you
must
be
one
of
the
central
office
gumshoers
i
thomas
mcquade
of
course
and
i
been
chauffeur
of
the
van
smuythe
elephant
team
for
a
year
they
fired
me
a
month
ago
for
well
doc
you
saw
what
i
did
to
your
old
owl
i
went
broke
on
booze
and
when
i
saw
the
tire
drop
off
your
whiz
wagon
i
was
standing
in
that
squad
of
hoboes
at
the
worth
monument
waiting
for
a
free
bed
now
what
the
prize
for
the
best
answer
to
all
this
to
his
intense
surprise
thomas
felt
himself
lifted
by
the
collar
and
dragged
without
a
word
of
explanation
to
the
front
door
this
was
opened
and
he
was
kicked
forcibly
down
the
steps
with
one
heavy
disillusionizing
humiliating
impact
of
the
stupendous
arabian
shoe
as
soon
as
the
had
recovered
his
feet
and
his
wits
he
hastened
as
fast
as
he
could
eastward
toward
broadway
crazy
guy
was
his
estimate
of
the
mysterious
automobilist
just
wanted
to
have
some
fun
kiddin
i
guess
he
might
have
dug
up
a
dollar
anyhow
now
i
got
to
hurry
up
and
get
back
to
that
gang
of
bum
bed
hunters
before
they
all
get
preached
to
sleep
when
thomas
reached
the
end
of
his
walk
he
found
the
ranks
of
the
homeless
reduced
to
a
squad
of
perhaps
eight
or
ten
he
took
the
proper
place
of
a
newcomer
at
the
left
end
of
the
rear
rank
in
a
file
in
front
of
him
was
the
young
man
who
had
spoken
to
him
of
hospitals
and
something
of
a
wife
and
child
sorry
to
see
you
back
again
said
the
young
man
turning
to
speak
to
him
i
hoped
you
had
struck
something
better
than
this
me
said
thomas
oh
i
just
took
a
run
around
the
block
to
keep
warm
i
see
the
public
ai
lending
to
the
lord
very
fast
in
this
kind
of
weather
said
the
young
man
charity
avails
itself
of
the
proverb
and
both
begins
and
ends
at
home
and
the
preacher
and
his
vehement
lieutenant
struck
up
a
last
hymn
of
petition
to
providence
and
man
those
of
the
bed
liners
whose
windpipes
still
registered
above
degrees
hopelessly
and
tunelessly
joined
in
in
the
middle
of
the
second
verse
thomas
saw
a
sturdy
girl
with
drapery
battling
against
the
breeze
and
coming
straight
toward
him
from
the
opposite
sidewalk
annie
he
yelled
and
ran
toward
her
you
fool
you
fool
she
cried
weeping
and
laughing
and
hanging
upon
his
neck
why
did
you
do
it
the
stuff
explained
thomas
briefly
you
know
but
subsequently
nit
not
a
drop
he
led
her
to
the
curb
how
did
you
happen
to
see
me
i
came
to
find
you
said
annie
holding
tight
to
his
sleeve
oh
you
big
fool
professor
cherubusco
told
us
that
we
might
find
you
here
professor
ch
do
know
the
guy
what
saloon
does
he
work
in
he
a
clairvoyant
thomas
the
greatest
in
the
world
he
found
you
with
the
chaldean
telescope
he
said
he
a
liar
said
thomas
i
never
had
it
he
never
saw
me
have
anybody
telescope
and
he
said
you
came
in
a
chariot
with
five
wheels
or
something
annie
said
thoms
solicitously
you
giving
me
the
wheels
now
if
i
had
a
chariot
i
have
gone
to
bed
in
it
long
ago
and
without
any
singing
and
preaching
for
a
nightcap
either
listen
you
big
fool
the
missis
says
she
take
you
back
i
begged
her
to
but
you
must
behave
and
you
can
go
up
to
the
house
and
your
old
room
over
the
stable
is
ready
great
said
thomas
earnestly
you
are
it
annie
but
when
did
these
stunts
happen
at
professor
cherubusco
he
sent
his
automobile
for
the
missis
and
she
took
me
along
i
been
there
with
her
before
what
the
professor
line
he
a
clearvoyant
and
a
witch
the
missis
consults
him
he
knows
everything
but
he
has
done
the
missis
any
good
yet
though
paid
him
hundreds
of
dollars
but
he
told
us
that
the
stars
told
him
we
could
find
you
here
what
the
old
lady
want
this
to
do
that
a
family
secret
said
annie
and
now
you
asked
enough
questions
come
on
home
you
big
fool
they
had
moved
but
a
little
way
up
the
street
when
thomas
stopped
got
any
dough
with
you
annie
he
asked
annie
looked
at
him
sharply
oh
i
know
what
that
look
means
said
thomas
you
wrong
not
another
drop
but
there
a
guy
that
was
standing
next
to
me
in
the
bed
line
over
there
that
in
bad
shape
he
the
right
kind
and
he
got
wives
or
kids
or
something
and
he
on
the
sick
list
no
booze
if
you
could
dig
up
half
a
dollar
for
him
so
he
could
get
a
decent
bed
i
like
it
annie
fingers
began
to
wiggle
in
her
purse
sure
i
got
money
said
she
lots
of
it
twelve
dollars
and
then
she
added
with
woman
ineradicable
suspicion
of
vicarious
benevolence
bring
him
here
and
let
me
see
him
first
thomas
went
on
his
mission
the
wan
bed
liner
came
readily
enough
as
the
two
drew
near
annie
looked
up
from
her
purse
and
screamed
walter
oh
walter
is
that
you
annie
said
the
young
man
meekly
oh
mr
walter
and
the
missis
hunting
high
and
low
for
you
does
mother
want
to
see
me
he
asked
with
a
flush
coming
out
on
his
pale
cheek
she
been
hunting
for
you
high
and
low
sure
she
wants
to
see
you
she
wants
you
to
come
home
she
tried
police
and
morgues
and
lawyers
and
advertising
and
detectives
and
rewards
and
everything
and
then
she
took
up
clearvoyants
you
go
right
home
wo
you
mr
walter
gladly
if
she
wants
me
said
the
young
man
three
years
is
a
long
time
i
suppose
i
have
to
walk
up
though
unless
the
street
cars
are
giving
free
rides
i
used
to
walk
and
beat
that
old
plug
team
of
bays
we
used
to
drive
to
the
carriage
have
they
got
them
yet
they
have
said
thomas
feelingly
and
they
have
ten
years
from
now
the
life
of
the
royal
elephantibus
truckhorseibus
is
one
hundred
and
years
i
the
coachman
just
got
my
reappointment
five
minutes
ago
let
all
ride
up
in
a
surface
car
that
is
er
if
annie
will
pay
the
fares
on
the
broadway
car
annie
handed
each
one
of
the
prodigals
a
nickel
to
pay
the
conductor
seems
to
me
you
are
mighty
reckless
the
way
you
throw
large
sums
of
money
around
said
thomas
sarcastically
in
that
purse
said
annie
decidedly
is
exactly
i
shall
take
every
cent
of
it
and
give
it
to
professor
cherubusco
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
well
said
thomas
i
guess
he
must
be
a
pretty
fly
guy
to
pipe
off
things
the
way
he
does
i
glad
his
spooks
told
him
where
you
could
find
me
if
you
give
me
his
address
some
day
i
go
up
there
myself
and
shake
his
hand
presently
thomas
moved
tentatively
in
his
seat
and
thoughtfully
felt
an
abrasion
or
two
on
his
knees
and
his
elbows
say
annie
said
he
confidentially
maybe
it
one
of
the
last
dreams
of
booze
but
i
a
kind
of
a
recollection
of
riding
in
an
automobile
with
a
swell
guy
that
took
me
to
a
house
full
of
eagles
and
arc
lights
he
fed
me
on
biscuits
and
hot
air
and
then
kicked
me
down
the
front
steps
if
it
was
the
why
am
i
so
sore
shut
up
you
fool
said
annie
if
i
could
find
that
funny
guy
house
said
thomas
in
conclusion
i
go
up
there
some
day
and
punch
his
nose
for
him
vi
the
poet
and
the
peasant
the
other
day
a
poet
friend
of
mine
who
has
lived
in
close
communion
with
nature
all
his
life
wrote
a
poem
and
took
it
to
an
editor
it
was
a
living
pastoral
full
of
the
genuine
breath
of
the
fields
the
song
of
birds
and
the
pleasant
chatter
of
trickling
streams
when
the
poet
called
again
to
see
about
it
with
hopes
of
a
beefsteak
dinner
in
his
heart
it
was
handed
back
to
him
with
the
comment
too
artificial
several
of
us
met
over
spaghetti
and
dutchess
county
chianti
and
swallowed
indignation
with
slippery
forkfuls
and
there
we
dug
a
pit
for
the
editor
with
us
was
conant
a
writer
of
fiction
a
man
who
had
trod
on
asphalt
all
his
life
and
who
had
never
looked
upon
bucolic
scenes
except
with
sensations
of
disgust
from
the
windows
of
express
trains
conant
wrote
a
poem
and
called
it
the
doe
and
the
brook
it
was
a
fine
specimen
of
the
kind
of
work
you
would
expect
from
a
poet
who
had
strayed
with
amaryllis
only
as
far
as
the
florist
windows
and
whose
sole
ornithological
discussion
had
been
carried
on
with
a
waiter
conant
signed
this
poem
and
we
sent
it
to
the
same
editor
but
this
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
story
just
as
the
editor
was
reading
the
first
line
of
the
poem
on
the
next
morning
a
being
stumbled
off
the
west
shore
ferryboat
and
loped
slowly
up
street
the
invader
was
a
young
man
with
light
blue
eyes
a
hanging
lip
and
hair
the
exact
color
of
the
little
orphan
afterward
discovered
to
be
the
earl
daughter
in
one
of
blaney
plays
his
trousers
were
corduroy
his
coat
with
buttons
in
the
middle
of
his
back
one
bootleg
was
outside
the
corduroys
you
looked
expectantly
though
in
vain
at
his
straw
hat
for
ear
holes
its
shape
inaugurating
the
suspicion
that
it
had
been
ravaged
from
a
former
equine
possessor
in
his
hand
was
a
valise
description
of
it
is
an
impossible
task
a
boston
man
would
not
have
carried
his
lunch
and
law
books
to
his
office
in
it
and
above
one
ear
in
his
hair
was
a
wisp
of
hay
the
letter
of
credit
his
badge
of
innocence
the
last
clinging
touch
of
the
garden
of
eden
lingering
to
shame
the
men
knowingly
smilingly
the
city
crowds
passed
him
by
they
saw
the
raw
stranger
stand
in
the
gutter
and
stretch
his
neck
at
the
tall
buildings
at
this
they
ceased
to
smile
and
even
to
look
at
him
it
had
been
done
so
often
a
few
glanced
at
the
antique
valise
to
see
what
coney
attraction
or
brand
of
chewing
gum
he
might
be
thus
dinning
into
his
memory
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
ignored
even
the
newsboys
looked
bored
when
he
scampered
like
a
circus
clown
out
of
the
way
of
cabs
and
street
cars
at
eighth
avenue
stood
bunco
harry
with
his
dyed
mustache
and
shiny
eyes
harry
was
too
good
an
artist
not
to
be
pained
at
the
sight
of
an
actor
overdoing
his
part
he
edged
up
to
the
countryman
who
had
stopped
to
open
his
mouth
at
a
jewelry
store
window
and
shook
his
head
too
thick
pal
he
said
critically
too
thick
by
a
couple
of
inches
i
do
know
what
your
lay
is
but
you
got
the
properties
too
thick
that
hay
now
why
they
do
even
allow
that
on
proctor
circuit
any
more
i
do
understand
you
mister
said
the
green
one
i
not
for
any
circus
i
just
run
down
from
ulster
county
to
look
at
the
town
bein
that
the
hayin
over
with
gosh
but
it
a
whopper
i
thought
poughkeepsie
was
some
punkins
but
this
here
town
is
five
times
as
big
oh
well
said
bunco
harry
raising
his
eyebrows
i
did
mean
to
butt
in
you
do
have
to
tell
i
thought
you
ought
to
tone
down
a
little
so
i
tried
to
put
you
wise
wish
you
success
at
your
graft
whatever
it
is
come
and
have
a
drink
anyhow
i
would
mind
having
a
glass
of
lager
beer
acknowledged
the
other
they
went
to
a
café
frequented
by
men
with
smooth
faces
and
shifty
eyes
and
sat
at
their
drinks
i
glad
i
come
across
you
mister
said
haylocks
how
you
like
to
play
a
game
or
two
of
i
got
the
keerds
he
fished
them
out
of
noah
valise
a
rare
inimitable
deck
greasy
with
bacon
suppers
and
grimy
with
the
soil
of
cornfields
bunco
harry
laughed
loud
and
briefly
not
for
me
sport
he
said
firmly
i
do
go
against
that
of
yours
for
a
cent
but
i
still
say
you
overdone
it
the
reubs
have
dressed
like
that
since
i
doubt
if
you
could
work
brooklyn
for
a
watch
with
that
layout
oh
you
need
think
i
ai
got
the
money
boasted
haylocks
he
drew
forth
a
tightly
rolled
mass
of
bills
as
large
as
a
teacup
and
laid
it
on
the
table
got
that
for
my
share
of
grandmother
farm
he
announced
in
that
roll
thought
i
come
to
the
city
and
look
around
for
a
likely
business
to
go
into
bunco
harry
took
up
the
roll
of
money
and
looked
at
it
with
almost
respect
in
his
smiling
eyes
i
seen
worse
he
said
critically
but
you
never
do
it
in
them
clothes
you
want
to
get
light
tan
shoes
and
a
black
suit
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
colored
band
and
talk
a
good
deal
about
pittsburg
and
freight
differentials
and
drink
sherry
for
breakfast
in
order
to
work
off
phony
stuff
like
that
what
his
line
asked
two
or
three
men
of
bunco
harry
after
haylocks
had
gathered
up
his
impugned
money
and
departed
the
queer
i
guess
said
harry
or
else
he
one
of
jerome
men
or
some
guy
with
a
new
graft
he
too
much
hayseed
maybe
that
his
i
wonder
now
oh
no
it
could
have
been
real
money
haylocks
wandered
on
thirst
probably
assailed
him
again
for
he
dived
into
a
dark
groggery
on
a
side
street
and
bought
beer
at
first
sight
of
him
their
eyes
brightened
but
when
his
insistent
and
exaggerated
rusticity
became
apparent
their
expressions
changed
to
wary
suspicion
haylocks
swung
his
valise
across
the
bar
keep
that
a
while
for
me
mister
he
said
chewing
at
the
end
of
a
virulent
claybank
cigar
i
be
back
after
i
knock
around
a
spell
and
keep
your
eye
on
it
for
there
inside
of
it
though
maybe
you
would
think
so
to
look
at
me
somewhere
outside
a
phonograph
struck
up
a
band
piece
and
haylocks
was
off
for
it
his
buttons
flopping
in
the
middle
of
his
back
divvy
mike
said
the
men
hanging
upon
the
bar
winking
openly
at
one
another
honest
now
said
the
bartender
kicking
the
valise
to
one
side
you
do
think
i
fall
to
that
do
you
anybody
can
see
he
ai
no
jay
one
of
mcadoo
squad
i
guess
he
a
shine
if
he
made
himself
up
there
ai
no
parts
of
the
country
now
where
they
dress
like
that
since
they
run
rural
free
delivery
to
providence
rhode
island
if
got
in
that
valise
it
a
cent
waterbury
stopped
at
ten
minutes
to
ten
when
haylocks
had
exhausted
the
resources
of
edison
to
amuse
he
returned
for
his
valise
and
then
down
broadway
he
gallivanted
culling
the
sights
with
his
eager
blue
eyes
but
still
and
evermore
broadway
rejected
him
with
curt
glances
and
sardonic
smiles
he
was
the
oldest
of
the
gags
that
the
city
must
endure
he
was
so
flagrantly
impossible
so
ultra
rustic
so
exaggerated
beyond
the
most
freakish
products
of
the
barnyard
the
hayfield
and
the
vaudeville
stage
that
he
excited
only
weariness
and
suspicion
and
the
wisp
of
hay
in
his
hair
was
so
genuine
so
fresh
and
redolent
of
the
meadows
so
clamorously
rural
that
even
a
man
would
have
put
up
his
peas
and
folded
his
table
at
the
sight
of
it
haylocks
seated
himself
upon
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
once
more
exhumed
his
roll
of
from
the
valise
the
outer
one
a
twenty
he
shucked
off
and
beckoned
to
a
newsboy
son
said
he
run
somewhere
and
get
this
changed
for
me
i
mighty
nigh
out
of
chicken
feed
i
guess
you
get
a
nickel
if
you
hurry
up
a
hurt
look
appeared
through
the
dirt
on
the
newsy
face
aw
and
get
yer
funny
bill
changed
yerself
dey
ai
no
farm
clothes
yer
got
on
wit
yer
stage
money
on
a
corner
lounged
a
steerer
for
a
he
saw
haylocks
and
his
expression
suddenly
grew
cold
and
virtuous
mister
said
the
rural
one
i
heard
of
places
in
this
here
town
where
a
fellow
could
have
a
good
game
of
old
sledge
or
peg
a
card
at
keno
i
got
in
this
valise
and
i
come
down
from
old
ulster
to
see
the
sights
know
where
a
fellow
could
get
action
on
about
or
goin
to
have
some
sport
and
then
maybe
i
buy
out
a
business
of
some
kind
the
steerer
looked
pained
and
investigated
a
white
speck
on
his
left
forefinger
nail
cheese
it
old
man
he
murmured
reproachfully
the
central
office
must
be
bughouse
to
send
you
out
looking
like
such
a
gillie
you
could
get
within
two
blocks
of
a
sidewalk
crap
game
in
them
tony
pastor
props
the
recent
scotty
from
death
valley
has
got
you
beat
a
crosstown
block
in
the
way
of
elizabethan
scenery
and
mechanical
accessories
let
it
be
skiddoo
for
yours
nay
i
know
of
no
gilded
halls
where
one
may
bet
a
patrol
wagon
on
the
ace
rebuffed
once
again
by
the
great
city
that
is
so
swift
to
detect
artificialities
haylocks
sat
upon
the
curb
and
presented
his
thoughts
to
hold
a
conference
it
my
clothes
said
he
durned
if
it
ai
they
think
i
a
hayseed
and
wo
have
nothin
to
do
with
me
nobody
never
made
fun
of
this
hat
in
ulster
county
i
guess
if
you
want
folks
to
notice
you
in
new
york
you
must
dress
up
like
they
do
so
haylocks
went
shopping
in
the
bazaars
where
men
spake
through
their
noses
and
rubbed
their
hands
and
ran
the
tape
line
ecstatically
over
the
bulge
in
his
inside
pocket
where
reposed
a
red
nubbin
of
corn
with
an
even
number
of
rows
and
messengers
bearing
parcels
and
boxes
streamed
to
his
hotel
on
broadway
within
the
lights
of
long
acre
at
in
the
evening
one
descended
to
the
sidewalk
whom
ulster
county
would
have
foresworn
bright
tan
were
his
shoes
his
hat
the
latest
block
his
light
gray
trousers
were
deeply
creased
a
gay
blue
silk
handkerchief
flapped
from
the
breast
pocket
of
his
elegant
english
walking
coat
his
collar
might
have
graced
a
laundry
window
his
blond
hair
was
trimmed
close
the
wisp
of
hay
was
gone
for
an
instant
he
stood
resplendent
with
the
leisurely
air
of
a
boulevardier
concocting
in
his
mind
the
route
for
his
evening
pleasures
and
then
he
turned
down
the
gay
bright
street
with
the
easy
and
graceful
tread
of
a
millionaire
but
in
the
instant
that
he
had
paused
the
wisest
and
keenest
eyes
in
the
city
had
enveloped
him
in
their
field
of
vision
a
stout
man
with
gray
eyes
picked
two
of
his
friends
with
a
lift
of
his
eyebrows
from
the
row
of
loungers
in
front
of
the
hotel
the
juiciest
jay
i
seen
in
six
months
said
the
man
with
gray
eyes
come
along
it
was
eleven
when
a
man
galloped
into
the
west
street
police
station
with
the
story
of
his
wrongs
nine
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
he
gasped
all
my
share
of
grandmother
farm
the
desk
sergeant
wrung
from
him
the
name
jabez
bulltongue
of
locust
valley
farm
ulster
county
and
then
began
to
take
descriptions
of
the
gentlemen
when
conant
went
to
see
the
editor
about
the
fate
of
his
poem
he
was
received
over
the
head
of
the
office
boy
into
the
inner
office
that
is
decorated
with
the
statuettes
by
rodin
and
brown
when
i
read
the
first
line
of
doe
and
the
brook
said
the
editor
i
knew
it
to
be
the
work
of
one
whose
life
has
been
heart
to
heart
with
nature
the
finished
art
of
the
line
did
not
blind
me
to
that
fact
to
use
a
somewhat
homely
comparison
it
was
as
if
a
wild
free
child
of
the
woods
and
fields
were
to
don
the
garb
of
fashion
and
walk
down
broadway
beneath
the
apparel
the
man
would
show
thanks
said
conant
i
suppose
the
check
will
be
round
on
thursday
as
usual
the
morals
of
this
story
have
somehow
gotten
mixed
you
can
take
your
choice
of
stay
on
the
farm
or
do
write
poetry
vii
the
robe
of
peace
mysteries
follow
one
another
so
closely
in
a
great
city
that
the
reading
public
and
the
friends
of
johnny
bellchambers
have
ceased
to
marvel
at
his
sudden
and
unexplained
disappearance
nearly
a
year
ago
this
particular
mystery
has
now
been
cleared
up
but
the
solution
is
so
strange
and
incredible
to
the
mind
of
the
average
man
that
only
a
select
few
who
were
in
close
touch
with
bellchambers
will
give
it
full
credence
johnny
bellchambers
as
is
well
known
belonged
to
the
intrinsically
inner
circle
of
the
without
any
of
the
ostentation
of
the
fashionable
ones
who
endeavor
to
attract
notice
by
eccentric
display
of
wealth
and
show
he
still
was
in
everything
that
gave
deserved
lustre
to
his
high
position
in
the
ranks
of
society
especially
did
he
shine
in
the
matter
of
dress
in
this
he
was
the
despair
of
imitators
always
correct
exquisitely
groomed
and
possessed
of
an
unlimited
wardrobe
he
was
conceded
to
be
the
man
in
new
york
and
therefore
in
america
there
was
not
a
tailor
in
gotham
who
would
not
have
deemed
it
a
precious
boon
to
have
been
granted
the
privilege
of
making
bellchambers
clothes
without
a
cent
of
pay
as
he
wore
them
they
would
have
been
a
priceless
advertisement
trousers
were
his
especial
passion
here
nothing
but
perfection
would
he
notice
he
would
have
worn
a
patch
as
quickly
as
he
would
have
overlooked
a
wrinkle
he
kept
a
man
in
his
apartments
always
busy
pressing
his
ample
supply
his
friends
said
that
three
hours
was
the
limit
of
time
that
he
would
wear
these
garments
without
exchanging
bellchambers
disappeared
very
suddenly
for
three
days
his
absence
brought
no
alarm
to
his
friends
and
then
they
began
to
operate
the
usual
methods
of
inquiry
all
of
them
failed
he
had
left
absolutely
no
trace
behind
then
the
search
for
a
motive
was
instituted
but
none
was
found
he
had
no
enemies
he
had
no
debts
there
was
no
woman
there
were
several
thousand
dollars
in
his
bank
to
his
credit
he
had
never
showed
any
tendency
toward
mental
eccentricity
in
fact
he
was
of
a
particularly
calm
and
temperament
every
means
of
tracing
the
vanished
man
was
made
use
of
but
without
avail
it
was
one
of
those
cases
more
numerous
in
late
years
where
men
seem
to
have
gone
out
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
leaving
not
even
a
trail
of
smoke
as
a
witness
in
may
tom
eyres
and
lancelot
gilliam
two
of
bellchambers
old
friends
went
for
a
little
run
on
the
other
side
while
pottering
around
in
italy
and
switzerland
they
happened
one
day
to
hear
of
a
monastery
in
the
swiss
alps
that
promised
something
outside
of
the
ordinary
attractions
the
monastery
was
almost
inaccessible
to
the
average
sightseer
being
on
an
extremely
rugged
and
precipitous
spur
of
the
mountains
the
attractions
it
possessed
but
did
not
advertise
were
first
an
exclusive
and
divine
cordial
made
by
the
monks
that
was
said
to
far
surpass
benedictine
and
chartreuse
next
a
huge
brass
bell
so
purely
and
accurately
cast
that
it
had
not
ceased
sounding
since
it
was
first
rung
three
hundred
years
ago
finally
it
was
asserted
that
no
englishman
had
ever
set
foot
within
its
walls
eyres
and
gilliam
decided
that
these
three
reports
called
for
investigation
it
took
them
two
days
with
the
aid
of
two
guides
to
reach
the
monastery
of
gondrau
it
stood
upon
a
frozen
crag
with
the
snow
piled
about
it
in
treacherous
drifting
masses
they
were
hospitably
received
by
the
brothers
whose
duty
it
was
to
entertain
the
infrequent
guest
they
drank
of
the
precious
cordial
finding
it
rarely
potent
and
reviving
they
listened
to
the
great
bell
and
learned
that
they
were
pioneer
travelers
in
those
gray
stone
walls
over
the
englishman
whose
restless
feet
have
trodden
nearly
every
corner
of
the
earth
at
three
on
the
afternoon
they
arrived
the
two
young
gothamites
stood
with
good
brother
cristofer
in
the
great
cold
hallway
of
the
monastery
to
watch
the
monks
march
past
on
their
way
to
the
refectory
they
came
slowly
pacing
by
twos
with
their
heads
bowed
treading
noiselessly
with
sandaled
feet
upon
the
rough
stone
flags
as
the
procession
slowly
filed
past
eyres
suddenly
gripped
gilliam
by
the
arm
look
he
whispered
eagerly
at
the
one
just
opposite
you
now
the
one
on
this
side
with
his
hand
at
his
waist
if
that
is
johnny
bellchambers
then
i
never
saw
him
gilliam
saw
and
recognized
the
lost
glass
of
fashion
what
the
deuce
said
he
wonderingly
is
old
bell
doing
here
tommy
it
surely
ca
be
he
never
heard
of
bell
having
a
turn
for
the
religious
fact
is
i
heard
him
say
things
when
a
seem
to
tie
up
just
right
that
would
bring
him
up
for
before
any
church
it
bell
without
a
doubt
said
eyres
firmly
or
i
pretty
badly
in
need
of
an
oculist
but
think
of
johnny
bellchambers
the
royal
high
chancellor
of
swell
togs
and
the
mahatma
of
pink
teas
up
here
in
cold
storage
doing
penance
in
a
bathrobe
i
ca
get
it
straight
in
my
mind
let
ask
the
jolly
old
boy
that
doing
the
honors
brother
cristofer
was
appealed
to
for
information
by
that
time
the
monks
had
passed
into
the
refectory
he
could
not
tell
to
which
one
they
referred
bellchambers
ah
the
brothers
of
gondrau
abandoned
their
worldly
names
when
they
took
the
vows
did
the
gentlemen
wish
to
speak
with
one
of
the
brothers
if
they
would
come
to
the
refectory
and
indicate
the
one
they
wished
to
see
the
reverend
abbot
in
authority
would
doubtless
permit
it
eyres
and
gilliam
went
into
the
dining
hall
and
pointed
out
to
brother
cristofer
the
man
they
had
seen
yes
it
was
johnny
bellchambers
they
saw
his
face
plainly
now
as
he
sat
among
the
dingy
brothers
never
looking
up
eating
broth
from
a
coarse
brown
bowl
permission
to
speak
to
one
of
the
brothers
was
granted
to
the
two
travelers
by
the
abbot
and
they
waited
in
a
reception
room
for
him
to
come
when
he
did
come
treading
softly
in
his
sandals
both
eyres
and
gilliam
looked
at
him
in
perplexity
and
astonishment
it
was
johnny
bellchambers
but
he
had
a
different
look
upon
his
face
was
an
expression
of
ineffable
peace
of
rapturous
attainment
of
perfect
and
complete
happiness
his
form
was
proudly
erect
his
eyes
shone
with
a
serene
and
gracious
light
he
was
as
neat
and
as
in
the
old
new
york
days
but
how
differently
was
he
clad
now
he
seemed
clothed
in
but
a
single
garment
a
long
robe
of
rough
brown
cloth
gathered
by
a
cord
at
the
waist
and
falling
in
straight
loose
folds
nearly
to
his
feet
he
shook
hands
with
his
visitors
with
his
old
ease
and
grace
of
manner
if
there
was
any
embarrassment
in
that
meeting
it
was
not
manifested
by
johnny
bellchambers
the
room
had
no
seats
they
stood
to
converse
glad
to
see
you
old
man
said
eyres
somewhat
awkwardly
expecting
to
find
you
up
here
not
a
bad
idea
though
after
all
society
an
awful
sham
must
be
a
relief
to
shake
the
giddy
whirl
and
retire
to
er
contemplation
and
er
prayer
and
hymns
and
those
things
oh
cut
that
tommy
said
bellchambers
cheerfully
do
be
afraid
that
i
pass
around
the
plate
i
go
through
these
with
the
rest
of
these
old
boys
because
they
are
the
rules
i
brother
ambrose
here
you
know
i
given
just
ten
minutes
to
talk
to
you
fellows
that
rather
a
new
design
in
waistcoats
you
have
on
is
it
gilliam
are
they
wearing
those
things
on
broadway
now
it
the
same
old
johnny
said
gilliam
joyfully
what
the
devil
i
mean
why
oh
confound
it
what
did
you
do
it
for
old
man
peel
the
bathrobe
pleaded
eyres
almost
tearfully
and
go
back
with
us
the
old
crowd
go
wild
to
see
you
this
is
in
your
line
bell
i
know
half
a
dozen
girls
that
wore
the
willow
on
the
quiet
when
you
shook
us
in
that
unaccountable
way
hand
in
your
resignation
or
get
a
dispensation
or
whatever
you
have
to
do
to
get
a
release
from
this
ice
factory
you
get
catarrh
here
johnny
and
my
god
you
have
any
socks
on
bellchambers
looked
down
at
his
sandaled
feet
and
smiled
you
fellows
do
understand
he
said
soothingly
it
nice
of
you
to
want
me
to
go
back
but
the
old
life
will
never
know
me
again
i
have
reached
here
the
goal
of
all
my
ambitions
i
am
entirely
happy
and
contented
here
i
shall
remain
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
you
see
this
robe
that
i
wear
bellchambers
caressingly
touched
the
garment
at
last
i
have
found
something
that
will
not
bag
at
the
knees
i
have
attained
at
that
moment
the
deep
boom
of
the
great
brass
bell
reverberated
through
the
monastery
it
must
have
been
a
summons
to
immediate
devotions
for
brother
ambrose
bowed
his
head
turned
and
left
the
chamber
without
another
word
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
as
he
passed
through
the
stone
doorway
seemed
to
say
a
farewell
to
his
old
friends
they
left
the
monastery
without
seeing
him
again
and
this
is
the
story
that
tommy
eyres
and
lancelot
gilliam
brought
back
with
them
from
their
latest
european
tour
viii
the
girl
and
the
graft
the
other
day
i
ran
across
my
old
friend
ferguson
pogue
pogue
is
a
conscientious
grafter
of
the
highest
type
his
headquarters
is
the
western
hemisphere
and
his
line
of
business
is
anything
from
speculating
in
town
lots
on
the
great
staked
plains
to
selling
wooden
toys
in
connecticut
made
by
hydraulic
pressure
from
nutmegs
ground
to
a
pulp
now
and
then
when
pogue
has
made
a
good
haul
he
comes
to
new
york
for
a
rest
he
says
the
jug
of
wine
and
loaf
of
bread
and
thou
in
the
wilderness
business
is
about
as
much
rest
and
pleasure
to
him
as
sliding
down
the
bumps
at
coney
would
be
to
president
taft
give
me
says
pogue
a
big
city
for
my
vacation
especially
new
york
i
not
much
fond
of
new
yorkers
and
manhattan
is
about
the
only
place
on
the
globe
where
i
do
find
any
while
in
the
metropolis
pogue
can
always
be
found
at
one
of
two
places
one
is
a
little
on
fourth
avenue
where
he
reads
books
about
his
hobbies
mahometanism
and
taxidermy
i
found
him
at
the
other
his
hall
bedroom
in
eighteenth
street
where
he
sat
in
his
stocking
feet
trying
to
pluck
the
banks
of
the
wabash
out
of
a
small
zither
four
years
he
has
practised
this
tune
without
arriving
near
enough
to
cast
the
longest
trout
line
to
the
water
edge
on
the
dresser
lay
a
colt
and
a
tight
roll
of
tens
and
twenties
large
enough
around
to
belong
to
the
spring
class
a
chambermaid
with
a
air
fluttered
nearby
in
the
hall
unable
to
enter
or
to
flee
scandalized
by
the
stocking
feet
aghast
at
the
colt
yet
powerless
with
her
metropolitan
instincts
to
remove
herself
beyond
the
magic
influence
of
the
roll
i
sat
on
his
trunk
while
ferguson
pogue
talked
no
one
could
be
franker
or
more
candid
in
his
conversation
beside
his
expression
the
cry
of
henry
james
for
lacteal
nourishment
at
the
age
of
one
month
would
have
seemed
like
a
chaldean
cryptogram
he
told
me
stories
of
his
profession
with
pride
for
he
considered
it
an
art
and
i
was
curious
enough
to
ask
him
whether
he
had
known
any
women
who
followed
it
ladies
said
pogue
with
western
chivalry
well
not
to
any
great
extent
they
do
amount
to
much
in
special
lines
of
graft
because
they
all
so
busy
in
general
lines
what
why
they
have
to
who
got
the
money
in
the
world
the
men
did
you
ever
know
a
man
to
give
a
woman
a
dollar
without
any
consideration
a
man
will
shell
out
his
dust
to
another
man
free
and
easy
and
gratis
but
if
he
drops
a
penny
in
one
of
the
machines
run
by
the
madam
eve
daughters
amalgamated
association
and
the
pineapple
chewing
gum
do
fall
out
when
he
pulls
the
lever
you
can
hear
him
kick
to
the
superintendent
four
blocks
away
man
is
the
hardest
proposition
a
woman
has
to
go
up
against
he
the
one
and
she
has
to
work
overtime
to
make
him
pay
two
times
out
of
five
she
salted
she
ca
put
in
crushers
and
costly
machinery
notice
and
be
onto
the
game
they
have
to
pan
out
what
they
get
and
it
hurts
their
tender
hands
some
of
are
natural
sluice
troughs
and
can
carry
out
to
the
ton
the
ones
have
to
depend
on
signed
letters
false
hair
sympathy
the
kangaroo
walk
cowhide
whips
ability
to
cook
sentimental
juries
conversational
powers
silk
underskirts
ancestry
rouge
anonymous
letters
violet
sachet
powders
witnesses
revolvers
pneumatic
forms
carbolic
acid
moonlight
cold
cream
and
the
evening
newspapers
you
are
outrageous
ferg
i
said
surely
there
is
none
of
this
as
you
call
it
in
a
perfect
and
harmonious
matrimonial
union
well
said
pogue
nothing
that
would
justify
you
every
time
in
calling
police
headquarters
and
ordering
out
the
reserves
and
a
vaudeville
manager
on
a
dead
run
but
it
this
way
suppose
you
a
fifth
avenue
millionaire
soaring
high
on
the
right
side
of
copper
and
cappers
you
come
home
at
night
and
bring
a
diamond
brooch
to
the
lady
who
staked
you
for
a
claim
you
hand
it
over
she
says
george
and
looks
to
see
if
it
backed
she
comes
up
and
kisses
you
you
waited
for
it
you
get
it
all
right
it
graft
but
i
telling
you
about
artemisia
blye
she
was
from
kansas
and
she
suggested
corn
in
all
of
its
phases
her
hair
was
as
yellow
as
the
silk
her
form
was
as
tall
and
graceful
as
a
stalk
in
the
low
grounds
during
a
wet
summer
her
eyes
were
as
big
and
startling
as
bunions
and
green
was
her
favorite
color
on
my
last
trip
into
the
cool
recesses
of
your
sequestered
city
i
met
a
human
named
vaucross
he
was
worth
that
is
he
had
a
million
he
told
me
he
was
in
business
on
the
street
sidewalk
merchant
says
i
sarcastic
says
he
partner
of
a
paving
concern
i
kind
of
took
to
him
for
this
reason
i
met
him
on
broadway
one
night
when
i
was
out
of
heart
luck
tobacco
and
place
he
was
all
silk
hat
diamonds
and
front
he
was
all
front
if
you
had
gone
behind
him
you
would
have
only
looked
yourself
in
the
face
i
looked
like
a
cross
between
count
tolstoy
and
a
june
lobster
i
was
out
of
luck
i
had
but
let
me
lay
my
eyes
on
that
dealer
again
vaucross
stopped
and
talked
to
me
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
took
me
to
a
restaurant
to
eat
dinner
there
was
music
and
then
some
beethoven
and
bordelaise
sauce
and
cussing
in
french
and
frangipangi
and
some
hauteur
and
cigarettes
when
i
am
flush
i
know
them
places
i
declare
i
must
have
looked
as
bad
as
a
magazine
artist
sitting
there
without
any
money
and
my
hair
all
rumpled
like
i
was
booked
to
read
a
chapter
from
school
days
at
a
brooklyn
bohemian
smoker
but
vaucross
treated
me
like
a
bear
hunter
guide
he
was
afraid
of
hurting
the
waiter
feelings
pogue
he
explains
to
me
am
using
you
on
says
i
hope
you
do
wake
up
and
then
he
tells
me
you
know
the
kind
of
man
he
was
he
was
a
new
yorker
his
whole
ambition
was
to
be
noticed
he
wanted
to
be
conspicuous
he
wanted
people
to
point
him
out
and
bow
to
him
and
tell
others
who
he
was
he
said
it
had
been
the
desire
of
his
life
always
he
did
have
but
a
million
so
he
could
attract
attention
by
spending
money
he
said
he
tried
to
get
into
public
notice
one
time
by
planting
a
little
public
square
on
the
east
side
with
garlic
for
free
use
of
the
poor
but
carnegie
heard
of
it
and
covered
it
over
at
once
with
a
library
in
the
gaelic
language
three
times
he
had
jumped
in
the
way
of
automobiles
but
the
only
result
was
five
broken
ribs
and
a
notice
in
the
papers
that
an
unknown
man
five
feet
ten
with
four
teeth
supposed
to
be
the
last
of
the
famous
red
leary
gang
had
been
run
over
try
the
reporters
i
asked
him
month
says
vaucross
expenditure
for
lunches
to
reporters
was
anything
out
of
that
i
asks
reminds
me
says
he
for
pepsin
yes
i
got
indigestion
am
i
supposed
to
push
along
your
scramble
for
prominence
i
inquires
of
that
sort
says
vaucross
grieves
me
but
i
am
forced
to
resort
to
eccentricity
and
here
he
drops
his
napkin
in
his
soup
and
rises
up
and
bows
to
a
gent
who
is
devastating
a
potato
under
a
palm
across
the
room
police
commissioner
says
my
climber
gratified
says
i
in
a
hurry
ambitions
but
do
kick
a
rung
out
of
your
ladder
when
you
use
me
as
a
stepping
stone
to
salute
the
police
you
spoil
my
appetite
on
the
grounds
that
i
may
be
degraded
and
incriminated
be
thoughtful
at
the
quaker
city
squab
en
casserole
the
idea
about
artemisia
blye
comes
to
me
i
can
manage
to
get
you
in
the
papers
says
i
column
or
two
every
day
in
all
of
and
your
picture
in
most
of
for
a
week
how
much
would
it
be
worth
to
you
thousand
dollars
says
vaucross
warm
in
a
minute
no
murder
says
he
i
wo
wear
pink
pants
at
a
cotillon
would
ask
you
to
says
i
is
honorable
stylish
and
uneffeminate
tell
the
waiter
to
bring
a
demi
tasse
and
some
other
beans
and
i
will
disclose
to
you
the
opus
moderandi
we
closed
the
deal
an
hour
later
in
the
rococo
rouge
et
noise
room
i
telegraphed
that
night
to
miss
artemisia
in
salina
she
took
a
couple
of
photographs
and
an
autograph
letter
to
an
elder
in
the
fourth
presbyterian
church
in
the
morning
and
got
some
transportation
and
she
stopped
in
topeka
long
enough
to
trade
a
flashlight
interior
and
a
valentine
to
the
of
a
trust
company
for
a
mileage
book
and
a
package
of
notes
with
scrawled
on
the
band
the
fifth
evening
after
she
got
my
wire
she
was
waiting
all
décolletée
and
dressed
up
for
me
and
vaucross
to
take
her
to
dinner
in
one
of
these
new
york
feminine
apartment
houses
where
a
man
ca
get
in
unless
he
plays
bezique
and
smokes
depilatory
powder
cigarettes
a
stunner
says
vaucross
when
he
saw
her
give
her
a
cut
sure
this
was
the
scheme
the
three
of
us
concocted
it
was
business
straight
through
vaucross
was
to
rush
miss
blye
with
all
the
style
and
display
and
emotion
he
could
for
a
month
of
course
that
amounted
to
nothing
as
far
as
his
ambitions
were
concerned
the
sight
of
a
man
in
a
white
tie
and
patent
leather
pumps
pouring
greenbacks
through
the
large
end
of
a
cornucopia
to
purchase
nutriment
and
heartsease
for
tall
willowy
blondes
in
new
york
is
as
common
a
sight
as
blue
turtles
in
delirium
tremens
but
he
was
to
write
her
love
letters
the
worst
kind
of
love
letters
such
as
your
wife
publishes
after
you
are
dead
every
day
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
was
to
drop
her
and
she
would
bring
suit
for
for
breach
of
promise
miss
artemisia
was
to
get
if
she
won
the
suit
that
was
all
and
if
she
lost
she
was
to
get
it
anyhow
there
was
a
signed
contract
to
that
effect
sometimes
they
had
me
out
with
but
not
often
i
could
keep
up
to
their
style
she
used
to
pull
out
his
notes
and
criticize
them
like
bills
of
lading
you
she
say
do
you
call
this
letter
to
a
hardware
merchant
from
his
nephew
on
learning
that
his
aunt
has
nettlerash
you
eastern
duffers
know
as
much
about
writing
love
letters
as
a
kansas
grasshopper
does
about
tugboats
my
dear
miss
blye
would
that
put
pink
icing
and
a

on
your
bridal
cake
how
long
do
you
expect
to
hold
an
audience
in
a
with
that
kind
of
stuff
you
want
to
get
down
to
business
and
call
me

yourself

you
want

after
that
vaucross
dipped
his
pen
in
the
indelible
tabasco
his
notes
read
like
something
or
other
in
the
original
i
could
see
a
jury
sitting
up
and
women
tearing
one
another
hats
to
hear
read
and
i
could
see
piling
up
for
vaucross
as
much
notoriousness
as
archbishop
cranmer
or
the
brooklyn
bridge
or
ever
enjoyed
he
seemed
mighty
pleased
at
the
prospects
they
agreed
on
a
night
and
i
stood
on
fifth
avenue
outside
a
solemn
restaurant
and
watched
a
walked
in
and
handed
vaucross
the
papers
at
his
table
everybody
looked
at
and
he
looked
as
proud
as
cicero
i
went
back
to
my
room
and
lit
a
cigar
for
i
knew
the
was
as
good
as
ours
about
two
hours
later
somebody
knocked
at
my
door
there
stood
vaucross
and
miss
artemisia
and
she
was
clinging
yes
sir
clinging
to
his
arm
and
they
tells
me
they
been
out
and
got
married
and
they
articulated
some
trivial
cadences
about
love
and
such
and
they
laid
down
a
bundle
on
the
table
and
said
night
and
left
and
that
why
i
say
concluded
ferguson
pogue
that
a
woman
is
too
busy
occupied
with
her
natural
vocation
and
instinct
of
graft
such
as
is
given
her
for
and
amusement
to
make
any
great
success
in
special
lines
what
was
in
the
bundle
that
they
left
i
asked
with
my
usual
curiosity
why
said
ferguson
there
was
a
scalper
railroad
ticket
as
far
as
kansas
city
and
two
pairs
of
vaucross
old
pants
ix
the
call
of
the
tame
when
the
inauguration
was
accomplished
the
proceedings
were
made
smooth
by
the
presence
of
the
rough
riders
it
is
well
known
that
a
herd
of
those
competent
and
loyal
paid
a
visit
to
the
big
city
the
newspaper
reporters
dug
out
of
their
trunks
the
old
hats
and
leather
belts
that
they
wear
to
north
beach
fish
fries
and
mixed
with
the
visitors
no
damage
was
done
beyond
the
employment
of
the
wonderful
plural
tenderfeet
in
each
of
the
scribe
stories
the
westerners
mildly
contemplated
the
skyscrapers
as
high
as
the
third
story
yawned
at
broadway
hunched
down
in
the
big
chairs
in
hotel
corridors
and
altogether
looked
as
bored
and
dejected
as
a
member
of
ye
ancient
and
honorable
artillery
separated
during
a
sham
battle
from
his
valet
out
of
this
sightseeing
delegations
of
good
king
teddy
gentlemen
of
the
royal
dropped
one
greenbrier
nye
of
pin
feather
ariz
the
daily
cyclone
of
sixth
avenue
rush
hour
swept
him
away
from
the
company
of
his
pardners
true
the
dust
from
a
thousand
rustling
skirts
filled
his
eyes
the
mighty
roar
of
trains
rushing
across
the
sky
deafened
him
the
of
twice
ten
hundred
beaming
eyes
confused
his
vision
the
storm
was
so
sudden
and
tremendous
that
greenbrier
first
impulse
was
to
lie
down
and
grab
a
root
and
then
he
remembered
that
the
disturbance
was
human
and
not
elemental
and
he
backed
out
of
it
with
a
grin
into
a
doorway
the
reporters
had
written
that
but
for
the
hats
the
west
was
not
visible
upon
these
gauchos
of
the
north
heaven
sharpen
their
eyes
the
suit
of
black
diagonal
wrinkled
in
impossible
places
the
bright
blue
factory
tied
the
low
collar
pattern
of
the
days
of
seymour
and
blair
white
glazed
as
the
letters
on
the
window
of
the
restaurants
the
at
the
knees
from
the
saddle
grip
the
peculiar
spread
of
the
right
thumb
and
fingers
from
the
stiff
hold
upon
the
circling
lasso
the
deeply
absorbed
weather
tan
that
the
hottest
sun
of
cape
may
can
never
equal
the
blue
eyes
that
unconsciously
divided
the
rushing
crowds
into
fours
as
though
they
were
being
counted
out
of
a
corral
the
segregated
loneliness
and
solemnity
of
expression
as
of
an
emperor
or
of
one
whose
horizons
have
not
intruded
upon
him
nearer
than
a
day
ride
these
brands
of
the
west
were
set
upon
greenbrier
nye
oh
yes
he
wore
a
hat
gentle
reader
just
like
those
the
madison
square
post
office
mail
carriers
wear
when
they
go
up
to
bronx
park
on
sunday
afternoons
suddenly
greenbrier
nye
jumped
into
the
drifting
herd
of
metropolitan
cattle
seized
upon
a
man
dragged
him
out
of
the
stream
and
gave
him
a
buffet
upon
his
that
sent
him
reeling
against
a
wall
the
victim
recovered
his
hat
with
the
angry
look
of
a
new
yorker
who
has
suffered
an
outrage
and
intends
to
write
to
the
trib
about
it
but
he
looked
at
his
assailant
and
knew
that
the
blow
was
in
consideration
of
love
and
affection
after
the
manner
of
the
west
which
greets
its
friends
with
contumely
and
uproar
and
pounding
fists
and
receives
its
enemies
in
decorum
and
order
such
as
the
judicious
placing
of
the
welcoming
bullet
demands
god
in
the
mountains
cried
greenbrier
holding
fast
to
the
foreleg
of
his
cull
can
this
be
longhorn
merritt
the
other
man
was
oh
look
on
broadway
any
day

greenbrier
nye
he
exclaimed
grasping
the
hand
that
had
smitten
him
my
dear
fellow
so
glad
to
see
you
how
did
you
come
to

sure
the
inaugural
ceremonies
i
remember
you
joined
the
rough
riders
you
must
come
and
have
luncheon
with
me
of
course
greenbrier
pinned
him
sadly
but
firmly
to
the
wall
with
a
hand
the
size
shape
and
color
of
a
mcclellan
saddle
longy
he
said
in
a
melancholy
voice
that
disturbed
traffic
what
have
they
been
doing
to
you
you
act
just
like
a
citizen
they
done
made
you
into
an
inmate
of
the
city
directory

such
johnny

execration
of
yourself

any
such
terms

reproach

them

merritt
it

eight
since
we
punched
cows
together
in
old
man
garcia
outfit
well
let
go
to
a
café
anyhow
it
sounds
good
to
hear
it
called
again
they
picked
their
way
through
the
crowd
to
a
hotel
and
drifted
as
by
a
natural
law
to
the
bar
speak
up
invited
greenbrier
a
dry
martini
said
merritt
oh
lord
cried
greenbrier
and
yet
me
and
you
once
saw
the
same
pink
gila
monsters
crawling
up
the
walls
of
the
same
hotel
in
cañon
diablo
a
dry
but
let
that
pass
whiskey
straight
and
they
on
you
merritt
smiled
and
paid
they
lunched
in
a
small
extension
of
the
dining
room
that
connected
with
the
café
merritt
dexterously
diverted
his
friend
choice
that
hovered
over
ham
and
eggs
to
a
purée
of
celery
a
salmon
cutlet
a
partridge
pie
and
a
desirable
salad
on
the
day
said
greenbrier
grieved
and
thunderous
when
i
hold
but
one
drink
before
eating
when
i
meet
a
friend
i
ai
seen
in
eight
years
at
a
by

in
a
town
at
on

merritt

an
absinthe
frappé
and
what

nye
out
of
the
neck
of
a

to
take
it

out
of
the
neck
of

ab
oh

merritt
slipped
the
wine
card
under
his
glass
all
right
i
suppose
you
think
i
spoiled
by
the
city
i
as
good
a
westerner
as
you
are
greenbrier
but
somehow
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
to
go
back
out
there
new
york
is
comfortable
comfortable
i
make
a
good
living
and
i
live
it
no
more
wet
blankets
and
riding
herd
in
snowstorms
and
bacon
and
cold
coffee
and
blowouts
once
in
six
months
for
me
i
reckon
i
hang
out
here
in
the
future
we
take
in
the
theatre
greenbrier
and
after
that
we
dine
at
i
tell
you
what
you
are
merritt
said
greenbrier
laying
one
elbow
in
his
salad
and
the
other
in
his
butter
you
are
a
concentrated
effete
unconditional
miss
sally
walker
god
made
you
perpendicular
and
suitable
to
ride
straddle
and
use
cuss
words
in
the
original
wherefore
you
have
suffered
his
handiwork
to
elapse
by
removing
yourself
to
new
york
and
putting
on
little
shoes
tied
with
strings
and
making
faces
when
you
talk
i
seen
you
rope
and
tie
a
steer
in
if
you
was
to
see
one
now
you
write
to
the
police
commissioner
about
it
and
these
flapdoodle
drinks
that
you
inoculate
your
system
with
these
little
essences
of
cowslip
with
acorns
in
and
paregoric
flip
they
ai
anyways
in
assent
with
the
cordiality
of
manhood
i
hate
to
see
you
this
way
well
greenbrier
said
merritt
with
apology
in
his
tone
in
a
way
you
are
right
sometimes
i
do
feel
like
i
was
being
raised
on
the
bottle
but
i
tell
you
new
york
is
comfortable
comfortable
something
about
it
the
sights
and
the
crowds
and
the
way
it
changes
every
day
and
the
very
air
of
it
that
seems
to
tie
a
stake
rope
around
a
man
neck
with
the
other
end
fastened
somewhere
about
street
i
do
know
what
it
is
god
knows
said
greenbrier
sadly
and
i
know
the
east
has
gobbled
you
up
you
was
venison
and
now
you
veal
you
put
me
in
mind
of
a
japonica
in
a
window
you
been
signed
sealed
and
diskivered
requiescat
in
hoc
signo
you
make
me
thirsty
a
green
chartreuse
here
said
merritt
to
the
waiter
whiskey
straight
sighed
greenbrier
and
they
on
you
you
renegade
of
the
guilty
with
an
application
for
mercy
said
merritt
you
do
know
how
it
is
greenbrier
it
so
comfortable
here
that
please
loan
me
your
smelling
salts
pleaded
greenbrier
if
i
seen
you
once
bluff
three
bluffers
from
mazatzal
city
with
an
empty
gun
in
phoenix
greenbrier
voice
died
away
in
pure
grief
cigars
he
called
harshly
to
the
waiter
to
hide
his
emotion
a
pack
of
turkish
cigarettes
for
mine
said
merritt
they
on
you
chanted
greenbrier
struggling
to
conceal
his
contempt
at
seven
they
dined
in
the
column
that
evening
a
galaxy
had
assembled
there
bright
shone
the
lights
fair
women
and
br
let
it
go
anyhow
brave
men
the
orchestra
played
charmingly
hardly
had
a
tip
from
a
diner
been
placed
in
its
hands
by
a
waiter
when
it
would
burst
forth
into
soniferousness
the
more
beer
you
contributed
to
it
the
more
meyerbeer
it
gave
you
which
is
reciprocity
merritt
put
forth
exertions
on
the
dinner
greenbrier
was
his
old
friend
and
he
liked
him
he
persuaded
him
to
drink
a
cocktail
i
take
the
horehound
tea
said
greenbrier
for
old
times
sake
but
i
prefer
whiskey
straight
they
on
you
right
said
merritt
now
run
your
eye
down
that
bill
of
fare
and
see
if
it
seems
to
hitch
on
any
of
these
items
lay
me
on
my
lava
bed
said
greenbrier
with
bulging
eyes
all
these
specimens
of
nutriment
in
the
grub
wagon
what
this
horse
with
the
heaves
i
pass
but
look
along
here
truck
for
twenty
all
spelled
out
in
different
directions
wait
till
i
see
the
viands
ordered
merritt
turned
to
the
wine
list
this
medoc
is
bad
he
suggested
you
the
doc
said
greenbrier
i
rather
have
whiskey
straight
it
on
you
greenbrier
looked
around
the
room
the
waiter
brought
things
and
took
dishes
away
he
was
observing
he
saw
a
new
york
restaurant
crowd
enjoying
itself
how
was
the
range
when
you
left
the
gila
asked
merritt
fine
said
greenbrier
you
see
that
lady
in
the
red
speckled
silk
at
that
table
well
she
could
warm
over
her
beans
at
my
campfire
yes
the
range
was
good
she
looks
as
nice
as
a
white
mustang
i
see
once
on
black
river
when
the
coffee
came
greenbrier
put
one
foot
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
next
to
him
you
said
it
was
a
comfortable
town
longy
he
said
meditatively
yes
it
a
comfortable
town
it
different
from
the
plains
in
a
blue
norther
what
did
you
call
that
mess
in
the
crock
with
the
handle
longy
oh
yes
squabs
in
a
cash
roll
they
worth
the
roll
that
white
mustang
had
just
such
a
way
of
turning
his
head
and
shaking
his
mane
look
at
her
longy
if
i
thought
i
could
sell
out
my
ranch
at
a
fair
price
i
believe
i
gyar
song
he
suddenly
cried
in
a
voice
that
paralyzed
every
knife
and
fork
in
the
restaurant
the
waiter
dived
toward
the
table
two
more
of
them
cocktail
drinks
ordered
greenbrier
merritt
looked
at
him
and
smiled
significantly
they
on
me
said
greenbrier
blowing
a
puff
of
smoke
to
the
ceiling
x
the
unknown
quantity
the
poet
longfellow
or
was
it
confucius
the
inventor
of
wisdom
remarked
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
things
are
not
what
they
seem
as
mathematics
are
or
is
thanks
old
subscriber
the
only
just
rule
by
which
questions
of
life
can
be
measured
let
us
by
all
means
adjust
our
theme
to
the
straight
edge
and
the
balanced
column
of
the
great
goddess
figures
unassailable
sums
in
addition
shall
be
set
over
against
whatever
opposing
element
there
may
be
a
mathematician
after
scanning
the
above
two
lines
of
poetry
would
say
ahem
young
gentlemen
if
we
assume
that
x
plus
that
is
that
life
is
real
then
things
all
of
which
life
includes
are
real
anything
that
is
real
is
what
it
seems
then
if
we
consider
the
proposition
that
are
not
what
they
seem
why
but
this
is
heresy
and
not
poesy
we
woo
the
sweet
nymph

we
would
conduct
you
into
the
presence
of
the
elusive
seductive
pursued
satisfying
mysterious
x
not
long
before
the
beginning
of
this
century
septimus
kinsolving
an
old
new
yorker
invented
an
idea
he
originated
the
discovery
that
bread
is
made
from
flour
and
not
from
wheat
futures
perceiving
that
the
flour
crop
was
short
and
that
the
stock
exchange
was
having
no
perceptible
effect
on
the
growing
wheat
kinsolving
cornered
the
flour
market
the
result
was
that
when
you
or
my
landlady
before
the
war
she
never
had
to
turn
her
hand
to
anything
southerners
accommodated
bought
a
loaf
of
bread
you
laid
down
an
additional
two
cents
which
went
to
kinsolving
as
a
testimonial
to
his
perspicacity
a
second
result
was
that
kinsolving
quit
the
game
with
prof
er
kinsolving
son
dan
was
at
college
when
the
mathematical
experiment
in
breadstuffs
was
made
dan
came
home
during
vacation
and
found
the
old
gentleman
in
a
red
reading
little
dorrit
on
the
porch
of
his
estimable
red
brick
mansion
in
washington
square
he
had
retired
from
business
with
enough
extra
pieces
from
bread
buyers
to
reach
if
laid
side
by
side
fifteen
times
around
the
earth
and
lap
as
far
as
the
public
debt
of
paraguay
dan
shook
hands
with
his
father
and
hurried
over
to
greenwich
village
to
see
his
old
friend
kenwitz
dan
had
always
admired
kenwitz
kenwitz
was
pale
intense
serious
mathematical
studious
altruistic
socialistic
and
the
natural
foe
of
oligarchies
kenwitz
had
foregone
college
and
was
learning
in
his
father
jewelry
store
dan
was
smiling
jovial
and
tolerant
alike
of
kings
and
ragpickers
the
two
foregathered
joyously
being
opposites
and
then
dan
went
back
to
college
and
kenwitz
to
his
mainsprings
and
to
his
private
library
in
the
rear
of
the
jewelry
shop
four
years
later
dan
came
back
to
washington
square
with
the
accumulations
of
b
and
two
years
of
europe
thick
upon
him
he
took
a
filial
look
at
septimus
kinsolving
elaborate
tombstone
in
greenwood
and
a
tedious
excursion
through
typewritten
documents
with
the
family
lawyer
and
then
feeling
himself
a
lonely
and
hopeless
millionaire
hurried
down
to
the
old
jewelry
store
across
sixth
avenue
kenwitz
unscrewed
a
magnifying
glass
from
his
eye
routed
out
his
parent
from
a
dingy
rear
room
and
abandoned
the
interior
of
watches
for
outdoors
he
went
with
dan
and
they
sat
on
a
bench
in
washington
square
dan
had
not
changed
much
he
was
stalwart
and
had
a
dignity
that
was
inclined
to
relax
into
a
grin
kenwitz
was
more
serious
more
intense
more
learned
philosophical
and
socialistic
i
know
about
it
now
said
dan
finally
i
pumped
it
out
of
the
eminent
legal
lights
that
turned
over
to
me
poor
old
dad
collections
of
bonds
and
boodle
it
amounts
to
ken
and
i
am
told
that
he
squeezed
it
out
of
the
chaps
that
pay
their
pennies
for
loaves
of
bread
at
little
bakeries
around
the
corner
you
studied
economics
dan
and
you
know
all
about
monopolies
and
the
masses
and
octopuses
and
the
rights
of
laboring
people
i
never
thought
about
those
things
before
football
and
trying
to
be
white
to
my
were
about
the
extent
of
my
college
curriculum
but
since
i
came
back
and
found
out
how
dad
made
his
money
i
been
thinking
i
like
awfully
well
to
pay
back
those
chaps
who
had
to
give
up
too
much
money
for
bread
i
know
it
would
buck
the
line
of
my
income
for
a
good
many
yards
but
i
like
to
make
it
square
with
is
there
any
way
it
can
be
done
old
ways
and
means
kenwitz
big
black
eyes
glowed
fierily
his
thin
intellectual
face
took
on
almost
a
sardonic
cast
he
caught
dan
arm
with
the
grip
of
a
friend
and
a
judge
you
ca
do
it
he
said
emphatically
one
of
the
chief
punishments
of
you
men
of
wealth
is
that
when
you
do
repent
you
find
that
you
have
lost
the
power
to
make
reparation
or
restitution
i
admire
your
good
intentions
dan
but
you
ca
do
anything
those
people
were
robbed
of
their
precious
pennies
it
too
late
to
remedy
the
evil
you
ca
pay
them
back
of
course
said
dan
lighting
his
pipe
we
could
hunt
up
every
one
of
the
duffers
and
hand
back
the
right
change
there
an
awful
lot
of
buying
bread
all
the
time
funny
taste
they
have
i
never
cared
for
bread
especially
except
for
a
toasted
cracker
with
the
roquefort
but
we
might
find
a
few
of
and
chuck
some
of
dad
cash
back
where
it
came
from
i
feel
better
if
i
could
it
seems
tough
for
people
to
be
held
up
for
a
soggy
thing
like
bread
one
would
mind
standing
a
rise
in
broiled
lobsters
or
deviled
crabs
get
to
work
and
think
ken
i
want
to
pay
back
all
of
that
money
i
can
there
are
plenty
of
charities
said
kenwitz
mechanically
easy
enough
said
dan
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
i
suppose
i
could
give
the
city
a
park
or
endow
an
asparagus
bed
in
a
hospital
but
i
want
paul
to
get
away
with
the
proceeds
of
the
gold
brick
we
sold
peter
it
the
bread
shorts
i
want
to
cover
ken
the
thin
fingers
of
kenwitz
moved
rapidly
do
you
know
how
much
money
it
would
take
to
pay
back
the
losses
of
consumers
during
that
corner
in
flour
he
asked
i
do
not
said
dan
stoutly
my
lawyer
tells
me
that
i
have
two
millions
if
you
had
a
hundred
millions
said
kenwitz
vehemently
you
repair
a
thousandth
part
of
the
damage
that
has
been
done
you
can
not
conceive
of
the
accumulated
evils
produced
by
misapplied
wealth
each
penny
that
was
wrung
from
the
lean
purses
of
the
poor
reacted
a
thousandfold
to
their
harm
you
do
not
understand
you
do
not
see
how
hopeless
is
your
desire
to
make
restitution
not
in
a
single
instance
can
it
be
done
back
up
philosopher
said
dan
the
penny
has
no
sorrow
that
the
dollar
can
not
heal
not
in
one
instance
repeated
kenwitz
i
will
give
you
one
and
let
us
see
thomas
boyne
had
a
little
bakery
over
there
in
varick
street
he
sold
bread
to
the
poorest
people
when
the
price
of
flour
went
up
he
had
to
raise
the
price
of
bread
his
customers
were
too
poor
to
pay
it
boyne
business
failed
and
he
lost
his
capital
all
he
had
in
the
world
dan
kinsolving
struck
the
park
bench
a
mighty
blow
with
his
fist
i
accept
the
instance
he
cried
take
me
to
boyne
i
will
repay
his
thousand
dollars
and
buy
him
a
new
bakery
write
your
check
said
kenwitz
without
moving
and
then
begin
to
write
checks
in
payment
of
the
train
of
consequences
draw
the
next
one
for
boyne
went
insane
after
his
failure
and
set
fire
to
the
building
from
which
he
was
about
to
be
evicted
the
loss
amounted
to
that
much
boyne
died
in
an
asylum
stick
to
the
instance
said
dan
i
have
noticed
any
insurance
companies
on
my
charity
list
draw
your
next
check
for
went
on
kenwitz
boyne
son
fell
into
bad
ways
after
the
bakery
closed
and
was
accused
of
murder
he
was
acquitted
last
week
after
a
three
years
legal
battle
and
the
state
draws
upon
taxpayers
for
that
much
expense
back
to
the
bakery
exclaimed
dan
impatiently
the
government
does
need
to
stand
in
the
bread
line
the
last
item
of
the
instance
is
come
and
i
will
show
you
said
kenwitz
rising
the
socialistic
watchmaker
was
happy
he
was
a
by
nature
and
a
pessimist
by
trade
kenwitz
would
assure
you
in
one
breath
that
money
was
but
evil
and
corruption
and
that
your
watch
needed
cleaning
and
a
new
he
conducted
kinsolving
southward
out
of
the
square
and
into
ragged
varick
street
up
the
narrow
stairway
of
a
squalid
brick
tenement
he
led
the
penitent
offspring
of
the
octopus
he
knocked
on
a
door
and
a
clear
voice
called
to
them
to
enter
in
that
almost
bare
room
a
young
woman
sat
sewing
at
a
machine
she
nodded
to
kenwitz
as
to
a
familiar
acquaintance
one
little
stream
of
sunlight
through
the
dingy
window
burnished
her
heavy
hair
to
the
color
of
an
ancient
tuscan
shield
she
flashed
a
rippling
smile
at
kenwitz
and
a
look
of
somewhat
flustered
inquiry
kinsolving
stood
regarding
her
clear
and
pathetic
beauty
in
silence
thus
they
came
into
the
presence
of
the
last
item
of
the
instance
how
many
this
week
miss
mary
asked
the
watchmaker
a
mountain
of
coarse
gray
shirts
lay
upon
the
floor
nearly
thirty
dozen
said
the
young
woman
cheerfully
i
made
almost
i
improving
kenwitz
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
so
much
money
her
eyes
turned
brightly
soft
in
the
direction
of
dan
a
little
pink
spot
came
out
on
her
round
pale
cheek
kenwitz
chuckled
like
a
diabolic
raven
miss
boyne
he
said
let
me
present
kinsolving
the
son
of
the
man
who
put
bread
up
five
years
ago
he
thinks
he
would
like
to
do
something
to
aid
those
who
where
inconvenienced
by
that
act
the
smile
left
the
young
woman
face
she
rose
and
pointed
her
forefinger
toward
the
door
this
time
she
looked
kinsolving
straight
in
the
eye
but
it
was
not
a
look
that
gave
delight
the
two
men
went
down
varick
street
kenwitz
letting
all
his
pessimism
and
rancor
and
hatred
of
the
octopus
come
to
the
surface
gibed
at
the
moneyed
side
of
his
friend
in
an
acrid
torrent
of
words
dan
appeared
to
be
listening
and
then
turned
to
kenwitz
and
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
i
obliged
to
you
ken
old
man
he
said
vaguely
a
thousand
times
obliged
mein
gott
you
are
crazy
cried
the
watchmaker
dropping
his
spectacles
for
the
first
time
in
years
two
months
afterward
kenwitz
went
into
a
large
bakery
on
lower
broadway
with
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
that
he
had
mended
for
the
proprietor
a
lady
was
giving
an
order
to
a
clerk
as
kenwitz
passed
her
these
loaves
are
ten
cents
said
the
clerk
i
always
get
them
at
eight
cents
uptown
said
the
lady
you
need
not
fill
the
order
i
will
drive
by
there
on
my
way
home
the
voice
was
familiar
the
watchmaker
paused
mr
kenwitz
cried
the
lady
heartily
how
do
you
do
kenwitz
was
trying
to
train
his
socialistic
and
economic
comprehension
on
her
wonderful
fur
boa
and
the
carriage
waiting
outside
why
miss
boyne
he
began
kinsolving
she
corrected
dan
and
i
were
married
a
month
ago
xi
the
thing
the
play
being
acquainted
with
a
newspaper
reporter
who
had
a
couple
of
free
passes
i
got
to
see
the
performance
a
few
nights
ago
at
one
of
the
popular
vaudeville
houses
one
of
the
numbers
was
a
violin
solo
by
a
man
not
much
past
forty
but
with
very
gray
thick
hair
not
being
afflicted
with
a
taste
for
music
i
let
the
system
of
noises
drift
past
my
ears
while
i
regarded
the
man
there
was
a
story
about
that
chap
a
month
or
two
ago
said
the
reporter
they
gave
me
the
assignment
it
was
to
run
a
column
and
was
to
be
on
the
extremely
light
and
joking
order
the
old
man
seems
to
like
the
funny
touch
i
give
to
local
happenings
oh
yes
i
working
on
a
farce
comedy
now
well
i
went
down
to
the
house
and
got
all
the
details
but
i
certainly
fell
down
on
that
job
i
went
back
and
turned
in
a
comic
of
an
east
side
funeral
instead
why
oh
i
seem
to
get
hold
of
it
with
my
funny
hooks
somehow
maybe
you
could
make
a
tragedy
out
of
it
for
a
i
give
you
the
details
after
the
performance
my
friend
the
reporter
recited
to
me
the
facts
over
the
würzburger
i
see
no
reason
said
i
when
he
had
concluded
why
that
make
a
rattling
good
funny
story
those
three
people
could
have
acted
in
a
more
absurd
and
preposterous
manner
if
they
had
been
real
actors
in
a
real
theatre
i
really
afraid
that
all
the
stage
is
a
world
anyhow
and
all
the
players
men
and
women
thing
the
play
is
the
way
i
quote
mr
shakespeare
try
it
said
the
reporter
i
will
said
i
and
i
did
to
show
him
how
he
could
have
made
a
humorous
column
of
it
for
his
paper
there
stands
a
house
near
abingdon
square
on
the
ground
floor
there
has
been
for
years
a
little
store
where
toys
and
notions
and
stationery
are
sold
one
night
twenty
years
ago
there
was
a
wedding
in
the
rooms
above
the
store
the
widow
mayo
owned
the
house
and
store
her
daughter
helen
was
married
to
frank
barry
john
delaney
was
best
man
helen
was
eighteen
and
her
picture
had
been
printed
in
a
morning
paper
next
to
the
headlines
of
a
wholesale
female
murderess
story
from
butte
mont
but
after
your
eye
and
intelligence
had
rejected
the
connection
you
seized
your
magnifying
glass
and
read
beneath
the
portrait
her
description
as
one
of
a
series
of
prominent
beauties
and
belles
of
the
lower
west
side
frank
barry
and
john
delaney
were
prominent
young
beaux
of
the
same
side
and
bosom
friends
whom
you
expected
to
turn
upon
each
other
every
time
the
curtain
went
up
one
who
pays
his
money
for
orchestra
seats
and
fiction
expects
this
that
is
the
first
funny
idea
that
has
turned
up
in
the
story
yet
both
had
made
a
great
race
for
helen
hand
when
frank
won
john
shook
his
hand
and
congratulated
him
honestly
he
did
after
the
ceremony
helen
ran
upstairs
to
put
on
her
hat
she
was
getting
married
in
a
traveling
dress
she
and
frank
were
going
to
old
point
comfort
for
a
week
downstairs
the
usual
horde
of
gibbering
were
waiting
with
their
hands
full
of
old
congress
gaiters
and
paper
bags
of
hominy
then
there
was
a
rattle
of
the
and
into
her
room
jumps
the
mad
and
infatuated
john
delaney
with
a
damp
curl
drooping
upon
his
forehead
and
made
violent
and
reprehensible
love
to
his
lost
one
entreating
her
to
flee
or
fly
with
him
to
the
riviera
or
the
bronx
or
any
old
place
where
there
are
italian
skies
and
far
it
would
have
carried
blaney
off
his
feet
to
see
helen
repulse
him
with
blazing
and
scornful
eyes
she
fairly
withered
him
by
demanding
whatever
he
meant
by
speaking
to
respectable
people
that
way
in
a
few
moments
she
had
him
going
the
manliness
that
had
possessed
him
departed
he
bowed
low
and
said
something
about
irresistible
impulse
and
forever
carry
in
his
heart
the
memory
of
and
she
suggested
that
he
catch
the
first
going
down
i
will
away
said
john
delaney
to
the
furthermost
parts
of
the
earth
i
can
not
remain
near
you
and
know
that
you
are
another
i
will
to
africa
and
there
amid
other
scenes
strive
to
for
for
goodness
sake
get
out
said
helen
somebody
might
come
in
he
knelt
upon
one
knee
and
she
extended
him
one
white
hand
that
he
might
give
it
a
farewell
kiss
girls
was
this
choice
boon
of
the
great
little
god
cupid
ever
vouchsafed
you
to
have
the
fellow
you
want
hard
and
fast
and
have
the
one
you
do
want
come
with
a
damp
curl
on
his
forehead
and
kneel
to
you
and
babble
of
africa
and
love
which
in
spite
of
everything
shall
forever
bloom
an
amaranth
in
his
heart
to
know
your
power
and
to
feel
the
sweet
security
of
your
own
happy
state
to
send
the
unlucky
one
to
foreign
climes
while
you
congratulate
yourself
as
he
presses
his
last
kiss
upon
your
knuckles
that
your
nails
are
well
manicured
say
girls
it
galluptious
do
ever
let
it
get
by
you
and
then
of
course
how
did
you
guess
it
the
door
opened
and
in
stalked
the
bridegroom
jealous
of
bonnet
strings
the
farewell
kiss
was
imprinted
upon
helen
hand
and
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
sprang
john
delaney
africa
bound
a
little
slow
music
if
you
please
faint
violin
just
a
breath
in
the
clarinet
and
a
touch
of
the
imagine
the
scene
frank
with
the
cry
of
a
man
wounded
to
death
bursting
from
him
helen
rushing
and
clinging
to
him
trying
to
explain
he
catches
her
wrists
and
tears
them
from
his
shoulders
once
twice
thrice
he
sways
her
this
way
and
that
the
stage
manager
will
show
you
how
and
throws
her
from
him
to
the
floor
a
huddled
crushed
moaning
thing
never
he
cries
will
he
look
upon
her
face
again
and
rushes
from
the
house
through
the
staring
groups
of
astonished
guests
and
now
because
it
is
the
thing
instead
of
the
play
the
audience
must
stroll
out
into
the
real
lobby
of
the
world
and
marry
die
grow
gray
rich
poor
happy
or
sad
during
the
intermission
of
twenty
years
which
must
precede
the
rising
of
the
curtain
again
barry
inherited
the
shop
and
the
house
at
she
could
have
bested
many
an
at
a
beauty
show
on
points
and
general
results
only
a
few
people
remembered
her
wedding
comedy
but
she
made
of
it
no
secret
she
did
not
pack
it
in
lavender
or
moth
balls
nor
did
she
sell
it
to
a
magazine
one
day
a
lawyer
who
bought
his
legal
cap
and
ink
of
her
asked
her
across
the
counter
to
marry
him
i
really
much
obliged
to
you
said
helen
cheerfully
but
i
married
another
man
twenty
years
ago
he
was
more
a
goose
than
a
man
but
i
think
i
love
him
yet
i
have
never
seen
him
since
about
half
an
hour
after
the
ceremony
was
it
copying
ink
that
you
wanted
or
just
writing
fluid
the
lawyer
bowed
over
the
counter
with
grace
and
left
a
respectful
kiss
on
the
back
of
her
hand
helen
sighed
parting
salutes
however
romantic
may
be
overdone
here
she
was
at
beautiful
and
admired
and
all
that
she
seemed
to
have
got
from
her
lovers
were
approaches
and
adieus
worse
still
in
the
last
one
she
had
lost
a
customer
too
business
languished
and
she
hung
out
a
room
to
let
card
two
large
rooms
on
the
third
floor
were
prepared
for
desirable
tenants
roomers
came
and
went
regretfully
for
the
house
of
barry
was
the
abode
of
neatness
comfort
and
taste
one
day
came
ramonti
the
violinist
and
engaged
the
front
room
above
the
discord
and
clatter
uptown
offended
his
nice
ear
so
a
friend
had
sent
him
to
this
oasis
in
the
desert
of
noise
ramonti
with
his
still
youthful
face
his
dark
eyebrows
his
short
pointed
foreign
brown
beard
his
distinguished
head
of
gray
hair
and
his
artist
temperament
revealed
in
his
light
gay
and
sympathetic
manner
was
a
welcome
tenant
in
the
old
house
near
abingdon
square
helen
lived
on
the
floor
above
the
store
the
architecture
of
it
was
singular
and
quaint
the
hall
was
large
and
almost
square
up
one
side
of
it
and
then
across
the
end
of
it
ascended
an
open
stairway
to
the
floor
above
this
hall
space
she
had
furnished
as
a
sitting
room
and
office
combined
there
she
kept
her
desk
and
wrote
her
business
letters
and
there
she
sat
of
evenings
by
a
warm
fire
and
a
bright
red
light
and
sewed
or
read
ramonti
found
the
atmosphere
so
agreeable
that
he
spent
much
time
there
describing
to
barry
the
wonders
of
paris
where
he
had
studied
with
a
particularly
notorious
and
noisy
fiddler
next
comes
lodger
no
a
handsome
melancholy
man
in
the
early
with
a
brown
mysterious
beard
and
strangely
pleading
haunting
eyes
he
too
found
the
society
of
helen
a
desirable
thing
with
the
eyes
of
romeo
and
othello
tongue
he
charmed
her
with
tales
of
distant
climes
and
wooed
her
by
respectful
innuendo
from
the
first
helen
felt
a
marvelous
and
compelling
thrill
in
the
presence
of
this
man
his
voice
somehow
took
her
swiftly
back
to
the
days
of
her
youth
romance
this
feeling
grew
and
she
gave
way
to
it
and
it
led
her
to
an
instinctive
belief
that
he
had
been
a
factor
in
that
romance
and
then
with
a
woman
reasoning
oh
yes
they
do
sometimes
she
leaped
over
common
syllogisms
and
theory
and
logic
and
was
sure
that
her
husband
had
come
back
to
her
for
she
saw
in
his
eyes
love
which
no
woman
can
mistake
and
a
thousand
tons
of
regret
and
remorse
which
aroused
pity
which
is
perilously
near
to
love
requited
which
is
the
qua
in
the
house
that
jack
built
but
she
made
no
sign
a
husband
who
steps
around
the
corner
for
twenty
years
and
then
drops
in
again
should
not
expect
to
find
his
slippers
laid
out
too
conveniently
near
nor
a
match
ready
lighted
for
his
cigar
there
must
be
expiation
explanation
and
possibly
execration
a
little
purgatory
and
then
maybe
if
he
were
properly
humble
he
might
be
trusted
with
a
harp
and
crown
and
so
she
made
no
sign
that
she
knew
or
suspected
and
my
friend
the
reporter
could
see
nothing
funny
in
this
sent
out
on
an
assignment
to
write
up
a
roaring
hilarious
brilliant
joshing
story
of
but
i
will
not
knock
a
brother
let
us
go
on
with
the
story
one
evening
ramonti
stopped
in
helen
and
told
his
love
with
the
tenderness
and
ardor
of
the
enraptured
artist
his
words
were
a
bright
flame
of
the
divine
fire
that
glows
in
the
heart
of
a
man
who
is
a
dreamer
and
doer
combined
but
before
you
give
me
an
answer
he
went
on
before
she
could
accuse
him
of
suddenness
i
must
tell
you
that
is
the
only
name
i
have
to
offer
you
my
manager
gave
me
that
i
do
not
know
who
i
am
or
where
i
came
from
my
first
recollection
is
of
opening
my
eyes
in
a
hospital
i
was
a
young
man
and
i
had
been
there
for
weeks
my
life
before
that
is
a
blank
to
me
they
told
me
that
i
was
found
lying
in
the
street
with
a
wound
on
my
head
and
was
brought
there
in
an
ambulance
they
thought
i
must
have
fallen
and
struck
my
head
upon
the
stones
there
was
nothing
to
show
who
i
was
i
have
never
been
able
to
remember
after
i
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
i
took
up
the
violin
i
have
had
success
barry
i
do
not
know
your
name
except
that
i
love
you
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
realized
that
you
were
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
me
and
oh
a
lot
of
stuff
like
that
helen
felt
young
again
first
a
wave
of
pride
and
a
sweet
little
thrill
of
vanity
went
all
over
her
and
then
she
looked
ramonti
in
the
eyes
and
a
tremendous
throb
went
through
her
heart
she
had
expected
that
throb
it
took
her
by
surprise
the
musician
had
become
a
big
factor
in
her
life
and
she
had
been
aware
of
it
ramonti
she
said
sorrowfully
this
was
not
on
the
stage
remember
it
was
in
the
old
home
near
abingdon
square
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
a
married
woman
and
then
she
told
him
the
sad
story
of
her
life
as
a
heroine
must
do
sooner
or
later
either
to
a
theatrical
manager
or
to
a
reporter
ramonti
took
her
hand
bowed
low
and
kissed
it
and
went
up
to
his
room
helen
sat
down
and
looked
mournfully
at
her
hand
well
she
might
three
suitors
had
kissed
it
mounted
their
red
roan
steeds
and
ridden
away
in
an
hour
entered
the
mysterious
stranger
with
the
haunting
eyes
helen
was
in
the
willow
rocker
knitting
a
useless
thing
in
he
ricocheted
from
the
stairs
and
stopped
for
a
chat
sitting
across
the
table
from
her
he
also
poured
out
his
narrative
of
love
and
then
he
said
helen
do
you
not
remember
me
i
think
i
have
seen
it
in
your
eyes
can
you
forgive
the
past
and
remember
the
love
that
has
lasted
for
twenty
years
i
wronged
you
deeply
i
was
afraid
to
come
back
to
you
but
my
love
overpowered
my
reason
can
you
will
you
forgive
me
helen
stood
up
the
mysterious
stranger
held
one
of
her
hands
in
a
strong
and
trembling
clasp
there
she
stood
and
i
pity
the
stage
that
it
has
not
acquired
a
scene
like
that
and
her
emotions
to
portray
for
she
stood
with
a
divided
heart
the
fresh
unforgettable
virginal
love
for
her
bridegroom
was
hers
the
treasured
sacred
honored
memory
of
her
first
choice
filled
half
her
soul
she
leaned
to
that
pure
feeling
honor
and
faith
and
sweet
abiding
romance
bound
her
to
it
but
the
other
half
of
her
heart
and
soul
was
filled
with
something
else
a
later
fuller
nearer
influence
and
so
the
old
fought
against
the
new
and
while
she
hesitated
from
the
room
above
came
the
soft
racking
petitionary
music
of
a
violin
the
hag
music
bewitches
some
of
the
noblest
the
daws
may
peck
upon
one
sleeve
without
injury
but
whoever
wears
his
heart
upon
his
tympanum
gets
it
not
far
from
the
neck
this
music
and
the
musician
called
her
and
at
her
side
honor
and
the
old
love
held
her
back
forgive
me
he
pleaded
twenty
years
is
a
long
time
to
remain
away
from
the
one
you
say
you
love
she
declared
with
a
purgatorial
touch
how
could
i
tell
he
begged
i
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
that
night
when
he
left
i
followed
him
i
was
mad
with
jealousy
on
a
dark
street
i
struck
him
down
he
did
not
rise
i
examined
him
his
head
had
struck
a
stone
i
did
not
intend
to
kill
him
i
was
mad
with
love
and
jealousy
i
hid
near
by
and
saw
an
ambulance
take
him
away
although
you
married
him
helen
are
you
cried
the
woman
with
eyes
snatching
her
hand
away
do
you
remember
me
helen
the
one
who
has
always
loved
you
best
i
am
john
delaney
if
you
can
forgive
but
she
was
gone
leaping
stumbling
hurrying
flying
up
the
stairs
toward
the
music
and
him
who
had
forgotten
but
who
had
known
her
for
his
in
each
of
his
two
existences
and
as
she
climbed
up
she
sobbed
cried
and
sang
frank
frank
frank
three
mortals
thus
juggling
with
years
as
though
they
were
billiard
balls
and
my
friend
the
reporter
could
see
anything
funny
in
it
xii
a
ramble
in
aphasia
my
wife
and
i
parted
on
that
morning
in
precisely
our
usual
manner
she
left
her
second
cup
of
tea
to
follow
me
to
the
front
door
there
she
plucked
from
my
lapel
the
invisible
strand
of
lint
the
universal
act
of
woman
to
proclaim
ownership
and
bade
me
to
take
care
of
my
cold
i
had
no
cold
next
came
her
kiss
of
parting
the
level
kiss
of
domesticity
flavored
with
young
hyson
there
was
no
fear
of
the
extemporaneous
of
variety
spicing
her
infinite
custom
with
the
deft
touch
of
long
malpractice
she
dabbed
awry
my
scarf
pin
and
then
as
i
closed
the
door
i
heard
her
morning
slippers
pattering
back
to
her
cooling
tea
when
i
set
out
i
had
no
thought
or
premonition
of
what
was
to
occur
the
attack
came
suddenly
for
many
weeks
i
had
been
toiling
almost
night
and
day
at
a
famous
railroad
law
case
that
i
won
triumphantly
but
a
few
days
previously
in
fact
i
had
been
digging
away
at
the
law
almost
without
cessation
for
many
years
once
or
twice
good
doctor
volney
my
friend
and
physician
had
warned
me
if
you
do
slacken
up
bellford
he
said
you
go
suddenly
to
pieces
either
your
nerves
or
your
brain
will
give
way
tell
me
does
a
week
pass
in
which
you
do
not
read
in
the
papers
of
a
case
of
aphasia
of
some
man
lost
wandering
nameless
with
his
past
and
his
identity
blotted
out
and
all
from
that
little
brain
clot
made
by
overwork
or
worry
i
always
thought
said
i
that
the
clot
in
those
instances
was
really
to
be
found
on
the
brains
of
the
newspaper
reporters
doctor
volney
shook
his
head
the
disease
exists
he
said
you
need
a
change
or
a
rest
office
and
home
there
is
the
only
route
you
travel
for
recreation
you
read
law
books
better
take
warning
in
time
on
thursday
nights
i
said
defensively
my
wife
and
i
play
cribbage
on
sundays
she
reads
to
me
the
weekly
letter
from
her
mother
that
law
books
are
not
a
recreation
remains
yet
to
be
established
that
morning
as
i
walked
i
was
thinking
of
doctor
volney
words
i
was
feeling
as
well
as
i
usually
did
possibly
in
better
spirits
than
usual
i
woke
with
stiff
and
cramped
muscles
from
having
slept
long
on
the
incommodious
seat
of
a
day
coach
i
leaned
my
head
against
the
seat
and
tried
to
think
after
a
long
time
i
said
to
myself
i
must
have
a
name
of
some
sort
i
searched
my
pockets
not
a
card
not
a
letter
not
a
paper
or
monogram
could
i
find
but
i
found
in
my
coat
pocket
nearly
in
bills
of
large
denomination
i
must
be
some
one
of
course
i
repeated
to
myself
and
began
again
to
consider
the
car
was
well
crowded
with
men
among
whom
i
told
myself
there
must
have
been
some
common
interest
for
they
intermingled
freely
and
seemed
in
the
best
good
humor
and
spirits
one
of
them
a
stout
spectacled
gentleman
enveloped
in
a
decided
odor
of
cinnamon
and
aloes
took
the
vacant
half
of
my
seat
with
a
friendly
nod
and
unfolded
a
newspaper
in
the
intervals
between
his
periods
of
reading
we
conversed
as
travelers
will
on
current
affairs
i
found
myself
able
to
sustain
the
conversation
on
such
subjects
with
credit
at
least
to
my
memory
by
and
by
my
companion
said
you
are
one
of
us
of
course
fine
lot
of
men
the
west
sends
in
this
time
i
glad
they
held
the
convention
in
new
york
i
never
been
east
before
my
name
bolder
bolder
son
of
hickory
grove
missouri
though
unprepared
i
rose
to
the
emergency
as
men
will
when
put
to
it
now
must
i
hold
a
christening
and
be
at
once
babe
parson
and
parent
my
senses
came
to
the
rescue
of
my
slower
brain
the
insistent
odor
of
drugs
from
my
companion
supplied
one
idea
a
glance
at
his
newspaper
where
my
eye
met
a
conspicuous
advertisement
assisted
me
further
my
name
said
i
glibly
is
edward
pinkhammer
i
am
a
druggist
and
my
home
is
in
cornopolis
kansas
i
knew
you
were
a
druggist
said
my
fellow
traveler
affably
i
saw
the
callous
spot
on
your
right
forefinger
where
the
handle
of
the
pestle
rubs
of
course
you
are
a
delegate
to
our
national
convention
are
all
these
men
druggists
i
asked
wonderingly
they
are
this
car
came
through
from
the
west
and
they
your
druggists
too
none
of
your
patent
pharmashootists
that
use
slot
machines
instead
of
a
prescription
desk
we
percolate
our
own
paregoric
and
roll
our
own
pills
and
we
above
handling
a
few
garden
seeds
in
the
spring
and
carrying
a
side
line
of
confectionery
and
shoes
i
tell
you
hampinker
i
got
an
idea
to
spring
on
this
convention
new
ideas
is
what
they
want
now
you
know
the
shelf
bottles
of
tartar
emetic
and
rochelle
salt
ant
et
pot
tart
and
sod
et
pot
one
poison
you
know
and
the
harmless
it
easy
to
mistake
one
label
for
the
other
where
do
druggists
mostly
keep
why
as
far
apart
as
possible
on
different
shelves
that
wrong
i
say
keep
side
by
side
so
when
you
want
one
you
can
always
compare
it
with
the
other
and
avoid
mistakes
do
you
catch
the
idea
it
seems
to
me
a
very
good
one
i
said
all
right
when
i
spring
it
on
the
convention
you
back
it
up
make
some
of
these
eastern
professors
that
think
they
the
only
lozenges
in
the
market
look
like
hypodermic
tablets
if
i
can
be
of
any
aid
i
said
warming
the
two
bottles
of
er
tartrate
of
antimony
and
potash
and
tartrate
of
soda
and
potash
shall
henceforth
sit
side
by
side
i
concluded
firmly
now
there
another
thing
said
mr
bolder
for
an
excipient
in
manipulating
a
pill
mass
which
do
you
prefer
the
magnesia
carbonate
or
the
pulverised
glycerrhiza
radix
the
er
magnesia
i
said
it
was
easier
to
say
than
the
other
word
mr
bolder
glanced
at
me
distrustfully
through
his
spectacles
give
me
the
glycerrhiza
said
he
magnesia
cakes
here
another
one
of
these
fake
aphasia
cases
he
said
presently
handing
me
his
newspaper
and
laying
his
finger
upon
an
article
i
do
believe
in
i
put
nine
out
of
ten
of
down
as
frauds
a
man
gets
sick
of
his
business
and
his
folks
and
wants
to
have
a
good
time
he
skips
out
somewhere
and
when
they
find
him
he
pretends
to
have
lost
his
memory
do
know
his
own
name
and
wo
even
recognize
the
strawberry
mark
on
his
wife
left
shoulder
aphasia
tut
why
they
stay
at
home
and
forget
i
took
the
paper
and
read
after
the
pungent
headlines
the
following
denver
june
elwyn
bellford
a
prominent
lawyer
is
mysteriously
missing
from
his
home
since
three
days
ago
and
all
efforts
to
locate
him
have
been
in
vain
bellford
is
a
citizen
of
the
highest
standing
and
has
enjoyed
a
large
and
lucrative
law
practice
he
is
married
and
owns
a
fine
home
and
the
most
extensive
private
library
in
the
state
on
the
day
of
his
disappearance
he
drew
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
from
his
bank
no
one
can
be
found
who
saw
him
after
he
left
the
bank
bellford
was
a
man
of
singularly
quiet
and
domestic
tastes
and
seemed
to
find
his
happiness
in
his
home
and
profession
if
any
clue
at
all
exists
to
his
strange
disappearance
it
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
for
some
months
he
has
been
deeply
absorbed
in
an
important
law
case
in
connection
with
the
and
z
railroad
company
it
is
feared
that
overwork
may
have
affected
his
mind
every
effort
is
being
made
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
man
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
altogether
uncynical
mr
bolder
i
said
after
i
had
read
the
despatch
this
has
the
sound
to
me
of
a
genuine
case
why
should
this
man
prosperous
happily
married
and
respected
choose
suddenly
to
abandon
everything
i
know
that
these
lapses
of
memory
do
occur
and
that
men
do
find
themselves
adrift
without
a
name
a
history
or
a
home
oh
gammon
and
jalap
said
mr
bolder
it
larks
they
after
there
too
much
education
nowadays
men
know
about
aphasia
and
they
use
it
for
an
excuse
the
women
are
wise
too
when
it
all
over
they
look
you
in
the
eye
as
scientific
as
you
please
and
say
hypnotized
me
thus
mr
bolder
diverted
but
did
not
aid
me
with
his
comments
and
philosophy
we
arrived
in
new
york
about
ten
at
night
i
rode
in
a
cab
to
a
hotel
and
i
wrote
my
name
edward
pinkhammer
in
the
register
as
i
did
so
i
felt
pervade
me
a
splendid
wild
intoxicating
buoyancy
a
sense
of
unlimited
freedom
of
newly
attained
possibilities
i
was
just
born
into
the
world
the
old
fetters
whatever
they
had
been
were
stricken
from
my
hands
and
feet
the
future
lay
before
me
a
clear
road
such
as
an
infant
enters
and
i
could
set
out
upon
it
equipped
with
a
learning
and
experience
i
thought
the
hotel
clerk
looked
at
me
five
seconds
too
long
i
had
no
baggage
the
druggists
convention
i
said
my
trunk
has
somehow
failed
to
arrive
i
drew
out
a
roll
of
money
ah
said
he
showing
an
auriferous
tooth
we
have
quite
a
number
of
the
western
delegates
stopping
here
he
struck
a
bell
for
the
boy
i
endeavored
to
give
color
to
my
rôle
there
is
an
important
movement
on
foot
among
us
westerners
i
said
in
regard
to
a
recommendation
to
the
convention
that
the
bottles
containing
the
tartrate
of
antimony
and
potash
and
the
tartrate
of
sodium
and
potash
be
kept
in
a
contiguous
position
on
the
shelf
gentleman
to
said
the
clerk
hastily
i
was
whisked
away
to
my
room
the
next
day
i
bought
a
trunk
and
clothing
and
began
to
live
the
life
of
edward
pinkhammer
i
did
not
tax
my
brain
with
endeavors
to
solve
problems
of
the
past
it
was
a
piquant
and
sparkling
cup
that
the
great
island
city
held
up
to
my
lips
i
drank
of
it
gratefully
the
keys
of
manhattan
belong
to
him
who
is
able
to
bear
them
you
must
be
either
the
city
guest
or
its
victim
the
following
few
days
were
as
gold
and
silver
edward
pinkhammer
yet
counting
back
to
his
birth
by
hours
only
knew
the
rare
joy
of
having
come
upon
so
diverting
a
world
and
unrestrained
i
sat
entranced
on
the
magic
carpets
provided
in
theatres
and
that
transported
one
into
strange
and
delightful
lands
full
of
frolicsome
music
pretty
girls
and
grotesque
drolly
extravagant
parodies
upon
human
kind
i
went
here
and
there
at
my
own
dear
will
bound
by
no
limits
of
space
time
or
comportment
i
dined
in
weird
cabarets
at
weirder
to
the
sound
of
hungarian
music
and
the
wild
shouts
of
mercurial
artists
and
sculptors
or
again
where
the
night
life
quivers
in
the
electric
glare
like
a
kinetoscopic
picture
and
the
millinery
of
the
world
and
its
jewels
and
the
ones
whom
they
adorn
and
the
men
who
make
all
three
possible
are
met
for
good
cheer
and
the
spectacular
effect
and
among
all
these
scenes
that
i
have
mentioned
i
learned
one
thing
that
i
never
knew
before
and
that
is
that
the
key
to
liberty
is
not
in
the
hands
of
license
but
convention
holds
it
comity
has
a
at
which
you
must
pay
or
you
may
not
enter
the
land
of
freedom
in
all
the
glitter
the
seeming
disorder
the
parade
the
abandon
i
saw
this
law
unobtrusive
yet
like
iron
prevail
therefore
in
manhattan
you
must
obey
these
unwritten
laws
and
then
you
will
be
freest
of
the
free
if
you
decline
to
be
bound
by
them
you
put
on
shackles
sometimes
as
my
mood
urged
me
i
would
seek
the
stately
softly
murmuring
palm
rooms
redolent
with
life
and
delicate
restraint
in
which
to
dine
again
i
would
go
down
to
the
waterways
in
steamers
packed
with
vociferous
bedecked
unchecked
clerks
and
to
their
crude
pleasures
on
the
island
shores
and
there
was
always
broadway
glistening
opulent
wily
varying
desirable
broadway
growing
upon
one
like
an
opium
habit
one
afternoon
as
i
entered
my
hotel
a
stout
man
with
a
big
nose
and
a
black
mustache
blocked
my
way
in
the
corridor
when
i
would
have
passed
around
him
he
greet
me
with
offensive
familiarity
hello
bellford
he
cried
loudly
what
the
deuce
are
you
doing
in
new
york
did
know
anything
could
drag
you
away
from
that
old
book
den
of
yours
is
along
or
is
this
a
little
business
run
alone
eh
you
have
made
a
mistake
sir
i
said
coldly
releasing
my
hand
from
his
grasp
my
name
is
pinkhammer
you
will
excuse
me
the
man
dropped
to
one
side
apparently
astonished
as
i
walked
to
the
clerk
desk
i
heard
him
call
to
a
bell
boy
and
say
something
about
telegraph
blanks
you
will
give
me
my
bill
i
said
to
the
clerk
and
have
my
baggage
brought
down
in
half
an
hour
i
do
not
care
to
remain
where
i
am
annoyed
by
confidence
men
i
moved
that
afternoon
to
another
hotel
a
sedate
one
on
lower
fifth
avenue
there
was
a
restaurant
a
little
way
off
broadway
where
one
could
be
served
almost
in
a
tropic
array
of
screening
flora
quiet
and
luxury
and
a
perfect
service
made
it
an
ideal
place
in
which
to
take
luncheon
or
refreshment
one
afternoon
i
was
there
picking
my
way
to
a
table
among
the
ferns
when
i
felt
my
sleeve
caught
mr
bellford
exclaimed
an
amazingly
sweet
voice
i
turned
quickly
to
see
a
lady
seated
alone
a
lady
of
about
thirty
with
exceedingly
handsome
eyes
who
looked
at
me
as
though
i
had
been
her
very
dear
friend
you
were
about
to
pass
me
she
said
accusingly
do
tell
me
you
do
not
know
me
why
should
we
not
shake
hands
at
least
once
in
fifteen
years
i
shook
hands
with
her
at
once
i
took
a
chair
opposite
her
at
the
table
i
summoned
with
my
eyebrows
a
hovering
waiter
the
lady
was
philandering
with
an
orange
ice
i
ordered
a
de
her
hair
was
reddish
bronze
you
could
not
look
at
it
because
you
could
not
look
away
from
her
eyes
but
you
were
conscious
of
it
as
you
are
conscious
of
sunset
while
you
look
into
the
profundities
of
a
wood
at
twilight
are
you
sure
you
know
me
i
asked
no
she
said
smiling
i
was
never
sure
of
that
what
would
you
think
i
said
a
little
anxiously
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
my
name
is
edward
pinkhammer
from
cornopolis
kansas
what
would
i
think
she
repeated
with
a
merry
glance
why
that
you
had
not
brought
bellford
to
new
york
with
you
of
course
i
do
wish
you
had
i
would
have
liked
to
see
marian
her
voice
lowered
slightly
you
have
changed
much
elwyn
i
felt
her
wonderful
eyes
searching
mine
and
my
face
more
closely
yes
you
have
she
amended
and
there
was
a
soft
exultant
note
in
her
latest
tones
i
see
it
now
you
have
forgotten
you
forgotten
for
a
year
or
a
day
or
an
hour
i
told
you
you
never
could
i
poked
my
straw
anxiously
in
the
de
i
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
a
little
uneasy
at
her
gaze
but
that
is
just
the
trouble
i
have
forgotten
i
forgotten
everything
she
flouted
my
denial
she
laughed
deliciously
at
something
she
seemed
to
see
in
my
face
i
heard
of
you
at
times
she
went
on
you
quite
a
big
lawyer
out
west
denver
is
it
or
los
angeles
marian
must
be
very
proud
of
you
you
knew
i
suppose
that
i
married
six
months
after
you
did
you
may
have
seen
it
in
the
papers
the
flowers
alone
cost
two
thousand
dollars
she
had
mentioned
fifteen
years
fifteen
years
is
a
long
time
would
it
be
too
late
i
asked
somewhat
timorously
to
offer
you
congratulations
not
if
you
dare
do
it
she
answered
with
such
fine
intrepidity
that
i
was
silent
and
began
to
crease
patterns
on
the
cloth
with
my
thumb
nail
tell
me
one
thing
she
said
leaning
toward
me
rather
eagerly
a
thing
i
have
wanted
to
know
for
many
years
just
from
a
curiosity
of
course
have
you
ever
dared
since
that
night
to
touch
smell
or
look
at
white
roses
at
white
roses
wet
with
rain
and
dew
i
took
a
sip
of
de
it
would
be
useless
i
suppose
i
said
with
a
sigh
for
me
to
repeat
that
i
have
no
recollection
at
all
about
these
things
my
memory
is
completely
at
fault
i
need
not
say
how
much
i
regret
it
the
lady
rested
her
arms
upon
the
table
and
again
her
eyes
disdained
my
words
and
went
traveling
by
their
own
route
direct
to
my
soul
she
laughed
softly
with
a
strange
quality
in
the
sound
it
was
a
laugh
of
happiness
yes
and
of
content
and
of
misery
i
tried
to
look
away
from
her
you
lie
elwyn
bellford
she
breathed
blissfully
oh
i
know
you
lie
i
gazed
dully
into
the
ferns
my
name
is
edward
pinkhammer
i
said
i
came
with
the
delegates
to
the
druggists
national
convention
there
is
a
movement
on
foot
for
arranging
a
new
position
for
the
bottles
of
tartrate
of
antimony
and
tartrate
of
potash
in
which
very
likely
you
would
take
little
interest
a
shining
landau
stopped
before
the
entrance
the
lady
rose
i
took
her
hand
and
bowed
i
am
deeply
sorry
i
said
to
her
that
i
can
not
remember
i
could
explain
but
fear
you
would
not
understand
you
will
not
concede
pinkhammer
and
i
really
can
not
at
all
conceive
of
the
the
roses
and
other
things
bellford
she
said
with
her
happy
sorrowful
smile
as
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
i
attended
the
theatre
that
night
when
i
returned
to
my
hotel
a
quiet
man
in
dark
clothes
who
seemed
interested
in
rubbing
his
finger
nails
with
a
silk
handkerchief
appeared
magically
at
my
side
pinkhammer
he
said
giving
the
bulk
of
his
attention
to
his
forefinger
may
i
request
you
to
step
aside
with
me
for
a
little
conversation
there
is
a
room
here
certainly
i
answered
he
conducted
me
into
a
small
private
parlor
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
were
there
the
lady
i
surmised
would
have
been
unusually
had
her
features
not
been
clouded
by
an
expression
of
keen
worry
and
fatigue
she
was
of
a
style
of
figure
and
possessed
coloring
and
features
that
were
agreeable
to
my
fancy
she
was
in
a
traveling
dress
she
fixed
upon
me
an
earnest
look
of
extreme
anxiety
and
pressed
an
unsteady
hand
to
her
bosom
i
think
she
would
have
started
forward
but
the
gentleman
arrested
her
movement
with
an
authoritative
motion
of
his
hand
he
then
came
himself
to
meet
me
he
was
a
man
of
forty
a
little
gray
about
the
temples
and
with
a
strong
thoughtful
face
bellford
old
man
he
said
cordially
i
glad
to
see
you
again
of
course
we
know
everything
is
all
right
i
warned
you
you
know
that
you
were
overdoing
it
now
you
go
back
with
us
and
be
yourself
again
in
no
time
i
smiled
ironically
i
have
been
so
often
i
said
that
it
has
lost
its
edge
still
in
the
end
it
may
grow
wearisome
would
you
be
willing
at
all
to
entertain
the
hypothesis
that
my
name
is
edward
pinkhammer
and
that
i
never
saw
you
before
in
my
life
before
the
man
could
reply
a
wailing
cry
came
from
the
woman
she
sprang
past
his
detaining
arm
elwyn
she
sobbed
and
cast
herself
upon
me
and
clung
tight
elwyn
she
cried
again
do
break
my
heart
i
am
your
wife
call
my
name
once
just
once
i
could
see
you
dead
rather
than
this
way
i
unwound
her
arms
respectfully
but
firmly
madam
i
said
severely
pardon
me
if
i
suggest
that
you
accept
a
resemblance
too
precipitately
it
is
a
pity
i
went
on
with
an
amused
laugh
as
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
this
bellford
and
i
could
not
be
kept
side
by
side
upon
the
same
shelf
like
tartrates
of
sodium
and
antimony
for
purposes
of
identification
in
order
to
understand
the
allusion
i
concluded
airily
it
may
be
necessary
for
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
proceedings
of
the
druggists
national
convention
the
lady
turned
to
her
companion
and
grasped
his
arm
what
is
it
doctor
volney
oh
what
is
it
she
moaned
he
led
her
to
the
door
go
to
your
room
for
a
while
i
heard
him
say
i
will
remain
and
talk
with
him
his
mind
no
i
think
not
only
a
portion
of
the
brain
yes
i
am
sure
he
will
recover
go
to
your
room
and
leave
me
with
him
the
lady
disappeared
the
man
in
dark
clothes
also
went
outside
still
manicuring
himself
in
a
thoughtful
way
i
think
he
waited
in
the
hall
i
would
like
to
talk
with
you
a
while
pinkhammer
if
i
may
said
the
gentleman
who
remained
very
well
if
you
care
to
i
replied
and
will
excuse
me
if
i
take
it
comfortably
i
am
rather
tired
i
stretched
myself
upon
a
couch
by
a
window
and
lit
a
cigar
he
drew
a
chair
nearby
let
us
speak
to
the
point
he
said
soothingly
your
name
is
not
pinkhammer
i
know
that
as
well
as
you
do
i
said
coolly
but
a
man
must
have
a
name
of
some
sort
i
can
assure
you
that
i
do
not
extravagantly
admire
the
name
of
pinkhammer
but
when
one
christens
one
self
suddenly
the
fine
names
do
not
seem
to
suggest
themselves
but
suppose
it
had
been
scheringhausen
or
scroggins
i
think
i
did
very
well
with
pinkhammer
your
name
said
the
other
man
seriously
is
elwyn
bellford
you
are
one
of
the
first
lawyers
in
denver
you
are
suffering
from
an
attack
of
aphasia
which
has
caused
you
to
forget
your
identity
the
cause
of
it
was
to
your
profession
and
perhaps
a
life
too
bare
of
natural
recreation
and
pleasures
the
lady
who
has
just
left
the
room
is
your
wife
she
is
what
i
would
call
a
woman
i
said
after
a
judicial
pause
i
particularly
admire
the
shade
of
brown
in
her
hair
she
is
a
wife
to
be
proud
of
since
your
disappearance
nearly
two
weeks
ago
she
has
scarcely
closed
her
eyes
we
learned
that
you
were
in
new
york
through
a
telegram
sent
by
isidore
newman
a
traveling

a
little
frown

a
physician
is
aphasia
curable
when
a
man
loses
his
memory
does
it

or
suddenly

and
imperfectly
sometimes
as
suddenly

went

my
case
doctor

i
asked

said
doctor
volney
i
got
up
from
the
couch
some
one
had
set
a
vase
of
white
roses
on
the
centre
table
a
cluster
of
white
roses
freshly
sprinkled
and
fragrant
i
threw
them
far
out
of
the
window
and
then
i
laid
myself
upon
the
couch

according
to

californians
are
a
race
of
people
they
are
not
merely
inhabitants
of
a

they
are
the
southerners
of
the

now
chicagoans
are
no

loyal
to
their
city
but
when
you
ask
them
why
they
stammer
and
speak
of
lake
fish
and
the

building
but
californians
go
into
detail
of
course
they
have
in

climate
an
argument
that
is
good
for
half
an
hour
while
you
are
thinking
of
your
coal
bills
and
heavy
underwear
but
as
soon
as
they
come
to
mistake
your
silence
for
conviction
madness
comes
upon
them
and
they
picture
the
city
of
the
golden

as
the
bagdad
of
the

so
far
as
a
matter
of
opinion
no
refutation
is
necessary
but
dear
cousins
all
from

and
eve
descended
it
is
a
rash
one
who
will
lay
his
finger
on
the
map
and
say
in
this
town
there
can
be
no
romance
what
could
happen
here
yes
it
is
a
bold
and
a
rash
deed

this

i
stepped

conception
of

drizzle
it
is
not
so
fragrant
as
a
nor
as
thick
as
but
is
enough
serve
i
went
to
a
hotel
in
a
tumbril
it
required
strong
for
me
to
keep
from
climbing
to
the
top
of
it
and
giving
an
imitation
of
sidney
carton
the
vehicle
was
drawn
by
beasts
of
a
bygone
era
and
driven
by
something
dark
and
emancipated
i
was
sleepy
and
tired
so
when
i
got
to
the
hotel
i
hurriedly
paid
it
the
fifty
cents
it
demanded
with
approximate
lagniappe
i
assure
you
i
knew
its
habits
and
i
did
not
want
to
hear
it
prate
about
its
old
marster
or
anything
that
happened
befo
de
wah
the
hotel
was
one
of
the
kind
described
as
renovated
that
means
worth
of
new
marble
pillars
tiling
electric
lights
and
brass
cuspidors
in
the
lobby
and
a
new
time
table
and
a
lithograph
of
lookout
mountain
in
each
one
of
the
great
rooms
above
the
management
was
without
reproach
the
attention
full
of
exquisite
southern
courtesy
the
service
as
slow
as
the
progress
of
a
snail
and
as
as
rip
van
winkle
the
food
was
worth
traveling
a
thousand
miles
for
there
is
no
other
hotel
in
the
world
where
you
can
get
such
chicken
livers
at
dinner
i
asked
a
negro
waiter
if
there
was
anything
doing
in
town
he
pondered
gravely
for
a
minute
and
then
replied
well
boss
i
really
reckon
there
anything
at
all
doin
after
sundown
sundown
had
been
accomplished
it
had
been
drowned
in
the
drizzle
long
before
so
that
spectacle
was
denied
me
but
i
went
forth
upon
the
streets
in
the
drizzle
to
see
what
might
be
there
it
is
built
on
undulating
grounds
and
the
streets
are
lighted
by
electricity
at
a
cost
of
per
annum
as
i
left
the
hotel
there
was
a
race
riot
down
upon
me
charged
a
company
of
freedmen
or
arabs
or
zulus
armed
with
no
i
saw
with
relief
that
they
were
not
rifles
but
whips
and
i
saw
dimly
a
caravan
of
black
clumsy
vehicles
and
at
the
reassuring
shouts
kyar
you
anywhere
in
the
town
boss
fuh
fifty
cents
i
reasoned
that
i
was
merely
a
fare
instead
of
a
victim
i
walked
through
long
streets
all
leading
uphill
i
wondered
how
those
streets
ever
came
down
again
perhaps
they
did
until
they
were
graded
on
a
few
of
the
main
streets
i
saw
lights
in
stores
here
and
there
saw
street
cars
go
by
conveying
worthy
burghers
hither
and
yon
saw
people
pass
engaged
in
the
art
of
conversation
and
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
issuing
from
a
and
parlor
the
streets
other
than
main
seemed
to
have
enticed
upon
their
borders
houses
consecrated
to
peace
and
domesticity
in
many
of
them
lights
shone
behind
discreetly
drawn
window
shades
in
a
few
pianos
tinkled
orderly
and
irreproachable
music
there
was
indeed
little
doing
i
wished
i
had
come
before
sundown
so
i
returned
to
my
hotel
in
november
the
confederate
general
hood
advanced
against
nashville
where
he
shut
up
a
national
force
under
general
thomas
the
latter
then
sallied
forth
and
defeated
the
confederates
in
a
terrible
conflict
all
my
life
i
have
heard
of
admired
and
witnessed
the
fine
marksmanship
of
the
south
in
its
peaceful
conflicts
in
the
regions
but
in
my
hotel
a
surprise
awaited
me
there
were
twelve
bright
new
imposing
capacious
brass
cuspidors
in
the
great
lobby
tall
enough
to
be
called
urns
and
so
that
the
crack
pitcher
of
a
lady
baseball
team
should
have
been
able
to
throw
a
ball
into
one
of
them
at
five
paces
distant
but
although
a
terrible
battle
had
raged
and
was
still
raging
the
enemy
had
not
suffered
bright
new
imposing
capacious
untouched
they
stood
but
shades
of
jefferson
brick
the
tile
floor
the
beautiful
tile
floor
i
could
not
avoid
thinking
of
the
battle
of
nashville
and
trying
to
draw
as
is
my
foolish
habit
some
deductions
about
hereditary
marksmanship
here
i
first
saw
major
by
misplaced
courtesy
wentworth
caswell
i
knew
him
for
a
type
the
moment
my
eyes
suffered
from
the
sight
of
him
a
rat
has
no
geographical
habitat
my
old
friend
tennyson
said
as
he
so
well
said
almost
everything
prophet
curse
me
the
blabbing
lip
and
curse
me
the
british
vermin
the
rat
let
us
regard
the
word
british
as
interchangeable
a
rat
is
a
rat
this
man
was
hunting
about
the
hotel
lobby
like
a
starved
dog
that
had
forgotten
where
he
had
buried
a
bone
he
had
a
face
of
great
acreage
red
pulpy
and
with
a
kind
of
sleepy
massiveness
like
that
of
buddha
he
possessed
one
single
virtue
he
was
very
smoothly
shaven
the
mark
of
the
beast
is
not
indelible
upon
a
man
until
he
goes
about
with
a
stubble
i
think
that
if
he
had
not
used
his
razor
that
day
i
would
have
repulsed
his
advances
and
the
criminal
calendar
of
the
world
would
have
been
spared
the
addition
of
one
murder
i
happened
to
be
standing
within
five
feet
of
a
cuspidor
when
major
caswell
opened
fire
upon
it
i
had
been
observant
enough
to
perceive
that
the
attacking
force
was
using
gatlings
instead
of
squirrel
rifles
so
i
so
promptly
that
the
major
seized
the
opportunity
to
apologize
to
a
noncombatant
he
had
the
blabbing
lip
in
four
minutes
he
had
become
my
friend
and
had
dragged
me
to
the
bar
i
desire
to
interpolate
here
that
i
am
a
southerner
but
i
am
not
one
by
profession
or
trade
i
eschew
the
string
tie
the
slouch
hat
the
prince
albert
the
number
of
bales
of
cotton
destroyed
by
sherman
and
plug
chewing
when
the
orchestra
plays
dixie
i
do
not
cheer
i
slide
a
little
lower
on
the
seat
and
well
order
another
würzburger
and
wish
that
longstreet
had
but
what
the
use
major
caswell
banged
the
bar
with
his
fist
and
the
first
gun
at
fort
sumter
when
he
fired
the
last
one
at
appomattox
i
began
to
hope
but
then
he
began
on
family
trees
and
demonstrated
that
adam
was
only
a
third
cousin
of
a
collateral
branch
of
the
caswell
family
genealogy
disposed
of
he
took
up
to
my
distaste
his
private
family
matters
he
spoke
of
his
wife
traced
her
descent
back
to
eve
and
profanely
denied
any
possible
rumor
that
she
may
have
had
relations
in
the
land
of
nod
by
this
time
i
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
he
was
trying
to
obscure
by
noise
the
fact
that
he
had
ordered
the
drinks
on
the
chance
that
i
would
be
bewildered
into
paying
for
them
but
when
they
were
down
he
crashed
a
silver
dollar
loudly
upon
the
bar
then
of
course
another
serving
was
obligatory
and
when
i
had
paid
for
that
i
took
leave
of
him
brusquely
for
i
wanted
no
more
of
him
but
before
i
had
obtained
my
release
he
had
prated
loudly
of
an
income
that
his
wife
received
and
showed
a
handful
of
silver
money
when
i
got
my
key
at
the
desk
the
clerk
said
to
me
courteously
if
that
man
caswell
has
annoyed
you
and
if
you
would
like
to
make
a
complaint
we
will
have
him
ejected
he
is
a
nuisance
a
loafer
and
without
any
known
means
of
support
although
he
seems
to
have
some
money
most
the
time
but
we
do
seem
to
be
able
to
hit
upon
any
means
of
throwing
him
out
legally
why
no
said
i
after
some
reflection
i
do
see
my
way
clear
to
making
a
complaint
but
i
would
like
to
place
myself
on
record
as
asserting
that
i
do
not
care
for
his
company
your
town
i
continued
seems
to
be
a
quiet
one
what
manner
of
entertainment
adventure
or
excitement
have
you
to
offer
to
the
stranger
within
your
gates
well
sir
said
the
clerk
there
will
be
a
show
here
next
thursday
it
is
i
look
it
up
and
have
the
announcement
sent
up
to
your
room
with
the
ice
water
good
night
after
i
went
up
to
my
room
i
looked
out
the
window
it
was
only
about
ten
but
i
looked
upon
a
silent
town
the
drizzle
continued
spangled
with
dim
lights
as
far
apart
as
currants
in
a
cake
sold
at
the
ladies
exchange
a
quiet
place
i
said
to
myself
as
my
first
shoe
struck
the
ceiling
of
the
occupant
of
the
room
beneath
mine
nothing
of
the
life
here
that
gives
color
and
variety
to
the
cities
in
the
east
and
west
just
a
good
ordinary
humdrum
business
town
nashville
occupies
a
foremost
place
among
the
manufacturing
centres
of
the
country
it
is
the
fifth
boot
and
shoe
market
in
the
united
states
the
largest
candy
and
cracker
manufacturing
city
in
the
south
and
does
an
enormous
wholesale
drygoods
grocery
and
drug
business
i
must
tell
you
how
i
came
to
be
in
nashville
and
i
assure
you
the
digression
brings
as
much
tedium
to
me
as
it
does
to
you
i
was
traveling
elsewhere
on
my
own
business
but
i
had
a
commission
from
a
northern
literary
magazine
to
stop
over
there
and
establish
a
personal
connection
between
the
publication
and
one
of
its
contributors
azalea
adair
adair
there
was
no
clue
to
the
personality
except
the
handwriting
had
sent
in
some
essays
lost
art
and
poems
that
had
made
the
editors
swear
approvingly
over
their
one
luncheon
so
they
had
commissioned
me
to
round
up
said
adair
and
corner
by
contract
his
or
her
output
at
two
cents
a
word
before
some
other
publisher
offered
her
ten
or
twenty
at
nine
the
next
morning
after
my
chicken
livers
try
them
if
you
can
find
that
hotel
i
strayed
out
into
the
drizzle
which
was
still
on
for
an
unlimited
run
at
the
first
corner
i
came
upon
uncle
cæsar
he
was
a
stalwart
negro
older
than
the
pyramids
with
gray
wool
and
a
face
that
reminded
me
of
brutus
and
a
second
afterwards
of
the
late
king
cettiwayo
he
wore
the
most
remarkable
coat
that
i
ever
had
seen
or
expect
to
see
it
reached
to
his
ankles
and
had
once
been
a
confederate
gray
in
colors
but
rain
and
sun
and
age
had
so
variegated
it
that
joseph
coat
beside
it
would
have
faded
to
a
pale
monochrome
i
must
linger
with
that
coat
for
it
has
to
do
with
the
story
the
story
that
is
so
long
in
coming
because
you
can
hardly
expect
anything
to
happen
in
nashville
once
it
must
have
been
the
military
coat
of
an
officer
the
cape
of
it
had
vanished
but
all
adown
its
front
it
had
been
frogged
and
tasseled
magnificently
but
now
the
frogs
and
tassles
were
gone
in
their
stead
had
been
patiently
stitched
i
surmised
by
some
surviving
black
mammy
new
frogs
made
of
cunningly
twisted
common
hempen
twine
this
twine
was
frayed
and
disheveled
it
must
have
been
added
to
the
coat
as
a
substitute
for
vanished
splendors
with
tasteless
but
painstaking
devotion
for
it
followed
faithfully
the
curves
of
the
frogs
and
to
complete
the
comedy
and
pathos
of
the
garment
all
its
buttons
were
gone
save
one
the
second
button
from
the
top
alone
remained
the
coat
was
fastened
by
other
twine
strings
tied
through
the
buttonholes
and
other
holes
rudely
pierced
in
the
opposite
side
there
was
never
such
a
weird
garment
so
fantastically
bedecked
and
of
so
many
mottled
hues
the
lone
button
was
the
size
of
a
made
of
yellow
horn
and
sewed
on
with
coarse
twine
this
negro
stood
by
a
carriage
so
old
that
ham
himself
might
have
started
a
hack
line
with
it
after
he
left
the
ark
with
the
two
animals
hitched
to
it
as
i
approached
he
threw
open
the
door
drew
out
a
feather
duster
waved
it
without
using
it
and
said
in
deep
rumbling
tones
step
right
in
suh
ai
a
speck
of
dust
in
it
jus
got
back
from
a
funeral
suh
i
inferred
that
on
such
gala
occasions
carriages
were
given
an
extra
cleaning
i
looked
up
and
down
the
street
and
perceived
that
there
was
little
choice
among
the
vehicles
for
hire
that
lined
the
curb
i
looked
in
my
memorandum
book
for
the
address
of
azalea
adair
i
want
to
go
to
jessamine
street
i
said
and
was
about
to
step
into
the
hack
but
for
an
instant
the
thick
long
arm
of
the
old
negro
barred
me
on
his
massive
and
saturnine
face
a
look
of
sudden
suspicion
and
enmity
flashed
for
a
moment
then
with
quickly
returning
conviction
he
asked
blandishingly
what
are
you
gwine
there
for
boss
what
is
it
to
you
i
asked
a
little
sharply
nothin
suh
jus
nothin
only
it
a
lonesome
kind
of
part
of
town
and
few
folks
ever
has
business
out
there
step
right
in
the
seats
is
clean
jes
got
back
from
a
funeral
suh
a
mile
and
a
half
it
must
have
been
to
our
journey
end
i
could
hear
nothing
but
the
fearful
rattle
of
the
ancient
hack
over
the
uneven
brick
paving
i
could
smell
nothing
but
the
drizzle
now
further
flavored
with
coal
smoke
and
something
like
a
mixture
of
tar
and
oleander
blossoms
all
i
could
see
through
the
streaming
windows
were
two
rows
of
dim
houses
the
city
has
an
area
of
square
miles
miles
of
streets
of
which
miles
are
paved
a
system
of
that
cost
with
miles
of
mains
jessamine
street
was
a
decayed
mansion
thirty
yards
back
from
the
street
it
stood
outmerged
in
a
splendid
grove
of
trees
and
untrimmed
shrubbery
a
row
of
box
bushes
overflowed
and
almost
hid
the
paling
fence
from
sight
the
gate
was
kept
closed
by
a
rope
noose
that
encircled
the
gate
post
and
the
first
paling
of
the
gate
but
when
you
got
inside
you
saw
that
was
a
shell
a
shadow
a
ghost
of
former
grandeur
and
excellence
but
in
the
story
i
have
not
yet
got
inside
when
the
hack
had
ceased
from
rattling
and
the
weary
quadrupeds
came
to
a
rest
i
handed
my
jehu
his
fifty
cents
with
an
additional
quarter
feeling
a
glow
of
conscious
generosity
as
i
did
so
he
refused
it
it
two
dollars
suh
he
said
how
that
i
asked
i
plainly
heard
you
call
out
at
the
hotel
cents
to
any
part
of
the
town
it
two
dollars
suh
he
repeated
obstinately
it
a
long
ways
from
the
hotel
it
is
within
the
city
limits
and
well
within
them
i
argued
think
that
you
have
picked
up
a
greenhorn
yankee
do
you
see
those
hills
over
there
i
went
on
pointing
toward
the
east
i
could
not
see
them
myself
for
the
drizzle
well
i
was
born
and
raised
on
their
other
side
you
old
fool
nigger
ca
you
tell
people
from
other
people
when
you
see
the
grim
face
of
king
cettiwayo
softened
is
you
from
the
south
suh
i
reckon
it
was
them
shoes
of
yourn
fooled
me
they
is
somethin
sharp
in
the
toes
for
a
southern
to
wear
then
the
charge
is
fifty
cents
i
suppose
said
i
inexorably
his
former
expression
a
mingling
of
cupidity
and
hostility
returned
remained
ten
seconds
and
vanished
boss
he
said
fifty
cents
is
right
but
i
two
dollars
suh
i
to
have
two
dollars
i
ai
it
now
suh
after
i
know
whar
you
from
i
jus
sayin
that
i
to
have
two
dollars
and
business
is
mighty
po
peace
and
confidence
settled
upon
his
heavy
features
he
had
been
luckier
than
he
had
hoped
instead
of
having
picked
up
a
greenhorn
ignorant
of
rates
he
had
come
upon
an
inheritance
you
confounded
old
rascal
i
said
reaching
down
to
my
pocket
you
ought
to
be
turned
over
to
the
police
for
the
first
time
i
saw
him
smile
he
knew
he
knew
i
gave
him
two
bills
as
i
handed
them
over
i
noticed
that
one
of
them
had
seen
parlous
times
its
upper
corner
was
missing
and
it
had
been
torn
through
the
middle
but
joined
again
a
strip
of
blue
tissue
paper
pasted
over
the
split
preserved
its
negotiability
enough
of
the
african
bandit
for
the
present
i
left
him
happy
lifted
the
rope
and
opened
a
creaky
gate
the
house
as
i
said
was
a
shell
a
paint
brush
had
not
touched
it
in
twenty
years
i
could
not
see
why
a
strong
wind
should
not
have
bowled
it
over
like
a
house
of
cards
until
i
looked
again
at
the
trees
that
hugged
it
close
the
trees
that
saw
the
battle
of
nashville
and
still
drew
their
protecting
branches
around
it
against
storm
and
enemy
and
cold
azalea
adair
fifty
years
old
a
descendant
of
the
cavaliers
as
thin
and
frail
as
the
house
she
lived
in
robed
in
the
cheapest
and
cleanest
dress
i
ever
saw
with
an
air
as
simple
as
a
queen
received
me
the
reception
room
seemed
a
mile
square
because
there
was
nothing
in
it
except
some
rows
of
books
on
unpainted
bookshelves
a
cracked
table
a
rag
rug
a
hairless
horsehair
sofa
and
two
or
three
chairs
yes
there
was
a
picture
on
the
wall
a
colored
crayon
drawing
of
a
cluster
of
pansies
i
looked
around
for
the
portrait
of
andrew
jackson
and
the
pinecone
hanging
basket
but
they
were
not
there
azalea
adair
and
i
had
conversation
a
little
of
which
will
be
repeated
to
you
she
was
a
product
of
the
old
south
gently
nurtured
in
the
sheltered
life
her
learning
was
not
broad
but
was
deep
and
of
splendid
originality
in
its
somewhat
narrow
scope
she
had
been
educated
at
home
and
her
knowledge
of
the
world
was
derived
from
inference
and
by
inspiration
of
such
is
the
precious
small
group
of
essayists
made
while
she
talked
to
me
i
kept
brushing
my
fingers
trying
unconsciously
to
rid
them
guiltily
of
the
absent
dust
from
the
backs
of
lamb
chaucer
hazlitt
marcus
aurelius
montaigne
and
hood
she
was
exquisite
she
was
a
valuable
discovery
nearly
everybody
nowadays
knows
too
much
oh
so
much
too
much
of
real
life
i
could
perceive
clearly
that
azalea
adair
was
very
poor
a
house
and
a
dress
she
had
not
much
else
i
fancied
so
divided
between
my
duty
to
the
magazine
and
my
loyalty
to
the
poets
and
essayists
who
fought
thomas
in
the
valley
of
the
cumberland
i
listened
to
her
voice
which
was
like
a
harpsichord
and
found
that
i
could
not
speak
of
contracts
in
the
presence
of
the
nine
muses
and
the
three
graces
one
hesitated
to
lower
the
topic
to
two
cents
there
would
have
to
be
another
colloquy
after
i
had
regained
my
commercialism
but
i
spoke
of
my
mission
and
three
of
the
next
afternoon
was
set
for
the
discussion
of
the
business
proposition
your
town
i
said
as
i
began
to
make
ready
to
depart
which
is
the
time
for
smooth
generalities
seems
to
be
a
quiet
sedate
place
a
home
town
i
should
say
where
few
things
out
of
the
ordinary
ever
happen
it
carries
on
an
extensive
trade
in
stoves
and
hollow
ware
with
the
west
and
south
and
its
flouring
mills
have
a
daily
capacity
of
more
than
barrels
azalea
adair
seemed
to
reflect
i
have
never
thought
of
it
that
way
she
said
with
a
kind
of
sincere
intensity
that
seemed
to
belong
to
her
is
it
in
the
still
quiet
places
that
things
do
happen
i
fancy
that
when
god
began
to
create
the
earth
on
the
first
monday
morning
one
could
have
leaned
out
one
window
and
heard
the
drops
of
mud
splashing
from
his
trowel
as
he
built
up
the
everlasting
hills
what
did
the
noisiest
project
in
the
world
i
mean
the
building
of
the
tower
of
babel
result
in
finally
a
page
and
a
half
of
esperanto
in
the
american
of
course
said
i
platitudinously
human
nature
is
the
same
everywhere
but
there
is
more
color
er
more
drama
and
movement
and
er
romance
in
some
cities
than
in
others
on
the
surface
said
azalea
adair
i
have
traveled
many
times
around
the
world
in
a
golden
airship
wafted
on
two
wings
print
and
dreams
i
have
seen
on
one
of
my
imaginary
tours
the
sultan
of
turkey
bowstring
with
his
own
hands
one
of
his
wives
who
had
uncovered
her
face
in
public
i
have
seen
a
man
in
nashville
tear
up
his
theatre
tickets
because
his
wife
was
going
out
with
her
face
covered
with
rice
powder
in
san
francisco
chinatown
i
saw
the
slave
girl
sing
yee
dipped
slowly
inch
by
inch
in
boiling
almond
oil
to
make
her
swear
she
would
never
see
her
american
lover
again
she
gave
in
when
the
boiling
oil
had
reached
three
inches
above
her
knee
at
a
euchre
party
in
east
nashville
the
other
night
i
saw
kitty
morgan
cut
dead
by
seven
of
her
schoolmates
and
lifelong
friends
because
she
had
married
a
house
painter
the
boiling
oil
was
sizzling
as
high
as
her
heart
but
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
fine
little
smile
that
she
carried
from
table
to
table
oh
yes
it
is
a
humdrum
town
just
a
few
miles
of
red
brick
houses
and
mud
and
lumber
yards
some
one
knocked
hollowly
at
the
back
of
the
house
azalea
adair
breathed
a
soft
apology
and
went
to
investigate
the
sound
she
came
back
in
three
minutes
with
brightened
eyes
a
faint
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
ten
years
lifted
from
her
shoulders
you
must
have
a
cup
of
tea
before
you
go
she
said
and
a
sugar
cake
she
reached
and
shook
a
little
iron
bell
in
shuffled
a
small
negro
girl
about
twelve
barefoot
not
very
tidy
glowering
at
me
with
thumb
in
mouth
and
bulging
eyes
azalea
adair
opened
a
tiny
worn
purse
and
drew
out
a
dollar
bill
a
dollar
bill
with
the
upper
corner
missing
torn
in
two
pieces
and
pasted
together
again
with
a
strip
of
blue
tissue
paper
it
was
one
of
the
bills
i
had
given
the
piratical
negro
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
go
up
to
baker
store
on
the
corner
impy
she
said
handing
the
girl
the
dollar
bill
and
get
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
tea
the
kind
he
always
sends
me
and
ten
cents
worth
of
sugar
cakes
now
hurry
the
supply
of
tea
in
the
house
happens
to
be
exhausted
she
explained
to
me
impy
left
by
the
back
way
before
the
scrape
of
her
hard
bare
feet
had
died
away
on
the
back
porch
a
wild
shriek
i
was
sure
it
was
hers
filled
the
hollow
house
then
the
deep
gruff
tones
of
an
angry
man
voice
mingled
with
the
girl
further
squeals
and
unintelligible
words
azalea
adair
rose
without
surprise
or
emotion
and
disappeared
for
two
minutes
i
heard
the
hoarse
rumble
of
the
man
voice
then
something
like
an
oath
and
a
slight
scuffle
and
she
returned
calmly
to
her
chair
this
is
a
roomy
house
she
said
and
i
have
a
tenant
for
part
of
it
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
rescind
my
invitation
to
tea
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
kind
i
always
use
at
the
store
perhaps
baker
will
be
able
to
supply
me
i
was
sure
that
impy
had
not
had
time
to
leave
the
house
i
inquired
concerning
lines
and
took
my
leave
after
i
was
well
on
my
way
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
learned
azalea
adair
name
but
would
do
that
same
day
i
started
in
on
the
course
of
iniquity
that
this
uneventful
city
forced
upon
me
i
was
in
the
town
only
two
days
but
in
that
time
i
managed
to
lie
shamelessly
by
telegraph
and
to
be
an
accomplice
after
the
fact
if
that
is
the
correct
legal
term
to
a
murder
as
i
rounded
the
corner
nearest
my
hotel
the
afrite
coachman
of
the
polychromatic
nonpareil
coat
seized
me
swung
open
the
dungeony
door
of
his
peripatetic
sarcophagus
flirted
his
feather
duster
and
began
his
ritual
step
right
in
boss
carriage
is
clean
jus
got
back
from
a
funeral
fifty
cents
to
any
and
then
he
knew
me
and
grinned
broadly
me

with
me
dis
mawnin
thank
you

three
said
i
and
if

let

drive
me
so
you
know
miss
adair
i
concluded
thinking
of
my
dollar
bill
i
belonged
to
her
father
judge
adair
suh
he
replied
i
judge
that
she
is
pretty
poor
i
said
she
has
much
money
to
speak
of
has
she
for
an
instant
i
looked
again
at
the
fierce
countenance
of
king
cettiwayo
and
then
he
changed
back
to
an
extortionate
old
negro
hack
driver
she
ai
gwine
to
starve
suh
he
said
slowly
she
has
suh
she
has
i
shall
pay
you
fifty
cents
for
the
trip
said
i
dat
is
puffeckly
correct
suh
he
answered
humbly
i
jus
to
have
dat
two
dollars
dis
mawnin
boss
i
went
to
the
hotel
and
lied
by
electricity
i
wired
the
magazine
adair
holds
out
for
eight
cents
a
word
the
answer
that
came
back
was
give
it
to
her
quick
you
duffer
just
before
dinner
major
wentworth
caswell
bore
down
upon
me
with
the
greetings
of
a
friend
i
have
seen
few
men
whom
i
have
so
instantaneously
hated
and
of
whom
it
was
so
difficult
to
be
rid
i
was
standing
at
the
bar
when
he
invaded
me
therefore
i
could
not
wave
the
white
ribbon
in
his
face
i
would
have
paid
gladly
for
the
drinks
hoping
thereby
to
escape
another
but
he
was
one
of
those
despicable
roaring
advertising
bibbers
who
must
have
brass
bands
and
fireworks
attend
upon
every
cent
that
they
waste
in
their
follies
with
an
air
of
producing
millions
he
drew
two
bills
from
a
pocket
and
dashed
one
of
them
upon
the
bar
i
looked
once
more
at
the
dollar
bill
with
the
upper
corner
missing
torn
through
the
middle
and
patched
with
a
strip
of
blue
tissue
paper
it
was
my
dollar
bill
again
it
could
have
been
no
other
i
went
up
to
my
room
the
drizzle
and
the
monotony
of
a
dreary
eventless
southern
town
had
made
me
tired
and
listless
i
remember
that
just
before
i
went
to
bed
i
mentally
disposed
of
the
mysterious
dollar
bill
which
might
have
formed
the
clew
to
a
tremendously
fine
detective
story
of
san
francisco
by
saying
to
myself
sleepily
seems
as
if
a
lot
of
people
here
own
stock
in
the
trust
pays
dividends
promptly
too
wonder
if
then
i
fell
asleep
king
cettiwayo
was
at
his
post
the
next
day
and
rattled
my
bones
over
the
stones
out
to
he
was
to
wait
and
rattle
me
back
again
when
i
was
ready
azalea
adair
looked
paler
and
cleaner
and
frailer
than
she
had
looked
on
the
day
before
after
she
had
signed
the
contract
at
eight
cents
per
word
she
grew
still
paler
and
began
to
slip
out
of
her
chair
without
much
trouble
i
managed
to
get
her
up
on
the
antediluvian
horsehair
sofa
and
then
i
ran
out
to
the
sidewalk
and
yelled
to
the
pirate
to
bring
a
doctor
with
a
wisdom
that
i
had
not
expected
in
him
he
abandoned
his
team
and
struck
off
up
the
street
afoot
realizing
the
value
of
speed
in
ten
minutes
he
returned
with
a
grave
and
capable
man
of
medicine
in
a
few
words
worth
much
less
than
eight
cents
each
i
explained
to
him
my
presence
in
the
hollow
house
of
mystery
he
bowed
with
stately
understanding
and
turned
to
the
old
negro
uncle
cæsar
he
said
calmly
run
up
to
my
house
and
ask
miss
lucy
to
give
you
a
cream
pitcher
full
of
fresh
milk
and
half
a
tumbler
of
port
wine
and
hurry
back
do
drive
run
i
want
you
to
get
back
sometime
this
week
it
occurred
to
me
that
merriman
also
felt
a
distrust
as
to
the
speeding
powers
of
the
steeds
after
uncle
cæsar
was
gone
lumberingly
but
swiftly
up
the
street
the
doctor
looked
me
over
with
great
politeness
and
as
much
careful
calculation
until
he
had
decided
that
i
might
do
it
is
only
a
case
of
insufficient
nutrition
he
said
in
other
words
the
result
of
poverty
pride
and
starvation
caswell
has
many
devoted
friends
who
would
be
glad
to
aid
her
but
she
will
accept
nothing
except
from
that
old
negro
uncle
cæsar
who
was
once
owned
by
her
family
mrs
caswell
said
i
in
surprise
and
then
i
looked
at
the
contract
and
saw
that
she
had
signed
it
azalea
adair
caswell
i
thought
she
was
miss
adair
i
said
married
to
a
drunken
worthless
loafer
sir
said
the
doctor
it
is
said
that
he
robs
her
even
of
the
small
sums
that
her
old
servant
contributes
toward
her
support
when
the
milk
and
wine
had
been
brought
the
doctor
soon
revived
azalea
adair
she
sat
up
and
talked
of
the
beauty
of
the
autumn
leaves
that
were
then
in
season
and
their
height
of
color
she
referred
lightly
to
her
fainting
seizure
as
the
outcome
of
an
old
palpitation
of
the
heart
impy
fanned
her
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
the
doctor
was
due
elsewhere
and
i
followed
him
to
the
door
i
told
him
that
it
was
within
my
power
and
intentions
to
make
a
reasonable
advance
of
money
to
azalea
adair
on
future
contributions
to
the
magazine
and
he
seemed
pleased
by
the
way
he
said
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
that
you
have
had
royalty
for
a
coachman
old
cæsar
grandfather
was
a
king
in
congo
cæsar
himself
has
royal
ways
as
you
may
have
observed
as
the
doctor
was
moving
off
i
heard
uncle
cæsar
voice
inside
did
he
get
bofe
of
dem
two
dollars
from
you
mis
zalea
yes
cæsar
i
heard
azalea
adair
answer
weakly
and
then
i
went
in
and
concluded
business
negotiations
with
our
contributor
i
assumed
the
responsibility
of
advancing
fifty
dollars
putting
it
as
a
necessary
formality
in
binding
our
bargain
and
then
uncle
cæsar
drove
me
back
to
the
hotel
here
ends
all
of
the
story
as
far
as
i
can
testify
as
a
witness
the
rest
must
be
only
bare
statements
of
facts
at
about
six
i
went
out
for
a
stroll
uncle
cæsar
was
at
his
corner
he
threw
open
the
door
of
his
carriage
flourished
his
duster
and
began
his
depressing
formula
step
right
in
suh
fifty
cents
to
anywhere
in
the
city
hack
puffickly
clean
suh
jus
got
back
from
a
funeral
and
then
he
recognized
me
i
think
his
eyesight
was
getting
bad
his
coat
had
taken
on
a
few
more
faded
shades
of
color
the
twine
strings
were
more
frayed
and
ragged
the
last
remaining
button
the
button
of
yellow
horn
was
gone
a
motley
descendant
of
kings
was
uncle
cæsar
about
two
hours
later
i
saw
an
excited
crowd
besieging
the
front
of
a
drug
store
in
a
desert
where
nothing
happens
this
was
manna
so
i
wedged
my
way
inside
on
an
extemporized
couch
of
empty
boxes
and
chairs
was
stretched
the
mortal
corporeality
of
major
wentworth
caswell
a
doctor
was
testing
him
for
the
immortal
ingredient
his
decision
was
that
it
was
conspicuous
by
its
absence
the
erstwhile
major
had
been
found
dead
on
a
dark
street
and
brought
by
curious
and
ennuied
citizens
to
the
drug
store
the
late
human
being
had
been
engaged
in
terrific
battle
the
details
showed
that
loafer
and
reprobate
though
he
had
been
he
had
been
also
a
warrior
but
he
had
lost
his
hands
were
yet
clinched
so
tightly
that
his
fingers
would
not
be
opened
the
gentle
citizens
who
had
know
him
stood
about
and
searched
their
vocabularies
to
find
some
good
words
if
it
were
possible
to
speak
of
him
one
man
said
after
much
thought
when
was
about
he
was
one
of
the
best
spellers
in
school
while
i
stood
there
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
of
the
man
that
was
which
hung
down
the
side
of
a
white
pine
box
relaxed
and
dropped
something
at
my
feet
i
covered
it
with
one
foot
quietly
and
a
little
later
on
i
picked
it
up
and
pocketed
it
i
reasoned
that
in
his
last
struggle
his
hand
must
have
seized
that
object
unwittingly
and
held
it
in
a
death
grip
at
the
hotel
that
night
the
main
topic
of
conversation
with
the
possible
exceptions
of
politics
and
prohibition
was
the
demise
of
major
caswell
i
heard
one
man
say
to
a
group
of
listeners
in
my
opinion
gentlemen
caswell
was
murdered
by
some
of
these
niggers
for
his
money
he
had
fifty
dollars
this
afternoon
which
he
showed
to
several
gentlemen
in
the
hotel
when
he
was
found
the
money
was
not
on
his
person
i
left
the
city
the
next
morning
at
nine
and
as
the
train
was
crossing
the
bridge
over
the
cumberland
river
i
took
out
of
my
pocket
a
yellow
horn
overcoat
button
the
size
of
a
piece
with
frayed
ends
of
coarse
twine
hanging
from
it
and
cast
it
out
of
the
window
into
the
slow
muddy
waters
below
wonder
what
doing
in
buffalo
xiv
psyche
and
the
pskyscraper
if
you
are
a
philosopher
you
can
do
this
thing
you
can
go
to
the
top
of
a
high
building
look
down
upon
your
feet
below
and
despise
them
as
insects
like
the
irresponsible
black
waterbugs
on
summer
ponds
they
crawl
and
circle
and
hustle
about
idiotically
without
aim
or
purpose
they
do
not
even
move
with
the
admirable
intelligence
of
ants
for
ants
always
know
when
they
are
going
home
the
ant
is
of
a
lowly
station
but
he
will
often
reach
home
and
get
his
slippers
on
while
you
are
left
at
your
elevated
station
man
then
to
the
housetopped
philosopher
appears
to
be
but
a
creeping
contemptible
beetle
brokers
poets
millionaires
bootblacks
beauties
and
politicians
become
little
black
specks
dodging
bigger
black
specks
in
streets
no
wider
than
your
thumb
from
this
high
view
the
city
itself
becomes
degraded
to
an
unintelligible
mass
of
distorted
buildings
and
impossible
perspectives
the
revered
ocean
is
a
duck
pond
the
earth
itself
a
lost
golf
ball
all
the
minutiae
of
life
are
gone
the
philosopher
gazes
into
the
infinite
heavens
above
him
and
allows
his
soul
to
expand
to
the
influence
of
his
new
view
he
feels
that
he
is
the
heir
to
eternity
and
the
child
of
time
space
too
should
be
his
by
the
right
of
his
immortal
heritage
and
he
thrills
at
the
thought
that
some
day
his
kind
shall
traverse
those
mysterious
aerial
roads
between
planet
and
planet
the
tiny
world
beneath
his
feet
upon
which
this
towering
structure
of
steel
rests
as
a
speck
of
dust
upon
a
himalayan
mountain
it
is
but
one
of
a
countless
number
of
such
whirling
atoms
what
are
the
ambitions
the
achievements
the
paltry
conquests
and
loves
of
those
restless
black
insects
below
compared
with
the
serene
and
awful
immensity
of
the
universe
that
lies
above
and
around
their
insignificant
city
it
is
guaranteed
that
the
philosopher
will
have
these
thoughts
they
have
been
expressly
compiled
from
the
philosophies
of
the
world
and
set
down
with
the
proper
interrogation
point
at
the
end
of
them
to
represent
the
invariable
musings
of
deep
thinkers
on
high
places
and
when
the
philosopher
takes
the
elevator
down
his
mind
is
broader
his
heart
is
at
peace
and
his
conception
of
the
cosmogony
of
creation
is
as
wide
as
the
buckle
of
orion
summer
belt
but
if
your
name
happened
to
be
daisy
and
you
worked
in
an
eighth
avenue
candy
store
and
lived
in
a
little
cold
hall
bedroom
five
feet
by
eight
and
earned
per
week
and
ate
lunches
and
were
nineteen
years
old
and
got
up
at
and
worked
till
and
never
had
studied
philosophy
maybe
things
would
look
that
way
to
you
from
the
top
of
a
skyscraper
two
sighed
for
the
hand
of
daisy
the
unphilosophical
one
was
joe
who
kept
the
smallest
store
in
new
york
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
of
the
and
was
stuck
like
a
swallow
nest
against
a
corner
of
a
skyscraper
its
stock
consisted
of
fruit
candies
newspapers
song
books
cigarettes
and
lemonade
in
season
when
stern
winter
shook
his
congealed
locks
and
joe
had
to
move
himself
and
the
fruit
inside
there
was
exactly
room
in
the
store
for
the
proprietor
his
wares
a
stove
the
size
of
a
vinegar
cruet
and
one
customer
joe
was
not
of
the
nation
that
keeps
us
forever
in
a
furore
with
fugues
and
fruit
he
was
a
capable
american
youth
who
was
laying
by
money
and
wanted
daisy
to
help
him
spend
it
three
times
he
had
asked
her
i
got
money
saved
up
daisy
was
his
love
song
and
you
know
how
bad
i
want
you
that
store
of
mine
ai
very
big
but
oh
ai
it
would
be
the
antiphony
of
the
unphilosophical
one
why
i
heard
wanamaker
was
trying
to
get
you
to
sublet
part
of
your
floor
space
to
them
for
next
year
daisy
passed
joe
corner
every
morning
and
evening
hello
was
her
usual
greeting
seems
to
me
your
store
looks
emptier
you
must
have
sold
a
pack
of
chewing
gum
ai
much
room
in
here
sure
joe
would
answer
with
his
slow
grin
except
for
you
daise
me
and
the
store
are
waitin
for
you
whenever
you
take
us
do
you
think
you
might
before
long
store
a
fine
scorn
was
expressed
by
daisy
uptilted
nose
sardine
box
waitin
for
me
you
say
gee
you
have
to
throw
out
about
a
hundred
pounds
of
candy
before
i
could
get
inside
of
it
joe
i
would
mind
an
even
swap
like
that
said
joe
complimentary
daisy
existence
was
limited
in
every
way
she
had
to
walk
sideways
between
the
counter
and
the
shelves
in
the
candy
store
in
her
own
hall
bedroom
coziness
had
been
carried
close
to
cohesiveness
the
walls
were
so
near
to
one
another
that
the
paper
on
them
made
a
perfect
babel
of
noise
she
could
light
the
gas
with
one
hand
and
close
the
door
with
the
other
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
reflection
of
her
brown
pompadour
in
the
mirror
she
had
joe
picture
in
a
gilt
frame
on
the
dresser
and
sometimes
but
her
next
thought
would
always
be
of
joe
funny
little
store
tacked
like
a
soap
box
to
the
corner
of
that
great
building
and
away
would
go
her
sentiment
in
a
breeze
of
laughter
daisy
other
suitor
followed
joe
by
several
months
he
came
to
board
in
the
house
where
she
lived
his
name
was
dabster
and
he
was
a
philosopher
though
young
attainments
stood
out
upon
him
like
continental
labels
on
a
passaic
n
j
knowledge
he
had
kidnapped
from
cyclopedias
and
handbooks
of
useful
information
but
as
for
wisdom
when
she
passed
he
was
left
sniffling
in
the
road
without
so
much
as
the
number
of
her
motor
car
he
could
and
would
tell
you
the
proportion
of
water
and
properties
of
peas
and
veal
the
shortest
verse
in
the
bible
the
number
of
pounds
of
shingle
nails
required
to
fasten
shingles
laid
four
inches
to
the
weather
the
population
of
kankakee
the
theories
of
spinoza
the
name
of
mckay
twombly
second
hall
footman
the
length
of
the
hoosac
tunnel
the
best
time
to
set
a
hen
the
salary
of
the
railway
messenger
between
driftwood
and
red
bank
furnace
and
the
number
of
bones
in
the
foreleg
of
a
cat
the
weight
of
learning
was
no
handicap
to
dabster
his
statistics
were
the
sprigs
of
parsley
with
which
he
garnished
the
feast
of
small
talk
that
he
would
set
before
you
if
he
conceived
that
to
be
your
taste
and
again
he
used
them
as
breastworks
in
foraging
at
the
boardinghouse
firing
at
you
a
volley
of
figures
concerning
the
weight
of
a
lineal
foot
of
x
inches
and
the
average
annual
rainfall
at
fort
snelling
he
would
transfix
with
his
fork
the
best
piece
of
chicken
on
the
dish
while
you
were
trying
to
rally
sufficiently
to
ask
him
weakly
why
does
a
hen
cross
the
road
thus
brightly
armed
and
further
equipped
with
a
measure
of
good
looks
of
a
kind
it
seems
that
joe
of
the
lilliputian
emporium
had
a
rival
worthy
of
his
steel
but
joe
carried
no
steel
there
would
have
been
room
in
his
store
to
draw
it
if
he
had
one
saturday
afternoon
about
four
daisy
and
dabster
stopped
before
joe
booth
dabster
wore
a
silk
hat
and
well
daisy
was
a
woman
and
that
hat
had
no
chance
to
get
back
in
its
box
until
joe
had
seen
it
a
stick
of
pineapple
chewing
gum
was
the
ostensible
object
of
the
call
joe
supplied
it
through
the
open
side
of
his
store
he
did
not
pale
or
falter
at
sight
of
the
hat
dabster
going
to
take
me
on
top
of
the
building
to
observe
the
view
said
daisy
after
she
had
introduced
her
admirers
i
never
was
on
a
skyscraper
i
guess
it
must
be
awfully
nice
and
funny
up
there
h
said
joe
the
panorama
said
dabster
exposed
to
the
gaze
from
the
top
of
a
lofty
building
is
not
only
sublime
but
instructive
miss
daisy
has
a
decided
pleasure
in
store
for
her
it
windy
up
there
too
as
well
as
here
said
joe
are
you
dressed
warm
enough
daise
sure
thing
i
all
lined
said
daisy
smiling
slyly
at
his
clouded
brow
you
look
just
like
a
mummy
in
a
case
joe
ai
you
just
put
in
an
invoice
of
a
pint
of
peanuts
or
another
apple
your
stock
looks
awful
daisy
giggled
at
her
favorite
joke
and
joe
had
to
smile
with
her
your
quarters
are
somewhat
limited
er
er
remarked
dabster
in
comparison
with
the
size
of
this
building
i
understand
the
area
of
its
side
to
be
about
by
feet
that
would
make
you
occupy
a
proportionate
space
as
if
half
of
beloochistan
were
placed
upon
a
territory
as
large
as
the
united
states
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
with
the
province
of
ontario
and
belgium
added
is
that
so
sport
said
joe
genially
you
are
weisenheimer
on
figures
all
right
how
many
square
pounds
of
baled
hay
do
you
think
a
jackass
could
eat
if
he
stopped
brayin
long
enough
to
keep
still
a
minute
and
five
eighths
a
few
minutes
later
daisy
and
dabster
stepped
from
an
elevator
to
the
top
floor
of
the
skyscraper
then
up
a
short
steep
stairway
and
out
upon
the
roof
dabster
led
her
to
the
parapet
so
she
could
look
down
at
the
black
dots
moving
in
the
street
below
what
are
they
she
asked
trembling
she
had
never
been
on
a
height
like
this
before
and
then
dabster
must
needs
play
the
philosopher
on
the
tower
and
conduct
her
soul
forth
to
meet
the
immensity
of
space
bipeds
he
said
solemnly
see
what
they
become
even
at
the
small
elevation
of
feet
mere
crawling
insects
going
to
and
fro
at
random
oh
they
ai
anything
of
the
kind
exclaimed
daisy
suddenly
they
folks
i
saw
an
automobile
oh
gee
are
we
that
high
up
walk
over
this
way
said
dabster
he
showed
her
the
great
city
lying
like
an
orderly
array
of
toys
far
below
starred
here
and
there
early
as
it
was
by
the
first
beacon
lights
of
the
winter
afternoon
and
then
the
bay
and
sea
to
the
south
and
east
vanishing
mysteriously
into
the
sky
i
do
like
it
declared
daisy
with
troubled
blue
eyes
say
we
go
down
but
the
philosopher
was
not
to
be
denied
his
opportunity
he
would
let
her
behold
the
grandeur
of
his
mind
the
he
had
on
the
infinite

the

had
for
statistics
and
then
she
would
nevermore
be
content
to
buy
chewing
gum
at
the
smallest
store
in
new
york
and
so
he
began
to
prate
of
the
smallness
of
human
affairs
and
how
that
even
so
slight
a
removal
from
earth
made
man
and
his
works
look
like
one
tenth
part
of
a
dollar
thrice
computed
and
that
one
should
consider
the
sidereal
system
and
the
maxims
of
epictetus
and
be
comforted
you
do
carry
me
with
you
said
daisy
say
i
think
it
awful
to
be
up
so
high
that
folks
look
like
fleas
one
of
them
we
saw
might
have
been
joe
why
jiminy
we
might
as
well
be
in

say
afraid
up
here
the
philosopher
smiled
fatuously
the
earth
said
he
is
itself
only
as
a
grain
of
wheat
in

look
up
there
daisy
gazed
upward
apprehensively
the
short
day
was
spent
and
the
stars
were
coming
out
above
yonder
star
said
dabster
is
venus
the

star
she
is
miles
from

fudge
said
daisy
with
a
brief
flash
of
spirit
where
do
you
think
i
come
from
brooklyn
susie
price
in
our
store
her
brother
sent
her
a
ticket
to
go
to
san
francisco
that
only
three
thousand
miles
the
philosopher
smiled
indulgently
our
world
he
said
is
miles
from
the
sun
there
are
eighteen
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
that
are
times
further
from
us
than
the
sun
is
if
one
of
them
should
be
extinguished
it
would
be
three
years
before
we
would
see
its
light
go
out
there
are
six
thousand
stars
of
the
sixth
magnitude
it
takes
years
for
the
light
of
one
of
them
to
reach
the
earth
with
an
telescope
we
can
see
stars
including
those
of
the
thirteenth
magnitude
whose
light
takes
years
to
reach
us
each
of
these
stars
you
lyin
cried
daisy
angrily
you
tryin
to
scare
me
and
you
have
i
want
to
go
down
she
stamped
her
foot
arcturus
began
the
philosopher
soothingly
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
demonstration
out
of
the
vastness
of
the
nature
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
portray
with
his
memory
instead
of
his
heart
for
to
the
of
nature
the
stars
were
set
in
the
firmament
expressly
to
give
soft
light
to
lovers
wandering
happily
beneath
them
and
if
you
stand
tiptoe
some
september
night
with
your
sweetheart
on
your
arm
you
can
almost
touch
them
with
your
hand
three
years
for
their
light
to
reach
us
indeed
out
of
the
west
leaped
a
meteor
lighting
the
roof
of
the
skyscraper
almost
to
midday
its
fiery
parabola
was
limned
against
the
sky
toward
the
east
it
hissed
as
it
went
and
daisy
screamed
take
me
down
she
cried
vehemently
you
you
mental
arithmetic
dabster
got
her
to
the
elevator
and
inside
of
it
she
was
and
she
shuddered
when
the
express
made
its
debilitating
drop
outside
the
revolving
door
of
the
skyscraper
the
philosopher
lost
her
she
vanished
and
he
stood
bewildered
without
figures
or
statistics
to
aid
him
joe
had
a
lull
in
trade
and
by
squirming
among
his
stock
succeeded
in
lighting
a
cigarette
and
getting
one
cold
foot
against
the
attenuated
stove
the
door
was
burst
open
and
daisy
laughing
crying
scattering
fruit
and
candies
tumbled
into
his
arms
oh
joe
i

up
on

the

in

quigg
title
came
through
his
mother
one
of
her
ancestors
was
a
margravine
of
saxony
his
father
was
a
tammany
brave
on
account
of
the
dilution
of
his
heredity
he
found
that
he
could
neither
become
a
reigning
potentate
nor
get
a
job
in
the
city
hall
so
he
opened
a
restaurant
he
was
a
man
full
of
thought
and
reading
the
business
gave
him
a
living
though
he
gave
it
little
attention
one
side
of
his
house
bequeathed
to
him
a
poetic
and
romantic
adventure
the
other
gave
him
the
restless
spirit
that
made
him
seek
adventure
by
day
he
was
quigg
the
restaurateur
by
night
he
was
the
margrave
the
caliph
the
prince
of
bohemia
going
about
the
city
in
search
of
the
odd
the
mysterious
the
inexplicable
the
recondite
one
night
at
at
which
hour
the
restaurant
closed
quigg
set
forth
upon
his
quest
there
was
a
mingling
of
the
foreign
the
military
and
the
artistic
in
his
appearance
as
he
buttoned
his
coat
high
up
under
his
brown
and
gray
beard
and
turned
westward
toward
the
more
central
life
conduits
of
the
city
in
his
pocket
he
had
stored
an
assortment
of
cards
written
upon
without
which
he
never
stirred
out
of
doors
each
of
those
cards
was
good
at
his
own
restaurant
for
its
face
value
some
called
simply
for
a
bowl
of
soup
or
sandwiches
and
coffee
others
entitled
their
bearer
to
one

or
more
days
of
full
meals
a

were
for

regular

a
very
few
were
in

meal
tickets
good
for
a
week
of
riches
and
power
margrave
quigg
had
none
but
he
had
a
heart
it
may
be
forgiven
him
if
his
head
fell
short
of
the
measure
of
harun
al
rashid
perhaps
some
of
the
gold
pieces
in
bagdad
had
put
less
warmth
and
hope
into
the
complainants
among
the
bazaars
than
had
quigg
beef
stew
among
the
fishermen
and
calenders
of
manhattan
continuing
his
progress
in
search
of
romance
to
divert
him
or
of
distress
that
he
might
aid
quigg
became
aware
of
a
crowd
that
whooped
and
fought
and
eddied
at
a
corner
of
broadway
and
the
crosstown
street
that
he
was
traversing
hurrying
to
the
spot
he
beheld
a
young
man
of
an
exceedingly
melancholy
and
preoccupied
demeanor
engaged
in
the
pastime
of
casting
silver
money
from
his
pockets
in
the
middle
of
the
street
with
each
motion
of
the
generous
one
hand
the
crowd
huddled
upon
the
falling
largesse
with
yells
of
joy
traffic
was
suspended
a
policeman
in
the
centre
of
the
mob
stooped
often
to
the
ground
as
he
urged
the
blockaders
to
move
on
the
margrave
saw
at
a
glance
that
here
was
food
for
his
hunger
after
knowledge
concerning
abnormal
working
of
the
human
heart
he
made
his
way
swiftly
to
the
young
man
side
and
took
his
arm
come
with
me
at
once
he
said
in
the
low
but
commanding
voice
that
his
waiters
had
learned
to
fear
pinched
remarked
the
young
man
looking
up
at
him
with
expressionless
eyes
pinched
by
a
painless
dentist
take
me
away
flatty
and
give
me
gas
some
lay
eggs
and
some
lay
none
when
is
a
hen
still
deeply
seized
by
some
inward
grief
but
tractable
he
allowed
quigg
to
lead
him
away
and
down
the
street
to
a
little
park
there
seated
on
a
bench
he
upon
whom
a
corner
of
the
great
mantle
has
descended
spake
with
kindness
and
discretion
seeking
to
know
what
evil
had
come
upon
the
other
disturbing
his
soul
and
driving
him
to
such
and
ruinous
waste
of
his
substance
and
stores
i
was
doing
the
monte
cristo
act
as
adapted
by
pompton
i
asked
the
young
man
you
were
throwing
small
coins
into
the
street
for
the
people
to
scramble
after
said
the
margrave
that
it
you
buy
all
the
beer
you
can
hold
and
then
you
throw
chicken
feed
to
oh
curse
that
word
chicken
and
hens
feathers
roosters
eggs
and
everything
connected
with
it
young
sir
said
the
margrave
kindly
but
with
dignity
though
i
do
not
ask
your
confidence
i
invite
it
i
know
the
world
and
i
know
humanity
man
is
my
study
though
i
do
not
eye
him
as
the
scientist
eyes
a
beetle
or
as
the
philanthropist
gazes
at
the
objects
of
his
bounty
through
a
veil
of
theory
and
ignorance
it
is
my
pleasure
and
distraction
to
interest
myself
in
the
peculiar
and
complicated
misfortunes
that
life
in
a
great
city
visits
upon
my
you
may
be
familiar
with
the
history
of
that
glorious
and
immortal
ruler
the
caliph
harun
al
rashid
whose
wise
and
beneficent
excursions
among
his
people
in
the
city
of
bagdad
secured
him
the
privilege
of
relieving
so
much
of
their
distress
in
my
humble
way
i
walk
in
his
footsteps
i
seek
for
romance
and
adventure
in
city
streets
not
in
ruined
castles
or
in
crumbling
palaces
to
me
the
greatest
marvels
of
magic
are
those
that
take
place
in
men
hearts
when
acted
upon
by
the
furious
and
diverse
forces
of
a
crowded
population
in
your
strange
behavior
this
evening
i
fancy
a
story
lurks
i
read
in
your
act
something
deeper
than
the
wanton
wastefulness
of
a
spendthrift
i
observe
in
your
countenance
the
certain
traces
of
consuming
grief
or
despair
i
repeat
i
invite
your
confidence
i
am
not
without
some
power
to
alleviate
and
advise
will
you
not
trust
me
gee
how
you
talk
exclaimed
the
young
man
a
gleam
of
admiration
supplanting
for
a
moment
the
dull
sadness
of
his
eyes
you
got
the
astor
library
skinned
to
a
synopsis
of
preceding
chapters
i
mind
that
old
turk
you
speak
of

read
arabian
nights
when
i
was
a
kid
he
was
a
kind
of
bill
devery
and
charlie
schwab
rolled
into
one
but
say
you
might
wave
enchanted
dishrags
and
make
copper
bottles
smoke
up
coon
giants
all
night
without
ever
touching
me
my
case
wo
yield
to
that
kind
of
treatment

could
hear

story

the
margrave
with
his
lofty
serious
smile
i
spiel
it
in
about
nine
words
said
the
young
man
with
a
deep
sigh
but

libraries
in
bagdad
well
now
can
you
whistle
up
a
fairy
that
solve
this
hen
query
or
not
when
the
young
man
ceased
the
margrave
arose
and
paced
to
and
fro
by
the
park
bench
for
several
minutes
finally
he
sat
again
and
said
in
grave
and
impressive
tones
i
must
confess
sir
that
during
the
eight
years
that
i
have
spent
in
search
of
adventure
and
in
relieving
distress
i
have
never
encountered
a
more
interesting
or
a
more
perplexing
case
i
fear
that
i
have
overlooked
hens
in
my
researches
and
observations
as
to
their
habits
their

flippantly
riddles
especially
old
hildebrant
riddles

have
to
be
worked
out
seriously
they
are
light
themes
such
as

your

i
glad
anyhow
that
you
butted

guess
al

bounced
back

one

conducted
him
up

this

the

still
with
a
gloomy

held
out
his
hand
i
can
not
express
my
regret
he
said
sadly
never
before
have
i
found
myself
unable
to
assist
in
some
way
kind
of
a

the

it
is
a
baffling

there
is
a

said
the

well
good

your

the

began
to
fumble
in
his
pockets
he
drew
forth
a
card
and
handed
it
to
the
young
man
do
me
the
favor
to
accept
this
anyhow
he
said
the
time
may
come
when
it
might
be
of
use
to
you
thanks
said
the
young
man
pocketing
it
carelessly

encountered
the

touch
of

xvi
compliments
of
the
season
there
are
no
more
christmas
stories
to
write
fiction
is
exhausted
and
newspaper
items
the
next
best
are
manufactured
by
clever
young
journalists
who
have
married
early
and
have
an
engagingly
pessimistic
view
of
life
therefore
for
seasonable
diversion
we
are
reduced
to
very
questionable
sources
facts
and
philosophy
we
will
begin
with
whichever
you
choose
to
call
it
children
are
pestilential
little
animals
with
which
we
have
to
cope
under
a
bewildering
variety
of
conditions
especially
when
childish
sorrows
overwhelm
them
are
we
put
to
our
wits
end
we
exhaust
our
paltry
store
of
consolation
and
then
beat
them
sobbing
to
sleep
then
we
grovel
in
the
dust
of
a
million
years
and
ask
god
why
thus
we
call
out
of
the
as
for
the
children
no
one
understands
them
except
old
maids
hunchbacks
and
shepherd
dogs
now
comes
the
facts
in
the
case
of
the
the
tatterdemalion
and
the
of
december
on
the
tenth
of
that
month
the
child
of
the
millionaire
lost
her
there
were
many
servants
in
the
millionaire
palace
on
the
hudson
and
these
ransacked
the
house
and
grounds
but
without
finding
the
lost
treasure
the
child
was
a
girl
of
five
and
one
of
those
perverse
little
beasts
that
often
wound
the
sensibilities
of
wealthy
parents
by
fixing
their
affections
upon
some
vulgar
inexpensive
toy
instead
of
upon
automobiles
and
pony
phaetons
the
child
grieved
sorely
and
truly
a
thing
inexplicable
to
the
millionaire
to
whom
the
market
was
about
as
interesting
as
bay
state
gas
and
to
the
lady
the
child
mother
who
was
all
form
that
is
nearly
all
as
you
shall
see
the
child
cried
inconsolably
and
grew
spindling
and
corykilverty
in
many
other
respects
the
millionaire
smiled
and
tapped
his
coffers
confidently
the
pick
of
the
output
of
the
french
and
german
toymakers
was
rushed
by
special
delivery
to
the
mansion
but
rachel
refused
to
be
comforted
she
was
weeping
for
her
rag
child
and
was
for
a
high
protective
tariff
against
all
foreign
foolishness
then
doctors
with
the
finest
bedside
manners
and
were
called
in
one
by
one
they
chattered
futilely
about
peptomanganate
of
iron
and
sea
voyages
and
hypophosphites
until
their
showed
that
bill
rendered
was
under
the
wire
for
show
or
place
then
as
men
they
advised
that
the
be
found
as
soon
as
possible
and
restored
to
its
mourning
parent
the
child
sniffed
at
therapeutics
chewed
a
thumb
and
wailed
for
her
betsy
and
all
this
time
cablegrams
were
coming
from
santa
claus
saying
that
he
would
soon
be
here
and
enjoining
us
to
show
a
true
christian
spirit
and
let
up
on
the
and
tontine
policies
and
platoon
systems
long
enough
to
give
him
a
welcome
everywhere
the
spirit
of
christmas
was
diffusing
itself
the
banks
were
refusing
loans
the

gang
of

in

getting
their
furs

hardly
knew
which
was
the
best
bet

three

it
was
no
time
at
which
to
lose
the

your
heart
if
doctor
watson
investigating
friend
had
been
called
in
to
solve
this
mysterious
disappearance
he
might
have
observed
on
the
wall
a
copy
of
the
vampire
that
would
have
quickly
suggested
by
induction
a
rag
and
a
bone
and
a
hank
of
hair

a
scotch

next

aha

the

quantity
represented
the

the
bone
well
when
dogs

bones
they
done

a

watson

between

of
course
the

but
sherlock
was
not

therefore
it
devolves
but
topography
and
architecture
must
intervene
the
millionaire
palace
occupied
a
lordly
space
in
front
of
it
was
a
lawn
as
a
south
ireland
man
face
two
days
after
a
shave
at
one
side
of
it
and
fronting
on
another
street
was
a
pleasaunce
trimmed
to
a
leaf
and
the
garage
and
stables
the
scotch
pup
had
ravished
the
from
the
nursery
dragged
it
to
a
corner
of
the
lawn
dug
a
hole
and
buried
it
after
the
manner
of
careless
undertakers
there
you
have
the
mystery
solved
and
no
checks
to
write
for
the
hypodermical
wizard
or
notes
to
toss
to
the
sergeant
then
let
get
down
to
the
heart
of
the
thing
tiresome
readers
the
christmas
heart
of
the
thing
fuzzy
was
drunk
not
riotously
or
helplessly
or
loquaciously
as
you
or
i
might
get
but
decently
appropriately
and
inoffensively
as
becomes
a
gentleman
down
on
his
luck
fuzzy
was
a
soldier
of
misfortune
the
road
the
haystack
the
park
bench
the
kitchen
door
the
bitter
round
of
eleemosynary
the
petty
pickings
and
ignobly
garnered
largesse
of
great
cities
these
formed
the
chapters
of
his
history
fuzzy
walked
toward
the
river
down
the
street
that
bounded
one
side
of
the
millionaire
house
and
grounds
he
saw
a
leg
of
betsy
the
lost
protruding
like
the
clue
to
a
lilliputian
murder
mystery
from
its
untimely
grave
in
a
corner
of
the
fence
he
dragged
forth
the
maltreated
infant
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
went
on
his
way
crooning
a
road
song
of
his
brethren
that
no
doll
that
has
been
brought
up
to
the
sheltered
life
should
hear
well
for
betsy
that
she
had
no
ears
and
well
that
she
had
no
eyes
save
unseeing
circles
of
black
for
the
faces
of
fuzzy
and
the
scotch
terrier
were
those
of
brothers
and
the
heart
of
no
could
withstand
twice
to
become
the
prey
of
such
fearsome
monsters
though
you
may
not
know
it
grogan
saloon
stands
near
the
river
and
near
the
foot
of
the
street
down
which
fuzzy
traveled
in
grogan
christmas
cheer
was
already
rampant
fuzzy
entered
with
his
doll
he
fancied
that
as
a
mummer
at
the
feast
of
saturn
he
might
earn
a
few
drops
from
the
wassail
cup
he
set
betsy
on
the
bar
and
addressed
her
loudly
and
humorously
seasoning
his
speech
with
exaggerated
compliments
and
endearments
as
one
entertaining
his
lady
friend
the
loafers
and
bibbers
around
caught
the
farce
of
it
and
roared
the
bartender
gave
fuzzy
a
drink
oh
many
of
us
carry
one
for
the
lady
suggested
fuzzy
impudently
and
tucked
another
contribution
to
art
beneath
his
waistcoat
he
began
to
see
possibilities
in
betsy
his
had
been
a
success
visions
of
a
vaudeville
circuit
about
town
dawned
upon
him
in
a
group
near
the
stove

black
riley
and
mike
well
and
unfavorably
known
in
the
tough
shoestring
district
that
blackened
the
left
bank
of
the
river
they
passed
a
newspaper
back
and
forth
among
themselves
the
item
that
each
solid
and
blunt
forefinger
pointed
out
was
an
advertisement
headed
one
hundred
dollars
reward
to
earn
it
one
must
return
the
lost
strayed
or
stolen
from
the
millionaire
mansion
it
seemed
that
grief
still
ravaged
unchecked
in
the
bosom
of
the
too
faithful
child
flip
the
terrier
capered
and
shook
his
absurd
whisker
before
her
powerless
to
distract
she
wailed
for
her
betsy
in
the
faces
of
walking
talking
and
french
mabelles
and
violettes
the
advertisement
was
a
last
resort
black
riley
came
from
behind
the
stove
and
approached
fuzzy
in
his
parabolic
way
the
christmas
mummer
flushed
with
success
had
tucked
betsy
under
his
arm
and
was
about
to
depart
to
the
filling
of
impromptu
dates

black
riley
to
him
where
did
you
cop
out

this
doll
asked
fuzzy
touching
betsy
with
his
forefinger
to
be
sure
that
she
was
the
one
referred
to
why
this
doll
was
presented

gurgling
insolent
alcoholic
laugh
in
his
face
go
to
the
office
of
sarah
bernhardt

and
propose
to
him
that
she
be
released
from
a
night
performance
to
entertain
the
tackytown
lyceum
and
literary
coterie
you
will
hear
the
duplicate
of
fuzzy
laugh
black
riley
gauged
fuzzy
quickly
with
his
blueberry
eye
as
a
wrestler
does
his
hand
was
itching
to
play
the
roman
and
wrest
the
rag
sabine
from
the
extemporaneous
who
was
entertaining
an
angel
unaware
but
he
refrained
fuzzy
was
fat
and
solid
and
big
three
inches
of
corporeity
defended
from
the
winter
winds
by
dingy
linen
intervened
between
his
vest
and
trousers
countless
small
circular
wrinkles
running
around
his
and
knees
guaranteed
the
quality
of
his
bone
and
muscle
his
small
blue
eyes
bathed
in
the
moisture
of
altruism
and
wooziness
looked
upon
you
kindly
yet
without
abashment
he
was
whiskerly
whiskyly
fleshily
formidable
so
black
riley
temporized
wot
you
take
for
it
den
he
asked
money
said
fuzzy
with
husky
firmness
can
not
buy
her
he
was
intoxicated
with
the
artist
first
sweet
cup
of
attainment
to
set
a
on
a
bar
to
hold
mimic
converse
with
it
and
to
find
his
heart
leaping
with
the
sense
of
plaudits
earned
and
his
throat
scorching
with
free
libations
poured
in
his
honor
could
base
coin
buy
him
from
such
achievements
you
will
perceive
that
fuzzy
had
the
temperament
fuzzy
walked
out
with
the
gait
of
a
trained
in
search
of
other
cafés
to
conquer
though
the
dusk
of
twilight
was
hardly
yet
apparent
lights
were
beginning
to
spangle
the
city
like
bursting
in
a
deep
skillet
christmas
eve
impatiently
expected

peeping
over
the
brink
of
the
hour
millions

prepared
for
its
celebration

be
painted
red
you
yourself
have
heard
the
horns
and
dodged
the
capers
of
the
saturnalians
pigeon
mccarthy
black
riley
and
mike
held
a
hasty
converse
outside
grogan
they
were
pallid
striplings
not
fighters
in
the
open
but
more
dangerous
in
their
ways
of
warfare
than
the
most
terrible
of
turks
fuzzy
in
a
pitched
battle
could
have
eaten
the
three
of
them
in
a
encounter
he
was
already
doomed
they
overtook
him
just
as
he
and
betsy
were
entering
costigan
casino
they
deflected
him
and
shoved
the
newspaper
under
his
nose
fuzzy
could
read
and
more
boys
said
he
you
are
certainly
damn
true
friends
give
me
a
week
to
think
it
over
the
soul
of
a
real
artist
is
quenched
with
difficulty
the
boys
carefully
pointed
out
to
him
that
advertisements
were
soulless
and
that
the
deficiencies
of
the
day
might
not
be
supplied
by
the
morrow
a
cool
hundred
said
fuzzy
thoughtfully
and
mushily
boys
said
he
you

go
up

the

the

not

to

upon
them
acrimoniously

well
fuzzy
entered
the
millionaire
gate
and
zigzagged
toward
the
softly
glowing
entrance
of
the
mansion
the
three
goblins
came
up
to
the
gate
and
lingered
one
on
each
side

one
beyond
the
roadway
they
fingered
their
cold
metal
and
leather
confident
fuzzy
rang
the
smiling
foolishly
and
dreamily
an
atavistic
instinct
prompted
him
to
reach
for
the
button
of
his
right
glove
but
he
wore
no
gloves
so
his
left
hand
dropped

the
particular
menial
whose
duty
it
was
to
open
doors
to
silks
and
laces
shied
at
first
sight
of
fuzzy
but
a
second
glance
took
in
his
passport
his
card
of
admission
his
surety
of
welcome
the
lost
of
the
daughter
of
the
house
dangling
under
his
arm
fuzzy
was
admitted
into
a
great
hall
dim
with
the
glow
from
unseen
lights
the
hireling
went
away
and
returned
with
a
maid
and
the
child
the
doll
was
restored
to
the
mourning
one
she
clasped
her
lost
darling
to
her
breast
and
then
with
the
inordinate
selfishness
and
candor
of
childhood
stamped
her
foot
and
whined
hatred
and
fear
of
the
odious
being
who
had
rescued
her
from
the
depths
of
sorrow
and
despair
fuzzy
wriggled
himself
into
an
ingratiatory
attitude
and
essayed
the
idiotic
smile
and
blattering
small
talk
that
is
supposed
to
charm
the
budding
intellect
of
the
young
the
child
bawled
and
was
dragged
away
hugging
her
betsy
close
there
came
the
secretary
pale
poised
polished
gliding
in
pumps
and
worshipping
pomp
and
ceremony
he
counted
out
into
fuzzy
hand
ten
bills
then
dropped
his
eye
upon
the
door
transferred
it
to
james
its
custodian
indicated
the
obnoxious
earner
of
the
reward
with
the
other
and
allowed
his
pumps
to
waft
him
away
to
secretarial
regions
james
gathered
fuzzy
with
his
own
commanding
optic
and
swept
him
as
far
as
the
front
door
when
the
money
touched
fuzzy
dingy
palm
his
first
instinct
was
to
take
to
his
heels
but
a
second
thought
restrained
him
from
that
blunder
of
etiquette
it
was
his
it
had
been
given
him
it
and
oh
what
an
elysium
it
opened
to
the
gaze
of
his
mind
eye
he
had
tumbled
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
he
was
hungry
homeless
friendless
ragged
cold
drifting
and
he
held
in
his
hand
the
key
to
a
paradise
of
the
that
he
craved
the
fairy
doll
had
waved
a
wand
with
her
hand
and
now
wherever
he
might
go
the
enchanted
palaces
with
shining
and
magic
red
fluids
in
gleaming
glassware
would
be
open
to
him
he
followed
james
to
the
door
he
paused
there
as
the
flunky
drew
open
the
great
mahogany
portal
for
him
to
pass
into
the
vestibule
beyond
the
gates
in
the
dark
highway
black
riley
and
his
two
pals
casually
strolled
fingering
under
their
coats
the
inevitably
fatal
weapons
that
were
to
make
the
reward
of
the
theirs
fuzzy
stopped
at
the
millionaire
door
and
bethought
himself
like
little
sprigs
of
mistletoe
on
a
dead
tree
certain
living
green
thoughts
and
memories
began
to
decorate
his
confused
mind
he
was
quite
drunk
mind
you
and
the
present
was
beginning
to
fade
those
wreaths
and
festoons
of
holly
with
their
scarlet
berries
making
the
great
hall
gay
where
had
he
seen
such
things
before
somewhere
he
had
known
polished
floors
and
odors
of
fresh
flowers
in
winter
and
and
some
one
was
singing
a
song
in
the
house
that
he
thought
he
had
heard
before
some
one
singing
and
playing
a
harp
of
course
it
was
christmas
fuzzy
though
he
must
have
been
pretty
drunk
to
have
overlooked
that
and
then
he
went
out
of
the
present
and
there
came
back
to
him
out
of
some
impossible
vanished
and
irrevocable
past
a
little
transient
forgotten
ghost
the
spirit
of
upon
a
gentleman
certain
things
devolve
james
opened
the
outer
door
a
stream
of
light
went
down
the
graveled
walk
to
the
iron
gate
black
riley
mccarthy
and
mike
saw
and
carelessly
drew
their
sinister
cordon
closer
about
the
gate
with
a
more
imperious
gesture
than
james
master
had
ever
used
or
could
ever
use
fuzzy
compelled
the
menial
to
close
the
door
upon
a
gentleman
certain
things
devolve
especially
at
the
christmas
season
it
is
cust
customary
he
said
to
james
the
flustered
when
a
gentleman
calls
on
christmas
eve
to
pass
the
compliments
of
the
season
with
the
lady
of
the
house
you
i
shall
not
move
shtep
till
i
pass
season
with
lady
the
house
there
was
an
argument
james
lost
fuzzy
raised
his
voice
and
sent
it
through
the
house
unpleasantly
i
did
not
say
he
was
a
gentleman
he
was
simply
a
tramp
being
visited
by
a
ghost
a
sterling
silver
bell
rang
james
went
back
to
answer
it
leaving
fuzzy
in
the
hall
james
explained
somewhere
to
some
one
then
he
came
and
conducted
fuzzy
into
the
library
the
lady
entered
a
moment
later
she
was
more
beautiful
and
holy
than
any
picture
that
fuzzy
had
seen
she
smiled
and
said
something
about
a
doll
fuzzy
did
understand
that
he
remembered
nothing
about
a
doll
a
footman
brought
in
two
small
glasses
of
sparkling
wine
on
a
stamped
waiter
the
lady
took
one
the
other
was
handed
to
fuzzy
as
his
fingers
closed
on
the
slender
glass
stem
his
disabilities
dropped
from
him
for
one
brief
moment
he
straightened
himself
and
time
so
disobliging
to
most
of
us
turned
backward
to
accommodate
fuzzy
forgotten
christmas
ghosts
whiter
than
the
false
beards
of
the
most
opulent
kris
kringle
were
rising
in
the
fumes
of
grogan
whisky
what
had
the
millionaire
mansion
to
do
with
a
long
wainscoted
virginia
hall
where
the
riders
were
grouped
around
a
silver
drinking
the
ancient
toast
of
the
house
and
why
should
the
patter
of
the
cab
horses
hoofs
on
the
frozen
street
be
in
any
wise
related
to
the
sound
of
the
saddled
hunters
stamping
under
the
shelter
of
the
west
veranda
and
what
had
fuzzy
to
do
with
any
of
it
the
lady
looking
at
him
over
her
glass
let
her
condescending
smile
fade
away
like
a
false
dawn
her
eyes
turned
serious
she
saw
something
beneath
the
rags
and
scotch
terrier
whiskers
that
she
did
not
understand
but
it
did
not
matter
fuzzy
lifted
his
glass
and
smiled
vacantly
lady
he
said
but
could
leave
without
sheason
with
lady
th
house
do
sho
and
then
he
began
the
ancient
salutation
that
was
a
tradition
in
the
house
when
men
wore
lace
ruffles
and
powder
the
blessings
of
another
year
fuzzy
memory
failed
him
the
lady
prompted
be
upon
this
hearth
the
guest
stammered
and
upon
her
who
continued
the
lady
with
a
leading
smile
oh
cut
it
out
said
fuzzy
i
ca
remember
drink
hearty
fuzzy
had
shot
his
arrow
they
drank
the
lady
smiled
again
the
smile
of
her
caste
james
enveloped
and
him
toward
the
front
door
the
harp
music
still
softly
drifted
through
the
house
outside
black
riley
breathed
on
his
cold
hands
and
hugged
the
gate
i
wonder
said
the
lady
to
herself
musing
who
but
there
were
so
many
who
came
i
wonder
whether
memory
is
a
curse
or
a
blessing
to
them
after
they
have
fallen
so
low
fuzzy
and
his
escort
were
nearly
at
the
door
the
lady
called
james
james
stalked
back
obsequiously
leaving
fuzzy
waiting
unsteadily
with
his
brief
spark
of
the
divine
fire
gone
outside
black
riley
stamped
his
cold
feet
and
got
a
firmer
grip
on
his
section
of
you
will
conduct
this
gentleman
said
the
lady
downstairs
then
tell
louis
to
get
out
the
mercedes
and
take
him
to
whatever
place
he
wishes
to
go
xvii
a
night
in

the

and
byways
are
thronged
with
al
rashids
in
divers
disguises
seeking
diversion
and
victims
for
their
unbridled
generosity
you
can
scarcely
find
a
poor
beggar
whom
they
are
willing
to
let
enjoy
his
spoils
unsuccored
nor
a
wrecked
unfortunate
upon
whom
they
will
not
reshower
the
means
of
fresh
misfortune
you
will
hardly
find
anywhere
a
hungry
one
who

not
had
the
opportunity
to
tighten
his
belt
in

nor
a
poor
pundit
who
has
not
blushed
at
the
holiday
basket
of
turkey
forced
resoundingly
through
his
door
by
the
eleemosynary
press
so
then
fearfully
through
the
streets
creep
the
calenders
the
little
hunchback
and
the
barber
sixth
brother
hoping
to
escape
the
ministrations
of
the
roving
horde
of
caliphoid
sultans

nights

be
had
from
the
histories
of
those
who
have
escaped
the
largesse
of
the
army
of
commanders
of
the
faithful
until
dawn
you
might
sit
on
the
enchanted
rug
and
listen
to
such
stories
as
are
told
of
the
powerful
genie
who

the
forty
thieves
to
soak
up
the

valuable
to
be

in

the

languishes

hunting
the
happy

and
the
resigned
unfortunate
from
cover
to
cover
in
order
to
heap
upon
them
strange
mercies
and
mysterious
benefits
too
often
comes
the
report
from
arabian
headquarters
that
the
captive
refused
to
talk
this
reticence
then
in
the
actors
who
perform
the
sad
comedies
of
their
world
must
in
a
degree
account
for
the
shortcomings
of
this
painfully
gleaned
tale
which
shall
be
called
the
story
of
the
caliph
who
alleviated
his
conscience
old
jacob
spraggins
mixed
for
himself
some
scotch
and
lithia
water
at
his
oak
sideboard
inspiration
must
have
resulted
from
its
imbibition
for
immediately
afterward
he
struck
the
quartered
oak
soundly
with
his
fist
and
shouted
to
the
empty
dining
room
by
the
coke
ovens
of
hell
it
must
be
that
ten
thousand
dollars
if
i
can
get
that
squared
it
do
the
trick
thus
by
the
commonest
artifice
of
the
trade
having
gained
your
interest
the
action
of
the
story
will
now
be
suspended
leaving
you
grumpily
to
consider
a
sort
of
dull
biography
beginning
fifteen
years
before
when
old
jacob
was
young
jacob
he
was
a
breaker
boy
in
a
pennsylvania
coal
mine
i
do
know
what
a
breaker
boy
is
but
his
occupation
seems
to
be
standing
by
a
coal
dump
with
a
wan
look
and
a
to
have
his
picture
taken
for
magazine
articles
anyhow
jacob
was
one
but
instead
of
dying
of
overwork
at
nine
and
leaving
his
helpless
parents
and
brothers
at
the
mercy
of
the
union
strikers
reserve
fund
he
hitched
up
his
galluses
put
a
dollar
or
two
in
a
side
proposition
now
and
then
and
at
was
worth
there
now
it
over
hardly
had
time
to
yawn
did
you
i
seen
biographies
that
but
let
us
dissemble
i
want
you
to
consider
jacob
spraggins
after
he
had
arrived
at
the
seventh
stage
of
his
career
the
stages
meant
are
first
humble
origin
second
deserved
promotion
third
stockholder
fourth
capitalist
fifth
trust
magnate
sixth
rich
malefactor
seventh
caliph
eighth
the
eighth
stage
shall
be
left
to
the
higher
mathematics
at
jacob
retired
from
active
business
the
income
of
a
czar
was
still
rolling
in
on
him
from
coal
iron
real
estate
oil
railroads
manufactories
and
corporations
but
none
of
it
touched
jacob
hands
in
a
raw
state
it
was
a
sterilized
increment
carefully
cleaned
and
dusted
and
fumigated
until
it
arrived
at
its
ultimate
stage
of
untainted
spotless
checks
in
the
white
fingers
of
his
private
secretary
jacob
built
a
palace
on
a
corner
lot
fronting
on
nabob
avenue
city
of
new
bagdad
and
began
to
feel
the
mantle
of
the
late
rashid
descending
upon
him
eventually
jacob
slipped
the
mantle
under
his
collar
tied
it
in
a
neat
and
became
a
licensed
harrier
of
our
mesopotamian
proletariat
when
a
man
income
becomes
so
large
that
the
butcher
actually
sends
him
the
kind
of
steak
he
orders
he
begins
to
think
about
his
salvation
now
the
various
stages
or
classes
of
rich
men
must
not
be
forgotten
the
capitalist
can
tell
you
to
a
dollar
the
amount
of
his
wealth
the
trust
magnate
estimates
it
the
rich
malefactor
hands
you
a
cigar
and
denies
that
he
has
bought
the
q
the
caliph
merely
smiles
and
talks
about
hammerstein
and
the
musical
lasses
there
is
a
record
of
tremendous
altercation
at
breakfast
in
a
tavern
between
a
magnate
and
his
wife
the
rift
within
the
loot
being
that
the
wife
calculated
their
fortune
at
a
figure
higher
than
did
her
future
oh
well
i
myself
heard
a
similar
quarrel
between
a
man
and
his
wife
because
he
found
fifty
cents
less
in
his
pockets
than
he
thought
he
had
after
all
we
are
all
human
count
tolstoi
fitzsimmons
peter
pan
and
the
rest
of
us
do
lose
heart
because
the
story
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
a
sort
of
moral
essay
for
intellectual
readers
there
will
be
dialogue
and
stage
business
pretty
soon
when
jacob
first
began
to
compare
the
eyes
of
needles
with
the
camels
in
the
zoo
he
decided
upon
organized
charity
he
had
his
secretary
send
a
check
for
one
million
to
the
universal
benevolent
association
of
the
globe
you
may
have
looked
down
through
a
grating
in
front
of
a
decayed
warehouse
for
a
nickel
that
you
had
dropped
through
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
association
acknowledged
receipt
of
his
favor
of
the
ult
with
enclosure
as
stated
separated
by
a
double
line
but
still
mighty
close
to
the
matter
under
the
caption
of
oddities
of
the
day
news
in
an
evening
paper
jacob
spraggins
read
that
one
jasper
spargyous
had
donated
to
the
u
b
of
a
camel
may
have
a
stomach
for
each
day
in
the
week
but
i
dare
not
venture
to
accord
him
whiskers
for
fear
of
the
great
displeasure
at
washington
but
if
he
have
whiskers
surely
not
one
of
them
will
seem
to
have
been
inserted
in
the
eye
of
a
needle
by
that
effort
of
that
rich
man
to
enter
the
of
the
right
is
reserved
to
reject
any
and
all
bids
signed
peter
secretary
and
gatekeeper
next
jacob
selected
the
best
endowed
college
he
could
scare
up
and
presented
it
with
a
laboratory
the
college
did
not
maintain
a
scientific
course
but
it
accepted
the
money
and
built
an
elaborate
lavatory
instead
which
was
no
diversion
of
funds
so
far
as
jacob
ever
discovered
the
faculty
met
and
invited
jacob
to
come
over
and
take
his
a
b
c
degree
before
sending
the
invitation
they
smiled
cut
out
the
c
added
the
proper
punctuation
marks
and
all
was
well
while
walking
on
the
campus
before
being
capped
and
gowned
jacob
saw
two
professors
strolling
nearby
their
voices
long
adapted
to
indoor
acoustics
undesignedly
reached
his
ear
there
goes
the
latest
said
one
of
them
to
buy
a
sleeping
powder
from
us
he
gets
his
degree
foro
said
the
other
let
a
brick
at
jacob
ignored
the
latin
but
the
brick
pleasantry
was
not
too
hard
for
him
there
was
no
mandragora
in
the
honorary
draught
of
learning
that
he
had
bought
that
was
before
the
passage
of
the
pure
food
and
drugs
act
jacob
wearied
of
philanthropy
on
a
large
scale
if
i
could
see
folks
made
happier
he
said
to
himself
if
i
could
see
myself
and
hear
express
their
gratitude
for
what
i
done
for
it
would
make
me
feel
better
this
donatin
funds
to
institutions
and
societies
is
about
as
satisfactory
as
dropping
money
into
a
broken
slot
machine
so
jacob
followed
his
nose
which
led
him
through
unswept
streets
to
the
homes
of
the
poorest
the
very
thing
said
jacob
i
will
charter
two
river
steamboats
pack
them
full
of
these
unfortunate
children
and
say
ten
thousand
dolls
and
drums
and
a
thousand
freezers
of
ice
cream
and
give
them
a
delightful
outing
up
the
sound
the
sea
breezes
on
that
trip
ought
to
blow
the
taint
off
some
of
this
money
that
keeps
coming
in
faster
than
i
can
work
it
off
my
mind
jacob
must
have
leaked
some
of
his
benevolent
intentions
for
an
immense
person
with
a
bald
face
and
a
mouth
that
looked
as
if
it
ought
to
have
a
drop
letters
here
sign
over
it
hooked
a
finger
around
him
and
set
him
in
a
space
between
a
barber
pole
and
a
stack
of
ash
cans
words
came
out
of
the
slit
smooth
husky
words
with
gloves
on
but
sounding
as
if
they
might
turn
to
bare
knuckles

uncle
or
do
you
want

mike
for
de
santa
claus
belt
in
dis
district
clearly
that
spot
in
the
moral
vineyard
was
preempted
so
caliph
spraggins
menaced
no
more
the
people
in
the
bazaars
of
the
east
side
to
keep
down
his
growing
surplus
he
doubled
his
donations
to
organized
charity
presented
the
of
his
native
town
with
a
collection
of
butterflies
and
sent
a
check
to
the
famine
sufferers
in
china
big
enough
to
buy
new
emerald
eyes
and
teeth
for
all
their
gods
but
none
of
these
charitable
acts
seemed
to
bring
peace
to
the
caliph
heart
he
tried
to
get
a
personal
note
into
his
benefactions
by
tipping
bellboys
and
waiters
and
bills
he
got
well
snickered
at
and
derided
for
that
by
the
minions
who
accept
with
respect
gratuities
commensurate
to
the
service
performed
he
sought
out
an
ambitious
and
talented
but
poor
young
woman
and
bought
for
her
the
star
part
in
a
new
comedy
he
might
have
gotten
rid
of
more
of
his
cumbersome
money
in
this
philanthropy
if
he
had
not
neglected
to
write
letters
to
her
but
she
lost
the
suit
for
lack
of
evidence
while
his
capital
still
kept
piling
up
and
his
needleorum
or
rich
man
disease
was
unrelieved
in
caliph
spraggins
home
lived
his
sister
henrietta
who
used
to
cook
for
the
coal
miners
in
a
eating
house
in
coketown
and
who
now
would
have
offered
john
mitchell
only
two
fingers
of
her
hand
to
shake
and
his
daughter
celia
nineteen
back
from
and
from
being
polished
off
by
private
instructors
in
the
restaurant
languages
and
those
études
and
things
celia
is
the
heroine
lest
the
artist
delineation
of
her
charms
on
this
very
page
humbug
your
fancy
take
from
me
her
authorized
description
she
was
a
awkward
loud
rather
bashful
girl
with
a
sallow
complexion
bright
eyes
and
a
perpetual
smile
she
had
a
wholesome
love
for
plain
food
loose
clothing
and
the
society
of
the
lower
classes
she
had
too
much
health
and
youth
to
feel
the
burden
of
wealth
she
had
a
wide
mouth
that
kept
the
tablets
rattling
like
hail
from
the
wherever
she
went
and
she
could
whistle
hornpipes
keep
this
picture
in
mind
and
let
the
artist
do
his
worst
celia
looked
out
of
her
window
one
day
and
gave
her
heart
to
the
grocer
young
man
the
receiver
thereof
was
at
that
moment
engaged
in
conceding
immortality
to
his
horse
and
calling
down
upon
him
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
wicked
so
he
did
not
notice
the
transfer
a
horse
should
stand
still
when
you
are
lifting
a
crate
of
strictly
eggs
out
of
the
wagon
young
lady
reader
you
would
have
liked
that
grocer
young
man
yourself
but
you
would
have
given
him
your
heart
because
you
are
saving
it
for
a
or
a
with
a
torpid
liver
or
something
quiet
but
rich
in
gray
tweeds
at
palm
beach
oh
i
know
about
it
so
i
am
glad
the
grocer
young
man
was
for
celia
and
not
for
you
the
grocer
young
man
was
slim
and
straight
and
as
confident
and
easy
in
his
movements
as
the
man
in
the
back
of
the
magazines
who
wears
the
new
frictionless
roller
suspenders
he
wore
a
gray
bicycle
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
hair
was
and
curly
and
his
sunburned
face
looked
like
one
that
smiled
a
good
deal
when
he
was
not
preaching
the
doctrine
of
everlasting
punishment
to
horses
he
slung
imported
fancy
groceries
about
as
though
they
were
only
the
stuff
he
delivered
at
and
when
he
picked
up
his
whip
your
mind
instantly
recalled
tackett
and
his
air
with
the
buttonless
foils
tradesmen
delivered
their
goods
at
a
side
gate
at
the
rear
of
the
house
the
grocer
wagon
came
about
ten
in
the
morning
for
three
days
celia
watched
the
driver
when
he
came
finding
something
new
each
time
to
admire
in
the
lofty
and
almost
contemptuous
way
he
had
of
tossing
around
the
choicest
gifts
of
pomona
ceres
and
the
canning
factories
then
she
consulted
annette
to
be
explicit
annette
mccorkle
the
second
housemaid
who
deserves
a
paragraph
herself
annette
fletcherized
large
numbers
of
romantic
novels
which
she
obtained
at
a
free
public
library
branch
donated
by
one
of
the
biggest
caliphs
in
the
business
she
was
celia
and
chum
though
aunt
henrietta
did
know
it
you
may
hazard
a
bean
or
two
oh
seed
exclaimed
annette
ai
it
a
situation
you
a
heiress
and
fallin
in
love
with
him
on
sight
he
a
sweet
boy
too
and
above
his
business
but
he
ai
susceptible
like
the
common
run
of
grocer
assistants
he
never
pays
no
attention
to
me
he
will
to
me
said
celia
riches
began
annette
unsheathing
the
not
unjustifiable
feminine
sting
oh
you
not
so
beautiful
said
celia
with
her
wide
disarming
smile
neither
am
i
but
he
know
that
there
any
money
mixed
up
with
my
looks
such
as
they
are
that
fair
now
i
want
you
to
lend
me
one
of
your
caps
and
an
apron
annette
oh
marshmallows
cried
annette
i
see
ai
it
lovely
it
just
like
the
or
a
buttonhole
maker
wrongs
bet
he
turn
out
to
be
a
count
there
was
a
long
hallway
or
passageway
as
they
call
it
in
the
land
of
the
colonels
with
one
side
latticed
running
along
the
rear
of
the
house
the
grocer
young
man
went
through
this
to
deliver
his
goods
one
morning
he
passed
a
girl
in
there
with
shining
eyes
sallow
complexion
and
wide
smiling
mouth
wearing
a
maid
cap
and
apron
but
as
he
was
cumbered
with
a
basket
of
early
drumhead
lettuce
and
trophy
tomatoes
and
three
bunches
of
asparagus
and
six
bottles
of
the
most
expensive
queen
olives
he
saw
no
more
than
that
she
was
one
of
the
maids
but
on
his
way
out
he
came
up
behind
her
and
she
was
whistling
fisher
hornpipe
so
loudly
and
clearly
that
all
the
piccolos
in
the
world
should
have
disjointed
themselves
and
crept
into
their
cases
for
shame
the
grocer
young
man
stopped
and
pushed
back
his
cap
until
it
hung
on
his
collar
button
behind
that
out
o
sight
kid
said
he
my
name
is
celia
if
you
please
said
the
whistler
dazzling
him
with
a
smile
that
all
right
i
thomas
mcleod
what
part
of
the
house
do
you
work
in
i
the
the
second
parlor
maid
do
you
know
the
waters
no
said
celia
we
do
know
anybody
we
got
rich
too
quick
that
is
spraggins
did
i
make
you
acquainted
said
thomas
mcleod
it
a
strathspey
the
first
cousin
to
a
hornpipe
if
celia
whistling
put
the
piccolos
out
of
commission
thomas
surely
made
the
biggest
flutes
hunt
their
holes
he
could
actually
whistle
when
he
stopped
celia
was
ready
to
jump
into
his
delivery
wagon
and
ride
with
him
clear
to
the
end
of
the
pier
and
on
to
the
of
the
charon
line
i
be
around
at
said
thomas
with
some
spinach
and
a
case
of
carbonic
i
practice
that
said
celia
i
can
whistle
a
fine
second
the
processes
of
courtship
are
personal
and
do
not
belong
to
general
literature
they
should
be
chronicled
in
detail
only
in
advertisements
of
iron
tonics
and
in
the
secret
of
the
woman
auxiliary
of
the
ancient
order
of
the
rat
trap
but
genteel
writing
may
contain
a
description
of
certain
stages
of
its
progress
without
intruding
upon
the
province
of
the
or
of
park
policemen
a
day
came
when
thomas
mcleod
and
celia
lingered
at
the
end
of
the
latticed
passage
sixteen
a
week
is
much
said
thomas
letting
his
cap
rest
on
his
shoulder
blades
celia
looked
through
the
and
whistled
a
dead
march
shopping
with
aunt
henrietta
the
day
before
she
had
paid
that
much
for
a
dozen
handkerchiefs
maybe
i
get
a
raise
next
month
said
thomas
i
be
around
at
the
same
time
with
a
bag
of
flour
and
the
laundry
soap
all
right
said
celia
annette
married
cousin
pays
only
a
month
for
a
flat
in
the
bronx
never
for
a
moment
did
she
count
on
the
spraggins
money
she
knew
aunt
henrietta
invincible
pride
of
caste
and
pa
mightiness
as
a
colossus
of
cash
and
she
understood
that
if
she
chose
thomas
she
and
her
grocer
young
man
might
go
whistle
for
a
living
another
day
came
thomas
violating
the
dignity
of
nabob
avenue
with
the
devil
dream
whistled
keenly
between
his
teeth
raised
to
eighteen
a
week
yesterday
he
said
been
pricing
flats
around
morningside
you
want
to
start
untying
those
apron
strings
and
unpinning
that
cap
old
girl
oh
tommy
said
celia
with
her
broadest
smile
wo
that
be
enough
i
got
betty
to
show
me
how
to
make
a
cottage
pudding
i
guess
we
could
call
it
a
flat
pudding
if
we
wanted
to
and
tell
no
lie
said
thomas
and
i
can
sweep
and
polish
and
dust
of
course
a
parlor
maid
learns
that
and
we
could
whistle
duets
of
evenings
the
old
man
said
he
raise
me
to
twenty
at
christmas
if
bryan
think
of
any
harder
name
to
call
a
republican
than
a
said
the
grocer
young
man
i
can
sew
said
celia
and
i
know
that
you
must
make
the
gas
company
man
show
his
badge
when
he
comes
to
look
at
the
meter
and
i
know
how
to
put
up
quince
jam
and
window
curtains
bully
you
all
right
cele
yes
i
believe
we
can
pull
it
off
on
eighteen
as
he
was
jumping
into
the
wagon
the
second
parlor
maid
braved
discovery
by
running
swiftly
to
the
gate
and
oh
tommy
i
forgot
she
called
softly
i
believe
i
could
make
your
neckties
forget
it
said
thomas
decisively
and
another
thing
she
continued
sliced
cucumbers
at
night
will
drive
away
cockroaches
and
sleep
too
you
bet
said
mcleod
yes
i
believe
if
i
have
a
delivery
to
make
on
the
west
side
this
afternoon
i
look
in
at
a
furniture
store
i
know
over
there
it
was
just
as
the
wagon
dashed
away
that
old
jacob
spraggins
struck
the
sideboard
with
his
fist
and
made
the
mysterious
remark
about
ten
thousand
dollars
that
you
perhaps
remember
which
justifies
the
reflection
that
some
stories
as
well
as
life
and
puppies
thrown
into
wells
move
around
in
circles
painfully
but
briefly
we
must
shed
light
on
jacob
words
the
foundation
of
his
fortune
was
made
when
he
was
twenty
a
poor
ever
hear
of
a
rich
one
had
saved
a
dollar
or
two
and
bought
a
small
tract
of
land
on
a
hillside
on
which
he
tried
to
raise
corn
not
a
nubbin
jacob
whose
nose
was
a
told
him
there
was
a
vein
of
coal
beneath
he
bought
the
land
from
the
miner
for
and
sold
it
a
month
afterward
for
luckily
the
miner
had
enough
left
of
his
sale
money
to
drink
himself
into
a
black
coat
opening
in
the
back
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
news
and
so
for
forty
years
afterward
we
find
jacob
illuminated
with
the
sudden
thought
that
if
he
could
make
restitution
of
this
sum
of
money
to
the
heirs
or
assigns
of
the
unlucky
miner
respite
and
nepenthe
might
be
his
and
now
must
come
swift
action
for
we
have
here
some
four
thousand
words
and
not
a
tear
shed
and
never
a
pistol
joke
safe
nor
bottle
cracked
old
jacob
hired
a
dozen
private
detectives
to
find
the
heirs
if
any
existed
of
the
old
miner
hugh
mcleod
get
the
point
of
course
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
thomas
is
going
to
be
the
heir
i
might
have
concealed
the
name
but
why
always
hold
back
your
mystery
till
the
end
i
say
let
it
come
near
the
middle
so
people
can
stop
reading
there
if
they
want
to
after
the
detectives
had
trailed
false
clues
about
three
thousand
dollars
i
mean
miles
they
cornered
thomas
at
the
grocery
and
got
his
confession
that
hugh
mcleod
had
been
his
grandfather
and
that
there
were
no
other
heirs
they
arranged
a
meeting
for
him
and
old
jacob
one
morning
in
one
of
their
offices
jacob
liked
the
young
man
very
much
he
liked
the
way
he
looked
straight
at
him
when
he
talked
and
the
way
he
threw
his
bicycle
cap
over
the
top
of
a
vase
on
the
there
was
a
slight
flaw
in
jacob
system
of
restitution
he
did
not
consider
that
the
act
to
be
perfect
should
include
confession
so
he
represented
himself
to
be
the
agent
of
the
purchaser
of
the
land
who
had
sent
him
to
refund
the
sale
price
for
the
ease
of
his
conscience
well
sir
said
thomas
this
sounds
to
me
like
an
illustrated
from
south
boston
with
having
a
good
time
here
written
on
it
i
do
know
the
game
is
this
ten
thousand
dollars
money
or
do
i
have
to
save
so
many
coupons
to
get
it
old
jacob
counted
out
to
him
twenty
bills
that
was
better
he
thought
than
a
check
thomas
put
them
thoughtfully
into
his
pocket
grandfather
best
thanks
he
said
to
the
party
who
sends
it
jacob
talked
on
asking
him
about
his
work
how
he
spent
his
leisure
time
and
what
his
ambitions
were
the
more
he
saw
and
heard
of
thomas
the
better
he
liked
him
he
had
not
met
many
young
men
in
bagdad
so
frank
and
wholesome
i
would
like
to
have
you
visit
my
house
he
said
i
might
help
you
in
investing
or
laying
out
your
money
i
am
a
very
wealthy
man
i
have
a
daughter
about
grown
and
i
would
like
for
you
to
know
her
there
are
not
many
young
men
i
would
care
to
have
call
on
her
i
obliged
said
thomas
i
not
much
at
making
calls
generally
the
side
entrance
for
mine
and
besides
i
engaged
to
a
girl
that
has
the
delaware
peach
crop
killed
in
the
blossom
she
a
parlor
maid
in
a
house
where
i
deliver
goods
she
wo
be
working
there
much
longer
though
say
do
forget
to
give
your
friend
my
grandfather
best
regards
you
excuse
me
now
my
wagon
outside
with
a
lot
of
green
stuff
that
got
to
be
delivered
see
you
again
sir
at
eleven
thomas
delivered
some
bunches
of
parsley
and
lettuce
at
the
spraggins
mansion
thomas
was
only
so
as
he
came
back
he
took
out
the
handful
of
bills
and
waved
them
carelessly
annette
took
a
pair
of
eyes
as
big
as
creamed
onion
to
the
cook
i
told
you
he
was
a
count
she
said
after
relating
he
never
would
carry
on
with
me
but
you
say
he
showed
money
said
the

thoughtful

was
there

a
brief
search
in

then
came
annette
glowing
with
the
pure
flame
of
truth
and
loyalty
well
mixed
with
envy
and
histrionics
oh

said
she
wondering
if
she
should
kneel

in

save

to
that

we
are
driven
for
our
moral
theme
when
we
levied
upon
the
masters
of
old
they
gleefully
dug
up
the
parallels
to
our
columns
when
we
strove
to
set

they
reproached
us
for
trying

about

the

were
hammering
away
at

miss
merriam
was
cashier
at
hinkle
hinkle
is
one
of
the
big
downtown
restaurants
it
is
in
what
the
papers
call
the
financial
district
each
day
from
to
hinkle
was
full
of
hungry
customers
messenger
boys
stenographers
brokers
owners
of
mining
stock
promoters
inventors
with
patents
pending
and
also
people
with
money
the
cashiership
at
hinkle
was
no
sinecure
hinkle
egged
and
toasted
and
and
coffeed
a
good
many
customers
and
he
lunched
as
good
a
word
as
dined
many
more
it
might
be
said
that
breakfast
crowd
was
a
contingent
but
his
luncheon
patronage
amounted
to
a
horde
miss
merriam
sat
on
a
stool
at
a
desk
inclosed
on
three
sides
by
a
strong
high
fencing
of
woven
brass
wire
through
an
arched
opening
at
the
bottom
you
thrust
your
waiter
check
and
the
money
while
your
heart
went
for
miss
merriam
was
lovely
and
capable
she
could
take
cents
out
of
a
bill
and
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
before
you
could
next
lost
your
chance
please
do
shove
she
could
keep
cool
and
collected
while
she
collected
your
check
give
you
the
correct
change
win
your
heart
indicate
the
toothpick
stand
and
rate
you
to
a
quarter
of
a
cent
better
than
bradstreet
could
to
a
thousand
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
pepper
an
egg
with
one
of
hinkle
casters
there
is
an
old
and
dignified
allusion
to
the
fierce
light
that
beats
upon
a
throne
the
light
that
beats
upon
the
young
lady
cashier
cage
is
also
something
fierce
the
other
fellow
is
responsible
for
the
slang
every
male
patron
of
hinkle
from
the
boys
up
to
the
curbstone
brokers
adored
miss
merriam
when
they
paid
their
checks
they
wooed
her
with
every
wile
known
to
cupid
art
between
the
meshes
of
the
brass
railing
went
smiles
winks
compliments
tender
vows
invitations
to
dinner
sighs
languishing
looks
and
merry
banter
that
was
wafted
pointedly
back
by
the
gifted
miss
merriam
there
is
no
coign
of
vantage
more
effective
than
the
position
of
young
lady
cashier
she
sits
there
easily
queen
of
the
court
of
commerce
she
is
duchess
of
dollars
and
devoirs
countess
of
compliments
and
coin
leading
lady
of
love
and
luncheon
you
take
from
her
a
smile
and
a
canadian
dime
and
you
go
your
way
uncomplaining
you
count
the
cheery
word
or
two
that
she
tosses
you
as
misers
count
their
treasures
and
you
pocket
the
change
for
a
five
uncomputed
perhaps
the
inaccessibility
multiplies
her
charms
anyhow
she
is
a
angel
immaculate
trim
manicured
seductive
ready
alert
psyche
circe
and
ate
in
one
separating
you
from
your
circulating
medium
after
your
sirloin
medium
the
young
men
who
broke
bread
at
hinkle
never
settled
with
the
cashier
without
an
exchange
of
badinage
and
open
compliment
many
of
them
went
to
greater
lengths
and
dropped
promissory
hints
of
theatre
tickets
and
chocolates
the
older
men
spoke
plainly
of
orange
blossoms
generally
withering
the
tentative
petals
by
to
harlem
flats
one
broker
who
had
been
squeezed
by
copper

regularly

during
a
brisk
luncheon

is
two
about
the
middle
of
one
afternoon
the
dizzy
goddess
vertigo
whose
other
name
is
fortune
suddenly
smote
an
old
wealthy
and
eccentric
banker
while
he
was
walking
past
hinkle
on
his
way
to
a
street
car
a
wealthy
and
eccentric
banker
who
rides
in
street
cars
is
move
up
please
there
are
others
a
samaritan
a
pharisee
a
man
and
a
policeman
who
were
first
on
the
spot
lifted
banker
mcramsey
and
carried
him
into
hinkle
restaurant
when
the
aged
but
indestructible
banker
opened
his
eyes
he
saw
a
beautiful
vision
bending
over
him
with
a
pitiful
tender
smile
bathing
his
forehead
with
beef
tea
and
chafing
his
hands
with
something
frappé
out
of
a
mcramsey
sighed
lost
a
vest
button
gazed
with
deep
gratitude
upon
his
fair
preserveress
and
then
recovered
consciousness
to
the
seaside
library
all
who
are
anticipating
a
romance
banker
mcramsey
had
an
aged
and
respected
wife
and
his
sentiments
toward
miss
merriam
were
fatherly
he
talked
to
her
for
half
an
hour
with
interest
not
the
kind
that
went
with
his
talks
during
business
hours
the
next
day
he
brought
mcramsey
down
to
see
her
the
old
couple
were
childless
they
had
only
a
married
daughter
living
in
brooklyn
to
make
a
short
story
shorter
the
beautiful
cashier
won
the
hearts
of
the
good
old
couple
they
came
to
hinkle
again
and
again
they
invited
her
to
their
but
splendid
home
in
one
of
the
east
seventies
miss
merriam
winning
loveliness
her
sweet
frankness
and
impulsive
heart
took
them
by
storm
they
said
a
hundred
times
that
miss
merriam
reminded
them
so
much
of
their
lost
daughter
the
brooklyn
matron
née
ramsey
had
the
figure
of
buddha
and
a
face
like
the
ideal
of
an
art
photographer
miss
merriam
was
a
combination
of
curves
smiles
rose
leaves
pearls
satin
and
posters
enough
of
the
fatuity
of
parents
a
month
after
the
worthy
couple
became
acquainted
with
miss
merriam
she
stood
before
hinkle
one
afternoon
and
resigned
her
cashiership
they
going
to
adopt
me
she
told
the
bereft
restaurateur
funny
old
people
but
regular
dears
and
the
swell
home
they
have
got
say
hinkle
there
is
any
use
of
talking
i
on
the
à
la
carte
to
wear
brown
duds
and
goggles
in
a
whiz
wagon
or
marry
a
duke
at
least
still
i
somehow
hate
to
break
out
of
the
old
cage
i
been
cashiering
so
long
i
feel
funny
doing
anything
else
i
miss
joshing
the
fellows
awfully
when
they
line
up
to
pay
for
the
buckwheats
and
but
i
ca
let
this
chance
slide
and
they
awfully
good
hinkle
i
know
i
have
a
swell
time
you
owe
me
and
a
half
for
the
week
cut
out
the
half
if
it
hurts
you
hinkle
and
they
did
miss
merriam
became
miss
rosa
mcramsey
and
she
graced
the
transition
beauty
is
only
but
the
nerves
lie
very
near
to
the
skin
nerve
but
just
here
will
you
oblige
by
perusing
again
the
quotation
with
which
this
story
begins
the
mcramseys
poured
out
money
like
domestic
champagne
to
polish
their
adopted
one
milliners
dancing
masters
and
private
tutors
got
it
miss
er
mcramsey
was
grateful
loving
and
tried
to
forget
hinkle
to
give
ample
credit
to
the
adaptability
of
the
american
girl
did
fade
from
her
memory
and
speech
most
of
the
time
not
every
one
will
remember
when
the
earl
of
hitesbury
came
to
east
seventy
street
america
he
was
only
a
earl
without
debts
and
he
created
little
excitement
but
you
will
surely
remember
the
evening
when
the
daughters
of
benevolence
held
their
bazaar
in
the
w
a
hotel
for
you
were
there
and
you
wrote
a
note
to
fannie
on
the
hotel
paper
and
mailed
it
just
to
show
her
that
you
did
not
very
well
that
was
the
evening
the
baby
was
sick
of
course
at
the
bazaar
the
mcramseys
were
prominent
miss
mer
er
mcramsey
was
exquisitely
beautiful
the
earl
of
hitesbury
had
been
very
attentive
to
her
since
he
dropped
in
to
have
a
look
at
america
at
the
charity
bazaar
the
affair
was
supposed
to
be
going
to
be
pulled
off
to
a
finish
an
earl
is
as
good
as
a
duke
better
his
standing
may
be
lower
but
his
outstanding
accounts
are
also
lower
our
was
assigned
to
a
booth
she
was
expected
to
sell
worthless
articles
to
nobs
and
snobs
at
exorbitant
prices
the
proceeds
of
the
bazaar
were

you
ever

where
they
get
the
other
miss
mcramsey
beautiful
palpitating
excited
charming
radiant
fluttered
about
in
her
booth
an
imitation
brass
network
with
a
little
arched
opening
fenced
her
in
along
came
the
earl
assured
delicate
accurate
admiring
admiring
greatly
and
faced
the
open

you
look
chawming
you
know
my
word
you
do
my
deah
he
said
beguilingly
miss
mcramsey
whirled
around
cut
that
joshing
out
she
said
coolly
and
briskly
who
do
you
think
you
are
talking
to
your
check
please
oh
lordy
patrons
of
the
bazaar
became
aware
of
a
commotion
and
pressed
around
a
certain
booth
the
earl
of
hitesbury
stood
near
by
pulling
a
pale
blond
and
puzzled
whisker
miss
mcramsey
has
fainted
some
one
explained
xix
proof
of
the
pudding
spring
winked
a
vitreous
optic
at
editor
westbrook
of
the
and
deflected
him
from
his
course
he
had
lunched
in
his
favorite
corner
of
a
broadway
hotel
and
was
returning
to
his
office
when
his
feet
became
entangled
in
the
lure
of
the
vernal
coquette
which
is
by
way
of
saying
that
he
turned
eastward
in
street
safely
forded
the
spring
freshet
of
vehicles
in
fifth
avenue
and
meandered
along
the
walks
of
budding
madison
square
the
lenient
air
and
the
settings
of
the
little
park
almost
formed
a
pastoral
the
color
motif
was
green
the
presiding
shade
at
the
creation
of
man
and
vegetation
the
callow
grass
between
the
walks
was
the
color
of
verdigris
a
poisonous
green
reminiscent
of
the
horde
of
derelict
humans
that
had
breathed
upon
the
soil
during
the
summer
and
autumn
the
bursting
tree
buds
looked
strangely
familiar
to
those
who
had
botanized
among
the
garnishings
of
the
fish
course
of
a
dinner
the
sky
above
was
of
that
pale
aquamarine
tint
that
ballroom
poets
rhyme
with
true
and
sue
and
coo
the
one
natural
and
frank
color
visible
was
the
ostensible
green
of
the
newly
painted
benches
a
shade
between
the
color
of
a
pickled
cucumber
and
that
of
a
last
year
cravenette
raincoat
but
to
the
eye
of
editor
westbrook
the
landscape
appeared
a
masterpiece
and
now
whether
you
are
of
those
who
rush
in
or
of
the
gentle
concourse
that
fears
to
tread
you
must
follow
in
a
brief
invasion
of
the
editor
mind
editor
westbrook
spirit
was
contented
and
serene
the
april
number
of
the
had
sold
its
entire
edition
before
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
a
newsdealer
in
keokuk
had
written
that
he
could
have
sold
fifty
copies
more
if
he
had
the
owners
of
the
magazine
had
raised
his
the
editor
salary
he
had
just
installed
in
his
home
a
jewel
of
a
recently
imported
cook
who
was
afraid
of
policemen
and
the
morning
papers
had
published
in
full
a
speech
he
had
made
at
a
banquet
also
there
were
echoing
in
his
mind
the
jubilant
notes
of
a
splendid
song
that
his
charming
young
wife
had
sung
to
him
before
he
left
his
apartment
that
morning
she
was
taking
enthusiastic
interest
in
her
music
of
late
practising
early
and
diligently
when
he
had
complimented
her
on
the
improvement
in
her
voice
she
had
fairly
hugged
him
for
joy
at
his
praise
he
felt
too
the
benign
tonic
medicament
of
the
trained
nurse
spring
tripping
softly
adown
the
wards
of
the
convalescent
city
while
editor
westbrook
was
sauntering
between
the
rows
of
park
benches
already
filling
with
vagrants
and
the
guardians
of
lawless
childhood
he
felt
his
sleeve
grasped
and
held
suspecting
that
he
was
about
to
be
panhandled
he
turned
a
cold
and
unprofitable
face
and
saw
that
his
captor
was
dawe
shackleford
dawe
dingy
almost
ragged
the
genteel
scarcely
visible
in
him
through
the
deeper
lines
of
the
shabby
while
the
editor
is
pulling
himself
out
of
his
surprise
a
flashlight
biography
of
dawe
is
offered
he
was
a
fiction
writer
and
one
of
westbrook
old
acquaintances
at
one
time
they
might
have
called
each
other
old
friends
dawe
had
some
money
in
those
days
and
lived
in
a
decent
apartment
house
near
westbrook
the
two
families
often
went
to
theatres
and
dinners
together
dawe
and
westbrook
became
dearest
friends
then
one
day
a
little
tentacle
of
the
octopus
just
to
amuse
itself
ingurgitated
dawe
capital
and
he
moved
to
the
gramercy
park
neighborhood
where
one
for
a
few
groats
per
week
may
sit
upon
trunk
under
chandeliers
and
opposite
carrara
marble
mantels
and
watch
the
mice
play
upon
the
floor
dawe
thought
to
live
by
writing
fiction
now
and
then
he
sold
a
story
he
submitted
many
to
westbrook
the
printed
one
or
two
of
them
the
rest
were
returned
westbrook
sent
a
careful
and
conscientious
personal
letter
with
each
rejected
manuscript
pointing
out
in
detail
his
reasons
for
considering
it
unavailable
editor
westbrook
had
his
own
clear
conception
of
what
constituted
good
fiction
so
had
dawe
dawe
was
mainly
concerned
about
the
constituents
of
the
scanty
dishes
of
food
that
she
managed
to
scrape
together
one
day
dawe
had
been
spouting
to
her
about
the
excellencies
of
certain
french
writers
at
dinner
they
sat
down
to
a
dish
that
a
hungry
schoolboy
could
have
encompassed
at
a
gulp
dawe
commented
it
maupassant
hash
said
dawe
it
may
not
be
art
but
i
do
wish
you
would
do
a
marion
crawford
serial
with
an
ella
wheeler
wilcox
sonnet
for
dessert
i
hungry
as
far
as
this
from
success
was
shackleford
dawe
when
he
plucked
editor
westbrook
sleeve
in
madison
square
that
was
the
first
time
the
editor
had
seen
dawe
in
several
months
why
shack
is
this
you
said
westbrook
somewhat
awkwardly
for
the
form
of
his
phrase
seemed
to
touch
upon
the
other
changed
appearance
sit
down
for
a
minute
said
dawe
tugging
at
his
sleeve
this
is
my
office
i
ca
come
to
yours
looking
as
i
do
oh
sit
down
you
be
disgraced
those
birds
on
the
other
benches
will
take
you
for
a
swell
they
wo
know
you
are
only
an
editor
smoke
shack
said
editor
westbrook
sinking
cautiously
upon
the
virulent
green
bench
he
always
yielded
gracefully
when
he
did
yield
dawe
snapped
at
the
cigar
as
a
kingfisher
darts
at
a
sunperch
or
a
girl
pecks
at
a
chocolate
cream
i
have
just
began
the
editor
oh
i
know
do
finish
said
dawe
give
me
a
match
you
have
just
ten
minutes
to
spare
how
did
you
manage
to
get
past
my
and
invade
my
sanctum
there
he
goes
now
throwing
his
club
at
a
dog
that
could
read
the
off
the
grass
signs
how
goes
the
writing
asked
the
editor
look
at
me
said
dawe
for
your
answer
now
do
put
on
that
embarrassed
look
and
ask
me
why
i
do
get
a
job
as
a
wine
agent
or
a
cab
driver
i
in
the
fight
to
a
finish
i
know
i
can
write
good
fiction
and
i
force
you
fellows
to
admit
it
yet
make
you
change
the
spelling
of
to
before
done
with
you
editor
westbrook
gazed
through
his
with
a
sweetly
sorrowful
omniscient
sympathetic
skeptical
expression
the
copyrighted
expression
of
the
editor
beleagured
by
the
unavailable
contributor
have
you
read
the
last
story
i
sent
you
alarum
of
the
soul
asked
dawe
carefully
i
hesitated
over
that
story
shack
really
i
did
it
had
some
good
points
i
was
writing
you
a
letter
to
send
with
it
when
it
goes
back
to
you
i
regret
never
mind
the
regrets
said
dawe
grimly
there
neither
salve
nor
sting
in
any
more
what
i
want
to
know
is
come
now
out
with
the
good
points
first
the
story
said
westbrook
deliberately
after
a
suppressed
sigh
is
written
around
an
almost
original
plot
characterization
the
best
you
have
done
construction
almost
as
good
except
for
a
few
weak
joints
which
might
be
strengthened
by
a
few
changes
and
touches
it
was
a
good
story
except
i
can
write
english
ca
i
interrupted
dawe
i
have
always
told
you
said
the
editor
that
you
had
a
style
then
the
trouble
is
same
old
thing
said
editor
westbrook
you
work
up
to
your
climax
like
an
artist
and
then
you
turn
yourself
into
a
photographer
i
know
what
form
of
obstinate
madness
possesses
you
but
that
is
what
you
do
with
everything
that
you
write
no
i
will
retract
the
comparison
with
the
photographer
now
and
then
photography
in
spite
of
its
impossible
perspective
manages
to
record
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
truth
but
you
spoil
every
dénouement
by
those
flat
drab
obliterating
strokes
of
your
brush
that
i
have
so
often
complained
of
if
you
would
rise
to
the
literary
pinnacle
of
your
dramatic
senses
and
paint
them
in
the
high
colors
that
art
requires
the
postman
would
leave
fewer
bulky
envelopes
at
your
door
oh
fiddles
and
footlights
cried
dawe
derisively
you
got
that
old
sawmill
drama
kink
in
your
brain
yet
when
the
man
with
the
black
mustache
kidnaps
bessie
you
are
bound
to
have
the
mother
kneel
and
raise
her
hands
in
the
spotlight
and
say
high
heaven
witness
that
i
will
rest
neither
night
nor
day
till
the
heartless
villain
that
has
stolen
me
child
feels
the
weight
of
vengeance
editor
westbrook
conceded
a
smile
of
impervious
complacency
i
think
said
he
that
in
real
life
the
woman
would
express
herself
in
those
words
or
in
very
similar
ones
not
in
a
six
hundred
nights
run
anywhere
but
on
the
stage
said
dawe
hotly
i
tell
you
what
she
say
in
real
life
she
say
bessie
led
away
by
a
strange
man
good
lord
it
one
trouble
after
another
get
my
other
hat
i
must
hurry
around
to
the
why
was
somebody
looking
after
her
i
like
to
know
for
god
sake
get
out
of
my
way
or
i
never
get
ready
not
that
hat
the
brown
one
with
the
velvet
bows
bessie
must
have
been
crazy
she
usually
shy
of
strangers
is
that
too
much
powder
lordy
how
i
upset
that
the
way
she
talk
continued
dawe
people
in
real
life
fly
into
heroics
and
blank
verse
at
emotional
crises
they
simply
do
it
if
they
talk
at
all
on
such
occasions
they
draw
from
the
same
vocabulary
that
they
use
every
day
and
muddle
up
their
words
and
ideas
a
little
more
that
all
shack
said
editor
westbrook
impressively
did
you
ever
pick
up
the
mangled
and
lifeless
form
of
a
child
from
under
the
fender
of
a
street
car
and
carry
it
in
your
arms
and
lay
it
down
before
the
distracted
mother
did
you
ever
do
that
and
listen
to
the
words
of
grief
and
despair
as
they
flowed
spontaneously
from
her
lips
i
never
did
said
dawe
did
you
well
no
said
editor
westbrook
with
a
slight
frown
but
i
can
well
imagine
what
she
would
say
so
can
i
said
dawe
and
now
the
fitting
time
had
come
for
editor
westbrook
to
play
the
oracle
and
silence
his
opinionated
contributor
it
was
not
for
an
unarrived
fictionist
to
dictate
words
to
be
uttered
by
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
the
contrary
to
the
theories
of
the
editor
thereof
my
dear
shack
said
he
if
i
know
anything
of
life
i
know
that
every
sudden
deep
and
tragic
emotion
in
the
human
heart
calls
forth
an
apposite
concordant
conformable
and
proportionate
expression
of
feeling
how
much
of
this
inevitable
accord
between
expression
and
feeling
should
be
attributed
to
nature
and
how
much
to
the
influence
of
art
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
the
sublimely
terrible
roar
of
the
lioness
that
has
been
deprived
of
her
cubs
is
dramatically
as
far
above
her
customary
whine
and
purr
as
the
kingly
and
transcendent
utterances
of
lear
are
above
the
level
of
his
senile
vaporings
but
it
is
also
true
that
all
men
and
women
have
what
may
be
called
a
dramatic
sense
that
is
awakened
by
a
sufficiently
deep
and
powerful
emotion
a
sense
unconsciously
acquired
from
literature
and
the
stage
that
prompts
them
to
express
those
emotions
in
language
befitting
their
importance
and
histrionic
value
and
in
the
name
of
the
seven
sacred
of
sagittarius
where
did
the
stage
and
literature
get
the
stunt
asked
dawe
from
life
answered
the
editor
triumphantly
the
story
writer
rose
from
the
bench
and
gesticulated
eloquently
but
dumbly
he
was
beggared
for
words
with
which
to
formulate
adequately
his
dissent
on
a
bench
nearby
a
frowzy
loafer
opened
his
red
eyes
and
perceived
that
his
moral
support
was
due
a
downtrodden
brother
punch
him
one
jack
he
called
hoarsely
to
dawe
he
come
makin
a
noise
like
a
penny
arcade
for
amongst
that
comes
in
the
square
to
set
and
think
editor
westbrook
looked
at
his
watch
with
an
affected
show
of
leisure
tell
me
asked
dawe
with
truculent
anxiety
what
especial
faults
in
alarum
of
the
soul
caused
you
to
throw
it
down
when
gabriel
murray
said
westbrook
goes
to
his
telephone
and
is
told
that
his
fiancée
has
been
shot
by
a
burglar
he
says
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
words
but
i
do
said
dawe
he
says
central
she
always
cuts
me
off
and
then
to
his
friend
tommy
does
a
bullet
make
a
big
hole
it
kind
of
hard
luck
ai
it
could
you
get
me
a
drink
from
the
sideboard
tommy
no
straight
nothing
on
the
side
and
again
continued
the
editor
without
pausing
for
argument
when
berenice
opens
the
letter
from
her
husband
informing
her
that
he
has
fled
with
the
manicure
girl
her
words
are
let
me
see
she
says
interposed
the
author
what
do
you
think
of
that
absurdly
inappropriate
words
said
westbrook
presenting
an
plunging
the
story
into
hopeless
bathos
worse
yet
they
mirror
life
falsely
no
human
being
ever
uttered
banal
colloquialisms
when
confronted
by
sudden
tragedy
wrong
said
dawe
closing
his
unshaven
jaws
doggedly
i
say
no
man
or
woman
ever
spouts
talk
when
they
go
up
against
a
real
climax
they
talk
naturally
and
a
little
worse
the
editor
rose
from
the
bench
with
his
air
of
indulgence
and
inside
information
say
westbrook
said
dawe
pinning
him
by
the
lapel
would
you
have
accepted
alarum
of
the
soul
if
you
had
believed
that
the
actions
and
words
of
the
characters
were
true
to
life
in
the
parts
of
the
story
that
we
discussed
it
is
very
likely
that
i
would
if
i
believed
that
way
said
the
editor
but
i
have
explained
to
you
that
i
do
not
if
i
could
prove
to
you
that
i
am
right
i
sorry
shack
but
i
afraid
i
have
time
to
argue
any
further
just
now
i
do
want
to
argue
said
dawe
i
want
to
demonstrate
to
you
from
life
itself
that
my
view
is
the
correct
one
how
could
you
do
that
asked
westbrook
in
a
surprised
tone
listen
said
the
writer
seriously
i
have
thought
of
a
way
it
is
important
to
me
that
my
theory
of
fiction
be
recognized
as
correct
by
the
magazines
i
fought
for
it
for
three
years
and
down
to
my
last
dollar
with
two
months
rent
due
i
have
applied
the
opposite
of
your
theory
said
the
editor
in
selecting
the
fiction
for
the
the
circulation
has
gone
up
from
ninety
thousand
to
four
hundred
thousand
said
dawe
whereas
it
should
have
been
boosted
to
a
million
you
said
something
to
me
just
now
about
demonstrating
your
pet
theory
i
will
if
you
give
me
about
half
an
hour
of
your
time
i
prove
to
you
that
i
am
right
i
prove
it
by
louise
your
wife
exclaimed
westbrook
how
well
not
exactly
by
her
but
her
said
dawe
now
you
know
how
devoted
and
loving
louise
has
always
been
she
thinks
i
the
only
genuine
preparation
on
the
market
that
bears
the
old
doctor
signature
she
been
fonder
and
more
faithful
than
ever
since
i
been
cast
for
the
neglected
genius
part
indeed
she
is
a
charming
and
admirable
life
companion
agreed
the
editor
i
remember
what
inseparable
friends
she
and
westbrook
once
were
we
are
both
lucky
chaps
shack
to
have
such
wives
you
must
bring
dawe
up
some
evening
soon
and
we
have
one
of
those
informal
suppers
that
we
used
to
enjoy
so
much
later
said
dawe
when
i
get
another
shirt
and
now
i
tell
you
my
scheme
when
i
was
about
to
leave
home
after
breakfast
if
you
can
call
tea
and
oatmeal
breakfast
louise
told
me
she
was
going
to
visit
her
aunt
in
street
she
said
she
would
return
at
three
she
is
always
on
time
to
a
minute
it
is
now
dawe
glanced
toward
the
editor
watch
pocket
minutes
to
three
said
westbrook
scanning
his
we
have
just
enough
time
said
dawe
we
will
go
to
my
flat
at
once
i
will
write
a
note
address
it
to
her
and
leave
it
on
the
table
where
she
will
see
it
as
she
enters
the
door
you
and
i
will
be
in
the
concealed
by
the
portières
in
that
note
i
say
that
i
have
fled
from
her
forever
with
an
affinity
who
understands
the
needs
of
my
artistic
soul
as
she
never
did
when
she
reads
it
we
will
observe
her
actions
and
hear
her
words
then
we
will
know
which
theory
is
the
correct
one
yours
or
mine
oh
never
exclaimed
the
editor
shaking
his
head
that
would
be
inexcusably
cruel
i
could
not
consent
to
have
dawe
feelings
played
upon
in
such
a
manner
brace
up
said
the
writer
i
guess
i
think
as
much
of
her
as
you
do
it
for
her
benefit
as
well
as
mine
i
got
to
get
a
market
for
my
stories
in
some
way
it
wo
hurt
louise
she
healthy
and
sound
her
heart
goes
as
strong
as
a
watch
it
last
for
only
a
minute
and
then
i
step
out
and
explain
to
her
you
really
owe
it
to
me
to
give
me
the
chance
westbrook
editor
westbrook
at
length
yielded
though
but
half
willingly
and
in
the
half
of
him
that
consented
lurked
the
vivisectionist
that
is
in
all
of
us
let
him
who
has
not
used
the
scalpel
rise
and
stand
in
his
place
pity
is
that
there
are
not
enough
rabbits
and
to
go
around
the
two
experimenters
in
art
left
the
square
and
hurried
eastward
and
then
to
the
south
until
they
arrived
in
the
gramercy
neighborhood
within
its
high
iron
railings
the
little
park
had
put
on
its
smart
coat
of
vernal
green
and
was
admiring
itself
in
its
fountain
mirror
outside
the
railings
the
hollow
square
of
crumbling
houses
shells
of
a
bygone
gentry
leaned
as
if
in
ghostly
gossip
over
the
forgotten
doings
of
the
vanished
quality
transit
gloria
a
block
or
two
north
of
the
park
dawe
steered
the
editor
again
eastward
then
after
covering
a
short
distance
into
a
lofty
but
narrow
flathouse
burdened
with
a
floridly
façade
to
the
fifth
story
they
toiled
and
dawe
panting
pushed
his
into
the
door
of
one
of
the
front
flats
when
the
door
opened
editor
westbrook
saw
with
feelings
of
pity
how
meanly
and
meagerly
the
rooms
were
furnished
get
a
chair
if
you
can
find
one
said
dawe
while
i
hunt
up
pen
and
ink
hello
what
this
here
a
note
from
louise
she
must
have
left
it
there
when
she
went
out
this
morning
he
picked
up
an
envelope
that
lay
on
the
and
tore
it
open
he
began
to
read
the
letter
that
he
drew
out
of
it
and
once
having
begun
it
aloud
he
so
read
it
through
to
the
end
these
are
the
words
that
editor
westbrook
heard
dear
shackleford
by
the
time
you
get
this
i
will
be
about
a
hundred
miles
away
and
still
i
got
a
place
in
the
chorus
of
the
occidental
opera
and
we
start
on
the
road
at
twelve
i
did
want
to
starve
to
death
and
so
i
decided
to
make
my
own
living
i
not
coming
back
westbrook
is
going
with
me
she
said
she
was
tired
of
living
with
a
combination
phonograph
iceberg
and
dictionary
and
she
not
coming
back
either
we
been
practising
the
songs
and
dances
for
two
months
on
the
quiet
i
hope
you
will
be
successful
and
get
along
all
right
louise
dawe
dropped
the
letter
covered
his
face
with
his
trembling
hands
and
cried
out
in
a
deep
vibrating
voice
my
god
why
hast
thou
given
me
this
cup
to
drink
since
she
is
false
then
let
thy
heaven
fairest
gifts
faith
and
love
become
the
jesting
of
traitors
and
fiends
editor
westbrook
glasses
fell
to
the
floor
the
fingers
of
one
hand
fumbled
with
a
button
on
his
coat
as
he
blurted
between
his
pale
lips
say
shack
ai
that
a
hell
of
a
note
would
that
knock
you
off
your
perch
shack
ai
it
hell
now
shack
ai

xx
past
one
at
only
on
the
lower
east
side
of
new
york
do
the
houses
of
capulet
and
montagu
survive
there
they
do
not
fight
by
the
book
of
arithmetic
if
you
but
bite
your
thumb
at
an
upholder
of
your
opposing
house
you
have
work
cut
out
for
your
steel
on

you
may
drag
your
man
along
a
dozen
blocks
by
his
nose
and
he
will
only
bawl
for
the
watch
but
in
the
domain
of
the
east
side
tybalts
and
mercutios
you
must
observe
the
niceties
of
deportment
to
the
wink
of
any
eyelash
and
to
an
inch
of
elbow
room
at
the
bar

when
eddie

known
to
the
capulets
as
cork
mcmanus
drifted
into
dutch
mike
for
a
stein
of
beer
and
came
upon
a
bunch
of
montagus
making
merry
with
the
suds

began
to
observe
the
strictest
parliamentary
rules
courtesy
forbade
his
leaving
the
saloon
with
his
thirst
unslaked
caution
steered
him
to
a
place
at
the
bar
where
the
mirror
supplied
the
cognizance
of
the
enemy
movements
that
his
indifferent
gaze
seemed
to
disdain
experience
whispered
to
him
that
the
finger
of
trouble
would
be
busy
among
the
chattering
steins
at
dutch
mike
that
night
close
by
his
side
drew
brick
cleary
his
mercutio
companion
of
his
perambulations
thus
they
stood
four
of
the
mulberry
hill
gang
and
two
of
the
dry
dock
gang
minding
their
p
and
q
so
solicitously
that
dutch
mike
kept
one
eye
on
his
customers
and
the
other
on
an
open
space
beneath
his
bar
in
which
it
was
his
custom
to
seek
safety
whenever
the
ominous
politeness
of
the
rival
associations
congealed
into
the
shapes
of
bullets
and
cold
steel
but
we
have
not
to
do
with
the
wars
of
the
mulberry
hills
and
the
dry
docks
we
must
to
rooney
where
on
the
most
blighted
dead
branch
of
the
tree
of
life
a
little
pale
orchid
shall
bloom
overstrained
etiquette
at
last
gave

it

overstepped
the

but
the
consequences
were

swiftness

swung
round
from
his
hurricane
deck
but
mcmanus
simile
must
be
the
torpedo
he
glided
in
under
the
guns
and
slipped
a
scant
three
inches
of
knife
blade
between
the
ribs
of
the
mulberry
hill
cruiser
meanwhile
brick
cleary
a
devotee
to

had
skimmed
across
the

counter
and
thrown
the
switch
of
the
electrics
leaving
the
combat
to
be
waged
by
the
light
of

alone
dutch
mike
crawled
from
his
haven
and
ran
into
the
street
crying
for
the
watch
instead
of
for
a

to
immortalize
the

the

and
found

prostrate
bleeding

supported
by
three
distrait
and
reticent
followers
of
the
house
faithful
to
the
ethics
of

no
one
knew
whence
the
hurt
came
there
was
no

be
seen
raus

to
the

sure
i
know
who
done
it
i
always
manages
to
get
a
bird
eye
view
of
any
guy
that
comes
up
an
makes
a
show
case
for
a
hardware
store
out
of
me
no
i
not
telling
you
his

i
settle
with
um
meself
wow
ouch
easy
boys
yes
i
attend
to
his
case
meself
i
not
making
any
complaint
at
midnight
mcmanus
strolled
around
a
pile
of
lumber
near
an
east
side
dock
and
lingered
in
the
vicinity
of
a
certain
water
plug
brick
cleary
drifted
casually
to
the
trysting
place
ten
minutes
later
he
maybe
not
croak
said
brick
and
he
wo
tell
of
course
but
dutch
mike
did
he
told
the
police
he
was
tired
of
having
his
place
shot
up
unhandy
just
now
because
tim
corrigan
in
europe
for
a
week
end
with
kings
he
be
back
on
the
next
friday
you
have
to
duck
out
of
sight
till
then
tim
fix
it
up
all
right
for
us
when
he
comes
back
this
goes
to
explain
why
cork
mcmanus
went
into
rooney
one
night
and
there
looked
upon
the
bright
stranger
face
of
romance
for
the
first
time
in
his
precarious
career
until
tim
corrigan
should
return
from
his
jaunt
among
kings
and
princes
and
hold
up
his
big
white
finger
in
private
offices
it
was
unsafe
for
cork
in
any
of
the
old
haunts
of
his
gang
so
he
lay
perdu
in
the
high
rear
room
of
a
capulet
reading
pink
sporting
sheets
and
cursing
the
slow
paddle
wheels
of
the
it
was
on
thursday
evening
that
cork
seclusion
became
intolerable
to
him
never
a
hart
panted
for
water
fountain
as
he
did
for
the
cool
touch
of
a
drifting
stein
for
the
firm
security
of
a
in
the
hollow
of
his
shoe
and
the
quiet
hearty
challenges
of
friendship
and
repartee
along
and
across
the
shining
bars
but
he
must
avoid
the
district
where
he
was
known
the
cops
were
looking
for
him
everywhere
for
news
was
scarce
and
the
newspapers
were
harping
again
on
the
failure
of
the
police
to
suppress
the
gangs
if
they
got
him
before
corrigan
came
back
the
big
white
finger
could
not
be
uplifted
it
would
be
too
late
then
but
corrigan
would
be
home
the
next
day
so
he
felt
sure
there
would
be
small
danger
in
a
little
excursion
that
night
among
the
crass
pleasures
that
represented
life
to
him
at
twelve
mcmanus
stood
in
a
darkish
street
looking
up
at
the
name
rooney
picked
out
by
incandescent
lights
against
a
signboard
over
a
window
he
had
heard
of
the
place
as
a
tough
with
its
frequenters
and
its
locality
he
was
unfamiliar
guided
by
certain
unerring
indications
common
to
all
such
resorts
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
entered
the
large
room
over
the
café
here
were
some
twenty
or
thirty
tables
at
this
time
about
with
rooney
guests
waiters
served
drinks
at
one
end
a
human
pianola
with
drugged
eyes
hammered
the
keys
with
automatic
and
furious
unprecision
at
merciful
intervals
a
waiter
would
roar
or
squeak
a
song
songs
full
of
johnsons
and
babes
and
coons
historical
word
guaranties
of
the
genuineness
of
african
melodies
composed
by
red
waistcoated
young
gentlemen
natives
of
the
cotton
fields
and
rice
swamps
of
west
street
for
one
brief
moment
you
must
admire
rooney
with
me
as
he
receives
seats
manipulates
and
chaffs
his
guests
he
is
he
has
wellington
nose
dante
chin
the
of
an
iroquois
the
smile
of
talleyrand
corbett
foot

and
the
poise
of
an
east

central
park
queen
of
the
may
he
is
assisted
by
a
lieutenant
known
as
frank
a
pudgy
easy
chap
who
goes
among
the
tables
seeing
that
dull
care
does
not
intrude
now
what
is
there
about
rooney
to
inspire
all
this
pother
it
is
more
respectable
by

stout

and

and
bundles
and
unpedigreed

drop
up
of
afternoons
for
a

and

chat
even
by
gaslight
the
diversions
are
melancholy
i
the
mouth
drink
and
and
an
occasional
surprise
when
the
waiter
swabs
the
suds
from
under
your
sticky
glass
there
is
an
answer
transmigration
the
soul
of
sir
walter
raleigh
has
traveled
from
beneath
his
slashed
doublet
to
a
kindred
home
under

visible

rooney

twenty
years
ahead
of
the
times
rooney

removed
the
embargo
rooney
has
spread
his
cloak
upon
the
soggy
crossing
of
public
opinion
and
any
elizabeth

treads
upon
it

as
much
a

mcmanus
sat
down
at
a
vacant
table
he
paid
for
the
glass
of
beer
that
he
ordered
tilted
his
derby
to
the
back
of
his
head
twined
his
feet
among
the
rungs
of
his
chair
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
contentment
from
the
breathing
spaces
of
his
innermost
soul
for
this
mud
honey
was
clarified
sweetness
to
his
taste
the
sham
gaiety
the
hectic
glow
of
counterfeit
hospitality
the
joyless
laughter
the
warmth
the
loud
music
retrieving
the
hour
from
frequent
whiles
of
awful
and
corroding
silence
the
presence
of
and
beneficiaries
of
rooney
removal
of
the
restrictions
laid
upon
the
weed
the
familiar
blended
odors
of
soaked
lemon
peel
flat
beer
and
all
these
were
manna
to
cork
mcmanus
hungry
for
his
week
in
the
desert
of
the
capulet
high
rear
room
a
girl
alone
entered
rooney
glanced
around
with
leisurely
swiftness
and
sat
opposite
mcmanus
at
his
table
her
eyes
rested
upon
him
for
two
seconds
in
the
look
with
which
woman
reconnoitres
all
men
whom
she
for
the
first
time
confronts
in
that
space
of
time
she
will
decide
upon
one
of
two
things
either
to
scream
for
the
police
or
that
she
may
marry
him
later
on
her
brief
inspection
concluded
the
girl
laid
on
the
table
a
worn
red
morocco
shopping
bag
with
the
inevitable
sail
of
frayed
lace
handkerchief
flying
from
a
corner
of
it
after
she
had
ordered
a
small
beer
from
the
immediate
waiter
she
took
from
her
bag
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
lighted
one
with
slightly
exaggerated
ease
of
manner
then
she
looked
again
in
the
eyes
of
cork
mcmanus
and
smiled
instantly
the
doom
of
each
was
sealed
the
unqualified
desire
of
a
man
to
buy
clothes
and
build
fires
for
a
woman
for
a
whole
lifetime
at
first
sight
of
her
is
not
uncommon
among
that
humble
portion
of
humanity
that
does
not
care
for
bradstreet
or
or
shaw
plays
love
at
first
sight
has
occurred
a
time
or
two
in
high
life
but
as
a
rule
the
extempore
mania
is
to
be
found
among
unsophisticated
creatures
such
as
the
dove
the
dingbat
and
the
clerk
poets
subscribers
to
all
fiction
magazines
and
schatchens
take
notice
with
the
exchange
of
the
mysterious
magnetic
current
came
to
each
of
them
the
instant
desire
to
lie
pretend
dazzle
and
deceive
which
is
the
worst
thing
about
the
hypocritical
disorder
known
as
love
have
another
beer
suggested
cork
in
his
circle
the
phrase
was
considered
to
be
a
card
accompanied
by
a
letter
of
introduction
and
references
no
thanks
said
the
girl
raising
her
eyebrows
and
choosing
her
conventional
words
carefully
i
merely
dropped
in
for
a
slight
refreshment
the
cigarette
between
her
fingers
seemed
to
require
explanation
my
aunt
is
a
russian
lady
she
concluded
and
we
often
have
a
post
perannual
cigarette
after
dinner
at
home
cheese
it
said
cork
whom
society
airs
oppressed
your
fingers
are
as
yellow
as
mine
say
said
the
girl
blazing
upon
him
with
indignation
what
do
you
think
i
am
say
who
do
you
think
you
are
talking
to
what
she
was
pretty
to
look
at
her
eyes
were
big
brown
intrepid
and
bright
under
her
flat
sailor
hat
planted
jauntily
on
one
side
her
crinkly
tawny

drawn
back
low
and
massy
in
a
thick
pendant
knot
behind
the
roundness
of
girlhood
still
lingered
in
her
chin
and
neck
but
her
cheeks
and
fingers
were
thinning
slightly
she
looked
upon
the
world
with
defiance
suspicion
and
sullen
wonder
her
smart
short
tan
coat
was
soiled
and
expensive
two
inches
below
her
black
dress

the
lowest
flounce
of
a

at

the
ubiquitous

in
the
movement
i

with
fine
scrupulosity

company
of

acquainted
with
my
aunt

that
why
said
cork
mcmanus
pulling
his
ear
i
the
latest
thing
in
suitings
with
side
vents
and
bell
skirt
when
it
comes
to
escortin
a
lady
you
bet

me
all
right
ruby
and
i
give
you
a
tip
as
to
who
i
am
my
governor

one
of
the
hottest
of
the
wall
street
push
morgan

casts
a

every
time
the
old
man
sticks
his
head
out
the
window
me
well
i
in

down
the
street
the
old
man
goin
to
put
a
seat
on
the
stock
exchange
in
my
stockin
my
next

but
it
all
sounds
like
a
lemon
to
me
what
i
like
is
golf
and
yachtin
and
er
well
say
a
corkin
fast
bout
between
with
walkin
gloves
i
guess
you
can
walk
to
the
door
with
me
said
the
girl
hesitatingly
but
with
a
certain
pleased
flutter
still
i
never
heard
anything
extra
good
about
wall
street
brokers
or
sports
who
go
to
prize
fights
either
ai
you
got
any
other
recommendations
i
think
you
the
swellest
looker
i
had
my
lamps
on
in
little
old
new
york
said
cork
impressively
that
be
about
enough
of
that
now
ai
you
the
kidder
she
modified
her
chiding
words
by
a
deep
long
beaming
look
at
her
cavalier
we
drink
our
beer
before
we
go
ha
a
waiter
sang
the
tobacco
smoke
grew
denser
drifting
and
rising
in
spirals
waves
tilted
layers
cumulus
clouds
cataracts
and
suspended
fogs
like
some
fifth
element
created
from
the
ribs
of
the
ancient
four
laughter
and
chat
grew
louder
stimulated
by
rooney
liquids
and
rooney
gallant
hospitality
to
lady
nicotine
one
struck
there
was
a
sound
of
closing
and
locking
doors
frank
pulled
down
the
green
shades
of
the
front
windows
carefully
rooney
went
below
in
the
dark
hall
and
stood
at
the
front
door
his
cigarette
cached
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
thenceforth
whoever
might
seek
admittance
must
present
a
countenance
familiar
to
rooney
hawk
eye
the
countenance
of
a
true
sport
cork
mcmanus
and
the
bookbindery
girl
conversed
absorbedly
with
their
elbows
on
the
table
their
glasses
of
beer
were
pushed
to
one
side
scarcely
touched
with
the
foam
on
them
sunken
to
a
thin
white
scum
since
the
stroke
of
one
the
stale
pleasures
of
rooney
had
become
renovated
and
spiced
not
by
any
addition
to
the
list
of
distractions
but
because
from
that
moment
the
sweets
became
stolen
ones
the
flattest
glass
of
beer
acquired
the
tang
of
illegality
the
mildest
claret
punch
struck
a
knockout
blow
at
law
and
order
the
harmless
and
genial
company
became
outlaws
defying
authority
and
rule
for
after
the
stroke
of
one
in
such
places
as
rooney
where
neither
bed
nor
board
is
to
be
had
drink
may
not
be
set
before
the
thirsty
of
the
city
of
the
four
million
it
is
the
law
say
said
cork
mcmanus
almost
covering
the
table
with
his
eloquent
chest
and
elbows
was
that
dead
straight
about
you
workin
in
the
bookbindery
and
livin
at
home
and
just
happenin
in
here
and
and
all
that
spiel

with
spirit

down
to
the
shop
and

after
midnight

the
girl
flushed
a
little
and
lowered
her
eyes
i
see
that
now
she
said
meekly
i
did
know
how
bad
it
looked
but
i
wo
do
it
any
more
and
i
go
straight
home
every
night
and
stay
there
and
give
up
cigarettes
if

eddie
i
cut
out
from
this
minute
on
cork
air
became
judicial
proprietary
condemnatory
yet
sympathetic
a
lady

smoke
he
decided
slowly
at
times
and
places
why
because
it
bein
a
lady
that
helps
her
pull
it
off
i
going
to
quit
there
nothing
to
it
said
the
girl
she
flicked
the
stub
of
her
cigarette
to
the
floor
at
times
and
places
repeated
cork
when
i
call
round
for
you
of

hunt

a
dark
bench
in
stuyvesant
square
and

see
eddie

the
girl
searched
his
hard
but
frank
features
eagerly
with
anxious
eyes
on
the
dead
level
when
are
you

to
see
me

like
to
me
honest
you
do
i
know
when
i
suited
on
the
dead
level
i
do
against
the
front
door
repeated
heavy
blows
were
delivered
the
loud
crashes
resounded
in
the
room
above
only
a
or
a
policeman
foot
could
have
been
the
author
of
those
sounds
rooney
jumped
like
a
bullfrog
to
a
corner
of
the
room
turned
off
the
electric
lights
and
hurried
swiftly
below
the
room
was
left
utterly
dark
except
for
the
winking
red
glow
of
cigars
and
cigarettes
a
second
volley
of
crashes
came
up
from
the
assaulted
door
a
little
rustling
murmuring
panic
moved
among
the
besieged
guests
frank
cool
smooth
reassuring
could
be
seen
in
the
rosy
glow
of
the
burning
tobacco
going
from
table
to
table
all
keep
still
was
his
caution
do
talk
or
make
any
noise
everything
will
be
all
right
now
do
feel
the
slightest
alarm
take
care
of
you
all
ruby
felt
across
the
table
until
cork
firm
hand
closed
upon
hers
are
you
afraid
eddie
she
whispered
are
you
afraid
you
get
a
free
ride

cork
i
guess
rooney
been
slow
with
his
envelope
do
you
worry
girly
i
look
out
for
you
all
right
yet
mcmanus
ease
was
only
and
with
the
police
looking
everywhere
for
buck
malone
assailant
and
with
corrigan
still
on
the
ocean
wave
he
felt
that
to
be
caught
in
a
police
raid
would
mean
an
ended
career
for
him
he
wished
he
had
remained
in
the
high
rear
room
of
the
true
capulet
reading
the
pink
extras
rooney
seemed
to
have
opened
the
front
door
below
and
engaged
the
police
in
conference
in
the
dark
hall
the
wordless
low
growl
of
their
voices
came
up
the
stairway
frank
made
a
wireless
news
station
of
himself
at
the
upper
door
suddenly
he
closed
the
door
hurried
to
the
extreme
rear
of
the
room
and
lighted
a
dim
gas
jet
this
way
everybody
he
called
sharply
in
a
hurry
but
no
noise
please
the
guests
crowded
in
confusion
to
the
rear
rooney
lieutenant
swung
open
a
panel
in
the
wall
overlooking
the
back
yard
revealing
a
ladder
already
placed
for
the
escape
down
and
out
everybody
he
commanded
ladies
first
less
talking
please
do
crowd
there
no
danger
among
the
last
cork
and
ruby
waited
their
turn
at
the
open
panel
suddenly
she
swept
him
aside
and
clung
to
his
arm
fiercely
before
we
go
out
she
whispered
in
his
ear
before
anything
happens
tell
me
again
eddie
do
you
l
do
you
really
like
me
on
the
dead
level
said
cork
holding
her
close
with
one
arm
when
it
comes
to
you
i
all
in
when
they
turned
they
found
they
were
lost
and
in
darkness
the
last
of
the
fleeing
customers
had
descended
half
way
across
the
yard
they
bore
the
ladder
stumbling
giggling
hurrying
to
place
it
against
an
adjoining
low
building
over
the
roof
of
which
their
only
route
to
safety
we
may
as
well
sit
down
said
cork
grimly
maybe
rooney
will
stand
the
cops
off
anyhow
they
sat
at
a
table
and
their
hands
came
together
again
a
number
of
men
then
entered
the
dark
room
feeling
their
way
about
one
of
them
rooney
himself
found
the
switch
and
turned
on
the
electric
light
the
other
man
was
a
cop
of
the
old
régime
a
big
cop
a
thick
cop
a
fuming
abrupt
cop
not
a
pretty
cop
he
went
up
to
the
pair
at
the
table
and
sneered
familiarly
at
the
girl
what
are
youse
doin
in
here
he
asked
dropped
in
for
a
smoke
said
cork
mildly
had
any
drinks
not
later
than
one
get
out
quick
ordered
the
cop
then
sit
down
he
countermanded
he
took
off
cork
hat
roughly
and
scrutinized
him
shrewdly
your
name
mcmanus
bad
guess
said
cork
it
peterson
cork
mcmanus
or
something
like
that
said
the
cop
you
put
a
knife
into
a
man
in
dutch
mike
saloon
a
week
ago
aw
forget
it
said
cork
who
perceived
a
shade
of
doubt
in
the
officer
tones
you
got
my
mug
mixed
with
somebody
else
have
i
well

to
the
station

over

description

all
right
the
cop
twisted
his
fingers
under
cork
collar
come
on
he
ordered
roughly
cork
glanced
at
ruby
she
was
pale
and
her
thin
nostrils
quivered
her
quick
eye
danced
from
one
man
face
to
the
other
as
they
spoke
or
moved
what
hard
luck
cork
was
thinking
corrigan
on
the
briny
and
ruby
met
and
lost
almost
within
an
hour
somebody
at
the
police
station
would
recognize
him
without
a
doubt
hard
luck
but
suddenly
the
girl
sprang
up
and
hurled
herself
with
both
arms
extended
against
the
cop
his
hold
on
cork
collar
was
loosened
and
he
stumbled
back
two
or
three
paces
do
go
so
fast
maguire
she
cried
in
shrill
fury
keep
your
hands
off
my
man

ai
the
man

the
girl
flaming
red
and
white
by
turns
because
i
known
him
a
year
he
mine
ought
i
to
know
and
what
am
i
doin
here
with
him
that
easy
she
stooped
low
and
reached
down
somewhere
into
a
swirl
of
flirted
draperies
heliotrope
and
black
an
elastic
snapped
she
threw
on
the
table
toward
cork
a
folded
wad
of
bills
the
money
slowly
straightened
itself
with
little
leisurely
jerks
take
that
jimmy
and
let
go
said
the
girl
i
declarin
the
usual
dividends
maguire
she
said
to
the
officer
you
had
your
usual
graft
at
the
usual
corner
at
ten
a
lie

the
cop
turning
purple
you

beat
again
and
arrest
you
every
time

said
the
girl
and

and

the
wad
of
money
carefully
into
his
pocket
and
said

before

go
home
clear
out
quick
both
of
you
or
i
the
cop
bluster
trailed
away
into
inconsequentiality
at
the
corner
of
the
street
the
two
halted
cork
handed
back
the
money
without
a
word
the
girl
took
it
and
slipped
it
slowly
into
her
her
expression
was
the
same
she
had
worn
when
she
entered
rooney
that
night
she
looked
upon
the
world
with
defiance
suspicion
and
sullen
wonder
i
guess
i
might
as
well
say
here
she
said
dully
you
want
to
see
me
again
of
course
will
you
shake
hands
mr
mcmanus
i
might
have
got
wise
if

snap

said
cork
why
did
you
do
it
you
have
been
pinched
if
i
had
that
why
ai
that
reason
enough
then
she
began
to
cry
honest
eddie
i
was
goin
to
be
the
best
girl
in
the
world
i
hated
to
be
what
i
am
i
hated
men
i
was
ready
almost
to
die
when
i
saw
you
and
you
seemed
different
from
everybody
else
and
when
i
found
you
liked
me
too
why
i
thought
make
you
believe
i
was
good
and
i
was
goin
to
be
good
when
you
asked
to
come
to
my
house
and
see
me
why
i
have
died
rather
than
do
anything
wrong
after
that
but
what
the
use
of
talking
about
it
say
if
you
will
mr
mcmanus
cork
was
pulling
at
his
ear
i
knifed
malone
said
he
i
was
the
one
the
cop
wanted
oh

said
the
girl
listlessly
it
did
make
any
difference
about
that
that
was
all
hot
air
about
wall
street
i
do
do
nothin
but
hang
out
with
a
tough
gang
on
the
east
side
that

repeated
the
girl
it
did
make
any
difference
cork
straightened
himself
and
pulled
his
hat
down
low
i
could
get
a
job
at
he
said
aloud
but
to
himself
said
the
girl
come
on
said
cork
taking
her
arm
i
know
a
place
two
blocks
away
he
turned
with
her
up
the
steps
of

the

itself
on

spreading

of
the

if
it

first
you
must
take
your
seat
in
the
observation
car
for
one
moment
it
is
for
no
longer
than
to
consider
a
brief
essay
on
the
subject
let
us
call
it
what
around
the
corner
mundus
in

divisum
men

who

there
are
no

by
the

overshoes
are
out

the

developed
into

the

will
be
paralleling
the

with

railways
fortune
chance
and
adventure
are
given
as
synonymous
in
the
dictionaries
to
the
knowing
each
has
a
different
meaning
fortune
is
a
prize
to
be
won
adventure
is
the
road
to
it
chance
is
what
may
lurk
in
the
shadows
at
the
roadside
the
face
of
fortune
is
radiant
and
alluring
that
of
adventure
is
flushed
and
heroic
the
face
of
chance
is
the
beautiful
countenance
perfect
because
vague
and
that
we
see
in
our
at
breakfast
while
we
growl
over
our
chops
and
toast
the
venturer
is
one
who
keeps
his
eye
on
the
hedgerows
and
wayside
groves
and
meadows
while
he
travels
the
road
to
fortune
that
is
the
difference
between
him
and
the
adventurer
eating
the
forbidden
fruit
was
the
best
record
ever
made
by
a
venturer
trying
to
prove
that
it
happened
is
the
highest
work
of
the
adventuresome
to
be
either
is
disturbing
to
the
cosmogony
of
creation
so
as
and
citizens
let
us
light
our
pipes
chide
the
children
and
the
cat
arrange
ourselves
in
the
willow
rocker
under
the
flickering
gas
jet
at
the
coolest
window
and
scan
this
little
tale
of
two
modern
followers
of
chance
did
you
ever
hear
that
story
about
the
man
from
the
west
asked
billinger
in
the
little
room
to
your
left
as
you
penetrate
the
interior
of
the
powhatan
club
doubtless
said
john
reginald
forster
rising
and
leaving
the
room
forster
got
his
straw
hat
straws
will
be
in
and
maybe
out
again
long
before
this
is
printed
from
the
checkroom
boy
and
walked
out
of
the
air
as
hamlet
says
billinger
was
used
to
having
his
stories
insulted
and
would
not
mind
forster
was
in
his
favorite
mood
and
wanted
to
go
away
from
anywhere
a
man
in
order
to
get
on
good
terms
with
himself
must
have
his
opinions
corroborated
and
his
moods
matched
by
some
one
else
i
had
written
that
somebody
but
an
boy
who
once
took
a
telegram
for
me
pointed
out
that
i
could
save
money
by
using
the
compound
word
this
is
a
vice
versa
case
forster
favorite
mood
was
that
of
greatly
desiring
to
be
a
follower
of
chance
he
was
a
venturer
by
nature
but
convention
birth
tradition
and
the
narrowing
influences
of
the
tribe
of
manhattan
had
denied
him
full
privilege
he
had
trodden
all
the
thoroughfares
and
many
of
the
side
roads
that
are
supposed
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
life
but
none
had
sufficed
the
reason
was
that
he
knew
what
was
to
be
found
at
the
end
of
every
street
he
knew
from
experience
and
logic
almost
precisely
to
what
end
each
digression
from
routine
must
lead
he
found
a
depressing
monotony
in
all
the
variations
that
the
music
of
his
sphere
had
grafted
upon
the
tune
of
life
he
had
not
learned
that
although
the
world
was
made
round
the
circle
has
been
squared
and
that
it
true
interest
is
to
be
in
what
around
the
corner
forster
walked
abroad
aimlessly
from
the
powhatan
trying
not
to
tax
either
his
judgment
or
his
desire
as
to
what
streets
he
traveled
he
would
have
been
glad
to
lose
his
way
if
it
were
possible
but
he
had
no
hope
of
that
adventure
and
fortune
move
at
your
beck
and
call
in
the
greater
city
but
chance
is
oriental
she
is
a
veiled
lady
in
a
sedan
chair
protected
by
a
special
traffic
squad
of
dragonians
crosstown
uptown
and
downtown
you
may
move
without
seeing
her
at
the
end
of
an
hour
stroll
forster
stood
on
a
corner
of
a
broad
smooth
avenue
looking
disconsolately
across
it
at
a
picturesque
old
hotel
softly
but
brilliantly
lit
disconsolately
because
he
knew
that
he
must
dine
and
dining
in
that
hotel
was
no
venture
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
caravansaries
and
so
silent
and
swift
would
be
the
service
and
so
delicately
choice
the
food
that
he
regretted
the
hunger
that
must
be
appeased
by
the
dead
perfection
of
the
place
cuisine
even
the
music
there
seemed
to
be
always
playing
fancy
came
to
him
that
he
would
dine
at
some
cheap
even
dubious
restaurant
lower
down
in
the
city
where
the
erratic
chefs
from
all
countries
of
the
world
spread
their
national
cookery
for
the
omnivorous
american
something
might
happen
there
out
of
the
routine
he
might
come
upon
a
subject
without
a
predicate
a
road
without
an
end
a
question
without
an
answer
a
cause
without
an
effect
a
gulf
stream
in
salt
ocean
he
had
not
dressed
for
evening
he
wore
a
dark
business
suit
that
would
not
be
questioned
even
where
the
waiters
served
the
spaghetti
in
their
shirt
sleeves
so
john
reginald
forster
began
to
search
his
clothes
for
money
because
the
more
cheaply
you
dine
the
more
surely
must
you
pay
all
of
the
thirteen
pockets
large
and
small
of
his
business
suit
he
explored
carefully
and
found
not
a
penny
his
bank
book
showed
a
balance
of
five
figures
to
his
credit
in
the
old
ironsides
trust
company
but
forster
became
aware
of
a
man
nearby
at
his
left
hand
who
was
really
regarding
him
with
some
amusement
he
looked
like
any
business
man
of
thirty
or
so
neatly
dressed
and
standing
in
the
attitude
of
one
waiting
for
a
street
car
but
there
was
no
car
line
on
that
avenue
so
his
proximity
and
unconcealed
curiosity
seemed
to
forster
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
a
personal
intrusion
but
as
he
was
a
consistent
seeker
after
what
around
the
corner
instead
of
manifesting
resentment
he
only
turned
a
smile
upon
the
other
grin
of
amusement
all
in
asked
the
intruder
drawing
nearer
seems
so
said
forster
now
i
thought
there
was
a
dollar
in
oh
i
know
said
the
other
man
with
a
laugh
but
there
was
just
been
through
the
same
process
myself
as
i
was
coming
around
the
corner
i
found
in
an
upper
vest
pocket
i
do
know
how
they
got
there
exactly
two
pennies
you
know
what
kind
of
a
dinner
exactly
two
pennies
will
buy
you
have
dined
then
asked
forster
i
have
not
but
i
would
like
to
now
i
make
you
a
proposition
you
look
like
a
man
who
would
take
up
one
your
clothes
look
neat
and
respectable
excuse
personalities
i
think
mine
will
pass
the
scrutiny
of
a
head
waiter
also
suppose
we
go
over
to
that
hotel
and
dine
together
we
will
choose
from
the
menu
like
millionaires
or
if
you
prefer
like
gentlemen
in
moderate
circumstances
dining
extravagantly
for
once
when
we
have
finished
we
will
match
with
my
two
pennies
to
see
which
of
us
will
stand
the
brunt
of
the
house
displeasure
and
vengeance
my
name
is
ives
i
think
we
have
lived
in
the
same
station
of
life
before
our
money
took
wings
you
on
said
forster
joyfully
here
was
a
venture
at
least
within
the
borders
of
the
mysterious
country
of
chance
anyhow
it
promised
something
better
than
the
stale
infestivity
of
a
table
the
two
were
soon
seated
at
a
corner
table
in
the
hotel
dining
room
ives
chucked
one
of
his
pennies
across
the
table
to
forster
match
for
which
of
us
gives
the
order
he
said
forster
lost
ives
laughed
and
began
to
name
liquids
and
viands
to
the
waiter
with
the
absorbed
but
calm
deliberation
of
one
who
was
to
the
menu
born
forster
listening
gave
his
admiring
approval
of
the
order
i
am
a
man
said
ives
during
the
oysters
who
has
made
a
lifetime
search
after
the
i
am
not
like
the
ordinary
adventurer
who
strikes
for
a
coveted
prize
nor
yet
am
i
like
a
gambler
who
knows
he
is
either
to
win
or
lose
a
certain
set
stake
what
i
want
is
to
encounter
an
adventure
to
which
i
can
predict
no
conclusion
it
is
the
breath
of
existence
to
me
to
dare
fate
in
its
blindest
manifestations
the
world
has
come
to
run
so
much
by
rote
and
gravitation
that
you
can
enter
upon
hardly
any
footpath
of
chance
in
which
you
do
not
find
signboards
informing
you
of
what
you
may
expect
at
its
end
i
am
like
the
clerk
in
the
circumlocution
office
who
always
complained
bitterly
when
any
one
came
in
to
ask
information
wanted
to
you
know
was
the
kick
he
made
to
his
well
i
do
want
to
know
i
do
want
to
reason
i
do
want
to
guess
i
want
to
bet
my
hand
without
seeing
it
i
understand
said
forster
delightedly
i
often
wanted
the
way
i
feel
put
into
words
you
done
it
i
want
to
take
chances
on
coming
suppose
we
have
a
bottle
of
moselle
with
the
next
course
agreed
said
ives
i
glad
you
catch
my
idea
it
will
increase
the
animosity
of
the
house
toward
the
loser
if
it
does
not
weary
you
we
will
pursue
the
theme
only
a
few
times
have
i
met
a
true
venturer
one
who
does
not
ask
a
schedule
and
map
from
fate
when
he
begins
a
journey
but
as
the
world
becomes
more
civilized
and
wiser
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
come
upon
an
adventure
the
end
of
which
you
can
not
foresee
in
the
elizabethan
days
you
could
assault
the
watch
wring
knockers
from
doors
and
have
a
jolly
with
the
blades
in
any
convenient
angle
of
a
wall
and
away
with
it
nowadays
if
you
speak
disrespectfully
to
a
policeman
all
that
is
left
to
the
most
romantic
fancy
is
to
conjecture
in
what
particular
police
station
he
will
land
you
i
know
i
know
said
forster
nodding
approval
i
returned
to
new
york
continued
ives
from
a
three
ramble
around
the
globe
things
are
not
much
better
abroad
than
they
are
at
home
the
whole
world
seems
to
be
overrun
by
conclusions
the
only
thing
that
interests
me
greatly
is
a
premise
i
tried
shooting
big
game
in
africa
i
know
what
an
express
rifle
will
do
at
so
many
yards
and
when
an
elephant
or
a
rhinoceros
falls
to
the
bullet
i
enjoy
it
about
as
much
as
i
did
when
i
was
kept
in
after
school
to
do
a
sum
in
long
division
on
the
blackboard
i
know
i
know
said
forster
there
might
be
something
in
aeroplanes
went
on
ives
reflectively
i
tried
ballooning
but
it
seems
to
be
merely
a
affair
of
wind
and
ballast
women
suggested
forster
with
a
smile
three
months
ago
said
ives
i
was
pottering
around
in
one
of
the
bazaars
in
constantinople
i
noticed
a
lady
veiled
of
course
but
with
a
pair
of
especially
fine
eyes
visible
who
was
examining
some
amber
and
pearl
ornaments
at
one
of
the
booths
with
her
was
an
attendant
a
big
nubian
as
black
as
coal
after
a
while
the
attendant
drew
nearer
to
me
by
degrees
and
slipped
a
scrap
of
paper
into
my
hand
i
looked
at
it
when
i
got
a
chance
on
it
was
scrawled
hastily
in
pencil
arched
gate
of
the
nightingale
garden
at
nine
does
that
appear
to
you
to
be
an
interesting
premise
mr
forster
i
made
inquiries
and
learned
that
the
nightingale
garden
was
the
property
of
an
old
turk
a
grand
vizier
or
something
of
the
sort
of
course
i
prospected
for
the
arched
gate
and
was
there
at
nine
the
same
nubian
attendant
opened
the
gate
promptly
on
time
and
i
went
inside
and
sat
on
a
bench
by
a
perfumed
fountain
with
the
veiled
lady
we
had
quite
an
extended
chat
she
was
myrtle
thompson
a
lady
journalist
who
was
writing
up
the
turkish
harems
for
a
chicago
newspaper
she
said
she
noticed
the
new
york
cut
of
my
clothes
in
the
bazaar
and
wondered
if
i
could
work
something
into
the
metropolitan
papers
about
it
i
see
said
forster
i
see
i
canoed
through
canada
said
ives
down
many
rapids
and
over
many
falls
but
i
did
seem
to
get
what
i
wanted
out
of
it
because
i
knew
there
were
only
two
possible
outcomes
i
would
either
go
to
the
bottom
or
arrive
at
the
sea
level
i
played
all
games
at
cards
but
the
mathematicians
have
spoiled
that
sport
by
computing
the
percentages
i
made
acquaintances
on
trains
i
answered
advertisements
rung
strange
i
taken
every
chance
that
presented
itself
but
there
has
always
been
the
conventional
ending
the
logical
conclusion
to
the
premise
i
know
repeated
forster
i
felt
it
all
but
i
had
few
chances
to
take
my
chance
at
chances
is
there
any
life
so
devoid
of
impossibilities
as
life
in
this
city
there
seems
to
be
a
myriad
of
opportunities
for
testing
the
undeterminable
but
not
one
in
a
thousand
fails
to
land
you
where
you
expected
it
to
stop
i
wish
the
subways
and
street
cars
disappointed
one
as
seldom
the
sun
has
risen
said
ives
on
the
arabian
nights
there
are
no
more
caliphs
the
fisherman
vase
is
turned
to
a
vacuum
bottle
warranted
to
keep
any
genie
boiling
or
frozen
for
hours
life
moves
by
rote
science
has
killed
adventure
there
are
no
more
opportunities
such
as
columbus
and
the
man
who
ate
the
first
oyster
had
the
only
certain
thing
is
that
there
is
nothing
uncertain
well
said
forster
my
experience
has
been
the
limited
one
of
a
city
man
i
have
seen
the
world
as
you
have
but
it
seems
that
we
view
it
with
the
same
opinion
but
i
tell
you
i
am
grateful
for
even
this
little
venture
of
ours
into
the
borders
of
the
haphazard
there
may
be
at
least
one
breathless
moment
when
the
bill
for
the
dinner
is
presented
perhaps
after
all
the
pilgrims
who
traveled
without
scrip
or
purse
found
a
keener
taste
to
life
than
did
the
knights
of
the
round
table
who
rode
abroad
with
a
retinue
and
king
arthur
certified
checks
in
the
lining
of
their
helmets
and
now
if
you
finished
your
coffee
suppose
we
match
one
of
your
insufficient
coins
for
the
impending
blow
of
fate
what
have
i
up
heads
called
ives
heads
it
is
said
forster
lifting
his
hand
i
lose
we
forgot
to
agree
upon
a
plan
for
the
winner
to
escape
i
suggest
that
when
the
waiter
comes
you
make
a
remark
about
telephoning
to
a
friend
i
will
hold
the
fort
and
the
dinner
check
long
enough
for
you
to
get
your
hat
and
be
off
i
thank
you
for
an
evening
out
of
the
ordinary
ives
and
wish
we
might
have
others
if
my
memory
is
not
at
fault
said
ives
laughing
the
nearest
police
station
is
in
macdougal
street
i
have
enjoyed
the
dinner
too
let
me
assure
you
forster
crooked
his
finger
for
the
waiter
victor
with
a
locomotive
effort
that
seemed
to
owe
more
to
pneumatics
than
to
pedestrianism
glided
to
the
table
and
laid
the
card
face
downward
by
the
cup
forster
took
it
up
and
added
the
figures
with
deliberate
care
ives
leaned
back
comfortably
in
his
chair
excuse
me
said
forster
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ring
grimes
about
that
theatre
party
for
thursday
night
had
you
forgotten
about
it
oh
said
ives
settling
himself
more
comfortably
i
can
do
that
later
on
get
me
a
glass
of
water
waiter
want
to
be
in
at
the
death
do
you
asked
forster
i
hope
you
do
object
said
ives
pleadingly
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
a
gentleman
arrested
in
a
public
restaurant
for
swindling
it
out
of
a
dinner
all
right
said
forster
calmly
you
are
entitled
to
see
a
christian
die
in
the
arena
as
your
victor
came
with
the
glass
of
water
and
remained
with
the
disengaged
air
of
an
inexorable
collector
forster
hesitated
for
fifteen
seconds
and
then
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
scribbled
his
name
on
the
dinner
check
the
waiter
bowed
and
took
it
away
the
fact
is
said
forster
with
a
little
embarrassed
laugh
i
doubt
whether
i
what
they
call
a
sport
which
means
the
same
as
a
of
fortune
i
have
to
make
a
confession
i
been
dining
at
this
hotel
two
or
three
times
a
week
for
more
than
a
year
i
always
sign
my
checks
and
then
with
a
note
of
appreciation
in
his
voice
it
was
of
you
to
stay
to
see
me
through
with
it
when
you
knew
i
had
no
money
and
that
you
might
be
scooped
in
too
i
guess
i
confess
too
said
ives
with
a
grin
i
own
the
hotel
i
do
run
it
of
course
but
i
always
keep
a
suite
on
the
third
floor
for
my
use
when
i
happen
to
stray
into
town
he
called
a
waiter
and
said
is
gilmore
still
behind
the
desk
all
right
tell
him
that
ives
is
here
and
ask
him
to
have
my
rooms
made
ready
and
aired
another
venture
cut
short
by
the
inevitable
said
forster
is
there
a
conundrum
without
an
answer
in
the
next
number
but
let
hold
to
our
subject
just
for
a
minute
or
two
if
you
will
it
is
often
that
i
meet
a
man
who
understands
the
flaws
i
pick
in
existence
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
a
month
from
i
reserve
comment
said
ives
right
i
am
going
to
add
to
the
assertion
i
am
devotedly
fond
of
the
lady
but
i
ca
decide
whether
to
show
up
at
the
church
or
make
a
sneak
for
alaska
it
the
same
idea
you
know
that
we
were
discussing
it
does
for
a
fellow
as
far
as
possibilities
are
concerned
everybody
knows
the
routine
you
get
a
kiss
flavored
with
ceylon
tea
after
breakfast
you
go
to
the
office
you
come
back
home
and
dress
for
dinner
theatre
twice
a
week
bills
moping
around
most
evenings
trying
to
make
conversation
a
little
quarrel
occasionally
maybe
sometimes
a
big
one
and
a
separation
or
else
a
settling
down
into
a
contentment
which
is
worst
of
all
i
know
said
ives
nodding
wisely
it
the
dead
certainty
of
the
thing
went
on
forster
that
keeps
me
in
doubt
there
nevermore
be
anything
around
the
corner
nothing
after
the
church
said
ives
i
know
understand
said
forster
that
i
am
in
no
doubt
as
to
my
feelings
toward
the
lady
i
may
say
that
i
love
her
truly
and
deeply
but
there
is
something
in
the
current
that
runs
through
my
veins
that
cries
out
against
any
form
of
the
calculable
i
do
not
know
what
i
want
but
i
know
that
i
want
it
i
talking
like
an
idiot
i
suppose
but
i
sure
of
what
i
mean
i
understand
you
said
ives
with
a
slow
smile
well
i
think
i
will
be
going
up
to
my
rooms
now
if
you
would
dine
with
me
here
one
evening
soon
forster
i
be
glad
thursday
suggested
forster
at
seven
if
it
convenient
answered
ives
seven
goes
assented
forster
at
eight
ives
got
into
a
cab
and
was
driven
to
a
number
in
one
of
the
correct
west
seventies
his
card
admitted
him
to
the
reception
room
of
an
house
into
which
the
spirits
of
fortune
chance
and
adventure
had
never
dared
to
enter
on
the
walls
were
the
whistler
etchings
the
steel
engravings
by
the
paintings
of
the
grapes
and
garden
truck
with
the
watermelon
seeds
spilled
on
the
table
as
natural
as
life
and
the
greuze
head
it
was
a
household
there
was
even
brass
andirons
on
a
table
was
an
album
with
protections
on
the
corners
of
the
lids
a
clock
on
the
mantel
ticked
loudly
with
a
warning
click
at
five
minutes
to
nine
ives
looked
at
it
curiously
remembering
a
in
his
grandmother
home
that
gave
such
a
warning
and
then
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
room
came
mary
marsden
she
was
and
i
leave
her
to
your
imagination
but
i
must
say
this
much
youth
and
health
and
simplicity
and
courage
and
eyes
are
beautiful
and
she
had
all
these
she
gave
ives
her
hand
with
the
sweet
cordiality
of
an
old
friendship
you
ca
think
what
a
pleasure
it
is
she
said
to
have
you
drop
in
once
every
three
years
or
so
for
half
an
hour
they
talked
i
confess
that
i
can
not
repeat
the
conversation
you
will
find
it
in
books
in
the
circulating
library
when
that
part
of
it
was
over
mary
said
and
did
you
find
what
you
wanted
while
you
were
abroad
what
i
wanted
said
ives
yes
you
know
you
were
always
queer
even
as
a
boy
you
would
play
marbles
or
baseball
or
any
game
with
rules
you
wanted
to
dive
in
water
where
you
did
know
whether
it
was
ten
inches
or
ten
feet
deep
and
when
you
grew
up
you
were
just
the
same
we
often
talked
about
your
peculiar
ways
i
suppose
i
am
an
incorrigible
said
ives
i
am
opposed
to
the
doctrine
of
predestination
to
the
rule
of
three
gravitation
taxation
and
everything
of
the
kind
life
has
always
seemed
to
me
something
like
a
serial
story
would
be
if
they
printed
above
each
instalment
a
synopsis
of
chapters
mary
laughed
merrily
bob
ames
told
us
once
she
said
of
a
funny
thing
you
did
it
was
when
you
and
he
were
on
a
train
in
the
south
and
you
got
off
at
a
town
where
you
had
intended
to
stop
just
because
the
brakeman
hung
up
a
sign
in
the
end
of
the
car
with
the
name
of
the
next
station
on
it
i
remember
said
ives
that
station
has
been
the
thing
always
tried
to
get
away
from
i
know
it
said
mary
and
you
been
very
foolish
i
hope
you
find
what
you
wanted
not
to
find
or
get
off
at
the
station
where
there
was
any
or
whatever
it
was
you
expected
would
happen
to
you
during
the
three
years
you
been
away
there
was
something
i
wanted
before
i
went
away
said
ives
mary
looked
in
his
eyes
clearly
with
a
slight
but
perfectly
sweet
smile
there
was
she
said
you
wanted
me
and
you
could
have
had
me
as
you
very
well
know
without
replying
ives
let
his
gaze
wander
slowly
about
the
room
there
had
been
no
change
in
it
since
last
he
had
been
in
it
three
years
before
he
vividly
recalled
the
thoughts
that
had
been
in
his
mind
then
the
contents
of
that
room
were
as
fixed
in
their
way
as
the
everlasting
hills
no
change
would
ever
come
there
except
the
inevitable
ones
wrought
by
time
and
decay
that
album
would
occupy
that
corner
of
that
table
those
pictures
would
hang
on
the
walls
those
chairs
be
found
in
their
same
places
every
morn
and
noon
and
night
while
the
household
hung
together
the
brass
andirons
were
monuments
to
order
and
stability
here
and
there
were
relics
of
a
hundred
years
ago
which
were
still
living
mementos
and
would
be
for
many
years
to
come
one
going
from
and
coming
back
to
that
house
would
never
need
to
forecast
or
doubt
he
would
find
what
he
left
and
leave
what
he
found
the
veiled
lady
chance
would
never
lift
her
hand
to
the
knocker
on
the
outer
door
and
before
him
sat
the
lady
who
belonged
in
the
room
cool
and
sweet
and
unchangeable
she
was
she
offered
no
surprises
if
one
should
pass
his
life
with
her
though
she
might
grow
and
wrinkled
he
would
never
perceive
the
change
three
years
he
had
been
away
from
her
and
she
was
still
waiting
for
him
as
established
and
constant
as
the
house
itself
he
was
sure
that
she
had
once
cared
for
him
it
was
the
knowledge
that
she
would
always
do
so
that
had
driven
him
away
thus
his
thoughts
ran
i
am
going
to
be
married
soon
said
mary
on
the
next
thursday
afternoon
forster
came
hurriedly
to
ive
hotel
old
man
said
he
we
have
to
put
that
dinner
off
for
a
year
or
so
i
going
abroad
the
steamer
sails
at
four
that
was
a
great
talk
we
had
the
other
night
and
it
decided
me
i
going
to
knock
around
the
world
and
get
rid
of
that
incubus
that
has
been
weighing
on
both
you
and
me
the
terrible
dread
of
knowing
what
going
to
happen
i
done
one
thing
that
hurts
my
conscience
a
little
but
i
know
it
best
for
both
of
us
i
written
to
the
lady
to
whom
i
was
engaged
and
explained
everything
told
her
plainly
why
i
was
leaving
that
the
monotony
of
matrimony
would
never
do
for
me
do
you
think
i
was
right
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
answered
ives
go
ahead
and
shoot
elephants
if
you
think
it
will
bring
the
element
of
chance
into
your
life
got
to
decide
these
things
for
ourselves
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
forster
i
found
the
way
i
found
out
the
biggest
hazard
in
the
world
a
game
of
chance
that
never
is
concluded
a
venture
that
may
end
in
the
highest
heaven
or
the
blackest
pit
it
will
keep
a
man
on
edge
until
the
clods
fall
on
his
coffin
because
he
will
never
know
not
until
his
last
day
and
not
then
will
he
know
it
is
a
voyage
without
a
rudder
or
compass
and
you
must
be
captain
and
crew
and
keep
watch
every
day
and
night
yourself
with
no
one
to
relieve
you
i
have
found
the
venture
do
bother
yourself
about
leaving
mary
marsden
forster
i
married
her
yesterday
at
noon
xxii
the
duel
the
gods
lying
beside
their
nectar
on
and
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
perceive
a
difference
in
cities
although
it
would
seem
that
to
their
vision
towns
must
appear
as
large
or
small
without
special
characteristics
yet
it
is
not
so
studying
the
habits
of
ants
from
so
great
a
height
should
be
but
a
mild
diversion
when
coupled
with
the
soft
drink
that
mythology
tells
us
is
their
only
solace
but
doubtless
they
have
amused
themselves
by
the
comparison
of
villages
and
towns
and
it
will
be
no
news
to
them
nor
perhaps
to
many
mortals
that
in
one
particularity
new
york
stands
unique
among
the
cities
of
the
world
this
shall
be
the
theme
of
a
little
story
addressed
to
the
man
who
sits
smoking
with
his
feet
on
another
chair
and
to
the
woman
who
snatches
the
paper
for
a
moment
while
boiling
greens
or
a
narcotized
baby
leaves
her
free
with
these
i
love
to
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
new
york
city
is
inhabited
by
mysterious
strangers
thus
beating
bird
centre
by
three
millions
and
half
a
dozen
nine
they
came
here
in
various
ways
and
for
many
reasons
hendrik
hudson
the
art
schools
green
goods
the
stork
the
annual
dressmakers
convention
the
pennsylvania
railroad
love
of
money
the
stage
cheap
excursion
rates
brains
personal
column
heavy
walking
shoes
ambition
freight
trains
all
these
have
had
a
hand
in
making
up
the
population
but
every
man
jack
when
he
first
sets
foot
on
the
stones
of
manhattan
has
got
to
fight
he
has
got
to
fight
at
once
until
either
he
or
his
adversary
wins
there
is
no
resting
between
rounds
for
there
are
no
rounds
it
is
slugging
from
the
first
it
is
a
fight
to
a
finish
your
opponent
is
the
city
you
must
do
battle
with
it
from
the
time
the
lands
you
on
the
island
until
either
it
is
yours
or
it
has
conquered
you
it
is
the
same
whether
you
have
a
million
in
your
pocket
or
only
the
price
of
a
week
lodging
the
battle
is
to
decide
whether
you
shall
become
a
new
yorker
or
turn
the
rankest
outlander
and
philistine
you
must
be
one
or
the
other
you
can
not
remain
neutral
you
must
be
for
or
against
lover
or
enemy
bosom
friend
or
outcast
and
oh
the
city
is
a
general
in
the
ring
not
only
by
blows
does
it
seek
to
subdue
you
it
woos
you
to
its
heart
with
the
subtlety
of
a
siren
it
is
a
combination
of
delilah
green
chartreuse
beethoven
chloral
and
john
in
his
best
days
in
other
cities
you
may
wander
and
abide
as
a
stranger
man
as
long
as
you
please
you
may
live
in
chicago
until
your
hair
whitens
and
be
a
citizen
and
still
prate
of
beans
if
boston
mothered
you
and
without
rebuke
you
may
become
a
civic
pillar
in
any
other
town
but
knickerbocker
and
all
the
time
publicly
sneering
at
its
buildings
comparing
them
with
the
architecture
of
colonel
telfair
residence
in
jackson
whence
you
hail
and
you
will
not
be
set
upon
but
in
new
york
you
must
be
either
a
new
yorker
or
an
invader
of
a
modern
troy
concealed
in
the
wooden
horse
of
your
conceited
provincialism
and
this
dreary
preamble
is
only
to
introduce
to
you
the
unimportant
figures
of
william
and
jack
they
came
out
of
the
west
together
where
they
had
been
friends
they
came
to
dig
their
fortunes
out
of
the
big
city
father
knickerbocker
met
them
at
the
ferry
giving
one
a
on
the
nose
and
the
other
an
with
his
left
just
to
let
them
know
that
the
fight
was
on
william
was
for
business
jack
was
for
art
both
were
young
and
ambitious
so
they
countered
and
clinched
i
think
they
were
from
nebraska
or
possibly
missouri
or
minnesota
anyhow
they
were
out
for
success
and
scraps
and
scads
and
they
tackled
the
city
like
two
lochinvars
with
brass
knucks
and
a
pull
at
the
city
hall
four
years
afterward
william
and
jack
met
at
luncheon
the
business
man
blew
in
like
a
march
wind
hurled
his
silk
hat
at
a
waiter
dropped
into
the
chair
that
was
pushed
under
him
seized
the
bill
of
fare
and
had
ordered
as
far
as
cheese
before
the
artist
had
time
to
do
more
than
nod
after
the
nod
a
humorous
smile
came
into
his
eyes
billy
he
said
you
done
for
the
city
has
gobbled
you
up
it
has
taken
you
and
cut
you
to
its
pattern
and
stamped
you
with
its
brand
you
are
so
nearly
like
ten
thousand
men
i
have
seen
that
you
be
picked
out
from
them
if
it
were
for
your
laundry
marks

william

your
hammer
out
for
new
york

you
well
little
old
is
good
enough
for
me
it
giving
me
mine
and
say
i
used
to
think
the
west
was
the
whole
round
world
only
slightly
flattened
at
the
poles
whenever
bryan
ran
i
used
to
yell
myself
hoarse
about
the
free
expense
and
hang
my
hat
on
the
horizon
and
say
cutting
things
in
the
grocery
to
little
soap
drummers
from
the
east
but
i
never
seen
new
york
then
jack
me
for
it
from
the
rathskellers
up
sixth
avenue
is
the
west
to
me
now
have
you
heard
this
fellow
crusoe
sing
the
desert
isle
for
him
i
say
but
my
wife
made
me
go
give
me
may
irwin
or
willard
any
time
poor
billy
said
the
artist
delicately
fingering
a
cigarette
you
remember
when
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
east
how
we
talked
about
this
great
wonderful
city
and
how
we
meant
to
conquer
it
and
never
let
it
get
the
best
of
us
we
were
going
to
be
just
the
same
fellows
we
had
always
been
and
never
let
it
master
us
it
has
downed
you
old
man
you
have
changed
from
a
maverick
into
a
butterick
do
see
exactly
what
you
are
driving
at
said
william
i
do
wear
an
alpaca
coat
with
blue
trousers
and
a
seersucker
vest
on
dress
occasions
like
i
used
to
do
at
home
you
talk
about
being
cut
to
a
pattern
well
ai
the
pattern
all
right
when
you
in
rome
got
to
do
as
the
dagoes
do
this
town
seems
to
me
to
have
other
alleged
metropolises
skinned
to
flag
stations
according
to
the
railroad
schedule
i
got
in
mind
chicago
and
saint
jo
and
paris
france
are
asterisk
stops
which
means
you
wave
a
red
flag
and
get
on
every
other
tuesday
i
like
this
little
suburb
of
something
or
somebody
doing
all
the
time
i
clearing
a
year
selling
automatic
pumps
and
i
living
like
why
yesterday
i
was
introduced
to
john
gates
i
took
an
auto
ride
with
a
wine
sister
i
saw
two
men
run
over
by
a
street
car
and
i
seen
edna
may
play
in
the
evening
talk
about
the
west
why
the
other
night
i
woke
everybody
up
in
the
hotel
hollering
i
dreamed
i
was
walking
on
a
board
sidewalk
in
oshkosh
what
have
you
got
against
this
town
jack
only
one
thing
in
it
that
i
do
care
for
and
that
a
ferryboat
the
artist
gazed
dreamily
at
the
cartridge
paper
on
the
wall
this
town
said
he
is
a
leech
it
drains
the
blood
of
the
country
whoever
comes
to
it
accepts
a
challenge
to
a
duel
abandoning
the
figure
of
the
leech
it
is
a
juggernaut
a
moloch
a
monster
to
which
the
innocence
the
genius
and
the
beauty
of
the
land
must
pay
tribute
hand
to
hand
every
newcomer
must
struggle
with
the
leviathan
you
lost
billy
it
shall
never
conquer
me
i
hate
it
as
one
hates
sin
or
pestilence
or
the
color
work
in
a
magazine
i
despise
its
very
vastness
and
power
it
has
the
poorest
millionaires
the
littlest
great
men
the
lowest
skyscrapers
the
dolefulest
pleasures
of
any
town
i
ever
saw
it
has
caught
you
old
man
but
i
will
never
run
beside
its
chariot
wheels
it
glosses
itself
as
the
chinaman
glosses
his
collars
give
me
the
domestic
finish
i
could
stand
a
town
ruled
by
wealth
or
one
ruled
by
an
aristocracy
but
this
is
one
controlled
by
its
lowest
ingredients
claiming
culture
it
is
the
crudest
asseverating
its
it
is
the
basest
denying
all
outside
values
and
virtue
it
is
the
narrowest
give
me
the
pure
and
the
open
heart
of
the
west
country
i
would
go
back
there
if
i
could
do
you
like
this
said
william
shucks
now
the
use
to
knock
the
town
it
the
greatest
ever
i
could
sell
one
automatic
pump
between
harrisburg
and
tommy
saloon
in
sacramento
where
i
sell
twenty
here
and
have
you
seen
sara
bernhardt
in
mack
yet
the
town
got
you
billy
said
jack
all
right
said
william
i
going
to
buy
a
cottage
on
lake
ronkonkoma
next
summer
at
midnight
jack
raised
his
window
and
sat
close
to
it
he
caught
his
breath
at
what
he
saw
though
he
had
seen
and
felt
it
a
hundred
times
far
below
and
around
lay
the
city
like
a
ragged
purple
dream
the
irregular
houses
were
like
the
broken
exteriors
of
cliffs
lining
deep
gulches
and
winding
streams
some
were
mountainous
some
lay
in
long
desert
cañons
such
was
the
background
of
the
wonderful
cruel
enchanting
bewildering
fatal
great
city
but
into
this
background
were
cut
myriads
of
brilliant
parallelograms
and
circles
and
squares
through
which
glowed
many
colored
lights
and
out
of
the
violet
and
purple
depths
ascended
like
the
city
soul
sounds
and
odors
and
thrills
that
make
up
the
civic
body
there
arose
the
breath
of
gaiety
unrestrained
of
love
of
hate
of
all
the
passions
that
man
can
know
there
below
him
lay
all
things
good
or
bad
that
can
be
brought
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
to
instruct
please
thrill
enrich
despoil
elevate
cast
down
nurture
or
kill
thus
the
flavor
of
it
came
up
to
him
and
went
into
his
blood
there
was
a
knock
on
his
door
a
telegram
had
come
for
him
it
came
from
the
west
and
these
were
its
words
come
back
and
the
answer
will
be
yes
dolly
he
kept
the
boy
waiting
ten
minutes
and
then
wrote
the
reply
impossible
to
leave
here
at
present
then
he
sat
at
the
window
again
and
let
the
city
put
its
cup
of
mandragora
to
his
lips
again
after
all
it
is
a
story
but
i
wanted
to
know
which
one
of
the
heroes
won
the
battle
against
the
city
so
i
went
to
a
very
learned
friend
and
laid
the
case
before
him
what
he
said
was
please
do
bother
me
i
have
christmas
presents
to
buy
so
there
it
rests
and
you
will
have
to
decide
for
yourself
xxiii
what
you
want
night
had
fallen
on
that
great
and
beautiful
city
known
as
and
with
the
night
came
the
enchanted
glamour
that
belongs
not
to
arabia
alone
in
different
masquerade
the
streets
bazaars
and
walled
houses
of
the
occidental
city
of
romance
were
filled
with
the
same
kind
of
folk
that
so
much
interested
our
interesting
old
friend
the
late
rashid
they
wore
clothes
eleven
hundred
years
nearer
to
the
latest
styles
than
saw
in
old
bagdad
but
they
were
about
the
same
people
underneath
with
the
eye
of
faith
you
could
have
seen
the
little
hunchback
sinbad
the
sailor
fitbad
the
tailor
the
beautiful
persian
the
calenders
ali
baba
and
forty
robbers
on
every
block
and
the
barber
and
his
six
brothers
and
all
the
old
arabian
gang
easily
but
let
us
revenue
to
our
lamb
chops
old
tom
crowley
was
a
caliph
he
had
in
preferred
stocks
and
bonds
with
solid
gold
edges
in
these
times
to
be
called
a
caliph
you
must
have
money
the
caliph
business
as
conducted
by
rashid
is
not
safe
if
you
hold
up
a
person
nowadays
in
a
bazaar
or
a
turkish
bath
or
a
side
street
and
inquire
into
his
private
and
personal
affairs
the
police
court
get
you
old
tom
was
tired
of
clubs
theatres
dinners
friends
music
money
and
everything
that
what
makes
a
caliph
you
must
get
to
despise
everything
that
money
can
buy
and
then
go
out
and
try
to
want
something
that
you
ca
pay
for
i
take
a
little
trot
around
town
all
by
myself
thought
old
tom
and
try
if
i
can
stir
up
anything
new
let
see
it
seems
i
read
about
a
king
or
a
cardiff
giant
or
something
in
old
times
who
used
to
go
about
with
false
whiskers
on
making
persian
dates
with
folks
he
been
introduced
to
that
do
listen
like
a
bad
idea
i
certainly
have
got
a
case
of
humdrumness
and
fatigue
on
for
the
ones
i
do
know
that
old
cardiff
used
to
pick
up
cases
of
trouble
as
he
ran
upon
and
give
gold
sequins
i
think
it
was
and
make
marry
or
got
good
government
jobs
now
i
like
something
of
that
sort
my
money
is
as
good
as
his
was
even
if
the
magazines
do
ask
me
every
month
where
i
got
it
yes
i
guess
i
do
a
little
cardiff
business
and
see
how
it
goes
plainly
dressed
old
tom
crowley
left
his
madison
avenue
palace
and
walked
westward
and
then
south
as
he
stepped
to
the
sidewalk
fate
who
holds
the
ends
of
the
strings
in
the
central
offices
of
all
the
enchanted
cities
pulled
a
thread
and
a
young
man
twenty
blocks
away
looked
at
a
wall
clock
and
then
put
on
his
coat
james
turner
worked
in
one
of
those
little
establishments
on
sixth
avenue
in
which
a
fire
alarm
rings
when
you
push
the
door
open
and
where
they
clean
your
hat
while
you
wait
two
days
james
stood
all
day
at
an
electric
machine
that
turned
hats
around
faster
than
the
best
brands
of
champagne
ever
could
have
done
overlooking
your
mild
impertinence
in
feeling
a
curiosity
about
the
personal
appearance
of
a
stranger
i
will
give
you
a
modified
description
of
him
weight
complexion
hair
and
brain
light
height
five
feet
six
age
about
dressed
in
a
suit
of
serge
pockets
containing
two
keys
and
cents
in
change
but
do
not
misconjecture
because
this
description
sounds
like
a
general
alarm
that
james
was
either
lost
or
a
dead
one
james
stood
all
day
at
his
work
his
feet
were
tender
and
extremely
susceptible
to
impositions
being
put
upon
or
below
them
all
day
long
they
burned
and
smarted
causing
him
much
suffering
and
inconvenience
but
he
was
earning
twelve
dollars
per
week
which
he
needed
to
support
his
feet
whether
his
feet
would
support
him
or
not
james
turner
had
his
own
conception
of
what
happiness
was
just
as
you
and
i
have
ours
your
delight
is
to
gad
about
the
world
in
yachts
and
and
to
hurl
ducats
at
wild
fowl
mine
is
to
smoke
a
pipe
at
evenfall
and
watch
a
badger
a
rattlesnake
and
an
owl
go
into
their
common
prairie
home
one
by
one
james
turner
idea
of
bliss
was
different
but
it
was
his
he
would
go
directly
to
his
when
his
day
work
was
done
after
his
supper
of
small
steak
bessemer
potatoes
stooed
not
stewed
apples
and
infusion
of
chicory
he
would
ascend
to
his
hall
room
then
he
would
take
off
his
shoes
and
socks
place
the
soles
of
his
burning
feet
against
the
cold
bars
of
his
iron
bed
and
read
clark
russell
sea
yarns
the
delicious
relief
of
the
cool
metal
applied
to
his
smarting
soles
was
his
nightly
joy
his
favorite
novels
never
palled
upon
him
the
sea
and
the
adventures
of
its
navigators
were
his
sole
intellectual
passion
no
millionaire
was
ever
happier
than
james
turner
taking
his
ease
when
james
left
the
shop
he
walked
three
blocks
out
of
his
way
home
to
look
over
the
goods
of
a
bookstall
on
the
sidewalk
stands
he
had
more
than
once
picked
up
a
volume
of
clark
russell
at
half
price
while
he
was
bending
with
a
scholarly
stoop
over
the
miscellany
of
literature
old
tom
the
caliph
sauntered
by
his
discerning
eye
made
keen
by
twenty
years
experience
in
the
manufacture
of
laundry
soap
save
the
wrappers
recognized
instantly
the
poor
and
discerning
scholar
a
worthy
object
of
his
caliphanous
mood
he
descended
the
two
shallow
stone
steps
that
led
from
the
sidewalk
and
addressed
without
hesitation
the
object
of
his
designed
munificence
his
first
words
were
no
worse
than
salutatory
and
tentative
james
turner
looked
up
coldly
with
sartor
resartus
in
one
hand
and
a
mad
marriage
in
the
other
beat
it
said
he
i
do
want
to
buy
any
coat
hangers
or
town
lots
in
hankipoo
new
jersey
run
along
now
and
play
with
your
teddy
bear
young
man
said
the
caliph
ignoring
the
flippancy
of
the
hat
cleaner
i
observe
that
you
are
of
a
studious
disposition
learning
is
one
of
the
finest
things
in
the
world
i
never
had
any
of
it
worth
mentioning
but
i
admire
to
see
it
in
others
i
come
from
the
west
where
we
imagine
nothing
but
facts
maybe
i
could
understand
the
poetry
and
allusions
in
them
books
you
are
picking
over
but
i
like
to
see
somebody
else
seem
to
know
what
they
mean
i
worth
about
and
i
getting
richer
every
day
i
made
the
height
of
it
manufacturing
aunt
silver
soap
i
invented
the
art
of
making
it
i
experimented
for
three
years
before
i
got
just
the
right
quantity
of
chloride
of
sodium
solution
and
caustic
potash
mixture
to
curdle
properly
and
after
i
had
taken
some
out
of
the
soap
business
i
made
the
rest
in
corn
and
wheat
futures
now
you
seem
to
have
the
literary
and
scholarly
turn
of
character
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
pay
for
your
education
at
the
finest
college
in
the
world
i
pay
the
expense
of
your
rummaging
over
europe
and
the
art
galleries
and
finally
set
you
up
in
a
good
business
you
need
make
it
soap
if
you
have
any
objections
i
see
by
your
clothes
and
frazzled
necktie
that
you
are
mighty
poor
and
you
ca
afford
to
turn
down
the
offer
well
when
do
you
want
to
begin
the
hat
cleaner
turned
upon
old
tom
the
eye
of
the
big
city
which
is
an
eye
expressive
of
cold
and
justifiable
suspicion
of
judgment
suspended
as
high
as
haman
was
hung
of
of
challenge
curiosity
defiance
cynicism
and
strange
as
you
may
think
it
of
a
childlike
yearning
for
friendliness
and
fellowship
that
must
be
hidden
when
one
walks
among
the
stranger
bands
for
in
new
bagdad
one
in
order
to
survive
must
suspect
whosoever
sits
dwells
drinks
rides
walks
or
sleeps
in
the
adjacent
chair
house
booth
seat
path
or
room
say
mike
said
james
turner
what
your
line
anyway
shoe
laces
i
not
buying
anything
you
better
put
an
egg
in
your
shoe
and
beat
it
before
incidents
occur
to
you
you
ca
work
off
any
fountain
pens
gold
spectacles

found
on
the
street
or
trust

i
look
like
i
climbed
down
one
of
them
missing
at
helicon
hall
what
vitiating
you
anyhow
son
said
the
caliph
in
his
most
harunish
tones
as
i
said
worth
i
do
want
to
have
it
all
put
in
my
coffin
when
i
die
i
want
to
do
some
good
with
it
i
seen
you
handling
over
these
here
volumes
of
literature
and
i
thought
i
keep
you
i
give
the
missionary
societies
but
what
did
i
get
out
of
it
nothing
but
a
receipt
from
the
secretary
now
you
are
just
the
kind
of
young
man
i
like
to
take
up
and
see
what
money
could
make
of
him
volumes
of
clark
russell
were
hard
to
find
that
evening
at
the
old
book
shop
and
james
turner
smarting
and
aching
feet
did
not
tend
to
improve
his
temper
humble
hat
cleaner
though
he
was
he
had
a
spirit
equal
to
any
caliph
say
you
old
faker
he
said
angrily
be
on
your
way
i
do
know
what
your
game
is
unless
you
want
change
for
a
bogus
bill
well
i
do
carry
that
much
around
with
me
but
i
do
carry
a
pretty
fair
punch
that
you
get
if
you
do
move
on
you
are
a
blamed
impudent
little
gutter
pup
said
the
caliph
then
james
delivered
his
punch
old

and
clinched
two
bookstands

in

james

laid
himself
on
his
cot
ruminating
maybe
he
got
the

ai
but
if

face
he
removed
his
socks
drew
his
cot
close
to
the

stretched
himself
out
luxuriously
and
placed
his
tortured
feet
against
the
cold
bars
of
the
cell
door
something
hard
and
bulky
under
the
blankets
of
his
cot
gave
one
shoulder
discomfort
he
reached
under
and
drew
out
a
volume

russell
called
a
sailor

he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
contentment

of
