the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
by
gaston
leroux
chapter
i
in
which
we
begin
not
to
understand
it
is
not
without
a
certain
emotion
that
i
begin
to
recount
here
the
extraordinary
adventures
of
joseph
rouletabille
down
to
the
present
time
he
had
so
firmly
opposed
my
doing
it
that
i
had
come
to
despair
of
ever
publishing
the
most
curious
of
police
stories
of
the
past
fifteen
years
i
had
even
imagined
that
the
public
would
never
know
the
whole
truth
of
the
prodigious
case
known
as
that
of
the
yellow
room
out
of
which
grew
so
many
mysterious
cruel
and
sensational
dramas
with
which
my
friend
was
so
closely
mixed
up
if
propos
of
a
recent
nomination
of
the
illustrious
stangerson
to
the
grade
of
grandcross
of
the
legion
of
honour
an
evening
journal
in
an
article
miserable
for
its
ignorance
or
audacious
for
its
perfidy
had
not
resuscitated
a
terrible
adventure
of
which
joseph
rouletabille
had
told
me
he
wished
to
be
for
ever
forgotten
the
yellow
room
who
now
remembers
this
affair
which
caused
so
much
ink
to
flow
fifteen
years
ago
events
are
so
quickly
forgotten
in
paris
has
not
the
very
name
of
the
nayves
trial
and
the
tragic
history
of
the
death
of
little
menaldo
passed
out
of
mind
and
yet
the
public
attention
was
so
deeply
interested
in
the
details
of
the
trial
that
the
occurrence
of
a
ministerial
crisis
was
completely
unnoticed
at
the
time
now
the
yellow
room
trial
which
preceded
that
of
the
nayves
by
some
years
made
far
more
noise
the
entire
world
hung
for
months
over
this
obscure
problem
the
most
obscure
it
seems
to
me
that
has
ever
challenged
the
perspicacity
of
our
police
or
taxed
the
conscience
of
our
judges
the
solution
of
the
problem
baffled
everybody
who
tried
to
find
it
it
was
like
a
dramatic
rebus
with
which
old
europe
and
new
america
alike
became
fascinated
that
is
in
truth
i
am
permitted
to
say
because
there
can
not
be
any
author
s
vanity
in
all
this
since
i
do
nothing
more
than
transcribe
facts
on
which
an
exceptional
documentation
enables
me
to
throw
a
new
light
that
is
because
in
truth
i
do
not
know
that
in
the
domain
of
reality
or
imagination
one
can
discover
or
recall
to
mind
anything
comparable
in
its
mystery
with
the
natural
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
that
which
nobody
could
find
out
joseph
rouletabille
aged
eighteen
then
a
reporter
engaged
on
a
leading
journal
succeeded
in
discovering
but
when
at
the
assize
court
he
brought
in
the
key
to
the
whole
case
he
did
not
tell
the
whole
truth
he
only
allowed
so
much
of
it
to
appear
as
sufficed
to
ensure
the
acquittal
of
an
innocent
man
the
reasons
which
he
had
for
his
reticence
no
longer
exist
better
still
the
time
has
come
for
my
friend
to
speak
out
fully
you
are
going
to
know
all
and
without
further
preamble
i
am
going
to
place
before
your
eyes
the
problem
of
the
yellow
room
as
it
was
placed
before
the
eyes
of
the
entire
world
on
the
day
following
the
enactment
of
the
drama
at
the
chateau
du
glandier
on
the
of
october
the
following
note
appeared
in
the
latest
edition
of
the
temps
a
frightful
crime
has
been
committed
at
the
glandier
on
the
border
of
the
forest
of
above
at
the
house
of
professor
stangerson
on
that
night
while
the
master
was
working
in
his
laboratory
an
attempt
was
made
to
assassinate
mademoiselle
stangerson
who
was
sleeping
in
a
chamber
adjoining
this
laboratory
the
doctors
do
not
answer
for
the
life
of
mdlle
the
impression
made
on
paris
by
this
news
may
be
easily
imagined
already
at
that
time
the
learned
world
was
deeply
interested
in
the
labours
of
professor
stangerson
and
his
daughter
these
labours
the
first
that
were
attempted
in
radiography
served
to
open
the
way
for
monsieur
and
madame
curie
to
the
discovery
of
radium
it
was
expected
the
professor
would
shortly
read
to
the
academy
of
sciences
a
sensational
paper
on
his
new
theory
the
dissociation
of
matter
a
theory
destined
to
overthrow
from
its
base
the
whole
of
official
science
which
based
itself
on
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
on
the
following
day
the
newspapers
were
full
of
the
tragedy
the
matin
among
others
published
the
following
article
entitled
a
supernatural
crime
these
are
the
only
details
wrote
the
anonymous
writer
in
the
matin
we
have
been
able
to
obtain
concerning
the
crime
of
the
chateau
du
glandier
the
state
of
despair
in
which
professor
stangerson
is
plunged
and
the
impossibility
of
getting
any
information
from
the
lips
of
the
victim
have
rendered
our
investigations
and
those
of
justice
so
difficult
that
at
present
we
can
not
form
the
least
idea
of
what
has
passed
in
the
yellow
room
in
which
mdlle
stangerson
in
her
was
found
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
agonies
of
death
we
have
at
least
been
able
to
interview
daddy
jacques
as
he
is
called
in
the
country
a
old
servant
in
the
stangerson
family
daddy
jacques
entered
the
yellow
room
at
the
same
time
as
the
professor
this
chamber
adjoins
the
laboratory
laboratory
and
yellow
room
are
in
a
pavilion
at
the
end
of
the
park
about
three
hundred
metres
a
thousand
feet
from
the
chateau
it
was
twelve
at
night
this
honest
old
man
told
us
and
i
was
in
the
laboratory
where
monsieur
stangerson
was
still
working
when
the
thing
happened
i
had
been
cleaning
and
putting
instruments
in
order
all
the
evening
and
was
waiting
for
monsieur
stangerson
to
go
to
bed
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
worked
with
her
father
up
to
midnight
when
the
twelve
strokes
of
midnight
had
sounded
by
the
in
the
laboratory
she
rose
kissed
monsieur
stangerson
and
bade
him
to
me
she
said
bon
soir
daddy
jacques
as
she
passed
into
the
yellow
room
we
heard
her
lock
the
door
and
shoot
the
bolt
so
that
i
could
not
help
laughing
and
said
to
monsieur
there
s
mademoiselle
herself
in
she
must
be
afraid
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
monsieur
did
not
even
hear
me
he
was
so
deeply
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
just
then
we
heard
the
distant
miawing
of
a
cat
is
that
going
to
keep
us
awake
all
night
i
said
to
myself
for
i
must
tell
you
monsieur
that
to
the
end
of
october
i
live
in
an
attic
of
the
pavilion
over
the
yellow
room
so
that
mademoiselle
should
not
be
left
alone
through
the
night
in
the
lonely
park
it
was
the
fancy
of
mademoiselle
to
spend
the
fine
weather
in
the
pavilion
no
doubt
she
found
it
more
cheerful
than
the
chateau
and
for
the
four
years
it
had
been
built
she
had
never
failed
to
take
up
her
lodging
there
in
the
spring
with
the
return
of
winter
mademoiselle
returns
to
the
chateau
for
there
is
no
fireplace
in
the
yellow
room
we
were
staying
in
the
pavilion
then
monsieur
stangerson
and
me
we
made
no
noise
he
was
seated
at
his
desk
as
for
me
i
was
sitting
on
a
chair
having
finished
my
work
and
looking
at
him
i
said
to
myself
what
a
man
what
intelligence
what
knowledge
i
attach
importance
to
the
fact
that
we
made
no
noise
for
because
of
that
the
assassin
certainly
thought
that
we
had
left
the
place
and
suddenly
while
the
cuckoo
was
sounding
the
half
after
midnight
a
desperate
clamour
broke
out
in
the
yellow
room
it
was
the
voice
of
mademoiselle
crying
murder
murder
help
immediately
afterwards
revolver
shots
rang
out
and
there
was
a
great
noise
of
tables
and
furniture
being
thrown
to
the
ground
as
if
in
the
course
of
a
struggle
and
again
the
voice
of
mademoiselle
calling
murder
help
papa
papa
you
may
be
sure
that
we
quickly
sprang
up
and
that
monsieur
stangerson
and
i
threw
ourselves
upon
the
door
but
alas
it
was
locked
fast
locked
on
the
inside
by
the
care
of
mademoiselle
as
i
have
told
you
with
key
and
bolt
we
tried
to
force
it
open
but
it
remained
firm
monsieur
stangerson
was
like
a
madman
and
truly
it
was
enough
to
make
him
one
for
we
heard
mademoiselle
still
calling
help
help
monsieur
stangerson
showered
terrible
blows
on
the
door
and
wept
with
rage
and
sobbed
with
despair
and
helplessness
it
was
then
that
i
had
an
inspiration
the
assassin
must
have
entered
by
the
window
i
cried
i
will
go
to
the
window
and
i
rushed
from
the
pavilion
and
ran
like
one
out
of
his
mind
the
inspiration
was
that
the
window
of
the
yellow
room
looks
out
in
such
a
way
that
the
park
wall
which
abuts
on
the
pavilion
prevented
my
at
once
reaching
the
window
to
get
up
to
it
one
has
first
to
go
out
of
the
park
i
ran
towards
the
gate
and
on
my
way
met
bernier
and
his
wife
the
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
pistol
reports
and
by
our
cries
in
a
few
words
i
told
them
what
had
happened
and
directed
the
concierge
to
join
monsieur
stangerson
with
all
speed
while
his
wife
came
with
me
to
open
the
park
gate
five
minutes
later
she
and
i
were
before
the
window
of
the
yellow
room
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
and
i
saw
clearly
that
no
one
had
touched
the
window
not
only
were
the
bars
that
protect
it
intact
but
the
blinds
inside
of
them
were
drawn
as
i
had
myself
drawn
them
early
in
the
evening
as
i
did
every
day
though
mademoiselle
knowing
that
i
was
tired
from
the
heavy
work
i
had
been
doing
had
begged
me
not
to
trouble
myself
but
leave
her
to
do
it
and
they
were
just
as
i
had
left
them
fastened
with
an
iron
catch
on
the
inside
the
assassin
therefore
could
not
have
passed
either
in
or
out
that
way
but
neither
could
i
get
in
it
was
unfortunate
enough
to
turn
one
s
brain
the
door
of
the
room
locked
on
the
inside
and
the
blinds
on
the
only
window
also
fastened
on
the
inside
and
mademoiselle
still
calling
for
help
no
she
had
ceased
to
call
she
was
dead
perhaps
but
i
still
heard
her
father
in
the
pavilion
trying
to
break
down
the
door
with
the
concierge
i
hurried
back
to
the
pavilion
the
door
in
spite
of
the
furious
attempts
of
monsieur
stangerson
and
bernier
to
burst
it
open
was
still
holding
firm
but
at
length
it
gave
way
before
our
united
efforts
and
then
what
a
sight
met
our
eyes
i
should
tell
you
that
behind
us
the
concierge
held
the
laboratory
lamp
a
powerful
lamp
that
lit
the
whole
chamber
i
must
also
tell
you
monsieur
that
the
yellow
room
is
a
very
small
room
mademoiselle
had
furnished
it
with
a
fairly
large
iron
bedstead
a
small
table
a
a
and
two
chairs
by
the
light
of
the
big
lamp
we
saw
all
at
a
glance
mademoiselle
in
her
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
disorder
tables
and
chairs
had
been
overthrown
showing
that
there
had
been
a
violent
struggle
mademoiselle
had
certainly
been
dragged
from
her
bed
she
was
covered
with
blood
and
had
terrible
marks
of
on
her
throat
the
flesh
of
her
neck
having
been
almost
torn
by
the
nails
from
a
wound
on
the
right
temple
a
stream
of
blood
had
run
down
and
made
a
little
pool
on
the
floor
when
monsieur
stangerson
saw
his
daughter
in
that
state
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
uttering
a
cry
of
despair
he
ascertained
that
she
still
breathed
as
to
us
we
searched
for
the
wretch
who
had
tried
to
kill
our
mistress
and
i
swear
to
you
monsieur
that
if
we
had
found
him
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
but
how
to
explain
that
he
was
not
there
that
he
had
already
escaped
it
passes
all
imagination
nobody
under
the
bed
nobody
behind
the
furniture
all
that
we
discovered
were
traces
marks
of
a
man
s
large
hand
on
the
walls
and
on
the
door
a
big
handkerchief
red
with
blood
without
any
initials
an
old
cap
and
many
fresh
footmarks
of
a
man
on
the
floor
footmarks
of
a
man
with
large
feet
whose
had
left
a
sort
of
sooty
impression
how
had
this
man
got
away
how
had
he
vanished
don
t
forget
monsieur
that
there
is
no
chimney
in
the
yellow
room
he
could
not
have
escaped
by
the
door
which
is
narrow
and
on
the
threshold
of
which
the
concierge
stood
with
the
lamp
while
her
husband
and
i
searched
for
him
in
every
corner
of
the
little
room
where
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
hide
himself
the
door
which
had
been
forced
open
against
the
wall
could
not
conceal
anything
behind
it
as
we
assured
ourselves
by
the
window
still
in
every
way
secured
no
flight
had
been
possible
what
then
i
began
to
believe
in
the
devil
but
we
discovered
my
revolver
on
the
floor
yes
my
revolver
oh
that
brought
me
back
to
the
reality
the
devil
would
not
have
needed
to
steal
my
revolver
to
kill
mademoiselle
the
man
who
had
been
there
had
first
gone
up
to
my
attic
and
taken
my
revolver
from
the
drawer
where
i
kept
it
we
then
ascertained
by
counting
the
cartridges
that
the
assassin
had
fired
two
shots
ah
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
monsieur
stangerson
was
in
the
laboratory
when
the
affair
took
place
and
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
that
i
was
there
with
him
for
otherwise
with
this
business
of
my
revolver
i
don
t
know
where
we
should
have
been
i
should
now
be
under
lock
and
bar
justice
wants
no
more
to
send
a
man
to
the
scaffold
the
editor
of
the
matin
added
to
this
interview
the
following
lines
we
have
without
interrupting
him
allowed
daddy
jacques
to
recount
to
us
roughly
all
he
knows
about
the
crime
of
the
yellow
room
we
have
reproduced
it
in
his
own
words
only
sparing
the
reader
the
continual
lamentations
with
which
he
garnished
his
narrative
it
is
quite
understood
daddy
jacques
quite
understood
that
you
are
very
fond
of
your
masters
and
you
want
them
to
know
it
and
never
cease
repeating
it
especially
since
the
discovery
of
your
revolver
it
is
your
right
and
we
see
no
harm
in
it
we
should
have
liked
to
put
some
further
questions
to
daddy
jacques
jacques
louis
moustier
but
the
inquiry
of
the
examining
magistrate
which
is
being
carried
on
at
the
chateau
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
gain
admission
at
the
glandier
and
as
to
the
oak
wood
it
is
guarded
by
a
wide
circle
of
policemen
who
are
jealously
watching
all
traces
that
can
lead
to
the
pavilion
and
that
may
perhaps
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
we
have
also
wished
to
question
the
concierges
but
they
are
invisible
finally
we
have
waited
in
a
roadside
inn
not
far
from
the
gate
of
the
chateau
for
the
departure
of
monsieur
de
marquet
the
magistrate
of
corbeil
at
five
we
saw
him
and
his
clerk
and
before
he
was
able
to
enter
his
carriage
had
an
opportunity
to
ask
him
the
following
question
can
you
monsieur
de
marquet
give
us
any
information
as
to
this
affair
without
inconvenience
to
the
course
of
your
inquiry
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
do
it
replied
monsieur
de
marquet
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
the
strangest
affair
i
have
ever
known
the
more
we
think
we
know
something
the
further
we
are
from
knowing
anything
we
asked
monsieur
de
marquet
to
be
good
enough
to
explain
his
last
words
and
this
is
what
he
said
the
importance
of
which
no
one
will
fail
to
recognise
if
nothing
is
added
to
the
material
facts
so
far
established
i
fear
that
the
mystery
which
surrounds
the
abominable
crime
of
which
mademoiselle
stangerson
has
been
the
victim
will
never
be
brought
to
light
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
the
sake
of
our
human
reason
that
the
examination
of
the
walls
and
of
the
ceiling
of
the
yellow
room
an
examination
which
i
shall
intrust
to
the
builder
who
constructed
the
pavilion
four
years
ago
will
afford
us
the
proof
that
may
not
discourage
us
for
the
problem
is
this
we
know
by
what
way
the
assassin
gained
admission
he
entered
by
the
door
and
hid
himself
under
the
bed
awaiting
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
how
did
he
leave
how
did
he
escape
if
no
trap
no
secret
door
no
hiding
place
no
opening
of
any
sort
is
found
if
the
examination
of
the
walls
even
to
the
demolition
of
the
pavilion
does
not
reveal
any
passage
practicable
not
only
for
a
human
being
but
for
any
being
whatsoever
if
the
ceiling
shows
no
crack
if
the
floor
hides
no
underground
passage
one
must
really
believe
in
the
devil
as
daddy
jacques
says
and
the
anonymous
writer
in
the
matin
added
in
this
article
which
i
have
selected
as
the
most
interesting
of
all
those
that
were
published
on
the
subject
of
this
affair
that
the
examining
magistrate
appeared
to
place
a
peculiar
significance
to
the
last
sentence
one
must
really
believe
in
the
devil
as
jacques
the
article
concluded
with
these
lines
we
wanted
to
know
what
daddy
jacques
meant
by
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
the
landlord
of
the
donjon
inn
explained
to
us
that
it
is
the
particularly
sinister
cry
which
is
uttered
sometimes
at
night
by
the
cat
of
an
old
woman
mother
angenoux
as
she
is
called
in
the
country
mother
angenoux
is
a
sort
of
saint
who
lives
in
a
hut
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
not
far
from
the
grotto
of
the
yellow
room
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
mother
angenoux
the
devil
daddy
jacques
here
is
a
well
entangled
crime
which
the
stroke
of
a
pickaxe
in
the
wall
may
disentangle
for
us
let
us
at
least
hope
that
for
the
sake
of
our
human
reason
as
the
examining
magistrate
says
meanwhile
it
is
expected
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
who
has
not
ceased
to
be
delirious
and
only
pronounces
one
word
distinctly
murderer
murderer
will
not
live
through
the
in
conclusion
and
at
a
late
hour
the
same
journal
announced
that
the
chief
of
the
surete
had
telegraphed
to
the
famous
detective
frederic
larsan
who
had
been
sent
to
london
for
an
affair
of
stolen
securities
to
return
immediately
to
paris
chapter
ii
in
which
joseph
rouletabille
appears
for
the
first
time
i
remember
as
well
as
if
it
had
occurred
yesterday
the
entry
of
young
rouletabille
into
my
bedroom
that
morning
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
and
i
was
still
in
bed
reading
the
article
in
the
matin
relative
to
the
glandier
crime
but
before
going
further
it
is
time
that
i
present
my
friend
to
the
reader
i
first
knew
joseph
rouletabille
when
he
was
a
young
reporter
at
that
time
i
was
a
beginner
at
the
bar
and
often
met
him
in
the
corridors
of
examining
magistrates
when
i
had
gone
to
get
a
permit
to
communicate
for
the
prison
of
mazas
or
for
he
had
as
they
say
a
good
he
seemed
to
have
taken
his
head
round
as
a
bullet
out
of
a
box
of
marbles
and
it
is
from
that
i
think
that
his
comrades
of
the
press
all
determined
had
given
him
that
nickname
which
was
to
stick
to
him
and
be
made
illustrious
by
him
he
was
always
as
red
as
a
tomato
now
gay
as
a
lark
now
grave
as
a
judge
how
while
still
so
young
he
was
only
sixteen
and
a
half
years
old
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
had
he
already
won
his
way
on
the
press
that
was
what
everybody
who
came
into
contact
with
him
might
have
asked
if
they
had
not
known
his
history
at
the
time
of
the
affair
of
the
woman
cut
in
pieces
in
the
rue
oberskampf
another
forgotten
story
he
had
taken
to
one
of
the
editors
of
the
epoque
a
paper
then
rivalling
the
matin
for
information
the
left
foot
which
was
missing
from
the
basket
in
which
the
gruesome
remains
were
discovered
for
this
left
foot
the
police
had
been
vainly
searching
for
a
week
and
young
rouletabille
had
found
it
in
a
drain
where
nobody
had
thought
of
looking
for
it
to
do
that
he
had
dressed
himself
as
an
extra
one
of
a
number
engaged
by
the
administration
of
the
city
of
paris
owing
to
an
overflow
of
the
seine
when
the
was
in
possession
of
the
precious
foot
and
informed
as
to
the
train
of
intelligent
deductions
the
boy
had
been
led
to
make
he
was
divided
between
the
admiration
he
felt
for
such
detective
cunning
in
a
brain
of
a
lad
of
sixteen
years
and
delight
at
being
able
to
exhibit
in
the
morgue
window
of
his
paper
the
left
foot
of
the
rue
oberskampf
this
foot
he
cried
will
make
a
great
then
when
he
had
confided
the
gruesome
packet
to
the
medical
lawyer
attached
to
the
journal
he
asked
the
lad
who
was
shortly
to
become
famous
as
rouletabille
what
he
would
expect
to
earn
as
a
general
reporter
on
the
epoque
two
hundred
francs
a
month
the
youngster
replied
modestly
hardly
able
to
breathe
from
surprise
at
the
proposal
you
shall
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
said
the
only
you
must
tell
everybody
that
you
have
been
engaged
on
the
paper
for
a
month
let
it
be
quite
understood
that
it
was
not
you
but
the
epoque
that
discovered
the
left
foot
of
the
rue
oberskampf
here
my
young
friend
the
man
is
nothing
the
paper
having
said
this
he
begged
the
new
reporter
to
retire
but
before
the
youth
had
reached
the
door
he
called
him
back
to
ask
his
name
the
other
replied
joseph
that
s
not
a
name
said
the
but
since
you
will
not
be
required
to
sign
what
you
write
it
is
of
no
the
reporter
speedily
made
himself
many
friends
for
he
was
serviceable
and
gifted
with
a
good
humour
that
enchanted
the
most
and
disarmed
the
most
zealous
of
his
companions
at
the
bar
cafe
where
the
reporters
assembled
before
going
to
any
of
the
courts
or
to
the
prefecture
in
search
of
their
news
of
crime
he
began
to
win
a
reputation
as
an
unraveller
of
intricate
and
obscure
affairs
which
found
its
way
to
the
office
of
the
chief
of
the
surete
when
a
case
was
worth
the
trouble
and
rouletabille
he
had
already
been
given
his
nickname
had
been
started
on
the
scent
by
his
he
often
got
the
better
of
the
most
famous
detective
it
was
at
the
bar
cafe
that
i
became
intimately
acquainted
with
him
criminal
lawyers
and
journalists
are
not
enemies
the
former
need
advertisement
the
latter
information
we
chatted
together
and
i
soon
warmed
towards
him
his
intelligence
was
so
keen
and
so
original
and
he
had
a
quality
of
thought
such
as
i
have
never
found
in
any
other
person
some
time
after
this
i
was
put
in
charge
of
the
law
news
of
the
cri
du
my
entry
into
journalism
could
not
but
strengthen
the
ties
which
united
me
to
rouletabille
after
a
while
my
new
friend
being
allowed
to
carry
out
an
idea
of
a
judicial
correspondence
column
which
he
was
allowed
to
sign
business
in
the
epoque
i
was
often
able
to
furnish
him
with
the
legal
information
of
which
he
stood
in
need
nearly
two
years
passed
in
this
way
and
the
better
i
knew
him
the
more
i
learned
to
love
him
for
in
spite
of
his
careless
extravagance
i
had
discovered
in
him
what
was
considering
his
age
an
extraordinary
seriousness
of
mind
accustomed
as
i
was
to
seeing
him
gay
and
indeed
often
too
gay
i
would
many
times
find
him
plunged
in
the
deepest
melancholy
i
tried
then
to
question
him
as
to
the
cause
of
this
change
of
humour
but
each
time
he
laughed
and
made
me
no
answer
one
day
having
questioned
him
about
his
parents
of
whom
he
never
spoke
he
left
me
pretending
not
to
have
heard
what
i
said
while
things
were
in
this
state
between
us
the
famous
case
of
the
yellow
room
took
place
it
was
this
case
which
was
to
rank
him
as
the
leading
newspaper
reporter
and
to
obtain
for
him
the
reputation
of
being
the
greatest
detective
in
the
world
it
should
not
surprise
us
to
find
in
the
one
man
the
perfection
of
two
such
lines
of
activity
if
we
remember
that
the
daily
press
was
already
beginning
to
transform
itself
and
to
become
what
it
is
the
gazette
of
crime
people
may
complain
of
this
for
myself
i
regard
it
a
matter
for
congratulation
we
can
never
have
too
many
arms
public
or
private
against
the
criminal
to
this
some
people
may
answer
that
by
continually
publishing
the
details
of
crimes
the
press
ends
by
encouraging
their
commission
but
then
with
some
people
we
can
never
do
right
rouletabille
as
i
have
said
entered
my
room
that
morning
of
the
of
october
he
was
looking
redder
than
usual
and
his
eyes
were
bulging
out
of
his
head
as
the
phrase
is
and
altogether
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
extreme
excitement
he
waved
the
matin
with
a
trembling
hand
and
cried
well
my
dear
sainclair
have
you
read
it
the
glandier
crime
yes
the
yellow
room
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
that
it
must
have
been
the
devil
or
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
that
committed
the
be
serious
well
i
don
t
much
believe
in
who
make
their
escape
through
walls
of
solid
brick
i
think
daddy
jacques
did
wrong
to
leave
behind
him
the
weapon
with
which
the
crime
was
committed
and
as
he
occupied
the
attic
immediately
above
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
the
builder
s
job
ordered
by
the
examining
magistrate
will
give
us
the
key
of
the
enigma
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
learn
by
what
natural
trap
or
by
what
secret
door
the
old
fellow
was
able
to
slip
in
and
out
and
return
immediately
to
the
laboratory
to
monsieur
stangerson
without
his
absence
being
noticed
that
of
course
is
only
an
the
original
english
translation
often
uses
the
words
murder
and
murderer
the
reader
may
substitute
attack
and
attacker
since
no
murder
is
actually
committed
rouletabille
sat
down
in
an
armchair
lit
his
pipe
which
he
was
never
without
smoked
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
no
doubt
to
calm
the
excitement
which
visibly
dominated
him
and
then
replied
young
man
he
said
in
a
tone
the
sad
irony
of
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
render
young
man
you
are
a
lawyer
and
i
doubt
not
your
ability
to
save
the
guilty
from
conviction
but
if
you
were
a
magistrate
on
the
bench
how
easy
it
would
be
for
you
to
condemn
innocent
persons
you
are
really
gifted
young
man
he
continued
to
smoke
energetically
and
then
went
on
no
trap
will
be
found
and
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
will
become
more
and
more
mysterious
that
s
why
it
interests
me
the
examining
magistrate
is
right
nothing
stranger
than
this
crime
has
ever
been
have
you
any
idea
of
the
way
by
which
the
murderer
escaped
i
asked
none
replied
rouletabille
none
for
the
present
but
i
have
an
idea
as
to
the
revolver
the
murderer
did
not
use
good
heavens
by
whom
then
was
it
used
why
by
mademoiselle
i
don
t
understand
or
rather
i
have
never
understood
i
said
rouletabille
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
there
nothing
in
this
article
in
the
matin
by
which
you
were
particularly
struck
nothing
i
have
found
the
whole
of
the
story
it
tells
equally
well
but
the
locked
door
with
the
key
on
the
inside
that
s
the
only
perfectly
natural
thing
in
the
whole
really
and
the
bolt
the
bolt
yes
the
bolt
also
inside
the
room
a
still
further
protection
against
entry
mademoiselle
stangerson
took
quite
extraordinary
precautions
it
is
clear
to
me
that
she
feared
someone
that
was
why
she
took
such
precautions
even
daddy
jacques
s
revolver
without
telling
him
of
it
no
doubt
she
didn
t
wish
to
alarm
anybody
and
least
of
all
her
father
what
she
dreaded
took
place
and
she
defended
herself
there
was
a
struggle
and
she
used
the
revolver
skilfully
enough
to
wound
the
assassin
in
the
hand
which
explains
the
impression
on
the
wall
and
on
the
door
of
the
large
hand
of
the
man
who
was
searching
for
a
means
of
exit
from
the
chamber
but
she
didn
t
fire
soon
enough
to
avoid
the
terrible
blow
on
the
right
then
the
wound
on
the
temple
was
not
done
with
the
revolver
the
paper
doesn
t
say
it
was
and
i
don
t
think
it
was
because
logically
it
appears
to
me
that
the
revolver
was
used
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
against
the
assassin
now
what
weapon
did
the
murderer
use
the
blow
on
the
temple
seems
to
show
that
the
murderer
wished
to
stun
mademoiselle
stangerson
after
he
had
unsuccessfully
tried
to
strangle
her
he
must
have
known
that
the
attic
was
inhabited
by
daddy
jacques
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
why
he
must
have
used
a
quiet
weapon
a
or
a
all
that
doesn
t
explain
how
the
murderer
got
out
of
the
yellow
room
i
observed
evidently
replied
rouletabille
rising
and
that
is
what
has
to
be
explained
i
am
going
to
the
chateau
du
glandier
and
have
come
to
see
whether
you
will
go
with
i
yes
my
boy
i
want
you
the
epoque
has
definitely
entrusted
this
case
to
me
and
i
must
clear
it
up
as
quickly
as
but
in
what
way
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
monsieur
robert
darzac
is
at
the
chateau
du
that
s
true
his
despair
must
be
i
must
have
a
talk
with
rouletabille
said
it
in
a
tone
that
surprised
me
is
it
because
you
think
there
is
something
to
be
got
out
of
him
i
asked
that
was
all
he
would
say
he
retired
to
my
begging
me
to
dress
quickly
i
knew
monsieur
robert
darzac
from
having
been
of
great
service
to
him
in
a
civil
action
while
i
was
acting
as
secretary
to
maitre
barbet
delatour
monsieur
robert
darzac
who
was
at
that
time
about
forty
years
of
age
was
a
professor
of
physics
at
the
sorbonne
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
stangersons
and
after
an
assiduous
seven
years
courtship
of
the
daughter
had
been
on
the
point
of
marrying
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
has
become
as
the
phrase
goes
a
person
of
a
certain
age
she
was
still
remarkably
while
i
was
dressing
i
called
out
to
rouletabille
who
was
impatiently
moving
about
my
have
you
any
idea
as
to
the
murderer
s
station
in
life
yes
he
replied
i
think
if
he
isn
t
a
man
in
society
he
is
at
least
a
man
belonging
to
the
upper
class
but
that
again
is
only
an
what
has
led
you
to
form
it
well
the
greasy
cap
the
common
handkerchief
and
the
marks
of
the
rough
boots
on
the
floor
he
replied
i
understand
i
said
murderers
don
t
leave
traces
behind
them
which
tell
the
we
shall
make
something
out
of
you
yet
my
dear
sainclair
concluded
rouletabille
chapter
iii
a
man
has
passed
like
a
shadow
through
the
blinds
half
an
hour
later
rouletabille
and
i
were
on
the
platform
of
the
orleans
station
awaiting
the
departure
of
the
train
which
was
to
take
us
to
on
the
platform
we
found
monsieur
de
marquet
and
his
registrar
who
represented
the
judicial
court
of
corbeil
monsieur
marquet
had
spent
the
night
in
paris
attending
the
final
rehearsal
at
the
scala
of
a
little
play
of
which
he
was
the
unknown
author
signing
himself
simply
castigat
monsieur
de
marquet
was
beginning
to
be
a
noble
old
generally
he
was
extremely
polite
and
full
of
gay
humour
and
in
all
his
life
had
had
but
one
passion
that
of
dramatic
art
throughout
his
magisterial
career
he
was
interested
solely
in
cases
capable
of
furnishing
him
with
something
in
the
nature
of
a
drama
though
he
might
very
well
have
aspired
to
the
highest
judicial
positions
he
had
never
really
worked
for
anything
but
to
win
a
success
at
the
romantic
or
at
the
sombre
odeon
because
of
the
mystery
which
shrouded
it
the
case
of
the
yellow
room
was
certain
to
fascinate
so
theatrical
a
mind
it
interested
him
enormously
and
he
threw
himself
into
it
less
as
a
magistrate
eager
to
know
the
truth
than
as
an
amateur
of
dramatic
embroglios
tending
wholly
to
mystery
and
intrigue
who
dreads
nothing
so
much
as
the
explanatory
final
act
so
that
at
the
moment
of
meeting
him
i
heard
monsieur
de
marquet
say
to
the
registrar
with
a
sigh
i
hope
my
dear
monsieur
maleine
this
builder
with
his
pickaxe
will
not
destroy
so
fine
a
have
no
fear
replied
monsieur
maleine
his
pickaxe
may
demolish
the
pavilion
perhaps
but
it
will
leave
our
case
intact
i
have
sounded
the
walls
and
examined
the
ceiling
and
floor
and
i
know
all
about
it
i
am
not
to
be
having
thus
reassured
his
chief
monsieur
maleine
with
a
discreet
movement
of
the
head
drew
monsieur
de
marquet
s
attention
to
us
the
face
of
that
gentleman
clouded
and
as
he
saw
rouletabille
approaching
hat
in
hand
he
sprang
into
one
of
the
empty
carriages
saying
half
aloud
to
his
registrar
as
he
did
so
above
all
no
journalists
monsieur
maleine
replied
in
the
same
tone
i
understand
and
then
tried
to
prevent
rouletabille
from
entering
the
same
compartment
with
the
examining
magistrate
excuse
me
gentlemen
this
compartment
is
i
am
a
journalist
monsieur
engaged
on
the
epoque
said
my
young
friend
with
a
great
show
of
gesture
and
politeness
and
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
monsieur
de
monsieur
is
very
much
engaged
with
the
inquiry
he
has
in
ah
his
inquiry
pray
believe
me
is
absolutely
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
i
am
no
scavenger
of
odds
and
ends
he
went
on
with
infinite
contempt
in
his
lower
lip
i
am
a
theatrical
reporter
and
this
evening
i
shall
have
to
give
a
little
account
of
the
play
at
the
get
in
sir
please
said
the
registrar
rouletabille
was
already
in
the
compartment
i
went
in
after
him
and
seated
myself
by
his
side
the
registrar
followed
and
closed
the
carriage
door
monsieur
de
marquet
looked
at
him
ah
sir
rouletabille
began
you
must
not
be
angry
with
monsieur
de
maleine
it
is
not
with
monsieur
de
marquet
that
i
desire
to
have
the
honour
of
speaking
but
with
monsieur
castigat
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
personally
as
well
as
the
writer
for
the
and
rouletabille
having
first
introduced
me
introduced
himself
monsieur
de
marquet
with
a
nervous
gesture
caressed
his
beard
into
a
point
and
explained
to
rouletabille
in
a
few
words
that
he
was
too
modest
an
author
to
desire
that
the
veil
of
his
pseudonym
should
be
publicly
raised
and
that
he
hoped
the
enthusiasm
of
the
journalist
for
the
dramatist
s
work
would
not
lead
him
to
tell
the
public
that
monsieur
castigat
ridendo
and
the
examining
magistrate
of
corbeil
were
one
and
the
same
person
the
work
of
the
dramatic
author
may
interfere
he
said
after
a
slight
hesitation
with
that
of
the
magistrate
especially
in
a
province
where
one
s
labours
are
little
more
than
oh
you
may
rely
on
my
discretion
cried
rouletabille
the
train
was
in
motion
we
have
started
said
the
examining
magistrate
surprised
at
seeing
us
still
in
the
carriage
yes
monsieur
truth
has
started
said
rouletabile
smiling
amiably
on
its
way
to
the
chateau
du
glandier
a
fine
case
monsieur
de
marquet
a
fine
case
an
obscure
incredible
unfathomable
inexplicable
affair
and
there
is
only
one
thing
i
fear
monsieur
rouletabille
that
the
journalists
will
be
trying
to
explain
my
friend
felt
this
a
rap
on
his
knuckles
yes
he
said
simply
that
is
to
be
feared
they
meddle
in
everything
as
for
my
interest
monsieur
i
only
referred
to
it
by
mere
chance
the
mere
chance
of
finding
myself
in
the
same
train
with
you
and
in
the
same
compartment
of
the
same
where
are
you
going
then
asked
monsieur
de
marquet
to
the
chateau
du
glandier
replied
rouletabille
without
turning
you
ll
not
get
in
monsieur
rouletabille
will
you
prevent
me
said
my
friend
already
prepared
to
fight
not
i
i
like
the
press
and
journalists
too
well
to
be
in
any
way
disagreeable
to
them
but
monsieur
stangerson
has
given
orders
for
his
door
to
be
closed
against
everybody
and
it
is
well
guarded
not
a
journalist
was
able
to
pass
through
the
gate
of
the
glandier
monsieur
de
marquet
compressed
his
lips
and
seemed
ready
to
relapse
into
obstinate
silence
he
only
relaxed
a
little
when
rouletabille
no
longer
left
him
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
we
were
going
to
the
glandier
for
the
purpose
of
shaking
hands
with
an
old
and
intimate
friend
monsieur
robert
darzac
a
man
whom
rouletabille
had
perhaps
seen
once
in
his
life
poor
robert
continued
the
young
reporter
this
dreadful
affair
may
be
his
death
he
is
so
deeply
in
love
with
mademoiselle
his
sufferings
are
truly
painful
to
witness
escaped
like
a
regret
from
the
lips
of
monsieur
de
marquet
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
life
will
be
let
us
hope
so
her
father
told
me
yesterday
that
if
she
does
not
recover
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
joins
her
in
the
grave
what
an
incalculable
loss
to
science
his
death
would
be
the
wound
on
her
temple
is
serious
is
it
not
evidently
but
by
a
wonderful
chance
it
has
not
proved
mortal
the
blow
was
given
with
great
then
it
was
not
with
the
revolver
she
was
wounded
said
rouletabille
glancing
at
me
in
triumph
monsieur
de
marquet
appeared
greatly
embarrassed
i
didn
t
say
anything
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
i
will
not
say
anything
he
said
and
he
turned
towards
his
registrar
as
if
he
no
longer
knew
us
but
rouletabille
was
not
to
be
so
easily
shaken
off
he
moved
nearer
to
the
examining
magistrate
and
drawing
a
copy
of
the
matin
from
his
pocket
he
showed
it
to
him
and
said
there
is
one
thing
monsieur
which
i
may
enquire
of
you
without
committing
an
indiscretion
you
have
of
course
seen
the
account
given
in
the
matin
it
is
absurd
is
it
not
not
in
the
slightest
what
the
yellow
room
has
but
one
barred
window
the
bars
of
which
have
not
been
moved
and
only
one
door
which
had
to
be
broken
open
and
the
assassin
was
not
found
that
s
so
monsieur
that
s
so
that
s
how
the
matter
rouletabille
said
no
more
but
plunged
into
thought
a
quarter
of
an
hour
thus
passed
coming
back
to
himself
again
he
said
addressing
the
magistrate
how
did
mademoiselle
stangerson
wear
her
hair
on
that
evening
i
don
t
know
replied
monsieur
de
marquet
that
s
a
very
important
point
said
rouletabille
her
hair
was
done
up
in
bands
wasn
t
it
i
feel
sure
that
on
that
evening
the
evening
of
the
crime
she
had
her
hair
arranged
in
then
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
rouletabille
replied
the
magistrate
mademoiselle
stangerson
that
evening
had
her
hair
drawn
up
in
a
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
her
usual
way
of
arranging
it
her
forehead
completely
uncovered
i
can
assure
you
for
we
have
carefully
examined
the
wound
there
was
no
blood
on
the
hair
and
the
arrangement
of
it
has
not
been
disturbed
since
the
crime
was
you
are
sure
you
are
sure
that
on
the
night
of
the
crime
she
had
not
her
hair
in
bands
quite
sure
the
magistrate
continued
smiling
because
i
remember
the
doctor
saying
to
me
while
he
was
examining
the
wound
it
is
a
great
pity
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
in
the
habit
of
drawing
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
if
she
had
worn
it
in
bands
the
blow
she
received
on
the
temple
would
have
been
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
you
should
attach
so
much
importance
to
this
oh
if
she
had
not
her
hair
in
bands
i
give
it
up
said
rouletabille
with
a
despairing
gesture
and
was
the
wound
on
her
temple
a
bad
one
he
asked
presently
with
what
weapon
was
it
made
that
is
a
secret
of
the
have
you
found
the
weapon
whatever
it
was
the
magistrate
did
not
answer
and
the
wound
in
the
throat
here
the
examining
magistrate
readily
confirmed
the
decision
of
the
doctor
that
if
the
murderer
had
pressed
her
throat
a
few
seconds
longer
mademoiselle
stangerson
would
have
died
of
strangulation
the
affair
as
reported
in
the
matin
said
rouletabille
eagerly
seems
to
me
more
and
more
inexplicable
can
you
tell
me
monsieur
how
many
openings
there
are
in
the
pavilion
i
mean
doors
and
there
are
five
replied
monsieur
de
marquet
after
having
coughed
once
or
twice
but
no
longer
resisting
the
desire
he
felt
to
talk
of
the
whole
of
the
incredible
mystery
of
the
affair
he
was
investigating
there
are
five
of
which
the
door
of
the
vestibule
is
the
only
entrance
to
the
pavilion
a
door
always
automatically
closed
which
can
not
be
opened
either
from
the
outer
or
inside
except
with
the
two
special
keys
which
are
never
out
of
the
possession
of
either
daddy
jacques
or
monsieur
stangerson
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
no
need
for
one
since
daddy
jacques
lodged
in
the
pavilion
and
because
during
the
daytime
she
never
left
her
father
when
they
all
four
rushed
into
the
yellow
room
after
breaking
open
the
door
of
the
laboratory
the
door
in
the
vestibule
remained
closed
as
usual
and
of
the
two
keys
for
opening
it
daddy
jacques
had
one
in
his
pocket
and
monsieur
stangerson
the
other
as
to
the
windows
of
the
pavilion
there
are
four
the
one
window
of
the
yellow
room
and
those
of
the
laboratory
looking
out
on
to
the
country
the
window
in
the
vestibule
looking
into
the
it
is
by
that
window
that
he
escaped
from
the
pavilion
cried
rouletabille
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
monsieur
de
marquet
fixing
a
strange
look
on
my
young
friend
we
ll
see
later
how
he
got
away
from
the
yellow
room
replied
rouletabille
but
he
must
have
left
the
pavilion
by
the
vestibule
once
more
how
do
you
know
that
how
oh
the
thing
is
simple
enough
as
soon
as
he
found
he
could
not
escape
by
the
door
of
the
pavilion
his
only
way
out
was
by
the
window
in
the
vestibule
unless
he
could
pass
through
a
grated
window
the
window
of
the
yellow
room
is
secured
by
iron
bars
because
it
looks
out
upon
the
open
country
the
two
windows
of
the
laboratory
have
to
be
protected
in
like
manner
for
the
same
reason
as
the
murderer
got
away
i
conceive
that
he
found
a
window
that
was
not
barred
that
of
the
vestibule
which
opens
on
to
the
park
that
is
to
say
into
the
interior
of
the
estate
there
s
not
much
magic
in
all
yes
said
monsieur
de
marquet
but
what
you
have
not
guessed
is
that
this
single
window
in
the
vestibule
though
it
has
no
iron
bars
has
solid
iron
blinds
now
these
iron
blinds
have
remained
fastened
by
their
iron
latch
and
yet
we
have
proof
that
the
murderer
made
his
escape
from
the
pavilion
by
that
window
traces
of
blood
on
the
inside
wall
and
on
the
blinds
as
well
as
on
the
floor
and
footmarks
of
which
i
have
taken
the
measurements
attest
the
fact
that
the
murderer
made
his
escape
that
way
but
then
how
did
he
do
it
seeing
that
the
blinds
remained
fastened
on
the
inside
he
passed
through
them
like
a
shadow
but
what
is
more
bewildering
than
all
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
form
any
idea
as
to
how
the
murderer
got
out
of
the
yellow
room
or
how
he
got
across
the
laboratory
to
reach
the
vestibule
ah
yes
monsieur
rouletabille
it
is
altogether
as
you
said
a
fine
case
the
key
to
which
will
not
be
discovered
for
a
long
time
i
you
hope
monsieur
monsieur
de
marquet
corrected
himself
i
do
not
hope
so
i
think
could
that
window
have
been
closed
and
refastened
after
the
flight
of
the
assassin
asked
rouletabille
that
is
what
occurred
to
me
for
a
moment
but
it
would
imply
an
accomplice
or
accomplices
and
i
don
t
see
after
a
short
silence
he
added
ah
if
mademoiselle
stangerson
were
only
well
enough
to
be
questioned
rouletabille
following
up
his
thought
asked
and
the
attic
there
must
be
some
opening
to
that
yes
there
is
a
window
or
rather
skylight
in
it
which
as
it
looks
out
towards
the
country
monsieur
stangerson
has
had
barred
like
the
rest
of
the
windows
these
bars
as
in
the
other
windows
have
remained
intact
and
the
blinds
which
naturally
open
inwards
have
not
been
unfastened
for
the
rest
we
have
not
discovered
anything
to
lead
us
to
suspect
that
the
murderer
had
passed
through
the
it
seems
clear
to
you
then
monsieur
that
the
murderer
escaped
nobody
knows
how
by
the
window
in
the
vestibule
everything
goes
to
prove
i
think
so
too
confessed
rouletabille
gravely
after
a
brief
silence
he
continued
if
you
have
not
found
any
traces
of
the
murderer
in
the
attic
such
as
the
dirty
footmarks
similar
to
those
on
the
floor
of
the
yellow
room
you
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
he
who
stole
daddy
jacques
s
there
are
no
footmarks
in
the
attic
other
than
those
of
daddy
jacques
himself
said
the
magistrate
with
a
significant
turn
of
his
head
then
after
an
apparent
decision
he
added
daddy
jacques
was
with
monsieur
stangerson
in
the
laboratory
and
it
was
lucky
for
him
he
then
what
part
did
his
revolver
play
in
the
tragedy
it
seems
very
clear
that
this
weapon
did
less
harm
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
than
it
did
to
the
the
magistrate
made
no
reply
to
this
question
which
doubtless
embarrassed
him
monsieur
stangerson
he
said
tells
us
that
the
two
bullets
have
been
found
in
the
yellow
room
one
embedded
in
the
wall
stained
with
the
impression
of
a
red
hand
a
man
s
large
hand
and
the
other
in
the
oh
oh
in
the
ceiling
muttered
rouletabille
in
the
ceiling
that
s
very
curious
in
the
ceiling
he
puffed
awhile
in
silence
at
his
pipe
enveloping
himself
in
the
smoke
when
we
reached
i
had
to
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
to
arouse
him
from
his
dream
and
come
out
on
to
the
platform
of
the
station
there
the
magistrate
and
his
registrar
bowed
to
us
and
by
rapidly
getting
into
a
cab
that
was
awaiting
them
made
us
understand
that
they
had
seen
enough
of
us
how
long
will
it
take
to
walk
to
the
chateau
du
glandier
rouletabille
asked
one
of
the
railway
porters
an
hour
and
a
half
or
an
hour
and
three
quarters
easy
walking
the
man
replied
rouletabille
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
no
doubt
finding
its
appearance
satisfactory
took
my
arm
and
said
come
on
i
need
a
are
things
getting
less
entangled
i
asked
not
a
bit
of
it
he
said
more
entangled
than
ever
it
s
true
i
have
an
idea
what
s
that
i
asked
i
can
t
tell
you
what
it
is
just
at
present
it
s
an
idea
involving
the
life
or
death
of
two
persons
at
do
you
think
there
were
accomplices
i
don
t
think
it
we
fell
into
silence
presently
he
went
on
it
was
a
bit
of
luck
our
falling
in
with
that
examining
magistrate
and
his
registrar
eh
what
did
i
tell
you
about
that
revolver
his
head
was
bent
down
he
had
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
he
was
whistling
after
a
while
i
heard
him
murmur
poor
woman
is
it
mademoiselle
stangerson
you
are
pitying
yes
she
s
a
noble
woman
and
worthy
of
being
pitied
a
woman
of
a
great
a
very
great
character
i
imagine
i
you
know
her
then
not
at
all
i
have
never
seen
why
then
do
you
say
that
she
is
a
woman
of
great
character
because
she
bravely
faced
the
murderer
because
she
courageously
defended
herself
and
above
all
because
of
the
bullet
in
the
i
looked
at
rouletabille
and
inwardly
wondered
whether
he
was
not
mocking
me
or
whether
he
had
not
suddenly
gone
out
of
his
senses
but
i
saw
that
he
had
never
been
less
inclined
to
laugh
and
the
brightness
of
his
keenly
intelligent
eyes
assured
me
that
he
retained
all
his
reason
then
too
i
was
used
to
his
broken
way
of
talking
which
only
left
me
puzzled
as
to
his
meaning
till
with
a
very
few
clear
rapidly
uttered
words
he
would
make
the
drift
of
his
ideas
clear
to
me
and
i
saw
that
what
he
had
previously
said
and
which
had
appeared
to
me
void
of
meaning
was
so
thoroughly
logical
that
i
could
not
understand
how
it
was
i
had
not
understood
him
sooner
chapter
iv
in
the
bosom
of
wild
nature
the
chateau
du
glandier
is
one
of
the
oldest
chateaux
in
the
ile
de
france
where
so
many
building
remains
of
the
feudal
period
are
still
standing
built
originally
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
in
the
reign
of
philip
le
bel
it
now
could
be
seen
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
road
leading
from
the
village
of
to
monthery
a
mass
of
inharmonious
structures
it
is
dominated
by
a
donjon
when
the
visitor
has
mounted
the
crumbling
steps
of
this
ancient
donjon
he
reaches
a
little
plateau
where
in
the
seventeenth
century
georges
philibert
de
sequigny
lord
of
the
glandier
and
other
places
built
the
existing
town
in
an
abominably
rococo
style
of
architecture
it
was
in
this
place
seemingly
belonging
entirely
to
the
past
that
professor
stangerson
and
his
daughter
installed
themselves
to
lay
the
foundations
for
the
science
of
the
future
its
solitude
in
the
depths
of
woods
was
what
more
than
all
had
pleased
them
they
would
have
none
to
witness
their
labours
and
intrude
on
their
hopes
but
the
aged
stones
and
grand
old
oaks
the
glandier
ancient
glandierum
was
so
called
from
the
quantity
of
glands
acorns
which
in
all
times
had
been
gathered
in
that
neighbourhood
this
land
of
present
mournful
interest
had
fallen
back
owing
to
the
negligence
or
abandonment
of
its
owners
into
the
wild
character
of
primitive
nature
the
buildings
alone
which
were
hidden
there
had
preserved
traces
of
their
strange
metamorphoses
every
age
had
left
on
them
its
imprint
a
bit
of
architecture
with
which
was
bound
up
the
remembrance
of
some
terrible
event
some
bloody
adventure
such
was
the
chateau
in
which
science
had
taken
refuge
a
place
seemingly
designed
to
be
the
theatre
of
mysteries
terror
and
death
having
explained
so
far
i
can
not
refrain
from
making
one
further
reflection
if
i
have
lingered
a
little
over
this
description
of
the
glandier
it
is
not
because
i
have
reached
the
right
moment
for
creating
the
necessary
atmosphere
for
the
unfolding
of
the
tragedy
before
the
eyes
of
the
reader
indeed
in
all
this
matter
my
first
care
will
be
to
be
as
simple
as
is
possible
i
have
no
ambition
to
be
an
author
an
author
is
always
something
of
a
romancer
and
god
knows
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
is
quite
full
enough
of
real
tragic
horror
to
require
no
aid
from
literary
effects
i
am
and
only
desire
to
be
a
faithful
my
duty
is
to
report
the
event
and
i
place
the
event
in
its
frame
that
is
all
it
is
only
natural
that
you
should
know
where
the
things
happened
i
return
to
monsieur
stangerson
when
he
bought
the
estate
fifteen
years
before
the
tragedy
with
which
we
are
engaged
occurred
the
chateau
du
glandier
had
for
a
long
time
been
unoccupied
another
old
chateau
in
the
neighbourhood
built
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
jean
de
belmont
was
also
abandoned
so
that
that
part
of
the
country
was
very
little
inhabited
some
small
houses
on
the
side
of
the
road
leading
to
corbeil
an
inn
called
the
auberge
du
donjon
which
offered
passing
hospitality
to
waggoners
these
were
about
all
to
represent
civilisation
in
this
part
of
the
country
but
a
few
leagues
from
the
capital
but
this
deserted
condition
of
the
place
had
been
the
determining
reason
for
the
choice
made
by
monsieur
stangerson
and
his
daughter
monsieur
stangerson
was
already
celebrated
he
had
returned
from
america
where
his
works
had
made
a
great
stir
the
book
which
he
had
published
at
philadelphia
on
the
dissociation
of
matter
by
electric
action
had
aroused
opposition
throughout
the
whole
scientific
world
monsieur
stangerson
was
a
frenchman
but
of
american
origin
important
matters
relating
to
a
legacy
had
kept
him
for
several
years
in
the
united
states
where
he
had
continued
the
work
begun
by
him
in
france
whither
he
had
returned
in
possession
of
a
large
fortune
this
fortune
was
a
great
boon
to
him
for
though
he
might
have
made
millions
of
dollars
by
exploiting
two
or
three
of
his
chemical
discoveries
relative
to
new
processes
of
dyeing
it
was
always
repugnant
to
him
to
use
for
his
own
private
gain
the
wonderful
gift
of
invention
he
had
received
from
nature
he
considered
he
owed
it
to
mankind
and
all
that
his
genius
brought
into
the
world
went
by
this
philosophical
view
of
his
duty
into
the
public
lap
if
he
did
not
try
to
conceal
his
satisfaction
at
coming
into
possession
of
this
fortune
which
enabled
him
to
give
himself
up
to
his
passion
for
pure
science
he
had
equally
to
rejoice
it
seemed
to
him
for
another
cause
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
at
the
time
when
her
father
returned
from
america
and
bought
the
glandier
estate
twenty
years
of
age
she
was
exceedingly
pretty
having
at
once
the
parisian
grace
of
her
mother
who
had
died
in
giving
her
birth
and
all
the
splendour
all
the
riches
of
the
young
american
blood
of
her
parental
grandfather
william
stangerson
a
citizen
of
philadelphia
william
stangerson
had
been
obliged
to
become
naturalised
in
obedience
to
family
exigencies
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
with
a
french
lady
she
who
was
to
be
the
mother
of
the
illustrious
stangerson
in
that
way
the
professor
s
french
nationality
is
accounted
for
twenty
years
of
age
a
charming
blonde
with
blue
eyes
complexion
and
radiant
with
divine
health
mathilde
stangerson
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
marriageable
girls
in
either
the
old
or
the
new
world
it
was
her
father
s
duty
in
spite
of
the
inevitable
pain
which
a
separation
from
her
would
cause
him
to
think
of
her
marriage
and
he
was
fully
prepared
for
it
nevertheless
he
buried
himself
and
his
child
at
the
glandier
at
the
moment
when
his
friends
were
expecting
him
to
bring
her
out
into
society
some
of
them
expressed
their
astonishment
and
to
their
questions
he
answered
it
is
my
daughter
s
wish
i
can
refuse
her
nothing
she
has
chosen
the
interrogated
in
her
turn
the
young
girl
replied
calmly
where
could
we
work
better
than
in
this
solitude
for
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
already
begun
to
collaborate
with
her
father
in
his
work
it
could
not
at
the
time
be
imagined
that
her
passion
for
science
would
lead
her
so
far
as
to
refuse
all
the
suitors
who
presented
themselves
to
her
for
over
fifteen
years
so
secluded
was
the
life
led
by
the
two
father
and
daughter
that
they
showed
themselves
only
at
a
few
official
receptions
and
at
certain
times
in
the
year
in
two
or
three
friendly
where
the
fame
of
the
professor
and
the
beauty
of
mathilde
made
a
sensation
the
young
girl
s
extreme
reserve
did
not
at
first
discourage
suitors
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
they
tired
of
their
quest
one
alone
persisted
with
tender
tenacity
and
deserved
the
name
of
eternal
fiance
a
name
he
accepted
with
melancholy
resignation
that
was
monsieur
robert
darzac
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
now
no
longer
young
and
it
seemed
that
having
found
no
reason
for
marrying
at
she
would
never
find
one
but
such
an
argument
evidently
found
no
acceptance
with
monsieur
robert
darzac
he
continued
to
pay
his
court
if
the
delicate
and
tender
attention
with
which
he
ceaselessly
surrounded
this
woman
of
could
be
called
courtship
in
face
of
her
declared
intention
never
to
marry
suddenly
some
weeks
before
the
events
with
which
we
are
occupied
a
report
to
which
nobody
attached
any
importance
so
incredible
did
it
sound
was
spread
about
paris
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
at
last
consented
to
crown
the
inextinguishable
flame
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
it
needed
that
monsieur
robert
darzac
himself
should
not
deny
this
matrimonial
rumour
to
give
it
an
appearance
of
truth
so
unlikely
did
it
seem
to
be
well
founded
one
day
however
monsieur
stangerson
as
he
was
leaving
the
academy
of
science
announced
that
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
and
monsieur
robert
darzac
would
be
celebrated
in
the
privacy
of
the
chateau
du
glandier
as
soon
as
he
and
his
daughter
had
put
the
finishing
touches
to
their
report
summing
up
their
labours
on
the
dissociation
of
the
new
household
would
install
itself
in
the
glandier
and
the
would
lend
his
assistance
in
the
work
to
which
the
father
and
daughter
had
dedicated
their
lives
the
scientific
world
had
barely
had
time
to
recover
from
the
effect
of
this
news
when
it
learned
of
the
attempted
assassination
of
mademoiselle
under
the
extraordinary
conditions
which
we
have
detailed
and
which
our
visit
to
the
chateau
was
to
enable
us
to
ascertain
with
yet
greater
precision
i
have
not
hesitated
to
furnish
the
reader
with
all
these
retrospective
details
known
to
me
through
my
business
relations
with
monsieur
robert
darzac
on
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
yellow
room
he
was
as
well
posted
as
i
was
chapter
in
which
joseph
rouletabille
makes
a
remark
to
monsieur
robert
darzac
which
produces
its
little
effect
rouletabille
and
i
had
been
walking
for
several
minutes
by
the
side
of
a
long
wall
bounding
the
vast
property
of
monsieur
stangerson
and
had
already
come
within
sight
of
the
entrance
gate
when
our
attention
was
drawn
to
an
individual
who
half
bent
to
the
ground
seemed
to
be
so
completely
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
as
not
to
have
seen
us
coming
towards
him
at
one
time
he
stooped
so
low
as
almost
to
touch
the
ground
at
another
he
drew
himself
up
and
attentively
examined
the
wall
then
he
looked
into
the
palm
of
one
of
his
hands
and
walked
away
with
rapid
strides
finally
he
set
off
running
still
looking
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
rouletabille
had
brought
me
to
a
standstill
by
a
gesture
hush
frederic
larsan
is
at
work
don
t
let
us
disturb
him
rouletabille
had
a
great
admiration
for
the
celebrated
detective
i
had
never
before
seen
him
but
i
knew
him
well
by
reputation
at
that
time
before
rouletabille
had
given
proof
of
his
unique
talent
larsan
was
reputed
as
the
most
skilful
unraveller
of
the
most
mysterious
and
complicated
crimes
his
reputation
was
and
the
police
of
london
and
even
of
america
often
called
him
in
to
their
aid
when
their
own
national
inspectors
and
detectives
found
themselves
at
the
end
of
their
wits
and
resources
no
one
was
astonished
then
that
the
head
of
the
surete
had
at
the
outset
of
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
telegraphed
his
precious
subordinate
to
london
where
he
had
been
sent
on
a
big
case
of
stolen
securities
to
return
with
all
haste
frederic
who
at
the
surete
was
called
the
great
frederic
had
made
all
speed
doubtless
knowing
by
experience
that
if
he
was
interrupted
in
what
he
was
doing
it
was
because
his
services
were
urgently
needed
in
another
direction
so
as
rouletabille
said
he
was
that
morning
already
at
we
soon
found
out
in
what
it
consisted
what
he
was
continually
looking
at
in
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
was
nothing
but
his
watch
the
minute
hand
of
which
he
appeared
to
be
noting
intently
then
he
turned
back
still
running
stopping
only
when
he
reached
the
park
gate
where
he
again
consulted
his
watch
and
then
put
it
away
in
his
pocket
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
of
discouragement
he
pushed
open
the
park
gate
reclosed
and
locked
it
raised
his
head
and
through
the
bars
perceived
us
rouletabille
rushed
after
him
and
i
followed
frederic
larsan
waited
for
us
monsieur
fred
said
rouletabille
raising
his
hat
and
showing
the
profound
respect
based
on
admiration
which
the
young
reporter
felt
for
the
celebrated
detective
can
you
tell
me
whether
monsieur
robert
darzac
is
at
the
chateau
at
this
moment
here
is
one
of
his
friends
of
the
paris
bar
who
desires
to
speak
with
i
really
don
t
know
monsieur
rouletabille
replied
fred
shaking
hands
with
my
friend
whom
he
had
several
times
met
in
the
course
of
his
difficult
investigations
i
have
not
seen
the
concierges
will
be
able
to
inform
us
no
doubt
said
rouletabille
pointing
to
the
lodge
the
door
and
windows
of
which
were
close
shut
the
concierges
will
not
be
able
to
give
you
any
information
monsieur
why
not
because
they
were
arrested
half
an
hour
arrested
cried
rouletabille
then
they
are
the
murderers
frederic
larsan
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
you
can
t
arrest
the
real
murderer
he
said
with
an
air
of
supreme
irony
you
can
always
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
discovering
did
you
have
them
arrested
monsieur
fred
not
i
i
haven
t
had
them
arrested
in
the
first
place
i
am
pretty
sure
that
they
have
not
had
anything
to
do
with
the
affair
and
then
because
because
of
what
asked
rouletabille
eagerly
because
of
nothing
said
larsan
shaking
his
head
because
there
were
no
accomplices
said
rouletabille
aha
you
have
an
idea
then
about
this
matter
said
larsan
looking
at
rouletabille
intently
yet
you
have
seen
nothing
young
man
you
have
not
yet
gained
admission
here
i
shall
get
i
doubt
it
the
orders
are
i
shall
gain
admission
if
you
let
me
see
monsieur
robert
darzac
do
that
for
me
you
know
we
are
old
friends
i
beg
of
you
monsieur
fred
do
you
remember
the
article
i
wrote
about
you
on
the
gold
bar
case
the
face
of
rouletabille
at
the
moment
was
really
funny
to
look
at
it
showed
such
an
irresistible
desire
to
cross
the
threshold
beyond
which
some
prodigious
mystery
had
occurred
it
appealed
with
so
much
eloquence
not
only
of
the
mouth
and
eyes
but
with
all
its
features
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
bursting
into
laughter
frederic
larsan
no
more
than
myself
could
retain
his
gravity
meanwhile
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
he
calmly
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
i
closely
scrutinised
him
he
might
be
about
fifty
years
of
age
he
had
a
fine
head
his
hair
turning
grey
a
colourless
complexion
and
a
firm
profile
his
forehead
was
prominent
his
chin
and
cheeks
clean
shaven
his
upper
lip
without
moustache
was
finely
chiselled
his
eyes
were
rather
small
and
round
with
a
look
in
them
that
was
at
once
searching
and
disquieting
he
was
of
middle
height
and
well
built
with
a
general
bearing
elegant
and
gentlemanly
there
was
nothing
about
him
of
the
vulgar
policeman
in
his
way
he
was
an
artist
and
one
felt
that
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
himself
the
sceptical
tone
of
his
conversation
was
that
of
a
man
who
had
been
taught
by
experience
his
strange
profession
had
brought
him
into
contact
with
so
many
crimes
and
villanies
that
it
would
have
been
remarkable
if
his
nature
had
not
been
a
little
hardened
larsan
turned
his
head
at
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
which
had
come
from
the
chateau
and
reached
the
gate
behind
him
we
recognised
the
cab
which
had
conveyed
the
examining
magistrate
and
his
registrar
from
the
station
at
epinay
ah
said
frederic
larsan
if
you
want
to
speak
with
monsieur
robert
darzac
he
is
the
cab
was
already
at
the
park
gate
and
robert
darzac
was
begging
frederic
larsan
to
open
it
for
him
explaining
that
he
was
pressed
for
time
to
catch
the
next
train
leaving
epinay
for
paris
then
he
recognised
me
while
larsan
was
unlocking
the
gate
monsieur
darzac
inquired
what
had
brought
me
to
the
glandier
at
such
a
tragic
moment
i
noticed
that
he
was
frightfully
pale
and
that
his
face
was
lined
as
if
from
the
effects
of
some
terrible
suffering
is
mademoiselle
getting
better
i
immediately
asked
yes
he
said
she
will
be
saved
perhaps
she
must
be
saved
he
did
not
add
or
it
will
be
my
death
but
i
felt
that
the
phrase
trembled
on
his
pale
lips
rouletabille
intervened
you
are
in
a
hurry
monsieur
but
i
must
speak
with
you
i
have
something
of
the
greatest
importance
to
tell
frederic
larsan
interrupted
may
i
leave
you
he
asked
of
robert
darzac
have
you
a
key
or
do
you
wish
me
to
give
you
this
thank
you
i
have
a
key
and
will
lock
the
larsan
hurried
off
in
the
direction
of
the
chateau
the
imposing
pile
of
which
could
be
perceived
a
few
hundred
yards
away
robert
darzac
with
knit
brow
was
beginning
to
show
impatience
i
presented
rouletabille
as
a
good
friend
of
mine
but
as
soon
as
he
learnt
that
the
young
man
was
a
journalist
he
looked
at
me
very
reproachfully
excused
himself
under
the
necessity
of
having
to
reach
epinay
in
twenty
minutes
bowed
and
whipped
up
his
horse
but
rouletabille
had
seized
the
bridle
and
to
my
utter
astonishment
stopped
the
carriage
with
a
vigorous
hand
then
he
gave
utterance
to
a
sentence
which
was
utterly
meaningless
to
me
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
the
words
had
no
sooner
left
the
lips
of
rouletabille
than
i
saw
robert
darzac
quail
pale
as
he
was
he
became
paler
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
young
man
in
terror
and
he
immediately
descended
from
the
vehicle
in
an
inexpressible
state
of
agitation
come
come
in
he
stammered
then
suddenly
and
with
a
sort
of
fury
he
repeated
let
us
go
he
turned
up
by
the
road
he
had
come
from
the
chateau
rouletabille
still
retaining
his
hold
on
the
horse
s
bridle
i
addressed
a
few
words
to
monsieur
darzac
but
he
made
no
answer
my
looks
questioned
rouletabille
but
his
gaze
was
elsewhere
chapter
vi
in
the
heart
of
the
oak
grove
we
reached
the
chateau
and
as
we
approached
it
saw
four
gendarmes
pacing
in
front
of
a
little
door
in
the
ground
floor
of
the
donjon
we
soon
learned
that
in
this
ground
floor
which
had
formerly
served
as
a
prison
monsieur
and
madame
bernier
the
concierges
were
confined
monsieur
robert
darzac
led
us
into
the
modern
part
of
the
chateau
by
a
large
door
protected
by
a
projecting
awning
a
marquise
as
it
is
called
rouletabille
who
had
resigned
the
horse
and
the
cab
to
the
care
of
a
servant
never
took
his
eyes
off
monsieur
darzac
i
followed
his
look
and
perceived
that
it
was
directed
solely
towards
the
gloved
hands
of
the
sorbonne
professor
when
we
were
in
a
tiny
fitted
with
old
furniture
monsieur
darzac
turned
to
rouletabille
and
said
sharply
what
do
you
want
the
reporter
answered
in
an
equally
sharp
tone
to
shake
you
by
the
darzac
shrank
back
what
does
that
mean
evidently
he
understood
what
i
also
understood
that
my
friend
suspected
him
of
the
abominable
attempt
on
the
life
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
the
impression
of
the
hand
on
the
walls
of
the
yellow
room
was
in
his
mind
i
looked
at
the
man
closely
his
haughty
face
with
its
expression
ordinarily
so
straightforward
was
at
this
moment
strangely
troubled
he
held
out
his
right
hand
and
referring
to
me
said
as
you
are
a
friend
of
monsieur
sainclair
who
has
rendered
me
invaluable
services
in
a
just
cause
monsieur
i
see
no
reason
for
refusing
you
my
hand
rouletabille
did
not
take
the
extended
hand
lying
with
the
utmost
audacity
he
said
monsieur
i
have
lived
several
years
in
russia
where
i
have
acquired
the
habit
of
never
taking
any
but
an
ungloved
i
thought
that
the
sorbonne
professor
would
express
his
anger
openly
but
on
the
contrary
by
a
visibly
violent
effort
he
calmed
himself
took
off
his
gloves
and
showed
his
hands
they
were
unmarked
by
any
cicatrix
are
you
satisfied
no
replied
rouletabille
my
dear
friend
he
said
turning
to
me
i
am
obliged
to
ask
you
to
leave
us
alone
for
a
i
bowed
and
retired
stupefied
by
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
i
could
not
understand
why
monsieur
robert
darzac
had
not
already
shown
the
door
to
my
impertinent
insulting
and
stupid
friend
i
was
angry
myself
with
rouletabille
at
that
moment
for
his
suspicions
which
had
led
to
this
scene
of
the
gloves
for
some
twenty
minutes
i
walked
about
in
front
of
the
chateau
trying
vainly
to
link
together
the
different
events
of
the
day
what
was
in
rouletabille
s
mind
was
it
possible
that
he
thought
monsieur
robert
darzac
to
be
the
murderer
how
could
it
be
thought
that
this
man
who
was
to
have
married
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
had
introduced
himself
into
the
yellow
room
to
assassinate
his
fiancee
i
could
find
no
explanation
as
to
how
the
murderer
had
been
able
to
leave
the
yellow
room
and
so
long
as
that
mystery
which
appeared
to
me
so
inexplicable
remained
unexplained
i
thought
it
was
the
duty
of
all
of
us
to
refrain
from
suspecting
anybody
but
then
that
seemingly
senseless
phrase
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
brightness
still
rang
in
my
ears
what
did
it
mean
i
was
eager
to
rejoin
rouletabille
and
question
him
at
that
moment
the
young
man
came
out
of
the
chateau
in
the
company
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
and
extraordinary
to
relate
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
they
were
the
best
of
friends
we
are
going
to
the
yellow
room
come
with
us
rouletabille
said
to
me
you
know
my
dear
boy
i
am
going
to
keep
you
with
me
all
day
we
ll
breakfast
together
somewhere
about
here
you
ll
breakfast
with
me
here
gentlemen
no
thanks
replied
the
young
man
we
shall
breakfast
at
the
donjon
you
ll
fare
very
badly
there
you
ll
not
find
anything
do
you
think
so
well
i
hope
to
find
something
there
replied
rouletabille
after
breakfast
we
ll
set
to
work
again
i
ll
write
my
article
and
if
you
ll
be
so
good
as
to
take
it
to
the
office
for
me
won
t
you
come
back
with
me
to
paris
no
i
shall
remain
i
turned
towards
rouletabille
he
spoke
quite
seriously
and
monsieur
robert
darzac
did
not
appear
to
be
in
the
least
degree
surprised
we
were
passing
by
the
donjon
and
heard
wailing
voices
rouletabille
asked
why
have
these
people
been
arrested
it
is
a
little
my
fault
said
monsieur
darzac
i
happened
to
remark
to
the
examining
magistrate
yesterday
that
it
was
inexplicable
that
the
concierges
had
had
time
to
hear
the
revolver
shots
to
dress
themselves
and
to
cover
so
great
a
distance
as
that
which
lies
between
their
lodge
and
the
pavilion
in
the
space
of
two
minutes
for
not
more
than
that
interval
of
time
had
elapsed
after
the
firing
of
the
shots
when
they
were
met
by
daddy
that
was
suspicious
evidently
acquiesced
rouletabille
and
were
they
dressed
that
is
what
is
so
incredible
they
were
dressed
completely
not
one
part
of
their
costume
wanting
the
woman
wore
sabots
but
the
man
had
on
laced
boots
now
they
assert
that
they
went
to
bed
at
nine
on
arriving
this
morning
the
examining
magistrate
brought
with
him
from
paris
a
revolver
of
the
same
calibre
as
that
found
in
the
room
for
he
couldn
t
use
the
one
held
for
evidence
and
made
his
registrar
fire
two
shots
in
the
yellow
room
while
the
doors
and
windows
were
closed
we
were
with
him
in
the
lodge
of
the
concierges
and
yet
we
heard
nothing
not
a
sound
the
concierges
have
lied
of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
they
must
have
been
already
waiting
not
far
from
the
pavilion
waiting
for
something
certainly
they
are
not
to
be
accused
of
being
the
authors
of
the
crime
but
their
complicity
is
not
improbable
that
was
why
monsieur
de
marquet
had
them
arrested
at
if
they
had
been
accomplices
said
rouletabille
they
would
not
have
been
there
at
all
when
people
throw
themselves
into
the
arms
of
justice
with
the
proofs
of
complicity
on
them
you
can
be
sure
they
are
not
accomplices
i
don
t
believe
there
are
any
accomplices
in
this
then
why
were
they
abroad
at
midnight
why
don
t
they
say
they
have
certainly
some
reason
for
their
silence
what
that
reason
is
has
to
be
found
out
for
even
if
they
are
not
accomplices
it
may
be
of
importance
everything
that
took
place
on
such
a
night
is
we
had
crossed
an
old
bridge
thrown
over
the
douve
and
were
entering
the
part
of
the
park
called
the
oak
grove
the
oaks
here
were
centuries
old
autumn
had
already
shrivelled
their
tawny
leaves
and
their
high
branches
black
and
contorted
looked
like
horrid
heads
of
hair
mingled
with
quaint
reptiles
such
as
the
ancient
sculptors
have
made
on
the
head
of
medusa
this
place
which
mademoiselle
found
cheerful
and
in
which
she
lived
in
the
summer
season
appeared
to
us
as
sad
and
funereal
now
the
soil
was
black
and
muddy
from
the
recent
rains
and
the
rotting
of
the
fallen
leaves
the
trunks
of
the
trees
were
black
and
the
sky
above
us
was
now
as
if
in
mourning
charged
with
great
heavy
clouds
and
it
was
in
this
sombre
and
desolate
retreat
that
we
saw
the
white
walls
of
the
pavilion
as
we
approached
a
building
without
a
window
visible
on
the
side
by
which
we
neared
it
a
little
door
alone
marked
the
entrance
to
it
it
might
have
passed
for
a
tomb
a
vast
mausoleum
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
forest
as
we
came
nearer
we
were
able
to
make
out
its
disposition
the
building
obtained
all
the
light
it
needed
from
the
south
that
is
to
say
from
the
open
country
the
little
door
closed
on
the
park
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
must
have
found
it
an
ideal
seclusion
for
their
work
and
their
dreams

here
is
the

plan
of

had
a
which
was
reached
by
a

steps
and
above
it
was
an
attic
with
which
we
need
not
concern
ourselves
the
plan
of
the
only
sketched
roughly
is
what
i
here
submit
to
the
reader
the

room
with
its
one

and
its
one
door
opening
into
the
laboratory

its
two
large
barred
windows
and
its
doors

and
the
only
chimney
in
the
pavilion
serving
for
the
experiments
of
the
laboratory
the
plan
was
drawn
by
rouletabille
and
i
assured
myself
that
there
was
not
a
line
in
it
that
was
wanting
to
help
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
then
set
before
the
police
with
the
lines
of
this
plan
and
the
description
of
its
parts
before
them
my
readers
will
know
as
much
as
rouletabille
knew
when
he
entered
the
pavilion
for
the
first
time
with
him
they
may
now
ask
how
did
the
murderer
escape
from
the
yellow
room
before
mounting
the
three
steps
leading
up
to
the
door
of
the
pavilion
rouletabille
stopped
and
asked
monsieur
darzac
point
blank
what
was
the
motive
for
the
crime
speaking
for
myself
monsieur
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
the
matter
said
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
greatly
distressed
the
nails
of
the
fingers
the
deep
scratches
on
the
chest
and
throat
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
show
that
the
wretch
who
attacked
her
attempted
to
commit
a
frightful
crime
the
medical
experts
who
examined
these
traces
yesterday
affirm
that
they
were
made
by
the
same
hand
as
that
which
left
its
red
imprint
on
the
wall
an
enormous
hand
monsieur
much
too
large
to
go
into
my
gloves
he
added
with
an
indefinable
smile
could
not
that
hand
i
interrupted
have
been
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
who
in
the
moment
of
falling
had
pressed
it
against
the
wall
and
in
slipping
enlarged
the
impression
there
was
not
a
drop
of
blood
on
either
of
her
hands
when
she
was
lifted
up
replied
monsieur
darzac
we
are
now
sure
said
i
that
it
was
mademoiselle
stangerson
who
was
armed
with
daddy
jacques
s
revolver
since
she
wounded
the
hand
of
the
murderer
she
was
in
fear
then
of
somebody
or
do
you
suspect
anybody
no
replied
monsieur
darzac
looking
at
rouletabille
rouletabille
then
said
to
me
you
must
know
my
friend
that
the
inquiry
is
a
little
more
advanced
than
monsieur
de
marquet
has
chosen
to
tell
us
he
not
only
knows
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
defended
herself
with
the
revolver
but
he
knows
what
the
weapon
was
that
was
used
to
attack
her
monsieur
darzac
tells
me
it
was
a
why
is
monsieur
de
marquet
surrounding
this
with
so
much
mystery
no
doubt
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
inquiries
of
the
agents
of
the
surete
he
imagines
perhaps
that
the
owner
of
this
instrument
of
crime
the
most
terrible
invented
is
going
to
be
found
amongst
those
who
are
in
the
slums
of
paris
who
use
it
but
who
can
ever
say
what
passes
through
the
brain
of
an
examining
magistrate
rouletabille
added
with
contemptuous
irony
has
a
been
found
in
the
yellow
room
i
asked
him
yes
monsieur
said
robert
darzac
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
i
beg
of
you
not
to
say
anything
about
i
made
a
gesture
of
assent
it
was
an
enormous
the
top
of
which
or
rather
the
joint
was
still
red
with
the
blood
of
the
frightful
wound
it
was
an
old
bone
which
may
according
to
appearances
have
served
in
other
crimes
that
s
what
monsieur
de
marquet
thinks
he
has
had
it
sent
to
the
municipal
laboratory
at
paris
to
be
analysed
in
fact
he
thinks
he
has
detected
on
it
not
only
the
blood
of
the
last
victim
but
other
stains
of
dried
blood
evidences
of
previous
a
in
the
hand
of
a
skilled
assassin
is
a
frightful
weapon
said
rouletabille
a
more
certain
weapon
than
a
heavy
the
scoundrel
has
proved
it
to
be
so
said
monsieur
robert
darzac
sadly
the
joint
of
the
bone
found
exactly
fits
the
wound
inflicted
my
belief
is
that
the
wound
would
have
been
mortal
if
the
murderer
s
blow
had
not
been
arrested
in
the
act
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
revolver
wounded
in
the
hand
he
dropped
the
and
fled
unfortunately
the
blow
had
been
already
given
and
mademoiselle
was
stunned
after
having
been
nearly
strangled
if
she
had
succeeded
in
wounding
the
man
with
the
first
shot
of
the
revolver
she
would
doubtless
have
escaped
the
blow
with
the
bone
but
she
had
certainly
employeeed
her
revolver
too
late
the
first
shot
deviated
and
lodged
in
the
ceiling
it
was
the
second
only
that
took
having
said
this
monsieur
darzac
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
i
must
confess
to
feeling
a
strong
impatience
to
reach
the
spot
where
the
crime
had
been
committed
it
was
some
time
before
the
door
was
opened
by
a
man
whom
i
at
once
recognised
as
daddy
jacques
he
appeared
to
be
well
over
sixty
years
of
age
he
had
a
long
white
beard
and
white
hair
on
which
he
wore
a
flat
basque
cap
he
was
dressed
in
a
complete
suit
of
velveteen
worn
at
the
sides
sabots
were
on
his
feet
he
had
rather
a
face
the
expression
of
which
lightened
however
as
soon
as
he
saw
monsieur
darzac
friends
said
our
guide
nobody
in
the
pavilion
daddy
jacques
i
ought
not
to
allow
anybody
to
enter
monsieur
robert
but
of
course
the
order
does
not
apply
to
you
these
gentlemen
of
justice
have
seen
everything
there
is
to
be
seen
and
made
enough
drawings
and
drawn
up
enough
reports
excuse
me
monsieur
jacques
one
question
before
anything
else
said
rouletabille
what
is
it
young
man
if
i
can
answer
it
did
your
mistress
wear
her
hair
in
bands
that
evening
you
know
what
i
mean
over
her
forehead
no
young
man
my
mistress
never
wore
her
hair
in
the
way
you
suggest
neither
on
that
day
nor
on
any
other
she
had
her
hair
drawn
up
as
usual
so
that
her
beautiful
forehead
could
be
seen
pure
as
that
of
an
unborn
child
rouletabille
grunted
and
set
to
work
examining
the
door
finding
that
it
fastened
itself
automatically
he
satisfied
himself
that
it
could
never
remain
open
and
needed
a
key
to
open
it
then
we
entered
the
vestibule
a
small
room
paved
with
square
red
tiles
ah
this
is
the
window
by
which
the
murderer
escaped
said
rouletabille
so
they
keep
on
saying
monsieur
so
they
keep
on
saying
but
if
he
had
gone
off
that
way
we
should
have
been
sure
to
have
seen
him
we
are
not
blind
neither
monsieur
stangerson
nor
me
nor
the
concierges
who
are
in
prison
why
have
they
not
put
me
in
prison
too
on
account
of
my
revolver
rouletabille
had
already
opened
the
window
and
was
examining
the
shutters
were
these
closed
at
the
time
of
the
crime
and
fastened
with
the
iron
catch
inside
said
daddy
jacques
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
murderer
did
not
get
out
that
are
there
any
blood
stains
yes
on
the
stones
outside
but
blood
of
what
ah
said
rouletabille
there
are
footmarks
visible
on
the
path
the
ground
was
very
moist
i
will
look
into
that
nonsense
interrupted
daddy
jacques
the
murderer
did
not
go
that
which
way
did
he
go
then
how
do
i
know
rouletabille
looked
at
everything
smelled
everything
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
rapidly
examined
every
one
of
the
paving
tiles
daddy
jacques
went
on
ah
you
can
t
find
anything
monsieur
nothing
has
been
found
and
now
it
is
all
dirty
too
many
persons
have
tramped
over
it
they
wouldn
t
let
me
wash
it
but
on
the
day
of
the
crime
i
had
washed
the
floor
thoroughly
and
if
the
murderer
had
crossed
it
with
his
hobnailed
boots
i
should
not
have
failed
to
see
where
he
had
been
he
has
left
marks
enough
in
mademoiselle
s
rouletabille
rose
when
was
the
last
time
you
washed
these
tiles
he
asked
and
he
fixed
on
daddy
jacques
a
most
searching
look
why
as
i
told
you
on
the
day
of
the
crime
towards
five
while
mademoiselle
and
her
father
were
taking
a
little
walk
before
dinner
here
in
this
room
they
had
dined
in
the
laboratory
the
next
day
the
examining
magistrate
came
and
saw
all
the
marks
there
were
on
the
floor
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
been
made
with
ink
on
white
paper
well
neither
in
the
laboratory
nor
in
the
vestibule
which
were
both
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
were
there
any
traces
of
a
man
s
footmarks
since
they
have
been
found
near
this
window
outside
he
must
have
made
his
way
through
the
ceiling
of
the
yellow
room
into
the
attic
then
cut
his
way
through
the
roof
and
dropped
to
the
ground
outside
the
vestibule
window
but
there
s
no
hole
neither
in
the
ceiling
of
the
yellow
room
nor
in
the
roof
of
my
attic
that
s
absolutely
certain
so
you
see
we
know
nothing
nothing
and
nothing
will
ever
be
known
it
s
a
mystery
of
the
devil
s
own
rouletabille
went
down
upon
his
knees
again
almost
in
front
of
a
small
lavatory
at
the
back
of
the
vestibule
in
that
position
he
remained
for
about
a
minute
well
i
asked
him
when
he
got
up
oh
nothing
very
important
a
drop
of
blood
he
replied
turning
towards
daddy
jacques
as
he
spoke
while
you
were
washing
the
laboratory
and
this
vestibule
was
the
vestibule
window
open
he
asked
no
monsieur
it
was
closed
but
after
i
had
done
washing
the
floor
i
lit
some
charcoal
for
monsieur
in
the
laboratory
furnace
and
as
i
lit
it
with
old
newspapers
it
smoked
so
i
opened
both
the
windows
in
the
laboratory
and
this
one
to
make
a
current
of
air
then
i
shut
those
in
the
laboratory
and
left
this
one
open
when
i
went
out
when
i
returned
to
the
pavilion
this
window
had
been
closed
and
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
were
already
at
work
in
the
monsieur
or
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
no
doubt
shut
it
no
you
did
not
ask
them
after
a
close
scrutiny
of
the
little
lavatory
and
of
the
staircase
leading
up
to
the
attic
rouletabille
to
whom
we
seemed
no
longer
to
exist
entered
the
laboratory
i
followed
him
it
was
i
confess
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
robert
darzac
lost
none
of
my
friend
s
movements
as
for
me
my
eyes
were
drawn
at
once
to
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
it
was
closed
and
as
i
immediately
saw
partially
shattered
and
out
of
commission
my
friend
who
went
about
his
work
methodically
silently
studied
the
room
in
which
we
were
it
was
large
and
two
big
windows
almost
bays
were
protected
by
strong
iron
bars
and
looked
out
upon
a
wide
extent
of
country
through
an
opening
in
the
forest
they
commanded
a
wonderful
view
through
the
length
of
the
valley
and
across
the
plain
to
the
large
town
which
could
be
clearly
seen
in
fair
weather
however
a
mist
hung
over
the
ground
and
blood
in
that
room
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
laboratory
was
taken
up
with
a
large
chimney
crucibles
ovens
and
such
implements
as
are
needed
for
chemical
experiments
tables
loaded
with
phials
papers
reports
an
electrical
machine
an
apparatus
as
monsieur
darzac
informed
me
employeeed
by
professor
stangerson
to
demonstrate
the
dissociation
of
matter
under
the
action
of
solar
light
and
other
scientific
implements
along
the
walls
were
cabinets
plain
or
through
which
were
visible
microscopes
special
photographic
apparatus
and
a
large
quantity
of
crystals
rouletabille
who
was
ferreting
in
the
chimney
put
his
fingers
into
one
of
the
crucibles
suddenly
he
drew
himself
up
and
held
up
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
he
stepped
up
to
where
we
were
talking
by
one
of
the
windows
keep
that
for
us
monsieur
darzac
he
said
i
bent
over
the
piece
of
scorched
paper
which
monsieur
darzac
took
from
the
hand
of
rouletabille
and
read
distinctly
the
only
words
that
remained
legible
presbytery
lost
nothing
charm
nor
the
gar
its
twice
since
the
morning
these
same
meaningless
words
had
struck
me
and
for
the
second
time
i
saw
that
they
produced
on
the
sorbonne
professor
the
same
paralysing
effect
monsieur
darzac
s
first
anxiety
showed
itself
when
he
turned
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
daddy
jacques
but
occupied
as
he
was
at
another
window
he
had
seen
nothing
then
tremblingly
opening
his
he
put
the
piece
of
paper
into
it
sighing
my
god
during
this
time
rouletabille
had
mounted
into
the
opening
of
the
that
is
to
say
he
had
got
upon
the
bricks
of
a
furnace
and
was
attentively
examining
the
chimney
which
grew
narrower
towards
the
top
the
outlet
from
it
being
closed
with
sheets
of
iron
fastened
into
the
brickwork
through
which
passed
three
small
chimneys
impossible
to
get
out
that
way
he
said
jumping
back
into
the
laboratory
besides
even
if
he
had
tried
to
do
it
he
would
have
brought
all
that
ironwork
down
to
the
ground
no
no
it
is
not
on
that
side
we
have
to
rouletabille
next
examined
the
furniture
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
cabinet
then
he
came
to
the
windows
through
which
he
declared
no
one
could
possibly
have
passed
at
the
second
window
he
found
daddy
jacques
in
contemplation
well
daddy
jacques
he
said
what
are
you
looking
at
that
policeman
who
is
always
going
round
and
round
the
lake
another
of
those
fellows
who
think
they
can
see
better
than
anybody
else
you
don
t
know
frederic
larsan
daddy
jacques
or
you
wouldn
t
speak
of
him
in
that
way
said
rouletabille
in
a
melancholy
tone
if
there
is
anyone
who
will
find
the
murderer
it
will
be
and
rouletabille
heaved
a
deep
sigh
before
they
find
him
they
will
have
to
learn
how
they
lost
him
said
daddy
jacques
stolidly
at
length
we
reached
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
itself
there
is
the
door
behind
which
some
terrible
scene
took
place
said
rouletabille
with
a
solemnity
which
under
any
other
circumstances
would
have
been
comical
chapter
vii
in
which
rouletabille
sets
out
on
an
expedition
under
the
bed
rouletabille
having
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
paused
on
the
threshold
saying
with
an
emotion
which
i
only
later
understood
ah
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
the
chamber
was
dark
daddy
jacques
was
about
to
open
the
blinds
when
rouletabille
stopped
him
did
not
the
tragedy
take
place
in
complete
darkness
he
asked
no
young
man
i
don
t
think
so
mademoiselle
always
had
a
nightlight
on
her
table
and
i
lit
it
every
evening
before
she
went
to
bed
i
was
a
sort
of
chambermaid
you
must
understand
when
the
evening
came
the
real
chambermaid
did
not
come
here
much
before
the
morning
mademoiselle
worked
late
far
into
the
where
did
the
table
with
the
stand
far
from
the
bed
some
way
from
the
can
you
light
the
burner
now
the
lamp
is
broken
and
the
oil
that
was
in
it
was
spilled
when
the
table
was
upset
all
the
rest
of
the
things
in
the
room
remain
just
as
they
were
i
have
only
to
open
the
blinds
for
you
to
rouletabille
went
back
into
the
laboratory
closed
the
shutters
of
the
two
windows
and
the
door
of
the
vestibule
when
we
were
in
complete
darkness
he
lit
a
wax
vesta
and
asked
daddy
jacques
to
move
to
the
middle
of
the
chamber
with
it
to
the
place
where
the
was
burning
that
night
daddy
jacques
who
was
in
his
stockings
he
usually
left
his
sabots
in
the
vestibule
entered
the
yellow
room
with
his
bit
of
a
vesta
we
vaguely
distinguished
objects
overthrown
on
the
floor
a
bed
in
one
corner
and
in
front
of
us
to
the
left
the
gleam
of
a
hanging
on
the
wall
near
to
the
bed
that
will
do
you
may
now
open
the
blinds
said
rouletabille
don
t
come
any
further
daddy
jacques
begged
you
may
make
marks
with
your
boots
and
nothing
must
be
deranged
it
s
an
idea
of
the
magistrate
s
though
he
has
nothing
more
to
do
and
he
pushed
open
the
shutter
the
pale
daylight
entered
from
without
throwing
a
sinister
light
on
the
walls
the
floor
for
though
the
laboratory
and
the
vestibule
were
tiled
the
yellow
room
had
a
flooring
of
wood
was
covered
with
a
single
yellow
mat
which
was
large
enough
to
cover
nearly
the
whole
room
under
the
bed
and
under
the
the
only
piece
of
furniture
that
remained
upright
the
centre
round
table
the
and
two
chairs
had
been
overturned
these
did
not
prevent
a
large
stain
of
blood
being
visible
on
the
mat
made
as
daddy
jacques
informed
us
by
the
blood
which
had
flowed
from
the
wound
on
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
forehead
besides
these
stains
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
in
all
directions
in
line
with
the
visible
traces
of
the
footsteps
large
and
black
of
the
murderer
everything
led
to
the
presumption
that
these
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
from
the
wound
of
the
man
who
had
for
a
moment
placed
his
red
hand
on
the
wall
there
were
other
traces
of
the
same
hand
on
the
wall
but
much
less
distinct
see
see
this
blood
on
the
wall
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
the
man
who
pressed
his
hand
so
heavily
upon
it
in
the
darkness
must
certainly
have
thought
that
he
was
pushing
at
a
door
that
s
why
he
pressed
on
it
so
hard
leaving
on
the
yellow
paper
the
terrible
evidence
i
don
t
think
there
are
many
hands
in
the
world
of
that
sort
it
is
big
and
strong
and
the
fingers
are
nearly
all
one
as
long
as
the
other
the
thumb
is
wanting
and
we
have
only
the
mark
of
the
palm
but
if
we
follow
the
trace
of
the
hand
i
continued
we
see
that
after
leaving
its
imprint
on
the
wall
the
touch
sought
the
door
found
it
and
then
felt
for
the
lock
no
doubt
interrupted
rouletabille
chuckling
only
there
is
no
blood
either
on
the
lock
or
on
the
bolt
what
does
that
prove
i
rejoined
with
a
good
sense
of
which
i
was
proud
he
might
have
opened
the
lock
with
his
left
hand
which
would
have
been
quite
natural
his
right
hand
being
he
didn
t
open
it
at
all
daddy
jacques
again
exclaimed
we
are
not
fools
and
there
were
four
of
us
when
we
burst
open
the
door
what
a
queer
hand
look
what
a
queer
hand
it
is
i
said
it
is
a
very
natural
hand
said
rouletabille
of
which
the
shape
has
been
deformed
by
its
having
slipped
on
the
wall
the
man
dried
his
hand
on
the
wall
he
must
be
a
man
about
five
feet
eight
in
how
do
you
come
at
that
by
the
height
of
the
marks
on
the
my
friend
next
occupied
himself
with
the
mark
of
the
bullet
in
the
wall
it
was
a
round
hole
this
ball
was
fired
straight
not
from
above
and
consequently
not
from
rouletabille
went
back
to
the
door
and
carefully
examined
the
lock
and
the
bolt
satisfying
himself
that
the
door
had
certainly
been
burst
open
from
the
outside
and
further
that
the
key
had
been
found
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
of
the
chamber
he
finally
satisfied
himself
that
with
the
key
in
the
lock
the
door
could
not
possibly
be
opened
from
without
with
another
key
having
made
sure
of
all
these
details
he
let
fall
these
words
that
s
better
then
sitting
down
on
the
ground
he
hastily
took
off
his
boots
and
in
his
socks
went
into
the
room
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
examine
minutely
the
overturned
furniture
we
watched
him
in
silence
young
fellow
you
are
giving
yourself
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
daddy
jacques
ironically
rouletabille
raised
his
head
and
said
you
have
spoken
the
simple
truth
daddy
jacques
your
mistress
did
not
have
her
hair
in
bands
that
evening
i
was
a
donkey
to
have
believed
she
then
with
the
suppleness
of
a
serpent
he
slipped
under
the
bed
presently
we
heard
him
ask
at
what
time
monsieur
jacques
did
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
arrive
at
the
laboratory
at
six
o
the
voice
of
rouletabille
continued
yes
he
s
been
under
here
that
s
certain
in
fact
there
was
no
where
else
where
he
could
have
hidden
himself
here
too
are
the
marks
of
his
hobnails
when
you
entered
all
four
of
you
did
you
look
under
the
bed
at
once
we
drew
it
right
out
of
its
place
and
between
the
mattresses
there
was
only
one
on
the
bed
and
on
that
mademoiselle
was
placed
and
monsieur
stangerson
and
the
concierge
immediately
carried
it
into
the
laboratory
under
the
mattress
there
was
nothing
but
the
metal
netting
which
could
not
conceal
anything
or
anybody
remember
monsieur
that
there
were
four
of
us
and
we
couldn
t
fail
to
see
everything
the
chamber
is
so
small
and
scantily
furnished
and
all
was
locked
behind
in
the
i
ventured
on
a
hypothesis
perhaps
he
got
away
with
the
mattress
in
the
mattress
anything
is
possible
in
the
face
of
such
a
mystery
in
their
distress
of
mind
monsieur
stangerson
and
the
concierge
may
not
have
noticed
they
were
bearing
a
double
weight
especially
if
the
concierge
were
an
accomplice
i
throw
out
this
hypothesis
for
what
it
is
worth
but
it
explains
many
things
and
particularly
the
fact
that
neither
the
laboratory
nor
the
vestibule
bear
any
traces
of
the
footmarks
found
in
the
room
if
in
carrying
mademoiselle
on
the
mattress
from
the
laboratory
of
the
chateau
they
rested
for
a
moment
there
might
have
been
an
opportunity
for
the
man
in
it
to
escape
and
then
asked
rouletabille
deliberately
laughing
under
the
bed
i
felt
rather
vexed
and
replied
i
don
t
know
but
anything
appears
possible
the
examining
magistrate
had
the
same
idea
monsieur
said
daddy
jacques
and
he
carefully
examined
the
mattress
he
was
obliged
to
laugh
at
the
idea
monsieur
as
your
friend
is
doing
now
for
whoever
heard
of
a
mattress
having
a
double
bottom
i
was
myself
obliged
to
laugh
on
seeing
that
what
i
had
said
was
absurd
but
in
an
affair
like
this
one
hardly
knows
where
an
absurdity
begins
or
ends
my
friend
alone
seemed
able
to
talk
intelligently
he
called
out
from
under
the
bed
the
mat
here
has
been
moved
out
of
place
who
did
it
we
did
monsieur
explained
daddy
jacques
when
we
could
not
find
the
assassin
we
asked
ourselves
whether
there
was
not
some
hole
in
the
floor
there
is
not
replied
rouletabille
is
there
a
cellar
no
there
s
no
cellar
but
that
has
not
stopped
our
searching
and
has
not
prevented
the
examining
magistrate
and
his
registrar
from
studying
the
floor
plank
by
plank
as
if
there
had
been
a
cellar
under
the
reporter
then
reappeared
his
eyes
were
sparkling
and
his
nostrils
quivered
he
remained
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
could
not
be
better
likened
than
to
an
admirable
sporting
dog
on
the
scent
of
some
unusual
game
and
indeed
he
was
scenting
the
steps
of
a
man
the
man
whom
he
has
sworn
to
report
to
his
master
the
manager
of
the
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
rouletabille
was
first
and
last
a
journalist
thus
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
made
his
way
to
the
four
corners
of
the
room
so
to
speak
sniffing
and
going
round
everything
everything
that
we
could
see
which
was
not
much
and
everything
that
we
could
not
see
which
must
have
been
infinite
the
toilette
table
was
a
simple
table
standing
on
four
legs
there
was
nothing
about
it
by
which
it
could
possibly
be
changed
into
a
temporary
there
was
not
a
closet
or
cupboard
mademoiselle
stangerson
kept
her
wardrobe
at
the
chateau
rouletabille
literally
passed
his
nose
and
hands
along
the
walls
constructed
of
solid
brickwork
when
he
had
finished
with
the
walls
and
passed
his
agile
fingers
over
every
portion
of
the
yellow
paper
covering
them
he
reached
to
the
ceiling
which
he
was
able
to
touch
by
mounting
on
a
chair
placed
on
the
toilette
table
and
by
moving
this
ingeniously
constructed
stage
from
place
to
place
he
examined
every
foot
of
it
when
he
had
finished
his
scrutiny
of
the
ceiling
where
he
carefully
examined
the
hole
made
by
the
second
bullet
he
approached
the
window
and
once
more
examined
the
iron
bars
and
blinds
all
of
which
were
solid
and
intact
at
last
he
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
declared
now
i
am
at
ease
well
do
you
believe
that
the
poor
dear
young
lady
was
shut
up
when
she
was
being
murdered
when
she
cried
out
for
help
wailed
daddy
jacques
yes
said
the
young
reporter
drying
his
forehead
the
yellow
room
was
as
tightly
shut
as
an
iron
that
i
said
is
why
this
mystery
is
the
most
surprising
i
know
edgar
allan
poe
in
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
invented
nothing
like
it
the
place
of
that
crime
was
sufficiently
closed
to
prevent
the
escape
of
a
man
but
there
was
that
window
through
which
the
monkey
the
perpetrator
of
the
murder
could
slip
away
but
here
there
can
be
no
question
of
an
opening
of
any
sort
the
door
was
fastened
and
through
the
window
blinds
secure
as
they
were
not
even
a
fly
could
enter
or
get
true
true
assented
rouletabille
as
he
kept
on
drying
his
forehead
which
seemed
to
be
perspiring
less
from
his
recent
bodily
exertion
than
from
his
mental
agitation
indeed
it
s
a
great
a
beautiful
and
a
very
curious
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
muttered
daddy
jacques
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
herself
if
she
had
committed
the
crime
could
not
have
escaped
listen
do
you
hear
it
hush
daddy
jacques
made
us
a
sign
to
keep
quiet
and
stretching
his
arm
towards
the
wall
nearest
the
forest
listened
to
something
which
we
could
not
hear
it
s
answering
he
said
at
length
i
must
kill
it
it
is
too
wicked
but
it
s
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
and
every
night
it
goes
to
pray
on
the
tomb
of
and
nobody
dares
to
touch
her
for
fear
that
mother
angenoux
should
cast
an
evil
spell
on
how
big
is
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
nearly
as
big
as
a
small
retriever
a
monster
i
tell
you
ah
i
have
asked
myself
more
than
once
whether
it
was
not
her
that
took
our
poor
mademoiselle
by
the
throat
with
her
claws
but
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
does
not
wear
hobnailed
boots
nor
fire
revolvers
nor
has
she
a
hand
like
that
exclaimed
daddy
jacques
again
pointing
out
to
us
the
red
mark
on
the
wall
besides
we
should
have
seen
her
as
well
as
we
would
have
seen
a
man
evidently
i
said
before
we
had
seen
this
yellow
room
i
had
also
asked
myself
whether
the
cat
of
mother
angenoux
you
also
cried
rouletabille
didn
t
you
i
asked
not
for
a
moment
after
reading
the
article
in
the
matin
i
knew
that
a
cat
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
but
i
swear
now
that
a
frightful
tragedy
has
been
enacted
here
you
say
nothing
about
the
basque
cap
or
the
handkerchief
found
here
daddy
jacques
of
course
the
magistrate
has
taken
them
the
old
man
answered
hesitatingly
i
haven
t
seen
either
the
handkerchief
or
the
cap
yet
i
can
tell
you
how
they
are
made
the
reporter
said
to
him
gravely
oh
you
are
very
clever
said
daddy
jacques
coughing
and
embarrassed
the
handkerchief
is
a
large
one
blue
with
red
stripes
and
the
cap
is
an
old
basque
cap
like
the
one
you
are
wearing
you
are
a
wizard
said
daddy
jacques
trying
to
laugh
and
not
quite
succeeding
how
do
you
know
that
the
handkerchief
is
blue
with
red
stripes
because
if
it
had
not
been
blue
with
red
stripes
it
would
not
have
been
found
at
without
giving
any
further
attention
to
daddy
jacques
my
friend
took
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
taking
out
a
pair
of
scissors
bent
over
the
footprints
placing
the
paper
over
one
of
them
he
began
to
cut
in
a
short
time
he
had
made
a
perfect
pattern
which
he
handed
to
me
begging
me
not
to
lose
it
he
then
returned
to
the
window
and
pointing
to
the
figure
of
frederic
larsan
who
had
not
quitted
the
side
of
the
lake
asked
daddy
jacques
whether
the
detective
had
like
himself
been
working
in
the
yellow
room
no
replied
robert
darzac
who
since
rouletabille
had
handed
him
the
piece
of
scorched
paper
had
not
uttered
a
word
he
pretends
that
he
does
not
need
to
examine
the
yellow
room
he
says
that
the
murderer
made
his
escape
from
it
in
quite
a
natural
way
and
that
he
will
this
evening
explain
how
he
did
as
he
listened
to
what
monsieur
darzac
had
to
say
rouletabille
turned
pale
has
frederic
larsan
found
out
the
truth
which
i
can
only
guess
at
he
murmured
he
is
very
clever
very
clever
and
i
admire
him
but
what
we
have
to
do
is
something
more
than
the
work
of
a
policeman
something
quite
different
from
the
teachings
of
experience
we
have
to
take
hold
of
our
reason
by
the
right
the
reporter
rushed
into
the
open
air
agitated
by
the
thought
that
the
great
and
famous
fred
might
anticipate
him
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
yellow
room
i
managed
to
reach
him
on
the
threshold
of
the
pavilion
calm
yourself
my
dear
fellow
i
said
aren
t
you
satisfied
yes
he
confessed
to
me
with
a
deep
sigh
i
am
quite
satisfied
i
have
discovered
many
moral
or
material
several
moral
one
material
this
for
and
rapidly
he
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
he
had
placed
a
hair
from
a
woman
s
head
chapter
viii
the
examining
magistrate
questions
mademoiselle
stangerson
two
minutes
later
as
rouletabille
was
bending
over
the
footprints
discovered
in
the
park
under
the
window
of
the
vestibule
a
man
evidently
a
servant
at
the
chateau
came
towards
us
rapidly
and
called
out
to
monsieur
darzac
then
coming
out
of
the
pavilion
monsieur
robert
the
magistrate
you
know
is
questioning
monsieur
darzac
uttered
a
muttered
excuse
to
us
and
set
off
running
towards
the
chateau
the
man
running
after
him
if
the
corpse
can
speak
i
said
it
would
be
interesting
to
be
we
must
know
said
my
friend
let
s
go
to
the
and
he
drew
me
with
him
but
at
the
chateau
a
gendarme
placed
in
the
vestibule
denied
us
admission
up
the
staircase
of
the
first
floor
we
were
obliged
to
wait
down
stairs
this
is
what
passed
in
the
chamber
of
the
victim
while
we
were
waiting
below
the
family
doctor
finding
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
much
better
but
fearing
a
relapse
which
would
no
longer
permit
of
her
being
questioned
had
thought
it
his
duty
to
inform
the
examining
magistrate
of
this
who
decided
to
proceed
immediately
with
a
brief
examination
at
this
examination
the
registrar
monsieur
stangerson
and
the
doctor
were
present
later
i
obtained
the
text
of
the
report
of
the
examination
and
i
give
it
here
in
all
its
legal
dryness
question
are
you
able
mademoiselle
without
too
much
fatiguing
yourself
to
give
some
necessary
details
of
the
frightful
attack
of
which
you
have
been
the
victim
answer
i
feel
much
better
monsieur
and
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
when
i
entered
my
chamber
i
did
not
notice
anything
unusual
there
q
excuse
me
mademoiselle
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
ask
you
some
questions
and
you
will
answer
them
that
will
fatigue
you
less
than
making
a
long
recital
a
do
so
monsieur
q
what
did
you
do
on
that
day
i
want
you
to
be
as
minute
and
precise
as
possible
i
wish
to
know
all
you
did
that
day
if
it
is
not
asking
too
much
of
you
a
i
rose
late
at
ten
o
clock
for
my
father
and
i
had
returned
home
late
on
the
night
previously
having
been
to
dinner
at
the
reception
given
by
the
president
of
the
republic
in
honour
of
the
academy
of
science
of
philadelphia
when
i
left
my
chamber
at
ten
my
father
was
already
at
work
in
the
laboratory
we
worked
together
till
midday
we
then
took
s
walk
in
the
park
as
we
were
accustomed
to
do
before
breakfasting
at
the
chateau
after
breakfast
we
took
another
walk
for
half
an
hour
and
then
returned
to
the
laboratory
there
we
found
my
chambermaid
who
had
come
to
set
my
room
in
order
i
went
into
the
yellow
room
to
give
her
some
slight
orders
and
she
directly
afterwards
left
the
pavilion
and
i
resumed
my
work
with
my
father
at
five
o
clock
we
again
went
for
a
walk
in
the
park
and
afterward
had
tea
q
before
leaving
the
pavilion
at
five
o
clock
did
you
go
into
your
chamber
a
no
monsieur
my
father
went
into
it
at
my
request
to
bring
me
my
hat
q
and
he
found
nothing
suspicious
there
a
evidently
no
monsieur
q
it
is
then
almost
certain
that
the
murderer
was
not
yet
concealed
under
the
bed
when
you
went
out
was
the
door
of
the
room
locked
a
no
there
was
no
reason
for
locking
it
q
you
were
absent
from
the
pavilion
some
length
of
time
monsieur
stangerson
and
you
a
about
an
hour
q
it
was
during
that
hour
no
doubt
that
the
murderer
got
into
the
pavilion
but
how
nobody
knows
footmarks
have
been
found
in
the
park
leading
away
from
the
window
of
the
vestibule
but
none
has
been
found
going
towards
it
did
you
notice
whether
the
vestibule
window
was
open
when
you
went
out
a
i
don
t
remember
monsieur
stangerson
it
was
closed
q
and
when
you
returned
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
did
not
notice
m
stangerson
it
was
still
closed
i
remember
remarking
aloud
daddy
jacques
must
surely
have
opened
it
while
we
were
q
strange
do
you
recollect
monsieur
stangerson
if
during
your
absence
and
before
going
out
he
had
opened
it
you
returned
to
the
laboratory
at
six
o
clock
and
resumed
work
mademoiselle
stangerson
yes
monsieur
q
and
you
did
not
leave
the
laboratory
from
that
hour
up
to
the
moment
when
you
entered
your
chamber
m
stangerson
neither
my
daughter
nor
i
monsieur
we
were
engaged
on
work
that
was
pressing
and
we
lost
not
a
moment
neglecting
everything
else
on
that
account
q
did
you
dine
in
the
laboratory
a
for
that
reason
q
are
you
accustomed
to
dine
in
the
laboratory
a
we
rarely
dine
there
q
could
the
murderer
have
known
that
you
would
dine
there
that
evening
m
stangerson
good
heavens
i
think
not
it
was
only
when
we
returned
to
the
pavilion
at
six
o
clock
that
we
decided
my
daughter
and
i
to
dine
there
at
that
moment
i
was
spoken
to
by
my
gamekeeper
who
detained
me
a
moment
to
ask
me
to
accompany
him
on
an
urgent
tour
of
inspection
in
a
part
of
the
woods
which
i
had
decided
to
thin
i
put
this
off
until
the
next
day
and
begged
him
as
he
was
going
by
the
chateau
to
tell
the
steward
that
we
should
dine
in
the
laboratory
he
left
me
to
execute
the
errand
and
i
rejoined
my
daughter
who
was
already
at
work
q
at
what
hour
mademoiselle
did
you
go
to
your
chamber
while
your
father
continued
to
work
there
a
at
midnight
q
did
daddy
jacques
enter
the
yellow
room
in
the
course
of
the
evening
a
to
shut
the
blinds
and
light
the
q
he
saw
nothing
suspicious
a
he
would
have
told
us
if
he
had
seen
daddy
jacques
is
an
honest
man
and
very
attached
to
me
q
you
affirm
monsieur
stangerson
that
daddy
jacques
remained
with
you
all
the
time
you
were
in
the
laboratory
m
stangerson
i
am
sure
of
it
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
q
when
you
entered
your
chamber
mademoiselle
you
immediately
shut
the
door
and
locked
and
bolted
it
that
was
taking
unusual
precautions
knowing
that
your
father
and
your
servant
were
there
were
you
in
fear
of
something
then
a
my
father
would
be
returning
to
the
chateau
and
daddy
jacques
would
be
going
to
his
bed
and
in
fact
i
did
fear
something
q
you
were
so
much
in
fear
of
something
that
you
borrowed
daddy
jacques
s
revolver
without
telling
him
you
had
done
so
a
that
is
true
i
did
not
wish
to
alarm
anybody
the
more
because
my
fears
might
have
proved
to
have
been
foolish
q
what
was
it
you
feared
a
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
for
several
nights
i
seemed
to
hear
both
in
the
park
and
out
of
the
park
round
the
pavilion
unusual
sounds
sometimes
footsteps
at
other
times
the
cracking
of
branches
the
night
before
the
attack
on
me
when
i
did
not
get
to
bed
before
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
our
return
from
the
elysee
i
stood
for
a
moment
before
my
window
and
i
felt
sure
i
saw
shadows
q
how
many
a
two
they
moved
round
the
lake
then
the
moon
became
clouded
and
i
lost
sight
of
them
at
this
time
of
the
season
every
year
i
have
generally
returned
to
my
apartment
in
the
chateau
for
the
winter
but
this
year
i
said
to
myself
that
i
would
not
quit
the
pavilion
before
my
father
had
finished
the
resume
of
his
works
on
the
dissociation
of
matter
for
the
academy
i
did
not
wish
that
that
important
work
which
was
to
have
been
finished
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
should
be
delayed
by
a
change
in
our
daily
habit
you
can
well
understand
that
i
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
my
childish
fears
to
my
father
nor
did
i
say
anything
to
daddy
jacques
who
i
knew
would
not
have
been
able
to
hold
his
tongue
knowing
that
he
had
a
revolver
in
his
room
i
took
advantage
of
his
absence
and
borrowed
it
placing
it
in
the
drawer
of
my
q
you
know
of
no
enemies
you
have
a
none
q
you
understand
mademoiselle
that
these
precautions
are
calculated
to
cause
surprise
m
stangerson
evidently
my
child
such
precautions
are
very
surprising
a
no
because
i
have
told
you
that
i
had
been
uneasy
for
two
nights
m
stangerson
you
ought
to
have
told
me
of
that
this
misfortune
would
have
been
avoided
q
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
locked
did
you
go
to
bed
a
yes
and
being
very
tired
i
at
once
went
to
sleep
q
the
was
still
burning
a
yes
but
it
gave
a
very
feeble
light
q
then
mademoiselle
tell
us
what
happened
a
i
do
not
know
whether
i
had
been
long
asleep
but
suddenly
i
awoke
and
uttered
a
loud
cry
m
stangerson
yes
a
horrible
cry
murder
it
still
rings
in
my
ears
q
you
uttered
a
loud
cry
a
a
man
was
in
my
chamber
he
sprang
at
me
and
tried
to
strangle
me
i
was
nearly
stifled
when
suddenly
i
was
able
to
reach
the
drawer
of
my
and
grasp
the
revolver
which
i
had
placed
in
it
at
that
moment
the
man
had
forced
me
to
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
brandished
in
over
my
head
a
sort
of
mace
but
i
had
fired
he
immediately
struck
a
terrible
blow
at
my
head
all
that
monsieur
passed
more
rapidly
than
i
can
tell
it
and
i
know
nothing
more
q
nothing
have
you
no
idea
as
to
how
the
assassin
could
escape
from
your
chamber
a
none
whatever
i
know
nothing
more
one
does
not
know
what
is
passing
around
one
when
one
is
unconscious
q
was
the
man
you
saw
tall
or
short
little
or
big
a
i
only
saw
a
shadow
which
appeared
to
me
formidable
q
you
can
not
give
us
any
indication
a
i
know
nothing
more
monsieur
than
that
a
man
threw
himself
upon
me
and
that
i
fired
at
him
i
know
nothing
here
the
interrogation
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
concluded
rouletabille
waited
patiently
for
monsieur
robert
darzac
who
soon
appeared
from
a
room
near
the
chamber
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
had
heard
the
interrogatory
and
now
came
to
recount
it
to
my
friend
with
great
exactitude
aided
by
an
excellent
memory
his
docility
still
surprised
me
thanks
to
hasty
he
was
able
to
reproduce
almost
textually
the
questions
and
the
answers
given
it
looked
as
if
monsieur
darzac
were
being
employeeed
as
the
secretary
of
my
young
friend
and
acted
as
if
he
could
refuse
him
nothing
nay
more
as
if
under
a
compulsion
to
do
so
the
fact
of
the
closed
window
struck
the
reporter
as
it
had
struck
the
magistrate
rouletabille
asked
darzac
to
repeat
once
more
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
account
of
how
she
and
her
father
had
spent
their
time
on
the
day
of
the
tragedy
as
she
had
stated
it
to
the
magistrate
the
circumstance
of
the
dinner
in
the
laboratory
seemed
to
interest
him
in
the
highest
degree
and
he
had
it
repeated
to
him
three
times
he
also
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
knew
that
the
professor
and
his
daughter
were
going
to
dine
in
the
laboratory
and
how
he
had
come
to
know
it
when
monsieur
darzac
had
finished
i
said
the
examination
has
not
advanced
the
problem
it
has
put
it
back
said
monsieur
darzac
it
has
thrown
light
upon
it
said
rouletabille
thoughtfully
chapter
ix
reporter
and
detective
the
three
of
us
went
back
towards
the
pavilion
at
some
distance
from
the
building
the
reporter
made
us
stop
and
pointing
to
a
small
clump
of
trees
to
the
right
of
us
said
that
s
where
the
murderer
came
from
to
get
into
the
as
there
were
other
patches
of
trees
of
the
same
sort
between
the
great
oaks
i
asked
why
the
murderer
had
chosen
that
one
rather
than
any
of
the
others
rouletabille
answered
me
by
pointing
to
the
path
which
ran
quite
close
to
the
thicket
to
the
door
of
the
pavilion
that
path
is
as
you
see
topped
with
gravel
he
said
the
man
must
have
passed
along
it
going
to
the
pavilion
since
no
traces
of
his
steps
have
been
found
on
the
soft
ground
the
man
didn
t
have
wings
he
walked
but
he
walked
on
the
gravel
which
left
no
impression
of
his
tread
the
gravel
has
in
fact
been
trodden
by
many
other
feet
since
the
path
is
the
most
direct
way
between
the
pavilion
and
the
chateau
as
to
the
thicket
made
of
the
sort
of
shrubs
that
don
t
flourish
in
the
rough
season
laurels
and
fuchsias
it
offered
the
murderer
a
sufficient
until
it
was
time
for
him
to
make
his
way
to
the
pavilion
it
was
while
hiding
in
that
clump
of
trees
that
he
saw
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
then
daddy
jacques
leave
the
pavilion
gravel
has
been
spread
nearly
very
nearly
up
to
the
windows
of
the
pavilion
the
footprints
of
a
man
parallel
with
the
wall
marks
which
we
will
examine
presently
and
which
i
have
already
seen
prove
that
he
only
needed
to
make
one
stride
to
find
himself
in
front
of
the
vestibule
window
left
open
by
daddy
jacques
the
man
drew
himself
up
by
his
hands
and
entered
the
after
all
it
is
very
possible
i
said
after
all
what
after
all
what
cried
rouletabille
i
begged
of
him
not
to
be
angry
but
he
was
too
much
irritated
to
listen
to
me
and
declared
ironically
that
he
admired
the
prudent
doubt
with
which
certain
people
approached
the
most
simple
problems
risking
nothing
by
saying
that
is
so
or
that
is
not
their
intelligence
would
have
produced
about
the
same
result
if
nature
had
forgotten
to
furnish
their
with
a
little
grey
matter
as
i
appeared
vexed
my
young
friend
took
me
by
the
arm
and
admitted
that
he
had
not
meant
that
for
me
he
thought
more
of
me
than
that
if
i
did
not
reason
as
i
do
in
regard
to
this
gravel
he
went
on
i
should
have
to
assume
a
balloon
my
dear
fellow
the
science
of
the
aerostation
of
dirigible
balloons
is
not
yet
developed
enough
for
me
to
consider
it
and
suppose
that
a
murderer
would
drop
from
the
clouds
so
don
t
say
a
thing
is
possible
when
it
could
not
be
otherwise
we
know
now
how
the
man
entered
by
the
window
and
we
also
know
the
moment
at
which
he
entered
during
the
five
o
clock
walk
of
the
professor
and
his
daughter
the
fact
of
the
presence
of
the
chambermaid
who
had
come
to
clean
up
the
yellow
room
in
the
laboratory
when
monsieur
stangerson
and
his
daughter
returned
from
their
walk
at
one
permits
us
to
affirm
that
at
one
the
murderer
was
not
in
the
chamber
under
the
bed
unless
he
was
in
collusion
with
the
chambermaid
what
do
you
say
monsieur
darzac
monsieur
darzac
shook
his
head
and
said
he
was
sure
of
the
chambermaid
s
fidelity
and
that
she
was
a
thoroughly
honest
and
devoted
servant
besides
he
added
at
five
o
clock
monsieur
stangerson
went
into
the
room
to
fetch
his
daughter
s
there
is
that
also
said
rouletabille
that
the
man
entered
by
the
window
at
the
time
you
say
i
admit
i
said
but
why
did
he
shut
the
window
it
was
an
act
which
would
necessarily
draw
the
attention
of
those
who
had
left
it
it
may
be
the
window
was
not
shut
at
once
replied
the
young
reporter
but
if
he
did
shut
the
window
it
was
because
of
the
bend
in
the
gravel
path
a
dozen
yards
from
the
pavilion
and
on
account
of
the
three
oaks
that
are
growing
at
that
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
monsieur
darzac
who
had
followed
us
and
listened
with
almost
breathless
attention
to
all
that
rouletabille
had
said
i
ll
explain
all
to
you
later
on
monsieur
when
i
think
the
moment
to
be
ripe
for
doing
so
but
i
don
t
think
i
have
anything
of
more
importance
to
say
on
this
affair
if
my
hypothesis
is
and
what
is
your
hypothesis
you
will
never
know
if
it
does
not
turn
out
to
be
the
truth
it
is
of
much
too
grave
a
nature
to
speak
of
it
so
long
as
it
continues
to
be
only
a
have
you
at
least
some
idea
as
to
who
the
murderer
is
no
monsieur
i
don
t
know
who
the
murderer
is
but
don
t
be
afraid
monsieur
robert
darzac
i
shall
i
could
not
but
observe
that
monsieur
darzac
was
deeply
moved
and
i
suspected
that
rouletabille
s
confident
assertion
was
not
pleasing
to
him
why
i
asked
myself
if
he
was
really
afraid
that
the
murderer
should
be
discovered
was
he
helping
the
reporter
to
find
him
my
young
friend
seemed
to
have
received
the
same
impression
for
he
said
bluntly
monsieur
darzac
don
t
you
want
me
to
find
out
who
the
murderer
was
oh
i
should
like
to
kill
him
with
my
own
hand
cried
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
with
a
vehemence
that
amazed
me
i
believe
you
said
rouletabille
gravely
but
you
have
not
answered
my
we
were
passing
by
the
thicket
of
which
the
young
reporter
had
spoken
to
us
a
minute
before
i
entered
it
and
pointed
out
evident
traces
of
a
man
who
had
been
hidden
there
rouletabille
once
more
was
right
yes
yes
he
said
we
have
to
do
with
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
who
uses
the
same
means
that
we
do
it
ll
all
come
out
on
those
having
said
this
he
asked
me
for
the
paper
pattern
of
the
footprint
which
he
had
given
me
to
take
care
of
and
applied
it
to
a
very
clear
footmark
behind
the
thicket
aha
he
said
rising
i
thought
he
was
now
going
to
trace
back
the
track
of
the
murderer
s
footmarks
to
the
vestibule
window
but
he
led
us
instead
far
to
the
left
saying
that
it
was
useless
ferreting
in
the
mud
and
that
he
was
sure
now
of
the
road
taken
by
the
murderer
he
went
along
the
wall
to
the
hedge
and
dry
ditch
over
which
he
jumped
see
just
in
front
of
the
little
path
leading
to
the
lake
that
was
his
nearest
way
to
get
how
do
you
know
he
went
to
the
lake
because
frederic
larsan
has
not
quitted
the
borders
of
it
since
this
morning
there
must
be
some
important
marks
a
few
minutes
later
we
reached
the
lake
it
was
a
little
sheet
of
marshy
water
surrounded
by
reeds
on
which
floated
some
dead
leaves
the
great
fred
may
have
seen
us
approaching
but
we
probably
interested
him
very
little
for
he
took
hardly
any
notice
of
us
and
continued
to
be
stirring
with
his
cane
something
which
we
could
not
see
look
said
rouletabille
here
again
are
the
footmarks
of
the
escaping
man
they
skirt
the
lake
here
and
finally
disappear
just
before
this
path
which
leads
to
the
high
road
to
epinay
the
man
continued
his
flight
to
what
makes
you
think
that
i
asked
since
these
footmarks
are
not
continued
on
the
path
what
makes
me
think
that
why
these
footprints
which
i
expected
to
find
he
cried
pointing
to
the
sharply
outlined
imprint
of
a
neat
boot
see
and
he
called
to
frederic
larsan
monsieur
fred
these
neat
footprints
seem
to
have
been
made
since
the
discovery
of
the
yes
young
man
yes
they
have
been
carefully
made
replied
fred
without
raising
his
head
you
see
there
are
steps
that
come
and
steps
that
go
and
the
man
had
a
bicycle
cried
the
reporter
here
after
looking
at
the
marks
of
the
bicycle
which
followed
going
and
coming
the
neat
footprints
i
thought
i
might
intervene
the
bicycle
explains
the
disappearance
of
the
murderer
s
big
i
said
the
murderer
with
his
rough
boots
mounted
a
bicycle
his
accomplice
the
wearer
of
the
neat
boots
had
come
to
wait
for
him
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
with
the
bicycle
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
murderer
was
working
for
the
no
no
replied
rouletabille
with
a
strange
smile
i
have
expected
to
find
these
footmarks
from
the
very
beginning
these
are
not
the
footmarks
of
the
murderer
then
there
were
two
no
there
was
but
one
and
he
had
no
very
good
very
good
cried
frederic
larsan
look
continued
the
young
reporter
showing
us
the
ground
where
it
had
been
disturbed
by
big
and
heavy
heels
the
man
seated
himself
there
and
took
off
his
hobnailed
boots
which
he
had
worn
only
for
the
purpose
of
misleading
detection
and
then
no
doubt
taking
them
away
with
him
he
stood
up
in
his
own
boots
and
quietly
and
slowly
regained
the
high
road
holding
his
bicycle
in
his
hand
for
he
could
not
venture
to
ride
it
on
this
rough
path
that
accounts
for
the
lightness
of
the
impression
made
by
the
wheels
along
it
in
spite
of
the
softness
of
the
ground
if
there
had
been
a
man
on
the
bicycle
the
wheels
would
have
sunk
deeply
into
the
soil
no
no
there
was
but
one
man
there
the
murderer
on
bravo
bravo
cried
fred
again
and
coming
suddenly
towards
us
and
planting
himself
in
front
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
he
said
to
him
if
we
had
a
bicycle
here
we
might
demonstrate
the
correctness
of
the
young
man
s
reasoning
monsieur
robert
darzac
do
you
know
whether
there
is
one
at
the
chateau
no
replied
monsieur
darzac
there
is
not
i
took
mine
four
days
ago
to
paris
the
last
time
i
came
to
the
chateau
before
the
that
s
a
pity
replied
fred
very
coldly
then
turning
to
rouletabille
he
said
if
we
go
on
at
this
rate
we
ll
both
come
to
the
same
conclusion
have
you
any
idea
as
to
how
the
murderer
got
away
from
the
yellow
room
yes
said
my
young
friend
i
have
an
so
have
i
said
fred
and
it
must
be
the
same
as
yours
there
are
no
two
ways
of
reasoning
in
this
affair
i
am
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
my
chief
before
offering
any
explanation
to
the
examining
ah
is
the
chief
of
the
surete
coming
yes
this
afternoon
he
is
going
to
summon
before
the
magistrate
in
the
laboratory
all
those
who
have
played
any
part
in
this
tragedy
it
will
be
very
interesting
it
is
a
pity
you
won
t
be
able
to
be
i
shall
be
present
said
rouletabille
confidently
really
you
are
an
extraordinary
fellow
for
your
age
replied
the
detective
in
a
tone
not
wholly
free
from
irony
you
d
make
a
wonderful
detective
if
you
had
a
little
more
method
if
you
didn
t
follow
your
instincts
and
that
bump
on
your
forehead
as
i
have
already
several
times
observed
monsieur
rouletabille
you
reason
too
much
you
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
guided
by
what
you
have
seen
what
do
you
say
to
the
handkerchief
full
of
blood
and
the
red
mark
of
the
hand
on
the
wall
you
have
seen
the
stain
on
the
wall
but
i
have
only
seen
the
bah
cried
rouletabille
the
murderer
was
wounded
in
the
hand
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
revolver
ah
a
simply
instinctive
observation
take
care
you
are
becoming
too
strictly
logical
monsieur
rouletabille
logic
will
upset
you
if
you
use
it
indiscriminately
you
are
right
when
you
say
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
fired
her
revolver
but
you
are
wrong
when
you
say
that
she
wounded
the
murderer
in
the
i
am
sure
of
it
cried
rouletabille
fred
imperturbable
interrupted
him
defective
observation
defective
observation
the
examination
of
the
handkerchief
the
numberless
little
round
scarlet
stains
the
impression
of
drops
which
i
found
in
the
tracks
of
the
footprints
at
the
moment
when
they
were
made
on
the
floor
prove
to
me
that
the
murderer
was
not
wounded
at
all
monsieur
rouletabille
the
murderer
bled
at
the
nose
the
great
fred
spoke
quite
seriously
however
i
could
not
refrain
from
uttering
an
exclamation
the
reporter
looked
gravely
at
fred
who
looked
gravely
at
him
and
fred
immediately
concluded
the
man
allowed
the
blood
to
flow
into
his
hand
and
handkerchief
and
dried
his
hand
on
the
wall
the
fact
is
highly
important
he
added
because
there
is
no
need
of
his
being
wounded
in
the
hand
for
him
to
be
the
rouletabille
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
after
a
moment
he
said
there
is
something
a
something
monsieur
frederic
larsan
much
graver
than
the
misuse
of
logic
the
disposition
of
mind
in
some
detectives
which
makes
them
in
perfect
good
faith
twist
logic
to
the
necessities
of
their
preconceived
ideas
you
already
have
your
idea
about
the
murderer
monsieur
fred
don
t
deny
it
and
your
theory
demands
that
the
murderer
should
not
have
been
wounded
in
the
hand
otherwise
it
comes
to
nothing
and
you
have
searched
and
have
found
something
else
it
s
dangerous
very
dangerous
monsieur
fred
to
go
from
a
preconceived
idea
to
find
the
proofs
to
fit
it
that
method
may
lead
you
far
astray
beware
of
judicial
error
monsieur
fred
it
will
trip
you
up
and
laughing
a
little
in
a
slightly
bantering
tone
his
hands
in
his
pockets
rouletabille
fixed
his
cunning
eyes
on
the
great
fred
frederic
larsan
silently
contemplated
the
young
reporter
who
pretended
to
be
as
wise
as
himself
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
bowed
to
us
and
moved
quickly
away
hitting
the
stones
on
his
path
with
his
stout
cane
rouletabille
watched
his
retreat
and
then
turned
toward
us
his
face
joyous
and
triumphant
i
shall
beat
him
he
cried
i
shall
beat
the
great
fred
clever
as
he
is
i
shall
beat
them
all
and
he
danced
a
double
shuffle
suddenly
he
stopped
my
eyes
followed
his
gaze
they
were
fixed
on
monsieur
robert
darzac
who
was
looking
anxiously
at
the
impression
left
by
his
feet
side
by
side
with
the
elegant
footmarks
there
was
not
a
particle
of
difference
between
them
we
thought
he
was
about
to
faint
his
eyes
bulging
with
terror
avoided
us
while
his
right
hand
with
a
spasmodic
movement
twitched
at
the
beard
that
covered
his
honest
gentle
and
now
despairing
face
at
length
regaining
his
he
bowed
to
us
and
remarking
in
a
changed
voice
that
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
the
chateau
left
us
the
deuce
exclaimed
rouletabille
he
also
appeared
to
be
deeply
concerned
from
his
he
took
a
piece
of
white
paper
as
i
had
seen
him
do
before
and
with
his
scissors
cut
out
the
shape
of
the
neat
bootmarks
that
were
on
the
ground
then
he
fitted
the
new
paper
pattern
with
the
one
he
had
previously
made
the
two
were
exactly
alike
rising
rouletabille
exclaimed
again
the
deuce
presently
he
added
yet
i
believe
monsieur
robert
darzac
to
be
an
honest
he
then
led
me
on
the
road
to
the
donjon
inn
which
we
could
see
on
the
highway
by
the
side
of
a
small
clump
of
trees
chapter
x
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
meat
now
the
donjon
inn
was
of
no
imposing
appearance
but
i
like
these
buildings
with
their
rafters
blackened
with
age
and
the
smoke
of
their
hearths
these
inns
of
the
crumbling
erections
that
will
soon
exist
in
the
memory
only
they
belong
to
the
bygone
days
they
are
linked
with
history
they
make
us
think
of
the
road
of
those
days
when
highwaymen
rode
i
saw
at
once
that
the
donjon
inn
was
at
least
two
centuries
old
perhaps
older
under
its
over
the
threshold
a
man
with
a
face
was
standing
seemingly
plunged
in
unpleasant
thought
if
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
and
the
knitting
of
his
brows
were
any
indication
when
we
were
close
to
him
he
deigned
to
see
us
and
asked
us
in
a
tone
anything
but
engaging
whether
we
wanted
anything
he
was
no
doubt
the
not
very
amiable
landlord
of
this
charming
as
we
expressed
a
hope
that
he
would
be
good
enough
to
furnish
us
with
a
breakfast
he
assured
us
that
he
had
no
provisions
regarding
us
as
he
said
this
with
a
look
that
was
unmistakably
suspicious
you
may
take
us
in
rouletabille
said
to
him
we
are
not
i
m
not
afraid
of
the
police
i
m
not
afraid
of
anyone
replied
the
man
i
had
made
my
friend
understand
by
a
sign
that
we
should
do
better
not
to
insist
but
being
determined
to
enter
the
inn
he
slipped
by
the
man
on
the
doorstep
and
was
in
the
common
room
come
on
he
said
it
is
very
comfortable
a
good
fire
was
blazing
in
the
chimney
and
we
held
our
hands
to
the
warmth
it
sent
out
it
was
a
morning
in
which
the
approach
of
winter
was
unmistakable
the
room
was
a
tolerably
large
one
furnished
with
two
heavy
tables
some
stools
a
counter
decorated
with
rows
of
bottles
of
syrup
and
alcohol
three
windows
looked
out
on
to
the
road
a
coloured
advertisement
lauded
the
many
merits
of
a
new
vermouth
on
the
mantelpiece
was
arrayed
the
innkeeper
s
collection
of
figured
earthenware
pots
and
stone
jugs
that
s
a
fine
fire
for
roasting
a
chicken
said
rouletabille
we
have
no
chicken
not
even
a
wretched
rabbit
said
the
landlord
i
know
said
my
friend
slowly
i
know
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
meat
i
confess
i
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
rouletabille
meant
by
what
he
had
said
but
the
landlord
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
words
uttered
an
oath
which
he
at
once
stifled
and
placed
himself
at
our
orders
as
obediently
as
monsieur
robert
darzac
had
done
when
he
heard
rouletabille
s
prophetic
sentence
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
certainly
my
friend
knew
how
to
make
people
understand
him
by
the
use
of
wholly
incomprehensible
phrases
i
observed
as
much
to
him
but
he
merely
smiled
i
should
have
proposed
that
he
give
me
some
explanation
but
he
put
a
finger
to
his
lips
which
evidently
signified
that
he
had
not
only
determined
not
to
speak
but
also
enjoined
silence
on
my
part
meantime
the
man
had
pushed
open
a
little
side
door
and
called
to
somebody
to
bring
him
half
a
dozen
eggs
and
a
piece
of
beefsteak
the
commission
was
quickly
executed
by
a
young
woman
with
beautiful
blonde
hair
and
large
handsome
eyes
who
regarded
us
with
curiosity
the
innkeeper
said
to
her
roughly
get
out
and
if
the
green
man
comes
don
t
let
me
see
she
disappeared
rouletabille
took
the
eggs
which
had
been
brought
to
him
in
a
bowl
and
the
meat
which
was
on
a
dish
placed
all
carefully
beside
him
in
the
chimney
unhooked
a
and
a
gridiron
and
began
to
beat
up
our
omelette
before
proceeding
to
grill
our
beefsteak
he
then
ordered
two
bottles
of
cider
and
seemed
to
take
as
little
notice
of
our
host
as
our
host
did
of
him
the
landlord
let
us
do
our
own
cooking
and
set
our
table
near
one
of
the
windows
suddenly
i
heard
him
mutter
ah
there
he
his
face
had
changed
expressing
fierce
hatred
he
went
and
glued
himself
to
one
of
the
windows
watching
the
road
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
draw
rouletabille
s
attention
he
had
already
left
our
omelette
and
had
joined
the
landlord
at
the
window
i
went
with
him
a
man
dressed
entirely
in
green
velvet
his
head
covered
with
a
huntsman
s
cap
of
the
same
colour
was
advancing
leisurely
lighting
a
pipe
as
he
walked
he
carried
a
slung
at
his
back
his
movements
displayed
an
almost
aristocratic
ease
he
wore
and
appeared
to
be
about
five
and
forty
years
of
age
his
hair
as
well
as
his
moustache
were
salt
grey
he
was
remarkably
handsome
as
he
passed
near
the
inn
he
hesitated
as
if
asking
himself
whether
or
no
he
should
enter
it
gave
a
glance
towards
us
took
a
few
whiffs
at
his
pipe
and
then
resumed
his
walk
at
the
same
nonchalant
pace
rouletabille
and
i
looked
at
our
host
his
flashing
eyes
his
clenched
hands
his
trembling
lips
told
us
of
the
tumultuous
feelings
by
which
he
was
being
agitated
he
has
done
well
not
to
come
in
here
he
hissed
who
is
that
man
asked
rouletabille
returning
to
his
omelette
the
green
man
growled
the
innkeeper
don
t
you
know
him
then
all
the
better
for
you
he
is
not
an
acquaintance
to
well
he
is
monsieur
stangerson
s
you
don
t
appear
to
like
him
very
much
asked
the
reporter
pouring
his
omelette
into
the
nobody
likes
him
monsieur
he
s
an
upstart
who
must
once
have
had
a
fortune
of
his
own
and
he
forgives
nobody
because
in
order
to
live
he
has
been
compelled
to
become
a
servant
a
keeper
is
as
much
a
servant
as
any
other
isn
t
he
upon
my
word
one
would
say
that
he
is
the
master
of
the
glandier
and
that
all
the
land
and
woods
belong
to
him
he
ll
not
let
a
poor
creature
eat
a
morsel
of
bread
on
the
grass
his
grass
does
he
often
come
here
too
often
but
i
ve
made
him
understand
that
his
face
doesn
t
please
me
and
for
a
month
past
he
hasn
t
been
here
the
donjon
inn
has
never
existed
for
him
he
hasn
t
had
time
been
too
much
engaged
in
paying
court
to
the
landlady
of
the
three
lilies
at
a
bad
fellow
there
isn
t
an
honest
man
who
can
bear
him
why
the
concierges
of
the
chateau
would
turn
their
eyes
away
from
a
picture
of
him
the
concierges
of
the
chateau
are
honest
people
then
yes
they
are
as
true
as
my
name
s
mathieu
monsieur
i
believe
them
to
be
yet
they
ve
been
arrested
what
does
that
prove
but
i
don
t
want
to
mix
myself
up
in
other
people
s
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
murder
of
the
murder
of
poor
mademoiselle
stangerson
a
good
girl
much
loved
everywhere
in
the
country
that
s
what
i
think
of
it
and
many
things
besides
but
that
s
nobody
s
not
even
mine
insisted
rouletabille
the
innkeeper
looked
at
him
sideways
and
said
gruffly
not
even
the
omelette
ready
we
sat
down
at
table
and
were
silently
eating
when
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
an
old
woman
dressed
in
rags
leaning
on
a
stick
her
head
doddering
her
white
hair
hanging
loosely
over
her
wrinkled
forehead
appeared
on
the
threshold
ah
there
you
are
mother
angenoux
it
s
long
since
we
saw
you
last
said
our
host
i
have
been
very
ill
very
nearly
dying
said
the
old
woman
if
ever
you
should
have
any
scraps
for
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
and
she
entered
followed
by
a
cat
larger
than
any
i
had
ever
believed
could
exist
the
beast
looked
at
us
and
gave
so
hopeless
a
miau
that
i
shuddered
i
had
never
heard
so
lugubrious
a
cry
as
if
drawn
by
the
cat
s
cry
a
man
followed
the
old
woman
in
it
was
the
green
man
he
saluted
by
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
and
seated
himself
at
a
table
near
to
ours
a
glass
of
cider
daddy
mathieu
he
said
as
the
green
man
entered
daddy
mathieu
had
started
violently
but
visibly
mastering
himself
he
said
i
ve
no
more
cider
i
served
the
last
bottles
to
these
then
give
me
a
glass
of
white
wine
said
the
green
man
without
showing
the
least
surprise
i
ve
no
more
white
wine
no
more
anything
said
daddy
mathieu
surlily
how
is
madame
mathieu
quite
well
thank
so
the
young
woman
with
the
large
tender
eyes
whom
we
had
just
seen
was
the
wife
of
this
repugnant
and
brutal
rustic
whose
jealousy
seemed
to
emphasise
his
physical
ugliness
slamming
the
door
behind
him
the
innkeeper
left
the
room
mother
angenoux
was
still
standing
leaning
on
her
stick
the
cat
at
her
feet
you
ve
been
ill
mother
angenoux
is
that
why
we
have
not
seen
you
for
the
last
week
asked
the
green
man
yes
monsieur
keeper
i
have
been
able
to
get
up
but
three
times
to
go
to
pray
to
our
good
patroness
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
have
been
lying
on
my
bed
there
was
no
one
to
care
for
me
but
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
did
she
not
leave
you
neither
by
day
nor
by
are
you
sure
of
that
as
i
am
of
then
how
was
it
madame
angenoux
that
all
through
the
night
of
the
murder
nothing
but
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
was
heard
mother
angenoux
planted
herself
in
front
of
the
and
struck
the
floor
with
her
stick
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
she
said
but
shall
i
tell
you
something
there
are
no
two
cats
in
the
world
that
cry
like
that
well
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
also
heard
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
outside
and
yet
she
was
on
my
knees
and
did
not
mew
once
i
swear
i
crossed
myself
when
i
heard
that
as
if
i
had
heard
the
i
looked
at
the
keeper
when
he
put
the
last
question
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
i
did
not
detect
an
evil
smile
on
his
lips
at
that
moment
the
noise
of
loud
quarrelling
reached
us
we
even
thought
we
heard
a
dull
sound
of
blows
as
if
some
one
was
being
beaten
the
green
man
quickly
rose
and
hurried
to
the
door
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
but
it
was
opened
by
the
landlord
who
appeared
and
said
to
the
keeper
don
t
alarm
yourself
monsieur
it
is
my
wife
she
has
the
and
he
laughed
here
mother
angenoux
here
are
some
scraps
for
your
he
held
out
a
packet
to
the
old
woman
who
took
it
eagerly
and
went
out
by
the
door
closely
followed
by
her
cat
then
you
won
t
serve
me
asked
the
green
man
daddy
mathieu
s
face
was
placid
and
no
longer
retained
its
expression
of
hatred
i
ve
nothing
for
you
nothing
for
you
take
yourself
the
green
man
quietly
refilled
his
pipe
lit
it
bowed
to
us
and
went
out
no
sooner
was
he
over
the
threshold
than
daddy
mathieu
slammed
the
door
after
him
and
turning
towards
us
with
eyes
bloodshot
and
frothing
at
the
mouth
he
hissed
to
us
shaking
his
clenched
fist
at
the
door
he
had
just
shut
on
the
man
he
evidently
hated
i
don
t
know
who
you
are
who
tell
me
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
meat
now
but
if
it
will
interest
you
to
know
it
that
man
is
the
murderer
with
which
words
daddy
mathieu
immediately
left
us
rouletabille
returned
towards
the
fireplace
and
said
now
we
ll
grill
our
steak
how
do
you
like
the
cider
it
s
a
little
tart
but
i
like
we
saw
no
more
of
daddy
mathieu
that
day
and
absolute
silence
reigned
in
the
inn
when
we
left
it
after
placing
five
francs
on
the
table
in
payment
for
our
feast
rouletabille
at
once
set
off
on
a
three
mile
walk
round
professor
stangerson
s
estate
he
halted
for
some
ten
minutes
at
the
corner
of
a
narrow
road
black
with
soot
near
to
some
huts
in
the
forest
of
which
touches
on
the
road
from
epinay
to
corbeil
to
tell
me
that
the
murderer
had
certainly
passed
that
way
before
entering
the
grounds
and
concealing
himself
in
the
little
clump
of
trees
you
don
t
think
then
that
the
keeper
knows
anything
of
it
i
asked
we
shall
see
that
later
he
replied
for
the
present
i
m
not
interested
in
what
the
landlord
said
about
the
man
the
landlord
hates
him
i
didn
t
take
you
to
breakfast
at
the
donjon
inn
for
the
sake
of
the
green
then
rouletabille
with
great
precaution
glided
followed
by
me
towards
the
little
building
which
standing
near
the
park
gate
served
for
the
home
of
the
concierges
who
had
been
arrested
that
morning
with
the
skill
of
an
acrobat
he
got
into
the
lodge
by
an
upper
window
which
had
been
left
open
and
returned
ten
minutes
later
he
said
only
ah
a
word
which
in
his
mouth
signified
many
things
we
were
about
to
take
the
road
leading
to
the
chateau
when
a
considerable
stir
at
the
park
gate
attracted
our
attention
a
carriage
had
arrived
and
some
people
had
come
from
the
chateau
to
meet
it
rouletabille
pointed
out
to
me
a
gentleman
who
descended
from
it
that
s
the
chief
of
the
surete
he
said
now
we
shall
see
what
frederic
larsan
has
up
his
sleeve
and
whether
he
is
so
much
cleverer
than
anybody
the
carriage
of
the
chief
of
the
surete
was
followed
by
three
other
vehicles
containing
reporters
who
were
also
desirous
of
entering
the
park
but
two
gendarmes
stationed
at
the
gate
had
evidently
received
orders
to
refuse
admission
to
anybody
the
chief
of
the
surete
calmed
their
impatience
by
undertaking
to
furnish
to
the
press
that
evening
all
the
information
he
could
give
that
would
not
interfere
with
the
judicial
inquiry
chapter
xi
in
which
frederic
larsan
explains
how
the
murderer
was
able
to
get
out
of
the
yellow
room
among
the
mass
of
papers
legal
documents
memoirs
and
extracts
from
newspapers
which
i
have
collected
relating
to
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
there
is
one
very
interesting
piece
it
is
a
detail
of
the
famous
examination
which
took
place
that
afternoon
in
the
laboratory
of
professor
stangerson
before
the
chief
of
the
surete
this
narrative
is
from
the
pen
of
monsieur
maleine
the
registrar
who
like
the
examining
magistrate
had
spent
some
of
his
leisure
time
in
the
pursuit
of
literature
the
piece
was
to
have
made
part
of
a
book
which
however
has
never
been
published
and
which
was
to
have
been
entitled
my
it
was
given
to
me
by
the
registrar
himself
some
time
after
the
astonishing
denouement
to
this
case
and
is
unique
in
judicial
chronicles
here
it
is
it
is
not
a
mere
dry
transcription
of
questions
and
answers
because
the
registrar
often
intersperses
his
story
with
his
own
personal
comments
the
registrar
s
narrative
the
examining
magistrate
and
i
the
writer
relates
found
ourselves
in
the
yellow
room
in
the
company
of
the
builder
who
had
constructed
the
pavilion
after
professor
stangerson
s
designs
he
had
a
workman
with
him
monsieur
de
marquet
had
had
the
walls
laid
entirely
bare
that
is
to
say
he
had
had
them
stripped
of
the
paper
which
had
decorated
them
blows
with
a
pick
here
and
there
satisfied
us
of
the
absence
of
any
sort
of
opening
the
floor
and
the
ceiling
were
thoroughly
sounded
we
found
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
be
found
monsieur
de
marquet
appeared
to
be
delighted
and
never
ceased
repeating
what
a
case
what
a
case
we
shall
never
know
you
ll
see
how
the
murderer
was
able
to
get
out
of
this
room
then
suddenly
with
a
radiant
face
he
called
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
gendarmes
go
to
the
chateau
he
said
and
request
monsieur
stangerson
and
monsieur
robert
darzac
to
come
to
me
in
the
laboratory
also
daddy
jacques
and
let
your
men
bring
here
the
two
five
minutes
later
all
were
assembled
in
the
laboratory
the
chief
of
the
surete
who
had
arrived
at
the
glandier
joined
us
at
that
moment
i
was
seated
at
monsieur
stangerson
s
desk
ready
for
work
when
monsieur
de
marquet
made
us
the
following
little
speech
as
original
as
it
was
unexpected
with
your
permission
gentlemen
as
examinations
lead
to
nothing
we
will
for
once
abandon
the
old
system
of
interrogation
i
will
not
have
you
brought
before
me
one
by
one
but
we
will
all
remain
here
as
we
are
monsieur
stangerson
monsieur
robert
darzac
daddy
jacques
and
the
two
concierges
the
chief
of
the
surete
the
registrar
and
myself
we
shall
all
be
on
the
same
footing
the
concierges
may
for
the
moment
forget
that
they
have
been
arrested
we
are
going
to
confer
together
we
are
on
the
spot
where
the
crime
was
committed
we
have
nothing
else
to
discuss
but
the
crime
so
let
us
discuss
it
freely
intelligently
or
otherwise
so
long
as
we
speak
just
what
is
in
our
minds
there
need
be
no
formality
or
method
since
this
won
t
help
us
in
any
then
passing
before
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
what
do
you
think
of
that
eh
what
a
scene
could
you
have
thought
of
that
i
ll
make
a
little
piece
out
of
it
for
the
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
glee
i
turned
my
eyes
on
monsieur
stangerson
the
hope
he
had
received
from
the
doctor
s
latest
reports
which
stated
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
might
recover
from
her
wounds
had
not
been
able
to
efface
from
his
noble
features
the
marks
of
the
great
sorrow
that
was
upon
him
he
had
believed
his
daughter
to
be
dead
and
he
was
still
broken
by
that
belief
his
clear
soft
blue
eyes
expressed
infinite
sorrow
i
had
had
occasion
many
times
to
see
monsieur
stangerson
at
public
ceremonies
and
from
the
first
had
been
struck
by
his
countenance
which
seemed
as
pure
as
that
of
a
child
the
dreamy
gaze
with
the
sublime
and
mystical
expression
of
the
inventor
and
thinker
on
those
occasions
his
daughter
was
always
to
be
seen
either
following
him
or
by
his
side
for
they
never
quitted
each
other
it
was
said
and
had
shared
the
same
labours
for
many
years
the
young
lady
who
was
then
five
and
thirty
though
she
looked
no
more
than
thirty
had
devoted
herself
entirely
to
science
she
still
won
admiration
for
her
imperial
beauty
which
had
remained
intact
without
a
wrinkle
withstanding
time
and
love
who
would
have
dreamed
that
i
should
one
day
be
seated
by
her
pillow
with
my
papers
and
that
i
should
see
her
on
the
point
of
death
painfully
recounting
to
us
the
most
monstrous
and
most
mysterious
crime
i
have
heard
of
in
my
career
who
would
have
thought
that
i
should
be
that
afternoon
listening
to
the
despairing
father
vainly
trying
to
explain
how
his
daughter
s
assailant
had
been
able
to
escape
from
him
why
bury
ourselves
with
our
work
in
obscure
retreats
in
the
depths
of
woods
if
it
may
not
protect
us
against
those
dangerous
threats
to
life
which
meet
us
in
the
busy
cities
now
monsieur
stangerson
said
monsieur
de
marquet
with
somewhat
of
an
important
air
place
yourself
exactly
where
you
were
when
mademoiselle
stangerson
left
you
to
go
to
her
monsieur
stangerson
rose
and
standing
at
a
certain
distance
from
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
said
in
an
even
voice
and
without
the
least
trace
of
emphasis
a
voice
which
i
can
only
describe
as
a
dead
voice
i
was
here
about
eleven
o
clock
after
i
had
made
a
brief
chemical
experiment
at
the
furnaces
of
the
laboratory
needing
all
the
space
behind
me
i
had
my
desk
moved
here
by
daddy
jacques
who
spent
the
evening
in
cleaning
some
of
my
apparatus
my
daughter
had
been
working
at
the
same
desk
with
me
when
it
was
her
time
to
leave
she
rose
kissed
me
and
bade
daddy
jacques
goodnight
she
had
to
pass
behind
my
desk
and
the
door
to
enter
her
chamber
and
she
could
do
this
only
with
some
difficulty
that
is
to
say
i
was
very
near
the
place
where
the
crime
occurred
and
the
desk
i
asked
obeying
in
thus
mixing
myself
in
the
conversation
the
express
orders
of
my
chief
as
soon
as
you
heard
the
cry
of
murder
followed
by
the
revolver
shots
what
became
of
the
desk
daddy
jacques
answered
we
pushed
it
back
against
the
wall
here
close
to
where
it
is
at
the
present
moment
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
at
the
door
at
i
followed
up
my
reasoning
to
which
however
i
attached
but
little
importance
regarding
it
as
only
a
weak
hypothesis
with
another
question
might
not
a
man
in
the
room
the
desk
being
so
near
to
the
door
by
stooping
and
slipping
under
the
desk
have
left
it
unobserved
you
are
forgetting
interrupted
monsieur
stangerson
wearily
that
my
daughter
had
locked
and
bolted
her
door
that
the
door
had
remained
fastened
that
we
vainly
tried
to
force
it
open
when
we
heard
the
noise
and
that
we
were
at
the
door
while
the
struggle
between
the
murderer
and
my
poor
child
was
going
on
immediately
after
we
heard
her
stifled
cries
as
she
was
being
held
by
the
fingers
that
have
left
their
red
mark
upon
her
throat
rapid
as
the
attack
was
we
were
no
less
rapid
in
our
endeavors
to
get
into
the
room
where
the
tragedy
was
taking
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
once
more
examined
the
door
with
the
greatest
care
then
i
returned
to
my
place
with
a
despairing
gesture
if
the
lower
panel
of
the
door
i
said
could
be
removed
without
the
whole
door
being
necessarily
opened
the
problem
would
be
solved
but
unfortunately
that
last
hypothesis
is
untenable
after
an
examination
of
the
door
it
s
of
oak
solid
and
massive
you
can
see
that
quite
plainly
in
spite
of
the
injury
done
in
the
attempt
to
burst
it
ah
cried
daddy
jacques
it
is
an
old
and
solid
door
that
was
brought
from
the
chateau
they
don
t
make
such
doors
now
we
had
to
use
this
bar
of
iron
to
get
it
open
all
four
of
us
for
the
concierge
brave
woman
she
is
helped
us
it
pains
me
to
find
them
both
in
prison
daddy
jacques
had
no
sooner
uttered
these
words
of
pity
and
protestation
than
tears
and
lamentations
broke
out
from
the
concierges
i
never
saw
two
accused
people
crying
more
bitterly
i
was
extremely
disgusted
even
if
they
were
innocent
i
could
not
understand
how
they
could
behave
like
that
in
the
face
of
misfortune
a
dignified
bearing
at
such
times
is
better
than
tears
and
groans
which
most
often
are
feigned
now
then
enough
of
that
sniveling
cried
monsieur
de
marquet
and
in
your
interest
tell
us
what
you
were
doing
under
the
windows
of
the
pavilion
at
the
time
your
mistress
was
being
attacked
for
you
were
close
to
the
pavilion
when
daddy
jacques
met
we
were
coming
to
help
they
whined
if
we
could
only
lay
hands
on
the
murderer
he
d
never
taste
bread
again
the
woman
gurgled
between
her
sobs
as
before
we
were
unable
to
get
two
connecting
thoughts
out
of
them
they
persisted
in
their
denials
and
swore
by
heaven
and
all
the
saints
that
they
were
in
bed
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
revolver
shot
it
was
not
one
but
two
shots
that
were
fired
you
see
you
are
lying
if
you
had
heard
one
you
would
have
heard
the
mon
dieu
monsieur
it
was
the
second
shot
we
heard
we
were
asleep
when
the
first
shot
was
two
shots
were
fired
said
daddy
jacques
i
am
certain
that
all
the
cartridges
were
in
my
revolver
we
found
afterward
that
two
had
been
exploded
and
we
heard
two
shots
behind
the
door
was
not
that
so
monsieur
stangerson
yes
replied
the
professor
there
were
two
shots
one
dull
and
the
other
sharp
and
why
do
you
persist
in
lying
cried
monsieur
de
marquet
turning
to
the
concierges
do
you
think
the
police
are
the
fools
you
are
everything
points
to
the
fact
that
you
were
out
of
doors
and
near
the
pavilion
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
what
were
you
doing
there
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
said
turning
to
monsieur
stangerson
i
can
only
explain
the
escape
of
the
murderer
on
the
assumption
of
help
from
these
two
accomplices
as
soon
as
the
door
was
forced
open
and
while
you
monsieur
stangerson
were
occupied
with
your
unfortunate
child
the
concierge
and
his
wife
facilitated
the
flight
of
the
murderer
who
screening
himself
behind
them
reached
the
window
in
the
vestibule
and
sprang
out
of
it
into
the
park
the
concierge
closed
the
window
after
him
and
fastened
the
blinds
which
certainly
could
not
have
closed
and
fastened
of
themselves
that
is
the
conclusion
i
have
arrived
at
if
anyone
here
has
any
other
idea
let
him
state
monsieur
stangerson
intervened
what
you
say
was
impossible
i
do
not
believe
either
in
the
guilt
or
in
the
connivance
of
my
concierges
though
i
can
not
understand
what
they
were
doing
in
the
park
at
that
late
hour
of
the
night
i
say
it
was
impossible
because
madame
bernier
held
the
lamp
and
did
not
move
from
the
threshold
of
the
room
because
i
as
soon
as
the
door
was
forced
open
threw
myself
on
my
knees
beside
my
daughter
and
no
one
could
have
left
or
entered
the
room
by
the
door
without
passing
over
her
body
and
forcing
his
way
by
me
daddy
jacques
and
the
concierge
had
but
to
cast
a
glance
round
the
chamber
and
under
the
bed
as
i
had
done
on
entering
to
see
that
there
was
nobody
in
it
but
my
daughter
lying
on
the
what
do
you
think
monsieur
darzac
asked
the
magistrate
monsieur
darzac
replied
that
he
had
no
opinion
to
express
monsieur
dax
the
chief
of
the
surete
who
so
far
had
been
listening
and
examining
the
room
at
length
deigned
to
open
his
lips
while
search
is
being
made
for
the
criminal
we
had
better
try
to
find
out
the
motive
for
the
crime
that
will
advance
us
a
little
he
said
turning
towards
monsieur
stangerson
he
continued
in
the
even
intelligent
tone
indicative
of
a
strong
character
i
understand
that
mademoiselle
was
shortly
to
have
been
married
the
professor
looked
sadly
at
monsieur
robert
darzac
to
my
friend
here
whom
i
should
have
been
happy
to
call
my
son
to
monsieur
robert
mademoiselle
stangerson
is
much
better
and
is
rapidly
recovering
from
her
wounds
the
marriage
is
simply
delayed
is
it
not
monsieur
insisted
the
chief
of
the
surete
i
hope
so
what
is
there
any
doubt
about
that
monsieur
stangerson
did
not
answer
monsieur
robert
darzac
seemed
agitated
i
saw
that
his
hand
trembled
as
it
fingered
his
watchchain
monsieur
dax
coughed
as
did
monsieur
de
marquet
both
were
evidently
embarrassed
you
understand
monsieur
stangerson
he
said
that
in
an
affair
so
perplexing
as
this
we
can
not
neglect
anything
we
must
know
all
even
the
smallest
and
seemingly
most
futile
thing
concerning
the
victim
information
apparently
the
most
insignificant
why
do
you
doubt
that
this
marriage
will
take
place
you
expressed
a
hope
but
the
hope
implies
a
doubt
why
do
you
doubt
monsieur
stangerson
made
a
visible
effort
to
recover
himself
yes
monsieur
he
said
at
length
you
are
right
it
will
be
best
that
you
should
know
something
which
if
i
concealed
it
might
appear
to
be
of
importance
monsieur
darzac
agrees
with
me
in
monsieur
darzac
whose
pallor
at
that
moment
seemed
to
me
to
be
altogether
abnormal
made
a
sign
of
assent
i
gathered
he
was
unable
to
speak
i
want
you
to
know
then
continued
monsieur
stangerson
that
my
daughter
has
sworn
never
to
leave
me
and
adheres
firmly
to
her
oath
in
spite
of
all
my
prayers
and
all
that
i
have
argued
to
induce
her
to
marry
we
have
known
monsieur
robert
darzac
many
years
he
loves
my
child
and
i
believed
that
she
loved
him
because
she
only
recently
consented
to
this
marriage
which
i
desire
with
all
my
heart
i
am
an
old
man
monsieur
and
it
was
a
happy
hour
to
me
when
i
knew
that
after
i
had
gone
she
would
have
at
her
side
one
who
loved
her
and
who
would
help
her
in
continuing
our
common
labours
i
love
and
esteem
monsieur
darzac
both
for
his
greatness
of
heart
and
for
his
devotion
to
science
but
two
days
before
the
tragedy
for
i
know
not
what
reason
my
daughter
declared
to
me
that
she
would
never
marry
monsieur
a
dead
silence
followed
monsieur
stangerson
s
words
it
was
a
moment
fraught
with
suspense
did
mademoiselle
give
you
any
explanation
did
she
tell
you
what
her
motive
was
asked
monsieur
dax
she
told
me
she
was
too
old
to
marry
that
she
had
waited
too
long
she
said
she
had
given
much
thought
to
the
matter
and
while
she
had
a
great
esteem
even
affection
for
monsieur
darzac
she
felt
it
would
be
better
if
things
remained
as
they
were
she
would
be
happy
she
said
to
see
the
relations
between
ourselves
and
monsieur
darzac
become
closer
but
only
on
the
understanding
that
there
would
be
no
more
talk
of
that
is
very
strange
muttered
monsieur
dax
strange
repeated
monsieur
de
marquet
you
ll
certainly
not
find
the
motive
there
monsieur
dax
monsieur
stangerson
said
with
a
cold
smile
in
any
case
the
motive
was
not
theft
said
the
chief
impatiently
oh
we
are
quite
convinced
of
that
cried
the
examining
magistrate
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
laboratory
opened
and
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
gendarmes
entered
and
handed
a
card
to
the
examining
magistrate
monsieur
de
marquet
read
it
and
uttered
a
half
angry
exclamation
this
is
really
too
much
he
cried
what
is
it
asked
the
chief
it
s
the
card
of
a
young
reporter
engaged
on
the
epoque
a
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
it
has
these
words
written
on
it
one
of
the
motives
of
the
crime
was
the
chief
smiled
ah
young
rouletabille
i
ve
heard
of
him
he
is
considered
rather
clever
let
him
come
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
was
allowed
to
enter
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
in
the
train
that
morning
on
the
way
to
he
had
introduced
himself
almost
against
my
wish
into
our
compartment
i
had
better
say
at
once
that
his
manners
and
the
arrogance
with
which
he
assumed
to
know
what
was
incomprehensible
even
to
us
impressed
him
unfavourably
on
my
mind
i
do
not
like
journalists
they
are
a
class
of
writers
to
be
avoided
as
the
pest
they
think
that
everything
is
permissible
and
they
respect
nothing
grant
them
the
least
favour
allow
them
even
to
approach
you
and
you
never
can
tell
what
annoyance
they
may
give
you
this
one
appears
to
be
scarcely
twenty
years
old
and
the
effrontery
with
which
he
dared
to
question
us
and
discuss
the
matter
with
us
made
him
particularly
obnoxious
to
me
besides
he
had
a
way
of
expressing
himself
that
left
us
guessing
as
to
whether
he
was
mocking
us
or
not
i
know
quite
well
that
the
epoque
is
an
influential
paper
with
which
it
is
well
to
be
on
good
terms
but
the
paper
ought
not
to
allow
itself
to
be
represented
by
sneaking
reporters
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
entered
the
laboratory
bowed
to
us
and
waited
for
monsieur
de
marquet
to
ask
him
to
explain
his
presence
you
pretend
monsieur
that
you
know
the
motive
for
the
crime
and
that
that
motive
in
the
face
of
all
the
evidence
that
has
been
forthcoming
was
robbery
no
monsieur
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
do
not
say
that
robbery
was
the
motive
for
the
crime
and
i
don
t
believe
it
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
card
it
means
that
robbery
was
one
of
the
motives
for
the
what
leads
you
to
think
that
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
accompany
me
i
will
show
the
young
man
asked
us
to
follow
him
into
the
vestibule
and
we
did
he
led
us
towards
the
lavatory
and
begged
monsieur
de
marquet
to
kneel
beside
him
this
lavatory
is
lit
by
the
glass
door
and
when
the
door
was
open
the
light
which
penetrated
was
sufficient
to
light
it
perfectly
monsieur
de
marquet
and
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
knelt
down
on
the
threshold
and
the
young
man
pointed
to
a
spot
on
the
pavement
the
stones
of
the
lavatory
have
not
been
washed
by
daddy
jacques
for
some
time
he
said
that
can
be
seen
by
the
layer
of
dust
that
covers
them
now
notice
here
the
marks
of
two
large
footprints
and
the
black
ash
they
left
where
they
have
been
that
ash
is
nothing
else
than
the
charcoal
dust
that
covers
the
path
along
which
you
must
pass
through
the
forest
in
order
to
get
directly
from
epinay
to
the
glandier
you
know
there
is
a
little
village
of
at
that
place
who
make
large
quantities
of
charcoal
what
the
murderer
did
was
to
come
here
at
midday
when
there
was
nobody
at
the
pavilion
and
attempt
his
but
what
robbery
where
do
you
see
any
signs
of
robbery
what
proves
to
you
that
a
robbery
has
been
committed
we
all
cried
at
once
what
put
me
on
the
trace
of
it
continued
the
journalist
was
this
interrupted
monsieur
de
marquet
still
on
his
knees
evidently
said
rouletabille
and
monsieur
de
marquet
explained
that
there
were
on
the
dust
of
the
pavement
marks
of
two
footsteps
as
well
as
the
impression
of
a
heavy
rectangular
parcel
the
marks
of
the
cord
with
which
it
had
been
fastened
being
easily
distinguished
you
have
been
here
then
monsieur
rouletabille
i
thought
i
had
given
orders
to
daddy
jacques
who
was
left
in
charge
of
the
pavilion
not
to
allow
anybody
to
don
t
scold
daddy
jacques
i
came
here
with
monsieur
robert
ah
indeed
exclaimed
monsieur
de
marquet
disagreeably
casting
a
at
monsieur
darzac
who
remained
perfectly
silent
when
i
saw
the
mark
of
the
parcel
by
the
side
of
the
footprints
i
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
robbery
replied
monsieur
rouletabille
the
thief
had
not
brought
a
parcel
with
him
he
had
made
one
here
a
parcel
with
the
stolen
objects
no
doubt
and
he
put
it
in
this
corner
intending
to
take
it
away
when
the
moment
came
for
him
to
make
his
escape
he
had
also
placed
his
heavy
boots
beside
the
parcel
for
see
there
are
no
marks
of
steps
leading
to
the
marks
left
by
the
boots
which
were
placed
side
by
side
that
accounts
for
the
fact
that
the
murderer
left
no
trace
of
his
steps
when
he
fled
from
the
yellow
room
nor
any
in
the
laboratory
nor
in
the
vestibule
after
entering
the
yellow
room
in
his
boots
he
took
them
off
finding
them
troublesome
or
because
he
wished
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
the
marks
made
by
him
in
going
through
the
vestibule
and
the
laboratory
were
subsequently
washed
out
by
daddy
jacques
having
for
some
reason
or
other
taken
off
his
boots
the
murderer
carried
them
in
his
hand
and
placed
them
by
the
side
of
the
parcel
he
had
made
by
that
time
the
robbery
had
been
accomplished
the
man
then
returned
to
the
yellow
room
and
slipped
under
the
bed
where
the
mark
of
his
body
is
perfectly
visible
on
the
floor
and
even
on
the
mat
which
has
been
slightly
moved
from
its
place
and
creased
fragments
of
straw
also
recently
torn
bear
witness
to
the
murderer
s
movements
under
the
yes
yes
we
know
all
about
that
said
monsieur
de
marquet
the
robber
had
another
motive
for
returning
to
hide
under
the
bed
continued
the
astonishing
you
might
think
that
he
was
trying
to
hide
himself
quickly
on
seeing
through
the
vestibule
window
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
about
to
enter
the
pavilion
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
him
to
have
climbed
up
to
the
attic
and
hidden
there
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
get
away
if
his
purpose
had
been
only
no
no
he
had
to
be
in
the
yellow
room
here
the
chief
intervened
that
s
not
at
all
bad
young
man
i
compliment
you
if
we
do
not
know
yet
how
the
murderer
succeeded
in
getting
away
we
can
at
any
rate
see
how
he
came
in
and
committed
the
robbery
but
what
did
he
steal
something
very
valuable
replied
the
young
reporter
at
that
moment
we
heard
a
cry
from
the
laboratory
we
rushed
in
and
found
monsieur
stangerson
his
eyes
haggard
his
limbs
trembling
pointing
to
a
sort
of
bookcase
which
he
had
opened
and
which
we
saw
was
empty
at
the
same
instant
he
sank
into
the
large
armchair
that
was
placed
before
the
desk
and
groaned
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
i
have
been
robbed
again
for
god
s
sake
do
not
say
a
word
of
this
to
my
daughter
she
would
be
more
pained
than
i
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
added
in
a
tone
i
shall
never
forget
after
all
what
does
it
matter
so
long
as
she
lives
she
will
live
said
monsieur
darzac
in
a
voice
strangely
touching
and
we
will
find
the
stolen
articles
said
monsieur
dax
but
what
was
in
the
cabinet
twenty
years
of
my
life
replied
the
illustrious
professor
sadly
or
rather
of
our
lives
the
lives
of
myself
and
my
daughter
yes
our
most
precious
documents
the
records
of
our
secret
experiments
and
our
labours
of
twenty
years
were
in
that
cabinet
it
is
an
irreparable
loss
to
us
and
i
venture
to
say
to
science
all
the
processes
by
which
i
had
been
able
to
arrive
at
the
precious
proof
of
the
destructibility
of
matter
were
there
all
the
man
who
came
wished
to
take
all
from
me
my
daughter
and
my
work
my
heart
and
my
and
the
great
scientist
wept
like
a
child
we
stood
around
him
in
silence
deeply
affected
by
his
great
distress
monsieur
darzac
pressed
closely
to
his
side
and
tried
in
vain
to
restrain
his
tears
a
sight
which
for
the
moment
almost
made
me
like
him
in
spite
of
an
instinctive
repulsion
which
his
strange
demeanour
and
his
inexplicable
anxiety
had
inspired
me
monsieur
rouletabille
alone
as
if
his
precious
time
and
mission
on
earth
did
not
permit
him
to
dwell
in
the
contemplation
on
human
suffering
had
very
calmly
stepped
up
to
the
empty
cabinet
and
pointing
at
it
broke
the
almost
solemn
silence
he
entered
into
explanations
for
which
there
was
no
need
as
to
why
he
had
been
led
to
believe
that
a
robbery
had
been
committed
which
included
the
simultaneous
discovery
he
had
made
in
the
lavatory
and
the
empty
precious
cabinet
in
the
laboratory
the
first
thing
that
had
struck
him
he
said
was
the
unusual
form
of
that
piece
of
furniture
it
was
very
strongly
built
of
iron
clearly
showing
that
it
was
intended
for
the
keeping
of
most
valuable
objects
then
he
noticed
that
the
key
had
been
left
in
the
lock
one
does
not
ordinarily
have
a
safe
and
leave
it
open
he
had
said
to
himself
this
little
key
with
its
brass
head
and
complicated
wards
had
strongly
attracted
him
its
presence
had
suggested
robbery
monsieur
de
marquet
appeared
to
be
greatly
perplexed
as
if
he
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
be
glad
of
the
new
direction
given
to
the
inquiry
by
the
young
reporter
or
sorry
that
it
had
not
been
done
by
himself
in
our
profession
and
for
the
general
welfare
we
have
to
put
up
with
such
mortifications
and
bury
selfish
feelings
that
was
why
monsieur
de
marquet
controlled
himself
and
joined
his
compliments
with
those
of
monsieur
dax
as
for
monsieur
rouletabille
he
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
there
s
nothing
at
all
in
that
i
should
have
liked
to
box
his
ears
especially
when
he
added
you
will
do
well
monsieur
to
ask
monsieur
stangerson
who
usually
kept
that
key
my
daughter
replied
monsieur
stangerson
she
was
never
without
it
ah
then
that
changes
the
aspect
of
things
which
no
longer
corresponds
with
monsieur
rouletabille
s
ideas
cried
monsieur
de
marquet
if
that
key
never
left
mademoiselle
stangerson
the
murderer
must
have
waited
for
her
in
her
room
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
it
and
the
robbery
could
not
have
been
committed
until
after
the
attack
had
been
made
on
her
but
after
the
attack
four
persons
were
in
the
laboratory
i
can
t
make
it
out
the
robbery
said
the
reporter
could
only
have
been
committed
before
the
attack
upon
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
her
room
when
the
murderer
entered
the
pavilion
he
already
possessed
the
that
is
impossible
said
monsieur
stangerson
in
a
low
voice
it
is
quite
possible
monsieur
as
this
and
the
young
rascal
drew
a
copy
of
the
epoque
from
his
pocket
dated
the
of
october
i
recall
the
fact
that
the
crime
was
committed
on
the
night
between
the
and
and
showing
us
an
advertisement
he
read
yesterday
a
black
satin
reticule
was
lost
in
the
grands
magasins
de
la
louvre
it
contained
amongst
other
things
a
small
key
with
a
brass
head
a
handsome
reward
will
be
given
to
the
person
who
has
found
it
this
person
must
write
poste
restante
bureau
to
this
address
do
not
these
letters
suggest
mademoiselle
stangerson
continued
the
reporter
the
key
with
a
brass
head
is
not
this
the
key
i
always
read
advertisements
in
my
business
as
in
yours
monsieur
one
should
always
read
the
they
are
often
the
keys
to
intrigues
that
are
not
always
but
which
are
none
the
less
interesting
this
advertisement
interested
me
specially
the
woman
of
the
key
surrounded
it
with
a
kind
of
mystery
evidently
she
valued
the
key
since
she
promised
a
big
reward
for
its
restoration
and
i
thought
on
these
six
letters
the
first
four
at
once
pointed
to
a
christian
name
evidently
i
said
math
is
mathilde
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
the
two
last
letters
so
i
threw
the
journal
aside
and
occupied
myself
with
other
matters
four
days
later
when
the
evening
paper
appeared
with
enormous
announcing
the
murder
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
the
letters
in
the
advertisement
mechanically
recurred
to
me
i
had
forgotten
the
two
last
letters
when
i
saw
them
again
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
stangerson
i
jumped
into
a
cab
and
rushed
into
the
bureau
no
asking
have
you
a
letter
addressed
to
the
clerk
replied
that
he
had
not
i
insisted
begged
and
entreated
him
to
search
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
were
playing
a
joke
on
him
and
then
told
me
that
he
had
had
a
letter
with
the
initials
n
but
he
had
given
it
up
three
days
ago
to
a
lady
who
came
for
it
you
come
to
claim
the
letter
and
the
day
before
yesterday
another
gentleman
claimed
it
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
he
concluded
angrily
i
tried
to
question
him
as
to
the
two
persons
who
had
already
claimed
the
letter
but
whether
he
wished
to
entrench
himself
behind
professional
secrecy
he
may
have
thought
that
he
had
already
said
too
much
or
whether
he
was
disgusted
at
the
joke
that
had
been
played
on
him
he
would
not
answer
any
of
my
rouletabille
paused
we
all
remained
silent
each
drew
his
own
conclusions
from
the
strange
story
of
the
poste
restante
letter
it
seemed
indeed
that
we
now
had
a
thread
by
means
of
which
we
should
be
able
to
follow
up
this
extraordinary
mystery
then
it
is
almost
certain
said
monsieur
stangerson
that
my
daughter
did
lose
the
key
and
that
she
did
not
tell
me
of
it
wishing
to
spare
any
anxiety
and
that
she
begged
whoever
had
found
it
to
write
to
the
poste
restante
she
evidently
feared
that
by
giving
our
address
inquiries
would
have
resulted
that
would
have
apprised
me
of
the
loss
of
the
key
it
was
quite
logical
quite
natural
for
her
to
have
taken
that
course
for
i
have
been
robbed
once
where
was
that
and
when
asked
the
chief
of
the
surete
oh
many
years
ago
in
america
in
philadelphia
there
were
stolen
from
my
laboratory
the
drawings
of
two
inventions
that
might
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
man
not
only
have
i
never
learnt
who
the
thief
was
but
i
have
never
heard
even
a
word
of
the
object
of
the
robbery
doubtless
because
in
order
to
defeat
the
plans
of
the
person
who
had
robbed
me
i
myself
brought
these
two
inventions
before
the
public
and
so
rendered
the
robbery
of
no
avail
from
that
time
on
i
have
been
very
careful
to
shut
myself
in
when
i
am
at
work
the
bars
to
these
windows
the
lonely
situation
of
this
pavilion
this
cabinet
which
i
had
specially
constructed
this
special
lock
this
unique
key
all
are
precautions
against
fears
inspired
by
a
sad
most
interesting
remarked
monsieur
dax
monsieur
rouletabille
asked
about
the
reticule
neither
monsieur
stangerson
nor
daddy
jacques
had
seen
it
for
several
days
but
a
few
hours
later
we
learned
from
mademoiselle
stangerson
herself
that
the
reticule
had
either
been
stolen
from
her
or
she
had
lost
it
she
further
corroborated
all
that
had
passed
just
as
her
father
had
stated
she
had
gone
to
the
poste
restante
and
on
the
of
october
had
received
a
letter
which
she
affirmed
contained
nothing
but
a
vulgar
pleasantry
which
she
had
immediately
burned
to
return
to
our
examination
or
rather
to
our
conversation
i
must
state
that
the
chief
of
the
surete
having
inquired
of
monsieur
stangerson
under
what
conditions
his
daughter
had
gone
to
paris
on
the
of
october
we
learned
that
monsieur
robert
darzac
had
accompanied
her
and
darzac
had
not
been
again
seen
at
the
chateau
from
that
time
to
the
day
after
the
crime
had
been
committed
the
fact
that
monsieur
darzac
was
with
her
in
the
grands
magasins
de
la
louvre
when
the
reticule
disappeared
could
not
pass
unnoticed
and
it
must
be
said
strongly
awakened
our
interest
this
conversation
between
magistrates
accused
victim
witnesses
and
journalist
was
coming
to
a
close
when
quite
a
theatrical
sensation
an
incident
of
a
kind
displeasing
to
monsieur
de
marquet
was
produced
the
officer
of
the
gendarmes
came
to
announce
that
frederic
larsan
requested
to
be
admitted
a
request
that
was
at
once
complied
with
he
held
in
his
hand
a
heavy
pair
of
muddy
boots
which
he
threw
on
the
pavement
of
the
laboratory
here
he
said
are
the
boots
worn
by
the
murderer
do
you
recognise
them
daddy
jacques
daddy
jacques
bent
over
them
and
stupefied
recognised
a
pair
of
old
boots
which
he
had
some
time
back
thrown
into
a
corner
of
his
attic
he
was
so
taken
aback
that
he
could
not
hide
his
agitation
then
pointing
to
the
handkerchief
in
the
old
man
s
hand
frederic
larsan
said
that
s
a
handkerchief
astonishingly
like
the
one
found
in
the
yellow
i
know
said
daddy
jacques
trembling
they
are
almost
and
then
continued
frederic
larsan
the
old
basque
cap
also
found
in
the
yellow
room
might
at
one
time
have
been
worn
by
daddy
jacques
himself
all
this
gentlemen
proves
i
think
that
the
murderer
wished
to
disguise
his
real
personality
he
did
it
in
a
very
clumsy
way
or
at
least
so
it
appears
to
us
don
t
be
alarmed
daddy
jacques
we
are
quite
sure
that
you
were
not
the
murderer
you
never
left
the
side
of
monsieur
stangerson
but
if
monsieur
stangerson
had
not
been
working
that
night
and
had
gone
back
to
the
chateau
after
parting
with
his
daughter
and
daddy
jacques
had
gone
to
sleep
in
his
attic
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
he
was
the
murderer
he
owes
his
safety
therefore
to
the
tragedy
having
been
enacted
too
soon
the
murderer
no
doubt
from
the
silence
in
the
laboratory
imagined
that
it
was
empty
and
that
the
moment
for
action
had
come
the
man
who
had
been
able
to
introduce
himself
here
so
mysteriously
and
to
leave
so
many
evidences
against
daddy
jacques
was
there
can
be
no
doubt
familiar
with
the
house
at
what
hour
exactly
he
entered
whether
in
the
afternoon
or
in
the
evening
i
can
not
say
one
familiar
with
the
proceedings
and
persons
of
this
pavilion
could
choose
his
own
time
for
entering
the
yellow
room
he
could
not
have
entered
it
if
anybody
had
been
in
the
laboratory
said
monsieur
de
marquet
how
do
we
know
that
replied
larsan
there
was
the
dinner
in
the
laboratory
the
coming
and
going
of
the
servants
in
attendance
there
was
a
chemical
experiment
being
carried
on
between
ten
and
eleven
o
clock
with
monsieur
stangerson
his
daughter
and
daddy
jacques
engaged
at
the
furnace
in
a
corner
of
the
high
chimney
who
can
say
that
the
murderer
an
intimate
a
friend
did
not
take
advantage
of
that
moment
to
slip
into
the
yellow
room
after
having
taken
off
his
boots
in
the
lavatory
it
is
very
improbable
said
monsieur
stangerson
doubtless
but
it
is
not
impossible
i
assert
nothing
as
to
the
escape
from
the
pavilion
that
s
another
thing
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
for
a
moment
frederic
larsan
paused
a
moment
that
appeared
to
us
a
very
long
time
the
eagerness
with
which
we
awaited
what
he
was
going
to
tell
us
may
be
imagined
i
have
not
been
in
the
yellow
room
he
continued
but
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
satisfied
yourselves
that
he
could
have
left
the
room
only
by
way
of
the
door
it
is
by
the
door
then
that
the
murderer
made
his
way
out
at
what
time
at
the
moment
when
it
was
most
easy
for
him
to
do
so
at
the
moment
when
it
became
most
explainable
so
completely
explainable
that
there
can
be
no
other
explanation
let
us
go
over
the
moments
which
followed
after
the
crime
had
been
committed
there
was
the
first
moment
when
monsieur
stangerson
and
daddy
jacques
were
close
to
the
door
ready
to
bar
the
way
there
was
the
second
moment
during
which
daddy
jacques
was
absent
and
monsieur
stangerson
was
left
alone
before
the
door
there
was
a
third
moment
when
monsieur
stangerson
was
joined
by
the
concierge
there
was
a
fourth
moment
during
which
monsieur
stangerson
the
concierge
and
his
wife
and
daddy
jacques
were
before
the
door
there
was
a
fifth
moment
during
which
the
door
was
burst
open
and
the
yellow
room
entered
the
moment
at
which
the
flight
is
explainable
is
the
very
moment
when
there
was
the
least
number
of
persons
before
the
door
there
was
one
moment
when
there
was
but
one
person
monsieur
stangerson
unless
a
complicity
of
silence
on
the
part
of
daddy
jacques
is
admitted
in
which
i
do
not
believe
the
door
was
opened
in
the
presence
of
monsieur
stangerson
alone
and
the
man
escaped
here
we
must
admit
that
monsieur
stangerson
had
powerful
reasons
for
not
arresting
or
not
causing
the
arrest
of
the
murderer
since
he
allowed
him
to
reach
the
window
in
the
vestibule
and
closed
it
after
him
that
done
mademoiselle
stangerson
though
horribly
wounded
had
still
strength
enough
and
no
doubt
in
obedience
to
the
entreaties
of
her
father
to
refasten
the
door
of
her
chamber
with
both
the
bolt
and
the
lock
before
sinking
on
the
floor
we
do
not
know
who
committed
the
crime
we
do
not
know
of
what
wretch
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
are
the
victims
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
both
know
the
secret
must
be
a
terrible
one
for
the
father
had
not
hesitated
to
leave
his
daughter
to
die
behind
a
door
which
she
had
shut
upon
herself
terrible
for
him
to
have
allowed
the
assassin
to
escape
for
there
is
no
other
way
in
the
world
to
explain
the
murderer
s
flight
from
the
yellow
room
the
silence
which
followed
this
dramatic
and
lucid
explanation
was
appalling
we
all
of
us
felt
grieved
for
the
illustrious
professor
driven
into
a
corner
by
the
pitiless
logic
of
frederic
larsan
forced
to
confess
the
whole
truth
of
his
martyrdom
or
to
keep
silent
and
thus
make
a
yet
more
terrible
admission
the
man
himself
a
veritable
statue
of
sorrow
raised
his
hand
with
a
gesture
so
solemn
that
we
bowed
our
heads
to
it
as
before
something
sacred
he
then
pronounced
these
words
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
it
seemed
to
exhaust
him
i
swear
by
the
head
of
my
suffering
child
that
i
never
for
an
instant
left
the
door
of
her
chamber
after
hearing
her
cries
for
help
that
that
door
was
not
opened
while
i
was
alone
in
the
laboratory
and
that
finally
when
we
entered
the
yellow
room
my
three
domestics
and
i
the
murderer
was
no
longer
there
i
swear
i
do
not
know
the
murderer
must
i
say
it
in
spite
of
the
solemnity
of
monsieur
stangerson
s
words
we
did
not
believe
in
his
denial
frederic
larsan
had
shown
us
the
truth
and
it
was
not
so
easily
given
up
monsieur
de
marquet
announced
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
and
as
we
were
about
to
leave
the
laboratory
joseph
rouletabille
approached
monsieur
stangerson
took
him
by
the
hand
with
the
greatest
respect
and
i
heard
him
say
i
believe
you
i
here
close
the
citation
which
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
make
from
monsieur
maleine
s
narrative
i
need
not
tell
the
reader
that
all
that
passed
in
the
laboratory
was
immediately
and
faithfully
reported
to
me
by
rouletabille
chapter
xii
frederic
larsan
s
cane
it
was
not
till
six
o
clock
that
i
left
the
chateau
taking
with
me
the
article
hastily
written
by
my
friend
in
the
little
which
monsieur
robert
darzac
had
placed
at
our
disposal
the
reporter
was
to
sleep
at
the
chateau
taking
advantage
of
the
to
me
inexplicable
hospitality
offered
him
by
monsieur
robert
darzac
to
whom
monsieur
stangerson
in
that
sad
time
left
the
care
of
all
his
domestic
affairs
nevertheless
he
insisted
on
accompanying
me
to
the
station
at
epinay
in
crossing
the
park
he
said
to
me
frederic
is
really
very
clever
and
has
not
belied
his
reputation
do
you
know
how
he
came
to
find
daddy
jacques
s
boots
near
the
spot
where
we
noticed
the
traces
of
the
neat
boots
and
the
disappearance
of
the
rough
ones
there
was
a
square
hole
freshly
made
in
the
moist
ground
where
a
stone
had
evidently
been
removed
larsan
searched
for
that
stone
without
finding
it
and
at
once
imagined
that
it
had
been
used
by
the
murderer
with
which
to
sink
the
boots
in
the
lake
fred
s
calculation
was
an
excellent
one
as
the
success
of
his
search
proves
that
escaped
me
but
my
mind
was
turned
in
another
direction
by
the
large
number
of
false
indications
of
his
track
which
the
murderer
left
and
by
the
measure
of
the
black
corresponding
with
that
of
daddy
jacques
s
boots
which
i
had
established
without
his
suspecting
it
on
the
floor
of
the
yellow
room
all
which
was
a
proof
in
my
eyes
that
the
murderer
had
sought
to
turn
suspicion
on
to
the
old
servant
up
to
that
point
larsan
and
i
are
in
accord
but
no
further
it
is
going
to
be
a
terrible
matter
for
i
tell
you
he
is
working
on
wrong
lines
and
i
i
must
fight
him
with
nothing
i
was
surprised
at
the
profoundly
grave
accent
with
which
my
young
friend
pronounced
the
last
words
he
repeated
yes
terrible
terrible
for
it
is
fighting
with
nothing
when
you
have
only
an
idea
to
fight
at
that
moment
we
passed
by
the
back
of
the
chateau
night
had
come
a
window
on
the
first
floor
was
partly
open
a
feeble
light
came
from
it
as
well
as
some
sounds
which
drew
our
attention
we
approached
until
we
had
reached
the
side
of
a
door
that
was
situated
just
under
the
window
rouletabille
in
a
low
tone
made
me
understand
that
this
was
the
window
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
the
sounds
which
had
attracted
our
attention
ceased
then
were
renewed
for
a
moment
and
then
we
heard
stifled
sobs
we
were
only
able
to
catch
these
words
which
reached
us
distinctly
my
poor
robert
rouletabille
whispered
in
my
ear
if
we
only
knew
what
was
being
said
in
that
chamber
my
inquiry
would
soon
be
he
looked
about
him
the
darkness
of
the
evening
enveloped
us
we
could
not
see
much
beyond
the
narrow
path
bordered
by
trees
which
ran
behind
the
chateau
the
sobs
had
ceased
if
we
can
t
hear
we
may
at
least
try
to
see
said
rouletabille
and
making
a
sign
to
me
to
deaden
the
sound
of
my
steps
he
led
me
across
the
path
to
the
trunk
of
a
tall
beech
tree
the
white
bole
of
which
was
visible
in
the
darkness
this
tree
grew
exactly
in
front
of
the
window
in
which
we
were
so
much
interested
its
lower
branches
being
on
a
level
with
the
first
floor
of
the
chateau
from
the
height
of
those
branches
one
might
certainly
see
what
was
passing
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
evidently
that
was
what
rouletabille
thought
for
enjoining
me
to
remain
hidden
he
clasped
the
trunk
with
his
vigorous
arms
and
climbed
up
i
soon
lost
sight
of
him
amid
the
branches
and
then
followed
a
deep
silence
in
front
of
me
the
open
window
remained
lighted
and
i
saw
no
shadow
move
across
it
i
listened
and
presently
from
above
me
these
words
reached
my
ears
after
you
after
you
pray
somebody
was
overhead
speaking
exchanging
courtesies
what
was
my
astonishment
to
see
on
the
slippery
column
of
the
tree
two
human
forms
appear
and
quietly
slip
down
to
the
ground
rouletabille
had
mounted
alone
and
had
returned
with
another
good
evening
monsieur
sainclair
it
was
frederic
larsan
the
detective
had
already
occupied
the
post
of
observation
when
my
young
friend
had
thought
to
reach
it
alone
neither
noticed
my
astonishment
i
explained
that
to
myself
by
the
fact
that
they
must
have
been
witnesses
of
some
tender
and
despairing
scene
between
mademoiselle
stangerson
lying
in
her
bed
and
monsieur
darzac
on
his
knees
by
her
pillow
i
guessed
that
each
had
drawn
different
conclusions
from
what
they
had
seen
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
scene
had
strongly
impressed
rouletabille
in
favour
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
while
to
larsan
it
showed
nothing
but
consummate
hypocrisy
acted
with
finished
art
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
as
we
reached
the
park
gate
larsan
stopped
us
my
cane
he
cried
i
left
it
near
the
he
left
us
saying
he
would
rejoin
us
presently
have
you
noticed
frederic
larsan
s
cane
asked
the
young
reporter
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
it
is
quite
a
new
one
which
i
have
never
seen
him
use
before
he
seems
to
take
great
care
of
it
it
never
leaves
him
one
would
think
he
was
afraid
it
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
strangers
i
never
saw
it
before
where
did
he
find
it
it
isn
t
natural
that
a
man
who
had
never
before
used
a
should
the
day
after
the
glandier
crime
never
move
a
step
without
one
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
at
the
chateau
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
put
his
watch
in
his
pocket
and
picked
up
his
cane
from
the
ground
a
proceeding
to
which
i
was
perhaps
wrong
not
to
attach
some
we
were
now
out
of
the
park
rouletabille
had
dropped
into
silence
his
thoughts
were
certainly
still
occupied
with
frederic
larsan
s
new
cane
i
had
proof
of
that
when
as
we
came
near
to
epinay
he
said
frederic
larsan
arrived
at
the
glandier
before
me
he
began
his
inquiry
before
me
he
has
had
time
to
find
out
things
about
which
i
know
nothing
where
did
he
find
that
cane
then
he
added
it
is
probable
that
his
suspicion
more
than
that
his
reasoning
has
led
him
to
lay
his
hand
on
something
tangible
has
this
cane
anything
to
do
with
it
where
the
deuce
could
he
have
found
it
as
i
had
to
wait
twenty
minutes
for
the
train
at
epinay
we
entered
a
wine
shop
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
and
frederic
larsan
made
his
appearance
brandishing
his
famous
cane
i
found
it
he
said
laughingly
the
three
of
us
seated
ourselves
at
a
table
rouletabille
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
cane
he
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
notice
a
sign
larsan
made
to
a
railway
employeee
a
young
man
with
a
chin
decorated
by
a
tiny
blond
and
beard
on
the
sign
he
rose
paid
for
his
drink
bowed
and
went
out
i
should
not
myself
have
attached
any
importance
to
the
circumstance
if
it
had
not
been
recalled
to
my
mind
some
months
later
by
the
reappearance
of
the
man
with
the
beard
at
one
of
the
most
tragic
moments
of
this
case
i
then
learned
that
the
youth
was
one
of
larsan
s
assistants
and
had
been
charged
by
him
to
watch
the
going
and
coming
of
travellers
at
the
station
of
larsan
neglected
nothing
in
any
case
on
which
he
was
engaged
i
turned
my
eyes
again
on
rouletabille
ah
monsieur
fred
he
said
when
did
you
begin
to
use
a
i
have
always
seen
you
walking
with
your
hands
in
your
pockets
it
is
a
present
replied
the
detective
recent
insisted
rouletabille
no
it
was
given
to
me
in
ah
yes
i
remember
you
have
just
come
from
london
may
i
look
at
it
oh
certainly
fred
passed
the
cane
to
rouletabille
it
was
a
large
yellow
bamboo
with
a
crutch
handle
and
ornamented
with
a
gold
ring
rouletabille
after
examining
it
minutely
returned
it
to
larsan
with
a
bantering
expression
on
his
face
saying
you
were
given
a
french
cane
in
london
possibly
said
fred
imperturbably
read
the
mark
there
in
tiny
letters
cassette
can
not
english
people
buy
canes
in
paris
when
rouletabille
had
seen
me
into
the
train
he
said
you
ll
remember
the
address
yes
cassette
opera
rely
on
me
you
shall
have
word
tomorrow
that
evening
on
reaching
paris
i
saw
monsieur
cassette
dealer
in
and
umbrellas
and
wrote
to
my
friend
a
man
unmistakably
answering
to
the
description
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
same
height
slightly
stooping
overcoat
bowler
hat
purchased
a
cane
similar
to
the
one
in
which
we
are
interested
on
the
evening
of
the
crime
about
eight
o
clock
monsieur
cassette
had
not
sold
another
such
cane
during
the
last
two
years
fred
s
cane
is
new
it
is
quite
clear
that
it
s
the
same
cane
fred
did
not
buy
it
since
he
was
in
london
like
you
i
think
that
he
found
it
somewhere
near
monsieur
robert
darzac
but
if
as
you
suppose
the
murderer
was
in
the
yellow
room
for
five
or
even
six
hours
and
the
crime
was
not
committed
until
towards
midnight
the
purchase
of
this
cane
proves
an
incontestable
alibi
for
chapter
xiii
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
brightness
a
week
after
the
occurrence
of
the
events
i
have
just
recounted
on
the
of
november
to
be
exact
i
received
at
my
home
in
paris
the
following
telegraphic
message
come
to
the
glandier
by
the
earliest
train
bring
revolvers
friendly
greetings
i
have
already
said
i
think
that
at
that
period
being
a
young
barrister
with
but
few
briefs
i
frequented
the
palais
de
justice
rather
for
the
purpose
of
familiarising
myself
with
my
professional
duties
than
for
the
defence
of
the
widow
and
orphan
i
could
therefore
feel
no
surprise
at
rouletabille
disposing
of
my
time
moreover
he
knew
how
keenly
interested
i
was
in
his
journalistic
adventures
in
general
and
above
all
in
the
murder
at
the
glandier
i
had
not
heard
from
him
for
a
week
nor
of
the
progress
made
with
that
mysterious
case
except
by
the
innumerable
paragraphs
in
the
newspapers
and
by
the
very
brief
notes
of
rouletabille
in
the
those
notes
had
divulged
the
fact
that
traces
of
human
blood
had
been
found
on
the
as
well
as
fresh
traces
of
the
blood
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
the
old
stains
belonged
to
other
crimes
probably
dating
years
back
it
may
be
easily
imagined
that
the
crime
engaged
the
attention
of
the
press
throughout
the
world
no
crime
known
had
more
absorbed
the
minds
of
people
it
appeared
to
me
however
that
the
judicial
inquiry
was
making
but
very
little
progress
and
i
should
have
been
very
glad
if
on
the
receipt
of
my
friend
s
invitation
to
rejoin
him
at
the
glandier
the
despatch
had
not
contained
the
words
bring
that
puzzled
me
greatly
rouletabille
telegraphing
for
revolvers
meant
that
there
might
be
occasion
to
use
them
now
i
confess
it
without
shame
i
am
not
a
hero
but
here
was
a
friend
evidently
in
danger
calling
on
me
to
go
to
his
aid
i
did
not
hesitate
long
and
after
assuring
myself
that
the
only
revolver
i
possessed
was
properly
loaded
i
hurried
towards
the
orleans
station
on
the
way
i
remembered
that
rouletabille
had
asked
for
two
revolvers
i
therefore
entered
a
gunsmith
s
shop
and
bought
an
excellent
weapon
for
my
friend
i
had
hoped
to
find
him
at
the
station
at
epinay
but
he
was
not
there
however
a
cab
was
waiting
for
me
and
i
was
soon
at
the
glandier
nobody
was
at
the
gate
and
it
was
only
on
the
threshold
of
the
chateau
that
i
met
the
young
man
he
saluted
me
with
a
friendly
gesture
and
threw
his
arms
about
me
inquiring
warmly
as
to
the
state
of
my
health
when
we
were
in
the
little
of
which
i
have
spoken
rouletabille
made
me
sit
down
it
s
going
badly
he
said
what
s
going
badly
i
asked
he
came
nearer
to
me
and
whispered
frederic
larsan
is
working
with
might
and
main
against
this
did
not
astonish
me
i
had
seen
the
poor
show
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
had
made
at
the
time
of
the
examination
of
the
footprints
however
i
immediately
asked
what
about
that
cane
it
is
still
in
the
hands
of
frederic
larsan
he
never
lets
go
of
but
doesn
t
it
prove
the
alibi
for
monsieur
darzac
not
at
all
gently
questioned
by
me
darzac
denied
having
on
that
evening
or
on
any
other
purchased
a
cane
at
cassette
s
however
said
rouletabille
i
ll
not
swear
to
anything
monsieur
darzac
has
such
strange
fits
of
silence
that
one
does
not
know
exactly
what
to
think
of
what
he
to
frederic
larsan
this
cane
must
mean
a
piece
of
very
damaging
evidence
but
in
what
way
the
time
when
it
was
bought
shows
it
could
not
have
been
in
the
murderer
s
the
time
doesn
t
worry
larsan
he
is
not
obliged
to
adopt
my
theory
which
assumes
that
the
murderer
got
into
the
yellow
room
between
five
and
six
o
clock
but
there
s
nothing
to
prevent
him
assuming
that
the
murderer
got
in
between
ten
and
eleven
o
clock
at
night
at
that
hour
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
assisted
by
daddy
jacques
were
engaged
in
making
an
interesting
chemical
experiment
in
the
part
of
the
laboratory
taken
up
by
the
furnaces
larsan
says
unlikely
as
that
may
seem
that
the
murderer
may
have
slipped
behind
them
he
has
already
got
the
examining
magistrate
to
listen
to
him
when
one
looks
closely
into
it
the
reasoning
is
absurd
seeing
that
the
intimate
if
there
is
one
must
have
known
that
the
professor
would
shortly
leave
the
pavilion
and
that
the
friend
had
only
to
put
off
operating
till
after
the
professor
s
departure
why
should
he
have
risked
crossing
the
laboratory
while
the
professor
was
in
it
and
then
when
he
had
got
into
the
yellow
room
there
are
many
points
to
be
cleared
up
before
larsan
s
theory
can
be
admitted
i
sha
n
t
waste
my
time
over
it
for
my
theory
won
t
allow
me
to
occupy
myself
with
mere
imagination
only
as
i
am
obliged
for
the
moment
to
keep
silent
and
larsan
sometimes
talks
he
may
finish
by
coming
out
openly
against
monsieur
darzac
if
i
m
not
there
added
the
young
reporter
proudly
for
there
are
surface
evidences
against
darzac
much
more
convincing
than
that
cane
which
remains
incomprehensible
to
me
all
the
more
so
as
larsan
does
not
in
the
least
hesitate
to
let
darzac
see
him
with
it
i
understand
many
things
in
larsan
s
theory
but
i
can
t
make
anything
of
that
cane
is
he
still
at
the
chateau
yes
he
hardly
ever
leaves
it
he
sleeps
there
as
i
do
at
the
request
of
monsieur
stangerson
who
has
done
for
him
what
monsieur
robert
darzac
has
done
for
me
in
spite
of
the
accusation
made
by
larsan
that
monsieur
stangerson
knows
who
the
murderer
is
he
yet
affords
him
every
facility
for
arriving
at
the
truth
just
as
darzac
is
doing
for
but
you
are
convinced
of
darzac
s
innocence
at
one
time
i
did
believe
in
the
possibility
of
his
guilt
that
was
when
we
arrived
here
for
the
first
time
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
tell
you
what
has
passed
between
monsieur
darzac
and
here
rouletabille
interrupted
himself
and
asked
me
if
i
had
brought
the
revolvers
i
showed
him
them
having
examined
both
he
pronounced
them
excellent
and
handed
them
back
to
me
shall
we
have
any
use
for
them
i
asked
no
doubt
this
evening
we
shall
pass
the
night
here
if
that
won
t
tire
you
on
the
contrary
i
said
with
an
expression
that
made
rouletabille
laugh
no
no
he
said
this
is
no
time
for
laughing
you
remember
the
phrase
which
was
the
open
sesame
of
this
chateau
full
of
mystery
yes
i
said
perfectly
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
it
was
the
phrase
which
you
found
on
the
piece
of
paper
amongst
the
ashes
in
the
yes
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
where
the
flame
had
not
reached
was
this
date
of
october
remember
this
date
it
is
highly
important
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
about
that
curious
phrase
on
the
evening
before
the
crime
that
is
to
say
on
the
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
were
at
a
reception
at
the
elysee
i
know
that
because
i
was
there
on
duty
having
to
interview
one
of
the
savants
of
the
academy
of
philadelphia
who
was
being
feted
there
i
had
never
before
seen
either
monsieur
or
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
was
seated
in
the
room
which
precedes
the
salon
des
ambassadeurs
and
tired
of
being
jostled
by
so
many
noble
personages
i
had
fallen
into
a
vague
reverie
when
i
scented
near
me
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
do
you
ask
me
what
is
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
it
must
suffice
for
you
to
know
that
it
is
a
perfume
of
which
i
am
very
fond
because
it
was
that
of
a
lady
who
had
been
very
kind
to
me
in
my
childhood
a
lady
whom
i
had
always
seen
dressed
in
black
the
lady
who
that
evening
was
scented
with
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
was
dressed
in
white
she
was
wonderfully
beautiful
i
could
not
help
rising
and
following
her
an
old
man
gave
her
his
arm
and
as
they
passed
i
heard
voices
say
professor
stangerson
and
his
it
was
in
that
way
i
learned
who
it
was
i
was
following
they
met
monsieur
robert
darzac
whom
i
knew
by
sight
professor
stangerson
accosted
by
arthur
william
rance
one
of
the
american
savants
seated
himself
in
the
great
gallery
and
monsieur
robert
darzac
led
mademoiselle
stangerson
into
the
conservatory
i
followed
the
weather
was
very
mild
that
evening
the
garden
doors
were
open
mademoiselle
stangerson
threw
a
fichu
shawl
over
her
shoulders
and
i
plainly
saw
that
it
was
she
who
was
begging
monsieur
darzac
to
go
with
her
into
the
garden
i
continued
to
follow
interested
by
the
agitation
plainly
exhibited
by
the
bearing
of
monsieur
darzac
they
slowly
passed
along
the
wall
abutting
on
the
avenue
marigny
i
took
the
central
alley
walking
parallel
with
them
and
then
crossed
over
for
the
purpose
of
getting
nearer
to
them
the
night
was
dark
and
the
grass
deadened
the
sound
of
my
steps
they
had
stopped
under
the
vacillating
light
of
a
gas
jet
and
appeared
to
be
both
bending
over
a
paper
held
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
reading
something
which
deeply
interested
them
i
stopped
in
the
darkness
and
silence
neither
of
them
saw
me
and
i
distinctly
heard
mademoiselle
stangerson
repeat
as
she
was
refolding
the
paper
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
brightness
it
was
said
in
a
tone
at
once
mocking
and
despairing
and
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
such
nervous
laughter
that
i
think
her
words
will
never
cease
to
sound
in
my
ears
but
another
phrase
was
uttered
by
monsieur
robert
darzac
must
i
commit
a
crime
then
to
win
you
he
was
in
an
extraordinarily
agitated
state
he
took
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
held
it
for
a
long
time
to
his
lips
and
i
thought
from
the
movement
of
his
shoulders
that
he
was
crying
then
they
went
away
when
i
returned
to
the
great
gallery
continued
rouletabille
i
saw
no
more
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
and
i
was
not
to
see
him
again
until
after
the
tragedy
at
the
glandier
mademoiselle
was
near
rance
who
was
talking
with
much
animation
his
eyes
during
the
conversation
glowing
with
a
singular
brightness
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
thought
was
not
even
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
her
face
expressing
perfect
indifference
his
face
was
the
red
face
of
a
drunkard
when
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
left
he
went
to
the
bar
and
remained
there
i
joined
him
and
rendered
him
some
little
service
in
the
midst
of
the
pressing
crowd
he
thanked
me
and
told
me
he
was
returning
to
america
three
days
later
that
is
to
say
on
the
the
day
after
the
crime
i
talked
with
him
about
philadelphia
he
told
me
he
had
lived
there
for
years
and
that
it
was
there
he
had
met
the
illustrious
professor
stangerson
and
his
daughter
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
champagne
and
when
i
left
him
he
was
very
nearly
drunk
such
were
my
experiences
on
that
evening
and
i
leave
you
to
imagine
what
effect
the
news
of
the
attempted
murder
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
produced
on
me
with
what
force
those
words
pronounced
by
monsieur
robert
darzac
must
i
commit
a
crime
then
to
win
you
recurred
to
me
it
was
not
this
phrase
however
that
i
repeated
to
him
when
we
met
here
at
glandier
the
sentence
of
the
presbytery
and
the
bright
garden
sufficed
to
open
the
gate
of
the
chateau
if
you
ask
me
if
i
believe
now
that
monsieur
darzac
is
the
murderer
i
must
say
i
do
not
i
do
not
think
i
ever
quite
thought
that
at
the
time
i
could
not
really
think
seriously
of
anything
i
had
so
little
evidence
to
go
on
but
i
needed
to
have
at
once
the
proof
that
he
had
not
been
wounded
in
the
hand
when
we
were
alone
together
i
told
him
how
i
had
chanced
to
overhear
a
part
of
his
conversation
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
the
garden
of
the
elysee
and
when
i
repeated
to
him
the
words
must
i
commit
a
crime
then
to
win
you
he
was
greatly
troubled
though
much
less
so
than
he
had
been
by
hearing
me
repeat
the
phrase
about
the
presbytery
what
threw
him
into
a
state
of
real
consternation
was
to
learn
from
me
that
the
day
on
which
he
had
gone
to
meet
mademoiselle
stangerson
at
the
elysee
was
the
very
day
on
which
she
had
gone
to
the
post
office
for
the
letter
it
was
that
letter
perhaps
which
ended
with
the
words
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
my
surmise
was
confirmed
by
my
finding
if
you
remember
in
the
ashes
of
the
laboratory
the
fragment
of
paper
dated
october
the
the
letter
had
been
written
and
withdrawn
from
the
post
office
on
the
same
day
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
on
returning
from
the
elysee
that
night
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
tried
to
destroy
that
compromising
paper
it
was
in
vain
that
monsieur
darzac
denied
that
that
letter
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
crime
i
told
him
that
in
an
affair
so
filled
with
mystery
as
this
he
had
no
right
to
hide
this
letter
that
i
was
persuaded
it
was
of
considerable
importance
that
the
desperate
tone
in
which
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
pronounced
the
prophetic
phrase
that
his
own
tears
and
the
threat
of
a
crime
which
he
had
professed
after
the
letter
was
read
all
these
facts
tended
to
leave
no
room
for
me
to
doubt
monsieur
darzac
became
more
and
more
agitated
and
i
determined
to
take
advantage
of
the
effect
i
had
produced
on
him
you
were
on
the
point
of
being
married
monsieur
i
said
negligently
and
without
looking
at
him
and
suddenly
your
marriage
becomes
impossible
because
of
the
writer
of
that
letter
because
as
soon
as
his
letter
was
read
you
spoke
of
the
necessity
for
a
crime
to
win
mademoiselle
stangerson
therefore
there
is
someone
between
you
and
her
someone
who
is
preventing
your
marriage
with
her
someone
who
has
attempted
to
kill
her
so
that
she
should
not
be
able
to
marry
and
i
concluded
with
these
words
now
monsieur
you
have
only
to
tell
me
in
confidence
the
name
of
the
murderer
the
words
i
had
uttered
must
have
struck
him
ominously
for
when
i
turned
my
eyes
on
him
i
saw
that
his
face
was
haggard
the
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
and
terror
showing
in
his
eyes
monsieur
he
said
to
me
i
am
going
to
ask
of
you
something
which
may
appear
insane
but
in
exchange
for
which
i
place
my
life
in
your
hands
you
must
not
tell
the
magistrates
of
what
you
saw
and
heard
in
the
garden
of
the
elysee
neither
to
them
nor
to
anybody
i
swear
to
you
that
i
am
innocent
and
i
know
i
feel
that
you
believe
me
but
i
would
rather
be
taken
for
the
guilty
man
than
see
justice
go
astray
on
that
phrase
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
the
judges
must
know
nothing
about
that
phrase
all
this
matter
is
in
your
hands
monsieur
i
leave
it
there
but
forget
the
evening
at
the
elysee
a
hundred
other
roads
are
open
to
you
in
your
search
for
the
criminal
i
will
open
them
for
you
myself
i
will
help
you
will
you
take
up
your
quarters
here
you
may
remain
here
to
do
as
you
eat
sleep
here
watch
my
actions
the
actions
of
all
here
you
shall
be
master
of
the
glandier
monsieur
but
forget
the
evening
at
the
rouletabille
here
paused
to
take
breath
i
now
understood
what
had
appeared
so
unexplainable
in
the
demeanour
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
towards
my
friend
and
the
facility
with
which
the
young
reporter
had
been
able
to
install
himself
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
my
curiosity
could
not
fail
to
be
excited
by
all
i
had
heard
i
asked
rouletabille
to
satisfy
it
still
further
what
had
happened
at
the
glandier
during
the
past
week
had
he
not
told
me
that
there
were
surface
indications
against
monsieur
darzac
much
more
terrible
than
that
of
the
cane
found
by
larsan
everything
seems
to
be
pointing
against
him
replied
my
friend
and
the
situation
is
becoming
exceedingly
grave
monsieur
darzac
appears
not
to
mind
it
much
but
in
that
he
is
wrong
i
was
interested
only
in
the
health
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
which
was
daily
improving
when
something
occurred
that
is
even
more
mysterious
than
than
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
impossible
i
cried
what
could
be
more
mysterious
than
that
let
us
first
go
back
to
monsieur
robert
darzac
said
rouletabille
calming
me
i
have
said
that
everything
seems
to
be
pointing
against
him
the
marks
of
the
neat
boots
found
by
frederic
larsan
appear
to
be
really
the
footprints
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
the
marks
made
by
the
bicycle
may
have
been
made
by
his
bicycle
he
had
usually
left
it
at
the
chateau
why
did
he
take
it
to
paris
on
that
particular
occasion
was
it
because
he
was
not
going
to
return
again
to
the
chateau
was
it
because
owing
to
the
breaking
off
of
his
marriage
his
relations
with
the
stangersons
were
to
cease
all
who
are
interested
in
the
matter
affirm
that
those
relations
were
to
continue
unchanged
frederic
larsan
however
believes
that
all
relations
were
at
an
end
from
the
day
when
monsieur
darzac
accompanied
mademoiselle
stangerson
to
the
grands
magasins
de
la
louvre
until
the
day
after
the
crime
he
had
not
been
at
the
glandier
remember
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
lost
her
reticule
containing
the
key
with
the
brass
head
while
she
was
in
his
company
from
that
day
to
the
evening
at
the
elysee
the
sorbonne
professor
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
did
not
see
one
another
but
they
may
have
written
to
each
other
mademoiselle
stangerson
went
to
the
post
office
to
get
a
letter
which
larsan
says
was
written
by
robert
darzac
for
knowing
nothing
of
what
had
passed
at
the
elysee
larsan
believes
that
it
was
monsieur
darzac
himself
who
stole
the
reticule
with
the
key
with
the
design
of
forcing
her
consent
by
getting
possession
of
the
precious
papers
of
her
father
papers
which
he
would
have
restored
to
him
on
condition
that
the
marriage
engagement
was
to
be
fulfilled
all
that
would
have
been
a
very
doubtful
and
almost
absurd
hypothesis
as
larsan
admitted
to
me
but
for
another
and
much
graver
circumstance
in
the
first
place
here
is
something
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
explain
monsieur
darzac
had
himself
on
the
gone
to
the
post
office
to
ask
for
the
letter
which
mademoiselle
had
called
for
and
received
on
the
previous
evening
the
description
of
the
man
who
made
application
tallies
in
every
respect
with
the
appearance
of
monsieur
darzac
who
in
answer
to
the
questions
put
to
him
by
the
examining
magistrate
denies
that
he
went
to
the
post
office
now
even
admitting
that
the
letter
was
written
by
him
which
i
do
not
believe
he
knew
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
received
it
since
he
had
seen
it
in
her
hands
in
the
garden
at
the
elysee
it
could
not
have
been
he
then
who
had
gone
to
the
post
office
the
day
after
the
to
ask
for
a
letter
which
he
knew
was
no
longer
there
to
me
it
appears
clear
that
somebody
strongly
resembling
him
stole
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
reticule
and
in
that
letter
had
demanded
of
her
something
which
she
had
not
sent
him
he
must
have
been
surprised
at
the
failure
of
his
demand
hence
his
application
at
the
post
office
to
learn
whether
his
letter
had
been
delivered
to
the
person
to
whom
it
had
been
addressed
finding
that
it
had
been
claimed
he
had
become
furious
what
had
he
demanded
nobody
but
mademoiselle
stangerson
knows
then
on
the
day
following
it
is
reported
that
she
had
been
attacked
during
the
night
and
the
next
day
i
discovered
that
the
professor
had
at
the
same
time
been
robbed
by
means
of
the
key
referred
to
in
the
poste
restante
letter
it
would
seem
then
that
the
man
who
went
to
the
post
office
to
inquire
for
the
letter
must
have
been
the
murderer
all
these
arguments
larsan
applies
as
against
monsieur
darzac
you
may
be
sure
that
the
examining
magistrate
larsan
and
myself
have
done
our
best
to
get
from
the
post
office
precise
details
relative
to
the
singular
personage
who
applied
there
on
the
of
october
but
nothing
has
been
learned
we
don
t
know
where
he
came
from
or
where
he
went
beyond
the
description
which
makes
him
resemble
monsieur
darzac
we
know
nothing
i
have
announced
in
the
leading
journals
that
a
handsome
reward
will
be
given
to
a
driver
of
any
public
conveyance
who
drove
a
fare
to
no
post
office
about
ten
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
information
to
be
addressed
to
m
at
the
office
of
the
epoque
but
no
answer
has
resulted
the
man
may
have
walked
but
as
he
was
most
likely
in
a
hurry
there
was
a
chance
that
he
might
have
gone
in
a
cab
who
i
keep
asking
myself
night
and
day
is
the
man
who
so
strongly
resembles
monsieur
robert
darzac
and
who
is
also
known
to
have
bought
the
cane
which
has
fallen
into
larsan
s
hands
the
most
serious
fact
is
that
monsieur
darzac
was
at
the
very
same
time
that
his
double
presented
himself
at
the
post
office
scheduled
for
a
lecture
at
the
sorbonne
he
had
not
delivered
that
lecture
and
one
of
his
friends
took
his
place
when
i
questioned
him
as
to
how
he
had
employeeed
the
time
he
told
me
that
he
had
gone
for
a
stroll
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
what
do
you
think
of
a
professor
who
instead
of
giving
his
lecture
obtains
a
substitute
to
go
for
a
stroll
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
when
frederic
larsan
asked
him
for
information
on
this
point
he
quietly
replied
that
it
was
no
business
of
his
how
he
spent
his
time
in
paris
on
which
fred
swore
aloud
that
he
would
find
out
without
anybody
s
help
all
this
seems
to
fit
in
with
fred
s
hypothesis
namely
that
monsieur
stangerson
allowed
the
murderer
to
escape
in
order
to
avoid
a
scandal
the
hypothesis
is
further
substantiated
by
the
fact
that
darzac
was
in
the
yellow
room
and
was
permitted
to
get
away
that
hypothesis
i
believe
to
be
a
false
larsan
is
being
misled
by
it
though
that
would
not
displease
me
did
it
not
affect
an
innocent
person
now
does
that
hypothesis
really
mislead
frederic
larsan
that
is
the
question
that
is
the
perhaps
he
is
right
i
cried
interrupting
rouletabille
are
you
sure
that
monsieur
darzac
is
innocent
it
seems
to
me
that
these
are
extraordinary
coincidences
coincidences
replied
my
friend
are
the
worst
enemies
to
what
does
the
examining
magistrate
think
now
of
the
matter
monsieur
de
marquet
hesitates
to
accuse
monsieur
darzac
in
the
absence
of
absolute
proofs
not
only
would
he
have
public
opinion
wholly
against
him
to
say
nothing
of
the
sorbonne
but
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
she
adores
monsieur
robert
darzac
indistinctly
as
she
saw
the
murderer
it
would
be
hard
to
make
the
public
believe
that
she
could
not
have
recognised
him
if
darzac
had
been
the
criminal
no
doubt
the
yellow
room
was
very
dimly
lit
but
a
however
small
gives
some
light
here
my
boy
is
how
things
stood
when
three
days
or
rather
three
nights
ago
an
extraordinarily
strange
incident
chapter
xiv
i
expect
the
assassin
this
evening
i
must
take
you
said
rouletabille
so
as
to
enable
you
to
understand
to
the
various
scenes
i
myself
believe
that
i
have
discovered
what
everybody
else
is
searching
for
namely
how
the
murderer
escaped
from
the
yellow
room
without
any
accomplice
and
without
mademoiselle
stangerson
having
had
anything
to
do
with
it
but
so
long
as
i
am
not
sure
of
the
real
murderer
i
can
not
state
the
theory
on
which
i
am
working
i
can
only
say
that
i
believe
it
to
be
correct
and
in
any
case
a
quite
natural
and
simple
one
as
to
what
happened
in
this
place
three
nights
ago
i
must
say
it
kept
me
wondering
for
a
whole
day
and
a
night
it
passes
all
belief
the
theory
i
have
formed
from
the
incident
is
so
absurd
that
i
would
rather
matters
remained
as
yet
saying
which
the
young
reporter
invited
me
to
go
and
make
the
tour
of
the
chateau
with
him
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
crunching
of
the
dead
leaves
beneath
our
feet
the
silence
was
so
intense
that
one
might
have
thought
the
chateau
had
been
abandoned
the
old
stones
the
stagnant
water
of
the
ditch
surrounding
the
donjon
the
bleak
ground
strewn
with
the
dead
leaves
the
dark
outlines
of
the
trees
all
contributed
to
give
to
the
desolate
place
now
filled
with
its
awful
mystery
a
most
funereal
aspect
as
we
passed
round
the
donjon
we
met
the
green
man
the
who
did
not
greet
us
but
walked
by
as
if
we
had
not
existed
he
was
looking
just
as
i
had
formerly
seen
him
through
the
window
of
the
donjon
inn
he
had
still
his
slung
at
his
back
his
pipe
was
in
his
mouth
and
his
on
his
nose
an
odd
kind
of
fish
rouletabille
said
to
me
in
a
low
tone
have
you
spoken
to
him
i
asked
yes
but
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
his
only
answers
are
grunts
and
shrugs
of
the
shoulders
he
generally
lives
on
the
first
floor
of
the
donjon
a
big
room
that
once
served
for
an
oratory
he
lives
like
a
bear
never

eye
upon

in
after
passing
the

at

end
of

we
went
to
the
back
of
the
chateau
rouletabille
pointing
to
a
window
which
i
recognised
as
the
only
one
belonging
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
apartment
said
to
me
if
you
had
been
here
two
nights
ago
you
would
have
seen
your
humble
servant
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
about
to
enter
the
chateau
by
that
as
i
expressed
some
surprise
at
this
piece
of
nocturnal
gymnastics
he
begged
me
to
notice
carefully
the
exterior
disposition
of
the
chateau
we
then
went
back
into
the
building
i
must
now
show

could

along

mademoiselle

had

in

we
entered
the

to
the
right
a
narrow
carpet
laid
on
the
waxed
oaken
floor
which
shone
like
glass
deadened
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
rouletabille
asked
me
in
a
low
tone
to
walk
carefully
as
we
were
passing
the
door
of
mademoiselle
stangerson

this
consisted
of
a
an
a

was

about

at

we

the

quitting
it
at

the

winding

in
the

it
was
at
the
meeting
point
of
the
two

that
rouletabille
had
his
chamber
adjoining
that
of
frederic

the

each
opening
on
to
the

while
the
doors
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s

opened
into
the
right
gallery
see
the
plan
rouletabille
opened
the
door
of
his
room
and
after
we
had
passed
in
carefully
drew
the
bolt
i
had
not
had
time
to
glance
round
the
place
in
which
he
had
been
installed
when
he
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
pointed
to
a
pair
of
on
a
what
are
these
doing
here
he
asked
i
should
have
been
puzzled
to
answer
him
i
wonder
he
said
i
wonder
if
this
is
what
i
have
been
searching
for
i
wonder
if
these
are
the
from
the
presbytery
he
seized
them
eagerly
his
fingers
caressing
the
glass
then
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
of
terror
on
his
face
he
murmured
oh
oh
he
repeated
the
exclamation
again
and
again
as
if
his
thoughts
had
suddenly
turned
his
brain
he
rose
and
putting
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
laughed
like
one
demented
as
he
said
those
glasses
will
drive
me
silly
mathematically
speaking
the
thing
is
possible
but
humanly
speaking
it
is
impossible
or
afterwards
or
afterwards
two
light
knocks
struck
the
door
rouletabille
opened
it
a
figure
entered
i
recognised
the
concierge
whom
i
had
seen
when
she
was
being
taken
to
the
pavilion
for
examination
i
was
surprised
thinking
she
was
still
under
lock
and
key
this
woman
said
in
a
very
low
tone
in
the
grove
of
the
rouletabille
replied
the
woman
then
left
he
again
turned
to
me
his
look
haggard
after
having
carefully
refastened
the
door
muttering
some
incomprehensible
phrases
if
the
thing
is
mathematically
possible
why
should
it
not
be
humanly
and
if
it
is
humanly
possible
the
matter
is
simply
i
interrupted
him
in
his
soliloquy
have
they
set
the
concierges
at
liberty
then
i
asked
yes
he
replied
i
had
them
liberated
i
needed
people
i
could
trust
the
woman
is
thoroughly
devoted
to
me
and
her
husband
would
lay
down
his
life
for
oho
i
said
when
will
he
have
occasion
to
do
it
this
evening
for
this
evening
i
expect
the
you
expect
the
murderer
this
evening
then
you
know
him
i
shall
know
him
but
i
should
be
mad
to
affirm
categorically
at
this
moment
that
i
do
know
him
the
mathematical
idea
i
have
of
the
murderer
gives
results
so
frightful
so
monstrous
that
i
hope
it
is
still
possible
that
i
am
mistaken
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
five
minutes
ago
you
did
not
know
the
murderer
how
can
you
say
that
you
expect
him
this
evening
because
i
know
that
he
must
rouletabille
very
slowly
filled
his
pipe
and
lit
it
that
meant
an
interesting
story
at
that
moment
we
heard
some
one
walking
in
the
gallery
and
passing
before
our
door
rouletabille
listened
the
sound
of
the
footstep
died
away
in
the
distance
is
frederic
larsan
in
his
room
i
asked
pointing
to
the
partition
no
my
friend
answered
he
went
to
paris
this
morning
still
on
the
scent
of
darzac
who
also
left
for
paris
that
matter
will
turn
out
badly
i
expect
that
monsieur
darzac
will
be
arrested
in
the
course
of
the
next
week
the
worst
of
it
is
that
everything
seems
to
be
in
league
against
him
circumstances
things
people
not
an
hour
passes
without
bringing
some
new
evidence
against
him
the
examining
magistrate
is
overwhelmed
by
it
and
frederic
larsan
however
is
not
a
novice
i
said
i
thought
so
said
rouletabille
with
a
slightly
contemptuous
turn
of
his
lips
i
fancied
he
was
a
much
abler
man
i
had
indeed
a
great
admiration
for
him
before
i
got
to
know
his
method
of
working
it
s
deplorable
he
owes
his
reputation
solely
to
his
ability
but
he
lacks
reasoning
power
the
mathematics
of
his
ideas
are
very
i
looked
closely
at
rouletabille
and
could
not
help
smiling
on
hearing
this
boy
of
eighteen
talking
of
a
man
who
had
proved
to
the
world
that
he
was
the
finest
police
sleuth
in
europe
you
smile
he
said
you
are
wrong
i
swear
i
will
outwit
him
and
in
a
striking
way
but
i
must
make
haste
about
it
for
he
has
an
enormous
start
on
me
given
him
by
monsieur
robert
darzac
who
is
this
evening
going
to
increase
it
still
more
think
of
it
every
time
the
murderer
comes
to
the
chateau
monsieur
darzac
by
a
strange
fatality
absents
himself
and
refuses
to
give
any
account
of
how
he
employs
his
every
time
the
assassin
comes
to
the
chateau
i
cried
has
he
returned
then
yes
during
that
famous
night
when
the
strange
phenomenon
i
was
now
going
to
learn
about
the
astonishing
phenomenon
to
which
rouletabille
had
made
allusion
half
an
hour
earlier
without
giving
me
any
explanation
of
it
but
i
had
learned
never
to
press
rouletabille
in
his
narratives
he
spoke
when
the
fancy
took
him
and
when
he
judged
it
to
be
right
he
was
less
concerned
about
my
curiosity
than
he
was
for
making
a
complete
summing
up
for
himself
of
any
important
matter
in
which
he
was
interested
at
last
in
short
rapid
phrases
he
acquainted
me
with
things
which
plunged
me
into
a
state
bordering
on
complete
bewilderment
indeed
the
results
of
that
still
unknown
science
known
as
hypnotism
for
example
were
not
more
inexplicable
than
the
disappearance
of
the
matter
of
the
murderer
at
the
moment
when
four
persons
were
within
touch
of
him
i
speak
of
hypnotism
as
i
would
of
electricity
for
of
the
nature
of
both
we
are
ignorant
and
we
know
little
of
their
laws
i
cite
these
examples
because
at
the
time
the
case
appeared
to
me
to
be
only
explicable
by
the
inexplicable
that
is
to
say
by
an
event
outside
of
known
natural
laws
and
yet
if
i
had
had
rouletabille
s
brain
i
should
like
him
have
had
a
presentiment
of
the
natural
explanation
for
the
most
curious
thing
about
all
the
mysteries
of
the
glandier
case
was
the
natural
manner
in
which
he
explained
them
i
have
among
the
papers
that
were
sent
me
by
the
young
man
after
the
affair
was
over
a
of
his
in
which
a
complete
account
is
given
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
disappearance
of
the
matter
of
the
assassin
and
the
thoughts
to
which
it
gave
rise
in
the
mind
of
my
young
friend
it
is
preferable
i
think
to
give
the
reader
this
account
rather
than
continue
to
reproduce
my
conversation
with
rouletabille
for
i
should
be
afraid
in
a
history
of
this
nature
to
add
a
word
that
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
strictest
truth
chapter
xv
the
trap
extract
from
the
of
joseph
rouletabille
last
night
the
night
between
the
and
of
october
wrote
joseph
rouletabille
i
woke
up
towards
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
was
it
sleeplessness
or
noise
without
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
rang
out
with
sinister
loudness
from
the
end
of
the
park
i
rose
and
opened
the
window
cold
wind
and
rain
opaque
darkness
silence
i
reclosed
my
window
again
the
sound
of
the
cat
s
weird
cry
in
the
distance
i
partly
dressed
in
haste
the
weather
was
too
bad
for
even
a
cat
to
be
turned
out
in
it
what
did
it
mean
then
that
imitating
of
the
mewing
of
mother
angenoux
cat
so
near
the
chateau
i
seized
a
stick
the
only
weapon
i
had
and
without
making
any
noise
opened
the
door
the
gallery
into
which
i
went
was
well
lit
by
a
lamp
with
a
reflector
i
felt
a
keen
current
of
air
and
on
turning
found
the
window
open
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
gallery
which
i
call
the
gallery
to
distinguish
it
from
the
right
gallery
on
to
which
the
apartment
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
opened
these
two
galleries
cross
each
other
at
right
angles
who
had
left
that
window
open
or
who
had
come
to
open
it
i
went
to
the
window
and
leaned
out
five
feet
below
me
there
was
a
sort
of
terrace
over
the
projection
of
a
room
on
the
one
could
if
one
wanted
jump
from
the
window
on
to
the
terrace
and
allow
oneself
to
drop
from
it
into
the
court
of
the
chateau
whoever
had
entered
by
this
road
had
evidently
not
had
a
key
to
the
vestibule
door
but
why
should
i
be
thinking
of
my
previous
night
s
attempt
with
the
ladder
because
of
the
open
window
left
open
perhaps
by
the
negligence
of
a
servant
i
reclosed
it
smiling
at
the
ease
with
which
i
built
a
drama
on
the
mere
suggestion
of
an
open
window
again
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
and
then
silence
the
rain
ceased
to
beat
on
the
window
all
in
the
chateau
slept
i
walked
with
infinite
precaution
on
the
carpet
of
the
gallery
on
reaching
the
corner
of
the
right
gallery
i
peered
round
it
cautiously
there
was
another
lamp
there
with
a
reflector
which
quite
lit
up
the
several
objects
in
it
three
chairs
and
some
pictures
hanging
on
the
wall
what
was
i
doing
there
perfect
silence
reigned
throughout
everything
was
sunk
in
repose
what
was
the
instinct
that
urged
me
towards
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
why
did
a
voice
within
me
cry
go
on
to
the
chamber
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
cast
my
eyes
down
upon
the
carpet
on
which
i
was
treading
and
saw
that
my
steps
were
being
directed
towards
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
by
the
marks
of
steps
that
had
already
been
made
there
yes
on
the
carpet
were
traces
of
footsteps
stained
with
mud
leading
to
the
chamber
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
horror
horror
i
recognised
in
those
footprints
the
impression
of
the
neat
boots
of
the
murderer
he
had
come
then
from
without
in
this
wretched
night
if
you
could
descend
from
the
gallery
by
way
of
the
window
by
means
of
the
terrace
then
you
could
get
into
the
chateau
by
the
same
means
the
murderer
was
still
in
the
chateau
for
here
were
marks
as
of
returning
footsteps
he
had
entered
by
the
open
window
at
the
extremity
of
the
gallery
he
had
passed
frederic
larsan
s
door
and
mine
had
turned
to
the
right
and
had
entered
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
i
am
before
the
door
of
her
it
is
open
i
push
it
without
making
the
least
noise
under
the
door
of
the
room
itself
i
see
a
streak
of
light
i
listen
no
sound
not
even
of
breathing
ah
if
i
only
knew
what
was
passing
in
the
silence
that
is
behind
that
door
i
find
the
door
locked
and
the
key
turned
on
the
inner
side
and
the
murderer
is
there
perhaps
he
must
be
there
will
he
escape
this
time
all
depends
on
me
i
must
be
calm
and
above
all
i
must
make
no
false
steps
i
must
see
into
that
room
i
can
enter
it
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
but
to
do
that
i
should
have
to
cross
her
boudoir
and
while
i
am
there
the
murderer
may
escape
by
the
gallery
door
the
door
in
front
of
which
i
am
now
standing
i
am
sure
that
no
other
crime
is
being
committed
on
this
night
for
there
is
complete
silence
in
the
boudoir
where
two
nurses
are
taking
care
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
until
she
is
restored
to
health
as
i
am
almost
sure
that
the
murderer
is
there
why
do
i
not
at
once
give
the
alarm
the
murderer
may
perhaps
escape
but
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
save
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
life
suppose
the
murderer
on
this
occasion
is
not
here
to
murder
the
door
has
been
opened
to
allow
him
to
enter
by
whom
and
it
has
been
refastened
by
whom
mademoiselle
stangerson
shuts
herself
up
in
her
apartment
with
her
nurses
every
night
who
turned
the
key
of
that
chamber
to
allow
the
murderer
to
enter
the
nurses
two
faithful
domestics
the
old
chambermaid
sylvia
it
is
very
improbable
besides
they
slept
in
the
boudoir
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
very
nervous
and
careful
monsieur
robert
darzac
told
me
sees
to
her
own
safety
since
she
has
been
well
enough
to
move
about
in
her
room
which
i
have
not
yet
seen
her
leave
this
nervousness
and
sudden
care
on
her
part
which
had
struck
monsieur
darzac
had
given
me
also
food
for
thought
at
the
time
of
the
crime
in
the
yellow
room
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
she
expected
the
murderer
was
he
expected
this
night
was
it
she
herself
who
had
opened
her
door
to
him
had
she
some
reason
for
doing
so
was
she
obliged
to
do
it
was
it
a
meeting
for
purposes
of
crime
certainly
it
was
not
a
lover
s
meeting
for
i
believe
mademoiselle
stangerson
adores
monsieur
darzac
all
these
reflections
ran
through
my
brain
like
a
flash
of
lightning
what
would
i
not
give
to
know
it
is
possible
that
there
was
some
reason
for
the
awful
silence
my
intervention
might
do
more
harm
than
good
how
could
i
tell
how
could
i
know
i
might
not
any
moment
cause
another
crime
if
i
could
only
see
and
know
without
breaking
that
silence
i
left
the
and
descended
the
central
stairs
to
the
vestibule
and
as
silently
as
possible
made
my
way
to
the
little
room
on
the
where
daddy
jacques
had
been
sleeping
since
the
attack
made
at
the
pavilion
i
found
him
dressed
his
eyes
wide
open
almost
haggard
he
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
me
he
told
me
that
he
had
got
up
because
he
had
heard
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
and
because
he
had
heard
footsteps
in
the
park
close
to
his
window
out
of
which
he
had
looked
and
just
then
had
seen
a
black
shadow
pass
by
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
a
firearm
of
any
kind
no
he
no
longer
kept
one
since
the
examining
magistrate
had
taken
his
revolver
from
him
we
went
out
together
by
a
little
back
door
into
the
park
and
stole
along
the
chateau
to
the
point
which
is
just
below
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
window
i
placed
daddy
jacques
against
the
wall
ordering
him
not
to
stir
from
the
spot
while
i
taking
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
moon
was
hidden
by
a
cloud
moved
to
the
front
of
the
window
out
of
the
patch
of
light
which
came
from
it
for
the
window
was
if
i
could
only
know
what
was
passing
in
that
silent
chamber
i
returned
to
daddy
jacques
and
whispered
the
word
ladder
in
his
ear
at
first
i
had
thought
of
the
tree
which
a
week
ago
served
me
for
an
observatory
but
i
immediately
saw
that
from
the
way
the
window
was
i
should
not
be
able
to
see
from
that
point
of
view
anything
that
was
passing
in
the
room
and
i
wanted
not
only
to
see
but
to
hear
and
to
act
greatly
agitated
almost
trembling
daddy
jacques
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
returned
without
the
ladder
but
making
signs
to
me
with
his
arms
as
signals
to
me
to
come
quickly
to
him
when
i
got
near
him
he
gasped
come
he
led
me
round
the
château
past
the
arrived
there
he
said
i
went
to
the
donjon
in
search
of
my
ladder
and
in
the
lower
part
of
the
donjon
which
serves
me
and
the
gardener
for
a
lumber
room
i
found
the
door
open
and
the
ladder
gone
on
coming
out
that
s
what
i
caught
sight
of
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
he
pointed
to
the
further
end
of
the
chateau
where
a
ladder
stood
resting
against
the
stone
brackets
supporting
the
terrace
under
the
window
which
i
had
found
open
the
projection
of
the
terrace
had
prevented
my
seeing
it
thanks
to
that
ladder
it
was
quite
easy
to
get
into
the
gallery
of
the
first
floor
and
i
had
no
doubt
of
it
having
been
the
road
taken
by
the
unknown
we
ran
to
the
ladder
but
at
the
moment
of
reaching
it
daddy
jacques
drew
my
attention
to
the
door
of
the
little
room
situated
under
the
terrace
at
the
extremity
of
the
right
wing
of
the
chateau
having
the
terrace
for
its
roof
daddy
jacques
pushed
the
door
open
a
little
further
and
looked
in
he
s
not
there
he
whispered
who
is
not
there
the
forest
with
his
lips
once
more
to
my
ear
he
added
do
you
know
that
he
has
slept
in
the
upper
room
of
the
donjon
ever
since
it
was
restored
and
with
the
same
gesture
he
pointed
to
the
door
the
ladder
the
terrace
and
the
windows
in
the
gallery
which
a
little
while
before
i
had
what
were
my
thoughts
then
i
had
no
time
to
think
i
felt
more
than
i
thought
evidently
i
felt
if
the
is
up
there
in
the
chamber
i
say
if
because
at
this
moment
apart
from
the
presence
of
the
ladder
and
his
vacant
room
there
are
no
evidences
which
permit
me
even
to
suspect
him
if
he
is
there
he
has
been
obliged
to
pass
by
the
ladder
and
the
rooms
which
lie
behind
his
in
his
new
lodging
are
occupied
by
the
family
of
the
steward
and
by
the
cook
and
by
the
kitchens
which
bar
the
way
by
the
vestibule
to
the
interior
of
the
chateau
and
if
he
had
been
there
during
the
evening
on
any
pretext
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
go
into
the
gallery
and
see
that
the
window
could
be
simply
pushed
open
from
the
outside
this
question
of
the
unfastened
window
easily
narrowed
the
field
of
search
for
the
murderer
he
must
belong
to
the
house
unless
he
had
an
accomplice
which
i
do
not
believe
he
had
unless
unless
mademoiselle
stangerson
herself
had
seen
that
that
window
was
not
fastened
from
the
inside
but
then
what
could
be
the
frightful
secret
which
put
her
under
the
necessity
of
doing
away
with
obstacles
that
separated
her
from
the
murderer
i
seized
hold
of
the
ladder
and
we
returned
to
the
back
of
the
chateau
to
see
if
the
window
of
the
chamber
was
still
the
blind
was
drawn
but
did
not
join
and
allowed
a
bright
stream
of
light
to
escape
and
fall
upon
the
path
at
our
feet
i
planted
the
ladder
under
the
window
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
made
no
noise
and
while
daddy
jacques
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
i
mounted
it
very
quietly
my
stout
stick
in
my
hand
i
held
my
breath
and
lifted
my
feet
with
the
greatest
care
suddenly
a
heavy
cloud
discharged
itself
at
that
moment
in
a
fresh
downpour
of
rain
at
the
same
instant
the
sinister
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
arrested
me
in
my
ascent
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
come
from
close
by
me
only
a
few
yards
away
was
the
cry
a
signal
had
some
accomplice
of
the
man
seen
me
on
the
ladder
would
the
cry
bring
the
man
to
the
window
perhaps
ah
there
he
was
at
the
window
i
felt
his
head
above
me
i
heard
the
sound
of
his
breath
i
could
not
look
up
towards
him
the
least
movement
of
my
head
and
i
might
be
lost
would
he
see
me
would
he
peer
into
the
darkness
no
he
went
away
he
had
seen
nothing
i
felt
rather
than
heard
him
moving
on
in
the
room
and
i
mounted
a
few
steps
higher
my
head
reached
to
the
level
of
the
my
forehead
rose
above
it
my
eyes
looked
between
the
opening
in
the
blinds
and
i
saw
a
man
seated
at
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
little
desk
writing
his
back
was
turned
toward
me
a
candle
was
lit
before
him
and
he
bent
over
the
flame
the
light
from
it
projecting
shapeless
shadows
i
saw
nothing
but
a
monstrous
stooping
back
mademoiselle
stangerson
herself
was
not
there
her
bed
had
not
been
lain
on
where
then
was
she
sleeping
that
night
doubtless
in
the
with
her
women
perhaps
this
was
but
a
guess
i
must
content
myself
with
the
joy
of
finding
the
man
alone
i
must
be
calm
to
prepare
my
trap
but
who
then
is
this
man
writing
there
before
my
eyes
seated
at
the
desk
as
if
he
were
in
his
own
home
if
there
had
not
been
that
ladder
under
the
window
if
there
had
not
been
those
footprints
on
the
carpet
in
the
gallery
if
there
had
not
been
that
open
window
i
might
have
been
led
to
think
that
this
man
had
a
right
to
be
there
and
that
he
was
there
as
a
matter
of
course
and
for
reasons
about
which
as
yet
i
knew
nothing
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
mysterious
unknown
was
the
man
of
the
yellow
room
the
man
to
whose
murderous
assault
mademoiselle
stangerson
without
denouncing
him
had
had
to
submit
if
i
could
but
see
his
face
surprise
and
capture
him
if
i
spring
into
the
room
at
this
moment
he
will
escape
by
the
door
opening
into
the
boudoir
or
crossing
the
he
will
reach
the
gallery
and
i
shall
lose
him
i
have
him
now
and
in
five
minutes
more
he
ll
be
safer
than
if
i
had
him
in
a
what
is
he
doing
there
alone
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
what
is
he
writing
i
descend
and
place
the
ladder
on
the
ground
daddy
jacques
follows
me
we
the
chateau
i
send
daddy
jacques
to
wake
monsieur
stangerson
and
instruct
him
to
await
my
coming
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
and
to
say
nothing
definite
to
him
before
my
arrival
i
will
go
and
awaken
frederic
larsan
it
s
a
bore
to
have
to
do
it
for
i
should
have
liked
to
work
alone
and
to
have
carried
off
all
the
honors
of
this
affair
myself
right
under
the
very
nose
of
the
sleeping
detective
but
daddy
jacques
and
monsieur
stangerson
are
old
men
and
i
am
not
yet
fully
developed
i
might
not
be
strong
enough
larsan
is
used
to
wrestling
and
putting
on
the
handcuffs
he
opened
his
eyes
swollen
with
sleep
ready
to
send
me
flying
without
in
the
least
believing
in
my
reporter
s
fancies
i
had
to
assure
him
that
the
man
was
there
that
s
strange
he
said
i
thought
i
left
him
this
afternoon
in
he
dressed
himself
in
haste
and
armed
himself
with
a
revolver
we
stole
quietly
into
the
gallery
where
is
he
larsan
asked
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
she
is
not
in
let
s
go
don
t
go
there
on
the
least
alarm
the
man
will
escape
he
has
four
ways
by
which
to
do
it
the
door
the
window
the
boudoir
or
the
room
in
which
the
women
are
i
ll
draw
him
from
and
if
you
fail
if
you
only
succeed
in
wounding
him
he
ll
escape
again
without
reckoning
that
he
is
certainly
armed
no
let
me
direct
the
expedition
and
i
ll
answer
for
as
you
like
he
replied
with
fairly
good
grace
then
after
satisfying
myself
that
all
the
windows
of
the
two
galleries
were
thoroughly
secure
i
placed
frederic
larsan
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
before
the
window
which
i
had
found
open
and
had
reclosed
under
no
consideration
i
said
to
him
must
you
stir
from
this
post
till
i
call
you
the
chances
are
even
that
the
man
when
he
is
pursued
will
return
to
this
window
and
try
to
save
himself
that
way
for
it
is
by
that
way
he
came
in
and
made
a
way
ready
for
his
flight
you
have
a
dangerous
what
will
be
yours
asked
fred
i
shall
spring
into
the
room
and
knock
him
over
for
take
my
revolver
said
fred
and
i
ll
take
your
thanks
i
said
you
are
a
brave
i
accepted
his
offer
i
was
going
to
be
alone
with
the
man
in
the
room
writing
and
was
really
thankful
to
have
the
weapon
i
left
fred
having
posted
him
at
the
window
no
on
the
plan
and
with
the
greatest
precaution
went
towards
monsieur
stangerson
s
apartment
in
the
left
wing
of
the
chateau
i
found
him
with
daddy
jacques
who
had
faithfully
obeyed
my
directions
confining
himself
to
asking
his
master
to
dress
as
quickly
as
possible
in
a
few
words
i
explained
to
monsieur
stangerson
what
was
passing
he
armed
himself
with
a
revolver
followed
me
and
we
were
all
three
speedily
in
the
gallery
since
i
had
seen
the
murderer
seated
at
the
desk
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
monsieur
stangerson
wished
to
spring
upon
the
assassin
at
once
and
kill
him
i
made
him
understand
that
above
all
he
must
not
in
his
desire
to
kill
him
miss
him
when
i
had
sworn
to
him
that
his
daughter
was
not
in
the
room
and
in
no
danger
he
conquered
his
impatience
and
left
me
to
direct
the
operations
i
told
them
that
they
must
come
to
me
the
moment
i
called
to
them
or
when
i
fired
my
revolver
i
then
sent
daddy
jacques
to
place
himself
before
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
right
gallery
no
on
my
plan
i
chose
that
position
for
daddy
jacques
because
i
believed
that
the
murderer
tracked
on
leaving
the
room
would
run
through
the
gallery
towards
the
window
which
he
had
left
open
and
instantly
seeing
that
it
was
guarded
by
larsan
would
pursue
his
course
along
the
right
gallery
there
he
would
encounter
daddy
jacques
who
would
prevent
his
springing
out
of
the
window
into
the
park
under
that
window
there
was
a
sort
of
buttress
while
all
the
other
windows
in
the
galleries
were
at
such
a
height
from
the
ground
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
jump
from
them
without
breaking
one
s
neck
all
the
doors
and
windows
including
those
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
right
gallery
as
i
had
rapidly
assured
myself
were
strongly
secured
having
indicated
to
daddy
jacques
the
post
he
was
to
occupy
and
having
seen
him
take
up
his
position
i
placed
monsieur
stangerson
on
the
landing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
not
far
from
the
door
of
his
daughter
s
rather
than
the
boudoir
where
the
women
were
and
the
door
of
which
must
have
been
locked
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
herself
if
as
i
thought
she
had
taken
refuge
in
the
boudoir
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
murderer
who
was
coming
to
see
her
in
any
case
he
must
return
to
the
gallery
where
my
people
were
awaiting
him
at
every
possible
exit
on
coming
there
he
would
see
on
his
left
monsieur
stangerson
he
would
turn
to
the
right
towards
the
gallery
the
way
he
had
for
flight
where
at
the
intersection
of
the
two
galleries
he
would
see
at
once
as
i
have
explained
on
his
left
frederic
larsan
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
in
front
daddy
jacques
at
the
end
of
the
right
gallery
monsieur
stangerson
and
myself
would
arrive
by
way
of
the
back
of
the
he
is
ours
he
can
no
longer
escape
us
i
was
sure
of
that
the
plan
i
had
formed
seemed
to
me
the
best
the
surest
and
the
most
simple
it
would
no
doubt
have
been
simpler
still
if
we
had
been
able
to
place
some
one
directly
behind
the
door
of
mademoiselle
s
boudoir
which
opened
out
of
her
bedchamber
and
in
that
way
had
been
in
a
position
to
besiege
the
two
doors
of
the
room
in
which
the
man
was
but
we
could
not
penetrate
the
boudoir
except
by
way
of
the
the
door
of
which
had
been
locked
on
the
inside
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
even
if
i
had
had
the
free
disposition
of
the
boudoir
i
should
have
held
to
the
plan
i
had
formed
because
any
other
plan
of
attack
would
have
separated
us
at
the
moment
of
the
struggle
with
the
man
while
my
plan
united
us
all
for
the
attack
at
a
spot
which
i
had
selected
with
almost
mathematical
precision
the
intersection
of
the
two
galleries
having
so
placed
my
people
i
again
left
the
chateau
hurried
to
my
ladder
and
replacing
it
climbed
up
revolver
in
hand
if
there
be
any
inclined
to
smile
at
my
taking
so
many
precautionary
measures
i
refer
them
to
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
and
to
all
the
proofs
we
have
of
the
weird
cunning
of
the
murderer
further
if
there
be
some
who
think
my
observations
needlessly
minute
at
a
moment
when
they
ought
to
be
completely
held
by
rapidity
of
movement
and
decision
of
action
i
reply
that
i
have
wished
to
report
here
at
length
and
completely
all
the
details
of
a
plan
of
attack
conceived
so
rapidly
that
it
is
only
the
slowness
of
my
pen
that
gives
an
appearance
of
slowness
to
the
execution
i
have
wished
by
this
slowness
and
precision
to
be
certain
that
nothing
should
be
omitted
from
the
conditions
under
which
the
strange
phenomenon
was
produced
which
until
some
natural
explanation
of
it
is
forthcoming
seems
to
me
to
prove
even
better
than
the
theories
of
professor
stangerson
the
dissociation
of
matter
i
will
even
say
the
instantaneous
dissociation
of
chapter
xvi

from
the
of
joseph
rouletabille
continued
i
am
again
at
the
continues
rouletabille
and
once
more
i
raise
my
head
above
it
through
an
opening
in
the
curtains
the
arrangement
of
which
has
not
been
changed
i
am
ready
to
look
anxious
to
note
the
position
in
which
i
am
going
to
find
the
murderer
whether
his
back
will
still
be
turned
towards
me
whether
he
is
still
seated
at
the
desk
writing
but
perhaps
perhaps
he
is
no
longer
there
yet
how
could
he
have
fled
was
i
not
in
possession
of
his
ladder
i
force
myself
to
be
cool
i
raise
my
head
yet
higher
i
look
he
is
still
there
i
see
his
monstrous
back
deformed
by
the
shadow
thrown
by
the
candle
he
is
no
longer
writing
now
and
the
candle
is
on
the
parquet
over
which
he
is
bending
a
position
which
serves
my
purpose
i
hold
my
breath
i
mount
the
ladder
i
am
on
the
uppermost
rung
of
it
and
with
my
left
hand
seize
hold
of
the
in
this
moment
of
approaching
success
i
feel
my
heart
beating
wildly
i
put
my
revolver
between
my
teeth
a
quick
spring
and
i
shall
be
on
the
but
the
ladder
i
had
been
obliged
to
press
on
it
heavily
and
my
foot
had
scarcely
left
it
when
i
felt
it
swaying
beneath
me
it
grated
on
the
wall
and
fell
but
already
my
knees
were
touching
the
and
by
a
movement
quick
as
lightning
i
got
on
to
it
but
the
murderer
had
been
even
quicker
than
i
had
been
he
had
heard
the
grating
of
the
ladder
on
the
wall
and
i
saw
the
monstrous
back
of
the
man
raise
itself
i
saw
his
head
did
i
really
see
it
the
candle
on
the
parquet
lit
up
his
legs
only
above
the
height
of
the
table
the
chamber
was
in
darkness
i
saw
a
man
with
long
hair
a
full
beard
eyes
a
pale
face
framed
in
large
whiskers
as
well
as
i
could
distinguish
and
as
i
think
red
in
colour
i
did
not
know
the
face
that
was
in
brief
the
chief
sensation
i
received
from
that
face
in
the
dim
in
which
i
saw
it
i
did
not
know
it
or
at
least
i
did
not
recognise
it
now
for
quick
action
it
was
indeed
time
for
that
for
as
i
was
about
to
place
my
legs
through
the
window
the
man
had
seen
me
had
bounded
to
his
feet
had
sprung
as
i
foresaw
he
would
to
the
door
of
the
had
time
to
open
it
and
fled
but
i
was
already
behind
him
revolver
in
hand
shouting
help
like
an
arrow
i
crossed
the
room
but
noticed
a
letter
on
the
table
as
i
rushed
i
almost
came
up
with
the
man
in
the
for
he
had
lost
time
in
opening
the
door
to
the
gallery
i
flew
on
wings
and
in
the
gallery
was
but
a
few
feet
behind
him
he
had
taken
as
i
supposed
he
would
the
gallery
on
his
right
that
is
to
say
the
road
he
had
prepared
for
his
flight
help
jacques
help
larsan
i
cried
he
could
not
escape
us
i
raised
a
shout
of
joy
of
savage
victory
the
man
reached
the
intersection
of
the
two
galleries
hardly
two
seconds
before
me
for
the
meeting
which
i
had
prepared
the
fatal
shock
which
must
inevitably
take
place
at
that
spot
we
all
rushed
to
the
monsieur
stangerson
and
i
coming
from
one
end
of
the
right
gallery
daddy
jacques
coming
from
the
other
end
of
the
same
gallery
and
frederic
larsan
coming
from
the
gallery
the
man
was
not
there
we
looked
at
each
other
stupidly
and
with
eyes
terrified
the
man
had
vanished
like
a
ghost
where
is
he
where
is
he
we
all
asked
it
is
impossible
he
can
have
escaped
i
cried
my
terror
mastered
by
my
anger
i
touched
him
exclaimed
frederic
larsan
i
felt
his
breath
on
my
face
cried
daddy
jacques
where
is
he
where
is
he
we
all
cried
we
raced
like
madmen
along
the
two
galleries
we
visited
doors
and
windows
they
were
closed
hermetically
closed
they
had
not
been
opened
besides
the
opening
of
a
door
or
window
by
this
man
whom
we
were
hunting
without
our
having
perceived
it
would
have
been
more
inexplicable
than
his
disappearance
where
is
he
where
is
he
he
could
not
have
got
away
by
a
door
or
a
window
nor
by
any
other
way
he
could
not
have
passed
through
our
bodies
i
confess
that
for
the
moment
i
felt
done
for
the
gallery
was
perfectly
lighted
and
there
was
neither
trap
nor
secret
door
in
the
walls
nor
any
sort
of
we
moved
the
chairs
and
lifted
the
pictures
nothing
nothing
we
would
have
looked
into
a
if
there
had
been
one
to
look
into
when
this
mystery
thanks
to
rouletabille
was
naturally
explained
by
the
help
alone
of
his
masterful
mind
we
were
able
to
realise
that
the
murderer
had
got
away
neither
by
a
door
a
window
nor
the
stairs
a
fact
which
the
judges
would
not
admit
chapter
xvii
the
inexplicable
gallery
mademoiselle
stangerson
appeared
at
the
door
of
her
continues
rouletabille
s
we
were
near
her
door
in
the
gallery
where
this
incredible
phenomenon
had
taken
place
there
are
moments
when
one
feels
as
if
one
s
brain
were
about
to
burst
a
bullet
in
the
head
a
fracture
of
the
skull
the
seat
of
reason
shattered
with
only
these
can
i
compare
the
sensation
which
exhausted
and
left
me
void
of
sense
happily
mademoiselle
stangerson
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
her
i
saw
her
and
that
helped
to
relieve
my
chaotic
state
of
mind
i
breathed
her
i
inhaled
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
whom
i
should
never
see
again
i
would
have
given
ten
years
of
my
life
half
my
life
to
see
once
more
the
lady
in
black
alas
i
no
more
meet
her
but
from
time
to
time
and
yet
and
yet
how
the
memory
of
that
perfume
felt
by
me
alone
carries
me
back
to
the
days
of
my
childhood
it
was
this
sharp
reminder
from
my
beloved
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
which
made
me
go
to
her
dressed
wholly
in
white
and
so
pale
so
pale
and
so
beautiful
on
the
threshold
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
her
beautiful
golden
hair
gathered
into
a
knot
on
the
back
of
her
neck
left
visible
the
red
star
on
her
temple
which
had
so
nearly
been
the
cause
of
her
death
when
i
first
got
on
the
right
track
of
the
mystery
of
this
case
i
had
imagined
that
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
in
the
yellow
room
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
worn
her
hair
in
bands
but
then
how
could
i
have
imagined
otherwise
when
i
had
not
been
in
the
yellow
room
when
i
wrote
these
lines
joseph
rouletabille
was
eighteen
years
of
age
and
he
spoke
of
his
i
have
kept
the
text
of
my
friend
but
i
inform
the
reader
here
that
the
episode
of
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
has
no
connection
with
that
of
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
it
is
not
my
fault
if
in
the
document
which
i
have
cited
rouletabille
thought
fit
to
refer
to
his
childhood
but
now
since
the
occurrence
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
i
did
not
reason
at
all
i
stood
there
stupid
before
the
apparition
so
pale
and
so
beautiful
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
she
was
clad
in
a
of
dreamy
white
one
might
have
taken
her
to
be
a
ghost
a
lovely
phantom
her
father
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately
as
if
he
had
recovered
her
after
being
long
lost
to
him
i
dared
not
question
her
he
drew
her
into
the
room
and
we
followed
them
for
we
had
to
know
the
door
of
the
boudoir
was
open
the
terrified
faces
of
the
two
nurses
craned
towards
us
mademoiselle
stangerson
inquired
the
meaning
of
all
the
disturbance
that
she
was
not
in
her
own
room
was
quite
easily
explained
quite
easily
she
had
a
fancy
not
to
sleep
that
night
in
her
chamber
but
in
the
boudoir
with
her
nurses
locking
the
door
on
them
since
the
night
of
the
crime
she
had
experienced
feelings
of
terror
and
fears
came
over
her
that
are
easily
to
be
comprehended
but
who
could
imagine
that
on
that
particular
night
when
he
was
to
come
she
would
by
a
mere
chance
determine
to
shut
herself
in
with
her
women
who
would
think
that
she
would
act
contrary
to
her
father
s
wish
to
sleep
in
the
who
could
believe
that
the
letter
which
had
so
recently
been
on
the
table
in
her
room
would
no
longer
be
there
he
who
could
understand
all
this
would
have
to
assume
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
knew
that
the
murderer
was
coming
she
could
not
prevent
his
coming
again
unknown
to
her
father
unknown
to
all
but
to
monsieur
robert
darzac
for
he
must
know
it
now
perhaps
he
had
known
it
before
did
he
remember
that
phrase
in
the
elysee
garden
must
i
commit
a
crime
then
to
win
you
against
whom
the
crime
if
not
against
the
obstacle
against
the
murderer
ah
i
would
kill
him
with
my
own
hand
and
i
replied
you
have
not
answered
my
that
was
the
very
truth
in
truth
in
truth
monsieur
darzac
knew
the
murderer
so
well
that
while
wishing
to
kill
him
himself
he
was
afraid
i
should
find
him
there
could
be
but
two
reasons
why
he
had
assisted
me
in
my
investigation
first
because
i
forced
him
to
do
it
and
second
because
she
would
be
the
better
protected
i
am
in
the
chamber
her
room
i
look
at
her
also
at
the
place
where
the
letter
had
just
now
been
she
has
possessed
herself
of
it
it
was
evidently
intended
for
her
evidently
how
she
trembles
trembles
at
the
strange
story
her
father
is
telling
her
of
the
presence
of
the
murderer
in
her
chamber
and
of
the
pursuit
but
it
is
plainly
to
be
seen
that
she
is
not
wholly
satisfied
by
the
assurance
given
her
until
she
had
been
told
that
the
murderer
by
some
incomprehensible
means
had
been
able
to
elude
us
then
follows
a
silence
what
a
silence
we
are
all
there
looking
at
her
her
father
larsan
daddy
jacques
and
i
what
were
we
all
thinking
of
in
the
silence
after
the
events
of
that
night
of
the
mystery
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
of
the
prodigious
fact
of
the
presence
of
the
murderer
in
her
room
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
our
thoughts
might
have
been
translated
into
the
words
which
were
addressed
to
her
you
who
know
of
this
mystery
explain
it
to
us
and
we
shall
perhaps
be
able
to
save
you
how
i
longed
to
save
her
for
herself
and
from
the
other
it
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
she
is
there
shedding
about
her
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
at
last
i
see
her
in
the
silence
of
her
chamber
since
the
fatal
hour
of
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
we
have
hung
about
this
invisible
and
silent
woman
to
learn
what
she
knows
our
desires
our
wish
to
know
must
be
a
torment
to
her
who
can
tell
that
should
we
learn
the
secret
of
her
mystery
it
would
not
precipitate
a
tragedy
more
terrible
than
that
which
had
already
been
enacted
here
who
can
tell
if
it
might
not
mean
her
death
yet
it
had
brought
her
close
to
death
and
we
still
knew
nothing
or
rather
there
are
some
of
us
who
know
nothing
but
i
if
i
knew
who
i
should
know
all
who
who
not
knowing
who
i
must
remain
silent
out
of
pity
for
her
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
she
knows
how
he
escaped
from
the
yellow
room
and
yet
she
keeps
the
secret
when
i
know
who
i
will
speak
to
him
to
him
she
looked
at
us
now
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
as
if
we
were
not
in
the
chamber
monsieur
stangerson
broke
the
silence
he
declared
that
henceforth
he
would
no
more
absent
himself
from
his
daughter
s
apartments
she
tried
to
oppose
him
in
vain
he
adhered
firmly
to
his
purpose
he
would
install
himself
there
this
very
night
he
said
solely
concerned
for
the
health
of
his
daughter
he
reproached
her
for
having
left
her
bed
then
he
suddenly
began
talking
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
little
child
he
smiled
at
her
and
seemed
not
to
know
either
what
he
said
or
what
he
did
the
illustrious
professor
had
lost
his
head
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
a
tone
of
tender
distress
said
father
father
daddy
jacques
blows
his
nose
and
frederic
larsan
himself
is
obliged
to
turn
away
to
hide
his
emotion
for
myself
i
am
able
neither
to
think
or
feel
i
felt
an
infinite
contempt
for
myself
it
was
the
first
time
that
frederic
larsan
like
myself
found
himself
face
to
face
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
since
the
attack
in
the
yellow
room
like
me
he
had
insisted
on
being
allowed
to
question
the
unhappy
lady
but
he
had
not
any
more
than
had
i
been
permitted
to
him
as
to
me
the
same
answer
had
always
been
given
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
too
weak
to
receive
us
the
questionings
of
the
examining
magistrate
had
her
it
was
evidently
intended
not
to
give
us
any
assistance
in
our
researches
i
was
not
surprised
but
frederic
larsan
had
always
resented
this
conduct
it
is
true
that
he
and
i
had
a
totally
different
theory
of
the
crime
i
still
catch
myself
repeating
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
save
her
save
her
without
his
speaking
who
is
he
the
murderer
take
him
and
shut
his
mouth
but
monsieur
darzac
made
it
clear
that
in
order
to
shut
his
mouth
he
must
be
killed
have
i
the
right
to
kill
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
murderer
no
i
had
not
but
let
him
only
give
me
the
chance
let
me
find
out
whether
he
is
really
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
let
me
see
his
dead
body
since
it
can
not
be
taken
alive
if
i
could
but
make
this
woman
who
does
not
even
look
at
us
understand
she
is
absorbed
by
her
fears
and
by
her
father
s
distress
of
mind
and
i
can
do
nothing
to
save
her
yes
i
will
go
to
work
once
more
and
accomplish
wonders
i
move
towards
her
i
would
speak
to
her
i
would
entreat
her
to
have
confidence
in
me
i
would
in
a
word
make
her
understand
she
alone
that
i
know
how
the
murderer
escaped
from
the
yellow
room
that
i
have
guessed
the
motives
for
her
secrecy
and
that
i
pity
her
with
all
my
heart
but
by
her
gestures
she
begged
us
to
leave
her
alone
expressing
weariness
and
the
need
for
immediate
rest
monsieur
stangerson
asked
us
to
go
back
to
our
rooms
and
thanked
us
frederic
larsan
and
i
bowed
to
him
and
followed
by
daddy
jacques
we
regained
the
gallery
i
heard
larsan
murmur
strange
strange
he
made
a
sign
to
me
to
go
with
him
into
his
room
on
the
threshold
he
turned
towards
daddy
jacques
did
you
see
him
distinctly
he
asked
who
the
man
saw
him
why
he
had
a
big
red
beard
and
red
that
s
how
he
appeared
to
me
i
said
and
to
me
said
larsan
the
great
fred
and
i
were
alone
in
his
chamber
now
to
talk
over
this
thing
we
talked
for
an
hour
turning
the
matter
over
and
viewing
it
from
every
side
from
the
questions
put
by
him
from
the
explanation
which
he
gives
me
it
is
clear
to
me
that
in
spite
of
all
our
senses
he
is
persuaded
the
man
disappeared
by
some
secret
passage
in
the
chateau
known
to
him
alone
he
knows
the
chateau
he
said
to
me
he
knows
it
he
is
a
rather
tall
man
i
suggested
he
is
as
tall
as
he
wants
to
be
murmured
fred
i
understand
i
said
but
how
do
you
account
for
his
red
hair
and
beard
too
much
beard
too
much
hair
false
says
fred
that
s
easily
said
you
are
always
thinking
of
robert
darzac
you
can
t
get
rid
of
that
idea
i
am
certain
that
he
is
so
much
the
better
i
hope
so
but
everything
condemns
him
did
you
notice
the
marks
on
the
carpet
come
and
look
at
i
have
seen
them
they
are
the
marks
of
the
neat
boots
the
same
as
those
we
saw
on
the
border
of
the
can
you
deny
that
they
belong
to
robert
darzac
of
course
one
may
be
have
you
noticed
that
those
footprints
only
go
in
one
direction
that
there
are
no
return
marks
when
the
man
came
from
the
chamber
pursued
by
all
of
us
his
footsteps
left
no
traces
behind
he
had
perhaps
been
in
the
chamber
for
hours
the
mud
from
his
boots
had
dried
and
he
moved
with
such
rapidity
on
the
points
of
his
toes
we
saw
him
running
but
we
did
not
hear
his
i
suddenly
put
an
end
to
this
idle
chatter
void
of
any
logic
and
made
a
sign
to
larsan
to
listen
there
below
some
one
is
shutting
a
i
rise
larsan
follows
me
we
descend
to
the
of
the
chateau
i
lead
him
to
the
little
room
under
the
terrace
beneath
the
window
of
the
gallery
i
point
to
the
door
now
closed
open
a
short
time
before
under
which
a
shaft
of
light
is
visible
the
says
fred
come
on
i
whisper
prepared
i
know
not
why
to
believe
that
the
keeper
is
the
guilty
man
i
go
to
the
door
and
rap
smartly
on
it
some
might
think
that
we
were
rather
late
in
thinking
of
the
keeper
since
our
first
business
after
having
found
that
the
murderer
had
escaped
us
in
the
gallery
ought
to
have
been
to
search
everywhere
else
around
the
chateau
in
the
park
had
this
criticism
been
made
at
the
time
we
could
only
have
answered
that
the
assassin
had
disappeared
from
the
gallery
in
such
a
way
that
we
thought
he
was
no
longer
anywhere
he
had
eluded
us
when
we
all
had
our
hands
stretched
out
ready
to
seize
him
when
we
were
almost
touching
him
we
had
no
longer
any
ground
for
hoping
that
we
could
clear
up
the
mystery
of
that
night
as
soon
as
i
rapped
at
the
door
it
was
opened
and
the
keeper
asked
us
quietly
what
we
wanted
he
was
undressed
and
preparing
to
go
to
bed
the
bed
had
not
yet
been
disturbed
we
entered
and
i
affected
surprise
not
gone
to
bed
yet
no
he
replied
roughly
i
have
been
making
a
round
of
the
park
and
in
the
woods
i
am
only
just
back
and
sleepy
listen
i
said
an
hour
or
so
ago
there
was
a
ladder
close
by
your
what
ladder
i
did
not
see
any
ladder
and
he
simply
put
us
out
of
the
room
when
we
were
outside
i
looked
at
larsan
his
face
was
impenetrable
well
i
said
well
he
repeated
does
that
open
out
any
new
view
to
you
there
was
no
mistaking
larsan
s
bad
temper
on
the
chateau
i
heard
him
mutter
it
would
be
strange
very
strange
if
i
had
deceived
myself
on
that
point
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
me
rather
than
to
himself
he
added
in
any
case
we
shall
soon
know
what
to
think
the
morning
will
bring
light
with
chapter
xviii
rouletabille
has
drawn
a
circle
between
the
two
bumps
on
his
forehead
extract
from
the
of
joseph
rouletabille
continued
we
separated
on
the
thresholds
of
our
rooms
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
hands
i
was
glad
to
have
aroused
in
him
a
suspicion
of
error
his
was
an
original
brain
very
intelligent
but
without
method
i
did
not
go
to
bed
i
awaited
the
coming
of
daylight
and
then
went
down
to
the
front
of
the
chateau
and
made
a
detour
examining
every
trace
of
footsteps
coming
towards
it
or
going
from
it
these
however
were
so
mixed
and
confusing
that
i
could
make
nothing
of
them
here
i
may
make
a
remark
i
am
not
accustomed
to
attach
an
exaggerated
importance
to
exterior
signs
left
in
the
track
of
a
crime
the
method
which
traces
the
criminal
by
means
of
the
tracks
of
his
footsteps
is
altogether
primitive
so
many
footprints
are
identical
however
in
the
disturbed
state
of
my
mind
i
did
go
into
the
deserted
court
and
did
look
at
all
the
footprints
i
could
find
there
seeking
for
some
indication
as
a
basis
for
reasoning
if
i
could
but
find
a
right
in
despair
i
seated
myself
on
a
stone
for
over
an
hour
i
busied
myself
with
the
common
ordinary
work
of
a
policeman
like
the
least
intelligent
of
detectives
i
went
on
blindly
over
the
traces
of
footprints
which
told
me
just
no
more
than
they
could
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
a
fool
lower
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
than
even
the
police
of
the
modern
romancer
novelists
build
mountains
of
stupidity
out
of
a
footprint
on
the
sand
or
from
an
impression
of
a
hand
on
the
wall
that
s
the
way
innocent
men
are
brought
to
prison
it
might
convince
an
examining
magistrate
or
the
head
of
a
detective
department
but
it
s
not
proof
you
writers
forget
that
what
the
senses
furnish
is
not
proof
if
i
am
taking
cognisance
of
what
is
offered
me
by
my
senses
i
do
so
but
to
bring
the
results
within
the
circle
of
my
reason
that
circle
may
be
the
most
circumscribed
but
if
it
is
it
has
this
advantage
it
holds
nothing
but
the
truth
yes
i
swear
that
i
have
never
used
the
evidence
of
the
senses
but
as
servants
to
my
reason
i
have
never
permitted
them
to
become
my
master
they
have
not
made
of
me
that
monstrous
thing
worse
than
a
blind
man
a
man
who
sees
falsely
and
that
is
why
i
can
triumph
over
your
error
and
your
merely
animal
intelligence
frederic
larsan
be
of
good
courage
then
friend
rouletabille
it
is
impossible
that
the
incident
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
should
be
outside
the
circle
of
your
reason
you
know
that
then
have
faith
and
take
thought
with
yourself
and
forget
not
that
you
took
hold
of
the
right
end
when
you
drew
that
circle
in
your
brain
within
which
to
unravel
this
mysterious
play
of
circumstance
to
it
once
again
go
back
to
the
gallery
take
your
stand
on
your
reason
and
rest
there
as
frederic
larsan
rests
on
his
cane
you
will
then
soon
prove
that
the
great
fred
is
nothing
but
a
fool
october
noon
joseph
i
acted
as
i
planned
with
head
on
fire
i
retraced
my
way
to
the
gallery
and
without
having
found
anything
more
than
i
had
seen
on
the
previous
night
the
right
hold
i
had
taken
of
my
reason
drew
me
to
something
so
important
that
i
was
obliged
to
cling
to
it
to
save
myself
from
falling
now
for
the
strength
and
patience
to
find
sensible
traces
to
fit
in
with
my
thinking
and
these
must
come
within
the
circle
i
have
drawn
between
the
two
bumps
on
my
forehead
of
october
joseph
chapter
xix
rouletabille
invites
me
to
breakfast
at
the
donjon
inn
it
was
not
until
later
that
rouletabille
sent
me
the
in
which
he
had
written
at
length
the
story
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
on
the
day
i
arrived
at
the
glandier
and
joined
him
in
his
room
he
recounted
to
me
with
the
greatest
detail
all
that
i
have
now
related
telling
me
also
how
he
had
spent
several
hours
in
paris
where
he
had
learned
nothing
that
could
be
of
any
help
to
him
the
event
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
had
occurred
on
the
night
between
the
and
of
october
that
is
to
say
three
days
before
my
return
to
the
chateau
it
was
on
the
of
november
then
that
i
went
back
to
the
glandier
summoned
there
by
my
friend
s
telegram
and
taking
the
revolvers
with
me
i
am
now
in
rouletabille
s
room
and
he
has
finished
his
recital
while
he
had
been
telling
me
the
story
i
noticed
him
continually
rubbing
the
glass
of
the
eyeglasses
he
had
found
on
the
side
table
from
the
evident
pleasure
he
was
taking
in
handling
them
i
felt
they
must
be
one
of
those
sensible
evidences
destined
to
enter
what
he
had
called
the
circle
of
the
right
end
of
his
reason
that
strange
and
unique
way
of
his
to
express
himself
in
terms
wonderfully
adequate
for
his
thoughts
no
longer
surprised
me
it
was
often
necessary
to
know
his
thought
to
understand
the
terms
he
used
and
it
was
not
easy
to
penetrate
into
rouletabille
s
thinking
this
lad
s
brain
was
one
of
the
most
curious
things
i
have
ever
observed
rouletabille
went
on
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
without
suspecting
the
astonishment
and
even
bewilderment
he
roused
in
others
i
am
sure
he
was
not
himself
in
the
least
conscious
of
the
originality
of
his
genius
he
was
himself
and
at
ease
wherever
he
happened
to
be
when
he
had
finished
his
recital
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
it
i
replied
that
i
was
much
puzzled
by
his
question
then
he
begged
me
to
try
in
my
turn
to
take
my
reason
in
hand
by
the
right
very
well
i
said
it
seems
to
me
that
the
point
of
departure
of
my
reason
would
be
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
murderer
you
pursued
was
in
the
i
paused
after
making
so
good
a
start
you
ought
not
to
stop
so
soon
he
exclaimed
come
make
another
i
ll
try
since
he
disappeared
from
the
gallery
without
passing
through
any
door
or
window
he
must
have
escaped
by
some
other
rouletabille
looked
at
me
pityingly
smiled
carelessly
and
remarked
that
i
was
reasoning
like
a
postman
or
like
frederic
larsan
rouletabille
had
alternate
fits
of
admiration
and
disdain
for
the
great
fred
it
all
depended
as
to
whether
larsan
s
discoveries
tallied
with
rouletabille
s
reasoning
or
not
when
they
did
he
would
exclaim
he
is
really
great
when
they
did
not
he
would
grunt
and
mutter
what
an
ass
it
was
a
petty
side
of
the
noble
character
of
this
strange
youth
we
had
risen
and
he
led
me
into
the
park
when
we
reached
the
court
and
were
making
towards
the
gate
the
sound
of
blinds
thrown
back
against
the
wall
made
us
turn
our
heads
and
we
saw
at
a
window
on
the
first
floor
of
the
chateau
the
ruddy
and
clean
shaven
face
of
a
person
i
did
not
recognise
hullo
muttered
rouletabille
arthur
rance
he
lowered
his
head
quickened
his
pace
and
i
heard
him
ask
himself
between
his
teeth
was
he
in
the
chateau
that
night
what
is
he
doing
here
we
had
gone
some
distance
from
the
chateau
when
i
asked
him
who
this
arthur
rance
was
and
how
he
had
come
to
know
him
he
referred
to
his
story
of
that
morning
and
i
remembered
that
arthur
rance
was
the
american
from
philadelphia
with
whom
he
had
had
so
many
drinks
at
the
elysee
reception
but
was
he
not
to
have
left
france
almost
immediately
i
asked
no
doubt
that
s
why
i
am
surprised
to
find
him
here
still
and
not
only
in
france
but
above
all
at
the
glandier
he
did
not
arrive
this
morning
and
he
did
not
get
here
last
night
he
must
have
got
here
before
dinner
then
why
didn
t
the
concierges
tell
me
i
reminded
my
friend
apropos
of
the
concierges
that
he
had
not
yet
told
me
what
had
led
him
to
get
them
set
at
liberty
we
were
close
to
their
lodge
monsieur
and
madame
bernier
saw
us
coming
a
frank
smile
lit
up
their
happy
faces
they
seemed
to
harbour
no
because
of
their
detention
my
young
friend
asked
them
at
what
hour
arthur
rance
had
arrived
they
answered
that
they
did
not
know
he
was
at
the
chateau
he
must
have
come
during
the
evening
of
the
previous
night
but
they
had
not
had
to
open
the
gate
for
him
because
being
a
great
walker
and
not
wishing
that
a
carriage
should
be
sent
to
meet
him
he
was
accustomed
to
get
off
at
the
little
hamlet
of
from
which
he
came
to
the
chateau
by
way
of
the
forest
he
reached
the
park
by
the
grotto
of
over
the
little
gate
of
which
giving
on
to
the
park
he
climbed
as
the
concierges
spoke
i
saw
rouletabille
s
face
cloud
over
and
exhibit
disappointment
a
disappointment
no
doubt
with
himself
evidently
he
was
a
little
vexed
after
having
worked
so
much
on
the
spot
with
so
minute
a
study
of
the
people
and
events
at
the
glandier
that
he
had
to
learn
now
that
arthur
rance
was
accustomed
to
visit
the
chateau
you
say
that
monsieur
arthur
rance
is
accustomed
to
come
to
the
chateau
when
did
he
come
here
last
we
can
t
tell
you
exactly
replied
madame
bernier
that
was
the
name
of
the
concierge
we
couldn
t
know
while
they
were
keeping
us
in
prison
besides
as
the
gentleman
comes
to
the
chateau
without
passing
through
our
gate
he
goes
away
by
the
way
he
do
you
know
when
he
came
the
first
time
oh
yes
monsieur
nine
years
he
was
in
france
nine
years
ago
then
said
rouletabille
and
since
that
time
as
far
as
you
know
how
many
times
has
he
been
at
the
glandier
three
when
did
he
come
the
last
time
as
far
as
you
know
a
week
before
the
attempt
in
the
yellow
room
rouletabille
put
another
question
this
time
addressing
himself
particularly
to
the
woman
in
the
grove
of
the
parquet
in
the
grove
of
the
parquet
she
replied
thanks
said
rouletabille
be
ready
for
me
this
he
spoke
the
last
words
with
a
finger
on
his
lips
as
if
to
command
silence
and
discretion
we
left
the
park
and
took
the
way
to
the
donjon
inn
do
you
often
eat
here
but
you
also
take
your
meals
at
the
chateau
yes
larsan
and
i
are
sometimes
served
in
one
of
our
hasn
t
monsieur
stangerson
ever
invited
you
to
his
own
table
does
your
presence
at
the
chateau
displease
him
i
don
t
know
but
in
any
case
he
does
not
make
us
feel
that
we
are
in
his
doesn
t
he
question
you
never
he
is
in
the
same
state
of
mind
as
he
was
in
at
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
when
his
daughter
was
being
murdered
and
when
he
broke
open
the
door
and
did
not
find
the
murderer
he
is
persuaded
since
he
could
discover
nothing
that
there
s
no
reason
why
we
should
be
able
to
discover
more
than
he
did
but
he
has
made
it
his
duty
since
larsan
expressed
his
theory
not
to
oppose
rouletabille
buried
himself
in
thought
again
for
some
time
he
aroused
himself
later
to
tell
me
of
how
he
came
to
set
the
two
concierges
free
i
went
recently
to
see
monsieur
stangerson
and
took
with
me
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
was
written
i
promise
whatever
others
may
say
to
keep
in
my
service
my
two
faithful
servants
bernier
and
his
i
explained
to
him
that
by
signing
that
document
he
would
enable
me
to
compel
those
two
people
to
speak
out
and
i
declared
my
own
assurance
of
their
innocence
of
any
part
in
the
crime
that
was
also
his
opinion
the
examining
magistrate
after
it
was
signed
presented
the
document
to
the
berniers
who
then
did
speak
they
said
what
i
was
certain
they
would
say
as
soon
as
they
were
sure
they
would
not
lose
their
place
they
confessed
to
poaching
on
monsieur
stangerson
s
estates
and
it
was
while
they
were
poaching
on
the
night
of
the
crime
that
they
were
found
not
far
from
the
pavilion
at
the
moment
when
the
outrage
was
being
committed
some
rabbits
they
caught
in
that
way
were
sold
by
them
to
the
landlord
of
the
donjon
inn
who
served
them
to
his
customers
or
sent
them
to
paris
that
was
the
truth
as
i
had
guessed
from
the
first
do
you
remember
what
i
said
on
entering
the
donjon
inn
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
meat
now
i
had
heard
the
words
on
the
same
morning
when
we
arrived
at
the
park
gate
you
heard
them
also
but
you
did
not
attach
any
importance
to
them
you
recollect
when
we
reached
the
park
gate
that
we
stopped
to
look
at
a
man
who
was
running
by
the
side
of
the
wall
looking
every
minute
at
his
watch
that
was
larsan
well
behind
us
the
landlord
of
the
donjon
inn
standing
on
his
doorstep
said
to
someone
inside
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
meat
why
that
now
when
you
are
as
i
am
in
search
of
some
hidden
secret
you
can
t
afford
to
have
anything
escape
you
you
ve
got
to
know
the
meaning
of
everything
we
had
come
into
a
rather
part
of
the
country
which
had
been
turned
by
a
crime
and
my
reason
led
me
to
suspect
every
phrase
that
could
bear
upon
the
event
of
the
day
now
i
took
to
mean
since
the
in
the
course
of
my
inquiry
therefore
i
sought
to
find
a
relation
between
that
phrase
and
the
tragedy
we
went
to
the
donjon
inn
for
breakfast
i
repeated
the
phrase
and
saw
by
the
surprise
and
trouble
on
daddy
mathieu
s
face
that
i
had
not
exaggerated
its
importance
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
i
had
just
learned
that
the
concierges
had
been
arrested
daddy
mathieu
spoke
of
them
as
of
dear
friends
people
for
whom
one
is
sorry
that
was
a
reckless
conjunction
of
ideas
i
said
to
myself
now
that
the
concierges
are
arrested
we
shall
have
to
eat
red
no
more
concierges
no
more
game
the
hatred
expressed
by
daddy
mathieu
for
monsieur
stangerson
s
a
hatred
he
pretended
was
shared
by
the
concierges
led
me
easily
to
think
of
poaching
now
as
all
the
evidence
showed
the
concierges
had
not
been
in
bed
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
why
were
they
abroad
that
night
as
participants
in
the
crime
i
was
not
disposed
to
think
so
i
had
already
arrived
at
the
conclusion
by
steps
of
which
i
will
tell
you
later
that
the
assassin
had
had
no
accomplice
and
that
the
tragedy
held
a
mystery
between
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
the
murderer
a
mystery
with
which
the
concierges
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
theory
in
my
mind
i
searched
for
proof
in
their
lodge
which
as
you
know
i
entered
i
found
there
under
their
bed
some
springs
and
brass
wire
ah
i
thought
these
things
explain
why
they
were
out
in
the
park
at
night
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
dogged
silence
they
maintained
before
the
examining
magistrate
even
under
the
accusation
so
grave
as
that
of
being
accomplices
in
the
crime
poaching
would
save
them
from
the
assize
court
but
it
would
lose
them
their
places
and
as
they
were
perfectly
sure
of
their
innocence
of
the
crime
they
hoped
it
would
soon
be
established
and
then
their
poaching
might
go
on
as
usual
they
could
always
confess
later
i
however
hastened
their
confession
by
means
of
the
document
monsieur
stangerson
signed
they
gave
all
the
necessary
proofs
were
set
at
liberty
and
have
now
a
lively
gratitude
for
me
why
did
i
not
get
them
released
sooner
because
i
was
not
sure
that
nothing
more
than
poaching
was
against
them
i
wanted
to
study
the
ground
as
the
days
went
by
my
conviction
became
more
and
more
certain
the
day
after
the
events
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
i
had
need
of
help
i
could
rely
on
so
i
resolved
to
have
them
released
at
that
was
how
joseph
rouletabille
explained
himself
once
more
i
could
not
but
be
astonished
at
the
simplicity
of
the
reasoning
which
had
brought
him
to
the
truth
of
the
matter
certainly
this
was
no
big
thing
but
i
think
myself
that
the
young
man
will
one
of
these
days
explain
with
the
same
simplicity
the
fearful
tragedy
in
the
yellow
room
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
we
reached
the
donjon
inn
and
entered
it
this
time
we
did
not
see
the
landlord
but
were
received
with
a
pleasant
smile
by
the
hostess
i
have
already
described
the
room
in
which
we
found
ourselves
and
i
have
given
a
glimpse
of
the
charming
blonde
woman
with
the
gentle
eyes
who
now
immediately
began
to
prepare
our
breakfast
how
s
daddy
mathieu
asked
rouletabille
not
much
better
not
much
better
he
is
still
confined
to
his
his
rheumatism
still
sticks
to
him
then
yes
last
night
i
was
again
obliged
to
give
him
morphine
the
only
drug
that
gives
him
any
she
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
everything
about
her
expressed
gentleness
she
was
indeed
a
beautiful
woman
somewhat
with
an
air
of
indolence
with
great
eyes
seemingly
black
and
blue
amorous
eyes
was
she
happy
with
her
crabbed
rheumatic
husband
the
scene
at
which
we
had
once
been
present
did
not
lead
us
to
believe
that
she
was
yet
there
was
something
in
her
bearing
that
was
not
suggestive
of
despair
she
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
to
prepare
our
repast
leaving
on
the
table
a
bottle
of
excellent
cider
rouletabille
filled
our
earthenware
mugs
loaded
his
pipe
and
quietly
explained
to
me
his
reason
for
asking
me
to
come
to
the
glandier
with
revolvers
yes
he
said
contemplatively
looking
at
the
clouds
of
smoke
he
was
puffing
out
yes
my
dear
boy
i
expect
the
assassin
a
brief
silence
followed
which
i
took
care
not
to
interrupt
and
then
he
went
on
last
night
just
as
i
was
going
to
bed
monsieur
robert
darzac
knocked
at
my
room
when
he
came
in
he
confided
to
me
that
he
was
compelled
to
go
to
paris
the
next
day
that
is
this
morning
the
reason
which
made
this
journey
necessary
was
at
once
peremptory
and
mysterious
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
explain
its
object
to
me
i
go
and
yet
he
added
i
would
give
my
life
not
to
leave
mademoiselle
stangerson
at
this
he
did
not
try
to
hide
that
he
believed
her
to
be
once
more
in
danger
it
will
not
greatly
astonish
me
if
something
happens
night
he
avowed
and
yet
i
must
be
absent
i
can
not
be
back
at
the
glandier
before
the
morning
of
the
day
after
i
asked
him
to
explain
himself
and
this
is
all
he
would
tell
me
his
anticipation
of
coming
danger
had
come
to
him
solely
from
the
coincidence
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
been
twice
attacked
and
both
times
when
he
had
been
absent
on
the
night
of
the
incident
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
he
had
been
obliged
to
be
away
from
the
glandier
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
in
the
yellow
room
he
had
also
not
been
able
to
be
at
the
glandier
though
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
declared
himself
on
the
matter
now
a
man
so
moved
who
would
still
go
away
must
be
acting
under
compulsion
must
be
obeying
a
will
stronger
than
his
own
that
was
how
i
reasoned
and
i
told
him
so
he
replied
i
asked
him
if
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
compelling
him
he
protested
that
she
was
not
his
determination
to
go
to
paris
had
been
taken
without
any
conference
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
to
cut
the
story
short
he
repeated
that
his
belief
in
the
possibility
of
a
fresh
attack
was
founded
entirely
on
the
extraordinary
coincidence
if
anything
happens
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
said
it
would
be
terrible
for
both
of
us
for
her
because
her
life
would
be
in
danger
for
me
because
i
could
neither
defend
her
from
the
attack
nor
tell
of
where
i
had
been
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
suspicions
cast
on
me
the
examining
magistrate
and
monsieur
larsan
are
both
on
the
point
of
believing
in
my
guilt
larsan
tracked
me
the
last
time
i
went
to
paris
and
i
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
get
rid
of
why
do
you
not
tell
me
the
name
of
the
murderer
now
if
you
know
it
i
cried
monsieur
darzac
appeared
extremely
troubled
by
my
question
and
replied
to
me
in
a
hesitating
tone
i
i
know
the
name
of
the
murderer
why
how
could
i
know
his
name
i
at
once
replied
from
mademoiselle
he
grew
so
pale
that
i
thought
he
was
about
to
faint
and
i
saw
that
i
had
hit
the
nail
right
on
the
head
mademoiselle
and
he
knew
the
name
of
the
murderer
when
he
recovered
himself
he
said
to
me
i
am
going
to
leave
you
since
you
have
been
here
i
have
appreciated
your
exceptional
intelligence
and
your
unequalled
ingenuity
but
i
ask
this
service
of
you
perhaps
i
am
wrong
to
fear
an
attack
during
the
coming
night
but
as
i
must
act
with
foresight
i
count
on
you
to
frustrate
any
attempt
that
may
be
made
take
every
step
needful
to
protect
mademoiselle
stangerson
keep
a
most
careful
watch
of
her
room
don
t
go
to
sleep
nor
allow
yourself
one
moment
of
repose
the
man
we
dread
is
remarkably
cunning
with
a
cunning
that
has
never
been
equalled
if
you
keep
watch
his
very
cunning
may
save
her
because
it
s
impossible
that
he
should
not
know
that
you
are
watching
and
knowing
it
he
may
not
have
you
spoken
of
all
this
to
monsieur
stangerson
no
i
do
not
wish
him
to
ask
me
as
you
just
now
did
for
the
name
of
the
murderer
i
tell
you
all
this
monsieur
rouletabille
because
i
have
great
very
great
confidence
in
you
i
know
that
you
do
not
suspect
the
poor
man
spoke
in
jerks
he
was
evidently
suffering
i
pitied
him
the
more
because
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
rather
allow
himself
to
be
killed
than
tell
me
who
the
murderer
was
as
for
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
felt
that
she
would
rather
allow
herself
to
be
murdered
than
denounce
the
man
of
the
yellow
room
and
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
the
man
must
be
dominating
her
or
both
by
some
inscrutable
power
they
were
dreading
nothing
so
much
as
the
chance
of
monsieur
stangerson
knowing
that
his
daughter
was
held
by
her
assailant
i
made
monsieur
darzac
understand
that
he
had
explained
himself
sufficiently
and
that
he
might
refrain
from
telling
me
any
more
than
he
had
already
told
me
i
promised
him
to
watch
through
the
night
he
insisted
that
i
should
establish
an
absolutely
impassable
barrier
around
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
around
the
boudoir
where
the
nurses
were
sleeping
and
around
the
where
since
the
affair
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
monsieur
stangerson
had
slept
in
short
i
was
to
put
a
cordon
round
the
whole
apartment
from
his
insistence
i
gathered
that
monsieur
darzac
intended
not
only
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
expected
man
to
reach
the
chamber
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
to
make
that
impossibility
so
visibly
clear
that
seeing
himself
expected
he
would
at
once
go
away
that
was
how
i
interpreted
his
final
words
when
we
parted
you
may
mention
your
suspicions
of
the
expected
attack
to
monsieur
stangerson
to
daddy
jacques
to
frederic
larsan
and
to
anybody
in
the
the
poor
fellow
left
me
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
my
silence
and
my
eyes
told
him
that
i
had
guessed
a
large
part
of
his
secret
and
indeed
he
must
have
been
at
his
wits
end
to
have
come
to
me
at
such
a
time
and
to
abandon
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
spite
of
his
fixed
idea
as
to
the
consequence
when
he
was
gone
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
have
to
use
even
a
greater
cunning
than
his
so
that
if
the
man
should
come
that
night
he
might
not
for
a
moment
suspect
that
his
coming
had
been
expected
certainly
i
would
allow
him
to
get
in
far
enough
so
that
dead
or
alive
i
might
see
his
face
clearly
he
must
be
got
rid
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
must
be
freed
from
this
continual
impending
danger
yes
my
boy
said
rouletabille
after
placing
his
pipe
on
the
table
and
emptying
his
mug
of
cider
i
must
see
his
face
distinctly
so
as
to
make
sure
to
impress
it
on
that
part
of
my
brain
where
i
have
drawn
my
circle
of
the
landlady
at
that
moment
bringing
in
the
traditional
bacon
omelette
rouletabille
chaffed
her
a
little
and
she
took
the
chaff
with
the
most
charming
good
humour
she
is
much
jollier
when
daddy
mathieu
is
in
bed
with
his
rheumatism
rouletabille
said
to
me
but
i
had
eyes
neither
for
rouletabille
nor
for
the
landlady
s
smiles
i
was
entirely
absorbed
over
the
last
words
of
my
young
friend
and
in
thinking
over
monsieur
robert
darzac
s
strange
behaviour
when
he
had
finished
his
omelette
and
we
were
again
alone
rouletabille
continued
the
tale
of
his
confidences
when
i
sent
you
my
telegram
this
morning
he
said
i
had
only
the
word
of
monsieur
darzac
that
perhaps
the
assassin
would
come
i
can
now
say
that
he
will
certainly
come
i
expect
what
has
made
you
feel
this
certainty
i
have
been
sure
since
ten
o
clock
this
morning
that
he
would
come
i
knew
that
before
we
saw
arthur
rance
at
the
window
in
the
ah
i
said
but
again
what
made
you
so
sure
and
why
since
ten
this
morning
because
at
ten
i
had
proof
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
making
as
many
efforts
to
permit
of
the
murderer
s
entrance
as
monsieur
robert
darzac
had
taken
precautions
against
is
that
possible
i
cried
haven
t
you
told
me
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
loves
monsieur
robert
darzac
i
told
you
so
because
it
is
the
then
do
you
see
nothing
strange
everything
in
this
business
is
strange
my
friend
but
take
my
word
for
it
the
strangeness
you
now
feel
is
nothing
to
the
strangeness
that
s
to
come
it
must
be
admitted
then
i
said
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
her
murderer
are
in
communication
at
any
rate
in
writing
admit
it
my
friend
admit
it
you
don
t
risk
anything
i
told
you
about
the
letter
left
on
her
table
on
the
night
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
affair
the
letter
that
disappeared
into
the
pocket
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
why
should
it
not
have
been
a
summons
to
a
meeting
might
he
not
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
of
darzac
s
absence
appoint
the
meeting
for
the
coming
night
and
my
friend
laughed
silently
there
are
moments
when
i
ask
myself
if
he
is
not
laughing
at
me
the
door
of
the
inn
opened
rouletabille
was
on
his
feet
so
suddenly
that
one
might
have
thought
he
had
received
an
electric
shock
mr
arthur
rance
he
cried
arthur
rance
stood
before
us
calmly
bowing
chapter
xx
an
act
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
you
remember
me
monsieur
asked
rouletabille
perfectly
replied
arthur
rance
i
recognise
you
as
the
lad
at
the
bar
the
face
of
rouletabille
crimsoned
at
being
called
a
i
want
to
shake
hands
with
you
you
are
a
bright
little
the
american
extended
his
hand
and
rouletabille
relaxing
his
frown
shook
it
and
introduced
arthur
rance
to
me
he
invited
him
to
share
our
meal
no
thanks
i
breakfasted
with
monsieur
arthur
rance
spoke
french
perfectly
almost
without
an
accent
i
did
not
expect
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
monsieur
i
thought
you
were
to
have
left
france
the
day
after
the
reception
at
the
rouletabille
and
i
outwardly
indifferent
listened
most
intently
for
every
word
the
american
would
say
the
man
s
purplish
red
face
his
heavy
eyelids
the
nervous
twitchings
all
spoke
of
his
addiction
to
drink
how
came
it
that
so
sorry
a
specimen
of
a
man
should
be
so
intimate
with
monsieur
stangerson
some
days
later
i
learned
from
frederic
larsan
who
like
ourselves
was
surprised
and
mystified
by
his
appearance
and
reception
at
the
chateau
that
rance
had
been
an
inebriate
for
only
about
fifteen
years
that
is
to
say
since
the
professor
and
his
daughter
left
philadelphia
during
the
time
the
stangersons
lived
in
america
they
were
very
intimate
with
arthur
rance
who
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
phrenologists
of
the
new
world
owing
to
new
experiments
he
had
made
enormous
strides
beyond
the
science
of
gall
and
lavater
the
friendliness
with
which
he
was
received
at
the
glandier
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
had
once
rendered
mademoiselle
stangerson
a
great
service
by
stopping
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
the
runaway
horses
of
her
carriage
the
immediate
result
of
that
could
however
have
been
no
more
than
a
mere
friendly
association
with
the
stangersons
certainly
not
a
love
affair
frederic
larsan
did
not
tell
me
where
he
had
picked
up
this
information
but
he
appeared
to
be
quite
sure
of
what
he
said
had
we
known
these
facts
at
the
time
arthur
rance
met
us
at
the
donjon
inn
his
presence
at
the
chateau
might
not
have
puzzled
us
but
they
could
not
have
failed
to
increase
our
interest
in
the
man
himself
the
american
must
have
been
at
least
years
old
he
spoke
in
a
perfectly
natural
tone
in
reply
to
rouletabille
s
question
i
put
off
my
return
to
america
when
i
heard
of
the
attack
on
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
wanted
to
be
certain
the
lady
had
not
been
killed
and
i
shall
not
go
away
until
she
is
perfectly
arthur
rance
then
took
the
lead
in
talk
paying
no
heed
to
some
of
rouletabille
s
questions
he
gave
us
without
our
inviting
him
his
personal
views
on
the
subject
of
the
tragedy
views
which
as
well
as
i
could
make
out
were
not
far
from
those
held
by
frederic
larzan
the
american
also
thought
that
robert
darzac
had
something
to
do
with
the
matter
he
did
not
mention
him
by
name
but
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
whom
he
meant
he
told
us
he
was
aware
of
the
efforts
young
rouletabille
was
making
to
unravel
the
tangled
skein
of
the
yellow
room
mystery
he
explained
that
monsieur
stangerson
had
related
to
him
all
that
had
taken
place
in
the
inexplicable
gallery
he
several
times
expressed
his
regret
at
monsieur
darzac
s
absence
from
the
chateau
on
all
these
occasions
and
thought
that
monsieur
darzac
had
done
cleverly
in
allying
himself
with
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
who
could
not
fail
sooner
or
later
to
discover
the
murderer
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
with
unconcealed
irony
then
he
rose
bowed
to
us
and
left
the
inn
rouletabille
watched
him
through
the
window
an
odd
fish
that
he
said
do
you
think
he
ll
pass
the
night
at
the
glandier
i
asked
to
my
amazement
the
young
reporter
answered
that
it
was
a
matter
of
entire
indifference
to
him
whether
he
did
or
not
as
to
how
we
spent
our
time
during
the
afternoon
all
i
need
say
is
that
rouletabille
led
me
to
the
grotto
of
and
all
the
time
talked
of
every
subject
but
the
one
in
which
we
were
most
interested
towards
evening
i
was
surprised
to
find
rouletabille
making
none
of
the
preparations
i
had
expected
him
to
make
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
when
night
had
come
on
and
we
were
once
more
in
his
room
he
replied
that
all
his
arrangements
had
already
been
made
and
this
time
the
murderer
would
not
get
away
from
him
i
expressed
some
doubt
on
this
reminding
him
of
his
disappearance
in
the
gallery
and
suggested
that
the
same
phenomenon
might
occur
again
he
answered
that
he
hoped
it
would
he
desired
nothing
more
i
did
not
insist
knowing
by
experience
how
useless
that
would
have
been
he
told
me
that
with
the
help
of
the
concierges
the
chateau
had
since
early
dawn
been
watched
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
could
approach
it
without
his
knowing
it
and
that
he
had
no
concern
for
those
who
might
have
left
it
and
remained
without
it
was
then
six
o
clock
by
his
watch
rising
he
made
a
sign
to
me
to
follow
him
and
without
in
the
least
trying
to
conceal
his
movements
or
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
he
led
me
through
the
gallery
we
reached
the
right
gallery
and
came
to
the
which
we
crossed
we
then
continued
our
way
in
the
gallery
of
the
left
wing
passing
professor
stangerson
s
apartment
at
the
far
end
of
the
gallery
before
coming
to
the
donjon
is
the
room
occupied
by
arthur
rance
we
knew
that
because
we
had
seen
him
at
the
window
looking
on
to
the
court
the
door
of
the
room
opens
on
to
the
end
of
the
gallery
exactly
facing
the
east
window
at
the
extremity
of
the
right
gallery
where
rouletabille
had
placed
daddy
jacques
and
commands
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
gallery
from
end
to
end
of
the
chateau
that
gallery
said
rouletabille
i
reserve
for
myself
when
i
tell
you
you
ll
come
and
take
your
place
and
he
made
me
enter
a
little
dark
triangular
closet
built
in
a
bend
of
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
door
of
arthur
rance
s
room
from
this
recess
i
could
see
all
that
occurred
in
the
gallery
as
well
as
if
i
had
been
standing
in
front
of
arthur
rance
s
door
and
i
could
watch
that
door
too
the
door
of
the
closet
which
was
to
be
my
place
of
observation
was
fitted
with
panels
of
transparent
glass
in
the
gallery
where
all
the
lamps
had
been
lit
it
was
quite
light
in
the
closet
however
it
was
quite
dark
it
was
a
splendid
place
from
which
to
observe
and
remain
unobserved
i
was
soon
to
play
the
part
of
a
spy
a
common
policeman
i
wonder
what
my
leader
at
the
bar
would
have
said
had
he
known
i
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
my
duties
but
i
could
not
refuse
rouletabille
the
assistance
he
had
begged
me
to
give
him
i
took
care
not
to
make
him
see
that
i
in
the
least
objected
and
for
several
reasons
i
wanted
to
oblige
him
i
did
not
wish
him
to
think
me
a
coward
i
was
filled
with
curiosity
and
it
was
too
late
for
me
to
draw
back
even
had
i
determined
to
do
so
that
i
had
not
had
these
scruples
sooner
was
because
my
curiosity
had
quite
got
the
better
of
me
i
might
also
urge
that
i
was
helping
to
save
the
life
of
a
woman
and
even
a
lawyer
may
do
that
conscientiously
we
returned
along
the
gallery
on
reaching
the
door
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
apartment
it
opened
from
a
push
given
by
the
steward
who
was
waiting
at
the
monsieur
stangerson
had
for
the
last
three
days
dined
with
his
daughter
in
the
on
the
first
floor
as
the
door
remained
open
we
distinctly
saw
mademoiselle
stangerson
taking
advantage
of
the
steward
s
absence
and
while
her
father
was
stooping
to
pick
up
something
he
had
let
fall
pour
the
contents
of
a
phial
into
monsieur
stangerson
s
glass
chapter
xxi
on
the
watch
the
act
which
staggered
me
did
not
appear
to
affect
rouletabille
much
we
returned
to
his
room
and
without
even
referring
to
what
we
had
seen
he
gave
me
his
final
instructions
for
the
night
first
we
were
to
go
to
dinner
after
dinner
i
was
to
take
my
stand
in
the
dark
closet
and
wait
there
as
long
as
it
was
necessary
to
look
out
for
what
might
happen
if
you
see
anything
before
i
do
he
explained
you
must
let
me
know
if
the
man
gets
into
the
right
gallery
by
any
other
way
than
the
gallery
you
will
see
him
before
i
shall
because
you
have
a
view
along
the
whole
length
of
the
right
gallery
while
i
can
only
command
a
view
of
the
gallery
all
you
need
do
to
let
me
know
is
to
undo
the
cord
holding
the
curtain
of
the
right
gallery
window
nearest
to
the
dark
closet
the
curtain
will
fall
of
itself
and
immediately
leave
a
square
of
shadow
where
previously
there
had
been
a
square
of
light
to
do
this
you
need
but
stretch
your
hand
out
of
the
closet
i
shall
understand
your
signal
and
then
then
you
will
see
me
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
what
am
i
to
do
then
you
will
immediately
come
towards
me
behind
the
man
but
i
shall
already
be
upon
him
and
shall
have
seen
his
i
attempted
a
feeble
smile
why
do
you
smile
well
you
may
smile
while
you
have
the
chance
but
i
swear
you
ll
have
no
time
for
that
a
few
hours
from
now
and
if
the
man
escapes
so
much
the
better
said
rouletabille
coolly
i
don
t
want
to
capture
him
he
may
take
himself
off
any
way
he
can
i
will
let
him
go
after
i
have
seen
his
face
that
s
all
i
want
i
shall
know
afterwards
what
to
do
so
that
as
far
as
mademoiselle
stangerson
is
concerned
he
shall
be
dead
to
her
even
though
he
continues
to
live
if
i
took
him
alive
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
robert
darzac
would
perhaps
never
forgive
me
and
i
wish
to
retain
their
and
respect
seeing
as
i
have
just
now
seen
mademoiselle
stangerson
pour
a
narcotic
into
her
father
s
glass
so
that
he
might
not
be
awake
to
interrupt
the
conversation
she
is
going
to
have
with
her
murderer
you
can
imagine
she
would
not
be
grateful
to
me
if
i
brought
the
man
of
the
yellow
room
and
the
inexplicable
gallery
bound
and
gagged
to
her
father
i
realise
now
that
if
i
am
to
save
the
unhappy
lady
i
must
silence
the
man
and
not
capture
him
to
kill
a
human
being
is
no
small
thing
besides
that
s
not
my
business
unless
the
man
himself
makes
it
my
business
on
the
other
hand
to
render
him
forever
silent
without
the
lady
s
assent
and
confidence
is
to
act
on
one
s
own
initiative
and
assumes
a
knowledge
of
everything
with
nothing
for
a
basis
fortunately
my
friend
i
have
guessed
no
i
have
reasoned
it
all
out
all
that
i
ask
of
the
man
who
is
coming
is
to
bring
me
his
face
so
that
it
may
enter
into
the
circle
exactly
and
his
face
won
t
surprise
me
but
i
thought
you
saw
his
face
on
the
night
when
you
sprang
into
the
chamber
only
imperfectly
the
candle
was
on
the
floor
and
his
beard
will
he
wear
his
beard
this
evening
i
think
i
can
say
for
certain
that
he
will
but
the
gallery
is
light
and
now
i
know
or
at
least
my
brain
knows
and
my
eyes
will
if
we
are
here
only
to
see
him
and
let
him
escape
why
are
we
armed
because
if
the
man
of
the
yellow
room
and
the
inexplicable
gallery
knows
that
i
know
he
is
capable
of
doing
anything
we
should
then
have
to
defend
and
you
are
sure
he
will
come
as
sure
as
that
you
are
standing
there
this
morning
at
ten
o
clock
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
the
cleverest
way
in
the
world
arranged
to
have
no
nurses
she
gave
them
leave
of
absence
for
hours
under
some
plausible
pretexts
and
did
not
desire
anybody
to
be
with
her
but
her
father
while
they
are
away
her
father
who
is
to
sleep
in
the
boudoir
has
gladly
consented
to
the
arrangement
darzac
s
departure
and
what
he
told
me
as
well
as
the
extraordinary
precautions
mademoiselle
stangerson
is
taking
to
be
alone
leaves
me
no
room
for
doubt
she
has
prepared
the
way
for
the
coming
of
the
man
whom
darzac
that
s
awful
it
is
and
what
we
saw
her
do
was
done
to
send
her
father
to
sleep
then
there
are
but
two
of
us
for
s
work
four
the
concierge
and
his
wife
will
watch
at
all
hazards
i
don
t
set
much
value
on
them
before
but
the
concierge
may
be
useful
after
if
there
s
to
be
any
killing
then
you
think
there
may
be
if
he
wishes
why
haven
t
you
brought
in
daddy
jacques
have
you
made
no
use
of
him
no
replied
rouletabille
sharply
i
kept
silence
for
awhile
then
anxious
to
know
his
thoughts
i
asked
him
point
blank
why
not
tell
arthur
rance
he
may
be
of
great
assistance
to
us
oh
said
rouletabille
crossly
then
you
want
to
let
everybody
into
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
secrets
come
let
us
go
to
dinner
it
is
time
this
evening
we
dine
in
frederic
larsan
s
room
at
least
if
he
is
not
on
the
heels
of
darzac
he
sticks
to
him
like
a
leech
but
anyhow
if
he
is
not
there
now
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
be
he
s
the
one
i
am
going
to
knock
over
at
this
moment
we
heard
a
noise
in
the
room
near
us
it
must
be
he
said
rouletabille
i
forgot
to
ask
you
i
said
if
we
are
to
make
any
allusion
to
s
business
when
we
are
with
this
policeman
i
take
it
we
are
not
is
that
so
evidently
we
are
going
to
operate
alone
on
our
own
personal
so
that
all
the
glory
will
be
ours
rouletabille
laughed
we
dined
with
frederic
larsan
in
his
room
he
told
us
he
had
just
come
in
and
invited
us
to
be
seated
at
table
we
ate
our
dinner
in
the
best
of
humours
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
appreciating
the
feelings
of
certainty
which
both
rouletabille
and
larsan
felt
rouletabille
told
the
great
fred
that
i
had
come
on
a
chance
visit
and
that
he
had
asked
me
to
stay
and
help
him
in
the
heavy
batch
of
writing
he
had
to
get
through
for
the
i
was
going
back
to
paris
he
said
by
the
eleven
o
clock
train
taking
his
copy
which
took
a
story
form
recounting
the
principal
episodes
in
the
mysteries
of
the
glandier
larsan
smiled
at
the
explanation
like
a
man
who
was
not
fooled
and
politely
refrains
from
making
the
slightest
remark
on
matters
which
did
not
concern
him
with
infinite
precautions
as
to
the
words
they
used
and
even
as
to
the
tones
of
their
voices
larsan
and
rouletabille
discussed
for
a
long
time
arthur
rance
s
appearance
at
the
chateau
and
his
past
in
america
about
which
they
expressed
a
desire
to
know
more
at
any
rate
so
far
as
his
relations
with
the
stangersons
at
one
time
larsan
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
unwell
said
with
an
effort
i
think
monsieur
rouletabille
that
we
ve
not
much
more
to
do
at
the
glandier
and
that
we
sha
n
t
sleep
here
many
more
i
think
so
too
monsieur
then
you
think
the
conclusion
of
the
matter
has
been
reached
i
think
indeed
that
we
have
nothing
more
to
find
out
replied
rouletabille
have
you
found
your
criminal
asked
larsan
have
you
so
have
i
said
rouletabille
can
it
be
the
same
man
i
don
t
know
if
you
have
swerved
from
your
original
idea
said
the
young
reporter
then
he
added
with
emphasis
monsieur
darzac
is
an
honest
man
are
you
sure
of
that
asked
larsan
well
i
am
sure
he
is
not
so
it
s
a
fight
then
yes
it
is
a
fight
but
i
shall
beat
you
monsieur
frederic
youth
never
doubts
anything
said
the
great
fred
laughingly
and
held
out
his
hand
to
me
by
way
of
conclusion
rouletabille
s
answer
came
like
an
echo
not
anything
suddenly
larsan
who
had
risen
to
wish
us
goodnight
pressed
both
his
hands
to
his
chest
and
staggered
he
was
obliged
to
lean
on
rouletabille
for
support
and
to
save
himself
from
falling
oh
oh
he
cried
what
is
the
matter
with
me
have
i
been
poisoned
he
looked
at
us
with
haggard
eyes
we
questioned
him
vainly
he
did
not
answer
us
he
had
sunk
into
an
armchair
and
we
could
get
not
a
word
from
him
we
were
extremely
distressed
both
on
his
account
and
on
our
own
for
we
had
partaken
of
all
the
dishes
he
had
eaten
he
seemed
to
be
out
of
pain
but
his
heavy
head
had
fallen
on
his
shoulder
and
his
eyelids
were
tightly
closed
rouletabille
bent
over
him
listening
for
the
beatings
of
the
heart
my
friend
s
face
however
when
he
stood
up
was
as
calm
as
it
had
been
a
moment
before
agitated
he
is
asleep
he
said
he
led
me
to
his
chamber
after
closing
larsan
s
room
the
drug
i
asked
does
mademoiselle
stangerson
wish
to
put
everybody
to
sleep
perhaps
replied
rouletabille
but
i
could
see
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
but
what
about
us
i
exclaimed
how
do
we
know
that
we
have
not
been
drugged
do
you
feel
indisposed
rouletabille
asked
me
coolly
not
in
the
do
you
feel
any
inclination
to
go
to
sleep
none
well
then
my
friend
smoke
this
excellent
and
he
handed
me
a
choice
havana
one
monsieur
darzac
had
given
him
while
he
lit
his
briarwood
his
eternal
briarwood
we
remained
in
his
room
until
about
ten
o
clock
without
a
word
passing
between
us
buried
in
an
armchair
rouletabille
sat
and
smoked
steadily
his
brow
in
thought
and
a
look
in
his
eyes
on
the
stroke
of
ten
he
took
off
his
boots
and
signalled
to
me
to
do
the
same
as
we
stood
in
our
socks
he
said
in
so
low
a
tone
that
i
guessed
rather
than
heard
the
word
i
drew
my
revolver
from
my
jacket
pocket
cock
it
he
said
i
did
as
he
directed
then
moving
towards
the
door
of
his
room
he
opened
it
with
infinite
precaution
it
made
no
sound
we
were
in
the
gallery
rouletabille
made
another
sign
to
me
which
i
understood
to
mean
that
i
was
to
take
up
my
post
in
the
dark
closet
when
i
was
some
distance
from
him
he
rejoined
me
and
embraced
me
and
then
i
saw
him
with
the
same
precaution
return
to
his
room
astonished
by
his
embrace
and
somewhat
disquieted
by
it
i
arrived
at
the
right
gallery
without
difficulty
crossing
the
and
reaching
the
dark
closet
before
entering
it
i
examined
the
of
the
window
and
found
that
i
had
only
to
release
it
from
its
fastening
with
my
fingers
for
the
curtain
to
fall
by
its
own
weight
and
hide
the
square
of
light
from
rouletabille
the
signal
agreed
upon
the
sound
of
a
footstep
made
me
halt
before
arthur
rance
s
door
he
was
not
yet
in
bed
then
how
was
it
that
being
in
the
chateau
he
had
not
dined
with
monsieur
stangerson
and
his
daughter
i
had
not
seen
him
at
table
with
them
at
the
moment
when
we
looked
in
i
retired
into
the
dark
closet
i
found
myself
perfectly
situated
i
could
see
along
the
whole
length
of
the
gallery
nothing
absolutely
nothing
could
pass
there
without
my
seeing
it
but
what
was
going
to
pass
there
rouletabille
s
embrace
came
back
to
my
mind
i
argued
that
people
don
t
part
from
each
other
in
that
way
unless
on
an
important
or
dangerous
occasion
was
i
then
in
danger
my
hand
closed
on
the
butt
of
my
revolver
and
i
waited
i
am
not
a
hero
but
neither
am
i
a
coward
i
waited
about
an
hour
and
during
all
that
time
i
saw
nothing
unusual
the
rain
which
had
begun
to
come
down
strongly
towards
nine
o
clock
had
now
ceased
my
friend
had
told
me
that
probably
nothing
would
occur
before
midnight
or
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
it
was
not
more
than
eleven
however
when
i
heard
the
door
of
arthur
rance
s
room
open
very
slowly
the
door
remained
open
for
a
minute
which
seemed
to
me
a
long
time
as
it
opened
into
the
gallery
that
is
to
say
outwards
i
could
not
see
what
was
passing
in
the
room
behind
the
door
at
that
moment
i
noticed
a
strange
sound
three
times
repeated
coming
from
the
park
ordinarily
i
should
not
have
attached
any
more
importance
to
it
than
i
would
to
the
noise
of
cats
on
the
roof
but
the
third
time
the
mew
was
so
sharp
and
penetrating
that
i
remembered
what
i
had
heard
about
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
as
the
cry
had
accompanied
all
the
events
at
the
glandier
i
could
not
refrain
from
shuddering
at
the
thought
directly
afterwards
i
saw
a
man
appear
on
the
outside
of
the
door
and
close
it
after
him
at
first
i
could
not
recognise
him
for
his
back
was
towards
me
and
he
was
bending
over
a
rather
bulky
package
when
he
had
closed
the
door
and
picked
up
the
package
he
turned
towards
the
dark
closet
and
then
i
saw
who
he
was
he
was
the
the
green
man
he
was
wearing
the
same
costume
that
he
had
worn
when
i
first
saw
him
on
the
road
in
front
of
the
donjon
inn
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
being
the
keeper
as
the
cry
of
the
bete
du
bon
dieu
came
for
the
third
time
he
put
down
the
package
and
went
to
the
second
window
counting
from
the
dark
closet
i
dared
not
risk
making
any
movement
fearing
i
might
betray
my
presence
arriving
at
the
window
he
peered
out
on
to
the
park
the
night
was
now
light
the
moon
showing
at
intervals
the
green
man
raised
his
arms
twice
making
signs
which
i
did
not
understand
then
leaving
the
window
he
again
took
up
his
package
and
moved
along
the
gallery
towards
the
rouletabille
had
instructed
me
to
undo
the
when
i
saw
anything
was
rouletabille
expecting
this
it
was
not
my
business
to
question
all
i
had
to
do
was
obey
instructions
i
unfastened
the
my
heart
beating
the
while
as
if
it
would
burst
the
man
reached
the
but
to
my
utter
surprise
i
had
expected
to
see
him
continue
to
pass
along
the
gallery
i
saw
him
descend
the
stairs
leading
to
the
vestibule
what
was
i
to
do
i
looked
stupidly
at
the
heavy
curtain
which
had
shut
the
light
from
the
window
the
signal
had
been
given
and
i
did
not
see
rouletabille
appear
at
the
corner
of
the
gallery
nobody
appeared
i
was
exceedingly
perplexed
half
an
hour
passed
an
age
to
me
what
was
i
to
do
now
even
if
i
saw
something
the
signal
once
given
i
could
not
give
it
a
second
time
to
venture
into
the
gallery
might
upset
all
rouletabille
s
plans
after
all
i
had
nothing
to
reproach
myself
for
and
if
something
had
happened
that
my
friend
had
not
expected
he
could
only
blame
himself
unable
to
be
of
any
further
assistance
to
him
by
means
of
a
signal
i
left
the
dark
closet
and
still
in
my
socks
made
my
way
to
the
gallery
there
was
no
one
there
i
went
to
the
door
of
rouletabille
s
room
and
listened
i
could
hear
nothing
i
knocked
gently
there
was
no
answer
i
turned
the
and
the
door
opened
i
entered
rouletabille
lay
extended
at
full
length
on
the
floor
chapter
xxii
the
incredible
body
i
bent
in
great
anxiety
over
the
body
of
the
reporter
and
had
the
joy
to
find
that
he
was
deeply
sleeping
the
same
unhealthy
sleep
that
i
had
seen
fall
upon
frederic
larsan
he
had
succumbed
to
the
influence
of
the
same
drug
that
had
been
mixed
with
our
food
how
was
it
then
that
i
also
had
not
been
overcome
by
it
i
reflected
that
the
drug
must
have
been
put
into
our
wine
because
that
would
explain
my
condition
i
never
drink
when
eating
naturally
inclined
to
obesity
i
am
restricted
to
a
dry
diet
i
shook
rouletabille
but
could
not
succeed
in
waking
him
this
no
doubt
was
the
work
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
she
had
certainly
thought
it
necessary
to
guard
herself
against
this
young
man
as
well
as
her
father
i
recalled
that
the
steward
in
serving
us
had
recommended
an
excellent
chablis
which
no
doubt
had
come
from
the
professor
s
table
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
i
resolved
under
the
pressing
circumstances
to
resort
to
extreme
measures
i
threw
a
pitcher
of
cold
water
over
rouletabille
s
head
he
opened
his
eyes
i
beat
his
face
and
raised
him
up
i
felt
him
stiffen
in
my
arms
and
heard
him
murmur
go
on
go
on
but
don
t
make
any
i
pinched
him
and
shook
him
until
he
was
able
to
stand
up
we
were
saved
they
sent
me
to
sleep
he
said
ah
i
passed
an
awful
quarter
of
an
hour
before
giving
way
but
it
is
over
now
don
t
leave
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
those
words
than
we
were
thrilled
by
a
frightful
cry
that
rang
through
the
chateau
a
veritable
death
cry
malheur
roared
rouletabille
we
shall
be
too
late
he
tried
to
rush
to
the
door
but
he
was
too
dazed
and
fell
against
the
wall
i
was
already
in
the
gallery
revolver
in
hand
rushing
like
a
madman
towards
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
the
moment
i
arrived
at
the
intersection
of
the
gallery
and
the
right
gallery
i
saw
a
figure
leaving
her
apartment
which
in
a
few
strides
had
reached
the
i
was
not
master
of
myself
i
fired
the
report
from
the
revolver
made
a
deafening
noise
but
the
man
continued
his
flight
down
the
stairs
i
ran
behind
him
shouting
stop
stop
or
i
will
kill
you
as
i
rushed
after
him
down
the
stairs
i
came
face
to
face
with
arthur
rance
coming
from
the
left
wing
of
the
chateau
yelling
what
is
it
what
is
it
we
arrived
almost
at
the
same
time
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
window
of
the
vestibule
was
open
we
distinctly
saw
the
form
of
a
man
running
away
instinctively
we
fired
our
revolvers
in
his
direction
he
was
not
more
than
ten
paces
in
front
of
us
he
staggered
and
we
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
we
had
sprung
out
of
the
window
but
the
man
dashed
off
with
renewed
vigour
i
was
in
my
socks
and
the
american
was
barefooted
there
being
no
hope
of
overtaking
him
we
fired
our
last
cartridges
at
him
but
he
still
kept
on
running
going
along
the
right
side
of
the
court
towards
the
end
of
the
right
wing
of
the
chateau
which
had
no
other
outlet
than
the
door
of
the
little
chamber
occupied
by
the
the
man
though
he
was
evidently
wounded
by
our
bullets
was
now
twenty
yards
ahead
of
us
suddenly
behind
us
and
above
our
heads
a
window
in
the
gallery
opened
and
we
heard
the
voice
of
rouletabille
crying
out
desperately
fire
bernier
fire
at
that
moment
the
clear
moonlight
night
was
further
lit
by
a
broad
flash
by
its
light
we
saw
daddy
bernier
with
his
gun
on
the
threshold
of
the
donjon
door
he
had
taken
good
aim
the
shadow
fell
but
as
it
had
reached
the
end
of
the
right
wing
of
the
chateau
it
fell
on
the
other
side
of
the
angle
of
the
building
that
is
to
say
we
saw
it
about
to
fall
but
not
the
actual
sinking
to
the
ground
bernier
arthur
rance
and
myself
reached
the
other
side
twenty
seconds
later
the
shadow
was
lying
dead
at
our
feet
aroused
from
his
lethargy
by
the
cries
and
reports
larsan
opened
the
window
of
his
chamber
and
called
out
to
us
rouletabille
quite
awake
now
joined
us
at
the
same
moment
and
i
cried
out
to
him
he
is
dead
is
dead
so
much
the
better
he
said
take
him
into
the
vestibule
of
the
then
as
if
on
second
thought
he
said
no
no
let
us
put
him
in
his
own
rouletabille
knocked
at
the
door
nobody
answered
naturally
this
did
not
surprise
me
he
is
evidently
not
there
otherwise
he
would
have
come
out
said
the
reporter
let
us
carry
him
to
the
vestibule
since
reaching
the
dead
shadow
a
thick
cloud
had
covered
the
moon
and
darkened
the
night
so
that
we
were
unable
to
make
out
the
features
daddy
jacques
who
had
now
joined
us
helped
us
to
carry
the
body
into
the
vestibule
where
we
laid
it
down
on
the
lower
step
of
the
stairs
on
the
way
i
had
felt
my
hands
wet
from
the
warm
blood
flowing
from
the
wounds
daddy
jacques
flew
to
the
kitchen
and
returned
with
a
lantern
he
held
it
close
to
the
face
of
the
dead
shadow
and
we
recognised
the
keeper
the
man
called
by
the
landlord
of
the
donjon
inn
the
green
man
whom
an
hour
earlier
i
had
seen
come
out
of
arthur
rance
s
chamber
carrying
a
parcel
but
what
i
had
seen
i
could
only
tell
rouletabille
later
when
we
were
alone
rouletabille
and
frederic
larsan
experienced
a
cruel
disappointment
at
the
result
of
the
night
s
adventure
they
could
only
look
in
consternation
and
stupefaction
at
the
body
of
the
green
man
daddy
jacques
showed
a
stupidly
sorrowful
face
and
with
silly
lamentations
kept
repeating
that
we
were
mistaken
the
keeper
could
not
be
the
assailant
we
were
obliged
to
compel
him
to
be
quiet
he
could
not
have
shown
greater
grief
had
the
body
been
that
of
his
own
son
i
noticed
while
all
the
rest
of
us
were
more
or
less
undressed
and
barefooted
that
he
was
fully
clothed
rouletabille
had
not
left
the
body
kneeling
on
the
flagstones
by
the
light
of
daddy
jacques
s
lantern
he
removed
the
clothes
from
the
body
and
laid
bare
its
breast
then
snatching
the
lantern
from
daddy
jacques
he
held
it
over
the
corpse
and
saw
a
gaping
wound
rising
suddenly
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
filled
with
savage
irony
the
man
you
believe
to
have
been
shot
was
killed
by
the
stab
of
a
knife
in
his
heart
i
thought
rouletabille
had
gone
mad
but
bending
over
the
body
i
quickly
satisfied
myself
that
rouletabille
was
right
not
a
sign
of
a
bullet
anywhere
the
wound
evidently
made
by
a
sharp
blade
had
penetrated
the
heart
chapter
xxiii
the
double
scent
i
had
hardly
recovered
from
the
surprise
into
which
this
new
discovery
had
plunged
me
when
rouletabille
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
asked
me
to
follow
him
into
his
room
what
are
we
going
to
do
there
to
think
the
matter
i
confess
i
was
in
no
condition
for
doing
much
thinking
nor
could
i
understand
how
rouletabille
could
so
control
himself
as
to
be
able
calmly
to
sit
down
for
reflection
when
he
must
have
known
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
at
that
moment
almost
on
the
point
of
death
but
his
was
more
than
i
could
explain
closing
the
door
of
his
room
he
motioned
me
to
a
chair
and
seating
himself
before
me
took
out
his
pipe
we
sat
there
for
some
time
in
silence
and
then
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
daylight
it
was
eight
o
clock
by
my
watch
rouletabille
was
no
longer
in
the
room
i
rose
to
go
out
when
the
door
opened
and
my
friend
he
had
evidently
lost
no
time
how
about
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
asked
him
her
condition
though
very
alarming
is
not
when
did
you
leave
this
room
towards
i
guess
you
have
been
hard
at
work
rather
have
you
found
out
anything
two
sets
of
footprints
do
they
explain
anything
have
they
anything
to
do
with
the
mystery
of
the
keeper
s
body
yes
the
mystery
is
no
longer
a
mystery
this
morning
walking
round
the
chateau
i
found
two
distinct
sets
of
footprints
made
at
the
same
time
last
night
they
were
made
by
two
persons
walking
side
by
side
i
followed
them
from
the
court
towards
the
oak
grove
larsan
joined
me
they
were
the
same
kind
of
footprints
as
were
made
at
the
time
of
the
assault
in
the
yellow
room
one
set
was
from
clumsy
boots
and
the
other
was
made
by
neat
ones
except
that
the
big
toe
of
one
of
the
sets
was
of
a
different
size
from
the
one
measured
in
the
yellow
room
incident
i
compared
the
marks
with
the
paper
patterns
i
had
previously
made
still
following
the
tracks
of
the
prints
larsan
and
i
passed
out
of
the
oak
grove
and
reached
the
border
of
the
lake
there
they
turned
off
to
a
little
path
leading
to
the
high
road
to
epinay
where
we
lost
the
traces
in
the
newly
macadamised
highway
we
went
back
to
the
chateau
and
parted
at
the
courtyard
we
met
again
however
in
daddy
jacques
s
room
to
which
our
separate
trains
of
thinking
had
led
us
both
we
found
the
old
servant
in
bed
his
clothes
on
the
chair
were
wet
through
and
his
boots
very
muddy
he
certainly
did
not
get
into
that
state
in
helping
us
to
carry
the
body
of
the
keeper
it
was
not
raining
then
then
his
face
showed
extreme
fatigue
and
he
looked
at
us
out
of
eyes
on
our
first
questioning
him
he
told
us
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
immediately
after
the
doctor
had
arrived
on
pressing
him
however
for
it
was
evident
to
us
he
was
not
speaking
the
truth
he
confessed
that
he
had
been
away
from
the
chateau
he
explained
his
absence
by
saying
that
he
had
a
headache
and
went
out
into
the
fresh
air
but
had
gone
no
further
than
the
oak
grove
when
we
then
described
to
him
the
whole
route
he
had
followed
he
sat
up
in
bed
trembling
and
you
were
not
alone
cried
larsan
did
you
see
it
then
gasped
daddy
jacques
what
i
asked
the
phantom
the
black
phantom
then
he
told
us
that
for
several
nights
he
had
seen
what
he
kept
calling
the
black
phantom
it
came
into
the
park
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
and
glided
stealthily
through
the
trees
it
appeared
to
him
to
pass
through
the
trunks
of
the
trees
twice
he
had
seen
it
from
his
window
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
had
risen
and
followed
the
strange
apparition
the
night
before
last
he
had
almost
overtaken
it
but
it
had
vanished
at
the
corner
of
the
donjon
last
night
however
he
had
not
left
the
chateau
his
mind
being
disturbed
by
a
presentiment
that
some
new
crime
would
be
attempted
suddenly
he
saw
the
black
phantom
rush
out
from
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
court
he
followed
it
to
the
lake
and
to
the
high
road
to
epinay
where
the
phantom
suddenly
disappeared
did
you
see
his
face
demanded
larsan
no
i
saw
nothing
but
black
did
you
go
out
after
what
passed
on
the
gallery
i
could
not
i
was
daddy
jacques
i
said
in
a
threatening
voice
you
did
not
follow
it
you
and
the
phantom
walked
to
epinay
together
arm
in
arm
no
he
cried
turning
his
eyes
away
i
did
not
it
came
on
to
pour
and
i
turned
back
i
don
t
know
what
became
of
the
black
we
left
him
and
when
we
were
outside
i
turned
to
larsan
looking
him
full
in
the
face
and
put
my
question
suddenly
to
take
him
off
his
guard
an
accomplice
how
can
i
tell
he
replied
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
can
t
be
sure
of
anything
in
a
case
like
this
hours
ago
i
would
have
sworn
that
there
was
no
accomplice
he
left
me
saying
he
was
off
to
well
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
asked
rouletabille
after
he
had
ended
his
recital
personally
i
am
utterly
in
the
dark
i
can
t
make
anything
out
of
it
what
do
you
gather
everything
everything
he
exclaimed
but
he
said
abruptly
let
s
find
out
more
about
mademoiselle
chapter
xxiv
rouletabille
knows
the
two
halves
of
the
murderer
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
been
almost
murdered
for
the
second
time
unfortunately
she
was
in
too
weak
a
state
to
bear
the
severer
injuries
of
this
second
attack
as
well
as
she
had
those
of
the
first
she
had
received
three
wounds
in
the
breast
from
the
murderer
s
knife
and
she
lay
long
between
life
and
death
her
strong
physique
however
saved
her
but
though
she
recovered
physically
it
was
found
that
her
mind
had
been
affected
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
terrible
incident
sent
her
into
delirium
and
the
arrest
of
robert
darzac
which
followed
on
the
day
following
the
tragic
death
of
the
keeper
seemed
to
sink
her
fine
intelligence
into
complete
melancholia
robert
darzac
arrived
at
the
chateau
towards
nine
i
saw
him
hurrying
through
the
park
his
hair
and
clothes
in
disorder
and
his
face
a
deadly
white
rouletabille
and
i
were
looking
out
of
a
window
in
the
gallery
he
saw
us
and
gave
a
despairing
cry
i
m
too
late
rouletabille
answered
she
lives
a
minute
later
darzac
had
gone
into
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
and
through
the
door
we
could
hear
his
sobs
there
s
a
fate
about
this
place
groaned
rouletabille
some
infernal
gods
must
be
watching
over
the
misfortunes
of
this
family
if
i
had
not
been
drugged
i
should
have
saved
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
should
have
silenced
him
forever
and
the
keeper
would
not
have
been
killed
monsieur
darzac
came
in
to
speak
with
us
his
distress
was
terrible
rouletabille
told
him
everything
his
preparations
for
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
safety
his
plans
for
either
capturing
or
for
disposing
of
the
assailant
for
ever
and
how
he
would
have
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
the
drugging
if
only
you
had
trusted
me
said
the
young
man
in
a
low
tone
if
you
had
but
begged
mademoiselle
stangerson
to
confide
in
me
but
then
everybody
here
distrusts
everybody
else
the
daughter
distrusts
her
father
and
even
her
lover
while
you
ask
me
to
protect
her
she
is
doing
all
she
can
to
frustrate
me
that
was
why
i
came
on
the
scene
too
late
at
monsieur
robert
darzac
s
request
rouletabille
described
the
whole
scene
leaning
on
the
wall
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
he
had
made
his
way
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
while
we
were
running
after
the
supposed
murderer
the
door
was
open
and
when
he
entered
he
found
mademoiselle
stangerson
lying
partly
thrown
over
the
desk
her
was
dyed
with
the
blood
flowing
from
her
bosom
still
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
he
felt
he
was
walking
in
a
horrible
nightmare
he
went
back
to
the
gallery
automatically
opened
a
window
shouted
his
order
to
fire
and
then
returned
to
the
room
he
crossed
the
deserted
boudoir
entered
the
and
tried
to
rouse
monsieur
stangerson
who
was
lying
on
a
sofa
monsieur
stangerson
rose
stupidly
and
let
himself
be
drawn
by
rouletabille
into
the
room
where
on
seeing
his
daughter
s
body
he
uttered
a
cry
both
united
their
feeble
strength
and
carried
her
to
her
bed
on
his
way
to
join
us
rouletabille
passed
by
the
desk
on
the
floor
near
it
he
saw
a
large
packet
he
knelt
down
and
finding
the
wrapper
loose
he
examined
it
and
made
out
an
enormous
quantity
of
papers
and
photographs
on
one
of
the
papers
he
read
new
differential
electroscopic
condenser
fundamental
properties
of
substance
intermediary
between
ponderable
matter
and
imponderable
strange
irony
of
fate
that
the
professor
s
precious
papers
should
be
restored
to
him
at
the
very
time
when
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
deprive
him
of
his
daughter
s
life
what
are
papers
worth
to
him
now
the
morning
following
that
awful
night
saw
monsieur
de
marquet
once
more
at
the
chateau
with
his
registrar
and
gendarmes
of
course
we
were
all
questioned
rouletabille
and
i
had
already
agreed
on
what
to
say
i
kept
back
any
information
as
to
my
being
in
the
dark
closet
and
said
nothing
about
the
drugging
we
did
not
wish
to
suggest
in
any
way
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
been
expecting
her
nocturnal
visitor
the
poor
woman
might
perhaps
never
recover
and
it
was
none
of
our
business
to
lift
the
veil
of
a
secret
the
preservation
of
which
she
had
paid
for
so
dearly
arthur
rance
told
everybody
in
a
manner
so
natural
that
it
astonished
me
that
he
had
last
seen
the
keeper
towards
eleven
o
clock
of
that
fatal
night
he
had
come
for
his
valise
he
said
which
he
was
to
take
for
him
early
next
morning
to
the
station
and
had
been
kept
out
late
running
after
poachers
arthur
rance
had
indeed
intended
to
leave
the
chateau
and
according
to
his
habit
to
walk
to
the
station
monsieur
stangerson
confirmed
what
rance
had
said
adding
that
he
had
not
asked
rance
to
dine
with
him
because
his
friend
had
taken
his
final
leave
of
them
both
earlier
in
the
evening
monsieur
rance
had
had
tea
served
him
in
his
room
because
he
had
complained
of
a
slight
indisposition
bernier
testified
instructed
by
rouletabille
that
the
keeper
had
ordered
him
to
meet
at
a
spot
near
the
oak
grove
for
the
purpose
of
looking
out
for
poachers
finding
that
the
keeper
did
not
keep
his
appointment
he
bernier
had
gone
in
search
of
him
he
had
almost
arrived
at
the
donjon
when
he
saw
a
figure
running
swiftly
in
a
direction
opposite
to
him
towards
the
right
wing
of
the
chateau
he
heard
revolver
shots
from
behind
the
figure
and
saw
rouletabille
at
one
of
the
gallery
windows
he
heard
rouletabille
call
out
to
him
to
fire
and
he
had
fired
he
believed
he
had
killed
the
man
until
he
learned
after
rouletabille
had
uncovered
the
body
that
the
man
had
died
from
a
knife
thrust
who
had
given
it
he
could
not
imagine
nobody
could
have
been
near
the
spot
without
my
seeing
when
the
examining
magistrate
reminded
him
that
the
spot
where
the
body
was
found
was
very
dark
and
that
he
himself
had
not
been
able
to
recognise
the
keeper
before
firing
daddy
bernier
replied
that
neither
had
they
seen
the
other
body
nor
had
they
found
it
in
the
narrow
court
where
five
people
were
standing
it
would
have
been
strange
if
the
other
body
had
it
been
there
could
have
escaped
the
only
door
that
opened
into
the
court
was
that
of
the
keeper
s
room
and
that
door
was
closed
and
the
key
of
it
was
found
in
the
keeper
s
pocket
however
that
might
be
the
examining
magistrate
did
not
pursue
his
inquiry
further
in
this
direction
he
was
evidently
convinced
that
we
had
missed
the
man
we
were
chasing
and
we
had
come
upon
the
keeper
s
body
in
our
chase
this
matter
of
the
keeper
was
another
matter
entirely
he
wanted
to
satisfy
himself
about
that
without
any
further
delay
probably
it
fitted
in
with
the
conclusions
he
had
already
arrived
at
as
to
the
keeper
and
his
intrigues
with
the
wife
of
mathieu
the
landlord
of
the
donjon
inn
this
mathieu
later
in
the
afternoon
was
arrested
and
taken
to
corbeil
in
spite
of
his
rheumatism
he
had
been
heard
to
threaten
the
keeper
and
though
no
evidence
against
him
had
been
found
at
his
inn
the
evidence
of
carters
who
had
heard
the
threats
was
enough
to
justify
his
retention
the
examination
had
proceeded
thus
far
when
to
our
surprise
frederic
larsan
returned
to
the
chateau
he
was
accompanied
by
one
of
the
employeeees
of
the
railway
at
that
moment
rance
and
i
were
in
the
vestibule
discussing
mathieu
s
guilt
or
innocence
while
rouletabille
stood
apart
buried
apparently
in
thought
the
examining
magistrate
and
his
registrar
were
in
the
little
green
while
darzac
was
with
the
doctor
and
stangerson
in
the
lady
s
chamber
as
frederic
larsan
entered
the
vestibule
with
the
railway
employeee
rouletabille
and
i
at
once
recognised
him
by
the
small
blond
beard
we
exchanged
meaningful
glances
larsan
had
himself
announced
to
the
examining
magistrate
by
the
gendarme
and
entered
with
the
railway
servant
as
daddy
jacques
came
out
some
ten
minutes
went
by
during
which
rouletabille
appeared
extremely
impatient
the
door
of
the
was
then
opened
and
we
heard
the
magistrate
calling
to
the
gendarme
who
entered
presently
he
came
out
mounted
the
stairs
and
coming
back
shortly
went
in
to
the
magistrate
and
said
monsieur
monsieur
robert
darzac
will
not
come
what
not
come
cried
monsieur
de
marquet
he
says
he
can
not
leave
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
her
present
very
well
said
monsieur
de
marquet
then
we
ll
go
to
monsieur
de
marquet
and
the
gendarme
mounted
the
stairs
he
made
a
sign
to
larsan
and
the
railroad
employeee
to
follow
rouletabille
and
i
went
along
too
on
reaching
the
door
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
monsieur
de
marquet
knocked
a
chambermaid
appeared
it
was
sylvia
with
her
hair
all
in
disorder
and
consternation
showing
on
her
face
is
monsieur
stangerson
within
asked
the
magistrate
yes
tell
him
that
i
wish
to
speak
with
stangerson
came
out
his
appearance
was
wretched
in
the
extreme
what
do
you
want
he
demanded
of
the
magistrate
may
i
not
be
left
in
peace
monsieur
monsieur
said
the
magistrate
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
monsieur
darzac
at
once
if
you
can
not
induce
him
to
come
i
shall
be
compelled
to
use
the
help
of
the
the
professor
made
no
reply
he
looked
at
us
all
like
a
man
being
led
to
execution
and
then
went
back
into
the
room
almost
immediately
after
monsieur
robert
darzac
came
out
he
was
very
pale
he
looked
at
us
and
his
eyes
falling
on
the
railway
servant
his
features
stiffened
and
he
could
hardly
repress
a
groan
we
were
all
much
moved
by
the
appearance
of
the
man
we
felt
that
what
was
about
to
happen
would
decide
the
fate
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
frederic
larsan
s
face
alone
was
radiant
showing
a
joy
as
of
a
dog
that
had
at
last
got
its
prey
pointing
to
the
railway
servant
monsieur
de
marquet
said
to
monsieur
darzac
do
you
recognise
this
man
monsieur
i
do
said
monsieur
darzac
in
a
tone
which
he
vainly
tried
to
make
firm
he
is
an
employeee
at
the
station
at
this
young
man
went
on
monsieur
de
marquet
affirms
that
he
saw
you
get
off
the
train
at
that
night
said
monsieur
darzac
interrupting
at
ten
it
is
quite
an
interval
of
silence
followed
monsieur
darzac
the
magistrate
went
on
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
monsieur
darzac
what
were
you
doing
that
night
at
at
that
time
monsieur
darzac
remained
silent
simply
closing
his
eyes
monsieur
darzac
insisted
monsieur
de
marquet
can
you
tell
me
how
you
employeeed
your
time
that
night
monsieur
darzac
opened
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
no
think
monsieur
for
if
you
persist
in
your
strange
refusal
i
shall
be
under
the
painful
necessity
of
keeping
you
at
my
i
monsieur
darzac
in
the
name
of
the
law
i
arrest
you
the
magistrate
had
no
sooner
pronounced
the
words
than
i
saw
rouletabille
move
quickly
towards
monsieur
darzac
he
would
certainly
have
spoken
to
him
but
darzac
by
a
gesture
held
him
off
as
the
gendarme
approached
his
prisoner
a
despairing
cry
rang
through
the
room
robert
robert
we
recognised
the
voice
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
we
all
shuddered
larsan
himself
turned
pale
monsieur
darzac
in
response
to
the
cry
had
flown
back
into
the
room
the
magistrate
the
gendarme
and
larsan
followed
closely
after
rouletabille
and
i
remained
on
the
threshold
it
was
a
sight
that
met
our
eyes
mademoiselle
stangerson
with
a
face
of
deathly
pallor
had
risen
on
her
bed
in
spite
of
the
restraining
efforts
of
two
doctors
and
her
father
she
was
holding
out
her
trembling
arms
towards
robert
darzac
on
whom
larsan
and
the
gendarme
had
laid
hands
her
distended
eyes
saw
she
understood
her
lips
seemed
to
form
a
word
but
nobody
made
it
out
and
she
fell
back
insensible
monsieur
darzac
was
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
placed
in
the
vestibule
to
wait
for
the
vehicle
larsan
had
gone
to
fetch
we
were
all
overcome
by
emotion
and
even
monsieur
de
marquet
had
tears
in
his
eyes
rouletabille
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
say
to
monsieur
darzac
are
you
going
to
put
in
any
defense
no
replied
the
prisoner
very
well
then
i
will
you
can
not
do
it
said
the
unhappy
man
with
a
faint
smile
i
can
and
i
rouletabille
s
voice
had
in
it
a
strange
strength
and
confidence
i
can
do
it
monsieur
robert
darzac
because
i
know
more
than
you
do
come
come
murmured
darzac
almost
angrily
have
no
fear
i
shall
know
only
what
will
benefit
you
must
know
nothing
young
man
if
you
want
me
to
be
rouletabille
shook
his
head
going
close
up
to
darzac
listen
to
what
i
am
about
to
say
he
said
in
a
low
tone
and
let
it
give
you
confidence
you
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
murderer
mademoiselle
stangerson
knows
it
but
only
half
of
it
but
i
know
his
two
halves
i
know
the
whole
man
robert
darzac
opened
his
eyes
with
a
look
that
showed
he
had
not
understood
a
word
of
what
rouletabille
had
said
to
him
at
that
moment
the
conveyance
arrived
driven
by
frederic
larsan
darzac
and
the
gendarme
entered
it
larsan
remaining
on
the
driver
s
seat
the
prisoner
was
taken
to
corbeil
chapter
xxv
rouletabille
goes
on
a
journey
that
same
evening
rouletabille
and
i
left
the
glandier
we
were
very
glad
to
get
away
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
keep
us
there
i
declared
my
intention
to
give
up
the
whole
matter
it
had
been
too
much
for
me
rouletabille
with
a
friendly
tap
on
my
shoulder
confessed
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
learn
at
the
glandier
he
had
learned
there
all
it
had
to
tell
him
we
reached
paris
about
eight
o
clock
dined
and
then
tired
out
we
separated
agreeing
to
meet
the
next
morning
at
my
rooms
rouletabille
arrived
next
day
at
the
hour
agreed
on
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
english
tweed
with
an
ulster
on
his
arm
and
a
valise
in
his
hand
evidently
he
had
prepared
himself
for
a
journey
how
long
shall
you
be
away
i
asked
a
month
or
two
he
said
it
all
i
asked
him
no
more
questions
do
you
know
he
asked
what
the
word
was
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
tried
to
say
before
she
fainted
no
nobody
heard
i
heard
it
replied
rouletabille
she
said
speak
do
you
think
darzac
will
speak
i
was
about
to
make
some
further
observations
but
he
wrung
my
hand
warmly
and
wished
me
i
had
only
time
to
ask
him
one
question
before
he
left
are
you
not
afraid
that
other
attempts
may
be
made
while
you
re
away
no
not
now
that
darzac
is
in
prison
he
answered
with
this
strange
remark
he
left
i
was
not
to
see
him
again
until
the
day
of
darzac
s
trial
at
the
court
when
he
appeared
to
explain
the
inexplicable
chapter
xxvi
in
which
joseph
rouletabille
is
awaited
with
impatience
on
the
of
january
that
is
to
say
two
months
and
a
half
after
the
tragic
events
i
have
narrated
the
epoque
printed
as
the
first
column
of
the
front
page
the
following
sensational
article
the
jury
is
summoned
to
give
its
verdict
on
one
of
the
most
mysterious
affairs
in
the
annals
of
crime
there
never
has
been
a
case
with
so
many
obscure
incomprehensible
and
inexplicable
points
and
yet
the
prosecution
has
not
hesitated
to
put
into
the
prisoner
s
dock
a
man
who
is
respected
esteemed
and
loved
by
all
who
knew
him
a
young
savant
the
hope
of
french
science
whose
whole
life
has
been
devoted
to
knowledge
and
truth
when
paris
heard
of
monsieur
robert
darzac
s
arrest
a
unanimous
cry
of
protest
arose
from
all
sides
the
whole
sorbonne
disgraced
by
this
act
of
the
examining
magistrate
asserted
its
belief
in
the
innocence
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
fiance
monsieur
stangerson
was
loud
in
his
denunciation
of
this
miscarriage
of
justice
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
anybody
that
could
the
victim
speak
she
would
claim
from
the
jurors
of
the
man
she
wishes
to
make
her
husband
and
whom
the
prosecution
would
send
to
the
scaffold
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
will
shortly
recover
her
reason
which
has
been
temporarily
unhinged
by
the
horrible
mystery
at
the
glandier
the
question
before
the
jury
is
the
one
we
propose
to
deal
with
this
very
day
we
have
decided
not
to
permit
twelve
worthy
men
to
commit
a
disgraceful
miscarriage
of
justice
we
confess
that
the
remarkable
coincidences
the
many
convicting
evidences
and
the
inexplicable
silence
on
the
part
of
the
accused
as
well
as
a
total
absence
of
any
evidence
for
an
alibi
were
enough
to
warrant
the
bench
of
judges
in
assuming
that
in
this
man
alone
was
centered
the
truth
of
the
affair
the
evidences
are
in
appearance
so
overwhelming
against
monsieur
robert
darzac
that
a
detective
so
well
informed
so
intelligent
and
generally
so
successful
as
monsieur
frederic
larsan
may
be
excused
for
having
been
misled
by
them
up
to
now
everything
has
gone
against
monsieur
robert
darzac
in
the
magisterial
inquiry
however
we
are
going
to
defend
him
before
the
jury
and
we
are
going
to
bring
to
the
witness
stand
a
light
that
will
illumine
the
whole
mystery
of
the
glandier
for
we
possess
the
truth
if
we
have
not
spoken
sooner
it
is
because
the
interests
of
certain
parties
in
the
case
demand
that
we
should
take
that
course
our
readers
may
remember
the
unsigned
reports
we
published
relating
to
the
left
foot
of
the
rue
oberkampf
at
the
time
of
the
famous
robbery
of
the
credit
universel
and
the
famous
case
of
the
gold
ingots
of
the
in
both
those
cases
we
were
able
to
discover
the
truth
long
before
even
the
excellent
ingenuity
of
frederic
larsan
had
been
able
to
unravel
it
these
reports
were
written
by
our
youngest
reporter
joseph
rouletabille
a
youth
of
eighteen
whose
fame
will
be
when
attention
was
first
drawn
to
the
glandier
case
our
youthful
reporter
was
on
the
spot
and
installed
in
the
chateau
when
every
other
representative
of
the
press
had
been
denied
admission
he
worked
side
by
side
with
frederic
larsan
he
was
amazed
and
terrified
at
the
grave
mistake
the
celebrated
detective
was
about
to
make
and
tried
to
divert
him
from
the
false
scent
he
was
following
but
the
great
fred
refused
to
receive
instructions
from
this
young
journalist
we
know
now
where
it
brought
monsieur
robert
darzac
but
now
france
must
know
the
whole
world
must
know
that
on
the
very
evening
on
which
monsieur
darzac
was
arrested
young
rouletabille
entered
our
editorial
office
and
informed
us
that
he
was
about
to
go
away
on
a
journey
how
long
i
shall
be
away
he
said
i
can
not
say
perhaps
a
month
perhaps
two
perhaps
three
perhaps
i
may
never
return
here
is
a
letter
if
i
am
not
back
on
the
day
on
which
monsieur
darzac
is
to
appear
before
the
assize
court
have
this
letter
opened
and
read
to
the
court
after
all
the
witnesses
have
been
heard
arrange
it
with
monsieur
darzac
s
counsel
monsieur
darzac
is
innocent
in
this
letter
is
written
the
name
of
the
murderer
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
i
am
leaving
to
get
my
proofs
for
the
irrefutable
evidence
of
the
murderer
s
our
reporter
departed
for
a
long
time
we
were
without
news
from
him
but
a
week
ago
a
stranger
called
upon
our
manager
and
said
act
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
of
joseph
rouletabille
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
do
so
the
letter
left
by
him
holds
the
the
gentleman
who
brought
us
this
message
would
not
give
us
his
name
the
of
january
is
the
day
of
the
trial
joseph
rouletabille
has
not
returned
it
may
be
we
shall
never
see
him
again
the
press
also
counts
its
heroes
its
martyrs
to
duty
it
may
be
he
is
no
longer
living
we
shall
know
how
to
avenge
him
our
manager
will
this
afternoon
be
at
the
court
of
assize
at
versailles
with
the
letter
the
letter
containing
the
name
of
the
murderer
those
parisians
who
flocked
to
the
assize
court
at
versailles
to
be
present
at
the
trial
of
what
was
known
as
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
will
certainly
remember
the
terrible
crush
at
the
station
the
ordinary
trains
were
so
full
that
special
trains
had
to
be
made
up
the
article
in
the
epoque
had
so
excited
the
populace
that
discussion
was
rife
everywhere
even
to
the
verge
of
blows
partisans
of
rouletabille
fought
with
the
supporters
of
frederic
larsan
curiously
enough
the
excitement
was
due
less
to
the
fact
that
an
innocent
man
was
in
danger
of
a
wrongful
conviction
than
to
the
interest
taken
in
their
own
ideas
as
to
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
each
had
his
explanation
to
which
each
held
fast
those
who
explained
the
crime
on
frederic
larsan
s
theory
would
not
admit
that
there
could
be
any
doubt
as
to
the
perspicacity
of
the
popular
detective
others
who
had
arrived
at
a
different
solution
naturally
insisted
that
this
was
rouletabille
s
explanation
though
they
did
not
as
yet
know
what
that
was
with
the
day
s
epoque
in
their
hands
the
larsans
and
the
rouletabilles
fought
and
shoved
each
other
on
the
steps
of
the
palais
de
justice
right
into
the
court
itself
those
who
could
not
get
in
remained
in
the
neighbourhood
until
evening
and
were
with
great
difficulty
kept
back
by
the
soldiery
and
the
police
they
became
hungry
for
news
welcoming
the
most
absurd
rumours
at
one
time
the
rumour
spread
that
monsieur
stangerson
himself
had
been
arrested
in
the
court
and
had
confessed
to
being
the
murderer
this
goes
to
show
to
what
a
pitch
of
madness
nervous
excitement
may
carry
people
rouletabille
was
still
expected
some
pretended
to
know
him
and
when
a
young
man
with
a
pass
crossed
the
open
space
which
separated
the
crowd
from
the
court
house
a
scuffle
took
place
cries
were
raised
of
rouletabille
there
s
rouletabille
the
arrival
of
the
manager
of
the
paper
was
the
signal
for
a
great
demonstration
some
applauded
others
hissed
the
trial
itself
was
presided
over
by
monsieur
de
rocouz
a
judge
filled
with
the
prejudice
of
his
class
but
a
man
honest
at
heart
the
witnesses
had
been
called
i
was
there
of
course
as
were
all
who
had
in
any
way
been
in
touch
with
the
mysteries
of
the
glandier
monsieur
stangerson
looking
many
years
older
and
almost
unrecognisable
larsan
arthur
rance
with
his
face
ruddy
as
ever
daddy
jacques
daddy
mathieu
who
was
brought
into
court
handcuffed
between
two
gendarmes
madame
mathieu
in
tears
the
two
berniers
the
two
nurses
the
steward
all
the
domestics
of
the
chateau
the
employeee
of
the
paris
post
office
the
railway
employeee
from
epinay
some
friends
of
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
all
monsieur
darzac
s
witnesses
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
called
early
in
the
trial
so
that
i
was
then
able
to
watch
and
be
present
at
almost
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
the
court
was
so
crowded
that
many
lawyers
were
compelled
to
find
seats
on
the
steps
behind
the
bench
of
justices
were
representatives
from
other
benches
monsieur
robert
darzac
stood
in
the
prisoner
s
dock
between
policemen
tall
handsome
and
calm
a
murmur
of
admiration
rather
than
of
compassion
greeted
his
appearance
he
leaned
forward
towards
his
counsel
maitre
henri
robert
who
assisted
by
his
chief
secretary
maitre
andre
hesse
was
busily
turning
over
the
folios
of
his
brief
many
expected
that
monsieur
stangerson
after
giving
his
evidence
would
have
gone
over
to
the
prisoner
and
shaken
hands
with
him
but
he
left
the
court
without
another
word
it
was
remarked
that
the
jurors
appeared
to
be
deeply
interested
in
a
rapid
conversation
which
the
manager
of
the
epoque
was
having
with
maitre
henri
robert
the
manager
later
sat
down
in
the
front
row
of
the
public
seats
some
were
surprised
that
he
was
not
asked
to
remain
with
the
other
witnesses
in
the
room
reserved
for
them
the
reading
of
the
indictment
was
got
through
as
it
always
is
without
any
incident
i
shall
not
here
report
the
long
examination
to
which
monsieur
darzac
was
subjected
he
answered
all
the
questions
quickly
and
easily
his
silence
as
to
the
important
matters
of
which
we
know
was
dead
against
him
it
would
seem
as
if
this
reticence
would
be
fatal
for
him
he
resented
the
president
s
reprimands
he
was
told
that
his
silence
might
mean
death
very
well
he
said
i
will
submit
to
it
but
i
am
with
that
splendid
ability
which
has
made
his
fame
maitre
robert
took
advantage
of
the
incident
and
tried
to
show
that
it
brought
out
in
noble
relief
his
client
s
character
for
only
heroic
natures
could
remain
silent
for
moral
reasons
in
face
of
such
a
danger
the
eminent
advocate
however
only
succeeded
in
assuring
those
who
were
already
assured
of
darzac
s
innocence
at
the
adjournment
rouletabille
had
not
yet
arrived
every
time
a
door
opened
all
eyes
there
turned
towards
it
and
back
to
the
manager
of
the
epoque
who
sat
impassive
in
his
place
when
he
once
was
feeling
in
his
pocket
a
loud
murmur
of
expectation
followed
the
letter
it
is
not
however
my
intention
to
report
in
detail
the
course
of
the
trial
my
readers
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
mysteries
surrounding
the
glandier
case
to
enable
me
to
go
on
to
the
really
dramatic
denouement
of
this
day
when
the
trial
was
resumed
maitre
henri
robert
questioned
daddy
mathieu
as
to
his
complicity
in
the
death
of
the
keeper
his
wife
was
also
brought
in
and
was
confronted
by
her
husband
she
burst
into
tears
and
confessed
that
she
had
been
the
keeper
s
mistress
and
that
her
husband
had
suspected
it
she
again
however
affirmed
that
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
of
her
lover
maitre
henri
robert
thereupon
asked
the
court
to
hear
frederic
larsan
on
this
point
in
a
short
conversation
which
i
have
had
with
frederic
larsan
during
the
adjournment
declared
the
advocate
he
has
made
me
understand
that
the
death
of
the
keeper
may
have
been
brought
about
otherwise
than
by
the
hand
of
mathieu
it
will
be
interesting
to
hear
frederic
larsan
s
frederic
larsan
was
brought
in
his
explanation
was
quite
clear
i
see
no
necessity
he
said
for
bringing
mathieu
in
this
i
have
told
monsieur
de
marquet
that
the
man
s
threats
had
biassed
the
examining
magistrate
against
him
to
me
the
attempt
to
murder
mademoiselle
and
the
death
of
the
keeper
are
the
work
of
one
and
the
same
person
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
murderer
flying
through
the
court
was
fired
on
it
was
thought
he
was
struck
perhaps
killed
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
only
stumbled
at
the
moment
of
his
disappearance
behind
the
corner
of
the
right
wing
of
the
chateau
there
he
encountered
the
keeper
who
no
doubt
tried
to
seize
him
the
murderer
had
in
his
hand
the
knife
with
which
he
had
stabbed
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
with
this
he
killed
the
this
very
simple
explanation
appeared
at
once
plausible
and
satisfying
a
murmur
of
approbation
was
heard
and
the
murderer
what
became
of
him
asked
the
president
he
was
evidently
hidden
in
an
obscure
corner
at
the
end
of
the
court
after
the
people
had
left
the
court
carrying
with
them
the
body
of
the
keeper
the
murderer
quietly
made
his
the
words
had
scarcely
left
larsan
s
mouth
when
from
the
back
of
the
court
came
a
youthful
voice
i
agree
with
frederic
larsan
as
to
the
death
of
the
keeper
but
i
do
not
agree
with
him
as
to
the
way
the
murderer
escaped
everybody
turned
round
astonished
the
clerks
of
the
court
sprang
towards
the
speaker
calling
out
silence
and
the
president
angrily
ordered
the
intruder
to
be
immediately
expelled
the
same
clear
voice
however
was
again
heard
it
is
i
monsieur
president
joseph
rouletabille
chapter
xxvii
in
which
joseph
rouletabille
appears
in
all
his
glory
the
excitement
was
extreme
cries
from
fainting
women
were
to
be
heard
amid
the
extraordinary
bustle
and
stir
the
majesty
of
the
law
was
utterly
forgotten
the
president
tried
in
vain
to
make
himself
heard
rouletabille
made
his
way
forward
with
difficulty
but
by
dint
of
much
elbowing
reached
his
manager
and
greeted
him
cordially
the
letter
was
passed
to
him
and
pocketing
it
he
turned
to
the
he
was
dressed
exactly
as
on
the
day
he
left
me
even
to
the
ulster
over
his
arm
turning
to
the
president
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
president
but
i
have
only
just
arrived
from
america
the
steamer
was
late
my
name
is
joseph
rouletabille
the
silence
which
followed
his
stepping
into
the
was
broken
by
laughter
when
his
words
were
heard
everybody
seemed
relieved
and
glad
to
find
him
there
as
if
in
the
expectation
of
hearing
the
truth
at
last
but
the
president
was
extremely
incensed
so
you
are
joseph
rouletabille
he
replied
well
young
man
i
ll
teach
you
what
comes
of
making
a
farce
of
justice
by
virtue
of
my
discretionary
power
i
hold
you
at
the
court
s
i
ask
nothing
better
monsieur
president
i
have
come
here
for
that
purpose
i
humbly
beg
the
court
s
pardon
for
the
disturbance
of
which
i
have
been
the
innocent
cause
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
nobody
has
a
greater
respect
for
the
court
than
i
have
i
came
in
as
i
he
smiled
take
him
away
ordered
the
president
maitre
henri
robert
intervened
he
began
by
apologising
for
the
young
man
who
he
said
was
moved
only
by
the
best
intentions
he
made
the
president
understand
that
the
evidence
of
a
witness
who
had
slept
at
the
glandier
during
the
whole
of
that
eventful
week
could
not
be
omitted
and
the
present
witness
moreover
had
come
to
name
the
real
murderer
are
you
going
to
tell
us
who
the
murderer
was
asked
the
president
somewhat
convinced
though
still
sceptical
i
have
come
for
that
purpose
monsieur
president
replied
rouletabille
an
attempt
at
applause
was
silenced
by
the
usher
joseph
rouletabille
said
maitre
henri
robert
has
not
been
regularly
subpoenaed
as
a
witness
but
i
hope
monsieur
president
you
will
examine
him
in
virtue
of
your
discretionary
very
well
said
the
president
we
will
question
him
but
we
must
proceed
in
the
rose
it
would
perhaps
be
better
he
said
if
the
young
man
were
to
tell
us
now
whom
he
the
president
nodded
ironically
if
the
attaches
importance
to
the
deposition
of
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
i
see
no
reason
why
this
witness
should
not
give
us
the
name
of
the
a
pin
drop
could
have
been
heard
rouletabille
stood
silent
looking
sympathetically
at
darzac
who
for
the
first
time
since
the
opening
of
the
trial
showed
himself
agitated
well
cried
the
president
we
wait
for
the
name
of
the
rouletabille
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
drew
his
watch
and
looking
at
it
said
monsieur
president
i
can
not
name
the
murderer
before
six
o
clock
loud
murmurs
of
disappointment
filled
the
room
some
of
the
lawyers
were
heard
to
say
he
s
making
fun
of
us
the
president
in
a
stern
voice
said
this
joke
has
gone
far
enough
you
may
retire
monsieur
into
the
witnesses
room
i
hold
you
at
our
rouletabille
protested
i
assure
you
monsieur
president
he
cried
in
his
sharp
clear
voice
that
when
i
do
name
the
murderer
you
will
understand
why
i
could
not
speak
before
six
i
assert
this
on
my
honour
i
can
however
give
you
now
some
explanation
of
the
murder
of
the
keeper
monsieur
frederic
larsan
who
has
seen
me
at
work
at
the
glandier
can
tell
you
with
what
care
i
studied
this
case
i
found
myself
compelled
to
differ
with
him
in
arresting
monsieur
robert
darzac
who
is
innocent
monsieur
larsan
knows
of
my
good
faith
and
knows
that
some
importance
may
be
attached
to
my
discoveries
which
have
often
corroborated
his
frederic
larsan
said
monsieur
president
it
will
be
interesting
to
hear
monsieur
joseph
rouletabille
especially
as
he
differs
from
a
murmur
of
approbation
greeted
the
detective
s
speech
he
was
a
good
sportsman
and
accepted
the
challenge
the
struggle
between
the
two
promised
to
be
exciting
as
the
president
remained
silent
frederic
larsan
continued
we
agree
that
the
murderer
of
the
keeper
was
the
assailant
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
as
we
are
not
agreed
as
to
how
the
murderer
escaped
i
am
curious
to
hear
monsieur
rouletabille
s
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
said
my
friend
general
laughter
followed
this
remark
the
president
angrily
declared
that
if
it
was
repeated
he
would
have
the
court
cleared
now
young
man
said
the
president
you
have
heard
monsieur
frederic
larsan
how
did
the
murderer
get
away
from
the
court
rouletabille
looked
at
madame
mathieu
who
smiled
back
at
him
sadly
since
madame
mathieu
he
said
has
freely
admitted
her
intimacy
with
the
keeper
why
it
s
the
boy
exclaimed
daddy
mathieu
remove
that
man
ordered
the
president
mathieu
was
removed
from
the
court
rouletabille
went
on
since
she
has
made
this
confession
i
am
free
to
tell
you
that
she
often
met
the
keeper
at
night
on
the
first
floor
of
the
donjon
in
the
room
which
was
once
an
oratory
these
meetings
became
more
frequent
when
her
husband
was
laid
up
by
his
rheumatism
she
gave
him
morphine
to
ease
his
pain
and
to
give
herself
more
time
for
the
meetings
madame
mathieu
came
to
the
chateau
that
night
enveloped
in
a
large
black
shawl
which
served
also
as
a
disguise
this
was
the
phantom
that
disturbed
daddy
jacques
she
knew
how
to
imitate
the
mewing
of
mother
angenoux
cat
and
she
would
make
the
cries
to
advise
the
keeper
of
her
presence
the
recent
repairs
of
the
donjon
did
not
interfere
with
their
meetings
in
the
keeper
s
old
room
in
the
donjon
since
the
new
room
assigned
to
him
at
the
end
of
the
right
wing
was
separated
from
the
steward
s
room
by
a
partition
only
previous
to
the
tragedy
in
the
courtyard
madame
mathieu
and
the
keeper
left
the
donjon
together
i
learnt
these
facts
from
my
examination
of
the
footmarks
in
the
court
the
next
morning
bernier
the
concierge
whom
i
had
stationed
behind
the
donjon
as
he
will
explain
himself
could
not
see
what
passed
in
the
court
he
did
not
reach
the
court
until
he
heard
the
revolver
shots
and
then
he
fired
when
the
woman
parted
from
the
man
she
went
towards
the
open
gate
of
the
court
while
he
returned
to
his
room
he
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
the
revolvers
rang
out
he
had
just
reached
the
corner
when
a
shadow
bounded
by
meanwhile
madame
mathieu
surprised
by
the
revolver
shots
and
by
the
entrance
of
people
into
the
court
crouched
in
the
darkness
the
court
is
a
large
one
and
being
near
the
gate
she
might
easily
have
passed
out
unseen
but
she
remained
and
saw
the
body
being
carried
away
in
great
agony
of
mind
she
neared
the
vestibule
and
saw
the
dead
body
of
her
lover
on
the
stairs
lit
up
by
daddy
jacques
lantern
she
then
fled
and
daddy
jacques
joined
her
that
same
night
before
the
murder
daddy
jacques
had
been
awakened
by
the
cat
s
cry
and
looking
through
his
window
had
seen
the
black
phantom
hastily
dressing
himself
he
went
out
and
recognised
her
he
is
an
old
friend
of
madame
mathieu
and
when
she
saw
him
she
had
to
tell
him
of
her
relations
with
the
keeper
and
begged
his
assistance
daddy
jacques
took
pity
on
her
and
accompanied
her
through
the
oak
grove
out
of
the
park
past
the
border
of
the
lake
to
the
road
to
epinay
from
there
it
was
but
a
very
short
distance
to
her
home
daddy
jacques
returned
to
the
chateau
and
seeing
how
important
it
was
for
madame
mathieu
s
presence
at
the
chateau
to
remain
unknown
he
did
all
he
could
to
hide
it
i
appeal
to
monsieur
larsan
who
saw
me
next
morning
examine
the
two
sets
of
here
rouletabille
turning
towards
madame
mathieu
with
a
bow
said
the
footprints
of
madame
bear
a
strange
resemblance
to
the
neat
footprints
of
the
madame
mathieu
trembled
and
looked
at
him
with
wide
eyes
as
if
in
wonder
at
what
he
would
say
next
madame
has
a
shapely
foot
long
and
rather
large
for
a
woman
the
imprint
with
its
pointed
toe
is
very
like
that
of
the
murderer
a
movement
in
the
court
was
repressed
by
rouletabille
he
held
their
attention
at
once
i
hasten
to
add
he
went
on
that
i
attach
no
importance
to
this
outward
signs
like
these
are
often
liable
to
lead
us
into
error
if
we
do
not
reason
rightly
monsieur
robert
darzac
s
footprints
are
also
like
the
murderer
s
and
yet
he
is
not
the
murderer
the
president
turning
to
madame
mathieu
asked
is
that
in
accordance
with
what
you
know
occurred
yes
monsieur
president
she
replied
it
is
as
if
monsieur
rouletabille
had
been
behind
did
you
see
the
murderer
running
towards
the
end
of
the
right
wing
yes
as
clearly
as
i
saw
them
afterwards
carrying
the
keeper
s
what
became
of
the
murderer
you
were
in
the
courtyard
and
could
easily
have
seen
i
saw
nothing
of
him
monsieur
president
it
became
quite
dark
just
then
monsieur
rouletabille
said
the
president
must
explain
how
the
murderer
made
his
rouletabille
continued
it
was
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
escape
by
the
way
he
had
entered
the
court
without
our
seeing
him
or
if
we
couldn
t
see
him
we
must
certainly
have
felt
him
since
the
court
is
a
very
narrow
one
enclosed
in
high
iron
then
if
the
man
was
hemmed
in
that
narrow
square
how
is
it
you
did
not
find
him
i
have
been
asking
you
that
for
the
last
half
monsieur
president
replied
rouletabille
i
can
not
answer
that
question
before
six
by
this
time
the
people
in
the
were
beginning
to
believe
in
this
new
witness
they
were
amused
by
his
melodramatic
action
in
thus
fixing
the
hour
but
they
seemed
to
have
confidence
in
the
outcome
as
for
the
president
it
looked
as
if
he
also
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
the
young
man
in
the
same
way
he
had
certainly
been
impressed
by
rouletabille
s
explanation
of
madame
mathieu
s
part
well
monsieur
rouletabille
he
said
as
you
say
but
don
t
let
us
see
any
more
of
you
before
rouletabille
bowed
to
the
president
and
made
his
way
to
the
door
of
the
witnesses
room
i
quietly
made
my
way
through
the
crowd
and
left
the
court
almost
at
the
same
time
as
rouletabille
he
greeted
me
heartily
and
looked
happy
i
ll
not
ask
you
my
dear
fellow
i
said
smiling
what
you
ve
been
doing
in
america
because
i
ve
no
doubt
you
ll
say
you
can
t
tell
me
until
after
no
my
dear
sainclair
i
ll
tell
you
right
now
why
i
went
to
america
i
went
in
search
of
the
name
of
the
other
half
of
the
murderer
the
name
of
the
other
half
exactly
when
we
last
left
the
glandier
i
knew
there
were
two
halves
to
the
murderer
and
the
name
of
only
one
of
them
i
went
to
america
for
the
name
of
the
other
i
was
too
puzzled
to
answer
just
then
we
entered
the
witnesses
room
and
rouletabille
was
immediately
surrounded
he
showed
himself
very
friendly
to
all
except
arthur
rance
to
whom
he
exhibited
a
marked
coldness
of
manner
frederic
larsan
came
in
also
rouletabille
went
up
and
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
his
manner
toward
the
detective
showed
that
he
had
got
the
better
of
the
policeman
larsan
smiled
and
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
in
america
rouletabille
began
by
telling
him
some
anecdotes
of
his
voyage
they
then
turned
aside
together
apparently
with
the
object
of
speaking
confidentially
i
therefore
discreetly
left
them
and
being
curious
to
hear
the
evidence
returned
to
my
seat
in
the
where
the
public
plainly
showed
its
lack
of
interest
in
what
was
going
on
in
their
impatience
for
rouletabille
s
return
at
the
appointed
time
on
the
stroke
of
six
joseph
rouletabille
was
again
brought
in
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
picture
the
tense
excitement
which
appeared
on
every
face
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
bar
darzac
rose
to
his
feet
frightfully
pale
the
president
addressing
rouletabille
said
gravely
i
will
not
ask
you
to
take
the
oath
because
you
have
not
been
regularly
summoned
but
i
trust
there
is
no
need
to
urge
upon
you
the
gravity
of
the
statement
you
are
about
to
rouletabille
looked
the
president
quite
calmly
and
steadily
in
the
face
and
replied
yes
at
your
last
appearance
here
said
the
president
we
had
arrived
at
the
point
where
you
were
to
tell
us
how
the
murderer
escaped
and
also
his
name
now
monsieur
rouletabille
we
await
your
very
well
monsieur
began
my
friend
amidst
a
profound
silence
i
had
explained
how
it
was
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
get
away
without
being
seen
and
yet
he
was
there
with
us
in
the
and
you
did
not
see
him
at
least
that
is
what
the
prosecution
no
we
all
of
us
saw
him
monsieur
le
president
cried
rouletabille
then
why
was
he
not
arrested
because
no
one
besides
myself
knew
that
he
was
the
murderer
it
would
have
spoiled
my
plans
to
have
had
him
arrested
and
i
had
then
no
proof
other
than
my
own
reasoning
i
was
convinced
we
had
the
murderer
before
us
and
that
we
were
actually
looking
at
him
i
have
now
brought
what
i
consider
the
indisputable
speak
out
monsieur
tell
us
the
murderer
s
you
will
find
it
on
the
list
of
names
present
in
the
court
on
the
night
of
the
tragedy
replied
rouletabille
the
people
present
in
the
began
showing
impatience
some
of
them
even
called
for
the
name
and
were
silenced
by
the
usher
the
list
includes
daddy
jacques
bernier
the
concierge
and
arthur
rance
said
the
president
do
you
accuse
any
of
these
no
monsieur
then
i
do
not
understand
what
you
are
driving
at
there
was
no
other
person
at
the
end
of
the
yes
monsieur
there
was
not
at
the
end
but
above
the
court
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
do
you
mean
frederic
larsan
exclaimed
the
president
yes
frederic
larsan
replied
rouletabille
in
a
ringing
tone
frederic
larsan
is
the
murderer
the
became
immediately
filled
with
loud
and
indignant
protests
so
astonished
was
he
that
the
president
did
not
attempt
to
quiet
it
the
quick
silence
which
followed
was
broken
by
the
distinctly
whispered
words
from
the
lips
of
robert
darzac
it
s
impossible
he
s
mad
you
dare
to
accuse
frederic
larsan
monsieur
asked
the
president
if
you
are
not
mad
what
are
your
proofs
proofs
monsieur
do
you
want
proofs
well
here
is
one
cried
rouletabille
shrilly
let
frederic
larsan
be
called
usher
call
frederic
the
usher
hurried
to
the
side
door
opened
it
and
disappeared
the
door
remained
open
while
all
eyes
turned
expectantly
towards
it
the
clerk
and
stepping
forward
said
monsieur
president
frederic
larsan
is
not
here
he
left
at
about
four
o
clock
and
has
not
been
seen
that
is
my
proof
cried
rouletabille
triumphantly
explain
yourself
demanded
the
president
my
proof
is
larsan
s
flight
said
the
young
reporter
he
will
not
come
back
you
will
see
no
more
of
frederic
unless
you
are
playing
with
the
court
monsieur
why
did
you
not
accuse
him
when
he
was
present
he
would
then
have
answered
he
could
give
no
other
answer
than
the
one
he
has
now
given
by
his
we
can
not
believe
that
larsan
has
fled
there
was
no
reason
for
his
doing
so
did
he
know
you
d
make
this
charge
he
did
i
told
him
i
do
you
mean
to
say
that
knowing
larsan
was
the
murderer
you
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
escape
yes
monsieur
president
i
did
replied
rouletabille
proudly
i
am
not
a
policeman
i
am
a
journalist
and
my
business
is
not
to
arrest
people
my
business
is
in
the
service
of
truth
and
is
not
that
of
an
executioner
if
you
are
just
monsieur
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
you
can
now
understand
why
i
refrained
until
this
hour
to
divulge
the
name
i
gave
larsan
time
to
catch
the
train
for
paris
where
he
would
know
where
to
hide
himself
and
leave
no
traces
you
will
not
find
frederic
larsan
declared
rouletabille
fixing
his
eyes
on
monsieur
robert
darzac
he
is
too
cunning
he
is
a
man
who
has
always
escaped
you
and
whom
you
have
long
searched
for
in
vain
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
outwitting
me
he
can
yet
easily
outwit
any
police
this
man
who
four
years
ago
introduced
himself
to
the
surete
and
became
celebrated
as
frederic
larsan
is
notorious
under
another
name
a
name
well
known
to
crime
frederic
larsan
monsieur
president
is
ballmeyer
ballmeyer
cried
the
president
ballmeyer
exclaimed
robert
darzac
springing
to
his
feet
ballmeyer
it
was
true
then
ah
monsieur
darzac
you
don
t
think
i
am
mad
now
cried
rouletabille
ballmeyer
ballmeyer
no
other
word
could
be
heard
in
the
courtroom
the
president
adjourned
the
hearing
those
of
my
readers
who
may
not
have
heard
of
ballmeyer
will
wonder
at
the
excitement
the
name
caused
and
yet
the
doings
of
this
remarkable
criminal
form
the
of
the
most
dramatic
narratives
of
the
newspapers
and
criminal
records
of
the
past
twenty
years
it
had
been
reported
that
he
was
dead
and
thus
had
eluded
the
police
as
he
had
eluded
them
throughout
the
whole
of
his
career
ballmeyer
was
the
best
specimen
of
the
gentleman
he
was
adept
at
sleight
of
hand
tricks
and
no
bolder
or
more
ruthless
crook
ever
lived
he
was
received
in
the
best
society
and
was
a
member
of
some
of
the
most
exclusive
clubs
on
many
of
his
depredatory
expeditions
he
had
not
hesitated
to
use
the
knife
and
the
no
difficulty
stopped
him
and
no
operation
was
too
dangerous
he
had
been
caught
but
escaped
on
the
very
morning
of
his
trial
by
throwing
pepper
into
the
eyes
of
the
guards
who
were
conducting
him
to
court
it
was
known
later
that
in
spite
of
the
keen
hunt
after
him
by
the
most
expert
of
detectives
he
had
sat
that
same
evening
at
a
first
performance
in
the
theatre
francais
without
the
slightest
disguise
he
left
france
later
to
work
america
the
police
there
succeeded
in
capturing
him
once
but
the
extraordinary
man
escaped
the
next
day
it
would
need
a
volume
to
recount
the
adventures
of
this
and
yet
this
was
the
man
rouletabille
had
allowed
to
get
away
knowing
all
about
him
and
who
he
was
he
afforded
the
criminal
an
opportunity
for
another
laugh
at
the
society
he
had
defied
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
bold
stroke
of
the
young
journalist
because
i
felt
certain
his
motive
had
been
to
protect
both
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
rid
darzac
of
an
enemy
at
the
same
time
the
crowd
had
barely
recovered
from
the
effect
of
the
astonishing
revelation
when
the
hearing
was
resumed
the
question
in
everybody
s
mind
was
admitting
that
larsan
was
the
murderer
how
did
he
get
out
of
the
yellow
room
rouletabille
was
immediately
called
to
the
bar
and
his
examination
continued
you
have
told
us
said
the
president
that
it
was
impossible
to
escape
from
the
end
of
the
court
since
larsan
was
leaning
out
of
his
window
he
had
left
the
court
how
did
he
do
that
he
escaped
by
a
most
unusual
way
he
climbed
the
wall
sprang
onto
the
terrace
and
while
we
were
engaged
with
the
keeper
s
body
reached
the
gallery
by
the
window
he
then
had
little
else
to
do
than
to
open
the
window
get
in
and
call
out
to
us
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
his
own
room
to
a
man
of
ballmeyer
s
strength
all
that
was
mere
child
s
play
and
here
monsieur
is
the
proof
of
what
i
rouletabille
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
packet
from
which
he
produced
a
strong
iron
peg
this
monsieur
he
said
is
a
spike
which
perfectly
fits
a
hole
still
to
be
seen
in
the
cornice
supporting
the
terrace
larsan
who
thought
and
prepared
for
everything
in
case
of
any
emergency
had
fixed
this
spike
into
the
cornice
all
he
had
to
do
to
make
his
escape
good
was
to
plant
one
foot
on
a
stone
which
is
placed
at
the
corner
of
the
chateau
another
on
this
support
one
hand
on
the
cornice
of
the
keeper
s
door
and
the
other
on
the
terrace
and
larsan
was
clear
of
the
ground
the
rest
was
easy
his
acting
after
dinner
as
if
he
had
been
drugged
was
make
believe
he
was
not
drugged
but
he
did
drug
me
of
course
he
had
to
make
it
appear
as
if
he
also
had
been
drugged
so
that
no
suspicion
should
fall
on
him
for
my
condition
had
i
not
been
thus
overpowered
larsan
would
never
have
entered
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
that
night
and
the
attack
on
her
would
not
have
taken
a
groan
came
from
darzac
who
appeared
to
be
unable
to
control
his
suffering
you
can
understand
added
rouletabille
that
larsan
would
feel
himself
hampered
from
the
fact
that
my
room
was
so
close
to
his
and
from
a
suspicion
that
i
would
be
on
the
watch
that
night
naturally
he
could
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
i
suspected
him
but
i
might
see
him
leaving
his
room
when
he
was
about
to
go
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
waited
till
i
was
asleep
and
my
friend
sainclair
was
busy
trying
to
rouse
me
ten
minutes
after
that
mademoiselle
was
calling
out
murder
how
did
you
come
to
suspect
larsan
asked
the
president
my
pure
reason
pointed
to
him
that
was
why
i
watched
him
but
i
did
not
foresee
the
drugging
he
is
very
cunning
yes
my
pure
reason
pointed
to
him
but
i
required
tangible
proof
so
that
my
eyes
could
see
him
as
my
pure
reason
saw
what
do
you
mean
by
your
pure
reason
that
power
of
one
s
mind
which
admits
of
no
disturbing
elements
to
a
conclusion
the
day
following
the
incident
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
i
felt
myself
losing
control
of
it
i
had
allowed
myself
to
be
diverted
by
fallacious
evidence
but
i
recovered
and
again
took
hold
of
the
right
end
i
satisfied
myself
that
the
murderer
could
not
have
left
the
gallery
either
naturally
or
supernaturally
i
narrowed
the
field
of
consideration
to
that
small
circle
so
to
speak
the
murderer
could
not
be
outside
that
circle
now
who
was
in
it
there
was
first
the
murderer
then
there
were
daddy
jacques
monsieur
stangerson
frederic
larsan
and
myself
five
persons
in
all
counting
in
the
murderer
and
yet
in
the
gallery
there
were
but
four
now
since
it
had
been
demonstrated
to
me
that
the
fifth
could
not
have
escaped
it
was
evident
that
one
of
the
four
present
in
the
gallery
must
be
a
double
he
must
be
himself
and
the
murderer
also
why
had
i
not
seen
this
before
simply
because
the
phenomenon
of
the
double
personality
had
not
occurred
before
in
this
inquiry
now
who
of
the
four
persons
in
the
gallery
was
both
that
person
and
the
assassin
i
went
over
in
my
mind
what
i
had
seen
i
had
seen
at
one
and
the
same
time
monsieur
stangerson
and
the
murderer
daddy
jacques
and
the
murderer
myself
and
the
murderer
so
that
the
murderer
then
could
not
be
either
monsieur
stangerson
daddy
jacques
or
myself
had
i
seen
frederic
larsan
and
the
murderer
at
the
same
time
no
two
seconds
had
passed
during
which
i
lost
sight
of
the
murderer
for
as
i
have
noted
in
my
papers
he
arrived
two
seconds
before
monsieur
stangerson
daddy
jacques
and
myself
at
the
of
the
two
galleries
that
would
have
given
larsan
time
to
go
through
the
gallery
snatch
off
his
false
beard
return
and
hurry
with
us
as
if
like
us
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
i
was
sure
now
i
had
got
hold
of
the
right
end
in
my
reasoning
with
frederic
larsan
was
now
always
associated
in
my
mind
the
personality
of
the
unknown
of
whom
i
was
in
pursuit
the
murderer
in
other
words
that
revelation
staggered
me
i
tried
to
regain
my
balance
by
going
over
the
evidences
previously
traced
but
which
had
diverted
my
mind
and
led
me
away
from
frederic
larsan
what
were
these
evidences
i
had
seen
the
unknown
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
on
going
to
frederic
larsan
s
room
i
had
found
larsan
sound
asleep
the
ladder
i
had
placed
frederic
larsan
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
and
had
told
him
that
i
would
rush
into
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
to
try
to
capture
the
murderer
then
i
returned
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
where
i
had
seen
the
unknown
the
first
evidence
did
not
disturb
me
much
it
is
likely
that
when
i
descended
from
my
ladder
after
having
seen
the
unknown
in
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
chamber
larsan
had
already
finished
what
he
was
doing
there
then
while
i
was
the
chateau
larsan
went
back
to
his
own
room
and
undressing
himself
went
to
sleep
nor
did
the
second
evidence
trouble
me
if
larsan
were
the
murderer
he
could
have
no
use
for
a
ladder
but
the
ladder
might
have
been
placed
there
to
give
an
appearance
to
the
murderer
s
entrance
from
without
the
chateau
especially
as
larsan
had
accused
darzac
and
darzac
was
not
in
the
chateau
that
night
further
the
ladder
might
have
been
placed
there
to
facilitate
larsan
s
flight
in
case
of
absolute
necessity
but
the
third
evidence
puzzled
me
altogether
having
placed
larsan
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
i
could
not
explain
how
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
when
i
had
gone
to
the
left
wing
of
the
chateau
to
find
monsieur
stangerson
and
daddy
jacques
to
return
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
it
was
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
do
he
risked
being
captured
and
he
knew
it
and
he
was
very
nearly
captured
he
had
not
had
time
to
regain
his
post
as
he
had
certainly
hoped
to
do
he
had
then
a
very
strong
reason
for
returning
to
his
room
as
for
myself
when
i
sent
daddy
jacques
to
the
end
of
the
right
gallery
i
naturally
thought
that
larsan
was
still
at
his
post
daddy
jacques
in
going
to
his
post
had
not
looked
when
he
passed
to
see
whether
larsan
was
at
his
post
or
not
what
then
was
the
urgent
reason
which
had
compelled
larsan
to
go
to
the
room
a
second
time
i
guessed
it
to
be
some
evidence
of
his
presence
there
he
had
left
something
very
important
in
that
room
what
was
it
and
had
he
recovered
it
i
begged
madame
bernier
who
was
accustomed
to
clean
the
room
to
look
and
she
found
a
pair
of
this
pair
monsieur
president
and
rouletabille
drew
the
of
which
we
know
from
his
pocket
when
i
saw
these
he
continued
i
was
utterly
nonplussed
i
had
never
seen
larsan
wear
what
did
they
mean
suddenly
i
exclaimed
to
myself
i
wonder
if
he
is
i
had
never
seen
larsan
write
he
might
then
be
they
would
certainly
know
at
the
surete
and
also
know
if
the
glasses
were
his
such
evidence
would
be
damning
that
explained
larsan
s
return
i
know
now
that
larsan
or
ballmeyer
is
and
that
these
glasses
belonged
to
him
i
now
made
one
mistake
i
was
not
satisfied
with
the
evidence
i
had
obtained
i
wished
to
see
the
man
s
face
had
i
refrained
from
this
the
second
terrible
attack
would
not
have
but
asked
the
president
why
should
larsan
go
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
at
all
why
should
he
twice
attempt
to
murder
her
because
he
loves
her
monsieur
that
is
certainly
a
reason
but
it
is
the
only
reason
he
was
madly
in
love
and
because
of
that
and
other
things
he
was
capable
of
committing
any
did
mademoiselle
stangerson
know
this
yes
monsieur
but
she
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
man
who
was
pursuing
her
was
frederic
larsan
otherwise
of
course
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
be
at
the
chateau
i
noticed
when
he
was
in
her
room
after
the
incident
in
the
gallery
that
he
kept
himself
in
the
shadow
and
that
he
kept
his
head
bent
down
he
was
looking
for
the
lost
mademoiselle
stangerson
knew
larsan
under
another
monsieur
darzac
asked
the
president
did
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
any
way
confide
in
you
on
this
matter
how
is
it
that
she
has
never
spoken
about
it
to
anyone
if
you
are
innocent
she
would
have
wished
to
spare
you
the
pain
of
being
mademoiselle
stangerson
told
me
nothing
replied
monsieur
darzac
does
what
this
young
man
says
appear
probable
to
you
the
president
asked
mademoiselle
stangerson
has
told
me
nothing
he
replied
stolidly
how
do
you
explain
that
on
the
night
of
the
murder
of
the
keeper
the
president
asked
turning
to
rouletabille
the
murderer
brought
back
the
papers
stolen
from
monsieur
stangerson
how
do
you
explain
how
the
murderer
gained
entrance
into
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
locked
room
the
last
question
is
easily
answered
a
man
like
larsan
or
ballmeyer
could
have
had
made
duplicate
keys
as
to
the
documents
i
think
larsan
had
not
intended
to
steal
them
at
first
closely
watching
mademoiselle
with
the
purpose
of
preventing
her
marriage
with
monsieur
robert
darzac
he
one
day
followed
her
and
monsieur
into
the
grands
magasins
de
la
louvre
there
he
got
possession
of
the
reticule
which
she
lost
or
left
behind
in
that
reticule
was
a
key
with
a
brass
head
he
did
not
know
there
was
any
value
attached
to
the
key
till
the
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
revealed
it
he
then
wrote
to
mademoiselle
as
the
advertisement
requested
no
doubt
he
asked
for
a
meeting
making
known
to
her
that
he
was
also
the
person
who
had
for
some
time
pursued
her
with
his
love
he
received
no
answer
he
went
to
the
post
office
and
ascertained
that
his
letter
was
no
longer
there
he
had
already
taken
complete
stock
of
monsieur
darzac
and
having
decided
to
go
to
any
lengths
to
gain
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
had
planned
that
whatever
might
happen
monsieur
darzac
his
hated
rival
should
be
the
man
to
be
suspected
i
do
not
think
that
larsan
had
as
yet
thought
of
murdering
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
whatever
he
might
do
he
made
sure
that
monsieur
darzac
should
suffer
for
it
he
was
very
nearly
of
the
same
height
as
monsieur
darzac
and
had
almost
the
same
sized
feet
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
take
an
impression
of
monsieur
darzac
s
footprints
and
have
similar
boots
made
for
himself
such
tricks
were
mere
child
s
play
for
larsan
or
ballmeyer
receiving
no
reply
to
his
letter
he
determined
since
mademoiselle
stangerson
would
not
come
to
him
that
he
would
go
to
her
his
plan
had
long
been
formed
he
had
made
himself
master
of
the
plans
of
the
chateau
and
the
pavilion
so
that
one
afternoon
while
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
were
out
for
a
walk
and
while
daddy
jacques
was
away
he
entered
the
latter
by
the
vestibule
window
he
was
alone
and
being
in
no
hurry
he
began
examining
the
furniture
one
of
the
pieces
resembling
a
safe
had
a
very
small
keyhole
that
interested
him
he
had
with
him
the
little
key
with
the
brass
head
and
associating
one
with
the
other
he
tried
the
key
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
he
saw
nothing
but
papers
they
must
be
very
valuable
to
have
been
put
away
in
a
safe
and
the
key
to
which
to
be
of
so
much
importance
perhaps
a
thought
of
blackmail
occurred
to
him
as
a
useful
possibility
in
helping
him
in
his
designs
on
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
quickly
made
a
parcel
of
the
papers
and
took
it
to
the
lavatory
in
the
vestibule
between
the
time
of
his
first
examination
of
the
pavilion
and
the
night
of
the
murder
of
the
keeper
larsan
had
had
time
to
find
out
what
those
papers
contained
he
could
do
nothing
with
them
and
they
were
rather
compromising
that
night
he
took
them
back
to
the
chateau
perhaps
he
hoped
that
by
returning
the
papers
he
might
obtain
some
gratitude
from
mademoiselle
stangerson
but
whatever
may
have
been
his
reasons
he
took
the
papers
back
and
so
rid
himself
of
an
rouletabille
coughed
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
was
embarrassed
he
had
arrived
at
a
point
where
he
had
to
keep
back
his
knowledge
of
larsan
s
true
motive
the
explanation
he
had
given
had
evidently
been
unsatisfactory
rouletabille
was
quick
enough
to
note
the
bad
impression
he
had
made
for
turning
to
the
president
he
said
and
now
we
come
to
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
a
movement
of
chairs
in
the
court
with
a
rustling
of
dresses
and
an
energetic
whispering
of
hush
showed
the
curiosity
that
had
been
aroused
it
seems
to
me
said
the
president
that
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
monsieur
rouletabille
is
wholly
explained
by
your
hypothesis
frederic
larsan
is
the
explanation
we
have
merely
to
substitute
him
for
monsieur
robert
darzac
evidently
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
was
open
at
the
time
monsieur
stangerson
was
alone
and
that
he
allowed
the
man
who
was
coming
out
of
his
daughter
s
chamber
to
pass
without
arresting
him
perhaps
at
her
entreaty
to
avoid
all
no
monsieur
president
protested
the
young
man
you
forget
that
stunned
by
the
attack
made
on
her
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
not
in
a
condition
to
have
made
such
an
appeal
nor
could
she
have
locked
and
bolted
herself
in
her
room
you
must
also
remember
that
monsieur
stangerson
has
sworn
that
the
door
was
not
that
however
is
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
explained
the
yellow
room
was
as
closely
shut
as
an
iron
safe
to
use
your
own
expression
it
was
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
make
his
escape
either
naturally
or
supernaturally
when
the
room
was
broken
into
he
was
not
there
he
must
therefore
have
that
does
not
what
do
you
mean
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
escape
if
he
was
not
there
not
there
evidently
not
he
could
not
have
been
there
if
he
were
not
found
but
what
about
the
evidences
of
his
presence
asked
the
president
that
monsieur
president
is
where
we
have
taken
hold
of
the
wrong
end
from
the
time
mademoiselle
stangerson
shut
herself
in
the
room
to
the
time
her
door
was
burst
open
it
was
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
escape
he
was
not
found
because
he
was
not
there
during
that
but
the
evidences
they
have
led
us
astray
in
reasoning
on
this
mystery
we
must
not
take
them
to
mean
what
they
apparently
mean
why
do
we
conclude
the
murderer
was
there
because
he
left
his
tracks
in
the
room
good
but
may
he
not
have
been
there
before
the
room
was
locked
nay
he
must
have
been
there
before
let
us
look
into
the
matter
of
these
traces
and
see
if
they
do
not
point
to
my
conclusion
after
the
publication
of
the
article
in
the
matin
and
my
conversation
with
the
examining
magistrate
on
the
journey
from
paris
to
i
was
certain
that
the
yellow
room
had
been
hermetically
sealed
so
to
speak
and
that
consequently
the
murderer
had
escaped
before
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
gone
into
her
chamber
at
midnight
at
the
time
i
was
much
puzzled
mademoiselle
stangerson
could
not
have
been
her
own
murderer
since
the
evidences
pointed
to
some
other
person
the
assassin
then
had
come
before
if
that
were
so
how
was
it
that
mademoiselle
had
been
attacked
after
or
rather
that
she
appeared
to
have
been
attacked
after
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
reconstruct
the
occurrence
and
make
of
it
two
phases
each
separated
from
the
other
in
time
by
the
space
of
several
hours
one
phase
in
which
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
really
been
attacked
the
other
phase
in
which
those
who
heard
her
cries
thought
she
was
being
attacked
i
had
not
then
examined
the
yellow
room
what
were
the
marks
on
mademoiselle
stangerson
there
were
marks
of
strangulation
and
the
wound
from
a
hard
blow
on
the
temple
the
marks
of
strangulation
did
not
interest
me
much
they
might
have
been
made
before
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
could
have
concealed
them
by
a
collarette
or
any
similar
article
of
apparel
i
had
to
suppose
this
the
moment
i
was
compelled
to
reconstruct
the
occurrence
by
two
phases
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
no
doubt
her
own
reasons
for
so
doing
since
she
had
told
her
father
nothing
of
it
and
had
made
it
understood
to
the
examining
magistrate
that
the
attack
had
taken
place
in
the
night
during
the
second
phase
she
was
forced
to
say
that
otherwise
her
father
would
have
questioned
her
as
to
her
reason
for
having
said
nothing
about
it
but
i
could
not
explain
the
blow
on
the
temple
i
understood
it
even
less
when
i
learned
that
the
had
been
found
in
her
room
she
could
not
hide
the
fact
that
she
had
been
struck
on
the
head
and
yet
that
wound
appeared
evidently
to
have
been
inflicted
during
the
first
phase
since
it
required
the
presence
of
the
murderer
i
thought
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
hidden
the
wound
by
arranging
her
hair
in
bands
on
her
forehead
as
to
the
mark
of
the
hand
on
the
wall
that
had
evidently
been
made
during
the
first
phase
when
the
murderer
was
really
there
all
the
traces
of
his
presence
had
naturally
been
left
during
the
first
phase
the
the
black
footprints
the
basque
cap
the
handkerchief
the
blood
on
the
wall
on
the
door
and
on
the
floor
if
those
traces
were
still
all
there
they
showed
that
mademoiselle
stangerson
who
desired
that
nothing
should
be
known
had
not
yet
had
time
to
clear
them
away
this
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
the
two
phases
had
taken
place
one
shortly
after
the
other
she
had
not
had
the
opportunity
after
leaving
her
room
and
going
back
to
the
laboratory
to
her
father
to
get
back
again
to
her
room
and
put
it
in
order
her
father
was
all
the
time
with
her
working
so
that
after
the
first
phase
she
did
not
her
chamber
till
midnight
daddy
jacques
was
there
at
ten
o
clock
as
he
was
every
night
but
he
went
in
merely
to
close
the
blinds
and
light
the
owing
to
her
disturbed
state
of
mind
she
had
forgotten
that
daddy
jacques
would
go
into
her
room
and
had
begged
him
not
to
trouble
himself
all
this
was
set
forth
in
the
article
in
the
daddy
jacques
did
go
however
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
room
saw
nothing
mademoiselle
stangerson
must
have
lived
some
anxious
moments
while
daddy
jacques
was
absent
but
i
think
she
was
not
aware
that
so
many
evidences
had
been
left
after
she
had
been
attacked
she
had
only
time
to
hide
the
traces
of
the
man
s
fingers
on
her
neck
and
to
hurry
to
the
laboratory
had
she
known
of
the
bone
the
cap
and
the
handkerchief
she
would
have
made
away
with
them
after
she
had
gone
back
to
her
chamber
at
midnight
she
did
not
see
them
and
undressed
by
the
uncertain
glimmer
of
the
night
light
she
went
to
bed
by
anxiety
and
fear
a
fear
that
had
made
her
remain
in
the
laboratory
as
late
as
possible
my
reasoning
had
thus
brought
me
to
the
second
phase
of
the
tragedy
when
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
alone
in
the
room
i
had
now
to
explain
the
revolver
shots
fired
during
the
second
phase
cries
of
help
murder
had
been
heard
how
to
explain
these
as
to
the
cries
i
was
in
no
difficulty
since
she
was
alone
in
her
room
these
could
result
from
nightmare
only
my
explanation
of
the
struggle
and
noise
that
were
heard
is
simply
that
in
her
nightmare
she
was
haunted
by
the
terrible
experience
she
had
passed
through
in
the
afternoon
in
her
dream
she
sees
the
murderer
about
to
spring
upon
her
and
she
cries
help
murder
her
hand
wildly
seeks
the
revolver
she
had
placed
within
her
reach
on
the
by
the
side
of
her
bed
but
her
hand
striking
the
table
overturns
it
and
the
revolver
falling
to
the
floor
discharges
itself
the
bullet
lodging
in
the
ceiling
i
knew
from
the
first
that
the
bullet
in
the
ceiling
must
have
resulted
from
an
accident
its
very
position
suggested
an
accident
to
my
mind
and
so
fell
in
with
my
theory
of
a
nightmare
i
no
longer
doubted
that
the
attack
had
taken
place
before
mademoiselle
had
retired
for
the
night
after
wakening
from
her
frightful
dream
and
crying
aloud
for
help
she
had
fainted
my
theory
based
on
the
evidence
of
the
shots
that
were
heard
at
midnight
demanded
two
shots
one
which
wounded
the
murderer
at
the
time
of
his
attack
and
one
fired
at
the
time
of
the
nightmare
the
evidence
given
by
the
berniers
before
the
examining
magistrate
was
to
the
effect
that
only
one
shot
had
been
heard
monsieur
stangerson
testified
to
hearing
a
dull
sound
first
followed
by
a
sharp
ringing
sound
the
dull
sound
i
explained
by
the
falling
of
the
table
the
ringing
sound
was
the
shot
from
the
revolver
i
was
now
convinced
i
was
right
the
shot
that
had
wounded
the
hand
of
the
murderer
and
had
caused
it
to
bleed
so
that
he
left
the
bloody
imprint
on
the
wall
was
fired
by
mademoiselle
in
before
the
second
phase
when
she
had
been
really
attacked
the
shot
in
the
ceiling
which
the
berniers
heard
was
the
accidental
shot
during
the
nightmare
i
had
now
to
explain
the
wound
on
the
temple
it
was
not
severe
enough
to
have
been
made
by
means
of
the
and
mademoiselle
had
not
attempted
to
hide
it
it
must
have
been
made
during
the
second
phase
it
was
to
find
this
out
that
i
went
to
the
yellow
room
and
i
obtained
my
answer
rouletabille
drew
a
piece
of
white
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
drew
out
of
it
an
almost
invisible
object
which
he
held
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
this
monsieur
president
he
said
is
a
hair
a
blond
hair
stained
with
blood
it
is
a
hair
from
the
head
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
found
it
sticking
to
one
of
the
corners
of
the
overturned
table
the
corner
of
the
table
was
itself
stained
with
blood
a
tiny
stain
hardly
visible
but
it
told
me
that
on
rising
from
her
bed
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
fallen
heavily
and
had
struck
her
head
on
the
corner
of
its
marble
top
i
still
had
to
learn
in
addition
to
the
name
of
the
assassin
which
i
did
later
the
time
of
the
original
attack
i
learned
this
from
the
examination
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
her
father
though
the
answers
given
by
the
former
were
well
calculated
to
deceive
the
examining
magistrate
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
stated
very
minutely
how
she
had
spent
the
whole
of
her
time
that
day
we
established
the
fact
that
the
murderer
had
introduced
himself
into
the
pavilion
between
five
and
six
o
clock
at
a
quarter
past
six
the
professor
and
his
daughter
had
resumed
their
work
at
five
the
professor
had
been
with
his
daughter
and
since
the
attack
took
place
in
the
professor
s
absence
from
his
daughter
i
had
to
find
out
just
when
he
left
her
the
professor
had
stated
that
at
the
time
when
he
and
his
daughter
were
about
to
the
laboratory
he
was
met
by
the
keeper
and
held
in
conversation
about
the
cutting
of
some
wood
and
the
poachers
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
not
with
him
then
since
the
professor
said
i
left
the
keeper
and
rejoined
my
daughter
who
was
at
work
in
the
it
was
during
that
short
interval
of
time
that
the
tragedy
took
place
that
is
certain
in
my
mind
s
eye
i
saw
mademoiselle
stangerson
the
pavilion
go
to
her
room
to
take
off
her
hat
and
find
herself
faced
by
the
murderer
he
had
been
in
the
pavilion
for
some
time
waiting
for
her
he
had
arranged
to
pass
the
whole
night
there
he
had
taken
off
daddy
jacques
s
boots
he
had
removed
the
papers
from
the
cabinet
and
had
then
slipped
under
the
bed
finding
the
time
long
he
had
risen
gone
again
into
the
laboratory
then
into
the
vestibule
looked
into
the
garden
and
had
seen
coming
towards
the
pavilion
mademoiselle
stangerson
alone
he
would
never
have
dared
to
attack
her
at
that
hour
if
he
had
not
found
her
alone
his
mind
was
made
up
he
would
be
more
at
ease
alone
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
in
the
pavilion
than
he
would
have
been
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
daddy
jacques
sleeping
in
the
attic
so
he
shut
the
vestibule
window
that
explains
why
neither
monsieur
stangerson
nor
the
keeper
who
were
at
some
distance
from
the
pavilion
had
heard
the
revolver
shot
then
he
went
back
to
the
yellow
room
mademoiselle
stangerson
came
in
what
passed
must
have
taken
place
very
quickly
mademoiselle
tried
to
call
for
help
but
the
man
had
seized
her
by
the
throat
her
hand
had
sought
and
grasped
the
revolver
which
she
had
been
keeping
in
the
drawer
of
her
since
she
had
come
to
fear
the
threats
of
her
pursuer
the
murderer
was
about
to
strike
her
on
the
head
with
the
a
terrible
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
larsan
or
ballmeyer
but
she
fired
in
time
and
the
shot
wounded
the
hand
that
held
the
weapon
the
bone
fell
to
the
floor
covered
with
the
blood
of
the
murderer
who
staggered
clutched
at
the
wall
for
support
imprinting
on
it
the
red
marks
and
fearing
another
bullet
fled
she
saw
him
pass
through
the
laboratory
and
listened
he
was
long
at
the
window
at
length
he
jumped
from
it
she
flew
to
it
and
shut
it
the
danger
past
all
her
thoughts
were
of
her
father
had
he
either
seen
or
heard
at
any
cost
to
herself
she
must
keep
this
from
him
thus
when
monsieur
stangerson
returned
he
found
the
door
of
the
yellow
room
closed
and
his
daughter
in
the
laboratory
bending
over
her
desk
at
work
turning
towards
monsieur
darzac
rouletabille
cried
you
know
the
truth
tell
us
then
if
that
is
not
how
things
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
replied
monsieur
darzac
i
admire
you
for
your
silence
said
rouletabille
but
if
mademoiselle
stangerson
knew
of
your
danger
she
would
release
you
from
your
oath
she
would
beg
of
you
to
tell
all
she
has
confided
to
you
she
would
be
here
to
defend
you
monsieur
darzac
made
no
movement
nor
uttered
a
word
he
looked
at
rouletabille
sadly
however
said
the
young
reporter
since
mademoiselle
is
not
here
i
must
do
it
myself
but
believe
me
monsieur
darzac
the
only
means
to
save
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
restore
her
to
her
reason
is
to
secure
your
what
is
this
secret
motive
that
compels
mademoiselle
stangerson
to
hide
her
knowledge
from
her
father
asked
the
president
that
monsieur
i
do
not
know
said
rouletabille
it
is
no
business
of
the
president
turning
to
monsieur
darzac
endeavoured
to
induce
him
to
tell
what
he
knew
do
you
still
refuse
monsieur
to
tell
us
how
you
employeeed
your
time
during
the
attempts
on
the
life
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
can
not
tell
you
anything
the
president
turned
to
rouletabille
as
if
appealing
for
an
explanation
we
must
assume
monsieur
president
that
monsieur
robert
darzac
s
absences
are
closely
connected
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
secret
and
that
monsieur
darzac
feels
himself
in
honour
bound
to
remain
silent
it
may
be
that
larsan
who
since
his
three
attempts
has
had
everything
in
training
to
cast
suspicion
on
monsieur
darzac
had
fixed
on
just
those
occasions
for
a
meeting
with
monsieur
darzac
at
a
spot
most
compromising
larsan
is
cunning
enough
to
have
done
the
president
seemed
partly
convinced
but
still
curious
he
asked
but
what
is
this
secret
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
that
i
can
not
tell
you
said
rouletabille
i
think
however
you
know
enough
now
to
acquit
monsieur
robert
darzac
unless
larsan
should
return
and
i
don
t
think
he
will
he
added
with
a
laugh
one
question
more
said
the
president
admitting
your
explanation
we
know
that
larsan
wished
to
turn
suspicion
on
monsieur
robert
darzac
but
why
should
he
throw
suspicion
on
daddy
jacques
also
there
came
in
the
professional
detective
monsieur
who
proves
himself
an
unraveller
of
mysteries
by
annihilating
the
very
proofs
he
had
accumulated
he
s
a
very
cunning
man
and
a
similar
trick
had
often
enabled
him
to
turn
suspicion
from
himself
he
proved
the
innocence
of
one
before
accusing
the
other
you
can
easily
believe
monsieur
that
so
complicated
a
scheme
as
this
must
have
been
long
and
carefully
thought
out
in
advance
by
larsan
i
can
tell
you
that
he
had
long
been
engaged
on
its
elaboration
if
you
care
to
learn
how
he
had
gathered
information
you
will
find
that
he
had
on
one
occasion
disguised
himself
as
the
commissionaire
between
the
laboratory
of
the
surete
and
monsieur
stangerson
of
whom
experiments
were
demanded
in
this
way
he
had
been
able
before
the
crime
on
two
occasions
to
take
stock
of
the
pavilion
he
had
made
up
so
that
daddy
jacques
had
not
recognised
him
and
yet
larsan
had
found
the
opportunity
to
rob
the
old
man
of
a
pair
of
old
boots
and
a
basque
cap
which
the
servant
had
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
with
the
intention
of
carrying
them
to
a
friend
a
on
the
road
to
epinay
when
the
crime
was
discovered
daddy
jacques
had
immediately
recognised
these
objects
as
his
they
were
extremely
compromising
which
explains
his
distress
at
the
time
when
we
spoke
to
him
about
them
larsan
confessed
it
all
to
me
he
is
an
artist
at
the
game
he
did
a
similar
thing
in
the
affair
of
the
credit
universel
and
in
that
of
the
gold
ingots
of
the
both
these
cases
should
be
revised
since
ballmeyer
or
larsan
has
been
in
the
surete
a
number
of
innocent
persons
have
been
sent
to
chapter
xxviii
in
which
it
is
proved
that
one
does
not
always
think
of
everything
great
excitement
prevailed
when
rouletabille
had
finished
the
became
agitated
with
the
murmurings
of
suppressed
applause
maitre
henri
robert
called
for
an
adjournment
of
the
trial
and
was
supported
in
his
motion
by
the
public
prosecutor
himself
the
case
was
adjourned
the
next
day
monsieur
robert
darzac
was
released
on
bail
while
daddy
jacques
received
the
immediate
benefit
of
a
no
cause
for
search
was
everywhere
made
for
frederic
larsan
but
in
vain
monsieur
darzac
finally
escaped
the
awful
calamity
which
at
one
time
had
threatened
him
after
a
visit
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
was
led
to
hope
that
she
might
by
careful
nursing
one
day
recover
her
reason
rouletabille
naturally
became
the
man
of
the
on
leaving
the
palais
de
justice
the
crowd
bore
him
aloft
in
triumph
the
press
of
the
whole
world
published
his
exploits
and
his
photograph
he
who
had
interviewed
so
many
illustrious
personages
had
himself
become
illustrious
and
was
interviewed
in
his
turn
i
am
glad
to
say
that
the
enormous
success
in
no
way
turned
his
head
we
left
versailles
together
after
having
dined
at
the
dog
that
in
the
train
i
put
a
number
of
questions
to
him
which
during
our
meal
had
been
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
which
i
had
refrained
from
uttering
knowing
he
did
not
like
to
talk
shop
while
eating
my
friend
i
said
that
larsan
case
is
wonderful
it
is
worthy
of
he
begged
me
to
say
no
more
and
humorously
pretended
an
anxiety
for
me
should
i
give
way
to
silly
praise
of
him
because
of
a
personal
admiration
for
his
ability
i
ll
come
to
the
point
then
i
said
not
a
little
nettled
i
am
still
in
the
dark
as
to
your
reason
for
going
to
america
when
you
left
the
glandier
you
had
found
out
if
i
rightly
understand
all
about
frederic
larsan
you
had
discovered
the
exact
way
he
had
attempted
the
murder
quite
so
and
you
he
said
turning
the
conversation
did
you
suspect
nothing
nothing
it
s
incredible
i
don
t
see
how
i
could
have
suspected
anything
you
took
great
pains
to
conceal
your
thoughts
from
me
had
you
already
suspected
larsan
when
you
sent
for
me
to
bring
the
revolvers
yes
i
had
come
to
that
conclusion
through
the
incident
of
the
inexplicable
larsan
s
return
to
mademoiselle
stangerson
s
room
however
had
not
then
been
cleared
up
by
the
my
suspicions
were
the
outcome
of
my
reasoning
only
and
the
idea
of
larsan
being
the
murderer
seemed
so
extraordinary
that
i
resolved
to
wait
for
actual
evidence
before
venturing
to
act
nevertheless
the
suspicion
worried
me
and
i
sometimes
spoke
to
the
detective
in
a
way
that
ought
to
have
opened
your
eyes
i
spoke
disparagingly
of
his
methods
but
until
i
found
the
i
could
but
look
upon
my
suspicion
of
him
in
the
light
of
an
absurd
hypothesis
only
you
can
imagine
my
elation
after
i
had
explained
larsan
s
movements
i
remember
well
rushing
into
my
room
like
a
and
crying
to
you
i
ll
get
the
better
of
the
great
fred
i
ll
get
the
better
of
him
in
a
way
that
will
make
a
sensation
i
was
then
thinking
of
larsan
the
murderer
it
was
that
same
evening
that
darzac
begged
me
to
watch
over
mademoiselle
stangerson
i
made
no
efforts
until
after
we
had
dined
with
larsan
until
ten
o
clock
he
was
right
there
before
me
and
i
could
afford
to
wait
you
ought
to
have
suspected
because
when
we
were
talking
of
the
murderer
s
arrival
i
said
to
you
i
am
quite
sure
larsan
will
be
here
but
one
important
point
escaped
us
both
it
was
one
which
ought
to
have
opened
our
eyes
to
larsan
do
you
remember
the
bamboo
cane
i
was
surprised
to
find
larsan
had
made
no
use
of
that
evidence
against
robert
darzac
had
it
not
been
purchased
by
a
man
whose
description
tallied
exactly
with
that
of
darzac
well
just
before
i
saw
him
off
at
the
train
after
the
recess
during
the
trial
i
asked
him
why
he
hadn
t
used
the
cane
evidence
he
told
me
he
had
never
had
any
intention
of
doing
so
that
our
discovery
of
it
in
the
little
inn
at
epinay
had
much
embarrassed
him
if
you
will
remember
he
told
us
then
that
the
cane
had
been
given
him
in
london
why
did
we
not
immediately
say
to
ourselves
fred
is
lying
he
could
not
have
had
this
cane
in
london
he
was
not
in
london
he
bought
it
in
paris
then
you
found
out
on
inquiry
at
cassette
s
that
the
cane
had
been
bought
by
a
person
dressed
very
like
robert
darzac
though
as
we
learned
later
from
darzac
himself
it
was
not
he
who
had
made
the
purchase
couple
this
with
the
fact
we
already
knew
from
the
letter
at
the
poste
restante
that
there
was
actually
a
man
in
paris
who
was
passing
as
robert
darzac
why
did
we
not
immediately
fix
on
fred
himself
of
course
his
position
at
the
surete
was
against
us
but
when
we
saw
the
evident
eagerness
on
his
part
to
find
convicting
evidence
against
darzac
nay
even
the
passion
he
displayed
in
his
pursuit
of
the
man
the
lie
about
the
cane
should
have
had
a
new
meaning
for
us
if
you
ask
why
larsan
bought
the
cane
if
he
had
no
intention
of
manufacturing
evidence
against
darzac
by
means
of
it
the
answer
is
quite
simple
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
hand
by
mademoiselle
stangerson
so
that
the
cane
was
useful
to
enable
him
to
close
his
hand
in
carrying
it
you
remember
i
noticed
that
he
always
carried
it
all
these
details
came
back
to
my
mind
when
i
had
once
fixed
on
larsan
as
the
criminal
but
they
were
too
late
then
to
be
of
any
use
to
me
on
the
evening
when
he
pretended
to
be
drugged
i
looked
at
his
hand
and
saw
a
thin
silk
bandage
covering
the
signs
of
a
slight
healing
wound
had
we
taken
a
quicker
initiative
at
the
time
larsan
told
us
that
lie
about
the
cane
i
am
certain
he
would
have
gone
off
to
avoid
suspicion
all
the
same
we
worried
larsan
or
ballmeyer
without
our
knowing
but
i
interrupted
if
larsan
had
no
intention
of
using
the
cane
as
evidence
against
darzac
why
had
he
made
himself
up
to
look
like
the
man
when
he
went
in
to
buy
it
he
had
not
specially
made
up
as
darzac
to
buy
the
cane
he
had
come
straight
to
cassette
s
immediately
after
he
had
attacked
mademoiselle
stangerson
his
wound
was
troubling
him
and
as
he
was
passing
along
the
avenue
de
l
opera
the
idea
of
the
cane
came
to
his
mind
and
he
acted
on
it
it
was
then
eight
o
clock
and
i
who
had
hit
upon
the
very
hour
of
the
occurrence
of
the
tragedy
almost
convinced
that
darzac
was
not
the
criminal
and
knowing
of
the
cane
i
still
never
suspected
larsan
there
are
times
there
are
times
i
said
when
the
greatest
intellects
rouletabille
shut
my
mouth
i
still
continued
to
chide
him
but
finding
he
did
not
reply
i
saw
he
was
no
longer
paying
any
attention
to
what
i
was
saying
i
found
he
was
fast
asleep
chapter
xxix
the
mystery
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
during
the
days
that
followed
i
had
several
opportunities
to
question
him
as
to
his
reason
for
his
voyage
to
america
but
i
obtained
no
more
precise
answers
than
he
had
given
me
on
the
evening
of
the
adjournment
of
the
trial
when
we
were
on
the
train
for
paris
one
day
however
on
my
still
pressing
him
he
said
can
t
you
understand
that
i
had
to
know
larsan
s
true
personality
no
doubt
i
said
but
why
did
you
go
to
america
to
find
that
out
he
sat
smoking
his
pipe
and
made
no
further
reply
i
began
to
see
that
i
was
touching
on
the
secret
that
concerned
mademoiselle
stangerson
rouletabille
evidently
had
found
it
necessary
to
go
to
america
to
find
out
what
the
mysterious
tie
was
that
bound
her
to
larsan
by
so
strange
and
terrible
a
bond
in
america
he
had
learned
who
larsan
was
and
had
obtained
information
which
closed
his
mouth
he
had
been
to
philadelphia
and
now
what
was
this
mystery
which
held
mademoiselle
stangerson
and
monsieur
robert
darzac
in
so
inexplicable
a
silence
after
so
many
years
and
the
publicity
given
the
case
by
a
curious
and
shameless
press
now
that
monsieur
stangerson
knows
all
and
has
forgiven
all
all
may
be
told
in
every
phase
of
this
remarkable
story
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
always
been
the
sufferer
the
beginning
dates
from
the
time
when
as
a
young
girl
she
was
living
with
her
father
in
philadelphia
a
visitor
at
the
house
a
frenchman
had
succeeded
by
his
wit
grace
and
persistent
attention
in
gaining
her
affections
he
was
said
to
be
rich
and
had
asked
her
of
her
father
monsieur
stangerson
on
making
inquiries
as
to
monsieur
jean
roussel
found
that
the
man
was
a
swindler
and
an
adventurer
jean
roussel
was
but
another
of
the
many
names
under
which
the
notorious
ballmeyer
a
fugitive
from
france
tried
to
hide
himself
monsieur
stangerson
did
not
know
of
his
identity
with
ballmeyer
he
learned
that
the
man
was
simply
undesirable
for
his
daughter
he
not
only
refused
to
give
his
consent
to
the
marriage
but
denied
him
admission
into
the
house
mathilde
stangerson
however
had
fallen
in
love
to
her
jean
roussel
was
everything
that
her
love
painted
him
she
was
indignant
at
her
father
s
attitude
and
did
not
conceal
her
feelings
her
father
sent
her
to
stay
with
an
aunt
in
cincinnati
there
she
was
joined
by
jean
roussel
and
in
spite
of
the
reverence
she
felt
for
her
father
ran
away
with
him
to
get
married
they
went
to
louisville
and
lived
there
for
some
time
one
morning
however
a
knock
came
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
and
the
police
entered
to
arrest
jean
roussel
it
was
then
that
mathilde
stangerson
or
roussel
learned
that
her
husband
was
no
other
than
the
notorious
ballmeyer
the
young
woman
in
her
despair
tried
to
commit
suicide
she
failed
in
this
and
was
forced
to
rejoin
her
aunt
in
cincinnati
the
old
lady
was
overjoyed
to
see
her
again
she
had
been
anxiously
searching
for
her
and
had
not
dared
to
tell
monsieur
stangerson
of
her
disappearance
mathilde
swore
her
to
secrecy
so
that
her
father
should
not
know
she
had
been
away
a
month
later
mademoiselle
stangerson
returned
to
her
father
repentant
her
heart
dead
within
her
hoping
only
one
thing
that
she
would
never
again
see
her
husband
the
horrible
ballmeyer
a
report
was
spread
a
few
weeks
later
that
he
was
dead
and
she
now
determined
to
atone
for
her
disobedience
by
a
life
of
labour
and
devotion
for
her
father
and
she
kept
her
word
all
this
she
had
confessed
to
robert
darzac
and
believing
ballmeyer
dead
had
given
herself
to
the
joy
of
a
union
with
him
but
fate
had
resuscitated
jean
roussel
the
ballmeyer
of
her
youth
he
had
taken
steps
to
let
her
know
that
he
would
never
allow
her
to
marry
darzac
that
he
still
loved
her
mademoiselle
stangerson
never
for
one
moment
hesitated
to
confide
in
monsieur
darzac
she
showed
him
the
letter
in
which
jean
roussel
asked
her
to
recall
the
first
hours
of
their
union
in
their
beautiful
and
charming
louisville
home
the
presbytery
has
lost
nothing
of
its
charm
nor
the
garden
its
brightness
he
had
written
the
scoundrel
pretended
to
be
rich
and
claimed
the
right
of
taking
her
back
to
louisville
she
had
told
darzac
that
if
her
father
should
know
of
her
dishonour
she
would
kill
herself
monsieur
darzac
had
sworn
to
silence
her
persecutor
even
if
he
had
to
kill
him
he
was
outwitted
and
would
have
succumbed
had
it
not
been
for
the
genius
of
rouletabille
mademoiselle
stangerson
was
herself
helpless
in
the
hands
of
such
a
villain
she
had
tried
to
kill
him
when
he
had
first
threatened
and
then
attacked
her
in
the
yellow
room
she
had
unfortunately
failed
and
felt
herself
condemned
to
be
for
ever
at
the
mercy
of
this
unscrupulous
wretch
who
was
continually
demanding
her
presence
at
clandestine
interviews
when
he
sent
her
the
letter
through
the
post
office
asking
her
to
meet
him
she
had
refused
the
result
of
her
refusal
was
the
tragedy
of
the
yellow
room
the
second
time
he
wrote
asking
for
a
meeting
the
letter
reaching
her
in
her
sick
chamber
she
had
avoided
him
by
sleeping
with
her
servants
in
that
letter
the
scoundrel
had
warned
her
that
since
she
was
too
ill
to
come
to
him
he
would
come
to
her
and
that
he
would
be
in
her
chamber
at
a
particular
hour
on
a
particular
night
knowing
that
she
had
everything
to
fear
from
ballmeyer
she
had
left
her
chamber
on
that
night
it
was
then
that
the
incident
of
the
inexplicable
gallery
occurred
the
third
time
she
had
determined
to
keep
the
appointment
he
asked
for
it
in
the
letter
he
had
written
in
her
own
room
on
the
night
of
the
incident
in
the
gallery
which
he
left
on
her
desk
in
that
letter
he
threatened
to
burn
her
father
s
papers
if
she
did
not
meet
him
it
was
to
rescue
these
papers
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
see
him
she
did
not
for
one
moment
doubt
that
the
wretch
would
carry
out
his
threat
if
she
persisted
in
avoiding
him
and
in
that
case
the
labours
of
her
father
s
lifetime
would
be
for
ever
lost
since
the
meeting
was
thus
inevitable
she
resolved
to
see
her
husband
and
appeal
to
his
better
nature
it
was
for
this
interview
that
she
had
prepared
herself
on
the
night
the
keeper
was
killed
they
did
meet
and
what
passed
between
them
may
be
imagined
he
insisted
that
she
renounce
darzac
she
on
her
part
affirmed
her
love
for
him
he
stabbed
her
in
his
anger
determined
to
convict
darzac
of
the
crime
as
larsan
he
could
do
it
and
had
so
managed
things
that
darzac
could
never
explain
how
he
had
employeeed
the
time
of
his
absence
from
the
chateau
ballmeyer
s
precautions
were
most
cunningly
taken
larsan
had
threatened
darzac
as
he
had
threatened
mathilde
with
the
same
weapon
and
the
same
threats
he
wrote
darzac
urgent
letters
declaring
himself
ready
to
deliver
up
the
letters
that
had
passed
between
him
and
his
wife
and
to
leave
them
for
ever
if
he
would
pay
him
his
price
he
asked
darzac
to
meet
him
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
the
matter
appointing
the
time
when
larsan
would
be
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
when
darzac
went
to
epinay
expecting
to
find
ballmeyer
or
larsan
there
he
was
met
by
an
accomplice
of
larsan
s
and
kept
waiting
until
such
time
as
the
coincidence
could
be
established
it
was
all
done
with
machiavellian
cunning
but
ballmeyer
had
reckoned
without
joseph
rouletabille
now
that
the
mystery
of
the
yellow
room
has
been
cleared
up
this
is
not
the
time
to
tell
of
rouletabille
s
adventures
in
america
knowing
the
young
reporter
as
we
do
we
can
understand
with
what
acumen
he
had
traced
step
by
step
the
story
of
mathilde
stangerson
and
jean
roussel
at
philadelphia
he
had
quickly
informed
himself
as
to
arthur
william
rance
there
he
learned
of
rance
s
act
of
devotion
and
the
reward
he
thought
himself
entitled
to
for
it
a
rumour
of
his
marriage
with
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
once
found
its
way
into
the
of
philadelphia
he
also
learned
of
rance
s
continued
attentions
to
her
and
his
importunities
for
her
hand
he
had
taken
to
drink
he
had
said
to
drown
his
grief
at
his
unrequited
love
it
can
now
be
understood
why
rouletabille
had
shown
so
marked
a
coolness
of
demeanour
towards
rance
when
they
met
in
the
witnesses
room
on
the
day
of
the
trial
the
strange
mystery
had
now
been
laid
bare
who
was
this
jean
roussel
rouletabille
had
traced
him
from
philadelphia
to
cincinnati
in
cincinnati
he
became
acquainted
with
the
old
aunt
and
had
found
means
to
open
her
mouth
the
story
of
ballmeyer
s
arrest
threw
the
right
light
on
the
whole
story
he
visited
the
presbytery
a
small
and
pretty
dwelling
in
the
old
colonial
style
which
had
indeed
lost
nothing
of
its
then
abandoning
his
pursuit
of
traces
of
mademoiselle
stangerson
he
took
up
those
of
ballmeyer
he
followed
them
from
prison
to
prison
from
crime
to
crime
finally
as
he
was
about
leaving
for
europe
he
learned
in
new
york
that
ballmeyer
had
five
years
before
embarked
for
france
with
some
valuable
papers
belonging
to
a
merchant
of
new
orleans
whom
he
had
murdered
and
yet
the
whole
of
this
mystery
has
not
been
revealed
mademoiselle
stangerson
had
a
child
by
her
husband
a
son
the
infant
was
born
in
the
old
aunt
s
house
no
one
knew
of
it
so
well
had
the
aunt
managed
to
conceal
the
event
what
became
of
that
son
that
is
another
story
which
so
far
i
am
not
permitted
to
relate
about
two
months
after
these
events
i
came
upon
rouletabille
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
palais
de
justice
looking
very
depressed
what
s
the
matter
old
man
i
asked
you
are
looking
very
downcast
how
are
your
friends
getting
on
apart
from
you
he
said
i
have
no
i
hope
that
monsieur
darzac
no
and
mademoiselle
stangerson
how
is
she
better
much
then
you
ought
not
to
be
i
am
sad
he
said
because
i
am
thinking
of
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
the
perfume
of
the
lady
in
black
i
have
heard
you
often
refer
to
it
tell
me
why
it
troubles
perhaps
some
day
some
day
said
rouletabille
and
he
heaved
a
profound
sigh
