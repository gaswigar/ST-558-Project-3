took

chair
on
the
royal
taking

let
him
who
is
minded
to
meet
with
a
glug
pluck
three
hardy
hairs
from
a
rug
blow
one
to
the
south
and
one
to
the
west
then
burn
another
and
swallow
the
rest
and
who
shall
explain
is
the
talk
of
a
fool

a
glug
he
a
glug
of
the
old
gosh
school
and
he
climb
a
tree
if
the
east
wind
blows
in
a
casual
way

to

tickle

oh
tickle
his

follow

to
the
wobbly
bridge
turn
to
the
left
at
the
notice
board
climbing
the
over
the
ridge
soft
by
the
little
red
house
hold
your
breath
if
they
touch
the
latch
creep
to
the
still
as
a
mouse
then
run
like
mad
for
the
bracken
patch
worm
your
way
where
the
fern
fronds
tall
fashion
a
over
your
head
hemming
you
in
with
a
high
green
wall
then
when
the
thrush
calls
once
stop
dead
ask
of
the
old
grey
wallaby
there
him
by
the
woollybutt
tree
how
to
encounter
a
glug
and
where
the
country
of
gosh
famed
gosh
may
be
but
if
he
is
scornful
if
he
is
dumb
hush
there
another
way
left
then
come
on
a
white
still
night
where
the
dead
tree
bends
over
the
track
like
a
waiting
ghost
travel
the
winding
road
that
wends
down
to
the
shore
on
an
eastern
coast
follow
it
down
where
the
wake
of
the
moon
kisses
the
ripples
of
silver
sand
follow
it
on
where
the
night
seas
croon
a
traveller
tale
to
the
listening
land
step
not
jauntily
not
too
grave
till
the
lip
of
the
languorous
sea
you
greet
wait
till
the
wash
of
the
thirteenth
wave
tumbles
a
jellyfish
out
at
your
feet
not
too
hopefully
not
forlorn
whisper
a
word
of
your
earnest
quest
shed
not
a
tear
if
he
turns
in
scorn
and
sneers
in
your
face
like
a
fish
possessed
hist
hope
on
there
is
yet
a
way
brooding
jellyfish
wo
be
gay
wait
till
the
clock
in
the
tower
booms
three
and
the
big
bank
opposite
gnashes
its
doors
then
glide
with
a
gait
that
is
carefully
free
by
the
great
brick
building
of
seventeen
floors
haste
by
the
draper
who
smirks
at
his
door
straining
to
lure
you
with
sinister
force
turn
up
the
lane
by
the
store
and
halt
by
the
light
bay
carrier
horse
by
the
carrier
horse
with
the
long
sad
face
and
the
wisdom
of
years
in
his
mournful
eye
bow
to
him
thrice
with
a
courtier
grace
proffer
your
query
and
pause
for
reply
eagerly
ask
for
a
hint
of
the
glug
pause
for
reply
with
your
hat
in
your
hand
if
he
responds
with
a
snort
and
a
shrug
strive
to
interpret
and
understand
rare
will
a
carrier
horse
condescend
yet
there
another
way
on
to
the
end
catch
the
your
ticket
in
hand
punched
by
the
porter
who
broods
in
his
box
journey
afar
to
the
sad
soggy
land
wearing
your
lavender
socks
wait
at
the
creek
by
the
log
till
the
blood
of
a
slain
day
reddens
the
west
hark
for
the
croak
of
a
gentleman
frog
of
a
corpulent
frog
with
a
white
satin
vest
go
as
he
guides
you
over
the
marsh
treading
with
care
on
the
slithery
stones
heedless
of
night
winds
moaning
and
harsh
that
seize
you
and
freeze
you
and
search
for
your
bones
on
to
the
edge
of
a
still
dark
pool
banishing
thoughts
of
your
warm
wool
rug
gaze
in
the
depths
of
it
placid
and
cool
and
long
in
your
heart
for
one
glimpse
of
a
glug
krock
was
he
mocking
you
krock
well
you
bought
a
return
and
it
past
ten
choose
you
a
night
when
the
intimate
stars
carelessly
prattle
of
cosmic
affairs
flat
on
your
back
with
your
nose
pointing
mars
search
for
the
star
who
fled
south
from
the
bears
gaze
for
an
hour
at
that
little
blue
star
giving
him
cheerfully
wink
for
his
wink
shrink
to
the
size
of
the
being
you
are
sneeze
if
you
have
to
but
softly
then
think
throw
wide
the
portals
and
let
your
thoughts
run
over
the
earth
like
a
galloping
herd
bounds
to
profundity
let
there
be
none
let
there
be
nothing
too
madly
absurd
ponder
on
pebbles
or
stock
exchange
shares
on
the
mission
of
man
or
the
life
of
a
bug
on
planets
or
billiards
policemen
or
bears
alert
all
the
time
for
the
sight
of
a
glug
meditate
deeply
on
softgoods
or
sex
on
carraway
seeds
or
the
causes
of
bills
biology
art
or
mysterious
wrecks
or
the
tattered
white
fleeces
of
clouds
on
blue
hills
muse
upon
ologies
freckles
and
fog
why
hermits
live
lonely
and
grapes
in
a
bunch
on
the
ways
of
a
child
or
the
mind
of
a
dog
or
the
oyster
you
bolted
last
friday
at
lunch
heard
you
no
sound
like
a
shuddering
sigh
or
the
great
shout
of
laughter
that
swept
down
the
sky
saw
you
no
sign
on
the
wide
milky
way
then
there
naught
left
to
you
now
but
to
pray
sit
you
at
eve
when
the
shepherd
in
blue
calls
from
the
west
to
his
clustering
sheep
then
pray
for
the
moods
that
old
mariners
woo
for
the
thoughts
of
young
mothers
who
watch
their
babes
sleep
pray
for
the
heart
of
an
innocent
child
for
the
tolerant
scorn
of
a
weary
old
man
for
the
petulant
grief
of
a
prophet
reviled
for
the
wisdom
you
lost
when
your
whiskers
began
pray
for
the
pleasures
that
he
who
was
you
found
in
the
mud
of
a
pool
for
the
fears
that
he
felt
and
the
joys
that
he
knew
when
a
little
green
lizard
crept
into
the
school
pray
as
they
pray
who
are
maddened
by
wine
for
distraction
from
self
and
a
spirit
at
rest
now
deep
in
the
heart
of
you
search
for
a
sign
if
there
be
naught
of
it
vain
is
your
quest
lay
down
the
book
for
to
follow
the
tale
were
to
trade
in
false
blame
as
all
mortals
who
fail
and
may
the
gods
salve
you
on
life
dreary
round
for
is
whispered
who
finds
not
is
he
shall
be
found
ii
joi
the
glug
the
glugs
abide
in
a
far
far
land
that
is
partly
pebbles
and
stones
and
sand
but
mainly
earth
of
a
chocolate
hue
when
it
is
purple
or
slightly
blue
and
the
glugs
live
there
with
their
aunts
and
their
wives
in
tenements
all
their
lives
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
weather
is
wet
to
see
how
high
they
can
really
get
pray
do
forget
this
is
chiefly
done
when
the
weather
is
wet
and
every
shadow
that
flits
and
hides
and
every
stream
that
glistens
and
glides
and
laughs
its
way
from
a
highland
height
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
and
they
say
our
test
is
the
best
by
far
for
a
glug
is
a
glug
so
there
you
are
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
it
drizzles
or
hails
to
get
electricity
into
their
nails
and
the
glug
that
fails
is
a
luckless
glug
if
it
drizzles
or
hails
now
the
glugs
abide
in
the
lands
of
gosh
and
they
work
all
day
for
the
sake
of
splosh
for
splosh
the
first
is
the
nation
pride
and
king
of
the
glugs
on
his
uncle
side
and
they
sleep
at
night
for
the
sake
of
rest
for
their
doctors
say
this
suits
them
best
and
they
climb
the
trees
as
a
general
rule
for
exercise
when
the
weather
is
cool
they
taught
at
school
to
climb
the
trees
when
the
weather
is
cool
and
the
whispering
grass
on
the
gay
green
hills
and
every
cricket
that
skirls
and
shrills
and
every
moonbeam
gleaming
white
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
and
they
say
it
is
safe
it
is
the
test
we
bring
for
a
glug
is
an
awful
gluglike
thing
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
there
a
sign
of
fog
to
scan
the
land
for
a
feasible
dog
they
love
to
jog
thro
dells
in
quest
of
a
feasible
dog
the
glugs
eat
meals
three
times
a
day
because
their
fathers
ate
that
way
their
grandpas
said
the
scheme
was
good
to
help
the
glugs
digest
their
food
and
is
wholesome
food
the
glugs
have
got
for
it
says
so
plain
on
the
tin
and
pot
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
weather
is
dry
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
pale
green
sky
we
do
know
why
but
they
like
to
gaze
on
the
pale
green
sky
and
every
cloud
that
sails
aloft
and
every
breeze
that
blows
so
soft
and
every
star
that
shines
at
night
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
for
they
say
our
test
it
is
safe
and
true
what
one
glug
does
the
other
glugs
do
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
weather
is
hot
for
a
view
of
the
garden
plot
of
course
it
rot
but
they
love
that
view
of
the
garden
plot
at
two
on
a
wednesday
morn
a
most
peculiar
glug
was
born
and
later
on
when
he
grew
a
man
he
scoffed
and
sneered
at
the
chosen
plan
it
wrong
said
this
glug
whose
name
was
joi
bah
said
the
glugs
he
a
crazy
boy
and
they
climbed
the
trees
as
the
west
wind
stirred
to
hark
to
the
note
of
the
guffer
bird
it
seems
absurd
but
they
foolishly
fond
of
the
guffer
bird
and
every
reed
that
rustles
and
sways
by
the
gurgling
river
that
plashes
and
plays
and
the
beasts
of
the
dread
neurotic
night
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
and
why
say
they
it
is
easily
done
for
a
dexter
glug
like
a
sinister
one
and
they
climb
the
trees
oh
they
climb
the
trees
and
they
bark
their
knuckles
and
chafe
their
knees
and
is
one
of
the
world
great
mysteries
that
things
like
these
get
into
the
serious
histories
iii
the
stones
of
gosh
now
here
is
a
tale
of
the
glugs
of
gosh
and
a
wonderful
tale
i
ween
of
the
glugs
of
gosh
and
their
great
king
splosh
and
tush
his
virtuous
queen
and
here
is
a
tale
of
the
crafty
ogs
in
their
neighbouring
land
of
podge
of
their
sayings
and
doings
and
plottings
and
brewings
and
something
about
sir
stodge
wise
to
profundity
stout
to
rotundity
that
was
the
knight
sir
stodge
oh
the
king
was
rich
and
the
queen
was
fair
and
they
made
a
very
respectable
pair
and
whenever
a
glug
in
that
peaceful
land
did
anything
no
one
could
understand
the
knight
sir
stodge
he
looked
in
a
book
and
charged
that
glug
with
a
crime
called
crook
and
the
great
judge
fudge
who
wore
for
a
hat
the
sacred
skin
of
a
tortoiseshell
cat
he
fined
that
glug
for
his
action
rash
and
frequently
asked
a
deposit
in
cash
then
every
glug
he
went
home
to
his
rest
with
his
head
in
a
bag
and
his
toes
to
the
west
for
they
knew
it
was
best
since
their
grandpas
slept
with
their
toes
to
the
west
but
all
of
the
tale
that
is
so
far
told
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
ogs
of
podge
and
their
crafty
dodge
and
the
trade
in
pickles
and
glue
to
trade
with
the
glugs
came
the
ogs
to
gosh
and
they
said
in
seductive
tones
we
sell
you
pianers
and
pickels
and
spanners
for
seventeen
shiploads
of
stones
smooth
or
nobbly
firm
or
wobbly
all
we
ask
is
stones
and
the
king
said
what
and
the
queen
said
why
that
is
awfully
cheap
to
the
things
i
buy
for
that
grocer
of
ours
in
the
light
brown
hat
asks
two
and
eleven
for
pickles
like
that
but
a
glug
stood
up
with
a
wart
on
his
nose
and
cried
your
majesties
ogs
is
foes
but
the
glugs
cried
peace
will
you
hold
your
jaw
how
did
our
grandpas
fashion
the
law
said
the
knight
sir
stodge
as
he
opened
his
book
when
the
goods
were
cheap
then
the
goods
we
took
so
they
fined
the
glug
with
the
wart
on
his
nose
for
wearing
a
wart
with
his
everyday
clothes
and
the
goods
were
brought
home
thro
a
glug
named
ghones
and
the
ogs
went
home
with
their
loads
of
stones
which
they
landed
with
glee
in
the
land
of
podge
do
you
notice
the
dodge
not
yet
did
the
glugs
nor
the
knight
sir
stodge
in
the
following
summer
the
ogs
came
back
with
a
cargo
of
clocks
and
screens
and
sewing
machines
and
mangles
and
scissors
and
socks
and
they
said
for
these
excellent
things
we
bring
we
are
ready
to
take
more
stones
and
in
bricks
or
for
goods
you
will
settle
indented
by
your
mister
ghones
cried
the
glugs
praisingly
why
how
amazingly
smart
of
industrious
ghones
and
the
king
said
hum
and
the
queen
said
oo
that
curtain
what
a
blue
but
a
glug
stood
up
with
some
very
large
ears
and
said
there
is
more
in
this
thing
than
appears
and
we
ought
to
be
taxing
those
goods
of
the
ogs
or
our
industries
soon
will
be
gone
to
the
dogs
and
the
king
said
bosh
you
and
rude
and
the
queen
said
what
an
absurd
attitude
then
the
glugs
cried
down
with
political
quacks
how
did
our
grandpas
look
at
a
tax
so
the
knight
sir
stodge
he
opened
his
book
no
tax
said
he
wherever
i
look
then
they
fined
the
glug
with
the
prominent
ears
for
being
by
several
years
and
the
ogs
went
home
with
the
stones
did
you
notice
the
scheme
nor
yet
did
the
glugs
in
their
dreamiest
dreams
then
every
month
to
the
land
of
the
gosh
the
ogs
they
continued
to
come
with
buttons
and
hooks
and
medical
books
and
rotary
engines
and
rum
large
cases
with
labels
occasional
tables
hair
tonic
and
fiddles
and
and
the
glugs
while
copncealing
their
joy
in
the
dealing
paid
promptly
in
nothing
but
stones
why
it
was
screamingly
laughable
seemingly
asking
for
nothing
but
stones
and
the
king
said
haw
and
the
queen
said
oh
our
now
is
a
heavenly
show
of
large
overmantels
and
whatnots
and
chairs
and
a
statue
of
splosh
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
a
glug
stood
up
with
a
cast
in
his
eye
and
he
said
far
too
many
baubles
we
buy
with
all
the
gosh
factories
closing
their
doors
and
importers
warehouses
lining
our
shores
but
the
glugs
cried
down
with
such
meddlesome
fools
what
did
our
grandpas
lay
down
in
their
rules
and
the
knight
sir
stodge
he
opened
his
book
to
cheapness
he
said
was
the
road
they
took
then
every
glug
who
was
not
too
fat
turned
seventeen
handsprings
and
jumped
on
his
hat
they
fined
the
glug
with
the
cast
in
his
eye
for
looking
both
ways
which
he
did
not
deny
and
for
having
no
visible
precedent
which
is
a
crime
in
the
poor
and
a
fault
in
the
rich
so
the
glugs
continued
with
greed
and
glee
to
buy
cheap
clothing
and
pills
and
tea
till
every
glug
in
the
land
of
gosh
owned
three
clean
shirts
and
a
fourth
in
the
wash
but
they
all
grew
idle
and
fond
of
ease
and
easy
to
swindle
and
hard
to
please
and
the
voice
of
joi
was
a
lonely
voice
when
he
railed
at
gosh
for
its
foolish
choice
but
the
great
king
grinned
and
the
good
queen
gushed
as
the
goods
of
the
ogs
were
madly
rushed
and
the
knight
sir
stodge
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
declared
it
a
happy
and
prosperous
land
iv
sym
the
son
of
joi
now
joi
the
rebel
he
had
a
son
in
far
far
gosh
where
the
tall
trees
wave
said
joi
in
gosh
there
shall
yet
be
one
to
scorn
this
life
of
a
slave
to
spurn
the
law
of
the
knight
sir
stodge
and
end
the
rule
of
the
great
king
splosh
who
shall
warn
the
glugs
of
their
crafty
dodge
and
at
last
bring
peace
sweet
peace
to
gosh
said
he
whenever
the
kind
sun
showers
his
golden
treasure
on
grateful
flowers
with
upturned
faces
and
hearts
bowed
low
the
glugs
shall
know
what
the
wild
things
know
said
he
wherever
the
broad
fields
smile
they
shall
walk
with
clean
minds
free
of
guile
they
shall
scoff
aloud
at
the
call
of
greed
and
turn
to
their
labours
and
never
heed
so
joi
had
a
son
and
his
name
was
sym
and
his
eyes
were
wide
as
the
eyes
of
truth
and
there
came
to
the
wondering
mind
of
him
long
thoughts
of
the
riddle
that
vexes
youth
and
father
he
said
in
the
mart
loud
din
is
there
aught
of
pleasure
do
some
find
joy
but
his
father
tilted
the
beardless
chin
and
looked
in
the
eyes
of
the
questing
boy
said
he
whenever
the
fields
are
green
lie
still
where
the
wild
rose
fashions
a
screen
while
the
brown
thrush
calls
to
his
mate
and
know
what
they
profit
who
trade
with
hate
said
he
whenever
the
great
skies
spread
in
the
beckoning
vastness
overhead
a
tent
for
the
blue
wren
building
a
nest
then
down
in
the
heart
of
you
learn
what
best
and
there
came
to
sym
as
he
walked
afield
deep
thoughts
of
the
world
and
the
folk
of
gosh
he
saw
the
idols
to
which
they
kneeled
he
marked
them
cringe
to
the
name
of
splosli
is
it
meet
he
asked
that
a
soul
should
crawl
to
a
purple
robe
or
a
gilded
chair
but
his
father
walked
to
the
garden
wall
and
stooped
to
a
flowering
there
said
he
whenever
a
bursting
bloom
looks
up
to
the
sun
may
a
soul
find
room
for
a
measure
of
awe
at
the
wondrous
birth
of
one
more
treasure
to
this
glad
earth
said
he
whenever
a
dewdrop
clings
to
a
gossamer
thread
and
glitters
and
swings
deep
in
humility
bow
your
head
to
a
thing
for
a
blundering
rnortal
dread
and
there
came
to
sym
in
his
later
youth
with
the
first
clear
glance
in
the
face
of
guile
thirst
for
knowledge
and
thoughts
of
truth
of
gilded
baubles
and
things
worth
while
and
he
said
there
is
much
that
a
glug
should
know
but
his
mind
is
clouded
his
years
are
few
then
joi
the
father
he
answered
low
as
his
thoughts
ran
back
to
the
youth
he
knew
said
he
whenever
the
west
wind
stirs
and
birds
in
feathers
and
beasts
in
furs
steal
out
to
dance
in
the
glade
lie
still
let
your
heart
teach
you
what
it
will
said
he
whenever
the
moonlight
creeps
thro
inlaced
boughs
a
shy
star
peeps
adown
from
its
crib
in
the
cradling
sky
know
of
their
folly
who
fear
to
die
new
interest
came
to
the
mind
of
sym
as
his
fellows
he
lived
and
toiled
but
the
ways
of
the
glug
folk
puzzled
him
for
some
won
honour
while
some
were
foiled
yet
all
were
filled
with
a
vague
unrest
as
they
climbed
their
trees
in
an
endless
search
but
joi
the
father
he
mocked
their
quest
when
he
marked
a
glug
on
his
perch
said
he
whenever
these
tales
are
heard
of
the
feasible
dog
or
the
guffer
bird
then
laugh
and
laugh
till
the
fat
tears
roll
to
the
roots
of
the
deep
in
your
soul
when
you
see
them
squat
on
the
high
scanning
for
ever
that
heedless
sky
lie
flat
on
your
back
on
the
good
green
earth
and
roar
till
the
great
vault
echoes
your
mirth
as
he
walked
in
the
city
to
sym
there
came
sounds
envenomed
with
fear
and
hate
shouts
of
anger
and
words
of
shame
as
glug
blamed
glug
for
his
woeful
state
this
blame
said
sym
is
it
mortal
right
to
blame
his
fellow
for
aught
he
be
but
the
father
said
do
we
blame
the
night
when
darkness
gathers
and
none
can
see
said
he
whenever
there
springs
from
earth
a
plant
all
crooked
and
marred
at
birth
shall
we
unlearned
in
the
gardener
scheme
blame
plant
or
earth
for
the
faults
that
seem
said
he
whenever
your
wondering
eyes
look
out
on
the
glory
of
earth
and
skies
shall
you
the
blessing
of
fields
fling
blame
at
the
blind
man
prisoned
in
gloom
so
joi
had
a
son
and
his
name
was
sym
far
from
the
ken
of
the
great
king
splosh
and
small
was
the
glugs
regard
of
him
mooning
along
in
the
streets
of
gosh
but
many
a
creature
by
field
and
ford
shared
in
the
schooling
of
that
strange
boy
dreaming
and
planning
to
gather
and
hoard
knowledge
of
all
things
precious
to
joi
the
growth
of
sym
now
sym
was
a
glug
and
is
mentioned
so
that
the
tale
reads
perfectly
plain
as
we
go
in
his
veins
ran
blood
of
that
stupid
race
of
docile
folk
who
inhabit
the
place
called
gosh
sad
gosh
where
the
tall
trees
sigh
with
a
strange
significant
sort
of
cry
when
the
gloaming
creeps
and
the
wind
is
high
when
the
deep
shades
creep
and
the
wind
is
high
the
trees
bow
low
as
the
gods
ride
by
gods
of
the
gloaming
who
ride
on
the
breeze
stooping
to
heaften
the
birds
and
the
trees
but
each
dull
glug
sits
down
by
his
door
and
mutters
is
windy
and
nothing
more
like
the
glugs
in
the
days
of
yore
when
sym
was
born
there
was
much
and
his
parents
thought
him
a
joy
to
view
but
folk
not
prejudiced
saw
the
glug
as
his
nurse
remarked
in
the
cut
of
his
mug
for
he
had
their
hair
and
he
had
their
eyes
and
the
glug
expression
of
pained
surprise
and
their
predilection
for
pumpkin
pies
and
his
parents
claims
were
a
deal
denied
by
his
maiden
aunt
on
his
mother
side
a
tall
glug
lady
of
with
a
slight
moustache
of
an
auburn
hue
parental
blither
she
said
quite
flat
he
an
average
glug
and
he
red
and
fat
and
exceedingly
fat
and
red
at
that
but
the
father
joi
when
he
gazed
on
sym
dreamed
great
and
wonderful
things
for
him
said
he
if
the
mind
of
a
glug
could
wake
then
oh
what
a
wonderful
glug
he
make
we
shall
teach
this
laddie
to
play
life
game
with
a
different
mind
and
a
definite
aim
a
glug
in
appearance
yet
not
the
same
but
the
practical
aunt
said
fudge
you
fool
we
pack
up
his
dinner
and
send
him
to
school
he
shall
learn
about
and
parsing
and
capes
and
how
to
make
money
with
inches
on
tapes
we
apprentice
him
then
to
the
drapery
trade
where
i
heard
it
reported
large
profits
are
made
besides
he
can
sell
us
cheap
buttons
and
braid
so
poor
young
sym
he
was
sent
to
school
where
the
first
thing
taught
is
the
golden
rule
do
unto
others
the
teacher
said
then
suddenly
stopped
and
scratched
his
head
you
may
look
up
the
rest
in
a
book
said
he
at
present
it
does
occur
to
me
but
do
it
whatever
it
happens
to
be
and
now
said
the
teacher
the
day
task
brings
consideration
of
practical
things
if
a
man
makes
a
profit
of
fifteen
pounds
on
one
week
takings
from
two
milk
rounds
how
many
and
sym
went
dreaming
away
to
the
sunlit
lands
where
the
play
and
wrens
hold
revel
the
livelong
day
he
walked
in
the
welcoming
fields
alone
while
from
far
far
away
came
the
pedagogue
drone
if
a
man
makes
abstract
nouns
from
b
take
of
towns
rods
poles
or
perches
derived
from
greek
oh
the
hawthorn
buds
came
out
this
week
and
robins
are
nesting
down
by
the
creek
so
sym
was
head
of
his
class
not
once
and
his
aunt
repeatedly
dubbed
him
dunce
but
give
him
a
chance
said
his
father
joi
his
head
is
abnormally
large
for
a
boy
but
his
aunt
said
piffie
it
crammed
with
bosh
why
he
do
know
the
rivers
and
mountains
of
gosh
nor
the
names
of
the
nephews
of
good
king
splosh
in
gosh
when
a
youth
gets
an
obstinate
look
and
copies
his
into
a
book
and
blackens
his
and
frowns
at
a
joke
ah
he
getting
sense
say
the
elderly
folk
but
sym
he
would
laugh
when
he
ought
to
be
sad
said
his
aunt
what
wrong
with
the
lad
he
romps
with
the
puppies
and
talks
to
the
ants
and
keeps
his
loose
change
in
his
pants
and
stumbles
all
over
my
cauliflower
plants
there
is
wisdom
in
that
laughed
the
father
joi
but
the
aunt
said
toity
and
drat
the
boy
he
shall
play
said
the
father
some
noble
part
who
knows
but
it
may
be
in
letters
or
art
is
a
dignified
business
to
make
folk
think
but
the
aunt
cried
what
go
messing
with
ink
and
smear
all
his
fingers
and
take
to
drink
paint
hussies
and
cows
and
end
in
the
clink
so
the
argument
ran
but
one
bright
spring
day
sym
settled
it
all
in
his
own
strange
way
is
a
tramp
he
announced
i
decided
to
be
and
i
start
next
monday
at
twenty
to
three
when
the
aunt
recovered
she
screamed
a
tramp
a
pilfering
idle
scamp
who
steals
people
washing
and
sleeps
in
the
damp
sharp
to
the
hour
sym
was
ready
and
dressed
young
birds
sighed
the
father
must
go
from
the
nest
when
the
green
moss
covers
those
stones
you
tread
when
the
green
grass
whispers
above
my
head
mark
well
wherever
your
path
may
turn
they
have
reached
the
valley
of
peace
who
learn
that
wise
hearts
cherish
what
fools
may
spurn
so
sym
went
off
and
a
year
ran
by
and
the
father
said
with
a
sigh
it
is
meet
that
the
young
should
leave
the
nest
said
the
aunt
do
spill
that
soup
on
your
vest
nor
mention
his
name
he
our
one
disgrace
and
he
probably
sneaking
around
some
place
with
fuzzy
black
whiskers
all
over
his
face
but
under
a
hedge
by
a
flowering
peach
a
youth
with
a
little
blue
wren
held
speech
with
his
back
to
a
tree
and
his
feet
in
the
grass
he
watched
the
drift
and
pass
and
the
borne
on
a
lazy
breeze
move
by
on
their
errand
above
the
trees
into
the
vault
of
the
mysteries
now
teach
me
little
blue
wren
said
he
is
you
can
unravel
this
riddle
for
me
i
am
by
the
gifts
of
this
kindly
earth
which
of
them
all
has
the
greatest
worth
he
flirted
his
tail
as
he
answered
then
he
bobbed
and
he
bowed
to
his
coy
little
hen
why
sunlight
and
worms
said
the
little
blue
wren
vi
the
end
of
joi
they
climbed
the
trees
as
was
told
before
the
glugs
climbed
trees
in
the
days
of
yore
when
the
oldes
tree
in
the
land
was
a
tender
little
seedling
nay
this
climbing
habit
was
old
so
old
that
even
the
cheeses
could
not
have
told
when
the
past
glug
people
first
began
to
give
their
lives
to
the
climbing
plan
and
the
legend
ran
that
the
art
was
old
as
the
mind
of
man
and
even
the
mountains
old
and
hoar
and
the
billows
that
broke
on
gosh
shore
since
the
neolithic
night
all
knew
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
and
they
tell
of
a
perfectly
easy
way
for
yesterday
glug
is
the
glug
of
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
thunder
rolls
to
solemnly
salve
their
souls
for
they
fear
the
coals
that
threaten
to
frizzle
their
souls
they
climbed
the
trees
is
a
bootless
task
to
say
so
over
again
or
ask
the
cause
of
it
all
or
the
reason
why
they
never
felt
happier
up
on
high
for
joi
asked
why
and
joi
was
a
fool
and
never
a
glug
of
the
fine
old
school
with
fixed
opinions
and
sunday
clothes
and
the
habit
of
looking
beyond
its
nose
and
treating
foes
with
the
calm
contempt
of
the
one
who
knows
and
every
spider
who
heaves
a
line
and
trusts
to
his
luck
when
the
day
is
fine
or
reckless
swings
from
an
awful
height
he
knows
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
you
can
never
mistake
them
he
will
say
for
they
always
act
in
a
gluglike
way
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
glass
points
fair
with
circumspection
and
proper
care
for
they
fear
to
tear
the
very
expensive
clothes
they
wear
but
joi
was
a
glug
with
a
twisted
mind
of
the
nasty
meditative
kind
he
meditate
on
the
modes
of
gosh
and
dared
to
muse
on
the
acts
of
splosh
he
dared
to
speak
and
worse
than
that
he
spoke
out
loud
and
he
said
it
flat
why
climb
said
he
when
you
reach
the
top
there
nowhere
to
go
and
you
have
to
stop
unless
you
drop
and
the
higher
you
are
the
worse
you
flop
and
every
cricket
that
chirps
at
eve
and
scoffs
at
the
folly
of
fools
who
grieve
and
the
furtive
mice
who
revel
at
night
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
for
why
they
say
in
the
land
of
gosh
there
is
no
one
else
who
will
bow
to
splosh
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
the
rain
pelts
down
and
feeds
the
gutters
that
thread
the
town
for
they
fear
to
drown
when
floods
are
frothy
and
waters
brown
said
the
glug
called
joi
this
climbing
trees
is
a
foolish
art
and
things
like
these
cause
much
distress
in
the
land
of
gosh
let
stay
on
the
ground
and
kill
king
splosh
but
splosh
the
king
he
smiled
a
smile
and
beckoned
once
to
his
hangman
guile
who
climbed
a
tree
when
the
weather
was
calm
and
they
hanged
poor
joi
on
a
snufflebust
palm
then
they
sang
a
psalm
did
those
pious
glugs
the
snufflebust
palm
and
every
bee
that
kisses
a
and
every
blossom
born
for
an
hour
and
every
bird
on
its
gladsome
flight
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
for
they
say
is
a
simple
test
we
got
if
you
know
one
glug
why
you
know
the
lot
so
they
climbed
a
tree
in
the
bourgeoning
spring
and
they
hanged
poor
joi
with
some
string
is
a
horrible
thing
to
be
hanged
by
glugs
with
string
then
splosh
the
king
rose
up
and
said
it
not
polite
but
he
safer
dead
and
there
not
much
room
in
the
land
of
gosh
for
a
glug
named
joi
and
a
king
called
splosh
and
every
glug
flung
high
his
hat
and
cried
we
glugs
and
you
ca
change
that
so
they
climbed
the
trees
since
the
weather
was
cold
while
the
brazen
bell
of
the
city
tolled
and
tolled
and
told
the
fate
of
a
glug
who
was
and
every
cloud
that
sails
the
blue
and
every
dancing
sunbeam
too
and
every
sparkling
dewdrop
bright
all
know
the
glugs
quite
well
by
sight
we
tell
say
they
by
a
simple
test
for
any
old
glug
is
like
the
rest
and
they
climb
the
trees
when
there
weather
about
in
a
general
way
as
a
cure
for
gout
tho
some
folks
doubt
if
the
climbing
habit
is
good
for
gout
so
joi
was
hanged
and
his
race
was
run
and
the
glugs
were
tickled
with
what
they
done
and
after
that
if
a
day
should
come
when
a
glug
felt
extra
specially
glum
he
call
his
children
around
his
knee
and
tell
that
tale
with
a
chuckle
of
glee
and
should
a
little
glug
girl
or
boy
see
naught
of
a
joke
in
the
fate
of
joi
then
he
employ
stern
measures
with
such
little
girl
or
boy
but
every
dawn
that
paints
the
sky
and
every
splendid
noontide
high
all
know
the
glugs
so
well
so
well
is
an
easy
matter
and
plain
to
tell
for
lacking
wit
with
a
candour
smug
a
glug
will
boast
that
he
is
a
glug
and
they
climb
the
trees
if
it
shines
or
rains
to
settle
the
squirming
in
their
brains
and
the
darting
pains
that
are
caused
by
rushing
and
catching
trains
vii
the
swanks
of
gosh
come
mourn
with
me
for
the
land
of
gosh
oh
weep
with
me
for
the
luckless
glugs
of
the
land
of
gosh
where
the
sad
seas
wash
the
patient
shores
and
the
great
king
splosh
his
sodden
sorrow
hugs
where
the
fair
queen
tush
weeps
all
the
day
and
the
swank
the
swank
the
naughty
swank
the
haughty
swank
holds
sway
the
most
mendacious
ostentatious
spacious
swank
holds
sway
is
as
i
know
full
well
and
garbed
in
gloom
and
the
weeds
of
woe
and
vague
so
far
is
the
tale
i
tell
but
bear
with
me
for
the
briefest
spell
and
surely
shall
ye
know
of
the
land
of
gosh
and
tush
and
splosh
and
stodge
the
swank
the
foolish
swank
the
mulish
swank
of
the
meretricious
avaricious
vicious
swank
of
gosh
oh
the
tall
trees
bend
and
green
trees
send
a
chuckle
round
the
earth
and
the
soft
winds
croon
a
jeering
tune
and
the
harsh
winds
shriek
with
mirth
and
the
wee
small
birds
chirp
ribald
words
when
the
swank
walks
down
the
street
but
every
glug
takes
off
his
hat
and
whispers
humbly
look
at
that
hats
off
hats
off
to
the
glug
of
rank
sir
stodge
the
swank
the
lord
high
swank
then
the
east
wind
roars
a
loud
guffaw
and
the
haughty
swank
says
haw
his
brain
is
dull
and
his
mind
is
dense
and
his
lack
of
saving
wit
complete
but
most
amazingly
immense
is
his
inane
and
his
innate
conceit
but
every
glug
and
great
king
splosh
bowed
to
sir
stodge
the
fuddled
swank
the
muddled
swank
of
gosh
the
engineering
peeping
peering
sneering
swank
of
gosh
in
gosh
sad
gosh
where
the
lord
swank
lives
he
holds
high
rank
and
he
has
much
pelf
and
all
the
posts
he
gives
unto
his
fawning
relatives
as
foolish
as
himself
in
offices
and
courts
and
boards
are
swanks
and
swanks
ten
dozen
swanks
and
cousin
swanks
in
hordes
inept
and
musty
dry
and
dusty
rusty
swanks
in
hordes
the
clouds
so
soft
that
sail
aloft
weep
laughing
tears
of
rain
the
blue
sky
spread
high
overhead
peeps
thro
in
mild
disdain
all
nature
laughs
and
jeers
and
chaffs
when
the
swank
goes
out
to
walk
but
every
glug
bows
low
his
head
and
says
in
tones
surcharged
with
dread
bow
low
bow
low
glugs
lean
glugs
fat
but
the
north
wind
snatches
off
his
hat
and
flings
it
high
and
shrieks
to
see
his
ruffled
dignity
they
lurk
in
every
lair
docket
dull
and
dusty
file
solemnly
squat
in
an
easy
chair
penning
a
minute
of
rare
hot
air
in
departmental
style
in
every
office
on
every
floor
are
swanks
and
swanks
distracting
swanks
and
a
score
and
coldly
distant
galore
in
peaceful
days
when
the
countryside
poured
wealth
to
gosh
and
the
skies
were
blue
the
great
king
splosh
no
fault
espied
and
seemed
entirely
satisfied
with
swanks
who
muddled
thro
but
when
they
fell
on
seasons
bad
oh
then
the
swanks
the
bustled
swanks
the
hustled
swanks
went
mad
the
skiting
swanks
went
mad
the
tall
trees
sway
like
boys
at
play
and
mock
him
when
he
grieves
as
one
by
one
in
laughing
fun
they
pelt
him
with
their
leaves
and
the
gay
green
trees
joke
to
the
breeze
as
the
swank
struts
proudly
by
but
every
glug
with
reverence
pays
homage
to
his
pride
immense
a
homage
deep
to
lofty
rank
the
swank
the
swank
the
pompous
swank
but
the
leaves
await
their
chance
and
round
him
gaily
dance
now
trouble
came
to
the
land
of
gosh
the
fear
of
battle
and
anxious
days
and
the
swanks
were
called
to
the
great
king
splosh
who
said
that
their
system
would
not
wash
and
ordered
other
ways
then
the
lord
high
swank
stretched
forth
a
paw
and
penned
a
minute
re
the
law
and
the
swanks
the
swanks
the
other
swanks
the
brother
swanks
said
haw
these
keen
resourceful
unremorseful
forceful
swanks
said
haw
then
splosh
the
king
in
a
royal
rage
he
smote
his
throne
as
he
thundered
bosh
in
the
whole
wide
land
is
there
not
one
sage
with
a
cool
clear
brain
who
straight
engage
to
sweep
the
swanks
from
gosh
but
the
lord
high
stodge
from
where
he
stood
cried
barley
guard
your
livelihood
and
quick
as
light
the
teeming
swanks
the
scheming
swanks
touched
wood
sages
plainly
labour
vainly
when
the
swanks
touch
wood
the
stealthy
cats
that
grace
the
mats
before
the
doors
of
gosh
smile
wide
with
scorn
each
sunny
morn
and
as
they
take
their
wash
a
sly
grimace
each
face
as
the
swank
struts
forth
to
court
but
every
glug
casts
down
his
eyes
and
mutters
ai
a
size
for
such
a
sight
our
gods
we
thank
sir
stodge
the
swank
the
noble
swank
but
the
west
wind
tweaks
his
nose
in
sport
and
the
swank
struts
into
court
then
roared
the
king
with
a
rage
intense
oh
who
can
cope
with
their
magic
tricks
but
the
lord
high
swank
skipped
nimbly
hence
and
hid
him
safe
behind
the
fence
of
regulation
vi
and
under
section
four
eight
the
swanks
the
swanks
dim
forms
of
swanks
the
swarms
of
swanks
lay
low
these
most
tenacious
perspicacious
spacious
swanks
lay
low
cried
the
king
of
gosh
they
shall
not
escape
am
i
set
at
naught
by
a
crazed
buffoon
but
in
fifty
fathoms
of
thin
red
tape
the
lord
swank
swaddled
his
portly
shape
like
a
large
insane
cocoon
then
round
and
round
and
round
and
round
the
swanks
the
swanks
the
whirling
swanks
the
twirling
swanks
they
wound
the
swathed
and
swaddled
swanks
inanely
wound
each
insect
thing
that
comes
in
spring
to
gladden
this
sad
earth
it
flits
and
whirls
and
pipes
and
skirls
it
chirps
in
mocking
mirth
a
merry
song
the
whole
day
long
to
see
the
swank
abroad
but
every
glug
he
be
salutes
with
grave
humility
and
deference
to
noble
rank
the
swank
the
swank
the
swollen
swank
but
the
south
wind
blows
his
clothes
awry
and
flings
dust
in
his
eye
so
trouble
stayed
in
the
land
of
gosh
and
the
futile
glugs
could
only
gape
while
the
lord
high
swank
still
ruled
king
splosh
with
laws
of
blither
and
rules
of
bosh
from
out
his
lair
of
tape
and
in
cocoons
that
mocked
the
glug
the
swanks
the
swanks
the
the
dunder
swanks
lay
snug
these
most
politic
parasitic
critic
swanks
lay
snug
then
mourn
with
me
for
a
luckless
land
oh
weep
with
me
for
the
slaves
of
tape
where
the
lord
high
swank
still
held
command
and
wrote
new
rules
in
a
fair
round
hand
and
the
glugs
saw
no
escape
where
tape
entwined
all
gluggish
things
and
the
swank
the
swank
the
grievous
swank
the
devious
swank
pulled
strings
the
perspicacious
contumacious
swank
held
all
the
strings
the
blooms
that
grow
and
in
a
row
peep
each
garden
fence
they
nod
and
smile
to
note
his
style
of
ponderous
pretence
each
roving
bee
has
fits
of
glee
when
the
swank
goes
by
that
way
but
every
glug
he
makes
his
bow
and
says
just
watch
him
watch
him
now
he
must
have
thousands
in
the
bank
the
swank
the
swank
the
holy
swank
but
the
wild
winds
snatch
his
kerchief
out
and
buffet
him
about
viii
the
seer
somewhere
or
other
is
doubtful
where
in
the
archives
of
gosh
is
a
volume
rare
a
precious
old
classic
that
nobody
reads
and
nobody
asks
for
and
nobody
heeds
which
makes
it
a
classic
and
famed
thro
the
land
as
persons
will
quite
understand
is
a
ponderous
work
and
is
written
in
prose
for
some
mystical
reason
that
nobody
knows
and
it
tells
in
a
style
that
is
terse
and
correct
of
the
rule
of
the
swanks
and
its
baneful
effect
on
the
commerce
of
gosh
on
its
morals
and
trade
and
it
quotes
a
grave
prophecy
somebody
made
and
this
is
the
prophecy
written
right
bold
on
a
parchment
all
tattered
and
yellow
and
old
so
old
and
so
tattered
that
nobody
knows
how
far
into
foretime
its
origin
goes
but
this
is
the
writing
that
set
glugs
agog
when
was
called
to
their
minds
by
the
mayor
of
quog
when
gosh
groaneth
bastlie
thro
greed
and
bys
plannes
ye
rimer
shall
mende
ye
who
mendes
pottes
and
pans
now
the
mayor
of
quog
a
small
suburb
of
gosh
was
intensely
annoyed
at
the
act
of
king
splosh
in
asking
the
mayor
of
piphel
to
tea
with
himself
and
the
queen
on
a
thursday
at
three
when
the
king
must
have
known
that
the
sorriest
dog
if
a
native
of
piphel
was
hated
in
quog
an
act
without
precedent
quog
was
ignored
the
mayor
and
council
and
charity
board
they
met
and
considered
this
insult
to
quog
and
they
said
is
the
work
of
the
treacherous
og
is
plain
the
og
influence
threatens
the
throne
and
the
swanks
are
all
crazed
with
this
trading
in
stone
said
the
mayor
of
quog
this
has
long
been
foretold
in
a
prophecy
penned
by
the
seer
of
old
we
must
search
if
we
banish
the
curse
of
our
time
for
a
mender
of
pots
who
a
maker
of
rhyme
is
to
him
we
must
look
when
our
luck
goes
amiss
but
oh
where
in
all
gosh
is
a
glug
such
as
this
then
the
mayor
and
council
and
charity
board
the
archival
prophecy
zealously
pored
with
a
pursing
of
lips
and
a
shaking
of
heads
with
a
searching
and
prying
for
possible
threads
that
would
lead
to
discover
this
versatile
glug
who
modelled
a
rhyme
while
he
mended
a
mug
with
a
pursing
of
lips
and
a
shaking
of
heads
they
gave
up
the
task
and
went
home
to
their
beds
where
each
lay
awake
while
he
tortured
his
brain
for
a
key
to
the
riddle
but
ever
in
vain
then
lo
at
the
mayor
front
door
in
the
morn
a
tinker
called
out
and
a
movement
was
born
kettles
and
pans
kettles
and
pans
oh
the
stars
are
the
gods
but
the
earth
it
is
man
but
a
fool
is
the
man
who
has
wants
without
end
while
the
tinker
content
with
a
kettle
to
mend
for
a
tinker
owns
naught
but
the
earth
which
is
man
then
bring
out
your
kettles
ho
kettles
and
pans
from
the
mayoral
bed
with
unmayoral
cries
the
magistrate
sprang
ere
he
opened
his
eyes
hold
him
he
yelled
as
he
bounced
on
the
floor
oh
who
is
this
tinker
that
rhymes
at
my
door
go
get
me
the
name
and
the
title
of
him
they
answered
be
calm
sir
is
no
one
but
sym
is
sym
the
mad
tinker
the
son
of
old
joi
who
ran
from
his
home
when
a
bit
of
a
boy
he
went
for
a
tramp
tho
is
common
belief
when
folk
were
not
looking
he
went
for
a
thief
then
went
for
a
tinker
and
rhymes
as
he
goes
some
say
he
crazy
but
nobody
knows
was
thus
it
began
the
exalting
of
sym
and
the
mad
gluggish
struggle
that
raged
around
him
for
the
good
mayor
seized
him
and
clothed
him
in
silk
and
fed
him
on
pumpkins
and
pasteurised
milk
and
praised
him
in
public
and
coupled
his
name
with
gosh
vague
prophet
of
archival
fame
the
press
interviewed
him
a
great
many
times
and
printed
his
portrait
and
published
his
rhymes
till
the
king
and
sir
stodge
and
the
swanks
grew
afraid
of
his
fame
the
glugs
and
the
trouble
it
made
for
wherever
sym
went
in
the
city
of
gosh
there
were
cheers
for
the
tinker
and
hoots
for
king
splosh
his
goings
and
comings
were
watched
for
and
cheered
and
a
crowd
quickly
gathered
he
appeared
all
the
folk
flocked
around
him
and
shouted
his
praise
for
the
glugs
followed
fashion
and
sym
was
a
craze
they
sued
him
for
words
which
they
greeted
with
cheers
for
the
way
with
a
glug
is
to
tickle
his
ears
speak
to
us
tinker
your
wisdom
we
crave
they
cry
when
they
saw
him
then
sym
would
look
grave
and
remark
with
an
air
is
a
very
fine
day
now
ai
he
a
marvel
they
shout
hip
hooray
to
live
would
sym
answer
to
live
is
to
feel
and
ai
he
a
poet
a
fat
glug
would
squeal
sym
had
a
quaint
fancy
in
phrase
and
in
text
when
he
fed
them
with
one
they
would
howl
for
the
next
thus
he
cry
love
is
love
and
the
welkin
they
lift
with
their
shouts
of
surprise
at
his
wonderful
gift
he
would
say
after
life
then
a
glug
must
meet
death
and
they
clamour
for
more
ere
he
took
the
next
breath
but
sym
grew
aweary
of
this
sort
of
praise
and
he
longed
to
be
back
with
his
days
with
his
feet
in
the
grass
and
his
back
to
a
tree
rhyming
and
tinkering
fameless
and
free
he
said
so
one
day
to
the
mayor
of
quog
and
declared
he
as
lief
live
the
life
of
a
dog
but
the
mayor
was
vexed
for
the
movement
had
grown
and
his
dreams
had
of
late
soared
as
high
as
a
throne
have
a
care
what
is
written
is
written
said
he
and
the
dullest
glug
knows
what
is
written
must
be
is
the
prophet
of
gosh
who
has
prophesied
it
and
is
thus
that
is
written
by
him
who
so
writ
the
tinker
of
gosh
he
shall
make
him
three
rhymes
one
on
the
errors
and
aims
of
his
times
one
on
the
symptoms
of
sin
that
he
sees
and
the
third
and
the
last
on
whatever
he
please
and
when
the
glugs
hear
them
and
mark
what
they
mean
the
land
shall
be
purged
and
the
nation
made
clean
so
sym
gave
a
promise
to
write
then
and
there
three
rhymes
to
be
read
in
the
great
market
square
to
all
glugs
assembled
on
saturday
week
and
then
said
the
mayor
if
still
you
must
seek
to
return
to
your
tramping
well
just
have
your
fling
but
i
make
you
a
marquis
or
any
old
thing
said
sym
i
shall
tinker
and
still
be
a
king
ix
the
rhymes
of
sym
nobody
knew
why
it
should
be
so
nobody
knew
or
wanted
to
know
it
might
have
been
checked
had
but
someone
dared
to
trace
its
beginnings
but
nobody
cared
but
was
clear
to
the
wise
that
the
glugs
of
those
days
were
crazed
beyond
reason
concerning
a
craze
they
would
pass
a
thing
by
for
a
week
or
a
year
with
an
air
apathetic
or
maybe
a
sneer
some
thing
like
a
crime
or
a
creed
a
mode
or
a
movement
and
pay
it
small
heed
till
somebody
started
to
laud
it
aloud
then
all
but
the
nobodies
followed
the
crowd
thus
sym
was
a
craze
tho
to
give
him
his
due
he
would
rather
have
strayed
from
the
popular
view
but
once
the
glugs
had
him
they
held
him
so
tight
that
he
could
not
be
nobody
try
as
he
might
he
had
to
be
somebody
so
they
decreed
for
craze
is
an
appetite
governed
by
greed
so
on
saturday
week
to
the
great
market
square
came
every
glug
who
could
rake
up
his
fare
they
came
from
the
suburbs
they
came
from
the
town
there
came
from
the
country
glugs
bearded
and
brown
rich
glugs
with
cigars
all
and
stout
jostled
commonplace
glugs
who
dropped
aitches
about
there
were
gushing
glug
maids
well
aware
of
their
charms
and
stern
massive
matrons
with
babes
in
their
arms
there
were
querulous
dames
who
complained
of
the
squash
the
pushing
and
squeezing
for
briefly
all
gosh
with
its
aunt
and
its
wife
stood
agape
in
the
ranks
excepting
sir
stodge
and
his
satellite
swanks
the
mayor
of
quog
took
the
chair
for
the
day
and
he
made
them
a
speech
and
he
ventured
to
say
that
a
glug
was
a
glug
and
the
cause
they
held
dear
was
a
very
dear
cause
and
the
glugs
said
hear
hear
then
sym
took
the
stage
to
a
round
of
applause
from
thousands
who
suddenly
found
they
a
cause
the
first
rhyme
of
sym
we
strive
together
in
life
crowded
mart
with
clutching
hands
to
we
scheme
we
lie
we
play
the
selfish
part
masking
our
lust
for
gain
with
gentle
speech
and
masking
too
o
pity
ignorance
our
very
selves
behind
a
careless
glance
ah
foolish
brothers
seeking
in
vain
the
one
dear
gift
that
liesso
near
at
hand
hoping
to
barter
gold
we
meanly
gain
for
that
the
poorest
beggar
in
the
land
holds
for
his
own
to
hoard
while
yet
he
spends
seeking
fresh
treasure
in
the
hearts
of
friends
we
preach
yet
do
we
deem
it
to
count
unbounded
a
shame
so
ban
the
from
out
our
eyes
lest
sparks
of
sympathy
be
fanned
to
flame
we
smile
and
yet
withhold
in
secret
fear
the
word
so
hard
to
speak
so
sweet
to
hear
the
open
sesame
to
meanest
hearts
the
magic
word
to
which
stern
eyes
grow
soft
and
crafty
faces
that
the
cruel
marts
have
seared
and
scored
turn
gentle
nay
how
oft
it
trembles
on
the
lip
to
die
unppoke
and
dawning
love
is
stifled
with
a
joke
nay
brothers
look
about
your
world
a
world
to
you
so
drab
so
commonplace
the
flowers
still
are
blooming
by
the
way
as
blossom
smiles
upon
the
sternest
face
in
everv
hour
is
born
some
thought
of
love
in
every
heart
is
hid
some
with
a
modified
clapping
and
stamping
of
feet
the
glugs
mildly
cheered
him
as
sym
took
his
seat
but
some
said
was
clever
and
some
said
was
more
especially
those
who
did
not
understand
and
some
said
with
frowns
tho
the
words
sounded
plain
yet
it
had
a
deep
meaning
they
craved
to
explain
but
the
mayor
said
silence
he
wished
to
observe
that
a
glug
was
a
glug
and
in
wishing
to
serve
this
glorious
cause
which
they
asked
him
to
lead
they
had
proved
they
were
glugs
of
the
noble
old
breed
that
made
gosh
what
it
was
and
he
ask
the
police
to
remove
that
small
boy
while
they
heard
the
next
piece
the
second
rhyme
of
sym
now
come
said
the
devil
he
said
to
me
with
his
swart
face

this
day

and
my
heart

pure
come
show
me
a
sign
of
the
sin
you
see
but
the
devil
was
gone
and
the
clock
struck
three
with
an
increase
of
cheering
and
waving
of
while
the
little
boys
squealed
and
made
noises
like
cats
the
glugs
gave
approval
to
sym
second
rhyme
and
some
said
was
thoughtful
and
some
said
was
prime
and
some
said
was
witty
and
had
a
fine
end
more
especially
those
who
did
not
comprehend
and
some
said
with
leers
and
with
nudges
and
shrugs
that
they
mentioned
no
names
but
it
hit
certain
glugs
and
others
remarked
with
superior
smiles
while
dividing
the
metrical
feet
into
miles
that
the
thing
seemed
quite
simple
without
any
doubt
but
the
anagrams
in
it
would
need
thinking
out
but
the
mayor
said
hush
and
he
wished
to
explain
that
in
leading
this
movement
he
nothing
to
gain
he
was
ready
to
lead
since
they
trusted
him
so
and
wherever
he
led
he
was
sure
glugs
would
go
and
he
thanked
them
again
and
craved
peace
for
a
time
while
this
gifted
young
man
read
his
third
and
last
rhyme
the
last
rhyme
of
sym
to
sing
you
a
song
and
a
sensible
song
is
a
worthy
and
excellent
thing
but
how
could
i
sing
you
that
sort
of
a
song
if
there
never
a
song
to
sing
at
ten
to
the
tick
by
the
kitchen
clock
i
marked
him
blundering
by
with
his
eyes
astare
and
his
rumpled
hair
and
his
hat
cocked
over
his
eye
blind
in
his
pride
to
his
shoes
untied
he
went
with
a
swift
off
on
the
quest
with
a
strange
unrest
hunting
the
feasible
dog
and
this
is
the
song
as
he
dashed
along
that
he
sang
with
a
swaggering
swing
now
how
had
i
heard
him
singing
a
song
if
he
had
a
song
to
sing
i
found
the
authentic
identical
beast
the
feasible
dog
and
the
terror
of
gosh
i
know
by
the
prowl
of
him
hark
to
the
growl
of
him
heralding
death
to
the
subjects
of
splosh
oh
look
at
him
glaring
and
staring
by
thunder
now
each
for
himself
and
the
weakest
goes
under
beware
this
injurious
furious
brute
he
ready
to
rend
you
with
tooth
and
with
claw
tho
is
incredible
anything
edible
disappears
suddenly
into
his
maw
into
his
cavernous
inner
interior
vanishes
evrything
strictly
superior
he
calls
it
woman
he
calls
it
wine
he
calls
it
devils
and
dice
he
calls
it
surfing
and
sunday
golf
and
names
that
are
not
so
nice
but
whatever
he
calls
morals
or
mirth
is
on
with
the
hunt
right
quick
for
his
sorrow
he
hug
like
a
gloomy
gllig
if
he
had
a
dog
to
kick
so
any
old
night
if
the
stars
are
right
vou
will
find
him
hot
on
the
trail
of
a
feasible
dog
and
a
teasable
dog
with
a
can
to
tie
to
his
tail
and
the
song
that
he
roars
to
the
shuddering
stars
is
a
worthy
and
excellent
thing
yet
how
could
you
hear
him
singing
a
song
if
there
was
a
song
to
sing
i
watched
his
abdominous
ominous
shape
abroad
in
the
land
while
the
nation
has
slept
marked
his
satanical
methods
tyrannical
rigorous
vigorous
vigil
i
kept
good
gracious
voracious
is
hardly
the
name
for
it
yet
we
have
only
our
blindness
to
blame
for
it
my
dear
i
autoptical
optical
proof
that
he
prowling
and
growling
at
large
in
the
land
hear
his
pestiferous
clamour
vociferous
gurgles
and
groans
of
the
beastliest
brand
some
may
regard
his
contortions
as
comical
but
i
the
proof
that
his
game
gastronomical
beware
this
obstreperous
leprous
beast
a
treacherous
wretch
for
i
know
him
of
old
i
on
the
track
of
him
close
at
the
back
of
him
and
i
aware
his
ambitions
are
bold
for
he
yearning
and
burning
to
snare
the
superior
into
his
roomy
and
gloomy
interior
such
a
shouting
and
yelling
of
hearty
bravoes
such
a
craning
of
necks
and
a
standing
on
toes
seemed
to
leave
a
doubt
that
the
tinker
last
rhyme
had
now
won
him
repute
the
glugs
for
all
time
and
they
all
said
the
rhyme
was
the
grandest
they
heard
more
especially
those
who
had
not
caught
a
word
but
the
mayor
said
peace
and
he
stood
without
fear
as
the
leader
of
all
to
whom
justice
was
dear
for
the
tinker
had
rhymed
as
the
prophet
foretold
and
a
light
was
let
in
on
the
errors
of
old
for
in
every
line
and
in
every
verse
was
the
proof
that
sir
stodge
was
a
traitor
and
worse
sir
stodge
said
the
mayor
must
go
from
his
place
and
the
swanks
one
and
all
were
a
standing
disgrace
for
the
influence
won
a
weak
foolish
king
was
a
menace
to
gosh
and
a
scandalous
thing
and
now
said
the
mayor
i
stand
here
as
your
leader
and
friend
and
the
glugs
said
hooray
then
they
went
to
their
homes
in
the
suburbs
and
town
to
their
farms
went
the
glugs
who
were
bearded
and
brown
portly
glugs
with
cigars
went
to
dine
at
their
clubs
while
illiterate
glugs
had
one
more
at
the
pubs
and
each
household
in
gosh
sat
and
talked
half
the
night
of
the
wonderful
day
and
the
imminent
fight
forgetting
the
rhymer
forgetting
his
rhymes
they
talked
of
sir
stodge
and
his
numerous
crimes
there
was
hardly
a
in
the
whole
land
of
gosh
who
a
lenient
word
to
put
in
for
king
splosh
one
and
all
to
the
mangiest
surliest
dog
were
quite
eager
to
bark
for
his
worship
of
quog
forgotten
unnoticed
sym
wended
his
way
to
his
lodging
in
gosh
at
the
close
of
the
day
and
was
there
to
his
friend
and
companion
of
years
to
his
little
red
dog
with
the
funny
prick
ears
that
he
poured
out
his
woe
seeking
nothing
to
hide
and
the
little
dog
listened
his
head
on
one
side
o
you
little
red
dog
you
are
weary
as
i
it
is
days
it
is
months
since
we
saw
the
blue
sky
and
it
seems
weary
years
since
we
sniffed
at
the
breeze
as
it
hms
thro
the
hedges
and
sings
in
the
trees
these
we
know
and
we
love
but
this
city
holds
fears
o
my
friend
of
the
road
with
the
funny
prick
ears
and
for
what
me
we
hope
from
his
worship
of
quog
oh
and
a
bone
and
a
kick
said
the
little
red
dog
x
the
debate
he
was
a
glug
of
simple
charm
he
wished
no
living
creature
harm
his
kindly
smile
like
sunlight
fell
on
all
about
and
wished
them
well
yet
the
cheerful
soul
of
sym
the
great
sir
stodge
detested
him
the
stern
sir
stodge
and
all
his
swanks
proud
glugs
of
divers
grades
and
ranks
with
learning
and
attainments
great
had
never
learned
to
conquer
hate
and
failing
in
their
a

thus
that

famous
schools
turned
out
great
hordes
of
learned
fools
turned
out
the
ship
without
a
sail
turned
out
the
kite
with
leaden
tail
turned
out
the
mind
that
could
not
soar
because
of
foolish
weights
it
bore
because
there
been
no
father
joi
to
guide
the
quick
mind
of
a
boy
away
from
thoughts
of
hate
and
blame
wisdom
in
these
was
but
a
name
but
the
glugs
they
count
him
wise
who
walks
with
cunning
in
his
eyes
his
task
well
done
his
three
rhymes
writ

at
morn
and
packed
his
kit
at
last
he
cried
off
and
away
to
meet
again
the
spendthrift
day
as
he
comes
climbing
in
the
east
to
bless
with
largesse
man
and
beast

the
fields
where
wild
things

of

be
at
hand
but
what
am
i
such
great
men
his
worship
winked
his
eye
again
was
monday
in
the
market
square
sir
stodge
and
all
his
swanks
were
there
and
almost
every
glug
in
gosh
had
bolted
lunch
and
had
a
wash
and
cleaned
his
boots
and
sallied
out
to
gloat
upon
sir
stodge
rout
and
certain
sly
and
knowing
glugs
with
sundry
nudges
winks
and
shrugs
passed
round
the
hint
that
up
on
high
behind
some
window
near
the
sky
where
he
could
see
yet
not
be
seen
king
splosh
was
present
with
his
queen
glugs
said
the
chairman
glugs
of
gosh
by
order
of
our
good
king
splosh
the
tinker
and
sir
stodge
shall
meet
and
here
without
unseemly
heat
debate
the
question
of
the
day
which
is
however
let
me
say
i
do
not
wish
to
waste
your
time
so
first
shall
speak
this
man
of
rhyme
and
when
sir
stodge
has
voiced
his
view
the
glugs
shall
judge
between
the
two
this
verdict
from
the
folk
of
gosh
will
be
accepted
by
king
splosh
as
when
like
teasing
vagabonds
the
sly
winds
buffet
sullen
ponds
the
face
of
stodge
grew
dark
with
rage
when
sym
stepped
forth
upon
the
stage
but
all
the
glugs
with
one
accord
a
chorus
of
approval
roared
said
sym
kind
friends
and
fellow
glugs
my
trade
is
mending
pots
and
mugs
i
tinker
kettles
and
i
rhyme
to
please
myself
and
pass
the
time
just
as
my
fancy
wandereth
he
minel
quoth
stodge
below
his
breath
said
sym
why
i
am
here
i
know
not
tho
i
heard
them
say
that
strife
and
hatred
play
some
part
in
this
great
meeting
at
the
mart
nay
brothers
why
should
hatred
lodge
that
ultra
vires
thundered
stodge
is
ultra
vires
cried
the
knight
besides
it
is
half
polite
and
the
dullest
glug
should
know
is
not
pro
bono
publico
nay
glugs
this
fellow
is
no
class
remember
vincit
veritas
with
sidelong
looks
and
sheepish
grins
like
men
found
out
in
secret
sins
glug
gazed
at
glug
in
nervous
dread
till
one
with
claims
to
learning
said
sir
stodge
is
talking
greek
you
know
he
may
be
bad
but
never
low
then
those
who
had
no
word
of
greek
felt
lifted
up
to
hear
him
speak
ah
learning
learning
others
said
is
fine
to
have
a
clever
head
and
here
and
there
a
nervous
cheer
was
heard
and
someone
growled
hear
hear
kind
friends
said
sym
but
at
a
glance
the
sir
stodge
had
seen
his
chance
quid
nuncl
he
cried
o
noble
glugs
this
fellow
takes
you
all
for
mugs
i
ask
him
where
his
quid
pro
quo
i
ask
again
quo
warranto
shall
this
man
filch
our
wits
from
us
with
his
furor
poeticus
nay
cried
sir
stodge
you
must
agree
if
you
will
hark
a
while
to
me
and
at
the
glugs
collective
head
he
flung
strange
language
ages
dead
with
mystic
phrases
from
the
law
with
many
an
old
and
rusty
saw
with
mottoes
which
he
took
haphazard
from
the
for
half
an
hour
the
learned
knight
belaboured
them
with
all
his
might
and
as
they
wakened
from
their
daze
their
murmurs
grew
to
shouts
of
praise
glugs
who
reviled
him
overnight
all
in
a
moment
saw
the
light
o
learned
man
seer
cried
they
and
education
won
the
day
then
quickly
to
sir
stodge
side
there
bounded
in
a
single
stride
his
nibs
of
quog
and
flinging
wide
his
arms
o
victory
he
cried
i
with
sir
stodge
glugs
of
gosh
and
we
have
won
long
live
king
splosh
then
pointing
angrily
at
sym
cried
quog
this
is
the
end
of
him
for
months
i
marked
his
crafty
dodge
to
bring
dishonour
to
sir
stodge
i
lured
him
here
the
traitrous
dog
and
shamed
him
quoth
his
nibs
of
quog
hoots
for
the
tinker
tore
the
air
as
sym
went
wisely
otherwhere
cheers
for
sir
stodge
were
long
and
loud
and
as
amid
his
swanks
he
bowed
to
mark
his
thanks
and
honest
pride
his
nibs
of
quog
bowed
by
his
side
the
thursday
after
that
at
three
the
king
invited
quog
to
tea
quoth
quog
it
was
a
task
to
bilk
i
thank
you
sugar
please
and
milk
to
bilk
this
tinker
and
his
pranks
a
scurvy
rogue
ah
two
lumps
thanks
a
scurvy
rogue
continued
quog
was
easy
to
outwit
the
dog
altho
perhaps
i
risked
my
life
i
heard
he
handy
with
a
knife
ah
well
was
for
my
country
sake
thanks
just
one
slice
of
currant
cake
xi
ogs
it
chanced
one
day
in
the
middle
of
may
there
came
to
the
great
king
splosh
a
policeman
who
said
while
scratching
his
head
there
is
a
stone
in
gosh
to
throw
at
a
dog
for
the
crafty
og
last
saturday
week
at
one
took
our
last
in
order
to
settle
a
bill
for
a
toy
said
the
king
jokingly
why
how
provokingly
weird
but
we
have
the
gun
and
the
king
said
well
we
are
but
the
queen
could
not
see
it
was
much
of
a
joke
and
she
said
if
the
metal
is
all
used
up
pray
what
of
the
costume
i
want
for
the
cup
it
all
seems
so
dreadfully
simple
to
me
the
stones
why
import
them
from
over
the
sea
but
a
glug
stood
up
with
a
mole
on
his
chin
and
said
with
a
most
diabolical
grin
your
majesties
down
in
the
country
of
podge
a
spy
has
discovered
a
very
dodge
and
the
ogs
are
determined
to
wage
a
war
on
gosh
next
friday
at
four
then
the
glugs
all
cried
in
a
terrible
fright
how
did
our
grandfathers
manage
a
fight
then
the
knight
sir
stodge
he
opened
his
book
and
he
read
some
very
large
stones
they
took
and
flung
at
the
foe
with
exceeding
force
which
was
very
effective
tho
rude
of
course
and
lo
with
sorrowful
wails
and
moans
the
glugs
cried
where
oh
where
are
the
stones
and
some
rushed
north
and
a
few
ran
west
seeking
the
substitutes
seeming
best
and
they
gathered
the
pillows
and
cushions
and
rugs
from
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
glugs
and
a
hasty
message
they
managed
to
send
craving
the
loan
of
some
bricks
from
a
friend
on
the
friday
exactly
at
four
came
the
ogs
with
triumphant
glee
and
the
first
of
their
stones
hit
poor
mister
ghones
the
captain
of
industry
then
a
pebble
of
podge
took
the
knight
sir
stodge
in
the
curve
of
his
convex
vest
he
gurgled
his
heart
growing
sluggish
he
solemnly
sank
to
rest
is
inconceivable
scarcely
believable
yet
he
was
sent
to
rest
and
the
king
said
ouch
and
the
queen
said
my
what
shall
i
do
but
the
warlike
ogs
they
hurled
great
rocks
thro
the
works
of
the
wonderful
clocks
they
had
sold
to
the
glugs
but
a
month
before
which
was
very
absurd
but
of
course
was
war
and
the
glugs
cried
what
would
our
grandfathers
do
if
they
had
the
stones
that
they
one
time
threw
but
the
knight
sir
stodge
and
his
mystic
book
oblivious
slept
in
a
nook
then
a
glug
stood
out
with
a
pot
in
his
hand
as
the
king
was
bewailing
the
fate
of
his
land
and
he
said
if
these
ogs
you
desire
to
retard
then
hit
them
quite
frequent
with
anything
hard
so
the
glugs
seized
anvils
and
editors
chairs
and
smote
the
ogs
with
them
unawares
and
bottles
of
pickles
and
clocks
they
threw
and
books
of
poems
and
gherkins
and
glue
which
they
bought
with
the
stones
as
of
course
you
know
from
the
ogs
but
a
couple
of
months
ago
which
was
simply
inane
when
you
reason
it
and
uneconomic
but
then
it
was
war
when
they
fought
for
a
night
and
the
most
of
a
day
the
ogs
threw
the
last
of
their
metal
away
then
they
went
back
to
podge
well
content
with
their
fun
and
with
much
satisfaction
declared
they
had
won
and
the
king
of
the
glugs
gazed
around
on
his
land
and
saw
nothing
but
stones
strewn
on
every
hand
great
stones
in
the
palace
and
stones
in
the
street
and
stones
on
the
and
under
the
feet
and
he
said
with
a
desperate
look
on
his
face
there
is
nothing
so
ghastly
as
stones
out
of
place
and
no
doubt
this
og
scheme
was
a
very
smart
dodge
but
whom
does
it
profit
my
people
or
podge
xii
emily
ann
government
muddles
departments
dazed
fear
and
confusion
wherever
he
gazed
order
insulted
authority
spurned
dread
and
distraction
wherever
he
turned
oh
the
great
king
splosh
was
a
sad
sore
king
with
never
a
statesman
to
straighten
the
thing
glus
all
importunate
urging
their
claims
with
selfish
intent
and
ulterior
aims
glugs
with
petitions
for
this
and
for
that
standing
on
the
royal
raging
when
nobody
answered
their
ring
oh
the
great
king
splosh
was
a
careworn
king
and
he
looked
to
the
right
and
he
glanced
to
the
left
and
he
glared
at
the
roof
like
a
monarch
bereft
of
his
wisdom
and
wits
and
his
wealth
all
in
one
and
at
least
once
a
minute
asked
what
to
be
done
but
the
swanks
stood
around
him
and
answered
with
groans
your
majesty
gosh
is
half
buried
in
stones
how
now
cried
the
king
is
there
not
in
my
land
one
glug
who
can
cope
with
this
dreadful
demand
a
rich
man
a
poor
man
a
beggar

i
reck
not
his
rank
so
he
lessen
my
grief

soldier

sailor
a
raising
his
head
with
relief
in
his
eye
now
i
mind
me
he
said
i
mind
me
a
tinker
and
what
once
befel
when
i
think
on
the
whole
he
was
treated
not
well
but
he
shall
be
honoured
and
he
shall
be
famed
if
he
read
me
this
riddle
but
how
is
he
named
some
commonplace
title
go
send
out
my
riders
and
scour
gosh
for
him
they
rode
for
a
day
to
the
sea
in
the
south
calling
the
name
of
him
hand
to
the
mouth
they
rode
for
a
day
to
the
hills
in
the
east
but
signs
of
a
tinker
saw
never
the
least
then
they
rode
to
the
north
thro
a
whole
day
long
and
paused
in
the
even
to
hark
to
a
song
kettles
and
pans

oh
who
can
show
tresses
like

as

tinkering
mending
a
pan
singing
as
only
a
merry
man
can
sym
cried
the
is
thus
you
are
styled
and
he
paused
in
his
singing
and
nodded
and
smiled

he
last
eve
when
the
sun
was
low
down
thro
the
bracken
i
watched
her
go
down
thro
the
bracken
with
simple
grace
and
the
glory
of
eve
shone
full
on
her
face
and
there
on
the
it
lingered
a
span
so
loth
to
be
leaving
my
emily
arm
with
hands
to
their
faces
the
riders
smiled
sym
they
said

frolicked
and

eager
to
greet

with
a
king

answered
them
emily

he
whenever

skirts

high

twinkling

where
this
morn
she
ran

doubly
jewelled
for
emily

cried
by

a
blessing
and
boon
for

the
gifts

give

he
whistled
him
once
to
his
little
red
dog
into
the
meadow
and
over
the
stile
off
went
the
tinker

singing

down
by
the
bracken

over
the
hill
with
the
little
red
dog
at
the

the

still
live
in

of

under
the
rule
of
the
great
king
splosh
and
they
climb
the
trees
in
the
summer
and
spring
because
it
is
reckoned
the
regular
thing
down
in
the
valley
they
live
their
lives
taking
the
air
with
their

wives
and
they
climb
the
trees
in
the
winter
and
fall
and
count
it
improper
to
climb
not
at
all
and
they
name
their
trees
with
a
thousand
names
calling
them
after
their
arts
and
aims
and
some
they
climb
for
the
fun

go
up
at
the
call
of
the
king
some
scale
a
tree
that
they
fear
to
name
for
it
bears
great
blossoms
of
scarlet
shame
but
they
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
nameless
tree
because
they
are
glugs
and
their
choice
is
free
but
every
eve
when
the
sun
goes
west
over
the
mountain
they
call
the
blest
whose
summit
looks
down
on
the
city
of
gosh
far
from
the
reach
of
the
great
king
splosh
the
glugs
gaze
up
at
the
heights
above
and
feel
vague
promptings
to
wondrous
love
and
they
whisper
a
tale
of
a
tinker
man
who
lives
in
the
mount
with
his
emily
ann
a
great
mother
mountain
and
kindly
is
she
who
nurses
young
rivers
and
sends
them
to
sea
and
nestled
high
up
on
her
sheltering
lap
is
a
little
red
house
with
a
little
straw
cap
that
bears
a
blue
feather
of
smoke
curling
high
and
a
bunch
of
red
roses
cocked
over
one
eye
and
the
eyes
of
it
glisten
and
shine
in
the
sun
as
they
look
down
on
gosh
with
a
twinkle
of
fun
there
a
gay
little
garden
a
tidy
white
gate
and
a
narrow
brown
pathway
that
will
not
run
straight
for
it
turns
and
it
twists
and
it
wanders
about
to
the
left
and
the
right
as
in
humorous
doubt
is
a
humorous
path
and
a
joke
from
its
birth
till
it
ends
at
the
door
with
a
wriggle
of
mirth
and
here
in
the
mount
lives
the
queer
tinker
man
with
his
little
red
dog
and
his
emily
arm
and
once
in
a
while
when
the
weather
is
clear
when
the
work
is
all
over
and
even
is
near
they
walk
in
the
garden
and
gaze
down
below
on
the
valley
of
gosh
where
the
young
rivers
go
where
the
houses
of
gosh
seem
so
paltry
and
vain
like
a
handful
of
pebbles
strewn
over
the
plain
where
tiny
black
forms
crawl
about
in
the
vale
and
stare
at
the
mountain
they
fear
them
to
scale
and
sym
sits
him
down
by
his
little
wife
knee
with
his
feet
in
the
grass
and
his
back
to
a
tree
and
he
looks
on
the
valley
and
dreams
of
old
years
as
he
strokes
his
red
dog
with
the
funny
prick
ears
and
he
says
still
they
climb
in
their
whimsical
way
while
we
stand
on
earth
yet
are
higher
than
they
oh
who
trusts
to
a
tree
is
a
fool
of
a
man
for
the
wise
seek
the
mountains
my
emily
ann
so
lives
the
queer
tinker
nor
deems
it
a
wrong
when
the
spirit
so
moves
him
to
burst
into
song
is
a
comical
song
about
kettles
and
pans
and
the
graces
and
charms
that
are
emily
ann
is
a
mad
freakish
song
but
he
sings
it
with
zest
and
his
little
wife
vows
it
of
all
songs
the
best
and
he
sings
quite
a
lot
as
the
summer
days
pass
with
his
back
to
a
tree
and
his
feet
in
the
grass
and
the
little
red
dog
who
is
wise
as
dogs
go
he
will
hark
to
that
song
for
a
minute
or
so
his
head
on
one
side
and
a
serious
air
then
he
makes
no
remark
but
he
wanders
elsewhere
and
he
trots
down
the
garden
to
gaze
now
and
then
at
the
curious
pranks
of
a
certain
blue
wren
not
a
commonplace
wren
but
a
bird
marked
for
fame
thro
a
grievance
in
life
and
a
definite
aim
now
they
never
fly
far
and
they
never
fly
high
and
they
probably
could
suppose
they
should
try
so
the
common
blue
wren
is
content
with
his
lot
he
will
eat
when
there
food
and
he
fasts
when
there
not
he
flirts
and
he
flutters
his
wife
by
his
side
with
his
share
of
content
and
forgiveable
pride
and
he
keeps
to
the
earth
the
bushes
and
shrubs
and
he
dines
very
well
upon
corpulent
grubs
but
the
little
blue
wren
with
a
grievance
in
life
he
was
rude
to
his
neighbours
and
short
with
his
wife
for
up
in
the
over
his
nest
there
dwelt
a
fat
spider
who
gave
him
no
rest
a
spider
so
fat
so
abnormally
stout
that
he
seemed
hardly
fitted
to
waddle
about
but
his
eyes
were
so
sharp
and
his
legs
were
so
spry
that
he
could
not
be
caught
and
was
folly
to
try
said
the
wren
as
his
loud
lamentations
he
hurled
at
the
little
red
dog
it
a
rotten
old
world
but
my
heart
would
be
glad
and
my
life
would
be
blest
if
i
had
that
fat
spider
well
under
my
vest
then
i
call
back
my
youth
and
be
seeking
to
live
and
to
taste
of
the
pleasures
the
world
has
to
give
but
the
world
is
all
wrong
and
my
mind
in
a
fog
aw
do
be
a
glug
said
the
little
red
dog
then
up
from
the
grass
where
he
sat
by
his
tree
the
voice
of
the
tinker
rose
fearless
and
free
the
little
dog
listened
his
head
on
one
side
then
sought
him
a
spot
where
a
bored
dog
could
hide
kettles
and
pans
ho
kettles
and
pans
the
stars
are
the
gods
but
the
earth
it
is
man
yet
down
in
the
shadow
dull
mortals
there
are
who
climb
in
the
to
snatch
at
a
star
seeking
content
and
a
surcease
of
care
finding
but
emptiness
everywhere
then
make
for
the
mountain
importunate
man
with
a
kettle
to
mend
and
your
emily
ann
as
he
cocked
a
sad
eye
a
sheltering
log
oh
a
glug
is
a
glug
sighed
the
little
red
dog
the
end
