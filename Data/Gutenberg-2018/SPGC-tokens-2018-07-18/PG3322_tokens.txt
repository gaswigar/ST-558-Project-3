the
lady
isabel
in
an
of
the
spacious
and
handsome
library
of
his
sat
william
earl
of
mount
severn
his
hair
was
gray
the
smoothness
of
his
expansive
brow
was
defaced
by
premature
wrinkles
and
his
once
attractive
face
bore
the
pale
unmistakable
look
of
dissipation
one
of
his
feet
was
cased
in
folds
of
linen
as
it
rested
on
the
soft
velvet
ottoman
speaking
of
gout
as
plainly
as
any
foot
ever
spoke
yet
it
would
seem
to
look
at
the
man
as
he
sat
there
that
he
had
grown
old
before
his
time
and
so
he
had
his
years
were
barely
nine
and
forty
yet
in
all
save
years
he
was
an
aged
man
a
noted
character
had
been
the
earl
of
mount
severn
not
that
he
had
been
a
renowned
politician
or
a
great
general
or
an
eminent
statesman
or
even
an
active
member
in
the
upper
house
not
for
any
of
these
had
the
earl
s
name
been
in
the
mouths
of
men
but
for
the
most
reckless
among
the
reckless
for
the
spendthrift
among
spendthrifts
for
the
gamester
above
all
gamesters
and
for
a
gay
man
outstripping
the
gay
by
these
characteristics
did
the
world
know
lord
mount
severn
it
was
said
his
faults
were
those
of
his
head
that
a
better
heart
or
a
more
generous
spirit
never
beat
in
human
form
and
there
was
much
truth
in
this
it
had
been
well
for
him
had
he
lived
and
died
plain
william
vane
up
to
his
five
and
twentieth
year
he
had
been
industrious
and
steady
had
kept
his
terms
in
the
temple
and
studied
late
and
early
the
sober
application
of
william
vane
had
been
a
by
word
with
the
embryo
barristers
around
judge
vane
they
ironically
called
him
and
they
strove
ineffectually
to
allure
him
away
to
idleness
and
pleasure
but
young
vane
was
ambitious
and
he
knew
that
on
his
own
talents
and
exertions
must
depend
his
own
rising
in
the
world
he
was
of
excellent
family
but
poor
counting
a
relative
in
the
old
earl
of
mount
severn
the
possibility
of
his
succeeding
to
the
earldom
never
occurred
to
him
for
three
healthy
lives
two
of
them
young
stood
between
him
and
the
title
yet
those
have
died
off
one
of
apoplexy
one
of
fever
in
africa
the
third
boating
at
oxford
and
the
young
temple
student
william
vane
suddenly
found
himself
earl
of
mount
severn
and
the
lawful
possessor
of
sixty
thousand
a
year
his
first
idea
was
that
he
should
never
be
able
to
spend
the
money
that
such
a
sum
year
by
year
could
not
be
spent
it
was
a
wonder
his
head
was
not
turned
by
adulation
at
the
onset
for
he
was
courted
flattered
and
caressed
by
all
classes
from
a
royal
duke
downward
he
became
the
most
attractive
man
of
his
day
the
lion
in
society
for
independent
of
his
wealth
and
title
he
was
of
distinguished
appearance
and
fascinating
manners
but
unfortunately
the
prudence
which
had
sustained
william
vane
the
poor
law
student
in
his
solitary
temple
chambers
entirely
forsook
william
vane
the
young
earl
of
mount
severn
and
he
commenced
his
career
on
a
scale
of
speed
so
great
that
all
staid
people
said
he
was
going
to
ruin
and
the
deuce
headlong
but
a
peer
of
the
realm
and
one
whose
is
sixty
thousand
per
annum
does
not
go
to
ruin
in
a
day
there
sat
the
earl
in
his
library
now
in
his
year
and
ruin
had
not
come
yet
that
is
it
had
not
overwhelmed
him
but
the
embarrassments
which
had
clung
to
him
and
been
the
destruction
of
his
tranquility
the
bane
of
his
existence
who
shall
describe
them
the
public
knew
them
pretty
well
his
private
friends
knew
better
his
creditors
best
but
none
save
himself
knew
or
could
ever
know
the
worrying
torment
that
was
his
portion
wellnigh
driving
him
to
distraction
years
ago
by
dint
of
looking
things
steadily
in
the
face
and
by
economizing
he
might
have
retrieved
his
position
but
he
had
done
what
most
people
do
in
such
cases
put
off
the
evil
day
sine
die
and
gone
on
increasing
his
enormous
list
of
debts
the
hour
of
exposure
and
ruin
was
now
advancing
fast
perhaps
the
earl
himself
was
thinking
so
as
he
sat
there
before
an
enormous
mass
of
papers
which
strewed
the
library
table
his
thoughts
were
back
in
the
past
that
was
a
foolish
match
of
his
that
gretna
green
match
for
love
foolish
so
far
as
prudence
went
but
the
countess
had
been
an
affectionate
wife
to
him
had
borne
with
his
follies
and
his
neglect
had
been
an
admirable
mother
to
their
only
child
one
child
alone
had
been
theirs
and
in
her
thirteenth
year
the
countess
had
died
if
they
had
but
been
blessed
with
a
son
the
earl
moaned
over
the
continued
disappointment
still
he
might
have
seen
a
way
out
of
his
difficulties
the
boy
as
soon
as
he
was
of
age
would
have
joined
with
him
in
cutting
off
the
entail
and
my
lord
said
a
servant
entering
the
room
and
interrupting
the
earl
s
castles
in
the
air
a
gentleman
is
asking
to
see
who
cried
the
earl
sharply
not
perceiving
the
card
the
man
was
bringing
no
unknown
person
although
wearing
the
externals
of
a
foreign
ambassador
was
ever
admitted
unceremoniously
to
the
presence
of
lord
mount
severn
years
of
duns
had
taught
the
servants
caution
his
card
is
here
my
lord
it
is
carlyle
of
west
mr
carlyle
of
west
lynne
groaned
the
earl
whose
foot
just
then
had
an
awful
twinge
what
does
he
want
show
him
the
servant
did
as
he
was
bid
and
introduced
carlyle
look
at
the
visitor
well
reader
for
he
will
play
his
part
in
this
history
he
was
a
very
tall
man
of
seven
and
twenty
of
remarkably
noble
presence
he
was
somewhat
given
to
stooping
his
head
when
he
spoke
to
any
one
shorter
than
himself
it
was
a
peculiar
habit
almost
to
be
called
a
bowing
habit
and
his
father
had
possessed
it
before
him
when
told
of
it
he
would
laugh
and
say
he
was
unconscious
of
doing
it
his
features
were
good
his
complexion
was
pale
and
clear
his
hair
dark
and
his
full
eyelids
drooped
over
his
deep
gray
eyes
altogether
it
was
a
countenance
that
both
men
and
women
liked
to
look
upon
the
index
of
an
honorable
sincere
nature
not
that
it
would
have
been
called
a
handsome
face
so
much
as
a
pleasing
and
a
distinguished
one
though
but
the
son
of
a
country
lawyer
and
destined
to
be
a
lawyer
himself
he
had
received
the
training
of
a
gentleman
had
been
educated
at
rugby
and
taken
his
degree
at
oxford
he
advanced
at
once
to
the
earl
in
the
straightforward
way
of
a
man
of
business
of
a
man
who
has
come
on
business
mr
carlyle
said
the
latter
holding
out
his
hand
he
was
always
deemed
the
most
affable
peer
of
the
age
i
am
happy
to
see
you
you
perceive
i
can
not
rise
at
least
without
great
pain
and
inconvenience
my
enemy
the
gout
has
possession
of
me
again
take
a
seat
are
you
staying
in
town
i
have
just
arrived
from
west
lynne
the
chief
object
of
my
journey
was
to
see
your
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
the
earl
uneasily
for
a
suspicion
had
crossed
his
mind
that
carlyle
might
be
acting
for
some
one
of
his
many
troublesome
creditors
carlyle
drew
his
chair
nearer
to
the
earl
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
a
rumor
came
to
my
ears
my
lord
that
east
lynne
was
in
the
a
moment
sir
exclaimed
the
earl
with
reserve
not
to
say
hauteur
in
his
tone
for
his
suspicions
were
gaining
ground
are
we
to
converse
confidentially
together
as
men
of
honor
or
is
there
something
concealed
behind
i
do
not
understand
you
said
carlyle
in
a
word
excuse
my
speaking
plainly
but
i
must
feel
my
ground
are
you
here
on
the
part
of
some
of
my
rascally
creditors
to
pump
information
out
of
me
that
otherwise
they
would
not
get
my
lord
uttered
the
visitor
i
should
be
incapable
of
so
dishonorable
an
action
i
know
that
a
lawyer
gets
credit
for
possessing
but
lax
notions
on
the
score
of
honor
but
you
can
scarcely
suspect
that
i
should
be
guilty
of
underhand
work
toward
you
i
never
was
guilty
of
a
mean
trick
in
my
life
to
my
recollection
and
i
do
not
think
i
ever
shall
pardon
me
carlyle
if
you
knew
half
the
tricks
and
ruses
played
upon
me
you
would
not
wonder
at
my
suspecting
all
the
world
proceed
with
your
i
heard
that
east
lynne
was
for
private
sale
your
agent
dropped
half
a
word
to
me
in
confidence
if
so
i
should
wish
to
be
the
for
whom
inquired
the
earl
you
laughed
the
earl
egad
lawyering
can
t
be
such
bad
work
nor
is
it
rejoined
carlyle
with
an
extensive
connection
such
as
ours
but
you
must
remember
that
a
good
fortune
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
and
a
large
one
by
my
i
know
the
proceeds
of
lawyering
not
altogether
my
mother
brought
a
fortune
on
her
marriage
and
it
enabled
my
father
to
speculate
successfully
i
have
been
looking
out
for
an
eligible
property
to
invest
my
money
upon
and
east
lynne
will
suit
me
well
provided
i
can
have
the
refusal
of
it
and
we
can
agree
about
the
lord
mount
severn
mused
for
a
few
moments
before
he
spoke
mr
carlyle
he
began
my
affairs
are
very
bad
and
ready
money
i
must
find
somewhere
now
east
lynne
is
not
entailed
neither
is
it
mortgaged
to
anything
like
its
value
though
the
latter
fact
as
you
may
imagine
is
not
patent
to
the
world
when
i
bought
it
at
a
bargain
eighteen
years
ago
you
were
the
lawyer
on
the
other
side
i
my
father
smiled
carlyle
i
was
a
child
at
the
of
course
i
ought
to
have
said
your
father
by
selling
east
lynne
a
few
thousands
will
come
into
my
hands
after
claims
on
it
are
settled
i
have
no
other
means
of
raising
the
wind
and
that
is
why
i
have
resolved
to
part
with
it
but
now
understand
if
it
were
known
abroad
that
east
lynne
is
going
from
me
i
should
have
a
hornet
s
nest
about
my
ears
so
that
it
must
be
disposed
of
privately
do
you
comprehend
perfectly
replied
carlyle
i
would
as
soon
you
bought
it
as
anyone
else
if
as
you
say
we
can
agree
about
what
does
your
lordship
expect
for
it
at
a
rough
estimate
for
particulars
i
must
refer
you
to
my
men
of
business
warburton
ware
not
less
than
seventy
thousand
too
much
my
lord
cried
carlyle
decisively
and
that
s
not
its
value
returned
the
earl
these
forced
sales
never
do
fetch
their
value
answered
the
speaking
lawyer
until
this
hint
was
given
me
by
beauchamp
i
had
thought
east
lynne
was
settled
upon
your
lordship
s
there
s
nothing
settled
on
her
rejoined
the
earl
the
contraction
on
his
brow
standing
out
more
plainly
that
comes
of
your
thoughtless
runaway
marriages
i
fell
in
love
with
general
conway
s
daughter
and
she
ran
away
with
me
like
a
fool
that
is
we
were
both
fools
together
for
our
pains
the
general
objected
to
me
and
said
i
must
sow
my
wild
oats
before
he
would
give
me
mary
so
i
took
her
to
gretna
green
and
she
became
countess
of
mount
severn
without
a
settlement
it
was
an
unfortunate
affair
taking
one
thing
with
another
when
her
elopement
was
made
known
to
the
general
it
killed
killed
him
interrupted
carlyle
it
did
he
had
disease
of
the
heart
and
the
excitement
brought
on
the
crisis
my
poor
wife
never
was
happy
from
that
hour
she
blamed
herself
for
her
father
s
death
and
i
believe
it
led
to
her
own
she
was
ill
for
years
the
doctors
called
it
consumption
but
it
was
more
like
a
wasting
insensibly
away
and
consumption
never
had
been
in
her
family
no
luck
ever
attends
runaway
marriages
i
have
noticed
it
since
in
many
many
instances
something
bad
is
sure
to
turn
up
from
there
might
have
been
a
settlement
executed
after
the
marriage
observed
carlyle
for
the
earl
had
stopped
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
i
know
there
might
but
there
was
not
my
wife
had
possessed
no
fortune
i
was
already
deep
in
my
career
of
extravagance
and
neither
of
us
thought
of
making
provision
for
our
future
children
or
if
we
thought
of
it
we
did
not
do
it
there
is
an
old
saying
carlyle
that
what
may
be
done
at
any
time
is
never
carlyle
bowed
so
my
child
is
portionless
resumed
the
earl
with
a
suppressed
sigh
the
thought
that
it
may
be
an
embarrassing
thing
for
her
were
i
to
die
before
she
is
settled
in
life
crosses
my
mind
when
i
am
in
a
serious
mood
that
she
will
marry
well
there
is
little
doubt
for
she
possesses
beauty
in
a
rare
degree
and
has
been
reared
as
an
english
girl
should
be
not
to
frivolity
and
foppery
she
was
trained
by
her
mother
who
save
for
the
mad
act
she
was
persuaded
into
by
me
was
all
goodness
and
refinement
for
the
first
twelve
years
of
her
life
and
since
then
by
an
admirable
governess
no
fear
that
she
will
be
decamping
to
gretna
she
was
a
very
lovely
child
observed
the
lawyer
i
remember
ay
you
have
seen
her
at
east
lynne
in
her
mother
s
lifetime
but
to
return
to
business
if
you
become
the
purchaser
of
the
east
lynne
estate
carlyle
it
must
be
under
the
rose
the
money
that
it
brings
after
paying
off
the
mortgage
i
must
have
as
i
tell
you
for
my
private
use
and
you
know
i
should
not
be
able
to
touch
a
farthing
of
it
if
the
confounded
public
got
an
inkling
of
the
transfer
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
proprietor
of
east
lynne
must
be
lord
mount
severn
at
least
for
some
little
time
afterwards
perhaps
you
will
not
object
to
carlyle
considered
before
replying
and
then
the
conversation
was
resumed
when
it
was
decided
that
he
should
see
warburton
and
ware
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
confer
with
them
it
was
growing
late
when
he
rose
to
leave
stay
and
dine
with
me
said
the
earl
carlyle
hesitated
and
looked
down
at
his
dress
a
plain
gentlemanly
morning
attire
but
certainly
not
a
dinner
costume
for
a
peer
s
table
oh
that
s
nothing
said
the
earl
we
shall
be
quite
alone
except
my
daughter
vane
of
castle
marling
is
staying
with
us
she
came
up
to
present
my
child
at
the
last
but
i
think
i
heard
something
about
her
dining
out
if
not
we
will
have
it
by
ourselves
here
oblige
me
by
touching
the
bell
the
servant
entered
inquire
whether
vane
dines
at
home
said
the
earl
mrs
vane
dines
out
my
lord
was
the
man
s
immediate

the
carriage
is
at
the
door
very
well
carlyle
at
seven
o
clock
the
dinner
was
announced
and
the
earl
wheeled
into
the
adjoining
room
as
he
and
carlyle
entered
it
at
one
door
some
one
else
came
in
by
the
opposite
one
who
what
was
it
carlyle
looked
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
a
human
being
he
almost
thought
it
more
like
an
angel
a
light
graceful
girlish
form
a
face
of
surpassing
beauty
beauty
that
is
rarely
seen
save
from
the
imagination
of
a
painter
dark
shining
curls
falling
on
her
neck
and
shoulders
smooth
as
a
child
s
fair
delicate
arms
decorated
with
pearls
and
a
flowing
dress
of
costly
white
lace
altogether
the
vision
did
indeed
look
to
the
lawyer
as
one
from
a
fairer
world
than
this
my
daughter
carlyle
the
lady
they
took
their
seats
at
the
table
lord
mount
severn
at
its
head
in
spite
of
his
gout
and
his
footstool
and
the
young
lady
and
carlyle
opposite
each
other
carlyle
had
not
deemed
himself
a
particular
admirer
of
women
s
beauty
but
the
extraordinary
loveliness
of
the
young
girl
before
him
nearly
took
away
his
senses
and
his
yet
it
was
not
so
much
the
perfect
contour
or
the
exquisite
features
that
struck
him
or
the
rich
damask
of
the
delicate
cheek
or
the
luxuriant
falling
hair
no
it
was
the
sweet
expression
of
the
soft
dark
eyes
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
eyes
so
pleasing
he
could
not
keep
his
gaze
from
her
and
he
became
conscious
as
he
grew
more
familiar
with
her
face
that
there
was
in
its
character
a
sad
sorrowful
look
only
at
times
was
it
to
be
noticed
when
the
features
were
at
repose
and
it
lay
chiefly
in
the
very
eyes
he
was
admiring
never
does
this
unconsciously
mournful
expression
exist
but
it
is
a
sure
index
of
sorrow
and
suffering
but
carlyle
understood
it
not
and
who
could
connect
sorrow
with
the
anticipated
brilliant
future
of
isabel
vane
isabel
observed
the
earl
you
are
yes
papa
not
to
keep
old
levison
waiting
tea
she
likes
to
take
it
early
and
i
know
vane
must
have
kept
her
waiting
dinner
it
was
six
when
she
drove
from
i
hope
you
will
not
be
late
it
depends
upon
then
i
am
sure
you
will
be
when
the
young
ladies
in
this
fashionable
world
of
ours
turn
night
into
day
it
is
a
bad
thing
for
their
roses
what
say
you
carlyle
carlyle
glanced
at
the
roses
on
the
cheeks
opposite
to
him
they
looked
too
fresh
and
bright
to
fade
lightly
at
the
conclusion
of
dinner
a
maid
entered
the
room
with
a
white
cashmere
mantle
placing
it
over
the
shoulders
of
her
young
lady
as
she
said
the
carriage
was
waiting
lady
isabel
advanced
to
the
earl
my
love
he
answered
drawing
her
toward
him
and
kissing
her
sweet
face
tell
vane
i
will
not
have
you
kept
out
till
morning
hours
you
are
but
a
child
yet
carlyle
will
you
ring
i
am
debarred
from
seeing
my
daughter
to
the
if
your
lordship
will
allow
me
if
lady
isabel
will
pardon
the
attendance
of
one
little
used
to
wait
upon
young
ladies
i
shall
be
proud
to
see
her
to
her
carriage
was
the
somewhat
confused
answer
of
carlyle
as
he
touched
the
bell
the
earl
thanked
him
and
the
young
lady
smiled
and
carlyle
conducted
her
down
the
broad
lighted
staircase
and
stood
bareheaded
by
the
door
of
the
luxurious
chariot
and
handed
her
in
she
put
out
her
hand
in
her
frank
pleasant
manner
as
she
wished
him
good
night
the
carriage
rolled
on
its
way
and
carlyle
returned
to
the
earl
well
is
she
not
a
handsome
girl
he
demanded
handsome
is
not
the
word
for
beauty
such
as
hers
was
carlyle
s
reply
in
a
low
warm
tone
i
never
saw
a
face
half
so
she
caused
quite
a
sensation
at
the
last
week
as
i
hear
this
everlasting
gout
kept
me
indoors
all
day
and
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
the
earl
was
not
partial
lady
isabel
was
wondrously
gifted
by
nature
not
only
in
mind
and
person
but
in
heart
she
was
as
little
like
a
fashionable
young
lady
as
it
was
well
possible
to
be
partly
because
she
had
hitherto
been
secluded
from
the
great
world
partly
from
the
care
bestowed
upon
her
training
during
the
lifetime
of
her
mother
she
had
lived
occasionally
at
east
lynne
but
mostly
at
a
larger
seat
of
the
earl
s
in
wales
mount
severn
since
her
mother
s
death
she
had
remained
entirely
at
mount
severn
under
the
charge
of
a
judicious
governess
a
very
small
establishment
being
kept
for
them
and
the
earl
paying
them
impromptu
and
flying
visits
generous
and
benevolent
she
was
timid
and
sensitive
to
a
degree
gentle
and
considerate
to
all
do
not
cavil
at
her
being
thus
praised
admire
and
love
her
whilst
you
may
she
is
worthy
of
it
now
in
her
innocent
girlhood
the
time
will
come
when
such
praise
would
be
misplaced
could
the
fate
that
was
to
overtake
his
child
have
been
foreseen
by
the
earl
he
would
have
struck
her
down
to
death
in
his
love
as
she
stood
before
him
rather
than
suffer
her
to
enter
upon
it
chapter
ii
the
broken
cross
lady
isabel
s
carriage
continued
its
way
and
deposited
her
at
the
residence
of
levison
levison
was
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
and
very
severe
in
speech
and
manner
or
as
vane
expressed
it
she
looked
the
image
of
impatience
when
isabel
entered
with
her
cap
pushed
all
awry
and
pulling
at
the
black
satin
gown
for
vane
had
kept
her
waiting
dinner
and
isabel
was
keeping
her
from
her
tea
and
that
does
not
agree
with
the
aged
with
their
health
or
with
their
temper
i
fear
i
am
late
exclaimed
lady
isabel
as
she
advanced
to
levison
but
a
gentleman
dined
with
papa
and
it
made
us
rather
longer
at
you
are
minutes
behind
your
time
cried
the
old
lady
sharply
and
i
want
my
tea
emma
order
it
vane
rang
the
bell
and
did
as
she
was
bid
she
was
a
little
woman
of
very
plain
in
face
but
elegant
in
figure
very
accomplished
and
vain
to
her
fingers
ends
her
mother
who
was
dead
had
been
levison
s
daughter
and
her
husband
raymond
vane
was
presumptive
heir
to
the
earldom
of
mount
severn
won
t
you
take
that
tippet
off
child
asked
levison
who
knew
nothing
of
the
names
for
such
articles
mantles
burnous
and
all
the
string
of
them
and
isabel
threw
it
off
and
sat
down
by
her
the
tea
is
not
made
grandmamma
exclaimed
vane
in
an
accent
of
astonishment
as
the
servant
appeared
with
the
tray
and
the
silver
urn
you
surely
do
not
have
it
made
in
the
where
should
i
have
it
made
inquired
levison
it
is
much
more
convenient
to
have
it
brought
in
ready
made
said
vane
i
dislike
the
embarass
of
making
indeed
was
the
reply
of
the
old
lady
and
get
it
slopped
over
in
the
saucers
and
as
cold
as
milk
you
always
were
lazy
emma
and
given
to
use
those
french
words
i
d
rather
stick
a
printed
label
on
my
forehead
for
my
part
i
speak
french
and
let
the
world
know
it
in
that
who
makes
tea
for
you
in
general
asked
vane
telegraphing
a
contemptuous
glance
to
isabel
behind
her
grandmother
but
the
eyes
of
lady
isabel
fell
timidly
and
a
blush
rose
to
her
cheeks
she
did
not
like
to
appear
to
differ
from
vane
her
senior
and
her
father
s
guest
but
her
mind
revolted
at
the
bare
idea
of
ingratitude
or
ridicule
cast
on
an
aged
parent
harriet
comes
in
and
makes
it
for
me
replied
levison
aye
and
sits
down
and
takes
it
with
me
when
i
am
alone
which
is
pretty
often
what
do
you
say
to
that
madame
emma
you
with
your
fine
notions
just
as
you
please
of
course
and
there
s
the
at
your
elbow
and
the
urn
s
fizzing
away
and
if
we
are
to
have
any
tea
it
had
better
be
i
don
t
know
how
much
to
put
in
grumbled
vane
who
had
the
greatest
horror
of
soiling
her
hands
or
her
gloves
who
in
short
had
a
particular
antipathy
to
doing
anything
useful
shall
i
make
it
dear
levison
said
isabel
rising
with
alacrity
i
had
used
to
make
it
quite
as
often
as
my
governess
at
mount
severn
and
i
make
it
for
do
child
replied
the
old
lady
you
are
worth
ten
of
isabel
laughed
merrily
drew
off
her
gloves
and
sat
down
to
the
table
and
at
that
moment
a
young
and
elegant
man
lounged
into
the
room
he
was
deemed
handsome
with
his
features
his
dark
eyes
his
raven
hair
and
his
white
teeth
but
to
a
keen
observer
those
features
had
not
an
attractive
expression
and
the
dark
eyes
had
a
great
knack
of
looking
away
while
he
spoke
to
you
it
was
francis
captain
levison
he
was
grandson
to
the
old
lady
and
first
cousin
to
vane
few
men
were
so
fascinating
in
manners
at
times
and
seasons
in
face
and
in
form
few
men
won
so
completely
upon
their
hearers
ears
and
few
were
so
heartless
in
their
hearts
of
hearts
the
world
courted
him
and
society
honored
him
for
though
he
was
a
graceless
spendthrift
and
it
was
known
that
he
was
he
was
the
presumptive
heir
to
the
old
and
rich
sir
peter
levison
the
ancient
lady
spoke
up
captain
levison
lady
isabel
they
both
acknowledged
the
introduction
and
isabel
a
child
yet
in
the
ways
of
the
world
flushed
crimson
at
the
admiring
looks
cast
upon
her
by
the
young
guardsman
strange
strange
that
she
should
make
the
acquaintance
of
these
two
men
in
the
same
day
almost
in
the
same
hour
the
two
of
all
the
human
race
who
were
to
exercise
so
powerful
an
influence
over
her
future
life
that
s
a
pretty
cross
child
cried
levison
as
isabel
stood
by
her
when
tea
was
over
and
she
and
vane
were
about
to
depart
on
their
evening
visit
she
alluded
to
a
golden
cross
set
with
seven
emeralds
which
isabel
wore
on
her
neck
it
was
of
light
delicate
texture
and
was
suspended
from
a
thin
short
gold
chain
is
it
not
pretty
answered
isabel
it
was
given
me
by
my
dear
mamma
just
before
she
died
stay
i
will
take
it
off
for
you
i
only
wear
it
upon
great
this
her
first
appearance
at
the
grand
duke
s
seemed
a
very
great
occasion
to
the
and
inexperienced
girl
she
unclasped
the
chain
and
placed
it
with
the
cross
in
the
hands
of
levison
why
i
declare
you
have
nothing
on
but
that
cross
and
some
rubbishing
pearl
bracelets
uttered
vane
to
isabel
i
did
not
look
at
you
mamma
gave
me
both
the
bracelets
are
those
she
used
frequently
to
you
child
because
your
mamma
wore
those
bracelets
years
ago
is
that
a
reason
for
your
doing
so
retorted
vane
why
did
you
not
put
on
your
diamonds
i
did
put
on
my
diamonds
but
i
took
them
off
again
stammered
isabel
what
on
earth
for
i
did
not
like
to
look
too
fine
answered
isabel
with
a
laugh
and
a
blush
they
glittered
so
i
feared
it
might
be
thought
i
had
put
them
on
to
look
ah
i
see
you
mean
to
set
up
in
that
class
of
people
who
pretend
to
despise
ornaments
scornfully
remarked
vane
it
is
the
refinement
of
affectation
lady
the
sneer
fell
harmlessly
on
lady
isabel
s
ear
she
only
believed
something
had
put
vane
out
of
temper
it
certainly
had
and
that
something
though
isabel
little
suspected
it
was
the
evident
admiration
captain
levison
evinced
for
her
fresh
young
beauty
it
quite
absorbed
him
and
rendered
him
neglectful
even
of
vane
here
child
take
your
cross
said
the
old
lady
it
is
very
pretty
prettier
on
your
neck
than
diamonds
would
be
you
don
t
want
embellishing
never
mind
what
emma
francis
levison
took
the
cross
and
chain
from
her
hand
to
pass
them
to
lady
isabel
whether
he
was
awkward
or
whether
her
hands
were
full
for
she
held
her
gloves
her
handkerchief
and
had
just
taken
up
her
mantle
certain
it
is
that
it
fell
and
the
gentleman
in
his
too
quick
effort
to
regain
it
managed
to
set
his
foot
upon
it
and
the
cross
was
broken
in
two
there
now
whose
fault
was
that
cried
levison
isabel
did
not
answer
her
heart
was
very
full
she
took
the
broken
cross
and
the
tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
she
could
not
help
it
why
you
are
never
crying
over
a
stupid
bauble
of
a
cross
uttered
vane
interrupting
captain
levison
s
expression
of
regret
at
his
awkwardness
you
can
have
it
mended
dear
interposed
levison
lady
isabel
chased
away
the
tears
and
turned
to
captain
levison
with
a
cheerful
look
pray
do
not
blame
yourself
she
said
the
fault
was
as
much
mine
as
yours
and
as
levison
says
i
can
get
it
she
disengaged
the
upper
part
of
the
cross
from
the
chain
as
she
spoke
and
clasped
the
latter
round
her
throat
you
will
not
go
with
that
thin
string
of
gold
on
and
nothing
else
uttered
vane
why
not
returned
isabel
if
people
say
anything
i
can
tell
them
an
accident
happened
to
the
vane
burst
into
a
laugh
of
mocking
ridicule
if
people
say
anything
she
repeated
in
a
tone
according
with
the
laugh
they
are
not
likely
to
say
anything
but
they
will
deem
lord
mount
severn
s
daughter
unfortunately
short
of
isabel
smiled
and
shook
her
head
they
saw
my
diamonds
at
the
if
you
had
done
such
an
awkward
thing
for
me
frank
levison
burst
forth
the
old
lady
my
doors
should
have
been
closed
against
you
for
a
month
there
if
you
are
to
go
emma
you
had
better
go
dancing
off
to
begin
an
evening
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
in
my
time
we
used
to
go
at
seven
but
it
s
the
custom
now
to
turn
night
into
when
george
the
third
dined
at
one
o
clock
upon
boiled
mutton
and
turnips
put
in
the
graceless
captain
who
certainly
held
his
grandmother
in
no
greater
reverence
than
did
vane
he
turned
to
isabel
as
he
spoke
to
hand
her
downstairs
thus
she
was
conducted
to
her
carriage
the
second
time
that
night
by
a
stranger
vane
got
down
by
herself
as
she
best
could
and
her
temper
was
not
improved
by
the
process
said
she
to
the
captain
i
shall
not
say
you
will
find
me
there
almost
as
soon
as
you
told
me
you
were
not
coming
some
bachelor
s
party
in
the
yes
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
farewell
for
the
present
lady
what
an
object
you
will
look
with
nothing
on
your
neck
but
a
schoolgirl
s
chain
began
vane
returning
to
the
grievance
as
the
carriage
drove
on
oh
vane
what
does
it
signify
i
can
only
think
of
my
broken
cross
i
am
sure
it
must
be
an
evil
an
evil
what
an
evil
omen
mamma
gave
me
that
cross
when
she
was
dying
she
told
me
to
let
it
be
to
me
as
a
talisman
always
to
keep
it
safely
and
when
i
was
in
any
distress
or
in
need
of
counsel
to
look
at
it
and
strive
to
recall
what
her
advice
would
be
and
to
act
accordingly
and
now
it
is
broken
broken
a
glaring
gaslight
flashed
into
the
carriage
right
into
the
face
of
isabel
i
declare
uttered
vane
you
are
crying
again
i
tell
you
what
it
is
isabel
i
am
not
going
to
chaperone
red
eyes
to
the
duchess
of
dartford
s
so
if
you
can
t
put
a
stop
to
this
i
shall
order
the
carriage
home
and
go
on
isabel
meekly
dried
her
eyes
sighing
deeply
as
she
did
so
i
can
have
the
pieces
joined
i
dare
say
but
it
will
never
be
the
same
cross
to
me
what
have
you
done
with
the
pieces
irascibly
asked
vane
i
folded
them
in
the
thin
paper
levison
gave
me
and
put
it
inside
my
frock
here
it
is
touching
the
body
i
have
no
pocket
vane
gave
vent
to
a
groan
she
never
had
been
a
girl
herself
she
had
been
a
woman
at
ten
and
she
complimented
isabel
upon
being
little
better
than
an
imbecile
put
it
inside
my
frock
she
uttered
in
a
torrent
of
scorn
and
you
eighteen
years
of
age
i
fancied
you
left
off
frocks
when
you
left
the
nursery
for
shame
isabel
i
meant
to
say
my
dress
corrected
isabel
meant
to
say
you
are
a
baby
idiot
was
the
inward
comment
of
vane
a
few
minutes
and
isabel
forgot
her
grievance
the
brilliant
rooms
were
to
her
as
an
enchanting
scene
of
dreamland
for
her
heart
was
in
its
springtide
of
early
freshness
and
the
satiety
of
experience
had
not
come
how
could
she
remember
trouble
even
the
broken
cross
as
she
bent
to
the
homage
offered
her
and
drank
in
the
honeyed
words
poured
forth
into
her
ear
halloo
cried
an
oxford
student
with
a
long
in
prospective
who
was
screwing
himself
against
the
wall
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
waltzers
i
thought
you
had
given
up
coming
to
these
places
so
i
had
replied
the
fast
nobleman
addressed
the
son
of
a
marquis
but
i
am
on
the
lookout
so
am
forced
into
them
again
i
think
a
room
the
greatest
bore
in
on
the
lookout
for
what
for
a
wife
my
governor
has
stopped
supplies
and
has
vowed
by
his
beard
not
to
advance
another
shilling
or
pay
a
debt
till
i
reform
as
a
preliminary
step
toward
it
he
insists
upon
a
wife
and
i
am
trying
to
choose
one
for
i
am
deeper
in
debt
than
you
take
the
new
beauty
who
is
she
lady
isabel
much
obliged
for
the
suggestion
replied
the
earl
but
one
likes
a
respectable
and
mount
severn
is
going
to
smash
he
and
i
are
too
much
in
the
same
line
and
might
clash
in
the
long
one
can
t
have
everything
the
girl
s
beauty
is
beyond
common
i
saw
that
rake
levison
make
up
to
her
he
fancies
he
can
carry
all
before
him
where
women
are
so
he
does
often
was
his
quiet
reply
i
hate
the
fellow
he
thinks
so
much
of
himself
with
his
curled
hair
and
shining
teeth
and
his
white
skin
and
he
s
as
heartless
as
an
owl
what
was
that
business
about
miss
charteris
who
s
to
know
levison
slipped
out
of
the
escapade
like
an
eel
and
the
woman
protested
that
he
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
fourths
of
the
world
believed
and
she
went
abroad
and
died
and
levison
here
he
comes
and
mount
severn
s
daughter
with
they
were
approaching
at
that
moment
francis
levison
and
lady
isabel
he
was
expressing
his
regret
at
the
untoward
accident
of
the
cross
for
the
tenth
time
that
night
i
feel
that
it
can
never
be
atoned
for
whispered
he
that
the
heartfelt
homage
of
my
whole
life
would
not
be
sufficient
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
thrilling
gentleness
gratifying
to
the
ear
but
dangerous
to
the
heart
lady
isabel
glanced
up
and
caught
his
eyes
gazing
upon
her
with
the
deepest
tenderness
a
language
hers
had
never
yet
encountered
a
vivid
blush
again
arose
to
her
cheek
her
eyelids
fell
and
her
timid
words
died
away
in
silence
take
care
take
care
my
young
lady
isabel
murmured
the
oxonian
under
his
breath
as
they
passed
him
that
man
is
as
false
as
he
is
i
think
he
is
a
rascal
remarked
the
earl
i
know
he
is
i
know
a
thing
or
two
about
him
he
would
ruin
her
heart
for
the
renown
of
the
exploit
because
she
s
a
beauty
and
then
fling
it
away
broken
he
has
none
to
give
in
return
for
the
just
as
much
as
my
new
has
concluded
the
earl

is

barbara
hare
west
lynne
was
a
town
of
some
importance
particularly
in
its
own
eyes
though
being
neither
a
manufacturing
one
nor
a
cathedral
one
nor
even
the
chief
town
of
the
county
it
was
somewhat
primitive
in
its
manners
and
customs
passing
out
at
the
town
toward
the
east
you
came
upon
several
detached
gentleman
s
houses
in
the
vicinity
of
which
stood
the
church
of
jude
which
was
more
aristocratic
in
the
matter
of
its
congregation
than
the
other
churches
of
west
lynne
for
about
a
mile
these
houses
were
scattered
the
church
being
situated
at
their
commencement
close
to
that
busy
part
of
the
place
and
about
a
mile
further
on
you
came
upon
the
beautiful
estate
which
was
called
east
lynne
between
the
gentlemen
s
houses
mentioned
and
east
lynne
the
mile
of
road
was
very
solitary
being
much
overshadowed
with
trees
one
house
alone
stood
there
and
that
was
about
of
a
mile
before
you
came
to
east
lynne
it
was
on
the
left
hand
side
a
square
ugly
red
brick
house
with
a
weathercock
on
the
top
standing
some
little
distance
from
the
road
a
flat
lawn
extended
before
it
and
close
to
the
palings
which
divided
it
from
the
road
was
a
grove
of
trees
some
yards
in
depth
the
lawn
was
divided
by
a
narrow
middle
gravel
path
to
which
you
gained
access
from
the
portico
of
the
house
you
entered
upon
a
large
flagged
hall
with
a
reception
room
on
either
hand
and
the
staircase
a
wide
one
facing
you
by
the
side
of
the
staircase
you
passed
on
to
the
servants
apartments
and
offices
that
place
was
called
the
grove
and
was
the
property
and
residence
of
richard
hare
commonly
called
justice
hare
the
room
to
the
left
hand
as
you
went
in
was
the
general
the
other
was
very
much
kept
boxed
up
in
lavender
and
brown
holland
to
be
opened
on
state
occasions
justice
and
hare
had
three
children
a
son
and
two
daughters
anne
was
the
elder
of
the
girls
and
had
married
young
barbara
the
younger
was
now
nineteen
and
richard
the
eldest
but
we
shall
come
to
him
hereafter
in
this
on
a
chilly
evening
early
in
may
a
few
days
subsequent
to
that
which
had
witnessed
the
visit
of
carlyle
to
the
earl
of
mount
severn
sat
hare
a
pale
delicate
woman
buried
in
shawls
and
cushions
but
the
day
had
been
warm
at
the
window
sat
a
pretty
girl
very
fair
with
blue
eyes
light
hair
a
bright
complexion
and
small
aquiline
features
she
was
listlessly
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
book
barbara
i
am
sure
it
must
be
the
time
seems
to
move
slowly
with
you
mamma
it
is
scarcely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
i
told
you
it
was
but
ten
minutes
past
i
am
so
thirsty
announced
the
poor
invalid
do
go
and
look
at
the
clock
again
barbara
hare
rose
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
not
suppressed
opened
the
door
and
glanced
at
the
large
clock
in
the
hall
it
wants
nine
and
twenty
minutes
to
seven
mamma
i
wish
you
would
put
your
watch
on
of
a
day
four
times
you
have
sent
me
to
look
at
that
clock
since
i
am
so
thirsty
repeated
hare
with
a
sort
of
sob
if
seven
o
clock
would
but
strike
i
am
dying
for
my
it
may
occur
to
the
reader
that
a
lady
in
her
own
house
dying
for
her
tea
might
surely
order
it
brought
in
although
the
customary
hour
had
not
struck
not
so
hare
since
her
husband
had
first
brought
her
home
to
that
house
four
and
ago
she
had
never
dared
to
express
a
will
in
it
scarcely
on
her
own
responsibility
to
give
an
order
justice
hare
was
stern
imperative
obstinate
and
conceited
she
timid
gentle
and
submissive
she
had
loved
him
with
all
her
heart
and
her
life
had
been
one
long
yielding
of
her
will
to
his
in
fact
she
had
no
will
his
was
all
in
all
far
was
she
from
feeling
the
servitude
a
yoke
some
natures
do
not
and
to
do
hare
justice
his
powerful
will
that
must
bear
down
all
before
it
was
in
fault
not
his
kindness
he
never
meant
to
be
unkind
to
his
wife
of
his
three
children
barbara
alone
had
inherited
his
will
barbara
began
hare
again
when
she
thought
another
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
must
have
elapsed
well
mamma
ring
and
tell
them
to
be
getting
it
in
readiness
so
that
when
seven
strikes
there
may
be
no
goodness
mamma
you
know
they
do
always
have
it
ready
and
there
s
no
such
hurry
for
papa
may
not
be
at
but
she
rose
and
rang
the
bell
with
a
petulant
motion
and
when
the
man
answered
it
told
him
to
have
tea
in
to
its
time
if
you
knew
dear
how
dry
my
throat
is
how
parched
my
mouth
you
would
have
more
patience
with
barbara
closed
her
book
with
a
listless
air
and
turned
listlessly
to
the
window
she
seemed
tired
not
with
fatigue
but
with
what
the
french
express
by
the
word
ennui
here
comes
papa
she
presently
said
oh
i
am
so
glad
cried
poor
hare
perhaps
he
will
not
mind
having
the
tea
in
at
once
if
i
told
him
how
thirsty
i
the
justice
came
in
a
middle
sized
man
with
pompous
features
and
a
pompous
walk
and
a
flaxen
wig
in
his
aquiline
nose
compressed
lips
and
pointed
chin
might
be
traced
a
resemblance
to
his
daughter
though
he
never
could
have
been
half
so
as
was
pretty
barbara
richard
spoke
up
hare
from
between
her
shawls
the
instant
he
opened
the
door
well
would
you
please
let
me
have
tea
in
now
would
you
very
much
mind
taking
it
a
little
earlier
this
evening
i
am
feverish
again
and
my
tongue
is
so
parched
i
don
t
know
how
to
oh
it
s
near
seven
you
won
t
have
long
to
with
this
exceedingly
gracious
answer
to
an
invalid
s
request
hare
quitted
the
room
again
and
banged
the
door
he
had
not
spoken
unkindly
or
roughly
simply
with
indifference
but
ere
hare
s
meek
sigh
of
disappointment
was
over
the
door
and
the
flaxen
wig
was
thrust
in
again
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
have
it
now
it
will
be
a
fine
moonlight
night
and
i
am
going
with
pinner
as
far
as
beauchamp
s
to
smoke
a
pipe
order
it
in
the
tea
was
made
and
partaken
of
and
the
justice
departed
for
beauchamp
s
squire
pinner
calling
for
him
at
the
gate
beauchamp
was
a
gentleman
who
farmed
a
great
deal
of
land
and
who
was
also
lord
mount
severn
s
agent
or
steward
for
east
lynne
he
lived
higher
up
the
road
some
little
distance
beyond
east
lynne
i
am
so
cold
barbara
shivered
hare
as
she
watched
the
justice
down
the
gravel
path
i
wonder
if
your
papa
would
say
it
was
foolish
of
me
if
i
told
them
to
light
a
bit
of
fire
have
it
lighted
if
you
like
responded
barbara
ringing
the
bell
papa
will
know
nothing
about
it
one
way
or
the
other
for
he
won
t
be
home
till
after
bedtime
jasper
mamma
is
cold
and
would
like
a
fire
plenty
of
sticks
jasper
that
it
may
burn
up
quickly
said
hare
in
a
pleading
voice
as
if
the
sticks
were
jasper
s
and
not
hers
hare
got
her
fire
and
she
drew
her
chair
in
front
and
put
her
feet
on
the
fender
to
catch
its
warmth
barbara
listless
still
went
into
the
hall
took
a
woolen
shawl
from
the
stand
there
threw
it
over
her
shoulders
and
went
out
she
strolled
down
the
straight
formal
path
and
stood
at
the
iron
gate
looking
over
it
into
the
public
road
not
very
public
in
that
spot
and
at
that
hour
but
as
lonely
as
one
could
wish
the
night
was
calm
and
pleasant
though
somewhat
chilly
for
the
beginning
of
may
and
the
moon
was
getting
high
in
the
sky
when
will
he
come
home
she
murmured
as
she
leaned
her
head
upon
the
gate
oh
what
would
life
be
like
without
him
how
miserable
these
few
days
have
been
i
wonder
what
took
him
there
i
wonder
what
is
detaining
him
corny
said
he
was
only
gone
for
a
the
faint
echo
of
footsteps
in
the
distance
stole
upon
her
ear
and
barbara
drew
a
little
back
and
hid
herself
under
the
shelter
of
the
trees
not
choosing
to
be
seen
by
any
stray
but
as
they
drew
near
a
sudden
change
came
over
her
her
eyes
lighted
up
her
cheeks
were
dyed
with
crimson
and
her
veins
tingled
with
excess
of
rapture
for
she
knew
those
footsteps
and
loved
them
only
too
well
cautiously
peeping
over
the
gate
again
she
looked
down
the
road
a
tall
form
whose
very
height
and
strength
bore
a
grace
of
which
its
owner
was
unconscious
was
advancing
rapidly
toward
her
from
the
direction
of
west
lynne
again
she
shrank
away
true
love
is
ever
timid
and
whatever
may
have
been
barbara
hare
s
other
qualities
her
love
at
least
was
true
and
deep
but
instead
of
the
gate
opening
with
the
firm
quick
motion
peculiar
to
the
hand
which
guided
it
the
footsteps
seemed
to
pass
and
not
to
have
turned
at
all
toward
it
barbara
s
heart
sank
and
she
stole
to
the
gate
again
and
looked
out
with
a
yearning
look
yes
sure
enough
he
was
striding
on
not
thinking
of
her
not
coming
to
her
and
she
in
the
disappointment
and
impulse
of
the
moment
called
to
him
archibald
carlyle
it
was
no
other
turned
on
his
heel
and
approached
the
gate
is
it
you
barbara
watching
for
thieves
and
poachers
how
are
you
how
are
you
she
returned
holding
the
gate
open
for
him
to
enter
as
he
shook
hands
and
striving
to
calm
down
her
agitation
when
did
you
return
only
now
by
the
eight
o
clock
train
which
got
in
beyond
its
time
having
drawled
unpardonably
at
the
stations
they
little
thought
they
had
me
in
it
as
their
looks
betrayed
when
i
got
out
i
have
not
been
home
no
what
will
cornelia
say
i
went
to
the
office
for
five
minutes
but
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
beauchamp
and
am
going
up
at
once
thank
you
i
can
not
come
in
now
i
intend
to
do
so
on
my
papa
has
gone
up
to
beauchamp
mr
hare
has
he
he
and
squire
pinner
continued
barbara
they
have
gone
to
have
a
smoking
bout
and
if
you
wait
there
with
papa
it
will
be
too
late
to
come
in
for
he
is
sure
not
to
be
home
before
eleven
or
carlyle
bent
his
head
in
deliberation
then
i
think
it
is
of
little
use
my
going
on
said
he
for
my
business
with
beauchamp
is
private
i
must
defer
it
until
he
took
the
gate
out
of
her
hand
closed
it
and
placed
the
hand
within
his
own
arm
to
walk
with
her
to
the
house
it
was
done
in
a
fact
real
sort
of
way
nothing
of
romance
or
sentiment
hallowed
it
but
barbara
hare
felt
that
she
was
in
eden
and
how
have
you
all
been
barbara
these
few
days
oh
very
well
what
made
you
start
off
so
suddenly
you
never
said
you
were
going
or
came
to
wish
us
you
have
just
expressed
it
barbara
a
matter
of
business
suddenly
arose
and
i
suddenly
went
upon
cornelia
said
you
were
only
gone
for
a
did
she
when
in
london
i
find
so
many
things
to
do
is
hare
better
just
the
same
i
think
mamma
s
ailments
are
fancies
half
of
them
if
she
would
rouse
herself
she
would
be
better
what
is
in
that
parcel
you
are
not
to
inquire
miss
barbara
it
does
not
concern
you
it
only
concerns
is
it
something
you
have
brought
for
mamma
archibald
of
course
a
countryman
s
visit
to
london
entails
buying
presents
for
his
friends
at
least
it
used
to
be
so
in
the
when
people
made
their
wills
before
starting
and
were
a
fortnight
doing
the
journey
in
a
wagon
laughed
barbara
grandpapa
used
to
tell
us
tales
of
that
when
we
were
children
but
is
it
really
something
for
mamma
don
t
i
tell
you
so
i
have
brought
something
for
oh
what
is
it
she
uttered
her
color
rising
and
wondering
whether
he
was
in
jest
or
earnest
there
s
an
impatient
girl
what
is
it
wait
a
moment
and
you
shall
see
what
it
he
put
the
parcel
or
roll
he
was
carrying
upon
a
garden
chair
and
proceeded
to
search
his
pockets
every
pocket
was
visited
apparently
in
vain
barbara
i
think
it
is
gone
i
must
have
lost
it
her
heart
beat
as
she
stood
there
silently
looking
up
at
him
in
the
moonlight
was
it
lost
what
had
it
been
but
upon
a
second
search
he
came
upon
something
in
the
pocket
of
his
here
it
is
i
believe
what
brought
it
there
he
opened
a
small
box
and
taking
out
a
long
gold
chain
threw
it
around
her
neck
a
locket
was
attached
to
it
her
cheeks
crimson
went
and
came
her
heart
beat
more
rapidly
she
could
not
speak
a
word
of
thanks
and
carlyle
took
up
the
roll
and
walked
on
into
the
presence
of
hare
barbara
followed
in
a
few
minutes
her
mother
was
standing
up
watching
with
pleased
expectation
the
movements
of
carlyle
no
candles
were
in
the
room
but
it
was
bright
with
firelight
now
don
t
laugh
at
me
quoth
he
untying
the
string
of
the
parcel
it
is
not
a
roll
of
velvet
for
a
dress
and
it
is
not
a
roll
of
parchment
conferring
twenty
thousand
pounds
a
year
but
it
is
an
air
cushion
it
was
what
poor
hare
so
worn
with
sitting
and
lying
had
often
longed
for
she
had
heard
such
a
luxury
was
to
be
bought
in
london
but
never
remembered
to
have
seen
one
she
took
it
almost
with
a
greedy
hand
casting
a
grateful
look
at
carlyle
how
am
i
to
thank
you
for
it
she
murmured
through
her
tears
if
you
thank
me
at
all
i
will
never
bring
you
anything
again
cried
he
gaily
i
have
been
telling
barbara
that
a
visit
to
london
entails
bringing
gifts
for
friends
he
continued
do
you
see
how
smart
i
have
made
her
barbara
hastily
took
off
the
chain
and
laid
it
before
her
mother
what
a
beautiful
chain
muttered
hare
in
surprise
archibald
you
are
too
good
too
generous
this
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
this
is
beyond
a
nonsense
laughed
carlyle
i
ll
tell
you
both
how
i
happened
to
buy
it
i
went
into
a
jeweller
s
about
my
watch
which
has
taken
to
lose
lately
in
a
most
unceremonious
fashion
and
there
i
saw
a
whole
display
of
chains
hanging
up
some
ponderous
enough
for
a
sheriff
some
light
and
elegant
enough
for
barbara
i
dislike
to
see
a
thick
chain
on
a
lady
s
neck
they
put
me
in
mind
of
the
chain
she
lost
the
day
she
and
cornelia
went
with
me
to
lynchborough
which
loss
barbara
persisted
in
declaring
was
my
fault
for
dragging
her
through
the
town
while
cornelia
did
her
shopping
for
it
was
then
the
chain
was
but
i
was
only
joking
when
i
said
so
was
the
interruption
of
barbara
of
course
it
would
have
happened
had
you
not
been
with
me
the
links
were
always
well
these
chains
in
the
shop
in
london
put
me
in
mind
of
barbara
s
misfortune
and
i
chose
one
then
the
shopman
brought
forth
some
lockets
and
enlarged
upon
their
convenience
for
holding
deceased
relatives
hair
not
to
speak
of
sweethearts
until
i
told
him
he
might
attach
one
i
thought
it
might
hold
that
piece
of
hair
you
prize
barbara
he
concluded
dropping
his
voice
what
piece
asked
hare
carlyle
glanced
round
the
room
as
if
fearful
the
very
walls
might
hear
his
whisper
richard
s
barbara
showed
it
me
one
day
when
she
was
turning
out
her
desk
and
said
it
was
a
curl
taken
off
in
that
hare
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
shivering
visibly
the
words
evidently
awoke
some
poignant
source
of
deep
sorrow
oh
my
boy
my
boy
she
wailed
my
boy
my
unhappy
boy
hare
wonders
at
my
archibald
barbara
ridicules
it
but
there
lies
the
source
of
all
my
misery
mental
and
bodily
oh
richard
richard
there
was
a
distressing
pause
for
the
topic
admitted
of
neither
hope
nor
consolation
put
your
chain
on
again
barbara
carlyle
said
after
a
while
and
i
wish
you
health
to
wear
it
out
health
and
reformation
young
lady
barbara
smiled
and
glanced
at
him
with
her
pretty
blue
eyes
so
full
of
love
what
have
you
brought
for
cornelia
she
resumed
something
splendid
he
answered
with
a
mock
serious
face
only
i
hope
i
have
not
been
taken
in
i
bought
her
a
shawl
the
venders
vowed
it
was
true
parisian
cashmere
i
gave
eighteen
guineas
for
that
is
a
great
deal
observed
hare
it
ought
to
be
a
very
good
one
i
never
gave
more
than
six
guineas
for
a
shawl
in
all
my
and
cornelia
i
dare
say
never
more
than
half
six
laughed
carlyle
well
i
shall
wish
you
good
evening
and
go
to
her
for
if
she
knows
i
am
back
all
this
while
i
shall
be
he
shook
hands
with
them
both
barbara
however
accompanied
him
to
the
front
door
and
stepped
outside
with
him
you
will
catch
cold
barbara
you
have
left
your
shawl
oh
no
i
shall
not
how
very
soon
you
are
leaving
you
have
scarcely
stayed
ten
but
you
forget
i
have
not
been
at
you
were
on
your
road
to
beauchamp
s
and
would
not
have
been
at
home
for
an
hour
or
two
in
that
case
spoke
barbara
in
a
tone
that
savored
of
resentment
that
was
different
that
was
upon
business
but
barbara
i
think
your
mother
looks
unusually
you
know
she
suffers
a
little
thing
to
upset
her
and
last
night
she
had
what
she
calls
one
of
her
dreams
answered
barbara
she
says
that
it
is
a
warning
that
something
bad
is
going
to
happen
and
she
has
been
in
the
most
unhappy
feverish
state
possible
all
day
papa
has
been
quite
angry
over
her
being
so
weak
and
nervous
declaring
that
she
ought
to
rouse
herself
out
of
her
of
course
we
dare
not
tell
him
about
the
it
related
to
the
carlyle
stopped
and
barbara
glanced
round
with
a
shudder
and
drew
closer
to
him
as
she
whispered
he
had
not
given
her
his
arm
this
time
yes
to
the
murder
you
know
mamma
has
always
declared
that
bethel
had
something
to
do
with
it
she
says
her
dreams
would
have
convinced
her
of
it
if
nothing
else
did
and
she
dreamt
she
saw
him
with
with
you
hallijohn
whispered
carlyle
with
hallijohn
assented
barbara
with
a
shiver
he
was
standing
over
him
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
just
as
he
did
lay
on
it
and
that
wretched
afy
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
looking
but
hare
ought
not
to
suffer
dreams
to
disturb
her
peace
by
day
remonstrated
carlyle
it
is
not
to
be
surprised
at
that
she
dreams
of
the
murder
because
she
is
always
dwelling
upon
it
but
she
should
strive
and
throw
the
feeling
from
her
with
the
you
know
what
mamma
is
of
course
she
ought
to
do
so
but
she
does
not
papa
wonders
what
makes
her
get
up
so
ill
and
trembling
of
a
morning
and
mamma
has
to
make
all
sorts
of
evasive
excuses
for
not
a
hint
as
you
are
aware
must
be
breathed
to
him
about
the
carlyle
gravely
nodded
mamma
does
so
harp
about
bethel
and
i
know
that
dream
arose
from
nothing
in
the
world
but
because
she
saw
him
pass
the
gate
yesterday
not
that
she
thinks
that
it
was
he
who
did
it
unfortunately
there
is
no
room
for
that
but
she
will
persist
that
he
had
a
hand
in
it
in
some
way
and
he
haunts
her
carlyle
walked
on
in
silence
indeed
there
was
no
reply
that
he
could
make
a
cloud
had
fallen
upon
the
house
of
hare
and
it
was
an
unhappy
subject
barbara
continued
but
for
mamma
to
have
taken
it
into
her
head
that
some
evil
is
going
to
happen
because
she
had
this
dream
and
to
make
herself
miserable
over
it
is
so
absurd
that
i
have
felt
quite
cross
with
her
all
day
such
nonsense
you
know
archibald
to
believe
that
dreams
give
signs
of
what
is
going
to
happen
so
far
behind
these
enlightened
days
your
mamma
s
trouble
is
great
barbara
and
she
is
not
i
think
all
our
troubles
have
been
great
since
since
that
dark
evening
responded
barbara
have
you
heard
from
anne
inquired
carlyle
willing
to
change
the
subject
yes
she
is
very
well
what
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
name
the
baby
anne
after
her
mamma
so
very
ugly
a
name
anne
i
do
not
think
so
said
carlyle
it
is
simple
and
unpretending
i
like
it
much
look
at
the
long
pretentious
names
of
our
family
archibald
cornelia
and
yours
too
barbara
what
a
mouthful
they
all
are
barbara
contracted
her
eyebrows
it
was
equivalent
to
saying
that
he
did
not
like
her
name
they
reached
the
gate
and
carlyle
was
about
to
pass
out
of
it
when
barbara
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
to
detain
him
and
spoke
in
a
timid
voice
archibald
what
is
it
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
thanks
to
you
for
this
she
said
touching
the
chain
and
locket
my
tongue
seemed
tied
do
not
deem
me
you
foolish
girl
it
is
not
worth
them
there
now
i
am
paid
night
he
had
bent
down
and
kissed
her
cheek
swung
through
the
gate
laughing
and
strode
away
don
t
say
i
never
gave
you
anything
he
turned
his
head
round
to
say
all
her
veins
were
tingling
all
her
pulses
beating
her
heart
was
throbbing
with
its
sense
of
bliss
he
had
never
kissed
her
that
she
could
remember
since
she
was
a
child
and
when
she
returned
indoors
her
spirits
were
so
extravagantly
high
that
hare
wondered
ring
for
the
lamp
barbara
and
you
can
get
to
your
work
but
don
t
have
the
shutters
closed
i
like
to
look
out
on
these
light
barbara
however
did
not
get
to
her
work
she
also
perhaps
liked
looking
out
on
a
light
night
for
she
sat
down
at
the
window
she
was
living
the
last
half
hour
over
again
don
t
say
i
never
gave
you
anything
she
murmured
did
he
allude
to
the
chain
or
to
the
kiss
oh
archibald
why
don
t
you
say
that
you
love
me
carlyle
had
been
all
his
life
upon
intimate
terms
with
the
hare
family
his
father
s
first
wife
for
the
late
lawyer
carlyle
had
been
twice
married
had
been
a
cousin
of
justice
hare
s
and
this
had
caused
them
to
be
much
together
archibald
the
child
of
the
second
carlyle
had
alternately
teased
and
petted
anne
and
barbara
hare
boy
fashion
sometimes
he
quarreled
with
the
pretty
little
girls
sometimes
he
caressed
them
as
he
would
have
done
had
they
been
his
sisters
and
he
made
no
scruple
of
declaring
publicly
to
the
pair
that
anne
was
his
favorite
a
gentle
yielding
girl
she
was
like
her
mother
whereas
barbara
displayed
her
own
will
and
it
sometimes
clashed
with
young
carlyle
s
the
clock
struck
ten
hare
took
her
customary
sup
of
brandy
and
water
a
small
tumbler
three
parts
full
without
it
she
believed
she
could
never
get
to
sleep
it
deadened
unhappy
thought
she
said
barbara
after
making
it
had
turned
again
to
the
window
but
she
did
not
resume
her
seat
she
stood
right
in
front
of
it
her
forehead
bent
forward
against
its
middle
pane
the
lamp
casting
a
bright
light
was
behind
her
so
that
her
figure
might
be
distinctly
observable
from
the
lawn
had
any
one
been
there
to
look
upon
it
she
stood
there
in
the
midst
of
dreamland
giving
way
to
all
its
enchanting
and
most
delusive
fascinations
she
saw
herself
in
anticipation
the
wife
of
carlyle
the
envied
thrice
envied
of
all
west
lynne
for
like
as
he
was
the
dearest
on
earth
to
her
heart
so
was
he
the
greatest
match
in
the
neighborhood
around
not
a
mother
but
what
coveted
him
for
her
child
and
not
a
daughter
but
would
have
said
yes
and
thank
you
to
an
offer
from
the
attractive
archibald
carlyle
i
never
was
sure
quite
sure
of
it
till
murmured
barbara
caressing
the
locket
and
holding
it
to
her
cheek
i
always
thought
he
meant
something
or
he
might
mean
nothing
but
to
give
me
this
to
kiss
me
oh
archibald
a
pause
barbara
s
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
moonlight
if
he
would
but
say
he
loved
me
if
he
would
but
save
the
suspense
of
my
aching
heart
but
it
must
come
i
know
it
will
and
if
that
cantankerous
toad
of
a
corny
barbara
hare
stopped
what
was
that
at
the
far
end
of
the
lawn
just
in
advance
of
the
shade
of
the
thick
trees
their
leaves
were
not
causing
the
movement
for
it
was
a
still
night
it
had
been
there
some
minutes
it
was
evidently
a
human
form
what
was
it
surely
it
was
making
signs
to
her
or
else
it
looked
as
though
it
was
that
was
certainly
its
arm
moving
and
now
it
advanced
a
pace
nearer
and
raised
something
which
it
wore
on
its
head
a
battered
hat
with
a
broad
brim
a
encircled
with
a
wisp
of
straw
barbara
hare
s
heart
leaped
as
the
saying
runs
into
her
mouth
and
her
face
became
deadly
white
in
the
moonlight
her
first
thought
was
to
alarm
the
servants
her
second
to
be
still
for
she
remembered
the
fear
and
mystery
that
attached
to
the
house
she
went
into
the
hall
shutting
her
mamma
in
the
parlor
and
stood
in
the
shade
of
the
portico
gazing
still
but
the
figure
evidently
followed
her
movement
with
its
sight
and
the
hat
was
again
taken
off
and
waved
violently
barbara
hare
turned
sick
with
utter
terror
she
must
fathom
it
she
must
see
who
and
what
it
was
for
the
servants
she
dared
not
call
and
those
movements
were
imperative
and
might
not
be
disregarded
but
she
possessed
more
innate
courage
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
some
young
ladies
mamma
she
said
returning
to
the
parlor
and
catching
up
her
shawl
while
striving
to
speak
without
emotion
i
shall
just
walk
down
the
path
and
see
if
papa
is
hare
did
not
reply
she
was
musing
upon
other
things
in
that
quiescent
happy
mood
which
a
small
portion
of
spirits
will
impart
to
one
weak
in
body
and
barbara
softly
closed
the
door
and
stole
out
again
to
the
portico
she
stood
a
moment
to
rally
her
courage
and
again
the
hat
was
waved
impatiently
barbara
hare
commenced
her
walk
towards
it
in
dread
unutterable
an
undefined
sense
of
evil
filling
her
sinking
heart
mingling
with
which
came
with
a
rush
of
terror
a
fear
of
that
other
undefinable
evil
the
evil
hare
had
declared
was
foreboded
by
her
dream
chapter
iv
the
moonlight
interview
cold
and
still
looked
the
old
house
in
the
moonbeams
never
was
the
moon
brighter
it
lighted
the
garden
it
illuminated
even
the
weathercock
aloft
it
shone
upon
the
portico
and
upon
one
who
appeared
in
it
stealing
to
the
portico
from
the
house
had
come
barbara
hare
her
eyes
strained
in
dread
affright
on
the
grove
of
trees
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
what
was
it
that
had
stepped
out
of
that
grove
of
trees
and
mysteriously
beckoned
to
her
as
she
stood
at
the
window
turning
her
heart
to
sickness
as
she
gazed
was
it
a
human
being
one
to
bring
more
evil
to
the
house
where
so
much
evil
had
already
fallen
was
it
a
supernatural
visitant
or
was
it
but
a
delusion
of
her
own
eyesight
not
the
latter
certainly
for
the
figure
was
now
emerging
again
motioning
to
her
as
before
and
with
a
white
face
and
shaking
limbs
barbara
clutched
her
shawl
around
her
and
went
down
that
path
in
the
moonlight
the
beckoning
form
retreated
within
the
dark
recess
as
she
neared
it
and
barbara
halted
who
and
what
are
you
she
asked
under
her
breath
what
do
you
want
barbara
was
the
whispered
eager
answer
don
t
you
recognize
me
too
surely
she
did
the
voice
at
any
rate
and
a
cry
escaped
her
telling
more
of
sorrow
than
of
joy
though
betraying
both
she
penetrated
the
trees
and
burst
into
tears
as
one
in
the
dress
of
a
farm
laborer
caught
her
in
his
arms
in
spite
of
his
and
his
hat
and
his
false
whiskers
black
as
erebus
she
knew
him
for
her
brother
oh
richard
where
have
you
come
from
what
brings
you
here
did
you
know
me
barbara
was
his
rejoinder
how
was
it
likely
in
this
disguise
a
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
it
might
be
some
one
from
you
and
even
that
made
me
sick
with
terror
how
could
you
run
such
a
risk
as
to
come
here
she
added
wringing
her
hands
if
you
are
discovered
it
is
certain
death
death
upon
you
know
upon
the
gibbet
returned
richard
hare
i
do
know
it
then
why
risk
it
should
mamma
see
you
it
will
kill
her
i
can
t
live
on
as
i
am
living
he
answered
gloomily
i
have
been
working
in
london
ever
since
in
london
interrupted
barbara
in
london
and
have
never
stirred
out
of
it
but
it
is
hard
work
for
me
and
now
i
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
better
if
i
can
get
a
little
money
perhaps
my
mother
can
let
me
have
it
it
is
what
i
have
come
to
ask
how
are
you
working
what
at
in
a
a
she
uttered
in
a
deeply
shocked
tone
richard
did
you
expect
it
would
be
as
a
merchant
or
a
banker
or
perhaps
as
secretary
to
one
of
her
majesty
s
ministers
or
that
i
was
a
gentleman
at
large
living
on
my
fortune
retorted
richard
hare
in
a
tone
of
chafed
anguish
painful
to
hear
i
get
twelve
shillings
a
week
and
that
has
to
find
me
in
everything
poor
richard
poor
richard
she
wailed
caressing
his
hand
and
weeping
over
it
oh
what
a
miserable
night
s
work
that
was
our
only
comfort
is
richard
that
you
must
have
committed
the
deed
in
i
did
not
commit
it
at
all
he
replied
what
she
exclaimed
barbara
i
swear
that
i
am
innocent
i
swear
i
was
not
present
when
the
man
was
murdered
i
swear
that
from
my
own
positive
knowledge
my
eyesight
i
know
no
more
who
did
it
than
you
the
guessing
at
it
is
enough
for
me
and
my
guess
is
as
sure
and
true
a
one
as
that
the
moon
is
in
the
barbara
shivered
as
she
drew
close
to
him
it
was
a
shivering
subject
you
surely
do
not
mean
to
throw
the
guilt
on
bethel
bethel
lightly
returned
richard
hare
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
was
after
his
gins
and
his
snares
that
night
though
poacher
as
he
is
bethel
is
no
poacher
is
he
not
rejoined
richard
hare
significantly
the
truth
as
to
what
he
is
may
come
out
some
time
not
that
i
wish
it
to
come
out
the
man
has
done
no
harm
to
me
and
he
may
go
on
poaching
with
impunity
till
doomsday
for
all
i
care
he
and
locksley
richard
interrupted
his
sister
in
a
hushed
voice
mamma
entertains
one
fixed
idea
which
she
can
not
put
from
her
she
is
certain
that
bethel
had
something
to
do
with
the
then
she
is
wrong
why
should
she
think
so
how
the
conviction
arose
at
first
i
can
not
tell
you
i
do
not
think
she
knows
herself
but
you
remember
how
weak
and
fanciful
she
is
and
since
that
dreadful
night
she
is
always
having
what
she
calls
dreams
meaning
that
she
dreams
of
the
murder
in
all
these
dreams
bethel
is
prominent
and
she
says
she
feels
an
absolute
certainty
that
he
was
in
some
way
or
other
mixed
up
in
barbara
he
was
no
more
mixed
up
in
it
than
and
you
say
that
you
were
not
i
was
not
even
at
the
cottage
at
the
time
i
swear
it
to
you
the
man
who
did
the
deed
was
thorn
echoed
barbara
lifting
her
head
who
is
thorn
i
don
t
know
who
i
wish
i
did
i
wish
i
could
unearth
him
he
was
a
friend
of
afy
barbara
threw
back
her
neck
with
a
haughty
gesture
richard
what
you
forget
yourself
when
you
mention
that
name
to
well
returned
richard
it
was
not
to
discuss
these
things
that
i
put
myself
in
jeopardy
and
to
assert
my
innocence
can
do
no
good
it
can
not
set
aside
the
coroner
s
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
richard
hare
the
is
my
father
as
bitter
against
me
as
ever
quite
he
never
mentions
your
name
or
suffers
it
to
be
mentioned
he
gave
his
orders
to
the
servants
that
it
never
was
to
be
spoken
in
the
house
again
eliza
could
not
or
would
not
remember
and
she
persisted
in
calling
your
room
mr
richard
i
think
the
woman
did
it
heedlessly
not
maliciously
to
provoke
papa
she
was
a
good
servant
and
had
been
with
us
three
years
you
know
the
first
time
she
transgressed
papa
warned
her
the
second
he
thundered
at
her
as
i
believe
nobody
else
in
the
world
can
thunder
and
the
third
he
turned
her
from
the
doors
never
allowing
her
to
get
her
bonnet
one
of
the
others
carrying
her
bonnet
and
shawl
to
the
gate
and
her
boxes
were
sent
away
the
same
day
papa
took
an
oath
did
you
hear
of
it
what
oath
he
takes
this
was
a
solemn
one
richard
after
the
delivery
of
the
verdict
he
took
an
oath
in
the
in
the
presence
of
his
brother
magistrates
that
if
he
could
find
you
he
would
deliver
you
up
to
justice
and
that
he
would
do
it
though
you
might
not
turn
up
for
ten
years
to
come
you
know
his
disposition
richard
and
therefore
may
be
sure
he
will
keep
it
indeed
it
is
most
dangerous
for
you
to
be
i
know
that
he
never
treated
me
as
he
ought
cried
richard
bitterly
if
my
health
was
delicate
causing
my
poor
mother
to
indulge
me
ought
that
to
have
been
a
reason
for
his
ridiculing
me
on
every
possible
occasion
public
and
private
had
my
home
been
made
happier
i
should
not
have
sought
the
society
i
did
elsewhere
barbara
i
must
be
allowed
an
interview
with
my
barbara
hare
reflected
before
she
spoke
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
be
why
can
t
she
come
out
to
me
as
you
have
done
is
she
up
or
in
bed
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
it
returned
barbara
in
an
alarmed
tone
papa
may
be
in
at
any
moment
he
is
spending
the
evening
at
beauchamp
it
is
hard
to
have
been
separated
from
her
for
eighteen
months
and
to
go
back
without
seeing
her
returned
richard
and
about
the
money
it
is
a
hundred
pounds
that
i
you
must
be
here
again
night
richard
the
money
no
doubt
can
be
yours
but
i
am
not
so
sure
about
your
seeing
mamma
i
am
terrified
for
your
safety
but
if
it
is
as
you
say
that
you
are
innocent
she
added
after
a
pause
could
it
not
be
proved
who
is
to
prove
it
the
evidence
is
strong
against
me
and
thorn
did
i
mention
him
would
be
as
a
myth
to
other
people
nobody
knew
anything
of
is
he
a
myth
said
barbara
in
a
low
voice
are
you
and
i
myths
retorted
richard
so
even
you
doubt
me
richard
she
suddenly
exclaimed
why
not
tell
the
whole
circumstances
to
archibald
carlyle
if
any
one
can
help
you
or
take
measures
to
establish
your
innocence
he
can
and
you
know
that
he
is
true
as
there
s
no
other
man
living
should
be
trusted
with
the
secret
that
i
am
here
except
carlyle
where
is
it
they
suppose
that
i
am
barbara
some
think
that
you
are
dead
some
that
you
are
in
australia
the
very
uncertainty
has
nearly
killed
mamma
a
report
arose
that
you
had
been
seen
at
liverpool
in
an
ship
but
we
could
not
trace
it
to
any
it
had
none
i
dodged
my
way
to
london
and
there
i
have
working
in
a
i
could
not
do
better
i
was
not
brought
up
to
anything
and
i
did
understand
horses
besides
a
man
that
the
were
after
could
be
more
safe
in
obscurity
considering
that
he
was
a
gentleman
than
barbara
turned
suddenly
and
placed
her
hand
upon
her
brother
s
mouth
be
silent
for
your
life
she
whispered
here
s
voices
were
heard
approaching
the
gate
those
of
justice
hare
and
squire
pinner
the
latter
walked
on
the
former
came
in
the
brother
and
sister
cowered
together
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
you
might
have
heard
barbara
s
heart
beating
hare
closed
the
gate
and
walked
on
up
the
path
i
must
go
richard
said
barbara
hastily
i
dare
not
stay
another
minute
be
here
again
night
and
meanwhile
i
will
see
what
can
be
she
was
speeding
away
but
richard
held
her
back
you
did
not
seem
to
believe
my
assertion
of
innocence
barbara
we
are
here
alone
in
the
still
night
with
god
above
us
as
truly
as
that
you
and
i
must
sometime
meet
him
face
to
face
i
told
you
the
truth
it
was
thorn
murdered
hallijohn
and
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
barbara
broke
out
of
the
trees
and
flew
along
but
hare
was
already
in
locking
and
barring
the
door
let
me
in
papa
she
called
out
the
justice
opened
the
door
again
and
thrusting
forth
his
flaxen
wig
his
aquiline
nose
and
his
amazed
eyes
gazed
at
barbara
halloo
what
brings
you
out
at
this
time
of
night
young
lady
i
went
down
to
the
gate
to
look
for
you
she
panted
and
had
had
strolled
over
to
the
side
path
did
you
not
see
me
barbara
was
truthful
by
nature
and
habit
but
in
such
a
cause
how
could
she
avoid
dissimulation
thank
you
papa
she
said
as
she
went
in
you
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
an
hour
ago
angrily
responded
justice

chapter
carlyle
s
office
in
the
centre
of
west
lynne
stood
two
houses
adjoining
each
other
one
large
the
other
much
smaller
the
large
one
was
the
carlyle
residence
and
the
small
one
was
devoted
to
the
carlyle
offices
the
name
of
carlyle
bore
a
lofty
standing
in
the
county
carlyle
and
davidson
were
known
as
practitioners
no
pettifogging
lawyers
were
they
it
was
carlyle
davidson
in
the
days
gone
by
now
it
was
archibald
carlyle
the
old
firm
were
the
first
carlyle
having
been
davidson
s
sister
she
had
died
and
left
one
child
the
second
carlyle
died
when
her
son
was
born
archibald
and
his
sister
reared
him
loved
him
and
ruled
him
she
bore
for
him
all
the
authority
of
a
mother
the
boy
had
known
no
other
and
when
a
little
child
he
had
called
her
mamma
corny
mamma
corny
had
done
her
duty
by
him
that
was
undoubted
but
mamma
corny
had
never
relaxed
her
rule
with
an
iron
hand
she
liked
to
rule
him
now
in
great
things
as
in
small
just
as
she
had
done
in
the
days
of
his
babyhood
and
archibald
generally
submitted
for
the
force
of
habit
is
strong
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
sense
but
in
some
things
weak
of
judgment
and
the
ruling
passions
of
her
life
were
love
of
archibald
and
love
of
saving
money
davidson
had
died
earlier
than
carlyle
and
his
fortune
he
had
never
married
was
left
equally
divided
between
cornelia
and
archibald
archibald
was
no
blood
relation
to
him
but
he
loved
the
boy
better
than
his
niece
cornelia
of
carlyle
s
property
a
small
portion
only
was
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
the
rest
to
his
son
and
in
this
perhaps
there
was
justice
since
the
pounds
brought
to
carlyle
by
his
second
wife
had
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
the
accumulation
of
his
large
fortune
miss
carlyle
or
as
she
was
called
in
town
miss
corny
had
never
married
it
was
pretty
certain
she
never
would
people
thought
that
her
intense
love
of
her
young
brother
kept
her
single
for
it
was
not
likely
that
the
daughter
of
the
rich
carlyle
had
wanted
for
offers
other
maidens
confess
to
soft
and
tender
impressions
not
so
miss
carlyle
all
who
had
approached
her
with
the
lovelorn
tale
she
sent
quickly
to
the
carlyle
was
seated
in
his
own
private
room
in
his
office
the
morning
after
his
return
from
town
his
confidential
clerk
and
manager
stood
near
him
it
was
dill
a
little
man
with
a
bald
head
he
was
on
the
rolls
had
been
admitted
years
and
years
ago
but
he
had
never
set
up
for
himself
perhaps
he
deemed
the
post
of
head
manager
in
the
office
of
carlyle
davidson
with
its
substantial
salary
sufficient
for
his
ambition
and
manager
he
had
been
to
them
when
the
present
carlyle
was
in
long
petticoats
he
was
a
single
man
and
occupied
handsome
apartments
near
between
the
room
of
carlyle
and
that
of
the
clerks
was
a
small
square
space
or
hall
having
ingress
also
from
the
house
passage
another
room
opened
from
it
a
narrow
one
which
was
dill
s
own
peculiar
sanctum
here
he
saw
clients
when
carlyle
was
out
or
engaged
and
here
he
issued
private
orders
a
little
window
not
larger
than
a
pane
of
glass
looked
out
from
the
clerk
s
office
they
called
it
old
dill
s
and
wished
it
anywhere
else
for
his
spectacles
might
be
discerned
at
it
more
frequently
than
was
agreeable
the
old
gentleman
had
a
desk
also
in
their
office
and
there
he
frequently
sat
he
was
sitting
there
in
state
this
same
morning
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
around
him
when
the
door
timidly
opened
and
the
pretty
face
of
barbara
hare
appeared
at
it
rosy
with
blushes
can
i
see
carlyle
dill
rose
from
his
seat
and
shook
hands
with
her
she
drew
him
into
the
passage
and
he
closed
the
door
perhaps
he
felt
surprised
for
it
was
not
the
custom
for
ladies
young
and
single
to
come
there
after
carlyle
presently
miss
barbara
he
is
engaged
just
now
the
justices
are
with
the
justices
uttered
barbara
in
alarm
and
papa
one
whatever
shall
i
do
he
must
not
see
me
i
would
not
have
him
see
me
here
for
the
an
ominous
sound
of
talking
the
justices
were
evidently
coming
forth
dill
laid
hold
of
barbara
whisked
her
through
the
clerks
room
not
daring
to
take
her
the
other
way
lest
he
should
encounter
them
and
shut
her
in
his
own
what
the
plague
brought
papa
here
at
this
moment
thought
barbara
whose
face
was
crimson
a
few
minutes
and
dill
opened
the
door
again
they
are
gone
now
and
the
coast
s
clear
miss
i
don
t
know
what
opinion
you
must
form
of
me
dill
she
whispered
but
i
will
tell
you
in
confidence
that
i
am
here
on
some
private
business
for
mamma
who
was
not
well
enough
to
come
herself
it
is
a
little
private
matter
that
she
does
not
wish
papa
to
know
child
answered
the
manager
a
lawyer
receives
visits
from
many
people
and
it
is
not
the
place
of
those
about
him
to
he
opened
the
door
as
he
spoke
ushered
her
into
the
presence
of
carlyle
and
left
her
the
latter
rose
in
astonishment
you
must
regard
me
as
a
client
and
pardon
my
intrusion
said
barbara
with
a
forced
laugh
to
hide
her
agitation
i
am
here
on
the
part
of
mamma
and
i
nearly
met
papa
in
your
passage
which
terrified
me
out
of
my
senses
dill
shut
me
into
his
carlyle
motioned
to
barbara
to
seat
herself
then
resumed
his
own
seat
beside
his
table
barbara
could
not
help
noticing
how
different
his
manners
were
in
his
office
from
his
evening
manners
when
he
was
off
here
he
was
the
staid
calm
man
of
business
i
have
a
strange
thing
to
tell
you
she
began
in
a
whisper
but
it
is
impossible
that
any
one
can
hear
us
she
broke
off
with
a
look
of
dread
it
would
be
it
might
be
death
it
is
quite
impossible
calmly
replied
carlyle
the
doors
are
double
doors
did
you
notice
that
they
were
nevertheless
she
left
her
chair
and
stood
close
to
carlyle
resting
her
hand
upon
the
table
he
rose
of
course
richard
is
here
richard
repeated
carlyle
at
west
lynne
he
appeared
at
the
house
last
night
in
disguise
and
made
signs
to
me
from
the
grove
of
trees
you
may
imagine
my
alarm
he
has
been
in
london
all
this
while
half
starving
working
i
feel
ashamed
to
mention
it
to
you
in
a
and
oh
archibald
he
says
he
is
carlyle
made
no
reply
to
this
he
probably
had
no
faith
in
the
assertion
sit
down
barbara
he
said
drawing
her
chair
closer
barbara
sat
down
again
but
her
manner
was
hurried
and
nervous
is
it
quite
sure
that
no
stranger
will
be
coming
in
it
would
look
so
peculiar
to
see
me
here
but
mamma
was
too
unwell
to
come
herself
or
rather
she
feared
papa
s
questioning
if
he
found
out
that
she
be
at
ease
replied
carlyle
this
room
is
sacred
from
the
intrusion
of
strangers
what
of
richard
he
says
that
he
was
not
in
the
cottage
at
the
time
the
murder
was
committed
that
the
person
who
really
did
it
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
what
thorn
asked
carlyle
suppressing
all
signs
of
incredulity
i
don
t
know
a
friend
of
afy
s
he
said
archibald
he
swore
to
it
in
the
most
solemn
manner
and
i
believe
as
truly
as
that
i
am
now
repeating
it
to
you
that
he
was
speaking
the
truth
i
want
you
to
see
richard
if
possible
he
is
coming
to
the
same
place
if
he
can
tell
his
own
tale
to
you
perhaps
you
may
find
out
a
way
by
which
his
innocence
may
be
made
manifest
you
are
so
clever
you
can
do
carlyle
smiled
not
quite
anything
barbara
was
this
the
purport
of
richard
s
visit
to
say
this
oh
no
he
thinks
it
is
of
no
use
to
say
it
for
nobody
would
believe
him
against
the
evidence
he
came
to
ask
for
a
hundred
pounds
he
says
he
has
an
opportunity
of
doing
better
if
he
can
have
that
sum
mamma
has
sent
me
to
you
she
has
not
the
money
by
her
and
she
dare
not
ask
papa
for
it
as
it
is
for
richard
she
bade
me
say
that
if
you
will
kindly
oblige
her
with
the
money
she
will
arrange
with
you
about
the
do
you
want
it
now
asked
carlyle
if
so
i
must
send
to
the
bank
dill
never
keeps
much
money
in
the
house
when
i
m
not
until
evening
can
you
manage
to
see
richard
it
is
hazardous
mused
carlyle
for
him
i
mean
still
if
he
is
to
be
in
the
grove
i
may
as
well
be
there
also
what
disguise
is
he
in
a
farm
laborer
s
the
best
he
could
adopt
about
here
with
large
black
whiskers
he
is
stopping
about
three
miles
off
he
said
in
some
obscure
and
now
continued
barbara
i
want
you
to
advise
me
had
i
better
inform
mamma
that
richard
is
here
or
not
carlyle
did
not
understand
and
said
so
i
declare
i
am
bewildered
she
exclaimed
i
should
have
premised
that
i
have
not
yet
told
mamma
it
is
richard
himself
who
is
here
but
that
he
has
sent
a
messenger
to
beg
for
this
money
would
it
be
advisable
to
acquaint
her
why
should
you
not
i
think
you
ought
to
do
then
i
will
i
was
fearing
the
hazard
for
she
is
sure
to
insist
upon
seeing
him
richard
also
wishes
for
an
it
is
only
natural
hare
must
be
thankful
to
hear
so
far
that
he
is
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
returned
barbara
the
change
is
akin
to
magic
she
says
it
has
put
life
into
her
anew
and
now
for
the
last
thing
how
can
we
secure
papa
s
absence
from
home
it
must
be
accomplished
in
some
way
you
know
his
temper
were
i
or
mamma
to
suggest
to
him
to
go
and
see
some
friend
or
to
go
to
the
club
he
would
immediately
stop
at
home
can
you
devise
any
plan
you
see
i
appeal
to
you
in
all
my
troubles
she
added
like
i
and
anne
used
to
do
when
we
were
it
may
be
questioned
if
carlyle
heard
the
last
remark
he
had
dropped
his
eyelids
in
thought
have
you
told
me
all
he
asked
presently
lifting
them
i
think
then
i
will
consider
it
over
and
i
shall
not
like
to
come
here
again
interrupted
barbara
it
it
might
excite
suspicions
some
one
might
see
me
too
and
mention
it
to
papa
neither
ought
you
to
send
to
our
well
contrive
to
be
in
the
street
at
four
this
afternoon
stay
that
s
your
dinner
hour
be
walking
up
the
street
at
three
three
precisely
i
will
meet
he
rose
shook
hands
and
escorted
barbara
through
the
small
hall
along
the
passage
to
the
house
door
a
courtesy
probably
not
yet
shown
to
any
client
by
carlyle
the
house
door
closed
upon
her
and
barbara
had
taken
one
step
from
it
when
something
large
loomed
down
upon
her
like
a
ship
in
full
sail
she
must
have
been
the
tallest
lady
in
the
world
out
of
a
caravan
a
fine
woman
in
her
day
but
angular
and
bony
now
still
in
spite
of
the
angles
and
the
bones
there
was
majesty
in
the
appearance
of
miss
carlyle
why
what
on
earth
began
she
have
you
been
with
archibald
for
barbara
hare
wishing
miss
carlyle
over
in
asia
stammered
out
the
excuse
she
had
given
dill
your
mamma
sent
you
on
business
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
twice
i
have
been
to
see
archibald
and
twice
did
dill
answer
that
he
was
engaged
and
must
not
be
interrupted
i
shall
make
old
dill
explain
his
meaning
for
observing
a
mystery
over
it
to
there
is
no
mystery
answered
barbara
feeling
quite
sick
lest
miss
carlyle
should
proclaim
there
was
before
the
clerks
or
her
father
mamma
wanted
carlyle
s
opinion
upon
a
little
private
business
and
not
feeling
well
enough
to
come
herself
she
sent
miss
carlyle
did
not
believe
a
word
what
business
asked
she
unceremoniously
it
is
nothing
that
could
interest
you
a
trifling
matter
relating
to
a
little
money
it
s
nothing
then
if
it
s
nothing
why
were
you
closeted
so
long
with
archibald
he
was
asking
the
particulars
replied
barbara
recovering
her
equanimity
miss
carlyle
sniffed
as
she
invariably
did
when
dissenting
from
a
problem
she
was
sure
there
was
some
mystery
astir
she
turned
and
walked
down
the
street
with
barbara
but
she
was
none
the
more
likely
to
get
anything
out
of
her
carlyle
returned
to
his
room
deliberated
a
few
moments
and
then
rang
his
bell
a
clerk
answered
it
go
to
the
buck
s
head
if
hare
and
the
other
magistrates
are
there
ask
them
to
step
over
to
the
young
man
did
as
he
was
bid
and
came
back
with
the
noted
justices
at
his
heels
they
obeyed
the
summons
with
alacrity
for
they
believed
they
had
got
themselves
into
a
judicial
scrape
and
that
carlyle
alone
could
get
them
out
of
it
i
will
not
request
you
to
sit
down
began
carlyle
for
it
is
barely
a
moment
i
shall
detain
you
the
more
i
think
about
this
man
s
having
been
put
in
prison
the
less
i
like
it
and
i
have
been
considering
that
you
had
better
all
five
come
and
smoke
your
pipes
at
my
house
this
evening
when
we
shall
have
time
to
discuss
what
must
be
done
come
at
seven
not
later
and
you
will
find
my
father
s
old
jar
replenished
with
the
best
broadcut
and
half
a
dozen
churchwarden
pipes
shall
it
be
so
the
whole
five
accepted
the
invitation
eagerly
and
they
were
filing
out
when
carlyle
laid
his
finger
on
the
arm
of
justice
hare
you
will
be
sure
to
come
hare
he
whispered
we
could
not
get
on
without
you
all
heads
with
a
slight
inclination
towards
those
going
out
are
not
gifted
with
the
clear
good
sense
of
sure
and
certain
responded
the
gratified
justice
fire
and
water
shouldn
t
keep
me
soon
after
carlyle
was
left
alone
another
clerk
entered
miss
carlyle
is
asking
to
see
you
sir
and
colonel
bethel
s
come
send
in
miss
carlyle
first
was
the
answer
what
is
it
cornelia
ah
you
may
well
ask
what
saying
this
morning
that
you
could
not
dine
at
six
as
usual
and
then
marching
off
and
never
fixing
the
hour
how
can
i
give
my
orders
i
thought
business
would
have
called
me
out
but
i
am
not
going
now
we
will
dine
a
little
earlier
though
cornelia
say
a
quarter
before
six
i
have
invited
what
s
up
archibald
interrupted
miss
carlyle
up
nothing
that
i
know
of
i
am
very
busy
cornelia
and
colonel
bethel
is
waiting
i
will
talk
to
you
at
i
have
invited
a
party
for
a
party
echoed
miss
carlyle
four
or
five
of
the
justices
are
coming
in
to
smoke
their
pipes
you
must
put
out
your
father
s
leaden
and
they
shan
t
come
screamed
miss
carlyle
do
you
think
i
ll
be
poisoned
with
tobacco
smoke
from
a
dozen
pipes
you
need
not
sit
in
the
nor
they
either
clean
curtains
are
just
put
up
throughout
the
house
and
i
ll
have
no
horrid
pipes
to
blacken
i
ll
buy
you
some
new
curtains
cornelia
if
their
pipes
spoil
these
he
quietly
replied
and
now
cornelia
i
really
must
beg
you
to
leave
when
i
have
come
to
the
bottom
of
this
affair
with
barbara
hare
resolutely
returned
miss
corny
dropping
the
point
of
the
contest
as
to
the
pipes
you
are
very
clever
archie
but
you
can
t
do
me
i
asked
barbara
what
she
came
here
for
business
for
mamma
touching
money
matters
was
her
reply
i
ask
you
to
hear
your
opinion
about
the
scrape
the
bench
have
got
into
is
yours
now
it
s
neither
one
nor
the
other
and
i
tell
you
archibald
i
ll
hear
what
it
is
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
and
barbara
do
with
a
secret
between
carlyle
knew
her
and
her
resolute
expression
well
and
he
took
his
course
to
tell
her
the
truth
she
was
to
borrow
the
words
barbara
had
used
to
her
brother
with
regard
to
him
true
as
steel
confide
to
miss
carlyle
a
secret
and
she
was
trustworthy
and
impervious
as
he
could
be
but
let
her
come
to
suspect
that
there
was
a
secret
which
was
being
kept
from
her
and
she
would
set
to
work
like
a
ferret
and
never
stop
until
it
was
unearthed
carlyle
bent
forward
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
i
will
tell
you
if
you
wish
cornelia
but
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
hear
richard
hare
has
miss
carlyle
looked
perfectly
aghast
richard
hare
is
he
mad
it
is
not
a
very
sane
proceeding
he
wants
money
from
his
mother
and
hare
sent
barbara
to
ask
me
to
manage
it
for
her
no
wonder
poor
barbara
was
flurried
and
nervous
for
there
s
danger
on
all
is
he
at
their
house
how
could
he
be
there
and
his
father
in
it
he
is
in
hiding
two
or
three
miles
off
disguised
as
a
laborer
and
will
be
at
the
grove
night
to
receive
this
money
i
have
invited
the
justices
to
get
hare
safe
away
from
his
own
house
if
he
saw
richard
he
would
undoubtedly
give
him
up
to
justice
and
putting
graver
considerations
aside
that
would
be
pleasant
for
neither
you
nor
for
me
to
have
a
connection
gibbeted
for
a
willful
murder
would
be
an
ugly
blot
on
the
carlyle
escutcheon
miss
carlyle
sat
in
silence
revolving
the
news
a
contraction
on
her
ample
brow
and
now
you
know
all
cornelia
and
i
do
beg
you
to
leave
me
for
i
am
overwhelmed
with
work
chapter
vi
richard
hare
the
younger
the
bench
of
justices
did
not
fail
to
keep
their
appointment
at
seven
o
clock
they
arrived
at
miss
carlyle
s
one
following
closely
upon
the
heels
of
another
the
reader
may
dissent
from
the
expression
miss
carlyle
s
but
it
is
the
correct
one
for
the
house
was
hers
not
her
brother
s
though
it
remained
his
home
as
it
had
been
in
his
father
s
time
the
house
was
among
the
property
bequeathed
to
miss
carlyle
miss
carlyle
chose
to
be
present
in
spite
of
the
pipes
and
the
smoke
and
she
was
soon
as
deep
in
the
discussion
as
the
justices
were
it
was
said
in
the
town
that
she
was
as
good
a
lawyer
as
her
father
had
been
she
undoubtedly
possessed
sound
judgment
in
legal
matters
and
quick
penetration
at
eight
o
clock
a
servant
entered
the
room
and
addressed
his
master
mr
dill
is
asking
to
see
you
carlyle
rose
and
came
back
with
an
open
note
in
his
hand
i
am
sorry
to
find
that
i
must
leave
you
for
half
an
hour
some
important
business
has
arisen
but
i
will
be
back
as
soon
as
i
who
has
sent
for
you
immediately
demanded
miss
corny
he
gave
her
a
quiet
look
which
she
interpreted
into
a
warning
not
to
question
mr
dill
is
here
and
will
join
you
to
talk
the
affair
over
he
said
to
his
guests
he
knows
the
law
better
than
i
do
but
i
will
not
be
he
quitted
his
house
and
walked
with
a
rapid
step
toward
the
grove
the
moon
was
bright
as
on
the
previous
evening
after
he
had
left
the
town
behind
him
and
was
passing
the
scattered
villas
already
mentioned
he
cast
an
involuntary
glance
at
the
wood
which
rose
behind
them
on
his
left
hand
it
was
called
abbey
wood
from
the
circumstance
that
in
old
days
an
abbey
had
stood
in
its
vicinity
all
traces
of
which
save
tradition
had
passed
away
there
was
one
small
house
or
cottage
just
within
the
wood
and
in
that
cottage
had
occurred
the
murder
for
which
richard
hare
s
life
was
in
jeopardy
it
was
no
longer
occupied
for
nobody
would
rent
it
or
live
in
it
carlyle
opened
the
gate
of
the
grove
and
glanced
at
the
trees
on
either
side
of
him
but
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
signs
of
richard
s
being
concealed
there
barbara
was
at
the
window
looking
out
and
she
came
herself
and
opened
the
door
to
carlyle
mamma
is
in
the
most
excited
state
she
whispered
to
him
as
he
entered
i
knew
how
it
would
has
he
come
yet
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
he
has
made
no
hare
feverish
and
agitated
with
a
burning
spot
on
her
delicate
cheeks
stood
by
the
chair
not
occupying
it
carlyle
placed
a
in
her
hands
i
have
brought
it
chiefly
in
notes
he
said
they
will
be
easier
for
him
to
carry
than
hare
answered
only
by
a
look
of
gratitude
and
clasped
carlyle
s
hand
in
both
hers
archibald
i
must
see
my
boy
how
can
it
be
managed
must
i
go
into
the
garden
to
him
or
may
he
come
in
here
i
think
he
might
come
in
you
know
how
bad
the
night
air
is
for
you
are
the
servants
astir
this
evening
things
seem
to
have
turned
out
quite
kindly
spoke
up
barbara
it
happens
to
be
anne
s
birthday
so
mamma
sent
me
just
now
into
the
kitchen
with
a
cake
and
a
bottle
of
wine
desiring
them
to
drink
her
health
i
shut
the
door
and
told
them
to
make
themselves
comfortable
that
if
we
wanted
anything
we
would
then
they
are
safe
observed
carlyle
and
richard
may
come
i
will
go
and
ascertain
whether
he
is
come
said
barbara
stay
where
you
are
barbara
i
will
go
myself
interposed
carlyle
have
the
door
open
when
you
see
us
coming
up
the
barbara
gave
a
faint
cry
and
trembling
clutched
the
arm
of
carlyle
there
he
is
see
standing
out
from
the
trees
just
opposite
this
carlyle
turned
to
hare
i
shall
not
bring
him
in
immediately
for
if
i
am
to
have
an
interview
with
him
it
must
be
got
over
first
that
i
may
go
back
home
to
the
justices
and
keep
hare
all
he
proceeded
on
his
way
gained
the
trees
and
plunged
into
them
and
leaning
against
one
stood
richard
hare
apart
from
his
disguise
and
the
false
and
fierce
black
whiskers
he
was
a
fair
looking
young
man
slight
and
of
middle
height
and
quite
as
yielding
and
gentle
as
his
mother
in
her
this
mild
yieldingness
of
disposition
was
rather
a
graceful
quality
in
richard
it
was
regarded
as
a
contemptible
misfortune
in
his
boyhood
he
had
been
nicknamed
leafy
dick
and
when
a
stranger
inquired
why
the
answer
was
that
as
a
leaf
was
swayed
by
the
wind
so
he
was
swayed
by
everybody
about
him
never
possessing
a
will
of
his
own
in
short
richard
hare
though
of
an
amiable
and
loving
nature
was
not
with
what
the
world
calls
brains
brains
he
certainly
had
but
they
were
not
sharp
ones
is
my
mother
coming
out
to
me
asked
richard
after
a
few
interchanged
sentences
with
carlyle
no
you
are
to
go
indoors
your
father
is
away
and
the
servants
are
shut
up
in
the
kitchen
and
will
not
see
you
though
if
they
did
they
could
never
recognize
you
in
that
trim
a
fine
pair
of
whiskers
let
us
go
in
then
i
am
all
in
a
twitter
till
i
get
away
am
i
to
have
the
money
yes
yes
but
richard
your
sister
says
you
wish
to
disclose
to
me
the
true
history
of
that
lamentable
night
you
had
better
speak
while
we
are
it
was
barbara
herself
wanted
you
to
hear
it
i
think
it
of
little
moment
if
the
whole
place
heard
the
truth
from
me
it
would
do
no
good
for
i
should
get
no
belief
not
even
from
try
me
richard
in
as
few
words
as
well
there
was
a
row
at
home
about
my
going
so
much
to
hallijohn
s
the
governor
and
my
mother
thought
i
went
after
afy
perhaps
i
did
and
perhaps
i
didn
t
hallijohn
had
asked
me
to
lend
him
my
gun
and
that
evening
when
i
went
to
see
af
when
i
went
to
see
some
one
never
richard
interrupted
carlyle
there
s
an
old
saying
and
it
is
sound
advice
tell
the
whole
truth
to
your
lawyer
and
your
if
i
am
to
judge
whether
anything
can
be
attempted
for
you
you
must
tell
it
to
me
otherwise
i
would
rather
hear
nothing
it
shall
be
sacred
then
if
i
must
i
must
returned
the
yielding
richard
i
did
love
the
girl
i
would
have
waited
till
i
was
my
own
master
to
make
her
my
wife
though
it
had
been
for
years
and
years
i
could
not
do
it
you
know
in
the
face
of
my
father
s
your
wife
rejoined
carlyle
with
some
emphasis
richard
looked
surprised
why
you
don
t
suppose
i
meant
anything
else
i
wouldn
t
have
been
such
a
well
go
on
richard
did
she
return
your
love
i
can
t
be
certain
sometimes
i
thought
she
did
sometimes
not
she
used
to
play
and
shuffle
and
she
liked
too
much
to
be
with
him
i
would
think
her
capricious
telling
me
i
must
not
come
this
evening
and
i
must
not
come
the
other
but
i
found
out
they
were
the
evenings
when
she
was
expecting
him
we
were
never
there
you
forget
that
you
have
not
indicted
him
by
any
name
richard
i
am
at
richard
hare
bent
forward
till
his
black
whiskers
brushed
carlyle
s
shoulder
it
was
that
cursed
carlyle
remembered
the
name
barbara
had
mentioned
who
was
thorn
i
never
heard
of
neither
had
anybody
else
i
expect
in
west
lynne
he
took
precious
good
care
of
that
he
lives
some
miles
away
and
used
to
come
over
in
courting
afy
yes
he
did
come
courting
her
returned
richard
in
a
savage
tone
distance
was
no
barrier
he
would
come
galloping
over
at
dusk
tie
his
horse
to
a
tree
in
the
wood
and
pass
an
hour
or
two
with
afy
in
the
house
when
her
father
was
not
at
home
roaming
about
the
woods
with
her
when
he
come
to
the
point
richard
to
the
hallijohn
s
gun
was
out
of
order
and
he
requested
the
loan
of
mine
i
had
made
an
appointment
with
afy
to
be
at
her
house
that
evening
and
i
went
down
after
dinner
carrying
the
gun
with
me
my
father
called
after
me
to
know
where
i
was
going
i
said
out
with
young
beauchamp
not
caring
to
meet
his
opposition
and
the
lie
told
against
me
at
the
inquest
when
i
reached
hallijohn
s
going
the
back
way
along
the
fields
and
through
the
as
i
generally
did
go
afy
came
out
all
reserve
as
she
could
be
at
times
and
said
she
was
unable
to
receive
me
then
that
i
must
go
back
home
we
had
a
few
words
about
it
and
as
we
were
speaking
locksley
passed
and
saw
me
with
the
gun
in
my
hand
but
it
ended
in
my
giving
way
she
could
do
just
what
she
liked
with
me
for
i
loved
the
very
ground
she
trod
on
i
gave
her
the
gun
telling
her
it
was
loaded
and
she
took
it
indoors
shutting
me
out
i
did
not
go
away
i
had
a
suspicion
that
she
had
got
thorn
there
though
she
denied
it
to
me
and
i
hid
myself
in
some
trees
near
the
house
again
locksley
came
in
view
and
saw
me
there
and
called
out
to
know
why
i
was
hiding
i
shied
further
off
and
did
not
answer
him
what
were
my
private
movements
to
him
and
that
also
told
against
me
at
the
inquest
not
long
afterwards
twenty
minutes
perhaps
i
heard
a
shot
which
seemed
to
be
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
somebody
having
a
late
pop
at
the
partridges
thought
i
for
the
sun
was
then
setting
and
at
the
moment
i
saw
bethel
emerge
from
the
trees
and
run
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
that
was
the
shot
that
killed
there
was
a
pause
carlyle
looked
keenly
at
richard
there
in
the
moonlight
very
soon
almost
in
the
same
moment
as
it
seemed
some
one
came
panting
and
tearing
along
the
path
leading
from
the
cottage
it
was
thorn
his
appearance
startled
me
i
had
never
seen
a
man
show
more
utter
terror
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
seemed
starting
and
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
had
i
been
a
strong
man
i
should
surely
have
attacked
him
i
was
mad
with
jealousy
for
i
then
saw
that
afy
had
sent
me
away
that
she
might
entertain
i
thought
you
said
this
thorn
never
came
but
at
dusk
observed
carlyle
i
never
knew
him
to
do
so
until
that
evening
all
i
can
say
is
he
was
there
then
he
flew
along
swiftly
and
i
afterwards
heard
the
sound
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
galloping
away
i
wondered
what
was
up
that
he
should
look
so
scared
and
scutter
away
as
though
the
deuce
was
after
him
i
wondered
whether
he
had
quarreled
with
afy
i
ran
to
the
house
leaped
up
the
two
steps
and
carlyle
i
fell
over
the
prostrate
body
of
hallijohn
he
was
lying
just
within
on
the
kitchen
floor
dead
blood
was
round
about
him
and
my
gun
just
discharged
was
thrown
near
he
had
been
shot
in
the
richard
stopped
for
breath
carlyle
did
not
speak
i
called
to
afy
no
one
answered
no
one
was
in
the
lower
room
and
it
seemed
that
no
one
was
in
the
upper
a
sort
of
panic
came
over
me
a
fear
you
know
they
always
said
at
home
i
was
a
coward
i
could
not
have
remained
another
minute
with
that
dead
man
had
it
been
to
save
my
own
life
i
caught
up
the
gun
and
was
making
off
when
why
did
you
catch
up
the
gun
interrupted
carlyle
ideas
pass
through
our
minds
quicker
than
we
can
speak
them
especially
in
these
sorts
of
moments
was
the
reply
of
richard
hare
some
vague
notion
flashed
on
my
brain
that
my
gun
ought
not
to
be
found
near
the
murdered
body
of
hallijohn
i
was
flying
from
the
door
i
say
when
locksley
emerged
from
the
wood
full
in
view
and
what
possessed
me
i
can
t
tell
but
i
did
the
worst
thing
i
could
do
flung
the
gun
indoors
again
and
got
away
although
locksley
called
after
me
to
nothing
told
against
you
so
much
as
that
observed
carlyle
locksley
deposed
that
he
had
seen
you
leave
the
cottage
gun
in
hand
apparently
in
great
commotion
that
the
moment
you
saw
him
you
hesitated
as
from
fear
flung
back
the
gun
and
richard
stamped
his
foot
aye
and
all
owing
to
my
cursed
cowardice
they
had
better
have
made
a
woman
of
me
and
brought
me
up
in
petticoats
but
let
me
go
on
i
came
upon
bethel
he
was
standing
in
that
where
the
trees
have
been
cut
now
i
knew
that
bethel
if
he
had
gone
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
must
have
met
thorn
quitting
it
did
you
encounter
that
hound
i
asked
him
what
hound
returned
bethel
that
fine
fellow
that
thorn
who
comes
after
afy
i
answered
for
i
did
not
mind
mentioning
her
name
in
my
passion
i
don
t
know
any
thorn
returned
bethel
and
i
did
not
know
anybody
was
after
afy
but
did
you
hear
a
shot
i
went
on
yes
i
did
he
replied
i
suppose
it
was
locksley
for
he
s
about
this
evening
and
i
saw
you
i
continued
just
at
the
moment
the
shot
was
fired
turn
round
the
corner
in
the
direction
of
hallijohn
so
i
did
he
said
but
only
to
strike
into
the
wood
a
few
paces
up
what
s
your
drift
did
you
not
encounter
thorn
running
from
the
cottage
i
persisted
i
have
encountered
no
one
he
said
and
i
don
t
believe
anybody
s
about
but
ourselves
and
i
quitted
him
and
came
off
concluded
richard
hare
he
evidently
had
not
seen
thorn
and
knew
and
you
decamped
the
same
night
richard
it
was
a
fatal
yes
i
was
a
fool
i
thought
i
d
wait
quiet
and
see
how
things
turned
out
but
you
don
t
know
all
three
or
four
hours
later
i
went
to
the
cottage
again
and
i
managed
to
get
a
minute
s
speech
with
afy
i
never
shall
forget
it
before
i
could
say
one
syllable
she
flew
out
at
me
accusing
me
of
being
the
murderer
of
her
father
and
she
fell
into
hysterics
out
there
on
the
grass
the
noise
brought
people
from
the
house
plenty
were
in
it
then
and
i
retreated
if
she
can
think
me
guilty
the
world
will
think
me
guilty
was
my
argument
and
that
night
i
went
right
off
to
stop
in
hiding
for
a
day
or
two
till
i
saw
my
way
clear
it
never
came
clear
the
coroner
s
inquest
sat
and
the
verdict
floored
me
over
and
afy
but
i
won
t
curse
her
fanned
the
flame
against
me
by
denying
that
any
one
had
been
there
that
night
she
had
been
at
home
she
said
and
had
strolled
out
at
the
back
door
to
the
path
that
led
from
west
lynne
and
was
lingering
there
when
she
heard
a
shot
five
minutes
afterward
she
returned
to
the
house
and
found
locksley
standing
over
her
dead
carlyle
remained
silent
rapidly
running
over
in
his
mind
the
chief
points
of
richard
hare
s
communication
four
of
you
as
i
understand
it
were
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cottage
that
night
and
from
one
or
the
other
the
shot
no
doubt
proceeded
you
were
at
a
distance
you
say
richard
bethel
also
could
not
have
been
it
was
not
bethel
who
did
it
interrupted
richard
it
was
an
impossibility
i
saw
him
as
i
tell
you
in
the
same
moment
that
the
gun
was
but
now
where
was
locksley
it
is
equally
impossible
that
it
could
have
been
locksley
he
was
within
my
view
at
the
same
time
at
right
angles
from
me
deep
in
the
wood
away
from
the
paths
altogether
it
was
thorn
did
the
deed
beyond
all
doubt
and
the
verdict
ought
to
have
been
willful
murder
against
him
carlyle
i
see
you
don
t
believe
my
what
you
say
has
startled
me
and
i
must
take
time
to
consider
whether
i
believe
it
or
not
said
carlyle
in
his
straightforward
manner
the
most
singular
thing
is
if
you
witnessed
this
thorn
s
running
from
the
cottage
in
the
manner
you
describe
that
you
did
not
come
forward
and
denounce
i
didn
t
do
it
because
i
was
a
fool
a
weak
coward
as
i
have
been
all
my
life
rejoined
richard
i
can
t
help
it
it
was
born
with
me
and
will
go
with
me
to
my
grave
what
would
my
word
have
availed
that
it
was
thorn
when
there
was
nobody
to
corroborate
it
and
the
discharged
gun
mine
was
a
damnatory
proof
against
another
thing
strikes
me
as
curious
cried
carlyle
if
this
man
thorn
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
west
lynne
evening
after
evening
how
was
it
that
he
never
was
observed
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
any
stranger
s
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
affair
or
with
thorn
chose
and
he
never
came
save
that
once
but
at
dusk
and
dark
it
was
evident
to
me
at
the
time
that
he
was
striving
to
do
it
on
the
secret
i
told
afy
so
and
that
it
augured
no
good
for
her
you
are
not
attaching
credit
to
what
i
say
and
it
is
only
as
i
expected
nevertheless
i
swear
that
i
have
related
the
facts
as
surely
as
that
we
i
thorn
afy
and
hallijohn
must
one
day
meet
together
before
our
maker
i
have
told
you
the
the
words
were
solemn
their
tone
earnest
and
carlyle
remained
silent
his
thoughts
full
to
what
end
else
should
i
say
this
went
on
richard
it
can
do
me
no
service
all
the
assertion
i
could
put
forth
would
not
go
a
jot
toward
clearing
no
it
would
not
assented
carlyle
if
ever
you
are
cleared
it
must
be
by
proofs
but
i
will
keep
my
thought
on
the
matter
and
should
anything
arise
what
sort
of
a
man
was
this
thorn
in
age
he
might
be
three
or
four
and
twenty
tall
and
slender
an
and
his
connections
where
did
he
live
i
never
knew
afy
in
her
boasting
way
would
say
he
had
come
from
swainson
a
ten
mile
from
swainson
quickly
interrupted
carlyle
could
it
be
one
of
the
thorns
of
swainson
none
of
the
thorns
that
i
know
he
was
a
totally
different
sort
of
man
with
his
perfumed
hands
and
his
rings
and
his
dainty
gloves
that
he
was
an
aristocrat
i
believe
but
of
bad
taste
and
style
displaying
a
profusion
of
a
half
smile
flitted
over
carlyle
s
face
was
it
real
richard
it
was
he
would
wear
diamond
diamond
rings
diamond
pins
brilliants
all
of
the
first
water
my
impression
was
that
he
put
them
on
to
dazzle
afy
she
told
me
once
that
she
could
be
a
grander
lady
if
she
chose
than
i
could
ever
make
her
a
lady
on
the
cross
i
answered
but
never
on
the
thorn
was
not
a
man
to
entertain
honest
intentions
to
one
in
the
station
of
afy
hallijohn
but
girls
are
simple
as
by
your
description
it
could
not
have
been
one
of
the
thorns
of
swainson
wealthy
tradesmen
fathers
of
young
families
short
stout
and
heavy
as
dutchmen
staid
and
most
respectable
very
unlikely
men
are
they
to
run
into
an
expedition
of
that
what
expedition
questioned
richard
the
murder
the
riding
after
afy
richard
where
is
afy
richard
hare
lifted
his
eyes
in
surprise
how
should
i
know
i
was
just
going
to
ask
carlyle
paused
he
thought
richard
s
answer
an
evasive
one
she
disappeared
immediately
after
the
funeral
and
it
was
thought
in
short
richard
the
neighborhood
gave
her
credit
for
having
gone
after
and
joined
no
did
they
what
a
pack
of
idiots
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
of
her
carlyle
since
that
unfortunate
night
if
she
went
after
anybody
it
was
after
was
the
man
i
suppose
the
world
would
call
him
so
afy
thought
such
an
adonis
had
never
been
coined
out
of
fable
he
had
shiny
black
hair
and
whiskers
dark
eyes
and
handsome
features
but
his
vain
dandyism
spoilt
him
would
you
believe
that
his
handkerchiefs
were
soaked
in
scent
they
were
of
the
finest
cambric
silky
as
a
hair
as
fine
as
the
one
barbara
bought
at
lynneborough
and
gave
a
guinea
for
only
hers
had
a
wreath
of
embroidery
around
carlyle
could
ascertain
no
more
particulars
and
it
was
time
richard
went
indoors
they
proceeded
up
the
path
what
a
blessing
it
is
the
servants
windows
don
t
look
this
way
shivered
richard
treading
on
carlyle
s
heels
if
they
should
be
looking
out
upstairs
his
apprehensions
were
groundless
and
he
entered
unseen
carlyle
s
part
was
over
he
left
the
poor
banned
exile
to
his
short
interview
with
his
hysterical
and
tearful
mother
richard
nearly
as
hysterical
as
she
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
again
pondering
over
what
he
had
heard
the
magistrates
made
a
good
evening
of
it
carlyle
entertained
them
to
supper
mutton
chops
and
bread
and
cheese
they
took
up
their
pipes
for
another
whiff
when
the
meal
was
over
but
miss
carlyle
retired
to
bed
the
smoke
to
which
she
had
not
been
accustomed
since
her
father
s
death
had
made
her
head
ache
and
her
eyes
smart
about
eleven
they
wished
carlyle
and
departed
but
dill
in
obedience
to
a
nod
from
his
superior
remained
sit
down
a
moment
dill
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
you
are
intimate
with
the
thorns
of
swainson
do
they
happen
to
have
any
relative
a
nephew
or
cousin
perhaps
a
dandy
young
fellow
i
went
over
last
sunday
fortnight
to
spend
the
day
with
young
jacob
was
the
answer
of
dill
one
wider
from
the
point
than
he
generally
gave
carlyle
smiled
young
jacob
he
must
be
forty
i
about
that
but
you
and
i
estimate
age
differently
archibald
they
have
no
nephew
the
old
man
never
had
but
those
two
children
jacob
and
edward
neither
have
they
any
cousin
rich
men
they
are
growing
now
jacob
has
set
up
his
carlyle
mused
but
he
expected
the
answer
for
neither
had
he
heard
of
the
brothers
thorn
tanners
curriers
and
possessing
a
relative
of
the
name
dill
said
he
something
has
arisen
which
in
my
mind
casts
a
doubt
upon
richard
hare
s
guilt
i
question
whether
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
dill
opened
his
eyes
but
his
flight
archibald
and
his
stopping
away
suspicious
circumstances
i
grant
still
i
have
good
cause
to
doubt
at
the
time
it
happened
some
dandy
fellow
used
to
come
courting
afy
hallijohn
in
secret
a
tall
slender
man
as
he
is
described
to
me
bearing
the
name
of
thorn
and
living
at
swainson
could
it
have
been
one
of
the
thorn
family
mr
archibald
remonstrated
the
old
clerk
as
if
those
two
respected
gentlemen
with
their
wives
and
babies
would
come
sneaking
after
that
flyaway
afy
no
reflection
on
them
returned
carlyle
this
was
a
young
man
three
or
four
and
twenty
a
head
taller
than
either
i
thought
it
might
be
a
i
have
repeatedly
heard
them
say
that
they
are
alone
in
the
world
that
they
are
the
two
last
of
the
name
depend
upon
it
it
was
nobody
connected
with
them
and
wishing
carlyle
he
departed
the
servant
came
in
to
remove
the
glasses
and
the
obnoxious
pipes
carlyle
sat
in
a
brown
study
presently
he
looked
round
at
the
man
is
joyce
gone
to
bed
no
sir
she
is
just
send
her
here
when
you
have
taken
away
those
joyce
came
in
the
upper
servant
at
miss
carlyle
s
she
was
of
middle
height
and
would
never
see
five
and
thirty
again
her
forehead
was
broad
her
gray
eyes
were
deeply
set
and
her
face
was
pale
altogether
she
was
plain
but
she
was
the
of
afy
hallijohn
shut
the
door
joyce
did
as
she
was
bid
came
forward
and
stood
by
the
table
have
you
ever
heard
from
your
sister
joyce
began
carlyle
somewhat
abruptly
no
sir
was
the
reply
i
think
it
would
be
a
wonder
if
i
did
why
so
if
she
would
go
off
after
richard
hare
who
had
sent
her
father
into
his
grave
she
would
be
more
likely
to
hide
herself
and
her
doings
than
to
proclaim
them
to
me
who
was
that
other
that
fine
gentleman
who
came
after
her
the
color
mantled
in
joyce
s
cheeks
and
she
dropped
her
voice
sir
did
you
hear
of
him
not
at
that
time
since
he
came
from
swainson
did
he
not
i
believe
so
sir
afy
never
would
say
much
about
him
we
did
not
agree
upon
the
point
i
said
a
person
of
his
rank
would
do
her
no
good
and
afy
flew
out
when
i
spoke
against
carlyle
caught
her
up
his
rank
what
was
his
rank
afy
bragged
of
his
being
next
door
to
a
lord
and
he
looked
like
it
i
only
saw
him
once
i
had
gone
home
early
and
there
sat
him
and
afy
his
white
hands
were
all
glittering
with
rings
and
his
shirt
was
finished
off
with
shining
stones
where
the
buttons
ought
to
have
you
seen
him
since
never
since
never
but
once
and
i
don
t
think
i
should
know
him
if
i
did
see
him
he
got
up
sir
as
soon
as
i
went
into
the
parlor
shook
hands
with
afy
and
left
a
fine
upright
man
he
was
nearly
as
tall
as
you
sir
but
very
slim
those
soldiers
always
carry
themselves
how
do
you
know
he
was
a
soldier
quickly
rejoined
carlyle
afy
told
me
so
the
captain
she
used
to
call
him
but
she
said
he
was
not
a
captain
yet
awhile
the
next
grade
to
it
a
a
lieutenant
suggested
carlyle
yes
sir
that
was
it
lieutenant
joyce
said
carlyle
has
it
never
struck
you
that
afy
is
more
likely
to
have
followed
lieutenant
thorn
than
richard
hare
no
sir
answered
joyce
i
have
felt
certain
always
that
she
is
with
richard
hare
and
nothing
can
turn
me
from
the
belief
all
west
lynne
is
convinced
of
carlyle
did
not
attempt
to
turn
her
from
her
he
dismissed
her
and
sat
on
still
revolving
the
case
in
all
its
bearings
richard
hare
s
short
interview
with
his
mother
had
soon
terminated
it
lasted
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
both
dreading
interruptions
from
the
servants
and
with
a
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
and
desolation
in
his
heart
the
young
man
once
more
quitted
his
childhood
s
home
hare
and
barbara
watched
him
steal
down
the
path
in
the
telltale
moonlight
and
gain
the
road
both
feeling
that
those
farewell
kisses
they
had
pressed
upon
his
lips
would
not
be
renewed
for
years
and
might
not
be
forever
chapter
vii
miss
carlyle
at
home
the
church
clocks
at
west
lynne
struck
eight
one
lovely
morning
in
july
and
then
the
bells
chimed
out
giving
token
that
it
was
sunday
east
lynne
had
changed
owners
and
now
it
was
the
property
of
carlyle
he
had
bought
it
as
it
stood
furniture
and
all
but
the
transfer
had
been
conducted
with
secrecy
and
was
suspected
by
none
save
those
engaged
in
the
negotiations
whether
lord
mount
severn
thought
it
might
prevent
any
one
getting
on
the
scent
or
whether
he
wished
to
take
farewell
of
a
place
he
had
formerly
been
fond
of
certain
it
is
that
he
craved
a
week
or
two
s
visit
to
it
carlyle
most
readily
and
graciously
acquiesced
and
the
earl
his
daughter
and
retinue
had
arrived
the
previous
day
west
lynne
was
in
ecstacies
it
called
itself
an
aristocratic
place
and
it
indulged
hopes
that
the
earl
might
be
intending
to
confer
permanently
the
light
of
his
presence
by
taking
up
his
residence
again
at
east
lynne
the
toilettes
prepared
to
meet
his
admiring
eyes
were
prodigious
and
pretty
barbara
hare
was
not
the
only
young
lady
who
had
thereby
to
encounter
the
paternal
storm
miss
carlyle
was
ready
for
church
at
the
usual
time
plainly
but
well
dressed
as
she
and
archibald
were
leaving
their
house
they
saw
something
looming
up
the
street
flashing
and
gleaming
in
the
sun
a
pink
parasol
came
first
a
pink
bonnet
and
feather
came
behind
it
a
gray
brocaded
dress
and
white
gloves
the
vain
little
idiot
ejaculated
miss
carlyle
but
barbara
smiled
up
the
street
toward
them
unconscious
of
the
apostrophe
well
done
barbara
was
the
salutation
of
miss
carlyle
the
justice
might
well
call
out
you
are
finer
than
a
sunbeam
not
half
so
fine
as
many
another
in
the
church
will
be
responded
barbara
as
she
lifted
her
shy
blue
eyes
and
blushing
face
to
answer
the
greetings
of
carlyle
west
lynne
seems
bent
on
dressing
the
lady
isabel
you
should
have
been
at
the
milliner
s
yesterday
morning
miss
is
all
the
finery
coming
out
gravely
inquired
carlyle
as
barbara
turned
with
them
toward
the
church
and
he
walked
by
her
side
and
his
sister
s
for
he
had
an
objection
almost
invincible
as
a
frenchman
s
to
give
his
arm
to
two
ladies
of
course
replied
barbara
first
impression
is
everything
you
know
and
the
earl
and
his
daughter
will
be
coming
to
suppose
she
should
not
be
in
peacock
s
plumes
cried
miss
carlyle
with
an
imperturbable
face
oh
but
she
is
sure
to
be
if
you
mean
richly
dressed
cried
barbara
hastily
or
suppose
they
should
not
come
to
church
laughed
carlyle
what
a
disappointment
to
the
bonnets
and
feathers
after
all
barbara
what
are
they
to
us
or
we
to
them
resumed
miss
carlyle
we
may
never
meet
we
insignificant
west
lynne
gentry
shall
not
obtrude
ourselves
into
east
lynne
it
would
scarcely
be
fitting
or
be
deemed
so
by
the
earl
and
lady
that
s
just
how
papa
went
on
grumbled
barbara
he
caught
sight
of
this
bonnet
yesterday
and
when
by
way
of
excuse
i
said
i
had
it
to
call
on
them
he
asked
whether
i
thought
the
obscure
west
lynne
families
would
venture
to
thrust
their
calls
on
lord
mount
severn
as
though
they
were
of
the
county
aristocracy
it
was
the
feather
that
put
him
it
is
a
very
long
one
remarked
miss
carlyle
grimly
surveying
it
barbara
was
to
sit
in
the
carlyle
pew
that
day
for
she
thought
the
farther
she
was
from
the
justice
the
better
there
was
no
knowing
but
he
might
take
a
sly
revengeful
cut
at
the
feather
in
the
middle
of
service
and
so
dock
its
beauty
scarcely
were
they
seated
when
some
strangers
came
quietly
up
the
aisle
a
gentleman
who
limped
as
he
walked
with
a
furrowed
brow
and
gray
hair
and
a
young
lady
barbara
looked
round
with
eagerness
but
looked
away
again
they
could
not
be
the
expected
strangers
the
young
lady
s
dress
was
too
plain
a
muslin
dress
for
a
hot
summer
s
day
but
the
old
beadle
in
his
coat
was
walking
before
them
sideways
with
his
marshalling
baton
and
he
marshaled
them
into
the
east
lynne
pew
unoccupied
for
so
many
years
who
in
the
world
can
they
be
whispered
barbara
to
miss
carlyle
that
old
stupid
is
always
making
a
mistake
and
putting
people
into
the
wrong
the
earl
and
lady
the
color
flushed
into
barbara
s
face
and
she
stared
at
miss
corny
why
she
has
no
silks
and
no
feathers
and
no
anything
cried
barbara
she
s
plainer
than
anybody
in
the
church
plainer
than
any
of
the
fine
ones
than
you
for
instance
the
earl
is
much
altered
but
i
should
have
known
them
both
anywhere
i
should
have
known
her
from
the
likeness
to
her
poor
mother
just
the
same
eyes
and
sweet
aye
those
brown
eyes
so
full
of
sweetness
and
melancholy
few
who
had
once
seen
could
mistake
or
forget
them
and
barbara
hare
forgetting
where
she
was
looked
at
them
much
that
day
she
is
very
lovely
thought
barbara
and
her
dress
is
certainly
that
of
a
lady
i
wish
i
had
not
had
this
streaming
pink
feather
what
fine
jackdaws
she
must
deem
us
all
the
earl
s
carriage
an
open
barouche
was
waiting
at
the
gate
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
he
handed
his
daughter
in
and
was
putting
his
gouty
foot
upon
the
step
to
follow
her
when
he
observed
carlyle
the
earl
turned
and
held
out
his
hand
a
man
who
could
purchase
east
lynne
was
worthy
of
being
received
as
an
equal
though
he
was
but
a
country
lawyer
carlyle
shook
hands
with
the
earl
approached
the
carriage
and
raised
his
hat
to
lady
isabel
she
bent
forward
with
her
pleasant
smile
and
put
her
hand
into
his
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
you
said
the
earl
i
wish
you
would
go
home
with
us
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
be
east
lynne
s
guest
for
the
remainder
of
the
he
smiled
peculiarly
as
he
spoke
and
carlyle
echoed
it
east
lynne
s
guest
that
is
what
the
earl
was
at
present
carlyle
turned
aside
to
tell
his
sister
cornelia
i
shall
not
be
home
to
dinner
i
am
going
with
lord
mount
severn
carlyle
stepped
into
the
carriage
was
followed
by
the
earl
and
it
drove
away
the
sun
shone
still
but
the
day
s
brightness
had
gone
out
for
barbara
hare
how
does
he
know
the
earl
so
well
how
does
he
know
lady
isabel
she
reiterated
in
her
astonishment
archibald
knows
something
of
most
people
replied
miss
corny
he
saw
the
earl
frequently
when
he
was
in
town
in
the
spring
and
lady
isabel
once
or
twice
what
a
lovely
face
hers
is
barbara
made
no
reply
she
returned
home
with
miss
carlyle
but
her
manner
was
as
absent
as
her
heart
and
that
had
run
away
to
east
lynne
chapter
viii
kane
s
concert
before
lord
mount
severn
had
completed
the
fortnight
of
his
proposed
stay
the
gout
came
on
seriously
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
move
away
from
east
lynne
carlyle
assured
him
he
was
only
too
pleased
that
he
should
remain
as
long
as
might
be
convenient
and
the
earl
expressed
his
acknowledgments
he
hoped
soon
to
be
on
his
legs
but
he
was
not
the
gout
came
and
the
gout
went
not
positively
laying
him
up
in
bed
but
rendering
him
unable
to
leave
his
rooms
and
this
continued
until
october
when
he
grew
much
better
the
county
families
had
been
neighborly
calling
on
the
invalid
earl
and
occasionally
carrying
off
lady
isabel
but
his
chief
and
constant
visitor
had
been
carlyle
the
earl
had
grown
to
like
him
in
no
common
degree
and
was
disappointed
if
carlyle
spent
an
evening
away
from
him
so
that
he
became
as
it
were
quite
domesticated
with
the
earl
and
isabel
i
am
not
quite
equal
to
general
society
he
observed
to
his
daughter
and
it
is
considerate
and
kind
of
carlyle
to
come
here
and
cheer
my
extremely
kind
said
isabel
i
like
him
very
much
i
don
t
know
anybody
that
i
like
half
as
well
was
the
rejoinder
of
the
earl
carlyle
went
up
as
usual
the
same
evening
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
earl
asked
isabel
to
sing
i
will
if
you
wish
papa
was
the
reply
but
the
piano
is
so
much
out
of
tune
that
it
is
not
pleasant
to
sing
to
it
is
there
any
one
in
west
lynne
who
could
come
here
and
tune
my
piano
carlyle
she
added
turning
to
him
certainly
there
is
kane
would
do
it
shall
i
send
him
i
should
be
glad
if
it
would
not
be
giving
you
too
much
trouble
not
that
tuning
will
benefit
it
greatly
old
thing
that
it
is
were
we
to
be
much
at
east
lynne
i
should
get
papa
to
exchange
it
for
a
good
little
thought
lady
isabel
that
that
very
piano
was
carlyle
s
and
not
hers
the
earl
coughed
and
exchanged
a
smile
and
a
glance
with
his
guest
kane
was
the
organist
of
jude
s
church
a
man
of
embarrassment
and
sorrow
who
had
long
had
a
sore
fight
with
the
world
when
he
arrived
at
east
lynne
the
following
day
dispatched
by
carlyle
lady
isabel
happened
to
be
playing
and
she
stood
by
and
watched
him
begin
his
work
she
was
courteous
and
affable
she
was
so
to
every
one
and
the
poor
music
master
took
courage
to
speak
of
his
own
affairs
and
to
prefer
a
humble
request
that
she
and
lord
mount
severn
would
patronize
and
personally
attend
a
concert
he
was
about
to
give
the
following
week
a
scarlet
blush
came
into
his
thin
cheeks
as
he
confessed
that
he
was
very
poor
could
scarcely
live
and
he
was
getting
up
this
concert
in
his
desperate
need
if
it
succeeded
well
he
could
then
go
on
again
if
not
he
should
be
turned
out
of
his
home
and
his
furniture
sold
for
the
two
years
rent
he
owed
and
he
had
seven
children
isabel
all
her
sympathies
awakened
sought
the
earl
oh
papa
i
have
to
ask
you
the
greatest
favor
will
you
grant
it
ay
child
you
don
t
ask
them
often
what
is
it
i
want
you
to
take
me
to
a
concert
at
west
the
earl
fell
back
in
surprise
and
stared
at
isabel
a
concert
at
west
lynne
he
laughed
to
hear
the
rustics
scraping
the
fiddle
my
dear
isabel
she
poured
out
what
she
had
just
heard
with
her
own
comments
and
additions
seven
children
papa
and
if
the
concert
does
not
succeed
he
must
give
up
his
home
and
turn
out
into
the
streets
with
them
it
is
you
see
almost
a
matter
of
life
or
death
with
him
he
is
very
i
am
poor
myself
said
the
earl
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
when
he
was
speaking
he
kept
turning
red
and
white
and
catching
up
his
breath
in
agitation
it
was
painful
to
him
to
tell
of
his
embarrassments
i
am
sure
he
is
a
well
you
may
take
a
pound
s
worth
of
tickets
isabel
and
give
them
to
the
upper
servants
a
village
concert
oh
papa
it
is
not
can
t
you
see
it
is
not
if
we
you
and
i
will
promise
to
be
present
all
the
families
round
west
lynne
will
attend
and
he
will
have
the
room
full
they
will
go
because
we
do
he
said
so
make
a
sacrifice
for
once
dearest
papa
and
go
if
it
be
only
for
an
hour
i
shall
enjoy
it
if
there
s
nothing
but
a
fiddle
and
a
you
gipsy
you
are
as
bad
as
a
professional
beggar
there
go
and
tell
the
fellow
we
will
look
in
for
half
an
she
flew
back
to
kane
her
eyes
dancing
she
spoke
quietly
as
she
always
did
but
her
own
satisfaction
gladdened
her
voice
i
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
papa
has
consented
he
will
take
four
tickets
and
we
will
attend
the
the
tears
rushed
into
kane
s
eyes
isabel
was
not
sure
but
they
were
in
her
own
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
long
white
fingers
and
a
long
neck
he
faltered
forth
his
thanks
with
an
inquiry
whether
he
might
be
allowed
to
state
openly
that
they
would
be
present
tell
everybody
said
she
eagerly
everybody
you
come
across
if
as
you
think
it
will
be
the
means
of
inducing
people
to
attend
i
shall
tell
all
friends
who
call
upon
me
and
ask
them
to
when
carlyle
came
up
in
the
evening
the
earl
was
temporarily
absent
from
the
room
isabel
began
to
speak
of
the
concert
it
is
a
hazardous
venture
for
kane
observed
carlyle
i
fear
he
will
only
lose
money
and
add
to
his
why
do
you
fear
that
she
asked
because
lady
isabel
nothing
gets
patronized
at
west
lynne
nothing
native
and
people
have
heard
so
long
of
poor
kane
s
necessities
that
they
think
little
of
is
he
so
very
poor
very
he
is
starved
half
his
starved
repeated
isabel
an
expression
of
perplexity
arising
to
her
face
as
she
looked
at
carlyle
for
she
scarcely
understood
him
do
you
mean
that
he
does
not
have
enough
to
eat
of
bread
he
may
but
not
much
better
nourishment
his
salary
as
organist
is
thirty
pounds
and
he
gets
a
little
stray
teaching
but
he
has
his
wife
and
children
to
keep
and
no
doubt
serves
them
before
himself
i
dare
say
he
scarcely
knows
what
it
is
to
taste
the
words
brought
a
bitter
pang
to
lady
isabel
not
enough
to
eat
never
to
taste
meat
and
she
in
her
carelessness
her
ignorance
her
indifference
she
scarcely
knew
what
term
to
give
not
thought
to
order
him
a
meal
in
their
house
of
plenty
he
had
walked
from
west
lynne
occupied
himself
an
hour
with
her
piano
and
set
off
to
walk
back
again
battling
with
his
hunger
a
word
from
her
and
a
repast
had
been
set
before
him
out
of
their
superfluities
such
as
he
never
sat
down
to
and
that
word
she
had
not
spoken
you
are
looking
grave
lady
i
m
taking
contrition
to
myself
never
mind
it
can
not
now
be
helped
but
it
will
always
be
a
dark
spot
on
my
what
is
it
she
lifted
her
repentant
face
to
his
and
smiled
never
mind
i
say
carlyle
what
is
past
can
not
be
recalled
he
looks
like
a
who
kane
a
gentleman
bred
his
father
was
a
clergyman
kane
s
ruin
was
his
love
of
music
it
prevented
his
settling
to
any
better
paid
profession
his
early
marriage
also
was
a
drawback
and
kept
him
down
he
is
young
mr
carlyle
i
would
not
be
one
of
your
west
lynne
people
for
the
world
here
is
a
young
gentleman
struggling
with
adversity
and
you
won
t
put
out
your
hand
to
help
him
he
smiled
at
her
warmth
some
of
us
will
take
tickets
i
for
one
but
i
don
t
know
about
attending
the
concert
i
fear
few
would
do
because
that
s
just
the
thing
that
would
serve
him
if
one
went
another
would
well
i
shall
try
and
show
west
lynne
that
i
don
t
take
a
lesson
from
their
book
i
shall
be
there
before
it
begins
and
never
come
out
till
the
last
song
s
over
i
am
not
too
grand
to
go
if
west
lynne
you
surely
do
not
think
of
going
i
surely
do
think
of
it
and
papa
goes
with
me
i
persuaded
him
and
i
have
given
kane
the
carlyle
paused
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
will
be
a
perfect
boon
to
kane
if
it
once
gets
abroad
that
lord
mount
severn
and
lady
isabel
intend
to
honor
the
concert
there
won
t
be
standing
she
danced
round
with
a
little
gleeful
step
what
high
and
mighty
personages
lord
mount
severn
and
lady
isabel
seem
to
be
if
you
had
any
goodness
of
heart
carlyle
you
would
enlist
yourself
in
the
cause
i
think
i
will
he
smiled
papa
says
you
hold
sway
at
west
lynne
if
you
proclaim
that
you
mean
to
go
you
will
induce
i
will
proclaim
that
you
do
he
answered
that
will
be
all
sufficient
but
lady
isabel
you
must
not
expect
much
gratification
from
the
a
tambourine
will
be
quite
enough
for
me
i
told
papa
so
i
shan
t
think
of
music
i
shall
think
of
poor
kane
carlyle
i
know
you
can
be
kind
if
you
like
i
know
you
would
rather
be
kind
than
is
to
be
read
in
your
face
try
and
do
what
you
can
for
yes
i
will
he
warmly
answered
carlyle
sold
no
end
of
tickets
the
following
day
or
rather
caused
them
to
be
sold
he
praised
up
the
concert
far
and
wide
and
proclaimed
that
lord
mount
severn
and
his
daughter
would
not
think
of
missing
it
kane
s
house
was
besieged
for
tickets
faster
than
he
could
write
his
signature
in
their
corner
and
when
carlyle
went
home
to
luncheon
at
midday
which
he
did
not
often
do
he
laid
down
two
at
miss
corny
s
elbow
what
s
this
concert
tickets
archibald
you
have
never
gone
and
bought
these
what
would
she
have
said
had
she
known
that
the
two
were
not
the
extent
of
his
investment
ten
shillings
to
throw
away
upon
two
paltry
bits
of
cardboard
chafed
miss
carlyle
you
always
were
a
noodle
in
money
matters
archibald
and
always
will
be
i
wish
i
had
the
keeping
of
your
purse
what
i
have
given
will
not
hurt
me
cornelia
and
kane
is
badly
off
think
of
his
troop
of
oh
dear
said
miss
corny
i
imagine
he
should
think
of
them
i
suppose
it
was
his
own
fault
they
came
that
s
always
it
poor
folks
get
a
heap
of
children
about
them
and
then
ask
for
pity
i
should
say
it
would
be
more
just
if
they
asked
for
well
there
the
tickets
are
bought
and
paid
for
so
they
may
as
well
be
used
you
will
go
with
me
and
stick
ourselves
there
upon
empty
benches
like
two
geese
and
sit
staring
and
counting
the
candles
a
pleasant
evening
you
need
not
fear
empty
benches
the
mount
severns
are
going
and
west
lynne
is
in
a
fever
racing
after
tickets
i
suppose
you
have
got
a
a
cap
looking
at
the
nondescript
article
decorating
his
sister
s
head
that
will
be
suitable
to
go
in
cornelia
if
not
you
had
better
order
this
suggestion
put
up
miss
carlyle
hadn
t
you
better
have
your
hair
curled
and
your
coat
tails
lined
with
white
satin
and
a
gold
glass
and
a
cocked
hat
retorted
she
my
gracious
me
a
fine
new
cap
to
go
to
their
mess
of
a
concert
in
after
paying
ten
shillings
for
the
tickets
the
world
s
coming
to
carlyle
left
her
and
her
grumbling
to
return
to
the
office
lord
mount
severn
s
carriage
was
passing
at
the
moment
and
isabel
vane
was
within
it
she
caused
it
to
stop
when
she
saw
carlyle
and
he
advanced
to
her
i
have
been
to
kane
s
myself
for
the
tickets
said
she
with
a
beaming
look
i
came
into
west
lynne
on
purpose
i
told
the
coachman
to
find
out
where
he
lived
and
he
did
i
thought
if
the
people
saw
me
and
the
carriage
there
they
would
guess
what
i
wanted
i
do
hope
he
will
have
a
full
i
am
sure
he
will
replied
carlyle
as
he
released
her
hand
and
lady
isabel
signed
to
the
carriage
to
drive
on
as
carlyle
turned
away
he
met
otway
bethel
a
nephew
of
colonel
bethel
s
who
was
tolerated
in
the
colonel
s
house
because
he
had
no
other
home
and
appeared
incapable
to
making
himself
one
some
persons
persisted
in
calling
him
a
gentleman
as
he
was
by
birth
others
a
mauvais
sujet
the
two
are
united
sometimes
he
was
dressed
in
a
velveteen
suit
and
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
indeed
he
was
rarely
seen
without
a
gun
being
inordinately
fond
of
sport
but
if
all
tales
whispered
were
true
he
supplied
himself
with
game
in
other
ways
than
by
shooting
which
had
the
credit
of
going
up
to
london
dealers
for
the
last
six
months
or
near
upon
it
he
had
been
away
from
west
lynne
why
where
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
exclaimed
carlyle
the
colonel
has
been
come
no
gammon
carlyle
i
have
been
on
the
tramp
through
france
and
germany
man
likes
a
change
sometimes
as
to
the
revered
colonel
he
would
not
be
inconsolable
if
he
saw
me
nailed
up
in
a
box
and
carried
out
feet
bethel
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you
continued
carlyle
dropping
his
light
manner
and
his
voice
together
take
your
thoughts
back
to
the
night
of
hallijohn
s
i
wish
you
may
get
it
cried
bethel
the
reminiscence
is
not
you
ll
do
it
quietly
said
carlyle
it
has
been
told
me
though
it
did
not
appear
at
the
inquest
that
richard
hare
held
a
conversation
with
you
in
the
wood
a
few
minutes
after
the
deed
was
done
now
who
told
you
that
interrupted
bethel
that
is
not
the
question
my
authority
is
it
is
true
that
he
did
i
said
nothing
about
it
for
i
did
not
want
to
make
the
case
worse
against
dick
hare
than
it
already
was
he
certainly
did
accost
me
like
a
man
flurried
out
of
his
asking
if
you
had
seen
a
certain
lover
of
afy
s
fly
from
the
cottage
one
that
was
the
purport
thorn
thorn
i
think
thorn
was
the
name
he
mentioned
my
opinion
was
that
dick
was
either
wild
or
acting
a
now
bethel
i
want
you
to
answer
me
truly
the
question
can
not
affect
you
either
way
but
i
must
know
whether
you
did
see
this
thorn
leave
the
bethel
shook
his
head
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
any
thorn
and
i
saw
nobody
but
dick
hare
not
but
what
a
dozen
thorns
might
have
run
from
the
cottage
without
my
seeing
you
heard
the
shot
fired
yes
but
i
never
gave
a
thought
to
mischief
i
knew
locksley
was
in
the
wood
and
supposed
it
came
from
him
i
ran
across
the
path
bearing
toward
the
cottage
and
struck
into
the
wood
on
the
other
side
by
and
by
dick
hare
pitched
upon
me
like
one
startled
out
of
his
seven
senses
and
asked
if
i
had
seen
thorn
leave
the
cottage
thorn
that
was
the
and
you
had
not
i
had
seen
nobody
but
dick
excepting
locksley
my
impression
was
that
nobody
else
was
about
i
think
so
but
richard
now
look
you
here
carlyle
i
won
t
do
dick
hare
an
injury
even
by
a
single
word
if
i
can
help
it
and
it
is
of
no
use
setting
me
on
to
i
should
be
the
last
to
set
you
on
to
injure
any
one
especially
richard
hare
rejoined
carlyle
and
my
motive
is
to
do
richard
hare
good
not
harm
i
hold
a
suspicion
no
matter
whence
gathered
that
it
was
not
richard
hare
who
committed
the
murder
but
another
can
you
throw
any
light
upon
the
subject
no
i
can
t
i
have
always
thought
poor
wavering
dick
was
nobody
s
enemy
but
his
own
but
as
to
throwing
any
light
on
that
night
s
work
i
can
t
do
it
cords
should
not
have
dragged
me
to
the
inquest
to
give
evidence
against
dick
and
for
that
reason
i
was
glad
locksley
never
let
out
that
i
was
on
the
spot
how
the
deuce
it
got
about
afterward
that
i
was
i
can
t
tell
but
that
was
no
matter
my
evidence
did
not
help
on
the
verdict
and
talking
of
that
carlyle
how
has
it
come
to
your
knowledge
that
richard
hare
accosted
me
i
have
not
opened
my
lips
upon
it
to
mortal
it
is
of
no
consequence
now
repeated
carlyle
i
do
know
it
and
that
is
sufficient
i
was
in
hopes
you
had
really
seen
this
man
thorn
leave
the
otway
bethel
shook
his
head
i
should
not
lay
too
much
stress
upon
any
thorns
having
been
there
were
i
you
carlyle
dick
hare
was
as
one
crazy
that
night
and
might
see
shapes
and
forms
where
there
were
chapter
ix
the
song
and
the
dirge
the
concert
was
to
take
place
on
thursday
and
on
the
following
saturday
lord
mount
severn
intended
finally
to
quit
east
lynne
the
necessary
preparations
for
departure
were
in
progress
but
when
thursday
morning
dawned
it
appeared
a
question
whether
they
would
not
once
more
be
rendered
nugatory
the
house
was
roused
betimes
and
wainwright
the
surgeon
from
west
lynne
summoned
to
the
earl
s
bedside
he
had
experienced
another
and
a
violent
attack
the
peer
was
exceedingly
annoyed
and
vexed
and
very
irritable
i
may
be
kept
here
a
week
a
month
a
fortnight
a
month
longer
now
he
uttered
fretfully
to
isabel
i
am
very
sorry
papa
i
dare
say
you
do
find
east
lynne
dull
that
s
not
it
i
have
other
reasons
for
wishing
east
lynne
to
be
quit
of
us
and
now
you
can
t
go
to
the
isabel
s
face
flushed
not
go
papa
why
who
is
to
take
you
i
can
t
get
out
of
oh
papa
i
must
be
there
otherwise
it
would
like
almost
as
though
as
though
we
had
announced
what
we
did
not
mean
to
perform
you
know
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
join
the
ducies
the
carriage
can
still
take
me
to
the
concert
room
and
i
can
go
in
with
just
as
you
please
i
thought
you
would
have
jumped
at
any
plea
for
staying
not
at
all
laughed
isabel
i
should
like
west
lynne
to
see
that
i
don
t
despise
kane
and
his
later
in
the
day
the
earl
grew
alarmingly
worse
his
paroxysms
of
pain
were
awful
isabel
who
was
kept
from
the
room
knew
nothing
of
the
danger
and
the
earl
s
groans
did
not
penetrate
to
her
ears
she
dressed
herself
in
a
gleeful
mode
full
of
laughing
willfulness
marvel
her
maid
superintending
in
stiff
displeasure
for
the
attire
chosen
did
not
meet
her
approbation
when
ready
she
went
into
the
earl
s
room
shall
i
do
papa
lord
mount
severn
raised
his
swollen
eyelids
and
drew
the
clothes
from
his
flushed
face
a
shining
vision
was
standing
before
him
a
beauteous
queen
a
gleaming
fairy
he
hardly
knew
what
she
looked
like
she
had
put
on
a
white
lace
hat
and
her
diamonds
the
dress
was
rich
and
the
jewels
gleamed
from
her
delicate
arms
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
curls
were
flowing
the
earl
stared
at
her
in
amazement
how
could
you
dress
yourself
off
like
that
for
a
concert
you
are
out
of
yours
senses
marvel
thinks
so
too
was
the
gay
answer
she
has
had
a
cross
face
since
i
told
her
what
to
put
on
but
i
did
it
on
purpose
papa
i
thought
i
would
show
those
west
lynne
people
that
i
think
the
poor
man
s
moment
worth
going
to
and
worth
dressing
you
will
have
the
whole
room
gaping
at
i
don
t
mind
i
ll
bring
you
word
all
about
it
let
them
you
vain
child
you
have
so
dressed
yourself
to
please
your
vanity
but
isabel
you
oooh
isabel
started
as
she
stood
the
earl
s
groan
of
pain
was
dreadful
an
awful
twinge
child
there
go
along
talking
makes
me
papa
shall
i
stay
at
home
with
you
she
gravely
asked
every
consideration
should
give
way
to
illness
if
you
would
like
me
to
remain
or
if
i
can
do
any
good
pray
let
quite
the
contrary
i
had
rather
you
were
away
you
can
do
no
earthly
good
for
i
could
not
have
you
in
the
room
darling
if
you
see
carlyle
tell
him
i
shall
hope
to
see
him
the
room
was
partly
full
when
ducie
her
two
daughters
and
lady
isabel
entered
and
were
conducted
to
seats
by
kane
seats
he
had
reserved
for
them
at
the
upper
end
near
the
orchestra
the
same
dazzling
vision
which
had
burst
on
the
sight
of
lord
mount
severn
fell
on
that
of
the
audience
in
isabel
with
her
rich
white
dress
her
glittering
diamonds
her
flowing
curls
and
her
wondrous
beauty
the
misses
ducie
plain
girls
in
brown
silks
turned
up
their
noses
worse
than
nature
had
done
it
for
them
and
ducie
heaved
an
audible
sigh
the
poor
motherless
girl
is
to
be
pitied
my
dears
she
whispered
she
has
nobody
to
point
out
to
her
suitable
attire
this
ridiculous
decking
out
must
have
been
marvel
s
but
she
looked
like
a
lily
among
poppies
and
sunflowers
whether
the
decking
out
was
ridiculous
or
not
was
lord
mount
severn
right
when
he
accused
her
of
dressing
so
in
very
likely
for
has
not
the
great
preacher
said
that
childhood
and
youth
are
vanity
miss
carlyle
the
justice
and
barbara
also
had
seats
near
the
orchestra
for
miss
carlyle
in
west
lynne
was
a
person
to
be
considered
and
not
hidden
behind
others
carlyle
however
preferred
to
join
the
gentlemen
who
congregated
and
stood
round
about
the
door
inside
and
out
there
was
scarcely
standing
room
in
the
place
kane
had
as
was
anticipated
got
a
bumper
and
the
poor
man
could
have
worshipped
lady
isabel
for
he
knew
he
owed
it
to
her
it
was
very
long
country
concerts
generally
are
and
was
about
three
parts
over
when
a
powdered
head
larger
than
any
cauliflower
ever
grown
was
discerned
ascending
the
stairs
behind
the
group
of
gentlemen
which
head
when
it
brought
its
body
in
full
view
was
discovered
to
belong
to
one
of
the
footmen
of
lord
mount
severn
the
calves
alone
cased
in
their
silk
stockings
were
a
sight
to
be
seen
and
these
calves
betook
themselves
inside
the
concert
room
with
a
deprecatory
bow
for
permission
to
the
gentlemen
they
had
to
steer
through
and
there
they
came
to
a
standstill
the
cauliflower
extending
forward
and
turning
itself
about
from
right
to
left
well
i
ll
be
jiffled
cried
an
astonished
old
who
had
been
elbowed
by
the
footman
the
cheek
these
fellows
have
the
fellow
in
question
did
not
appear
however
to
be
enjoying
any
great
amount
of
cheek
just
at
that
moment
for
he
looked
perplexed
humble
and
uneasy
suddenly
his
eye
fell
upon
carlyle
and
it
lighted
up
beg
pardon
sir
could
you
happen
to
inform
me
my
young
lady
is
sitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
near
the
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
however
i
am
to
get
to
her
then
returned
the
man
more
in
than
to
carlyle
the
room
is
choke
full
and
i
don
t
like
crushing
by
my
lord
is
taken
alarmingly
worse
sir
he
explained
in
an
tone
it
is
feared
he
is
carlyle
was
painfully
startled
his
screams
of
pain
were
awful
sir
wainwright
and
another
doctor
from
west
lynne
are
with
him
and
an
express
has
gone
to
lynneboro
for
physicians
mason
said
we
were
to
fetch
my
young
lady
right
home
and
not
lose
a
moment
and
we
brought
the
carriage
sir
wells
galloping
his
horses
all
the
i
will
bring
lady
isabel
said
carlyle
i
am
sure
sir
i
should
be
under
everlasting
obligations
if
you
would
returned
the
man
he
worked
his
way
through
the
concert
room
he
was
tall
and
slender
many
looking
daggers
at
him
for
a
pathetic
song
was
just
then
being
given
by
a
london
lady
he
disregarded
all
and
stood
before
isabel
i
thought
you
were
not
coming
to
speak
to
me
is
it
not
a
famous
room
i
am
so
pleased
more
than
famous
lady
isabel
choosing
his
words
that
they
might
not
alarm
her
lord
mount
severn
does
not
find
himself
so
well
and
he
has
sent
the
carriage
for
papa
not
so
well
she
quickly
exclaimed
not
quite
at
any
rate
he
wishes
you
to
go
home
will
you
allow
me
to
pilot
you
through
the
room
oh
my
dear
considerate
papa
she
laughed
he
fears
i
shall
be
weary
and
would
emancipate
me
before
the
time
thank
you
carlyle
but
i
will
wait
till
the
no
no
lady
isabel
it
is
not
that
lord
mount
severn
is
indeed
her
countenance
changed
to
seriousness
but
she
was
not
alarmed
very
well
when
the
song
is
over
not
to
disturb
the
i
think
you
had
better
lose
no
time
he
urged
never
mind
the
song
and
the
she
rose
instantly
and
put
her
arm
within
carlyle
s
a
hasty
word
of
explanation
to
ducie
and
he
led
her
away
the
room
in
its
surprise
making
for
them
what
space
it
might
many
an
eye
followed
them
but
none
more
curiously
and
eagerly
than
barbara
hare
s
where
is
he
going
to
take
her
to
involuntarily
uttered
barbara
how
should
i
know
returned
miss
corny
barbara
you
have
done
nothing
but
fidget
all
the
night
what
s
the
matter
with
you
folks
come
to
a
concert
to
listen
not
to
talk
and
isabel
s
mantle
was
procured
from
the
where
it
had
been
left
and
she
descended
the
stairs
with
carlyle
the
carriage
was
drawn
up
close
to
the
entrance
and
the
coachman
had
his
reins
gathered
ready
to
start
the
footman
not
the
one
who
had
gone
upstairs
threw
open
the
carriage
door
as
he
saw
her
he
was
new
in
the
service
a
simple
country
native
just
engaged
she
withdrew
her
arm
from
carlyle
s
and
stood
a
moment
before
stepping
in
looking
at
the
man
is
papa
much
worse
oh
yes
my
lady
he
was
screaming
shocking
but
they
think
he
ll
live
till
with
a
sharp
cry
she
seized
the
arm
of
carlyle
seized
it
for
support
in
her
shock
of
agony
carlyle
rudely
thrust
the
man
away
he
would
willingly
have
flung
him
at
full
length
on
the
pavement
oh
carlyle
why
did
you
not
tell
me
she
shivered
my
dear
lady
isabel
i
am
grieved
that
you
are
told
now
but
take
comfort
you
know
how
ill
he
frequently
is
and
this
may
be
but
an
ordinary
attack
step
in
i
trust
we
shall
find
it
nothing
are
you
going
home
with
me
certainly
i
shall
not
leave
you
to
go
she
moved
to
the
other
side
of
the
chariot
making
room
for
him
thank
you
i
will
sit
but
the
night
is
oh
he
closed
the
door
and
took
his
seat
by
the
coachman
the
footman
got
up
behind
and
the
carriage
sped
away
isabel
gathered
herself
into
her
corner
and
moaned
aloud
in
her
suspense
and
helplessness
the
coachman
drove
rapidly
and
soon
whipped
his
horses
through
the
the
housekeeper
mason
waited
at
the
to
receive
lady
isabel
carlyle
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage
and
gave
her
his
arm
up
the
steps
she
scarcely
dared
to
inquire
is
he
better
may
i
go
to
his
room
she
panted
yes
the
earl
was
better
better
in
so
far
as
that
he
was
quiet
and
senseless
she
moved
hastily
toward
his
chamber
carlyle
drew
the
housekeeper
aside
is
there
any
hope
not
the
slightest
sir
he
is
the
earl
knew
no
one
pain
was
gone
for
the
present
and
he
lay
on
his
bed
calm
but
his
face
which
had
death
in
it
all
too
plainly
startled
isabel
she
did
not
scream
or
cry
she
was
perfectly
quiet
save
that
she
had
a
fit
of
shivering
will
he
soon
be
better
she
whispered
to
wainwright
who
stood
there
the
surgeon
coughed
well
he
he
we
must
hope
it
my
but
why
does
his
face
look
like
that
it
is
pale
gray
i
never
saw
anybody
else
look
he
has
been
in
great
pain
my
lady
and
pain
leaves
its
traces
on
the
carlyle
who
had
come
and
was
standing
by
the
surgeon
touched
his
arm
to
draw
him
from
the
room
he
noticed
the
look
on
the
earl
s
face
and
did
not
like
it
he
wished
to
question
the
surgeon
lady
isabel
saw
that
carlyle
was
about
to
quit
the
room
and
beckoned
to
him
do
not
leave
the
house
carlyle
when
he
wakes
up
it
may
cheer
him
to
see
you
here
he
liked
you
very
i
will
not
leave
it
lady
isabel
i
did
not
think
of
doing
in
time
it
seemed
an
age
the
medical
men
arrived
from
lynneborough
three
of
them
the
groom
had
thought
he
could
not
summon
too
many
it
was
a
strange
scene
they
entered
upon
the
ghastly
peer
growing
restless
again
now
battling
with
his
departing
spirit
and
the
gala
robes
the
sparkling
gems
adorning
the
young
girl
watching
at
his
side
they
comprehended
the
case
without
difficulty
that
she
had
been
suddenly
called
from
some
scene
of
gayety
they
stooped
to
look
at
the
earl
and
felt
his
pulse
and
touched
his
heart
and
exchanged
a
few
murmured
words
with
wainwright
isabel
had
stood
back
to
give
them
place
but
her
anxious
eyes
followed
their
every
movement
they
did
not
seem
to
notice
her
and
she
stepped
forward
can
you
do
anything
for
him
will
he
recover
they
all
turned
at
the
address
and
looked
at
her
one
spoke
it
was
an
evasive
answer
tell
me
the
truth
she
implored
with
feverish
impatience
you
must
not
trifle
with
me
do
you
not
know
me
i
am
his
only
child
and
i
am
here
the
first
thing
was
to
get
her
away
from
the
room
for
the
great
change
was
approaching
and
the
parting
struggle
between
the
body
and
the
spirit
might
be
one
of
warfare
no
sight
for
her
but
in
answer
to
their
suggestion
that
she
should
go
she
only
leaned
her
head
upon
the
pillow
by
her
father
and
moaned
in
despair
she
must
be
got
out
of
the
room
cried
one
of
the
physicians
almost
angrily
ma
am
turning
suddenly
upon
mason
are
there
no
reserves
in
the
house
no
one
who
can
exert
influence
over
the
young
lady
she
has
scarcely
any
relatives
in
the
world
replied
the
housekeeper
no
near
ones
and
we
happen
to
be
just
now
quite
but
carlyle
seeing
the
urgency
of
the
case
for
the
earl
with
every
minute
grew
more
excited
approached
and
whispered
her
you
are
as
anxious
as
we
can
be
for
your
father
s
recovery
as
anxious
she
uttered
reproachfully
you
know
what
i
would
imply
of
course
our
anxiety
can
be
as
nothing
to
as
nothing
as
nothing
i
think
my
heart
will
then
forgive
me
you
should
not
oppose
the
wishes
of
his
medical
attendants
they
wish
to
be
alone
with
him
and
time
is
being
she
rose
up
she
placed
her
hands
on
her
brow
as
if
to
collect
the
sense
of
the
words
and
then
she
addressed
the
doctors
is
it
really
necessary
that
i
should
leave
the
room
necessary
for
him
it
is
necessary
my
lady
absolutely
she
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
sobs
as
carlyle
lead
her
to
another
apartment
he
is
my
dear
father
i
have
but
him
in
the
wide
world
she
exclaimed
i
know
i
know
i
feel
for
you
all
that
you
are
feeling
twenty
times
this
night
i
have
wished
forgive
me
the
thought
that
you
were
my
sister
so
that
i
might
express
my
sympathy
more
freely
and
comfort
tell
me
the
truth
then
why
i
am
kept
away
if
you
can
show
me
sufficient
cause
i
will
be
reasonable
and
obey
but
do
not
say
again
i
should
be
disturbing
him
for
it
is
not
he
is
too
ill
for
you
to
see
him
his
symptoms
are
too
painful
in
fact
it
would
not
be
proper
and
were
you
to
go
in
in
defiance
of
advice
you
would
regret
it
all
your
after
is
he
dying
carlyle
hesitated
ought
he
to
dissemble
with
her
as
the
doctors
had
done
a
strong
feeling
was
upon
him
that
he
ought
not
i
trust
to
you
not
to
deceive
me
she
simply
said
i
fear
he
is
i
believe
he
she
rose
up
she
grasped
his
arm
in
the
sudden
fear
that
flashed
over
her
you
are
deceiving
me
and
he
is
dead
i
am
not
deceiving
you
lady
isabel
he
is
not
dead
but
it
may
be
very
she
laid
her
face
down
upon
the
soft
pillow
going
forever
from
me
going
forever
oh
carlyle
let
me
see
him
for
a
minute
just
one
farewell
will
you
not
try
for
me
he
knew
how
hopeless
it
was
but
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
i
will
go
and
see
but
you
will
remain
here
quietly
you
will
not
she
bowed
her
head
in
acquiescence
and
he
closed
the
door
had
she
indeed
been
his
sister
he
would
probably
have
turned
the
key
upon
her
he
entered
the
earl
s
chamber
but
not
many
seconds
did
he
remain
in
it
it
is
over
he
whispered
to
mason
whom
he
met
in
the
corridor
and
wainwright
is
asking
for
you
are
soon
back
cried
isabel
lifting
her
head
may
i
go
he
sat
down
and
took
her
hand
shrinking
from
his
task
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
her
face
turned
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
as
white
as
another
s
not
far
away
tell
me
the
worst
she
breathed
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
but
the
worst
may
god
support
you
dear
lady
isabel
she
turned
to
hide
her
face
and
its
misery
away
from
him
and
a
low
wail
of
anguish
broke
from
her
telling
its
own
tale
of
despair
the
gray
dawn
of
morning
was
breaking
over
the
world
advent
of
another
bustling
day
in
life
s
history
but
the
spirit
of
william
vane
earl
of
mount
severn
had
soared
away
from
it
forever
chapter
x
the
keepers
of
the
dead
events
between
the
death
of
lord
mount
severn
and
his
interment
occurred
quickly
and
to
one
of
them
the
reader
may
feel
inclined
to
demur
as
believing
that
it
could
have
no
foundation
in
fact
in
the
actions
of
real
life
but
must
be
a
wild
creation
of
the
author
s
brain
he
would
be
wrong
the
author
is
no
more
fond
of
wild
creations
than
the
reader
the
circumstance
did
take
place
the
earl
died
on
friday
morning
at
daylight
the
news
spread
rapidly
it
generally
does
on
the
death
of
a
peer
if
he
has
been
of
note
whether
good
or
bad
in
the
world
and
was
known
in
london
before
the
day
was
over
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
by
saturday
morning
early
a
shoal
of
what
the
late
peer
would
have
called
harpies
had
arrived
to
surround
east
lynne
there
were
creditors
of
all
sorts
for
small
sums
and
for
great
for
five
or
ten
pounds
up
to
five
or
ten
thousand
some
were
civil
some
impatient
some
loud
and
rough
and
angry
some
came
to
put
in
executions
on
the
effects
and
some
to
arrest
the
body
this
last
act
was
accomplished
cleverly
two
men
each
with
a
remarkably
hooked
nose
stole
away
from
the
hubbub
of
the
clamorous
and
peering
cunningly
about
made
their
way
to
the
side
or
tradesman
s
entrance
a
answered
their
gentle
appeal
at
the
bell
is
the
coffin
come
yet
said
they
coffin
no
was
the
girl
s
reply
the
shell
ain
t
here
yet
jones
didn
t
promise
that
till
nine
o
clock
and
it
haven
t
gone
it
won
t
be
long
quoth
they
its
on
its
road
we
ll
go
up
to
his
lordship
s
room
please
and
be
getting
ready
for
the
girl
called
the
butler
two
men
from
jones
the
undertaker
s
sir
announced
she
the
shell
s
coming
on
and
they
want
to
go
up
and
make
ready
for
the
butler
marshaled
them
upstairs
himself
and
introduced
them
to
the
room
that
will
do
said
they
as
he
was
about
to
enter
with
them
we
won
t
trouble
you
to
and
closing
the
door
upon
the
unsuspicious
butler
they
took
up
their
station
on
either
side
of
the
dead
like
a
couple
of
mutes
they
had
placed
an
arrest
upon
the
corpse
it
was
theirs
until
their
claim
was
satisfied
and
they
sat
down
to
thus
watch
and
secure
it
pleasant
occupation
it
may
have
been
an
hour
later
that
lady
isabel
leaving
her
own
chamber
opened
noiselessly
that
of
the
dead
she
had
been
in
it
several
times
during
the
previous
day
at
first
with
the
housekeeper
afterward
when
the
nameless
dread
was
somewhat
effaced
alone
but
she
felt
nervous
again
this
morning
and
had
gained
the
bed
before
she
ventured
to
lift
her
eyes
from
the
carpet
and
encounter
the
sight
then
she
started
for
there
sat
two
men
and
not
attractive
men
either
it
darted
through
her
mind
that
they
must
be
people
from
the
neighborhood
come
to
gratify
an
idle
and
unpardonable
curiosity
her
first
impulse
was
to
summon
the
butler
her
second
to
speak
to
them
herself
do
you
want
anything
here
she
quietly
said
much
obleeged
for
the
inquiry
miss
we
are
all
the
words
and
tone
struck
her
as
being
singular
in
the
extreme
and
they
kept
their
seats
too
as
though
they
had
a
right
to
be
there
why
are
you
here
she
repeated
what
are
you
doing
well
miss
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
for
i
suppose
you
are
his
daughter
pointing
his
left
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
the
late
peer
and
we
hear
he
have
got
no
other
relative
anigh
him
we
have
been
obleeged
miss
to
perform
an
unpleasant
dooty
and
secure
the
words
were
like
greek
to
her
and
the
men
saw
that
they
were
he
unfortunately
owed
a
slight
amount
of
money
miss
as
you
perhaps
be
aware
on
and
our
employers
is
in
deep
so
as
soon
as
they
heard
what
had
happened
they
sent
us
down
to
arrest
the
dead
corpse
and
we
have
done
amazement
horror
fear
struggled
together
in
the
shocked
mind
of
lady
isabel
arrest
the
dead
she
had
never
heard
of
a
like
calamity
nor
could
she
have
believed
in
such
arrest
it
for
what
purpose
what
to
do
to
disfigure
it
to
sell
it
with
a
panting
heart
and
ashy
lips
she
turned
from
the
room
mason
happened
to
be
passing
near
the
stairs
and
isabel
flew
to
her
laying
hold
of
her
with
both
hands
in
her
terror
as
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
nervous
tears
those
men
in
there
she
gasped
what
men
my
lady
returned
mason
surprised
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
i
think
they
are
going
to
stop
there
they
say
they
have
taken
after
a
pause
of
bewildered
astonishment
the
housekeeper
left
her
standing
where
she
was
and
went
to
the
earl
s
chamber
to
see
if
she
could
fathom
the
mystery
of
the
words
isabel
leaned
against
the
balustrades
partly
for
support
partly
that
she
seemed
afraid
to
stir
from
them
and
the
ominous
disturbances
downstairs
reached
her
ears
strangers
interlopers
appeared
to
be
in
the
hall
talking
vehemently
and
complaining
in
bitter
tones
more
and
more
terrified
she
held
her
breath
to
listen
where
s
the
good
of
your
seeing
the
young
lady
cried
the
butler
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
she
knows
nothing
about
the
earl
s
affairs
she
is
in
grief
enough
just
now
without
any
other
i
will
see
her
returned
a
dogged
voice
if
she
s
too
and
mighty
to
come
down
and
answer
a
question
or
two
why
i
ll
find
my
way
on
to
her
here
we
are
a
shameful
crowd
of
us
swindled
out
of
our
own
told
there
s
nobody
we
can
speak
to
nobody
here
but
the
young
lady
and
she
must
not
be
troubled
she
didn
t
find
it
trouble
to
help
to
spend
our
money
she
has
got
no
honor
and
feelings
of
a
lady
if
she
don
t
come
and
speak
to
us
repressing
her
rebellious
emotions
lady
isabel
glided
partly
down
the
staircase
and
softy
called
to
the
butler
what
is
all
this
she
asked
i
must
oh
my
lady
don
t
go
amongst
those
rough
men
you
can
t
do
any
good
pray
go
back
before
they
see
you
i
have
sent
for
carlyle
and
expect
him
here
did
papa
owe
them
all
money
she
said
shivering
i
m
afraid
he
did
my
she
went
swiftly
on
and
passing
through
the
few
stragglers
in
the
hall
entered
the
where
the
chief
mass
had
congregated
and
the
hubbub
was
loudest
all
anger
at
least
external
anger
was
hushed
at
her
sight
she
looked
so
young
so
innocent
so
childlike
in
her
pretty
morning
dress
of
muslin
her
fair
face
shaded
by
its
falling
curls
so
little
fit
to
combat
with
or
understand
their
business
that
instead
of
pouring
forth
complaints
they
hushed
them
into
silence
i
heard
some
one
calling
out
that
i
ought
to
see
you
she
began
her
agitation
causing
the
words
to
come
forth
in
a
jerking
manner
what
did
you
want
with
me
then
they
poured
forth
their
complaints
but
not
angrily
and
she
listened
till
she
grew
sick
there
were
many
and
formidable
claims
promissory
notes
and
i
o
us
overdue
bills
and
underdue
bills
heavy
outstanding
debts
of
all
sorts
and
trifles
comparatively
speaking
for
housekeeping
servants
liveries
servants
wages
bread
and
meat
what
was
isabel
vane
to
answer
what
excuse
to
offer
what
hope
or
promise
to
give
she
stood
in
bewilderment
unable
to
speak
turning
from
one
to
the
other
her
sweet
eyes
full
of
pity
and
contrition
the
fact
is
young
lady
spoke
up
one
who
bore
the
exterior
of
a
gentleman
we
should
not
have
come
down
troubling
you
at
least
i
can
answer
for
myself
but
his
lordship
s
men
of
business
warburton
ware
to
whom
many
of
us
hastened
last
evening
told
us
there
would
not
be
a
shilling
for
anybody
unless
it
could
be
got
from
furniture
when
it
comes
to
that
it
is
first
come
first
served
and
i
got
down
by
morning
light
and
levied
an
which
was
levied
before
you
came
put
in
a
man
who
might
be
brother
to
the
two
upstairs
to
judge
by
his
nose
but
what
s
such
furniture
as
this
to
our
claims
if
you
come
to
combine
em
no
more
than
a
bucket
of
water
is
to
the
what
can
i
do
shivered
lady
isabel
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
i
have
no
money
to
give
you
i
no
miss
broke
in
a
quiet
pale
man
if
report
tells
me
you
are
worse
wronged
than
we
are
for
you
won
t
have
a
roof
to
put
your
head
under
or
a
guinea
to
call
your
he
has
been
a
scoundrel
to
everybody
interrupted
an
intemperate
voice
he
has
ruined
the
speech
was
hissed
down
even
they
were
not
men
gratuitously
to
insult
a
delicate
young
lady
perhaps
you
ll
just
answer
us
a
question
miss
persisted
the
voice
in
spite
of
the
hisses
is
there
any
ready
money
that
can
but
another
person
had
entered
the
room
carlyle
he
caught
sight
of
the
white
face
and
trembling
hands
of
isabel
and
interrupted
the
last
speaker
with
scant
ceremony
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
demanded
in
a
tone
of
authority
what
do
you
want
if
you
are
a
friend
of
the
late
peer
s
you
ought
to
know
what
we
want
was
the
response
we
want
our
debts
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
come
to
returned
carlyle
your
coming
here
flocking
in
this
extraordinary
manner
will
do
no
good
you
must
go
to
warburton
we
have
been
to
them
and
received
their
answer
a
cool
assurance
that
there
ll
be
nothing
for
at
any
rate
you
ll
get
nothing
here
observed
carlyle
to
the
assembly
collectively
allow
me
to
request
that
you
leave
the
house
at
it
was
little
likely
that
they
would
for
him
and
they
said
it
then
i
warn
you
of
the
consequences
of
a
refusal
quietly
said
carlyle
you
are
trespassing
upon
a
stranger
s
property
this
house
is
not
lord
mount
severn
s
he
sold
it
some
time
they
knew
better
some
laughed
and
said
these
tricks
were
stale
listen
gentlemen
rejoined
carlyle
in
the
plain
straightforward
manner
that
carried
its
own
truth
to
make
an
assertion
that
could
be
disproved
when
the
earl
s
affairs
come
to
be
investigated
would
be
simply
foolish
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
nay
as
a
that
this
estate
with
the
house
and
all
it
contains
passed
months
ago
from
the
hands
of
lord
mount
severn
and
during
his
recent
sojourn
here
he
was
a
visitor
in
it
go
and
ask
his
men
of
who
purchased
it
was
the
inquiry
mr
carlyle
of
west
lynne
some
of
you
may
possibly
know
him
by
some
of
them
did
a
cute
young
lawyer
observed
a
voice
as
his
father
was
before
i
am
he
proceeded
carlyle
and
being
a
cute
lawyer
as
you
do
me
the
honor
to
decide
you
can
not
suppose
i
should
risk
my
money
upon
any
sale
not
perfectly
safe
and
legal
i
was
not
an
agent
in
the
affair
i
employed
agents
for
it
was
my
own
money
that
i
invested
and
east
lynne
is
is
the
purchase
money
paid
over
inquired
more
than
one
it
was
paid
over
at
the
time
last
what
did
lord
mount
severn
do
with
the
money
i
do
not
know
replied
carlyle
i
am
not
cognizant
of
lord
mount
severn
s
private
significant
murmurs
arose
strange
that
the
earl
should
stop
two
or
three
months
at
a
place
that
wasn
t
it
may
appear
so
to
you
but
allow
me
to
explain
returned
carlyle
the
earl
expressed
a
wish
to
pay
east
lynne
a
few
days
visit
by
way
of
farewell
and
i
acceded
before
the
few
days
were
over
he
was
taken
ill
and
remained
from
that
time
too
ill
to
quit
it
this
very
day
this
day
gentlemen
as
we
stand
here
was
at
length
fixed
for
his
and
you
tell
us
you
bought
the
furniture
everything
as
it
stands
you
need
not
doubt
my
word
for
the
proofs
will
be
forthcoming
east
lynne
was
in
the
market
for
sale
i
heard
of
it
and
became
the
purchaser
just
as
i
might
have
bought
an
estate
from
any
of
you
and
now
as
this
is
my
house
and
you
have
no
claim
upon
me
i
shall
be
obliged
to
you
to
perhaps
you
ll
claim
the
horses
and
carriages
next
sir
cried
the
man
with
the
hooked
nose
carlyle
raised
his
head
haughtily
what
is
mine
is
mine
legally
purchased
and
paid
for
a
fair
just
price
the
carriages
and
horses
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
lord
mount
severn
brought
them
down
with
and
i
have
got
a
safe
watcher
over
them
in
the
out
premises
to
see
as
they
don
t
run
away
nodded
the
man
complacently
and
if
i
don
t
mistake
there
s
a
safe
watcher
over
something
else
what
a
cursed
scoundrel
mount
severn
whatever
he
may
have
been
it
does
not
give
you
the
right
to
outrage
the
feelings
of
his
daughter
warmly
interrupted
carlyle
and
i
should
have
thought
that
men
calling
themselves
englishmen
would
have
disdained
the
shame
allow
me
lady
isabel
he
added
imperatively
taking
her
hand
to
lead
her
from
the
room
i
will
remain
and
deal
with
this
but
she
hesitated
and
stopped
the
injury
her
father
had
done
these
men
was
telling
painfully
on
her
sense
of
right
and
she
essayed
to
speak
a
word
of
apology
of
sorrow
she
thought
she
ought
to
do
so
she
did
not
like
them
to
deem
her
quite
heartless
but
it
was
a
painful
task
and
the
color
went
and
came
in
her
pale
face
and
her
breath
was
labored
with
the
excess
of
her
tribulation
i
am
very
sorry
she
stammered
and
with
the
effort
of
speaking
emotion
quite
got
the
better
of
her
and
she
burst
into
tears
i
did
not
know
anything
of
all
this
my
father
s
affairs
were
not
spoken
of
before
me
i
believe
i
have
not
anything
if
i
had
i
would
divide
it
amongst
you
as
equally
as
i
could
but
should
the
means
ever
be
in
my
power
should
money
ever
be
mine
i
will
thankfully
pay
all
your
all
your
claims
lady
isabel
little
thought
what
that
all
would
comprise
however
such
promises
made
at
such
a
moment
fell
heedlessly
upon
the
ear
scarcely
one
present
but
felt
sympathy
and
sorrow
for
her
and
carlyle
drew
her
from
the
room
he
closed
the
door
upon
the
noisy
crew
and
then
sobs
came
forth
hysterically
i
am
so
grieved
lady
isabel
had
i
foreseen
this
annoyance
you
should
have
been
spared
it
can
you
go
upstairs
alone
or
shall
i
call
mason
oh
yes
i
can
go
alone
i
am
not
ill
only
frightened
and
sick
this
is
not
the
worst
she
shivered
there
are
two
men
up
up
with
up
with
carlyle
was
puzzled
he
saw
that
she
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
as
she
stood
before
him
i
can
not
understand
it
and
it
terrifies
me
she
continued
attempting
an
explanation
they
are
sitting
in
the
room
close
to
him
they
have
taken
him
they
a
blank
thunderstruck
pause
carlyle
looked
at
her
he
did
not
speak
and
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
butler
who
was
standing
near
but
the
man
only
responded
by
giving
his
head
a
half
shake
and
carlyle
saw
that
it
was
an
ominous
one
i
will
clear
the
house
of
these
he
said
to
lady
isabel
pointing
back
to
the
and
then
join
you
two
ruffians
sir
and
they
have
got
possession
of
the
body
whispered
the
butler
in
carlyle
s
ear
as
lady
isabel
departed
they
obtained
entrance
to
the
chamber
by
a
sly
deceitful
trick
saying
they
were
the
undertaker
s
men
and
that
he
can
t
be
buried
unless
their
claims
are
paid
if
it
s
for
a
month
to
come
it
has
upset
all
our
stomachs
sir
mason
while
telling
me
for
she
was
the
first
one
to
know
it
was
as
sick
as
she
could
at
present
carlyle
returned
to
the
and
bore
the
brunt
of
the
anger
of
those
savage
and
it
may
be
said
men
not
that
it
was
vented
upon
him
quite
the
contrary
but
on
the
memory
of
the
unhappy
peer
who
lay
overhead
a
few
had
taken
the
precaution
to
insure
the
earl
s
life
and
they
were
the
best
off
they
left
the
house
after
a
short
space
of
time
for
carlyle
s
statement
was
indisputable
and
they
knew
the
law
better
than
to
remain
trespassers
on
his
property
but
the
custodians
of
the
dead
could
not
be
got
rid
of
carlyle
proceeded
to
the
and
examined
their
authority
a
similar
case
had
never
occurred
under
his
own
observation
though
it
had
under
his
father
s
and
carlyle
remembered
hearing
of
it
the
body
of
a
church
dignitary
who
had
died
deeply
in
debt
was
arrested
as
it
was
being
carried
through
the
cloisters
to
its
grave
in
the
cathedral
these
men
sitting
over
lord
mount
severn
enforced
heavy
claims
and
there
they
must
sit
until
the
arrival
of
vane
from
castle
marling
now
the
earl
of
mount
severn
on
the
following
morning
sunday
carlyle
proceeded
again
to
east
lynne
and
found
to
his
surprise
that
there
was
no
arrival
isabel
sat
in
the
alone
the
meal
on
the
table
untouched
and
she
shivering
as
it
seemed
on
a
low
ottoman
before
the
fire
she
looked
so
ill
that
carlyle
could
not
forbear
remarking
upon
it
i
have
not
slept
and
i
am
very
cold
she
answered
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
all
night
i
was
so
terrified
at
what
he
asked
at
those
men
she
whispered
it
is
strange
that
vane
has
not
is
the
post
in
i
don
t
know
she
apathetically
replied
i
have
received
she
had
scarcely
spoke
when
the
butler
entered
with
his
salver
full
of
letters
most
of
them
bearing
condolence
with
lady
isabel
she
singled
out
one
and
hastened
to
open
it
for
it
bore
the
castle
marling
mark
it
is
vane
s
handwriting
she
remarked
to
carlyle
castle
marling
saturday
my
dear
isabel
i
am
dreadfully
grieved
and
shocked
at
the
news
conveyed
in
carlyle
s
letter
to
my
husband
for
he
has
gone
cruising
in
his
yacht
and
i
opened
it
goodness
knows
where
he
may
be
round
the
coast
somewhere
but
he
said
he
should
be
home
for
sunday
and
as
he
is
pretty
punctual
in
keeping
his
word
i
expect
him
be
assured
he
will
not
lose
a
moment
in
hastening
to
east
lynne
i
can
not
express
what
i
feel
for
you
and
am
too
bouleversee
to
write
more
try
and
keep
up
your
spirits
and
believe
me
dear
isabel
with
sincere
sympathy
and
regret
faithfully
yours
emma
mount
the
color
came
into
isabel
s
pale
cheek
when
she
read
the
signature
she
thought
had
she
been
the
writer
she
should
in
that
first
early
letter
have
still
signed
herself
emma
vane
isabel
handed
the
note
to
carlyle
it
is
very
unfortunate
she
sighed
carlyle
glanced
over
it
as
quickly
as
vane
s
illegible
writing
allowed
him
and
drew
in
his
lips
in
a
peculiar
manner
when
he
came
to
the
signature
perhaps
at
the
same
thought
which
had
struck
isabel
had
vane
been
worth
a
rush
she
would
have
come
herself
knowing
your
lonely
situation
he
uttered
impulsively
isabel
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
all
the
difficulties
and
embarrassments
of
her
position
came
crowding
on
her
mind
no
orders
had
been
given
in
preparation
for
the
funeral
and
she
felt
that
she
had
no
right
to
give
any
the
earls
of
mount
severn
were
buried
at
mount
severn
but
to
take
her
father
thither
would
involve
great
expense
would
the
present
earl
sanction
that
since
the
previous
morning
she
seemed
to
have
grown
old
in
the
world
s
experience
her
ideas
were
changed
the
bent
of
her
thoughts
had
been
violently
turned
from
its
course
instead
of
being
a
young
lady
of
high
position
of
wealth
and
rank
she
appeared
to
herself
more
in
the
light
of
an
unfortunate
pauper
and
interloper
in
the
house
she
was
inhabiting
it
has
been
the
custom
in
romance
to
present
young
ladies
especially
if
they
be
handsome
and
interesting
as
being
entirely
oblivious
of
cares
and
necessities
supremely
indifferent
to
future
prospects
of
poverty
poverty
that
brings
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
and
nakedness
but
be
assured
this
apathy
never
existed
in
real
life
isabel
vane
s
grief
for
her
father
whom
whatever
may
have
been
the
aspect
he
wore
for
others
she
had
deeply
loved
and
reverenced
was
sharply
poignant
but
in
the
midst
of
that
grief
and
of
the
singular
troubles
his
death
had
brought
forth
she
could
not
shut
her
eyes
to
her
own
future
its
blank
uncertainty
its
embarrassments
did
obtrude
themselves
and
the
words
of
that
creditor
kept
ringing
in
her
ears
you
won
t
have
a
roof
to
put
your
head
under
or
a
guinea
to
call
your
where
was
she
to
go
with
whom
to
live
she
was
in
carlyle
s
house
now
and
how
was
she
to
pay
the
servants
money
was
owing
to
them
all
mr
carlyle
how
long
has
this
house
been
yours
she
asked
breaking
the
silence
it
was
in
june
that
the
purchase
was
completed
did
lord
mount
severn
never
tell
you
he
had
sold
it
to
me
no
never
all
these
things
are
yours
glancing
round
the
room
the
furniture
was
sold
with
the
house
not
these
sort
of
things
he
added
his
eye
falling
on
the
silver
on
the
breakfast
table
not
the
plate
and
not
the
plate
and
linen
then
those
poor
men
who
were
here
yesterday
have
a
right
to
them
she
quickly
cried
i
scarcely
know
i
believe
the
plate
goes
with
the
entail
and
the
jewels
go
also
the
linen
can
not
be
of
consequence
either
are
my
clothes
my
own
he
smiled
as
he
looked
at
her
smiled
at
her
simplicity
and
assured
her
that
they
were
nobody
s
else
i
did
not
know
she
sighed
i
did
not
understand
so
many
strange
things
have
happened
in
the
last
day
or
two
that
i
seem
to
understand
indeed
she
could
not
understand
she
had
no
definite
ideas
on
the
subject
of
this
transfer
of
east
lynne
to
carlyle
plenty
of
indefinite
ones
and
they
were
haunting
her
fears
of
debt
to
him
and
of
the
house
and
its
contents
being
handed
over
to
him
in
liquidation
perhaps
only
partial
were
working
in
her
brain
does
my
father
owe
you
any
money
she
breathed
in
a
timid
tone
not
any
he
replied
lord
mount
severn
was
never
indebted
to
me
in
his
yet
you
purchased
east
lynne
as
any
one
else
might
have
done
he
answered
discerning
the
drift
of
her
thoughts
i
was
in
search
of
an
eligible
estate
to
invest
money
in
and
east
lynne
suited
i
feel
my
position
carlyle
she
resumed
the
rebellious
tears
forcing
themselves
to
her
eyes
thus
to
be
intruding
upon
you
for
a
shelter
and
i
can
not
help
you
can
help
grieving
me
he
gently
answered
which
you
do
much
when
you
talk
of
obligation
the
obligation
is
on
my
side
lady
isabel
and
when
i
express
a
hope
that
you
will
continue
at
east
lynne
while
it
can
be
of
service
however
prolonged
that
period
may
be
i
assure
you
i
say
it
in
all
you
are
very
kind
she
faltered
and
for
a
few
days
until
i
can
think
until
oh
carlyle
are
papa
s
affairs
really
so
bad
as
they
said
yesterday
she
broke
off
her
perplexities
recurring
to
her
with
vehement
force
is
there
nothing
left
now
carlyle
might
have
given
the
evasive
assurance
that
there
would
be
plenty
left
just
to
tranquilize
her
but
to
have
used
deceit
with
her
would
have
pricked
against
every
feeling
of
his
nature
and
he
saw
how
implicitly
she
relied
upon
his
truth
i
fear
things
are
not
very
bright
he
answered
that
is
so
far
as
we
can
see
at
present
but
there
may
have
been
some
settlement
effected
for
you
that
you
do
not
know
of
warburton
ware
no
she
interrupted
i
never
heard
of
a
settlement
and
i
am
sure
there
is
none
i
see
the
worst
plainly
i
have
no
home
no
home
and
no
money
this
house
is
yours
the
town
house
and
mount
severn
go
to
vane
and
i
have
but
surely
vane
will
be
delighted
to
welcome
you
to
your
old
home
the
houses
pass
to
him
it
almost
seems
as
though
you
had
the
greater
right
in
them
than
he
or
my
home
with
them
she
retorted
as
if
the
words
had
stung
her
what
are
you
saying
carlyle
i
beg
your
pardon
lady
isabel
i
should
not
have
presumed
to
touch
upon
these
points
myself
but
nay
i
think
i
ought
to
beg
yours
she
interrupted
more
calmly
i
am
only
grateful
for
the
interest
you
take
in
them
the
kindness
you
have
shown
but
i
could
not
make
my
home
with
carlyle
rose
he
could
do
no
good
by
remaining
and
did
not
think
it
well
to
intrude
longer
he
suggested
that
it
might
be
more
pleasant
if
isabel
had
a
friend
with
her
ducie
would
no
doubt
be
willing
to
come
and
she
was
a
kind
motherly
woman
isabel
shook
her
head
with
a
passing
shudder
have
strangers
here
with
all
that
in
papa
s
chamber
she
uttered
mrs
ducie
drove
over
yesterday
perhaps
to
remain
i
don
t
know
but
i
was
afraid
of
questions
and
would
not
see
her
when
i
think
of
that
i
feel
thankful
that
i
am
the
housekeeper
stopped
carlyle
as
he
was
going
out
sir
what
is
the
news
from
castle
marling
pound
said
there
was
a
letter
is
vane
coming
he
was
out
yachting
vane
expected
him
home
yesterday
so
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
will
be
here
whatever
will
be
done
if
he
does
not
come
she
breathed
the
leaden
coffin
ought
to
be
soldered
down
for
you
know
sir
the
state
he
was
in
when
he
it
can
be
soldered
down
without
of
course
without
vane
it
s
not
that
sir
will
those
men
allow
it
to
be
done
the
undertakers
were
here
this
morning
at
daybreak
and
those
men
intimated
that
they
were
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
the
dead
the
words
sounded
significant
to
us
but
we
asked
them
no
questions
have
they
a
right
to
prevent
it
sir
upon
my
word
i
can
not
tell
replied
carlyle
the
proceeding
is
so
rare
a
one
that
i
know
little
what
right
of
law
they
have
or
have
not
do
not
mention
this
to
lady
isabel
and
when
va
when
lord
mount
severn
arrives
send
down
to
apprise
me
of
chapter
xi
the
new
peer
the
a
was
discerned
thundering
up
the
avenue
that
sunday
afternoon
it
contained
the
new
peer
lord
mount
severn
the
more
direct
line
of
rail
from
castle
marling
brought
him
only
to
within
five
miles
of
west
lynne
and
thence
he
had
travelled
in
a
hired
chaise
carlyle
soon
joined
him
and
almost
at
the
same
time
warburton
arrived
from
london
absence
from
town
at
the
period
of
the
earl
s
death
had
prevented
warburton
s
earlier
attendance
business
was
entered
upon
immediately
the
present
earl
knew
that
his
predecessor
had
been
an
embarrassed
man
but
he
had
no
conception
of
the
extent
of
the
evil
they
had
not
been
intimate
and
rarely
came
in
contact
as
the
various
items
of
news
were
now
detailed
to
him
the
wasteful
expenditure
the
disastrous
ruin
the
total
absence
of
provision
for
isabel
he
stood
petrified
and
aghast
he
was
a
tall
stout
man
of
years
his
nature
honorable
his
manner
cold
and
his
countenance
severe
it
is
the
most
iniquitous
piece
of
business
i
ever
heard
of
he
exclaimed
to
the
two
lawyers
of
all
the
reckless
fools
mount
severn
must
have
been
the
worst
unpardonably
improvident
as
regards
his
daughter
was
the
assenting
remark
improvident
it
must
have
been
rank
madness
retorted
the
earl
no
man
in
his
senses
could
leave
a
child
to
the
mercy
of
the
world
as
he
has
left
her
she
has
not
a
shilling
literally
not
a
shilling
in
her
possession
i
put
the
question
to
her
what
money
there
was
in
the
house
when
the
earl
died
twenty
or
pounds
she
answered
which
she
had
given
to
mason
who
required
it
for
housekeeping
purposes
if
the
girl
wants
a
yard
of
ribbon
for
herself
she
has
not
the
pence
to
pay
for
it
can
you
realize
such
a
case
to
the
mind
continued
the
excited
peer
i
will
stake
my
veracity
that
such
a
one
never
occurred
no
money
for
her
own
personal
wants
exclaimed
carlyle
not
a
halfpenny
in
the
world
and
there
are
no
funds
and
will
be
none
that
i
can
see
for
her
to
draw
quite
correct
my
lord
nodded
warburton
the
entailed
estates
go
to
you
and
what
trifling
matter
of
personal
property
may
be
left
the
creditors
will
take
care
i
understand
east
lynne
is
yours
cried
the
earl
turning
sharply
upon
carlyle
isabel
has
just
said
it
is
was
the
reply
it
became
mine
last
june
i
believe
his
lordship
kept
the
fact
a
close
he
was
obliged
to
keep
it
a
secret
interposed
warburton
addressing
lord
mount
severn
for
not
a
stiver
of
the
purchase
money
could
he
have
fingered
had
it
got
wind
except
ourselves
and
carlyle
s
agents
the
fact
was
made
known
to
it
is
strange
sir
that
you
could
not
urge
the
claims
of
his
child
upon
the
earl
rejoined
the
new
peer
to
warburton
his
tone
one
of
harsh
reproof
you
were
in
his
confidence
you
knew
the
state
of
his
affairs
it
was
in
your
line
of
duty
to
do
knowing
the
state
of
his
affairs
my
lord
we
knew
how
useless
the
urging
it
would
be
returned
warburton
your
lordship
has
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
burdens
lord
mount
severn
had
upon
him
the
interest
alone
upon
his
debts
was
frightful
and
the
deuce
s
own
work
it
was
to
get
it
not
to
speak
of
the
kites
he
let
loose
he
would
fly
them
and
nothing
could
stop
him
and
they
had
to
be
provided
oh
i
know
replied
the
earl
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
drawing
one
bill
to
cover
another
that
was
his
draw
echoed
warburton
he
would
have
drawn
a
bill
on
aldgate
pump
it
was
a
downright
mania
with
urged
to
it
by
his
necessities
i
conclude
put
in
carlyle
he
had
no
business
to
have
such
necessities
sir
cried
the
earl
wrathfully
but
let
us
proceed
to
business
what
money
is
there
lying
at
his
banker
s
warburton
do
you
know
none
was
the
blank
reply
we
overdrew
the
account
ourselves
a
fortnight
ago
to
meet
one
of
his
pressing
liabilities
we
hold
a
little
and
had
he
lived
a
week
or
two
longer
the
autumn
rents
would
have
been
paid
in
though
they
must
have
been
as
quickly
paid
out
i
m
glad
there
s
something
what
is
the
amount
my
lord
answered
warburton
shaking
his
head
in
a
manner
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
what
we
hold
will
not
half
satisfy
our
own
claims
money
actually
paid
out
of
our
then
where
on
earth
is
the
money
to
come
from
sir
for
the
funeral
for
the
servants
wages
for
everything
in
fact
there
is
none
to
come
from
anywhere
was
the
reply
of
warburton
lord
mount
severn
strode
the
carpet
more
fiercely
wicked
improvidence
shameful
profligacy
man
to
live
a
rogue
and
die
a
beggar
leaving
his
daughter
to
the
charity
of
strangers
her
case
presents
the
worst
feature
of
the
whole
remarked
carlyle
what
will
she
do
for
a
home
she
must
of
course
find
it
with
me
replied
his
lordship
and
i
should
hope
a
better
one
than
this
with
all
these
debts
and
duns
at
his
elbow
mount
severn
s
house
could
not
have
been
a
bower
of
i
fancy
she
knew
nothing
of
the
state
of
affairs
had
seen
little
if
anything
of
the
embarrassments
returned
carlyle
nonsense
said
the
peer
mr
carlyle
is
right
my
lord
observed
warburton
looking
over
his
spectacles
lady
isabel
was
in
safety
at
mount
severn
till
the
spring
and
the
purchase
money
from
east
lynne
what
the
earl
could
touch
of
it
was
a
for
many
things
and
made
matters
easy
for
the
moment
however
his
imprudences
are
at
an
end
no
they
are
not
at
an
end
returned
lord
mount
severn
they
leave
their
effects
behind
them
i
hear
there
was
a
fine
scene
yesterday
morning
some
of
the
unfortunate
wretches
he
has
taken
in
made
their
appearance
here
all
the
way
from
oh
they
are
jews
half
of
them
slightingly
spoke
warburton
if
they
do
lose
a
little
it
will
be
an
agreeable
novelty
to
jews
have
as
much
right
to
their
own
as
we
have
warburton
was
the
peer
s
angry
reprimand
and
if
they
were
turks
and
infidels
it
would
not
excuse
mount
severn
s
practices
isabel
says
it
was
you
carlyle
who
contrived
to
get
rid
of
by
convincing
them
that
east
lynne
and
its
furniture
belonged
to
me
but
there
are
those
two
men
upstairs
in
possession
of
of
him
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
earl
looked
at
him
i
do
not
understand
did
you
not
know
that
they
have
seized
the
corpse
asked
carlyle
dropping
his
voice
two
men
have
been
posted
over
it
like
sentinels
since
yesterday
morning
and
there
s
a
third
in
the
house
i
hear
who
relieves
each
other
by
turn
that
they
may
go
down
in
the
hall
and
take
their
the
earl
had
halted
in
his
walk
and
drawn
near
to
carlyle
his
mouth
open
his
face
a
marvel
of
consternation
by
george
was
all
warburton
uttered
and
snatched
off
his
glasses
mr
carlyle
do
i
understand
you
aright
that
the
body
of
the
late
earl
has
been
seized
for
a
debt
demanded
the
peer
solemnly
seize
a
dead
body
am
i
awake
or
dreaming
it
is
what
they
have
done
they
got
into
the
room
by
is
it
possible
that
transactions
so
infamous
are
permitted
by
our
law
ejaculated
the
earl
arrest
a
dead
man
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
am
shocked
beyond
expression
isabel
said
something
about
two
men
i
remember
but
she
was
so
full
of
grief
and
agitation
altogether
that
i
but
half
comprehended
what
she
did
say
upon
the
subject
why
what
will
be
done
can
t
we
bury
him
i
fancy
not
the
housekeeper
told
me
this
morning
she
feared
they
would
not
even
suffer
the
coffin
to
be
closed
down
and
that
ought
to
be
done
with
all
convenient
it
is
perfectly
horrible
uttered
the
earl
who
has
done
it
do
you
know
inquired
warburton
somebody
of
the
name
of
anstey
replied
carlyle
in
the
absence
of
any
member
of
the
family
i
took
upon
myself
to
pay
the
chamber
a
visit
and
examine
into
the
men
s
authority
the
claim
is
about
three
thousand
if
it
s
anstey
who
has
done
it
it
is
a
personal
debt
of
the
earl
s
really
owing
every
pound
of
it
observed
warburton
a
sharp
man
though
that
anstey
to
hit
upon
such
a
and
a
shameless
and
a
scandalous
man
added
lord
mount
severn
well
this
is
a
pretty
thing
what
s
to
be
done
while
they
consult
let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
lady
isabel
she
sat
alone
in
great
perplexity
indulging
the
deepest
grief
lord
mount
severn
had
intimated
to
her
kindly
and
affectionately
that
henceforth
she
must
find
her
home
with
him
and
his
wife
isabel
returned
a
faint
thank
you
and
as
soon
as
he
left
her
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
rebellious
tears
have
her
home
with
vane
she
uttered
to
her
own
heart
no
never
rather
would
she
die
rather
would
she
eat
a
crust
and
drink
water
and
so
on
and
so
on
young
demoiselles
are
somewhat
prone
to
indulge
in
these
flights
of
fancy
but
they
are
in
most
cases
impracticable
and
foolish
exceedingly
so
in
that
of
lady
isabel
vane
work
for
their
living
it
may
appear
very
feasible
in
theory
but
theory
and
practice
are
as
opposite
as
light
and
dark
the
plain
fact
was
that
isabel
had
no
alternative
whatever
save
that
of
accepting
a
home
with
lady
mount
severn
and
the
conviction
that
it
must
be
so
stole
over
her
spirit
even
while
her
hasty
lips
were
protesting
that
she
would
not
two
mourners
only
attended
the
funeral
the
earl
and
carlyle
the
latter
was
no
relative
of
the
deceased
and
but
a
very
recent
friend
but
the
earl
had
invited
him
probably
not
liking
the
parading
solus
his
trappings
of
woe
some
of
the
county
aristocracy
were
pallbearers
and
many
private
carriages
followed
all
was
bustle
on
the
following
morning
the
earl
was
to
depart
and
isabel
was
to
depart
but
not
together
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
domestics
would
disperse
the
earl
was
speeding
to
london
and
the
chaise
to
convey
him
to
the
railway
station
at
west
lynne
was
already
at
the
door
when
carlyle
arrived
i
was
getting
fidgety
fearing
you
would
not
be
here
for
i
have
barely
five
minutes
to
spare
observed
the
earl
as
he
shook
hands
you
are
sure
you
fully
understood
about
the
tombstone
perfectly
replied
carlyle
how
is
lady
isabel
very
i
fear
poor
child
for
she
did
not
breakfast
with
me
replied
the
earl
mason
privately
told
me
that
she
was
in
a
convulsion
of
grief
a
bad
man
a
bad
man
was
mount
severn
he
emphatically
added
as
he
rose
and
rang
the
bell
let
lady
isabel
be
informed
that
i
am
ready
to
depart
and
that
i
wait
to
see
her
he
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
it
and
while
she
is
coming
carlyle
he
added
allow
me
to
express
my
obligations
to
you
how
i
should
have
got
along
in
this
worrying
business
without
you
i
can
not
divine
you
have
promised
mind
to
pay
me
a
visit
and
i
shall
expect
it
promised
conditionally
that
i
find
myself
in
your
neighborhood
smiled
carlyle
should
isabel
entered
dressed
also
and
ready
for
she
was
to
depart
immediately
after
the
earl
her
crape
veil
was
over
her
face
but
she
threw
it
back
my
time
is
up
isabel
and
i
must
go
is
there
anything
you
wish
to
say
to
me
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
but
glanced
at
carlyle
and
hesitated
he
was
standing
at
the
window
his
back
towards
them
i
suppose
not
said
the
earl
answering
himself
for
he
was
in
a
fever
of
hurry
to
be
off
like
many
others
are
when
starting
on
a
journey
you
will
have
no
trouble
whatever
my
dear
only
mind
you
get
some
refreshments
in
the
middle
of
the
day
for
you
won
t
be
at
castle
marling
before
tell
va
tell
lady
mount
severn
that
i
had
no
time
to
write
but
will
do
so
from
but
isabel
stood
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
uncertainty
of
expectancy
it
may
be
said
her
color
varying
what
is
it
you
wish
to
say
something
she
certainly
did
wish
to
say
something
but
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
a
moment
of
embarrassment
to
her
intensely
painful
and
the
presence
of
carlyle
did
not
tend
to
lessen
it
the
latter
had
no
idea
his
absence
was
wished
for
bless
me
isabel
i
declare
i
forgot
all
about
it
cried
the
earl
in
a
tone
of
vexation
not
being
accustomed
to
this
aspect
of
affairs
is
so
new
he
broke
off
his
disjointed
sentences
unbuttoned
his
coat
drew
out
his
purse
and
paused
over
its
contents
isabel
i
have
run
myself
very
short
and
have
but
little
beyond
what
will
take
me
to
town
you
must
make
three
pounds
do
for
now
my
dear
once
at
castle
marling
pound
has
the
funds
for
the
journey
lady
mount
severn
will
supply
you
but
you
must
tell
her
or
she
will
not
he
shot
some
gold
out
of
his
purse
as
he
spoke
and
left
two
sovereigns
and
two
half
sovereigns
on
the
table
farewell
my
dear
make
yourself
happy
at
castle
marling
i
shall
be
home
passing
from
the
room
with
carlyle
he
stood
talking
with
that
gentleman
a
minute
his
foot
on
the
step
of
the
chaise
and
the
next
was
being
whisked
away
carlyle
returned
to
the
where
isabel
an
ashy
whiteness
having
replaced
the
crimson
on
her
cheeks
was
picking
up
the
gold
will
you
do
me
a
favor
carlyle
i
will
do
anything
i
can
for
she
pushed
a
sovereign
and
a
half
toward
him
it
is
for
kane
i
told
marvel
to
send
in
and
pay
him
but
it
seems
she
forgot
it
or
put
it
off
and
he
is
not
paid
the
tickets
were
a
sovereign
the
rest
is
for
tuning
the
piano
will
you
kindly
give
it
him
if
i
trust
one
of
the
servants
it
may
be
forgotten
again
in
the
hurry
of
their
kane
s
charge
for
tuning
a
piano
is
five
shillings
remarked
carlyle
but
he
was
a
long
time
occupied
with
it
and
did
something
with
the
leathers
it
is
not
too
much
besides
i
never
ordered
him
anything
to
eat
he
wants
money
even
worse
than
i
do
she
added
with
a
poor
attempt
at
a
smile
but
for
thinking
of
him
i
should
not
have
mustered
the
courage
to
beg
of
lord
mount
severn
as
you
have
just
heard
me
do
in
that
case
do
you
know
what
i
should
have
done
what
should
you
have
done
he
smiled
i
should
have
asked
you
to
pay
him
for
me
and
i
would
have
repaid
you
as
soon
as
i
had
any
money
i
had
a
great
mind
to
ask
you
do
you
know
it
would
have
been
less
painful
than
being
obliged
to
beg
of
lord
mount
i
hope
it
would
he
answered
in
a
low
earnest
tone
what
else
can
i
do
for
you
she
was
about
to
answer
nothing
that
he
had
done
enough
but
at
that
moment
their
attention
was
attracted
by
a
bustle
outside
and
they
moved
to
the
window
it
was
the
carriage
coming
round
for
lady
isabel
the
late
earl
s
chariot
which
was
to
convey
her
to
the
railway
station
six
or
seven
miles
off
it
had
four
to
it
the
number
having
been
designated
by
lord
mount
severn
who
appeared
to
wish
isabel
to
leave
the
neighborhood
in
as
much
state
as
she
had
entered
it
the
carriage
was
packed
and
marvel
was
perched
outside
all
is
ready
she
said
and
the
time
is
come
for
me
to
go
carlyle
i
am
going
to
leave
you
a
legacy
those
pretty
gold
and
silver
fish
that
i
bought
a
few
weeks
but
why
do
you
not
take
them
take
them
to
lady
mount
severn
no
i
would
rather
leave
them
with
you
throw
a
few
crumbs
into
the
globe
now
and
her
face
was
wet
with
tears
and
he
knew
that
she
was
talking
hurriedly
to
cover
her
emotion
sit
down
a
few
minutes
he
said
no
no
i
had
better
go
at
he
took
her
hand
to
conduct
her
to
the
carriage
the
servants
were
gathered
in
the
hall
waiting
for
her
some
had
grown
gray
in
her
father
s
service
she
put
out
her
hand
she
strove
to
say
a
word
of
thanks
and
of
farewell
and
she
thought
she
would
choke
at
the
effort
of
keeping
down
the
sobs
at
length
it
was
over
a
kind
look
around
a
yearning
wave
of
the
hand
and
she
passed
on
with
carlyle
pound
had
ascended
to
his
place
by
marvel
and
the
postboys
were
awaiting
the
signal
to
start
but
carlyle
had
the
carriage
door
open
again
and
was
bending
in
holding
her
hand
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
thanks
to
you
for
all
your
kindness
carlyle
she
cried
her
breath
very
labored
i
am
sure
you
have
seen
that
i
could
i
wish
i
could
have
done
more
i
wish
i
could
have
shielded
you
from
the
annoyances
you
have
been
obliged
to
endure
he
answered
should
we
never
meet
again
oh
but
we
shall
meet
again
she
interrupted
you
promised
lord
mount
true
we
may
so
meet
casually
once
in
a
way
but
our
ordinary
paths
in
life
lie
far
and
wide
apart
god
forever
bless
you
dear
lady
isabel
the
postboys
touched
their
horses
and
the
carriage
sped
on
she
drew
down
the
blinds
and
leaned
back
in
an
agony
of
tears
tears
for
the
house
she
was
leaving
for
the
father
she
had
lost
her
last
thoughts
had
been
of
gratitude
to
carlyle
but
she
had
more
cause
to
be
grateful
to
him
than
she
yet
knew
of
emotion
soon
spent
itself
and
as
her
eyes
cleared
she
saw
a
bit
of
crumpled
paper
lying
on
her
lap
which
appeared
to
have
fallen
from
her
hand
mechanically
she
took
it
up
and
opened
it
it
was
a
for
one
hundred
pounds
ah
reader
you
will
say
that
this
is
a
romance
of
fiction
and
a
fetched
one
but
it
is
verily
and
indeed
true
carlyle
had
taken
it
with
him
to
east
lynne
that
morning
with
its
destined
purpose
lady
isabel
strained
her
eyes
and
gazed
at
the
note
gazed
and
gazed
again
where
could
it
have
come
from
what
had
brought
it
there
suddenly
the
undoubted
truth
flashed
upon
her
carlyle
had
left
it
in
her
hand
her
cheeks
burned
her
fingers
trembled
her
angry
spirit
rose
up
in
arms
in
that
first
moment
of
discovery
she
was
ready
to
resent
it
as
an
insult
but
when
she
came
to
remember
the
sober
facts
of
the
last
few
days
her
anger
subsided
into
admiration
of
his
wondrous
kindness
did
he
not
know
that
she
was
without
a
home
to
call
her
own
without
money
absolutely
without
money
save
what
would
be
given
her
in
charity
when
lord
mount
severn
reached
london
and
the
hotel
which
the
vanes
were
in
the
habit
of
using
the
first
object
his
eyes
lighted
on
was
his
own
wife
whom
he
had
believed
to
be
safe
at
castle
marling
he
inquired
the
cause
lady
mount
severn
gave
herself
little
trouble
to
explain
she
had
been
up
a
day
or
two
could
order
her
mourning
so
much
better
in
person
and
william
did
not
seem
well
so
she
brought
him
up
for
a
change
i
am
sorry
you
came
to
town
emma
remarked
the
earl
after
listening
isabel
is
gone
to
castle
lady
mount
severn
quickly
lifted
her
head
what
s
she
gone
there
for
it
is
the
most
disgraceful
piece
of
business
altogether
returned
the
earl
without
replying
to
the
immediate
question
mount
severn
has
died
worse
than
a
beggar
and
there
s
not
a
shilling
for
it
never
was
expected
there
would
be
but
there
s
nothing
not
a
penny
nothing
for
her
own
personal
expenses
i
gave
her
a
pound
or
two
for
she
was
completely
destitute
the
countess
opened
her
eyes
where
will
she
live
what
will
become
of
her
she
must
live
with
us
she
with
us
interrupted
lady
mount
severn
her
voice
almost
reaching
a
scream
that
she
never
she
must
emma
there
is
nowhere
else
for
her
to
live
i
have
been
obliged
to
decide
it
so
and
she
is
gone
as
i
tell
you
to
castle
marling
lady
mount
severn
grew
pale
with
anger
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
confronted
her
husband
the
table
being
between
them
listen
raymond
i
will
not
have
isabel
vane
under
my
roof
i
hate
her
how
could
you
be
cajoled
into
sanctioning
such
a
thing
i
was
not
cajoled
and
my
sanction
was
not
asked
he
mildly
replied
i
proposed
it
where
else
is
she
to
be
i
don
t
care
where
was
the
obstinate
retort
never
with
she
is
at
castle
marling
now
gone
to
it
as
her
home
resumed
the
earl
and
even
you
when
you
return
will
scarcely
venture
to
turn
her
out
again
into
the
road
or
to
the
workhouse
she
will
not
trouble
you
long
carelessly
continued
the
earl
one
so
lovely
as
isabel
will
be
sure
to
marry
early
and
she
appears
as
gentle
and
a
girl
as
i
ever
saw
so
whence
can
arise
your
dislike
to
her
i
don
t
pretend
to
guess
many
a
man
will
be
ready
to
forget
her
want
of
fortune
for
the
sake
of
her
she
shall
marry
the
first
who
asks
her
snapped
the
angry
lady
i
ll
take
care
of
chapter
xii
life
at
castle
marling
isabel
had
been
in
her
new
home
about
ten
days
when
lord
and
lady
mount
severn
arrived
at
castle
marling
which
was
not
a
castle
you
may
as
well
be
told
but
only
the
name
of
a
town
nearly
contiguous
to
which
was
their
residence
a
small
estate
lord
mount
severn
welcomed
isabel
lady
mount
severn
also
after
a
fashion
but
her
manner
was
so
repellant
so
insolently
patronizing
that
it
brought
the
indignant
crimson
to
the
cheeks
of
lady
isabel
and
if
this
was
the
case
at
the
first
meeting
what
do
you
suppose
it
must
have
been
as
time
went
on
galling
slights
petty
vexations
chilling
annoyances
were
put
upon
her
trying
her
powers
of
endurance
to
the
very
length
of
their
tether
she
would
wring
her
hands
when
alone
and
passionately
wish
that
she
could
find
another
refuge
the
earl
and
countess
had
two
children
both
boys
and
in
february
the
younger
one
always
a
delicate
child
died
this
somewhat
altered
their
plans
instead
of
proceeding
to
london
after
easter
as
had
been
decided
upon
they
would
not
go
till
may
the
earl
had
passed
part
of
the
winter
at
mount
severn
looking
after
the
repairs
and
renovations
that
were
being
made
there
in
march
he
went
to
paris
full
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
boy
far
greater
grief
than
was
experienced
by
lady
mount
severn
april
approached
and
with
it
easter
to
the
unconcealed
dismay
of
lady
mount
severn
her
grandmother
levison
wrote
her
word
that
she
required
change
and
should
pass
easter
with
her
at
castle
marling
lady
mount
severn
would
have
given
her
diamonds
to
have
got
out
of
it
but
there
was
no
escape
diamonds
that
were
once
isabel
s
at
least
that
isabel
had
worn
on
the
monday
in
passion
week
the
old
lady
arrived
and
with
her
francis
levison
they
had
no
other
guests
things
went
on
pretty
smoothly
till
good
friday
on
good
friday
afternoon
isabel
strolled
out
with
little
william
vane
captain
levison
joined
them
and
they
never
came
in
till
nearly
time
when
the
three
entered
together
lady
mount
severn
doing
penance
all
the
time
and
nursing
her
rage
against
isabel
for
levison
kept
her
indoors
there
was
barely
time
to
dress
for
dinner
and
isabel
went
straight
to
her
room
her
dress
was
off
her
on
marvel
was
busy
with
her
hair
and
william
chattering
at
her
knee
when
the
door
was
flung
open
and
my
lady
entered
where
have
you
been
demanded
she
shaking
with
passion
isabel
knew
the
signs
strolling
about
in
the
shrubberies
and
grounds
answered
isabel
how
dare
you
so
disgrace
yourself
i
do
not
understand
you
said
isabel
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
unpleasantly
marvel
you
are
pulling
my
when
women
liable
to
intemperate
fits
of
passion
give
the
reins
to
them
they
neither
know
nor
care
what
they
say
lady
mount
severn
broke
into
a
torrent
of
reproach
and
abuses
most
degrading
and
unjustifiable
is
it
not
sufficient
that
you
are
allowed
an
asylum
in
my
house
but
you
must
also
disgrace
it
three
hours
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
with
francis
levison
you
have
done
nothing
but
flirt
with
him
from
the
moment
he
came
you
did
nothing
else
at
the
attack
was
longer
and
broader
but
that
was
the
substance
of
it
and
isabel
was
goaded
to
resistance
to
anger
little
less
great
than
that
of
the
countess
this
and
before
her
attendant
she
an
earl
s
daughter
so
much
better
born
than
emma
mount
severn
to
be
thus
insultingly
accused
in
the
other
s
mad
jealousy
isabel
tossed
her
hair
from
the
hands
of
marvel
rose
up
and
confronted
the
countess
constraining
her
voice
to
calmness
i
do
not
flirt
she
said
i
have
never
flirted
i
leave
that
and
she
could
not
wholly
suppress
in
tone
the
scorn
she
felt
to
married
women
though
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
fault
less
venial
in
them
than
in
single
ones
there
is
but
one
inmate
of
this
house
who
flirts
so
far
as
i
have
seen
since
i
have
lived
in
it
is
it
you
or
i
lady
mount
severn
the
home
truth
told
on
her
ladyship
she
turned
white
with
rage
forgot
her
manners
and
raising
her
right
hand
struck
isabel
a
stinging
blow
upon
the
left
cheek
confused
and
terrified
isabel
stood
in
pain
and
before
she
could
speak
or
act
my
lady
s
left
hand
was
raised
to
the
other
cheek
and
a
blow
left
on
that
lady
isabel
shivered
as
with
a
sudden
chill
and
cried
out
a
sharp
quick
cry
covered
her
outraged
face
and
sank
down
upon
the
dressing
chair
marvel
threw
up
her
hands
in
dismay
and
william
vane
could
not
have
burst
into
a
louder
roar
had
he
been
beaten
himself
the
boy
he
was
of
a
sensitive
nature
was
frightened
my
good
reader
are
you
one
of
the
inexperienced
ones
who
borrow
notions
of
fashionable
life
from
the
novels
got
in
a
library
taking
their
contents
for
gospel
and
religiously
believing
that
lords
and
ladies
live
upon
stilts
speak
eat
move
breathe
by
the
rules
of
only
are
you
under
the
delusion
too
many
are
that
the
days
of
dukes
and
duchesses
are
spent
discussing
pictures
tastes
shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
that
they
are
strung
on
polite
wires
of
silver
and
can
t
get
off
the
hinges
never
giving
vent
to
angry
tempers
to
words
unorthodox
as
commonplace
mortals
do
that
will
come
to
pass
when
the
great
creator
shall
see
fit
to
send
men
into
the
world
free
from
baneful
tempers
evil
passions
from
the
sins
bequeathed
from
the
fall
of
adam
lady
mount
severn
finished
up
the
scene
by
boxing
william
for
his
noise
jerked
him
out
of
the
room
and
told
him
he
was
a
monkey
isabel
vane
lived
through
the
livelong
night
weeping
tears
of
anguish
and
indignation
she
would
not
remain
at
castle
marling
who
would
after
so
great
an
outrage
yet
where
was
she
to
go
fifty
times
in
the
course
of
the
night
did
she
wish
that
she
was
laid
beside
her
father
for
her
feelings
obtained
the
mastery
of
her
reason
in
her
calm
moments
she
would
have
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
death
as
the
young
and
healthy
must
do
she
rose
on
the
saturday
morning
weak
and
languid
the
effects
of
the
night
of
grief
and
marvel
brought
her
breakfast
up
william
vane
stole
into
her
room
afterward
he
was
attached
to
her
in
a
remarkable
degree
mamma
s
going
out
he
exclaimed
in
the
course
of
the
morning
look
isabel
went
to
the
window
lady
mount
severn
was
in
the
pony
carriage
francis
levison
driving
we
can
go
down
now
isabel
nobody
will
be
she
assented
and
went
down
with
william
but
scarcely
were
they
in
the
when
a
servant
entered
with
a
card
on
a
salver
a
gentleman
my
lady
wishes
to
see
to
see
me
returned
isabel
in
surprise
or
lady
mount
severn
he
asked
for
you
my
she
took
up
the
card
mr
oh
she
uttered
in
a
tone
of
joyful
surprise
show
him
it
is
curious
nay
appalling
to
trace
the
thread
in
a
human
life
how
the
most
trivial
occurrences
lead
to
the
great
events
of
existence
bringing
forth
happiness
or
misery
weal
or
woe
a
client
of
carlyle
s
travelling
from
one
part
of
england
to
the
other
was
arrested
by
illness
at
castle
marling
grave
illness
it
appeared
to
be
inducing
fears
of
death
he
had
not
as
the
phrase
goes
settled
his
affairs
and
carlyle
was
telegraphed
for
in
haste
to
make
his
will
and
for
other
private
matters
a
very
simple
occurrence
it
appeared
to
carlyle
this
journey
and
yet
it
was
destined
to
lead
to
events
that
would
end
only
with
his
own
life
carlyle
entered
unaffected
and
gentlemanly
as
ever
with
his
noble
form
his
attractive
face
and
his
drooping
eyelids
she
advanced
to
meet
him
holding
out
her
hand
her
countenance
betraying
her
pleasure
this
is
indeed
unexpected
she
exclaimed
how
very
pleased
i
am
to
see
business
brought
me
yesterday
to
castle
marling
i
could
not
leave
it
again
without
calling
on
you
i
hear
that
lord
mount
severn
is
he
is
in
france
she
rejoined
i
said
we
should
be
sure
to
meet
again
do
you
remember
carlyle
you
isabel
suddenly
stopped
for
with
the
word
remember
she
also
remembered
something
the
hundred
pound
note
and
what
she
was
saying
faltered
on
her
tongue
confused
indeed
grew
she
for
alas
she
had
changed
and
partly
spent
it
how
was
it
possible
to
ask
lady
mount
severn
for
money
and
the
earl
was
nearly
always
away
carlyle
saw
her
embarrassment
though
he
may
not
have
detected
its
cause
what
a
fine
boy
exclaimed
he
looking
at
the
child
it
is
lord
vane
said
isabel
a
truthful
earnest
spirit
i
am
sure
he
continued
gazing
at
his
open
countenance
how
old
are
you
my
little
man
i
am
six
sir
and
my
brother
was
isabel
bent
over
the
child
an
excuse
to
cover
her
perplexity
you
do
not
know
this
gentleman
william
it
is
carlyle
and
he
has
been
very
kind
to
the
little
lord
had
turned
his
thoughtful
eyes
on
carlyle
apparently
studying
his
countenance
i
shall
like
you
sir
if
you
are
kind
to
isabel
are
you
kind
to
her
very
very
kind
murmured
lady
isabel
leaving
william
and
turning
to
carlyle
but
not
looking
at
him
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
i
ought
to
thank
you
i
did
not
intend
to
use
the
to
use
it
but
i
i
hush
he
interrupted
laughing
at
her
confusion
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
of
i
have
a
great
misfortune
to
break
to
you
lady
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
her
glowing
cheeks
somewhat
aroused
from
her
own
thoughts
two
of
your
fish
are
dead
the
gold
are
they
i
believe
it
was
the
frost
killed
them
i
don
t
know
what
else
it
could
have
been
you
may
remember
those
bitter
days
we
had
in
january
they
died
you
are
very
good
to
take
care
of
them
all
this
while
how
is
east
lynne
looking
dear
east
lynne
is
it
occupied
not
yet
i
have
spent
some
money
upon
it
and
it
repays
the
the
excitement
of
his
arrival
had
worn
off
and
she
was
looking
herself
again
pale
and
sad
he
could
not
help
observing
that
she
was
changed
i
can
not
expect
to
look
so
well
at
castle
marling
as
i
did
at
east
lynne
she
answered
i
trust
it
is
a
happy
home
to
you
said
carlyle
speaking
upon
impulse
she
glanced
up
at
him
a
look
that
he
would
never
forget
it
certainly
told
of
despair
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
it
is
a
miserable
home
and
i
can
not
remain
in
it
i
have
been
awake
all
night
thinking
where
i
can
go
but
i
can
not
tell
i
have
not
a
friend
in
the
wide
never
let
people
talk
secrets
before
children
for
be
assured
that
they
comprehend
a
vast
deal
more
than
is
expedient
the
saying
that
little
pitchers
have
great
ears
is
wonderfully
true
lord
vane
held
up
his
hand
to
carlyle
isabel
told
me
this
morning
that
she
should
go
away
from
us
shall
i
tell
you
why
mamma
beat
her
yesterday
when
she
was
be
quiet
william
interrupted
lady
isabel
her
face
in
a
flame
two
great
slaps
upon
her
cheeks
continued
the
young
viscount
and
isabel
cried
so
and
i
screamed
and
then
mamma
hit
me
but
boys
are
made
to
be
hit
nurse
says
so
marvel
came
into
the
nursery
when
we
were
at
tea
and
told
nurse
about
it
she
says
isabel
s
too
and
that
s
why
mamma
isabel
stopped
the
child
s
tongue
rang
a
peal
on
the
bell
and
marched
him
to
the
door
dispatching
him
to
the
nursery
by
the
servant
who
answered
it
carlyle
s
eyes
were
full
of
indignant
sympathy
can
this
be
true
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
when
she
returned
to
him
you
do
indeed
want
a
i
must
bear
my
lot
she
replied
obeying
the
impulse
which
prompted
her
to
confide
in
carlyle
at
least
till
lord
mount
severn
and
then
i
really
do
not
know
she
said
the
rebellious
tears
rising
faster
than
she
could
choke
them
down
he
has
no
other
home
to
offer
me
but
with
lady
mount
severn
i
can
not
and
will
not
remain
she
would
break
my
heart
as
she
has
already
broken
my
spirit
i
have
not
deserved
it
of
her
no
i
am
sure
you
have
not
he
warmly
answered
i
wish
i
could
help
you
what
can
i
do
you
can
do
nothing
she
said
what
can
any
one
do
i
wish
i
wish
i
could
help
you
he
repeated
east
lynne
was
not
take
it
for
all
in
all
a
pleasant
home
to
you
but
it
seems
you
changed
for
the
worse
when
you
not
a
pleasant
home
she
echoed
its
reminiscences
appearing
delightful
in
that
moment
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
all
things
are
estimated
by
comparison
indeed
it
was
i
may
never
have
so
pleasant
a
one
again
carlyle
do
not
disparage
east
lynne
to
me
would
i
could
awake
and
find
the
last
few
months
but
a
hideous
dream
that
i
could
find
my
dear
father
alive
again
that
we
were
still
living
peacefully
at
east
lynne
it
would
be
a
very
eden
to
me
what
was
carlyle
about
to
say
what
emotion
was
it
that
agitated
his
countenance
impeded
his
breath
and
dyed
his
face
his
better
genius
was
surely
not
watching
over
him
or
those
words
had
never
been
spoken
there
is
but
one
way
he
began
taking
her
hand
and
nervously
playing
with
it
probably
unconscious
that
he
did
so
only
one
way
in
which
you
could
return
to
east
lynne
and
that
way
i
may
not
presume
perhaps
to
point
it
she
looked
at
him
and
waited
for
an
explanation
if
my
words
offend
you
lady
isabel
check
them
as
their
presumption
deserves
and
pardon
me
may
i
dare
i
offer
you
to
return
to
east
lynne
as
its
mistress
she
did
not
comprehend
him
in
the
slightest
degree
the
drift
of
his
meaning
never
dawned
upon
her
return
to
east
lynne
as
its
mistress
she
repeated
in
bewilderment
and
as
my
wife
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
him
now
and
the
shock
and
surprise
were
great
she
had
stood
there
by
carlyle
s
side
conversing
confidentially
with
him
esteeming
him
greatly
feeling
as
if
he
were
her
truest
friend
on
earth
clinging
to
him
in
her
heart
as
to
a
powerful
haven
of
refuge
loving
him
almost
as
she
would
a
brother
suffering
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
but
to
be
his
wife
the
idea
had
never
presented
itself
to
her
in
any
shape
until
this
moment
and
her
mind
s
first
emotion
was
one
of
entire
opposition
her
first
movement
to
express
it
as
she
essayed
to
withdraw
herself
and
her
hand
away
from
him
but
not
so
carlyle
did
not
suffer
it
he
not
only
retained
that
hand
but
took
the
other
also
and
spoke
now
the
ice
was
broken
eloquent
words
of
love
not
unmeaning
phrases
of
rhapsody
about
hearts
and
darts
and
dying
for
her
such
as
somebody
else
might
have
given
utterance
to
but
words
of
deep
tenderness
calculated
to
win
upon
the
mind
s
good
sense
as
well
as
upon
the
ear
and
heart
and
it
may
be
that
had
her
imagination
not
been
filled
up
with
that
somebody
else
she
would
have
said
yes
there
and
then
they
were
suddenly
interrupted
lady
mount
severn
entered
and
took
in
the
scene
at
a
glance
carlyle
s
bent
attitude
of
devotion
his
imprisonment
of
the
hands
and
isabel
s
perplexed
and
blushing
countenance
she
threw
up
her
head
and
her
little
inquisitive
nose
and
stopped
short
on
the
carpet
her
freezing
looks
demanded
an
explanation
as
plainly
as
looks
can
do
it
carlyle
turned
to
her
and
by
way
of
sparing
isabel
proceeded
to
introduce
himself
isabel
had
just
presence
of
mind
left
to
name
her
lady
mount
i
am
sorry
that
lord
mount
severn
should
be
absent
to
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
being
known
he
said
i
am
i
have
heard
of
you
replied
her
ladyship
scanning
his
good
looks
and
feeling
cross
that
his
homage
should
be
given
where
she
saw
it
was
given
but
i
had
not
heard
that
you
and
lady
isabel
vane
were
on
the
extraordinary
terms
of
intimacy
that
that
madam
he
interrupted
as
he
handed
a
chair
to
her
ladyship
and
took
another
himself
we
have
never
yet
been
on
terms
of
extraordinary
intimacy
i
was
begging
the
lady
isabel
to
grant
that
we
may
be
i
was
asking
her
to
become
my
the
avowal
was
as
a
shower
of
incense
to
the
countess
and
her
ill
humor
melted
into
sunshine
it
was
a
solution
to
her
great
difficulty
a
loophole
by
which
she
might
get
rid
of
her
bete
noire
the
hated
isabel
a
flush
of
gratification
lighted
her
face
and
she
became
full
of
graciousness
to
carlyle
how
very
grateful
isabel
must
feel
to
you
quoth
she
i
speak
openly
carlyle
because
i
know
that
you
were
cognizant
of
the
unprotected
state
in
which
she
was
left
by
the
earl
s
improvidence
putting
marriage
for
her
at
any
rate
a
high
marriage
nearly
out
of
the
question
east
lynne
is
a
beautiful
place
i
have
for
its
size
it
is
not
large
replied
carlyle
as
he
rose
for
isabel
had
also
risen
and
was
coming
forward
and
pray
what
is
lady
isabel
s
answer
quickly
asked
the
countess
turning
to
her
not
to
her
did
isabel
condescend
to
give
an
answer
but
she
approached
carlyle
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
will
you
give
me
a
few
hours
for
consideration
i
am
only
too
happy
that
you
should
accord
it
consideration
for
it
speaks
to
me
of
hope
was
his
reply
as
he
opened
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
i
will
be
here
again
this
it
was
a
perplexing
debate
that
lady
isabel
held
with
herself
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
whilst
carlyle
touched
upon
ways
and
means
to
lady
mount
severn
isabel
was
little
more
than
a
child
and
as
a
child
she
reasoned
looking
neither
far
nor
deep
the
shallow
palpable
aspect
of
affairs
alone
presenting
itself
to
her
view
that
carlyle
was
not
of
rank
equal
to
her
own
she
scarcely
remembered
east
lynne
seemed
a
very
fair
settlement
in
life
and
in
point
of
size
beauty
and
importance
it
was
far
superior
to
the
house
she
was
now
in
she
forgot
that
her
position
in
east
lynne
as
carlyle
s
wife
would
not
be
what
it
had
been
as
lord
mount
severn
s
daughter
she
forgot
that
she
would
be
tied
to
a
quiet
house
shut
out
from
the
great
world
the
pomps
and
vanities
to
which
she
was
born
she
liked
carlyle
much
she
experienced
pleasure
in
conversing
with
him
she
liked
to
be
with
him
in
short
but
for
that
other
fancy
which
had
crept
over
her
there
would
have
been
danger
of
her
falling
in
love
with
carlyle
and
oh
to
be
removed
forever
from
the
bitter
dependence
on
lady
mount
severn
east
lynne
would
in
truth
after
that
seem
what
she
had
called
it
eden
so
far
it
looks
favorable
mentally
exclaimed
poor
isabel
but
there
is
the
other
side
of
the
question
it
is
not
only
that
i
do
not
love
carlyle
but
i
fear
i
do
love
or
very
nearly
love
francis
levison
i
wish
he
would
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
or
that
i
had
never
seen
isabel
s
soliloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
levison
and
the
countess
what
the
latter
had
said
to
the
old
lady
to
win
her
to
the
cause
was
best
known
to
herself
but
she
was
eloquent
in
it
they
both
used
every
possible
argument
to
induce
her
to
accept
carlyle
the
old
lady
declaring
that
she
had
never
been
introduced
to
any
one
she
was
so
much
taken
with
and
levison
was
incapable
of
asserting
what
was
not
true
that
he
was
worth
a
dozen
men
of
the
great
world
isabel
listened
now
swayed
one
way
now
the
other
and
when
afternoon
came
her
head
was
aching
with
perplexity
the
stumbling
block
that
she
could
not
get
over
was
francis
levison
she
saw
carlyle
approach
from
her
window
and
went
down
to
the
not
in
the
least
knowing
what
her
answer
was
to
be
a
shadowy
idea
was
presenting
itself
that
she
would
ask
him
for
longer
time
and
write
her
answer
in
the
was
francis
levison
and
her
heart
beat
wildly
which
said
beating
might
have
convinced
her
that
she
ought
not
to
marry
another
where
have
you
been
hiding
yourself
cried
he
did
you
hear
of
our
mishap
with
the
pony
carriage
no
was
her
answer
i
was
driving
emma
into
town
the
pony
took
fright
kicked
plunged
and
went
down
upon
his
knees
she
took
fright
in
turn
got
out
and
walked
back
so
i
gave
the
brute
some
chastisement
and
a
race
and
brought
him
to
the
stables
getting
home
in
time
to
be
introduced
to
carlyle
he
seems
an
good
fellow
isabel
and
i
congratulate
what
she
uttered
don
t
start
we
are
all
in
the
family
and
my
lady
told
i
won
t
betray
it
abroad
she
says
east
lynne
is
a
place
to
be
coveted
i
wish
you
happiness
thank
you
she
returned
in
a
sarcastic
tone
though
her
throat
beat
and
her
lips
quivered
you
are
premature
in
your
congratulations
captain
am
i
keep
my
good
wishes
then
till
the
right
man
comes
i
am
beyond
the
pale
myself
and
dare
not
think
of
entering
the
happy
state
he
added
in
a
pointed
tone
i
have
indulged
dreams
of
it
like
others
but
i
can
not
afford
to
indulge
them
seriously
a
poor
man
with
uncertain
prospects
can
only
play
the
butterfly
perhaps
to
his
life
s
he
quitted
the
room
as
he
spoke
it
was
impossible
for
isabel
to
misunderstand
him
but
a
feeling
shot
across
her
mind
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
false
and
heartless
one
of
the
servants
appeared
showing
in
carlyle
nothing
false
or
heartless
about
him
he
closed
the
door
and
approached
her
but
she
did
not
speak
and
her
lips
were
white
and
trembling
carlyle
waited
well
he
said
at
length
in
a
gentle
tone
have
you
decided
to
grant
my
prayer
yes
but
she
could
not
go
on
what
with
one
agitation
and
another
she
had
difficulty
in
conquering
her
emotion
but
i
was
going
to
tell
you
presently
he
whispered
leading
her
to
a
sofa
we
can
both
afford
to
wait
now
oh
isabel
you
have
made
me
very
happy
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
must
tell
you
she
began
again
in
the
midst
of
hysterical
tears
though
i
have
said
yes
to
your
proposal
i
do
not
yet
it
has
come
upon
me
by
surprise
she
stammered
i
like
you
very
much
i
esteem
and
respect
you
but
i
do
not
love
i
should
wonder
if
you
did
but
you
will
let
me
earn
your
love
isabel
oh
yes
she
earnestly
answered
i
hope
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
bent
his
face
and
took
from
her
lips
his
first
kiss
isabel
was
passive
she
supposed
he
had
gained
the
right
to
do
so
my
dearest
it
is
all
i
chapter
xiii
a
moonlight
walk
the
sensations
of
carlyle
when
he
returned
to
west
lynne
were
much
like
those
of
an
eton
boy
who
knows
he
has
been
in
mischief
and
dreads
detection
always
open
as
to
his
own
affairs
for
he
had
nothing
to
conceal
he
yet
deemed
it
expedient
to
dissemble
now
he
felt
that
his
sister
would
be
bitter
at
the
prospect
of
his
marrying
instinct
had
taught
him
that
years
past
and
he
believed
that
of
all
women
the
most
objectionable
to
her
would
be
lady
isabel
for
miss
carlyle
looked
to
the
useful
and
had
neither
sympathy
nor
admiration
for
the
beautiful
he
was
not
sure
but
she
might
be
capable
of
endeavoring
to
frustrate
the
marriage
should
news
of
it
reach
her
ears
and
her
indomitable
will
had
caused
many
strange
things
in
her
life
therefore
you
will
not
blame
carlyle
for
observing
entire
reticence
as
to
his
future
plans
a
family
of
the
name
of
carew
had
been
about
taking
east
lynne
they
wished
to
rent
it
furnished
for
three
years
upon
some
of
the
minor
arrangements
they
and
carlyle
were
opposed
but
the
latter
declined
to
give
way
during
his
absence
at
castle
marling
news
had
arrived
from
them
they
had
acceded
to
all
his
terms
and
would
enter
upon
east
lynne
as
soon
as
it
was
convenient
miss
carlyle
was
full
of
congratulations
it
was
off
their
hands
she
said
but
the
first
letter
carlyle
wrote
was
to
decline
them
he
did
not
tell
this
to
miss
carlyle
the
final
touches
to
the
house
were
given
preparatory
to
the
reception
of
its
inhabitants
and
three
maids
and
two
men
servants
hired
and
sent
there
upon
board
wages
until
the
family
should
arrive
one
evening
three
weeks
subsequent
to
carlyle
s
visit
to
castle
marling
barbara
hare
called
at
miss
carlyle
s
and
found
them
going
to
tea
much
earlier
than
usual
we
dined
earlier
said
miss
corny
and
i
ordered
tea
as
soon
as
the
dinner
went
away
otherwise
archibald
would
have
taken
i
am
as
well
without
tea
and
i
have
a
mass
of
business
to
get
through
you
are
not
as
well
without
it
cried
miss
corny
and
i
don
t
choose
you
should
go
without
it
take
off
your
bonnet
barbara
he
does
things
like
nobody
else
he
is
off
to
castle
marling
and
never
could
open
his
lips
till
just
now
that
he
was
is
that
invalid
brewster
or
whatever
his
name
is
laid
up
at
castle
marling
still
exclaimed
barbara
he
is
still
there
said
carlyle
barbara
sprang
up
the
moment
tea
was
over
dill
is
waiting
for
me
in
the
office
and
i
have
some
hours
work
before
me
however
i
suppose
you
won
t
care
to
put
up
with
peter
s
attendance
so
make
haste
with
your
bonnet
she
took
his
arm
and
they
walked
on
carlyle
striking
the
hedge
and
the
grass
with
her
parasol
another
minute
and
the
handle
was
in
two
i
thought
you
would
do
it
said
barbara
while
he
was
regarding
the
parasol
with
ludicrous
dismay
never
mind
it
is
an
old
i
will
bring
you
another
to
replace
it
what
is
the
color
brown
i
won
t
forget
hold
the
relics
a
minute
he
put
the
pieces
in
her
hand
and
taking
out
a
note
case
made
a
note
in
pencil
what
s
that
for
she
inquired
he
held
it
close
to
her
eyes
that
she
might
discern
what
he
had
written
brown
parasol
a
reminder
for
me
barbara
in
case
i
barbara
s

slip

well

closed

two
or
three
mornings
after

affectionate

hoax
was
the
first
gutteral
sound
that
escaped
from
miss
carlyle
s
throat
when
speech
came
to
her
dill
only
stood
like
a
stone
image
it
is
a
hoax
i
say
raved
miss
carlyle
what
are
you
standing
there
for
like
a
gander
on
one
leg
she
reiterated
venting
her
anger
upon
the
unoffending
man
is
it
a
hoax
or
not
i
am
overdone
with
amazement
miss
corny
it
is
not
a
hoax
i
have
had
a
letter
it
can
t
be
true
it
can
t
be
true
he
had
no
more
thought
of
being
married
when
he
left
here
three
days
ago
than
i
how
can
we
tell
that
miss
corny
how
are
we
to
know
he
did
not
go
to
be
married
i
fancy
he
go
to
be
married
shrieked
miss
corny
in
a
passion
he
would
not
be
such
a
fool
and
to
that
fine
no
he
has
sent
this
to
be
put
in
the
county
journals
said
dill
holding
forth
a
scrap
of
paper
they
are
married
safe
miss
carlyle
took
it
and
held
it
before
her
her
hand
was
cold
as
ice
and
shook
as
if
with
palsy
on
the
at
castle
marling
by
the
chaplain
to
the
earl
of
mount
severn

the
lady

only
child
of
william

earl
of

miss
carlyle
tore
the
paper
to
atoms
and
scattered
it
dill
afterward
made
copies
from
memory
and
sent
them
to
the
journal
offices
but
let
that

will
never
forgive

deliberately
uttered

i
will
never

chapter
xiv
the
earl
s
astonishment
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
in
the
newspapers
was
the
first
intimation
of
it
lord
mount
severn
received
he
was
little
less
thunderstruck
than
miss
corny
and
came
steaming
to
england
the
same
day
thereby
missing
his
wife
s
letter
which
gave
her
version
of
the
affair
he
met
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
in
london
where
they
were
staying
at
one
of
the
hotels
only
for
a
day
or
two
however
for
they
were
going
further
isabel
was
alone
when
the
earl
was
announced
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
isabel
began
he
without
the
circumlocution
of
greeting
you
are
married
yes
she
answered
with
her
pretty
innocent
blush
some
time
and
to
carlyle
the
lawyer
how
did
it
come
about
isabel
began
to
think
how
it
did
come
about
sufficiently
to
give
a
clear
answer
he
asked
me
she
said
and
i
accepted
him
he
came
to
castle
marling
at
easter
and
asked
me
then
i
was
very
much
the
earl
looked
at
her
attentively
why
was
i
kept
in
ignorance
of
this
isabel
i
did
not
know
you
were
kept
in
ignorance
of
it
carlyle
wrote
to
you
as
did
lady
mount
lord
mount
severn
was
a
man
in
the
dark
and
looked
like
it
i
suppose
this
comes
soliloquized
he
aloud
of
your
father
s
having
allowed
the
gentleman
to
dance
daily
attendance
at
east
lynne
and
so
you
fell
in
love
with
indeed
no
answered
she
in
an
amused
tone
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
falling
in
love
with
then
don
t
you
love
him
abruptly
asked
the
earl
no
she
whispered
timidly
but
i
like
him
much
oh
very
much
and
he
is
so
good
to
me
the
earl
stroked
his
chin
and
mused
isabel
had
destroyed
the
only
reasonable
conclusion
he
had
been
able
to
come
to
as
to
the
motives
for
the
hasty
marriage
if
you
do
not
love
carlyle
how
comes
it
that
you
are
so
wise
in
the
distinction
between
liking
and
love
it
can
not
be
that
you
love
anybody
else
the
question
turned
home
and
isabel
turned
crimson
i
shall
love
my
husband
in
time
was
all
she
answered
as
she
bent
her
head
and
played
nervously
with
her
watch
chain
my
poor
child
involuntarily
exclaimed
the
earl
but
he
was
one
who
liked
to
fathom
the
depth
of
everything
who
has
been
staying
at
castle
marling
since
i
left
he
asked
sharply
mrs
levison
came
i
alluded
to
gentlemen
young
only
francis
levison
she
replied
francis
levison
you
have
never
been
so
foolish
as
to
fall
in
love
with
him
the
question
was
so
pointed
so
abrupt
and
isabel
s
moreover
so
great
that
she
betrayed
lamentable
confusion
and
the
earl
had
no
further
need
to
ask
pity
stole
into
his
hard
eyes
as
they
fixed
themselves
on
her
downcast
glowing
face
isabel
he
gravely
began
captain
levison
is
not
a
good
man
if
ever
you
were
inclined
to
think
him
one
dispossess
your
mind
of
the
idea
and
hold
him
at
arm
s
distance
drop
his
acquaintance
encourage
no
intimacy
with
i
have
already
dropped
it
said
isabel
and
i
shall
not
take
it
up
again
but
lady
mount
severn
must
think
well
of
him
or
she
would
not
have
him
she
thinks
none
too
well
of
him
none
can
of
francis
levison
returned
the
earl
significantly
before
isabel
could
reply
carlyle
entered
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
earl
the
earl
did
not
appear
to
see
it
isabel
said
he
i
am
sorry
to
turn
you
out
but
i
suppose
you
have
but
this
one
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
to
she
quitted
them
and
the
earl
wheeled
round
and
faced
carlyle
speaking
in
a
stern
haughty
tone
how
came
this
marriage
about
sir
do
you
possess
so
little
honor
that
taking
advantage
of
my
absence
you
must
intrude
yourself
into
my
family
and
clandestinely
espouse
lady
isabel
vane
carlyle
stood
confounded
and
confused
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
looking
every
whit
as
fearless
and
far
more
noble
than
the
peer
my
lord
i
do
not
understand
yet
i
speak
plainly
what
is
it
but
a
clandestine
procedure
to
take
advantage
of
a
guardian
s
absence
and
beguile
a
young
girl
into
a
marriage
beneath
her
there
has
been
nothing
clandestine
in
my
conduct
toward
lady
isabel
vane
there
shall
be
nothing
but
honor
in
my
conduct
toward
lady
isabel
carlyle
your
lordship
has
been
i
have
not
been
informed
at
all
retorted
the
earl
i
was
allowed
to
learn
this
from
the
public
papers
i
the
only
relative
of
lady
when
i
proposed
for
lady
isabel
but
a
month
ago
sarcastically
interrupted
the
earl
but
a
month
ago
calmly
repeated
carlyle
my
first
action
after
isabel
accepted
me
was
to
write
to
you
but
that
i
imagine
you
may
not
have
received
the
letter
by
stating
you
first
heard
of
our
marriage
through
the
papers
i
should
say
the
want
of
courtesy
lay
on
your
lordship
s
side
for
having
vouchsafed
me
no
reply
to
what
were
the
contents
of
the
letter
i
stated
what
had
occurred
mentioning
what
i
was
able
to
do
in
the
way
of
settlements
and
also
that
both
isabel
and
myself
wished
the
ceremony
to
take
place
as
soon
as
might
and
pray
where
did
you
address
the
letter
lady
mount
severn
could
not
give
me
the
address
she
said
if
i
would
intrust
the
letter
to
her
she
would
forward
it
with
the
rest
she
wrote
for
she
expected
daily
to
hear
from
you
i
did
give
her
the
letter
and
i
heard
no
more
of
the
matter
except
that
her
ladyship
sent
me
a
message
when
isabel
was
writing
to
me
that
as
you
had
returned
no
reply
you
of
course
is
this
the
fact
cried
the
earl
my
lord
coldly
replied
carlyle
whatever
may
be
my
defects
in
your
eyes
i
am
at
least
a
man
of
truth
until
this
moment
the
suspicion
that
you
were
in
ignorance
of
the
contemplated
marriage
never
occurred
to
so
far
then
i
beg
your
pardon
carlyle
but
how
came
the
marriage
about
at
all
how
came
it
to
be
hurried
over
in
this
unseemly
fashion
you
made
the
offer
at
easter
isabel
tells
me
and
you
married
her
three
weeks
after
and
i
would
have
married
her
and
brought
her
away
with
me
the
day
i
did
make
it
had
it
been
practicable
returned
carlyle
i
have
acted
throughout
for
her
comfort
and
oh
indeed
exclaimed
the
earl
returning
to
his
disagreeable
tone
perhaps
you
will
put
me
in
possession
of
the
facts
and
of
your
i
warn
you
that
the
facts
to
you
will
not
bear
a
pleasant
sound
lord
mount
allow
me
to
be
the
judge
of
that
said
the
earl
business
took
me
to
castle
marling
on
good
friday
on
the
following
day
i
called
at
your
house
after
your
own
and
isabel
s
invitation
it
was
natural
i
should
in
fact
it
would
have
been
a
breach
of
good
feeling
not
to
do
so
i
found
isabel
and
miserable
far
from
enjoying
a
happy
home
in
your
house
what
sir
interrupted
the
earl
and
miserable
even
to
blows
my
the
earl
stood
as
one
petrified
staring
at
carlyle
i
learnt
it
i
must
premise
through
the
chattering
revelations
of
your
little
son
isabel
of
course
would
not
have
mentioned
it
to
me
but
when
the
child
had
spoken
she
did
not
deny
it
in
short
she
was
too
too
completely
bowed
in
spirit
to
deny
it
it
aroused
all
my
feelings
of
indignation
it
excited
in
me
an
irresistible
desire
to
emancipate
her
from
this
cruel
life
and
take
her
where
she
would
find
affection
and
i
hope
happiness
there
was
only
one
way
which
i
could
do
this
and
i
risked
it
i
asked
her
to
become
my
wife
and
to
return
to
her
home
at
east
the
earl
was
slowly
recovering
from
his
petrifaction
then
am
i
to
understand
that
when
you
called
that
day
at
my
house
you
carried
no
intention
with
you
of
proposing
to
isabel
not
any
it
was
an
impromptu
step
the
circumstances
under
which
i
found
her
calling
it
the
earl
paced
the
room
perplexed
still
and
evidently
disturbed
may
i
inquire
if
you
love
her
he
abruptly
said
carlyle
paused
ere
he
spoke
and
a
red
flush
dyed
his
face
those
sort
of
feelings
man
rarely
acknowledges
to
man
lord
mount
severn
but
i
will
answer
you
i
do
love
her
passionately
and
sincerely
i
learnt
to
love
her
at
east
lynne
but
i
could
have
carried
my
love
silently
within
me
to
the
end
of
my
life
and
never
betrayed
it
and
probably
should
have
done
so
but
for
the
unexpected
visit
to
castle
marling
if
the
idea
of
making
her
my
wife
had
never
previously
occurred
to
me
as
practicable
it
was
that
i
deemed
her
rank
incompatible
with
my
as
it
was
said
the
earl
country
solicitors
have
married
peers
daughters
before
now
remarked
carlyle
i
only
add
another
to
the
but
you
can
not
keep
her
as
a
peer
s
daughter
i
presume
east
lynne
will
be
her
home
our
establishment
will
be
small
and
quiet
as
compared
with
her
father
s
i
explained
to
isabel
how
quiet
at
the
first
and
she
might
have
retracted
had
she
wished
i
explained
also
in
full
to
lady
mount
severn
east
lynne
will
descend
to
our
eldest
son
should
we
have
children
my
profession
is
most
lucrative
my
income
good
were
i
to
die
isabel
would
enjoy
east
lynne
and
about
three
thousand
pounds
per
annum
i
gave
these
details
in
the
letter
which
appears
to
have
the
earl
made
no
immediate
reply
he
was
absorbed
in
thought
your
lordship
perceives
i
hope
that
there
has
been
nothing
clandestine
in
my
conduct
to
lady
lord
mount
severn
held
out
his
hand
i
refused
my
hand
when
you
came
in
carlyle
as
you
may
have
observed
perhaps
you
will
refuse
yours
now
though
i
should
be
proud
to
shake
it
when
i
find
myself
in
the
wrong
i
am
not
above
acknowledging
the
fact
and
i
must
state
my
opinion
that
you
have
behaved
most
kindly
and
carlyle
smiled
and
put
his
hand
into
the
earl
s
the
latter
retained
it
while
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
of
course
i
can
not
be
ignorant
that
in
speaking
of
isabel
s
treatment
you
alluded
to
my
wife
has
it
transpired
beyond
yourselves
you
may
be
sure
that
neither
isabel
nor
myself
would
mention
it
we
shall
dismiss
it
from
among
our
reminiscences
let
it
be
as
though
you
had
never
heard
it
it
is
past
and
done
isabel
said
the
earl
as
he
was
departing
that
evening
for
he
remained
to
spend
the
day
with
them
i
came
here
this
morning
almost
prepared
to
strike
your
husband
and
i
go
away
honoring
him
be
a
good
and
faithful
wife
to
him
for
he
deserves
of
course
i
shall
she
answered
in
surprise
lord
mount
severn
steamed
on
to
castle
marling
and
there
he
had
a
stormy
interview
with
his
wife
so
stormy
that
the
sounds
penetrated
to
the
ears
of
the
domestics
he
left
again
the
same
day
in
anger
and
proceeded
to
mount
severn
he
will
have
time
to
cool
down
before
we
meet
in
london
was
the
comment
of
my
lady
chapter
xv
coming
home
miss
carlyle
having
resolved
upon
her
course
quitted
her
own
house
and
removed
to
east
lynne
with
peter
and
her
handmaidens
in
spite
of
dill
s
grieved
remonstrances
she
discharged
the
servants
whom
carlyle
had
engaged
all
save
one
man
on
a
friday
night
about
a
month
after
the
wedding
carlyle
and
his
wife
came
home
they
were
expected
and
miss
carlyle
went
through
the
hall
to
receive
them
and
stood
on
the
upper
steps
between
the
pillars
of
the
portico
an
elegant
chariot
with
four
was
drawing
up
miss
carlyle
compressed
her
lips
as
she
scanned
it
she
was
attired
in
a
handsome
dark
silk
dress
and
a
new
cap
her
anger
had
had
time
to
cool
down
in
the
last
month
and
her
strong
common
sense
told
her
that
the
wiser
plan
would
be
to
make
the
best
of
it
carlyle
came
up
the
steps
with
isabel
you
here
cornelia
that
was
kind
how
are
you
isabel
this
is
my
lady
isabel
put
forth
her
hand
and
miss
carlyle
condescended
to
touch
the
tips
of
her
fingers
i
hope
you
are
well
ma
am
she
jerked
out
carlyle
left
them
together
and
went
back
to
search
for
some
trifles
which
had
been
left
in
the
carriage
miss
carlyle
led
the
way
to
a
where
the
was
laid
you
would
like
to
go
upstairs
and
take
your
things
off
before
upper
ma
am
she
said
in
the
same
jerking
tone
to
lady

as

a
wink
all

ma

if

replied
lady
isabel
it
is
of
no
consequence
do
not
let
me
give
miss
carlyle
whisked
out
of
the
room
upon
what
errand
was
best
known
to
herself
and
in
the
hall
she
and
marvel
came
to
an
encounter
no
words
passed
but
each
eyed
the
other
grimly
marvel
was
very
stylish
with
five
flounces
to
her
dress
a
veil
and
a
parasol
meanwhile
lady
isabel
sat
down
and
burst
into
bitter
tears
and
sobs
a
chill
had
come
over
her
it
did
not
seem
like
coming
to
east
lynne
carlyle
entered
and
witnessed
the
grief
isabel
he
uttered
in
amazement
as
he
hastened
up
to
her
my
darling
what
ails
you
i
am
tired
i
think
she
gently
answered
and
coming
into
the
house
again
made
me
think
of
papa
i
should
like
to
go
to
my
rooms
archibald
but
i
don
t
know
which
they
neither
did
carlyle
know
but
miss
carlyle
came
whisking
in
again
and
said
the
best
rooms
those
next
the
library
should
she
go
up
with
my
lady
carlyle
preferred
to
go
himself
and
he
held
out
his
arm
to
isabel
she
drew
her
veil
over
her
face
as
she
passed
miss
carlyle
the
branches
were
not
lighted
and
the
room
looked
cold
and
comfortless
things
seem
all
sixes
and
sevens
in
the
house
remarked
carlyle
i
fancy
the
servants
must
have
misunderstood
my
letter
and
not
have
expected
us
until
on
returning
to
the
carlyle
inquired
the
cause
of
the
servants
negligence
i
sent
them
away
because
they
were
superfluous
encumbrances
hastily
replied
miss
carlyle
we
have
four
in
the
house
and
my
lady
has
brought
a
fine
maid
i
see
making
five
i
have
come
up
here
to
carlyle
felt
checkmated
he
had
always
bowed
to
the
will
of
miss
corny
but
he
had
an
idea
that
he
and
his
wife
should
be
better
without
her
and
your
house
he
exclaimed
i
have
let
it
furnished
the
people
enter
so
you
can
not
turn
me
out
of
east
lynne
into
the
road
or
to
furnished
lodgings
archibald
there
ll
be
enough
expense
without
our
keeping
on
two
houses
and
most
people
in
your
place
would
jump
at
the
prospect
of
my
living
here
your
wife
will
be
mistress
i
do
not
intend
to
take
her
honors
from
her
but
i
will
save
her
a
world
of
trouble
in
management
be
as
useful
to
her
as
a
housekeeper
she
will
be
glad
of
that
inexperienced
as
she
is
i
dare
say
she
never
gave
a
domestic
order
in
her
this
was
a
view
of
the
case
to
carlyle
so
plausibly
put
that
he
began
to
think
it
might
be
all
for
the
best
he
had
great
reverence
for
his
sister
s
judgment
force
of
habit
is
strong
upon
all
of
us
still
he
did
not
know
did
you
buy
that
fine
piano
which
has
arrived
angrily
asked
miss
carlyle
it
was
my
present
to
miss
corny
groaned
what
did
it
cost
the
cost
is
of
no
consequence
the
old
piano
here
was
a
bad
one
and
i
bought
a
what
did
it
cost
repeated
miss
carlyle
a
hundred
and
twenty
guineas
he
answered
obedience
to
her
will
was
yet
powerful
within
him
miss
corny
threw
up
her
hands
and
eyes
but
at
that
moment
peter
entered
with
some
hot
water
which
his
master
had
rung
for
carlyle
rose
and
looked
on
the
where
is
the
wine
peter
the
servant
put
it
out
port
and
sherry
carlyle
drank
a
glass
and
then
proceeded
to
mix
some
wine
and
water
shall
i
mix
some
for
you
cornelia
he
asked
i
ll
mix
for
myself
if
i
want
any
who
s
that
for
he
quitted
the
room
carrying
the
wine
and
water
and
entered
his
wife
s
she
was
sitting
half
buried
it
seemed
in
the
her
face
muffled
up
as
she
raised
it
he
saw
that
it
was
flushed
and
agitated
that
her
eyes
were
bright
and
her
frame
was
trembling
what
is
the
matter
he
hastily
asked
i
got
nervous
after
marvel
went
she
whispered
laying
hold
of
him
as
if
for
protection
from
terror
i
came
back
to
the
chair
and
covered
my
head
over
hoping
some
one
would
come
i
have
been
talking
to
cornelia
but
what
made
you
nervous
oh
i
was
very
foolish
i
kept
thinking
of
frightful
things
they
would
come
into
my
mind
do
not
blame
me
archibald
this
is
the
room
papa
died
blame
you
my
darling
he
uttered
with
deep
feeling
i
thought
of
a
dreadful
story
about
the
bats
that
the
servants
told
i
dare
say
you
never
heard
it
and
i
kept
thinking
suppose
they
were
at
the
windows
now
behind
the
and
then
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
the
bed
i
fancied
i
might
see
you
are
laughing
yes
he
was
smiling
for
he
knew
that
these
moments
of
nervous
fear
are
best
met
jestingly
he
made
her
drink
the
wine
and
water
and
then
he
showed
her
where
the
bell
was
ringing
it
as
he
did
so
its
position
had
been
changed
in
some
late
alterations
to
the
house
your
rooms
shall
be
changed
no
let
us
remain
in
these
i
shall
like
to
feel
that
papa
was
once
their
occupant
i
won
t
get
nervous
but
even
as
she
spoke
her
actions
belied
her
words
carlyle
had
gone
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
she
flew
close
up
to
him
cowering
behind
him
shall
you
be
gone
very
long
archibald
she
whispered
not
more
than
an
hour
he
answered
but
he
hastily
put
back
one
of
his
hands
and
held
her
tightly
in
his
protecting
grasp
marvel
was
coming
along
the
corridor
in
answer
to
the
ring
have
the
goodness
to
let
miss
carlyle
know
that
i
am
not
coming
down
again
he
said
yes
carlyle
shut
the
door
and
then
looked
at
his
wife
and
laughed
he
is
very
kind
to
me
thought
isabel
with
the
morning
began
the
perplexities
of
lady
isabel
carlyle
but
first
of
all
just
fancy
the
group
at
breakfast
miss
carlyle
descended
in
the
startling
costume
the
reader
has
seen
took
her
seat
at
the
and
there
sat
bolt
upright
carlyle
came
down
next
and
then
lady
isabel
entered
in
an
elegant
dress
with
flowing
black
ribbons
good
morning
ma
am
i
hope
you
slept
well
was
miss
carlyle
s
salutation
quite
well
thank
you
she
answered
as
she
took
her
seat
opposite
miss
carlyle
miss
carlyle
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
table
that
is
your
place
ma
am
but
i
will
pour
out
the
coffee
and
save
you
the
trouble
if
you
wish
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
answered
lady
isabel
so
miss
carlyle
proceeded
to
her
duties
very
stern
and
grim
the
meal
was
nearly
over
when
peter
came
in
and
said
the
butcher
had
come
up
for
orders
miss
carlyle
looked
at
lady
isabel
waiting
of
course
for
her
to
give
them
isabel
was
silent
with
perplexity
she
had
never
given
such
an
order
in
her
life
totally
ignorant
was
she
of
the
requirements
of
a
household
and
did
not
know
whether
to
suggest
a
few
pounds
of
meat
or
a
whole
cow
it
was
the
presence
of
that
grim
miss
corny
which
put
her
out
alone
with
her
husband
she
would
have
said
what
ought
i
to
order
archibald
tell
peter
waited
a
something
to
roast
and
boil
if
you
please
stammered
lady
isabel
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
embarrassment
makes
cowards
of
us
and
carlyle
repeated
it
after
her
he
knew
no
more
about
housekeeping
than
she
did
something
to
roast
and
boil
tell
the
man
up
started
miss
corny
she
could
not
stand
that
are
you
aware
lady
isabel
that
an
order
such
as
that
would
only
puzzle
the
butcher
shall
i
give
the
necessary
orders
for
the
fishmonger
will
be
here
presently
oh
i
wish
you
would
cried
the
relieved
lady
isabel
i
have
not
been
accustomed
to
it
but
i
must
learn
i
don
t
think
i
know
anything
about
miss
corny
s
answer
was
to
stalk
from
the
room
isabel
rose
from
her
chair
like
a
bird
released
from
its
cage
and
stood
by
his
side
have
you
finished
archibald
i
think
i
have
dear
oh
here
s
my
coffee
there
i
have
finished
let
us
go
around
the
he
rose
laid
his
hands
playfully
on
her
slender
waist
and
looked
at
her
you
may
as
well
ask
me
to
take
a
journey
to
the
moon
it
is
past
nine
and
i
have
not
been
to
the
office
for
a
the
tears
rose
in
her
eyes
i
wish
you
would
be
always
with
me
east
lynne
will
not
be
east
lynne
without
i
will
be
with
you
as
much
as
ever
i
can
my
dearest
he
whispered
come
and
walk
with
me
through
the
she
ran
for
her
bonnet
gloves
and
parasol
carlyle
waited
for
her
in
the
hall
and
they
went
out
together
he
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
speak
about
his
sister
she
wishes
to
remain
with
us
he
said
i
do
not
know
what
to
decide
on
the
one
hand
i
think
she
might
save
you
the
worry
of
household
management
on
the
other
i
fancy
we
shall
be
happier
by
isabel
s
heart
sank
within
her
at
the
idea
of
that
stern
miss
corny
mounted
over
her
as
resident
guard
but
refined
and
sensitive
almost
painfully
considerate
of
the
feelings
of
others
she
raised
no
word
of
objection
as
you
and
miss
carlyle
please
she
answered
isabel
he
said
i
wish
it
to
be
as
you
please
i
wish
matters
to
be
arranged
as
may
best
please
you
and
i
will
have
them
so
arranged
my
chief
object
in
life
now
is
your
he
spoke
in
all
the
sincerity
of
truth
and
isabel
knew
it
and
the
thought
came
across
her
that
with
him
by
her
side
her
loving
protector
miss
carlyle
could
not
mar
her
life
s
peace
let
her
stay
archibald
she
will
not
incommode
at
any
rate
it
can
be
tried
for
a
month
or
two
and
we
shall
see
how
it
works
he
musingly
observed
they
reached
the
park
gates
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
and
be
your
clerk
she
cried
unwilling
to
release
his
hand
i
should
not
have
all
that
long
way
to
go
back
by
he
laughed
and
shook
his
head
telling
her
that
she
wanted
to
bribe
him
into
taking
her
back
but
it
could
not
be
and
away
he
went
after
saying
farewell
chapter
xvi
domestic
troubles
isabel
wandered
back
and
then
wandered
through
the
rooms
they
looked
lonely
not
as
they
had
seemed
to
look
in
her
father
s
time
in
her
knelt
marvel
unpacking
she
rose
when
lady
isabel
entered
can
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
if
you
please
my
lady
what
is
it
then
marvel
poured
forth
her
tale
that
she
feared
so
small
an
establishment
would
not
suit
her
and
if
my
lady
pleased
she
would
like
to
leave
at
once
that
day
anticipating
it
she
had
not
unpacked
her
things
there
has
been
some
mistake
about
the
servants
marvel
but
it
will
be
remedied
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
told
you
before
i
married
that
carlyle
s
establishment
would
be
a
limited
my
lady
perhaps
i
could
put
up
with
that
but
i
never
could
stop
in
the
house
with
that
female
guy
had
been
on
the
tip
of
marvel
s
tongue
but
she
remembered
in
time
of
whom
she
was
speaking
with
miss
carlyle
i
fear
my
lady
we
have
both
got
tempers
that
would
slash
and
might
be
flying
at
each
other
i
could
not
stop
my
lady
for
untold
gold
and
if
you
please
to
make
me
forfeit
my
running
month
s
salary
why
i
must
do
it
so
when
i
have
set
your
ladyship
s
things
to
rights
i
hope
you
ll
allow
me
to
lady
isabel
would
not
condescend
to
ask
her
to
remain
but
she
wondered
how
she
should
manage
the
inconvenience
she
drew
her
desk
toward
her
what
is
the
amount
due
to
you
she
inquired
as
she
unlocked
it
up
to
the
end
of
the
quarter
my
lady
cried
marvel
in
a
brisk
tone
no
coldly
answered
lady
isabel
up
to
i
have
not
had
time
to
reckon
my
lady
isabel
took
a
pencil
and
paper
made
out
the
account
and
laid
it
down
in
gold
and
silver
on
the
table
it
is
more
than
you
deserve
marvel
she
remarked
and
more
than
you
would
get
in
most
places
you
ought
to
have
given
me
proper
marvel
melted
into
tears
and
began
a
string
of
excuses
she
should
never
have
wished
to
leave
so
kind
a
lady
but
for
attendant
conveniences
and
she
hoped
my
lady
would
not
object
to
testify
to
her
lady
isabel
quitted
the
room
in
the
midst
of
it
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
marvel
took
her
departure
joyce
telling
her
that
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
i
couldn
t
help
myself
retorted
marvel
and
i
am
sorry
to
leave
her
for
she
s
a
pleasant
young
lady
to
well
i
know
i
d
have
helped
myself
was
joyce
s
remark
i
would
not
go
off
in
this
unhandsome
way
from
a
good
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
loftily
returned
marvel
but
my
inside
feelings
are
delicate
and
can
t
bear
to
be
trampled
upon
the
same
house
is
not
going
to
hold
me
and
that
tall
female
image
who
s
more
fit
to
be
carried
about
at
a
foreign
carnival
than
some
that
they
do
so
marvel
left
and
when
lady
isabel
went
to
her
room
to
dress
for
dinner
joyce
entered
it
i
am
not
much
accustomed
to
a
lady
s
maid
s
duties
began
she
but
miss
carlyle
has
sent
me
my
lady
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
if
you
will
allow
isabel
thought
it
was
kind
of
miss
carlyle
and
if
you
please
to
trust
me
with
the
keys
of
your
things
i
will
take
charge
of
them
for
you
my
lady
until
you
are
suited
with
a
maid
joyce
resumed
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
keys
answered
isabel
i
never
keep
joyce
did
her
best
and
lady
isabel
went
down
it
was
nearly
six
o
clock
the
dinner
hour
and
she
strolled
to
the
park
gates
hoping
to
meet
carlyle
taking
a
few
steps
out
she
looked
down
the
road
but
could
not
see
him
coming
so
she
turned
in
again
and
sat
down
under
a
shady
tree
out
of
view
of
the
road
it
was
remarkably
warm
weather
for
the
closing
days
of
may
half
an
hour
and
then
carlyle
came
pelting
up
passed
the
gates
and
turned
on
to
the
grass
there
he
saw
his
wife
she
had
fallen
asleep
her
head
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
her
bonnet
and
parasol
lay
at
her
feet
her
scarf
had
dropped
and
she
looked
like
a
lovely
child
her
lips
partly
open
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
beautiful
hair
falling
around
it
was
an
exquisite
picture
and
his
heart
beat
quicker
within
him
as
he
felt
that
it
was
all
his
own
a
smile
stole
to
his
lips
as
he
stood
looking
at
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
for
a
minute
could
not
remember
where
she
was
then
she
started
up
oh
archibald
have
i
been
asleep
ay
and
might
have
been
stolen
and
carried
off
i
could
not
afford
that
i
don
t
know
how
it
came
about
i
was
listening
for
what
have
you
been
doing
all
day
he
asked
as
he
drew
her
arm
within
his
and
they
walked
on
oh
i
hardly
know
she
sighed
trying
the
new
piano
and
looking
at
my
watch
wishing
the
time
would
go
quicker
that
you
might
come
home
the
ponies
and
carriage
have
arrived
i
know
they
have
my
dear
have
you
been
out
of
doors
much
no
i
waited
for
and
then
she
told
him
about
marvel
he
felt
vexed
saying
she
must
replace
her
with
all
speed
isabel
said
she
knew
of
one
a
young
woman
who
had
left
lady
mount
severn
while
she
isabel
was
at
castle
marling
her
health
was
delicate
and
lady
mount
severn
s
place
too
hard
for
her
she
might
suit
write
to
her
said
carlyle
the
carriage
came
round
a
beautiful
little
equipage
and
isabel
was
ready
as
carlyle
drove
slowly
down
the
dusty
road
they
came
upon
miss
corny
striding
along
in
the
sun
with
a
great
umbrella
over
her
head
she
would
not
turn
to
look
at
them
once
more
as
in
the
year
gone
by
jude
s
church
was
in
a
flutter
of
expectation
it
expected
to
see
a
whole
paraphernalia
of
bridal
finery
and
again
it
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
isabel
had
not
put
off
the
mourning
for
her
father
she
was
in
black
a
thin
gauze
dress
and
her
white
bonnet
had
small
black
flowers
inside
and
out
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
carlyle
took
possession
of
the
pew
belonging
to
east
lynne
filling
the
place
where
the
poor
earl
used
to
sit
not
so
miss
corny
she
sat
in
her
own
barbara
was
there
with
the
justice
and
hare
her
face
wore
a
gray
dusky
hue
of
which
she
was
only
too
conscious
but
could
not
subdue
her
covetous
eyes
would
wander
to
that
other
face
with
its
singular
loveliness
and
its
sweetly
earnest
eyes
sheltered
under
the
protection
of
him
for
whose
sheltering
protection
she
had
so
long
yearned
poor
barbara
did
not
benefit
much
by
the
services
that
day
afterward
they
went
across
the
churchyard
to
the
west
corner
where
stood
the
tomb
of
lord
mount
severn
isabel
looked
at
the
inscription
her
veil
shading
her
face
not
here
and
now
my
darling
he
whispered
pressing
her
arm
to
his
side
for
he
felt
her
silent
sobs
strive
for
it
seems
but
the
other
day
he
was
at
church
with
me
and
now
here
carlyle
suddenly
changed
their
places
so
that
they
stood
with
their
backs
to
the
hedge
and
to
any
staring
stragglers
who
might
be
lingering
on
the
road
there
ought
to
be
railings
round
the
tomb
she
presently
said
after
a
successful
battle
with
her
emotion
i
thought
so
and
i
suggested
it
to
lord
mount
severn
but
he
appeared
to
think
differently
i
will
have
it
i
put
you
to
great
expense
she
said
taking
one
thing
with
carlyle
glanced
quickly
at
her
a
dim
fear
penetrating
his
mind
that
his
sister
might
have
been
talking
in
her
hearing
an
expense
i
would
not
be
without
for
the
whole
world
you
know
it
and
i
have
nothing
to
repay
you
with
she
sighed
he
looked
expressively
amused
and
gazing
into
her
face
the
expression
of
his
eyes
made
her
smile
here
is
john
with
the
carriage
she
exclaimed
let
us
go
standing
outside
the
gates
talking
to
the
rector
s
family
were
several
ladies
one
of
them
barbara
hare
she
watched
carlyle
place
his
wife
in
the
carriage
she
watched
him
drive
away
barbara
s
lips
were
white
as
she
bowed
in
return
to
his
greeting
the
heat
is
so
great
murmured
barbara
when
those
around
noticed
her
paleness
ah
you
ought
to
have
gone
in
the
phaeton
with
and
hare
as
they
desired
i
wished
to
walk

the
unhappy

a
pretty

to
pour
to
east
lynne
to

the
wedding
visit
as
it
is
called
to
and
lady
isabel
carlyle
of
course
they
displayed
themselves
in
their
most
courtly
state
carlyle
always
a
popular
man
had
gained
double
his
former
importance
by
his
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
late
earl
of
mount
severn
among
the
earliest
visitors
went
justice
and
hare
with
barbara
isabel
was
in
her
attended
by
joyce
whom
she
was
just
asking
to
take
the
place
of
her
late
maid
if
miss
carlyle
would
consent
to
the
transfer
joyce
s
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
at
the
proposal
oh
my
lady
you
are
very
kind
i
should
so
like
it
i
would
serve
you
faithfully
to
the
best
of
my
isabel
laughed
but
miss
carlyle
may
not
be
inclined
to
transfer
i
think
she
would
be
my
lady
she
said
a
day
or
two
ago
that
i
appeared
to
suit
you
and
you
might
have
me
altogether
if
you
wished
provided

could
still
make
her
gowns

make
them

please
her

see
my
do
you
make
her
caps
also
demurely
asked
lady
isabel
joyce
smiled
yes
my
lady
but
i
am
allowed
to
make
them
only
according
to
her
own
joyce
if
you
become
my
maid
you
must
wear
smarter
caps
yourself
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
fine
like
oh
my
lady
i
shall
never
be
fine
shuddered
joyce
and
joyce
believed
she
had
cause
to
shudder
at
finery
she
was
about
to
speak
further
when
a
knock
came
to
the
door
joyce
went
to
open
it
and
saw
one
of
the
housemaids
a
girl
who
had
recently
been
engaged
a
native
of
west
lynne
isabel
heard
the
colloquy
is
my
lady
there
some
visitors
pete
ordered
me
to
come
and
tell
you
i
say
joyce
it
s
the
hares
and
she
s
with
them
i
watched
her
get
out
of
the
who
sharply
returned
joyce
why
miss
barbara
only
fancy
her
coming
to
pay
the
wedding
visit
here
my
lady
had
better
take
care
that
she
don
t
get
a
bowl
of
poison
mixed
for
her
master
s
out
or
else
i
d
have
given
a
shilling
to
see
the
interview
between
the
joyce
sent
the
girl
away
shut
the
door
and
turned
to
her
mistress
quite
unconscious
that
the
conversation
had
been
audible
some
visitors
are
in
the
my
lady
susan
says
justice
hare
and
hare
and
miss
isabel
descended
her
mind
full
of
the
mysterious
words
spoken
by
susan
the
justice
was
in
a
new
flaxen
wig
and
pompous
hare
pale
delicate
and
barbara
beautiful
such
was
the
impression
they
made
upon
isabel
they
paid
rather
a
long
visit
isabel
quite
falling
in
love
with
the
gentle
and
suffering
hare
and
had
risen
to
leave
when
miss
carlyle
entered
she
wished
them
to
remain
longer
had
something
she
said
to
show
barbara
the
justice
declined
he
had
a
brother
justice
coming
to
dine
with
him
at
five
and
it
was
then
four
barbara
might
stop
if
she
liked
barbara
s
faced
turned
crimson
but
nevertheless
she
accepted
the
invitation
immediately
proffered
her
by
miss
carlyle
to
remain
at
east
lynne
for
the
rest
of
the
day
dinner
time
approached
and
isabel
went
to
dress
for
it
joyce
was
waiting
and
entered
upon
the
subject
of
the
service
my
lady
i
have
spoken
to
miss
carlyle
and
she
is
willing
that
i
should
be
transferred
to
you
but
she
says
i
ought
first
to
acquaint
you
with
certain
unpleasant
facts
in
my
history
and
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
me
miss
carlyle
is
not
over
pleasant
in
manner
my
lady
but
she
is
very
upright
and
what
facts
asked
lady
isabel
sitting
down
to
have
her
hair
brushed
my
lady
i
ll
tell
you
as
shortly
as
it
can
my
father
was
a
clerk
in
carlyle
s
office
of
course
i
mean
the
late
carlyle
my
mother
died
when
i
was
eight
years
old
and
my
father
afterwards
married
again
a
sister
of
kane
s
wife
mr
kane
the
music
master
yes
my
lady
she
and
kane
were
quite
ladies
had
been
governesses
people
said
she
lowered
herself
greatly
in
marrying
my
father
however
they
did
marry
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
my
little
sister
afy
was
born
we
lived
in
a
pretty
cottage
in
the
wood
and
were
happy
but
in
twelve
months
more
my
died
and
an
aunt
of
hers
adopted
afy
i
lived
with
my
father
going
to
school
then
to
learn
dressmaking
and
finally
going
out
to
work
to
ladies
houses
after
many
years
afy
came
home
her
aunt
had
died
and
her
income
with
her
but
not
the
vanity
and
love
of
finery
that
afy
had
acquired
she
did
nothing
but
dress
herself
and
read
novels
my
father
was
angry
he
said
no
good
could
come
of
it
she
had
several
admirers
richard
hare
miss
barbara
s
own
brother
continued
joyce
lowering
her
voice
and
she
flirted
with
them
all
my
father
used
to
go
out
to
shoot
on
fine
evenings
after
office
or
to
his
duties
as
secretary
to
the
library
and
so
afy
was
generally
all
alone
until
i
came
home
at
nine
o
clock
and
was
free
to
flirt
with
her
had
she
any
she
favored
particularly
was
it
thought
asked
lady
isabel
the
chief
one
my
lady
was
richard
hare
she
got
acquainted
with
somebody
else
a
stranger
who
used
to
ride
over
from
a
distance
to
see
her
but
i
fancy
there
was
nothing
in
it
richard
was
the
one
and
it
went
on
till
till
he
killed
her
who
uttered
the
startled
isabel
richard
hare
my
lady
father
had
told
afy
that
richard
should
not
come
there
any
longer
for
when
gentlemen
go
in
secret
after
poor
girls
it
s
well
known
they
have
not
got
marriage
in
their
thoughts
father
would
have
interfered
more
than
he
did
but
that
he
judged
well
of
richard
and
did
not
think
he
was
one
to
do
afy
real
harm
but
he
did
not
know
how
flighty
she
was
however
one
day
he
heard
people
talk
about
it
in
west
lynne
coupling
her
name
and
richard
s
offensively
together
and
at
night
he
told
afy
before
me
that
it
should
not
go
on
any
longer
and
she
must
not
encourage
him
my
lady
the
next
night
richard
hare
shot
my
how
very
dreadful
whether
it
was
done
on
purpose
or
that
they
had
a
scuffle
and
the
gun
went
off
accidentally
and
killed
my
father
no
one
can
tell
afy
said
she
had
been
in
the
woods
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
when
she
came
in
father
lay
dead
and
locksley
was
standing
over
him
he
said
he
had
heard
the
shot
and
come
up
just
in
time
to
see
richard
fly
from
the
house
his
shoes
covered
with
blood
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since
but
there
is
a
judgment
of
murder
out
against
him
and
the
fear
and
shame
is
killing
his
mother
by
and
afy
the
worst
is
to
come
my
lady
afy
followed
him
directly
after
the
inquest
and
nothing
has
been
known
since
of
either
of
them
i
was
taken
ill
after
all
these
shocks
with
nervous
fever
and
miss
carlyle
took
care
of
me
and
i
have
remained
with
her
ever
since
this
was
what
i
had
to
tell
you
my
lady
before
you
decided
to
take
me
into
service
it
is
not
every
lady
who
would
like
to
engage
one
whose
sister
has
turned
out
so
lady
isabel
did
not
see
that
it
could
make
any
difference
or
that
it
ought
to
she
said
so
and
then
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
mused
what
dress
my
lady
joyce
what
was
that
i
heard
you
and
susan
gossiping
over
at
the
door
lady
isabel
suddenly
asked
about
miss
hare
giving
me
a
bowl
of
poison
something
in
the
dramatic
line
that
would
be
you
should
tell
susan
not
to
make
her
whispers
so
it
was
only
a
bit
of
nonsense
my
lady
these
ignorant
servants
will
talk
and
every
one
at
west
lynne
knew
miss
barbara
was
in
love
with
carlyle
but
i
don
t
fancy
she
would
have
been
the
one
to
make
him
happy
with
all
her
a
hot
flush
passed
over
the
brow
of
lady
isabel
a
sensation
very
like
jealousy
flew
to
her
heart
no
woman
likes
to
hear
of
another
s
being
or
having
been
attached
to
her
husband
a
doubt
always
arises
whether
the
feeling
may
not
have
been
reciprocated
lady
isabel
descended
she
wore
a
costly
black
lace
dress
its
low
body
and
sleeves
trimmed
with
as
costly
white
and
ornaments
of
jet
she
looked
inexpressibly
beautiful
and
barbara
turned
from
her
with
a
feeling
of
sinking
jealousy
from
her
beauty
from
her
attire
even
from
the
fine
soft
handkerchief
which
displayed
the
badge
of
her
rank
the
coronet
of
an
earl
s
daughter
barbara
looked
well
too
she
was
in
a
light
blue
silk
robe
and
her
pretty
cheeks
were
damask
with
her
mind
s
excitement
on
her
neck
she
wore
the
gold
chain
given
her
by
carlyle
strange
that
she
had
not
discarded
that
they
stood
together
at
the
window
looking
at
carlyle
as
he
came
up
the
avenue
he
saw
them
and
nodded
lady
isabel
watched
the
damask
cheeks
turn
to
crimson
at
sight
of
him
how
do
you
do
barbara
he
cried
as
he
shook
hands
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
at
last
you
have
been
rather
tardy
over
it
and
how
are
you
my
darling
he
whispered
over
his
wife
but
she
missed
his
kiss
of
greeting
well
would
she
have
had
him
give
it
her
in
public
no
but
she
was
in
the
mood
to
notice
the
omission
dinner
over
miss
carlyle
beguiled
barbara
out
of
doors
barbara
would
far
rather
have
remained
in
his
presence
of
course
they
discussed
lady
isabel
how
do
you
like
her
abruptly
asked
barbara
alluding
to
lady
isabel
better
than
i
thought
i
should
acknowledged
miss
carlyle
i
had
expected
airs
and
graces
and
pretence
and
i
must
say
she
is
free
from
them
she
seems
quite
wrapped
up
in
archibald
and
watches
for
his
coming
home
like
a
cat
watches
for
a
mouse
she
is
dull
without
barbara
compelled
her
manner
to
indifference
i
suppose
it
is
i
suppose
it
is
absurd
was
the
retort
of
miss
carlyle
i
give
them
little
of
my
company
especially
in
an
evening
they
go
strolling
out
together
or
she
sings
to
him
he
hanging
over
her
as
if
she
were
of
gold
to
judge
by
appearances
she
is
more
precious
to
him
than
any
gold
that
was
ever
coined
into
money
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
saw
last
night
archibald
had
what
he
is
not
often
subject
to
a
severe
headache
and
he
went
into
the
next
room
after
dinner
and
lay
on
the
sofa
she
carried
a
cup
of
tea
to
him
and
never
came
back
leaving
her
own
on
the
table
till
it
was
perfectly
cold
i
pushed
open
the
door
to
tell
her
so
there
was
my
lady
s
cambric
handkerchief
soaked
in
lying
on
his
forehead
and
there
was
my
lady
herself
kneeling
down
and
looking
at
him
he
with
his
arm
thrown
around
her
there
now
i
just
ask
you
barbara
whether
there
s
any
sense
in
fadding
with
a
man
like
that
if
ever
he
did
have
a
headache
before
he
was
married
i
used
to
mix
him
up
a
good
dose
of
salts
and
senna
and
tell
him
to
go
to
bed
early
and
sleep
the
pain
barbara
made
no
reply
but
she
turned
her
face
from
miss
carlyle
on
barbara
s
return
to
the
house
she
found
that
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
were
in
the
adjoining
room
at
the
piano
and
barbara
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
that
sweet
voice
she
did
as
miss
carlyle
confessed
to
have
done
pushed
open
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
and
looked
in
it
was
the
twilight
hour
almost
too
dusk
to
see
but
she
could
distinguish
isabel
seated
at
the
piano
and
carlyle
standing
behind
her
she
was
singing
one
of
the
ballads
from
the
opera
of
the
bohemian
girl
when
other
why
do
you
like
that
song
so
much
archibald
she
asked
when
she
had
finished
it
i
don
t
know
i
never
liked
it
so
much
until
i
heard
it
from
i
wonder
if
they
are
come
in
shall
we
go
into
the
next
room
just
this
one
first
this
translation
from
the
german
twere
vain
to
tell
thee
all
i
there
s
real
music
in
that
yes
there
is
do
you
know
archibald
your
taste
is
just
like
papa
s
he
liked
all
these
quiet
imaginative
songs
and
so
do
you
and
so
do
i
she
laughingly
added
if
i
must
speak
the
she
ceased
and
began
the
song
singing
it
exquisitely
in
a
low
sweet
earnest
tone
the
chords
of
the
accompaniment
at
its
conclusion
dying
off
gradually
into
silence
there
archibald
i
am
sure
i
have
sung
you
ten
songs
at
least
she
said
leaning
her
head
back
against
him
and
looking
at
him
from
her
upturned
face
you
ought
to
pay
he
did
pay
her
holding
the
dear
face
to
him
and
taking
from
it
some
impassioned
kisses
barbara
turned
to
the
window
a
low
moan
of
pain
escaping
her
as
she
pressed
her
forehead
on
one
of
its
panes
and
looked
forth
at
the
dusky
night
isabel
came
in
on
her
husband
s
arm
are
you
here
alone
miss
hare
i
really
beg
your
pardon
i
supposed
you
were
with
miss
where
is
cornelia
barbara
i
have
just
come
in
was
barbara
s
reply
i
dare
say
she
is
following
so
she
was
for
she
entered
a
moment
after
her
voice
raised
in
anger
at
the
gardener
who
had
disobeyed
her
orders
and
obeyed
the
wishes
of
lady
isabel
the
evening
wore
on
to
ten
and
as
the
struck
the
hour
barbara
rose
from
her
chair
in
amazement
i
did
not
think
it
was
so
late
surely
some
one
must
have
come
for
i
will
inquire
was
lady
isabel
s
answer
and
carlyle
touched
the
bell
no
one
had
come
for
miss
hare
then
i
fear
i
must
trouble
peter
cried
barbara
mamma
may
be
gone
to
rest
tired
and
papa
must
have
forgotten
me
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
get
locked
out
she
gaily
added
as
you
were
one
night
before
said
carlyle
significantly
he
alluded
to
the
night
when
barbara
was
in
the
grove
of
trees
with
her
unfortunate
brother
and
hare
was
on
the
point
unconsciously
of
locking
her
out
she
had
given
carlyle
the
history
but
its
recollection
now
called
up
a
smart
pain
and
a
change
passed
over
her
face
oh
don
t
archibald
she
uttered
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
don
t
recall
isabel
wondered
can
peter
take
me
continued
barbara
i
had
better
take
you
said
carlyle
it
is
barbara
s
heart
beat
at
the
words
beat
as
she
put
her
things
on
as
she
said
to
lady
isabel
and
miss
carlyle
it
beat
to
throbbing
as
she
went
out
with
him
and
took
his
arm
all
just
as
it
used
to
be
only
now
that
he
was
the
husband
of
another
only
it
was
a
warm
lovely
june
night
not
moonlight
but
bright
with
its
summer
twilight
they
went
down
the
park
into
the
road
which
they
crossed
and
soon
came
to
a
stile
from
that
stile
there
led
a
path
through
the
fields
which
would
pass
the
back
of
justice
hare
s
barbara
stopped
at
it
would
you
choose
the
field
way
barbara
the
grass
will
be
damp
and
this
is
the
longest
but
we
shall
escape
the
dust
of
the
oh
very
well
if
you
prefer
it
it
will
not
make
three
minutes
he
is
very
anxious
to
get
home
to
her
mentally
exclaimed
barbara
i
shall
fly
out
upon
him
presently
or
my
heart
will
carlyle
crossed
the
stile
helped
over
barbara
and
then
gave
her
his
arm
again
he
had
taken
her
parasol
as
he
had
taken
it
the
last
night
they
had
walked
together
an
elegant
little
parasol
this
of
blue
silk
and
white
lace
and
he
did
not
switch
the
hedges
with
it
that
night
was
present
to
barbara
now
with
all
its
words
and
its
delusive
hopes
terribly
present
to
her
was
their
bitter
ending
there
are
women
of
warm
impulsive
temperaments
who
can
scarcely
help
in
certain
moments
of
highly
wrought
excitement
the
bounds
of
nature
and
decorum
and
giving
the
reins
to
temper
tongue
and
imagination
making
a
scene
in
short
barbara
had
been
working
herself
into
this
state
during
the
whole
evening
the
affection
of
isabel
for
her
husband
her
voice
his
caresses
seen
through
the
half
open
doors
had
maddened
her
she
felt
it
impossible
to
restrain
her
excitement
carlyle
walked
on
utterly
unconscious
that
a
storm
was
brewing
more
than
that
he
was
unconscious
of
having
given
cause
for
one
and
dashed
into
an
indifferent
common
place
topic
in
the
most
provoking
manner
when
does
the
justice
begin
haymaking
barbara
there
was
no
reply
barbara
was
swelling
and
panting
and
trying
to
keep
her
emotion
down
carlyle
tried
again
barbara
i
asked
you
which
day
your
papa
cut
his
still
no
reply
barbara
was
literally
incapable
of
making
one
the
steam
of
excitement
was
on
nearly
to
its
highest
pitch
her
throat
was
working
the
muscles
of
her
mouth
began
to
twitch
and
a
convulsive
sob
or
what
sounded
like
it
broke
from
her
carlyle
turned
his
head
hastily
barbara
are
you
ill
what
is
it
on
it
came
passion
temper
wrongs
and
nervousness
all
boiling
over
together
she
shrieked
she
sobbed
she
was
in
strong
hysterics
carlyle
her
to
the
second
stile
and
placed
her
against
it
his
arm
supporting
her
and
an
old
cow
and
two
calves
wondering
what
the
disturbance
could
mean
at
that
sober
time
of
night
walked
up
and
stared
at
them
barbara
struggled
with
her
emotion
struggled
manfully
and
the
sobs
and
shrieks
subsided
not
the
excitement
or
the
passion
she
put
away
his
arm
and
stood
with
her
back
to
the
stile
leaning
against
it
carlyle
felt
inclined
to
fly
to
the
pond
for
water
but
he
had
nothing
but
his
hat
to
get
it
in
are
you
better
barbara
what
can
have
caused
it
what
can
have
caused
it
she
burst
forth
giving
full
swing
to
the
reins
and
forgetting
everything
you
can
ask
me
that
carlyle
was
struck
dumb
but
by
some
inexplicable
laws
of
sympathy
a
dim
and
very
unpleasant
consciousness
of
the
truth
began
to
steal
over
him
i
don
t
understand
you
barbara
if
i
have
offended
you
in
any
way
i
am
truly
truly
sorry
no
doubt
was
the
retort
the
sobs
and
the
shrieks
alarmingly
near
what
do
you
care
for
me
if
i
go
under
the
sod
morrow
stamping
it
with
her
foot
you
have
your
wife
to
care
for
what
am
i
hush
he
interposed
glancing
round
more
mindful
for
her
than
she
was
for
herself
hush
yes
you
would
like
me
to
hush
what
is
my
misery
to
you
i
would
rather
be
in
my
grave
archibald
carlyle
than
endure
the
life
i
have
led
since
you
married
her
my
pain
is
greater
than
i
well
know
how
to
i
can
not
affect
to
misunderstand
you
he
said
feeling
more
at
a
nonplus
than
he
had
felt
for
many
a
day
and
heartily
wishing
the
whole
female
creation
save
isabel
somewhere
but
my
dear
barbara
i
never
gave
you
cause
to
think
i
that
i
cared
for
you
more
than
i
never
gave
me
cause
she
gasped
when
you
have
been
coming
to
our
house
constantly
almost
like
my
shadow
when
you
gave
me
this
dashing
open
her
mantle
and
holding
up
the
locket
to
his
view
when
you
have
been
more
intimate
with
me
than
a
stay
barbara
there
it
is
a
brother
i
have
been
nothing
else
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
be
anything
else
he
added
in
his
straightforward
truth
ay
as
a
brother
nothing
else
and
her
voice
rose
once
more
with
her
excitement
it
seemed
that
she
would
not
long
control
it
what
cared
you
for
my
feelings
what
recked
you
that
you
gained
my
love
barbara
hush
he
implored
do
be
calm
and
reasonable
if
i
ever
gave
you
cause
to
think
i
regarded
you
with
deeper
feelings
i
can
only
express
to
you
my
deep
regret
my
repentance
and
assure
you
it
was
done
she
was
growing
calmer
the
passion
was
fading
leaving
her
face
still
and
white
she
lifted
it
toward
carlyle
you
treated
me
ill
in
showing
signs
of
love
if
you
felt
it
not
why
did
you
kiss
me
i
kissed
you
as
i
might
kiss
a
sister
or
perhaps
as
a
pretty
girl
man
likes
to
do
so
the
close
terms
on
which
our
families
have
lived
excused
if
it
did
not
justify
a
degree
of
familiarity
that
might
have
been
unseemly
in
you
need
not
tell
me
that
hotly
interrupted
barbara
had
it
been
a
stranger
who
had
won
my
love
and
then
thrown
me
from
him
do
you
suppose
i
would
have
reproached
him
as
i
am
now
reproaching
you
no
i
would
have
died
rather
than
that
he
should
have
suspected
it
if
she
had
not
come
between
us
should
you
have
loved
me
do
not
pursue
this
unthankful
topic
he
besought
almost
wishing
the
staring
cow
would
run
away
with
her
i
ask
you
should
you
have
loved
me
persisted
barbara
passing
her
handkerchief
over
her
ashy
lips
i
don
t
know
how
can
i
know
do
i
not
say
to
you
barbara
that
i
only
thought
of
you
as
a
friend
a
sister
i
can
not
tell
what
might
have
i
could
bear
it
better
but
that
it
was
known
she
murmured
all
west
lynne
had
coupled
us
together
in
their
prying
gossip
and
they
have
only
pity
to
cast
on
me
now
i
would
far
rather
you
have
killed
me
i
can
but
express
to
you
my
deep
regret
he
repeated
i
can
only
hope
you
will
soon
forget
it
all
let
the
remembrance
of
this
conversation
pass
away
with
let
us
still
be
to
each
other
as
friends
as
brother
and
sister
believe
me
he
concluded
in
a
deeper
tone
the
confession
has
not
lessened
you
in
my
he
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
get
over
the
stile
but
barbara
did
not
stir
the
tears
were
silently
coursing
down
her
pallid
face
at
that
moment
there
was
an
interruption
is
that
you
miss
barbara
barbara
started
as
if
she
had
been
shot
on
the
other
side
of
the
stile
stood
wilson
their
upper
maid
how
long
might
she
have
been
there
she
began
to
explain
that
hare
had
sent
jasper
out
and
hare
had
thought
it
better
to
wait
no
longer
for
the
man
s
return
so
had
dispatched
her
wilson
for
miss
barbara
carlyle
got
over
the
stile
and
handed
over
miss
barbara
you
need
not
come
any
further
now
she
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
i
should
see
you
home
was
his
reply
and
he
held
out
his
arm
barbara
took
it
they
walked
in
silence
arrived
at
the
back
gate
of
the
grove
which
gave
entrance
to
the
kitchen
garden
wilson
went
forward
carlyle
took
both
barbara
s
hands
in
his
barbara
god
bless
she
had
had
time
for
reflection
and
the
excitement
gone
she
saw
her
outbreak
in
all
its
shame
and
folly
carlyle
noticed
how
subdued
and
white
she
looked
i
think
i
have
been
mad
she
groaned
i
must
have
been
mad
to
say
what
i
did
forget
that
it
was
i
told
you
i
you
will
not
betray
me
to
to
your
wife
she
panted
barbara
thank
you
but
he
still
retained
her
hands
in
a
short
time
barbara
i
trust
you
will
find
one
more
worthy
to
receive
your
love
than
i
have
never
she
impulsively
answered
i
do
not
love
and
forget
so
lightly
in
the
years
to
come
in
my
old
age
i
shall
still
be
nothing
but
barbara
carlyle
walked
away
in
a
fit
of
musing
the
revelation
had
given
him
pain
and
possibly
a
little
bit
of
flattery
into
the
bargain
for
he
was
fond
of
pretty
barbara
fond
in
his
way
not
hers
not
with
the
sort
of
fondness
he
felt
for
his
wife
he
asked
his
conscience
whether
his
manner
to
her
in
the
past
days
had
been
a
tinge
warmer
than
we
bestow
upon
a
sister
and
he
decided
that
it
might
have
been
but
he
most
certainly
never
cast
a
suspicion
to
the
mischief
it
was
doing
i
heartily
hope
she
ll
soon
find
somebody
to
her
liking
and
forget
me
was
his
concluding
thought
as
to
living
and
dying
barbara
hare
that
s
all
moonshine
and
sentimental
rubbish
that
girls
like
to
archibald
he
was
passing
the
very
last
tree
in
the
park
the
nearest
to
his
house
and
the
interruption
came
from
a
dark
form
standing
under
it
is
it
you
my
dearest
i
came
out
to
meet
you
have
you
not
been
very
long
i
think
i
have
he
answered
as
he
drew
his
wife
to
his
side
and
walked
on
with
her
we
met
one
of
the
servants
at
the
second
stile
but
i
went
on
all
the
you
have
been
intimate
with
the
hares
quite
so
cornelia
is
related
to
do
you
think
barbara
pretty
then
intimate
as
you
were
i
wonder
you
never
fell
in
love
with
carlyle
laughed
a
very
conscious
laugh
considering
the
recent
interview
did
you
archibald
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
low
tone
almost
or
he
fancied
it
a
tone
of
emotion
and
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
did
i
what
isabel
you
never
loved
barbara
hare
loved
her
what
is
your
head
running
on
isabel
i
never
loved
but
one
and
that
one
i
made
my
own
my
cherished
chapter
xviii
miss
carlyle
isabel
unhappy
another
year
came
in
isabel
would
have
been
altogether
happy
but
for
miss
carlyle
that
lady
still
inflicted
her
presence
upon
east
lynne
and
made
it
the
bane
of
its
household
she
deferred
outwardly
to
lady
isabel
as
the
mistress
but
the
real
mistress
was
herself
isabel
was
little
more
than
an
automaton
her
impulses
were
checked
her
wishes
frustrated
her
actions
tacitly
condemned
by
the
miss
carlyle
poor
isabel
with
her
refined
manners
and
her
timid
and
sensitive
temperament
had
no
chance
against
the
woman
and
she
was
in
a
state
of
galling
subjection
in
her
own
house
not
a
day
passed
but
miss
carlyle
by
dint
of
hints
and
innuendoes
contrived
to
impress
upon
lady
isabel
the
unfortunate
blow
to
his
own
interests
that
carlyle
s
marriage
had
been
the
ruinous
expense
she
had
entailed
upon
the
family
it
struck
a
complete
chill
to
isabel
s
heart
and
she
became
painfully
impressed
with
the
incubus
she
must
be
to
carlyle
so
far
as
his
pocket
was
concerned
lord
mount
severn
with
his
little
son
had
paid
them
a
short
visit
at
christmas
and
isabel
had
asked
him
apparently
with
unconcern
whether
carlyle
had
put
himself
very
much
out
to
the
way
to
marry
her
whether
it
had
entailed
on
him
an
expense
and
a
style
of
living
he
would
not
otherwise
have
deemed
himself
justified
in
affording
lord
mount
severn
s
reply
was
an
unfortunate
one
his
opinion
was
that
it
had
he
said
and
that
isabel
ought
to
feel
grateful
to
him
for
his
generosity
she
sighed
as
she
listened
and
from
thenceforth
determined
to
put
up
with
miss
carlyle
more
timid
and
sensitive
by
nature
than
many
would
believe
or
can
imagine
reared
in
seclusion
more
simply
and
quietly
than
falls
to
the
general
lot
of
peers
daughters
completely
inexperienced
isabel
was
unfit
to
battle
with
the
world
totally
unfit
to
battle
with
miss
carlyle
the
penniless
state
in
which
she
was
left
at
her
father
s
death
the
want
of
a
home
save
that
accorded
her
at
castle
marling
even
the
note
left
in
her
hand
by
carlyle
all
had
imbued
her
with
a
deep
consciousness
of
humiliation
and
far
from
rebelling
at
or
despising
the
small
establishment
comparatively
speaking
provided
for
her
by
carlyle
she
felt
thankful
to
him
for
it
but
to
be
told
continuously
that
this
was
more
than
he
could
afford
that
she
was
in
fact
a
blight
upon
his
prospects
was
enough
to
turn
her
heart
to
bitterness
oh
that
she
had
had
the
courage
to
speak
out
openly
to
her
husband
that
he
might
by
a
single
word
of
earnest
love
and
assurance
have
taken
the
weight
from
her
heart
and
rejoiced
it
with
the
truth
that
all
these
miserable
complaints
were
but
the
phantoms
of
his
minded
sister
but
isabel
never
did
when
miss
corny
lapsed
into
her
grumbling
mood
she
would
hear
in
silence
or
gently
bend
her
aching
forehead
in
her
hands
never
retorting
never
before
carlyle
was
the
lady
s
temper
vented
upon
her
plenty
fell
to
his
own
share
when
he
and
his
sister
were
alone
and
he
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
sort
of
thing
all
his
life
had
got
used
to
it
like
the
eels
do
to
skinning
that
it
went
as
the
saying
runs
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
making
no
impression
he
never
dreamt
that
isabel
also
received
her
portion
it
was
a
morning
early
in
april
joyce
sat
in
its
gray
dawn
over
a
large
fire
in
the
of
lady
isabel
carlyle
her
hands
clasped
to
pain
and
the
tears
coursing
down
her
cheeks
joyce
was
frightened
she
had
had
some
experience
in
illness
but
illness
of
this
nature
she
had
never
witnessed
and
she
was
fervently
hoping
never
to
witness
it
again
in
the
adjoining
room
lay
lady
isabel
sick
nearly
unto
death
the
door
from
the
corridor
slowly
opened
and
miss
carlyle
slowly
entered
she
had
probably
never
walked
with
so
gentle
a
step
in
all
her
life
and
she
had
got
a
mantle
over
her
head
and
ears
down
she
sat
in
a
chair
quite
meekly
and
joyce
saw
that
her
face
looked
as
gray
as
the
early
dawn
joyce
whispered
she
is
there
any
danger
oh
ma
am
i
trust
not
but
it
s
hard
to
witness
and
it
must
be
awful
to
it
is
our
common
curse
joyce
you
and
i
may
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
have
not
chosen
to
encounter
it
joyce
she
added
after
a
pause
i
trust
there
s
no
danger
i
should
not
like
her
to
miss
carlyle
spoke
in
a
low
dread
tone
was
she
fearing
that
if
her
poor
young
did
die
a
weight
would
rest
on
her
own
conscience
for
all
time
a
heavy
weight
whispering
that
she
might
have
rendered
her
short
year
of
marriage
more
happy
had
she
chosen
and
that
she
had
not
so
chosen
but
had
deliberately
steeled
every
crevice
of
her
heart
against
her
very
probably
she
looked
anxious
and
apprehensive
in
the
morning
s
twilight
if
there
s
any
danger
joyce
why
do
you
think
there
s
danger
ma
am
interrupted
joyce
are
other
people
not
as
ill
as
this
it
is
to
be
hoped
they
are
not
rejoined
miss
carlyle
and
why
is
the
express
gone
to
lynneborough
for
martin
up
started
joyce
awe
struck
an
express
for
martin
oh
ma
am
who
sent
it
when
did
it
go
all
i
know
is
that
s
its
gone
wainwright
went
to
your
master
and
he
came
out
of
his
room
and
sent
john
galloping
to
the
telegraph
office
at
west
lynne
where
could
your
ears
have
been
not
to
hear
the
horse
tearing
off
i
heard
it
i
know
that
and
a
nice
fright
it
put
me
in
i
went
to
carlyle
s
room
to
ask
what
was
amiss
and
he
said
he
did
not
know
himself
nothing
he
hoped
and
then
he
shut
his
door
again
in
my
face
instead
of
stopping
to
speak
to
me
as
any
other
christian
joyce
did
not
answer
she
was
faint
with
apprehension
and
there
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
sounds
from
the
next
room
miss
carlyle
rose
and
a
fanciful
person
might
have
thought
she
was
shivering
i
can
t
stand
this
joyce
i
shall
go
if
they
want
coffee
or
anything
of
that
it
can
be
sent
here
i
will
presently
in
a
few
minutes
answered
joyce
with
a
real
shiver
you
are
not
going
in
are
you
ma
am
she
uttered
in
apprehension
as
miss
carlyle
began
to
steal
on
to
the
door
and
joyce
had
a
lively
consciousness
that
her
sight
would
not
be
an
agreeable
one
to
lady
isabel
they
want
the
room
free
they
sent
me
not
i
answered
miss
corny
i
could
do
no
good
and
those
who
can
not
are
better
just
what
wainwright
said
when
he
dismissed
me
murmured
joyce
and
miss
carlyle
finally
passed
into
the
corridor
and
withdrew
joyce
sat
on
it
seemed
to
her
an
interminable
time
and
then
she
heard
the
arrival
of
martin
heard
him
go
into
the
next
room
by
and
by
wainwright
came
out
of
it
into
the
room
where
joyce
was
sitting
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
and
before
she
could
bring
out
the
ominous
words
is
there
any
danger
he
had
passed
through
it
wainwright
was
on
his
way
to
the
apartment
where
he
expected
to
find
carlyle
the
latter
was
pacing
it
he
had
so
paced
it
all
the
night
his
pale
face
flushed
as
the
surgeon
entered
you
have
little
mercy
on
my
suspense
wainwright
martin
has
been
here
this
twenty
minutes
what
does
he
say
well
he
can
not
say
any
more
than
i
did
the
symptoms
are
critical
but
he
hopes
she
will
do
well
there
s
nothing
for
it
but
carlyle
resumed
his
weary
walk
i
come
now
to
suggest
that
you
should
send
for
little
in
these
protracted
cases
the
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
from
carlyle
half
horror
half
despair
for
the
rev
little
was
the
incumbent
of
jude
s
and
his
apprehensions
had
flown
he
hardly
knew
to
what
they
had
flown
not
for
your
wife
hastily
rejoined
the
surgeon
what
good
should
a
clergyman
do
to
her
i
spoke
on
the
score
of
the
child
should
it
not
live
it
may
be
satisfactory
to
you
and
lady
isabel
to
know
that
it
was
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
said
carlyle
grasping
his
hand
in
his
inexpressible
relief
little
shall
be
sent
you
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
your
wife
s
soul
was
flitting
please
god
she
may
yet
live
to
bear
you
other
children
if
this
one
does
please
god
was
the
inward
aspiration
of
carlyle
carlyle
added
the
surgeon
in
a
musing
sort
of
tone
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
carlyle
s
shoulder
which
his
own
head
scarcely
reached
i
am
sometimes
at
where
the
clergyman
is
sent
for
in
this
desperate
need
to
the
fleeting
spirit
and
i
am
tempted
to
ask
myself
what
good
another
man
priest
though
he
be
can
do
at
the
twelfth
hour
where
accounts
have
not
been
made
up
previously
it
was
hard
upon
midday
the
rev
little
carlyle
and
miss
carlyle
were
gathered
in
the
round
a
table
on
which
stood
a
rich
china
bowl
containing
water
for
the
baptism
joyce
her
pale
face
working
with
emotion
came
into
the
room
carrying
what
looked
like
a
bundle
of
flannel
little
cared
carlyle
for
the
bundle
in
comparison
with
his
care
for
his
wife
joyce
he
whispered
is
it
well
still
i
believe
so
the
services
commenced
the
clergyman
took
the
child
what
name
he
asked
carlyle
had
never
thought
about
the
name
but
he
replied
pretty
promptly
william
for
he
knew
it
was
a
name
revered
and
loved
by
lady
isabel
the
minister
dipped
his
fingers
in
the
water
joyce
interrupted
in
much
confusion
looking
at
her
master
it
is
a
little
girl
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
i
m
sure
i
thought
i
had
said
so
but
i
m
so
flurried
as
i
never
was
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
minister
spoke
again
name
the
isabel
lucy
said
carlyle
upon
which
a
strange
sort
of
resentful
sniff
was
heard
from
miss
corny
she
had
probably
thought
to
hear
him
mention
her
own
but
he
had
named
it
after
his
wife
and
his
mother
carlyle
was
not
allowed
to
see
his
wife
until
evening
his
eyelashes
glistened
as
he
looked
down
at
her
she
detected
his
emotion
and
a
faint
smile
parted
her
lips
i
fear
i
bore
it
badly
archibald
but
let
us
be
thankful
that
it
is
over
how
thankful
none
can
know
save
those
who
have
gone
through
i
think
they
can
he
murmured
i
never
knew
what
thankfulness
was
until
this
that
the
baby
is
safe
that
you
are
safe
my
darling
safe
and
spared
to
me
isabel
he
whispered
hiding
his
face
upon
hers
i
never
until
knew
what
prayer
was
the
prayer
of
a
heart
in
its
sore
have
you
written
to
lord
mount
severn
she
asked
after
a
while
this
afternoon
he
replied
why
did
you
give
baby
my
name
isabel
do
you
think
i
could
have
given
it
a
prettier
one
i
don
why
do
you
not
bring
a
chair
and
sit
down
by
me
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
i
wish
i
might
but
they
limited
my
stay
with
you
to
four
minutes
and
wainwright
has
posted
himself
outside
the
door
with
his
watch
in
his
quite
true
there
stood
the
careful
surgeon
and
the
short
interview
was
over
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
begun
the
baby
lived
and
appeared
likely
to
live
and
of
course
the
next
thing
was
to
look
out
for
a
maid
for
it
isabel
did
not
get
strong
very
quickly
fever
and
weakness
had
a
struggle
with
each
other
and
with
her
one
day
when
she
was
dressing
and
sitting
in
her
easy
chair
miss
carlyle
entered
of
all
the
servants
in
the
neighborhood
who
should
you
suppose
is
come
up
after
the
place
of
nurse
indeed
i
can
not
why
wilson
hare
s
maid
three
years
and
five
months
she
has
been
with
them
and
now
leaves
in
consequence
of
a
fall
out
with
barbara
will
you
see
her
is
she
likely
to
suit
is
she
a
good
servant
she
s
not
a
bad
servant
as
servants
go
responded
miss
carlyle
she
s
steady
and
respectable
but
she
has
got
a
tongue
as
long
as
from
here
to
that
won
t
hurt
baby
said
lady
isabel
but
if
she
has
lived
as
lady
s
maid
she
probably
does
not
understand
the
care
of
yes
she
does
she
was
upper
servant
at
squire
pinner
s
before
going
to
hare
s
five
years
she
lived
i
will
see
her
said
lady
isabel
miss
carlyle
left
the
room
to
send
the
servant
in
but
came
back
first
alone
mind
lady
isabel
don
t
you
engage
her
if
she
is
likely
to
suit
you
let
her
come
again
for
the
answer
and
meanwhile
i
will
go
down
to
hare
s
and
learn
the
ins
and
outs
of
her
leaving
it
is
all
very
plausible
for
her
to
put
upon
barbara
but
that
is
only
one
side
of
the
question
before
engaging
her
it
may
be
well
to
hear
the
of
course
this
was
but
right
isabel
acquiesced
and
the
servant
was
introduced
a
tall
woman
with
black
eyes
lady
isabel
inquired
why
she
was
leaving
hare
s
my
lady
it
is
through
miss
barbara
s
temper
latterly
oh
for
this
year
past
nothing
has
pleased
her
she
had
grown
nearly
as
imperious
as
the
justice
himself
i
have
threatened
many
times
to
leave
and
last
evening
we
came
to
another
outbreak
and
i
left
this
left
entirely
yes
my
lady
miss
barbara
provoked
me
so
that
i
said
last
night
i
would
leave
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
i
did
so
i
should
be
very
glad
to
take
your
situation
my
lady
if
you
would
please
to
try
you
have
been
the
upper
maid
at
hare
s
oh
yes
my
then
possibly
this
situation
might
not
suit
you
so
well
as
you
imagine
joyce
is
the
upper
servant
here
and
you
would
in
a
manner
be
under
her
i
have
great
confidence
in
joyce
and
in
case
of
my
illness
or
absence
joyce
would
superintend
the
i
should
not
mind
that
was
the
applicant
s
answer
we
all
like
joyce
my
a
few
more
questions
and
then
the
girl
was
told
to
come
again
in
the
evening
for
her
answer
miss
carlyle
went
to
the
grove
for
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
affair
where
hare
frankly
stated
that
she
had
nothing
to
urge
against
wilson
save
her
hasty
manner
of
leaving
and
believed
the
chief
blame
to
be
due
to
barbara
wilson
therefore
was
engaged
and
was
to
enter
upon
her
new
service
the
following
morning
in
the
afternoon
succeeding
to
it
isabel
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
her
bedroom
asleep
as
was
supposed
in
point
of
fact
she
was
in
that
state
half
asleep
half
wakeful
delirium
which
those
who
suffer
from
weakness
and
fever
know
only
too
well
suddenly
she
was
aroused
from
it
by
hearing
her
own
name
mentioned
in
the
adjoining
room
where
sat
joyce
and
wilson
the
latter
holding
the
sleeping
infant
on
her
knee
the
former
sewing
the
door
between
the
rooms
being
ajar
how
ill
she
does
look
observed
wilson
who
asked
joyce
her
ladyship
she
looks
just
as
if
she
d
never
get
over
she
is
getting
over
it
quickly
now
returned
joyce
if
you
had
seen
her
but
a
week
ago
you
would
not
say
she
was
looking
ill
now
speaking
in
my
goodness
would
not
somebody
s
hopes
be
up
again
if
anything
should
happen
nonsense
crossly
rejoined
joyce
you
may
cry
out
nonsense
forever
joyce
but
they
would
went
on
wilson
and
she
would
snap
him
up
to
a
dead
certainty
she
d
never
let
him
escape
her
a
second
time
she
is
as
much
in
love
with
him
as
she
ever
was
it
was
all
talk
and
fancy
said
joyce
west
lynne
must
be
busy
carlyle
never
cared
for
that
s
more
than
you
know
i
have
seen
a
little
joyce
i
have
seen
him
kiss
a
pack
of
rubbish
remarked
joyce
that
tells
i
don
t
say
it
does
there
s
not
a
young
man
living
but
what
s
fond
of
a
sly
kiss
in
the
dark
if
he
can
get
it
he
gave
her
that
locket
and
chain
she
who
wears
retorted
joyce
determined
not
graciously
to
countenance
the
subject
i
don
t
want
to
hear
anything
about
who
now
why
miss
barbara
she
has
hardly
had
it
off
her
neck
since
my
belief
is
she
wears
it
in
her
more
simpleton
she
returned
joyce
the
night
before
he
left
west
lynne
to
marry
lady
isabel
and
didn
t
the
news
come
upon
us
like
a
thunderclap
miss
barbara
had
been
at
miss
carlyle
s
and
he
brought
her
home
a
lovely
night
it
was
the
moon
rising
and
nearly
as
light
as
day
he
somehow
broke
her
parasol
in
coming
home
and
when
they
got
to
our
gate
there
was
a
love
were
you
a
third
in
it
sarcastically
demanded
joyce
yes
without
meaning
to
be
it
was
a
regular
love
scene
i
could
hear
enough
for
that
if
ever
anybody
thought
to
be
carlyle
barbara
did
that
why
you
great
baby
you
have
just
said
it
was
the
night
before
he
went
to
get
married
i
don
t
care
she
did
after
he
was
gone
i
saw
her
lift
up
her
hands
and
her
face
in
ecstacy
and
say
he
would
never
know
how
much
she
loved
him
until
she
was
his
wife
be
you
very
sure
joyce
many
a
had
passed
between
them
two
but
i
suppose
when
my
lady
was
thrown
in
his
way
he
couldn
t
resist
her
rank
and
her
beauty
and
the
old
love
was
cast
over
it
is
in
the
nature
of
man
to
be
fickle
specially
those
that
can
boast
of
their
own
good
looks
like
mr
carlyle
s
not
i
can
tell
you
more
yet
two
or
three
days
after
that
miss
corny
came
up
to
our
house
with
the
news
of
his
marriage
i
was
in
mistress
s
bedroom
and
they
were
in
the
room
underneath
the
windows
open
and
i
heard
miss
corny
tell
the
tale
for
i
was
leaning
out
up
came
miss
barbara
upon
an
excuse
and
flew
into
her
room
and
i
went
into
the
corridor
a
few
moments
and
i
heard
a
noise
it
was
a
sort
of
wail
or
groan
and
i
opened
the
door
softly
fearing
she
might
be
fainting
joyce
if
my
heart
never
ached
for
anybody
before
it
ached
then
she
was
lying
upon
the
floor
her
hands
writhed
together
and
her
poor
face
all
white
like
one
in
mortal
agony
i
d
have
given
a
quarter
s
wages
to
be
able
to
say
a
word
of
comfort
to
her
but
i
didn
t
dare
interfere
with
such
sorrow
as
that
i
came
out
again
and
shut
the
door
without
her
seeing
how
thoroughly
stupid
she
must
have
been
uttered
joyce
to
go
caring
for
one
who
did
not
care
for
i
tell
you
joyce
you
don
t
know
that
he
did
not
care
you
are
as
obstinate
as
the
justice
and
i
wish
to
goodness
you
wouldn
t
interrupt
me
they
came
up
here
to
pay
the
wedding
visit
master
mistress
and
she
came
in
state
in
the
grand
chariot
with
the
coachman
and
jasper
if
you
have
got
any
memory
at
all
you
can
t
fail
to
recollect
it
miss
barbara
remained
behind
at
east
lynne
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
i
remember
i
was
sent
to
fetch
her
home
in
the
evening
jasper
being
out
i
came
the
field
way
for
the
dust
by
the
road
was
enough
to
smother
one
and
by
the
last
stile
but
one
what
do
you
think
i
came
upon
joyce
lifted
her
eyes
a
snake
i
came
upon
miss
barbara
and
carlyle
what
had
passed
nobody
knows
but
themselves
she
was
leaning
back
against
the
stile
crying
low
soft
sobs
breaking
from
her
like
one
might
expect
to
hear
from
a
breaking
heart
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
reproaching
him
as
if
some
explanation
had
passed
and
i
heard
him
say
that
from
henceforth
they
could
only
be
brother
and
sister
i
spoke
soon
for
fear
they
should
see
me
and
carlyle
got
over
the
stile
miss
barbara
said
to
him
that
he
need
not
come
any
further
but
he
held
out
his
arm
and
came
with
her
to
our
back
gate
i
went
on
then
to
open
the
door
and
i
saw
him
with
his
head
bent
down
to
her
and
her
two
hands
held
in
his
we
don
t
know
how
it
is
between
them
i
tell
at
any
rate
she
is
a
downright
fool
to
suffer
herself
to
love
him
still
uttered
joyce
indignantly
so
she
is
but
she
does
do
it
she
ll
often
steal
out
to
the
gate
about
the
time
she
knows
he
ll
be
passing
and
watch
him
by
not
letting
him
see
her
it
is
nothing
but
her
unhappiness
her
jealousy
of
lady
isabel
that
makes
her
cross
i
assure
you
joyce
in
this
past
year
she
had
so
changed
that
she
s
not
like
the
same
person
if
carlyle
should
ever
get
tired
of
my
lady
and
wilson
harshly
interrupted
joyce
have
the
goodness
to
recollect
what
have
i
said
now
nothing
but
truth
men
are
shamefully
fickle
husbands
worse
than
sweethearts
and
i
m
sure
i
m
not
thinking
of
anything
wrong
but
to
go
back
to
the
argument
that
we
began
with
i
say
that
if
anything
happened
to
my
lady
miss
barbara
as
sure
as
fate
would
step
into
her
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
her
continued
joyce
with
composure
i
hope
it
is
not
now
or
later
for
the
sake
of
this
dear
little
innocent
thing
upon
my
lap
went
on
the
undaunted
wilson
she
would
not
make
a
very
kind
stepmother
for
it
is
certain
that
where
the
first
wife
had
been
hated
her
children
won
t
be
loved
she
would
turn
carlyle
against
them
i
tell
you
what
it
is
wilson
interrupted
joyce
in
a
firm
unmistakable
tone
if
you
think
to
pursue
those
sort
of
topics
at
east
lynne
i
shall
inform
my
lady
that
you
are
unsuitable
for
the
i
dare
say
and
you
know
that
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
do
it
continued
joyce
miss
carlyle
may
well
say
you
have
the
longest
tongue
in
west
lynne
but
you
might
have
the
grace
to
know
that
this
subject
is
one
more
unsuitable
to
it
than
another
whether
you
are
eating
hare
s
bread
or
whether
you
are
eating
carlyle
s
another
word
wilson
it
appears
to
me
that
you
have
been
carrying
on
a
prying
system
in
hare
s
house
do
not
attempt
such
a
thing
in
you
were
always
one
of
the
sort
joyce
cried
wilson
laughing
but
now
that
i
have
had
my
say
out
i
shall
stop
and
you
need
not
fear
i
shall
be
such
a
simpleton
as
to
go
prattling
of
this
kind
of
thing
to
the
now
just
fancy
this
conversation
penetrating
to
lady
isabel
she
heard
every
word
it
is
all
very
well
to
oppose
the
argument
who
attends
to
the
gossip
of
the
servants
let
me
tell
you
it
depends
upon
what
the
subject
may
be
whether
the
gossip
is
attended
to
or
not
it
might
not
and
indeed
would
not
have
made
so
great
an
impression
upon
her
had
she
been
in
strong
health
but
she
was
weak
feverish
and
in
a
state
of
partial
delirium
and
she
hastily
took
up
the
idea
that
archibald
carlyle
had
never
loved
her
that
he
had
admired
her
and
made
her
his
wife
in
his
ambition
but
that
his
heart
had
been
given
to
barbara
hare
a
pretty
state
of
excitement
she
worked
herself
into
as
she
lay
there
jealousy
and
fever
ay
and
love
too
playing
pranks
with
her
brain
it
was
near
the
dinner
hour
and
when
carlyle
entered
he
was
startled
to
see
her
her
pallid
cheeks
were
burning
with
a
red
hectic
glow
and
her
eyes
glistened
with
fever
isabel
you
are
worse
he
uttered
as
he
approached
her
with
a
quick
step
she
partially
rose
from
the
sofa
and
clasped
hold
of
him
in
her
emotion
oh
archibald
archibald
she
uttered
don
t
marry
her
i
could
not
rest
in
my
carlyle
in
his
puzzled
astonishment
believed
her
to
be
laboring
under
some
temporary
hallucination
the
result
of
weakness
he
set
himself
to
soothe
her
but
it
seemed
that
she
could
not
be
soothed
she
burst
into
a
storm
of
tears
and
began
again
wild
words
she
would
my
child
she
would
draw
your
love
from
it
and
from
my
memory
archibald
you
must
not
marry
her
you
must
be
speaking
from
the
influence
of
a
dream
isabel
he
soothingly
said
you
have
been
asleep
and
are
not
yet
awake
be
still
and
recollection
will
return
to
you
there
love
rest
upon
to
think
of
her
as
your
wife
brings
pain
enough
to
kill
me
she
continued
to
reiterate
promise
me
that
you
will
not
marry
her
archibald
promise
it
i
will
promise
you
anything
in
reason
he
replied
bewildered
with
her
words
but
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
there
is
no
possibility
of
my
marrying
any
one
isabel
you
are
my
but
if
i
die
i
may
you
know
i
may
and
many
think
i
shall
do
not
let
her
usurp
my
indeed
she
shall
not
whoever
you
may
be
talking
of
what
have
you
been
dreaming
who
is
it
that
has
been
troubling
your
mind
archibald
do
you
need
to
ask
did
you
love
no
one
before
you
married
me
perhaps
you
have
loved
her
since
perhaps
you
love
her
still
carlyle
began
to
discern
method
in
her
he
changed
his
cheering
tone
to
one
of
grave
earnestness
of
whom
to
you
speak
isabel
of
barbara
he
knitted
his
brow
he
was
both
annoyed
and
vexed
whatever
had
put
this
bygone
nonsense
into
his
wife
s
head
he
quitted
the
sofa
where
he
had
been
supporting
her
and
stood
upright
before
her
calm
dignified
almost
solemn
in
his
seriousness
isabel
what
notion
can
you
possibly
have
picked
up
about
myself
and
barbara
hare
i
never
entertained
the
faintest
shadow
of
love
for
her
either
before
my
marriage
or
since
you
must
tell
me
what
has
given
rise
to
this
idea
in
your
but
she
loved
a
moment
s
hesitation
for
of
course
carlyle
was
conscious
that
she
had
but
taking
all
the
circumstances
into
consideration
more
especially
how
he
learnt
the
fact
he
could
not
in
honor
acknowledge
it
to
his
wife
if
it
was
so
isabel
she
was
more
reprehensibly
foolish
than
i
should
have
given
barbara
s
good
sense
could
be
for
a
woman
may
almost
as
well
lose
herself
as
to
suffer
herself
to
love
unsought
if
she
did
give
her
love
to
me
i
can
only
say
i
was
entirely
unconscious
of
it
believe
me
you
have
as
much
cause
to
be
jealous
of
cornelia
as
you
have
of
barbara
an
impulse
rose
within
her
that
she
would
tell
him
all
the
few
words
dropped
by
susan
and
joyce
twelve
months
before
the
conversation
she
had
just
overheard
but
in
that
moment
of
renewed
confidence
it
did
appear
to
her
that
she
must
have
been
very
foolish
to
attach
importance
to
it
that
a
sort
of
humiliation
in
listening
to
the
converse
of
servants
was
reflected
on
her
and
she
remained
silent
there
never
was
a
passion
in
this
world
there
never
will
be
one
so
fantastic
so
delusive
so
powerful
as
jealousy
carlyle
dismissed
the
episode
from
his
thoughts
he
believed
his
wife
s
emotion
to
have
been
simply
from
a
feverish
dream
and
never
supposed
but
that
with
the
dream
its
recollection
would
pass
away
from
her
not
so
implicitly
relying
upon
her
husband
s
words
at
the
moment
feeling
quite
ashamed
at
her
own
suspicion
lady
isabel
afterward
suffered
the
unhappy
fear
to
regain
its
influence
the
revelations
of
wilson
reasserted
their
power
overmastering
the
denial
of
carlyle
shakspeare
calls
jealousy
yellow
and
green
i
think
it
may
be
called
black
and
white
for
it
most
assuredly
views
white
as
black
and
black
as
white
the
most
fanciful
surmises
wear
the
aspect
of
truth
the
greatest
improbabilities
appear
as
consistent
realities
not
another
word
said
isabel
to
her
husband
and
the
feeling
you
will
understand
this
if
you
have
ever
been
foolish
enough
to
sun
yourself
in
its
delights
only
caused
her
to
grow
more
attached
to
him
to
be
more
eager
for
his
love
but
certain
it
is
that
barbara
hare
dwelt
on
her
heart
like
an
incubus
chapter
xix
captain
thorn
at
west
lynne
barbara
how
fine
the
day
seems
it
is
a
beautiful
day
i
do
think
i
should
be
all
the
better
for
going
i
am
sure
you
would
mamma
was
barbara
s
answer
if
you
went
out
more
you
would
find
the
benefit
every
fine
day
you
ought
to
do
so
i
will
go
and
ask
papa
if
he
can
spare
benjamin
and
the
she
waltzed
gaily
out
of
the
room
but
returned
in
a
moment
mamma
it
is
all
right
benjamin
is
gone
to
get
the
carriage
ready
you
would
like
a
bit
of
luncheon
before
you
go
i
will
order
the
anything
you
please
dear
said
the
gentlewoman
i
don
t
know
why
but
i
feel
glad
to
go
out
perhaps
because
it
is
benjamin
made
ready
his
carriage
and
himself
and
drove
out
of
the
yard
at
the
back
and
brought
the
carriage
round
to
the
front
gate
the
carriage
or
phaeton
as
it
was
often
called
was
a
somewhat
old
fashioned
concern
as
many
country
things
are
apt
to
be
a
small
box
in
front
for
the
driver
and
a
wide
seat
with
a
head
behind
accommodating
barbara
well
between
them
when
and
hare
both
sat
in
benjamin
drew
the
rug
carefully
over
his
mistress
s
knees
the
servants
did
not
like
hare
but
would
have
laid
down
their
lives
for
her
ascended
to
his
box
and
drove
them
to
their
destination
the
linen
draper
s
it
was
an
excellent
shop
situated
a
little
beyond
the
office
of
carlyle
and
hare
and
barbara
were
soon
engaged
in
that
occupation
said
to
possess
for
all
women
a
fascination
they
had
been
in
about
an
hour
when
hare
discovered
that
her
bag
was
missing
i
must
have
left
it
in
the
carriage
barbara
go
and
bring
it
will
you
my
dear
the
pattern
of
that
silk
is
in
barbara
went
out
the
carriage
and
benjamin
and
the
sleek
old
horse
were
all
waiting
drowsily
together
barbara
could
not
see
the
bag
and
she
appealed
to
the
servant
find
mamma
s
bag
benjamin
it
must
be
somewhere
in
the
benjamin
got
off
his
box
and
began
to
search
barbara
waited
gazing
listlessly
down
the
street
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
and
its
rays
fell
upon
the
large
cable
chain
of
a
gentleman
who
was
sauntering
idly
up
the
pavement
making
its
gold
links
and
its
drooping
seal
and
key
glitter
as
they
crossed
his
waistcoat
it
shone
also
upon
the
enameled
gold
studs
of
his
shirt
front
making
them
glitter
and
as
he
suddenly
raised
his
ungloved
hand
to
stroke
his
moustache
by
which
action
you
know
a
vain
man
a
diamond
ring
he
wore
gleamed
with
a
light
that
was
positively
dazzling
involuntarily
barbara
thought
of
the
description
her
brother
richard
had
given
of
certain
dazzling
jewels
worn
by
another
she
watched
him
advance
he
was
a
handsome
man
of
perhaps
seven
or
eight
and
twenty
tall
slender
and
well
made
his
eyes
and
hair
black
a
very
pleasant
expression
sat
upon
his
countenance
and
on
the
left
hand
he
wore
a
light
buff
kid
glove
and
was
swinging
its
fellow
by
the
fingers
but
for
the
light
cast
at
that
moment
by
the
sun
barbara
might
not
have
noticed
the
jewellery
or
connected
it
in
her
mind
with
the
other
jewellery
in
that
unhappy
secret
hallo
thorn
is
that
you
just
step
over
the
speaker
was
otway
bethel
who
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
spoken
to
the
gentleman
with
the
jewellery
but
the
latter
was
in
a
brown
study
and
did
not
hear
bethel
called
out
again
louder
captain
thorn
that
was
heard
captain
thorn
nodded
and
turned
short
off
across
the
street
barbara
stood
like
one
in
a
dream
her
brain
her
mind
her
fancy
all
in
a
confused
mass
together
here
s
the
bag
miss
barbara
it
had
got
among
the
folds
of
the
benjamin
held
it
out
to
her
but
she
took
no
notice
she
was
unconscious
of
all
external
things
save
one
that
she
beheld
the
real
murderer
of
hallijohn
she
entertained
no
manner
of
doubt
in
every
particular
he
tallied
with
the
description
given
by
richard
tall
dark
vain
handsome
delicate
hands
jewellery
and
captain
thorn
barbara
s
cheeks
grew
white
and
her
heart
turned
sick
the
bag
miss
away
tore
barbara
leaving
benjamin
and
the
bag
in
wonder
she
had
caught
sight
of
wainwright
the
surgeon
at
a
little
distance
and
sped
toward
him
mr
wainwright
began
she
forgetting
ceremony
in
her
agitation
you
see
that
gentleman
talking
to
otway
bethel
who
is
he
wainwright
had
to
put
his
glasses
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
before
he
could
answer
for
he
was
that
oh
it
is
a
captain
thorn
he
is
visiting
the
herberts
i
where
does
he
come
from
where
does
he
live
reiterated
barbara
in
her
eagerness
i
don
t
know
anything
about
him
i
saw
him
this
morning
with
young
smith
and
he
told
me
he
was
a
friend
of
the
herberts
you
are
not
looking
well
miss
she
made
no
answer
captain
thorn
and
bethel
came
walking
down
the
street
and
the
latter
saluted
her
but
she
was
too
much
confused
to
respond
to
it
wainwright
then
wished
her
good
day
and
barbara
walked
slowly
back
hare
was
appearing
at
the
shop
door
my
dear
how
long
you
are
can
not
the
bag
be
found
i
went
to
speak
to
wainwright
answered
barbara
mechanically
taking
the
bag
from
benjamin
and
giving
it
to
her
mother
her
whole
heart
and
eyes
still
absorbed
with
that
one
object
moving
away
in
the
distance
you
look
pale
child
are
you
well
oh
yes
quite
let
us
get
our
shopping
over
she
moved
on
to
their
places
at
the
counter
as
she
spoke
eager
to
get
it
over
and
be
at
home
that
she
might
have
time
for
thought
hare
wondered
what
had
come
to
her
the
pleased
interest
displayed
in
their
purchases
previously
was
now
gone
and
she
sat
inattentive
and
absorbed
now
my
dear
it
is
only
waiting
for
you
to
choose
which
of
the
two
silks
will
you
have
either
any
take
which
you
like
barbara
what
has
come
to
you
i
believe
i
am
tired
said
barbara
with
a
forced
laugh
as
she
compelled
herself
to
pay
some
sort
of
attention
i
don
t
like
the
green
i
will
take
the
they
arrived
at
home
barbara
got
just
five
minutes
alone
in
her
chamber
before
the
dinner
was
on
the
table
all
the
conclusion
she
could
come
to
was
she
could
do
nothing
save
tell
the
facts
to
archibald
carlyle
how
could
she
contrive
to
see
him
the
business
might
admit
of
no
delay
she
supposed
she
must
go
to
east
lynne
that
evening
but
where
would
be
her
excuse
for
it
at
home
puzzling
over
it
she
went
down
to
dinner
during
the
meal
hare
began
talking
of
some
silk
she
had
purchased
for
a
mantle
she
should
have
it
made
like
miss
carlyle
s
new
one
when
miss
carlyle
was
at
the
grove
the
other
day
about
wilson
s
character
she
offered
her
the
pattern
and
she
hare
would
send
one
of
the
servants
up
for
it
after
dinner
oh
mamma
let
me
go
burst
forth
barbara
and
so
vehemently
spoke
she
that
the
justice
paused
in
carving
and
demanded
what
ailed
her
barbara
made
some
timid
excuse
her
eagerness
is
natural
richard
smiled
hare
barbara
thinks
she
shall
get
a
peep
at
the
baby
i
expect
all
young
folks
are
fond
of
barbara
s
face
flushed
crimson
but
she
did
not
contradict
the
opinion
she
could
not
eat
her
dinner
she
was
too
full
of
poor
richard
she
played
with
it
and
then
sent
away
her
plate
nearly
untouched
that
s
through
the
finery
she
s
been
buying
pronounced
justice
hare
her
head
is
stuffed
up
with
no
opposition
was
offered
to
barbara
s
going
to
east
lynne
she
reached
it
just
as
their
dinner
was
over
it
was
for
miss
carlyle
she
asked
miss
carlyle
is
not
at
home
miss
she
is
spending
the
day
out
and
my
lady
does
not
receive
visitors
it
was
a
sort
of
checkmate
barbara
was
compelled
to
say
she
would
see
carlyle
peter
ushered
her
into
the
and
carlyle
came
to
her
i
am
so
very
sorry
to
disturb
you
to
have
asked
for
you
began
barbara
with
a
burning
face
for
somehow
a
certain
evening
interview
of
hers
with
him
twelve
months
before
was
disagreeably
present
to
her
never
since
that
evening
of
agitation
had
barbara
suffered
herself
to
betray
emotion
to
carlyle
her
manner
to
him
had
been
calm
courteous
and
indifferent
and
she
now
more
frequently
called
him
mr
carlyle
than
take
a
seat
take
a
seat
i
asked
for
miss
carlyle
she
continued
for
mamma
is
in
want
of
a
pattern
that
she
promised
to
lend
her
you
remember
the
lieutenant
thorn
whom
richard
spoke
of
as
being
the
real
criminal
i
think
he
is
at
west
carlyle
was
aroused
to
eager
interest
he
the
same
thorn
it
can
be
no
other
mamma
and
i
were
shopping
and
i
went
out
for
her
bag
which
she
left
in
the
carriage
while
benjamin
was
getting
it
i
saw
a
stranger
coming
up
the
street
a
tall
haired
man
with
a
conspicuous
gold
chain
and
studs
the
sun
was
full
upon
him
causing
the
ornaments
to
shine
especially
a
diamond
ring
which
he
wore
for
he
had
one
hand
raised
to
his
face
the
thought
flashed
over
me
that
is
just
like
the
description
richard
gave
of
the
man
why
the
idea
should
have
occurred
to
me
in
that
strange
manner
i
do
not
know
but
it
most
assuredly
did
occur
though
i
did
not
really
suppose
him
to
be
the
same
just
then
i
heard
him
spoken
to
by
some
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
it
was
otway
bethel
and
he
called
him
captain
this
is
curious
indeed
barbara
i
did
not
know
any
stranger
was
at
west
i
saw
wainwright
and
asked
him
who
it
was
he
said
a
captain
thorn
a
friend
of
the
herberts
a
lieutenant
thorn
four
or
five
years
ago
would
probably
be
captain
thorn
carlyle
nodded
and
there
was
a
pause
what
can
be
done
asked
barbara
carlyle
was
passing
one
hand
over
his
brow
it
was
a
habit
of
his
when
in
deep
thought
it
is
hard
to
say
what
is
to
be
done
barbara
the
description
you
gave
of
this
man
certainly
tallies
with
that
given
by
richard
did
he
look
like
a
gentleman
very
much
so
a
remarkably
aristocratic
looking
man
as
it
struck
carlyle
again
nodded
assentingly
he
remembered
richard
s
words
when
describing
the
other
an
of
course
barbara
the
first
thing
must
be
to
try
and
ascertain
whether
it
is
the
same
he
observed
if
we
find
it
is
then
we
must
deliberate
upon
future
measures
i
will
see
what
i
can
pick
up
and
let
you
barbara
rose
carlyle
escorted
her
across
the
hall
and
then
strolled
down
the
park
by
her
side
deep
in
the
subject
and
quite
unconscious
that
lady
isabel
s
jealous
eyes
were
watching
them
from
her
window
you
say
he
seemed
intimate
with
otway
bethel
as
to
being
intimate
i
can
not
say
otway
bethel
spoke
as
though
he
knew
this
must
have
caused
excitement
to
you
forget
archibald
that
mamma
was
not
told
anything
about
thorn
was
the
answer
of
barbara
the
uncertainty
would
have
worried
her
to
death
all
richard
said
to
her
was
that
he
was
innocent
that
it
was
a
stranger
who
did
the
deed
and
she
asked
for
no
particulars
she
had
implicit
faith
in
richard
s
true
i
did
forget
replied
carlyle
i
wish
we
could
find
out
some
one
who
knew
the
other
thorn
to
ascertain
that
they
were
the
same
would
be
a
great
point
he
went
as
far
as
the
park
gates
with
barbara
shook
hands
and
wished
her
good
evening
scarcely
had
she
departed
when
carlyle
saw
two
gentlemen
advancing
from
the
opposite
direction
in
one
of
whom
he
recognized
tom
herbert
and
the
other
instinct
told
him
was
captain
thorn
he
waited
till
they
came
up
if
this
isn
t
lucky
seeing
you
cried
tom
herbert
who
was
a
sort
of
a
gentleman
the
second
son
of
a
brother
justice
of
hare
i
wish
to
goodness
you
d
give
us
a
draught
of
your
cider
carlyle
we
went
up
to
beauchamp
s
for
a
stroll
but
found
them
all
out
and
i
m
awful
thirsty
captain
thorn
carlyle
invited
them
to
his
house
and
ordered
in
refreshments
young
herbert
coolly
threw
himself
into
an
and
lit
a
cigar
come
thorn
cried
he
here
s
a
weed
for
captain
thorn
glanced
toward
carlyle
he
appeared
of
a
far
more
gentlemanly
nature
than
tom
herbert
you
ll
have
one
too
carlyle
said
herbert
holding
out
his
case
oh
i
forgot
you
are
a
muff
don
t
smoke
one
twice
a
year
i
say
how
s
lady
isabel
very
ill
by
jove
is
she
though
tell
her
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
will
you
carlyle
but
i
say
will
she
smell
the
smoke
asked
he
with
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
concern
in
his
face
carlyle
reassured
him
upon
the
point
and
turned
to
captain
thorn
are
you
acquainted
with
this
neighborhood
captain
thorn
smiled
i
only
reached
west
lynne
you
were
never
here
before
then
continued
carlyle
setting
down
the
last
as
a
probably
evasive
answer
he
and
my
brother
jack
you
know
are
in
the
same
regiment
put
in
tom
with
scanty
ceremony
jack
had
invited
him
down
for
some
fishing
and
that
and
thorn
arrives
but
he
never
sent
word
he
was
coming
you
see
jack
had
given
him
up
and
is
off
on
some
irish
expedition
the
deuce
knows
where
precious
unlucky
that
it
should
have
happened
so
thorn
says
he
shall
cut
short
his
stay
and
go
the
conversation
turned
upon
fishing
and
in
the
heat
of
the
argument
the
stranger
mentioned
a
certain
pond
and
its
famous
eels
the
low
carlyle
looked
at
him
speaking
however
in
a
careless
manner
which
do
you
mean
we
have
two
ponds
not
far
apart
each
called
the
low
pond
i
mean
the
one
on
an
estate
about
three
miles
from
here
squire
thorpe
s
unless
i
am
carlyle
smiled
i
think
you
must
have
been
in
the
neighborhood
before
captain
thorn
squire
thorpe
is
dead
and
the
property
has
passed
to
his
daughter
s
husband
and
that
low
pond
was
filled
up
three
years
i
have
heard
a
friend
mention
it
was
captain
thorn
s
reply
spoken
in
an
indifferent
tone
though
he
evidently
wished
not
to
pursue
the
subject
carlyle
by
easy
degrees
turned
the
conversation
upon
swainson
the
place
where
richard
hare
s
captain
thorn
was
suspected
to
have
come
the
present
captain
thorn
said
he
knew
it
a
little
he
had
once
been
staying
there
a
short
carlyle
became
nearly
convinced
that
barbara
s
suspicions
were
correct
the
description
certainly
agreed
so
far
as
he
could
judge
in
the
most
minute
particulars
the
man
before
him
wore
two
rings
a
diamond
and
a
very
beautiful
diamond
too
on
the
one
hand
a
seal
ring
on
the
other
his
hands
were
delicate
to
a
degree
and
his
handkerchief
a
cambric
one
of
unusually
fine
texture
was
not
entirely
guiltless
of
scent
carlyle
quitted
the
room
for
a
moment
and
summoned
joyce
to
him
my
lady
has
been
asking
for
you
said
joyce
tell
her
i
will
be
up
the
moment
these
gentlemen
leave
joyce
he
added
find
an
excuse
to
come
into
the
room
presently
you
can
bring
something
or
other
in
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
stranger
who
is
with
young
herbert
notice
him
well
i
fancy
you
may
have
seen
him
carlyle
returned
to
the
room
leaving
joyce
surprised
however
she
presently
followed
taking
in
some
water
and
lingered
a
few
minutes
apparently
placing
the
things
on
the
table
in
better
order
when
the
two
departed
carlyle
called
joyce
before
proceeding
to
his
wife
s
room
well
he
questioned
did
you
recognize
him
not
at
all
sir
he
seemed
quite
strange
to
cast
your
thoughts
back
joyce
did
you
never
see
him
in
days
gone
by
joyce
looked
puzzled
and
she
replied
in
the
negative
is
he
the
man
think
you
who
used
to
ride
from
swainson
to
see
afy
joyce
s
face
flushed
crimson
oh
sir
was
all
she
uttered
the
name
is
the
same
thorn
i
thought
it
possible
the
men
might
be
observed
carlyle
sir
i
can
not
say
i
never
saw
that
captain
thorn
but
once
and
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
joyce
spoke
slowly
and
with
consideration
that
i
should
at
all
know
him
again
i
did
not
think
of
him
when
i
looked
at
this
gentleman
but
at
any
rate
no
appearance
in
this
one
struck
upon
my
memory
as
being
so
from
joyce
carlyle
obtained
no
clue
one
way
or
the
other
the
following
day
he
sought
out
otway
bethel
are
you
intimate
with
that
captain
thorn
who
is
staying
with
the
herberts
asked
he
yes
answered
bethel
decisively
if
passing
a
couple
of
hours
in
his
company
can
constitute
intimacy
that
s
all
i
have
seen
of
are
you
sure
pursued
carlyle
sure
returned
bethel
why
what
are
you
driving
at
now
i
called
in
at
herbert
s
the
night
before
last
and
tom
asked
me
to
stay
the
evening
thorn
had
just
come
a
jolly
bout
we
had
cigars
and
cold
bethel
said
carlyle
dashing
to
the
point
is
it
the
thorn
who
used
to
go
after
afy
hallijohn
come
you
can
tell
if
you
bethel
remained
dumb
for
a
moment
apparently
with
amazement
what
a
confounded
lie
uttered
he
at
length
why
it
s
no
more
that
than
what
thorn
he
broke
off
abruptly
you
are
equivocating
bethel
the
thorn
who
is
mixed
up
or
said
to
the
hallijohn
affair
is
this
the
same
man
you
are
a
fool
carlyle
which
is
what
i
never
took
you
to
be
yet
was
bethel
s
rejoinder
spoken
in
a
savage
tone
i
have
told
you
that
i
never
knew
there
was
any
thorn
mixed
up
with
afy
and
i
should
like
to
know
why
my
word
is
not
to
be
believed
i
never
saw
thorn
in
my
life
till
i
saw
him
the
other
night
at
the
herberts
and
that
i
would
take
my
oath
to
if
put
to
bethel
quitted
carlyle
with
the
last
word
and
the
latter
gazed
after
him
revolving
points
in
his
brain
the
mention
of
thorn
s
name
the
one
spoken
of
by
richard
hare
appeared
to
excite
some
feeling
in
bethel
s
mind
arousing
it
to
irritation
carlyle
remembered
that
it
had
done
so
previously
and
now
it
had
done
so
again
and
yet
bethel
was
an
man
in
general
far
better
tempered
than
principled
that
there
was
something
hidden
some
mystery
connected
with
the
affair
carlyle
felt
sure
but
he
could
not
attempt
so
much
as
a
guess
at
what
it
might
be
and
this
interview
with
bethel
brought
him
no
nearer
the
point
he
wished
to
find
out
whether
this
thorn
was
the
same
man
in
walking
back
to
his
office
he
met
tom
herbert
does
captain
thorn
purpose
making
a
long
stay
with
you
he
stopped
him
to
inquire
he
s
gone
i
have
just
seen
him
off
by
the
train
was
the
reply
of
tom
herbert
it
seemed
rather
slow
with
him
without
jack
so
he
docked
his
visit
and
says
he
ll
pay
us
one
when
jack
s
to
the
as
carlyle
went
home
to
dinner
that
evening
he
entered
the
grove
ostensibly
to
make
a
short
call
on
hare
barbara
on
the
tenterhooks
of
impatience
accompanied
him
outside
when
he
departed
and
walked
down
the
path
what
have
you
learnt
she
eagerly
asked
nothing
satisfactory
was
the
reply
of
carlyle
and
the
man
has
left
left
uttered
barbara
carlyle
explained
he
told
her
how
they
had
come
to
his
house
the
previous
evening
after
barbara
s
departure
and
his
encounter
with
tom
herbert
that
day
he
mentioned
also
his
interview
with
bethel
can
he
have
gone
on
purpose
fearing
consequences
wondered
barbara
scarcely
or
why
should
he
have
come
you
did
not
suffer
any
word
to
escape
you
last
night
causing
him
to
suspect
for
a
moment
that
he
was
hounded
not
any
you
would
make
a
bad
lawyer
who
or
what
is
he
an
officer
in
her
majesty
s
service
in
john
herbert
s
regiment
i
ascertained
no
more
tom
said
he
was
of
good
family
but
i
can
not
help
suspecting
it
is
the
same
can
nothing
more
be
done
nothing
in
the
present
stage
of
the
affair
continued
carlyle
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
to
continue
his
way
we
can
only
wait
on
again
with
what
patience
we
may
hoping
that
time
will
bring
about
its
own
barbara
pressed
her
forehead
down
on
the
cold
iron
of
the
gate
as
his
footsteps
died
away
aye
to
wait
on
she
murmured
to
wait
on
in
dreary
pain
to
wait
on
perhaps
for
years
perhaps
forever
and
poor
richard

out
his
days

exile
chapter
xx
going
from
home
i
should
recommend
a
complete
change
of
scene
altogether
carlyle
say
some
place
on
the
french
or
belgian
coast
sea
bathing
might
do
should
you
think
it
well
for
her
to
go
so
far
from
home
i
should
in
these
cases
of
protracted
weakness
where
you
can
do
nothing
but
try
to
coax
the
strength
back
again
change
of
air
and
scene
are
of
immense
i
will
propose
it
to
her
said
carlyle
i
have
just
done
so
replied
martin
who
was
the
other
speaker
she
met
it
with
objection
which
i
expected
for
invalids
naturally
feel
a
disinclination
to
move
from
home
but
it
is
necessary
that
she
should
the
object
of
their
conversation
was
lady
isabel
years
had
gone
on
and
there
were
three
children
now
at
east
lynne
isabel
william
and
archibald
the
latter
twelve
months
old
lady
isabel
had
a
month
or
two
back
been
attacked
with
illness
she
recovered
from
the
disorder
but
it
had
left
her
in
an
alarming
state
of
weakness
she
seemed
to
get
worse
instead
of
better
and
martin
was
summoned
from
lynneborough
the
best
thing
he
could
recommend
as
you
have
seen
was
change
of
air
lady
isabel
was
unwilling
to
take
the
advice
more
especially
to
go
so
far
as
the
french
and
but
for
a
circumstance
that
seemed
to
have
happened
purposely
to
induce
her
to
decide
would
probably
never
have
gone
ducie
the
reader
may
not
have
forgotten
her
name
had
in
conjunction
with
her
husband
the
honorable
augustus
somewhat
run
out
at
the
elbows
and
found
it
convenient
to
enter
for
a
time
on
the
less
expensive
life
of
the
continent
for
eighteen
months
she
had
been
staying
in
paris
the
education
of
her
younger
daughters
being
the
plea
put
forth
and
a
very
convenient
plea
it
is
and
serves
hundreds
isabel
had
two
or
three
letters
from
her
during
her
absence
and
she
now
received
another
saying
they
were
going
to
spend
a
month
or
two
at
carlyle
wainwright
and
martin
in
short
everybody
declared
this
must
remove
all
lady
isabel
s
unwillingness
to
go
from
home
for
ducie
s
society
would
do
away
with
the
loneliness
she
had
anticipated
which
had
been
the
ostensible
score
of
her
objection
of
all
places
in
the
world
remonstrated
lady
isabel
it
is
spoken
of
as
being
crowded
and
the
more
amusing
for
you
my
lady
cried
martin
while
carlyle
laughed
at
her
and
finding
she
had
no
chance
against
them
all
she
consented
to
go
and
plans
were
hastily
decided
upon
joyce
said
lady
isabel
to
her
waiting
maid
i
shall
leave
you
at
home
i
must
take
wilson
oh
my
lady
what
have
i
done
you
have
done
all
that
you
ought
joyce
but
you
must
stay
with
the
children
if
i
may
not
take
them
the
next
best
thing
will
be
to
leave
them
in
your
charge
not
miss
carlyle
s
she
said
shaking
her
voice
if
it
were
wilson
who
remained
i
could
not
do
my
lady
i
must
do
whatever
you
think
best
i
wish
i
could
attend
you
and
stay
with
them
but
of
course
i
can
not
do
i
am
sent
away
to
get
health
and
strength
but
it
may
be
that
i
shall
die
joyce
if
i
never
come
back
will
you
promise
to
remain
with
my
children
joyce
felt
a
creeping
sensation
in
her
veins
the
sobs
rose
in
her
throat
but
she
swallowed
them
down
and
constrained
her
voice
to
calmness
my
lady
i
hope
you
will
come
back
to
us
as
well
as
you
used
to
be
i
trust
you
will
hope
so
too
my
lady
and
not
give
way
to
low
i
sincerely
hope
and
trust
i
shall
answered
lady
isabel
fervently
still
there
s
no
telling
for
i
am
very
joyce
give
me
your
promise
in
case
of
the
worst
you
will
remain
with
the
i
will
my
lady
as
long
as
i
am
and
be
kind
to
them
and
love
them
and
shield
them
from
from
any
unkindness
that
may
be
put
upon
them
she
added
her
head
full
of
miss
carlyle
and
talk
to
them
sometimes
of
their
poor
mother
who
is
gone
i
will
i
will
oh
my
lady
i
will
and
joyce
sat
down
in
the
chair
as
lady
isabel
quitted
her
and
burst
into
tears
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
with
wilson
and
peter
in
attendance
arrived
at
boulogne
and
proceeded
to
the
hotel
des
bains
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
that
peter
had
been
transferred
from
miss
carlyle
s
service
to
theirs
when
the
establishment
was
first
formed
at
east
lynne
upon
entering
the
hotel
they
inquired
for
ducie
and
then
a
disappointment
awaited
them
a
letter
was
handed
them
which
had
arrived
that
morning
from
ducie
expressing
her
regret
that
certain
family
arrangements
prevented
her
visiting
boulogne
she
was
proceeding
to
some
of
the
baths
in
germany
instead
i
might
almost
have
known
it
remarked
isabel
she
was
always
the
most
changeable
of
carlyle
went
out
in
search
of
lodgings
isabel
objecting
to
remain
in
the
bustling
hotel
he
succeeded
in
finding
some
very
desirable
ones
situated
in
the
rue
de
l
ecu
near
the
port
and
they
moved
into
them
he
thought
the
journey
had
done
her
good
for
she
looked
better
and
said
she
already
felt
stronger
carlyle
remained
with
her
three
days
he
had
promised
only
one
but
he
was
pleased
with
everything
around
him
pleased
with
isabel
s
returning
glimpses
of
health
and
amused
with
the
scenes
of
the
busy
town
the
tide
served
at
eight
o
clock
the
following
morning
and
carlyle
left
by
the
folkestone
boat
wilson
made
his
breakfast
and
after
swallowing
it
in
haste
he
returned
to
his
wife
s
room
to
say
farewell
my
love
he
said
stooping
to
kiss
her
take
care
of
give
my
dear
love
to
the
darlings
archibald
and
and
and
what
he
asked
i
have
not
a
moment
to
do
not
get
making
love
to
barbara
hare
while
i
am
she
spoke
in
a
tone
half
jest
half
serious
could
he
but
have
seen
how
her
heart
was
breaking
carlyle
took
it
wholly
as
a
jest
and
went
away
laughing
had
he
believed
she
was
serious
he
could
have
been
little
more
surprised
had
she
charged
him
not
to
go
about
the
country
on
a
dromedary
isabel
rose
later
and
lingered
over
her
breakfast
listless
enough
she
was
wondering
how
she
would
make
the
next
few
weeks
pass
what
she
should
do
with
her
time
she
had
taken
two
sea
baths
since
her
arrival
but
they
had
appeared
not
to
agree
with
her
leaving
her
low
and
shivering
afterwards
so
it
was
not
deemed
advisable
that
she
should
attempt
more
it
was
a
lovely
morning
and
she
determined
to
venture
on
to
the
pier
to
where
they
had
sat
on
the
previous
evening
she
had
not
carlyle
s
arm
but
it
was
not
far
and
she
could
take
a
good
rest
at
the
end
of
it
she
went
attended
by
peter
took
her
seat
and
told
him
to
come
for
her
in
an
hour
she
watched
the
strollers
on
the
pier
as
they
had
done
the
previous
evening
not
in
crowds
now
but
stragglers
coming
on
at
intervals
there
came
a
gouty
man
in
a
list
shoe
there
came
three
young
ladies
and
their
governess
there
came
two
fast
puppies
in
shooting
jackets
and
which
they
turned
with
a
broad
stare
on
lady
isabel
but
there
was
something
about
her
which
caused
them
to
drop
their
glasses
and
their
ill
manners
together
after
an
interval
there
appeared
another
a
tall
handsome
gentlemanly
man
her
eyes
fell
upon
him
and
what
was
it
that
caused
every
nerve
in
her
frame
to
vibrate
every
pulse
to
quicken
whose
form
was
it
that
was
thus
advancing
and
changing
the
monotony
of
her
mind
into
tumult
it
was
that
of
one
whom
she
was
soon
to
find
had
never
been
entirely
forgotten
captain
levison
came
slowly
on
approaching
the
pier
where
she
sat
he
glanced
at
her
not
with
the
hardihood
displayed
by
the
two
young
men
but
with
quite
sufficiently
evident
admiration
what
a
lovely
girl
thought
he
to
himself
who
can
she
be
sitting
there
alone
all
at
once
a
recollection
flashed
into
his
mind
he
raised
his
hat
and
extended
his
hand
his
fascinating
smile
in
full
play
i
certainly
can
not
be
mistaken
have
i
the
honor
of
once
more
meeting
lady
isabel
vane
she
rose
from
the
seat
and
allowed
him
to
take
her
hand
answering
a
few
words
at
random
for
her
wits
seemed
i
beg
your
pardon
i
should
have
said
lady
isabel
carlyle
time
has
elapsed
since
we
parted
and
in
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
so
unexpectedly
i
thought
of
you
as
you
were
she
sat
down
again
the
brilliant
flush
of
emotion
dying
away
upon
her
cheeks
it
was
the
loveliest
face
francis
levison
had
seen
since
he
saw
hers
and
he
thought
so
as
he
gazed
at
it
what
can
have
brought
you
to
this
place
he
inquired
taking
a
seat
beside
her
i
have
been
ill
she
explained
and
am
ordered
to
the
we
should
not
have
come
here
but
for
ducie
we
expected
to
meet
her
carlyle
only
left
me
this
mrs
ducie
is
off
to
ems
i
see
them
occasionally
they
have
been
fixtures
in
paris
for
some
time
you
do
indeed
look
ill
he
abruptly
added
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
alarmingly
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
she
was
aware
that
she
looked
unusually
ill
at
that
moment
for
the
agitation
and
surprise
of
meeting
him
were
fading
away
leaving
her
face
an
ashy
whiteness
exceedingly
vexed
and
angry
with
herself
did
she
feel
that
the
meeting
should
have
power
to
call
forth
emotion
until
that
moment
she
was
unconscious
that
she
retained
any
sort
of
feeling
for
captain
levison
perhaps
i
have
ventured
out
too
early
she
said
in
a
tone
that
would
seem
to
apologize
for
her
looks
i
think
i
will
return
i
shall
meet
my
servant
no
doubt
captain
but
indeed
you
do
not
appear
fit
to
walk
alone
he
remonstrated
you
must
allow
me
to
see
you
safely
drawing
her
hand
within
his
own
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
as
he
had
done
many
a
time
in
days
gone
by
he
proceeded
to
assist
her
down
the
pier
lady
isabel
conscious
of
her
own
feelings
felt
that
it
was
not
quite
the
thing
to
walk
thus
familiarly
with
him
but
he
was
a
sort
of
relation
of
the
family
a
connection
at
any
rate
and
she
could
find
no
ready
excuse
for
declining
have
you
seen
lady
mount
severn
lately
he
inquired
i
saw
her
when
i
was
in
london
this
spring
with
carlyle
the
first
time
we
have
met
since
my
marriage
and
we
do
not
correspond
lord
mount
severn
had
paid
us
two
or
three
visits
at
east
lynne
they
are
in
town
yet
i
for
all
i
know
i
have
not
seen
them
or
england
either
for
ten
months
i
have
been
staying
in
paris
and
got
here
a
long
leave
of
absence
she
observed
oh
i
have
left
the
army
i
sold
out
the
truth
is
lady
isabel
for
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
things
are
rather
down
with
me
at
present
my
old
uncle
has
behaved
shamefully
he
has
married
i
heard
that
sir
peter
had
he
is
the
old
simpleton
of
course
this
materially
alters
my
prospects
for
it
is
just
possible
he
may
have
a
son
of
his
own
now
and
my
creditors
all
came
down
upon
me
they
allowed
me
to
run
into
debt
with
complacency
when
i
was
heir
to
the
title
and
estates
but
as
soon
as
sir
peter
s
marriage
appeared
in
the
papers
myself
and
my
consequence
dropped
a
hundred
per
cent
credit
was
stopped
and
i
dunned
for
payment
so
i
thought
i
d
cut
it
altogether
and
i
sold
out
and
came
leaving
your
creditors
what
else
could
i
do
my
uncle
would
not
pay
them
or
increase
my
what
are
your
prospects
then
resumed
lady
isabel
prospects
do
you
see
that
little
ragged
boy
throwing
stones
into
the
harbor
it
is
well
the
police
don
t
drop
upon
him
ask
him
what
his
prospects
are
and
he
will
stare
you
in
the
face
and
say
mine
are
on
a
like
you
may
succeed
sir
peter
i
may
but
i
may
not
when
those
old
idiots
get
a
young
wife
have
you
quarreled
with
sir
peter
interrupted
lady
isabel
i
should
quarrel
with
him
as
he
deserves
if
it
would
do
any
good
but
i
might
get
my
allowance
stopped
self
interest
you
see
lady
isabel
is
the
order
of
the
day
with
most
of
do
you
propose
staying
in
boulogne
long
i
don
t
know
as
i
may
find
amusement
paris
is
a
fast
capital
with
its
heated
rooms
and
its
late
hours
and
i
came
down
for
the
refreshment
of
a
few
sea
dips
am
i
walking
too
fast
for
you
you
increased
your
pace
alarmingly
when
you
spoke
of
sir
peter
s
marriage
and
i
am
not
sorry
for
it
she
added
for
it
has
proved
to
me
how
strong
i
am
getting
a
week
ago
i
could
not
have
walked
half
so
he
interrupted
with
eager
apologies
and
soon
they
reached
her
home
captain
levison
entered
with
her
uninvited
he
probably
deemed
between
connections
great
ceremonies
might
be
dispensed
with
and
he
sat
a
quarter
of
an
hour
chatting
to
amuse
her
when
he
rose
he
inquired
what
she
meant
to
do
with
herself
in
the
afternoon
to
lie
down
replied
isabel
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
sit
up
all
should
you
be
going
out
afterwards
you
must
allow
me
to
take
care
of
you
he
observed
i
am
glad
that
i
happened
to
be
here
for
i
am
sure
you
are
not
fit
to
wander
out
without
an
arm
and
only
followed
by
a
servant
when
carlyle
comes
he
will
thank
me
for
my
what
was
she
to
urge
in
objection
simply
nothing
he
spoke
let
us
not
doubt
from
a
genuine
wish
to
serve
her
in
a
plain
easy
tone
as
any
acquaintance
might
speak
lady
isabel
schooled
herself
severely
if
those
old
feelings
were
not
quite
dead
within
her
why
she
must
smother
them
down
again
as
effectually
as
if
they
were
the
very
fact
of
recognizing
such
to
her
own
heart
brought
a
glow
of
shame
to
her
brow
she
would
meet
captain
levison
and
suffer
his
companionship
as
she
would
that
of
the
most
indifferent
stranger
it
was
just
the
wrong
way
for
her
to
go
to
work
though
as
the
days
passed
on
lady
isabel
improved
wonderfully
she
was
soon
able
to
go
to
the
sands
in
the
morning
and
sit
there
to
enjoy
the
sea
air
watching
the
waves
come
up
to
recede
with
the
tide
she
made
no
acquaintance
whatever
in
the
place
and
when
she
had
a
companion
it
was
captain
levison
he
would
frequently
join
her
there
sometimes
take
her
almost
always
give
her
his
arm
home
of
all
things
she
disliked
the
having
to
take
his
arm
would
a
thousand
times
over
rather
have
taken
good
old
peter
s
a
secret
prick
of
the
conscience
whispered
it
might
be
better
if
she
did
not
one
day
she
said
in
a
joking
sort
of
manner
she
would
not
say
it
in
any
other
that
now
she
was
strong
she
had
no
need
of
his
arm
and
his
escort
he
demanded
in
evident
astonishment
what
had
arisen
that
he
might
not
still
afford
it
seeing
her
husband
was
not
with
her
to
give
her
his
she
had
no
answer
in
reply
to
this
no
excuse
to
urge
and
in
default
of
one
took
his
arm
as
usual
in
the
evening
he
would
be
ready
to
take
her
to
the
pier
but
they
sat
apart
mixing
not
with
the
bustling
crowd
he
lending
to
his
manner
as
he
conversed
with
her
all
that
he
would
call
up
of
fascination
and
fascination
such
as
francis
levison
s
might
be
dangerous
to
any
ear
in
the
sweet
evening
twilight
the
walk
over
he
left
her
at
her
own
door
she
never
asked
him
in
in
the
evening
and
he
did
not
intrude
without
as
he
sometimes
would
of
a
morning
now
where
was
the
help
for
this
you
may
say
that
she
should
have
remained
indoors
and
not
have
subjected
herself
to
his
companionship
but
the
remaining
indoors
would
not
have
brought
her
health
and
it
was
health
that
she
was
staying
in
boulogne
to
acquire
and
the
sooner
it
came
the
better
pleased
she
would
be
for
she
wanted
to
be
at
home
with
her
husband
and
children
in
a
fortnight
from
the
period
of
his
departure
carlyle
was
expected
in
boulogne
but
what
a
marvellous
change
had
this
fortnight
wrought
in
lady
isabel
she
did
not
dare
to
analyze
her
feelings
but
she
was
conscious
that
all
the
fresh
emotions
of
her
youth
had
come
again
the
blue
sky
seemed
as
of
the
sweetest
sapphire
the
green
fields
and
waving
trees
were
of
an
emerald
brightness
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
was
more
fragrant
than
any
perfume
had
yet
seemed
she
knew
that
the
sky
that
the
grassy
plains
the
leafy
trees
the
brilliant
flowers
were
but
as
they
ever
had
been
she
knew
that
the
sunny
atmosphere
possessed
no
more
of
loveliness
or
power
of
imparting
delight
than
of
old
and
she
knew
that
the
change
the
sensation
of
ecstacy
was
in
her
own
heart
no
wonder
that
she
shrank
from
the
change
from
listless
languor
to
her
present
feeling
brought
the
hue
and
contour
of
health
to
her
face
far
sooner
than
anything
else
could
have
done
she
went
down
with
captain
levison
to
meet
carlyle
the
evening
he
came
in
and
when
carlyle
saw
her
behind
the
cords
as
he
was
going
to
the
he
scarcely
knew
her
her
features
had
lost
their
sharpness
her
cheeks
wore
a
rosy
flush
and
the
light
of
pleasure
at
meeting
him
again
shone
in
her
eyes
what
can
you
have
been
doing
to
yourself
my
darling
he
uttered
in
delight
as
he
emerged
from
the
and
took
her
hands
in
his
you
look
almost
yes
i
am
much
better
archibald
but
i
am
warm
now
and
flushed
we
have
waited
here
some
time
and
the
setting
sun
was
full
upon
us
how
long
the
boat
was
in
coming
in
the
wind
was
against
us
replied
carlyle
wondering
who
the
exquisite
was
at
his
wife
s
side
he
thought
he
remembered
his
face
captain
levison
said
lady
isabel
i
wrote
you
word
in
one
of
my
letters
that
he
was
here
have
you
forgotten
it
yes
it
had
slipped
from
his
memory
and
i
am
happy
that
it
happened
so
said
that
gentleman
interposing
for
it
has
enabled
me
to
attend
lady
isabel
in
some
of
her
walks
she
is
stronger
now
but
at
first
she
was
unfit
to
venture
i
feel
much
indebted
to
you
said
carlyle
warmly
the
following
day
was
sunday
and
francis
levison
was
asked
to
dine
with
them
the
first
meal
he
had
been
invited
to
in
the
house
after
dinner
when
lady
isabel
left
them
he
grew
confidential
over
his
claret
to
carlyle
laying
open
all
his
intricate
affairs
and
his
cargo
of
troubles
this
compulsory
exile
abroad
is
becoming
intolerable
he
concluded
and
a
paris
life
plays
the
very
deuce
with
one
do
you
see
any
chance
of
my
getting
back
to
england
not
the
least
was
the
candid
answer
unless
you
can
manage
to
satisfy
or
partially
satisfy
those
claims
you
have
been
telling
me
of
will
not
sir
peter
assist
you
i
believe
he
would
were
the
case
fairly
represented
to
him
but
how
am
i
to
get
over
to
do
it
i
have
written
several
letters
to
him
lately
and
for
some
time
i
got
no
reply
then
came
an
epistle
from
lady
levison
not
short
and
sweet
but
short
and
sour
it
was
to
the
effect
that
sir
peter
was
ill
and
could
not
at
present
be
troubled
with
business
he
can
not
be
very
ill
remarked
carlyle
he
passed
through
west
lynne
in
his
open
carriage
a
week
he
ought
to
help
me
grumbled
captain
levison
i
am
his
heir
so
long
as
lady
levison
does
not
give
him
one
i
do
not
hear
that
she
has
you
should
contrive
to
see
i
know
i
should
but
it
is
not
possible
under
present
circumstances
with
these
hanging
over
me
i
dare
not
set
foot
in
england
and
run
the
risk
to
be
dropped
upon
i
can
stand
a
few
things
but
i
shudder
at
the
bare
idea
of
a
prison
something
peculiar
in
my
idiosyncrasy
i
take
it
for
those
who
have
tried
it
say
that
it
s
nothing
when
you
re
used
to
some
one
might
see
him
for
some
one
who
i
have
quarreled
with
my
lawyers
sharp
steel
of
lincoln
s
keen
practitioners
put
in
carlyle
too
keen
for
me
i
d
send
them
over
the
if
i
could
they
have
used
me
shamefully
since
my
uncle
s
marriage
if
ever
i
do
come
into
the
levison
estates
they
ll
be
ready
to
eat
their
ears
off
they
would
like
a
finger
in
a
pie
with
such
property
as
shall
i
see
sir
peter
levison
for
you
will
you
returned
captain
levison
his
dark
eyes
lighting
up
if
you
like
as
your
friend
you
understand
not
as
your
solicitor
that
i
decline
i
have
a
slight
knowledge
of
sir
peter
my
father
was
well
acquainted
with
him
and
if
i
can
render
you
any
little
service
i
shall
be
happy
in
return
for
your
kind
attention
to
my
wife
i
can
not
promise
to
see
him
for
those
two
or
three
weeks
though
resumed
carlyle
for
we
are
terribly
busy
i
never
was
so
driven
but
for
being
so
i
should
stay
here
with
my
francis
levison
expressed
his
gratitude
and
the
prospect
however
remote
of
being
enabled
to
return
to
england
increased
his
spirits
to
exultation
whilst
they
continued
to
converse
lady
isabel
sat
at
the
window
in
the
adjoining
room
listlessly
looking
out
on
the
crowds
of
french
who
were
crowding
to
and
from
the
port
in
their
sunday
holiday
attire
looking
at
them
with
her
eyes
not
with
her
senses
her
senses
were
holding
commune
with
herself
and
it
was
not
altogether
satisfactory
she
was
aware
that
a
sensation
all
too
warm
a
feeling
of
attraction
toward
francis
levison
was
working
within
her
not
a
voluntary
one
she
could
no
more
repress
it
than
she
could
repress
her
own
sense
of
being
and
mixed
with
it
was
the
stern
voice
of
conscience
overwhelming
her
with
the
most
lively
terror
she
would
have
given
all
she
possessed
to
be
able
to
overcome
it
she
would
have
given
half
the
years
of
her
future
life
to
separate
herself
at
once
and
forever
from
the
man
but
do
not
mistake
the
word
terror
or
suppose
that
lady
isabel
carlyle
applied
it
here
in
the
vulgar
acceptation
of
the
term
she
did
not
fear
for
herself
none
could
be
more
conscious
of
of
principle
and
conduct
and
she
would
have
believed
it
as
impossible
for
her
ever
to
forsake
her
duty
as
a
wife
a
gentlewoman
and
a
christian
as
for
the
sun
to
turn
round
from
west
to
east
that
was
not
the
fear
which
possessed
her
it
had
never
presented
itself
to
her
mind
what
she
did
fear
was
that
further
companionship
with
francis
levison
might
augment
the
sentiments
she
entertained
for
him
to
a
height
that
her
life
for
perhaps
years
to
come
would
be
one
of
unhappiness
a
sort
of
concealment
and
more
than
all
she
shrank
from
the
consciousness
of
the
bitter
wrong
that
these
sentiments
cast
upon
her
husband
archibald
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
you
she
said
after
captain
levison
s
departure
take
me
back
with
impossible
my
love
the
change
is
doing
you
so
much
good
and
i
took
the
apartments
for
six
weeks
you
must
at
least
remain
that
the
color
flowed
painfully
into
her
cheek
i
can
not
stay
without
you
tell
me
i
am
so
dull
without
you
was
all
she
could
say
he
felt
that
this
was
not
reason
enough
for
altering
an
arrangement
that
was
so
beneficial
to
her
so
he
left
her
the
following
morning
commending
her
to
the
continued
care
of
captain
levison
chapter
xxi
quitting
the
danger
lady
isabel
was
seated
on
one
of
the
benches
of
the
petit
camp
as
it
is
called
underneath
the
ramparts
of
the
upper
tower
a
week
or
ten
days
had
passed
away
since
the
departure
of
carlyle
and
in
her
health
there
was
a
further
visible
improvement
it
was
still
evening
cool
for
july
no
sound
was
heard
save
the
hum
of
the
summer
insects
and
lady
isabel
sat
in
silence
with
her
companion
her
rebellious
heart
beating
with
a
sense
of
its
own
happiness
but
for
the
voice
of
conscience
strong
within
her
but
for
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
but
for
the
existing
things
in
short
but
that
she
was
a
wife
she
might
have
been
content
to
sit
by
his
side
forever
never
to
wish
to
move
or
to
break
the
silence
did
he
read
her
feelings
he
told
her
months
afterward
that
he
did
but
it
may
have
been
a
vain
boast
an
excuse
do
you
remember
the
evening
lady
isabel
just
such
a
one
as
this
that
we
all
passed
at
richmond
he
suddenly
asked
your
father
vane
you
i
and
others
yes
i
remember
it
we
had
spent
a
pleasant
day
the
two
miss
challoners
were
with
us
you
drove
vane
home
and
i
went
with
papa
you
drove
recklessly
i
recollect
and
vane
said
when
we
got
home
that
you
should
never
drive
her
which
meant
not
until
the
next
time
of
all
capricious
vain
exacting
women
emma
vane
was
the
worst
and
emma
mount
severn
is
no
improvement
upon
it
she
s
a
systematic
flirt
and
nothing
better
i
drove
recklessly
on
purpose
to
put
her
in
a
fright
and
pay
her
what
had
she
done
put
me
in
a
rage
she
had
saddled
herself
upon
me
when
i
wanted
i
wished
for
another
to
be
my
blanche
blanche
challoner
echoed
captain
levison
in
a
mocking
tone
what
did
i
care
for
blanche
challoner
isabel
remembered
that
he
had
been
supposed
in
those
days
to
care
a
great
deal
for
miss
blanche
challoner
a
most
lovely
girl
of
seventeen
mrs
vane
used
to
accuse
you
of
caring
too
much
for
her
she
said
aloud
she
accused
me
of
caring
for
some
one
else
more
than
for
blanche
challoner
he
significantly
returned
and
for
once
her
jealous
surmises
were
not
misplaced
no
lady
isabel
it
was
not
blanche
challoner
i
had
wished
to
drive
home
could
you
not
have
given
a
better
guess
than
that
at
the
time
he
added
turning
to
her
there
was
no
mistaking
the
tone
of
his
voice
or
the
glance
of
his
eye
lady
isabel
felt
a
crimson
flush
rising
and
she
turned
her
face
away
the
past
is
gone
and
can
not
be
recalled
he
continued
but
we
both
played
our
cards
like
simpletons
if
ever
two
beings
were
formed
to
love
each
other
you
and
i
were
i
sometimes
thought
you
read
my
feelings
surprise
had
kept
her
silent
but
she
interrupted
him
now
haughtily
enough
i
must
speak
lady
isabel
it
is
but
a
few
words
and
then
i
am
silent
forever
i
would
have
declared
myself
had
i
dared
but
my
uncertain
position
my
debts
my
inability
to
keep
a
wife
weighed
me
down
and
instead
of
appealing
to
sir
peter
as
i
ought
to
have
done
for
the
means
to
assume
a
position
that
would
justify
me
in
asking
lord
mount
severn
s
daughter
i
crushed
my
hopes
within
me
and
suffered
you
to
escape
i
will
not
hear
this
captain
levison
she
cried
rising
from
her
seat
in
anger
he
touched
her
arm
to
place
her
on
it
again
one
single
moment
yet
i
pray
you
i
have
for
years
wished
that
you
should
know
why
i
lost
you
a
loss
that
tells
upon
me
yet
i
have
bitterly
worked
out
my
own
folly
since
i
knew
not
how
passionately
i
loved
you
until
you
became
the
wife
of
another
isabel
i
love
you
passionately
how
dare
you
presume
so
to
address
me
she
spoke
in
a
cold
dignified
tone
of
hauteur
as
it
was
her
bounden
duty
to
speak
but
nevertheless
she
was
conscious
of
an
undercurrent
of
feeling
whispering
that
under
other
auspices
the
avowal
would
have
brought
to
her
heart
the
most
intense
bliss
what
i
have
said
can
do
no
hurt
now
resumed
captain
levison
the
time
has
gone
by
for
it
for
neither
you
nor
i
are
likely
to
forget
that
you
are
a
wife
we
have
each
chosen
our
path
in
life
and
must
abide
by
it
the
gulf
between
us
is
impassable
but
the
fault
was
mine
i
ought
to
have
avowed
my
affection
and
not
have
suffered
you
to
throw
yourself
away
upon
throw
myself
away
she
indignantly
uttered
roused
to
the
retort
mr
carlyle
is
my
dear
husband
esteemed
respected
and
beloved
i
married
him
of
my
own
free
choice
and
i
have
never
repented
it
i
have
grown
more
attached
to
him
day
by
day
look
at
his
noble
nature
his
noble
form
what
are
you
by
his
side
you
forget
yourself
francis
he
bit
his
lip
no
i
do
you
are
talking
to
me
as
you
have
no
right
to
talk
she
exclaimed
in
agitation
who
but
you
would
so
insult
me
taking
advantage
of
my
momentarily
unprotected
condition
would
you
dare
to
do
it
were
carlyle
within
reach
i
wish
you
she
walked
away
as
quickly
as
her
tired
frame
would
permit
captain
levison
strode
after
her
he
took
forcible
possession
of
her
hand
and
placed
it
within
his
arm
i
pray
you
forgive
and
forget
what
has
escaped
me
lady
isabel
suffer
me
to
be
as
before
the
kind
friend
the
anxious
brother
endeavoring
to
be
of
service
to
you
in
the
absence
of
it
is
what
i
have
suffered
you
to
be
looking
upon
you
as
i
may
say
a
relative
she
coldly
rejoined
withdrawing
her
hand
from
his
contact
not
else
should
i
have
permitted
your
incessant
companionship
and
this
is
how
you
have
repaid
it
my
husband
thanked
you
for
your
attention
to
me
could
he
have
read
what
was
in
your
false
heart
he
had
offered
you
different
sort
of
thanks
i
i
ask
your
pardon
lady
isabel
i
have
acknowledged
my
fault
and
i
can
do
no
more
i
will
not
so
offend
again
but
there
are
moments
when
our
dearest
feelings
break
through
the
convenances
of
life
and
betray
themselves
in
spite
of
our
sober
judgment
suffer
me
to
support
you
down
this
steep
hill
he
added
for
they
were
then
going
over
the
sharp
stones
of
the
grand
rue
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
proceed
alone
after
this
evening
s
long
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
she
said
with
some
sarcasm
in
her
tone
no
i
have
so
she
had
to
put
his
arm
back
which
he
was
holding
out
as
she
walked
on
unsupported
with
what
strength
she
had
he
continuing
by
her
side
arriving
at
her
own
door
she
wished
him
a
cool
and
he
turned
away
in
the
direction
of
his
hotel
lady
isabel
brushed
past
peter
and
flew
upstairs
startling
wilson
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
to
air
her
smart
cap
at
its
windows
in
the
absence
of
her
lady
my
desk
wilson
immediately
cried
she
tearing
off
her
gloves
her
bonnet
and
her
shawl
tell
peter
to
be
in
readiness
to
take
a
letter
to
the
post
and
he
must
walk
fast
or
he
will
not
catch
it
before
the
english
mail
is
the
symptoms
of
sinful
happiness
throbbing
at
her
heart
while
francis
levison
told
her
of
his
love
spoke
plainly
to
lady
isabel
of
the
expediency
of
withdrawing
entirely
from
his
society
and
his
dangerous
sophistries
she
would
be
away
from
the
very
place
that
contained
him
put
the
sea
between
them
so
she
dashed
off
a
letter
to
her
husband
an
urgent
summons
that
he
should
come
to
her
without
delay
for
remain
away
longer
she
would
not
it
is
probable
she
would
have
started
alone
not
waiting
for
carlyle
but
for
fear
of
not
having
sufficient
funds
for
the
journey
after
the
rent
and
other
things
were
paid
carlyle
when
he
received
the
letter
and
marked
its
earnest
tone
wondered
much
in
reply
he
stated
that
he
would
be
with
her
on
the
following
saturday
and
then
her
returning
or
not
with
him
could
be
settled
fully
determined
not
to
meet
captain
levison
isabel
in
the
intervening
days
only
went
out
in
a
carriage
he
called
once
and
was
shown
into
the
but
lady
isabel
who
happened
to
be
in
her
own
chamber
sent
out
a
message
which
was
delivered
by
peter
my
lady
s
compliments
but
she
must
decline
receiving
sunday
morning
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
get
away
before
brought
carlyle
he
strongly
combatted
her
wish
to
return
home
until
six
weeks
should
have
expired
he
nearly
said
he
would
not
take
her
and
she
grew
earnest
over
it
almost
to
agitation
isabel
he
said
let
me
know
your
motive
for
it
appears
to
me
you
have
one
the
sojourn
here
is
evidently
doing
you
a
vast
deal
of
good
and
what
you
urge
about
being
dull
sounds
very
like
nonsense
tell
me
what
it
a
sudden
impulse
flashed
over
her
that
she
would
tell
him
the
truth
not
tell
him
that
she
loved
francis
levison
or
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
as
he
did
she
valued
her
husband
too
greatly
to
draw
him
into
any
unpleasantness
whose
end
could
not
be
seen
but
own
to
him
that
she
had
once
felt
a
passing
fancy
for
francis
levison
and
preferred
not
to
be
subjected
to
his
companionship
now
oh
that
she
had
done
so
her
kind
her
noble
her
judicious
husband
why
did
she
not
the
whole
truth
as
to
her
present
feelings
it
was
not
expedient
that
she
should
tell
but
she
might
have
confided
to
him
quite
sufficient
he
would
only
have
cherished
her
the
more
deeply
and
sheltered
her
under
his
fostering
care
safe
from
harm
why
did
she
not
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
was
about
to
do
so
when
carlyle
who
had
been
taking
a
letter
from
his
pocket
book
put
it
into
her
hand
upon
what
slight
threads
the
events
of
life
turn
her
thoughts
diverted
she
remained
silent
while
she
opened
the
letter
it
was
from
miss
carlyle
who
had
handed
it
to
her
brother
in
the
moment
of
his
departure
to
carry
to
lady
isabel
and
save
postage
carlyle
had
nearly
dropped
it
into
the
folkestone
post
office
a
letter
as
stiff
as
miss
corny
herself
the
children
were
well
and
the
house
was
going
on
well
and
she
hoped
lady
isabel
was
better
it
filled
three
sides
of
note
paper
but
that
was
all
the
news
it
contained
and
it
wound
up
with
the
following
sentence
i
would
continue
my
epistle
but
barbara
hare
who
is
to
spend
the
day
with
us
has
just
barbara
hare
spending
the
day
at
east
lynne
that
item
was
quite
enough
for
lady
isabel
and
her
heart
and
her
confidence
closed
to
her
husband
she
must
go
home
to
her
children
she
urged
she
could
not
remain
longer
away
from
them
and
she
urged
it
at
length
with
tears
nay
isabel
said
carlyle
if
you
are
so
much
in
earnest
as
this
you
shall
certainly
go
back
with
then
she
was
like
a
child
let
loose
from
school
she
laughed
she
danced
in
her
excess
of
content
she
showered
kisses
on
her
husband
thanking
him
in
her
gleeful
gratitude
carlyle
set
it
down
to
her
love
for
him
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
in
reiterating
that
she
could
not
bear
to
be
away
from
him
she
spoke
the
fond
truth
isabel
he
said
smiling
tenderly
upon
her
do
you
remember
in
the
first
days
of
our
marriage
you
told
me
you
did
not
yet
love
me
but
that
the
love
would
come
i
think
this
is
her
face
flushed
nearly
to
tears
at
the
words
a
bright
glowing
all
too
conscious
flush
carlyle
mistook
its
source
and
caught
her
to
his
heart
lady
isabel
had
returned
home
to
bodily
health
to
the
delight
of
meeting
her
children
to
the
glad
sensation
of
security
but
as
the
days
went
on
a
miserable
feeling
of
apathy
stole
over
her
a
feeling
as
if
all
whom
she
had
loved
in
the
world
had
died
leaving
her
living
and
alone
she
did
not
encourage
these
reflections
knowing
what
you
do
know
of
her
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
they
thrust
themselves
continually
forward
the
form
of
francis
levison
was
ever
present
to
her
not
a
minute
of
the
day
but
it
gave
the
coloring
to
her
thoughts
and
at
night
it
made
the
subject
of
her
dreams
oh
those
dreams
they
were
painful
to
wake
from
painful
from
the
contrasts
they
presented
to
reality
and
equally
painful
to
her
conscience
in
its
strife
after
what
was
right
carlyle
mounted
his
horse
one
morning
and
rode
over
to
levison
park
he
asked
for
sir
peter
but
was
shown
into
the
presence
of
lady
young
and
pretty
woman
dressed
showily
she
inquired
his
business
my
business
madam
is
with
sir
but
sir
peter
is
not
well
enough
to
attend
to
business
it
upsets
him
worries
nevertheless
i
am
here
by
his
own
appointment
twelve
o
clock
he
mentioned
and
the
hour
has
barely
lady
levison
bit
her
lip
and
bowed
coldly
and
at
that
moment
a
servant
appeared
to
conduct
carlyle
to
sir
peter
the
matter
which
had
taken
carlyle
thither
was
entered
upon
immediately
francis
levison
his
debts
and
his
gracelessness
sir
peter
an
old
gentleman
in
a
velvet
skullcap
particularly
enlarged
upon
the
latter
i
d
pay
his
debts
and
set
him
upon
his
legs
again
but
that
i
know
i
should
have
to
do
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
as
i
have
done
it
repeatedly
hitherto
cried
sir
peter
his
grandfather
was
my
only
brother
his
father
my
dutiful
and
beloved
nephew
but
he
is
just
as
bad
as
they
were
estimable
he
is
a
worthless
fellow
and
nothing
else
his
tale
drew
forth
my
compassion
and
i
promised
i
would
see
you
and
speak
for
him
returned
carlyle
of
captain
levison
s
personal
virtues
or
vices
i
know
and
the
less
you
know
the
better
growled
sir
peter
i
suppose
he
wants
me
to
clear
him
and
start
him
something
of
that
sort
i
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
i
am
at
home
and
he
is
over
there
his
affairs
are
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
nobody
can
come
to
the
bottom
of
them
without
an
explanation
from
him
some
liabilities
for
which
i
have
furnished
the
money
the
creditors
swear
have
not
been
liquidated
he
must
come
over
if
he
wants
anything
where
is
he
to
come
to
he
must
be
in
england
sub
he
can
t
be
here
hastily
rejoined
sir
peter
lady
levison
would
not
have
him
for
a
he
might
be
at
east
lynne
observed
carlyle
nobody
would
think
of
looking
for
him
there
i
think
it
is
a
pity
that
you
should
not
meet
if
you
do
feel
inclined
to
help
you
are
a
deal
more
considerate
to
him
than
he
deserves
carlyle
may
i
ask
if
you
intend
to
act
for
him
in
a
professional
capacity
i
do
a
few
more
words
and
it
was
decided
that
captain
levison
should
be
immediately
sent
for
as
carlyle
left
sir
peter
s
presence
he
encountered
lady
levison
i
can
scarcely
be
ignorant
that
your
conference
with
my
husband
has
reference
to
his
grandnephew
she
observed
it
has
replied
carlyle
i
have
had
a
very
bad
opinion
of
him
carlyle
at
the
same
time
i
do
not
wish
you
to
carry
away
a
wrong
impression
of
me
francis
levison
is
my
husband
s
nephew
his
presumptive
heir
it
may
therefore
appear
strange
that
i
set
my
face
against
him
two
or
three
years
ago
previous
to
my
marriage
with
sir
peter
in
fact
before
i
knew
sir
peter
i
was
brought
into
contact
with
francis
levison
he
got
acquainted
with
some
friends
of
mine
and
at
their
house
i
met
him
he
behaved
shamefully
ill
he
repaid
their
hospitality
with
gross
ingratitude
other
details
and
facts
regarding
his
conduct
also
became
known
to
me
altogether
i
believe
him
to
be
a
base
and
despicable
man
both
by
nature
and
inclination
and
that
he
will
remain
such
to
the
end
of
i
know
very
little
indeed
of
him
observed
carlyle
may
i
inquire
the
nature
of
his
in
that
instance
he
ruined
them
he
ruined
them
carlyle
they
were
simple
unsuspicious
country
people
understanding
neither
fraud
nor
vice
nor
the
ways
of
an
evil
world
francis
levison
got
them
to
put
their
names
to
bills
as
a
matter
of
form
to
accommodate
him
for
a
month
or
so
he
stated
and
so
they
believed
they
were
not
wealthy
they
lived
upon
their
own
small
estate
with
none
too
much
of
superfluous
money
to
spare
and
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
pay
as
come
it
did
it
brought
ruin
and
they
had
to
leave
their
home
he
deliberately
did
it
knowing
what
would
be
the
end
and
i
could
tell
you
of
other
things
sir
peter
may
have
informed
you
that
i
object
to
receive
him
here
i
do
my
objection
is
to
the
man
to
his
character
not
owing
as
i
hear
it
has
been
said
to
any
jealous
paltry
feeling
touching
his
being
the
heir
i
must
lose
my
own
before
i
admit
francis
levison
to
my
house
as
an
inmate
sir
peter
may
assist
him
in
welcome
may
pay
his
debt
and
get
him
out
of
his
scrapes
as
often
as
he
pleases
but
i
will
not
have
him
sir
peter
said
you
declined
to
receive
him
but
it
is
necessary
that
he
should
come
to
england
if
his
affairs
are
to
be
set
straight
and
also
that
he
should
see
sir
come
to
england
interrupted
lady
levison
how
can
he
come
to
england
under
present
circumstances
unless
indeed
he
comes
en
cachette
en
cachette
of
course
replied
carlyle
there
is
no
other
way
i
have
offered
to
let
him
stay
at
east
lynne
he
is
you
may
be
aware
a
sort
of
connection
of
lady
isabel
take
care
that
he
does
not
repay
your
hospitality
with
ingratitude
warmly
returned
lady
levison
it
would
only
be
in
accordance
with
his
carlyle
laughed
i
do
not
see
what
harm
he
could
do
me
allowing
that
he
had
the
inclination
he
would
not
scare
my
clients
from
me
or
beat
my
children
and
i
can
take
care
of
my
pocket
a
few
days
will
no
doubt
be
the
extent
of
his
lady
levison
smiled
too
and
shook
hands
with
carlyle
in
your
house
perhaps
there
may
be
no
field
for
his
vagaries
but
rely
upon
it
where
there
is
one
he
is
sure
to
be
at
some
mischief
or
this
visit
of
carlyle
s
to
levison
park
took
place
on
a
friday
morning
and
on
his
return
to
his
office
he
dispatched
an
account
of
it
to
captain
levison
at
boulogne
telling
him
he
had
better
come
over
but
now
carlyle
like
many
another
man
whose
mind
has
its
share
of
work
was
sometimes
forgetful
of
trifles
and
it
entirely
slipped
his
memory
to
mention
the
expected
arrival
at
home
the
following
evening
saturday
he
and
lady
isabel
were
dining
in
the
neighborhood
when
the
conversation
at
table
turned
upon
the
ducies
and
their
embarrassments
the
association
of
ideas
led
carlyle
s
thoughts
to
boulogne
to
captain
levison
and
his
embarrassments
and
it
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
told
his
wife
of
the
anticipated
visit
he
kept
it
in
his
mind
then
and
spoke
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
chariot
returning
home
isabel
began
he
i
suppose
we
have
always
rooms
ready
for
visitors
because
i
am
expecting
oh
yes
or
if
not
they
are
soon
made
ah
but
s
sunday
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
s
the
day
he
will
take
advantage
of
to
come
i
am
sorry
i
forgot
to
mention
it
who
is
coming
then
captain
who
repeated
lady
isabel
in
a
sharp
tone
of
consternation
captain
levison
sir
peter
consents
to
see
him
with
a
view
to
the
settlement
of
his
liabilities
but
lady
levison
declines
to
receive
him
at
the
park
so
i
offered
to
give
him
at
east
lynne
for
a
few
there
is
an
old
saying
the
heart
leaping
into
the
mouth
and
lady
isabel
s
leaped
into
hers
she
grew
dizzy
at
the
words
her
senses
seemed
momentarily
to
desert
her
her
first
sensation
was
as
if
the
dull
earth
had
opened
and
shown
her
a
way
into
paradise
her
second
a
lively
consciousness
that
francis
levison
ought
not
to
be
suffered
to
come
again
into
companionship
with
her
carlyle
continued
to
converse
of
the
man
s
embarrassments
of
his
own
interview
with
sir
peter
and
lady
levison
but
isabel
was
as
one
who
heard
not
she
was
debating
the
question
how
she
could
prevent
his
coming
archibald
she
presently
said
i
do
not
wish
francis
levison
to
stay
at
east
it
will
only
be
for
a
few
days
perhaps
but
a
day
or
two
sir
peter
is
in
the
humor
to
discharge
the
claims
and
the
moment
his
resolve
is
known
the
can
walk
on
her
majesty
s
dominions
an
unmolested
man
free
to
go
where
he
that
may
be
interrupted
lady
isabel
in
an
accent
of
impatience
but
why
should
he
come
to
our
house
i
proposed
it
myself
i
had
no
idea
you
would
dislike
his
coming
why
should
you
i
don
t
like
francis
levison
she
murmured
that
is
i
don
t
care
to
have
him
at
east
my
dear
i
fear
there
is
no
help
for
it
now
he
is
most
likely
on
his
road
and
will
arrive
i
can
not
turn
him
out
again
after
my
own
voluntary
invitation
had
i
known
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
you
i
would
not
have
proposed
she
exclaimed
all
the
words
that
caught
her
ear
is
he
coming
being
sunday
a
free
day
he
will
be
sure
to
take
advantage
of
it
what
has
he
done
that
you
should
object
to
his
coming
you
did
not
say
in
boulogne
that
you
disliked
he
had
done
nothing
was
her
faltering
answer
feeling
that
her
grounds
of
opposition
must
melt
under
her
one
by
one
lady
levison
appears
to
possess
a
very
ill
opinion
of
him
resumed
carlyle
she
says
she
knew
him
in
years
gone
by
she
mentioned
one
or
two
things
which
if
true
must
be
bad
enough
but
possibly
she
may
be
she
is
prejudiced
said
isabel
at
least
francis
levison
told
me
at
boulogne
there
appeared
to
be
no
love
lost
between
at
any
rate
his
ill
doings
or
well
doings
can
not
affect
us
for
the
short
period
he
is
likely
to
remain
you
have
taken
a
prejudice
against
him
also
i
suppose
she
suffered
carlyle
to
remain
in
the
belief
and
sat
with
clasped
hands
and
a
despairing
spirit
feeling
that
fate
was
against
her
how
could
she
accomplish
her
task
of
forgetting
this
man
if
he
was
thus
to
be
thrown
into
her
home
and
her
companionship
suddenly
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
his
shoulder
he
thought
she
was
tired
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
drew
her
face
to
a
more
comfortable
position
and
bent
his
own
lovingly
upon
it
it
came
to
her
mind
as
she
lay
there
to
tell
him
a
portion
of
the
truth
like
it
had
done
once
before
it
was
a
strong
arm
of
shelter
that
round
her
a
powerful
pillar
of
protection
him
upon
whom
she
leaned
why
did
she
not
confide
herself
to
him
as
trustingly
as
a
little
child
simply
because
her
courage
failed
once
twice
the
opening
words
were
upon
her
lips
but
come
forth
they
did
not
and
then
the
carriage
stopped
at
east
lynne
and
the
opportunity
was
over
oh
how
many
a
time
in
her
after
years
did
lady
isabel
recall
that
midnight
drive
with
her
husband
and
wish
in
her
vain
repentance
that
she
had
opened
his
eyes
to
that
dangerous
man
on
sunday
captain
levison
arrived
at
east
lynne
chapter
xxii
hare
s
dream
the
next
day
rose
bright
warm
and
cloudless
and
the
morning
sun
streamed
into
the
bedroom
of
hare
and
hare
were
of
the
class
who
knew
nothing
about
their
bedrooms
were
very
large
and
they
never
used
a
in
their
lives
or
found
the
want
of
one
the
justice
rubbed
his
face
to
a
shining
brilliancy
settled
on
his
morning
wig
and
his
and
then
turned
to
the
bed
what
will
you
have
for
breakfast
thank
you
richard
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
eat
any
thing
i
shall
be
glad
of
my
tea
i
am
very
all
nonsense
responded
the
justice
alluding
to
the
intimation
of
not
eating
have
a
poached
hare
smiled
at
him
and
gently
shook
her
head
you
are
very
kind
richard
but
i
could
not
eat
it
this
morning
barbara
may
send
up
the
smallest
bit
of
dry
toast
would
you
please
throw
the
window
open
before
you
go
down
i
should
like
to
feel
the
you
will
get
the
air
too
near
from
this
window
replied
justice
hare
opening
the
further
one
had
his
wife
requested
that
the
further
one
to
be
opened
he
would
have
opened
the
other
his
own
will
and
opinions
were
ever
paramount
then
he
descended
a
minute
or
two
and
up
ran
barbara
looking
bright
and
fair
as
the
morning
her
pink
muslin
dress
with
its
ribbons
and
its
open
white
lace
sleeves
as
pretty
as
she
was
she
leaned
over
to
kiss
her
mother
mamma
are
you
ill
and
you
have
been
so
well
lately
you
went
to
bed
so
well
last
night
papa
says
barbara
dear
interrupted
hare
glancing
round
the
room
with
dread
and
speaking
in
a
deep
whisper
i
have
had
one
of
those
dreadful
dreams
oh
mamma
how
can
you
exclaimed
barbara
starting
up
in
vexation
how
can
you
suffer
a
foolish
dream
to
overcome
you
as
to
make
you
ill
you
have
good
sense
in
other
matters
but
in
this
you
seem
to
put
all
sense
away
from
child
will
you
tell
me
how
i
am
to
help
it
returned
hare
taking
barbara
s
hand
and
drawing
her
to
her
again
i
do
not
give
myself
the
dreams
i
can
not
prevent
their
making
me
sick
prostrate
feverish
how
can
i
help
these
things
i
ask
at
this
moment
the
bedroom
door
was
flung
open
and
the
face
of
the
justice
especially
stern
and
cross
then
was
pushed
in
so
startled
was
hare
that
she
shook
till
she
shook
the
pillow
and
barbara
sprang
away
from
the
bed
surely
he
had
not
distinguished
their
topic
of
conversation
are
you
coming
to
make
the
breakfast
or
not
barbara
do
you
expect
me
to
make
it
she
is
coming
this
instant
richard
said
hare
her
voice
more
faint
than
usual
and
the
justice
turned
and
stamped
down
again
barbara
could
your
papa
have
heard
me
mention
richard
no
no
mamma
impossible
the
door
was
shut
i
will
bring
up
your
breakfast
myself
and
then
you
can
tell
me
the
barbara
flew
after
hare
poured
out
his
coffee
saw
him
settled
at
his
breakfast
with
a
plateful
of
before
him
and
then
returned
upstairs
with
her
mamma
s
tea
and
dry
toast
go
on
with
your
dream
mamma
she
said
but
your
breakfast
will
be
cold
oh
don
t
mind
that
did
you
dream
of
richard
not
very
much
of
richard
except
that
the
old
and
continuous
trouble
of
his
being
away
and
unable
to
return
seemed
to
pervade
it
all
through
you
remember
barbara
richard
asserted
to
us
in
that
short
hidden
night
visit
that
he
did
not
commit
the
murder
that
it
was
another
who
did
yes
i
remember
it
replied
barbara
barbara
i
am
convinced
he
spoke
the
truth
i
trust
him
i
feel
sure
of
it
also
i
asked
him
you
remember
whether
it
was
otway
bethel
who
committed
it
for
i
have
always
doubted
bethel
in
an
indefinite
vague
manner
richard
replied
it
was
not
bethel
but
a
stranger
well
barbara
in
my
dream
i
thought
that
stranger
came
to
west
lynne
that
he
came
to
this
house
here
and
we
were
talking
to
him
of
him
conversing
as
we
might
with
any
other
visitor
mind
you
we
seemed
to
know
that
he
was
the
one
who
actually
did
it
but
he
denied
it
he
wanted
to
put
it
upon
richard
and
i
saw
him
yes
i
did
barbara
whisper
to
otway
bethel
but
oh
i
can
not
tell
you
the
sickening
horror
that
was
upon
me
throughout
and
seemed
to
be
upon
you
also
lest
he
should
make
good
his
own
apparent
innocence
and
crush
richard
his
victim
i
think
the
dread
and
horror
awoke
what
was
he
like
this
stranger
asked
barbara
in
a
low
tone
well
i
can
not
quite
tell
the
recollection
of
his
appearance
seemed
to
pass
away
from
me
with
the
dream
he
was
dressed
as
a
gentleman
and
we
conversed
with
him
as
an
barbara
s
mind
was
full
of
captain
thorn
but
his
name
had
not
been
mentioned
to
hare
and
neither
would
she
mention
it
now
she
fell
into
deep
thought
and
hare
had
to
speak
twice
before
she
could
be
aroused
barbara
i
say
don
t
you
think
this
dream
coming
uncalled
for
uninduced
must
forebode
some
ill
rely
upon
it
something
connected
with
that
wretched
murder
is
going
to
be
stirred
up
you
know
i
do
not
believe
in
dreams
was
barbara
s
answer
i
think
when
people
say
this
dream
is
a
sign
of
such
and
such
a
thing
it
is
the
greatest
absurdity
in
the
world
i
wish
you
could
remember
what
the
man
seemed
like
in
your
i
wish
i
could
answered
hare
breaking
off
a
particle
of
her
dry
toast
all
i
can
remember
is
that
he
appeared
to
be
a
was
he
tall
had
he
black
hair
hare
shook
her
heard
i
tell
you
my
dear
the
remembrance
has
passed
from
me
so
whether
his
hair
was
black
or
light
i
can
not
say
i
think
he
was
tall
but
he
was
sitting
down
and
otway
bethel
stood
behind
his
chair
i
seemed
to
feel
that
richard
was
outside
the
door
in
hiding
trembling
lest
the
man
should
go
out
and
see
him
there
and
i
trembled
too
oh
barbara
it
was
a
distressing
dream
i
wish
you
could
avoid
having
them
mamma
for
they
seem
to
upset
you
very
why
did
you
ask
whether
the
man
was
tall
and
had
black
hair
barbara
returned
an
evasive
answer
it
would
not
do
to
tell
hare
that
her
suspicions
pointed
to
one
particular
quarter
it
would
have
agitated
her
too
greatly
so
vivid
was
the
dream
she
could
scarcely
persuade
herself
when
she
awoke
that
it
was
not
real
and
the
murderer
actually
at
west
lynne
oh
barbara
barbara
she
exclaimed
in
a
wailing
tone
when
will
this
mystery
be
cleared
and
my
own
restored
to
me
seven
years
since
he
stole
here
to
see
us
and
no
tidings
people
say
that
changes
come
every
seven
years
mamma
said
barbara
hopefully
but
i
will
go
down
and
send
you
up
some
more
and
guard
your
countenance
well
returned
her
mother
don
t
let
your
father
suspect
anything
remember
his
oath
to
bring
richard
to
justice
if
he
thought
we
dwelt
on
his
innocence
there
is
no
knowing
what
he
might
do
to
find
him
he
is
so
very
so
very
cruel
and
unnatural
i
call
it
mamma
but
never
fear
my
betraying
anything
but
have
you
heard
about
joyce
no
what
is
it
she
had
a
severe
fall
while
playing
with
little
isabel
and
it
is
said
she
will
be
confined
to
bed
for
several
weeks
i
am
very
sorry
for
and
composing
her
face
she
descended
to
the
the
dinner
hour
at
the
hares
when
they
were
alone
was
four
o
clock
and
it
arrived
that
day
as
usual
and
they
sat
down
to
table
hare
was
better
then
the
sunshine
and
the
business
of
stirring
life
had
in
some
measure
effaced
the
visions
of
the
night
and
restored
her
to
her
wonted
frame
of
mind
the
cloth
removed
the
justice
sat
but
a
little
while
over
his
port
wine
for
he
was
engaged
to
smoke
an
pipe
with
a
brother
magistrate
justice
herbert
shall
you
be
home
to
tea
papa
inquired
barbara
is
it
any
business
of
yours
young
lady
oh
not
in
the
least
answered
miss
barbara
only
if
you
had
been
coming
home
to
tea
i
suppose
we
must
have
waited
had
you
not
been
in
i
thought
you
said
richard
that
you
were
going
to
stay
the
evening
with
herbert
observed
hare
so
i
am
responded
the
justice
but
barbara
has
a
great
liking
for
the
sound
of
her
own
the
justice
departed
striding
pompously
down
the
gravel
walk
barbara
waltzed
round
the
large
room
to
a
gleeful
song
as
if
she
felt
his
absence
a
relief
perhaps
she
did
you
can
have
tea
now
mamma
at
any
time
you
please
if
you
are
thirsty
without
waiting
till
seven
quoth
she
barbara
said
hare
what
mamma
i
am
sorry
to
hear
of
the
calamity
which
has
fallen
upon
joyce
i
should
like
to
walk
to
east
lynne
this
evening
and
inquire
after
her
and
see
her
if
i
may
it
would
be
but
neighborly
i
feel
quite
equal
to
it
since
i
have
accustomed
myself
to
take
more
exercise
i
feel
better
for
it
you
know
and
we
have
not
been
out
poor
joyce
what
time
shall
we
go
barbara
if
we
were
to
get
there
by
by
seven
i
should
think
their
dinner
will
be
over
yes
answered
hare
with
alacrity
who
was
always
pleased
when
somebody
else
decided
for
her
but
i
should
like
some
tea
before
we
start
barbara
took
care
that
her
mamma
should
have
some
tea
and
then
they
proceeded
toward
east
lynne
it
was
a
lovely
evening
the
air
warm
and
the
humming
gnats
sported
in
it
as
if
to
make
the
most
of
the
waning
summer
hare
enjoyed
it
at
first
but
ere
she
reached
east
lynne
she
became
aware
that
the
walk
was
too
much
for
her
she
did
not
usually
venture
upon
half
so
long
a
one
and
probably
the
fever
and
agitation
of
the
morning
had
somewhat
impaired
her
day
s
strength
she
laid
her
hand
upon
the
iron
gate
as
they
turned
into
the
park
and
stood
still
i
did
wrong
to
come
lean
on
me
mamma
when
you
reach
those
benches
you
can
take
a
good
rest
before
proceeding
to
the
house
it
is
very
warm
and
that
may
have
fatigued
they
gained
the
benches
which
were
placed
under
some
of
the
park
trees
in
front
of
the
gates
and
the
road
but
not
of
the
house
and
hare
sat
down
another
minute
and
they
were
surrounded
carlyle
his
wife
and
sister
who
were
taking
an
stroll
amidst
the
flowers
with
their
guest
francis
levison
discerned
them
and
came
up
the
children
except
the
youngest
were
of
the
party
lady
isabel
warmly
welcomed
hare
she
had
become
quite
attached
to
the
delicate
and
suffering
woman
a
pretty
one
i
am
am
i
not
archibald
to
come
inquiring
after
one
invalid
and
am
so
much
of
an
invalid
myself
that
i
have
to
stop
way
hare
exclaimed
as
carlyle
shook
her
hand
i
was
so
greatly
concerned
to
hear
of
poor
you
must
stay
the
evening
now
you
are
here
cried
lady
isabel
it
will
afford
you
a
good
rest
and
tea
will
refresh
oh
thank
you
but
we
have
taken
tea
said
hare
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
take
some
more
she
laughed
indeed
you
seem
too
fatigued
to
be
anything
but
a
prisoner
with
us
for
the
next
hour
or
i
fear
i
am
answered
hare
who
the
dickens
are
they
captain
levison
was
muttering
to
himself
as
he
contemplated
the
guests
from
a
distance
it
s
a
deuced
pretty
girl
whoever
she
may
be
i
think
i
ll
approach
they
don
t
look
he
did
approach
and
the
introduction
was
made
captain
levison
hare
and
miss
a
few
formal
words
and
captain
levison
disappeared
again
challenging
little
william
carlyle
to
a
how
very
poorly
your
mamma
looks
carlyle
exclaimed
to
barbara
when
they
were
beyond
the
hearing
of
hare
who
was
busy
talking
with
lady
isabel
and
miss
carlyle
and
she
has
appeared
so
much
stronger
lately
altogether
the
walk
here
has
fatigued
her
i
feared
it
would
be
too
long
so
that
she
looks
unusually
pale
replied
barbara
but
what
do
you
think
it
is
that
has
upset
her
again
carlyle
he
turned
his
inquiring
eyes
upon
barbara
papa
came
downstairs
this
morning
saying
mamma
was
ill
that
she
had
one
of
her
old
attacks
of
fever
and
restlessness
i
declare
as
papa
spoke
i
thought
to
myself
could
mamma
have
been
dreaming
some
foolish
dream
again
for
you
remember
how
ill
she
used
to
be
after
them
i
ran
upstairs
and
the
first
thing
that
mamma
said
to
me
was
that
she
had
had
one
of
those
dreadful
i
fancied
she
must
have
outlived
her
fear
of
them
that
her
own
plain
sense
had
come
to
her
aid
long
ago
showing
her
how
futile
dreams
are
meaning
nothing
even
if
hers
do
occasionally
touch
upon
that
that
unhappy
you
may
just
as
well
reason
with
a
post
as
reason
with
mamma
when
she
is
suffering
from
the
influence
of
one
of
those
dreams
returned
barbara
i
tried
it
this
morning
i
asked
her
to
call
up
as
you
observe
good
sense
to
her
aid
and
her
reply
was
how
could
she
help
her
feelings
she
did
not
induce
the
dream
by
thinking
of
richard
or
in
any
other
way
and
yet
it
came
and
shattered
of
course
so
far
mamma
is
right
for
she
can
not
help
the
dreams
carlyle
made
no
immediate
reply
he
picked
up
a
ball
belonging
to
one
of
the
children
which
lay
in
his
path
and
began
tossing
it
gently
in
his
hand
it
is
a
singular
thing
he
observed
presently
that
we
do
not
hear
from
oh
very
very
and
i
know
mamma
distresses
over
it
a
few
words
which
she
let
fall
this
morning
betrayed
it
plainly
i
am
no
believer
in
dreams
continued
barbara
but
i
can
not
deny
that
these
which
take
such
a
hold
upon
mamma
do
bear
upon
the
case
in
a
curious
manner
the
one
she
had
last
night
what
was
it
asked
carlyle
she
dreamed
that
the
real
murderer
was
at
west
lynne
she
thought
he
was
at
our
house
as
a
visitor
she
said
or
like
one
making
a
morning
call
and
we
she
and
i
were
conversing
with
him
about
the
murder
he
wanted
to
deny
it
to
put
it
on
richard
and
he
turned
and
whispered
to
otway
bethel
who
stood
behind
his
chair
this
is
another
strange
thing
added
barbara
lifting
her
blue
eyes
in
their
deep
earnestness
to
the
face
of
carlyle
what
is
strange
you
speak
in
enigmas
i
mean
that
otway
bethel
should
invariably
appear
in
her
dreams
until
that
stolen
visit
of
richard
s
we
had
no
idea
he
was
near
the
spot
at
the
time
and
yet
he
had
always
made
a
prominent
feature
in
these
and
who
was
the
murderer
in
your
mamma
s
dream
continued
carlyle
speaking
as
gravely
as
though
he
were
upon
a
subject
that
men
ridicule
not
she
can
not
remember
except
that
he
seemed
a
gentleman
and
that
we
held
intercourse
with
him
as
such
now
that
again
is
remarkable
we
never
told
her
you
know
of
our
suspicions
of
captain
i
think
you
must
be
becoming
a
convert
to
the
theory
of
dreams
yourself
barbara
you
are
so
very
earnest
smiled
carlyle
no
not
to
dreams
but
i
am
earnest
for
my
dear
brother
richard
s
that
thorn
does
not
appear
in
a
hurry
again
to
favor
west
lynne
with
his
carlyle
paused
for
barbara
had
hurriedly
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
with
a
warning
gesture
in
talking
they
had
wandered
across
the
park
to
its
ornamental
grounds
and
were
now
in
a
quiet
path
overshadowed
on
the
other
side
by
a
chain
of
imitation
rocks
seated
astride
on
the
summit
of
these
rocks
right
above
where
carlyle
and
barbara
were
standing
was
francis
levison
his
face
was
turned
from
them
and
he
appeared
intent
upon
a
child
s
whip
winding
leather
round
its
handle
whether
he
heard
their
footsteps
or
not
he
did
not
turn
they
quickened
their
pace
and
quitted
the
walk
bending
their
steps
backward
toward
the
group
of
ladies
could
he
have
heard
what
we
were
saying
ejaculated
barbara
below
her
breath
carlyle
looked
down
upon
the
concerned
flushed
cheeks
with
a
smile
barbara
was
so
evidently
perturbed
but
for
a
certain
episode
of
their
lives
some
years
ago
he
might
have
soothed
her
tenderly
i
think
he
must
have
heard
a
little
barbara
unless
his
wits
were
he
might
not
be
attending
what
if
he
did
hear
it
is
of
no
i
was
speaking
you
know
of
captain
thorn
of
his
being
the
you
were
not
speaking
of
richard
or
his
movements
so
never
mind
levison
is
a
stranger
to
the
whole
it
is
nothing
to
him
if
he
did
hear
the
name
of
thorn
mentioned
or
even
distinguished
the
subject
it
would
bear
for
him
no
interest
would
go
as
the
saying
runs
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
be
at
rest
he
really
did
look
somewhat
tenderly
upon
her
as
he
spoke
and
they
were
near
enough
to
lady
isabel
for
her
to
note
the
glance
she
need
not
have
been
jealous
it
bore
no
treachery
to
her
but
she
did
note
it
she
had
noted
also
their
wandering
away
together
and
she
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
premeditated
that
they
had
gone
beyond
her
sight
to
enjoy
each
other
s
society
for
a
few
stolen
moments
wonderfully
attractive
looked
barbara
that
evening
for
carlyle
or
any
one
else
to
steal
away
with
her
tasty
elegant
airy
summer
attire
her
bright
blue
eyes
her
charming
features
and
her
damask
cheeks
she
had
untied
the
strings
of
her
pretty
white
bonnet
and
was
restlessly
playing
with
them
more
in
thought
than
nervousness
barbara
love
how
are
we
to
get
home
asked
hare
i
do
fear
i
shall
never
walk
it
i
wish
i
had
told
benjamin
to
bring
the
i
can
send
to
him
said
carlyle
but
it
is
too
bad
of
me
archibald
to
take
you
and
lady
isabel
by
storm
in
this
unceremonious
manner
and
to
give
your
servants
trouble
a
great
deal
too
bad
i
think
returned
carlyle
with
mock
gravity
as
to
the
servants
the
one
who
has
to
go
will
never
get
over
the
trouble
depend
upon
it
you
always
were
more
concerned
for
others
than
for
yourself
dear
and
you
were
always
kind
archibald
smoothing
difficulties
for
all
and
making
a
trouble
of
nothing
ah
lady
isabel
were
i
a
young
woman
i
should
be
envying
you
your
good
husband
there
are
not
many
like
possibly
the
sentence
reminded
lady
isabel
that
another
who
was
young
might
be
envying
her
for
her
cheeks
isabel
s
flushed
crimson
carlyle
held
out
his
strong
arm
of
help
to
hare
if
sufficiently
rested
i
fancy
you
would
be
more
comfortable
on
a
sofa
indoors
allow
me
to
support
you
and
you
can
take
my
arm
on
the
other
side
cried
miss
carlyle
placing
her
tall
form
by
hare
between
us
both
we
will
pull
you
bravely
along
your
feet
need
scarcely
touch
the
hare
laughed
but
said
she
thought
carlyle
s
arm
would
be
sufficient
she
took
it
and
they
were
turning
toward
the
house
when
her
eye
caught
the
form
of
a
gentleman
passing
along
the
road
by
the
park
gate
barbara
run
she
hurriedly
exclaimed
there
s
tom
herbert
going
toward
our
house
and
he
will
just
call
in
and
tell
them
to
send
the
phaeton
if
you
ask
him
which
will
save
the
trouble
to
carlyle
s
servants
of
going
expressly
make
haste
child
you
will
be
up
with
him
in
half
a
barbara
thus
urged
set
off
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
toward
the
gates
before
the
rest
of
the
party
well
knew
what
was
being
done
it
was
too
late
for
carlyle
to
stop
her
and
repeat
that
the
servant
should
go
for
barbara
was
already
up
with
tom
herbert
the
latter
had
seen
her
running
toward
him
and
waited
at
the
gate
are
you
going
past
our
house
inquired
barbara
perceiving
then
that
otway
bethel
also
stood
there
but
just
beyond
the
view
of
the
women
yes
why
replied
tom
herbert
who
was
not
famed
for
his
politeness
being
blunt
by
nature
and
fast
by
habit
mamma
would
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
just
call
in
and
leave
word
that
benjamin
is
to
bring
up
the
phaeton
mamma
walked
here
intending
to
walk
home
but
she
finds
herself
so
fatigued
as
to
be
unequal
to
all
right
i
ll
call
and
send
him
what
time
nothing
had
been
said
to
barbara
about
the
time
so
she
was
at
liberty
to
name
her
own
ten
o
clock
we
shall
be
home
then
before
that
you
will
responded
tom
herbert
he
and
the
governor
and
two
or
three
more
old
codgers
are
blowing
clouds
till
you
can
t
see
across
the
room
and
they
are
sure
to
get
at
it
after
supper
i
say
miss
barbara
are
you
engaged
for
a
few
picnics
good
for
a
great
many
returned
barbara
our
girls
want
to
get
up
some
in
the
next
week
or
two
jack
s
home
you
is
he
said
barbara
in
surprise
we
had
a
letter
yesterday
and
he
came
a
brother
officer
with
him
jack
vows
if
the
girls
don
t
cater
well
for
them
in
the
way
of
amusement
he
ll
never
honor
them
by
spending
his
leave
at
home
again
so
mind
you
keep
yourself
in
readiness
for
any
fun
that
may
turn
up
good
good
evening
miss
hare
added
otway
bethel
as
barbara
was
returning
the
salutation
she
became
conscious
of
other
footsteps
advancing
from
the
same
direction
that
they
had
come
and
moved
her
head
hastily
round
two
gentlemen
walking
were
close
upon
her
in
one
of
whom
she
recognized
jack
otherwise
major
herbert
he
stopped
and
held
out
his
hand
it
is
some
years
since
we
met
but
i
have
not
forgotten
the
pretty
face
of
miss
barbara
he
cried
a
young
girl
s
face
it
was
then
but
it
is
a
stately
young
lady
s
barbara
laughed
your
brother
has
just
told
me
you
had
arrived
at
west
lynne
but
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
close
to
me
he
has
been
asking
me
if
i
am
ready
for
some
pic
barbara
s
voice
faltered
and
the
rushing
crimson
dyed
her
face
whose
face
was
that
who
was
he
standing
opposite
to
her
side
by
side
with
john
herbert
she
had
seen
the
face
but
once
yet
it
had
implanted
itself
upon
her
memory
in
characters
of
fire
major
herbert
continued
to
talk
but
barbara
for
once
lost
her
she
could
not
listen
she
could
only
stare
at
that
face
as
if
fascinated
to
the
gaze
looking
herself
something
like
a
simpleton
her
shy
blue
eyes
anxious
and
restless
and
her
lips
turning
to
an
ashy
whiteness
a
strange
feeling
of
wonder
of
superstition
was
creeping
over
barbara
was
that
man
behind
her
in
sober
veritable
reality
or
was
it
but
a
phantom
called
up
in
her
mind
by
the
associations
rising
from
her
mamma
s
dream
or
by
the
conversation
held
not
many
moments
ago
with
carlyle
major
herbert
may
have
deemed
that
barbara
who
evidently
could
not
attend
to
himself
but
was
attending
to
his
companion
wished
for
an
introduction
and
he
accordingly
made
it
captain
thorn
miss
then
barbara
roused
herself
her
senses
were
partially
coming
to
her
and
she
became
alive
to
the
fact
that
they
must
deem
her
behavior
unorthodox
for
a
young
lady
i
i
looked
at
captain
thorn
for
i
thought
i
remembered
his
face
she
stammered
i
was
in
west
lynne
for
a
day
or
two
some
five
years
ago
he
observed
ah
yes
returned
barbara
are
you
going
to
make
a
long
stay
now
we
have
several
weeks
leave
of
absence
whether
we
shall
remain
here
all
the
time
i
can
not
barbara
parted
from
them
thought
upon
thought
crowded
upon
her
brain
as
she
flew
back
to
east
lynne
she
ran
up
the
steps
to
the
hall
gliding
toward
a
group
which
stood
near
its
further
end
her
mother
miss
carlyle
carlyle
and
little
isabel
lady
isabel
she
did
not
see
hare
was
then
going
up
to
see
joyce
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
she
stealthily
touched
carlyle
and
he
stepped
away
from
the
rest
to
speak
to
her
she
drawing
back
toward
the
door
of
one
of
the
reception
rooms
and
motioning
him
to
approach
oh
archibald
i
must
speak
to
you
alone
could
you
not
come
out
again
for
a
little
while
he
nodded
and
walked
out
openly
by
her
side
why
should
he
not
what
had
he
to
conceal
but
unfortunately
lady
isabel
who
had
but
gone
into
that
same
room
for
a
minute
and
was
coming
out
again
to
join
hare
both
saw
barbara
s
touch
upon
her
husband
s
arm
marked
her
agitation
and
heard
her
words
she
went
to
one
of
the
hall
windows
and
watched
them
saunter
toward
the
more
private
part
of
the
ground
she
saw
her
husband
send
back
isabel
never
since
her
marriage
had
lady
isabel
s
jealousy
been
excited
as
it
was
excited
that
evening
i
i
feel
i
scarcely
know
whether
i
am
awake
or
dreaming
began
barbara
putting
up
her
hand
to
her
brow
and
speaking
in
a
dreamy
tone
pardon
me
for
bringing
you
out
in
this
unceremonious
what
state
secrets
have
you
to
discuss
asked
carlyle
in
a
jesting
manner
we
were
speaking
of
mamma
s
dream
she
said
the
impression
it
had
left
upon
her
mind
that
the
murderer
was
in
west
lynne
was
so
vivid
that
in
spite
of
common
sense
she
could
not
persuade
herself
that
he
was
not
well
just
now
barbara
what
can
be
the
matter
uttered
carlyle
perceiving
that
her
agitation
was
so
great
as
to
impede
her
words
i
have
just
seen
him
she
rejoined
seen
him
echoed
carlyle
looking
at
her
fixedly
a
doubt
crossing
his
mind
whether
barbara
s
mind
might
be
as
uncollected
as
her
manner
what
were
nearly
my
last
words
to
you
that
if
ever
that
thorn
did
come
to
west
lynne
again
i
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
bring
it
home
to
him
he
is
here
archibald
now
when
i
went
to
the
gate
to
speak
to
tom
herbert
his
brother
major
herbert
was
also
there
and
with
him
captain
thorn
bethel
also
do
you
wonder
i
say
that
i
know
not
whether
i
am
awake
or
dreaming
they
have
some
weeks
holiday
and
are
here
to
spend
it
is
a
singular
coincidence
exclaimed
carlyle
had
anything
been
wanting
to
convince
me
that
thorn
is
the
guilty
man
this
would
have
done
it
went
on
barbara
in
her
excitement
mamma
s
dream
with
the
steadfast
impression
it
left
upon
her
that
hallijohn
s
murderer
was
now
at
west
lynne
in
turning
the
sharp
corner
of
the
covered
walk
they
came
in
contact
with
captain
levison
who
appeared
to
be
either
standing
or
sauntering
there
his
hands
underneath
his
again
barbara
felt
vexed
wondering
how
much
he
had
heard
and
beginning
in
her
heart
to
dislike
the
man
he
accosted
them
familiarly
and
appeared
as
if
he
would
have
turned
with
them
but
none
could
put
down
presumption
more
effectually
than
carlyle
calm
and
gentlemanly
though
he
always
was
i
will
join
you
presently
captain
levison
he
said
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
he
turned
back
with
barbara
toward
the
open
parts
of
the
park
do
you
like
that
captain
levison
she
abruptly
inquired
when
they
were
beyond
hearing
i
can
not
say
i
do
was
carlyle
s
reply
he
is
one
who
does
not
improve
upon
to
me
it
looks
as
though
he
had
placed
himself
in
our
way
to
hear
what
we
were
no
no
barbara
what
interest
could
it
bear
for
him
barbara
did
not
contest
the
point
she
turned
to
the
one
nearer
at
heart
what
must
be
our
course
with
regard
to
thorn
it
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
replied
carlyle
i
can
not
go
up
to
the
man
and
unceremoniously
accuse
him
of
being
hallijohn
s
they
took
their
way
to
the
house
for
there
was
nothing
further
to
discuss
captain
levison
entered
it
before
them
and
saw
lady
isabel
standing
at
the
hall
window
yes
she
was
standing
and
looking
still
brooding
over
her
fancied
wrongs
who
is
that
miss
hare
he
demanded
in
a
cynical
tone
they
appear
to
have
a
pretty
good
understanding
together
twice
this
evening
i
have
met
them
enjoying
a
private
walk
and
a
private
what
did
you
say
sharply
and
haughtily
returned
lady
isabel
nay
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
was
the
answer
for
he
knew
that
she
heard
his
words
distinctly
in
spite
of
her
question
i
spoke
of
monsieur
votre
chapter
xxiii
captain
thorn
in
trouble
about
a
in
talking
over
a
bygone
misfortune
we
sometimes
make
the
remark
or
hear
it
made
to
us
circumstances
worked
against
such
and
such
a
thing
might
have
turned
out
differently
we
say
had
the
surrounding
circumstances
been
more
favorable
but
they
were
in
opposition
they
were
dead
against
it
now
if
ever
attendant
circumstances
can
be
said
to
have
borne
a
baneful
influence
upon
any
person
in
this
world
they
most
assuredly
did
at
this
present
time
against
lady
isabel
carlyle
coeval
you
see
with
the
arrival
of
the
levison
at
east
lynne
all
the
jealous
feeling
touching
her
husband
and
barbara
hare
was
renewed
and
with
greater
force
than
ever
barbara
painfully
anxious
that
something
should
be
brought
to
light
it
would
have
puzzled
her
to
say
how
or
by
what
means
by
which
her
brother
should
be
exonerated
from
the
terrible
charge
under
which
he
lay
fully
believing
that
frederick
thorn
captain
in
her
majesty
s
service
was
the
man
who
had
committed
the
crime
as
asserted
by
richard
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
bordering
upon
frenzy
too
keenly
she
felt
the
truth
of
her
own
words
that
she
was
powerless
that
she
could
herself
do
nothing
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
after
a
night
passed
in
troubled
reflection
more
than
in
sleep
her
thoughts
were
oh
that
i
could
this
day
find
out
something
certain
she
was
often
at
the
herberts
frequently
invited
there
sometimes
going
uninvited
she
and
the
herberts
were
intimate
and
they
pressed
barbara
into
all
the
impromptu
gay
doings
now
their
brother
was
at
home
there
she
of
course
saw
captain
thorn
and
now
and
then
she
was
enabled
to
pick
up
scraps
of
his
past
history
eagerly
were
these
scraps
carried
to
carlyle
not
at
his
office
barbara
would
not
appear
there
perhaps
she
was
afraid
of
the
gossiping
tongues
of
west
lynne
or
that
her
visits
might
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
that
stern
prying
and
questioning
old
gentleman
whom
she
called
sire
it
may
be
too
that
she
feared
if
seen
haunting
carlyle
s
office
captain
thorn
might
come
to
hear
of
it
and
suspect
the
agitation
that
was
afloat
for
who
could
know
better
than
he
the
guilt
that
was
falsely
attaching
to
richard
therefore
she
chose
rather
to
go
to
east
lynne
or
to
waylay
carlyle
as
he
passed
to
and
from
business
it
was
little
she
gathered
to
tell
him
one
evening
she
met
him
with
the
news
that
thorn
had
been
in
former
years
at
west
lynne
though
she
could
not
fix
the
date
another
time
she
went
boldly
to
east
lynne
in
eager
anxiety
ostensibly
to
make
a
call
on
lady
isabel
and
a
very
restless
one
it
was
contriving
to
make
carlyle
understand
that
she
wanted
to
see
him
alone
he
went
out
with
her
when
she
departed
and
accompanied
her
as
far
as
the
park
gates
the
two
evidently
absorbed
in
earnest
converse
lady
isabel
s
jealous
eye
saw
that
the
communication
barbara
had
to
make
was
that
captain
thorn
had
let
fall
the
avowal
that
he
had
once
been
in
trouble
though
of
its
nature
there
was
no
indication
given
another
journey
of
hers
took
the
scrap
of
news
that
she
had
discovered
he
knew
swainson
well
part
of
this
nay
perhaps
the
whole
of
it
carlyle
had
found
out
for
himself
nevertheless
he
always
received
barbara
with
vivid
interest
richard
hare
was
related
to
miss
carlyle
and
if
his
innocence
could
be
made
clear
in
the
sight
of
men
it
would
be
little
less
gratifying
to
them
than
to
the
hares
of
richard
s
innocence
carlyle
now
entertained
little
if
any
doubt
and
he
was
becoming
impressed
with
the
guilt
of
captain
thorn
the
latter
spoke
mysteriously
of
a
portion
of
his
past
life
when
he
could
be
brought
to
speak
of
it
at
all
and
he
bore
evidently
some
secret
that
he
did
not
care
to
have
alluded
to
but
now
look
at
the
mean
treachery
of
that
man
francis
levison
the
few
meetings
that
lady
isabel
did
witness
between
her
husband
and
barbara
would
have
been
quite
enough
to
excite
her
anger
and
jealousy
to
trouble
her
peace
but
in
addition
francis
levison
took
care
to
tell
her
of
those
she
did
not
see
it
pleased
him
he
could
best
tell
with
what
motive
to
watch
the
movements
of
carlyle
and
barbara
there
was
a
hedge
pathway
through
the
fields
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
to
the
residence
of
justice
hare
and
as
carlyle
walked
down
the
road
to
business
in
his
unsuspicion
not
one
time
in
fifty
did
he
choose
to
ride
the
walk
to
and
fro
kept
him
in
health
he
said
captain
levison
would
be
strolling
down
like
a
serpent
behind
the
hedge
watching
all
his
movements
watching
his
interviews
with
barbara
did
any
take
place
watching
carlyle
turn
into
the
grove
as
he
sometimes
did
and
perhaps
watch
barbara
run
out
of
the
house
to
meet
him
it
was
all
related
over
and
with
miserable
exaggeration
to
lady
isabel
whose
jealousy
as
a
natural
sequence
grew
feverish
in
its
extent
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
explain
that
of
this
feeling
of
lady
isabel
s
barbara
knew
nothing
not
a
shadow
of
suspicion
had
ever
penetrated
to
her
mind
that
lady
isabel
was
jealous
of
her
had
she
been
told
that
such
was
the
fact
she
would
have
laughed
in
derision
at
her
informant
carlyle
s
happy
wife
proudly
secure
in
her
position
and
in
his
affection
jealous
of
her
of
her
to
whom
he
had
never
given
an
admiring
look
or
a
loving
word
it
would
have
taken
a
great
deal
to
make
barbara
believe
that
how
different
were
the
facts
in
reality
these
meetings
of
carlyle
s
and
barbara
s
instead
of
episodes
of
and
tender
speeches
were
positively
painful
especially
to
barbara
from
the
unhappy
nature
of
the
subject
to
be
discussed
far
from
feeling
a
reprehensible
pleasure
at
seeking
the
meetings
with
carlyle
barbara
shrank
from
them
but
that
she
was
urged
by
dire
necessity
in
the
interests
of
richard
she
would
wholly
have
avoided
such
poor
barbara
in
spite
of
that
explosion
of
excitement
years
back
was
a
lady
possessed
of
a
lady
s
ideas
and
feelings
and
remembering
the
explosion
it
did
not
accord
with
her
pride
at
all
to
be
pushing
herself
into
what
might
be
called
secret
meetings
with
archibald
carlyle
but
barbara
in
her
sisterly
love
pressed
down
all
thought
of
self
and
went
perseveringly
forward
for
richard
s
sake
carlyle
was
seated
one
morning
in
his
private
room
at
his
office
when
his
head
clerk
dill
came
in
a
gentleman
is
asking
to
see
you
i
am
too
busy
to
see
anybody
for
this
hour
to
come
you
know
that
so
i
told
him
sir
and
he
says
he
ll
wait
it
is
that
captain
thorn
who
is
staying
here
with
john
carlyle
raised
his
eyes
and
they
encountered
those
of
the
old
man
a
peculiar
expression
was
in
the
face
of
both
carlyle
glanced
down
at
the
parchment
he
was
perusing
as
if
calculating
his
time
then
he
looked
up
again
and
spoke
i
will
see
him
dill
send
him
the
business
leading
to
the
visit
was
quite
simple
captain
frederick
thorn
had
got
himself
into
some
trouble
and
vexation
about
a
bill
as
too
many
captains
will
do
and
he
had
come
to
crave
advice
of
carlyle
carlyle
felt
dubious
about
giving
it
this
captain
thorn
was
a
pleasant
attractive
sort
of
a
man
who
won
much
on
acquaintance
one
whom
carlyle
would
have
been
pleased
in
a
friendly
point
of
view
and
setting
professional
interest
apart
to
help
out
of
his
difficulties
but
if
he
were
the
villain
they
suspected
him
to
be
the
man
with
crime
upon
his
hand
then
carlyle
would
have
ordered
his
office
door
held
wide
for
him
to
slink
out
of
it
can
not
you
advise
me
what
my
course
ought
to
be
he
inquired
detecting
carlyle
s
hesitation
i
could
advise
you
certainly
but
you
must
excuse
my
being
plain
captain
thorn
i
like
to
know
who
my
clients
are
before
i
take
up
their
cause
or
accept
them
as
i
am
able
to
pay
you
was
captain
thorn
s
reply
i
am
not
short
of
ready
money
only
this
bill
carlyle
laughed
out
after
having
bit
his
lip
with
annoyance
it
was
a
natural
inference
of
yours
he
said
but
i
assure
you
i
was
not
thinking
of
your
purse
or
my
pocket
my
father
held
it
right
never
to
undertake
business
for
a
stranger
unless
a
man
was
good
in
a
respectable
point
of
view
and
his
cause
was
good
he
did
not
mention
it
and
i
have
acted
on
the
same
principle
by
these
means
the
position
and
character
of
our
business
is
rarely
attained
by
a
solicitor
now
in
saying
that
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
i
am
not
casting
any
doubt
upon
you
captain
thorn
i
am
merely
upholding
my
common
my
family
is
well
connected
was
captain
thorn
s
next
venture
excuse
me
family
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
the
poorest
day
laborer
if
a
pauper
out
of
the
workhouse
came
to
me
for
advice
he
should
be
heartily
welcome
to
it
provided
he
were
an
honest
man
in
the
face
of
the
day
again
i
repeat
you
must
take
no
offence
at
what
i
say
for
i
cast
no
reflection
on
you
i
only
urge
that
you
and
your
character
are
unknown
to
curious
words
from
a
lawyer
to
a
and
captain
thorn
found
them
so
but
carlyle
s
tone
was
so
courteous
his
manner
so
affable
in
fact
he
was
so
thoroughly
the
gentleman
that
it
was
impossible
to
feel
hurt
well
how
can
i
convince
you
that
i
am
respectable
i
have
served
my
country
ever
since
i
was
sixteen
and
my
brother
officers
have
found
no
cause
of
complaint
any
position
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
would
be
generally
deemed
a
sufficient
guarantee
inquire
of
john
herbert
the
herberts
too
are
friends
of
yours
and
they
have
not
disdained
to
give
me
room
amidst
their
true
returned
carlyle
feeling
that
he
could
not
well
object
further
and
also
that
all
men
should
be
deemed
innocent
until
proved
guilty
at
any
rate
i
will
advise
you
what
must
be
done
at
present
he
added
though
if
the
affair
is
one
that
must
go
on
i
do
not
promise
that
i
can
continue
to
act
for
you
i
am
very
busy
just
captain
thorn
explained
his
dilemma
and
carlyle
told
him
what
to
do
in
it
were
you
not
at
west
lynne
some
ten
years
ago
he
suddenly
inquired
at
the
close
of
the
conversation
you
denied
it
to
me
once
at
my
house
but
i
concluded
from
an
observation
you
let
fall
that
you
had
been
yes
i
was
replied
captain
thorn
in
a
confidential
tone
i
don
t
mind
owning
it
to
you
in
confidence
but
i
do
not
wish
it
to
get
abroad
i
was
not
at
west
lynne
but
in
its
neighborhood
the
fact
is
when
i
was
a
careless
young
fellow
i
was
stopping
a
few
miles
from
here
and
got
into
a
scrape
through
a
a
in
short
it
was
an
affair
of
gallantry
i
did
not
show
out
very
well
at
the
time
and
i
don
t
care
that
it
should
be
known
in
the
country
carlyle
s
pulse
for
richard
hare
s
sake
beat
a
shade
quicker
the
avowal
of
an
affair
of
gallantry
was
almost
a
confirmation
of
his
suspicions
yes
he
pointedly
said
the
girl
was
afy
afy
who
repeated
captain
thorn
opening
his
eyes
and
fixing
them
on
carlyle
s
afy
captain
thorn
continued
to
look
at
carlyle
an
amused
expression
rather
than
any
other
predominant
on
his
features
you
are
mistaken
he
observed
afy
hallijohn
i
never
heard
the
name
before
in
my
did
you
ever
hear
or
know
that
a
dreadful
tragedy
was
enacted
in
this
place
about
that
period
replied
carlyle
in
a
low
meaning
tone
that
afy
hallijohn
s
father
was
oh
stay
stay
stay
hastily
interrupted
captain
thorn
i
am
telling
a
story
in
saying
i
never
heard
her
name
afy
hallijohn
why
that
s
the
girl
tom
herbert
was
telling
me
about
who
what
was
it
disappeared
after
her
father
was
murdered
in
his
own
cottage
almost
in
afy
s
presence
murdered
by
carlyle
recollected
himself
he
had
spoken
more
impulsively
than
was
his
custom
hallijohn
was
my
father
s
faithful
clerk
for
many
years
he
more
calmly
concluded
and
he
who
committed
the
murder
was
young
hare
son
of
justice
hare
and
brother
to
that
attractive
girl
barbara
your
speaking
of
this
has
recalled
what
they
told
me
to
my
recollection
the
first
evening
i
was
at
the
herberts
justice
hare
was
there
smoking
half
a
dozen
pipes
there
were
going
at
once
i
also
saw
miss
barbara
that
evening
at
your
park
gates
and
tom
told
me
of
the
murder
an
awful
calamity
for
the
hares
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
the
young
lady
is
miss
hare
still
one
with
her
good
fortune
and
good
looks
ought
to
have
changed
her
name
ere
no
it
is
not
the
reason
returned
carlyle
what
is
the
reason
then
a
faint
flush
tinged
the
brow
of
carlyle
i
know
more
than
one
who
would
be
glad
to
get
barbara
in
spite
of
the
murder
do
not
depreciate
miss
not
i
indeed
i
like
the
young
lady
too
well
replied
captain
thorn
the
girl
afy
has
never
been
heard
of
since
has
she
never
said
carlyle
do
you
know
her
well
he
deliberately
added
i
never
knew
her
at
all
if
you
mean
afy
hallijohn
why
should
you
think
i
did
i
never
heard
of
her
till
tom
herbert
amused
me
with
the
carlyle
most
devoutly
wished
he
could
tell
whether
the
man
before
him
was
speaking
the
truth
or
falsehood
he
continued
afy
s
favors
i
speak
in
no
invidious
sense
i
mean
her
smiles
and
chatter
were
pretty
freely
dispersed
for
she
was
heedless
and
vain
amidst
others
who
got
the
credit
for
occasional
basking
in
her
rays
was
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
thorn
was
it
not
yourself
captain
thorn
stroked
his
moustache
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
he
could
boast
of
his
share
of
such
baskings
in
short
as
if
he
felt
half
inclined
to
do
it
upon
my
word
he
simpered
you
do
me
too
much
honor
i
can
not
confess
to
having
been
favored
by
miss
then
she
was
not
the
the
damsel
you
speak
of
who
drove
you
if
i
understand
aright
from
the
locality
resumed
carlyle
fixing
his
eyes
upon
him
so
as
to
take
in
every
tone
of
the
answer
and
shade
of
countenance
as
he
gave
it
i
should
think
not
indeed
it
was
a
married
lady
more
s
the
pity
young
pretty
vain
and
heedless
as
you
represent
this
afy
things
went
smoother
after
a
time
and
she
and
her
husband
a
stupid
country
reconciled
but
i
have
been
ashamed
of
it
since
i
have
grown
wiser
and
i
do
not
care
ever
to
be
recognized
as
the
actor
in
it
or
to
have
it
raked
up
against
captain
thorn
rose
and
took
a
somewhat
hasty
leave
was
he
or
was
he
not
the
man
carlyle
could
not
solve
the
doubt
dill
came
in
as
he
disappeared
closed
the
door
and
advanced
to
his
master
speaking
in
an
under
tone
mr
archibald
has
it
struck
you
that
the
gentleman
just
gone
out
may
be
the
lieutenant
thorn
you
once
spoke
to
me
about
he
who
had
used
to
gallop
over
from
swainson
to
court
afy
hallijohn
it
has
struck
me
so
most
forcibly
replied
carlyle
dill
i
would
give
five
hundred
pounds
out
of
my
pocket
this
moment
to
be
assured
of
the
fact
if
he
is
the
i
have
seen
him
several
times
since
he
has
been
staying
with
the
herberts
pursued
the
old
gentleman
and
my
doubts
have
naturally
been
excited
as
to
whether
it
could
be
the
man
in
question
curious
enough
bezant
the
doctor
was
over
here
yesterday
from
swainson
and
as
i
was
walking
with
him
we
met
captain
thorn
the
two
recognized
each
other
and
bowed
merely
as
distant
acquaintances
do
you
know
that
gentleman
said
i
to
bezant
yes
he
answered
it
is
mr
frederick
with
something
added
on
to
it
said
i
his
name
is
i
know
that
returned
bezant
but
when
he
was
in
swainson
some
years
ago
he
chose
to
drop
the
thorn
and
the
town
in
general
knew
him
only
as
what
was
he
doing
there
bezant
i
asked
amusing
himself
and
getting
into
mischief
was
the
answer
nothing
very
bad
only
the
random
scrapes
of
young
was
he
often
on
horseback
riding
to
a
distance
was
my
next
question
yes
that
he
was
replied
bezant
none
more
fond
of
galloping
across
the
country
than
he
i
used
to
tell
him
he
d
ride
his
horse
s
tail
now
archibald
what
do
you
think
concluded
the
old
clerk
and
so
far
as
i
could
make
out
this
was
about
the
very
time
of
the
tragedy
at
hallijohn
think
replied
carlyle
what
can
i
think
but
that
it
is
the
same
man
i
am
convinced
of
it
and
leaning
back
into
his
chair
he
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
regardless
of
the
parchments
that
lay
before
him
the
weeks
went
on
two
or
three
and
things
seemed
to
be
progressing
backward
rather
than
forward
if
that
s
not
irish
francis
levison
s
affairs
that
is
the
adjustment
of
them
did
not
advance
at
all
another
thing
that
may
be
said
to
be
progressing
backward
for
it
was
going
on
fast
to
bad
instead
of
good
was
the
jealousy
of
lady
isabel
how
could
it
be
otherwise
kept
up
as
it
was
by
barbara
s
frequent
meetings
with
carlyle
and
by
captain
levison
s
exaggerated
whispers
of
them
discontented
ill
at
ease
with
herself
and
with
everybody
about
her
isabel
was
living
now
in
a
state
of
excitement
a
dangerous
resentment
against
her
husband
beginning
to
rise
up
in
her
heart
that
very
day
the
one
of
captain
levison
s
visit
to
levison
park
in
driving
through
west
lynne
in
the
pony
carriage
she
had
come
upon
her
husband
in
close
converse
with
barbara
hare
so
absorbed
were
they
that
they
never
saw
her
though
her
carriage
passed
close
to
the
pavement
where
they
stood
on
the
morning
following
this
as
the
hare
family
were
seated
at
breakfast
the
postman
was
observed
coming
toward
the
house
barbara
sprang
from
her
seat
to
the
open
window
and
the
man
advanced
to
her
only
one
miss
it
is
for
who
is
it
from
began
the
justice
as
barbara
returned
to
her
chair
in
letters
as
in
other
things
he
was
always
curious
to
know
their
contents
whether
they
might
be
addressed
to
himself
or
not
it
is
from
anne
papa
replied
barbara
as
she
laid
the
letter
by
her
side
on
the
table
why
don
t
you
open
it
and
see
what
she
says
i
will
directly
i
am
just
going
to
pour
out
some
more
tea
for
finally
the
justice
finished
his
breakfast
and
strolled
out
into
the
garden
barbara
opened
her
letter
hare
watched
her
movements
and
her
countenance
she
saw
the
latter
flush
suddenly
and
vividly
and
then
become
deadly
pale
she
saw
barbara
crush
the
note
in
her
hand
when
read
oh
mamma
she
uttered
the
flush
of
emotion
came
also
into
hare
s
delicate
cheeks
barbara
is
it
bad
news
mamma
it
it
is
about
richard
she
whispered
glancing
at
the
door
and
window
to
see
that
none
might
be
within
sight
or
hearing
i
never
thought
of
him
i
only
fancied
anne
might
be
sending
me
some
bit
of
news
concerning
her
own
affairs
good
heavens
how
fortunate
how
providential
that
papa
did
not
see
the
paper
fall
and
that
you
did
not
persist
in
your
inquiries
if
he
barbara
you
are
keeping
me
in
suspense
interrupted
hare
who
had
also
grown
white
what
should
anne
know
about
richard
barbara
smoothed
out
the
writing
and
held
it
before
her
mother
it
was
as
follows
i
have
had
a
curious
note
from
it
was
without
date
or
signature
but
i
knew
his
handwriting
he
tells
me
to
let
you
know
in
the
most
sure
and
private
manner
that
i
can
that
he
will
soon
be
paying
another
night
visit
you
are
to
watch
the
grove
every
evening
when
the
present
moon
gets
hare
covered
her
face
for
some
minutes
thank
god
for
all
his
mercies
she
murmured
oh
mamma
but
it
is
an
awful
risk
for
him
to
run
but
to
know
that
he
is
in
life
to
know
that
he
is
in
life
and
for
the
risk
barbara
i
dread
it
not
the
same
god
who
protected
him
through
the
last
visit
will
protect
him
through
this
he
will
not
forsake
the
oppressed
the
innocent
destroy
the
paper
archibald
carlyle
must
first
see
it
i
shall
not
be
easy
until
it
is
destroyed
braving
the
comments
of
the
gossips
hoping
the
visit
would
not
reach
the
ears
or
eyes
of
the
justice
barbara
went
that
day
to
the
office
of
carlyle
he
was
not
there
he
was
at
west
lynne
he
had
gone
to
lynneborough
on
business
and
dill
thought
it
a
question
if
he
would
be
at
the
office
again
that
day
if
so
it
would
be
late
in
the
afternoon
barbara
as
soon
as
their
own
dinner
was
over
took
up
her
patient
station
at
the
gate
hoping
to
see
him
pass
but
the
time
went
by
and
he
did
not
she
had
little
doubt
that
he
had
returned
home
without
going
to
west
lynne
what
should
she
do
go
up
to
east
lynne
and
see
him
said
her
conscience
barbara
s
mind
was
in
a
strangely
excited
state
it
appeared
to
her
that
this
visit
of
richard
s
must
have
been
specially
designed
by
providence
that
he
might
be
confronted
by
thorn
mamma
she
said
returning
indoors
after
seeing
the
justice
depart
upon
an
evening
visit
to
the
buck
s
head
where
he
and
certain
other
justices
and
gentlemen
sometimes
congregated
to
smoke
and
chat
i
shall
go
up
to
east
lynne
if
you
have
no
objection
i
must
see
away
went
barbara
it
had
struck
seven
when
she
arrived
at
east
lynne
is
carlyle
disengaged
mr
carlyle
is
not
yet
home
miss
my
lady
and
miss
carlyle
are
waiting
dinner
for
a
check
for
barbara
the
servant
asked
her
to
walk
in
but
she
declined
and
turned
from
the
door
she
was
in
no
mood
for
visit
paying
lady
isabel
had
been
standing
at
the
window
watching
for
her
husband
and
wondering
what
made
him
so
late
she
observed
barbara
approach
the
house
and
saw
her
walk
away
again
presently
the
servant
who
had
answered
the
door
entered
the
was
not
that
miss
hare
yes
my
lady
was
the
man
s
reply
she
wanted
master
i
said
your
ladyship
was
at
home
but
she
would
not
isabel
said
no
more
she
caught
the
eyes
of
francis
levison
fixed
on
her
with
as
much
meaning
compassionate
meaning
as
they
dared
express
she
clasped
her
hands
in
pain
and
turned
again
to
the
window
barbara
was
slowly
walking
down
the
avenue
carlyle
was
then
in
sight
walking
quickly
up
it
lady
isabel
saw
their
hands
meet
in
greeting
oh
i
am
so
thankful
to
have
met
you
barbara
exclaimed
to
him
impulsively
i
actually
went
to
your
office
and
i
have
been
now
to
your
house
we
have
such
news
ay
what
about
thorn
no
about
richard
replied
barbara
taking
the
scrap
of
paper
from
the
folds
of
her
dress
this
came
to
me
this
morning
from
carlyle
took
the
document
and
barbara
looked
over
him
whilst
he
read
it
neither
of
them
thinking
that
lady
isabel
s
jealous
eyes
and
captain
levison
s
evil
ones
were
strained
upon
them
from
the
distant
windows
miss
carlyle
s
also
for
the
matter
of
that
archibald
it
seems
to
me
that
providence
must
be
directing
him
hither
at
this
moment
our
suspicions
with
regard
to
thorn
can
now
be
set
at
rest
you
must
contrive
that
richard
shall
see
him
what
can
he
be
coming
again
for
more
money
was
the
supposition
of
carlyle
does
hare
know
of
this
she
does
unfortunately
i
opened
the
paper
before
her
never
dreaming
it
was
connected
with
richard
poor
unhappy
richard
and
not
to
be
he
acted
as
though
he
were
guilty
barbara
and
that
line
of
conduct
often
entails
as
much
trouble
as
real
you
do
not
believe
him
guilty
she
most
passionately
uttered
i
do
not
i
have
little
doubt
of
the
guilt
of
oh
if
it
could
but
be
brought
home
to
him
returned
barbara
so
that
richard
might
be
cleared
in
the
sight
of
day
how
can
you
contrive
that
he
shall
see
thorn
i
can
not
tell
i
must
think
it
over
let
me
know
the
instant
he
arrives
of
course
i
shall
it
may
be
that
he
does
not
want
money
that
his
errand
is
only
to
see
mamma
he
was
always
so
fond
of
i
must
leave
you
said
carlyle
taking
her
hand
in
token
of
farewell
then
as
a
thought
occurred
to
him
he
turned
and
walked
a
few
steps
with
her
without
releasing
it
he
was
probably
unconscious
that
he
retained
it
she
was
not
you
know
barbara
if
he
should
want
money
and
it
be
not
convenient
to
hare
to
supply
it
at
so
short
a
notice
i
can
give
it
to
him
as
i
did
thank
you
thank
you
archibald
mamma
felt
sure
you
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
with
an
expression
of
gratitude
a
warmer
feeling
for
an
uncontrolled
moment
mingled
with
it
carlyle
nodded
pleasantly
and
then
set
off
toward
his
house
at
the
pace
of
a
steam
engine
two
minutes
in
his
and
he
entered
the
apologizing
for
keeping
them
waiting
dinner
and
explaining
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
go
to
his
office
to
give
some
orders
subsequent
to
his
return
to
lynneborough
lady
isabel
s
lips
were
pressed
together
and
she
preserved
an
obstinate
silence
carlyle
in
his
unsuspicion
did
not
notice
it
what
did
barbara
hare
want
demanded
miss
carlyle
during
dinner
she
wanted
to
see
me
on
business
was
his
reply
given
in
a
tone
that
certainly
did
not
invite
his
sister
to
pursue
the
subject
will
you
take
some
more
fish
isabel
what
was
that
you
were
reading
over
with
her
pursued
the
indefatigable
miss
corny
it
looked
like
a
ah
that
would
be
telling
returned
carlyle
willing
to
turn
it
off
with
gayety
if
young
ladies
choose
to
make
me
party
to
their
love
letters
i
can
not
betray
confidence
you
what
rubbish
archibald
quoth
she
as
if
you
could
not
say
outright
what
barbara
wants
without
making
a
mystery
of
it
and
she
seems
to
be
always
wanting
you
carlyle
glanced
at
his
sister
a
quick
peculiar
look
it
seemed
to
her
to
speak
both
of
seriousness
and
warning
involuntarily
her
thoughts
and
her
fears
flew
back
to
the
past
archibald
archibald
she
uttered
repeating
the
name
as
if
she
could
not
get
any
further
words
out
in
her
dread
it
it
is
never
that
old
affair
is
never
being
raked
up
again
now
miss
carlyle
s
old
affair
referred
to
one
sole
and
sore
point
richard
hare
and
so
carlyle
understood
it
lady
isabel
unhappily
believing
that
any
old
affair
could
only
have
reference
to
the
bygone
loves
of
her
husband
and
barbara
you
will
oblige
me
by
going
on
with
your
dinner
cornelia
gravely
responded
carlyle
then
assuming
a
more
laughing
tone
i
tell
you
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
me
to
betray
a
young
woman
s
secrets
although
she
may
choose
to
confide
them
professionally
to
me
what
say
you
captain
levison
the
gentleman
addressed
bowed
a
smile
of
mockery
all
too
perceptible
to
lady
isabel
on
his
lips
and
miss
carlyle
bent
her
head
over
her
plate
and
went
on
with
her
dinner
as
meek
as
any
lamb
that
same
evening
lady
isabel
s
indignant
and
rebellious
heart
condescended
to
speak
of
it
when
alone
with
her
husband
what
is
it
that
she
wants
with
you
so
much
that
barbara
hare
it
is
private
business
isabel
she
has
to
bring
me
messages
from
her
must
the
business
be
kept
from
me
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
considering
whether
he
might
tell
her
but
it
was
impossible
he
could
speak
even
to
his
wife
of
the
suspicion
they
were
attaching
to
captain
thorn
it
would
have
been
unfair
and
wrong
neither
could
he
betray
that
a
secret
visit
was
expected
from
richard
to
no
one
in
the
world
could
he
betray
that
however
safe
and
true
it
would
not
make
you
the
happier
to
know
it
isabel
there
is
a
dark
secret
you
are
aware
touching
the
hare
family
it
is
connected
with
she
did
not
put
faith
in
a
word
of
the
reply
she
believed
he
could
not
tell
her
because
her
feelings
as
his
wife
would
be
outraged
by
the
confession
and
it
goaded
her
anger
into
recklessness
carlyle
on
his
part
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
supposition
that
she
might
be
jealous
he
had
believed
that
nonsense
at
an
end
years
ago
he
was
perfectly
honorable
and
true
strictly
faithful
to
his
wife
giving
her
no
shadow
of
cause
or
reason
to
be
jealous
of
him
and
being
a
practical
man
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
could
be
so
lady
isabel
was
sitting
the
following
morning
moody
and
out
of
sorts
captain
levison
who
had
accompanied
carlyle
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
to
the
park
gate
on
his
departure
and
then
stolen
along
the
hedgewalk
had
returned
to
lady
isabel
with
the
news
of
an
ardent
interview
with
barbara
who
had
been
watching
for
his
going
by
at
the
gate
of
the
grove
she
sat
sullenly
digesting
the
tidings
when
a
note
was
brought
in
it
proved
to
be
an
invitation
to
dinner
for
the
following
tuesday
at
a
jefferson
s
for
and
lady
isabel
carlyle
and
miss
carlyle
do
you
go
asked
miss
carlyle
yes
replied
isabel
mr
carlyle
and
i
both
want
a
change
of
some
sort
she
added
in
a
mocking
sort
of
spirit
it
may
be
well
to
have
it
if
only
for
an
in
truth
this
unhappy
jealousy
this
distrust
of
her
husband
appeared
to
have
altered
lady
isabel
s
very
nature
and
leave
captain
levison
returned
miss
carlyle
lady
isabel
went
over
to
her
desk
making
no
reply
what
will
you
do
with
him
i
ask
persisted
miss
carlyle
he
can
remain
here
he
can
dine
by
himself
shall
i
accept
the
invitation
for
you
no
i
shall
not
go
said
miss
carlyle
then
in
that
case
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
regard
to
captain
levison
coldly
spoke
lady
isabel
i
don
t
want
his
company
i
am
not
fond
of
it
cried
miss
carlyle
i
would
go
to
jefferson
s
but
that
i
should
want
a
new
that
s
easily
had
said
lady
isabel
i
shall
want
one
you
want
a
new
dress
uttered
miss
carlyle
why
you
have
a
dozen
i
don
t
know
that
i
could
count
a
dozen
in
all
returned
lady
isabel
chafing
at
the
remark
and
the
continual
thwarting
put
upon
her
by
miss
carlyle
which
had
latterly
seemed
more
than
hard
to
endure
petty
evils
are
more
difficult
to
support
than
great
ones
take
notice
lady
isabel
concluded
her
note
folded
sealed
it
and
then
rang
the
bell
as
the
man
left
the
room
with
it
she
desired
that
wilson
might
be
sent
to
her
is
it
this
morning
wilson
that
the
dressmaker
comes
to
try
on
miss
isabel
s
dress
she
inquired
wilson
hesitated
and
stammered
and
glanced
from
her
mistress
to
miss
carlyle
the
latter
looked
up
from
her
work
the
dressmaker
s
not
coming
spoke
she
sharply
i
countermanded
the
order
for
the
frock
for
isabel
does
not
require
she
does
require
it
answered
lady
isabel
in
perhaps
the
most
displeased
tone
she
had
ever
used
to
miss
carlyle
i
am
a
competent
judge
of
what
is
necessary
for
my
she
no
more
requires
a
new
frock
than
that
table
requires
one
or
that
you
require
the
one
you
are
longing
for
stoically
persisted
miss
carlyle
she
has
got
ever
so
many
lying
by
and
her
striped
silk
turned
will
make
up
as
handsome
as
wilson
backed
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
softly
but
her
mistress
caught
a
compassionate
look
directed
toward
her
her
heart
seemed
bursting
with
indignation
and
despair
there
seemed
to
be
no
side
on
which
she
could
turn
for
refuge
pitied
by
her
own
servants
she
reopened
her
desk
and
dashed
off
a
haughty
peremptory
note
for
the
attendance
of
the
dressmaker
at
east
lynne
commanding
its
immediate
dispatch
miss
corny
groaned
in
her
wrath
you
will
be
sorry
for
not
listening
to
me
ma
am
when
your
husband
shall
be
brought
to
poverty
he
works
like
a
horse
now
and
with
all
his
slaving
can
scarcely
i
fear
keep
expenses
poor
lady
isabel
ever
sensitive
began
to
think
they
might
with
one
another
be
spending
more
than
carlyle
s
means
would
justify
she
knew
their
expenses
were
heavy
the
same
tale
had
been
dinned
into
her
ears
ever
since
she
married
him
she
gave
up
in
that
moment
all
thought
of
the
new
dress
for
herself
and
for
isabel
but
her
spirit
in
her
deep
unhappiness
felt
sick
and
faint
within
her
wilson
meanwhile
had
flown
to
joyce
s
room
and
was
exercising
her
dearly
beloved
tongue
in
an
exaggerated
account
of
the
matter
how
miss
carlyle
put
upon
my
lady
and
had
forbidden
a
new
dress
to
her
as
well
as
the
frock
to
miss
isabel
and
yet
a
few
more
days
passed
on
chapter
xxiv
richard
hare
at
dill
s
window
bright
was
the
moon
on
that
genial
monday
night
bright
was
the
evening
star
as
they
shone
upon
a
solitary
wayfarer
who
walked
on
the
shady
side
of
the
road
with
his
head
down
as
though
he
did
not
care
to
court
observation
a
laborer
apparently
for
he
wore
a
and
had
hobnails
in
his
shoes
but
his
whiskers
were
large
and
black
quite
hiding
the
lower
part
of
his
face
and
his
came
far
over
his
brows
he
drew
near
the
dwelling
of
richard
hare
plunged
rapidly
over
some
palings
after
looking
well
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
into
a
field
and
thence
over
the
side
wall
into
hare
s
garden
where
he
remained
amidst
the
thick
trees
now
by
some
mischievous
spirit
of
intuition
or
contrariety
justice
hare
was
spending
this
evening
at
home
a
thing
he
did
not
do
once
in
six
months
unless
he
had
friends
with
him
things
in
real
life
do
mostly
go
by
the
rules
of
contrary
as
children
say
in
their
play
holding
the
corners
of
the
handkerchief
here
we
go
round
and
round
by
the
rules
of
contrary
if
i
tell
you
to
hold
fast
you
must
loose
if
i
tell
you
to
loose
you
must
hold
just
so
in
the
play
of
life
when
we
want
people
to
hold
fast
they
loose
and
when
we
want
them
to
loose
they
hold
barbara
anxious
troubled
worn
out
almost
with
the
suspense
of
looking
and
watching
for
her
brother
feeling
a
feverish
expectation
that
night
would
bring
him
but
so
had
she
felt
for
the
two
or
three
nights
past
would
have
given
her
hand
for
her
father
to
go
out
but
no
things
were
going
by
the
rule
of
contrary
there
sat
the
stern
justice
in
full
view
of
the
garden
and
the
grove
his
chair
drawn
precisely
in
front
of
the
window
his
wig
awry
and
a
long
pipe
in
his
mouth
are
you
not
going
out
richard
hare
ventured
to
say
mamma
shall
i
ring
for
the
shutters
to
be
closed
asked
barbara
by
and
by
shutters
closed
said
the
justice
who
d
shut
out
this
bright
moon
you
have
got
the
lamp
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
young
lady
and
can
go
to
barbara
ejaculated
an
inward
prayer
for
patience
for
safety
of
richard
if
he
did
come
and
waited
on
watching
the
grove
in
the
distance
it
came
the
signal
her
quick
eye
caught
it
a
movement
as
if
some
person
or
thing
had
stepped
out
beyond
the
trees
and
stepped
back
again
barbara
s
face
turned
white
and
her
lips
dry
i
am
so
hot
she
exclaimed
in
her
confused
eagerness
for
an
excuse
i
must
take
a
turn
in
the
she
stole
out
throwing
a
dark
shawl
over
her
shoulders
that
might
render
her
less
conspicuous
to
the
justice
and
her
dress
that
evening
was
a
dark
silk
she
did
not
dare
to
stand
still
when
she
reached
the
trees
or
to
penetrate
them
but
she
caught
glimpses
of
richard
s
face
and
her
heart
ached
at
the
change
in
it
it
was
white
thin
and
full
of
care
and
his
hair
he
told
her
was
turning
gray
oh
richard
darling
and
i
may
not
stop
to
talk
to
you
she
wailed
in
a
deep
whisper
papa
is
at
home
you
see
of
all
the
nights
in
the
can
t
i
see
my
mother
how
can
you
you
must
wait
till
i
don
t
like
waiting
a
second
night
barbara
there
s
danger
in
every
inch
of
ground
that
this
neighborhood
but
you
must
wait
richard
for
reasons
that
man
who
caused
all
the
mischief
thorn
hang
him
gloomily
interrupted
richard
he
is
at
west
lynne
at
least
there
is
a
thorn
we
i
and
carlyle
believe
to
be
the
same
and
we
want
you
to
see
let
me
see
him
panted
richard
whom
the
news
appeared
to
agitate
let
me
see
him
barbara
i
say
barbara
had
passed
on
again
returning
presently
you
know
richard
i
must
keep
moving
with
papa
s
eyes
there
he
is
a
tall
man
very
very
fond
of
dress
and
ornament
especially
of
that
s
he
cried
richard
eagerly
mr
carlyle
will
contrive
that
you
shall
see
him
she
continued
stooping
as
if
to
tie
her
shoe
should
it
prove
to
be
the
same
perhaps
nothing
can
be
done
immediately
done
toward
clearing
you
but
it
shall
be
a
great
point
ascertained
are
you
sure
you
should
know
him
again
sure
that
i
should
know
him
uttered
richard
hare
should
i
know
my
own
father
should
i
know
you
and
are
you
not
engraven
on
my
heart
in
letters
of
blood
as
is
he
how
and
when
am
i
to
see
him
barbara
i
can
tell
you
nothing
till
i
have
seen
carlyle
be
here
as
soon
as
ever
the
dusk
will
permit
you
perhaps
carlyle
will
contrive
to
bring
him
here
if
the
window
was
thrown
open
and
the
stentorian
voice
of
justice
hare
was
heard
from
it
barbara
are
you
wandering
about
there
to
take
cold
come
in
come
in
i
say
oh
richard
i
am
so
sorry
she
lingered
to
whisper
but
papa
is
sure
to
be
out
evening
he
would
not
stay
in
two
evenings
running
there
must
be
no
delay
now
and
the
next
day
barbara
braving
comments
appeared
once
more
at
the
office
of
carlyle
terribly
did
the
rules
of
contrary
seem
in
action
just
then
carlyle
was
not
in
and
the
clerks
did
not
know
when
to
expect
him
he
was
gone
out
for
some
hours
they
believed
mr
dill
urged
barbara
as
the
old
gentleman
came
to
the
door
to
greet
her
i
must
see
he
will
not
be
in
till
late
in
the
afternoon
miss
barbara
i
expect
him
then
is
it
anything
i
can
do
no
no
sighed
barbara
at
that
moment
lady
isabel
and
her
little
girl
passed
in
the
chariot
she
saw
barbara
at
her
husband
s
door
what
should
she
be
doing
there
unless
paying
him
a
visit
a
slight
haughty
bow
to
barbara
a
pleasant
nod
and
smile
to
dill
and
the
carriage
bowled
on
it
was
four
o
clock
before
barbara
could
see
carlyle
and
communicate
her
tidings
that
richard
had
arrived
carlyle
held
deceit
and
all
underhand
doings
in
especial
abhorrence
yet
he
deemed
that
he
was
acting
right
under
the
circumstances
in
allowing
captain
thorn
to
be
secretly
seen
by
richard
hare
in
haste
he
arranged
his
plans
it
was
the
evening
of
his
own
dinner
engagement
at
jefferson
s
but
that
he
must
give
up
telling
barbara
to
dispatch
richard
to
his
office
as
soon
as
he
should
make
his
appearance
at
the
grove
and
to
urge
him
to
come
boldly
and
not
fear
for
none
would
know
him
in
his
disguise
he
wrote
a
hurried
note
to
thorn
requesting
him
also
to
be
at
his
office
at
eight
o
clock
that
evening
as
he
had
something
to
communicate
to
him
the
latter
plea
was
no
fiction
for
he
had
received
an
important
communication
that
morning
relative
to
the
business
on
which
captain
thorn
had
consulted
him
and
his
own
absence
from
the
office
in
the
day
had
alone
prevented
his
sending
for
him
earlier
other
matters
were
calling
the
attention
of
carlyle
and
it
was
five
o
clock
ere
he
departed
for
east
lynne
he
would
not
have
gone
so
early
but
that
he
must
inform
his
wife
of
his
inability
to
keep
his
dinner
engagement
carlyle
was
one
who
never
hesitated
to
sacrifice
personal
gratification
to
friendship
or
to
business
the
chariot
was
at
the
door
and
lady
isabel
dressed
and
waiting
for
him
in
her
did
you
forget
that
the
jeffersons
dined
at
six
was
her
greeting
no
isabel
but
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
here
before
and
i
should
not
have
come
so
soon
but
to
tell
you
that
i
can
not
accompany
you
you
must
make
my
excuses
to
a
pause
strange
thoughts
were
running
through
lady
isabel
s
mind
why
so
she
inquired
some
business
has
arisen
which
i
am
compelled
to
attend
to
this
evening
as
soon
as
i
have
snatched
a
bit
of
dinner
at
home
i
must
hasten
back
to
the
was
he
making
this
excuse
to
spend
the
hours
of
her
absence
with
barbara
hare
the
idea
that
it
was
so
took
firm
possession
of
her
mind
and
remained
there
her
face
expressed
a
variety
of
feelings
the
most
prominent
that
of
resentment
carlyle
saw
it
you
must
not
be
vexed
isabel
i
assure
you
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
it
is
important
private
business
which
can
not
be
put
off
and
which
i
can
not
delegate
to
dill
i
am
sorry
it
should
have
so
you
never
return
to
the
office
in
the
evening
she
remarked
with
pale
lips
no
because
if
anything
arises
to
take
us
there
after
hours
dill
officiates
but
the
business
must
be
done
by
another
pause
lady
isabel
suddenly
broke
it
shall
you
join
us
later
in
the
evening
i
believe
i
shall
not
be
able
to
do
she
drew
her
light
shawl
around
her
shoulders
and
swept
down
the
staircase
carlyle
followed
to
place
her
in
the
carriage
when
he
said
farewell
she
never
answered
but
looked
out
straight
before
her
with
a
stony
look
what
time
my
lady
inquired
the
footman
as
he
alighted
at
jefferson
s
early
a
little
before
eight
o
clock
richard
hare
in
his
and
his
slouching
hat
and
his
false
whiskers
rang
dubiously
at
the
outer
door
of
carlyle
s
office
that
gentleman
instantly
opened
it
he
was
quite
alone
come
in
richard
said
he
grasping
his
hand
did
you
meet
any
whom
you
knew
i
never
looked
at
whom
i
met
sir
was
the
reply
i
thought
that
if
i
looked
at
people
they
might
look
at
me
so
i
came
straight
ahead
with
my
eyes
before
me
how
the
place
has
altered
there
s
a
new
brick
house
on
the
corner
where
old
morgan
s
shop
used
to
that
s
the
new
police
station
west
lynne
i
assure
you
is
becoming
grand
in
public
buildings
and
how
have
you
been
richard
ailing
and
wretched
answered
richard
hare
how
can
i
be
otherwise
carlyle
with
so
false
an
accusation
attached
to
me
and
working
like
a
slave
as
i
have
to
do
you
may
take
off
the
disfiguring
hat
richard
no
one
is
richard
slowly
heaved
it
from
his
brows
and
his
fair
face
so
like
his
mother
s
was
disclosed
but
the
moment
he
was
uncovered
he
turned
shrinkingly
toward
the
entrance
door
if
any
one
should
come
in
sir
impossible
replied
carlyle
the
front
door
is
fast
and
the
office
is
supposed
to
be
empty
at
this
for
if
i
should
be
seen
and
recognized
it
might
come
to
hanging
you
know
sir
you
are
expecting
that
cursed
thorn
here
barbara
told
directly
replied
carlyle
observing
the
mode
of
addressing
him
it
spoke
plainly
of
the
scale
of
society
in
which
richard
had
been
mixing
that
he
was
with
those
who
said
it
habitually
nay
that
he
used
it
habitually
himself
from
your
description
of
the
lieutenant
thorn
who
destroyed
hallijohn
we
believe
this
captain
thorn
to
be
the
same
man
pursued
carlyle
in
person
he
appears
to
tally
exactly
and
i
have
ascertained
that
a
few
years
ago
he
was
a
deal
at
swainson
and
got
into
some
sort
of
scrape
he
is
in
john
herbert
s
regiment
and
is
here
with
him
on
a
but
what
an
idiot
he
must
be
to
venture
here
uttered
richard
here
of
all
places
in
the
world
he
counts
no
doubt
on
not
being
known
so
far
as
i
can
find
out
richard
nobody
here
did
know
him
save
you
and
afy
i
shall
put
you
in
dill
s
room
you
may
remember
the
little
window
in
it
and
from
thence
you
can
take
a
full
view
of
thorn
whom
i
shall
keep
in
the
front
office
you
are
sure
you
would
recognize
him
at
this
distance
of
time
i
should
know
him
if
it
were
fifty
years
to
come
i
should
know
him
were
he
disguised
as
i
am
disguised
we
can
not
richard
sank
his
voice
forget
a
man
who
has
been
the
object
of
our
frenzied
what
has
brought
you
to
east
lynne
again
richard
any
particular
object
chiefly
a
hankering
within
me
that
i
could
not
get
rid
of
replied
richard
it
was
not
so
much
to
see
my
mother
and
barbara
though
i
did
want
that
especially
since
my
illness
as
that
a
feeling
was
within
me
that
i
could
not
rest
away
from
it
so
i
said
i
d
risk
it
again
just
for
a
i
thought
you
might
possibly
want
some
assistance
as
i
do
want
that
also
said
richard
not
much
my
illness
has
run
me
into
debt
and
if
my
mother
can
let
me
have
a
little
i
shall
be
i
am
sure
she
will
answered
carlyle
you
shall
have
it
from
me
what
has
been
the
matter
with
you
the
beginning
of
it
was
a
kick
from
a
horse
sir
that
was
last
winter
and
it
laid
me
up
for
six
weeks
then
in
the
spring
after
i
got
well
and
was
at
work
again
i
caught
some
sort
of
fever
and
down
again
i
was
for
six
weeks
i
have
not
been
to
say
well
how
is
it
you
have
never
written
or
sent
me
your
address
because
i
dared
not
answered
richard
timorously
i
should
always
be
in
fear
not
of
you
carlyle
but
of
its
becoming
known
some
way
or
other
the
time
is
getting
on
sir
is
that
thorn
sure
to
come
he
sent
me
word
that
he
would
in
reply
to
my
note
and
there
he
is
uttered
carlyle
as
a
ring
was
heard
at
the
bell
now
richard
come
this
way
bring
your
richard
complied
by
putting
his
hat
on
his
head
pulling
it
so
low
that
it
touched
his
nose
he
felt
himself
safer
in
it
carlyle
showed
him
into
dill
s
room
and
then
turned
the
key
upon
him
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
whether
this
precautionary
measure
was
intended
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
captain
thorn
s
finding
his
way
in
or
of
richard
s
finding
his
way
out
was
best
known
to
himself
carlyle
came
to
the
front
door
opened
it
and
admitted
captain
thorn
he
brought
him
into
the
clerk
s
office
which
was
bright
with
gas
keeping
him
in
conversation
for
a
few
minutes
standing
and
then
asking
him
to
be
seated
all
in
full
view
of
the
little
window
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
being
late
captain
thorn
observed
i
am
half
an
hour
beyond
the
time
you
mentioned
but
the
herberts
had
two
or
three
friends
at
dinner
and
i
could
not
get
away
i
hope
carlyle
you
have
not
come
to
your
office
purposely
for
business
must
be
attended
to
somewhat
evasively
answered
carlyle
i
have
been
out
myself
nearly
all
day
we
received
a
communication
from
london
this
morning
relative
to
your
affair
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
anything
but
satisfactory
they
will
not
but
i
am
not
liable
carlyle
not
liable
in
no
if
what
you
tell
me
be
correct
but
justice
and
law
are
sometimes
in
opposition
captain
captain
thorn
sat
in
perplexity
they
will
not
get
me
arrested
here
will
they
they
would
have
done
it
beyond
doubt
but
i
have
caused
a
letter
to
be
written
and
dispatched
to
them
which
must
bring
forth
an
answer
before
any
violent
proceedings
are
taken
that
answer
will
be
here
the
morning
after
and
what
am
i
do
to
then
i
think
it
is
probable
there
may
be
a
way
of
checkmating
them
but
i
am
not
sure
captain
thorn
that
i
can
give
my
attention
further
to
this
i
hope
and
trust
you
will
was
the
reply
you
have
not
forgotten
that
i
told
you
at
first
i
could
not
promise
to
do
so
rejoined
carlyle
you
shall
hear
from
me
if
i
carry
it
on
for
you
i
will
then
appoint
an
hour
for
you
to
be
here
on
the
following
day
if
not
why
i
dare
say
you
will
find
a
solicitor
as
capable
of
assisting
you
as
i
but
why
will
you
not
what
is
the
reason
i
can
not
always
give
reasons
for
what
i
do
was
the
response
you
will
hear
from
me
he
rose
as
he
spoke
captain
thorn
also
rose
carlyle
detained
him
yet
a
few
moments
and
then
saw
him
out
at
the
front
door
and
fastened
it
he
returned
and
released
richard
the
latter
took
off
his
hat
as
he
advanced
into
the
blaze
of
light
well
richard
is
it
the
same
man
no
sir
not
in
the
least
like
carlyle
though
little
given
to
emotion
felt
a
strange
relief
relief
for
captain
thorn
s
sake
he
had
rarely
seen
one
whom
he
could
so
little
associate
with
the
notion
of
a
murderer
as
captain
thorn
and
he
was
a
man
who
exceedingly
won
upon
the
regard
he
would
heartily
help
him
out
of
his
dilemma
now
excepting
that
they
are
both
tall
with
nearly
the
same
color
of
hair
there
is
no
resemblance
whatever
between
them
proceeded
richard
their
faces
their
figures
are
as
opposite
as
light
is
from
dark
that
other
in
spite
of
his
handsome
features
had
the
expression
at
times
of
a
demon
but
this
one
s
expression
is
the
best
part
of
his
face
hallijohn
s
murderer
had
a
curious
look
here
where
questioned
carlyle
for
richard
had
only
pointed
to
his
face
generally
well
i
can
not
say
precisely
where
it
lay
whether
in
the
eyebrows
or
the
eyes
i
could
not
tell
when
i
used
to
have
him
before
me
but
it
was
in
one
of
them
ah
carlyle
i
thought
when
barbara
told
me
thorn
was
here
it
was
too
good
news
to
be
true
depend
upon
it
he
won
t
venture
to
west
lynne
again
this
man
is
no
more
like
that
other
villain
than
you
are
like
then
as
that
is
set
at
rest
we
had
better
be
going
richard
you
have
to
see
your
mother
and
she
must
be
waiting
in
anxiety
how
much
money
do
you
want
pounds
would
do
but
richard
stopped
in
hesitation
but
what
asked
carlyle
speak
out
thirty
would
be
more
welcome
thirty
would
put
me
at
you
shall
take
thirty
said
carlyle
counting
out
the
notes
to
him
now
will
you
walk
with
me
to
the
grove
or
will
you
walk
alone
i
mean
to
see
you
there
in
richard
thought
he
would
prefer
to
walk
alone
everybody
they
met
might
be
speaking
to
carlyle
the
latter
inquired
why
he
chose
moonlight
nights
for
his
visits
it
is
pleasanter
for
travelling
and
had
i
chosen
dark
nights
barbara
could
not
have
seen
my
signal
from
the
trees
was
the
answer
of
richard
they
went
out
and
proceeded
unmolested
to
the
house
of
justice
hare
it
was
past
nine
then
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
carlyle
whispered
richard
as
they
walked
up
the
path
i
wish
i
could
help
you
more
effectually
richard
and
clear
up
the
mystery
is
barbara
on
the
watch
yes
there
s
the
door
slowly
richard
stole
across
the
hall
and
into
the
parlor
to
his
mother
barbara
approached
and
softly
whispered
to
carlyle
standing
just
outside
the
portico
her
voice
trembled
with
the
suspense
of
what
the
answer
might
be
is
it
the
same
man
the
same
thorn
no
richard
says
this
man
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
real
oh
uttered
barbara
in
her
surprise
and
disappointment
not
the
same
and
for
the
best
part
of
poor
richard
s
evening
to
have
been
taken
up
for
not
quite
nothing
said
carlyle
the
question
is
now
set
at
set
at
rest
repeated
barbara
it
is
left
in
more
uncertainty
than
set
at
rest
so
far
as
regards
captain
thorn
and
whilst
our
suspicions
were
concentrated
upon
him
we
thought
not
of
looking
to
other
when
they
entered
the
hare
was
crying
over
richard
and
richard
was
crying
over
her
but
she
seized
the
hand
of
carlyle
you
have
been
very
kind
i
don
t
know
whatever
we
should
do
without
you
and
i
want
to
tax
your
kindness
further
has
barbara
mentioned
it
i
could
not
talk
in
the
hall
mamma
the
servants
might
have
mr
hare
is
not
well
and
we
terribly
fear
he
will
be
home
early
in
consequence
otherwise
we
should
have
been
quite
safe
until
after
ten
for
he
is
gone
to
the
buck
s
head
and
they
never
leave
you
know
till
that
hour
has
struck
should
he
come
in
and
see
richard
oh
i
need
not
enlarge
upon
the
consequences
to
you
archibald
the
very
thought
sends
me
into
a
shiver
barbara
and
i
have
been
discussing
it
all
the
evening
and
we
can
only
think
of
one
plan
it
is
that
you
will
kindly
stay
in
the
garden
near
the
gate
and
should
he
come
in
stop
him
and
keep
him
in
conversation
barbara
will
be
with
you
and
will
run
in
with
the
warning
and
richard
can
go
inside
the
closet
in
the
hall
till
hare
has
entered
and
is
safe
in
this
room
and
then
he
can
make
his
escape
will
you
do
this
archibald
certainly
i
i
can
not
part
with
him
before
ten
o
clock
unless
i
am
forced
she
whispered
pressing
carlyle
s
hands
in
her
earnest
gratitude
you
don
t
know
what
it
is
archibald
to
have
a
lost
son
home
for
an
hour
but
once
in
seven
years
at
ten
o
clock
we
will
carlyle
and
barbara
began
to
pace
in
the
path
in
compliance
with
the
wish
of
hare
keeping
near
the
entrance
gate
when
they
were
turning
the
second
time
carlyle
offered
her
his
arm
it
was
an
act
of
mere
politeness
barbara
took
it
and
there
they
waited
and
waited
but
the
justice
did
not
come
punctually
to
the
minute
half
after
nine
lady
isabel
s
carriage
arrived
at
jefferson
s
and
she
came
out
immediately
a
headache
being
the
plea
for
her
early
departure
she
had
not
far
to
go
to
reach
east
lynne
about
two
miles
and
it
was
a
nearly
all
the
way
they
could
emerge
into
the
open
road
if
they
pleased
but
it
was
a
trifle
further
suddenly
a
gentleman
approached
the
carriage
as
it
was
bowling
along
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
coachman
to
pull
up
in
spite
of
the
glowing
moonlight
lady
isabel
did
not
at
first
recognize
him
for
he
wore
a
disfigured
fur
cap
the
ears
of
which
were
tied
over
his
ears
and
cheeks
it
was
francis
levison
she
put
down
the
window
i
thought
it
must
be
your
carriage
how
early
you
are
returning
were
you
tired
of
your
entertainers
why
he
knew
what
time
my
lady
was
returning
thought
john
to
himself
he
asked
me
a
false
sort
of
a
chap
that
i
ve
a
i
came
out
for
a
midnight
stroll
and
have
tired
myself
he
proceeded
will
you
take
compassion
on
me
and
give
me
a
seat
home
she
acquiesced
she
could
not
do
otherwise
the
footman
sprang
from
behind
the
door
and
francis
levison
took
his
place
beside
lady
isabel
take
the
high
road
he
put
out
his
head
to
say
to
the
coachman
and
the
man
touched
his
hat
which
high
road
would
cause
them
to
pass
hare
s
i
did
not
know
you
she
began
gathering
herself
into
her
own
corner
what
ugly
thing
is
that
you
have
on
it
is
like
a
he
was
taking
off
the
ugly
thing
as
she
spoke
and
began
to
twirl
it
round
his
hand
disguise
oh
no
i
have
no
creditors
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
east
false
as
ever
it
was
worn
as
a
disguise
and
he
knew
it
is
carlyle
at
home
she
inquired
then
after
a
pause
i
expect
he
is
more
agreeably
the
tone
a
most
significant
one
brought
the
tingling
blood
to
the
cheeks
of
lady
isabel
she
wished
to
preserve
a
dignified
silence
and
did
for
a
few
moments
but
the
jealous
question
broke
out
engaged
in
what
manner
as
i
came
by
hare
s
house
just
now
i
saw
two
people
a
gentleman
and
a
young
lady
coupled
lovingly
together
enjoying
a
by
moonlight
unless
i
am
mistaken
he
was
the
favored
individual
whom
you
call
lord
and
lady
isabel
almost
gnashed
her
teeth
the
jealous
doubts
which
had
been
tormenting
her
all
the
evening
were
confirmed
that
the
man
whom
she
hated
yes
in
her
blind
anger
she
hated
him
then
should
so
impose
upon
her
should
excuse
himself
by
lies
lies
base
and
false
as
he
was
from
accompanying
her
out
on
purpose
to
pass
the
hours
with
barbara
hare
had
she
been
alone
in
the
carriage
a
torrent
of
passion
had
probably
escaped
her
she
leaned
back
panting
in
her
emotion
but
hiding
it
from
captain
levison
as
they
came
opposite
to
justice
hare
s
she
deliberately
bent
forward
and
scanned
the
garden
with
eager
eyes
there
in
the
bright
moonlight
all
too
bright
and
clear
slowly
paced
arm
in
arm
and
drawn
close
to
each
other
her
husband
and
barbara
hare
with
a
choking
sob
that
could
no
longer
be
controlled
or
hidden
lady
isabel
sunk
back
again
he
that
bold
bad
man
dared
to
put
his
arm
around
her
to
draw
her
to
his
side
to
whisper
that
his
love
was
left
to
her
if
another
s
was
withdrawn
she
was
most
assuredly
out
of
her
senses
that
night
or
she
never
would
have
listened
a
jealous
woman
is
mad
an
outraged
woman
is
doubly
mad
and
the
fated
lady
isabel
truly
believed
that
every
sacred
feeling
which
ought
to
exist
between
man
and
wife
was
betrayed
by
carlyle
be
avenged
on
that
false
hound
isabel
he
was
never
worthy
of
you
leave
your
life
of
misery
and
come
to
in
her
bitter
distress
and
wrath
she
broke
into
a
storm
of
sobs
were
they
caused
by
passion
against
her
husband
or
by
those
bold
and
shameless
words
alas
alas
francis
levison
applied
himself
to
soothe
her
with
all
the
sweet
and
dangerous
sophistry
of
his
crafty
nature
the
minutes
flew
on
a
quarter
to
ten
now
a
quarter
past
ten
and
still
richard
hare
lingered
on
with
his
mother
and
still
carlyle
and
barbara
paced
patiently
the
garden
path
at
ten
richard
came
forth
after
having
taken
his
last
farewell
then
came
barbara
s
tearful
farewell
which
carlyle
witnessed
and
then
a
hard
grasp
of
that
gentleman
s
hand
and
richard
plunged
amidst
the
trees
to
depart
the
way
he
came
good
night
barbara
said
carlyle
will
you
not
come
in
and
say
good
night
to
mamma
not
now
it
is
late
tell
her
how
glad
i
am
things
have
gone
off
so
he
started
off
at
a
strapping
pace
toward
his
home
and
barbara
leaned
on
the
gate
to
indulge
her
tears
not
a
soul
passed
to
interrupt
her
and
the
justice
did
not
come
what
could
have
become
of
him
what
could
the
buck
s
head
be
thinking
of
to
retain
respectable
elderly
justices
from
their
beds
who
ought
to
go
home
early
and
set
a
good
example
to
the
parish
barbara
knew
the
next
day
that
justice
hare
with
a
few
more
gentlemen
had
been
seduced
from
the
staid
old
inn
to
a
friend
s
house
to
an
entertainment
of
supper
pipes
and
whist
two
tables
penny
points
and
it
was
between
twelve
and
one
ere
the
party
rose
from
the
fascination
so
far
well
as
it
happened
barbara
knew
not
how
long
she
lingered
at
the
gate
ten
minutes
it
may
have
been
nobody
summoned
her
hare
was
indulging
her
grief
indoors
giving
no
thought
to
barbara
and
the
justice
did
not
make
his
appearance
exceedingly
surprised
was
barbara
to
hear
fast
footsteps
and
to
find
that
they
were
carlyle
s
the
more
haste
the
less
speed
barbara
he
called
out
as
he
came
up
i
had
got
home
and
have
had
to
come
back
again
when
i
went
into
your
i
left
a
small
parcel
containing
a
parchment
on
the
sideboard
will
you
get
it
for
me
barbara
ran
indoors
and
brought
forth
the
parcel
and
carlyle
with
a
brief
word
of
thanks
sped
away
with
it
she
leaned
on
the
gate
as
before
the
ready
tears
flowing
again
her
heart
was
aching
for
richard
it
was
aching
for
the
disappointment
the
night
had
brought
forth
respecting
captain
thorn
still
nobody
passed
still
the
steps
of
her
father
were
not
heard
and
barbara
stayed
on
but
what
was
that
figure
cowering
under
the
shade
of
the
hedge
at
a
distance
and
seemingly
watching
her
barbara
strained
her
eyes
while
her
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
burst
its
bounds
surely
surely
it
was
her
brother
what
had
he
ventured
back
for
richard
hare
it
was
when
fully
assured
that
barbara
was
standing
there
he
knew
the
justice
was
still
absent
and
ventured
to
advance
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
strange
state
of
emotion
his
breath
labored
his
whole
frame
trembling
barbara
barbara
he
called
i
have
seen
barbara
thought
him
demented
i
know
you
saw
him
she
slowly
said
but
it
was
not
the
right
not
he
breathed
richard
and
not
the
gentleman
i
saw
in
carlyle
s
office
i
have
seen
the
fellow
himself
why
to
you
stare
at
me
so
barbara
barbara
was
in
truth
scanning
his
face
keenly
it
appeared
to
her
a
strange
tale
that
he
was
telling
when
i
left
here
i
cut
across
into
bean
lane
which
is
more
private
for
me
than
this
road
proceeded
richard
just
as
i
got
to
that
clump
of
trees
you
know
it
barbara
i
saw
somebody
coming
toward
me
from
a
distance
i
stepped
back
behind
the
trunks
of
the
trees
into
the
shade
of
the
hedge
for
i
don
t
care
to
be
met
though
i
am
disguised
he
came
along
the
middle
of
the
lane
going
toward
west
lynne
and
i
looked
out
upon
him
i
knew
him
long
before
he
was
abreast
of
me
it
was
barbara
made
no
comment
she
was
digesting
the
news
every
drop
of
blood
within
me
began
to
tingle
and
an
impulse
came
upon
me
to
spring
upon
him
and
accuse
him
of
the
murder
of
hallijohn
went
on
richard
in
the
same
excited
manner
but
i
resisted
it
or
perhaps
my
courage
failed
one
of
the
reproaches
against
me
had
used
to
be
that
i
was
a
physical
coward
you
know
barbara
he
added
in
a
tone
of
bitterness
in
a
struggle
thorn
would
have
had
the
best
of
it
he
is
taller
and
more
powerful
than
i
and
might
have
battered
me
to
death
a
man
who
can
commit
one
murder
won
t
hesitate
at
a
richard
do
you
think
you
could
have
been
deceived
she
urged
you
had
been
talking
of
thorn
and
your
thoughts
were
naturally
bearing
upon
him
imagination
be
still
barbara
he
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
pain
imagination
indeed
did
i
not
tell
you
he
was
stamped
here
touching
his
breast
do
you
take
me
for
a
child
or
an
imbecile
that
i
should
fancy
i
see
thorn
in
every
shadow
or
meet
people
where
i
do
not
he
had
his
hat
off
as
if
he
had
been
walking
fast
and
had
got
hot
fast
he
was
walking
and
he
carried
the
hat
in
one
hand
and
what
looked
like
a
small
parcel
with
the
other
hand
he
was
pushing
the
hair
from
his
this
way
a
peculiar
way
added
richard
slightly
lifting
his
own
hat
and
pushing
back
his
hair
by
that
action
alone
i
should
have
known
him
for
he
was
always
doing
it
in
the
old
days
and
there
was
his
white
hand
adorned
with
his
diamond
ring
barbara
the
diamond
glittered
in
the
moonlight
richard
s
voice
and
manner
were
singularly
earnest
and
a
conviction
of
the
truth
of
his
assertion
flashed
over
his
sister
i
saw
his
face
as
plainly
as
i
ever
saw
it
every
feature
he
is
scarcely
altered
save
for
a
haggardness
in
his
cheeks
now
barbara
you
need
not
doubt
me
i
swear
it
was
thorn
she
grew
excited
as
he
was
now
that
she
believed
the
news
it
was
telling
upon
her
reason
left
its
place
and
impulse
succeeded
barbara
did
not
wait
to
weigh
her
actions
richard
carlyle
ought
to
know
this
he
has
but
just
gone
we
may
overtake
him
if
we
forgetting
the
strange
appearances
it
would
have
her
flying
along
the
public
road
at
that
hour
of
the
night
should
she
meet
any
who
knew
what
the
consequence
might
be
did
justice
hare
return
and
find
her
absent
barbara
set
off
with
a
fleet
foot
richard
more
stealthily
following
her
his
eyes
cast
in
all
directions
fortunately
barbara
wore
a
bonnet
and
mantle
which
she
had
put
on
to
pace
the
garden
with
carlyle
fortunately
also
the
road
was
remarkably
empty
of
passengers
she
succeeded
in
reaching
carlyle
before
he
turned
into
east
lynne
gates
barbara
he
exclaimed
in
the
extreme
of
astonishment
barbara
archibald
archibald
she
panted
gasping
for
breath
i
am
not
out
of
my
mind
but
do
come
and
speak
to
richard
he
has
just
seen
the
real
carlyle
amazed
and
wondering
turned
back
they
got
over
the
field
stile
nearly
opposite
the
gates
drew
behind
the
hedge
and
there
richard
told
his
tale
carlyle
did
not
appear
to
doubt
it
as
barbara
had
done
perhaps
he
could
not
in
the
face
of
richard
s
agitated
and
intense
earnestness
i
am
sure
there
is
no
one
named
thorn
in
the
neighborhood
save
the
gentleman
you
saw
in
my
office
richard
observed
carlyle
after
some
deliberation
it
is
very
he
may
be
staying
here
under
a
feigned
name
replied
richard
there
can
be
no
mistake
that
it
was
thorn
whom
i
have
just
how
was
he
dressed
as
a
gentleman
catch
him
dressing
as
anything
else
returned
richard
he
was
in
an
evening
suit
of
black
with
a
sort
of
thin
overcoat
thrown
on
but
it
was
flung
back
at
the
shoulders
and
i
distinctly
saw
his
clothes
a
gray
alpaca
it
looked
like
as
i
have
told
barbara
i
should
have
known
him
by
this
action
of
the
hand
imitating
it
as
he
pushed
his
hair
off
his
forehead
it
was
the
delicate
white
hand
of
the
days
gone
by
carlyle
it
was
the
flashing
of
the
diamond
ring
carlyle
was
silent
barbara
also
but
the
thoughts
of
both
were
busy
richard
observed
the
former
i
should
advise
you
to
remain
a
day
or
two
in
the
neighborhood
and
look
out
for
this
man
you
may
see
him
again
and
may
track
him
home
it
is
very
desirable
to
find
out
who
he
really
is
if
but
the
danger
urged
richard
your
fears
magnify
that
i
am
quite
certain
that
nobody
would
know
you
in
broad
daylight
disguised
as
you
are
now
so
many
years
have
flown
since
that
people
have
forgotten
to
think
about
you
but
richard
could
not
be
persuaded
he
was
full
of
fears
he
described
the
man
as
accurately
as
he
could
to
carlyle
and
barbara
and
told
them
they
must
look
out
with
some
trouble
carlyle
got
from
him
an
address
in
london
to
which
he
might
write
in
case
anything
turned
up
and
richard
s
presence
should
be
necessary
he
then
once
more
said
farewell
and
quitted
them
his
way
lying
past
east
lynne
and
now
to
see
you
back
barbara
said
carlyle
indeed
you
shall
not
do
it
late
as
it
is
and
tired
as
you
must
be
i
came
here
alone
richard
did
not
keep
near
i
can
not
help
your
having
come
here
alone
but
you
may
rely
upon
it
i
do
not
suffer
you
to
go
back
so
nonsense
barbara
allow
you
to
go
along
the
high
road
by
yourself
at
eleven
o
clock
at
night
what
are
you
thinking
of
he
gave
barbara
his
arm
and
they
pursued
their
way
how
late
lady
isabel
will
think
you
observed
barbara
i
don
t
know
that
lady
isabel
has
returned
home
yet
my
being
late
once
in
a
while
is
of
no
not
another
word
was
spoken
save
by
barbara
whatever
excuse
can
i
make
should
papa
come
home
both
were
buried
in
their
own
reflections
thank
you
very
greatly
she
said
as
they
reached
her
gate
and
carlyle
finally
turned
away
barbara
stole
in
and
found
the
coast
clear
her
papa
had
not
arrived
lady
isabel
was
in
her
when
carlyle
entered
she
was
seated
at
a
table
writing
a
few
questions
as
to
her
evening
s
visit
which
she
answered
in
the
briefest
way
possible
and
then
he
asked
her
if
she
was
not
going
to
bed
by
and
by
i
am
not
i
must
go
at
once
isabel
for
i
am
dead
and
no
wonder
you
can
go
was
her
answer
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
but
she
dexterously
turned
her
face
away
he
supposed
that
she
felt
hurt
that
he
had
not
gone
with
her
to
the
party
and
placed
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
foolish
child
to
be
aggrieved
at
that
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
isabel
i
could
not
help
myself
i
will
talk
to
you
in
the
morning
i
am
too
tired
i
suppose
you
will
not
be
her
head
was
bent
over
her
writing
again
and
she
made
no
reply
carlyle
went
into
his
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
some
time
after
lady
isabel
went
softly
upstairs
to
joyce
s
room
joyce
fast
in
her
first
sleep
was
suddenly
aroused
from
it
there
stood
her
mistress
a
wax
light
in
her
hand
joyce
rubbed
her
eyes
and
collected
her
senses
and
finally
sat
up
in
bed
my
lady
are
you
ill
ill
yes
ill
and
wretched
answered
lady
isabel
and
ill
she
did
look
for
she
was
perfectly
white
joyce
i
want
a
promise
from
you
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
stay
at
east
lynne
with
my
joyce
stared
in
amazement
too
much
astonished
to
make
any
reply
joyce
you
promised
it
once
before
promise
it
again
whatever
betide
you
you
will
stay
with
my
children
when
i
am
i
will
stay
with
them
but
oh
my
lady
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
are
you
taken
suddenly
ill
joyce
murmured
lady
isabel
gliding
from
the
chamber
as
quietly
as
she
had
entered
it
and
joyce
after
an
hour
of
perplexity
dropped
asleep
again
joyce
was
not
the
only
one
whose
rest
was
disturbed
that
eventful
night
carlyle
himself
awoke
and
to
his
surprise
found
that
his
wife
had
not
come
to
bed
he
wondered
what
the
time
was
and
struck
his
repeater
a
quarter
past
three
rising
he
made
his
way
to
the
door
of
his
wife
s
it
was
in
darkness
and
so
far
as
he
could
judge
by
the
absence
of
sound
unoccupied
isabel
no
reply
nothing
but
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
in
the
silence
of
the
night
he
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
taper
partially
dressed
himself
and
went
about
to
look
for
her
he
feared
she
might
have
been
taken
ill
or
else
that
she
had
fallen
asleep
in
some
one
of
the
rooms
but
nowhere
could
he
find
her
and
feeling
perplexed
he
proceeded
to
his
sister
s
chamber
door
and
knocked
miss
carlyle
was
a
slight
sleeper
and
rose
up
in
bed
at
once
who
s
that
cried
out
she
it
is
only
i
cornelia
said
carlyle
you
cried
miss
corny
what
in
the
name
of
fortune
do
you
want
you
can
come
carlyle
opened
the
door
and
met
the
keen
eyes
of
his
sister
bent
on
him
from
the
bed
her
head
was
surmounted
by
a
remarkable
nightcap
at
least
a
foot
high
is
anybody
ill
she
demanded
i
think
isabel
must
be
i
can
not
find
not
find
her
echoed
miss
corny
why
what
s
the
time
is
she
not
in
bed
it
is
three
o
clock
she
had
not
been
to
bed
i
can
not
find
her
in
the
neither
is
she
in
the
children
s
then
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
archibald
she
s
gone
worrying
after
joyce
perhaps
the
girl
may
be
in
pain
carlyle
was
in
full
retreat
toward
joyce
s
room
at
this
suggestion
when
his
sister
called
to
him
if
anything
is
amiss
with
joyce
you
come
and
tell
me
archibald
for
i
shall
get
up
and
see
after
her
the
girl
was
my
servant
before
she
was
your
wife
he
reached
joyce
s
room
and
softly
unlatched
the
door
fully
expecting
to
find
a
light
there
and
his
wife
sitting
by
the
bedside
there
was
no
light
there
however
save
that
which
came
from
the
taper
he
held
and
he
saw
no
signs
of
his
wife
where
was
she
was
it
probable
that
joyce
should
tell
him
he
stepped
inside
the
room
and
called
to
her
joyce
started
up
in
a
fright
which
changed
to
astonishment
when
she
recognized
her
master
he
inquired
whether
lady
isabel
had
been
there
and
for
a
few
moments
joyce
did
not
answer
she
had
been
dreaming
of
lady
isabel
and
could
not
at
first
detach
the
dream
from
the
visit
which
had
probably
given
rise
to
it
what
did
you
say
sir
is
my
lady
worse
i
asked
if
she
had
been
here
i
can
not
find
why
yes
said
joyce
now
fully
aroused
she
came
here
and
woke
me
that
was
just
before
twelve
for
i
heard
the
clock
strike
she
did
not
stay
here
a
minute
woke
you
repeated
carlyle
what
did
she
want
what
did
she
come
here
for
thoughts
are
quick
imagination
is
still
quicker
and
joyce
was
giving
the
reins
to
both
her
mistress
s
gloomy
and
ambiguous
words
were
crowding
on
her
brain
three
o
clock
and
she
had
not
been
in
bed
and
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
house
a
nameless
horror
struggled
to
joyce
s
face
her
eyes
were
dilating
with
it
she
seized
and
threw
on
a
large
flannel
gown
which
lay
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
and
forgetful
of
her
master
who
stood
there
out
she
sprang
to
the
floor
all
minor
considerations
faded
to
insignificance
beside
the
terrible
dread
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
clasping
the
flannel
gown
tight
around
her
with
one
hand
she
laid
the
other
on
the
arm
of
carlyle
oh
master
oh
master
she
has
destroyed
herself
i
see
it
all
joyce
sternly
interrupted
carlyle
she
has
destroyed
herself
as
true
as
that
we
two
are
living
here
persisted
joyce
her
own
face
livid
with
emotion
i
can
understand
her
words
now
i
could
not
before
she
came
here
and
her
face
was
like
a
corpse
as
the
light
fell
upon
it
saying
she
had
come
to
get
a
promise
from
me
to
stay
with
her
children
when
she
was
gone
i
asked
whether
she
was
ill
and
she
answered
yes
ill
and
oh
sir
may
heaven
support
you
under
this
dreadful
trial
carlyle
felt
bewildered
perplexed
not
a
syllable
did
he
believe
he
was
not
angry
with
joyce
for
he
thought
she
had
lost
her
reason
it
is
so
sir
incredible
as
you
may
deem
my
words
pursued
joyce
wringing
her
hands
my
lady
has
been
miserably
unhappy
and
that
has
driven
her
to
joyce
are
you
in
your
senses
or
out
of
them
demanded
carlyle
a
certain
sternness
in
his
tone
your
lady
miserably
unhappy
what
do
you
mean
before
joyce
could
answer
an
addition
was
received
to
the
company
in
the
person
of
miss
carlyle
who
appeared
in
black
stockings
and
a
shawl
and
the
lofty
nightcap
hearing
voices
in
joyce
s
room
which
was
above
her
own
and
full
of
curiosity
she
ascended
not
choosing
to
be
shut
out
from
the
conference
whatever
s
up
cried
she
is
lady
isabel
found
she
is
not
found
and
she
never
will
be
found
but
in
her
sheet
returned
joyce
whose
lamentable
and
unusual
state
of
excitement
completely
overpowered
her
customary
quiet
respect
and
plain
good
sense
and
ma
am
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
up
for
what
i
was
about
to
say
to
my
master
i
would
prefer
to
say
in
your
presence
when
my
lady
is
brought
into
this
house
and
laid
before
us
dead
what
will
your
feelings
be
my
master
has
done
his
duty
by
her
in
love
but
you
you
have
made
her
life
a
misery
yes
ma
am
you
muttered
miss
carlyle
staring
at
joyce
in
consternation
what
is
all
this
where
s
my
lady
she
has
gone
and
taken
the
life
that
was
not
hers
to
take
sobbed
joyce
and
i
say
she
has
been
driven
to
it
she
has
not
been
allowed
to
indulge
a
will
of
her
own
poor
thing
since
she
came
to
east
lynne
in
her
own
house
she
has
been
less
free
than
either
of
her
servants
you
have
curbed
her
ma
am
and
snapped
at
her
and
you
made
her
feel
that
she
was
but
a
slave
to
your
caprices
and
temper
all
these
years
she
has
been
crossed
and
put
upon
everything
in
short
but
beaten
ma
am
you
know
she
has
and
has
borne
it
all
in
silence
like
a
patient
angel
never
as
i
believe
complaining
to
master
he
can
say
whether
she
has
or
not
we
all
loved
her
we
all
felt
for
her
and
my
master
s
heart
would
have
bled
had
he
suspected
what
she
had
to
put
up
with
day
after
day
and
year
after
miss
carlyle
s
tongue
was
glued
to
her
mouth
her
brother
confounded
at
the
rapid
words
could
scarcely
gather
in
their
sense
what
is
it
that
you
are
saying
joyce
he
asked
in
a
low
tone
i
do
not
i
have
longed
to
say
it
to
you
many
a
hundred
times
sir
but
it
is
right
that
you
should
hear
it
now
things
have
come
to
this
dreadful
ending
since
the
very
night
lady
isabel
came
home
here
your
wife
she
had
been
taunted
with
the
cost
she
has
brought
to
east
lynne
and
to
you
if
she
wanted
but
the
simplest
thing
she
was
forbidden
to
have
it
and
told
that
she
was
bringing
her
husband
to
poverty
for
this
very
dinner
party
that
she
went
to
she
wished
for
a
new
dress
and
your
cruel
words
ma
am
forbade
her
having
it
she
ordered
a
new
frock
for
miss
isabel
and
you
countermanded
it
you
have
told
her
that
master
worked
like
a
dog
to
support
her
extravagances
when
you
know
that
she
never
was
extravagant
that
none
were
less
inclined
to
go
beyond
proper
limits
than
she
i
have
seen
her
ma
am
come
away
from
your
reproaches
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
hands
meekly
clasped
upon
her
bosom
as
though
life
was
heavy
to
bear
a
lady
as
i
know
she
was
could
not
fail
to
be
driven
to
desperation
and
i
know
that
she
has
carlyle
turned
to
his
sister
can
this
be
true
he
inquired
in
a
tone
of
deep
agitation
she
did
not
answer
whether
it
was
the
shade
cast
by
the
nightcap
or
the
reflection
of
the
wax
taper
her
face
looked
of
a
green
cast
and
for
the
first
time
probably
in
miss
carlyle
s
life
her
words
failed
her
may
god
forgive
you
cornelia
he
muttered
as
he
went
out
of
the
chamber
he
descended
to
his
own
that
his
wife
had
laid
violent
hands
upon
herself
his
reason
utterly
repudiated
she
was
one
of
the
least
likely
to
commit
so
great
a
sin
he
believed
that
in
her
unhappiness
she
might
have
wandered
out
in
the
grounds
and
was
lingering
there
by
this
time
the
house
was
aroused
and
the
servants
were
astir
joyce
surely
a
supernatural
strength
was
given
her
for
though
she
had
been
able
to
put
her
foot
to
the
ground
she
had
not
yet
walked
upon
it
crept
downstairs
and
went
into
lady
isabel
s
carlyle
was
hastily
assuming
the
articles
of
attire
he
had
not
yet
put
on
to
go
out
and
search
the
grounds
when
joyce
limped
in
holding
out
a
note
joyce
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
that
night
i
found
this
in
the
drawer
sir
it
is
my
lady
s
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
address
archibald
though
a
calm
man
one
who
had
his
emotions
under
his
own
control
he
was
no
stoic
and
his
fingers
shook
as
he
broke
the
seal
when
years
go
on
and
my
children
ask
where
their
mother
is
and
why
she
left
them
tell
them
that
you
their
father
goaded
her
to
it
if
they
inquire
what
she
is
tell
them
also
if
you
so
will
but
tell
them
at
the
same
time
that
you
outraged
and
betrayed
her
driving
her
to
the
very
depth
of
desperation
ere
she
quitted
them
in
her
the
handwriting
his
wife
s
swam
before
the
eyes
of
carlyle
all
save
the
disgraceful
fact
that
she
had
flown
and
a
horrible
suspicion
began
to
dawn
upon
him
with
whom
was
totally
incomprehensible
how
had
he
outraged
her
in
what
manner
had
he
goaded
her
to
it
the
discomforts
alluded
to
by
joyce
and
the
work
of
his
sister
had
evidently
no
part
in
this
yet
what
had
he
done
he
read
the
letter
again
more
slowly
no
he
could
not
comprehend
it
he
had
not
the
clue
at
that
moment
the
voices
of
the
servants
in
the
corridor
outside
penetrated
his
ears
of
course
they
were
peering
about
and
making
their
own
comments
wilson
with
her
long
tongue
the
busiest
they
were
saying
that
captain
levison
was
not
in
his
room
that
his
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
joyce
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
she
could
not
stand
watching
her
master
with
a
blanched
face
never
had
she
seen
him
betray
agitation
so
powerful
not
the
faintest
suspicion
of
the
dreadful
truth
yet
dawned
upon
her
he
walked
to
the
door
the
open
note
in
his
hand
then
turned
wavered
and
stood
still
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
probably
he
did
not
then
he
took
out
his
put
the
note
inside
it
and
returned
it
to
his
pocket
his
hands
trembling
equally
with
his
livid
lips
you
need
not
mention
this
he
said
to
joyce
indicating
the
note
it
concerns
myself
sir
does
it
say
she
s
dead
she
is
not
dead
he
answered
worse
than
that
he
added
in
his
heart
why
who
s
this
uttered
joyce
it
was
little
isabel
stealing
in
with
a
frightened
face
in
her
white
nightgown
the
commotion
had
aroused
her
what
s
the
matter
she
asked
where
s
mamma
child
you
ll
catch
your
death
of
cold
said
joyce
go
back
to
but
i
want
in
the
morning
dear
evasively
returned
joyce
sir
please
must
not
isabel
go
back
to
bed
carlyle
made
no
reply
to
the
question
most
likely
he
never
heard
its
import
but
he
touched
isabel
s
shoulder
to
draw
joyce
s
attention
to
the
child
joyce
miss
lucy
in
he
left
the
room
and
joyce
remained
silent
from
amazement
she
heard
him
go
out
at
the
hall
door
and
bang
it
after
him
isabel
nay
we
must
say
lucy
also
went
and
stood
outside
the
chamber
door
the
servants
gathered
in
a
group
near
did
not
observe
her
presently
she
came
running
back
and
disturbed
joyce
from
her
reverie
joyce
is
it
true
is
what
true
my
dear
they
are
saying
that
captain
levison
has
taken
away
my
joyce
fell
back
in
her
chair
with
a
scream
it
changed
to
a
long
low
moan
of
anguish
what
has
he
taken
her
for
to
kill
her
i
thought
it
was
only
kidnappers
who
took
child
child
go
to
oh
joyce
i
want
mamma
when
will
she
come
back
joyce
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
to
conceal
its
emotion
from
the
motherless
child
and
just
then
miss
carlyle
entered
on
tiptoe
and
humbly
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
her
green
face
green
that
night
in
its
grief
its
remorse
and
its
horror
looking
nearly
as
dark
as
her
stockings
she
broke
into
a
subdued
wail
god
be
merciful
to
this
dishonored
house

into
the

between
twelve
and

in
spirits
he
having
won
nine
sixpences
and
his
friend
s
tap
of
ale
having
been
unusually
good
when
he
reached
his
bedroom
he
told

of
a
chaise
and
four
which
had
gone
tearing
past
at
a
furious
pace
as
he
was
closing
the
gate
coming
from
the
direction
of
east
lynne
he
wondered
where
it
could
be
going
at
that
midnight
hour
and
whom
it
contained

charming
results
nearly
a
year
went
by
lady
isabel
carlyle
had
spent
it
on
the
continent
that
refuge
for
such
fugitives
now
moving
about
from
place
to
place
with
her
companion
now
stationary
and
alone
quite
half
the
time
taking
one
absence
with
the
other
he
had
been
away
from
her
chiefly
in
paris
pursuing
his
own
course
and
his
own
pleasure
how
fared
it
with
lady
isabel
just
as
it
must
be
expected
to
fare
and
does
fare
when
a
gentlewoman
falls
from
her
pedestal
never
had
she
experienced
a
moment
s
calm
or
peace
or
happiness
since
the
fatal
night
of
quitting
her
home
she
had
taken
a
blind
leap
in
a
moment
of
wild
passion
when
instead
of
the
garden
of
roses
it
had
been
her
persuader
s
pleasure
to
promise
her
she
would
fall
into
but
which
in
truth
she
had
barely
glanced
at
for
that
had
not
been
her
moving
motive
she
had
found
herself
plunged
into
a
yawning
abyss
of
horror
from
which
there
was
never
more
any
escape
never
more
never
more
the
very
instant
the
very
night
of
her
departure
she
awoke
to
what
she
had
done
the
guilt
whose
aspect
had
been
shunned
in
the
prospective
assumed
at
once
its
true
frightful
color
the
blackness
of
darkness
and
a
lively
remorse
a
anguish
took
possession
of
her
soul
forever
oh
reader
believe
me
lady
wife
mother
should
you
ever
be
tempted
to
abandon
your
home
so
will
you
awake
whatever
trials
may
be
the
lot
of
your
married
life
though
they
may
magnify
themselves
to
your
crushed
spirit
as
beyond
the
nature
the
endurance
of
woman
to
bear
resolve
to
bear
them
fall
down
upon
your
knees
and
pray
to
be
enabled
to
bear
them
pray
for
patience
pray
for
strength
to
resist
the
demon
that
would
tempt
you
to
escape
bear
unto
death
rather
than
forfeit
your
fair
name
and
your
good
conscience
for
be
assured
that
the
alternative
if
you
do
rush
on
to
it
will
be
found
worse
than
death
poor
thing
poor
lady
isabel
she
had
sacrificed
husband
children
reputation
home
all
that
makes
life
of
value
to
woman
she
had
forfeited
her
duty
to
god
had
deliberately
broken
his
commandments
for
the
one
poor
miserable
mistake
of
flying
with
francis
levison
but
the
instant
the
step
was
irrevocable
the
instant
she
had
left
the
barrier
behind
repentance
set
in
even
in
the
first
days
of
her
departure
in
the
fleeting
moments
of
abandonment
when
it
may
be
supposed
she
might
momentarily
forget
conscience
it
was
sharply
wounding
her
with
its
adder
stings
and
she
knew
that
her
whole
future
existence
whether
spent
with
that
man
or
without
him
would
be
a
dark
course
of
gnawing
retribution
nearly
a
year
went
by
save
some
six
or
eight
weeks
when
one
morning
in
july
lady
isabel
made
her
appearance
in
the
they
were
staying
now
at
grenoble
taking
that
town
on
their
way
to
switzerland
through
savoy
it
had
been
captain
levison
s
pleasure
to
halt
in
it
he
engaged
apartments
furnished
in
the
vicinity
of
the
place
grenette
a
windy
old
house
it
was
full
of
doors
and
windows
chimneys
and
cupboards
and
he
said
he
should
remain
there
lady
isabel
remonstrated
she
wished
to
go
farther
on
where
they
might
get
quicker
news
from
england
but
her
will
now
was
as
nothing
she
was
looking
like
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
talk
of
her
having
looked
ill
when
she
took
that
voyage
over
the
water
with
carlyle
you
should
have
seen
her
now
misery
marks
the
countenance
worse
than
sickness
her
face
was
white
and
worn
her
hands
were
thin
her
eyes
were
sunken
and
surrounded
by
a
black
circle
care
was
digging
caves
for
them
a
stranger
might
have
attributed
these
signs
to
the
state
of
her
health
she
knew
that
they
were
the
effects
of
her
wretched
mind
and
heart
it
was
very
late
for
breakfast
but
why
should
she
rise
early
only
to
drag
through
another
endless
day
languidly
she
took
her
seat
at
the
table
just
as
captain
levison
s
servant
a
frenchman
whom
he
had
engaged
in
paris
entered
the
room
with
two
letters
point
de
gazette
pierre
she
said
non
and
all
the
time
the
sly
fox
had
got
the
times
in
his
coat
pocket
but
he
was
only
obeying
the
orders
of
his
master
it
had
been
captain
levison
s
recent
pleasure
that
the
newspapers
should
not
be
seen
by
lady
isabel
until
he
had
them
you
will
speedily
gather
his
motive
pierre
departed
toward
captain
levison
s
room
and
lady
isabel
took
up
the
letters
and
examined
their
superscription
with
interest
it
was
known
to
her
that
carlyle
had
not
lost
a
moment
in
seeking
a
divorce
and
the
announcement
that
it
was
granted
was
now
daily
expected
she
was
anxious
for
it
anxious
that
captain
levison
should
render
her
the
only
reparation
in
his
power
before
the
birth
of
her
unhappy
child
little
thought
she
that
there
was
not
the
least
intention
on
his
part
to
make
her
reparation
any
more
than
he
had
made
it
to
others
who
had
gone
before
her
she
had
become
painfully
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
man
for
whom
she
had
chosen
to
sacrifice
herself
was
bad
but
she
had
not
learned
all
his
badness
yet
captain
levison
unwashed
unshaven
with
a
loosely
flung
on
lounged
in
to
breakfast
the
dandies
before
the
world
are
frequently
the
greatest
slovens
in
domestic
privacy
he
wished
her
good
morning
in
a
careless
tone
of
apathy
and
she
as
apathetically
answered
to
it
pierre
says
there
are
some
letters
he
began
what
a
precious
hot
day
it
is
two
was
her
short
reply
her
tone
sullen
as
his
for
if
you
think
my
good
reader
that
the
flattering
words
the
ardent
expressions
which
usually
attend
the
first
of
these
promising
unions
last
out
a
whole
ten
months
you
are
in
egregious
error

very
opposite

supervened

before

you
don
t
believe

two
letters
she
continued
and
they
are
both
in
the
same
handwriting
your
solicitors
i
up
went
his
hand
at
the
last
word
and
he
made
a
sort
of
grab
at
the
letters
stalked
to
the
farthest
window
opened
it
and
glanced
over
its
contents

up
the

placed
it
securely
in
an
inner
pocket

any
news

asked
news
of
the
divorce
i
mean
tush
was
the
response
of
captain
levison
as
if
wishing
to
imply
that
the
divorce
was
yet
a
affair
and
he
proceeded
to
open
the
other
letter

sir
francis

the
outside
of
the
letter
was
superscribed
as

with
a
view
to
its
more
certain
delivery
at
last

the
gentleman

euphonious
expression
as
he
tossed
the
letter
open
on
the
the
divorce

granted
feverishly
uttered
lady
isabel
he
made
no
reply
but
seated
himself
to
breakfast

letter

for

few
days
ago

lady

up

letter
and

only

pierre
responded
and
departed
to
do
it
lady
isabel
waited
till
the
man
was
gone
and
then
spoke
a
faint
flush
of
emotion
in
her
cheeks
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
you
will
not
leave
me
yet

answered
there
s
a
mountain
of
business
to
be
attended
to
now
that
i
am
come
into
moss
grab
say
they
will
act
for
you
had
there
been
a
necessity
for
your
going
they
would
not
have
offered
ay
they
do
say
so
with
a
nice
eye
to
the
feathering
of
their
pockets
besides
i
should
not
choose
for
the
old
man
s
funeral
to
take
place
without
then
i
must
accompany
you
she
urged
i
wish
you
would
not
talk
nonsense
isabel
are
you
in
a
state
to
travel
night
and
day
neither
would
home
be
agreeable
to
you
yet
she
felt
the
force
of
the
objections
resuming
after
a
moment
s
pause
were
you
to
go
to
england
you
might
not
be
back
in
in
time
for
what
oh
how
can
you
ask
she
rejoined
in
a
sharp
tone
of
reproach
you
know
too
well
in
time
to
make
me
your
wife
when
the
divorce
shall
i
shall
chance
it
coolly
observed
sir
francis
chance
it
chance
the
legitimacy
of
the
child
you
must
assure
that
before
all
things
more
terrible
to
me
than
all
the
rest
would
it
be
if
now
don
t
put
yourself
in
a
fever
isabel
how
many
times
am
i
to
be
compelled
to
beg
that
of
you
it
does
no
good
is
it
my
fault
if
i
am
called
suddenly
to
england
have
you
no
pity
for
your
child
she
urged
in
agitation
nothing
can
repair
the
injury
if
you
once
suffer
it
to
come
upon
him
he
will
be
a
amidst
men
throughout
his
you
had
better
have
written
to
the
law
lords
to
urge
on
the
divorce
he
returned
i
can
not
help
the
there
has
been
no
delay
quite
the
contrary
but
it
may
be
expected
hourly
you
are
worrying
yourself
for
nothing
isabel
i
shall
be
back
in
he
quitted
the
room
as
he
spoke
and
lady
isabel
remained
in
it
the
image
of
despair
nearly
an
hour
elapsed
when
she
remembered
the
breakfast
things
and
rang
for
them
to
be
removed
a
entered
to
do
it
and
she
thought
how
ill
miladi
looked
where
is
pierre
miladi
asked
pierre
was
making
himself
ready
to
attend
monsieur
to
scarcely
had
she
closed
the
door
upon
herself
and
the
tray
when
sir
francis
levison
appeared
equipped
for
traveling
isabel
said
he
without
further
circumlocution
or
ceremony
lady
isabel
excited
beyond
all
slipped
the
bolt
of
the
door
and
half
leaning
against
it
half
leaning
at
his
feet
held
up
her
hand
in
supplication
francis
have
you
any
consideration
left
for
me
any
in
the
world
how
can
you
be
so
alarmed
isabel
of
course
i
have
he
continued
in
a
peevish
though
kind
tone
as
he
took
hold
of
her
hands
to
raise
her
no
not
yet
i
will
remain
here
until
you
say
you
will
wait
another
day
or
two
you
know
that
the
french
protestant
minister
is
prepared
to
marry
us
the
instant
news
of
the
divorce
shall
arrive
if
you
do
care
still
for
me
you
will
i
can
not
wait
he
replied
his
tone
changing
to
one
of
determination
it
is
useless
to
urge
he
broke
from
her
and
left
the
room
and
in
another
minute
had
left
the
house
pierre
attending
him
a
feeling
amounting
to
a
conviction
rushed
over
the
unhappy
lady
that
she
had
seen
him
for
the
last
time
until
it
was
too
late
she
was
right
it
was
too
late
by
weeks
and
months
december
came
in
the
alps
were
covered
with
snow
grenoble
borrowed
the
shade
and
looked
cold
and
white
and
sleety
and
sloppy
the
gutters
running
through
the
middle
of
certain
of
the
streets
were
unusually
black
and
the
people
crept
along
especially
dismal
close
to
the
fire
in
the
barn
of
a
french
bedroom
full
of
windows
and
doors
and
draughts
with
its
wide
hearth
and
its
wide
chimney
into
which
we
could
put
four
or
five
of
our
english
ones
shivered
lady
isabel
vane
she
had
an
invalid
cap
on
and
a
thick
woolen
invalid
shawl
and
she
shook
and
shivered
perpetually
though
she
had
drawn
so
close
to
the
wood
fire
that
there
was
a
danger
of
her
petticoats
igniting
and
the
attendant
had
frequently
to
spring
up
and
interpose
between
them
and
the
crackling
logs
little
did
it
seem
to
matter
to
lady
isabel
she
sat
in
one
position
her
countenance
the
picture
of
stony
despair
so
had
she
sat
so
looking
since
she
began
to
get
better
she
had
had
a
long
illness
terminating
in
a
low
fever
but
the
attendants
whispered
among
themselves
that
miladi
would
soon
get
about
if
she
would
only
rouse
herself
she
had
got
so
far
about
as
to
sit
up
in
the
windy
chamber
and
it
seemed
to
be
to
her
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
whether
she
ever
got
out
of
it
this
day
she
had
partaken
of
her
early
dinner
such
as
it
was
for
her
appetite
failed
and
had
dozed
asleep
in
the
arm
chair
when
a
noise
arose
from
below
like
a
carriage
driving
into
the
courtyard
through
the
porte
cochere
it
instantly
aroused
her
had
he
come
who
is
it
she
asked
of
the
nurse
miladi
it
is
monsieur
and
pierre
is
with
him
i
have
begged
milady
often
and
often
not
to
fret
for
monsieur
would
surely
come
miladi
see
i
am
the
girl
departed
closing
the
door
and
lady
isabel
sat
looking
at
it
schooling
her
patience
another
moment
and
it
was
flung
open
sir
francis
levison
approached
to
greet
her
as
he
came
in
she
waved
him
off
begging
him
in
a
subdued
quiet
tone
not
to
draw
too
near
as
any
little
excitement
made
her
faint
now
he
took
a
seat
opposite
to
her
and
began
pushing
the
logs
together
with
his
boot
as
he
explained
that
he
really
could
not
get
away
from
town
before
why
did
you
come
now
she
quietly
rejoined
why
did
i
come
repeated
he
are
these
all
the
thanks
a
fellow
gets
for
travelling
in
this
inclement
weather
i
thought
you
would
at
least
have
been
glad
to
welcome
me
sir
francis
she
rejoined
speaking
still
with
almost
unnatural
calmness
as
she
continued
to
do
throughout
the
interview
though
the
frequent
changes
in
her
countenance
and
the
movement
of
her
hands
when
she
laid
them
from
time
to
time
on
her
chest
to
keep
down
its
beating
told
what
effort
the
struggle
cost
her
sir
francis
i
am
glad
for
one
reason
to
welcome
you
we
must
come
to
an
understanding
one
with
the
other
and
so
far
i
am
pleased
that
you
are
here
it
was
my
intention
to
have
communicated
with
you
by
letter
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
capable
of
the
necessary
exertion
but
your
visit
has
removed
the
necessity
i
wish
to
deal
with
you
quite
unreservedly
without
concealment
or
deceit
i
must
request
you
so
to
deal
with
what
do
you
mean
by
deal
he
asked
settling
the
logs
to
his
apparent
satisfaction
to
speak
and
act
let
there
be
plain
truth
between
us
at
this
interview
if
there
never
has
been
i
don
t
understand
naked
truth
unglossed
over
she
pursued
bending
her
eyes
determinately
upon
him
it
must
with
all
my
heart
returned
sir
francis
it
is
you
who
have
thrown
out
the
challenge
when
you
left
in
july
you
gave
me
a
sacred
promise
to
come
back
in
time
for
our
marriage
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
in
time
but
of
course
i
meant
to
do
so
when
i
gave
the
promise
he
interrupted
but
no
sooner
had
i
set
my
foot
in
london
than
i
found
myself
overwhelmed
with
business
and
away
from
it
i
could
not
get
even
now
i
can
only
remain
with
you
a
couple
of
days
for
i
must
hasten
back
to
you
are
breaking
faith
already
she
said
after
hearing
him
calmly
to
the
end
your
words
are
not
words
of
truth
but
of
deceit
you
did
not
intend
to
be
back
in
time
for
the
marriage
or
otherwise
you
would
have
caused
it
to
take
place
ere
you
went
at
what
fancies
you
do
take
up
uttered
francis
levison
some
time
subsequent
to
your
departure
she
quietly
went
on
one
of
the
maids
was
setting
to
rights
the
clothes
in
your
and
she
brought
me
a
letter
she
found
in
one
of
the
pockets
i
saw
by
the
date
that
it
was
one
of
those
two
which
you
received
on
the
morning
of
your
departure
it
contained
the
information
that
the
divorce
was
she
spoke
so
quietly
so
apparently
without
feeling
or
passion
that
sir
francis
was
agreeably
astonished
he
should
have
less
trouble
in
throwing
off
the
mask
but
he
was
an
man
and
to
hear
that
the
letter
had
been
found
to
have
the
falseness
of
his
fine
protestations
and
promises
laid
bare
did
not
improve
his
temper
now
lady
isabel
continued
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
undeceived
me
then
to
have
told
me
that
the
hopes
i
was
cherishing
for
the
sake
of
the
unborn
child
were
worse
than
i
did
not
judge
so
he
replied
the
excited
state
you
then
appeared
to
be
in
would
have
precluded
your
listening
to
any
sort
of
her
heart
beat
a
little
quicker
but
she
stilled
it
you
deem
that
it
was
not
in
reason
that
i
should
aspire
to
be
the
wife
of
sir
francis
levison
he
rose
and
began
kicking
at
the
logs
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
this
time
well
isabel
you
must
be
aware
that
it
is
an
awful
sacrifice
for
a
man
in
my
position
to
marry
a
divorced
the
hectic
flushed
into
her
thin
cheeks
but
her
voice
sounded
calm
as
before
when
i
expected
or
wished
for
the
sacrifice
it
was
not
for
my
own
sake
i
told
you
so
then
but
it
was
not
made
and
the
child
s
inheritance
is
that
of
sin
and
shame
there
he
sir
francis
half
turned
to
where
she
pointed
and
saw
an
infant
s
cradle
by
the
side
of
the
bed
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
look
at
it
i
am
the
representative
now
of
an
ancient
and
respected
baronetcy
he
resumed
in
a
tone
as
of
apology
for
his
previous
heartless
words
and
to
make
you
my
wife
would
so
offend
all
my
family
that
stay
interrupted
lady
isabel
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
find
needless
excuses
had
you
taken
this
journey
for
the
purpose
of
making
me
your
wife
were
you
to
propose
to
do
so
this
day
and
bring
a
clergyman
into
the
room
to
perform
the
ceremony
it
would
be
futile
the
injury
to
the
child
can
never
be
repaired
and
for
myself
i
can
not
imagine
any
fate
in
life
worse
than
being
compelled
to
pass
it
with
if
you
have
taken
this
aversion
to
me
it
can
not
be
helped
he
coldly
said
inwardly
congratulating
himself
let
us
not
doubt
at
being
spared
the
work
of
trouble
he
had
anticipated
you
made
commotion
enough
once
about
me
making
you
she
shook
her
head
all
the
reparation
in
your
power
to
make
all
the
reparation
that
the
whole
world
can
invent
could
not
undo
my
sin
it
and
the
effects
must
lie
upon
me
oh
sin
was
the
derisive
exclamation
you
ladies
should
think
of
that
yes
she
sadly
answered
may
heaven
help
all
to
do
so
who
may
be
tempted
as
i
if
you
mean
that
as
a
reproach
to
me
it
s
rather
out
of
place
chafed
sir
francis
whose
fits
of
were
under
no
control
and
who
never
when
in
them
cared
what
he
said
to
outrage
the
feelings
of
another
the
temptation
to
sin
as
you
call
it
lay
not
in
my
persuasions
half
so
much
as
in
your
jealous
anger
toward
your
quite
true
was
her
reply
and
i
believe
you
were
on
the
wrong
scent
isabel
if
it
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
to
hear
it
since
we
are
mutually
on
this
complimentary
discourse
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
smooth
over
i
do
not
understand
what
you
would
imply
she
said
drawing
her
shawl
round
her
with
a
fresh
shiver
how
on
the
wrong
scent
with
regard
to
your
husband
and
that
hare
girl
you
were
blindly
outrageously
jealous
of
go
and
i
say
i
think
you
are
on
the
wrong
scent
i
do
not
believe
carlyle
ever
thought
of
the
girl
in
that
what
do
you
mean
she
gasped
they
had
a
secret
between
them
not
of
love
a
secret
of
business
and
those
interviews
they
had
together
her
dancing
attendance
upon
him
perpetually
related
to
that
and
that
her
face
was
more
flushed
than
it
had
been
throughout
the
interview
he
spoke
quietly
now
quite
in
an
equal
tone
of
reasoning
it
was
his
way
when
the
was
upon
him
and
the
calmer
he
spoke
the
more
cutting
were
his
words
he
need
not
have
told
her
this
what
was
the
secret
she
inquired
in
a
low
tone
nay
i
can
t
explain
all
they
did
not
take
me
into
their
confidence
they
did
not
even
take
you
better
perhaps
that
they
had
though
as
things
have
turned
out
or
seem
to
be
turning
there
s
some
disreputable
secret
attaching
to
the
hare
family
and
carlyle
was
acting
in
it
under
the
rose
for
hare
she
could
not
seek
out
carlyle
herself
so
she
sent
the
young
lady
that
s
all
i
how
did
you
know
it
i
had
reason
to
think
what
reason
i
must
request
you
to
tell
i
overheard
scraps
of
their
conversation
now
and
then
in
those
meetings
and
so
gathered
my
you
told
a
different
tale
to
me
sir
francis
was
her
remark
as
she
turned
her
indignant
eyes
toward
him
sir
francis
laughed
all
stratagems
are
fair
in
love
and
she
dared
not
immediately
trust
herself
to
reply
and
a
silence
ensued
sir
francis
broke
it
pointing
with
his
left
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
cradle
what
have
you
named
that
young
article
there
the
name
which
ought
to
have
been
his
by
inheritance
francis
levison
was
her
icy
answer
let
s
see
how
old
is
he
now
he
was
born
on
the
last
day
of
sir
francis
threw
up
his
arms
and
stretched
himself
as
if
a
fit
of
idleness
had
overtaken
him
then
advanced
to
the
cradle
and
pulled
down
the
clothes
who
is
he
like
isabel
my
handsome
self
were
he
like
you
in
spirit
i
would
pray
that
he
might
die
ere
he
could
speak
or
think
she
burst
forth
and
then
remembering
the
resolution
marked
out
for
herself
subsided
outwardly
into
calmness
again
what
else
retorted
sir
francis
you
know
my
disposition
pretty
well
by
this
time
isabel
and
may
be
sure
that
if
you
deal
out
small
change
to
me
you
will
get
it
back
again
with
she
made
no
reply
sir
francis
put
the
clothes
back
over
the
sleeping
child
returned
to
the
fire
and
stood
a
few
moments
with
his
back
to
it
is
my
room
prepared
for
me
do
you
know
he
presently
asked
no
it
is
not
she
quietly
rejoined
these
apartments
are
mine
now
they
have
been
transferred
into
my
name
and
they
can
never
again
afford
you
accommodation
will
you
be
so
obliging
i
am
not
strong
as
to
hand
me
that
writing
case
sir
francis
walked
to
the
table
she
indicated
which
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
great
barn
of
a
room
and
taking
the
from
it
gave
it
to
her
she
reached
her
keys
from
the
stand
at
her
elbow
unlocked
the
case
and
took
from
it
some
i
received
these
from
you
a
month
ago
she
said
they
came
by
and
never
had
the
grace
to
acknowledge
them
he
returned
in
a
sort
of
mock
reproachful
tone
forty
pounds
that
was
the
amount
was
it
not
i
believe
allow
me
to
return
them
to
you
count
return
them
to
me
for
what
inquired
sir
francis
in
amazement
i
have
no
longer
anything
whatever
to
do
with
you
in
any
way
do
not
make
my
arm
ache
holding
out
these
notes
to
you
so
long
take
them
sir
francis
took
the
notes
from
her
hand
and
placed
them
on
a
stand
near
to
her
if
it
be
your
wish
that
all
relations
should
end
between
us
why
let
it
be
so
he
said
i
must
confess
i
think
it
may
be
the
wisest
course
as
things
have
come
to
this
pass
for
a
cat
and
dog
life
which
would
seemingly
be
ours
is
not
agreeable
remember
though
that
it
is
your
doing
not
mine
but
you
can
not
think
i
am
going
to
see
you
starve
isabel
a
sum
we
will
fix
upon
the
amount
amicably
shall
be
placed
to
your
credit
and
i
beg
of
you
to
cease
she
passionately
interrupted
what
do
you
take
me
for
take
you
for
why
how
can
you
live
you
have
no
fortune
you
must
receive
assistance
from
some
i
will
not
receive
it
from
you
if
the
whole
world
denied
me
and
i
could
find
no
help
from
strangers
or
means
of
earning
my
own
bread
and
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
still
exist
i
would
apply
to
my
husband
for
means
rather
than
to
you
in
saying
this
it
ought
to
convince
you
that
the
topic
may
your
husband
sarcastically
rejoined
sir
francis
generous
man
a
flush
deep
and
painful
dyed
her
cheeks
i
should
have
said
my
late
husband
you
need
not
have
reminded
me
of
the
if
you
will
accept
nothing
for
yourself
you
must
for
the
child
he
at
any
rate
falls
to
my
share
i
shall
give
you
a
few
hundred
a
year
with
she
beat
her
hands
before
her
as
if
beating
off
the
man
and
his
words
not
a
farthing
now
or
ever
were
you
to
attempt
to
send
money
to
him
i
would
throw
it
into
the
nearest
river
whom
do
you
take
me
for
what
do
you
take
me
for
she
repeated
rising
in
her
bitter
mortification
if
you
have
put
me
beyond
the
pale
of
the
world
i
am
still
lord
mount
severn
s
daughter
you
did
as
much
toward
putting
yourself
beyond
its
pale
as
don
t
i
know
it
have
i
not
said
so
she
sharply
interrupted
and
then
she
sat
striving
to
calm
herself
clasping
together
her
shaking
hands
well
if
you
will
persist
in
this
perverse
resolution
i
can
not
mend
it
resumed
sir
francis
in
a
little
time
you
may
probably
wish
to
recall
it
in
which
case
a
line
addressed
to
me
at
my
banker
s
will
lady
isabel
drew
herself
up
put
away
those
notes
if
you
please
she
interrupted
not
allowing
him
to
finish
his
sentence
he
took
out
his
and
placed
the
bank
notes
within
it
your
clothes
those
you
left
here
when
you
went
to
england
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
order
pierre
to
take
away
this
afternoon
and
now
sir
francis
i
believe
that
is
all
we
will
to
remain
mortal
enemies
from
henceforth
is
that
to
be
it
to
be
strangers
she
replied
correcting
him
i
wish
you
a
good
so
you
will
not
even
shake
hands
with
me
isabel
i
would
prefer
and
thus
they
parted
sir
francis
left
the
room
but
not
immediately
the
house
he
went
into
a
distant
apartment
and
calling
the
servants
before
him
there
were
but
two
gave
them
each
a
year
s
wages
in
advance
that
they
might
not
have
to
trouble
miladi
for
money
he
said
to
them
then
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
landlord
and
handed
him
likewise
a
year
s
rent
in
advance
making
the
same
remark
after
that
he
ordered
dinner
at
a
hotel
and
the
same
night
he
and
pierre
departed
on
their
journey
home
again
sir
francis
thanking
his
lucky
star
that
he
had
so
easily
got
rid
of
a
vexatious
annoyance
and
lady
isabel
she
passed
her
evening
alone
sitting
in
the
same
place
close
to
the
fire
and
the
sparks
the
attendant
remonstrated
that
miladi
was
remaining
up
too
late
for
her
strength
but
miladi
ordered
her
and
her
remonstrances
into
an
adjoining
room
when
lady
isabel
lay
down
to
rest
she
sank
into
a
somewhat
calmer
sleep
than
she
had
known
of
late
also
into
a
dream
she
thought
she
was
back
at
east
lynne
not
back
in
one
sense
but
that
she
seemed
never
to
have
gone
away
from
it
walking
in
the
flower
garden
with
carlyle
while
the
three
children
played
on
the
lawn
her
arm
was
within
her
husband
s
and
he
was
relating
something
to
her
what
the
news
was
she
could
not
remember
afterward
excepting
that
it
was
connected
with
the
office
and
old
dill
and
that
carlyle
laughed
when
he
told
it
they
appeared
to
be
interrupted
by
the
crying
of
archibald
and
in
turning
to
the
lawn
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
she
awoke
alas
it
was
the
actual
crying
of
her
own
child
which
awoke
her
this
last
child
the
little
being
in
the
cradle
beside
her
but
for
a
single
instant
she
forgot
recent
events
and
doings
she
believed
she
was
indeed
in
her
happy
home
at
east
lynne
a
proud
woman
an
honored
wife
as
recollection
flashed
across
her
with
its
piercing
stings
she
gave
vent
to
a
sharp
cry
of
agony
of
unavailing
despair
chapter
xxvi
alone
for
evermore
a
surprise
awaited
lady
isabel
vane
it
was
on
a
windy
day
in
the
following
march
that
a
traveller
arrived
at
grenoble
and
inquired
his
way
of
a
porter
to
the
best
hotel
in
the
place
his
french
being
such
as
only
an
englishman
can
produce
hotel
let
s
see
returned
the
man
politely
but
with
native
indifference
there
are
two
hotels
nearly
contiguous
to
each
other
and
monsieur
would
find
himself
comfortable
at
either
there
is
the
tross
dauphins
and
there
is
the
monsieur
chose
haphazard
the
hotel
des
ambassadeurs
and
was
conducted
to
it
shortly
after
his
arrival
there
he
inquired
his
road
to
the
place
grenette
and
was
offered
to
be
shown
but
he
preferred
that
it
should
be
described
to
him
and
to
go
alone
the
place
was
found
and
he
thence
turned
to
the
apartments
of
lady
isabel
vane
lady
isabel
was
sitting
where
you
saw
her
the
previous
december
in
the
precise
spot
courting
the
warmth
of
the
fire
and
it
seemed
courting
the
sparks
also
for
they
appeared
as
fond
of
her
as
formerly
the
marvel
was
how
she
had
escaped
spontaneous
combustion
but
there
she
was
yet
and
her
clothes
likewise
you
might
think
that
but
a
night
had
passed
when
you
looked
at
the
room
for
it
wore
precisely
the
same
aspect
now
as
then
everything
was
the
same
even
to
the
child
s
cradle
in
the
remote
corner
partially
hidden
by
the
and
the
sleeping
child
in
it
lady
isabel
s
progress
toward
recovery
was
remarkably
lingering
as
is
frequently
the
case
when
mind
and
body
are
both
diseased
she
was
so
sitting
when
susanne
entered
the
room
and
said
that
a
monsieur
anglais
had
arrived
in
the
town
to
see
her
and
was
waiting
below
in
the
saloon
lady
isabel
was
startled
an
english
gentleman
to
see
her
english
for
certain
was
susanne
s
answer
for
she
had
difficulty
to
comprehend
his
french
who
could
be
desirous
to
see
her
one
out
of
the
world
and
forgotten
susanne
she
cried
aloud
a
thought
striking
her
it
is
never
sir
fran
it
is
not
monsieur
not
in
the
least
like
monsieur
complacently
answered
susanne
it
is
a
tall
brave
english
gentleman
proud
and
noble
looking
like
a
every
pulse
within
lady
isabel
s
body
throbbed
rebelliously
her
heart
bounded
till
it
was
like
to
burst
her
side
and
she
turned
sick
with
astonishment
tall
brave
noble
could
that
description
apply
to
any
but
carlyle
strange
that
so
unnatural
an
idea
should
have
occurred
to
her
it
would
not
have
done
so
in
a
calmer
moment
she
rose
tottered
across
the
chamber
and
prepared
to
descend
susanne
s
tongue
was
let
loose
at
the
proceeding
was
miladi
out
of
her
senses
to
attempt
going
downstairs
would
be
a
pretty
ending
for
she
d
surely
fall
by
the
way
miladi
knew
that
the
bottom
step
was
of
lead
and
that
no
head
could
pitch
down
upon
that
without
ever
never
being
a
head
any
more
except
in
the
hospitals
let
miladi
sit
still
in
her
place
and
she
d
bring
the
monsieur
up
what
did
it
signify
he
was
not
a
young
petit
maitre
to
quiz
things
he
was
fifty
if
he
was
a
day
his
hair
already
turned
to
fine
this
set
the
question
touching
carlyle
at
rest
and
her
heart
stilled
again
the
next
moment
she
was
inwardly
laughing
in
her
bitter
mockery
at
her
insensate
folly
carlyle
come
to
see
her
her
francis
levison
might
be
sending
over
some
man
of
business
regarding
the
money
question
was
her
next
thought
if
so
she
should
certainly
refuse
to
see
him
go
down
to
the
gentleman
and
ask
him
his
name
susanne
ask
also
from
whence
he
susanne
disappeared
and
returned
and
the
gentleman
behind
her
whether
she
had
invited
him
or
whether
he
had
chosen
to
come
uninvited
there
he
was
lady
isabel
caught
a
glimpse
and
flung
her
hands
over
her
burning
cheeks
of
shame
it
was
lord
mount
severn
how
did
you
find
out
where
i
was
she
gasped
when
some
painful
words
had
been
uttered
on
both
sides
i
went
to
sir
francis
levison
and
demanded
your
address
certain
recent
events
implied
that
he
and
you
must
have
parted
and
i
therefore
deemed
it
time
to
inquire
what
he
had
done
with
since
last
july
she
interrupted
lifting
up
her
wan
face
now
colorless
again
do
not
think
worse
of
me
than
i
am
he
was
here
in
december
for
an
hour
s
recriminating
interview
and
we
parted
for
what
have
you
heard
of
him
lately
not
anything
i
never
know
what
is
passing
in
the
world
at
home
i
have
no
newspaper
no
correspondence
and
he
would
scarcely
be
so
bold
as
to
write
to
me
i
shall
not
shock
you
then
by
some
tidings
i
bring
you
regarding
him
returned
lord
mount
severn
the
greatest
shock
to
me
would
be
to
hear
that
i
should
ever
again
be
subjected
to
the
sight
of
him
she
answered
he
is
heaven
have
pity
on
his
poor
wife
was
all
the
comment
of
lady
isabel
he
has
married
alice
she
lifted
her
head
then
in
simple
surprise
alice
not
blanche
the
story
runs
that
he
has
played
blanche
very
false
that
he
has
been
with
her
much
during
the
last
three
or
four
months
leading
on
her
expectations
and
then
suddenly
proposed
for
her
younger
sister
i
know
nothing
of
the
details
myself
it
is
not
likely
and
i
heard
nothing
until
one
evening
at
the
club
i
saw
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
for
the
following
day
at
george
s
i
was
at
the
church
the
next
morning
before
he
not
to
stop
it
not
to
intercept
the
marriage
breathlessly
uttered
the
lady
isabel
certainly
not
i
had
no
power
to
attempt
anything
of
the
sort
i
went
to
demand
an
answer
to
my
question
what
he
had
done
with
you
and
where
you
were
he
gave
me
this
address
but
said
he
knew
nothing
of
your
movements
since
there
was
a
long
silence
the
earl
appeared
to
be
alternately
ruminating
and
taking
a
survey
of
the
room
isabel
sat
with
her
head
down
why
did
you
seek
me
out
she
presently
broke
forth
i
am
not
worth
it
i
have
brought
enough
disgrace
upon
your
and
upon
your
husband
s
and
upon
your
children
s
he
rejoined
in
the
most
severe
manner
for
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
the
earl
of
mount
severn
to
gloss
over
guilt
nevertheless
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
as
your
nearest
blood
relative
to
see
after
you
now
that
you
are
alone
again
and
to
take
care
as
far
as
i
can
that
you
do
not
lapse
he
might
have
spared
her
that
stab
but
she
scarcely
understood
him
she
looked
at
him
wondering
whether
she
did
understand
you
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
he
resumed
how
do
you
propose
to
live
i
have
some
money
yet
when
his
money
sharply
and
haughtily
interposed
the
earl
no
she
indignantly
replied
i
am
selling
my
trinkets
before
they
are
all
gone
i
shall
look
out
to
get
a
living
in
some
way
by
teaching
trinkets
repeated
lord
mount
severn
mr
carlyle
told
me
that
you
carried
nothing
away
with
you
from
east
nothing
that
he
had
given
me
these
were
mine
before
i
married
you
have
seen
carlyle
then
she
faltered
seen
him
echoed
the
indignant
earl
when
such
a
blow
was
dealt
him
by
a
member
of
my
family
could
i
do
less
than
hasten
to
east
lynne
to
tender
my
sympathies
i
went
with
another
subject
too
to
discover
what
could
have
been
the
moving
springs
of
your
conduct
for
i
protest
when
the
black
tidings
reached
me
i
believed
that
you
must
have
gone
mad
you
were
one
of
the
last
whom
i
should
have
feared
to
trust
but
i
learned
nothing
and
carlyle
was
as
ignorant
as
i
how
could
you
strike
him
such
a
blow
lower
and
lower
drooped
her
head
brighter
shone
the
shame
on
her
hectic
cheek
an
awful
blow
to
carlyle
it
must
have
been
she
was
feeling
it
in
all
its
bitter
intensity
lord
mount
severn
read
her
repentant
looks
isabel
he
said
in
a
tone
which
had
lost
something
of
its
harshness
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
called
her
by
her
christian
name
i
see
that
you
are
reaping
the
fruits
tell
me
how
it
happened
what
demon
prompted
you
to
sell
yourself
to
that
bad
man
he
is
a
bad
man
she
exclaimed
a
base
heartless
man
i
warned
you
at
the
commencement
of
your
married
life
to
avoid
him
to
shun
all
association
with
him
not
to
admit
him
to
your
his
coming
to
east
lynne
was
not
my
doing
she
whispered
mr
carlyle
invited
i
know
he
did
invited
him
in
his
unsuspicious
confidence
believing
his
wife
to
be
his
wife
a
trustworthy
woman
of
honor
was
the
severe
remark
she
did
not
reply
she
could
not
gainsay
it
she
only
sat
with
her
meek
face
of
shame
and
her
eyelids
drooping
if
ever
a
woman
had
a
good
husband
in
every
sense
of
the
word
you
had
in
carlyle
if
ever
man
loved
his
wife
he
loved
you
how
could
you
so
requite
him
she
rolled
in
a
confused
manner
the
corners
of
her
warm
shawl
over
her
unconscious
fingers
i
read
the
note
you
left
for
your
husband
he
showed
it
to
me
the
only
one
i
believe
to
whom
he
did
show
it
it
was
to
him
entirely
inexplicable
it
was
so
to
me
a
notion
had
been
suggested
to
him
after
your
departure
that
his
sister
had
somewhat
marred
your
peace
at
east
lynne
and
he
blamed
you
much
if
it
was
so
for
not
giving
him
your
full
confidence
on
the
point
that
he
might
set
matters
on
the
right
footing
but
it
was
impossible
and
there
was
the
evidence
in
the
note
besides
that
the
presence
of
miss
carlyle
at
east
lynne
could
be
any
excuse
for
your
disgracing
us
all
and
ruining
do
not
let
us
speak
of
these
things
said
lady
isabel
faintly
it
can
not
redeem
the
but
i
must
speak
of
them
i
came
to
speak
of
them
persisted
the
earl
i
could
not
do
it
as
long
as
that
man
was
here
when
these
inexplicable
things
take
place
in
the
career
of
a
woman
it
is
a
father
s
duty
to
look
into
motives
and
causes
and
actions
although
the
events
in
themselves
may
be
as
in
this
case
irreparable
your
father
is
gone
but
i
stand
in
his
place
there
is
no
one
else
to
stand
in
her
tears
began
to
fall
and
she
let
them
fall
in
silence
the
earl
resumed
but
for
that
extraordinary
letter
i
should
have
supposed
you
had
been
actuated
by
a
mad
infatuation
for
the
cur
levison
its
tenor
gave
the
matter
a
different
aspect
to
what
did
you
allude
when
you
asserted
that
your
husband
had
driven
you
to
it
he
knew
she
answered
scarcely
above
her
breath
he
did
not
know
sternly
replied
the
earl
a
more
truthful
honorable
man
than
carlyle
does
not
exist
on
the
face
of
the
earth
when
he
told
me
then
in
his
agony
of
grief
that
he
was
unable
to
form
even
a
suspicion
of
your
meaning
i
could
have
staked
my
earldom
on
his
veracity
i
would
stake
it
i
believed
she
began
in
a
low
nervous
voice
for
she
knew
that
there
was
no
evading
the
questions
of
lord
mount
severn
when
he
was
resolute
in
their
being
answered
and
indeed
she
was
too
weak
both
in
body
and
spirit
to
resist
i
believed
that
his
love
was
no
longer
mine
that
he
had
deserted
me
for
the
earl
stared
at
her
what
can
you
mean
by
deserted
he
was
with
there
is
a
desertion
of
the
heart
was
her
murmured
answer
desertion
of
a
fiddlestick
retorted
his
lordship
the
interpretation
we
gave
to
the
note
i
and
carlyle
was
that
you
had
been
actuated
by
motives
of
jealousy
had
penned
it
in
a
jealous
mood
i
put
the
question
to
carlyle
as
between
man
and
man
do
you
listen
isabel
whether
he
had
given
you
cause
and
he
answered
me
as
with
god
over
us
he
had
never
given
you
cause
he
had
been
faithful
to
you
in
thought
word
and
deed
he
had
never
so
far
as
he
could
call
to
mind
even
looked
upon
another
woman
with
covetous
feelings
since
the
hour
that
he
made
you
his
wife
his
whole
thoughts
had
been
of
you
and
of
you
alone
it
is
more
than
many
a
husband
can
say
significantly
coughed
lord
mount
severn
her
pulses
were
beating
wildly
a
powerful
conviction
that
the
words
were
true
that
her
own
blind
jealousy
had
been
utterly
mistaken
and
unfounded
was
forcing
its
way
to
her
brain
after
that
i
could
only
set
your
letter
down
as
a
subterfuge
resumed
the
earl
a
false
barefaced
plea
put
forth
to
conceal
your
real
motives
and
i
told
carlyle
so
i
inquired
how
it
was
he
had
never
detected
any
secret
understanding
between
you
and
that
that
beast
located
as
the
fellow
was
in
the
house
he
replied
that
no
such
suspicion
had
ever
occurred
to
him
he
placed
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
you
and
would
have
trusted
you
with
the
creature
around
the
world
aye
with
any
one
she
entwined
her
hands
one
within
the
other
pressing
them
to
pain
it
would
not
deaden
the
pain
at
her
heart
carlyle
told
me
he
had
been
unusually
occupied
during
the
stay
of
that
man
besides
his
customary
office
work
his
time
was
taken
up
with
some
private
business
for
a
family
in
the
neighborhood
and
he
had
repeatedly
to
see
them
more
particularly
the
daughter
after
office
hours
very
old
acquaintances
of
his
he
said
relatives
of
the
carlyle
family
and
he
was
as
anxious
about
the
secret
a
painful
one
as
they
were
this
i
observed
to
him
may
have
rendered
him
unobservant
to
what
was
passing
at
home
he
told
me
i
remember
that
on
the
very
evening
of
the
the
catastrophe
he
ought
to
have
gone
with
you
to
a
dinner
party
but
most
important
circumstances
arose
in
connection
with
the
affair
which
obliged
him
to
meet
two
gentlemen
at
his
office
and
to
receive
them
in
secret
unknown
to
his
did
he
mention
the
name
of
the
family
inquired
lady
isabel
with
white
lips
yes
he
did
i
forgot
it
though
rabbit
rabit
some
such
name
as
was
it
hare
that
was
it
hare
he
said
you
appeared
vexed
that
he
did
not
accompany
you
to
the
dinner
and
seeing
that
he
intended
to
go
in
afterward
but
was
prevented
when
the
interview
was
over
in
his
office
he
was
again
detained
at
hare
s
house
and
by
business
as
impossible
to
avoid
as
the
important
business
she
echoed
giving
way
for
a
moment
to
the
bitterness
of
former
feelings
he
was
promenading
in
their
garden
by
moonlight
with
barbara
miss
hare
i
saw
them
as
my
carriage
and
you
were
jealous
that
he
should
be
there
exclaimed
lord
mount
severn
with
mocking
reproach
as
he
detected
her
mood
listen
he
whispered
bending
his
head
toward
her
while
you
may
have
thought
as
your
present
tone
would
seem
to
intimate
that
they
were
pacing
there
to
enjoy
each
other
s
society
know
that
they
carlyle
at
any
rate
was
pacing
the
walk
to
keep
guard
one
was
within
that
house
for
a
short
half
hour
s
interview
with
his
poor
mother
one
who
lives
in
danger
of
the
scaffold
to
which
his
own
father
would
be
the
first
to
deliver
him
up
they
were
keeping
the
path
against
that
father
carlyle
and
the
young
lady
of
all
the
nights
in
the
previous
seven
years
that
one
only
saw
the
unhappy
son
at
home
for
a
half
hour
s
meeting
with
his
mother
and
sister
carlyle
in
the
grief
and
excitement
caused
by
your
conduct
confided
so
much
to
me
when
mentioning
what
kept
him
from
the
dinner
her
face
had
become
crimson
crimson
at
her
past
lamentable
folly
and
there
was
no
redemption
but
he
was
always
with
barbara
hare
she
murmured
by
way
of
some
faint
excuse
i
have
mentioned
so
she
had
to
see
him
upon
this
affair
her
mother
could
not
for
it
was
obliged
to
be
kept
from
the
father
and
so
you
construed
business
interviews
into
assignations
continued
lord
mount
severn
with
cutting
derision
i
had
given
you
credit
for
better
sense
but
was
this
enough
to
hurl
you
on
the
step
you
took
surely
not
you
must
have
yielded
in
the
persuasions
of
that
wicked
it
is
all
over
now
she
wailed
carlyle
was
true
and
faithful
to
you
and
to
you
alone
few
women
have
the
chance
of
happiness
in
their
married
life
in
the
degree
that
you
had
he
is
an
upright
and
good
man
one
of
nature
s
gentlemen
one
that
england
may
be
proud
of
as
having
grown
upon
her
soil
the
more
i
see
of
him
the
greater
becomes
my
admiration
of
him
and
of
his
thorough
honor
do
you
know
what
he
did
in
the
matter
of
the
damages
she
shook
her
head
he
did
not
wish
to
proceed
for
damages
or
only
for
the
trifling
sum
demanded
by
law
but
the
jury
feeling
for
his
wrongs
gave
unprecedently
heavy
ones
since
the
fellow
came
into
his
baronetcy
they
have
been
paid
carlyle
immediately
handed
them
over
to
the
county
hospital
he
holds
the
apparently
obsolete
opinion
that
money
can
not
wipe
out
a
wife
s
let
us
close
those
topics
implored
the
poor
invalid
i
acted
wickedly
and
madly
and
have
the
consequences
to
bear
forever
more
i
can
not
where
do
you
intend
to
fix
your
future
residence
inquired
the
earl
i
am
unable
to
tell
i
shall
leave
this
town
as
soon
as
i
am
well
aye
it
can
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
remain
under
the
eyes
of
its
inhabitants
you
were
here
with
him
were
you
not
they
think
i
am
his
wife
she
murmured
the
servants
think
that
s
well
so
far
how
many
servants
have
you
two
i
am
not
strong
enough
yet
to
do
much
myself
so
am
obliged
to
keep
two
she
continued
as
if
in
apology
for
the
extravagance
under
her
reduced
circumstances
as
soon
as
ever
the
baby
can
walk
i
shall
manage
to
do
with
the
earl
looked
confounded
the
baby
he
uttered
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
and
grief
painful
to
her
to
hear
isabel
is
there
a
child
not
less
painful
was
her
own
emotion
as
she
hid
her
face
lord
mount
severn
rose
and
paced
the
room
with
striding
steps
i
did
not
know
it
i
did
not
know
it
wicked
heartless
villain
he
ought
to
have
married
you
before
its
birth
was
the
divorce
out
previously
he
asked
stopping
short
in
his
strides
to
put
the
question
coward
sneak
may
good
men
shun
him
from
henceforth
may
his
queen
refuse
to
receive
him
you
an
earl
s
daughter
oh
isabel
how
utterly
you
have
lost
yourself
lady
isabel
started
from
her
chair
in
a
burst
of
hysterical
sobs
her
hands
extended
beseechingly
toward
the
earl
spare
me
spare
me
you
have
been
rending
my
heart
ever
since
you
came
indeed
i
am
too
weak
to
bear
the
earl
in
truth
had
been
betrayed
into
showing
more
of
his
sentiments
than
he
intended
he
recalled
his
recollection
well
well
sit
down
again
isabel
he
said
putting
her
into
her
chair
we
shall
go
to
the
point
i
chiefly
came
here
to
settle
what
sum
will
it
take
you
to
live
upon
quietly
as
of
course
you
would
now
wish
to
live
but
i
will
not
accept
anything
she
replied
i
will
get
my
own
and
the
earl
s
irascibility
again
arose
at
the
speech
he
spoke
in
a
sharp
tone
absurd
isabel
do
not
add
romantic
folly
to
your
own
mistakes
get
your
own
living
indeed
as
much
as
is
necessary
for
you
to
live
upon
i
shall
supply
no
remonstrance
i
tell
you
i
am
acting
as
for
your
father
do
you
suppose
he
would
have
abandoned
you
to
starve
or
to
work
the
allusion
touched
every
chord
within
her
bosom
and
the
tears
fell
fast
i
thought
i
could
get
my
living
by
teaching
she
sobbed
and
how
much
did
you
anticipate
the
teaching
would
bring
you
in
not
very
much
she
listlessly
said
a
hundred
a
year
perhaps
i
am
very
clever
at
music
and
singing
that
sum
might
keep
us
i
fancy
even
if
i
only
went
out
by
the
and
a
fine
keep
it
would
be
you
shall
have
that
sum
every
quarter
no
no
no
no
i
do
not
deserve
it
i
could
not
accept
it
i
have
forfeited
all
claim
to
not
to
mine
now
it
is
of
no
use
to
excite
yourself
my
mind
is
made
up
i
never
willingly
forego
a
duty
and
i
look
upon
this
not
only
as
a
duty
but
as
an
imperative
one
upon
my
return
i
shall
immediately
settle
four
hundred
upon
you
and
you
can
draw
it
then
half
that
sum
she
reflected
knowing
how
useless
it
was
to
contend
with
lord
mount
severn
when
he
got
upon
the
stilts
of
indeed
two
hundred
a
year
will
be
ample
it
will
seem
like
riches
to
i
have
named
the
sum
isabel
and
i
shall
not
make
it
less
a
hundred
pounds
every
three
months
shall
be
paid
to
you
dating
from
this
day
this
does
not
count
said
he
laying
down
some
notes
on
the
table
he
took
her
hand
within
his
in
token
of
farewell
turned
and
was
gone
and
lady
isabel
remained
in
her
chamber
alone
alone
alone
alone
for
evermore
chapter
xxvii
barbara
s
misdoings
a
sunny
afternoon
in
summer
more
correctly
speaking
it
may
be
said
a
summer
s
evening
for
the
bright
beams
were
already
slanting
athwart
the
substantial
garden
of
justice
hare
and
the
tea
hour
seven
was
passing
and
hare
and
barbara
were
seated
at
the
meal
somehow
meals
always
did
seem
in
process
at
justice
hare
s
if
it
was
not
breakfast
it
was
luncheon
if
it
was
not
luncheon
it
was
dinner
if
it
was
not
dinner
it
was
tea
barbara
sat
in
tears
for
the
justice
was
giving
her
a
piece
of
his
mind
and
poor
hare
deferently
agreeing
with
her
husband
as
she
would
have
done
had
he
proposed
to
set
the
house
on
fire
and
burn
her
up
in
it
yet
sympathizing
with
barbara
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
you
do
it
for
the
purpose
you
do
it
to
anger
me
thundered
the
justice
bringing
down
his
hand
on
the
and
causing
the
cups
to
rattle
no
i
don
t
papa
sobbed
barbara
then
why
do
you
do
it
barbara
was
silent
no
you
can
t
answer
you
have
nothing
to
urge
what
is
the
matter
pray
with
major
thorn
come
i
will
be
i
don
t
like
him
faltered
barbara
you
do
like
him
you
are
telling
me
an
untruth
you
have
liked
him
well
enough
whenever
he
has
been
i
like
him
as
an
acquaintance
papa
not
as
a
not
as
a
husband
repeated
the
exasperated
justice
why
bless
my
heart
and
body
the
girl
s
going
mad
not
as
a
husband
who
asked
you
to
like
him
as
a
husband
before
he
became
such
did
ever
you
hear
that
it
was
necessary
or
expedient
or
becoming
for
a
young
lady
to
act
on
and
begin
to
like
a
gentleman
as
her
husband
barbara
felt
a
little
bewildered
here
s
the
whole
parish
saying
that
barbara
hare
can
t
be
married
that
nobody
will
have
her
on
account
of
of
of
that
cursed
stain
left
by
i
won
t
trust
myself
to
name
him
i
should
go
too
far
now
don
t
you
think
that
s
a
pretty
disgrace
a
fine
state
of
things
but
it
is
not
true
said
barbara
people
do
ask
but
what
s
the
use
of
their
asking
when
you
say
no
raved
the
justice
is
that
the
way
to
let
the
parish
know
that
they
ask
you
are
an
ungrateful
rebellious
daughter
and
you
ll
never
be
barbara
s
tears
flowed
freely
the
justice
gave
a
dash
at
the
bell
handle
to
order
the
tea
things
carried
away
and
after
their
removal
the
subject
was
renewed
together
with
barbara
s
grief
that
was
the
worst
of
justice
hare
let
him
seize
hold
of
a
grievance
it
was
not
often
he
got
upon
a
real
one
and
he
kept
on
at
it
like
a
blacksmith
hammering
at
his
forge
in
the
midst
of
a
stormy
oration
tongue
and
hands
going
together
carlyle
came
in
not
much
altered
not
much
a
year
and
had
gone
by
and
they
had
served
to
silver
his
hair
upon
the
temples
his
manner
too
would
never
again
be
careless
and
light
as
it
once
had
been
he
was
the
same
keen
man
of
business
the
same
pleasant
intelligent
companion
the
generality
of
people
saw
no
change
in
him
barbara
rose
to
escape
no
said
justice
hare
planting
himself
between
her
and
the
door
that
s
the
way
you
like
to
get
out
of
my
reach
when
i
am
talking
to
you
you
won
t
go
so
sit
down
again
i
ll
tell
you
of
your
before
carlyle
and
see
if
that
will
shame
barbara
resumed
her
seat
a
rush
of
crimson
dyeing
her
cheeks
and
carlyle
looked
inquiringly
seeming
to
ask
an
explanation
of
her
distress
the
justice
continued
after
his
own
fashion
you
know
carlyle
that
horrible
blow
that
fell
upon
us
that
shameless
disgrace
well
because
the
parish
can
t
clack
enough
about
the
fact
itself
it
must
begin
about
barbara
saying
that
the
disgrace
and
humiliation
are
reflected
upon
her
and
that
nobody
will
come
near
her
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
one
would
think
rather
than
lie
under
the
stigma
and
afford
the
parish
room
to
talk
she
d
marry
the
first
man
that
came
if
it
was
the
parish
beadle
anybody
else
would
but
now
what
are
the
facts
you
ll
stare
when
you
know
them
she
has
received
a
bushel
of
good
offers
a
bushel
of
them
repeated
the
justice
dashing
his
hand
down
on
his
knee
and
she
says
no
to
all
the
last
was
day
from
major
thorn
and
my
young
lady
takes
and
puts
the
stopper
upon
it
as
usual
without
reference
to
me
or
her
mother
without
saying
with
your
leave
or
by
your
leave
she
wants
to
be
kept
in
her
room
for
a
week
upon
bread
and
water
to
bring
her
to
her
carlyle
glanced
at
barbara
she
was
sitting
meekly
under
the
infliction
her
wet
eyelashes
falling
on
her
flushed
cheeks
and
shading
her
eyes
the
justice
was
heated
enough
and
had
pushed
his
flaxen
wig
nearly
before
in
the
warmth
of
his
argument
what
did
you
say
to
her
snapped
the
justice
matrimony
may
not
have
charms
for
barbara
replied
carlyle
half
jokingly
nothing
does
have
charms
for
her
that
ought
to
have
growled
justice
hare
she
s
one
of
the
contrary
ones
by
the
way
though
hastily
resumed
the
justice
leaving
the
objectionable
subject
as
another
flashed
across
his
memory
they
were
coupling
your
name
and
matrimony
together
carlyle
last
night
at
the
buck
s
a
very
perceptible
tinge
of
red
rose
to
the
face
of
carlyle
telling
of
inward
emotion
but
his
voice
and
manner
betrayed
none
indeed
he
carelessly
said
ah
you
are
a
sly
one
you
are
carlyle
remember
how
sly
you
were
over
your
first
marriage
justice
hare
was
going
to
bring
out
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
all
circumstances
considered
it
was
not
precisely
the
topic
to
recall
to
carlyle
so
he
stopped
himself
in
the
utterance
coughed
and
went
on
again
there
you
go
over
to
see
sir
john
dobede
not
to
see
sir
john
but
paying
court
to
miss
so
the
buck
s
head
was
amusing
itself
with
that
observed
carlyle
well
miss
dobede
is
going
to
be
married
and
i
am
drawing
up
the
it
s
not
she
she
marries
young
somerset
everybody
knows
that
it
s
the
other
one
louisa
a
nice
girl
very
responded
carlyle
and
it
was
all
the
answer
he
gave
the
justice
tired
of
sitting
indoors
tired
perhaps
of
extracting
nothing
satisfactory
from
carlyle
rose
shook
himself
set
his
wig
aright
before
the
and
quitted
the
house
on
his
customary
evening
visit
to
the
buck
s
head
barbara
who
watched
him
down
the
path
saw
that
he
encountered
someone
who
happened
to
be
passing
the
gate
she
could
not
at
first
distinguish
who
it
might
be
nothing
but
an
arm
and
shoulder
cased
in
velveteen
met
her
view
but
as
their
positions
changed
in
conversation
his
and
her
father
s
she
saw
that
it
was
locksley
he
had
been
the
chief
witness
not
a
vindictive
one
he
could
not
help
himself
against
her
brother
richard
touching
the
murder
of
hallijohn
meanwhile
hare
had
drawn
carlyle
into
a
chair
close
by
her
own
archibald
will
you
forgive
me
if
i
say
a
word
upon
the
topic
introduced
by
hare
she
said
in
a
low
tone
as
she
shook
his
hand
you
know
how
fondly
i
have
ever
regarded
you
second
only
to
my
poor
richard
your
welfare
and
happiness
are
precious
to
me
i
wish
i
could
in
any
way
promote
them
it
occurs
to
me
sometimes
that
you
are
not
at
present
so
happy
as
you
might
i
have
some
sources
of
happiness
said
carlyle
my
children
and
i
have
plenty
of
sources
of
interest
what
do
you
mean
dear
hare
your
home
might
be
made
carlyle
smiled
nearly
laughed
cornelia
takes
care
of
that
as
she
did
in
the
old
days
you
yes
i
know
would
it
not
be
as
well
to
consider
whether
she
would
not
be
better
in
a
home
of
her
own
and
for
you
to
give
east
lynne
another
mistress
he
shook
his
head
archibald
it
would
be
happier
for
you
it
would
indeed
it
is
only
in
new
ties
that
you
can
forget
the
past
you
might
find
recompense
yet
for
the
sorrow
you
have
gone
through
and
i
know
none
repeated
hare
emphatically
more
calculated
to
bring
it
you
than
that
sweet
girl
louisa
so
long
as
carlyle
was
beginning
and
had
not
got
so
far
in
his
sentence
when
he
was
interrupted
by
an
exclamation
from
barbara
what
can
be
the
matter
with
papa
locksley
must
have
said
something
to
anger
him
he
is
coming
in
the
greatest
passion
mamma
his
face
crimson
and
his
hands
and
arms
oh
dear
barbara
was
all
poor
hare
s
reply
the
justice
s
great
bursts
of
passion
frightened
her
in
he
came
closed
the
door
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
alternately
at
hare
and
barbara
what
is
this
cursed
report
that
s
being
whispered
in
the
place
quoth
he
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
rage
but
not
unmixed
with
awe
what
report
asked
carlyle
for
the
justice
waited
for
an
answer
and
hare
seemed
unable
to
speak
barbara
took
care
to
keep
silence
she
had
some
misgivings
that
the
justice
s
words
might
be
referring
to
herself
to
the
recent
grievance
a
report
that
he
he
has
been
here
disguised
as
a
laborer
has
dared
to
show
himself
in
the
place
where
he
ll
come
yet
to
the
hare
s
face
turned
as
white
as
death
carlyle
rose
and
dexterously
contrived
to
stand
before
her
so
that
it
should
not
be
seen
barbara
silently
locked
her
hands
one
within
the
other
and
turned
to
the
window
of
whom
did
you
speak
asked
carlyle
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
putting
the
most
question
he
knew
too
well
but
he
thought
to
temporize
for
the
sake
of
hare
of
whom
do
i
speak
uttered
the
exasperated
justice
nearly
beside
himself
with
passion
of
whom
would
i
speak
but
the
bastard
dick
who
else
in
west
lynne
is
likely
to
come
to
a
felon
s
death
oh
richard
sobbed
forth
hare
as
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
be
merciful
he
is
our
own
true
never
a
true
son
of
the
hares
raved
the
justice
a
true
son
of
wickedness
and
cowardice
and
blight
and
evil
if
he
has
dared
to
show
his
face
at
west
lynne
i
ll
set
the
whole
police
of
england
upon
his
track
that
he
may
be
brought
here
as
he
ought
if
he
must
come
when
locksley
told
me
of
it
just
now
i
raised
my
hand
to
knock
him
down
so
infamously
false
did
i
deem
the
report
do
you
know
anything
of
his
having
been
here
continued
the
justice
to
his
wife
in
a
pointed
resolute
tone
how
hare
would
have
extricated
herself
or
what
she
would
have
answered
can
not
even
be
imagined
but
carlyle
interposed
you
are
frightening
hare
sir
don
t
you
see
that
she
knows
nothing
of
it
that
the
very
report
of
such
a
thing
is
alarming
her
into
illness
but
allow
me
to
inquire
what
it
may
be
that
locksley
said
i
met
him
at
the
gate
retorted
justice
hare
turning
his
attention
upon
carlyle
he
was
going
by
as
i
reached
it
oh
justice
i
am
glad
i
met
you
that
s
a
nasty
report
in
the
place
that
richard
has
been
here
i
d
see
what
i
could
do
toward
hushing
it
up
sir
if
i
were
you
for
it
may
only
serve
to
put
the
police
in
mind
of
by
gone
things
which
it
may
be
better
they
should
carlyle
i
went
as
i
tell
you
to
knock
him
down
i
asked
him
how
he
could
have
the
hardihood
to
repeat
such
slander
to
my
face
he
was
on
the
high
horse
directly
said
the
parish
spoke
the
slander
not
he
and
i
got
out
of
him
what
it
was
he
had
and
what
was
it
interrupted
carlyle
more
eagerly
than
he
generally
spoke
why
they
say
the
fellow
showed
himself
here
some
time
ago
a
year
or
so
disguised
as
a
farm
laborer
confounded
fools
not
but
what
he
d
have
been
the
fool
had
he
done
to
be
sure
he
would
repeated
carlyle
and
he
is
not
fool
enough
for
that
sir
let
west
lynne
talk
hare
but
do
not
put
faith
in
a
word
of
its
gossip
i
never
do
poor
richard
wherever
he
may
be
i
won
t
have
him
pitied
in
my
presence
burst
forth
the
justice
poor
richard
indeed
villain
richard
if
you
i
was
about
to
observe
that
wherever
he
may
be
whether
in
the
backwoods
of
america
or
digging
for
gold
in
california
or
wandering
about
the
united
kingdom
there
is
little
fear
that
he
will
quit
his
place
of
safety
to
dare
the
dangerous
ground
of
west
lynne
had
i
been
you
sir
i
should
have
laughed
at
locksley
and
his
why
does
west
lynne
invent
such
lies
ah
there
s
the
rub
i
dare
say
west
lynne
could
not
tell
why
if
it
were
paid
for
doing
it
but
it
seems
to
have
been
a
lame
story
it
had
got
up
this
time
if
they
must
have
concocted
a
report
that
richard
had
been
seen
at
west
lynne
why
put
it
back
to
a
year
ago
why
not
have
fixed
it
for
or
yesterday
if
i
heard
anything
more
i
would
treat
it
with
the
silence
and
contempt
it
deserves
silence
and
contempt
were
not
greatly
in
the
justice
s
line
noise
and
explosion
were
more
so
but
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
judgment
of
carlyle
and
growling
a
sort
of
assent
he
once
more
set
forth
to
pay
his
evening
visit
oh
archibald
uttered
hare
when
her
husband
was
down
the
path
what
a
mercy
that
you
were
here
i
should
inevitably
have
betrayed
barbara
turned
round
from
the
window
but
what
could
have
possessed
locksley
to
say
what
he
did
she
exclaimed
i
have
no
doubt
locksley
spoke
with
a
motive
said
carlyle
he
is
not
unfriendly
to
richard
and
thought
probably
that
by
telling
hare
of
the
report
he
might
get
it
stopped
the
rumor
had
been
mentioned
to
barbara
turned
cold
all
over
how
can
it
have
come
to
light
she
breathed
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
said
carlyle
the
person
to
mention
it
to
me
was
tom
herbert
i
say
said
he
meeting
me
yesterday
what
s
this
row
about
dick
hare
what
now
i
asked
him
why
that
dick
was
at
west
lynne
some
time
back
disguised
as
a
farm
just
the
same
you
see
that
locksley
said
to
hare
i
laughed
at
tom
herbert
continued
carlyle
turned
his
report
into
ridicule
also
before
i
had
done
with
will
it
be
the
means
of
causing
richard
s
detection
murmured
hare
from
between
her
dry
lips
no
no
warmly
responded
carlyle
had
the
report
arisen
immediately
after
he
was
really
here
it
might
not
have
been
so
pleasant
but
nearly
two
years
have
elapsed
since
the
period
be
under
no
uneasiness
dear
hare
for
rely
upon
it
there
is
no
but
how
could
it
have
come
out
archibald
she
urged
and
at
this
distant
period
of
time
i
assure
you
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
imagine
had
anybody
at
west
lynne
seen
and
recognized
richard
they
would
have
spoken
of
it
at
the
time
do
not
let
it
trouble
you
the
rumor
will
die
hare
sighed
deeply
and
left
the
room
to
proceed
to
her
own
chamber
barbara
and
carlyle
were
alone
oh
that
the
real
murderer
could
be
discovered
she
aspirated
clasping
her
hands
to
be
subjected
to
these
shocks
of
fear
is
dreadful
mamma
will
not
be
herself
for
days
to
i
wish
the
right
man
could
be
found
but
it
seems
as
far
off
as
ever
remarked
carlyle
barbara
sat
ruminating
it
seemed
that
she
would
say
something
to
carlyle
but
a
feeling
caused
her
to
hesitate
when
she
did
at
length
speak
it
was
in
a
low
timid
voice
you
remember
the
description
richard
gave
that
last
night
of
the
person
he
had
met
the
true
thorn
did
it
strike
you
then
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
to
think
that
it
accorded
with
some
one
in
what
way
barbara
he
asked
after
a
pause
it
accorded
with
the
description
richard
always
gave
of
the
man
richard
spoke
of
the
peculiar
movement
of
throwing
off
the
hair
from
the
forehead
in
this
way
did
that
strike
you
as
being
familiar
in
connection
with
the
white
hand
and
the
diamond
ring
many
have
a
habit
of
pushing
off
their
hair
i
think
i
do
it
myself
sometimes
barbara
what
do
you
mean
have
you
a
suspicion
of
any
one
have
you
she
returned
answering
the
question
by
asking
another
i
have
not
since
captain
thorn
was
disposed
of
my
suspicions
have
not
pointed
this
sealed
barbara
s
lips
she
had
hers
vague
doubts
bringing
wonder
more
than
anything
else
at
times
she
had
thought
the
same
doubts
might
have
occurred
to
carlyle
she
now
found
that
they
had
not
the
terrible
domestic
calamity
which
had
happened
to
carlyle
the
same
night
that
richard
protested
he
had
seen
thorn
had
prevented
barbara
s
discussing
the
matter
with
him
then
and
she
had
never
done
so
since
richard
had
never
been
further
heard
of
and
the
affair
had
remained
in
abeyance
i
begin
to
despair
of
its
ever
being
discovered
she
observed
what
will
become
of
poor
richard
we
can
but
wait
and
hope
that
time
may
bring
forth
its
own
elucidation
continued
carlyle
ah
sighed
barbara
but
it
is
weary
waiting
weary
how
is
it
you
contrive
to
get
under
the
paternal
displeasure
he
resumed
in
a
gayer
tone
she
blushed
vividly
and
it
was
her
only
answer
the
major
thorn
alluded
to
by
your
papa
is
our
old
friend
i
presume
barbara
inclined
her
head
he
is
a
very
pleasant
man
barbara
many
a
young
lady
in
west
lynne
would
be
proud
to
get
there
was
a
pause
barbara
broke
it
but
she
did
not
look
at
carlyle
as
she
spoke
the
other
rumor
is
it
a
correct
one
what
other
rumor
that
you
are
to
marry
louisa
it
is
not
i
have
no
intention
of
marrying
any
one
nay
i
will
say
it
more
strongly
it
is
my
intention
not
to
marry
any
one
to
remain
as
i
barbara
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
you
look
amused
barbara
have
you
been
lending
your
credence
to
the
gossips
who
have
so
kindly
disposed
of
me
to
louisa
dobede
not
so
but
louisa
dobede
is
a
girl
to
be
coveted
and
as
mamma
says
it
might
be
happier
for
you
if
you
married
again
i
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
do
no
she
who
was
my
wife
what
of
that
uttered
barbara
in
simplicity
he
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
and
when
he
did
it
was
in
a
low
almost
imperceptible
tone
as
he
stood
by
the
table
at
which
barbara
sat
and
looked
down
on
her
whosoever
putteth
away
his
wife
and
marrieth
another
committeth
and
before
barbara
could
answer
if
indeed
she
had
found
any
answer
to
make
or
had
recovered
her
surprise
he
had
taken
his
hat
and
was
gone
to
return
for
a
short
while
to
lady
isabel
as
the
year
advanced
she
grew
stronger
and
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
she
made
preparations
for
quitting
grenoble
where
she
would
fix
her
residence
or
what
she
would
do
she
knew
not
she
was
miserable
and
restless
and
cared
little
what
became
of
her
the
remotest
spot
on
earth
one
unpenetrated
by
the
steps
of
civilized
man
appeared
the
most
desirable
for
her
where
was
she
to
find
this
she
set
out
on
her
search
she
and
the
child
and
its
nurse
not
susanne
susanne
had
a
sweetheart
in
grenoble
and
declined
to
leave
it
so
a
girl
was
engaged
for
the
child
in
her
place
lady
isabel
wound
up
her
housekeeping
had
her
things
packed
and
forwarded
to
paris
there
to
wait
her
orders
and
finally
quitted
grenoble
it
was
a
fine
day
when
she
left
it
all
too
fine
for
the
dark
ending
it
was
to
bring
when
a
railway
accident
does
take
place
in
france
it
is
an
accident
none
of
your
affairs
where
a
few
bruises
and
a
great
fright
are
the
extent
of
the
damages
but
too
often
a
calamity
whose
remembrance
lasts
a
lifetime
lady
isabel
had
travelled
a
considerable
distance
that
first
day
and
at
the
dusk
of
evening
as
they
were
approaching
a
place
cammere
where
she
purposed
to
halt
for
the
night
a
dreadful
accident
occurred
the
details
need
not
be
given
and
will
not
be
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
some
of
the
passengers
were
killed
her
child
and
nurse
being
amongst
them
and
she
herself
was
dangerously
injured
the
injuries
lay
chiefly
in
her
left
leg
and
in
her
face
the
lower
part
of
her
face
the
surgeons
taking
their
cursory
view
of
her
as
they
did
of
the
rest
of
the
sufferers
were
not
sparing
in
their
remarks
for
they
believed
her
to
be
insensible
she
had
gathered
that
the
leg
was
to
be
amputated
and
that
she
would
probably
die
under
the
operation
but
her
turn
to
be
attended
to
was
not
yet
how
she
contrived
to
write
she
never
knew
but
she
got
a
pen
and
ink
brought
to
her
and
did
succeed
in
scrawling
a
letter
to
lord
mount
severn
she
told
him
that
a
sad
accident
had
taken
place
she
could
not
say
how
all
was
confusion
and
that
her
child
and
maid
were
killed
she
herself
was
dangerously
injured
and
was
about
to
undergo
an
operation
which
the
doctors
believed
she
could
not
survive
only
in
case
of
her
death
would
the
letter
be
sent
to
lord
mount
severn
she
could
not
die
she
said
without
a
word
of
thanks
for
all
his
kindness
and
she
begged
him
when
he
saw
carlyle
to
say
that
with
her
last
breath
she
humbly
implored
his
forgiveness
and
his
children
s
whom
she
no
longer
dared
to
call
hers
now
this
letter
by
the
officiousness
of
a
servant
at
the
inn
to
which
the
sufferers
were
carried
was
taken
at
once
to
the
post
and
after
all
things
turned
out
not
quite
so
bad
as
anticipated
for
when
the
doctors
came
to
examine
the
state
of
lady
isabel
not
cursorily
they
found
there
would
be
no
absolute
necessity
for
the
operation
contemplated
fond
as
the
french
surgeons
are
of
the
knife
to
resort
to
it
in
this
instance
would
have
been
cruel
and
they
proceeded
to
other
means
of
cure
the
letter
was
duly
delivered
at
the
town
house
of
lord
mount
severn
where
it
was
addressed
the
countess
was
sojourning
there
for
a
few
days
she
had
quitted
it
after
the
season
but
some
business
or
pleasure
had
called
her
again
to
town
lord
vane
was
with
her
but
the
earl
was
in
scotland
they
were
at
breakfast
she
and
her
son
when
the
letter
was
brought
in
eighteen
pence
to
pay
its
scrawled
address
its
foreign
aspect
its
appearance
altogether
excited
her
curiosity
in
her
own
mind
she
believed
she
had
dropped
upon
a
nice
little
conjugal
mare
s
nest
i
shall
open
this
cried
she
why
it
is
addressed
to
papa
exclaimed
lord
vane
who
possessed
all
his
father
s
notions
of
honor
but
such
an
odd
letter
it
may
require
an
immediate
answer
or
is
some
begging
petition
perhaps
get
on
with
your
lady
mount
severn
opened
the
letter
and
with
some
difficulty
spelt
through
its
contents
they
shocked
even
her
how
dreadful
she
uttered
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
what
is
dreadful
asked
lord
vane
looking
up
from
his
breakfast
lady
isabel
isabel
vane
you
have
not
forgotten
her
forgotten
her
he
echoed
why
mamma
i
must
possess
a
funny
memory
to
have
forgotten
her
she
is
dead
she
has
been
killed
in
a
railway
accident
in
his
large
blue
eyes
honest
and
true
as
they
had
been
in
childhood
filled
and
his
face
flushed
he
said
nothing
for
emotion
was
strong
within
him
but
shocking
as
it
is
it
is
better
for
her
went
on
the
countess
for
poor
creature
what
could
her
future
life
had
been
oh
don
t
say
it
impetuously
broke
out
the
young
viscount
killed
in
a
railway
accident
and
for
you
to
say
that
it
is
better
for
her
so
it
is
better
said
the
countess
don
t
go
into
heroics
william
you
are
quite
old
enough
to
know
that
she
had
brought
misery
upon
herself
and
disgrace
upon
all
connected
with
her
no
one
could
ever
have
taken
notice
of
her
i
would
said
the
boy
stoutly
lady
mount
severn
smiled
derisively
i
would
i
never
liked
anybody
in
the
world
half
so
much
as
i
liked
that
s
past
and
gone
you
would
not
have
continued
to
like
her
after
the
disgrace
she
somebody
else
wrought
more
of
the
disgrace
than
she
did
and
had
i
been
a
man
i
would
have
shot
him
dead
flashed
the
viscount
you
don
t
know
anything
about
don
t
i
returned
he
not
over
dutifully
but
lady
mount
severn
had
not
brought
him
up
to
be
dutiful
may
i
read
the
letter
mamma
he
demanded
after
a
pause
if
you
can
read
it
she
replied
tossing
it
to
him
it
is
written
in
the
strangest
style
syllables
divided
and
the
words
running
one
into
the
other
she
wrote
it
herself
when
she
was
lord
vane
took
the
letter
to
a
window
and
stayed
looking
over
it
for
some
time
the
countess
ate
an
egg
and
a
plate
of
ham
meanwhile
presently
he
came
back
with
it
folded
and
laid
in
on
the
table
you
will
forward
it
to
papa
he
observed
i
shall
forward
it
to
him
but
there
s
no
hurry
and
i
don
t
exactly
know
where
your
papa
may
be
i
shall
send
the
notice
of
her
death
to
the
papers
and
i
am
glad
to
do
it
it
is
a
blight
removed
from
the
mamma
i
do
think
you
are
the
unkindest
woman
that
ever
breathed
i
ll
give
you
something
to
call
me
unkind
for
if
you
don
t
mind
retorted
the
countess
her
color
rising
dock
you
of
your
holiday
and
pack
you
back
to
school
a
few
mornings
after
this
carlyle
left
east
lynne
and
proceeded
to
his
office
as
usual
scarcely
was
he
seated
when
dill
entered
and
carlyle
looked
at
him
inquiringly
for
it
was
not
carlyle
s
custom
to
be
intruded
upon
by
any
person
until
he
had
opened
his
letters
then
he
would
ring
for
dill
the
letters
and
the
times
newspaper
lay
on
the
table
before
him
the
old
gentleman
came
up
in
a
covert
timid
sort
of
way
which
made
carlyle
look
all
the
more
i
beg
pardon
sir
will
you
let
me
ask
if
you
have
heard
any
particular
news
yes
i
have
heard
it
replied
carlyle
then
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
over
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
probably
had
not
archibald
and
i
thought
i
would
have
said
a
word
to
prepare
you
before
you
came
upon
it
suddenly
in
the
to
prepare
me
echoed
carlyle
as
old
dill
was
turning
away
why
what
has
come
to
you
dill
are
you
afraid
my
nerves
are
growing
delicate
or
that
i
shall
faint
over
the
loss
of
a
hundred
pounds
at
the
very
most
we
shall
not
suffer
above
that
old
dill
turned
back
again
if
i
don
t
believe
you
are
speaking
of
the
failure
of
kent
green
it
s
not
that
archibald
they
won
t
affect
us
much
and
there
ll
be
a
dividend
report
what
is
it
then
then
you
have
not
heard
it
sir
i
am
glad
that
i
m
in
time
it
might
not
be
well
for
you
to
have
seen
it
without
a
word
of
preparation
if
you
have
not
gone
demented
you
will
tell
me
what
you
mean
dill
and
leave
me
to
my
letters
cried
carlyle
wondering
excessively
at
his
sober
clerk
s
words
and
manner
old
dill
put
his
hands
upon
the
times
newspaper
it
s
here
archibald
in
the
column
of
deaths
the
first
on
the
list
please
prepare
yourself
a
little
before
you
look
at
he
shuffled
out
quickly
and
carlyle
as
quickly
unfolded
the
paper
it
was
as
old
dill
said
the
first
on
the
list
of
deaths
at
cammere
in
france
on
the
isabel
mary
only
child
of
william
late
earl
of
mount
clients
called
carlyle
s
bell
did
not
ring
an
hour
or
two
passed
and
old
dill
protested
that
carlyle
was
engaged
until
he
could
protest
no
longer
he
went
in
deprecatingly
carlyle
sat
yet
with
the
newspaper
before
him
and
the
letters
unopened
at
his
elbow
there
are
one
or
two
who
will
come
in
archibald
who
will
see
you
what
am
i
to
say
carlyle
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
his
wits
had
been
in
the
next
world
then
he
swept
the
newspaper
from
before
him
and
was
the
calm
collected
man
of
business
again
as
the
news
of
lady
isabel
s
marriage
had
first
come
in
the
knowledge
of
lord
mount
severn
through
the
newspapers
so
singular
to
say
did
the
tidings
of
her
death
the
next
post
brought
him
the
letter
which
his
wife
had
tardily
forwarded
but
unlike
lady
mount
severn
he
did
not
take
her
death
as
entirely
upon
trust
he
thought
it
possible
the
letter
might
have
been
dispatched
without
its
having
taken
place
and
he
deemed
it
incumbent
on
him
to
make
inquiries
he
wrote
immediately
to
the
authorities
of
the
town
in
the
best
french
he
could
muster
asking
for
particulars
and
whether
she
was
really
dead
he
received
in
due
course
a
satisfactory
answer
satisfactory
in
so
far
as
that
it
set
his
doubts
at
rest
he
had
inquired
after
her
by
her
proper
name
and
title
la
dame
isabelle
vane
and
as
the
authorities
could
find
none
of
the
survivors
owning
that
name
they
took
it
for
granted
she
was
dead
they
wrote
him
word
that
the
child
and
nurse
were
killed
on
the
spot
two
ladies
occupying
the
same
compartment
of
the
carriage
had
since
died
one
of
whom
was
no
doubt
the
mother
and
lady
he
inquired
for
she
was
dead
and
buried
sufficient
money
having
been
found
upon
her
person
to
defray
the
few
necessary
expenses
thus
through
no
premeditated
intention
of
lady
isabel
news
of
her
death
went
forth
to
lord
mount
severn
and
to
the
world
her
first
intimation
that
she
was
regarded
as
dead
was
through
a
copy
of
that
very
day
s
times
seen
by
carlyle
seen
by
lord
mount
severn
an
english
traveller
who
had
been
amongst
the
sufferers
and
who
received
the
english
newspaper
daily
sometimes
lent
them
to
her
to
read
she
was
not
travelling
under
her
own
name
she
left
that
behind
her
when
she
left
grenoble
she
had
rendered
her
own
too
notorious
to
risk
the
chance
recognition
of
travellers
and
the
authorities
little
thought
that
the
quiet
unobtrusive
madame
vine
slowly
recovering
at
the
inn
was
the
dame
isabella
vane
respecting
whom
the
grand
english
comte
wrote
lady
isabel
understood
it
at
once
that
the
dispatching
of
her
letter
had
been
the
foundation
of
the
misapprehension
and
she
began
to
ask
herself
now
why
she
should
undeceive
lord
mount
severn
and
the
world
she
longed
none
knew
with
what
intense
longings
to
be
unknown
obscure
totally
unrecognized
by
all
none
can
know
it
till
they
have
put
a
barrier
between
themselves
and
the
world
as
she
had
done
the
child
was
gone
happy
being
she
thought
she
could
never
be
sufficiently
thankful
that
it
was
released
from
the
uncertain
future
therefore
she
had
not
his
support
to
think
of
she
had
only
herself
and
surely
she
could
with
ease
earn
enough
for
that
or
she
could
starve
it
mattered
little
which
no
there
was
no
necessity
for
her
continuing
to
accept
the
bounty
of
lord
mount
severn
and
she
would
let
him
and
everybody
else
continue
to
believe
that
she
was
dead
and
be
henceforth
only
madame
vine
a
resolution
she
adhered
to
thus
the
unhappy
isabel
s
career
was
looked
upon
as
run
lord
mount
severn
forwarded
her
letter
to
carlyle
with
the
confirmation
of
her
death
which
he
had
obtained
from
the
french
authorities
it
was
a
nine
day
s
wonder
that
poor
erring
lady
isabel
was
dead
people
did
not
call
her
names
in
the
very
teeth
of
her
fate
and
then
it
was
over
it
was
over
lady
isabel
was
as
one
forgotten
chapter
xxviii
an
unexpected
visitor
at
east
lynne
there
went
sailing
up
the
avenue
to
east
lynne
a
lady
one
windy
afternoon
if
not
a
lady
she
was
attired
as
one
a
flounced
dress
and
a
stylish
looking
shawl
and
a
white
veil
a
very
pretty
woman
tall
and
slender
was
she
and
she
minced
as
she
walked
and
coquetted
with
her
head
and
altogether
contrived
to
show
that
she
had
quite
as
much
vanity
as
brains
she
went
boldly
up
to
the
broad
entrance
of
the
house
and
boldly
rang
at
it
drawing
her
white
veil
over
her
face
as
she
did
so
one
of
the
answered
it
not

and
seeing
somebody
very
smart
before
him
bowed
deferentially

somewhat
sharply
repeated
the
lady
as
if
impatient
of
any
delay
i
wish
to
see
the
man
was
rather
taken
aback
he
had
deemed
it
a
visitor
to
the
house
and
was
prepared
to
usher
her
to
the
at
least
but
it
seemed
it
was
only
a
visitor
to
joyce
he
showed
her
into
a
small
parlor
and
went
upstairs
to
the
nursery
where
joyce
was
sitting
with
wilson
for
there
had
been
no
change
in
the
domestic
department
of
east
lynne
joyce
remained
as
upper
maid
partially
superintending
the
servants
attending
upon

and
making

dresses
as
usual
wilson
was

joyce

some
one
to

the
children

for
yourself
i
think
she
asked
for
miss
joyce
looked
at
the
man
but
she
put
down
her
work
and
proceeded
to
the
gray
parlor
a
pretty
woman
vain
and
dashing
threw
up
her
white
veil
at
her
entrance
well
joyce
how
are
you
joyce
always
pale
turned
paler
still
as
she
gazed
in
blank
consternation
was
it
really
afy
who
stood
before
her
afy
the
erring
afy
it
was
and
she
stood
there
holding
out
her
hand
to
joyce
with
what
wilson
would
have
called
all
the
brass
in
the
world
joyce
could
not
reconcile
her
mind
to
link
her
own
with
it
excuse
me
afy
but
i
can
not
take
your
hand
i
can
not
welcome
you
here
what

induced

to
come
if
you
are
going
to
be
upon
the
high
ropes
it
seems
i
might
as
well

stayed

reply
given
in

pert
but
manner

ever
used

damage
yours

are
looked
upon
in
the
neighborhood
as
worse
than
poison
afy
returned
joyce
in
a
tone
not
of
anger
but
of
sorrow
where
s
richard
hare
afy
tossed
her
head
where
s
who
asked
she
richard
hare
my
question
was
plain
how

know
where
he
is
it

like
your
impudence

mention
him
to
me
why
don
t
you
ask
me
where
old
nick
is
and
how
he
does
i

face
indignant
and
her
voice
passionate
i
have
put
up
with
some
things
from
you
in
my
time
but
human
nature
has
its
limits
of
endurance
and
i
won
t
bear
that
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
richard
hare
since
that
night
of
horror
i
wish
i
could
i
d
help
to
hang
joyce
paused
the
belief
that
afy
was
with
him
had
been
long
and
deeply
imbued
within
her
it
was
the
and
firm
conviction
of
all
west
lynne
and
a
settled
belief
such
as
that
is
not
easily
shaken
was
afy
telling
the
truth
she
knew
her
propensity
for
making
false
assertions
when
they
served
to
excuse
herself
afy
she
said
at
length
let
me
understand
you
when
you
left
this
place
was
it
not
to
share
richard
hare
s
flight
have
you
not
been
living
with
him
no
burst
forth
afy
with
kindling
eyes
living
with
him
with
our
father
s
murderer
shame
upon
you
joyce
hallijohn
you
must
be
precious
wicked
yourself
to
suppose
if
i
have
judged
you
wrongly
afy
i
sincerely
beg
your
pardon
not
only
myself
but
the
whole
of
west
lynne
believed
you
were
with
him
and
the
thought
has
caused
me
pain
night
and
what
a
cannibal
minded
set
you
all
must
be
then
was
afy
s
indignant
rejoinder
what
have
you
been
doing
ever
since
then
where
have
you
been
never
mind
i
say
repeated
afy
west
lynne
has
not
been
so
complimentary
to
me
it
appears
that
i
need
put
myself
out
of
my
way
to
satisfy
its
curiosity
i
was
knocking
about
a
bit
at
first
but
i
soon
settled
down
as
steady
as
old
time
as
steady
as
are
you
married
inquired
joyce
noting
the
word
catch
me
marrying
retorted
afy
i
like
my
liberty
too
well
not
but
what
i
might
be
induced
to
change
my
condition
if
anything
out
of
the
way
eligible
occurred
it
must
be
very
eligible
though
to
tempt
me
i
am
what
i
suppose
you
call
yourself
a
lady
s
indeed
said
joyce
much
relieved
and
are
you
comfortable
afy
are
you
in
good
service
middling
for
that
the
pay
s
not
amiss
but
there
s
a
great
deal
to
do
and
lady
mount
severn
s
too
much
of
a
tartar
for
joyce
looked
at
her
in
surprise
what
have
you
to
do
with
lady
mount
severn
well
that
s
good
it
s
where
i
am
at
at
lady
mount
severn
s
why
not
i
have
been
there
two
years
it
is
not
a
great
deal
longer
i
shall
stop
though
she
had
too
much
vinegar
in
her
for
me
but
it
poses
me
to
imagine
what
on
earth
could
have
induced
you
to
fancy
i
should
go
off
with
that
dick
hare
she
added
for
she
could
not
forget
the
grievance
look
at
the
circumstances
argued
joyce
you
both
but
not
nearly
together
there
were
only
a
few
days
intervening
and
you
had
neither
money
nor
you
don
t
know
what
i
had
but
i
would
rather
have
died
of
want
on
father
s
grave
than
have
shared
his
means
continued
afy
growing
passionate
again
where
is
he
not
hung
or
i
should
have
heard
of
he
has
never
been
seen
since
that
night
nor
heard
of
nor
heard
of
most
people
think
he
is
in
australia
or
some
other
foreign
the
best
place
for
him
the
more
distance
he
puts
between
him
and
home
the
better
if
he
does
come
back
i
hope
he
ll
get
his
desserts
which
is
a
rope
s
end
i
d
go
to
his
you
are
as
bitter
against
him
as
justice
hare
he
would
bring
his
son
back
to
suffer
if
he
a
old
camel
remarked
afy
in
allusion
to
the
qualities
social
and
amiable
of
the
revered
justice
i
don
t
defend
dick
hare
i
hate
him
too
much
for
that
but
if
his
father
had
treated
him
differently
dick
might
have
been
different
well
let
s
talk
of
something
else
the
subject
invariably
gives
me
the
shivers
who
is
mistress
here
miss
oh
i
might
have
guessed
that
is
she
as
fierce
as
ever
there
is
little
alteration
in
and
there
won
t
be
on
this
side
the
grave
i
say
joyce
i
don
t
want
to
encounter
her
she
might
set
on
at
me
like
she
has
done
many
a
time
in
the
old
days
little
love
was
there
lost
between
me
and
corny
carlyle
is
carlyle
at
home
he
will
be
home
to
dinner
i
dare
say
you
would
like
some
tea
you
shall
come
and
take
it
with
me
and
wilson
in
the
i
was
thinking
you
might
have
the
grace
to
offer
me
something
cried
afy
i
intend
to
stop
till
in
the
neighborhood
my
lady
gave
me
two
days
holiday
for
she
was
going
to
see
her
dreadful
old
grandmother
where
she
can
t
take
a
maid
and
i
thought
i
d
use
it
in
coming
to
have
a
look
at
the
old
place
again
don
t
stare
at
me
in
that
blank
way
as
if
you
feared
i
should
ask
the
grand
loan
of
sleeping
here
i
shall
sleep
at
the
mount
severn
i
was
not
glancing
at
such
a
thought
afy
come
and
take
your
bonnet
is
the
nursery
full
of
children
there
is
only
one
child
in
it
miss
lucy
and
master
william
are
with
the
wilson
received
afy
with
lofty
condescension
having
richard
hare
in
her
thoughts
but
joyce
explained
that
it
was
all
a
misapprehension
that
her
sister
had
never
been
near
richard
hare
but
was
as
indignant
against
him
as
they
were
upon
which
wilson
grew
cordial
and
chatty
rejoicing
in
the
delightful
recreation
her
tongue
would
enjoy
that
evening
afy
s
account
of
herself
as
to
past
proceedings
was
certainly
not
the
most
satisfactory
in
the
world
but
altogether
taken
in
the
present
it
was
so
vast
an
improvement
upon
joyce
s
conclusions
that
she
had
not
felt
so
elated
for
many
a
day
when
carlyle
returned
home
joyce
sought
him
and
acquainted
him
with
what
had
happened
that
afy
was
come
was
maid
to
lady
mount
severn
and
above
all
that
she
had
never
been
with
richard
hare
ah
you
remember
what
i
said
joyce
he
remarked
that
i
did
not
believe
afy
was
with
richard
i
have
been
telling
her
so
sir
to
be
sure
when
i
informed
her
what
people
had
believed
continued
joyce
she
nearly
went
into
one
of
her
old
does
she
seem
steady
joyce
i
think
so
sir
steady
for
her
i
was
thinking
sir
that
as
she
appears
to
have
turned
out
so
respectable
and
is
with
lady
mount
severn
you
perhaps
might
see
no
objection
to
her
sleeping
here
for
it
would
be
better
than
for
her
to
go
to
the
inn
as
she
talks
of
none
at
all
replied
carlyle
let
her
later
in
the
evening
after
carlyle
s
dinner
a
message
came
that
afy
was
to
go
to
him
accordingly
she
proceeded
to
his
presence
so
afy
you
have
returned
to
let
west
lynne
know
that
you
are
alive
sit
west
lynne
may
go
for
me
in
future
sir
for
all
the
heed
i
shall
take
of
it
retorted
afy
a
set
of
mongers
to
take
and
say
i
had
gone
after
richard
hare
you
should
not
have
gone
off
at
all
well
sir
that
was
my
business
and
i
chose
to
go
i
could
not
stop
in
the
cottage
after
that
night
s
there
is
a
mystery
attached
to
that
night
s
work
afy
observed
carlyle
a
mystery
that
i
can
not
fathom
perhaps
you
can
help
me
what
mystery
sir
returned
afy
carlyle
leaned
forward
his
arms
on
the
table
afy
had
taken
a
chair
at
the
other
end
of
it
who
was
it
that
committed
the
murder
he
demanded
in
a
grave
and
somewhat
imperative
tone
afy
stared
some
moments
before
she
replied
astonished
at
the
question
who
committed
the
murder
sir
she
uttered
at
length
richard
hare
committed
it
everybody
knows
did
you
see
it
done
no
replied
afy
if
i
had
seen
it
the
fright
and
horror
would
have
killed
me
richard
hare
quarreled
with
my
father
and
drew
the
gun
upon
him
in
you
assume
this
to
have
been
the
case
afy
as
others
have
assumed
it
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
richard
hare
who
killed
your
not
richard
hare
exclaimed
afy
after
a
pause
then
who
do
you
think
did
it
sir
i
nonsense
i
know
he
did
it
proceeded
afy
it
is
true
that
i
did
not
see
it
done
but
i
know
it
for
all
that
i
know
it
you
can
not
know
it
i
do
know
it
sir
i
would
not
assert
it
to
you
if
i
did
not
if
richard
hare
was
here
present
before
us
and
swore
until
he
was
black
in
the
face
that
it
was
not
him
i
could
convict
by
what
means
i
had
rather
not
say
sir
but
you
may
believe
me
for
i
am
speaking
there
was
another
friend
of
yours
present
that
evening
afy
lieutenant
afy
s
face
turned
crimson
she
was
evidently
surprised
but
carlyle
s
speech
and
manner
were
authoritative
and
she
saw
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
trifle
with
him
i
know
he
was
sir
a
young
chap
who
used
to
ride
over
some
evenings
to
see
me
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
where
did
he
ride
from
he
was
stopping
with
some
friends
at
swainson
he
was
nobody
what
was
his
name
questioned
carlyle
thorn
said
afy
i
mean
his
real
name
thorn
was
an
assumed
oh
dear
no
returned
afy
thorn
was
his
carlyle
paused
and
looked
at
her
afy
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
thorn
was
only
an
assumed
name
now
i
have
a
motive
for
wishing
to
know
his
real
one
and
you
would
very
much
oblige
me
by
confiding
it
to
me
what
was
it
i
don
t
know
that
he
had
any
other
name
sir
i
am
sure
he
had
no
other
persisted
afy
he
was
lieutenant
thorn
then
and
he
was
captain
thorn
you
have
seen
him
since
once
in
a
way
we
have
where
is
he
now
now
oh
my
goodness
i
don
t
know
anything
about
him
now
muttered
afy
i
have
not
heard
of
him
or
seen
him
for
a
long
while
i
think
i
heard
something
about
his
going
to
india
with
his
what
regiment
is
he
in
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
about
that
said
afy
is
not
one
regiment
the
same
as
another
they
are
all
in
the
army
aren
t
they
sir
afy
i
must
find
this
captain
thorn
do
you
know
anything
of
his
family
afy
shook
her
head
i
don
t
think
he
had
any
i
never
heard
him
mention
as
much
as
a
brother
or
a
and
you
persist
in
saying
his
name
was
thorn
i
persist
in
saying
it
because
it
was
his
name
i
am
positive
it
was
his
afy
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
want
to
find
him
i
believe
it
was
he
who
murdered
your
father
not
richard
afy
s
mouth
and
eyes
gradually
opened
and
her
face
turned
hot
and
cold
alternately
then
passion
mastered
her
and
she
burst
forth
it
s
a
lie
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
whoever
told
you
that
told
you
a
lie
thorn
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
i
had
i
ll
swear
i
tell
you
afy
i
believe
thorn
to
have
been
the
man
you
were
not
present
you
can
not
know
who
actually
did
yes
i
can
and
do
know
said
afy
bursting
into
sobs
of
hysterical
passion
thorn
was
with
me
when
it
happened
so
it
could
not
have
been
thorn
it
was
that
wicked
richard
hare
sir
have
i
not
said
that
i
ll
swear
it
thorn
was
with
you
at
the
moment
of
the
murder
repeated
carlyle
yes
he
was
shrieked
afy
nearly
beside
herself
with
emotion
whoever
has
been
trying
to
put
it
off
richard
hare
and
on
to
him
is
a
wicked
wretch
it
was
richard
hare
and
nobody
else
and
i
hope
he
ll
be
hung
for
it
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
afy
gravely
spoke
carlyle
truth
echoed
afy
flinging
up
her
hands
would
i
tell
a
lie
over
my
father
s
death
if
thorn
had
done
it
would
i
screen
him
or
shuffle
it
off
to
richard
hare
not
carlyle
felt
uncertain
and
bewildered
that
afy
was
sincere
in
what
she
said
was
but
too
apparent
he
spoke
again
but
afy
had
risen
from
her
chair
to
leave
locksley
was
in
the
wood
that
evening
otway
bethel
was
in
it
could
either
of
them
have
been
the
culprit
no
sir
firmly
retorted
afy
the
culprit
was
richard
hare
and
i
d
say
it
with
my
latest
breath
i
d
say
it
because
i
know
it
though
i
don
t
choose
to
say
how
i
know
it
time
enough
when
he
gets
she
quitted
the
room
leaving
carlyle
in
a
state
of
puzzled
bewilderment
was
he
to
believe
afy
or
was
he
to
believe
the
bygone
assertion
of
richard
hare
chapter
xxix
a
night
invasion
of
east
lynne
in
one
of
the
comfortable
of
east
lynne
sat
carlyle
and
his
sister
one
inclement
january
night
the
contrast
within
and
without
was
great
the
warm
blazing
fire
the
handsome
carpet
on
which
it
flickered
the
exceedingly
comfortable
arrangement
of
the
furniture
of
the
room
altogether
and
the
light
of
the
chandelier
which
fell
on
all
presented
a
picture
of
home
peace
though
it
may
not
have
deserved
the
name
of
luxury
without
heavy
flakes
of
snow
were
falling
thickly
flakes
as
large
and
nearly
as
heavy
as
a
crown
piece
rendering
the
atmosphere
so
dense
and
obscure
that
a
man
could
not
see
a
yard
before
him
carlyle
had
driven
home
in
the
pony
carriage
and
the
snow
had
so
settled
upon
him
that
lucy
who
happened
to
see
him
as
he
entered
the
hall
screamed
out
laughingly
that
her
papa
had
turned
into
a
white
man
it
was
now
later
in
the
evening
the
children
were
in
bed
the
governess
was
in
her
own
sitting
room
it
was
not
often
that
miss
carlyle
invited
her
to
theirs
of
an
evening
and
the
house
was
quite
carlyle
was
deep
in
the
pages
of
one
of
the
monthly
periodicals
and
miss
carlyle
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
grumbling
and
grunting
and
sniffling
and
choking
miss
carlyle
was
one
of
your
ladies
who
never
condescended
to
be
of
course
had
she
been
attacked
with
scarlet
fever
or
paralysis
or
vitus
dance
she
must
have
given
in
to
the
enemy
but
trifling
ailments
such
as
headache
influenza
sore
throat
which
other
people
get
passed
her
by
imagine
therefore
her
exasperation
at
finding
her
head
stuffed
up
her
chest
sore
and
her
voice
going
in
short
at
having
for
once
in
her
life
caught
a
cold
like
ordinary
mortals
what
s
the
time
i
wonder
she
exclaimed
carlyle
looked
at
his
watch
it
is
just
nine
then
i
think
i
shall
go
to
bed
i
ll
have
a
basin
of
arrowroot
or
gruel
or
some
slop
of
that
sort
after
i
m
in
it
i
m
sure
i
have
been
free
enough
all
my
life
from
requiring
such
sick
do
so
said
carlyle
it
may
do
you
there
s
one
thing
excellent
for
a
cold
in
the
head
i
know
it
s
to
double
your
flannel
petticoat
crossways
or
any
other
large
piece
of
flannel
you
may
conveniently
have
at
hand
and
put
it
on
over
your
i
ll
try
i
would
said
carlyle
smothering
an
irreverent
laugh
she
sat
on
five
minutes
longer
and
then
left
wishing
carlyle
night
he
resumed
his
reading
but
another
page
or
two
concluded
the
article
upon
which
carlyle
threw
the
book
on
the
table
rose
and
stretched
himself
as
if
tired
of
sitting
he
stirred
the
fire
into
a
brighter
blaze
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
i
wonder
if
it
snows
still
he
exclaimed
to
himself
proceeding
to
the
window
one
of
those
opening
to
the
ground
he
threw
aside
the
half
of
the
warm
crimson
curtain
it
all
looked
dull
and
dark
outside
carlyle
could
see
little
what
the
weather
was
and
he
opened
the
window
and
stepped
half
out
the
snow
was
falling
faster
and
thicker
than
ever
not
at
that
did
carlyle
start
with
surprise
if
not
with
a
more
unpleasant
sensation
but
a
feeling
a
man
s
hand
touch
his
and
at
finding
a
man
s
face
nearly
in
contact
with
his
own
let
me
come
in
carlyle
for
the
love
of
life
i
see
you
are
alone
i
m
dead
beat
and
i
don
t
know
but
i
m
dodged
the
tones
struck
familiarly
on
carlyle
s
ear
he
drew
back
mechanically
a
thousand
perplexing
sensations
overwhelming
him
and
the
man
followed
him
into
the
room
a
white
man
as
lucy
called
her
father
aye
for
he
had
been
hours
and
hours
on
foot
in
the
snow
his
hat
his
clothes
his
eyebrows
his
large
whiskers
all
were
white
lock
the
door
sir
were
his
first
words
need
you
be
told
that
it
was
richard
hare
carlyle
fastened
the
window
drew
the
heavy
curtains
across
and
turned
rapidly
to
lock
the
two
doors
for
there
were
two
to
the
room
one
of
them
leading
into
the
adjoining
one
richard
meanwhile
took
off
his
wet
of
former
memory
his
hat
and
his
false
black
whiskers
wiping
the
snow
from
the
latter
with
his
hand
richard
uttered
carlyle
i
am
thunderstruck
i
fear
you
have
done
wrong
to
come
i
cut
off
from
london
at
a
moment
s
notice
replied
richard
who
was
literally
shivering
with
the
cold
i
m
dodged
carlyle
i
am
indeed
the
police
are
after
me
set
on
by
that
wretch
carlyle
turned
to
the
sideboard
and
poured
out
a
wineglass
of
brandy
drink
it
richard
it
will
warm
i
d
rather
have
it
in
some
hot
water
but
how
am
i
to
get
the
hot
water
brought
in
drink
this
for
now
why
how
you
ah
a
few
hours
outside
in
the
cold
snow
is
enough
to
make
the
strongest
man
tremble
sir
and
it
lies
so
deep
in
places
that
you
have
to
come
along
at
a
snail
s
pace
but
i
ll
tell
you
about
this
business
a
fortnight
ago
i
was
at
a
cabstand
at
the
west
end
talking
to
a
driver
when
some
drops
of
rain
came
down
a
gentleman
and
lady
were
passing
at
the
time
but
i
had
not
paid
any
attention
to
them
by
jove
i
heard
him
exclaim
to
her
i
think
we
re
going
to
have
pepper
we
had
better
take
a
cab
my
with
that
the
man
i
was
talking
to
swung
open
the
door
of
his
cab
and
she
got
in
such
a
fair
young
lady
she
was
i
turned
to
look
at
him
and
you
might
just
have
knocked
me
down
with
astonishment
carlyle
it
was
the
man
indeed
you
thought
i
might
be
mistaken
in
him
that
moonlight
night
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
in
broad
daylight
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
he
looked
at
me
he
turned
as
white
as
cloth
perhaps
i
did
i
don
t
was
he
well
dressed
very
oh
there
s
no
mistaking
his
position
that
he
moves
in
the
higher
classes
there
s
no
doubt
the
cab
drove
away
and
i
got
up
behind
it
the
driver
thought
boys
were
there
and
turned
his
head
and
his
whip
but
i
made
him
a
sign
we
didn
t
go
much
more
than
the
length
of
a
street
i
was
on
the
pavement
before
thorn
was
and
looked
at
him
again
and
again
he
went
white
i
marked
the
house
thinking
it
was
where
he
lived
and
why
did
you
not
give
him
into
custody
richard
richard
hare
shook
his
head
and
my
proofs
of
his
guilt
carlyle
i
could
bring
none
against
him
no
positive
ones
no
i
must
wait
till
i
can
get
proofs
to
do
that
he
would
turn
round
upon
me
now
and
swear
my
life
away
to
murder
well
i
thought
i
d
ascertain
for
certain
what
his
name
was
and
that
night
i
went
to
the
house
and
got
into
conversation
with
one
of
the
servants
who
was
standing
at
the
door
does
captain
thorn
live
here
i
asked
him
mr
westleby
lives
here
said
he
i
don
t
know
any
captain
then
that
s
his
name
thought
i
to
myself
a
youngish
man
isn
t
he
said
i
very
smart
with
a
pretty
wife
i
don
t
know
what
you
call
youngish
he
laughed
my
master
s
turned
sixty
and
his
wife
s
as
that
checked
me
perhaps
he
has
sons
i
asked
not
any
the
man
answered
there
s
nobody
but
their
two
so
with
that
i
told
him
what
i
wanted
that
a
lady
and
gentleman
had
alighted
there
in
a
cab
that
day
and
i
wished
to
know
his
name
well
carlyle
i
could
get
at
nothing
satisfactory
the
fellow
said
that
a
great
many
had
called
there
that
day
for
his
master
was
just
up
from
a
long
illness
and
people
came
to
see
is
that
all
richard
all
i
wish
it
had
been
all
i
kept
looking
about
for
him
in
all
the
best
streets
i
was
half
mad
do
you
not
wonder
if
he
is
in
this
position
of
life
and
resides
in
london
that
you
have
never
dropped
upon
him
previously
interrupted
carlyle
no
sir
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
have
been
afraid
to
show
myself
in
those
latter
parts
of
the
town
fearing
i
might
meet
with
some
one
i
used
to
know
at
home
who
would
recognize
me
so
i
have
kept
mostly
in
obscure
places
stables
and
such
like
i
had
gone
up
to
the
west
end
this
day
on
a
matter
of
well
go
on
with
your
in
a
week
s
time
i
came
upon
him
again
it
was
at
night
he
was
coming
out
of
one
of
the
theatres
and
i
went
up
and
stood
before
what
do
you
want
fellow
he
asked
i
have
seen
you
watching
me
before
i
want
to
know
your
name
i
said
that
s
enough
for
me
at
he
flew
into
a
passion
and
swore
that
if
ever
he
caught
sight
of
me
near
him
again
he
would
hand
me
over
into
custody
and
remember
men
are
not
given
into
custody
for
watching
others
he
significantly
added
i
know
you
and
if
you
have
any
regard
for
yourself
you
ll
keep
out
of
my
he
had
got
into
a
private
carriage
as
he
spoke
and
it
drove
away
i
could
see
that
it
had
a
great
upon
when
do
you
say
this
was
a
week
ago
well
i
could
not
rest
i
was
half
mad
i
say
and
went
about
still
trying
if
i
could
not
discover
his
name
and
who
he
was
i
did
come
upon
him
but
he
was
walking
quickly
with
with
another
gentleman
again
i
saw
him
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
betting
rooms
talking
to
the
same
gentleman
and
his
face
turned
savage
i
believe
with
fear
as
much
as
anger
when
he
discerned
me
he
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
as
if
he
acted
in
a
passion
suddenly
beckoned
to
a
policeman
pointed
me
out
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
fast
tone
that
frightened
me
and
i
slipped
away
two
hours
after
when
i
was
in
quite
a
different
part
of
the
town
in
turning
my
head
i
saw
the
same
policeman
following
me
i
bolted
under
the
horses
of
a
passing
vehicle
down
some
turnings
and
passages
out
into
another
street
and
up
beside
a
cabman
who
was
on
his
box
driving
a
fare
past
i
reached
my
lodgings
in
safety
as
i
thought
but
happening
to
glance
into
the
street
there
i
saw
the
man
again
standing
opposite
and
reconnoitering
the
house
i
had
gone
home
hungry
but
this
took
all
my
hunger
away
from
me
i
opened
the
box
where
i
kept
my
disguise
put
it
on
and
got
out
by
a
back
way
i
have
been
pretty
nearly
ever
since
on
my
feet
reaching
here
i
only
got
a
lift
now
and
but
richard
do
you
know
that
west
lynne
is
the
very
worst
place
you
could
have
flown
to
it
has
come
to
light
that
you
were
here
before
disguised
as
a
farm
who
the
deuce
betrayed
that
interrupted
richard
i
am
unable
to
tell
i
can
not
even
imagine
the
rumor
was
rife
in
the
place
and
it
reached
your
father
s
ear
the
rumor
may
make
people
s
wits
sharper
to
know
you
in
your
disguise
than
they
otherwise
might
have
but
what
was
i
to
do
i
was
forced
to
come
here
first
and
get
a
little
money
i
shall
fix
myself
in
some
other
big
town
far
away
from
london
liverpool
or
manchester
perhaps
and
see
what
employment
i
can
get
into
but
i
must
have
something
to
live
upon
till
i
can
get
it
i
don
t
possess
a
penny
piece
he
added
drawing
out
his
trousers
pockets
for
the
inspection
of
carlyle
the
last
coppers
i
had
three
pence
i
spent
in
bread
and
cheese
and
half
a
pint
of
beer
at
midday
i
have
been
outside
that
window
for
more
than
an
hour
indeed
and
as
i
neared
west
lynne
i
began
to
think
what
i
should
do
it
was
no
use
in
me
trying
to
catch
barbara
s
attention
such
a
night
as
this
i
had
no
money
to
pay
for
a
lodging
so
i
turned
off
here
hoping
i
might
by
good
luck
drop
upon
you
there
was
a
little
partition
in
the
window
curtain
it
had
not
been
drawn
close
and
through
it
i
could
see
you
and
miss
carlyle
i
saw
her
leave
the
room
i
saw
you
come
to
the
window
and
open
it
and
then
i
spoke
carlyle
he
added
after
a
pause
is
this
life
to
go
on
with
me
forever
i
am
deeply
sorry
for
you
richard
was
the
sympathizing
answer
i
wish
i
could
remedy
before
another
word
was
spoken
the
room
door
was
tried
and
then
gently
knocked
at
carlyle
placed
his
hand
on
richard
who
was
looking
scared
out
of
his
wits
be
still
be
at
ease
richard
no
one
shall
come
in
it
is
only
not
peter
s
voice
however
but
joyce
s
was
heard
in
response
to
carlyle
s
demand
of
who
was
there
miss
carlyle
has
left
her
handkerchief
downstairs
sir
and
has
sent
me
for
you
can
not
come
in
i
am
busy
was
the
answer
delivered
in
a
clear
and
most
decisive
tone
who
was
it
quivered
richard
as
joyce
was
heard
going
away
it
was
what
is
she
here
still
has
anything
ever
been
heard
of
afy
sir
afy
was
here
herself
two
or
three
months
was
she
though
uttered
richard
beguiled
for
an
instant
from
the
thought
of
his
own
danger
what
is
she
doing
she
is
in
service
as
a
lady
s
maid
richard
i
questioned
afy
about
thorn
she
protested
solemnly
to
me
that
it
was
not
thorn
who
committed
the
deed
that
it
could
not
have
been
he
for
thorn
was
with
her
at
the
moment
of
its
being
it
s
not
true
fired
richard
it
was
richard
you
can
not
tell
you
did
not
see
it
i
know
that
no
man
could
have
rushed
out
in
that
frantic
manner
with
those
signs
of
guilt
and
fear
about
him
unless
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
bad
deed
was
richard
hare
s
answer
it
could
have
been
no
one
afy
declared
he
was
with
her
repeated
carlyle
look
here
sir
you
are
a
sharp
man
and
folks
say
i
am
not
but
i
can
see
things
and
draw
my
reasoning
as
well
as
they
can
perhaps
if
thorn
were
not
hallijohn
s
murderer
why
should
he
be
persecuting
me
what
would
he
care
about
me
and
why
should
his
face
turn
livid
as
it
has
done
each
time
he
has
seen
my
eyes
upon
him
whether
he
did
commit
the
murder
or
whether
he
didn
t
he
must
know
that
i
did
not
because
he
came
upon
me
waiting
as
he
was
tearing
from
the
dick
s
reasoning
was
not
bad
another
thing
he
resumed
afy
swore
at
the
inquest
that
she
was
alone
when
the
deed
was
done
that
she
was
alone
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
and
knew
nothing
about
it
till
afterwards
how
could
she
have
sworn
she
was
alone
if
thorn
was
with
her
the
fact
had
entirely
escaped
carlyle
s
memory
in
his
conversation
with
afy
or
he
would
not
have
failed
to
point
out
the
discrepancy
and
to
inquire
how
she
could
reconcile
it
yet
her
assertion
to
him
had
been
most
positive
and
solemn
there
were
difficulties
in
the
matter
which
he
could
not
reconcile
now
that
i
have
got
over
my
passion
for
afy
i
can
see
her
faults
carlyle
she
d
no
more
tell
an
untruth
than
i
should
stick
a
most
awful
thundering
at
the
room
door
loud
enough
to
bring
the
very
house
down
no
officers
of
justice
searching
for
a
fugitive
ever
made
a
louder
richard
hare
his
face
turned
to
chalk
his
eyes
starting
and
his
own
light
hair
bristling
up
with
horror
struggled
into
his
wet
after
a
fashion
the
tails
up
about
his
ears
and
the
sleeves
hanging
forced
on
his
hat
and
his
false
whiskers
looked
round
in
a
bewildered
manner
for
some
cupboard
or
into
which
he
might
creep
and
seeing
none
rushed
to
the
fireplace
and
placed
his
foot
on
the
fender
that
he
purposed
an
attempt
at
was
evident
though
how
the
fire
would
have
agreed
with
his
pantaloons
not
to
speak
of
what
they
contained
poor
dick
appeared
completely
to
ignore
carlyle
drew
him
back
keeping
his
calm
powerful
hand
upon
his
shoulder
while
certain
sounds
in
an
angry
voice
were
jerked
through
the
keyhole
richard
be
a
man
put
aside
this
weakness
this
fear
have
i
not
told
you
that
harm
shall
not
come
near
you
in
my
house
it
may
be
that
officer
from
london
he
may
have
brought
half
a
dozen
more
with
him
gasped
the
unhappy
richard
i
said
they
might
have
dodged
me
all
the
way
nonsense
sit
you
down
and
be
at
rest
it
is
only
cornelia
and
she
will
be
as
anxious
to
shield
you
from
danger
as
i
can
is
it
cried
the
relieved
richard
can
t
you
make
her
keep
out
he
continued
his
teeth
still
chattering
no
that
i
can
t
if
she
has
a
mind
to
come
in
was
the
candid
answer
you
remember
what
she
was
richard
she
is
not
knowing
that
to
speak
on
this
side
the
door
to
his
sister
when
she
was
in
one
of
her
resolute
moods
would
be
of
no
use
carlyle
opened
the
door
dexterously
swung
himself
through
it
and
shut
it
after
him
there
she
stood
in
a
towering
passion
too
it
had
struck
miss
carlyle
while
undressing
that
certain
sounds
as
of
talking
proceeded
from
the
room
underneath
which
she
had
just
quitted
she
possessed
a
remarkably
keen
sense
of
hearing
did
miss
carlyle
though
indeed
none
of
her
faculties
lacked
the
quality
of
keenness
the
servants
joyce
and
peter
excepted
would
not
be
convinced
but
that
she
must
listen
but
in
that
they
did
her
injustice
first
of
all
she
believed
her
brother
must
be
reading
aloud
to
himself
but
she
soon
decided
otherwise
who
on
earth
has
he
got
in
there
with
him
quoth
miss
carlyle
she
rang
her
bell
joyce
answered
it
who
is
it
that
is
with
your
master
nobody
ma
but
i
say
there
is
i
can
hear
him
i
don
t
think
anybody
can
be
with
him
persisted
joyce
and
the
walls
of
this
house
are
too
well
built
ma
am
for
sounds
from
the
down
stairs
rooms
to
penetrate
that
s
all
you
know
about
it
cried
miss
carlyle
when
talking
goes
on
in
that
room
there
s
a
certain
sound
given
out
which
does
penetrate
here
and
which
my
ears
have
grown
accustomed
to
go
and
see
who
it
is
i
believe
i
left
my
handkerchief
on
the
table
you
can
bring
it
joyce
departed
and
miss
carlyle
proceeded
to
take
off
her
things
her
dress
first
her
silk
petticoat
next
she
had
arrived
as
far
as
the
flannel
petticoat
when
joyce
returned
yes
ma
am
some
one
is
talking
with
master
i
could
not
go
in
for
the
door
was
bolted
and
master
called
out
that
he
was
food
for
miss
carlyle
she
feeling
sure
that
no
visitor
had
come
to
the
house
ran
her
thoughts
rapidly
over
the
members
of
the
household
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be
the
governess
miss
manning
who
had
dared
to
closet
herself
with
carlyle
this
unlucky
governess
was
pretty
and
miss
carlyle
had
been
cautious
to
keep
her
and
her
prettiness
very
much
out
of
her
brother
s
sight
she
knew
the
attraction
he
would
present
to
her
visions
or
to
those
of
any
other
governess
oh
yes
it
was
miss
manning
she
had
stolen
in
believing
she
miss
carlyle
was
safe
for
the
night
but
she
d
just
unearth
my
lady
and
what
in
the
world
could
possess
archibald
to
lock
the
door
looking
round
for
something
warm
to
throw
over
her
shoulders
and
catching
up
an
article
that
looked
as
much
like
a
green
baize
cover
as
anything
else
and
throwing
it
on
down
stalked
miss
carlyle
and
in
this
trim
carlyle
beheld
her
when
he
came
out
the
figure
presented
by
miss
carlyle
to
her
brother
s
eyes
was
certainly
ridiculous
enough
she
gave
him
no
time
to
comment
upon
it
however
but
instantly
and
curtly
asked
who
have
you
got
in
that
room
it
is
some
one
on
business
was
his
prompt
reply
cornelia
you
can
not
go
she
very
nearly
laughed
not
go
in
indeed
it
is
much
better
that
you
should
not
pray
go
back
you
will
make
your
cold
worse
standing
here
now
i
want
to
know
whether
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourself
she
deliberately
pursued
you
a
married
man
with
children
in
your
house
i
d
rather
have
believed
anything
downright
wicked
of
myself
than
of
you
carlyle
stared
considerably
come
i
ll
have
her
out
and
out
of
this
house
she
tramps
morning
a
couple
of
audacious
ones
to
be
in
there
with
the
door
locked
the
moment
you
thought
you
had
got
rid
of
me
stand
aside
i
say
archibald
i
will
carlyle
never
felt
more
inclined
to
laugh
and
to
miss
carlyle
s
exceeding
discomposure
she
at
this
juncture
saw
the
governess
emerge
from
the
gray
parlor
glance
at
the
hall
clock
and
retire
again
why
she
s
there
she
uttered
i
thought
she
was
with
miss
manning
locked
in
with
me
is
that
the
mare
s
nest
cornelia
i
think
your
cold
must
have
obscured
your
well
i
shall
go
in
all
the
same
i
tell
you
archibald
that
i
will
see
who
is
if
you
persist
in
going
in
you
must
go
but
allow
me
to
warn
you
that
you
will
find
tragedy
in
that
room
not
comedy
there
is
no
woman
in
it
but
there
is
a
man
a
man
who
came
in
through
the
window
like
a
hunted
stag
a
man
upon
whom
a
ban
is
set
who
fears
the
police
are
upon
his
track
can
you
guess
his
name
it
was
miss
carlyle
s
turn
to
stare
now
she
opened
her
dry
lips
to
speak
but
they
closed
again
it
is
richard
hare
your
kinsman
there
s
not
a
roof
in
the
wide
world
open
to
him
this
bitter
she
said
nothing
a
long
pause
of
dismay
and
then
she
motioned
to
have
the
door
opened
you
will
not
show
yourself
in
in
that
guise
not
show
myself
in
this
guise
to
richard
hare
whom
i
have
whipped
when
he
was
a
child
ten
times
a
day
stand
on
ceremony
with
him
i
dare
say
he
looks
no
better
than
i
do
but
it
s
nothing
short
of
madness
archibald
for
him
to
come
he
left
her
to
enter
telling
her
to
lock
the
door
as
soon
as
she
was
inside
and
went
himself
into
the
adjoining
room
the
one
which
by
another
door
opened
to
the
one
richard
was
in
then
he
rang
the
bell
it
was
answered
by
a
footman
send
peter
to
lay
supper
here
peter
for
two
began
carlyle
when
the
old
servant
appeared
a
person
is
with
me
on
business
what
have
you
in
the
house
there
s
the
spiced
beef
sir
and
there
are
some
raised
pork
that
will
do
said
carlyle
put
a
quart
of
ale
on
the
table
and
everything
likely
to
be
wanted
and
then
the
household
can
go
to
bed
we
may
be
late
and
the
things
can
be
removed
in
the
morning
oh
and
peter
none
of
you
must
come
near
the
room
this
or
the
next
under
any
pretence
whatever
unless
i
ring
for
i
shall
be
too
busy
to
be
very
well
sir
shall
i
serve
the
ham
also
the
ham
i
beg
pardon
sir
i
guessed
it
might
be
dill
and
he
is
so
fond
of
our
ah
you
were
always
a
shrewd
guesser
peter
smiled
his
master
he
is
fond
of
ham
i
know
yes
you
may
put
it
on
the
table
don
t
forget
the
small
the
consequence
of
which
little
finesse
on
carlyle
s
part
was
that
peter
announced
in
the
kitchen
that
dill
had
arrived
and
supper
was
to
be
served
for
two
but
what
a
night
for
the
old
gentleman
to
have
trudged
through
on
foot
exclaimed
he
and
what
a
trudge
he
ll
have
of
it
back
again
for
it
ll
be
worse
then
chimed
in
one
of
the
maids
when
carlyle
got
back
in
the
other
room
his
sister
and
richard
hare
had
scarcely
finished
staring
at
each
other
please
lock
the
door
miss
cornelia
began
poor
shivering
dick
the
door
s
locked
snapped
she
but
what
on
earth
brought
you
here
richard
you
must
be
worse
than
the
officers
were
after
me
in
london
he
meekly
responded
unconsciously
using
a
term
which
had
been
familiar
to
his
boyish
years
i
had
to
cut
away
without
a
thing
belonging
to
me
without
so
much
as
a
clean
they
must
be
polite
officers
not
to
have
been
after
you
before
was
the
consolatory
remark
of
miss
carlyle
are
you
going
to
dance
a
hornpipe
through
the
streets
of
west
lynne
and
show
yourself
openly
not
if
i
can
help
it
replied
richard
you
might
just
as
well
do
that
if
you
come
to
west
lynne
at
all
for
you
can
t
be
here
now
without
being
found
out
there
was
a
bother
about
your
having
been
here
the
last
time
i
should
like
to
know
how
it
got
the
life
i
lead
is
dreadful
cried
richard
i
might
make
up
my
mind
to
toil
though
that
s
hard
after
being
reared
a
gentleman
but
to
be
an
exile
banned
disgraced
afraid
to
show
my
face
in
broad
daylight
amidst
my
fellowmen
in
dread
every
hour
that
the
sword
may
fall
i
would
almost
as
soon
be
dead
as
continue
to
live
well
you
have
got
nobody
to
grumble
at
you
brought
it
upon
yourself
philosophically
returned
miss
carlyle
as
she
opened
the
door
to
admit
her
brother
you
would
go
hunting
after
that
brazen
hussy
afy
you
know
in
defiance
of
all
that
could
be
said
to
that
would
not
have
brought
it
upon
me
said
richard
it
was
through
that
fiend
s
having
killed
hallijohn
that
was
what
brought
the
ban
upon
it
s
a
most
extraordinary
thing
if
anybody
else
did
kill
him
that
the
facts
can
t
be
brought
to
light
retorted
miss
carlyle
here
you
tell
a
story
of
some
man
s
having
done
it
some
thorn
but
nobody
ever
saw
or
heard
of
him
at
the
time
or
since
it
looks
like
a
story
dick
to
whiten
made
up
panted
richard
in
agitation
for
it
seemed
cruel
to
him
especially
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
to
have
a
doubt
cast
upon
his
tale
it
is
thorn
who
is
setting
the
officers
upon
me
i
have
seen
him
three
or
four
times
within
the
last
and
why
did
you
not
turn
the
tables
and
set
the
officers
upon
him
demanded
miss
carlyle
because
it
would
lead
to
no
good
where
s
the
proof
save
my
bare
word
that
he
committed
the
murder
miss
carlyle
rubbed
her
nose
dick
hare
said
she
well
you
know
you
always
were
the
greatest
natural
idiot
that
ever
was
let
loose
out
of
leading
i
know
i
always
was
told
and
it
s
what
you
always
will
be
if
i
were
accused
of
committing
a
crime
which
i
knew
another
had
committed
and
not
myself
should
i
be
such
an
idiot
as
not
to
give
that
other
into
custody
if
i
got
the
chance
if
you
were
not
in
such
a
cold
shivery
shaky
state
i
would
treat
you
to
a
bit
of
my
mind
you
may
rely
upon
he
was
in
league
with
afy
at
that
period
pursued
richard
a
deceitful
bad
man
and
he
carries
it
in
his
countenance
and
he
must
be
in
league
with
her
still
if
she
asserts
that
he
was
in
her
company
at
the
moment
the
murder
was
committed
carlyle
says
she
does
that
she
told
him
so
the
other
day
when
she
was
here
he
never
was
and
it
was
he
and
no
other
who
did
the
yes
burst
forth
miss
carlyle
for
the
topic
was
sure
to
agitate
her
that
jezebel
of
brass
did
presume
to
come
here
she
chose
her
time
well
and
may
thank
her
lucky
stars
i
was
not
at
home
archibald
he
s
a
fool
too
quite
as
bad
a
you
are
dick
hare
in
some
things
actually
suffered
her
to
lodge
here
for
two
days
a
vain
hussy
given
to
nothing
but
finery
and
folly
afy
said
that
she
knew
nothing
of
thorn
s
movements
now
richard
and
had
not
for
some
time
interposed
carlyle
allowing
his
sister
s
compliments
to
pass
in
silence
she
heard
a
rumor
she
thought
that
he
had
gone
abroad
with
his
so
much
the
better
for
her
if
she
does
know
nothing
of
him
sir
was
richard
s
comment
i
can
answer
for
it
that
he
is
not
abroad
but
in
and
where
are
you
going
to
lodge
abruptly
spoke
miss
carlyle
confronting
richard
i
don
t
know
was
the
answer
sighed
forth
if
i
lay
myself
down
in
a
snowdrift
and
am
found
frozen
in
the
morning
it
won
t
be
of
much
was
that
what
you
thought
of
doing
returned
miss
carlyle
no
he
mildly
said
what
i
thought
of
doing
was
to
ask
carlyle
for
the
loan
of
a
few
shillings
and
then
i
can
get
a
bed
i
know
a
place
where
i
shall
be
in
safety
two
or
three
miles
from
richard
i
would
not
turn
a
dog
out
to
go
two
or
three
miles
on
such
a
night
as
this
impulsively
uttered
carlyle
you
must
stop
indeed
i
don
t
see
how
he
is
to
get
up
to
a
bedroom
or
how
a
room
is
to
be
made
ready
for
him
for
the
matter
of
that
without
betraying
his
presence
to
the
servants
snapped
miss
carlyle
and
poor
richard
laid
his
aching
head
upon
his
hands
but
now
miss
carlyle
s
manner
was
more
in
fault
than
her
heart
will
it
be
believed
that
before
speaking
the
above
ungracious
words
before
carlyle
had
touched
upon
the
subject
she
had
been
casting
about
in
her
busy
mind
for
the
best
plan
of
keeping
richard
how
it
could
be
accomplished
one
thing
is
certain
she
resumed
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
sleep
here
without
its
being
known
to
joyce
and
i
suppose
you
and
joyce
are
upon
the
friendly
terms
of
drawing
daggers
for
she
believes
you
were
the
murderer
of
her
let
me
disabuse
her
interrupted
richard
his
pale
lips
working
as
he
started
up
allow
me
to
see
her
and
convince
her
carlyle
why
did
you
not
tell
joyce
better
there
s
that
small
room
at
the
back
of
mine
said
miss
carlyle
returning
to
the
practical
part
of
the
subject
he
might
sleep
there
but
joyce
must
be
taken
in
joyce
had
better
come
in
said
carlyle
i
will
say
a
word
to
her
he
unlocked
the
door
and
quitted
the
room
miss
carlyle
as
jealously
locked
it
again
called
to
joyce
and
beckoned
her
into
the
adjoining
apartment
he
knew
that
joyce
s
belief
in
the
guilt
of
richard
hare
was
confirmed
and
strong
but
he
must
uproot
that
belief
if
richard
was
to
be
lodged
in
his
house
that
night
joyce
he
began
you
remember
how
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
persuasion
you
were
that
afy
went
off
with
richard
hare
and
was
living
with
him
i
several
times
expressed
my
doubts
upon
the
point
the
fact
was
i
had
positive
information
that
she
was
not
with
him
and
never
had
been
though
i
considered
it
expedient
to
keep
my
information
to
myself
you
are
convinced
now
that
she
was
not
with
him
of
course
i
am
well
you
see
joyce
that
my
opinion
would
have
been
worth
listening
to
now
i
am
going
to
shake
your
belief
upon
another
point
and
if
i
assure
you
that
i
have
equally
good
grounds
for
doing
so
you
will
believe
me
i
am
quite
certain
sir
that
you
would
state
nothing
but
what
was
true
and
i
know
that
your
judgment
is
sound
was
joyce
s
answer
then
i
must
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe
it
was
richard
hare
who
murdered
your
sir
uttered
joyce
amazed
out
of
her
senses
i
believe
richard
hare
to
be
as
innocent
of
the
murder
as
you
or
i
he
deliberately
repeated
i
have
held
grounds
for
this
opinion
joyce
for
many
then
sir
who
did
it
afy
s
other
lover
that
dandy
fellow
thorn
as
i
truly
and
you
say
you
have
grounds
sir
joyce
asked
after
a
pause
good
grounds
and
i
tell
you
i
have
been
in
possession
of
them
for
years
i
should
be
glad
for
you
to
think
as
i
but
sir
if
richard
hare
was
innocent
why
did
he
run
away
ah
why
indeed
it
is
that
which
has
done
the
mischief
his
own
weak
cowardice
was
in
fault
he
feared
to
come
back
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
remove
the
odium
of
circumstances
joyce
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
and
hear
his
there
is
not
much
chance
of
that
sir
i
dare
say
he
will
never
venture
here
he
is
here
joyce
looked
up
considerably
startled
here
in
this
house
repeated
carlyle
he
has
taken
shelter
in
it
and
for
the
few
hours
that
he
will
remain
we
must
extend
our
hospitality
and
protection
to
him
concealing
him
in
the
best
manner
we
can
i
thought
it
well
that
this
confidence
should
be
reposed
in
you
joyce
come
now
and
see
considering
that
it
was
a
subdued
interview
the
voices
subdued
i
was
a
confused
one
richard
talking
vehemently
joyce
asking
question
after
question
miss
carlyle
s
tongue
going
as
fast
as
theirs
the
only
silent
one
was
carlyle
joyce
could
not
refuse
to
believe
protestations
so
solemn
and
her
suspicions
veered
round
upon
captain
thorn
and
now
about
the
bed
interjected
miss

i
wonder
joyce
made
no

to

energetic
speech
but
at
once
retired
to
prepare
the
room
for
richard
miss
carlyle
soon
followed
having
made
everything
ready
joyce
returned
the
room

she
whispered
and
all
the
household
are
in
then
now
s
your
time
richard
he
stole
upstairs
after
joyce
who
piloted
him
through
the
room
of
miss
carlyle
nothing
could
be
seen
of
that
lady
though
something
might
be
heard
one
given
to
truth
more
than
politeness
might
have
called
it

showed
richard

closed

chapter
xxx
barbara
s
heart
at
rest
morning
dawned
the
same
dull
weather
the
same
heavy
fall
of
snow
miss
carlyle
took
her
breakfast
in
bed
an
indulgence
she
had
not
favored
for
ever
so
many
years
richard
hare
rose
but
remained
in
his
chamber
and
joyce
carried
his
breakfast
in
to
him
carlyle
entered
whilst
he
was
taking
it
how
did
you
sleep
richard
i
slept
well
i
was
so
dead
tired
what
am
i
to
do
next
carlyle
the
sooner
i
get
away
from
here
the
better
i
can
t
feel
you
must
not
think
of
it
before
evening
i
am
aware
that
you
can
not
remain
here
save
for
a
few
temporary
hours
as
it
would
inevitably
become
known
to
the
servants
you
say
you
think
of
going
to
liverpool
or
manchester
to
any
large
town
they
are
all
alike
to
me
but
one
pursued
as
i
am
is
safer
in
a
large
place
than
a
small
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
man
thorn
only
made
a
show
of
threatening
you
richard
if
he
be
really
the
guilty
party
his
policy
must
be
to
keep
all
in
quietness
the
very
worst
thing
that
could
happen
for
him
would
be
your
then
why
molest
me
why
send
an
officer
to
dodge
me
he
did
not
like
your
molesting
him
and
he
thought
he
would
probably
frighten
you
after
that
day
you
would
probably
have
seen
no
more
of
the
officer
you
may
depend
upon
one
thing
richard
had
the
policeman
s
object
been
to
take
you
he
would
have
done
so
not
have
contented
himself
with
following
you
about
from
place
to
place
besides
when
a
detective
officer
is
employed
to
watch
a
party
he
takes
care
not
to
allow
himself
to
be
seen
now
this
man
showed
himself
to
you
more
than
yes
there
s
a
good
deal
in
all
that
observed
richard
for
to
one
in
his
class
of
life
the
bare
suspicion
of
such
a
crime
brought
against
him
would
crush
him
forever
in
the
eyes
of
his
it
is
difficult
to
me
richard
to
believe
that
he
is
in
the
class
of
life
you
speak
of
observed
carlyle
there
s
no
doubt
about
it
there
s
none
indeed
but
that
i
did
not
much
like
to
mention
the
name
for
it
can
t
be
a
pleasant
name
to
you
i
should
have
said
last
night
who
i
have
seen
him
walking
with
continued
richard
carlyle
looked
inquiringly
richard
say
i
have
seen
him
sir
with
sir
francis
levison
twice
once
he
was
talking
to
him
at
the
door
of
the
and
once
they
were
walking
they
are
apparently
upon
intimate
at
this
moment
a
loud
flustering
angry
voice
was
heard
calling
from
the
stairs
and
richard
leaped
up
as
if
he
had
been
shot
his
door
not
the
one
leading
to
the
room
of
miss
carlyle
opened
upon
the
corridor
and
the
voice
sounded
close
just
as
if
its
owner
were
coming
in
with
a
hound
it
was
the
voice
of
justice
hare
carlyle
where
are
you
here
s
a
pretty
thing
happened
come
down
carlyle
for
once
in
his
life
lost
his
calm
equanimity
and
sprang
to
the
door
to
keep
it
against
invasion
as
eagerly
as
richard
could
have
done
he
forgot
that
joyce
had
said
the
door
was
safely
locked
and
the
key
mislaid
as
to
richard
he
rushed
on
his
hat
and
his
black
whiskers
and
hesitated
between
under
the
bed
and
inside
the
wardrobe
don
t
agitate
yourself
richard
whispered
carlyle
there
is
no
real
danger
i
will
go
and
keep
him
but
when
carlyle
got
through
his
sister
s
bedroom
he
found
that
lady
had
taken
the
initiative
and
was
leaning
over
the
balustrades
having
been
arrested
in
the
process
of
dressing
her
clothes
were
on
but
her
nightcap
was
not
off
little
cared
she
however
who
saw
her
nightcap
what
on
earth
brings
you
up
in
this
weather
began
she
in
a
tone
of
exasperation
i
want
to
see
carlyle
nice
news
i
have
had
what
about
anything
concerning
anne
or
her
family
anne
be
bothered
replied
the
justice
who
was
from
some
cause
in
a
furious
temper
it
concerns
that
precious
rascal
who
i
am
forced
to
call
son
i
am
told
he
is
down
the
stairs
leaped
carlyle
four
at
a
time
wound
his
arm
within
hare
s
and
led
him
to
a
justice
you
had
courage
to
venture
up
through
the
snow
what
is
the
matter
you
seem
excited
raved
the
justice
dancing
about
the
room
first
on
one
leg
then
on
the
other
like
a
cat
upon
hot
bricks
so
you
would
be
excited
if
your
life
were
worried
out
as
mine
is
over
a
wicked
scamp
of
a
son
why
can
t
folks
trouble
their
heads
about
their
own
business
and
let
my
affairs
alone
a
pity
but
what
he
was
hung
and
the
thing
done
with
but
what
has
happened
questioned
carlyle
why
this
has
happened
retorted
the
justice
throwing
a
letter
on
the
table
the
post
brought
me
this
just
now
and
pleasant
information
it
carlyle
took
up
the
note
and
read
it
it
purported
to
be
from
a
friend
to
justice
hare
informing
that
gentleman
that
his
criminal
son
was
likely
to
have
arrived
at
west
lynne
or
would
arrive
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
so
and
it
recommended
hare
to
speed
his
departure
from
it
lest
he
should
be
pounced
upon
this
letter
is
anonymous
exclaimed
carlyle
of
course
it
is
stamped
the
justice
the
only
notice
i
should
ever
take
of
an
anonymous
letter
would
be
to
put
it
in
the
fire
cried
carlyle
his
lip
curling
with
scorn
but
who
has
written
it
danced
justice
hare
and
is
dick
at
west
lynne
that
s
the
now
is
it
likely
that
he
should
come
to
west
lynne
remonstrated
carlyle
justice
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
venture
to
give
you
my
candid
the
fool
at
west
lynne
running
into
the
very
jaws
of
death
by
jupiter
if
i
can
drop
upon
him
i
ll
retain
him
in
custody
and
make
out
a
warrant
for
his
committal
i
ll
have
this
everlasting
bother
i
was
going
to
give
you
my
opinion
quietly
put
in
carlyle
i
fear
justice
you
bring
these
annoyances
upon
bring
them
upon
myself
ranted
the
indignant
justice
i
did
i
murder
hallijohn
did
i
fly
away
from
the
law
am
i
hiding
beelzebub
knows
where
do
i
take
starts
right
into
my
native
parish
disguised
as
a
laborer
on
purpose
to
worry
my
own
father
do
i
write
anonymous
letters
bring
them
upon
myself
do
i
that
cobs
all
you
will
not
hear
me
out
it
is
known
that
you
are
much
exasperated
against
richard
and
if
your
son
serves
you
the
same
when
he
is
grown
up
shan
t
you
be
exasperated
pray
fired
justice
hare
do
hear
me
it
is
known
that
you
are
much
exasperated
and
that
any
allusion
to
him
excites
and
annoys
you
now
my
opinion
is
justice
that
some
busybody
is
raising
these
reports
and
writing
these
letters
on
purpose
to
annoy
you
it
may
be
somebody
at
west
lynne
very
near
to
us
for
all
we
that
s
all
rubbish
peevishly
responded
the
justice
after
a
pause
it
s
not
likely
who
d
do
it
it
is
very
likely
but
you
may
be
sure
they
will
not
give
us
a
clue
as
to
the
i
should
put
that
letter
in
the
fire
and
think
no
more
about
it
that
s
the
only
way
to
serve
them
a
pretty
laugh
they
have
had
in
their
sleeve
if
it
is
anybody
near
at
seeing
you
wade
up
here
through
the
snow
this
morning
they
would
know
you
were
bringing
the
letter
to
consult
the
justice
in
spite
of
his
obstinacy
he
was
somewhat
easily
persuaded
to
different
views
of
things
especially
by
carlyle
let
fall
his
coat
tails
which
had
been
gathered
in
his
arms
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
brought
down
both
his
hands
upon
the
table
with
force
enough
to
break
it
if
i
thought
that
he
spluttered
if
i
could
think
it
i
d
have
the
whole
parish
of
west
lynne
before
me
and
commit
them
for
it
s
a
pity
but
what
you
could
said
carlyle
well
it
may
be
or
it
may
not
be
that
that
villain
is
coming
here
he
resumed
i
shall
call
in
at
the
police
station
and
tell
them
to
keep
a
sharp
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
justice
exclaimed
carlyle
almost
in
agitation
richard
is
not
likely
to
make
his
appearance
at
west
lynne
but
if
he
did
would
you
his
own
father
turn
the
flood
upon
him
not
a
man
living
but
would
cry
shame
upon
i
took
an
oath
i
d
do
it
said
the
justice
you
did
not
take
an
oath
to
go
to
the
police
station
upon
the
receipt
of
any
despicable
anonymous
letter
or
any
foolish
report
to
say
i
have
news
that
my
son
will
be
here
look
after
nonsense
justice
let
the
police
look
out
for
themselves
but
don
t
you
set
them
the
justice
growled
whether
in
assent
or
dissent
did
not
appear
and
carlyle
resumed
have
you
shown
this
letter
to
hare
or
mentioned
it
to
her
not
i
didn
t
give
myself
time
i
had
gone
down
to
the
front
gate
to
see
how
deep
the
snow
lay
in
the
road
when
the
postman
came
up
so
i
read
it
as
i
stood
there
i
went
in
for
my
coat
and
umbrella
to
come
off
to
you
and
hare
wanted
to
know
where
i
was
going
in
such
a
hurry
but
i
did
not
satisfy
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
said
carlyle
such
information
as
this
could
not
fail
to
have
a
dangerous
effect
upon
hare
do
not
suffer
a
hint
of
it
to
escape
you
justice
consider
how
much
anxiety
she
has
already
it
s
partly
her
own
fault
why
can
t
she
drive
the
boy
from
her
mind
if
she
could
said
carlyle
she
would
be
acting
against
human
nature
there
is
one
phase
of
the
question
which
you
may
possibly
not
have
glanced
at
justice
you
speak
of
delivering
your
son
up
to
the
law
has
it
ever
struck
you
that
you
would
be
delivering
up
at
the
same
time
your
wife
s
life
stuff
said
the
justice
you
would
find
it
no
so
sure
as
richard
gets
brought
to
trial
whether
through
your
means
or
through
any
other
so
sure
will
it
kill
your
hare
took
up
the
letter
which
had
lain
open
on
the
table
folded
it
and
put
it
in
its
envelope
i
suppose
you
don
t
know
the
writing
he
asked
of
carlyle
i
never
saw
it
before
that
i
remember
are
you
returning
home
no
i
shall
go
on
to
beauchamp
s
and
show
him
this
and
hear
what
he
says
it
s
not
much
tell
him
not
to
speak
of
it
then
beauchamp
s
safe
for
his
sympathies
are
with
richard
oh
yes
they
are
justice
ask
him
the
question
plainly
if
you
like
and
he
will
confess
to
it
i
can
tell
you
more
sympathy
goes
with
richard
than
is
acknowledged
to
you
but
i
would
not
show
that
letter
to
anyone
else
than
beauchamp
added
carlyle
neither
would
i
speak
of
who
can
have
written
it
repeated
the
justice
it
bears
you
see
the
london
it
is
too
wide
a
speculation
to
enter
upon
and
no
satisfactory
conclusion
could
come
of
justice
hare
departed
carlyle
watched
him
down
the
avenue
striding
under
his
umbrella
and
then
went
up
to
richard
miss
carlyle
was
sitting
with
the
latter
then
i
thought
i
should
have
died
spoke
poor
dick
i
declare
carlyle
my
very
blood
seemed
turned
to
water
and
i
thought
i
should
have
died
with
fright
is
he
gone
away
is
all
safe
he
is
gone
and
it
s
all
and
what
did
he
want
what
was
it
he
had
heard
about
me
carlyle
gave
a
brief
explanation
and
richard
immediately
set
down
the
letter
as
the
work
of
thorn
will
it
be
possible
for
me
to
see
my
mother
this
time
he
demanded
of
carlyle
i
think
it
would
be
highly
injudicious
to
let
your
mother
know
you
are
here
or
have
been
here
was
the
answer
of
carlyle
she
would
naturally
be
inquiring
into
particulars
and
when
she
came
to
hear
that
you
were
pursued
she
would
never
have
another
minute
s
peace
you
must
forego
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
this
time
and
barbara
barbara
might
come
and
stay
the
day
with
you
only
only
what
sir
cried
richard
for
carlyle
had
hesitated
i
was
thinking
what
a
wretched
morning
it
is
for
her
to
come
out
she
would
go
through
an
avalanche
she
d
wade
through
mountains
of
snow
to
see
me
cried
richard
eagerly
and
be
delighted
to
do
she
always
was
a
little
fool
put
in
miss
carlyle
jerking
some
stitches
out
of
her
knitting
i
know
she
would
observed
carlyle
in
answer
to
richard
we
will
try
and
get
her
she
can
arrange
about
the
money
i
am
to
have
just
as
well
as
my
mother
could
you
know
yes
for
barbara
is
in
receipt
of
money
of
her
own
now
and
i
know
she
would
not
wish
better
than
to
apply
some
of
it
to
you
cornelia
as
an
excuse
for
getting
her
here
i
must
say
to
hare
that
you
are
ill
and
wish
barbara
to
come
for
the
day
and
bear
your
company
shall
i
say
i
am
dead
if
you
like
responded
miss
corny
who
was
in
one
of
her
cross
moods
carlyle
ordered
the
pony
carriage
and
drove
forth
with
john
he
drew
in
at
the
grove
barbara
and
hare
were
seated
together
and
looked
surprised
at
the
early
visit
do
you
want
hare
archibald
he
is
out
he
went
while
the
breakfast
was
on
the
table
apparently
in
a
desperate
i
don
t
want
hare
i
want
barbara
i
have
come
to
carry
her
to
carry
off
barbara
echoed
hare
cornelia
is
not
well
she
had
caught
a
violent
cold
and

face

a

to
take
cold
oh

wrap
up
and
i
will
see
that
she

all
right
this
evening
added
carlyle
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
seated
in
the
pony
carriage
barbara
s
tongue
was
burning
to
ask
questions
but
john
sat
behind
them
and
would
have
overheard
when
they
arrived
at
east
lynne
carlyle
gave
her
his
arm
up
the
steps
and
took
her
into
the
will
you
prepare
yourself
for
a
surprise
barbara
suspense
fear
had
turned
her
very
pale
something
that
has
happened
to
richard
she
uttered
nothing
that
need
agitate
you
he
is
here
where
here
under
this
roof
he
slept
here
last
oh
archibald
only
fancy
barbara
i
opened
the
window
at
nine
last
night
to
look
at
the
weather
and
in
burst
richard
we
could
not
let
him
go
out
again
in
the
snow
so
he
slept
here
in
that
room
next
cornelia
does
she
know
of
it
of
course
and
joyce
also
we
were
obliged
to
tell
joyce
it
is
he
you
have
come
to
spend
the
day
with
but
just
imagine
richard
s
fear
your
father
came
this
morning
calling
up
the
stairs
after
me
saying
he
heard
richard
was
here
i
thought
richard
would
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
with
a
few
more
explanations
and
carlyle
took
barbara
into
the
room
miss
carlyle
and
her
knitting
still
keeping
richard
company
in
fact
that
was
to
be
the
general
sitting
room
of
the
day
and
a
hot
lunch
richard
s
dinner
would
be
served
to
miss
carlyle
s
chamber
at
one
o
clock
joyce
only
admitted
to
wait
on
her
and
now
i
must
go
said
carlyle
after
chatting
a
few
minutes
the
office
is
waiting
for
me
and
my
poor
ponies
are
in
the
but
you
ll
be
sure
to
be
home
early
carlyle
said
richard
i
dare
not
stop
here
i
must
be
off
not
a
moment
later
than
six
or
seven
o
i
will
be
home
anxiously
did
richard
and
barbara
consult
that
day
miss
carlyle
of
course
putting
in
her
word
over
and
over
again
did
barbara
ask
the
particulars
of
the
slight
interviews
richard
had
had
with
thorn
over
and
over
again
did
she
openly
speculate
upon
what
his
name
really
was
if
you
could
but
discover
some
one
whom
he
knows
and
inquire
it
she
exclaimed
i
have
seen
him
with
one
person
but
i
can
t
inquire
of
him
they
are
too
thick
together
he
and
thorn
and
are
birds
of
a
feather
also
i
suspect
great
swells
oh
richard
don
t
use
those
expressions
they
are
unsuited
to
a
richard
laughed
bitterly
a
gentleman
who
is
it
you
have
seen
thorn
with
inquired
barbara
sir
francis
levison
replied
richard
glancing
at
miss
carlyle
who
drew
in
her
lips
ominously
with
whom
uttered
barbara
betraying
complete
astonishment
do
you
know
sir
francis
levison
oh
yes
i
know
him
nearly
the
only
man
about
town
that
i
do
barbara
seemed
lost
in
a
puzzled
reverie
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
aroused
herself
from
it
are
they
at
all
alike
she
asked
very
much
so
i
suspect
both
bad
but
i
meant
in
not
in
the
least
except
that
they
are
both
again
barbara
sank
into
thought
richard
s
words
had
surprised
her
she
was
aroused
by
it
from
hearing
a
child
s
voice
in
the
next
room
she
ran
into
it
and
miss
carlyle
immediately
fastened
the
intervening
door
it
was
little
archibald
carlyle
joyce
had
come
in
with
the
tray
to
lay
the
luncheon
and
before
she
could
lock
the
door
archibald
ran
in
after
her
barbara
lifted
him
in
her
arms
to
carry
him
back
to
the
nursery
oh
you
heavy
boy
she
exclaimed
archie
laughed
wilson
says
that
he
lisped
if
ever
she
has
to
carry
i
have
brought
you
a
truant
wilson
cried
barbara
oh
is
it
you
miss
barbara
how
are
you
miss
naughty
boy
yes
he
ran
away
without
my
noticing
him
he
is
got
now
so
that
he
can
open
the
you
must
be
so
kind
as
to
keep
him
strictly
in
for
concluded
miss
barbara
authoritatively
miss
carlyle
is
not
well
and
can
not
be
subjected
to
the
annoyance
of
his
running
into
the
evening
came
and
the
time
of
richard
s
departure
it
was
again
snowing
heavily
though
it
had
ceased
in
the
middle
of
the
day
money
for
the
present
had
been
given
to
him
arrangements
had
been
discussed
carlyle
insisted
upon
richard
s
sending
him
his
address
as
soon
as
he
should
own
one
to
send
and
richard
faithfully
promised
he
was
in
very
low
spirits
almost
as
low
as
barbara
who
could
not
conceal
her
tears
they
dropped
in
silence
on
her
pretty
silk
dress
he
was
smuggled
down
the
stairs
a
large
cloak
of
miss
carlyle
s
enveloping
him
into
the
room
he
had
entered
by
storm
the
previous
night
carlyle
held
the
window
open
barbara
dear
if
ever
you
should
be
able
to
tell
my
mother
of
this
day
say
that
my
chief
sorrow
was
not
to
see
oh
richard
she
sobbed
forth
may
god
be
with
you
and
bless
you
farewell
richard
said
miss
carlyle
don
t
you
be
fool
enough
to
get
into
any
more
last
of
all
he
rung
the
hand
of
carlyle
the
latter
went
outside
with
him
for
an
instant
and
their
was
alone
barbara
returned
to
the
chamber
he
had
quitted
she
felt
that
she
must
indulge
in
a
few
moments
sobbing
joyce
was
there
but
barbara
was
sobbing
when
she
entered
it
it
is
hard
for
him
miss
barbara
if
he
is
really
barbara
turned
her
streaming
eyes
upon
her
if
joyce
do
you
doubt
that
he
is
innocent
i
quite
believe
him
to
be
so
now
miss
nobody
could
so
solemnly
assert
what
was
not
true
the
thing
at
present
will
be
to
find
that
captain
joyce
exclaimed
barbara
in
excitement
seizing
hold
of
joyce
s
hands
i
thought
i
had
found
him
i
believed
in
my
own
mind
that
i
knew
who
he
was
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
though
i
have
never
before
spoken
of
it
and
with
one
thing
or
other
this
night
i
feel
just
as
if
i
should
die
as
if
i
must
speak
i
thought
it
was
sir
francis
joyce
stared
with
all
her
eyes
miss
barbara
i
did
i
have
thought
it
ever
since
the
night
that
lady
isabel
went
away
my
poor
brother
was
at
west
lynne
then
he
had
come
for
a
few
hours
and
he
met
the
man
thorn
walking
in
bean
lane
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
richard
described
a
peculiar
motion
of
his
the
throwing
off
of
his
hair
from
his
brow
he
said
his
white
hand
and
his
diamond
ring
glittered
in
the
moonlight
the
white
hand
the
ring
the
motion
for
he
was
always
doing
it
all
reminded
me
of
captain
levison
and
from
that
hour
until
i
believed
him
to
be
the
man
richard
saw
richard
tells
me
that
he
knows
sir
francis
levison
and
that
he
and
thorn
are
intimate
what
i
think
now
is
that
this
thorn
must
have
paid
a
flying
visit
to
the
neighborhood
that
night
to
assist
captain
levison
in
the
wicked
work
that
he
had
on
how
strange
it
all
sounds
uttered
joyce
and
i
never
could
tell
my
suspicions
to
carlyle
i
did
not
like
to
mention
francis
levison
s
name
to
barbara
soon
returned
down
stairs
i
must
be
going
home
she
said
to
carlyle
it
is
turned
seven
and
mamma
will
be
whenever
you
like
but
can
i
not
walk
i
am
sorry
to
take
out
your
ponies
again
and
in
this
carlyle
laughed
which
would
feel
the
storm
the
worst
you
or
the
ponies
but
when
barbara
got
outside
she
saw
that
it
was
not
the
pony
carriage
but
the
chariot
that
was
in
waiting
for
her
she
turned
inquiringly
to
carlyle
did
you
think
i
should
allow
you
to
go
home
in
an
open
carriage
night
barbara
are
you
coming
also
i
suppose
i
had
better
he
smiled
to
see
that
you
and
the
carriage
do
not
get
fixed
in
a
barbara
withdrew
to
her
corner
of
the
chariot
and
cried
silently
very
very
deeply
did
she
mourn
the
unhappy
situation
the
privations
of
her
brother
and
she
knew
that
he
was
one
to
feel
them
deeply
he
could
not
battle
with
the
world
s
hardships
so
bravely
as
many
could
carlyle
only
detected
her
emotion
as
they
were
nearing
the
grove
he
leaned
forward
took
her
hand
and
held
it
between
his
don
t
grieve
barbara
bright
days
may
be
in
store
for
us
the
carriage
stopped
you
may
go
back
he
said
to
the
servants
when
he
alighted
i
shall
walk
oh
exclaimed
barbara
i
do
think
you
intend
to
spend
the
evening
with
us
mamma
will
be
so
her
voice
sounded
as
if
she
was
also
carlyle
drew
her
hand
within
his
arm
as
they
walked
up
the
path
but
barbara
had
reckoned
without
her
host
hare
was
in
bed
consequently
could
not
be
pleased
at
the
visit
of
carlyle
the
justice
had
gone
out
and
she
feeling
tired
and
not
well
thought
she
would
retire
to
rest
barbara
stole
into
her
room
but
found
her
asleep
so
that
it
fell
to
barbara
to
entertain
carlyle
they
stood
together
before
the
large
pierglass
in
front
of
the
blazing
fire
barbara
was
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
what
carlyle
was
thinking
of
was
best
known
to
himself
his
eyes
covered
with
their
drooping
eyelids
were
cast
upon
barbara
there
was
a
long
silence
at
length
barbara
seemed
to
feel
that
his
gaze
was
upon
her
and
she
looked
up
at
him
will
you
marry
me
barbara
the
words
were
spoken
in
the
quietest
most
tone
just
as
if
he
had
said
shall
i
give
you
a
chair
barbara
but
oh
the
change
that
passed
over
her
countenance
the
sudden
light
of
joy
the
scarlet
flush
of
emotion
and
happiness
then
it
all
faded
down
to
paleness
and
sadness
she
shook
her
head
in
the
negative
but
you
are
very
kind
to
ask
me
she
added
in
words
what
is
the
impediment
barbara
another
rush
of
color
as
before
and
a
deep
silence
carlyle
stole
his
arm
around
her
and
bent
his
face
on
a
level
with
hers
whisper
it
to
me
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
is
it
because
i
once
married
another
no
no
it
is
the
remembrance
of
that
night
you
can
not
have
forgotten
it
and
it
is
stamped
on
my
brain
in
letters
of
fire
i
never
thought
so
to
betray
myself
but
for
what
passed
that
night
you
would
not
have
asked
me
barbara
she
glanced
up
at
him
the
tone
was
so
painful
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
that
there
is
none
other
in
the
whole
world
whom
i
would
care
to
marry
but
you
nay
barbara
when
happiness
is
within
our
reach
let
us
not
throw
it
away
upon
a
she
cried
more
softly
leaning
upon
his
arm
happiness
would
it
be
happiness
for
you
great
and
deep
happiness
he
whispered
she
read
truth
in
his
countenance
and
a
sweet
smile
illumined
her
sunny
features
carlyle
read
its
signs
you
love
me
as
much
as
ever
barbara
far
more
far
more
was
the
murmured
answer
and
carlyle
held
her
closer
and
drew
her
face
fondly
to
his
barbara
s
heart
was
at
length
at
rest
and
she
had
been
content
to
remain
where
she
was
forever
and
richard
had
he
got
clear
off
richard
was
stealing
along
the
road
plunging
into
the
snow
by
the
hedge
because
it
was
more
sheltered
there
than
in
the
beaten
path
when
his
umbrella
came
in
contact
with
another
umbrella
miss
carlyle
had
furnished
it
to
him
not
to
protect
his
battered
hat
but
to
protect
his
face
from
being
seen
by
the
passers
by
the
umbrella
he
encountered
was
an
aristocratic
silk
one
with
an
ivory
handle
dick
s
was
of
democratic
cotton
with
hardly
any
handle
at
all
and
the
respective
owners
had
been
bearing
on
heads
down
and
umbrellas
out
till
they
the
umbrellas
met
smash
right
under
a
gas
lamp
aside
went
the
umbrellas
and
the
antagonists
stared
at
each
other
how
dare
you
fellow
can
t
you
see
where
you
are
going
on
dick
thought
he
should
have
dropped
he
would
have
given
all
the
money
his
pockets
held
if
the
friendly
earth
had
but
opened
and
swallowed
him
in
for
he
was
now
peering
into
the
face
of
his
own
father
uttering
an
exclamation
of
dismay
which
broke
from
him
involuntarily
richard
sped
away
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
did
justice
hare
recognize
the
tones
it
can
not
be
said
he
saw
a
rough
strange
looking
man
with
bushy
black
whiskers
who
was
evidently
scared
at
the
sight
of
him
that
was
nothing
for
the
justice
being
a
justice
and
a
strict
one
was
regarded
with
considerable
awe
in
the
parish
by
those
of
dick
s
apparent
caliber
nevertheless
he
stood
still
and
gazed
in
the
direction
until
all
sound
of
richard
s
footsteps
had
died
away
in
the
distance
tears
were
streaming
down
the
face
of
hare
it
was
a
bright
morning
after
the
snowstorm
so
bright
that
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sun
was
shining
but
the
snow
lay
deeply
upon
ground
hare
sat
in
her
chair
enjoying
the
brightness
and
carlyle
stood
near
her
the
tears
were
of
joy
and
of
grief
mingled
of
grief
at
hearing
that
she
should
at
last
have
to
part
with
barbara
of
joy
that
she
was
going
to
one
so
entirely
worthy
of
her
as
carlyle
archibald
she
has
had
a
happy
home
here
you
will
render
yours
as
much
so
to
the
very
utmost
of
my
you
will
be
ever
kind
to
her
and
cherish
her
with
my
whole
strength
and
heart
dear
hare
i
thought
you
knew
me
too
well
to
doubt
doubt
you
i
do
not
doubt
you
i
trust
you
implicitly
archibald
had
the
whole
world
laid
themselves
at
barbara
s
feet
i
should
have
prayed
that
she
might
choose
a
small
smile
flitted
over
carlyle
s
lips
he
knew
it
was
what
barbara
would
have
done
but
archibald
what
about
cornelia
returned
hare
i
would
not
for
a
moment
interfere
in
your
affairs
or
in
the
arrangements
you
and
barbara
may
agree
upon
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
married
people
are
better

quit
east
lynne
said
carlyle
i
have
not
spoken
to
her
yet
but
i
shall
do
so
now
i
have
long
made
my
mind
up
that
if
ever
i
did
marry
again
i
and
my
wife
would
live
alone
it
is
said
she
interfered
too
much
with
my
former
wife
had
i
suspected
it
cornelia
should
not
have
remained
in
the
house
a
day
rest
assured
that
barbara
shall
not
be
an
object
to
the
how
did
you
come
over
her
demanded
the
justice
who
had
already
given
his
gratified
consent
and
who
now
entered
in
his
dressing
gown
and
morning
wig
others
have
tried
it
on
and
barbara
would
not
listen
to
i
suppose
i
must
have
cast
a
spell
upon
her
answered
carlyle
breaking
into
a
smile
here
she
is
barbara
carried
on
the
unceremonious
justice
what
is
it
that
you
see
in
carlyle
more
than
anybody
else
barbara

scarlet
cheeks
answered
for
her
papa
she
said
otway
bethel
is
at
the
door
asking
to
speak
to
you
jasper

come
then

not
going
out
to
him
in
the
cold
here
otway
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
called
out
come
otway
bethel
made
his
appearance
in
his
usual
sporting
costume
but
he
did
not
seem
altogether
at
his
ease
in
the
presence
of
hare
and
barbara
the
colonel
wished
to
see
you
justice
and
ask
you
if
you
had
any
objection
to
the
meeting
s
being
put
off
from
one
o
clock
till
two
cried
he
after
nodding
to
carlyle
he
has
got
a
friend
coming
to
see
him
unexpectedly
who
will
leave
again
by
the
two
o
clock
i
don
t
care
which
it
is
answered
hare
two
o
clock
will
do
as
well
as
one
for
that
s
all
right
then
and
i
ll
drop
in
upon
herbert
and
pinner
and
acquaint
miss
carlyle
s
cold
was
better
that
evening
in
fact
she
seemed
quite
herself
again
and
carlyle
introduced
the
subject
of
his
marriage
it
was
after
dinner
that
he
began
upon
it
cornelia
when
i
married
lady
isabel
vane
you
reproached
me
severely
with
having
kept
you
in
the
dark
if
you
had
not
kept
me
in
the
dark
but
consulted
me
as
any
other
christian
would
the
course
of
events
would
have
been
wholly
changed
and
the
wretchedness
and
disgrace
that
fell
on
this
house
been
spared
to
it
fiercely
interrupted
miss
carlyle
we
will
leave
the
past
he
said
and
consider
the
future
i
was
about
to
remark
that
i
do
not
intend
to
fall
under
your
displeasure
again
for
the
like
offense
i
believe
you
have
never
wholly
forgiven
and
never
shall
cried
she
impetuously
i
did
not
deserve
the
therefore
almost
as
soon
as
i
know
it
myself
i
acquaint
you
i
am
about
to
marry
a
second
time
miss
carlyle
started
up
her
spectacles
dropped
off
her
nose
and
a
which
she
happened
to
have
on
her
knees
clattered
to
the
floor
what
did
you
say
she
uttered
aghast
i
m
about
to
you
i
is
there
anything
so
very
astonishing
in
it
for
the
love
of
common
sense
don
t
go
and
make
such
a
fool
of
yourself
you
have
done
it
once
was
not
that
enough
for
you
but
you
must
run
your
head
into
the
noose
again
now
cornelia
can
you
wonder
that
i
do
not
speak
of
things
when
you
meet
them
in
this
way
you
treat
me
just
as
you
did
when
i
was
a
child
it
is
very
when
folk
act
childishly
they
must
be
treated
as
children
i
always
thought
you
were
mad
when
you
married
before
but
i
shall
think
you
doubly
mad
because
you
have
preferred
to
remain
single
and
solitary
yourself
is
it
any
reason
why
you
should
condemn
me
to
do
the
same
you
are
happy
alone
i
should
be
happier
with
a
that
she
may
go
and
disgrace
you
as
the
last
one
did
intemperately
spoke
miss
carlyle
caring
not
a
rush
what
she
said
in
her
storm
of
anger
carlyle
s
brow
flushed
but
he
controlled
his
temper
no
he
calmly
replied
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
in
the
one
i
have
now
miss
corny
gathered
her
knitting
together
he
had
picked
up
her
box
her
hands
trembled
and
the
lines
of
her
face
were
working
it
was
a
blow
to
her
as
keen
as
the
other
had
been
pray
who
is
it
that
you
have
chosen
she
jerked
forth
the
whole
neighborhood
has
been
after
let
it
be
who
it
will
cornelia
you
will
be
sure
to
grumble
were
i
to
say
that
it
was
a
royal
princess
or
a
peasant
s
daughter
you
would
equally
see
grounds
for
finding
of
course
i
should
i
know
who
it
is
that
louisa
no
it
is
not
i
never
had
the
slightest
intention
of
choosing
louisa
dobede
nor
she
of
choosing
me
i
am
marrying
to
please
myself
and
for
a
wife
louisa
dobede
would
not
please
as
you
did
before
sarcastically
put
in
miss
corny
yes
as
i
did
well
can
t
you
open
your
mouth
and
say
who
it
is
was
the
exasperated
rejoinder
it
is
barbara
who
shrieked
miss
carlyle
you
are
not
deaf
well
you
are
an
idiot
she
exclaimed
lifting
up
her
hands
and
eyes
thank
you
he
said
but
without
any
signs
of
irritation
and
so
you
are
you
are
archibald
to
suffer
that
girl
who
has
been
angling
after
you
so
long
to
catch
you
at
she
has
not
angled
after
me
had
she
done
so
she
would
probably
never
have
been
carlyle
whatever
passing
fancy
she
may
have
entertained
for
me
in
earlier
days
she
has
shown
no
symptoms
of
it
of
late
years
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
she
had
no
more
thought
or
idea
that
i
should
choose
her
for
my
second
wife
than
you
had
i
should
choose
you
others
have
angled
after
me
too
palpably
but
barbara
has
she
is
a
conceited
minx
as
vain
as
she
is
what
else
have
you
to
urge
against
her
i
would
have
married
a
girl
without
a
slur
if
i
must
have
married
aggravatingly
returned
miss
corny
slur
slur
yes
dear
me
is
it
an
honor
the
possessing
a
brother
such
as
richard
miss
corny
sniffed
pigs
may
fly
but
i
never
saw
them
try
at
the
next
consideration
cornelia
is
about
your
residence
you
will
go
back
i
presume
to
your
own
miss
corny
did
not
believe
her
own
ears
go
back
to
my
own
home
she
exclaimed
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
shall
stop
at
east
lynne
what
s
to
hinder
me
carlyle
shook
his
head
it
can
not
be
he
said
in
a
low
decisive
tone
who
says
so
she
sharply
asked
i
do
have
you
forgotten
that
night
when
she
went
away
the
words
spoken
by
joyce
cornelia
whether
they
were
true
or
false
i
will
not
subject
another
to
the
she
did
not
answer
her
lips
parted
and
closed
again
somehow
miss
carlyle
could
not
bear
to
be
reminded
of
that
revelation
of
joyce
s
it
subdued
even
her
i
cast
no
reflection
upon
you
hastily
continued
carlyle
you
have
been
a
mistress
of
a
house
for
many
years
and
you
naturally
look
to
be
so
it
is
right
you
should
but
two
mistresses
in
a
house
do
not
answer
cornelia
they
never
did
and
they
never
why
did
you
not
give
me
so
much
of
your
sentiments
when
i
first
came
to
east
lynne
she
burst
forth
i
hate
they
were
not
my
sentiments
then
i
possessed
none
i
was
ignorant
upon
the
subject
as
i
was
upon
many
others
experience
has
come
to
me
you
will
not
find
a
better
mistress
of
a
house
than
i
have
made
you
she
resentfully
spoke
i
do
not
look
for
it
the
tenants
leave
your
house
in
march
do
they
not
yes
they
do
snapped
miss
corny
but
as
we
are
on
the
subject
of
details
of
ways
and
means
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
if
you
did
what
is
right
you
would
move
into
that
house
of
mine
and
i
will
go
to
a
smaller
as
you
seem
to
think
i
shall
poison
barbara
if
i
remain
with
her
east
lynne
is
a
vast
deal
too
fine
and
too
grand
for
i
do
not
consider
it
so
i
shall
not
quit
east
are
you
aware
that
in
leaving
your
house
i
take
my
income
with
me
archibald
most
certainly
your
income
is
yours
and
you
will
require
it
for
your
own
purposes
i
have
neither
a
right
to
nor
wish
for
it
will
make
a
pretty
good
hole
in
your
income
the
withdrawing
of
it
i
can
tell
you
that
take
care
that
you
and
east
lynne
don
t
go
bankrupt
at
this
moment
the
summons
of
a
visitor
was
heard
even
that
excited
the
ire
of
miss
carlyle
i
wonder
who
s
come
bothering
she
uttered
peter
entered
it
is
major
thorn
sir
i
have
shown
him
into
the
carlyle
was
surprised
he
had
not
thought
major
thorn
within
many
a
mile
of
west
lynne
he
proceeded
to
the
such
a
journey
said
major
thorn
to
carlyle
it
is
my
general
luck
to
get
when
i
travel
rain
and
hail
thunder
and
heat
nothing
bad
comes
amiss
when
i
am
out
the
snow
lay
on
the
rails
i
don
t
know
how
thick
at
one
station
we
were
detained
two
are
you
proposing
to
make
any
stay
at
west
lynne
off
again
my
leave
this
time
is
to
be
spent
at
my
mother
s
i
may
bestow
a
week
of
it
or
so
on
west
lynne
but
am
not
sure
i
must
be
back
in
ireland
in
a
month
such
a
horrid
boghole
we
are
quartered
in
just
now
to
go
from
one
subject
to
another
observed
carlyle
there
is
a
question
i
have
long
thought
to
put
to
you
thorn
did
we
ever
meet
again
which
year
was
it
that
you
were
staying
at
swainson
major
thorn
mentioned
it
it
was
the
year
of
hallijohn
s
murder
as
i
thought
in
fact
know
said
carlyle
did
you
while
you
were
stopping
there
ever
come
across
a
namesake
of
yours
one
thorn
i
believe
i
did
but
i
don
t
know
the
man
of
my
knowledge
and
i
saw
him
but
once
only
i
don
t
think
he
was
living
at
swainson
i
never
observed
him
in
the
where
did
you
meet
with
him
at
a
roadside
about
two
miles
from
swainson
i
was
riding
one
day
when
a
fearful
storm
came
on
and
i
took
shelter
there
scarcely
had
i
entered
when
another
horsemen
rode
up
and
he
likewise
took
shelter
a
tall
dandified
man
aristocratic
and
exclusive
when
he
departed
for
he
quitted
first
the
storm
being
over
i
asked
the
people
who
he
was
they
said
they
did
not
know
though
they
had
often
seen
him
ride
by
but
a
man
who
was
there
drinking
said
he
was
a
captain
thorn
the
same
man
by
the
way
volunteered
the
information
that
he
came
from
a
distance
somewhere
near
west
lynne
i
remember
that
captain
thorn
did
no
that
he
himself
did
he
appeared
to
know
nothing
of
captain
thorn
beyond
the
it
seemed
to
be
ever
so
scraps
of
information
but
nothing
tangible
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
or
to
know
the
man
by
would
it
be
thus
always
should
you
recognize
him
again
were
you
to
see
him
resumed
carlyle
awakening
from
his
reverie
i
think
i
should
there
was
something
peculiar
in
his
countenance
and
i
remember
it
well
were
you
by
chance
to
meet
him
and
discover
his
real
name
for
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
thorn
the
one
he
went
by
then
was
an
assumed
one
will
you
oblige
me
by
letting
me
know
it
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
replied
the
major
the
chances
are
against
it
though
confined
as
i
am
to
that
confounded
sister
country
other
regiments
get
the
luck
of
being
quartered
in
the
metropolis
or
near
it
ours
doesn
when
major
thorn
departed
and
carlyle
was
about
to
return
to
the
room
where
he
left
his
sister
he
was
interrupted
by
joyce
sir
she
began
miss
carlyle
tells
me
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
change
at
east
the
words
took
carlyle
by
surprise
miss
carlyle
has
been
in
a
hurry
to
tell
you
he
remarked
a
certain
haughty
displeasure
in
his
tone
she
did
not
speak
for
the
sake
of
telling
me
sir
it
is
not
likely
but
i
fancy
she
was
thinking
about
her
own
plans
she
inquired
whether
i
would
go
with
her
when
she
left
or
whether
i
meant
to
remain
at
east
lynne
i
would
not
answer
her
sir
until
i
had
spoken
to
well
said
carlyle
i
gave
a
promise
sir
to
to
my
late
lady
that
i
would
remain
with
her
children
as
long
as
i
was
permitted
she
asked
it
of
me
when
she
was
ill
when
she
thought
she
was
going
to
die
what
i
would
inquire
of
you
sir
is
whether
the
change
will
make
any
difference
to
my
staying
no
he
decisively
replied
i
also
joyce
wish
you
to
remain
with
the
it
is
well
sir
joyce
answered
and
her
face
looked
bright
as
she
quitted
the
room

made
herself
into
a
sort
of
martyr
she
would
not

fine
weddings
in
fine
churches
did
not
suit

she
proclaimed
they
could
tie
themselves
up

enough

presence
she
had
invited
the
little
carlyles
and
their
governess
and
joyce
to
spend
the
day
with
her
and
she
persisted
in
regarding

to

of

committed
himself
terribly
on
the
wedding
morning
about
ten
o
clock
he
made
his
appearance
at
miss
carlyle
s
he
was
a
man
of
the
old
stage
possessing
notions
and
he
had
deemed
that
to
step
in
to
congratulate
her
on
the
auspicious
day
would
be

good
manners
miss

seated
in

sarcastic
wrath

echoed
she
i

a

gold

forming
a
tail
after
you

covet
a
wreath
of
embroidery
round
it
gold
leaves
and
scarlet
flowers
with
a
swansdown
collar
it
would
only
be
in
keeping
with
that
shirt
and
waistcoat
i
might
as
well
have
gone
and
ordered
a
white
tarletan
dress
looped
up
with
peas
and
streamed
through
the
town
in
that
guise
it
would
be
just
as
people
like
to
dress
a
little
out
of
common
at
a
wedding
miss
cornelia
it
s
only
respectful
when
they
are
invited
i
don
t
say
people
should
go
to
a
wedding
in
a
hop
sack
but
there
s
a
medium
pray
do
you
know
your
age
i
am
turned
sixty
miss
you
just
are
and
do
you
consider
it
decent
for
an
old
man
going
on
for
seventy
to
be
decorated
off
as
you
are
now
i
don
t
and
so
i
tell
you
my
mind
why
you
ll
be
the
of
the
parish
take
care
the
boys
don
t
tie
a
tin
kettle
to
you
dill
thought
he
would
leave
the
subject
his
own
impression
was
that
he
was
not
too
fine
and
that
the
parish
would
not
regard
him
as
being
so
still
he
had
a
great
reverence
for
miss
corny
s
judgment
and
was
not
altogether
easy
he
had
had
his
white
gloves
in
his
hand
when
he
entered
but
he
surreptitiously
smuggled
them
into
his
pocket
lest
they
might
offend
he
passed
to
the
subject
which
had
brought
him
thither
what
i
came
in
for
was
to
offer
you
my
congratulations
on
this
auspicious
day
miss
cornelia
i
hope
archibald
and
his
wife
and
you
ma
am
there
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
go
on
interrupted
miss
corny
hotly
arresting
him
we
want
condolence
here
rather
than
the
other
thing
i
m
sure
i
d
nearly
as
soon
see
archibald
go
to
his
oh
miss
corny
i
would
and
you
need
not
stare
at
me
as
if
you
were
throttled
what
business
has
he
to
go
and
fetter
himself
with
a
wife
again
one
would
have
thought
he
had
had
enough
with
the
other
it
is
as
i
have
always
said
there
s
a
soft
place
in
archibald
s
old
dill
knew
there
was
no
soft
place
in
the
brain
of
carlyle
but
he
deemed
it
might
be
as
well
not
to
say
so
in
miss
corny
s
present
humor
marriage
is
a
happy
state
as
i
have
heard
ma
am
and
honorable
and
i
am
sure
archibald
very
happy
very
honorable
fiercely
cried
miss
carlyle
sarcasm
in
her
tone
his
last
marriage
brought
him
all
that
did
it
not
that
s
past
and
done
with
miss
corny
and
none
of
us
need
recall
it
i
hope
he
will
find
in
his
present
wife
a
recompense
for
what
s
gone
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
prettier
or
nicer
young
lady
than
miss
barbara
and
i
am
glad
to
my
very
heart
that
he
has
got
couldn
t
he
jerked
miss
carlyle
no
ma
am
he
could
not
were
i
young
and
wanted
a
wife
there
s
no
one
in
all
west
lynne
i
would
so
soon
look
out
for
as
miss
barbara
not
that
she

me
and
i
was
not
speaking
in
that
sense
miss
it
s
to
be
hoped
you
were
not
retorted
miss
corny
she
is
an
idle
insolent
vain
fagot
caring
for
nothing
but
her
own
doll
s
face
and
for
ah
well
ma
am
never
mind
that
pretty
young
girls
know
they
are
pretty
and
you
can
t
take
their
vanity
from
them
she
ll
be
a
good
and
loving
wife
to
him
i
know
she
will
it
is
in
her
nature
she
won
t
serve
him
as
as
that
other
poor
unfortunate
if
i
feared
she
was
one
to
bring
shame
to
him
as
the
other
did
i
d
go
into
the
church
this
hour
and
forbid
the
marriage
and
if
that
didn
t
do
i
d
smother
her
shrieked
miss
carlyle
look
at
that
piece
of
impudence
that
last
sentence
was
uttered
in
a
different
tone
and
concerned
somebody
in
the
street
miss
carlyle
hopped
off
her
chair
and
strode
to
the
window
dill
s
eyes
turned
in
the
like
direction
in
a
gay
and
summer
s
dress
fine
and
sparkling
with
a
coquettish
little
bonnet
trimmed
with
pink
shaded
by
one
of
those
nondescript
articles
at
present
called
veils
which
article
was
made
of
white
spotted
net
with
a
pink
ruche
round
it
sailed
afy
hallijohn
conceited
and
foolish
and
as
ever
catching
sight
of
dill
she
made
him
a
flourishing
and
gracious
bow
the
courteous
old
gentleman
returned
it
and
was
pounced
upon
by
miss
corny
s
tongue
for
his
pains
whatever
possessed
you
to
do
that
well
miss
corny
she
spoke
to
me
you
saw
i
saw
her
yes
i
did
see
her
the
brazen
bellwether
and
she
saw
me
and
spoke
to
you
in
her
insolence
and
you
must
answer
her
in
spite
of
my
presence
instead
of
shaking
your
fist
and
giving
her
a
reproving
frown
you
want
a
little
sharp
talking
to
but
miss
corny
it
s
always
best
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
he
pleaded
she
was
flighty
and
foolish
and
all
that
was
afy
but
now
that
it
s
proved
she
did
not
go
with
richard
hare
as
was
suspected
and
is
at
present
living
creditably
why
should
she
not
be
noticed
if
the
very
deuce
himself
stood
there
with
his
horns
and
tail
you
would
find
excuses
to
make
for
him
fired
miss
corny
you
are
as
bad
as
archibald
notice
afy
hallijohn
when
she
dresses
and
flirts
and
minces
as
you
saw
her
but
now
what
creditable
servant
would
flaunt
abroad
in
such
a
dress
and
bonnet
as
that
with
that
flimsy
gauze
thing
over
her
face
it
s
as
disreputable
as
your
dill
coughed
humbly
not
wishing
to
renew
the
point
of
the
front
she
is
not
exactly
a
servant
miss
corny
she
s
a
lady
s
maid
and
ladies
maids
do
dress
outrageously
fine
i
had
great
respect
for
her
father
ma
am
never
a
better
clerk
came
into
our
perhaps
you
ll
tell
me
you
have
a
respect
for
her
the
world
s
being
turned
upside
down
i
think
formerly
mistresses
kept
their
servants
to
work
now
it
seems
they
keep
them
for
play
she
s
going
to
jude
s
you
may
be
sure
of
it
to
stare
at
this
fine
wedding
instead
of
being
at
home
in
a
cotton
gown
and
white
apron
making
beds
latimer
must
be
a
droll
mistress
to
give
her
liberty
in
this
way
what
s
that
fly
for
sharply
added
miss
corny
as
one
drew
up
to
the
office
door
fly
said
dill
stretching
forward
his
bald
head
it
must
be
the
one
i
ordered
then
i
ll
wish
you
miss
fly
for
you
cried
miss
corny
have
you
got
the
gout
that
you
could
not
walk
to
jude
s
on
foot
i
am
not
going
to
the
church
yet
i
am
going
on
to
the
grove
miss
corny
i
thought
it
would
look
more
proper
to
have
a
fly
ma
am
more
not
a
doubt
but
you
need
it
in
that
trim
retorted
she
why
didn
t
you
put
on
pumps
and
silk
stockings
with
pink
clocks
he
was
glad
to
bow
himself
out
she
kept
on
so
but
he
thought
he
would
do
it
with
a
pleasant
remark
to
show
her
he
bore
no
just
look
at
the
crowds
pouring
down
miss
corny
the
church
will
be
as
full
as
it
can
i
dare
say
it
will
retorted
she
one
fool
makes
i
fear
miss
cornelia
does
not
like
this
marriage
any
more
than
she
did
the
last
quoth
dill
to
himself
as
he
stepped
into
his
fly
such
a
sensible
woman
as
she
is
in
other
things
to
be
so
bitter
against
archibald
because
he
marries
it
s
not
like
her
i
wonder
he
added
his
thoughts
changing
whether
i
do
look
foolish
in
this
shirt
i
m
sure
i
never
thought
of
decking
myself
out
to
appear
young
as
miss
corny
said
i
only
wished
to
testify
respect
to
archibald
and
miss
barbara
nothing
else
would
have
made
me
give
shillings
for
it
perhaps
it
s
not
etiquette
or
whatever
they
call
it
to
wear
them
in
the
morning
miss
corny
ought
to
know
and
there
certainly
must
be
something
wrong
about
it
by
the
way
it
put
her
up
well
it
can
t
be
helped
now
it
must
go
there
s
no
time
to
return
home
now
to
change
jude
s
church
was
in
a
cram
all
the
world
and
his
wife
had
flocked
into
it
those
who
could
not
get
in
took
up
their
station
in
the
churchyard
and
in
the
road
well
it
was
a
goodly
show
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
smart
as
fine
feathers
could
make
them
carlyle
was
one
of
the
first
to
enter
the
church
and
calm
the
very
sense
of
a
gentleman
oh
but
he
was
noble
to
look
upon
though
when
was
he
otherwise
and
clithero
were
there
anne
hare
that
was
a
surprise
for
some
of
the
gazers
who
had
not
known
they
were
expected
at
the
wedding
gentle
delicate
hare
walked
up
the
church
leaning
on
the
arm
of
sir
john
dobede
a
paler
shade
than
usual
on
her
sweet
sad
face
she
s
thinking
of
her
wretched
son
quoth
the
gossips
one
to
another
but
who
comes
in
now
with
an
air
as
if
the
whole
church
belonged
to
him
an
imposing
pompous
man
stern
and
grim
in
a
new
flaxen
wig
and
a
white
rose
in
his
buttonhole
it
is
justice
hare
and
he
leads
in
one
whom
folks
jump
upon
seats
to
get
a
look
at
very
lovely
was
barbara
in
her
soft
white
silk
robes
and
her
floating
veil
her
cheeks
now
blushing
rosy
red
now
pale
as
the
veil
that
shaded
them
betrayed
how
intense
was
her
emotion
the
bridesmaids
came
after
her
with
jaunty
steps
vain
in
their
important
office
louisa
dobede

kate
herbert

mary
pinner
carlyle
was
already
in
his
place
at
the
altar
and
as
barbara
neared
him
he
advanced
took
her
hand
and
placed
her
on
his
left
i
don
t
think
that
it
was
quite
usual
but
he
had
been
married
before
and
ought
to
know
the
clerk
directed
the
rest
where
to
stand
and
after
some
little
delay
the
service
proceeded
in
spite
of
her
emotion
and
that
it
was
great
scarcely
to
be
suppressed
none
could
doubt
barbara
made
the
responses
bravely
be
you
very
sure
that
a
woman
who
loves
him
she
is
being
united
to
must
experience
this
emotion
wilt
thou
have
this
man
to
be
thy
wedded
husband
to
live
together
after
god
s
ordinance
in
the
holy
estate
of
matrimony
spoke
the
rev
little
wilt
thou
obey
him
and
serve
him
love
honor
and
keep
him
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
forsaking
all
others
keep
thee
only
unto
him
so
long
as
ye
both
shall
live
i
clearly
firmly
impressively
was
the
answer
given
it
was
as
if
barbara
had
in
her
thoughts
one
who
had
not
kept
holy
unto
him
and
would
proclaim
her
own
resolution
never
so
to
betray
him
god
helping
her
the
ceremony
was
very
soon
over
and
barbara
the
magic
ring
upon
her
finger
and
her
arm
within
carlyle
s
was
led
out
to
his
chariot
now
hers
had
he
not
just
endowed
her
with
his
worldly
goods
the
crowd
shouted
and
hurrahed
as
they
caught
sight
of
her
blushing
face
but
the
carriage
was
soon
clear
of
the
crowd
who
concentrated
their
curiosity
upon
the
other
carriages
that
were
to
follow
it
the
company
were
speeding
back
to
the
grove
to
breakfast
carlyle
breaking
the
silence
suddenly
turned
to
his
bride
and
spoke
his
tone
impassioned
almost
unto
pain
barbara
you
will
keep
your
vows
to
me
she
raised
her
shy
blue
eyes
so
full
of
love
to
his
earnest
feeling
had
brought
the
tears
to
them
always
in
the
spirit
and
in
the
letter
until
death
shall
claim
me
so
help
me
heaven
the
german
were
crowded
that
early
autumn
they
generally
are
crowded
at
that
season
now
that
the
english
flock
abroad
in
shoals
like
the
swallows
quitting
our
cold
country
to
return
again
some
time
france
has
been
pretty
well
used
up
so
now
we
fall
upon
germany
stalkenberg
was
that
year
particularly
full
for
its
size
you
might
have
put
it
in
a
nutshell
and
it
derived
its
importance
name
and
most
else
belonging
to
it
from
its
lord
of
the
soil
the
baron
von
stalkenberg
a
stalwart
old
man
was
the
baron
with
grizzly
hair
a
grizzled
beard
and
manners
as
loutish
as
those
of
the
boars
he
hunted
he
had
four
sons
as
stalwart
as
himself
and
who
promised
to
be
in
time
as
grizzled
they
were
all
styled
the
counts
von
stalkenberg
being
distinguished
by
their
christian
names
all
save
the
eldest
son
and
he
was
generally
called
the
young
baron
two
of
them
were
away
soldiers
and
two
the
eldest
and
the
youngest
lived
with
their
father
in
the
castle
of
stalkenberg
situated
about
a
mile
from
the
village
to
which
it
gave
its
name
the
young
baron
von
stalkenberg
was
at
liberty
to
marry
the
three
counts
von
stalkenberg
were
not
unless
they
could
pick
up
a
wife
with
enough
money
to
keep
herself
and
her
husband
in
this
creed
they
had
been
brought
up
it
was
a
perfectly
understood
creed
and
not
rebelled
against
the
young
baron
von
stalkenberg
who
was
only
styled
young
in
contradistinction
to
his
father
being
in
his
year
was
famous
for
a
handsome
person
and
for
his
passionate
love
of
the
chase
of
wild
boars
and
wolves
he
was
the
deadly
enemy
the
count
otto
von
stalkenberg
eleven
years
his
brother
s
junior
was
famous
for
nothing
but
his
moustache
a
habit
of
eating
and
an
undue
addiction
to
draughts
of
marcobrunen
somewhat
meager
fare
so
report
ran
was
the
fashion
in
the
castle
of
stalkenberg
neither
the
old
baron
nor
his
heir
cared
for
luxury
therefore
count
von
otto
was
sure
to
be
seen
at
the
table
d
hote
as
often
as
anybody
would
invite
him
and
that
was
nearly
every
day
for
the
count
von
stalkenberg
was
a
title
and
his
baronial
father
proprietor
of
all
stalkenberg
lorded
it
in
the
baronial
castle
close
by
all
of
which
appeared
very
grand
and
great
and
that
the
english
bow
down
to
with
an
idol
s
worship
stopping
at
the
ludwig
bad
the
chief
hotel
in
the
place
was
a
family
of
the
name
of
crosby
it
consisted
of
and
crosby
an
only
daughter
her
governess
and
two
or
three
servants
what
crosby
had
done
to
england
or
england
to
him
i
can
t
say
but
he
never
went
near
his
native
country
for
years
and
years
he
had
lived
abroad
not
in
any
settled
place
of
residence
they
would
travel
about
and
remain
a
year
or
two
in
one
place
a
year
or
two
in
another
as
the
whim
suited
them
a
respectable
portly
man
of
quiet
and
gentlemanly
manners
looking
as
little
like
one
who
need
be
afraid
of
the
laws
of
his
own
land
as
can
be
neither
is
it
said
or
insinuated
that
he
was
afraid
of
them
a
gentleman
who
knew
him
had
told
many
years
before
in
answer
to
a
doubt
that
crosby
was
as
free
to
go
home
and
establish
himself
in
a
mansion
in
piccadilly
as
the
best
of
them
but
he
had
lost
fearfully
by
some
roguish
scheme
like
the
south
sea
bubble
and
could
not
live
in
the
style
he
once
had
done
therefore
preferred
remaining
abroad
crosby
was
a
pleasant
chatty
woman
given
to
take
as
much
gayety
as
she
could
get
and
helena
crosby
was
a
remarkably
fine
grown
girl
of
seventeen
you
might
have
given
her
some
years
on
it
had
you
been
guessing
her
age
for
she
was
no
child
either
in
appearance
or
manners
and
never
had
been
she
was
an
heiress
too
an
uncle
had
left
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
at
her
mother
s
death
she
would
have
ten
thousand
more
the
count
otto
von
stalkenberg
heard
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
turned
his
fierce
moustache
and
his
eyes
on
miss
helena
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
von
handsome
girls
cogitated
he
for
he
prided
himself
upon
his
english
it
is
just
what
i
have
been
seeking
he
found
the
rumor
touching
her
fortune
to
be
correct
and
from
that
time
was
seldom
apart
from
the
crosbys
they
were
as
pleased
to
have
his
society
as
he
was
to
be
in
theirs
for
was
he
not
the
count
von
stalkenberg
and
the
other
visitors
at
stalkenberg
looking
on
with
envy
would
have
given
their
ears
to
be
honored
with
a
like
intimacy
one
day
there
thundered
down
in
a
vehicle
the
old
baron
von
stalkenberg
the
old
chief
had
come
to
pay
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
crosbys
and
the
host
of
the
ludwig
bad
as
he
appeared
himself
to
marshal
this
chieftain
to
their
saloon
bowed
his
body
low
with
every
step
room
there
room
there
for
the
mighty
baron
von
the
mighty
baron
had
come
to
invite
them
to
a
feast
at
his
castle
where
no
feast
had
ever
been
made
so
grand
before
as
this
would
be
and
otto
had
carte
blanche
to
engage
other
distinguished
sojourners
at
stalkenberg
english
french
and
natives
who
had
been
civil
to
him
crosby
s
head
was
turned
and
now
i
ask
you
knowing
as
you
do
our
national
notions
was
it
not
enough
to
turn
it
you
will
not
then
be
surprised
to
hear
that
when
some
days
subsequent
to
the
feast
the
count
otto
von
stalkenberg
laid
his
proposals
at
helena
s
feet
they
were
not
rejected
helena
crosby
rushed
into
her
governess
s
room
madam
madam
only
think
i
am
going
to
be
married
madam
lifted
her
pale
sad
face
a
very
sad
and
pale
face
was
hers
indeed
she
gently
uttered
and
my
studies
are
to
be
over
from
mamma
says
you
are
over
young
to
marry
now
don
t
you
bring
up
that
madam
it
is
just
what
papa
is
harping
upon
returned
miss
helena
it
is
to
count
otto
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
governess
s
english
was
perfect
although
the
young
lady
addressed
her
as
count
otto
of
course
as
if
i
would
marry
anybody
else
look
at
the
governess
reader
and
see
whether
you
know
her
you
will
say
but
you
do
for
it
is
lady
isabel
vane
but
how
strangely
she
is
altered
yes
the
railway
accident
did
that
for
her
and
what
the
accident
left
undone
grief
and
remorse
accomplished
she
limps
as
she
walks
and
slightly
stoops
taken
from
her
former
height
a
scar
extends
from
her
chin
above
her
mouth
completely
changing
the
character
of
the
lower
part
of
her
face
some
of
her
teeth
are
missing
so
that
she
speaks
with
a
lisp
and
the
sober
bands
of
her
gray
hair
it
is
nearly
silver
are
confined
under
a
large
and
close
cap
she
herself
tries
to
make
the
change
greater
so
that
all
chance
of
being
recognized
may
be
at
an
end
and
for
that
reason
she
wears
disfiguring
spectacles
and
a
broad
band
of
gray
velvet
coming
down
low
upon
her
forehead
her
dress
too
is
equally
disfiguring
never
is
she
seen
in
one
that
fits
her
person
but
in
those
frightful
loose
jackets
which
must
surely
have
been
invented
by
somebody
envious
of
a
pretty
shape
as
to
her
bonnet
it
would
put
to
shame
those
masquerade
things
tilted
on
to
the
back
of
the
head
for
it
actually
shaded
her
face
and
she
was
never
seen
out
without
a
thick
veil
she
was
pretty
easy
upon
the
score
of
being
recognized
now
for
ducie
and
her
daughters
had
been
sojourning
at
stalkenberg
and
they
did
not
know
her
in
the
least
who
could
know
her
what
resemblance
was
there
between
that
gray
woman
with
her
disfiguring
marks
and
the
once
loved
lady
isabel
with
her
bright
color
her
beauty
her
dark
flowing
curls
and
her
agile
figure
carlyle
himself
could
not
have
told
her
but
she
was
still
in
spite
of
it
all
gentle
and
interesting
and
people
wondered
to
see
that
gray
hair
in
one
yet
young
she
had
been
with
the
crosbys
going
on
for
two
years
after
her
recovery
from
the
railway
accident
she
removed
to
a
quiet
town
in
the
vicinity
they
were
living
there
and
she
became
daily
governess
to
helena
the
crosbys
were
given
to
understand
that
she
was
english
but
the
widow
of
a
frenchman
she
was
obliged
to
offer
some
plausible
account
there
were
no
references
but
she
so
won
upon
their
esteem
as
the
daily
governess
that
they
soon
took
her
into
the
house
had
lady
isabel
surmised
that
they
would
be
travelling
to
so
conspicuous
a
spot
as
an
frequented
german
she
might
have
hesitated
to
accept
the
engagement
however
it
had
been
of
service
to
her
the
meeting
with
ducie
proving
that
she
was
altered
beyond
chance
of
recognition
she
could
go
anywhere
now
but
now
about
her
state
of
mind
i
don
t
know
how
to
describe
it
the
vain
yearning
the
inward
fever
the
restless
longing
for
what
might
not
be
longing
for
what
for
her
children
let
the
mother
be
she
a
duchess
or
be
she
an
at
a
stand
be
separated
for
awhile
from
her
little
children
let
her
answer
how
she
yearns
for
them
she
may
be
away
on
a
tour
of
pleasure
for
a
few
weeks
the
longing
to
see
their
little
faces
again
to
hear
their
prattling
tongues
to
feel
their
soft
kisses
is
kept
under
and
there
may
be
frequent
messages
the
children
s
dear
love
to
mamma
but
as
the
weeks
lengthen
out
the
desire
to
see
them
again
becomes
almost
irrepressible
what
must
it
have
been
then
for
lady
isabel
who
had
endured
this
longing
for
years
talk
of
the
mal
du
pays
which
is
said
to
attack
the
swiss
when
exiled
from
their
country
that
is
as
nothing
compared
to
the
heartsickness
which
clung
to
lady
isabel
she
had
passionately
loved
her
children
she
had
been
anxious
for
their
welfare
in
all
ways
and
not
the
least
she
had
to
endure
now
was
the
thought
that
she
had
abandoned
them
to
be
trained
by
strangers
would
they
be
trained
to
goodness
to
morality
to
religion
careless
as
she
herself
had
once
been
upon
these
points
she
had
learnt
better
now
would
isabel
grow
up
to
indifference
to
perhaps
do
as
she
had
done
lady
isabel
flung
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
groaned
in
anguish
it
happened
that
latimer
a
lady
living
at
west
lynne
betook
herself
about
that
time
to
stalkenberg
and
with
her
three
parts
maid
and
one
part
companion
went
afy
hallijohn
not
that
afy
was
admitted
to
the
society
of
latimer
to
sit
with
her
or
dine
with
her
nothing
of
that
but
she
did
enjoy
more
privileges
than
most
ladies
maids
do
and
afy
who
was
never
backward
at
setting
off
her
own
consequence
gave
out
that
she
was
latimer
was
an
easy
woman
fond
of
afy
and
afy
had
made
her
own
tale
good
to
her
respecting
the
natured
reports
at
the
time
of
the
murder
so
that
latimer
looked
upon
her
as
one
to
be
compassionated
latimer
and
crosby
whose
apartments
in
the
hotel
joined
struck
up
a
violent
friendship
the
one
for
the
other
ere
the
former
had
been
a
week
at
the
ludwig
they
had
sworn
something
like
eternal
sisterhood
as
both
had
probably
done
for
others
fifty
times
before
chapter
xxxii
meeting
of
lady
isabel
and
afy
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
helena
crosby
communicated
her
future
prospects
to
lady
isabel
the
latter
strolled
out
in
the
twilight
and
took
her
seat
on
a
bench
in
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
gardens
where
she
was
fond
of
sitting
now
it
occurred
that
afy
some
minutes
afterwards
found
herself
in
the
same
walk
and
a
very
dull
one
too
she
was
thinking
who
s
that
quoth
afy
to
herself
her
eyes
falling
upon
lady
isabel
oh
it
s
that
governess
of
the
crosby
s
she
may
be
known
a
half
a
mile
off
by
her
grandmother
s
bonnet
i
ll
go
and
have
a
chat
with
accordingly
afy
who
was
never
troubled
with
bashfulness
went
up
and
seated
herself
beside
lady
isabel
good
evening
madame
vine
cried
she
good
evening
replied
lady
isabel
courteously
not
having
the
least
idea
who
afy
might
be
you
don
t
know
me
i
fancy
pursued
afy
so
gathering
from
lady
isabel
s
looks
i
am
companion
to
latimer
and
she
is
spending
the
evening
with
crosby
precious
dull
this
do
you
think
so
it
is
for
me
i
can
t
speak
german
or
french
and
the
upper
attendants
of
families
here
can
t
most
of
them
speak
english
i
m
sure
i
go
about
like
an
owl
able
to
do
nothing
but
stare
i
was
sick
enough
to
come
here
but
i
d
rather
be
back
at
west
lynne
quiet
as
it
lady
isabel
had
not
been
encouraging
her
companion
either
by
words
or
manner
but
the
last
sentence
caused
her
heart
to
bound
within
her
control
herself
as
she
would
she
could
not
quite
hide
her
feverish
interest
do
you
come
from
west
lynne
yes
horrid
place
latimer
took
a
house
there
soon
after
i
went
to
live
with
her
i
d
rather
she
d
taken
it
at
botany
why
do
you
not
like
it
because
i
don
t
was
afy
s
satisfactory
answer
do
you
know
east
lynne
resumed
lady
isabel
her
heart
beating
and
her
brain
whirling
as
she
deliberated
how
she
could
put
all
the
questions
she
wished
to
ask
i
ought
to
know
it
returned
afy
my
own
sister
miss
hallijohn
is
head
maid
there
why
do
you
know
it
madame
vine
lady
isabel
hesitated
she
was
deliberating
upon
her
answer
some
years
ago
i
was
staying
in
the
neighborhood
for
a
little
time
she
said
i
should
like
to
hear
of
the
carlyles
again
they
were
a
nice
afy
tossed
her
head
ah
but
there
have
been
changes
since
that
i
dare
say
you
knew
them
in
the
time
of
lady
isabel
another
pause
lady
isabel
yes
she
was
carlyle
s
and
a
nice
wife
she
made
him
ironically
rejoined
afy
you
must
have
heard
of
it
madame
vine
unless
you
lived
in
the
wood
she
eloped
abandoned
him
and
her
are
the
children
living
yes
poor
things
but
the
one
s
on
the
road
to
the
churchyard
if
ever
i
saw
threatened
consumption
yet
joyce
that
s
my
sister
is
in
a
flaring
temper
when
i
say
it
she
thinks
it
will
get
strong
lady
isabel
passed
her
handkerchief
across
her
moist
brow
which
of
the
children
is
it
she
faintly
asked
isabel
isabel
retorted
afy
who
s
isabel
the
eldest
child
i
mean
miss
isabel
there
s
no
isabel
there
s
lucy
she
s
the
only
when
when
i
knew
them
there
was
only
one
daughter
the
other
two
were
boys
i
remember
quite
well
that
she
was
called
stay
said
afy
now
you
speak
of
it
what
was
it
that
i
heard
it
was
wilson
told
me
i
recollect
she
s
the
nurse
why
the
very
night
that
his
wife
went
away
carlyle
gave
orders
that
the
child
in
future
should
be
called
lucy
her
second
name
no
wonder
added
afy
violently
indignant
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
sound
of
her
mother
s
or
suffer
the
child
to
bear
no
wonder
murmured
lady
isabel
which
child
is
it
that
s
ill
it
s
william
the
eldest
boy
he
is
not
to
say
ill
but
he
is
as
thin
as
a
herring
with
an
unnaturally
bright
look
on
his
cheek
and
a
glaze
upon
his
eye
joyce
says
that
his
cheeks
are
no
brighter
than
his
mother
s
were
but
i
know
better
folks
in
health
don
t
have
those
brilliant
did
you
ever
see
lady
isabel
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
not
i
returned
afy
i
should
have
thought
it
demeaning
one
does
not
care
to
be
brought
into
contact
with
that
sort
of
misdoing
lot
you
know
madame
there
as
another
one
a
little
boy
archibald
i
think
his
name
was
is
he
well
oh
the
troublesome
youngster
he
is
as
sturdy
as
a
turk
no
fear
of
his
going
into
consumption
he
is
the
very
image
of
carlyle
is
that
child
i
say
though
madame
continued
afy
changing
the
subject
unceremoniously
if
you
were
stopping
at
west
lynne
perhaps
you
heard
some
wicked
stories
concerning
me
i
believe
i
did
hear
your
name
mentioned
i
can
not
charge
my
memory
now
with
the
my
father
was
murdered
you
must
have
heard
of
that
yes
i
recollect
so
he
was
murdered
by
a
chap
called
richard
hare
who
decamped
instanter
perhaps
you
know
the
hares
also
well
directly
after
the
funeral
i
left
west
lynne
i
could
not
bear
the
place
and
i
stopped
away
and
what
do
you
suppose
they
said
of
me
that
i
had
gone
after
richard
hare
not
that
i
knew
they
were
saying
it
or
i
should
pretty
soon
have
been
back
and
given
them
the
length
of
my
tongue
but
now
i
just
ask
you
as
a
lady
madame
vine
whether
a
more
infamous
accusation
was
ever
pitched
upon
and
you
had
not
gone
after
him
no
that
i
swear
passionately
returned
afy
make
myself
a
companion
of
my
father
s
murderer
if
calcraft
the
hangman
finished
off
a
few
of
those
west
lynne
scandalmongers
it
might
be
a
warning
to
the
others
i
said
so
to
to
carlyle
repeated
lady
isabel
hardly
conscious
that
she
did
repeat
it
he
laughed
i
remember
and
said
that
would
not
stop
the
scandal
the
only
one
who
did
not
misjudge
me
was
himself
he
did
not
believe
that
i
was
with
richard
hare
but
he
was
ever
was
i
suppose
you
were
in
a
situation
afy
coughed
to
be
sure
more
than
one
i
lived
as
companion
with
an
old
lady
who
so
valued
me
that
she
left
me
a
handsome
legacy
in
her
will
i
lived
two
years
with
the
countess
of
mount
with
the
countess
of
mount
severn
echoed
lady
isabel
surprised
into
the
remark
why
she
she
was
related
to
carlyle
s
wife
at
least
lord
mount
severn
of
course
everybody
knows
that
i
was
living
there
at
the
time
the
business
happened
didn
t
the
countess
pull
lady
isabel
to
pieces
she
and
miss
levison
used
to
sit
cant
cant
all
day
over
it
oh
i
assure
you
i
know
all
about
it
just
as
much
as
joyce
did
have
you
got
that
headache
that
you
are
leaning
on
your
hand
headache
and
heartache
both
she
might
have
answered
miss
afy
resumed
so
after
the
flattering
compliment
west
lynne
had
paid
to
me
you
may
judge
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
back
to
it
madame
vine
and
if
i
had
not
found
that
latimer
s
promised
to
be
an
excellent
place
i
should
have
left
it
rather
than
be
marshaled
there
but
i
have
lived
it
down
i
should
like
to
hear
any
of
them
fibbing
against
me
now
do
you
know
that
blessed
miss
corny
i
have
seen
she
shakes
her
head
and
makes
eyes
at
me
still
but
so
she
would
at
an
angel
a
old
cockatoo
is
she
still
at
east
lynne
not
she
indeed
there
would
be
drawn
battles
between
her
and
carlyle
if
she
a
dart
as
of
an
seemed
to
arrest
the
blood
in
lady
isabel
s
veins
mrs
carlyle
she
faltered
who
is
carlyle
mr
carlyle
s
wife
who
should
she
be
the
rushing
blood
leaped
on
now
fast
and
fiery
i
did
not
know
he
had
married
he
has
been
married
now
oh
getting
on
for
fifteen
months
a
twelvemonth
last
june
i
went
to
the
church
to
see
them
married
wasn
t
there
a
cram
she
looked
beautiful
that
lady
isabel
laid
her
hand
upon
her
breast
but
for
that
delectable
loose
jacket
afy
might
have
detected
her
bosom
rise
and
fall
she
steadied
her
voice
sufficiently
to
speak
did
he
marry
barbara
hare
you
may
take
your
oath
of
that
said
afy
if
folks
tell
true
there
was
love
scenes
between
them
before
he
ever
thought
of
lady
isabel
i
had
that
from
wilson
and
she
ought
to
know
for
she
lived
at
the
hares
another
thing
is
said
only
you
must
just
believe
one
word
of
west
lynne
talk
and
disbelieve
ten
that
if
lady
isabel
had
not
died
carlyle
never
would
have
married
again
he
had
scruples
half
a
dozen
were
given
him
by
report
louisa
dobede
for
one
and
mary
pinner
for
another
such
nonsense
folks
might
have
made
sure
it
would
be
barbara
hare
there
s
a
baby
is
there
was
the
faint
answer
a
beautiful
boy
three
or
four
months
old
carlyle
is
not
a
little
proud
of
him
she
worships
her
is
she
kind
to
the
first
children
for
all
i
know
i
don
t
think
she
has
much
to
do
with
them
archibald
is
in
the
nursery
and
the
other
two
are
mostly
with
the
i
wonder
cried
the
governess
how
the
tidings
of
lady
isabel
s
death
were
received
at
east
lynne
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
they
held
it
as
a
jubilee
i
should
say
and
set
all
the
bells
in
town
to
ring
and
feasted
the
men
upon
legs
of
mutton
and
onion
sauce
afterward
i
should
i
know
a
brute
animal
deaf
and
dumb
such
as
a
cow
or
a
goose
clings
to
its
offspring
but
she
abandoned
hers
are
you
going
in
madame
vine
i
must
go
in
now
good
evening
to
she
had
sat
till
she
could
sit
no
longer
her
very
heartstrings
were
wrung
and
she
might
not
rise
up
in
defence
of
herself
defence
did
she
not
deserve
more
ten
thousand
times
more
reproach
than
had
met
her
ears
now
this
girl
did
not
say
of
her
half
what
the
world
must
say
there
is
a
governess
nearly
the
first
thing
that
carlyle
did
after
his
wife
s
moonlight
flitting
was
to
seek
a
governess
and
she
has
been
there
ever
since
she
is
going
to
leave
now
to
be
married
joyce
told
are
you
much
at
east
lynne
afy
shook
her
head
i
am
not
going
much
i
can
tell
you
where
i
am
looked
down
upon
carlyle
does
not
favor
me
she
knew
that
her
brother
richard
would
have
given
his
hand
to
marry
me
and
she
resents
it
not
such
a
great
catch
i
m
sure
that
dick
hare
even
if
he
had
gone
on
right
continued
afy
somewhat
after
the
example
of
the
fox
looking
at
the
unattainable
grapes
he
had
no
brains
to
speak
of
and
what
he
had
were
the
color
of
a
peacock
s
tail
to
bed
at
the
usual
time
but
not
to
sleep
what
she
had
heard
only
increased
her
vain
insensate
longing
a
stepmother
at
east
lynne
and
one
of
her
children
gliding
on
to
death
oh
to
be
with
them
to
see
them
once
again
to
purchase
that
boon
she
would
willingly
forfeit
all
the
rest
of
her
existence
her
frame
was
fevered
the
bed
was
fevered
and
she
arose
and
paced
the
room
this
state
of
mind
would
inevitably
bring
on
bodily
illness
possibly
an
attack
of
the
brain
she
dreaded
that
for
there
was
no
telling
what
she
might
reveal
in
her
delirium
her
temples
were
throbbing
her
heart
was
beating
and
she
once
more
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
pressed
the
pillow
down
upon
her
forehead
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
news
of
carlyle
s
marriage
helped
greatly
the
excitement
she
did
not
pray
to
die
but
she
did
wish
that
death
might
come
to
her
what
would
have
been
the
ending
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
a
strange
turn
in
affairs
came
one
of
those
wonderful
coincidences
sometimes
but
not
often
to
be
met
with
crosby
appeared
in
madame
vine
s
room
after
breakfast
and
gave
her
an
account
of
helena
s
projected
marriage
she
then
apologized
the
real
object
of
her
visit
for
dispensing
so
summarily
with
madame
s
services
but
had
reason
to
hope
that
she
could
introduce
her
to
another
situation
would
madame
have
any
objection
to
take
one
in
england
madame
was
upon
the
point
of
replying
that
she
should
not
choose
to
enter
one
in
england
when
crosby
stopped
her
saying
that
she
would
call
in
latimer
who
could
tell
her
about
it
better
than
she
could
latimer
came
in
all
eagerness
and
volubility
ah
my
dear
madame
she
exclaimed
you
would
be
fortunate
indeed
if
you
were
to
get
into
this
family
the
nicest
people
they
are
he
so
liked
and
respected
she
so
pretty
and
engaging
a
most
desirable
situation
too
treated
as
a
lady
and
all
things
comfortable
there
s
only
one
pupil
a
girl
one
of
the
little
boys
i
believe
goes
in
for
an
hour
or
two
but
that
s
not
much
and
the
salary
s
seventy
guineas
they
are
friends
of
mine
the
carlyles
such
a
beautiful
place
they
live
at
east
the
carlyles
east
lynne
go
governess
there
lady
isabel
s
breath
was
taken
away
they
are
parting
with
their
governess
continued
latimer
and
when
i
was
there
a
day
or
two
before
i
started
on
my
tour
to
germany
carlyle
said
to
me
i
suppose
you
could
not
pick
us
up
a
desirable
governess
for
lucy
one
who
is
mistress
of
french
and
she
spoke
in
a
half
joking
tone
but
i
feel
sure
that
were
i
to
write
word
i
had
found
one
desirable
it
would
give
her
pleasure
now
crosby
tells
me
your
french
is
quite
that
of
a
native
madame
vine
that
you
read
and
speak
german
well
and
that
your
musical
abilities
are
excellent
i
think
you
would
be
just
the
one
to
suit
and
i
have
no
doubt
i
could
get
you
the
situation
what
do
you
say
what
could
she
say
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
i
am
anxious
to
find
you
one
if
i
can
put
in
crosby
we
have
been
much
pleased
with
you
and
i
should
like
you
to
be
desirably
placed
as
latimer
is
so
kind
as
to
interest
herself
it
appears
to
me
an
opportunity
that
should
not
be
shall
i
write
to
carlyle
rejoined
latimer
lady
isabel
roused
herself
and
so
far
cleared
her
intellect
as
to
understand
and
answer
the
question
perhaps
you
would
kindly
give
me
until
morning
to
consider
on
it
i
had
not
intended
to
take
a
situation
in
a
battle
she
had
with
herself
that
day
at
one
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
providence
must
have
placed
this
opportunity
in
her
way
that
she
might
see
her
children
in
her
desperate
longing
at
another
a
voice
appeared
to
whisper
that
it
was
a
wily
dangerous
temptation
flung
across
her
path
one
which
it
was
her
duty
to
resist
and
flee
from
then
came
another
phase
of
the
picture
how
should
she
bear
to
see
carlyle
the
husband
of
another
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
them
to
witness
his
attentions
possibly
his
caresses
it
might
be
difficult
but
she
could
force
and
school
her
heart
to
endurance
had
she
not
resolved
in
her
first
bitter
repentance
to
take
up
her
cross
daily
and
bear
it
no
her
own
feelings
let
them
be
wrung
as
they
would
should
not
prove
the
obstacle
evening
came
and
she
had
not
decided
she
passed
another
night
of
pain
of
restlessness
of
longing
for
her
children
this
intense
longing
appeared
to
be
overmastering
all
her
powers
of
mind
and
body
the
temptation
at
length
proved
too
strong
the
project
having
been
placed
before
her
covetous
eyes
could
not
be
relinquished
and
she
finally
consented
to
go
what
is
it
that
would
keep
me
away
she
argued
the
dread
of
discovery
well
if
that
comes
it
must
they
could
not
hang
me
or
kill
me
deeper
humiliation
than
ever
would
be
my
portion
when
they
drive
me
from
east
lynne
with
abhorrence
and
ignominy
as
a
soldier
is
drummed
out
of
his
regiment
but
i
could
bear
that
as
i
must
bear
the
rest
and
i
can
shrink
under
the
hedge
and
lay
myself
down
to
die
humiliation
for
me
no
i
will
not
put
that
in
comparison
with
seeing
and
being
with
my
latimer
wrote
to
carlyle
she
had
met
with
a
governess
one
desirable
in
every
way
who
could
not
fail
to
suit
her
views
precisely
she
was
a
madame
vine
english
by
birth
but
the
widow
of
a
frenchman
a
protestant
a
thorough
gentlewoman
an
efficient
linguist
and
musician
and
competent
to
her
duties
in
all
ways
crosby
with
whom
she
had
lived
two
years
regarded
her
as
a
treasure
and
would
not
have
parted
with
her
but
for
helena
s
marriage
with
a
german
nobleman
you
must
not
mind
her
appearance
went
on
the
letter
she
is
the
person
wears
spectacles
caps
enormous
bonnets
and
has
a
great
scar
on
her
mouth
and
chin
and
though
she
can
t
be
more
than
thirty
her
hair
is
gray
she
is
also
slightly
lame
but
understand
you
she
is
a
lady
with
it
all
and
looks
when
this
description
reached
east
lynne
barbara
laughed
at
it
as
she
read
it
aloud
to
carlyle
he
laughed
also
it
is
well
governesses
are
not
chosen
according
to
their
looks
he
said
or
i
fear
madame
vine
would
stand
but
a
poor
they
resolved
to
engage
her
and
word
went
back
to
that
effect
a
strangely
wild
tumult
filled
lady
isabel
s
bosom
she
first
of
all
hunted
her
luggage
over
her
desk
everything
belonging
to
her
lest
any
mark
on
the
linen
might
be
there
which
could
give
a
clue
to
her
former
self
the
bulk
of
her
luggage
remained
in
paris
warehoused
where
it
had
been
sent
ere
she
quitted
grenoble
she
next
saw
to
her
wardrobe
making
it
still
more
unlike
anything
she
had
used
to
wear
her
caps
save
that
they
were
simple
and
fitted
closely
to
the
face
nearly
rivaled
those
of
miss
carlyle
her
handwriting
she
had
been
striving
for
years
to
change
the
character
of
and
had
so
far
succeeded
that
none
would
now
take
it
for
lady
isabel
vane
s
but
her
hand
shook
as
she
wrote
to
carlyle
who
had
written
to
her
she
she
writing
to
carlyle
s
wife
and
in
the
capacity
of
a
subordinate
how
would
she
like
to
live
with
her
as
a
subordinate
as
servant
it
may
be
said
where
she
had
once
reigned
the
idolized
lady
she
must
bear
that
as
she
must
bear
all
else
hot
tears
came
into
her
eyes
with
a
gush
as
they
fell
on
the
signature
barbara
all
ready
she
sat
down
and
waited
the
signal
of
departure
but
that
was
not
to
be
yet
it
was
finally
arranged
that
she
should
travel
to
england
and
to
west
lynne
with
latimer
and
that
lady
would
not
return
until
october
lady
isabel
could
only
fold
her
hands
and
strive
for
patience
but
the
day
did
come
it
actually
did
and
latimer
lady
isabel
and
afy
quitted
stalkenberg
latimer
would
only
travel
slowly
and
the
impatient
fevered
woman
thought
the
journey
would
never
end
you
have
been
informed
i
think
of
the
position
of
these
unhappy
children
that
you
are
going
to
latimer
observed
to
her
one
day
you
must
not
speak
to
them
of
their
mother
she
left
it
is
never
well
to
speak
to
children
of
a
mother
who
has
disgraced
them
carlyle
would
not
like
it
and
i
dare
say
they
are
taught
to
forget
her
and
to
regard
carlyle
as
their
only
her
aching
heart
had
to
assent
to
all
it
was
a
foggy
afternoon
gray
with
the
coming
twilight
when
they
arrived
at
west
lynne
latimer
believing
the
governess
was
a
novice
in
england
kindly
put
her
into
a
fly
and
told
the
driver
his
destination
au
revoir
madame
she
said
and
good
luck
to
once
more
she
was
whirling
along
the
familiar
road
she
saw
justice
hare
s
house
she
saw
other
marks
which
she
knew
well
and
once
more
she
saw
east
lynne
the
dear
old
house
for
the
fly
had
turned
into
the
avenue
lights
were
moving
in
the
windows
it
looked
gay
and
cheerful
a
contrast
to
her
her
heart
was
sick
with
expectation
her
throat
was
beating
and
as
the
man
thundered
up
with
all
the
force
of
his
one
horse
and
halted
at
the
steps
her
sight
momentarily
left
her
would
carlyle
come
to
the
fly
to
hand
her
out
she
wished
she
had
never
undertaken
the
project
now
in
the
depth
of
her
fear
and
agitation
the
hall
door
was
flung
open
and
there
gushed
forth
a
blaze
of
light
two
stood
there
the
one
remained
in
the
hall
the
other
advanced
to
the
chaise
he
assisted
lady
isabel
to
alight
and
then
busied
himself
with
the
luggage
as
she
ascended
to
the
hall
she
recognized
old
peter
strange
indeed
did
it
seem
not
to
say
how
are
you
peter
but
to
meet
him
as
a
stranger
for
a
moment
she
was
at
a
loss
for
words
what
should
she
say
or
ask
coming
to
her
own
home
her
manner
was
embarrassed
her
voice
low
is
carlyle
within
yes
ma
at
that
moment
joyce
came
forward
to
receive
her
it
is
madame
vine
i
believe
she
respectfully
said
please
to
step
this
way
but
lady
isabel
lingered
in
the
hall
ostensibly
to
see
that
her
boxes
came
in
right
stephen
was
bringing
them
up
in
reality
to
gather
a
short
respite
for
joyce
might
be
about
to
usher
her
into
the
presence
of
and
carlyle
joyce
however
did
nothing
of
the
sort
she
merely
conducted
her
to
the
gray
parlor
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
grate
looking
cheerful
on
the
autumn
night
this
is
your
madame
what
will
you
please
to
take
i
will
order
it
brought
in
while
i
show
you
your
a
cup
of
tea
answered
lady
isabel
tea
and
some
cold
meat
suggested
joyce
but
lady
isabel
interrupted
her
nothing
but
tea
and
a
little
cold
joyce
rang
the
bell
ordered
the
refreshment
to
be
made
ready
and
then
preceded
lady
isabel
upstairs
on
she
followed
her
heart
palpitating
past
the
rooms
that
used
to
be
hers
along
the
corridor
toward
the
second
staircase
the
door
of
her
old
stood
open
and
she
glanced
in
with
a
yearning
look
no
never
more
never
more
could
it
be
hers
she
had
put
it
from
her
by
her
own
free
act
and
deed
not
less
comfortable
did
it
look
now
than
in
former
days
but
it
had
passed
into
another
s
occupancy
the
fire
threw
its
blaze
on
the
furniture
there
were
the
little
ornaments
on
the
large
as
they
used
to
be
in
her
time
and
the
cut
glass
of
crystal
was
glittering
in
the
firelight
on
the
sofa
lay
a
shawl
and
a
book
and
on
the
bed
a
silk
dress
as
thrown
there
after
being
taken
off
no
those
rooms
were
not
for
her
now
and
she
followed
joyce
up
the
other
staircase
the
bedroom
she
was
shown
to
was
commodious
and
well
furnished
it
was
the
one
miss
carlyle
had
occupied
when
she
isabella
had
been
taken
a
bride
to
east
lynne
though
that
lady
had
subsequently
quitted
it
for
one
on
the
lower
floor
joyce
put
down
the
waxlight
she
carried
and
looked
round
would
you
like
a
fire
lighted
here
madame
for
perhaps
it
will
feel
welcome
after
oh
no
thank
you
was
the
answer
stephen
with
somebody
to
help
him
was
bringing
up
the
luggage
joyce
directed
him
where
to
place
it
telling
him
to
uncord
the
boxes
that
done
the
man
left
the
room
and
joyce
turned
to
lady
isabel
who
had
stood
like
a
statue
never
so
much
as
attempting
to
remove
her
bonnet
can
i
do
anything
for
you
madame
she
asked
lady
isabel
declined
in
the
first
moments
of
her
arrival
she
was
dreading
detection
how
was
it
possible
that
she
should
not
and
she
feared
joyce
s
keen
eyes
more
perhaps
than
she
feared
any
others
she
was
only
wishing
that
the
girl
would
go
down
should
you
want
anything
please
to
ring
and
hannah
will
come
up
said
joyce
preparing
to
retire
she
is
the
maid
who
waits
upon
the
gray
parlor
and
will
do
anything
you
like
up
joyce
had
quitted
the
room
and
lady
isabel
had
got
her
bonnet
off
when
the
door
opened
again
she
hastily
thrust
it
on
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
richard
hare
s
rushing
on
his
hat
and
false
whiskers
it
was
joyce
do
you
think
you
shall
find
your
way
down
alone
madame
yes
i
can
do
that
she
answered
find
her
way
in
that
house
lady
isabel
slowly
took
her
things
off
what
was
the
use
of
lingering
she
must
meet
their
eyes
sooner
or
later
though
in
truth
there
was
little
if
any
fear
of
her
detection
so
effectually
was
she
disguised
by
nature
s
altering
hand
or
by
art
s
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
she
kept
tranquil
had
the
tears
once
burst
forth
they
would
have
gone
on
to
hysterics
without
the
possibility
of
control
the
coming
home
again
to
east
lynne
oh
it
was
indeed
a
time
of
agitation
terrible
painful
agitation
and
none
can
wonder
at
it
shall
i
tell
you
what
she
did
yes
i
will
at
the
expense
of
ridicule
she
knelt
down
by
the
bed
and
prayed
for
courage
to
go
through
the
task
she
had
undertaken
prayed
for
even
she
the
sinful
who
had
quitted
that
house
under
circumstances
notorious
but
i
am
not
sure
that
this
mode
of
return
to
it
was
an
expedition
precisely
calculated
to
call
down
a
blessing
there
was
no
excuse
for
lingering
longer
and
she
descended
the
waxlight
in
her
hand
everything
was
ready
in
the
gray
parlor
the
tray
on
the
table
the
small
urn
hissing
away
the
in
proximity
to
it
a
silver
rack
of
dry
toast
butter
and
a
hot
muffin
covered
with
a
small
silver
cover
the
things
were
to
her
sight
as
old
faces
the
rack
the
small
cover
the
the
she
remembered
them
all
not
the
urn
a
copper
one
she
had
no
recollection
of
that
it
had
possibly
been
bought
for
the
use
of
the
governess
when
a
governess
came
into
use
at
east
lynne
could
she
have
given
herself
leisure
to
reflect
on
the
matter
she
might
have
told
by
the
signs
observable
in
the
short
period
she
had
been
in
the
house
that
governesses
of
east
lynne
were
regarded
as
gentlewomen
treated
well
and
liberally
yes
for
east
lynne
owned
carlyle
for
its
master
she
made
the
tea
and
sat
down
with
what
appetite
she
might
her
brain
her
thoughts
all
in
a
chaos
together
she
wondered
whether
and
carlyle
were
at
dinner
she
wondered
in
what
part
of
the
house
were
the
children
she
heard
bells
ring
now
and
then
she
heard
servants
cross
and
recross
the
hall
her
meal
over
she
rang
her
own
a
maid
answered
it
hannah
who
as
joyce
had
informed
her
waited
upon
the
gray
parlor
and
was
at
her
the
governess
s
especial
command
she
took
away
the
things
and
then
lady
isabel
sat
on
alone
for
how
long
she
scarcely
knew
when
a
sound
caused
her
heart
to
beat
as
if
it
would
burst
its
bounds
and
she
started
from
her
chair
like
one
who
has
received
an
electric
shock
it
was
nothing
to
be
startled
at
either
for
ordinary
people
for
it
was
but
the
sound
of
children
s
voices
her
children
were
they
being
brought
in
to
her
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heaving
bosom
no
they
were
but
traversing
the
hall
and
the
voices
faded
away
up
the
wide
staircase
perhaps
they
had
been
in
to
desert
as
in
the
old
times
and
were
now
going
up
to
bed
she
looked
at
her
new
watch
half
past
seven
her
new
watch
the
old
one
had
been
changed
away
for
it
all
her
trinkets
had
been
likewise
parted
with
sold
or
exchanged
away
lest
they
should
be
recognized
at
east
lynne
nothing
whatever
had
she
kept
except
her
mother
s
miniature
and
a
small
golden
cross
set
with
its
seven
emeralds
have
you
forgotten
that
cross
francis
levison
accidentally
broke
it
for
her
the
first
time
they
ever
met
if
she
had
looked
upon
the
breaking
of
that
cross
which
her
mother
had
enjoined
her
to
set
such
store
by
as
an
evil
omen
at
the
time
of
the
accident
how
awfully
had
the
subsequent
events
seemed
to
bear
her
fancy
out
these
two
articles
the
miniature
and
the
cross
she
could
not
bring
her
mind
to
part
with
she
had
sealed
them
up
and
placed
them
in
the
remotest
spot
of
her
away
from
all
chance
of
public
view
peter
entered
my
mistress
says
ma
am
she
would
be
glad
to
see
you
if
you
are
not
too
tired
will
you
please
to
walk
into
the
a
mist
swam
before
her
eyes
was
she
about
to
enter
the
presence
of
carlyle
had
the
moment
really
come
she
moved
to
the
door
which
peter
held
open
she
turned
her
head
from
the
man
for
she
could
feel
how
ashy
white
were
her
face
and
lips
is
carlyle
alone
she
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
the
most
indirect
way
she
could
put
the
question
as
to
whether
carlyle
was
there
quite
alone
ma
am
my
master
is
dining
out
madame
vine
i
think
he
added
waiting
to
announce
her
as
the
hall
traversed
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
door
madame
vine
she
said
correcting
him
for
peter
had
spoken
the
name
vine
broadly
according
to
our
english
habitude
she
set
him
right
and
pronounced
it
a
la
mode
francaise
madame
vine
ma
am
quoth
peter
to
his
mistress
as
he
ushered
in
lady
isabel
the
old
familiar
its
large
handsome
proportions
the
well
arranged
furniture
its
bright
chandelier
it
all
came
back
to
her
with
a
no
longer
her
that
she
should
take
pride
in
it
she
had
flung
it
away
from
her
when
she
flung
away
the
rest
seated
under
the
blaze
of
the
chandelier
was
barbara
not
a
day
older
did
she
look
than
when
lady
isabel
had
first
seen
her
at
the
churchyard
gates
when
she
had
inquired
of
her
husband
who
was
that
pretty
girl
barbara
hare
he
answered
ay
she
was
barbara
hare
then
but
now
she
was
barbara
carlyle
and
she
she
who
had
been
isabel
carlyle
was
isabel
vane
again
oh
woe
woe
inexpressibly
more
beautiful
looked
barbara
than
lady
isabel
had
ever
seen
her
or
else
she
fancied
it
her
evening
dress
was
of
pale
blue
no
other
color
suited
barbara
so
well
and
there
was
no
other
she
was
so
fond
of
and
on
her
fair
neck
there
was
a
gold
chain
and
on
her
arms
were
gold
bracelets
her
pretty
features
were
attractive
as
ever
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
and
her
light
hair
was
rich
and
abundant
a
contrast
her
hair
to
that
of
the
worn
woman
opposite
to
her
barbara
came
forward
her
hand
stretched
out
with
a
kindly
greeting
i
hope
you
are
not
very
much
tired
after
your
journey
lady
isabel
murmured
something
she
did
not
know
what
and
pushed
the
chair
set
for
her
as
much
as
possible
into
the
shade
you
are
not
ill
are
you
uttered
barbara
noting
the
intensely
pale
face
as
much
as
could
be
seen
of
it
for
the
cap
and
the
spectacles
not
ill
was
the
low
answer
only
a
little
would
you
prefer
that
i
spoke
with
you
in
the
morning
you
would
like
possibly
to
retire
to
bed
at
but
lady
isabel
declined
better
get
the
interview
over
by
candlelight
than
by
daylight
you
look
so
very
pale
i
feared
you
might
be
i
am
generally
pale
sometimes
remarkably
so
but
my
health
is
mrs
latimer
wrote
us
word
that
you
would
be
quite
sure
to
suit
us
freely
spoke
barbara
i
hope
you
will
and
that
you
may
find
your
residence
here
agreeable
have
you
lived
much
in
england
in
the
early
portion
of
my
and
you
have
lost
your
husband
and
your
children
stay
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
am
making
a
mistake
i
think
latimer
did
mention
i
have
lost
them
was
the
faint
quiet
response
oh
but
it
must
be
terrible
grief
when
children
die
exclaimed
barbara
clasping
her
hands
in
emotion
i
would
not
lose
my
babe
for
the
world
i
could
not
part
with
terrible
grief
and
hard
to
bear
outwardly
assented
lady
isabel
but
in
her
heart
she
was
thinking
that
death
was
not
the
worst
kind
of
parting
there
was
another
far
more
dreadful
carlyle
began
to
speak
of
the
children
she
was
to
take
charge
of
you
are
no
doubt
aware
that
they
are
not
mine
latimer
would
tell
you
they
are
the
children
of
carlyle
s
first
and
carlyle
s
interrupted
lady
isabel
what
in
the
world
made
her
put
in
that
she
wondered
herself
the
moment
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
a
scarlet
streak
flushed
her
cheeks
and
she
remembered
that
there
must
be
no
speaking
upon
impulse
at
east
lynne
mr
carlyle
s
of
course
said
barbara
believing
madame
vine
had
asked
the
question
their
position
the
girl
s
in
particular
is
a
sad
one
for
their
mother
left
them
oh
it
was
a
shocking
business
she
is
dead
i
hear
said
lady
isabel
hoping
to
turn
the
immediate
point
of
conversation
carlyle
however
continued
as
though
she
had
not
heard
her
mr
carlyle
married
lady
isabel
vane
the
late
lord
mount
severn
s
daughter
she
was
attractive
and
beautiful
but
i
do
not
fancy
she
cared
very
much
for
her
husband
however
that
may
have
been
she
ran
away
from
it
was
very
sad
observed
lady
isabel
feeling
that
she
was
expected
to
say
something
besides
she
had
her
role
to
play
sad
it
was
wicked
it
was
infamous
returned
carlyle
giving
way
to
some
excitement
of
all
men
living
of
all
husbands
carlyle
least
deserved
such
a
requital
you
will
say
so
when
you
come
to
know
and
the
affair
altogether
was
a
mystery
for
it
never
was
observed
or
suspected
by
any
one
that
lady
isabel
entertained
a
liking
for
another
it
was
francis
levison
she
eloped
with
sir
francis
he
is
now
he
had
been
staying
at
east
lynne
but
no
one
detected
any
undue
intimacy
between
them
not
even
carlyle
to
him
as
others
her
conduct
must
always
remain
a
madame
appeared
to
be
occupied
with
her
spectacles
setting
them
straight
barbara
continued
of
course
the
disgrace
is
reflected
on
the
children
and
always
will
be
the
shame
of
having
a
divorced
mother
is
she
not
dead
interrupted
lady
isabel
she
is
dead
oh
yes
but
they
will
not
be
the
less
pointed
at
the
girl
especially
as
i
say
they
allude
to
their
mother
now
and
then
in
conversation
wilson
tells
me
but
i
would
recommend
you
madame
vine
not
to
encourage
them
in
that
they
had
better
forget
mr
carlyle
would
naturally
wish
them
to
do
most
certainly
there
is
little
doubt
that
carlyle
would
blot
out
the
recollection
of
her
were
it
possible
but
unfortunately
she
was
the
children
s
mother
and
for
that
there
s
no
help
i
trust
you
will
be
able
to
instill
principles
into
the
little
girl
which
will
keep
her
from
a
like
i
will
try
answered
lady
isabel
with
more
fervor
than
she
had
yet
spoken
do
you
have
the
children
much
with
you
may
i
inquire
no
i
never
was
fond
of
being
troubled
with
children
when
my
own
grow
up
into
childhood
i
shall
deem
the
nursery
and
the
schoolroom
the
fitter
place
for
them
what
i
trust
i
shall
never
give
up
to
another
will
be
the
training
of
my
children
pursued
barbara
let
the
offices
properly
pertaining
to
a
nurse
be
performed
by
the
nurse
of
course
taking
care
that
she
is
thoroughly
to
be
depended
on
let
her
have
the
trouble
of
the
children
their
noise
their
romping
in
short
let
the
nursery
be
her
place
and
the
children
s
but
i
hope
that
i
shall
never
fail
to
gather
my
children
round
me
daily
at
stated
and
convenient
periods
for
higher
purposes
to
instill
into
them
christian
and
moral
duties
to
strive
to
teach
them
how
best
to
fulfil
the
obligations
of
life
this
is
a
mother
s
task
as
i
understand
the
question
let
her
do
this
work
well
and
the
nurse
can
attend
to
the
rest
a
child
should
never
hear
aught
from
his
mother
s
lips
but
persuasive
gentleness
and
this
becomes
impossible
if
she
is
very
much
with
her
lady
isabel
silently
assented
carlyle
s
views
were
correct
ones
when
i
first
came
to
east
lynne
i
found
miss
manning
the
governess
was
doing
everything
necessary
for
carlyle
s
children
in
the
way
of
the
training
that
i
speak
of
resumed
barbara
she
had
them
with
her
for
a
short
period
every
morning
even
the
little
one
i
saw
that
it
was
all
right
therefore
did
not
interfere
since
she
left
it
is
nearly
a
month
now
i
have
taken
them
myself
we
were
sorry
to
part
with
miss
manning
she
suited
very
well
but
she
has
been
long
engaged
it
turns
out
to
an
officer
in
the
navy
and
now
they
are
to
be
married
you
will
have
the
entire
charge
of
the
little
girl
she
will
be
your
companion
out
of
school
hours
did
you
understand
that
i
am
quite
ready
and
willing
to
undertake
it
said
lady
isabel
her
heart
fluttering
are
the
children
well
do
they
enjoy
good
health
quite
so
they
had
the
measles
in
the
spring
and
the
illness
left
a
cough
upon
william
the
eldest
boy
wainwright
says
he
will
outgrow
he
has
it
still
then
at
night
and
morning
they
went
last
week
to
spend
the
day
with
miss
carlyle
and
were
a
little
late
in
returning
home
it
was
foggy
and
the
boy
coughed
dreadfully
after
he
came
in
carlyle
was
so
concerned
that
he
left
the
dinner
table
and
went
up
to
the
nursery
he
gave
joyce
strict
orders
that
the
child
should
never
again
be
out
in
the
evening
so
long
as
the
cough
was
upon
him
we
had
never
heard
him
cough
like
do
you
fear
consumption
asked
lady
isabel
in
a
low
tone
i
do
not
fear
that
or
any
other
incurable
disease
for
them
answered
barbara
i
think
with
wainwright
that
time
will
remove
the
cough
the
children
come
of
a
healthy
stock
on
the
father
s
side
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
they
do
not
on
their
mother
s
she
died
young
you
will
say
ay
but
she
did
not
die
of
disease
her
death
was
the
result
of
accident
latimer
wrote
us
word
you
were
of
gentle
birth
and
breeding
she
continued
changing
the
subject
of
conversation
i
am
sure
you
will
excuse
my
speaking
of
these
particulars
barbara
added
in
a
tone
of
apology
but
this
is
our
first
interview
our
preliminary
interview
it
may
in
a
measure
be
called
for
we
could
not
say
much
by
i
was
born
and
reared
a
gentlewoman
answered
lady
isabel
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
there
is
no
mistaking
the
tone
of
a
gentlewoman
said
barbara
how
sad
it
is
when
pecuniary
reverses
fall
upon
us
i
dare
say
you
never
thought
to
go
out
as
a
a
half
smile
positively
crossed
her
lips
she
think
to
go
out
as
a
governess
the
earl
of
mount
severn
s
only
child
oh
no
never
she
said
in
reply
your
husband
i
fear
could
not
leave
you
well
off
latimer
said
something
to
that
when
i
lost
him
i
lost
all
was
the
answer
and
carlyle
was
struck
with
the
wailing
pain
betrayed
in
the
tone
at
that
moment
a
maid
entered
nurse
says
the
baby
is
undressed
and
quite
ready
for
you
ma
am
she
said
addressing
her
mistress
carlyle
rose
but
hesitated
as
she
was
moving
away
i
will
have
the
baby
here
she
said
to
the
girl
tell
nurse
to
put
a
shawl
round
him
and
bring
him
down
it
is
the
hour
for
my
baby
s
supper
she
smiled
turning
to
lady
isabel
i
may
as
well
have
him
here
for
once
as
carlyle
is
out
sometimes
i
am
out
myself
and
then
he
has
to
be
you
do
not
stay
indoors
for
the
baby
then
certainly
not
if
i
and
carlyle
have
to
be
out
in
the
evening
baby
gives
way
i
should
never
give
up
my
husband
for
my
baby
never
never
dearly
as
i
love
the
nurse
came
in
wilson
she
unfolded
a
shawl
and
placed
the
baby
on
carlyle
s
lap
a
proud
fine
fair
young
baby
who
reared
his
head
and
opened
wide
his
great
blue
eyes
and
beat
his
arms
at
the
lights
of
the
chandelier
as
no
baby
of
nearly
six
months
ever
did
yet
so
thought
barbara
he
was
in
his
clean
white
nightgown
and
nightcap
with
their
pretty
crimped
frills
and
border
altogether
a
pleasant
sight
to
look
upon
she
had
once
sat
in
that
very
chair
with
a
baby
as
fair
upon
her
own
knee
but
all
that
was
past
and
gone
she
leaned
her
hot
head
upon
her
hand
and
a
rebellious
sigh
of
envy
went
forth
from
her
aching
heart
wilson
the
curious
was
devouring
her
with
her
eyes
wilson
was
thinking
she
never
saw
such
a
mortal
fright
as
the
new
governess
them
blue
spectacles
capped
everything
she
decided
and
what
on
earth
made
her
tie
up
her
throat
in
that
fashion
as
well
wear
a
man
s
color
and
stock
at
once
if
her
teaching
was
no
better
than
her
looks
miss
lucy
might
as
well
go
to
the
parish
charity
school
shall
i
wait
ma
am
demurely
asked
wilson
her
investigation
being
concluded
no
said
carlyle
i
will
baby
was
exceedingly
busy
taking
his
supper
and
of
course
according
to
all
baby
precedent
he
ought
to
have
gone
off
into
a
sound
sleep
over
it
but
the
supper
concluded
and
the
gentleman
seemed
to
have
no
more
sleep
in
his
eyes
than
he
had
before
he
began
he
sat
up
crowed
at
the
lights
stretched
out
his
hands
for
them
and
set
his
mother
at
defiance
absolutely
refusing
to
be
hushed
up
do
you
wish
to
keep
awake
all
night
you
rebel
cried
barbara
fondly
looking
on
him
a
loud
crow
by
way
of
answer
perhaps
it
was
intended
to
intimate
he
did
she
clasped
him
to
her
with
a
sudden
gesture
of
rapture
a
sound
of
love
and
devoured
his
pretty
face
with
kisses
then
she
took
him
in
her
arms
putting
him
to
sit
upright
and
approached
madame
vine
did
you
ever
see
a
more
lovely
child
a
fine
baby
indeed
she
constrained
herself
to
answer
and
she
could
have
fancied
it
her
own
little
archibald
over
again
when
he
was
a
baby
but
he
is
not
much
like
he
is
the
very
image
of
my
darling
husband
when
you
see
carlyle
barbara
stopped
and
bent
her
ear
as
listening
mr
carlyle
is
probably
a
handsome
man
said
poor
lady
isabel
believing
that
the
pause
was
made
to
give
her
an
opportunity
of
putting
in
an
observation
he
is
handsome
but
that
is
the
least
good
about
him
he
is
the
most
noble
man
revered
respected
by
everyone
i
may
say
loved
the
only
one
who
could
not
appreciate
him
was
his
wife
and
we
must
assume
that
she
did
not
by
the
ending
that
came
however
she
could
leave
him
how
she
could
even
look
at
another
after
calling
carlyle
husband
will
always
be
a
marvel
to
those
who
know
a
bitter
groan
and
it
nearly
escaped
her
lips
that
certainly
is
the
pony
carriage
cried
barbara
bending
her
ear
again
if
so
how
very
early
carlyle
is
home
yes
i
am
sure
it
is
the
sound
of
the
how
lady
isabel
sat
she
scarcely
knew
how
she
concealed
her
trepidation
she
never
would
know
a
pause
an
entrance
to
the
hall
barbara
baby
in
arms
advanced
to
the
door
and
a
tall
form
entered
once
more
lady
isabel
was
in
the
presence
of
her
sometime
husband
he
did
not
perceive
that
any
one
was
present
and
he
bent
his
head
and
fondly
kissed
his
wife
isabel
s
jealous
eyes
were
turned
upon
them
she
saw
barbara
s
passionate
lingering
kiss
in
return
she
heard
her
fervent
whispered
greeting
my
darling
and
she
watched
him
turn
to
press
the
same
fond
kisses
on
the
rosy
open
lips
of
his
child
isabel
flung
her
hand
over
her
face
had
she
bargained
for
this
it
was
part
of
the
cross
she
had
undertaken
to
carry
and
she
must
bear
it
carlyle
came
forward
and
saw
her
he
looked
somewhat
surprised
madame
vine
said
barbara
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
welcomed
her
in
the
same
cordial
pleasant
manner
that
his
wife
had
done
she
put
her
shaking
hand
into
his
there
was
no
help
for
it
little
thought
carlyle
that
that
hand
had
been
tenderly
clasped
in
his
a
thousand
times
that
it
was
the
one
pledged
to
him
at
the
altar
of
castle
marling
she
sat
down
on
her
chair
again
unable
to
stand
feeling
as
though
every
drop
of
blood
within
her
had
left
her
body
it
had
certainly
left
her
face
carlyle
made
a
few
civil
inquiries
as
to
her
journey
but
she
did
not
dare
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
as
she
breathed
forth
the
answers
you
are
at
home
soon
archibald
said
barbara
addressing
him
i
did
not
expect
you
so
early
i
did
not
think
you
could
get
away
do
you
know
what
i
was
wishing
she
continued
papa
is
going
to
london
with
squire
pinner
to
see
those
new
agricultural
implements
or
whatever
it
is
they
are
sure
to
be
away
as
much
as
three
days
i
was
thinking
if
we
could
but
persuade
mamma
to
come
to
us
for
the
time
papa
is
to
be
away
it
would
be
a
delightful
little
change
for
her
a
break
in
her
monotonous
i
wish
you
could
warmly
spoke
carlyle
her
life
since
you
left
is
a
monotonous
one
though
in
her
gentle
patience
she
will
not
say
so
it
is
a
happy
thought
barbara
and
i
only
hope
it
may
be
carried
out
carlyle
s
mother
is
an
invalid
and
lonely
for
she
has
no
child
at
home
with
her
now
he
added
in
a
spirit
of
politeness
addressing
himself
to
madame
vine
she
simply
bowed
her
head
trust
herself
to
speak
she
did
not
carlyle
scanned
her
face
attentively
as
she
sat
her
spectacles
bent
downward
she
did
not
appear
inclined
to
be
sociable
and
he
turned
to
the
baby
who
was
wider
awake
than
ever
young
sir
i
should
like
to
know
what
brings
you
up
and
here
at
this
you
may
well
ask
said
barbara
i
just
had
him
brought
down
as
you
were
not
here
thinking
he
would
be
asleep
directly
and
only
look
at
him
no
more
sleep
in
his
eyes
than
there
is
in
she
would
have
hushed
him
to
her
as
she
spoke
but
the
young
gentleman
stoutly
repudiated
it
he
set
up
a
half
cry
and
struggled
his
arms
and
head
free
again
crowing
the
next
moment
most
impudently
carlyle
took
him
it
is
no
use
barbara
he
is
beyond
your
coaxing
this
and
he
tossed
the
child
in
his
strong
arms
held
him
up
to
the
chandelier
made
him
bob
at
the
baby
in
the
until
the
rebel
was
in
an
ecstacy
of
delight
finally
he
smothered
his
face
with
kisses
as
barbara
had
done
barbara
rang
the
bell
oh
can
you
imagine
what
it
was
for
lady
isabel
so
had
he
tossed
so
had
he
kissed
her
children
she
standing
by
the
fond
proud
happy
mother
as
barbara
was
standing
now
carlyle
came
up
to
her
are
you
fond
of
these
little
troubles
madame
vine
this
one
is
a
fine
fellow
they
very
fine
what
is
his
name
she
replied
by
way
of
saying
something
arthur
archibald
put
in
barbara
to
madame
vine
i
was
vexed
that
his
name
could
not
be
entirely
archibald
but
that
was
already
monopolized
is
that
you
wilson
i
don
t
know
what
you
ll
do
with
him
but
he
looks
as
if
he
would
not
be
asleep
by
twelve
o
wilson
with
a
fresh
satisfying
of
her
curiosity
by
taking
another
prolonged
stare
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
at
madame
vine
received
the
baby
from
carlyle
and
departed
with
him
madame
vine
rose
would
they
excuse
her
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
she
was
tired
and
would
be
glad
to
retire
to
of
course
and
anything
she
might
wish
in
the
way
of
refreshment
would
she
ring
for
barbara
shook
hands
with
her
in
her
friendly
way
and
carlyle
crossed
the
room
to
open
the
door
for
her
and
bowed
her
out
with
a
courtly
smile
she
went
up
to
her
chamber
at
once
to
rest
well
what
think
you
she
strove
to
say
to
her
lacerated
and
remorseful
heart
that
the
cross
far
heavier
though
it
was
proving
than
anything
she
had
imagined
or
pictured
was
only
what
she
had
brought
upon
herself
and
must
bear
very
true
but
none
of
us
would
like
such
a
cross
to
be
upon
our
shoulders
is
she
not
droll
looking
cried
barbara
when
she
was
alone
with
carlyle
i
can
t
think
why
she
wears
those
blue
spectacles
it
can
not
be
for
her
sight
and
they
are
very
she
puts
me
in
mind
of
of
began
carlyle
in
a
dreamy
tone
of
whom
her
face
i
mean
he
said
still
dreaming
so
little
can
be
seen
of
it
resumed
carlyle
of
whom
does
she
put
you
in
mind
i
don
t
know
nobody
in
particular
returned
he
rousing
himself
let
us
have
tea
in
chapter
xxxiii
the
yearning
of
a
breaking
heart
at
her
bedroom
door
the
next
morning
stood
lady
isabel
listening
whether
the
coast
was
clear
ere
she
descended
to
the
gray
parlor
for
she
had
a
shrinking
dread
of
encountering
carlyle
when
he
was
glancing
narrowly
at
her
face
the
previous
evening
she
had
felt
the
gaze
and
it
impressed
upon
her
the
dread
of
his
recognition
not
only
that
he
was
the
husband
of
another
therefore
it
was
not
expedient
that
she
should
see
too
much
of
him
for
he
was
far
dearer
to
her
than
he
had
ever
been
almost
at
the
same
moment
there
burst
out
of
a
remote
room
the
upright
fair
noble
boy
of
some
five
years
old
who
began
careering
along
on
the
corridor
astride
upon
a
she
did
not
need
to
be
told
it
was
her
boy
archibald
his
likeness
to
carlyle
would
have
proclaimed
it
even
if
her
heart
had
not
in
an
impulse
of
unrestrainable
tenderness
she
seized
the
child
as
he
was
galloping
past
her
and
carried
him
into
her
room
broom
and
all
you
must
let
me
make
acquaintance
with
you
she
said
to
him
by
way
of
excuse
i
love
little
love
down
she
sat
upon
a
low
chair
the
child
held
upon
her
lap
kissing
him
passionately
and
the
tears
raining
from
her
eyes
she
could
not
have
helped
the
tears
had
it
been
to
save
her
life
she
could
as
little
have
helped
the
kisses
lifting
her
eyes
there
stood
wilson
who
had
entered
without
ceremony
a
sick
feeling
came
over
lady
isabel
she
felt
as
if
she
had
betrayed
herself
all
that
could
be
done
now
was
to
make
the
best
of
it
to
offer
some
lame
excuse
what
possessed
her
thus
to
forget
herself
he
did
so
put
me
in
remembrance
of
my
own
children
she
said
to
wilson
gulping
down
her
emotion
and
hiding
her
tears
in
the
best
manner
she
could
whilst
the
astonished
archibald
released
now
stood
with
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
stared
at
her
spectacles
his
great
blue
eyes
opened
to
their
utmost
width
when
we
have
lost
children
of
our
own
we
are
apt
to
love
fondly
all
we
come
wilson
who
stared
only
in
a
less
degree
than
archie
for
she
deemed
the
new
governess
had
gone
suddenly
mad
gave
some
voluble
assent
and
turned
her
attention
upon
archie
you
naughty
young
monkey
how
dare
you
rush
out
in
that
way
with
sarah
s
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
sir
you
are
getting
a
might
deal
too
owdacious
and
rumbustical
for
the
nursery
i
shall
speak
to
your
mamma
about
she
seized
hold
of
the
child
and
shook
him
lady
isabel
started
forward
her
hands
up
her
voice
one
of
painful
entreaty
oh
don
t
don
t
beat
him
i
can
not
see
him
beaten
echoed
wilson
if
he
got
a
good
beating
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
him
but
it
s
what
he
never
does
get
a
little
shake
or
a
tap
is
all
i
must
give
and
it
s
not
half
enough
you
wouldn
t
believe
the
sturdy
impudence
of
that
boy
madame
he
runs
riot
he
does
the
other
two
never
gave
a
quarter
of
the
trouble
come
along
you
figure
i
ll
have
a
bolt
put
at
the
top
of
the
nursery
door
and
if
i
did
he
d
be
for
climbing
up
the
to
get
at
the
last
sentence
wilson
delivered
to
the
governess
as
she
jerked
archie
out
of
the
room
along
the
passage
and
into
the
nursery
lady
isabel
sat
down
with
a
wrung
heart
a
chafed
spirit
her
own
child
and
she
might
not
say
to
the
servant
you
shall
not
beat
him
she
descended
to
the
gray
parlor
the
two
older
children
and
breakfast
were
waiting
joyce
quitted
the
room
when
she
entered
it
a
graceful
girl
of
eight
years
old
a
fragile
boy
a
year
younger
both
bearing
her
once
lovely
features
her
once
bright
and
delicate
complexion
her
large
soft
brown
eyes
how
utterly
her
heart
yearned
to
them
but
there
must
be
no
scene
like
there
had
just
been
above
nevertheless
she
stooped
and
kissed
them
both
one
kiss
each
of
impassioned
fervor
lucy
was
naturally
silent
william
somewhat
talkative
you
are
our
new
governess
said
he
yes
we
must
be
good
why
not
said
the
boy
we
were
good
friends
with
miss
manning
i
am
to
go
into
latin
soon
as
soon
as
my
cough
s
gone
do
you
know
latin
no
not
to
teach
it
she
said
studiously
avoiding
all
endearing
epithets
papa
said
you
would
be
almost
sure
not
to
know
latin
for
that
ladies
rarely
did
he
said
he
should
send
up
kane
to
teach
mr
kane
repeated
lady
isabel
the
name
striking
upon
her
memory
mr
kane
the
how
did
you
know
he
was
a
cried
shrewd
william
and
lady
isabel
felt
the
red
blood
flush
to
her
face
at
the
unlucky
admission
she
had
made
it
flushed
deeper
at
her
own
falsehood
as
she
muttered
some
evasive
words
about
hearing
of
him
from
latimer
yes
he
is
a
but
he
does
not
get
much
money
at
it
and
he
teaches
the
classics
as
well
he
has
come
up
to
teach
us
music
since
miss
manning
left
mamma
said
that
we
ought
not
to
lose
our
mamma
how
the
word
applied
to
barbara
grated
on
her
ear
whom
does
he
teach
she
asked
us
two
replied
william
pointing
to
his
sister
and
himself
do
you
always
take
bread
and
milk
she
inquired
perceiving
that
to
be
what
they
were
eating
we
get
tired
of
it
sometimes
and
then
we
have
milk
and
water
and
bread
and
butter
or
honey
and
then
we
take
to
bread
and
milk
again
it
s
aunt
cornelia
who
thinks
we
should
eat
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
she
says
papa
never
had
anything
else
when
he
was
a
lucy
looked
up
papa
would
give
me
an
egg
when
i
breakfasted
with
him
cried
she
and
aunt
cornelia
said
it
was
not
good
for
me
but
papa
gave
it
to
me
all
the
same
i
always
had
breakfast
with
him
and
why
do
you
not
now
asked
lady
isabel
i
don
t
know
i
have
not
since
mamma
the
word
stepmother
rose
up
rebelliously
in
the
heart
of
lady
isabel
was
carlyle
putting
away
the
children
from
their
father
breakfast
over
she
gathered
them
to
her
asking
them
various
questions
about
their
studies
their
hours
of
recreation
the
daily
routine
of
their
lives
this
is
not
the
schoolroom
you
know
cried
william
when
she
made
some
inquiry
as
to
their
books
no
the
schoolroom
is
upstairs
this
is
for
our
meals
and
for
you
in
an
the
voice
of
carlyle
was
heard
at
this
juncture
in
the
hall
and
lucy
was
springing
toward
the
sound
lady
isabel
fearful
lest
he
might
enter
if
the
child
showed
herself
stopped
her
with
a
hurried
hand
stay
here
her
name
s
lucy
said
william
looking
quickly
up
why
do
you
call
her
isabel
i
thought
thought
i
had
heard
her
called
isabel
stammered
the
unfortunate
lady
feeling
quite
confused
with
the
errors
she
was
committing
my
name
is
isabel
lucy
said
the
child
but
i
don
t
know
who
could
have
told
you
for
i
am
never
called
isabel
i
have
not
been
since
since
shall
i
tell
you
since
mamma
went
away
she
concluded
dropping
her
voice
mamma
that
was
you
did
she
go
cried
lady
isabel
full
of
emotion
and
possessing
a
very
faint
idea
of
what
she
was
saying
she
was
kidnapped
whispered
lucy
kidnapped
was
the
surprised
answer
yes
or
she
would
not
have
gone
there
was
a
wicked
man
on
a
visit
to
papa
and
he
stole
her
wilson
said
she
knew
he
was
a
kidnapper
before
he
took
mamma
papa
said
i
was
never
to
be
called
isabel
again
but
lucy
isabel
was
mamma
s
how
do
you
know
papa
said
it
dreamily
returned
lady
isabel
i
heard
him
he
said
it
to
joyce
and
joyce
told
the
servants
i
put
only
lucy
to
my
copies
i
did
put
isabel
lucy
but
papa
saw
it
one
day
and
he
drew
his
pencil
through
isabel
and
told
me
to
show
it
to
miss
manning
after
that
miss
manning
let
me
put
nothing
but
lucy
i
asked
her
why
and
she
told
me
papa
preferred
the
name
and
that
i
was
not
to
ask
she
could
not
well
stop
the
child
but
every
word
was
rending
her
heart
lady
isabel
was
our
very
very
own
mamma
pursued
lucy
this
mamma
is
do
you
love
this
one
as
you
did
the
other
breathed
lady
isabel
oh
i
loved
mamma
i
loved
mamma
uttered
lucy
clasping
her
hands
but
it
s
all
over
wilson
said
we
must
not
love
her
any
longer
and
aunt
cornelia
said
it
wilson
said
if
she
loved
us
she
would
not
have
gone
away
from
wilson
said
so
resentfully
spoke
lady
isabel
she
said
she
need
not
let
that
man
kidnap
her
i
am
afraid
he
beat
her
for
she
died
i
lie
in
my
bed
at
night
and
wonder
whether
he
did
beat
her
and
what
made
her
die
it
was
after
she
died
that
our
new
mamma
came
home
papa
said
that
she
was
to
be
our
mamma
in
place
of
lady
isabel
and
we
were
to
love
her
do
you
love
her
almost
passionately
asked
lady
isabel
lucy
shook
her
head
not
as
i
loved
joyce
entered
to
show
the
way
to
the
schoolroom
and
they
followed
her
upstairs
as
lady
isabel
stood
at
the
window
she
saw
carlyle
depart
on
foot
on
his
way
to
the
office
barbara
was
with
him
hanging
fondly
on
his
arm
about
to
accompany
him
to
the
park
gates
so
had
she
fondly
hung
so
had
she
accompanied
him
in
the
days
gone
forever
barbara
came
into
the
schoolroom
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
entered
upon
the
subject
of
their
studies
the
different
allotted
hours
some
to
play
some
to
work
she
spoke
in
a
courteous
but
decided
tone
showing
that
she
was
the
unmistakable
mistress
of
the
house
and
children
and
meant
to
be
never
had
lady
isabel
felt
her
position
so
keenly
never
did
it
so
gall
and
fret
her
spirit
but
she
bowed
to
meek
obedience
a
hundred
times
that
day
did
she
yearn
to
hold
the
children
to
her
heart
and
a
hundred
times
she
had
to
repress
the
longing
in
a
soft
damask
dress
not
unlike
the
color
of
the
walls
from
which
the
room
took
its
name
a
cap
of
honiton
lace
shading
her
delicate
features
sat
hare
the
justice
was
in
london
with
squire
pinner
and
barbara
had
gone
to
the
grove
and
brought
her
mamma
away
in
triumph
it
was
evening
now
and
hare
was
paying
a
visit
to
the
gray
parlor
miss
carlyle
had
been
dining
there
and
lady
isabel
under
plea
of
a
violent
headache
had
begged
to
decline
the
invitation
to
take
tea
in
the
for
she
feared
the
sharp
eyes
of
miss
carlyle
barbara
upon
leaving
the
went
to
the
nursery
as
usual
to
her
baby
and
hare
took
the
opportunity
to
go
and
sit
a
few
minutes
with
the
governess
she
feared
the
governess
must
be
very
lonely
miss
carlyle
scorning
usage
and
ceremony
had
remained
in
the
with
carlyle
a
lecture
for
him
upon
some
defalcation
or
other
most
probably
in
store
lady
isabel
was
alone
lucy
had
gone
to
keep
a
birthday
in
the
neighborhood
and
william
was
in
the
nursery
hare
found
her
in
a
sad
attitude
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
temples
she
had
not
yet
made
acquaintance
with
her
beyond
a
minute
s
formal
introduction
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
are
not
well
this
evening
she
gently
said
thank
you
my
head
aches
much
which
was
no
false
plea
i
fear
you
must
feel
your
solitude
irksome
it
is
dull
for
you
to
be
here
all
i
am
so
used
to
hare
sat
down
and
gazed
with
sympathy
at
the
young
though
somewhat
woman
before
her
she
detected
the
signs
of
mental
suffering
on
her
face
you
have
seen
sorrow
she
uttered
bending
forward
and
speaking
with
the
utmost
sweetness
oh
great
sorrow
burst
from
lady
isabel
for
her
wretched
fate
was
very
palpable
to
her
mind
that
evening
and
the
tone
of
sympathy
rendered
it
nearly
irrepressible
my
daughter
tells
me
that
you
have
lost
your
children
and
you
have
lost
your
fortune
and
position
indeed
i
feel
for
you
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
this
did
not
decrease
her
anguish
she
completely
lost
all
self
control
and
a
gush
of
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
don
t
pity
me
don
t
pity
me
dear
hare
indeed
it
only
makes
endurance
harder
some
of
us
she
added
looking
up
with
a
sickly
smile
are
born
to
we
are
all
born
to
it
cried
hare
i
in
truth
have
cause
to
say
so
oh
you
know
not
what
my
position
has
been
the
terrible
weight
of
grief
that
i
have
to
bear
for
many
years
i
can
truly
say
that
i
have
not
known
one
completely
happy
all
do
not
have
to
bear
this
killing
sorrow
said
lady
isabel
rely
upon
it
sorrow
of
some
nature
does
sooner
or
later
come
to
all
in
the
brightest
apparent
lot
on
earth
dark
days
must
mix
not
that
there
is
a
doubt
but
that
it
falls
unequally
some
as
you
observe
seem
born
to
it
for
it
clings
to
them
all
their
days
others
are
more
favored
as
we
reckon
favor
perhaps
this
great
amount
of
trouble
is
no
more
than
is
necessary
to
take
us
to
heaven
you
know
the
saying
adversity
hardens
the
heart
or
it
opens
it
to
it
may
be
that
our
hearts
continue
so
hard
that
the
life
s
trouble
is
requisite
to
soften
them
my
dear
hare
added
in
a
lower
tone
while
the
tears
glistened
on
her
pale
cheeks
there
will
be
a
blessed
rest
for
the
weary
when
this
toilsome
life
is
ended
let
us
find
comfort
in
that
ay
ay
murmured
lady
isabel
it
is
all
that
is
left
to
you
are
young
to
have
acquired
so
much
experience
of
we
can
not
estimate
sorrow
by
years
we
may
live
a
whole
lifetime
of
it
in
a
single
hour
but
we
generally
bring
ill
fate
upon
ourselves
she
continued
in
a
desperation
of
remorse
as
our
conduct
is
so
will
our
happiness
or
misery
not
always
sighed
hare
sorrow
i
grant
you
does
come
all
too
frequently
from
but
the
worst
is
the
consequences
of
this
fall
upon
the
innocent
as
well
as
upon
the
guilty
a
husband
s
errors
will
involve
his
innocent
wife
parent
s
sins
fall
upon
their
children
children
will
break
the
hearts
of
their
parents
i
can
truly
say
speaking
in
all
humble
submission
that
i
am
unconscious
of
having
deserved
the
great
sorrow
which
came
upon
me
that
no
act
of
mine
invited
it
on
but
though
it
has
nearly
killed
me
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
it
is
lined
with
mercy
if
i
could
only
bring
my
weak
rebellious
heart
to
look
for
it
you
i
feel
sure
have
been
equally
she
hare
marked
not
the
flush
of
shame
the
drooping
of
the
eyelids
you
have
lost
your
little
ones
hare
resumed
that
is
grief
great
grief
i
would
not
underrate
it
but
believe
me
it
is
as
nothing
compared
to
the
awful
fate
should
it
ever
fall
upon
you
of
finding
your
children
grow
up
and
become
that
which
makes
you
wish
they
had
died
in
their
infancy
there
are
times
when
i
am
tempted
to
regret
that
all
my
treasures
are
not
in
that
other
world
that
they
had
not
gone
before
me
yes
sorrow
is
the
lot
of
surely
not
of
all
dissented
lady
isabel
there
are
some
bright
lots
on
there
is
not
a
lot
but
must
bear
its
appointed
share
returned
hare
bright
as
it
may
appear
ay
and
as
it
may
continue
to
be
for
years
depend
upon
it
some
darkness
must
overshadow
it
earlier
or
mr
and
carlyle
what
sorrow
can
there
be
in
store
for
them
asked
lady
isabel
her
voice
ringing
with
a
strange
sound
which
hare
noted
though
she
understood
it
not
mrs
carlyle
s
lot
is
bright
she
said
a
sweet
smile
illumining
her
features
she
loves
her
husband
with
an
impassioned
love
and
he
is
worthy
of
it
a
happy
fate
indeed
is
hers
but
she
must
not
expect
to
be
exempted
from
sorrow
carlyle
has
had
his
share
of
it
continued
hare
ah
you
have
doubtless
been
made
acquainted
with
his
history
his
first
wife
left
him
left
home
and
her
children
he
bore
it
bravely
before
the
world
but
i
know
that
it
wrung
his
very
she
was
his
heart
s
sole
she
not
barbara
the
moment
the
word
barbara
had
escaped
her
lips
lady
isabel
recollected
herself
she
was
only
madame
vine
the
governess
what
would
hare
think
of
her
familiarity
hare
did
not
appear
to
have
noticed
it
she
was
absorbed
in
the
subject
barbara
she
uttered
certainly
not
had
his
first
love
been
given
to
barbara
he
would
have
chosen
her
then
it
was
given
to
lady
it
is
given
his
wife
now
hare
nearly
laughed
of
course
it
is
would
you
wish
it
to
be
buried
in
the
grave
with
the
dead
and
with
one
who
was
false
to
him
but
my
dear
she
was
the
sweetest
woman
that
unfortunate
lady
isabel
i
loved
her
then
and
i
can
not
help
loving
her
still
others
blamed
her
but
i
pitied
they
were
well
matched
he
so
good
and
noble
she
so
lovely
and
and
she
left
him
threw
him
to
the
winds
with
all
his
nobility
and
love
exclaimed
the
poor
governess
with
a
gesture
of
the
hands
that
looked
very
much
like
despair
yes
it
will
not
do
to
talk
of
it
is
a
miserable
subject
how
she
could
abandon
such
a
husband
such
children
was
a
marvel
to
many
but
to
none
more
than
it
was
to
me
and
my
daughter
the
false
step
though
i
feel
almost
ashamed
to
speak
out
the
thought
lest
it
may
appear
to
savor
of
triumph
while
it
must
have
secured
her
own
wretchedness
led
to
the
happiness
of
my
child
for
it
is
certain
barbara
would
never
love
one
as
she
loves
it
did
secure
wretchedness
to
her
you
think
cried
lady
isabel
her
tone
one
of
bitter
mockery
more
than
anything
else
hare
was
surprised
at
the
question
no
woman
ever
took
that
fatal
step
yet
without
its
entailing
on
her
the
most
dire
wretchedness
she
replied
it
can
not
be
otherwise
and
lady
isabel
was
of
a
nature
to
feel
remorse
beyond
common
to
meet
it
refined
modest
with
every
feeling
of
an
english
gentlewoman
she
was
the
very
last
one
would
have
thought
to
act
so
it
was
as
if
she
had
gone
away
in
a
dream
not
knowing
what
she
was
doing
i
have
thought
so
many
a
time
that
terrible
mental
wretchedness
and
remorse
did
overtake
her
i
how
did
you
know
it
did
you
hear
it
exclaimed
lady
isabel
her
tone
all
too
eager
had
hare
been
suspicious
did
he
proclaim
that
francis
levison
did
you
hear
it
from
him
hare
gentle
hare
drew
herself
up
for
the
words
grated
on
her
feelings
and
on
her
pride
another
moment
and
she
was
mild
and
kind
again
for
she
reflected
that
the
poor
sorrowful
governess
must
have
spoken
without
thought
i
know
not
what
sir
francis
levison
may
have
chose
to
proclaim
she
said
but
you
may
be
sure
he
would
not
be
allowed
opportunity
to
proclaim
anything
to
me
or
to
any
other
friend
of
carlyle
s
nay
i
should
say
nor
to
any
of
the
good
and
honorable
i
heard
it
from
lord
mount
from
lord
mount
severn
repeated
lady
isabel
and
she
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
more
but
closed
them
again
he
was
here
on
a
visit
in
the
summer
he
stayed
a
fortnight
lady
isabel
was
the
daughter
of
the
late
earl
perhaps
you
may
not
have
known
that
he
lord
mount
severn
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
had
sought
out
lady
isabel
when
the
man
levison
left
her
he
found
her
sick
poor
in
some
remote
french
town
utterly
borne
down
with
remorse
and
could
it
be
otherwise
sharply
asked
lady
isabel
my
dear
i
have
said
it
could
not
the
very
thought
of
her
deserted
children
would
entail
it
if
nothing
she
did
there
was
a
baby
born
abroad
added
hare
dropping
her
voice
an
infant
in
its
cradle
lord
mount
severn
said
but
that
child
we
knew
could
only
bring
pain
and
true
issued
from
her
trembling
lips
next
came
her
death
and
i
can
not
but
think
it
was
sent
to
her
in
mercy
i
trust
she
was
prepared
for
it
and
had
made
her
peace
with
god
when
all
else
is
taken
from
us
we
turn
to
him
i
hope
she
had
learned
to
find
the
how
did
carlyle
receive
the
news
of
her
death
murmured
lady
isabel
a
question
which
had
been
often
in
her
thoughts
i
can
not
tell
he
made
no
outward
sign
either
of
satisfaction
or
grief
it
was
too
delicate
a
subject
for
any
one
to
enter
upon
with
him
and
most
assuredly
he
did
not
enter
upon
it
himself
after
he
was
engaged
to
my
child
he
told
me
he
should
never
have
married
during
lady
isabel
s
from
from
the
remains
of
affection
i
should
think
not
i
inferred
it
to
be
from
conscientious
scruples
all
his
affection
is
given
to
his
present
wife
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
loves
her
with
a
true
a
fervent
a
lasting
love
though
there
may
have
been
more
romantic
sentiment
in
the
early
passion
felt
for
lady
isabel
poor
thing
she
gave
up
a
sincere
heart
a
happy
ay
poor
thing
she
had
very
nearly
wailed
forth
her
vain
despair
i
wonder
whether
the
is
tenanted
yet
smiled
hare
breaking
a
pause
which
had
ensued
if
so
i
suppose
they
will
be
expecting
me
i
will
ascertain
for
you
said
lady
isabel
speaking
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
for
she
was
craving
an
instant
to
herself
even
though
it
were
but
in
the
next
hall
she
quitted
the
gray
parlor
and
approached
the
not
a
sound
came
from
it
and
believing
it
was
empty
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
cautiously
in
quite
empty
the
fire
blazed
the
chandelier
was
lighted
but
nobody
was
enjoying
the
warmth
or
the
light
from
the
inner
room
however
came
the
sound
of
the
piano
and
the
tones
of
carlyle
s
voice
she
recognized
the
chords
of
the
music
they
were
those
of
the
accompaniment
to
the
song
he
had
so
loved
when
she
sang
it
him
who
was
about
to
sing
it
to
him
now
lady
isabel
stole
across
the
to
the
other
door
which
was
ajar
barbara
was
seated
at
the
piano
and
carlyle
stood
by
her
his
arm
on
her
chair
and
bending
his
face
on
a
level
with
hers
possibly
to
look
at
the
music
so
once
had
stolen
so
once
had
peeped
the
unhappy
barbara
to
hear
this
selfsame
song
she
had
been
his
wife
then
she
had
craved
and
received
his
kisses
when
it
was
over
their
positions
were
reversed
barbara
began
her
voice
had
not
the
brilliant
power
of
lady
isabel
s
but
it
was
a
sweet
and
pleasant
voice
to
listen
to
when
other
lips
and
other
hearts
their
tales
of
love
shall
tell
in
language
whose
excess
imparts
the
power
they
feel
so
well
there
may
perhaps
in
such
a
scene
some
recollection
be
of
days
that
have
as
happy
been
and
you
ll
remember
days
that
had
as
happy
been
ay
did
he
remember
her
did
a
thought
of
her
his
first
and
best
love
flit
across
him
as
the
words
fell
on
his
ear
did
a
past
vision
of
the
time
when
she
had
sat
there
and
sung
it
to
him
arouse
his
heart
to
even
momentary
recollection
terribly
indeed
were
their
positions
reversed
most
terribly
was
she
feeling
it
and
by
whose
act
and
will
had
the
change
been
wrought
barbara
was
now
the
cherished
wife
east
lynne
s
mistress
and
what
was
she
not
even
the
courted
welcomed
guest
of
an
hour
as
barbara
had
been
but
an
interloper
a
criminal
woman
who
had
thrust
herself
into
the
house
her
act
in
doing
so
not
justifiable
her
position
a
most
false
one
was
it
right
even
if
she
did
succeed
in
remaining
undiscovered
that
she
and
barbara
should
dwell
in
the
same
habitation
carlyle
being
in
it
did
she
deem
it
to
be
right
no
she
did
not
but
one
act
of
entails
more
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
mind
as
she
stood
there
listening
to
the
song
stood
there
as
one
turned
to
stone
her
throbbing
temples
pressed
against
the
door
s
pillar
the
song
was
over
and
barbara
turned
to
her
husband
a
whole
world
of
love
in
her
bright
blue
eyes
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
lady
isabel
saw
that
but
she
would
not
wait
to
see
the
caress
that
most
probably
followed
it
she
turned
and
crossed
the
room
again
her
hands
clasped
tightly
on
her
bosom
her
breath
catching
itself
in
hysterical
sobs
miss
carlyle
was
entering
the
hall
they
had
not
yet
met
and
lady
isabel
swept
meekly
past
her
with
a
hurried
courtesy
miss
carlyle
spoke
but
she
dared
not
answer
to
wait
would
have
been
to
betray
herself
sunday
came
and
that
was
the
worst
of
all
in
the
old
east
lynne
pew
at
jude
s
so
conspicuous
to
the
congregation
sat
she
as
in
former
times
no
excuse
dared
she
the
governess
make
to
remain
away
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
entered
an
english
protestant
church
since
she
had
last
sat
in
it
there
with
carlyle
can
you
wonder
that
the
fact
alone
with
all
the
terrible
remembrances
it
brought
in
its
train
was
sufficient
to
overwhelm
her
with
emotion
she
sat
at
the
upper
end
now
with
lucy
barbara
occupied
the
place
that
had
been
hers
by
the
side
of
carlyle
barbara
there
in
her
own
right
his
wife
she
severed
from
him
forever
and
forever
she
scarcely
raised
her
head
she
tightened
her
thick
veil
over
her
face
she
kept
her
spectacles
bent
toward
the
ground
lucy
thought
she
must
be
crying
she
never
had
seen
anyone
so
still
at
church
before
lucy
was
mistaken
tears
came
not
to
solace
the
bitter
anguish
of
hopeless
remorse
how
she
sat
out
the
service
she
could
not
tell
she
could
not
tell
how
she
could
sit
out
other
services
as
the
sundays
came
round
the
congregation
did
not
forget
to
stare
at
her
what
an
extraordinary
looking
governess
carlyle
had
picked
up
they
went
out
when
it
was
over
and
carlyle
in
advance
she
humbly
following
them
with
lucy
she
glanced
aside
at
the
tomb
in
the
churchyard
s
corner
where
moldered
the
remains
of
her
father
and
a
yearning
cry
went
forth
from
the
very
depth
of
her
soul
oh
that
i
were
laid
there
with
him
why
did
i
come
back
again
to
east
lynne
why
truly
but
she
had
never
thought
that
her
cross
would
be
so
sharp
as
this
chapter
xxxiv
an
for
west
lynne
as
this
is
not
a
history
of
the
british
constitution
it
does
not
concern
it
to
relate
how
or
why
west
lynne
got
into
hot
water
with
the
house
of
commons
the
house
threatened
to
disfranchise
it
and
west
lynne
under
the
fear
went
into
mourning
for
its
sins
the
threat
was
not
carried
out
but
one
of
the
sitting
members
was
unseated
with
ignominy
and
sent
to
the
right
about
being
considerably
humiliated
thereby
and
in
disgust
with
west
lynne
he
retired
accordingly
and
a
fresh
writ
was
issued
west
lynne
then
returned
the
hon
attley
a
county
nobleman
s
son
but
he
died
in
the
very
midst
of
his
first
session
and
another
writ
had
to
be
issued
of
course
the
consideration
now
was
who
should
be
the
next
lucky
man
fixed
upon
all
the
notables
within
ten
miles
were
discussed
not
excepting
the
bench
justices
justice
hare
no
he
was
too
uncompromising
he
would
study
his
own
will
but
not
that
of
west
lynne
squire
pinner
he
never
made
a
speech
in
his
life
and
had
not
an
idea
beyond
turnips
and
farming
stock
colonel
bethel
he
had
no
money
to
spend
upon
an
election
sir
john
dobede
he
was
too
old
by
a
good
twenty
years
laughed
sir
john
to
himself
but
here
we
stand
like
a
pack
of
noodles
conning
over
the
incapables
and
passing
by
the
right
one
continued
sir
john
there
s
only
one
man
amongst
us
fit
to
be
our
who
s
that
cried
the
meeting
archibald
a
pause
of
consternation
consternation
at
their
collective
forgetfulness
and
then
a
loud
murmur
of
approaching
to
a
shout
filled
the
room
archibald
carlyle
it
should
be
no
other
if
we
can
get
him
cried
sir
john
he
may
decline
you
the
best
thing
all
agreed
was
to
act
promptly
a
deputation
half
the
length
of
the
street
its
whole
length
if
you
include
the
tagrag
and
bobtail
that
attended
behind
set
off
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
the
office
of
carlyle
they
found
that
gentleman
about
to
leave
it
for
the
evening
to
return
home
to
dinner
for
in
the
discussion
of
the
topic
the
meeting
had
suffered
time
to
run
on
to
a
late
hour
those
gentlemen
who
dined
at
a
somewhat
earlier
one
had
for
once
in
their
lives
patiently
allowed
their
dinners
and
their
stomachs
to
wait
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
for
the
patience
of
a
justice
carlyle
was
taken
by
surprise
make
me
your
member
cried
he
merrily
how
do
you
know
i
should
not
sell
you
all
we
ll
trust
you
carlyle
too
happy
to
do
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
spare
the
time
deliberated
carlyle
now
carlyle
you
must
remember
that
you
avowed
to
me
no
longer
than
last
christmas
your
intention
of
going
into
parliament
some
time
struck
in
justice
herbert
you
can
t
deny
some
time
yes
replied
carlyle
but
i
did
not
say
when
i
have
no
thoughts
of
it
yet
you
must
allow
us
to
put
you
in
nomination
you
must
indeed
carlyle
there
s
nobody
else
fit
for
it
as
good
send
a
pig
to
the
house
as
some
of
an
extremely
flattering
reason
for
proposing
to
shift
the
honor
upon
me
laughed
carlyle
well
you
know
what
we
mean
carlyle
there
s
not
a
man
in
the
whole
county
so
suitable
as
you
search
it
to
the
extremity
of
its
must
know
there
is
i
don
t
know
anything
of
the
sort
returned
carlyle
at
any
rate
we
shall
do
it
for
we
have
determined
upon
having
you
when
you
walk
into
west
lynne
you
ll
see
the
walks
alive
with
placards
carlyle
forever
suppose
you
allow
me
until
to
consider
of
it
and
defer
the
garnishing
of
the
walls
a
day
later
said
carlyle
a
serious
tone
peeping
out
in
the
midst
of
his
jocularity
you
do
not
fear
the
expenses
it
was
but
a
glance
he
returned
in
answer
as
soon
as
the
question
had
been
put
it
was
stupid
old
pinner
who
propounded
it
they
had
felt
how
foolish
it
was
and
indeed
the
cost
would
be
a
mere
nothing
were
there
no
opposition
come
decide
now
carlyle
give
us
your
if
i
decide
now
it
will
be
in
the
negative
replied
carlyle
it
is
a
question
that
demands
consideration
give
me
till
for
that
and
it
is
possible
that
i
may
accede
to
your
this
was
the
best
that
could
be
made
of
him
and
the
deputation
backed
out
and
as
nothing
more
could
be
done
departed
to
their
several
dill
who
had
been
present
remained
rubbing
his
hands
with
satisfaction
and
casting
admiring
glances
at
carlyle
what
s
the
matter
dill
asked
the
latter
you
look
as
though
you
were
pleased
at
this
movement
and
assumed
that
i
should
accept
and
so
you
will
archibald
and
as
to
the
looking
pleased
there
s
not
a
man
woman
or
child
in
west
lynne
who
won
t
do
don
t
make
too
sure
of
which
sir
of
your
becoming
our
member
or
of
the
people
looking
pleased
of
either
laughed
carlyle
he
quitted
the
office
to
walk
home
revolving
the
proposition
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
long
thought
of
some
time
entering
parliament
was
certain
though
no
definite
period
of
the
when
had
fixed
itself
in
his
mind
he
saw
not
why
he
should
confine
his
days
entirely
to
toil
to
the
work
of
his
calling
pecuniary
considerations
did
not
require
it
for
his
realized
property
combined
with
the
fortune
brought
by
barbara
was
quite
sufficient
to
meet
expenses
according
to
their
present
style
of
living
not
that
he
had
the
least
intention
of
giving
up
his
business
it
was
honorable
as
he
conducted
it
and
lucrative
and
he
really
liked
it
he
would
not
have
been
condemned
to
lead
an
idle
life
for
the
world
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
his
being
always
at
it
dill
made
as
good
a
principal
as
he
did
and
if
length
of
service
and
experience
might
be
counted
a
better
one
he
could
safely
be
left
to
manage
during
the
time
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
carlyle
to
be
in
london
he
would
rather
represent
west
lynne
than
any
other
spot
on
the
face
of
the
earth
no
matter
what
might
be
the
other
s
importance
and
as
west
lynne
was
now
in
want
of
a
member
perhaps
his
opportunity
had
come
that
he
would
make
a
good
and
efficient
public
servant
he
believed
his
talents
were
superior
his
oratory
persuasive
and
he
had
the
gift
of
a
true
and
honest
spirit
that
he
would
have
the
interest
of
west
lynne
at
heart
was
certain
and
he
knew
that
he
should
serve
his
constituents
to
the
very
best
of
his
power
and
ability
they
knew
it
also
before
carlyle
had
reached
east
lynne
he
had
decided
that
it
should
be
it
was
a
fine
spring
evening
the
lilac
was
in
bloom
the
hedges
and
trees
were
clothed
in
their
early
green
and
all
things
seemed
full
of
promise
even
carlyle
s
heart
was
rejoicing
in
the
prospect
opened
to
it
he
was
sure
he
should
like
a
public
life
but
in
the
sanguine
moments
of
realization
or
of
hope
some
dark
shade
will
step
in
to
mar
the
brightness
barbara
stood
at
the
window
watching
for
him
not
in
her
was
the
dark
shade
her
dress
was
a
marvel
of
vanity
and
prettiness
and
she
had
chosen
to
place
on
her
fair
hair
a
dainty
headdress
of
lace
as
if
her
hair
required
any
such
ornament
she
waltzed
up
to
carlyle
when
he
entered
and
saucily
held
up
her
face
the
light
of
love
dancing
in
her
bright
blue
eyes
what
do
you
want
he
provokingly
asked
putting
his
hands
behind
him
and
letting
her
stand
there
oh
well
if
you
won
t
say
to
me
i
have
a
great
mind
to
say
you
should
not
kiss
me
for
a
week
he
laughed
who
would
be
punished
by
that
whispered
he
barbara
pouted
her
pretty
lips
and
the
tears
positively
came
into
her
eyes
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
it
would
be
no
punishment
to
you
archibald
don
t
you
care
for
me
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
clasped
her
to
his
heart
taking
plenty
of
kisses
then
you
know
whether
i
care
not
he
fondly
whispered
but
now
will
you
believe
that
that
unfortunate
lady
isabel
had
been
a
witness
to
this
well
it
was
only
what
his
greeting
to
her
had
once
been
her
pale
face
flushed
scarlet
and
she
glided
out
of
the
room
again
as
softly
as
she
had
entered
it
they
had
not
seen
her
carlyle
drew
his
wife
to
the
window
and
stood
there
his
arms
round
her
waist
barbara
what
should
you
say
to
living
in
london
for
a
few
months
out
of
the
twelve
london
i
am
very
happy
where
i
am
why
should
you
ask
me
that
you
are
not
going
to
live
in
london
i
am
not
sure
of
that
i
think
i
am
for
a
portion
of
the
year
i
have
had
an
offer
made
me
this
afternoon
she
looked
at
him
wondering
what
he
meant
wondering
whether
he
was
serious
an
offer
what
sort
of
an
offer
of
what
nature
could
it
be
he
smiled
at
her
perplexity
should
you
like
to
see
attached
to
my
name
west
lynne
wants
me
to
become
its
a
pause
to
take
in
the
news
a
sudden
rush
of
color
and
then
she
gleefully
clasped
her
hands
round
his
arm
her
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
oh
archibald
how
glad
i
am
i
knew
how
you
were
appreciated
and
you
will
be
appreciated
more
and
more
this
is
right
it
was
not
well
for
you
to
remain
what
you
are
for
life
a
private
individual
a
country
i
am
perfectly
contented
with
my
lot
barbara
he
seriously
said
i
am
too
busy
to
be
i
know
that
were
you
but
a
laboring
man
toiling
daily
for
the
bread
you
eat
you
would
be
contented
feeling
that
you
were
fulfilling
your
appointed
duty
to
the
utmost
she
impulsively
said
but
archibald
can
you
not
still
be
a
busy
man
at
west
lynne
although
you
do
become
its
representative
if
i
could
not
i
should
never
accept
the
honor
barbara
for
some
few
months
of
the
year
i
must
of
necessity
be
in
town
but
dill
is
an
efficient
substitute
and
i
can
run
down
for
a
week
or
so
between
times
part
of
saturday
sunday
and
part
of
monday
i
can
always
pass
here
if
i
please
of
course
these
changes
have
their
drawbacks
as
well
as
their
where
would
be
the
drawbacks
in
this
she
interrupted
well
smiled
carlyle
in
the
first
place
i
suppose
you
could
not
always
be
with
her
hands
fell
her
color
faded
oh
archibald
if
i
do
become
their
member
i
must
go
up
to
town
as
soon
as
elected
and
i
don
t
think
it
will
do
for
my
little
wife
to
be
quitting
her
home
to
travel
about
just
barbara
s
face
wore
a
very
blank
look
she
could
not
dissent
from
carlyle
s
reasoning
and
you
must
remain
in
london
to
the
end
of
the
session
while
i
am
here
separated
archibald
she
passionately
added
while
the
tears
gushed
into
her
eyes
i
could
not
live
without
then
what
is
to
be
done
must
i
decline
it
decline
it
oh
of
course
not
i
know
we
are
looking
on
the
dark
side
of
things
i
can
go
very
well
with
you
for
a
month
perhaps
you
think
so
i
am
sure
so
and
mind
you
must
not
encourage
mamma
to
talk
me
out
of
it
archibald
she
continued
resting
her
head
upon
his
breast
her
sweet
face
turned
up
beseechingly
to
his
you
would
rather
have
me
with
you
would
you
not
he
bent
his
own
down
upon
it
what
do
you
think
about
it
my
darling
once
more
an
opportune
moment
for
her
to
enter
lady
isabel
barbara
heard
her
this
time
and
sprang
away
from
her
husband
carlyle
turned
round
at
the
movement
and
saw
madame
vine
she
came
forward
her
lips
ashy
her
voice
subdued
six
months
now
had
she
been
at
east
lynne
and
had
hitherto
escaped
detection
time
and
familiarity
render
us
accustomed
to
most
things
to
danger
among
the
rest
and
she
had
almost
ceased
to
fear
recognition
living
so
far
as
that
point
went
far
more
peaceably
than
she
had
done
at
first
she
and
the
children
were
upon
the
best
of
terms
she
had
greatly
endeared
herself
to
them
she
loved
them
and
they
loved
her
perhaps
nature
was
asserting
her
own
hidden
claims
she
felt
very
anxious
about
william
he
seemed
to
grow
weaker
and
she
determined
to
make
her
fears
known
to
carlyle
she
quitted
the
parlor
she
had
heard
carlyle
come
in
crossing
the
hall
she
tapped
softly
at
the
door
and
then
as
softly
entered
it
was
the
moment
of
carlyle
s
loud
greeting
to
his
wife
they
stood
together
heedless
of
her
gliding
out
again
she
paced
the
hall
her
hands
pressed
upon
her
beating
heart
how
dared
that
heart
rise
up
in
sharp
rebellion
at
these
witnessed
tokens
of
love
was
barbara
not
his
wife
had
she
not
a
legal
claim
to
all
his
tenderness
who
was
she
that
she
should
resent
them
in
her
jealousy
what
though
they
had
once
been
hers
hers
only
had
she
not
signed
and
sealed
her
own
forfeit
of
them
and
so
made
room
for
barbara
back
to
the
gray
parlor
there
she
stood
her
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
her
eyes
hidden
by
her
hand
thus
she
remained
for
some
minutes
and
lucy
thought
how
sad
she
looked
but
lucy
felt
hungry
and
was
casting
longing
glances
to
the
she
wondered
how
long
her
governess
meant
to
keep
it
waiting
madame
vine
cried
she
presently
don
t
you
know
that
tea
is
ready
this
caused
madame
vine
to
raise
her
eyes
they
fell
on
the
pale
boy
at
her
feet
she
made
no
immediate
answer
only
placed
her
hand
on
lucy
s
shoulder
oh
lucy
dear
i
i
have
many
sorrows
to
the
tea
will
warm
you
and
there
is
some
nice
jam
was
miss
lucy
s
offered
consolation
their
greeting
tender
as
it
may
be
is
surely
over
by
this
time
thought
lady
isabel
an
expression
something
like
mockery
curving
her
lips
i
will
venture
only
to
see
him
with
his
wife
s
face
on
his
breast
and
his
lips
bent
upon
it
but
they
had
heard
her
this
time
and
she
had
to
advance
in
spite
of
her
spirit
of
misery
and
her
whitened
features
would
you
be
so
good
sir
as
to
come
and
look
at
william
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
of
carlyle
what
for
interjected
barbara
he
looks
very
ill
i
do
not
like
his
looks
i
am
fearing
whether
he
can
be
worse
than
we
have
they
went
to
the
gray
parlor
all
three
of
them
carlyle
was
in
first
and
had
taken
a
long
silent
look
at
william
before
the
others
entered
what
is
he
doing
on
the
floor
exclaimed
barbara
in
her
astonishment
he
should
not
lie
on
the
floor
madame
he
lays
himself
down
there
at
the
dusk
hour
and
i
can
not
get
him
up
again
i
try
to
persuade
him
to
use
the
sofa
but
it
is
of
no
the
floor
will
not
hurt
him
said
carlyle
this
was
the
dark
shade
his
boy
s
failing
health
william
opened
his
eyes
who
s
that
papa
don
t
you
feel
well
william
oh
yes
i
m
very
well
but
i
am
why
do
you
lie
down
here
i
like
lying
here
papa
that
pretty
white
rabbit
of
mine
is
indeed
suppose
you
get
up
and
tell
me
all
about
i
don
t
know
about
it
myself
yet
said
william
softly
rising
the
gardener
told
lucy
when
she
was
out
just
now
i
did
not
go
i
was
tired
he
said
what
has
tired
you
interrupted
carlyle
taking
hold
of
the
boy
s
hand
oh
nothing
i
am
always
do
you
tell
wainwright
that
you
are
tired
no
why
should
i
tell
him
i
wish
he
would
not
order
me
to
take
that
nasty
medicine
that
cod
liver
but
it
is
to
make
you
strong
my
it
makes
me
sick
i
always
feel
sick
after
it
papa
madame
vine
says
i
ought
to
have
cream
that
would
be
cream
repeated
carlyle
turning
his
eyes
on
madame
vine
i
have
known
cream
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
in
a
case
like
william
s
she
observed
i
believe
that
no
better
medicine
can
be
given
that
it
has
in
fact
no
it
can
be
tried
said
carlyle
pray
give
your
orders
madame
vine
for
anything
you
think
may
be
beneficial
to
him
carlyle
added
you
have
had
more
experience
with
children
than
joyce
what
does
wainwright
say
interrupted
carlyle
speaking
to
his
wife
in
his
low
tone
i
do
not
always
see
him
when
he
comes
archibald
madame
vine
does
i
oh
dear
cried
lucy
can
t
we
have
tea
i
want
some
bread
and
carlyle
turned
round
smiled
and
nodded
at
her
patience
is
good
for
little
girls
miss
lucy
would
you
like
some
bread
and
jam
my
boy
william
shook
his
head
i
can
t
eat
jam
i
am
only
carlyle
cast
a
long
and
intent
look
at
him
and
then
left
the
room
lady
isabel
followed
him
her
thoughts
full
of
her
ailing
child
do
you
think
him
very
ill
sir
she
whispered
i
think
he
looks
so
what
does
wainwright
say
he
says
nothing
to
me
i
have
not
inquired
his
true
condition
until
it
did
not
come
to
me
that
there
was
any
does
he
look
so
much
worse
not
any
worse
than
customary
latterly
he
had
looked
just
like
this
in
the
evening
it
was
a
remark
of
hannah
s
that
roused
my
alarm
she
thinks
he
is
on
the
road
to
death
what
can
we
do
to
save
him
she
clasped
her
hands
as
she
spoke
in
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
she
almost
forgot
as
they
stood
there
together
talking
of
the
welfare
of
the
child
their
child
that
he
was
no
longer
her
husband
almost
not
quite
utterly
impossible
would
it
be
for
her
wholly
to
forget
the
dreadful
present
neither
he
nor
the
child
could
again
belong
to
her
in
this
world
a
strange
rising
of
the
throat
in
her
wild
despair
a
meek
courtesy
as
she
turned
from
him
his
last
words
ringing
in
her
ears
i
shall
call
in
further
advice
for
him
madame
william
was
clinging
round
carlyle
in
a
coaxing
attitude
when
she
the
gray
parlor
i
know
what
i
could
eat
mamma
if
you
d
let
me
have
it
cried
he
in
answer
to
her
remonstrance
that
he
must
eat
something
what
could
you
eat
some
cheese
cheese
with
tea
laughed
carlyle
for
the
last
week
or
two
he
has
fancied
strange
things
the
effect
of
a
diseased
appetite
exclaimed
madame
vine
but
if
i
allow
them
to
be
brought
in
he
barely
tastes
i
am
sure
mamma
i
could
eat
some
cheese
now
said
william
you
may
have
it
answered
carlyle
as
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
the
impatient
knock
and
ring
of
a
visitor
was
heard
barbara
wondered
who
could
be
arriving
at
that
their
dinner
hour
sailing
majestically
into
the
hall
her
lips
compressed
her
aspect
threatening
came
miss
carlyle
now
it
turned
out
that
miss
corny
had
been
standing
at
her
own
window
grimly
eyeing
the
ill
doings
of
the
street
from
the
fine
housemaid
opposite
who
was
enjoying
a
flirting
interview
with
the
baker
to
the
ragged
urchins
in
the
gutter
and
the
dust
and
there
she
caught
sight
of
the
string
justices
and
others
who
came
flowing
out
of
the
office
of
carlyle
so
many
of
them
were
they
that
miss
corny
involuntarily
thought
of
a
conjuror
flinging
flowers
out
of
a
hat
the
faster
they
come
the
more
it
seems
there
are
to
come
what
on
earth
is
up
cried
miss
corny
pressing
her
nose
flat
against
the
pane
that
she
might
see
better
they
filed
off
some
one
way
some
another
miss
carlyle
s
curiosity
was
keener
than
her
appetite
for
she
stayed
on
the
watch
although
just
informed
that
her
dinner
was
served
presently
carlyle
appeared
and
she
knocked
at
the
window
with
her
knuckles
he
did
not
hear
it
he
had
turned
off
at
a
quick
pace
toward
home
miss
corny
s
temper
rose
the
clerks
came
out
next
one
after
another
and
the
last
was
dill
he
was
less
hurried
than
carlyle
had
been
and
heard
miss
corny
s
signal
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
all
that
stream
of
people
want
at
the
office
began
she
when
dill
had
entered
in
obedience
to
it
that
was
the
deputation
miss
what
deputation
the
deputation
to
archibald
they
want
him
to
become
their
new
member
of
what
cried
she
not
guessing
at
the
actual
meaning
of
parliament
miss
corny
to
replace
attley
the
gentlemen
came
to
solicit
him
to
be
put
in
solicit
a
donkey
irascibly
uttered
miss
corny
for
the
tidings
did
not
meet
her
approbation
did
archibald
turn
them
out
again
he
gave
them
no
direct
answer
ma
am
he
will
consider
of
it
between
now
and
consider
of
it
shrieked
she
why
he
d
never
never
be
such
a
flat
as
to
comply
he
go
into
parliament
what
next
why
should
he
not
miss
corny
i
m
sure
i
should
be
proud
to
see
him
miss
corny
gave
a
sniff
you
are
proud
of
things
more
odd
than
even
john
dill
remember
that
fine
shirt
front
what
has
become
of
it
is
it
laid
up
in
lavender
not
exactly
in
lavender
miss
corny
it
lies
in
the
drawer
for
i
have
never
liked
to
put
it
on
since
after
what
you
why
don
t
you
sell
it
at
and
buy
a
couple
of
good
useful
ones
with
the
money
returned
she
tartly
better
that
than
keep
the
foppish
thing
as
a
witness
of
your
folly
perhaps
he
ll
be
buying
embroidered
fronts
next
if
he
goes
into
that
idle
house
of
commons
i
d
rather
enter
myself
for
six
months
at
the
oh
miss
corny
i
don
t
think
you
have
well
considered
it
it
s
a
great
honor
and
worthy
of
him
he
will
be
elevated
above
us
all
as
it
were
and
he
deserves
to
elevate
him
on
a
weathercock
raged
miss
corny
there
you
may
go
i
ve
heard
quite
brushing
past
the
old
gentleman
leaving
him
to
depart
or
not
as
he
might
please
miss
carlyle
strode
upstairs
flung
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
strode
down
again
her
servant
looked
considerably
surprised
and
addressed
her
as
she
crossed
the
hall
your
dinner
ma
am
he
ventured
to
say
what
s
my
dinner
to
you
returned
miss
corny
in
her
wrath
you
have
had
away
she
strode
and
thus
it
happened
that
she
was
at
east
lynne
almost
as
soon
as
carlyle
where
s
archibald
began
she
without
ceremony
the
moment
she
saw
barbara
he
is
here
is
anything
the
matter
carlyle
hearing
the
voice
came
out
and
she
pounced
upon
him
with
her
tongue
what
s
this
about
your
becoming
the
new
member
for
west
lynne
west
lynne
wishes
it
said
carlyle
sit
down
sit
down
yourself
retorted
she
keeping
on
her
feet
i
want
my
question
answered
of
course
you
will
decline
on
the
contrary
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
miss
corny
untied
the
strings
of
her
bonnet
and
flung
them
behind
her
have
you
counted
the
cost
she
asked
and
there
was
something
quite
sepulchral
in
her
solemn
tone
i
have
given
it
consideration
cornelia
both
as
regards
money
and
time
the
expenses
are
not
worth
naming
should
there
be
no
opposition
and
if
there
is
any
ay
groaned
miss
corny
if
there
is
well
i
am
not
without
a
few
hundred
to
spare
for
the
playing
he
said
turning
upon
her
the
light
of
his
fine
countenance
miss
carlyle
emitted
some
dismal
groans
that
ever
i
should
have
lived
to
see
this
day
to
hear
money
talked
of
as
though
it
were
dirt
and
what
s
to
become
of
your
business
she
sharply
added
is
that
to
be
let
run
to
rack
and
ruin
while
you
are
kicking
up
your
heels
in
that
wicked
london
under
plea
of
being
at
the
house
night
after
night
cornelia
he
gravely
said
were
i
dead
dill
could
carry
on
the
business
just
as
well
as
it
is
being
carried
on
now
i
might
go
into
a
foreign
country
for
seven
years
and
come
back
to
find
the
business
as
flourishing
as
ever
for
dill
could
keep
it
together
and
even
were
the
business
to
drop
off
though
i
tell
you
it
will
not
do
so
i
am
independent
of
miss
carlyle
faced
tartly
round
upon
barbara
have
you
been
setting
him
on
to
this
i
think
he
had
made
up
his
mind
before
he
spoke
to
me
but
added
barbara
in
her
truth
i
urged
him
to
accept
oh
you
did
nicely
moped
and
miserable
you
ll
be
here
if
he
goes
to
london
for
months
on
the
stretch
you
did
not
think
of
that
but
he
would
not
leave
me
here
said
barbara
her
eyelashes
becoming
wet
at
the
thought
as
she
unconsciously
moved
to
her
husband
s
side
he
would
take
me
with
miss
carlyle
made
a
pause
and
looked
at
them
alternately
is
that
decided
she
asked
of
course
it
is
laughed
carlyle
willing
to
joke
the
subject
and
his
sister
into
would
you
wish
to
separate
man
and
wife
cornelia
she
made
no
reply
she
rapidly
tied
her
the
ribbons
trembling
ominously
in
her
fingers
you
are
not
going
cornelia
you
must
stay
to
dinner
now
that
you
are
here
it
is
ready
and
we
will
talk
this
further
over
this
has
been
dinner
enough
for
me
for
one
day
spoke
she
putting
on
her
gloves
that
i
should
have
lived
to
see
my
father
s
son
throw
up
his
business
and
change
himself
into
a
lazy
parliament
man
do
stay
and
dine
with
us
cornelia
i
think
i
can
subdue
your
prejudices
if
you
will
let
me
talk
to
if
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
it
why
did
you
not
come
in
when
you
left
the
office
cried
miss
corny
in
a
greater
amount
of
wrath
than
she
had
shown
yet
and
there
s
no
doubt
that
in
his
not
having
done
so
lay
one
of
the
sore
points
i
did
not
think
of
it
said
carlyle
i
should
have
come
in
and
told
you
of
it
i
dare
say
you
would
she
ironically
answered
good
evening
to
you
and
in
spite
of
their
persuasions
she
quitted
the
house
and
went
stalking
down
the
avenue
two
or
three
days
more
and
the
address
of
carlyle
to
the
inhabitants
of
west
lynne
appeared
in
the
local
papers
while
the
walls
and
posts
convenient
were
embellished
with
various
colored
placards
vote
for
carlyle
forever
wonders
never
cease
surprises
are
the
lot
of
man
but
perhaps
a
greater
surprise
had
never
been
experienced
by
those
who
knew
what
was
what
than
when
it
went
forth
to
the
world
that
sir
francis
levison
had
converted
himself
from
from
what
he
was
into
a
politician
had
he
been
offered
the
post
of
prime
minister
or
did
his
conscience
smite
him
as
was
the
case
with
a
certain
gallant
captain
renowned
in
song
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
the
simple
fact
was
that
sir
francis
levison
was
in
a
state
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
and
required
something
to
prop
him
up
some
snug
sinecure
plenty
to
get
and
nothing
to
do
patch
himself
up
he
must
but
how
he
had
tried
the
tables
but
luck
was
against
him
he
made
a
desperate
venture
upon
the
turf
a
grand
coup
that
would
have
set
him
on
his
legs
for
some
time
but
the
venture
turned
out
the
wrong
way
and
sir
francis
was
a
defaulter
he
began
then
to
think
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
drop
into
some
nice
government
nest
where
as
i
have
told
you
there
would
be
plenty
to
get
and
nothing
to
do
any
place
with
much
to
do
would
not
suit
him
or
he
it
he
was
too
for
work
requiring
talent
you
may
have
remarked
that
a
man
given
to
sir
francis
levison
s
pursuits
generally
is
he
dropped
into
something
good
or
that
promised
good
nothing
less
than
the
secretaryship
to
lord
headthelot
who
swayed
the
ministers
in
the
upper
house
but
that
he
was
a
connection
of
lord
headthelot
s
he
never
would
have
obtained
it
and
very
dubiously
the
minister
consented
to
try
him
of
course
a
condition
was
that
he
should
enter
parliament
the
first
opportunity
his
vote
to
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
ministry
rather
a
shaky
ministry
and
supposed
by
some
to
be
on
its
last
legs
and
this
brings
us
to
the
present
time
in
a
handsome
in
eaton
square
one
sunny
afternoon
sat
a
lady
young
and
handsome
her
eyes
were
of
violet
blue
her
hair
was
auburn
her
complexion
delicate
but
there
was
a
stern
look
of
anger
amounting
to
sullenness
on
her
features
and
her
pretty
foot
was
beating
the
carpet
in
passionate
impatience
it
was
lady
levison
the
doings
of
the
past
had
been
coming
home
to
her
for
some
time
now
past
doings
be
they
good
or
be
they
ill
are
sure
to
come
home
one
day
or
another
and
bring
their
fruits
with
them
in
the
years
past
many
years
past
now
francis
levison
had
lost
his
heart
or
whatever
the
thing
might
be
that
with
him
did
duty
for
one
to
blanche
challoner
he
had
despised
her
once
to
lady
isabel
as
lord
thomas
says
in
the
old
ballad
but
that
was
done
to
suit
his
own
purpose
for
he
had
never
at
any
period
cared
for
lady
isabel
as
he
had
cared
for
blanche
he
gained
her
affection
in
secret
they
engaged
themselves
to
each
other
blanche
s
sister
lydia
challoner
two
years
older
than
herself
suspected
it
and
taxed
blanche
with
it
blanche
true
to
her
compact
of
keeping
it
a
secret
denied
it
with
many
protestations
she
did
not
care
for
captain
levison
rather
disliked
him
in
so
much
the
better
was
miss
challoner
s
reply
for
she
had
no
respect
for
captain
levison
and
deemed
him
an
unlikely
man
to
marry
years
went
on
and
poor
unhappy
blanche
challoner
remained
faithful
to
her
love
he
played
fast
and
loose
with
her
professing
attachment
for
her
in
secret
and
visiting
at
the
house
perhaps
he
feared
an
outbreak
from
her
an
exposure
that
might
be
anything
but
pleasant
did
he
throw
off
all
relations
between
them
blanche
summoned
up
her
courage
and
spoke
to
him
urging
the
marriage
she
had
not
yet
glanced
at
the
fear
that
his
intention
of
marrying
her
had
he
ever
possessed
such
was
over
bad
men
are
always
cowards
sir
francis
shrank
from
an
explanation
and
so
far
forgot
honor
as
to
murmur
some
indistinct
promise
that
the
wedding
should
be
speedy
lydia
challoner
had
married
and
been
left
a
widow
well
off
she
was
waring
and
at
her
house
resided
blanche
for
the
girls
were
orphans
blanche
was
beginning
to
show
symptoms
of
her
nearly
thirty
years
not
the
years
but
the
disappointment
the
burnings
were
telling
upon
her
her
hair
was
thin
her
face
was
pinched
her
form
had
lost
its
roundness
marry
her
indeed
scoffed
to
himself
sir
francis
levison
there
came
to
waring
s
upon
a
christmas
visit
a
younger
sister
alice
challoner
a
fair
girl
of
twenty
years
she
resided
generally
with
an
aunt
in
the
country
far
more
beautiful
was
she
than
blanche
had
ever
been
and
francis
levison
who
had
not
seen
her
since
she
was
a
child
fell
as
he
would
have
called
it
in
love
with
her
love
he
became
her
shadow
he
whispered
sweet
words
in
her
ear
he
turned
her
head
giddy
with
its
own
vanity
and
he
offered
her
marriage
she
accepted
him
and
preparations
for
the
ceremony
immediately
began
sir
francis
urged
speed
and
alice
was
nothing
loth
and
what
of
blanche
blanche
was
stunned
a
despairing
stupor
took
possession
of
her
and
when
she
woke
from
it
desperation
set
in
she
insisted
upon
an
interview
with
sir
francis
and
evade
it
he
could
not
though
he
tried
hard
will
it
be
believed
that
he
denied
the
past
that
he
met
with
mocking
suavity
her
indignant
reminders
of
what
had
been
between
them
love
marriage
nonsense
her
fancy
had
been
too
much
at
finally
he
defied
her
to
prove
that
he
had
regarded
her
with
more
than
ordinary
friendship
or
had
ever
hinted
at
such
a
thing
as
a
union
she
could
not
prove
it
she
had
not
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
paper
written
on
by
him
she
had
not
a
single
friend
or
enemy
to
come
forward
and
testify
that
they
heard
him
breathe
to
her
a
word
of
love
he
had
been
too
wary
for
that
moreover
there
was
her
own
solemn
protestations
to
her
sister
lydia
that
there
was
not
anything
between
her
and
francis
levison
who
would
believe
her
if
she
veered
round
now
and
avowed
these
protestations
were
false
no
she
found
that
she
was
in
a
sinking
ship
one
there
was
no
chance
of
saving
but
one
chance
did
she
determine
to
try
an
appeal
to
alice
blanche
challoner
s
eyes
were
suddenly
and
rudely
opened
to
the
badness
of
the
man
and
she
was
aware
now
how
thoroughly
unfit
he
was
to
become
the
husband
of
her
sister
it
struck
her
that
only
misery
could
result
from
the
union
and
that
if
possible
alice
should
be
saved
from
entering
upon
it
would
she
have
married
him
herself
then
yes
but
it
was
a
different
thing
for
that
fair
fresh
young
alice
she
had
not
wasted
her
life
s
best
years
in
waiting
for
him
when
the
family
had
gone
to
rest
and
the
house
was
quiet
blanche
challoner
proceeded
to
her
sister
s
bedroom
alice
had
not
begun
to
undress
she
was
sitting
in
a
comfortable
chair
before
the
fire
her
feet
on
the
fender
reading
a
love
letter
from
sir
francis
alice
i
am
come
to
tell
you
a
story
she
said
quietly
will
you
hear
it
in
a
minute
stop
a
bit
replied
alice
she
finished
the
perusal
of
the
letter
put
it
aside
and
then
spoke
again
what
did
you
say
blanche
a
story
blanche
nodded
several
years
ago
there
was
a
fair
young
girl
none
too
rich
in
our
station
of
life
a
gentleman
who
was
none
too
rich
either
sought
and
gained
her
love
he
could
not
marry
he
was
not
rich
i
say
they
loved
on
in
secret
hoping
for
better
times
she
wearing
out
her
years
and
her
heart
oh
alice
i
can
not
describe
to
you
how
she
loved
him
how
she
has
continued
to
love
him
up
to
this
moment
through
evil
report
she
clung
to
him
tenaciously
and
tenderly
as
the
vine
clings
to
its
trellis
for
the
world
spoke
ill
of
who
was
the
young
lady
interrupted
alice
is
this
a
fable
of
romance
blanche
or
a
real
history
a
real
history
i
knew
her
all
those
years
years
and
years
i
say
he
kept
leading
her
on
to
love
letting
her
think
that
his
love
was
hers
in
the
course
of
time
he
succeeded
to
a
fortune
and
the
bar
to
their
marriage
was
over
he
was
abroad
when
he
came
into
it
but
returned
home
at
once
their
intercourse
was
renewed
and
her
fading
heart
woke
up
once
more
to
life
still
the
marriage
did
not
come
on
he
said
nothing
of
it
and
she
spoke
to
him
very
soon
now
should
it
be
was
his
answer
and
she
continued
to
live
on
in
go
on
blanche
cried
alice
who
had
grown
interested
in
the
tale
never
suspecting
that
it
could
bear
a
personal
interest
yes
i
will
go
on
would
you
believe
alice
that
almost
immediately
after
this
last
promise
he
saw
one
whom
he
fancied
he
should
like
better
and
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
forsaking
the
one
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
every
tie
of
honor
repudiating
all
that
had
been
between
them
even
his
own
words
and
promises
how
disgraceful
were
they
married
they
are
to
be
would
you
have
such
a
man
i
returned
alice
quite
indignant
at
the
question
it
is
not
likely
that
i
that
man
alice
is
sir
francis
alice
challoner
gave
a
start
and
her
face
became
scarlet
how
dare
you
say
so
blanche
it
is
not
true
who
was
the
girl
pray
she
must
have
traduced
she
has
not
traduced
him
was
the
subdued
answer
the
girl
was
an
awkward
pause
i
know
cried
alice
throwing
back
her
head
resentfully
he
told
me
i
might
expect
something
of
this
that
you
had
fancied
him
in
love
with
you
and
were
angry
because
he
had
chosen
blanche
turned
upon
her
with
streaming
eyes
she
could
no
longer
control
her
emotion
alice
my
sister
all
the
pride
is
gone
out
of
me
all
the
reticence
that
woman
loves
to
observe
as
to
her
wrongs
and
her
inward
feelings
i
have
broken
through
for
you
this
night
as
sure
as
there
is
a
heaven
above
us
i
have
told
you
the
truth
until
you
came
i
was
engaged
to
francis
an
unnatural
scene
ensued
blanche
provoked
at
alice
s
rejection
of
her
words
told
all
the
ill
she
knew
or
heard
of
the
man
she
dwelt
upon
his
conduct
with
regard
to
lady
isabel
carlyle
his
heartless
treatment
of
that
unhappy
lady
alice
was
passionate
and
fiery
she
professed
not
to
believe
a
word
of
her
sister
s
wrongs
and
as
to
the
other
stories
they
were
no
affairs
of
hers
she
said
what
had
she
to
do
with
his
past
life
but
alice
challoner
did
believe
her
sister
s
earnestness
and
distress
as
she
told
the
tale
carried
conviction
with
them
she
did
not
very
much
care
for
sir
francis
he
was
not
entwined
round
her
heart
as
he
was
round
blanche
s
but
she
was
dazzled
with
the
prospect
of
so
good
a
settlement
in
life
and
she
would
not
give
him
up
if
blanche
broke
her
heart
why
she
must
break
it
but
she
need
not
have
mixed
taunts
and
jeers
with
her
refusal
to
believe
she
need
not
have
triumphed
openly
over
blanche
was
it
well
done
was
it
the
work
of
an
affectionate
sister
as
we
sow
so
shall
we
reap
she
married
sir
francis
levison
leaving
blanche
to
her
broken
heart
or
to
any
other
calamity
that
might
grow
out
of
the
injustice
and
there
sat
lady
levison
now
her
three
years
of
marriage
having
served
to
turn
her
love
for
sir
francis
into
contempt
and
hate
a
little
boy
two
years
old
the
only
child
of
the
marriage
was
playing
about
the
room
his
mother
took
no
notice
of
him
she
was
buried
in
absorbing
thought
thought
which
caused
her
lips
to
contract
and
her
brow
to
scowl
sir
francis
entered
his
attitude
lounging
his
air
listless
lady
levison
roused
herself
but
no
pleasant
manner
of
tone
was
hers
as
she
set
herself
to
address
him
i
want
some
money
she
said
so
do
i
he
answered
an
impatient
stamp
of
the
foot
and
a
haughty
toss
and
i
must
have
it
i
must
i
told
you
yesterday
that
i
must
do
you
suppose
i
can
go
on
without
a
sixpence
of
ready
money
day
after
day
do
you
suppose
it
is
of
any
use
to
put
yourself
in
this
fury
retorted
sir
francis
a
dozen
times
a
week
do
you
bother
me
for
money
and
a
dozen
times
do
i
tell
you
i
have
got
none
i
have
got
none
for
myself
you
may
as
well
ask
that
baby
for
money
as
ask
i
wish
he
had
never
been
born
passionately
uttered
lady
levison
unless
he
had
had
a
different
that
the
last
sentence
and
the
bitter
scorn
of
its
tone
would
have
provoked
a
reprisal
from
sir
francis
his
flashing
countenance
betrayed
but
at
that
moment
a
servant
entered
the
room
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
that
man
brown
forced
his
way
into
the
hall
and
i
can
t
see
him
i
won
t
see
him
interrupted
sir
francis
backing
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
in
what
looked
very
like
abject
terror
as
if
he
had
completely
lost
his
presence
of
mind
lady
levison
s
lips
curled
we
got
rid
of
him
sir
after
a
dreadful
deal
of
trouble
i
was
about
to
say
but
while
the
door
was
open
in
the
dispute
meredith
entered
he
has
gone
into
the
library
sir
and
vows
he
won
t
stir
till
he
sees
you
whether
you
are
sick
or
a
moment
s
pause
a
oath
and
the
sir
francis
quitted
the
room
the
servant
retired
and
lady
levison
caught
up
her
child
oh
franky
dear
she
wailed
forth
burying
her
face
in
his
warm
neck
i
d
leave
him
for
good
and
all
if
i
dared
but
i
fear
he
might
keep
now
the
secret
was
that
for
the
last
three
days
sir
francis
had
been
desperately
ill
obliged
to
keep
his
bed
and
could
see
nobody
his
life
depending
upon
quiet
such
was
the
report
or
something
equivalent
to
it
which
had
gone
in
to
lord
headthelot
or
rather
to
the
official
office
for
that
renowned
chief
was
himself
out
of
town
it
had
also
been
delivered
to
all
callers
at
sir
francis
levison
s
house
the
royal
truth
being
that
sir
francis
was
as
well
as
you
or
i
but
from
something
that
had
transpired
touching
one
of
his
numerous
debts
did
not
dare
to
show
himself
that
morning
the
matter
had
been
arranged
patched
up
for
a
time
my
stars
levison
began
meredith
who
was
a
of
the
ministry
what
a
row
there
is
about
you
why
you
look
as
well
as
ever
you
a
great
deal
better
coughed
sir
francis
to
think
that
you
should
have
chosen
the
present
moment
for
skulking
here
have
i
been
dancing
attendance
at
your
door
day
after
day
in
a
state
of
incipient
fever
enough
to
put
me
into
a
real
one
and
could
neither
get
admitted
nor
a
letter
taken
up
i
should
have
blown
the
house
up
and
got
in
amidst
the
flying
debris
by
the
way
are
you
and
my
lady
two
just
now
two
growled
sir
francis
she
was
stepping
into
her
carriage
yesterday
when
they
turned
me
from
the
door
and
i
made
inquiry
of
her
her
ladyship
s
answer
was
that
she
knew
nothing
either
of
francis
or
his
her
ladyship
is
subject
to
flights
of
distemper
chafed
sir
francis
what
desperate
need
have
you
of
me
just
now
headthelot
s
away
and
there
s
nothing
nothing
doing
up
here
a
deal
too
much
doing
somewhere
else
attley
s
seat
s
in
the
well
and
you
ought
to
have
been
down
there
about
it
three
or
four
days
ago
of
course
you
must
step
into
of
course
i
shan
t
returned
sir
francis
to
represent
west
lynne
will
not
suit
not
suit
you
west
lynne
why
of
all
places
it
is
most
suitable
it
s
close
to
your
own
if
you
call
ten
miles
close
i
shall
not
put
up
for
west
lynne
headthelot
came
up
this
morning
said
meredith
the
information
somewhat
aroused
sir
francis
headthelot
what
brings
him
back
you
i
tell
you
levison
there
s
a
hot
row
headthelot
expected
you
would
be
at
west
lynne
days
past
and
he
has
come
up
in
an
awful
rage
every
additional
vote
we
can
count
in
the
house
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
and
you
he
says
are
allowing
west
lynne
to
slip
through
your
fingers
you
must
start
for
it
at
once
sir
francis
mused
had
the
alternative
been
given
him
he
would
have
preferred
to
represent
a
certain
warm
place
underground
rather
than
west
lynne
but
to
quit
headthelot
and
the
snug
post
he
anticipated
would
be
ruin
irretrievable
nothing
short
of
outlawry
or
the
queen
s
prison
it
was
awfully
necessary
to
get
his
threatened
person
into
parliament
and
he
began
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
whether
he
could
bring
himself
to
make
further
acquaintance
with
west
lynne
the
thing
must
have
blown
over
for
good
by
this
time
was
the
result
of
his
cogitations
unconsciously
speaking
aloud
i
can
understand
your
reluctance
to
appear
at
west
lynne
cried
meredith
the
scene
unless
i
mistake
of
that
notorious
affair
of
yours
but
private
feelings
must
give
way
to
public
interests
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
start
headthelot
is
angry
enough
as
it
is
he
says
had
you
been
down
at
first
as
you
ought
to
have
been
you
would
have
slipped
in
without
opposition
but
now
there
will
be
a
sir
francis
looked
up
sharply
a
contest
who
is
going
to
stand
the
funds
pshaw
as
if
we
should
let
funds
be
any
barrier
have
you
heard
who
is
in
the
field
no
was
the
apathetic
answer
carlyle
uttered
sir
francis
startled
oh
by
george
though
i
can
t
stand
against
well
there
s
the
alternative
if
you
can
t
thornton
i
should
run
no
chance
west
lynne
would
not
elect
me
in
preference
to
him
i
m
not
sure
indeed
that
west
lynne
would
have
me
in
any
nonsense
you
know
our
interest
there
government
put
in
attley
and
it
can
put
you
in
yes
or
no
levison
yes
answered
sir
francis
an
hour
s
time
and
sir
francis
levison
went
forth
on
his
way
to
be
conveyed
to
west
lynne
not
yet
he
turned
his
steps
to
scotland
yard
in
considerably
less
than
an
hour
the
following
telegram
marked
secret
went
down
from
the
head
office
to
the

otway
bethel

a
mishap
to
the
blue
spectacles
carlyle
and
barbara
were
seated
at
breakfast
when
somewhat
to
their
surprise
dill
was
shown
in
following
close
upon
his
heels
came
justice
hare
and
close
upon
his
heels
came
squire
pinner
while
bringing
up
the
rear
was
colonel
bethel
all
the
four
had
come
up
separately
not
together
and
all
four
were
out
of
breath
as
if
it
had
been
a
race
which
should
arrive
soonest
quite
impossible
was
it
for
carlyle
at
first
to
understand
the
news
they
brought
all
were
talking
at
once
in
the
utmost
excitement
and
the
fury
of
justice
hare
alone
was
sufficient
to
produce
temporary
deafness
carlyle
caught
a
word
of
the
case
presently
a
second
man
opposition
well
let
him
come
on
he
cried
we
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
ascertaining
who
wins
in
the
but
you
have
not
heard
who
it
is
archibald
cried
old
dill
it
stand
a
contest
with
him
raved
justice
hare
he
the
fellow
wants
hanging
interjected
colonel
bethel
couldn
t
he
be
ducked
suggested
squire
pinner
now
all
these
sentences
were
ranted
out
together
and
their
respective
utterers
were
fain
to
stop
till
the
noise
subsided
a
little
barbara
could
only
look
from
one
to
the
other
in
astonishment
who
is
this
formidable
opponent
asked
carlyle
there
was
a
pause
not
one
of
them
but
had
the
delicacy
to
shrink
from
naming
that
man
to
carlyle
the
information
came
at
last
from
old
dill
who
dropped
his
voice
while
he
spoke
it
mr
archibald
the
candidate
who
has
come
forward
is
that
man
of
course
carlyle
you
ll
go
into
it
now
neck
and
crop
cried
justice
hare
carlyle
was
silent
you
won
t
let
the
beast
frighten
you
from
the
contest
uttered
colonel
bethel
in
a
loud
tone
there
s
a
meeting
at
the
buck
s
head
at
ten
said
carlyle
not
replying
to
the
immediate
question
i
will
be
with
you
did
you
not
say
dill
that
was
where
the
scoundrel
levison
is
at
the
buck
s
head
he
was
there
answered
dill
i
expect
he
is
ousted
by
this
time
i
asked
the
landlord
what
he
thought
of
himself
for
taking
in
such
a
character
and
what
he
supposed
the
justice
would
say
to
him
he
vowed
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
the
fellow
should
not
be
there
another
hour
and
that
he
should
never
have
entered
it
had
he
known
who
he
a
little
more
conversation
and
the
visitors
filed
off
carlyle
sat
down
calmly
to
finish
his
breakfast
barbara
approached
him
archibald
you
will
not
suffer
this
man
s
insolent
doings
to
deter
you
from
your
plans
you
will
not
withdraw
she
whispered
i
think
not
barbara
he
has
thrust
himself
offensively
upon
me
in
this
measure
i
believe
my
better
plan
will
be
to
take
no
more
heed
of
him
than
i
should
of
the
dirt
under
my
right
right
she
answered
a
proud
flush
deepening
the
rose
on
her
cheeks
carlyle
was
walking
into
west
lynne
there
were
the
placards
sure
enough
side
by
side
with
his
own
bearing
the
name
of
that
wicked
coward
who
had
done
him
the
greatest
injury
one
man
can
do
to
another
verily
he
must
possess
a
face
of
brass
to
venture
there
archibald
have
you
heard
the
disgraceful
news
the
speaker
was
miss
carlyle
who
had
come
down
upon
her
brother
like
a
ship
with
all
sails
set
her
cheeks
wore
a
flush
her
eyes
glistened
her
tall
form
was
drawn
up
to
its
most
haughty
height
i
have
heard
it
cornelia
and
had
i
not
the
walls
would
have
enlightened
is
he
out
of
his
mind
out
of
his
reckoning
i
fancy
replied
carlyle
you
will
carry
on
the
contest
now
she
continued
her
countenance
flashing
i
was
averse
to
it
before
but
i
now
withdraw
all
my
objection
you
will
be
no
brother
of
mine
if
you
yield
the
field
to
i
do
not
intend
to
yield
good
you
bear
on
upon
your
course
and
let
him
crawl
on
upon
his
take
no
more
heed
of
him
than
if
he
were
a
viper
archibald
you
must
canvass
no
said
carlyle
i
shall
be
elected
without
canvass
you
ll
see
there
will
be
plenty
canvassing
for
you
if
you
don
t
condescend
to
take
the
trouble
my
indifferent
brother
i
ll
give
a
thousand
pounds
myself
for
ale
to
the
take

laughed
carlyle
keep
your
thousand
pounds
in
your
pocket
cornelia
i
have
no
mind
to
be
unseated
on
the
plea
of
bribery
and
here
s
sir
john
dobede
galloping
in
with
a
face
as
red
as
the
sun
in
a
well
it
may
be
he
has
heard
the
news
i
can
tell
you
archibald
west
lynne
is
in
a
state
of
excitement
that
has
not
been
its
lot
for
many
a
miss
carlyle
was
right
excitement
and
indignation
had
taken
possession
of
west
lynne
how
the
people
rallied
around
carlyle
town
and
country
were
alike
up
in
arms
but
government
interest
was
rife
at
west
lynne
and
whatever
the
private
and
public
feeling
might
be
collectively
or
individually
many
votes
should
be
recorded
for
sir
francis
levison
one
of
the
first
to
become
cognizant
of
the
affair
was
lord
mount
severn
he
was
at
his
club
one
evening
in
london
poring
over
an
evening
paper
when
the
names
carlyle
west
lynne
caught
his
view
knowing
that
carlyle
had
been
named
as
the
probable
member
and
heartily
wishing
that
he
might
become
such
the
earl
naturally
read
the
paragraph
he
read
it
and
read
it
again
he
rubbed
his
eyes
he
rubbed
his
glasses
he
pinched
himself
to
see
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
for
believe
what
that
paper
asserted
that
sir
francis
levison
had
entered
the
lists
in
opposition
to
carlyle
and
was
at
west
lynne
busily
canvassing
he
could
not
do
you
know
anything
of
this
infamous
assertion
he
inquired
of
an
intimate
friend
infamous
whether
true
or
it
s
true
i
heard
of
it
an
hour
ago
plenty
of
cheek
that
levison
must
cheek
repeated
the
dismayed
earl
feeling
as
if
every
part
of
him
body
and
mind
were
outraged
by
the
news
don
t
speak
of
it
in
that
way
the
hound
deserves
to
be
he
threw
aside
the
paper
quitted
the
club
returned
home
for
a
carpet
bag
and
went
shrieking
and
whistling
down
to
west
lynne
taking
his
son
with
him
or
if
he
did
not
whistle
and
shriek
the
engine
did
fully
determined
was
the
earl
of
mount
severn
to
show
his
opinion
of
the
affair
on
these
fine
spring
mornings
their
breakfast
over
lady
isabel
was
in
the
habit
of
going
into
the
grounds
with
the
children
they
were
on
the
lawn
before
the
house
when
two
gentlemen
came
walking
up
the
avenue
or
rather
one
gentleman
and
a
handsome
young
stripling
growing
into
another
lady
isabel
thought
she
should
have
dropped
for
she
stood
face
to
face
with
lord
mount
severn
the
earl
stopped
to
salute
the
children
and
raised
his
hat
to
the
strange
lady
it
is
my
governess
madame
vine
said
lucy
a
silent
courtesy
from
madame
vine
she
turned
away
her
head
and
gasped
for
breath
is
your
papa
at
home
lucy
cried
the
earl
yes
i
think
he
is
at
breakfast
i
m
so
glad
you
are
come
lord
mount
severn
walked
on
holding
william
by
the
hand
who
had
eagerly
offered
to
take
him
to
papa
lord
vane
bent
over
lucy
to
kiss
her
a
little
while
a
very
few
more
years
and
my
young
lady
would
not
hold
up
her
rosy
lips
so
boldly
you
have
grown
a
dearer
girl
than
ever
lucy
have
you
forgotten
our
compact
no
laughed
she
and
you
will
not
forget
it
never
said
the
child
shaking
her
head
you
shall
see
if
i
lucy
is
to
be
my
wife
cried
he
turning
to
madame
vine
it
is
a
bargain
and
we
have
both
promised
i
mean
to
wait
for
her
till
she
is
old
enough
i
like
her
better
than
anybody
else
in
the
and
i
like
him
spoke
up
miss
lucy
and
it
s
all
lucy
was
a
child
it
may
almost
be
said
an
infant
and
the
viscount
was
not
of
an
age
to
render
important
such
avowed
passions
nevertheless
the
words
did
thrill
through
the
veins
of
the
hearer
she
spoke
she
thought
not
as
madame
vine
would
have
spoken
and
thought
but
as
the
unhappy
mother
the
lady
isabel
you
must
not
say
these
things
to
lucy
it
could
never
lord
vane
laughed
why
asked
he
your
father
and
mother
would
not
my
father
would
i
know
he
would
he
likes
lucy
as
to
my
mother
oh
well
she
can
t
expect
to
be
master
and
mistress
too
you
be
off
for
a
minute
lucy
i
want
to
say
some
thing
to
madame
vine
has
carlyle
shot
that
fellow
he
continued
as
lucy
sprung
away
my
father
is
so
stiff
especially
when
he
s
put
up
that
he
would
not
sully
his
lips
with
the
name
or
make
a
single
inquiry
when
we
arrived
neither
would
he
let
me
and
i
walked
up
here
with
my
tongue
she
would
have
responded
what
fellow
but
she
suspected
too
well
and
the
words
died
away
on
her
unwilling
lips
that
brute
levison
if
carlyle
riddled
his
body
with
shots
for
this
move
and
then
kicked
him
till
he
died
he
d
only
get
his
deserts
and
the
world
would
applaud
he
oppose
carlyle
i
wish
i
had
been
a
man
a
few
years
ago
he
d
have
got
a
shot
through
his
heart
then
i
say
dropping
his
voice
did
you
know
lady
isabel
yes
no
she
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
almost
as
unconscious
what
she
did
say
she
was
lucy
s
mother
you
know
and
i
loved
her
i
think
that
s
why
i
love
lucy
for
she
is
the
very
image
of
her
where
did
you
know
her
here
i
knew
her
by
hearsay
murmured
lady
isabel
arousing
to
recollection
oh
hearsay
has
carlyle
shot
the
beast
or
is
he
on
his
legs
yet
by
jove
to
think
that
he
should
sneak
himself
up
in
this
way
at
west
lynne
you
must
apply
elsewhere
for
information
she
gasped
i
know
nothing
of
these
she
turned
away
with
a
beating
heart
and
took
lucy
s
hand
and
departed
lord
vane
set
off
on
a
run
toward
the
house
his
heels
flying
behind
him
and
now
the
contest
began
in
earnest
that
is
the
canvass
sir
francis
levison
his
agent
and
a
friend
from
town
who
as
it
turned
out
instead
of
being
some
great
gun
of
the
government
was
a
private
chum
of
the
baronet
s
by
name
drake
sneaked
about
the
town
like
dogs
with
their
tails
burnt
for
they
were
entirely
alive
to
the
color
in
which
they
were
held
their
only
attendants
being
a
few
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
rags
who
commonly
brought
up
the
rear
the
other
party
presented
a
stately
crowd
county
gentry
magistrates
lord
mount
severn
sometimes
carlyle
would
be
with
them
with
the
latter
if
the
contesting
groups
came
within
view
of
each
other
and
were
likely
to
meet
the
brave
sir
francis
would
disappear
down
an
entry
behind
a
hedge
any
place
convenient
with
all
his
face
of
brass
he
could
not
meet
carlyle
and
that
condemning
jury
around
him
one
afternoon
it
pleased
carlyle
to
summon
lucy
and
the
governess
to
accompany
her
into
west
lynne
she
was
going
shopping
lady
isabel
had
a
dread
and
horror
of
appearing
in
there
while
that
man
was
in
town
but
she
could
not
help
herself
there
was
no
pleading
illness
for
she
was
quite
well
there
must
be
no
saying
i
will
not
go
for
she
was
only
a
dependant
they
started
and
had
walked
as
far
as
hare
s
gate
when
miss
carlyle
turned
out
of
it
your
mamma
s
not
well
is
she
not
cried
barbara
with
quick
concern
i
must
go
and
see
she
has
had
one
of
those
ridiculous
dreams
again
pursued
miss
carlyle
ignoring
the
presence
of
the
governess
and
lucy
i
was
sure
of
it
by
her
very
look
when
i
got
in
shivering
and
shaking
and
glancing
fearfully
around
as
if
she
feared
a
dozen
spectres
were
about
to
burst
out
of
the
walls
so
i
taxed
her
with
it
and
she
could
make
no
denial
richard
is
in
some
jeopardy
she
protests
or
will
be
and
there
she
is
shaking
still
although
i
told
her
that
people
who
put
faith
in
dreams
were
only
fit
for
a
lunatic
barbara
looked
distressed
she
did
not
believe
in
dreams
any
more
than
miss
carlyle
but
she
could
not
forget
how
strangely
peril
to
richard
had
supervened
upon
some
of
these
dreams
i
will
go
in
now
and
see
mamma
she
said
if
you
are
returning
home
cornelia
madame
vine
can
walk
with
you
and
wait
for
me
let
me
go
in
with
you
mamma
pleaded
lucy
barbara
mechanically
took
the
child
s
hand
the
gates
closed
on
them
and
miss
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
town
but
not
far
had
they
gone
when
in
turning
a
corner
the
wind
which
was
high
blew
away
with
the
veil
of
lady
isabel
and
in
raising
her
hand
in
trepidation
to
save
it
before
it
was
finally
gone
she
contrived
to
knock
off
her
blue
spectacles
they
fell
to
the
ground
and
were
broken
how
did
you
manage
that
uttered
miss
carlyle
how
indeed
she
bent
her
face
on
the
ground
looking
at
the
damage
what
should
she
do
the
veil
was
over
the
hedge
the
spectacles
were
broken
how
could
she
dare
show
her
naked
face
that
face
was
rosy
just
then
as
in
former
days
the
eyes
were
bright
and
miss
carlyle
caught
their
expression
and
stared
in
very
amazement
good
heavens
above
she
uttered
what
an
extraordinary
likeness
and
lady
isabel
s
heart
turned
faint
and
sick
within
her
well
it
might
and
to
make
matters
worse
bearing
down
right
upon
them
but
a
few
paces
distant
came
sir
francis
levison
would
he
recognize
her
standing
blowing
in
the
wind
at
the
turning
of
the
road
were
miss
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
vane
the
latter
confused
and
perplexed
was
picking
up
the
remnant
of
her
damaged
spectacles
the
former
little
less
perplexed
gazed
at
the
face
which
struck
upon
her
memory
as
being
so
familiar
her
attention
however
was
called
off
the
face
to
the
apparition
of
sir
francis
levison
he
was
close
upon
them
drake
and
the
other
comrade
being
with
him
and
some
tagrag
in
attendance
as
usual
it
was
the
first
time
he
and
miss
carlyle
had
met
face
to
face
she
bent
her
condemning
brow
haughty
in
its
bitter
scorn
full
upon
him
for
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
miss
carlyle
to
conceal
her
sentiments
especially
when
they
were
rather
of
the
strongest
sir
francis
when
he
arrived
opposite
raised
his
hat
to
her
whether
it
was
done
in
courtesy
in
confused
unconsciousness
or
in
mockery
can
not
be
told
miss
carlyle
assumed
it
to
have
been
the
latter
and
her
lips
in
their
anger
grew
almost
as
pale
as
those
of
the
unhappy
woman
who
was
cowering
behind
her
did
you
intend
that
insult
for
me
francis
levison
as
you
please
to
take
it
returned
he
calling
up
insolence
to
his
aid
you
dare
to
lift
off
your
hat
to
me
have
you
forgotten
that
i
am
miss
carlyle
it
would
be
difficult
for
you
to
be
forgotten
once
now
this
answer
was
given
in
mockery
his
tone
and
manner
were
redolent
of
it
insolently
so
the
two
gentlemen
looked
on
in
discomfort
wondering
what
it
meant
lady
isabel
hid
her
face
as
best
she
could
terrified
to
death
lest
his
eyes
should
fall
on
it
while
the
spectators
several
of
whom
had
collected
now
listened
with
interest
especially
some
farm
laborers
of
squire
pinner
s
who
had
happened
to
be
passing
you
contemptible
worm
cried
miss
carlyle
do
you
think
you
can
outrage
me
with
impunity
as
you
by
your
presence
in
it
are
outraging
west
lynne
out
upon
you
for
a
bold
bad
man
now
miss
corny
in
so
speaking
had
certainly
no
thought
of
present
and
immediate
punishment
for
the
gentleman
but
it
appeared
that
the
mob
around
had
the
motion
was
commented
by
those
laborers
whether
excited
thereto
by
the
words
of
miss
carlyle
who
whatever
may
have
been
her
faults
of
manner
held
the
respect
of
the
neighborhood
and
was
looked
up
to
only
in
a
less
degree
than
her
brother
whether
squire
pinner
their
master
had
let
drop
in
their
hearing
a
word
of
the
ducking
he
had
hinted
at
when
at
east
lynne
or
whether
their
own
feelings
alone
spurred
them
on
was
best
known
to
the
men
themselves
certain
it
is
that
the
ominous
sound
of
duck
him
was
breathed
forth
by
a
voice
and
it
was
caught
up
and
echoed
around
duck
him
duck
him
the
pond
be
close
at
hand
let
s
give
him
a
taste
of
his
deservings
what
do
he
the
scum
turn
himself
up
at
west
lynne
for
bearding
carlyle
what
have
he
done
with
lady
isabel
him
put
up
for
others
at
west
lynne
west
lynne
s
respectable
it
don
t
want
him
it
have
got
a
better
man
it
won
t
have
a
villain
now
lads
his
face
turned
white
and
he
trembled
in
his
shoes
worthless
men
are
frequently
cowards
lady
isabel
trembled
in
hers
and
well
she
might
hearing
that
one
allusion
they
set
upon
him
twenty
pairs
of
hands
at
least
strong
rough
determined
hands
not
to
speak
of
the
tagrag
s
help
who
went
in
with
cuffs
and
kicks
and
pokes
and
taunts
and
cheers
and
a
demoniac
dance
they
dragged
him
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
a
gap
that
no
baby
could
have
got
through
in
a
cool
moment
but
most
of
us
know
the
difference
between
coolness
and
excitement
the
hedge
was
extensively
damaged
but
justice
hare
to
whom
it
belonged
would
forgive
that
drake
and
the
lawyer
for
the
other
was
a
lawyer
were
utterly
powerless
to
stop
the
catastrophe
if
they
didn
t
mind
their
own
business
and
keep
themselves
clear
they
d
get
served
the
same
was
the
promise
held
out
in
reply
to
their
remonstrances
and
the
lawyer
who
was
short
and
fat
and
could
not
have
knocked
a
man
down
had
it
been
to
save
his
life
backed
out
of
the
melee
and
contented
himself
with
issuing
forth
confused
threatenings
of
the
terrors
of
the
law
miss
carlyle
stood
her
ground
majestically
and
looked
on
with
a
grim
countenance
had
she
interfered
for
his
protection
she
could
not
have
been
heard
and
if
she
could
have
been
there
s
no
knowing
whether
she
would
have
done
it
on
to
the
brink
of
the
pond
a
green
dank
dark
slimy
sour
stinking
pond
his
were
gone
by
this
time
and
sundry
rents
and
damages
appeared
in
in
another
useful
garment
one
pulled
him
another
pushed
him
a
third
shook
him
by
the
collar
half
a
dozen
buffeted
him
and
all
abused
him
in
with
him
boys
mercy
mercy
shrieked
the
victim
his
knees
bending
and
his
teeth
chattering
a
little
mercy
for
the
love
of
heaven
heaven
much
he
knows
of
heaven
a
souse
a
splash
a
wild
cry
a
gurgle
and
sir
francis
levison
was
floundering
in
the
water
its
green
poison
not
to
mention
its
adders
and
toads
and
frogs
going
down
his
throat
by
bucketfuls
a
hoarse
derisive
laugh
and
a
hip
hip
hurrah
broke
from
the
actors
while
the
juvenile
ragtag
in
wild
delight
joined
their
hands
round
the
pool
and
danced
the
demon
s
dance
like
so
many
red
indians
they
had
never
had
such
a
play
acted
for
them
before
out
of
the
before
he
was
quite
dead
quite
senseless
of
all
drowned
rats
he
looked
the
worst
as
he
stood
there
with
his
white
rueful
face
his
shivery
limbs
and
his
dilapidated
garments
shaking
the
wet
off
him
the
laborers
their
duty
done
walked
coolly
away
the
tagrag
withdrew
to
a
safe
distance
waiting
for
what
might
come
next
and
miss
carlyle
moved
away
also
not
more
shivery
was
that
wretched
man
than
lady
isabel
as
she
walked
by
her
side
a
sorry
figure
to
cut
that
for
her
once
chosen
cavalier
what
did
she
think
of
his
beauty
now
i
know
what
she
thought
of
her
past
folly
miss
carlyle
never
spoke
a
word
she
sailed
on
with
her
head
up
though
it
was
turned
occasionally
to
look
at
the
face
of
madame
vine
at
the
deep
distressing
blush
which
this
gaze
called
into
her
cheeks
it
s
very
odd
thought
miss
corny
the
likeness
especially
in
the
eyes
is
where
are
you
going
madame
they
were
passing
a
spectacle
shop
and
madame
vine
had
halted
at
the
door
one
foot
on
its
step
i
must
have
my
glasses
to
be
mended
if
you
miss
carlyle
followed
her
in
she
pointed
out
what
she
wanted
done
to
the
old
glasses
and
said
she
would
buy
a
pair
of
new
ones
to
wear
while
the
job
was
about
the
man
had
no
blue
ones
no
green
plenty
of
white
one
ugly
old
pair
of
green
things
he
had
with
rims
left
by
some
stranger
ages
and
ages
ago
to
be
mended
and
never
called
for
again
this
very
pair
of
ugly
old
green
things
was
chosen
by
lady
isabel
she
put
them
on
there
and
then
miss
carlyle
s
eyes
searching
her
face
inquisitively
all
the
time
why
do
you
wear
glasses
began
miss
corny
abruptly
as
soon
as
they
were
indoors
another
deep
flush
and
an
imperceptible
hesitation
my
eyes
are
not
they
look
as
strong
as
eyes
can
look
but
why
wear
colored
glasses
white
ones
would
answer
every
purpose
i
should
i
am
accustomed
to
colored
ones
i
should
not
like
white
ones
miss
corny
paused
what
is
your
christian
name
madame
began
she
again
jane
replied
madame
popping
out
an
unflinching
story
in
her
alarm
here
here
what
s
up
what
s
this
it
was
a
crowd
in
the
street
and
rather
a
noisy
one
miss
corny
flew
to
the
window
lady
isabel
in
her
wake
two
crowds
it
may
almost
be
said
for
from
the
opposite
way
the
party
as
carlyle
s
was
called
in
allusion
to
his
colors
came
in
view
quite
a
collection
of
gentlemen
carlyle
and
lord
mount
severn
heading
them
what
could
it
mean
the
mob
they
were
encountering
the
yellow
party
doubtless
but
in
a
disreputable
condition
who
or
what
was
that
object
in
advance
of
it
supported
between
drake
and
the
lawyer
and
looking
like
a
drowned
rat
hair
hanging
legs
tottering
cheeks
shaking
and
clothes
in
tatters
while
the
mob
behind
had
swollen
to
the
length
of
the
street
and
was
keeping
up
a
perpetual
fire
of
derisive
shouts
groans
and
hisses
the
halted
in
consternation
and
lord
mount
severn
whose
sight
was
not
as
good
as
it
had
been
twenty
years
back
stuck
his
pendent
eye
glasses
astride
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
sir
francis
levison
could
it
be
yes
it
actually
was
what
on
earth
had
put
him
into
that
state
carlyle
s
lip
curled
he
continued
his
way
and
drew
the
peer
with
him
what
the
deuce
is
now
called
out
the
followers
of
carlyle
that
s
levison
has
he
been
in
a
railway
smash
and
got
drenched
by
the
engine
he
has
been
ducked
grinned
the
yellows
in
answer
they
have
been
and
ducked
him
in
the
rush
pool
on
justice
hare
s
the
soaked
and
miserable
man
increased
his
speed
as
much
as
his
cold
and
trembling
legs
would
allow
him
he
would
have
borne
on
without
legs
at
all
rather
than
remain
under
the
enemy
s
gaze
the
enemy
loftily
continued
their
way
their
heads
in
the
air
and
scorning
further
notice
all
save
young
lord
vane
he
hovered
round
the
ranks
of
the
unwashed
and
looked
vastly
inclined
to
enter
upon
an
indian
jig
on
his
own
account
what
a
thundering
ass
i
was
to
try
it
on
at
west
lynne
was
the
enraged
comment
of
the
sufferer
miss
carlyle
laid
her
hand
upon
the
shrinking
arm
of
her
pale
companion
you
see
him
my
brother
archibald
i
see
him
faltered
lady
isabel
and
you
see
him
that
pitiful
outcast
who
is
too
contemptible
to
live
look
at
the
two
and
contrast
them
look
yes
was
the
gaping
answer
the
woman
who
called
him
that
noble
man
husband
quitted
him
for
the
other
did
she
come
to
repentance
think
you
you
may
wonder
that
the
submerged
gentleman
should
be
walking
through
the
streets
on
his
way
to
his
quarters
the
raven
inn
for
he
had
been
ejected
from
the
buck
s
head
but
he
could
not
help
himself
as
he
was
dripping
and
swearing
on
the
brink
of
the
pond
wondering
how
he
should
get
to
the
raven
an
empty
fly
drove
past
and
drake
immediately
stopped
it
but
when
the
driver
saw
that
he
was
expected
to
convey
not
only
a
passenger
but
a
tolerable
quantity
of
water
as
well
and
that
the
passenger
moreover
was
sir
francis
levison
he
refused
the
job
his
fly
was
fresh
lined
with
red
velvet
and
he
weren
t
a
going
to
have
it
spoilt
he
called
out
as
he
whipped
his
horse
and
drove
away
leaving
the
three
in
wrathful
despair
sir
francis
wanted
another
conveyance
procured
his
friends
urged
that
if
he
waited
for
that
he
might
catch
his
death
and
that
the
shortest
way
would
be
to
hasten
to
the
inn
on
foot
he
objected
but
his
jaws
were
chattering
his
limbs
were
quaking
so
they
seized
him
between
them
and
made
off
but
never
bargained
for
the
meeting
of
carlyle
and
his
party
francis
levison
would
have
stopped
in
the
pond
of
his
own
accord
head
downward
rather
than
face
them
miss
carlyle
went
that
day
to
dine
at
east
lynne
walking
back
with
carlyle
madame
vine
and
lucy
lord
vane
found
them
out
and
returned
at
the
same
time
of
course
east
lynne
was
the
headquarters
of
himself
and
his
father
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
and
had
been
ever
since
the
encounter
with
the
yellows
you
d
have
gone
into
laughing
convulsions
lucy
had
you
seen
the
drowned
cur
i
d
give
all
my
tin
for
six
months
to
come
to
have
a
photograph
of
him
as
he
looked
then
lucy
laughed
in
glee
she
was
unconscious
poor
child
how
deeply
the
drowned
cur
had
injured
her
when
miss
carlyle
was
in
her
taking
her
things
off
the
room
where
once
had
slept
richard
hare
she
rang
for
joyce
these
two
rooms
were
still
kept
for
miss
carlyle
for
she
did
sometimes
visit
them
for
a
few
days
and
were
distinguished
by
her
name
miss
carlyle
s
a

a
chap

excited
peter
cried
echoed
miss
carlyle
well
ma
am
you
know
he
was
very
fond
of
lady
isabel
was
peter
and
somehow
his
feelings
overcame
him
he
said
he
had
not
heard
anything
to
please
him
so
much
for
many
a
day
and
with
that
he
burst
out
crying
and
gave
bill
white
half
a
crown
out
of
his
pocket
bill
white
said
it
was
he
who
held
one
leg
when
they
soused
him
in
afy
saw
it
if
you
ll
excuse
me
mentioning
her
name
to
you
ma
am
for
i

t
think
well
of
her
and
when
she
got
in
here
she
fell
into
how
did
she
see
it
snapped
miss
carlyle
her
equanimity
upset
by
the
sound
of
the
name
i
didn
t
see
her
and
i
was
she
was
coming
here
with
a
message
from
latimer
to
the
what
did
she
go
into
hysterics
for
again
snapped
miss
carlyle
it
upset
her
so
she
said
returned
joyce
it
wouldn
t
have
done
her
harm
had
they
ducked
her
too
was
the
angry
response
joyce
was
silent
to
contradict
miss
corny
brought
triumph
to
nobody
and
she
was
conscious
in
her
innermost
heart
that
afy
merited
a
little
wholesome
correction
not
perhaps
to
the
extent
of
a
ducking
joyce
resumed
miss
carlyle
abruptly
changing
the
subject
who
does
the
governess
put
you
in
mind
of
ma
am
repeated
joyce
in
some
surprise
as
it
appeared
the
governess
do
you
mean
madame
vine
do
i
mean
you
or
do
i
mean
me
are
we
governesses
irascibly
cried
miss
corny
who
should
i
mean
but
madame
vine
she
turned
herself
round
from
the
and
gazed
full
in
joyce
s
face
waiting
for
the
answer
joyce
lowered
her
voice
as
she
gave
it
there
are
times
when
she
puts
me
in
mind
of
my
late
lady
both
in
her
face
and
manner
but
i
have
never
said
so
ma
am
for
you
know
lady
isabel
s
name
must
be
an
interdicted
one
in
this
have
you
seen
her
without
her
glasses
no
never
said
joyce
i
did
returned
miss
carlyle
and
i
can
tell
you
joyce
that
i
was
confounded
at
the
likeness
it
is
an
extraordinary
likeness
one
would
think
it
was
a
ghost
of
lady
isabel
vane
come
into
the
world
that
evening
after
dinner
miss
carlyle
and
lord
mount
severn
sat
side
by
side
on
the
same
sofa
coffee
cups
in
hand
miss
carlyle
turned
to
the
earl
was
it
a
positively
ascertained
fact
that
lady
isabel
died
the
earl
stared
with
all
his
might
he
thought
it
the
strangest
question
that
ever
was
asked
him
i
scarcely
understand
you
miss
carlyle
died
certainly
she
when
the
result
of
the
accident
was
communicated
to
you
you
made
inquiry
yourself
into
its
truth
its
details
i
believe
it
was
my
duty
to
do
so
there
was
no
one
else
to
undertake
did
you
ascertain
positively
beyond
all
doubt
that
she
did
die
of
a
surety
i
did
she
died
in
the
course
of
the
same
night
terribly
injured
she
a
pause
miss
carlyle
was
ruminating
but
she
returned
to
the
charge
as
if
difficult
to
be
convinced
you
deem
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
an
error
you
are
sure
that
she
is
dead
i
am
as
sure
that
she
is
dead
as
that
we
are
living
decisively
replied
the
earl
and
he
spoke
but
according
to
his
belief
wherefore
should
you
be
inquiring
this
a
thought
came
over
me
only
to
wonder
whether
she
was
really
had
any
error
occurred
at
that
time
any
false
report
of
her
death
i
should
soon
have
found
it
out
by
her
drawing
the
annuity
i
settled
upon
her
it
has
never
been
drawn
since
besides
she
would
have
written
to
me
as
agreed
upon
no
poor
thing
she
is
gone
beyond
all
doubt
and
has
taken
her
sins
with
convincing
proofs
and
miss
carlyle
lent
her
ear
to
them
the
following
morning
while
madame
vine
was
at
breakfast
carlyle
entered
do
you
admit
intruders
here
madame
vine
cried
he
with
his
sweet
smile
and
attractive
manner
she
arose
her
face
burning
her
heart
throbbing
keep
your
seat
pray
i
have
but
a
moment
to
stay
said
carlyle
i
have
come
to
ask
you
how
william
seems
there
was
no
difference
she
murmured
and
then
she
took
courage
and
spoke
more
openly
i
understood
you
to
say
the
other
night
sir
that
he
should
have
further
ay
i
wish
him
to
go
over
to
lynneborough
to
martin
the
drive
i
think
will
do
him
good
replied
carlyle
and
i
would
like
you
to
accompany
him
if
you
do
not
mind
the
trouble
you
can
have
the
pony
carriage
it
will
be
better
to
go
in
that
than
boxed
up
in
the
railway
carriage
you
can
remind
martin
that
the
child
s
constitution
is
precisely
what
his
mother
s
was
continued
carlyle
a
tinge
lightening
his
face
it
may
be
a
guide
to
his
treatment
he
said
himself
it
was
when
he
attended
him
for
an
illness
a
year
or
two
yes
he
crossed
the
hall
on
his
entrance
to
the
she
tore
upstairs
to
her
chamber
and
sank
down
in
an
agony
of
tears
and
despair
oh
to
love
him
as
she
did
now
to
yearn
after
his
affection
with
this
passionate
jealous
longing
and
to
know
that
they
were
separated
for
ever
and
ever
that
she
was
worse
to
him
than
nothing
softly
my
lady
this
is
not
bearing

chapter
xxxvi
appearance
of
a
russian
bear
at
west
lynne
carlyle
harangued
the
populace
from
the
balcony
of
the
buck
s
head
a
substantial
old
house
renowned
in
the
days
of
posting
now
past
and
gone
its
balcony
was
an
roomy
balcony
painted
green
where
there
was
plenty
of
space
for
his
friends
to
congregate
he
was
a
persuasive
orator
winning
his
way
to
ears
and
hearts
but
had
he
spoken
with
plums
in
his
mouth
and
a
stammer
on
his
tongue
and
a
at
every
sentence
the
uproarious
applause
and
shouts
would
be
equally
rife
carlyle
was
intensely
popular
in
west
lynne
setting
aside
his
candidateship
and
his
oratory
and
west
lynne
made
common
cause
against
sir
francis
levison
sir
francis
levison
harangued
the
mob
from
the
raven
but
in
a
more
ignoble
manner
for
the
raven
possessed
no
balcony
and
he
was
fain
to
let
himself
down
with
a
stride
and
a
jump
from
the
first
floor
window
on
the
top
of
the
of
the
parlor
and
stand
there
the
raven
though
a
comfortable
old
established
and
respectable
inn
could
boast
only
of
casements
for
its
upper
windows
and
they
are
not
convenient
to
deliver
speeches
from
he
was
wont
therefore
to
take
his
seat
on
the
and
that
was
not
altogether
convenient
either
for
it
was
but
narrow
and
he
hardly
dared
move
an
arm
or
a
leg
for
fear
of
pitching
over
on
the
upturned
faces
drake
let
himself
down
also
to
support
him
on
one
side
and
the
first
day
the
lawyer
supported
him
on
the
other
for
the
first
day
only
for
that
worthy
being
not
as
high
as
sir
francis
levison
s
or
drake
s
shoulder
and
about
five
times
their
breadth
had
those
two
been
rolled
into
one
experienced
a
slight
difficulty
in
getting
back
again
it
was
accomplished
at
last
sir
francis
pulling
him
up
and
drake
hoisting
him
from
behind
just
as
a
ladder
was
being
brought
out
to
the
rescue
amidst
shouts
of
laughter
the
stout
man
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
when
he
was
landed
in
safety
and
recorded
a
mental
vow
never
to
descend
from
a
window
again
after
that
the
candidate
and
his
friend
shared
the
shelf
between
them
the
lawyer
s
name
was
rubiny
supposed
to
be
a
corruption
of
reuben
they
stood
there
one
afternoon
sir
francis
eloquence
in
full
play
but
he
was
a
shocking
speaker
and
the
crowd
laughing
hissing
groaning
and
applauding
blocking
up
the
road
sir
francis
could
not
complain
of
one
thing
that
he
got
no
audience
for
it
was
the
pleasure
of
west
lynne
extensively
to
support
him
in
that
respect
a
few
to
cheer
a
great
many
to
jeer
and
hiss
remarkably
dense
was
the
mob
on
this
afternoon
for
carlyle
had
just
concluded
his
address
from
the
buck
s
head
and
the
crowd
who
had
been
listening
to
him
came
rushing
up
to
swell
the
ranks
of
the
other
crowd
they
were
elbowing
and
pushing
and
treading
on
each
other
s
heels
when
an
open
barouche
drove
suddenly
up
to
scatter
them
its
horses
wore
scarlet
and
purple
rosettes
and
one
lady
a
very
pretty
one
sat
inside
of
it
carlyle
but
the
crowd
could
not
be
so
easily
scattered
it
was
too
thick
the
carriage
could
advance
but
at
a
snail
s
pace
and
now
and
then
came
to
a
standstill
also
till
the
confusion
should
be
subsided
for
where
was
the
use
of
wasting
words
he
did
not
bow
to
barbara
he
remembered
the
result
of
his
having
done
so
to
miss
carlyle
and
the
little
interlude
of
the
pond
had
washed
most
of
his
impudence
out
of
him
he
remained
at
his
post
not
looking
at
barbara
not
looking
at
anything
in
particular
waiting
till
the
interruption
should
have
passed
barbara
under
cover
of
her
dainty
lace
parasol
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
at
that
very
moment
he
raised
his
right
hand
slightly
shook
his
head
back
and
tossed
his
hair
off
his
brow
his
hand
ungloved
was
white
and
delicate
as
a
lady
s
and
his
rich
diamond
ring
gleamed
in
the
sun
the
pink
flush
on
barbara
s
cheek
deepened
to
a
crimson
damask
and
her
brow
contracted
with
a
remembrance
of
pain
the
very
action
richard
described
the
action
he
was
always
using
at
east
lynne
i
believe
from
my
heart
that
the
man
is
thorn
that
richard
was
laboring
under
some
mistake
when
he
said
he
knew
sir
francis
she
let
her
hands
fall
upon
her
knee
as
she
spoke
heedless
of
the
candidate
heedless
of
the
crowd
heedless
of
all
save
her
own
troubled
thoughts
a
hundred
respected
salutations
were
offered
her
she
answered
them
mechanically
a
shout
was
raised
long
live
carlyle
carlyle
forever
barbara
bowed
her
pretty
head
on
either
side
and
the
carriage
at
length
got
on
the
parting
of
the
crowd
brought
dill
who
had
come
to
listen
for
once
to
the
speech
of
the
second
man
and
ebenezer
james
close
to
each
other
ebenezer
james
was
one
who
for
the
last
twelve
or
fifteen
years
had
been
trying
his
hand
at
many
trades
and
had
not
come
out
particularly
well
at
any
a
rolling
stone
gathers
no
moss
first
he
had
been
clerk
to
carlyle
next
he
had
been
seduced
into
joining
the
corps
of
the
theatre
royal
at
lynneborough
then
he
turned
auctioneer
then
travelling
in
the
oil
and
color
line
then
a
parson
the
urgent
pastor
of
some
new
sect
then
omnibus
driver
then
collector
of
the
water
rate
and
now
he
was
clerk
again
not
in
carlyle
s
office
but
in
that
of
ball
treadman
other
solicitors
of
west
lynne
a
idle
chap
was
ebenezer
james
and
that
was
the
worst
that
could
be
urged
against
him
save
that
he
was
sometimes
out
at
pocket
and
out
at
elbows
his
father
was
a
respectable
man
and
had
made
money
in
trade
but
he
had
married
a
second
wife
had
a
second
family
and
his
eldest
son
did
not
come
in
for
much
of
the
paternal
money
though
he
did
for
a
large
share
of
the
paternal
anger
well
ebenezer
and
how
goes
the
world
with
you
cried
dill
by
way
of
salutation
jogging
on
it
never
gets
to
a
didn
t
i
see
you
turning
into
your
father
s
house
yesterday
i
pretty
soon
turned
out
of
it
again
i
m
like
the
monkey
when
i
venture
there
get
more
kicks
than
halfpence
hush
old
gentleman
we
interrupt
the
of
course
the
eloquence
applied
to
sir
francis
levison
and
they
set
themselves
to
listen
dill
with
a
serious
face
ebenezer
with
a
grinning
one
but
soon
a
jostle
and
movement
carried
them
to
the
outside
of
the
crowd
out
of
sight
of
the
speaker
though
not
entirely
out
of
hearing
by
these
means
they
had
a
view
of
the
street
and
discerned
something
advancing
to
them
which
they
took
for
a
russian
bear
on
its
hind
legs
i
ll
be
blest
uttered
ebenezer
james
after
a
prolonged
pause
of
staring
consternation
if
i
don
t
believe
it
s
bethel
bethel
repeated
dill
gazing
at
the
approaching
figure
what
has
he
been
doing
to
himself
otway
bethel
it
was
just
arrived
from
foreign
parts
in
his
travelling
costume
something
shaggy
terminating
all
over
with
tails
a
wild
object
he
looked
and
dill
rather
backed
as
he
drew
near
as
if
fearing
he
was
a
real
animal
which
might
bite
him
what
s
your
name
cried
he
it
used
to
be
bethel
replied
the
wild
man
holding
out
his
hand
to
dill
so
you
are
in
the
world
james
and
kicking
yet
and
hope
to
kick
in
it
for
some
time
to
come
replied
james
where
did
you
hail
from
last
a
settlement
at
the
north
pole
didn
t
get
quite
as
far
what
s
the
row
here
when
did
you
arrive
otway
inquired
old
dill
now
four
o
clock
train
i
say
what
s
up
an
election
that
s
all
said
ebenezer
attley
went
and
kicked
the
i
don
t
ask
about
the
election
i
heard
all
that
at
the
railway
station
returned
otway
bethel
impatiently
what
s
this
waving
his
hand
at
the
crowd
one
of
the
candidates
wasting
breath
and
words
i
say
repeated
otway
bethel
looking
at
dill
wasn
t
it
rather
rather
of
the
ratherest
for
him
to
oppose
carlyle
infamous
contemptible
was
the
old
gentleman
s
excited
answer
but
he
ll
get
his
deserts
yet
otway
they
have
already
begun
he
was
treated
to
a
ducking
yesterday
in
justice
hare
s
green
and
he
did
look
a
miserable
devil
when
he
came
out
trailing
through
the
streets
added
ebenezer
while
otway
bethel
burst
into
a
laugh
he
was
smothered
into
some
hot
blankets
at
the
raven
and
a
pint
of
burnt
brandy
put
into
him
he
seems
all
right
will
he
go
in
and
win
chut
win
against
carlyle
he
has
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
and
government
if
it
is
the
government
who
put
him
on
must
be
a
pack
of
fools
they
can
t
know
the
influence
of
carlyle
bethel
is
that
style
of
costume
the
fashion
where
you
come
from
for
slender
pockets
i
ll
sell
em
to
you
now
james
at
half
price
let
s
get
a
look
at
this
levison
though
i
have
never
seen
the
another
interruption
of
the
crowd
even
as
he
spoke
caused
by
the
railway
van
bringing
up
some
luggage
they
contrived
in
the
confusion
to
push
themselves
to
the
front
not
far
from
sir
francis
otway
bethel
stared
at
him
in
unqualified
amazement
why
what
brings
him
here
what
is
he
doing
who
he
pointed
his
finger
the
one
with
the
white
handkerchief
in
his
that
is
sir
no
uttered
bethel
a
whole
world
of
astounded
meaning
in
his
tone
by
jove
he
sir
francis
levison
at
that
moment
their
eyes
met
francis
levison
s
and
otway
bethel
s
otway
bethel
raised
his
shaggy
hat
in
salutation
and
sir
francis
appeared
completely
scared
only
for
an
instant
did
he
lose
his
presence
of
mind
the
next
his
eyeglass
was
stuck
in
his
eye
and
turned
on
bethel
with
a
hard
haughty
stare
as
much
as
to
say
who
are
you
fellow
that
you
should
take
such
a
liberty
but
his
cheeks
and
lips
were
growing
as
white
as
marble
do
you
know
levison
otway
inquired
old
dill
a
little
when
he
was
not
levison
but
somebody
else
laughed
ebenezer
james
eh
bethel
bethel
turned
as
reproving
a
stare
on
ebenezer
as
the
baronet
had
just
turned
on
him
what
do
you
mean
pray
mind
your
own
a
nod
to
old
dill
and
he
turned
off
and
disappeared
taking
no
further
notice
of
james
the
old
gentleman
questioned
the
latter
what
was
that
little
bit
of
ebenezer
nothing
much
laughed
ebenezer
only
he
nodding
towards
sir
francis
was
not
always
the
great
man
he
is
ah
i
have
held
my
tongue
about
it
for
it
s
no
affair
of
mine
but
i
don
t
mind
letting
you
into
the
secret
would
you
believe
that
that
grand
baronet
there
member
for
west
lynne
used
years
ago
to
dodge
about
abbey
wood
mad
after
afy
hallijohn
he
didn
t
call
himself
levison
dill
felt
as
if
a
hundred
pins
and
needles
were
pricking
at
his
memory
for
there
rose
up
in
it
certain
doubts
and
troubles
touching
richard
hare
and
one
thorn
he
laid
his
eager
hand
upon
the
other
s
arm
ebenezer
james
what
did
he
call
himself
thorn
a
dandy
then
as
he
is
now
he
used
to
come
galloping
down
the
swainson
road
at
dusk
tie
his
horse
in
the
woods
and
monopolize
miss
how
do
you
know
this
because
i
ve
seen
it
a
dozen
times
i
was
spooney
after
afy
myself
in
those
days
and
went
down
there
a
good
deal
in
an
evening
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
and
perhaps
that
murdering
villain
dick
hare
afy
would
have
listened
to
me
not
that
she
cared
for
dick
but
you
see
they
were
gentlemen
i
am
thankful
to
the
stars
now
for
my
luck
in
escaping
her
with
her
for
a
wife
i
should
have
been
in
a
pickle
always
as
it
is
i
do
get
out
of
it
once
in
a
did
you
know
then
that
he
was
francis
levison
not
i
he
called
himself
thorn
i
tell
you
when
he
came
down
to
offer
himself
for
member
and
oppose
carlyle
i
was
thunderstruck
like
bethel
was
a
minute
ago
ho
ho
said
i
so
thorn
s
defunct
and
levison
has
what
had
otway
bethel
to
do
with
him
nothing
that
i
know
of
only
bethel
was
fond
of
the
woods
also
after
other
game
than
afy
though
and
may
have
seen
thorn
often
you
saw
that
he
recognized
thorn
levison
i
mean
did
not
appear
to
like
the
recognition
said
dill
who
would
in
his
position
laughed
ebenezer
james
i
don
t
like
to
be
reminded
of
many
a
wild
scrape
of
my
past
life
in
my
poor
station
and
what
would
it
be
for
levison
were
it
to
come
out
that
he
once
called
himself
thorn
and
came
running
after
miss
afy
hallijohn
why
did
he
call
himself
thorn
why
disguise
his
own
name
not
knowing
can
t
say
is
his
name
levison
or
is
it
thorn
nonsense
ebenezer
dill
bursting
with
the
strange
news
he
had
heard
endeavored
to
force
his
way
through
the
crowd
that
he
might
communicate
it
to
carlyle
the
crowd
was
however
too
dense
for
him
and
he
had
to
wait
the
opportunity
of
escaping
with
what
patience
he
might
when
it
came
he
made
his
way
to
the
office
and
entered
carlyle
s
private
room
that
gentleman
was
seated
at
his
desk
signing
letters
why
dill
you
are
out
of
breath
well
i
may
be
archibald
i
have
been
listening
to
the
most
extraordinary
statement
i
have
found
out
about
thorn
who
do
you
think
he
is
carlyle
put
down
his
pen
and
looked
full
in
the
old
man
s
face
he
had
never
seen
him
so
excited
it
s
that
man
i
do
not
understand
you
said
carlyle
he
did
not
it
was
as
good
as
hebrew
to
him
the
levison
of
your
opponent
is
the
thorn
who
went
after
afy
hallijohn
it
is
so
it
can
not
be
slowly
uttered
carlyle
thought
upon
thought
working
havoc
with
his
brain
where
did
you
hear
this
dill
told
his
tale
otway
bethel
s
recognition
of
him
sir
francis
levison
s
scared
paleness
for
he
had
noticed
that
ebenezer
s
revelation
the
point
in
it
all
that
finally
settled
most
upon
carlyle
was
the
thought
that
if
levison
were
indeed
the
man
he
could
not
be
instrumental
in
bringing
him
to
justice
bethel
has
denied
to
me
more
than
once
that
he
knew
thorn
or
was
aware
of
such
a
man
being
in
existence
observed
carlyle
he
must
have
had
a
purpose
in
it
then
returned
dill
they
knew
each
other
levison
recognized
him
for
certain
although
he
carried
it
off
with
a
high
hand
pretending
and
it
was
not
as
levison
but
as
thorn
that
bethel
recognized
him
there
s
little
doubt
of
that
he
did
not
mention
the
name
thorn
but
he
was
evidently
struck
with
astonishment
at
hearing
that
it
was
levison
if
they
have
not
some
secret
between
them
archibald
i
ll
never
believe
my
own
eyes
mrs
hare
s
opinion
is
that
bethel
had
to
do
with
the
murder
said
carlyle
in
a
low
tone
if
that
is
their
secret
bethel
knows
the
murderer
rely
upon
it
was
the
answer
mr
archibald
it
seems
to
me
that
now
or
never
is
the
time
to
clear
up
aye
but
how
set
about
it
responded
carlyle
meanwhile
barbara
had
proceeded
home
in
her
carriage
her
brain
as
busy
as
carlyle
s
perhaps
more
troubled
her
springing
lightly
and
hastily
out
the
moment
it
stopped
disdaining
the
footman
s
arm
her
compressed
lips
and
absent
countenance
proved
that
her
resolution
was
set
upon
some
plan
of
action
william
and
madame
vine
met
her
in
the
hall
we
have
seen
martin
and
he
says
i
can
not
stay
to
hear
now
william
i
will
see
you
later
she
ran
upstairs
to
her
madame
vine
following
her
with
her
reproachful
eyes
why
should
she
care
thought
madame
it
is
not
her
throwing
her
parasol
on
one
chair
her
gloves
on
another
down
sat
barbara
to
her
i
will
write
to
him
i
will
have
him
here
if
it
be
but
for
an
hour
she
passionately
exclaimed
this
shall
be
so
far
cleared
up
i
am
as
sure
as
sure
can
be
that
it
is
that
man
the
very
action
richard
described
and
there
was
the
diamond
ring
for
better
for
worse
i
will
send
for
him
but
it
will
not
be
for
worse
if
god
is
with
she
dashed
off
a
letter
getting
up
ere
she
had
well
begun
it
to
order
her
carriage
round
again
she
would
trust
none
but
herself
to
put
it
in
the
post
my
dear
smith
we
want
you
here
something
has
arisen
that
it
is
necessary
to
see
you
upon
you
can
get
here
by
saturday
be
in
these
grounds
near
the
covered
walk
that
evening
at
dusk
ever
yours
and
the
letter
was
addressed
to
smith
of
some
street
in
liverpool
the
address
furnished
by
richard
very
cautious
to
see
was
barbara
she
even
put
mr
smith
inside
the
letter
now
stop
cried
barbara
to
herself
as
she
was
folding
it
i
ought
to
send
him
a
five
pound
note
for
he
may
not
have
the
means
to
come
and
i
don
t
think
i
have
one
of
that
amount
in
the
she
looked
in
her
secretaire
not
a
single
note
out
of
the
room
she
ran
meeting
joyce
who
was
coming
along
the
corridor
do
you
happen
to
have
a
note
joyce
no
ma
am
not
by
i
dare
say
madame
vine
has
i
paid
her
last
week
and
there
were
two
notes
amongst
and
away
went
barbara
to
the
gray
parlor
could
you
lend
me
a
note
madame
vine
i
have
occasion
to
enclose
one
in
a
letter
and
find
i
do
not
possess
madame
vine
went
to
her
room
to
get
it
barbara
waited
she
asked
william
what
martin
said
he
tried
my
chest
with
oh
i
forget
what
they
call
it
and
he
said
i
must
be
a
brave
boy
and
take
my
oil
well
and
port
wine
and
everything
i
liked
that
was
good
and
he
said
he
should
be
at
west
lynne
next
wednesday
afternoon
and
i
am
to
go
there
and
he
would
call
in
and
see
where
are
you
to
meet
him
he
said
either
at
papa
s
office
or
at
aunt
cornelia
s
as
we
might
decide
madame
fixed
it
for
papa
s
office
for
she
thought
he
might
like
to
see
martin
i
say
what
asked
barbara
madame
vine
has
been
crying
ever
since
why
should
she
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
crying
yes
but
she
wipes
her
eyes
under
her
spectacles
and
thinks
i
don
t
see
her
i
know
i
am
very
ill
but
why
should
she
cry
for
that
nonsense
william
who
told
you
you
were
very
ill
nobody
i
suppose
i
am
he
thoughtfully
added
if
joyce
or
lucy
cried
now
there
d
be
some
sense
in
it
for
they
have
known
me
all
my
you
are
so
apt
to
fancy
things
you
are
always
doing
it
it
is
not
likely
that
madame
would
be
crying
because
you
are
madame
came
in
with
the
barbara
thanked
her
ran
upstairs
and
in
another
minute
or
two
was
in
her
carriage
she
was
back
again
and
dressing
when
the
gentlemen
returned
to
dinner
carlyle
came
upstairs
barbara
like
most
persons
who
do
things
without
reflection
having
had
time
to
cool
down
from
her
ardor
was
doubting
whether
she
had
acted
wisely
in
sending
so
precipitately
for
richard
she
carried
her
doubt
and
care
to
her
husband
her
sure
refuge
in
perplexity
archibald
i
fear
i
have
done
a
foolish
he
laughed
i
fear
we
all
do
that
at
times
barbara
what
is
it
he
had
seated
himself
in
one
of
barbara
s
favorite
low
chairs
and
she
stood
before
him
leaning
on
his
shoulder
her
face
a
little
behind
so
that
he
could
not
see
it
in
her
delicacy
she
would
not
look
at
him
while
she
spoke
what
she
was
going
to
speak
it
is
something
that
i
have
had
upon
my
mind
for
years
and
i
did
not
like
to
tell
it
to
for
years
you
remember
that
night
years
ago
when
richard
was
at
the
grove
in
disguise
which
night
barbara
he
came
more
than
the
night
the
night
that
lady
isabel
quitted
east
lynne
she
answered
not
knowing
how
better
to
bring
it
to
his
recollection
and
she
stole
her
hand
lovingly
into
his
as
she
said
it
richard
came
back
after
his
departure
saying
he
had
met
thorn
in
bean
lane
he
described
the
peculiar
motion
of
the
hand
as
he
threw
back
his
hair
from
his
brow
he
spoke
of
the
white
hand
and
the
diamond
ring
how
it
glittered
in
the
moonlight
do
you
remember
i
the
motion
appeared
perfectly
familiar
to
me
for
i
had
seen
it
repeatedly
used
by
one
then
staying
at
east
lynne
i
wondered
you
did
not
recognize
it
from
that
night
i
had
little
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
thorn
i
believed
that
he
and
captain
levison
were
a
pause
why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
barbara
how
could
i
speak
of
that
man
to
you
at
that
time
afterwards
when
richard
was
here
that
snowy
winter
s
day
he
asserted
that
he
knew
sir
francis
levison
that
he
had
seen
him
and
thorn
together
and
that
put
me
off
the
scent
but
as
i
was
passing
the
raven
in
the
carriage
going
very
slow
on
account
of
the
crowd
he
was
perched
out
there
addressing
the
people
and
i
saw
the
very
same
action
the
old
action
that
i
had
used
to
barbara
paused
carlyle
did
not
interrupt
her
i
feel
a
conviction
that
they
are
the
same
that
richard
must
have
been
under
some
unaccountable
mistake
in
saying
that
he
knew
francis
levison
besides
who
but
he
in
evening
dress
would
have
been
likely
to
go
through
bean
lane
that
night
it
leads
to
no
houses
but
one
wishing
to
avoid
the
high
road
could
get
into
it
from
these
grounds
and
so
on
to
west
lynne
he
must
have
gone
back
directly
on
foot
to
west
lynne
to
get
the
post
carriage
as
was
proved
and
he
would
naturally
go
through
bean
lane
forgive
me
archibald
for
recalling
these
things
to
you
but
i
feel
so
sure
that
levison
and
thorn
are
i
know
they
are
he
quietly
said
barbara
in
her
astonishment
drew
back
and
stared
him
in
the
face
a
face
of
severe
dignity
it
was
just
then
oh
archibald
did
you
know
it
at
that
time
i
did
not
know
it
until
this
afternoon
i
never
suspected
i
wonder
you
did
not
i
have
wondered
so
do
i
now
dill
ebenezer
james
and
otway
bethel
who
came
home
day
were
standing
before
the
raven
listening
to
his
speech
when
bethel
recognized
him
not
as
levison
he
was
infinitely
astonished
to
find
he
was
levison
levison
they
say
was
scared
at
the
recognition
and
changed
color
bethel
would
give
no
explanation
and
moved
away
but
james
told
dill
that
levison
was
the
man
thorn
who
used
to
be
after
afy
how
did
you
know
breathlessly
asked
barbara
because
ebenezer
was
after
afy
himself
and
repeatedly
saw
thorn
in
the
wood
barbara
i
believe
now
that
it
was
levison
who
killed
hallijohn
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
bethel
had
to
do
with
barbara
clasped
her
hands
how
strange
it
is
she
exclaimed
in
some
excitement
mamma
told
me
yesterday
that
she
was
convinced
something
or
other
was
going
to
turn
up
relative
to
the
murder
she
had
had
the
most
distressing
dream
she
said
connected
with
richard
and
bethel
and
somebody
else
whom
she
appeared
to
know
in
the
dream
but
could
not
recognize
or
remember
when
she
was
awake
she
was
as
ill
as
could
be
she
does
put
such
faith
in
these
wretched
one
would
think
you
did
also
barbara
by
your
no
no
you
know
better
but
it
is
strange
you
must
acknowledge
that
it
is
that
so
sure
as
anything
fresh
happens
touching
the
subject
of
the
murder
so
sure
is
a
troubled
dream
the
forerunner
of
it
mamma
does
not
have
them
at
other
times
bethel
denied
to
you
that
he
knew
i
know
he
and
now
it
turns
out
that
he
does
know
him
and
he
is
always
in
mamma
s
dreams
none
more
prominent
in
them
than
bethel
but
archibald
i
am
not
telling
you
i
have
sent
for
you
have
i
felt
sure
that
levison
was
thorn
i
did
not
expect
that
others
would
recognize
him
and
i
acted
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
and
wrote
to
richard
telling
him
to
be
here
on
saturday
evening
the
letter
is
well
we
must
shelter
him
as
best
we
archibald
dear
archibald
what
can
be
done
to
clear
him
she
asked
the
tears
rising
to
her
eyes
being
levison
i
can
not
what
she
uttered
not
act
not
act
for
richard
he
bent
his
clear
truthful
eyes
upon
her
my
dearest
how
can
i
she
looked
a
little
rebellious
and
the
tears
fell
you
have
not
considered
barbara
any
one
in
the
world
but
levison
it
would
look
like
my
own
forgive
me
she
softly
whispered
you
are
always
right
i
did
not
think
of
it
in
that
light
but
what
steps
do
you
imagine
can
be
taken
it
is
a
case
encompassed
with
difficulties
mused
carlyle
let
us
wait
until
richard
do
you
happen
to
have
a
note
in
your
pocket
archibald
i
had
not
one
to
send
to
him
and
borrowed
it
from
madame
he
took
out
his
pocket
book
and
gave
it
to
her
in
the
gray
parlor
in
the
dark
twilight
of
the
april
evening
or
it
was
getting
far
into
the
night
were
william
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
it
had
been
a
warm
day
but
the
spring
evenings
were
still
chilly
and
a
fire
burned
in
the
grate
there
was
no
blaze
the
red
embers
were
smoldering
and
half
dead
but
madame
vine
did
not
bestir
herself
to
heed
the
fire
william
lay
on
the
sofa
and
she
sat
by
looking
at
him
her
glasses
were
off
for
the
tears
wetted
them
continually
and
it
was
not
the
recognition
of
the
children
she
feared
he
was
tired
with
the
drive
to
lynneborough
and
back
and
lay
with
eyes
shut
she
thought
asleep
presently
he
opened
them
how
long
will
it
be
before
i
die
the
words
took
her
utterly
by
surprise
and
her
heart
went
round
in
a
whirl
what
do
you
mean
william
who
said
anything
about
dying
oh
i
know
i
know
by
the
fuss
there
is
over
me
you
heard
what
hannah
said
the
other
what
when
when
she
brought
in
the
tea
and
i
was
lying
on
the
rug
i
was
not
asleep
though
you
thought
i
was
you
told
her
she
ought
to
be
more
cautious
for
that
i
might
not
have
been
i
don
t
remember
much
about
it
said
lady
isabel
at
her
wits
ends
how
to
remove
the
impression
hannah
s
words
must
have
created
had
he
indeed
heard
them
hannah
talks
great
nonsense
she
said
i
was
going
on
fast
to
the
did
she
nobody
attends
to
hannah
she
is
only
a
foolish
girl
we
shall
soon
have
you
well
when
the
warm
weather
madame
well
my
darling
where
s
the
use
of
your
trying
to
deceive
me
do
you
think
i
don
t
see
that
you
are
doing
it
i
m
not
a
baby
you
might
if
it
were
archibald
what
is
it
that
s
the
matter
with
me
nothing
only
you
are
not
strong
when
you
get
strong
again
you
will
be
as
well
as
william
shook
his
head
in
disbelief
he
was
precisely
that
sort
of
child
from
whom
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
disguise
facts
quick
thoughtful
observant
and
advanced
beyond
his
years
had
no
words
been
dropped
in
his
hearing
he
would
have
suspected
the
evil
by
the
care
evinced
for
him
but
plenty
of
words
had
been
dropped
hints
by
which
he
had
gathered
suspicion
broad
assertions
like
hannah
s
which
had
too
fully
supplied
it
and
the
boy
in
his
inmost
heart
knew
as
well
that
death
was
coming
for
him
as
that
death
itself
did
then
if
there
s
nothing
the
matter
with
me
why
could
not
martin
speak
to
you
before
me
why
did
he
send
me
into
the
other
room
while
he
told
you
what
he
thought
ah
madame
vine
i
am
as
wise
as
a
wise
little
boy
but
mistaken
sometimes
she
said
from
her
aching
heart
it
s
nothing
to
die
when
god
loves
us
lord
vane
says
so
he
had
a
little
brother
who
a
sickly
child
who
was
never
likely
to
live
he
had
been
pale
and
ailing
from
a
baby
spoke
lady
isabel
why
did
you
know
him
i
i
heard
so
she
replied
turning
off
her
thoughtless
avowal
in
the
best
manner
she
could
don
t
you
know
that
i
am
going
to
die
then
why
have
you
been
grieving
since
we
left
martin
s
and
why
do
you
grieve
at
all
for
me
i
am
not
your
the
words
the
scene
altogether
overcame
her
she
knelt
down
by
the
sofa
and
her
tears
burst
forth
freely
there
you
see
cried
william
oh
william
i
i
had
a
little
boy
of
my
own
and
when
i
look
at
you
i
think
of
him
and
that
is
why
i
i
know
you
have
told
us
of
him
before
his
name
was
william
she
leaned
over
him
her
breath
mingling
with
his
she
took
his
little
hand
in
hers
william
do
you
know
that
those
whom
god
loves
best
he
takes
first
were
you
to
die
you
would
go
to
heaven
leaving
all
the
cares
and
sorrows
of
the
world
behind
you
it
would
have
been
happier
for
many
of
us
had
we
died
in
would
it
have
been
happier
for
you
yes
she
faintly
said
i
have
had
more
than
my
share
of
sorrow
sometimes
i
think
that
i
can
not
support
is
it
not
past
then
do
you
have
sorrow
now
i
have
it
always
i
shall
have
it
till
i
die
had
i
died
a
child
william
i
should
have
escaped
it
oh
the
world
is
full
of
it
full
and
what
sort
of
sorrow
all
sorts
pain
sickness
care
trouble
sin
remorse
weariness
she
wailed
out
i
can
not
enumerate
the
half
that
the
world
brings
upon
us
when
you
are
very
very
tired
william
does
it
not
seem
a
luxury
a
sweet
happiness
to
lie
down
at
night
in
your
little
bed
waiting
for
the
bliss
of
sleep
yes
and
i
am
often
tired
so
tired
as
then
just
so
do
we
who
are
tired
of
the
world
s
cares
long
for
the
grave
in
which
we
shall
lie
down
to
rest
we
covet
it
william
long
for
it
but
you
can
not
understand
we
don
t
lie
in
the
grave
madame
no
no
child
our
bodies
lie
there
to
be
raised
again
in
beauty
at
the
last
day
we
go
into
a
blessed
place
of
rest
where
sorrow
and
pain
can
not
come
i
wish
i
wish
she
uttered
with
a
bursting
heart
that
you
and
i
were
both
there
who
says
the
world
s
so
sorrowful
madame
vine
i
think
it
is
lovely
especially
when
the
sun
s
shining
on
a
hot
day
and
the
butterflies
come
out
you
should
see
east
lynne
on
a
summer
s
morning
when
you
are
running
up
and
down
the
slopes
and
the
trees
are
waving
overhead
and
the
sky
s
blue
and
the
roses
and
flowers
are
all
out
you
would
not
call
it
a
sad
a
pleasant
world
one
might
regret
to
leave
if
we
were
not
wearied
by
pain
and
care
but
what
is
this
world
take
it
at
its
best
in
comparison
with
that
other
world
heaven
i
have
heard
of
some
people
who
are
afraid
of
death
they
fear
they
shall
not
go
to
it
but
when
god
takes
a
little
child
there
it
is
because
he
loves
him
it
is
a
land
as
barbauld
says
where
the
roses
are
without
thorns
where
the
flowers
are
not
mixed
with
brambles
i
have
seen
the
flowers
interrupted
william
rising
in
his
earnestness
they
are
ten
times
brighter
than
our
flowers
seen
the
flowers
the
flowers
we
shall
see
in
heaven
she
echoed
i
have
seen
a
picture
of
them
we
went
to
lynneborough
to
see
martin
s
picture
of
the
last
judgment
i
don
t
mean
martin
said
william
interrupting
himself
i
there
were
three
pictures
one
was
called
the
plains
of
heaven
and
i
liked
that
best
and
so
we
all
did
oh
you
should
have
seen
it
did
you
ever
see
them
madame
vine
no
i
have
heard
of
there
was
a
river
you
know
and
boats
beautiful
gondolas
they
looked
taking
the
redeemed
to
the
shores
of
heaven
they
were
shadowy
figures
in
white
robes
myriads
of
them
for
they
reached
all
up
in
the
air
to
the
holy
city
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
clouds
coming
down
from
god
the
flowers
grew
on
the
banks
of
the
river
pink
and
blue
and
violet
all
colors
they
were
but
so
bright
and
beautiful
brighter
than
our
flowers
who
took
you
to
see
the
pictures
papa
he
took
me
and
lucy
and
hare
went
with
us
and
barbara
she
was
not
our
mamma
then
but
madame
dropping
his
voice
what
stupid
thing
do
you
think
lucy
asked
papa
what
did
she
ask
him
she
asked
whether
mamma
was
amongst
that
crowd
in
the
white
robes
whether
she
was
gone
up
to
heaven
our
mamma
that
was
you
know
and
lots
of
people
could
hear
what
she
lady
isabel
dropped
her
face
upon
her
hands
what
did
your
papa
answer
she
breathed
i
don
t
know
nothing
i
think
he
was
talking
to
barbara
but
it
was
very
stupid
of
lucy
because
wilson
has
told
her
over
and
over
again
that
she
must
never
talk
of
lady
isabel
to
papa
miss
manning
told
her
so
too
when
we
got
home
and
wilson
heard
of
it
she
said
lucy
deserved
a
good
why
must
not
lady
isabel
be
talked
of
to
him
a
moment
after
the
question
had
left
her
lips
she
wondered
what
possessed
her
to
give
utterance
to
it
i
ll
tell
you
said
william
in
a
whisper
she
ran
away
from
papa
lucy
talks
nonsense
about
her
having
been
kidnapped
but
she
knows
nothing
i
do
though
they
don
t
think
it
she
may
be
among
the
redeemed
some
time
william
and
you
with
he
fell
back
on
the
with
a
weary
sigh
and
lay
in
silence
lady
isabel
shaded
her
face
and
remained
in
silence
also
soon
she
was
aroused
from
it
william
was
in
a
fit
of
loud
sobbing
tears
oh
i
don
t
want
to
die
i
don
t
want
to
die
why
should
i
go
and
leave
papa
and
lucy
she
hung
over
him
she
clasped
her
arms
around
him
her
tears
her
sobs
mingling
with
his
she
whispered
to
him
sweet
and
soothing
words
she
placed
him
so
that
he
might
sob
out
his
grief
upon
her
bosom
and
in
a
little
while
the
paroxysm
had
passed
hark
exclaimed
william
what
s
that
a
sound
of
talking
and
laughter
in
the
hall
carlyle
lord
mount
severn
and
his
son
were
leaving
the
they
had
some
committee
appointed
that
evening
at
west
lynne
and
were
departing
to
keep
it
as
the
closed
upon
them
barbara
came
into
the
gray
parlor
up
rose
madame
vine
scuffled
on
her
spectacles
and
took
her
seat
soberly
upon
a
chair
all
in
the
dark
and
your
fire
going
out
exclaimed
barbara
as
she
hastened
to
stir
the
latter
and
send
it
into
a
blaze
who
s
on
the
sofa
william
you
ought
to
be
to
bed
not
yet
mamma
i
don
t
want
to
go
but
it
is
quite
time
that
you
should
she
returned
ringing
the
bell
to
sit
up
at
night
is
not
the
way
to
make
you
william
was
dismissed
and
then
she
returned
to
madame
vine
and
inquired
what
martin
had
said
he
said
the
lungs
were
undoubtedly
affected
but
like
all
doctors
he
would
give
no
decisive
opinion
i
could
see
that
he
had
formed
carlyle
looked
at
her
the
firelight
played
especially
upon
the
spectacles
and
she
moved
her
chair
into
the
shade
dr
martin
will
see
him
again
next
week
he
is
coming
to
west
lynne
i
am
sure
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
by
his
evasive
manner
that
he
anticipates
the
worst
although
he
would
not
say
so
in
i
will
take
william
into
west
lynne
myself
observed
barbara
the
doctor
will
of
course
tell
me
i
came
in
to
pay
my
debts
she
added
dismissing
the
subject
of
the
child
and
holding
out
a
note
lady
isabel
mechanically
stretched
out
her
hand
for
it
whilst
we
are
as
may
be
said
upon
the
money
topic
resumed
barbara
in
a
gay
tone
will
you
allow
me
to
intimate
that
both
myself
and
carlyle
very
much
disapprove
of
your
making
presents
to
the
children
i
was
calculating
at
a
rough
guess
the
cost
of
the
toys
and
things
you
have
bought
for
them
and
i
think
it
must
amount
to
a
very
large
portion
of
the
salary
you
have
received
pray
do
not
continue
this
madame
i
have
no
one
else
to
spend
my
money
on
i
love
the
children
was
madame
s
answer
somewhat
sharply
given
as
if
she
were
jealous
of
the
interference
between
her
and
the
children
and
would
resent
it
nay
you
have
yourself
and
if
you
do
not
require
much
outlay
you
have
i
should
suppose
a
reserve
fund
to
which
to
put
your
money
be
so
kind
as
to
take
the
hint
madame
otherwise
i
shall
be
compelled
more
peremptorily
to
forbid
your
generosity
it
is
very
good
of
you
very
kind
but
if
you
do
not
think
yourself
we
must
for
i
will
buy
them
less
was
the
murmured
answer
i
must
give
them
a
little
token
of
love
now
and
that
you
are
welcome
to
do
a
little
token
once
in
a
way
but
not
the
costly
toys
you
have
been
purchasing
have
you
ever
had
an
acquaintance
with
sir
francis
levison
continued
carlyle
passing
with
abruptness
from
one
point
to
another
an
inward
shiver
a
burning
cheek
a
heartpang
of
wild
remorse
and
a
faint
answer
i
fancied
from
your
manner
when
i
was
speaking
of
him
the
other
day
that
you
knew
him
or
had
known
him
no
compliment
you
will
say
to
assume
an
acquaintance
with
such
a
man
he
is
a
stranger
to
you
then
another
faint
reply
barbara
paused
do
you
believe
in
fatality
madame
vine
yes
i
do
was
the
steady
answer
i
don
t
and
yet
the
very
question
proved
that
she
did
not
wholly
disbelieve
it
no
i
don
t
added
barbara
stoutly
as
she
approached
the
sofa
vacated
by
william
and
sat
down
upon
it
thus
bringing
herself
opposite
and
near
to
madame
vine
are
you
aware
that
it
was
francis
levison
who
brought
the
evil
to
this
house
the
evil
stammered
madame
vine
yes
it
was
he
she
resumed
taking
the
hesitating
answer
for
an
admission
that
the
governess
knew
nothing
or
but
little
of
past
events
it
was
he
who
took
lady
isabel
from
her
home
though
perhaps
she
was
as
willing
to
go
as
he
was
to
take
her
i
do
know
oh
no
no
broke
from
the
unguarded
lips
of
madame
vine
at
least
i
mean
i
should
think
not
she
added
in
confusion
we
shall
never
know
and
of
what
consequence
is
it
one
thing
is
certain
she
went
another
thing
almost
equally
certain
is
she
did
not
go
against
her
will
did
you
ever
hear
the
details
n
her
answer
would
have
been
yes
but
possibly
the
next
question
might
have
been
from
whom
did
you
hear
them
he
was
staying
at
east
lynne
the
man
had
been
abroad
outlawed
dared
not
show
his
face
in
england
and
carlyle
in
his
generosity
invited
him
to
east
lynne
as
a
place
of
shelter
where
he
would
be
safe
from
his
creditors
while
something
was
arranged
he
was
a
connection
in
some
way
of
lady
isabel
s
and
they
repaid
carlyle
he
and
she
by
quitting
east
lynne
why
did
carlyle
give
that
invitation
the
words
were
uttered
in
a
spirit
of
remorseful
wailing
carlyle
believed
they
were
a
question
put
and
she
rose
up
haughtily
against
it
why
did
he
give
the
invitation
did
i
hear
you
aright
madame
vine
did
carlyle
know
he
was
a
reprobate
and
if
he
had
known
it
was
not
isabel
his
wife
could
he
dream
of
danger
for
her
if
it
pleased
carlyle
to
fill
east
lynne
with
bad
men
what
would
that
be
to
me
to
my
safety
to
my
to
my
love
and
allegiance
to
my
husband
what
were
you
thinking
of
madame
thinking
of
she
leaned
her
troubled
head
upon
her
hand
carlyle
resumed
sitting
alone
in
the
just
now
and
thinking
matters
over
it
did
seem
to
me
very
like
what
people
call
a
fatality
that
man
i
say
was
the
one
who
wrought
the
disgrace
the
trouble
to
carlyle
s
family
and
it
is
he
i
have
every
reason
now
to
believe
who
brought
a
nearly
equal
disgrace
and
trouble
upon
mine
did
you
know
carlyle
lowered
her
voice
that
i
have
a
brother
in
evil
in
shame
lady
isabel
did
not
dare
to
answer
that
she
did
know
it
who
had
there
been
likely
to
inform
her
the
strange
governess
of
the
tale
of
richard
hare
so
the
world
calls
it
shame
pursued
barbara
growing
excited
and
it
is
shame
but
not
as
the
world
thinks
it
the
shame
lies
with
another
who
had
thrust
the
suffering
and
shame
upon
richard
and
that
other
is
francis
levison
i
will
tell
you
the
tale
it
is
worth
the
she
could
only
dispose
herself
to
listen
but
she
wondered
what
francis
levison
had
to
do
with
richard
hare
in
the
days
long
gone
by
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
child
richard
took
to
going
after
afy
hallijohn
you
have
seen
the
cottage
in
the
wood
she
lived
there
with
her
father
and
joyce
it
was
very
foolish
for
him
but
young
men
will
be
foolish
as
many
more
went
after
her
or
wanted
to
go
after
her
as
she
could
count
upon
her
ten
fingers
among
them
chief
of
them
more
favored
even
than
richard
was
one
called
thorn
by
social
position
a
gentleman
he
was
a
stranger
and
used
to
ride
over
in
secret
the
night
of
the
murder
came
the
dreadful
murder
when
hallijohn
was
shot
down
dead
richard
ran
away
testimony
was
strong
against
him
and
the
coroner
s
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
richard
hare
the
we
never
supposed
but
what
he
was
guilty
of
the
act
mind
you
not
of
the
intention
even
mamma
who
so
loved
him
believed
he
had
done
it
but
she
believed
it
was
the
result
of
accident
not
design
oh
the
trouble
that
has
been
the
lot
of
my
poor
mamma
cried
barbara
clasping
her
hands
and
she
had
no
one
to
sympathize
with
her
no
one
no
one
i
as
i
tell
you
was
little
more
than
a
child
and
papa
who
might
have
done
it
took
part
against
richard
it
went
on
for
three
or
four
years
the
sorrow
and
there
was
no
mitigation
at
the
end
of
that
period
richard
came
for
a
few
hours
to
west
lynne
came
in
secret
and
we
learnt
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
not
guilty
the
man
who
did
the
deed
was
thorn
richard
was
not
even
present
the
next
question
was
how
to
find
thorn
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
who
he
was
what
he
was
where
he
came
from
where
he
went
to
and
thus
more
years
passed
on
another
thorn
came
to
west
lynne
an
officer
in
her
majesty
s
service
and
his
appearance
tallied
with
the
description
richard
had
given
i
assumed
it
to
be
the
one
carlyle
assumed
it
but
before
anything
could
be
done
or
even
thought
of
captain
thorn
was
gone
barbara
paused
to
take
breath
madame
vine
sat
listless
enough
what
was
this
tale
to
her
again
years
went
on
the
period
came
of
francis
levison
s
sojourn
at
east
lynne
whilst
i
was
there
captain
thorn
arrived
once
more
on
a
visit
to
the
herberts
we
then
strove
to
find
out
points
of
his
antecedents
carlyle
and
i
and
we
became
nearly
convinced
that
he
was
the
man
i
had
to
come
here
often
to
see
carlyle
for
mamma
did
not
dare
to
stir
in
the
affair
papa
was
so
violent
against
richard
thus
i
often
saw
francis
levison
but
he
was
visible
to
scarcely
any
other
visitor
being
at
east
lynne
en
cachette
he
intimated
that
he
was
afraid
of
encountering
creditors
i
now
begin
to
doubt
whether
that
was
not
a
false
plea
and
i
remember
carlyle
said
at
the
time
that
he
had
no
creditors
in
or
near
west
then
what
was
his
motive
for
shunning
society
for
never
going
out
interrupted
lady
isabel
too
well
she
remembered
that
bygone
time
francis
levison
had
told
that
the
fear
of
his
creditors
kept
him
up
so
closely
though
he
had
once
said
to
her
they
were
not
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
east
lynne
he
had
a
worse
fear
upon
him
than
that
of
creditors
returned
carlyle
singular
to
say
during
this
visit
of
captain
thorn
to
the
herberts
we
received
an
intimation
from
my
brother
that
he
was
once
more
about
to
venture
for
a
few
hours
to
west
lynne
i
brought
the
news
to
carlyle
i
had
to
see
him
and
consult
with
him
more
frequently
than
ever
mamma
was
painfully
restless
and
anxious
and
carlyle
as
eager
as
we
were
for
the
establishment
of
richard
s
innocence
for
miss
carlyle
and
papa
are
related
consequently
the
disgrace
may
be
said
to
reflect
on
the
carlyle
back
went
lady
isabel
s
memory
and
her
bitter
repentance
she
remembered
how
jealously
she
had
attributed
these
meetings
between
carlyle
and
barbara
to
another
source
oh
why
had
she
suffered
her
mind
to
be
so
falsely
and
fatally
perverted
richard
came
it
was
hastily
arranged
that
he
should
go
privately
to
carlyle
s
office
after
the
clerks
had
left
for
the
night
be
concealed
there
and
have
an
opportunity
given
him
of
seeing
captain
thorn
there
was
no
difficulty
for
carlyle
was
transacting
some
matter
of
business
for
the
captain
and
appointed
him
to
be
at
the
office
at
eight
o
clock
a
memorable
night
that
to
carlyle
for
it
was
the
one
of
his
wife
s
lady
isabel
looked
up
with
a
start
it
was
indeed
she
lady
isabel
and
carlyle
were
engaged
to
a
dinner
party
and
carlyle
had
to
give
it
up
otherwise
he
could
not
have
served
richard
he
is
always
considerate
and
kind
thinking
of
others
welfare
never
of
his
own
gratification
oh
it
was
an
anxious
night
papa
was
out
i
waited
at
home
with
mamma
doing
what
i
could
to
sooth
her
restless
suspense
for
there
was
hazard
to
richard
in
his
night
walk
through
west
lynne
to
keep
the
appointment
and
when
it
was
over
he
was
to
come
home
for
a
short
interview
with
mamma
who
had
not
seen
him
for
several
barbara
stopped
lost
in
thought
not
a
word
spoke
madame
vine
she
still
wondered
what
this
affair
touching
richard
hare
and
thorn
could
have
to
do
with
francis
levison
i
watched
from
the
window
and
saw
them
come
in
at
the
garden
gate
carlyle
and
richard
between
nine
and
ten
o
clock
i
think
it
must
have
been
then
the
first
words
they
said
to
me
were
that
it
was
not
the
captain
thorn
spoken
of
by
richard
i
felt
a
shock
of
disappointment
which
was
wicked
enough
of
me
but
i
had
been
so
sure
he
was
the
man
and
to
hear
that
he
was
not
seemed
to
throw
us
further
back
than
ever
carlyle
on
the
contrary
was
glad
for
he
had
taken
a
liking
to
captain
thorn
well
richard
went
in
to
mamma
and
carlyle
was
so
kind
as
to
accede
to
her
request
that
he
would
remain
and
pace
the
garden
with
me
we
were
so
afraid
of
papa
s
coming
home
he
was
bitter
against
richard
and
would
inevitably
have
delivered
him
up
at
once
to
justice
had
he
come
in
carlyle
was
to
keep
him
in
the
garden
by
the
gate
whilst
i
ran
in
to
give
notice
and
conceal
richard
in
the
hall
richard
lingered
papa
did
not
come
and
i
can
not
tell
how
long
we
paced
there
but
i
had
my
shawl
on
and
it
was
a
lovely
moonlight
that
unhappy
listener
clasped
her
hands
to
pain
the
tone
the
unconscious
mention
of
commonplace
trifles
proved
that
they
had
not
been
pacing
about
in
disloyalty
to
her
or
for
their
own
gratification
why
had
she
not
trusted
her
noble
husband
why
had
she
listened
to
that
false
man
as
he
pointed
them
out
to
her
walking
there
in
the
moonlight
why
had
she
given
vent
in
the
chariot
to
that
burst
of
passionate
tears
of
angry
reproach
why
oh
why
had
she
hastened
to
be
revenged
but
for
seeing
them
together
she
might
not
have
done
as
she
did
richard
came
forth
at
last
and
departed
to
be
again
an
exile
carlyle
also
departed
and
i
remained
at
the
gate
watching
for
papa
by
and
by
carlyle
came
back
again
he
had
got
nearly
home
when
he
remembered
that
he
had
left
a
parchment
at
our
house
it
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
coming
back
for
just
after
he
had
gone
a
second
time
richard
returned
in
a
state
of
excitement
stating
that
he
had
seen
thorn
thorn
the
murderer
i
mean
in
bean
lane
for
a
moment
i
doubted
him
but
not
for
long
and
we
ran
after
carlyle
richard
described
thorn
s
appearance
his
evening
dress
his
white
hands
and
diamond
ring
more
particularly
he
described
a
peculiar
motion
of
his
hand
as
he
threw
back
his
hair
in
that
moment
it
flashed
across
me
that
thorn
must
be
captain
levison
the
description
was
exact
many
and
many
a
time
since
have
i
wondered
that
the
thought
did
not
strike
lady
isabel
sat
with
her
mouth
open
as
if
she
could
not
take
in
the
sense
of
the
words
and
when
it
did
become
clear
to
her
she
utterly
rejected
it
francis
levison
a
murderer
oh
no
bad
man
as
he
is
he
is
not
wait
said
carlyle
i
did
not
speak
of
this
doubt
nay
this
conviction
which
had
come
how
could
i
mention
to
carlyle
the
name
of
the
man
who
did
him
that
foul
wrong
and
richard
has
remained
so
long
in
exile
with
the
ban
of
guilt
upon
him
as
my
carriage
passed
through
west
lynne
francis
levison
was
haranguing
the
people
i
saw
that
very
same
action
the
throwing
back
of
the
hair
with
his
white
hand
i
saw
the
selfsame
diamond
ring
and
my
conviction
that
he
was
the
same
man
became
more
firmly
seated
than
it
is
impossible
murmured
lady
isabel
wait
i
say
said
barbara
when
carlyle
came
home
to
dinner
i
for
the
first
time
mentioned
this
to
him
it
was
no
news
the
fact
was
not
this
afternoon
during
that
same
harangue
francis
levison
was
recognized
by
two
witnesses
to
be
the
man
thorn
the
man
who
went
after
afy
hallijohn
it
is
lady
isabel
sat
and
looked
at
carlyle
not
yet
did
she
believe
it
yes
it
does
appear
to
me
as
being
perfectly
horrible
continued
carlyle
he
murdered
hallijohn
he
that
bad
man
and
my
poor
brother
has
suffered
the
odium
when
richard
met
him
that
night
in
bean
lane
he
was
sneaking
to
west
lynne
in
search
of
the
chaise
that
afterward
bore
away
him
and
his
companion
papa
saw
them
drive
away
papa
stayed
out
late
and
in
returning
home
a
chaise
and
four
tore
past
just
as
he
was
turning
in
at
the
gate
if
that
miserable
lady
isabel
had
but
known
with
whom
she
was
flying
a
murderer
in
addition
to
his
other
achievements
it
is
a
mercy
for
her
that
she
is
no
longer
alive
what
would
her
feelings
be
what
were
they
then
as
she
sat
there
a
murderer
and
she
had
in
spite
of
her
caution
of
her
strife
for
she
turned
of
a
deadly
whiteness
and
a
low
sharp
cry
of
horror
and
despair
burst
from
her
lips
carlyle
was
astonished
why
should
her
communication
have
produced
this
effect
upon
madame
vine
a
renewed
suspicion
that
she
knew
more
of
francis
levison
than
she
would
acknowledge
stole
over
her
madame
vine
what
is
he
to
you
she
asked
bending
forward
madame
vine
doing
fierce
battle
with
herself
recovered
her
outward
equanimity
i
beg
your
pardon
carlyle
she
said
shivering
i
am
apt
to
picture
things
too
vividly
it
is
as
you
say
so
very
is
he
nothing
to
you
don
t
you
know
him
he
is
nothing
to
me
less
than
nothing
as
to
knowing
him
i
saw
him
yesterday
when
they
put
him
into
the
pond
a
man
like
that
i
should
shudder
to
meet
him
ay
indeed
said
barbara
reassured
you
will
understand
madame
vine
that
this
history
has
been
given
to
you
in
confidence
i
look
upon
you
as
one
of
there
was
no
answer
madame
vine
sat
on
with
her
white
face
she
and
it
wore
altogether
a
ghastly
look
it
tells
like
a
fable
out
of
a
romance
resumed
carlyle
well
for
him
if
the
romance
be
not
ended
in
the
gibbet
fancy
what
it
would
be
for
him
sir
francis
levison
to
be
hung
for
murder
barbara
my
dearest
the
voice
was
carlyle
s
and
she
flew
off
on
the
wings
of
love
it
appeared
that
the
gentlemen
had
not
yet
departed
and
now
thought
they
would
take
coffee
first
she
flew
off
to
her
idolized
husband
leaving
her
who
had
once
been
idolized
to
her
loneliness
she
sank
down
on
the
sofa
she
threw
her
arms
up
in
her
she
thought
she
would
faint
she
prayed
to
die
it
was
horrible
as
barbara
had
called
it
for
that
man
with
the
red
stain
upon
his
hand
and
soul
she
had
flung
away
archibald
carlyle
if
ever
retribution
came
home
to
woman
it
came
home
in
that
hour
to
lady
isabel
chapter
xxxvii
carlyle
invited
to
some
pate
de
foie
gras
a
sighing
morning
wind
swept
round
the
domains
of
east
lynne
bending
the
tall
poplar
trees
in
the
distance
swaying
the
oak
and
elms
nearer
rustling
the
fine
old
chestnuts
in
the
park
a
melancholy
sweeping
fitful
wind
the
weather
had
changed
from
brightness
and
warmth
and
heavy
gathering
clouds
seemed
to
be
threatening
rain
so
at
least
deemed
one
wayfarer
who
was
journeying
on
a
solitary
road
that
saturday
night
he
was
on
foot
a
man
attired
in
the
garb
of
a
sailor
with
black
curling
ringlets
of
hair
and
black
curling
whiskers
a
prodigious
pair
of
whiskers
hiding
his
neck
above
his
blue
turned
collar
hiding
partially
his
face
the
glazed
hat
brought
low
upon
his
brows
concealed
it
still
more
and
he
wore
a
loose
rough
and
wide
rough
trousers
hitched
up
with
a
belt
bearing
steadily
on
he
struck
into
bean
lane
a
already
mentioned
in
this
history
and
from
thence
passing
through
a
small
unfrequented
gate
he
found
himself
in
the
grounds
of
east
lynne
let
me
see
mused
he
as
he
closed
the
gate
behind
him
and
slipped
the
bolt
the
covered
walk
that
must
be
near
the
acacia
trees
then
i
must
wind
round
to
the
right
i
wonder
if
either
of
them
will
be
there
waiting
for
me
yes
pacing
the
covered
walk
in
her
bonnet
and
mantle
as
if
taking
an
evening
stroll
had
any
one
encountered
her
which
was
very
unlikely
seeing
that
it
was
the
most
retired
spot
in
the
grounds
was
carlyle
oh
richard
my
poor
brother
locked
in
a
yearning
embrace
emotion
overpowered
both
barbara
sobbed
like
a
child
a
little
while
and
then
he
put
her
from
him
to
look
at
her
so
barbara
you
are
a
wife
now
oh
the
happiest
wife
richard
sometimes
i
ask
myself
what
i
have
done
that
god
should
have
showered
down
blessings
so
great
upon
me
but
for
the
sad
trouble
when
i
think
of
you
my
life
would
be
as
one
long
summer
s
day
i
have
the
sweetest
baby
nearly
a
year
old
he
is
now
i
shall
have
another
soon
god
willing
and
archibald
oh
i
am
so
happy
she
broke
suddenly
off
with
the
name
archibald
not
even
to
richard
could
she
speak
of
her
intense
love
for
and
happiness
in
her
husband
how
is
it
at
the
grove
he
asked
quite
well
quite
as
usual
mamma
has
been
in
better
health
lately
she
does
not
know
of
this
visit
but
i
must
see
her
interrupted
richard
i
did
not
see
her
the
last
time
you
all
in
good
time
to
talk
of
that
how
are
you
getting
on
in
liverpool
what
are
you
doing
don
t
inquire
too
closely
barbara
i
have
no
regular
work
but
i
get
a
job
at
the
docks
now
and
then
and
rub
on
it
is
seasonable
help
that
which
comes
to
me
occasionally
from
you
is
it
from
you
or
carlyle
barbara
laughed
how
are
we
to
distinguish
his
money
is
mine
now
and
mine
is
his
we
don
t
have
separate
purses
richard
we
send
it
to
you
sometimes
i
have
fancied
it
came
from
my
barbara
shook
her
head
we
have
never
allowed
mamma
to
know
that
you
left
london
or
that
we
hold
an
address
where
we
can
write
to
you
it
would
not
have
why
have
you
summoned
me
here
barbara
what
has
turned
up
thorn
has
i
think
you
would
know
him
again
richard
know
him
passionately
echoed
richard
hare
were
you
aware
that
a
contest
for
the
membership
is
going
on
at
west
lynne
i
saw
it
in
the
newspapers
carlyle
against
sir
francis
levison
i
say
barbara
how
could
he
think
of
coming
here
to
oppose
carlyle
after
his
doing
with
lady
isabel
i
don
t
know
said
barbara
i
wonder
that
he
should
come
here
for
other
reasons
also
first
of
all
richard
tell
me
how
you
came
to
know
sir
francis
levison
you
say
you
did
know
him
and
that
you
had
seen
him
with
so
i
do
know
him
answered
richard
and
i
saw
him
with
thorn
know
him
by
sight
only
i
presume
let
me
hear
how
you
came
to
know
he
was
pointed
out
to
me
i
saw
him
walk
with
a
gentleman
and
i
showed
them
to
the
waterman
at
the
hard
by
do
you
know
that
fellow
i
asked
him
indicating
thorn
for
i
wanted
to
come
at
who
he
really
is
which
i
didn
t
do
i
don
t
know
that
one
the
old
chap
answered
but
the
one
with
him
is
levison
the
baronet
they
are
often
together
a
couple
of
swells
they
and
that
s
how
you
got
to
know
levison
that
was
it
said
richard
hare
then
richard
you
and
the
waterman
made
a
mess
of
it
between
you
he
pointed
out
the
wrong
one
or
you
did
not
look
at
the
right
thorn
is
sir
francis
richard
stared
at
her
with
all
his
eyes
nonsense
barbara
he
is
i
have
never
doubted
it
since
the
night
you
saw
him
in
bean
lane
the
action
you
described
of
his
pushing
back
his
hair
his
white
hands
his
sparkling
diamond
ring
could
only
apply
in
my
mind
to
one
person
francis
levison
on
thursday
i
drove
by
the
raven
when
he
was
speechifying
to
the
people
and
i
noticed
the
selfsame
action
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
wrote
off
for
you
that
you
might
come
and
set
the
doubt
at
rest
i
need
not
have
done
it
it
seems
for
when
carlyle
returned
home
that
evening
and
i
acquainted
him
with
what
i
had
done
he
told
me
that
thorn
and
francis
levison
are
one
and
the
same
otway
bethel
recognized
him
that
same
afternoon
and
so
did
ebenezer
they
d
both
know
him
eagerly
cried
richard
james
i
am
positive
would
for
he
was
skulking
down
to
hallijohn
s
often
then
and
saw
thorn
a
dozen
times
otway
bethel
must
have
seen
him
also
though
he
protested
he
had
not
barbara
the
name
was
uttered
in
affright
and
richard
plunged
amidst
the
trees
for
somebody
was
in
sight
a
tall
dark
form
advancing
from
the
end
of
the
walk
barbara
smiled
it
was
only
carlyle
and
richard
emerged
again
fears
still
richard
carlyle
exclaimed
as
he
shook
richard
cordially
by
the
hand
so
you
have
changed
your
travelling
i
couldn
t
venture
here
again
in
the
old
suit
it
had
been
seen
you
said
returned
richard
i
bought
this
yesterday
two
pounds
for
the
lot
i
think
they
shaved
ringlets
and
all
laughed
carlyle
it
s
the
old
hair
oiled
and
curled
cried
dick
the
barber
charged
a
shilling
for
doing
it
and
cut
my
hair
into
the
bargain
i
told
him
not
to
spare
grease
for
i
liked
the
curls
to
shine
sailors
always
do
carlyle
barbara
says
that
levison
and
that
brute
thorn
the
one
s
as
much
of
a
brute
as
the
other
though
have
turned
out
to
be
the
they
have
richard
as
it
appears
nevertheless
it
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
take
a
private
view
of
levison
before
anything
is
done
as
you
once
did
by
the
other
thorn
it
would
not
do
to
make
a
stir
and
then
discover
that
there
was
a
mistake
that
he
was
not
when
can
i
see
him
asked
richard
eagerly
it
must
be
contrived
somehow
were
you
to
hang
about
the
doors
of
the
raven
this
evening
even
you
d
be
sure
to
get
the
opportunity
for
he
is
always
passing
in
and
out
no
one
will
know
you
or
think
of
you
either
their
heads
are
turned
with
the
i
shall
look
odd
to
people
s
eyes
you
don
t
get
many
sailors
in
west
not
odd
at
all
we
have
a
russian
bear
here
at
present
and
you
ll
be
nobody
beside
a
russian
bear
repeated
richard
while
barbara
laughed
mr
otway
bethel
has
returned
in
what
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
bear
s
hide
hence
the
new
name
he
is
greeted
with
will
it
turn
out
richard
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
murder
richard
shook
his
head
he
couldn
t
have
carlyle
i
have
said
so
all
along
but
about
levison
if
i
find
him
to
be
the
man
thorn
what
steps
can
then
be
taken
that
s
the
difficulty
said
carlyle
who
will
set
it
agoing
who
will
move
in
it
you
must
i
uttered
richard
hare
in
consternation
i
move
in
it
you
yourself
who
else
is
there
i
have
been
thinking
it
well
over
and
can
hit
upon
no
why
won
t
you
take
it
upon
yourself
carlyle
no
being
levison
was
the
answer
curse
him
impetuously
retorted
richard
curse
him
doubly
if
he
be
the
double
villain
but
why
should
you
scruple
carlyle
most
men
wronged
as
you
have
been
would
leap
at
the
opportunity
for
for
the
crime
perpetrated
upon
hallijohn
i
would
pursue
him
to
the
scaffold
for
my
own
wrong
no
but
the
remaining
negative
has
cost
me
something
many
a
time
since
this
appearance
of
his
at
west
lynne
have
i
been
obliged
to
lay
violent
control
upon
myself
or
i
should
have
horsewhipped
him
within
an
ace
of
his
if
you
horsewhipped
him
to
death
he
would
only
meet
his
i
leave
him
to
a
higher
retribution
to
one
who
says
vengeance
is
i
believe
him
to
be
guilty
of
the
murder
but
if
the
uplifting
of
my
finger
would
send
him
to
his
disgraceful
death
i
would
tie
down
my
hand
rather
than
lift
it
for
i
could
not
in
my
own
mind
separate
the
man
from
the
injury
though
i
might
ostensibly
pursue
him
as
the
destroyer
of
hallijohn
to
me
he
would
appear
ever
as
the
destroyer
of
another
and
the
world
always
charitable
would
congratulate
carlyle
upon
gratifying
his
revenge
i
stir
in
it
not
couldn
t
barbara
pleaded
richard
barbara
was
standing
with
her
arm
entwined
within
her
husband
s
and
carlyle
looked
down
as
he
answered
barbara
is
my
it
was
a
sufficient
answer
then
the
thing
s
again
at
an
end
said
richard
gloomily
and
i
must
give
up
hope
of
ever
being
by
no
means
said
carlyle
the
one
who
ought
to
act
in
this
is
your
father
richard
but
we
know
he
will
not
your
mother
can
not
she
has
neither
health
nor
energy
for
it
and
if
she
had
a
full
supply
of
both
she
would
not
dare
to
brave
her
husband
and
use
them
in
the
cause
my
hands
are
tied
barbara
s
equally
so
as
part
of
me
there
only
remains
and
what
can
i
do
wailed
poor
dick
if
your
hands
are
tied
i
m
sure
my
whole
body
is
speaking
in
comparison
hands
and
legs
and
neck
it
s
in
jeopardy
that
is
every
your
acting
in
this
affair
need
not
put
it
any
the
more
in
jeopardy
you
must
stay
in
the
neighborhood
for
a
few
days
i
dare
not
interposed
richard
in
a
fright
stay
in
the
neighborhood
for
a
few
days
no
that
i
never
listen
richard
you
must
put
away
these
timorous
fears
or
else
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
remain
under
the
ban
for
good
and
remember
your
mother
s
happiness
is
at
stake
equally
with
yours
i
could
almost
say
her
life
do
you
suppose
i
would
advise
you
for
danger
you
used
to
say
there
was
some
place
a
mile
or
two
from
this
where
you
could
sojourn
in
so
there
is
but
i
always
feel
safer
when
i
get
away
from
there
your
quarters
must
be
for
two
or
three
days
at
any
rate
i
have
turned
matters
over
in
my
own
mind
and
will
tell
you
what
i
think
should
be
done
so
far
as
the
preliminary
step
goes
though
i
do
not
interfere
only
the
preliminary
step
there
must
be
a
pretty
many
to
follow
it
sir
if
it
s
to
come
to
anything
well
what
is
it
apply
to
ball
treadman
and
get
them
to
take
they
were
now
slowly
pacing
the
covered
walk
barbara
on
her
husband
s
arm
richard
by
the
side
of
carlyle
dick
stopped
when
he
heard
the
last
words
i
don
t
understand
you
carlyle
you
might
as
well
advise
me
to
go
before
the
bench
of
magistrates
at
once
ball
treadman
would
walk
me
off
there
as
soon
as
i
showed
nothing
of
the
sort
richard
i
do
not
tell
you
to
go
openly
to
their
office
as
another
client
would
what
i
would
advise
is
this
make
a
friend
of
ball
he
can
be
a
good
man
and
true
if
he
chooses
tell
the
whole
story
to
him
in
a
private
place
and
interview
and
ask
him
whether
he
will
carry
it
through
if
he
is
fully
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
you
are
innocent
as
the
facts
appear
to
warrant
he
will
undertake
it
treadman
need
know
nothing
of
the
affair
at
first
and
when
ball
puts
things
in
motion
he
need
not
know
that
you
are
here
or
where
you
are
to
be
i
don
t
dislike
ball
mused
richard
and
if
he
would
only
give
his
word
to
be
true
i
know
he
would
be
the
difficulty
will
be
who
is
to
get
the
promise
from
him
i
will
said
carlyle
i
will
so
far
pave
the
way
for
you
that
done
my
interference
is
how
will
he
go
about
it
think
you
if
he
does
take
it
up
that
is
his
affair
i
know
how
i
how
sir
you
can
not
expect
me
to
say
richard
i
might
as
well
act
for
i
know
you
d
go
at
it
and
arrest
levison
offhand
on
the
a
smile
parted
carlyle
s
lips
for
dick
had
just
guessed
it
but
his
countenance
gave
no
clue
by
which
anything
could
be
gathered
a
thought
flashed
across
richard
s
mind
a
thought
which
rose
up
on
end
even
his
false
hair
mr
carlyle
he
uttered
in
an
accent
of
horror
if
ball
should
take
it
up
in
that
way
against
levison
he
must
apply
to
the
bench
for
a
well
quietly
returned
carlyle
and
they
d
send
and
clap
me
into
prison
you
know
the
warrant
is
always
out
against
you
d
never
make
a
conjurer
richard
i
don
t
pretend
to
say
or
guess
at
what
ball
s
proceedings
may
be
but
in
applying
to
the
bench
for
a
warrant
against
levison
should
that
form
part
of
them
is
there
any
necessity
for
him
to
bring
you
in
to
say
gentlemen
richard
hare
is
within
reach
ready
to
be
taken
your
fears
run
away
with
your
common
sense
ah
well
if
you
had
lived
with
the
cord
around
your
neck
this
many
a
year
not
knowing
any
one
hour
but
it
might
get
tied
the
next
you
d
lose
your
common
sense
too
at
times
humbly
sighed
poor
richard
what
s
to
be
my
first
move
sir
your
first
move
richard
must
be
to
go
to
this
place
of
concealment
which
you
know
of
and
remain
quiet
there
until
monday
on
monday
at
dusk
be
here
again
meanwhile
i
will
see
ball
by
the
way
though
before
speaking
to
ball
i
must
hear
from
yourself
that
thorn
and
levison
are
i
will
go
down
to
the
raven
at
once
eagerly
cried
richard
i
ll
come
back
here
to
this
walk
as
soon
as
i
have
obtained
sight
of
with
the
last
words
he
turned
and
was
speeding
off
when
barbara
caught
him
you
will
be
so
tired
tired
echoed
richard
hare
a
hundred
miles
on
foot
would
not
tire
me
if
thorn
was
at
the
end
of
them
waiting
to
be
identified
i
may
not
be
back
for
two
or
three
hours
but
i
will
come
and
wait
here
till
you
come
out
to
you
must
be
hungry
and
thirsty
returned
barbara
the
tears
in
her
eyes
how
i
wish
we
dare
have
you
in
and
shelter
you
but
i
can
manage
to
bring
some
refreshments
out
i
don
t
require
it
barbara
i
left
the
train
at
the
station
next
before
west
lynne
and
dropped
into
a
roadside
public
house
as
i
walked
and
got
a
good
supper
let
me
go
dear
i
am
all
in
a
richard
departed
reached
the
part
of
west
lynne
where
the
raven
was
situated
and
was
so
far
favored
by
fortune
that
he
had
not
long
to
wait
scarcely
had
he
taken
up
his
lounge
outside
when
two
gentlemen
came
forth
from
it
being
the
headquarters
of
one
of
the
candidates
the
idlers
of
the
place
thought
they
could
not
do
better
than
make
it
their
headquarters
also
and
the
road
and
pavement
were
never
free
from
loitering
starers
and
gossipers
richard
hare
his
hat
well
over
his
eyes
and
his
black
ringlets
made
the
most
of
only
added
one
to
the
rest
two
gentlemen
came
forth
the
loiterers
raised
a
feeble
shout
of
levison
forever
richard
did
not
join
in
the
shout
but
his
pulses
were
beating
and
his
heart
leaped
up
within
him
the
one
was
thorn
the
other
the
gentleman
he
had
seen
with
thorn
in
london
pointed
out
to
him
as
he
had
believed
as
sir
francis
levison
which
of
those
two
is
levison
he
inquired
of
a
man
near
whom
he
stood
don
t
you
know
him
him
with
the
hat
off
bowing
his
thanks
to
us
is
no
need
to
inquire
further
it
was
the
thorn
of
richard
s
memory
his
ungloved
hand
raised
to
his
hat
was
as
white
as
ever
more
sparkling
than
ever
as
it
flashed
in
the
street
gaslight
was
the
diamond
ring
by
the
hand
and
ring
alone
richard
would
have
sworn
to
the
man
had
it
been
needful
who
is
the
other
one
he
continued
some
gent
as
came
down
from
london
with
him
his
name
s
drake
be
you
yellow
sailor
or
be
you
i
am
neither
i
am
only
a
stranger
passing
through
the
on
the
tramp
tramp
and
richard
moved
away
to
make
the
best
of
his
progress
to
east
lynne
and
report
to
carlyle
now
it
happened
on
that
windy
night
that
lady
isabel
her
mind
disordered
her
brow
fevered
with
its
weight
of
care
stole
out
into
the
grounds
after
the
children
had
left
her
for
the
night
courting
any
discomfort
she
might
meet
as
if
they
could
even
for
a
moment
cool
the
fire
within
to
the
solitude
of
this
very
covered
walk
bent
she
her
steps
and
not
long
had
she
paced
it
when
she
descried
some
man
advancing
in
the
garb
of
a
sailor
not
caring
to
be
seen
she
turned
short
off
amidst
the
trees
intending
to
emerge
again
when
he
had
passed
she
wondered
who
he
was
and
what
brought
him
there
but
he
did
not
pass
he
lingered
in
the
walk
keeping
her
a
prisoner
a
minute
more
and
she
saw
him
joined
by
carlyle
they
met
with
a
loving
embrace
embrace
a
strange
man
carlyle
all
the
blood
in
lady
isabel
s
body
rushed
to
her
brain
was
she
his
second
wife
false
to
him
more
shamelessly
false
than
even
herself
had
been
inasmuch
as
she
had
had
the
grace
to
quit
him
and
east
lynne
before
as
the
servant
girls
say
when
they
change
their
sweethearts
taking
up
with
another
the
positive
conviction
that
such
was
the
case
seized
firm
hold
upon
her
fancy
her
thoughts
were
in
a
tumult
her
mind
was
a
chaos
was
there
any
small
corner
of
rejoicing
in
her
heart
that
it
was
so
and
yet
what
was
it
to
her
it
could
not
alter
by
one
iota
her
own
position
it
could
not
restore
to
her
the
love
she
had
forfeited
coupled
lovingly
together
they
were
now
sauntering
up
the
walk
the
sailor
s
arm
thrown
round
the
waist
of
carlyle
oh
the
shameless
woman
ay
she
could
be
bitter
enough
upon
graceless
doings
when
enacted
by
another
but
what
was
her
astonishment
when
she
saw
carlyle
advance
and
that
his
appearance
caused
not
the
slightest
change
in
their
gracelessness
for
the
sailor
s
arm
was
not
withdrawn
two
or
three
minutes
they
stood
the
three
talking
together
in
a
group
then
the
were
exchanged
the
sailor
left
them
and
carlyle
his
own
arm
lovingly
pressed
where
the
other
s
had
been
withdrew
with
his
wife
the
truth
that
it
was
barbara
s
brother
dashed
to
the
mind
of
lady
isabel
was
i
mad
she
cried
with
a
hollow
laugh
she
false
to
him
no
no
that
fate
was
reserved
for
me
alone
she
followed
them
to
the
house
she
glanced
in
at
the
windows
of
the
lights
and
fire
were
in
the
room
but
the
curtains
and
windows
were
not
closed
for
the
night
for
it
was
through
those
windows
that
carlyle
and
his
wife
had
passed
in
and
out
on
their
visits
to
the
covered
walk
there
they
were
alone
in
their
happiness
and
she
stopped
to
glance
in
upon
it
lord
mount
severn
had
departed
for
london
to
be
down
again
early
in
the
week
the
tea
was
on
the
table
but
barbara
had
not
begun
to
make
it
she
sat
on
the
sofa
by
the
fire
her
face
with
its
ever
loving
gaze
upon
it
turned
up
to
her
husband
s
he
stood
near
was
talking
with
apparent
earnestness
and
looking
down
at
barbara
another
moment
and
a
smile
crossed
his
lips
the
same
sweet
smile
so
often
bent
upon
her
in
the
bygone
days
yes
they
were
together
in
their
unclouded
happiness
and
she
she
turned
away
toward
her
own
lonely
sick
and
faint
at
heart
ball
treadman
as
the
brass
plate
on
their
office
door
intimated
were
conveyancers
and
attorneys
at
law
treadman
who
attended
chiefly
to
the
conveyancing
lived
at
the
office
with
his
family
ball
a
bachelor
lived
away
lawyer
ball
west
lynne
styled
him
not
a
young
bachelor
midway
he
may
have
been
between
forty
and
fifty
a
short
stout
man
with
a
keen
face
and
green
eyes
he
took
up
any
practice
that
was
brought
to
him
dirty
odds
and
ends
that
carlyle
would
not
have
touched
with
his
toe
but
as
that
gentleman
had
remarked
he
could
be
honest
and
true
upon
occasion
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
would
be
so
to
richard
hare
to
his
house
on
monday
morning
early
so
as
to
catch
him
before
he
went
out
proceeded
carlyle
a
high
respect
for
carlyle
had
lawyer
ball
as
he
had
had
for
his
father
before
him
many
a
good
turn
had
the
carlyles
done
him
if
only
helping
him
and
his
partner
to
clients
whom
they
were
too
fastidious
to
take
up
but
the
two
carlyle
and
lawyer
ball
did
not
rank
alike
though
their
profession
was
the
same
lawyer
ball
knew
that
they
did
not
and
was
content
to
feel
humble
the
one
was
a
received
gentleman
the
other
was
a
country
attorney
lawyer
ball
was
at
breakfast
when
carlyle
was
shown
in
halloo
carlyle
you
are
here
sit
still
don
t
disturb
yourself
don
t
ring
i
have
the
most
delicious
pate
de
foie
urged
lawyer
ball
who
was
a
regular
gourmand
i
get
em
direct
from
carlyle
resisted
the
offered
dainty
with
a
smile
i
have
come
on
business
said
he
not
to
feast
before
i
enter
upon
it
you
will
give
me
your
word
ball
that
my
communication
shall
be
held
sacred
in
the
event
of
your
not
consenting
to
pursue
it
certainly
i
will
what
business
is
it
some
that
offends
the
delicacy
of
the
carlyle
office
he
added
with
a
laugh
a
client
whom
you
turn
over
to
me
in
your
exclusiveness
it
is
a
client
for
whom
i
can
not
act
but
not
from
the
motives
you
assume
it
concerns
that
affair
of
hallijohn
s
carlyle
continued
bending
forward
and
somewhat
dropping
his
voice
the
lawyer
ball
who
had
just
taken
in
a
delicious
bonne
bouche
of
the
foie
gras
bolted
it
whole
in
his
surprise
why
that
was
enacted
ages
and
ages
ago
it
is
past
and
done
with
he
exclaimed
not
done
with
said
carlyle
circumstances
have
come
to
light
which
tend
to
indicate
that
richard
hare
was
innocent
that
it
was
another
who
committed
the
in
conjunction
with
him
interrupted
the
attorney
no
alone
richard
hare
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
he
was
not
even
present
at
the
do
you
believe
that
asked
lawyer
ball
i
have
believed
it
for
then
who
did
do
it
richard
accuses
one
of
the
name
of
thorn
many
years
back
ten
at
least
i
had
a
meeting
with
richard
hare
and
he
disclosed
certain
facts
to
me
which
if
correct
could
not
fail
to
prove
that
he
was
not
guilty
since
that
period
this
impression
has
been
gradually
confirmed
by
little
and
by
little
trifle
upon
trifle
and
i
would
now
stake
my
life
upon
his
innocence
i
should
long
ago
have
moved
in
this
matter
hit
or
miss
could
i
have
lighted
upon
thorn
but
he
was
not
to
be
found
neither
any
clue
to
him
and
we
now
know
that
this
name
thorn
was
an
assumed
is
he
to
be
found
he
is
found
he
is
at
west
lynne
mark
you
i
don
t
accuse
him
i
do
not
offer
an
opinion
upon
his
guilt
i
only
state
my
belief
in
richard
s
innocence
it
may
have
been
another
who
did
it
neither
richard
nor
thorn
it
was
my
firm
intention
to
take
richard
s
case
up
the
instant
i
saw
my
way
clearly
in
it
and
now
that
that
time
has
come
i
am
debarred
from
doing
what
debars
you
hence
i
come
to
you
continued
carlyle
disregarding
the
question
i
come
on
the
part
of
richard
hare
i
have
seen
him
lately
and
conversed
with
him
i
gave
him
my
reasons
for
not
personally
acting
advised
him
to
apply
to
you
and
promised
to
come
here
and
open
the
matter
will
you
see
richard
in
good
faith
and
hear
his
story
giving
the
understanding
that
he
shall
depart
unmolested
as
he
came
although
you
do
not
decide
to
entertain
the
business
i
ll
give
it
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
freely
returned
the
attorney
i
m
sure
i
don
t
want
to
harm
poor
dick
hare
and
if
he
can
convince
me
of
his
innocence
i
ll
do
my
best
to
establish
of
his
own
tale
you
must
be
the
judge
i
do
not
wish
to
bias
you
i
have
stated
my
belief
in
his
innocence
but
i
repeat
that
i
give
no
opinion
myself
as
to
who
else
may
be
guilty
hear
his
account
and
then
take
up
the
affair
or
not
as
you
may
think
fit
he
would
not
come
to
you
without
your
previous
promise
to
hold
him
harmless
to
be
his
friend
in
short
for
the
time
being
when
i
bear
this
promise
to
him
for
you
my
part
is
i
give
it
to
you
in
all
honor
carlyle
tell
dick
he
has
nothing
to
fear
from
me
quite
the
contrary
for
if
i
can
befriend
him
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
it
and
i
won
t
spare
trouble
what
can
possibly
be
your
objection
to
act
for
him
my
objection
applies
not
to
richard
i
would
willingly
appear
for
him
but
i
will
not
take
proceedings
against
the
man
he
accuses
if
that
man
is
to
be
denounced
and
brought
before
justice
i
will
hold
neither
act
nor
part
in
the
words
aroused
the
curiosity
of
lawyer
ball
and
he
began
to
turn
over
all
persons
likely
and
unlikely
in
his
mind
never
according
to
usage
giving
a
suspicion
to
the
right
one
i
can
not
fathom
you
you
will
do
that
better
possibly
when
richard
shall
have
made
his
it
s
it
s
never
his
own
father
that
he
accuses
justice
hare
your
wits
must
be
well
so
they
must
to
give
utterance
to
so
preposterous
a
notion
acquiesced
the
attorney
pushing
back
his
chair
and
throwing
his
breakfast
napkin
on
the
carpet
but
i
don
t
know
a
soul
you
could
object
to
go
against
except
the
justice
what
s
anybody
else
in
west
lynne
to
you
in
comparison
to
restoring
dick
hare
to
his
fair
fame
i
give
it
so
do
i
for
the
present
said
carlyle
as
he
rose
and
now
about
the
ways
and
means
for
your
meeting
this
poor
fellow
where
can
you
see
him
is
he
at
west
lynne
no
but
i
can
get
a
message
conveyed
to
him
and
he
could
when
if
you
then
let
him
come
here
to
this
house
he
will
be
perfectly
so
be
it
my
part
is
now
over
concluded
carlyle
and
with
a
few
more
preliminary
words
he
departed
lawyer
ball
looked
after
him
it
s
a
queer
business
one
would
think
dick
accuses
some
old
flame
of
carlyle
s
some
demoiselle
or
dame

chapter

the
world
turned
upside
down
on
monday
evening
the
interview
between
lawyer
ball
and
richard
hare
took
place
with
some
difficulty
would
the
lawyer
believe
his
tale
not
as
to
its
broad
details
he
saw
that
he
might
give
credit
to
them
but
as
to
the
accusation
against
sir
francis
levison
richard
persisted
mentioned
every
minute
particular
he
could
think
of
his
meeting
him
the
night
of
the
elopement
in
bean
lane
his
meetings
with
him
again
in
london
and
sir
francis
s
evident
fear
of
him
and
thence
pursuit
and
the
previous
saturday
night
s
recognition
at
the
door
of
the
raven
not
forgetting
to
tell
of
the
anonymous
letter
received
by
justice
hare
the
morning
that
richard
was
in
hiding
at
carlyle
s
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
world
it
had
been
sent
by
francis
levison
to
frighten
hare
into
dispatching
him
out
of
west
lynne
had
richard
taken
refuge
in
his
father
s
home
none
had
more
cause
to
keep
dick
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
justice
than
francis
levison
i
believe
what
you
say
i
believe
all
you
say
richard
touching
thorn
debated
the
attorney
but
it
s
next
to
impossible
to
take
in
so
astounding
a
fact
as
that
he
is
sir
francis
you
can
satisfy
yourself
of
the
fact
from
other
lips
than
mine
said
richard
otway
bethel
could
testify
to
it
if
he
would
though
i
doubt
his
willingness
but
there
s
ebenezer
what
does
he
know
about
it
asked
the
attorney
in
surprise
ebenezer
james
is
in
our
office
at
he
saw
thorn
often
enough
in
those
days
and
has
i
hear
recognized
him
as
levison
you
had
better
inquire
of
him
should
you
object
to
take
cause
against
levison
not
a
bit
of
it
let
me
be
assured
that
i
am
upon
safe
grounds
as
to
the
identity
of
the
man
and
i
ll
proceed
in
it
forthwith
levison
is
an
scoundrel
as
levison
and
deserves
hanging
i
will
send
for
james
at
once
and
hear
what
he
says
he
concluded
after
a
pause
of
consideration
richard
hare
started
wildly
up
not
while
i
am
here
he
must
not
see
me
for
heaven
s
sake
consider
the
peril
to
me
ball
pooh
pooh
laughed
the
attorney
do
you
suppose
i
have
but
this
one
we
don
t
let
cats
into
cages
where
canary
birds
are
ebenezer
james
returned
with
the
messenger
dispatched
after
him
you
ll
be
sure
to
find
him
at
the
singing
saloon
ball
had
said
and
there
the
gentleman
was
found
is
it
any
copying
sir
wanted
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
cried
james
when
he
came
in
no
replied
the
attorney
i
wish
a
question
or
two
answered
that
s
all
did
you
ever
know
sir
francis
levison
to
go
by
any
name
but
his
own
yes
sir
he
has
gone
by
the
name
of
a
pause
when
was
this
it
was
the
autumn
when
hallijohn
was
killed
thorn
used
to
be
prowling
about
there
in
an
evening
in
the
wood
and
at
the
cottage
i
what
did
he
prowl
for
ebenezer
james
laughed
for
the
same
reason
that
several
more
did
i
for
one
he
was
sweet
upon
afy
where
was
he
living
at
the
time
i
never
remember
him
in
west
he
was
not
at
west
lynne
sir
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
to
take
precious
good
care
that
west
lynne
and
he
kept
separate
a
splendid
horse
he
rode
a
thoroughbred
and
he
used
to
come
galloping
into
the
wood
at
dusk
get
over
his
chat
with
miss
afy
mount
and
gallop
away
where
to
where
did
he
come
from
from
somewhere
toward
swainson
a
ten
mile
s
ride
afy
used
to
say
he
had
now
that
he
has
appeared
here
in
his
own
plumage
of
course
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
and
not
be
at
much
fault
for
the
exact
and
where
s
that
asked
the
lawyer
levison
park
said
ebenezer
there
s
little
doubt
he
was
stopping
at
his
uncle
s
and
you
know
that
is
close
to
lawyer
ball
thought
things
were
becoming
clearer
or
darker
whatever
you
may
please
to
call
it
he
paused
again
and
then
put
a
question
impressively
james
have
you
any
doubt
whatever
or
shadow
of
doubt
that
sir
francis
levison
is
the
same
man
you
know
as
thorn
sir
have
i
any
doubt
that
you
are
ball
or
that
i
am
eb
james
retorted
ebenezer
i
am
as
certain
of
that
man
s
identity
as
i
am
of
are
you
ready
to
swear
to
that
fact
in
a
court
of
justice
ready
and
willing
in
any
court
in
the
world
if
i
am
called
very
well
you
may
go
back
to
your
singing
club
now
keep
a
silent
tongue
in
your
all
close
sir
answered
ebenezer
james
far
into
the
middle
of
the
night
sat
lawyer
ball
and
richard
hare
the
former
chiefly
occupied
in
taking
notes
of
richard
s
statement
it
s
half
a
crochet
this
objection
of
carlyle
s
to
interfere
with
levison
suddenly
uttered
richard
in
the
midst
of
some
desultory
conversation
don
t
you
think
so
ball
the
lawyer
pursed
up
his
lips
um
a
delicate
point
carlyle
was
always
fastidiously
honorable
i
should
go
at
him
thunder
and
fury
in
his
place
but
i
and
carlyle
are
the
following
day
tuesday
ball
was
much
occupied
putting
to
use
nearly
ebenezer
james
words
that
and
that
together
later
in
the
day
he
took
a
journey
to
levison
park
ferreted
out
some
information
and
came
home
again
on
that
same
day
at
evening
richard
departed
for
liverpool
he
was
done
with
for
the
present
and
carlyle
being
as
before
alone
cognizant
of
his
address
wednesday
morning
witnessed
the
arrival
again
of
the
earl
of
mount
severn
lord
vane
too
the
latter
ought
to
have
gone
back
to
eton
but
he
had
teased
and
prayed
to
be
allowed
to
see
the
fun
out
meaning
the
election
and
that
devil
s
discomfiture
when
he
finds
himself
beaten
he
surreptitiously
added
behind
his
father
s
back
who
was
a
great
stickler
for
the
boy
s
always
being
so
the
earl
had
yielded
they
arrived
as
before
about
having
traveled
all
night
subsequently
they
and
carlyle
walked
into
west
lynne
together
west
lynne
was
alive
and
astir
the
election
was
to
come
off
that
week
and
people
made
it
their
business
to
be
in
a
bustle
over
it
collectively
and
individually
carlyle
s
committee
sat
at
the
buck
s
head
and
the
traffic
in
and
out
was
enough
to
wear
the
stones
away
the
bench
of
justices
were
remarkably
warm
over
it
neglecting
the
judicial
business
and
showing
themselves
at
the
buck
s
head
windows
in
purple
and
scarlet
streamers
i
will
be
with
you
in
ten
minutes
said
carlyle
withdrawing
his
arm
from
lord
mount
severn
s
as
they
approached
his
office
but
i
must
go
in
and
read
my
so
the
earl
went
on
to
the
buck
s
head
and
lord
vane
took
a
foot
canter
down
to
the
raven
to
reconnoiter
it
outside
he
was
uncommonly
fond
of
planting
himself
where
sir
francis
levison
s
eyes
were
sure
to
fall
upon
him
which
eyes
were
immediately
dropped
while
the
young
gentleman
s
would
be
fixed
in
an
audacious
stare
being
lord
vane
or
it
may
be
more
correct
to
say
being
the
earl
of
mount
severn
s
son
and
under
control
he
was
debarred
from
dancing
and
jeering
after
the
yellow
candidate
as
the
unwashed
gentry
of
his
own
age
indulged
in
but
his
tongue
and
his
feet
itched
to
do
it
carlyle
took
his
seat
in
his
private
room
opened
his
letters
assorted
them
marked
on
the
back
of
some
what
was
to
be
the
purport
of
their
answer
and
then
called
in
dill
carlyle
put
the
letters
in
his
hand
gave
some
rapid
instructions
and
rose
you
are
in
a
hurry
archibald
they
want
me
at
the
buck
s
head
why
a
curious
incident
occurred
to
me
last
evening
sir
i
was
an
witness
to
a
dispute
between
levison
and
otway
indeed
carelessly
replied
carlyle
who
was
busy
at
the
time
looking
for
something
in
the
deep
drawer
of
the
desk
and
what
i
heard
would
go
far
to
hang
levison
if
not
bethel
as
sure
as
we
are
here
archibald
they
hold
the
secret
of
hallijohn
s
murder
it
appears
that
levison
stop
interposed
carlyle
i
would
prefer
not
to
hear
this
levison
may
have
murdered
him
but
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
neither
shall
i
make
it
old
dill
felt
checkmated
meanwhile
richard
hare
suffers
archibald
he
observed
in
a
remonstrating
tone
i
am
aware
he
is
it
right
that
the
innocent
should
suffer
for
the
guilty
no
very
wrong
but
the
case
is
all
too
if
some
one
would
take
up
richard
hare
s
cause
now
he
might
be
proved
innocent
added
the
old
man
with
a
wistful
look
at
carlyle
it
is
being
taken
up
a
pause
and
a
glad
look
that
s
the
best
news
i
have
had
for
many
a
day
sir
but
my
evidence
will
be
necessary
to
your
case
levison
i
m
not
taking
up
the
case
you
must
carry
your
news
elsewhere
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
i
then
who
is
taking
it
up
echoed
dill
in
astonishment
ball
he
has
had
a
meeting
with
richard
and
is
now
acting
for
him
under
the
dill
s
eyes
sparkled
is
he
going
to
prosecute
archibald
i
tell
you
i
know
nothing
i
will
know
nothing
when
the
affair
comes
out
to
the
public
if
it
ever
does
come
out
i
shall
share
in
the
information
dill
and
that
is
ah
well
i
can
understand
but
i
shall
go
on
to
their
office
at
once
archibald
and
inform
them
of
what
i
overheard
spoke
old
dill
in
vehement
decision
that
is
not
my
affair
either
laughed
carlyle
it
is
yours
but
remember
if
you
do
go
it
is
ball
not
waiting
only
to
give
certain
orders
to
the
head
clerk
dill
proceeded
to
the
office
of
ball
treadman
a
full
hour
was
he
closeted
there
with
the
senior
partner
not
until
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
did
the
justices
take
their
seats
on
the
bench
scarcely
were
they
seated
when
lawyer
ball
bustled
in
and
craved
a
secret
hearing
his
application
was
of
the
last
importance
he
promised
but
that
the
ends
of
justice
might
not
be
defeated
it
was
necessary
their
worships
should
entertain
it
in
private
he
therefore
craved
the
bench
to
accord
it
to
him
the
bench
consulted
looked
wise
and
possibly
possessing
some
latent
curiosity
themselves
upon
the
point
graciously
acceded
they
adjourned
to
a
private
room
and
it
was
full
four
before
they
came
out
of
it
very
long
faces
scared
and
grim
were
their
worships
as
if
lawyer
ball
s
communication
had
both
perplexed
and
confounded
them
this
is
the
afternoon
we
are
to
meet
martin
at
papa
s
office
william
carlyle
had
suddenly
exclaimed
that
day
at
dinner
do
we
walk
in
madame
vine
i
do
not
know
william
carlyle
is
going
to
take
no
she
is
not
you
are
going
to
take
a
flush
passed
over
lady
isabel
s
face
at
the
bare
thought
though
she
did
not
believe
it
she
go
to
carlyle
s
office
mrs
carlyle
told
me
herself
that
she
should
take
you
was
the
reply
all
i
know
is
mamma
told
me
this
morning
you
would
take
me
to
west
lynne
persisted
william
the
discussion
was
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
carlyle
interrupted
and
decided
also
madame
vine
she
said
you
will
be
ready
at
three
o
clock
to
go
in
with
william
lady
isabel
s
heart
beat
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
should
go
with
him
yourself
i
know
i
did
i
intended
to
do
so
but
i
heard
this
morning
that
some
friends
from
a
distance
are
coming
this
afternoon
to
call
upon
me
therefore
i
shall
not
go
how
she
lady
isabel
wished
that
she
dare
say
also
i
shall
not
go
out
but
that
might
not
be
well
she
must
go
through
with
it
as
she
had
to
go
through
with
the
rest
william
rode
his
pony
into
west
lynne
the
groom
attending
to
take
it
back
again
he
was
to
walk
home
with
madame
vine
who
walked
both
ways
carlyle
was
not
in
when
they
arrived
at
the
office
the
boy
went
boldly
on
to
the
private
room
leaving
madame
vine
to
follow
him
presently
carlyle
appeared
he
was
talking
to
dill
who
followed
him
oh
you
are
here
madame
vine
i
left
word
that
you
were
to
go
into
miss
carlyle
s
did
i
not
leave
word
dill
not
with
me
i
forgot
it
then
i
meant
to
do
so
what
is
the
time
he
looked
at
his
watch
ten
minutes
to
four
did
the
doctor
say
at
what
hour
he
should
call
carlyle
added
to
madame
vine
not
precisely
i
gathered
that
it
would
be
very
early
in
the
here
he
is
exclaimed
carlyle
with
alacrity
as
he
went
into
the
hall
she
supposed
he
alluded
to
the
physician
supposed
he
had
seen
him
pass
the
window
their
entrance
together
woke
up
william
well
said
the
doctor
who
was
a
little
man
with
a
bald
head
and
how
fares
it
with
my
young
patient
bon
jour
bon
jour
monsieur
responded
she
she
wished
everybody
would
address
her
in
french
and
take
her
for
french
there
seemed
less
chance
of
recognition
she
would
have
to
speak
in
good
plain
english
however
if
she
must
carry
on
conversation
with
the
doctor
beyond
a
familiar
phrase
or
two
he
was
something
like
justice
hare
nong
parley
fronsay
me
and
how
does
the
oil
get
on
asked
the
doctor
of
william
as
he
drew
him
to
the
light
it
is
nicer
now
than
it
used
to
be
eh
no
said
william
it
is
nastier
than
martin
looked
at
the
boy
felt
his
pulse
his
skin
listened
to
his
breathing
there
said
he
presently
you
may
sit
down
and
have
your
nap
i
wish
i
might
have
something
to
drink
i
am
very
thirsty
may
i
ring
for
some
water
papa
go
and
find
your
aunt
s
maid
and
ask
her
for
some
said
carlyle
ask
her
for
milk
called
out
martin
not
away
went
william
carlyle
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
window
martin
folded
his
arms
before
it
lady
isabel
stood
near
the
latter
the
broad
full
light
was
cast
upon
all
but
the
thick
veil
hid
lady
isabel
s
face
it
was
not
often
she
could
be
caught
without
that
veil
for
she
seemed
to
wear
her
bonnet
at
all
sorts
of
seasonable
and
unseasonable
times
what
is
your
opinion
doctor
asked
carlyle
well
began
the
doctor
in
a
very
professional
tone
the
boy
is
certainly
delicate
but
stay
martin
was
the
interruption
spoken
in
a
low
impressive
voice
you
will
deal
candidly
with
me
i
must
know
the
truth
without
disguise
tell
it
me
martin
paused
the
truth
is
not
always
palatable
true
but
for
that
very
reason
all
the
more
necessary
let
me
hear
the
worst
and
the
child
has
no
mother
you
know
to
be
shocked
with
i
fear
that
it
will
be
the
death
ay
the
seeds
of
consumption
must
have
been
inherent
in
him
they
are
showing
out
too
is
there
no
hope
for
the
child
martin
looked
at
him
you
bade
me
give
you
the
nothing
else
nothing
but
the
truth
returned
carlyle
his
tone
one
of
mingled
pain
and
command
then
there
is
none
no
hope
whatever
the
lungs
are
extensively
and
how
long
that
i
can
not
say
interrupted
the
doctor
divining
what
the
next
question
was
to
be
he
may
linger
on
for
months
for
a
year
it
may
even
be
or
a
very
short
period
may
see
the
termination
don
t
worry
him
with
any
more
lessons
and
stuff
of
learning
he
ll
never
want
the
doctor
cast
his
eyes
on
the
governess
as
he
spoke
the
injunction
concerned
her
as
much
as
it
did
carlyle
and
the
doctor
started
for
he
thought
she
was
fainting
her
face
had
become
so
ghastly
white
he
could
see
it
through
her
veil
you
are
ill
madame
you
are
ill
trouve
malade
don
t
you
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
her
trembling
lips
that
would
not
obey
her
martin
in
his
concern
pulled
off
the
blue
spectacles
she
caught
them
from
him
with
one
hand
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
hid
her
face
with
the
other
carlyle
scarcely
understanding
the
scuffle
came
forward
are
you
ill
madame
vine
she
was
putting
her
spectacles
under
her
veil
her
face
whiter
than
ever
pray
do
not
interrupt
your
conversation
to
pay
attention
to
me
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
both
i
am
subject
to
slight
spasms
and
they
do
make
me
look
ill
for
the
moment
it
has
passed
the
doctor
turned
from
her
carlyle
resumed
his
place
by
the
window
what
should
be
the
treatment
asked
the
latter
almost
anything
you
please
that
the
boy
himself
likes
let
him
play
or
rest
ride
or
walk
eat
and
drink
or
let
it
alone
it
can
not
make
much
doctor
you
yield
it
as
a
last
hope
very
martin
shook
his
head
i
speak
as
i
know
you
insisted
on
having
my
true
a
warmer
climate
suggested
carlyle
eagerly
the
idea
crossing
his
mind
it
might
prolong
the
end
for
a
little
while
a
few
weeks
perhaps
avert
it
it
could
not
and
who
could
take
him
you
could
not
go
and
he
has
no
mother
no
i
should
not
advise
i
wish
you
would
see
wainwright
with
reference
to
i
have
seen
him
i
met
him
this
afternoon
by
chance
and
told
him
my
opinion
how
is
carlyle
pretty
well
she
is
not
in
robust
health
you
are
aware
just
martin
smiled
these
things
will
happen
carlyle
has
a
thoroughly
good
constitution
a
far
stronger
one
than
than
than
what
said
carlyle
wondering
why
he
hesitated
you
must
grant
me
pardon
i
may
as
well
finish
now
i
have
begun
but
i
was
not
thinking
when
i
spoke
she
is
stronger
than
was
lady
isabel
i
must
be
off
to
catch
the
six
you
will
come
over
from
time
to
time
to
east
lynne
to
see
william
if
you
wish
it
it
may
be
a
satisfaction
perhaps
bon
jour
lady
isabel
bowed
to
him
as
he
left
the
room
with
carlyle
how
fond
that
french
governess
of
yours
is
of
the
boy
the
doctor
whispered
as
they
crossed
the
hall
i
detected
it
when
she
brought
him
to
lynneborough
and
you
saw
her
just
now
that
emotion
was
all
because
he
could
not
live
carlyle
grasped
his
hand
doctor
i
wish
you
could
save
him
he
passionately
uttered
ah
carlyle
if
we
humble
mites
of
human
doctors
could
but
keep
those
whom
it
is
the
great
physician
s
pleasure
to
take
how
we
should
be
run
after
there
s
hidden
mercy
remember
in
the
darkest
cloud
farewell
my
carlyle
returned
to
the
room
he
approached
lady
isabel
looking
down
upon
her
as
she
sat
not
that
he
could
see
much
of
her
face
these
are
grievous
tidings
but
you
were
more
prepared
for
them
i
fancy
than
i
she
started
suddenly
up
approached
the
window
and
looked
out
as
if
she
saw
somebody
passing
whom
she
would
gaze
at
all
of
emotion
was
stirred
up
within
her
her
temples
throbbed
her
throat
beat
her
breath
became
hysterical
could
she
bear
thus
to
hold
confidential
converse
with
him
over
the
state
of
their
child
she
pulled
off
her
gloves
for
coolness
to
her
burning
hands
she
wiped
the
moisture
from
her
pale
forehead
she
struggled
manfully
for
calmness
what
excuse
could
she
offer
to
carlyle
i
had
begun
to
like
the
boy
so
very
much
sir
she
said
half
turning
round
and
the
doctor
s
fiat
too
plainly
pronounced
has
given
me
pain
pain
to
again
carlyle
approached
her
following
close
up
to
where
she
stood
you
are
very
kind
thus
to
feel
an
interest
in
my
she
did
not
answer
here
papa
papa
i
want
you
cried
william
breaking
into
the
room
let
me
walk
home
with
you
are
you
going
to
walk
how
could
he
find
it
in
his
heart
to
deny
anything
to
the
child
then
very
well
he
said
stay
here
till
i
come
for
we
are
going
home
with
papa
proclaimed
william
to
madame
vine
madame
vine
did
not
relish
the
news
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
in
a
very
short
time
carlyle
appeared
and
they
set
off
he
holding
william
s
hand
madame
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
child
where
s
william
vane
papa
asked
the
boy
he
has
gone
on
with
lord
mount
scarcely
had
the
words
been
spoken
when
some
one
came
bolting
out
of
the
and
met
them
face
to
face
almost
ran
against
them
in
fact
creating
some
hindrance
the
man
looked
confused
and
slunk
off
into
the
gutter
and
you
will
not
wonder
that
he
did
when
you
hear
that
it
was
francis
levison
william
child
like
turned
his
head
to
gaze
at
the
intruder
i
would
not
be
an
ugly
bad
man
like
him
for
the
world
quoth
he
as
he
turned
his
back
again
would
you
papa
carlyle
did
not
answer
and
isabel
cast
an
involuntary
glance
upon
him
from
her
white
face
his
was
impassive
save
that
a
cast
of
ineffable
scorn
marred
the
delicate
beauty
of
his
lips
if
humiliation
for
the
past
had
never
wrung
lady
isabel
s
heart
before
it
would
have
wrung
it
then
at
justice
hare
s
gate
they
encountered
that
gentleman
who
appeared
to
be
standing
there
to
give
himself
an
airing
william
caught
sight
of
hare
seated
on
the
garden
bench
outside
the
window
and
ran
to
kiss
her
all
the
children
loved
hare
the
justice
was
looking
not
pale
that
would
not
be
a
term
half
strong
enough
but
yellow
the
curls
of
his
best
wig
were
limp
and
all
his
pomposity
appeared
to
have
gone
out
of
him
i
say
carlyle
what
on
earth
s
this
cried
he
in
a
tone
that
for
him
was
wonderfully
subdued
and
meek
i
was
not
on
the
bench
this
afternoon
but
pinner
has
been
telling
me
of
an
application
that
was
made
to
them
in
private
it
s
not
true
you
know
it
can
t
be
it
s
too
a
tale
what
do
you
know
about
it
nothing
said
carlyle
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
of
i
have
been
privy
to
no
it
seems
they
want
to
make
out
now
that
dick
never
murdered
hallijohn
proceeded
the
justice
in
a
half
whisper
glancing
round
as
if
to
be
sure
that
there
were
no
amidst
the
trees
oh
said
carlyle
but
that
levison
did
levison
carlyle
made
no
reply
save
by
a
gesture
his
face
more
impassive
than
before
not
so
another
face
beside
him
a
fair
face
that
turned
white
again
with
emotion
as
she
listened
but
it
can
t
be
you
know
it
can
t
i
so
far
as
richard
s
innocence
goes
of
that
i
have
long
been
convinced
spoke
carlyle
and
that
levison
s
guilty
returned
the
justice
opening
his
eyes
in
puzzled
wonderment
i
have
no
opinion
upon
that
point
was
the
cold
rejoinder
it
s
impossible
i
say
dick
can
t
be
innocent
you
may
as
well
tell
me
that
the
world
s
turned
upside
it
is
sometimes
i
think
that
richard
was
not
the
guilty
man
will
be
proved
yet
justice
in
the
broad
face
of
if
if
that
other
did
do
it
i
should
think
you
d
take
the
warrant
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
and
capture
him
i
would
not
touch
him
with
a
pair
of
tongs
spoke
carlyle
his
lips
curling
again
if
the
man
goes
to
his
punishment
he
goes
but
i
do
not
help
him
on
his
road
can
dick
be
innocent
mused
the
justice
returning
to
the
thought
which
so
troubled
his
mind
then
why
has
he
kept
away
why
did
he
not
come
back
and
say
so
that
you
might
deliver
him
up
justice
you
know
you
took
an
oath
to
do
the
justice
looked
green
and
remarkably
humble
oh
but
carlyle
impulsively
spoke
he
the
thought
occurring
to
him
what
an
awful
revenge
this
would
have
been
for
you
on
somebody
had
she
lived
how
her
false
step
would
have
come
home
to
her
now
false
steps
come
home
to
most
people
responded
carlyle
as
he
took
william
by
the
hand
who
then
ran
up
and
lifting
his
hat
to
hare
in
the
distance
he
walked
on
she
lady
isabel
walked
on
too
by
the
side
of
the
child
as
before
walked
on
with
a
shivering
frame
and
a
heart
sick
unto
death
the
justice
looked
after
her
his
mind
unoccupied
he
was
in
a
maze
of
bewilderment
richard
innocent
richard
whom
he
had
striven
to
pursue
to
a
shameful
end
and
that
other
the
guilty
one
the
world
was
turning
upside
down
chapter
xxxix
carlyle
in
full
dress
afy
also
merrily
rose
west
lynne
on
thursday
morning
merrily
rang
out
the
bells
clashing
and
chiming
the
street
was
alive
with
people
the
windows
were
crowded
with
heads
something
unusual
was
astir
it
was
the
day
of
the
nomination
of
the
two
candidates
and
everybody
took
the
opportunity
to
make
a
holiday
ten
o
clock
was
the
hour
named
but
before
that
hour
struck
west
lynne
was
crammed
the
country
people
had
come
in
thick
and
threefold
rich
and
poor
people
of
note
and
people
of
none
voters
and
all
eager
to
mix
themselves
up
with
the
day
s
proceedings
you
see
the
notorious
fact
of
sir
francis
levison
s
having
come
forward
to
oppose
carlyle
caused
greater
interest
in
this
election
than
is
usual
even
in
small
country
places
and
that
need
not
be
barbara
drove
in
her
carriage
the
two
children
with
her
and
the
governess
the
governess
said
she
preferred
to
remain
at
home
barbara
would
not
hear
of
it
almost
felt
inclined
to
resent
it
as
a
slight
besides
if
she
took
no
interest
in
carlyle
she
must
go
to
take
care
of
lucy
she
barbara
would
be
too
much
occupied
to
look
after
children
so
madame
vine
perforce
stepped
into
the
barouche
and
sat
opposite
to
carlyle
her
thick
veil
shading
her
features
and
their
pallor
contrasting
with
the
blue
spectacles
they
alighted
at
the
residence
of
miss
carlyle
quite
a
gathering
was
already
there
lady
and
miss
dobede
the
herberts
hare
and
many
others
for
the
house
was
in
a
good
spot
for
seeing
the
fun
and
all
the
people
were
eager
to
testify
their
respect
to
carlyle
in
contradiction
to
that
other
one
miss
carlyle
was
in
full
rig
a
brocaded
dress
and
a
bow
in
front
of
it
the
size
of
a
pumpkin
it
was
about
the
only
occasion
in
all
miss
carlyle
s
life
that
she
deemed
it
necessary
to
attire
herself
beyond
common
barbara
wore
no
bow
but
she
exhibited
a
splendid
bouquet
of
flowers
carlyle
had
himself
given
it
to
her
that
morning
carlyle
saw
them
all
at
the
windows
of
the
large
upper
and
came
in
he
was
then
on
his
way
to
the
shaking
hands
laughter
hearty
and
hasty
good
wishes
and
he
quitted
the
room
again
barbara
stole
after
him
for
a
sweeter
farewell
god
bless
you
and
prosper
you
archibald
my
dearest
the
business
of
the
day
began
carlyle
was
proposed
by
sir
john
dobede
and
seconded
by
herbert
lord
mount
severn
than
whom
not
a
busier
man
was
there
would
willingly
have
been
proposer
and
seconder
too
but
he
had
no
local
influence
in
the
place
sir
francis
levison
was
proposed
also
by
two
gentlemen
of
standing
the
show
of
hands
was
declared
to
be
in
favor
of
carlyle
it
just
was
in
favor
of
him
about
twenty
to
one
upon
which
the
baronet
s
friends
demanded
a
poll
then
all
was
bustle
and
scuffle
and
confusion
every
one
tearing
away
to
the
hustings
which
had
been
fixed
in
a
convenient
spot
the
hall
not
affording
the
accommodation
necessary
for
a
poll
candidates
and
proposers
and
seconders
and
gentlemen
and
officers
and
mob
hustling
and
jostling
each
other
carlyle
was
linked
with
sir
john
dobede
sir
john
s
arm
was
within
lord
mount
severn
s
but
as
to
order
it
was
impossible
to
observe
any
to
gain
the
place
they
had
to
pass
the
house
of
miss
carlyle
young
vane
who
was
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
of
course
cast
his
eyes
up
to
its
lined
windows
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
carlyle
and
honor
forever
shouted
he
the
ladies
laughed
and
nodded
and
shook
their
handkerchiefs
and
displayed
their
scarlet
and
purple
colors
the
crowd
took
up
the
shout
till
the
very
air
echoed
with
it
carlyle
and
honor
forever
barbara
s
tears
were
falling
but
she
smiled
through
them
at
one
pair
of
loving
eyes
which
sought
out
hers
a
galaxy
of
beauty
whispered
drake
in
the
ear
of
sir
francis
how
the
women
rally
round
him
i
tell
you
what
levison
you
and
the
government
were
stupid
to
go
on
with
the
contest
and
i
said
so
days
ago
you
have
no
more
chance
against
carlyle
than
that
bit
of
straw
has
against
the
wind
you
ought
to
have
withdrawn
in
like
a
coward
angrily
returned
sir
francis
no
i
ll
go
on
with
it
to
the
last
though
i
do
get
how
lovely
his
wife
is
observed
drake
his
admiring
eyes
cast
up
at
barbara
i
say
levison
was
the
first
one
as
charming
sir
francis
looked
perfectly
savage
the
allusion
did
not
please
him
but
ere
another
word
could
be
spoken
some
one
in
the
garb
of
a
policeman
who
had
wound
his
way
through
the
crowd
laid
his
hand
upon
the
baronet
sir
francis
levison
you
are
my
nothing
worse
than
debt
occurred
at
that
moment
to
the
mind
of
sir
francis
but
that
was
quite
enough
and
he
turned
purple
with
rage
your
hands
off
vermin
how
dare
you
a
quick
movement
a
slight
click
a
hustle
from
the
wondering
crowd
more
immediately
around
and
the
handcuffs
were
on
utter
amazement
alone
prevented
drake
from
knocking
down
the
policeman
a
dozen
vituperating
tongues
assailed
him
i
m
sorry
to
do
it
in
this
public
place
and
manner
spoke
the
officer
partly
to
sir
francis
partly
to
the
gentlemen
around
but
i
couldn
t
come
across
you
last
night
do
as
i
would
and
the
warrant
has
been
in
my
hands
since
five
o
clock
yesterday
afternoon
sir
francis
levison
i
arrest
you
for
the
wilful
murder
of
george
the
crowd
fell
back
the
crowd
was
paralyzed
with
consternation
the
word
was
passed
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
and
back
and
across
again
and
the
excitement
grew
high
the
ladies
looking
from
miss
carlyle
s
windows
saw
what
had
happened
though
they
could
not
divine
the
cause
some
of
them
turned
pale
at
sight
of
the
handcuffs
and
mary
pinner
an
excitable
girl
fell
into
a
screaming
fit
pale
what
was
their
gentle
paleness
compared
with
the
frightfully
livid
one
of
francis
levison
his
agitation
was
pitiable
to
witness
his
face
a
terror
to
look
upon
once
or
twice
he
gasped
as
if
in
an
agony
and
then
his
eyes
happened
to
fall
on
otway
bethel
who
stood
near
shorn
of
his
adornments
which
might
not
be
thought
adornments
upon
paper
the
following
was
the
sentence
that
burst
involuntarily
from
his
lips
you
hound
it
is
you
who
have
done
this
no
by
whether
otway
bethel
was
about
to
swear
by
jupiter
or
juno
never
was
decided
the
sentence
being
cut
ignominiously
short
at
the
above
two
words
another
policeman
in
the
summary
manner
exercised
towards
sir
francis
had
clapped
a
pair
of
handcuffs
upon
him
mr
otway
bethel
i
arrest
you
as
an
accomplice
in
the
murder
of
george
you
may
be
sure
that
the
whole
assembly
was
arrested
too
stood
with
eager
gaze
and
open
ears
colonel
bethel
quitting
the
flashed
into
those
of
the
yellows
he
knew
his
nephew
was
graceless
enough
but
to
see
him
with
a
pair
of
handcuffs
on
what
does
all
this
mean
he
authoritatively
demanded
of
the
officers
it
s
no
fault
of
ours
colonel
we
have
but
executed
the
warrant
answered
one
of
them
the
magistrate
issued
it
yesterday
against
these
two
gentlemen
on
suspicion
of
their
being
concerned
in
the
murder
of
in
conjunction
with
richard
hare
cried
the
astounded
colonel
gazing
from
one
to
the
other
prisoners
and
officers
in
scared
bewilderment
it
s
alleged
now
that
richard
hare
didn
t
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
returned
the
man
it
s
said
he
is
innocent
i
m
sure
i
don
t
i
swear
that
i
am
innocent
passionately
uttered
otway
bethel
well
sir
you
have
only
got
to
prove
it
civilly
rejoined
the
policeman
miss
carlyle
and
lady
isabel
leaned
from
the
window
their
curiosity
too
much
excited
to
remain
silent
longer
hare
was
standing
by
their
side
what
is
the
matter
both
asked
of
the
upturned
faces
immediately
beneath
them
two
the
fine
member
as
wanted
to
be
and
young
bethel
be
arrested
for
murder
spoke
a
man
s
clear
voice
in
answer
the
tale
runs
as
they
murdered
hallijohn
and
then
laid
it
on
the
shoulders
of
young
dick
hare
who
didn
t
do
it
after
a
faint
wailing
cry
of
startled
pain
and
barbara
flew
to
hare
from
whom
it
proceeded
oh
mamma
my
dear
mamma
take
comfort
do
not
suffer
this
to
agitate
you
to
illness
richard
is
innocent
and
it
will
surely
be
so
proved
archibald
she
added
beckoning
to
her
husband
in
her
alarm
come
if
you
can
and
say
a
word
of
assurance
to
mamma
it
was
impossible
that
carlyle
could
hear
the
words
but
he
could
see
that
his
wife
was
greatly
agitated
and
wanted
him
i
will
be
back
with
you
in
a
few
moments
he
said
to
his
friends
as
he
began
to
elbow
his
way
through
the
crowd
which
made
way
when
they
saw
who
the
elbower
was
into
another
room
away
from
the
gay
visitors
they
got
hare
and
carlyle
locked
the
door
to
keep
them
out
unconsciously
taking
out
the
key
only
himself
and
his
wife
were
with
her
except
madame
vine
in
her
bonnet
who
had
been
dispatched
by
somebody
with
a
bottle
of
smelling
salts
barbara
knelt
at
her
mamma
s
feet
carlyle
leaned
over
her
her
hands
held
sympathizingly
in
his
madame
vine
would
have
escaped
but
the
key
was
gone
oh
archibald
tell
me
the
truth
you
will
not
deceive
me
she
gasped
in
earnest
entreaty
the
cold
dew
gathering
on
her
pale
gentle
face
is
the
time
come
to
prove
my
boy
s
innocence
it
is
it
possible
that
it
can
be
that
false
bad
man
who
is
guilty
from
my
soul
i
believe
him
to
be
replied
carlyle
glancing
round
to
make
sure
that
none
could
hear
the
assertion
save
those
present
but
what
i
say
to
you
and
barbara
i
would
not
say
to
the
world
whatever
be
the
man
s
guilt
i
am
not
his
nemesis
dear
hare
take
courage
take
comfort
happier
days
are
coming
hare
was
weeping
silently
barbara
rose
and
laid
her
mamma
s
head
lovingly
upon
her
bosom
take
care
of
her
my
darling
carlyle
whispered
to
his
wife
don
t
leave
her
for
a
moment
and
don
t
let
that
chattering
crew
in
from
the
next
room
i
beg
your
pardon
his
hand
had
touched
madame
vine
s
neck
in
turning
round
that
is
had
touched
the
jacket
that
encased
it
he
unlocked
the
door
and
regained
the
street
while
madame
vine
sat
down
with
her
beating
and
rebellious
heart
amidst
the
shouts
the
jeers
and
the
escort
of
the
mob
sir
francis
levison
and
otway
bethel
were
lodged
in
the
preparatory
to
their
examination
before
the
magistrates
never
sure
was
so
mortifying
an
interruption
known
so
thought
sir
francis
s
party
and
they
deemed
it
well
after
some
consultation
amongst
themselves
to
withdraw
his
name
as
a
candidate
for
the
membership
that
he
never
had
a
shadow
of
chance
from
the
first
most
of
them
knew
but
there
s
an
incident
yet
to
tell
of
the
election
day
you
have
seen
miss
carlyle
in
her
glory
her
brocaded
silk
standing
on
end
with
richness
her
displayed
colors
her
pride
in
her
noble
brother
but
now
could
you
or
she
which
it
is
more
to
the
purpose
have
divined
who
and
what
was
right
above
her
head
at
an
upper
window
i
know
not
what
the
consequence
would
have
been
no
less
an
eyesore
to
miss
carlyle
than
that
brazen
hussy
afy
hallijohn
smuggled
in
by
miss
carlyle
s
servants
there
she
was
in
full
dress
too
a
checked
sarcenet
flounced
up
to
the
waist
over
a
crinoline
extending
from
here
to
yonder
a
fancy
bonnet
worn
on
the
plait
of
hair
behind
with
a
wreath
and
a
veil
delicate
white
gloves
and
a
swinging
handkerchief
of
lace
redolent
of
musk
it
was
well
for
miss
corny
s
peace
of
mind
ever
after
that
she
remained
in
ignorance
of
that
daring
act
there
stood
afy
bold
as
a
sunflower
exhibiting
herself
and
her
splendor
to
the
admiring
eyes
of
the
mob
below
gentle
and

handsome
man
after
all
quoth
she
to
miss
carlyle
s
maids
when
sir
francis
levison
arrived
opposite
the
house
but
such
a
horrid
creature
was
the
response
and
to
think
that
he
should
come
here
to
oppose
archibald
what
s
that
cried
afy
what
are
they
stopping
for
there
are
two
policemen
there
oh
shrieked
afy
if
they
haven
t
put
handcuffs
on
him
whatever
has
he
done
what
can
he
have
been
up
to
where
who
what
cried
the
servants
bewildered
with
the
crowd
put
handcuffs
on
which
sir
francis
levison
hush
what
is
that
they
say
listening
looking
turning
from
white
to
red
from
red
to
white
afy
stood
but
she
could
make
nothing
of
it
she
could
not
divine
the
cause
of
the
commotion
the
man
s
answer
to
miss
carlyle
and
lady
dobede
clear
though
it
was
did
not
quite
reach
her
ears
what
did
he
say
she
cried
good
heavens
cried
one
of
the
maids
whose
hearing
had
been
quicker
than
afy
s
he
says
they
are
arrested
for
the
wilful
murder
of
hal
your
father
miss
afy
sir
francis
levison
and
otway
what
shrieked
afy
her
eyes
starting
levison
was
the
man
who
did
it
he
says
continued
the
servant
bending
her
ear
to
listen
and
young
richard
hare
he
says
has
been
innocent
all
afy
slowly
gathered
in
the
sense
of
the
words
she
gasped
twice
as
if
her
breath
had
gone
and
then
with
a
stagger
and
a
shiver
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
afy
hallijohn
recovered
from
her
fainting
fit
had
to
be
smuggled
out
of
miss
carlyle
s
as
she
had
been
smuggled
in
she
was
of
an
elastic
nature
and
the
shock
or
the
surprise
or
the
heat
whatever
it
may
have
been
being
over
afy
was
herself
again
not
very
far
removed
from
the
residence
of
miss
carlyle
was
a
shop
in
the
cheese
and
ham
and
butter
and
bacon
line
a
very
respectable
shop
too
and
kept
by
a
very
respectable
man
a
young
man
of
mild
countenance
who
had
purchased
the
of
the
business
through
an
advertisement
and
come
down
from
london
to
take
possession
his
predecessor
had
amassed
enough
to
retire
and
people
foretold
that
jiffin
would
do
the
same
to
say
that
miss
carlyle
dealt
at
the
shop
will
be
sufficient
to
proclaim
the
good
quality
of
the
articles
kept
in
it
when
afy
arrived
opposite
the
shop
jiffin
was
sunning
himself
at
the
door
his
shopman
inside
being
at
some
urgent
employment
over
the
contents
of
a
afy
stopped
jiffin
admired
her
uncommonly
and
she
always
ready
for
anything
in
that
way
had
already
enjoyed
several
passing
flirtations
with
him
good
day
miss
hallijohn
cried
he
warmly
tucking
up
his
white
apron
and
pushing
it
round
to
the
back
of
his
waist
in
the
best
manner
he
could
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
for
afy
had
once
hinted
in
terms
of
disparagement
at
that
very
apron
oh
how
are
you
jiffin
cried
afy
loftily
pretending
not
to
have
seen
him
standing
there
and
she
condescended
to
put
the
tips
of
her
white
gloves
into
the
offered
hand
as
she
coquetted
with
her
handkerchief
her
veil
and
her
ringlets
i
thought
you
would
have
shut
up
your
shop
jiffin
and
taken
a
business
must
be
attended
to
responded
jiffin
quite
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
afy
s
numerous
attractions
unusually
conspicuous
as
they
were
had
i
known
that
you
were
abroad
miss
hallijohn
and
enjoying
a
holiday
perhaps
i
might
have
done
it
too
in
the
hope
of
coming
across
you
somewhere
or
his
words
were
bona
fide
as
his
admiration
afy
saw
that
so
she
could
afford
to
treat
him
rather
de
haut
en
bas
and
he
s
as
simple
as
a
calf
thought
she
the
greatest
pleasure
i
have
in
life
miss
hallijohn
is
to
see
you
go
by
the
shop
window
continued
jiffin
i
m
sure
it
s
like
as
if
the
sun
itself
dear
me
bridled
afy
with
a
simper
i
don
t
know
any
good
that
can
do
you
you
might
have
seen
me
go
by
an
hour
or
two
ago
if
you
had
possessed
eyes
i
was
on
my
way
to
miss
carlyle
s
she
continued
with
the
air
of
one
who
proclaims
the
fact
of
a
morning
call
upon
a
duchess
where
could
my
eyes
have
been
exclaimed
jiffin
in
an
agony
of
regret
in
some
of
those
precious
i
shouldn
t
wonder
we
have
had
a
bad
lot
in
miss
hallijohn
and
i
am
going
to
return
them
oh
said
afy
conspicuously
resenting
the
remark
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
sort
of
thing
are
beneath
of
course
of
course
miss
hallijohn
deprecated
poor
jiffin
they
are
very
profitable
though
to
those
who
understand
the
what
is
all
that
shouting
cried
afy
alluding
to
a
tremendous
noise
in
the
distance
which
had
continued
for
some
little
time
it
s
the
voters
cheering
carlyle
i
suppose
you
know
that
he
s
elected
miss
hallijohn
no
i
didn
the
other
was
withdrawn
by
his
friends
so
they
made
short
work
of
it
and
carlyle
is
our
member
god
bless
him
there
s
not
many
like
him
but
i
say
miss
hallijohn
whatever
is
it
that
the
other
one
has
done
murder
they
say
i
can
t
make
top
nor
tail
of
it
of
course
we
know
he
was
bad
enough
don
t
ask
me
said
afy
murder
s
not
a
pleasant
subject
for
a
lady
to
discuss
are
all
these
customers
dear
me
you
ll
have
enough
to
do
to
attend
to
them
your
man
can
t
do
it
all
so
i
won
t
stay
talking
any
with
a
gracious
flourish
of
her
flounces
and
wave
of
the
handkerchief
afy
sailed
off
and
jiffin
when
he
could
withdraw
his
fascinated
eyes
from
following
her
turned
into
his
shop
to
assist
in
serving
four
or
five
servant
girls
who
had
entered
it
it
wouldn
t
be
such
a
bad
catch
after
all
soliloquized
afy
as
she
and
her
crinoline
swayed
along
of
course
i
d
never
put
my
nose
inside
the
shop
unless
it
was
to
order
things
like
another
customer
the
worst
is
the
name
jiffin
joe
jiffin
how
could
i
ever
bear
to
be
called
joe
jiffin
not
but
goodness
me
what
do
you
want
the
interruption
to
afy
s
chickens
was
caused
by
ebenezer
james
that
gentleman
who
had
been
walking
with
quick
steps
to
overtake
her
gave
her
flounces
a
twitch
behind
to
let
her
know
somebody
had
come
up
how
are
you
afy
i
was
going
after
you
to
latimer
s
not
knowing
but
you
had
returned
home
i
saw
you
this
morning
at
miss
corny
s
now
i
don
t
want
any
of
your
sauce
ebenezer
james
me
the
other
day
when
you
were
on
with
your
nonsense
i
said
you
should
keep
your
distance
you
took
and
told
jiffin
that
i
was
an
old
sweetheart
of
yours
i
heard
of
so
you
were
laughed
ebenezer
i
never
was
flashed
afy
i
was
the
company
of
your
betters
in
those
days
and
if
there
had
been
no
betters
in
the
case
i
should
have
scorned
you
why
you
have
been
a
strolling
player
and
what
have
you
been
returned
ebenezer
a
quiet
tone
of
meaning
running
through
his
laughter
afy
s
cheeks
flushed
scarlet
and
she
raised
her
hand
with
a
quick
menacing
gesture
but
that
they
were
in
the
public
street
ebenezer
might
have
found
his
ears
boxed
afy
dropped
her
hand
again
and
made
a
dead
standstill
if
you
think
any
vile
false
insinuations
that
you
may
concoct
will
injure
me
you
are
mistaken
ebenezer

laugh

tore
along
what

got
when

put
up
quoth
he
she

afy
and
gained
latimer

that

confined
to
the
house
afy
divesting
herself
of
certain
little
odds
and
ends
of
her
finery
made
her
way
into
latimer
s
presence
oh

such
heartrending
news
as
i
have
had
began
she
a

latimer
after
a
pause
of
dismay
but
how

it
s
a
dying
request
ma
am
pleaded
afy
covering
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief

the
lace

as
if
in
the
depth
of
woe
of
course
i
wouldn
t
ask
you
under
any
other
circumstances
suffering
as
you
are
where

it
to

latimer
how
long
shall

away
afy
mentioned
the
first
town
that
came
uppermost
and
hoped
she
might
be
back
what
relation

continued
latimer
i
thought
you
had
no
relatives
except
joyce
and
your
aunt
this
is
another
aunt
cried
afy
softly
i
have
never
mentioned
her
not
being
friends
differences
divided
us

course
that
makes
me
all
the
more
anxious
to
obey
her
an
uncommon
good
hand
at
an
impromptu
tale
was
afy
and
latimer
consented
to
her
demand
afy
flew
upstairs
attired
herself
once
more
put
one
or
two
things
in
a
small
leather
bag
placed
some
money
in
her
purse
and
left
the
house
sauntering
idly
on
the
pavement
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
was
a
policeman
he
crossed
over
to
afy
with
whom
he
had
a
slight
acquaintance
miss
hallijohn
a
fine
day

it
not
fine
enough

afy
provoked
at
being
hindered
i
can
t
talk
to
you
now
for
i
am
in
a
the
faster
she
walked
the
faster
he
walked
keeping
at
her
side
afy
s
pace
increased
to
a
run
his
increased
to
a
run
too
whatever
are
you
in
such
haste
over
asked
he
well
it

nothing

you

i
am
sure
i
don
t
want
you
to
dance

upon
me
just
now
there

a
time
for
all
things
i
ll

some
chatter
with

hurrying
to

if

have
your
curiosity
satisfied
i
am
going
on
a
little
pleasure
excursion
for
long

home
perhaps
is
it
true
that
carlyle
s
elected
oh
yes
don
t
go
up
that
way
not
up
this
way
repeated
afy
it
s
the
nearest
road
to
the
station
it
cuts
off
all
that
the
officer
laid
his
hand
upon
her
gently
afy
thought
he
was
venturing
upon
it
in
sport
as
if
he
deemed
her
too
charming
to
be
parted
with
what
do
you
mean
by
your
nonsense
i
tell
you
i
have
not
time
for
it
now
take
your
hand
off
me
she
added
grimly
for
the
hand
was
clasping
her
closer
i
am
sorry
to
hurt
a
lady
s
feelings
especially
yours
miss
but
i
daren
t
take
it
off
and
i
daren
t
part
with
you
my
instructions

to
take
you
on
at
once
to

your
evidence
is
wanted
this
if
you
ever
saw
a
ghost
more
livid
than
ghosts
in
ordinary
you
may
picture
to
your
mind
the
appearance
of
afy
hallijohn
just
then
she
did
not
faint
as
she
had
done
once
before
that
day
but
she
looked
as
if
she
should
die
one
sharp
cry
instantly
suppressed
for
afy
did
retain
some
presence
of
mind
and
remembered
that
she
was
in
the
public
road
one
sharp
tussle
for
liberty
over
as
soon
and
she
resigned
herself
perforce
to
her
fate
i
have
no
evidence
to
give
she
said
in
a
calmer
tone
i
know
nothing
of
the
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
anything
of
them
returned
the
man
i
don
t
know
why
you
are
wanted
when
instructions
are
given
us
miss
we
can
t
ask
what
they
mean
i
was
bid
to
watch
that
you
didn
t
go
off
out
of
the
town
and
to
bring
you
on
to
the
if
you
attempted
it
and
i
have
tried
to
do
it
as
politely
as
you
don
t
imagine
i
am
going
to
walk
through
west
lynne
with
your
hand
upon
me
i
ll
take
it
off
miss
hallijohn
if
you
ll
give
a
promise
not
to
bolt
you
see
twould
come
to
nothing
if
you
did
for
i
should
be
up
with
you
in
a
couple
of
yards
besides
it
would
be
drawing
folks
attention
on
you
you
couldn
t
hope
to
outrun
me
or
be
a
match
for
me
in
i
will
go
quietly
said
afy
take
it
she
kept
her
word
afy
was
no
simpleton
and
knew
that
she
was
no
match
for
him
she
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
was
powerless
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
so
they
walked
through
the
street
as
if
they

taking
a
quiet
stroll
he
gallantly
bearing
the
leather
bag
miss
carlyle
s
shocked
eyes
happened
to
fall
upon
them
as
they
passed
her
window
she
wondered
where
could
be
the
eyes
of
the
man
s
inspector
chapter
xl
the
the
magistrates
took
their
seats
on
the
bench
the
bench
would
not
hold
them
all
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
flocked
in
any
other
day
they
would
not
have
been
at
west
lynne
as
to
the
room
the
wonder
was
how
it
ever
got
emptied
again
so
densely
was
it
packed
sir
francis
levison
s
friends
were
there
in
a
body
they
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
accusation
a
scandalous
affair
cried
they
got
up
probably
by
some
sneak
of
the
lord
mount
severn
who
chose
to
be
present
had
a
place
assigned
him
on
the
bench
lord
vane
got
the
best
place
he
could
fight
for
amid
the
crowd
justice
hare
sat
as
chairman
unusually
stern
unbending
and
grim
no
favor
would
he
show
but
no
unfairness
had
it
been
to
save
his
son
from
hanging
he
would
not
adjudge
guilt
to
francis
levison
against
his
conscience
colonel
bethel
was
likewise
on
the
bench
stern
also
in
that
primitive
place
primitive
in
what
related
to
the
and
the
justices
things
were
not
conducted
with
the
regularity
of
the
law
the
law
there
was
often
a
dead
letter
no
very
grave
cases
were
decided
there
they
went
to
lynneborough
a
month
at
the
treadmill
or
a
week
s
imprisonment
or
a
bout
of
juvenile
whipping
were
pretty
near
the
harshest
sentences
pronounced
thus
in
this
examination
as
in
others
evidence
was
advanced
that
was
inadmissible
at
least
that
would
have
been
inadmissible
in
a
more
orthodox
court
hearsay
testimony
and
irregularities
of
that
nature
rubiny
watched
the
case
on
behalf
of
sir
francis
levison
ball
opened
the
proceedings
giving
the
account
which
had
been
imparted
to
him
by
richard
hare
but
not
mentioning
richard
as
his
informant
he
was
questioned
as
to
whence
he
obtained
his
information
but
replied
that
it
was
not
convenient
at
present
to
disclose
the
source
the
stumbling
block
of
the
magistrates
appeared
to
be
the
identifying
levison
with
thorn
ebenezer
james
came
forward
to
prove
it
what
do
you
know
of
the
prisoner
sir
francis
levison
questioned
justice
herbert
not
much
responded
ebenezer
i
used
to
know
him
as
captain
captain
thorn
afy
hallijohn
called
him
captain
but
i
understood
he
was
but
a
from
whom
did
you
understand
that
from
afy
she
was
the
only
person
i
heard
speak
of
and
you
say
you
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
in
the
place
mentioned
the
abbey
wood
i
saw
him
there
repeatedly
also
at
hallijohn
s
did
you
speak
with
him
as
thorn
two
or
three
times
i
addressed
him
as
thorn
and
he
answered
to
the
name
i
had
no
suspicion
but
that
it
was
his
name
otway
bethel
casting
his
eyes
on
otway
who
stood
in
his
shaggy
attire
also
knew
him
as
thorn
and
so
i
have
no
doubt
did
locksley
for
he
was
always
in
the
anybody
else
poor
hallijohn
himself
knew
him
as
thorn
he
said
to
afy
one
day
in
my
presence
that
he
would
not
have
that
confounded
dandy
thorn
coming
were
those
the
words
he
used
they
were
that
confounded
dandy
i
remember
afy
s
reply
it
was
rather
insolent
she
said
thorn
was
as
free
to
come
there
as
anybody
else
and
she
would
not
be
found
fault
with
as
though
she
was
not
fit
to
take
care
of
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
were
any
others
acquainted
with
this
thorn
i
should
imagine
the
elder
sister
joyce
was
and
the
one
who
knew
him
best
of
all
of
us
was
young
richard
old
richard
hare
from
his
place
on
the
bench
frowned
menacingly
at
an
imaginary
richard
what
took
thorn
into
the
wood
so
often
he
was
courting
with
an
intention
of
marrying
her
well
no
cried
ebenezer
with
a
twist
of
the
mouth
i
should
not
suppose
he
entertained
any
intention
of
the
sort
he
used
to
come
over
from
swainson
or
its
neighborhood
riding
a
splendid
whom
did
you
suppose
him
to
be
i
supposed
him
to
be
moving
in
the
upper
ranks
of
life
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
his
dress
his
manners
his
tone
all
proclaimed
it
he
appeared
to
wish
to
shun
observation
and
evidently
did
not
care
to
be
seen
by
any
of
us
he
rarely
arrived
until
did
you
see
him
there
on
the
night
of
hallijohn
s
murder
no
i
was
not
there
myself
that
evening
so
could
not
have
seen
did
a
suspicion
cross
your
mind
at
any
time
that
he
may
have
been
guilty
of
the
murder
never
richard
hare
was
accused
of
it
by
universal
belief
and
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
suppose
he
had
not
done
pray
how
many
years
is
this
ago
sharply
interrupted
rubiny
perceiving
that
the
witness
was
done
with
let
s
see
responded
ebenezer
i
can
t
be
sure
as
to
a
year
without
reckoning
up
a
dozen
if
not
and
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
swear
to
sir
francis
levison
being
that
man
with
all
these
years
intervening
i
swear
that
he
is
the
man
i
am
as
positive
of
his
identity
as
i
am
of
my
without
having
seen
him
from
that
time
to
this
derisively
returned
the
lawyer
nonsense
i
did
not
say
that
returned
ebenezer
the
court
pricked
up
its
ears
have
you
seen
him
between
then
and
now
asked
one
of
them
where
and
when
it
was
in
london
about
eighteen
months
after
the
period
of
the
trial
what
communication
had
you
with
him
none
at
all
i
only
saw
him
quite
by
and
whom
did
you
suppose
him
to
be
then
thorn
or
levison
thorn
certainly
i
never
dreamt
of
his
being
levison
until
he
appeared
here
now
to
oppose
a
wild
savage
curse
shot
through
sir
francis
s
heart
as
he
heard
the
words
what
demon
had
possessed
him
to
venture
his
neck
into
the
lion
s
den
there
had
been
a
strong
hidden
power
holding
him
back
from
it
independent
of
his
dislike
to
face
carlyle
how
could
he
be
so
mad
as
to
disregard
it
how
could
a
man
go
from
his
doom
can
any
you
may
have
been
mistaken
witness
as
to
the
identity
of
the
man
you
saw
in
london
it
may
not
have
been
the
thorn
you
had
known
ebenezer
james
smiled
a
peculiar
smile
i
was
not
mistaken
he
said
his
tone
sounding
remarkably
significant
i
am
upon
my
call
aphrodite
the
lady
appeared
supported
by
her
friend
the
policeman
and
ebenezer
james
was
desired
by
ball
to
leave
the
court
while
she
gave
her
evidence
doubtless
he
had
his
reasons
what
is
your
name
afy
replied
she
looking
daggers
at
everybody
and
sedulously
keeping
her
back
turned
upon
francis
levison
and
otway
bethel
your
name
in
full
if
you
please
you
were
not
christened
afy
aphrodite
hallijohn
you
all
know
my
name
as
well
as
i
do
where
s
the
use
of
asking
useless
questions
swear
the
witness
spoke
up
justice
hare
the
first
word
he
had
uttered
i
won
t
be
sworn
said
afy
you
must
be
sworn
said
justice
herbert
but
i
say
i
won
t
repeated
afy
then
we
must
commit
you
to
prison
for
contempt
of
there
was
no
mercy
in
his
tone
and
afy
turned
white
sir
john
dobede
interposed
young
woman
had
you
a
hand
in
the
murder
of
your
father
i
returned
afy
struggling
with
passion
temper
and
excitement
how
dare
you
ask
me
such
an
unnatural
question
sir
he
was
the
kindest
father
she
added
battling
with
her
tears
i
loved
him
dearly
i
would
have
saved
his
life
with
and
yet
you
refuse
to
give
evidence
that
may
assist
in
bringing
his
destroyer
to
no
i
don
t
refuse
on
that
score
i
should
like
his
destroyer
to
be
hanged
and
i
d
go
to
see
it
but
who
knows
what
other
questions
you
may
be
asking
me
about
things
that
concerned
neither
you
nor
anybody
else
that
s
why
i
we
have
only
to
deal
with
what
bears
upon
the
murder
the
questions
put
to
you
will
relate
to
afy
considered
well
you
may
swear
me
then
she
said
little
notion
had
she
of
the
broad
gauge
those
questions
would
run
upon
and
she
was
sworn
accordingly
very
unwillingly
yet
for
afy
who
would
have
told
lies
by
the
bushel
unsworn
did
look
upon
an
oath
as
a
serious
matter
and
felt
herself
compelled
to
speak
the
truth
when
examined
under
it
how
did
you
become
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
you
often
saw
in
those
days
captain
thorn
there
uttered
the
dismayed
afy
you
are
beginning
already
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
did
not
do
the
you
have
sworn
to
answer
the
questions
put
was
the
uncompromising
rejoinder
how
did
you
become
acquainted
with
captain
thorn
i
met
him
at
swainson
doggedly
answered
afy
i
went
over
there
one
day
just
for
a
spree
and
i
met
him
at
a
pastrycook
and
he
fell
in
love
with
your
pretty
face
said
lawyer
ball
taking
up
the
examination
in
the
incense
to
her
vanity
afy
nearly
forgot
her
scruples
yes
he
did
she
answered
casting
a
smile
of
general
satisfaction
round
upon
the
court
and
got
out
of
you
where
you
lived
and
entered
upon
his
courting
riding
over
nearly
every
evening
to
see
you
well
acknowledged
afy
there
was
no
harm
in
oh
certainly
not
acquiesced
the
lawyer
in
a
pleasant
free
tone
to
put
the
witness
at
her
ease
rather
good
i
should
say
i
wish
i
had
had
the
like
luck
did
you
know
him
at
the
time
by
the
name
of
levison
no
he
said
he
was
captain
thorn
and
i
thought
he
did
you
know
where
he
lived
no
he
never
said
that
i
thought
he
was
stopping
temporarily
at
and
dear
me
what
a
sweet
bonnet
that
is
you
have
on
afy
whose
egregious
vanity
was
her
besetting
sin
who
possessed
enough
of
it
for
any
ten
pretty
women
going
cast
a
glance
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
at
the
admired
bonnet
and
became
ball
s
entirely
and
how
long
was
it
after
your
first
meeting
with
him
before
you
discovered
his
real
name
not
for
a
long
time
several
subsequent
to
the
murder
i
presume
oh
yes
ball
s
eyes
gave
a
twinkle
and
the
unconscious
afy
surreptitiously
smoothed
with
one
finger
the
glossy
parting
of
her
hair
besides
captain
thorn
what
gentlemen
were
in
the
wood
the
night
of
the
murder
richard
hare
was
there
otway
bethel
and
locksley
also
those
were
all
i
saw
until
the
crowd
were
locksley
and
otway
bethel
martyrs
to
your
charms
as
the
other
two
were
no
indeed
was
the
witness
s
answer
with
an
indignant
toss
of
the
head
a
couple
of
poaching
fellows
like
them
they
had
better
have
tried
it
on
which
of
the
two
hare
or
thorn
was
inside
the
cottage
with
you
that
evening
afy
came
out
of
her
vanity
and
hesitated
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
where
the
questions
would
get
to
you
are
upon
your
oath
witness
thundered
justice
hare
if
it
was
my
if
it
was
richard
hare
who
was
with
you
say
so
but
there
must
be
no
equivocation
afy
was
startled
it
was
thorn
she
answered
to
ball
and
where
was
richard
hare
i
don
t
know
he
came
down
but
i
sent
him
away
i
would
not
admit
him
i
dare
say
he
lingered
in
the
did
he
leave
a
gun
with
you
yes
it
was
one
he
had
promised
to
lend
my
father
i
put
it
down
just
inside
the
door
he
told
me
it
was
how
long
after
this
was
it
that
your
father
interrupted
you
he
didn
t
interrupt
us
at
all
returned
afy
i
never
saw
my
father
until
i
saw
him
were
you
not
in
the
cottage
all
the
time
no
we
went
out
for
a
stroll
at
the
back
captain
thorn
wished
me
bye
there
and
i
stayed
did
you
hear
the
gun
go
off
i
heard
a
shot
as
i
was
sitting
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
was
thinking
but
i
attached
no
importance
to
it
never
supposing
it
was
in
the
what
was
it
that
captain
thorn
had
to
get
from
the
cottage
after
he
quitted
you
what
had
he
left
there
now
this
was
a
random
shaft
lawyer
ball
a
keen
man
who
had
well
weighed
all
points
in
the
tale
imparted
to
him
by
richard
as
well
as
other
points
had
colored
them
with
his
own
deductions
and
spoke
accordingly
afy
was
taken
in
he
had
left
his
hat
there
nothing
else
it
was
a
warm
evening
and
he
had
gone
out
without
he
told
you
i
believe
sufficient
to
convince
you
of
the
guilt
of
richard
hare
another
shaft
thrown
at
random
i
did
not
want
convincing
i
knew
it
without
everybody
else
knew
to
be
sure
equably
returned
lawyer
ball
did
captain
thorn
see
it
done
did
he
tell
you
that
he
had
got
his
hat
and
was
away
down
the
wood
some
little
distance
when
he
heard
voices
in
dispute
in
the
cottage
and
recognized
one
of
them
to
be
that
of
my
father
the
shot
followed
close
upon
it
and
he
guessed
some
mischief
had
been
done
though
he
did
not
suspect
its
thorn
told
you
this
when
the
same
night
much
how
came
you
to
see
him
afy
hesitated
but
she
was
sternly
told
to
answer
the
question
a
boy
came
up
to
the
cottage
and
called
me
out
and
said
a
strange
gentleman
wanted
to
see
me
in
the
wood
and
had
given
him
sixpence
to
come
for
me
i
went
and
found
captain
thorn
he
asked
me
what
the
commotion
was
about
and
i
told
him
richard
hare
had
killed
my
father
he
said
that
now
i
spoke
of
him
he
could
recognize
richard
hare
s
as
having
been
the
other
voice
in
the
what
boy
was
that
the
one
who
came
for
you
it
was
mother
whiteman
s
little
and
captain
thorn
then
gave
you
this
version
of
the
tragedy
it
was
the
right
version
resentfully
spoke
afy
how
do
you
know
that
oh
because
i
m
sure
it
was
who
else
would
kill
him
but
richard
hare
it
is
a
scandalous
shame
your
wanting
to
put
it
upon
thorn
look
at
the
prisoner
sir
francis
levison
is
it
he
whom
you
knew
as
thorn
yes
but
that
does
not
make
him
guilty
of
the
of
course
it
does
not
complacently
assented
lawyer
ball
how
long
did
you
remain
with
captain
thorn
in
london
upon
that
little
visit
you
know
afy
started
like
anybody
moonstruck
when
you
quitted
this
place
after
the
tragedy
it
was
to
join
captain
thorn
in
london
how
long
i
ask
did
you
remain
with
him
entirely
a
random
shaft
this
but
richard
had
totally
denied
to
lawyer
ball
the
popular
assumption
that
afy
had
been
with
him
who
says
i
was
with
him
who
says
i
went
after
him
flashed
afy
with
scarlet
cheeks
i
do
replied
lawyer
ball
taking
notes
of
her
confusion
come
it
s
over
and
done
with
it
s
of
no
use
to
deny
it
now
we
all
go
upon
visits
to
friends
i
never
heard
anything
so
bold
cried
afy
where
will
you
tell
me
i
went
next
you
are
upon
your
oath
woman
again
interposed
justice
hare
and
a
trembling
as
of
agitation
might
be
detected
in
his
voice
in
spite
of
its
ringing
severity
were
you
with
the
prisoner
levison
or
were
you
with
richard
hare
i
with
richard
hare
cried
afy
agitated
in
her
turn
and
shaking
like
an
partly
with
discomfiture
partly
with
unknown
dread
how
dare
that
cruel
falsehood
be
brought
up
again
to
my
face
i
never
saw
richard
hare
after
the
night
of
the
murder
i
swear
it
i
swear
that
i
never
saw
him
since
visit
him
i
d
sooner
visit
calcraft
the
there
was
truth
in
the
words
in
the
tone
the
chairman
let
fall
the
hand
which
had
been
raised
to
his
face
holding
on
his
and
a
sort
of
fear
arose
confusing
his
brain
his
son
proved
innocent
of
one
part
might
be
proved
innocent
of
the
other
and
then
how
would
his
own
harsh
conduct
show
out
west
lynne
in
its
charity
the
justice
in
his
had
cast
more
odium
to
richard
with
regard
to
his
after
conduct
touching
this
girl
than
it
had
on
the
score
of
the
murder
come
said
lawyer
ball
in
a
coaxing
tone
let
us
be
pleasant
of
course
you
were
not
with
richard
hare
west
lynne
is
always
were
on
a
visit
to
captain
thorn
as
as
any
other
young
lady
might
be
afy
hung
her
head
cowed
down
to
abject
meekness
answer
the
question
came
forth
the
chairman
s
voice
again
were
you
with
thorn
yes
though
the
answer
was
feeble
enough
ball
coughed
an
insinuating
cough
did
you
remain
with
him
say
two
or
three
years
not
a
little
over
two
perhaps
there
was
no
harm
in
it
shrieked
afy
with
a
catching
sob
of
temper
if
i
chose
to
live
in
london
and
he
chose
to
make
a
morning
call
upon
me
now
and
then
as
an
old
friend
what
s
that
to
anybody
where
was
the
harm
i
ask
certainly
where
was
the
harm
i
am
not
insinuating
any
returned
lawyer
ball
with
a
wink
of
the
eye
furthest
from
the
witness
and
the
bench
and
during
the
time
that
that
he
was
making
these
little
morning
calls
upon
you
did
you
know
him
to
be
levison
yes
i
knew
him
to
be
captain
levison
did
he
ever
tell
you
why
he
had
assumed
the
name
of
thorn
only
for
a
whim
he
said
the
day
he
spoke
to
me
in
the
pastrycook
s
shop
at
swainson
something
came
over
him
in
the
spur
of
the
moment
not
to
give
his
right
name
so
he
gave
the
first
that
came
into
his
head
he
never
thought
to
retain
it
or
that
other
people
would
hear
of
him
by
i
dare
say
not
laconically
spoke
lawyer
ball
well
miss
afy
i
believe
that
is
all
for
the
present
i
want
ebenezer
james
in
again
he
whispered
to
an
officer
of
the
as
the
witness
retired
ebenezer
james
reappeared
and
took
afy
s
place
you
informed
their
worships
just
now
that
you
had
met
thorn
in
london
some
eighteen
months
subsequent
to
the
murder
began
lawyer
ball
launching
another
of
his
shafts
this
must
have
been
during
the
period
of
afy
hallijohn
s
sojourn
with
him
did
you
also
see
her
ebenezer
opened
his
eyes
he
knew
nothing
of
the
evidence
just
given
by
afy
and
wondered
how
on
earth
it
had
come
out
that
she
had
been
with
thorn
at
all
he
had
never
betrayed
it
afy
stammered
he
yes
afy
sharply
returned
the
lawyer
their
worships
know
that
when
she
took
that
trip
of
hers
from
west
lynne
it
was
to
join
thorn
not
richard
hare
though
the
latter
has
borne
the
credit
of
it
i
ask
you
did
you
see
her
for
she
was
then
still
connected
with
well
yes
i
did
replied
ebenezer
his
own
scruples
removed
but
wondering
still
how
it
had
been
discovered
unless
afy
had
as
he
had
prophesied
she
would
let
out
in
her
in
fact
it
was
afy
whom
i
first
state
the
i
was
up
paddington
way
one
afternoon
and
saw
a
lady
going
into
a
house
it
was
afy
hallijohn
she
lived
there
i
found
had
the
room
apartments
she
invited
me
to
stay
to
tea
with
her
and
i
did
you
see
captain
levison
there
i
saw
thorn
as
i
thought
him
to
be
afy
told
me
i
must
be
away
by
eight
o
clock
for
she
was
expecting
a
friend
who
sometimes
came
to
sit
with
her
for
an
hour
s
chat
but
in
talking
over
old
times
not
that
i
could
tell
her
much
about
west
lynne
for
i
had
left
it
almost
as
long
as
she
had
the
time
slipped
on
past
the
hour
when
afy
found
that
out
she
hurried
me
off
and
i
had
barely
got
outside
the
gate
when
a
cab
drove
up
and
thorn
alighted
from
it
and
let
himself
in
with
a
key
that
is
all
i
when
you
knew
that
the
scandal
of
afy
s
absence
rested
on
richard
hare
why
could
you
not
have
said
this
and
cleared
him
on
your
return
to
west
lynne
it
was
no
affair
of
mine
that
i
should
make
it
public
afy
asked
me
not
to
say
i
had
seen
her
and
i
promised
her
i
would
not
as
to
richard
hare
a
little
extra
scandal
on
his
back
was
nothing
while
there
remained
on
it
the
worse
scandal
of
stop
a
bit
interposed
rubiny
as
the
witness
was
about
to
retire
you
speak
of
the
time
being
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
sir
was
it
dark
then
how
can
you
be
certain
it
was
thorn
who
got
out
of
the
cab
and
entered
i
am
quite
certain
there
was
a
right
at
the
spot
and
i
saw
him
as
well
as
i
should
have
seen
him
in
daylight
i
knew
his
voice
too
could
have
sworn
to
it
anywhere
and
i
would
almost
have
sworn
to
him
by
his
splendid
diamond
ring
it
flashed
in
the
his
voice
did
he
speak
to
you
no
but
he
spoke
to
the
cabman
there
was
a
half
dispute
between
them
the
man
said
thorn
had
not
paid
him
enough
that
he
had
not
allowed
for
having
been
kept
waiting
twenty
minutes
on
the
road
thorn
swore
at
him
a
bit
and
then
flung
him
an
extra
the
next
witness
was
a
man
who
had
been
groom
to
the
late
sir
peter
levison
he
testified
that
the
prisoner
francis
levison
had
been
on
a
visit
to
his
master
late
in
the
summer
and
part
of
the
autumn
the
year
that
hallijohn
was
killed
that
he
frequently
rode
out
in
the
direction
of
west
lynne
especially
toward
evening
would
be
away
three
or
four
hours
and
come
home
with
the
horse
in
a
foam
also
that
he
picked
up
two
letters
at
different
times
which
levison
had
carelessly
let
fall
from
his
pocket
and
returned
them
to
him
both
the
notes
were
addressed
captain
but
they
had
not
been
through
the
post
for
there
was
no
further
superscription
on
them
and
the
writing
looked
like
a
lady
s
he
remembered
quite
well
hearing
of
the
murder
of
hallijohn
the
witness
added
in
answer
to
a
question
it
made
a
great
stir
through
out
the
country
it
was
just
at
that
same
time
that
levison
concluded
his
visit
and
returned
to
london
a
wonderful
memory
rubiny
sarcastically
remarked
the
witness
a
quiet
respectable
man
replied
that
he
had
a
good
memory
but
that
circumstances
had
impressed
upon
it
particularly
the
fact
that
levison
s
departure
followed
close
upon
the
murder
of
hallijohn
one
day
when
sir
peter
was
round
at
the
stables
gentlemen
he
was
urging
his
nephew
to
prolong
his
visit
and
asked
what
sudden
freak
was
taking
him
off
levison
replied
that
unexpected
business
called
him
to
london
while
they
were
talking
the
coachman
came
up
all
in
a
heat
telling
that
hallijohn
of
west
lynne
had
been
murdered
by
young
hare
i
remember
sir
peter
said
he
could
not
believe
it
and
that
it
must
have
been
an
accident
not
is
that
all
there
was
more
said
levison
in
a
shameful
sort
of
manner
asked
his
uncle
would
he
let
him
have
five
or
ten
pounds
sir
peter
seemed
angry
and
asked
what
had
he
done
with
the
note
he
had
made
him
a
present
of
only
the
previous
morning
levison
replied
that
he
had
sent
that
away
to
a
brother
officer
to
whom
he
was
in
debt
sir
peter
refused
to
believe
it
and
said
he
had
more
likely
squandered
it
upon
some
disgraceful
folly
levison
denied
that
he
had
but
he
looked
confused
indeed
his
manner
altogether
was
confused
that
did
he
get
the
five
or
ten
pounds
i
don
t
know
gentlemen
i
dare
say
he
did
for
my
master
was
as
persuadable
as
a
woman
though
he
d
fly
out
a
bit
sometimes
at
first
levison
departed
for
london
that
same
the
last
witness
called
was
dill
on
the
previous
tuesday
evening
he
had
been
returning
home
from
spending
an
hour
at
beauchamp
s
when
in
a
field
opposite
to
justice
hare
s
he
suddenly
heard
a
commotion
it
arose
from
the
meeting
of
sir
francis
levison
and
otway
bethel
the
former
appeared
to
have
been
enjoying
a
solitary
moonlight
ramble
and
the
latter
to
have
encountered
him
unexpectedly
words
ensued
bethel
accused
sir
francis
of
shirking
him
sir
francis
answered
angrily
that
he
knew
nothing
of
him
and
nothing
he
wanted
to
know
you
were
glad
enough
to
know
something
of
me
the
night
of
hallijohn
s
murder
retorted
bethel
to
this
do
you
remember
that
i
could
hang
you
one
little
word
from
me
and
you
d
stand
in
dick
hare
s
you
fool
passionately
cried
sir
francis
you
couldn
t
hang
me
without
putting
your
own
head
in
a
noose
did
you
not
have
your
hush
money
are
you
wanting
to
do
me
out
of
more
a
cursed
paltry
note
of
fifty
pounds
foamed
otway
bethel
which
many
a
time
since
i
have
wished
my
fingers
were
blown
off
before
they
touched
i
never
should
have
touched
it
but
that
i
was
altogether
overwhelmed
with
the
moment
s
confusion
i
have
not
been
able
to
look
hare
in
the
face
since
knowing
that
i
held
the
secret
that
would
save
her
son
from
the
and
put
yourself
in
his
place
sneered
sir
francis
no
put
that
s
as
it
might
be
but
if
i
went
to
the
hangman
you
would
go
with
me
there
would
be
no
excuse
or
escape
for
you
you
know
the
warfare
continued
longer
but
this
was
the
cream
of
it
dill
heard
the
whole
and
repeated
it
now
to
the
magistrate
rubiny
protested
that
it
was
inadmissible
hearsay
evidence
contrary
to
law
but
the
bench
oracularly
put
rubiny
down
and
told
him
they
did
not
want
any
stranger
to
come
there
and
teach
them
their
business
colonel
bethel
had
leaned
forward
at
the
conclusion
of
dill
s
evidence
dismay
on
his
face
agitation
in
his
voice
are
you
sure
that
you
made
no
mistake
that
the
other
in
this
interview
was
otway
bethel
dill
sadly
shook
his
head
am
i
one
to
swear
to
a
wrong
man
colonel
i
wish
i
had
not
heard
it
save
that
it
may
be
the
means
of
clearing
richard
sir
francis
levison
had
braved
out
the
proceedings
with
a
haughty
cavalier
air
his
delicate
hands
and
his
diamond
ring
remarkably
conspicuous
was
that
stone
the
real
thing
or
a
false
one
substituted
for
the
real
hard
up
as
he
had
long
been
for
money
the
suspicion
might
arise
a
derisive
smile
crossed
his
features
at
parts
of
the
evidence
as
much
as
to
say
you
may
convict
me
as
to
mademoiselle
afy
but
you
can
t
as
to
the
when
however
dill
s
testimony
was
given
what
a
change
was
there
his
mood
tamed
down
to
what
looked
like
abject
fear
and
he
shook
in
his
shoes
as
he
stood
of
course
your
worships
will
take
bail
for
sir
francis
said
rubiny
at
the
close
of
the
proceedings
bail
the
bench
looked
at
one
another
your
worships
will
not
refuse
it
a
gentleman
in
sir
francis
levison
s
position
the
bench
thought
they
never
had
so
insolent
an
application
made
to
them
bail
for
him
on
this
charge
no
not
if
the
lord
chancellor
himself
came
down
to
offer
it
otway
bethel
conscious
probably
that
nobody
would
offer
bail
for
him
not
even
the
colonel
did
not
ask
the
bench
to
take
it
so
the
two
were
fully
committed
to
take
their
trial
for
the
wilful
murder
otherwise
the
killing
and
slaying
of
george
hallijohn
and
before
night
would
be
on
their
road
to
the
county
prison
at
lynneborough
and
that
vain
afy
what
of
her
well
afy
had
retreated
to
the
again
after
giving
evidence
and
there
she
remained
to
the
close
agreeably
occupied
in
a
mental
debate
what
would
they
make
out
from
her
admission
regarding
her
sojourn
in
london
and
the
morning
calls
how
would
that
precious
west
lynne
construe
it
she
did
not
much
care
she
would
brave
it
out
and
assail
them
with
towering
indignation
did
any
dare
to
cast
a
stone
at
her
such
was
her
final
decision
arrived
at
just
as
the
proceedings
terminated
afy
was
right
glad
to
remain
where
she
was
till
some
of
the
bustle
had
gone
how
was
it
ended
asked
she
of
ball
who
being
a
bachelor
was
ever
regarded
with
much
graciousness
by
afy
for
she
kept
her
eyes
open
to
contingencies
although
joe
jiffin
was
held
in
reserve
they
are
both
committed
for
wilful
murder
off
to
lynneborough
within
an
hour
afy
s
color
rose
what
a
shame
to
commit
two
innocent
men
upon
such
a
i
can
tell
you
what
miss
afy
the
sooner
you
disabuse
your
mind
of
that
prejudice
the
better
levison
has
been
as
good
as
proved
guilty
but
if
proof
were
wanting
he
and
bethel
have
criminated
each
other
when
rogues
fall
out
honest
men
get
their
not
that
i
can
quite
fathom
bethel
s
share
in
the
exploit
though
i
can
pretty
well
guess
at
it
and
in
proving
themselves
guilty
they
have
proved
the
innocence
of
richard
afy
s
face
was
changing
to
whiteness
her
confident
air
to
one
of
dread
her
vanity
to
humiliation
it
can
t
be
true
she
gasped
it
s
true
enough
the
part
you
have
hitherto
ascribed
to
thorn
was
enacted
by
richard
hare
he
heard
the
shot
from
his
place
in
the
wood
and
saw
thorn
run
ghastly
trembling
horrified
from
his
wicked
work
believe
me
it
was
thorn
who
killed
your
afy
grew
cold
as
she
listened
that
one
awful
moment
when
conviction
that
his
words
were
true
forced
itself
upon
her
was
enough
to
sober
her
for
a
whole
lifetime
thorn
her
sight
failed
her
head
reeled
her
very
heart
turned
to
sickness
one
struggling
cry
of
pain
and
for
the
second
time
that
day
afy
hallijohn
fell
forward
in
a
fainting
fit
shouts
hisses
execrations
yells
the
prisoners
were
being
brought
forth
to
be
conveyed
to
lynneborough
a
whole
posse
of
constables
was
necessary
to
protect
them
against
the
outbreak
of
the
mob
which
outbreak
was
not
directed
against
otway
bethel
but
against
sir
francis
levison
cowering
like
the
guilty
culprit
that
he
was
shivered
he
hiding
his
white
face
wondering
whether
it
would
be
a
repetition
of
justice
hare
s
green
pond
or
tearing
him
asunder
piecemeal
and
cursing
the
earth
because
it
did
not
open
and
let
him
in
chapter
xli
firm
miss
lucy
was
en
penitence
she
had
been
guilty
of
some
childish
fault
that
day
at
aunt
cornelia
s
which
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
carlyle
after
their
return
home
the
young
lady
was
ordered
to
the
nursery
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
to
be
regaled
upon
bread
and
water
barbara
was
in
her
pleasant
there
was
to
be
a
dinner
party
at
east
lynne
that
evening
and
she
had
just
finished
dressing
very
lovely
looked
she
in
her
dinner
dress
with
purple
and
scarlet
flowers
in
her
bosom
she
glanced
at
her
watch
somewhat
anxiously
for
the
gentlemen
had
not
made
their
appearance
six
and
they
were
to
dine
at
seven
madame
vine
tapped
at
the
door
her
errand
was
to
beg
grace
for
lucy
she
had
been
promised
half
an
hour
in
the
when
the
ladies
entered
it
from
the
and
was
now
in
agony
of
grief
at
the
disappointment
would
carlyle
pardon
her
and
allow
her
to
be
dressed
you
are
too
lenient
to
the
child
madame
spoke
barbara
i
don
t
think
you
ever
would
punish
her
at
all
but
when
she
commits
faults
they
must
be
she
is
very
sorry
for
her
fault
she
promises
not
to
be
rude
again
she
is
crying
as
if
she
would
cry
her
heart
not
for
her
but
because
she
s
afraid
of
missing
the
cried
barbara
do
pray
restore
her
to
favor
pleaded
madame
i
shall
see
just
look
madame
vine
i
broke
this
a
minute
or
two
ago
is
it
not
a
pity
barbara
held
in
her
hand
a
beautiful
toilette
ornament
set
in
pure
gold
one
of
the
petals
had
come
off
madame
vine
examined
it
i
have
some
cement
upstairs
that
would
join
it
she
exclaimed
i
could
do
it
in
two
minutes
i
bought
it
in
oh
i
wish
you
would
was
barbara
s
delighted
response
do
bring
it
here
and
join
it
now
shall
i
bribe
you
she
added
laughing
you
make
this
all
right
and
then
you
shall
bear
back
grace
to
lucy
for
i
perceive
that
is
what
your
heart
is
set
madame
vine
went
and
returned
with
her
cement
barbara
watched
her
as
she
took
the
pieces
in
her
hand
to
see
how
the
one
must
fit
on
to
the
other
this
has
been
broken
once
as
joyce
tells
me
barbara
said
but
it
must
have
been
imperceptibly
joined
for
i
have
looked
in
vain
for
the
damage
carlyle
bought
it
for
his
first
wife
when
they
were
in
london
after
their
marriage
she
broke
it
subsequently
here
at
east
lynne
you
will
never
do
it
madame
vine
if
your
hand
shakes
like
that
what
is
the
matter
a
great
deal
was
the
matter
first
the
ominous
words
had
been
upon
her
tongue
it
was
here
where
the
stem
joins
the
flower
but
she
recollected
herself
in
time
next
came
up
the
past
vision
of
the
place
and
hour
when
the
accident
occurred
her
hanging
sleeve
had
swept
it
off
the
table
carlyle
was
in
the
room
and
he
had
soothed
her
sorrow
her
almost
childish
sorrow
with
kisses
sweet
ah
me
poor
thing
i
think
our
hands
would
have
shaken
as
hers
did
the
ornament
and
the
kisses
were
barbara
s
now
i
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
and
back
again
was
the
explanation
she
offered
to
carlyle
for
her
shaking
hands
at
that
moment
carlyle
and
their
guests
were
heard
to
return
and
ascend
to
their
respective
apartments
lord
vane
s
gleeful
voice
echoing
through
the
house
carlyle
came
into
his
wife
s
and
madame
vine
would
have
made
a
precipitate
retreat
no
no
said
barbara
finish
it
now
you
have
begun
carlyle
will
be
going
to
his
room
look
at
the
misfortune
i
have
had
archibald
i
have
broken
carlyle
glanced
carelessly
at
the
trinket
and
at
madame
vine
s
white
fingers
he
crossed
to
the
door
of
his
and
opened
it
then
held
out
his
hand
in
silence
for
barbara
to
approach
and
drew
her
in
with
him
madame
vine
went
on
with
her
work
presently
barbara
returned
and
approached
the
table
where
stood
madame
vine
while
she
drew
on
her
gloves
her
eyelashes
were
wet
i
could
not
help
shedding
a
few
tears
of
joy
exclaimed
barbara
with
a
pretty
blush
perceiving
that
madame
observed
the
signs
mr
carlyle
has
been
telling
me
that
my
brother
s
innocence
is
now
all
but
patent
to
the
world
it
came
out
upon
the
examination
of
those
two
men
sir
francis
and
otway
bethel
lord
mount
severn
was
present
at
the
proceedings
and
says
they
have
in
some
way
incriminated
each
other
papa
sat
in
his
place
as
chairman
i
wonder
that
he
liked
to
do
lower
bent
the
head
of
madame
vine
over
her
employment
has
anything
been
proved
against
them
she
asked
in
her
usual
soft
tone
almost
a
whisper
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
of
the
guilt
of
levison
but
otway
bethel
s
share
in
the
affair
is
a
puzzle
yet
replied
carlyle
both
are
committed
for
trial
oh
that
man
that
man
how
his
sins
come
out
she
continued
in
excitement
madame
vine
glanced
up
through
her
spectacles
would
you
believe
continued
barbara
dropping
her
voice
that
while
west
lynne
and
i
fear
ourselves
also
gave
that
miserable
afy
credit
for
having
gone
away
with
richard
she
was
all
the
time
with
levison
ball
the
lawyer
got
her
to
confess
i
am
unacquainted
with
the
details
carlyle
would
not
give
them
to
me
he
said
the
bare
fact
was
quite
enough
and
considering
the
associations
it
involved
would
not
do
to
talk
carlyle
was
right
out
it
seems
to
come
little
by
little
one
wickedness
after
another
resumed
barbara
i
do
not
like
carlyle
to
hear
it
no
i
don
t
of
course
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
he
must
feel
it
terribly
as
must
also
lord
mount
severn
she
was
his
wife
you
know
and
the
children
are
hers
and
to
think
that
she
i
mean
he
must
feel
it
for
her
went
on
barbara
after
her
sudden
pause
and
there
was
some
hauteur
in
her
tone
lest
she
should
be
misunderstood
mr
carlyle
is
one
of
the
very
few
men
so
entirely
noble
whom
the
sort
of
disgrace
reflected
from
lady
isabel
s
conduct
can
not
the
carriage
of
the
first
guest
barbara
ran
across
the
room
and
rattled
at
carlyle
s
door
archibald
do
you
hear
back
came
the
laughing
answer
i
shan
t
keep
them
long
but
they
may
surely
accord
a
few
minutes
grace
to
a
man
who
has
just
been
converted
into
an
barbara
descended
to
the
leaving
her
that
unhappy
lady
to
the
cement
and
the
broken
pieces
and
to
battle
as
best
she
could
with
her
bitter
heart
nothing
but
stabs
nothing
but
stabs
was
her
punishment
ever
to
end
no
the
step
she
had
taken
in
coming
back
to
east
lynne
had
precluded
that
the
guests
arrived
all
save
and
hare
barbara
received
a
note
from
her
instead
the
justice
did
not
feel
well
enough
to
join
them
i
should
think
he
did
not
a
pleasant
party
it
was
at
east
lynne
and
twelve
o
clock
struck
before
the
carriage
of
the
last
guest
drove
away
it
may
have
been
from
one
to
two
hours
after
that
and
the
house
was
steeped
in
moonlight
and
quietness
everybody
being
abed
and
asleep
when
a
loud
summons
at
the
hall
bell
echoed
through
the
stillness
the
first
to
put
her
head
out
the
window
was
wilson
is
it
fire
shrieked
she
in
the
most
excessive
state
of
terror
conceivable
wilson
had
a
natural
dread
of
fire
some
people
do
possess
this
dread
more
than
others
and
had
oftentime
aroused
the
house
to
a
commotion
by
declaring
she
smelt
it
is
it
fire
shrieked
wilson
yes
was
shouted
at
the
top
of
a
man
s
voice
who
stepped
from
between
the
entrance
pillars
to
answer
wilson
waited
for
no
more
clutching
at
the
baby
with
one
hand
a
fine
young
gentleman
now
of
near
twelve
months
old
promising
fair
to
be
as
great
a
source
of
trouble
to
wilson
and
the
nursery
as
was
his
brother
archibald
whom
he
greatly
resembled
and
at
archie
with
the
other
out
she
flew
to
the
corridor
screeching
fire
fire
fire
never
ceasing
down
tore
wilson
with
the
four
children
and
burst
unceremoniously
into
the
sleeping
apartment
of
and
carlyle
by
this
time
the
children
terrified
out
of
their
senses
not
at
wilson
s
cry
of
alarm
but
at
the
summary
propelling
downstairs
set
up
a
shrieking
too
madame
vine
believing
that
half
the
house
as
least
was
in
flames
was
the
next
to
appear
throwing
on
a
shawl
she
had
caught
up
and
then
came
joyce
fire
fire
fire
shouted
wilson
we
are
all
being
burnt
up
together
poor
carlyle
thus
wildly
aroused
from
sleep
sprang
out
of
bed
and
into
the
corridor
in
her
everybody
else
was
in
a
dress
when
folks
are
flying
for
dear
life
they
don
t
stop
to
look
for
their
and
best
blonde
caps
out
came
carlyle
who
had
hastily
assumed
his
pantaloons
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
down
to
the
hall
and
saw
that
the
stairs
were
perfectly
free
for
escape
therefore
to
hurry
was
not
so
violent
every
soul
around
him
was
shrieking
in
concert
making
the
confusion
and
din
terrific
the
bright
moonlight
streamed
in
at
the
corridor
windows
but
there
was
no
other
light
shadowy
and
indistinct
enough
looked
the
white
figures
where
is
the
fire
he
exclaimed
i
don
t
smell
any
who
gave
the
first
alarm
the
bell
answered
him
the
which
rang
out
ten
times
louder
and
longer
than
before
he
opened
one
of
the
windows
and
leaned
from
it
who
s
there
madame
vine
caught
up
archie
it
s
me
sir
responded
a
voice
which
he
at
once
recognized
to
be
that
of
one
of
hare
s
master
has
been
took
in
a
fit
sir
and
mistress
sent
me
for
you
and
miss
barbara
you
must
please
make
haste
sir
if
you
want
to
see
him
miss
barbara
it
was
more
familiar
to
jasper
in
a
moment
of
excitement
than
the
new
name
you
jasper
is
the
house
on
fire
this
house
well
i
don
t
know
sir
i
can
hear
a
dreadful
deal
of
screeching
in
carlyle
closed
the
window
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
danger
lay
in
fear
alone
who
told
you
there
was
fire
he
demanded
of
wilson
that
man
ringing
at
the
door
sobbed
wilson
thank
goodness
i
have
saved
the
children
carlyle
felt
somewhat
exasperated
at
the
mistake
his
wife
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
her
face
of
a
deadly
whiteness
and
he
knew
that
she
was
not
in
a
condition
to
be
alarmed
necessarily
or
unnecessarily
she
clung
to
him
in
terror
asking
if
they
could
escape
my
darling
be
calm
there
s
no
fire
it
s
a
stupid
mistake
you
may
all
go
back
to
bed
and
sleep
in
peace
he
added
to
the
rest
and
the
next
time
that
you
alarm
the
house
in
the
night
wilson
have
the
goodness
to
make
yourself
sure
first
of
all
that
there
s
cause
for
barbara
frightened
still
bewildered
and
uncertain
escaped
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
but
carlyle
was
nearly
as
quick
as
she
he
caught
her
to
him
with
one
hand
and
drew
the
window
down
with
the
other
to
have
these
tidings
told
to
her
abruptly
would
be
worse
than
all
by
this
time
some
of
the
servants
had
descended
the
other
staircase
with
a
light
being
in
various
stages
of
costume
and
hastened
to
open
the
jasper
entered
the
man
had
probably
waited
to
help
to
put
out
the
barbara
caught
sight
of
him
ere
carlyle
could
prevent
it
and
grew
sick
with
fear
believing
some
ill
had
happened
to
her
mother
drawing
her
inside
their
chamber
he
broke
the
news
to
her
soothingly
and
tenderly
making
light
of
it
she
burst
into
tears
you
are
not
deceiving
me
archibald
papa
is
not
dead
dead
cheerfully
echoed
carlyle
in
the
same
tone
he
might
have
used
had
barbara
wondered
whether
the
justice
was
taking
a
night
airing
for
pleasure
in
a
balloon
wilson
has
indeed
frightened
you
love
dress
yourself
and
we
will
go
and
see
at
that
moment
barbara
recollected
william
strange
that
she
should
have
been
the
first
to
do
so
before
lady
isabel
before
carlyle
she
ran
out
again
to
the
corridors
where
the
boy
stood
shivering
he
may
have
caught
his
death
she
uttered
snatching
him
up
in
her
arms
oh
wilson
what
have
you
done
his
is
damp
and
unfit
as
she
was
for
the
burden
she
bore
him
to
her
own
bed
wilson
was
not
at
leisure
to
attend
to
reproaches
just
then
she
was
engaged
in
a
wordy
war
with
jasper
leaning
over
the
balustrades
to
carry
it
on
i
never
told
you
there
was
a
fire
indignantly
denied
jasper
you
did
i
opened
the
nursery
window
and
called
out
is
it
fire
and
you
answered
you
called
out
is
it
jasper
what
else
should
i
say
but
yes
to
that
fire
where
was
the
fire
likely
to
be
in
the
park
wilson
take
the
children
back
to
bed
authoritatively
spoke
carlyle
as
he
advanced
to
look
down
into
the
hall
john
are
you
there
the
close
carriage
instantly
look
sharp
madame
vine
pray
don
t
continue
to
hold
that
heavy
boy
joyce
can
t
you
relieve
madame
in
crossing
back
to
his
room
carlyle
had
brushed
past
madame
and
noticed
that
she
appeared
to
be
shaking
as
with
the
weight
of
archibald
in
reality
she
was
still
alarmed
not
understanding
yet
the
cause
of
the
commotion
joyce
who
comprehended
it
as
little
and
had
stood
with
her
arms
round
lucy
advanced
to
take
archibald
and
carlyle
disappeared
barbara
had
taken
off
her
own
warm
then
and
put
it
upon
william
in
place
of
his
cold
one
had
struck
a
light
and
was
busily
dressing
herself
just
feel
his
archibald
wilson
a
shrill
cry
of
awful
terror
interrupted
the
words
and
carlyle
made
one
bound
out
again
barbara
followed
the
least
she
thought
was
that
wilson
had
dropped
the
baby
in
the
hall
that
was
not
the
catastrophe
wilson
with
the
baby
and
lucy
had
already
disappeared
up
the
staircase
and
madame
vine
was
disappearing
archibald
lay
on
the
soft
carpet
of
the
corridor
where
madame
had
stood
for
joyce
in
the
act
of
taking
him
had
let
him
slip
to
the
ground
let
him
fall
from
sheer
terror
she
held
on
to
the
balustrades
her
face
ghastly
her
mouth
open
her
eyes
fixed
in
horror
altogether
an
object
to
look
upon
archie
gathered
himself
on
his
sturdy
legs
and
stood
staring
why
joyce
what
is
the
matter
with
you
cried
carlyle
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
a
oh
master
she
wailed
i
have
seen
are
you
all
going
deranged
together
retorted
he
wondering
what
had
come
to
the
house
seen
a
spectre
joyce
joyce
fell
on
her
knees
as
if
unable
to
support
herself
and
crossed
her
shaking
hands
upon
her
chest
had
she
seen
ten
spectres
she
could
not
have
betrayed
more
dire
distress
she
was
a
sensible
and
faithful
servant
one
not
given
to
flights
of
fancy
and
carlyle
gazed
at
her
in
very
amazement
joyce
what
is
this
he
asked
bending
down
and
speaking
kindly
oh
my
dear
master
heaven
have
mercy
upon
us
all
was
the
inexplicable
answer
joyce
i
ask
you
what
is
this
she
made
no
reply
she
rose
up
shaking
and
taking
archie
s
hand
slowly
proceeded
toward
the
upper
stairs
low
moans
breaking
from
her
and
the
boy
s
naked
feet
pattering
on
the
carpet
what
can
ail
her
whispered
barbara
following
joyce
with
her
eyes
what
did
she
mean
about
a
spectre
she
must
have
been
reading
a
said
carlyle
wilson
s
folly
has
turned
the
house
make
your
haste
spring
waned
summer
came
and
would
soon
be
waning
too
for
the
hot
days
of
july
were
now
in
what
had
the
months
brought
forth
since
the
election
of
carlyle
in
april
be
you
very
sure
they
had
not
been
without
their
events
justice
hare
s
illness
had
turned
out
to
be
a
stroke
of
paralysis
people
can
not
act
with
unnatural
harshness
toward
a
child
and
then
discover
they
have
been
in
the
wrong
with
impunity
thus
it
proved
with
justice
hare
he
was
recovering
but
would
never
again
be
the
man
he
had
been
the
fright
when
jasper
had
gone
to
tell
of
his
illness
at
east
lynne
and
was
mistaken
for
fire
had
done
nobody
any
damage
save
william
and
joyce
william
had
caught
a
cold
which
brought
increased
malady
to
the
lungs
and
joyce
seemed
to
have
caught
fear
she
went
about
more
like
one
in
a
dream
than
awake
would
be
buried
in
a
reverie
for
an
hour
at
a
time
and
if
suddenly
spoken
to
would
start
and
shiver
carlyle
and
his
wife
departed
for
london
immediately
that
hare
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
which
was
in
about
a
week
from
the
time
of
his
seizure
william
accompanied
them
partly
for
the
benefit
of
london
advice
partly
that
carlyle
would
not
be
parted
from
him
joyce
went
in
attendance
with
some
of
the
servants
they
found
london
ringing
with
the
news
of
sir
francis
levison
s
arrest
london
could
not
understand
it
and
the
most
wild
and
improbable
tales
were
in
circulation
the
season
was
at
its
height
the
excitement
in
proportion
it
was
more
than
a
nine
days
wonder
on
the
very
evening
of
their
arrival
a
lady
young
and
beautiful
was
shown
in
to
the
presence
of
and
carlyle
she
had
declined
to
give
her
name
but
there
arose
to
carlyle
s
memory
when
he
looked
upon
her
one
whom
he
had
seen
in
earlier
days
as
the
friend
of
his
first
wife
blanche
challoner
it
was
not
blanche
however
the
stranger
looked
keenly
at
carlyle
he
was
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
on
the
point
of
going
out
will
you
pardon
this
intrusion
she
asked
i
have
come
to
you
as
one
human
being
in
need
comes
to
crave
help
of
another
i
am
lady
barbara
s
face
flushed
carlyle
courteously
invited
the
stranger
to
a
chair
remaining
standing
himself
she
sat
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
evidently
in
an
excess
of
agitation
yes
i
am
lady
levison
forced
to
call
that
man
husband
that
he
has
been
a
wicked
man
i
have
long
known
but
now
i
hear
he
is
a
criminal
i
hear
it
i
say
but
i
can
get
the
truth
from
none
i
went
to
lord
mount
severn
he
declined
to
give
me
particulars
i
heard
that
carlyle
would
be
in
town
and
i
resolved
to
come
and
ask
them
of
she
delivered
the
sentences
in
a
jerking
abrupt
tone
betraying
her
inward
emotion
carlyle
looking
somewhat
unapproachable
made
no
immediate
reply
you
and
i
have
both
been
deeply
wronged
by
him
carlyle
but
i
brought
my
wrong
upon
myself
you
did
not
my
sister
blanche
whom
he
had
cruelly
treated
and
if
i
speak
of
it
i
only
speak
of
what
is
known
to
the
world
warned
me
against
him
levison
his
grandmother
that
ancient
lady
who
must
now
be
bordering
upon
ninety
she
warned
me
the
night
before
my
wedding
day
she
came
on
purpose
to
tell
me
that
if
i
married
francis
levison
i
should
rue
it
for
life
there
was
yet
time
to
retract
she
said
yes
there
would
have
been
time
but
there
was
no
will
i
would
not
listen
to
either
i
was
led
away
by
vanity
by
folly
by
something
worse
the
triumphing
over
my
own
sister
poor
blanche
but
which
has
the
best
of
the
bargain
now
she
or
i
and
i
have
a
child
she
continued
dropping
her
voice
a
boy
who
inherits
his
father
s
name
carlyle
will
they
condemn
him
nothing
as
yet
is
positively
proved
against
him
replied
carlyle
compassionating
the
unhappy
lady
if
i
could
but
get
a
divorce
she
passionately
uttered
apparently
losing
all
i
might
have
got
one
over
and
over
again
since
we
married
but
there
would
have
been
the
expose
and
the
scandal
if
i
could
but
change
my
child
s
name
tell
me
does
any
chance
of
redress
remain
for
me
there
was
none
and
carlyle
did
not
attempt
to
speak
of
any
he
offered
a
few
kind
words
of
sympathy
very
generally
expressed
and
then
prepared
to
go
out
she
moved
and
stood
in
his
way
you
will
not
leave
until
you
have
given
me
the
particulars
i
pray
you
do
not
i
came
trustingly
to
you
hoping
to
know
i
am
waited
for
to
keep
an
important
engagement
he
answered
and
were
my
time
at
liberty
i
should
decline
to
tell
them
to
you
on
my
own
account
as
well
as
on
yours
lay
not
discourtesy
to
my
charge
lady
levison
were
i
to
speak
of
the
man
even
to
you
his
name
would
blister
my
in
every
word
of
hate
spoken
by
you
i
would
sympathize
every
contemptuous
expression
of
scorn
cast
upon
him
from
your
heart
i
would
join
in
barbara
was
shocked
he
is
your
husband
after
all
she
took
leave
to
whisper
my
husband
broke
forth
lady
levison
in
agitation
seemingly
yes
there
s
the
wrong
why
did
he
knowing
what
he
was
delude
me
into
becoming
his
wife
you
ought
to
feel
for
me
carlyle
and
you
do
feel
for
me
for
you
are
a
wife
and
mother
how
dare
these
base
men
marry
take
to
themselves
an
innocent
inexperienced
girl
vowing
before
god
to
love
and
honor
and
cherish
her
were
not
his
other
sins
impediment
enough
but
he
must
have
crime
also
and
woo
me
he
has
done
me
deep
and
irredeemable
wrong
and
has
entailed
upon
his
child
an
inheritance
of
shame
what
had
he
or
i
done
to
deserve
it
i
ask
barbara
felt
half
frightened
at
her
vehemence
and
barbara
might
be
thankful
not
to
understand
it
all
her
native
gentleness
all
her
reticence
of
feeling
as
a
wife
and
a
gentlewoman
had
been
goaded
out
of
her
the
process
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
but
this
last
revelation
was
the
crowning
point
and
alice
lady
levison
turned
round
upon
the
world
in
her
helpless
resentment
as
any
poor
wife
working
in
a
garret
might
have
done
there
are
certain
wrongs
which
bring
out
human
nature
in
the
as
well
as
in
the
low
still
he
is
your
husband
was
all
barbara
could
with
deprecation
again
plead
he
made
himself
my
husband
by
deceit
and
i
will
throw
him
off
in
the
face
of
day
returned
lady
levison
there
is
no
moral
obligation
why
i
should
not
he
has
worked
ill
and
ruin
ill
and
ruin
upon
me
and
my
child
and
the
world
shall
never
be
allowed
to
think
i
have
borne
my
share
in
it
how
was
it
you
kept
your
hands
off
him
when
he
reappeared
to
brave
you
in
west
lynne
she
added
in
a
changed
tone
turning
to
carlyle
i
can
not
tell
i
was
a
marvel
oftentimes
to
he
quitted
the
room
as
he
spoke
adding
a
few
civil
words
about
her
with
carlyle
barbara
not
possessing
the
scruples
of
her
husband
yielded
to
lady
levison
s
request
and
gave
her
the
outline
of
the
dark
tale
its
outline
only
and
generously
suppressing
afy
s
name
beyond
the
evening
of
the
fatal
event
lady
levison
listened
without
interruption
do
you
and
carlyle
believe
him
to
have
been
guilty
yes
but
carlyle
will
not
express
his
opinion
to
the
world
he
does
not
repay
wrong
with
revenge
i
have
heard
him
say
that
if
the
lifting
of
his
finger
would
send
the
man
to
his
punishment
he
would
tie
down
his
hand
rather
than
lift
was
his
first
wife
isabel
vane
mad
she
presently
asked
mad
echoed
barbara
in
surprise
when
she
quitted
him
for
the
other
it
could
have
been
nothing
else
than
madness
i
could
understand
a
woman
s
flying
from
him
for
love
of
carlyle
but
now
that
i
have
seen
your
husband
i
can
not
understand
the
reverse
side
of
the
picture
i
thank
you
for
your
courtesy
and
without
another
word
alice
levison
quitted
the
room
as
abruptly
as
she
had
entered
it
well
the
london
visit
came
to
an
end
it
was
of
little
more
than
three
weeks
duration
for
barbara
must
be
safe
at
home
again
carlyle
remained
for
the
rest
of
the
season
alone
but
he
varied
it
with
journeys
to
east
lynne
he
had
returned
home
for
good
now
july
although
the
session
had
not
quite
terminated
there
was
another
baby
at
east
lynne
a
lovely
little
baby
pretty
as
barbara
herself
had
been
at
a
month
old
william
was
fading
rapidly
the
london
physicians
had
but
confirmed
the
opinion
of
martin
and
it
was
evident
to
all
that
the
close
would
not
be
long
protracted
somebody
else
was
fading
lady
isabel
the
cross
had
been
too
heavy
and
she
was
sinking
under
its
weight
can
you
wonder
at
it
an
intensely
hot
day
it
was
under
the
july
sun
afy
hallijohn
was
sailing
up
the
street
in
its
beams
finer
and
vainer
than
ever
she
encountered
carlyle
so
afy
you
are
really
going
to
be
married
at
last
jiffin
fancies
so
sir
i
am
not
sure
yet
but
what
i
shall
change
my
mind
jiffin
thinks
there
s
nobody
like
me
if
i
could
eat
gold
and
silver
he
d
provide
it
and
he
s
as
fond
as
fond
can
be
but
then
you
know
sir
he
s
half
soft
as
to
you
perhaps
laughed
carlyle
i
consider
him
a
very
civil
respectable
man
and
then
i
never
did
think
to
marry
a
shopkeeper
grumbled
afy
i
looked
a
little
higher
than
that
only
fancy
sir
having
a
husband
who
wears
a
white
apron
tied
round
him
terrible
responded
carlyle
with
a
grave
face
not
but
what
it
will
be
a
tolerable
settlement
rejoined
afy
veering
round
a
point
he
s
having
his
house
done
up
in
style
and
i
shall
keep
two
good
servants
and
do
nothing
myself
but
dress
and
subscribe
to
the
library
he
makes
plenty
of
a
very
tolerable
settlement
i
should
say
returned
carlyle
and
afy
s
face
fell
before
the
glance
of
his
eye
merry
though
it
was
take
care
you
don
t
spend
all
his
money
for
him
i
ll
take
care
of
that
nodded
afy
significantly
sir
she
somewhat
abruptly
added
what
is
it
that
s
the
matter
with
joyce
i
do
not
know
said
carlyle
becoming
serious
there
does
appear
to
be
something
the
matter
with
her
for
she
is
much
i
never
saw
anybody
so
changed
in
my
life
exclaimed
afy
i
told
her
the
other
day
that
she
was
just
like
one
who
had
got
some
dreadful
secret
upon
their
it
is
really
more
like
that
than
anything
else
observed
carlyle
but
she
is
one
of
the
close
ones
is
joyce
continued
afy
no
fear
that
she
ll
give
out
a
clue
if
it
does
not
suit
her
to
do
so
she
told
me
in
answer
to
mind
my
own
business
and
not
to
take
absurd
fancies
in
my
head
how
is
the
baby
sir
and
carlyle
all
well
good
day
chapter
xlii
the
trial
spacious
courts
were
the
assize
courts
of
lynneborough
and
it
was
well
they
were
so
otherwise
more
people
had
been
disappointed
and
numbers
were
of
hearing
the
noted
trial
of
sir
francis
levison
for
the
murder
of
george
hallijohn
the
circumstances
attending
the
case
caused
it
to
bear
for
the
public
an
unparalleled
interest
the
rank
of
the
accused
and
his
antecedents
more
especially
that
particular
local
antecedent
touching
the
lady
isabel
carlyle
the
verdict
still
out
against
richard
hare
the
length
of
time
which
had
elapsed
since
the
part
played
in
it
by
afy
the
intense
curiosity
as
to
the
part
taken
in
it
by
otway
bethel
the
speculation
as
to
what
had
been
the
exact
details
and
the
doubt
of
a
conviction
all
contributed
to
fan
the
curiosity
of
the
public
people
came
from
far
and
near
to
be
present
friends
of
carlyle
friends
of
the
hares
friends
of
the
challoner
family
friends
of
the
prisoner
besides
the
general
public
colonel
bethel
and
justice
hare
had
conspicuous
seats
at
a
few
minutes
past
nine
the
judge
took
his
place
on
the
bench
but
not
before
a
rumor
had
gone
through
the
court
a
rumor
that
seemed
to
shake
it
to
its
centre
and
which
people
stretched
out
their
necks
to
hear
otway
bethel
had
turned
queen
s
evidence
and
was
to
be
admitted
as
a
witness
for
the
crown
thin
haggard
pale
looked
francis
levison
as
he
was
placed
in
the
dock
his
incarceration
had
not
in
any
way
contributed
to
his
personal
advantages
and
there
was
an
expression
of
dread
upon
his
countenance
not
pleasant
to
look
upon
he
was
dressed
in
black
old
levison
having
died
and
his
diamond
ring
shone
conspicuous
still
on
his
white
hand
now
whiter
than
ever
the
most
eminent
counsel
were
engaged
on
both
sides
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
already
given
need
not
be
recapitulated
the
identification
of
the
prisoner
with
the
man
thorn
was
fully
established
ebenezer
james
proved
that
afy
proved
it
and
also
that
he
thorn
was
at
the
cottage
that
night
sir
peter
levison
s
groom
was
likewise
but
still
there
wanted
other
testimony
afy
was
made
to
that
thorn
had
to
go
to
the
cottage
for
his
hat
after
leaving
her
but
that
proved
nothing
and
the
conversation
or
quarrel
overheard
by
dill
was
now
again
put
forward
if
this
was
all
the
evidence
people
opined
that
the
case
for
the
prosecution
would
break
down
call
richard
hare
said
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
those
present
who
knew
justice
hare
looked
up
at
him
wondering
why
he
did
not
stir
in
answer
to
his
name
wondering
at
the
pallid
hue
which
overspread
his
face
not
he
but
another
came
forward
a
fair
placid
gentlemanly
young
man
with
blue
eyes
fair
hair
and
a
pleasant
countenance
it
was
richard
hare
the
younger
he
had
assumed
his
original
position
in
life
so
far
as
attire
went
and
in
that
at
least
was
a
gentleman
again
in
speech
also
with
his
working
dress
richard
had
thrown
off
his
working
manners
a
strange
hubbub
arose
in
court
richard
hare
the
exile
the
reported
dead
the
man
whose
life
was
in
jeopardy
the
spectators
rose
with
one
accord
to
get
a
better
view
they
stood
on
tiptoe
they
pushed
forth
their
necks
they
strained
their
eyesight
and
amidst
all
the
noisy
hum
the
groan
bursting
from
the
lips
of
justice
hare
was
unnoticed
whilst
order
was
being
called
for
and
the
judge
threatened
to
clear
the
court
two
officers
moved
themselves
quietly
up
and
stood
behind
the
witness
richard
hare
was
in
custody
though
he
might
know
it
not
the
witness
was
sworn
what
is
your
name
richard
son
of
justice
hare
i
believe
of
the
grove
west
lynne
his
only
the
same
against
whom
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
is
out
interposed
the
judge
the
same
my
lord
replied
richard
hare
who
appeared
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
have
cast
away
all
his
old
fearfulness
then
witness
let
me
warn
you
that
you
are
not
obliged
to
answer
any
question
that
may
tend
to
criminate
my
lord
answered
richard
hare
with
some
emotion
i
wish
to
answer
any
and
every
question
put
to
me
i
have
but
one
hope
that
the
full
truth
of
all
pertaining
to
that
fatal
evening
may
be
made
manifest
this
look
round
at
the
prisoner
said
the
examining
counsel
do
you
know
him
i
know
him
now
as
sir
francis
levison
up
to
april
last
i
believed
his
name
to
be
state
what
occurred
on
the
evening
of
the
murder
as
far
as
your
knowledge
i
had
an
appointment
that
evening
with
afy
hallijohn
and
went
down
to
their
cottage
to
keep
it
a
moment
interrupted
the
counsel
was
your
visit
that
evening
made
in
secret
partially
so
my
father
and
mother
were
displeased
naturally
at
my
intimacy
with
afy
hallijohn
therefore
i
did
not
care
that
they
should
be
cognizant
of
my
visits
there
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
i
told
my
father
a
lie
over
it
that
very
evening
he
saw
me
leave
the
to
go
out
with
my
gun
and
inquired
where
i
was
off
to
i
answered
that
i
was
going
out
with
young
when
in
point
of
fact
you
were
not
no
i
took
my
gun
for
i
had
promised
to
lend
it
to
hallijohn
while
his
own
was
being
repaired
when
i
reached
the
cottage
afy
refused
to
admit
me
she
was
busy
and
could
not
she
said
i
felt
sure
she
had
got
thorn
with
her
she
had
more
than
once
before
refused
to
admit
me
when
i
had
gone
there
by
her
own
appointment
and
i
always
found
that
thorn
s
presence
in
the
cottage
was
the
i
suppose
you
and
thorn
were
jealous
of
each
other
i
was
jealous
of
him
i
freely
admit
it
i
don
t
know
whether
he
was
of
may
i
inquire
what
was
the
nature
of
your
friendship
for
miss
afy
hallijohn
i
loved
her
with
an
honorable
love
as
i
might
have
done
by
any
young
lady
in
my
own
station
of
life
i
would
not
have
married
her
in
opposition
to
my
father
and
mother
but
i
told
afy
that
if
she
was
content
to
wait
for
me
until
i
was
my
own
master
i
would
then
make
her
my
you
had
no
views
toward
her
of
a
different
nature
none
i
cared
for
her
too
much
for
that
and
i
respected
her
father
afy
s
mother
had
been
a
lady
too
although
she
had
married
hallijohn
who
was
but
clerk
to
carlyle
no
i
never
had
a
thought
of
wrong
toward
afy
i
never
could
have
now
relate
the
occurrences
of
the
evening
afy
would
not
admit
me
and
we
had
a
few
words
over
it
but
at
length
i
went
away
first
giving
her
the
gun
and
telling
her
it
was
loaded
she
lodged
it
against
the
wall
just
inside
the
door
and
i
went
into
the
wood
and
waited
determined
to
see
whether
or
not
thorn
was
with
her
for
she
had
denied
that
he
was
locksley
saw
me
there
and
asked
why
i
was
hiding
i
did
not
answer
but
i
went
further
off
quite
out
of
view
of
the
cottage
some
time
afterward
less
than
half
an
hour
i
heard
a
shot
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
somebody
was
having
a
late
pop
at
the
partridge
i
thought
just
then
i
saw
otway
bethel
emerge
from
the
trees
not
far
from
me
and
run
toward
the
cottage
my
lord
added
richard
hare
looking
at
the
judge
that
was
the
shot
that
killed
hallijohn
could
the
shot
asked
the
counsel
have
been
fired
by
otway
bethel
it
could
not
it
was
much
further
off
bethel
disappeared
and
in
another
minute
there
came
some
one
flying
down
the
path
leading
from
the
cottage
it
was
thorn
and
evidently
in
a
state
of
intense
terror
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
staring
and
he
panted
and
shook
like
one
in
the
ague
past
me
he
tore
on
down
the
path
and
i
afterwards
heard
the
sound
of
his
horse
galloping
away
it
had
been
tied
in
the
did
you
follow
him
no
i
wondered
what
had
happened
to
put
him
in
that
state
but
i
made
haste
to
the
cottage
intending
to
reproach
afy
with
her
duplicity
i
leaped
up
the
two
steps
and
fell
over
the
prostrate
body
of
hallijohn
he
was
lying
dead
within
the
door
my
gun
just
discharged
was
flung
on
the
floor
its
contents
in
hallijohn
s
you
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
court
so
intense
was
the
interest
there
appeared
to
be
no
one
in
the
cottage
upstairs
or
down
i
called
to
afy
but
she
did
not
answer
i
caught
up
the
gun
and
was
running
from
the
cottage
when
locksley
came
out
of
the
wood
and
looked
at
me
i
grew
confused
fearful
and
i
threw
the
gun
back
again
and
made
what
were
your
motives
for
acting
in
that
way
a
panic
had
come
over
me
and
in
that
moment
i
must
have
lost
the
use
of
my
reason
otherwise
i
never
should
have
acted
as
i
did
thoughts
especially
of
fear
pass
through
our
minds
with
astonishing
swiftness
and
i
feared
lest
the
crime
should
be
fastened
upon
me
it
was
fear
made
me
snatch
up
my
gun
lest
it
should
be
found
near
the
body
it
was
fear
made
me
throw
it
back
again
when
locksley
appeared
in
view
a
fear
you
understand
from
which
all
judgment
all
reason
had
departed
but
for
my
own
conduct
the
charge
never
would
have
been
laid
to
go
in
my
flight
i
came
upon
bethel
i
knew
that
if
he
had
gone
toward
the
cottage
after
the
shot
was
fired
he
must
have
encountered
thorn
flying
from
it
he
denied
that
he
had
he
said
he
had
only
gone
along
the
path
for
a
few
paces
and
had
then
plunged
into
the
wood
again
i
believed
him
and
departed
from
west
lynne
that
night
i
did
it
was
a
foolish
fatal
step
the
result
of
cowardice
i
found
the
charge
was
laid
to
me
and
i
thought
i
would
absent
myself
for
a
day
or
two
to
see
how
things
turned
out
next
came
the
inquest
and
the
verdict
against
me
and
i
then
left
for
this
is
the
truth
so
far
as
you
are
cognizant
of
it
i
swear
that
it
is
truth
and
the
whole
truth
so
far
as
i
am
cognizant
of
it
replied
richard
hare
with
emotion
i
could
not
assert
it
more
solemnly
were
i
before
he
was
subjected
to
a
rigid
but
his
testimony
was
not
shaken
in
the
least
perhaps
not
one
present
but
was
impressed
with
its
truth
afy
hallijohn
was
recalled
and
questioned
as
to
richard
s
presence
at
her
father
s
house
that
night
it
tallied
with
the
account
given
by
richard
but
it
had
to
be
drawn
from
her
why
did
you
decline
to
receive
richard
hare
into
the
cottage
after
appointing
him
to
come
because
i
chose
returned
afy
tell
the
jury
why
you
well
i
had
got
a
friend
with
me
it
was
captain
thorn
she
added
feeling
that
she
should
only
be
questioned
on
this
point
so
might
as
well
acknowledge
it
i
did
not
admit
richard
hare
for
i
fancied
they
might
get
up
a
quarrel
if
they
were
for
what
purpose
did
richard
hare
bring
down
his
gun
do
you
know
it
was
to
lend
to
my
father
my
father
s
gun
had
something
the
matter
with
it
and
was
at
the
smith
s
i
had
heard
him
the
previous
day
ask
richard
to
lend
him
one
of
his
and
richard
said
he
would
bring
one
as
he
you
lodged
the
gun
against
the
wall
safely
quite
was
it
touched
by
you
after
placing
it
there
or
by
the
prisoner
i
did
not
touch
it
neither
did
he
that
i
saw
it
was
that
same
gun
which
was
afterward
found
near
my
father
and
had
been
the
next
witness
called
was
otway
bethel
he
also
held
share
in
the
curiosity
of
the
public
but
not
in
equal
degree
with
afy
still
less
with
richard
hare
the
substance
of
his
testimony
was
as
follows
on
the
evening
that
hallijohn
was
killed
i
was
in
the
abbey
wood
and
i
saw
richard
hare
come
down
the
path
with
a
gun
as
if
he
had
come
down
from
his
own
did
richard
hare
see
you
no
he
could
not
see
me
i
was
right
in
the
thicket
he
went
to
the
cottage
door
and
was
about
to
enter
when
afy
hallijohn
came
hastily
out
of
it
pulling
the
door
to
behind
her
and
holding
it
in
her
hand
as
if
afraid
he
would
go
in
some
colloquy
ensued
but
i
was
too
far
off
to
hear
it
and
then
she
took
the
gun
from
him
and
went
indoors
some
time
after
that
i
saw
richard
hare
amid
the
trees
at
a
distance
farther
off
the
cottage
then
than
i
was
and
apparently
watching
the
path
i
was
wondering
what
he
was
up
to
hiding
there
when
i
head
a
shot
fired
close
as
it
seemed
to
the
cottage
and
stop
a
bit
witness
could
that
shot
have
been
fired
by
richard
hare
it
could
not
he
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
nearly
away
from
it
i
was
much
nearer
the
cottage
than
go
i
could
not
imagine
what
that
shot
meant
or
who
could
have
fired
it
not
that
i
suspected
mischief
and
i
knew
that
poachers
did
not
congregate
so
near
hallijohn
s
cottage
i
set
off
to
reconnoiter
and
as
i
turned
the
corner
which
brought
the
house
within
my
view
i
saw
captain
thorn
as
he
was
called
come
leaping
out
of
it
his
face
was
white
with
terror
his
breath
was
gone
in
short
i
never
saw
any
living
man
betray
so
much
agitation
i
caught
his
arm
as
he
would
have
passed
me
what
have
you
been
about
i
asked
was
it
you
that
fired
he
stay
why
did
you
suspect
him
from
his
state
of
excitement
from
the
terror
he
was
in
that
some
ill
had
happened
i
felt
sure
and
so
would
you
had
you
seen
him
as
i
did
my
arresting
him
increased
his
agitation
he
tried
to
throw
me
off
but
i
am
a
strong
man
and
i
suppose
he
thought
it
best
to
temporize
keep
dark
upon
it
bethel
he
said
i
will
make
it
worth
your
while
the
thing
was
not
premeditated
it
was
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
what
business
had
the
fellow
to
abuse
me
i
have
done
no
harm
to
the
as
he
thus
spoke
he
took
out
a
pocket
book
with
the
hand
that
was
at
liberty
i
held
the
other
as
the
prisoner
thus
spoke
you
mean
the
prisoner
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
book
and
thrust
it
into
my
hands
it
was
a
note
for
fifty
pounds
what
s
done
can
t
be
undone
bethel
he
said
and
your
saying
that
you
saw
me
here
can
serve
no
good
turn
shall
it
be
silence
i
took
the
note
and
answered
that
it
should
be
silence
i
had
not
the
least
idea
that
anybody
was
what
did
you
suppose
had
happened
then
i
could
not
suppose
i
could
not
think
it
all
passed
in
the
haste
and
confusion
of
a
moment
and
no
definite
idea
occurred
to
me
thorn
flew
on
down
the
path
and
i
stood
looking
after
him
the
next
was
i
heard
footsteps
and
i
slipped
within
the
trees
they
were
those
of
richard
hare
who
took
the
path
to
the
cottage
presently
he
returned
little
less
agitated
than
thorn
had
been
i
had
gone
into
an
open
space
then
and
he
accosted
me
asking
if
i
had
seen
that
hound
fly
from
the
cottage
what
hound
i
asked
of
him
that
fine
fellow
that
thorn
who
comes
after
afy
he
answered
but
i
stoutly
denied
that
i
had
seen
any
one
richard
hare
continued
his
way
and
i
afterward
found
that
hallijohn
was
and
so
you
took
a
bribe
to
conceal
one
of
the
foulest
crimes
that
man
ever
committed
otway
bethel
i
took
the
money
and
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
it
but
it
was
done
without
reflection
i
swear
that
had
i
known
what
crime
it
was
intended
to
hush
up
i
never
would
have
touched
it
i
was
hard
up
for
funds
and
the
amount
tempted
me
when
i
discovered
what
had
really
happened
and
that
richard
hare
was
accused
i
was
thunderstruck
at
my
own
deed
many
a
hundred
times
since
have
i
cursed
the
money
and
the
fate
of
richard
has
been
as
a
heavy
weight
upon
my
you
might
have
lifted
the
weight
by
to
what
end
it
was
too
late
thorn
had
disappeared
i
never
heard
of
him
or
saw
him
until
he
came
to
west
lynne
this
last
spring
as
sir
francis
levison
to
oppose
carlyle
richard
hare
had
also
disappeared
had
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
and
most
people
supposed
he
was
dead
to
what
end
then
should
i
confess
perhaps
only
to
be
suspected
myself
besides
i
had
taken
the
money
upon
a
certain
understanding
and
it
was
only
fair
that
i
should
keep
to
if
richard
hare
was
subjected
to
a
severe
a
far
more
severe
one
was
awaiting
otway
bethel
the
judge
spoke
to
him
only
once
his
tone
ringing
with
reproach
it
appears
then
witness
that
you
have
retained
within
you
all
these
years
the
proofs
of
richard
hare
s
innocence
i
can
only
acknowledge
it
with
contrition
my
what
did
you
know
of
thorn
in
those
days
asked
the
counsel
nothing
save
that
he
frequented
the
abbey
wood
his
object
being
afy
hallijohn
i
had
never
exchanged
a
word
with
him
until
that
night
but
i
knew
his
name
thorn
at
least
the
one
he
went
by
and
by
his
addressing
me
as
bethel
it
appeared
that
he
knew
the
case
for
the
prosecution
closed
an
able
and
ingenious
speech
was
made
for
the
defence
the
learned
counsel
who
offered
it
contending
that
there
was
still
no
proof
of
sir
francis
having
been
the
guilty
man
neither
was
there
any
proof
that
the
catastrophe
was
not
the
result
of
pure
accident
a
loaded
gun
standing
against
a
wall
in
a
small
room
was
not
a
safe
weapon
and
he
called
upon
the
jury
not
rashly
to
convict
in
the
uncertainty
but
to
give
the
prisoner
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
he
should
call
no
witnesses
he
observed
not
even
to
character
character
for
sir
francis
levison
the
court
burst
into
a
grin
the
only
sober
face
in
it
being
that
of
the
judge
the
judge
summed
up
certainly
not
in
the
prisoner
s
favor
but
to
use
the
expression
of
some
amidst
the
audience
dead
against
him
otway
bethel
came
in
for
a
side
shaft
or
two
from
his
lordship
richard
hare
for
sympathy
the
jury
retired
about
four
o
clock
and
the
judge
quitted
the
bench
a
very
short
time
they
were
absent
scarcely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
lordship
returned
into
court
and
the
prisoner
was
again
placed
in
the
dock
he
was
the
hue
of
marble
and
in
his
nervous
agitation
kept
incessantly
throwing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
the
action
already
spoken
of
silence
was
proclaimed
how
say
you
gentlemen
of
the
jury
guilty
or
not
guilty
it
was
a
silence
to
be
felt
and
the
prisoner
gasped
once
or
twice
convulsively
but
said
the
foreman
we
wish
to
recommend
him
to
on
what
grounds
inquired
the
judge
because
my
lord
we
believe
it
was
not
a
crime
planned
by
the
prisoner
beforehand
but
arose
out
of
the
bad
passions
of
the
moment
and
was
so
the
judge
paused
and
drew
something
black
from
the
receptacle
of
his
pocket
buried
deep
in
his
robes
prisoner
at
the
bar
have
you
anything
to
urge
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
upon
you
the
prisoner
clutched
the
front
of
the
dock
he
threw
up
his
head
as
if
shaking
off
the
dread
fear
which
had
oppressed
him
and
the
marble
of
his
face
changed
to
scarlet
only
this
my
lord
the
jury
in
giving
their
reason
for
recommending
me
to
your
lordship
s
mercy
have
adopted
the
right
view
of
the
case
as
it
actually
occurred
the
man
hallijohn
s
life
was
taken
by
me
it
will
be
useless
for
me
to
deny
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
given
this
day
but
it
was
not
taken
in
malice
when
i
quitted
the
girl
afy
and
went
to
the
cottage
for
my
hat
i
no
more
contemplated
injuring
mortal
man
than
i
contemplate
it
at
this
moment
he
was
there
the
father
and
in
the
dispute
that
ensued
the
catastrophe
occurred
my
lord
it
was
not
wilful
the
prisoner
ceased
and
the
judge
the
black
cap
on
his
head
crossed
his
hands
one
upon
the
other
prisoner
at
the
bar
you
have
been
convicted
by
clear
and
undoubted
evidence
of
the
crime
of
wilful
murder
the
jury
have
pronounced
you
guilty
and
in
their
verdict
i
entirely
coincide
that
you
took
the
life
of
that
and
unoffending
man
there
is
no
doubt
you
have
yourself
confessed
it
it
was
a
foul
a
barbarous
a
wicked
act
i
care
not
for
what
may
have
been
the
particular
circumstances
attending
it
he
may
have
provoked
you
by
words
but
no
provocation
of
that
nature
could
justify
your
drawing
the
gun
upon
him
your
counsel
urged
that
you
were
a
gentleman
a
member
of
the
british
aristocracy
and
therefore
deserved
consideration
i
confess
that
i
was
much
surprised
to
hear
such
a
doctrine
fall
from
his
lips
in
my
opinion
you
being
what
you
are
your
position
in
life
makes
your
crime
the
worse
and
i
have
always
maintained
that
when
a
man
possessed
of
advantages
falls
into
sin
he
deserves
less
consideration
than
does
one
who
is
poor
simple
and
uneducated
certain
portions
of
the
evidence
given
and
i
do
not
now
allude
to
the
actual
crime
tell
very
greatly
against
you
and
i
am
sure
not
one
in
the
court
but
must
have
turned
from
them
with
abhorrence
you
were
pursuing
the
daughter
of
this
man
with
no
honorable
purpose
and
in
this
point
your
conduct
contrasts
badly
with
the
avowal
of
richard
hare
equally
a
gentleman
with
yourself
in
this
pursuit
you
killed
her
father
and
not
content
with
that
you
still
pursued
the
girl
and
pursued
her
to
ruin
basely
deceiving
her
as
to
the
actual
facts
and
laying
the
crime
upon
another
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
speak
further
upon
this
point
nor
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
it
is
not
to
answer
for
that
that
you
stand
before
me
uncalled
unprepared
and
by
you
unpitied
you
hurried
that
unfortunate
man
into
eternity
and
you
must
now
expiate
the
crime
with
your
own
life
the
jury
have
recommended
you
to
mercy
and
the
recommendation
will
be
forwarded
in
due
course
to
the
proper
quarter
but
you
must
be
aware
how
frequently
this
clause
is
appended
to
a
verdict
and
how
very
rarely
it
is
attended
to
just
cause
being
wanting
i
can
but
enjoin
you
and
i
do
so
most
earnestly
to
pass
the
little
time
that
probably
remains
to
you
on
earth
in
seeking
repentance
and
forgiveness
you
are
best
aware
yourself
what
your
past
life
has
been
the
world
knows
somewhat
of
it
but
there
is
pardon
above
for
the
most
guilty
when
it
is
earnestly
sought
it
now
only
remains
for
me
to
pass
the
sentence
of
the
law
it
is
that
you
francis
levison
be
taken
back
to
the
place
from
whence
you
came
and
thence
to
the
place
of
execution
and
that
you
be
there
hanged
by
the
neck
until
you
are
dead
and
may
the
lord
god
almighty
have
mercy
on
your
soul
amen
the
court
was
cleared
the
day
s
excitement
was
over
and
the
next
case
was
inquired
for
not
quite
over
however
yet
the
excitement
and
the
audience
crowded
in
again
for
the
next
case
proved
to
be
the
arraignment
of
richard
hare
the
younger
a
formal
proceeding
merely
in
pursuance
of
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
s
inquest
no
evidence
was
offered
against
him
and
the
judge
ordered
him
to
be
discharged
richard
poor
baited
richard
was
a
free
man
again
then
ensued
the
scene
of
all
scenes
half
at
least
of
those
present
were
residents
of
or
from
near
west
lynne
they
had
known
richard
hare
from
infancy
they
had
admired
the
boy
in
his
pretty
childhood
they
had
liked
him
in
his
unoffending
boyhood
but
they
had
been
none
the
less
ready
to
cast
their
harsh
stones
at
him
and
to
thunder
down
their
denunciations
when
the
time
came
in
proportion
to
their
fierceness
then
was
their
contrition
now
richard
had
been
innocent
all
the
while
they
had
been
more
guilty
than
he
an
english
mob
gentle
or
simple
never
gets
up
its
excitement
by
halves
whether
its
demonstration
be
of
a
laudatory
or
a
condemnatory
nature
the
steam
is
sure
to
be
put
on
to
bursting
point
with
one
universal
shout
with
one
bound
they
rallied
round
richard
they
congratulated
him
they
overwhelmed
him
with
good
wishes
they
expressed
with
shame
their
repentance
they
said
the
future
would
atone
for
the
past
had
he
possessed
a
hundred
hands
they
would
have
been
shaken
off
and
when
richard
extracted
himself
and
turned
in
his
pleasant
forgiving
loving
nature
to
his
father
the
stern
old
justice
forgetting
his
pride
and
pomposity
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
like
a
child
as
he
murmured
something
about
his
also
needing
forgiveness
dear
father
cried
richard
his
own
eyes
wet
it
is
forgiven
and
forgotten
already
think
how
happy
we
shall
be
again
together
you
and
i
and
my
the
justice
s
hands
which
had
been
wound
around
his
son
relaxed
their
hold
they
were
twitching
curiously
the
body
also
began
to
twitch
and
he
fell
upon
the
shoulder
of
colonel
bethel
in
a
second
stroke
of
paralysis
chapter
xliii
the
death
chamber
by
the
side
of
william
carlyle
s
dying
bed
knelt
the
lady
isabel
the
time
was
at
hand
and
the
boy
was
quite
reconciled
to
his
fate
merciful
indeed
is
god
to
dying
children
it
is
astonishing
how
very
readily
when
the
right
means
are
taken
they
may
be
brought
to
look
with
pleasure
rather
than
fear
upon
their
unknown
journey
the
brilliant
hectic
type
of
the
disease
had
gone
from
his
cheeks
his
features
were
white
and
wasted
and
his
eyes
large
and
bright
his
silky
brown
hair
was
pushed
off
his
temples
and
his
little
hot
hands
were
thrown
outside
the
bed
it
won
t
be
very
long
to
wait
you
know
will
it
madame
vine
for
what
darling
before
they
all
come
papa
and
mamma
and
lucy
and
all
of
a
jealous
feeling
shot
across
her
wearied
heart
was
she
nothing
to
him
do
you
not
care
that
i
should
come
to
you
william
yes
i
hope
you
will
but
do
you
think
we
shall
know
everybody
in
heaven
or
will
it
be
only
our
own
relations
oh
child
i
think
there
will
be
no
relations
as
you
call
it
up
there
we
can
trust
all
that
to
god
however
it
may
william
lay
looking
upward
at
the
sky
apparently
in
thought
a
dark
blue
serene
sky
from
which
shone
the
hot
july
sun
his
bed
had
been
moved
toward
the
window
for
he
liked
to
sit
in
it
and
look
at
the
landscape
the
window
was
open
now
and
the
butterflies
and
bees
sported
in
the
summer
air
i
wonder
how
it
will
be
pondered
he
aloud
there
will
be
the
beautiful
city
its
gates
of
pearl
and
its
shining
precious
stones
and
its
streets
of
gold
and
there
will
be
the
clear
river
and
the
trees
with
their
fruits
and
their
healing
leaves
and
the
lovely
flowers
and
there
will
be
the
harps
and
music
and
singing
and
what
else
will
there
be
everything
that
is
desirable
and
beautiful
william
but
what
we
may
not
anticipate
another
pause
madame
vine
will
jesus
come
for
me
do
you
think
or
will
he
send
an
angel
jesus
has
promised
to
come
for
his
own
redeemed
for
those
who
love
him
and
wait
for
yes
yes
and
then
i
shall
be
happy
forever
it
will
be
so
pleasant
to
be
there
never
to
be
tired
or
ill
pleasant
ay
oh
william
would
that
the
time
were
come
she
was
thinking
of
herself
of
her
freedom
though
the
boy
knew
it
not
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
continued
speaking
william
had
to
bend
his
ear
to
catch
the
faint
whisper
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
madame
vine
do
you
think
mamma
will
be
there
he
presently
asked
i
mean
mamma
that
ay
ere
but
how
shall
i
know
her
you
see
i
have
nearly
forgotten
what
she
was
she
leaned
over
him
laying
her
forehead
upon
his
wasted
arm
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
impassioned
tears
you
will
know
her
never
fear
william
she
has
not
forgotten
but
how
can
we
be
sure
that
she
will
be
there
debated
william
after
a
pause
of
thought
you
know
sinking
his
voice
and
speaking
with
hesitation
she
was
not
quite
good
she
was
not
good
enough
to
papa
or
to
us
sometimes
i
think
suppose
she
did
not
grow
good
and
did
not
ask
god
to
forgive
her
oh
william
sobbed
the
unhappy
lady
her
whole
life
after
she
left
you
was
one
long
scene
of
repentance
of
seeking
forgiveness
her
repentance
her
sorrow
was
greater
than
she
could
bear
and
and
what
asked
william
for
there
was
a
pause
her
heart
broke
in
it
yearning
after
you
and
your
what
makes
you
think
it
child
i
know
it
william
considered
then
had
he
been
strong
enough
he
would
have
started
up
with
energy
madame
vine
you
could
only
know
that
by
mamma
s
telling
you
did
you
ever
see
her
did
you
know
her
abroad
lady
isabel
s
thoughts
were
far
away
up
in
the
clouds
perhaps
she
reflected
not
on
the
possible
consequences
of
her
answer
or
she
had
never
given
it
yes
i
knew
her
oh
said
the
boy
why
did
you
never
tell
us
what
did
she
say
what
was
she
like
she
said
sobbing
wildly
that
she
was
parted
from
her
children
here
but
she
should
meet
them
in
heaven
and
be
with
them
forever
william
darling
all
the
awful
pain
and
sadness
and
guilt
of
this
world
will
be
washed
out
and
god
will
wipe
your
tears
what
was
her
face
like
he
questioned
softly
like
yours
very
much
like
lucy
was
she
pretty
a
momentary
pause
oh
dear
i
am
ill
hold
me
cried
out
william
as
his
head
sank
to
one
side
and
great
drops
as
large
as
peas
broke
forth
upon
his
clammy
face
it
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
temporary
faint
attacks
that
overpowered
him
at
times
lately
and
lady
isabel
rang
the
bell
hastily
wilson
came
in
in
answer
joyce
was
the
usual
attendant
upon
the
sick
room
but
carlyle
with
her
infant
was
passing
the
day
at
the
grove
unconscious
of
the
critical
state
of
william
and
she
had
taken
joyce
with
her
it
was
the
day
following
the
trial
justice
hare
had
been
brought
to
west
lynne
in
his
second
attack
and
barbara
had
gone
to
see
him
to
console
her
mother
and
to
welcome
richard
to
his
home
again
if
one
carriage
drove
that
day
to
the
grove
with
cards
and
inquiries
fifty
did
not
to
speak
of
the
foot
callers
it
is
all
meant
by
way
of
attention
to
you
richard
said
gentle
hare
smiling
through
her
loving
tears
at
her
restored
son
lucy
and
archie
were
dining
at
miss
carlyle
s
and
sarah
attended
little
arthur
leaving
wilson
free
she
came
in
in
answer
to
madame
vine
s
ring
is
he
off
in
another
faint
unceremoniously
cried
she
hastening
to
the
bed
i
think
so
help
to
raise
william
did
not
faint
no
the
attack
was
quite
different
from
those
he
was
subject
to
instead
of
losing
consciousness
and
power
as
was
customary
he
shook
as
if
he
had
the
ague
and
laid
hold
both
of
madame
vine
and
wilson
grasping
them
convulsively
don
t
let
me
fall
don
t
let
me
fall
he
gasped
my
dear
you
can
not
fall
responded
madame
vine
you
forget
that
you
are
on
the
he
clasped
them
yet
and
trembled
still
as
from
fear
don
t
let
me
fall
don
t
let
me
fall
the
incessant
burden
of
his
cry
the
paroxysm
passed
they
wiped
his
brow
and
stood
looking
at
him
wilson
with
a
pursed
up
mouth
and
a
peculiar
expression
of
face
she
put
a
spoonful
of
restorative
jelly
between
his
lips
and
he
swallowed
it
but
shook
his
head
when
she
would
have
given
him
another
turning
his
face
to
the
pillow
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
in
a
doze
what
could
it
have
been
exclaimed
lady
isabel
in
an
undertone
to
wilson
i
know
was
the
oracular
answer
i
saw
this
same
sort
of
an
attack
once
before
and
what
caused
it
twasn
t
in
a
child
though
went
on
wilson
twas
in
a
grown
person
but
that
s
nothing
it
comes
for
the
same
thing
in
all
i
think
he
was
taken
for
who
uttered
lady
isabel
startled
wilson
made
no
reply
in
words
but
she
pointed
with
her
finger
to
the
bed
oh
wilson
he
is
not
so
ill
as
that
wainwright
said
this
morning
that
he
might
last
a
week
or
wilson
composedly
sat
herself
down
in
the
easiest
chair
she
was
not
wont
to
put
herself
out
of
the
way
for
the
governess
and
that
governess
was
too
much
afraid
of
her
in
one
sense
to
let
her
know
her
place
as
to
wainwright
he
s
nobody
quoth
she
and
if
he
saw
the
child
s
breath
going
out
before
his
face
and
knew
that
the
next
moment
would
be
his
last
he
d
vow
to
us
all
that
he
was
good
for
twelve
hours
to
come
you
don
t
know
wainwright
as
i
do
madame
he
was
our
doctor
at
mother
s
and
he
has
attended
in
all
the
places
i
have
lived
in
since
i
went
out
to
service
five
years
i
was
maid
at
hare
s
i
came
here
when
miss
lucy
was
a
baby
and
in
all
my
places
has
he
attended
like
one
s
shadow
my
lady
isabel
thought
great
guns
of
old
wainwright
i
remember
it
was
more
than
i
my
lady
isabel
made
no
response
to
this
she
took
a
seat
and
watched
william
through
her
glasses
his
breathing
was
more
labored
than
usual
that
idiot
sarah
says
to
me
says
she
which
of
his
two
grandpapas
will
they
bury
him
by
old
carlyle
or
lord
mount
severn
don
t
be
a
calf
i
answered
her
d
ye
think
they
ll
stick
him
out
in
the
corner
with
my
lord
he
ll
be
put
into
the
carlyle
vault
of
course
it
would
have
been
different
you
see
madame
vine
if
my
lady
had
died
at
home
all
proper
carlyle
s
wife
they
d
have
buried
her
no
doubt
by
her
father
and
the
boy
would
have
been
laid
with
her
but
she
did
no
reply
was
made
by
madame
vine
and
a
silence
ensued
nothing
to
be
heard
but
that
fleeting
breath
i
wonder
how
that
beauty
feels
suddenly
broke
forth
wilson
again
her
tone
one
of
scornful
irony
lady
isabel
her
eyes
and
her
thoughts
absorbed
by
william
positively
thought
wilson
s
words
must
relate
to
him
she
turned
to
her
in
surprise
that
bright
gem
in
the
prison
at
lynneborough
exclaimed
wilson
i
hope
he
may
have
found
himself
pretty
well
since
yesterday
i
wonder
how
many
trainfuls
from
west
lynne
will
go
to
his
hanging
isabel
s
face
turned
crimson
her
heart
sick
she
had
not
dared
to
inquire
how
the
trial
terminated
the
subject
altogether
was
too
dreadful
and
nobody
had
happened
to
mention
it
in
her
hearing
is
he
condemned
she
breathed
in
a
low
tone
he
is
condemned
and
good
luck
to
him
and
otway
bethel
s
let
loose
again
and
good
luck
to
him
a
nice
pair
they
are
nobody
went
from
this
house
to
hear
the
trial
it
might
not
have
been
pleasant
you
know
to
carlyle
but
people
came
in
last
night
and
told
us
all
about
it
young
richard
hare
chiefly
convicted
him
he
is
back
again
and
so
looking
they
say
ten
times
more
so
than
he
was
when
quite
a
young
man
you
should
have
heard
they
say
the
cheering
and
shouts
that
greeted
richard
when
his
innocence
came
out
it
pretty
near
rose
off
the
roof
of
the
court
and
the
judge
didn
t
stop
wilson
paused
but
there
was
no
answering
comment
on
she
went
again
when
carlyle
brought
the
news
home
last
evening
and
broke
it
to
his
wife
telling
her
how
richard
had
been
received
with
acclamations
she
nearly
fainted
for
she
s
not
strong
yet
carlyle
called
out
to
me
to
bring
some
water
i
was
in
the
next
room
with
the
baby
and
there
she
was
the
tears
raining
from
her
eyes
and
he
holding
her
to
him
i
always
said
there
was
a
whole
world
of
love
between
those
two
though
he
did
go
and
marry
another
carlyle
ordered
me
to
put
the
water
down
and
sent
me
away
again
but
i
don
t
fancy
he
told
her
of
old
hare
s
attack
until
this
lady
isabel
lifted
her
aching
forehead
what
attack
why
madame
don
t
you
know
i
declare
you
box
yourself
up
in
the
house
keeping
from
everybody
and
you
hear
nothing
you
might
as
well
be
living
at
the
bottom
of
a
old
hare
had
another
stroke
in
the
court
at
lynneborough
and
that
s
why
my
mistress
is
gone
to
the
grove
who
says
richard
hare
s
come
home
wilson
the
question
the
weak
scarcely
audible
question
had
come
from
the
dying
boy
wilson
threw
up
her
hands
and
made
a
bound
to
the
bed
the
like
of
that
she
uttered
aside
to
vine
one
never
knows
when
to
take
these
sick
ones
master
william
you
hold
your
tongue
and
drop
to
sleep
again
your
papa

be
home

from
lynneborough
and

and
get
tired
he
ll
say
it
s
my
fault
come
shut
your
eyes
will
you
have
a
bit
more
jelly
william
making
no
reply
to
the
offer
of
jelly
buried
his
face
again
on
the
pillow
but
he
was
grievously
restless
the
nearly
spirit
was
ebbing
and
flowing
carlyle
was
at
lynneborough
he
always
had
much
business
there
at
assize
time
and
the
nisi
prius
court
but
the
previous
day
he
had
not
gone
himself
dill
had
been
dispatched
to
represent
him
between
seven
and
eight
he
returned
home
and
came
into
william
s
chamber
the
boy
brightened
up
at
the
presence
papa
carlyle
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
kissed
him
the
passing
beams
of
the
sun
slanting
from
the
horizon
shone
into
the
room
and
carlyle
could
view
well
the
dying
face
the
gray
hue
of
death
was
certainly
on
it
is
he
worse
he
exclaimed
hastily
to
madame
vine
who
was
jacketed
and
capped
and
spectacled
and
tied
up
round
the
throat
and
otherwise
disguised
in
her
universal
fashion
he
appears
worse
this
evening
sir
more
papa
panted
william
is
the
trial
over
what
trial

boy

francis
levison
it
was
over
yesterday

your
head
about
him

brave
boy

is
sentenced
to
did
he
kill
hallijohn
yes
who
has
been
talking
to
him
upon
the
subject
carlyle
continued
to
madame
vine
with
marked
displeasure
in
his
tone
wilson
mentioned
it
sir
was
the
low
answer
oh
papa
what
will
he
do
will
jesus
forgive
him
we
must
hope
do
you
hope
it
papa
yes
i
wish
that
all
the
world
may
be
forgiven
william
whatever
may
have
been
their
sins
my
child
how
restless
you
seem
i
can
t
keep
in
one
place
the
bed
gets
wrong
pull
me
up
on
the
pillow
will
you
madame
vine
carlyle
gently
lifted
the
boy
himself
madame
vine
is
an
untiring
nurse
to
you
william
he
observed
gratefully
casting
a
glance
toward
her
in
the
distance
where
she
had
retreated
and
was
shaded
by
the
window
curtain
william
made
no
reply
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
recall
something
i
forget
i
forget
forget
what
asked
carlyle
it
was
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
or
to
tell
you
isn
t
lucy
come
home
i
suppose
papa
i
want
i
will
send
her
home
to
you
i
am
going
for
your
mamma
after
for
mamma
oh
i
remember
now
papa
how
shall
i
know
mamma
in
heaven
not
this
carlyle
did
not
immediately
reply
the
question
may
have
puzzled
him
william
continued
hastily
possibly
mistaking
the
motive
of
the
silence
she
will
be
in
heaven
you
yes
yes
child
speaking
hurriedly
madame
vine
knows
she
will
she
saw
her
abroad
and
mamma
told
her
that
what
was
it
madame
madame
vine
grew
sick
with
alarm
carlyle
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
scarlet
face
as
much
as
he
could
get
to
see
of
it
she
would
have
escaped
from
the
room
if
she
could
mamma
was
more
sorry
than
she
could
bear
went
on
william
finding
he
was
not
helped
she
wanted
you
papa
and
she
wanted
us
and
her
heart
broke
and
she
a
flush
rose
to
carlyle
s
brow
he
turned
inquiringly
to
madame
vine
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
she
murmured
with
desperate
energy
i
ought
not
to
have
spoken
i
ought
not
to
have
interfered
in
your
family
affairs
i
spoke
only
as
i
thought
it
must
be
sir
the
boy
seemed
troubled
about
his
carlyle
was
at
sea
did
you
meet
his
mother
abroad
i
scarcely
she
lifted
her
hand
and
covered
her
glowing
face
no
surely
the
recording
angel
blotted
out
the
words
if
ever
a
prayer
for
forgiveness
went
up
from
an
aching
heart
it
must
have
gone
up
then
for
the
equivocation
over
her
child
s
carlyle
went
toward
her
do
you
perceive
the
change
in
his
countenance
he
whispered
yes
sir
he
has
looked
like
this
since
a
strange
fit
of
trembling
that
came
on
in
the
afternoon
wilson
thought
he
might
be
taken
for
death
i
fear
that
some
four
and
twenty
hours
will
end
carlyle
rested
his
elbow
on
the
window
frame
and
his
hand
upon
his
brow
his
drooping
eyelids
falling
over
his
eyes
it
is
hard
to
lose
oh
sir
he
will
be
better
off
she
wailed
choking
down
the
sobs
and
the
emotion
that
arose
threateningly
we
can
bear
death
it
is
not
the
worst
parting
that
the
earth
knows
he
will
be
quit
of
this
cruel
world
sheltered
in
heaven
i
wish
we
were
all
there
a
servant
came
to
say
that
carlyle
s
dinner
was
served
and
he
proceeded
to
it
with
what
appetite
he
had
when
he
returned
to
the
sick
room
the
daylight
had
faded
and
a
solitary
candle
was
placed
where
its
rays
could
not
fall
upon
the
child
s
face
carlyle
took
the
light
in
his
hand
to
scan
that
face
again
he
was
lying
sideways
on
the
pillow
his
hollow
breath
echoing
through
the
room
the
light
caused
him
to
open
his
eyes
don
t
papa
please
i
like
it
only
for
a
moment
my
precious
and
not
for
more
than
a
moment
did
carlyle
hold
it
the
blue
pinched
ghastly
look
was
there
yet
death
was
certainly
coming
on
quick
at
that
moment
lucy
and
archibald
came
in
on
their
return
from
their
visit
to
miss
carlyle
the
dying
boy
looked
up
eagerly
lucy
he
said
putting
out
his
cold
damp
hand
i
am
not
going
out
replied
lucy
we
have
but
just
come
lucy
repeated
he
she
laid
hold
of
the
little
hand
then
leaned
over
and
kissed
him
william
but
indeed
i
am
not
going
out
i
am
said
he
i
am
going
to
heaven
where
s
archie
carlyle
lifted
archie
on
to
the
bed
lucy
looked
frightened
archie
surprised
archie
dear
i
am
going
to
heaven
to
that
bright
blue
sky
you
know
i
shall
see
mamma
there
and
i
ll
tell
her
that
you
and
lucy
are
coming
lucy
a
sensitive
child
broke
into
a
loud
storm
of
sobs
enough
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
any
sober
sick
room
wilson
hastened
in
at
the
sound
and
carlyle
sent
the
two
children
away
with
soothing
promises
that
they
should
see
william
in
the
morning
if
he
continued
well
enough
down
on
her
knees
her
face
buried
in
the
counterpane
a
corner
of
it
stuffed
into
her
mouth
that
it
might
help
to
stifle
her
agony
knelt
lady
isabel
the
moment
s
excitement
was
well
nigh
beyond
her
strength
of
endurance
her
own
child
his
child
they
alone
around
its
and
she
might
not
ask
or
receive
a
word
of
comfort
of
consolation
carlyle
glanced
at
her
as
he
caught
her
choking
sobs
just
as
he
would
have
glanced
at
any
other
attentive
governess
feeling
her
sympathy
doubtless
but
nothing
more
she
was
not
heart
and
part
with
him
and
his
departing
boy
lower
and
lower
bent
he
over
that
boy
for
his
eyes
were
wet
don
t
cry
papa
whispered
william
raising
his
feeble
hand
caressingly
to
his
father
s
cheek
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
jesus
is
coming
for
afraid
to
go
indeed
i
hope
not
my
gentle
boy
you
are
going
to
god
to
happiness
a
few
years
we
know
not
how
few
and
we
shall
all
come
to
yes
you
will
be
sure
to
come
i
know
that
i
shall
tell
mamma
so
i
dare
say
she
is
looking
out
for
me
now
perhaps
she
s
standing
on
the
banks
of
the
river
watching
the
he
had
evidently
got
that
picture
of
martin
s
in
his
mind
the
plains
of
carlyle
turned
to
the
table
he
saw
some
strawberry
juice
pressed
from
the
fresh
fruit
and
moistened
with
it
the
boy
s
fevered
lips
papa
i
can
t
think
how
jesus
can
be
in
all
the
boats
perhaps
they
don
t
go
quite
at
the
same
time
he
must
be
you
know
because
he
comes
to
fetch
he
will
be
yours
darling
was
the
whispered
fervent
answer
oh
yes
he
will
take
me
all
the
way
up
to
god
and
say
here
s
a
poor
little
boy
come
you
must
please
to
forgive
him
and
let
him
go
into
heaven
because
i
died
for
him
papa
did
you
know
that
mamma
s
heart
broke
william
i
think
it
likely
that
your
poor
mamma
s
heart
did
break
ere
death
came
but
let
us
talk
of
you
not
of
her
are
you
in
pain
i
can
t
breathe
i
can
t
swallow
i
wish
joyce
was
she
will
not
be
long
the
boy
nestled
himself
in
his
father
s
arms
and
in
a
few
minutes
appeared
to
be
asleep
carlyle
after
a
while
gently
laid
him
on
his
pillow
and
watched
him
and
then
turned
to
depart
oh
papa
papa
he
cried
out
in
a
tone
of
painful
entreaty
opening
wide
his
yearning
eyes
say
to
me
carlyle
s
tears
fell
upon
the
little
upturned
face
as
he
once
more
caught
it
to
his
breast
my
darling
your
papa
will
soon
be
back
he
is
going
to
bring
mamma
to
see
and
pretty
little
baby
anna
and
baby
anna
if
you
would
like
her
to
come
in
i
will
not
leave
my
darling
boy
for
long
he
need
not
fear
i
shall
not
leave
you
again
night
william
when
once
i
am
then
put
me
down
and
go
a
lingering
embrace
a
fond
lingering
tearful
embrace
carlyle
holding
him
to
his
beating
heart
then
he
laid
him
comfortably
on
his
pillow
gave
him
a
teaspoonful
of
strawberry
juice
and
hastened
away
papa
came
forth
the
little
feeble
cry
it
was
not
heard
carlyle
was
gone
gone
from
his
living
child
forever
up
rose
lady
isabel
and
flung
her
arms
aloft
in
a
storm
of
sobs
oh
william
darling
in
this
dying
moment
let
me
be
to
you
as
your
mother
again
he
unclosed
his
wearied
eyelids
it
is
probable
that
he
only
partially
understood
papa
s
gone
for
not
her
i
i
lady
isabel
checked
herself
and
fell
sobbing
on
the
bed
no
not
even
at
the
last
hour
when
the
world
was
closing
on
him
dared
she
say
i
am
your
mother
wilson
he
looks
as
if
he
were
dropping
off
to
sleep
quoth
she
yes
said
lady
isabel
you
need
not
wait
wilson
i
will
ring
if
he
requires
wilson
though
withal
not
a
woman
was
not
one
to
remain
for
pleasure
in
a
if
told
she
might
leave
it
she
lady
isabel
remained
alone
she
fell
on
her
knees
again
this
time
in
prayer
for
the
departing
spirit
on
its
wing
and
that
god
would
mercifully
vouchsafe
herself
a
with
it
in
heaven
a
review
of
the
past
then
rose
up
before
her
from
the
time
of
her
first
entering
that
house
the
bride
of
carlyle
to
her
present
sojourn
in
it
the
old
scenes
passed
through
her
mind
like
the
changing
picture
in
a
phantasmagoria
why
should
they
have
come
there
and
then
she
knew
not
william
slept
on
silently
she
thought
of
the
past
the
dreadful
reflection
if
i
had
not
done
as
i
did
how
different
would
it
have
been
now
had
been
sounding
its
knell
in
her
heart
so
often
that
she
had
almost
ceased
to
shudder
at
it
the
very
nails
of
her
hands
had
before
now
entered
the
palms
with
the
sharp
pain
it
brought
stealing
over
her
more
especially
this
night
there
as
she
knelt
her
head
lying
on
the
counterpane
came
the
recollection
of
that
first
illness
of
hers
how
she
had
lain
and
in
that
unfounded
jealousy
imagined
barbara
the
house
s
mistress
she
dead
barbara
exalted
to
her
place
carlyle
s
wife
her
child
s
stepmother
she
recalled
the
day
when
her
mind
excited
by
a
certain
gossip
of
wilson
s
it
was
previously
in
a
state
of
fever
bordering
on
delirium
she
had
prayed
her
husband
in
terror
and
anguish
not
to
marry
barbara
how
could
he
marry
her
he
had
replied
in
his
soothing
pity
she
isabel
was
his
wife
who
was
barbara
nothing
to
them
but
it
had
all
come
to
pass
she
had
brought
it
forth
not
carlyle
not
barbara
she
alone
oh
the
dreadful
misery
of
the
retrospect
lost
in
thought
in
anguish
past
and
present
in
repentance
the
time
passed
on
nearly
an
hour
must
have
elapsed
since
carlyle
s
departure
and
william
had
not
disturbed
her
but
who
was
this
coming
into
the
room
joyce
she
hastily
rose
up
as
joyce
advancing
with
a
quiet
step
drew
aside
the
clothes
to
look
at
william
master
says
he
has
been
wanting
me
she
observed
why
oh
it
was
a
sharp
momentary
cry
subdued
as
soon
as
uttered
madame
vine
sprang
forward
to
joyce
s
side
looking
also
the
pale
young
face
lay
calm
in
its
utter
stillness
the
busy
little
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
jesus
christ
had
indeed
come
and
taken
the
fleeting
spirit
then
she
lost
all
she
believed
that
she
had
reconciled
herself
to
the
child
s
death
that
she
could
part
with
him
without
too
great
emotion
but
she
had
not
anticipated
it
would
be
quite
so
soon
she
had
deemed
that
some
hours
more
would
at
least
be
given
him
and
now
the
storm
overwhelmed
her
crying
sobbing
calling
she
flung
herself
upon
him
she
clasped
him
to
her
she
dashed
off
her
disguising
glasses
she
laid
her
face
upon
his
beseeching
him
to
come
back
to
her
that
she
might
say
farewell
to
her
his
mother
her
darling
child
her
lost
william
joyce
was
terrified
terrified
for
consequences
with
her
full
strength
she
pulled
her
from
the
boy
praying
her
to
consider
to
be
still
do
not
do
not
for
the
love
of
heaven
my
lady
my
lady
it
was
the
old
familiar
title
that
struck
upon
her
fears
and
induced
calmness
she
stared
at
joyce
and
retreated
backward
after
the
manner
of
one
receding
from
some
hideous
vision
then
as
recollection
came
to
her
she
snatched
her
glasses
up
and
hurried
them
on
my
lady
let
me
take
you
into
your
room
carlyle
is
come
he
is
just
bringing
up
his
wife
only
think
if
you
should
give
way
before
him
pray
come
away
how
did
you
know
me
she
asked
in
a
hollow
voice
my
lady
it
was
that
night
when
there
was
an
alarm
of
fire
i
went
close
up
to
you
to
take
master
archibald
from
your
arms
and
as
sure
as
i
am
now
standing
here
i
believe
that
for
the
moment
my
senses
left
me
i
thought
i
saw
a
spectre
the
spectre
of
my
dead
lady
i
forgot
the
present
i
forgot
that
all
were
standing
round
me
that
you
madame
vine
were
alive
before
me
your
face
was
not
disguised
then
the
moonlight
shone
full
upon
it
and
i
knew
it
after
the
first
few
moments
of
terror
to
be
in
dreadful
truth
the
living
one
of
lady
isabel
my
lady
come
away
we
shall
have
carlyle
poor
thing
she
sank
upon
her
knees
in
her
humility
her
dread
oh
joyce
have
pity
upon
me
don
t
betray
me
i
will
leave
the
house
indeed
i
will
don
t
betray
me
while
i
am
in
it
my
lady
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
i
have
kept
the
secret
buried
within
my
breast
since
then
last
april
it
has
nearly
been
too
much
for
me
by
night
and
by
day
i
have
had
no
peace
dreading
what
might
come
out
think
of
the
awful
confusion
the
consequences
should
it
come
to
the
knowledge
of
and
carlyle
indeed
my
lady
you
never
ought
to
have
joyce
she
said
hollowly
lifting
her
haggard
face
i
could
not
keep
away
from
my
unhappy
children
is
it
no
punishment
to
me
think
you
the
being
here
she
added
vehemently
to
see
him
my
husband
the
husband
of
another
it
is
killing
oh
my
lady
come
away
i
hear
him
i
hear
him
partly
coaxing
partly
dragging
her
joyce
took
her
into
her
own
room
and
left
her
there
carlyle
was
at
that
moment
at
the
door
of
the
sick
one
joyce
sprang
forward
her
face
in
her
emotion
and
fear
was
of
one
livid
whiteness
and
she
shook
as
william
had
shaken
poor
child
in
the
afternoon
it
was
only
too
apparent
in
the
corridor
joyce
he
exclaimed
in
amazement
what
ails
you
sir
master
she
panted
be
prepared
master
william
master
joyce
not
dead
alas
yes
sir
carlyle
strode
into
the
chamber
but
ere
he
was
well
across
it
he
turned
back
to
slip
the
bolt
of
the
door
on
the
pillow
lay
the
white
thin
face
at
rest
now
my
boy
my
boy
oh
my
god
he
murmured
in
bowed
reverence
mayest
thou
have
received
this
child
to
rest
in
jesus
even
as
i
trust
thou
hadst
already
received
his
unhappy
mother

xliv
lord
vane
dating
forward
to
the
burial
of
william
carlyle
came
lord
mount
severn
and
his
son
wilson
had
been
right
in
her
surmises
as
to
the
the
carlyle
vault
was
opened
for
him
and
an
order
went
forth
to
the
sculptor
for
an
inscription
to
be
added
to
their
marble
tablet
in
the
church
william
vane
carlyle
eldest
son
of
archibald
carlyle
of

amongst
those
who
attended
the
funeral
as
mourners
went
one
more
notable
in
the
eyes
of
the
gazers
than
the
rest
richard
hare
the
younger
lady
isabel
was
ill
in
mind
and
ominously
ill
in
body
she
kept
her
room
and
joyce
attended
on
her
the
household
set
down
madame
s
illness
to
the
fatigue
of
having
attended
upon
master
william
it
was
not
thought
of
seriously
by
any
one
especially
as
she
declined
to
see
a
doctor
all
her
thoughts
now
were
directed
to
the
getting
away
from
east
lynne
for
it
would
never
do
to
remain
there
to
die
and
she
knew
that
death
was
on
his
way
to
her
and
that
no
human
power
or
skill
not
all
the
faculty
combined
could
turn
him
back
again
the
excessive
dread
of
detection
was
not
upon
her
as
it
had
been
formerly
i
mean
she
did
not
dread
the
consequences
so
much
if
detection
came
in
nearing
the
grave
all
fears
and
hopes
of
whatever
nature
relating
to
this
world
lose
their
force
and
fears
or
hopes
regarding
the
next
world
take
their
place
our
petty
feelings
here
are
lost
in
the
greater
in
returning
to
east
lynne
lady
isabel
had
entered
upon
a
daring
act
and
she
found
in
the
working
that
neither
strength
nor
spirit
was
equal
to
it
human
passions
and
tempers
were
brought
with
us
into
this
world
and
they
can
only
quit
us
when
we
bid
it
farewell
to
enter
upon
immortality
in
the
next
when
lady
isabel
was
carlyle
s
wife
she
had
never
wholly
loved
him
the
very
utmost
homage
that
esteem
admiration
affection
could
give
was
his
but
that
mysterious
passion
called
by
the
name
of
love
and
which
as
i
truly
and
heartily
believe
can
not
in
its
refined
etherealism
be
known
to
many
of
us
had
not
been
given
to
him
it
was
now
from
the
very
night
she
came
back
to
east
lynne
her
love
for
carlyle
had
burst
forth
with
an
intensity
never
before
felt
it
had
been
smoldering
almost
ever
since
she
quitted
him
reprehensible
groans
a
moralist
very
everybody
knows
that
as
afy
would
say
but
her
heart
you
see
had
not
done
with
human
passions
and
they
work
ill
and
contrariness
let
the
word
stand
critic
if
you
please
and
precisely
everything
they
should
not
i
shall
get
in
for
it
i
fear
if
i
attempt
to
defend
her
but
it
was
not
exactly
the
same
thing
as
though
she
suffered
herself
to
fall
in
love
with
somebody
else
s
husband
nobody
would
defend
that
we
have
not
turned
mormons
yet
and
the
world
does
not
walk
upon
its
head
but
this
was
a
peculiar
case
she
poor
thing
almost
regarded
carlyle
as
her
husband
the
bent
of
her
thoughts
was
only
too
much
inclined
to
this
the
evil
human
heart
again
many
and
many
a
time
did
she
wake
up
from
a
reverie
and
strive
to
drive
this
mistaken
view
of
things
away
from
her
taking
shame
to
herself
ten
minutes
afterward
she
would
catch
her
brain
reveling
in
the
same
rebellious
vision
carlyle
s
love
was
not
hers
now
it
was
barbara
s
carlyle
did
not
belong
to
her
he
belonged
to
his
wife
it
was
not
only
that
he
was
not
hers
he
was
another
s
you
may
therefore
if
you
have
the
pleasure
of
being
experienced
in
this
sort
of
thing
guess
a
little
of
what
her
inward
life
was
had
there
been
no
barbara
in
the
case
she
might
have
lived
and
borne
it
as
it
was
it
had
killed
her
before
her
time
that
and
the
remorse
together
there
had
been
other
things
too
the
of
francis
levison
at
west
lynne
in
fresh
contact
as
may
be
said
with
herself
had
struck
terror
to
her
heart
and
the
dark
charge
brought
against
him
augmented
awfully
her
remorse
then
the
sharp
lances
perpetually
thrust
upon
her
memory
the
lady
isabel
s
memory
from
all
sides
were
full
of
cruel
stings
unintentionally
though
they
were
hurled
and
there
was
the
hourly
chance
of
discovery
and
the
never
ceasing
battle
with
her
conscience
for
being
at
east
lynne
at
all
no
wonder
that
the
chords
of
life
were
snapping
the
wonder
would
have
been
had
they
remained
whole
she
brought
it
upon
herself
she
ought
not
to
have
come
back
to
east
lynne
groans
our
moralist
again
didn
t
i
say
so
of
course
she
ought
not
neither
ought
she
to
have
suffered
her
thoughts
to
stray
in
the
manner
they
did
towards
carlyle
she
ought
not
but
she
did
if
we
all
did
just
what
we
ought
this
lower
proverb
touching
fruit
defendu
would
go
out
as
a
dead
letter
she
was
nearer
to
death
than
she
imagined
she
knew
judging
by
her
declining
strength
and
her
inner
feelings
that
it
could
not
be
far
off
but
she
did
not
deem
it
was
coming
so
very
soon
her
mother
had
died
in
a
similar
way
some
said
of
consumption
martin
did
you
may
remember
some
said
of
waste
the
earl
her
husband
said
a
broken
heart
you
heard
him
say
so
to
carlyle
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
history
the
earl
was
the
one
who
might
be
supposed
to
know
best
whatever
may
have
been
lady
mount
severn
s
malady
she
to
give
you
the
phrase
that
was
in
people
s
mouth
s
at
the
time
went
out
like
the
snuff
of
a
it
was
now
the
turn
of
lady
isabel
she
had
no
more
decided
disorder
than
the
countess
had
had
yet
death
had
marked
her
she
felt
that
it
had
and
in
its
approach
she
dreaded
not
as
she
once
had
done
the
consequences
that
must
ensue
did
discovery
come
which
brings
us
back
to
the
point
whence
ensued
this
long
digression
i
dare
say
you
are
chafing
at
it
but
it
is
not
often
i
trouble
you
with
one
but
she
would
not
willingly
let
discovery
come
neither
had
she
the
least
intention
of
remaining
at
east
lynne
to
die
where
she
should
take
refuge
was
quite
a
secondary
consideration
only
let
her
get
smoothly
and
plausibly
away
joyce
in
her
dread
was
forever
urging
it
of
course
the
preliminary
step
was
to
arrange
matters
with
carlyle
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
following
the
funeral
lady
isabel
proceeded
to
her
and
craved
an
interview
carlyle
quitted
the
room
as
she
entered
it
barbara
fatigued
with
a
recent
drive
was
lying
on
the
sofa
she
would
scarcely
take
the
notice
we
shall
be
so
sorry
to
lose
you
madame
vine
you
are
all
we
could
wish
for
lucy
and
carlyle
feels
truly
grateful
for
your
love
and
attention
to
his
poor
to
leave
you
will
give
me
pain
also
madame
vine
answered
in
a
subdued
tone
pain
ay
carlyle
little
guessed
at
its
extent
all
she
cared
for
on
earth
she
should
leave
behind
her
at
east
lynne
indeed
you
must
not
leave
resumed
barbara
it
would
be
unjust
to
allow
you
to
do
so
you
have
made
yourself
ill
waiting
upon
poor
william
and
you
must
stay
here
and
take
a
holiday
until
you
are
cured
you
will
soon
get
well
if
you
will
only
suffer
yourself
to
be
properly
waited
on
and
taken
care
you
are
very
considerate
pray
do
not
think
me
insensible
if
i
decline
i
believe
my
strength
is
beyond
getting
up
that
i
shall
never
be
able
to
teach
oh
nonsense
said
barbara
in
her
quick
way
we
are
all
given
to
fancy
the
worst
when
we
are
ill
i
was
feeling
terribly
weak
only
a
few
minutes
ago
and
said
something
of
the
same
sort
to
archibald
he
talked
and
soothed
me
out
of
it
i
wish
you
had
your
dear
husband
living
madame
vine
to
support
you
and
love
you
as
i
have
a
tinge
of
scarlet
streaked
madame
vine
s
pale
face
and
she
laid
her
hand
upon
her
beating
heart
how
could
you
think
of
leaving
we
should
be
glad
to
help
your
health
in
any
case
but
it
is
only
fair
to
do
it
now
i
felt
sure
by
the
news
brought
to
me
when
i
was
ill
that
your
attention
upon
william
was
overtasking
your
it
is
not
the
attendance
upon
william
that
has
brought
me
into
this
state
was
the
quick
answer
i
must
leave
i
have
well
considered
it
would
you
like
to
go
to
the
seaside
exclaimed
barbara
with
sudden
energy
i
am
going
there
on
monday
next
carlyle
insists
upon
it
that
i
try
a
little
change
i
had
intended
only
to
take
my
baby
but
we
can
make
different
arrangements
and
take
you
and
lucy
it
might
do
you
good
madame
she
shook
her
head
no
it
would
make
me
worse
all
that
i
want
is
perfect
quiet
i
must
beg
you
to
understand
that
i
shall
leave
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
allow
the
customary
notice
to
be
dispensed
with
so
that
i
may
be
at
liberty
to
depart
within
a
few
look
here
then
said
barbara
after
a
pause
of
consideration
you
remain
at
east
lynne
until
my
return
which
will
be
in
a
fortnight
carlyle
can
not
stay
with
me
so
i
know
i
shall
be
tired
in
less
time
than
that
i
do
not
want
you
to
remain
to
teach
you
know
madame
vine
i
do
not
wish
you
to
do
a
single
thing
lucy
shall
have
a
holiday
and
kane
can
come
up
for
her
music
only
i
could
not
be
content
to
leave
her
unless
under
your
surveillance
she
is
getting
of
an
age
now
not
to
be
consigned
to
servants
not
to
joyce
upon
my
return
if
you
still
wish
to
leave
you
shall
then
be
at
liberty
to
do
so
what
do
you
say
madame
vine
said
said
it
eagerly
to
have
another
fortnight
with
her
children
lucy
and
archibald
was
very
like
a
reprieve
and
she
embraced
it
although
she
knew
as
i
have
said
that
grim
death
was
on
his
way
she
did
not
think
he
had
drawn
so
near
the
end
of
his
journey
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
when
she
had
been
ordered
to
the
seaside
after
an
illness
it
had
been
a
marvel
if
they
had
not
she
remembered
how
he
her
husband
had
urged
the
change
upon
her
how
he
had
taken
her
traveling
carefully
how
tenderly
anxious
he
had
been
in
the
arrangements
for
her
comfort
when
settling
her
in
the
lodgings
how
when
he
came
again
to
see
her
he
had
met
her
with
his
passionate
fondness
thanking
god
for
the
visible
improvement
in
her
looks
that
one
injunction
which
she
had
called
him
back
to
give
him
as
he
was
departing
for
the
boat
was
bitterly
present
to
her
now
do
not
get
making
love
to
barbara
all
this
care
and
love
and
tenderness
belonged
now
of
right
to
barbara
and
were
given
to
her
but
now
barbara
although
she
pressed
madame
vine
to
remain
at
east
lynne
and
indeed
would
have
been
glad
that
she
should
do
so
did
not
take
her
refusal
at
heart
barbara
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
she
was
a
thoroughly
refined
gentlewoman
far
superior
to
the
generality
of
governesses
that
she
was
truly
fond
of
lucy
and
most
anxious
for
her
welfare
in
every
way
barbara
also
saw
for
lucy
s
sake
therefore
she
would
be
grieved
to
part
with
madame
vine
and
would
raise
her
salary
to
anything
in
reason
if
she
would
but
stay
but
on
her
own
score
barbara
had
as
soon
madame
vine
went
as
not
for
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
had
never
liked
her
she
could
not
have
told
why
was
it
instinct
very
probably
the
birds
of
the
air
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
fishes
of
the
sea
have
their
instincts
and
so
does
man
have
his
perhaps
it
was
the
unaccountable
resemblance
that
madame
vine
bore
to
lady
isabel
a
strange
likeness
barbara
often
thought
but
whether
it
lay
in
the
face
the
voice
or
the
manner
she
could
not
decide
a
suspicion
of
the
truth
did
not
cross
her
mind
how
should
it
and
she
never
spoke
of
it
had
the
resemblance
been
to
any
one
but
lady
isabel
she
would
have
talked
of
it
freely
or
it
may
have
been
that
there
was
now
and
then
a
tone
in
madame
vine
s
voice
that
grated
on
her
ear
a
wrung
impatient
tone
wanting
in
respect
savoring
of
hauteur
which
barbara
did
not
understand
and
did
not
like
however
it
may
have
been
certain
it
is
that
carlyle
would
not
shed
tears
after
the
governess
only
for
lucy
s
sake
did
she
regret
parting
with
her
these
different
resemblances
and
reflections
were
separately
passing
through
the
minds
of
the
two
ladies
when
their
conference
was
over
madame
vine
at
length
rose
from
her
chair
to
depart
would
you
mind
holding
my
baby
for
one
minute
cried
barbara
madame
vine
quite
started
the
baby
there
she
uttered
barbara
laughed
it
is
lying
by
my
side
under
the
shawl
quiet
little
sleeping
madame
vine
advanced
and
took
the
sleeping
baby
how
could
she
refuse
she
had
never
had
it
in
her
arms
before
she
had
in
fact
scarcely
seen
it
one
visit
of
ceremony
she
had
paid
carlyle
as
in
politeness
bound
a
day
or
two
after
the
young
lady
s
arrival
and
had
been
shown
a
little
face
nearly
covered
with
lace
in
a
cradle
thank
you
i
can
get
up
now
i
might
have
half
smothered
it
had
i
attempted
before
continued
barbara
still
laughing
i
have
been
here
long
enough
and
am
quite
rested
talking
about
smothering
children
what
accounts
have
we
in
the
s
weekly
returns
of
health
so
many
children
overlaid
in
bed
so
many
children
suffocated
in
one
week
there
were
nearly
twenty
and
often
there
are
as
many
as
eight
or
ten
carlyle
says
he
knows
they
are
smothered
on
oh
carlyle
i
exclaimed
just
as
you
do
when
he
said
it
and
laid
my
hand
over
his
lips
he
laughed
and
told
me
i
did
not
know
half
the
wickedness
of
the
world
thank
you
again
repeated
carlyle
taking
her
child
from
lady
isabel
is
she
not
a
pretty
baby
do
you
like
the
name
anne
it
is
a
simple
name
replied
lady
isabel
and
simple
names
are
always
the
most
that
is
just
what
archibald
thinks
but
he
wanted
this
child
s
to
be
barbara
i
would
not
have
had
it
barbara
for
the
world
i
remember
his
once
saying
a
long
long
while
ago
that
he
did
not
like
elaborate
names
they
were
mouthfuls
and
he
instanced
mine
and
his
sister
s
and
his
own
i
recalled
his
words
to
him
and
he
said
he
may
not
have
liked
the
name
of
barbara
then
but
he
loved
it
now
so
we
entered
into
a
compromise
miss
baby
was
named
anne
barbara
with
an
understanding
that
the
first
name
is
to
be
for
use
and
the
last
for
the
it
is
not
christened
said
lady
isabel
only
baptized
we
should
have
had
it
christened
before
now
but
for
william
s
death
not
that
we
give
christening
dinners
but
i
waited
for
the
trial
at
lynneborough
to
be
over
that
my
dear
brother
richard
might
stand
to
the
mr
carlyle
does
not
like
christenings
made
into
festivals
lady
isabel
dreamily
observed
her
thoughts
buried
in
the
past
how
do
you
know
that
exclaimed
barbara
opening
her
eyes
and
poor
madame
vine
her
pale
face
flushing
had
to
stammer
forth
some
confused
words
that
she
had
heard
so
it
is
quite
true
said
barbara
he
has
never
given
a
dinner
for
any
of
his
children
and
gets
out
of
attending
if
invited
to
one
he
can
not
understand
the
analogy
between
a
solemn
religious
rite
and
the
meeting
together
afterward
to
eat
and
drink
and
make
merry
according
to
the
fashion
of
this
as
lady
isabel
quitted
the
room
young
vane
was
careering
through
the
corridor
throwing
his
head
in
all
directions
and
calling
out
lucy
i
want
lucy
what
do
you
want
with
her
asked
madame
vine
il
m
est
impossible
de
vous
le
dire
madame
responded
he
being
for
an
eton
boy
wonderfully
up
in
french
he
was
rather
given
to
show
it
off
when
he
got
the
chance
he
did
not
owe
thanks
for
it
to
eton
lady
mount
severn
had
taken
better
care
than
that
better
care
what
could
she
want
there
was
one
whole
real
live
french
tutor
and
he
an
englishman
for
the
eight
hundred
boys
very
unreasonable
of
her
ladyship
to
disparage
that
ample
provision
lucy
can
not
come
to
you
just
now
she
is
mais
il
le
faut
j
ai
le
droit
de
demander
apres
elle
elle
m
appartient
vous
comprenez
madame
cette
demoiselle
madame
could
not
forbear
a
smile
i
wish
you
would
speak
english
sense
instead
of
french
then
the
english
sense
is
that
i
want
lucy
and
i
must
have
her
i
am
going
to
take
her
for
a
drive
in
the
pony
carriage
if
you
must
know
she
said
she
d
come
and
john
s
getting
it
i
could
not
possibly
allow
it
said
madame
vine
you
d
be
sure
to
upset
the
idea
he
returned
indignantly
as
if
i
should
upset
lucy
why
i
m
one
of
the
great
whips
at
eton
i
care
for
lucy
too
much
not
to
drive
steadily
she
is
to
be
my
wife
you
know
ma
bonne
at
this
juncture
two
heads
were
pushed
out
from
the
library
close
by
those
of
the
earl
and
carlyle
barbara
also
attracted
by
the
talking
appeared
at
the
door
of
her
what
s
that
about
a
wife
asked
my
lord
of
his
son
the
blood
mantled
in
the
young
gentleman
s
cheek
as
he
turned
round
and
saw
who
had
spoken
but
he
possessed
all
the
fearlessness
of
an
eton
boy
i
intend
lucy
carlyle
to
be
my
wife
papa
i
mean
in
earnest
when
we
shall
both
be
grown
up
if
you
will
approve
and
carlyle
will
give
her
to
the
earl
looked
somewhat
impassable
carlyle
amused
suppose
said
the
latter
we
adjourn
the
discussion
to
this
day
ten
years
but
that
lucy
is
so
very
young
a
child
i
should
reprove
you
seriously
sir
said
the
earl
you
have
no
right
to
bring
lucy
s
name
into
any
such
i
mean
it
papa
you
ll
all
see
and
i
intend
to
keep
out
of
scrapes
that
is
of
nasty
dishonorable
scrapes
on
purpose
that
carlyle
shall
find
no
excuse
against
me
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
be
what
he
is
a
man
of
honor
i
am
right
glad
you
know
about
it
sir
and
i
shall
let
mamma
know
it
before
the
last
sentence
tickled
the
earl
s
fancy
and
a
grim
smile
passed
over
his
lips
it
will
be
war
to
the
knife
if
you
i
know
that
laughed
the
viscount
but
i
am
getting
a
better
match
for
mamma
in
our
battles
than
i
used
to
nobody
saw
fit
to
prolong
the
discussion
barbara
put
her
veto
upon
the
drive
in
the
pony
carriage
unless
john
sat
behind
to
look
after
the
driver
which
lord
vane
still
resented
as
an
insult
madame
vine
when
the
corridor
became
empty
again
laid
her
hand
upon
the
boy
s
arm
as
he
was
moving
away
and
drew
him
to
the
window
in
speaking
as
you
do
of
lucy
carlyle
do
you
forget
the
disgrace
reflected
on
her
by
the
conduct
of
her
mother
her
mother
is
not
it
may
prove
an
impediment
that
with
lord
and
lady
mount
not
with
his
lordship
and
i
must
do
as
you
heard
me
say
battle
with
my
mother
conciliatory
battle
you
understand
madame
bringing
the
enemy
to
madame
vine
was
agitated
she
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
and
the
boy
noticed
how
her
hands
trembled
i
have
learnt
to
love
lucy
it
has
appeared
to
me
in
these
few
months
sojourn
with
her
that
i
have
stood
to
her
in
light
of
a
mother
william
vane
she
solemnly
added
keeping
her
hold
upon
him
i
shall
soon
be
where
earthly
distinctions
are
no
more
where
sin
and
sorrow
are
no
more
should
lucy
carlyle
indeed
become
your
wife
in
after
years
never
never
cast
upon
her
by
so
much
as
the
slightest
word
of
reproach
the
sin
of
lady
lord
vane
threw
back
his
head
his
honest
eyes
flashing
in
their
indignant
earnestness
what
do
you
take
me
for
it
would
be
a
cruel
wrong
upon
lucy
she
does
not
deserve
it
that
unhappy
lady
s
sin
was
all
her
own
let
it
die
with
her
never
speak
to
lucy
of
her
the
lad
dashed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
for
they
were
filling
i
shall
i
shall
speak
to
her
often
of
her
mother
that
is
you
know
after
she
s
my
wife
i
shall
tell
her
how
i
loved
lady
isabel
that
there
s
nobody
i
ever
loved
so
much
in
the
world
but
lucy
herself
i
cast
a
reproach
to
lucy
on
the
score
of
her
mother
he
hotly
added
it
is
through
her
mother
that
i
love
her
you
don
t
understand
cherish
and
love
her
forever
should
she
become
yours
said
lady
isabel
wringing
his
hand
i
ask
it
you
as
one
who
is
i
will
i
promise
it
but
i
say
madame
he
continued
dropping
his
fervent
tone
what
do
you
allude
to
are
you
worse
madame
vine
did
not
answer
she
glided
away
without
speaking
later
when
she
was
sitting
by
twilight
in
the
gray
parlor
cold
and
shivering
and
wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
though
it
was
hot
summer
weather
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
cried
she
apathetically
it
was
carlyle
who
entered
she
rose
up
her
pulses
quickening
her
heart
thumping
against
her
side
in
her
wild
confusion
she
was
drawing
forward
a
chair
for
him
he
laid
his
hand
upon
it
and
motioned
her
to
her
own
mrs
carlyle
tells
me
that
you
have
been
speaking
to
her
of
leaving
that
you
find
yourself
too
much
out
of
health
to
continue
with
yes
sir
she
faintly
replied
having
a
most
imperfect
notion
of
what
she
did
say
what
is
it
that
you
find
to
be
the
matter
with
you
i
think
it
is
chiefly
weakness
she
stammered
her
face
had
grown
as
gray
as
the
walls
a
dusky
livid
sort
of
hue
not
unlike
william
s
had
worn
the
night
of
his
death
and
her
voice
sounded
strangely
hollow
it
the
voice
struck
carlyle
and
awoke
his
fears
you
can
not
you
never
can
have
caught
william
s
complaint
in
your
close
attendance
upon
him
he
exclaimed
speaking
in
the
impulse
of
the
moment
as
the
idea
flashed
across
him
i
have
heard
of
such
caught
it
from
him
she
rejoined
carried
away
also
by
impulse
it
is
more
likely
that
he
she
stopped
herself
just
in
time
inherited
it
from
me
had
been
the
destined
conclusion
in
her
alarm
she
went
off
volubly
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
no
wonder
she
was
ill
illness
was
natural
to
her
at
any
rate
you
have
become
ill
at
east
lynne
in
attendance
on
my
children
rejoined
carlyle
decisively
when
her
voice
died
away
you
must
therefore
allow
me
to
insist
that
you
allow
east
lynne
to
do
what
it
can
toward
renovating
you
what
is
your
objection
to
see
a
doctor
a
doctor
could
do
me
no
good
she
faintly
answered
certainly
not
so
long
as
you
will
not
consult
indeed
sir
doctors
could
not
cure
me
nor
as
i
believe
prolong
my
carlyle
paused
are
you
believing
yourself
to
be
in
danger
not
in
immediate
danger
sir
only
in
so
far
as
that
i
know
i
shall
not
and
yet
you
will
not
see
a
doctor
madame
vine
you
must
be
aware
that
i
could
not
permit
such
a
thing
to
go
on
in
my
house
dangerous
illness
and
no
advice
she
could
not
say
to
him
my
malady
is
on
the
mind
it
is
a
breaking
heart
and
therefore
no
doctor
of
physic
could
serve
that
would
never
do
she
had
sat
with
her
hand
across
her
face
between
her
spectacles
and
her
chin
had
carlyle
possessed
the
eyes
of
argus
backed
by
sam
weller
s
patent
magnifying
microscopes
of
double
hextra
power
he
could
not
have
made
anything
of
her
features
in
the
broad
light
of
day
but
she
did
not
feel
so
sure
of
it
there
was
always
an
undefined
terror
of
discovery
when
in
his
presence
and
she
wished
the
interview
at
an
end
i
will
see
wainwright
if
it
will
be
any
satisfaction
to
you
madame
vine
i
have
intruded
upon
you
here
to
say
that
you
must
see
him
and
should
he
deem
it
necessary
martin
oh
sir
she
rejoined
with
a
curious
smile
mr
wainwright
will
be
quite
sufficient
there
will
be
no
need
of
another
i
will
write
a
note
to
him
spare
yourself
the
trouble
i
am
going
into
west
lynne
and
will
send
him
up
you
will
permit
me
to
urge
that
you
spare
no
pains
or
care
that
you
suffer
my
servants
to
spare
no
pains
or
care
to
your
health
carlyle
tells
me
that
the
question
of
your
leaving
remains
in
abeyance
until
her
pardon
me
sir
the
understanding
with
carlyle
was
that
i
should
remain
here
until
her
return
and
should
then
be
at
liberty
at
once
to
exactly
that
is
what
carlyle
said
but
i
must
express
a
hope
that
by
that
time
you
may
be
feeling
so
much
better
as
to
reconsider
your
decision
and
continue
with
us
for
my
daughter
s
sake
madame
vine
i
trust
it
will
be
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
held
out
his
hand
what
could
she
do
but
rise
also
drop
hers
from
her
face
and
give
it
him
in
answer
he
retained
it
clasping
it
warmly
how
should
i
repay
you
how
thank
you
for
your
love
to
my
poor
lost
boy
his
earnest
tender
eyes
were
on
her
blue
double
spectacles
a
sad
smile
mingled
with
the
sweet
expression
of
his
lips
as
he
bent
toward
her
lips
that
had
once
been
hers
a
faint
exclamation
of
despair
a
vivid
glow
of
hot
crimson
and
she
caught
up
her
new
black
silk
apron
so
deeply
bordered
with
crape
in
her
disengaged
hand
and
flung
it
up
to
her
face
he
mistook
the
sound
mistook
the
action
do
not
grieve
for
him
he
is
at
rest
thank
you
thank
you
greatly
for
your
another
wring
of
her
hand
and
carlyle
had
quitted
the
room
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
table
and
thought
how
merciful
would
be
death
when
he
should
come
chapter
xlv
it
won
t
do
afy
jiffin
was
in
his
glory
jiffin
s
house
was
the
same
both
were
in
order
to
receive
miss
afy
hallijohn
who
was
in
a
very
short
period
indeed
to
be
converted
into
jiffin
jiffin
had
not
seen
afy
for
some
days
had
never
been
able
to
come
across
her
since
the
trial
at
lynneborough
every
evening
had
he
danced
attendance
at
her
lodgings
but
could
not
get
admitted
not
at
home
not
at
home
was
the
invariable
answer
though
afy
might
be
sunning
herself
at
the
window
in
his
very
sight
jiffin
throwing
off
as
best
he
could
the
temporary
disappointment
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
admiration
for
he
set
it
all
down
to
afy
s
retiring
modesty
on
the
approach
of
the
nuptial
day
and
they
could
try
to
calumniate
her
he
indignantly
replied
but
now
one
afternoon
when
jiffin
and
his
shopman
and
his
shop
and
his
wares
were
all
set
out
to
the
best
advantage
and
very
tempting
they
looked
as
a
whole
especially
the
spiced
bacon
jiffin
happening
to
cast
his
eyes
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
beheld
his
beloved
sailing
by
she
was
got
up
in
the
fashion
a
mauve
silk
dress
with
eighteen
flounces
and
about
eighteen
hundred
steel
buttons
that
glittered
your
sight
away
a
zouave
jacket
worked
with
gold
a
black
turban
perched
on
the
top
of
her
skull
garnished
in
front
with
what
court
milliners
are
pleased
to
term
a
plume
de
coq
but
which
by
its
size
and
height
might
have
been
taken
for
a
coq
himself
while
a
white
ostrich
feather
was
carried
round
and
did
duty
behind
and
a
spangled
hair
net
hung
down
to
her
waist
gloriously
grand
was
afy
that
day
and
if
i
had
but
a
photographing
machine
at
hand
or
whatever
may
be
the
scientific
name
of
the
thing
you
should
certainly
have
been
regaled
with
the
sight
of
her
joyce
would
have
gone
down
in
a
fit
had
she
encountered
her
by
an
unhappy
chance
jiffin
dashing
his
apron
anywhere
tore
across
oh
it
is
you
said
afy
freezingly
when
compelled
to
acknowledge
him
but
his
offered
hand
she
utterly
repudiated
really
jiffin
i
should
feel
obliged
if
you
would
not
come
out
to
me
in
this
offensive
and
public
jiffin
grew
cold
offensive
not
come
out
gasped
he
i
do
trust
i
have
not
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
offend
you
miss
afy
well
you
see
said
afy
calling
up
all
her
impudence
to
say
what
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
say
i
have
been
considering
it
well
over
jiffin
and
i
find
that
to
carry
out
the
marriage
will
not
be
for
my
for
our
happiness
i
intended
to
write
to
inform
you
of
this
but
i
shall
be
spared
the
trouble
as
you
have
come
out
to
the
perspiration
cold
as
ice
began
to
pour
off
jiffin
in
his
agony
and
horror
you
might
have
wrung
every
thread
he
had
on
you
don
t
mean
to
imply
that
you
give
me
up
miss
afy
he
jerked
out
unevenly
well
yes
i
do
replied
afy
it
s
as
good
to
be
plain
and
then
there
can
be
no
misapprehension
i
ll
shake
hands
now
with
you
jiffin
for
the
last
time
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
we
both
made
such
a
poor
jiffin
looked
at
her
his
gaze
would
have
melted
a
heart
of
stone
miss
afy
you
can
t
mean
it
you
d
never
sure
crush
a
fellow
in
this
manner
whose
whole
soul
is
yours
who
trusted
you
entirely
there
s
not
an
earthly
thing
i
would
not
do
to
please
you
you
have
been
the
light
of
my
of
course
returned
afy
with
a
lofty
and
indifferent
air
as
if
to
be
the
light
of
his
existence
was
only
her
due
but
it
s
all
done
and
over
it
is
not
at
all
a
settlement
that
will
suit
me
you
see
jiffin
a
butter
and
bacon
factor
is
so
very
so
very
what
i
have
not
been
accustomed
to
and
then
those
aprons
i
never
could
get
reconciled
to
i
ll
discard
the
aprons
altogether
cried
he
in
a
fever
i
ll
get
a
second
shopman
and
buy
a
little
gig
and
do
nothing
but
drive
you
out
i
ll
do
anything
if
you
will
but
have
me
still
miss
afy
i
have
bought
the
ring
you
your
intentions
are
very
kind
was
the
distant
answer
but
it
s
a
thing
impossible
my
mind
is
fully
made
up
so
farewell
for
good
jiffin
and
i
wish
you
better
luck
in
your
next
afy
lifting
her
capacious
dress
for
the
streets
had
just
been
watered
minced
off
and
joe
jiffin
wiping
his
wet
face
as
he
gazed
after
her
instantly
wished
that
he
could
be
nailed
up
in
one
of
his
pickled
pork
barrels
and
so
be
out
of
his
misery
that
s
done
with
thank
goodness
soliloquized
afy
have
him
indeed
after
what
richard
let
out
on
the
trial
as
if
i
should
look
after
anybody
less
than
dick
hare
i
shall
get
him
too
i
always
knew
dick
hare
loved
me
above
everything
on
earth
and
he
does
still
or
he
d
never
had
said
what
he
did
in
open
court
it
s
better
to
be
born
lucky
than
won
t
west
lynne
envy
me
richard
hare
of
the
grove
old
hare
is
on
his
last
legs
and
then
dick
comes
into
his
own
hare
must
have
her
jointure
house
elsewhere
for
we
shall
want
the
grove
for
ourselves
i
wonder
if
madame
barbara
will
condescend
to
recognize
me
and
that
blessed
corny
i
shall
be
a
sort
of
cousin
of
corny
s
then
i
wonder
how
much
dick
comes
into
three
or
four
thousand
a
year
and
to
think
that
i
had
nearly
escaped
this
by
tying
myself
to
that
ape
of
a
jiffin
what
sharks
do
get
in
our
unsuspecting
paths
in
this
world
on
went
afy
through
west
lynne
till
she
arrived
close
to
justice
hare
s
then
she
paced
slowly
it
had
been
a
frequent
walk
of
hers
since
the
trial
luck
favored
her
as
she
was
passing
the
gate
young
richard
hare
came
up
from
the
direction
of
east
lynne
it
was
the
first
time
afy
had
obtained
speech
of
him
good
day
richard
why
you
were
never
going
to
pass
an
old
friend
i
have
so
many
friends
said
richard
i
can
scarcely
spare
time
for
them
but
you
might
for
me
have
you
forgotten
old
days
continued
she
bridling
and
flirting
and
altogether
showing
herself
off
to
advantage
no
i
have
not
replied
richard
and
i
am
not
likely
to
do
so
he
pointedly
added
ah
i
felt
sure
of
that
my
heart
told
me
so
when
you
went
off
that
dreadful
night
leaving
me
to
anguish
and
suspense
i
thought
i
should
have
died
i
never
have
had
so
to
say
a
happy
moment
until
this
when
i
meet
you
don
t
be
a
fool
afy
was
richard
s
gallant
rejoinder
borrowing
the
favorite
reproach
of
miss
carlyle
i
was
young
and
green
once
you
don
t
suppose
i
have
remained
so
we
will
drop
the
past
if
you
please
how
is
jiffin
oh
the
wretch
shrieked
afy
is
it
possible
that
you
can
have
fallen
into
the
popular
scandal
that
i
have
anything
to
say
to
him
you
know
i
d
never
demean
myself
to
it
that
s
west
lynne
all
over
nothing
but
inventions
in
it
from
week
s
end
to
week
s
end
a
man
who
sells
cheese
who
cuts
up
bacon
well
i
am
surprised
at
you
richard
i
have
been
thinking
what
luck
you
were
in
to
get
him
said
richard
with
composure
but
it
is
your
business
not
could
you
bear
to
see
me
stooping
to
him
returned
afy
dropping
her
voice
to
the
most
insinuating
whisper
look
you
afy
what
ridiculous
folly
you
are
nursing
in
your
head
i
don
t
trouble
myself
to
guess
but
the
sooner
you
get
it
out
again
the
better
i
was
an
idiot
once
i
don
t
deny
it
but
you
cured
me
of
that
and
cured
me
with
a
vengeance
you
must
pardon
me
for
intimating
that
from
henceforth
we
are
strangers
in
the
street
as
elsewhere
i
have
resumed
my
own
standing
again
which
i
periled
when
i
ran
after
afy
turned
faint
how
can
you
speak
those
cruel
words
gasped
she
you
have
called
them
forth
i
was
told
yesterday
that
afy
hallijohn
dressed
up
to
a
caricature
was
looking
after
me
again
it
won
t
do
sobbed
afy
growing
hysterical
and
is
this
to
be
all
my
recompense
for
the
years
i
have
spent
pining
after
you
keeping
single
for
your
sake
recompense
oh
if
you
want
that
i
ll
get
my
mother
to
give
jiffin
her
and
with
a
ringing
laugh
which
though
it
had
nothing
of
malice
in
it
showed
afy
that
he
took
her
reproach
for
what
it
was
worth
richard
turned
in
at
his
own
gate
it
was
a
deathblow
to
afy
s
vanity
the
worst
it
had
ever
received
and
she
took
a
few
minutes
to
compose
herself
and
smooth
her
ruffled
feathers
then
she
turned
and
sailed
back
toward
jiffin
s
her
turban
up
in
the
skies
and
the
plume
de
coq
tossing
to
the
admiration
of
all
beholders
especially
of
miss
carlyle
who
had
the
gratification
of
surveying
her
from
her
window
arrived
at
jiffin
s
she
was
taken
ill
exactly
opposite
his
door
and
staggered
into
the
shop
in
a
most
exhausted
state
round
the
counter
flew
jiffin
leaving
the
shopman
staring
behind
it
what
was
the
matter
what
could
he
do
for
her
faint
heat
of
the
sun
walked
too
fast
allowed
to
sit
down
for
five
minutes
gasped
afy
in
disjointed
sentences
jiffin
tenderly
conducted
her
through
the
shop
to
his
parlor
afy
cast
half
an
eye
round
saw
how
comfortable
were
its
arrangements
and
her
symptoms
of
faintness
increased
gasps
and
hysterical
sobs
came
forth
together
jiffin
was
as
one
upon
spikes
she
d
recover
better
there
than
in
the
public
shop
if
she
d
only
excuse
his
bringing
her
in
and
consent
to
stop
for
a
few
minutes
no
harm
could
come
to
her
and
west
lynne
could
never
say
it
he
d
stand
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
right
away
from
her
he
d
prop
open
the
two
doors
and
the
windows
he
d
call
in
the
maid
anything
she
thought
right
should
he
get
her
a
glass
of
wine
afy
declined
the
wine
by
a
gesture
and
sat
fanning
herself
jiffin
looking
on
from
a
respectful
distance
gradually
she
grew
composed
grew
herself
again
as
she
gained
courage
jiffin
lost
it
and
he
ventured
upon
some
faint
words
of
reproach
of
him
afy
burst
into
a
laugh
did
i
not
do
it
well
she
exclaimed
i
thought
i
d
play
off
a
joke
upon
you
so
i
came
out
this
afternoon
and
did
jiffin
clasped
his
hands
was
it
a
joke
he
returned
trembling
with
agitation
uncertain
whether
he
was
in
paradise
or
not
are
you
still
ready
to
let
me
call
you
mine
of
course
it
was
a
joke
said
afy
what
a
soft
you
must
have
been
jiffin
not
to
see
through
it
when
young
ladies
engage
themselves
to
be
married
you
can
t
suppose
they
run
back
from
it
close
upon
the
oh
miss
afy
and
the
poor
little
man
actually
burst
into
delicious
tears
as
he
caught
hold
of
afy
s
hand
and
kissed
it
a
great
green
donkey
thought
afy
to
herself
bending
on
him
however
the
sweetest
smile
rather
but
jiffin
is
not
the
only
great
donkey
in
the
world
richard
hare
meanwhile
had
entered
his
mother
s
presence
she
was
sitting
at
the
open
window
the
justice
opposite
to
her
in
an
invalid
chair
basking
in
the
air
and
the
sun
this
last
attack
of
the
justice
s
had
affected
the
mind
more
than
the
body
he
was
brought
down
to
the
that
day
for
the
first
time
but
of
his
mind
there
was
little
hope
it
was
in
a
state
of
half
imbecility
the
most
wonderful
characteristic
being
that
all
its
its
surliness
had
gone
almost
as
a
little
child
in
tractability
was
justice
hare
richard
came
up
to
his
mother
and
kissed
her
he
had
been
to
east
lynne
hare
took
his
hand
and
fondly
held
it
the
change
in
her
was
wonderful
she
was
a
young
and
happy
woman
again
barbara
has
decided
to
go

seaside

richard

but
still
retaining
her
son
s
hand
barbara
has
agreed
to
go

the

her
up
seaside
can
t
we

certainly
dear
if
you
wish
it
when
you
shall
be
a
little
ay
ay
nodded
the
justice
again
it
was
his
usual
answer
now
stronger
where
s
barbara
she
goes
on
monday
sir
said
richard
likewise
bending
his
head
only
for
a
fortnight
but
they
talk
of
going
again
later
in
the
can
t
i
go
too
repeated
the
justice
looking
pleadingly
in
richard
s
face
you
shall
dear
father
who
knows
but
a
month
or
two
s
bracing
would
bring
you
quite
round
again

go
all
together
ourselves
and
the
carlyles
anne

and
we
might
go
when
her

dear
richard
she

month

children
i
am
so
pleased

added
hare
her
gentle
eyes
filling
mr
wainwright
says
you
may
go
out
for
a
drive
and
i
ll
be
coachman
laughed
richard
it
will
be
the
old
times
come
round
again
do
you
remember
father
my
breaking
the
pole
one
moonlight
night
and
your
not
letting
me
drive
for
six
months
afterwards
the
poor
justice
laughed
in
answer
to
richard
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
probably
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
he
was
laughing
at
richard
said
hare
to
her
son
almost
in
an
apprehensive
tone
her
hand
pressing
his
nervously
was
not
that
afy
hallijohn
i
saw
you
speaking
with
at
the
gate
did
you
what
a
spectacle
she
had
made
of
herself
i
wonder
she
is
not
ashamed
to
go
through
the
streets
in
such
a
guise
indeed
i
wonder
she
shows
herself
at
richard
you
you
will
not
be
drawn
in
again
were
the
next
whispered
words
mother
there
was
a
sternness
in
his
mild
blue
eyes
as
he
cast
them
upon
his
mother
those
beautiful
eyes
the
very
counterpart
of
barbara
s
both
his
and
hers
the
counterpart
of
hare
s
the
look
had
been
sufficient
refutation
without
words
mother
mine
i
am
going
to
belong
to
you
in
the
future
and
to
nobody
else
west
lynne
is
already
busy
for
me
i
understand
pleasantly
carving
out
my
destiny
one
marvels
whether
i
shall
lose
myself
with
miss
afy
another
that
i
shall
set
on
offhand

court
louisa
dobede
they
are
all
wrong
my
place
will
be
with
my
darling
mother
at
least
for
several
years
to
she
clasped
his
hand
to
her
bosom
in
her
glad
delight
we
want
happiness
together
mother
to
enable
us
to
forget
the
past
for
upon
none
did
the
blow
fall
as
upon
you
and
upon
me
and
the
happiness
we
shall
find
in
our
own
home
living
for
each
other
and
striving
to
amuse
my
poor
aye
aye
complacently
put
in
justice
hare
so
it
would
be
richard
had
returned
to
his
home
had
become
to
all
intent
and
purposes
its
master
for
the
justice
would
never
be
in
a
state
to
hold
sway
again
he
had
resumed
his
position
and
regained
the
favor
of
west
lynne
which
always
in
extremes
was
now
wanting
to
kill
him
with
kindness
a
happy
happy
home
from
henceforth
and
hare
lifted
up
her
full
heart
in
thankfulness
to
god
perhaps
richard
s
went
up
also
one
word
touching
that
wretched
prisoner
in
the
condemned
cell
at
lynneborough
as
you
must
have
anticipated
the
extreme
sentence
was
not
carried
out
and
little
favorite
as
sir
francis
is
with
you
and
with
me
we
can
but
admit
that
justice
did
not
demand
that
it
should
be
that
he
had
willfully
killed
hallijohn
was
certain
but
the
act
was
committed
in
a
moment
of
wild
rage
it
had
not
been
premeditated
the
sentence
was
commuted
to
transportation
a
far
more
disgraceful
one
in
the
estimation
of
sir
francis
a
far
more
unwelcome
one
in
the
eyes
of
his
wife
it
is
no
use
to
mince
the
truth
one
little
grain
of
comfort
had
penetrated
to
lady
levison
the
anticipation
of
the
time
when
she
and
her
child
should
be
alone
and
could
hide
themselves
in
some
hidden
nook
of
the
wide
world
he
and
his
crime
and
his
end
gone
forgotten
but
it
seems
he
was
not
to
go
and
be
forgotten
she
and
the
boy
must
be
tied
to
him
still
and
she
was
lost
in
horror
and
rebellion
he
envied
the
dead
hallijohn
did
that
man
as
he
looked
forth
on
the
future
a
cheering
prospect
truly
the
gay
sir
francis
levison
working
in
chains
with
his
gang
where
would
his
diamonds
and
his
perfumed
handkerchiefs
and
his
white
hands
be
then
after
a
time
he
might
get
a
he
groaned
in
agony
as
the
turnkey
suggested
it
to
him
a
for
him
oh
why
did
they
not
hang
him
he
wailed
forth
as
he
closed
his
eyes
to
the
dim
light
the
light
of
the
cell
you
understand
he
could
not
close
them
to
the
light
of
the
future
no
never
again
it
shone
out
all
too
plainly
dazzling
his
brain
as
with
a
flame
of
living
fire

homme
propose
et
dieu
dispose
an
exemplification
of
it
was
here
she
lady
isabel
had
consented
to
remain
at
east
lynne
during
carlyle
s
absence
on
purpose
that
she
might
be
with
her
children
but
the
object
was
frustrated
for
lucy
and
archibald
had
been
removed
to
miss
carlyle
s
it
was
carlyle
s
arrangement
he
thought
the
governess
ought
to
have
entire
respite
from
all
charge
and
that
poor
governess
dared
not
say
let
them
stay
with
me
lady
isabel
had
also
purposed
to
be
safely
away
from
east
lynne
before
the
time
came
for
her
to
die
but
that
time
had
advanced
with
giant
strides
and
the
period
for
removal
was
past
she
was
going
out
as
her
mother
had
done
rapidly
unexpectedly
like
the
snuff
of
a
wilson
was
in
attendance
on
her
mistress
joyce
remained
at
home
barbara
had
chosen
a
near
not
thirty
miles
off
so
that
carlyle
went
there
most
evenings
returning
to
his
office
in
the
mornings
thus
he
saw
little
of
east
lynne
paying
one
or
two
flying
visits
only
from
the
saturday
to
the
wednesday
in
the
second
week
he
did
not
come
home
at
all
and
it
was
in
those
few
days
that
lady
isabel
had
changed
for
the
worse
on
the
wednesday
he
was
expected
home
to
dinner
and
to
sleep
joyce
was
in
a
state
of
frenzy
or
next
door
to
it
lady
isabel
was
dying
and
what
would
become
of
the
ominous
secret
a
conviction
born
of
her
fears
was
on
the
girl
s
mind
that
with
death
the
whole
must
become
known
and
who
was
to
foresee
what
blame
might
not
be
cast
upon
her
by
her
master
and
mistress
for
not
having
disclosed
it
she
might
be
accused
of
having
been
an
abettor
in
the
plot
from
the
first
fifty
times
it
was
in
joyce
s
mind
to
send
for
miss
carlyle
and
tell
her
all
the
afternoon
was
fast
waning
and
the
spirit
of
lady
isabel
seemed
to
be
waning
with
it
joyce
was
in
the
room
in
attendance
upon
her
she
had
been
in
a
fainting
state
all
day
but
felt
better
now
she
was
partially
raised
in
bed
by
pillows
a
white
cashmere
shawl
over
her
shoulders
her
nightcap
off
to
allow
as
much
air
as
possible
to
come
to
her
and
the
windows
stood
open
footsteps
sounded
on
the
gravel
in
the
quiet
stillness
of
the
summer
air
they
penetrated
even
to
her
ear
for
all
her
faculties
were
keen
yet
beloved
footsteps
and
a
tinge
of
hectic
rose
to
her
cheeks
joyce
who
stood
at
the
window
glanced
out
it
was
carlyle
joyce
came
forth
a
cry
from
the
bed
sharp
and
eager
joyce
turned
round
my
lady
i
should
die
happily
if
i
might
see
see
him
uttered
joyce
doubting
her
own
ears
my
lady
see
him
carlyle
what
can
it
signify
i
am
already
as
one
dead
should
i
ask
it
or
wish
it
think
you
in
rude
life
the
yearning
has
been
upon
me
for
days
joyce
it
is
keeping
death
it
could
not
be
my
lady
was
the
decisive
answer
it
must
not
be
it
is
as
a
thing
lady
isabel
burst
into
tears
i
can
t
die
for
the
trouble
she
wailed
you
keep
my
children
from
me
they
must
not
come
you
say
lest
i
should
betray
myself
now
you
would
keep
my
husband
joyce
joyce
let
me
see
him
her
husband
poor
thing
joyce
was
in
a
maze
of
distress
though
not
the
less
firm
her
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
but
she
believed
she
should
be
infringing
her
allegiance
to
her
mistress
did
she
bring
carlyle
to
the
presence
of
his
former
wife
altogether
it
might
be
productive
of
nothing
but
confusion
a
knock
at
the
chamber
door
joyce
called
out
come
the
two
maids
hannah
and
sarah
were
alone
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
room
and
neither
of
them
had
ever
known
madame
vine
as
lady
isabel
sarah
put
in
her
head
master
wants
you
miss
i
ll
he
is
in
the
i
have
just
taken
down
master
arthur
to
carlyle
had
got
master
arthur
on
his
shoulder
when
joyce
entered
master
arthur
was
decidedly
given
to
noise
and
rebellion
and
was
already
as
wilson
expressed
it
sturdy
upon
his
how
is
madame
vine
joyce
joyce
scarcely
knew
how
to
answer
but
she
did
not
dare
to
equivocate
as
to
her
precarious
state
and
where
the
use
when
a
few
hours
would
probably
see
the
end
of
it
she
is
very
ill
indeed
worse
sir
i
fear
she
is
carlyle
in
his
consternation
put
down
arthur
dying
i
hardly
think
she
will
last
till
morning
sir
why
what
has
killed
her
he
uttered
in
amazement
joyce
did
not
answer
she
looked
pale
and
confused
have
you
had
martin
oh
no
sir
it
would
be
of
no
no
use
repeated
carlyle
in
a
sharp
accent
is
that
the
way
to
treat
dying
people
assume
it
is
of
no
use
to
send
for
advice
and
so
quietly
let
them
die
if
madame
vine
is
as
ill
as
you
say
a
telegraphic
message
must
be
sent
off
at
once
i
had
better
see
her
he
cried
moving
to
the
door
joyce
in
her
perplexity
dared
to
place
her
back
against
it
preventing
his
egress
oh
master
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
would
not
be
right
please
sir
do
not
think
of
going
into
her
room
carlyle
thought
joyce
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
prudery
why
can
t
i
go
in
he
asked
mrs
carlyle
would
not
like
it
sir
stammered
joyce
her
cheeks
scarlet
now
carlyle
stared
at
her
some
of
you
take
up
odd
ideas
he
cried
in
carlyle
s
absence
it
is
necessary
that
some
one
should
see
her
let
a
lady
die
in
my
house
and
never
see
after
her
you
are
out
of
your
senses
joyce
i
shall
go
in
after
dinner
so
prepare
madame
the
dinner
was
being
brought
in
then
joyce
feeling
like
one
in
a
nervous
attack
picked
up
arthur
and
carried
him
to
sarah
in
the
nursery
what
on
earth
was
she
to
do
scarcely
had
carlyle
begun
his
dinner
when
his
sister
entered
some
grievance
had
arisen
between
her
and
the
tenants
of
certain
houses
of
hers
and
she
was
bringing
the
dispute
to
him
before
he
would
hear
it
he
begged
her
to
go
up
to
madame
vine
telling
her
what
joyce
had
said
of
her
state
dying
exclaimed
miss
corny
in
disbelieving
derision
that
joyce
has
been
more
like
a
simpleton
lately
than
like
herself
i
can
t
think
what
has
come
to
the
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
mantle
and
laid
them
on
a
chair
gave
a
twitch
or
two
to
her
cap
as
she
surveyed
it
in
the
and
went
upstairs
joyce
answered
her
knock
at
the
invalid
s
door
and
joyce
when
she
saw
who
it
was
turned
as
white
as
any
sheet
oh
ma
am
you
must
not
come
in
she
blundered
out
in
her
confusion
and
fear
as
she
put
herself
right
in
the
doorway
who
is
to
keep
me
out
demanded
miss
carlyle
after
a
pause
of
surprise
her
tone
of
quiet
power
move
away
girl
joyce
i
think
your
brain
must
be
softening
what
will
you
try
at
next
joyce
was
powerless
both
in
right
and
strength
and
she
knew
it
she
knew
there
was
no
help
that
miss
carlyle
would
and
must
enter
she
stood
aside
shivering
and
passed
out
of
the
room
as
soon
as
miss
carlyle
was
within
it
ah
there
could
no
longer
be
concealment
now
there
she
was
her
pale
face
lying
against
the
pillow
free
from
its
disguising
trappings
the
band
of
gray
velvet
the
spectacles
the
wraps
for
the
throat
and
chin
the
huge
cap
all
were
gone
it
was
the
face
of
lady
isabel
changed
certainly
very
very
much
but
still
hers
the
silvered
hair
fell
on
either
side
of
her
face
like
the
silky
curls
had
once
fallen
the
sweet
sad
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
yore
mercy
be
good
to
us
uttered
miss
carlyle
they
remained
gazing
at
each
other
both
panting
with
emotion
yes
even
miss
carlyle
though
a
wild
suspicion
had
once
crossed
her
brain
that
madame
vine
might
be
lady
isabel
it
had
died
away
again
from
the
sheer
improbability
of
the
thing
as
much
as
from
the
convincing
proofs
offered
by
lord
mount
severn
not
but
what
miss
carlyle
had
borne
in
mind
the
suspicion
and
had
been
fond
of
tracing
the
likeness
in
madame
vine
s
face
how
could
you
dare
come
back
here
she
abruptly
asked
her
tone
of
sad
soft
wailing
not
one
of
reproach
lady
isabel
humbly
crossed
her
attenuated
hands
upon
her
chest
my
children
she
whispered
how
could
i
stay
away
from
them
have
pity
miss
carlyle
don
t
reproach
me
i
am
on
my
way
to
god
to
answer
for
all
my
sins
and
i
do
not
reproach
you
said
miss
carlyle
i
am
so
glad
to
go
she
continued
to
murmur
her
eyes
full
of
tears
jesus
did
not
come
you
know
to
save
the
good
like
you
he
came
for
the
sake
of
us
poor
sinners
i
tried
to
take
up
my
cross
as
he
bade
us
and
bear
it
bravely
for
his
sake
but
its
weight
has
killed
the
good
like
you
humbly
meekly
deferentially
was
it
expressed
in
all
good
faith
and
trust
as
though
miss
corny
was
a
sort
of
upper
angel
somehow
the
words
grated
on
miss
corny
s
ear
grated
fiercely
on
her
conscience
it
came
into
her
mind
then
as
she
stood
there
that
the
harsh
religion
that
she
had
through
life
professed
was
not
the
religion
that
would
best
bring
peace
to
her
dying
bed
child
said
she
drawing
near
to
and
leaning
over
lady
isabel
had
i
anything
to
do
with
sending
you
from
east
lynne
lady
isabel
shook
her
head
and
cast
down
her
gaze
as
she
whispered
you
did
not
send
me
you
did
not
help
to
send
me
i
was
not
very
happy
with
you
but
that
was
not
the
cause
of
my
going
away
forgive
me
miss
carlyle
forgive
me
thank
god
inwardly
breathed
miss
carlyle
forgive
me
she
said
aloud
and
in
agitation
touching
her
hand
i
could
have
made
your
home
happier
and
i
wish
i
had
done
it
i
have
wished
it
ever
since
you
left
lady
isabel
drew
the
hand
in
hers
i
want
to
see
archibald
she
whispered
going
back
in
thought
to
the
old
time
and
the
old
name
i
have
prayed
joyce
to
bring
him
to
me
and
she
will
not
only
for
a
minute
just
to
hear
him
say
that
he
forgives
me
what
can
it
matter
now
that
i
am
as
one
lost
to
the
world
i
should
die
upon
what
impulse
or
grounds
miss
carlyle
saw
fit
to
accede
to
the
request
can
not
be
told
probably
she
did
not
choose
to
refuse
a
bed
prayer
possibly
she
reasoned
as
did
lady
isabel
what
could
it
matter
she
went
to
the
door
joyce
was
in
the
corridor
leaning
against
the
wall
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
miss
carlyle
beckoned
to
her
how
long
have
you
known
of
this
since
that
night
in
the
spring
when
there
was
an
alarm
of
fire
i
saw
her
then
with
nothing
on
her
face
and
knew
her
though
at
the
first
moment
i
thought
it
was
her
ghost
ma
am
i
have
just
gone
about
since
like
a
ghost
myself
from
go
and
request
your
master
to
come
up
to
oh
ma
am
will
it
be
well
to
tell
him
remonstrated
joyce
well
that
he
should
see
her
go
and
request
your
master
to
come
to
me
unequivocally
repeated
miss
carlyle
are
you
mistress
joyce
or
am
i
joyce
went
down
and
brought
carlyle
up
from
the
is
madame
vine
worse
cornelia
will
she
see
me
she
wishes
to
see
miss
carlyle
opened
the
door
as
she
spoke
he
motioned
her
to
pass
in
first
no
she
said
you
had
better
see
her
he
was
going
in
when
joyce
caught
his
arm
master
master
you
ought
to
be
prepared
ma
am
won
t
you
tell
him
he
looked
at
them
thinking
they
must
be
moonstruck
for
their
conduct
seemed
inexplicable
both
were
in
evident
agitation
an
emotion
miss
carlyle
was
not
given
to
her
face
and
lips
were
twitching
but
she
kept
a
studied
silence
carlyle
knit
his
brow
and
went
into
the
chamber
they
shut
him
in
he
walked
gently
at
once
to
the
bed
in
his
straightforward
manner
i
am
grieved
madame
vine
the
words
faltered
on
his
tongue
he
was
a
man
as
little
given
to
show
emotion
as
man
can
well
be
did
he
think
as
joyce
had
once
done
that
it
was
a
ghost
he
saw
certain
it
is
that
his
face
and
lips
turned
the
hue
of
death
and
he
backed
a
few
steps
from
the
bed
the
falling
hair
the
sweet
mournful
eyes
the
hectic
which
his
presence
brought
to
her
cheeks
told
too
plainly
of
the
lady
isabel
archibald
she
put
out
her
trembling
hand
she
caught
him
ere
he
had
drawn
quite
beyond
her
reach
he
looked
at
her
he
looked
round
the
room
as
does
one
awaking
from
a
dream
i
could
not
die
without
your
forgiveness
she
murmured
her
eyes
falling
before
him
as
she
thought
of
her
past
do
you
turn
from
me
bear
with
me
a
little
minute
only
say
you
forgive
me
and
i
shall
die
in
peace
isabel
he
spoke
not
knowing
in
the
least
what
he
said
are
you
are
you
were
you
madame
vine
oh
forgive
forgive
me
i
did
not
die
i
got
well
from
the
accident
but
it
changed
me
dreadfully
nobody
knew
me
and
i
came
here
as
madame
vine
i
could
not
stay
away
archibald
forgive
me
his
mind
was
in
a
whirl
his
ideas
had
gone
the
first
clear
thought
that
came
thumping
through
his
brain
was
that
he
must
be
a
man
of
two
wives
she
noticed
his
perplexed
silence
i
could
not
stay
away
from
you
and
my
children
the
longing
for
you
was
killing
me
she
reiterated
wildly
like
one
talking
in
a
fever
i
never
knew
a
moment
s
peace
after
the
mad
act
i
was
guilty
of
in
quitting
you
not
an
hour
had
i
departed
when
my
repentance
set
in
and
even
then
i
would
have
retraced
and
come
back
but
i
did
not
know
how
see
what
it
has
done
for
me
tossing
up
her
gray
hair
holding
out
her
attenuated
wrists
oh
forgive
forgive
me
my
sin
was
great
but
my
punishment
was
greater
it
has
been
as
one
long
scene
of
mortal
why
did
you
go
asked
carlyle
did
you
not
know
no
it
has
always
been
a
mystery
to
i
went
out
of
love
for
a
shade
of
disdain
crossed
his
lips
she
was
equivocating
to
him
on
her
do
not
look
in
that
way
she
panted
my
strength
is
nearly
gone
you
must
perceive
that
it
is
and
i
do
not
perhaps
express
myself
clearly
i
loved
you
dearly
and
i
grew
suspicious
of
you
i
thought
you
were
false
and
deceitful
to
me
that
your
love
was
all
given
to
another
and
in
my
sore
jealousy
i
listened
to
the
temptings
of
that
bad
man
who
whispered
to
me
of
revenge
it
was
not
so
was
it
carlyle
had
regained
his
calmness
outwardly
at
any
rate
he
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
looking
down
upon
her
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
chest
and
his
noble
form
raised
to
its
full
height
was
it
so
she
feverishly
repeated
can
you
ask
it
knowing
me
as
you
did
then
as
you
must
have
known
me
since
i
never
was
false
to
you
in
thought
in
word
or
in
oh
archibald
i
was
mad
i
was
mad
i
could
not
have
done
it
in
anything
but
madness
surely
you
will
forget
and
forgive
i
can
not
forget
i
have
already
forgiven
try
and
forget
the
dreadful
time
that
has
passed
since
that
night
she
continued
the
tears
falling
on
her
cheeks
as
she
held
up
to
him
one
of
her
poor
hot
hands
let
your
thoughts
go
back
to
the
days
when
you
first
knew
me
when
i
was
here
isabel
vane
a
happy
girl
with
my
father
at
times
i
have
lost
myself
in
a
moment
s
happiness
in
thinking
of
it
do
you
remember
how
you
grew
to
love
me
though
you
thought
you
might
not
tell
it
to
me
and
how
gentle
you
were
with
me
when
papa
died
and
the
hundred
pound
note
do
you
remember
coming
to
castle
marling
and
my
promise
to
be
your
wife
and
the
first
kiss
you
left
upon
my
lips
and
oh
archibald
do
you
remember
the
loving
days
after
i
was
your
wife
how
happy
we
were
with
each
other
do
you
remember
when
lucy
was
born
we
thought
i
should
have
died
and
your
joy
your
thankfulness
that
god
restored
me
do
you
remember
all
this
aye
he
did
remember
it
he
took
the
poor
hand
into
his
and
unconsciously
played
with
its
wasted
fingers
have
you
any
reproach
to
cast
to
me
he
gently
said
bending
his
head
a
little
reproach
to
you
to
you
who
must
be
almost
without
reproach
in
the
sight
of
heaven
you
who
were
everlasting
to
me
ever
anxious
for
my
welfare
when
i
think
of
what
you
were
and
are
and
how
i
quitted
you
i
could
sink
into
the
earth
with
remorse
and
shame
my
own
sin
i
have
surely
expiated
i
can
not
expiate
the
shame
i
entailed
upon
you
and
upon
our
never
he
felt
it
as
keenly
now
as
he
had
felt
it
then
think
what
it
has
been
for
me
she
resumed
and
he
was
obliged
to
bend
his
ear
to
catch
her
gradually
weakening
tones
to
live
in
this
house
with
your
wife
to
see
your
love
for
her
to
watch
the
envied
caresses
that
once
were
mine
i
never
loved
you
so
passionately
as
i
have
done
since
i
lost
you
think
what
it
was
to
watch
william
s
decaying
strength
to
be
alone
with
him
in
his
dying
hour
and
not
to
be
able
to
say
he
is
my
child
as
well
as
yours
when
he
lay
dead
and
the
news
went
forth
to
the
household
it
was
her
petty
grief
you
soothed
not
mine
his
mother
s
god
alone
knows
how
i
have
lived
through
it
all
it
has
been
to
me
as
the
bitterness
of
why
did
you
come
back
was
the
response
of
carlyle
i
have
told
you
i
could
not
live
wanting
you
and
my
it
was
wrong
wrong
in
all
wickedly
wrong
you
can
not
think
worse
of
it
than
i
have
done
but
the
consequences
and
the
punishment
would
be
mine
alone
as
long
as
i
guarded
against
discovery
i
never
thought
to
stop
here
to
die
but
death
seems
to
have
come
on
me
with
a
leap
like
it
came
to
my
a
pause
of
labored
hard
breathing
carlyle
did
not
interrupt
it
all
wrong
all
wrong
she
resumed
this
interview
with
you
among
the
rest
and
yet
i
hardly
know
it
can
not
hurt
the
new
ties
you
have
formed
for
i
am
as
one
dead
now
to
this
world
hovering
on
the
brink
of
the
next
but
you
were
my
husband
archibald
and
the
last
few
days
i
have
longed
for
your
forgiveness
with
a
fevered
longing
oh
that
the
past
could
be
blotted
out
that
i
could
wake
up
and
find
it
but
a
hideous
dream
that
i
were
here
as
in
old
days
in
health
and
happiness
your
ever
loving
wife
do
you
wish
it
that
the
dark
past
had
never
had
place
she
put
the
question
in
a
sharp
eager
tone
gazing
up
to
him
with
an
anxious
gaze
as
though
the
answer
must
be
one
of
life
or
death
for
your
sake
i
wish
calm
enough
were
the
words
spoken
and
her
eyes
fell
again
and
a
deep
sigh
came
forth
i
am
going
to
william
but
lucy
and
archibald
will
be
left
oh
do
you
never
be
unkind
to
them
i
pray
you
visit
not
their
mother
s
sin
upon
their
heads
do
not
in
your
love
for
your
later
children
lose
your
love
for
them
have
you
seen
anything
in
my
conduct
that
could
give
rise
to
fears
of
this
he
returned
reproach
mingled
in
his
sad
tone
the
children
are
dear
to
me
as
you
once
as
i
once
was
aye
and
as
i
might
have
been
indeed
you
might
he
answered
with
emotion
the
fault
was
not
archibald
i
am
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
next
world
will
you
not
bless
me
will
you
not
say
a
word
of
love
to
me
before
i
pass
it
let
what
i
am
i
say
be
blotted
for
the
moment
from
your
memory
think
of
me
if
you
can
as
the
innocent
timid
child
whom
you
made
your
wife
only
a
word
of
love
my
heart
is
breaking
for
he
leaned
over
her
he
pushed
aside
the
hair
from
her
brow
with
his
gentle
hand
his
tears
dropping
on
her
face
you
nearly
broke
mine
when
you
left
me
isabel
he
whispered
may
god
bless
you
and
take
you
to
his
rest
in
heaven
may
he
so
deal
with
me
as
i
now
fully
and
freely
forgive
what
was
he
about
to
do
lower
and
lower
bent
his
head
until
his
breath
nearly
mingled
with
hers
to
kiss
her
he
best
knew
but
suddenly
his
face
grew
red
with
a
scarlet
flush
and
he
lifted
it
again
did
the
form
of
one
then
in
a
felon
s
cell
at
lynneborough
thrust
itself
before
him
or
that
of
his
absent
and
unconscious
wife
to
his
rest
in
heaven
she
murmured
in
the
hollow
tones
of
the
departing
yes
yes
i
know
that
god
has
forgiven
me
oh
what
a
struggle
it
has
been
nothing
but
bad
feelings
rebellion
and
sorrow
and
repining
for
a
long
while
after
i
came
back
here
but
jesus
prayed
for
me
and
helped
me
and
you
know
how
merciful
he
is
to
the
weary
and
we
shall
meet
again
archibald
and
live
together
forever
and
ever
but
for
that
great
hope
i
could
hardly
die
william
said
mamma
would
be
on
the
banks
of
the
river
looking
out
for
him
but
it
is
william
who
is
looking
for
carlyle
released
one
of
his
hands
she
had
taken
them
both
and
with
his
own
white
handkerchief
wiped
the
from
her
forehead
it
is
no
sin
to
anticipate
it
archibald
for
there
will
be
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
in
heaven
christ
said
so
though
we
do
not
know
how
it
will
be
my
sin
will
be
remembered
no
more
there
and
we
shall
be
together
with
our
children
forever
and
forever
keep
a
little
corner
in
your
heart
for
your
poor
lost
yes
yes
he
whispered
are
you
leaving
me
she
uttered
in
a
wild
tone
of
pain
you
are
growing
faint
i
perceive
i
must
call
farewell
then
farewell
until
eternity
she
sighed
the
tears
raining
from
her
eyes
it
is
death
i
think
not
faintness
oh
but
it
is
hard
to
part
farewell
farewell
my
once
dear
husband
she
raised
her
head
from
the
pillow
excitement
giving
her
strength
she
clung
to
his
arm
she
lifted
her
face
in
its
sad
yearning
carlyle
laid
her
tenderly
down
again
and
suffered
his
wet
cheek
to
rest
upon
hers
until
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
as
he
retreated
and
watched
him
from
the
room
then
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
it
is
over
only
god
carlyle
took
an
instant
s
counsel
with
himself
stopping
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
do
it
joyce
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
him
had
already
gone
into
the
his
sister
was
standing
at
the
door
she
followed
him
down
to
the
you
will
remain
here
with
her
do
you
suppose
i
shouldn
t
crossly
responded
miss
corny
where
are
you
off
to
now
to
the
telegraph
office
at
present
to
send
for
lord
mount
what
good
can
he
do
none
but
i
shall
send
for
can
t
one
of
the
servants
go
just
as
well
as
you
you
have
not
finished
your
dinner
hardly
begun
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
his
mind
wholly
preoccupied
made
some
remark
in
answer
which
miss
corny
did
not
catch
and
went
out
on
his
return
his
sister
met
him
in
the
hall
drew
him
inside
the
nearest
room
and
closed
the
door
lady
isabel
was
dead
had
been
dead
about
ten
minutes
she
never
spoke
after
you
left
her
archibald
there
was
a
slight
struggle
at
the
last
a
fighting
for
breath
otherwise
she
went
off
quite
peacefully
i
felt
sure
when
i
first
saw
her
this
afternoon
that
she
could
not
last
till
chapter
xlvii
lord
mount
severn
wondering
greatly
what
the
urgent
summons
could
be
for
lost
no
time
in
obeying
it
and
was
at
east
lynne
the
following
morning
early
carlyle
had
his
carriage
at
the
station
his
close
carriage
and
shut
up
in
that
he
made
the
communication
to
the
earl
as
they
drove
to
east
lynne
the
earl
could
with
difficulty
believe
it
never
had
he
been
so
utterly
astonished
at
first
he
really
could
not
understand
the
tale
did
she
did
she
come
back
to
your
house
to
die
he
blundered
you
never
took
her
in
i
don
t
carlyle
explained
further
and
the
earl
at
length
understood
but
he
did
not
recover
his
perplexed
astonishment
what
a
mad
act
to
come
back
here
madame
vine
how
on
earth
did
she
escape
detection
she
did
escape
it
said
carlyle
the
strange
likeness
madame
vine
possessed
to
my
first
wife
did
often
strike
me
as
being
marvelous
but
i
never
suspected
the
truth
it
was
a
likeness
and
not
a
likeness
for
every
part
of
her
face
and
form
was
changed
except
her
eyes
and
those
i
never
saw
but
through
those
disguising
the
earl
wiped
his
hot
face
the
news
had
ruffled
him
no
measured
degree
he
felt
angry
with
isabel
dead
though
she
was
and
thankful
that
carlyle
was
away
will
you
see
her
whispered
carlyle
as
they
entered
the
house
they
went
up
to
the
carlyle
procuring
the
key
it
was
the
only
time
that
he
entered
it
very
peaceful
she
looked
now
her
pale
features
so
composed
under
her
white
cap
and
hands
miss
carlyle
and
joyce
had
done
all
that
was
necessary
nobody
else
had
been
suffered
to
approach
her
lord
mount
severn
leaned
over
her
tracing
the
former
looks
of
isabel
and
the
likeness
grew
upon
him
in
a
wonderful
degree
what
did
she
die
of
he
asked
she
said
a
broken
ah
said
the
earl
the
wonder
is
that
it
did
not
break
before
poor
thing
poor
isabel
he
added
touching
her
hand
how
she
marred
her
own
happiness
carlyle
i
suppose
this
is
your
wedding
ring
carlyle
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ring
very
to
think
of
her
never
having
discarded
it
remarked
the
earl
releasing
the
cold
hand
well
i
can
hardly
believe
the
tale
he
turned
and
quitted
the
room
as
he
spoke
carlyle
looked
steadfastly
at
the
dead
face
for
a
minute
or
two
his
fingers
touching
the
forehead
but
what
his
thoughts
or
feelings
may
have
been
none
can
tell
then
he
replaced
the
sheet
over
her
face
and
followed
the
earl
they
descended
in
silence
to
the
miss
carlyle
was
seated
at
the
table
waiting
for
them
where
could
all
your
eyes
have
been
exclaimed
the
earl
to
her
after
a
few
sentences
referring
to
the
event
just
passed
just
where
yours
would
have
been
replied
miss
corny
with
a
touch
of
her
old
temper
you
saw
madame
vine
as
well
as
we
but
not
continuously
only
two
or
three
times
in
all
and
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
her
without
her
bonnet
and
veil
that
carlyle
should
not
have
recognized
her
is
almost
beyond
it
seems
so
to
speak
of
it
said
miss
corny
but
facts
are
facts
she
was
young
and
gay
active
when
she
left
here
upright
as
a
dart
her
dark
hair
drawn
from
her
open
brow
and
flowing
on
her
neck
her
cheeks
like
crimson
paint
her
face
altogether
beautiful
madame
vine
arrived
here
a
pale
stooping
woman
lame
of
one
leg
shorter
than
lady
isabel
and
her
figure
stuffed
out
under
those
sacks
of
jackets
not
a
bit
scarcely
of
her
forehead
to
be
seen
for
gray
velvet
and
gray
bands
of
hair
her
head
smothered
under
a
close
cap
large
blue
double
spectacles
hiding
the
eyes
and
their
sides
and
the
throat
tied
up
the
chin
partially
the
mouth
was
entirely
altered
in
its
character
and
that
upward
scar
always
so
conspicuous
made
it
almost
ugly
then
she
had
lost
some
of
her
front
teeth
you
know
and
she
lisped
when
she
spoke
take
her
for
all
in
all
summed
up
miss
carlyle
she
looked
no
more
like
isabel
who
went
away
from
here
than
i
look
like
adam
just
get
your
dearest
friend
damaged
and
disguised
as
she
was
my
lord
and
see
if
you
d
recognize
the
observation
came
home
to
lord
mount
severn
a
gentleman
whom
he
knew
well
had
been
so
altered
by
a
fearful
accident
that
little
resemblance
could
be
traced
to
his
former
self
in
fact
his
own
family
could
not
recognize
him
and
he
used
an
artificial
disguise
it
was
a
case
in
point
and
reader
i
assure
you
it
was
a
true
one
it
was
the
disguise
that
we
ought
to
have
suspected
quietly
observed
carlyle
the
likeness
was
not
sufficiently
striking
to
cause
but
she
turned
the
house
from
that
scent
as
soon
as
she
came
into
it
struck
in
miss
corny
telling
of
the
neuralgic
pains
that
affected
her
head
and
face
rendering
the
guarding
them
from
exposure
necessary
remember
lord
mount
severn
that
the
ducies
had
been
with
her
in
germany
and
had
never
suspected
her
remember
also
another
thing
that
however
great
a
likeness
we
may
have
detected
we
could
not
and
did
not
speak
of
it
one
to
another
lady
isabel
s
name
is
never
so
much
as
whispered
among
true
all
true
nodded
the
earl
and
they
sat
themselves
down
to
breakfast
on
the
friday
the
following
letter
was
dispatched
to
carlyle
my
dearest
i
find
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
to
you
on
saturday
afternoon
as
i
promised
but
will
leave
here
by
the
late
train
that
night
mind
you
don
t
sit
up
for
me
lord
mount
severn
is
here
for
a
few
days
he
sends
his
regards
to
you
and
now
barbara
prepare
for
news
that
will
prove
a
shock
madame
vine
is
dead
she
grew
rapidly
worse
they
tell
me
after
our
departure
and
died
on
wednesday
night
i
am
glad
you
were
away
love
from
the
children
lucy
and
archie
are
still
at
cornelia
s
arthur
wearing
out
sarah
s
legs
in
the
nursery
ever
yours
my
dearest
archibald
of
course
as
madame
vine
the
governess
died
at
carlyle
s
house
he
could
not
in
courtesy
do
less
than
follow
her
to
the
grave
so
decided
west
lynne
when
they
found
which
way
the
wind
was
going
to
blow
lord
mount
severn
followed
also
to
keep
him
company
being
on
a
visit
to
him
and
very
polite
indeed
of
his
lordship
to
do
it
condescending
also
west
lynne
remembered
another
funeral
at
which
those
two
had
been
the
only
mourners
that
of
the
earl
by
some
curious
coincidence
the
french
governess
was
buried
close
to
the
earl
s
grave
as
good
there
as
anywhere
else
quoth
west
lynne
there
happened
to
be
a
vacant
spot
of
ground
the
funeral
took
place
on
a
sunday
morning
a
plain
respectable
funeral
a
hearse
and
pair
and
mourning
coach
and
pair
with
a
chariot
for
the
rev
little
no
or
mutes
or
anything
of
that
kind
and
no
plumes
on
the
horses
only
on
the
hearse
west
lynne
looked
on
with
approbation
and
conjectured
that
the
governess
had
left
sufficient
money
to
bury
herself
but
of
course
that
was
carlyle
s
affair
not
west
lynne
s
quiet
enough
lay
she
in
her
last
they
left
her
in
it
the
earl
and
carlyle
and
entered
the
coach
to
be
conveyed
back
again
to
east
lynne
just
a
little
stone
of
white
marble
two
feet
high
by
a
foot
and
a
half
broad
remarked
the
earl
on
their
road
pursuing
a
topic
they
were
speaking
upon
with
the
initials
i
and
the
date
of
the
year
nothing
more
what
do
you
think
i
corrected
carlyle
at
this
moment
the
bells
of
another
church
not
jude
s
broke
out
in
a
joyous
peal
and
the
earl
inclined
his
ear
to
listen
what
can
they
be
ringing
for
he
cried
they
were
ringing
for
a
wedding
afy
hallijohn
by
the
help
of
two
clergymen
and
six
bridesmaids
of
which
you
may
be
sure
joyce
was
not
one
had
just
been
converted
into
joe
jiffin
when
afy
took
a
thing
into
her
head
she
somehow
contrived
to
carry
it
through
and
to
bend
even
clergymen
and
bridesmaids
to
her
will
jiffin
was
blest
at
last
in
the
afternoon
the
earl
left
east
lynne
and
somewhat
later
barbara
arrived
at
it
wilson
scarcely
gave
her
mistress
time
to
step
into
the
house
before
her
and
she
very
nearly
left
the
baby
in
the
fly
curiously
anxious
was
wilson
to
hear
all
particulars
as
to
whatever
could
have
took
off
that
french
governess
carlyle
was
much
surprised
at
their
arrival
how
could
i
stay
away
archibald
even
until
monday
after
the
news
you
sent
me
said
barbara
what
did
she
die
of
it
must
have
been
awfully
i
suppose
so
was
his
dreamy
answer
he
was
debating
a
question
with
himself
one
he
had
thought
over
a
good
deal
since
wednesday
night
should
he
or
should
he
not
tell
his
wife
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
tell
her
and
were
the
secret
confined
to
his
own
breast
he
would
decidedly
not
have
done
so
but
it
was
known
to
three
others
to
miss
carlyle
to
lord
mount
severn
and
to
joyce
all
trustworthy
and
of
good
intention
but
it
was
impossible
for
carlyle
to
make
sure
that
not
one
of
them
would
ever
through
any
chance
and
unpremeditated
word
let
the
secret
come
to
the
knowledge
of
carlyle
that
would
not
do
if
she
must
hear
it
at
all
she
must
hear
it
from
him
and
at
once
he
took
his
course
are
you
ill
archibald
she
asked
noting
his
face
it
wore
a
pale
worn
sort
of
look
i
have
something
to
tell
you
barbara
he
answered
drawing
her
hand
into
his
as
they
stood
together
they
were
in
her
where
she
was
taking
off
her
things
on
the
wednesday
evening
when
i
got
home
to
dinner
joyce
told
me
that
she
feared
madame
vine
was
dying
and
i
thought
it
right
to
see
certainly
returned
barbara
quite
i
went
into
her
room
and
i
found
that
she
was
dying
but
i
found
something
else
barbara
she
was
not
madame
not
madame
vine
echoed
barbara
believing
in
good
truth
that
her
husband
could
not
know
what
he
was
saying
it
was
my
former
wife
isabel
barbara
s
face
flushed
crimson
and
then
grew
white
as
marble
and
she
drew
her
hand
unconsciously
from
carlyle
s
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
movement
but
stood
with
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
while
he
talked
giving
her
a
rapid
summary
of
the
interview
and
its
details
she
could
not
stay
away
from
her
children
she
said
and
came
back
as
madame
vine
what
with
the
effects
of
the
railroad
accident
in
france
and
those
spectacles
she
wore
and
her
style
of
dress
and
her
gray
hair
she
felt
secure
in
not
being
recognized
i
am
astonished
now
that
she
was
not
discovered
were
such
a
thing
related
to
me
i
should
give
no
credence
to
barbara
s
heart
felt
faint
with
its
utter
sickness
and
she
turned
her
face
from
the
view
of
her
husband
her
first
confused
thoughts
were
as
carlyle
s
had
been
that
she
had
been
living
in
his
house
with
another
wife
did
you
suspect
her
she
breathed
in
a
low
tone
barbara
had
i
suspected
it
should
i
have
allowed
it
to
go
on
she
implored
my
forgiveness
for
the
past
and
for
having
returned
here
and
i
gave
it
to
her
fully
i
then
went
to
west
lynne
to
telegraph
to
mount
severn
and
when
i
came
back
she
was
there
was
a
pause
carlyle
began
to
perceive
that
his
wife
s
face
was
hidden
from
him
she
said
her
heart
was
broken
barbara
we
can
not
wonder
at
there
was
no
reply
carlyle
took
his
arm
from
the
mantelpiece
and
moved
so
that
he
could
see
her
countenance
a
wan
countenance
telling
of
pain
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
made
her
look
at
him
my
dearest
what
is
this
oh
archibald
she
uttered
clasping
her
hands
together
all
her
pent
up
feelings
bursting
forth
and
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
has
this
taken
your
love
from
me
he
took
both
her
hands
in
one
of
his
he
put
the
other
round
her
waist
and
held
her
there
before
him
never
speaking
only
looking
gravely
into
her
face
who
could
look
at
its
sincere
truthfulness
at
the
sweet
expression
of
his
lips
and
doubt
him
not
barbara
she
allowed
the
moment
s
excitement
to
act
upon
her
feelings
and
carry
her
away
i
had
thought
my
wife
possessed
entire
trust
in
oh
i
do
i
do
you
know
i
do
forgive
me
archibald
she
slowly
whispered
i
deemed
it
better
to
impart
this
to
you
barbara
had
there
been
wrong
feeling
on
my
part
i
should
have
left
you
in
ignorance
my
darling
i
have
told
you
it
in
she
was
leaning
on
his
breast
sobbing
gently
her
repentant
face
turned
towards
him
he
held
her
there
in
his
strong
protection
his
enduring
tenderness
my
wife
my
darling
now
and
it
was
a
foolish
feeling
to
cross
my
heart
archibald
it
is
done
with
and
never
let
it
come
back
barbara
neither
need
her
name
be
mentioned
again
between
us
a
barred
name
it
has
hitherto
been
so
let
it
anything
you
will
my
earnest
wish
is
to
please
you
to
be
worthy
of
your
esteem
and
love
archibald
she
timidly
added
her
drooping
and
her
fair
cheeks
blushing
as
she
made
the
confession
there
has
been
a
feeling
in
my
heart
against
your
children
a
sort
of
jealous
feeling
you
can
understand
because
they
were
hers
because
she
had
once
been
your
wife
i
knew
how
wrong
it
was
and
i
have
tried
earnestly
to
subdue
it
i
have
indeed
and
i
think
it
is
nearly
gone
her
voice
sunk
i
constantly
pray
to
be
helped
to
do
it
to
love
them
and
care
for
them
as
if
they
were
my
own
it
will
come
with
every
good
thing
will
come
with
time
that
we
may
earnestly
seek
said
carlyle
oh
barbara
never
forget
never
forget
that
the
only
way
to
ensure
peace
in
the
end
is
to
strive
always
to
be
doing
right
unselfishly
under
god
