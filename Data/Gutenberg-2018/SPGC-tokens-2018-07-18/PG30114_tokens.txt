pages
form
an
abridged
translation
of
a
book
published
in
by
freiherrn
von
forstner
commander
of
the
first
german
it
was
written
with
the
somewhat
careless
haste
of
a
man
who
took
advantage
of
disconnected
moments
of
leisure
and
these
moments
were
evidently
subject
to
abrupt
and
prolonged
interruptions
many
repetitions
and
trivial
incidents
have
been
omitted
in
this
translation
but
in
order
to
express
the
personality
of
the
author
the
rendering
has
been
as
literal
as
possible
and
it
shows
the
strange
mixture
of
sentimentality
and
ferocity
peculiar
to
the
psychology
of
the
germans
part
of
the
book
gives
a
technical
description
not
so
much
of
the
construction
of
a
submarine
as
of
the
nature
of
its
activities
which
presents
us
an
unusual
opportunity
to
glean
a
few
valuable
facts
from
this
personal
and
intimate
account
of
a
german
we
are
inclined
to
a
certain
grim
humor
in
borrowing
the
candid
information
given
to
us
americans
so
unconsciously
by
freiherrn
von
forstner
for
he
could
hardly
suppose
it
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
would
join
the
fighting
ranks
of
the
as
in
his
bitter
animosity
he
invariably
calls
the
english
whenever
he
refers
to
them
several
chapters
in
this
book
are
simple
narratives
of
the
own
adventures
during
the
present
naval
warfare
waged
against
commerce
his
attempts
at
a
lighter
vein
often
provoke
a
smile
at
the
quality
of
his
wit
but
he
is
not
lacking
in
fine
and
manly
virtues
he
is
a
loyal
comrade
a
good
officer
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
his
crew
he
is
even
kindly
to
his
captives
when
he
finds
they
are
docile
victims
he
is
also
willing
to
credit
his
adversary
with
pluck
and
courage
he
is
never
sparing
of
his
own
person
and
shows
admirable
endurance
under
pressure
of
intense
work
and
great
responsibility
he
is
full
of
enthusiastic
love
for
his
profession
and
in
describing
a
storm
at
sea
his
rather
monotonous
style
of
writing
suddenly
rises
to
eloquence
but
in
his
exalted
devotion
to
the
almighty
war
lord
and
to
the
fatherland
he
openly
reveals
his
fanatical
joy
in
the
nefarious
work
he
has
to
perform
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
this
ardent
worship
of
detail
and
this
marvelous
efficiency
in
the
conservation
of
every
resource
are
applied
to
a
weapon
of
destruction
which
directs
its
indiscriminate
attacks
against
women
and
children
hospital
transports
and
relief
ships
nothing
at
the
present
day
has
aroused
such
fear
as
this
invisible
enemy
nor
has
anything
outraged
the
civilized
world
like
the
tragedies
caused
by
the
german
submarines
this
small
volume
may
offer
new
suggestions
to
those
familiar
with
the
science
of
submarine
construction
and
it
may
also
shed
a
little
light
even
for
lay
readers
on
a
subject
which
for
the
last
three
years
has
taken
a
preëminent
place
in
the
history
of
the
war
introduction
the
challenge
to
naval
supremacy
i
in
a
letter
to
william
pitt
of
january
relating
to
his
invention
of
a
submersible
boat
robert
fulton
wrote
prophetically
now
in
this
business
i
will
not
disguise
that
i
have
full
confidence
in
the
power
which
i
possess
which
is
no
less
than
to
be
the
means
should
i
think
proper
of
giving
to
the
world
a
system
which
must
of
necessity
sweep
all
military
marines
from
the
ocean
by
giving
the
weaker
maritime
powers
advantages
over
the
stronger
which
the
stronger
can
not
prevent
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
about
a
hundred
years
later
fournier
of
the
french
navy
stated
before
a
parliamentary
committee
of
investigation
that
if
france
had
possessed
a
sufficient
number
of
submersibles
and
had
disposed
them
strategically
about
her
coasts
and
the
coasts
of
her
possessions
these
vessels
could
have
controlled
the
trade
routes
of
the
world
he
said
also
that
the
fighting
value
of
a
sufficient
number
of
submersibles
would
reëstablish
the
balance
of
power
between
england
and
france
the
history
of
naval
warfare
during
the
last
few
months
has
confirmed
the
opinions
of
these
two
authorities
although
in
a
manner
which
they
in
no
way
anticipated
direct
comparison
is
the
usual
method
by
which
the
human
mind
estimates
values
we
would
measure
the
strength
of
two
men
by
pitting
them
against
each
other
in
physical
encounter
in
the
same
way
we
are
prone
to
measure
the
combative
effect
of
weapons
by
pitting
them
in
conflict
against
other
weapons
but
modern
warfare
is
of
so
complex
a
nature
that
direct
comparisons
fail
and
only
a
careful
analysis
of
military
experience
determines
the
potentiality
of
a
weapon
and
its
influence
on
warfare
robert
fulton
and
admiral
fournier
both
indicated
that
they
believed
in
the
submersible
supremacy
in
actual
encounter
with
capital
ships
the
war
so
far
has
shown
that
in
action
between
fleets
the
submersible
has
played
a
negative
part
in
the
jutland
bank
battle
the
submersible
handicapped
in
speed
and
eyesight
took
as
active
a
part
as
a
jack
tar
humorously
put
it
as
a
turtle
might
in
a
cat
fight
not
even
under
the
extraordinary
conditions
of
the
bombardment
in
the
dardanelles
when
the
circumstances
were
such
as
lent
themselves
strikingly
to
submarine
attack
did
these
vessels
score
against
the
fleet
in
action
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
the
submersible
did
not
take
a
vital
part
in
any
of
the
major
naval
actions
in
the
naval
battle
of
we
have
a
number
of
very
armored
craft
fighting
against
one
another
over
ranges
extending
up
to
yards
there
is
a
constant
evolution
in
the
position
of
the
ships
which
it
is
impossible
to
follow
from
the
low
point
of
vantage
of
a
periscope
for
the
different
formations
of
ships
mean
nothing
to
the
submersible
commander
he
is
so
placed
that
his
range
of
vision
is
extremely
limited
and
on
account
of
the
low
speed
of
his
boat
while
submerged
he
can
operate
over
only
a
very
limited
area
of
water
while
the
other
vessels
are
moving
many
miles
then
too
he
is
extremely
vulnerable
to
the
effect
of
enemy
shells
and
to
the
ramming
of
enemy
ships
under
these
conditions
the
submersible
commander
is
more
or
less
forced
to
a
policy
of
lying
ambushed
to
surprise
his
enemy
it
is
said
that
the
lusitania
was
decoyed
into
a
nest
of
submersibles
there
was
but
little
chance
of
torpedoing
her
in
any
other
way
there
is
also
the
statement
that
admiral
beatty
passed
with
his
through
a
flotilla
of
enemy
submersibles
without
being
touched
submersibles
can
not
attack
their
target
in
definite
formations
as
do
surface
vessels
and
therefore
they
can
not
operate
in
numbers
with
the
same
effectiveness
as
do
the
latter
they
must
maneuver
more
or
less
singly
and
at
random
being
limited
to
the
torpedo
which
when
they
are
submerged
is
their
sole
weapon
of
attack
they
have
an
uncertain
means
of
striking
their
armed
enemy
the
eccentricities
of
the
automobile
torpedo
are
well
known
but
even
eliminating
the
fact
that
this
missile
is
unreliable
the
important
question
of
accuracy
in
the
estimate
of
range
and
speed
which
the
submersible
commander
has
to
make
before
firing
the
torpedo
must
be
considered
there
is
usually
a
large
percentage
of
error
in
his
calculations
unless
the
submersible
is
extremely
close
to
its
target
realizing
these
limitations
the
german
submersibles
are
equipped
with
small
torpedoes
which
are
generally
fired
at
ranges
not
exceeding
eight
hundred
to
two
thousand
yards
the
necessity
of
approaching
the
target
so
closely
is
of
course
a
tremendous
handicap
in
the
general
operation
of
these
boats
in
view
of
these
facts
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
submersible
should
not
have
been
able
to
sweep
the
capital
ship
from
the
seas
as
was
predicted
by
certain
experts
before
the
war
ii
admiral
sir
cyprian
bridge
regards
the
functions
of
defense
by
a
navy
as
divisible
into
three
main
classifications
he
says
the
three
divisions
are
called
in
common
speech
coast
defense
colonial
defense
and
defense
of
commerce
from
this
classification
we
are
given
a
hint
as
to
what
a
sailor
means
by
naval
supremacy
freedom
of
the
seas
and
other
terms
so
misused
that
they
mean
nothing
coast
defense
means
defense
against
invasion
colonial
defense
means
the
safeguarding
of
distant
possessions
against
enemy
forces
the
defense
of
commerce
means
such
supremacy
on
the
seas
as
will
insure
absolute
safety
of
the
mercantile
marine
from
enemy
every
great
nation
is
waging
a
trade
war
the
industrial
competition
of
peace
is
as
keen
as
the
competition
of
war
all
the
great
powers
realized
years
ago
that
to
gain
and
keep
their
place
in
the
sun
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
construct
navies
that
would
insure
to
them
a
certain
control
of
the
seas
for
the
protection
of
their
commerce
in
this
way
began
the
abnormal
naval
construction
in
which
the
powers
have
vied
with
one
another
for
supremacy
a
simple
way
of
looking
at
the
question
what
constitutes
the
power
of
a
fleet
is
to
consider
the
warship
as
merely
a
floating
even
though
this
floating
platform
is
the
most
complex
piece
of
mechanism
that
was
ever
contrived
by
man
nevertheless
its
general
function
is
simple
the
war
has
given
us
enough
experience
to
convince
us
that
the
backbone
of
a
navy
is
after
all
the
heavily
armored
ship
of
moderately
high
speed
carrying
a
very
heavy
armament
this
floating
is
the
structure
best
fitted
to
carry
large
guns
into
battle
and
to
withstand
the
terrific
punishment
of
the
fire
the
battleship
is
notwithstanding
the
development
of
other
types
queen
of
the
seas
it
is
therefore
not
difficult
to
estimate
the
relative
power
of
the
fleets
of
different
nations
in
fact
a
purely
engineering
estimate
of
this
kind
can
be
made
and
the
respective
ranks
of
the
world
naval
powers
ascertained
germany
has
shown
all
through
the
war
that
she
thoroughly
appreciated
the
british
naval
supremacy
her
fleet
has
ventured
little
more
than
sporadic
operations
from
the
bases
behind
heligoland
it
was
probably
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
and
not
the
expectation
that
she
would
achieve
anything
of
military
advantage
that
forced
her
to
send
her
fleet
into
conflict
with
the
british
squadrons
off
jutland
if
one
should
examine
the
course
of
this
battle
which
has
been
represented
by
lines
graphically
showing
the
paths
of
the
british
and
german
fleets
one
could
easily
see
how
the
british
imposed
their
will
upon
the
germans
in
every
turn
that
these
lines
make
it
reminds
one
very
much
of
the
herding
of
sheep
for
the
german
fleet
was
literally
herded
on
may
from
in
the
afternoon
until
that
night
admiral
von
scheer
however
fought
the
only
action
which
it
was
possible
for
him
to
fight
it
was
a
losing
action
and
one
which
he
knew
from
a
purely
mathematical
consideration
could
not
be
successful
through
the
very
definiteness
of
this
understanding
of
what
constitutes
naval
strength
great
britain
navy
until
recently
has
remained
a
great
potential
force
becoming
dynamic
for
only
a
few
hours
at
jutland
after
which
it
returned
to
that
mysterious
northern
base
whence
it
seems
to
dominate
the
seas
because
of
the
potentiality
of
these
hidden
warships
thousands
of
vessels
have
traversed
the
ocean
freighted
with
countless
tons
of
cargoes
and
millions
of
men
for
the
allies
even
at
that
psychological
moment
when
the
first
hundred
thousand
were
being
transported
to
france
germany
refrained
from
a
naval
attack
which
might
have
turned
the
whole
land
campaign
in
her
favor
however
the
world
is
awakening
to
a
new
idea
of
to
a
new
conception
that
will
have
a
influence
on
the
future
development
of
naval
machinery
sir
cyprian
bridge
has
stated
that
one
of
the
functions
of
a
fleet
is
the
defense
of
commerce
there
is
no
more
important
function
for
a
fleet
than
this
a
nation
may
be
subjugated
by
direct
invasion
or
it
may
be
isolated
from
the
world
by
blockade
if
the
blockade
be
sufficiently
long
and
effectively
maintained
it
will
ruin
the
nation
as
effectually
as
direct
invasion
thus
in
the
maintenance
of
a
nation
merchant
marine
on
the
high
seas
its
navy
exercises
one
of
its
most
vital
functions
there
can
therefore
be
no
naval
supremacy
for
a
nation
unless
its
commerce
is
assured
of
immunity
from
considerable
losses
through
the
attack
of
its
enemy
it
is
idle
for
us
to
speak
of
our
naval
supremacy
over
germany
when
our
navies
are
failing
in
one
of
their
most
important
functions
and
when
our
commerce
is
suffering
such
serious
losses
the
persons
best
qualified
to
judge
are
those
who
are
most
anxious
regarding
the
present
losses
in
mercantile
tonnage
while
it
has
been
shown
that
the
submersible
of
as
a
fighting
machine
is
considerably
limited
and
in
no
sense
endangers
the
existence
of
the
capital
ship
nevertheless
in
the
new
huge
submersible
it
seems
that
the
ideal
has
been
found
this
vessel
possesses
the
necessary
cruising
radius
to
operate
over
sufficient
distances
to
control
important
routes
it
makes
a
surface
speed
great
enough
to
run
down
cargo
steamers
and
has
a
superstructure
to
mount
guns
of
considerable
power
up
to
it
embodies
almost
all
the
qualifications
of
the
light
surface
cruiser
with
the
additional
tremendous
advantage
of
being
able
to
hide
by
submergence
to
be
completely
successful
it
must
operate
in
flotillas
of
hundreds
in
waters
that
are
opaque
to
aërial
observation
germany
has
but
a
limited
number
of
these
submersibles
otherwise
she
would
be
able
to
crush
the
allied
commerce
the
ideal
submersible
should
be
a
vessel
of
such
displacement
that
she
could
carry
a
sufficient
number
of
large
guns
in
her
superstructure
to
enable
her
to
fight
off
the
attack
of
surface
destroyers
and
the
smaller
patrol
craft
she
should
be
capable
of
cruising
over
a
large
radius
at
high
speed
both
on
the
surface
and
submerged
the
supersubmersible
flotillas
should
comprise
fifty
or
sixty
of
these
units
the
attack
on
the
trade
routes
should
be
made
by
a
number
of
flotillas
operating
at
different
points
at
unexpected
times
germany
has
concentrated
her
submarine
war
particularly
in
the
constricted
waters
about
england
it
is
here
that
the
shipping
is
most
congested
and
therefore
the
harvest
is
richest
but
it
is
also
easier
to
protect
the
trade
routes
over
these
limited
areas
of
water
by
patrols
nets
than
it
would
be
to
protect
the
entire
length
of
the
steamship
lanes
if
the
submersible
were
capable
of
dealing
directly
with
the
destroyer
in
a
tremendous
revolution
would
take
place
in
the
tactics
of
submarine
swatting
then
it
would
be
difficult
to
see
how
the
submersible
could
be
dealt
with
improvement
in
motive
machinery
is
the
vital
necessity
in
the
development
of
the
submersible
the
next
few
years
may
see
unexpected
strides
taken
in
this
direction
a
great
deal
will
also
be
accomplished
in
perfecting
methods
of
receiving
sounds
under
water
particularly
in
relation
to
ascertaining
the
direction
of
these
sounds
when
this
is
done
it
will
be
possible
for
the
submersible
commander
to
tell
a
great
deal
about
the
positions
of
the
vessels
above
him
and
thus
his
artificial
ears
will
compensate
to
a
great
extent
for
his
blindness
by
the
addition
of
a
greater
number
of
and
the
improvement
of
their
centralized
control
in
the
hand
of
the
commander
at
the
periscope
along
lines
which
we
are
now
developing
it
will
be
possible
for
the
submersible
to
achieve
a
greater
effectiveness
in
its
torpedo
fire
probably
torpedoes
will
then
be
used
only
against
the
more
important
enemy
units
such
as
battleships
cruisers
and
the
like
to
be
certain
of
striking
these
valuable
targets
would
be
worth
expending
a
number
of
torpedoes
in
salvo
fire
whether
the
german
campaign
succeeds
or
not
will
be
largely
a
question
of
the
number
of
submersibles
that
the
central
powers
can
put
into
service
and
to
what
extent
the
submersible
will
be
developed
during
the
present
war
iii
german
submarines
have
sunk
over
tons
of
the
allied
shipping
in
december
it
was
stated
in
the
british
parliament
that
the
merchant
marine
of
great
britain
had
at
that
time
over
tons
within
the
first
three
months
of
the
unrestricted
submarine
warfare
tons
of
british
shipping
went
to
the
bottom
at
this
rate
england
would
lose
per
cent
of
her
merchant
marine
per
annum
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
attention
of
the
entire
world
is
concentrated
upon
the
vital
problem
of
the
submarine
menace
on
land
the
central
powers
are
still
holding
their
ground
but
there
is
a
continuous
increase
of
the
forces
of
the
allies
which
should
lead
finally
to
such
a
preponderance
of
power
as
will
overwhelm
the
forces
opposed
to
them
the
allied
armies
however
depend
for
their
sustenance
and
supplies
upon
the
freedom
of
the
seas
the
trade
routes
of
the
world
constitute
the
arteries
which
feed
the
muscles
of
these
armies
germany
is
endeavoring
to
cut
these
arteries
by
the
submarine
should
she
even
appreciably
limit
the
supplies
that
cross
the
ocean
to
the
allies
she
will
bring
about
a
condition
that
will
make
it
impossible
to
augment
their
armies
in
this
way
there
will
inevitably
be
a
deadlock
which
from
the
german
standpoint
would
be
a
highly
desirable
consummation
obviously
the
first
method
of
handling
the
submarine
problem
would
be
to
bottle
the
german
undersea
craft
in
their
bases
there
has
been
a
number
of
proposals
as
to
how
best
to
accomplish
this
it
has
been
stated
that
the
english
navy
has
planted
mines
in
channels
leading
from
zeebrugge
and
other
submarine
bases
but
it
is
necessary
only
to
recall
the
exploits
of
the
and
the
of
the
british
navy
at
the
dardanelles
to
see
that
it
would
not
be
impossible
for
the
germans
to
pass
in
their
through
these
into
the
open
sea
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
and
the
passed
through
five
or
more
thence
through
the
dardanelles
into
the
sea
of
marmora
and
even
into
the
bosphorus
under
seemingly
impossible
conditions
yet
in
spite
of
the
tremendous
risks
that
they
ran
these
boats
continued
their
operations
for
some
time
passing
up
as
far
as
constantinople
actually
shelling
the
city
sinking
transports
and
accomplishing
other
feats
which
have
been
graphically
described
in
the
stories
of
rudyard
kipling
and
again
if
the
were
placed
in
close
proximity
to
their
bases
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
for
german
submersibles
of
the
lake
type
possessing
appliances
to
enable
divers
to
pass
outboard
when
the
vessel
is
submerged
to
go
out
and
cut
away
the
mines
and
thus
render
them
ineffective
nets
are
also
used
to
hinder
the
outward
passage
of
the
submarine
these
nets
can
likewise
be
attacked
and
easily
cut
by
devices
with
which
modern
are
equipped
the
problem
of
placing
these
obstacles
is
a
difficult
one
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
ships
so
engaged
are
harassed
by
german
destroyers
and
other
enemy
craft
outside
of
zeebrugge
shallow
water
extends
to
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
from
the
coast
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
a
large
number
of
aircraft
carrying
bombs
and
torpedoes
should
be
used
to
patrol
systematically
the
channel
leading
from
that
port
to
deep
water
with
the
intent
of
attacking
the
submersibles
as
they
emerge
from
this
base
it
is
ridiculous
to
suppose
that
the
germans
would
not
be
able
to
concentrate
an
equally
large
number
of
aircraft
to
be
supported
also
by
guns
on
the
decks
of
destroyers
and
by
the
coast
defenses
we
have
not
yet
won
the
supremacy
of
the
air
and
it
must
inevitably
be
misleading
to
base
any
proposition
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
masters
of
that
element
the
problem
of
bottling
up
the
submersibles
is
enormously
difficult
because
it
necessitates
operations
in
the
enemy
territory
where
he
would
possess
the
superiority
of
power
i
believe
that
the
question
of
operations
against
the
submarine
bases
is
not
a
naval
but
a
military
one
and
one
which
would
be
best
solved
by
the
advance
of
the
western
left
flank
of
the
allied
armies
the
second
method
is
to
attack
the
submarines
with
every
appliance
that
science
can
produce
in
order
to
attack
the
submarine
directly
with
any
weapon
it
is
necessary
first
to
locate
it
this
is
a
problem
presenting
the
greatest
difficulty
for
it
is
by
their
elusiveness
that
the
submarines
have
gained
such
importance
in
their
war
on
trade
they
attack
the
more
or
less
helpless
merchant
ships
and
vanish
before
the
armed
patrols
appear
on
the
scene
almost
every
suitable
appliance
known
to
physics
has
been
proposed
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
submarine
location
and
detection
as
the
submarine
is
a
huge
vessel
built
of
metal
it
might
be
supposed
that
such
a
contrivance
as
the
hughes
induction
balance
might
be
employed
to
locate
it
the
hughes
balance
is
a
device
which
is
extremely
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
minute
metallic
masses
in
relatively
close
proximity
to
certain
parts
of
the
apparatus
unfortunately
on
account
of
the
presence
of
the
saline
the
submersible
is
practically
shielded
by
a
conducting
medium
in
which
are
set
up
eddy
currents
although
the
may
lack
somewhat
in
conductivity
it
compensates
for
this
by
its
volume
for
this
reason
the
induction
balance
has
proved
a
failure
but
another
method
of
detecting
the
position
of
a
metallic
mass
is
by
the
use
of
the
magnetometer
this
device
operates
on
the
principle
of
magnetic
attraction
and
in
laboratories
on
stable
foundations
it
is
extremely
sensitive
but
the
instability
of
the
ship
on
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
carry
this
instrument
would
render
it
impossible
to
obtain
a
sufficient
degree
of
sensitiveness
in
the
apparatus
to
give
it
any
value
the
fact
that
the
submersible
is
propelled
under
water
by
powerful
electric
motors
begets
the
idea
that
the
electrical
disturbances
therein
might
be
detected
by
highly
sensitive
detectors
of
feeble
electrical
oscillations
the
in
this
case
will
be
found
to
absorb
to
a
tremendous
extent
the
effects
of
the
electrical
disturbance
moreover
the
metallic
hull
of
the
submersible
forms
in
itself
an
almost
ideal
shield
to
screen
the
outgoing
effect
of
these
motors
considerable
and
important
development
has
been
made
in
the
creation
of
sensitive
devices
to
hear
the
propeller
vibrations
and
the
mechanical
vibrations
that
are
present
in
a
submersible
both
of
which
are
transmitted
through
the
water
there
are
three
principal
obstacles
to
the
successful
use
of
such
a
device
when
the
submersible
is
submerged
she
employs
rotary
and
not
reciprocating
being
in
consequence
relatively
quiet
when
running
under
water
and
inaudible
at
any
considerable
distance
the
noises
of
the
vessel
carrying
the
listening
devices
are
difficult
to
exclude
as
are
also
the
noises
of
the
sea
which
are
multitudinous
finally
the
instruments
are
not
highly
directive
hence
are
not
of
great
assistance
in
determining
the
position
of
the
object
from
which
they
are
receiving
sounds
to
locate
the
submersible
aërial
observation
has
been
found
useful
it
is
particularly
so
when
the
waters
are
clear
enough
to
observe
the
vessel
when
submerged
to
some
depth
but
its
value
is
less
than
might
be
supposed
in
the
waters
about
the
british
isles
and
northern
europe
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
matter
in
suspension
which
makes
the
sea
unusually
opaque
the
submersible
however
when
running
along
the
surface
with
only
its
periscope
showing
is
more
easily
detected
by
aircraft
than
by
a
surface
vessel
behind
the
periscope
there
is
a
characteristic
small
wake
which
is
distinguishable
from
above
but
practically
invisible
from
a
low
level
of
observation
many
are
operating
on
the
other
side
for
the
purpose
of
locating
enemy
submersibles
and
reporting
their
presence
to
the
surface
patrol
craft
in
order
to
overcome
the
disadvantages
of
creating
the
periscope
wake
which
i
have
mentioned
it
is
reported
that
the
germans
have
developed
special
means
to
allow
the
when
raiding
to
submerge
to
a
fixed
depth
without
moving
to
maintain
any
body
in
a
fluid
medium
in
a
static
position
is
a
difficult
matter
as
is
shown
in
the
instability
of
aircraft
one
of
the
great
problems
of
the
submersible
has
been
to
master
the
difficulties
of
its
control
while
maintaining
a
desired
depth
the
modern
submersible
usually
forces
itself
under
water
while
still
in
a
slightly
buoyant
condition
by
its
propellers
and
by
the
action
of
two
sets
of
rudders
or
hydroplanes
which
are
arranged
along
its
superstructure
and
which
tend
to
force
it
below
the
surface
when
they
are
given
a
certain
inclination
but
should
the
engines
stop
the
diving
rudders
or
hydroplanes
would
become
ineffective
and
because
of
the
reserve
buoyancy
in
the
hull
the
vessel
would
come
to
the
surface
in
order
to
maintain
the
vessel
in
a
state
of
suspension
under
water
without
moving
it
would
be
necessary
to
hold
an
extremely
delicate
balance
between
the
weight
of
the
submarine
and
that
of
the
water
which
it
displaces
variations
in
weights
are
so
important
to
the
submersible
that
as
fuel
is
used
water
is
allowed
to
enter
certain
tanks
to
compensate
exactly
for
the
loss
of
the
weight
of
the
fuel
to
obtain
such
an
equilibrium
an
automatic
device
controlled
by
the
pressure
of
the
water
which
of
course
varies
with
the
depth
is
used
this
device
controls
the
pumps
which
fill
or
empty
the
so
as
to
keep
the
relation
of
the
submersible
to
the
water
which
it
displaces
constant
under
which
condition
the
vessel
maintains
a
fixed
depth
the
principle
of
this
mechanism
is
of
course
old
and
was
first
embodied
in
the
whitehead
torpedo
which
has
a
device
that
can
be
set
so
as
to
maintain
the
depth
at
which
it
will
run
practically
constant
with
the
addition
of
a
telescopic
periscope
which
can
be
shortened
or
extended
at
will
it
will
be
possible
for
the
to
lie
motionless
with
only
the
minute
surface
of
the
periscope
revealing
her
position
iv
to
attack
the
submersible
is
a
matter
of
opportunity
it
is
only
when
one
is
caught
operating
on
the
surface
or
is
forced
to
the
surface
by
becoming
entangled
in
nets
that
the
patrol
has
the
chance
to
fire
upon
it
against
this
method
of
attack
modern
submersibles
have
been
improving
their
defenses
they
are
shielded
with
armor
of
some
weight
on
the
superstructure
and
over
part
of
the
hull
they
are
also
equipped
with
guns
up
to
five
inches
in
diameter
and
affording
as
they
do
a
fairly
steady
base
they
can
outmatch
in
any
of
the
lighter
patrol
boats
which
they
may
encounter
one
of
the
important
improvements
which
have
been
made
has
resulted
in
the
increased
speed
with
which
they
now
submerge
from
the
condition
of
surface
trim
a
submersible
of
a
thousand
tons
displacement
will
carry
about
five
hundred
tons
of
water
ballast
the
problem
of
submerging
is
mainly
that
of
being
able
rapidly
to
fill
the
tanks
on
account
of
the
necessity
of
dealing
with
large
quantities
of
water
in
the
ballast
system
the
european
submersibles
are
equipped
with
pumps
which
can
handle
eight
tons
of
water
per
minute
again
the
speed
which
the
electrical
propulsion
system
gives
the
vessel
on
the
surface
greatly
increases
the
pressure
which
the
diving
rudders
can
exert
in
forcing
the
submersible
under
water
this
effect
may
be
so
marked
that
it
becomes
excessive
and
sueter
emphasizes
the
point
that
vessels
at
high
speed
when
moving
under
water
may
on
account
of
the
momentum
attained
submerge
to
excessive
depths
to
eliminate
this
tendency
there
is
a
hydrostatic
safety
system
which
automatically
causes
the
discharge
of
water
from
the
when
dangerous
pressures
are
reached
thus
bringing
the
submersible
to
a
higher
level
where
the
pressure
on
the
hull
will
not
be
so
severe
from
this
it
follows
that
the
opportunity
of
ramming
a
submersible
or
of
sinking
it
by
gunfire
is
greatly
minimized
since
the
vessel
can
disappear
so
rapidly
illustration
from
underwood
underwood
interior
of
a
submarine
a
great
deal
has
been
attempted
with
nets
fixed
nets
extend
across
many
of
the
bodies
of
water
around
the
british
isles
their
positions
doubtless
are
now
very
well
known
to
the
germans
the
problem
of
cutting
through
them
is
not
a
difficult
one
moreover
the
hull
of
the
submersible
has
been
modified
so
that
the
propellers
are
almost
entirely
shielded
and
incased
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
not
foul
the
lines
of
a
net
there
has
also
been
a
steel
hawser
strung
from
the
bow
across
the
highest
point
of
the
vessel
to
the
stern
so
that
the
submersible
can
underrun
a
net
without
entangling
the
superstructure
some
nets
are
towed
by
surface
vessels
the
process
is
necessarily
slow
and
to
be
effective
the
surface
vessel
must
know
the
exact
location
of
the
submersible
towing
torpedoes
or
high
explosive
charges
behind
moving
vessels
has
been
developed
by
the
italian
navy
but
the
chances
of
hitting
a
submersible
with
such
devices
are
not
very
great
from
aëroplanes
can
be
practiced
successfully
under
exceptional
conditions
only
in
view
of
the
fact
that
such
is
exceedingly
inaccurate
and
that
the
charges
carried
are
relatively
small
this
form
of
attack
ordinarily
would
not
be
very
dangerous
for
the
submersible
surface
craft
have
also
employed
large
charges
of
high
explosives
which
are
caused
to
detonate
by
hydrostatic
pistons
upon
reaching
a
certain
depth
patrol
boats
carry
such
charges
in
order
to
overrun
the
submersible
drop
the
charges
in
its
vicinity
and
by
the
pressure
of
the
underwater
explosion
crush
its
hull
since
the
pressure
of
an
underwater
explosion
diminishes
rapidly
as
the
distance
increases
from
the
point
of
detonation
it
would
be
necessary
to
place
the
explosive
charge
fairly
close
to
the
hull
of
the
submersible
to
be
certain
of
its
destruction
to
accomplish
this
it
would
seem
that
the
ideal
combination
would
be
the
control
of
an
explosive
carrier
by
radio
energy
directly
from
an
aëroplane
thus
we
would
have
a
large
explosive
charge
under
water
where
it
can
most
effectively
injure
the
submersible
controlled
by
the
guidance
of
an
observer
in
the
position
best
suited
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
submerged
target
the
third
method
by
which
to
frustrate
the
attack
of
the
submersible
is
to
give
better
protection
to
the
merchant
marine
itself
while
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
is
being
concentrated
on
the
problem
of
thwarting
the
submersible
but
little
common
sense
has
been
used
while
endeavoring
to
devise
intricate
and
ingenious
mechanisms
to
sink
the
submersible
we
overlook
the
simplest
safeguards
for
our
merchant
vessels
the
construction
of
the
average
ship
is
designed
to
conform
to
the
insurance
requirements
this
does
not
mean
in
any
way
that
the
ship
is
so
constructed
as
to
be
truly
safe
thousands
of
vessels
that
are
plying
the
seas
are
equipped
with
bulkheads
that
are
absolutely
useless
because
they
do
not
extend
high
enough
to
prevent
the
water
from
running
from
one
part
of
the
ship
to
another
when
the
ship
is
partially
submerged
then
again
the
pumping
system
is
so
arranged
as
to
reach
the
water
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
when
the
ship
is
up
by
the
head
should
the
ship
be
injured
in
the
forward
part
and
sink
by
the
head
these
pumps
would
be
unable
to
reach
the
incoming
water
before
her
condition
had
become
desperate
there
is
a
vessel
operating
from
new
york
worth
approximately
a
million
dollars
and
if
she
were
equipped
with
suitable
pumps
which
would
cost
about
a
thousand
dollars
her
safety
would
be
increased
about
forty
per
cent
her
owners
however
prefer
running
the
risk
of
losing
her
to
expending
a
thousand
dollars
if
the
merchant
vessels
were
made
more
it
would
be
an
important
discouragement
to
the
commander
during
the
past
two
years
of
the
war
nineteen
battleships
have
been
torpedoed
and
out
of
this
number
only
three
have
been
sunk
showing
that
it
is
possible
by
proper
construction
to
improve
the
hull
of
a
ship
to
such
an
extent
that
it
is
almost
while
it
may
not
be
practicable
on
account
of
the
cost
to
build
merchant
vessels
along
the
lines
of
armed
ships
nevertheless
much
could
be
done
to
improve
their
structural
strength
and
safety
and
since
speed
is
an
essential
factor
in
circumventing
torpedo
attack
new
should
be
constructed
to
be
as
fast
as
is
feasible
so
radically
have
conditions
changed
that
we
have
a
superabundance
of
useless
dreadnaught
power
the
smaller
guns
of
some
of
these
vessels
and
their
gun
crews
would
be
far
more
useful
on
the
merchant
vessels
than
awaiting
the
day
when
the
german
fleet
shall
venture
forth
again
the
submersible
must
be
driven
below
the
surface
by
a
superiority
of
gunfire
on
the
part
of
the
merchant
marine
and
its
patrols
in
this
way
the
submersible
would
be
dependent
upon
the
torpedo
alone
a
weapon
of
distinct
limitations
in
order
to
use
it
effectively
the
submersible
must
be
not
more
than
from
eight
hundred
to
two
thousand
yards
from
its
target
and
must
run
submerged
at
reduced
speed
thus
greatly
lessening
its
potentiality
for
destruction
submersibles
are
actually
running
down
and
destroying
merchant
vessels
by
gunfire
if
merchant
vessels
carried
two
patrol
launches
equipped
with
guns
of
the
davis
type
and
these
vessels
were
lowered
in
the
danger
zone
as
a
convoy
to
the
ship
such
a
scheme
would
greatly
lessen
the
enormous
task
of
the
present
patrol
in
the
event
of
gunfire
attack
by
a
submersible
three
vessels
would
be
on
the
alert
to
answer
her
fire
instead
of
one
an
important
factor
in
discouraging
submersibles
from
surface
attack
the
future
of
the
submarine
campaign
is
of
vital
importance
the
prospect
is
not
very
cheerful
laubeuf
states
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
germany
had
not
over
submersibles
this
statement
may
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
the
germans
do
not
advertise
what
they
have
it
is
probable
however
that
they
have
not
more
than
two
hundred
submersibles
in
operation
over
four
thousand
patrol
boats
are
operating
against
this
relatively
small
number
and
yet
sinkings
continue
at
an
alarming
rate
it
is
estimated
that
germany
will
be
able
to
produce
a
thousand
submersibles
in
the
coming
year
and
man
these
vessels
with
crews
from
her
blockaded
ships
this
will
be
a
tremendous
addition
to
the
number
she
has
now
in
operation
the
greater
the
number
of
submersibles
she
has
in
action
the
greater
the
area
the
submarine
campaign
will
cover
the
number
of
patrol
vessels
will
have
to
be
increased
in
direct
proportion
to
the
area
of
the
submarine
zone
since
a
large
number
of
patrol
boats
has
to
operate
against
each
submersible
it
will
be
seen
that
a
tremendous
fleet
will
have
to
be
placed
in
commission
to
offset
a
thousand
submersibles
thus
the
problem
becomes
increasingly
difficult
and
the
protection
of
the
trade
route
will
be
no
more
thoroughly
effected
than
it
is
unless
we
overwhelm
the
enemy
by
a
tremendous
fleet
of
destroyers

and
it

appear
that
the
principle
of
is
the
most
hopeful
one
for
us
to
follow
the
journal
of
submarine
commander
von
forstner
i
ordered
to
command
a
submarine
every
year
about
the
first
of
october
at
the
time
of
the
great
army
maneuvers
new
appointments
are
also
made
in
the
navy
but
unlike
our
army
brothers
who
from
beginning
to
end
remain
permanently
either
in
the
artillery
cavalry
or
infantry
we
officers
of
the
navy
are
shifted
from
cruiser
to
torpedo
boat
from
the
ship
of
the
line
to
the
hated
office
desk
on
land
at
the
admiralty
in
order
to
fit
us
to
serve
our
almighty
war
lord
in
every
capacity
and
to
the
best
advantage
the
commander
of
a
torpedo
boat
must
be
familiar
with
the
service
on
board
a
dreadnaught
or
on
any
other
large
ship
for
only
those
who
are
intimately
acquainted
with
the
kind
of
ship
they
are
going
to
attack
possess
sufficient
skill
to
destroy
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
autumn
of
some
of
us
were
surprised
at
the
announcement
ordered
on
board
a
submarine
this
order
naturally
met
with
an
immediate
response
but
it
brought
a
new
outlook
on
the
possibilities
of
our
career
for
we
had
not
yet
been
trained
to
this
branch
of
the
service
which
our
almighty
war
lord
had
only
recently
added
to
the
imperial
navy
the
question
was
should
we
be
able
to
perform
this
new
duty
it
is
well
known
that
the
french
were
the
first
to
complete
a
type
of
submarine
navigable
underseas
and
the
english
unwillingly
but
with
a
sly
anticipation
of
coming
events
copied
this
type
of
boat
to
all
outward
appearance
we
kept
aloof
from
following
the
example
of
our
neighbors
and
our
chiefs
of
the
admiralty
were
beset
with
expostulations
on
the
subject
but
they
were
silently
biding
their
time
while
our
enemies
of
were
bragging
about
their
successful
experiments
with
their
newly
constructed
submarines
to
the
dismay
and
astonishment
of
our
opponents
it
was
only
when
the
right
hour
had
struck
that
our
navy
revealed
that
it
had
similar
weapons
at
its
command
it
therefore
prepared
for
them
some
disagreeable
surprises
and
set
its
special
seal
from
the
very
beginning
on
the
maritime
warfare
i
remember
a
talk
i
had
with
an
old
army
officer
a
few
years
ago
when
i
had
just
received
my
appointment
to
a
submarine
we
were
speaking
of
and
aëroplanes
and
he
exclaimed
ach
my
dear
forstner
give
it
up
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
is
for
fishes
and
the
sky
is
for
birds
what
would
have
happened
to
us
in
this
war
had
we
not
so
proudly
excelled
above
the
earth
and
beneath
the
sea
at
first
a
mystery
still
veiled
our
knowledge
concerning
our
submarines
we
were
told
that
the
dear
good
old
no
had
splendidly
stood
every
test
and
shortly
after
in
october
i
went
on
board
and
had
the
honor
later
to
command
her
for
two
years
but
during
this
period
for
several
years
the
greatest
secrecy
surrounded
this
new
weapon
of
our
navy
strictest
orders
were
given
to
admit
no
one
on
board
not
even
high
officers
only
admirals
were
allowed
to
penetrate
within
and
on
every
matter
concerning
our
we
had
to
maintain
absolute
silence
now
however
that
our
usefulness
has
been
so
fully
justified
the
veil
of
discretion
can
be
somewhat
lifted
and
i
can
describe
within
certain
limits
the
life
and
activities
on
board
a
submarine
ii
breathing
and
living
conditions
under
water
a
submarine
conceals
within
its
small
compass
the
most
concentrated
technical
disposition
known
in
the
art
of
mechanical
construction
especially
so
in
the
spaces
reserved
for
the
steering
gear
of
the
boat
and
for
the
manipulation
of
its
weapons
the
life
on
board
becomes
such
a
matter
of
habit
that
we
can
peacefully
sleep
at
great
depths
under
the
sea
while
the
noise
is
distinctly
heard
of
the
propellers
of
the
enemy
ships
hunting
for
us
overhead
for
water
is
an
excellent
sound
conductor
and
conveys
from
a
long
distance
the
approach
of
a
steamer
we
are
often
asked
how
can
you
breathe
under
water
the
health
of
our
crew
is
the
best
proof
that
this
is
fully
possible
we
possessed
as
fellow
passengers
a
dozen
guinea
pigs
the
gift
of
a
kindly
and
anxious
friend
who
had
been
told
these
little
creatures
were
very
sensitive
to
the
ill
effects
of
a
vitiated
atmosphere
they
flourished
in
our
midst
and
proved
amusing
companions
it
is
essential
before
a
submerges
to
drive
out
the
exhausted
air
through
powerful
ventilating
machines
and
to
suck
in
the
purest
air
obtainable
but
often
in
war
time
one
is
obliged
to
dive
with
the
emanations
of
cooking
machine
oil
and
the
breath
of
the
crew
still
permeating
the
atmosphere
for
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
success
of
a
submarine
attack
that
the
enemy
should
not
detect
our
presence
therefore
it
is
impossible
at
such
short
notice
to
clear
the
air
within
the
boat
these
conditions
however
are
bearable
although
one
must
be
constantly
on
the
watch
to
supply
in
time
fresh
ventilation
notwithstanding
certain
assertions
in
the
press
of
alleged
discoveries
to
supply
new
sources
of
air
the
actual
amount
remains
unchanged
from
the
moment
of
submersion
and
there
is
no
possibility
either
through
ventilators
or
any
other
device
so
far
known
in
construction
to
draw
in
fresh
air
under
water
this
air
however
can
be
purified
from
the
carbonic
acid
gas
exhalations
by
releasing
the
necessary
proportion
of
oxygen
if
the
carbonic
acid
gas
increases
in
excess
proportion
then
it
produces
symptoms
in
a
different
degree
in
different
individuals
such
as
extreme
fatigue
and
violent
headaches
under
such
conditions
the
crew
would
be
unable
to
perform
the
strenuous
maneuver
demanded
of
it
and
the
carbonic
acid
must
be
withdrawn
and
oxygen
admitted
the
ventilation
system
of
the
entire
submarine
is
connected
with
certain
chemicals
through
which
the
air
circulates
whose
property
is
to
absorb
and
retain
the
carbonic
acid
preparations
of
potassium
are
usually
employed
for
this
purpose
simultaneously
cylinders
of
oxygen
under
fairly
high
pressure
spray
oxygen
into
the
ventilation
system
which
is
released
in
a
measure
proportionate
to
the
number
of
the
crew
there
is
a
meter
in
the
distributing
section
of
the
oxygen
tubes
which
is
set
to
act
automatically
at
a
certain
ratio
per
man
the
ordinary
atmosphere
is
bearable
for
a
long
time
and
this
costly
method
of
cleansing
the
air
is
used
only
as
a
last
resort
the
moment
at
which
it
must
be
employed
is
closely
calculated
to
correspond
not
only
with
the
atmospheric
conditions
at
the
time
of
submersion
but
also
to
the
cubic
quantity
of
air
apportioned
to
each
man
according
to
his
activities
and
according
to
the
size
of
the
boat
it
is
unnecessary
to
clear
the
air
artificially
during
a
short
submersion
but
during
prolonged
ones
it
is
advisable
to
begin
doing
so
at
an
early
hour
to
prevent
the
carbonic
acid
gas
from
gaining
a
disproportionate
percentage
as
it
becomes
then
more
difficult
to
control
and
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
impossible
to
dissipate
the
fumes
of
cooking
the
odors
of
the
machine
oil
and
the
breath
of
the
crew
taken
altogether
one
can
live
comfortably
underseas
although
there
is
a
certain
discomfort
from
the
warmth
produced
by
the
working
of
the
electrical
machinery
and
from
the
condensation
created
by
the
high
temperature
on
the
surface
of
the
boat
plunged
in
cold
water
which
is
more
noticeable
in
winter
and
in
colder
regions
it
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
occupations
of
the
crew
determine
the
atmospheric
conditions
the
quantity
of
air
required
by
a
human
body
depends
entirely
on
its
activity
a
man
working
hard
absorbs
in
an
hour
liters
of
air
besides
the
commander
who
is
vigorously
engaged
in
the
turret
as
will
be
hereafter
described
the
men
employed
on
the
lateral
and
depth
steering
and
those
handling
the
torpedo
tubes
are
doing
hard
physical
work
the
inactive
men
use
up
a
far
smaller
quantity
of
air
and
it
is
ascertained
that
a
man
asleep
requires
hourly
only
fifteen
liters
of
air
a
crew
off
duty
is
therefore
expected
to
sleep
at
once
undisturbed
by
the
noise
around
them
and
their
efficiency
is
all
the
greater
when
the
time
comes
to
relieve
their
weary
comrades
we
had
a
wireless
operator
on
board
whose
duties
ceased
after
submersion
and
he
had
so
well
perfected
the
art
of
sleeping
that
he
never
cost
us
more
than
fifteen
liters
of
air
hourly
underseas
the
length
of
time
that
a
can
remain
under
water
depends
as
we
stated
above
on
the
atmospheric
conditions
at
the
moment
of
plunging
and
on
the
amount
of
oxygen
and
chemicals
taken
on
board
we
can
stay
submerged
for
several
days
and
a
longer
period
will
probably
never
be
necessary
the
distance
of
vision
varies
somewhat
under
water
as
we
look
out
from
the
side
windows
cut
into
the
steel
armor
of
the
conning
tower
we
can
naturally
see
farther
in
the
clear
water
of
the
deep
ocean
than
in
the
turbid
dirty
water
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
and
the
surface
of
the
has
a
direct
influence
on
the
sight
which
is
far
more
distinct
over
a
light
sand
than
over
dark
seaweed
or
black
rocks
and
at
an
upper
level
the
sunshine
is
noticeable
many
meters
under
water
but
in
any
case
the
vision
underseas
is
of
the
shortest
and
does
not
extend
beyond
a
few
meters
light
objects
and
even
the
stem
and
stern
of
our
own
boat
are
invisible
from
the
turret
we
are
unaware
therefore
of
advancing
ships
derelicts
or
projecting
rocks
and
no
lookout
can
preserve
us
from
these
dangers
the
crew
is
entirely
ignorant
of
their
surroundings
only
the
commander
in
his
turret
surveys
through
the
periscope
now
and
then
a
small
sector
of
the
horizon
and
in
turning
round
the
periscope
he
gradually
perceives
the
entire
horizon
but
this
survey
demands
great
physical
exertion
which
on
a
long
cruise
is
most
fatiguing
the
periscopes
erected
through
the
upper
cover
of
the
turret
must
not
be
too
easily
turned
in
their
sockets
and
the
latter
are
very
tightly
screwed
in
for
otherwise
they
would
not
be
able
to
resist
the
water
pressure
at
a
great
depth
the
effort
of
simply
turning
the
periscope
is
so
exhausting
that
casual
observations
of
the
horizon
are
made
by
the
officer
of
the
watch
but
during
naval
maneuvers
or
in
time
of
war
the
commander
alone
manipulates
the
periscope
it
is
essential
in
this
case
that
the
periscope
should
not
arise
needlessly
above
water
and
betray
the
presence
of
the
the
commander
must
possess
the
absolute
confidence
of
his
crew
for
their
lives
are
in
his
hands
in
this
small
and
carefully
selected
company
each
man
from
the
commanding
officer
down
to
the
sailor
boy
and
down
to
the
stoker
knows
that
each
one
is
serving
in
his
own
appointed
place
and
they
perform
their
duties
serenely
and
efficiently
i
have
always
allowed
every
man
on
board
once
in
turn
to
have
a
look
through
the
periscope
it
is
their
highest
ambition
and
the
result
is
excellent
for
it
reassures
them
and
they
feel
more
confident
as
to
their
own
safety
after
the
granting
of
this
small
favor
as
we
advance
underseas
unless
passing
through
a
school
of
fish
we
seldom
see
any
fish
for
the
noise
of
the
propellers
frightens
them
away
but
when
we
lie
at
rest
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
electric
lights
allure
them
and
they
come
and
stare
at
us
with
goggling
eyes
close
to
the
windows
in
the
turret
the
life
therefore
in
our
cylinder
as
we
call
it
offers
a
good
deal
of
variety
the
term
cylinder
is
exact
for
the
inner
conformation
of
a
submarine
is
necessarily
rounded
so
that
relatively
thin
partitions
can
successfully
resist
the
greatest
pressure
of
water
iii
submersion
and
torpedo
fire
a
new
passenger
for
the
first
time
in
a
submarine
has
often
professed
to
be
unaware
that
he
was
fathoms
deep
under
water
and
has
been
quite
unconscious
that
the
boat
had
been
diving
of
course
his
astonishment
indicates
that
he
was
not
in
the
compartment
where
these
maneuvers
take
place
for
it
is
in
the
commander
turret
that
the
whole
apparatus
is
centralized
for
submersion
for
steering
to
the
right
depth
and
also
for
emersion
at
this
juncture
every
man
must
be
at
his
post
and
each
one
of
the
thirty
members
of
the
crew
must
feel
individually
responsible
for
the
safety
of
the
whole
in
the
difficult
and
rapid
maneuver
of
plunging
for
the
slightest
mistake
may
endanger
the
security
of
the
boat
the
central
control
situated
in
the
commander
turret
is
in
reality
the
brain
of
the
boat
when
the
alarm
signal
is
heard
to
change
the
course
from
surface
navigation
to
subsurface
navigation
several
previously
designated
members
of
the
crew
take
their
post
of
duty
in
the
commander
turret
the
commander
himself
is
on
duty
during
the
whole
of
the
expedition
in
time
of
war
and
he
seldom
gets
a
chance
for
rest
in
his
tiny
little
cabin
day
and
night
if
there
is
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
he
watches
on
the
exposed
bridge
on
the
top
of
the
turret
for
a
few
seconds
delay
in
submerging
might
forfeit
the
taking
of
a
much
coveted
prize
so
he
learns
to
do
without
sleep
or
to
catch
a
few
brief
seconds
of
repose
by
lying
down
in
his
wet
clothes
and
he
is
at
once
ready
to
respond
to
the
alarm
signal
of
the
officer
of
the
watch
in
one
bound
he
is
once
more
surveying
the
horizon
through
the
periscope
or
mounts
to
the
bridge
to
determine
with
his
powerful
field
glass
whether
friend
or
foe
is
in
sight
his
observations
must
be
taken
in
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
for
the
enemy
is
also
constantly
on
the
lookout
and
continual
practice
enables
the
sailor
in
the
crow
nest
to
detect
the
slender
stem
of
a
periscope
although
the
hull
of
the
boat
is
scarcely
visible
on
the
face
of
the
waters
the
commander
must
come
to
a
prompt
decision
as
soon
as
he
locates
the
adversary
exact
position
not
only
may
a
retarded
submersion
spoil
our
plan
of
attack
but
we
are
exposed
to
being
rammed
by
a
rapidly
advancing
steamer
our
haste
must
be
all
the
greater
if
the
conditions
of
visibility
are
impaired
as
is
often
the
case
on
the
high
seas
for
it
takes
time
for
the
to
submerge
completely
and
during
this
process
it
is
helplessly
exposed
to
the
fire
of
long
distance
guns
calmly
but
with
great
decision
the
commander
gives
the
general
orders
to
submerge
the
internal
combustion
engines
the
oil
motors
which
during
surface
navigation
are
used
to
accelerate
the
speed
of
the
boat
are
immediately
disconnected
as
they
consume
too
much
air
underseas
and
electric
motors
are
now
quickly
attached
and
set
in
motion
they
are
supplied
by
a
large
storage
battery
which
consumes
no
air
and
forms
the
motive
power
during
subsurface
navigation
of
course
electricity
might
be
employed
above
water
but
it
uses
up
much
current
which
is
far
more
expensive
than
oil
and
would
be
wasted
too
rapidly
if
not
economized
with
care
it
would
be
convenient
to
employ
the
same
oil
motor
for
underseas
navigation
but
such
a
machine
has
not
yet
been
constructed
although
various
futile
attempts
of
this
kind
have
been
made
with
only
one
system
of
propulsion
we
should
gain
much
coveted
space
and
a
more
evenly
distributed
weight
within
the
same
dimensions
new
weapons
of
attack
could
be
inserted
and
also
effective
weapons
of
defense
the
inventor
of
such
a
device
would
earn
a
large
reward
let
him
who
wants
it
try
for
it
quickly
with
deft
hands
the
outboard
connections
which
served
as
exhausts
for
the
oil
motors
must
be
closed
in
such
a
way
as
to
resist
at
once
the
high
water
pressure
it
is
well
known
that
for
every
ten
meters
under
water
we
oppose
the
pressure
of
one
atmosphere
one
kilogram
to
the
square
centimeter
and
we
must
be
prepared
to
dive
to
far
greater
depths
when
all
these
openings
have
been
carefully
closed
and
fastened
then
begins
the
maneuver
of
submersion
the
sea
water
is
admitted
into
big
open
tanks
powerful
suction
engines
in
the
central
control
of
the
boat
draw
out
the
air
from
these
tanks
so
as
to
increase
the
rapid
inrush
of
the
water
the
chief
engineer
notifies
the
captain
as
soon
as
the
tanks
are
sufficiently
filled
and
an
even
weight
is
established
so
as
to
steer
the
boat
to
the
proper
depth
for
attack
notwithstanding
the
noise
of
the
machinery
large
speaking
tubes
facilitate
the
delivery
of
orders
between
the
commander
turret
and
the
central
and
now
is
the
moment
the
commander
gives
the
order
to
submerge
all
this
may
sound
very
simple
and
yet
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
consider
in
the
same
manner
in
which
an
airplane
is
carefully
balanced
before
taking
wing
into
the
high
regions
of
the
sky
a
submarine
must
be
accurately
weighed
and
measured
before
it
descends
into
the
watery
depths
of
the
ocean
the
briny
water
of
the
north
sea
weighs
far
more
than
the
less
salty
water
of
the
baltic
sea
whose
western
basin
is
composed
of
practically
fresh
water
a
boat
floats
higher
in
the
heavily
salted
waters
of
the
north
sea
and
lies
deeper
and
plunges
farther
down
in
the
waters
of
the
baltic
the
same
therefore
must
take
into
its
tanks
a
greater
quantity
of
water
ballast
in
the
north
sea
to
be
properly
weighted
than
when
diving
into
fresher
waters
even
with
small
submarines
of
tons
displacement
there
is
the
enormous
difference
of
tons
between
specific
weight
in
the
intake
of
north
sea
water
and
specific
weight
of
fresh
water
on
the
other
hand
if
too
much
water
is
admitted
into
the
tanks
the
submarine
may
plunge
with
great
velocity
deeper
and
deeper
beyond
its
appointed
depth
and
in
such
a
case
it
might
even
happen
that
the
hull
of
the
boat
could
not
withstand
the
overpowering
pressure
and
would
be
crushed
beneath
the
mass
of
water
and
yet
again
if
too
small
a
quantity
of
water
ballast
is
admitted
into
the
tanks
the
boat
may
not
sink
sufficiently
below
the
surface
and
thus
we
could
not
obtain
an
invisible
attack
which
is
positively
necessary
for
our
success
how
much
water
then
must
we
take
in
the
answer
to
this
question
is
a
matter
of
instinct
education
and
experience
and
we
must
also
depend
on
the
cleverly
devised
apparatus
made
for
this
purpose
the
submarine
like
the
airplane
must
be
always
maintained
at
the
proper
level
the
weight
of
the
boat
varies
continually
during
a
prolonged
voyage
food
is
devoured
and
the
diving
material
of
the
machinery
is
consumed
the
water
in
which
the
boat
swims
continually
changes
weight
and
the
boat
is
imperceptibly
raised
or
lowered
in
a
way
very
difficult
to
ascertain
the
officer
responsible
for
the
flooding
of
the
submarine
must
painstakingly
keep
its
weight
under
control
during
the
entire
navigation
the
weight
of
a
meal
eaten
by
each
man
of
the
crew
the
remains
of
the
food
and
the
boxes
in
which
it
was
contained
which
have
been
thrown
overboard
must
be
calculated
as
well
as
the
weight
of
the
water
and
the
officer
employs
delicate
apparatus
for
these
measurements
on
the
open
seas
these
alterations
in
weight
do
not
occur
very
rapidly
but
whenever
a
boat
approaches
the
mouth
of
a
river
then
the
transition
from
salt
to
fresh
water
happens
very
suddenly
and
may
provoke
the
undesirable
disturbances
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
also
warm
and
cold
currents
at
different
depths
produce
thermotic
conditions
which
surprisingly
change
the
weight
of
the
water
peculiar
as
it
may
appear
a
submarine
must
be
lightened
to
descend
to
a
very
great
depth
whereas
in
steering
to
a
higher
level
more
water
must
be
admitted
into
the
tanks
to
prevent
our
emerging
to
the
surface
with
too
great
suddenness
this
demands
careful
attention
skill
and
experience
the
principal
condition
for
the
success
of
a
submarine
attack
is
to
steer
to
the
exact
depth
required
the
periscope
must
not
rise
too
far
above
water
for
it
might
easily
be
observed
by
the
enemy
but
if
by
clumsy
steering
the
top
of
the
periscope
descends
below
the
waves
then
it
becomes
impossible
to
take
aim
to
fire
the
torpedo
the
commander
therefore
must
be
able
to
depend
on
the
two
men
who
control
the
vertical
and
horizontal
rudders
whom
another
officer
constantly
directs
and
supervises
when
the
boat
has
reached
the
prescribed
depth
a
close
examination
is
made
of
all
the
pipes
to
see
if
they
can
properly
resist
the
water
pressure
if
any
tiny
leak
has
been
sprung
every
cap
must
be
tightly
screwed
down
for
it
is
evident
it
would
be
very
undesirable
if
any
leak
should
occur
and
increase
the
heaviness
of
the
submarine
absolute
silence
must
prevail
so
that
any
dripping
or
greater
influx
in
the
tanks
can
be
observed
quietly
and
silently
the
boat
advances
against
the
enemy
the
only
audible
sounds
are
the
purring
of
the
electric
motors
and
the
unavoidable
noise
made
by
the
manipulation
of
the
vertical
and
horizontal
rudders
alert
and
speechless
every
man
on
board
awaits
a
sign
from
the
commander
who
is
watching
in
the
turret
but
some
time
may
elapse
now
that
the
periscope
is
lowered
and
nearly
on
the
level
of
the
waters
before
the
adversary
becomes
visible
again
the
ship
may
have
changed
her
course
and
have
taken
an
opposite
direction
to
the
one
she
was
following
at
the
moment
we
submerged
in
that
case
she
would
be
out
of
reach
and
all
our
preparations
prove
useless
at
various
intervals
the
commander
presses
an
electric
button
and
raises
and
lowers
the
periscope
as
quickly
as
possible
so
as
to
take
his
own
observation
without
if
possible
being
observed
himself
for
he
knows
that
any
injury
to
the
periscope
his
most
priceless
jewel
would
as
it
were
render
the
boat
blind
and
rob
him
of
the
much
coveted
laurel
leaves
during
these
short
glimpses
the
commander
only
perceives
a
little
sky
and
the
wide
round
plate
of
the
reflected
sea
with
its
dancing
waves
while
the
nervous
tension
of
the
expectant
crew
increases
every
minute
at
last
is
heard
a
joyous
outcry
from
the
commander
the
fellows
are
coming
and
after
one
quick
glance
to
locate
the
enemy
exactly
the
periscope
is
lowered
now
every
heart
beats
with
happy
anticipation
and
every
nerve
quivers
with
excitement
the
captain
quickly
issues
his
orders
for
the
course
to
be
steered
and
for
the
necessary
navigation
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
torpedoes
receives
the
command
to
clear
the
loaded
torpedo
for
firing
while
the
captain
quietly
calculates
first
the
relative
position
of
his
boat
to
the
enemy
ship
according
to
the
course
she
has
taken
secondly
at
which
point
he
must
aim
the
torpedo
to
take
surest
effect
and
in
the
same
way
as
in
hunting
a
hare
he
withholds
the
shot
to
correspond
to
his
victim
gait
many
thoughts
fly
through
his
brain
here
among
his
companions
the
annihilation
of
the
enemy
will
cause
joyful
enthusiasm
while
among
them
their
downfall
will
cause
overwhelming
sorrow
but
without
doubt
they
must
vanish
from
the
seas
and
only
a
man
who
has
experienced
these
sensations
knows
how
many
secondary
matters
occur
to
him
at
such
a
time
with
lowered
periscope
he
sees
nothing
that
goes
on
above
him
on
the
sea
and
like
a
blind
man
the
boat
feels
its
way
through
the
green
flood
every
possible
event
becomes
a
subject
of
conjecture
will
the
fellow
continue
on
the
same
course
has
he
seen
our
periscope
in
the
second
it
was
exposed
and
is
he
running
away
from
us
or
on
the
contrary
having
seen
us
will
he
put
on
full
steam
and
try
to
run
us
down
with
a
fatal
death
stroke
from
his
prow
at
such
an
instant
of
high
nervous
tension
i
have
caught
myself
giving
superfluous
orders
to
let
myself
relax
and
yet
i
knew
that
every
man
was
at
his
post
fully
conscious
that
his
own
safety
the
safety
of
the
whole
boat
and
the
honor
of
the
fatherland
were
all
at
stake
and
dependent
on
his
individual
effort
i
knew
of
course
that
each
fine
fellow
down
in
the
machinery
room
or
at
the
torpedo
tubes
had
done
his
very
best
and
that
all
his
thoughts
were
centered
like
mine
in
keen
expectancy
on
the
firing
of
our
first
torpedo
the
eel
as
we
call
it
guarded
with
so
much
love
and
care
which
would
speed
along
accompanied
by
our
warmest
wishes
we
give
nicknames
to
our
torpedoes
mostly
feminine
names
side
by
side
below
lie
the
fat
bertha
the
yellow
mary
and
the
shining
emma
and
these
ladies
expected
to
be
treated
like
all
ladies
with
the
tenderest
care
and
courtesy
now
comes
the
announcement
from
the
torpedo
officer
the
torpedoes
are
cleared
for
firing
he
stands
with
a
firm
hand
awaiting
the
signal
from
his
commander
to
permit
the
torpedo
to
drive
ahead
against
the
hated
but
unconscious
adversary
and
to
bore
its
way
with
a
loud
report
deep
into
the
great
steel
flank
once
again
the
periscope
springs
for
an
instant
to
the
surface
and
then
glides
back
into
the
protecting
body
of
the
turret
the
captain
exclaims
we
are
at
them
and
the
news
spreads
like
wildfire
through
the
crew
he
gives
a
last
rapid
order
to
straighten
the
course
of
the
boat
the
torpedo
officer
announces
torpedo
ready
and
the
captain
after
one
quick
glance
through
the
periscope
as
it
slides
back
into
its
sheath
immediately
shouts
fire
even
without
the
prescribed
announcement
from
the
torpedo
officer
that
the
torpedo
had
been
set
off
every
one
knows
that
it
is
speeding
ahead
and
for
a
few
seconds
we
remain
in
anxious
suspense
until
a
dull
report
provokes
throughout
our
boat
loud
cheers
for
kaiser
and
for
empire
and
by
this
report
we
know
that
the
fat
bertha
has
reached
unhindered
her
destination
radiant
with
joy
the
commander
breathes
a
sigh
of
relief
and
he
does
not
check
the
young
sailor
at
the
wheel
who
seeks
to
grasp
his
hand
and
murmur
his
fervent
congratulations
but
congratulations
must
be
postponed
until
we
ascertain
that
our
success
is
complete
and
once
again
the
periscope
runs
up
towards
the
laughing
daylight
while
the
commander
in
happy
but
earnest
tones
utters
the
reassuring
words
the
ship
is
sinking
further
torpedoes
can
be
spared
he
then
permits
the
gratified
torpedo
officer
who
stands
by
his
side
a
quick
glance
through
the
periscope
to
verify
the
result
of
his
own
efficiency
it
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
care
of
the
personnel
of
the
torpedo
squad
that
the
torpedoes
are
maintained
in
such
perfect
condition
and
that
their
aim
is
so
correct
and
to
them
is
due
in
great
part
the
success
of
our
attack
the
commander
and
his
officer
exchange
a
knowing
look
for
they
have
seen
the
enemy
ship
heavily
listing
to
one
side
where
the
water
is
rushing
into
the
gaping
wound
and
soon
she
must
capsize
they
see
her
crew
hastily
lowering
the
life
boats
their
only
means
of
escape
and
this
is
a
sufficient
proof
of
our
victory
we
can
depart
now
in
all
security
concealing
our
presence
we
plunge
and
vanish
beneath
the
waters
having
reached
a
certain
distance
we
stop
to
make
sure
that
our
victim
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
we
behold
the
waves
playing
gently
and
smoothly
as
before
over
the
cold
watery
grave
of
the
once
proud
ship
and
we
hasten
away
from
the
scene
of
our
triumph

there
is
further
work
to
be
done
imagine
the
enthusiasm
our
dear
fallen
comrade
weddingen
and
his
crew
must
have
felt
as
the
loud
report
of
their
last
torpedo
announced
the
destruction
of
their
third
english
armed
cruiser
iv
mobilization
and
the
beginning
of
the
commercial
war
after
long
and
agitated
waiting
we
received
in
the
last
days
of
july
the
command
to
mobilize
joyful
expectation
was
visible
on
every
face
and
the
only
fear
that
prevailed
was
that
those
of
us
who
were
awaiting
our
orders
on
land
might
be
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
naval
battle
we
were
all
looking
forward
to
so
eagerly
a
few
years
ago
one
of
the
lords
of
the
english
admiralty
had
predicted
that
in
the
first
naval
battle
fought
between
germany
and
england
the
german
fleet
would
be
entirely
annihilated
we
naturally
only
smiled
in
derision
at
these
boastful
words
the
english
newspapers
besides
had
for
many
years
announced
that
whenever
german
officers
met
together
they
drank
a
toast
to
the
day
although
of
course
this
was
untrue
yet
we
were
all
burning
to
prove
in
battle
what
our
great
navy
had
learned
in
long
years
of
peace
a
mighty
engagement
at
sea
seemed
to
us
imminent
during
these
first
days
of
war
and
we
all
longed
to
be
in
it
i
was
however
at
the
moment
among
those
unfortunates
who
were
strapped
down
to
a
desk
in
the
admiralty
and
with
envy
i
beheld
my
comrades
rushing
to
active
service
for
i
had
always
hoped
to
lead
my
old
beloved
victoriously
against
the
enemy
we
had
all
placed
strong
hopes
in
the
part
our
submarines
would
eventually
play
in
a
great
crisis
but
we
never
dreamed
that
they
would
so
successfully
take
the
first
rôle
as
our
most
effective
weapon
in
naval
warfare

with
a
happiness
that
can
hardly
be

i
suddenly
received
the
order
to
take
over
the
command
of
a
fine
new
which
had
just
been
built
at
kiel
never
before
was
a
pen
more
quickly
thrown
aside
and
a

closed
than
when
i
handed
over
my
duties
in
the
admiralty
to
my
successor
and
shortly
afterwards
i
took
possession
of
my
new
splendid
boat
to
which
i
was
going
to
confide
all
my
luck
and
all
i
was
humanly
capable
of
doing
i
addressed
my
crew
in
a
short
speech
and
told
them
we
could
best
serve
our
almighty
war
lord
in
bringing
this
new
weapon
of
attack
confided
to
our
care
to
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
my
words
were
greeted
with
loud
cheers
there
was
much
work
to
be
done
in
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
our
submarine
which
had
only
just
come
off
the
ways
the
auxiliary
machines
had
to
be
tested
and
certain
inner
arrangements
made
but
thanks
to
the
untiring
zeal
of
the
crew
and
to
the
eager
help
we
received
from
the
imperial
navy
yard
our
task
was
soon
accomplished
after
a
few
short
trial
trips
and
firing
tests
i
was
able
to
declare
our
boat
ready
for
sea
and
for
war
and
after
everything
had
been
formally
surveyed
by
the
inspector
we
left
our
home
port
before
the
middle
of
august
departing
at
a
high
speed
we
bade
farewell
to
the
big
ships
still
at
their
moorings
and
we
soon
joined
our
fellow
submarines
who
had
already
in
the
first
fortnight
of
war
according
to
an
announcement
of
the
admiralty
staff
made
a
dash
as
far
as
the
english
coast
and
here
is
the
proud
record
of
what
they
further
accomplished
at
the
beginning
of
september
the
english
cruiser
pathfinder
was
torpedoed
by
hersing
who
later
sunk
the
two
ships
of
the
line
triumph
and
majestic
in
the
dardanelles
and
was
rewarded
with
our
highest
order
le
this
initial
success
proclaimed
our
submarines
to
be
our
greatest
weapon
of
offense
and
their
importance
became
of
renown
for
we
claim
the
honor
of
having
fired
the
first
successful
torpedo
shot
from
a
submarine
it
opened
a
new
era
in
maritime
warfare
and
was
the
answer
to
many
questions
which
had
puzzled
the
men
of
our
profession
the
whole
world
over
above
all
we
had
proved
that
a
german
after
a
long
and
difficult
voyage
could
reach
the
enemy
coast
and
after
penetrating
their
line
of
defense
was
able
to
send
one
of
their
ships
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
with
one
torpedo
shot
the
age
of
the
submarine
had
truly
begun
other
victories
followed
in
prompt
succession
weddingen
wonderful
prowess
off
the
hoek
of
holland
on
september
will
never
be
forgotten
in
the
space
of
an
hour
he
sunk
the
three
english
armored
cruisers
cressy
hague
and
aboukir
and
shortly
afterwards
dispatched
their
comrade
hawke
to
keep
them
company
at
the
bottom
of
the
north
sea
let
me
add
to
this
list
the
english
cruiser
hermes
near
dover
the
niger
off
the
downs
of
the
english
coast
the
russian
cruiser
pallada
in
the
baltic
and
a
great
number
of
other
english
torpedo
boats
torpedo
boat
destroyers
as
well
as
auxiliary
cruisers
and
transports
all
this
was
achieved
before
the
end
of
unfortunately
i
am
not
at
liberty
for
obvious
reasons
to
describe
my
own
part
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
hope
to
be
able
to
do
so
after
we
achieve
a
victorious
peace
our
dear
cousins
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
must
have
been
rather
disquieted
by
the
loss
of
so
much
shipping
at
the
hands
of
our
boats
or
of
our
mines
and
they
must
have
realized
that
a
new
method
of
warfare
had
begun
for
their
fleet
no
longer
paraded
in
the
north
sea
or
in
any
of
the
waters
in
the
war
zone
their
great
valuable
ships
were
withdrawn
and
the
patrol
of
their
coast
was
confided
only
to
smaller
craft
and
to
the
in
order
that
their
people
might
supposedly
sleep
in
peace
our
adversary
was
concealed
by
day
and
only
ventured
forth
at
night
confident
that
darkness
would
insure
his
safety
this
was
then
the
hour
for
us
to
lie
in
watch
for
our
prey
and
no
more
glorious
clarion
call
could
have
heralded
in
the
new
year
than
the
torpedo
shot
which
on
the
new
year
eve
of
sent
the
mighty
ship
of
the
line
formidable
to
the
bottom
of
the
channel
this
was
our
first
triumphant
victory
which
showed
that
not
even
darkness
could
circumvent
our
plans
and
which
dispelled
all
further
doubts
as
to
our
efficiency
a
few
days
after
the
sinking
of
the
formidable
a
piece
of
one
of
the
row
boats
was
washed
ashore
at
zeebrugge
and
now
adorns
our
sea
museum
as
the
only
reminder
left
of
the
great
ship
we
stood
at
last
on
the
same
footing
as
our
dear
old
sister
the
torpedo
boat
to
whom
we
in
reality
owed
our
present
development
and
from
now
on
in
proud
independence
we
were
justified
in
considering
ourselves
a
separate
branch
of
the
navy
now
that
england
felt
obliged
to
withhold
the
activities
of
her
fleet
she
instigated
against
us
the
commercial
blockade
and
she
obliged
neutrals
to
follow
a
prescribed
route
and
by
subjecting
their
vessels
to
search
she
prevented
them
from
selling
us
any
of
their
wares
in
this
manner
she
sought
to
redeem
herself
from
the
paralysis
we
had
brought
on
her
fleet
and
her
unscrupulous
treatment
of
the
right
of
nations
and
her
interpretation
of
the
freedom
of
the
seas
are
only
too
well
known
we
retaliated
on
february
by
prescribing
a
certain
danger
zone
which
extended
around
great
britain
and
ireland
and
along
the
north
coast
of
france
by
this
interdict
public
opinion
was
enlightened
as
to
the
part
our
were
going
to
perform
in
this
new
commercial
warfare
a
part
i
must
admit
that
few
people
had
anticipated
before
the
commencement
of
hostilities
of
course
new
demands
were
to
be
made
upon
us
we
should
have
to
make
long
undersea
trips
and
remain
for
some
time
in
the
enemy
waters
after
which
we
should
have
to
return
unperceived
the
english
called
it
german
bluff
but
their
tone
soon
changed
after
we
had
made
our
first
raid
in
the
heart
of
the
irish
channel
and
few
of
them
now
ventured
abroad
except
when
forced
by
the
most
imperative
obligations
at
the
end
of
october
the
first
english
steamer
glitra
was
sunk
off
the
norwegian
coast
it
carried
a
cargo
of
sewing
machines
whisky
and
steel
from
leith
the
captain
was
wise
enough
to
stop
at
the
first
signal
of
the
commander
of
the
and
he
thereby
saved
the
lives
of
his
crew
who
escaped
with
their
belongings
after
the
steamer
was
peacefully
sunk
if
others
later
had
likewise
followed
his
example
innocent
passengers
and
crew
would
not
have
been
drowned
and
after
all
people
are
fond
of
their
own
lives
but
these
english
captains
were
following
the
orders
of
their
government
to
save
their
ships
through
flight
the
english
authorities
even
went
so
far
as
to
inaugurate
a
system
at
sea
by
offering
a
reward
to
any
captain
who
rammed
or
destroyed
a
german
submarine
although
the
latter
could
only
obey
this
command
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
but
what
cared
the
rulers
in
england
for
the
existence
of
men
belonging
to
the
lower
classes
of
the
nation
they
offered
tempting
rewards
for
these
exploits
in
the
shape
of
gold
watches
and
bribed
the
captains
of
the
merchant
marine
with
the
promise
of
being
raised
to
the
rank
of
officers
in
the
reserve
therefore
the
british
newspapers
were
filled
with
the
account
of
the
destruction
of
german
and
of
the
generous
rewards
given
for
these
fine
deeds
it
was
jolly
for
us
on
our
return
to
port
to
read
the
record
of
our
own
doom
and
scarcely
would
there
be
a
submarine
afloat
if
these
records
had
been
true
i
should
like
to
tell
a
short
story
in
connection
with
these
assertions
of
english
prowess
one
of
their
small
steamers
had
actually
contrived
in
misty
weather
to
ram
the
turret
of
one
of
our
submarines
while
it
was
in
the
act
of
submerging
the
english
captain
was
loudly
praised
in
all
the
newspapers
and
received
the
promised
rewards
for
having
sunk
as
he
declared
a
german
he
had
distinctly
felt
he
said
the
shock
of
the
collision
his
statement
was
certainly
accurate
for
the
submarine
was
also
conscious
of
the
shock
but
it
was
fortunately
followed
with
no
evil
results
and
our
commander
had
the
joyful
surprise
shortly
afterwards
when
he
emerged
to
find
the
blade
of
the
foe
propeller
stuck
in
the
wall
of
the
turret
whose
excellent
material
had
preserved
it
from
serious
injury
we
happily
hope
that
the
german
empire
will
never
run
so
short
of
bronze
that
it
will
be
obliged
to
appropriate
for
the
melting
pot
this
fine
propeller
blade
which
is
one
of
the
many
interesting
trophies
preserved
in
our
submarine
museum
v
our
own
part
in
the
commercial
war
and
our
first
captured
steamer
as
we
have
said
above
our
war
against
the
merchant
marine
of
the
allied
nations
began
in
february
throughout
the
war
zone
established
around
the
english
and
french
coasts
day
after
day
the
number
increased
of
steamers
and
sail
boats
that
we
had
sunk
and
commercial
relations
between
all
countries
were
seriously
menaced
the
english
were
forced
to
believe
in
our
threats
and
even
the
shipping
trade
of
the
neutrals
had
greatly
diminished
the
mighty
british
fleet
no
longer
dared
to
patrol
the
seas
and
the
merchantmen
were
told
to
look
out
for
themselves
and
were
even
armed
for
the
purpose
while
the
winter
lasted
there
was
not
much
for
us
to
do
and
we
awaited
fine
weather
with
lively
impatience
during
this
period
our
victorious
armies
had
occupied
belgium
and
serbia
and
conquered
the
russian
girdle
of
fortifications
the
subsequent
participation
of
italy
produced
but
little
impression
on
the
fortunate
current
of
events
whereas
turkey
entrance
at
our
side
in
the
war
opened
a
new
field
of
operation
for
our
in
the
mediterranean
at
last
i
myself
was
ordered
to
prepare
for
a
long
voyage
which
i
welcomed
most
joyfully
after
several
months
of
comparative
inaction
we
were
to
remain
in
the
enemy
waters
for
several
weeks
which
of
course
involved
the
most
elaborate
preparations
every
portion
of
the
boat
was
again
minutely
inspected
every
machine
repaired
and
thoroughly
tested
like
a
horse
we
must
be
in
perfect
condition
for
the
coming
race
each
man
in
the
crew
holds
a
responsible
position
and
knows
that
the
slightest
neglect
endangers
the
welfare
of
the
whole
boat
the
commander
must
be
certain
that
everything
is
completed
according
to
the
highest
standard
the
boat
is
frequently
submerged
and
performs
various
exercises
underseas
while
it
is
still
safe
in
the
friendly
waters
off
our
own
coast
we
are
always
abundantly
provisioned
for
the
thirty
men
must
be
given
the
most
nourishing
food
to
be
fit
for
their
arduous
tasks
i
have
often
laughed
to
see
the
quantity
of
provisions
placed
on
deck
for
the
dealers
of
course
are
never
allowed
to
penetrate
the
inner
shrine
of
the
boat
and
yet
we
have
often
returned
from
a
long
cruise
because
our
food
was
coming
to
an
end
every
available
corner
and
space
is
filled
with
provisions
the
cook
a
sailor
specially
trained
for
the
job
must
hunt
below
in
every
conceivable
place
for
his
vegetables
and
meats
the
latter
are
stored
in
the
coolest
quarters
next
to
the
munitions
the
sausages
are
put
close
to
the
red
grenades
the
butter
lies
beneath
one
of
the
sailor
bunks
and
the
salt
and
spice
have
been
known
to
stray
into
the
commander
cabin
below
his
berth
when
everything
is
in
readiness
the
crew
is
given
a
short
leave
on
land
to
go
and
take
the
much
coveted
hot
bath
this
is
the
most
important
ceremony
before
and
after
a
cruise
especially
when
the
men
return
for
when
they
have
remained
unwashed
for
weeks
soaked
with
machine
oil
and
saturated
with
salt
spray
their
first
thought
is
a
hot
bath
at
sea
we
must
be
very
sparing
of
our
supply
and
its
use
for
washing
must
be
carefully
restricted
the
commander
usually
spends
the
eve
of
his
departure
in
the
circle
of
his
comrades
but
it
is
a
solemn
moment
for
him
as
soon
as
he
sails
from
his
native
shore
he
becomes
responsible
for
every
action
which
is
taken
and
for
many
weeks
no
orders
reach
him
from
his
superiors
he
is
unable
to
ask
any
one
advice
or
to
consult
with
his
inferiors
and
he
stands
alone
in
the
solitude
of
his
higher
rank
even
the
common
sailor
is
conscious
of
the
seriousness
of
the
task
ahead
and
of
the
adventures
which
may
occur
below
seas
no
loud
farewells
no
jolly
hand
no
beckoning
girls
are
there
to
bid
us
godspeed
quietly
and
silently
do
we
take
our
departure
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
our
nearest
and
dearest
know
whither
we
go
if
we
remain
in
home
waters
or
if
we
go
forth
to
encounter
the
foe
we
can
bid
no
one
farewell
it
is
through
the
absence
of
news
that
they
know
that
we
have
gone
and
no
one
is
aware
except
the
special
high
officer
in
this
department
of
the
admiralty
who
gives
the
commander
his
orders
on
what
errand
we
are
bound
or
when
we
shall
return
for
the
slightest
indiscretion
might
forfeit
the
success
of
our
mission
before
dawn
on
the
day
of
our
departure
the
last
pieces
of
equipment
and
of
armament
are
put
on
board
and
the
machinery
is
once
more
tested
then
at
the
appointed
hour
the
chief
engineer
informs
the
commander
that
everything
is
ready
a
shrill
whistle
bids
the
crew
cast
loose
the
moorings
and
at
the
sound
of
the
signal
bell
the
boat
begins
to
move
as
we
glide
rapidly
out
of
port
we
exchange
by
mutual
signs
a
few
last
greetings
with
our
less
favored
comrades
on
the
decks
of
the
ships
we
leave
behind
who
no
doubt
also
long
to
go
forth
and
meet
the
enemy
the
land
begins
to
disappear
in
the
distance
and
as
we
gaze
at
the
bobbing
buoys
that
vanish
in
our
wake
we
hope
that
after
a
successful
journey
they
will
again
be
our
guides
as
we
return
to
our
dear
german
homes
after
gliding
along
smoothly
at
first
we
soon
feel
the
boat
tossing
among
the
bigger
waves
but
we
laugh
as
they
heave
and
dip
around
us
for
we
know
everything
is
shipshape
on
board
and
that
they
can
do
us
no
harm
the
wild
seas
are
bearing
us
onward
towards
the
hated
foe
and
after
all
in
the
end
they
lull
so
peacefully
to
sleep
the
sailor
in
his
eternal
rest
in
this
manner
on
a
fine
march
morning
we
steered
our
course
to
the
english
coast
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
commercial
war
gently
the
waves
splashed
around
the
prow
and
glided
over
the
lower
deck
our
duty
was
to
examine
every
merchantman
we
met
with
the
object
of
destroying
those
of
the
enemy
the
essential
thing
was
to
ascertain
the
nationality
of
the
ships
we
stopped
on
the
following
morning
we
were
given
several
opportunities
to
fulfill
our
task
it
is
well
known
that
the
english
merchantmen
were
ordered
by
their
government
to
fly
a
neutral
flag
so
as
to
avoid
being
captured
by
our
warships
we
all
remember
how
on
one
of
her
earlier
trips
through
the
war
zone
the
gigantic
lusitania
received
a
wireless
message
to
conceal
the
union
jack
and
to
fly
the
stars
and
stripes
of
the
united
states
but
destiny
after
all
overtook
her
at
a
later
date
all
of
us
commanders
were
told
not
to
trust
to
the
nationality
of
any
flag
we
saw
and
to
stop
every
steamer
on
our
path
and
to
examine
her
papers
thoroughly
even
these
might
be
falsified
and
we
must
therefore
judge
for
ourselves
according
to
the
appearance
of
the
crew
and
the
way
in
which
the
ship
was
built
whether
she
were
in
reality
a
neutral
of
course
many
neutrals
had
to
suffer
from
the
deceptions
practiced
by
the
english
and
although
their
colors
were
painted
on
their
sides
and
they
were
lighted
at
night
by
electricity
yet
this
device
could
also
be
copied
therefore
we
were
obliged
to
detain
and
examine
all
the
ships
we
encountered
greatly
to
the
inconvenience
of
the
innocent
ones
i
will
describe
the
manner
in
which
a
warship
undertakes
the
search
of
a
merchantman
through
flag
signals
the
merchantman
is
bidden
to
stop
immediately
if
he
does
not
obey
the
warship
makes
his
orders
more
imperative
by
firing
blank
shot
as
a
warning
if
then
the
merchantman
tries
to
escape
the
warship
is
justified
in
hitting
the
runaway
on
the
other
hand
if
the
steamer
or
sailboat
obeys
the
summons
then
the
warship
puts
out
a
boat
with
an
armed
prize
crew
and
an
officer
to
look
over
the
ship
papers
these
consist
in
certificates
of
nationality
of
the
sailing
port
and
port
of
destination
and
they
contain
a
bill
of
lading
as
to
the
nature
of
the
cargo
also
the
names
of
the
crew
and
a
passenger
list
if
it
is
a
passenger
steamer
if
the
ship
is
a
neutral
and
her
papers
are
satisfactory
she
is
allowed
to
proceed
whereas
an
enemy
ship
is
either
captured
or
sunk
if
a
neutral
ship
carries
contraband
of
war
this
is
either
confiscated
or
destroyed
but
if
it
exceeds
half
the
total
cargo
then
this
ship
is
also
condemned
it
is
nearly
impossible
for
a
submarine
to
send
a
prize
crew
on
board
a
big
ship
therefore
neutral
states
have
given
their
captains
the
order
to
go
in
a
ship
boat
and
deliver
their
papers
themselves
on
board
the
submarine
but
they
often
annoyed
us
by
a
long
parley
and
delay
and
it
was
always
with
a
feeling
of
disappointment
that
we
were
obliged
to
leave
inactive
our
cannons
and
torpedoes
the
crew
sadly
exclaiming
after
all
they
were
only
neutrals
one
sunny
afternoon
we
were
in
the
act
of
examining
the
papers
of
a
dutch
steamer
that
we
had
stopped
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
meuse
lightship
when
we
perceived
on
the
horizon
another
steamer
coming
rapidly
towards
us
and
we
judged
by
its
outline
that
it
was
of
english
construction
the
steamer
we
were
examining
proved
to
be
unobjectionable
in
every
respect
and
sailing
only
between
neutral
ports
so
we
dismissed
it
and
just
as
it
was
departing
the
english
steamer
evidently
apprehending
our
presence
turned
about
in
great
haste
in
hope
to
escape
from
us
and
steered
with
full
steam
ahead
towards
the
english
shores
to
seek
the
protection
of
the
ships
on
the
watch
patroling
the
english
coast
the
english
captain
well
knew
what
fate
awaited
him
if
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
wicked
german
mighty
clouds
of
smoke
rose
from
her
funnels
giving
evidence
of
the
active
endeavors
of
the
stokers
in
the
to
bring
the
engines
up
to
their
highest
speed
and
before
we
had
time
to
give
the
signal
to
stop
the
steamer
was
in
flight
meanwhile
we
had
also
put
on
all
steam
in
pursuit
and
drove
our
engines
to
their
utmost
capacity
the
english
ship
was
going
at
a
great
pace
and
we
had
many
knots
to
cover
before
we
could
catch
up
with
her
to
impose
our
commands
for
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
international
we
had
hoisted
stop
at
once
or
we
fire
and
she
was
striving
her
uttermost
to
reach
a
zone
of
safety
our
prow
plunged
into
the
surging
seas
and
showered
boat
and
crew
alike
with
silvery
sparkling
foam
the
engines
were
being
urged
to
their
greatest
power
and
the
whir
of
the
propeller
proved
that
below
at
the
motor
valves
each
man
was
doing
his
very
best
anxiously
we
measured
the
distance
that
still
separated
us
from
our
prey
was
it
diminishing
or
would
they
get
away
from
us
before
our
guns
could
take
effect
joyfully
we
saw
the
interval
lessening
between
us
and
before
long
our
first
warning
shot
across
her
bow
raised
a
high
threatening
column
of
water
but
still
the
englishman
hoped
to
escape
from
us
and
the
thick
smoke
belching
from
the
funnels
showed
that
the
stokers
were
shoveling
more
and
more
coal
into
the
glowing
furnace
they
well
knew
what
risk
they
had
to
run
even
after
two
shots
were
discharged
from
the
steel
mouths
of
our
cannons
right
and
left
on
either
side
of
the
fugitive
which
must
have
warned
the
captain
that
the
next
shot
would
undoubtedly
strike
the
stern
he
was
still
resolved
neither
to
stop
nor
surrender
nothing
now
remained
for
us
but
to
use
our
last
means
to
enforce
our
will
with
a
whistling
sound
a
shell
flew
from
the
muzzle
of
our
cannon
and
a
few
seconds
later
fell
with
a
loud
crash
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
on
the
rear
deck
of
the
steamer
this
produced
the
desired
effect
immediately
the
steamer
stopped
and
informed
us
by
three
quick
blasts
from
the
steam
whistle
the
international
signal
that
the
engines
would
be
reversed
and
the
ship
stopped
the
captain
had
given
up
his
wild
race
huge
white
clouds
from
the
uselessly
accumulated
steam
rose
from
the
funnels
and
to
our
signal
abandon
the
ship
at
once
the
englishman
replied
with
a
heavy
heart
by
hoisting
a
white
and
red
striped
pennon
the
preconcerted
international
sign
that
our
order
had
been
understood
and
was
being
obeyed
this
small
striped
pennon
has
a
deep
significance
it
means
that
a
captain
accepts
this
most
painful
necessity
knowing
that
his
dear
old
boat
will
soon
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
truly
a
difficult
decision
for
the
captain
of
a
proud
ship
to
make
the
crew
were
by
this
time
reconciled
to
their
fate
and
as
we
drew
near
to
parley
with
the
captain
the
life
boats
were
launched
the
men
tossed
in
their
belongings
and
jumping
in
took
their
places
at
the
oars
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
we
on
the
other
hand
were
pleased
with
our
capture
i
have
often
shaken
hands
with
the
gunner
who
had
fired
the
last
deadly
shot
for
we
waste
no
emotion
over
our
adversary
fate
with
every
enemy
ship
sent
to
the
bottom
one
hope
of
the
hated
foe
is
annihilated
we
simply
pay
off
our
account
against
their
criminal
wish
to
starve
all
our
people
our
women
and
our
children
as
they
are
unable
to
beat
us
in
open
fight
with
polished
steel
ought
we
not
therefore
to
rejoice
in
our
justifiable
satisfaction
after
the
crew
had
left
in
two
boats
the
blazing
hull
of
the
leuwarden
of
harwich
a
shot
was
aimed
at
the
water
line
mighty
jets
of
water
poured
into
the
rear
storeroom
and
the
heavy
listing
of
the
ship
showed
that
her
last
hour
had
struck
we
beckoned
to
the
captain
to
row
up
beside
us
and
deliver
his
papers
he
stepped
silently
on
board
and
we
exchanged
salutes
as
i
saw
that
the
two
of
men
were
lying
off
within
hearing
on
either
side
of
us
i
took
this
opportunity
to
admonish
the
captain
about
his
foolhardy
attempt
to
escape
and
how
he
thereby
had
endangered
the
lives
of
his
crew
the
latter
realizing
the
justice
of
my
remarks
thanked
us
for
having
saved
them
by
respectfully
lifting
their
caps
the
captain
awkwardly
excused
himself
by
saying
he
had
simply
hoped
to
get
away
i
then
notified
these
people
whom
we
had
saved
that
we
would
take
them
in
tow
to
the
meuse
lightship
at
this
the
old
captain
realized
to
what
useless
dangers
he
had
exposed
his
men
and
what
cause
he
had
to
be
grateful
to
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
seized
my
hand
and
murmured
his
thanks
i
willingly
took
his
outstretched
hand
at
that
instant
a
dutch
pilot
steamboat
which
had
been
attracted
to
the
spot
by
the
sound
of
firing
hove
in
sight
and
i
committed
the
englishmen
to
its
care
we
all
desired
before
departing
in
opposite
directions
to
witness
the
final
sinking
of
the
steamer
for
apparently
the
english
also
wanted
to
see
the
last
of
their
fine
ship
and
we
awaited
the
great
moment
in
silence
we
had
not
long
to
wait
the
stern
of
the
ship
sank
deeper
and
deeper
whereas
the
bow
rose
sharply
in
the
air
till
at
last
with
a
loud
gurgle
the
whole
steamer
was
drawn
down
and
the
waters
bubbled
and
roared
over
the
sunken
wreck
there
was
now
one
less
fine
ship
of
the
english
merchant
marine
afloat
on
the
ocean
we
had
all
seen
enough
and
each
one
went
his
way
our
course
was
pointed
westward
towards
new
endeavors
while
the
dutchman
steered
for
the
nearest
port
in
order
to
land
the
shipwrecked
crew
i
think
it
was
our
english
friends
who
waved
a
friendly
farewell
from
the
deck
of
the
pilot
steamboat
in
grateful
recognition
for
our
having
saved
their
lives
although
they
may
not
actually
have
wished
us
we
read
in
the
dutch
papers
a
few
days
later
an
accurate
description
of
the
sinking
of
the
leuwarden
and
the
english
captain
was
fain
to
acknowledge
how
well
we
had
treated
him
every
captain
of
an
english
steamer
might
have
been
treated
in
like
manner
had
not
the
english
government
wished
it
otherwise
vi
the
capture
of
two
prize
steamers
the
next
day
an
opportunity
offered
itself
to
us
which
opened
to
submarines
a
new
field
of
activity
in
the
commercial
war
it
was
a
gray
misty
morning
the
sea
was
becalmed
and
over
the
still
waters
a
heavy
vapor
hung
low
like
a
veil
before
the
rising
sun
but
little
could
be
seen
and
we
had
to
keep
a
sharper
lookout
than
usual
to
avoid
running
unawares
into
a
hostile
ship
and
we
also
had
to
be
ready
for
a
sudden
submersion
we
strained
all
the
more
an
attentive
ear
to
every
sound
for
it
is
well
known
that
in
a
fog
during
a
calm
we
sailors
can
perceive
the
most
distant
noise
that
comes
over
the
water
in
time
of
peace
fog
horns
and
whistles
give
warning
of
any
approaching
vessel
but
in
time
of
war
on
the
contrary
no
vessel
wishes
to
betray
its
presence
it
is
essential
for
us
to
have
two
men
down
below
at
listening
posts
with
their
ears
glued
to
the
sides
of
the
boat
to
catch
the
throbbing
of
a
propeller
or
the
rush
of
waves
dashing
against
the
prow
of
a
ship
or
any
suspicious
vibrations
for
these
noises
are
easily
discernible
under
sea
water
being
an
excellent
sound
conductor
on
this
march
morning
we
were
all
keenly
intent
on
the
approach
of
some
ship
many
times
already
as
we
stood
on
the
bridge
we
had
been
deceived
by
some
unreal
vision
or
some
delusive
sound
our
overstrained
nerves
transformed
our
too
lively
fancy
into
seeming
reality
and
in
a
thick
fog
objects
are
strangely
magnified
and
distorted
a
floating
board
may
assume
the
shape
of
a
boat
or
a
motor
launch
be
taken
for
a
steamer
i
remember
a
little
story
about
a
seeking
to
enter
a
harbor
in
a
heavy
fog
every
one
on
board
was
looking
in
vain
for
a
buoy
to
indicate
the
channel
when
the
captain
himself
called
out
it
is
for
me
then
to
point
out
the
buoy
there
it
is
but
as
they
drew
near
the
buoy
floating
on
the
water
spread
but
a
pair
of
wings
and
flew
away
in
the
shape
of
a
gull
and
many
a
gull
in
a
fog
may
have
deceived
other
experienced
seamen
but
to
return
to
our
own
adventures
on
this
misty
morning
we
not
only
saw
gulls
rising
from
the
sea
and
boards
floating
on
the
water
but
we
also
encountered
english
mines
adrift
which
had
parted
from
their
moorings
and
to
these
we
thought
it
safer
to
give
a
wide
berth
at
last
the
fog
lifted
and
we
discovered
in
the
distance
a
few
knots
away
a
steamer
we
immediately
went
in
pursuit
rapidly
it
steamed
ahead
but
we
caught
up
with
it
and
found
it
belonged
to
the
line
but
as
it
was
steering
for
the
english
coast
towards
the
mouth
of
the
thames
we
took
for
granted
it
carried
a
contraband
cargo
we
signaled
for
it
to
stop
but
the
steamer
refused
to
obey
our
command
and
increased
its
speed
having
ascertained
that
we
could
easily
overtake
it
we
spared
our
shot
which
must
be
carefully
preserved
for
more
useful
purposes
after
a
chase
which
lasted
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
only
a
thousand
meters
remained
between
us
the
dutch
captain
wisely
gave
up
a
further
attempt
to
escape
and
awaited
our
orders
in
compliance
with
my
signal
he
sent
his
first
officer
in
a
boat
with
the
ship
papers
while
we
lay
alongside
the
steamer
gently
rocking
to
and
fro
the
crew
and
passengers
flocked
on
deck
to
gaze
at
us
with
wondering
eyes
and
we
in
return
tried
to
discover
to
what
nationality
they
belonged
on
reading
the
papers
the
officer
handed
me
i
saw
the
steamer
was
the
batavian
iv
destined
for
london
carrying
a
cargo
of
provisions
which
is
contraband
of
war
i
had
to
make
a
rapid
decision
as
to
the
fate
of
the
steamer
and
i
resolved
to
bring
the
batavian
into
one
of
the
belgian
ports
now
in
our
possession
no
had
ever
attempted
such
a
feat
before
but
why
not
try
of
course
we
had
to
cover
a
long
distance
with
the
imminent
threat
of
being
overtaken
by
english
warships
but
if
we
did
succeed
it
was
a
very

besides
the

was
in

and
it
would

taken
from
the
deck
of
one
of
her
victims
the
dutch
officer
was
notified
that
a
prize
crew
would
be
at
once
sent
on
board
his
steamer
to
conduct
it
to
the
port
of
zeebrugge
he
opened
wondering
eyes
but
made
no
protest
for
he
was
fully
aware
of
our
cannons
turned
on
his
ship
and
of
the
loaded
pistols
of
our
crew
the
crew
and
passengers
on
board
the
dutchman
were
no
less
astounded
when
our
prize
command
consisting
of
one
officer
and
one
sailor
climbed
up
on
deck
i
could
not
well
dispense
myself
with
more
men
and
in
case
my
prize
was
released
by
the
english
it
would
be
better
they
had
so
few
prisoners
of
ours
to
take
the
dutch
captain
raised
several
objections
at
being
led
away
captive
in
this
manner
above
all
he
was
afraid
of
the
german
mines
strewn
before
the
entrance
of
zeebrugge
but
my
officer
reassured
him
by
telling
him
we
should
lead
the
way
and
he
would
therefore
run
no
risk
he
finally
had
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
so
we
proceeded
towards
the
shores
of
flanders
we
in
the
proud
consciousness
of
a
new
achievement
and
the
dutchman
lamenting
over
the
seizure
of
his
valuable
cargo
the
passengers
must
have
wondered
what
was
in
store
for
them
many
of
the
ladies
were
lightly
clad
having
been
roused
in
fright
from
their
morning
slumbers
and
their
anxious
eyes
stared
at
us
while
we
merrily
looked
back
at
them
our
officer
on
board
exchanged
continual
signals
with
us
and
we
were
soon
conscious
with
a
feeling
of
envy
as
we
gazed
through
our
field
glasses
that
he
was
getting
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
fair
sex
on
board
our
prize
we
had
feared
at
first
that
he
might
have
some
disagreeable
experiences
but
his
first
message
spelled
there
are
a
great
many
ladies
on
board
and
the
second
we
are
having
a
delicious
breakfast
and
the
third
the
captain
speaks
excellent
german
so
after
this
we
were
quite
reassured
concerning
him
an
hour
may
have
elapsed
when
a
cloud
of
smoke
on
the
eastern
horizon
announced
the
approach
of
another
steamer
and
the
idea
that
we
might
perhaps
capture
a
second
prize
ship
was
very
alluring
the
wisdom
of
abandoning
for
a
while
our
first
captive
was
considered
somewhat
doubtful
if
we
delayed
it
might
escape
after
darkness
set
in
but
when
i
heard
my
officers
exclaim
what
a
fine
steamer
i
decided
to
try
for
it
the
batavian
was
ordered
to
proceed
slowly
on
the
same
course
and
we
would
catch
up
with
it
later
then
turning
my
attention
to
steamer
no
i
made
quickly
in
her
direction
to
intercept
her
on
her
way
to
england
after
half
an
hour
pursuit
we
signaled
for
her
to
stop
and
we
discovered
she
was
also
dutch
the
captain
seeing
it
was
useless
to
try
and
escape
put
out
a
boat
and
came
on
board
with
the
ship
papers
he
seemed
thoroughly
displeased
at
the
meeting
and
hoped
no
doubt
by
coming
himself
to
get
away
more
easily
but
of
this
expectation
he
was
to
be
sadly
disabused
on
discovering
that
he
was
also
carrying
contraband
of
war
cases
of
eggs
for
london
i
ordered
him
to
follow
us
to
zeebrugge
one
officer
and
a
stoker
for
i
could
not
spare
another
sailor
accompanied
him
as
our
prize
command
on
board
his
ship
the
zaanstroom
and
after
a
lapse
of
an
hour
and
a
half
followed
by
no
we
caught
up
with
no
the
difficulty
of
my
task
can
be
easily
imagined
for
i
was
obliged
to
make
the
two
steamers
follow
each
other
at
a
given
interval
and
at
the
same
speed
like
a
shepherd
dog
herding
his
flock
i
had
to
cruise
round
my
two
captives
and
force
them
to
steer
a
straight
and
even
course
for
one
tried
occasionally
to
outdistance
the
other
probably
with
the
desire
to
escape
in
the
foggy
weather
which
increased
my
fear
of
not
reaching
the
flemish
coast
before
dark
but
finally
i
got
the
steamers
into
line
and
where
persuasion
might
have
failed
the
menace
of
my
cannons
was
doubtless
my
surest
reason
for
success
my
second
officer
on
the
zaanstroom
signaled
that
everything
was
going
to
his
liking
and
that
they
were
just
sitting
down
to
a
savory
meal
of
dropped
eggs
this
was
reassuring
news
and
i
could
also
feel
tranquil
on
his
behalf
besides
in
a
few
hours
we
should
be
safely
under
cover
of
our
coast
artillery
we
notified
the
pilot
depot
by
wireless
to
send
us
a
pilot
for
each
ship
and
our
messages
having
been
acknowledged
we
were
certain
of
being
warmly
welcomed
and
that
every
preparation
would
be
made
for
the
reception
of
our
two
prizes
the
closer
we
got
to
the
coast
the
heavier
the
fog
lay
upon
the
water
a
not
unusual
experience
at
sea
we
had
to
advance
with
the
greatest
caution
our
led
the
way
to
confirm
anew
the
assurance
we
had
given
our
two
steamers
that
they
were
in
no
danger
of
mines
we
had
to
measure
the
depth
of
water
repeatedly
with
the
lead
and
so
doing
we
had
to
stop
very
often
otherwise
the
lead
being
dragged
by
the
current
draws
the
line
to
an
inaccurate
length
it
is
but
too
easy
a
matter
to
run
aground
off
the
coast
of
flanders
as
submerged
sandbanks
are
everywhere
to
be
encountered
and
this
would
have
been
in
our
present
case
a
most
unfortunate
occurrence
this
continual
stopping
rather
disturbed
the
order
of
our
march
for
steamers
are
more
unwieldy
and
less
accustomed
to
rapid
maneuvering
than
war
vessels
luckily
all
went
well
with
us
for
after
a
fine
trip
of
several
hours
we
gladly
greeted
our
german
lying
off
the
port
of
zeebrugge
and
the
lighthouse
on
the
mole
beckoned
to
us
from
afar
through
the
thin
afternoon
mist
we
quickly
surrendered
our
two
captive
to
the
patrol
of
the
port
authorities
into
whose
care
and
surveillance
they
were
now
entrusted
our
job
for
the
day
was
over
and
we
could
joyfully
hurry
to
our
berth
within
the
harbor
we
passed
along
the
tremendous
stone
quay
of
the
artificial
port
of
zeebrugge
it
extends
several
kilometers
and
was
built
by
leopold
ii
with
english
money
it
had
cost
many
many
millions
and
was
intended
to
serve
quite
another
purpose
than
its
present
one
we
could
look
with
defiance
at
the
mouth
of
our
german
cannons
that
gaped
over
the
highest
edge
of
the
jetty
towards
the
sea
as
if
awaiting
the
foe
farther
on
up
the
mole
instead
of
english
troops
that
the
king
would
so
gladly
have
sent
over
in
transports
to
march
through
neutral
belgium
and
pay
us
an
uninvited
visit
stood
side
by
side
our
own
brave
fellows
of
the
army
and
of
the
navy
men
from
every
branch
of
the
service
in
their
different
uniforms
were
visible
as
they
crowded
on
the
pier
to
witness
our
arrival
with
our
two
prize
boats
for
the
news
of
this
unusual
capture
had
already
spread
far
and
wide
and
they
all
wanted
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
their
enthusiasm
would
have
been
even
greater
had
they
guessed
that
concealed
within
the
hull
of
our
two
vessels
an
easter
feast
of
dainties
lay
in
store
for
them
but
even
without
this
incentive
a
tremendous
cheer
from
a
thousand
throats
hailed
our
appearance
as
we
rounded
the
mole
and
our
thirty
voices
returned
as
hearty
if
not
as
loud
a
three
times
repeated
cheer
for
the
garrison
of
zeebrugge
our
tow
lines
were
caught
by
the
eager
hands
of
the
sailors
and
in
a
jiffy
we
were
lying
securely
alongside
the
quay
safe
in
port
to
rest
in
peace
a
day
or
two
after
a
many
days
cruise
enlivened
by
such
exciting
events
our
friends
of
the
navy
whom
we
had
not
seen
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
came
to
visit
us
at
once
much
gay
news
was
exchanged
and
also
sad
regrets
expressed
at
the
loss
of
dear
fallen
comrades
shortly
afterwards
one
of
the
dutch
captains
escorted
by
two
guards
asked
me
to
grant
him
an
interview
and
i
was
glad
to
make
his
personal
acquaintance
we
discussed
over
a
little
glass
of
port
wine
which
we
were
both
surely
entitled
to
the
incidents
of
the
day
and
he
gave
vent
to
his
affliction
at
being
thus
seized
by
ejaculating
a
great
steamer
like
mine
to
be
captured
by
a
little
beast
like
yours
i
could
sympathize
with
his
feelings
for
he
had
sustained
a
severe
pecuniary
loss
and
he
well
knew
what
would
become
of
his
ship
and
cargo
according
to
prize
law
but
i
suspected
he
found
some
consolation
in
having
a
companion
in
misfortune
for
the
other
dutch
captain
had
to
submit
to
the
same
conditions
we
shook
hands
and
parted
excellent
friends
knowing
that
each
one
of
us
had
only
accomplished
his
duty
before
making
my
official
report
i
inspected
my
two
prizes
that
were
docked
just
behind
us
a
chain
parted
them
from
the
rest
of
the
quay
with
sentries
placed
on
guard
i
gave
the
preference
of
my
first
visit
naturally
as
a
polite
man
should
to
the
steamer
with
so
many
of
the
fair
sex
on
board
i
hoped
that
by
appearing
surrounded
by
my
officers
i
should
dispel
their
fear
of
the
german
barbarians
i
was
told
the
ladies
belonged
to
a
variety
troupe
that
was
to
give
a
performance
the
next
evening
in
london
poor
london
to
be
deprived
by
our
fault
of
an
enjoyable
evening
among
the
other
passengers
were
belgians
and
french
who
had
waited
six
weeks
in
holland
for
a
chance
to
get
across
and
also
an
american
reporter
of
the
hearst
newspaper
he
had
a
camera
for
taking
moving
pictures
and
we
discovered
later
that
he
had
photographed
the
whole
occurrence
of
the
capture
of
the
ship
by
our
submarine
a
few
days
later
the
of
march
published
several
of
his
pictures
which
eventually
found
their
way
to
many
american
papers
i
was
ordered
that
evening
to
dine
with
the
commanding
admiral
of
the
marine
corps
excellency
von
schröder
and
a
motor
called
for
me
and
took
me
to
brügge
where
he
resided
the
peaceful
landscape
and
the
ploughed
fields
betrayed
but
few
signs
of
war
and
i
saw
belgian
peasants
and
german
soldiers
planting
together
the
seed
for
the
coming
harvest
while
the
authorities
were
passing
judgment
on
my
two
prizes
i
had
a
chance
to
visit
the
surrounding
country
the
english
had
destroyed
in
their
retreat
everything
in
zeebrugge
except
the
new
palace
hotel
the
new
post
office
and
the
belgian
bank
i
made
the
most
of
this
short
opportunity
to
observe
the
doings
of
our
men
in
this
conquered
land
paid
for
with
german
blood
i
was
interested
to
note
how
our
marines
had
been
incorporated
in
every
branch
of
the
army
service
and
how
easily
they
adapted
themselves
to
this
new
life
they
served
as
infantry
in
the
trenches
as
artillery
behind
the
great
coast
guns
and
also
as
cavalry
mounted
on
big
flemish
mares
they
had
even
been
transformed
into
car
conductors
on
the
electric
line
that
runs
behind
the
dunes
between
zeebrugge
and
ostend
in
fact
they
filled
every
kind
of
position
and
few
belgians
were
to
be
seen
we
had
created
here
a
second
german
fatherland
and
home
notwithstanding
the
enemy
reports
that
we
had
acted
like
huns
and
barbarians
but
as
neither
the
country
nor
the
people
were
of
great
interest
to
me
my
attention
was
centered
on
the
study
of
our
own
troops
meantime
the
unloading
of
our
steamers
had
begun
and
i
had
to
supervise
it
myself
as
the
cargoes
were
composed
of
perishable
foodstuffs
the
usual
delays
were
overcome
and
hundreds
of
sailors
and
soldiers
were
ordered
to
unload
the
ships
out
of
the
hold
rose
newly
slaughtered
pigs
and
sheep
and
ducks
which
were
at
once
distributed
among
the
various
regiments
two
hundred
barrels
of
the
best
munich
beer
were
rolled
over
the
quays
and
two
barrels
found
their
way
on
board
our
little
boat
which
no
one
could
begrudge
us
on
the
zaanstroom
there
were
boxes
of
fresh
eggs
each
box
containing
eggs
and
i
was
told
by
an
army
officer
that
every
man
of
the
northern
army
received
eight
eggs
for
the
easter
festival
on
the
following
afternoon
the
nationality
of
the
crew
and
of
the
passengers
was
recorded
a
number
of
them
were
sent
as
prisoners
of
war
to
concentration
camps
and
many
touching
farewells
ensued
between
the
men
and
the
women
who
were
left
behind
the
others
were
taken
on
a
special
train
under
military
guard
to
the
dutch
frontier
the
german
sailors
on
whom
this
mission
devolved
looked
very
jolly
as
they
sat
armed
to
the
teeth
in
the
railway
carriages
by
twos
watching
over
two
pretty
variety
actresses
and
i
think
they
would
willingly
have
prolonged
the
journey
farther
i
walked
along
the
train
to
say
goodbye
to
the
passengers
who
had
so
unwillingly
made
our
acquaintance
and
i
was
warmly
thanked
by
an
old
american
to
whom
i
personally
had
done
a
small
favor
for
my
courteous
treatment
he
spoke
in
the
name
of
all
the
passengers
who
had
experienced
also
the
greatest
civility
at
the
hands
of
the
port
authorities
i
declined
these
words
of
thanks
for
they
had
only
received
the
treatment
that
was
their
proper
due
after
the
train
had
left
the
hour
of
our
own
departure
had
struck
we
cast
off
the
lines
that
had
kept
us
bound
for
two
such
memorable
days
on
the
flemish
coast
in
passing
by
i
waved
a
farewell
to
the
two
dutch
captains
and
away
we
went
westward
ho
vii
off
the
coast
of
england
our
boat
carried
us
speedily
away
farther
and
farther
towards
the
west
and
soon
the
lighthouse
on
the
mole
and
the
outline
of
the
country
we
had
conquered
faded
away
in
the
evening
twilight
before
long
we
should
be
surrounded
by
only
hostile
shores
we
first
sighted
the
french
port
of
boulogne
where
the
imposing
bronze
statue
of
napoleon
i
stands
on
a
marble
column
meters
high
with
eyes
turned
towards
the
english
coast
it
was
built
to
commemorate
the
expedition
planned
by
napoleon
in
against
the
sons
of
albion
whose
descendants
have
so
recently
landed
on
french
soil
and
as
they
lie
there
encamped
they
may
wonder
when
gazing
at
the
statue
of
the
great
emperor
if
he
would
have
welcomed
them
with
the
same
enthusiasm
with
which
they
have
been
received
by
the
present
rulers
of
france
on
our
very
first
day
in
the
french
channel
we
were
able
to
sink
several
steamers
after
the
crews
had
left
in
their
lifeboats
and
on
general
lines
a
similar
picture
was
traced
at
every
sinking
we
were
now
granted
our
first
opportunity
to
steer
a
submarine
above
and
below
the
waters
of
the
north
atlantic
the
ocean
seemed
to
rejoice
at
our
coming
and
revealed
itself
to
us
in
all
the
glory
of
a
march
storm
only
those
who
have
seen
such
a
storm
can
realize
its
proud
majesty
the
gigantic
waves
with
their
shining
crests
lashed
by
the
west
wind
came
rushing
onwards
into
the
open
mouth
of
the
channel
and
the
waters
roaring
and
surging
dashed
themselves
against
the
sharp
rocky
points
of
the
french
coast
or
broke
less
violently
but
in
ceaseless
unrest
on
the
chalk
cliffs
of
england
which
glimmered
white
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
illustration
by
underwood
underwood
lifeboat
leaving
the
sinking
and
liner
arabia
it
is
a
splendid
sight
to
watch
this
great
spectacle
from
the
high
deck
of
a
steamer
as
it
ploughs
its
way
through
the
foaming
flood
or
to
be
borne
aloft
on
the
top
of
the
waves
with
a
ship
under
full
sail
but
it
is
still
more
wonderful
to
behold
nature
great
display
from
the
half
submerged
of
a
and
to
dive
through
the
mountainous
breakers
until
they
close
gurgling
over
our
heads
and
hide
us
from
all
curious
glances
our
little
nutshell
in
perpetual
motion
is
drawn
down
into
the
deep
valleys
of
the
ocean
waves
or
tossed
upwards
on
the
comb
of
the
following
breaker
we
are
soaked
to
the
skin
and
the
spray
covers
us
like
a
silvery
veil
our
boat
as
well
as
ourselves
is
daubed
with
a
salt
crust
our
eyes
smart
and
our
lips
have
a
briny
tang
but
to
us
sailors
it
a
joy
to
be
the
sport
of
the
wild
waves
and
even
those
few
unfortunates
who
always
suffer
from
never
lose
their
love
of
the
sea
we
were
thus
in
the
midst
of
a
strong
southwesterly
gale
lying
in
wait
for
our
prey
at
the
entrance
of
the
english
channel
but
no
ship
was
to
be
seen
most
of
them
took
the
northerly
course
beyond
the
war
zone
around
the
shetland
islands
and
it
was
not
until
the
next
morning
north
of
the
scilly
isles
in
the
bristol
channel
that
we
caught
sight
behind
us
of
a
big
steamer
running
before
the
wind
like
ourselves
the
wind
had
somewhat
fallen
and
the
march
sun
was
shining
bright
and
warm
the
steamer
was
heading
for
cardiff
and
we
judged
by
her
course
that
she
had
sailed
from
some
port
in
south
america
turning
about
and
breasting
the
waves
we
faced
the
oncoming
steamer
and
signaled
to
her
to
stop
but
hardly
had
she
espied
us
than
she
also
turned
about
in
the
hope
to
escape
she
showed
no
flag
to
indicate
her
nationality
so
surely
we
had
sighted
an
english
vessel
even
after
we
had
fired
a
warning
shot
she
tried
by
rapid
and
tortuous
curves
to
return
to
her
former
course
and
endeavor
thereby
to
reach
her
home
port
meantime
she
sent
up
rockets
as
signals
of
distress
in
quick
succession
to
draw
the
attention
of
british
patrol
ships
that
must
be
hovering
in
the
neighborhood
this
obliged
us
to
fire
a
decisive
shot
and
with
a
loud
report
our
first
shell
struck
the
ship
close
to
the
captain
bridge
instead
of
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
the
englishman
sent
up
more
signals
and
hoisted
the
british
flag
this
showed
us
he
was
game
and
the
fight
began
in
dead
earnest
all
honor
to
the
pluck
of
these
english
captains
but
how
reckless
to
expose
in
this
manner
the
lives
of
their
passengers
and
crew
as
we
shall
see
in
the
present
instance
circling
around
us
he
tried
to
ram
us
with
his
prow
and
we
naturally
avoided
him
by
also
turning
in
the
same
direction
every
time
he
veered
about
he
offered
us
his
broadside
for
a
shot
with
aim
we
took
advantage
of
this
target
and
our
successful
fire
gave
him
full
proof
of
the
skill
of
our
gunners
the
latter
had
a
hard
time
of
it
the
high
seas
poured
over
the
low
deck
and
they
continually
stood
up
to
their
necks
in
the
cold
salt
water
they
were
often
dragged
off
the
deck
by
the
great
receding
waves
but
as
they
were
tied
by
strong
ropes
to
the
cannons
we
were
able
to
pull
them
up
again
and
fortunately
no
lives
were
lost
on
seeing
our
gunners
struggling
in
the
seas
our
foe
hoped
to
make
good
his
escape
but
with
each
telling
shot
our
own
fighting
blood
was
aroused
and
the
wild
chase
continued
a
shell
tore
off
the
english
flagstaff
at
the
stern
but
the
union
jack
was
quickly
hoisted
again
on
the
foretop
this
was
also
shot
down
and
a
third
time
the
flag
flew
from
a
line
of
the
yard
of
the
foretop
but
the
flag
had
been
raised
too
hastily
and
it
hung
reversed
with
the
union
jack
upside
down
and
in
this
manner
it
continued
to
fly
until
it
sank
with
the
brave
ship
the
fight
had
lasted
four
hours
without
our
being
able
to
deliver
the
death
stroke
several
fires
had
started
on
the
steamer
but
the
crew
had
been
able
to
keep
them
under
control
big
holes
gaped
open
in
the
ship
side
but
there
were
none
as
yet
below
the
water
line
and
the
pumps
still
sufficed
to
expel
the
water
it
often
occurred
that
in
the
act
of
firing
the
waves
choked
our
cannons
and
the
shot
went
hissing
through
tremendous
sheets
of
water
while
we
were
blinded
by
a
deluge
of
foam
of
course
we
were
all
wet
through
and
through
but
that
was
of
no
importance
for
we
had
already
been
wet
for
days
it
was
now
essential
for
us
to
put
an
end
to
this
deadly
combat
for
english
destroyers
were
hurrying
on
to
the
calls
of
distress
of
the
steamer
big
clouds
of
smoke
against
the
sky
showed
they
were
coming
towards
us
under
full
steam
the
ship
was
by
this
time
listing
so
heavily
that
it
was
evident
we
need
waste
no
more
of
our
ammunition
and
besides
the
appearance
of
another
big
steamer
on
the
southern
horizon
was
an
enticing
inducement
to
quit
the
battle
scene
and
seek
another
victim
we
cast
a
last
look
on
our
courageous
adversary
who
was
gradually
sinking
and
i
must
add
it
was
the
first
and
last
prey
whose
end
we
did
not
have
the
satisfaction
to
witness
we
had
been
truly
impressed
by
the
captain
brave
endurance
notwithstanding
his
lack
of
wisdom
and
we
knew
that
the
were
coming
to
his
rescue
we
read
in
the
papers
on
our
return
to
a
german
port
that
the
vosges
had
sunk
soon
after
we
had
departed
and
what
remained
of
the
passengers
and
crew
were
picked
up
by
the
english
ships
the
captain
was
rewarded
for
his
temerity
by
being
raised
to
the
rank
of
reserve
officer
and
the
crew
were
given
sums
of
money
but
all
the
other
officers
had
perished
as
well
as
several
sailors
and
a
few
passengers
who
had
been
forced
to
help
the
stokers
in
order
to
increase
the
speed
of
the
flying
steamer
we
hurried
away
therefore
in
the
direction
of
the
other
ship
and
as
we
approached
we
soon
recognized
the
spanish
colors
flying
from
her
flagstaff
and
painted
on
her
sides
the
captain
willingly
stopped
at
our
bidding
and
dispatched
an
officer
to
us
bearing
the
ship
papers
the
stormy
waves
had
somewhat
subsided
and
although
the
occupants
of
the
boat
got
very
wet
yet
they
were
able
without
danger
to
come
alongside
our
submarine
there
was
no
contraband
on
board
the
spanish
steamer
and
before
dismissing
the
officer
i
admonished
him
always
to
stop
at
the
first
signal
from
a
he
assured
me
that
since
the
english
were
constantly
hoisting
the
spanish
flag
he
had
lost
all
desire
to
navigate
again
in
the
dangerous
waters
of
the
war
zone
much
relieved
at
getting
away
so
easily
he
went
on
board
his
own
steamer
which
resumed
its
voyage
towards
the
lovely
city
of
santander
on
the
spanish
coast
i
read
an
account
later
of
our
encounter
with
the
agustina
in
a
number
of
the
of
april
it
was
entitled
and
spoke
of
our
undesirable
presence
in
french
waters
a
following
number
did
us
the
honor
to
represent
a
large
picture
of
our
boat
with
the
officers
standing
on
the
bridge
taken
probably
by
a
passenger
on
board
the
spanish
vessel
an
arrow
pointed
to
us
with
the
inscription
de
the
english
usually
refer
to
us
as
the
pirates
and
in
their
rage
describe
our
activities
as
those
of
the
german
submarine
pest
we
are
accustomed
to
these
flattering
allusions
and
it
amused
me
to
preserve
and
frame
our
picture
from
the
in
the
next
few
days
we
stopped
and
searched
several
neutral
steamers
and
sank
many
english
ones
the
captains
were
occasionally
stubborn
and
refused
to
obey
our
signals
so
a
few
accidents
occurred
in
one
case
for
instance
a
stray
shot
struck
some
passengers
in
a
lifeboat
which
collapsed
but
as
a
rule
passengers
and
crews
were
picked
up
by
the
many
sailboats
and
fishing
boats
which
circulate
in
the
irish
sea
and
in
george
channel
and
it
was
we
who
generally
summoned
these
fishermen
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
their
shipwrecked
countrymen
the
method
of
capture
was
always
the
same
and
now
our
ammunition
being
nearly
exhausted
we
steered
a
homeward
course
with
the
hope
of
securing
a
few
more
steamers
on
the
way
we
were
again
favored
by
good
luck
for
at
the
entrance
of
the
english
channel
we
ran
across
a
large
steamer
coming
from
america
and
heading
for
a
french
port
heavily
laden
with
all
the
fine
things
that
the
americans
at
present
so
willingly
export
the
chase
began
in
the
usual
fashion
as
we
followed
closely
in
the
enemy
wake
although
the
captain
made
an
effort
to
escape
yet
he
evidently
felt
certain
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
be
unable
to
do
so
for
he
immediately
swung
out
the
lifeboats
ready
to
be
lowered
we
were
economizing
our
ammunition
and
did
not
according
to
our
custom
fire
a
warning
shot
but
as
we
drew
near
the
steamer
we
suddenly
saw
dark
round
objects
thrown
overboard
the
man
at
the
helm
beside
me
exclaimed
they
are
throwing
mines
but
i
was
not
of
the
same
opinion
we
proceeded
quietly
to
examine
these
suspicious
objects
more
closely
and
we
discovered
they
were
simply
bundles
of
clothes
the
sailors
were
trying
to
save
in
pitching
them
into
the
lifeboats
they
had
missed
the
mark
and
the
bundles
had
fallen
into
the
sea
a
report
had
apparently
spread
through
the
english
seaports
that
the
men
had
but
scant
time
to
save
their
belongings
when
they
were
sighted
by
one
of
our
submarines
and
since
that
time
their
clothes
were
strapped
together
ready
for
a
sudden
emergency
the
steamer
stopped
and
the
crew
on
this
occasion
took
to
the
boats
with
a
perfect
discipline
we
were
little
accustomed
to
witness
the
flaminian
was
sent
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
with
one
of
our
last
torpedoes
the
following
morning
before
bidding
the
west
coast
of
england
a
temporary
farewell
we
made
another
good
catch
we
sighted
a
steamer
also
coming
from
america
laden
down
as
we
soon
ascertained
with
tons
of
oats
and
making
its
way
to
havre
we
started
after
it
and
as
usual
it
tried
to
escape
but
a
shot
through
the
bridge
and
chart
house
brought
it
to
a
stop
and
it
signaled
that
the
engines
were
being
reversed
the
boats
were
lowered
and
on
drawing
near
we
perceived
the
captain
with
others
on
the
bridge
holding
up
their
hands
as
a
token
of
surrender
as
soon
as
those
on
board
had
taken
their
places
in
the
lifeboats
they
rowed
towards
us
and
showed
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
final
torpedoing
of
their
steamer
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
new
kind
of
sport
and
under
the
present
conditions
they
could
watch
the
performance
in
the
most
comfortable
way
the
sea
was
like
a
mirror
and
reflected
the
smiling
spring
sunshine
whose
warming
rays
were
most
agreeably
felt
the
english
captain
had
scarcely
been
on
board
my
submarine
a
moment
when
he
begged
that
we
might
go
together
and
verify
the
excellent
aim
of
our
first
shot
through
the
forward
part
of
his
ship
which
he
told
me
had
nearly
grazed
his
ear
i
consented
to
go
on
his
lifeboat
and
admire
with
him
to
our
mutual
enjoyment
the
irreproachable
marksmanship
of
my
gunner
although
i
did
not
accept
a
drink
of
whisky
one
of
the
english
officers
offered
me
on
seeing
the
gaping
hole
in
the
forecastle
the
captain
and
his
men
clapped
their
hands
and
cried
out
a
very
good
shot
the
captain
congratulated
me
for
securing
as
he
asserted
the
richest
prize
i
had
ever
made
but
i
assured
him
we
had
sunk
even
more
valuable
cargoes
than
the
present
one
i
decided
as
the
sea
was
calm
and
no
ship
was
in
sight
to
spare
our
torpedoes
and
shells
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
steamer
with
little
hand
grenades
the
englishmen
took
a
sportsmanlike
interest
in
the
proceedings
and
one
of
the
officers
even
volunteered
to
show
me
the
most
effective
position
for
the
explosive
i
naturally
did
not
gratify
his
wish
to
place
it
there
himself
for
i
knew
myself
very
accurately
the
most
vulnerable
spot
in
the
ship
in
a
very
few
moments
a
big
hole
was
torn
in
the
side
of
the
crown
of
castille
and
with
a
gurgling
sound
the
waters
rushed
in
at
the
same
time
long
yellow
threads
of
the
finest
oats
floated
far
out
on
the
sea
and
glistening
with
a
golden
shimmer
gave
proof
long
after
the
steamer
had
sunk
of
the
precious
cargo
which
had
lain
within
its
flanks
you
poor
french
army
horses
i
fear
your
rations
were
cut
short
for
a
while
i
had
made
an
interesting
study
of
the
manner
in
which
the
english
crews
of
the
present
day
were
composed
apart
from
the
british
officers
there
were
but
few
experienced
seamen
on
board
this
was
made
evident
by
the
awkward
way
the
men
usually
handled
the
lifeboats
even
with
the
enormous
increase
of
wages
sailors
could
not
be
found
to
risk
their
lives
in
the
danger
zone
and
a
lot
of
untrained
fellows
negroes
and
chinamen
revealed
by
their
clumsy
rowing
that
they
had
only
recently
been
pressed
into
service
various
other
interesting
incidents
occurred
on
our
return
trip
which
i
shall
not
mention
now
but
having
safely
reached
our
newly
conquered
port
of
ostend
we
read
to
our
amusement
in
a
french
paper
that
our
had
been
sunk
in
the
channel
by
a
fleet
of
six
fishing
steamers
we
were
again
warmly
welcomed
by
our
comrades
from
the
army
and
navy
all
anxious
to
hear
the
news
we
had
to
tell
and
we
had
the
special
honor
of
a
visit
from
the
crown
prince
rupprecht
of
bavaria
who
after
inspecting
our
boat
permitted
me
to
give
him
a
detailed
account
of
our
recent
splendid
cruise
we
had
many
other
experiences
during
the
quiet
warm
summer
months
with
their
long
clear
nights
which
enabled
us
to
achieve
the
further
destruction
of
a
large
number
of
steamers
it
was
glorious
to
work
in
fine
weather
on
our
on
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
ocean
so
peaceful
at
this
season
of
the
year
and
so
doing
we
indulged
in
much
friendly
intercourse
with
the
various
fishermen
we
met
fishing
steamers
have
replaced
the
old
sailboats
to
a
great
extent
and
they
represent
an
enormous
fishing
industry
our
larder
was
daily
replenished
with
fresh
fish
which
was
a
greatly
appreciated
item
on
our
monotonous
bill
of
fare
one
windy
evening
in
august
we
captured
a
belgian
steamer
bringing
home
coal
from
cardiff
the
crew
having
left
the
ship
the
latter
was
rapidly
sinking
when
to
our
astonishment
a
man
sprang
on
deck
from
below
he
had
evidently
been
forgotten
and
our
shot
going
through
the
steamer
had
warned
him
of
his
danger
he
hesitated
to
obey
my
repeated
orders
to
jump
overboard
until
finally
encased
in
two
life
belts
he
plunged
into
the
water
and
began
to
swim
but
the
screw
was
still
slowly
revolving
and
he
was
drawn
deep
down
by
the
suction
of
the
water
we
had
given
him
up
as
lost
when
we
were
amazed
to
see
him
reappear
on
the
other
side
of
the
ship
the
screw
which
had
slowly
pulled
him
down
had
thrown
him
up
again
and
he
swam
towards
us
a
big
wave
having
tossed
him
onto
our
low
deck
we
were
glad
to
find
he
was
unhurt
and
we
gave
him
the
best
of
care
he
was
a
dutchman
and
after
a
fortnight
spent
in
our
midst
he
was
so
happy
he
no
longer
wished
to
leave
us
when
it
came
to
our
sinking
of
the
midland
queen
a
similar
incident
occurred
a
negro
had
been
forgotten
by
his
white
and
on
finding
himself
abandoned
and
alone
he
was
so
greatly
scared
that
he
did
not
dare
to
leave
the
sinking
ship
we
watched
him
and
beckoned
to
him
to
come
to
us
but
he
refused
and
swore
at
us
furiously
presently
the
midland
queen
pitched
violently
forward
and
stood
nearly
erect
with
her
nose
in
the
water
then
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
she
dived
below
the
surface
of
the
waves
the
black
head
vanished
in
the
turmoil
of
the
waters
then
suddenly
a
loud
detonation
occurred
an
explosion
of
compressed
air
within
the
ship
threw
up
barrels
and
boards
and
among
them
to
our
unbelieving
eyes
we
saw
the
wriggling
body
of
the
negro
he
was
projected
into
the
sea
and
swam
towards
us
apparently
none
the
worse
after
this
strange
and
violent
experience
we
rescued
him
and
handed
him
over
to
his
mates
who
had
rowed
back
to
his
assistance
on
our
return
voyage
through
the
north
sea
we
met
a
large
sailboat
with
the
swedish
flag
flying
from
the
topmast
she
lay
completely
becalmed
and
signaled
for
us
to
draw
near
we
saw
a
large
crowd
gathered
on
her
deck
and
we
approached
cautiously
fearing
some
trap
when
to
our
joyful
surprise
we
found
she
had
german
officers
and
sailors
on
board
they
belonged
to
one
of
our
auxiliary
cruisers
the
meteor
her
captain
after
many
exploits
had
been
pursued
by
several
english
cruisers
and
to
save
his
little
vessel
from
being
captured
he
had
deliberately
sent
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
the
swedish
sailboat
had
picked
up
the
crew
our
shipwrecked
comrades
told
us
they
were
desperately
hungry
but
our
own
provisions
were
exhausted
so
we
took
them
in
tow
for
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
sails
by
clear
sunshine
we
merrily
covered
the
short
distance
to
our
nearest
port
and
towards
midday
the
sailing
ship
and
ourselves
let
down
our
anchors
once
more
off
the
german
coast
viii
the
method
of
sinking
and
raising
ships
during
the
present
naval
warfare
we
have
had
the
opportunity
to
watch
the
sinking
of
ships
of
every
type
and
size
shortly
after
receiving
their
death
wound
the
vessels
usually
disappear
totally
beneath
the
surface
it
takes
even
big
steamers
only
between
four
and
ten
minutes
to
sink
after
being
hit
by
a
torpedo
or
shell
beneath
the
water
line
and
yet
occasionally
a
ship
may
float
several
hours
before
going
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
it
is
clearly
evident
that
the
slow
or
rapid
sinking
of
a
ship
depends
on
the
distribution
of
its
bulkheads
and
compartments
a
built
on
the
latest
models
has
a
great
many
small
compartments
for
she
is
meant
to
be
able
to
continue
fighting
even
after
several
of
these
compartments
have
been
destroyed
whereas
an
ocean
steamer
is
so
constructed
that
she
will
remain
afloat
only
a
short
time
after
a
collision
with
another
ship
or
if
she
runs
into
an
iceberg
or
a
derelict
she
can
endure
a
certain
intake
of
water
and
lists
at
a
moderate
angle
far
more
readily
than
a
warship
whose
guns
are
rendered
nearly
useless
if
the
ship
is
heavily
canting
a
warship
must
be
built
so
as
to
withstand
without
sinking
the
injury
caused
by
a
number
of
gun
holes
even
beneath
the
water
line
where
the
inner
part
of
the
ship
must
necessarily
be
subdivided
into
many
parts
a
warship
is
built
at
great
cost
but
so
is
an
ocean
steamer
the
sunken
lusitania
was
worth
marks
nearly
and
the
mammoth
steamers
of
the
line
the
imperator
the
vaterland
were
still
more
expensive
to
build
the
ordinary
commercial
steamer
often
has
in
her
inner
construction
only
athwartship
bulkheads
through
the
double
bottom
that
run
from
one
side
to
another
and
form
large
partitions
and
in
proportion
to
her
height
a
steamer
is
again
subdivided
horizontally
into
several
decks
but
these
are
not
usually
and
the
cross
bulkheads
already
mentioned
form
the
only
divisions
in
the
hold
in
the
big
cargo
spaces
these
divisions
practically
do
not
exist
and
the
ship
throughout
almost
its
whole
interior
is
open
from
keel
to
deck
this
arrangement
of
course
facilitates
the
rapid
loading
and
unloading
of
the
cargo
therefore
in
this
type
of
ship
the
engine
rooms
and
boilers
surrounded
and
protected
by
coal
bunkers
are
the
only
really
portions
of
the
ship
whoever
has
gazed
down
into
the
capacious
hold
of
such
a
steamer
will
readily
understand
that
if
the
water
should
pour
into
one
of
these
spaces
at
either
end
of
the
ship
the
other
end
of
the
vessel
would
rise
steadily
upwards
in
nearly
every
case
even
the
largest
steamer
just
before
sinking
tilts
abruptly
its
bow
or
stern
straight
up
out
of
the
sea
until
the
water
rushing
into
the
hold
draws
the
vessel
downwards
and
with
a
mighty
roar
it
plunges
forever
into
the
deep
we
have
repeatedly
noticed
at
this
moment
that
the
air
within
the
boat
escapes
with
a
shrill
whistle
from
every
possible
aperture
and
the
sound
resembles
the
shriek
of
a
steam
siren
this
is
a
wonderful
spectacle
to
behold
the
velocity
with
which
a
ship
sinks
depends
on
the
size
of
the
hold
and
its
distance
from
the
ship
center
of
gravity
for
the
suction
occurs
more
rapidly
if
the
ship
is
struck
at
either
end
than
if
the
blow
is
delivered
amidships
we
are
seldom
concerned
with
ships
having
empty
holds
those
we
pursue
usually
carry
heavy
cargoes
and
therefore
the
water
can
only
penetrate
within
where
space
and
air
exist
whatever
air
is
left
around
loosely
packed
bales
and
boxes
must
be
driven
out
before
the
water
can
stream
in
certain
exceptional
cargoes
like
wool
and
cereals
absorb
a
given
amount
of
water
but
these
can
be
discounted

british

ship

cross
on
bow
sunk
in
the
english
channel
by
a
german
submarine
accordingly
the
air
must
escape
through
existing
holes
as
the
water
pouring
in
drives
the
air
into
the
hold
the
pressure
with
which
the
water
comes
in
is
equal
to
the
air
pressure
in
the
hold
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
cargo
may
be
so
closely
packed
that
there
will
be
no
space
left
for
air
to
escape
but
this
is
hardly
ever
the
case
frequently
however
the
of
the
air
vents
are
so
small
that
the
air
escapes
only
very
slowly
and
the
water
enters
very
slowly
in
the
same
ratio
under
these
conditions
it
would
take
a
long
time
for
a
ship
to
sink
this
undoubtedly
is
very
desirable
in
peace
time
but
in
time
of
war
this
is
not
at
all
agreeable
to
our
purpose
first
if
the
foundering
of
the
vessel
is
prolonged
we
are
prevented
from
accomplishing
other
work
and
secondly
warships
may
come
to
the
assistance
of
a
sinking
steamer
whenever
possible
we
found
it
expedient
to
break
open
with
an
axe
big
holes
in
the
lockers
in
case
the
hatch
could
not
be
quickly
enough
removed
or
if
circumstances
did
not
permit
of
our
doing
this
we
shot
holes
with
our
cannon
into
the
upper
part
of
the
steamer
above
the
hold
so
that
the
air
might
conveniently
escape
and
the
water
rush
in
we
employed
with
excellent
results
this
method
in
the
sinking
of
many
steamers
which
otherwise
would
have
settled
too
slowly
it
happens
sometimes
that
a
ship
may
carry
a
cargo
that
floats
and
that
is
not
porous
such
as
wood
it
is
impossible
to
sink
a
vessel
with
such
a
cargo
by
admitting
water
into
the
hold
shots
therefore
must
be
fired
at
the
engine
and
boiler
rooms
to
force
this
kind
of
a
steamer
to
sink
in
general
this
is
a
safe
rule
to
follow
for
these
are
always
the
most
vulnerable
portions
of
every
heavily
laden
vessel
and
this
mode
of
attack
is
nearly
invariably
successful
a
warship
is
usually
equipped
with
cross
or
lateral
bulkheads
in
addition
to
the
longitudinal
bulkhead
that
runs
from
stem
to
stern
through
the
middle
of
the
ship
dividing
it
into
halves
and
other
bulkheads
separate
these
two
longitudinal
sections
into
further
subdivisions
with
the
exception
of
the
great
fast
passenger
steamers
these
divisions
by
means
of
longitudinal
bulkheads
seldom
exist
on
vessels
of
commerce
although
exceptions
are
to
be
found
the
sinking
of
a
steamer
with
a
multitude
of
partitions
is
effected
by
its
gradually
listing
more
and
more
on
the
side
in
which
the
water
is
penetrating
until
it
capsizes
completely
and
founders
with
the
keel
uppermost
a
ship
can
also
roll
over
on
its
side
as
it
plunges
downwards
with
stem
or
stern
erect
theoretically
a
vessel
might
sink
on
a
parallel
keel
descending
horizontally
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
sea
but
it
never
occurs
in
reality
this
hypothesis
assumes
that
a
ship
has
taken
in
at
the
bow
exactly
the
same
amount
of
water
as
at
the
stern
at
exactly
the
same
distance
from
the
center
of
gravity
this
of
course
is
impossible
besides
the
holes
through
which
the
water
is
pouring
in
must
also
be
at
precisely
the
same
level
or
else
the
water
pressure
would
be
greater
at
one
end
than
at
the
other
and
the
slightest
alteration
of
level
would
occasion
a
greater
intake
of
water
and
upset
the
equilibrium
of
the
boat
there
is
one
other
point
i
will
touch
upon
it
has
often
been
asserted
especially
in
romances
of
the
ocean
that
as
a
ship
sinks
the
suction
creates
a
tremendous
whirlpool
which
engulfs
all
things
in
its
vicinity
this
statement
is
naturally
very
much
exaggerated
people
swimming
about
may
be
drawn
down
by
the
suction
of
the
foundering
ship
but
in
my
opinion
no
lifeboat
which
is
well
manned
is
in
danger
of
this
whirlpool
even
old
sailors
deluded
by
this
superstition
have
rowed
away
in
haste
from
a
sinking
ship
when
they
might
have
stood
by
and
saved
many
lives
the
question
is
now
often
being
put
whether
it
will
be
possible
to
raise
the
vessels
that
have
been
sunk
during
the
war
the
raising
of
a
ship
depends
above
all
upon
whether
the
depth
at
which
it
lies
is
so
great
that
it
precludes
the
work
of
a
diver
i
have
already
stated
that
the
water
pressure
augments
at
the
rate
of
one
atmosphere
one
kilogram
to
the
square
centimeter
to
ten
increase
of
depth
if
a
diver
working
at
ten
meters
depth
is
under
a
pressure
of
one
atmosphere
at
fifty
meters
he
will
be
under
the
tremendous
pressure
of
five
atmospheres
this
is
the
greatest
depth
to
which
a
diver
can
attain
and
if
by
chance
a
diver
has
gone
a
few
meters
beyond
fifty
meters
no
man
to
my
knowledge
has
attained
sixty
meters
the
work
of
divers
at
a
depth
of
forty
or
fifty
meters
is
even
then
not
very
effective
as
they
are
unable
to
perform
heavy
tasks
nor
can
they
remain
more
than
half
an
hour
at
a
time
under
such
a
pressure
and
i
am
speaking
now
only
of
experts
therefore
only
light
and
easy
work
can
be
performed
by
most
divers
at
a
great
depth
and
the
appliance
of
ponderous
chains
for
lifting
purposes
can
only
be
accomplished
under
unusually
favorable
conditions
to
raise
any
ship
at
a
depth
above
thirty
meters
must
be
considered
as
a
very
efficient
job
whereas
if
this
is
attempted
at
a
depth
below
thirty
meters
it
can
be
done
only
by
salvage
companies
where
neither
unfavorable
bottom
obstacles
nor
currents
intervene
a
strong
current
renders
a
work
impossible
for
it
carries
him
off
his
feet
on
the
high
seas
the
currents
change
with
the
ebb
and
flood
at
the
precise
moment
of
the
turn
of
the
tide
the
undercurrent
is
supposed
to
be
nil
and
the
diver
must
take
advantage
of
this
moment
to
perform
his
task
another
difficulty
arises
from
the
sand
being
shifted
by
the
currents
and
settling
on
the
prominent
parts
of
a
wreck
it
often
envelops
them
to
such
a
degree
that
the
ship
becomes
so
deeply
embedded
in
the
sand
that
it
is
no
longer
salvable
according
to
my
estimation
eighty
per
cent
of
our
enemy
sunken
ships
lie
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
meters
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
so
that
all
possibility
of
their
being
raised
is
excluded
the
largest
ships
nowadays
have
a
draft
of
less
than
ten
meters
and
as
the
vessels
sunk
lie
at
far
greater
depths
they
are
no
source
of
danger
to
shipping
in
time
of
peace
of
the
remaining
twenty
per
cent
of
sunken
ships
half
of
them
are
unreclaimable
either
owing
to
their
position
or
owing
to
the
high
cost
of
salvage
or
because
it
is
not
even
known
where
they
lie
the
other
half
or
last
ten
per
cent
have
probably
for
the
greater
part
been
sunk
in
channels
where
the
currents
are
so
swift
that
they
are
covered
with
sand
and
diving
enterprises
are
out
of
the
question
in
time
of
war
such
work
can
not
be
thought
of
after
the
war
the
ships
will
long
since
have
been
completely
buried
by
the
sand
maybe
off
the
east
coast
of
england
one
or
two
ships
may
be
raised
for
they
lie
at
a
lesser
depth
and
are
exposed
to
slighter
currents
than
on
the
south
coast
of
england
but
in
that
district
only
the
smaller
and
more
insignificant
vessels
have
been
sunk
and
it
would
hardly
pay
to
raise
them
especially
as
they
are
so
damaged
by
torpedoes
and
mines
that
they
would
probably
fall
apart
on
being
raised
to
the
surface
therefore
hardly
a
single
ship
will
be
salvaged
and
the
sea
will
retain
all
those
ships
it
has
swallowed
in
the
course
of
this
war
carried
on
by
all
the
