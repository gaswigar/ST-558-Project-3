girls
girls
everywhere
girls
in
the
passages
girls
in
the
hall
racing
upstairs
and
scurrying
downstairs
diving
into
dormitories
and
running
into
classrooms
overflowing
on
to
the
landing
and
hustling
along
the
corridor
everywhere
girls
there
were
tall
and
short
and
fat
and
thin
and
all
degrees
from
pretty
to
plain
girls
with
fair
hair
and
girls
with

hair
and
girls
demure
girls
romping
girls
clever
girls
stupid
girls
but
never
a
silent
girl
no
the
talk
and
chatter
surged
in
a
full
steady
flow
round
the
house
till
the
noise
invaded
even
that
sanctuary
of
sanctuaries
the
private
study
where
miss
birks
the
principal
sat
addressing
post
cards
to
inform
respective
parents
of
the
safe
arrival
of
the
various
individual
members
of
the
frolicsome
crew
which
had
just
reassembled
after
the
christmas
vacation
in
ordinary
circumstances
such
an
indiscretion
as
squealing
on
the
stairs
or
dancing
in
the
passages
would
have
brought
miss
birks
from
her
den
dealing
out
stern
rebukes
if
not
visiting
dire
justice
on
the
offenders
but
for
this
one
brief
evening
the
first
night
of
the
term
the
old
house
was
liberty
hall
each
damsel
did
what
seemed
good
in
her
own
eyes
and
talked
laughed
and
joked
to
her
heart
content
let
them
fizz
poor
dears
said
miss
birks
smiling
to
herself
as
a
special
outburst
of
mirth
was
wafted
up
from
below
it
does
them
good
to
work
off
steam
when
they
arrive
they
have
to
be
quiet
enough
really
the
twenty
make
noise
enough
for
a
hundred
all
on
power
shades
of
the
franciscans
what
a
noise
it
seems
almost
sacrilege
in
an
old
convent
if
indeed
the
gentle
nuns
who
long
long
ago
had
stolen
silently
along
those
very
same
stairs
could
have
come
back
to
survey
the
scene
of
their
former
activities
i
fear
on
this
particular
occasion
they
would
have
wrung
their
slim
transparent
hands
in
horror
over
the
stalwart
modern
maidens
who
had
succeeded
them
in
possession
of
the
ancient
rambling
house
no
novices
these
with
downcast
eyes
and
cheeks
sunken
with
fasting
no
timid
glances
no
soft
ethereal
footfalls
or
gliding
garments
the
old
order
had
changed
indeed
and
yielded
place
to
a
rosy
racy
healthy
hearty
set
of
schoolgirls
overflowing
with
vigorous
young
life
and
abounding
spirits
mentally
and
physically
fit
and
about
as
different
from
their
mediaeval
forerunners
as
a
hockey
stick
is
from
a
spindle
among
the
jolly
careless
company
that
on
this
january
evening
held
carnival
in
the
vaulted
passages
and
woke
the
echoes
of
the
walls
no
two
had
abandoned
themselves
to
the
fun
of
the
moment
more
thoroughly
than
deirdre
sullivan
and
dulcie
wilcox
they
had
attempted
to
dance
five
varieties
of
fancy
steps
on
an
upper
landing
had
performed
a
species
of
highland
fling
down
the
stairs
and
had
finished
with
an
irregular
along
the
lower
corridor
subsiding
finally
scarlet
with
their
exertions
and
wellnigh
voiceless
on
to
the
bottom
step
of
the
back
staircase
oh
let
sit
here
and
talk
heaved
deirdre
her
power
of
speech
returning
in
jerks
i
tired
of
ragging
round
and
i
not
seen
you
for
ages
and
oh
there
such
heaps
and
heaps
to
tell
look
she
over
there
who
queried
dulcie
laconically
she
was
stouter
than
deirdre
and
like
hamlet
scant
of
breath
why
she
of
course
do
be
a
lunatic
which
she
and
what
she
and
why
she
of
all
shes
gasped
dulcie
still
rather
convulsively
and
painfully
what
could
i
possibly
mean
except
the
new
girl
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
there
a
new
girl
you
do
surely
mean
to
tell
me
you
never
noticed
her
you
blind
bat
why
there
she
is
as
large
as
life
ca
you
see
her
stupid
the
atrocious
part
of
it
is
she
been
stuck
into
our
bedroom
dulcie
sprang
up
with
hands
outstretched
in
utter
tragedy
no
she
wailed
oh
no
no
surely
miss
birks
has
been
heartless
enough
to
fill
up
that
spare
bed
oh
i
never
forgive
her
never
our
ducky
chummy
little
room
to
be
invaded
by
a
third
and
a
stranger
sheer
barbarous
cruelty
oh
i
thought
better
of
her
what
have
we
done
to
be
treated
like
this
it
pure
and
simple
brutality
who
the
lunatic
now
stop
ranting
you
goose
that
bed
was
bound
to
be
filled
some
day
though
it
hard
luck
on
us
we
did
pretty
well
to
keep
the
place
to
ourselves
the
whole
of
last
term
good
things
come
to
an
end
i
trying
to
be
philosophical
and
quote
proverbs
all
the
same
company
and
three
trumpery
that
a
proverb
too
you
have
told
me
yet
what
you
think
of
our
number
three
talking
to
mademoiselle
over
there
so
she
is
why
if
she
is
talking
german
too
as
pat
as
a
native
what
a
tremendous
rate
their
tongues
are
going
at
it
i
ca
catch
a
single
word
is
she
a
foreigner
she
does
somehow
quite
suggest
english
by
the
look
of
her
does
she
the
new
girl
in
question
the
interloper
who
was
to
form
the
unwelcome
third
and
spoil
the
delightful
à
hitherto
so
keenly
enjoyed
by
the
chums
certainly
had
a
rather
aspect
when
viewed
even
by
impartial
eyes
her
colouring
blue
eyes
and
her
very
fair
flaxen
hair
were
distinctly
teutonic
the
cut
of
her
dress
the
shape
of
her
shoes
the
tiny
satchel
slung
by
a
strap
round
her
shoulder
and
under
one
arm
so
unmistakably
german
in
type
the
enamelled
locket
bearing
the
prussian
eagle
on
a
blue
ground
all
showed
a
slightly
appreciable
difference
from
her
companions
and
stamped
her
emphatically
with
the
seal
and
signet
of
the
vaterland
on
the
whole
she
might
be
considered
a
decidedly
pretty
girl
her
features
were
small
and
clear
cut
her
complexion
beyond
reproach
her
teeth
even
her
fair
hair
glossy
and
she
was
moderately
tall
for
her
fifteen
years
dulcie
took
in
all
these
points
with
a
long
long
comprehensive
stare
then
subsided
on
to
the
top
of
the
boot
rack
shaking
her
head
gloomily
you
may
call
it
british
prejudice
but
i
ca
stand
foreigners
she
remarked
with
a
gusty
sigh
as
for
having
one
in
one
bedroom
why
it
wicked
miss
birks
ought
to
expect
it
foreigners
who
talking
about
foreigners
asked
marcia
richards
one
of
the
sixth
form
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
the
moment
and
overheard
dulcie
complaints
if
you
mean
gerda
thorwaldson
she
is
as
english
as
you
or
i
english
listen
to
her
pattering
german
thirteen
to
the
dozen
snorted
dulcie
you
young
john
bull
do
be
insular
and
ridiculous
gerda
has
lived
in
germany
so
of
course
she
can
speak
german
it
will
be
very
good
practice
for
you
to
talk
it
with
her
in
your
bedroom
if
you
think
we
going
to
break
our
jaws
with
those
abominable
gutturals
broke
out
deirdre
miss
germany
have
to
compass
english
or
hold
her
tongue
added
dulcie
do
be
nasty
you
wasting
your
opportunities
if
i
had
your
chance
i
soon
improve
my
german
why
did
miss
birks
put
her
with
you
instead
chimed
the
injured
pair
in
chorus
you
welcome
to
our
share
of
her
come
along
you
slackers
interrupted
evie
bennett
and
annie
pridwell
emerging
from
the
you
wasting
time
here
betty
playing
for
all
she
worth
and
everybody
got
to
come
and
dance
pass
the
word
on
if
anyone
upstairs
are
you
ready
hurry
up
then
oh
i
say
i
tired
yawned
dulcie
we
had
enough
of
the
light
fantastic
toe
protested
deirdre
little
birds
that
can
hop
and
wo
hop
must
be
made
to
hop
chirped
evie
firmly
how
you
make
us
the
mogul
has
decreed
that
any
girl
who
refuses
to
dance
shall
be
forcibly
placed
upon
the
table
and
obliged
to
sing
a
solo
or
forfeit
all
the
sweets
she
may
have
brought
back
with
her
is
kismet
murmured
deirdre
hauling
up
dulcie
from
the
boot
rack
no
use
fighting
against
one
fate
sighed
dulcie
linking
arms
with
her
chum
as
she
walked
along
the
passage
after
all
it
was
only
the
younger
members
who
were
assembled
in
the
the
sixth
far
too
superior
to
join
in
the
general
romping
were
having
a
select
cocoa
party
in
the
head
girl
bedroom
and
telling
each
other
that
the
noise
below
was
disgraceful
and
they
wondered
miss
birks
did
put
a
stop
to
it
at
seventeen
one
judgment
is
apt
to
be
severe
especially
on
those
only
a
few
years
younger
miss
birks
however
who
was
and
wise
in
her
generation
did
not
interfere
and
the
fun
downstairs
continued
to
effervesce
betty
scott
seated
at
the
piano
played
with
skill
and
zeal
and
the
others
were
soon
tripping
their
steps
with
more
or
less
effect
according
to
their
individual
grace
and
agility
all
but
two
hilda
marriott
had
strained
her
ankle
during
the
holidays
and
could
only
sit
on
the
table
and
sigh
with
envy
while
gerda
thorwaldson
the
new
girl
stood
by
the
door
watching
the
performance
everybody
was
so
taken
up
by
the
joys
of
the
moment
that
nobody
realized
her
presence
even
when
whirling
skirts
whisked
against
her
in
passing
not
a
single
one
noticed
her
forlorn
aloofness
or
that
the
blue
eyes
were
almost
brimming
over
with
tears
mademoiselle
the
only
person
who
had
so
far
befriended
her
had
beaten
a
retreat
and
was
finishing
unpacking
while
the
fourteen
fellow
pupils
in
the
room
were
still
entire
strangers
to
her
as
nobody
made
the
slightest
overture
towards
an
introduction
and
she
seemed
rather
in
the
way
of
the
dancers
gerda
opened
the
door
and
was
about
to
follow
mademoiselle
example
and
make
her
escape
upstairs
her
action
however
attracted
the
attention
that
had
before
been
denied
her
hallo
the
new
girl
sneaking
off
cried
annie
pridwell
pausing
so
suddenly
that
she
almost
upset
her
partner
here
stop
where
are
you
going
you
got
to
stay
come
here
and
report
yourself
the
dancing
had
come
to
a
brief
and
sudden
end
betty
scott
concluding
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
turned
round
on
the
music
stool
and
holding
up
a
commanding
finger
beckoned
the
stranger
forward
let
have
a
look
at
you
she
remarked
patronizingly
i
had
time
to
take
you
in
before
are
you
really
german
tell
us
about
yourself
yes
go
on
where
do
you
come
from
and
all
the
rest
of
it
urged
evie
bennett
are
you
dumb
asked
rhoda
wilkins
perhaps
she
ca
speak
english
sniggered
dulcie
wilcox
gerda
thorwaldson
now
the
target
of
every
eye
had
turned
crimson
to
the
very
roots
of
her
flaxen
hair
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
ring
of
new
schoolfellows
so
overwhelmed
with
shyness
that
she
did
not
volunteer
a
single
response
to
the
volley
of
remarks
suddenly
fired
at
her
this
did
not
at
all
content
her
inquisitors
who
once
their
attention
was
drawn
to
her
felt
their
curiosity
aroused
i
say
why
ca
you
speak
said
barbara
marshall
nudging
her
elbow
you
need
look
so
scared
we
not
going
to
eat
you
no
cannibals
here
piped
romola
harvey
lost
stolen
or
strayed
a
tongue
the
property
of
the
new
girl
finder
will
be
handsomely
rewarded
remarked
mary
beckett
facetiously
you
got
to
answer
some
questions
gerda
thorwaldson
i
suppose
that
your
name
so
do
be
silly
urged
irene
jordan
speak
up
we
sha
stand
any
nonsense
added
elyned
hughes
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
murmured
gerda
gulping
down
her
embarrassment
with
something
suspiciously
like
a
sob
and
blinking
her
blue
eyes
rapidly
oh
you
can
talk
english
well
to
begin
with
are
you
german
or
not
no
but
you
come
from
germany
yes
have
you
ever
been
in
cornwall
before
never
i
suppose
you
can
dance
no
at
this
last
negative
a
united
howl
went
up
from
the
assembled
circle
ca
dance
where
have
you
lived
make
her
try
she
got
to
learn
take
her
arm
and
teach
her
some
steps
she
wo
she
have
to
no
one
to
be
let
off
gerda
thorwaldson
said
evie
bennett
impressively
we
give
you
your
choice
you
either
try
to
dance
this
very
instant
or
you
stand
on
that
table
and
sing
a
song
in
english
mind
not
german
which
will
you
choose
clamoured
three
or
four
urgent
voices
oh
i
say
it
too
bad
to
rag
her
so
just
at
first
protested
doris
patterson
a
shade
more
sympathetic
than
the
rest
not
a
bit
of
it
if
she
really
english
she
must
show
it
and
if
she
wo
she
nothing
but
a
foreigner
blustered
dulcie
wilcox
this
is
easy
enough
volunteered
annie
pridwell
performing
a
few
steps
by
way
of
encouragement
now
come
along
and
do
as
i
do
fly
little
birdie
fly
mocked
betty
scott
she
too
stupid
she
going
to
blub
leave
her
alone
no
make
her
dance
do
let
her
sneak
out
of
it
i
say
what
going
on
here
said
a
fresh
voice
as
marcia
richards
entered
the
room
and
after
pausing
a
moment
to
take
in
the
situation
strode
indignantly
to
the
rescue
of
poor
gerda
who
still
shy
and
with
so
many
questions
stood
almost
weeping
in
the
midst
of
the
circle
is
this
the
way
you
treat
a
new
girl
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
no
she
sha
learn
to
dance
if
she
does
want
to
not
at
any
rate
come
along
with
me
gerda
and
have
some
cocoa
upstairs
do
trouble
your
head
about
this
noisy
set
if
they
no
better
manners
i
sorry
for
them
with
which
parting
shot
she
seized
her
protégée
by
the
arm
and
bore
her
out
of
the
room
most
of
the
girls
laughed
they
did
not
take
the
affair
seriously
a
fit
of
bashfulness
and
blushing
might
be
very
agonizing
to
the
but
it
was
distinctly
diverting
to
outsiders
new
girls
must
expect
a
little
wholesome
catechizing
before
they
were
admitted
into
the
bosom
of
their
form
it
was

chapter
ii
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
please
do
not
think
because
miss
birks
pupils
on
the
first
night
of
a
new
term
ran
up
and
down
the
passages
and
insisted
on
compulsory
dancing
or
solo
singing
that
this
was
their
normal
course
of
procedure
it
was
but
their
one
evening
of
liberty
before
they
settled
down
to
ordinary
school
routine
and
for
the
rest
of
the
days
before
easter
their
behaviour
would
be
quite
exemplary
they
were
a
very
happy
little
community
at
the
dower
house
they
admired
and
respected
their
headmistress
and
her
rules
were
rarely
transgressed
certainly
the
girls
would
have
been
hard
to
please
if
they
had
not
been
satisfied
with
miss
birks
for
allied
to
her
undoubted
brain
power
she
had
those
far
rarer
gifts
of
perfect
tact
and
absolute
sympathy
she
thoroughly
understood
that
riddle
the
mind
of
a
schoolgirl
and
while
still
keeping
her
authority
and
maintaining
the
dignity
of
her
position
could
win
her
pupils
entire
confidence
almost
as
if
she
had
been
one
of
themselves
miss
birks
never
seems
to
have
quite
grown
up
she
enjoys
things
just
the
same
as
we
do
was
the
general
verdict
of
the
school
perhaps
a
strain
of
irish
in
her
genealogy
had
given
the
principal
the
pleasant
twinkle
in
her
eye
the
racy
humour
of
speech
and
the
sunny
optimistic
view
of
life
so
dearly
valued
by
all
who
knew
her
anyhow
whatever
ancestry
might
claim
to
be
the
source
of
her
cheery
attributes
she
had
a
very
winning
personality
and
ruled
her
small
kingdom
with
a
hand
so
light
that
few
realized
its
firmness
and
a
kingdom
it
was
in
the
girls
opinion
a
veritable
kingdom
by
the
sea
no
place
in
all
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
british
isles
so
they
considered
could
in
any
way
compare
with
it
together
with
the
old
castle
for
which
it
formed
the
dower
house
it
stood
on
the
neck
of
a
long
narrow
peninsula
that
stretched
for
about
two
miles
seaward
all
the
land
on
this
little
domain
was
the
private
property
of
trevellyan
the
owner
of
pontperran
tower
from
whom
miss
birks
rented
the
school
and
who
had
granted
full
and
entire
leave
for
the
pupils
to
wander
where
they
wished
the
result
of
this
generous
concession
was
to
give
the
girls
a
much
larger
amount
of
freedom
than
would
have
been
possible
in
any
other
situation
the
isolated
position
of
the
peninsula
only
accessible
through
the
castle
gateway
made
it
as
safe
and
secluded
a
spot
as
a
convent
garden
and
afforded
a
range
of
scenery
that
might
well
be
a
source
of
congratulation
to
those
who
enjoyed
it
there
are
few
schools
that
possess
a
whole
headland
for
a
playground
and
especially
such
a
headland
that
seemed
so
completely
equipped
for
the
purpose
it
held
the
most
delightful
of
narrow
coves
with
gently
shelving
sandy
beaches
ideal
bathing
places
in
and
mysterious
caverns
that
might
occasionally
be
explored
with
a
candle
and
interesting
pools
among
the
rocks
where
at
low
tide
could
be
found
seaweeds
and
anemones
and
crabs
and
limpets
or
a
bestranded
starfish
on
the
steep
cliffs
that
rose
sheer
and
jagged
from
the
green
water
the
seabirds
built
in
the
spring
and
at
the
summit
on
the
very
verge
of
the
precipice
bloomed
in
their
season
many
choice
and
rare
wild
flowers
the
lovely
vernal
squill
with
its
blossoms
like
stars
the
handsome
crimson
the
yellow
masses
of
the
lady
fingers
the
pink
tufts
of
the
rosy
thrift
or
the
fleshy
leaves
of
the
curious
samphire
the
whole
extent
of
the
headland
was
occupied
by
a
tract
of
rough
heathery
ground
generally
called
the
warren
a
few
sheep
were
turned
out
here
to
crop
the
fine
grass
that
grew
between
the
gorse
bushes
and
a
pair
of
goats
were
often
tethered
within
easy
reach
of
the
coachman
cottage
but
otherwise
it
was
the
reserve
of
the
rabbits
that
scuttled
away
in
every
direction
should
a
human
footstep
invade
the
sanctuary
of
their
dominion
on
these
delightful
breezy
uplands
where
the
pleasant
west
wind
blew
fresh
and
warm
from
the
gulf
stream
miss
birks
pupils
might
wander
at
will
during
play
hours
only
observing
a
few
sensible
restrictions
dangerous
climbs
on
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
or
over
slippery
rocks
were
forbidden
and
not
less
than
three
girls
must
always
be
together
this
last
rule
was
a
very
necessary
one
in
the
circumstances
for
in
case
of
any
accident
to
a
member
of
the
trio
it
allowed
one
to
stay
with
the
sufferer
and
render
any
first
aid
possible
while
the
other
went
at
topmost
speed
to
lodge
information
at
the
old
dwelling
itself
was
a
suitable
and
appropriate
building
for
a
school
erected
originally
in
the
fourteenth
century
as
a
small
nunnery
it
had
in
the
days
of
edward
vi
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
then
lord
of
the
castle
who
had
turned
it
into
a
dower
house
successive
generations
of
owners
had
in
their
time
added
to
it
or
altered
it
but
had
not
spoilt
its
general
atmosphere
of
mediaevalism
little
pieces
of
perpendicular
window
tracery
or
remains
of
archways
were
frequent
in
the
old
walls
and
a
ruined
turreted
gateway
bore
witness
to
the
beauty
of
the
ancient
architecture
nobody
quite
knew
what
vaults
and
cellars
there
might
be
under
the
house
remains
of
staircases
had
certainly
been
found
and
many
of
the
floors
resounded
with
a
suggestively
hollow
ring
but
all
tradition
of
these
had
been
lost
and
not
even
a
legend
lingered
to
gratify
the
curious
there
was
one
element
of
mystery
however
which
formed
a
perennial
interest
and
a
topic
of
conversation
among
the
girls
in
the
centre
of
the
first
landing
right
in
the
midst
of
the
principal
bedrooms
stood
a
room
the
heavy
oak
door
was
locked
and
as
an
extra
protection
thick
iron
bars
had
been
placed
across
and
secured
firmly
to
the
jambs
even
the
keyhole
was
stopped
up
so
that
the
most
inquisitive
eye
could
obtain
no
satisfaction
all
that
anybody
knew
was
the
fact
that
trevellyan
who
had
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
had
caused
a
special
clause
to
be
made
in
the
lease
which
she
had
granted
to
miss
birks
stipulating
for
no
interference
with
the
barred
room
under
pain
of
forfeiture
of
the
entire
agreement
that
means
if
we
bored
a
hole
through
the
door
and
peeped
in
the
whole
school
would
be
turned
out
of
the
house
said
evie
bennett
once
when
the
subject
was
under
discussion
even
miss
birks
does
know
what
inside
said
elyned
hughes
with
an
awed
shudder
trevellyan
would
let
the
place
on
any
other
conditions
she
said
she
rather
have
it
empty
first
added
annie
pridwell
what
can
she
have
there
i
give
ten
thousand
pounds
to
find
out
but
though
speculation
might
run
rife
in
the
school
and
a
hundred
different
theories
be
advanced
there
was
not
the
slightest
means
of
verifying
a
single
one
of
them
ghosts
smugglers
or
a
family
skeleton
were
among
the
favourite
suggestions
and
the
girls
often
amused
themselves
with
even
wilder
fancies
from
the
outside
the
secluded
room
presented
as
insuperable
a
barrier
as
from
within
heavy
shutters
secured
the
window
and
guarded
the
secret
closely
and
jealously
from
all
prying
and
peeping
that
uncanny
noises
should
apparently
issue
from
this
abode
of
mystery
goes
without
saying
there
were
mice
in
plenty
and
even
an
occasional
rat
or
two
in
the
old
house
and
their
gnawings
scamperings
and
squeakings
might
easily
be
construed
into
thumps
bumps
and
groans
the
girls
would
often
get
up
scares
among
themselves
and
be
absolutely
convinced
that
a
tragedy
either
real
or
supernatural
was
being
enacted
behind
the
oak
door
miss
birks
sensible
and
as
became
a
headmistress
laughed
at
her
pupils
notions
and
declared
that
her
chief
objection
to
the
peculiar
clause
in
her
lease
was
the
waste
of
a
good
bedroom
which
would
have
been
invaluable
as
an
extra
dormitory
she
hung
a
thick
plush
curtain
over
the
doorway
and
utterly
tabooed
the
subject
of
the
mystery
she
could
not
however
prevent
the
girls
talking
about
it
among
themselves
and
to
them
the
barred
room
became
a
veritable
bluebeard
chamber
at
night
they
scuttled
past
it
with
averted
gaze
and
fingers
stuffed
in
their
ears
having
an
uneasy
apprehension
lest
a
skeleton
hand
should
suddenly
draw
aside
the
curtain
and
a
face
be
it
ghost
or
grinning
goblin
peer
at
them
out
of
the
darkness
they
would
dare
each
other
to
stand
and
listen
or
to
pass
the
door
alone
and
among
the
younger
ones
a
character
for
heroism
stood
or
fell
on
the
capacity
of
venturing
nearest
to
the
bogey
hole
though
miss
birks
might
well
regret
such
a
disability
in
her
lease
of
the
dower
house
she
was
proud
of
the
aspect
of
the
place
and
treasured
up
any
traditions
of
the
past
that
she
could
gather
together
she
had
carefully
written
down
all
surviving
details
of
the
franciscan
convent
having
after
endless
trouble
secured
some
account
of
it
from
rare
books
and
manuscripts
in
the
possession
of
some
of
the
country
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
beyond
the
dates
of
its
founding
and
dissolution
and
the
names
of
its
abbesses
there
was
little
to
be
learnt
though
a
few
old
records
of
business
transactions
gave
an
idea
of
its
extent
and
importance
dearly
as
she
valued
the
origin
of
her
establishment
miss
birks
did
not
sacrifice
comfort
to
any
love
of
the
antique
inside
the
ancient
walls
everything
was
strictly
modern
and
hygienic
with
the
latest
patterns
of
desks
the
most
sanitary
and
each
appliance
that
educational
authorities
might
suggest
or
devise
could
the
grey
nuns
have
but
returned
and
taken
a
peep
into
the
little
chemical
laboratory
they
would
probably
have
fancied
themselves
in
the
chamber
of
a
wizard
in
league
with
the
fiends
of
darkness
and
have
crossed
themselves
in
pious
fear
at
the
sight
of
the
bottles
and
retorts
the
gymnasium
would
have
puzzled
them
sorely
and
a
hockey
match
have
aroused
their
sincerest
horror
mutantur
nos
et
mutamur
in
the
times
are
changed
and
we
are
changed
with
them
though
we
have
lost
something
of
the
picturesqueness
of
mediaeval
life
the
childlike
faith
of
a
childlike
age
the
simplicity
of
a
nation
only
groping
to
feel
its
strength
we
have
surely
gained
in
the
long
years
of
growth
in
the
gradual
awakening
to
the
thousand
things
undreamt
of
by
our
forefathers
and
can
justly
deem
that
our
lasses
have
inherited
a
golden
harvest
of
thought
and
experience
from
those
who
have
trod
before
them
the
thorny
and
difficult
pathway
that
leads
to
knowledge
such
were
the
picturesque
and
surroundings
at
the
dower
house
and
now
a
word
on
that
much
more
important
subject
the
girls
themselves
miss
birks
only
received
twenty
pupils
all
over
fourteen
years
of
age
therefore
there
was
no
division
into
upper
and
lower
school
five
elder
girls
constituted
the
sixth
and
the
rest
were
placed
according
to
their
capabilities
in
two
sections
of
the
fifth
form
of
these
vb
was
considerably
the
larger
and
containing
as
it
did
the
younger
cruder
and
spirits
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
mistresses
the
portion
which
required
the
finer
tact
and
the
greater
amount
of
careful
management
it
was
not
that
its
members
gave
any
special
trouble
but
they
were
somewhat
in
the
position
of
novices
not
yet
thoroughly
versed
in
the
traditions
of
the
little
community
and
needing
skill
and
patience
during
the
process
of
their
initiation
almost
insensibly
the
nine
seemed
to
split
up
into
separate
parties
romola
harvey
barbara
marshall
and
elyned
hughes
lived
in
the
same
town
and
knew
each
other
at
home
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
to
knit
them
in
a
close
friendship
which
they
were
unwilling
to
share
with
anybody
else
the
news
from
springfield
their
native
place
formed
their
chief
subject
of
interest
and
those
who
could
not
understand
or
discuss
it
must
necessarily
be
in
the
position
of
outsiders
evie
bennett
annie
pridwell
and
betty
scott
were
lively
girls
so
full
of
irrepressible
fun
that
they
were
apt
to
drop
the
deeper
element
out
of
life
altogether
it
was
difficult
ever
to
find
them
in
a
serious
mood
their
jokes
were
incessant
and
they
certainly
well
earned
the
nickname
of
the
three
gigglers
which
was
generally
bestowed
upon
them
until
christmas
deirdre
sullivan
and
dulcie
wilcox
had
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
bedroom
to
themselves
a
circumstance
which
had
allowed
them
the
opportunity
of
cultivating
their
friendship
till
they
had
become
the
most
exclusive
chums
in
the
whole
of
the
school
deirdre
the
elder
by
six
months
was
a
picturesque
rather
girl
with
beautiful
expressive
grey
eyes
a
delicate
colour
and
a
neat
slim
little
figure
dulcie
on
the
contrary
much
to
her
mortification
was
inclined
to
stoutness
she
resembled
a
painting
by
rubens
for
her
plump
cheeks
were
pink
as
carnations
and
her
ruddy
hair
was
of
that
warm
shade
of
venetian
red
so
beloved
by
the
old
masters
it
was
a
sore
point
with
poor
dulcie
that
however
badly
her
head
ached
or
however
limp
or
indisposed
she
might
feel
her
high
colour
never
faded
and
no
pathetic
hollows
ever
appeared
in
her
cheeks
i
get
no
sympathy
when
i
ill
she
confided
to
deirdre
on
that
day
when
i
turned
faint
in
the
algebra
class
miss
harding
had
said
only
an
hour
before
do
look
well
child
i
wish
i
were
as
pale
and
thin
as
elyned
hughes
then
i
might
get
petted
and
excused
lessons
as
it
is
no
one
believes
me
when
i
complain
dulcie
who
possessed
an
intense
admiration
for
her
chum
struggled
perpetually
to
mould
herself
on
deirdre
model
sometimes
with
rather
comical
results
deirdre
romantic
tendencies
caused
her
to
affect
the
particular
style
of
the
heroine
of
nearly
every
fresh
book
she
read
and
she
changed
continually
from
an
air
of
reserved
and
stately
dignity
to
one
of
sparkling
vivacity
according
to
her
latest
favourite
in
fiction
with
deirdre
it
was
an
easy
matter
enough
to
assume
a
manner
but
dulcie
who
merely
copied
her
friend
slavishly
often
aroused
mirth
in
the
schoolroom
by
her
extraordinary
poses
who
is
it
now
dulcie
the
girls
would
ask
rebecca
of
york
or
the
scarlet
pimpernel
you
might
drop
us
a
hint
so
that
we
could
tell
and
treat
you
accordingly
and
dulcie
being
an
unimaginative
and
really
rather
obtuse
little
person
though
she
knew
she
was
being
laughed
at
could
never
quite
fathom
the
reason
why
and
continued
to
lisp
or
drawl
or
to
attempt
to
look
dignified
or
to
sparkle
with
a
praiseworthy
perseverance
worthy
of
a
better
object
chapter
iii
a
mysterious
schoolfellow
it
is
all
very
well
for
a
girl
to
be
shy
on
her
first
night
at
school
a
certain
amount
of
embarrassment
is
indeed
considered
almost
good
form
in
a
indicative
of
her
realization
of
the
privileges
which
she
is
about
to
enjoy
and
the
comparative
unworthiness
of
any
previous
establishment
she
may
have
attended
but
when
her
uncommunicative
attitude
is
unduly
prolonged
what
was
at
first
labelled
mere
becoming
bashfulness
is
termed
stupidity
closeness
conceit
or
intentional
rudeness
by
her
companions
who
highly
resent
any
repulse
of
their
offers
of
friendship
gerda
thorwaldson
after
nearly
a
fortnight
at
the
dower
house
seemed
as
much
a
stranger
as
on
the
evening
when
she
arrived
she
was
neither
uncivil
nor
disobliging
but
no
efforts
on
the
part
of
her
schoolmates
were
able
to
penetrate
the
thick
barrier
of
her
reserve
she
appeared
most
unwilling
to
enter
into
any
particulars
of
her
former
life
and
beyond
the
fact
that
she
had
been
educated
chiefly
in
germany
no
information
could
be
dragged
from
her
you
only
to
hint
at
her
home
and
she
shuts
up
like
an
oyster
said
annie
pridwell
aggrievedly
annie
had
a
natural
love
of
biography
she
delighted
in
hearing
her
comrades
experiences
and
was
so
well
up
in
everybody
private
affairs
that
she
could
have
written
a
who
who
of
the
school
you
ought
to
know
deirdre
she
continued
does
she
tell
you
anything
at
all
in
your
bedroom
hardly
opens
her
mouth
replied
deirdre
you
would
believe
how
difficult
it
is
to
talk
to
her
she
just
says
or
and
occasionally
asks
a
question
but
she
certainly
tells
us
nothing
about
herself
never
met
with
anyone
so
mum
in
my
life
added
dulcie
the
question
of
gerda
nationality
still
weighed
upon
dulcie
spirits
in
her
opinion
a
girl
who
could
speak
a
foreign
language
with
such
absolute
fluency
did
not
deserve
to
be
called
english
and
she
was
further
disturbed
by
a
hint
which
got
abroad
that
the
new
girl
had
been
requisitioned
to
the
school
for
the
particular
purpose
of
talking
german
if
that
so
why
has
she
been
poked
upon
us
she
demanded
indignantly
why
was
she
put
in
a
dormitory
with
somebody
appreciate
her
better
marcia
richards
for
instance
who
says
she
our
advantages
ask
miss
birks
oh
i
dare
say
but
i
do
like
people
who
listen
to
everything
and
say
nothing
it
gives
one
the
idea
they
mean
to
sneak
some
day
though
gerda
attitude
regarding
her
own
affairs
was
uncommunicative
she
nevertheless
appeared
to
take
a
profound
interest
in
her
present
surroundings
as
dulcie
had
noticed
she
listened
to
everything
and
no
detail
however
small
seemed
to
escape
her
she
was
anxious
to
learn
all
she
could
concerning
the
old
house
the
neighbourhood
and
the
families
who
resided
near
and
would
ask
an
occasional
question
on
the
subject
often
blushing
scarlet
as
she
put
her
queries
why
i
should
think
you
could
draw
a
plan
of
the
house
said
dulcie
one
day
what
does
it
matter
whether
the
larder
is
underneath
our
dormitory
or
not
you
ca
dive
through
the
floor
and
purloin
tarts
no
of
course
not
i
was
only
wondering
replied
gerda
shrinking
into
her
shell
again
nevertheless
later
on
in
the
afternoon
dulcie
suddenly
came
across
her
measuring
the
landing
with
a
yard
tape
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
wonderful
are
you
doing
exclaimed
the
damsel
oh
nothing
nothing
said
gerda
hastily
rolling
up
her
tape
measure
and
slipping
it
into
her
pocket
only
just
an
idea
that
came
into
my
head
i
wanted
to
know
the
length
of
the
passage
that
was
all
what
a
most
extraordinary
thing
to
want
to
know
really
gerda
the
queerest
girl
i
ever
met
is
it
having
lived
in
germany
that
makes
you
so
odd
i
suppose
it
must
be
murmured
gerda
escaping
as
rapidly
as
possible
into
the
schoolroom
i
have
said
before
that
owing
to
the
unique
situation
of
the
dower
house
the
girls
were
allowed
an
amount
of
liberty
in
their
which
could
not
so
easily
have
been
granted
to
them
at
other
schools
they
wandered
freely
about
the
headland
without
a
mistress
and
so
far
had
never
abused
their
privileges
either
by
getting
into
danger
or
staying
out
beyond
the
specified
time
though
as
a
rule
they
rambled
in
trios
on
the
first
of
february
the
whole
of
form
vb
might
have
been
seen
walking
together
over
the
warren
they
had
a
motive
for
their
excursion
for
it
was
perran
day
and
perran
was
the
patron
saint
of
the
district
at
the
end
of
the
promontory
there
was
a
small
spring
dedicated
to
his
memory
and
according
to
ancient
legends
anybody
who
on
his
anniversary
dropped
a
pin
into
this
well
might
learn
her
luck
for
the
coming
year
formerly
all
the
lads
and
lasses
from
the
villages
of
pontperran
porthmorvan
and
perranwrack
used
to
come
to
deck
the
well
and
try
their
fortunes
but
their
annual
visitation
having
degenerated
into
a
rather
riotous
and
undesirable
ceremony
trevellyan
had
put
up
extra
trespass
notices
and
given
strict
orders
to
her
gamekeeper
to
exclude
the
public
from
the
headland
knowing
of
the
ancient
custom
which
had
been
practised
from
time
immemorial
it
was
of
course
only
in
schoolgirl
nature
to
want
to
test
the
powers
of
divination
attributed
to
the
old
well
the
sixth
form
who
considered
themselves
almost
grown
up
treated
the
affair
with
ridicule
and
the
members
of
va
who
copied
their
seniors
slavishly
likewise
affected
a
supreme
contempt
for
so
childish
a
proceeding
but
vb
being
still
at
an
age
when
superstition
holds
an
immense
attraction
trotted
off
to
pay
their
respects
to
perran
each
in
deference
to
the
tradition
of
the
neighbourhood
bore
a
garland
of
ferns
and
other
greeneries
and
each
came
armed
with
the
necessary
pin
that
was
to
work
the
spell
jessie
macpherson
says
we
a
set
of
sillies
volunteered
betty
scott
but
i
do
care
i
would
miss
perran
day
for
anything
my
wish
came
true
last
year
put
in
barbara
marshall
oh
i
do
hope
i
shall
have
some
luck
shivered
elyned
hughes
the
well
in
question
lay
in
a
slight
hollow
a
kind
of
narrow
gully
where
in
wet
weather
a
small
stream
ambled
between
the
rocks
and
ran
down
to
the
sea
in
the
mild
cornish
climate
ferns
were
growing
here
fresh
and
green
ignoring
the
presence
of
winter
and
cinquefoil
and
other
early
plants
were
pushing
up
strong
leaves
in
preparation
for
the
springtime
the
famous
well
was
nothing
but
a
shallow
basin
of
rock
into
which
the
little
stream
flowed
leisurely
and
having
partially
filled
it
trickled
away
through
a
gap
and
became
for
a
yard
or
two
merged
in
a
patch
of
swampy
herbage
overhung
with
long
fronds
of
and
tufts
of
hawkweed
it
had
a
picturesque
aspect
and
the
water
seemed
to
gurgle
slowly
and
mysteriously
as
if
it
were
trying
in
some
unknown
language
to
reveal
a
secret
the
girls
clustered
round
and
began
in
orthodox
fashion
to
hang
their
garlands
on
the
leafless
branches
of
a
stunted
tree
that
stretched
itself
over
the
spring
they
were
in
various
moods
some
giggling
some
some
silent
and
some
chattering
it
is
as
high
as
it
was
last
year
so
i
do
believe
it
will
work
so
well
said
evie
bennett
perran
must
be
in
a
bad
temper
and
has
looked
after
it
properly
tiresome
old
man
why
ca
he
remember
his
own
day
he
got
to
do
double
duty
poor
old
chap
laughed
betty
scott
you
forget
he
the
patron
saint
of
the
sailors
as
well
and
is
supposed
to
be
out
at
sea
attracting
the
fish
perhaps
he
just
had
time
this
morning
and
thought
the
well
would
do
let
well
alone
in
fact
giggled
evie
oh
shut
her
up
for
her
bad
pun
dip
her
head
in
the
water
make
her
try
her
luck
first
pleased
to
accommodate
you
i
sure
here
my
pin
returned
evie
now
if
you
ready
i
begin
and
consult
the
oracle
perran
ceremony
had
to
be
performed
in
due
order
or
it
was
supposed
to
be
of
no
effect
first
of
all
evie
solemnly
dropped
her
pin
in
the
well
as
a
species
of
votive
offering
while
silently
she
murmured
a
wish
then
placing
a
small
piece
of
stick
on
the
surface
of
the
water
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
basin
she
repeated
the
formula
perran
perran
of
the
well
what
i
wished
i
may
not
tell
is
but
known
to
me
and
you
help
me
then
to
bring
it
true
all
eyes
were
fixed
eagerly
on
the
piece
of
stick
which
was
already
commencing
to
circle
round
in
the
water
if
it
found
its
way
successfully
through
the
gap
and
was
washed
down
by
the
stream
it
was
a
sign
that
perran
had
it
safely
and
would
attend
to
the
matter
but
if
it
were
stranded
on
the
edge
of
the
basin
the
wish
would
remain
unfulfilled
round
and
round
went
the
tiny
twig
bobbing
and
dancing
in
the
eddies
but
alas
the
water
was
low
this
february
and
instead
of
sweeping
the
twig
triumphantly
through
the
aperture
it
only
washed
it
to
one
side
and
left
it
clinging
to
some
overhanging
fronds
of
fern
that
dipped
into
the
spring
evie
heaved
a
tragic
sigh
of
disappointment
i
done
for
at
any
rate
she
groaned
perran
wo
have
anything
to
say
to
me
this
year
oh
and
it
was
such
a
lovely
wish
i
tell
you
what
it
was
now
it
not
going
to
come
off
i
wished
some
aviator
would
ask
me
to
have
a
seat
in
his
aeroplane
and
take
me
right
over
to
america
in
it
the
girls
tittered
what
a
particularly
likely
wish
to
be
fulfilled
no
my
hearty
you
ca
expect
perran
to
have
anything
to
do
with
aeroplanes
said
betty
scott
the
good
old
saint
probably
abhors
all
modern
inventions
i
going
to
wish
for
something
easy
and
probable
what
ah
would
you
like
to
know
i
sha
tell
you
even
if
i
fail
shall
i
try
next
whatever
betty
easy
and
probable
desire
may
have
been
the
result
was
bad
and
her
stick
after
several
thrilling
gyrations
tagged
itself
on
to
evie
under
the
cluster
of
fern
she
bore
her
ill
luck
like
a
stoic
one
ca
have
everything
in
this
world
she
philosophized
perhaps
i
get
it
next
year
instead
deirdre
sullivan
you
deserve
to
lose
your
own
for
sniggering
this
trial
ought
to
be
taken
solemnly
get
perran
temper
up
if
we
make
fun
of
it
i
thought
he
was
out
at
sea
attracting
the
fishes
said
deirdre
i
not
sure
that
cornish
saints
ca
be
in
two
places
at
once
just
to
show
their
superiority
over
devonshire
ones
well
go
on
laugh
if
you
like
but
do
expect
perran
to
take
any
interest
in
you
it
certainly
seemed
as
though
the
patron
of
the
well
had
for
once
forsaken
his
favourite
haunt
girl
after
girl
wished
her
wish
and
repeated
her
spell
but
invariably
to
meet
with
the
same
ill
fortune
till
a
melancholy
little
clump
of
eight
sticks
testified
to
the
general
failure
have
we
all
lost
no
gerda
thorwaldson
has
tried
where
gerda
she
got
to
do
the
same
as
anybody
else
gerda
thorwaldson
where
are
you
gerda
for
the
moment
had
been
missing
but
at
the
sound
of
her
name
she
scrambled
down
from
the
rocks
above
the
well
looking
rather
red
and
conscious
what
were
you
doing
up
there
asked
dulcie
sharply
it
your
turn
to
try
the
omen
go
along
quick
we
shall
have
to
be
jogging
back
in
half
a
jiff
gerda
paused
for
a
moment
and
with
face
full
towards
the
sea
muttered
her
wish
with
moving
lips
then
turning
to
the
tree
she
carefully
counted
the
third
bough
from
the
bottom
and
the
third
twig
on
the
bough
breaking
off
her
due
portion
she
twisted
it
round
three
times
and
holding
it
between
the
third
fingers
of
either
hand
dropped
it
into
the
water
while
she
rapidly
repeated
the
magic
formula
perran
perran
of
the
well
what
i
wished
i
may
not
tell
is
but
known
to
me
and
you
help
me
then
to
bring
it
true
the
girls
watched
rather
they
were
growing
a
little
tired
of
the
performance
they
fully
expected
the
ninth
stick
to
drift
the
same
way
as
its
predecessors
but
to
everybody
astonishment
it
made
one
rapid
circle
of
the
basin
and
bobbed
successfully
through
the
gap
it
gone
it
gone
cried
betty
scott
in
wild
excitement
perran
working
after
all
oh
why
did
he
do
it
for
me
how
funny
it
should
be
the
only
one
said
elyned
hughes
i
believe
the
water
running
faster
than
it
did
before
commented
romola
harvey
has
the
old
saint
turned
on
the
tap
shall
i
get
my
wish
said
gerda
who
stood
by
with
shining
eyes
of
course
you
get
it
certain
sure
and
jolly
fortunate
you
are
too
you
won
the
luck
of
the
whole
form
do
i
wish
i
were
you
just
you
evidently
perran
favourite
laughed
annie
pridwell
come
along
it
nearly
time
for
we
be
late
if
we
sprint
said
barbara
marshall
consulting
her
watch
and
starting
at
a
run
on
the
path
that
led
back
to
the
dower
house
it
was
a
funny
thing
that
our
sticks
should
all
and
just
sail
off
as
easily
as
you
like
said
deirdre
that
evening
as
with
dulcie
she
gave
an
account
of
the
occurrence
to
phyllis
rowland
a
member
of
the
sixth
as
one
of
the
elect
of
the
school
phyllis
would
not
have
condescended
to
consult
the
famous
oracle
but
she
nevertheless
took
a
sneaking
interest
in
the
annual
ceremony
and
was
anxious
to
know
how
perran
votaries
had
fared
did
you
do
it
really
properly
she
enquired
an
old
woman
at
perranwrack
once
told
me
it
was
any
use
at
all
if
you
forgot
the
least
thing
why
we
hung
up
our
garlands
and
then
wished
and
said
the
rhyme
and
threw
in
our
sticks
oh
that
is
half
enough
where
were
you
looking
when
you
wished
facing
the
sea
your
stick
should
be
chosen
from
the
third
twig
on
the
third
branch
and
it
ought
to
be
turned
round
three
times
and
held
between
your
third
fingers
did
you
do
all
that
the
faces
of
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
a
study
no
we
did
but
gerda
thorwaldson
did
it
every
bit
and
the
water
came
down
ever
so
much
faster
for
her
turn
too
probably
she
went
behind
the
well
and
cleared
the
channel
of
the
stream
that
a
dodge
to
make
the
water
flow
quicker
and
help
the
saint
to
work
i
certainly
saw
her
climbing
down
the
rocks
gasped
dulcie
then
she
a
cleverer
girl
than
i
took
her
for
and
deserves
her
luck
laughed
phyllis
look
here
i
ca
stay
wasting
time
any
longer
got
my
prep
to
do
ta
ta
do
let
perran
blight
your
young
lives
try
him
again
next
year
left
alone
deirdre
and
dulcie
subsided
simultaneously
on
to
a
bench
it
beats
me
altogether
said
dulcie
shaking
her
head
how
did
she
manage
to
do
it
how
did
she
know
who
told
her
that
the
puzzler
returned
deirdre
certainly
not
phyllis
and
i
do
believe
anybody
else
ever
heard
of
those
extra
dodges
only
been
a
fortnight
at
the
school
and
says
she
never
been
in
cornwall
in
her
life
before
so
how
could
she
know
yet
she
did
it
all
so
pat
it
queer
to
say
the
least
of
it
do
you
know
dulcie
i
think
there
something
mysterious
about
gerda
i
noticed
it
ever
since
she
came
she
seems
all
the
time
to
be
trying
to
hide
something
she
wo
tell
us
a
scrap
about
herself
and
yet
she
always
asking
questions
what
she
up
to
then
that
what
i
want
to
find
out
it
evidently
something
she
want
people
to
know
she
ought
to
be
watched
i
vote
we
keep
an
eye
on
her
i
really
believe
we
ought
to
but
mind
you
must
let
her
suspect
we
notice
anything
that
would
give
the
show
away
at
once
lie
low
our
motto
right
you
are
agreed
dulcie
mum
the
word
chapter
iv
the
king
of
the
castle
the
members
of
vb
often
congratulated
themselves
that
their
special
classroom
was
decidedly
larger
than
that
of
the
sixth
or
of
va
they
were
apt
to
boast
of
their
superior
accommodation
and
would
never
admit
the
return
argument
that
being
so
much
larger
a
form
their
room
really
allowed
less
space
per
girl
and
was
therefore
actually
inferior
to
its
rivals
on
one
february
evening
the
whole
nine
were
sitting
round
the
fire
luxuriating
in
half
an
hour
delicious
idleness
before
the
bell
rang
for
second
those
who
had
been
first
in
the
field
had
secured
the
but
the
majority
squatted
on
the
making
as
close
a
ring
as
they
could
for
the
night
was
cold
and
there
was
a
nip
of
frost
in
the
air

to
talk

be
wanted
for

on
this
is
the
silly
season
so
i
hope

endeavour

improve
my
mind

a
herculean
task
before
them
if
they
did
sniggered

be
empty
but

jolly
heavy

the

mass
of
ingratitude

was
a
mark
of

affection

kind
of
grew
in
beauty

by
side
do

i
do

enlarge
our
intellects
we

returned
deirdre
promptly
oh
irish
of
the
irish
laughed
the
girls
did
you
say
it
on
purpose
or
did
it
come
unconsciously
i
wish
i
were
irish
somehow
i
never
say
funny
things
not
even
if
i
try
lamented
dulcie
because
you
could
you
a
dear
fat
dumpling
and
dumplings
never
are
funny
you
know
it
against
nature
it
not
my
fault
if
i
fat
said
dulcie
plaintively
people
say
and
grow
fat
so
why
should
a
plump
person
be
funny
they
are
funny
very
funny
though
not
quite
in
the
way
you
mean
oh
look
here
do
be
horrid
you
began
it
yourself
children
do
barge
interrupted
romola
harvey
you
really
are
rather
a
set
of
lunatics
ca
anyone
tell
a
story
i
was
taught
to
call
fibbing
a
sin
in
the
days
of
my
youth
retorted
betty
scott
assuming
a
serious
countenance
you
you
ragtimer
i
mean
a
real
story
a
tale
a
legend
a
romance
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
do
know
any
we
used
them
all
up
said
evie
bennett
yawning
lustily
we
all
know
the
legend
of
the
abbess
gertrude
it
miss
birks
favourite
chestnut
and
what
she
said
to
the
commissioner
who
came
to
confiscate
the
convent
and
we
had
the
one
about
monmouth
rebellion
till
as
stale
as
stale
can
be
i
defy
anybody
to
have
the
hardihood
to
repeat
it
are
there
any
other
tales
about
the
neighbourhood
asked
gerda
thorwaldson
it
was
the
first
remark
that
she
had
made
oh
i
do
think
so
the
old
castle
very
sparse
in
legends
i
suppose
there
ought
to
be
a
few
but
they
mostly
forgotten
who
used
to
live
there
trevellyans
there
always
have
been
trevellyans
hosts
of
them
though
now
there
nobody
left
but
trevellyan
and
ronnie
who
ronnie
more
than
half
a
dozen
answers
came
instantly
ronnie
why
he
just
ronnie
trevellyan
the
dearest
darling
you
never
saw
anyone
so
sweet
we
all
of
us
adore
him
we
call
him
king
of
the
castle
they
been
away
staying
in
london
but
they
coming
back
this
week
is
he
grown
up
enquired
gerda
casually
grown
up
exploded
the
girls
he
not
quite
six
he
lives
with
trevellyan
explained
betty
because
he
has
got
any
father
or
mother
of
his
own
oh
betty
he
has
burst
out
barbara
well
that
the
first
i
ever
heard
of
them
then
i
thought
he
was
an
orphan
he
as
good
as
an
orphan
poor
little
chap
why
nobody
ever
mentions
his
father
why
on
earth
not
oh
i
do
know
there
something
mysterious
trevellyan
like
it
talked
about
nobody
dare
even
drop
a
hint
to
her
what
wrong
with
ronnie
father
i
tell
you
i
do
know
except
that
i
believe
he
did
something
he
should
have
rough
on
ronnie
ronnie
does
know
of
course
and
nobody
would
be
cruel
enough
to
tell
him
you
must
promise
you
none
of
you
mention
what
i
said
not
to
anybody
rather
not
you
can
trust
us
replied
all
it
was
perhaps
only
natural
that
the
affairs
of
the
castle
should
seem
important
to
the
dwellers
at
the
dower
house
the
two
buildings
lay
so
near
together
yet
were
so
isolated
in
their
position
as
regarded
other
habitations
that
they
united
in
many
ways
for
their
mutual
convenience
if
miss
birks
gardener
was
going
to
the
town
he
would
execute
commissions
for
the
castle
as
well
as
for
his
own
mistress
and
on
the
other
hand
the
castle
chauffeur
would
call
at
the
dower
house
for
letters
to
be
sent
by
the
late
post
trevellyan
was
a
widow
with
no
family
of
her
own
she
had
adopted
her
ronald
while
he
was
still
quite
a
baby
and
he
could
remember
no
other
home
than
hers
the
little
fellow
was
the
one
delight
and
solace
of
her
advancing
years
her
life
centred
round
ronnie
she
thought
continually
of
his
interests
and
made
many
plans
for
his
future
he
was
her
constant
companion
and
his
pretty
affectionate
ways
and
merry
chatter
did
much
to
help
her
to
forget
old
griefs
he
was
a
most
winning
engaging
child
a
favourite
with
everybody
and
reigned
undoubtedly
as
monarch
in
the
hearts
of
all
who
had
the
care
of
him
it
was
partly
on
ronnie
account
and
partly
because
she
really
loved
young
people
that
trevellyan
took
so
much
notice
of
the
pupils
at
the
dower
house
on
her
nephew
behalf
she
would
have
preferred
a
boys
preparatory
school
for
neighbour
but
even
girls
over
fourteen
were
better
than
nobody
they
made
an
element
of
youth
that
was
good
for
ronnie
and
prevented
the
castle
from
seeming
too
dull
the
knowledge
that
he
might
perhaps
meet
his
friends
on
the
headland
gave
an
object
to
the
little
boy
daily
walk
and
the
jokes
and
banter
with
which
they
generally
greeted
him
provided
him
with
a
subject
for
conversation
afterwards
the
girls
on
their
part
showed
the
liveliest
interest
in
anything
connected
with
the
castle
they
would
watch
the
motor
passing
in
and
out
of
the
great
gates
would
peep
from
their
top
windows
to
look
at
the
gardeners
mowing
the
lawns
and
would
even
count
the
rooks
nests
that
were
built
in
the
grove
of
elm
trees
occasionally
trevellyan
would
ask
the
whole
school
to
tea
and
that
was
regarded
as
so
immense
a
treat
that
the
girls
always
looked
forward
to
the
delightful
chance
that
some
fortunate
morning
an
invitation
might
be
forthcoming
trevellyan
had
been
staying
in
london
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
but
early
in
february
she
returned
home
again
on
the
day
after
her
arrival
the
girls
were
walking
back
from
a
hockey
practice
on
the
warren
swinging
their
way
along
the
narrow
tracks
between
last
bracken
and
heather
or
having
an
impromptu
contest
where
a
small
stream
crossed
the
path
it
so
jolly
to
see
the
flag
up
again
at
the
castle
said
evie
bennett
looking
at
the
turret
where
the
union
jack
was
flying
bravely
in
the
breeze
i
always
feel
as
if
it
a
kind
of
national
defence
any
ships
sailing
by
would
know
it
was
england
they
were
passing
i
like
it
because
it
means
trevellyan
at
home
said
deirdre
sullivan
a
place
seems
so
forlorn
when
the
family
away
did
ronnie
come
back
too
last
night
yes
hilda
marriott
saw
him
from
the
window
this
morning
he
was
going
down
the
road
with
his
new
governess
why
there
he
is
actually
watching
for
us
the
darling
the
girls
had
to
pass
close
to
a
turnstile
that
led
from
the
castle
grounds
into
the
warren
and
here
perched
astride
the
top
rail
of
the
gate
evidently
on
the
for
them
a
small
boy
was
waving
his
cap
in
frantic
welcome
he
was
a
pretty
little
fellow
with
the
bluest
of
eyes
and
the
fairest
of
skins
and
the
lightest
of
flaxen
hair
and
he
seemed
dimpling
all
over
his
merry
face
with
delight
at
the
meeting
the
girls
simply
made
a
rush
for
him
and
he
was
handed
about
from
one
to
another
struggling
in
laughing
protest
till
at
last
he
wriggled
himself
free
and
retiring
behind
the
turnstile
held
the
gate
as
a
barrier
illustration
a
small
boy
was
waving
his
cap
in
frantic
welcome
i
knew
you
be
coming
past
so
i
got
leave
to
play
here
thank
you
all
for
your
christmas
cards
he
said
gaily
yes
i
like
my
new
governess
her
name
miss
herbert
and
she
ripping
auntie
going
to
ask
you
to
tea
i
want
to
show
you
my
engine
i
got
at
christmas
it
goes
round
the
floor
and
it
really
puffs
you
come
oh
we
come
all
right
chuckled
the
girls
we
got
something
at
the
dower
house
to
show
you
too
no
we
sha
tell
you
what
it
is
it
to
be
a
surprise
oh
goody
there
the
bell
we
must
be
off
if
we
do
fly
we
shall
all
be
late
for
no
not
to
come
through
the
gate
to
say
go
back
you
rascal
you
know
you
not
allowed
on
the
warren
as
the
big
bell
at
the
dower
house
was
its
loudest
the
girls
set
off
at
a
run
there
was
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
if
they
meant
to
be
in
their
places
to
answer
present
to
their
names
and
missing
the
meant
awkward
explanations
with
miss
birks
one
only
oblivious
of
the
urgency
of
the
occasion
lingered
behind
gerda
thorwaldson
had
stood
apart
while
the
others
greeted
ronnie
merely
looking
on
as
if
the
meeting
were
of
no
interest
to
her
nobody
had
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
her
or
had
indeed
remembered
her
existence
at
the
moment
she
counted
for
so
little
with
her
schoolfellows
that
it
never
struck
them
to
introduce
her
to
their
favourite
in
fact
they
had
been
totally
occupied
among
themselves
in
fighting
for
possession
of
him
she
remained
now
until
the
very
last
school
sports
cap
was
round
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
then
she
dashed
through
the
turnstile
and
overtaking
ronnie
thrust
a
packet
of
chocolates
rather
awkwardly
into
his
hand
the
bell
had
long
ceased
clanging
and
miss
birks
had
closed
the
book
when
gerda
entered
the
schoolroom
as
she
would
offer
no
explanation
of
her
lateness
she
was
given
a
page
of
french
poetry
to
learn
to
teach
her
next
time
to
regard
punctuality
as
a
cardinal
virtue
she
took
her
punishment
with
absolute
stolidity
what
a
queer
girl
she
is
she
never
seems
to
care
what
happens
said
dulcie
i
should
mind
if
miss
birks
glared
at
me
in
that
way
to
say
nothing
of
a
whole
page
of
she
looked
as
if
she
been
crying
when
she
came
in
remarked
deirdre
she
not
crying
now
at
any
rate
she
simply
looks
unapproachable
what
made
her
so
late
she
was
with
us
on
the
warren
how
should
i
know
if
she
wo
tell
she
wo
you
might
as
well
try
to
make
a
mule
gallop
uphill
as
attempt
to
get
even
the
slightest
most
ordinary
everyday
scrap
of
information
out
of
such
a
sphinx
as
gerda
thorwaldson
chapter
v
practical
geography
miss
birks
often
congratulated
herself
on
the
fact
that
the
smallness
of
her
school
allowed
her
to
give
a
proportionately
large
amount
of
individual
attention
to
her
pupils
there
was
no
possibility
at
the
dower
house
for
even
the
laziest
girl
to
shirk
lessons
and
shield
her
ignorance
behind
the
general
bulk
of
information
possessed
by
the
form
backward
girls
dull
girls
delicate
girls
all
had
their
special
claims
considered
and
their
fair
chances
accorded
there
was
no
question
of
passing
in
a
crowd
each
pupil
stood
or
fell
on
the
merits
of
her
own
work
and
every
item
of
her
progress
was
noted
with
as
much
care
as
if
she
were
the
sole
charge
of
the
establishment
miss
birks
had
many
theories
of
education
some
gleaned
from
national
conferences
of
teachers
and
others
of
her
own
evolving
all
on
the
latest
of
modern
lines
one
of
her
pet
theories
was
the
practical
application
whenever
possible
of
every
lesson
learnt
according
to
the
season
the
girls
botanized
geologized
collected
caterpillars
and
chrysalides
or
hunted
for
marine
specimens
on
the
shore
vying
with
each
other
in
a
friendly
rivalry
as
to
which
could
secure
the
best
contributions
for
the
school
museum
there
was
no
subject
however
in
miss
birks
estimation
which
led
itself
more
readily
to
practical
illustration
than
geography
every
variety
of
physical
feature
was
examined
in
the
original
situation
so
that
watersheds
tributaries
currents
and
comparative
elevations
became
solid
facts
instead
of
mere
book
statements
and
each
girl
was
taught
to
make
her
own
map
of
the
district
i
believe
we
examined
everything
except
an
iceberg
and
a
volcano
declared
betty
scott
one
day
and
i
verily
believe
miss
birks
is
on
the
for
both
hoped
an
iceberg
might
be
washed
ashore
during
those
few
cold
days
we
had
in
january
and
you
know
she
told
us
beacon
hill
was
the
remains
of
an
extinct
volcano
i
expect
she
wished
it
might
burst
out
suddenly
again
like
vesuvius
just
to
show
us
how
it
did
it
would
we
squeal
and
run
if
we
heard
rumblings
and
saw
jets
of
steam
coming
up
commented
evie
bennett
i
do
think
many
of
us
would
stay
to
do
scientific
work
and
take
specimens
of
the
lava
where
are
we
going
this
afternoon
asked
elyned
hughes
mapping
miss
birks
said
we
to
make
for
the
old
windmill
and
then
draw
a
radius
of
six
miles
from
kergoff
to
avonporth
hurry
up
you
others
it
after
two
and
miss
harding
waiting
on
the
terrace
what
a
set
of
you
are
it
was
the
turn
of
vb
to
have
a
practical
geography
demonstration
and
they
started
therefore
under
the
guidance
of
the
second
mistress
to
survey
the
physical
features
of
a
certain
portion
of
the
neighbourhood
and
record
them
in
a
map
each
girl
was
furnished
by
miss
birks
with
a
paper
of
questions
intended
to
be
a
guide
to
her
observations
using
the
windmill
as
a
centre
what
direction
do
the
roads
take
what
villages
or
farms
must
be
noted
what
rivers
or
streams
and
their
courses
what
lakes
or
ponds
the
general
outline
of
the
coast
are
there
hills
or
mountains
what
historical
monuments
should
be
marked
with
a
cross
armed
with
their
instructions
pocket
compasses
and
the
girls
set
off
in
cheerful
spirits
they
dearly
loved
these
country
rambles
and
heartily
approved
of
this
particular
method
of
education
it
was
a
beautiful
bright
afternoon
towards
the
middle
of
february
one
of
those
glorious
days
that
seem
to
anticipate
the
spring
and
to
make
one
forget
that
winter
exists
at
all
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
blue
not
with
the
serene
blue
of
summer
but
with
that
fainter
almost
greenish
shade
so
noticeable
in
the
early
months
of
the
year
and
growing
where
it
touched
the
horizon
there
was
a
joyous
feeling
of
returning
life
in
the
air
a
thrush
perhaps
remembering
that
it
was
valentine
eve
carolled
with
full
rich
voice
in
the
bare
thorn
tree
small
birds
chased
each
other
among
the
bushes
and
great
flocks
of
rooks
were
feeding
up
and
down
the
ploughed
fields
in
sheltered
corners
an
early
wild
flower
or
two
had
forestalled
the
season
and
the
girls
picked
an
occasional
celandine
star
or
primrose
bud
and
even
a
few
cherished
violets
the
catkins
on
the
hazels
were
shaking
down
showers
of
golden
pollen
and
the
sallows
were
covered
with
silky
silvery
tufts
of
palm
the
low
sycamores
in
the
hedge
showed
rosy
buds
almost
ready
to
burst
and
shoots
of
bramble
or
sprays
of
honeysuckle
leaves
formed
green
patches
here
and
there
on
the
old
walls
the
girls
walked
at
a
brisk
swinging
pace
in
no
particular
order
so
long
as
they
kept
together
and
with
licence
to
stop
to
examine
specimens
within
reasonable
limits
of
time
miss
harding
who
was
herself
a
fairly
good
naturalist
might
be
consulted
at
any
moment
and
all
unknown
or
doubtful
objects
if
portable
were
popped
in
a
basket
and
taken
back
to
be
identified
by
the
supreme
authority
miss
birks
though
they
fully
appreciated
the
warren
as
a
playground
it
was
delightful
to
have
a
wider
field
for
their
activities
and
the
opportunity
of
making
some
fresh
find
or
some
interesting
discovery
to
report
at
miss
birks
kept
a
nature
diary
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
big
schoolroom
and
there
was
keen
competition
as
to
which
should
be
the
first
to
supply
the
various
items
that
made
up
its
weekly
chronicle
it
was
even
on
record
that
rhoda
wilkins
once
ran
a
whole
mile
at
top
speed
in
order
to
steal
a
march
on
emily
northwood
and
claim
for
va
the
proud
honour
of
announcing
the
first
bird
nest
of
the
year
the
special
point
for
which
the
girls
were
bound
this
afternoon
was
a
ruined
windmill
that
stood
on
a
small
eminence
and
formed
rather
a
landmark
in
the
district
from
here
an
excellent
view
might
be
obtained
of
both
the
outline
of
the
coast
and
the
course
of
the
little
river
that
ambled
down
from
the
hills
and
poured
itself
into
the
sea
by
the
tiny
village
of
kergoff
no
fitter
spot
could
have
been
chosen
for
a
general
survey
and
as
the
girls
reached
the
platform
on
which
the
building
stood
and
ranged
themselves
under
its
picturesque
ragged
sails
they
pulled
out
their
and
got
to
business
it
was
a
glorious
panorama
that
lay
below
them
brown
heathery
common
and
rugged
cliff
steep
crags
against
which
the
growing
tide
was
softly
lapping
a
babbling
little
river
that
wound
a
noisy
course
between
boulders
and
over
rounded
stones
tumbling
in
leaps
from
the
hills
dancing
through
the
meadows
and
flowing
with
a
strong
steady
swirl
through
the
whitewashed
hamlet
ere
it
widened
out
to
join
the
harbour
and
beyond
all
there
was
the
sea
the
shimmering
glittering
sea
rolling
quietly
in
with
slow
heavy
swell
and
dashing
with
a
dull
boom
against
the
lighthouse
rocks
bearing
far
off
on
its
bosom
a
chance
vessel
southward
bound
and
floating
one
by
one
the
little
craft
that
had
been
beached
in
the
anchorage
till
they
strained
at
their
cables
and
bobbed
gaily
on
the
rising
water
only
one
or
two
of
the
girls
perhaps
realized
the
intense
beauty
and
poetry
of
the
scene
most
were
busy
noting
the
natural
features
and
calculating
possible
distances
marking
here
a
farm
or
there
a
hill
crest
and
trying
to
reproduce
in
some
creditable
fashion
the
eccentric
windings
of
the
river
that
little
crag
below
us
just
blocks
the
view
of
the
road
said
deirdre
i
ca
get
the
bend
in
at
all
do
you
mind
miss
harding
if
some
of
us
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
trace
it
out
certainly
if
you
like
replied
the
mistress
i
tired
so
i
shall
wait
for
you
here
it
wo
take
you
longer
than
ten
minutes
oh
dear
no
we
race
down
i
say
who
come
dulcie
betty
annie
barbara
and
gerda
were
among
the
energetically
disposed
but
evie
romola
and
elyned
preferred
to
wait
with
miss
harding
we
copy
yours
when
you
come
back
they
announced
shamelessly
oh
we
see
about
that
cried
the
others
as
they
started
at
a
fair
pace
down
the
hill
the
road
was
certainly
the
most
winding
of
any
they
had
attempted
to
trace
that
afternoon
it
twisted
like
a
between
high
banks
then
hiding
beneath
a
steep
crag
plunged
suddenly
through
a
small
fir
wood
and
crossed
the
river
by
a
stone
bridge
the
girls
had
descended
at
a
jog
trot
trying
to
take
their
bearings
as
they
went
owing
to
the
great
height
of
the
banks
it
was
impossible
to
see
what
was
below
therefore
it
was
only
when
they
had
passed
the
wood
that
they
noticed
for
the
first
time
an
old
grey
house
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
it
was
built
so
close
to
the
stream
that
its
long
veranda
actually
overhung
the
water
which
swept
swirling
against
the
lower
wall
of
the
building
many
years
must
have
passed
since
it
last
held
a
tenant
for
creepers
stretched
long
tendrils
over
the
broken
windows
and
grass
grew
green
in
the
gutters
the
dilapidated
gate
the
garden
the
paintless
woodwork
the
walls
the
damaged
roof
all
gave
it
an
air
of
almost
indescribable
melancholy
so
utterly
abandoned
deserted
and
entirely
neglected
did
it
appear
hallo
why
this
must
be
folly
exclaimed
barbara
i
no
idea
we
were
so
close
to
it
we
could
see
even
the
chimneys
from
the
windmill
what
an
extraordinary
name
for
an
even
more
extraordinary
house
said
deirdre
who
in
the
name
of
all
that
weird
was
and
why
is
this
place
called
his
folly
he
was
a
lawyer
in
the
neighbourhood
i
believe
and
like
some
lawyers
just
a
little
bit
too
sharp
it
was
when
the
railway
was
going
to
be
made
he
heard
it
was
coming
this
way
and
he
calculated
it
would
just
have
to
cut
across
this
piece
of
land
so
he
bought
the
field
and
built
this
house
on
it
in
a
tremendous
hurry
because
he
thought
he
could
claim
big
compensation
from
the
railway
company
and
then
after
all
they
took
the
line
round
by
avonporth
instead
five
miles
away
and
did
want
to
buy
his
precious
house
so
he
had
all
the
trouble
and
expense
for
nothing
served
him
right
grunted
the
girls
they
say
he
was
furious
continued
barbara
he
was
so
disgusted
that
he
never
even
painted
the
woodwork
or
laid
out
the
garden
properly
he
tried
to
let
it
but
nobody
wanted
it
so
he
was
obliged
to
come
and
live
in
it
himself
for
economy
sake
he
was
an
old
bachelor
and
he
and
a
sour
old
housekeeper
were
here
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
he
died
very
suddenly
and
rather
mysteriously
his
relations
came
and
took
away
the
furniture
but
they
have
been
able
to
sell
the
house
it
in
such
a
queer
place
then
everybody
in
the
neighbourhood
said
it
was
haunted
and
not
a
soul
would
go
near
it
for
love
or
money
it
looks
haunted
said
dulcie
with
a
shiver
just
the
kind
of
place
where
you
expect
to
see
a
in
at
the
window
never
saw
anything
so
spooky
in
my
life
before
agreed
deirdre
did
you
say
it
used
to
belong
to
forster
the
lawyer
asked
gerda
the
one
who
had
business
at
st
gonstan
i
do
know
where
he
had
business
but
it
was
certainly
forster
the
lawyer
i
do
suppose
there
be
more
than
one
when
did
he
die
about
five
years
ago
i
fancy
why
do
you
want
to
know
oh
nothing
it
does
matter
in
the
least
returned
gerda
shrinking
into
her
shell
again
it
the
weirdest
queerest
place
i
ever
seen
said
deirdre
do
let
go
a
little
nearer
ugh
what
would
you
take
to
spend
a
night
here
alone
nothing
in
the
wide
world
you
could
offer
me
protested
betty
i
go
stark
staring
mad
affirmed
annie
hallo
squealed
dulcie
suddenly
what
become
of
gerda
sneaked
off
why
there
she
is
peeping
through
one
of
the
broken
windows
oh
i
say
i
must
have
a
squint
too
to
see
if
there
really
a
ghost
fluttered
annie
you
goose
you
would
see
ghosts
by
daylight
well
i
do
care
anyhow
i
going
to
peep
cuckoo
gerda
what
can
you
see
inside
when
annie
pridwell
led
the
way
it
followed
of
necessity
that
the
others
went
after
her
so
they
scurried
to
catch
her
up
and
all
ran
in
a
body
over
the
bridge
and
into
the
garden
gerda
was
still
perched
on
the
of
one
of
the
lower
rooms
and
she
turned
to
her
schoolfellows
with
a
strange
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
look
of
unwonted
excitement
on
her
face
i
put
my
hand
through
the
broken
pane
and
pulled
back
the
catch
she
volunteered
we
only
to
push
the
window
up
and
we
could
go
inside
oh
dare
we
suppose
the
ghost
caught
us
oh
i
say
do
let
us
go
it
would
be
such
gorgeous
sport
i
game
if
you
all
are
as
usual
it
was
annie
pridwell
who
led
the
adventure
pushing
up
the
window
she
climbed
over
the
sill
and
dropped
inside
then
turning
round
offered
a
hand
to
gerda
who
sprang
eagerly
after
her
it
was
imperative
for
deirdre
dulcie
betty
and
barbara
to
follow
they
were
not
going
to
be
outdone
in
courage
and
they
felt
that
at
any
rate
there
was
safety
in
numbers
there
was
nothing
very
terrible
about
the
in
which
they
found
themselves
it
only
looked
miserable
and
forlorn
with
the
damp
paper
hanging
in
strips
from
the
walls
and
heaps
of
straw
left
by
the
remover
men
strewn
about
the
floor
we
go
and
explore
the
rest
of
the
house
said
annie
with
a
chuckle
come
along
anybody
who
game
nobody
wished
to
remain
behind
alone
so
they
went
all
together
holding
each
other
arms
squealing
or
gasping
or
giggling
as
occasion
prompted
they
peeped
into
the
empty
and
the
silent
kitchen
where
the
grate
was
red
with
rust
hurried
past
a
dark
hall
cupboard
and
found
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
oh
i
dare
go
up
i
simply
dare
bleated
barbara
piteously
suppose
the
ghost
lives
up
there
suggested
betty
my
good
girl
no
spook
likes
to
make
an
exhibition
of
itself
returned
annie
the
sight
of
six
of
us
would
scare
it
away
i
do
mean
to
say
i
go
alone
but
now
we
all
here
it
different
we
been
more
than
miss
harding
ten
minutes
vacillated
deirdre
oh
bother
one
does
often
get
the
chance
to
explore
come
along
you
sillies
what
are
you
frightened
at
so
together
they
mounted
the
stairs
and
took
a
hasty
survey
of
the
upper
story
here
the
remover
men
had
evidently
done
their
work
even
more
carelessly
than
down
below
for
though
the
furniture
had
been
taken
away
enough
rubbish
had
been
left
to
provide
a
rummage
sale
all
kinds
of
old
articles
not
worth
removing
were
lying
where
they
had
been
thrown
down
on
the
bedroom
floor
old
curtains
old
shoes
scraps
of
mouldy
carpet
the
laths
of
venetian
blinds
broken
lamp
shades
empty
bottles
torn
magazines
cracked
pottery
brushes
and
decrepit
straw
palliasses
did
you
ever
see
such
an
extraordinary
conglomeration
of
queer
things
said
annie
i
wonder
they
did
tidy
the
house
up
before
they
went
no
wonder
nobody
would
take
it
and
look
girls
they
actually
left
a
whole
bathful
of
old
letters
somebody
has
begun
to
tear
them
up
and
not
finished
they
ought
to
have
burnt
them
just
look
at
this
piece
it
has
a
lovely
crest
on
it
oh
has
it
give
it
to
me
i
collecting
crests
cried
deirdre
commandeering
the
scrap
of
paper
it
a
jolly
one
too
i
say
are
there
any
more
move
out
annie
and
let
me
see
look
here
remonstrated
barbara
i
do
think
we
ought
to
go
rummaging
amongst
old
letters
it
does
seem
quite
quite
honourable
does
it
they
are
not
ours
annie
i
wish
you
stop
no
gerda
look
at
them
please
oh
i
say
i
wish
you
all
come
away
let
go
miss
harding
will
think
we
drowned
in
the
river
or
something
and
at
any
rate
she
scold
us
no
end
for
being
so
long
do
you
know
the
time
there
was
certainly
force
in
barbara
remarks
their
ten
minutes
leave
had
exceeded
half
an
hour
and
miss
harding
would
undoubtedly
require
a
substantial
reason
for
their
delay
oh
goody
it
four
chirruped
betty
i
no
idea
it
was
so
late
we
do
want
to
get
into
a
row
with
miss
birks
i
believe
i
hear
romola
shouting
in
the
road
they
come
to
look
for
us
we
best
scoot
then
said
annie
and
flinging
back
the
letters
into
the
bath
she
turned
with
the
rest
and
clattered
downstairs
miss
harding
grave
annoyed
and
justly
indignant
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
bridge
she
received
them
with
the
scolding
they
merited
where
have
you
been
you
naughty
naughty
girls
you
not
to
be
trusted
a
minute
out
of
my
sight
i
gave
you
permission
to
go
straight
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
back
and
here
you
been
away
more
than
half
an
hour
what
were
you
doing
in
that
garden
you
had
no
right
there
come
along
this
instant
and
walk
before
me
two
and
two
miss
birks
will
have
to
hear
about
this
a
nice
report
to
take
back
of
your
afternoon
work
at
map
drawing
map
drawing
they
had
forgotten
all
about
the
maps
the
girls
looked
at
one
another
and
deirdre
with
an
awful
pang
realized
that
she
had
left
her
on
the
mantelpiece
of
the
she
had
been
disposed
to
titter
before
but
she
felt
now
that
the
affair
was
no
joking
matter
miss
harding
must
know
we
been
inside
the
house
she
whispered
to
gerda
with
whom
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
she
had
paired
off
no
one
likely
to
tell
her
and
she
could
see
us
come
out
of
the
window
from
where
she
was
standing
returned
gerda
we
shall
get
into
trouble
enough
as
it
is
i
did
think
miss
harding
would
have
cut
up
so
rough
about
it
i
say
just
think
of
leaving
those
old
letters
all
lying
about
i
got
one
at
least
it
a
scrap
of
one
with
a
lovely
crest
a
boar
head
and
a
lot
of
stars
all
in
gold
what
gasped
gerda
did
you
say
you
found
that
on
a
letter
well
it
a
piece
of
a
letter
anyway
oh
do
let
me
see
it
is
miss
harding
looking
well
here
it
is
be
careful
she
got
her
eye
on
us
oh
give
it
me
back
quick
gerda
had
turned
the
scrap
of
paper
over
and
was
glancing
at
the
writing
on
the
other
side
she
reddened
with
annoyance
as
deirdre
snatched
back
her
treasure
let
me
see
it
again
she
pleaded
no
no
it
safe
in
my
pocket
better
not
run
any
risks
you
might
give
it
to
me
i
collecting
crests
a
likely
idea
do
you
think
if
i
wanted
to
part
with
it
i
present
it
to
you
no
i
mean
to
keep
it
myself
thanks
i
buy
it
if
you
like
i
do
sell
my
things
not
if
i
offered
something
nice
not
for
anything
you
offer
me
returned
deirdre
whose
temper
was
in
a
touchy
condition
and
her
spirit
of
opposition
thoroughly
aroused
we
do
haggle
over
our
things
at
the
dower
house
whatever
you
may
do
in
germany
gerda
said
no

at
night
in
their
bedroom
she
returned
once
more
to
the
subject
you
wo
get
it
if
you
bother
me
to
the
end
of
the
term
declared
deirdre
locking
up
the
bone
of
contention
in
her
and
putting
the
key
in
her
pocket
what
do
you
want
it
for
so
particularly
gerda
asked
dulcie
sharply
oh
nothing
only
a
fancy
of
my
own
replied
gerda
reddening
with
one
of
her
sudden
fits
of
blushing
as
she
turned
to
the
and
began
to
comb
her
flaxen
hair
chapter

ragtime
if
there
was
one
thing
more
than
another
that
the
girls
of
the
dower
house
considered
a
particular
and
pressing
grievance
it
was
a
wet
saturday
afternoon
they
were
all
of
them
outdoor
enthusiasts
and
to
be
obliged
to
stop
in
the
house
instead
of
tramping
the
moors
or
roaming
on
the
was
regarded
as
a
supreme
penance
on
the
saturday
following
the
mapping
expedition
there
was
no
mistake
about
the
rain
it
seemed
to
come
down
in
a
solid
sheet
from
a
murky
sky
which
offered
absolutely
no
prospect
of
clearing
the
overflowing
emptied
veritable
rivulets
into
a
temporary
pond
on
the
front
drive
the
lawn
appeared
fast
turning
into
a
morass
and
even
indoors
the
atmosphere
was
so
soaked
with
damp
that
a
dewy
film
covered
banisters
furniture
and
woodwork
and
the
on
the
stairs
distinctly
changed
its
hue
in
vb
classroom
the
girls
hung
about
disconsolately
there
was
to
have
been
a
special
fossil
foray
that
afternoon
under
the
leadership
of
a
lady
from
perranwrack
who
took
an
interest
in
the
school
and
who
had
thrown
out
hints
of
a
fire
of
driftwood
and
a
picnic
tea
among
the
rocks
it
so
particularly
aggravating
because
miss
hall
has
to
go
up
to
london
on
monday
and
wo
be
back
for
weeks
so
probably
she
wo
be
able
to
arrange
to
take
us
again
this
term
grumbled
romola
it
too
too
murmured
deirdre
in
a
voice
arranging
a
cushion
behind
her
head
with
elaborate
show
of
indolence
weally
wetched
echoed
dulcie
lackadaisically
sinking
into
the
with
an
even
more
air
than
her
chum
good
old
second
best
laughed
betty
whom
are
you
both
copying
now
have
you
been
gobbling
a
surreptitious
penny
novelette
i
can
generally
tell
your
course
of
reading
from
your
poses
these
present
airs
and
graces
suggest
some
such
title
as
rosamond
mystery
or
earl
secret
confess
now
you
imagining
yourselves
members
of
the
aristocracy
i
believe
the
penny
novelettes
are
invariably
written
in
top
garrets
by
people
who
never
even
had
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
dukes
and
duchesses
said
barbara
the
real
article
very
different
from
the
earl
of
fiction
the
type
is
extinct
now
if
you
were
a
genuine
countess
deirdre
you
probably
be
addressing
hundreds
of
envelopes
in
aid
of
a
philanthropic
society
instead
of
lounging
there
looking
like
a
dying
duck
in
a
thunderstorm
do
glare
i
speak
the
solemn
words
of
truth
you
make
my
he
head
ache
protested
deirdre
with
eyelids
but
her
complaint
met
with
no
sympathy
instead
several
strong
and
insistent
hands
pulled
her
forcibly
out
of
her
chair
and
flung
away
the
cushion
i
tell
you
we
sick
of
isobel
or
whoever
she
may
be
for
goodness
sake
be
somebody
more
cheerful
if
you
wo
be
yourself
you
get
up
an
irish
mood
for
a
change
a
bit
of
the
brogue
would
hearten
up
this
clammy
afternoon
oh
is
it
piggy
and
nasty
exclaimed
annie
stretching
out
her
arms
in
the
agony
of
an
elephantine
yawn
i
want
my
tea
i
want
my
tea
i
want
my
tea
and
i
sha
get
it
for
a
whole
long
weary
hour
poor
martyr
here
on
the
and
i
make
you
a
triscuit
what
on
earth
is
a
triscuit
oh
you
not
bright
or
you
guess
it
a
biscuit
toasted
nicely
brown
and
eaten
hot
do
you
twig
a
biscuit
means
cooked
therefore
if
it
cooked
again
it
must
be
a
triscuit
that
stands
to
reason
is
it
to
be
a
barmecide
feast
i
do
see
your
precious
biscuits
i
got
here
sez
she
quite
returned
betty
who
was
a
ewing
enthusiast
and
quoted
dame
datchet
with
relish
half
a
pound
of
cream
crackers
and
i
mean
to
be
generous
and
share
round
do
you
all
bless
me
now
the
question
is
how
we
going
to
them
the
girls
crowded
round
with
suggestions
toasting
biscuits
was
certainly
more
entertaining
than
doing
nothing
deirdre
forgot
for
the
time
that
she
was
a
heroine
of
fiction
and
plumped
down
by
the
fender
with
a
lack
of
dignity
that
would
have
scandalized
lady
isobel
you
smash
them
up
if
you
try
sticking
your
penknife
through
them
she
observed
it
burn
your
fingers
too
to
hold
them
so
close
to
the
fire
try
the
tongs
some
of
them
might
be
tilted
up
in
the
fender
volunteered
gerda
whose
rare
remarks
were
generally
to
the
point
they
be
getting
hot
and
we
could
finish
them
off
afterwards
right
you
are
stick
them
up
in
a
row
now
if
i
take
this
one
with
the
tongs
and
hold
it
just
over
that
red
piece
in
the
fire
be
careful
remember
it
fragile
there
i
knew
you
smash
it
oh
pick
the
other
half
out
quick
burning
what
a
you
are
it
done
for
in
the
end
and
it
was
gerda
quiet
suggestion
the
tongs
were
placed
over
the
fire
like
a
gridiron
and
the
biscuits
successfully
popped
on
the
top
and
turned
when
one
side
was
done
everybody
appreciated
them
down
to
the
last
crumb
and
awarded
betty
a
vote
of
thanks
for
her
brilliant
idea
the
worst
of
it
is
they
finished
too
soon
sighed
evie
and
nothing
else
to
fill
up
the
gap
till
i
want
to
do
something
outrageous
break
a
window
or
smash
an
ornament
or
damage
the
furniture
what
a
nuisance
conscience
is
why
does
the
restrain
me
probably
the
wholesome
dread
of
consequences
my
dear
you
might
cut
your
hand
in
a
wild
orgy
of
window
smashing
and
there
be
bills
to
pay
afterwards
for
reglazing
and
medical
attendance
but
ca
we
do
anything
interesting
let
play
a
trick
on
va
suggested
annie
it
would
do
them
good
and
shake
them
up
my
conscience
gives
me
full
leave
it
celebrated
for
its
elasticity
chuckled
evie
but
what
could
we
do
oh
just
rag
them
a
little
somehow
it
would
be
rather
sport
plans
for
sport
in
ragtime
wanted
all
offers
carefully
considered
now
then
bring
on
your
suggestions
everybody
stared
hopefully
at
everybody
else
but
no
one
rose
to
the
occasion
going
going
going
a
opportunity
for
could
we
get
them
into
the
passage
and
one
of
us
hide
behind
the
curtain
of
the
barred
room
and
act
ghost
proposed
romola
desperately
her
suggestion
however
was
received
with
utter
scorn
ca
you
think
of
anything
more
original
than
that
we
fed
up
with
that
ghost
trick
nobody
even
calls
it
funny
now
besides
miss
birks
said
she
punish
anyone
who
did
it
again
she
was
awfully
angry
last
time
duly
squashed
romola
subsided
and
the
silence
which
followed
resembled
that
of
a
quakers
meeting
i
got
it
shouted
betty
at
last
clapping
her
hands
ecstatically
the
very
thing
oh
the
supremest
joke
good
biz
but
please
condescend
to
explain
commented
evie
oh
we
try
what
call
it
mesmerism
that
the
word
i
want
with
dinner
plates
you
know
apparently
nobody
knew
for
all
looked
interested
and
intelligent
but
unenlightened
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
heard
of
it
oh
goody
what
luck
look
here
interposed
annie
you
not
going
to
rag
us
as
well
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
va
if
there
any
sell
about
it
all
right
they
really
be
enough
and
you
shall
act
audience
only
with
fourteen
of
you
it
would
have
been
so
betty
scott
give
us
your
word
this
instant
that
you
wo
play
tricks
on
your
own
form
i
wo
i
wo
honest
i
wo
and
tell
us
what
you
going
to
do
no
that
would
spoil
it
all
you
must
wait
and
see
barbara
go
to
the
kitchen
door
and
cajole
cook
into
lending
us
seven
dinner
plates
say
you
pledge
your
honour
not
to
break
them
and
purloin
a
candle
from
the
lamp
cupboard
be
as
quick
as
you
can
time
wanes
barbara
executed
her
errand
with
speed
and
success
she
soon
returned
with
the
plates
and
set
them
down
on
the
table
betty
lighted
the
candle
laid
one
plate
aside
then
held
each
of
the
others
in
turn
over
the
flame
till
the
bottoms
inside
the
rims
were
well
coloured
with
smoke
the
girls
watched
her
curiously
now
i
ready
she
announced
but
i
want
a
messenger
elyned
you
go
and
tap
at
va
door
and
say
we
shall
be
very
pleased
if
they
care
to
come
and
try
a
most
interesting
experiment
mind
you
put
it
politely
and
for
your
life
do
snigger
now
va
had
been
spending
an
even
duller
and
more
wearisome
afternoon
than
vb
for
they
had
not
had
the
diversion
of
toasting
biscuits
they
were
yawning
in
the
last
stages
of
boredom
when
elyned
arrived
and
delivered
her
message
usually
they
considered
themselves
far
too
select
to
have
much
to
do
with
the
lower
division
but
anything
to
break
the
monotony
was
welcome
they
accepted
the
invitation
with
alacrity
and
came
trooping
in
to
the
rival
classroom
with
pleased
anticipation
in
their
faces
it
a
most
curious
experiment
began
betty
i
learnt
it
from
a
cousin
who
been
out
east
he
saw
it
practised
by
some
chinese
priests
at
a
josshouse
i
believe
it
one
of
the
first
steps
of
initiation
in
esoteric
buddhism
my
cousin
not
exactly
a
theosophist
but
interested
in
comparative
theologies
and
he
went
about
with
a
lama
and
found
out
ever
so
many
of
their
secrets
he
wrote
down
the
formulary
of
this
for
me
what
it
about
asked
the
elder
girls
looking
considerably
impressed
it
a
species
of
mesmerism
or
animal
magnetism
as
some
people
prefer
to
call
it
you
make
certain
passes
and
repeat
certain
words
after
me
and
then
you
all
get
into
the
hypnotic
state
of
course
it
depends
how
psychic
you
are
but
anybody
with
even
undeveloped
mediumistic
powers
will
sometimes
give
replies
to
questions
they
could
possibly
answer
in
the
normal
state
i
suppose
it
wo
hurt
us
asked
agnes
gillard
rather
gravely
oh
not
at
all
it
wonderful
sometimes
to
find
how
people
never
even
suspected
they
possessed
psychic
gifts
bring
out
absolutely
unaccountable
pieces
of
information
it
really
would
be
quite
uncanny
except
for
the
latest
theory
that
it
merely
utilizing
a
natural
power
once
cultivated
by
man
but
long
forgotten
except
by
a
few
priests
in
the
tibetan
monasteries
the
theosophical
society
of
course
is
trying
to
revive
it
i
afraid
i
do
know
anything
about
theosophy
murmured
hilda
marriott
it
akin
to
the
eleusinian
mysteries
and
the
cult
of
isis
continued
betty
unblushingly
you
have
to
understand
reincarnation
and
that
flitting
about
in
your
astral
body
while
you
asleep
and
and
but
here
both
memory
and
invention
failed
her
so
she
hurriedly
changed
her
point
oh
it
would
take
me
years
to
explain
and
you
could
understand
unless
you
been
initiated
let
get
to
the
experiment
will
you
all
stand
in
a
row
are
any
of
you
going
to
try
asked
irene
jordan
addressing
the
members
of
vb
who
solemn
as
judges
stood
slightly
in
the
background
we
can
only
do
it
with
seven
the
mystic
number
and
there
are
eight
of
them
and
they
ca
agree
who
to
be
left
out
said
betty
hurriedly
it
always
done
with
six
neophytes
and
one
initiated
if
you
ready
we
best
begin
and
not
waste
any
more
time
she
arranged
her
neophytes
in
a
line
and
gave
to
each
a
plate
telling
her
to
hold
it
firmly
in
the
left
hand
then
taking
her
stand
facing
them
she
raised
her
own
plate
to
the
level
of
her
chest
now
you
must
do
exactly
as
i
do
she
commanded
all
fix
your
eyes
on
me
and
do
take
them
off
me
for
a
single
instant
the
concentration
of
the
seven
visual
currents
is
of
vital
importance
put
the
middle
finger
of
the
right
hand
beneath
the
plate
exactly
in
the
centre
then
describe
a
circle
with
it
on
the
under
side
of
the
plate
be
sure
the
circle
follows
the
same
course
as
the
sun
or
we
may
break
the
mesmeric
current
watch
what
i
doing
now
describe
a
circle
on
your
face
in
the
same
manner
beginning
with
the
left
cheek
copy
me
carefully
and
now
we
must
repeat

let
us
say
it
slowly
all
together
seven
times
performing
the
orthodox
circles
at
each
the
neophytes
played
their
parts
admirably
they
never
removed
their
gaze
from
the
face
of
their
instructress
they
copied
her
every
movement
and
repeated
the
mystic
words
to
the
very
best
of
their
ability
om
mani
padme
hum
rolled
from
their
lips
seven
times
and
seemed
to
suggest
the
dreamy
atmosphere
of
the
occult
the
mesmeric
current
is
forming
i
can
feel
it
working
declared
betty
it
only
requires
further
visualization
for
the
hypnotic
state
to
follow
to
complete
the
magnetic
circle
will
you
all
kindly
turn
and
face
each
other
still
holding
the
plates
the
obedient
six
swung
round
stared
at
one
another
then
gasped
and
shrieked
and
well
they
might
for
one
and
all
their
countenances
were
besmirched
with
black
in
a
series
of
concentric
rings
which
caused
them
to
resemble
zulu
chiefs
or
warriors
on
the
warpath
oh
oh
oh
came
from
the
members
of
vb
who
having
been
stationed
behind
the
neophytes
had
been
in
equal
ignorance
of
the
trick
that
was
being
played
on
them
then
everybody
exploded
oh
you
look
so
funny
is
the
magnetic
current
working
is
it
the
cult
of
isis
oh
my
heart
oh
ho
ho
gurgled

your

oh

so
indignant
or
you
kill

i
got

in

with
laughing

for

but
do
have

handing
the
packet
round
among
the
outraged

seemed
to
warrant
some

of
compensation

sacrificed
a

blissfully
sucking

allowed

to

mollified

pleasure
of

company

the
young
ladies
of
miss
birks
seminary
to
drink
tea
with
her
on
the
occasion
of
the
natal
day
of
her
nephew
master
ronald
trevellyan
announced
evie
changing
suddenly
to
a
ceremonious
manner
and
dropping
a
stiff
curtsy
ronnie
birthday
oh
what
sport
it
on
wednesday
has
she
asked
only
us
no
the
whole
school
is
to
go
mistresses
and
all
returned
evie
trevellyan
wants
to
introduce
ronnie
new
governess
to
us
there
are
sure
to
be
games
and
perhaps
a
competition
with
prizes
rejoiced
annie
pridwell
and
we
always
have
delicious
teas
at
the
castle
gerda
thorwaldson
why
do
you
look
pleased
you
take
it
as
quietly
as
if
it
were
a
parochial
meeting
what
a
mum
mouse
you
are
is
it
anything
to
get
so
excited
over
replied
gerda
calmly
of
course
it
is
the
castle
the
castle
and
trevellyan
is
well
just
trevellyan
there
are
the
loveliest
things
there
foreign
curiosities
and
old
pictures
and
illuminated
books
and
we
allowed
to
look
at
them
and
there
special
preserved
ginger
from
china
and
boxes
of
real
eastern
turkish
delight
oh
it
a
fairy
palace
you
may
thank
your
stars
you
going
in
spite
of
annie
transports
gerda
did
not
look
particularly
delighted
she
only
smiled
in
a
rather
sickly
fashion
and
said
nothing
the
others
however
were
much
too
occupied
with
their
own
pleasurable
expectations
to
take
any
notice
of
her
lack
of
enthusiasm
they
had
accepted
her
quiet
ways
as
part
of
herself
and
had
set
her
down
as
a
not
very
interesting
addition
to
the
form
and
thought
her
opinions
if
indeed
she
possessed
any
were
of
scant
importance
gerda
had
made
very
little
headway
with
her
companions
her
intense
reserve
seemed
to
set
a
barrier
between
them
and
herself
and
after
one
or
two
efforts
at
being
friendly
the
girls
had
given
her
up
and
took
no
more
trouble
over
her
gerda
the
silent
the
recluse
the
oyster
were
some
of
the
names
by
which
she
was
known
and
she
certainly
justified
every
item
of
her
reputation
for
reticence
if
she
did
not
talk
much
she
was
however
a
good
listener
nothing
in
the
merry
chat
of
the
schoolroom
escaped
her
and
anybody
who
had
been
curious
enough
to
watch
her
carefully
might
have
noticed
that
often
when
seemingly
buried
in
a
book
her
eyes
did
not
move
over
the
page
and
all
her
attention
was
given
to
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
in
her
vicinity
having
received
an
invitation
to
ronnie
birthday
party
of
course
the
burning
subject
of
discussion
was
what
to
give
him
as
a
present
miss
birks
vetoed
the
idea
of
each
girl
making
a
separate
offering
and
suggested
a
general
subscription
list
to
buy
one
handsome
article
it
will
be
quite
sufficient
and
i
am
sure
trevellyan
would
far
rather
have
it
so
she
decreed
it
too
bad
for
i
made
up
my
mind
to
give
him
a
box
of
soldiers
complained
annie
in
private
and
i
a
book
in
my
eye
said
elyned
perhaps
miss
birks
is
right
said
romola
because
you
see
some
of
us
might
give
nicer
presents
than
the
others
and
perhaps
there
be
a
little
jealousy
and
at
any
rate
comparisons
are
odious
miss
birks
has
limited
the
subscriptions
to
a
shilling
each
commented
deirdre
then
let
take
our
list
now
i
write
down
our
names
and
you
can
tell
me
the
amounts
for
such
an
object
everyone
was
disposed
to
be
liberal
everyone
that
is
to
say
except
gerda
thorwaldson
when
she
was
applied
to
she
flatly
refused
do
you
want
to
join
in
the
present
to
ronnie
gasped
romola
in
utter
amazement
why
should
i
why
because
we
going
to
tea
at
the
castle
and
ronnie
is
ronnie
and
trevellyan
will
be
pleased
too
i
do
know
mrs
trevellyan
well
you
soon
will
you
be
introduced
to
her
on
wednesday
she
always
says
something
nice
to
new
girls
asks
them
where
their
homes
are
and
if
they
brothers
and
sisters
and
how
old
they
are
and
if
she
finds
out
she
knows
their
parents
or
their
friends
she
so
interested
and
she
has
such
a
good
memory
for
faces
she
actually
recognized
irene
jordan
although
she
never
seen
her
in
her
life
before
because
irene
is
so
like
an
aunt
a
miss
jordan
who
is
a
friend
of
mrs
trevellyan
gerda
had
turned
a
dull
crimson
at
these
remarks
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
and
made
no
reply
what
her
inward
thoughts
might
be
no
one
could
fathom
is
your
name
to
go
down
at
all
then
on
the
list
asked
romola
with
considerable
impatience
no
thanks
replied
gerda
briefly
turning
awkwardly
away
wednesday
arrived
and
perhaps
even
ronnie
hardly
welcomed
his
birthday
more
than
did
his
friends
at
the
dower
house
his
present
a
toy
circus
had
arrived
and
had
been
on
exhibition
in
miss
birks
study
and
everybody
had
agreed
that
it
was
the
very
thing
to
please
him
at
three
the
girls
went
to
change
their
school
dresses
for
more
festive
attire
and
were
more
than
ordinarily
particular
in
their
choice
of
preparations
how
slow
you
are
gerda
thorwaldson
said
deirdre
whose
own
immaculate
toilet
was
complete
you
have
put
on
your
dress
yet
why
do
you
hurry
you
need
think
we
wait
for
you
added
dulcie
instead
of
replying
gerda
calmly
donned
her
and
volunteering
no
explanation
went
out
of
the
room
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
she
walked
downstairs
to
miss
birks
study
and
tapping
at
the
door
reported
herself
may
i
please
stay
at
home
this
afternoon
she
begged
i
afraid
i
do
feel
up
to
going
out
to
tea
not
go
to
the
castle
my
dear
child
i
hope
you
not
ill
certainly
stay
at
home
and
lie
down
on
your
bed
if
your
head
aches
nettie
shall
bring
your
tea
upstairs
i
sorry
you
miss
so
great
a
treat
as
a
visit
to
mrs
trevellyan
gerda
made
no
comment
but
as
she
was
habitually
sparing
of
speech
her
silence
did
not
strike
miss
birks
as
anything
unusual
it
was
time
to
start
and
the
principal
had
her
nineteen
other
pupils
to
think
about
so
she
dismissed
the
with
a
final
injunction
to
rest
gerda
did
not
return
to
her
bedroom
till
she
was
perfectly
sure
that
deirdre
and
dulcie
had
left
it
she
had
no
wish
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
their
inevitable
criticisms
or
to
be
questioned
too
closely
on
the
nature
of
her
sudden
indisposition
she
loitered
about
the
upper
landing
until
from
the
end
window
she
saw
the
whole
school
girls
mistresses
and
principal
file
down
the
drive
and
out
through
the
gate
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
then
going
to
her
dormitory
she
rang
the
bell
and
lay
down
on
her
bed
would
you
mind
bringing
my
cup
of
tea
now
nettie
please
she
asked
when
the
housemaid
appeared
and
then
i
should
like
to
be
left
perfectly
quiet
until
the
others
come
back
of
course
i
bring
it
miss
said
the
sympathetic
nettie
nothing
like
a
cup
of
tea
for
a
headache
the
kettle
on
the
boil
so
you
can
have
it
at
once
i
wo
be
more
than
a
minute
or
two
fetching
it
nettie
was
as
prompt
as
her
word
she
returned
almost
directly
with
the
tea
and
arranged
it
temptingly
on
a
little
table
by
the
bedside
shut
your
eyes
and
try
and
go
to
sleep
when
you
drunk
it
she
recommended
you
perhaps
wake
up
quite
fresh
it
is
a
pity
you
could
go
with
the
other
young
ladies
to
the
castle
they
were
all
so
full
of
it
and
master
ronnie
birthday
too
i
know
how
disappointed
you
must
feel
gerda
finished
her
tea
far
more
rapidly
than
is
usual
for
invalids
with
then
instead
of
taking
nettie
advice
and
closing
her
eyes
she
rose
and
put
on
her
school
dress
her
coat
and
her
cap
she
opened
the
door
and
listened
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
the
servants
must
surely
be
having
their
own
tea
in
the
kitchen
and
no
one
else
was
in
the
house
with
extreme
caution
she
crept
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
the
side
door
was
open
and
as
quietly
as
a
shadow
she
passed
out
and
dodged
round
the
corner
of
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
running
running
at
the
very
top
of
her
speed
across
the
warren
in
the
direction
of
a
certain
rocky
creek
not
far
from
well
when
the
girls
returned
at
six
full
of
their
experiences
they
found
gerda
lying
on
her
bed
with
the
blind
drawn
down
there
was
an
almost
feverish
colour
in
her
cheeks
we
a
ripping
time
dulcie
assured
her
a
splendid
competition
i
nearly
got
a
prize
but
i
put
down
for
one
and
it
was
really
a
piece
of
the
skin
of
a
emily
northwood
won
the
first
with
sixteen
objects
right
out
of
twenty
and
hilda
marriott
was
second
with
fourteen
i
might
have
known
that
specimen
was
fish
scales
ronnie
was
delighted
with
his
circus
added
dulcie
he
gave
us
each
a
kiss
all
round
and
trevellyan
was
so
nice
she
was
sorry
you
could
come
and
hoped
she
see
you
some
other
time
by
the
by
your
headache
rather
better
i
think
i
get
up
now
murmured
gerda
i
touched
my
latin
plucky
of
you
to
come
and
do
prep
if
i
had
a
headache
would
i
just
make
it
an
excuse
to
knock
off
virgil
it
was
getting
near
to
the
end
of
february
the
days
were
lengthening
visibly
and
the
sun
which
only
a
month
ago
had
appeared
every
morning
like
a
red
ball
over
the
hill
behind
the
castle
now
rose
bright
and
shining
a
long
way
to
eastward
in
spite
of
occasional
spring
storms
the
weather
was
on
the
whole
mild
and
every
day
fresh
flowers
were
pushing
up
in
the
school
garden
the
warren
attractive
even
in
winter
was
doubly
delightful
now
primrose
tufts
were
venturing
to
show
among
the
last
year
bracken
and
the
gorse
was
beginning
to
gleam
golden
in
sheltered
stretches
the
girls
were
out
every
available
moment
of
their
spare
time
rambling
over
the
headland
or
haunting
the
for
most
of
them
the
latter
provided
the
greater
entertainment
they
had
discovered
a
new
occupation
that
of
salvaging
the
driftwood
and
found
it
so
enthralling
that
for
the
present
it
overtopped
all
other
amusements
the
high
and
occasional
storms
washed
up
quantities
of
pieces
of
timber
and
to
rescue
these
from
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
carry
them
into
a
place
of
safety
became
as
keen
a
sport
as
fishing
quite
a
little
was
accumulating
under
the
cliff
and
the
girls
had
designs
of
carrying
it
piece
by
piece
to
a
point
on
the
top
of
the
headland
and
there
building
a
beacon
of
noble
proportions
to
be
fired
on
empire
day
amid
suitable
rejoicings
it
was
exciting
work
to
skip
about
at
the
water
edge
grasping
at
bits
of
old
spars
or
shattered
boards
the
sea
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fun
and
would
bob
them
near
and
snatch
them
away
in
tantalizing
fashion
sometimes
adding
a
wetting
as
a
point
to
the
joke
to
secure
a
fine
piece
of
wood
without
getting
into
the
water
was
the
triumph
of
skill
attended
with
considerable
risk
not
to
life
or
limb
but
to
length
of
recreation
for
miss
birks
had
laid
down
an
inviolable
rule
that
anybody
who
got
her
feet
wet
at
this
occupation
must
immediately
return
to
school
change
shoes
and
stockings
and
desist
from
further
attempts
on
that
day
one
or
two
of
the
girls
were
lucky
enough
to
possess
wading
boots
with
which
they
could
venture
to
defy
father
ocean
and
rob
him
of
some
of
the
choicest
of
his
spoils
but
they
were
the
few
the
rank
and
file
had
to
content
themselves
with
the
ordinary
method
of
swift
snatching
with
the
aid
of
a
hockey
stick
two
days
after
ronnie
birthday
party
a
strong
wind
and
squall
during
the
night
had
furnished
material
for
more
than
usually
good
sport
and
the
whole
school
betook
itself
to
the
beach
to
try
to
reap
a
harvest
laughing
joking
squealing
the
girls
pursued
their
quarry
enjoying
the
fun
all
the
more
for
the
accidents
of
the
moment
evie
bennett
dropped
her
hockey
stick
and
nearly
lost
it
altogether
romola
harvey
slipped
and
fell
flat
into
a
pool
of
water
and
many
other
minor
mishaps
occurred
to
keep
up
the
excitement
until
the
catch
of
the
year
was
secured
a
large
piece
of
timber
which
it
took
the
united
efforts
of
all
arms
to
drag
successfully
up
the
beach
deirdre
and
dulcie
at
last
grown
reckless
ventured
a
risky
experiment
on
their
own
account
with
the
result
that
a
wave
caught
them
neatly
and
gave
them
the
full
benefit
of
treatment
oh
you
done
for
go
back
at
once
commanded
jessie
macpherson
the
head
girl
whose
office
it
was
to
see
that
the
rule
about
changing
shoes
was
duly
observed
does
hurt
protested
the
chums
your
feet
are
wet
through
so
back
you
trot
this
instant
do
you
want
me
to
report
you
very
loath
to
leave
the
shore
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
nevertheless
bound
to
obey
so
they
toiled
regretfully
up
the
steep
path
from
the
cove
casting
a
lingering
eye
on
their
companions
who
were
still
hard
at
work
where
gerda
asked
dulcie
she
not
down
there
and
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
seen
her
for
the
last
or
more
did
she
get
wet
i
really
did
notice
i
suppose
she
must
have
and
been
sent
back
we
shall
probably
find
her
in
the
garden
the
two
stepped
briskly
over
the
warren
their
shoes
drying
on
their
feet
with
a
rapidity
which
made
them
disparage
miss
birks
excellent
rule
about
changing
it
just
her
fuss
we
should
have
taken
no
harm
said
deirdre
i
say
surely
that
ronnie
laugh
i
know
it
anywhere
where
is
the
child
the
girls
were
passing
close
to
the
high
wall
which
separated
the
castle
grounds
from
the
warren
and
as
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
ronnie
was
inside
playing
in
the
garden
they
managed
with
considerable
effort
and
the
aid
of
some
strong
ivy
to
climb
to
the
top
and
peep
over
here
a
most
unexpected
sight
met
their
gaze
on
the
grass
under
a
tamarisk
bush
sat
gerda
with
ronnie
on
her
knee
she
had
evidently
made
friends
with
the
little
fellow
to
a
great
extent
for
he
seemed
very
much
at
home
with
her
and
the
two
were
laughing
and
joking
together
in
the
most
intimate
fashion
it
was
such
an
absolutely
new
aspect
of
gerda
that
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
dumb
with
amazement
when
at
the
dower
house
had
she
laughed
so
gaily
or
talked
in
so
animated
and
sprightly
a
fashion
no
shy
reserved
taciturn
recluse
this
her
eyes
were
shining
and
her
whole
face
was
full
of
a
bright
expression
such
as
the
others
had
never
seen
there
before
hallo
gerda
what
are
you
doing
here
called
deirdre
finding
speech
at
last
gerda
dropped
ronnie
and
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
sharp
exclamation
no
one
could
have
looked
more
utterly
and
egregiously
caught
she
stood
staring
at
the
two
faces
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
offered
no
explanation
whatever
ronnie
however
waved
his
hand
merrily
we
been
playing
zoo
he
volunteered
gerda
been
a
lion
and
gobbled
me
up
and
she
been
an
elephant
and
given
me
rides
and
we
were
both
polar
bears
and
growled
at
each
other
listen
how
i
can
growl
now
oh
and
look
what
she
given
me
for
my
birthday
it
comes
from
germany
producing
from
his
pocket
a
little
compass
now
if
ever
i
get
lost
i
can
always
find
my
way
home
see
i
can
show
you
which
is
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
you
better
be
going
back
gerda
remarked
dulcie
grimly
you
know
we
not
allowed
in
the
castle
grounds
without
a
special
invitation
i
come
through
the
side
gate
replied
gerda
turning
from
ronnie
without
even
a
deirdre
and
dulcie
dropped
from
the
wall
and
met
their
at
the
identical
moment
when
she
passed
through
the
turnstile
well
of
all
mean
people
you
the
meanest
observed
deirdre
i
call
it
sneaky
to
take
such
an
advantage
and
go
to
play
with
ronnie
by
yourself
we
do
it
if
it
were
allowed
but
it
is
i
wonder
his
governess
was
with
him
said
dulcie
he
generally
so
very
much
looked
after
and
as
for
going
inside
the
castle
garden
it
was
most
fearful
cheek
continued
deirdre
we
who
know
trevellyan
quite
well
never
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
what
i
call
meanest
put
in
dulcie
was
to
try
and
curry
favour
with
ronnie
by
giving
him
a
birthday
present
on
your
own
account
miss
birks
said
there
were
to
be
no
separate
presents
we
were
all
to
join
so
that
there
be
no
jealousy
and
you
would
subscribe
oh
you
are
a
nasty
underhand
sneak
have
you
anything
to
say
for
yourself
but
gerda
stumped
resolutely
along
with
her
hands
in
her
coat
pockets
and
answered
never
a
word
chapter
viii
a
meeting
on
the
shore
know
dulcie
remarked
deirdre
when
the
chums
were
alone
the
more
i
think
about
it
the
more
convinced
i
am
there
something
queer
about
gerda
thorwaldson
so
am
i
returned
dulcie
emphatically
something
very
queer
indeed
i
never
liked
her
from
the
first
she
always
gives
me
the
impression
that
she
listening
and
taking
mental
notes
for
what
ah
that
the
question
what
i
certainly
think
we
ought
to
be
on
our
guard
and
to
watch
her
carefully
only
we
must
on
any
account
let
her
know
what
doing
rather
not
she
no
business
to
sneak
away
by
herself
when
we
all
salvaging
on
the
beach
she
knows
perfectly
well
it
against
rules
she
does
seem
to
mind
rules
well
look
here
we
must
keep
an
eye
on
her
and
next
time
we
see
her
decamping
we
just
follow
her
and
watch
where
she
goes
i
do
like
people
with
underhand
ways
it
does
suit
us
at
the
dower
house
agreed
dulcie
though
the
chums
kept
gerda
movements
under
strict
surveillance
for
several
days
they
could
discover
nothing
at
which
to
take
exception
she
did
not
attempt
to
absent
herself
or
in
any
way
break
rules
she
asked
no
questions
and
exhibited
no
curiosity
on
any
subject
if
possible
she
was
even
more
silent
and
than
before
rather
baffled
the
girls
nevertheless
did
not
relax
their
vigilance
she
foxing
we
must
wait
and
see
what
happens
do
on
any
account
let
her
humbug
us
said
deirdre
one
afternoon
a
strong
west
wind
blowing
straight
from
the
sea
seemed
to
promise
such
a
good
haul
at
their
engrossing
occupation
that
the
girls
who
for
a
day
or
two
had
forsaken
salvaging
in
favour
of
hockey
practice
turned
their
steps
one
and
all
towards
the
beach
as
they
walked
along
across
the
warren
they
had
a
tolerably
clear
and
uninterrupted
view
of
the
whole
of
the
little
peninsula
and
were
themselves
very
conspicuous
objects
to
anyone
who
chanced
to
be
walking
on
the
shore
deirdre
eyes
were
wandering
from
sea
to
sky
from
distant
rock
to
near
primrose
clumps
when
happening
to
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
cliff
that
overtopped
perran
well
she
was
perfectly
sure
that
she
saw
a
white
handkerchief
waved
in
the
breeze
it
was
gone
in
an
instant
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
human
figure
to
account
for
the
circumstance
but
deirdre
was
certain
it
was
no
illusion
she
called
dulcie
attention
to
it
but
dulcie
had
been
looking
the
other
way
and
had
seen
nothing
probably
it
was
only
a
piece
of
paper
blowing
down
the
cliff
she
objected
how
could
it
be
anyone
waving
nobody
allowed
on
the
warren
it
might
be
ronnie
and
miss
herbert
oh
no
we
could
see
them
quite
plainly
if
it
were
gerda
did
you
notice
something
white
i
do
see
anything
there
replied
gerda
surveying
the
distance
with
her
usual
inscrutable
expression
i
think
you
must
have
been
mistaken
it
seemed
quite
a
small
and
trivial
matter
and
though
deirdre
for
the
mere
sake
of
argument
stuck
to
her
point
all
the
way
down
to
the
beach
the
others
only
laughed
at
her
you
be
saying
it
a
ghost
next
declared
betty
i
think
blessed
with
a
very
powerful
imagination
deirdre
arrived
on
the
shore
the
girls
found
their
expectations
fully
justified
several
most
pieces
of
driftwood
were
bobbing
about
just
at
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
with
a
little
clever
management
could
probably
be
secured
and
would
make
a
valuable
addition
to
the
stack
which
was
to
furnish
their
beacon
fire
jessie
macpherson
who
possessed
a
pair
of
wading
boots
was
soon
in
command
directing
the
others
how
to
act
so
that
none
of
the
flotsam
should
be
lost
and
marshalling
her
band
of
eager
volunteers
with
the
skill
of
a
coastguardsman
wait
for
the
next
big
wave
have
your
hockey
sticks
ready
doris
and
francie
and
i
will
wade
in
and
try
to
catch
it
then
when
the
going
back
you
must
all
make
a
rush
and
try
to
hold
it
not
this
wave
wait
for
that
huge
one
that
coming
are
you
ready
now
now
the
owners
of
the
wading
boots
did
their
duty
nobly
they
caught
at
the
floating
piece
of
timber
and
held
on
to
it
grimly
while
a
line
of
girls
followed
the
retreating
wave
and
making
a
dash
seized
the
trophy
and
rolled
it
into
safety
oh
it
a
gorgeous
big
one
the
largest
we
have
that
was
neatly
done
we
robbed
old
father
neptune
this
time
it
a
piece
of
luck
of
flotsam
you
mean
three
cheers
for
the
beacon
hip
hip
hip
hooray
hooray
hooray
echoed
dulcie
then
she
looked
round
and
suddenly
touched
deirdre
on
the
arm
in
the
midst
of
the
general
excitement
gerda
had
vanished
where
had
she
gone
that
was
the
question
which
the
chums
at
once
asked
each
other
it
was
impossible
that
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
she
could
have
scaled
the
steep
path
from
the
cove
on
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
she
must
surely
have
run
along
the
shore
instead
to
the
east
the
great
mass
of
crags
formed
an
impassable
barrier
but
it
was
just
practicable
to
round
the
headland
to
the
west
without
a
moment
delay
they
dashed
off
in
that
direction
they
tore
in
hot
haste
over
the
wet
sand
scrambled
anyhow
amongst
the
rocks
at
the
point
regardless
of
injury
to
clothing
and
valiantly
leaping
a
narrow
channel
turned
the
corner
and
found
themselves
in
a
second
cove
similar
to
the
former
but
larger
and
more
inaccessible
from
the
cliffs
they
were
rewarded
for
their
promptitude
as
the
first
sight
that
caught
their
eyes
was
gerda
speeding
along
several
hundred
yards
in
front
of
them
as
if
she
had
some
definite
object
in
view
shall
i
shout
after
her
gasped
dulcie
not
for
the
world
returned
deirdre
we
must
let
her
know
being
followed
if
she
looks
back
she
see
us
we
hide
behind
this
rock
she
be
round
the
next
corner
in
a
minute
so
she
will
then
look
here
we
must
wait
till
she
gone
and
then
climb
up
the
cliff
and
run
along
and
peep
over
from
the
top
whew
it
be
a
climb
never
mind
we
manage
it
let
us
take
off
our
coats
and
carry
them
i
so
hot
deirdre
precautions
proved
to
be
most
necessary
gerda
turned
at
the
far
headland
and
took
a
survey
of
the
bay
before
she
scrambled
round
the
point
she
did
not
see
the
two
heads
peeping
at
her
from
behind
the
big
rock
and
apparently
was
satisfied
that
she
had
eluded
pursuit
no
sooner
had
she
disappeared
than
deirdre
and
dulcie
hurried
forth
and
choosing
what
looked
like
a
sheep
track
as
the
best
substitute
for
a
path
began
their
steep
and
toilsome
climb
excitement
and
determination
spurred
them
on
and
they
persevered
in
spite
of
grazed
knees
and
scratched
fingers
over
jagged
pieces
of
rock
between
brambles
that
seemed
set
with
more
than
their
due
share
of
thorns
catching
on
to
tufts
of
grass
or
projecting
roots
for
support
up
they
scrambled
somehow
till
they
gained
the
level
of
the
warren
above
the
course
that
followed
was
a
neat
little
bit
of
scouting
making
a
for
the
next
cove
they
then
dropped
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
crawling
under
cover
of
the
gorse
bushes
to
the
verge
of
the
cliff
peeped
cautiously
over
gerda
was
just
below
them
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
looking
out
to
sea
this
creek
was
a
much
smaller
and
narrower
one
than
the
others
and
the
rocks
were
too
precipitous
to
offer
foothold
even
to
the
most
venturesome
climber
well
concealed
beneath
a
thick
bush
that
overhung
the
brow
of
the
crag
deirdre
and
dulcie
had
an
excellent
view
of
their
schoolmate
movements
without
fear
of
betraying
their
presence
gerda
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
gazing
at
the
water
then
she
gave
a
long
and
peculiar
whistle
not
unlike
the
cry
of
the
curlew
it
was
at
once
answered
by
a
similar
one
from
a
distance
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
a
small
white
dinghy
shot
round
the
point
from
the
west
it
was
rowed
by
a
big
man
who
wore
a
brown
knitted
jersey
and
no
hat
with
powerful
strokes
he
pulled
himself
along
till
reaching
the
shallows
he
shipped
his
oars
jumped
overboard
and
ran
his
little
craft
upon
the
beach
he
had
scarcely
stepped
out
of
the
water
before
gerda
was
at
his
side
and
the
two
walked
together
along
the
beach
he
apparently
asking
eager
questions
to
which
she
gave
swift
replies
up
and
down
up
and
down
for
fully
ten
minutes
they
paced
too
absorbed
in
their
conversation
to
look
up
at
the
cliff
above
though
had
they
done
so
they
would
scarcely
have
spied
the
two
spectators
who
cowered
close
under
the
shelter
of
the
overhanging
hazel
bush
squeezing
each
hands
in
the
excitement
of
the
scene
they
were
witnessing
the
man
appeared
to
have
many
directions
to
give
for
he
talked
long
and
earnestly
and
gerda
nodded
her
head
frequently
as
if
to
show
her
thorough
comprehension
of
what
he
was
saying
at
last
she
glanced
at
her
watch
and
they
both
hurried
back
to
where
they
had
left
the
boat
he
launched
his
little
dinghy
sprang
in
seized
the
oars
and
rowed
away
as
rapidly
as
he
had
arrived
gerda
stood
on
the
beach
looking
after
him
till
he
had
rounded
the
point
and
disappeared
from
her
view
then
crying
bitterly
she
began
to
walk
back
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
deirdre
and
dulcie
waited
until
she
was
safely
past
the
corner
and
out
of
sight
then
they
sprang
up
and
stretched
their
cramped
limbs
for
the
discomfort
of
their
position
had
grown
wellnigh
intolerable
ugh
i
do
believe
i
could
have
kept
still
one
second
longer
exploded
dulcie
my
feet
are
full
of
pins
and
needles
said
deirdre
stamping
her
hardest
and
my
elbow
is
so
sore
where
i
have
been
leaning
on
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
hurts
it
ca
be
worse
than
mine
i
say
though
we
seen
something
queer
rather
who
can
that
man
be
that
just
what
i
want
to
know
it
looks
very
suspicious
suspicious
is
the
name
for
it
do
you
think
we
ought
to
tell
miss
birks
no
no
no
that
would
never
do
we
must
say
nothing
at
all
but
go
on
keeping
our
eyes
open
and
see
if
we
can
find
out
anything
more
let
gerda
get
the
least
hint
that
we
on
her
track
suppose
jessie
asks
us
why
we
left
the
cove
what
are
we
to
say
why
that
we
missed
gerda
and
as
she
our
we
went
over
the
warren
to
see
if
we
could
find
her
and
make
a
threesome
it
was
our
plain
duty
dulcie
chuckled
oh
our
duty
of
course
and
naturally
of
course
we
did
find
her
on
the
warren
she
was
there
she
have
to
make
her
own
explanations
if
jessie
asks
her
where
she
was
trust
her
for
that
i
wonder
what
excuse
she
give
illustration
the
man
appeared
to
have
many
directions
to
give
as
it
happened
everything
turned
out
most
simply
deirdre
and
dulcie
overtook
gerda
farther
on
along
the
warren
and
concluded
that
she
had
probably
climbed
up
from
the
second
cove
by
the
same
path
as
themselves
they
discreetly
ignored
her
red
eyes
and
made
some
casual
remarks
upon
the
weather
the
three
were
walking
together
when
the
rest
of
the
school
came
up
from
salvaging
the
head
girl
looked
at
them
but
seeing
that
they
formed
an
orthodox
threesome
made
no
comment
and
passed
on
she
probably
thought
they
had
been
taking
a
stroll
on
the
warren
gerda
looked
almost
gratefully
at
her
companions
she
had
evidently
felt
afraid
lest
they
should
mention
the
fact
that
she
had
not
been
with
them
the
whole
time
she
made
quite
an
effort
to
speak
on
indifferent
subjects
as
they
walked
back
and
was
more
conversational
than
they
ever
remembered
her
at
however
she
relapsed
into
silence
and
during
the
evening
nobody
could
draw
a
word
from
her
dulcie
woke
once
during
the
night
and
heard
her
crying
quietly
the
two
chums
puzzled
their
heads
continually
over
the
meaning
of
the
strange
scene
they
had
witnessed
many
were
the
theories
they
advanced
and
cast
aside
one
only
appeared
to
deirdre
to
be
a
really
possible
explanation
i
tell
you
what
i
believe
she
said
i
think
that
man
in
the
brown
jersey
is
a
german
spy
you
know
although
gerda
sticks
to
it
that
she
is
english
we
always
had
our
doubts
she
looks
german
and
she
speaks
better
german
than
mademoiselle
though
mademoiselle
swiss
and
has
talked
two
languages
from
babyhood
gerda
is
an
english
name
she
says
it
was
taken
from
gerda
in
snow
queen
but
can
one
believe
her
i
called
because
my
family
irish
and
it
an
old
celtic
name
but
is
distinctly
teutonic
then
she
spells
thorwaldson
but
in
one
of
her
books
i
found
it
written
thorwaldsen
which
is
most
suggestive
no
mark
my
words
she
a
german
and
she
come
here
as
a
spy
what
has
she
to
spy
on
asked
dulcie
deeply
impressed
why
do
you
see
a
knowledge
of
this
part
of
the
coast
would
be
simply
invaluable
to
the
germans
if
they
wanted
to
invade
us
all
these
narrow
creeks
and
coves
would
be
places
to
bring
vessels
to
and
land
troops
and
the
castle
could
be
taken
and
held
as
a
fort
and
perhaps
the
dower
house
too
is
that
why
she
was
measuring
the
passage
it
might
very
easily
be
she
give
them
a
plan
of
the
school
oh
would
they
come
and
turn
us
out
and
kill
us
one
never
knows
what
an
enemy
might
do
this
bit
of
shore
is
not
at
all
well
protected
we
a
long
way
from
a
coastguard
station
on
either
side
it
just
the
sort
of
spot
where
a
whole
army
could
be
quietly
landed
in
a
few
hours
before
anyone
had
an
inkling
of
what
was
going
on
there
no
doubt
that
we
ought
to
watch
gerda
most
carefully
it
may
mean
saving
our
country
from
a
terrible
catastrophe
chapter
ix
a
message
now
that
they
had
decided
on
an
explanation
of
their
mysterious
conduct
the
chums
felt
that
every
circumstance
seemed
to
point
in
its
favour
they
wondered
they
had
never
thought
of
it
before
the
importance
of
keeping
a
strict
watch
was
realized
by
both
there
was
a
certain
satisfaction
in
doing
so
they
felt
as
if
they
were
rendering
their
country
a
service
almost
indeed
as
if
they
were
members
of
a
secret
diplomatic
corps
and
had
been
told
off
for
special
duty
who
knew
what
england
might
have
to
thank
them
for
some
day
possibly
at
no
very
date
the
whole
country
might
be
ringing
with
their
names
and
the
newspapers
publishing
portraits
of
the
two
schoolgirls
who
had
averted
a
national
disaster
just
to
be
prepared
for
emergencies
they
took
snapshots
of
each
other
with
dulcie
brownie
camera
and
added
a
series
of
photographs
of
the
school
all
of
which
they
thought
would
be
very
suitable
to
give
to
the
enthusiastic
reporter
who
would
demand
an
illustrated
interview
they
were
rather
disappointed
with
the
results
of
the
portraits
which
in
their
estimation
scarcely
did
them
justice
i
look
more
like
forty
than
fourteen
said
deirdre
regarding
ruefully
the
dark
shadows
on
her
cheeks
and
the
lines
under
her
eyes
it
show
my
hair
properly
either
no
one
could
tell
it
was
curly
and
i
look
as
fat
as
a
prize
pig
with
no
eyes
to
speak
of
and
an
imbecile
grin
i
wonder
how
real
photographers
manage
to
touch
things
up
and
make
them
look
so
nice
in
spite
of
their
best
efforts
it
had
proved
impossible
to
do
their
developing
and
printing
without
their
handiwork
being
seen
by
their
companions
the
photographs
of
the
school
were
so
good
that
the
girls
begged
them
shamelessly
to
send
home
gerda
was
particularly
importunate
and
even
offered
to
buy
copies
when
they
were
refused
as
a
gift
we
do
sell
our
things
said
dulcie
bluntly
you
may
go
on
asking
till
doomsday
and
you
wo
get
a
single
print
so
there
to
the
chums
gerda
request
was
full
of
significance
it
shows
pretty
plainly
we
on
the
right
track
said
deirdre
of
course
she
wants
them
to
send
to
her
foreign
government
they
pay
her
handsomely
do
she
wish
she
may
get
them
snorted
dulcie
the
affair
made
an
added
coolness
in
their
dormitory
gerda
appeared
to
think
them
unkind
while
they
stood
more
than
ever
on
the
alert
they
watched
her
unceasingly
for
some
days
however
they
could
find
nothing
of
an
incriminating
nature
in
her
conduct
possibly
she
was
aware
of
their
vigilance
and
was
on
her
guard
against
them
i
believe
we
overdoing
it
said
deirdre
anxiously
best
slack
off
a
little
and
seem
as
if
we
taking
no
notice
of
her
do
follow
her
about
so
continually
it
getting
too
marked
altogether
we
must
be
diplomatic
just
at
present
gerda
behaviour
was
perfectly
orthodox
if
she
went
on
the
warren
it
was
invariably
as
one
of
a
threesome
and
the
chums
could
detect
her
in
no
more
solitary
and
clandestine
excursions
she
seemed
to
have
assumed
a
sudden
interest
in
salvaging
and
particularly
in
the
beacon
which
the
girls
were
beginning
to
build
upon
the
headland
no
one
was
ready
to
work
harder
in
carrying
up
the
pieces
of
driftwood
from
the
beach
and
piling
them
on
to
the
great
stack
which
every
day
grew
a
little
higher
and
higher
till
it
really
began
to
be
a
conspicuous
object
and
could
be
seen
from
both
the
villages
of
pontperran
and
porthmorvan
and
from
the
sea
it
was
at
suggestion
that
a
union
jack
fastened
to
a
pole
was
kept
flying
from
the
top
a
little
piece
of
patriotism
which
appealed
to
the
school
at
large
though
it
roused
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
the
chums
it
a
signal
of
course
said
dulcie
some
fine
day
she
pull
it
down
and
substitute
the
german
flag
agreed
deirdre
she
only
waiting
her
opportunity
unless
we
circumvent
her
there
are
two
britishers
here
who
mean
to
look
after
their
country
it
was
curious
how
many
little
things
really
quite
trivial
in
themselves
seemed
to
point
in
the
direction
of
the
chums
fears
miss
birks
greatly
encouraged
a
debating
society
among
her
girls
and
on
her
list
of
subjects
for
discussion
had
placed
that
of
national
truth
versus
diplomatic
evasions
gerda
had
certainly
been
chosen
to
speak
for
the
opposition
and
was
therefore
pledged
to
the
side
of
diplomacy
but
deirdre
and
dulcie
thought
she
made
far
too
good
a
case
of
it
and
pleaded
much
too
warmly
the
cause
of
the
ambassador
who
on
behalf
of
his
country
honour
is
obliged
to
meet
guile
with
guile
and
outwit
the
enemy
by
means
of
stratagems
and
schemes
any
expedient
is
allowable
for
the
sake
of
your
fatherland
she
had
contended
and
dulcie
quoted
the
words
with
a
grave
shake
of
her
head
as
she
talked
the
matter
over
with
deirdre
notice
particularly
that
she
said
fatherland
now
the
vaterland
is
always
germany
she
did
mean
britain
you
may
depend
upon
it
no
she
planning
and
scheming
for
another
war
then
we
plan
and
scheme
for
king
george
we
accept
her
principles
and
use
of
any
stratagem
to
outwit
the
enemy
so
they
waited
and
watched
and
watched
and
waited
in
what
they
flattered
themselves
was
true
machiavellian
style
till
they
were
almost
growing
tired
of
so
fruitless
an
occupation
then
one
day
quite
unexpectedly
something
happened
it
was
a
wild
windy
march
morning
and
the
girls
were
taking
a
hasty
run
on
the
warren
between
morning
school
and
dinner
to
blow
away
cobwebs
and
give
them
an
appetite
there
was
not
time
to
go
far
but
they
dispersed
in
all
directions
trying
which
could
make
the
biggest
distance
record
available
gerda
had
started
with
annie
pridwell
and
betty
scott
but
under
pretence
of
beating
their
speed
she
had
got
considerably
ahead
and
left
them
panting
in
the
rear
where
gerda
asked
deirdre
who
with
dulcie
and
evie
bennett
had
followed
the
first
threesome
we
simply
ca
keep
up
with
her
she
walked
as
if
she
had
boots
she
gone
over
the
hill
there
i
going
to
wait
till
she
comes
back
there
no
sense
in
flying
like
the
wandering
jew
protested
betty
i
hope
she
wo
be
long
because
i
do
want
to
walk
back
as
fast
as
i
came
dulcie
and
i
go
after
her
said
deirdre
promptly
we
do
mind
running
you
two
can
be
toddling
along
with
evie
as
leisurely
as
you
like
it
only
meant
a
change
of
threesomes
so
the
girls
agreed
readily
and
departed
at
once
leaving
the
chums
to
act
escort
to
the
truant
she
done
it
on
purpose
gasped
dulcie
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
of
course
it
a
perfectly
transparent
dodge
now
we
must
do
secret
service
work
again
and
not
let
her
see
she
being
followed
the
chums
really
congratulated
themselves
that
they
were
getting
on
in
the
matter
of
scouting
they
availed
themselves
so
cleverly
of
the
cover
of
rocks
and
bushes
and
proceeded
with
such
admirable
caution
and
care
their
efforts
were
successful
for
after
a
few
minutes
of
skilful
stalking
they
caught
sight
of
their
quarry
gerda
was
climbing
down
the
cliff
side
fully
a
hundred
feet
below
them
and
had
nearly
reached
the
level
of
the
beach
she
descended
quickly
almost
recklessly
scrambling
anyhow
over
rocks
and
through
brambles
and
splashing
through
a
boggy
piece
where
a
trickle
of
water
had
formed
a
pool
arrived
on
the
shingle
she
went
straight
to
a
hole
among
the
rocks
searched
in
the
seaweed
and
produced
a
bottle
taking
a
piece
of
paper
from
her
pocket
she
folded
it
into
a
long
narrow
slip
and
put
it
inside
replacing
the
cork
tightly
then
she
ran
towards
the
crag
at
the
mouth
of
the
cove
and
climbing
up
higher
than
was
compatible
with
safety
she
hurled
the
bottle
as
far
as
she
could
throw
it
into
the
sea
she
stood
looking
for
a
moment
or
two
as
it
bobbed
about
on
the
surface
of
the
water
then
turning
round
began
to
scramble
back
with
more
haste
than
care
we
seen
enough
come
quick
before
she
spies
us
whispered
deirdre
dragging
dulcie
away
we
must
let
her
know
we
were
anywhere
near
let
us
run
and
be
a
long
way
off
before
she
gets
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
sees
us
the
clanging
of
the
first
dinner
bell
which
could
plainly
be
heard
in
the
distance
certainly
offered
a
reasonable
excuse
for
hurry
the
chums
fled
like
hares
and
even
with
their
best
efforts
only
took
their
places
at
table
when
grace
was
said
and
the
beef
carved
gerda
was
later
still
and
scurried
in
hot
and
breathless
after
the
potatoes
had
been
handed
she
drank
her
whole
glassful
of
water
at
a
gulp
deirdre
and
dulcie
avoided
looking
at
her
but
they
nudged
each
other
secretly
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
know
what
she
had
been
doing
though
they
could
not
openly
proclaim
their
rejoicing
the
penalty
for
lateness
at
meals
was
a
fine
but
they
put
their
pennies
in
the
charity
box
with
the
feeling
of
philanthropists
they
considered
them
as
contributions
to
a
most
excellent
cause
it
was
wednesday
and
a
at
three
the
whole
school
was
to
start
for
a
walk
to
avonporth
and
in
the
meantime
the
girls
were
expected
to
busy
themselves
with
minor
occupations
a
certain
number
were
due
at
the
pianos
for
practising
or
music
lessons
and
from
the
rest
mending
and
the
tidying
of
drawers
would
be
required
gerda
marched
off
with
a
volume
of
beethoven
and
was
soon
hard
at
work
on
the
moonlight
sonata
under
mademoiselle
tuition
she
played
well
for
she
had
been
carefully
taught
in
germany
and
had
a
good
execution
and
sympathetic
touch
deirdre
and
dulcie
stood
outside
the
door
for
a
moment
or
two
listening
to
her
crisp
chords
she
boxed
up
there
safe
for
an
hour
commented
deirdre
yes
mademoiselle
wo
let
her
off
agreed
dulcie
i
could
do
my
darning
after
tea
and
my
drawers
are
as
tidy
as
tidy
so
are
mine
should
we
do
you
think
we
dare
yes
yes
i
game
if
you
are
then
the
pair
did
a
scandalous
deed
such
as
they
had
never
even
contemplated
in
all
their
schooldays
before
they
took
french
leave
and
went
out
on
to
the
warren
they
knew
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
if
they
were
caught
for
they
were
breaking
three
rules
all
at
once
absenting
themselves
without
permission
going
two
together
instead
of
in
a
threesome
and
being
on
the
headland
at
a
forbidden
hour
perhaps
the
very
riskiness
of
the
undertaking
added
to
its
enjoyment
we
must
try
and
get
that
bottle
and
here
our
opportunity
said
deirdre
we
ca
explain
to
miss
birks
now
but
we
can
tell
her
some
day
that
we
went
out
of
sheer
necessity
argued
dulcie
of
course
it
only
our
duty
even
the
best
of
rules
have
to
be
broken
sometimes
when
it
a
matter
of
expediency
miss
birks
will
quite
appreciate
that
yes
when
she
knows
the
whole
meantime
miss
birks
did
not
know
and
the
sense
that
their
disinterested
motives
might
be
liable
to
misinterpretation
caused
the
chums
to
proceed
warily
and
avoid
exposing
themselves
to
any
observer
from
the
upper
windows
they
tacked
along
bypaths
and
went
rather
a
roundabout
route
to
reach
their
destination
their
hope
was
that
the
rising
water
might
have
washed
the
bottle
back
on
to
the
beach
for
gerda
arm
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
throw
it
sufficiently
far
to
carry
it
into
the
open
sea
and
when
they
last
saw
it
it
had
been
whirling
round
and
round
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
they
climbed
down
the
cliff
side
by
the
same
track
that
she
had
followed
and
ran
eagerly
to
the
edge
of
the
waves
the
tide
was
much
higher
than
it
had
been
before
dinner
and
was
rolling
up
its
usual
toll
of
sticks
seaweed
and
miscellaneous
debris
what
was
that
object
that
kept
appearing
and
disappearing
by
a
mass
of
floating
brown
bladderwrack
one
moment
it
had
vanished
and
the
next
it
bobbed
up
persistently
deirdre
and
dulcie
did
not
wait
to
ask
with
one
accord
they
whisked
off
shoes
and
stockings
a
proceeding
utterly
and
entirely
forbidden
except
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
and
plunged
into
the
water
they
were
both
adepts
in
the
art
of
salvaging
but
no
piece
of
driftwood
ever
gave
them
more
trouble
than
that
elusive
bottle
which
dipped
and
dived
and
evaded
them
with
the
skill
of
an
eel
the
beach
was
shingly
not
sandy
which
made
their
fishing
not
only
a
slippery
but
a
most
agonizing
performance
they
were
obliged
to
grip
each
other
hands
to
keep
their
foothold
at
all
at
last
a
larger
wave
than
usual
proved
helpful
and
indeed
did
its
office
so
thoroughly
that
it
dashed
the
bottle
against
dulcie
shins
with
a
squeal
of
pain
she
caught
it
nearly
upsetting
herself
and
deirdre
in
the
process
and
the
pair
hobbled
back
to
where
they
had
left
their
shoes
and
stockings
ugh
i
absolutely
lame
i
did
know
stones
could
cut
so
complained
deirdre
look
at
my
leg
it
will
be
black
and
blue
i
know
groaned
dulcie
the
possession
of
the
bottle
however
was
ample
compensation
for
any
scars
they
might
have
won
in
the
struggle
for
its
acquisition
they
tried
with
impatient
fingers
to
pull
out
the
cork
but
as
that
proved
obdurate
they
cut
the
gordian
knot
by
breaking
the
neck
on
a
stone
the
thin
piece
of
foreign
was
quite
untouched
by
wet
together
they
unfolded
it
knocking
their
heads
in
their
eagerness
to
read
it
both
at
once
at
last
surely
they
were
within
reach
of
gerda
secret
but
the
letter
was
written
in
german
and
alas
the
chums
were
still
in
the
elementary
stages
of
the
language
so
that
except
for
a
chance
word
here
and
there
they
could
not
decipher
a
line
of
it
their
disappointment
was
keen
what
does
she
mean
by
writing
in
her
wretched
old
deutsch
demanded
dulcie
indignantly
oh
bother
her
i
wish
i
could
read
it
moaned
deirdre
never
had
the
advantages
of
education
appealed
to
the
girls
more
strongly
they
began
to
think
quite
seriously
of
the
necessity
for
studying
foreign
languages
why
did
i
have
a
fräulein
in
my
babyhood
instead
of
an
ordinary
english
nursery
governess
lamented
deirdre
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
with
a
dictionary
said
dulcie
more
hopefully
the
idea
was
consoling
enough
to
prompt
them
to
put
on
their
shoes
and
stockings
pocket
the
document
and
climb
the
cliff
after
all
if
they
could
make
little
out
of
it
themselves
they
had
at
least
prevented
the
message
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
person
for
whom
it
was
destined
and
so
had
frustrated
gerda
intention
that
was
sufficient
reward
for
their
trouble
even
without
the
chance
of
learning
its
contents
we
can
keep
asking
separate
words
or
even
sentences
until
we
can
piece
it
all
together
said
dulcie
sagely
right
you
are
and
now
we
best
rush
back
as
fast
as
we
can
time
waits
for
nobody
and
during
their
excursion
to
the
beach
it
had
seemed
to
roll
on
above
the
speed
limit
unless
they
meant
to
be
late
for
the
walk
they
must
hurry
they
were
obliged
to
skirt
the
cliffs
for
they
did
not
dare
to
show
themselves
on
the
open
tract
of
the
warren
it
was
not
particularly
easy
to
make
haste
along
a
narrow
path
beset
with
briers
and
riddled
with
rabbit
holes
deirdre
went
first
because
she
always
naturally
took
the
lead
and
dulcie
whose
physical
endurance
was
less
panted
after
her
a
bad
second
suddenly
deirdre
stopped
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
looked
intently
over
the
sea
at
a
small
object
in
the
far
distance
what
that
she
asked
sharply
for
a
moment
or
two
it
had
the
semblance
of
a
huge
bird
then
a
strange
whirring
noise
was
heard
and
as
it
drew
rapidly
nearer
and
nearer
they
could
see
it
was
an
aeroplane
flying
at
no
great
height
over
the
water
apparently
it
was
aiming
for
the
exact
spot
where
they
were
standing
and
quite
scared
the
girls
crouched
down
beside
a
gorse
bush
with
a
loud
whirr
it
passed
over
their
heads
and
steering
as
easily
as
a
hawk
alighted
gently
on
the
moorland
only
about
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
here
was
a
pretty
state
of
things
had
the
vanguard
of
the
german
army
arrived
already
and
did
the
enemy
mean
to
swoop
down
on
the
school
they
peeped
timorously
from
behind
the
bush
and
saw
two
airmen
in
full
oilskins
dismount
hastily
and
make
an
examination
of
the
machine
whether
they
were
germans
it
was
impossible
to
tell
they
spoke
in
tones
too
low
for
their
words
to
carry
and
certainly
their
garments
gave
no
hint
of
their
nationality
they
looked
round
searchingly
as
if
verifying
their
whereabouts
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
girls
who
cowered
under
their
gorse
bush
devoutly
hoping
they
were
not
visible
and
consulted
a
map
then
after
an
earnest
conference
entered
their
machine
again
and
started
off
in
a
northerly
direction
flying
over
the
warren
towards
avonporth
the
chums
almost
spellbound
watched
the
aeroplane
till
it
waned
into
a
mere
speck
in
the
sky
then
fear
lent
them
wings
and
they
scuttled
back
to
school
at
a
pace
they
had
never
attained
even
at
the
annual
sports
fortune
favoured
them
and
they
managed
to
dodge
unnoticed
into
the
garden
run
round
to
the
front
and
just
in
the
nick
of
time
take
their
places
among
the
file
of
girls
assembled
on
the
drive
nobody
mentioned
the
aeroplane
so
evidently
nobody
but
themselves
could
have
seen
it
whence
it
came
and
where
it
was
going
remained
a
mystery
though
deirdre
and
dulcie
had
a
settled
conviction
that
gerda
could
have
enlightened
them
on
that
point
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
trick
they
had
played
her
and
as
they
walked
just
behind
her
they
chuckled
inwardly
at
the
knowledge
that
her
cherished
letter
lay
in
pocket
outward
and
visible
triumph
they
dared
not
venture
on
it
was
too
dangerous
an
indulgence
for
those
who
wished
to
keep
a
secret
as
it
was
they
found
it
difficult
to
evade
the
enquiries
of
their
friends
what
became
of
you
two
just
now
asked
evie
bennett
miss
harding
was
inspecting
drawers
and
she
sent
me
to
fetch
you
i
such
a
hunt
all
over
the
place
and
could
find
you
anywhere
you
a
notoriously
bad
looker
you
know
evie
returned
deirdre
laughing
the
matter
off
so
miss
harding
said
but
it
is
fair
to
expect
one
to
find
people
who
are
there
perhaps
betty
had
mesmerized
us
into
the
hypnotic
state
and
rendered
us
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
such
as
yours
now
do
rag
me
oh
was
that
joke
spiffing
i
shall
never
forget
va
with
their
faces
all
streaked
with
black
i
laughed
till
i
nearly
died
they
have
forgiven
us
and
i
believe
they
plotting
something
to
pay
us
back
in
our
own
coin
let
them
try
if
they
like
we
not
easily
taken
in
by
the
by
i
was
hunting
for
you
two
just
now
annie
pridwell
broke
in
i
wanted
to
borrow
some
darning
wool
and
as
i
could
find
you
i
helped
myself
off
your
i
do
know
whose
basket
it
was
i
rifled
i
took
the
last
skein
mine
but
you
welcome
said
dulcie
my
stockings
are
darned
for
this
week
and
shown
to
miss
harding
and
put
away
i
get
some
more
wool
on
saturday
if
we
go
to
the
village
but
i
could
find
you
when
i
looked
for
you
persisted
annie
yes
where
were
you
asked
evie
again
but
to
such
an
inconvenient
question
the
chums
prudently
turned
deaf
ears
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
determined
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
until
they
had
obtained
a
translation
of
the
letter
which
they
had
purloined
from
the
bottle
they
did
not
care
to
show
the
manuscript
itself
to
any
of
the
elder
girls
as
to
do
so
might
be
to
betray
their
secret
but
by
dint
of
asking
odd
sentences
and
words
they
made
it
out
to
run
thus
very
little
to
report
no
progress
at
all
just
at
present
extreme
caution
necessary
better
keep
clear
of
headland
for
a
while
and
let
all
plans
stand
over
there
was
neither
beginning
nor
signature
and
no
date
or
address
to
the
chums
the
communication
had
only
one
meaning
it
must
refer
to
a
german
attack
upon
the
coast
the
aeroplane
had
probably
been
prospecting
for
a
suitable
place
to
land
troops
it
was
gerda
who
was
to
supply
the
information
needed
by
the
foreign
government
as
to
a
favourable
time
for
executing
a
evidently
she
did
not
consider
the
hour
was
yet
ripe
for
the
present
england
was
safe
but
who
knew
for
how
long
it
that
man
in
the
brown
jersey
who
engineering
the
mischief
said
deirdre
when
we
see
him
sneaking
about
in
his
boat
we
may
know
something
on
foot
what
ought
we
to
do
asked
dulcie
doubtfully
nothing
can
be
done
just
now
if
they
on
their
guard
and
lying
low
we
must
be
vigilant
and
keep
a
general
eye
over
things
if
anything
unexpected
crops
up
we
can
warn
the
police
but
of
course
we
should
have
to
have
very
good
grounds
to
go
upon
in
that
case
a
perfectly
circumstantial
story
to
tell
we
nothing
but
suspicions
at
present
that
the
worst
of
it
we
want
more
direct
evidence
they
might
only
laugh
at
us
for
our
pains
and
we
should
get
into
trouble
with
miss
birks
for
interfering
in
concerns
that
are
ours
no
we
keep
the
police
as
the
very
last
resource
and
only
tell
them
what
we
know
in
the
face
of
a
great
emergency
chapter
x
marooned
miss
birks
birthday
fell
on
the
april
and
so
did
betty
scott
it
was
not
a
particularly
happy
date
for
an
anniversary
but
they
both
declared
they
liked
it
to
betty
it
was
certainly
a
chequered
event
for
the
girls
treated
her
to
the
jokes
they
dared
not
play
on
the
and
she
had
to
endure
a
double
dose
of
chaffing
but
on
the
other
hand
a
birthday
shared
with
miss
birks
was
luck
above
the
common
there
was
invariably
a
whole
holiday
and
some
special
treat
to
celebrate
the
occasion
the
nature
of
the
festival
depended
so
entirely
upon
the
day
that
it
was
not
generally
decided
till
the
last
minute
which
added
an
element
of
surprise
and
on
the
whole
enhanced
the
enjoyment
whether
this
year
jollification
would
be
outdoors
or
indoors
was
naturally
a
subject
of
much
speculation
but
the
morning
itself
settled
the
question
such
a
clear
blue
sky
such
brilliant
sunshine
and
so
calm
a
sea
pointed
emphatically
to
an
excursion
by
water
and
miss
birks
at
once
decided
to
hire
boats
and
take
the
school
for
a
picnic
to
a
little
group
of
islets
due
west
of
the
headland
the
girls
loved
being
on
the
sea
and
did
not
often
get
an
opportunity
of
gratifying
their
nautical
tendencies
for
they
were
of
course
never
allowed
to
hire
boats
on
their
own
account
miss
birks
was
too
afraid
of
accidents
to
permit
lessons
in
rowing
though
many
of
her
pupils
thirsted
to
try
their
skill
with
the
oars
and
had
often
vainly
begged
leave
to
learn
in
the
harbour
three
small
yachts
with
steady
and
experienced
boatmen
were
waiting
by
the
quay
at
pontperran
and
even
mademoiselle
the
champion
of
timorous
fears
stepped
inside
without
any
nervous
dread
of
going
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
it
was
delightful
skimming
out
over
the
dancing
shining
water
so
smooth
that
the
worst
sailor
could
not
experience
a
qualm
yet
lapping
gently
against
the
bows
as
if
it
were
trying
to
leap
up
and
investigate
the
cargo
of
fair
maidens
carried
on
its
bosom
with
one
accord
the
girls
struck
up
some
boat
songs
and
the
strains
of
row
brothers
row
or
speed
bonny
boat
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
over
the
sea
to
skye
rang
clear
and
sweet
in
the
fresh
spring
air
everybody
agreed
that
the
passage
was
too
short
and
they
were
almost
sorry
when
they
arrived
at
their
destination
the
islands
were
nothing
more
than
a
group
of
five
rocks
too
small
for
cultivation
and
inhabited
only
by
some
rough
grass
and
bushes
grew
on
the
largest
where
there
was
also
a
shelving
sandy
strip
of
beach
that
formed
a
safe
here
all
disembarked
and
the
provision
hampers
were
carried
ashore
together
with
the
big
iron
trivet
and
cauldron
used
for
picnics
there
was
something
very
fascinating
in
thus
taking
possession
of
a
desert
island
if
only
for
a
few
hours
for
the
present
the
school
felt
themselves
a
band
of
girl
crusoes
and
set
to
work
at
once
in
pioneer
fashion
to
make
preparations
for
lunch
there
was
an
ample
supply
of
lying
above
mark
to
serve
as
fuel
under
their
trivet
so
while
some
got
the
fire
going
others
took
garden
spades
which
they
had
brought
with
them
and
dug
sand
seats
sufficient
to
accommodate
the
company
the
chairs
destined
for
the
mistresses
were
quite
superior
erections
provided
with
backs
and
that
of
miss
birks
was
adorned
with
shells
specially
collected
from
the
rocks
by
a
committee
of
decoration
told
off
for
the
purpose
in
shape
and
elaboration
of
ornament
it
resembled
a
throne
and
as
a
finishing
touch
the
motto
a
happy
birthday
was
placed
in
yellow
periwinkles
at
the
foot
by
the
time
these
extensive
preparations
were
finished
the
cauldron
was
boiling
for
the
fire
had
been
well
kept
up
and
replenished
with
wood
miss
harding
dropped
in
the
muslin
bag
containing
the
tea
jessie
macpherson
assumed
command
of
the
milk
can
and
a
willing
army
carried
cups
and
laid
out
provisions
the
boatmen
were
provided
each
with
a
steaming
pint
mug
of
tea
and
a
basket
of
comestibles
amongst
them
and
retired
to
one
of
the
yachts
with
grins
of
satisfaction
on
their
countenances
that
hospitality
having
been
settled
the
cauldron
which
combined
the
function
of
urn
as
well
flowed
busily
filling
cup
after
cup
till
the
whole
school
collected
on
the
sand
seats
to
do
justice
to
the
provisions
there
were
rival
birthday
cakes
miss
birks
a
erection
decorated
with
candied
violets
was
perhaps
the
larger
of
the
two
but
betty
sent
from
home
had
the
glory
of
fifteen
coloured
candles
yours
ought
to
have
had
candles
too
miss
birks
she
said
as
she
carefully
struck
a
match
i
afraid
they
be
too
thick
on
the
ground
laughed
miss
birks
i
used
to
have
them
when
i
was
a
child
but
i
barred
the
exhibition
of
my
years
after
i
was
i
once
knew
a
gentleman
who
had
a
huge
birthday
cake
with
seventy
candles
on
and
all
his
grandchildren
came
to
his
party
volunteered
hilda
marriott
that
must
have
been
a
truly
patriarchal
cake
and
something
to
remember
i
afraid
i
can
only
offer
you
candied
violets
betty
shall
we
each
cut
our
first
slice
at
the
same
moment
here
to
health
and
prosperity
and
good
luck
for
the
rest
of
the
year
it
was
the
first
real
picnic
since
last
autumn
so
added
to
the
double
birthday
it
seemed
a
more
than
ordinary
festivity
and
everybody
waxed
particularly
jolly
miss
birks
told
humorous
irish
stories
and
made
endless
jokes
even
miss
harding
usually
the
pink
of
propriety
was
guilty
of
an
intentional
pun
the
merry
meal
was
over
at
last
and
when
the
baskets
had
been
repacked
all
dispersed
to
wander
round
the
tiny
island
it
did
not
differ
particularly
from
the
mainland
but
the
girls
found
it
amusing
to
investigate
new
coves
and
ramble
about
on
the
grassy
expanse
at
the
top
of
the
cliffs
a
few
sought
out
miss
birks
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
explore
the
next
largest
islet
of
the
group
so
after
a
little
discussion
half
a
dozen
were
sent
off
under
charge
of
miss
harding
in
one
of
the
boats
as
there
only
remained
about
forty
minutes
before
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
back
it
was
arranged
that
this
boat
should
not
waste
time
by
returning
to
the
bigger
island
but
should
start
on
its
own
account
independently
of
the
other
two
as
soon
as
its
party
had
made
a
brief
survey
of
the
islet
deirdre
and
dulcie
who
were
venturesome
climbers
took
advantage
of
the
extra
liberty
allowed
them
on
this
special
day
to
escape
by
themselves
without
the
tiresome
addition
of
the
usual
third
and
scaled
the
very
highest
point
of
the
rocky
centre
here
they
found
they
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
whole
of
the
small
group
and
could
command
a
prospect
of
cove
and
inlet
quite
unattainable
from
the
shore
dulcie
had
brought
a
pair
of
and
with
their
aid
distant
objects
drew
near
and
what
seemed
mere
specks
to
the
ordinary
vision
proved
to
be
preening
their
wings
or
resting
upon
the
rocks
they
watched
with
great
interest
the
progress
of
the
boat
to
the
other
island
did
know
miss
birks
was
going
to
let
anyone
go
or
we
have
gone
ourselves
lamented
deirdre
who
in
her
can
you
see
perfectly
miss
harding
and
jessie
macpherson
phyllis
rowland
doris
patterson
rhoda
wilkins
irene
jordan
and
gerda
thorwaldson
david
essery
is
rowing
them
oh
i
wish
we
gone
repeated
deirdre
enviously
give
me
the
glasses
and
let
me
take
a
look
it
was
a
very
long
look
that
swept
all
round
the
islands
and
took
in
every
detail
of
cliff
and
rock
deirdre
repeated
it
twice
then
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
dulcie
you
see
that
big
black
cliff
over
there
rather
like
a
seal
count
three
points
farther
on
and
tell
me
if
you
do
think
there
a
boat
in
that
tiny
inlet
dulcie
seized
the
glasses
and
proceeded
to
verify
the
statement
it
is
oh
it
certainly
is
it
moving
out
now
from
behind
the
rock
somebody
in
it
rowing
deirdre
i
do
believe
not
him
shrieked
deirdre
ungrammatically
snatching
the
glasses
from
her
friend
oh
it
is
i
perfectly
persuaded
it
is
it
just
his
figure
and
he
rows
in
the
same
way
exactly
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
then
gerda
engineered
that
expedition
to
go
and
meet
him
it
as
plain
as
plain
their
excitement
was
intense
it
did
indeed
seem
an
important
discovery
and
an
added
link
in
their
chain
of
circumstances
should
they
stay
where
they
were
and
watch
the
meeting
through
the
or
would
it
be
possible
to
follow
the
matter
up
more
nearly
they
resolved
to
make
a
try
for
the
latter
climbing
down
as
rapidly
as
they
could
from
their
point
of
vantage
they
found
miss
birks
and
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
party
on
the
other
island
john
pengelly
would
row
us
over
and
we
catch
them
up
immediately
they
pleaded
oh
do
please
let
us
go
miss
birks
was
in
a
birthday
frame
of
mind
and
prepared
to
listen
to
any
request
there
would
be
quite
room
for
you
to
go
home
in
david
essery
boat
she
acquiesced
yes
you
may
go
if
you
wish
john
pengelly
can
take
you
at
once
tell
miss
harding
i
sent
you
and
you
to
return
with
her
party
the
boatman
was
and
apparently
did
not
mind
making
the
extra
journey
he
grinned
at
the
girls
as
he
pushed
off
ca
have
too
much
of
the
sea
missies
he
ventured
i
soon
pull
you
over
there
he
landed
them
carefully
on
the
second
island
then
rowed
back
to
the
first
to
join
his
fellow
boatman
and
smoke
a
pipe
till
it
was
time
to
start
deirdre
and
dulcie
knew
exactly
which
way
miss
harding
and
the
girls
had
gone
and
their
plain
duty
was
to
follow
them
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
report
themselves
as
additions
to
the
party
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
however
instead
they
took
exactly
the
opposite
direction
and
made
for
the
western
side
of
the
islet
where
they
had
seen
the
mysterious
boat
you
may
depend
upon
it
we
shall
find
gerda
there
said
deirdre
better
not
to
let
her
know
we
here
we
far
more
likely
to
catch
her
with
a
little
scrambling
they
reached
an
inlet
which
so
they
calculated
must
be
the
one
they
had
marked
through
the
they
could
see
no
boat
however
and
no
gerda
they
waited
for
a
while
then
rambled
farther
along
the
shore
but
finding
nothing
came
back
to
their
former
point
they
had
so
entirely
counted
upon
gerda
being
there
that
they
felt
decidedly
disappointed
perhaps
she
could
sneak
off
suggested
dulcie
miss
harding
very
tiresome
and
particular
sometimes
i
wonder
if
the
boat
waiting
about
for
her
said
deirdre
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
she
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
waves
and
reproduced
as
nearly
as
she
could
remember
it
the
long
peculiar
curlew
cry
which
gerda
had
given
as
a
signal
on
the
former
occasion
the
effect
was
instantaneous
there
was
an
answering
whistle
and
from
behind
a
rock
not
very
far
away
a
small
craft
shot
out
into
the
creek
it
was
undoubtedly
the
same
white
dinghy
which
they
had
seen
before
and
contained
the
same
tall
fair
man
who
had
spoken
with
their
he
rowed
forward
with
a
few
rapid
strokes
then
seeing
deirdre
and
dulcie
he
paused
took
a
searching
glance
round
the
shore
turned
his
boat
and
rowed
away
from
the
island
passing
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
the
shelter
of
the
next
of
the
group
deirdre
stood
watching
him
through
the
as
he
disappeared
she
was
not
altogether
sure
whether
she
had
not
made
a
false
move
it
was
perhaps
hardly
wise
to
have
thus
put
him
on
his
guard
and
let
him
become
aware
that
they
knew
of
the
curlew
signal
she
already
regretted
her
hasty
thoughtless
act
she
was
conscious
that
it
would
defeat
her
own
ends
it
seemed
no
use
staying
any
longer
in
the
creek
for
he
would
certainly
not
be
likely
to
return
after
such
an
alarm
we
better
go
and
find
miss
harding
suggested
dulcie
it
was
undoubtedly
high
time
they
reported
themselves
so
putting
the
back
in
their
case
they
set
off
for
the
other
side
of
the
island
arrived
at
the
opposite
cove
they
looked
eagerly
for
their
but
nobody
was
to
be
seen
i
expect
they
a
little
farther
on
suggested
deirdre
hiding
the
fear
she
dared
not
own
but
they
were
not
farther
on
and
though
the
girls
climbed
the
cliff
so
as
to
have
a
thorough
view
of
the
shore
and
shouted
and
cooeed
till
they
were
hoarse
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
human
being
anywhere
far
on
the
horizon
were
three
tiny
specks
dulcie
took
out
the
glasses
and
adjusted
the
focus
anxiously
one
glance
confirmed
her
worst
apprehensions
the
boats
had
gone
and
left
them
behind
it
was
perfectly
easy
to
see
how
it
had
happened
miss
birks
having
sent
them
specially
across
the
sound
believed
them
to
be
with
miss
harding
party
and
miss
harding
did
not
even
know
that
they
had
left
the
larger
island
it
was
their
own
fault
entirely
for
not
reporting
themselves
while
they
had
been
watching
the
mysterious
boatman
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
island
the
others
must
have
been
starting
utterly
unconscious
that
two
of
their
number
were
missing
we
marooned
that
what
it
amounts
to
deirdre
voice
shook
a
little
as
she
made
the
unwelcome
admission
well
of
all
idiots
we
the
biggest
we
have
got
ourselves
into
a
jolly
fix
exploded
dulcie
it
was
highly
probable
that
they
would
not
be
missed
until
the
arrival
at
the
harbour
then
no
doubt
someone
would
come
back
for
them
but
the
tide
was
rising
rapidly
and
perhaps
by
the
time
a
boat
could
return
it
would
not
be
possible
to
land
and
take
them
off
the
prospect
of
a
night
spent
on
a
desert
island
was
not
enlivening
then
too
came
another
fear
the
mysterious
stranger
was
in
the
near
neighbourhood
hidden
behind
rocks
and
creeks
he
might
have
accomplices
who
might
take
it
into
their
heads
to
reconnoitre
the
idea
was
horrible
they
felt
an
intense
dread
of
the
unknown
man
in
the
brown
jersey
he
must
be
very
angry
that
they
had
discovered
his
signal
suppose
he
were
to
find
them
and
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
them
they
bitterly
rued
their
folly
though
that
did
not
mend
matters
in
the
least
we
wo
go
over
to
that
side
of
the
island
again
in
case
he
might
see
us
quavered
dulcie
let
us
sit
down
here
in
this
sheltered
corner
how
cold
it
getting
i
hungry
too
sighed
deirdre
there
nothing
to
eat
on
the
place
except
raw
periwinkles
the
sun
had
set
behind
a
bank
of
grey
clouds
and
even
in
the
last
ten
minutes
the
daylight
had
faded
noticeably
a
chilly
wind
had
sprung
up
and
the
girls
shivered
as
they
buttoned
their
coats
closely
do
you
hear
something
said
dulcie
presently
it
was
a
sound
of
oars
and
both
pricked
up
their
ears
they
did
not
venture
to
show
themselves
till
they
could
ascertain
whether
it
were
friend
or
enemy
hidden
under
the
shadow
of
the
rock
they
watched
the
darkening
water
then
gripped
each
hands
in
terror
it
was
the
white
boat
that
appeared
round
the
corner
its
occupant
was
rowing
slowly
and
leisurely
with
a
careful
eye
on
the
shore
as
he
went
would
he
see
them
they
were
only
partially
concealed
and
a
keen
observer
might
easily
detect
their
presence
to
deirdre
those
few
minutes
equalled
years
of
agony
her
lively
imagination
summoned
up
every
possible
horror
he
paused
at
last
on
his
oars
and
gave
the
long
shrill
curlew
call
a
hundred
seagulls
screamed
in
reply
twice
thrice
he
repeated
it
then
apparently
judging
it
a
failure
he
rowed
away
in
the
direction
of
the
mainland
dulcie
was
crying
with
fright
and
cold
she
let
the
tears
trickle
unwiped
down
her
plump
cheeks
she
was
not
cut
out
by
nature
for
a
heroine
and
would
gladly
just
then
have
given
up
all
chance
of
seeing
her
portrait
in
the
newspapers
if
she
could
have
found
herself
safely
back
in
the
schoolroom
at
the
dower
house
adventures
might
be
all
very
well
in
their
way
but
this
one
had
gone
decidedly
too
far
i
wish
you
never
suggested
our
coming
she
said
fretfully
it
was
your
fault
deirdre
do
be
mean
and
try
and
throw
the
blame
on
me
you
were
just
as
keen
as
i
was
i
not
keen
now
i
wish
to
goodness
we
never
bothered
our
heads
about
gerda
you
wo
catch
me
on
such
a
chase
again
i
utterly
disgusted
with
you
dulcie
wilcox
returned
deirdre
witheringly
and
dulcie
wept
yet
harder
to
have
added
to
her
physical
troubles
a
quarrel
with
her
chum
it
was
almost
dark
before
a
search
party
consisting
of
miss
birks
and
three
boatmen
arrived
to
fetch
them
and
the
tide
had
risen
so
high
that
it
was
impossible
to
land
as
before
so
that
john
pengelly
had
to
wade
through
the
water
and
carry
each
of
them
in
turn
on
his
back
to
the
boat
miss
birks
said
little
but
they
knew
it
was
the
ominous
silence
before
a
storm
and
that
she
would
have
much
to
say
on
the
morrow
they
were
intensely
thankful
when
they
at
last
saw
the
lights
of
pontperran
and
felt
they
were
within
measurable
distance
of
food
and
fire
you
provided
a
nice
birthday
treat
for
miss
birks
i
must
say
commented
jessie
macpherson
sarcastically
what
possessed
you
to
go
off
on
your
own
in
that
silly
way
there
was
nothing
in
the
least
interesting
on
that
side
of
the
island
and
you
knew
where
we
were
and
that
we
should
be
starting
almost
directly
i
simply
ca
understand
such
foolishness
why
did
you
do
it
but
an
explanation
of
the
motives
that
had
influenced
their
conduct
was
the
very
last
thing
in
the
world
that
deirdre
and
dulcie
felt
disposed
to
offer
even
to
mitigate
the
scorn
of
the
head
girl
chapter
xi
coriolanus
it
was
an
custom
at
the
dower
house
that
at
the
end
of
every
term
the
girls
must
make
a
special
effort
to
distinguish
themselves
they
would
get
up
a
play
or
a
concert
or
a
shakespeare
reading
sometimes
a
show
of
paintings
carving
and
needlework
or
a
exhibition
of
physical
exercises
and
drill
it
was
quite
an
informal
affair
only
intended
for
themselves
and
the
mistresses
though
occasionally
miss
birks
invited
a
few
friends
to
help
to
swell
the
audience
now
april
was
here
the
easter
holidays
seemed
fast
approaching
and
preparations
were
accordingly
made
for
the
usual
function
as
a
rule
the
girls
organized
the
affair
themselves
under
the
direction
of
the
sixth
form
but
this
term
miss
harding
stepped
in
and
assumed
the
management
she
decreed
that
all
the
members
of
the
latin
classes
should
give
a
latin
play
and
selected
a
version
of
for
their
performance
about
half
the
school
took
latin
just
enough
to
make
up
the
cast
required
so
both
senior
and
junior
students
were
set
to
work
to
learn
speeches
and
get
up
orations
at
first
they
were
entirely
dismayed
at
the
prospect
of
so
arduous
an
undertaking
i
hardly
thought
miss
harding
was
serious
when
she
proposed
it
said
annie
pridwell
who
with
deirdre
dulcie
and
gerda
made
up
the
four
representatives
of
vb
serious
enough
in
all
conscience
groaned
dulcie
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
small
volume
with
an
air
of
special
tragedy
volumnia
volumnia
yes
here
she
comes
again
volumnia
oh
why
am
i
chosen
for
volumnia
i
never
get
all
this
stuff
into
my
head
you
look
the
character
nicely
said
annie
consolingly
really
rather
a
classic
sort
of
nose
and
you
have
a
big
distaff
and
spindle
and
be
spinning
as
you
talk
that
wo
help
me
to
remember
my
part
unless
i
can
write
it
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
hide
it
among
the
flax
i
declare
it
not
fair
volumnia
has
far
more
to
say
than
tullus
attius
or
sicinius
you
ought
to
have
something
extra
tagged
on
to
your
parts
we
quite
enough
thanks
declared
deirdre
and
annie
hastily
as
for
gerda
continued
dulcie
she
being
let
off
too
easily
altogether
her
senator
speech
is
only
eight
lines
well
it
my
first
term
at
latin
remember
said
gerda
jessie
macpherson
will
have
to
swot
like
anything
to
get
up
marcus
coriolanus
i
glad
i
not
picked
for
the
show
part
anyhow
jessie
wo
mind
swotting
if
she
has
a
chance
to
shine
there
have
been
trouble
if
she
had
to
play
second
fiddle
no
one
would
be
rash
enough
to
suggest
that
she
not
head
of
the
school
for
nothing
look
here
is
this
play
to
be
part
of
the
latin
lesson
or
an
extra
shall
we
be
excused
our
ordinary
not
a
line
oh
what
a
shame
then
it
giving
us
double
lessons
i
wish
miss
harding
had
left
us
to
get
up
a
concert
by
ourselves
although
the
girls
might
grumble
and
make
rather
a
fuss
over
learning
their
parts
they
soon
committed
the
little
play
to
memory
and
thanks
to
miss
harding
efforts
rehearsals
went
briskly
jessie
macpherson
whose
cleverness
certainly
justified
her
assumption
of
general
superiority
rose
to
the
occasion
nobly
and
tripped
off
her
long
speeches
as
if
latin
were
her
mother
tongue
to
the
envy
and
admiration
of
those
who
still
halted
and
stumbled
jessie
had
got
through
her
grammar
before
she
came
to
the
dower
house
though
said
irene
jordan
herself
a
beginner
it
gives
her
an
enormous
pull
to
have
started
early
boys
schools
get
up
ever
such
grand
latin
plays
remarked
rhoda
wilkins
at
orton
college
where
my
brothers
go
they
did
the
of
terence
we
went
to
see
it
and
it
was
splendid
it
took
fully
two
hours
ours
wo
take
one
well
one
expects
boys
to
be
better
at
latin
some
girls
schools
run
them
hard
said
phyllis
rowland
i
know
girls
who
can
beat
their
brothers
oh
yes
at
the
big
high
schools
where
you
choose
classics
or
modern
languages
and
stick
to
one
side
at
the
dower
house
we
dabble
in
everything
all
round
and
science
and
accomplishments
thrown
in
as
well
well
it
gives
you
the
chance
to
see
which
you
like
best
the
most
serious
question
in
connection
with
the
performance
was
the
arrangement
of
the
costumes
miss
harding
and
the
elder
girls
pored
over
illustrated
roman
histories
and
classical
dictionaries
trying
to
get
the
exact
style
of
the
period
it
difficult
to
reproduce
with
materials
said
the
mistress
one
feels
all
the
linens
ought
to
be
homespun
and
woven
in
a
loom
like
penelope
and
as
for
the
scenery
well
we
shall
just
have
to
do
the
best
we
can
as
long
as
we
avoid
anachronisms
we
shall
be
all
right
said
jessie
macpherson
we
shall
have
to
leave
something
to
the
imagination
of
the
audience
the
whole
school
was
requisitioned
to
help
and
large
working
parties
were
held
in
the
the
girls
found
it
an
amusement
to
hem
togas
or
construct
shields
out
of
cardboard
and
brown
paper
and
stitched
quite
elaborate
borders
on
the
robes
of
veturia
volumnia
and
valeria
one
of
the
difficulties
that
presented
itself
was
the
question
of
footgear
roman
matrons
did
not
wear
serviceable
school
shoes
with
heels
or
elegant
french
ones
either
it
would
certainly
be
necessary
to
contrive
sandals
we
ca
cut
our
best
shoes
down
for
the
occasion
said
marcia
richards
i
leave
the
school
first
returned
phyllis
rowland
hiring
roman
sandals
was
too
great
an
expense
and
an
ambitious
attempt
of
jessie
macpherson
to
make
them
out
of
paper
turned
out
a
ghastly
failure
in
the
end
miss
harding
cut
some
from
strips
of
cloth
and
this
effect
proved
classical
enough
to
serve
the
purpose
that
will
be
the
best
we
can
manage
she
said
i
thankful
i
have
to
do
a
dance
in
mine
it
would
be
a
queer
sort
of
shuffle
confided
dulcie
to
her
chum
in
honour
of
the
very
special
effort
which
was
being
made
miss
birks
decided
to
send
a
number
of
invitations
and
ask
quite
a
considerable
gathering
to
an
afternoon
performance
it
going
to
be
really
a
swell
thing
for
once
said
deirdre
i
hear
miss
birks
is
getting
new
curtains
those
old
ones
are
quite
worn
out
and
the
joiner
is
to
come
and
fix
a
rod
and
there
to
be
tea
after
the
entertainment
such
heaps
of
people
are
coming
who
asked
gerda
oh
major
and
hargreaves
and
their
little
boys
and
canon
hall
and
miss
hall
and
and
dawes
and
all
the
four
miss
hirsts
and
the
rector
of
kergoff
and
lawson
and
of
course
mrs
trevellyan
and
ronnie
rather
we
would
leave
ronnie
out
of
it
miss
herbert
is
to
come
too
if
she
has
gone
home
for
the
holidays
you
never
seen
trevellyan
yet
gerda
put
in
dulcie
only
in
church
well
but
i
mean
to
speak
to
you
did
go
to
ronnie
birthday
party
and
the
day
she
came
here
you
were
as
shy
as
a
baby
and
scooted
out
of
the
way
i
ca
help
being
shy
returned
gerda
blushing
up
to
the
very
tips
of
her
ears
why
there
you
are
turning
as
red
as
a
boiled
lobster
miss
birks
says
shyness
is
mostly
morbid
and
is
anything
to
be
proud
of
why
do
you
try
to
get
out
of
it
it
looks
silly
to
colour
up
like
that
over
simply
nothing
at
all
i
be
ashamed
of
it
said
dulcie
who
could
be
severe
on
other
people
faults
though
she
demanded
charity
for
her
own
gerda
copying
heroines
mocked
deirdre
they
always
tried
to
outvie
the
rose
did
herrick
write
a
sonnet
to
his
julia
blushes
and
i
sure
i
remember
reading
somewhere
sweet
and
fair
beyond
compare
are
daphne
cheeks
and
daphne
blushing
cheeks
i
swear
go
it
gerda
can
you
possibly
get
a
little
redder
if
you
try
if
you
outvie
the
rose
there
still
the
peony
left
gerda
took
her
teasing
as
she
took
everything
else
at
the
dower
house
with
little
or
no
remonstrance
it
would
have
pleased
the
girls
much
better
if
they
could
have
raised
a
spark
out
of
her
her
queer
reserve
was
not
at
all
to
their
taste
and
they
awarded
the
palm
of
popularity
to
betty
scott
whose
high
spirits
perpetual
jokes
and
amusing
tongue
made
her
the
public
entertainer
of
the
form
i
wish
betty
were
acting
sighed
dulcie
she
always
the
life
and
soul
of
a
play
it
was
very
stupid
of
her
mother
not
to
want
her
to
learn
latin
i
afraid
gerda
be
a
perfect
stick
as
ancus
vinitius
whispered
deirdre
an
absolute
dummy
agreed
her
chum
but
they
underestimated
gerda
talents
her
part
was
a
small
one
yet
she
rendered
it
excellently
she
walked
acted
and
spoke
with
a
calm
dignity
well
in
keeping
with
the
character
she
represented
everybody
agreed
that
she
made
a
most
reverend
and
stately
senator
i
ought
to
look
old
though
she
maintained
it
absurd
for
us
all
to
look
so
youthful
powder
your
hair
suggested
irene
not
enough
i
think
i
can
do
better
than
that
rather
to
the
girls
amusement
gerda
seemed
more
than
ordinarily
anxious
about
her
costume
she
could
make
more
fuss
if
she
was
taking
coriolanus
himself
laughed
dulcie
the
senator
might
be
the
chief
part
gerda
had
notions
of
her
own
which
she
proceeded
to
carry
out
she
went
to
jessie
macpherson
and
borrowed
the
white
wig
and
with
the
help
of
some
more
sheep
wool
contrived
a
beard
to
match
on
the
afternoon
of
the
performance
she
not
only
donned
these
but
blackened
her
eyebrows
and
painted
her
face
with
a
series
of
wrinkles
and
why
it
splendid
exclaimed
the
girls
you
look
seventy
at
the
very
least
just
the
sort
of
venerable
old
city
father
you
meant
for
you
hardly
know
me
would
you
enquired
gerda
casually
nobody
would
know
you
i
do
believe
even
miss
birks
will
recognize
you
it
the
best
of
anybody
jessie
be
proud
to
see
her
wig
used
after
all
she
almost
wish
she
worn
it
herself
the
performers
found
the
dressing
nearly
the
greatest
part
of
the
fun
they
arranged
volumnia
classical
garments
and
ornaments
adjusted
her
gold
fillet
draped
the
folds
of
veturia
flowing
robe
and
persuaded
brutus
to
abandon
spectacles
for
the
occasion
you
forget
we
supposed
to
be
in
remarked
jessie
macpherson
i
shall
be
blind
without
them
objected
brutus
never
mind
you
must
catch
hold
of
sicinius
toga
if
you
get
into
difficulties
the
chinese
used
spectacles
ages
ago
could
a
pair
of
them
have
got
imported
into
rome
certainly
not
those
goggles
of
yours
would
spoil
the
whole
classical
spirit
of
the
play
and
i
sha
allow
them
well
i
suppose
i
worry
through
somehow
but
if
i
upset
the
rostrum
do
blame
me
you
just
got
to
go
through
your
part
without
upsetting
anything
spectacles
or
no
spectacles
or
you
have
to
settle
with
me
afterwards
observed
jessie
grimly
by
three
all
the
invited
guests
had
arrived
and
taken
their
places
in
the
where
a
temporary
platform
had
been
put
up
from
behind
the
curtains
the
performers
could
take
surreptitious
peeps
and
watch
the
arrival
of
the
audience
dulcie
with
her
eye
at
a
tiny
opening
reported
progress
to
the
others
there
the
vicar
there
hargreaves
with
all
the
boys
canon
hall
oh
here
trevellyan
and
miss
herbert
and
ronnie
behind
her
where
are
they
sitting
asked
gerda
right
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
do
you
want
to
peep
thanks
just
for
a
second
tell
me
is
my
beard
all
right
miss
birks
or
anyone
else
would
know
me
not
from
adam
what
a
fuss
you
make
about
your
costume
said
dulcie
impatiently
nobody
notice
it
all
that
much
there
are
ten
others
acting
as
well
as
yourself
i
glad
you
snubbed
her
said
deirdre
as
gerda
having
taken
her
peep
between
the
curtains
retired
to
the
back
of
the
stage
she
really
needs
it
sometimes
it
is
good
for
people
to
let
them
get
swollen
head
are
you
all
ready
asked
miss
harding
anxiously
then
ring
the
bell
marcia
now
rhoda
do
forget
your
cue
verborum
and
remember
to
speak
up
and
doris
do
put
the
right
accent
on
et
decorum
est
pro
patria
mori
i
shall
be
so
ashamed
if
you
get
it
wrong
the
audience
clapped
vigorously
as
the
curtains
parted
and
disclosed
an
atrium
with
veturia
and
volumnia
seated
spinning
and
chatting
as
roman
matrons
may
very
possibly
have
chatted
in
the
year
the
scene
was
really
pretty
and
became
impressive
when
caius
marcius
arrived
with
his
proud
news
jessie
macpherson
had
an
excellent
idea
of
acting
and
as
her
features
were
classical
she
made
an
ideal
personation
of
the
future
coriolanus
putting
just
the
right
amount
of
aristocratic
haughtiness
into
her
demeanour
and
calm
command
into
her
tone
of
voice
miss
harding
had
been
nervous
about
many
points
but
as
the
play
went
on
and
scene
succeeded
scene
she
breathed
more
freely
every
girl
was
on
her
mettle
to
do
her
best
and
things
that
had
dragged
even
at
the
dress
rehearsal
now
went
briskly
nobody
needed
prompting
and
nobody
forgot
her
cue
all
spoke
up
audibly
and
even
the
lictor
who
had
been
the
most
difficult
to
train
did
not
turn
his
back
on
the
audience
though
many
of
the
guests
certainly
could
not
understand
the
dialogue
the
plot
of
the
play
was
so
palpable
that
all
could
easily
follow
the
story
from
its
interesting
opening
to
the
end
coriolanus
died
nobly
and
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
really
heroic
disregard
of
possible
bruises
and
veturia
commanded
the
sympathy
of
the
entire
room
as
she
shared
his
fate
the
performers
received
quite
an
ovation
as
they
stood
in
a
line
making
their
bows
really
miss
birks
your
girls
are
too
clever
for
anything
remarked
canon
hall
their
latin
was
most
excellent
the
soft
pronunciation
makes
it
sound
just
like
italian
said
trevellyan
they
deserve
many
congratulations
yes
they
caught
the
classical
spirit
of
the
thing
so
well
agreed
poynter
the
vicar
considering
that
many
of
them
are
beginners
i
think
it
is
fairly
well
to
their
credit
and
certainly
to
miss
harding
said
miss
birks
this
is
the
first
latin
play
they
have
attempted
another
time
they
will
do
better
the
next
part
of
the
function
was
tea
in
the
to
which
guests
and
pupils
were
alike
invited
be
quick
and
change
your
costumes
commanded
coriolanus
behind
the
scenes
here
somebody
please
unfasten
me
at
the
back
where
are
my
shoes
gone
to
why
need
we
change
interposed
gerda
quickly
it
will
take
so
long
tea
be
over
before
we
ready
why
ca
we
go
in
as
we
are
oh
yes
let
us
keep
on
our
costumes
agreed
dulcie
who
liked
being
a
roman
lady
miss
harding
may
we
have
tea
in
character
why
i
dare
say
it
will
amuse
the
visitors
yes
run
in
as
you
are
if
you
wish
gerda
would
you
like
to
take
off
that
beard
and
wash
your
face
come
here
and
i
help
you
no
thanks
i
rather
keep
it
on
really
i
do
know
how
you
negotiate
any
tea
i
do
mind
the
eleven
performers
made
quite
a
sensation
as
they
filed
into
the
all
the
children
among
the
guests
wanted
to
examine
their
garments
and
handle
their
mock
daggers
ronnie
in
particular
persisted
in
calling
his
aunt
attention
to
every
detail
i
like
jessie
and
rhoda
and
hilda
the
best
he
declared
frankly
i
did
know
marcia
at
first
and
who
do
you
think
that
old
man
is
gerda
gerda
thorwaldson
gerda
do
let
auntie
look
at
you
yes
you
must
come
i
drag
you
here
she
is
auntie
how
do
you
do
my
dear
your
seems
excellent
said
trevellyan
kindly
smiling
as
the
senator
blushed
furiously
under
his
painted
wrinkles
ronnie
you
must
be
naughty
do
hold
her
if
she
wants
to
go
what
a
little
tyrant
you
are
gerda
is
such
a
very
shy
girl
said
miss
birks
as
ronnie
loosed
his
hold
and
ancus
vinitius
made
his
escape
i
always
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
speak
to
strangers
it
amounts
to
a
fault
a
pardonable
failing
at
her
age
returned
trevellyan
outgrow
it
presently
no
doubt
at
any
rate
it
pleasanter
than
too
great
which
is
generally
the
reproach
cast
at
young
people
of
the
period
it
quite
refreshing
nowadays
to
meet
a
girl
who
is
shy
chapter
xii
in
quarantine
however
excellent
the
arrangements
of
a
school
and
however
happy
the
girls
may
be
there
the
word
holidays
nevertheless
holds
a
magic
attraction
miss
birks
pupils
thoroughly
appreciated
the
dower
house
but
they
would
not
have
been
human
if
they
had
not
rejoiced
openly
in
the
immediate
prospect
of
day
already
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
general
exodus
the
gardener
was
carrying
down
trunks
from
the
miss
harding
was
checking
the
linen
lists
and
the
girls
were
sorting
the
contents
of
their
drawers
and
deciding
what
must
be
left
and
what
taken
home
these
are
going
to
be
holidays
triumphed
deirdre
you
know
my
sister
at
school
at
madame
mesurier
near
versailles
well
mother
and
i
are
to
have
ten
days
in
paris
so
that
we
can
see
eileen
and
take
her
about
wo
it
be
absolutely
ripping
i
never
been
abroad
before
and
i
just
living
for
it
we
to
go
and
see
all
the
sights
eileen
looking
forward
to
it
as
much
as
i
am
i
going
to
stay
with
my
cousins
in
hampshire
said
dulcie
mad
on
horses
so
i
shall
get
some
riding
they
always
give
me
the
sweetest
little
chestnut
cob
she
goes
like
a
bird
and
yet
she
so
gentle
when
we
not
riding
we
play
golf
their
links
are
gorgeous
where
are
you
going
gerda
asked
deirdre
to
london
to
meet
mother
replied
gerda
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
such
as
the
chums
had
not
seen
since
she
arrived
she
offered
no
details
of
further
plans
but
evidently
the
prospect
satisfied
her
all
three
girls
were
counting
the
hours
till
their
departure
there
is
a
dour
old
proverb
however
which
states
that
there
many
a
slip
cup
and
lip
and
for
once
its
pessimistic
philosophy
was
justified
on
the
very
morning
of
the
day
deirdre
who
had
passed
a
funny
feverish
night
woke
up
to
find
her
face
covered
with
a
rash
dulcie
went
for
miss
birks
who
after
inspecting
the
invalid
and
finding
on
enquiry
that
both
dulcie
and
gerda
had
slight
sore
throats
forbade
the
three
to
leave
their
bedroom
until
they
had
been
seen
by
a
medical
man
very
much
disconcerted
they
took
breakfast
in
bed
it
may
be
only
said
deirdre
i
had
it
once
before
when
i
eaten
something
that
disagreed
with
me
and
i
expect
gerda
and
i
caught
cold
on
the
warren
yesterday
no
doubt
it
nothing
said
dulcie
trying
to
thrust
away
the
horrible
apprehensions
that
oppressed
her
when
jones
arrived
however
and
examined
his
patients
he
sounded
the
of
their
hopes
he
pronounced
deirdre
to
be
suffering
from
a
slight
attack
of
german
measles
and
from
dulcie
and
symptoms
diagnosed
that
they
were
sickening
for
the
same
complaint
the
rash
will
probably
be
out
he
announced
with
care
in
the
initial
stages
it
should
prove
nothing
serious
but
for
the
present
they
are
as
well
in
bed
the
three
victims
could
hardly
believe
the
calamity
that
had
overtaken
them
to
stop
in
bed
with
measles
when
their
boxes
were
packed
and
the
last
things
ready
to
go
into
their
and
their
trains
arranged
and
their
relations
notified
of
the
time
of
their
arrival
it
it
rotten
exclaimed
deirdre
turning
her
flushed
face
to
the
wall
if
it
german
measles
i
believe
it
your
fault
gerda
declared
dulcie
weeping
openly
i
did
start
them
objected
poor
gerda
you
had
them
packed
in
your
box
then
snapped
dulcie
who
was
thoroughly
cross
and
unreasonable
oh
wo
it
make
a
pretty
hullaballoo
in
the
school
the
sympathies
of
the
moment
might
well
be
with
miss
birks
she
had
caused
each
of
her
remaining
seventeen
pupils
to
be
examined
by
the
doctor
and
as
all
appeared
free
from
symptoms
was
sending
off
seventeen
telegrams
to
inform
parents
of
the
circumstances
and
ask
if
they
wished
their
daughters
to
return
home
or
to
remain
in
quarantine
without
exception
the
replies
were
in
favour
of
travelling
so
the
usual
cabs
and
luggage
carts
drove
up
and
the
girls
rejoicing
greatly
were
packed
off
under
miss
harding
escort
by
the
midday
train
to
sidcombe
junction
where
they
would
change
for
their
various
destinations
in
spite
of
strict
injunctions
to
keep
warm
deirdre
got
out
of
bed
and
watched
the
departure
from
the
window
to
think
that
i
ought
to
have
been
sitting
inside
that
bus
and
my
box
ought
to
have
been
on
that
cart
she
lamented
oh
i
could
howl
mother
will
have
got
our
tickets
for
paris
i
wonder
if
she
go
without
me
oh
why
did
i
powder
my
face
and
say
nothing
about
it
you
could
have
hidden
that
rash
besides
it
horribly
dangerous
to
catch
cold
on
the
top
of
measles
get
back
into
bed
you
silly
tell
miss
birks
if
you
do
do
you
want
what
the
doctor
called
i
think
you
the
biggest
lunatic
i
know
standing
in
your
by
an
open
window
dulcie
remarks
were
sage
if
not
complimentary
so
deirdre
tore
herself
away
from
the
tantalizing
spectacle
of
the
start
below
and
dutifully
returned
to
her
pillow
just
in
time
to
save
herself
from
being
found
out
of
bed
by
miss
birks
who
having
said
to
the
travellers
came
upstairs
to
condole
with
the
three
invalids
i
ca
think
how
we
caught
it
sighed
dulcie
at
our
performance
of
i
afraid
said
miss
birks
jones
tells
me
that
all
the
little
hargreaves
are
down
with
it
he
was
called
in
to
attend
them
yesterday
probably
they
were
sickening
for
it
and
gave
you
the
infection
i
hope
ronnie
wo
have
caught
it
gasped
gerda
i
trust
not
indeed
i
sha
feel
easy
till
i
have
sent
to
the
castle
to
enquire
about
him
it
certainly
is
the
most
unfortunate
happening
but
deirdre
may
be
glad
she
had
not
started
for
paris
there
is
nothing
so
miserable
or
so
disastrously
expensive
as
to
be
laid
up
in
a
foreign
hotel
the
proprietor
would
have
demanded
large
compensation
for
measles
even
if
he
had
allowed
her
to
remain
in
the
house
probably
she
would
have
been
removed
to
a
fever
hospital
not
a
pleasant
way
of
seeing
paris
said
deirdre
summoning
up
a
smile
you
have
a
holiday
there
another
time
i
sure
and
now
you
must
all
be
brave
girls
and
try
to
make
the
best
of
things
fortunately
none
of
you
seem
likely
to
be
really
we
do
what
we
can
to
amuse
ourselves
miss
birks
spoke
brightly
and
her
cheery
manner
hid
her
own
disappointment
though
she
might
justly
have
indulged
in
a
grumble
for
she
had
been
obliged
to
cancel
all
her
arrangements
for
a
motor
tour
and
stay
to
attend
to
her
young
patients
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
them
and
the
subsequent
disinfecting
which
must
be
done
would
completely
spoil
her
holiday
she
was
not
a
woman
to
think
of
herself
however
and
she
put
her
aspect
of
the
case
so
entirely
aside
that
the
girls
never
even
suspected
that
her
regrets
were
equal
if
not
superior
to
their
own
as
the
doctor
had
prophesied
both
dulcie
and
gerda
developed
the
rash
on
the
following
day
fortunately
all
three
girls
had
the
complaint
very
slightly
and
beyond
a
touch
of
sore
throat
and
sneezing
were
not
troubled
with
any
very
disagreeable
symptoms
the
microbes
have
only
fought
a
battle
and
they
are
retiring
worsted
declared
miss
birks
they
not
as
savage
as
germs
quite
tame
ones
laughed
dulcie
germs
in
germany
are
likely
to
be
said
deirdre
with
a
quip
at
gerda
after
a
day
or
two
in
bed
jones
pronounced
his
patients
convalescent
gave
them
permission
to
go
downstairs
and
held
out
the
promise
of
a
walk
on
the
warren
if
they
continued
to
improve
their
period
of
isolation
was
a
fortnight
after
which
they
were
to
be
allowed
to
go
home
for
the
remaining
week
of
the
holidays
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
what
they
were
missing
they
might
have
congratulated
themselves
on
having
an
extremely
good
time
miss
birks
was
kindness
itself
and
allowed
every
indulgence
possible
they
were
kept
well
supplied
with
books
in
cheap
editions
which
could
be
burnt
afterwards
and
had
licence
to
pursue
any
hobby
which
admitted
of
disinfection
jones
brought
good
reports
of
the
hargreaves
children
who
were
now
convalescent
ronnie
had
most
fortunately
not
caught
any
germs
and
was
away
with
trevellyan
in
herefordshire
of
the
seventeen
girls
who
had
returned
home
irene
jordan
only
had
developed
a
slight
rash
so
that
on
the
whole
the
school
had
escaped
better
than
might
have
been
expected
after
the
constant
society
of
their
the
three
invalids
felt
the
dower
house
to
be
very
large
and
empty
and
lonely
it
was
astonishing
how
different
it
seemed
now
the
rooms
were
untenanted
the
whole
place
wore
a
changed
aspect
in
ordinary
circumstances
they
hardly
ever
gave
a
thought
to
the
ancient
associations
of
the
house
but
now
they
constantly
remembered
that
it
had
been
occupied
as
a
convent
and
that
hundreds
of
years
ago
gentle
figures
had
flitted
up
and
down
those
identical
stairs
and
paced
those
very
same
passages
it
was
the
code
of
the
school
to
laugh
at
superstition
and
none
of
the
girls
would
confess
to
a
dislike
to
go
upstairs
alone
but
it
was
remarkable
what
excuses
they
found
for
keeping
each
other
company
gerda
was
the
worst
off
in
this
respect
for
deirdre
and
dulcie
though
ready
to
accommodate
each
other
did
not
show
her
too
much
consideration
and
would
often
ruthlessly
disregard
her
palpable
hints
they
kept
very
much
together
and
though
not
openly
rude
made
her
feel
most
decidedly
that
she
was
she
never
complained
nor
offered
the
least
reproach
her
manner
throughout
was
exactly
the
same
as
it
had
been
since
her
first
arrival
gentle
reserved
and
uncommunicative
sometimes
the
chums
out
of
sheer
naughtiness
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
her
but
she
never
lost
her
and
either
kept
entire
silence
or
replied
so
quietly
to
their
gibes
that
they
were
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
to
miss
birks
gerda
did
not
open
her
heart
any
more
than
to
her
she
appeared
grateful
for
kindness
but
the
principal
best
efforts
could
not
make
her
talk
and
on
the
topic
of
her
home
and
her
relations
she
was
dumb
to
any
questions
she
would
return
the
most
brief
and
unwilling
answers
and
seemed
reluctant
to
have
the
subject
mentioned
at
all
after
several
vain
attempts
to
win
her
confidence
miss
birks
gave
up
trying
and
allowed
her
to
go
on
in
her
usual
silent
fashion
a
negative
policy
not
wholly
satisfactory
all
three
girls
made
excellent
progress
and
jones
very
soon
gave
permission
first
for
a
gentle
walk
round
the
garden
at
midday
then
for
a
longer
time
we
been
making
invalids
of
them
though
they
not
invalids
at
all
he
said
jokingly
they
nothing
but
three
humbugs
look
at
their
rosy
cheeks
and
i
hear
reports
of
such
excessive
consumption
of
chicken
broth
and
jelly
and
other
delicacies
i
shall
have
to
diet
them
on
porridge
and
potatoes
i
think
miss
birks
is
too
good
to
you
young
ladies
when
i
was
at
school
i
was
pampered
like
this
i
assure
you
whatever
infectious
complaints
i
managed
to
catch
they
used
to
dose
us
with
turkey
rhubarb
no
matter
what
our
ailment
it
was
a
kind
of
specific
against
all
diseases
and
nasty
enough
to
frighten
any
microbe
away
may
we
go
home
next
week
pleaded
deirdre
girls
who
catch
german
measles
do
deserve
to
go
home
but
i
know
miss
birks
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
so
i
wo
be
too
severe
yes
i
think
i
may
consider
you
cured
and
give
you
your
order
of
release
for
next
wednesday
that
evening
three
very
jubilant
girls
sat
in
the
small
schoolroom
scribbling
their
good
news
this
day
week
we
shall
be
at
home
rejoiced
deidre
oh
goody
i
am
so
glad
i
can
hardly
write
sense
i
hope
understand
it
she
accustomed
to
my
ragtime
letters
though
miss
birks
is
sending
post
cards
about
the
trains
volunteered
gerda
a
good
thing
too
for
i
never
remember
to
put
the
time
shall
i
read
you
what
i
said
deirdre
darling
mummie
i
coming
home
oh
is
it
spiffing
do
let
us
have
trifle
and
sausages
for
supper
and
let
baba
stop
up
for
it
i
made
her
a
present
and
it
not
infectious
because
miss
birks
has
had
it
stoved
and
it
will
be
ripping
to
see
you
all
again
so
glad
i
sha
miss
douglas
i
hope
jinks
is
well
but
let
them
bring
him
to
the
station
to
meet
me
in
case
he
gets
on
the
line
oh
high
cockalorum
for
next
week
heaps
and
heaps
of
love
from
dulcie
it
a
good
thing
miss
birks
is
sending
a
post
card
you
silly
child
remarked
deirdre
crushingly
you
never
told
your
mother
which
day
you
coming
to
say
nothing
of
mentioning
a
time
oh
have
i
no
more
i
have
i
put
it
in
a
i
hope
mother
wo
forget
i
said
trifle
and
sausages
she
always
lets
me
choose
my
own
supper
on
the
day
i
go
home
and
we
have
it
all
set
out
in
the
generally
we
only
get
biscuits
and
milk
before
we
go
to
bed
i
think
they
might
let
baba
sit
up
this
time
she
nearly
six
oh
bother
my
stamps
are
upstairs
do
come
with
me
and
i
fetch
them
i
simply
hate
going
alone
you
as
big
a
baby
as
baba
returned
deirdre
no
i
ca
and
and
sha
go
with
you
you
must
pluck
up
your
courage
for
once
dear
me
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
you
scared
mouse
thus
duly
squashed
by
her
own
chum
dulcie
made
no
further
plea
she
only
banged
the
door
in
reply
and
they
could
hear
her
footsteps
stumping
slowly
and
heavily
upstairs
in
a
few
moments
however
she
descended
with
a
much
swifter
motion
and
looking
pale
and
frightened
burst
into
the
schoolroom
there
somebody
or
something
inside
the
barred
room
she
gasped
it
whatever
it
is
it
tapping
on
the
door
i
dare
go
past
both
deirdre
and
gerda
rose
to
the
rescue
and
three
strong
the
girls
ventured
to
investigate
with
a
few
pardonable
tremors
they
drew
aside
the
curtains
that
concealed
the
door
of
the
mysterious
room
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
or
heard
however
the
iron
bars
had
not
been
tampered
with
and
all
was
dead
silence
within
your
nerves
are
jumpy
at
present
and
you
imagine
anything
decided
deirdre
i
did
imagine
it
i
really
heard
it
i
tell
you
i
did
oh
i
say
there
it
is
again
instinctively
the
girls
clung
together
for
from
inside
the
door
certainly
came
the
sound
of
rapping
not
very
loud
but
quite
unmistakable
who
there
quavered
deirdre
valiantly
but
there
was
no
reply
if
you
want
help
speak
she
continued
the
three
held
their
breath
and
listened
dead
silence
that
was
all
nor
was
the
rapping
repeated
i
heard
it
before
whispered
gerda
when
several
times
once
just
after
i
came
and
again
in
the
middle
of
the
term
and
about
three
weeks
ago
it
always
the
same
a
few
taps
and
then
it
stops
did
any
of
the
other
girls
hear
it
i
did
ask
them
it
spooky
to
a
degree
what
can
it
be
oh
do
you
think
there
anybody
inside
whimpered
dulcie
why
did
he
answer
if
there
was
he
might
be
deaf
and
dumb
oh
perhaps
that
the
secret
of
the
room
is
some
poor
creature
shut
up
there
oh
it
too
horrible
do
get
hysterical
said
deirdre
trevellyan
would
go
shutting
up
deaf
and
dumb
people
it
is
very
mysterious
though
shall
we
tell
miss
birks
suggested
dulcie
no
certainly
not
she
always
fearfully
down
on
us
if
we
get
up
any
scares
about
the
barred
room
do
you
remember
how
cross
she
was
with
annie
pridwell
and
betty
scott
last
term
do
you
ever
hear
any
other
noises
asked
gerda
no
only
what
might
reasonably
be
rats
or
mice
has
anyone
any
notion
what
inside
not
the
very
slightest
i
do
believe
even
miss
birks
knows
well
look
here
said
dulcie
i
shall
never
dare
to
go
down
this
passage
alone
again
one
of
you
will
simply
have
to
come
with
me
i
do
think
we
very
much
care
to
go
alone
ourselves
returned
deirdre
you
called
me
a
scared
mouse
dulcie
tone
was
injured
as
if
the
epithet
still
rankled
well
we
three
scared
mice
and
it
a
case
of
how
they
run
laughed
deirdre
getting
back
her
we
go
up
and
down
in
threesomes
for
the
future
you
promise
you
never
make
me
pass
here
by
myself
again
faithfully
on
my
honour
we
act
police
and
protect
you
against
a
dozen
possible
spooks
do
stop
squeezing
my
arm
you
made
it
quite
sore
i
do
know
how
it
is
deirdre
you
never
take
things
seriously
i
ca
see
anything
to
laugh
about
myself
the
whole
thing
queer
and
uncanny
and
mysterious
and
i
hate
mysteries
why
ca
trevellyan
have
the
bars
taken
down
and
let
us
look
into
the
room
ah
ask
me
a
harder
i
nodded
nearly
napping
suddenly
there
came
a
tapping
as
of
someone
gently
rapping
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
quoted
gerda
who
was
learning
the
raven
you
both
determined
to
make
fun
of
it
and
it
is
a
laughing
matter
complained
dulcie
i
have
got
my
stamps
yet
come
along
chapter
xiii
the
anniversary
on
the
following
wednesday
three
girls
took
their
places
in
the
train
and
started
off
for
the
short
remainder
of
their
holiday
i
wish
we
did
smell
so
horribly
of
carbolic
protested
dulcie
sure
everybody
think
we
coming
from
a
fever
hospital
and
give
us
a
wide
berth
all
the
better
if
we
can
keep
the
carriage
to
ourselves
chuckled
deirdre
those
three
old
ladies
were
just
going
to
come
in
when
they
turned
suspicious
and
sheered
off
in
a
hurry
i
feel
rather
inclined
to
label
myself
from
measles
then
you
come
under
the
infectious
diseases
act
and
be
fined
for
travelling
in
a
public
conveyance
perhaps
they
turn
you
out
and
put
you
in
the
guard
van
to
give
him
measles
how
kind
but
i
travel
in
a
to
get
home
only
one
week
of
the
holidays
left
i
mean
to
get
the
most
amazing
amount
into
the
time
i
assure
you
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
travelling
together
to
wexminster
where
their
ways
parted
and
gerda
was
to
go
on
to
hunstan
junction
where
she
would
be
met
by
a
relative
if
she
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
she
did
not
betray
much
excitement
nor
did
she
vouchsafe
any
details
of
what
was
in
store
for
her
the
chums
were
too
busy
with
their
own
plans
to
concern
themselves
with
hers
and
jumped
out
of
the
train
at
wexminster
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
almost
forgot
to
bid
her
rather
dulcie
remembered
just
in
time
and
turned
back
to
the
carriage
window
i
hope
you
have
as
jolly
holidays
as
mine
she
called
thank
you
said
gerda
waving
her
hand
with
a
wan
little
smile
as
the
train
began
to
move
and
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
known
one
another
it
struck
dulcie
that
there
was
something
infinitely
sad
and
pathetic
about
her
mysterious
could
she
really
be
a
spy
the
chums
had
discussed
the
question
again
and
again
her
german
associations
her
intense
reserve
and
above
all
her
incriminating
meetings
on
the
shore
seemed
highly
suspicious
what
was
the
secret
that
she
so
persistently
concealed
and
what
the
explanation
of
the
letter
she
had
placed
in
the
bottle
for
the
present
the
riddle
must
remain
unanswered
both
they
and
she
had
turned
their
backs
on
pontperran
for
one
brief
week
and
during
that
time
neither
suspicions
nor
speculations
must
disturb
the
full
bliss
of
their
belated
holiday
deirdre
and
dulcie
made
up
for
the
shortness
of
the
vacation
by
the
thorough
enjoyment
of
each
precious
day
and
when
they
returned
to
the
dower
house
had
enough
material
for
conversation
to
last
them
a
month
or
more
even
gerda
appeared
cheered
by
the
change
though
she
did
not
offer
any
details
of
her
doings
she
admitted
she
had
enjoyed
herself
in
london
she
looked
brighter
and
was
more
ready
than
formerly
to
join
in
the
life
of
the
school
and
take
some
part
in
all
that
was
going
on
the
chums
watched
her
closely
but
found
her
conduct
perfectly
regular
and
orthodox
she
indulged
in
no
more
surreptitious
expeditions
to
the
shore
and
did
not
attempt
when
on
the
warren
to
separate
herself
from
the
others
since
the
day
they
had
been
marooned
on
the
island
deirdre
and
dulcie
had
not
seen
the
stranger
again
they
concluded
that
he
must
have
left
the
neighbourhood
and
have
suspended
his
evil
designs
till
a
more
favourable
season
though
they
could
not
in
any
degree
trust
her
they
certainly
found
gerda
a
more
genial
companion
than
she
had
been
last
term
her
reserve
about
her
own
affairs
remained
unshaken
but
she
began
to
show
an
interest
in
school
doings
she
took
keenly
to
tennis
and
improved
so
rapidly
that
she
was
soon
one
of
the
best
players
and
even
vanquished
jessie
macpherson
in
singles
a
great
triumph
for
vb
she
the
sphinx
still
but
she
not
quite
so
bad
as
she
was
before
said
dulcie
the
bedroom
shared
by
the
three
girls
had
been
well
disinfected
and
repapered
before
their
return
after
the
measles
they
themselves
were
regarded
rather
in
the
light
of
heroines
by
the
others
you
were
quite
clever
enough
though
said
betty
scott
if
managed
to
catch
it
in
term
time
it
would
have
been
a
real
excitement
and
perhaps
it
would
have
spread
and
we
should
have
had
one
of
the
dormitories
turned
into
a
nice
little
hospital
betty
spoke
regretfully
as
if
she
had
lost
an
opportunity
which
might
not
occur
again
evidently
measles
at
school
was
an
experience
she
craved
for
not
a
solitary
germ
however
had
survived
the
stoving
and
whitewashing
and
the
health
record
at
the
dower
house
maintained
its
former
standard
of
excellence
the
summer
term
was
always
of
more
than
usual
interest
the
school
lived
largely
many
classes
were
held
in
the
garden
and
meals
when
weather
permitted
were
often
taken
on
the
lawn
the
girls
would
particularly
petition
for
breakfast
in
the
open
air
it
was
delightful
to
sit
in
the
warmth
of
the
early
morning
sunshine
with
birds
singing
in
chorus
in
the
trees
and
shrubs
around
and
the
scent
of
lilac
and
hawthorn
wafted
by
the
gentle
little
breeze
that
was
blowing
white
caps
to
the
waves
on
the
gleaming
sea
below
the
cliffs
the
whole
neighbourhood
of
pontperran
changed
annually
after
easter
during
the
winter
it
was
as
sleepy
and
quiet
a
spot
as
could
be
imagined
with
no
excitements
beyond
an
occasional
temperance
meeting
or
village
concert
in
the
summer
it
woke
up
every
farm
or
cottage
that
had
a
room
to
spare
let
it
to
visitors
the
place
had
a
reputation
amongst
both
artists
and
anglers
and
throughout
the
season
easels
might
be
seen
pitched
at
every
picturesque
corner
and
the
one
hotel
blossomed
out
into
the
of
the
izaak
walton
club
so
long
as
the
visitors
did
not
attempt
to
trespass
on
the
headland
the
girls
rather
enjoyed
their
advent
it
was
interesting
to
try
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
an
picture
as
they
passed
his
easel
and
the
added
gaiety
in
the
village
found
its
way
to
the
school
miss
birks
took
her
pupils
to
an
occasional
concert
or
entertainment
and
never
omitted
to
let
them
attend
such
important
functions
as
hospital
saturday
parade
and
the
celebrations
it
had
been
decided
by
the
local
authorities
this
year
to
keep
the
anniversary
on
whit
monday
on
that
day
large
numbers
of
visitors
often
came
to
pontperran
from
other
seaside
places
a
circumstance
which
would
largely
enhance
the
possibility
of
a
good
collection
the
girls
at
the
dower
house
having
had
a
long
easter
holiday
were
not
going
home
for
whitsuntide
so
with
miss
permission
they
were
pressed
into
the
service
and
requisitioned
to
sell
flowers
and
take
donations
as
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
been
allowed
to
play
such
a
public
part
they
were
much
delighted
and
excited
it
as
good
as
a
bazaar
only
more
fun
because
it
will
be
in
the
streets
said
evie
bennett
we
just
make
people
buy
announced
annie
pridwell
i
not
going
to
take
a
single
flower
back
with
me
i
made
up
my
mind
about
that
i
hope
people
will
feel
generous
said
elyned
hughes
it
was
arranged
that
the
girls
should
be
dressed
in
white
and
should
wear
their
school
hats
and
a
badge
consisting
of
a
scarlet
sash
tied
over
the
shoulder
and
under
one
arm
the
flowers
imitation
were
supplied
at
the
public
hall
they
were
made
into
tiny
buttonholes
which
were
to
be
sold
for
the
sum
of
twopence
or
anything
more
that
the
charitable
felt
disposed
to
give
for
them
the
collectors
were
to
go
two
and
two
together
one
to
sell
the
flowers
and
the
other
to
hold
the
miniature
into
which
the
pennies
were
to
be
dropped
dulcie
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
collect
with
deirdre
but
this
miss
birks
would
not
permit
apportioning
an
elder
girl
to
each
younger
one
so
that
dulcie
instead
of
having
her
chum
for
a
partner
found
herself
rather
to
her
chagrin
placed
with
jessie
macpherson
the
head
of
the
school
it
is
going
to
be
fun
at
all
she
lamented
i
almost
as
soon
go
about
with
miss
harding
i
thought
we
should
have
had
a
ripping
time
i
undertake
jessie
will
want
to
sell
all
the
flowers
herself
and
make
me
rattle
the
box
jessie
decidedly
had
views
on
the
due
subordination
of
younger
girls
and
would
probably
have
fulfilled
dulcie
gloomy
prophecy
had
not
miss
birks
intervened
with
the
injunction
that
the
seniors
were
to
commence
the
sale
of
the
flowers
then
when
half
the
stock
was
disposed
of
the
remainder
was
to
be
handed
over
to
the
juniors
so
that
each
might
have
a
fair
part
in
the
proceedings
jessie
looked
rather
sulky
about
it
chuckled
dulcie
i
shall
see
that
those
flowers
are
divided
equally
and
she
does
take
more
than
her
legitimate
share
of
them
twenty
buttonholes
apiece
is
the
portion
i
a
good
mind
to
label
mine
this
particular
anniversary
was
to
be
one
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
for
a
new
had
been
presented
to
the
station
and
was
to
be
launched
amid
general
rejoicings
a
large
influx
of
visitors
was
expected
so
there
seemed
every
reasonable
hope
of
a
speedy
sale
of
the
pretty
little
bouquets
i
only
wish
they
been
real
flowers
said
deirdre
who
with
irene
jordan
had
been
apportioned
a
beat
in
the
main
street
near
the
principal
shops
the
real
ones
fade
so
horribly
quickly
replied
irene
they
would
have
been
drooping
by
the
time
we
got
them
down
to
the
town
and
only
last
about
an
hour
in
people
buttonholes
these
are
really
very
pretty
and
can
be
kept
as
mementoes
i
sha
part
with
mine
till
next
year
now
are
you
ready
i
going
to
tackle
that
old
gentleman
over
there
he
looks
charitably
disposed
at
first
the
girls
were
rather
shy
in
pressing
their
wares
but
people
responded
so
kindly
and
readily
that
they
took
courage
and
offered
them
even
in
unlikely
quarters
it
was
amazing
how
many
and
what
varied
customers
they
found
a
ragged
urchin
who
generally
begged
from
them
when
he
could
snatch
the
opportunity
came
up
now
and
invested
his
twopence
in
the
biggest
posy
he
could
select
standing
with
quite
the
air
of
a
dandy
as
irene
pinned
the
treasure
on
to
his
faded
little
jersey
he
dropped
the
coppers
into
the
with
keen
enjoyment
and
retired
beaming
satisfied
that
he
had
contributed
his
small
share
to
the
general
fund
day
trippers
proved
a
harvest
some
putting
threepenny
bits
or
sixpences
in
place
of
pennies
and
buying
more
than
one
bouquet
a
waggish
young
fellow
decorated
his
sailor
hat
with
enough
bunches
to
form
a
wreath
quite
finishing
irene
stock
and
encroaching
on
deirdre
half
of
the
tray
several
ladies
tied
bouquets
on
to
the
collars
of
their
pet
dogs
and
a
sweet
little
girl
insisted
upon
making
a
purchase
on
behalf
of
her
doll
a
small
very
spoilt
boy
wanted
to
carry
off
the
miniature
and
howled
lustily
when
he
realized
that
it
was
not
for
sale
but
was
consoled
when
irene
allowed
him
to
hold
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
rattle
it
suggestively
at
so
delighted
was
he
with
the
novel
occupation
that
his
nurse
could
scarcely
tear
him
away
and
it
was
only
by
the
bribe
of
a
bun
that
she
cajoled
him
into
restoring
the
box
to
its
lawful
owner
it
getting
almost
too
full
to
shake
laughed
irene
if
everyone
else
has
done
as
well
as
ourselves
this
ought
to
be
a
record
day
oh
look
there
miss
herbert
with
ronnie
they
coming
this
way
ronnie
must
have
one
of
my
bunches
if
i
buy
it
myself
and
give
it
him
declared
deirdre
but
ronnie
had
come
with
his
small
pockets
well
lined
with
pennies
which
he
was
burning
to
spend
he
gallantly
chose
a
buttonhole
for
his
governess
first
then
one
for
himself
and
would
have
added
a
third
for
his
aunt
had
not
miss
herbert
reminded
him
that
he
would
meet
other
friends
with
trays
of
flowers
if
they
walked
farther
down
the
street
i
want
to
buy
some
from
jessie
he
sighed
and
from
gerda
i
do
like
gerda
the
best
of
anybody
he
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
gerda
laughed
miss
herbert
he
often
talks
about
her
and
really
she
very
kind
she
gives
him
so
many
picture
post
cards
the
sort
he
loves
with
photographs
of
animals
on
them
i
think
she
must
get
them
from
germany
i
never
seen
any
like
them
in
england
gerda
ripping
remarked
ronnie
as
he
trotted
away
deirdre
looked
after
him
in
much
astonishment
she
remembered
how
on
the
occasion
of
ronnie
birthday
gerda
had
paid
him
a
surreptitious
visit
and
given
him
a
present
on
her
own
account
but
she
had
no
idea
that
the
friendship
had
been
continued
gerda
must
surely
have
seen
him
on
other
occasions
and
won
his
favour
ronnie
was
so
entirely
the
king
of
the
castle
to
the
school
at
the
dower
house
that
deirdre
felt
hugely
indignant
at
the
notion
of
her
stealing
a
march
on
his
affections
it
was
an
extraordinary
thing
she
reflected
that
ronnie
should
care
for
anybody
so
silent
and
uninteresting
then
a
mental
vision
returned
to
her
of
gerda
eager
animated
face
as
she
had
seen
it
when
she
had
peeped
unobserved
over
the
wall
no
gerda
had
not
looked
silent
and
uninterested
when
she
was
alone
with
ronnie
the
girl
a
riddle
i
can
make
nothing
of
her
decided
deirdre
by
eleven
the
enthusiastic
flower
vendors
had
the
extreme
satisfaction
of
finding
their
trays
cleared
and
their
miniature
grown
extremely
heavy
they
carried
the
latter
to
the
public
hall
and
delivered
them
safely
to
the
secretary
of
the
fund
then
being
off
duty
they
wended
their
way
to
the
quay
to
await
that
function
the
launching
of
the
new
quite
a
crowd
was
assembled
of
both
visitors
and
townspeople
and
the
place
for
once
seemed
full
almost
to
overflowing
a
long
jetty
stretched
out
from
the
harbour
and
here
during
the
summer
months
large
numbers
of
lasses
were
busy
every
day
packing
fish
into
barrels
and
boxes
they
were
a
bonny
picturesque
crew
most
of
them
wearing
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
heads
and
short
sleeves
which
showed
their
arms
to
advantage
they
were
brought
to
cornwall
for
the
summer
from
scotland
in
a
special
vessel
chartered
for
the
purpose
and
performed
their
task
of
fish
packing
with
a
skill
and
dispatch
in
which
nobody
could
rival
them
for
the
moment
they
had
ceased
work
and
wiping
the
scales
from
their
hands
stood
watching
the
preparations
with
as
keen
interest
as
anybody
they
talking
gaelic
to
each
other
exclaimed
ronnie
running
up
to
deirdre
in
great
excitement
oh
it
sounds
so
funny
miss
herbert
says
it
rather
like
welsh
i
asked
one
of
them
to
say
something
and
she
just
gabbled
gibberish
and
said
it
meant
i
was
a
sweet
nice
little
boy
she
let
me
stand
on
a
barrel
and
i
could
see
so
well
but
miss
herbert
made
me
get
down
because
she
said
it
was
too
fishy
come
and
stand
here
with
me
suggested
deirdre
persuasively
no
i
going
to
gerda
she
over
there
and
smiling
at
me
and
ronnie
rushed
away
tumultuously
to
join
his
latest
favourite
placing
himself
so
extremely
near
to
the
edge
of
the
quay
as
to
have
involved
imminent
danger
had
not
gerda
held
one
of
his
small
hands
and
miss
herbert
the
other
as
everybody
seemed
to
be
collected
and
the
appointed
hour
of
noon
was
already
past
a
flag
was
waved
as
a
signal
for
the
proceedings
to
begin
first
a
blank
charge
was
fired
which
rang
over
the
water
with
a
tremendous
report
scaring
those
who
were
not
quite
prepared
for
it
and
making
some
people
clap
their
hands
over
their
ears
then
the
great
doors
of
the
national
station
swung
open
and
the
beautiful
new
came
gliding
gently
out
on
her
path
to
the
sea
all
her
crew
were
in
new
jerseys
and
scarlet
caps
and
as
the
bow
of
their
vessel
first
touched
the
water
they
broke
into
a
mighty
ringing
cheer
it
was
taken
up
by
the
crowd
and
from
every
side
came
hurrahs
and
shouts
of
congratulation
ronnie
was
flourishing
his
hat
frantically
with
miss
herbert
and
gerda
both
clutching
him
in
the
rear
and
hurrahing
with
all
the
power
of
his
young
lungs
the
fish
packers
were
clapping
and
waving
handkerchiefs
and
even
the
frightened
probably
by
the
gun
screamed
as
if
adding
their
quota
to
the
general
disturbance
i
do
like
anything
that
makes
a
noise
declared
ronnie
when
the
excitement
had
calmed
down
a
little
and
everyone
was
tired
of
shouting
i
going
to
ask
auntie
to
let
me
fire
the
two
old
cannon
on
the
terrace
at
home
when
i
go
back
i
quite
sure
she
wo
laughed
miss
herbert
the
made
a
short
trial
trip
round
the
harbour
then
returning
to
the
quay
the
coxswain
announced
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
take
visitors
on
board
in
relays
and
gave
a
special
first
invitation
to
the
young
ladies
who
had
so
kindly
sold
flowers
in
the
interest
of
the
institution
with
miss
birks
permission
the
delighted
girls
descended
the
stone
steps
and
were
jumped
by
sturdy
sailors
into
the
boat
ronnie
begged
so
hard
to
be
of
the
party
that
his
pretty
wistful
little
face
gained
the
day
and
the
coxswain
himself
took
him
in
his
arms
and
handed
him
safely
on
board
very
proud
he
was
of
his
trip
and
very
loath
to
go
back
to
dry
land
when
the
vessel
after
a
partial
tour
of
the
harbour
returned
to
take
a
fresh
cargo
of
young
people
when
those
of
the
juveniles
among
the
crowd
who
cared
to
venture
had
had
their
turn
the
crew
provided
a
fresh
sensation
by
giving
an
exhibition
of
one
of
their
number
jumped
into
the
water
and
throwing
up
his
hands
shouted
as
if
in
the
utmost
jeopardy
of
his
life
immediately
the
boat
was
turned
a
rope
flung
and
in
record
time
he
was
rescued
hauled
on
board
and
revived
the
rocket
apparatus
was
next
fixed
and
the
crowd
watched
with
deepest
interest
as
a
rope
was
fired
over
the
vessel
and
skilfully
caught
and
attached
by
the
crew
who
then
drew
up
the
cradle
a
rough
canvas
bag
in
which
the
passage
from
the
to
the
shore
must
be
made
without
wasting
a
moment
one
of
the
men
was
popped
in
then
those
on
shore
hauled
him
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
land
he
kept
dipping
in
the
water
as
he
came
so
the
girls
decided
that
in
a
real
storm
it
must
be
an
extremely
perilous
passage
and
he
would
be
likely
to
arrive
i
do
think
i
ever
dare
to
be
saved
in
a
dreadful
thing
like
that
shuddered
dulcie
i
rather
stay
on
board
and
take
my
chance
i
wish
they
let
me
go
in
it
said
ronnie
are
they
going
to
take
visitors
as
passengers
i
going
to
run
down
the
steps
and
ask
them
to
have
me
first
no
you
not
laughed
miss
herbert
you
getting
too
obstreperous
young
man
and
i
must
take
you
home
say
to
the
girls
oh
has
it
been
glorious
i
have
so
enjoyed
myself
when
will
the
next
fun
be
not
till
empire
day
then
we
have
the
beacon
fire
on
the
headland
oh
lovely
i
wish
it
was
what
gerda
as
his
friend
bent
over
him
and
murmured
something
really
oh
how
spiffing
rather
what
was
gerda
whispering
to
you
asked
deirdre
jealously
sha
tell
you
it
a
secret
between
her
and
me
chirruped
ronnie
as
he
danced
away
chapter
xiv
the
beacon
fire
the
girls
at
the
dower
house
were
extremely
keen
upon
celebrating
with
due
ceremony
every
festival
that
was
marked
in
the
calendar
they
bobbed
for
apples
on
eve
made
toffee
and
let
off
fireworks
on
november
tried
to
revive
valentine
fete
on
february
practised
the
usual
jokes
on
april
and
plaited
garlands
of
flowers
on
may
day
they
had
thoroughly
enjoyed
monday
and
now
turned
their
attention
to
providing
adequate
rejoicings
on
empire
day
all
through
the
winter
they
had
been
collecting
on
the
beach
and
carrying
it
to
the
headland
to
form
the
huge
bonfire
which
they
intended
should
be
a
beacon
for
the
neighbourhood
they
had
built
up
their
pile
with
skill
and
science
and
thanks
to
their
heroic
exertions
it
had
reached
quite
large
and
important
proportions
a
kindly
wind
had
dried
the
wood
so
that
there
was
every
prospect
of
its
burning
well
and
trevellyan
had
promised
a
large
can
of
paraffin
to
be
poured
on
at
the
last
moment
before
lighting
so
as
to
ensure
a
blaze
the
only
flaw
in
the
arrangement
was
the
fact
that
the
sun
did
not
set
until
past
eight
and
that
owing
to
the
long
twilight
it
would
probably
not
be
really
dark
until
ten
so
that
the
effect
of
their
beacon
would
be
slightly
marred
if
we
could
have
had
it
at
midnight
sighed
annie
pridwell
yes
that
would
have
been
scrumptious
if
we
could
have
got
people
to
come
ronnie
would
have
been
allowed
no
trevellyan
making
a
great
concession
as
it
is
to
let
him
stop
up
till
nine
it
a
pity
she
laid
up
with
sciatica
and
come
herself
she
watch
it
from
a
window
and
miss
herbert
will
bring
ronnie
trevellyan
had
been
extremely
kind
in
the
matter
of
the
bonfire
she
had
given
miss
birks
carte
blanche
in
respect
to
it
and
told
her
to
regard
the
headland
as
her
private
property
for
the
evening
and
ask
any
guests
whom
she
wished
to
join
in
the
celebration
quite
a
number
of
invitations
had
been
sent
out
to
various
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
a
merry
gathering
was
expected
some
were
to
arrive
at
the
school
and
walk
over
the
warren
and
others
had
decided
to
come
by
boat
to
the
little
cove
directly
under
the
headland
an
easier
means
of
getting
from
porthmorvan
or
gonstan
than
going
round
by
road
naturally
the
girls
were
all
at
the
very
tiptop
of
expectation
even
the
dignified
sixth
betrayed
signs
of
excitement
and
vb
was
in
a
state
verging
on
the
riotous
to
their
credit
they
all
accomplished
their
shortened
evening
preparation
with
exemplary
quiet
and
diligence
but
once
released
and
speeding
over
the
warren
to
the
headland
they
allowed
their
overwrought
spirits
to
find
relief
they
danced
ragtimes
sang
halloed
and
cooeed
and
generally
worked
off
steam
so
that
by
the
time
they
reached
the
beacon
they
had
calmed
down
sufficiently
to
satisfy
miss
birks
standard
of
holiday
behaviour
and
not
make
an
exhibition
of
themselves
before
visitors
already
people
were
beginning
to
arrive
both
by
land
and
sea
miss
birks
brought
a
select
party
who
had
motored
from
kergoff
and
at
least
half
a
dozen
boats
were
beached
upon
the
little
cove
ronnie
was
already
on
the
scene
in
charge
of
miss
herbert
immensely
proud
of
being
allowed
to
sit
up
beyond
his
usual
bedtime
and
running
here
there
and
everywhere
in
the
exuberance
of
his
supreme
satisfaction
the
girls
had
fixed
a
stake
into
the
rocks
close
by
from
which
a
union
jack
floated
to
give
the
of
the
proceedings
and
had
prepared
buttonholes
of
daisies
the
empire
flower
to
present
to
all
the
guests
they
had
twisted
round
their
own
hats
and
even
decorated
their
flagstaff
with
a
long
garland
so
they
felt
that
they
had
done
everything
possible
to
manifest
their
loyalty
to
king
george
trevellyan
head
gardener
had
brought
the
large
can
of
paraffin
and
filling
a
greenhouse
syringe
from
it
began
carefully
to
spray
the
wood
especially
in
the
places
where
it
was
most
important
for
the
fire
to
catch
the
company
then
drew
back
and
formed
a
circle
at
a
safe
and
respectful
distance
a
thin
train
of
gunpowder
was
laid
down
and
under
the
gardener
careful
superintendence
ronnie
was
allowed
the
immense
privilege
of
applying
a
taper
to
the
end
the
light
flared
up
and
wound
like
a
fiery
snake
to
the
beacon
where
catching
a
piece
of
gorse
soaked
with
paraffin
it
started
the
whole
pile
into
a
glorious
blaze
up
and
up
soared
the
flames
roaring
and
crackling
and
making
as
much
ado
as
if
the
spanish
armada
had
been
sighted
again
and
it
were
warning
the
neighbourhood
to
arms
the
girls
could
not
help
starting
three
cheers
the
guests
joined
lustily
and
ronnie
almost
beside
himself
with
excitement
pranced
about
like
a
small
officiating
at
some
heathen
ceremonial
rite
miss
birks
had
added
a
delightful
feature
to
the
celebration
by
providing
a
picnic
supper
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
hang
kettles
on
the
beacon
but
the
large
cauldron
had
been
brought
and
was
soon
at
work
boiling
water
to
make
coffee
and
cocoa
the
girls
helped
to
unpack
hampers
of
cups
and
saucers
and
to
arrange
baskets
of
cakes
and
when
the
bonfire
had
formed
a
sufficient
deposit
of
hot
ashes
rows
of
potatoes
were
placed
round
it
to
cook
and
to
be
eaten
later
it
was
a
very
merry
supper
as
they
sat
on
the
short
grass
of
the
headland
with
the
beacon
blazing
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
western
sky
all
glorious
with
the
copper
afterglow
of
sunset
the
new
moon
like
a
good
omen
shone
over
the
sea
and
from
far
far
away
came
the
distant
chime
of
bells
stealing
almost
like
elfin
music
over
the
water
from
the
beach
below
came
the
monotonous
cry
of
a
curlew
the
fairies
are
calling
whispered
gerda
to
ronnie
listen
this
is
just
the
time
for
their
dancing
the
new
moon
and
the
sunset
they
be
whirling
round
and
round
and
round
in
the
creek
over
there
really
oh
gerda
could
we
truly
truly
see
them
the
little
fellow
blue
eyes
were
wide
with
eagerness
he
sprang
on
his
friend
knee
and
clutched
her
tightly
round
the
neck
you
promised
you
take
me
he
breathed
in
her
ear
yes
if
you
very
quiet
and
do
tell
not
a
living
soul
must
know
but
you
and
me
if
anyone
else
sees
us
the
fairies
will
all
just
vanish
away
they
ca
bear
mortals
to
know
their
secrets
but
they
let
you
and
me
yes
you
shall
see
the
queen
of
the
fairies
and
she
give
you
a
kiss
oh
do
let
us
go
quick
in
a
moment
remember
nobody
must
notice
let
us
walk
over
there
and
pretend
we
looking
at
the
flag
now
come
gently
round
this
rock
hush
we
must
steal
away
if
we
to
find
fairies
i
believe
we
out
of
sight
now
not
a
soul
can
see
us
give
me
your
hand
darling
and
we
run
it
was
perhaps
a
few
minutes
after
this
that
miss
herbert
who
had
been
engaged
in
a
pleasant
conversation
with
the
curate
from
kergoff
missed
her
small
charge
where
ronnie
she
asked
anxiously
i
saw
him
just
now
said
miss
harding
he
was
with
the
girls
as
usual
gerda
thorwaldson
had
him
in
tow
if
he
with
gerda
he
all
right
returned
miss
herbert
evidently
relieved
she
always
so
very
careful
no
doubt
they
turn
up
directly
i
expect
they
only
fetching
more
potatoes
from
the
hamper
said
the
curate
we
soon
hunt
them
up
if
they
do
put
in
an
appearance
deirdre
who
was
standing
near
chanced
to
overhear
these
remarks
and
jealous
of
gerda
hold
over
ronnie
turned
in
search
of
the
missing
pair
they
were
not
by
the
bonfire
it
was
certain
nor
were
they
among
any
of
the
groups
of
girls
and
guests
who
still
sat
finishing
cups
of
coffee
and
laughing
and
chatting
deirdre
walked
to
where
the
hamper
of
potatoes
had
been
left
but
her
quest
was
still
unrewarded
she
returned
hastily
and
calling
her
chum
drew
her
aside
gerda
and
ronnie
have
disappeared
she
explained
briefly
i
like
the
look
of
it
gerda
has
no
right
to
monopolize
him
as
she
does
i
vote
we
go
straight
and
find
them
and
bring
them
back
the
two
girls
set
out
at
once
and
as
luck
would
have
it
turned
their
steps
exactly
in
the
direction
where
the
truants
had
gone
they
ran
down
the
steep
hillside
behind
the
flagstaff
till
they
reached
a
broad
terrace
on
the
verge
of
the
cliff
overhanging
the
cove
where
the
boats
were
moored
ronnie
was
so
fond
of
boats
that
they
thought
he
had
perhaps
persuaded
gerda
to
take
him
to
the
beach
to
look
at
them
advancing
as
near
to
the
edge
as
they
dared
they
peeped
over
on
to
the
sands
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
only
the
row
of
small
craft
lying
on
the
shingle
just
as
they
had
seen
them
an
hour
ago
the
tide
had
risen
higher
and
had
begun
to
lap
softly
against
them
but
was
not
yet
sufficiently
full
to
float
them
moreover
they
were
all
secured
with
stout
cables
stop
there
was
something
different
surely
there
had
only
been
six
boats
before
and
now
there
was
a
seventh
added
to
the
number
a
seventh
in
whose
shadow
lurked
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
suddenly
from
the
beach
below
rang
out
ronnie
clear
rippling
laugh
followed
by
an
instant
warning
sh
sh
and
immediately
he
and
gerda
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
on
to
the
shingle
they
ran
hand
in
hand
towards
the
seventh
boat
and
the
boatman
without
waiting
a
moment
jumped
them
in
one
after
the
other
pushed
off
sprang
into
his
seat
and
began
to
row
rapidly
away
across
the
creek
look
look
gasped
deirdre
in
an
agony
of
horror
it
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
of
his
identity
they
were
certain
even
in
the
failing
light
they
could
not
be
mistaken
and
he
was
kidnapping
ronnie
under
the
very
eyes
of
his
friends
ronnie
the
king
of
the
castle
the
idol
of
the
school
and
the
one
treasure
of
trevellyan
old
age
where
were
they
taking
him
was
he
to
be
held
for
ransom
or
kept
in
prison
somewhere
as
a
hostage
gerda
with
her
smooth
insinuating
ways
had
betrayed
him
and
led
him
away
to
his
fate
we
must
save
him
gasped
deirdre
save
him
before
it
is
too
late
quick
quick
let
us
run
down
to
the
shore
we
must
let
them
get
out
of
our
sight
the
two
girls
tore
frantically
down
the
path
which
led
to
the
sea
in
such
haste
that
they
had
not
time
to
realize
their
own
risk
of
slipping
that
ronnie
was
being
kidnapped
was
the
one
idea
of
paramount
importance
as
they
reached
the
belt
of
shingle
the
dinghy
had
already
crossed
the
creek
and
was
heading
round
the
corner
of
the
cliffs
to
the
west
what
can
we
do
moaned
dulcie
wringing
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
despair
shall
we
go
and
call
miss
birks
and
get
somebody
to
follow
them
with
a
boat
by
the
time
we
fetched
anybody
they
be
hopelessly
out
of
sight
and
gone
goodness
knows
where
no
if
ronnie
to
be
saved
we
must
act
at
once
and
follow
them
ourselves
you
can
row
ca
you
yes
i
learnt
last
holidays
at
home
on
the
river
so
can
i
then
come
let
choose
the
lightest
boat
we
can
find
we
must
waste
a
minute
we
both
strong
and
ought
to
be
able
to
manage
after
a
hasty
review
they
selected
a
small
skiff
as
looking
the
most
likely
to
respond
to
amateur
seamanship
and
loosing
the
cable
which
had
been
secured
round
a
rock
coiled
it
and
placed
it
inside
the
tide
had
risen
so
fast
that
it
did
not
require
any
very
great
effort
to
push
off
the
boat
are
you
ready
said
deirdre
do
mind
getting
your
feet
wet
it
ca
be
helped
now
then
heave
oh
she
off
with
a
simultaneous
splash
the
two
girls
scrambled
on
board
in
the
very
nick
of
time
and
taking
their
places
gingerly
unshipped
the
oars
they
were
neither
of
them
skilled
for
their
task
and
both
realized
that
it
was
rather
a
wild
and
risky
proceeding
for
ronnie
sake
however
they
would
have
ventured
far
more
so
they
mutually
hid
their
feelings
and
pretended
it
was
quite
an
everyday
easy
kind
of
performance
if
they
had
not
much
experience
their
zeal
and
their
strong
young
arms
made
the
light
little
skiff
fly
like
a
and
they
had
soon
gained
the
headland
round
which
the
other
boat
had
disappeared
very
cautiously
they
proceeded
for
fear
of
currents
but
they
managed
successfully
to
pilot
their
craft
past
a
group
of
rocks
and
take
her
round
the
corner
into
the
next
bay
in
front
through
the
gathering
darkness
they
could
just
distinguish
the
object
of
their
pursuit
making
a
landing
upon
the
opposite
shore
they
could
hear
the
grating
of
the
keel
on
the
shingle
and
an
excited
exclamation
from
ronnie
they
strained
their
eyes
to
watch
what
was
happening
the
man
in
the
jersey
helped
gerda
to
land
then
taking
ronnie
on
his
back
strode
rapidly
away
with
him
gerda
walking
close
by
his
side
in
another
moment
they
had
disappeared
behind
a
group
of
rocks
if
the
girls
rowed
fast
before
they
now
redoubled
their
efforts
both
were
flushed
and
panting
but
they
struggled
valiantly
on
and
succeeded
in
beaching
their
skiff
within
a
few
yards
of
the
white
dinghy
they
did
not
wait
to
cable
her
but
anxious
not
to
lose
a
moment
of
valuable
time
made
off
in
quest
of
the
fugitives
at
the
other
side
of
the
group
of
rocks
it
was
lighter
for
they
faced
the
west
and
caught
the
last
departing
glories
of
the
sunset
on
the
sands
bathed
in
the
golden
dying
gleam
of
the
afterglow
a
lady
was
kneeling
and
clasping
little
ronnie
tightly
in
her
arms
even
from
the
distance
where
they
stood
the
chums
could
see
how
very
fair
and
pretty
she
was
her
hat
had
fallen
on
the
beach
and
her
flaxen
head
was
pressed
closely
against
the
child
short
curls
why
she
actually
kissing
him
exclaimed
dulcie
the
scene
was
so
utterly
unanticipated
and
so
entirely
different
from
what
they
had
expected
to
find
that
the
two
girls
stood
for
a
moment
almost
at
a
loss
at
that
instant
gerda
spied
them
and
turning
to
her
companions
made
some
remark
in
a
low
tone
the
lady
immediately
loosed
ronnie
and
rose
to
her
feet
seeing
their
presence
was
discovered
the
chums
judged
it
best
to
walk
boldly
forward
they
had
come
to
rescue
ronnie
and
it
seemed
high
time
to
interfere
miss
herbert
looking
for
you
you
must
go
back
with
us
at
once
said
dulcie
laying
an
appropriating
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
and
glaring
defiance
at
his
kidnappers
gerda
had
blushed
crimson
she
looked
egregiously
caught
she
glanced
at
the
faces
of
her
fellow
conspirators
as
if
seeking
advice
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
nodded
yes
we
go
back
at
once
she
stammered
i
i
was
only
trying
to
give
ronnie
some
fun
miss
herbert
does
think
it
fun
said
dulcie
grimly
you
no
business
to
take
him
away
the
chums
each
seized
the
little
boy
by
a
hand
and
began
to
hurry
him
along
towards
the
boats
but
where
are
the
fairies
gerda
promised
i
should
see
the
fairies
he
objected
the
fairies
ca
dance
now
dear
replied
gerda
sadly
you
remember
i
said
they
could
only
come
if
nobody
was
watching
in
silence
the
whole
party
returned
to
the
shingle
bank
deirdre
and
dulcie
were
too
indignant
for
words
and
gerda
seemed
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
the
lady
was
crying
quietly
still
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
ronnie
the
chums
approached
their
skiff
then
for
the
first
time
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
spoke
you
better
all
come
into
my
boat
he
remarked
briefly
i
fasten
yours
on
to
the
stern
and
tow
her
along
the
chums
started
with
surprise
instead
of
the
local
dialect
of
a
fisherman
or
as
they
expected
the
foreign
accent
of
a
german
he
had
the
cultured
refined
tone
of
an
english
gentleman
for
a
moment
they
hesitated
did
he
mean
to
kidnap
them
as
well
as
ronnie
perhaps
he
saw
the
doubt
in
their
eyes
you
need
be
afraid
i
take
you
straight
back
he
urged
glad
to
escape
the
risky
task
of
rowing
round
the
point
and
steering
clear
of
dangerous
currents
the
girls
consented
though
rather
under
protest
and
wondering
at
the
novelty
of
the
situation
which
had
made
them
the
pursuers
return
in
charge
of
the
stranger
whom
they
still
distrusted
they
sat
in
the
stern
with
ronnie
between
them
guarding
him
like
two
faithful
bulldogs
the
lady
stood
upon
the
shore
watching
them
as
the
boat
pushed
off
there
was
a
sad
wistful
look
in
her
eyes
she
did
not
attempt
to
say
the
chums
felt
considerably
relieved
when
at
last
they
arrived
at
the
cove
again
in
safety
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
helped
them
all
to
land
without
a
word
then
he
unloosed
the
skiff
beached
her
on
the
shingle
whence
she
had
been
taken
and
rowed
out
alone
into
the
bay
ronnie
was
growing
sleepy
it
took
all
deirdre
and
dulcie
efforts
to
help
him
up
the
steep
cliffside
gerda
followed
a
short
way
behind
miss
herbert
who
had
really
been
uneasy
about
her
charge
hailed
their
arrival
with
relief
here
you
are
at
last
where
have
you
been
ronnie
to
see
fairies
gerda
must
tell
you
such
nonsense
wake
up
we
must
be
going
home
at
once
it
after
nine
the
bonfire
had
burnt
low
and
the
girls
were
packing
the
cups
into
baskets
ready
to
be
carried
to
the
dower
house
we
ought
to
tell
miss
birks
about
this
whispered
dulcie
and
deirdre
agreed
with
her
late
as
it
was
when
they
got
in
the
two
girls
sought
the
principal
in
her
study
and
poured
out
the
whole
of
the
story
their
alarm
on
behalf
their
dread
of
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
and
their
suspicion
that
gerda
was
a
german
spy
plotting
against
the
country
miss
birks
listened
most
attentively
putting
in
a
question
here
and
there
i
do
think
either
england
or
ronnie
is
in
any
immediate
danger
she
said
you
may
make
your
minds
easy
on
that
respect
i
shall
have
a
word
with
gerda
presently
you
have
done
right
to
tell
me
but
now
you
may
leave
the
whole
matter
safely
in
my
hands
and
need
not
worry
yourselves
any
more
over
it
on
no
account
talk
about
it
to
anybody
in
the
school
and
unless
gerda
refers
to
it
herself
do
not
mention
the
subject
to
her
trust
gerda
not
to
speak
of
it
said
dulcie
as
they
went
upstairs
the
sphinx
is
likely
to
offer
to
unravel
the
mystery
it
a
puzzle
i
ca
fit
together
replied
deirdre
it
all
in
odd
pieces
why
was
that
lady
crying
and
what
have
she
and
the
man
in
the
brown
jersey
got
to
do
with
ronnie
chapter
xv
the
old
windlass
by
this
time
the
reader
will
probably
have
gathered
that
master
ronald
trevellyan
though
possessed
of
a
very
charming
and
winsome
personality
had
a
decidedly
strong
will
of
his
own
on
the
whole
he
was
fairly
good
but
the
lack
of
companions
of
his
own
age
and
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
darling
of
the
household
made
it
almost
an
impossibility
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
in
some
slight
degree
spoilt
trevellyan
did
her
best
to
enforce
obedience
but
though
her
word
was
law
ronnie
was
not
always
so
ready
to
accept
the
authority
of
others
and
occasionally
exhibited
a
burst
of
independence
this
was
particularly
noticeable
with
his
governess
miss
herbert
was
inclined
to
be
and
was
not
sufficiently
firm
with
him
and
the
young
scamp
finding
he
could
get
his
own
way
took
advantage
of
her
failing
and
sometimes
defied
her
with
impunity
the
little
fellow
simple
lessons
were
over
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
he
either
played
in
the
garden
or
was
taken
for
a
walk
to
him
it
was
a
great
occasion
if
he
chanced
to
meet
the
pupils
from
the
dower
house
he
counted
them
all
as
friends
and
though
he
had
his
particular
favourites
among
them
he
was
quite
ready
to
be
the
general
pet
of
the
school
on
the
day
but
one
after
the
bonfire
when
on
his
way
to
the
beach
escorted
by
miss
herbert
he
encountered
the
twenty
girls
walking
with
miss
harding
towards
the
headland
hallo
ronnie
boy
where
are
you
off
to
we
all
going
to
drill
on
the
green
and
do
ambulance
practice
wo
miss
herbert
let
you
come
and
watch
us
not
thanks
i
busy
i
got
to
go
fishing
returned
the
king
of
the
castle
proudly
displaying
a
small
shrimping
net
auntie
going
to
have
what
i
catch
fried
for
breakfast
hope
she
wo
starve
had
you
better
run
after
a
rabbit
and
catch
it
for
her
or
shoot
a
cock
sparrow
come
with
us
to
drill
and
we
make
you
a
colonel
of
the
regiment
or
we
practise
ambulance
work
and
bind
up
your
leg
and
carry
you
home
on
a
coat
you
no
idea
what
fun
it
would
be
but
ronnie
stuck
to
his
guns
he
had
come
out
with
the
intention
of
fishing
and
not
even
the
attractions
of
drill
and
ambulance
could
tempt
him
from
trying
his
new
shrimping
net
we
shall
expect
a
pilchard
apiece
declared
his
friends
as
they
gave
up
trying
to
cajole
him
and
went
on
their
way
you
wo
get
any
they
all
for
auntie
he
shouted
yes
they
are
even
if
i
catch
shoals
and
shoals
and
shoals
the
girls
laughed
talked
about
him
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
dismissed
him
from
their
minds
they
were
full
of
their
practice
for
the
afternoon
it
was
only
this
term
that
drill
and
ambulance
had
been
taken
up
at
the
school
so
they
were
still
in
the
first
heat
of
their
enthusiasm
on
this
occasion
too
miss
barlow
a
lady
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
been
largely
connected
with
the
girl
guide
movement
in
australia
had
promised
to
come
and
inspect
them
and
give
them
some
of
the
results
of
her
colonial
experience
a
strip
of
green
sward
not
far
from
the
scene
of
the
beacon
fire
made
an
excellent
parade
ground
and
here
they
drew
up
in
line
to
await
the
arrival
of
their
honorary
colonel
who
was
following
with
miss
birks
miss
barlow
proved
to
be
like
an
children
book
a
combination
of
amusement
and
instruction
she
had
extremely
jolly
pleasant
manners
and
a
fund
of
lively
remarks
making
everybody
laugh
heartily
as
she
went
her
round
of
inspection
i
glad
you
know
the
difference
between
left
and
right
she
said
i
told
that
country
recruits
for
the
army
find
such
a
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
the
two
that
their
sergeant
is
sometimes
obliged
to
make
them
tie
a
band
of
hay
round
one
leg
and
a
band
of
straw
round
the
other
then
instead
of
calling
out
right
left
right
he
says
straw
hay
straw
until
they
have
grown
accustomed
to
march
do
you
find
colonial
girls
much
quicker
than
english
asked
jessie
macpherson
they
are
more
resourceful
and
very
bright
in
suggesting
fresh
ideas
but
they
are
not
so
willing
to
submit
to
discipline
they
are
more
ready
to
copy
a
corps
of
roughriders
than
a
roman
cohort
no
doubt
it
is
owing
to
the
way
they
are
brought
up
very
few
of
them
spend
their
early
life
in
the
charge
of
nurses
and
governesses
from
babyhood
they
are
taught
to
take
care
of
themselves
to
be
prepared
for
emergencies
and
to
throw
up
whatever
they
may
have
in
hand
and
go
to
the
assistance
of
a
neighbour
who
needs
them
it
is
a
training
that
makes
them
helpful
and
energetic
but
perhaps
a
little
too
independent
to
accord
entirely
with
the
standards
we
keep
at
home
our
girls
are
more
sheltered
and
guarded
and
it
is
only
natural
that
they
should
have
a
different
style
from
those
who
must
hold
their
own
i
wish
i
could
have
introduced
you
to
some
of
my
bright
young
australian
friends
i
think
you
would
find
the
same
charm
about
them
that
i
do
miss
barlow
had
many
hints
to
give
them
on
the
subject
of
camp
cookery
she
showed
the
girls
the
quickest
and
most
practical
way
to
build
a
fire
and
the
right
situation
to
choose
for
it
as
regards
shelter
i
wish
we
could
have
stayed
here
for
a
whole
day
and
prepared
our
own
dinner
she
said
it
is
wonderful
how
much
can
be
done
with
a
iron
pot
and
some
gorse
to
burn
under
it
we
would
have
made
a
most
delicious
stew
i
should
have
liked
to
teach
you
to
build
a
camp
oven
but
we
should
need
a
spade
for
that
one
has
to
dig
a
hole
nearly
a
yard
deep
and
wide
line
it
with
stones
light
a
fire
in
it
then
pop
one
iron
pot
on
to
the
mass
of
hot
ashes
and
cover
the
whole
with
a
roof
of
sticks
and
sods
i
have
often
baked
bread
this
way
out
in
the
bush
then
you
ought
to
know
how
to
wrap
up
your
food
in
cases
of
green
leaves
and
wet
clay
to
be
cooked
in
the
ashes
round
an
ordinary
camp
fire
and
how
to
mix
flour
and
water
cakes
when
there
is
no
yeast
to
be
had
for
bread
if
only
we
could
come
and
camp
out
with
you
here
for
a
week
sighed
the
girls
it
would
be
ripping
fun
yes
if
the
weather
were
fine
but
our
english
weather
is
apt
to
play
unkind
tricks
my
brother
is
a
doctor
and
medical
officer
to
a
brigade
at
whitsuntide
he
went
with
them
to
camp
it
was
delightful
for
the
first
three
days
then
in
the
night
a
perfect
blizzard
arose
and
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
the
wind
got
under
his
tent
and
tore
up
some
of
the
pegs
then
half
the
canvas
came
flapping
down
a
wet
mass
over
his
bed
a
tent
will
keep
out
the
weather
but
if
it
gets
loose
and
rests
against
anything
inside
the
rain
will
soak
through
and
you
can
imagine
the
miserable
condition
in
preparing
breakfast
all
the
boys
got
wretchedly
wet
and
to
try
to
prevent
their
taking
cold
my
brother
dosed
them
all
with
camphor
as
there
were
eighty
in
camp
you
can
understand
it
took
a
long
time
to
measure
out
the
orthodox
ten
drops
on
to
each
separate
lump
of
sugar
i
am
afraid
the
last
patient
had
full
opportunity
of
catching
the
cold
before
he
took
the
cure
i
expect
the
ancient
britons
did
camp
cookery
when
they
lived
here
suggested
irene
jordan
no
doubt
they
did
there
are
traces
that
a
most
early
and
primitive
people
far
older
than
the
celts
whom
julius
cæsar
wrote
about
must
have
lived
on
this
headland
we
are
sitting
on
the
very
remains
of
their
little
circular
huts
look
you
can
trace
the
outlines
of
the
ancient
stone
walls
here
a
small
community
must
have
lived
and
hunted
and
fished
and
fetched
limpets
and
periwinkles
from
the
beach
to
eat
as
dessert
probably
the
reindeer
or
the
irish
elk
still
came
to
feed
on
the
mossy
grass
and
there
would
be
a
grand
pursuit
with
bows
and
arrows
it
must
have
been
a
great
event
to
kill
an
elk
the
whole
primitive
village
would
feast
for
days
afterwards
toasting
the
flesh
on
little
spits
of
wood
then
the
women
would
prepare
the
skin
and
stitch
it
with
bone
needles
into
warm
garments
and
the
horns
would
be
used
as
picks
or
other
implements
so
that
nothing
was
wasted
their
camp
cookery
would
have
to
be
even
more
simple
than
ours
for
they
had
not
yet
discovered
the
use
of
metals
so
could
not
have
a
cauldron
they
boiled
their
water
in
a
very
curious
manner
by
dropping
stones
into
it
it
must
have
taken
a
long
time
and
given
rather
a
funny
flavour
to
the
joints
but
no
doubt
they
tasted
delicious
to
neolithic
appetites
i
like
to
restore
a
few
of
the
huts
and
come
and
live
in
them
for
a
few
days
and
pretend
we
were
primitive
folk
said
deirdre
trevellyan
has
often
talked
of
excavating
them
remarked
miss
birks
i
hope
she
will
do
so
it
is
quite
possible
that
some
very
interesting
relics
of
the
stone
age
might
be
turned
up
it
would
probably
fix
the
period
when
they
were
inhabited
how
long
ago
would
that
be
asked
one
of
the
girls
most
likely
about
two
thousand
years
or
more
the
conversation
at
this
point
was
interrupted
for
in
the
distance
appeared
miss
herbert
running
beckoning
and
calling
to
them
all
at
once
in
considerable
alarm
they
went
to
meet
her
where
ronnie
she
gasped
i
lost
him
oh
has
anybody
seen
him
is
he
here
with
you
he
certainly
not
here
said
miss
birks
we
not
seen
him
since
we
met
you
an
hour
or
more
ago
when
did
you
miss
him
and
where
on
the
beach
sobbed
miss
herbert
hysterically
he
was
playing
with
his
little
shrimping
net
i
sat
down
to
read
my
book
and
i
kept
looking
to
see
that
he
was
all
right
and
then
suddenly
he
had
disappeared
i
thought
he
must
have
trotted
back
round
the
point
so
i
followed
but
i
could
find
him
i
hoped
he
come
up
here
to
you
it
very
naughty
of
him
to
run
away
we
must
find
him
at
once
said
miss
birks
gravely
girls
you
had
better
go
in
parties
of
three
each
in
a
different
direction
miss
barlow
and
i
will
go
with
miss
herbert
we
wo
give
up
the
search
until
he
is
found
did
he
go
round
the
other
corner
of
the
cove
asked
gerda
he
could
the
waves
were
dashing
quite
high
against
the
rocks
sure
he
would
never
venture
declared
the
distracted
governess
he
such
a
plucky
little
chap
he
would
venture
anything
oh
surely
not
he
could
he
could
have
gone
there
he
may
have
run
home
better
not
waste
any
more
time
but
go
and
see
what
become
of
him
suggested
miss
birks
rather
dryly
she
had
always
thought
miss
herbert
too
where
ronnie
was
concerned
the
bands
of
searchers
set
off
in
eight
different
directions
shouting
hallooing
cuckooing
and
making
every
kind
of
call
likely
to
attract
the
child
attention
some
took
the
beach
and
some
the
cliffs
while
others
ran
to
the
castle
to
see
if
he
had
returned
to
the
garden
there
had
never
been
such
a
hue
and
cry
on
the
headland
that
ronnie
should
be
lost
was
an
unparalleled
disaster
and
considering
the
many
accidents
which
might
possibly
have
happened
to
him
each
of
his
friends
searched
with
a
deadly
fear
in
her
heart
gerda
her
once
rosy
face
white
as
chalk
had
flown
along
the
cliffs
with
deirdre
and
dulcie
shouting
his
name
again
and
again
he
may
have
gone
round
the
west
corner
though
miss
herbert
says
he
could
she
panted
let
us
get
on
to
the
cliff
above
where
we
can
look
down
oh
ronnie
ronnie
cuckoo
where
are
you
cooee
as
gerda
gave
the
last
call
she
stopped
suddenly
and
motioned
the
others
to
silence
from
the
shore
below
there
came
a
faint
but
quite
unmistakable
response
creeping
to
the
verge
of
the
overhanging
precipice
gerda
peeped
down
there
at
a
distance
of
forty
feet
beneath
stood
ronnie
a
pathetic
little
figure
turning
up
a
small
frightened
face
and
quavering
a
shrill
cooee
his
position
was
one
of
imminent
danger
the
point
round
which
he
had
scrambled
half
an
hour
before
was
now
covered
with
great
dashing
waves
that
hurled
their
spray
high
into
the
air
and
the
narrow
strip
of
shingle
upon
which
he
stood
was
rapidly
growing
smaller
and
smaller
as
the
tide
advanced
on
either
hand
escape
was
impossible
behind
him
roared
the
sea
and
in
front
towered
the
steep
unscalable
face
of
the
cliff
gerda
gerda
he
wailed
piteously
gerda
turned
to
her
companions
almost
like
an
animal
at
bay
her
lips
were
white
as
her
cheeks
her
eyes
blazed
we
must
save
him
she
choked
the
let
us
fetch
the
cried
deirdre
you
stay
here
and
i

of

me

fast
runner
cooee
cooee
ronnie
is
found
deirdre
was
very
swift
of
foot
and
darted
off
like
a
hare
shouting
her
message
to
the
nearest
band
of
searchers
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
news
had
spread
and
all
were
hurrying
towards
the
cliff
the
ill
tidings
reached
trevellyan
at
the
castle
and
sick
with
anxiety
she
hastened
to
the
spot
first
sending
one
of
her
men
to
urge
speed
in
launching
the
the
tide
was
sweeping
in
fast
and
nearer
and
nearer
crept
the
cruel
hungry
waves
as
if
thirsting
to
snatch
the
little
figure
huddled
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
ronnie
was
too
worn
out
and
too
frightened
to
call
now
he
lay
watching
the
advancing
water
with
blue
eyes
still
grasping
the
shrimping
net
that
had
led
him
to
this
disaster
could
the
possibly
arrive
in
time
that
was
the
question
which
each
spectator
asked
dumbly
not
daring
to
voice
it
in
words
nearer
and
ever
nearer
swept
the
waves
where
there
had
been
yards
of
shingle
there
were
only
feet
soon
it
was
a
matter
of
inches
there
was
not
a
sign
of
any
boat
to
be
seen
a
below
flapped
its
wings
like
an
omen
of
death
tom
and
smith
have
gone
to
fetch
ropes
breathed
miss
birks
and
her
voice
broke
the
strain
of
almost
intolerable
silence
there
not
time
to
wait
for
them
can
we
do
nothing
oh
is
there
no
way
to
save
him
then
gerda
stood
up
with
a
sudden
light
shining
in
her
clear
eyes
yes
yes
she
cried
there
the
old
windlass
i
going
down
to
him
by
that
years
ago
there
had
been
a
small
find
of
china
clay
on
the
headland
it
had
been
lowered
in
buckets
over
the
side
of
the
cliff
to
be
taken
away
by
boat
and
the
remains
of
the
apparatus
a
derelict
rickety
affair
stood
within
a
few
yards
of
the
place
where
the
watchers
were
gathered
a
rusty
bucket
was
still
attached
to
the
frayed
rope
twisted
round
the
roller
to
descend
by
so
frail
a
support
was
indeed
a
risk
so
great
that
only
the
most
desperate
necessity
could
justify
it
a
general
murmur
of
horror
arose
from
those
assembled
it
the
one
chance
i
going
to
try
it
repeated
gerda
you
can
lower
me
gently
by
the
handle
i
going
to
save
him
or
die
with
him
she
began
rapidly
to
unwind
the
windlass
so
as
to
allow
the
bucket
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
cliff
realizing
that
she
was
in
grim
earnest
the
others
offered
no
further
objection
and
came
eagerly
to
her
assistance
she
had
seized
the
rope
and
was
about
to
step
into
the
bucket
when
a
strong
hand
put
her
aside
the
stranger
in
the
brown
jersey
had
silently
joined
himself
to
the
group
this
is
my
place
he
said
firmly
i
am
going
down
the
cliff
hold
hard
there
pay
out
the
rope
gently
and
do
let
me
go
with
a
run
or
i
done
for
easy
easy
give
me
more
rope
when
i
call
so
quickly
did
he
substitute
himself
for
gerda
that
he
was
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
almost
before
anyone
had
realized
what
was
taking
place
the
onlookers
held
their
breath
as
they
watched
the
perilous
descent
the
bucket
swayed
from
side
to
side
and
bumped
against
the
rock
but
holding
on
to
the
rope
with
one
hand
the
man
managed
with
the
other
to
keep
himself
from
injury
down
down
down
he
swung
till
clear
of
the
cliff
he
dangled
as
it
seemed
in
now
rope
more
rope
he
called
quicker
the
windlass
creaked
on
the
rusty
axle
there
was
a
rush
a
drop
then
a
shout
of
triumph
the
next
moment
he
had
snatched
ronnie
in
his
arms
ringing
cheers
reached
him
from
above
but
the
battle
was
only
half
won
after
all
there
was
still
no
sign
of
the
a
wave
swept
already
over
his
feet
the
only
road
to
safety
lay
up
the
cliffside
would
the
old
rope
stand
the
double
strain
there
was
no
time
for
questioning
telling
ronnie
to
hold
on
tightly
round
his
neck
he
once
more
entered
the
bucket
and
gave
the
signal
for
the
ascent
to
the
anxious
hearts
of
the
watchers
the
next
few
minutes
seemed
an
eternity
those
at
the
windlass
turned
the
handle
slowly
and
steadily
in
response
to
the
shouts
from
below
if
there
had
been
danger
before
the
peril
now
was
trebled
with
a
child
clinging
round
his
neck
it
was
far
more
difficult
for
the
stranger
to
keep
clear
of
the
rock
the
old
machine
creaked
and
groaned
like
one
in
mortal
agony
life
or
death
hung
on
the
strength
of
a
rusted
piece
of
chain
and
a
hempen
rope
up
up
up
would
the
suspense
never
end
only
a
few
yards
now
and
the
watchers
were
waiting
to
help
once
more
the
rickety
axle
creaked
and
shivered
then
the
stranger
head
and
shoulders
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
eager
hands
grasped
him
and
pulled
him
gently
forward
on
to
firm
ground
he
had
lost
his
hat
in
the
descent
and
now
the
sunlight
fell
full
on
his
features
and
his
fair
hair
you
you
you
shrieked
trevellyan
wildly
but
for
answer
he
placed
ronnie
in
her
arms
and
pushing
his
way
through
the
excited
group
ran
off
over
the
warren
and
was
out
of
sight
before
the
had
recovered
from
their
amazement
by
the
time
the
had
made
its
way
round
the
coast
from
pontperran
harbour
great
breakers
were
crashing
against
the
face
of
the
rock
with
a
dull
booming
and
showers
of
foam
as
if
angry
to
have
been
cheated
of
their
prey
no
one
could
live
for
a
moment
in
this
cruel
sea
exclaimed
deirdre
shuddering
with
horror
as
she
thought
how
the
fierce
water
would
have
dashed
and
tossed
and
crushed
the
little
helpless
figure
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
waves
ronnie
will
be
doubly
dear
to
us
now
said
miss
birks
marshalling
her
girls
together
and
turning
to
leave

chapter
xvi
hare
and
hounds
after
the
intense
excitement
of
ronnie
peril
and
subsequent
rescue
his
friends
at
the
dower
house
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
settle
down
into
ordinary
school
routine
they
could
discuss
no
other
topic
and
many
were
their
speculations
concerning
the
stranger
who
had
appeared
in
the
very
nick
of
time
and
vanished
afterwards
without
waiting
to
be
thanked
his
identity
had
not
been
disclosed
and
when
the
girls
spoke
of
him
miss
birks
rather
to
their
surprise
dismissed
the
subject
hurriedly
if
he
does
not
wish
his
brave
deed
to
be
acknowledged
we
must
respect
his
silence
she
said
it
is
useless
and
futile
to
go
further
into
the
matter
trevellyan
was
for
a
few
days
prostrated
from
the
effects
of
that
of
suspense
but
she
had
sufficiently
recovered
to
attend
church
on
sunday
and
holding
ronnie
little
hand
tightly
in
hers
knelt
in
the
old
castle
pew
with
bent
head
and
tears
raining
down
her
cheeks
as
the
clergyman
announced
that
a
member
of
the
congregation
desired
to
return
special
thanks
for
a
very
great
mercy
vouchsafed
to
her
during
the
past
week
others
besides
trevellyan
joined
with
gratitude
in
that
addition
to
the
general
thanksgiving
and
when
afterwards
the
lines
of
the
grand
old
hymn
rang
out
o
god
our
help
in
ages
past
our
hope
for
years
to
come
there
was
not
a
girl
in
the
dower
house
pews
who
did
not
sing
it
with
real
meaning
in
the
words
on
the
monday
trevellyan
hoping
to
recover
from
her
nervous
attack
more
easily
if
she
were
out
of
sight
of
the
sea
went
away
for
a
short
visit
to
an
inland
taking
ronnie
and
poor
contrite
miss
herbert
who
could
not
forgive
herself
for
having
allowed
her
young
charge
to
run
into
danger
appreciating
the
wisdom
of
the
step
and
realizing
that
her
own
girls
had
been
in
a
state
of
high
tension
and
were
suffering
from
the
consequent
reaction
miss
birks
granted
the
school
a
whole
holiday
and
took
votes
on
how
the
day
should
be
spent
opinions
seemed
divided
so
it
was
finally
decided
that
forms
vi
and
va
should
go
by
train
to
linsgarth
look
over
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
and
walk
home
by
road
while
vb
containing
the
younger
and
more
wildly
energetic
spirits
should
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
a
game
at
hare
and
hounds
it
was
years
since
a
paper
chase
had
been
held
at
the
school
and
while
the
elder
girls
affected
to
despise
it
the
younger
ones
had
plumped
for
it
in
a
body
they
felt
they
required
something
more
stirring
than
admiring
ruins
and
marching
along
a
high
road
it
may
be
very
cultured
and
good
taste
and
intellectual
and
all
the
rest
of
it
to
poke
round
with
miss
birks
among
norman
arches
and
broken
but
it
does
work
off
steam
confessed
evie
bennett
i
longing
for
a
good
sporting
run
and
that
the
fact
let
the
sixth
talk
architectural
jargon
if
they
like
hard
exercise
for
me
agreed
betty
scott
it
was
arranged
that
all
should
start
out
at
ten
miss
birks
conducting
the
expedition
to
linsgarth
and
miss
harding
assuming
command
of
the
paper
chase
while
mademoiselle
who
was
a
bad
walker
and
disliked
country
excursions
promised
herself
a
delightful
day
of
rest
and
leisure
in
the
garden
miss
birks
insisted
that
there
must
be
three
hares
all
solemnly
pledged
to
keep
well
together
and
the
remaining
six
who
were
to
be
hounds
had
orders
not
to
outstrip
miss
harding
to
the
extent
of
getting
hopelessly
out
of
eyeshot
and
earshot
fortunately
miss
harding
was
energetic
and
enthusiastic
and
promised
not
to
be
a
drag
on
the
proceedings
she
donned
her
shortest
skirt
and
her
coolest
jumper
and
discarding
a
hat
appeared
fully
ready
to
play
as
hearty
a
part
in
the
game
as
any
of
her
pupils
everybody
naturally
was
anxious
to
act
hare
so
it
was
decided
that
the
fairest
plan
was
to
draw
lots
for
the
coveted
posts
the
three
fortunate
papers
with
the
crosses
fell
to
deirdre
gerda
and
annie
pridwell
i
not
jealous
but
i
do
envy
you
dreadfully
confessed
evie
bennett
oh
i
not
grumbling
i
ready
to
take
my
sporting
luck
and
someone
must
draw
the
blanks
you
make
capital
hares
because
you
all
good
runners
and
do
lose
your
breath
quickly
but
i
beseech
you
do
go
too
fast
remember
the
hounds
are
tied
to
miss
harding
it
no
fun
if
we
ca
catch
a
glimpse
of
you
the
whole
run
and
please
do
a
little
work
cross
a
brook
or
double
round
a
wood
anything
to
make
it
more
difficult
to
find
the
scent
we
do
want
to
be
home
in
a
couple
of
hours
trust
us
to
be
as
cunning
as
foxes
declared
annie
pridwell
i
an
old
hand
at
the
game
we
play
it
in
the
holidays
at
home
i
have
annie
experience
but
i
can
run
said
deirdre
so
you
can
best
of
anyone
in
the
school
and
gerda
no
slacker
so
i
think
you
do
each
girl
had
a
packet
of
sandwiches
and
a
small
folding
so
that
they
could
take
some
refreshment
when
they
felt
hungry
miss
birks
had
arranged
that
a
cold
lunch
should
be
laid
in
the
at
the
dower
house
at
one
and
left
on
the
table
indefinitely
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
girls
when
they
came
in
whether
early
or
late
and
those
who
returned
first
were
to
help
themselves
without
waiting
for
the
others
we
shall
all
feel
far
more
at
liberty
with
this
plan
she
said
it
spoils
everyone
pleasure
to
have
to
hurry
home
by
a
certain
time
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
to
think
we
have
the
day
free
to
do
as
we
like
we
can
have
tea
together
in
the
evening
and
compare
our
experiences
we
shall
have
seen
something
worth
seeing
declared
the
senior
girls
ah
but
you
wo
have
had
the
ripping
glorious
time
that
we
mean
to
have
retorted
the
members
of
vb
punctually
at
ten
the
three
hares
were
ready
each
with
a
satchel
round
her
shoulder
containing
the
scraps
of
torn
paper
that
were
to
provide
the
scent
they
were
to
have
ten
minutes
start
after
which
the
hounds
would
follow
in
full
cry
they
had
decided
among
themselves
what
route
to
take
and
determined
to
give
the
hunt
a
run
they
selected
the
direction
of
kergoff
and
set
off
towards
the
old
windmill
where
in
the
early
spring
they
had
surveyed
the
country
to
draw
maps
as
a
lesson
in
practical
geography
there
was
a
definite
reason
for
their
choice
as
the
windmill
could
be
approached
by
no
less
than
three
separate
paths
and
by
dodging
from
one
to
another
of
these
they
hoped
very
successfully
to
puzzle
their
pursuers
we
leave
some
scent
by
the
gate
of
perkins
farm
said
the
experienced
annie
then
of
course
they
think
we
chosen
the
road
past
the
quarry
but
we
only
go
a
little
way
up
the
lane
then
climb
the
wall
cross
the
fields
and
get
into
the
upper
road
leave
a
scent
there
then
track
through
the
wood
and
go
past
the
old
yew
tree
by
the
path
over
the
tor
there
be
a
scent
on
each
separate
path
chuckled
deirdre
be
a
good
long
time
in
finding
out
which
to
follow
we
must
be
careful
not
to
let
ourselves
be
seen
when
we
crossing
the
tor
there
was
a
delightful
interest
in
baffling
the
hounds
it
seemed
to
hold
almost
the
thrill
of
earlier
and
more
romantic
times
can
you
imagine
the
are
after
you
asked
deirdre
or
that
you
slain
the
red
king
or
robbed
an
abbot
in
the
greenwood
and
are
fleeing
for
your
life
to
take
sanctuary
in
the
nearest
church
no
i
a
smuggler
said
annie
trying
to
outwit
the
and
arrange
to
leave
my
kegs
of
brandy
and
packets
of
tea
and
yards
of
french
lace
in
some
cunning
what
are
you
gerda
an
escaped
prisoner
from
dartmoor
running
from
his
warders
queried
deirdre
that
would
be
sport
there
a
warrant
out
for
your
arrest
and
you
dodging
the
officers
of
the
law
laughed
annie
lightly
but
gerda
did
not
appear
to
accept
the
suggestions
kindly
or
in
the
spirit
of
fun
in
which
they
were
intended
to
the
girls
surprise
she
blushed
just
as
she
used
to
do
when
first
she
came
to
school
and
looked
so
clearly
annoyed
instead
of
amused
that
the
joke
fell
flat
she
was
never
at
any
time
talkative
but
now
taking
seeming
offence
at
these
very
innocent
remarks
she
drew
into
her
innermost
shell
and
refused
to
converse
at
all
knowing
her
of
old
in
this
uncommunicative
mood
the
others
did
not
trouble
further
but
left
her
to
her
own
devices
until
she
chose
to
come
out
of
it
they
had
found
by
experience
that
it
was
useless
either
to
question
her
laugh
at
her
or
rally
her
upon
her
silence
the
more
they
pressed
the
subject
the
more
obstinate
she
would
grow
it
was
no
great
hardship
to
miss
her
out
of
their
talk
they
much
preferred
each
other
company
without
an
unwelcome
third
those
that
sulk
for
nothing
may
sulk
so
far
as
i
concerned
remarked
deirdre
pointedly
i
hate
people
not
to
be
able
to
take
the
least
scrap
of
a
joke
said
annie
why
betty
and
evie
and
i
are
teasing
each
other
the
whole
time
in
our
bedroom
you
three
certainly
know
how
to
rag
rather
we
die
of
dullness
if
we
did
all
the
time
they
went
the
hares
were
carefully
carrying
out
their
policy
of
puzzling
those
who
followed
backwards
and
forwards
across
small
brooks
through
woods
and
thickets
over
field
and
common
they
laid
the
most
bewildering
of
scents
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
evie
bennett
and
sufficient
indeed
to
make
her
declare
it
almost
an
impossibility
to
decide
on
the
right
track
all
this
artful
dodging
however
had
necessitated
scattering
a
large
number
of
the
precious
handfuls
of
paper
and
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
old
windmill
they
found
to
their
consternation
that
the
contents
of
the
three
satchels
were
almost
exhausted
what
are
we
to
do
asked
annie
tragically
we
ca
go
on
and
leave
no
scents
are
we
to
sit
here
on
the
windmill
steps
and
let
ourselves
be
run
to
earth
when
we
only
done
half
the
round
it
was
a
crisis
indeed
and
deirdre
could
not
see
any
way
out
of
the
difficulty
she
stood
ruefully
contemplating
her
empty
bag
and
looking
utterly
baffled
it
was
gerda
after
all
who
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
valuable
suggestion
we
close
to
that
queer
old
house
she
said
do
you
remember
how
we
climbed
in
through
the
window
and
found
all
those
letters
lying
about
upstairs
they
ca
be
wanted
or
somebody
would
have
taken
them
away
let
go
and
see
if
they
still
there
and
commandeer
what
we
like
gerda
you
a
genius
shrieked
annie
we
go
this
second
why
it
the
very
thing
we
want
it
was
no
great
distance
to
the
old
house
down
the
corkscrew
road
they
ran
through
the
small
fir
wood
and
over
the
river
by
the
stone
bridge
forster
folly
looked
if
possible
even
more
tumbledown
and
dilapidated
than
when
they
had
visited
it
in
february
the
spring
gales
had
blown
down
many
more
slates
and
made
a
gap
in
the
roof
the
creepers
in
their
summer
luxuriance
almost
hid
the
broken
windows
large
patches
of
stucco
had
fallen
from
the
walls
a
lay
smashed
on
the
front
walk
one
of
the
props
of
the
long
veranda
had
been
swept
away
by
the
whirling
stream
leaving
the
flooring
in
a
dangerous
condition
and
the
crop
of
nettles
and
brambles
in
the
garden
had
outgrown
all
bounds
and
smothering
the
original
privet
hedge
overflowed
into
the
road
it
more
spooky
and
rat
and
moated
than
ever
declared
annie
i
could
imagine
there
been
a
witches
carnival
since
we
were
last
here
or
a
dance
of
ghouls
ugh
i
all
in
a
shiver
at
having
to
go
inside
suppose
we
find
the
ghost
after
all
i
chance
ghosts
said
deirdre
i
be
a
great
deal
more
frightened
to
find
a
tramp
there
oh
surely
even
a
tramp
would
spend
a
night
in
such
a
haunted
den
still
it
so
deserted
it
might
be
a
place
for
smugglers
or
coiners
or
burglars
oh
i
do
think
i
dare
go
in
after
all
no
i
dare
annie
was
and
looking
inclined
to
turn
tail
illustration
gerda
darted
upon
the
bathful
of
old
letters
do
show
the
white
feather
now
said
gerda
reproachfully
where
are
we
to
get
our
paper
from
come
along
annie
and
do
be
an
idiot
was
uncomplimentary
rejoinder
why
you
were
the
first
to
go
in
before
my
nerves
were
stronger
last
february
protested
annie
i
let
one
of
you
take
the
lead
this
time
it
was
quite
a
pilgrimage
through
the
garden
to
reach
the
window
where
they
had
made
their
entrance
into
the
house
it
was
open
just
as
they
had
left
it
but
long
trails
of
clematis
swept
across
and
there
was
an
empty
bird
nest
on
the
corner
of
the
sill
it
did
not
appear
as
if
anyone
had
disturbed
its
quiet
for
months
this
time
gerda
led
the
way
with
a
confidence
and
assurance
that
rather
surprised
the
other
two
through
the
dilapidated
along
the
dim
mouldy
hall
and
up
the
creaking
stairs
they
tramped
trying
by
the
noise
they
made
to
dispel
the
ghostly
feeling
that
clung
to
the
deserted
old
place
if
coiners
smugglers
or
burglars
had
visited
the
house
they
had
left
no
trace
of
their
presence
everything
on
the
story
above
was
untouched
though
perhaps
a
trifle
more
and
cobwebby
than
before
gerda
darted
upon
the
bathful
of
old
letters
and
with
eager
fingers
anxiously
began
turning
them
hurriedly
over
have
time
to
sort
them
out
declared
annie
snatching
up
a
handful
and
putting
them
into
her
bag
i
vote
we
take
what
we
want
and
tear
them
up
outside
why
are
you
looking
at
them
so
particularly
gerda
i
thought
some
might
have
crests
do
let
me
see
what
you
taken
said
gerda
beseechingly
no
i
do
want
these
why
you
never
looked
inside
the
envelopes
how
can
you
tell
whether
they
crests
oh
never
mind
it
does
matter
gerda
was
on
the
floor
searching
among
some
opened
and
torn
sheets
that
lay
on
the
mouldering
straw
look
here
we
ca
stay
all
day
while
you
read
old
correspondence
we
got
enough
come
along
one
minute
oh
do
wait
for
me
a
second
i
come
yes
i
come
in
half
a
jiffy
we
go
without
you
then
you
soon
trot
after
us
said
deirdre
who
had
filled
her
satchel
she
and
annie
clattered
downstairs
again
looked
into
the
empty
kitchen
and
dared
each
other
to
peep
into
the
dark
hall
cupboard
they
had
hardly
waited
more
than
a
minute
in
the
when
gerda
joined
them
well
have
you
found
the
orthodox
will
mocked
annie
i
got
enough
scent
to
take
us
back
to
pontperran
and
that
what
i
wanted
retorted
gerda
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
seemed
almost
more
than
the
occasion
justified
no
more
time
must
be
lost
if
they
did
not
want
to
be
run
to
earth
by
the
hounds
so
returning
to
the
windmill
steps
they
tore
up
their
fresh
supply
of
paper
taking
bites
of
their
sandwiches
while
they
did
so
a
loud
cuckoo
in
the
distance
caused
all
three
to
start
to
their
feet
in
alarm
and
leaving
a
trail
behind
the
broken
sail
they
scrambled
over
a
fence
and
dived
down
through
a
coppice
which
led
to
the
stream
they
followed
the
bank
for
some
distance
before
they
judged
it
safe
once
more
to
take
to
a
then
doubling
round
the
hill
on
which
the
windmill
stood
they
tacked
off
in
the
direction
of
kergoff
the
hounds
reached
the
dower
house
at
five
exactly
half
an
hour
after
the
hares
and
over
a
combined
discussed
the
run
and
universally
agreed
that
the
day
had
been
ripping
the
sixth
and
va
rather
puffed
up
with
their
archæological
researches
tried
to
be
superior
and
instructive
and
to
give
their
juniors
a
digest
of
what
they
had
learnt
at
the
abbey
but
at
this
vb
rebelled
you
had
your
fun
and
we
had
ours
said
annie
do
try
and
cram
architecture
down
our
throats
i
tell
you
frankly
i
ca
tell
the
difference
between
a
norman
arch
and
any
other
kind
of
one
and
i
want
to
you
utter
ignoramus
i
a
good
hare
if
i
nothing
else
chuckled
annie
we
must
have
led
them
a
run
of
about
fourteen
miles
deirdre
i
want
to
ask
you
something
said
gerda
that
evening
you
remember
that
crest
you
took
before
from
forster
folly
will
you
swop
it
with
me
for
some
chocolates
why
i
give
it
to
you
if
you
like
returned
deirdre
who
was
in
an
amiable
frame
of
mind
and
disposed
towards
generosity
tired
of
crest
collecting
and
i
taken
up
stamps
here
it
is
been
in
my
since
the
day
i
got
it
are
you
going
in
for
crests
they
my
latest
and
absolutely
dearest
hobby
declared
gerda
emphatically
chapter
xvii
a
discovery
after
the
delightful
dissipation
of
a
whole
day
holiday
miss
birks
demanded
a
period
of
solid
work
from
her
pupils
and
deeming
that
she
had
sufficiently
satisfied
their
craving
for
excitement
took
no
notice
of
either
hints
or
headaches
but
enforced
preparation
and
practising
with
as
dulcie
expressed
it
a
total
lack
of
all
consideration
dulcie
never
a
remarkably
hard
worker
at
any
season
was
more
than
usually
prone
to
slack
in
summer
and
it
needed
the
combined
energies
of
miss
birks
miss
harding
and
mademoiselle
to
keep
her
up
to
the
mark
it
was
more
than
ever
necessary
to
maintain
the
standard
at
present
for
examination
week
was
drawing
near
and
this
year
several
extra
prizes
were
offered
for
competition
trevellyan
had
promised
a
beautiful
edition
of
tennyson
poems
for
the
best
paper
on
english
literature
the
vicar
added
a
handsome
volume
of
from
for
the
most
correct
answers
to
scripture
history
and
mademoiselle
herself
proffered
a
copy
of
de
mon
for
the
most
spirited
declamation
of
any
piece
of
french
poetry
not
less
than
two
hundred
lines
in
length
the
quality
of
the
accent
to
be
particularly
taken
into
account
these
were
in
addition
to
the
usual
annual
rewards
for
mathematics
languages
english
history
music
drawing
and
needlecraft
so
that
among
so
many
various
subjects
each
girl
might
feel
that
she
had
at
least
some
chance
of
winning
success
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
principal
announced
that
a
prize
would
be
given
for
general
improvement
that
to
make
slackers
like
you
buck
up
dulcie
declared
annie
pridwell
really
i
wish
miss
birks
would
offer
a
prize
for
pure
english
said
jessie
macpherson
who
happened
to
overhear
the
slang
you
vb
talk
is
outrageous
your
whole
conversation
seems
made
up
of
and
and
and
other
silly
words
that
do
mean
anything
i
tell
you
slang
going
out
of
fashion
even
at
public
schools
and
you
behind
the
times
do
be
a
prig
jessie
what
else
can
i
call
dulcie
except
a
slacker
am
i
to
say
she
shows
a
languorous
disinclination
for
close
application
and
advise
her
to
exert
her
mental
activities
it
would
sound
like
a
from
a
young
ladies
seminary
of
a
hundred
years
ago
there
is
one
comfort
in
having
worked
badly
admitted
dulcie
if
i
make
a
spurt
now
i
shall
show
more
improvement
than
if
been
jogging
along
steadily
all
the
time
ah
but
the
tortoise
won
the
race
while
the
hare
slept
retorted
jessie
in
view
of
the
forthcoming
music
examination
practising
was
performed
with
double
diligence
and
from
to
the
strains
of
schumann
arabesque
tschaikowsky
chanson
triste
or
rachmaninoff
prelude
the
three
test
pieces
echoed
pretty
constantly
through
the
house
in
varying
degrees
of
proficiency
it
a
good
thing
nobody
belonging
to
the
school
has
to
do
the
judging
said
emily
northwood
as
she
stood
in
the
hall
listening
to
the
conflicting
sounds
of
three
pianos
even
miss
birks
must
be
so
sick
of
these
particular
pieces
that
she
could
hardly
express
a
fair
opinion
on
them
harvey
james
will
come
fresh
to
the
fray
the
organist
and
choirmaster
of
the
collegiate
church
at
wexminster
being
a
doctor
of
music
was
regarded
as
a
very
suitable
examiner
for
the
occasion
and
even
if
his
standard
proved
high
all
at
least
would
have
the
same
chance
for
he
had
not
visited
the
school
before
and
therefore
could
regard
nobody
with
special
favour
he
was
a
new
resident
in
the
district
and
miss
birks
hoped
next
term
to
arrange
for
him
to
come
over
weekly
and
give
lessons
to
her
more
advanced
pupils
who
would
be
likely
to
appreciate
his
musical
knowledge
and
profit
by
his
teaching
the
thought
of
having
to
play
before
their
prospective
music
master
spurred
on
most
of
the
girls
even
more
than
the
chance
of
the
prize
they
dashed
valiantly
at
difficult
passages
counted
diligently
and
loosened
their
muscles
with
exercises
each
anxious
to
be
placed
in
the
rank
of
those
sufficiently
advanced
to
be
transferred
to
his
tuition
the
drawing
students
also
though
they
could
not
practise
specially
for
their
own
prize
were
busy
finishing
copies
and
sketches
for
a
small
exhibition
of
work
done
during
the
school
year
which
was
to
be
held
in
one
of
the
classrooms
during
examination
week
and
criticized
by
leonard
pearce
an
artist
who
had
consented
to
set
and
judge
the
competition
miss
harding
was
urging
increased
attention
to
mathematics
miss
birks
was
giving
extra
coaching
in
history
and
english
literature
mademoiselle
was
hacking
away
at
languages
till
her
pupils
almost
wished
that
french
and
german
were
as
dead
as
ancient
egyptian
and
assyrian
so
it
was
a
very
busy
little
world
at
the
dower
house
so
busy
that
really
nobody
had
time
to
think
of
anything
else
the
principal
anxious
to
keep
her
flock
in
good
health
insisted
upon
the
recreation
hours
being
devoted
to
definite
exercise
and
either
games
or
organized
walks
under
the
supervision
of
a
mistress
were
compulsory
for
the
present
there
was
no
strolling
about
the
warren
in
threesomes
there
were
no
visits
to
the
headland
or
rambles
on
the
beach
the
girls
grumbled
a
little
at
this
lack
of
their
accustomed
freedom
complained
that
set
walks
reminded
them
of
a
penitentiary
and
declared
that
to
be
obliged
to
play
cricket
took
all
the
fun
out
of
it
they
thrived
on
the
system
however
and
were
able
to
manage
the
increased
brain
work
demanded
from
them
without
incurring
the
penalty
of
headaches
backaches
or
loss
of
appetite
a
few
certainly
pleaded
minor
ailments
as
an
excuse
for
shirking
but
miss
birks
long
experience
had
taught
her
to
distinguish
readily
between
real
illness
and
shamming
and
she
dismissed
the
invalids
each
with
a
dose
of
such
a
nauseous
compound
as
entirely
to
discourage
them
from
seeking
further
sympathy
her
bottle
a
harmless
mixture
of
turkey
rhubarb
and
carbonate
of
magnesia
might
have
been
a
magic
elixir
for
the
relief
of
all
diseases
for
with
the
same
marvellous
rapidity
it
cured
francie
palpitations
irene
dyspepsia
and
elyned
attacks
of
faintness
nasty
filthy
stuff
declared
the
indignant
sufferers
who
with
a
remembrance
of
miss
birks
treatment
of
the
measles
patients
had
fondly
expected
to
be
coddled
and
cosseted
regaled
on
and
lemonade
and
forbidden
to
overexert
themselves
serve
you
right
chuckled
their
friends
it
your
own
faults
for
you
could
expect
miss
birks
to
believe
in
your
whines
when
you
look
in
such
absolutely
rude
health
and
compass
your
meals
so
creditably
why
did
you
refuse
all
solid
food
oh
no
thank
you
and
declare
cocoa
made
you
shudder
that
beyond
a
joke
if
anybody
looks
ill
in
this
house
continued
annie
mademoiselle
she
pale
and
thin
if
you
like
and
eats
next
to
nothing
but
she
does
make
any
fuss
about
it
noticeably
mademoiselle
increased
work
and
anxiety
on
behalf
of
her
pupils
success
had
a
bad
effect
on
her
health
she
looked
worn
and
overdone
and
there
were
dark
circles
round
her
tired
eyes
though
she
did
not
complain
she
confessed
to
being
troubled
with
sleeplessness
night
after
night
she
lay
awake
till
daybreak
and
was
sometimes
only
dropping
into
a
doze
when
the
bell
clanged
in
the
passage
may
be
all
very
well
in
music
but
they
are
not
pleasant
when
one
experiences
them
she
confided
to
miss
harding
when
i
stay
waiting
for
sleep
i
hear
many
curious
sounds
yes
such
as
one
does
not
hear
during
the
daylight
a
house
is
always
full
of
creaks
and
groans
if
one
stays
awake
at
night
returned
miss
harding
you
must
mind
them
during
the
day
i
smile
at
them
continued
mademoiselle
but
if
i
keep
vigil
i
am
nervous
yes
i
shall
be
very
nervous
for
miss
birks
will
be
away
i
like
not
that
she
be
away
it
was
very
seldom
that
the
principal
gave
herself
a
holiday
during
the
term
but
for
once
she
was
going
to
london
to
attend
an
important
educational
meeting
and
would
spend
the
night
in
town
she
started
by
an
early
train
leaving
her
small
kingdom
in
perfect
order
and
confident
that
for
so
short
a
space
of
time
nothing
could
possibly
go
wrong
certainly
nothing
ought
to
have
gone
wrong
her
arrangements
were
excellent
and
miss
harding
was
thoroughly
capable
of
acting
deputy
during
her
absence
yet
there
is
an
old
proverb
that
while
the
away
the
mice
will
play
and
the
mere
fact
that
she
was
not
on
the
spot
made
a
difference
in
the
school
the
girls
did
not
give
any
trouble
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
relaxed
discipline
in
the
air
at
four
instead
of
going
straight
from
their
classroom
to
their
practising
deirdre
and
dulcie
decided
to
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
a
run
round
the
grounds
first
they
walked
briskly
through
the
shrubbery
down
the
steps
and
along
the
terrace
till
they
came
to
the
now
this
was
absolutely
forbidden
territory
to
the
girls
and
they
had
never
been
inside
it
the
gate
which
was
generally
locked
stood
temptingly
open
it
seemed
an
opportunity
too
good
to
be
resisted
with
one
accord
they
threw
rules
to
the
winds
and
decided
to
explore
a
thick
and
high
holly
hedge
effectually
screened
this
corner
of
the
grounds
from
wind
and
guarded
it
from
intruders
it
was
a
warm
productive
plot
of
land
and
entirely
provided
the
school
with
fruit
and
vegetables
deirdre
and
dulcie
did
not
trouble
about
the
currants
and
gooseberries
but
kept
straight
down
the
path
they
wished
particularly
to
investigate
the
far
end
here
the
garden
abutted
on
the
cliffs
which
sloped
downward
in
a
series
of
zigzag
ridges
the
girls
made
their
way
gingerly
over
a
bed
of
young
cabbages
to
the
borderland
where
rhubarb
and
merged
into
wormwood
and
ragwort
it
was
perfectly
easy
to
slip
over
the
edge
and
begin
to
go
down
the
first
long
shelving
slab
of
rock
there
was
a
drop
of
about
four
feet
on
to
the
second
shelf
which
again
sloped
downwards
at
a
gentle
level
to
a
third
here
the
cliff
ended
in
a
precipice
so
steep
that
even
the
most
experienced
climber
could
not
descend
without
a
rope
rather
baffled
the
two
girls
crept
cautiously
along
the
edge
then
deirdre
suddenly
gave
a
whoop
of
delight
for
she
had
spied
a
rough
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
surface
of
the
rock
and
evidently
leading
to
the
beach
below
it
was
rather
a
cat
staircase
to
venture
upon
but
they
were
possessed
with
a
thirst
for
exploration
and
were
not
easily
to
be
daunted
deirdre
went
first
and
shouted
encouragement
to
her
chum
and
dulcie
picked
up
heart
to
follow
so
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
they
found
themselves
safely
on
the
sands
at
the
bottom
whew
it
like
climbing
down
the
ladder
of
a
lighthouse
exclaimed
dulcie
subsiding
on
to
a
convenient
stone
her
legs
were
shaking
in
a
most
unaccountable
fashion
and
her
breath
coming
and
going
far
more
rapidly
than
was
comfortable
it
might
have
been
worse
affirmed
deirdre
trying
not
to
show
that
her
nerve
had
in
any
degree
failed
her
and
surveying
the
scene
with
the
eye
of
a
prospector
they
were
in
a
small
and
very
narrow
cove
so
hidden
between
cliffs
which
jutted
out
overhead
that
it
was
practically
invisible
from
above
and
certainly
could
not
be
seen
from
anywhere
in
the
school
grounds
it
was
a
pretty
little
creek
with
a
silvery
slip
of
beach
and
green
clumps
of
ferns
growing
high
up
in
the
interstices
of
the
rocks
quite
a
romantic
spot
so
beautiful
and
secluded
that
it
might
almost
be
the
haunt
of
a
mermaiden
or
a
water
nixie
the
ferns
which
were
flourishing
in
unusual
luxuriance
caught
deirdre
attention
i
believe
it
the
she
remarked
do
you
remember
we
found
some
at
kergoff
and
miss
birks
was
so
excited
about
it
sure
she
does
know
all
this
is
growing
at
the
very
bottom
of
her
own
garden
i
try
and
get
a
root
to
obtain
a
root
was
more
easily
said
than
done
however
most
of
the
clumps
of
fern
were
in
very
inaccessible
situations
and
too
deeply
embedded
in
the
rock
to
be
removed
deirdre
climbed
from
one
to
another
in
vain
then
noticing
a
particularly
fine
group
of
fronds
on
a
projecting
shelf
far
above
her
head
commenced
to
scale
the
cliff
she
reached
the
shelf
fairly
easily
but
instead
of
setting
to
work
to
try
to
uproot
the
fern
she
gave
a
long
whistle
of
surprise
what
the
matter
asked
dulcie
from
below
matter
come
up
yourself
and
see
oh
goody
dulcie
was
still
a
little
shaky
but
spurred
on
by
curiosity
she
got
up
the
cliff
somehow
and
added
a
hallo
of
amazement
to
her
exclamations
facing
them
was
the
entrance
to
a
cave
at
one
time
it
had
evidently
been
carefully
blocked
up
but
now
the
wooden
boarding
that
guarded
it
had
been
wrenched
asunder
leaving
a
small
opening
just
sufficient
to
enter
by
the
girls
peeped
cautiously
in
but
beyond
the
first
few
yards
all
was
dark
this
was
indeed
a
discovery
the
mouth
of
the
cave
was
so
effectually
hidden
by
the
crags
which
surrounded
it
that
nobody
would
have
suspected
its
existence
who
had
not
come
across
it
by
accident
what
secrets
lay
in
its
mysterious
depths
who
could
say
thrilled
with
excitement
the
girls
turned
to
one
another
if
we
could
only
explore
it
breathed
dulcie
we
going
to
returned
deirdre
firmly
i
shall
run
back
this
instant
to
the
house
for
a
candle
you
wait
here
deirdre
impatience
made
short
work
of
the
cat
staircase
she
scrambled
up
the
rocks
like
a
squirrel
and
was
soon
racing
up
the
to
secure
her
bedroom
candle
and
a
box
of
matches
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
as
she
pelted
impetuously
downstairs
again
she
nearly
fell
over
gerda
who
had
been
doing
preparation
in
the
schoolroom
and
scattered
the
pile
of
books
she
was
carrying
do
be
careful
said
the
latter
in
remonstrance
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
and
what
do
you
want
with
your
candle
never
you
mind
it
no
business
of
yours
retorted
deirdre
running
away
without
even
an
apology
gerda
picked
up
her
books
and
carried
them
upstairs
but
instead
of
continuing
her
preparation
she
went
to
the
window
she
was
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
deirdre
vanishing
down
the
the
sight
seemed
to
afford
her
food
for
thought
she
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
lost
in
indecision
then
evidently
making
up
her
mind
she
set
off
in
pursuit
of
her
deirdre
meanwhile
returned
to
the
cove
with
speed
and
agility
and
found
dulcie
waiting
where
she
had
left
her
i
had
a
horrible
feeling
that
a
monster
might
come
out
while
you
were
away
she
declared
do
you
think
we
dare
go
in
dare
of
course
we
dare
i
not
going
to
have
fetched
this
candle
for
nothing
dulcie
wilcox
where
your
pluck
come
along
this
minute
or
i
not
be
chums
with
you
again
here
you
may
hold
the
matches
having
lighted
the
candle
the
two
girls
stepped
through
the
breach
in
the
wooden
barricade
and
commenced
their
exploration
the
passage
high
at
first
soon
lowered
till
it
was
little
above
their
heads
and
narrowed
to
a
width
of
barely
three
feet
the
walls
which
for
the
first
ten
yards
were
worn
as
if
by
the
action
of
the
sea
became
more
jagged
and
had
plainly
been
hewn
out
with
the
aid
of
a
pick
the
natural
cavern
having
been
greatly
extended
here
and
there
the
floor
was
wet
and
the
roof
showed
an
oozy
deposit
as
if
some
surface
spring
were
forcing
itself
through
the
strata
of
the
rock
on
and
on
the
girls
went
for
two
hundred
yards
or
more
deirdre
going
first
and
holding
the
candle
well
in
front
of
her
so
as
to
see
the
way
it
was
delightfully
exciting
yet
there
was
a
thrill
of
horror
about
it
for
who
could
tell
what
might
be
lurking
round
the
next
corner
dulcie
nerves
were
strung
to
such
a
pitch
that
she
was
ready
to
scream
at
the
least
alarm
not
a
sound
however
broke
the
dead
silence
the
passage
in
its
lonely
calm
might
have
been
the
entrance
to
an
egyptian
tomb
does
it
lead
anywhere
whispered
dulcie
oh
had
we
better
turn
back
we
gone
far
enough
i
going
to
the
end
if
it
in
australia
replied
deirdre
and
having
possession
of
the
candle
she
was
in
a
position
to
dictate
a
few
extra
yards
however
concluded
their
journey
the
passage
being
once
again
blocked
by
a
wooden
barrier
this
was
more
carefully
constructed
than
the
one
at
the
entrance
being
made
of
timber
and
fitted
with
a
door
which
stood
open
and
led
into
a
rough
kind
of
chamber
rather
resembling
the
crypt
of
a
church
at
the
far
side
of
this
there
was
a
small
closed
door
well
we
got
into
a
queer
place
exclaimed
deirdre
must
have
been
a
smuggler
cellar
i
should
say
no
doubt
they
used
to
keep
kegs
and
kegs
of
brandy
down
here
in
the
good
old
days
look
the
roof
is
vaulted
over
there
where
does
that
door
lead
to
the
little
door
in
question
had
apparently
been
opened
by
force
to
judge
from
the
broken
lock
and
the
marks
of
some
sharp
instrument
on
the
jambs
at
present
it
was
closed
but
not
fastened
what
lay
beyond
with
a
feeling
that
they
had
arrived
at
the
of
their
adventure
deirdre
opened
it
and
peeped
in
she
found
herself
looking
down
from
an
eminence
of
about
four
feet
into
a
bedroom
the
room
was
in
complete
darkness
for
the
window
was
barred
with
heavy
wooden
shutters
but
by
the
aid
of
her
candle
she
could
see
it
was
unoccupied
giving
the
light
to
dulcie
to
hold
she
cautiously
descended
then
aided
her
chum
to
follow
the
door
through
which
they
had
stepped
formed
part
of
the
panelling
over
the
mantelpiece
and
when
closed
with
its
original
spring
would
no
doubt
have
been
indistinguishable
from
the
rest
of
the
woodwork
the
room
though
neglected
and
in
great
disorder
nevertheless
bore
traces
of
recent
habitation
the
bed
with
its
tumbled
blankets
had
certainly
been
slept
in
on
the
spread
out
on
a
newspaper
were
the
remains
of
a
meal
a
small
oil
held
a
kettle
and
one
or
two
little
packets
probably
containing
tea
and
sugar
lay
about
on
the
floor
torn
into
small
pieces
were
the
shreds
of
a
letter
written
in
german
dusty
and
untended
as
it
was
now
the
room
must
once
have
been
pretty
and
bore
strong
evidence
of
the
ownership
of
a
little
girl
on
the
walls
hung
framed
colour
prints
of
millais
cherry
ripe
little
gamp
little
red
riding
hood
and
miss
muffet
in
the
corner
stood
a
doll
house
a
doll
cradle
and
a
miniature
chest
of
drawers
a
chiffonier
seemed
to
be
a
repository
for
numerous
treasures
a
set
of
tiny
alabaster
cups
and
saucers
a
glass
globe
which
when
shaken
reproduced
a
snowstorm
inside
a
a
walnut
a
small
japanese
cabinet
and
a
whole
row
of
juvenile
books
deirdre
took
up
some
of
the
latter
blew
the
dust
off
and
examined
them
they
were
volumes
of
and
of
many
years
ago
on
the
of
each
was
written
to
darling
lillie
from
father
and
mother
in
greatest
amazement
the
girls
wandered
round
the
room
looking
first
at
one
thing
then
at
another
how
old
the
dust
was
that
mostly
covered
them
here
and
there
it
had
been
hastily
swept
away
to
make
a
clearance
for
cup
and
saucer
or
provisions
but
in
general
the
little
possessions
were
untouched
even
some
new
year
cards
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
bearing
greetings
and
good
wishes
for
the
coming
season
i
want
to
see
better
said
deirdre
this
wretched
candle
only
gives
half
a
light
i
never
been
in
such
a
fascinating
place
help
me
dulcie
and
we
try
and
unfasten
the
shutters
the
heavy
iron
bar
was
old
and
rusty
it
must
have
been
in
its
place
for
many
a
long
year
for
some
time
the
girls
pushed
and
tugged
in
vain
then
with
a
mighty
effort
they
dislodged
it
from
its
socket
and
let
it
clatter
down
deirdre
slowly
swung
aside
the
shutter
after
the
faint
light
of
their
one
candle
the
flood
of
sunshine
which
burst
in
completely
dazzled
them
as
soon
as
they
could
see
they
peeped
out
through
the
dingy
panes
of
glass
to
their
immense
surprise
they
found
they
were
looking
into
the
dower
house
garden
then
deirdre
suddenly
realized
the
truth
dulcie
dulcie
she
cried
i
verily
believe
we
in
the
barred
room
there
seemed
little
doubt
about
the
matter
when
they
came
to
consider
it
the
position
of
the
window
corresponded
exactly
with
the
one
which
had
always
faced
them
from
the
and
whose
secret
they
had
so
often
discussed
the
mystery
instead
of
becoming
clearer
seemed
only
to
deepen
why
was
one
of
the
bedrooms
in
the
dower
house
filled
with
a
child
possessions
and
sealed
with
iron
bars
yet
accessible
from
a
cave
on
the
beach
and
evidently
in
present
occupation
the
daylight
revealed
its
extraordinary
condition
with
great
clearness
the
dust
dirt
and
cobwebs
looked
forlorn
in
the
extreme
on
a
hook
on
the
door
which
presumably
led
into
the
dower
house
landing
hung
a
net
filled
with
hard
wooden
balls
and
as
the
draught
blew
in
from
the
opening
over
the
fireplace
these
swayed
about
and
knocked
with
a
gentle
rapping
against
the
panel
there
your
ghost
dulcie
said
deirdre
that
was
the
you
heard
in
the
passage
it
was
a
spook
after
all
you
see
you
were
just
as
scared
as
i
was
protested
dulcie
i
think
rather
scared
now
let
go
suppose
whoever
been
here
making
tea
were
to
come
back
i
believe
i
have
hysterics
there
was
something
in
dulcie
suggestion
it
had
not
before
occurred
to
deirdre
that
it
would
be
unpleasant
if
the
owner
of
the
kettle
were
to
return
and
demand
an
explanation
of
their
presence
we
must
put
the
shutters
back
she
decreed
this
was
easier
said
than
done
but
after
considerable
trouble
they
managed
to
restore
the
room
once
more
to
its
former
state
of
darkness
their
candle
was
burning
rather
low
but
they
hoped
it
would
be
sufficient
to
light
them
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
the
aid
of
a
chair
they
climbed
on
to
the
mantelpiece
passed
through
the
door
in
the
panelling
to
the
vaulted
chamber
and
on
into
the
subterranean
passage
they
scurried
along
as
fast
as
they
could
without
stumbling
partly
from
fear
that
the
candle
would
go
out
and
partly
in
dread
lest
somebody
should
be
coming
from
the
entrance
and
meet
them
on
the
way
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
that
bearing
the
last
guttering
scrap
of
candle
they
at
length
emerged
into
the
daylight
here
we
are
safe
and
sound
and
met
no
bogy
thank
goodness
rejoiced
dulcie
there
our
bogy
waiting
said
deirdre
pointing
to
a
school
hat
which
suddenly
made
its
appearance
from
below
gerda
by
all
that
wonderful
gasped
dulcie
yes
it
was
gerda
who
had
followed
them
and
who
now
watched
them
as
they
came
out
of
the
cave
she
was
paler
than
usual
and
there
was
a
queer
set
look
about
her
mouth
so
that
was
what
you
wanted
the
candle
for
you
might
have
told
me
she
remarked
the
two
girls
began
an
animated
account
of
their
strange
adventure
they
were
so
full
of
it
that
at
the
moment
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
avoid
talking
about
it
gerda
listened
calmly
though
she
asked
one
or
two
questions
she
spoke
with
the
constrained
manner
of
one
who
is
putting
a
strong
control
on
herself
so
you
found
nothing
to
explain
the
mystery
she
queried
nothing
at
all
is
it
lillie
who
living
there
and
doing
her
own
cooking
and
is
she
a
girl
or
a
spook
added
dulcie
spooks
do
drink
tea
she
must
be
alive
said
deirdre
i
wonder
if
miss
birks
knows
about
her
i
guess
we
better
not
divulge
the
secret
chuckled
dulcie
what
would
miss
birks
say
to
us
for
trespassing
in
the
particularly
when
she
away
we
should
get
into
a
jolly
row
agreed
deirdre
we
shall
all
three
get
into
one
as
it
is
if
we
do
go
back
quickly
observed
gerda
rather
the
chums
obeyed
her
suggestion
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
slip
from
the
without
being
observed
and
hoped
their
escapade
would
not
be
discovered
after
tea
they
hurried
to
make
up
arrears
of
practising
but
gerda
evading
the
vigilance
of
mademoiselle
gave
an
excuse
to
miss
harding
and
absented
herself
from
preparation
stealing
very
cautiously
from
the
house
she
dived
through
the
shrubbery
and
ran
out
on
to
the
warren
casting
many
a
hasty
glance
behind
her
to
see
if
she
were
observed
she
hurried
along
till
she
reached
the
little
point
above
perran
well
where
a
rough
pile
of
stones
made
a
natural
beacon
easily
visible
from
the
sea
or
from
the
beach
below
taking
her
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
she
tied
it
to
a
stick
which
she
planted
at
the
summit
of
the
pile
waving
in
the
breeze
it
was
a
conspicuous
object
she
watched
it
for
a
moment
or
two
then
walked
back
along
the
cliff
with
the
drooping
air
of
one
who
is
almost
ready
to
collapse
after
meeting
a
great
emergency
it
was
a
near
thing
a
near
thing
she
muttered
to
herself
suppose
they
met
oh
it
too
horrible
it
was
too
risky
an
experiment
really
i
hope
my
danger
signal
plain
enough
i
must
get
up
early
and
take
it
down
before
anyone
from
the
school
sees
it
be
difficult
with
those
two
in
the
room
but
i
manage
it
somehow
fortunately
they
both
sound
sleepers
chapter
xviii
an
alarm
that
same
evening
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
it
was
the
custom
for
glasses
of
milk
dishes
of
stewed
fruit
and
plates
of
bread
and
butter
to
be
placed
on
the
table
in
the
about
eight
this
was
done
as
usual
but
when
the
girls
arrived
for
supper
they
found
a
large
proportion
of
the
bread
and
butter
had
vanished
at
first
the
suspicion
fell
on
spot
the
but
the
cook
pleaded
an
alibi
on
his
behalf
proving
that
he
had
been
in
the
kitchen
the
whole
time
also
the
rifled
plates
were
in
the
middle
of
the
table
so
no
dog
could
have
purloined
their
contents
without
knocking
over
glasses
or
disturbing
spoons
and
forks
i
afraid
it
a
dog
said
miss
harding
gravely
the
french
window
was
open
and
it
would
be
easy
for
anyone
to
walk
in
and
help
himself
i
glad
nothing
more
valuable
was
taken
i
wish
miss
birks
were
here
it
most
unfortunate
it
should
happen
on
the
very
evening
she
away
the
incident
gave
cause
for
serious
apprehension
miss
harding
made
a
most
careful
round
of
the
house
before
bedtime
to
see
that
all
bolts
and
shutters
were
well
secured
though
she
would
not
betray
her
alarm
to
the
girls
she
was
afraid
that
a
burglary
might
be
committed
during
the
night
both
she
and
mademoiselle
kept
awake
till
dawn
listening
for
suspicious
footsteps
on
the
gravel
outside
all
was
as
usual
however
in
the
morning
there
were
no
evidences
of
attempts
to
force
locks
or
windows
and
no
trace
of
the
mysterious
thief
who
had
taken
the
bread
and
butter
mademoiselle
reported
indeed
that
she
had
again
heard
the
curious
sounds
which
for
some
nights
past
had
disturbed
her
she
had
risen
and
patrolled
the
house
and
had
come
to
the
unmistakable
conclusion
that
they
issued
from
the
barred
room
the
closed
chamber
was
as
much
a
riddle
to
teachers
as
to
girls
so
miss
harding
merely
shook
her
head
and
recommended
mademoiselle
to
tell
her
experiences
to
miss
birks
as
soon
as
the
principal
returned
at
five
that
afternoon
elyned
hughes
came
running
downstairs
with
a
white
scared
face
she
solemnly
averred
that
when
passing
the
door
of
the
mysterious
room
she
had
heard
extraordinary
noises
within
it
was
exactly
like
somebody
moving
about
and
frying
sausages
i
smelled
them
too
she
declared
the
report
was
in
part
confirmed
by
several
other
girls
who
pledged
their
word
that
they
heard
stealthy
movements
when
they
listened
at
the
barred
door
are
you
absolutely
certain
or
is
it
only
mice
queried
gerda
so
often
fancied
things
mice
do
clink
cans
and
strike
matches
and
clear
their
throats
retorted
rhoda
but
you
may
have
thought
it
sounded
like
that
i
could
be
mistaken
somebody
there
beyond
a
doubt
said
agnes
perhaps
it
a
ghost
queried
elyned
it
nothing
supernatural
this
time
i
undertake
to
say
whatever
may
have
made
the
noises
before
it
ought
to
be
enquired
into
declared
doris
miss
birks
ought
to
insist
on
having
the
bars
taken
down
and
seeing
what
going
on
oh
no
no
it
best
to
leave
things
as
they
are
gerda
was
looking
white
and
upset
and
spoke
almost
hysterically
do
you
expect
the
ghost
to
bolt
in
amongst
us
the
moment
the
door
is
unlocked
mocked
rhoda
no
of
course
i
not
so
silly
but
it
often
better
to
let
well
alone
trevellyan
is
still
away
so
miss
birks
could
ask
her
to
have
the
bars
taken
down
now
volunteered
betty
scott
so
she
is
exclaimed
gerda
with
an
air
of
relief
ah
you
afraid
of
the
ghost
repeated
rhoda
i
more
inclined
towards
the
burglar
theory
in
the
circumstances
i
think
miss
birks
would
be
quite
justified
in
making
an
investigation
even
without
trevellyan
permission
i
should
wonder
myself
if
miss
birks
called
in
the
police
said
betty
scott
the
girls
were
in
a
ferment
of
excitement
over
the
affair
deirdre
and
dulcie
felt
that
in
view
of
yesterday
discovery
they
had
a
strong
clue
to
the
mystery
they
hesitated
as
to
whether
they
ought
at
once
to
tell
miss
harding
but
as
miss
birks
was
expected
home
within
an
hour
or
two
they
decided
it
was
better
to
wait
till
they
could
deliver
their
news
at
gerda
during
the
whole
day
had
been
very
abstracted
and
peculiar
in
her
manner
she
was
nervous
starting
at
every
sound
and
seemed
so
preoccupied
with
her
own
thoughts
that
she
often
took
no
notice
when
spoken
to
what
wrong
with
the
sphinx
commented
deirdre
she
absolutely
obsessed
yes
i
ca
make
her
out
she
disturbed
in
her
mind
that
easy
enough
to
see
there
something
queer
going
on
in
this
school
i
hope
she
not
mixed
up
in
it
we
decidedly
better
watch
her
after
all
that
happened
before
one
ca
trust
her
in
the
least
until
miss
birks
is
safely
back
in
the
house
i
feel
we
ought
to
let
gerda
out
of
our
sight
who
knows
what
she
may
be
going
to
do
or
whom
she
in
league
with
coupled
with
the
mysterious
happenings
of
last
night
and
palpable
uneasiness
gave
strong
grounds
for
suspicion
the
chums
watched
her
like
a
couple
of
detectives
they
were
determined
to
warn
miss
birks
directly
on
her
return
meanwhile
nothing
their
did
must
escape
their
notice
they
were
to
perform
a
duet
at
the
musical
examination
therefore
they
had
the
extreme
felicity
of
doing
their
practising
together
for
the
same
gerda
was
due
at
the
instrument
in
the
next
room
they
waited
to
begin
until
they
heard
the
first
bars
of
her
arabesque
at
the
same
moment
came
from
the
hall
the
sounds
of
the
bustle
occasioned
by
miss
birks
arrival
home
deirdre
and
dulcie
looked
at
one
another
in
much
relief
she
just
be
downstairs
again
by
the
time
we
finished
practising
and
then
we
go
straight
and
tell
her
they
agreed
i
am
afraid
neither
in
the
least
gave
her
mind
to
the
piano
mademoiselle
had
she
been
near
would
have
been
highly
irate
at
the
wrong
notes
and
other
faults
that
marred
the
beauty
of
their
mazurka
both
girls
were
playing
with
an
ear
for
the
arabesque
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
she
stopped
exclaimed
dulcie
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
bar
now
what
that
for
i
should
like
to
know
i
do
trust
you
miss
gerda
thorwaldson
but
deirdre
was
already
at
the
window
look
look
she
gasped
gerda
off
somewhere
the
window
of
the
adjacent
room
was
a
french
one
and
the
girls
could
see
their
schoolfellow
open
it
gently
and
steal
cautiously
out
on
to
the
lawn
she
glanced
round
to
see
if
she
were
observed
then
ran
off
in
the
direction
of
the
in
a
moment
the
chums
had
thrown
up
the
sash
of
their
window
and
followed
her
all
their
old
suspicions
of
her
had
revived
in
full
force
they
were
certain
she
was
in
league
with
somebody
and
for
no
good
purpose
and
they
were
determined
that
at
last
they
would
unmask
her
and
expose
her
duplicity
they
had
spared
her
before
but
this
time
they
intended
to
act
and
act
promptly
too
gerda
opened
the
gate
of
the
as
confidently
as
if
she
were
not
transgressing
a
rule
and
rushed
away
between
the
strawberry
beds
pilfering
was
evidently
not
her
object
for
she
never
even
looked
at
the
fruit
but
kept
straight
on
towards
the
end
where
the
grew
keeping
her
well
within
sight
the
chums
went
swiftly
but
cautiously
after
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
piece
of
waste
ground
that
bounded
the
cliff
looked
carefully
round
her
pursuers
were
hidden
behind
a
tree
then
plunged
down
the
side
of
the
rock
and
out
of
sight
deirdre
and
dulcie
each
drew
a
long
breath
the
conclusion
was
certain
without
doubt
she
must
be
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
cave
which
communicated
with
the
mysterious
chamber
whom
did
she
expect
to
find
there
to
me
there
only
one
course
open
declared
deirdre
solemnly
we
must
go
straight
to
miss
birks
and
tell
her
this
very
instant
the
principal
disturbed
in
the
midst
of
changing
her
travelling
costume
listened
with
amazement
to
her
insistent
pupils
excited
account
this
must
be
investigated
immediately
she
declared
dulcie
fetch
a
candle
and
matches
and
you
must
both
accompany
me
to
this
cave
you
say
gerda
has
gone
on
there
alone
miss
birks
took
the
affair
gravely
she
appeared
very
much
concerned
even
alarmed
she
hurried
off
at
once
with
the
girls
to
the
they
led
the
way
down
the
narrow
staircase
cut
in
the
cliff
and
across
the
beach
and
over
the
rocks
at
the
entrance
to
the
cave
they
both
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
for
gerda
stood
there
in
an
attitude
of
hesitation
as
if
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
enter
or
no
she
turned
red
and
white
and
then
red
again
to
the
tips
of
her
ears
when
she
saw
that
she
was
discovered
but
she
offered
no
explanation
of
her
presence
there
she
did
not
even
speak
girls
said
miss
birks
i
think
it
is
highly
desirable
and
necessary
that
we
should
follow
this
passage
into
the
room
which
i
am
told
is
beyond
deirdre
you
go
first
with
this
candle
then
dulcie
gerda
give
me
your
candle
and
walk
just
in
front
of
me
policing
the
three
in
the
rear
the
principal
gave
nobody
an
opportunity
to
escape
she
had
her
own
reasons
for
her
conduct
which
at
present
she
did
not
choose
to
explain
with
a
hand
on
gerda
shoulder
she
forced
that
unwilling
explorer
along
and
she
urged
an
occasional
caution
on
deirdre
they
had
reached
the
cavern
and
now
opening
the
small
inner
door
flashed
their
candles
into
the
room
the
result
was
startling
on
the
bed
reclined
a
figure
which
at
sight
of
the
light
sprang
up
with
the
cry
of
a
hare
in
a
trap
a
man
unkempt
ragged
and
dirty
bearing
the
impress
of
tramp
written
plainly
upon
his
haggard
unshaven
countenance
he
darted
wildly
forward
gazed
up
at
the
strangers
regarding
him
then
threw
himself
on
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
gerda
gave
a
long
sigh
of
supreme
relief
it
was
evidently
not
at
all
what
she
had
expected
to
see
i
done
whimpered
the
tramp
send
for
the
bobbies
if
you
like
go
quiet
you
must
first
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
here
said
miss
birks
stepping
down
into
the
room
then
i
can
decide
whether
or
no
it
is
necessary
to
call
in
the
police
who
are
you
and
where
do
you
come
from
i
knowed
this
passage
when
i
was
a
boy
was
the
whining
reply
we
used
to
dare
each
other
to
go
up
it
but
the
door
at
the
end
was
firm
shut
then
when
i
come
back
down
on
my
luck
and
without
a
penny
in
my
pocket
to
pay
for
a
lodging
i
thought
i
at
least
spend
a
night
there
under
cover
i
a
bit
of
candle
and
a
few
matches
so
i
found
my
way
along
easy
and
there
if
the
door
at
the
end
was
broke
open
and
the
place
waitin
all
ready
for
me
bed
kettle
cup
and
saucer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
just
as
if
someone
put
there
a
purpose
i
was
long
in
takin
possession
and
i
lived
here
five
days
and
done
nobody
no
harm
i
did
take
nothing
from
the
house
either
except
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
last
night
when
i
felt
starving
days
i
found
a
job
on
the
quay
and
was
able
to
buy
myself
victuals
did
you
cook
sausages
quavered
dulcie
with
intense
interest
aye
i
earned
a
bit
this
morning
to
buy
with
do
know
who
set
up
a
stove
here
but
it
come
in
handy
for
me
all
filled
ready
with
oil
too
but
you
know
you

right
here
said
miss
birks
severely
no
mum
reverting
to
his
original
whine
i
know
that
but
i
a
poor
man
and
i
been
unfortunate
i
came
back
to
my
native
place
looking
for
a
bit
of
work
i
bin
half
over
the
world
since
i
left
it
if
you
a
pontperran
man
somebody
ought
to
be
able
to
vouch
for
you
what
your
name
abel
galsworthy
then
gerda
sprang
forward
with
intense
irrepressible
excitement
on
her
face
not
abel
galsworthy
who
was
at
one
time
at
the
castle
she
queried
eagerly
the
same
at
your
service
miss
and
you
were
dismissed
for
for
for
borrowing
a
matter
of
a
few
pears
that
made
a
little
disagreement
betwixt
me
and
the
head
gardener
i
swore
i
try
another
line
of
life
and
i
shipped
as
a
fireman
on
board
a
steamer
bound
for
america
and
worked
my
way
over
the
continent
to
california
i
did
get
on
with
the
yankees
so
i
took
a
turn
to
australia
but
that
did
suit
me
no
better
and
after
i
knocked
about
till
i
was
tired
of
it
i
come
home
do
you
remember
that
when
you
were
at
the
castle
you
witnessed
a
paper
that
the
old
squire
signed
aye
i
remember
it
as
if
it
was
yesterday
me
and
jim
robinson
the
was
the
witnesses
but
jim

gone
this
many
a
year

you
know
your
own
handwriting
again
could
you
swear
to
it
i
take
my
bible
oath
afore
a
judge
and
jury
if

then
oh
thank
heaven

have
pieced
the
broken
link
of
my
chain
cried
gerda
oh

really
clear
my
father
name
at
last
and
wipe
the
stain
from
the
honour
of
the
trevellyans
what
does
she
mean
asked
dulcie
i
do
understand
it
all
a
puzzle
to
me
said
deirdre
what
does
gerda
know
about
the
castle
and
the
old
squire
and
a
paper
and
what
has
she
to
do
with
the
honour
of
the
trevellyans
i
guessed
the
riddle
long
ago
smiled
miss
birks
laying
a
friendly
hand
on
gerda
arm
the
likeness
to
ronnie
was
enough
to
tell
me
that
she
was
his
sister
chapter
xix
a
torn
letter
in
order
to
understand
the
events
which
were
happening
at
the
dower
house
we
must
go
back
for
a
period
of
some
years
in
the
history
of
the
family
at
the
castle
the
late
owner
squire
trevellyan
having
lost
his
only
child
had
practically
adopted
his
nephew
trevellyan
as
his
heir
he
had
indeed
other
nephews
and
nieces
but
they
were
the
children
of
his
sisters
and
it
seemed
to
him
fitting
that
the
only
one
who
bore
the
family
name
of
trevellyan
should
inherit
his
cornish
estate
the
young
fellow
was
an
immense
favourite
with
his
uncle
and
aunt
they
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
a
son
the
castle
was
considered
his
home
and
they
had
even
decided
upon
an
alliance
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
baronet
but
in
this
matter
had
defied
the
wishes
of
the
autocratic
old
squire
and
making
his
own
choice
had
wedded
a
lady
of
less
aristocratic
birth
his
marriage
caused
a
great
coolness
between
himself
and
his
uncle
and
aunt
his
bride
was
not
asked
to
the
castle
nor
openly
recognized
and
he
was
given
to
understand
that
he
had
seriously
injured
his
chances
of
succession
to
the
estate
his
cousins
who
had
long
been
jealous
of
his
prospects
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
of
this
opportunity
and
did
all
they
could
to
make
mischief
and
to
widen
the
breach
matters
went
on
thus
for
about
ten
years
during
which
time
though
squire
and
trevellyan
occasionally
asked
to
the
castle
they
still
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
his
wife
and
did
not
see
either
of
his
children
at
the
squire
death
there
was
great
anxiety
among
the
relatives
to
know
how
he
had
disposed
of
his
property
when
the
will
was
read
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
the
castle
and
entire
estate
to
his
wife
with
power
to
bequeath
it
as
she
wished
and
equal
money
legacies
to
all
his
nephews
and
nieces
but
at
the
end
came
a
codicil
revoking
the
former
part
of
the
will
leaving
only
small
legacies
to
the
other
nephews
and
nieces
but
a
large
sum
to
and
bequeathing
the
castle
and
property
to
him
after
death
the
relations
furiously
angry
to
be
thus
cut
out
disputed
the
validity
of
the
codicil
there
were
many
points
in
its
disfavour
the
lawyer
who
had
drawn
it
up
was
dead
and
of
the
two
witnesses
who
had
signed
their
names
to
it
one
was
missing
and
the
other
dead
there
was
therefore
not
a
solitary
person
left
to
vouch
for
it
the
family
decided
to
go
to
law
and
in
the
case
which
followed
the
handwriting
experts
decided
that
the
signature
to
the
codicil
was
not
genuine
giving
it
as
their
opinion
that
it
had
been
forged
by
trevellyan
the
case
against
looked
extremely
black
for
he
had
been
staying
at
the
castle
at
the
time
of
his
uncle
illness
and
death
in
view
of
the
decision
in
the
case
a
criminal
charge
of
forgery
was
laid
against
him
and
a
warrant
issued
for
his
arrest
before
it
was
out
however
he
had
disappeared
no
one
knew
whither
to
trevellyan
the
evidence
seemed
overwhelming
and
in
spite
of
her
great
affection
for
her
nephew
she
believed
him
guilty
it
had
always
been
her
great
wish
that
the
castle
and
estate
should
pass
to
one
who
bore
the
name
of
trevellyan
and
at
this
dreadful
crisis
she
offered
to
adopt
little
son
and
to
bring
him
up
as
heir
to
the
property
her
one
condition
was
that
she
must
have
the
child
absolutely
and
that
his
father
and
mother
should
not
attempt
in
any
way
to
obtain
access
to
him
in
his
desperate
circumstances
had
consented
the
boy
was
handed
over
to
his
and
had
been
brought
up
at
the
castle
without
any
remembrance
of
his
own
home
and
parents
the
affair
had
of
course
made
a
great
stir
in
the
neighbourhood
but
as
had
not
remained
in
the
country
to
face
a
prosecution
and
therefore
no
trial
of
the
case
had
followed
opinions
were
divided
as
to
his
guilt
in
the
course
of
five
years
the
excitement
had
died
down
and
though
the
story
was
well
known
at
pontperran
it
was
regarded
as
the
trevellyan
family
skeleton
and
best
buried
in
oblivion
miss
birks
had
tried
to
keep
the
matter
from
her
pupils
they
had
a
vague
knowledge
that
ronnie
father
was
unsatisfactory
but
they
had
been
able
to
glean
no
further
details
in
view
however
of
the
strange
chain
of
events
which
had
just
transpired
miss
birks
gave
deirdre
and
dulcie
in
private
a
hasty
outline
of
the
circumstances
telling
them
that
gerda
was
in
reality
the
daughter
of
trevellyan
and
that
from
certain
evidence
which
she
had
been
able
to
collect
she
was
confident
of
disproving
the
charge
which
had
been
brought
against
her
father
though
the
chums
were
thus
briefly
in
possession
of
their
secret
they
felt
there
were
many
pieces
in
the
puzzle
which
they
could
not
yet
fit
together
when
they
went
to
bed
that
night
they
begged
gerda
to
give
them
a
full
and
complete
explanation
to
their
surprise
she
immediately
consented
indeed
instead
of
keeping
her
old
habit
of
reserve
she
seemed
anxious
to
take
them
into
her
confidence
and
to
pour
her
whole
story
into
their
listening
ears
if
you
ronnie
sister
you
ca
be
gerda
thorwaldson
said
dulcie
i
did
know
ronnie
had
a
sister
i
thought
he
was
an
only
child
there
are
just
the
two
of
us
replied
gerda
i
am
nine
years
older
than
he
is
so
i
always
felt
almost
like
a
mother
to
him
shall
i
tell
you
everything
quite
from
the
beginning
miss
harding
will
excuse
us
for
talking
when
our
terrible
trouble
came
upon
us
ronnie
was
only
fifteen
months
old
such
a
darling
he
could
just
walk
and
say
little
words
i
have
his
photo
inside
my
you
can
imagine
the
grief
it
was
to
part
with
him
our
baby
who
never
been
a
day
from
us
mother
was
very
brave
she
realized
that
she
had
to
decide
between
father
and
her
boy
and
of
course
she
chose
father
we
knew
it
was
entirely
for
ronnie
good
trevellyan
would
bring
him
up
in
the
old
family
home
as
an
english
boy
should
be
and
would
make
him
her
heir
and
we
could
only
take
him
from
one
foreign
place
to
another
and
give
him
nothing
but
poverty
and
a
tarnished
name
you
know
of
course
that
my
father
was
accused
of
having
forged
a
codicil
to
his
uncle
squire
trevellyan
will
by
a
round
of
misfortune
everything
seemed
to
combine
in
his
disfavour
one
witness
to
the
codicil
was
dead
the
other
was
missing
and
though
advertisements
were
put
in
the
papers
offering
a
reward
for
news
of
his
whereabouts
he
could
not
be
found
forster
the
lawyer
who
had
drawn
up
both
the
will
and
the
codicil
was
dead
so
there
was
no
evidence
on
father
side
and
the
case
went
heavily
against
him
the
codicil
having
been
disproved
the
public
prosecutor
stepped
in
and
issued
a
warrant
to
arrest
my
father
on
a
charge
of
forgery
in
the
circumstances
with
no
witnesses
obtainable
it
was
not
considered
wise
for
him
to
stand
the
doubtful
chance
of
a
trial
and
acting
on
the
advice
of
his
best
friends
though
very
much
against
his
own
wishes
he
quietly
left
the
country
for
nearly
five
years
he
mother
and
i
have
lived
together
in
various
continental
towns
constantly
moving
on
as
we
feared
the
foreign
police
might
recognize
the
description
circulated
at
the
time
of
his
escape
and
arrest
him
under
an
extradition
warrant
for
safety
we
changed
our
name
at
almost
every
place
i
can
not
express
the
wretched
uncertainty
and
the
misery
of
this
hunted
life
especially
when
we
knew
the
charge
to
be
so
utterly
false
there
would
have
been
only
one
worse
evil
to
see
him
wrongfully
sentenced
and
sent
to
a
convict
prison
the
dread
of
that
possible
horror
we
endured
from
day
to
day
meantime
mother
though
she
would
not
confess
it
fretted
terribly
at
ronnie
loss
as
year
after
year
went
by
and
she
pictured
him
growing
older
it
became
harder
and
harder
for
her
to
exist
without
hearing
the
least
word
about
him
i
had
even
one
poor
little
snapshot
photo
it
would
comfort
me
she
said
once
would
show
me
my
darling
is
well
and
happy
and
cared
for
in
his
new
home
then
an
idea
came
to
me
though
i
had
never
been
at
pontperran
in
my
life
i
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
of
the
dower
house
and
i
knew
it
was
close
to
the
castle
i
begged
to
be
sent
to
school
there
for
i
thought
i
should
find
some
opportunity
of
seeing
ronnie
and
not
only
taking
a
photo
of
him
but
sending
news
about
him
to
mother
i
hoped
also
but
it
seemed
such
a
forlorn
hope
that
if
i
were
on
the
spot
i
might
pick
up
some
information
that
might
throw
a
light
on
the
case
and
help
to
clear
my
father
honour
there
seemed
little
risk
of
my
being
detected
for
trevellyan
had
never
seen
me
aunt
edith
i
ought
to
call
her
and
i
meant
to
keep
carefully
out
of
her
way
mother
jumped
at
my
suggestion
i
could
see
that
the
mere
chance
of
news
of
ronnie
put
fresh
life
into
her
and
after
some
persuasion
father
agreed
to
let
me
go
i
took
the
name
of
gerda
thorwaldson
and
the
letters
to
miss
birks
arranging
for
me
to
be
received
as
a
pupil
were
written
from
donnerfest
a
little
town
in
germany
mother
brought
me
to
london
and
put
me
safely
into
the
train
for
cornwall
then
she
used
the
opportunity
of
being
in
england
to
pay
quiet
visits
to
some
of
her
own
relations
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
many
years
my
father
had
a
friend
a
man
who
believed
in
his
innocence
and
did
his
best
to
help
him
this
carr
took
him
a
cruise
on
his
yacht
and
came
to
cornish
waters
tacking
about
the
coast
from
avonporth
to
kergoff
by
borrowing
the
yacht
dinghy
father
was
able
sometimes
to
land
near
portperran
and
meet
me
for
a
few
minutes
of
course
it
was
a
terribly
risky
thing
to
do
for
he
was
liable
to
be
arrested
any
moment
that
he
set
his
foot
on
english
soil
but
he
longed
so
much
to
see
me
and
above
all
to
hear
what
i
could
tell
of
ronnie
he
was
so
anxious
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
little
fellow
for
himself
that
he
insisted
upon
venturing
farther
on
shore
he
knew
the
secret
of
the
barred
room
so
bringing
with
him
an
oil
a
kettle
and
a
few
other
things
from
the
yacht
he
took
up
his
quarters
there
for
a
while
i
was
in
an
agony
lest
he
should
be
discovered
i
can
not
tell
you
what
i
suffered
on
this
account
he
did
not
stay
the
whole
time
at
the
cave
indeed
he
lived
mostly
on
the
yacht
but
kept
spending
occasional
nights
in
the
secret
room
i
never
knew
whether
he
was
there
or
not
and
the
uncertainty
made
me
wretched
during
the
last
five
years
we
had
seemed
continually
to
be
standing
on
the
brink
of
a
volcano
and
i
was
always
prepared
to
face
the
worst
i
can
scarcely
express
how
deeply
i
realized
the
difference
between
myself
and
all
the
other
girls
at
school
i
know
you
thought
me
reserved
and
uncommunicative
and
and
everything
that
is
disagreeable
but
i
simply
dared
not
talk
for
fear
i
might
reveal
something
that
would
betray
my
father
you
with
your
happy
homes
and
nothing
to
conceal
how
can
you
understand
what
it
is
perpetually
to
guard
a
dreadful
secret
i
could
tell
you
nothing
about
my
home
for
we
had
no
home
we
had
only
moved
on
from
one
lodging
to
another
and
left
no
address
behind
i
could
see
that
you
misjudged
me
and
were
full
of
suspicions
but
i
could
not
explain
you
were
annoyed
with
me
for
winning
favour
with
ronnie
you
would
not
have
grudged
me
his
affection
if
you
had
known
how
i
had
craved
for
him
all
these
years
and
how
hard
how
very
hard
it
was
to
be
obliged
to
treat
him
as
if
i
were
an
entire
stranger
instead
of
his
own
sister
then
i
was
terribly
afraid
of
meeting
trevellyan
lest
she
should
recognize
my
likeness
to
my
father
and
guess
our
secret
i
avoided
her
on
every
possible
occasion
and
on
the
whole
i
managed
very
successfully
to
keep
out
of
her
way
but
mother
was
pining
and
yearning
to
see
ronnie
the
little
photos
i
had
sent
and
my
descriptions
of
him
added
to
the
fact
of
her
being
in
england
so
near
to
him
only
made
her
long
for
him
more
bitterly
than
before
it
seemed
so
cruel
that
she
his
own
mother
must
be
so
utterly
parted
from
him
i
was
determined
that
she
should
have
at
least
the
poor
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
and
i
plotted
and
schemed
to
contrive
a
meeting
i
decided
that
on
the
night
of
the
beacon
fire
i
might
manage
to
carry
ronnie
away
for
a
few
minutes
so
as
to
give
the
opportunity
we
wanted
i
cajoled
him
with
promises
of
fairies
and
persuaded
him
quite
easily
to
go
with
me
to
find
them
father
who
was
as
anxious
and
excited
as
mother
was
waiting
with
a
boat
but
you
know
the
rest
for
you
followed
us
perhaps
trevellyan
suspected
something
she
must
have
known
shortly
afterwards
for
she
recognized
father
when
he
rescued
ronnie
on
the
cliff
i
heard
her
call
him
by
his
name
father
used
to
be
her
favourite
nephew
indeed
he
was
almost
like
a
son
to
her
but
she
had
believed
him
guilty
and
had
told
him
never
to
show
his
face
to
her
again
even
before
squire
trevellyan
death
there
had
already
been
an
estrangement
between
them
because
of
his
marriage
my
mother
was
not
their
choice
and
on
this
account
trevellyan
objected
to
her
and
only
once
consented
to
meet
her
though
father
sometimes
went
to
the
castle
to
visit
his
uncle
and
aunt
my
mother
and
i
were
never
invited
there
and
trevellyan
had
not
seen
ronnie
until
she
adopted
him
after
the
beacon
fire
i
felt
i
had
accomplished
one
part
at
least
of
my
mission
at
school
mother
had
seen
and
kissed
her
boy
and
she
seemed
a
little
comforted
and
cheered
in
consequence
but
the
greater
task
which
i
had
set
myself
that
of
clearing
my
father
name
was
still
untouched
one
possible
clue
there
was
which
i
thought
i
might
follow
up
do
you
remember
how
in
february
we
went
to
forster
folly
i
knew
that
forster
had
been
the
lawyer
who
drew
up
squire
will
and
the
famous
codicil
that
was
the
reason
why
i
was
so
anxious
to
go
into
the
house
and
so
excited
when
we
found
those
letters
lying
about
upstairs
i
would
have
stayed
to
look
at
them
if
i
had
dared
you
deirdre
tore
off
a
scrap
of
a
letter
with
a
crest
on
it
to
take
for
your
collection
now
that
crest
was
the
boar
head
of
the
trevellyans
which
i
knew
very
well
for
it
used
to
be
on
our
own
before
our
trouble
came
you
had
torn
the
piece
from
the
rest
of
the
letter
but
i
could
read
forst
c
and
on
turning
the
scrap
over
i
found
on
the
other
side
to
codi
could
it
be
possible
i
speculated
that
this
was
a
portion
of
an
original
letter
sent
by
squire
trevellyan
to
forster
asking
him
to
come
to
the
house
as
he
wished
to
make
an
extra
codicil
to
his
will
if
that
were
really
so
it
would
make
a
most
important
piece
of
evidence
i
begged
you
to
give
me
the
crest
but
you
would
not
part
with
it
then
and
locked
it
up
i
was
most
anxious
to
go
to
forster
folly
again
and
try
to
find
the
rest
of
the
letter
but
i
never
found
an
opportunity
until
last
week
it
was
too
far
to
venture
in
our
recreation
time
and
i
dare
not
be
absent
from
school
for
hours
without
leave
i
would
have
told
mother
and
asked
her
to
go
but
there
were
two
reasons
against
this
we
feared
she
might
be
known
to
the
police
and
that
they
would
watch
her
so
as
to
obtain
some
clue
to
my
father
whereabouts
so
she
did
not
wish
to
venture
into
cornwall
while
he
was
near
the
coast
when
she
came
to
see
ronnie
she
went
over
first
to
france
and
our
friend
fetched
her
from
there
in
the
yacht
and
took
her
back
to
malo
so
that
she
need
not
be
seen
on
the
railway
my
second
reason
was
that
until
i
could
be
sure
that
the
other
part
of
the
letter
really
contained
what
i
expected
it
seemed
cruel
to
raise
false
hopes
if
you
had
seen
as
i
have
the
bitter
bitter
tragedy
of
my
parents
lives
you
would
understand
how
i
wanted
to
spare
them
a
disappointment
so
i
waited
and
waited
and
at
last
my
opportunity
came
circumstances
were
kind
and
when
we
had
our
whole
day
holiday
i
was
chosen
as
a
hare
oh
how
rejoiced
i
was
when
you
decided
to
go
past
the
windmill
to
kergoff
i
was
determined
to
put
in
a
visit
somehow
to
the
old
house
but
it
came
so
naturally
when
we
needed
more
paper
to
my
intense
delight
i
found
the
other
portion
of
the
letter
that
i
wanted
and
then
you
were
kind
and
gave
me
the
scrap
with
the
crest
the
two
fit
exactly
together
look
i
will
show
you
this
is
what
they
make
when
joined
castle
forster
come
morning
about
eleven
if
you
can
make
that
convenient
as
i
want
to
consult
you
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
those
victoria
mine
shares
have
gone
up
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
and
i
thinking
of
selling
out
now
and
clearing
what
i
can
they
make
a
difference
to
my
estate
and
to
meet
this
i
wish
to
add
an
extra
codicil
to
my
will
is
here
so
you
will
see
him
i
have
not
been
well
a
touch
of
the
old
heart
trouble
i
am
afraid
i
must
ask
jones
to
arrange
for
me
to
consult
a
london
specialist
if
you
can
not
come
morning
please
arrange
saturday
yours
trevellyan
this
is
very
strong
evidence
that
squire
trevellyan
intended
making
the
codicil
to
his
will
i
am
longing
to
show
it
to
father
and
mother
but
they
are
both
away
cruising
in
the
yacht
i
do
know
where
they
are
now
they
promised
to
send
me
word
when
it
was
safe
for
me
to
write
to
them
when
we
began
to
hear
those
strange
noises
in
the
barred
room
and
yesterday
you
discovered
the
secret
of
its
entrance
i
was
dreadfully
alarmed
i
thought
my
father
must
have
come
back
again
in
spite
of
my
warnings
that
the
cave
was
unsafe
i
felt
so
nervous
and
uneasy
that
at
last
i
decided
to
go
and
see
for
myself
and
beg
him
not
to
stay
when
i
reached
the
entrance
however
i
did
not
dare
to
go
in
alone
in
case
it
should
be
somebody
else
instead
of
my
father
who
was
there
i
reproached
myself
for
my
cowardice
but
i
was
only
just
screwing
my
courage
to
the
point
when
you
two
arrived
with
miss
birks
i
need
not
tell
you
how
relieved
i
was
when
we
did
not
find
my
father
you
saw
my
frantic
excitement
when
it
turned
out
that
the
tramp
whom
we
discovered
was
no
other
than
abel
galsworthy
the
missing
witness
to
the
will
with
his
oath
and
this
precious
precious
letter
the
evidence
ought
to
be
complete
oh
the
rapture
of
the
day
when
father
name
is
cleared
and
his
honour
restored
and
he
can
live
anywhere
he
likes
openly
and
without
fear
now
i
have
told
you
my
whole
story
i
sure
you
see
why
i
was
so
queer
and
secretive
and
so
different
from
other
girls
we
understand
and
sympathize
now
said
deirdre
but
you
puzzled
us
very
much
at
the
time
we
thought
you
were
a
german
spy
chuckled
dulcie
we
were
going
to
get
great
credit
by
finding
out
your
wicked
plot
against
england
and
informing
the
government
had
you
anything
to
do
with
that
man
in
the
aeroplane
why
i
almost
forgotten
him
exclaimed
deirdre
i
never
even
knew
there
was
an
aeroplane
here
protested
gerda
you
have
told
us
your
real
name
yet
urged
dulcie
mary
gerda
trevellyan
father
and
mother
have
always
called
me
mamie
but
i
like
gerda
best
and
when
i
came
to
school
i
begged
to
be
thorwaldson
so
that
part
at
least
of
my
name
was
genuine
were
you
afraid
that
trevellyan
might
discover
you
through
that
she
had
always
heard
me
alluded
to
as
mamie
we
thought
she
had
probably
quite
forgotten
the
there
one
thing
i
still
ca
understand
said
dulcie
we
found
out
the
entrance
to
the
barred
room
but
why
was
it
ever
barred
it
seems
so
extraordinary
right
in
the
middle
of
a
school
i
can
explain
that
too
returned
gerda
father
has
often
told
me
the
story
years
and
years
ago
squire
and
trevellyan
had
one
only
child
a
little
girl
named
lillie
father
was
very
fond
of
this
cousin
and
they
were
almost
like
brother
and
sister
together
then
when
she
was
ten
years
old
she
died
at
that
time
they
were
living
at
the
dower
house
because
alterations
were
being
made
at
the
castle
her
death
was
very
sudden
she
was
only
ill
a
few
hours
one
day
she
was
laughing
and
playing
about
and
on
the
next
she
was
dead
her
poor
father
and
mother
were
simply
they
took
her
toys
and
all
her
little
treasures
and
put
them
in
her
bedroom
which
they
left
just
as
if
she
were
going
to
occupy
it
still
then
they
locked
up
the
door
and
barred
it
and
declared
that
during
their
lifetime
nobody
should
ever
enter
it
was
to
be
sacred
to
lillie
and
no
one
else
must
use
it
my
father
of
course
knew
about
it
and
he
also
knew
of
the
secret
passage
an
old
smuggler
way
that
led
into
it
from
the
cave
the
door
of
this
passage
had
been
carefully
nailed
up
before
lillie
used
the
room
but
he
had
heard
that
it
opened
over
the
fireplace
in
his
desperate
need
of
a
safe
shelter
he
remembered
this
place
came
up
the
passage
then
forced
the
door
and
found
his
way
into
the
room
he
said
it
was
surely
no
crime
for
cousin
lillie
had
been
fond
of
him
and
always
ready
to
screen
him
in
his
boyish
days
so
he
thought
if
she
could
know
she
would
be
glad
for
him
to
use
what
had
once
been
hers
i
have
asked
half
all
yet
persisted
dulcie
do
you
remember
when
first
you
came
to
school
we
all
tried
our
luck
at
perran
well
and
you
were
the
only
one
who
did
the
right
things
and
whose
stick
floated
away
how
did
you
manage
it
gerda
smiled
father
had
often
told
me
about
the
well
and
the
exact
way
to
perform
perran
ceremony
he
used
to
try
it
with
lillie
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
said
half
the
secret
was
to
unstop
the
channel
above
the
spring
my
wish
was
that
i
might
clear
his
name
so
you
see
it
came
true
though
at
the
time
it
seemed
as
unlikely
as
flying
in
an
aeroplane
to
america
you
put
a
message
in
a
bottle
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
for
your
father
said
deirdre
you
did
know
dulcie
and
i
fished
it
out
oh
did
you
said
gerda
reproachfully
then
that
was
the
letter
he
never
received
gerda
discovery
in
abel
galsworthy
of
the
missing
witness
for
whom
such
long
search
had
been
made
was
certainly
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
for
that
worthy
instead
of
being
handed
over
to
the
police
and
prosecuted
for
trespassing
and
pilfering
he
found
himself
provided
with
new
clothes
comfortably
lodged
in
the
village
and
given
a
promise
of
work
when
his
important
part
in
the
law
proceedings
should
be
over
at
present
he
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
for
on
his
word
alone
hung
trevellyan
honour
as
the
other
witness
and
the
lawyer
were
both
dead
his
oath
to
his
signature
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
the
genuineness
of
the
codicil
there
were
of
course
elaborate
legal
proceedings
to
be
taken
trevellyan
appealed
for
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
in
the
former
trial
and
the
case
would
have
to
wait
its
turn
before
it
could
come
before
the
court
as
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
was
still
technically
in
force
he
was
obliged
to
continue
living
on
the
yacht
until
his
innocence
had
been
officially
recognized
a
state
of
affairs
that
greatly
roused
gerda
indignation
though
miss
birks
preached
patience
i
wanted
father
and
mother
to
come
to
the
she
lamented
these
legal
difficulties
can
not
be
rolled
away
in
a
few
days
said
miss
birks
let
us
be
thankful
that
we
can
count
upon
success
later
on
now
that
gerda
no
longer
needed
to
hide
a
tragic
secret
her
whole
behaviour
at
the
dower
house
had
altered
and
her
schoolfellows
hardly
recognized
in
the
merry
genial
sociable
companion
which
she
now
proved
the
silent
recluse
who
had
given
her
confidence
to
nobody
in
this
fresh
attitude
she
was
highly
popular
the
romance
of
her
story
appealed
to
the
girls
and
they
were
anxious
to
make
up
to
her
for
having
misjudged
her
also
they
greatly
appreciated
her
capacity
for
fun
and
humour
gerda
never
made
one
solitary
joke
before
and
now
she
keeps
us
laughing
all
day
said
betty
scott
how
could
she
laugh
when
she
was
carrying
that
terrible
burden
all
the
time
commented
jessie
macpherson
poor
child
no
wonder
different
now
the
shadow
removed
from
her
life
we
have
ripping
fun
with
her
next
term
anticipated
annie
pridwell
meanwhile
very
little
of
the
old
term
was
left
the
dreaded
examination
week
arrived
bringing
harvey
james
to
test
those
who
were
to
undergo
the
piano
ordeal
and
leonard
pearce
to
criticize
the
artistic
efforts
in
the
other
subjects
there
were
written
papers
which
were
corrected
and
judged
by
the
donors
of
the
prizes
in
spite
of
much
apprehension
on
the
part
of
the
girls
harvey
james
made
a
good
impression
and
did
not
turn
out
to
be
the
strict
martinet
they
expected
indeed
he
commented
so
kindly
and
so
helpfully
on
their
playing
that
they
began
to
look
forward
to
their
lessons
with
him
during
the
forthcoming
autumn
the
art
class
spent
a
delightful
though
anxious
afternoon
sketching
a
group
of
picturesque
eastern
pots
artistically
grouped
by
leonard
pearce
who
was
kind
and
charitable
in
his
criticisms
of
their
little
exhibition
of
paintings
hung
in
the
big
classroom
to
their
delight
he
finished
his
visit
by
himself
making
a
study
of
the
pots
while
they
stood
round
and
watched
his
clever
brush
dabbing
on
the
colour
with
swift
and
skilful
strokes
miss
birks
is
going
to
have
his
sketch
framed
said
deirdre
appreciatively
when
he
had
gone
i
wish
he
could
teach
us
every
week
declared
the
art
enthusiasts
ah
you
see
he
lives
in
london
and
only
comes
to
cornwall
sometimes
for
a
holiday
but
miss
birks
has
promised
to
get
an
artist
next
summer
to
give
us
sketching
lessons
one
advantage
of
the
smallness
of
the
school
was
that
it
was
not
a
lengthy
matter
to
correct
the
examination
papers
of
only
twenty
pupils
that
work
was
soon
over
and
the
girls
had
not
long
to
remain
in
suspense
before
the
lists
were
ready
the
annual
was
always
the
occasion
of
a
social
gathering
some
of
the
girls
parents
came
down
for
it
and
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
were
invited
if
the
weather
were
favourable
it
was
generally
held
in
the
garden
and
this
time
the
sky
being
cloudless
all
arrangements
had
been
made
on
the
lawn
where
the
gardener
had
erected
a
temporary
platform
it
seemed
a
great
day
to
gerda
as
she
came
downstairs
in
her
white
dress
and
watched
the
company
that
was
already
beginning
to
arrive
if
only
her
father
and
mother
could
have
been
numbered
among
the
guests
her
bliss
would
have
been
complete
ronnie
however
was
running
in
and
out
like
a
sunbeam
and
her
aunt
had
spoken
to
her
and
had
been
kindness
itself
we
must
all
let
bygones
be
bygones
now
my
dear
and
rejoice
together
at
this
happy
ending
of
our
troubles
said
trevellyan
i
hope
you
will
soon
come
to
know
the
castle
as
well
as
ronnie
does
and
feel
equally
at
home
there
most
of
the
prizes
fell
exactly
as
had
been
expected
jessie
macpherson
won
the
lion
share
in
the
sixth
hilda
marriott
scored
the
record
for
va
and
barbara
marshall
and
romola
harvey
divided
the
honours
of
vb
deirdre
got
highly
commended
for
both
music
and
drawing
but
dulcie
despite
her
valorous
spurt
at
the
finish
had
no
luck
she
was
only
too
delighted
however
to
find
that
the
prize
for
which
she
had
tried
that
for
general
improvement
had
been
awarded
to
gerda
she
deserves
it
if
anyone
does
she
whispered
to
deirdre
i
say
dare
we
start
three
cheers
for
her
we
risk
it
returned
deirdre
augmenting
the
applause
by
a
vigorous
hooray
which
was
at
once
taken
up
by
the
entire
school
gerda
red
as
a
rose
walked
back
from
the
platform
blushing
now
with
real
bashfulness
instead
of
her
old
nervous
apprehension
ronnie
was
waving
his
little
hat
and
shouting
the
shrillest
of
cheers
and
trevellyan
was
clapping
her
best
ave
ave
winner
of
general
improvement
exclaimed
the
members
of
vb
as
they
welcomed
her
back
to
their
particular
bench
miss
birks
could
have
given
it
better
gerda
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
glad
if
you
do
find
me
improved
she
said
it
ever
so
nice
of
you
to
be
kind
to
me
now
i
was
horrid
before
and
i
knew
it
but
i
could
help
it
we
understand
exactly
sympathized
the
girls
there
is
very
little
more
of
our
story
left
to
be
told
trevellyan
won
his
case
and
successfully
proved
his
innocence
to
the
whole
world
restored
to
good
name
and
fortune
he
has
taken
overdale
a
pretty
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pontperran
which
happened
to
be
to
let
gerda
continues
a
pupil
at
the
dower
house
though
she
is
often
able
to
visit
her
own
home
ronnie
while
he
will
see
his
aunt
every
day
is
to
live
with
his
parents
a
fitting
and
also
a
very
salutary
arrangement
for
he
is
no
longer
a
baby
and
was
growing
too
much
for
trevellyan
and
miss
herbert
powers
of
management
the
little
fellow
respects
his
father
authority
and
will
run
far
less
risk
of
getting
spoilt
than
when
he
was
king
of
the
castle
in
a
year
or
two
the
young
rascal
will
be
old
enough
for
school
said
trevellyan
and
in
the
meantime
he
must
get
to
know
his
mother
and
me
gerda
is
immensely
delighted
with
her
new
home
and
very
proud
to
take
school
friends
there
