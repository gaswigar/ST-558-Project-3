ah
madame
replied
the
doctor
i
have
some
appalling
stories
in
my
collection
but
each
one
has
its
proper
hour
in
a
know
the
pretty
jest
recorded
by
chamfort
and
said
to
the
duc
de
fronsac
between
your
sally
and
the
present
moment
lie
ten
bottles
of
but
it
is
two
in
the
morning
and
the
story
of
rosina
has
prepared
us
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
tell
us
monsieur
bianchon
was
the
cry
on
every
side
the
obliging
doctor
bowed
and
silence
reigned
at
about
a
hundred
paces
from
vendôme
on
the
banks
of
the
loir
said
he
stands
an
old
brown
house
crowned
with
very
high
roofs
and
so
completely
isolated
that
there
is
nothing
near
it
not
even
a
fetid
tannery
or
a
squalid
tavern
such
as
are
commonly
seen
outside
small
towns
in
front
of
this
house
is
a
garden
down
to
the
river
where
the
box
shrubs
formerly
clipped
close
to
edge
the
walks
now
straggle
at
their
own
will
a
few
willows
rooted
in
the
stream
have
grown
up
quickly
like
an
enclosing
fence
and
half
hide
the
house
the
wild
plants
we
call
weeds
have
clothed
the
bank
with
their
beautiful
luxuriance
the
neglected
for
these
ten
years
past
no
longer
bear
a
crop
and
their
suckers
have
formed
a
thicket
the
espaliers
are
like
a
copse
the
paths
once
graveled
are
overgrown
with
purslane
but
to
be
accurate
there
is
no
trace
of
a
path
looking
down
from
the
hilltop
to
which
cling
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
of
the
dukes
of
vendôme
the
only
spot
whence
the
eye
can
see
into
this
enclosure
we
think
that
at
a
time
difficult
now
to
determine
this
spot
of
earth
must
have
been
the
joy
of
some
country
gentleman
devoted
to
roses
and
tulips
in
a
word
to
horticulture
but
above
all
a
lover
of
choice
fruit
an
arbor
is
visible
or
rather
the
wreck
of
an
arbor
and
under
it
a
table
still
stands
not
entirely
destroyed
by
time
at
the
aspect
of
this
garden
that
is
no
more
the
negative
joys
of
the
peaceful
life
of
the
provinces
may
be
divined
as
we
divine
the
history
of
a
worthy
tradesman
when
we
read
the
epitaph
on
his
tomb
to
complete
the
mournful
and
tender
impressions
which
seize
the
soul
on
one
of
the
walls
there
is
a
sundial
graced
with
this
homely
christian
motto
ultimam
the
roof
of
this
house
is
dreadfully
dilapidated
the
outside
shutters
are
always
closed
the
balconies
are
hung
with
swallows
nests
the
doors
are
for
ever
shut
straggling
grasses
have
outlined
the
flagstones
of
the
steps
with
green
the
ironwork
is
rusty
moon
and
sun
winter
summer
and
snow
have
eaten
into
the
wood
warped
the
boards
peeled
off
the
paint
the
dreary
silence
is
broken
only
by
birds
and
cats
polecats
rats
and
mice
free
to
scamper
round
and
fight
and
eat
each
other
an
invisible
hand
has
written
over
it
all
if
prompted
by
curiosity
you
go
to
look
at
this
house
from
the
street
you
will
see
a
large
gate
with
a
top
the
children
have
made
many
holes
in
it
i
learned
later
that
this
door
had
been
blocked
for
ten
years
through
these
irregular
breaches
you
will
see
that
the
side
towards
the
courtyard
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
side
towards
the
garden
the
same
ruin
prevails
tufts
of
weeds
outline
the
the
walls
are
scored
by
enormous
cracks
and
the
blackened
coping
is
laced
with
a
thousand
festoons
of
pellitory
the
stone
steps
are
disjointed
the
is
rotten
the
broken
what
fire
from
heaven
could
have
fallen
there
by
what
decree
has
salt
been
sown
on
this
dwelling
has
god
been
mocked
here
or
was
france
betrayed
these
are
the
questions
we
ask
ourselves
reptiles
crawl
over
it
but
give
no
reply
this
empty
and
deserted
house
is
a
vast
enigma
of
which
the
answer
is
known
to
none
it
was
formerly
a
little
domain
held
in
fief
and
is
known
as
la
grande
bretèche
during
my
stay
at
vendôme
where
despleins
had
left
me
in
charge
of
a
rich
patient
the
sight
of
this
strange
dwelling
became
one
of
my
keenest
pleasures
was
it
not
far
better
than
a
ruin
certain
memories
of
indisputable
authenticity
attach
themselves
to
a
ruin
but
this
house
still
standing
though
being
slowly
destroyed
by
an
avenging
hand
contained
a
secret
an
unrevealed
thought
at
the
very
least
it
testified
to
a
caprice
more
than
once
in
the
evening
i
boarded
the
hedge
run
wild
which
surrounded
the
enclosure
i
braved
scratches
i
got
into
this
ownerless
garden
this
plot
which
was
no
longer
public
or
private
i
lingered
there
for
hours
gazing
at
the
disorder
i
would
not
as
the
price
of
the
story
to
which
this
strange
scene
no
doubt
was
due
have
asked
a
single
question
of
any
gossiping
native
on
that
spot
i
wove
delightful
romances
and
abandoned
myself
to
little
debauches
of
melancholy
which
enchanted
me
if
i
had
known
the
quite
this
neglect
i
should
have
lost
the
unwritten
poetry
which
intoxicated
me
to
me
this
refuge
represented
the
most
various
phases
of
human
life
shadowed
by
misfortune
sometimes
the
peace
of
the
graveyard
without
the
dead
who
speak
in
the
language
of
epitaphs
one
day
i
saw
in
it
the
home
of
lepers
another
the
house
of
the
atridae
but
above
all
i
found
there
provincial
life
with
its
contemplative
ideas
its
existence
i
often
wept
there
i
never
laughed
more
than
once
i
felt
involuntary
terrors
as
i
heard
overhead
the
dull
hum
of
the
wings
of
some
hurrying
the
earth
is
dank
you
must
be
on
the
watch
for
lizards
vipers
and
frogs
wandering
about
with
the
wild
freedom
of
nature
above
all
you
must
have
no
fear
of
cold
for
in
a
few
moments
you
feel
an
icy
cloak
settle
on
your
shoulders
like
the
commendatore
s
hand
on
don
giovanni
s
neck
one
evening
i
felt
a
shudder
the
wind
had
turned
an
old
rusty
weathercock
and
the
creaking
sounded
like
a
cry
from
the
house
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
finishing
a
gloomy
drama
to
account
for
this
monumental
embodiment
of
woe
i
returned
to
my
inn
lost
in
gloomy
thoughts
when
i
had
supped
the
hostess
came
into
my
room
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
said
monsieur
here
is
monsieur
who
is
monsieur
regnault
what
sir
do
you
not
know
monsieur
regnault
that
s
odd
said
she
leaving
the
room
on
a
sudden
i
saw
a
man
appear
tall
slim
dressed
in
black
hat
in
hand
who
came
in
like
a
ram
ready
to
butt
his
opponent
showing
a
receding
forehead
a
small
pointed
head
and
a
colorless
face
of
the
hue
of
a
glass
of
dirty
water
you
would
have
taken
him
for
an
usher
the
stranger
wore
an
old
coat
much
worn
at
the
seams
but
he
had
a
diamond
in
his
shirt
frill
and
gold
rings
in
his
ears
monsieur
said
i
whom
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
took
a
chair
placed
himself
in
front
of
my
fire
put
his
hat
on
my
table
and
answered
while
he
rubbed
his
hands
dear
me
it
is
very
i
am
monsieur
i
was
encouraging
myself
by
saying
to
myself
seek
i
am
he
went
on
notary
at
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
monsieur
i
exclaimed
but
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
make
a
will
for
reasons
best
known
to
one
moment
said
he
holding
up
his
hand
as
though
to
gain
silence
allow
me
monsieur
allow
me
i
am
informed
that
you
sometimes
go
to
walk
in
the
garden
of
la
grande
yes
one
moment
said
he
repeating
his
gesture
that
constitutes
a
misdemeanor
monsieur
as
executor
under
the
will
of
the
late
comtesse
de
merret
i
come
in
her
name
to
beg
you
to
discontinue
the
practice
one
moment
i
am
not
a
turk
and
do
not
wish
to
make
a
crime
of
it
and
besides
you
are
free
to
be
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
which
compel
me
to
leave
the
finest
mansion
in
vendôme
to
fall
into
ruin
nevertheless
monsieur
you
must
be
a
man
of
education
and
you
should
know
that
the
laws
forbid
under
heavy
penalties
any
trespass
on
enclosed
property
a
hedge
is
the
same
as
a
wall
but
the
state
in
which
the
place
is
left
may
be
an
excuse
for
your
curiosity
for
my
part
i
should
be
quite
content
to
make
you
free
to
come
and
go
in
the
house
but
being
bound
to
respect
the
will
of
the
testatrix
i
have
the
honor
monsieur
to
beg
that
you
will
go
into
the
garden
no
more
i
myself
monsieur
since
the
will
was
read
have
never
set
foot
in
the
house
which
as
i
had
the
honor
of
informing
you
is
part
of
the
estate
of
the
late
madame
de
merret
we
have
done
nothing
there
but
verify
the
number
of
doors
and
windows
to
assess
the
taxes
i
have
to
pay
annually
out
of
the
funds
left
for
that
purpose
by
the
late
madame
de
merret
ah
my
dear
sir
her
will
made
a
great
commotion
in
the
the
good
man
paused
to
blow
his
nose
i
respected
his
volubility
perfectly
understanding
that
the
administration
of
madame
de
merret
s
estate
had
been
the
most
important
event
of
his
life
his
reputation
his
glory
his
restoration
as
i
was
forced
to
bid
farewell
to
my
beautiful
reveries
and
romances
i
was
to
reject
learning
the
truth
on
official
authority
monsieur
said
i
would
it
be
indiscreet
if
i
were
to
ask
you
the
reasons
for
such
eccentricity
at
these
words
an
expression
which
revealed
all
the
pleasure
which
men
feel
who
are
accustomed
to
ride
a
hobby
overspread
the
lawyer
s
countenance
he
pulled
up
the
collar
of
his
shirt
with
an
air
took
out
his
snuffbox
opened
it
and
offered
me
a
pinch
on
my
refusing
he
took
a
large
one
he
was
happy
a
man
who
has
no
hobby
does
not
know
all
the
good
to
be
got
out
of
life
a
hobby
is
the
happy
medium
between
a
passion
and
a
monomania
at
this
moment
i
understood
the
whole
bearing
of
sterne
s
charming
passion
and
had
a
perfect
idea
of
the
delight
with
which
my
uncle
toby
encouraged
by
trim
bestrode
his
monsieur
said
monsieur
regnault
i
was
in
monsieur
roguin
s
office
in
paris
a
house
which
you
may
have
heard
mentioned
no
an
unfortunate
bankruptcy
made
it
having
money
enough
to
purchase
a
practice
in
paris
at
the
price
to
which
they
were
run
up
in
i
came
here
and
bought
my
predecessor
s
business
i
had
relations
in
vendôme
among
others
a
wealthy
aunt
who
allowed
me
to
marry
her
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
three
months
after
being
licensed
by
the
keeper
of
the
seals
one
evening
as
i
was
going
to
was
before
my
was
sent
for
by
madame
la
comtesse
de
merret
to
her
chateau
of
merret
her
maid
a
good
girl
who
is
now
a
servant
in
this
inn
was
waiting
at
my
door
with
the
countess
own
carriage
ah
one
moment
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
monsieur
le
comte
de
merret
had
gone
to
paris
to
die
two
months
before
i
came
here
he
came
to
a
miserable
end
flinging
himself
into
every
kind
of
dissipation
you
understand
on
the
day
when
he
left
madame
la
comtesse
had
quitted
la
grand
bretèche
having
dismantled
it
some
people
even
say
that
she
had
burnt
all
the
furniture
the
short
all
the
chattels
and
furniture
whatever
used
in
furnishing
the
premises
now
let
by
the
said
dear
what
am
i
saying
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
i
was
dictating
a
lease
short
that
she
burnt
everything
in
the
meadow
at
merret
have
you
been
to
merret
monsieur
said
he
answering
himself
ah
it
is
a
very
fine
for
about
three
months
previously
he
went
on
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
the
count
and
countess
had
lived
in
a
very
eccentric
way
they
admitted
no
visitors
madame
lived
on
the
and
monsieur
on
the
first
floor
when
the
countess
was
left
alone
she
was
never
seen
excepting
at
church
subsequently
at
home
at
the
chateau
she
refused
to
see
the
friends
whether
gentlemen
or
ladies
who
went
to
call
on
her
she
was
already
very
much
altered
when
she
left
la
grande
bretèche
to
go
to
merret
that
dear
say
dear
lady
for
it
was
she
who
gave
me
this
diamond
but
indeed
i
saw
her
but
kind
lady
was
very
ill
she
had
no
doubt
given
up
all
hope
for
she
died
without
choosing
to
send
for
a
doctor
indeed
many
of
our
ladies
fancied
she
was
not
quite
right
in
her
head
well
sir
my
curiosity
was
strangely
excited
by
hearing
that
madame
de
merret
had
need
of
my
services
nor
was
i
the
only
person
who
took
an
interest
in
the
affair
that
very
night
though
it
was
already
late
all
the
town
knew
that
i
was
going
to
merret
the
replied
but
vaguely
to
the
questions
i
asked
her
on
the
way
nevertheless
she
told
me
that
her
mistress
had
received
the
sacrament
in
the
course
of
the
day
at
the
hands
of
the
curé
of
merret
and
seemed
unlikely
to
live
through
the
night
it
was
about
eleven
when
i
reached
the
chateau
i
went
up
the
great
staircase
after
crossing
some
large
lofty
dark
rooms
diabolically
cold
and
damp
i
reached
the
state
bedroom
where
the
countess
lay
from
the
rumors
that
were
current
concerning
this
lady
monsieur
i
should
never
end
if
i
were
to
repeat
all
the
tales
that
were
told
about
her
i
had
imagined
her
a
coquette
imagine
then
that
i
had
great
difficulty
in
seeing
her
in
the
great
bed
where
she
was
lying
to
be
sure
to
light
this
enormous
room
with
heavy
cornices
and
so
thick
with
dust
that
merely
to
see
it
was
enough
to
make
you
sneeze
she
had
only
an
old
argand
lamp
ah
but
you
have
not
been
to
merret
well
the
bed
is
one
of
those
old
world
beds
with
a
high
tester
hung
with
flowered
chintz
a
small
table
stood
by
the
bed
on
which
i
saw
an
imitation
of
christ
which
by
the
way
i
bought
for
my
wife
as
well
as
the
lamp
there
were
also
a
deep
armchair
for
her
confidential
maid
and
two
small
chairs
there
was
no
fire
that
was
all
the
furniture
not
enough
to
fill
ten
lines
in
an
inventory
my
dear
sir
if
you
had
seen
as
i
then
saw
that
vast
room
papered
and
hung
with
brown
you
would
have
felt
yourself
transported
into
a
scene
of
a
romance
it
was
icy
nay
more
funereal
and
he
lifted
his
hand
with
a
theatrical
gesture
and
paused
by
dint
of
seeking
as
i
approached
the
bed
at
last
i
saw
madame
de
merret
under
the
glimmer
of
the
lamp
which
fell
on
the
pillows
her
face
was
as
yellow
as
wax
and
as
narrow
as
two
folded
hands
the
countess
had
a
lace
cap
showing
her
abundant
hair
but
as
white
as
linen
thread
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
seemed
to
keep
upright
with
great
difficulty
her
large
black
eyes
dimmed
by
fever
no
doubt
and
already
hardly
moved
under
the
bony
arch
of
her
he
added
pointing
to
his
own
brow
her
forehead
was
clammy
her
fleshless
hands
were
like
bones
covered
with
soft
skin
the
veins
and
muscles
were
perfectly
visible
she
must
have
been
very
handsome
but
at
this
moment
i
was
startled
into
an
indescribable
emotion
at
the
sight
never
said
those
who
wrapped
her
in
her
shroud
had
any
living
creature
been
so
emaciated
and
lived
in
short
it
was
awful
to
behold
sickness
so
consumed
that
woman
that
she
was
no
more
than
a
phantom
her
lips
which
were
pale
violet
seemed
to
me
not
to
move
when
she
spoke
to
me
though
my
profession
has
familiarized
me
with
such
spectacles
by
calling
me
not
infrequently
to
the
bedside
of
the
dying
to
record
their
last
wishes
i
confess
that
families
in
tears
and
the
agonies
i
have
seen
were
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
lonely
and
silent
woman
in
her
vast
chateau
i
heard
not
the
least
sound
i
did
not
perceive
the
movement
which
the
sufferer
s
breathing
ought
to
have
given
to
the
sheets
that
covered
her
and
i
stood
motionless
absorbed
in
looking
at
her
in
a
sort
of
stupor
in
fancy
i
am
there
still
at
last
her
large
eyes
moved
she
tried
to
raise
her
right
hand
but
it
fell
back
on
the
bed
and
she
uttered
these
words
which
came
like
a
breath
for
her
voice
was
no
longer
a
voice
i
have
waited
for
you
with
the
greatest
a
bright
flush
rose
to
her
cheeks
it
was
a
great
effort
to
her
to
speak
madame
i
began
she
signed
to
me
to
be
silent
at
that
moment
the
old
housekeeper
rose
and
said
in
my
ear
do
not
speak
madame
la
comtesse
is
not
in
a
state
to
bear
the
slightest
noise
and
what
you
say
might
agitate
i
sat
down
a
few
instants
after
madame
de
merret
collected
all
her
remaining
strength
to
move
her
right
hand
and
slipped
it
not
without
infinite
difficulty
under
the
bolster
she
then
paused
a
moment
with
a
last
effort
she
withdrew
her
hand
and
when
she
brought
out
a
sealed
paper
drops
of
perspiration
rolled
from
her
brow
i
place
my
will
in
your
god
oh
and
that
was
all
she
clutched
a
crucifix
that
lay
on
the
bed
lifted
it
hastily
to
her
lips
and
died
the
expression
of
her
eyes
still
makes
me
shudder
as
i
think
of
it
she
must
have
suffered
much
there
was
joy
in
her
last
glance
and
it
remained
stamped
on
her
dead
eyes
i
brought
away
the
will
and
when
it
was
opened
i
found
that
madame
de
merret
had
appointed
me
her
executor
she
left
the
whole
of
her
property
to
the
hospital
at
vendôme
excepting
a
few
legacies
but
these
were
her
instructions
as
relating
to
la
grande
bretèche
she
ordered
me
to
leave
the
place
for
fifty
years
counting
from
the
day
of
her
death
in
the
state
in
which
it
might
be
at
the
time
of
her
death
forbidding
any
one
whoever
he
might
be
to
enter
the
apartments
prohibiting
any
repairs
whatever
and
even
settling
a
salary
to
pay
watchmen
if
it
were
needful
to
secure
the
absolute
fulfilment
of
her
intentions
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
if
the
will
of
the
testatrix
has
been
duly
carried
out
the
house
is
to
become
the
property
of
my
heirs
for
as
you
know
a
notary
can
not
take
a
bequest
otherwise
la
grande
bretèche
reverts
to
the
but
on
condition
of
fulfilling
certain
conditions
set
forth
in
a
codicil
to
the
will
which
is
not
to
be
opened
till
the
expiration
of
the
said
term
of
fifty
years
the
will
has
not
been
disputed
and
without
finishing
his
sentence
the
lanky
notary
looked
at
me
with
an
air
of
triumph
i
made
him
quite
happy
by
offering
him
my
congratulations
monsieur
i
said
in
conclusion
you
have
so
vividly
impressed
me
that
i
fancy
i
see
the
dying
woman
whiter
than
her
sheets
her
glittering
eyes
frighten
me
i
shall
dream
of
her
you
must
have
formed
some
idea
as
to
the
instructions
contained
in
that
extraordinary
monsieur
said
he
with
comical
reticence
i
never
allow
myself
to
criticise
the
conduct
of
a
person
who
honors
me
with
the
gift
of
a
however
i
soon
loosened
the
tongue
of
the
discreet
notary
of
vendôme
who
communicated
to
me
not
without
long
digressions
the
opinions
of
the
deep
politicians
of
both
sexes
whose
judgments
are
law
in
vendôme
but
these
opinions
were
so
contradictory
so
diffuse
that
i
was
near
falling
asleep
in
spite
of
the
interest
i
felt
in
this
authentic
history
the
notary
s
ponderous
voice
and
monotonous
accent
accustomed
no
doubt
to
listen
to
himself
and
to
make
himself
listened
to
by
his
clients
or
were
too
much
for
my
curiosity
happily
he
soon
went
away
ah
ha
monsieur
said
he
on
the
stairs
a
good
many
persons
would
be
glad
to
live
years
longer
moment
and
he
laid
the
first
finger
of
his
right
hand
to
his
nostril
with
a
cunning
look
as
much
as
to
say
mark
my
words
last
as
long
as
long
as
that
said
he
you
must
not
be
past
sixty
i
closed
my
door
having
been
roused
from
my
apathy
by
this
last
speech
which
the
notary
thought
very
funny
then
i
sat
down
in
my
armchair
with
my
feet
on
the
i
had
lost
myself
in
a
romance
à
la
radcliffe
constructed
on
the
juridical
base
given
me
by
monsieur
regnault
when
the
door
opened
by
a
woman
s
cautious
hand
turned
on
the
hinges
i
saw
my
landlady
come
in
a
buxom
florid
dame
always
who
had
missed
her
calling
in
life
she
was
a
fleming
who
ought
to
have
seen
the
light
in
a
picture
by
teniers
well
monsieur
said
she
monsieur
regnault
has
no
doubt
been
giving
you
his
history
of
la
grande
bretèche
yes
madame
and
what
did
he
tell
you
i
repeated
in
a
few
words
the
creepy
and
sinister
story
of
madame
de
merret
at
each
sentence
my
hostess
put
her
head
forward
looking
at
me
with
an
innkeeper
s
keen
scrutiny
a
happy
compromise
between
the
instinct
of
a
police
constable
the
astuteness
of
a
spy
and
the
cunning
of
a
dealer
my
good
madame
lepas
said
i
as
i
ended
you
seem
to
know
more
about
it
heh
if
not
why
have
you
come
up
to
me
on
my
word
as
an
honest
do
not
swear
your
eyes
are
big
with
a
secret
you
knew
monsieur
de
merret
what
sort
of
man
was
he
monsieur
de
you
see
he
was
a
man
you
never
could
see
the
top
of
he
was
so
tall
a
very
good
gentleman
from
picardy
and
who
had
as
we
say
his
head
close
to
his
cap
he
paid
for
everything
down
so
as
never
to
have
difficulties
with
any
one
he
was
you
see
all
our
ladies
liked
him
very
because
he
was
i
asked
her
well
may
be
said
she
and
you
may
suppose
sir
that
a
man
had
to
have
something
to
show
for
a
figurehead
before
he
could
marry
madame
de
merret
who
without
any
reflection
on
others
was
the
handsomest
and
richest
heiress
in
our
parts
she
had
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
all
the
town
was
at
the
wedding
the
bride
was
pretty
and
quite
a
gem
of
a
woman
oh
they
were
a
handsome
couple
in
their
day
and
were
they
happy
together
hm
hm
far
as
can
be
guessed
for
as
you
may
suppose
we
of
the
common
sort
were
not
with
de
merret
was
a
kind
woman
and
very
pleasant
who
had
no
doubt
sometimes
to
put
up
with
her
husband
s
tantrums
but
though
he
was
rather
haughty
we
were
fond
of
him
after
all
it
was
his
place
to
behave
so
when
a
man
is
a
born
nobleman
you
still
there
must
have
been
some
catastrophe
for
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
to
part
so
violently
i
did
not
say
there
was
any
catastrophe
sir
i
know
nothing
about
indeed
well
now
i
am
sure
you
know
well
sir
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
i
saw
monsieur
regnault
go
up
to
see
you
it
struck
me
that
he
would
speak
to
you
about
madame
de
merret
as
having
to
do
with
la
grande
bretèche
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
ask
your
advice
sir
seeming
to
me
that
you
are
a
man
of
good
judgment
and
incapable
of
playing
a
poor
woman
like
me
i
never
did
any
one
a
wrong
and
yet
i
am
tormented
by
my
conscience
up
to
now
i
have
never
dared
to
say
a
word
to
the
people
of
these
parts
they
are
all
with
tongues
like
knives
and
never
till
now
sir
have
i
had
any
traveler
here
who
stayed
so
long
in
the
inn
as
you
have
and
to
whom
i
could
tell
the
history
of
the
fifteen
thousand
my
dear
madame
lepas
if
there
is
anything
in
your
story
of
a
nature
to
compromise
me
i
said
interrupting
the
flow
of
her
words
i
would
not
hear
it
for
all
the
you
need
have
no
fears
said
she
you
will
her
eagerness
made
me
suspect
that
i
was
not
the
only
person
to
whom
my
worthy
landlady
had
communicated
the
secret
of
which
i
was
to
be
the
sole
possessor
but
i
listened
monsieur
said
she
when
the
emperor
sent
the
spaniards
here
prisoners
of
war
and
others
i
was
required
to
lodge
at
the
charge
of
the
government
a
young
spaniard
sent
to
vendôme
on
parole
notwithstanding
his
parole
he
had
to
show
himself
every
day
to
the
he
was
a
spanish
more
nor
less
he
had
a
name
in
os
and
dia
something
like
bagos
de
férédia
i
wrote
his
name
down
in
my
books
and
you
may
see
it
if
you
like
ah
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
for
a
spaniard
who
are
all
ugly
they
say
he
was
not
more
than
five
feet
two
or
three
in
height
but
so
well
made
and
he
had
little
hands
that
he
kept
so
beautifully
ah
you
should
have
seen
them
he
had
as
many
brushes
for
his
hands
as
a
woman
has
for
her
toilet
he
had
thick
black
hair
a
flame
in
his
eye
a
somewhat
coppery
complexion
but
which
i
admired
all
the
same
he
wore
the
finest
linen
i
have
ever
seen
though
i
have
had
princesses
to
lodge
here
and
among
others
general
bertrand
the
duc
and
duchesse
d
abrantes
monsieur
descazes
and
the
king
of
spain
he
did
not
eat
much
but
he
had
such
polite
and
amiable
ways
that
it
was
impossible
to
owe
him
a
grudge
for
that
oh
i
was
very
fond
of
him
though
he
did
not
say
four
words
to
me
in
a
day
and
it
was
impossible
to
have
the
least
bit
of
talk
with
him
if
he
was
spoken
to
he
did
not
answer
it
is
a
way
a
mania
they
all
have
it
would
seem
he
read
his
breviary
like
a
priest
and
went
to
mass
and
all
the
services
quite
regularly
and
where
did
he
post
himself
found
this
out
two
yards
of
madame
de
merret
s
chapel
as
he
took
that
place
the
very
first
time
he
entered
the
church
no
one
imagined
that
there
was
any
purpose
in
it
besides
he
never
raised
his
nose
above
his
book
poor
young
man
and
then
monsieur
of
an
evening
he
went
for
a
walk
on
the
hill
among
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
it
was
his
only
amusement
poor
man
it
reminded
him
of
his
native
land
they
say
that
spain
is
all
hills
one
evening
a
few
days
after
he
was
sent
here
he
was
out
very
late
i
was
rather
uneasy
when
he
did
not
come
in
till
just
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
but
we
all
got
used
to
his
whims
he
took
the
key
of
the
door
and
we
never
sat
up
for
him
he
lived
in
a
house
belonging
to
us
in
the
rue
des
casernes
well
then
one
of
our
told
us
one
evening
that
going
down
to
wash
the
horses
in
the
river
he
fancied
he
had
seen
the
spanish
grandee
swimming
some
little
way
off
just
like
a
fish
when
he
came
in
i
told
him
to
be
careful
of
the
weeds
and
he
seemed
put
out
at
having
been
seen
in
the
water
at
last
monsieur
one
day
or
rather
one
morning
we
did
not
find
him
in
his
room
he
had
not
come
back
by
hunting
through
his
things
i
found
a
written
paper
in
the
drawer
of
his
table
with
fifty
pieces
of
spanish
gold
of
the
kind
they
call
doubloons
worth
about
five
thousand
francs
and
in
a
little
sealed
box
ten
thousand
francs
worth
of
diamonds
the
paper
said
that
in
case
he
should
not
return
he
left
us
this
money
and
these
diamonds
in
trust
to
found
masses
to
thank
god
for
his
escape
and
for
his
salvation
at
that
time
i
still
had
my
husband
who
ran
off
in
search
of
him
and
this
is
the
queer
part
of
the
story
he
brought
back
the
spaniard
s
clothes
which
he
had
found
under
a
big
stone
on
a
sort
of
breakwater
along
the
river
bank
nearly
opposite
la
grande
bretèche
my
husband
went
so
early
that
no
one
saw
him
after
reading
the
letter
he
burnt
the
clothes
and
in
obedience
to
count
férédia
s
wish
we
announced
that
he
had
escaped
the
set
all
the
constabulary
at
his
heels
but
pshaw
he
was
never
caught
lepas
believed
that
the
spaniard
had
drowned
himself
i
sir
have
never
thought
so
i
believe
on
the
contrary
that
he
had
something
to
do
with
the
business
about
madame
de
merret
seeing
that
rosalie
told
me
that
the
crucifix
her
mistress
was
so
fond
of
that
she
had
it
buried
with
her
was
made
of
ebony
and
silver
now
in
the
early
days
of
his
stay
here
monsieur
férédia
had
one
of
ebony
and
silver
which
i
never
saw
now
monsieur
do
not
you
say
that
i
need
have
no
remorse
about
the
spaniard
s
fifteen
thousand
francs
are
they
not
really
and
truly
mine
have
you
never
tried
to
question
rosalie
said
i
oh
to
be
sure
i
have
sir
but
what
is
to
be
done
that
girl
is
like
a
wall
she
knows
something
but
it
is
impossible
to
make
her
after
chatting
with
me
for
a
few
minutes
my
hostess
left
me
a
prey
to
vague
and
sinister
thoughts
to
romantic
curiosity
and
a
religious
dread
not
unlike
the
deep
emotion
which
comes
upon
us
when
we
go
into
a
dark
church
at
night
and
discern
a
feeble
light
glimmering
under
a
lofty
dim
figure
glides
sweep
of
a
gown
or
of
a
priest
s
cassock
is
we
shiver
la
grande
bretèche
with
its
rank
grasses
its
shuttered
windows
its
rusty
its
locked
doors
its
deserted
rooms
suddenly
rose
before
me
in
fantastic
vividness
i
tried
to
get
into
the
mysterious
dwelling
to
search
out
the
heart
of
this
solemn
story
this
drama
which
had
killed
three
persons
rosalie
became
in
my
eyes
the
most
interesting
being
in
vendôme
as
i
studied
her
i
detected
signs
of
an
inmost
thought
in
spite
of
the
blooming
health
that
glowed
in
her
dimpled
face
there
was
in
her
soul
some
element
of
ruth
or
of
hope
her
manner
suggested
a
secret
like
the
expression
of
devout
souls
who
pray
in
excess
or
of
a
girl
who
has
killed
her
child
and
for
ever
hears
its
last
cry
nevertheless
she
was
simple
and
clumsy
in
her
ways
her
vacant
smile
had
nothing
criminal
in
it
and
you
would
have
pronounced
her
innocent
only
from
seeing
the
large
red
and
blue
checked
kerchief
that
covered
her
stalwart
bust
tucked
into
the
bodice
of
a
and
gown
no
said
i
to
myself
i
will
not
quit
vendôme
without
knowing
the
whole
history
of
la
grande
bretèche
to
achieve
this
end
i
will
make
love
to
rosalie
if
it
proves
rosalie
said
i
one
evening
your
servant
sir
you
are
not
married
she
started
a
little
oh
there
is
no
lack
of
men
if
ever
i
take
a
fancy
to
be
miserable
she
replied
laughing
she
got
over
her
agitation
at
once
for
every
woman
from
the
highest
lady
to
the
inclusive
has
a
native
presence
of
mind
yes
you
are
fresh
and
enough
never
to
lack
lovers
but
tell
me
rosalie
why
did
you
become
an
on
leaving
madame
de
merret
did
she
not
leave
you
some
little
annuity
oh
yes
sir
but
my
place
here
is
the
best
in
all
the
town
of
this
reply
was
such
an
one
as
judges
and
attorneys
call
evasive
rosalie
as
it
seemed
to
me
held
in
this
romantic
affair
the
place
of
the
middle
square
of
the
she
was
at
the
very
centre
of
the
interest
and
of
the
truth
she
appeared
to
me
to
be
tied
into
the
knot
of
it
it
was
not
a
case
for
ordinary
this
girl
contained
the
last
chapter
of
a
romance
and
from
that
moment
all
my
attentions
were
devoted
to
rosalie
by
dint
of
studying
the
girl
i
observed
in
her
as
in
every
woman
whom
we
make
our
ruling
thought
a
variety
of
good
qualities
she
was
clean
and
neat
she
was
handsome
i
need
not
say
she
soon
was
possessed
of
every
charm
that
desire
can
lend
to
a
woman
in
whatever
rank
of
life
a
fortnight
after
the
notary
s
visit
one
evening
or
rather
one
morning
in
the
small
hours
i
said
to
rosalie
come
tell
me
all
you
know
about
madame
de
oh
she
said
i
will
tell
you
but
keep
the
secret
all
right
my
child
i
will
keep
all
your
secrets
with
a
thief
s
honor
which
is
the
most
loyal
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you
said
she
i
would
rather
it
should
be
with
your
thereupon
she
set
her
straight
and
settled
herself
to
tell
the
tale
for
there
is
no
doubt
a
particular
attitude
of
confidence
and
security
is
necessary
to
the
telling
of
a
narrative
the
best
tales
are
told
at
a
certain
as
we
are
all
here
at
table
no
one
ever
told
a
story
well
standing
up
or
fasting
if
i
were
to
reproduce
exactly
rosalie
s
diffuse
eloquence
a
whole
volume
would
scarcely
contain
it
now
as
the
event
of
which
she
gave
me
a
confused
account
stands
exactly
midway
between
the
notary
s
gossip
and
that
of
madame
lepas
as
precisely
as
the
middle
term
of
a
sum
stands
between
the
first
and
third
i
have
only
to
relate
it
in
as
few
words
as
may
be
i
shall
therefore
be
brief
the
room
at
la
grande
bretèche
in
which
madame
de
merret
slept
was
on
the
ground
floor
a
little
cupboard
in
the
wall
about
four
feet
deep
served
her
to
hang
her
dresses
in
three
months
before
the
evening
of
which
i
have
to
relate
the
events
madame
de
merret
had
been
seriously
ailing
so
much
so
that
her
husband
had
left
her
to
herself
and
had
his
own
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
by
one
of
those
accidents
which
it
is
impossible
to
foresee
he
came
in
that
evening
two
hours
later
than
usual
from
the
club
where
he
went
to
read
the
papers
and
talk
politics
with
the
residents
in
the
neighborhood
his
wife
supposed
him
to
have
come
in
to
be
in
bed
and
asleep
but
the
invasion
of
france
had
been
the
subject
of
a
very
animated
discussion
the
game
of
billiards
had
waxed
vehement
he
had
lost
forty
francs
an
enormous
sum
at
vendôme
where
everybody
is
thrifty
and
where
social
habits
are
restrained
within
the
bounds
of
a
simplicity
worthy
of
all
praise
and
the
foundation
perhaps
of
a
form
of
true
happiness
which
no
parisian
would
care
for
for
some
time
past
monsieur
de
merret
had
been
satisfied
to
ask
rosalie
whether
his
wife
was
in
bed
on
the
girl
s
replying
always
in
the
affirmative
he
at
once
went
to
his
own
room
with
the
good
faith
that
comes
of
habit
and
confidence
but
this
evening
on
coming
in
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
see
madame
de
merret
to
tell
her
of
his
and
perhaps
to
find
consolation
during
dinner
he
had
observed
that
his
wife
was
very
becomingly
dressed
he
reflected
as
he
came
home
from
the
club
that
his
wife
was
certainly
much
better
that
convalescence
had
improved
her
beauty
discovering
it
as
husbands
discover
everything
a
little
too
late
instead
of
calling
rosalie
who
was
in
the
kitchen
at
the
moment
watching
the
cook
and
the
coachman
playing
a
puzzling
hand
at
cards
monsieur
de
merret
made
his
way
to
his
wife
s
room
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
which
he
set
down
at
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairs
his
step
easy
to
recognize
rang
under
the
vaulted
passage
at
the
instant
when
the
gentleman
turned
the
key
to
enter
his
wife
s
room
he
fancied
he
heard
the
door
shut
of
the
closet
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
when
he
went
in
madame
de
merret
was
alone
standing
in
front
of
the
fireplace
the
unsuspecting
husband
fancied
that
rosalie
was
in
the
cupboard
nevertheless
a
doubt
ringing
in
his
ears
like
a
peal
of
bells
put
him
on
his
guard
he
looked
at
his
wife
and
read
in
her
eyes
an
indescribably
anxious
and
haunted
expression
you
are
very
late
said
voice
usually
so
clear
and
sweet
struck
him
as
being
slightly
husky
monsieur
de
merret
made
no
reply
for
at
this
moment
rosalie
came
in
this
was
like
a
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
going
from
one
window
to
another
at
a
regular
pace
his
arms
folded
have
you
had
bad
news
or
are
you
ill
his
wife
asked
him
timidly
while
rosalie
helped
her
to
undress
he
made
no
reply
you
can
go
rosalie
said
madame
de
merret
to
her
maid
i
can
put
in
my
scented
disaster
at
the
mere
aspect
of
her
husband
s
face
and
wished
to
be
alone
with
him
as
soon
as
rosalie
was
gone
or
supposed
to
be
gone
for
she
lingered
a
few
minutes
in
the
passage
monsieur
de
merret
came
and
stood
facing
his
wife
and
said
coldly
madame
there
is
some
one
in
your
cupboard
she
looked
at
her
husband
calmly
and
replied
quite
simply
no
this
no
wrung
monsieur
de
merret
s
heart
he
did
not
believe
it
and
yet
his
wife
had
never
appeared
purer
or
more
saintly
than
she
seemed
to
be
at
this
moment
he
rose
to
go
and
open
the
closet
door
madame
de
merret
took
his
hand
stopped
him
looked
at
him
sadly
and
said
in
a
voice
of
strange
emotion
remember
if
you
should
find
no
one
there
everything
must
be
at
an
end
between
you
and
the
extraordinary
dignity
of
his
wife
s
attitude
filled
him
with
deep
esteem
for
her
and
inspired
him
with
one
of
those
resolves
which
need
only
a
grander
stage
to
become
immortal
no
josephine
he
said
i
will
not
open
it
in
either
event
we
should
be
parted
for
ever
listen
i
know
all
the
purity
of
your
soul
i
know
you
lead
a
saintly
life
and
would
not
commit
a
deadly
sin
to
save
your
these
words
madame
de
merret
looked
at
her
husband
with
a
haggard
see
here
is
your
crucifix
he
went
on
swear
to
me
before
god
that
there
is
no
one
in
there
i
will
believe
will
never
open
that
madame
de
merret
took
up
the
crucifix
and
said
i
swear
louder
said
her
husband
and
repeat
i
swear
before
god
that
there
is
nobody
in
that
she
repeated
the
words
without
flinching
that
will
do
said
monsieur
de
merret
coldly
after
a
moment
s
silence
you
have
there
a
fine
piece
of
work
which
i
never
saw
before
said
he
examining
the
crucifix
of
ebony
and
silver
very
artistically
wrought
i
found
it
at
duvivier
s
last
year
when
that
troop
of
spanish
prisoners
came
through
vendôme
he
bought
it
of
a
spanish
indeed
said
monsieur
de
merret
hanging
the
crucifix
on
its
nail
and
he
rang
the
bell
he
had
to
wait
for
rosalie
monsieur
de
merret
went
forward
quickly
to
meet
her
led
her
into
the
bay
of
the
window
that
looked
on
to
the
garden
and
said
to
her
in
an
undertone
i
know
that
gorenflot
wants
to
marry
you
that
poverty
alone
prevents
your
setting
up
house
and
that
you
told
him
you
would
not
be
his
wife
till
he
found
means
to
become
a
master
go
and
fetch
him
tell
him
to
come
here
with
his
trowel
and
tools
contrive
to
wake
no
one
in
his
house
but
himself
his
reward
will
be
beyond
your
wishes
above
all
go
out
without
saying
a
else
and
he
frowned
rosalie
was
going
and
he
called
her
back
here
take
my
said
he
jean
monsieur
de
merret
called
in
a
voice
of
thunder
down
the
passage
jean
who
was
both
coachman
and
confidential
servant
left
his
cards
and
came
go
to
bed
all
of
you
said
his
master
beckoning
him
to
come
close
and
the
gentleman
added
in
a
whisper
when
they
are
all
understand
down
and
tell
monsieur
de
merret
who
had
never
lost
sight
of
his
wife
while
giving
his
orders
quietly
came
back
to
her
at
the
fireside
and
began
to
tell
her
the
details
of
the
game
of
billiards
and
the
discussion
at
the
club
when
rosalie
returned
she
found
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
conversing
amiably
not
long
before
this
monsieur
de
merret
had
had
new
ceilings
made
to
all
the
on
the
ground
floor
plaster
is
very
scarce
at
vendôme
the
price
is
enhanced
by
the
cost
of
carriage
the
gentleman
had
therefore
had
a
considerable
quantity
delivered
to
him
knowing
that
he
could
always
find
purchasers
for
what
might
be
left
it
was
this
circumstance
which
suggested
the
plan
he
carried
out
gorenflot
is
here
sir
said
rosalie
in
a
whisper
tell
him
to
come
in
said
her
master
aloud
madame
de
merret
turned
paler
when
she
saw
the
mason
gorenflot
said
her
husband
go
and
fetch
some
bricks
from
the
bring
enough
to
wall
up
the
door
of
this
cupboard
you
can
use
the
plaster
that
is
left
for
then
dragging
rosalie
and
the
workman
close
to
listen
gorenflot
said
he
in
a
low
voice
you
are
to
sleep
here
but
morning
you
shall
have
a
passport
to
take
you
abroad
to
a
place
i
will
tell
you
of
i
will
give
you
six
thousand
francs
for
your
journey
you
must
live
in
that
town
for
ten
years
if
you
find
you
do
not
like
it
you
may
settle
in
another
but
it
must
be
in
the
same
country
go
through
paris
and
wait
there
till
i
join
you
i
will
there
give
you
an
agreement
for
six
thousand
francs
more
to
be
paid
to
you
on
your
return
provided
you
have
carried
out
the
conditions
of
the
bargain
for
that
price
you
are
to
keep
perfect
silence
as
to
what
you
have
to
do
this
night
to
you
rosalie
i
will
secure
ten
thousand
francs
which
will
not
be
paid
to
you
till
your
wedding
day
and
on
condition
of
your
marrying
gorenflot
but
to
get
married
you
must
hold
your
tongue
if
not
no
wedding
gift
rosalie
said
madame
de
merret
come
and
brush
my
her
husband
quietly
walked
up
and
down
the
room
keeping
an
eye
on
the
door
on
the
mason
and
on
his
wife
but
without
any
insulting
display
of
suspicion
gorenflot
could
not
help
making
some
noise
madame
de
merret
seized
a
moment
when
he
was
unloading
some
bricks
and
when
her
husband
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
to
say
to
rosalie
my
dear
child
i
will
give
you
a
thousand
francs
a
year
if
only
you
will
tell
gorenflot
to
leave
a
crack
at
the
then
she
added
aloud
quite
coolly
you
had
better
help
monsieur
and
madame
de
merret
were
silent
all
the
time
while
gorenflot
was
walling
up
the
door
this
silence
was
intentional
on
the
husband
s
part
he
did
not
wish
to
give
his
wife
the
opportunity
of
saying
anything
with
a
double
meaning
on
madame
de
merret
s
side
it
was
pride
or
prudence
when
the
wall
was
half
built
up
the
cunning
mason
took
advantage
of
his
master
s
back
being
turned
to
break
one
of
the
two
panes
in
the
top
of
the
door
with
a
blow
of
his
pick
by
this
madame
de
merret
understood
that
rosalie
had
spoken
to
gorenflot
they
all
three
then
saw
the
face
of
a
dark
man
with
black
hair
and
flaming
eyes
before
her
husband
turned
round
again
the
poor
woman
had
nodded
to
the
stranger
to
whom
the
signal
was
meant
to
convey
at
four
o
clock
as
the
day
was
dawning
for
it
was
the
month
of
september
the
work
was
done
the
mason
was
placed
in
charge
of
jean
and
monsieur
de
merret
slept
in
his
wife
s
room
next
morning
when
he
got
up
he
said
with
apparent
carelessness
oh
by
the
way
i
must
go
to
the
maire
for
the
he
put
on
his
hat
took
two
or
three
steps
towards
the
door
paused
and
took
the
crucifix
his
wife
was
trembling
with
joy
he
will
go
to
duvivier
s
thought
she
as
soon
as
he
had
left
madame
de
merret
rang
for
rosalie
and
then
in
a
terrible
voice
she
cried
the
pick
bring
the
pick
and
set
to
work
i
saw
how
gorenflot
did
it
yesterday
we
shall
have
time
to
make
a
gap
and
build
it
up
in
an
instant
rosalie
had
brought
her
mistress
a
sort
of
cleaver
she
with
a
vehemence
of
which
no
words
can
give
an
idea
set
to
work
to
demolish
the
wall
she
had
already
got
out
a
few
bricks
when
turning
to
deal
a
stronger
blow
than
before
she
saw
behind
her
monsieur
de
merret
she
fainted
away
lay
madame
on
her
bed
said
he
coldly
foreseeing
what
would
certainly
happen
in
his
absence
he
had
laid
this
trap
for
his
wife
he
had
merely
written
to
the
maire
and
sent
for
duvivier
the
jeweler
arrived
just
as
the
disorder
in
the
room
had
been
repaired
duvivier
asked
monsieur
de
merret
did
not
you
buy
some
crucifixes
of
the
spaniards
who
passed
through
the
town
no
very
good
thank
you
said
he
flashing
a
tiger
s
glare
at
his
wife
jean
he
added
turning
to
his
confidential
valet
you
can
serve
my
meals
here
in
madame
de
merret
s
room
she
is
ill
and
i
shall
not
leave
her
till
she
the
cruel
man
remained
in
his
wife
s
room
for
twenty
days
during
the
earlier
time
when
there
was
some
little
noise
in
the
closet
and
josephine
wanted
to
intercede
for
the
dying
man
he
said
without
allowing
her
to
utter
a
word
you
swore
on
the
cross
that
there
was
no
one
after
this
story
all
the
ladies
rose
from
table
and
thus
the
spell
under
which
bianchon
had
held
them
was
broken
but
there
were
some
among
them
who
had
almost
shivered
