story
of
noorna
bin

the
genie
karaz
and
the
princess
of

the
wiles
of
rabesqurat
the
palace
of

the
sons
of
aklis
the
sword
of
aklis
the
lily
of
the
enchanted
sea
now
after
the
had
skimmed
calmly
awhile
it
began
to
pitch
and
grew
unquiet
and
came
upon
a
surging
foam
pale
and
with
scintillating
bubbles
the
surges
increased
in
volume
and
boiled
hissing
as
with
anger
like
savage
animals
presently
the
rose
upon
one
very
lofty
swell
and
shibli
bagarag
lost
hold
of
it
and
lo
it
was
overturned
and
engulfed
in
the
descent
of
the
great
mountain
of
water
and
the
princess
goorelka
was
immersed
in
the
depths
she
would
have
sunk
but
shibli
bagarag
caught
hold
of
her
and
supported
her
to
the
shore
by
the
strength
of
his
right
arm
the
shore
was
one
of
sand
and
shells
their
wet
cheeks
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
over
it
hung
a
promontory
a
huge
jut
of
black
rock
now
the
princess
when
she
landed
seeing
not
him
that
supported
her
delayed
not
to
run
beneath
the
rock
and
ascended
by
steps
cut
from
the
base
of
the
rock
and
shibli
bagarag
followed
her
by
winding
paths
round
the
rock
till
she
came
to
the
highest
peak
commanding
the
circle
of
the
enchanted
sea
and
glimpses
of
enthralled
vessels
and
mariners
bewitched
on
board
long
paths
of
starlight
rippled
into
the
distant
gloom
and
the
reflection
of
the
moon
opposite
was
as
a
wide
nuptial
sheet
of
silver
on
the
waters
islands
green
and
white
and
with
soft
music
floating
from
their
foliage
sailed
slowly
to
and
fro
surely
to
dwell
reclining
among
the
slopes
of
those
islands
a
man
would
forfeit
paradise
now
the
princess
as
she
stood
upon
the
peak
knew
that
she
was
not
alone
and
pretended
to
slip
from
her
footing
and
shibli
bagarag
called
out
and
ran
to
her
but
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
his
voice
and
laughed
and
he
knew
he
was
outwitted
then
to
deceive
her
he
dropped
from
the
phial
twenty
drops
round
her
on
the
rock
and
those
twenty
drops
became
twenty
voices
so
that
she
was
bewildered
with
their
calls
and
stopped
her
ears
and
ran
from
them
and
descended
from
the
eminence
nimbly
slipping
over
ledges
and
leaping
the
abysses
and
shibli
bagarag
followed
her
clutching
at
the
trailers
and
tearing
them
with
him
letting
loose
a
torrent
of
stones
and
earth
till
on
a
sudden
they
stood
together
above
a
greenswarded
basin
of
the
rock
opening
to
the
sea
and
in
the
middle
of
the
basin
lo
in
stature
like
a
maiden
of
the
mountains
and
one
that
droopeth
her
head
pensively
thinking
of
her
absent
lover
the
enchanted
lily
wonder
knocked
at
the
breast
of
shibli
bagarag
when
he
saw
that
queenly
flower
waving
its
illumined
head
to
the
breeze
he
could
not
retain
a
cry
of
rapture
as
he
did
this
the
princess
stretched
her
hand
to
where
he
was
and
groped
a
moment
and
caught
him
by
the
silken
dress
and
tore
in
it
a
great
rent
and
by
the
rent
he
stood
revealed
to
her
then
said
she
youth
thou
halt
done
ill
to
follow
me
here
and
the
danger
of
it
is
past
computing
surely
the
motive
was
a
deep
one
nought
other
than
the
love
of
me
she
spoke
winningly
sweet
words
to
a
luted
voice
and
the
youth
fell
upon
his
knees
before
her
smitten
by
her
beauty
and
he
said
followed
thee
here
as
i
would
follow
such
loveliness
to
the
gates
of
doom
o
princess
of
oolb
she
smiled
and
said
playfully
will
read
by
thy
hand
whether
thou
be
one
faithful
in
love
she
took
his
hand
and
sprinkled
on
it
earth
and
gravel
and
commenced
scanning
it
curiously
as
she
scanned
it
her
forehead
wrinkled
up
and
a
shot
like
black
lightning
travelled
across
her
countenance
withering
its
beauty
she
cried
in
a
forced
voice
it
is
well
o
youth
for
thee
and
for
me
that
thou
lovest
me
and
art
faithful
in
love
the
look
of
the
princess
of
oolb
and
her
voice
affrighted
the
soul
of
shibli
bagarag
and
he
would
have
turned
from
her
but
she
held
him
and
went
to
the
lily
and
emptied
into
the
palm
of
her
hand
the
dew
that
was
in
the
lily
and
raised
it
to
the
lips
of
shibli
bagarag
bidding
him
drink
as
a
pledge
for
her
sake
and
her
love
and
to
appease
his
thirst
as
he
was
about
to
drink
there
fell
into
the
palm
of
the
princess
from
above
what
seemed
a
bolt
of
storm
scattering
the
dew
and
after
he
had
blinked
with
the
suddenness
of
the
action
he
looked
and
beheld
the
hawk
its
red
eyes
inflamed
with
wrath
and
the
hawk
screamed
into
the
ear
of
shibli
bagarag
up
the
lily
ere
it
is
too
late
o
fool
the
dew
was
poison
pluck
it
by
the
root
with
thy
right
hand
so
thereat
he
strode
to
the
lily
and
grasped
it
and
pulled
with
his
strength
and
the
lily
was
loosened
and
yielded
and
came
forth
streaming
with
blood
from
the
bulb
of
the
root
surely
the
bulb
of
the
root
was
a
palpitating
heart
yet
warm
even
as
that
we
have
within
our
bosoms
now
from
the
terror
of
that
sight
the
princess
hid
her
eyes
and
shrank
away
and
the
lines
of
malice
avarice
and
envy
seemed
ageing
her
at
every
breath
then
the
hawk
pecked
at
her
three
pecks
and
perched
on
a
corner
of
rock
and
called
shrilly
the
name
and
the
genie
karaz
came
slanting
down
the
night
air
like
a
preying
bird
and
stood
among
them
so
the
hawk
cried
o
karaz
the
freshness
of
thy
princess
of
oolb
and
the
genie
regarded
her
till
loathing
curled
his
lip
for
she
grew
in
ghastliness
to
the
colour
of
a
frog
and
a
frog
face
was
hers
a
camel
back
a
pelican
throat
the
legs
of
a
peacock
then
the
hawk
cried
this
how
ye
meet
ye
lovers
ye
that
will
be
wedded
and
the
hawk
made
his
tongue
as
a
thorn
to
them
at
the
last
it
exclaimed
let
us
fight
our
battle
karaz
but
the
genie
said
there
will
come
a
time
for
that
traitress
the
hawk
cried
delayest
till
the
phial
of
paravid
the
hairs
of
garraveen
and
this
lily
my
three
helps
are
expended
thinking
aklis
for
which
we
barter
them
striketh
but
a
single
blow
that
is
well
go
then
and
take
thy
princess
and
obtain
permission
of
the
king
of
oolb
her
father
to
wed
her
o
karaz
the
hawk
whistled
with
laughter
and
the
genie
was
stung
with
its
mockeries
and
clutched
the
princess
of
oolb
in
a
bunch
and
arose
from
the
ground
with
her
slanting
up
the
like
fire
till
he
was
seen
high
up
even
as
an
angry
star
reddening
the
seas
beneath
when
he
was
lost
to
the
eye
shibli
bagarag
drew
a
long
breath
and
cried
aloud
likeness
of
that
princess
of
oolb
in
her
ugliness
to
noorna
my
betrothed
is
a
thing
marvellous
if
it
be
not
she
herself
and
he
reflected
she
seemed
not
to
recognize
and
claim
me
and
thought
am
bound
to
her
by
gratitude
and
i
should
have
rescued
her
from
karaz
but
i
know
not
if
it
be
she
wullahy
i
am
bewildered
i
will
ask
counsel
of
the
hawk
he
looked
to
the
corner
of
the
rock
where
the
hawk
had
perched
but
the
hawk
was
gone
as
he
searched
for
it
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
bed
of
earth
where
the
lily
stood
ere
he
plucked
it
and
lo
in
the
place
of
the
lily
there
was
a
damsel
dressed
in
white
shining
silks
fairer
than
the
enchanted
flower
straighter
than
the
stalk
of
it
her
head
slightly
drooping
like
the
moon
on
a
border
of
the
night
her
bosom
like
the
swell
of
the
sea
in
moonlight
her
eyes
dark
under
a
low
arch
of
darker
lashes
like
stars
on
the
skirts
of
storm
and
she
was
the
very
dream
of
loveliness
formed
to
freeze
with
awe
and
to
inflame
with
passion
so
shibli
bagarag
gazed
at
her
with
adoration
his
hands
stretched
to
her
as
if
to
clasp
her
fearing
she
was
a
vision
and
would
fade
and
the
damsel
smiled
a
sweet
smile
and
lifted
her
antelope
eyes
and
said
am
i
and
to
whom
might
i
be
likened
o
youth
and
he
answered
thou
art
o
young
perfection
i
know
not
if
not
a
houri
of
paradise
but
thou
art
like
the
princess
of
oolb
yet
lovelier
oh
lovelier
and
thy
voice
is
the
voice
of
noorna
my
betrothed
yet
purer
sweeter
younger
so
the
damsel
laughed
a
laugh
like
a
sudden
sweeping
of
wild
chords
of
music
and
said
youth
thou
not
the
ascent
of
noorna
thy
betrothed
gathered
in
a
bunch
by
karaz
and
he
answered
saw
her
but
i
knew
not
o
damsel
of
beauty
surely
i
was
bewildered
amazed
without
power
to
contend
with
the
genie
then
she
said
thou
release
her
so
kiss
me
on
the
lips
on
the
eyes
and
on
the
forehead
three
kisses
each
time
and
with
the
first
say
by
the
well
of
paravid
and
with
the
second
by
the
strength
of
garraveen
and
with
the
third
by
the
lily
of
the
sea
now
the
heart
of
the
youth
bounded
at
her
words
and
he
went
to
her
and
trembling
kissed
her
all
bashfully
on
the
lips
on
the
eyes
and
on
the
forehead
saying
each
time
as
she
directed
then
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
stepped
from
the
bed
of
earth
crying
joyfully
be
to
allah
and
the
prophet
noorna
is
released
from
the
sorceries
that
held
her
and
powerful
so
while
he
was
wondering
she
said
thou
not
the
woman
thy
betrothed
he
answered
damsel
of
beauty
i
am
charged
with
many
feelings
doubts
and
hopes
are
mixed
in
me
say
first
who
thou
art
and
fill
my
two
ears
with
bliss
and
she
said
will
leave
my
name
to
other
lips
surely
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
vizier
feshnavat
betrothed
to
a
wandering
youth
a
barber
who
sickened
at
the
betrothal
and
consoled
himself
with
a
proverb
when
he
gave
me
the
kiss
of
contract
and
knew
not
how
with
truth
to
pay
me
a
compliment
now
shibli
bagarag
saw
this
was
indeed
noorna
bin
noorka
his
betrothed
and
he
fell
before
her
in
love
and
astonishment
but
she
lifted
him
to
her
neck
and
embraced
him
saying
i
not
truly
when
i
said
i
am
that
i
shall
be
my
youth
is
not
as
that
of
bhanavar
the
beautiful
gained
at
another
cost
but
my
own
and
stolen
from
me
by
wicked
sorceries
and
he
cried
me
o
noorna
my
betrothed
how
this
matter
came
to
pass
she
said
our
way
to
aklis
she
bade
him
grasp
the
lily
and
follow
her
and
he
followed
her
down
the
rock
and
over
the
bright
shells
upon
the
sand
admiring
her
stateliness
her
willowy
lightness
her
slimness
as
of
the
then
she
waded
in
the
water
and
began
to
strike
out
with
her
arms
and
swim
boldly
he
likewise
and
presently
they
came
to
a
current
that
hurried
them
off
in
its
course
and
carried
them
as
weeds
streaming
rapidly
he
was
bearing
witness
to
his
faith
as
a
man
that
has
lost
hope
of
life
when
a
strong
eddy
stayed
him
and
whirled
him
from
the
current
into
the
calm
water
so
he
looked
for
noorna
and
saw
her
safe
beside
him
flinging
back
the
wet
tresses
from
her
face
that
was
like
the
full
moon
growing
radiant
behind
a
dispersing
cloud
and
she
said
not
for
the
interpretation
of
wonders
in
this
sea
for
they
cluster
like
dates
on
a
date
branch
surely
to
be
with
me
is
enough
and
she
bewitched
him
in
the
midst
of
the
waters
making
him
oblivious
of
all
save
her
so
that
he
hugged
the
golden
net
of
her
smiles
and
fair
flatteries
and
swam
with
an
exulting
stroke
giving
his
breast
broadly
to
the
low
billows
and
shouting
verses
of
love
and
delight
to
her
and
while
they
swam
sweetly
behold
there
was
seen
a
pearly
shell
of
flashing
crimson
amethyst
and
emerald
that
came
scudding
over
the
waves
toward
them
raised
to
the
wind
and
in
its
front
two
silver
seats
when
she
saw
it
noorna
cried
has
sent
me
this
rabesqurat
perchance
is
she
favourable
to
my
wishes
and
this
were
well
then
she
swayed
in
the
water
sideways
and
drew
the
shell
to
her
and
the
twain
climbed
into
it
and
sat
each
on
one
of
the
silver
seats
folded
together
in
its
lightness
it
was
as
a
before
the
wind
on
the
blue
water
and
bore
them
onward
airily
at
his
feet
shibli
bagarag
beheld
a
stool
of
carved
topaz
and
above
his
head
the
arch
of
the
shell
was
inlaid
with
wreaths
of
gems
never
was
vessel
fairer
than
that
now
while
they
were
speeding
over
the
water
noorna
said
end
of
this
fair
sea
is
aklis
and
beyond
it
is
the
koosh
so
while
the
wind
is
our
helmsman
and
we
go
circled
by
the
quiet
of
this
sea
i
tell
thee
of
myself
if
thou
carest
to
hear
and
he
cried
with
the
ardour
of
love
i
would
hear
of
nought
save
thyself
noorna
and
the
music
of
the
happy
garden
compareth
not
in
sweetness
with
it
i
long
for
the
freshness
of
thy
voice
as
the
desert
camel
for
the
green
spring
o
my
betrothed
so
she
said
now
give
ear
to
the
following
and
this
is
the
story
of
noorna
bin
noorka
the
genie
karaz
and
the
princess
of
oolb
know
that
when
i
was
a
babe
i
lay
on
my
mother
bosom
in
the
wilderness
and
it
was
the
bosom
of
death
surely
i
slept
and
smiled
and
dreamed
the
infant
dream
and
knew
not
the
coldness
of
the
thing
i
touched
so
were
we
even
as
two
dead
creatures
lying
there
but
life
was
in
me
and
i
awoke
with
hunger
at
the
time
of
feeding
and
turned
to
my
mother
and
put
up
my
little
mouth
to
her
for
nourishment
and
sucked
her
but
nothing
came
i
cried
and
commenced
chiding
her
and
after
a
while
it
was
as
decreed
that
certain
horsemen
of
a
troop
passing
through
the
wilderness
beheld
me
and
seeing
my
distress
and
the
helpless
being
i
was
their
hearts
were
stirred
and
they
were
mindful
of
what
the
poet
says
concerning
succour
given
to
the
poor
helpless
and
innocent
of
this
world
and
took
me
up
and
mixed
for
me
camel
milk
and
water
from
the
bags
and
comforted
me
and
bore
me
with
them
after
they
had
paid
funeral
rites
to
the
body
of
my
mother
now
the
showeth
if
the
be
of
the
wilds
or
of
the
garden
and
the
chief
of
that
troop
seeing
me
born
to
the
uses
of
gentleness
carried
me
in
his
arms
with
him
to
his
wife
and
persuaded
her
that
was
childless
to
make
me
the
child
of
their
adoption
so
i
abode
with
them
during
the
period
of
infancy
and
childhood
caressed
and
cared
for
as
is
said
the
flower
a
stranger
hand
may
gather
strikes
root
into
the
stranger
breast
affection
is
our
mother
father
friend
and
of
cherishers
the
best
and
i
loved
them
as
their
own
child
witting
not
but
that
i
was
their
child
till
on
a
day
while
i
played
among
some
children
of
my
years
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
oolb
passed
by
us
on
a
mule
with
her
slaves
and
drawn
swords
and
called
to
me
little
castaway
and
had
me
brought
to
her
and
peered
upon
my
face
in
a
manner
that
frightened
me
for
i
was
young
then
she
put
me
down
from
the
neck
of
her
mule
where
she
had
seated
me
saying
of
a
dead
mother
and
a
runaway
father
what
need
i
fear
from
thy
like
and
the
dreams
of
a
genie
so
she
departed
but
i
forgot
not
her
words
and
dwelt
upon
them
and
grew
fevered
with
them
and
drooped
now
when
he
saw
my
bloom
of
health
gone
heaviness
on
my
feet
the
light
hollowed
from
my
eyes
my
benefactor
ravaloke
he
that
i
had
thought
my
father
took
me
between
his
knees
and
asked
me
what
it
was
and
the
cause
of
my
ailing
and
i
told
him
then
said
he
is
so
thou
art
not
my
child
but
i
love
thee
as
mine
o
my
little
and
why
the
princess
should
fancy
fear
of
thee
i
like
not
to
think
but
fear
thou
her
for
she
is
a
mask
of
wiles
and
a
vine
trailing
over
pitfalls
such
a
sorceress
the
world
knoweth
not
as
goorelka
of
oolb
now
i
was
penetrated
by
what
he
said
and
ceased
to
be
a
companion
to
them
that
loved
childish
games
and
romps
and
meditated
by
myself
in
gardens
and
closets
feigning
sleep
when
the
elder
ones
discoursed
that
i
might
learn
something
of
this
mystery
and
all
that
was
spoken
perplexed
me
more
as
the
sage
declareth
who
in
a
labyrinth
wandereth
without
clue
more
that
he
wandereth
doth
himself
undo
though
i
was
quick
as
the
falcon
i
discovered
nought
flying
ever
at
false
game
a
follower
of
misleading
beams
a
cheated
soul
the
mock
of
dreams
at
times
i
thought
that
it
was
the
king
of
oolb
was
my
father
and
plotted
to
come
in
his
path
and
there
were
kings
and
princes
of
far
countries
whom
i
sought
to
encounter
that
they
might
claim
me
but
none
claimed
me
o
my
betrothed
few
gave
me
love
beside
ravaloke
and
when
the
wife
that
he
cherished
died
he
solely
for
i
was
lost
in
waywardness
and
the
slave
of
moody
imaginings
is
said
if
thou
the
love
of
the
world
for
thyself
wouldst
gain
mould
thy
breast
liker
the
world
to
become
for
its
like
the
world
loveth
best
and
this
was
not
i
then
now
the
sons
and
daughters
of
men
are
used
to
celebrate
the
days
of
their
birth
with
gifts
and
rejoicings
but
i
could
only
celebrate
that
day
which
delivered
me
from
death
into
the
hands
of
ravaloke
as
none
knew
my
when
it
was
the
twelfth
return
of
this
event
ravaloke
my
heart
father
called
me
to
him
and
pressed
in
my
hand
a
glittering
coin
telling
me
to
buy
with
it
in
the
bazaars
what
i
would
so
i
went
forth
attended
by
a
black
slave
after
the
for
i
was
eager
to
expend
my
store
and
cared
not
for
the
great
heat
scarcely
had
we
passed
the
and
were
hurrying
on
to
shops
of
the
goldsmiths
and
jewellers
when
i
saw
an
old
man
a
beggar
in
a
dirty
yellow
turban
and
pieced
particoloured
and
linen
in
rags
his
other
gear
so
lean
was
he
and
looked
so
weak
that
i
wondered
he
did
other
than
lay
his
length
on
the
ground
and
as
he
asked
me
for
alms
his
voice
had
a
piteousness
that
made
me
to
weep
and
i
punished
my
slave
for
seeking
to
drive
him
away
and
gave
my
one
piece
of
gold
into
his
hand
then
he
asked
me
what
i
required
of
him
in
exchange
and
i
said
can
a
poor
old
man
that
is
a
beggar
give
he
laughed
and
asked
me
then
what
i
had
intended
to
buy
with
that
piece
of
money
so
beginning
to
regret
the
power
that
was
gone
from
me
of
commanding
with
my
gold
piece
this
and
that
fine
thing
i
mused
and
said
a
blue
dress
embroidered
with
gold
and
a
gold
crown
and
gold
bracelets
set
with
turquoise
stones
these
and
toys
but
could
i
buy
in
this
city
a
book
of
magic
that
were
my
purchase
the
old
fellow
smiled
and
said
to
my
black
slave
thou
hadst
thou
this
coin
what
were
thy
purchase
therewith
he
scoffing
the
old
beggar
answered
plaister
for
sores
as
broad
as
my
back
and
a
camel
hump
o
thou
old
villain
the
old
man
grunted
in
his
chest
and
said
art
but
a
camel
thyself
to
hinder
a
true
mussulman
from
passing
in
peace
down
a
street
of
oolb
so
a
good
purchase
and
a
fitting
thou
what
is
said
of
the
blessing
given
by
them
that
receive
a
charity
is
the
fertilizing
dew
that
streameth
after
the
sun
strong
as
the
breath
of
allah
to
bless
life
well
begun
so
is
my
blessing
on
the
little
damsel
and
she
shall
have
her
wish
wullahy
thou
black
face
and
thou
thine
this
spake
the
old
man
and
hobbled
off
while
my
slave
was
jeering
him
so
i
strolled
through
the
bazaars
and
thought
no
more
of
the
old
words
and
longed
to
purchase
a
hundred
fineries
and
came
to
the
confectioner
and
smelt
the
smell
of
his
sweetmeats
and
lemon
sweets
and
sugared
pistachios
that
are
delicious
to
crunch
between
the
teeth
my
mouth
watered
and
i
said
to
my
slave
kadrab
a
coin
though
small
would
give
us
privilege
in
yonder
shop
to
select
and
feast
and
approve
the
skill
of
the
confectioner
he
grinned
and
displayed
in
his
black
fist
a
petty
coin
of
exchange
but
would
not
let
me
have
it
till
i
had
sworn
to
give
no
more
away
to
beggars
so
even
as
we
were
hurrying
into
the
shop
another
old
beggar
wretcheder
than
the
first
fronted
me
and
i
was
moved
and
forgot
my
promise
to
kadrab
and
gave
him
the
money
then
was
kadrab
wroth
and
kicked
the
old
beggar
with
his
lifting
him
high
in
air
and
lo
he
did
not
alight
but
rose
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
beyond
the
city
till
he
was
but
a
speck
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
so
kadrab
bit
his
forefinger
amazed
and
glanced
at
his
foot
and
at
what
was
visible
of
the
old
beggarman
and
again
at
his
foot
thinking
but
of
what
he
had
done
with
it
and
the
might
manifested
in
that
kick
fool
that
he
was
all
the
way
homeward
he
kept
scanning
the
sky
and
lifting
his
foot
aloft
and
i
saw
him
bewildered
with
a
strange
conceit
as
the
poet
has
exclaimed
in
his
scorn
oh
world
diseased
oh
race
empirical
where
fools
are
the
fathers
of
every
miracle
now
when
i
was
in
my
chamber
what
saw
i
there
but
a
dress
of
very
costly
blue
raiment
with
broidery
and
a
lovely
circlet
of
gold
and
gold
bracelets
set
with
stones
of
turquoise
and
a
basket
of
gold
woven
wire
wherein
were
toys
wondrous
ones
soldiers
that
cut
off
each
other
heads
and
put
them
on
again
springing
antelopes
that
turned
to
fountains
and
others
and
lo
a
book
in
red
binding
with
figures
on
it
and
clasps
of
gold
a
great
book
so
i
clapped
my
hands
joyfully
crying
old
beggar
has
done
it
and
robed
myself
in
the
dress
and
ran
forth
to
tell
ravaloke
as
i
ran
by
a
window
looking
on
the
inner
court
i
saw
below
a
crowd
of
all
the
slaves
of
ravaloke
round
one
that
was
seeking
to
escape
from
them
and
was
kadrab
with
a
hump
on
his
back
and
a
broad
brown
plaister
over
it
the
wretch
howling
peering
across
his
shoulder
and
trying
to
bolt
from
his
burden
as
a
horse
that
would
run
from
his
rider
then
i
saw
that
kadrab
also
had
his
wish
his
camel
hump
and
thought
old
beggar
what
was
he
but
a
genie
surely
ravaloke
caressed
me
when
he
heard
of
the
adventure
and
what
had
befallen
kadrab
was
the
jest
of
the
city
but
for
me
i
spared
little
time
away
from
that
book
and
studied
in
it
incessantly
the
ways
and
windings
of
magic
till
i
could
hold
communication
with
genii
and
wield
charms
to
summon
them
and
utter
spells
that
subdue
them
discovering
the
haunts
of
talismans
that
enthral
afrites
and
are
powerful
among
men
there
was
that
kadrab
coming
to
me
daily
to
call
out
in
the
air
for
the
old
beggarman
to
rid
him
of
his
hump
and
he
would
waste
hours
looking
up
into
the
sky
moodily
for
him
and
cursing
the
five
toes
of
his
foot
for
he
doubted
not
the
two
beggars
were
one
and
that
he
was
punished
for
the
kick
and
lamented
it
direly
saying
in
the
thick
of
his
whimperings
give
the
foot
that
did
it
to
be
released
from
my
hump
o
my
fair
mistress
so
i
pitied
him
and
made
a
powder
and
a
spell
and
my
first
experiment
in
magic
was
to
relieve
kadrab
of
his
hump
and
i
succeeded
in
loosening
it
and
it
came
away
from
him
and
sank
into
the
ground
of
the
garden
where
we
stood
so
i
told
kadrab
to
say
nothing
of
this
but
the
fellow
blabbed
it
over
the
city
and
it
came
to
the
ears
of
goorelka
then
she
sent
for
me
to
visit
her
and
by
the
advice
of
ravaloke
i
went
and
she
fondled
me
and
sought
to
get
at
the
depth
of
my
knowledge
by
a
spell
that
tieth
every
faculty
save
the
tongue
and
it
is
the
spell
of
vain
longing
now
because
i
baffled
her
arts
she
knew
me
more
cunning
than
i
seemed
and
as
night
advanced
she
affected
to
be
possessed
with
pleasure
in
me
and
took
me
in
her
arms
and
sought
to
fascinate
me
and
i
heard
her
mutter
once
i
doubt
the
warning
of
karaz
so
presently
she
said
with
me
and
i
went
with
her
under
the
curtain
of
that
apartment
into
another
a
long
saloon
wherein
were
couches
round
a
fountain
and
beyond
it
an
aviary
lit
with
lamps
when
we
were
there
she
whistled
and
immediately
there
was
a
concert
of
birds
a
wondrous
accord
of
exquisite
piping
and
she
leaned
on
a
couch
and
took
me
by
her
to
listen
sweet
and
passionate
was
the
harmony
of
the
birds
but
i
let
not
my
faculties
lull
and
observed
that
round
the
throat
of
every
bird
was
a
ringed
mark
of
gold
and
stamps
of
divers
gems
similar
in
colour
to
a
ring
on
the
forefinger
of
her
right
hand
which
she
dazzled
my
sight
with
as
she
flashed
it
when
we
had
listened
a
long
hour
to
this
music
the
princess
gazed
on
me
as
if
to
mark
the
effect
of
a
charm
and
i
saw
disappointment
on
her
lovely
face
and
she
bit
her
lip
and
looked
spiteful
saying
art
far
gone
in
the
use
of
magic
and
wary
o
girl
then
she
laughed
unnaturally
and
called
slaves
to
bring
in
sweet
drinks
to
us
and
i
drank
with
her
and
became
less
wary
and
she
fondled
me
more
calling
me
tender
names
heaping
endearments
on
me
and
as
the
hour
of
the
approached
i
was
losing
all
suspicion
in
deep
languor
and
sighed
at
the
song
of
the
birds
the
long
and
dozed
awake
with
eyes
half
shut
i
felt
her
steal
from
me
and
continued
still
motionless
without
alarm
so
was
i
mastered
what
hour
it
was
or
what
time
had
passed
i
can
not
say
when
a
bird
that
was
chained
on
a
perch
before
me
a
very
quaint
bird
with
a
topknot
awry
and
black
heavy
bill
and
ragged
gorgeousness
of
plumage
the
only
object
between
my
lids
and
darkness
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
singing
let
loose
a
hoarse
laugh
that
was
followed
by
peals
of
laughter
from
the
other
birds
thereat
i
started
up
and
beheld
the
princess
standing
over
a
brazier
and
she
seized
a
slipper
from
her
foot
and
flung
it
at
the
bird
that
had
first
laughed
and
struck
him
off
his
perch
and
went
to
him
and
seized
him
and
shook
him
crying
to
laugh
again
and
he
kept
clearing
his
throat
and
trying
to
catch
the
tune
he
had
lost
pitching
a
high
note
and
a
low
note
but
the
marvel
of
this
laughter
of
the
bird
wakened
me
thoroughly
and
i
thanked
the
bird
in
my
soul
and
said
to
goorelka
wondrous
than
their
singing
this
laughter
o
princess
she
would
not
speak
till
she
had
beaten
every
bird
in
the
aviary
and
then
said
in
the
words
of
the
poet
shall
they
that
deal
in
magic
match
degrees
of
wonder
from
the
bosom
of
one
cloud
comes
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
then
said
she
noorna
i
tell
thee
truly
my
intent
which
was
to
enchant
thee
but
i
find
thee
wise
so
let
us
join
our
powers
and
thou
shah
become
mighty
as
a
sorceress
now
ravaloke
had
said
to
me
friendship
is
fire
her
enmity
frost
so
be
cold
to
the
former
to
the
latter
hot
and
i
dissembled
and
replied
me
o
princess
so
she
asked
me
what
i
could
do
could
i
plant
a
mountain
in
the
sea
and
people
it
could
i
anchor
a
purple
cloud
under
the
sun
and
live
there
a
year
with
them
i
delighted
in
could
i
fix
the
eyes
of
the
world
upon
one
head
and
make
the
nations
bow
to
it
change
men
to
birds
fishes
to
men
and
so
on
a
hundred
sorceries
that
i
had
never
attempted
and
dreamed
not
of
my
betrothed
i
had
never
offended
allah
by
a
misuse
of
my
powers
when
i
told
her
she
cried
art
then
of
a
surety
she
that
fitted
for
the
custody
of
the
lily
of
the
light
so
come
with
me
now
i
had
heard
of
the
lily
even
this
thou
holdest
may
its
influence
be
unwithering
and
desired
to
see
it
so
she
led
me
from
the
palace
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
and
flung
a
cockleshell
on
the
waters
and
seated
herself
in
it
with
me
in
her
lap
and
we
scudded
over
the
waters
and
entered
this
enchanted
sea
and
stood
by
the
lily
then
i
that
loved
flowers
undertook
the
custody
of
this
one
knowing
not
the
consequences
and
the
depth
of
her
wiles
is
truly
said
the
overwise
themselves
hoodwink
for
simple
eyesight
is
a
modest
thing
they
on
the
black
abysm
brink
smile
and
but
when
they
fall
bitterly
think
what
difference
the
fool
and
me
creation
king
nevertheless
for
awhile
nothing
evil
resulted
and
i
had
great
joy
in
the
flower
and
tended
it
with
exceeding
watchfulness
and
loved
it
so
that
i
was
brought
in
my
heart
to
thank
the
princess
and
think
well
of
her
now
one
summer
eve
as
ravaloke
rested
under
the
shade
of
his
garden
palm
and
i
studied
beside
him
great
volumes
of
magic
it
happened
that
after
i
had
read
certain
pages
i
closed
one
of
the
books
marked
on
the
cover
and
shut
the
clasp
louder
than
i
intended
so
that
he
who
was
dozing
started
up
and
his
head
was
in
the
sloped
sun
in
an
instant
and
i
observed
the
shadow
of
his
head
lengthen
out
along
the
towards
the
mossed
wall
and
it
shot
up
the
wall
darkening
it
then
drawing
back
and
lessening
then
darting
forth
like
a
beast
of
darkness
irritable
for
prey
i
was
troubled
for
whatso
is
seen
while
the
volume
alif
is
in
use
hath
a
portent
but
the
discovery
of
what
this
might
be
baffled
me
so
i
determined
to
watch
events
and
it
was
not
many
days
ere
ravaloke
who
was
the
leader
of
the
armies
of
the
king
of
oolb
was
called
forth
to
subdue
certain
revolted
tributaries
of
the
king
and
at
my
entreaty
took
me
with
him
and
i
saw
battles
and
encounters
lasting
a
day
length
once
we
were
encamped
in
a
fruitful
country
by
a
brook
running
with
a
bright
eye
between
green
banks
and
i
that
had
freedom
and
the
password
of
the
camp
wandered
down
to
it
and
refreshed
my
forehead
with
its
coolness
so
as
i
looked
under
the
falling
drops
lo
on
the
opposite
bank
the
old
beggar
that
had
given
me
such
fair
return
for
my
alms
and
kadrab
his
hump
i
heard
him
call
night
is
the
key
to
the
mystery
and
he
was
gone
every
incantation
i
uttered
was
insufficient
to
bring
him
back
surely
i
hurried
to
the
tents
and
took
no
sleep
watching
zealously
by
the
tent
of
ravaloke
crouched
in
its
shadow
about
the
time
of
the
setting
of
the
moon
i
heard
footsteps
approach
the
tent
within
the
circle
of
the
guard
and
it
was
a
youth
that
held
in
his
hand
naked
steel
when
he
was
by
the
threshold
of
the
tent
i
rose
before
him
and
beheld
the
favourite
of
ravaloke
even
the
youth
he
had
destined
to
espouse
me
so
i
reproached
him
and
he
wept
denying
not
the
intention
he
had
to
assassinate
ravaloke
and
when
his
soul
was
softened
he
confessed
to
me
that
i
might
win
the
princess
goorelka
and
she
urged
me
to
it
promising
the
king
would
promote
me
to
the
vacant
post
of
ravaloke
then
i
said
to
him
thou
goorelka
and
he
answered
though
i
know
my
doom
in
loving
her
and
that
it
will
be
the
doom
of
them
now
piping
to
her
pleasure
and
denied
the
privilege
of
laughter
so
i
thought
cruel
sorceress
the
birds
are
men
and
as
i
mused
my
breast
melted
with
pity
at
their
desire
to
laugh
and
the
little
restraint
they
had
upon
themselves
notwithstanding
her
harshness
for
could
they
think
of
their
changed
condition
and
folly
without
laughter
and
the
folly
that
sent
them
fresh
mates
in
misery
was
indeed
matter
for
laughter
fed
to
fulness
by
constant
meditation
on
the
perch
meantime
i
uncharmed
the
youth
and
bade
him
retire
quickly
but
as
he
was
going
he
said
of
the
genie
karaz
then
i
held
him
back
and
after
a
parley
he
told
me
what
he
had
heard
the
princess
say
and
it
was
that
karaz
had
seen
me
and
sworn
to
possess
me
for
my
beauty
smiled
goorelka
when
she
spake
that
said
he
now
the
city
of
oolb
fronts
the
sea
and
behind
it
is
a
mountain
and
a
wood
where
the
king
met
ravaloke
on
his
return
victorious
over
the
rebels
so
to
escape
the
eye
of
the
king
i
parted
with
ravaloke
and
sought
to
enter
the
city
by
a
circuitous
way
but
the
paths
wound
about
and
zigzagged
and
my
slaves
suffered
nightfall
to
surprise
us
in
the
entanglements
of
the
wood
i
sent
them
in
different
directions
to
strike
into
the
main
path
retaining
kadrab
at
the
bridle
of
my
mule
but
that
creature
now
began
to
address
me
in
a
familiar
tone
and
he
said
something
of
love
for
me
that
enraged
me
so
that
i
hit
him
a
blow
then
came
from
him
sounds
like
the
neighing
of
mares
and
lo
he
seized
me
and
rose
with
me
in
the
air
and
i
thought
the
very
heavens
were
opening
to
that
black
beast
when
on
a
sudden
he
paused
and
shot
down
with
me
from
heights
of
the
stars
to
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
by
the
putrid
sea
and
dragged
me
into
a
cavern
greatly
illuminated
hung
like
a
palace
chamber
and
supported
on
pillars
of
shining
jasper
then
i
fell
upon
the
floor
in
a
swoon
and
awaking
saw
kadrab
no
longer
but
in
his
place
a
genie
o
my
soul
thou
halt
seen
him
i
thought
at
once
karaz
and
when
he
said
to
me
is
thy
abode
o
lady
and
i
he
that
have
sworn
to
possess
thee
from
the
hour
i
saw
thee
in
the
chamber
of
goorelka
then
was
i
certain
was
karaz
so
collecting
the
strength
of
my
soul
i
said
in
the
words
of
the
poet
not
a
heart
preoccupied
what
thorn
is
like
a
loathing
bride
mark
ye
the
shrubs
how
they
turn
from
the
sea
the
sea
rough
whispers
shun
but
like
the
sun
of
heaven
be
and
every
flower
will
open
wide
woo
with
the
shining
patience
we
beheld
in
heaven
sun
then
he
sang
exquisite
lady
name
the
smart
that
fills
thy
heart
thou
art
the
foot
and
i
the
worm
prescribe
the
term
finding
him
compliant
i
said
great
genie
truly
the
search
of
my
life
has
been
to
discover
him
that
is
my
father
and
how
i
was
left
in
the
wilderness
there
no
peace
for
me
nor
understanding
the
word
of
love
till
i
hear
by
whom
i
was
left
a
babe
on
the
bosom
of
a
dead
mother
he
exclaimed
and
his
eyes
twinkled
that
that
shalt
thou
know
in
a
span
of
time
o
my
mistress
hast
thou
seen
the
birds
of
goorelka
thy
father
feshnavat
is
among
them
perched
like
a
bird
so
i
cried
tell
me
how
he
may
be
disenchanted
he
said
first
to
be
mine
unreluctantly
then
i
said
is
thy
oath
he
answered
swear
when
i
swear
by
the
identical
thereupon
i
questioned
him
concerning
the
identical
what
it
was
and
he
not
suspecting
revealed
to
me
the
mighty
hair
in
his
head
now
in
the
head
of
shagpat
even
that
so
i
swore
by
that
to
give
myself
to
the
possessor
of
the
identical
and
flattered
him
then
said
he
lovely
damsel
i
am
truly
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
genii
yet
am
i
in
bondage
to
that
sorceress
goorelka
by
reason
of
a
ring
she
holdeth
and
could
i
get
that
ring
from
her
and
be
slave
to
nothing
mortal
an
hour
i
could
light
creation
as
a
torch
and
broil
the
inhabitants
of
earth
at
one
fire
i
thought
ring
is
known
to
me
and
he
continued
i
can
not
assist
thee
in
this
work
other
than
by
revealing
the
means
of
disenchantment
and
it
is
to
keep
the
birds
laughing
uninterruptedly
an
hour
then
are
they
men
again
and
take
the
forms
of
men
that
are
laughers
i
know
not
why
so
i
cried
well
carry
me
back
to
oolb
then
the
genie
lifted
me
into
the
air
and
ceased
not
speeding
rapidly
through
it
till
i
was
on
the
roof
of
the
house
of
ravaloke
o
sweet
youth
moon
of
my
soul
from
that
time
to
the
disenchantment
of
feshnavat
i
pored
over
my
books
trying
experiments
in
magic
dreadful
ones
hunting
for
talismans
to
countervail
goorelka
but
her
power
was
great
and
was
not
in
me
to
get
her
away
from
the
birds
one
hour
to
free
them
on
a
certain
occasion
i
had
stolen
to
them
and
kept
them
laughing
with
stories
of
man
to
within
an
instant
of
the
hour
and
they
were
laughing
exultingly
with
the
easy
happy
laugh
of
them
that
perceive
deliverance
sure
when
she
burst
in
and
beat
them
even
to
the
door
of
death
i
saw
too
in
her
eyes
that
glowed
like
the
eyes
of
wild
cats
in
the
dark
she
suspected
me
and
i
called
allah
to
aid
the
just
cause
against
the
sinful
and
prepared
to
war
with
her
now
my
desire
which
was
to
liberate
my
father
and
his
fellows
in
tribulation
i
knew
pure
and
had
no
fear
of
the
sequel
as
is
declared
fear
nought
so
much
as
fear
itself
for
arm
with
fear
the
foe
finds
passage
to
the
vital
part
and
strikes
a
double
blow
so
one
day
as
i
leaned
from
my
casement
looking
on
the
garden
seaward
i
saw
a
strange
red
and
bird
that
flew
to
the
branch
of
a
opposite
with
a
ring
in
its
beak
and
the
bird
was
singing
and
with
every
note
the
ring
dropped
from
its
bill
and
it
descended
swiftly
in
an
arrowy
slant
downward
and
seized
it
ere
it
reached
the
ground
and
commenced
singing
afresh
when
i
had
marked
this
to
happen
many
times
i
thought
like
is
this
bird
to
an
innocent
soul
possessed
of
magic
and
using
its
powers
lo
it
seeketh
still
to
sing
as
one
of
the
careless
and
can
not
relinquish
the
ring
and
be
as
the
careless
and
between
the
two
there
is
neither
peace
for
it
nor
pleasure
now
while
my
eyes
were
on
the
pretty
bird
dwelling
on
it
i
saw
it
struck
suddenly
by
an
arrow
beneath
the
left
wing
and
the
bird
fluttered
to
my
bosom
and
dropped
in
it
the
ring
from
its
beak
then
it
sprang
weakly
and
sought
to
fly
and
soar
and
fluttered
but
a
blue
film
lodged
over
its
eyes
and
its
panting
was
quickly
ended
so
i
looked
at
the
ring
and
knew
it
for
that
one
i
had
noted
on
the
finger
of
goorelka
red
blushed
my
bliss
and
was
revealed
to
me
that
the
bird
was
of
the
birds
of
the
princess
that
had
escaped
from
her
with
the
ring
i
buried
the
bird
weeping
for
it
and
flew
to
my
books
and
as
i
read
a
glow
stole
over
me
o
my
betrothed
eyes
of
my
soul
i
read
that
the
possessor
of
that
ring
was
mistress
of
the
marvellous
hair
which
is
a
magnet
to
the
homage
of
men
so
that
they
crowd
and
crush
and
hunger
to
adore
it
even
the
identical
this
was
the
power
that
peopled
the
aviary
of
goorelka
and
had
conquered
all
the
resistance
of
my
craft
now
while
i
read
there
arose
a
hubbub
and
noise
in
the
outer
court
and
shrieks
of
slaves
the
noise
approached
with
rapid
strides
and
before
i
could
close
my
books
goorelka
burst
in
upon
me
crying
noorna
wild
and
haggard
was
her
head
and
she
rushed
to
my
books
and
saw
them
open
at
the
sign
of
the
ring
then
began
our
combat
she
menaced
me
as
never
mortal
was
menaced
rapid
were
her
transformations
and
she
was
a
serpent
a
scorpion
a
lizard
a
lioness
in
succession
but
i
leapt
perpetually
into
fresh
rings
of
fire
and
of
witched
water
and
at
the
fiftieth
transformation
she
fell
on
the
floor
exhausted
a
shuddering
heap
seeing
that
i
ran
from
her
to
the
aviary
in
her
palace
and
hurried
over
a
story
of
men
to
the
birds
that
rocked
them
on
their
perches
with
chestquakes
of
irresistible
laughter
then
flew
i
back
to
the
princess
and
she
still
puffing
on
the
floor
commenced
wheedling
and
begging
the
ring
of
me
stinting
no
promises
at
last
she
cried
what
is
this
ring
to
thee
without
beauty
thy
beauty
is
in
my
keeping
and
i
exclaimed
how
smitten
to
the
soul
she
answered
and
i
can
wear
it
as
my
own
adding
it
to
my
own
when
a
hag
my
betrothed
i
was
on
the
verge
of
giving
her
the
ring
for
this
secret
when
a
violent
remote
laughter
filled
the
inner
hollow
of
my
ears
and
it
increased
till
the
princess
heard
it
and
now
the
light
of
my
casement
was
darkened
with
birds
the
birds
of
goorelka
laughing
as
on
a
wind
of
laughter
so
i
opened
to
them
and
they
darted
in
laughing
all
of
them
till
i
could
hold
out
no
longer
and
the
infection
of
laughter
seized
me
and
i
rolled
with
it
and
the
princess
she
too
laughed
a
under
a
cat
grin
and
we
all
of
us
remained
in
this
wise
some
minutes
laughing
the
breath
out
of
our
bodies
as
if
death
would
take
us
whoso
in
the
city
of
oolb
heard
us
the
slaves
the
people
and
the
king
laughed
knowing
not
the
cause
this
day
is
still
remembered
in
oolb
as
the
day
of
laughter
now
at
a
stroke
of
the
hour
the
laughter
ceased
and
i
saw
in
the
chamber
a
crowd
of
youths
and
elders
of
various
ranks
but
their
visages
were
become
long
and
solemn
as
that
of
them
that
have
seen
a
dark
experience
is
certain
they
laughed
little
in
their
lives
from
that
time
and
the
muscles
of
their
cheeks
had
rest
so
i
caught
down
my
veil
and
cried
to
the
princess
father
is
among
these
point
him
out
to
me
ere
she
replied
one
stepped
forth
even
feshnavat
my
father
and
called
me
by
name
and
knew
me
by
a
spot
on
the
left
arm
and
made
himself
known
to
me
and
told
me
the
story
of
my
dead
mother
how
she
had
missed
her
way
from
the
caravan
in
the
desert
and
he
searching
her
was
set
upon
by
robbers
and
borne
on
their
expeditions
nothing
said
he
of
the
sorceries
of
goorelka
and
i
not
wishing
to
provoke
the
princess
suffered
his
dread
to
exist
so
i
kissed
him
and
bowed
my
head
to
him
and
she
fled
from
the
sight
of
innocent
happiness
then
took
i
the
ring
and
summoned
karaz
and
ordered
him
to
reinstate
all
those
princes
and
chiefs
and
officers
in
their
possessions
and
powers
on
what
part
of
earth
soever
that
might
be
never
till
i
stood
as
the
lily
and
thy
voice
sweetened
the
name
of
love
in
my
ears
heard
i
aught
of
delicate
delightfulness
like
the
sound
of
their
gratitude
many
wooed
me
to
let
them
stay
by
me
and
guard
me
and
do
service
all
their
lives
to
me
but
this
i
would
not
allow
and
though
they
were
fair
as
moons
some
of
them
i
responded
not
to
their
soft
glances
speaking
calmly
the
word
of
farewell
for
i
was
burdened
with
other
thoughts
now
when
the
genie
had
done
my
bidding
he
returned
to
me
joyfully
my
soul
sickened
to
think
myself
his
by
a
promise
but
i
revolved
the
words
of
my
promise
and
saw
in
them
a
loophole
of
escape
so
when
he
claimed
me
i
said
ay
lay
thy
head
in
my
lap
as
if
my
mind
treasured
it
then
he
lay
there
and
revealed
to
me
his
plans
for
the
destruction
of
men
said
he
shall
be
our
slaves
and
for
there
now
no
restraint
on
me
now
thou
art
mistress
of
the
ring
and
mine
thereupon
his
imagination
swelled
and
he
saw
his
evil
will
enthroned
and
the
hopes
of
men
beneath
his
heel
crying
the
more
i
crush
them
the
thicker
they
crowd
for
the
identical
compelleth
their
very
souls
to
adore
in
spite
of
distaste
then
said
i
me
o
genie
is
the
identical
subservient
to
me
in
another
head
save
thine
he
answered
i
in
another
head
is
a
counteraction
to
the
power
of
the
ring
the
ring
powerless
over
it
and
i
said
it
live
in
a
head
the
identical
cried
he
to
what
else
holdeth
it
i
whispered
in
his
hairy
pointed
red
ear
sleep
and
lulled
him
with
a
song
and
he
slept
being
weary
with
my
commissioning
then
i
bade
feshnavat
my
father
fetch
me
one
of
my
books
of
magic
and
read
in
it
of
the
discovery
of
the
identical
by
means
of
the
ring
and
i
took
the
ring
and
hung
it
on
a
hair
of
my
own
head
over
the
head
of
the
genie
and
saw
one
of
the
thin
lengths
begin
to
twist
and
dart
and
writhe
and
shift
lustres
as
a
creature
in
anguish
so
i
put
the
ring
on
my
forefinger
and
turned
the
hair
round
and
round
it
and
tugged
lo
with
a
noise
that
stunned
me
the
hair
came
out
o
my
betrothed
what
shrieks
and
roars
were
those
with
which
the
genie
awoke
finding
himself
bare
of
the
identical
oolb
heard
them
and
the
sea
foamed
like
the
mouth
of
madness
as
the
genie
sped
over
it
following
me
in
such
a
flight
was
that
now
i
found
it
not
possible
to
hold
the
identical
for
it
twisted
and
stung
and
was
nigh
slipping
from
me
while
i
flew
i
saw
white
on
a
corner
of
the
desert
a
city
and
i
descended
on
it
by
the
shop
of
a
clothier
that
sat
quietly
by
his
goods
and
stuffs
thinking
of
fate
less
than
of
kabobs
and
stews
and
rare
seasonings
that
city
hath
now
his
name
wullahy
had
i
not
then
sown
in
his
head
that
hair
which
he
weareth
yet
how
had
i
escaped
karaz
and
met
thee
wondrous
are
the
decrees
of
providence
praise
be
to
allah
for
them
so
the
genie
when
he
found
himself
baffled
by
me
and
shagpat
with
the
mighty
hair
in
his
head
the
identical
he
yelled
and
fetched
shagpat
a
slap
that
sent
him
into
the
middle
of
the
street
but
kadza
screamed
after
him
and
there
was
immediately
such
lamentation
in
the
city
about
shagpat
and
such
tearing
of
hair
about
him
that
i
perceived
at
once
the
virtue
that
was
in
the
identical
as
for
karaz
finding
his
claim
as
possessor
of
the
identical
no
more
valid
he
vanished
and
has
been
my
rebellious
slave
since
till
thou
o
my
betrothed
me
spend
him
in
curing
thy
folly
on
the
horse
garraveen
and
he
escaped
from
my
circles
beyond
the
dominion
of
the
ring
yet
had
he
his
revenge
for
i
that
was
keeper
of
the
lily
had
i
now
learned
ruefully
a
bond
of
beauty
with
it
and
whatever
was
a
stain
to
one
withered
the
other
then
that
sorceress
goorelka
stole
my
beauty
from
me
by
sprinkling
a
blight
on
the
petals
of
the
fair
flower
and
i
became
as
thou
first
me
but
what
am
i
as
i
now
am
blissful
blissful
surely
i
grew
humble
with
the
loss
of
beauty
and
by
humility
wise
so
that
i
assisted
feshnavat
to
become
vizier
by
the
ring
and
watched
for
thy
coming
to
shave
shagpat
as
a
star
watcheth
for
is
written
barber
alone
shall
be
shearer
of
the
identical
and
he
only
my
betrothed
hath
power
to
plant
it
in
aklis
where
it
groweth
as
a
pillar
bringing
due
reverence
to
aklis
the
wiles
of
rabesqurat
now
when
noorna
bin
noorka
had
made
an
end
of
her
narration
she
folded
her
hands
and
was
mute
awhile
and
to
the
ear
of
shibli
bagarag
it
seemed
as
if
a
sweet
instrument
had
on
a
sudden
ceased
luting
so
as
he
leaned
listening
for
her
voice
to
recommence
she
said
quickly
yonder
fire
on
the
mountain
height
he
looked
and
saw
a
great
light
on
the
summit
of
a
lofty
mountain
before
them
then
said
she
is
aklis
and
it
is
ablaze
knowing
a
visitant
near
tighten
now
the
hairs
of
garraveen
about
thy
wrist
touch
thy
lips
with
the
waters
of
paravid
hold
before
thee
the
lily
and
make
ready
to
enter
the
mountain
lo
my
betrothed
thou
art
in
possession
of
the
three
means
that
melt
opposition
and
the
fault
is
thine
if
thou
fail
he
did
as
she
directed
and
they
were
taken
on
a
tide
and
advanced
rapidly
to
the
mountain
so
that
the
waters
smacked
and
crackled
beneath
the
shell
covering
it
with
silver
showering
arches
of
glittering
spray
then
the
fair
beams
of
the
moon
became
obscured
and
the
twain
reddened
with
the
reflection
of
the
fire
and
the
billows
waxed
like
riotous
flames
and
presently
the
shell
rose
upon
the
peak
of
many
waves
swollen
to
one
and
looking
below
they
saw
in
the
scarlet
abyss
of
waters
at
their
feet
a
monstrous
fish
with
open
jaws
and
one
baleful
eye
and
the
fish
was
lengthy
as
a
caravan
winding
through
the
desert
and
covered
with
fiery
scales
shibli
bagarag
heard
the
voice
of
noorna
shriek
affrightedly
and
as
they
were
sliding
on
the
down
slope
she
stood
upright
in
the
shell
pronouncing
rapidly
some
words
in
magic
and
the
shell
closed
upon
them
both
pressing
them
together
and
writing
darkness
on
their
very
eyeballs
so
while
they
were
thus
they
felt
themselves
gulped
in
and
borne
forward
with
terrible
swiftness
they
knew
not
where
like
one
that
hath
a
dream
of
sinking
and
outside
the
shell
a
rushing
gurgling
noise
and
a
noise
as
of
shouting
multitudes
and
muffled
multitudes
muttering
complaints
and
yells
and
querulous
cries
told
them
they
were
yet
speeding
through
the
body
of
the
depths
in
the
belly
of
the
fish
then
there
came
a
shock
and
the
shell
was
struck
with
light
and
they
were
sensible
of
stillness
without
motion
then
a
blow
on
the
shell
shivered
it
to
fragments
and
they
were
blinded
with
seas
of
brilliancy
on
all
sides
from
lamps
and
tapers
and
crystals
cornelians
and
gems
of
fiery
lustre
liquid
lights
and
flashing
mirrors
and
eyes
of
crowding
damsels
bright
ones
so
when
they
had
risen
and
could
bear
to
gaze
on
the
insufferable
splendour
they
saw
sitting
on
a
throne
of
coral
and
surrounded
by
slaves
with
scimitars
a
fair
queen
with
black
eyes
kindlers
of
storms
torches
in
the
tempest
and
with
floating
tresses
crowned
with
a
circlet
of
precious
stones
and
masses
of
crimson
weed
with
flaps
of
pearl
and
she
was
robed
with
a
robe
of
amber
and
had
saffron
sandals
loose
trousers
tied
in
at
the
ankle
the
ankle
white
as
silver
wonderful
was
the
quivering
of
rays
from
the
jewels
upon
her
when
she
but
moved
a
finger
now
as
they
stood
with
their
hands
across
their
brows
she
cried
out
ye
traversers
of
my
sea
how
is
this
that
i
am
made
to
thank
karaz
for
a
sight
of
ye
and
noorna
bin
noorka
answered
o
queen
rabesqurat
the
haven
of
our
voyage
was
aklis
and
we
feared
delay
seeing
the
fire
of
the
mountain
ablaze
with
expectations
of
us
then
the
queen
cried
angrily
well
thou
hadst
wit
to
close
the
shell
o
noorna
or
there
would
have
been
delay
indeed
say
is
not
the
road
to
aklis
through
my
palace
and
it
is
the
road
thousands
travel
so
noorna
bin
noorka
said
queen
this
do
they
but
are
they
of
them
that
reach
aklis
and
the
queen
cried
violently
purpling
with
passion
to
me
when
i
helped
ye
to
the
plucking
of
the
lily
now
the
queen
muttered
an
imprecation
and
called
the
name
and
lo
a
door
opened
in
one
of
the
pillars
of
jasper
leading
from
the
throne
and
there
came
forth
a
little
man
humped
with
legs
like
bows
and
arms
reaching
to
his
feet
in
his
hand
a
net
weighted
with
leaden
weights
so
the
queen
levelled
her
finger
at
noorna
and
he
spun
the
net
above
her
head
and
dropped
it
on
her
shoulder
and
dragged
her
with
him
to
the
pillar
when
shibli
bagarag
saw
that
the
world
darkened
to
him
and
he
rushed
upon
abarak
but
noorna
called
swiftly
in
his
ear
wait
thou
by
thy
spells
art
stronger
than
all
here
save
abarak
be
true
remember
the
seventh
pillar
then
with
a
spurn
from
the
hand
of
abarak
the
youth
fell
back
senseless
at
the
feet
of
the
queen
now
with
the
return
of
consciousness
his
hearing
was
bewitched
with
strange
delicious
melodies
the
touch
of
stringed
instruments
and
others
breathed
into
softly
as
by
the
breath
of
love
delicate
tender
alive
with
enamoured
bashfulness
surely
the
soul
that
heard
them
dissolved
like
a
sweet
in
the
goblet
mingling
with
so
much
ecstasy
of
sound
and
those
melodies
filling
the
white
cave
of
the
ear
were
even
at
once
to
drown
the
soul
in
delightfulness
and
buoy
it
with
bliss
as
a
leaved
flower
is
withered
and
refreshed
by
sun
and
dews
surely
the
youth
ceased
not
to
listen
and
oblivion
of
cares
and
aught
other
in
this
life
save
that
hidden
luting
and
piping
pillowed
his
drowsy
head
at
last
there
was
a
pause
and
it
seemed
every
maze
of
music
had
been
wandered
through
opening
his
eyes
hurriedly
as
with
the
loss
of
the
music
his
own
breath
had
gone
likewise
he
beheld
a
garden
golden
with
the
light
of
lamps
hung
profusely
from
branches
and
twigs
of
trees
by
the
glowing
cheeks
of
fruits
apple
and
grape
pomegranate
and
quince
and
he
was
reclining
on
a
bank
piled
with
purple
cushions
his
limbs
clad
in
the
richest
figured
silks
fringed
like
the
ends
of
clouds
round
the
sun
with
amber
fringes
he
started
up
striving
to
recall
the
confused
memory
of
his
adventures
and
what
evil
had
befallen
him
and
he
would
have
struggled
with
the
vision
of
these
glories
but
it
mastered
him
with
the
strength
of
a
potent
drug
so
that
the
very
name
of
his
betrothed
was
forgotten
by
him
and
he
knew
not
whither
he
would
or
the
thing
he
wished
for
now
when
he
had
risen
from
the
soft
green
bank
that
was
his
couch
lo
at
his
feet
a
damsel
weeping
so
he
lifted
her
by
the
hand
and
she
arose
and
looked
at
him
and
began
plaining
of
love
and
its
tyrannies
softening
him
already
softened
then
said
she
i
suffer
there
is
another
lovelier
than
i
suffering
thou
the
cause
of
it
o
cruel
youth
he
said
o
damsel
what
of
my
cruelty
surely
i
know
nothing
of
it
but
she
exclaimed
worse
to
feign
forgetfulness
now
he
was
bewildered
at
the
words
of
the
damsel
and
followed
her
leading
till
they
entered
a
dell
in
the
garden
canopied
with
foliage
and
beyond
it
a
green
rise
and
on
the
rise
a
throne
so
he
looked
earnestly
and
beheld
thereon
queen
rabesqurat
she
sobbing
her
dark
hair
pouring
in
streams
from
the
crown
of
her
head
seeing
him
she
cleared
her
eyes
and
advanced
to
meet
him
timidly
and
with
hesitating
steps
but
he
shrank
from
her
and
the
queen
shrieked
with
grief
crying
there
in
this
cold
heart
no
relenting
then
she
said
to
him
winningly
and
in
a
low
voice
youth
my
husband
to
whom
i
am
a
bride
he
marvelled
saying
is
a
game
for
indeed
i
am
no
husband
neither
have
i
a
bride
yet
have
i
confused
memory
of
some
betrothal
thereupon
she
cried
i
not
so
and
i
the
betrothed
still
he
exclaimed
can
not
think
it
wullahy
it
were
a
wonder
so
she
said
how
a
poor
youth
of
excellent
proportions
came
to
a
flourishing
court
before
one
a
widowed
queen
and
she
cast
eyes
of
love
on
him
and
gave
him
rule
over
her
and
all
that
was
hers
when
he
had
achieved
a
task
and
they
were
wedded
oh
the
bliss
of
it
knit
together
with
bond
and
a
writing
and
these
were
the
dominions
i
the
queen
woe
me
thou
the
youth
now
he
was
roiled
by
the
enchantments
of
the
queen
caught
in
the
snare
of
her
beguilings
and
he
let
her
lead
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
on
the
throne
and
sat
there
awhile
in
the
midst
of
feastings
mazed
thinking
life
have
i
lived
before
this
if
the
matter
be
as
i
behold
thinking
true
i
have
had
visions
of
a
widowed
queen
and
i
a
poor
youth
that
came
to
her
court
and
espoused
her
sitting
in
the
vacant
seat
beside
her
ruling
a
realm
but
it
was
a
dream
a
dream
yet
wah
here
is
she
here
am
i
yonder
my
dominions
then
he
thought
will
solve
it
so
on
a
sudden
he
said
to
her
beside
him
queen
sovereign
of
hearts
enlighten
me
as
to
a
perplexity
she
answered
voice
of
my
lord
is
music
in
the
ear
of
the
bride
then
said
he
in
the
tone
of
one
doubting
realities
fair
queen
is
there
truly
now
such
a
one
as
shagpat
in
the
world
she
laughed
at
his
speech
and
the
puzzled
appearance
of
his
visage
replying
there
liveth
one
shagpat
by
name
in
the
world
strange
is
the
history
of
him
his
friends
and
enemies
and
it
would
bear
recital
then
he
said
one
the
daughter
of
a
vizier
vizier
to
the
king
in
the
city
of
shagpat
thereat
she
shook
her
head
saying
know
nought
of
that
one
now
shibli
bagarag
was
mindful
of
his
thwackings
and
in
this
the
wisdom
of
noorna
is
manifest
that
the
sting
of
them
yet
chased
away
doubts
of
illusion
regarding
their
having
been
as
the
poet
says
if
thou
wouldst
fix
remembrance
thwack
is
that
oblivion
controls
i
care
not
be
on
the
back
or
on
the
soles
he
thought
yet
feel
i
the
thong
and
the
hiss
of
it
as
of
the
serpent
in
the
descent
and
the
smack
of
it
as
the
mouth
of
satisfaction
in
its
contact
with
tender
regions
this
wullahy
was
no
dream
nevertheless
he
was
ashamed
to
allude
thereto
before
the
queen
and
he
said
my
mistress
another
question
one
only
this
shagpat
is
he
shaved
she
said
shorn
quoth
he
astonished
with
drawn
lips
which
hand
chosen
above
men
and
she
exclaimed
thou
witty
one
that
feignest
not
to
know
wullahy
by
this
hand
of
thine
o
my
lord
and
king
daring
that
it
is
dexterous
surely
so
and
the
shaving
of
shagpat
was
the
task
achieved
i
the
dower
of
it
and
the
rich
reward
now
he
was
meshed
yet
deeper
in
the
net
of
her
subtleties
and
by
her
calling
him
and
king
and
she
gave
a
signal
for
fresh
entertainments
exhausting
the
resources
of
her
art
the
mines
of
her
wealth
to
fascinate
him
ravishments
of
design
and
taste
were
on
every
side
and
he
was
in
the
lap
of
abundance
beguiled
by
magic
caressed
by
beauty
and
a
queen
marvel
not
that
he
was
dazzled
and
imagined
himself
already
come
to
the
great
things
foretold
of
him
by
the
readers
of
planets
and
the
casters
of
nativities
in
shiraz
he
assisted
in
beguiling
himself
trusting
wilfully
to
the
two
witnesses
of
things
visible
as
is
declared
by
him
of
wise
sayings
there
is
in
every
a
hole
so
the
entangler
first
must
blind
the
soul
and
it
is
again
said
by
that
same
teacher
ye
that
the
inner
spirit
sight
would
seal
nought
credit
but
what
outward
orbs
reveal
and
the
soul
of
shibli
bagarag
was
blinded
by
rabesqurat
in
the
depths
of
the
enchanted
sea
she
sang
to
him
luting
deliriously
and
he
was
intoxicated
with
the
blissfulness
of
his
fortune
and
took
a
lute
and
sang
to
her
in
praise
of
her
rhyming
his
rapture
then
they
handed
the
goblet
to
each
other
and
drank
till
they
were
on
fire
with
the
joy
of
things
and
life
blushed
beauteousness
surely
rabesqurat
was
becoming
forgetful
of
her
arts
through
the
strength
of
those
draughts
till
her
eye
marked
the
lily
by
his
side
which
he
grasped
constantly
the
bright
flower
and
she
started
and
said
grant
o
my
king
my
husband
so
he
said
courteously
grants
are
granted
to
the
lovely
the
fascinating
and
their
grief
will
be
lack
of
aught
to
ask
for
then
said
she
my
husband
my
king
i
am
jealous
of
that
silly
flower
laugh
at
my
weakness
but
fling
it
from
thee
now
he
was
about
to
cast
it
from
him
when
a
vanity
possessed
his
mind
and
he
exclaimed
first
the
thing
i
will
do
a
wonder
she
cried
wonders
my
life
i
am
sated
with
them
and
he
said
am
oblivious
o
queen
of
how
i
came
by
this
flower
and
this
phial
but
thou
shalt
hear
a
thing
beyond
the
power
of
common
magic
and
see
that
i
am
something
now
she
plucked
at
him
to
abstain
from
his
action
but
he
held
the
phial
to
the
flower
she
signed
imperiously
to
some
slaves
to
stay
his
right
wrist
and
they
seized
on
it
but
not
all
of
them
together
could
withhold
him
from
dropping
a
drop
into
the
petals
of
the
flower
and
lo
the
lily
spake
a
voice
from
it
like
the
voice
of
noorna
saying
the
seventh
pillar
thereat
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
his
brows
and
frowned
back
memory
to
his
aid
and
the
scene
of
karaz
rabesqurat
abarak
and
his
betrothed
was
present
to
him
so
perceiving
that
the
queen
delayed
not
while
he
grasped
the
phial
to
take
in
her
hands
some
water
from
a
basin
near
and
flung
it
over
him
crying
and
while
his
mind
was
straining
to
bring
back
images
of
what
had
happened
he
fell
forward
once
more
at
the
feet
of
rabesqurat
senseless
as
a
stone
falls
such
was
the
force
of
her
enchantments
now
when
he
awoke
the
second
time
he
was
in
the
bosom
of
darkness
and
the
lily
gone
from
his
hand
so
he
lifted
the
phial
to
make
certain
of
that
and
groped
about
till
he
came
to
what
seemed
an
urn
to
the
touch
and
into
this
he
dropped
a
drop
and
asked
for
the
lily
and
a
voice
said
caught
a
light
from
it
in
passing
and
he
came
in
the
darkness
to
a
tree
and
a
bejewelled
bank
and
other
urns
and
swinging
lamps
without
light
and
a
running
water
and
a
grassy
bank
and
flowers
and
a
silver
seat
sprinkling
each
and
they
said
all
in
answer
to
his
question
of
the
lily
caught
a
light
from
it
in
passing
at
the
last
he
stumbled
upon
the
steps
of
a
palace
and
ascended
them
endowing
the
steps
with
speech
as
he
went
and
they
said
light
of
it
went
over
us
he
groped
at
the
porch
of
the
palace
and
gave
the
door
a
voice
and
it
opened
on
jasper
hinges
shrieking
light
of
it
went
through
me
then
he
entered
a
spacious
hall
scattering
drops
and
voices
exclaimed
glow
with
the
light
of
it
he
passed
groping
his
way
through
other
halls
and
dusk
chambers
scattering
drops
and
as
he
advanced
the
voices
increased
in
the
fervour
of
their
replies
saying
sequently
blush
with
the
light
of
it
we
beam
with
the
light
of
it
we
burn
with
the
light
of
it
so
presently
he
found
himself
in
a
long
low
room
sombrely
lit
roofed
with
crystals
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
lo
a
damsel
on
a
couch
of
purple
she
white
as
silver
spreading
radiance
of
such
lustrous
beauty
was
she
that
beside
her
the
princess
goorelka
as
shibli
bagarag
first
beheld
her
would
have
paled
like
a
morning
moon
even
noorna
had
waned
as
both
a
flower
in
fierce
heat
and
the
queen
of
enchantments
was
but
the
sun
behind
a
in
comparison
with
that
effulgent
damsel
on
the
length
of
the
purple
couch
well
for
him
he
wilt
of
the
magic
which
floated
through
that
palace
as
is
said
tempted
by
extremes
the
soul
is
most
secure
too
vivid
loveliness
blinds
with
its
beams
and
eyes
turned
inward
perceive
the
lure
pulling
down
his
turban
hastily
he
stepped
on
tiptoe
to
within
reach
of
her
and
looking
another
way
inclined
over
her
soft
vermeil
mouth
the
phial
slowly
till
it
brimmed
the
neck
and
dropped
a
drop
of
paravid
between
the
bow
of
those
sweet
lips
still
not
daring
to
gaze
on
her
he
said
then
question
is
of
the
lily
the
lily
of
the
sea
and
where
is
it
o
marvel
and
he
heard
a
voice
answer
in
the
tones
of
a
silver
bell
clear
as
a
wind
in
strung
wires
i
lie
lies
the
lily
the
lily
of
the
sea
i
with
it
it
with
me
said
he
breather
of
music
tell
me
how
i
may
lay
hand
on
the
flower
of
beauty
to
bear
it
forth
and
he
heard
the
voice
equal
space
betwixt
my
right
side
and
my
left
and
from
the
shoulder
one
span
and
half
a
span
downward
still
without
power
to
eye
her
he
measured
the
space
and
the
spans
his
hand
beneath
the
coverlids
of
the
couch
and
at
a
spot
of
the
bosom
his
hand
sank
in
and
he
felt
a
fluttering
thing
fluttering
like
a
frighted
bird
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
the
voice
said
seize
it
and
draw
it
out
and
tie
it
to
my
feet
by
the
twines
of
red
silk
about
it
he
seized
it
and
drew
it
out
and
it
was
a
heart
a
heart
of
streaming
with
crimson
palpitating
tears
flashed
on
his
sight
beholding
it
and
pity
took
the
seat
of
fear
and
he
turned
his
eyes
full
on
her
crying
sad
fair
thing
o
creature
of
anguish
o
painful
beauty
oh
what
have
i
done
to
thee
but
she
panted
and
gasped
short
and
shorter
gasps
pointing
with
one
finger
to
her
feet
then
he
took
the
warm
living
heart
while
it
yet
leapt
and
quivered
and
sobbed
and
he
held
it
with
a
trembling
hand
and
tied
it
by
the
red
twines
of
silk
about
it
to
her
feet
staining
their
whiteness
when
that
was
done
his
whole
soul
melted
with
pity
and
swelled
with
sorrow
and
ere
he
could
meet
her
eyes
a
swoon
overcame
him
surely
when
the
world
dawned
to
him
a
third
time
in
those
regions
the
damsel
was
no
longer
there
but
in
her
place
the
lily
of
light
he
thought
was
a
vision
that
damsel
a
terrible
one
one
to
terrify
and
bewilder
a
bitter
sweetness
oh
the
heart
the
heart
reflecting
on
the
heart
brought
to
his
lids
an
overcharging
of
tears
and
he
wept
violently
awhile
then
was
he
warned
by
the
thought
of
his
betrothed
to
take
the
lily
and
speed
with
it
from
the
realms
of
rabesqurat
and
he
stole
along
the
halls
of
the
palace
and
by
the
plashing
fountains
and
across
the
magic
courts
passing
chambers
of
sleepers
fair
dreamers
and
through
crowded
with
slaves
lo
as
he
held
the
lily
to
light
him
on
and
the
light
of
the
lily
fell
on
them
that
were
asleep
they
paled
and
shrank
and
were
such
as
the
maketh
of
us
so
he
called
upon
his
head
the
protection
of
allah
and
went
swifter
to
chase
from
his
limbs
the
shudder
of
awe
and
there
were
some
that
slept
not
but
stared
at
him
with
fixed
eyes
eyes
frozen
by
the
light
of
the
lily
and
he
shunned
those
for
they
were
like
spectres
haunting
spirits
after
he
had
coursed
the
length
of
the
palace
he
came
to
a
steep
place
outside
it
a
rock
with
steps
cut
in
stairs
and
up
these
he
went
till
he
came
to
a
small
door
in
the
rock
and
lying
by
it
a
bar
so
he
seized
the
bar
and
smote
the
door
and
the
door
shivered
for
on
his
right
wrist
were
the
hairs
of
garraveen
bending
his
body
he
slipped
through
the
opening
and
behold
an
orchard
dropping
blossoms
and
ripe
golden
fruits
streams
flowing
through
it
over
sands
and
brooks
bounding
above
glittering
gems
and
long
dewy
grasses
profusion
of
scented
flowers
shade
and
sweetness
so
he
let
himself
down
to
the
ground
which
was
an
easy
leap
from
the
aperture
and
walked
through
the
garden
holding
the
lily
behind
him
for
here
it
darkened
all
and
the
glowing
orchard
was
a
desert
by
its
light
presently
his
eye
fell
on
a
couch
swinging
between
two
almond
trees
and
advancing
to
it
he
beheld
the
queen
gathered
up
folded
temptingly
like
a
swaying
fruit
she
with
the
gold
circlet
on
her
head
and
she
was
fair
as
blossom
of
the
almond
in
a
breeze
of
the
wafted
sweetly
was
she
gathered
up
folded
temptingly
and
shibli
bagarag
refrained
from
using
the
lily
thinking
tis
like
the
great
things
foretold
of
me
this
having
of
queens
within
the
very
grasp
swinging
to
and
fro
as
if
to
taunt
backwardness
then
he
thought
tis
an
enchantress
i
will
yet
try
her
so
he
made
a
motion
of
flourishing
the
lily
once
or
twice
but
forbore
fascinated
for
she
had
on
her
fair
face
the
softness
of
sleep
her
lips
closed
in
dimples
and
the
wicked
fire
shut
from
beneath
her
lids
mastering
his
mind
the
youth
at
last
held
the
lily
to
her
and
saw
a
sight
to
blacken
the
world
and
all
bright
things
with
its
hideousness
scarce
had
he
time
to
thrust
the
lily
in
his
robes
when
the
queen
started
up
and
clapped
her
hands
crying
hurriedly
abarak
and
the
little
man
appeared
in
a
moment
at
the
door
by
which
shibli
bagarag
had
entered
the
orchard
so
she
cried
still
and
he
moved
toward
her
then
she
said
came
this
youth
here
prying
in
my
private
walks
my
bowers
speak
he
answered
the
aid
of
garraveen
only
o
queen
and
there
is
no
force
resisteth
the
bar
so
wielded
rabesqurat
looked
under
her
brows
at
shibli
bagarag
and
saw
the
horror
on
his
face
and
she
cried
out
to
abarak
in
an
agony
me
the
mirror
then
abarak
ran
and
returned
ere
the
queen
had
drawn
seven
impatient
breaths
and
in
one
hand
he
bore
a
sack
in
the
other
a
tray
so
he
emptied
the
contents
of
the
sack
on
the
surface
of
the
tray
surely
they
were
human
eyes
and
the
queen
flung
aside
her
tresses
and
stood
over
them
the
youth
saw
her
smile
at
them
and
assume
tender
and
taunting
manners
before
them
and
imperious
manners
killing
glances
till
in
each
of
the
eyes
there
was
a
sparkle
then
she
flung
back
her
head
as
one
that
feedeth
on
a
mighty
triumph
exclaiming
am
i
rabesqurat
wide
is
my
sovereignty
sideways
then
she
regarded
shibli
bagarag
and
it
seemed
she
was
urging
abarak
to
do
a
deed
beyond
his
powers
he
frowning
and
pointing
to
the
right
wrist
of
the
youth
so
she
clenched
her
hands
an
instant
with
that
feeling
which
knocketh
a
nail
in
the
coffin
of
a
desire
not
dead
and
controlled
herself
and
went
to
the
youth
breaking
into
beams
of
beauty
and
an
enchanting
sumptuousness
breathed
round
her
so
that
in
spite
of
himself
he
suffered
her
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
lead
him
from
that
orchard
through
the
shivered
door
and
into
the
palace
and
the
hall
of
the
jasper
pillars
strange
thrills
went
up
his
arm
from
the
touch
of
that
queen
and
they
were
as
little
snakes
twisting
and
darting
up
biting
of
irritating
blissfulness
now
the
hall
was
spread
for
a
feast
and
it
was
hung
with
lamps
of
silver
strewn
with
great
golden
goblets
and
viands
coloured
meats
and
ordered
fruits
on
shining
platters
then
said
she
to
shibli
bagarag
youth
there
shall
be
no
deceit
no
guile
between
us
thou
art
but
my
guest
i
no
bride
to
thee
so
take
the
place
of
the
guest
beside
me
he
took
his
seat
beside
her
abarak
standing
by
and
she
helped
the
youth
to
this
dish
and
that
dish
from
the
serving
of
slaves
caressing
him
with
flattering
looks
to
starve
aversion
and
nourish
tender
fellowship
and
he
was
like
one
that
slideth
down
a
hill
and
can
arrest
his
descent
with
a
foot
yet
faileth
that
freewill
when
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
with
her
the
queen
said
youth
no
other
than
my
guest
art
thou
not
a
prince
in
the
country
thou
comest
from
in
a
moment
the
pride
of
the
barber
forsook
him
and
he
equivocated
saying
queen
there
is
among
the
stars
somewhere
as
was
divined
by
the
readers
of
planets
a
crown
hanging
for
me
and
i
search
a
point
of
earth
to
intercept
its
fall
she
marked
him
beguiled
by
vanity
and
put
sweetmeats
to
his
mouth
exclaiming
manners
be
those
of
a
prince
then
she
sang
to
him
of
the
loneliness
of
her
life
and
of
one
with
whom
she
wished
to
share
her
state
such
as
he
and
at
her
signal
came
troops
of
damsels
that
stood
in
rings
and
luted
sweetly
on
the
same
theme
the
queen
loneliness
her
love
and
he
said
to
the
queen
this
so
she
answered
truly
so
now
he
thought
shall
at
least
speak
the
thing
that
is
if
she
look
it
not
so
he
took
the
goblet
and
contrived
to
drop
a
drop
from
the
phial
of
paravid
therein
without
her
observing
him
and
he
handed
her
the
goblet
she
him
and
they
drank
surely
the
change
that
came
over
the
queen
was
an
enchantment
and
her
eyes
shot
lustre
her
tongue
was
loosed
and
she
laughed
like
one
intoxicated
lolling
in
her
seat
lost
to
majesty
and
the
sway
of
her
magic
crying
abarak
abarak
little
man
long
my
slave
and
my
tool
ugly
little
man
and
o
shibli
bagarag
nephew
of
the
barber
weak
youth
small
prince
of
the
tackle
have
i
not
nigh
fascinated
thee
and
thou
wilt
forfeit
those
two
silly
eyes
of
thine
to
the
sack
and
o
abarak
abarak
little
man
have
i
flattered
thee
so
fetter
i
the
strong
with
my
allurements
and
i
stay
the
arrow
in
its
flight
and
i
blunt
the
barb
of
high
intents
wah
i
have
drunk
a
potent
stuff
i
talk
wullahy
i
know
there
is
a
danger
menacing
shagpat
and
the
eyes
of
all
genii
are
fixed
on
him
and
if
he
be
shaved
what
changes
will
follow
but
is
in
me
to
delude
the
barber
wullahy
and
i
will
avert
the
calamity
i
will
save
shagpat
while
the
queen
rabesqurat
prated
in
this
wise
with
flushed
face
shibli
bagarag
was
smitten
with
the
greatness
of
his
task
and
reproached
his
soul
with
neglect
of
it
and
he
thought
am
powerful
by
spells
as
none
before
me
have
been
and
was
by
my
weakness
the
queen
sought
to
tangle
me
i
will
clasp
the
seventh
pillar
and
make
an
end
of
it
by
allah
and
his
prophet
praised
be
the
name
and
i
will
reach
aklis
by
a
short
path
and
shave
shagpat
with
the
sword
so
he
looked
up
and
abarak
was
before
him
the
lifted
nostrils
of
the
little
man
wide
with
the
flame
of
anger
and
abarak
said
youth
regard
me
with
the
eyes
of
judgement
now
is
it
not
frightful
to
rate
me
little
an
instigation
of
the
evil
one
to
repute
me
ugly
the
promptings
of
wisdom
counselled
shibli
bagarag
to
say
beyond
contemplation
o
abarak
one
to
shame
our
species
surely
there
is
a
moon
between
thy
legs
a
pear
upon
thy
shoulders
and
the
cock
that
croweth
is
no
match
for
thee
in
measure
abarak
cried
be
aggrieved
we
two
o
youth
son
of
my
uncle
i
will
give
thee
means
of
vengeance
give
thou
me
means
shibli
bagarag
felt
scorn
at
the
queen
and
her
hollowness
and
he
said
well
take
this
lily
and
hold
it
to
her
now
the
queen
jeered
abarak
and
as
he
approached
her
she
shouted
thou
small
of
build
mite
of
creation
sour
mixture
thou
puppet
of
mine
thou
comest
thou
to
seek
a
second
kiss
against
the
compact
knowing
that
i
give
not
the
of
mortals
beyond
one
a
second
little
delayed
abarak
at
this
to
put
her
to
the
test
of
the
lily
and
he
held
the
flower
to
her
and
saw
the
sight
and
staggered
back
like
one
stricken
with
a
shaft
when
he
could
get
a
breath
he
uttered
such
a
howl
that
rabesqurat
in
her
drunkenness
was
fain
to
save
her
ears
and
the
hall
echoed
as
with
the
bellows
of
a
thousand
beasts
of
the
forest
then
to
glut
his
revenge
he
ran
for
the
sack
and
emptied
the
contents
of
it
the
queen
mirror
before
her
and
the
sackful
of
eyes
they
saw
the
sight
and
sickened
rolling
their
whites
that
done
abarak
gave
shibli
bagarag
the
bar
of
iron
and
bade
him
smite
the
pillars
all
save
the
seventh
and
he
smote
them
strengthily
crumbling
them
at
a
blow
and
bringing
down
the
great
hall
and
its
groves
and
glasses
and
gems
lamps
traceries
devices
a
heap
of
ruin
the
seventh
pillar
alone
standing
then
while
he
pumped
back
breath
into
his
body
abarak
said
no
delaying
in
this
place
now
o
youth
say
halt
thou
spells
for
the
entering
of
aklis
he
answered
then
said
abarak
well
surely
now
if
thou
takest
me
in
thy
service
i
help
thee
to
master
the
event
and
serve
thee
faithfully
requiring
nought
from
thee
save
a
sight
of
the
event
and
is
i
that
myself
missed
one
wiled
by
rabesqurat
quoth
shibli
bagarag
he
answered
word
of
it
now
agreed
so
shibli
bagarag
cried
so
thereupon
the
twain
entered
the
pillar
leaving
rabesqurat
prone
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
bounding
toward
her
where
she
lay
now
they
descended
and
ascended
flights
of
slippery
steps
and
sped
together
along
murky
passages
in
which
light
never
was
and
under
arches
of
caves
with
hanging
crystals
groping
and
tumbling
on
hurriedly
till
they
came
to
an
obstruction
and
felt
an
iron
door
frosty
to
the
touch
then
abarak
said
to
shibli
bagarag
and
the
youth
lifted
the
bar
to
his
right
shoulder
and
smote
and
the
door
obeyed
the
blow
and
discovered
an
opening
into
a
strange
dusky
land
as
it
seemed
a
valley
on
one
side
of
which
was
a
ragged
copper
sun
setting
low
large
as
a
battered
shield
giving
deep
red
lights
to
a
brook
that
fell
and
over
a
flat
stream
a
red
reflection
and
to
the
sides
of
the
hills
a
dark
red
glow
the
sky
was
a
brown
colour
the
earth
a
deeper
brown
like
the
skins
of
tawny
lions
trees
with
reddened
stems
stood
about
the
valley
scattered
and
in
groups
showing
between
their
leaves
the
cheeks
of
melancholy
fruits
swarthily
tinged
and
toward
the
centre
of
the
valley
a
shining
palace
was
visible
supported
by
massive
columns
of
marble
reddened
by
that
copper
sun
shibli
bagarag
was
awed
at
the
stillness
that
hung
everywhere
and
said
to
abarak
am
i
o
abarak
the
look
of
this
place
is
fearful
and
the
little
man
answered
but
beneath
the
mountains
in
aklis
wullahy
i
should
know
it
i
that
keep
the
passage
of
the
seventh
pillar
then
the
thought
of
his
betrothed
noorna
and
her
beauty
and
the
words
the
seventh
pillar
struck
the
heart
of
shibli
bagarag
and
he
exclaimed
passionately
she
in
safety
noorna
my
companion
my
betrothed
netted
by
thee
o
abarak
abarak
answered
sharply
not
of
betrothals
in
this
place
or
the
sword
of
aklis
will
move
without
a
hand
but
shibli
bagarag
waxed
the
colour
of
the
sun
that
was
over
them
and
cried
allah
i
will
smite
thee
with
the
bar
if
thou
swear
not
to
her
safety
and
point
not
out
to
me
where
she
now
is
then
said
abarak
wilt
make
a
better
use
of
the
bar
by
lifting
it
to
my
shoulder
and
poising
it
and
peering
through
it
shibli
bagarag
lifted
the
bar
to
the
shoulder
of
abarak
and
poised
it
and
peered
through
the
length
of
it
and
lo
there
was
a
sea
tossing
in
tumult
and
one
pillar
standing
erect
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
on
the
pillar
above
the
washing
waves
with
hair
blown
back
and
flapping
raiment
pale
but
smiling
still
noorna
his
betrothed
now
when
he
saw
her
he
made
a
rush
to
the
door
of
the
passage
but
abarak
blocked
the
way
crying
a
step
backward
in
aklis
is
death
and
when
he
had
wrestled
with
him
and
reined
him
abarak
said
to
reach
the
sword
from
the
sons
of
aklis
if
thou
wouldst
save
her
he
drew
him
to
the
brink
of
the
stream
and
whistled
a
parrot
whistle
and
shibli
bagarag
beheld
a
boat
draped
with
drooping
white
lotuses
that
floated
slowly
toward
them
and
when
it
was
near
he
and
abarak
entered
it
and
saw
one
a
veiled
figure
sitting
in
the
stern
who
neither
moved
to
them
nor
spake
but
steered
the
boat
to
a
certain
point
of
land
across
the
stream
where
stood
an
elephant
ready
girt
for
travellers
to
mount
him
and
the
elephant
kneeled
among
the
reeds
as
they
approached
that
they
might
mount
him
and
when
they
had
each
taken
a
seat
moved
off
waving
his
trunk
presently
the
elephant
came
to
a
halt
and
went
upon
his
knees
again
and
the
two
slid
off
his
back
and
were
among
black
slaves
that
bowed
to
the
ground
before
them
and
led
them
to
the
shining
gates
of
the
palace
in
silence
now
on
the
first
marble
step
of
the
palace
there
sat
an
old
man
dressed
like
a
dervish
who
held
out
at
arm
length
a
branch
of
gold
with
golden
between
its
leaves
saying
for
the
strongest
of
ye
abarak
exclaimed
am
that
one
and
he
held
forth
his
hand
for
the
branch
but
shibli
bagarag
cried
is
mine
wullahy
what
has
not
the
strength
of
this
hand
overthrown
then
the
brows
of
abarak
twisted
his
limbs
twitched
and
he
bawled
the
proof
waking
all
the
echoes
of
aklis
shibli
bagarag
was
tempted
in
his
desire
for
the
golden
branch
to
lift
the
iron
bar
upon
abarak
when
lo
the
phial
of
paravid
fell
from
his
vest
and
he
took
it
and
sprinkled
a
portion
of
the
waters
over
the
singing
birds
and
in
a
moment
they
burst
into
a
sweet
union
of
voices
singing
in
the
words
of
the
poet
when
for
one
serpent
were
two
asses
match
how
shall
one
foe
but
with
wiles
master
double
so
let
the
strong
keep
for
ever
good
watch
lest
their
strength
prove
a
snare
and
themselves
a
mere
bubble
for
vanity
maketh
the
strongest
most
weak
as
lions
and
men
totter
after
the
struggle
ye
heroes
be
modest
while
combats
ye
seek
the
cunning
one
trippeth
ye
both
with
a
juggle
now
at
this
verse
of
the
birds
shibli
bagarag
fixed
his
eye
on
the
old
man
and
the
beard
of
the
old
man
shrivelled
he
waxed
in
size
and
flew
up
in
a
blaze
and
with
a
baffled
shout
bearing
the
branch
surely
his
features
were
those
of
karaz
and
shibli
bagarag
knew
him
by
the
length
of
his
limbs
his
stiff
ears
and
copper
skin
then
he
laughed
a
loud
laugh
but
abarak
sobbed
saying
this
know
i
that
i
never
should
have
seized
the
sword
even
though
i
had
vanquished
the
illusions
of
rabesqurat
which
held
me
fast
so
shibli
bagarag
stared
at
him
and
said
thou
also
a
searcher
o
abarak
but
abarak
cried
not
the
talkative
tongue
of
the
past
o
youth
wullahy
relinquish
the
bar
that
is
my
bar
won
by
me
for
the
sword
is
within
thy
grip
and
they
await
thee
up
yonder
steps
go
go
and
look
for
me
here
on
thy
return
the
palace
of
aklis
now
shibli
bagarag
assured
himself
of
his
three
spells
and
made
his
heart
resolute
and
hastened
up
the
reddened
marble
steps
of
the
palace
and
when
he
was
on
the
topmost
step
lo
one
with
a
man
body
and
the
head
of
a
buffalo
that
prostrated
himself
and
prayed
the
youth
obsequiously
to
enter
the
palace
with
the
title
of
king
so
shibli
bagarag
held
his
head
erect
and
followed
him
with
the
footing
of
a
sultan
and
passed
into
a
great
hall
with
fountains
in
it
that
were
fountains
of
gems
pearls
chrysolites
jewels
and
by
the
margin
of
the
fountains
were
shapes
of
men
with
the
heads
of
wolves
foxes
lions
bears
oxen
sheep
serpents
asses
that
stretched
their
hands
to
the
falls
and
loaded
their
vestments
with
brilliants
loading
them
without
cessation
so
that
from
the
vestments
of
each
there
was
another
pouring
of
the
liquid
lights
then
he
with
the
head
bade
shibli
bagarag
help
himself
from
the
falls
but
shibli
bagarag
refused
for
his
soul
was
with
noorna
his
betrothed
and
he
saw
her
pale
on
that
solitary
pillar
in
the
tumult
of
the
sea
and
knew
her
safety
depended
on
his
faithfulness
he
cried
sword
of
aklis
nought
save
the
sword
now
at
these
words
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
other
heads
of
beasts
were
lifted
up
and
lo
they
put
their
hands
to
their
ears
and
tapped
their
foreheads
with
the
finger
of
reflection
as
creatures
seeking
to
bring
to
mind
a
serious
matter
then
the
fountains
rose
higher
and
flung
jets
of
radiant
jewels
and
a
drenching
spray
of
gems
upon
them
and
new
thirst
aroused
them
to
renew
their
gulping
of
the
falls
and
a
look
of
eagerness
was
even
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
the
silly
surely
shibli
bagarag
laughed
to
see
them
now
when
he
had
pressed
his
lips
to
recover
his
sight
from
the
dazzling
of
those
wondrous
fountains
he
heard
himself
again
addressed
by
the
title
of
king
and
there
was
before
him
a
lofty
cock
with
a
man
head
so
he
resumed
the
majesty
of
his
march
and
followed
the
cock
into
another
hall
spacious
and
clouded
with
heavy
scents
and
perfumes
burning
in
censers
and
urns
musk
myrrh
ambergris
and
livelier
odours
gladdening
the
nostril
like
wine
making
the
soul
reel
as
with
a
draught
of
the
forbidden
drink
here
before
a
feast
that
would
prick
the
dead
with
appetite
were
shapes
of
beasts
with
heads
of
men
asses
elephants
bulls
horses
swine
foxes
horses
dromedaries
and
they
ate
and
drank
as
do
the
famished
with
munch
and
gurgle
clacking
their
lips
joyfully
shibli
bagarag
remembered
the
condition
of
his
frame
when
first
he
looked
upon
the
city
of
shagpat
and
was
incited
to
eat
and
accede
to
the
invitation
of
the
cock
with
the
man
head
and
sit
among
these
merry
feeders
and
pickers
of
watering
morsels
when
with
the
city
of
shagpat
lo
he
had
a
vision
of
shagpat
hairier
than
at
their
interview
arrogant
in
hairiness
his
head
remote
in
contemptuous
waves
and
curls
and
frizzes
and
bushy
protuberances
of
hair
lost
in
it
like
an
idolatrous
temple
in
impenetrable
thickets
then
the
yearning
of
the
barber
seized
shibli
bagarag
and
desire
to
shear
shagpat
was
as
a
mighty
overwhelming
wave
in
his
bosom
and
he
shouted
sword
of
aklis
nought
save
the
sword
now
at
these
words
the
beasts
with
men
heads
wagged
their
tails
all
of
them
from
right
to
left
and
kept
their
jaws
from
motion
staring
stupidly
at
the
dishes
but
the
dishes
began
to
send
forth
stealthy
steams
insidious
whispers
to
the
nose
silver
intimations
of
savouriness
so
that
they
on
a
sudden
set
up
a
howl
and
shibli
bagarag
puckered
his
garments
from
them
as
from
devouring
dogs
and
hastened
from
that
hall
to
a
third
where
at
the
entrance
a
damsel
stood
that
smiled
to
him
and
led
him
into
a
vast
marbled
chamber
forty
cubits
high
hung
with
draperies
and
in
it
a
hundred
doors
and
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
very
of
young
beauties
such
as
the
blest
behold
in
paradise
robed
in
the
colours
of
the
rising
and
setting
sun
plump
with
long
black
languishing
eyes
and
undulating
figures
so
they
cried
to
him
greeting
o
our
king
now
he
counted
twenty
and
seven
of
them
and
fitting
his
gallantry
to
verse
answered
poor
are
the
heavens
that
have
not
ye
to
swell
their
glowing
plenty
up
there
but
one
bright
moon
i
see
here
mark
i
the
damsels
laughed
and
flung
back
their
locks
at
his
flattery
sporting
with
him
and
he
thought
be
sweet
maidens
i
will
know
if
they
be
illusions
like
rabesqurat
so
as
they
were
romping
he
slung
his
right
arm
round
one
and
held
the
lily
to
her
but
there
was
no
change
in
her
save
that
she
winked
somewhat
and
her
eyes
watered
and
it
was
so
with
the
others
for
when
they
saw
him
hold
the
lily
to
one
they
made
him
do
so
to
them
likewise
then
he
took
the
phial
and
touched
their
lips
with
the
waters
and
lo
they
commenced
luting
and
laughing
and
singing
verses
and
prattling
laughing
betweenwhiles
at
each
other
and
one
a
noisy
one
with
long
black
unquiet
tresses
and
a
curved
foot
and
roguish
ankle
sang
as
she
twirled
my
heart
is
another
i
can
not
be
tender
yet
if
thou
storm
it
i
fain
must
surrender
and
another
a
damsel
strong
upon
her
instep
and
stately
in
the
bearing
of
her
shoulders
sang
shrilly
i
of
the
mountains
and
he
that
comes
to
me
like
eagle
must
win
and
like
hurricane
woo
me
and
another
reclining
on
a
couch
buried
in
dusky
silks
like
a
butterfly
under
the
leaves
a
soft
ball
of
beauty
sang
moaningly
here
like
a
fruit
on
the
branch
am
i
swaying
snatch
ere
i
fall
love
there
death
in
delaying
and
another
light
as
an
antelope
on
the
hills
with
antelope
eyes
edged
with
kohl
and
timid
graceful
movements
and
small
white
rounded
ears
sang
clearly
swiftness
is
mine
and
i
fly
from
the
sordid
follow
me
follow
and
you
be
rewarded
and
another
with
large
limbs
and
massive
mould
that
stepped
like
a
cow
leisurely
cropping
the
pasture
and
shook
with
jewels
amid
her
black
hair
and
above
her
brown
eyes
and
round
her
white
neck
and
her
wrists
and
on
her
waist
even
to
her
ankle
sang
as
with
a
kiss
upon
every
word
sweet
is
in
stillness
and
bliss
to
be
basking
he
who
would
have
me
may
have
for
the
asking
and
another
with
eyebrows
like
a
bow
and
arrows
of
fire
in
her
eyes
and
two
rosebuds
her
full
moist
parted
pouting
lips
sang
clasping
her
hands
and
voiced
like
the
tremulous
passionate
bulbul
in
the
shadows
of
the
moon
love
is
my
life
and
with
love
i
live
only
give
me
life
lover
and
leave
me
not
lonely
and
a
seventh
a
very
beam
of
beauty
and
the
perfection
of
all
that
is
imagined
in
fairness
and
ample
grace
of
expression
and
proportion
lo
she
came
straight
to
shibli
bagarag
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
pierced
him
with
lightning
glances
singing
were
we
not
destined
to
meet
by
one
planet
can
a
fate
sever
us
can
it
ah
can
it
and
she
sang
tender
songs
to
him
mazing
him
with
blandishments
so
that
the
aim
of
existence
and
the
summit
of
ambition
now
seemed
to
him
the
life
of
a
king
in
that
palace
among
the
damsels
and
he
thought
these
be
no
illusions
and
they
speak
the
thing
that
is
in
them
wullahy
loveliness
is
their
portion
they
call
me
king
then
she
that
had
sung
to
him
said
we
have
been
waiting
thee
long
to
crown
thee
our
king
thou
hast
been
in
some
way
delayed
o
glorious
one
and
he
answered
fair
ones
transcending
in
affability
i
have
stumbled
upon
obstructions
in
my
journey
hither
and
i
have
met
with
adventures
but
of
this
crowning
that
was
to
follow
them
i
knew
nought
wullahy
thrice
have
i
been
saluted
king
i
whom
fate
selecteth
for
the
shaving
of
shagpat
and
till
now
it
was
a
beguilement
all
emptiness
they
marked
his
bewildered
state
and
some
knelt
before
him
some
held
their
arms
out
adoringly
some
leaned
to
him
with
glistening
looks
and
he
was
fast
falling
a
slave
to
their
flatteries
succumbing
to
them
imagination
fired
him
with
the
splendours
due
to
one
that
was
a
king
and
the
thought
of
wearing
a
crown
again
took
possession
of
his
soul
and
he
cried
me
o
my
handmaidens
and
delay
not
to
crown
me
for
as
the
poet
says
the
king
without
his
crown
hath
a
forehead
like
the
clown
and
the
circle
of
my
head
itcheth
for
the
symbols
of
majesty
at
these
words
of
shibli
bagarag
they
arose
quickly
and
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
with
the
nimble
step
of
gladness
exclaiming
our
king
pleasant
will
be
the
time
with
him
and
one
smoothed
his
head
and
poured
oil
upon
it
one
brought
him
garments
of
gold
and
silk
inwoven
one
fetched
him
slippers
like
the
sun
beam
in
brightness
others
stood
together
in
clusters
and
with
lutes
and
singing
odes
to
him
and
lo
one
took
a
needle
and
threaded
it
and
gave
the
thread
into
the
hands
of
shibli
bagarag
and
with
the
point
of
the
needle
she
pricked
certain
letters
on
his
right
wrist
and
afterwards
pricked
the
same
letters
on
a
door
in
the
wall
then
she
said
to
him
it
in
thy
power
to
make
those
letters
speak
he
answered
will
prove
how
that
may
be
so
he
flung
some
drops
from
the
phial
over
the
letters
and
they
glowed
the
colour
of
blood
and
flashed
with
a
report
and
it
was
as
if
a
fiery
had
darted
before
them
and
spake
the
words
written
and
they
were
is
the
crown
of
him
who
bath
achieved
his
aim
and
resteth
here
thereupon
she
stuck
the
needle
in
the
door
and
he
pulled
the
thread
and
the
door
drew
apart
and
lo
a
small
chamber
and
on
a
raised
cushion
of
blue
satin
a
glittering
crown
thick
with
jewels
as
a
frost
such
as
ambition
pineth
to
wear
and
the
knees
of
men
weaken
and
bend
beholding
and
it
lanced
lights
about
it
like
a
living
sun
beside
the
cushion
was
a
vacant
throne
radiant
as
morning
in
the
east
ablaze
with
devices
in
gold
and
gems
a
seat
to
fill
the
meanest
soul
with
sensations
of
majesty
and
tempt
dervishes
to
the
sitting
posture
shibli
bagarag
was
intoxicated
at
the
sight
and
he
thought
but
if
i
sit
on
this
throne
and
am
a
king
with
that
crown
i
can
command
men
and
things
and
i
have
but
to
say
fetch
noorna
my
betrothed
from
yonder
pillar
in
the
midst
of
the
uproarious
sea
let
the
hairy
shagpat
be
shaved
and
behold
slaves
thousands
of
them
do
my
bidding
wullahy
this
is
greatness
now
he
made
a
rush
to
the
throne
but
the
damsels
held
him
back
crying
for
thy
life
till
we
have
crowned
thee
our
master
and
lord
then
they
took
the
crown
and
crowned
him
with
it
and
he
sat
upon
the
throne
calmly
serenely
like
a
sultan
of
the
great
race
accustomed
to
sovereignty
tempering
the
awfulness
of
his
brows
with
benignant
glances
so
while
he
sat
the
damsels
hid
their
faces
and
started
some
paces
from
him
as
unable
to
bear
the
splendour
of
his
presence
and
in
a
moment
lo
the
door
closed
between
him
and
them
and
he
was
in
darkness
then
he
heard
a
voice
of
the
damsels
cry
in
the
hall
ninety
and
ninth
peace
now
for
us
and
blissfulness
with
our
lords
for
now
all
are
filled
save
the
door
of
the
sword
which
maketh
the
hundredth
after
that
he
heard
the
same
voice
say
them
o
my
sisters
so
he
listened
to
the
noise
of
their
departing
and
knew
he
had
been
duped
surely
his
soul
cursed
him
as
he
sat
crowned
and
throned
in
that
darkness
he
seized
the
crown
to
dash
it
to
the
earth
but
the
crown
was
fixed
on
his
forehead
and
would
not
come
off
neither
had
he
force
to
rise
from
the
throne
now
the
thought
of
noorna
his
betrothed
where
she
rested
waiting
for
him
to
deliver
her
filled
shibli
bagarag
with
the
extremes
of
anguish
and
he
lifted
his
right
arm
and
dashed
it
above
his
head
in
the
violence
of
his
grief
striking
in
the
motion
a
hidden
gong
that
gave
forth
a
burst
of
thunder
and
a
roll
of
bellowings
and
lo
the
door
opened
before
him
and
the
throne
as
he
sat
on
it
moved
out
of
the
chamber
into
the
hall
where
he
had
seen
the
damsels
that
duped
him
and
on
every
side
of
the
hall
doors
opened
and
he
marvelled
to
see
men
old
and
young
beardless
and
venerable
sitting
upon
thrones
and
crowned
with
crowns
motionless
with
eyes
like
stones
in
the
recesses
he
thought
be
other
dupes
wallaby
a
drop
of
the
waters
of
paravid
upon
their
lips
might
reveal
mysteries
and
guide
me
to
the
sword
of
my
seeking
so
as
he
considered
how
to
get
at
them
from
the
seat
of
his
throne
his
gaze
fell
on
a
mirror
and
he
beheld
the
crown
on
his
forehead
what
it
was
bejewelled
asses
ears
stiffened
upright
and
skulls
of
monkeys
grinning
with
gems
the
sight
of
that
crowning
his
head
convulsed
shibli
bagarag
with
laughter
and
as
he
laughed
his
seat
upon
the
throne
was
loosened
and
he
pitched
from
it
but
the
crown
stuck
to
him
and
was
tenacious
of
its
hold
as
the
lion
that
pounceth
upon
a
victim
he
bowed
to
the
burden
of
necessity
and
took
the
phial
and
touched
the
lips
of
one
that
sat
crowned
on
a
throne
with
the
waters
in
the
phial
and
it
was
a
man
of
exceeding
age
whitened
with
time
and
in
the
long
sweep
of
his
beard
like
a
mountain
clad
with
snow
from
the
peak
that
is
in
the
sky
to
the
base
that
slopeth
to
the
valley
then
he
addressed
the
old
man
on
his
throne
saying
me
o
king
how
camest
thou
here
and
in
search
of
what
the
old
man
lips
moved
and
he
muttered
in
deep
tones
cometh
he
of
the
door
so
shibli
bagarag
cried
he
is
before
thee
in
aklis
and
the
old
man
said
him
ask
no
secrets
but
when
he
hath
reached
the
sword
forget
not
to
flash
it
in
this
hall
for
the
sake
of
brotherhood
in
adventure
after
that
he
would
answer
no
word
to
any
questioning
the
sons
of
aklis
now
shibli
bagarag
thought
poet
is
right
in
aklis
as
elsewhere
in
his
words
the
cunning
of
our
wit
doth
best
the
keyhole
of
occasion
fit
and
whoso
looketh
for
help
from
others
looketh
the
wrong
way
in
an
undertaking
wah
i
will
be
bold
and
batter
at
the
hundredth
door
which
is
the
door
of
the
sword
so
he
advanced
straightway
to
the
door
which
was
one
of
solid
silver
charactered
with
silver
letters
and
knocked
against
it
three
knocks
and
a
voice
within
said
spells
he
answered
garraveen
and
the
lily
of
the
sea
upon
that
the
voice
said
by
virtue
of
the
spells
and
the
silver
door
swung
open
discovering
a
deep
pit
lightened
by
a
torch
and
across
it
bridging
it
a
string
of
enormous
eggs
rocs
eggs
hollowed
and
so
large
that
a
man
might
walk
through
them
without
stooping
at
the
side
of
each
egg
three
lamps
were
suspended
from
a
claw
and
the
shell
passage
was
illumined
with
them
from
end
to
end
shibli
bagarag
thought
eggs
are
of
a
surety
the
eggs
of
the
roc
mastered
by
aklis
with
his
sword
now
as
the
sight
of
shibli
bagarag
grew
familiar
to
the
place
he
beheld
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
a
fluttering
mass
of
blackness
and
two
sickly
eyes
that
glittered
below
then
thought
he
if
that
be
the
roc
and
it
not
dead
will
the
bird
suffer
one
to
defile
its
eggs
with
other
than
the
sole
of
the
foot
naked
he
undid
his
sandals
and
kicked
off
the
slippers
given
him
by
the
damsels
that
had
duped
him
and
went
into
the
first
egg
over
the
abyss
and
into
the
second
and
into
the
third
and
into
the
fourth
and
into
the
fifth
surely
the
eggs
swung
with
him
and
bent
and
the
fear
of
their
breaking
and
he
falling
into
the
maw
of
the
terrible
bird
made
him
walk
unevenly
when
he
had
come
to
the
seventh
egg
which
was
the
last
it
shook
and
swung
violently
and
he
heard
underneath
the
flapping
of
the
wings
of
the
roc
as
with
eagerness
expecting
a
victim
to
prey
upon
he
sustained
his
soul
with
the
firmness
of
resolve
and
darted
himself
lengthwise
to
the
landing
clutching
a
hold
with
his
right
hand
as
he
did
so
the
bridge
of
eggs
broke
and
he
heard
the
feathers
of
the
bird
in
agitation
and
the
bird
screaming
a
scream
of
disappointment
as
he
scrambled
up
the
sides
of
the
pit
now
shibli
bagarag
failed
not
to
perform
two
prostrations
to
allah
and
raised
the
song
of
gratitude
for
his
preservation
when
he
found
himself
in
safety
then
he
looked
up
and
lo
behind
a
curtain
steps
leading
to
an
anteroom
and
beyond
that
a
chamber
like
the
chamber
of
kings
where
they
sit
in
state
dispensing
judgements
like
the
sun
at
noon
in
splendour
and
in
the
chamber
seven
youths
tall
and
comely
young
men
calm
as
princes
in
their
port
each
one
dressed
in
flowing
robes
and
with
a
large
glowing
pearl
in
the
front
of
their
turbans
they
advanced
to
meet
him
saying
to
aklis
thou
that
art
proved
worthy
is
holiday
now
with
us
and
they
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
with
them
in
silence
past
and
porphyry
pillars
to
where
a
service
with
refreshments
was
spread
meats
fowls
with
rice
sweetmeats
preserves
palateable
mixtures
and
monuments
of
the
cook
art
goblets
of
wine
like
liquid
rubies
then
one
of
the
youths
said
to
shibli
bagarag
hast
come
to
us
crowned
o
our
guest
now
it
is
not
our
custom
to
pay
homage
but
thou
shalt
presently
behold
them
that
will
so
let
not
thy
kingliness
droop
with
us
but
feast
royally
and
shibli
bagarag
said
my
princes
surely
it
is
a
silly
matter
to
crown
a
mouse
humility
hath
depressed
my
stature
wullahy
i
have
had
warning
in
the
sticking
of
this
crown
to
my
brows
and
it
sticketh
like
an
abomination
they
laughed
at
him
saying
was
the
heaviness
of
that
crown
which
overweighted
thee
in
the
bridge
of
the
abyss
and
few
be
they
that
bear
it
and
go
not
to
feed
the
roc
now
they
feasted
together
interchanging
civilities
offering
to
each
other
choice
morsels
dainties
and
the
anecdotes
of
shibli
bagarag
his
simplicity
and
his
honesty
and
his
vanity
and
his
airiness
and
the
betraying
tongue
of
the
barber
diverted
the
youths
and
they
plied
him
with
old
wine
till
his
stores
of
merriment
broke
forth
and
were
as
a
river
swollen
by
torrents
of
the
mountain
and
the
seven
youths
laughed
at
him
spluttering
with
laughter
lurching
with
it
surely
he
described
to
them
the
loquacity
of
baba
mustapha
his
uncle
and
they
laughed
so
that
their
chins
were
uppermost
but
at
his
mention
of
shagpat
greater
gravity
was
theirs
and
they
smoothed
their
faces
solemnly
and
the
sun
of
their
merriment
was
darkened
for
awhile
then
they
took
to
flinging
about
pellets
of
a
sugared
preparation
and
reciting
verses
in
praise
of
jovial
living
challenging
to
drink
this
one
and
that
one
passing
the
cup
with
a
stanza
shibli
bagarag
thought
a
life
is
this
led
by
these
youths
a
fair
one
is
they
that
be
the
sons
of
aklis
who
sharpen
the
sword
of
events
yet
live
they
in
jollity
skimming
from
the
profusion
of
abundance
that
which
floateth
now
marking
him
contemplative
one
of
the
youths
shouted
king
lacketh
homage
and
another
called
for
his
people
then
the
seven
arose
and
placed
shibli
bagarag
on
an
elevation
in
the
midst
of
them
and
lo
a
troop
of
black
slaves
leading
by
the
collar
asses
and
by
a
string
monkeys
now
for
the
asses
they
brayed
to
the
evil
one
and
the
monkeys
were
prankish
pulling
against
the
string
till
they
caught
sight
of
shibli
bagarag
then
was
it
as
if
they
had
been
awestricken
and
they
came
forward
to
him
with
docile
steps
eyeing
the
crown
on
his
head
and
prostrated
themselves
the
asses
and
the
monkeys
like
creatures
in
whom
glowed
the
lamp
of
reason
and
the
gift
of
intelligence
so
shibli
bagarag
drooped
his
jaw
and
was
ashamed
and
he
cried
princes
am
i
a
king
of
these
they
answered
king
in
mightiness
sultan
of
a
race
so
he
said
is
certain
i
shall
need
physic
to
support
such
a
sovereignty
and
i
must
be
excused
liberal
allowances
of
old
wine
to
sit
in
state
among
them
wullahy
they
were
best
gone
for
awhile
send
them
from
me
o
my
princes
i
sicken
and
he
called
to
the
animals
begone
frowning
then
said
the
youths
commanded
and
like
a
king
see
they
troop
from
thy
presence
obediently
now
the
animals
fled
from
before
the
brows
of
shibli
bagarag
and
when
the
chamber
was
empty
of
them
the
seven
young
men
said
a
surety
thou
wert
flattered
to
observe
the
aspect
of
these
animals
at
beholding
thee
but
he
cried
so
o
my
princes
there
is
nought
flattering
in
the
homage
of
asses
and
monkeys
then
they
said
sultan
of
asses
ruler
of
monkeys
better
that
than
thyself
an
ass
and
an
ape
as
was
said
by
shah
kasirwan
i
prefer
being
king
of
beasts
worshipped
by
beasts
rather
than
a
crowned
beast
worshipped
by
men
and
it
was
well
said
wullahy
the
kings
of
roum
quote
it
now
shibli
bagarag
was
not
rendered
oblivious
of
the
sword
of
his
quest
by
the
humour
of
these
youths
or
the
and
he
exclaimed
while
they
were
turning
up
the
heels
of
their
cups
ye
sons
of
aklis
know
that
i
have
come
hither
for
the
sword
sharpened
by
your
hands
for
the
releasing
of
my
betrothed
noorna
bin
noorka
daughter
of
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
for
the
shaving
of
shagpat
while
he
was
proceeding
to
recount
the
story
of
his
search
for
the
sword
they
said
o
potentate
of
the
braying
class
and
of
the
scratching
tribe
we
have
seen
thee
through
the
eye
of
aklis
since
the
time
of
thy
first
thwacking
what
says
the
poet
a
day
for
toil
and
a
day
for
rest
gives
labour
zeal
and
pleasure
zest
so
of
thy
seeking
let
us
hear
but
now
drink
with
us
and
make
merry
and
touch
the
springs
of
memory
spout
forth
verses
quaint
ones
suitable
to
the
hour
and
the
entertainment
wullahy
drink
with
us
taste
life
let
the
humours
flow
then
they
made
a
motion
to
some
slaves
and
presently
a
clattering
of
anklets
struck
the
ear
of
shibli
bagarag
and
he
beheld
moons
of
beauty
and
elegance
and
they
danced
wild
dances
and
dances
graceful
and
and
in
movement
and
the
youths
flung
flowers
at
them
applauding
them
then
came
other
sets
of
dancers
even
lovelier
more
languishing
and
again
others
with
tambourines
and
musical
instruments
that
sang
ravishingly
so
the
senses
of
shibli
bagarag
were
all
taken
with
what
he
saw
and
heard
and
ate
and
drank
and
by
degrees
a
mist
came
before
his
eyes
and
the
sweet
sounds
and
voices
of
the
girls
grew
distant
and
it
was
with
difficulty
he
kept
his
back
from
the
length
of
the
cushions
that
were
about
him
then
he
thought
of
noorna
and
that
she
sang
to
him
and
danced
and
when
he
rose
to
embrace
her
she
was
rabesqurat
by
the
light
of
the
lily
and
he
thought
of
shagpat
and
that
in
shaving
him
the
blade
was
checked
in
its
rapid
sweep
and
blunted
by
a
stumpy
twine
of
hair
that
waxed
in
size
and
became
the
head
of
karaz
that
gulped
at
him
a
wide
devouring
gulp
and
took
him
in
and
flew
up
with
him
leaving
shagpat
half
sheared
then
he
thought
himself
struggling
halfway
down
the
throat
of
the
monstrous
roc
and
that
when
he
was
wholly
inside
the
roc
he
was
in
a
passage
crowded
with
lamps
and
at
the
end
of
the
passage
noorna
in
the
clutch
of
karaz
she
shouting
sword
the
sword
now
while
he
felt
for
the
sword
wherewith
to
release
her
from
the
genie
his
eyes
opened
and
he
saw
day
through
a
casement
and
that
he
had
reposed
on
an
embroidered
couch
in
the
corner
of
a
stately
room
ornamented
with
carvings
of
blue
and
gold
so
while
he
wondered
and
yawned
gaping
slaves
started
up
from
the
floor
and
led
him
to
a
bath
of
coloured
marble
and
bathed
him
in
perfumed
waters
and
dressed
him
in
a
dress
of
yellow
silk
rich
and
ample
then
they
paraded
before
him
through
lesser
apartments
and
across
terraces
till
they
came
to
a
great
hall
loftier
and
more
spacious
than
any
he
had
yet
beheld
with
fountains
at
the
two
ends
and
in
the
centre
a
tree
with
golden
spreading
branches
and
leaves
of
gold
among
the
leaves
birds
and
fruits
of
all
seasons
and
every
description
the
drooping
grape
and
the
quince
and
the
pomegranate
and
the
apricot
and
the
green
and
rosy
apple
and
the
gummy
date
and
the
oily
nut
and
peaches
and
citrons
and
oranges
and
the
plum
and
the
fig
surely
they
were
countless
in
number
melting
with
ripeness
soft
full
to
bursting
and
the
birds
darted
among
them
like
now
shibli
bagarag
thought
is
a
wondrous
tree
wullahy
there
is
nought
like
it
save
the
tree
in
the
hall
of
the
prophet
in
paradise
feeding
the
faithful
as
he
regarded
it
he
heard
his
name
spoken
in
the
hall
and
turning
he
beheld
seven
youths
in
royal
garments
that
were
like
the
youths
he
had
feasted
with
and
yet
unlike
them
pale
and
stern
in
their
manners
their
courtesy
as
the
courtesy
of
kings
they
said
with
us
and
eat
the
morning
meal
o
our
guest
so
he
sat
with
them
under
the
low
branches
of
the
tree
and
they
whistled
the
tune
of
one
bird
and
of
another
bird
and
of
another
and
lo
those
different
birds
flew
down
with
golden
baskets
hanging
from
their
bills
and
in
the
baskets
fruits
and
viands
and
sweetmeats
and
cool
drinks
and
shibli
bagarag
ate
from
the
baskets
of
the
birds
watching
the
action
of
the
seven
youths
and
the
difference
that
was
in
them
he
sought
to
make
them
recognise
him
and
acknowledge
their
carouse
of
the
evening
that
was
past
but
they
stared
at
him
strangely
and
seemed
offended
at
the
allusion
neither
would
they
hear
mention
of
the
sword
of
his
seeking
presently
one
of
the
youths
stood
upon
his
feet
and
cried
the
time
for
kings
to
sit
in
judgement
and
the
youths
arose
and
led
shibli
bagarag
to
a
hall
of
ebony
and
seated
him
on
the
upper
seat
themselves
standing
about
him
and
lo
asses
and
monkeys
came
before
him
complaining
of
the
injustice
of
men
and
their
fellows
in
brays
and
bellows
and
hoots
now
at
the
sight
of
them
again
shibli
bagarag
was
enraged
and
he
said
to
the
youths
do
ye
not
mock
me
o
masters
of
aklis
but
they
said
only
burden
of
his
crown
is
for
the
king
he
cooled
thinking
will
use
a
spell
so
he
touched
the
lips
of
an
animal
with
the
waters
of
paravid
and
the
animal
prated
volubly
in
our
language
of
the
kick
this
ass
had
given
him
and
the
jibe
of
that
monkey
and
of
his
desire
of
litigation
with
such
and
such
a
beast
for
pasture
and
the
others
when
they
spake
had
the
same
complaints
to
make
shibli
bagarag
listened
to
them
gravely
and
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
he
who
ruleth
over
men
hath
a
labour
and
duties
of
hearing
and
judging
and
dispensing
judgement
similar
to
those
of
him
who
ruleth
over
apes
and
asses
then
said
he
youths
my
princes
methinks
the
sitting
in
this
seat
giveth
a
key
to
secret
sources
of
wisdom
and
i
see
what
it
is
the
glory
and
the
exaltation
coveted
by
men
now
he
took
from
the
asses
and
the
monkeys
one
and
said
to
it
my
chief
vizier
and
to
another
my
chamberlain
and
to
another
my
treasurer
and
so
on
till
a
dispute
arose
between
the
animals
and
jealousy
of
each
other
was
visible
in
their
glances
and
they
appealed
to
him
clamorously
so
he
said
am
i
to
ye
they
answered
king
and
he
said
so
they
answered
the
crowning
of
the
brides
of
aklis
then
he
said
be
ye
o
my
subjects
they
answered
that
were
searchers
of
the
sword
and
plunged
into
the
tank
of
temptation
and
he
said
that
they
answered
the
lures
of
vanity
the
blinding
of
ambition
and
tasting
the
gall
of
the
roc
so
shibli
bagarag
leaned
to
the
seven
youths
saying
my
princes
but
for
not
tasting
the
gall
of
the
roc
i
might
be
as
one
of
these
wullahy
i
the
king
am
warned
by
base
creatures
then
he
said
to
the
animals
ye
still
a
longing
for
the
crown
and
they
cried
all
of
them
light
of
the
astonished
earth
we
care
for
nought
other
than
it
so
he
said
is
it
known
to
ye
how
to
dispossess
the
wearer
of
his
burden
they
answered
a
touch
of
the
gall
of
the
roc
on
his
forehead
then
he
lifted
his
arms
crying
out
of
my
presence
and
whoso
of
ye
fetcheth
a
drop
of
the
gall
with
that
one
will
i
exchange
the
crown
at
these
words
some
moved
hastily
but
the
most
faltered
as
doubting
and
incredulous
that
he
would
propose
such
an
exchange
and
one
an
old
monkey
sat
down
and
crossed
his
legs
and
made
a
study
of
shibli
bagarag
as
of
a
sovereign
that
held
forth
a
deceiving
bargain
but
he
cried
again
and
haste
as
my
head
is
now
cased
i
think
it
not
the
honoured
part
then
the
old
monkey
arose
with
a
puzzled
look
half
scornful
and
made
for
the
door
slowly
turning
his
head
toward
shibli
bagarag
betweenwhiles
as
he
went
and
scratching
his
lower
limbs
with
the
mute
reflectiveness
of
age
and
extreme
caution
now
when
they
were
gone
shibli
bagarag
looked
in
the
eyes
of
the
seven
youths
and
saw
they
were
content
with
him
and
his
countenance
was
brightened
with
approval
so
he
descended
from
his
seat
and
went
with
them
from
the
hall
of
ebony
to
a
court
where
horses
were
waiting
saddled
and
slaves
with
hawks
on
their
wrists
stood
in
readiness
and
they
mounted
each
a
horse
but
he
loitered
the
seven
youths
divined
his
feeling
and
cried
impatiently
no
lingering
in
aklis
so
he
mounted
likewise
and
they
emerged
from
the
palace
and
entered
the
hills
that
glowed
under
the
copper
sun
and
started
a
antelope
with
ruby
spots
and
chased
it
from
its
cover
over
the
a
hawk
being
let
loose
to
worry
it
and
distress
its
timid
beaming
eyes
when
the
creature
was
quite
overcome
one
of
the
youths
struck
his
heel
into
his
horse
side
and
flung
a
noose
over
the
head
of
the
quarry
and
drew
it
with
them
gently
petting
it
the
way
home
to
the
palace
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
it
was
released
and
lo
it
went
up
the
steps
and
passed
through
the
halls
as
one
familiar
with
them
now
when
they
were
all
assembled
in
the
anteroom
of
the
hall
where
shibli
bagarag
had
first
seen
the
seven
youths
sons
of
aklis
in
their
jollity
one
of
them
said
to
the
antelope
have
need
of
thee
to
speak
a
word
with
aklis
o
our
sister
so
the
same
youth
requested
the
use
of
the
phial
of
paravid
and
shibli
bagarag
applied
it
carefully
tenderly
to
the
mouth
of
the
antelope
then
the
antelope
spake
in
a
voice
saying
is
it
o
my
brothers
they
answered
knowest
we
dare
not
attempt
interchange
of
speech
with
aklis
seeing
that
we
disobeyed
him
in
visiting
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
so
it
is
for
thee
to
question
him
as
to
the
object
of
this
youth
and
it
is
the
shaving
of
shagpat
so
she
said
well
i
wot
of
it
then
she
advanced
to
the
curtain
concealing
the
abyss
of
the
roc
and
the
bridge
of
its
eggs
and
went
behind
it
there
was
a
pause
and
they
heard
her
say
presently
in
a
grave
voice
toned
with
reverence
is
it
o
our
father
is
it
a
good
thing
that
thy
sword
be
in
use
at
this
season
and
they
heard
the
voice
answer
from
a
depth
well
it
rust
not
they
heard
her
say
our
father
aklis
and
we
wish
to
know
if
be
held
in
favour
by
thee
and
thou
sanction
it
with
thy
sword
and
they
heard
the
voice
answer
shaving
of
shagpat
is
my
sword
alone
equal
to
and
he
that
shaveth
him
performeth
a
service
to
mankind
ranking
next
my
vanquishing
of
the
roc
then
they
heard
her
say
it
is
thy
will
we
teach
him
the
mysteries
of
the
sword
and
that
which
may
be
done
with
it
and
they
heard
the
voice
answer
so
after
that
the
voice
was
still
and
soon
the
antelope
returned
from
behind
the
curtain
and
the
youths
caressed
her
with
brotherly
caresses
and
took
a
circle
of
hands
about
her
and
so
moved
to
the
great
hall
of
the
gorgeous
tree
and
fed
her
from
the
branches
now
while
they
were
there
shibli
bagarag
advanced
to
the
antelope
and
knelt
at
her
feet
and
said
princess
of
aklis
surely
i
am
betrothed
to
one
constant
as
a
fixed
star
and
brighter
a
mistress
of
magic
and
innocent
as
the
bleating
lamb
and
she
is
now
on
a
pillar
chained
there
in
the
midst
of
the
white
wrathful
sea
wailing
for
me
to
deliver
her
with
this
sword
of
my
seeking
so
now
i
pray
thee
help
me
to
the
sword
swiftly
that
i
may
deliver
her
the
youths
her
brothers
clamoured
and
interposed
saying
thy
shape
ere
that
o
gulrevaz
our
sister
but
she
cried
is
betrothed
not
till
he
graspeth
the
sword
tell
him
the
youth
our
conditions
and
for
what
exchange
the
sword
is
yielded
and
they
said
conditions
are
thou
part
with
thy
spells
all
of
them
o
youth
and
he
said
is
no
condition
harsh
that
exchangeth
the
sword
o
ye
seven
i
agree
then
she
said
well
nobility
is
in
the
soul
of
this
youth
go
before
us
now
to
the
cave
of
chrysolites
o
my
brothers
so
these
departed
before
and
she
in
her
antelope
form
followed
footing
gracefully
and
made
shibli
bagarag
repeat
the
story
of
his
betrothal
as
they
went
the
sword
of
aklis
now
when
they
had
made
the
passage
of
many
halls
built
of
different
woods
filled
with
divers
wonders
they
descended
a
sloping
vault
and
came
to
a
narrow
way
in
the
earth
hung
with
black
at
the
end
of
it
a
stedfast
blaze
like
a
sun
that
grew
larger
as
they
advanced
and
they
heard
the
sea
above
them
the
noise
of
it
and
its
plunging
and
weltering
and
its
pitilessness
struck
on
the
heart
of
shibli
bagarag
as
with
a
blow
and
he
cried
haste
o
princess
perchance
she
is
even
now
calling
to
me
with
her
tongue
and
i
not
aiding
her
delayed
by
the
temptation
of
this
crown
and
the
guile
of
the
brides
she
checked
him
and
said
aklis
no
haste
then
she
said
and
lo
fronting
them
the
single
blaze
became
two
fires
and
drawing
nigh
shibli
bagarag
beheld
them
what
they
were
angry
eyes
in
the
head
of
a
great
lion
a
model
of
majesty
and
passion
was
in
his
mane
and
power
was
in
his
forepaws
so
while
he
lashed
his
tail
as
a
tempest
whippeth
the
tawny
billows
at
night
and
was
lifting
himself
for
a
roar
she
said
hair
of
garraveen
and
touch
him
with
it
shibli
bagarag
pushed
up
his
sleeve
and
broke
one
of
the
three
sapphire
hairs
and
stepped
forward
to
the
lion
holding
in
his
right
hand
the
hair
of
vivid
light
the
lion
crouched
and
was
in
the
vigour
of
the
spring
when
that
hair
touched
him
and
he
trembled
tumbling
on
his
knees
and
letting
the
twain
pass
so
they
advanced
beyond
him
and
lo
the
cave
of
chrysolites
irradiate
with
beams
breaks
of
brilliance
confluences
of
lively
hues
restless
rays
meeting
vanishing
flooding
splendours
now
scattered
in
dazzling
joints
and
spars
now
uniting
in
momentary
disks
of
radiance
in
the
centre
of
the
cave
glowed
a
furnace
and
round
it
he
distinguished
the
seven
youths
swarthier
and
sterner
than
before
dark
sweat
standing
on
the
brows
of
each
their
words
were
brief
and
they
wore
each
a
terrible
frown
saying
to
him
without
further
salutation
in
the
flame
of
this
furnace
thy
right
wrist
at
the
same
moment
the
antelope
said
in
his
ear
thou
their
bidding
and
be
not
backward
in
aklis
fear
is
ruin
and
hesitation
a
destroyer
he
fixed
his
mind
on
the
devotedness
of
noorna
and
held
his
nether
lip
tightly
between
his
teeth
and
thrust
his
right
wrist
in
the
flame
of
the
furnace
the
wrist
reddened
and
became
transparent
with
heat
but
he
felt
no
pain
only
that
his
whole
arm
was
thrice
its
natural
weight
then
the
flame
of
the
furnace
fell
and
the
seven
youths
made
him
kneel
by
a
brook
of
golden
waters
and
dip
his
forehead
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
waters
then
they
took
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
cave
and
his
sight
was
strengthened
to
mark
the
glory
of
the
sword
where
it
hung
in
slings
a
little
way
from
the
wall
outshining
the
lights
of
the
cave
and
throwing
them
back
with
its
superior
force
and
stedfastness
of
lustre
lo
the
length
of
it
was
as
the
length
of
crimson
across
the
sea
when
the
sun
is
sideways
on
the
wave
and
it
seemed
full
a
mile
long
the
whole
blade
sheening
like
an
arrested
lightning
from
the
end
to
the
hilt
the
hilt
two
large
live
serpents
twined
together
with
eyes
like
sombre
jewels
and
sparkling
spotted
skins
points
of
fire
in
their
folds
and
reflections
of
the
emerald
and
topaz
and
ruby
stones
studded
in
the
haft
then
the
seven
young
men
sons
of
aklis
said
to
shibli
bagarag
the
lily
and
when
he
had
given
into
their
hands
the
lily
they
said
the
handle
of
the
sword
now
he
beheld
the
sword
and
the
ripples
of
violet
heat
that
were
breathing
down
it
and
those
two
venomous
serpents
twined
together
and
the
size
of
it
its
ponderousness
and
to
essay
lifting
it
appeared
to
him
a
madness
but
he
concealed
his
thought
and
setting
his
soul
on
the
safety
of
noorna
went
forward
to
it
boldly
and
piercing
his
right
arm
between
the
twists
of
the
serpents
grasped
the
jewelled
haft
surely
the
sword
moved
from
the
slings
as
if
a
giant
had
swayed
it
but
what
amazed
him
was
the
marvel
of
the
blade
for
its
sharpness
was
such
that
nothing
stood
in
its
way
and
it
slipped
through
everything
as
we
pass
through
still
water
the
stone
columns
blocks
of
granite
by
the
walls
the
walls
of
earth
and
the
thick
solidity
of
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
they
bade
him
say
to
the
sword
and
it
was
no
longer
than
a
knife
in
the
girdle
likewise
they
bade
him
hiss
on
the
heads
of
the
serpents
and
say
and
while
he
held
it
lengthwise
it
shot
lengthening
out
then
they
bade
him
hold
in
one
hand
the
sapphire
hair
that
conquered
the
lion
and
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
touch
one
point
of
it
so
he
did
that
and
it
split
in
half
and
the
two
halves
he
also
split
and
he
split
those
four
and
those
eight
till
the
hairs
were
thin
as
light
and
not
distinguishable
from
it
when
shibli
bagarag
saw
the
power
of
the
sword
he
exulted
and
cried
be
to
the
science
of
them
that
forecast
events
and
the
haps
of
life
now
in
the
meantime
he
marked
the
youths
take
those
hairs
of
garraveen
that
he
had
split
and
tie
them
round
the
neck
of
the
antelope
and
empty
the
contents
of
the
phial
down
her
throat
and
they
put
the
bulb
of
the
lily
that
was
a
heart
in
her
mouth
and
she
swallowed
it
till
the
flower
covered
her
face
then
they
took
each
a
handful
of
the
golden
waters
of
the
brook
flowing
through
the
cave
and
flung
the
waters
over
her
exclaiming
the
three
spells
that
have
power
in
aklis
and
by
which
these
waters
are
a
blessing
in
the
passing
of
a
flash
she
took
her
shape
and
was
a
damsel
taller
than
the
tallest
of
them
that
descend
from
the
mountains
a
vision
of
loveliness
with
queenly
brows
closed
red
lips
and
large
full
black
eyes
her
hair
black
and
on
it
a
net
of
amber
strung
with
pearls
to
look
upon
her
was
to
feel
the
tyranny
of
love
love
pangs
of
alarm
and
hope
and
anguish
and
she
was
dressed
in
a
dress
of
white
silk
threaded
with
gold
and
sapphire
showing
in
shadowy
beams
her
rounded
figure
and
the
stateliness
that
was
hers
so
she
ran
to
her
brothers
and
embraced
them
calling
them
by
their
names
catching
their
hands
caressing
them
as
one
that
had
been
long
parted
from
them
then
seeing
shibli
bagarag
as
he
stood
transfixed
with
the
javelins
of
loveliness
that
flew
from
her
on
all
sides
she
cried
o
master
of
the
event
halt
thou
nought
for
the
sword
but
to
gaze
before
thee
in
silliness
then
he
said
rare
in
beauty
marvel
of
aklis
and
the
world
surely
the
paradise
of
eyes
is
thy
figure
and
the
glory
of
thy
face
but
she
shouted
work
with
the
sword
shame
on
thee
is
there
not
one
a
bright
one
a
miracle
in
faithfulness
that
awaiteth
thy
rescue
on
the
pillar
and
she
repeated
the
praises
he
had
spoken
of
noorna
bin
noorka
his
betrothed
then
he
grasped
the
sword
firmly
remembering
the
love
of
noorna
and
crying
me
from
this
o
ye
sons
of
aklis
and
thou
princess
gulrevaz
lead
me
that
i
may
come
to
her
so
they
said
us
and
he
sheathed
the
sword
in
his
girdle
with
the
word
and
followed
them
his
heart
beating
violently

so

as
