the

housewife

cook

randolph
method
is
the
soul
of
management
preface
the
difficulties
i
encountered
when
i
first
entered
on
the
duties
of
a
housekeeping
life
from
the
want
of
books
sufficiently
clear
and
concise
to
impart
knowledge
to
a
tyro
compelled
me
to
study
the
subject
and
by
actual
experiment
to
reduce
every
thing
in
the
culinary
line
to
proper
weights
and
measures
this
method
i
found
not
only
to
diminish
the
necessary
attention
and
labour
but
to
be
also
economical
for
when
the
ingredients
employed
were
given
in
just
proportions
the
article
made
was
always
equally
good
the
government
of
a
family
bears
a
lilliputian
resemblance
to
the
government
of
a
nation
the
contents
of
the
treasury
must
be
known
and
great
care
taken
to
keep
the
expenditures
from
being
equal
to
the
receipts
a
regular
system
must
be
introduced
into
each
department
which
may
be
modified
until
matured
and
should
then
pass
into
an
inviolable
law
the
grand
arcanum
of
management
lies
in
three
simple
rules
let
every
thing
be
done
at
a
proper
time
keep
every
thing
in
its
proper
place
and
put
every
thing
to
its
proper
use
if
the
mistress
of
a
family
will
every
morning
examine
minutely
the
different
departments
of
her
household
she
must
detect
errors
in
their
infant
state
when
they
can
be
corrected
with
ease
but
a
few
growth
gives
them
gigantic
strength
and
disorder
with
all
her
attendant
evils
are
introduced
early
rising
is
also
essential
to
the
good
government
of
a
family
a
late
breakfast
deranges
the
whole
business
of
the
day
and
throws
a
portion
of
it
on
the
next
which
opens
the
door
for
confusion
to
enter
the
greater
part
of
the
following
receipts
have
been
written
from
memory
where
they
were
impressed
by
long
continued
practice
should
they
prove
serviceable
to
the
young
inexperienced
housekeeper
it
will
add
greatly
to
that
gratification
which
an
extensive
circulation
of
the
work
will
be
likely
to
confer
randolph
washington
january
introduction
management
is
an
art
that
may
be
acquired
by
every
woman
of
good
sense
and
tolerable
memory
if
unfortunately
she
has
been
bred
in
a
family
where
domestic
business
is
the
work
of
chance
she
will
have
many
difficulties
to
encounter
but
a
determined
resolution
to
obtain
this
valuable
knowledge
will
enable
her
to
surmount
all
obstacles
she
must
begin
the
day
with
an
early
breakfast
requiring
each
person
to
be
in
readiness
to
take
their
seats
when
the
muffins
buckwheat
cakes
are
placed
on
the
table
this
looks
social
and
comfortable
when
the
family
breakfast
by
detachments
the
table
remains
a
tedious
time
the
servants
are
kept
from
their
morning
meal
and
a
complete
derangement
takes
place
in
the
whole
business
of
the
day
no
work
can
be
done
till
breakfast
is
finished
the
virginia
ladies
who
are
proverbially
good
managers
employ
themselves
while
their
servants
are
eating
in
washing
the
cups
glasses
arranging
the
cruets
the
mustard
pickle
vases
and
all
the
apparatus
for
the
dinner
table
this
occupies
but
a
short
time
and
the
lady
has
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
they
are
in
much
better
order
than
they
would
be
if
left
to
the
servants
it
also
relieves
her
from
the
trouble
of
seeing
the
dinner
table
prepared
which
should
be
done
every
day
with
the
same
scrupulous
regard
to
exact
neatness
and
method
as
if
a
grand
company
was
expected
when
the
servant
is
required
to
do
this
daily
he
soon
gets
into
the
habit
of
doing
it
well
and
his
mistress
having
made
arrangements
for
him
in
the
morning
there
is
no
fear
of
bustle
and
confusion
in
running
after
things
that
may
be
called
for
during
the
hour
of
dinner
when
the
kitchen
breakfast
is
over
and
the
cook
has
put
all
things
in
their
proper
places
the
mistress
should
go
in
to
give
her
orders
let
all
the
articles
intended
for
the
dinner
pass
in
review
before
her
have
the
butter
sugar
flour
meal
lard
given
out
in
proper
quantities
the
catsup
spice
wine
whatever
may
be
wanted
for
each
dish
measured
to
the
cook
the
mistress
must
tax
her
own
memory
with
all
this
we
have
no
right
to
expect
slaves
or
hired
servants
to
be
more
attentive
to
our
interest
than
we
ourselves
are
they
will
never
recollect
these
little
articles
until
they
are
going
to
use
them
the
mistress
must
then
be
called
out
and
thus
have
the
horrible
drudgery
of
keeping
house
all
day
when
one
hour
devoted
to
it
in
the
morning
would
release
her
from
trouble
until
the
next
day
there
is
economy
as
well
as
comfort
in
a
regular
mode
of
doing
business
when
the
mistress
gives
out
every
thing
there
is
no
waste
but
if
temptation
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
subordinates
not
many
will
have
power
to
resist
it
besides
it
is
an
immoral
act
to
place
them
in
a
situation
which
we
pray
to
be
exempt
from
ourselves
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
a
family
depend
greatly
on
the
order
and
regularity
established
in
it
the
husband
who
can
ask
a
friend
to
partake
of
his
dinner
in
full
confidence
of
finding
his
wife
unruffled
by
the
petty
vexations
attendant
on
the
neglect
of
household
duties
who
can
usher
his
guest
into
the
assured
of
seeing
that
methodical
nicety
which
is
the
essence
of
true
elegance
will
feel
pride
and
exultation
in
the
possession
of
a
companion
who
gives
to
his
home
charms
that
gratify
every
wish
of
his
soul
and
render
the
haunts
of
dissipation
hateful
to
him
the
sons
bred
in
such
a
family
will
be
moral
men
of
steady
habits
and
the
daughters
if
the
mother
shall
have
performed
the
duties
of
a
parent
in
the
superintendence
of
their
education
as
faithfully
as
she
has
done
those
of
a
wife
will
each
be
a
treasure
to
her
husband
and
being
formed
on
the
model
of
an
exemplary
mother
will
use
the
same
means
for
securing
the
happiness
of
her
own

solution
fifteen
quarts
of
good
clean
liverpool
salt
and
one
pound
of
saltpetre
this
brine
will
be
strong
enough
to
bear
up
an
egg
if
more
salt
be
added
it
will
fall
to
the
bottom
without
strengthening
the
brine
the
water
being
already
saturated
this
brine
will
cure
all
the
beef
which
a
private
family
can
use
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
requires
nothing
more
to
be
done
to
it
except
occasionally
skimming
the
dross
that
rises
it
must
be
kept
in
a
cool
dry
place
for
salting
your
beef
get
a
molasses
hogshead
and
saw
it
in
two
that
the
beef
may
have
space
to
lie
on
bore
some
holes
in
the
bottom
of
these
tubs
and
raise
them
on
one
side
about
an
inch
that
the
bloody
brine
may
run
off
be
sure
that
your
beef
is
newly
killed
rub
each
piece
very
well
with
good
liverpool
salt
a
vast
deal
depends
upon
rubbing
the
salt
into
every
part
it
is
unnecessary
to
put
saltpetre
on
it
sprinkle
a
good
deal
of
salt
on
the
bottom
of
the
tub
when
the
beef
is
well
salted
lay
it
in
the
tub
and
be
sure
you
put
the
fleshy
side
downward
put
a
great
deal
of
salt
on
your
beef
after
it
is
packed
in
the
tub
this
protects
it
from
animals
who
might
eat
if
they
could
smell
it
and
does
not
waste
the
salt
for
the
beef
can
only
dissolve
a
certain
portion
you
must
let
the
beef
lie
in
salt
ten
days
then
take
it
out
brush
off
the
salt
and
wipe
it
with
a
damp
cloth
put
it
in
the
brine
with
a
bit
of
board
and
weight
to
keep
it
under
in
about
ten
days
it
will
look
red
and
be
fit
for
the
table
but
it
will
be
red
much
sooner
when
the
brine
becomes
older
the
best
time
to
begin
to
salt
beef
is
the
latter
end
of
october
if
the
weather
be
cool
and
from
that
time
have
it
in
succession
when
your
beef
is
taken
out
of
the
tub
stir
the
salt
about
to
dry
that
it
may
be
ready
for
the
next
pieces
tongues
are
cured
in
the
same
manner
to
dry
beef
for
summer
use
the
best
pieces
for
this
purpose
are
the
thin
briskets
or
that
part
of
the
plate
which
is
farthest
from
the
shoulder
of
the
animal
the
round
and
rib
pieces
which
are
commonly
used
for
roasting
these
should
not
be
cut
with
long
ribs
and
the
must
be
sawed
off
as
close
as
possible
that
the
piece
may
lay
flat
in
the
dish
about
the
middle
of
february
select
your
beef
from
an
animal
well
fatted
with
corn
and
which
when
killed
will
weigh
one
hundred
and
fifty
per
quarter
larger
oxen
are
always
coarse
salt
the
pieces
as
directed
let
them
lie
one
fortnight
then
put
them
in
brine
where
they
must
remain
three
weeks
take
them
out
at
the
end
of
the
time
wipe
them
quite
dry
rub
them
over
with
bran
and
hang
them
in
a
cool
dry
and
if
possible
dark
place
that
the
flies
may
not
get
to
them
they
must
be
suspended
and
not
allowed
to
touch
any
thing
it
will
be
necessary
in
the
course
of
the
summer
to
look
them
over
occasionally
and
after
a
long
wet
season
to
lay
them
in
the
sun
a
few
hours
your
tongues
may
be
dried
in
the
same
manner
make
a
little
hole
in
the
root
run
a
twine
through
it
and
suspend
it
these
dried
meats
must
be
put
in
a
good
quantity
of
water
to
soak
the
night
before
they
are
to
be
used
in
boiling
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
have
a
large
quantity
of
water
to
put
the
beef
in
while
the
water
is
cold
to
boil
steadily
skimming
the
pot
until
the
bones
are
ready
to
fall
out
and
if
a
tongue
till
the
skin
peels
off
with
perfect
ease
the
skin
must
also
be
taken
from
the
beef
the
housekeeper
who
will
buy
good
ox
beef
and
follow
these
directions
exactly
may
be
assured
of
always
having
delicious
beef
on
her
table
ancient
prejudice
has
established
a
notion
that
meat
killed
in
the
decrease
of
the
moon
will
draw
up
when
cooked
the
true
cause
of
this
shrinking
may
be
found
in
the
old
age
of
the
animal
or
in
its
diseased
state
at
the
time
of
killing
the
best
age
is
from
three
to
five
years
few
persons
are
aware
of
the
injury
they
sustain
by
eating
the
flesh
of
diseased
animals
none
but
the
jewish
butchers
who
are
paid
exclusively
for
it
attend
to
this
important
circumstance
the
best
rule
for
judging
that
i
have
been
able
to
discover
is
the
colour
of
the
fat
when
the
fat
of
beef
is
a
high
shade
of
yellow
i
reject
it
if
the
fat
of
veal
mutton
lamb
or
pork
have
the
slightest
tinge
of
yellow
i
avoid
it
as
diseased
the
same
rule
holds
good
when
applied
to
poultry
to
corn
beef
in
hot
weather
take
a
piece
of
thin
brisket
or
plate
cut
out
the
ribs
nicely
rub
it
on
both
sides
well
with
two
large
spoonsful
of
pounded
saltpetre
pour
on
it
a
gill
of
molasses
and
a
quart
of
salt
rub
them
both
in
put
it
in
a
vessel
just
large
enough
to
hold
it
but
not
tight
for
the
bloody
brine
must
run
off
as
it
makes
or
the
meat
will
spoil
let
it
be
well
covered
top
bottom
and
sides
with
the
molasses
and
salt
in
four
days
you
may
boil
it
tied
up
in
a
cloth
with
the
salt
about
it
when
done
take
the
skin
off
nicely
and
serve
it
up
if
you
have
an
or
refrigerator
it
will
be
best
to
keep
it
there
a
fillet
or
breast
of
veal
and
a
leg
or
rack
of
mutton
are
excellent
done
in
the
same
way
important
observations
on
roasting
boiling
frying
in
roasting
butchers
meat
be
careful
not
to
run
the
spit
through
the
nice
parts
let
the
piece
lie
in
water
one
hour
then
wash
it
out
wipe
it
perfectly
dry
and
put
it
on
the
spit
set
it
before
a
clear
steady
fire
sprinkle
some
salt
on
it
and
when
it
becomes
hot
baste
it
for
a
time
with
salt
and
water
then
put
a
good
spoonful
of
nice
lard
into
the
and
when
melted
continue
to
baste
with
it
when
your
meat
of
whatever
kind
has
been
down
some
time
but
before
it
begins
to
look
brown
cover
it
with
paper
and
baste
on
it
when
it
is
nearly
done
take
off
the
paper
dredge
it
with
flour
turn
the
spit
for
some
minutes
very
quick
and
baste
all
the
time
to
raise
a
froth
after
which
serve
it
up
when
mutton
is
roasted
after
you
take
off
the
paper
loosen
the
skin
and
peel
it
off
carefully
then
dredge
and
froth
it
up
beef
and
mutton
must
not
be
roasted
as
much
as
veal
lamb
or
pork
the
two
last
must
be
skinned
in
the
manner
directed
for
mutton
you
may
pour
a
little
melted
butter
in
the
dish
with
veal
but
all
the
others
must
be
served
without
sauce
and
garnished
with
nicely
scraped
be
careful
not
to
let
a
particle
of
dry
flour
be
seen
on
the
meat
it
has
a
very
ill
appearance
beef
may
look
brown
but
the
whiter
the
other
meats
are
the
more
genteel
are
they
and
if
properly
roasted
they
may
be
perfectly
done
and
quite
white
a
loin
of
veal
and
hind
quarter
of
lamb
should
be
dished
with
the
kidneys
uppermost
and
be
sure
to
joint
every
thing
that
is
to
be
separated
at
table
or
it
will
be
impossible
to
carve
neatly
for
those
who
have
gravy
with
these
meats
let
it
be
made
in
any
way
they
like
and
served
in
a
boat
no
meat
can
be
well
roasted
except
on
a
spit
turned
by
a
jack
and
before
a
steady
clear
fire
other
methods
are
no
better
than
baking
many
cooks
are
in
the
habit
of
half
boiling
the
meats
to
plump
them
as
they
term
it
before
they
are
spitted
but
it
destroys
their
fine
flavour
whatever
is
to
be
boiled
must
be
put
into
cold
water
with
a
little
salt
which
will
cook
them
regularly
when
they
are
put
in
boiling
water
the
outer
side
is
done
too
much
before
the
inside
gets
heated
nice
lard
is
much
better
than
butter
for
basting
roasted
meats
or
for
frying
to
choose
butchers
meat
you
must
see
that
the
fat
is
not
yellow
and
that
the
lean
parts
are
of
a
fine
close
grain
a
lively
colour
and
will
feel
tender
when
pinched
poultry
should
be
well
covered
with
white
fat
if
the

be
gristly
it
is

before
it
is

on
to
boil
and
be
sure
to
add
salt
to
the
water
fish
and
all
other
articles

should
be
made
hot
either
by

them
over

very
enticing
when
the

rises
from

have
a
double
relish

is
not

a
dinner
justly
calculated
for
the
company
and
consisting
for
the
greater
part
of
small
articles
correctly
prepared
and
neatly
served
up
will
make
a
much
more
pleasing
appearance
to
the
sight
and
give
a
far
greater
gratification
to
the
appetite
than
a
table
loaded
with
food
and
from
the
multiplicity
of
dishes
unavoidably
neglected
in
the

and
served
up

at

they

six

remember
to
hang

down
to
preserve

good
smoke
every

be
careful
not
to
have
a

the
should
stand
alone

any
additional
heat
will
spoil

beginning
the
first
of

it
should
be
occasionally
taken
down
examined
rubbed
with
hickory
ashes
and
hung
up
again
the
generally
received
opinion
that
saltpetre
hardens
meat
is
entirely
erroneous
it
tends
greatly
to
prevent
putrefaction
but
will
not
make
it
hard
neither
will
laying
in
brine
five
or
six
weeks
in
cold
weather
have
that
effect
but
remaining
in
salt
too
long
will
certainly
draw
off
the
juices
and
harden
it
bacon

quantity
of
water
and

not
done
sufficiently
till
the

new
bacon
requires
much
longer
boiling
than
that
which
is
old
to
make
souse
let
all
the
pieces
you
intend
to
souse
remain
covered
with
cold
water
twelve
hours
then
wash
them
out
wipe
off
the
blood
and
put
them
again

soak
them
in
this
manner
changing
the
water
frequently
and
keeping
it
in
a
cool

is
drawn
away
scrape
and
clean
each
piece
perfectly
nice
mix
some
meal
with

to
it

boil
your
souse
gently
until
you
can
run
a
straw
into
the
skin
with
ease
do
not
put
too
much
in
the
pot
for
it
will
boil
to
pieces
and
spoil
the
appearance
the
best
way
is
to
boil
the
feet
in
one
pot
the
ears
and
nose
in
another
and
the
heads
in
a
third
these
should
be
boiled
till
you
can
take
all
the
bones
out
let
them
get
cold

the
insides
with
pepper
salt
and
a

nutmeg
make
it
in

sew
it
up

just
enough
to
look
white
add
salt
and
of
vinegar
put
your
souse
in
different
pots
and
keep
it
well
covered
with
this
mixture
and
closely
stopped
it
will
be
necessary
to
renew
this
liquor
every
two
or
three
weeks
let
your
souse
get
quite
cold
after
boiling
before
you
put
it
in
the
liquor
and
be
sure
to
use
pale
coloured
vinegar
or
the
souse
will
be
dark
some
cooks
singe
the
hair
from
the
feet
but
this
destroys
the
colour
good
souse
will
always
be
white

roast
a

the
pig
must
be
very
fat
nicely
cleaned
and
not
too
large
to
lie
in

chop
the

fine
and
mix
it
with

make
it
into
a

sew
it
up
spit

have
a

water
at
first
then
rub
it
frequently
with
a
lump
of
lard
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
clean
linen
this
will
make
it
much
more
crisp
than

it
from
the
dripping
pan
when
the

is
done
take
off
the

fish
to
cure
herrings
the
best
method
for
preserving
herrings
and
which
may
be
followed
with
ease
for
a
small
family
is
to
take
the
brine
left
of
your
winter
stock
for
beef
to
the
fishing
place
and
when
the
seine
is
hauled
to
pick
out
the
largest
herrings
and
throw
them
alive
into
the
brine
let
them
remain
hours
take
them
out
and
lay
them
on
sloping
planks
that
the
brine
may
drain
off
have
a
tight
barrel
put
some
coarse
alum
salt
at
the
bottom
then
put
in
a
layer
of
herrings
take
care
not
to
bruise
them
sprinkle
over
it
alum
salt
and
some
saltpetre
then
fish
salt
and
saltpetre
till
the
barrel
is
full
keep
a
board
over
it
should
they
not
make
brine
enough
to
cover
them
in
a
few
weeks
you
must
add
some
for
they
will
be
rusty
if
not
kept
under
brine
the
proper
time
to
salt
them
is
when
they
are
quite
fat
the
scales
will
adhere
closely
to
a
lean
herring
but
will
be
loose
on
a
fat
one
the
former
is
not
fit
to
be
eaten
do
not
be
sparing
of
salt
when
you
put
them
up
when
they
are
to
be
used
take
a
few
out
of
brine
soak
them
an
hour
or
two
scale
them
nicely
pull
off
the
gills
and
the
only
entrail
they
have
will
come
with
them
wash
them
clean
and
hang
them
up
to
dry
when
to
be
broiled
take
half
a
sheet
of
white
paper
rub
it
over
with
butter
put
the
herring
in
double
the
edges
securely
and
broil
without
burning
it
the
brine
the
herrings
drink
before
they
die
has
a
wonderful
effect
in
preserving
their
juices

or
two
years

they
are

a
great
variety
of
delicious
sauces
can
be
made
by

them
exceedingly
fine
and
stir
them
in
the

when
it
begins
to
melt
when
herbs
are
added
to

you
must
put
two
spoonsful
of
water
instead
of
one
chervil
young
fennel
burnet
tarragon
and
cress
or
may
all
be
used
and
must
be
prepared
in
the
same
manner
as
the
parsley
caper
sauce
is
made
by
mixing
a
sufficient
quantity
of
capers
and
adding
them
to
the
melted
butter
with
a
little
of
the

gives
a
fine

it
will
impart
a
pleasant
flavour
of

a
very
delicious
flavour
of
thyme
may
be
obtained
by
gathering
it
when
in
full
perfection
it
must
be
picked
from

this
is
greatly
preferable
to
the
dried
thyme
commonly
used
during

season
when
it
can
not
be
obtained
in
a
fresh
state
mint
may
be
prepared
in
the

way
the
flavour
of
both
these
herbs
must
be
preserved
by
care

preparation
if
permitted
to
stand
more
than
twenty
hours
in

prepare
the

or
make
them
so
by
dividing
the
large
ones
put
to
them
as
much
cold
water
as
will
cover
them
about
an
inch
they
are
sooner
boiled
and
more
savoury
than
when
drowned
in
water
most
boiled
things
are
spoiled
by
having
too
little
water
but
potatos
are
often
spoiled
by
having
too
much
they
must
merely
be
covered
and
a
little
allowed
for
waste
in
boiling
so
that
they
must
be
just
covered
when
done
set
them
on
a
moderate
fire
till
they
boil
then
take
them
off
and
set
them
by
the
fire
to
simmer
slowly
till
they
are
soft
enough
to
admit
a
fork
place
no
dependence
on
the
usual
test
of
their
skin
cracking
which
if
they
are
boiled
fast
will
happen
to
some
potatos
when
they
are
not
half
done
and
the
inside
is
quite
hard
then
pour
off
the
water
if
you
let
the
potatos
remain
in
the
water
a
moment
after
they
are
done
enough
they
will
become
waxy
and
watery
uncover
the
and
set
it
at
such
a
distance
from
the
fire
as
will
secure
it
from
burning
their
superfluous
moisture
will
evaporate
and
the
potatos
will
be
perfectly
dry
and
mealy
you
may
afterwards
place
a
napkin
folded
up
to
the
size
of
the
diameter
over
the
potatos
to
keep
them
dry
and
mealy
till

this
method
of

in
every
respect
equal
to
steaming

will
taste
bitter

boils

then
your
vegetables
they
are
still
better
boiled
with
bacon
in
the
virginia
style
if
fresh
and
young
they
will
be
done
in
about
twenty
minutes
drain
them

send
up
the

whole
when
they

young
is
much
the
best
method
and
their
delicate
flavour
and
colour
is
much
better
preserved
when
a
little
more
grown
they
must
be
cut
lengthwise
in
thin
slices
after
stringing
and
for
common
tables
they
are
split
and
divided
across

those
who
are

do
not
use
them
at
such
a
growth
as
to
require
splitting
artichokes
soak
them

wash
them
well

boil
gently
till

will
take
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
the
surest
way
to
know
when
they
are
done
enough
is
to
draw
out
a
leaf
trim
them
and
drain
them
on
a
sieve
and
send
up
melted
butter
with
them
with
some
put
into
small
cups
so
that
each
guest
may
have
one
brocoli
the

patent
yeast
put

persons
who
live
in

procure
brewer
yeast
will
save
trouble
by
using
it
take
one

it
add
a

as
before
directed
to

the
best
thing
to
keep
yeast
in
is
a

must
be
placed
a

observations
on
ice
creams
it
is
the
practice
with
some
indolent
cooks
to
set
the
freezer
containing
the
cream
in
a
tub
with
ice
and
salt
and
put
it
in
the
ice
house
it
will
certainly
freeze
there
but
not
until
the
watery
particles
have
subsided
and
by
the
separation
destroyed
the
cream
a
freezer
should
be
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
deep
and
eight
or
ten
wide
this
facilitates
the
operation
very
much
by
giving
a
larger
surface
for
the
ice
to
form
which
it
always
does
on
the
sides
of
the
vessel
a
silver
spoon
with
a
long
handle
should
be
provided
for
scraping
the
ice
from
the
sides
as
soon
as
formed
and
when
the
whole
is
congealed
pack
it
in
moulds
which
must
be
placed
with
care
lest
they
should
not
be
upright
in
ice
and
salt
till
sufficiently
hard
to
retain
the
shape
they
should
not
be
turned
out
till
the
moment
they
are
to
be
served
the
freezing
tub
must
be
wide
enough
to
leave
a
margin
of
four
or
five
inches
all
around
the
freezer
when
placed
in
the
middle
which
must
be
filled
up
with
small
lumps
of
ice
mixed
with
salt
a
larger
tub
would
waste
the
ice
the
freezer
must
be
kept
constantly
in
motion
during
the
process
and
ought
to
be
made
of
pewter
which
is
less
liable
than
tin
to
be
worn
in
holes
and
spoil
the
cream
by
admitting
the
salt

creams
when
ice

are
not
put
into
shapes
they
should
always
be

strawberry
cream
is
made
in

preserves
directions
for
making
preserves
the
preserving
pan
should
be
made
of
bell
metal
flat
at
the
bottom
very
large
in
diameter
but
not
deep
it
should
have
a
cover
to
fit
closely
and
handles
at
the
sides
of
the
pan
for
taking
it
off
with
ease
when
the
syrup
boils
too
fast
there
should
also
be
a
large
with
long
legs
for
the
convenience
of
moving
it
to
any
part
of
the
room
the
process
is
a
tedious
one
and
if
the
superintendent
be
not
comfortably
situated
the
preserves
can
not
be
properly
managed
a
ladle
the
size
of
a
saucer
pierced
and
having
a
long
handle
will
be
necessary
for
taking
up
the
fruit
without
syrup
when
a
can
not
be
procured
the
best
substitute
is
a
brick
stove
with
a
grating
to
burn
charcoal
the
sugar
should
be
the
best
double
refined
but
if
the
pure
amber
coloured
sugar
house
syrup
from
the
west
indies
can
be
got
it
is
greatly
superior
it
never
ferments
and
the
trouble
is
very
much
lessened
by
having
ready
made
syrup
in
which
it
is
only
necessary
to
boil
the
fruit
till
clear
all
delicate
fruit
should
be
done
gently
and
not
allowed
to
remain
more
than
half
an
hour
after
it
begins
to
stew
before
it
is
laid
on
dishes
to
cool
it
must
be
put
into
the
syrup
again
for
the
same
time
continue
this
until
it
is
sufficiently
transparent
the
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
the
preserves
are
less
liable
to
boil
to
pieces
than
when
done
all
at
one
time
it
is
injudicious
to
put
more
in
the
pan
at
once
than
can
lie
on
the
bottom
without
crowding
the
pan
must
be
made
bright
and
nothing
permitted
to
cool
in
it
lest
it
should
canker
delicate
preserves
should
be
kept
in
small
glasses
or
pots
that
will
not
hold
more
than
one
or
two
pounds
for
the
admission
of
air
injures
them
put
letter
paper
wet
with
brandy
on
the
preserves
and
cover
the
tops
with
many
folds
of
soft
paper
that
will
tie
round

them
in
a
dry
place
and
expose
them
constantly

the

observations
on

the
vessels
for
keeping
pickles
should
be
made
of
stone
ware
straight
from
the
bottom

with

covers
to
them
when
the

is
very
wide
the

may
be
taken
out
without
breaking
them
the
motive
for
keeping
all
pickles
in
plain
vinegar
previous
to
putting
them
in
the
prepared
pot
is
to
draw
off
the
water
with
which
they
are
saturated
that
they
may
not
weaken
the

of

boil

a

very
strong

next

cut
out
the

melt
it

cool
it
again
this
takes
out
all
the

and
keeps
the

from
shrinking
when
dried
a
strict
conformity
to
these
rules
will
banish

soft
soap
is
made
in
the

manner
only
omitting
the

it
may
also
be
made
by
putting
the

together
in
