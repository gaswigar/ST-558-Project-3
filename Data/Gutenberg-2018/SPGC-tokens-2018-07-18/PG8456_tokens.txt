chapter
i
her
father
plan
how
old
are
you
patty
asked
her
father
abruptly
fourteen
papa
why
my
conscience
what
a
great
girl
you
getting
to
be
stand
up
and
let
me
look
at
you
patty
fairfield
with
two
twists
and
a
spring
brought
herself
to
her
feet
and
stood
awaiting
her
father
inspection
he
saw
a
slender
graceful
girl
a
southern
blonde
of
the
purest
type
her
pretty
golden
hair
would
gladly
have
hung
in
curly
masses
but
it
was
only
allowed
to
have
its
own
sweet
will
around
her
temples
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
thick
braid
her
eyes
were
blue
deep
and
twinkly
and
the
rest
of
her
face
was
as
pretty
and
sweet
as
soft
girlish
contours
and
a
perfect
complexion
could
make
it
but
best
of
all
was
the
gentle
expression
and
frank
smile
which
so
often
broke
into
mischievous
dimples
it
did
on
this
occasion
and
patty
laughed
merrily
at
her
father
grave
consideration
of
her
what
is
it
papa
she
asked
did
you
think
i
was
still
an
infant
and
were
you
going
to
buy
me
a
new
dolls
house
or
were
you
going
to
take
me
to
the
circus
i
not
a
bit
too
old
for
the
circus
are
you
then
i
will
take
you
but
what
is
on
my
mind
at
present
is
a
much
more
serious
matter
sit
down
again
puss
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
you
know
for
years
i
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
you
should
grow
up
to
be
old
enough
to
keep
house
for
me
and
i
thought
then
we
go
back
north
and
settle
down
among
my
people
and
your
mother
relatives
i
have
been
north
since
your
mother
died
but
now
i
want
to
go
and
i
want
you
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
there
in
many
ways
it
will
be
better
for
you
than
virginia
you
will
have
more
advantages
your
life
will
be
broader
and
more
varied
now
i
ca
be
ready
to
leave
here
for
good
in
less
than
a
year
i
want
to
sell
out
my
lumber
interests
and
settle
up
my
business
affairs
but
i
am
continually
receiving
letters
from
your
aunts
you
have
lots
of
aunts
patty
and
they
are
apparently
all
anxious
that
you
shall
visit
them
so
if
you
consent
this
is
my
plan
you
never
traveled
any
have
you
puss
never
been
out
of
virginia
in
my
life
papa
no
well
you
ought
to
see
a
little
of
how
the
rest
of
the
world
lives
and
moves
so
i
think
i
let
you
visit
in
the
north
for
a
year
say
three
months
with
each
of
your
four
aunts
and
then
next
fall
i
be
ready
to
join
you
and
we
buy
a
house
and
you
shall
be
mistress
of
it
a
home
of
our
own
oh
papa
i
like
that
lots
yes
so
would
i
as
we
have
always
lived
in
since
your
mother
death
you
had
no
opportunity
to
learn
the
details
of
housekeeping
and
these
four
visits
will
show
you
four
very
distinct
types
of
families
why
are
my
aunts
all
so
different
papa
indeed
they
are
and
though
i
hope
you
can
make
yourself
happy
with
each
one
yet
you
will
find
life
very
different
in
the
various
homes
tell
me
about
them
papa
said
patty
contentedly
settling
herself
back
among
the
cushions
of
the
couch
for
she
dearly
loved
a
long
talk
with
her
father
well
you
will
go
first
to
the
clairs
you
remember
uncle
robert
your
mother
brother
who
was
here
four
or
five
years
ago
do
you
indeed
i
do
he
brought
me
a
french
doll
nearly
as
big
as
i
was
then
myself
and
a
whole
box
of
candy
he
is
a
lovely
man
but
never
seen
aunt
isabel
or
the
children
only
their
photographs
your
aunt
isabel
is
but
no
i
wo
tell
you
anything
about
your
relatives
you
may
discover
their
faults
and
virtues
for
yourself
most
of
all
my
child
you
will
need
to
cultivate
your
sense
of
proportion
do
you
know
what
proportion
means
oh
yes
papa
i
studied
and
proportion
in
arithmetic
not
that
kind
said
her
father
smiling
i
mean
a
proportion
of
human
interests
of
amusements
or
occupations
i
wonder
if
you
too
young
to
understand
no
i
not
too
young
to
understand
said
patty
fairly
blinking
in
her
endeavor
to
look
as
wise
as
an
owl
well
then
listen
while
i
put
it
this
way
suppose
you
were
to
make
a
cake
an
ordinary
sized
cake
you
know
how
much
yeast
would
you
put
in
it
not
any
papa
said
patty
laughing
merrily
i
know
enough
housekeeping
not
to
put
yeast
in
a
cake
i
use
yes
said
her
father
quite
undisturbed
that
is
what
i
meant
now
how
much
of
it
would
you
use
well
about
two
teaspoonfuls
said
patty
feeling
very
important
and
housewifely
yes
now
suppose
instead
of
two
teaspoonfuls
you
put
in
two
cupfuls
why
then
i
would
have
any
cake
at
all
i
reckon
it
would
rise
right
up
the
chimney
and
run
down
on
the
roof
outside
well
that
shows
just
what
i
mean
there
be
a
too
great
proportion
of
would
there
indeed
there
would
assented
patty
much
interested
in
the
conversation
but
a
little
bewildered
to
try
again
her
father
continued
suppose
your
frock
was
so
covered
by
trimming
that
the
material
could
scarcely
be
seen
at
all
then
said
patty
who
was
rapidly
learning
her
lesson
then
there
be
too
great
a
proportion
of
trimming
for
the
frock
ah
said
her
father
you
begin
to
see
my
drift
do
you
and
if
you
had
all
tables
in
your
house
and
no
chairs
or
bedsteads
or
bureaus
there
be
too
great
a
proportion
of
tables
would
there
yes
and
i
perceive
said
patty
slowly
and
with
mock
gravity
that
proportion
means
to
have
too
many
of
one
thing
when
you
better
have
a
lot
of
others
no
you
all
wrong
that
is
a
lack
of
proportion
proportion
is
to
have
exactly
the
right
amount
of
each
ingredient
yes
and
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
aunt
isabel
does
she
put
too
much
in
her
cake
or
has
she
nothing
but
tables
in
her
house
those
my
dear
were
only
figures
of
speech
but
if
you
going
to
make
a
home
for
your
old
father
next
year
i
want
you
to
learn
from
observation
what
are
the
principal
ingredients
to
put
into
it
and
then
learn
to
adjust
the
proportions
papa
i
believe
i
do
know
what
you
mean
but
it
all
out
of
proportion
when
you
call
yourself
old
father
for
you
not
old
a
bit
you
a
beautiful
young
man
and
i
sure
any
one
who
did
know
us
would
take
you
for
my
brother
come
come
puss
you
must
be
so
flattering
or
i
keep
you
here
and
not
let
you
go
north
at
all
and
i
do
believe
you
just
dying
to
go
i
like
it
lots
if
you
were
going
too
but
to
be
away
from
you
a
whole
year
is
no
fun
at
all
ca
i
wait
until
next
fall
and
we
go
together
no
patsie
your
aunts
are
urging
me
to
let
you
visit
them
and
i
think
the
experiences
will
do
you
good
and
beside
my
plans
for
the
next
year
are
very
uncertain
i
may
have
to
go
to
bermuda
to
see
about
my
plantation
there
and
all
things
considered
i
think
you
would
be
better
off
in
the
north
i
shall
miss
you
of
course
but
a
year
soon
slips
away
you
know
and
it
will
fly
very
quickly
for
you
as
you
will
be
highly
entertained
with
your
new
experiences
now
patty
fairfield
was
a
philosophic
little
girl
so
when
she
found
that
her
father
mind
was
made
up
she
accepted
the
situation
and
offered
no
objections
of
any
kind
and
indeed
the
new
plan
was
not
without
its
charm
although
she
knew
none
of
her
aunts
she
knew
a
great
deal
about
them
and
their
northern
homes
seemed
attractive
to
her
in
many
ways
what
about
school
papa
she
said
finally
that
will
be
left
to
the
judgment
of
each
aunt
in
turn
i
think
aunt
isabel
has
a
governess
for
her
children
and
aunt
hester
will
probably
teach
you
herself
but
you
will
learn
enough
and
if
not
you
can
consider
it
a
year
vacation
and
i
put
you
back
in
school
when
i
am
with
you
again
well
said
patty
meditatively
i
think
it
will
be
very
nice
and
like
it
but
i
be
awful
lonesome
for
you
and
with
a
spring
she
jumped
into
her
father
arms
yes
of
course
my
baby
we
be
homesick
for
each
other
but
we
be
brave
and
when
we
feel
lonesome
we
sit
down
and
write
each
other
nice
long
letters
oh
that
will
be
fun
i
love
letters
and
here
comes
clara
may
i
tell
her
about
it
yes
and
tell
her
she
must
come
to
see
me
once
in
a
while
and
cheer
me
after
i
lose
my
own
little
girl
clara
hayden
was
patty
intimate
friend
and
both
the
girls
hearts
grew
sad
at
the
thought
of
parting
but
said
patty
who
was
determined
to
look
on
the
bright
side
after
a
year
papa
and
i
will
have
a
house
of
our
own
and
then
you
can
come
and
make
us
a
long
long
visit
and
we
can
write
letters
clara
and
you
must
tell
me
all
about
the
girls
and
about
school
and
about
the
magnolia
club
yes
i
will
and
you
write
to
me
about
all
you
do
at
your
aunts
houses
where
do
they
live
patty
well
i
shall
go
first
to
aunt
isabel
and
she
lives
in
elmbridge
that
in
new
jersey
but
it
quite
near
new
york
next
i
going
to
aunt
hester
she
lives
in
boston
then
i
going
to
visit
aunt
grace
they
live
in
philadelphia
but
i
be
with
them
in
the
summertime
and
then
they
at
their
country
place
somewhere
on
long
island
wherever
that
may
be
and
the
last
one
is
aunt
alice
and
i
forget
the
name
of
the
town
where
she
lives
is
it
nice
clara
to
have
so
many
aunts
yes
lovely
i
suppose
you
go
to
new
york
often
i
do
know
i
think
i
afraid
of
new
york
they
say
it
an
awful
dangerous
place
yes
it
is
people
get
killed
there
all
the
time
fiddlesticks
i
do
believe
they
do
well
i
reckon
i
wo
get
killed
uncle
robert
will
take
better
care
of
me
than
that
chapter
ii
traveling
north
as
a
result
of
many
letters
back
and
forth
between
fairfield
and
the
northern
aunts
patty
stood
one
morning
on
the
platform
of
the
railway
station
all
ready
to
depart
for
her
new
homes
it
was
the
first
week
in
december
and
the
little
girl
shivered
as
she
thought
of
the
arctic
cold
to
which
she
imagined
herself
going
of
course
they
meet
me
in
a
sleigh
wo
they
papa
she
said
perhaps
so
but
i
doubt
it
he
replied
they
do
have
such
snowstorms
in
jersey
now
as
they
used
to
when
i
was
a
boy
last
winter
they
had
no
sleighing
at
all
but
here
comes
miss
powers
let
us
go
to
greet
her
miss
powers
was
a
lady
who
came
marching
along
the
platform
with
a
firm
step
patty
was
to
travel
in
her
care
not
because
she
was
an
especially
desirable
traveling
companion
but
because
she
was
the
only
acquaintance
of
the
fairfields
who
chanced
to
be
going
north
at
that
time
she
cried
are
you
here
already
i
was
certain
you
be
late
and
miss
the
train
not
a
very
pleasant
day
is
it
i
wish
we
had
planned
to
go
instead
why
patty
you
are
wearing
your
best
hat
you
spoil
it
i
sure
have
you
your
trunk
check
give
it
to
me
certainly
lose
it
else
here
it
is
miss
powers
said
fairfield
pleasantly
and
i
dare
say
you
will
prove
more
responsible
than
my
daughter
he
squeezed
patty
hand
affectionately
as
he
said
this
and
a
great
wave
of
homesickness
came
over
the
child
heart
she
caught
her
father
round
the
neck
and
vainly
trying
to
keep
the
tears
back
she
whispered
oh
papa
dear
let
me
stay
with
you
i
do
want
to
go
to
aunt
isabel
i
know
she
horrid
and
i
just
want
you
you
miss
powers
was
shocked
at
this
exhibition
of
emotion
and
said
with
asperity
come
come
it
too
late
to
talk
like
that
now
and
a
big
girl
like
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
act
so
babyish
but
fairfield
kissed
patty
tenderly
and
said
dear
we
going
to
be
very
brave
you
know
and
besides
you
only
going
for
a
visit
all
people
go
visiting
at
some
time
in
their
lives
and
next
december
i
be
shaking
the
dust
of
richmond
off
of
my
feet
and
coming
after
you
patty
smiled
through
her
tears
and
then
the
train
came
tooting
along
and
they
all
climbed
aboard
as
the
train
waited
for
ten
minutes
fairfield
had
ample
time
to
find
the
seats
engaged
for
the
travelers
and
to
arrange
their
in
the
racks
provided
for
it
then
he
bade
miss
powers
and
turning
to
patty
clasped
her
in
his
arms
as
he
said
pattykins
the
year
will
soon
pass
away
and
then
we
have
a
jolly
little
home
together
be
brave
and
gentle
always
and
as
a
parting
gift
i
give
you
this
little
box
which
contains
a
talisman
to
help
you
bear
any
troubles
or
difficulties
that
may
come
to
you
as
he
spoke
he
put
into
patty
hand
a
small
parcel
sealed
at
each
end
with
red
do
open
it
now
he
continued
keep
it
just
as
it
is
until
you
reach
aunt
isabel
then
after
you
have
gone
to
your
room
on
the
first
night
of
your
stay
with
her
open
the
box
and
see
what
is
in
it
then
the
warning
whistle
blew
and
with
a
final
embrace
of
his
little
daughter
fairfield
left
the
car
the
train
started
and
for
a
moment
patty
saw
her
father
waving
his
handkerchief
and
then
he
was
lost
to
her
sight
she
felt
just
like
indulging
in
a
good
cry
but
miss
powers
would
have
none
of
that
the
worthy
spinster
was
already
opening
her
bag
and
preparing
to
make
herself
comfortable
for
her
journey
now
patty
she
said
but
not
unkindly
you
left
your
pa
behind
and
you
going
away
from
him
to
stay
a
year
you
got
to
go
you
ca
help
yourself
so
you
might
just
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
and
be
cheerful
instead
of
miserable
so
now
that
settled
and
you
better
get
out
your
books
and
games
or
whatever
you
brought
along
to
amuse
yourself
with
miss
powers
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
gloves
and
arranged
a
small
balsam
pillow
behind
her
head
she
put
on
her
glasses
and
opened
a
book
in
which
she
at
once
became
absorbed
patty
being
thus
left
to
her
own
devices
became
much
interested
in
the
novelty
of
her
surroundings
it
was
great
fun
to
lean
back
against
the
seat
and
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
trees
and
plantations
and
towns
as
they
flew
by
this
kept
her
amused
until
noontime
when
a
waiter
came
through
the
car
banging
a
gong
miss
powers
shut
her
book
with
a
snap
and
announced
that
they
would
go
to
the
for
their
lunch
this
was
even
more
fun
for
it
seemed
so
queer
to
patty
to
sit
at
a
table
and
eat
while
at
the
same
time
she
was
flying
through
the
country
at
such
speed
it
like
the
enchanted
carpet
is
it
miss
powers
she
said
as
they
slid
through
a
thick
grove
and
then
out
into
the
sunshine
again
what
is
what
carpet
asked
miss
powers
looking
down
at
the
floor
of
the
car
oh
not
a
real
carpet
said
patty
politely
repressing
a
smile
at
the
elder
lady
ignorance
of
i
mean
for
us
to
go
scooting
along
so
fast
is
like
the
travelers
on
the
magicians
carpet
do
you
know
the
carpet
would
move
of
itself
wherever
he
told
it
to
h
commented
miss
powers
that
would
be
a
good
kind
of
a
carpet
to
have
at
housecleaning
time
would
it
this
prosaic
disposition
of
the
magic
carpet
quite
shocked
patty
but
she
adapted
herself
to
the
idea
and
said
yes
indeed
you
could
just
say
get
up
and
go
out
and
hang
yourself
on
the
and
then
shake
yourself
well
and
come
back
again
oh
that
would
be
convenient
miss
powers
smiled
in
an
sort
of
way
and
patty
chattered
on
half
to
herself
and
half
to
her
companion
but
suppose
the
carpet
should
be
naughty
and
refuse
to
go
that
be
so
pleasant
or
suppose
it
should
run
away
and
never
come
back
this
latter
remark
was
made
by
a
strange
voice
and
patty
looked
up
quickly
to
see
the
man
who
was
seated
opposite
smiling
in
a
very
friendly
way
he
was
an
elderly
gentleman
with
white
hair
and
beard
and
it
seemed
to
patty
vivid
imagination
that
he
looked
like
noah
or
some
other
of
the
ancient
patriarchs
that
would
be
a
great
joke
on
the
housekeeper
patty
answered
feeling
already
well
acquainted
with
the
pleasant
old
gentleman
and
i
suppose
she
would
have
to
get
a
new
carpet
or
have
a
floor
laid
in
her
room
he
responded
or
live
on
a
bare
floor
said
miss
powers
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
slack
housekeeper
who
would
let
her
carpets
shake
themselves
and
she
would
probably
be
too
lazy
or
too
poor
to
replace
the
ones
that
ran
away
noah
as
patty
called
the
old
man
in
her
mind
laughed
heartily
at
this
and
during
the
rest
of
the
luncheon
hour
proved
himself
a
genial
and
entertaining
companion
the
day
passed
quickly
and
at
bedtime
patty
was
quite
tired
enough
to
welcome
the
thought
of
tucking
herself
away
in
one
of
those
bunks
that
the
porter
was
arranging
i
sleep
on
the
top
shelf
she
said
gleefully
may
i
miss
powers
i
be
very
glad
if
you
will
child
i
no
desire
to
climb
up
there
ugh
i
do
think
i
can
sleep
anywhere
on
this
train
then
the
porter
brought
a
small
and
this
delighted
patty
beyond
measure
ho
said
she
now
i
and
the
beanstalk
i
go
and
with
two
jumps
and
a
spring
she
landed
in
the
upper
berth
now
she
said
to
herself
i
know
how
alice
felt
when
she
grew
so
large
that
she
filled
up
the
whole
room
let
me
see
what
did
she
do
she
put
one
arm
out
the
window
and
one
foot
up
the
chimney
well
i
ca
do
that
and
i
do
see
any
little
cakes
to
eat
as
she
did
that
will
make
me
grow
smaller
so
i
i
just
have
to
scrounch
around
till
i
ready
for
bed
and
then
slide
in
i
sure
i
sha
sleep
it
all
so
noisy
and
exciting
but
when
she
finally
straightened
herself
out
on
the
coarse
linen
of
the
pullman
the
of
the
train
changed
to
a
lullaby
and
in
about
two
minutes
patty
was
sound
asleep
chapter
iii
new
friends
it
was
about
four
the
next
afternoon
when
the
train
came
puffing
into
the
great
in
jersey
city
it
had
passed
through
elmbridge
about
an
hour
before
but
being
an
express
train
it
made
no
stop
at
such
small
places
so
clair
had
arranged
to
meet
patty
at
jersey
city
and
take
her
back
home
with
him
patty
recognized
her
uncle
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
car
and
ran
to
greet
him
howdy
uncle
robert
she
said
in
her
pretty
southern
way
are
you
looking
for
me
i
am
if
you
little
patty
fairfield
but
you
grown
so
since
i
saw
you
that
i
think
i
shall
have
to
ask
for
your
credentials
patty
laughed
and
answered
my
credentials
are
that
i
remember
the
doll
and
the
candy
you
brought
me
five
years
ago
and
i
just
you
my
uncle
robert
i
am
indeed
and
i
come
to
carry
you
off
to
a
lot
of
other
admiring
relatives
then
patty
introduced
miss
powers
and
after
gathering
up
the
various
wraps
and
bags
they
all
left
the
train
miss
powers
was
to
cross
the
ferry
to
new
york
so
patty
and
uncle
robert
escorted
her
to
the
and
bade
her
with
many
thanks
for
her
kind
care
of
the
little
girl
during
the
journey
then
uncle
robert
said
now
we
go
out
to
elmbridge
as
quick
as
we
can
skip
but
first
we
must
pick
up
ethelyn
whom
i
left
in
the
oh
is
ethelyn
here
cried
patty
i
am
so
glad
i
just
crazy
to
see
her
apparently
ethelyn
was
crazy
too
for
she
flew
at
her
cousin
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
door
you
dear
thing
she
exclaimed
i
so
delighted
to
see
you
oh
how
pretty
you
are
we
be
awfully
good
chums
wo
we
i
sure
we
shall
replied
patty
who
was
just
a
wee
bit
frightened
by
this
dashing
young
cousin
ethelyn
was
about
patty
age
but
somewhat
shorter
and
decidedly
less
slender
her
yellow
hair
was
not
long
indeed
it
was
cut
evenly
round
just
above
her
shoulders
but
it
was
crinkled
and
fluffed
out
until
her
head
had
the
contour
of
a
yellow
pumpkin
a
huge
black
hat
with
a
wide
rolling
brim
was
perched
on
top
of
the
yellow
mop
and
ornamented
with
feathers
and
shining
buckles
both
the
girls
wore
dark
blue
suits
trimmed
with
fur
but
ethelyn
was
resplendent
with
wide
collars
and
she
wore
clattering
bangles
on
her
wrists
and
a
fancy
little
muff
hung
round
her
neck
by
a
silver
chain
her
skirts
were
as
short
as
patty
and
she
seemed
like
a
little
girl
and
yet
she
had
a
wise
air
and
she
began
to
patronize
her
cousin
at
once
your
frock
is
nice
she
said
but
it
has
no
style
to
it
well
i
suppose
you
could
get
much
in
the
way
of
dressmakers
where
you
lived
but
madame
marsala
will
soon
turn
you
out
all
right
mamma
says
she
just
enjoy
ordering
new
clothes
for
you
and
your
papa
told
her
to
get
whatever
she
chose
oh
wo
we
have
fun
we
always
go
to
new
york
for
our
things
and
the
shops
are
just
lovely
come
come
children
said
uncle
robert
who
had
been
looking
after
patty
trunks
the
train
is
made
up
let
us
get
aboard
they
went
through
one
of
a
whole
row
of
little
gates
in
an
iron
fence
and
patty
wondered
at
the
numerous
trains
and
the
crowds
of
people
moving
swiftly
towards
them
she
wondered
if
everything
at
the
north
were
conducted
on
such
a
wholesale
and
such
a
hurrying
plan
they
hurried
along
the
platform
and
hurried
into
a
car
then
uncle
robert
put
the
two
children
into
a
seat
together
while
he
sat
behind
them
and
devoted
himself
to
his
evening
paper
the
girls
chatted
gaily
and
patty
learned
much
about
the
home
she
was
going
to
and
began
to
think
of
it
as
a
very
beautiful
and
attractive
place
the
train
stopped
at
elmbridge
and
without
waiting
for
her
father
ethelyn
piloted
patty
off
the
car
here
our
carriage
she
said
as
a
handsome
pair
of
horses
with
jingling
chains
came
prancing
up
a
footman
in
livery
handed
the
young
ladies
in
and
patty
felt
as
if
she
had
come
among
very
grand
people
indeed
while
they
waited
for
clair
who
was
giving
the
checks
to
the
patty
admired
the
pretty
little
station
of
rough
gray
stone
and
the
neatly
kept
grounds
and
paths
all
about
it
yes
they
are
pretty
assented
ethelyn
but
just
wait
till
you
see
our
grounds
we
have
the
finest
place
in
elmbridge
in
summer
it
just
lovely
then
clair
came
and
giving
the
coachman
the
order
home
he
seated
himself
opposite
the
two
girls
well
patty
how
do
you
like
it
so
far
he
asked
genially
of
his
niece
oh
uncle
robert
i
think
it
beautiful
but
i
hoped
we
have
a
i
never
been
in
a
sleigh
bless
you
child
we
do
have
much
sleighing
however
perhaps
we
can
scare
up
a
before
the
winter
is
over
we
have
a
pretty
fine
sleigh
eh
ethelyn
yes
indeed
we
have
a
beautiful
great
big
one
and
i
have
a
little
cutter
all
my
own
i
take
you
sleighing
patty
if
we
get
half
a
chance
soon
they
reached
the
clair
home
and
drove
up
the
long
winding
avenue
to
the
house
patty
saw
a
brilliantly
lighted
mansion
and
as
they
drew
near
it
she
heard
the
most
piercing
shrieks
and
yells
as
of
a
human
being
in
desperate
straits
of
some
kind
patty
wondered
if
she
were
about
to
enter
a
bluebeard
castle
but
deeming
it
polite
to
take
no
notice
of
the
uproar
she
tried
to
appear
unheeding
though
the
shrieks
increased
in
violence
as
they
came
up
to
the
house
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
front
door
chapter
iv
villa
rosa
here
we
are
chickens
said
uncle
robert
as
the
footman
threw
open
the
carriage
door
here
your
new
home
patty
and
you
very
welcome
to
your
uncle
robert
house
it
was
almost
dark
and
patty
could
distinguish
only
the
outlines
of
a
magnificent
house
so
large
that
it
seemed
like
a
palace
they
went
up
massive
stone
steps
between
great
stone
lions
to
a
wonderful
veranda
bright
with
electric
lights
and
lights
streamed
from
every
window
and
from
the
wide
front
doors
which
flew
open
as
they
reached
them
but
though
all
this
beauty
and
elegance
impressed
patty
like
a
dream
of
fairyland
she
paid
little
heed
to
it
for
she
was
so
shocked
and
disturbed
by
the
shrieks
from
within
which
were
now
distinctly
audible
as
those
of
a
child
goodness
me
exclaimed
ethelyn
just
as
patty
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
was
about
to
ask
what
it
meant
what
can
be
the
matter
with
florelle
this
time
i
hope
you
enjoy
squealing
patty
for
you
hear
plenty
of
it
in
this
house
do
mind
it
little
sister
has
a
fearful
temper
and
we
have
to
let
her
squeal
it
out
patty
was
relieved
to
learn
that
it
was
a
case
of
intentional
torture
and
by
this
time
she
found
herself
in
the
great
hall
the
grandeur
of
her
surroundings
fairly
dazzled
her
for
patty
was
an
inexperienced
little
girl
and
had
lived
simply
though
very
comfortably
all
her
life
and
so
she
looked
with
amazement
on
the
walls
frescoed
in
brilliant
colors
the
enormous
mirrors
the
tall
palms
and
marble
statues
the
rich
draperies
and
windows
if
she
had
been
older
and
more
experienced
she
would
have
known
that
it
was
gorgeous
the
coloring
too
bright
and
garish
and
the
ornamentation
but
to
her
childish
eyes
it
all
seemed
wonderfully
fine
oh
uncle
robert
she
cried
is
this
your
home
how
beautiful
it
is
i
never
saw
such
a
lovely
place
in
my
life
this
speech
pleased
clair
beyond
measure
for
he
dearly
loved
to
have
his
beautiful
home
appreciated
and
he
beamed
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
a
general
air
of
satisfaction
yes
yes
he
said
it
is
fine
there
is
another
such
place
for
miles
around
then
they
went
into
the
and
patty
was
presented
to
her
aunt
isabel
clair
was
a
fair
large
woman
with
golden
hair
elaborately
frizzed
and
kind
blue
eyes
she
was
fashionably
dressed
and
her
silks
rustled
and
her
bugles
tinkled
as
she
came
forward
to
meet
her
visitor
i
am
charmed
to
see
you
patty
my
dear
she
said
kissing
her
affectionately
and
i
am
very
glad
to
be
here
aunt
isabel
said
patty
and
just
then
she
was
interrupted
by
the
violent
entrance
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
pink
cyclone
this
was
the
eight
year
old
florelle
and
without
a
doubt
it
was
she
who
was
responsible
for
the
shrieks
patty
had
heard
the
child
wore
a
short
beruffled
dress
of
pink
silk
a
huge
pink
sash
and
pink
stockings
and
slippers
her
eyes
were
reddened
with
crying
and
her
cheeks
were
and
she
ran
to
patty
screaming
i
will
i
she
cousin
and
i
going
to
see
her
then
she
threw
her
arms
round
patty
waist
and
smiled
up
into
her
face
she
was
a
very
pretty
little
girl
when
she
smiled
and
patty
could
help
admiring
her
though
so
far
she
had
seemed
like
anything
but
a
lovable
character
oh
florelle
said
her
mother
mildly
how
naughty
you
are
i
told
you
to
go
to
bed
like
a
goody
girl
and
you
should
see
cousin
patty
in
the
morning
but
i
wanted
to
see
her
so
i
made
nurse
dress
me
and
i
going
to
stay
up
to
dinner
let
her
stay
mamma
said
ethelyn
if
you
do
she
yell
again
and
i
tired
of
hearing
her
yes
you
can
stay
baby
said
clair
and
now
ethelyn
take
patty
to
her
room
and
get
yourselves
ready
for
dinner
the
two
girls
went
off
together
and
patty
discovered
that
the
rest
of
the
house
was
as
sumptuous
as
her
first
view
of
it
the
same
brilliant
coloring
and
florid
ornamentation
appeared
everywhere
and
when
at
last
ethelyn
stopped
before
an
open
door
and
said
this
is
your
room
patty
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
for
she
entered
what
seemed
a
veritable
fairy
bower
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
tinted
pink
and
frescoed
with
garlands
of
roses
and
flying
birds
there
was
a
fascinating
bay
window
with
latticed
panes
and
a
cozy
with
soft
cushions
the
brass
bedstead
had
a
lace
coverlet
over
pink
silk
and
the
had
frilled
curtains
and
pink
ribbons
there
were
brushes
and
bottles
and
knickknacks
of
all
kinds
the
little
was
a
gem
and
there
was
a
lovely
with
silver
appointments
and
pink
then
there
was
a
cozy
divan
with
lots
of
fluffy
pink
pillows
and
through
a
door
patty
could
see
a
dear
little
there
were
beautiful
pictures
on
the
walls
and
costly
vases
and
all
about
and
it
all
showed
such
kind
thought
on
the
part
of
somebody
that
patty
heart
was
touched
is
it
for
me
who
did
it
all
she
asked
turning
to
ethelyn
with
shining
eyes
oh
mamma
did
it
she
loves
to
do
such
things
that
is
she
planned
it
and
the
servants
did
the
work
here
my
room
right
next
it
just
like
it
almost
so
it
was
or
at
least
it
had
been
but
it
showed
signs
of
carelessness
and
disorder
a
lamp
globe
was
broken
and
there
was
a
large
hole
burned
in
one
of
the
pretty
rugs
the
toilet
table
too
was
in
sad
disarray
and
some
papers
were
sticking
out
of
the
closed
desk
do
look
at
it
said
ethelyn
apologetically
i
so
careless
i
broke
that
globe
when
i
was
swinging
my
and
i
done
it
so
often
that
mamma
declared
she
would
get
me
another
and
i
upset
the
alcohol
lamp
on
the
rug
but
i
do
care
when
we
have
a
party

will
all
get
spruced
up

ethelyn
was
already
kneeling
before
patty
open
trunk
and
overhauling
her
belongings
oh

a
blue
crape
she
cried
you
must
look

on
why
that
my
best
ethelyn
never
mind
wear
it
and
mamma
get
you
some
new
party
clothes
so
patty
put
on
the
blue
crape
and
very
becoming
it
was
though
somewhat
inappropriate
for
a
quiet
family
dinner
we
only
have
one
maid
between
us
explained
ethelyn
calling
from
her
own
room
into
patty
elise
will
do
your
hair
when
you
want
her
but
just
now
she
doing
mine
to
patty
surprise
when
she
saw
ethelyn
again
she
was
arrayed
in
a
light
green
silk
dress
and
her
hair
was
puffed
high
on
her
head
patty
wore
hers
as
usual
and
felt
as
if
her
cousin
had
suddenly
grown
up
away
from
her
does
my
hair
look
nice
asked
ethelyn
as
the
girls
went
together
mamma
says
i
too
young
to
have
it
done
up
this
way
yet
but
i
do
care
what
she
says
i
fifteen
and
i
think
i
old
enough
to
do
as
i
choose
we
make
elise
do
yours
up
and
see
how
you
look
but
i
only
fourteen
protested
patty
and
i
do
want
to
be
grown
up
for
years
yet
your
hair
looks
lovely
but
i
like
you
better
with
it
down
as
it
was
this
afternoon
do
say
so
before
mamma
or
shell
insist
on
my
wearing
it
so
when
the
girls
entered
the
clair
smiled
amiably
at
her
pretty
niece
and
bade
her
come
to
her
side
my
dear
she
said
you
are
a
pretty
little
girl
and
a
sweet
one
no
doubt
but
your
name
i
do
not
like
at
all
i
ca
abide
nicknames
so
i
going
to
call
you
by
your
full
name
what
is
it
martha
martha
exclaimed
patty
in
surprise
oh
no
aunt
isabel
i
was
named
for
my
my
name
is
patricia
oh
how
lovely
cried
aunt
isabel
kissing
her
niece
in
the
exuberance
of
her
delight
we
will
all
call
you
patricia
it
is
a
beautiful
name
and
suits
you
extremely
well
you
must
stand
very
straight
and
acquire
dignified
manners
in
order
to
live
up
to
it
this
made
merry
patty
laugh
but
she
offered
no
objection
to
her
decision
and
promised
to
sign
her
name
patricia
whenever
she
wrote
it
and
to
make
no
further
use
of
the
despised
nickname
while
staying
at
villa
rosa
ethelyn
was
pleased
too
at
the
change
oh
she
said
now
your
name
is
as
pretty
as
mine
and
florelle
and
we
have
the
prettiest
names
in
elmbridge
here
comes
reginald
you
seen
him
yet
reginald
clair
a
lad
of
thirteen
advanced
without
a
trace
of
shyness
and
greeted
his
new
cousin
so
it
is
patricia
he
said
as
he
took
her
hand
i
heard
them
rechristening
you
how
do
you
do
cousin
patricia
very
well
i
thank
you
she
replied
smiling
and
though
i
meet
you
the
last
of
my
new
cousins
you
are
not
the
least
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
for
reginald
was
a
tall
boy
for
his
age
taller
than
either
ethelyn
or
patty
not
the
least
in
any
way
as
you
soon
find
out
if
you
stay
with
us
cousin
patricia
patty
almost
laughed
at
this
boastful
assumption
of
importance
but
seeing
that
the
boy
was
in
earnest
she
humored
him
by
saying
as
the
only
son
i
suppose
you
the
flower
of
the
family
then
dinner
was
announced
and
the
beautiful
was
a
new
pleasure
to
the
little
visitor
she
was
rapidly
making
the
discovery
that
riches
and
luxury
were
very
agreeable
and
she
viewed
with
delight
the
handsome
table
sparkling
with
fine
glass
and
silver
well
patricia
said
uncle
robert
who
had
been
warned
against
using
the
objectionable
nickname
how
do
you
like
villa
rosa
so
far
oh
i
think
it
is
beautiful
uncle
robert
every
room
is
handsomer
than
the
last
and
my
own
room
i
like
best
of
all
you
awfully
good
aunt
isabel
to
give
me
such
a
lovely
room
and
to
spend
so
much
thought
and
time
arranging
it
for
me
and
money
too
said
her
aunt
smiling
that
rug
in
your
room
patricia
cost
four
hundred
dollars
did
it
really
said
patty
with
such
a
look
of
amazement
almost
horror
that
they
all
laughed
you
see
patty
had
never
been
used
to
such
expensive
rugs
still
less
had
she
been
accustomed
to
hearing
the
prices
of
things
mentioned
so
freely
oh
aunt
isabel
i
rather
not
have
it
then
really
i
much
rather
have
a
cheaper
one
suppose
i
should
spoil
it
in
some
way
nonsense
my
dear
spoil
it
if
you
like
i
buy
you
another
said
uncle
robert
grandly
never
mind
rugs
interrupted
reginald
i
say
mother
are
you
going
to
give
a
party
for
patricia
yes
i
think
so
answered
his
mother
but
i
have
decided
yet
what
kind
of
an
affair
it
shall
be
oh
have
a
smashing
big
party
and
invite
everybody
no
reginald
said
ethelyn
i
hate
those
big
parties
they
no
fun
at
all
it
is
going
to
be
a
party
anyway
it
going
to
be
a
tea
you
say
so
mamma
a
tea
is
a
much
nicer
way
to
introduce
patricia
than
a
party
ho
ho
laughed
her
brother
a
tea
why
they
the
most
stupid
things
in
the
world
nobody
wants
to
come
to
a
tea
they
do
so
retorted
ethelyn
you
do
know
anything
about
society
teas
are
ever
so
much
stylisher
than
evening
entertainments
are
they
mamma
well
i
do
know
said
clair
doubtfully
the
crandons
gave
a
tea
when
their
cousin
visited
them
ho
the
crandons
sneered
ethelyn
they
nobody
at
all
why
only
got
one
horse
i
know
it
said
her
mother
but
they
awfully
exclusive
they
speak
to
hardly
anybody
then
do
speak
to
them
said
clair
i
just
guess
we
as
good
as
the
crandons
any
day
in
the
week
i
do
know
as
you
better
invite
them
my
dear
they
would
come
if
you
did
said
reginald
they
would
so
snapped
ethelyn
they
jump
at
the
chance
i
bet
they
would
i
bet
they
would
you
do
know
everything
in
the
world
neither
do
you
hush
children
said
clair
mildly
your
cousin
patricia
will
think
you
very
rude
and
unmannerly
if
you
quarrel
so
florelle
is
the
only
one
who
is
behaving
nicely
are
you
darling
florelle
beamed
at
this
and
looked
like
a
little
cherub
until
reginald
slyly
took
a
cake
from
her
plate
screamed
florelle
bursting
into
tears
he
took
my
cakie
he
did
give
it
to
me
and
she
began
pounding
her
brother
with
her
small
fists
but
reginald
had
eaten
it
and
no
other
cake
on
the
plate
would
pacify
the
angry
child
no
no
she
cried
i
want
that
same
one
it
had
a
green
nut
on
it
and
i
it
but
brother
ca
give
it
to
you
baby
he
eaten
it
said
her
father
vainly
trying
to
console
her
with
other
dainties
but
florelle
continued
to
scream
and
st
clair
was
obliged
to
summon
the
nurse
and
have
her
taken
well
that
a
relief
said
ethelyn
as
the
struggling
child
was
carried
away
i
told
you
you
hear
her
yell
pretty
often
patricia
patty
felt
rather
embarrassed
and
did
know
what
to
say
she
was
beginning
to
think
villa
rosa
had
some
thorns
as
well
as
roses
after
dinner
as
they
sat
round
the
great
fireplace
in
the
library
clair
announced
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
will
give
a
tea
for
patricia
in
order
that
she
may
be
properly
introduced
to
the
elmbridge
people
the
best
of
them
and
then
later
we
will
have
a
large
party
for
her
this
pleased
everybody
and
amiability
was
restored
and
all
fell
to
making
plans
for
the
future
pleasures
of
their
guest
when
patty
went
to
her
room
that
night
she
was
so
tired
out
with
the
excitements
of
the
day
that
she
was
glad
to
go
to
rest
but
first
of
all
she
opened
the
little
box
that
her
father
had
given
her
at
parting
was
it
possible
that
she
had
left
her
father
only
the
day
before
already
it
seemed
like
weeks
with
eager
fingers
she
broke
the
seals
and
tore
off
the
paper
wrappings
and
found
to
her
great
delight
an
ivory
miniature
of
her
mother
she
had
seen
the
picture
often
it
had
been
one
of
her
father
chief
treasures
and
she
prized
it
the
more
highly
as
she
thought
what
a
sacrifice
it
must
have
been
for
him
to
give
it
up
even
to
his
child
it
was
in
a
florentine
gold
frame
and
patty
placed
it
in
the
centre
of
her
and
then
sat
down
and
gazed
earnestly
at
it
she
saw
a
sweet
girlish
face
which
was
very
like
her
own
though
she
did
recognize
the
resemblance
dear
mother
she
said
softly
i
will
try
to
be
just
such
a
little
girl
as
you
would
have
wished
me
to
be
if
you
had
lived
to
love
me
chapter
v
a
minuet
mamma
said
ethelyn
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
i
going
to
take
a
holiday
from
lessons
because
patricia
has
just
come
and
she
does
want
to
begin
to
study
right
away
indeed
miss
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
replied
her
mother
you
had
a
holiday
yesterday
because
patricia
was
coming
and
one
the
day
before
on
account
of
mabel
miller
tea
and
you
had
holiday
all
last
week
because
of
the
fancy
bazaar
when
do
you
expect
to
learn
anything
well
i
do
care
said
ethelyn
tossing
her
head
i
going
to
stay
with
patricia
anyhow
if
she
goes
to
the
schoolroom
i
will
and
if
she
do
i
wo
oh
i
go
to
school
with
you
ethelyn
said
patty
anxious
to
please
both
her
aunt
and
cousin
if
possible
but
clair
said
no
indeed
patricia
you
do
want
to
begin
lessons
yet
why
you
scarcely
rested
from
your
journey
i
am
going
to
new
york
to
buy
you
some
new
dresses
and
if
you
not
too
tired
you
may
go
with
me
and
help
select
them
well
i
just
guess
patricia
wo
go
to
new
york
unless
i
go
too
cried
ethelyn
in
great
excitement
do
you
think
i
stay
at
home
and
grub
in
the
schoolroom
while
she
having
a
good
time
in
the
city
not
much
my
mary
anne
ethelyn
said
her
mother
reprovingly
how
many
times
must
i
tell
you
not
to
use
slang
it
is
vulgar
and
unladylike
and
quite
out
of
keeping
with
your
social
position
i
do
care
it
expressive
if
it
is
stylish
do
say
stylish
either
that
is
genteel
at
all
say
oh
well
mother
i
guess
it
must
be
correct
to
use
slang
gladys
mahoney
does
and
she
a
hummer
on
style
and
i
no
doubt
her
mother
reproves
her
for
it
just
as
i
do
you
now
go
to
the
schoolroom
it
is
nearly
ten
i
wo
go
unless
patricia
comes
too
if
she
going
to
new
york
with
you
i
going
ethelyn
said
clair
sternly
do
as
i
bid
you
go
to
the
schoolroom
at
once
and
study
your
lessons
diligently
no
i
wo
replied
ethelyn
stubbornly
i
wo
stir
a
step
unless
patty
comes
too
but
i
going
to
take
patricia
to
new
york
then
i
going
to
new
york
said
ethelyn
with
an
air
of
settling
the
question
and
then
she
began
drumming
on
the
table
with
her
fingers
i
want
to
go
to
new
york
with
you
mamma
said
florelle
i
want
to
buy
a
new
dolly
no
baby
said
her
mother
you
ca
go
this
time
you
stay
at
home
like
a
good
girlie
and
i
bring
you
a
beautiful
new
doll
but
i
to
go
i
go
and
florelle
began
to
cry
stop
that
crying
said
her
father
stop
it
at
once
and
when
i
come
home
i
bring
you
a
big
box
of
candy
no
i
do
want
candy
i
want
to
go
to
new
york
i
want
to
go
i
she
wound
up
with
a
prolonged
wail
good
gracious
florelle
said
reginald
do
stop
that
fearful
yowling
if
you
do
as
soon
as
i
go
down
town
i
send
a
bear
back
here
to
eat
you
up
at
this
florelle
screamed
louder
than
ever
and
had
to
be
taken
away
from
the
table
patty
felt
quite
helpless
in
the
midst
of
this
commotion
she
had
been
accustomed
to
obey
willingly
her
father
lightest
wish
and
impertinence
amazed
her
as
for
little
florelle
she
thought
the
child
was
quite
old
enough
to
be
reasoned
with
and
taught
not
to
cry
so
violently
over
every
trifle
but
she
realized
it
was
not
her
place
to
criticise
her
cousins
behavior
so
she
did
the
best
she
could
to
pour
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
aunt
isabel
she
said
if
you
do
mind
i
stay
at
home
and
study
with
ethelyn
well
do
as
you
like
child
said
her
aunt
carelessly
of
course
i
can
select
your
clothes
just
as
well
without
you
and
i
take
you
both
to
new
york
some
saturday
but
you
need
study
unless
you
choose
you
know
well
i
stay
with
ethelyn
anyway
said
patty
tucking
her
arm
through
her
cousin
as
they
went
off
to
the
schoolroom
what
a
mean
old
thing
you
are
said
ethelyn
crossly
you
might
just
as
well
have
said
you
go
to
new
york
and
then
i
would
have
gone
too
and
we
could
have
had
a
lovely
time
shopping
and
lunching
at
delmonico
and
perhaps
going
to
a
matinée
but
your
mother
said
you
could
go
said
patty
in
surprise
oh
that
nothing
i
would
have
gone
all
the
same
and
now
you
spoiled
it
all
and
we
got
to
drudge
over
our
books
here
the
schoolroom
miss
morton
this
is
my
cousin
patricia
fairfield
she
is
to
begin
lessons
while
ethelyn
was
talking
the
girls
had
mounted
to
the
third
floor
of
the
great
house
and
entered
the
large
and
schoolroom
miss
morton
was
a
young
woman
who
greeted
ethelyn
pleasantly
and
then
turned
cordially
to
the
stranger
we
are
glad
to
have
you
with
us
she
said
you
may
sit
here
at
this
desk
and
presently
i
will
ask
you
some
questions
about
your
studies
reginald
was
already
in
his
place
and
was
studying
away
for
dear
life
he
was
naturally
a
studious
boy
and
he
was
anxious
to
prepare
himself
to
enter
a
certain
school
the
next
year
but
ethelyn
had
no
taste
for
study
and
she
flounced
herself
into
her
chair
and
unwillingly
took
up
her
books
now
ethelyn
said
miss
morton
you
must
learn
that
history
lesson
you
dawdled
over
it
so
long
that
it
has
become
a
real
bug
bear
to
you
but
i
sure
if
you
determine
to
conquer
it
you
can
easily
do
so
just
try
it
ho
called
out
reginald
teasingly
ca
learn
a
history
lesson
i
could
wait
for
you
so
i
went
on
ahead
i
over
to
the
of
the
german
empire
where
are
you
in
history
patricia
i
only
studied
united
states
history
she
replied
a
little
ashamed
of
her
small
attainments
but
i
been
through
that
twice
well
said
miss
morton
kindly
it
better
to
know
one
thing
thoroughly
than
to
have
smatterings
of
a
great
many
if
you
are
familiar
with
united
states
history
you
will
enjoy
lessons
in
the
history
of
other
countries
for
a
change
i
sure
i
shall
said
patty
and
my
father
told
me
to
study
whatever
you
thought
best
for
me
but
i
do
like
to
study
very
much
i
rather
read
story
books
miss
morton
examined
patty
in
arithmetic
geography
and
some
other
branches
and
decided
that
as
her
attainments
in
knowledge
were
about
equal
to
those
of
her
cousins
they
might
all
have
the
same
lessons
each
day
patty
afterwards
discovered
that
reginald
learned
these
lessons
and
ethelyn
did
not
but
she
simply
skipped
them
and
went
on
to
the
next
apparently
making
the
same
progress
as
her
brother
patty
had
become
absorbed
in
her
history
lesson
which
was
very
interesting
when
ethelyn
began
to
chatter
miss
morton
she
said
we
are
going
to
have
a
party
for
my
cousin
are
you
that
will
be
very
nice
but
do
let
us
discuss
it
now
for
i
want
you
to
put
your
whole
attention
on
that
history
lesson
i
will
but
miss
morton
it
going
to
be
a
very
grand
party
everybody
in
elmbridge
will
be
invited
i
mean
she
added
tossing
her
head
everybody
that
anybody
everybody
is
somebody
said
reginald
without
looking
up
from
his
book
and
i
wish
you
keep
still
ethelyn
well
you
know
what
i
mean
everybody
that
rich
and
important
and
fit
for
us
to
know
why
said
patty
looking
at
her
cousin
in
surprise
are
people
fit
for
you
to
know
unless
they
rich
no
said
ethelyn
i
would
associate
with
people
unless
they
were
rich
and
neither
would
you
patricia
yes
i
would
said
patty
stoutly
if
they
were
good
and
wise
and
refined
and
they
often
are
well
you
ca
associate
with
them
while
you
living
with
us
anyhow
we
only
go
with
the
swells
ethelyn
said
miss
morton
gently
that
is
the
right
way
to
talk
i
think
oh
never
mind
what
you
think
said
ethelyn
rudely
you
know
the
last
time
you
preached
to
me
i
nearly
made
mamma
discharge
you
and
i
do
it
for
sure
if
you
try
it
again
miss
morton
bit
her
lip
and
said
nothing
for
she
was
a
poor
girl
and
had
no
wish
to
lose
her
lucrative
position
in
the
clair
household
though
her
ideas
were
widely
at
variance
with
those
of
her
employers
but
sense
of
justice
was
roused
oh
ethelyn
she
said
how
can
you
speak
to
your
teacher
so
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
oh
miss
morton
do
mind
do
you
said
ethelyn
who
was
really
only
careless
and
had
no
wish
to
be
unkind
and
it
true
i
will
have
her
sent
away
if
she
preaches
at
us
i
hate
it
but
she
wo
preach
any
more
will
you
morty
and
ethelyn
smiled
at
her
governess
in
a
wheedlesome
way
go
on
with
your
lessons
said
miss
morton
in
a
quiet
tone
though
she
was
with
difficulty
repressing
a
desire
to
tell
her
pupil
what
she
thought
of
her
yes
do
growled
reginald
how
can
a
fellow
study
when
you
chattering
away
with
your
shrill
voice
i
have
got
a
shrill
voice
retorted
ethelyn
have
i
patricia
mamma
says
a
soft
low
voice
is
very
stylish
correct
i
mean
and
i
sure
mine
is
low
and
soft
ethelyn
said
this
in
such
an
affected
whisper
that
patty
had
to
smile
but
reginald
said
pooh
of
course
you
have
when
you
put
on
airs
like
that
but
naturally
your
voice
is
a
cross
between
a
locomotive
whistle
and
scratching
on
a
slate
it
is
it
is
well
yours
is
a
bit
better
anyway
i
did
say
it
was
did
i
i
did
say
you
did
say
so
did
i
i
did
say
you
said
i
said
so
did
i
i
did
say
you
said
i
said
you
said
children
stop
quarreling
said
miss
morton
half
laughing
at
the
angry
combatants
whose
flushed
faces
showed
signs
of
coming
tears
but
patty
laughed
outright
what
sillies
you
are
she
said
to
squabble
so
over
nothing
when
school
was
over
it
was
time
for
luncheon
and
after
that
ethelyn
told
patty
that
it
was
the
afternoon
for
and
they
were
all
to
go
you
must
wear
your
blue
crape
patricia
she
said
and
make
yourself
look
as
pretty
as
you
can
and
put
on
all
your
jewelry
but
i
have
any
jewelry
said
patty
papa
says
little
girls
to
wear
any
no
jewelry
why
how
funny
i
have
loads
of
it
well
no
matter
i
lend
you
some
of
mine
or
we
crib
some
out
of
mamma
i
know
where
she
hides
the
key
thank
you
ethelyn
but
i
would
wear
borrowed
ornaments
and
i
want
to
wear
jewelry
anyway
i
not
old
enough
oh
you
are
too
what
silly
notions
you
have
and
besides
while
you
with
us
mamma
said
you
must
do
whatever
we
want
you
to
so
patty
reluctantly
allowed
ethelyn
to
clasp
a
necklace
round
her
throat
and
slip
several
jingling
bangles
on
her
wrists
there
said
ethelyn
adding
an
emerald
brooch
which
she
had
selected
from
her
mother
collection
now
you
do
look
like
a
pauper
anyhow
but
i
do
feel
comfortable
ethelyn
and
besides
suppose
i
should
lose
these
things
oh
you
wo
lose
them
and
if
you
should
i
do
believe
mamma
would
scold
much
she
like
it
better
than
if
i
let
you
go
looking
like
a
nobody
and
have
the
mahoneys
think
our
cousin
was
poor
ethelyn
herself
was
resplendent
in
red
silk
trimmed
with
spangled
lace
she
wore
shining
slippers
with
high
french
heels
and
all
the
jewelry
she
could
cram
on
to
her
small
person
florelle
looked
like
a
fairy
in
a
short
little
white
frock
all
fine
muslin
and
lace
with
ruffles
and
frills
that
stood
out
in
every
direction
the
overdressed
little
midget
was
delighted
with
her
appearance
and
pranced
around
in
front
of
the
mirror
admiring
herself
reginald
too
considered
himself
very
fine
in
his
black
velvet
suit
with
a
great
white
collar
and
immense
white
silk
tie
miss
morton
accompanied
the
children
and
the
clair
carriage
carried
them
away
to
the
dancing
class
when
they
arrived
all
was
bustle
and
excitement
about
forty
gaily
dressed
children
were
assembled
in
a
large
hall
prettily
decorated
with
flags
and
flowers
patty
was
fond
of
dancing
and
danced
very
gracefully
in
her
slow
southern
way
but
she
was
utterly
unfamiliar
with
the
mincing
steps
and
elaborate
contortions
attempted
by
the
elmbridge
young
people
however
she
enjoyed
it
all
from
its
very
novelty
and
she
was
pleasantly
impressed
with
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
to
whom
she
was
introduced
but
she
was
amazed
and
almost
angry
at
the
way
her
cousin
talked
about
her
mabel
said
ethelyn
as
she
presented
patty
to
mabel
miller
this
is
my
cousin
patricia
fairfield
she
is
from
richmond
virginia
and
is
visiting
us
for
the
winter
her
father
is
a
millionaire
and
he
has
lots
of
great
plantations
of
of
magnolias
oh
no
ethelyn
began
patty
well
sweet
potatoes
then
or
something
went
on
ethelyn
nudging
her
cousin
to
keep
still
you
must
excuse
her
dress
she
could
get
anything
very
nice
in
virginia
so
mamma
has
gone
to
new
york
to
buy
her
some
decent
clothes
patty
raged
inwardly
at
this
slighting
and
unjust
remark
about
her
native
state
but
she
was
a
truly
polite
little
girl
and
said
nothing
unkind
in
reply
do
you
like
to
dance
said
mabel
miller
to
patty
later
as
they
took
places
in
a
quadrille
just
forming
yes
said
patty
and
i
know
these
quadrilles
but
i
never
saw
fancy
dances
like
those
you
have
here
oh
they
the
latest
thing
replied
mabel
professor
dodson
comes
from
new
york
and
he
teaches
us
the
newest
and
swellest
steps
as
that
day
was
the
last
of
the
quarter
the
professor
had
arranged
a
little
exhibition
of
his
best
pupils
and
a
audience
was
gathered
in
the
galleries
above
the
dancing
floor
to
witness
it
but
it
was
a
surprise
to
all
present
when
he
announced
that
a
friend
whose
name
he
was
not
privileged
to
mention
had
offered
a
prize
to
the
child
who
should
dance
most
gracefully
either
alone
or
with
a
partner
you
ca
get
it
ethelyn
said
reginald
for
you
as
awkward
as
a
lame
elephant
i
am
not
snapped
ethelyn
and
you
better
not
try
for
it
only
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
so
would
you
retorted
reginald
and
then
we
be
a
pair
of
spectacles
ethelyn
said
no
more
for
the
dances
were
beginning
some
of
the
pupils
danced
very
prettily
others
affectedly
and
others
cleverly
but
the
dances
were
of
a
kicking
romping
nature
that
required
much
practice
and
skill
to
perform
gracefully
after
all
had
taken
part
professor
dodson
turned
politely
to
patty
and
invited
her
if
she
would
to
dance
also
oh
i
could
thank
you
she
answered
i
do
know
any
of
these
flings
i
only
know
an
minuet
try
that
urged
ethelyn
who
delighted
to
have
her
cousin
made
conspicuous
as
that
attracted
attention
towards
herself
the
professor
insisted
upon
it
so
patty
obligingly
consented
and
saying
i
could
dance
with
these
things
jingling
she
gave
ethelyn
the
heavy
necklace
and
bangles
then
she
stepped
out
on
the
floor
and
as
the
orchestra
played
the
slow
stately
music
of
the
minuet
patty
bowed
and
swayed
like
a
veritable
maiden
graceful
as
a
reed
she
took
the
pretty
steps
smiling
and
curtseying
her
fair
little
face
calm
and
unflushed
it
was
such
a
pretty
dance
and
such
a
contrast
to
the
acrobatic
performances
of
the
other
dancers
that
without
a
dissenting
voice
the
committee
of
judges
awarded
the
prize
to
miss
patricia
fairfield
patty
was
delighted
for
she
had
no
idea
that
her
dancing
was
specially
meritorious
and
she
accepted
the
gold
medal
with
a
few
words
of
real
gratitude
thinking
the
while
how
pleased
her
father
would
be
when
she
should
write
him
all
about
it
on
the
way
home
she
said
to
ethelyn
but
it
does
seem
right
for
me
to
have
this
prize
as
i
not
a
member
of
the
dancing
class
oh
bother
said
ethelyn
that
does
matter
they
always
giving
out
prizes
and
i
awfully
glad
you
got
this
one
people
will
think
something
wonderful
and
i
sure
they
have
given
it
to
belle
crandon
if
you
had
danced
and
mamma
will
be
tickled
to
death
to
think
you
got
it
ahead
of
her
chapter
vi
purple
and
fine
linen
when
clair
purchases
were
sent
home
from
new
york
and
spread
out
on
view
patty
could
scarcely
believe
her
own
eyes
were
all
those
fine
clothes
really
meant
for
her
the
materials
included
silks
satins
and
velvets
in
bright
colorings
and
somewhat
conspicuous
patterns
some
of
the
dresses
were
already
made
up
and
these
were
befrilled
and
beflounced
with
lace
and
embroidery
as
patty
had
always
worn
delicate
shades
of
material
and
her
dresses
had
been
very
simply
made
she
help
protesting
at
all
this
bewildering
array
of
finery
but
her
aunt
said
nonsense
child
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
are
the
guest
of
the
clairs
and
your
appearance
must
do
us
credit
i
am
not
giving
you
these
things
you
know
your
father
wrote
me
to
buy
for
you
whatever
was
necessary
or
desirable
i
have
a
lot
of
new
clothes
for
ethelyn
too
and
i
want
you
to
look
as
well
as
she
does
while
you
are
with
us
you
must
be
suitably
dressed
else
i
shall
feel
ashamed
of
your
appearance
poor
patty
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
so
very
nice
after
all
to
have
fine
clothes
if
she
could
have
no
voice
in
their
selection
but
she
thought
what
is
the
use
of
objecting
aunt
isabel
will
do
as
she
pleases
anyway
and
while
i
staying
with
her
i
ought
to
agree
to
what
she
wants
then
two
dressmakers
came
to
stay
a
fortnight
ethelyn
and
patty
were
given
a
holiday
from
lessons
the
schoolroom
was
turned
into
a
and
miss
morton
and
reginald
betook
themselves
to
the
library
patty
was
rather
sorry
to
miss
her
school
hours
for
the
history
lessons
had
become
interesting
but
she
soon
found
that
aunt
isabel
word
was
law
it
was
a
law
often
broken
by
her
own
children
but
patty
was
not
of
a
mutinous
heart
and
she
amiably
obeyed
clair
commands
but
she
had
her
own
opinion
of
the
household
and
she
did
not
hesitate
to
express
it
plainly
in
her
letters
to
her
father
i
begin
to
see
she
wrote
to
him
one
day
what
you
meant
when
you
explained
to
me
about
proportion
in
this
house
money
and
fine
clothes
and
making
a
great
show
are
out
of
all
proportion
to
everything
else
they
never
think
of
reading
books
or
doing
charity
work
or
anything
but
showing
off
and
if
a
thing
costs
a
lot
it
all
right
but
if
it
simple
and
not
expensive
it
no
good
at
all
i
can
tell
you
papa
that
when
we
have
our
home
we
have
less
fuss
and
feathers
and
more
comfort
and
common
sense
and
it
is
only
that
the
things
cost
so
much
but
always
talking
about
it
and
telling
how
expensive
they
are
why
uncle
robert
has
told
me
times
how
much
his
horses
and
carriages
cost
and
now
he
says
he
going
to
get
an
automobile
so
i
do
know
what
he
do
with
his
horses
ethelyn
is
very
nice
in
some
ways
but
she
is
affected
and
rude
and
i
do
like
her
as
well
as
clara
hayden
if
she
my
cousin
reginald
is
a
nice
boy
but
he
sort
of
pompous
and
conceited
and
thinks
he
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
little
florelle
is
a
dear
but
she
cries
so
easily
that
i
ca
have
much
fun
with
her
but
there
now
i
told
you
all
the
bads
i
tell
you
some
of
the
goods
miss
morton
the
governess
is
a
lovely
lady
and
when
ethelyn
is
so
cross
i
ca
stand
her
i
go
to
miss
morton
and
we
have
a
walk
or
a
drive
together
and
have
nice
pleasant
talks
and
then
i
am
taking
singing
lessons
twice
a
week
aunt
isabel
says
i
have
a
pretty
good
voice
and
i
love
to
sing
and
reginald
takes
me
skating
and
that
is
splendid
i
know
how
yet
but
he
says
i
am
learning
pretty
well
aunt
isabel
gave
an
afternoon
tea
for
me
and
next
week
we
are
going
to
have
a
big
party
and
i
think
that
will
be
nice
i
like
parties
and
only
the
girls
and
boys
all
act
so
grown
up
they
are
about
my
age
and
even
younger
and
they
act
as
if
they
were
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
is
good
proportion
is
it
but
i
am
pretty
happy
except
that
i
am
often
homesick
for
you
then
i
look
at
your
picture
and
at
the
beautiful
picture
of
dear
mamma
and
it
helps
some
and
your
letters
help
me
too
so
write
just
as
often
as
you
can
wo
you
from
your
loving
daughter
patricia
fairfield
the
party
as
patty
had
feared
was
a
very
affair
for
several
days
beforehand
the
servants
were
getting
the
house
ready
for
it
and
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
the
furniture
and
were
all
removed
from
the
hall
and
and
library
and
carried
up
to
the
third
floor
to
be
out
of
the
way
the
portières
were
taken
down
from
the
doorways
and
on
the
day
of
the
party
they
were
replaced
by
simulated
curtains
of
smilax
and
flowering
vines
as
it
was
near
the
christmas
season
the
decorations
included
evergreens
holly
and
mistletoe
but
besides
these
quantities
of
roses
and
rare
flowers
of
all
sorts
were
used
the
florists
came
early
and
worked
all
day
and
they
transformed
the
house
into
a
fairy
bower
patty
was
delighted
with
this
and
walked
through
the
luxurious
rooms
quite
lost
in
admiration
of
their
floral
beauty
carpenters
had
enclosed
the
great
veranda
which
was
then
hung
with
red
satin
and
decorated
with
ropes
and
wreaths
of
holly
and
like
the
rest
of
the
house
was
fairly
ablaze
with
electric
lights
the
party
was
to
be
from
eight
to
twelve
and
when
patty
went
down
stairs
at
a
little
before
eight
she
found
her
uncle
berating
the
musicians
who
were
a
little
late
in
arriving
i
want
you
to
understand
clair
was
saying
that
when
send
for
you
you
are
to
come
when
i
bid
you
do
tell
me
you
could
help
it
if
there
is
danger
of
detention
on
the
road
you
should
start
earlier
am
accustomed
to
having
orders
obeyed
and
all
who
are
employed
at
villa
rosa
must
fully
understand
that
go
on
with
your
music
and
next
time
see
to
it
that
you
arrive
more
promptly
uncle
robert
strutted
away
with
such
a
pompous
air
that
patty
was
almost
afraid
of
him
herself
but
when
he
saw
her
he
beamed
kindly
and
said
come
here
my
dear
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
all
this
i
think
the
house
looks
beautiful
uncle
just
like
fairyland
with
all
the
flowers
and
lights
and
i
think
you
are
very
kind
to
give
this
party
for
me
well
well
child
we
have
to
invite
our
friends
occasionally
you
know
have
a
good
time
and
i
shall
feel
amply
repaid
for
my
outlay
those
american
beauties
are
fine
are
they
indeed
they
are
said
patty
sniffing
at
one
that
reached
its
rich
redness
temptingly
towards
her
oh
do
do
that
you
spoil
them
those
roses
cost
six
dollars
a
dozen
but
how
fine
you
look
in
your
new
turn
round
little
one
ah
we
have
no
reason
to
feel
ashamed
of
our
southern
maid
patty
was
glad
her
uncle
was
pleased
for
she
herself
felt
rather
uncomfortable
her
dress
which
was
made
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
was
of
red
silk
gauze
with
multifold
short
skirts
and
edged
with
thick
full
ruches
great
golden
butterflies
were
embroidered
at
intervals
all
over
the
dress
while
ribbons
and
flowers
were
attached
wherever
a
place
could
be
found
for
them
ethelyn
had
coaxed
patty
to
have
her
hair
dressed
high
on
her
head
so
elise
had
arranged
a
marvelous
which
displayed
jeweled
pins
and
combs
of
many
sorts
and
a
necklace
and
bracelets
rivaled
them
in
glitter
red
silk
stockings
and
red
satin
slippers
with
gilt
butterflies
on
them
completed
this
gorgeous
costume
and
when
patty
saw
herself
in
the
long
mirrors
she
thought
she
looked
like
one
of
the
paper
fairies
which
she
used
to
hang
on
her
christmas
trees
when
the
party
began
she
stood
beside
her
aunt
and
ethelyn
and
received
the
guests
as
they
arrived
about
fifty
boys
and
girls
came
and
to
patty
they
all
seemed
like
overdressed
and
artificial
little
puppets
the
girls
put
on
airs
walked
with
mincing
steps
and
giggled
behind
their
fans
while
the
boys
were
affected
and
absurdly
formal
patty
had
thought
there
would
be
games
or
amusements
of
some
youthful
sort
but
dancing
and
promenading
alternated
throughout
the
evening
however
she
was
fond
of
dancing
and
as
she
was
quickly
becoming
a
general
favorite
her
card
was
soon
filled
with
the
names
of
the
nicest
boys
in
the
room
it
was
all
very
pleasant
for
a
short
time
but
soon
patty
grew
very
tired
and
secretly
longed
for
supper
to
be
announced
at
last
this
came
to
pass
and
the
children
marched
out
to
the
where
another
beautiful
sight
awaited
them
the
caterers
had
been
as
skilful
as
the
decorators
and
the
table
was
filled
with
marvelous
confections
of
rich
foods
patty
had
never
seen
such
wonderful
things
and
she
almost
thought
the
pheasants
were
alive
and
the
big
salmon
looked
as
if
it
had
just
been
taken
from
the
water
then
there
were
salads
and
croquettes
and
funny
little
paper
dishes
filled
with
strange
delicious
mixtures
and
after
all
these
came
creams
and
jellies
and
ices
and
cakes
and
bonbons
in
all
sorts
of
odd
shapes
and
colors
patty
thought
these
things
were
too
pretty
to
be
eaten
but
they
were
quickly
demolished
by
the
young
people
who
were
hearty
hungry
boys
and
girls
in
spite
of
their
affected
manners
after
supper
the
dancing
and
promenading
began
again
and
was
kept
up
until
midnight
and
patty
was
a
very
tired
little
girl
after
she
had
said
to
all
the
guests
and
the
last
carriage
had
rolled
away
from
villa
rosa
ethelyn
was
tired
too
and
decidedly
cross
i
did
have
a
very
good
time
she
said
that
horrid
old
gladys
mahoney
had
a
prettier
dress
than
mine
and
i
broke
my
new
fan
and
my
slippers
are
so
tight
they
hurt
me
awfully
pooh
i
know
what
makes
you
cross
said
reginald
just
bob
burton
did
dance
with
you
as
much
as
he
did
with
mabel
miller
i
not
cross
retorted
ethelyn
and
i
did
want
to
dance
with
bob
burton
if
i
were
you
i
try
to
learn
some
manners
lou
smith
says
the
rudest
boy
she
ever
saw
i
do
care
what
lou
smith
says
little
thing
i
do
see
why
she
was
invited
here
anyway
stop
quarreling
children
said
clair
and
go
to
bed
at
once
patricia
i
hope
you
enjoyed
the
party
i
sure
i
tried
to
have
it
nice
but
everything
seemed
to
go
wrong
the
salad
was
fit
to
eat
and
the
ice
cream
was
half
melted
why
aunt
isabel
said
patty
i
think
everything
was
lovely
i
never
saw
such
a
in
my
life
and
the
decorations
were
exquisite
well
i
did
think
so
it
does
seem
a
shame
to
pay
out
so
much
money
and
then
not
have
things
to
your
liking
oh
the
party
was
good
enough
said
clair
you
too
fussy
about
trifles
isabel
come
children
scurry
off
to
bed
you
get
no
beauty
sleep
i
fear
patty
went
to
her
room
and
taking
her
mother
picture
sat
down
to
talk
to
it
as
she
did
nearly
every
night
motherdy
she
said
if
you
had
lived
to
take
care
of
me
i
do
believe
you
have
liked
the
party
we
had
the
of
it
was
all
out
of
proportion
for
children
i
think
and
as
usual
in
this
house
the
expense
was
out
of
proportion
to
everything
else
why
uncle
robert
must
have
spent
a
thousand
dollars
for
it
maybe
more
he
probably
tell
us
just
how
much
everything
cost
i
liked
some
of
the
party
the
supper
was
lovely
but
well
i
reckon
i
ate
out
of
proportion
too
you
see
little
mother
it
very
hard
always
to
do
just
right
now
i
going
to
bed
and
i
so
sleepy
i
do
know
as
i
wake
up
before
afternoon
she
kissed
the
beautiful
face
and
putting
the
picture
back
where
it
belonged
she
hopped
into
bed
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
chapter
vii
a
the
winter
slipped
away
and
as
patty
was
a
little
girl
who
always
looked
on
the
bright
side
of
things
she
really
had
very
good
times
at
ville
rosa
she
became
a
favorite
with
the
elmbridge
boys
and
girls
and
her
unfailing
good
nature
kept
her
from
quarreling
with
her
cousins
though
she
was
often
sorely
tried
by
them
lessons
were
a
very
uncertain
quantity
sometimes
there
would
be
none
at
all
for
a
week
or
two
weeks
and
then
perhaps
school
would
keep
regularly
for
a
few
days
only
to
be
followed
by
another
interruption
patty
found
it
only
too
easy
to
fall
into
these
careless
ways
and
if
she
had
stayed
all
her
life
at
villa
rosa
i
fear
she
would
have
become
indolent
and
selfish
for
the
rule
of
the
whole
household
seemed
to
be
pleasure
before
duty
and
when
that
rule
is
followed
it
often
happens
that
the
duties
are
not
done
at
all
in
january
to
patty
great
delight
there
came
a
heavy
snowstorm
it
made
fine
sleighing
for
the
roads
were
in
just
the
right
condition
and
as
the
weather
was
clear
and
cold
there
was
good
prospect
of
many
fun
uncle
robert
always
ready
to
give
the
young
people
a
good
time
instigated
a
sleighing
parade
in
which
all
the
society
people
of
elmbridge
were
invited
to
join
it
was
to
be
a
grand
affair
every
sleigh
was
to
be
decorated
in
beautiful
or
unique
fashion
and
there
was
great
rivalry
among
the
families
of
elmbridge
as
to
whose
sleigh
should
present
the
finest
spectacle
papa
said
ethelyn
i
shall
drive
patricia
in
my
little
cutter
of
course
and
i
want
you
to
fix
it
up
somehow
so
that
it
will
beat
everybody
else
all
hollow
ethelyn
said
her
mother
if
you
do
stop
using
those
slang
phrases
you
sha
go
in
the
parade
at
all
now
promise
to
talk
like
a
lady
and
i
see
to
it
that
your
sleigh
outshines
all
the
rest
all
right
said
ethelyn
i
promise
now
how
shall
we
decorate
it
never
mind
said
her
mother
i
would
trust
you
with
the
secret
tell
everybody
before
the
parade
and
give
them
a
chance
to
imitate
it
but
just
wait
and
see
you
and
patricia
shall
drive
the
most
beautiful
turnout
in
the
whole
line
that
day
clair
made
a
hurried
trip
to
new
york
and
came
home
with
many
mysterious
packages
and
other
larger
packages
came
by
express
clair
came
home
early
from
his
business
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
barn
and
the
preparations
grew
so
exciting
that
both
patty
and
ethelyn
were
on
tiptoe
with
curiosity
and
anticipation
the
parade
was
to
start
the
next
afternoon
at
two
soon
after
luncheon
clair
sent
the
girls
to
their
rooms
to
dress
for
the
great
event
ethelyn
gave
a
little
scream
of
delight
as
she
saw
new
garments
spread
out
on
her
bed
and
patty
ran
on
to
her
own
room
to
find
similar
ones
there
each
girl
had
a
long
coat
of
fine
white
broadcloth
made
with
a
double
and
trimmed
all
round
with
white
fur
a
white
felt
hat
with
white
ostrich
plumes
and
a
fleecy
white
feather
boa
white
gloves
and
a
white
muff
were
there
too
and
even
white
shoes
and
white
cloth
leggings
so
that
when
the
cousins
were
dressed
there
was
not
a
touch
of
color
about
them
save
their
rosy
faces
and
golden
hair
and
they
looked
like
veritable
they
danced
to
find
cupid
awaiting
them
with
a
sleigh
cupid
was
ethelyn
pony
and
he
was
pure
white
every
bit
of
him
and
it
was
this
fact
that
had
suggested
the
whole
scheme
to
clair
the
new
sleigh
was
pure
white
too
trimmed
here
and
there
with
silver
cupid
harness
was
all
white
and
silver
and
waving
white
plumes
and
silver
bells
were
in
various
places
about
the
sleigh
and
horse
there
were
big
white
fur
robes
and
when
clair
tucked
the
girls
in
and
ethelyn
took
the
white
reins
and
white
whip
it
certainly
seemed
as
if
no
sleigh
load
could
be
prettier
and
none
was
everybody
agreed
that
the
white
sleigh
was
the
pride
of
the
parade
patty
secretly
wondered
why
her
aunt
was
satisfied
without
more
gaudy
coloring
as
she
wrote
to
her
father
afterwards
she
had
half
expected
to
see
a
red
sleigh
with
blue
and
yellow
robes
but
she
said
i
suppose
it
was
because
cupid
happened
to
be
white
and
i
glad
he
was
for
it
was
all
just
lovely
and
clair
and
florelle
went
in
the
parade
also
but
they
contented
themselves
with
the
family
sleigh
which
of
course
was
both
handsome
and
elaborate
they
had
spent
all
their
energies
on
the
appearance
and
they
were
very
proud
of
the
result
reginald
who
was
of
an
ingenious
turn
of
mind
had
contrived
an
affair
which
was
supposed
to
look
like
a
roman
chariot
and
which
was
therefore
a
bit
incongruous
on
runners
it
was
very
fancy
being
almost
entirely
covered
with
gilt
paper
and
it
had
two
wheels
and
no
back
it
jolted
fearfully
and
reginald
was
occasionally
thrown
out
however
he
stuck
to
it
pluckily
until
his
machine
was
a
total
wreck
when
he
abandoned
it
and
jumped
into
his
father
sleigh
for
the
rest
of
the
parade
patty
enjoyed
it
all
hugely
it
was
such
a
novel
experience
to
fly
along
through
the
crisp
cold
air
and
over
the
shining
snow
roads
and
ethelyn
was
in
such
jubilant
that
the
whole
affair
marked
a
red
letter
day
in
the
winter
calendar
the
white
flyer
was
the
talk
of
the
town
for
weeks
after
and
clair
never
tired
of
telling
any
one
who
would
listen
how
much
it
all
cost
and
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
the
white
sleigh
and
harness
on
such
short
notice
patty
grew
very
tired
of
this
pompous
boasting
and
notwithstanding
her
enjoyment
of
the
luxury
at
villa
rosa
she
was
not
altogether
sorry
when
the
time
drew
near
for
her
to
go
away
to
boston
to
make
her
next
visit
she
was
to
leave
the
clairs
about
the
first
of
march
and
spend
the
next
three
months
with
her
father
sister
fleming
as
uncle
robert
was
her
mother
brother
the
two
families
were
entirely
unacquainted
and
the
clairs
could
tell
patty
nothing
about
the
new
home
to
which
she
was
going
but
said
her
aunt
isabel
i
feel
sure
you
wo
like
them
as
well
as
you
like
us
are
they
rich
patricia
i
do
know
answered
patty
papa
never
said
anything
about
that
he
said
that
they
are
a
very
literary
family
humph
said
aunt
isabel
then
i
guess
they
have
very
much
money
literary
people
never
do
have
poor
child
i
suppose
they
turn
you
into
a
regular
little
patty
did
relish
this
idea
for
at
villa
rosa
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
neglecting
her
lessons
and
already
study
was
losing
its
charm
for
her
but
she
was
fond
of
reading
and
she
felt
sure
she
would
enjoy
an
atmosphere
of
books
on
the
of
february
aunt
isabel
gave
a
party
for
the
young
people
which
was
a
farewell
party
for
patty
though
it
was
also
a
festival
in
honor
of
valentine
day
as
usual
the
girls
had
new
dresses
and
they
represented
idea
of
valentines
ethelyn
was
of
blue
and
patty
of
pink
silk
and
they
were
trimmed
with
innumerable
lace
flutings
and
garlands
of
flowers
they
were
further
decorated
with
gilt
hearts
pierced
by
darts
and
with
skilfully
made
artificial
doves
which
perched
on
the
shoulders
of
the
wearers
the
party
was
a
very
pretty
one
as
aunt
isabel
parties
always
were
the
rooms
were
decorated
with
roses
and
pink
ribbons
and
gilt
hearts
and
darts
and
feathered
doves
and
wax
cupids
at
supper
the
ices
and
cakes
were
and
after
the
children
had
returned
to
the
valentine
himself
appeared
as
patty
suspected
it
was
uncle
robert
dressed
up
to
represent
the
old
saint
with
flowing
white
hair
and
beard
and
a
gilt
paper
halo
he
wore
a
long
white
robe
with
red
hearts
dotted
all
over
it
and
carried
a
gilt
bow
and
arrow
he
carried
also
a
pack
or
pouch
full
of
valentines
which
he
distributed
to
the
guests
of
course
they
were
very
handsome
affairs
and
in
each
was
hidden
some
dainty
trifle
handkerchief
fan
or
bonbons
besides
those
at
the
party
patty
received
numerous
other
valentines
some
of
which
came
by
mail
and
others
in
the
good
way
under
the
front
door
many
of
these
were
from
the
elmbridge
young
people
while
several
from
richmond
included
a
beauty
from
her
father
and
a
pretty
one
from
clara
hayden
although
the
cousins
had
varying
tastes
they
had
become
very
good
friends
and
both
felt
sad
when
the
day
came
for
patty
to
leave
villa
rosa
indeed
the
whole
family
felt
sad
for
patty
was
a
very
lovable
little
girl
and
had
endeared
herself
to
them
all
uncle
robert
was
to
take
her
to
new
york
and
put
her
on
the
boat
where
tom
fleming
would
meet
her
and
take
her
to
his
mother
house
in
boston
aunt
isabel
said
she
too
would
go
to
new
york
with
patty
and
of
course
ethelyn
announced
her
intention
of
going
then
florelle
set
up
such
a
howl
to
go
that
patty
begged
her
aunt
to
take
her
and
the
child
went
reginald
declined
to
be
left
out
of
such
a
family
affair
so
patty
was
amply
escorted
to
her
destination
they
went
on
board
the
a
beautiful
boat
of
the
fall
river
line
and
clair
soon
found
fleming
who
had
agreed
to
meet
him
at
a
certain
spot
then
patty
was
introduced
to
her
cousin
tom
who
was
a
tall
young
man
of
about
with
a
pointed
beard
and
dark
pleasant
eyes
so
this
is
my
little
southern
cousin
he
said
cordially
as
he
took
her
hand
then
he
chatted
affably
with
the
whole
party
until
the
warning
gong
announced
that
they
must
go
ashore
ethelyn
was
at
the
thought
of
parting
and
flinging
her
arms
round
patty
neck
burst
into
tears
this
was
enough
for
florelle
who
promptly
followed
suit
and
set
up
one
of
her
very
best
howls
with
a
kiss
to
his
niece
uncle
robert
picked
up
the
screaming
child
and
marshaled
his
family
off
of
the
boat
and
patty
was
left
alone
with
her
cousin
chapter
viii
an
cousin
now
patty
said
cousin
tom
as
they
walked
along
the
saloon
i
am
going
to
hand
you
over
to
the
stewardess
who
will
show
you
your
stateroom
go
with
her
and
she
will
look
after
you
i
think
you
would
better
leave
off
that
heavy
coat
as
it
is
too
chilly
outside
to
permit
of
going
on
deck
and
the
atmosphere
within
is
quite
warm
ah
here
she
is
stewardess
this
is
miss
fairfield
and
here
is
her
stateroom
key
see
to
it
that
she
is
made
comfortable
as
fleming
supplemented
his
request
with
a
pecuniary
argument
the
stewardess
made
patty
her
especial
charge
and
assiduously
looked
after
her
comfort
and
patty
said
her
cousin
as
she
turned
away
when
you
are
ready
come
back
and
you
will
find
me
right
here
see
just
by
this
staircase
lock
your
door
and
bring
the
key
with
you
patty
felt
as
if
she
had
suddenly
grown
several
years
younger
for
cousin
tom
talked
to
her
as
to
a
little
child
it
more
like
wonderland
than
ever
she
said
to
herself
only
instead
of
growing
big
or
little
i
grow
old
or
young
at
aunt
isabel
i
was
considered
a
young
lady
but
cousin
tom
seems
to
think
i
a
small
child
the
stewardess
who
was
a
old
colored
woman
took
patty
to
her
stateroom
and
then
helped
her
to
unpack
her
and
arrange
her
belongings
for
the
night
as
aunt
isabel
had
bought
her
clothes
of
course
patty
was
absurdly
overdressed
when
she
took
off
her
blue
velvet
coat
with
its
ermine
collar
her
blue
silk
dress
looked
far
more
suitable
for
a
grand
reception
than
for
traveling
laws
missy
said
the
voluble
stewardess
how
handsome
you
is
patty
thought
this
a
reference
to
her
dress
but
the
remark
was
meant
for
the
child
herself
whose
face
looked
out
from
a
most
becoming
big
hat
of
plaited
blue
velvet
and
her
golden
hair
fell
in
a
loosely
tied
bunch
of
long
thick
curls
when
patty
returned
to
her
cousin
tom
she
found
him
sitting
just
where
he
said
he
would
be
but
so
deeply
absorbed
in
a
book
that
he
did
see
or
hear
her
approach
not
wishing
to
disturb
his
reading
she
sat
down
in
the
large
chair
next
to
him
and
waited
she
did
mind
this
at
all
for
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
the
people
passing
up
and
down
and
the
saloon
itself
was
beautiful
to
look
at
patty
sat
for
a
long
while
but
cousin
tom
never
moved
except
to
turn
the
pages
of
his
book
she
did
not
like
to
speak
to
him
as
she
feared
he
would
think
it
necessary
to
lay
aside
his
book
and
entertain
her
she
had
no
wish
to
trouble
him
and
beside
she
was
quite
capable
of
entertaining
herself
so
after
she
had
sat
still
for
a
long
while
she
decided
to
walk
about
the
cabin
a
bit
always
keeping
in
sight
of
cousin
tom
if
he
should
raise
his
eyes
but
he
did
and
patty
strayed
farther
and
farther
away
from
him
until
she
had
explored
all
the
available
parts
of
the
boat
she
was
much
interested
in
all
she
saw
and
many
admiring
eyes
followed
the
pretty
graceful
child
as
she
walked
about
when
she
reached
the
she
looked
in
and
the
sight
of
the
passengers
sitting
at
tables
made
her
feel
very
hungry
and
she
wondered
if
cousin
tom
would
finish
his
book
in
time
to
give
her
any
dinner
somehow
she
felt
sure
he
never
would
look
up
until
he
finished
the
book
she
went
back
and
sat
down
again
beside
him
with
a
little
sigh
but
he
did
hear
the
little
sigh
and
kept
on
reading
patty
looked
at
him
curiously
there
was
little
hope
of
his
finishing
the
book
for
he
was
only
about
through
it
and
he
read
very
slowly
turning
the
pages
at
long
intervals
she
could
see
his
eyes
move
eagerly
along
the
printed
lines
as
if
delighted
with
what
he
found
there
she
waited
a
while
longer
and
then
said
to
herself
i
do
care
going
to
speak
to
him
i
waited
a
million
hours
and
the
dinner
will
be
all
eaten
up
she
did
speak
but
she
rose
and
stood
by
his
side
and
then
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
laid
her
hand
with
outspread
fingers
upon
the
page
he
was
reading
cousin
tom
jumped
as
if
a
firecracker
had
exploded
in
his
vicinity
and
he
looked
at
patty
with
a
dazed
expression
bless
my
soul
he
said
why
little
one
i
forgot
all
about
you
will
you
forgive
me
have
you
been
here
long
i
was
reading
you
see
and
i
did
hear
you
come
i
been
here
an
hour
cousin
tom
said
patty
demurely
an
hour
no
is
it
possible
you
poor
child
why
did
you
tell
me
oh
i
did
mind
said
patty
and
you
seemed
to
be
all
wrapped
up
in
your
book
yes
i
was
i
was
but
i
try
to
make
amends
come
let
go
and
have
some
dinner
taking
patty
hand
cousin
tom
strode
along
the
saloon
and
down
the
stairs
and
patty
almost
had
to
run
to
keep
up
with
his
long
steps
now
said
he
as
they
seated
themselves
at
a
table
and
an
obsequious
waiter
began
to
put
ice
and
then
water
into
their
glasses
now
what
would
you
like
to
eat
oh
anything
at
all
said
patty
gaily
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
i
do
know
what
yes
yes
of
course
you
are
poor
child
so
sorry
i
forgot
you
quite
inexcusable
of
me
fleming
was
looking
over
the
bill
of
fare
as
he
talked
and
then
he
looked
doubtfully
at
patty
as
if
uncertain
what
he
ought
to
order
for
her
what
would
you
like
for
your
dinner
child
now
do
say
you
do
care
or
that
you
leave
it
to
me
for
little
girls
always
say
that
and
i
declare
i
do
know
what
you
ought
to
have
all
right
said
patty
who
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
let
have
some
lobster
mayonnaise
and
some
mushrooms
under
glass
and
little
tiny
clams
and
and
a
dewey
punch
cousin
tom
stared
at
her
in
amazement
what
are
you
talking
about
he
exclaimed
you
be
dead
if
you
ate
all
those
things
are
they
on
the
bill
of
fare
what
is
a
punch
oh
i
do
die
so
easily
as
that
ethelyn
and
i
used
to
eat
worse
mixes
than
that
whenever
we
lunched
at
the
new
york
restaurants
a
dewey
punch
is
a
lovely
kind
of
ice
cream
with
strawberry
jam
or
something
poured
all
over
it
i
do
see
it
on
the
list
perhaps
they
do
have
it
never
mind
we
take
meringue
glacé
indeed
we
wo
i
changed
my
mind
and
i
order
this
dinner
myself
you
shall
have
some
soup
a
broiled
chicken
some
vegetables
and
a
plain
ice
cream
there
how
do
you
like
that
cousin
tom
did
speak
crossly
at
all
but
very
decidedly
and
there
was
a
pleasant
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
took
away
all
idea
of
censure
so
patty
said
amiably
i
think
it
will
be
very
nice
and
i
really
do
care
what
we
have
only
you
told
me
to
suggest
something
so
i
did
certainly
that
all
right
but
your
suggestions
were
suicidal
are
you
familiar
with
bacon
oh
thought
patty
he
going
to
order
the
breakfast
over
night
and
i
hate
bacon
yes
she
said
but
i
do
like
it
at
all
you
do
what
a
perverted
taste
but
boston
will
soon
change
that
we
have
a
bacon
club
which
you
shall
join
it
is
a
most
delightful
club
and
you
will
like
it
i
sure
i
fancy
that
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
see
you
devouring
bacon
with
intense
enjoyment
indeed
i
wo
thought
patty
she
was
about
to
say
that
her
uncle
robert
belonged
to
a
terrapin
club
but
refrained
thinking
it
might
be
impolite
to
imply
disparagement
to
the
more
lowly
bacon
so
she
changed
the
subject
and
said
please
cousin
tom
tell
me
something
of
your
family
it
so
queer
to
go
to
see
people
and
not
know
anything
about
them
beforehand
but
so
far
my
relatives
have
been
very
nice
oh
the
flemings
are
a
wonderful
family
said
cousin
tom
gaily
we
are
all
going
to
do
something
great
but
somehow
we
have
hit
it
off
yet
cousin
elizabeth
is
an
author
is
she
inquired
patty
a
little
timidly
for
she
had
never
seen
a
real
live
author
yes
said
fleming
elizabeth
is
an
author
that
is
she
writes
novels
when
she
is
doing
anything
else
barbara
is
a
club
woman
but
she
writes
too
more
or
less
and
what
do
you
do
are
you
literary
yes
i
writing
a
book
myself
it
a
treatise
on
the
will
and
i
flatter
myself
i
have
some
novel
theories
and
then
there
ruth
you
know
ruth
who
is
she
oh
she
our
cousin
who
lives
with
us
not
your
cousin
you
know
she
is
father
brother
child
and
her
people
live
in
the
country
so
as
she
has
a
fine
mind
she
lives
with
us
in
order
to
have
the
advantage
of
a
boston
education
how
old
is
she
asked
patty
fourteen
or
fifteen
i
think
she
be
company
for
you
i
think
like
her
though
she
is
very
different
from
you
what
is
she
like
asked
patty
much
interested
in
this
new
and
unexpected
comrade
why
she
is
quiet
and
very
studious
and
but
you
see
her
yourself
so
i
let
you
form
your
own
opinion
after
dinner
they
had
a
short
promenade
on
deck
but
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
patty
was
glad
to
return
to
the
warm
light
saloon
and
they
sat
down
on
one
of
the
red
velvet
sofas
cousin
tom
did
resume
his
book
and
patty
felt
that
he
was
politely
trying
to
entertain
her
so
with
a
desire
to
entertain
him
in
return
she
asked
him
to
tell
her
about
the
book
he
was
writing
this
seemed
to
please
him
immensely
and
he
eagerly
launched
into
a
description
of
its
scope
and
plan
as
the
subject
was
far
above
patty
comprehension
she
listened
without
understanding
it
clearly
at
all
and
after
a
half
hour
or
so
the
continuous
conversation
and
the
soothing
motion
of
the
boat
caused
the
little
girl
quite
unintentionally
to
fall
sound
asleep
fleming
kept
on
talking
for
some
time
after
this
when
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
his
cousin
sat
very
still
and
peering
round
the
corner
of
the
big
blue
velvet
hat
he
discovered
that
his
audience
was
quite
oblivious
to
his
learned
discourse
at
first
he
looked
a
little
annoyed
then
he
smiled
compassionately
for
the
tired
child
seemed
to
be
very
peacefully
resting
and
her
pretty
head
made
a
lovely
picture
against
the
red
velvet
sofa
fleming
sent
for
the
stewardess
and
then
awoke
the
little
sleeper
come
patty
said
he
gently
tapping
her
on
the
shoulder
it
bedtime
little
girl
and
you
must
run
away
to
your
bunk
patty
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
about
her
oh
cousin
tom
she
said
as
she
remembered
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
fallen
asleep
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
go
to
sleep
and
i
interested
that
all
right
my
small
cousin
said
fleming
and
now
go
along
with
the
stewardess
and
go
to
sleep
and
get
a
good
night
rest
patty
did
as
cousin
tom
directed
and
never
wakened
until
she
heard
the
steamer
scraping
against
the
dock
early
the
next
morning
she
rose
and
dressed
quickly
and
when
the
stewardess
came
for
her
she
was
quite
ready
to
go
to
meet
cousin
tom
who
awaited
her
in
the
cabin
i
shall
give
you
a
roll
and
a
cup
of
coffee
he
said
as
if
half
afraid
that
patty
would
want
to
order
dishes
for
they
are
expecting
us
home
to
breakfast
and
we
have
only
fifteen
minutes
before
our
train
starts
for
boston
patty
drank
her
coffee
and
ate
her
roll
with
a
relish
and
declared
herself
ready
to
start
a
short
ride
in
the
cars
brought
them
to
boston
they
left
the
train
and
entered
the
where
cousin
tom
placed
patty
in
a
seat
and
told
her
to
stay
there
and
not
move
while
he
attended
to
her
trunks
patty
obediently
sat
still
and
soon
she
saw
cousin
tom
returning
but
just
before
he
reached
her
he
met
a
man
whom
he
evidently
knew
and
whom
he
seemed
overjoyed
to
meet
the
two
men
talked
earnestly
together
and
then
both
turned
and
walked
away
patty
had
seen
instances
of
her
cousin
even
since
he
had
neglected
to
take
her
to
dinner
the
night
before
and
she
guessed
at
once
that
he
had
forgotten
her
existence
and
was
going
away
with
his
friend
she
had
no
intention
of
being
deserted
in
this
way
so
she
left
the
bags
and
wraps
which
she
was
supposed
to
be
guarding
and
ran
after
him
cousin
tom
she
cried
as
she
caught
up
with
him
where
are
you
going
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
staring
at
her
i
forgot
you
were
with
me
what
shall
i
do
allow
me
to
present
harding
ted
this
is
my
cousin
miss
patty
fairfield
i
am
supposed
to
be
escorting
her
home
but
if
what
you
tell
me
is
so
i
must
go
at
once
to
see
varian
wait

have
it
patty
i
send
you
home
by
a
messenger
you
do
mind
do
you
no
indeed
cousin
tom
said
patty
send
me
any
way
you
like
so
fleming
called
a
and
giving
patty
and
all
the
wraps
and
bags
into
his
charge
he
sent
them
to
his
mother
house
tell
them
i
met
harding
and
had
to
go
away
with
him
on
some
very
important
business
he
said
to
patty
i
be
home
and
with
a
hasty
he
turned
again
to
his
friend
and
they
walked
rapidly
away
come
this
way
miss
said
the
messenger
who
was
a
tall
youth
polite
and
deferential
and
who
appeared
not
at
all
surprised
at
the
order
given
him
i
take
you
along
all
right
he
piloted
patty
with
great
care
and
after
riding
for
some
distance
on
the
street
cars
they
arrived
at
fleming
house
chapter
ix
the
flemings
the
rang
the
door
bell
and
a
maid
opened
the
door
when
she
saw
the
uniformed
youth
she
held
out
her
hand
for
his
book
signed
it
and
dismissed
him
then
turning
to
patty
she
said
this
way
miss
and
ushered
her
into
a
small
reception
room
as
patty
wrote
to
her
father
afterwards
she
felt
like
a
package
sent
from
a
department
store
and
she
looked
down
almost
expecting
to
find
herself
wrapped
in
paper
and
tied
with
a
string
after
she
had
waited
about
ten
minutes
a
tall
young
woman
came
quickly
and
passed
along
the
hall
she
had
on
a
hat
and
jacket
and
was
evidently
going
away
in
a
great
hurry
as
she
went
by
the
reception
room
she
caught
sight
of
patty
through
the
open
door
and
stopped
in
surprise
she
said
in
a
quick
hurried
way
did
you
wish
to
see
me
i
do
know
said
patty
uncertain
whether
this
was
a
cousin
or
a
visitor
at
the
house
i
am
patty
fairfield
oh
yes
of
course
our
cousin
from
the
south
i
so
glad
to
see
you
she
shook
patty
hand
hastily
but
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
this
morning
as
i
am
just
going
to
a
meeting
of
the
events
club
and
i
am
already
five
minutes
late
with
an
apologetic
smile
she
hastened
away
and
patty
waited
again
then
she
heard
another
step
on
the
stairs
and
another
lady
entered
the
room
this
time
it
was
aunt
hester
she
was
a
delicate
looking
little
woman
with
silver
hair
but
patty
knew
her
at
once
from
her
resemblance
to
her
father
who
was
fleming
brother
my
dear
child
said
her
aunt
as
she
kissed
patty
affectionately
we
are
very
glad
to
have
you
with
us
but
where
is
tom
he
met
a
friend
harding
and
went
away
with
him
on
very
important
business
he
said
to
tell
you
he
would
be
home
and
he
sent
me
here
by
a
very
well
i
am
glad
you
reached
here
safely
are
you
hungry
have
you
breakfasted
i
had
coffee
and
rolls
on
the
boat
but
i
hungry
said
patty
frankly
of
course
you
are
well
you
shall
have
something
to
eat
let
me
look
at
you
yes
you
do
look
a
little
like
brother
fred
how
old
are
you
fourteen
replied
patty
ah
just
the
age
of
ruth
fleming
who
lives
with
us
and
who
will
be
pleasant
company
for
you
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
with
us
my
dear
and
you
must
mind
being
left
to
yourself
a
bit
for
we
are
very
busy
people
life
is
too
short
to
be
wasted
in
idleness
yes
assented
patty
thinking
that
this
aunt
was
indeed
very
different
from
aunt
isabel
and
now
continued
fleming
i
am
going
to
send
molly
to
you
and
she
will
show
you
to
your
room
and
afterwards
give
you
some
breakfast
i
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
this
morning
as
i
have
to
go
to
the
ruth
is
at
school
but
we
will
all
meet
at
luncheon
which
is
served
promptly
at
one
fleming
went
away
not
hurriedly
but
with
a
quick
decided
step
and
in
a
few
moments
molly
the
maid
appeared
she
was
a
irish
girl
and
her
pleasant
smile
was
such
a
contrast
to
the
preoccupied
manners
of
the
ladies
that
patty
felt
friendly
towards
her
at
once
come
with
me
miss
fairfield
she
said
and
taking
up
she
led
the
way
to
a
room
on
the
third
floor
it
was
a
room
very
neat
and
but
with
none
of
the
luxury
and
beauty
of
patty
room
at
villa
rosa
there
was
a
square
and
exactly
in
the
centre
of
it
was
a
square
pincushion
with
a
glass
toilet
bottle
on
either
side
and
behind
it
a
smaller
glass
bottle
to
match
the
chairs
were
stiff
and
straight
and
there
was
a
haircloth
sofa
with
a
small
square
pillow
at
each
end
and
one
in
the
middle
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
table
with
books
on
it
and
writing
materials
and
a
hung
over
it
from
the
chandelier
above
though
plain
in
its
appointments
the
room
was
light
and
airy
and
exquisitely
neat
and
molly
deftly
unfastened
patty
bag
and
and
then
said
now
miss
i
go
below
and
when
you
ready
come
down
three
flights
of
stairs
to
the
and
i
give
you
some
breakfast
patty
thanked
her
and
when
she
had
left
the
room
patty
sat
down
in
the
small
to
think
herself
out
as
she
sometimes
expressed
it
she
felt
a
little
homesick
for
the
friends
at
villa
rosa
and
yet
she
felt
sure
her
boston
relatives
were
going
to
be
very
nice
if
only
they
could
ever
find
time
to
talk
to
her
she
wondered
if
the
ladies
were
always
hurrying
off
to
and
if
ruth
were
always
studying
she
would
be
glad
when
cousin
tom
came
home
for
she
was
very
sure
she
liked
him
she
looked
critically
at
her
surroundings
and
decided
that
when
her
trunks
came
and
she
could
put
the
pretty
things
that
she
owned
all
about
the
room
would
look
much
more
cozy
and
attractive
and
so
though
her
reception
had
chilled
her
a
little
she
thought
that
perhaps
she
would
have
a
good
time
in
boston
after
all
she
jumped
up
and
began
to
arrange
such
things
as
she
had
brought
with
her
her
pretty
silver
brushes
and
trays
looked
somewhat
out
of
place
on
the
prim
but
patty
thought
them
a
decided
improvement
then
she
unwrapped
her
mother
portrait
and
placed
it
on
the
it
a
funny
place
this
motherdy
she
whispered
to
the
picture
and
i
do
know
whether
we
like
it
or
not
but
we
be
happy
together
you
and
i
and
i
think
we
like
aunt
hester
for
she
papa
sister
you
know
so
she
must
be
nice
then
patty
went
down
the
three
flights
of
stairs
as
directed
in
search
of
molly
it
funny
she
said
to
herself
to
go
down
cellar
to
breakfast
but
sure
she
said
three
flights
and
sure
enough
when
she
reached
the
basement
molly
met
her
with
a
kindly
smile
saying
come
this
way
miss
and
patty
found
that
the
front
basement
was
the
its
large
windows
were
protected
by
iron
railings
and
the
whole
room
had
an
air
of
solemn
dignity
rather
than
cheerfulness
but
molly
was
so
pleasant
and
cordial
that
patty
felt
cheerful
at
once
the
smiling
irish
girl
brought
her
some
fruit
an
omelet
hot
rolls
and
delicious
coffee
and
after
she
had
finished
her
solitary
meal
patty
felt
better
able
to
cope
with
whatever
might
be
awaiting
her
but
apparently
nothing
awaited
her
it
was
about
ten
and
as
luncheon
was
announced
for
one
patty
wondered
what
she
was
expected
to
do
in
the
meantime
she
asked
molly
where
miss
elizabeth
fleming
was
laws
miss
said
molly
rolling
her
eyes
do
make
no
attempt
for
to
see
her
she
writin
a
novel
and
she
up
in
her
den
on
the
fourth
floor
we
do
even
call
her
to
her
meals
if
she
wants
to
come
she
comes
and
if
she
do
i
takes
a
few
things
up
and
sets
outside
her
door
oh
said
patty
with
great
interest
ca
you
speak
to
people
when
they
writing
novels
indade
no
miss
it
spiles
the
whole
thing
and
they
has
to
begin
all
over
again
if
a
word
is
spoken
to
them
i
think
that
wonderful
said
patty
much
impressed
and
i
just
crazy
to
see
my
cousin
elizabeth
and
ruth
where
is
she
miss
ruth
she
at
her
school
miss
around
on
the
next
block
she
be
home
at
one
and
then
you
see
her
now
why
do
ye
go
and
lie
down
and
rest
yerself
but
i
not
tired
said
patty
i
just
want
to
get
started
get
to
living
here
you
know
ca
i
go
into
the
library
and
look
at
some
of
the
books
yes
miss
sure
if
there
nobody
there
i
shlip
up
an
peep
molly
went
softly
and
patty
followed
on
tiptoe
it
seemed
strange
to
be
so
quiet
for
at
villa
rosa
everybody
seemed
to
try
to
make
all
the
noise
possible
you
can
go
in
said
molly
after
her
peep
nobody
there
but
the
chairs
is
all
settin
in
rows
so
i
guess
a
club
or
somethin
is
comin
but
go
in
miss
dear
an
amuse
yerself
so
patty
went
in
the
library
which
was
a
large
back
room
on
the
main
floor
it
has
been
said
that
a
house
without
a
library
is
like
a
body
without
a
soul
and
surely
the
library
was
the
soul
of
the
fleming
home
it
was
a
beautiful
room
built
out
behind
the
rest
of
the
house
with
a
large
skylight
of
stained
glass
and
a
wide
bay
window
whose
cushioned
seats
looked
very
attractive
patty
sat
down
and
looked
about
her
the
room
was
furnished
with
many
bookcases
several
small
desks
and
tables
and
a
number
of
whose
broad
arms
held
books
and
magazines
patty
began
at
once
to
examine
the
titles
of
the
books
and
was
delighted
to
find
a
large
case
full
of
children
books
containing
all
her
old
favorites
and
many
more
that
she
had
never
read
she
selected
the
water
babies
which
belonged
to
the
latter
class
and
curling
herself
up
on
the
was
soon
absorbed
in
the
story
a
little
later
she
heard
the
street
door
open
and
shut
and
then
cousin
barbara
whisked
hurriedly
into
the
library
she
did
see
patty
at
first
but
sat
down
at
a
desk
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
hastily
sorted
over
some
papers
to
pigs
she
murmured
to
twelve
write
paper
on
choctaw
costumes
twelve
to
one
attend
dinner
why
it
time
for
the
pigs
now
will
i
interfere
with
the
pigs
if
i
stay
here
cousin
barbara
said
patty
curious
to
see
the
animals
appear
but
not
wishing
to
intrude
what
are
you
there
patty
yes
you
may
stay
if
you
like
but
make
no
noise
or
disturbance
of
any
kind
i
wo
said
patty
and
then
miss
barbara
proceeded
to
ignore
her
small
cousin
presence
and
in
her
hurried
way
prepared
her
books
and
papers
and
laid
small
slips
of
paper
and
pencils
in
various
chairs
and
occasionally
jotted
down
something
in
a
small
which
she
took
from
her
pocket
soon
several
strange
ladies
were
ushered
into
the
room
by
molly
and
patty
was
much
disappointed
by
the
fact
that
they
brought
no
pigs
with
them
and
was
just
hoping
that
they
would
arrive
later
when
the
meeting
was
called
to
order
and
she
learned
that
it
was
a
committee
from
the
town
improvement
association
to
consider
ways
and
means
for
the
amelioration
of
the
general
condition
of
the
common
pig
patty
thought
this
was
very
funny
and
wanted
to
laugh
when
the
ladies
discussed
it
seriously
and
with
great
enthusiasm
sometimes
several
talked
at
once
and
then
cousin
barbara
rapped
on
her
desk
with
a
little
hammer
and
they
began
all
over
again
at
eleven
they
all
went
away
and
cousin
barbara
whipped
out
her
packets
of
papers
once
more
then
she
selected
several
books
from
the
shelves
and
sat
down
to
write
presently
she
looked
up
bewildered
can
i
help
you
cousin
barbara
said
patty
eager
to
be
of
assistance
no
yes
said
her
cousin
yes
if
you
will
please
hand
me
the
encyclopedia
the
one
labeled
cho
patty
easily
found
the
desired
volume
and
carried
it
to
her
cousin
who
said
thank
you
and
then
scribbled
away
as
fast
as
she
could
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
now
she
said
thrusting
her
papers
in
her
desk
i
must
go
to
the
bootblacks
dinner
and
hastily
putting
on
her
jacket
and
gloves
she
had
kept
on
her
hat
she
flew
out
of
the
room
and
almost
instantly
the
street
door
closed
behind
her
then
patty
resumed
her
book
and
read
until
one
when
a
great
gong
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
announced
luncheon
delighted
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
family
at
last
patty
skipped
aunt
hester
was
in
the
and
greeted
her
niece
cordially
well
my
dear
she
said
i
hope
you
found
something
to
amuse
you
this
morning
if
you
wish
you
may
go
to
school
with
ruth
ah

she
comes
now
ruth
this
is
patty
fairfield
my
brother
child
from
richmond
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
said
patty
pleasantly
cousin
tom
told
me
you
were
here
and
i
hope
we
shall
be
good
friends
i
hope
so
said
ruth
a
little
awkwardly
for
she
was
a
trifle
confused
by
the
graceful
elegance
of
patty
manner
ruth
fleming
was
a
thin
slip
of
a
girl
with
a
very
pale
face
large
gray
eyes
and
light
brown
hair
which
was
smoothly
brushed
back
and
tightly
braided
she
wore
a
gray
dress
and
her
whole
effect
was
plain
and
colorless
her
face
was
pure
and
intellectual
but
so
calm
and
expressionless
that
patty
wondered
if
she
ever
laughed
aloud
and
if
she
ever
enjoyed
herself
very
much
in
any
way
ruth
took
her
place
at
the
table
without
another
word
and
patty
sat
down
beside
her
determined
to
make
her
say
something
if
she
had
to
pinch
her
but
just
then
cousin
elizabeth
came
in
and
patty
rose
to
greet
her
miss
elizabeth
fleming
was
a
large
handsome
woman
with
black
hair
and
snapping
black
eyes
and
such
a
winning
smile
that
patty
liked
her
at
once
well
patty
cousin
have
you
come
at
last
she
said
i
been
waiting
for
you
several
years
and
i
very
glad
to
see
you
she
gave
patty
an
affectionate
caress
and
kept
on
talking
as
she
seated
herself
at
the
table
patty
afterwards
discovered
that
cousin
elizabeth
always
kept
on
talking
no
matter
what
happened
or
who
else
was
talking
at
the
time
yes
she
said

all
wanted

our
southern
cousin

now
that
i
have
seen
you
i
think

delightful
mother

been
the
hatefullest

a
blue
satin
sofa

she
would
move
nor
she
would
say
a
word
i
declare

lost
all
patience

patty

the
heroine
of
my
new
novel
said
cousin
elizabeth
and
she
is
lovely
but
so
intractable
you
would
believe
how
sulky
and
stupid
she
gets
at
times
ah
barbara
as
her
sister
bustled
into
the
room
and
dropped
into
a
chair
at
the
table
how
are
the
bootblacks
oh
they
lovely
said
barbara
they
ate
all
the
dinner
and
then
stole
the
forks

of
them

ca

said
cousin
elizabeth
very
decidedly
she

and
if
we
have
time
we
look
in
at
the
library
when
luncheon
was
over
they
all
flew
away
on
their
respective
errands
and
cousin
elizabeth
told
patty
to
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
and
meet
her
in
the
in
ten
minutes
chapter
x
patty
pranks
somehow
the
time
passed
quickly
in
boston
in
fact
the
fleming
family
seemed
fairly
to
push
it
along
they
hurried
so
at
any
rate
they
wasted
none
of
it
and
after
a
few
weeks
patty
fell
into
the
ways
of
the
household
and
hurried
along
with
the
rest
indeed
she
had
to
do
so
or
be
left
behind
for
her
cousins
were
like
time
and
tide
and
waited
for
no
man
or
little
girl
either
she
went
to
school
with
ruth
but
found
herself
far
behind
the
new
england
girl
in
her
studies
so
she
took
her
place
in
a
lower
class
and
ruth
kindly
helped
her
with
her
lessons
at
home
patty
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
ruth
she
had
never
seen
a
girl
like
her
before
of
course
ruth
was
pleasant
and
amiable
but
she
was
so
very
quiet
seldom
talked
and
almost
never
laughed
patty
joked
with
her
and
told
her
funny
stories
but
at
most
she
received
only
a
faint
smile
in
response
and
sometimes
a
blank
stare
she
wrote
to
her
father
ruth
is
the
queerest
girl
i
ever
saw
and
i
believe
she
is
all
out
of
proportion
she
studies
so
hard
that
she
has
crowded
all
the
fun
out
of
herself
you
know
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
and
i
verily
believe
ruth
is
the
dullest
girl
in
the
world
but
ruth
almost
always
won
the
prizes
offered
at
school
and
was
accounted
the
best
of
miss
goodman
pupils
patty
liked
the
school
and
she
liked
miss
goodman
the
principal
but
the
hours
from
nine
to
one
seemed
very
long
to
her
and
she
would
often
get
restless
and
mischievous
one
day
she
thought
she
would
clean
her
ink
well
ruth
shared
her
desk
and
as
the
ink
well
was
intended
for
the
use
of
both
it
was
a
one
and
chanced
to
be
full
of
ink
so
patty
must
need
find
something
to
hold
the
ink
while
she
washed
the
inkstand
not
having
anything
appropriate
she
made
a
cornucopia
of
a
sheet
of
stiff
she
turned
up
the
point
securely
poured
the
ink
in
and
folded
down
the
top
feeling
sure
that
she
could
get
the
ink
well
ready
before
the
ink
soaked
through
the
paper
ruth
saw
this
performance
and
a
look
of
grave
disapproval
was
on
her
face
but
as
communication
of
any
kind
during
school
hours
was
strictly
forbidden
she
made
no
sign
just
as
patty
had
completed
her
dangerous
little
bundle
and
held
it
in
her
hand
looking
at
it
admiringly
miss
carter
the
teacher
happened
to
notice
her
now
as
the
strict
discipline
of
the
school
prohibited
anything
which
was
not
directly
an
aid
to
education
miss
carter
felt
it
her
duty
to
confiscate
the
package
that
be
candy
and
that
certainly
did
not
pertain
to
school
work
patty
fairfield
said
she
in
a
commanding
voice
you
are
out
of
order
you
have
there
something
apart
from
your
school
duties
bring
it
to
me
at
once
but
miss
carter
began
patty
silence
not
a
word
hand
me
that
parcel
oh
miss
carter
i
ca
it
one
word
more
and
you
will
be
expelled
from
school
i
require
implicit
obedience
bring
me
that
parcel
as
there
was
really
nothing
else
to
do
patty
walked
up
to
miss
desk
gingerly
carrying
the
package
of
ink
she
knew
what
would
happen
if
miss
carter
took
it
but
she
had
tried
to
explain
and
as
she
was
not
allowed
to
do
so
she
could
help
feeling
that
the
result
would
serve
the
teacher
right
for
being
so
unreasonably
tyrannical
but
she
thought
she
would
attempt
one
more
warning
so
she
said
you
be
sorry
if
you
take
it
miss
carter
angry
at
what
she
considered
an
impertinent
threat
miss
carter
grasped
the
paper
of
ink
with
an
indignant
clutch
and
a
black
flood
streamed
over
her
hand
and
dress
and
spurted
out
in
various
directions
some
drops
flew
in
her
face
and
on
her
immaculate
white
collar
while
others
decorated
her
desk
and
papers
with
black
blots
the
pupils
who
had
watched
the
scene
with
interest
though
only
ruth
knew
what
was
in
the
cornucopia
were
at
the
calamity
and
sat
breathlessly
awaiting
the
explosion
of
miss
carter
wrath
but
a
drop
of
ink
rolled
down
that
lady
august
nose
and
involuntarily
she
put
up
her
hand
to
brush
it
away
this
produced
such
an
smudge
on
the
face
that
the
girls
burst
into
uncontrollable
laughter
and
the
unfortunate
teacher
rushed
out
of
the
room
patty
was
not
expelled
from
the
school
for
after
hearing
ruth
grave
and
carefully
exact
version
of
the
case
miss
goodman
decided
that
though
patty
was
blameworthy
yet
miss
carter
had
been
too
peremptory
in
her
orders
and
so
had
brought
the
trouble
upon
herself
patty
who
was
but
not
malicious
went
to
miss
carter
privately
and
made
her
peace
with
the
irate
lady
but
it
was
several
days
before
the
ink
stains
entirely
disappeared
from
the
teacher
face
and
as
for
the
blots
on
the
desk
and
platform
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
were
there
yet
when
patty
told
about
the
ink
episode
at
home
aunt
hester
was
exceedingly
shocked
but
cousin
tom
said
patty
you
a
genius
what
made
you
think
of
wrapping
up
ink
in
paper
there
was
nowhere
else
to
put
it
cousin
tom
i
suppose
if
you
had
had
any
paper
you
would
have
dumped
it
into
your
pocket
eh
tom
said
his
sister
barbara
how
careless
you
are
in
your
diction
ink
one
can
only
dump
a
powdered
or
granulated
substance
by
the
way
i
joined
a
new
club
it
a
society
for
the
improvement
of
advertisers
english
and
we
work
in
such
a
novel
and
efficacious
way
miss
white
and
i
were
appointed
a
committee
to
go
through
the
shops
in
a
certain
district
and
call
attention
to
any
errors
which
we
noticed
on
signs
or
placards
well
we
went
into
a
large
dry
goods
house
and
the
first
thing
that
caught
my
eye
was
a
sign
swisses
cents
i
sent
for
the
advertising
manager
and
he
came
then
i
said
to
him
this
is
a
reliable
house
and
of
course
you
advertise
nothing
that
you
can
not
supply
a
swiss
is
a
native
of
switzerland
and
experience
has
taught
me
that
a
swiss
is
often
an
admirable
servant
especially
clever
as
a
cook
so
if
you
can
sell
me
a
swiss
for
cents
i
take
one
and
i
do
care
whether
he
is
dotted
or
not
the
man
looked
extremely
mortified
and
stammered
something
about
meaning
muslin
goods
sold
by
the
yard
said
i
you
mean
dotted
swiss
muslins
why
do
you
say
so
and
miss
white
and
i
stalked
out
of
the
shop
that
club
of
yours
is
a
good
thing
said
fleming
meditatively
i
hope
you
will
banish
the
signs
which
announce
blacked
inside
and
those
others
which
always
rouse
false
hopes
in
the
minds
of
people
who
have
lost
their
umbrellas
by
promising
recovered
while
you
wait
yes
we
will
and
we
going
to
do
away
with
those
atrocious
doggerel
rhymes
in
the
street
cars
and
substitute
real
poetry
it
will
cost
a
great
deal
to
get
it
written
but
we
have
funds
and
the
public
taste
must
be
elevated
the
work
of
such
clubs
as
this
and
constant
endeavors
towards
educational
or
literary
attainment
of
one
sort
or
another
engrossed
the
attention
of
the
whole
fleming
family
amusement
or
recreation
not
of
a
literary
nature
was
never
indulged
in
so
serious
were
they
in
their
aims
and
purposes
that
all
fun
was
crowded
out
and
to
patty
this
was
a
sad
state
of
affairs
indeed
as
she
wrote
to
her
father
the
worst
kind
of
misproportion
is
that
which
leaves
out
all
fun
and
jokes
and
laughing
and
i
going
to
play
a
joke
on
the
whole
family
if
i
can
think
of
a
good
one
just
to
stir
them
up
for
once
then
patty
tried
her
best
to
think
of
some
hoax
or
trick
that
would
be
harmless
and
yet
would
startle
all
the
flemings
out
of
their
usual
busy
routine
as
the
first
of
april
drew
near
she
did
think
of
a
plan
and
she
decided
that
april
fool
day
gave
her
a
legitimate
excuse
for
teasing
her
relatives
as
a
family
their
habits
were
most
methodical
meals
were
served
exactly
at
the
appointed
hours
and
every
one
appeared
in
the
as
if
by
magic
punctual
to
the
minute
breakfast
was
at
eight
and
patty
had
often
heard
cousin
elizabeth
say
that
she
always
woke
on
the
stroke
of
seven
none
of
the
others
woke
earlier
than
that
as
a
rule
and
rules
in
the
fleming
house
had
very
rare
exceptions
so
patty
decided
to
try
a
bold
scheme
which
was
nothing
less
than
to
set
everybody
clock
two
hours
ahead
on
the
morning
of
the
first
of
april
and
let
the
people
waken
to
find
they
had
apparently
overslept
she
could
not
have
managed
this
very
well
except
for
the
fact
that
cousin
tom
had
remarked
a
few
days
before
that
he
had
left
his
watch
at
a
jeweler
to
be
cleaned
and
was
carrying
an
old
one
which
was
very
unreliable
so
mischievous
patty
woke
very
early
on
the
morning
of
the
first
of
april
indeed
she
had
waked
several
times
during
the
night
so
anxious
was
she
for
the
success
of
her
trick
as
soon
as
the
dawn
made
it
light
enough
for
her
to
see
her
way
indistinctly
round
the
house
she
slipped
on
her
and
crept
softly
it
was
just
five
by
the
old
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
and
patty
opened
its
glass
door
and
pushed
the
hands
around
until
they
stood
at
seven
then
she
went
to
the
and
kitchen
and
changed
those
clocks
to
correspond
the
library
clock
was
harder
to
manage
for
it
was
a
and
she
had
to
stand
on
a
table
to
reach
it
but
patty
was
a
determined
little
girl
and
having
set
out
to
fool
the
family
she
was
not
to
be
baffled
by
small
obstacles
then
she
went
up
to
the
second
floor
and
into
her
aunt
hester
room
she
felt
a
little
bit
like
a
burglar
when
she
saw
the
dear
old
lady
peacefully
asleep
in
her
bed
but
it
was
only
the
work
of
a
moment
to
change
the
time
of
the
little
clock
that
ticked
softly
on
the
mantel
and
then
patty
slipped
into
the
next
room
cousin
elizabeth
watch
lay
on
her
and
as
it
was
a
little
just
like
patty
own
it
was
easy
to
turn
the
tiny
hands
two
hours
ahead
cousin
barbara
watch
was
under
her
pillow
but
as
the
sound
sleep
of
that
lady
was
proverbial
audacious
patty
slipped
her
hand
under
her
head
took
out
the
watch
changed
the
time
and
replaced
it
and
miss
barbara
fleming
slept
on
in
blissful
ignorance
patty
was
afraid
that
cousin
tom
would
spoil
the
whole
joke
but
she
knew
that
he
had
no
clock
in
his
room
and
only
awoke
when
his
mother
knocked
at
his
door
each
morning
she
hoped
that
in
this
case
he
would
look
at
his
watch
or
if
he
did
he
would
have
no
faith
in
the
uncertain
old
chronometer
he
was
carrying
at
present
and
anyway
it
would
be
believed
against
the
testimony
of
all
the
other
timepieces
in
the
house
last
of
all
she
slipped
up
to
the
servants
room
and
changed
the
time
of
their
alarm
clock
bridget
the
cook
and
molly
were
sleeping
each
in
a
narrow
bed
and
bridget
was
snoring
loud
enough
to
wake
them
both
but
she
did
then
patty
hurried
back
to
her
own
room
and
jumped
into
bed
again
to
await
results
ruth
had
no
clock
or
watch
she
seemed
to
get
up
at
the
right
time
by
instinct
and
patty
after
carefully
thinking
it
all
over
concluded
she
had
done
her
work
very
thoroughly
and
so
she
had
and
her
trick
was
a
great
success
of
course
the
alarm
clock
went
off
apparently
two
hours
late
bridget
woke
with
a
start
looked
at
the
clock
rubbed
her
eyes
and
looked
again
and
then
she
turned
to
molly
arrah
molly
she
cried
will
yez
luke
at
that
now
the
alarrum
is
jist
afther
goin
off
an
it
eight
whativer
will
happen
to
us
molly
jumped
up
in
great
excitement
and
the
two
maids
hastily
dressed
and
ran
of
course
it
was
really
only
six
but
as
the
sun
was
now
shining
brightly
they
had
no
thought
for
astronomical
calculations
and
besides
they
were
frightened
nearly
out
of
their
wits
such
a
thing
had
never
before
happened
in
the
fleming
household
as
no
one
was
astir
they
went
on
down
to
the
kitchen
corroborating
the
time
by
the
various
clocks
but
utterly
unable
so
understand
why
the
family
were
still
all
asleep
patty
heard
them
whispering
as
they
went
down
and
choking
with
laughter
she
prepared
to
wait
another
hour
for
more
fun
and
it
came
elizabeth
woke
just
at
seven
and
rising
glanced
as
usual
at
the
watch
on
the
nine
she
almost
screamed
running
to
her
sister
door
barbara
what
does
this
mean
it
nine
are
you
asleep
barbara
asleep
but
she
awoke
at
her
sister
call
and
drew
her
watch
from
beneath
the
pillow
it
is
she
cried
it
nine
what
shall
i
do
there
a
rehearsal
of
the
historical
tableaux
at
ten
and
i
have
to
make
three
wigs
before
i
go
but
even
that
is
as
important
as
my
engagement
wailed
elizabeth
who
was
splashing
her
face
with
water
i
have
to
be
at
the
authors
club
at
to
prepare
the
room
for
the
reception
at
eleven
and
nothing
can
be
done
until
i
get
there
and
i
must
do
several
errands
on
my
way
there
oh
it
be
nine
perhaps
my
watch
stopped
at
nine
last
evening
no
it
going
oh
how
unfortunate
i
am
mother
mother
she
called
but
fleming
was
already
up
and
came
through
the
hall
with
a
scared
face
girls
she
said
it
after
nine
and
tom
has
to
go
away
on
the
train
we
have
overslept
ourselves
i
should
think
we
had
began
elizabeth
but
fleming
had
already
gone
to
her
son
room
tom
tom
she
called
as
she
knocked
vigorously
at
the
door
get
up
it
after
nine
what
came
from
tom
room
accompanied
by
a
sudden
jump
out
onto
the
floor
ruth
had
heard
the
commotion
and
she
and
patty
each
appeared
at
their
doors
what
is
it
aunt
hester
asked
ruth
roused
at
last
patty
was
glad
to
see
to
some
degree
of
animation
why
ruthy
it
nine
we
have
all
overslept
hurry
children
you
be
late
to
school
well
such
a
commotion
as
there
was
everybody
compared
watches
and
clocks
and
exclaimed
in
wonderment
and
dismay
tom
said
that
his
watch
said
it
was
only
seven
but
of
course
as
he
had
said
it
did
keep
perfect
time
it
was
not
believed
when
all
the
others
said
nine
after
they
were
all
and
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
patty
remarked
quietly
april
fool
it
is
nine
at
all
it
only
seven
i
set
all
the
clocks
forward
two
hours
what
said
cousin
elizabeth
looking
as
if
she
would
annihilate
her
you
little
witch
you
dared
to
and
then
she
felt
such
a
relief
to
think
she
would
have
ample
time
to
keep
her
engagement
after
all
that
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
affair
struck
her
and
she
began
to
laugh
why
patty
fairfield
said
barbara
and
then
she
too
laughed
and
cousin
tom
when
he
found
he
could
catch
his
train
thought
it
all
the
best
joke
in
the
world
bridget
and
molly
enjoyed
it
the
most
of
all
perhaps
because
being
irish
they
had
a
greater
sense
of
humor
than
the
bostonians
but
all
agreed
that
patty
had
played
a
very
successful
april
fool
joke
on
them
all
except
ruth
she
did
see
any
fun
in
it
at
all
so
patty
gave
her
up
as
a
hopeless
case
chapter
xi
the
book
party
one
evening
as
they
all
sat
in
the
pleasant
library
cousin
elizabeth
announced
her
intention
of
giving
a
party
for
patty
i
am
afraid
she
said
kindly
that
you
find
it
dull
with
us
we
are
all
so
busy
with
our
club
work
and
study
that
we
have
really
neglected
your
entertainment
i
am
sorry
for
this
and
i
mean
to
give
you
more
youthful
pleasures
during
the
remainder
of
your
stay
with
us
patty
was
delighted
for
life
at
the
flemings
a
little
bit
humdrum
for
her
though
her
aunt
and
cousins
were
very
kind
whenever
they
had
time
to
remember
her
existence
they
all
fell
in
with
elizabeth
plan
and
began
to
discuss
what
kind
of
a
party
it
should
be
patty
was
secretly
much
amused
at
the
contrast
between
plans
for
a
party
at
villa
rosa
and
in
boston
nothing
was
said
about
decorations
and
the
supper
was
not
mentioned
except
when
cousin
elizabeth
said
she
would
order
some
cake
and
ice
cream
from
a
confectioner
and
as
to
dresses
well
seemed
never
to
be
even
thought
of
by
the
fleming
ladies
patty
wore
the
plainest
of
the
clothes
her
aunt
isabel
had
bought
for
her
but
even
those
were
far
finer
than
ruth
apparently
the
difference
was
not
noticed
for
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
what
any
one
wore
the
fleming
ladies
were
always
dressed
neatly
and
inconspicuously
but
patty
concluded
they
must
pick
their
dresses
off
of
trees
for
nothing
was
ever
said
about
dressmakers
or
purchase
of
materials
so
when
the
party
was
talked
about
all
discussion
was
concerning
the
entertainment
of
the
minds
of
the
young
guests
intellectual
games
were
proposed
and
even
ruth
grew
almost
excited
over
the
scheme
of
a
quotation
salad
but
cousin
elizabeth
said
games
are
not
enough
i
want
something
more
like
a
character
party
ah
i
have
it
let
us
ask
each
guest
to
represent
some
children
book
or
some
favorite
character
in
juvenile
literature
just
the
thing
exclaimed
barbara
eddie
can
be
lord
fauntleroy
eddie
was
a
neighbor
child
who
had
long
flaxen
curls
and
who
would
make
a
perfect
counterpart
of
the
pictures
of
fauntleroy
the
flemings
all
entered
into
the
plan
of
the
party
with
their
usual
enthusiasm
and
found
time
between
their
numerous
engagements
to
prepare
quite
a
programme
of
entertainment
a
platform
was
put
up
in
the
library
with
curtains
to
draw
in
front
of
it
and
as
this
was
done
very
easily
and
quickly
patty
rightly
judged
it
had
often
been
done
before
at
last
the
time
came
and
everything
was
in
readiness
the
party
was
to
begin
at
seven
and
promptly
at
that
hour
the
boys
and
girls
began
to
arrive
though
seemingly
so
indifferent
to
costumes
cousin
elizabeth
had
taken
much
interest
in
dressing
patty
and
ruth
for
this
occasion
and
patty
looked
very
sweet
and
pretty
arrayed
as
little
cousin
tom
had
chosen
this
character
for
her
and
had
helped
to
design
the
dress
it
was
of
course
the
garb
of
a
dainty
little
shepherdess
and
it
had
blue
panniers
over
a
quilted
white
satin
petticoat
and
a
black
velvet
bodice
laced
over
a
white
chemisette
then
patty
wore
a
broad
brimmed
hat
trimmed
with
roses
and
fluttering
ribbons
slippers
with
bright
buckles
and
a
crook
tied
with
blue
ribbons
added
to
the
quaint
effect
and
the
whole
costume
was
very
becoming
to
pretty
patty
ruth
looked
equally
well
though
in
a
very
different
way
she
represented
the
puritan
maiden
priscilla
who
though
not
a
juvenile
character
was
one
of
ruth
favorite
heroines
and
the
dress
suited
her
so
well
that
cousin
elizabeth
said
she
should
wear
it
a
straight
scant
gown
of
quaker
gray
silk
a
soft
white
mull
kerchief
folded
across
her
breast
and
a
white
muslin
cap
transformed
ruth
into
a
demure
little
puritan
maid
her
small
pale
face
and
quiet
eyes
suited
the
character
and
the
modest
garb
was
very
becoming
among
the
guests
were
represented
red
ridinghood
cinderella
little
boy
blue
simple
simon
and
many
other
personages
from
fairy
tales
or
mother
goose
melodies
then
there
were
characters
from
more
recent
books
such
as
little
women
alice
in
wonderland
master
skylark
and
even
arabella
and
araminta
who
were
dressed
exactly
alike
historical
characters
were
there
too
the
princess
in
the
tower
chatted
amiably
with
joan
of
arc
while
lady
jane
grey
compared
notes
with
pocahontas
some
of
the
children
wore
such
nondescript
costumes
that
it
was
difficult
to
guess
whom
they
intended
to
represent
after
all
had
arrived
the
programme
of
entertainment
was
begun
the
motley
crowd
was
seated
in
the
library
and
soon
the
curtains
in
front
of
the
platform
were
drawn
apart
revealing
a
table
on
which
was
a
large
gramophone
cousin
tom
manipulated
the
instrument
and
the
children
heard
orchestral
music
plantation
songs
comic
speeches
and
finally
the
exercises
of
a
district
school
which
made
them
all
laugh
after
this
several
of
the
guests
were
called
on
to
recite
or
to
sing
and
as
they
had
been
notified
beforehand
they
were
prepared
for
the
occasion
and
exerted
their
best
elocutionary
and
vocal
efforts
as
her
contribution
to
the
entertainment
patty
sang
several
of
robert
louis
stevenson
which
are
set
to
such
beautiful
music
and
ruth
recited
a
portion
of
the
courtship
of
miles
standish
then
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
soon
after
the
lights
in
the
room
were
all
turned
out
then
the
curtains
flew
open
again
disclosing
a
white
sheet
brightly
illuminated
from
behind
somebody
read
aloud
the
poem
by
richard
barham
about
the
knight
and
the
lady
while
a
shadow
pantomime
representing
the
action
of
the
ballad
was
shown
on
the
sheet
it
was
very
funny
cousin
elizabeth
was
the
lady
jane
who
was
tall
and
slim
while
the
part
of
sir
thomas
was
wonderfully
well
acted
by
cousin
tom
and
when
that
portly
old
gentleman
who
it
seems
was
a
naturalist
went
around
unearthing
his
worms
and
his
grubs
he
looked
very
funny
indeed
and
then
when
close
by
the
side
of
the
bank
he
espied
an
uncommon
fine
tadpole
remarkably
fat
he
stooped
and
he
thought
her
his
own
he
had
caught
her
got
hold
of
her
tail
and
to
land
almost
brought
her
when
he
plumped
head
and
heels
into
fifteen
feet
water
and
the
shadow
sir
thomas
ducked
suddenly
into
the
pond
and
a
very
real
splashing
was
heard
the
delighted
audience
fairly
shouted
with
laughter
and
then
when
the
funny
old
gardener
appeared
bringing
to
the
august
lady
jane
the
news
of
sir
thomas
fate
and
when
the
jocund
captain
mcbride
tried
to
console
the
weeping
lady
but
no
i
ca
tell
it
all
to
you
to
see
how
funny
it
all
was
you
will
have
to
read
the
ballad
in
the
ingoldsby
legends
for
yourself
when
that
was
over
sandwiches
ices
and
cakes
were
served
and
they
seemed
to
be
as
thoroughly
enjoyed
by
the
young
people
as
were
aunt
elaborate
feasts
though
by
contrast
it
seemed
to
patty
a
very
slight
repast
next
came
the
quotation
salad
which
was
ruth
pride
and
delight
cousin
elizabeth
passed
around
a
great
bowl
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
leaves
of
crisp
green
lettuce
they
were
however
made
of
tissue
paper
and
each
leaf
had
attached
to
it
a
strip
of
writing
paper
on
which
was
written
a
quotation
these
were
from
poems
or
historic
speeches
or
even
from
mother
goose
melodies
and
other
juvenile
classics
each
child
drew
out
three
leaves
and
endeavored
to
remember
or
guess
the
source
of
the
quotations
written
thereon
then
the
roll
was
called
and
all
who
could
give
their
three
answers
correctly
were
marked
one
hundred
after
this
the
unguessed
ones
were
read
aloud
and
whoever
could
answer
them
received
ten
more
on
his
or
her
score
for
each
perfect
answer
to
the
child
attaining
the
highest
score
a
prize
of
a
dictionary
of
quotations
was
to
be
awarded
patty
three
questions
were
easy
enough
one
was
his
cause
is
marching
on
another
was
twinkle
twinkle
little
bat
and
the
third
was
do
give
up
the
ship
she
could
place
all
three
but
when
the
more
difficult
ones
were
announced
she
found
that
she
knew
very
little
about
general
literature
ruth
however
could
tell
the
author
of
nearly
every
one
and
no
one
was
surprised
when
her
score
was
declared
the
highest
however
as
she
was
the
hostess
she
declined
to
accept
the
prize
and
it
was
given
to
the
guest
whose
score
stood
the
next
highest
other
intellectual
or
literary
games
were
played
and
at
eleven
the
children
were
sent
home
and
aunt
hester
bade
ruth
and
patty
go
to
bed
at
once
lest
they
should
not
feel
like
getting
up
at
the
usual
hour
the
next
morning
patty
heartily
thanked
cousin
elizabeth
for
taking
so
much
pains
to
make
the
party
a
pleasant
one
and
ran
away
to
bed
wondering
if
many
little
girls
had
such
clever
relatives
the
spring
flew
by
and
patty
could
scarcely
realize
that
she
had
been
in
boston
nearly
three
months
when
a
letter
came
from
barlow
her
mother
sister
at
whose
house
she
was
to
visit
next
my
dear
patty
her
aunt
grace
wrote
we
are
going
to
our
country
home
on
long
island
about
the
first
of
june
and
we
want
you
to
come
to
us
as
soon
as
we
get
settled
there
no
not
settled
we
never
that
but
as
soon
as
we
get
enough
things
straightened
out
to
live
with
our
is
called
so
you
may
prepare
yourself
to
see
a
family
that
lives
up
to
that
name
but
there
is
plenty
of
amusement
if
you
are
fond
of
boating
and
bathing
and
we
will
all
welcome
you
with
open
arms
and
glad
hearts
and
the
sooner
you
come
the
better
we
shall
like
it
your
cousins
bob
and
bumble
are
very
anxious
to
see
you
and
are
making
wonderful
plans
for
your
entertainment
so
come
as
soon
as
you
can
and
if
you
will
let
us
know
at
what
hour
to
expect
you
uncle
theodore
will
meet
you
at
the
grand
central
station
in
new
york
and
bring
you
over
to
us
at
long
island
your
loving
aunt
grace
barlow
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
said
ruth
when
she
heard
the
letter
read
i
like
to
have
you
stay
here
always
patty
was
surprised
at
this
for
ruth
had
always
seemed
so
cold
and
unresponsive
that
it
did
seem
as
if
she
had
any
affection
in
her
nature
the
other
members
of
the
fleming
family
echoed
ruth
sentiments
and
though
patty
felt
sure
their
expressions
were
honestly
meant
yet
she
thought
too
that
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
she
would
be
forgotten
in
the
rush
of
their
busy
life
one
morning
in
early
june
as
they
sat
at
the
patty
received
a
telegram
which
said
come
at
once
before
all
are
drowned
grand
central
five
helen
barlow
although
patty
did
know
it
helen
was
the
real
name
of
her
cousin
who
was
always
called
bumble
and
patty
at
the
import
of
this
message
read
it
aloud
asking
what
it
could
mean
the
fleming
family
were
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
barlows
and
could
give
no
clue
but
one
and
all
were
filled
with
consternation
at
the
peremptory
summons
cousin
tom
took
the
yellow
paper
and
perused
it
carefully
then
said
one
thing
is
clear
at
any
rate
patty
they
expect
you
to
be
at
the
grand
central
station
in
new
york
at
five
and
you
shall
be
there
for
i
take
you
myself
so
they
all
helped
with
the
packing
and
succeeded
in
getting
one
trunk
ready
for
patty
to
take
with
her
promising
to
send
her
other
belongings
after
her
a
few
days
later
with
hurried
and
a
promise
of
another
visit
to
boston
at
some
future
time
patty
went
away
with
cousin
tom
and
they
took
the
train
for
new
york
chapter
xii
the
patty
and
cousin
tom
reached
the
grand
central
station
in
new
york
about
six
and
leaving
the
train
went
in
search
of
any
member
of
the
barlow
family
who
might
be
there
to
meet
them
they
had
walked
a
dozen
steps
before
they
were
confronted
by
three
broadly
smiling
faces
these
faces
belonged
to
a
tall
large
man
with
his
arms
full
of
bundles
and
a
boy
and
girl
who
seemed
both
to
be
about
patty
own
age
you
patty
i
know
it
i
know
it
cried
the
girl
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
patty
neck
and
kissed
her
heartily
i
am
bumble
and
this
is
bob
my
twin
oh
i
so
glad
to
get
you
by
this
time
bob
was
shaking
patty
hand
vigorously
and
barlow
was
trying
to
squeeze
all
of
his
bundles
into
one
arm
that
he
might
have
a
hand
free
to
offer
his
niece
then
patty
introduced
cousin
tom
and
the
party
all
went
into
the
together
but
who
sent
me
that
telegram
and
who
is
helen
inquired
patty
as
she
walked
along
with
one
of
her
twin
cousins
clinging
to
either
arm
oh
that
me
said
bumble
my
real
name
helen
but
nobody
ever
calls
me
it
because
she
like
a
explained
bob
she
always
tumbling
about
and
knocking
into
people
and
she
so
buzzy
and
fat
yes
said
bumble
i
am
i
like
to
be
slim
and
graceful
like
you
but
i
not
so
i
just
put
up
with
myself
and
have
all
the
fun
i
can
barlow
gave
fleming
a
cordial
invitation
to
continue
his
journey
with
patty
and
spend
the
night
at
the
as
his
on
long
island
was
called
but
cousin
tom
declined
saying
he
had
business
in
new
york
but
patty
he
said
your
relatives
seem
to
be
in
no
immediate
danger
of
drowning
no
said
patty
who
was
consumed
with
curiosity
to
know
what
the
telegram
could
have
meant
drowning
exclaimed
barlow
what
are
you
talking
about
the
bathing
is
very
safe
at
our
place
there
really
no
danger
at
all
unless
one
is
positively
foolhardy
no
said
patty
but
my
telegram
said
oh
i
know
broke
in
bumble
papa
left
it
to
me
to
send
you
word
to
come
and
i
did
get
at
it
until
it
was
too
late
to
write
so
i
telegraphed
and
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
get
here
before
the
kittens
were
drowned
that
i
mentioned
it
to
make
you
hurry
up
kittens
exclaimed
patty
laughing
you
did
say
kittens
i
know
it
but
the
ten
words
gave
out
too
soon
i
just
had
room
to
get
in
that
we
meet
you
at
five
oh
the
kittens
are
such
dears
two
black
ones
and
a
white
one
and
a
spotted
one
the
white
one
is
the
prettiest
but
she
an
idiot
poor
thing
cousin
tom
was
relieved
to
learn
that
no
human
beings
were
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives
but
he
secretly
thought
that
patty
new
home
was
to
be
among
very
erratic
people
he
bade
his
small
cousin
with
real
regret
for
he
and
patty
had
become
firm
friends
during
her
boston
visit
after
fleming
had
left
them
barlow
picked
up
all
his
bundles
and
packages
and
telling
the
three
children
to
follow
him
he
stalked
away
at
a
rapid
pace
bob
took
patty
satchel
and
bumble
took
her
umbrella
then
they
each
grasped
her
arm
and
marched
her
along
after
their
father
you
see
explained
bob
dad
walks
so
very
fast
that
we
have
to
scurry
to
keep
him
in
sight
so
we
boost
you
along
it
only
be
a
minute
and
sure
enough
in
a
moment
barlow
stopped
at
a
and
turned
around
expecting
to
find
the
children
at
his
elbow
and
there
they
were
he
put
them
on
the
car
jumped
on
himself
and
they
all
went
over
to
the
ferry
a
ride
across
the
east
river
on
the
and
then
a
short
ride
in
the
cars
brought
them
to
the
station
of
sandy
cove
here
barlow
expected
his
own
carriage
to
be
awaiting
them
but
no
carriage
was
in
sight
as
it
was
growing
dusk
and
their
home
was
still
two
miles
distant
this
was
very
annoying
i
walk
over
home
and
bring
the
carriage
back
for
you
volunteered
bob
it
must
be
that
dil
has
forgotten
to
come
for
us
no
said
his
father
you
need
do
that
we
all
jog
along
together
and
probably
we
meet
dil
on
the
way
dil
is
the
man
who
takes
care
of
our
horse
said
bumble
as
they
walked
along
that
short
for
dilatory
and
we
call
him
that
he
so
slow
in
fact
we
never
know
whether
he
coming
for
us
or
not
and
apparently
this
time
dilatory
was
not
coming
for
the
travelers
walked
all
the
way
without
meeting
the
carriage
as
they
walked
up
the
path
patty
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
that
what
barlow
called
a
cottage
was
in
reality
a
large
house
wide
verandas
ran
all
the
way
round
it
on
both
the
first
and
second
stories
and
magnificent
trees
waved
their
branches
around
and
over
it
this
is
the
patty
said
her
uncle
and
if
anything
quite
in
order
you
must
pardon
it
for
we
scarcely
settled
yet
and
have
had
time
to
get
everything
to
rights
and
your
aunt
grace
had
the
misfortune
to
sprain
her
ankle
yesterday
so
she
ca
attend
to
things
as
she
otherwise
would
but
whatever
you
want
just
you
come
straight
and
tell
your
uncle
teddy
and
you
shall
have
it
if
it
a
roc
egg
patty
laughed
for
she
well
knew
what
happened
once
when
a
roc
egg
was
asked
for
then
they
entered
the
main
front
door
and
patty
found
herself
in
a
wide
hall
that
ran
straight
through
the
house
with
a
door
at
either
end
there
were
large
rooms
on
both
sides
of
the
hall
and
following
her
uncle
into
one
of
these
rooms
which
was
the
or
general
of
the
family
patty
saw
a
remarkable
sight
in
a
large
armchair
sat
a
lady
with
an
ottoman
in
front
of
her
on
which
her
bandaged
foot
was
resting
on
a
pillow
she
was
reading
a
book
which
she
laid
down
as
she
heard
people
approaching
and
over
her
head
she
held
an
open
umbrella
this
was
a
wise
precaution
for
a
drenching
rain
was
pouring
on
the
umbrella
and
water
dripped
steadily
from
the
ends
of
its
ribs
why
grace
exclaimed
barlow
what
are
you
doing
what
has
happened
the
tank
must
have
burst
returned
his
wife
placidly
but
fortunately
i
had
this
umbrella
by
me
so
i
opened
it
and
as
you
see
i
am
scarcely
wet
at
all
is
this
patty
come
here
my
dear
i
am
your
aunt
grace
your
mother
sister
and
i
am
prepared
to
love
my
little
niece
very
much
patty
returned
very
willingly
her
aunt
loving
caress
and
the
two
nestled
together
under
the
big
umbrella
while
bob
and
bumble
laughed
at
the
funny
picture
they
made
uncle
ted
had
hastily
dropped
all
his
bundles
on
the
hall
table
and
had
run
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
the
tank
i
have
a
sprained
ankle
patty
said
her
aunt
by
way
of
explanation
of
her
predicament
and
i
ca
move
a
step
so
i
keep
a
cane
near
me
to
knock
on
the
floor
when
i
want
anybody
to
fetch
me
things
but
the
cane
got
mislaid
somehow
so
i
had
this
umbrella
in
its
place
and
was
it
fortunate
for
when
the
water
began
to
drip
down
i
just
put
up
the
umbrella
and
protected
myself
perfectly
the
only
trouble
was
i
could
close
it
to
knock
on
the
floor
without
getting
myself
drenched
so
as
i
had
an
interesting
book
i
just
waited
patiently
for
somebody
to
come
the
servants
have
gone
on
an
excursion
and
nan
is
away
too
so
there
was
no
one
to
knock
for
except
old
dilatory
and
he
would
have
heard
me
anyway
now
bob
if
you
get
another
umbrella
to
hold
over
yourself
while
you
move
me
to
dryer
quarters
i
be
truly
grateful
take
mine
said
patty
running
to
fetch
it
and
then
she
held
her
open
umbrella
over
bob
while
he
wheeled
his
mother
chair
across
the
hall
and
into
the
bumble
moved
the
ottoman
at
the
same
time
and
though
she
meant
to
be
very
careful
she
bumped
the
wounded
foot
terribly
when
going
over
the
but
barlow
pretended
it
did
hurt
her
and
thanked
the
children
lovingly
for
their
assistance
now
bob
she
said
run
and
help
your
father
i
suppose
he
up
in
the
investigating
the
source
of
that
waterfall
tell
him
he
better
send
dil
for
a
plumber
at
once
and
bumble
you
go
and
see
if
cook
has
returned
yet
for
if
not
i
do
know
when
we
get
any
dinner
patty
dear
take
off
your
hat
and
jacket
and
then
come
and
sit
here
by
me
and
we
have
a
little
talk
you
remind
me
very
much
of
your
mother
at
your
age
do
you
remember
her
at
all
no
aunt
grace
i
wish
i
could
but
she
died
when
i
was
only
three
you
know
i
have
a
beautiful
picture
of
her
have
you
you
must
show
it
to
me
when
your
trunks
come
you
are
like
your
mother
in
form
and
feature
and
i
hope
your
disposition
is
like
hers
she
was
the
loveliest
woman
i
ever
knew
so
sweet
and
gentle
and
so
unselfish
i
think
you
look
like
her
picture
aunt
grace
said
patty
gazing
earnestly
at
her
aunt
oh
no
child
she
was
a
hundred
times
more
beautiful
than
i
and
she
was
so
neat
and
dainty
and
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
i
was
the
of
the
family
and
i
sorry
to
say
my
children
seem
to
have
inherited
my
traits
of
character
they
are
so
careless
forgetful
and
unsystematic
but
they
dear
sweet
children
and
i
hope
patty
you
will
learn
to
love
your
barlow
cousins
i
do
need
to
learn
aunt
grace
i
love
them
already
bob
is
such
a
frank
pleasant
boy
and
bumble
is
a
dear
so
witty
and
bright
yes
they
are
intelligent
and
if
you
will
be
patient
with
our
shortcomings
i
think
we
will
be
very
happy
together
and
our
household
at
present
contains
another
member
nan
allen
who
is
visiting
here
is
a
neighbor
of
ours
in
philadelphia
and
though
several
years
older
than
you
she
is
a
most
charming
young
woman
and
i
sure
you
will
like
her
gracious
how
the
water
is
pouring
down
in
the
yet
i
wish
i
could
get
up
on
my
feet
run
patty
and
find
your
uncle
ted
and
ask
him
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
although
unacquainted
with
the
house
patty
ran
and
through
various
rooms
but
without
finding
her
uncle
anxious
to
do
her
aunt
bidding
she
ran
on
up
to
the
third
story
and
in
a
large
attic
room
she
found
her
uncle
standing
before
a
large
bookcase
eagerly
reading
a
volume
which
he
held
in
his
hands
what
about
the
water
uncle
ted
said
patty
yes
in
a
minute
i
going
to
attend
to
it
i
so
surprised
to
find
all
these
books
here
we
rented
this
cottage
furnished
you
know
and
i
have
been
up
here
before
i
no
idea
these
books
were
here
yes
see
about
the
water
at
once
patty
went
with
her
uncle
to
what
he
called
the
and
there
barlow
discovered
that
the
leak
was
in
a
supply
pipe
which
could
easily
be
shut
off
this
he
did
and
the
downpour
was
immediately
stopped
although
no
water
could
be
drawn
through
the
house
until
the
plumbers
should
come
and
repair
the
pipes
ted
said
barlow
as
her
husband
and
patty
returned
i
believe
hopalong
will
be
home
in
time
to
cook
dinner
so
suppose
we
have
a
supper
it
getting
late
and
patty
must
be
nearly
starved
after
her
journey
from
boston
all
right
said
uncle
ted
cheerily
is
there
anything
in
the
house
to
eat
where
bumble
go
and
hunt
her
up
please
and
tell
her
i
want
her
and
did
you
get
the
cheese
and
fruit
as
i
asked
you
to
yes
i
bought
out
the
whole
market
and
carried
it
all
home
with
me
very
well
then
we
wo
starve
now
wheel
me
into
the
and
i
see
what
we
have
on
hand
just
then
bob
and
bumble
appeared
each
carrying
two
kittens
and
these
four
sprawling
bits
of
animal
life
were
deposited
in
barlow
lap
while
patty
was
called
upon
to
admire
them
they
are
very
cunning
said
she
stroking
them
rather
gingerly
for
they
seemed
very
small
and
frail
oh
you
ca
hurt
them
said
bob
see
pick
up
this
way
and
he
grasped
one
by
the
back
of
its
neck
and
held
it
sprawling
in
the
air
no
hold
one
this
way
said
bumble
cuddling
a
little
ball
of
fur
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
but
mumsey
i
awful
hungry
are
we
going
to
have
any
dinner
where
hopalong
she
gone
on
the
excursion
my
dear
poor
thing
she
works
so
hard
glad
for
her
to
have
a
little
outing
h
she
gets
one
about
twice
a
week
said
bob
hopalong
the
cook
patty
we
call
her
that
she
is
very
lively
and
she
just
shuffles
about
but
she
a
old
thing
and
such
a
good
cook
here
children
take
this
flock
of
cats
said
barlow
and
soon
have
something
to
eat
cook
or
no
cook
bumble
gathered
up
the
kittens
beginning
with
the
white
one
this
is
the
idiot
she
said
but
is
it
a
pretty
cat
you
can
see
only
one
eye
is
open
and
she
has
such
a
general
air
of
stupidity
she
might
turn
out
to
be
the
smartest
of
the
lot
said
patty
i
wish
i
could
keep
her
and
see
but
dad
says
they
must
all
be
drowned
i
neglected
the
last
kitten
i
had
and
did
feed
her
regularly
so
the
poor
thing
died
daddy
if
you
let
me
keep
this
one
i
never
forget
to
feed
her
honest
i
wo
please
let
me
keep
just
this
one
and
bumble
rubbed
the
furry
ball
on
her
father
cheek
well
take
them
away
now
and
we
see
about
it
said
her
father
and
bumble
danced
off
with
the
kittens
feeling
almost
sure
that
she
had
gained
her
point
then
bob
and
his
father
moved
barlow
with
her
chair
and
footstool
out
to
the
i
do
know
what
there
is
myself
she
said
but
we
forage
in
the
sideboard
and
pantry
and
see
the
foraging
resulted
in
a
pair
of
cold
roasted
ducks
plenty
of
and
a
i
sorry
there
is
any
bread
said
barlow
apologetically
i
told
hopalong
to
order
it
as
she
went
by
the
baker
but
i
fear
she
forgot
it
never
mind
said
bob
i
do
care
much
for
bread
anyhow
do
you
patty
mother
here
a
lot
of
cold
potatoes
ca
you
make
a
salad
yes
indeed
said
barlow
so
the
children
brought
the
ingredients
and
a
fine
salad
was
soon
concocted
while
this
was
going
on
miss
allen
came
running
in
oh
she
exclaimed
i
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
we
been
out
sailing
and
i
an
appetite
who
is
this
pretty
child
this
is
patty
fairfield
said
bumble
my
cousin
from
the
south
oh
yes
of
course
i
knew
you
expected
her
how
do
you
do
patty
i
very
glad
to
see
you
i
am
nan
allen
and
i
want
you
to
like
me
better
than
you
do
any
of
the
barlows
do
you
hear
yes
said
patty
but
i
wait
until
i
see
if
you
like
me
miss
allen
was
a
very
pretty
young
lady
of
about
twenty
with
sparkling
black
eyes
and
a
lot
of
curly
golden
hair
which
she
wore
massed
high
on
her
head
she
was
extremely
vivacious
and
patty
liked
her
at
once
then
bumble
set
the
silver
basket
on
the
table
and
nan
brought
a
pile
of
plates
and
everybody
helped
himself
or
herself
to
such
viands
as
they
wished
there
was
much
laughter
and
gay
talk
and
patty
enjoyed
the
informal
meal
immensely
chapter
xiii
music
why
do
you
call
this
the
asked
patty
there
no
piano
in
it
nor
any
musical
instrument
that
i
can
see
that
just
the
reason
why
replied
nan
i
christened
the
room
myself
and
i
called
it
the
because
it
has
anything
musical
in
it
i
get
so
tired
of
seeing
filled
with
pianos
and
banjos
and
mandolins
and
guitars
this
is
a
refreshing
change
and
besides
when
we
want
music
we
can
sing
then
wo
you
sing
now
said
patty
i
like
to
hear
you
why
of
course
we
will
would
you
like
to
hear
some
of
our
original
songs
yes
indeed
do
you
make
songs
yourself
oh
we
always
make
our
own
songs
songs
are
ever
so
much
better
than
boughten
ones
they
fit
better
and
wear
longer
we
do
make
the
tunes
though
we
just
appropriate
those
first
we
sing
you
song
of
the
house
this
was
sung
to
the
air
of
the
kerry
dance
and
the
whole
family
joined
their
voices
with
nan
and
all
sang
with
great
spirit
come
oh
come
to
the
come
and
join
in
the
jolly
fun
that
begins
in
the
morning
early
and
continues
till
day
is
done
sailing
swimming
walking
riding
on
the
land
or
on
the
sea
at
the
biding
we
as
happy
as
we
can
be
oh
the
jollity
oh
the
gayety
just
come
down
and
see
chorus
come
oh
come
etc
sometimes
we
take
sandwiches
of
chick
and
go
off
on
a
merry
sometimes
we
in
hammocks
idly
swing
at
other
times
we
only
sit
and
chorus
come
oh
come
etc
that
beautiful
said
patty
when
they
had
finished
the
song
i
learn
the
words
and
then
i
can
sing
it
with
you
indeed
you
must
said
nan
and
now
i
sing
you
the
song
of
the
barlow
family
they
wo
sing
it
themselves
but
when
you
learn
it
you
and
i
can
warble
it
together
sing
a
song
of
barlows
a
family
full
of
fun
a
father
and
a
mother
a
daughter
and
a
son
when
the
door
is
open
hear
the
family
sing
all
the
people
passing
by
run
like
anything
it
a
base
libel
said
uncle
ted
we
sing
beautifully
and
except
that
bumble
flats
and
bob
has
no
ear
there
is
a
flaw
in
our
singing
the
evening
passed
merrily
by
and
when
it
was
bedtime
bumble
showed
patty
to
her
room
when
patty
found
that
a
large
front
room
on
the
second
floor
had
been
allotted
to
her
she
expressed
a
fear
lest
she
might
be
inconveniencing
some
one
else
by
taking
one
of
the
choice
rooms
of
the
house
not
a
bit
said
bumble
nan
has
the
because
she
likes
it
better
and
the
house
is
so
big
there
are
plenty
of
rooms
anyway
of
course
if
a
lot
of
company
comes
we
may
ask
you
to
give
up
this
and
take
a
smaller
room
but
you
would
mind
that
would
you
no
indeed
said
patty
i
move
out
at
any
time
then
bumble
kissed
her
cousin
and
went
away
patty
trunk
had
been
placed
in
her
room
and
she
found
that
some
one
had
kindly
unfastened
its
straps
and
clasps
so
she
had
only
to
unlock
it
she
unpacked
her
clothes
and
hung
up
her
dresses
in
the
wardrobe
and
cupboard
and
put
things
neatly
away
in
the
she
placed
her
mother
picture
on
a
small
table
and
looking
at
it
critically
she
concluded
that
it
was
like
aunt
grace
but
much
prettier
after
this
patty
looked
round
the
great
room
with
much
interest
it
seemed
to
contain
a
perfect
of
furniture
there
were
three
and
a
huge
with
two
bowls
and
pitchers
on
it
there
were
several
large
easy
chairs
and
an
old
haircloth
sofa
there
were
small
tables
and
bookcases
and
a
cabinet
filled
with
but
and
patty
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
there
was
no
bed
when
this
fact
dawned
upon
her
she
concluded
that
one
of
the
bookcases
or
bureaus
must
be
a
she
tried
to
open
them
but
the
and
the
proved
themselves
to
be
really
what
they
seemed
then
she
looked
for
a
bed
concealed
in
an
alcove
or
an
anteroom
but
the
curtains
hid
only
windows
and
the
doors
opened
into
ordinary
closets
patty
even
looked
in
the
fireplace
and
up
the
chimney
but
she
was
gradually
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
bed
at
her
disposal
and
that
she
must
either
report
this
fact
to
some
member
of
the
family
or
sit
up
all
night
as
it
was
now
late
she
hesitated
to
trouble
anybody
about
the
matter
and
thought
she
would
rather
manage
without
a
bed
she
did
think
of
asking
bumble
to
let
her
share
her
room
but
she
know
where
her
cousin
room
was
and
too
there
might
be
only
a
single
bed
in
it
so
patty
decided
to
try
the
old
sofa
as
she
had
no
pillow
or
she
rolled
up
a
dress
to
put
under
her
head
and
pinned
two
skirts
together
for
a
coverlet
but
the
old
haircloth
scratched
her
bare
feet
and
poor
patty
soon
jumped
up
and
sought
another
she
cuddled
up
in
a
big
armchair
which
was
soft
and
warm
and
there
she
soon
fell
asleep
but
later
she
awoke
so
stiff
from
her
cramped
position
that
she
could
scarcely
move
so
then
she
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
slept
there
the
rest
of
the
night
next
morning
she
dressed
herself
and
went
at
about
eight
but
nobody
was
in
sight
so
patty
went
out
on
the
veranda
and
watched
the
waves
as
they
came
rolling
and
tumbling
up
on
the
beach
then
with
a
view
to
exploring
her
new
home
she
walked
round
the
house
this
brought
her
to
the
kitchen
and
through
the
window
she
saw
a
fat
old
black
woman
raking
rigorously
at
the
range
dis
yer
stove
make
me
lose
my
patty
heard
her
murmur
and
she
felt
sure
she
was
listening
to

aunt
grace
had
been
carried
by
her
husband
and
son
and
was
already
in
her
place
at
the
table
she
called
patty
to
her
and
kissed
her
affectionately
and
asked
her
if
she
slept
well
patty
hesitated
a
moment
then
breaking
into
a
merry
laugh
she
said
why
auntie
grace
i
sleep
very
well
for
i
had
any
bed
what
exclaimed
her
aunt
in
horror
why
patty
i
ordered
a
little
brass
bed
sent
from
philadelphia
purposely
for
you
and
it
arrived
yesterday
morning
i
told
dil
to
put
it
up
in
your
room
and
i
told
eunice
to
see
that
it
was
properly
made
but
i
confess
i
did
forget
to
ask
if
my
orders
had
been
carried
out
and
i
suppose
they
were
you
poor
child
how
did
you
manage
why
did
you
tell
us
well
i
did
notice
it
until
quite
late
said
patty
i
was
so
busy
putting
my
clothes
and
things
away
that
i
never
thought
of
anything
else
at
the
time
and
anyway
i
did
mind
for
one
night
just
then
bumble
came
in
and
when
she
heard
about
patty
experience
she
looked
astounded
why
said
she
i
took
patty
to
her
room
myself
and
i
never
noticed
that
there
was
no
bed
there
you
a
goosey
said
her
father
but
never
mind
patty
you
shall
have
two
beds
to
make
up
for
it
i
promise
you
that
do
believe
him
cried
nan
gayly
as
she
ran
into
the
i
do
know
what
uncle
ted
is
saying
to
you
but
he
wo
do
it
he
never
kept
a
promise
in
his
life
promise
me
began
uncle
ted
and
then
they
all
joined
in
and
sang
oh
promise
me
that
some
day
you
and
i
will
take
a
piece
of
huckleberry
pie
some
deviled
eggs
and
strawberry
ice
cream
and
have
a
picnic
down
by
yonder
stream
and
then
we
wander
through
the
fields
afar
and
take
a
ride
upon
a
trolley
car
but
we
come
home
again
in
time
for
tea
oh
promise
me
oh
promise
the
last
refrain
rang
out
with
a
prolonged
wail
that
seemed
to
patty
the
funniest
thing
she
had
ever
heard
and
she
fairly
shouted
with
laughter
oh
dear
you
are
the
funniest
family
she
exclaimed
i
think
i
shall
stay
here
six
months
instead
of
three
chapter
xiv
a
funny
family
patty
was
right
when
she
called
the
barlows
a
funny
family
for
their
spirits
were
irrepressible
and
each
day
from
morning
till
night
was
filled
with
jokes
and
absurdities
accompanied
or
followed
by
gales
of
laughter
but
they
were
heedless
forgetful
people
and
the
whole
household
showed
an
utter
lack
of
systematic
management
nothing
was
ever
to
be
found
in
its
place
meals
were
served
at
any
hour
when
old
hopalong
got
them
ready
sometimes
the
market
orders
were
neglected
and
there
was
almost
nothing
to
eat
and
then
again
there
was
such
an
overstock
that
much
had
to
be
wasted
the
children
were
allowed
to
do
exactly
as
they
chose
and
were
never
reproved
but
if
their
own
mischief
led
them
into
misfortune
or
their
pranks
turned
out
disastrously
they
were
expected
to
stand
the
consequences
bravely
and
look
for
little
or
no
sympathy
from
their
elders
patty
had
not
been
at
the
many
days
before
she
discovered
that
its
proportion
of
order
and
regularity
was
entirely
too
small
to
be
sure
in
the
fleming
family
it
had
been
too
large
but
she
thought
there
must
be
a
happy
medium
a
state
of
things
whereby
one
could
expect
the
ordinary
events
of
daily
life
to
come
in
due
course
without
however
living
as
if
by
clockwork
you
see
patty
was
becoming
a
very
wise
little
girl
for
she
was
profiting
by
her
varied
experiences
and
trying
to
learn
the
best
way
to
take
care
of
her
father
house
and
make
it
a
real
home
for
him
sometimes
she
felt
this
responsibility
very
greatly
and
longed
for
some
motherly
housewifely
friend
to
talk
with
about
it
but
aunt
grace
though
loving
and
affectionate
was
no
help
in
such
matters
nonsense
child
she
would
say
do
worry
about
your
housekeeping
why
the
house
will
keep
itself
if
you
let
it
alone
and
you
too
young
to
be
bothered
with
a
weight
of
domestic
care
anyway
now
run
off
and
play
with
bob
and
bumble
go
for
a
row
or
a
drive
and
let
the
breeze
blow
all
such
worries
out
of
your
little
noddle
so
patty
ran
away
and
played
with
her
cousins
and
they
did
have
jolly
good
times
there
were
so
many
nice
things
to
do
fishing
sailing
bathing
boating
driving
golf
tennis
and
all
sorts
of
outdoor
amusements
were
at
their
disposal
the
barlow
twins
nan
allen
and
patty
made
a
gay
quartette
and
if
they
desired
a
larger
party
there
were
plenty
of
neighbors
ready
to
join
in
their
fun
one
warm
afternoon
patty
and
bumble
sat
in
a
hammock
swung
under
the
trees
while
bob
sprawled
on
the
grass
near
them
girls
said
he
come
on
let
go
for
a
swim
the
smiths
and
the
enfields
just
went
down
towards
the
and
there
be
a
jolly
crowd
in
the
water
all
right
let
go
replied
his
sister
where
nan
she
in
the
house
somewhere
said
patty
i
go
find
her
patty
ran
into
the
house
and
looked
in
at
the
door
as
a
beginning
of
her
search
but
there
she
saw
such
a
startling
sight
that
she
stood
spellbound
unable
to
go
any
further
at
the
sat
a
person
whose
head
was
entirely
bald
not
a
spear
of
hair
was
anywhere
visible
on
the
bare
scalp
and
the
round
head
was
smooth
and
shiny
as
a
then
the
head
turned
round
and
faced
patty
with
rolling
eyes
and
a
weird
grimace
but
patty
looked
so
astounded
and
frightened
that
the
face
broke
into
a
reassuring
smile
and
nan
voice
said
why
patty
do
be
scared
it
only
i
did
you
know
i
wore
a
wig
there
it
is
on
that
chair
and
sure
enough
there
was
nan
mop
of
frizzed
flaxen
hair
hanging
on
a
but
said
patty
coming
nearer
and
still
unable
quite
to
comprehend
it
all
why
do
you
have
any
hair
yourself
well
you
see
said
nan
as
she
sealed
and
addressed
the
letter
she
had
been
writing
i
had
typhoid
fever
just
before
i
left
home
and
my
hair
came
out
so
that
i
had
to
have
it
all
shaved
off
so
now
i
am
wearing
a
wig
until
it
grows
again
but
it
is
so
warm
i
took
my
wig
off
for
a
few
moments
to
rest
my
head
patty
examined
the
wig
with
great
interest
i
think
it
wonderful
she
said
is
it
just
like
your
own
hair
was
no
indeed
i
wanted
a
change
my
own
hair
is
very
dark
almost
black
and
perfectly
straight
so
i
bought
this
flaxie
frizzle
wig
for
a
change
becoming
do
you
think
so
i
have
a
red
wig
too
of
short
curly
auburn
hair
sometimes
i
wear
that
patty
watched
nan
curiously
as
she
put
the
wig
on
securing
it
to
her
head
by
invisible
springs
i
never
saw
anybody
with
a
wig
before
she
said
and
it
surprises
me
so
but
i
came
to
ask
you
to
go
swimming
with
us
ca
do
it
said
nan
i
have
two
more
letters
to
write
and
then
going
driving
with
the
perrys
they
to
call
for
me
at
four
and
it
after
three
now
you
have
to
go
without
me
this
time
all
right
said
patty
backing
out
of
the
room
for
her
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
the
wonderful
wig
then
she
rejoined
her
cousins
and
they
all
ran
to
the
they
had
a
fine
bath
and
were
about
ready
to
come
out
of
the
water
when
nan
appeared
she
was
dressed
in
a
fresh
white
piqué
suit
with
blue
ribbons
at
her
throat
and
belt
and
was
looking
very
pretty
but
decidedly
disappointed
she
walked
out
to
the
end
of
the
narrow
wooden
pier
and
the
swimmers
came
up
to
talk
to
her
patty
did
swim
very
well
as
yet
but
she
was
learning
and
uncle
ted
and
bob
said
she
was
getting
along
finely
i
thought
you
were
going
out
with
the
perrys
cried
bumble
i
was
said
nan
but
they
did
come
i
been
dressed
and
waiting
for
them
half
an
hour
then
i
looked
again
at
the
note
they
sent
me
and
i
made
a
mistake
it
they
asked
me
to
go
so
i
came
down
here
and
i
wish
i
was
in
the
water
with
you
come
on
in
said
bob
too
much
trouble
to
get
into
my
do
do
it
said
bumble
we
coming
out
now
anyway
but
the
water
is
fine
is
it
patty
glorious
gurgled
patty
as
she
floundered
about
in
her
frantic
endeavors
to
swim
suddenly
nan
snatched
off
her
wig
and
dropped
it
down
on
the
dock
then
with
dramatic
gestures
she
wrung
her
hands
waved
them
above
her
head
and
cried
out
in
agonized
tones
i
am
desperate
no
longer
can
i
bear
this
sad
and
weary
life
i
end
it
apparently
in
the
last
stages
of
despair
she
strode
to
the
end
of
the
dock
and
threw
herself
headlong
into
the
water
patty
was
aghast
but
bob
and
bumble
were
accustomed
to
nan
mad
tricks
and
they
shouted
with
laughter
in
a
moment
the
bald
head
reappeared
above
the
water
for
nan
could
dive
and
swim
wonderfully
well
i
afraid
my
dress
will
get
wet
she
said
but
when
i
saw
you
all
having
such
fun
i
just
could
help
jumping
in
crazy
nan
said
bumble
you
spoiled
your
clean
dress
and
you
swim
with
your
shoes
on
anyway

well
said
nan
regretfully
and
they
my
best
shoes
too
but
i
do
care
i
get
a
bath
and
have
some
fun
later
on
the
four
young
people
much
refreshed
and
exhilarated
assembled
in
the
to
wait
for
dinner
aunt
grace
whose
sprained
ankle

and
who

hungry
exclaimed
bob

placidly

bob
coming
back
from
a
fruitless
quest

empty
and

nan
peering
into

said
patty
who
dearly
loved
to
pretend
i
make
the
tea
so
she
pretended
to
measure
out
some
tea
from
the
caddy
and
put
it
in
the
teapot
then
she
poured
imaginary
water
from
the
teakettle
upon
it
and
covered
the
teapot
tightly
with
the
cosey
after
allowing
it
a
little
time
to
draw
she
pretended
to
pour
it
into
cups
in
which
bumble
had
already
placed
imaginary
and
bits
of
lemon
bob
offered
his
services
as
waiter
and
passed
the
cups
to
his
mother
and
nan
and
also
to
imaginary
guests
who
he
pretended
were
sitting
on
the
chairs
and
sofa

tea

delicious
said
aunt

stirring
in
her
empty

spoon

patty

empty
cupful

biscuit
bumble
said
bob
and
his
sister
carried
around
the
empty
while
the
guests
helped
themselves
to
nothing
uncle
ted
came
in
in
the
midst
of
the
tea
joke
and
drank
several
cups
of
air
until
patty
finally
peeped
into
the
teapot
and
said
you
all
have
to
stop
for

any
tea

bob
carried

after

announced
her
willingness

fondly
and
said
she

a
dear
little
helper
and
they
would

only
too
glad
to

use
of
her
services
but
the
day
passed
by
and
nothing
was
done
everybody
went
for
a
swim
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
nan
went
driving
and
patty
and
the
twins
were
invited
to
a
neighbor
to
play
tennis
then
in
the
evening
they
all
went
for
a
moonlight
sail
after
they
returned
patty
ventured
to
remind
her
procrastinating
relatives
that
there
was
very
little
time
left
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
various
entertainments
they

suggested

grasshoppers

bob

invention

set
old
dil

a
place
for
a
tent

bumble
and
after
we
buy
the
things
wo
you
take
us
to
the
zoo
to
see
the
baby
hippopotamus
but
said
patty
i
think
we
ought
to
stay
at
home
and
help
aunt
grace
no
no
said
her
aunt
there
nothing
much
to
do
i
get
somebody
in
to
help
hopalong
make
cakes
and
jellies
and
we
can
leave
the
house
decorations
until
thursday
yes
that
will
be
best
said
nan
for
i
going
over
to
montauk
point
for
the
day
but
i
help
all
day
thursday
we
all
work
with
more
enthusiasm
when
the
day
of
the
party
comes
said
aunt
grace
and
now
run
along
to
bed
all
of
you
next
day
the
family
rose
late
and
breakfast
was
much
later
so
that
it
was
noon
before
they
started
for
new
york
then
bob
proposed
that
they
go
to
the
zoo
first
and
do
the
shopping
afterwards
this
they
did
and
the
result
was
that
as
the
animals
were
so
interesting
after
they
had
seen
them
all
it
was
too
late
to
go
to
the
shops
whew
i
no
idea
it
was
so
late
said
uncle
ted
looking
at
his
watch
but
never
mind
we
go
home
now
and
i
telegraph
early
in
the
morning
and
the
tent
and
lanterns
can
be
sent
over
at
once
and
we
can
easily
get
them
put
up
in
time
when
they
reached
home
they
found
aunt
grace
entertaining
some
friends
who
had
come
to
spend
the
day
they
were
delightful
people
and
aunt
grace
had
found
them
so
absorbing
that
she
had
entirely
forgotten
to
send
for
an
assistant
to
prepare
dainties
for
the
party
but
nobody
seemed
to
mind
and
patty
concluded
it
was
not
her
place
to
comment
on
the
way
things
were
going
at
least
not
to
the
people
themselves
but
when
she
wrote
that
night
to
her
father
she
said
i
glad
you
did
describe
my
aunts
to
me
but
let
me
discover
their
traits
for
myself
for
really
i
never
would
have
believed
a
family
act
like
the
barlows
they
are
out
of
proportion
way
but
after
all
i
ca
help
loving
them
for
they
are
such
dear
kind
people
and
they
to
do
right
only
they
never
do
anything
but
as
the
next
day
was
thursday
and
some
things
to
be
done
everybody
began
to
hustle
and
bustle
and
fly
around
generally
uncle
ted
sent
to
new
york
by
a
special
messenger
for
a
tent
and
a
lot
of
lanterns
and
gay
bunting
and
succeeded
in
getting
them
soon
after
noon
then
he
and
bob
and
old
dil
put
the
tent
up
and
hung
the
lanterns
along
the
veranda
and
among
the
trees
nan
drove
all
around
the
country
trying
to
find
a
cook
to
assist
hopalong
but
as
none
was
to
be
found
aunt
grace
had
to
go
down
to
the
kitchen
and
make
some
of
the
cakes
herself
nan
and
bumble
made
sandwiches
and
squeezed
lemons
and
somehow
the
time
slipped
away
until
it
was
four
and
the
house
was
not
yet
decorated
and
the
ice
cream
had
arrived
from
new
york
nan
you
and
patty
fix
the
flowers
and
i
take
the
trap
and
fly
down
to
the
station
and
see
if
the
ice
cream
is
there
said
bumble
who
was
very
warm
and
tired
but
who
kindly
offered
to
do
the
most
unpleasant
errand
all
right
said
nan
and
bumble
drove
off
in
a
hurry
that
morning
the
girls
had
gathered
a
quantity
of
wild
flowers
and
vines
for
decorations
and
bumble
said
she
had
put
them
in
water
but
nobody
knew
where
so
they
hunted
in
every
place
they
could
think
of
but
to
no
avail
bob
helped
them
and
they
searched
the
kitchen
the
cellar
and
even
the
barn
but
no
flowers
could
they
find
so
as
it
was
nearly
five
they
gave
it
up
and
ran
to
dress
for
the
party
and
then
patty
discovered
that
the
bath
tub
was
filled
with
the
missing
flowers
at
risk
of
being
caught
by
the
guests
in
their
attire
nan
and
patty
flew
and
hastily
arranged
the
flowers
as
well
as
they
could
and
then
returned
to
make
their
toilettes
it
was
now
after
five
but
fortunately
no
guests
had
yet
arrived
nobody
will
come
before
five
anyway
said
nan
as
they
hastily
scrambled
into
their
frocks
they
may
replied
patty
there
comes
somebody
now
oh
it
bumble
bumble
came
in
panting
and
breathless
i
had
to
bring
the
ice
cream
home
with
me
she
said
there
was
no
one
else
to
bring
it
from
the
station
was
it
lucky
i
went
over
yes
indeed
said
patty
and
now
bumble
dear
rest
yourself
a
little
nan
and
i
will
receive
the
guests
aunt
grace
is
still
in
the
kitchen
yes
said
bumble
but
the
table
is
set
yet
we
ought
to
get
out
the
plates
and
things
eunice
is
frosting
cakes
and
she
ca
do
it
well
i
can
do
it
now
said
patty
i
all
ready
if
you
just
tie
my
sash
nobody
is
here
yet
so
i
may
have
a
few
minutes
at
least
but
when
patty
reached
the
the
scene
was
appalling
in
the
hurry
nobody
had
found
time
to
clear
away
the
luncheon
dishes
and
the
extension
table
must
be
made
longer
and
really
there
was
an
hour
work
there
for
somebody
patty
called
bob
to
help
her
as
everybody
else
was
so
busy
and
the
boy
left
what
he
was
doing
and
came
to
his
assistance
it
was
six
before
everything
was
in
readiness
and
the
family
gathered
on
the
veranda
to
rest
themselves
and
await
their
guests
seems
to
me
they
getting
pretty
fashionable
said
bob
it
an
hour
after
the
time
set
and
nobody
here
yet
well
it
a
warm
day
said
aunt
grace
fanning
herself
and
nobody
likes
to
start
out
early
in
the
afternoon
but
after
another
passed
and
still
nobody
came
they
all
began
to
think
it
rather
queer
perhaps
they
boycotted
us
said
uncle
ted
and
do
mean
to
come
at
all
i
should
think
the
perrys
would
be
here
by
this
time
said
nan
i
meant
to
speak
to
them
about
it
yesterday
and
ask
them
to
be
sure
to
come
early
but
i
forgot
it
did
we
invite
the
harlands
said
bob
i
ca
think
whether
we
did
or
not
said
bumble
i
know
we
were
undecided
about
them
but
we
asked
the
graysons
and
here
they
come
now
well
i
glad
somebody
coming
said
nan
but
no
they
turning
in
they
driving
by
sure
enough
said
bob
mean
old
things
if
they
could
come
they
might
at
least
have
sent
regrets
here
are
the
stanton
girls
anyway
said
patty
as
two
young
ladies
came
walking
towards
them
elsie
and
mildred
stanton
came
up
to
the
group
on
the
veranda
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
air
said
mildred
you
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
have
a
why
we
are
said
bumble
if
anybody
comes
to
it
i
glad
arrived
anyway
come
in
but
we
were
invited
said
elsie
a
little
stiffly
we
came
over
on
an
errand
indeed
you
were
invited
said
bumble
warmly
do
you
suppose
i
leave
you
out
my
dearest
chums
but
really
did
you
get
an
invitation
how
funny
they
were
sent
out
on
tuesday
no
said
elsie
but
if
it
was
a
mistake
and
you
meant
to
invite
us
it
all
right
but
we
did
know
it
you
see
so
we
not
in
party
frocks
as
nobody
else
is
here
yet
i
think
we
run
home
and
dress
up
a
bit
and
then
come
back
again
all
right
said
bumble
knowing
her
guests
would
feel
more
comfortable
if
suitably
dressed
and
they
lived
near
by
skip
along
girls
and
hurry
back
after
they
had
gone
it
was
nearly
seven
and
nobody
else
appeared
great
consternation
was
felt
by
all
and
suddenly
patty
said
who
mailed
those
invitations
bumble
did
said
bob
no
i
did
said
bumble
i
thought
you
attended
to
it
why
bob
i
asked
you
particularly
to
look
after
them
i
did
hear
you
said
bob
do
you
suppose
but
patty
had
already
run
into
the
house
and
returned
with
her
hands
full
of
the
invitations
to
the
party
oh
groaned
everybody
quite
overcome
by
the
calamity
nan
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
there
only
one
thing
to
do
she
said
we
must
go
around
and
pick
up
as
many
guests
as
we
can
in
a
hurry
it
wo
do
to
let
all
this
nice
go
to
waste
bob
and
i
will
take
the
runabout
and
bumble
you
and
patty
can
take
the
trap
and
we
scour
the
country
as
far
as
possible
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
turnouts
dashed
away
in
opposite
directions
and
all
the
neighbors
were
bidden
to
come
to
the
at
once
much
laughter
and
fun
was
caused
by
the
sudden
and
peremptory
invitations
which
were
for
the
most
part
gladly
accepted
when
the
guests
finally
arrived
the
party
was
a
grand
success
though
of
much
smaller
proportions
than
was
originally
intended
the
veranda
was
a
fine
place
for
dancing
and
games
and
supper
served
in
the
tent
was
very
novel
and
attractive
as
nan
said
after
the
party
was
over
it
was
just
perfect
except
that
we
could
invite
the
ones
that
lived
at
any
distance
but
uncle
ted
said
never
mind
we
have
another
party
and
invite
them
and
i
see
to
mailing
the
invitations
myself
oh
ho
laughed
nan
then
we
need
even
get
ready
for
the
party
for
you
never
remember
to
post
them
at
which
uncle
ted
called
her
a
saucy
minx
and
sent
them
all
to
bed
chapter
xvi
unbounded
hospitality
although
life
at
the
was
full
of
irritating
incidents
and
even
serious
disappointments
which
were
caused
by
the
general
forgetfulness
and
careless
habits
of
the
family
yet
there
were
also
many
pleasures
and
patty
enjoyed
the
summer
very
much
and
became
warmly
attached
to
her
relatives
uncle
ted
was
kindness
itself
and
aunt
grace
was
very
loving
and
affectionate
towards
her
motherless
niece
bob
and
bumble
were
trumps
and
nan
was
so
irresistibly
funny
that
she
made
merry
jokes
of
what
would
otherwise
have
been
real
troubles
the
days
flew
by
and
patty
thought
she
had
never
known
a
summer
to
pass
so
rapidly
she
almost
lived
out
of
doors
for
uncle
ted
said
he
was
determined
to
transform
the
little
boston
bluestocking
into
a
wild
indian
and
so
patty
had
become
browned
by
the
sun
and
her
rowing
and
swimming
had
developed
a
fine
amount
of
muscle
but
as
we
are
always
more
or
less
influenced
by
the
character
of
those
about
us
patty
had
also
imbibed
much
of
the
spirit
of
the
family
and
lived
as
if
the
pleasure
of
the
present
moment
were
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
be
careful
my
patty
her
father
wrote
to
her
you
do
not
send
me
letters
as
regularly
as
you
used
to
and
what
you
tell
me
sometimes
sounds
as
if
you
thought
it
no
harm
to
break
a
promise
or
to
fail
to
keep
an
engagement
you
have
made
you
know
i
want
you
to
by
your
experiences
and
imitate
only
the
best
qualities
of
those
about
you
not
going
to
have
my
house
run
on
any
plan
miss
pattikins
so
if
you
expect
to
secure
the
position
of
housekeeper
you
must
be
prepared
to
keep
things
right
up
to
the
mark
we
will
have
an
exact
proportion
of
methodical
regularity
without
having
so
much
of
it
that
it
will
be
a
bugbear
oh
i
tell
you
my
lady
our
home
is
going
to
be
a
veritable
paradise
on
earth
and
i
am
impatient
to
get
it
started
you
have
only
one
more
visit
to
make
and
then
i
will
come
and
kidnap
my
own
daughter
and
carry
her
off
with
me
for
a
christmas
present
what
a
dear
wise
father
i
got
mused
patty
after
reading
this
letter
and
how
he
understands
everything
even
without
my
telling
him
i
try
not
to
grow
heedless
and
though
it
hard
to
be
any
other
way
in
this
house
one
morning
in
august
barlow
said
to
her
husband
ted
you
know
the
carletons
are
coming
this
afternoon
to
stay
several
days
and
i
want
you
to
go
over
to
the
three
train
to
meet
them
do
forget
it
will
you
and
you
have
to
engage
a
stage
to
bring
them
over
for
there
be
and
carleton
and
four
children
and
perhaps
a
nurse
i
do
know
where
we
going
to
put
them
all
to
sleep
but
we
must
stow
them
away
somehow
patty
would
you
mind
giving
up
your
room
for
a
time
not
a
bit
aunt
grace
put
me
wherever
you
like
that
a
good
girl
well
suppose
you
sleep
with
bumble
she
has
only
a
bed
but
if
you
do
quarrel
you
wo
fall
out
all
right
said
patty
i
move
my
things
at
once
very
well
my
dear
then
we
can
give
your
room
to
and
carleton
and
gertrude
will
have
to
room
with
nan
and
the
other
children
must
go
up
in
the
third
story
no
harry
can
sleep
with
bob
i
declare
i
did
think
it
would
crowd
us
so
when
i
invited
the
whole
family
but
it
will
be
only
for
a
week
and
we
get
along
somehow
many
hands
make
light
work
and
with
much
flurrying
and
scurrying
the
rooms
were
made
ready
for
the
expected
guests
about
noon
the
expressman
came
bringing
two
trunks
events
cast
their
shadows
before
said
uncle
ted
here
come
the
wardrobes
of
the
carleton
family
they
must
have
sent
them
by
express
yesterday
said
aunt
grace
dear
me
how
forehanded
some
people
are
i
wish
i
had
been
born
that
way
but
when
i
go
anywhere
i
take
my
trunk
with
me
and
then
i
always
leave
it
behind
they
all
laughed
at
this
paradoxical
statement
and
uncle
ted
said
where
you
differ
from
an
elephant
then
as
the
trunks
were
set
out
on
the
veranda
he
exclaimed
good
gracious
my
dear
these
are
the
trunks
they
marked
both
of
them
echoed
barlow
why
who
can
that
be
the
carletons
have
borrowed
other
people
trunks
to
come
with
suggested
nan
not
they
returned
aunt
grace
they
the
most
particular
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
why
kate
carleton
would
as
soon
think
of
borrowing
a
house
as
a
trunk
no
these
belong
to
somebody
else
and
i
know
who
it
is
it
fanny
todd
before
i
left
home
i
asked
her
to
come
down
here
the
first
week
in
august
and
i
never
thought
of
it
again
from
that
day
to
this
but
i
should
think
she
would
have
written
why
mamma
said
bumble
there
was
a
letter
came
for
you
from
philadelphia
a
day
or
two
ago
did
you
get
it
i
saw
it
on
the
hall
table
no
i
did
get
it
run
and
look
for
it
child
but
the
letter
could
be
found
so
barlow
assumed
that
it
was
from
her
friend
miss
todd
and
concluded
that
that
lady
would
shortly
arrive
where
we
put
her
to
sleep
she
queried
every
room
is
already
filled
she
can
have
my
room
said
bob
and
harry
carleton
and
i
will
sleep
out
in
the
tent
he
a
good
fellow
and
he
wo
mind
but
his
mother
will
said
barlow
she
so
fussy
about
such
things
still
i
ca
see
anything
else
to
do
if
it
does
rain
i
suppose
you
be
all
right
the
carletons
came
first
and
barlow
welcomed
them
with
a
gracious
hospitality
which
gave
no
hint
of
the
flurried
turmoil
of
preparation
that
had
been
going
on
all
day
gertrude
carleton
the
eldest
daughter
was
one
of
those
beings
who
look
as
if
they
ought
always
to
be
kept
in
a
bandbox
she
had
a
languishing
sort
of
air
and
after
a
few
moments
conversation
with
her
bumble
excused
herself
and
slyly
nudged
patty
to
come
outside
with
her
she
took
her
cousin
and
said
patsy
i
sure
that
girl
wo
like
to
room
with
nan
she
looks
as
if
she
always
had
a
whole
suite
of
rooms
to
herself
parlor
and
all
i
can
imagine
her
fainting
away
when
nan
takes
off
her
wig
now
how
would
it
do
to
give
miss
gertrude
our
room
and
you
and
i
go
in
with
nan
i
bunk
on
the
sofa
i
do
mind
a
bit
neither
do
i
declared
patty
yes
let
give
your
room
to
the
lady
gertrude
and
never
mind
asking
nan
about
it
either
so
the
girls
changed
things
around
in
short
order
and
then
went
and
conducted
gertrude
to
her
room
aunt
grace
gave
a
little
surprised
smile
but
with
her
usual
tact
said
nothing
harry
carleton
seemed
to
be
a
very
nice
boy
and
he
went
off
to
the
tent
with
bob
in
great
glee
while
the
two
little
carleton
children
and
their
nurse
were
installed
in
rooms
on
the
third
floor
before
the
guests
had
reappeared
a
carriage
drove
up
to
the
veranda
and
a
lady
and
gentleman
got
out
oh
thought
barlow
as
she
went
to
greet
them
who
fanny
brought
with
her
how
do
you
do
grace
cried
sprightly
miss
todd
i
come
you
see
though
i
did
get
the
telegram
i
asked
you
to
send
me
and
i
brought
harris
as
i
said
i
would
i
know
you
welcome
him
gladly
after
what
i
told
you
fanny
said
barlow
deeming
it
best
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
matter
i
did
get
your
letter
at
least
they
say
it
came
but
somehow
it
was
lost
before
i
read
it
and
it
ca
be
found
however
it
matter
and
i
am
very
glad
to
welcome
harris
in
any
capacity
then
greet
me
as
miss
todd
future
husband
said
harris
smiling
and
barlow
gave
him
a
hearty
welcome
and
congratulations
at
the
same
time
but
harris
was
a
new
problem
although
he
intended
to
remain
only
one
night
yet
a
room
must
be
provided
for
him
and
poor
barlow
was
at
her
wits
end
but
it
was
at
her
wits
end
that
the
good
lady
oftenest
found
a
way
out
of
her
difficulties
and
after
a
glance
into
harris
merry
blue
eyes
she
felt
sure
she
could
ask
him
to
sleep
on
the
couch
in
the
without
offending
his
dignity
in
the
least
and
so
it
turned
out
that
the
was
filled
with
guests
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
they
all
had
a
merry
time
uncle
ted
was
in
his
element
and
he
provided
fun
for
the
children
and
entertainment
for
the
older
guests
until
even
languid
gertrude
was
stirred
to
enthusiasm
it
was
late
when
they
all
retired
and
after
barlow
had
insured
the
comfort
of
her
guests
and
her
children
she
lay
down
to
rest
and
fell
asleep
at
once
chapter
xvii
a
fire
although
harris
had
expressed
himself
satisfied
with
his
couch
in
the
yet
as
it
was
hard
and
narrow
his
slumbers
were
not
very
profound
and
at
two
in
the
morning
he
awoke
from
a
light
doze
and
began
to
sniff
in
the
darkness
i
believe
i
smell
fire
he
said
to
himself
he
jumped
up
and
ran
into
the
hall
where
he
found
the
whole
staircase
was
a
charred
and
smouldering
mass
ready
to
break
into
flame
at
any
moment
harris
was
a
man
of
quick
action
but
he
paused
a
moment
to
consider
he
could
go
up
the
stairs
they
were
ready
to
give
way
at
a
touch
he
dared
not
open
the
front
door
or
indeed
any
door
that
might
create
a
draught
which
would
fan
the
stairs
into
a
flame
so
he
decided
he
must
rouse
the
sleepers
and
then
jump
out
of
the
window
and
run
to
the
tent
to
get
the
assistance
of
the
two
boys
who
were
sleeping
there
being
a
stranger
in
the
house
he
knew
of
no
other
stairway
and
knew
nothing
of
the
servants
or
where
they
might
be
barlow
fire
mr
barlow
he
screamed
fire
carleton
fanny
but
no
one
answered
at
last
patty
was
wakened
by
his
voice
and
ran
out
in
the
upper
hall
the
draught
of
her
opening
door
started
the
flames
a
little
and
when
she
looked
over
the
banister
it
was
into
a
well
of
fire
before
she
could
say
a
word
harris
called
up
to
her
patty
he
said
keep
your
senses
and
help
all
you
can
i
think
the
fire
is
only
in
the
staircase
and
if
so
we
can
get
everybody
safely
out
of
their
own
windows
tell
this
to
your
uncle
and
then
tell
the
others
i
going
after
bob
harris
disappeared
and
patty
bravely
resisted
her
inclination
to
scream
instead
she
ran
into
her
uncle
room
and
shook
him
awake
saying
uncle
ted
the
stairs
are
all
burnt
up
but
it
does
matter
you
can
get
out
of
the
windows
then
she
ran
back
and
wakened
bumble
and
nan
saying
girls
the
house
is
on
fire
but
let
be
real
sensible
and
not
get
burned
up
put
on
your
and
then
we
must
go
and
tell
the
ethers
as
she
talked
patty
was
slipping
on
her
and
then
she
caught
up
her
mother
picture
and
wrapped
it
in
a
and
with
the
little
bundle
in
her
hand
she
ran
back
to
the
hall
where
she
met
uncle
ted
which
room
are
the
carletons
in
patty
she
told
him
and
then
bob
shouted
up
from
below
we
got
the
old
babcock
extinguisher
dad
and
we
making
it
tell
on
the
fire
ca
you
throw
on
some
water
up
there
and
tell
all
the
people
to
go
out
on
the
balconies
and
we
take
down
all
right
and
i
say
patty
get
my
camera
out
of
my
room
will
you
i
do
want
anything
to
happen
to
that
all
right
said
patty
and
she
ran
for
the
camera
in
bob
room
she
found
miss
todd
just
waking
up
get
up
miss
todd
she
cried
the
house
is
on
fire
and
your
harris
is
putting
it
out
and
he
says
for
you
to
jump
out
of
the
window
oh
screamed
miss
fanny
hopping
out
of
bed
and
rushing
wildly
around
the
room
which
window
any
window
said
patty
who
was
hunting
in
the
closet
for
the
camera
so
miss
todd
half
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
but
with
a
blind
intention
of
obeying
the
orders
of
her
fiancé
climbed
over
a
window
sill
and
jumped
out
as
a
veranda
ran
all
around
the
of
the
she
found
herself
standing
just
outside
her
window
on
a
very
substantial
balcony
and
feeling
decidedly
chilly
in
the
night
air
here
are
some
clothes
said
patty
grabbing
up
whatever
came
handy
and
putting
them
out
the
window
to
miss
todd
is
there
anything
you
want
saved
particularly
for
patty
had
taken
a
from
its
pillow
and
in
it
had
placed
the
bundle
containing
her
mother
picture
and
bob
camera
yes
said
miss
todd
that
book
of
poems
it
was
jim
first
gift
to
me
oh
and
my
hat
all
right
said
patty
and
she
put
the
book
in
her
bag
but
the
hat
being
large
and
feathery
she
put
on
her
head
then
patty
went
to
gertrude
carleton
room
she
found
that
fragile
bit
of
humanity
sleeping
peacefully
and
she
hated
to
startle
her
but
the
excitement
was
growing
greater
people
were
running
about
in
all
directions
and
the
flames
though
still
confined
to
the
staircase
were
liable
to
spread
further
at
any
moment
so
patty
decided
to
break
the
news
gently
to
the
frail
gertrude
and
she
touched
her
softly
on
the
shoulder
gertrude
dear
she
said
if
the
house
get
on
fire
what
would
you
want
to
save
most
my
shoes
said
gertrude
promptly
awake
and
alert
in
an
instant
here
they
are
she
reached
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
grasped
her
dainty
little
boots
which
she
gave
to
patty
very
well
said
patty
putting
them
in
her
bag
and
now
you
better
get
up
and
dress
for
the
house
may
get
on
fire
come
i
help
you
for
i
smell
smoke
now
where
are
you
going
with
your
hat
on
asked
gertrude
much
bewildered
but
still
making
an
expeditious
toilette
nowhere
said
patty
i
collecting
valuables
this
is
miss
todd
hat
i
must
go
now
when
you
ready
step
out
of
your
window
on
to
the
balcony
and
they
take
you
down
by
ladders
or
something
i
guess
patty
went
out
into
the
hall
and
found
that
the
fire
was
partly
under
control
uncle
ted
and
carleton
were
pouring
buckets
of
water
on
it
which
they
brought
from
the
bathroom
where
bumble
was
helping
fill
the
buckets
harris
and
the
two
boys
were
using
hand
grenades
an
old
fire
extinguisher
and
sundry
other
patented
means
of
putting
out
fires
there
was
much
yelling
of
orders
going
on
but
very
little
obeying
of
the
same
and
each
man
seemed
to
be
working
with
a
will
in
his
own
way
patty
went
into
her
aunt
grace
room
and
found
that
lady
dressed
in
her
best
attire
i
thought
i
put
on
this
gown
she
said
ted
says
we
all
be
saved
but
then
you
never
can
tell
how
a
fire
may
break
out
somewhere
else
and
burn
up
all
your
wardrobe
so
i
have
this
anyway
and
it
my
best
gown
ted
told
me
to
stay
in
this
room
and
not
move
until
he
came
after
me
is
the
fire
burning
the
hall
carpet
much
yes
quite
a
good
deal
but
they
spilled
so
much
water
on
it
that
all
wet
and
i
reckon
that
will
spoil
it
more
than
the
fire
but
aunt
grace
what
do
you
want
to
save
the
house
may
all
burn
up
you
know
and
i
trying
to
save
the
most
valuable
things
i
this
nearly
full
now
oh
what
a
good
idea
well
i
wish
you
put
in
that
photograph
album
and
my
set
of
coral
jewelry
and
my
and
please
get
the
box
of
old
letters
that
on
the
highest
shelf
in
that
cupboard
oh
and
here
uncle
ted
we
must
save
that
now
grace
said
uncle
ted
himself
appearing
in
the
doorway
the
fire
is
pretty
well
under
control
that
harris
is
a
good
fellow
and
no
mistake
but
as
the
flames
may
break
out
again
i
mean
to
put
you
out
of
harm
way
at
once
come
out
on
the
balcony
uncle
ted
had
a
great
coil
of
rope
in
his
arms
and
he
stepped
through
the
long
french
window
onto
the
balcony
and
aunt
grace
and
patty
followed
there
they
discovered
quite
a
party
already
assembled
and
such
costumes
as
they
wore
carleton
had
on
turkish
bedroom
slippers
and
she
wore
a
black
veil
tied
over
her
face
for
fear
of
smoke
she
had
wrapped
herself
in
a
large
quilt
and
somebody
had
tied
it
round
with
a
wide
sash
so
that
she
looked
like
a
queer
foreign
personage
of
some
sort
nan
in
her
hurry
had
fastened
her
wig
on
insecurely
and
had
since
lost
it
her
attire
was
an
old
ulster
of
uncle
ted
which
she
had
found
in
the
third
story
hall
when
she
ran
up
to
alarm
the
carleton
children
and
their
nurse
the
nurse
in
great
fright
had
pulled
down
portières
and
wrapped
them
round
herself
and
the
children
while
old
hopalong
had
shuffled
down
from
her
room
in
a
mackintosh
and
to
this
motley
crowd
came
aunt
grace
in
her
handsome
party
gown
and
patty
with
her
bag
of
treasures
hello
there
cried
uncle
ted
cheerily
the
danger
is
over
i
think
but
we
have
no
stairs
left
to
descend
upon
the
boys
are
bringing
ladders
however
and
i
think
with
care
we
can
all
get
down
safely
but
as
my
wife
sprained
ankle
is
scarcely
sound
enough
as
yet
to
trust
her
on
a
ladder
i
am
going
to
try
to
swing
her
down
in
this
hammock
patty
i
think
i
send
you
down
first
for
practice
all
right
uncle
ted
said
patty
and
still
clasping
her
bag
of
valuables
and
wearing
miss
todd
paris
hat
she
seated
herself
in
the
hammock
exactly
according
to
uncle
ted
directions
and
he
and
carleton
carefully
let
her
down
by
the
long
ropes
which
had
been
fastened
at
each
end
of
the
novel
elevator
harris
was
waiting
for
her
and
he
landed
her
safely
on
the
steps
of
the
lower
veranda
next
aunt
grace
was
lowered
and
after
that
another
hammock
was
rigged
and
all
of
the
ladies
were
taken
down
that
way
as
they
preferred
it
to
the
ladders
the
men
came
down
the
ladders
and
brought
the
little
children
in
their
arms
and
then
the
crowd
gathered
in
the
to
discuss
the
situation
the
men
concluded
that
the
fire
was
occasioned
by
a
mouse
having
nibbled
at
some
matches
which
were
kept
in
the
closet
under
the
stairs
as
the
shelves
and
walls
and
most
of
the
contents
of
the
closet
were
charred
it
was
assumed
that
the
fire
had
been
smouldering
for
some
hours
and
if
harris
had
not
discovered
it
as
soon
as
he
did
it
would
doubtless
have
been
followed
by
more
disastrous
consequences
the
stairs
from
the
first
to
the
second
floor
were
entirely
burned
away
and
except
that
the
walls
and
carpets
of
both
halls
were
smoked
and
discolored
no
other
harm
was
done
but
as
that
staircase
was
the
only
one
connecting
the
first
and
second
floors
the
victims
of
the
fire
found
themselves
in
the
peculiar
position
of
not
being
able
to
go
how
perfectly
ridiculous
exclaimed
aunt
grace
to
build
a
house
with
no
back
stairs
i
always
said
that
was
the
greatest
flaw
about
this
house
what
we
do
as
it
is
nearly
five
said
uncle
ted
i
propose
that
we
have
breakfast
and
consider
that
the
day
has
begun
then
perhaps
i
can
get
somebody
to
build
stairs
or
steps
of
some
kind
by
night
but
we
must
go
said
nan
who
had
covered
her
wigless
head
with
a
bandanna
kerchief
bound
round
like
a
turban
we
want
to
dress
properly
before
we
breakfast
and
we
want
to
finish
our
sleep
said
gertrude
carleton
i
not
going
to
get
up
at
five
and
stay
up
so
the
ladders
were
brought
in
from
outside
and
put
up
in
the
and
with
some
difficulty
everybody
was
brought
safely
again
with
the
procrastination
which
was
characteristic
of
the
barlow
household
the
new
stairs
failed
to
get
built
that
day
or
the
next
either
indeed
it
was
nearly
a
week
before
a
staircase
was
put
in
place
and
as
it
was
meant
to
be
only
temporary
it
was
made
of
plain
unpainted
wood
but
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
not
replaced
by
a
more
sightly
affair
until
after
the
barlows
had
returned
to
their
city
home
as
the
end
of
her
visit
at
the
drew
near
patty
felt
great
regret
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
merry
careless
crowd
she
invited
them
one
and
all
to
visit
her
when
she
should
be
established
in
her
own
home
and
she
promised
to
correspond
regularly
with
both
bumble
and
nan
where
is
it
you
going
said
bumble
i
never
can
remember
to
vernondale
answered
patty
a
town
in
new
jersey
but
it
nowhere
near
elmbridge
where
i
visited
the
clairs
i
believe
it
is
on
another
railroad
i
had
a
lovely
letter
from
aunt
alice
elliott
and
she
wants
me
to
come
the
first
week
in
september
she
says
uncle
charlie
will
meet
me
in
new
york
or
come
over
here
after
me
whichever
i
say
but
i
think
better
meet
him
in
new
york
so
when
the
day
came
uncle
ted
took
patty
over
to
new
york
and
bob
and
bumble
and
nan
went
too
and
it
was
a
group
of
very
young
people
who
met
elliott
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
but
bob
said
brace
up
girls
we
not
losing
our
patty
forever
she
spend
next
summer
with
us
at
the
and
by
that
time
well
have
beautiful
new
stairs
yes
said
bumble
and
she
can
visit
us
in
philadelphia
in
the
winter
too
then
after
many
fond
the
barlows
went
away
and
patty
was
left

her
uncle
smiling
as
to
your
cousins
they

four
specimens
of
young
america
who

be
seen
to
be
appreciated
frank
is
seventeen
and
marian
is
about
your
own
age
edith
is
ten
and
little
gilbert
is
six
they
are
all
moderately
good
and
moderately
pretty
but
on
the
whole
i
think
you
like
them
the
travelers
crossed
the
ferry
to
new
jersey
and
after
riding
nearly
an
hour
in
the
cars
they
reached
vernondale
elliott
carriage
met
them
at
the
railway
station
and
a
short
drive
brought
patty
to
her
new
home
the
house
was
a
large
one
surrounded
by
beautiful
grounds
with
fine
trees
carefully
kept
lawns
and
beds
of
bright
flowers
the
whole
family
had
assembled
on
the
veranda
to
greet
patty
and
as
the
carriage
came
up
the
driveway
there
was
a
great
waving
of
handkerchiefs
and
clapping
of
hands
and
shouts
of
here
she
comes
here
our
cousin
as
uncle
charlie
helped
patty
out
of
the
carriage
aunt
alice
was
the
first
to
clasp
her
in
her
arms
and
it
was
with
such
a
warm
loving
embrace
that
patty
felt
the
motherliness
of
it
and
loved
her
aunt
alice
at
once
next
she
was
introduced
to
grandma
elliott
and
the
dear
old
lady
beamed
through
her
spectacles
at
pretty
patty
and
willingly
agreed
to
adopt
her
as
a
really
truly
granddaughter
cousin
frank
proved
to
be
a
big
stalwart
lad
with
merry
eyes
and
a
boyish
smile
and
he
welcomed
patty
with
hearty
marian
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
fun
and
intelligence
written
all
over
her
bright
face
and
when
she
said
oh
patty
i
glad
you
come
patty
felt
sure
they
would
be
not
only
warm
friends
but
congenial
chums
old
edith
clasped
patty
hand
in
both
her
own
and
held
it
for
a
long
while
looking
up
in
her
cousin
face
with
an
occasional
smile
of
happy
confidence
last
came
little
gilbert
the
pet
of
the
household
and
a
lovely
boy
he
was
short
dark
curls
clustered
all
over
his
head
and
his
great
brown
eyes
gazed
at
patty
in
rapt
contemplation
i
glad
you
come
he
said
finally
and
i
love
you
and
i
try
to
be
good
all
the
time
you
here
that
right
my
boy
said
uncle
charlie
catching
gilbert
up
in
his
arms
and
setting
him
on
his
shoulder
and
after
patty
is
gone
what
then
then
i
see
about
it
said
the
child
gravely
and
they
all
laughed
at
the
carefully
considered
decision
then
aunt
alice
took
patty
up
to
her
room
and
as
they
went
through
the
halls
patty
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
beautiful
house
in
her
life
it
was
as
large
as
the
clairs
house
but
the
decorations
and
furnishings
were
in
subdued
tints
and
quiet
effects
and
there
was
no
loud
or
garish
ornamentation
when
they
entered
a
room
on
the
second
floor
patty
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
delight
oh
aunt
alice
she
said
what
a
lovely
room
is
this
mine
yes
dear
said
her
aunt
and
i
glad
you
like
it
it
was
a
great
pleasure
for
marian
and
me
to
arrange
it
for
you
the
room
was
a
large
one
with
windows
on
two
sides
and
the
coloring
was
all
pale
green
and
ivory
the
walls
were
a
beautiful
shade
of
light
green
with
a
few
and
etchings
in
narrow
gilt
or
ivory
frames
the
carpet
was
plain
green
soft
and
velvety
like
moss
and
the
furniture
of
a
light
wood
was
in
dainty
shapes
with
delicate
tables
and
chairs
the
was
furnished
with
brushes
and
mirrors
and
there
was
a
charming
little
with
sewing
materials
of
all
kinds
an
open
desk
showed
every
kind
of
made
of
ivory
or
and
the
was
pale
green
a
couch
by
a
corner
window
was
provided
with
many
ruffly
fluffy
pillows
covered
with
green
silk
and
a
knitted
afghan
of
soft
green
wool
lay
folded
at
the
foot
two
or
three
vases
of
mignonette
and
ferns
harmonized
with
the
general
effect
and
gave
the
room
a
delightful
fragrance
although
unable
to
appreciate
all
these
details
at
a
first
glance
patty
at
once
realized
that
the
whole
room
presented
a
far
more
charming
and
refined
appearance
than
her
more
elaborate
apartment
at
villa
rosa
with
its
ornate
and
expensive
rugs
it
is
lovely
she
said
to
her
aunt
i
never
saw
a
room
that
i
liked
as
well
i
think
a
fairy
must
have
touched
it
with
her
wand
it
is
all
so
fresh
and
sweet
just
like
a
woodland
dell
this
is
your
fairy
bower
said
aunt
alice
and
she
opened
a
glass
door
leading
out
on
a
balcony
the
balcony
was
as
large
as
a
small
room
and
it
had
a
roof
to
it
and
rattan
shades
at
the
sides
that
could
be
rolled
up
or
down
at
pleasure
vines
clambered
around
the
pillars
and
on
the
railings
between
them
were
palms
and
bright
flowers
growing
in
jars
or
tiled
boxes
on
the
balcony
were
several
easy
chairs
a
round
table
and
a
couch
all
of
wicker
and
across
the
corner
was
swung
a
green
and
white
hammock
with
pillows
of
green
linen
oh
aunt
alice
cried
patty
this
is
this
balcony
yes
dear
said
her
aunt
kissing
her
happy
surprised
little
face
and
i
hope
you
will
often
enjoy
it
i
want
you
to
be
a
happy
patty
during
your
stay
with
us
i
am
happy
already
said
patty
as
they
went
back
into
her
room
in
such
a
lovely
home
and
among
such
lovely
people
may
i
come
in
said
marian
tapping
at
the
open
door
mother
mine
are
you
going
to
monopolize
our
patty
i
have
half
seen
her
yet
you
can
see
me
said
patty
smiling
at
her
cousin
but
you
ca
hear
me
for
i
am
speechless
with
delight
at
this
beautiful
room
and
that
place
outside
and
now
i
going
to
put
my
mother
picture
on
the
desk
and
then
it
will
be
just
perfect
patty
took
the
portrait
from
her
and
aunt
alice
looked
at
it
tenderly
though
she
had
known
her
brother
young
wife
but
a
short
time
she
had
greatly
loved
and
admired
her
you
are
like
your
mother
patty
she
said
so
every
one
tells
me
aunt
alice
but
i
want
to
be
a
fairfield
too
you
think
i
am
like
papa
not
very
much
in
appearance
perhaps
you
are
like
him
in
disposition
wait
until
i
know
you
better
before
i
judge
brother
fred
was
the
stubbornest
boy
i
ever
saw
but
when
i
told
him
so
he
said
it
was
only
firmness
of
character
i
think
that
what
it
is
with
papa
said
patty
loyally
but
i
often
heard
him
say
that
i
used
to
be
very
stubborn
when
i
was
little
it
a
fairfield
trait
said
aunt
alice
smiling
and
as
patty
looked
at
the
lady
she
thought
she
seemed
as
if
perhaps
she
could
be
very
firm
if
occasion
required
marian
said
patty
aunt
alice
says
you
helped
arrange
this
lovely
room
for
me
and
i
want
to
thank
you
and
tell
you
how
much
i
admire
it
oh
i
did
do
much
said
marian
i
only
selected
the
books
and
stocked
the
and
and
made
the
and
did
a
few
little
things
like
that
mamma
did
most
of
it
herself
and
grandma
knitted
the
afghan
is
it
pretty
we
were
all
glad
to
get
ready
for
your
coming
we
looked
forward
to
it
ever
since
you
came
north
come
marian
said
her
mother
let
us
run
away
now
and
leave
patty
to
dress
for
dinner
unless
we
can
help
you
unpack
may
we
your
trunks
have
come
and
i
will
have
them
sent
up
here
at
once
oh
yes
let
me
help
you
put
away
your
things
said
marian
but
patty
with
a
slight
blush
thanked
them
for
their
kind
offers
but
declined
their
assistance
and
for
a
very
good
reason
or
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
the
embarrassed
child
during
her
stay
at
the
poor
wardrobe
had
become
sadly
dilapidated
it
never
occurred
to
the
barlow
family
to
mend
their
clothes
missing
buttons
were
never
replaced
except
by
pins
torn
ends
of
trimming
were
left
hanging
or
snipped
off
and
after
a
whole
summer
carelessness
garments
were
in
a
deplorable
state
so
the
child
really
felt
ashamed
for
her
aunt
and
cousin
who
seemed
to
be
the
quintessence
of
neatness
to
discover
her
untidy
wardrobe
even
her
best
dresses
were
soiled
and
wrinkled
nan
and
bumble
had
helped
her
to
pack
and
their
idea
of
packing
a
trunk
seemed
to
be
to
toss
everything
in
in
a
heap
and
then
jump
on
the
lid
to
make
it
shut
tight
so
woful
patty
looked
over
her
clothes
in
dismay
they
had
seemed
all
right
down
at
the
but
here
in
this
immaculate
green
and
white
room
they
seemed
utterly
out
of
place
and
quite
unworthy
of
being
put
away
in
the
or
cupboards
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
decided
upon
a
dress
to
wear
down
to
dinner
her
light
summer
dresses
had
been
bought
during
one
of
aunt
grace
hurried
trips
to
new
york
and
with
the
viciousness
of
clothing
had
shrunk
and
stretched
in
the
wrong
places
and
showed
occasional
rips
besides
then
being
badly
laundered
and
afterwards
crumpled
in
the
trunk
they
presented
anything
but
the
fresh
crisp
appearance
that
summer
dresses
ought
to
have
so
patty
looked
over
her
other
frocks
but
the
gorgeous
ones
that
she
had
worn
since
she
was
at
aunt
isabel
seemed
more
than
ever
in
glaring
bad
taste
and
as
she
had
needed
no
new
clothes
at
aunt
hester
she
had
bought
none
while
in
boston
with
a
sigh
she
selected
a
pink
muslin
that
did
fairly
well
except
that
the
lace
was
gone
from
one
sleeve
and
two
buttons
were
missing
she
ripped
the
lace
from
the
other
sleeve
so
that
they
might
match
at
least
and
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
there
were
some
buttons
in
a
drawer
of
her
new
of
course
needles
and
thread
were
there
too
which
was
fortunate
for
patty
had
none
in
her
trunk
and
indeed
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
use
them
anyway
as
she
dressed
she
resolved
that
she
would
confide
her
troubles
to
aunt
alice
and
ask
help
in
replenishing
her
wardrobe
i
all
out
of
proportion
she
said
to
herself
and
papa
would
like
it
a
bit
if
he
knew
that
i
did
have
a
decent
dress
to
put
on
but
down
at
the
nobody
cared
or
thought
anything
about
it
as
all
her
shoes
seemed
to
lack
some
buttons
or
to
have
broken
laces
she
put
on
her
best
slippers
and
after
she
had
brushed
her
pretty
hair
and
improved
the
despised
pink
muslin
with
some
bows
of
black
velvet
she
looked
quite
presentable
and
if
aunt
alice
noticed
anything
amiss
she
gave
no
hint
of
it
to
her
young
guest
chapter
xix
a
picnic
aunt
alice
said
patty
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
and
wo
you
come
up
to
my
fairy
bower
so
we
can
be
by
ourselves
for
it
a
sort
of
secret
i
will
my
child
said
aunt
alice
as
soon
as
i
attended
to
a
few
household
duties
i
meet
you
there
in
about
half
an
hour
will
your
secret
keep
that
long
oh
yes
indeed
i
in
no
hurry
at
all
i
do
seem
to
be
included
in
the
secret
said
marian
but
come
with
me
patty
wo
you
until
mamma
is
ready
for
you
i
going
to
water
the
palms
and
plants
in
the
front
veranda
that
is
always
part
of
my
work
let
me
help
you
said
patty
and
the
two
girls
went
off
together
in
a
short
time
aunt
alice
reappeared
saying
now
patty
girl
i
at
your
disposal
marian
dear
remember
this
is
thursday
and
the
basket
drill
is
at
ten
yes
i
know
mamma
i
be
ready
for
it
when
elliott
was
comfortably
seated
in
a
on
the
balcony
patty
drew
up
a
small
wicker
stool
and
sat
down
in
front
of
her
aunt
alice
she
began
my
secret
is
just
this
i
have
any
clothes
that
are
fit
to
wear
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
some
when
i
was
at
aunt
isabel
she
bought
me
loads
of
dresses
but
they
were
all
winter
ones
and
besides
i
do
believe
they
the
kind
you
like
in
boston
at
aunt
hester
nobody
ever
thought
much
about
what
they
wore
and
i
got
along
all
right
somehow
but
this
summer
down
at
aunt
grace
my
clothes
seemed
to
go
to
pieces
all
at
once
like
the
said
aunt
alice
laughing
well
this
is
indeed
a
sad
state
of
affairs
but
perhaps
we
can
find
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
yes
of
course
we
can
said
patty
eagerly
papa
sends
me
money
whenever
i
ask
him
for
it
so
if
you
buy
me
some
clothes
he
repay
you
at
once
i
want
everything
my
things
are
no
good
at
all
wait
wait
said
aunt
alice
do
dispose
of
your
wardrobe
in
such
a
summary
way
suppose
we
look
it
over
together
and
see
what
best
to
be
done
all
right
said
patty
but
i
really
ashamed
to
show
you
the
miserable
lot
why
patty
said
aunt
alice
as
she
looked
over
the
torn
and
crumpled
dresses
and
these
do
seem
to
be
unwearable
but
they
are
not
hopelessly
so
you
see
the
trouble
is
they
been
neglected
and
clothes
like
plants
or
children
wo
thrive
under
neglect
i
know
it
aunt
alice
but
we
never
thought
of
mending
things
down
at
the
and
there
was
no
one
to
do
it
for
us
as
there
was
at
aunt
isabel
never
mind
your
other
aunts
patty
you
have
to
deal
now
with
your
aunt
alice
and
you
will
find
her
a
regular
tyrant
but
the
loving
smile
which
accompanied
this
speech
robbed
it
of
all
tyrannical
effect
now
the
tyrant
went
on
we
put
in
one
pile
all
the
things
that
are
too
faded
or
worn
to
be
of
use
to
you
and
those
we
give
away
to
some
one
who
can
use
them
these
heavy
silk
and
velvet
frocks
and
these
gorgeous
party
dresses
we
just
lay
away
for
the
present
and
now
we
put
in
this
place
all
that
needs
mending
it
a
shame
to
see
these
dainty
little
white
petticoats
and
nightgowns
with
their
buttons
off
and
their
trimmings
torn
yes
aunt
isabel
bought
me
those
and
they
were
lovely
when
they
were
new
and
they
be
lovely
again
for
they
only
need
a
few
stitches
and
some
good
to
make
them
as
pretty
and
fresh
as
ever
do
you
know
how
to
sew
patty
no
aunt
alice
i
do
when
i
was
at
home
miller
our
landlady
always
looked
after
my
things
and
i
never
thought
of
sewing
and
since
i
been
north
i
have
either
well
patty
sewing
is
an
accomplishment
i
suppose
but
i
think
it
is
something
that
every
woman
ought
to
know
and
if
you
are
going
to
keep
my
brother
house
for
him
i
am
going
to
see
to
it
that
you
are
well
equipped
for
the
task
and
to
that
end
i
going
to
instruct
you
in
both
sewing
and
housekeeping
there
miss
patty
fairfield
how
do
you
like
that
patty
ran
to
her
aunt
arms
which
were
open
to
receive
her
and
kissed
her
lovingly
oh
aunt
alice
i
be
so
glad
if
you
will
for
i
do
want
to
keep
house
right
but
aunt
grace
told
me
not
to
worry
about
it
and
the
house
would
keep
itself
never
mind
aunt
grace
now
you
are
under
aunt
alice
orders
as
i
told
you
and
she
was
right
in
telling
you
not
to
worry
about
it
but
as
to
a
house
keeping
itself
i
have
heard
that
the
autohome
has
been
invented
yet
and
until
it
is
we
stand
by
the
old
methods
of
housekeeping
and
so
every
morning
my
dear
patty
unless
something
very
important
calls
you
elsewhere
you
are
to
spend
two
hours
with
me
in
studying
what
the
wise
people
call
domestic
science
but
i
call
domestic
patty
little
face
looked
very
bright
and
happy
for
she
was
truly
anxious
to
learn
these
things
and
there
had
been
no
opportunities
during
her
other
visits
i
treat
marion
in
the
same
way
said
aunt
alice
although
we
have
several
servants
marian
has
learned
and
practiced
many
branches
of
housework
and
she
sews
very
nicely
but
i
do
think
you
will
find
marian
or
even
impatient
at
the
irksome
tasks
no
indeed
aunt
alice
marian
is
as
bright
and
cheery
as
a
sunbeam
and
i
sure
no
task
could
be
irksome
if
you
advised
or
assisted
with
it
oh
you
do
know
me
yet
laughed
aunt
alice
did
i
tell
you
i
was
a
tyrant
but
you
do
need
some
new
things
child
and
we
buy
them
in
a
day
or
two
aunt
alice
counted
over
the
dresses
which
could
be
made
available
for
use
and
then
selecting
a
number
of
garments
only
slightly
out
of
repair
she
said
this
morning
we
attack
these
did
you
hear
me
tell
marian
to
remember
the
basket
drill
well
that
means
the
sewing
or
mending
basket
and
if
you
bring
yours
with
you
we
attend
a
ladies
sewing
society
in
the
at
once
in
the
they
found
marian
with
her
basket
of
work
and
grandma
who
was
darning
stockings
with
kindly
care
and
patience
aunt
alice
showed
patty
how
to
mend
neatly
and
as
the
pupil
was
by
no
means
stupid
she
did
great
credit
to
her
teacher
after
they
had
sewed
for
about
an
hour
elliott
said
now
children
put
away
your
baskets
and
run
out
to
play
you
need
fresh
air
and
sunshine
quite
as
much
as
buttons
and
strings
marian
why
you
take
patty
down
and
show
her
the
falls
you
have
just
about
time
enough
to
go
and
get
back
to
luncheon
we
will
said
marian
come
along
patty
as
patty
was
by
nature
adaptable
to
her
surroundings
she
followed
example
and
arranged
her
tidily
and
then
put
it
away
in
its
place
though
down
at
the
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
her
to
do
so
and
nobody
would
have
set
her
such
an
example
patty
thought
to
herself
well
these
people
have
the
right
proportion
of
system
and
order
anyhow
i
wonder
if
they
lacking
in
some
other
proportion
i
have
seen
it
yet
if
they
are
and
she
did
discover
it
later
either
for
though
not
perfect
people
by
any
means
the
elliotts
had
a
true
sense
of
proportion
and
no
duty
or
pleasure
was
pursued
to
excess
and
so
allowed
to
crowd
out
other
duties
or
pleasures
mother
said
frank
as
they
sat
on
the
veranda
one
evening
soon
after
patty
arrival
i
think
we
might
have
a
picnic
in
patty
honor
i
want
her
to
get
acquainted
with
the
boys
and
girls
and
that
as
good
a
way
as
any
and
if
we
could
have
it
on
saturday
afternoon
perhaps
father
could
take
a
and
go
with
us
that
a
fine
idea
said
aunt
alice
do
you
agree
charlie
yes
said
elliott
i
like
it
of
all
things
shall
we
go
to
foster
woods
yes
said
marian
that
the
nicest
place
for
a
picnic
there
a
lovely
lake
there
patty
and
boats
to
row
about
in
and
tables
for
the
feast
and
everything
how
many
shall
you
invite
said
uncle
charlie
i
engage
stages
to
take
us
all
over
i
want
to
go
said
edith
may
i
mamma
of
course
you
may
said
elliott
we
take
the
whole
family
from
grandma
down
to
little
gilbert
oh
i
ca
go
said
grandma
i
too
old
for
picnics
not
a
bit
said
her
son
if
you
do
care
for
staging
i
send
you
and
alice
and
the
baby
over
in
the
carriage
and
then
they
all
fell
to
planning
the
details
of
the
picnic
and
patty
secretly
contrasted
the
occasion
with
similar
ones
at
her
other
aunts
there
was
no
quarreling
about
arrangements
as
at
villa
rosa
each
deferred
politely
to
the
others
opinions
and
yet
each
frankly
expressed
his
or
her
mind
on
any
subject
and
there
was
no
inattention
or
forgetfulness
as
at
the
each
was
appointed
to
attend
to
several
different
things
and
patty
felt
sure
that
their
promises
would
all
be
fulfilled
let
have
lots
of
sandwiches
said
frank
the
last
picnic
i
went
to
i
did
have
half
enough
and
ca
we
have
jam
in
some
of
them
as
well
as
chicken
and
ham
certainly
my
boy
said
his
mother
i
see
that
you
have
jam
sandwiches
and
ham
sandwiches
and
chicken
sandwiches
and
plenty
of
them
those
names
might
be
shortened
said
uncle
charlie
meditatively
the
is
superfluous
anyway
there
no
sand
in
them
why
do
we
say
jamwiches
hamwiches
and
chickwiches
oh
that
much
better
cried
marian
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
it
before
i
shall
never
mention
a
ham
sandwich
again
a
hamwich
is
so
much
nicer
and
then
there
are
tonguewiches
and
eggwiches
said
patty
delighted
with
the
new
words
and
jellywiches
said
aunt
alice
laughing
and
now
what
else
do
young
people
eat
cakes
and
fruit
i
suppose
yes
and
little
tarts
said
frank
they
awfully
good
on
a
picnic
and
ice
cream
said
marian
i
order
the
ice
cream
said
her
father
and
i
bring
a
big
box
of
candies
from
new
york
frank
you
must
see
to
the
hammocks
and
swings
and
games
if
you
want
them
yes
sir
said
frank
i
take
my
shuffleboard
and
and
build
a
fire
and
make
coffee
shall
we
mother
yes
dear
patty
and
i
will
make
the
coffee
said
aunt
alice
with
a
sidelong
smile
at
her
niece
then
i
know
it
will
be
good
said
frank
saturday
was
a
beautiful
day
clear
and
bright
and
not
too
warm
immediately
after
luncheon
four
stages
went
around
and
gathered
up
about
fifty
young
people
and
a
wagon
full
of
provisions
for
feasting
and
fun
followed
them
to
foster
woods
patty
wore
a
pretty
white
frock
which
under
aunt
alice
instruction
she
had
neatly
mended
and
elliott
skilful
laundress
had
made
clean
and
crisp
the
vernondale
young
people
proved
to
be
a
merry
jolly
crowd
and
pretty
patty
soon
became
a
favorite
frank
and
marian
introduced
her
to
everybody
and
took
special
care
that
she
should
never
lack
for
companions
or
amusement
and
there
was
so
much
to
do
and
patty
enjoyed
it
all
she
was
clever
at
the
games
and
owing
to
her
practice
at
the
she
could
row
as
well
as
any
boy
the
lake
was
a
beautiful
bit
of
water
and
in
some
parts
of
it
grew
in
abundance
the
young
people
gathered
a
quantity
of
these
both
white
and
pink
to
decorate
the
then
when
the
feast
was
ready
uncle
charlie
called
the
children
together
and
they
came
with
a
will
for
their
afternoon
out
of
doors
had
given
them
a
good
appetite
for
the
hamwiches
and
jamwiches
after
supper
was
over
it
was
about
seven
and
uncle
charlie
told
his
young
guests
that
they
could
ramble
round
for
half
an
hour
and
then
they
would
start
on
their
homeward
ride
the
path
by
the
side
of
the
lake
was
a
very
pretty
one
and
elliott
and
her
husband
walked
along
there
with
little
gilbert
between
them
the
child
was
getting
sleepy
and
a
little
wilful
and
while
jane
his
nurse
was
eating
her
supper
his
parents
had
him
in
charge
soon
they
heard
frank
voice
calling
father
wo
you
please
come
here
a
minute
and
help
us
get
this
swing
down
elliott
went
to
help
the
boys
and
elliott
and
gilbert
sat
down
on
the
grassy
bank
to
await
his
return
mamma
said
the
child
shall
i
pick
you
some
pretty
flowers
yes
baby
said
his
mother
who
was
looking
at
the
sunset
and
only
half
listening
but
do
go
far
away
no
said
the
little
fellow
and
how
it
happened
elliott
never
knew
but
seemingly
in
a
moment
gilbert
had
climbed
into
a
boat
and
was
afloat
alone
on
the
lake
for
an
instant
elliott
was
too
frightened
even
to
scream
and
then
she
dared
not
for
the
boat
was
a
little
affair
and
gilbert
was
jumping
about
in
it
so
excitedly
that
if
suddenly
startled
he
might
upset
the
boat
with
great
presence
of
mind
his
mother
spoke
to
him
gently
gilbert
dear
she
said
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
the
boat
and
be
quiet
until
i
call
papa
will
you
there
a
good
boy
i
am
a
good
boy
gilbert
called
back
i
going
to
get
mamma
pretty
pink
the
boat
was
drifting
farther
and
farther
out
and
the
child
sitting
in
the
bow
rocked
it
from
one
side
to
the
other
gilbert
said
his
mother
sternly
sit
right
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
right
in
the
middle
do
you
hear
obey
me
at
once
yes
mamma
said
the
boy
and
he
did
as
she
told
him
to
but
continued
to
rock
the
boat
so
though
the
danger
was
lessened
it
was
still
a
frightful
scene
and
filled
the
poor
mother
heart
with
terror
charlie
charlie
she
called
and
then
frank
but
they
could
not
hear
her
as
they
were
taking
down
some
hammocks
in
another
part
of
the
grove
the
boat
drifted
nearer
to
the
and
elliott
saw
gilbert
lean
over
the
side
of
the
boat
now
i
get
them
for
you
mamma
he
called
elliott
could
scarcely
hear
his
words
but
she
saw
the
boat
overturn
and
her
darling
child
fall
into
the
deep
lake
chapter
xx
the
rescue
when
elliott
called
to
her
husband
and
son
they
could
not
hear
her
but
her
cries
were
heard
by
a
small
group
of
boys
and
girls
who
were
walking
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
at
some
distance
ahead
of
her
patty
and
marian
were
in
this
group
and
at
the
sound
of
her
frightened
cry
marian
turned
pale
and
said
oh
patty
something
dreadful
has
happened
let
us
run
to
mother
but
one
of
the
boys
said
look
out
on
the
lake
there
your
little
brother
in
a
boat
all
alone
oh
cried
marian
he
be
upset
where
papa
can
any
of
you
boys
swim
no
said
two
of
the
boys
and
another
said
i
ca
either
but
going
to
try
do
do
it
said
patty
who
was
already
flinging
off
her
shoes
i
can
swim
and
i
save
the
baby
she
remembered
how
nan
jumped
into
the
water
with
her
ordinary
clothes
on
that
day
at
the
and
so
she
ran
into
the
lake
all
dressed
as
she
was
for
there
was
no
time
to
lose
and
struck
out
for
the
boat
she
had
taken
but
a
few
strokes
when
she
saw
the
child
fall
into
the
water
and
heard
elliott
give
a
despairing
shriek
patty
gave
one
shout
of
all
right
aunt
alice
i
get
him
and
then
swam
for
dear
life
this
was
literally
true
for
she
was
determined
to
save
the
dear
life
of
little
gilbert
if
she
possibly
could
and
she
did
for
as
the
baby
rose
to
the
surface
patty
was
near
enough
to
grasp
him
and
then
managed
to
reach
the
overturned
boat
and
by
its
support
she
easily
kept
herself
and
the
child
afloat
he
all
right
she
called
to
the
crowd
now
gathering
on
the
bank
i
can
hold
him
up
somebody
come
out
after
us
in
a
boat
but
two
boats
had
already
started
and
in
a
few
minutes
gilbert
was
lifted
into
one
and
patty
scrambled
into
the
other
and
they
were
quickly
rowed
ashore
and
when
they
landed
on
the
beach
uncle
charlie
with
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
tried
to
embrace
both
patty
and
gilbert
at
once
aunt
alice
could
speak
but
the
looks
of
love
and
gratitude
she
gave
patty
said
more
than
words
could
and
patty
felt
that
this
was
the
happiest
moment
of
her
life
and
what
a
fuss
the
young
people
made
over
her
the
boys
praised
her
pluck
and
the
girls
marveled
at
her
skill
but
as
patty
and
gilbert
were
both
dripping
wet
and
it
was
already
nightfall
the
question
was
what
to
do
to
keep
them
from
taking
cold
build
up
the
fire
again
said
grandma
and
we
undress
the
baby
and
wrap
him
all
up
in
one
of
the
carriage
robes
and
there
another
carriage
robe
for
patty
said
marian
i
fix
patty
said
uncle
charlie
have
some
of
you
girls
a
big
that
wo
be
spoiled
if
it
gets
wet
several
shawls
were
eagerly
offered
and
uncle
charlie
selected
two
big
warm
ones
and
wrapped
patty
wet
clothes
and
all
tightly
in
them
leaving
only
her
face
exposed
until
she
looked
like
a
mummy
and
was
wound
so
tight
she
could
stand
up
without
assistance
but
uncle
charlie
took
the
laughing
mummy
in
his
arms
and
lifted
her
right
into
his
carriage
and
then
got
in
and
sat
beside
her
now
give
me
the
baby
he
said
and
gilbert
equally
wrapped
up
was
put
into
his
arms
help
your
mother
and
grandma
in
frank
he
said
and
then
my
son
you
must
look
after
your
guests
and
see
that
the
stages
are
filled
and
started
off
we
will
drive
home
quickly
and
i
think
our
patty
and
gilbert
will
suffer
no
harm
from
their
bath
you
and
marian
must
explain
all
this
and
say
to
our
guests
it
has
been
a
terrible
experience
but
we
are
all
safe
now
and
i
do
want
the
young
people
to
feel
saddened
yes
father
said
frank
i
take
charge
here
and
look
after
marian
and
edith
and
attend
to
getting
everything
and
everybody
home
safely
then
the
driver
took
up
his
whip
and
elliott
horses
flew
over
the
ground
at
a
mad
pace
although
the
sudden
fright
had
shocked
elliott
terribly
she
was
beginning
to
recover
herself
and
by
the
time
the
carriage
reached
home
she
was
all
ready
to
take
charge
of
affairs
in
her
usual
capable
way
uncle
charlie
deposited
the
bundle
of
baby
on
the
sofa
and
then
went
back
and
carried
in
what
he
called
his
mummy
niece
grandma
said
elliott
i
give
our
darling
patty
into
your
charge
for
the
present
will
you
see
that
she
has
a
hot
bath
and
a
steaming
hot
drink
made
after
one
of
your
good
old
recipes
and
then
tuck
her
into
her
bed
in
time
after
i
treat
baby
in
a
similar
fashion
and
get
him
to
sleep
i
will
interview
my
niece
myself
and
when
that
interview
took
place
patty
was
made
to
know
how
deep
a
mother
gratitude
can
be
and
the
bond
sealed
that
night
between
aunt
alice
and
her
niece
was
one
of
lifelong
endurance
and
deep
true
love
next
day
the
water
babies
as
uncle
charlie
called
patty
and
gilbert
were
as
well
as
ever
and
suffered
no
ill
effects
from
their
dip
in
the
lake
many
of
the
vernondale
boys
and
girls
came
to
see
patty
and
frank
and
marian
exhibited
her
with
pride
as
if
she
were
an
imperial
treasure
patty
bore
her
honors
modestly
for
it
did
seem
to
her
that
she
had
done
anything
specially
meritorious
she
was
glad
bob
and
uncle
ted
had
taught
her
to
swim
so
well
and
even
greater
than
her
joy
at
saving
gilbert
life
was
the
thought
that
she
had
saved
the
boy
for
her
dear
aunt
alice
whom
she
loved
so
much
when
uncle
charlie
came
home
from
new
york
that
night
he
brought
patty
a
beautiful
gold
brooch
set
with
pearls
and
with
a
sparkling
diamond
in
the
centre
this
is
a
reward
patty
dear
he
said
for
no
amount
of
jewels
could
represent
the
value
of
our
baby
life
but
i
want
you
to
wear
it
sometimes
as
heroes
wear
the
victoria
cross
or
as
men
at
the
stations
wear
their
medals
patty
heart
was
touched
at
this
expression
of
uncle
charlie
gratitude
and
she
was
delighted
too
with
the
beautiful
gift
i
do
want
any
reward
uncle
she
said
but
i
shall
keep
this
lovely
brooch
all
my
life
as
one
of
my
choicest
treasures
chapter
xxi
a
with
october
came
there
was
a
fine
school
for
young
ladies
in
vernondale
which
marian
attended
and
aunt
alice
thought
it
best
for
patty
to
go
too
the
cousins
who
had
become
inseparable
companions
enjoyed
their
together
and
the
added
duties
which
lessons
brought
caused
aunt
alice
to
make
patty
household
tasks
rather
fewer
that
lady
was
by
no
means
an
advocate
of
all
work
and
no
play
and
though
some
domestic
duties
were
imposed
and
a
cake
or
a
dessert
was
taught
every
saturday
yet
patty
had
plenty
of
time
for
amusements
and
plenty
of
amusements
for
her
time
one
october
day
patty
and
marian
and
two
of
their
schoolgirl
friends
sat
on
patty
balcony
drinking
afternoon
tea
it
was
getting
late
in
the
season
to
use
the
pretty
balcony
but
it
chanced
to
be
a
bright
sunny
autumn
day
and
the
girls
had
their
wraps
on
besides
they
were
talking
so
busily
that
i
think
they
would
scarcely
have
noticed
it
had
the
mercury
suddenly
fallen
to
zero
yes
elsie
morris
was
saying
we
have
a
real
literary
club
and
have
a
president
and
constitution
and
everything
but
do
let
have
too
many
members
about
twelve
girls
i
should
say
only
girls
said
marian
are
we
going
to
have
any
boys
i
know
frank
would
like
to
join
oh
boys
do
like
to
read
said
polly
stevens
they
nice
at
parties
and
picnics
but
we
want
this
club
to
be
really
literary
and
not
just
fooling
i
know
it
said
marian
but
we
thought
we
have
little
plays
and
tableaux
and
things
like
that
and
how
can
we
manage
those
without
boys
what
do
you
say
patty
i
think
it
nice
to
have
the
boys
said
patty
but
they
wo
come
much
in
the
afternoons
if
we
have
them
it
have
to
be
an
evening
affair
let
ask
aunt
alice
yes
said
elsie
elliott
always
knows
just
what
to
do
i
go
after
her
said
patty
and
away
she
ran
and
returned
in
triumph
with
her
aunt
now
my
blessed
auntie
she
said
as
she
gave
her
a
seat
and
wrapped
a
fleecy
shawl
about
her
shoulders
let
me
offer
you
a
cup
of
tea
for
we
are
going
to
give
you
a
weighty
question
to
decide
and
you
need
a
stimulant
very
well
said
aunt
alice
laughing
but
you
better
ask
the
question
quickly
for
this
tea
does
look
very
strong
and
its
effects
will
soon
wear
off
so
the
girls
all
talked
at
once
or
at
least
two
at
a
time
and
explained
that
they
wanted
a
literary
club
and
while
they
all
liked
the
boys
and
would
be
glad
of
their
assistance
in
plays
and
tableaux
yet
they
knew
that
if
boys
came
to
the
meetings
there
be
little
or
no
serious
reading
done
it
may
be
the
effects
of
your
tea
said
elliott
but
the
solution
of
your
problem
seems
to
me
so
easy
that
i
wonder
you
did
think
it
out
for
yourselves
oh
what
is
it
said
elsie
and
marian
together
why
have
your
club
of
girls
only
and
have
your
meetings
on
saturday
afternoons
as
you
proposed
and
then
occasionally
say
once
a
month
have
an
evening
meeting
and
invite
the
boys
and
have
your
dramatic
or
musical
entertainments
then
i
knew
you
fix
it
aunt
alice
said
patty
beaming
wo
that
be
just
right
girls
they
all
agreed
to
this
wise
plan
and
immediately
made
out
a
list
of
twelve
girls
who
if
they
accepted
the
invitation
were
to
attend
the
first
club
meeting
at
elsie
morris
house
on
the
following
saturday
every
one
did
accept
and
the
club
was
formed
and
the
twelve
members
went
to
work
with
a
will
to
make
rules
and
plans
patty
was
unanimously
elected
president
she
hesitated
about
undertaking
to
fill
such
a
responsible
office
but
the
girls
one
and
all
insisted
upon
it
in
a
determined
if
not
very
parliamentary
way
and
so
she
accepted
the
position
feeling
sure
that
aunt
alice
would
assist
and
advise
her
in
any
difficulties
that
might
arise
the
literary
club
proved
a
great
success
patty
made
a
very
capable
and
graceful
little
president
and
when
at
a
meeting
in
november
the
girls
began
to
discuss
an
evening
entertainment
to
be
held
in
december
and
patty
remarked
that
perhaps
she
would
be
in
vernondale
then
a
general
outcry
was
raised
what
do
you
mean
why
not
why
patty
fairfield
where
are
you
going
i
do
know
where
i
going
said
patty
but
my
visit
at
marian
will
be
over
the
first
of
december
and
then
i
going
to
have
a
new
home
and
i
do
know
where
it
will
be
but
oh
girls
i
wish
it
could
be
in
vernondale
why
ca
it
said
marian
eagerly
why
ca
uncle
fred
buy
a
house
here
and
then
you
can
live
here
all
your
life
oh
patty
would
that
be
just
fine
oh
patty
do
chorused
all
the
girls
and
patty
resolved
that
if
she
had
any
voice
in
the
matter
vernondale
should
be
her
future
home
chapter
xxii
a
welcome
guest
oh
aunt
alice
cried
patty
flying
into
her
aunt
room
one
morning
in
the
latter
part
of
november
i
just
had
a
letter
from
papa
and
be
here
for
is
that
grand
and
catching
her
aunt
round
the
waist
patty
waltzed
her
up
and
down
the
room
until
the
good
lady
was
nearly
breathless
i
as
glad
as
you
are
patty
girl
she
said
when
her
niece
finally
allowed
her
to
come
to
a
standstill
for
i
have
seen
brother
fred
for
many
long
years
but
i
can
tell
you
that
his
coming
does
by
any
means
bring
your
visit
to
an
end
i
going
to
keep
you
both
here
with
me
until
after
the
holidays
and
longer
too
if
i
can
well
i
be
only
too
glad
to
stay
as
long
as
papa
is
willing
and
i
do
hope
i
can
persuade
him
to
settle
in
vernondale
you
believe
he
will
aunt
alice
i
do
know
i
think
he
is
inclined
to
make
his
home
in
new
york
city
but
vernondale
is
a
pleasant
place
and
so
near
new
york
as
to
be
a
sort
of
suburb
well
i
going
to
coax
him
anyhow
and
now
aunt
alice
i
going
to
ask
you
a
big
big
favor
may
i
yes
you
may
ask
but
i
wo
make
any
rash
promises
to
grant
it
until
i
hear
what
it
is
well
i
afraid
you
think
i
wo
make
them
good
enough
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
pumpkin
pies
for
papa
would
be
so
surprised
and
pleased
why
of
course
you
may
child
i
be
very
glad
to
be
relieved
of
that
duty
and
cook
will
have
all
she
can
attend
to
when
is
uncle
fred
coming
said
frank
as
they
all
sat
at
dinner
that
evening
the
night
before
thanksgiving
said
patty
he
arrive
at
about
nine
well
we
give
him
a
rousing
welcome
said
frank
a
sort
of
home
you
know
all
right
said
his
father
who
was
ever
ready
for
a
frolic
what
can
we
do
out
of
the
ordinary
we
could
decorate
the
veranda
with
said
marian
and
he
see
them
as
he
drives
up
just
the
thing
said
frank
and
oh
i
have
a
fine
plan
but
we
tell
patty
at
least
not
yet
the
day
before
thanksgiving
the
children
were
all
allowed
to
stay
home
from
school
to
make
the
final
preparations
for
uncle
fred
reception
while
patty
was
in
the
kitchen
making
her
pumpkin
pies
and
surely
such
beautiful
pies
never
were
made
before
or
since
there
was
much
rushing
in
and
out
of
the
parlor
and
sounds
of
hammering
and
of
moving
furniture
reached
patty
ears
but
she
was
told
that
she
would
not
be
allowed
even
to
peep
into
the
room
until
evening
so
after
the
pies
were
made
patty
ran
up
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
her
father
bedroom
she
filled
the
vases
with
fresh
flowers
laid
out
a
new
book
which
she
had
bought
as
a
welcoming
gift
for
him
and
on
his
she
placed
the
cherished
portrait
of
her
mother
and
talking
to
the
picture
as
she
often
did
she
said
i
going
to
lend
you
to
him
motherdy
for
a
few
days
i
shall
miss
you
of
course
but
we
want
to
give
him
the
very
best
welcome
possible
patty
was
allowed
to
help
with
all
the
preparations
except
those
in
the
parlor
and
she
was
extremely
curious
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
there
but
she
found
plenty
to
occupy
her
time
for
the
whole
house
was
to
be
decorated
on
the
veranda
railing
were
many
which
when
their
candles
were
lighted
would
flash
a
welcome
from
their
wide
funny
mouths
and
round
eyes
the
hall
was
decorated
with
boughs
of
evergreen
among
which
were
tiny
yellow
squashes
and
gourds
also
cut
like
and
holding
small
candles
the
was
decorated
with
bunches
of
grain
and
red
peppers
for
said
frank
it
wo
be
a
harvest
home
unless
we
have
grain
and
winter
vegetables
after
all
was
ready
patty
went
to
don
the
pretty
dress
which
aunt
alice
and
she
had
bought
for
the
great
occasion
it
was
a
dainty
little
blue
and
white
striped
silk
with
ruffles
edged
with
narrow
black
velvet
the
yoke
and
sleeves
were
of
fine
white
embroidered
muslin
and
very
fair
and
sweet
patty
looked
as
she
clasped
her
victoria
cross
at
her
throat
now
can
i
go
in
the
parlor
frank
she
said
as
she
met
her
cousin
on
the
stairs
yes
patsy
come
along
and
the
boy
threw
open
the
parlor
doors
with
a
flourish
the
room
was
elaborately
trimmed
with
palms
and
chrysanthemums
and
at
one
end
was
a
raised
platform
like
a
throne
on
which
stood
a
large
armchair
draped
with
a
red
velvet
portière
above
this
was
a
semicircular
canopy
cleverly
made
of
cornstalks
and
bunches
of
grain
and
up
on
the
very
top
was
the
biggest
pumpkin
you
ever
saw
cut
like
a
more
tall
cornstalks
formed
a
background
to
the
throne
and
at
each
side
stood
a
noble
sheaf
of
wheat
thickly
scattered
over
the
whole
affair
were
gourds
or
which
had
been
hollowed
out
and
held
lighted
tapers
while
across
the
top
was
welcome
in
large
letters
made
of
gilt
paper
oh
said
patty
quite
awestruck
at
this
bright
and
novel
scene
what
is
it
all
for
tell
her
mother
said
frank
to
aunt
alice
who
had
just
come
in
i
must
go
and
listen
for
the
carriage
it
for
you
patty
said
her
aunt
you
are
to
sit
there
and
welcome
your
father
when
he
comes
and
you
better
jump
into
the
chair
now
for
he
may
be
here
at
any
minute
oh
how
kind
you
all
are
said
patty
did
frank
do
all
this
for
me
wo
papa
be
pleased
patty
flew
up
the
steps
and
settled
herself
in
the
great
chair
with
delight
that
all
right
said
marian
who
had
just
come
in
and
who
gave
a
critical
glance
at
the
whole
picture
now
there
patty
do
jump
down
when
you
hear
us
greet
uncle
fred
in
the
hall
i
wo
said
patty
i
stay
and
in
another
minute
the
carriage
drove
up
and
patty
heard
her
father
voice
greeting
aunt
alice
and
her
cousins
and
then
saying
but
where
patty
where
my
girl
here
papa
cried
patty
mindful
of
her
promise
to
sit
still
but
unable
to
resist
calling
to
him
and
then
fairfield
hurried
into
the
parlor
and
saw
his
pretty
daughter
enthroned
to
welcome
him
but
at
sight
of
his
dear
face
patty
sit
still
and
she
flew
out
of
her
chair
and
was
in
her
father
arms
before
he
was
across
the
room
nobody
minded
however
for
there
was
such
a
chattering
and
laughing
and
frolicking
as
you
never
saw
and
all
the
time
fairfield
kept
his
arm
around
his
little
daughter
as
if
he
would
never
let
her
leave
him
again
but
do
think
your
beautiful
work
is
appreciated
my
boy
he
said
to
frank
as
patty
called
his
attention
to
the
cleverly
constructed
throne
indeed
i
think
now
is
the
time
to
put
it
to
use
and
fairfield
seated
himself
in
the
big
chair
and
drew
patty
down
upon
his
knee
then
frank
led
off
in
three
hearty
cheers
for
uncle
fred
and
patty
and
the
elliott
family
joined
in
with
a
will
and
what
a
merry
happy
they
had
on
the
morrow
patty
pies
were
praised
until
the
little
maid
blushed
at
the
compliments
she
received
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
father
and
daughter
found
an
opportunity
for
a
little
talk
by
themselves
and
then
patty
told
of
her
love
and
admiration
for
aunt
alice
and
her
great
desire
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
vernondale
for
you
see
papa
she
said
aunt
alice
is
the
only
one
of
my
aunts
who
has
a
sense
of
proportion
and
she
certainly
has
she
is
rich
but
she
does
talk
about
it
like
aunt
isabel
people
she
reads
and
knows
a
lot
about
books
but
she
does
seem
to
think
there
nothing
else
in
the
world
books
as
aunt
hester
family
does
and
as
for
the
people
they
lovely
in
some
ways
but
after
living
with
aunt
alice
i
could
stand
their
forgetfulness
and
carelessness
and
then
aunt
alice
has
everything
in
her
life
and
not
too
much
of
anything
either
we
children
have
lots
of
fun
and
good
times
but
we
have
to
work
some
too
and
aunt
alice
teaches
us
to
be
kind
and
polite
without
making
any
fuss
about
it
and
she
does
beautiful
charity
work
and
she
so
happy
and
sweet
that
everybody
loves
her
and
papa
dear
i
do
want
to
continue
to
live
near
aunt
alice
and
let
her
keep
on
advising
me
and
teaching
me
and
so
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
for
you
to
buy
a
house
in
vernondale
and
live
here
well
my
girl
you
made
out
a
pretty
strong
case
have
you
said
her
father
and
as
my
principal
object
in
life
is
to
make
you
happy
i
think
patty
dear
that
i
let
you
decide
where
our
home
shall
be
and
how
it
shall
be
conducted
the
end
