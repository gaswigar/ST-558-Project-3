pursued
the
smaller
greenish
globe
of
its
companion
across
a
cloudless
sky
in
which
the
stars
made
a
speckled
pattern
like
the
scales
of
a
huge
serpent
coiled
around
a
black
bowl
ras
hume
paused
at
the
border
of
scented
on
the
top
terrace
of
the
pleasure
house
to
wonder
why
he
thought
of
serpents
he
understood
mankind
hatred
brought
from
his
native
planet
to
the
distant
stars
was
evil
symbolized
by
a
coil
in
a
twisted
across
the
ground
and
on
nahuatl
as
well
as
a
dozen
other
worlds
wass
was
the
serpent
a
night
wind
was
rising
stirring
the
exotic
other
foliage
planted
cunningly
on
the
terrace
to
simulate
the
mystery
of
an
jungle
hume
the
inquiry
seemed
to
come
out
of
thin
air
over
his
head
hume
he
repeated
his
own
name
calmly
a
shaft
of
light
brilliant
enough
to
dazzle
the
eyes
struck
through
the
massed
vegetation
revealing
a
path
hume
lingered
for
a
moment
offering
a
counterstroke
of
indifference
in
what
he
had
always
known
would
be
a
test
of
wits
wass
was
veep
of
a
shadowy
empire
but
that
was
apart
from
the
world
in
which
ras
hume
moved
he
strode
deliberately
down
the
corridor
illuminated
between
leaf
and
blossom
walls
a
grotesque
lump
of
crystal
leered
at
him
from
the
heart
of
a
tharsala
lilly
bed
the
intricate
carving
of
a
devilish
nonhuman
set
of
features
was
a
work
of
alien
art
tendrils
of
smoke
curled
from
the
thing
flat
nostrils
and
hume
sniffed
the
scent
of
a
narcotic
he
recognized
he
smiled
such
measures
might
soften
up
the
usual
civ
wass
interviewed
here
but
a
star
pilot
turned
was
immunized
against
such
mind
clouding
there
was
a
door
the
lintel
and
posts
of
which
had
more
carving
but
this
time
terran
hume
thought
old
very
old
perhaps
rumor
was
right
milfors
wass
might
be
truly
native
terran
and
not
second
third
nor
fourth
generation
star
stock
as
most
of
those
who
reached
nahuatl
were
the
room
beyond
that
elaborately
carved
entrance
was
in
contrast
severe
rust
walls
were
bare
of
any
pattern
save
an
oval
disk
of
cloudy
golden
shimmer
behind
the
chair
at
the
long
table
of
solid
ruby
rock
from
nahuatl
poisonous
sister
planet
of
xipe
without
a
pause
he
walked
to
the
chair
and
seated
himself
without
invitation
to
wait
in
the
empty
room
that
clouded
oval
might
be
a
com
device
hume
refused
to
look
at
it
after
his
first
glance
this
interview
was
to
be
person
to
person
if
wass
did
not
appear
within
a
reasonable
length
of
time
he
would
leave
and
hume
hoped
to
any
unseen
watcher
he
presented
the
appearance
of
a
man
not
impressed
by
stage
settings
after
all
he
was
now
in
the
seller
space
boots
and
it
was
a
seller
market
ras
hume
rested
his
right
hand
on
the
table
against
the
polished
glow
of
the
stone
the
substance
of
it
was
brown
a
perfect
match
for
his
left
and
the
subtle
difference
between
true
flesh
and
false
was
no
hindrance
in
the
use
of
those
fingers
or
their
strength
save
that
it
had
pushed
him
out
of
command
of
a
and
hurled
him
down
from
the
pinnacle
of
a
star
pilot
there
were
bitter
brackets
about
his
mouth
set
there
by
that
hand
as
deeply
as
if
carved
with
a
knife
it
had
been
four
years
planet
time
since
he
had
lifted
the
rigal
rover
from
the
launch
pad
on
sargon
two
he
had
suspected
it
might
be
a
tricky
voyage
with
young
tors
wazalitz
who
was
a
third
owner
of
the
line
and
a
gratz
chewer
but
one
did
not
argue
with
the
owners
except
when
the
safety
of
the
ship
was
concerned
the
rigal
rover
had
made
a
crash
landing
at
alexbut
and
a
badly
injured
pilot
had
brought
her
in
by
will
hope
and
a
faith
he
speedily
lost
he
received
a
the
best
the
medical
center
could
supply
and
a
pension
for
life
forced
by
the
public
acclaim
for
a
man
who
had
saved
ships
and
lives
then
the
sack
because
a
crazed
tors
wazalitz
was
dead
they
dared
not
try
to
stick
hume
with
a
murder
charge
the
voyage
record
tapes
had
been
shot
straight
through
to
the
patrol
council
and
the
evidence
on
those
could
be
neither
faked
nor
tampered
with
they
could
not
give
him
a
quick
punishment
but
they
could
try
to
arrange
a
slow
death
the
word
had
gone
out
that
hume
was
off
pilot
boards
they
had
tried
to
keep
him
out
of
space
and
they
might
have
done
it
too
had
he
been
the
usual
type
of
pilot
knowing
only
his
trade
but
some
odd
streak
of
restlessness
had
always
led
him
to
apply
for
the
rim
runs
the
very
first
flights
to
newly
opened
worlds
outside
of
the
survey
men
there
were
few
qualified
pilots
of
his
seniority
who
possessed
such
a
wide
and
varied
knowledge
of
the
galactic
frontiers
so
when
he
learned
that
the
ships
boards
were
irrevocably
closed
to
him
hume
had
signed
up
with
the
guild
there
was
a
vast
difference
between
lifting
a
liner
from
a
launching
pad
and
guiding
civ
hunters
to
worlds
surveyed
and
staked
out
for
their
trips
into
the
wild
hume
relished
the
exploration
part
he
disliked
the
of
of
the
guild
clients
but
if
he
had
not
been
in
the
guild
service
he
would
never
have
made
that
find
on
jumala
that
lucky
lucky
find
hume
fingers
curved
their
nails
drew
across
the
red
surface
of
the
table
and
where
was
wass
he
was
about
to
rise
and
go
when
the
golden
oval
on
the
wall
smoked
its
substance
thinning
to
a
mist
as
a
man
stepped
through
to
the
floor
the
newcomer
was
small
compared
to
the
former
pilot
but
he
had
breadth
of
shoulder
which
made
the
upper
part
of
his
torso
overbalance
his
thin
hips
and
legs
he
was
dressed
most
conservatively
except
for
a
jeweled
plaque
resting
on
the
tightly
stretched
gray
silk
of
his
upper
tunic
at
heart
level
unlike
hume
he
wore
no
visible
arms
belt
but
the
other
did
not
doubt
that
there
were
a
number
of
devices
concealed
in
that
room
to
counter
the
efforts
of
any
assassin
the
man
from
the
mirror
spoke
with
a
flat
toneless
voice
his
black
hair
had
been
shaven
well
above
his
ears
the
locks
left
on
top
of
his
skull
trained
into
a
kind
of
bird
crest
as
hume
his
visible
areas
of
flesh
were
deeply
browned
but
by
nature
rather
than
exposure
to
space
the
pilot
guessed
his
features
were
harsh
with
a
prominent
nose
a
forehead
eyes
dark
long
and
large
with
heavy
lids
now
he
spread
both
his
hands
palm
down
and
flat
on
the
table
a
gesture
hume
found
himself
for
some
unknown
reason
copying
you
have
a
proposition
but
the
pilot
was
not
to
be
hurried
any
more
than
he
was
to
be
influenced
by
wass
i
have
an
idea
he
corrected
there
are
many
ideas
wass
leaned
back
in
his
chair
but
he
did
not
remove
his
hands
from
the
table
perhaps
one
in
a
thousand
is
the
kernel
of
something
useful
for
the
rest
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
a
man
agreed
hume
returned
evenly
but
that
one
idea
in
a
thousand
can
also
pay
off
in
odds
of
a
million
to
one
when
and
if
a
man
has
it
and
you
have
such
a
one
i
have
such
a
one
it
was
hume
role
now
to
impress
the
other
by
his
unshakable
confidence
he
had
studied
all
the
possibilities
wass
was
the
right
man
perhaps
the
only
partner
he
could
find
but
wass
must
not
know
that
on
jumala
wass
returned
if
that
stare
and
statement
was
intended
to
rattle
hume
it
was
a
wasted
shot
to
discover
that
he
had
just
returned
from
that
frontier
planet
required
no
ingenuity
on
the
veep
part
perhaps
come
hume
we
are
both
busy
men
this
is
no
time
to
play
tricks
with
words
and
hints
either
you
have
made
a
find
worth
the
attention
of
my
organization
or
you
have
not
let
me
be
the
judge
this
was
it
the
corner
of
no
return
but
wass
had
his
own
code
the
veep
had
established
his
tight
control
of
his
lawless
organization
by
set
rules
and
one
of
them
was
do
be
greedy
wass
was
never
greedy
which
is
why
the
patrol
had
never
been
able
to
pull
him
down
and
those
who
dealt
with
him
did
not
talk
if
you
had
a
good
thing
and
wass
accepted
temporary
partnership
he
kept
his
side
of
the
bargain
rigidly
you
did
the
same
or
regretted
your
stupidity
a
claimant
to
the
kogan
estate
that
good
enough
for
you
wass
showed
no
surprise
and
how
would
such
a
claimant
be
profitable
to
us
hume
appreciated
that
us
he
had
an
in
now
if
you
supply
the
claimant
surely
you
can
claim
a
reward
in
more
ways
than
one
true
but
one
does
not
produce
a
claimant
out
of
a
krusha
dream
the
investigation
for
any
such
claim
now
would
be
made
by
a
verity
lab
and
no
imposture
will
pass
those
tests
while
a
real
claimant
would
not
need
your
help
or
mine
depends
upon
the
claimant
one
you
discovered
on
jumala
no
hume
shook
his
head
slowly
i
found
something
else
on
jumala
an
from
largo
drift
intact
and
in
good
shape
from
the
evidence
now
in
existence
it
could
have
landed
there
with
survivors
aboard
and
the
evidence
of
such
survivors
living
on
that
exists
also
hume
shrugged
his
fingers
flexed
slightly
it
has
been
six
planet
years
there
is
a
forest
where
the
rests
no
no
evidence
at
present
the
largo
drift
wass
repeated
slowly
carrying
among
others
gentlefem
tharlee
kogan
brodie
and
her
son
rynch
brodie
who
was
at
the
time
of
the
largo
disappearance
a
boy
of
fourteen
you
have
indeed
made
a
find
wass
gave
that
simple
statement
enough
emphasis
to
assure
hume
he
had
won
his
idea
had
been
absorbed
was
now
being
examined
amplified
broken
down
into
details
he
could
never
have
hoped
to
manage
for
himself
by
the
most
cunning
criminal
brain
in
at
least
five
solar
systems
is
there
any
hope
of
survivors
wass
attacked
the
problem
straight
on
no
evidence
even
of
there
being
any
passengers
when
the
planeted
those
are
automatic
and
released
a
certain
number
of
seconds
after
an
accident
alarm
for
what
it
worth
the
hatch
of
this
one
was
open
it
could
have
brought
in
survivors
but
i
was
on
jumala
for
three
months
with
a
full
guild
crew
and
we
found
no
sign
of
any
castaways
so
you
propose
on
the
basis
of
my
report
jumala
has
been
put
up
for
a
safari
choice
the
could
well
be
innocently
discovered
by
a
client
every
one
knows
the
story
with
the
case
dragging
through
the
ten
courts
now
gentlefem
brodie
and
her
son
might
not
have
been
news
ten
years
ago
now
with
a
third
of
the
control
going
to
them
any
find
linked
with
the
largo
drift
would
gain
full
galactic
coverage
you
have
a
choice
of
survivor
the
gentlefem
hume
shook
his
head
the
boy
he
was
bright
according
to
the
stories
since
and
he
would
have
the
survival
manual
from
the
ship
to
study
he
could
have
grown
up
in
the
wilds
of
an
unopened
planet
to
use
a
woman
is
too
tricky
you
are
entirely
right
but
we
shall
require
an
extremely
clever
imposter
i
think
not
hume
cool
glance
met
wass
we
only
need
a
youth
of
the
proper
general
physical
description
and
the
use
of
a
conditioner
wass
expression
did
not
change
there
was
no
sign
that
hume
hint
had
struck
home
but
when
he
replied
there
was
a
slight
change
in
the
monotone
of
his
voice
you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
i
am
a
man
who
listens
hume
replied
and
i
do
not
always
discount
rumor
as
mere
fantasy
that
is
true
as
one
of
the
guild
you
would
be
interested
in
the
root
of
fact
beneath
the
plant
of
fiction
wass
acknowledged
you
appear
to
have
done
some
planning
on
your
own
i
have
waited
and
watched
for
just
such
an
opportunity
as
this
hume
answered
ah
yes
the
combine
incurred
your
displeasure
i
see
you
are
also
a
man
who
does
not
forget
easily
and
that
too
i
understand
it
is
a
foible
of
my
own
i
neither
forget
nor
forgive
my
enemies
though
i
may
seem
to
do
so
and
time
separates
them
from
their
past
deeds
for
a
space
hume
accepted
that
warning
both
must
keep
any
bargain
wass
was
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
to
leave
time
for
the
thought
to
root
itself
then
he
spoke
again
a
youth
with
the
proper
physical
qualifications
have
you
any
such
in
mind
i
think
so
hume
was
short
he
will
need
certain
memories
those
take
time
to
tape
those
dealing
with
jumala
i
can
supply
yes
you
will
have
to
provide
a
tape
beginning
with
his
arrival
on
that
world
for
such
family
material
as
is
necessary
i
shall
have
ready
an
interesting
project
even
apart
from
its
value
to
us
this
is
one
to
intrigue
experts
expert
wass
had
them
men
who
had
slipped
over
the
border
of
the
law
had
entered
wass
organization
and
prospered
there
there
were
some
techs
crooked
enough
to
enjoy
such
a
project
for
its
own
sake
indulging
in
forbidden
experimentation
for
a
moment
but
only
for
a
moment
something
in
hume
jibbed
at
the
intent
of
carrying
through
his
plan
then
he
shrugged
that
tinge
aside
how
soon
do
you
wish
to
move
how
long
will
preparation
take
hume
asked
in
return
for
the
second
time
battling
a
taste
of
concern
three
months
maybe
four
there
research
to
be
done
and
tapes
to
be
made
it
will
be
six
months
probably
before
the
guild
sets
up
a
safari
for
jumala
wass
smiled
that
need
not
worry
us
when
the
time
comes
for
a
safari
there
shall
also
be
clients
impeccable
clients
asking
for
it
to
be
planned
there
would
be
too
hume
knew
wass
influence
reached
into
places
where
the
veep
himself
was
totally
unknown
yes
he
could
count
on
an
excellent
well
above
suspicion
set
of
clients
to
discover
rynch
brodie
when
the
time
came
i
can
deliver
the
boy
tonight
or
early
tomorrow
morning
where
you
are
sure
of
your
selection
he
fulfills
the
requirements
the
right
age
general
appearance
a
boy
who
will
not
be
missed
who
has
no
kin
no
ties
and
who
will
drop
out
of
sight
without
any
questions
to
be
asked
very
well
get
him
at
once
deliver
him
here
wass
swept
one
hand
across
the
table
surface
on
the
red
of
the
stone
there
glowed
for
seconds
an
address
hume
noted
it
nodded
it
was
one
in
the
center
of
the
port
town
one
which
could
be
visited
at
an
odd
hour
without
exciting
any
curiosity
he
rose
he
will
be
there
tomorrow
at
your
convenience
wass
added
you
will
come
to
this
place
again
the
palm
moved
and
a
second
address
showed
on
the
table
there
you
will
begin
your
tape
for
our
use
it
may
take
several
sessions
i
ready
i
still
have
the
long
report
to
make
to
the
guild
so
the
material
is
still
available
on
my
note
tapes
excellent
hume
i
salute
a
new
colleague
at
last
right
hand
came
up
from
the
table
may
we
both
have
luck
equal
to
our
industry
luck
to
equal
our
desires
hume
corrected
him
a
very
telling
phrase
luck
to
equal
our
desires
yes
let
us
both
deserve
that
the
starfall
was
a
long
way
down
scale
from
the
pleasure
houses
of
the
upper
town
here
strange
vices
were
also
merchandise
but
not
such
exotics
as
wass
provided
this
was
strictly
for
crewmen
of
the
star
freighters
who
could
be
speedily
and
expertly
separated
from
a
voyage
pay
in
an
evening
the
tantalizing
scents
of
wass
terraces
were
reduced
here
to
simply
smells
the
majority
of
which
were
not
fragrant
there
had
already
been
two
fatal
duels
that
evening
a
tubeman
from
a
rim
ship
had
challenged
a
space
miner
to
settle
a
difference
with
those
vicious
whips
made
from
the
tail
casings
of
flangoid
flying
lizards
an
encounter
which
left
both
men
in
ribbons
one
dead
one
dying
and
a
scarred
marine
had
one
of
the
dealers
into
charred
human
ash
the
young
man
who
had
been
ordered
to
help
clear
away
the
second
loser
retired
to
the
stinking
alley
outside
to
lose
the
meal
which
was
part
of
his
meager
day
pay
now
he
crawled
back
inside
his
face
greenish
one
hand
pressed
to
his
middle
section
he
was
thin
the
fine
bones
of
his
face
tight
under
the
pallid
skin
his
ribs
showing
even
through
the
sleazy
fabric
of
the
threadbare
tunic
with
its
house
seal
when
he
leaned
his
head
back
against
the
grime
encrusted
wall
raising
his
face
to
the
light
his
hair
had
the
glint
of
bright
chestnut
a
gold
which
was
also
red
and
for
his
swamper
labor
he
was
almost
fastidiously
clean
you
lansor
he
shivered
as
if
an
icy
wind
had
found
him
and
opened
his
eyes
they
seemed
disproportionately
large
in
his
skin
and
bone
face
and
were
of
an
odd
shade
neither
green
nor
blue
but
somewhere
between
get
going
you
ai
paying
out
good
credits
for
you
to
sit
there
like
you
was
buying
on
your
own
the
salarkian
who
loomed
above
him
spoke
accentless
idiomatic
basic
space
which
came
strangely
from
between
his
yellow
lips
a
furred
hand
thrust
the
handle
of
a
stick
at
the
young
man
a
taloned
thumb
jerked
the
direction
in
which
to
use
that
object
vye
lansor
levered
himself
up
the
wall
took
the
mop
setting
his
teeth
grimly
someone
had
spilled
a
mug
of
kardo
and
the
deep
purple
liquid
was
already
patterning
the
floor
past
any
hope
of
cleaning
but
he
set
to
work
slapping
the
fringe
of
the
noisome
mop
back
and
forth
to
sop
up
what
he
could
the
smell
of
the
kardo
uniting
with
the
general
effluvia
of
the
room
and
its
inhabitants
heightened
his
queasiness
working
blindly
in
a
half
stupor
he
was
not
aware
of
the
man
sitting
alone
in
the
booth
until
his
mop
spattered
the
ankle
of
one
of
the
drinking
girls
she
struck
him
sharply
across
the
face
with
a
sputtering
curse
in
the
tongue
of
the
blow
sent
him
back
against
the
open
lattice
of
the
booth
as
he
tried
to
steady
himself
another
hand
reached
up
fingers
tightened
about
his
wrist
he
flinched
tried
to
jerk
away
from
that
hold
only
to
discover
that
he
was
the
other
prisoner
and
looking
down
at
his
captor
in
apprehension
he
was
aware
even
then
of
the
different
quality
of
this
man
the
patron
wore
the
tunic
of
a
crewman
lighter
patches
where
the
ship
badges
should
have
been
to
show
that
he
was
not
engaged
but
though
his
tunic
was
shabby
dirty
his
magnetic
boots
scuffed
and
badly
worn
he
was
not
like
the
others
now
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
the
starfall
this
one
he
makes
trouble
the
vast
bulk
of
the
who
was
the
starfall
private
law
moved
through
the
crowd
with
serene
confidence
in
his
own
strength
which
no
one
there
unless
blind
deaf
and
drunk
could
dispute
his
scaled
claw
hand
reached
out
for
lansor
and
the
boy
cringed
no
trouble
there
was
the
click
of
authority
in
the
voice
of
the
man
in
the
booth
his
face
moments
earlier
taut
and
sharp
with
intelligence
was
suddenly
slack
his
tone
slurred
as
he
answered
looks
like
an
old
shipmate
no
trouble
just
want
a
drink
with
an
old
shipmate
but
the
grip
which
had
pulled
vye
forward
swung
him
around
and
down
on
the
other
bench
in
the
booth
was
anything
but
slack
the
glanced
from
the
patron
of
the
starfall
to
its
least
important
employee
and
then
grinned
thrusting
his
fanged
jaws
close
to
lansor
if
the
master
wants
to
drink
you
you
drink
vye
nodded
vigorously
and
then
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
afraid
his
stomach
was
about
to
betray
him
again
apprehensive
he
watched
the
turn
away
only
when
that
broad
back
was
lost
in
the
smoky
far
reaches
of
the
room
did
he
expel
his
breath
again
here
the
grip
was
gone
from
his
wrist
but
fingers
now
put
a
mug
into
his
hand
drink
he
tried
to
protest
knew
it
was
hopeless
and
used
both
hands
to
get
the
mug
to
his
lips
mouthing
the
stinging
liquid
in
dull
despair
only
instead
of
bringing
nausea
with
it
the
stuff
settled
his
stomach
cleared
his
head
with
an
after
glow
with
which
he
managed
to
relax
from
the
tense
state
of
endurance
which
filled
his
hours
in
the
starfall
half
of
the
mug
contents
inside
him
and
he
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
to
the
man
opposite
him
yes
this
was
no
common
crewman
nor
was
he
drunk
as
he
had
pretended
for
the
now
he
watched
the
milling
crowd
with
a
kind
of
detachment
though
vye
was
sure
he
was
aware
of
every
move
he
himself
made
vye
finished
the
liquid
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
into
this
place
two
months
earlier
he
felt
like
a
real
person
again
and
he
had
wits
enough
to
guess
that
the
potion
he
had
just
swallowed
contained
some
drug
only
now
he
did
not
care
at
all
anything
which
could
wipe
out
in
moments
all
the
shame
fear
and
sick
despair
the
starfall
had
planted
in
him
was
worth
swallowing
why
the
other
had
drugged
him
was
a
mystery
but
he
was
content
to
wait
for
enlightenment
lansor
companion
once
more
applied
that
compelling
pressure
to
the
younger
man
bony
forearm
linked
by
that
hold
they
left
the
starfall
came
into
the
cooler
far
more
pleasant
atmosphere
of
the
street
they
were
a
block
away
before
vye
guide
halted
though
he
did
not
release
his
prisoner
forty
names
of
dugor
he
spat
lansor
waited
breathing
in
the
air
of
early
morning
the
confidence
of
the
drug
still
held
at
the
moment
he
was
certain
nothing
could
be
as
bad
as
the
life
behind
him
he
was
willing
to
face
what
this
strange
patron
of
the
starfall
had
in
mind
the
other
slapped
his
hand
down
on
an
call
button
stood
waiting
until
one
of
the
city
flitters
landed
on
beam
before
them
from
the
seat
of
the
vye
noted
they
were
heading
into
the
respectability
of
the
upper
city
away
from
the
stews
ringing
the
launch
port
he
tried
to
guess
their
destination
or
purpose
not
that
either
mattered
much
then
the
car
descended
on
a
landing
stage
the
stranger
waved
lansor
through
a
doorway
down
a
short
corridor
into
a
room
of
private
quarters
vye
sat
down
gingerly
on
the
foam
seat
extending
from
the
wall
as
he
neared
he
stared
about
dimly
he
could
just
remember
rooms
which
had
this
degree
of
comfort
but
so
dimly
now
he
could
not
be
sure
they
did
not
exist
only
in
his
vivid
imagination
for
vye
imagination
had
buoyed
him
first
through
the
drab
existence
in
a
state
child
crèche
then
through
a
job
which
he
had
lost
because
he
could
not
adapt
to
the
mechanical
life
of
a
computer
tender
and
had
been
an
anchor
and
an
escape
when
he
had
sunk
through
the
depths
of
the
port
to
the
last
refuge
in
the
starfall
now
he
pressed
both
his
hands
into
the
soft
stuff
of
the
seat
and
gaped
at
a
small
on
the
wall
facing
him
a
miniature
scene
of
life
on
some
other
planet
wherein
a
creature
enveloped
in
short
black
and
white
striped
fur
crept
belly
flat
to
stalk
birds
making
splotches
against
yellow
reed
banks
under
a
pale
violet
sky
he
feasted
on
its
color
on
the
sense
of
freedom
and
wonders
which
it
raised
in
him
who
are
you
the
stranger
abrupt
question
brought
him
back
not
only
to
the
room
but
to
his
own
precarious
position
he
moistened
his
lips
no
longer
quite
so
aglow
with
confidence
vye
vye
lansor
then
he
added
his
other
identification
c
state
child
eh
the
other
had
pushed
a
button
for
a
refresher
cup
then
was
sipping
its
contents
slowly
he
did
not
ring
for
a
second
to
offer
vye
parents
lansor
shook
his
head
i
was
brought
in
after
the
fever
epidemic
they
did
try
to
keep
records
there
were
too
many
of
us
the
man
was
watching
him
levelly
over
the
rim
of
that
cup
there
was
something
cold
in
that
study
something
which
curbed
vye
pleasant
feeling
of
only
moments
earlier
now
the
other
set
down
his
drink
crossed
the
room
cupping
his
hand
under
lansor
chin
he
brought
up
his
head
in
a
way
which
stirred
a
sullen
resentment
in
the
younger
man
yet
something
told
him
resistance
would
only
bring
trouble
i
say
terran
stock
not
more
than
second
generation
he
was
talking
to
himself
more
than
to
vye
he
loosed
his
hold
on
the
chin
but
he
still
stood
there
surveying
him
from
head
to
foot
lansor
wanted
to
squirm
but
he
fought
that
impulse
and
managed
to
meet
the
other
gaze
when
it
reached
his
face
again
no
not
the
usual
i
was
right
all
the
way
now
he
looked
at
vye
again
as
if
the
younger
man
did
have
a
brain
emotions
some
call
on
his
interest
as
a
personality
want
a
job
lansor
pressed
his
hand
deeper
into
the
foam
seat
what
what
kind
he
was
angry
and
ashamed
at
that
small
betraying
break
in
his
voice
you
have
scruples
the
stranger
appeared
to
think
that
amusing
vye
reddened
but
he
was
also
more
than
a
little
surprised
that
the
man
in
the
worn
space
uniform
had
read
hesitancy
right
someone
out
of
the
starfall
should
not
be
too
particular
about
employment
and
he
could
not
tell
why
he
was
nothing
illegal
i
assure
you
the
man
crossed
to
set
his
refresher
cup
in
the
empty
slot
i
am
an
lansor
blinked
this
had
all
taken
on
some
of
the
fantastic
aura
of
a
dream
the
other
was
eyeing
him
impatiently
as
if
he
had
expected
some
reaction
you
may
inspect
my
credentials
if
you
wish
i
believe
you
vye
found
his
voice
i
happen
to
need
a
gearman
but
this
was
happening
of
course
it
could
happen
to
him
vye
lansor
state
child
swamper
in
the
starfall
things
such
as
this
did
not
happen
except
in
a
thaline
dream
and
he
was
a
smoke
eater
it
was
the
kind
of
dream
a
man
did
want
to
wake
from
not
if
he
was
would
you
be
willing
to
sign
on
vye
tried
to
clutch
reality
to
himself
to
remain
a
gearman
for
an
why
five
men
out
of
six
would
pay
a
large
premium
for
a
chance
at
such
rating
the
chill
of
doubt
cut
through
the
first
hazy
rosiness
a
swamper
from
a
dive
simply
did
not
become
a
gearman
for
a
guild
hunter
again
it
was
as
if
the
stranger
read
his
thoughts
look
here
he
spoke
abruptly
i
had
a
bad
time
myself
years
ago
you
resemble
someone
to
whom
i
owe
a
debt
i
ca
repay
him
but
i
can
make
the
scales
a
little
even
this
way
make
the
scales
even
vye
fading
hope
brightened
then
the
was
a
follower
of
the
fata
rite
that
would
explain
everything
if
you
could
not
repay
a
good
deed
to
the
one
you
owed
you
must
balance
the
eternal
scales
in
another
fashion
he
relaxed
again
a
great
many
of
his
unasked
questions
so
answered
you
will
accept
vye
nodded
eagerly
yes
he
still
could
not
believe
that
this
was
happening
the
other
pressed
the
refresher
button
and
this
time
he
handed
lansor
the
brimming
cup
drink
on
the
bargain
his
words
had
the
ring
of
command
lansor
drank
gulping
down
the
contents
of
the
cup
and
suddenly
was
aware
of
being
tired
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
his
eyes
closed
ras
hume
took
the
cup
from
the
lax
fingers
of
the
young
man
so
far
very
good
chance
appeared
to
be
playing
on
his
side
of
the
board
it
had
been
chance
which
had
steered
him
into
the
starfall
just
three
nights
ago
when
he
had
been
in
quest
of
his
imposter
and
vye
lansor
was
better
than
he
dared
hope
to
find
the
boy
had
the
right
coloring
he
had
been
batted
around
enough
to
fall
for
the
initial
story
he
was
malleable
now
and
after
wass
techs
worked
on
him
he
would
be
rynch
brodie
heir
to
of
come
he
touched
vye
on
the
shoulder
the
boy
opened
his
eyes
but
his
gaze
did
not
focus
as
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
hume
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
still
very
early
the
chance
he
must
run
in
getting
lansor
out
of
this
building
was
small
if
they
went
at
once
guiding
the
younger
man
with
a
light
hold
above
the
elbow
he
walked
him
out
back
to
the
flitter
landing
stage
the
was
waiting
hume
sense
of
being
a
gambler
facing
a
run
of
good
luck
grew
as
he
shepherded
the
boy
into
the
flitter
punched
a
cover
destination
and
took
off
on
another
street
he
transferred
himself
and
his
charge
into
a
second
set
the
destination
to
within
a
block
of
the
address
wass
had
given
him
not
much
later
he
walked
vye
into
a
small
lobby
with
a
discreet
list
of
names
posted
in
its
rack
no
occupations
attached
to
those
colored
streamers
hume
noted
this
meant
either
that
their
owners
represented
luxury
trades
where
a
name
signified
the
profession
or
service
or
that
they
were
covers
perhaps
both
world
fringed
many
different
circles
intermingled
with
some
quite
surprising
professions
dedicated
to
the
comfort
pleasure
or
health
of
the
idle
rich
nobility
and
the
criminal
elite
hume
fingered
the
right
call
button
knowing
that
the
thumb
pattern
he
had
left
on
wass
conference
table
would
have
already
been
relayed
as
his
symbol
of
admission
here
a
flicker
of
light
winked
below
the
name
the
wall
to
the
right
shimmered
and
produced
a
doorway
steering
vye
to
it
hume
nodded
to
the
man
waiting
there
he
was
a
eucorian
of
the
servant
caste
and
now
he
reached
out
to
draw
lansor
over
the
threshold
i
have
him
gentlehomo
his
voice
was
as
expressionless
as
his
face
there
was
another
shimmer
and
the
door
disappeared
hume
brushed
his
hand
down
the
outer
side
of
his
thigh
wiping
flesh
against
the
coarse
stuff
of
the
crew
uniform
he
left
the
lobby
frowning
at
his
own
thoughts
stupid
a
swamper
from
one
of
the
worst
rat
holes
in
the
port
like
as
not
that
youngster
would
have
had
his
brains
kicked
out
in
a
brawl
or
been
fried
to
a
crisp
when
some
drunk
got
wild
with
a
blaster
before
the
year
was
out
he
done
him
a
real
kindness
given
him
a
chance
at
a
future
less
than
one
man
in
a
billion
ever
had
the
power
to
even
dream
about
why
if
vye
lansor
had
known
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
he
would
have
been
so
willing
to
volunteer
that
he
would
have
dragged
hume
here
there
was
no
reason
to
have
any
regrets
over
the
boy
he
had
never
had
it
so
good
never
there
was
only
one
small
period
of
risk
for
vye
to
face
those
days
he
would
have
to
spend
alone
on
jumala
between
the
time
wass
organization
would
plant
him
there
and
the
coming
of
hume
party
to
discover
him
hume
himself
would
tape
every
possible
aid
to
cover
that
period
all
the
knowledge
of
a
guild
added
to
the
information
gathered
by
the
survey
would
be
used
to
provide
rynch
brodie
with
the
training
necessary
for
wilderness
survival
hume
was
already
listing
the
items
to
be
included
as
he
strode
down
the
street
his
tread
once
more
assured
his
head
ached
dully
of
that
he
was
conscious
first
as
he
turned
without
opening
his
eyes
he
felt
the
brush
of
softness
against
his
cheek
and
a
pungent
odor
fill
his
nostrils
he
opened
his
eyes
stared
up
past
a
rim
of
broken
rock
toward
the
cloudless
sky
a
relay
clicked
into
proper
place
deep
in
his
mind
of
course
he
had
been
trying
to
lure
a
out
of
its
traphole
with
hooked
bait
then
his
foot
had
slipped
rynch
brodie
sat
up
flexed
his
bare
thin
arms
and
moved
his
long
legs
experimentally
no
broken
bones
anyway
but
still
he
frowned
odd
that
dream
which
jarred
with
the
here
and
now
crawling
to
the
side
of
the
creek
he
dipped
head
and
shoulders
into
the
water
letting
the
chill
of
the
stream
flush
away
some
of
his
waking
bewilderment
he
shook
himself
making
the
drops
fly
from
his
uncovered
torso
and
arms
and
then
discovered
his
hunting
tackle
he
stood
for
a
moment
fingering
each
piece
of
his
scanty
clothing
recalling
every
piece
of
labor
or
battle
which
had
added
pouch
belt
strip
of
fabric
to
his
equipment
yet
there
was
still
that
odd
sense
of
strangeness
as
if
none
of
this
was
really
his
rynch
shook
his
head
wiped
his
wet
face
with
his
arm
it
was
all
his
that
was
sure
every
bit
of
it
he
been
lucky
the
survival
manual
on
the
had
furnished
him
with
general
directions
and
this
was
a
world
which
was
not
unfriendly
not
if
one
was
prepared
for
trouble
he
climbed
up
and
loosened
the
net
coiling
its
folds
into
one
hand
taking
the
good
spear
in
his
other
a
bush
stirred
ahead
against
the
pull
of
the
light
breeze
rynch
froze
then
the
haft
of
his
spear
slid
into
a
new
hand
grip
the
coils
of
his
net
spun
out
a
snarl
cut
over
the
purr
of
water
the
scarlet
blot
which
sprang
for
his
throat
was
met
with
the
flail
of
the
net
rynch
stabbed
twice
at
the
creature
he
had
so
swept
off
balance
a
this
year
cub
dying
its
claws
in
proportion
to
its
paws
drew
inch
deep
furrows
in
the
earth
and
gravel
its
eyes
almost
the
same
shade
as
its
long
body
fur
glared
up
at
him
in
deathly
enmity
as
rynch
watched
that
feeling
that
he
was
studying
something
strange
utterly
alien
came
to
him
once
again
yet
he
had
hunted
for
many
seasons
fortunately
they
were
solitary
beasts
that
marked
out
a
roaming
territory
to
defend
it
from
others
of
their
kind
and
not
too
many
were
to
be
encountered
in
travel
he
stooped
to
pull
his
net
from
the
now
still
paws
some
definite
place
he
must
reach
the
compulsion
to
move
on
in
that
sudden
flash
shook
him
raised
the
dull
ache
still
troubling
his
temples
into
a
punishing
throb
going
down
on
his
knees
rynch
once
more
turned
to
the
stream
water
this
time
after
splashing
it
onto
his
face
he
drank
from
his
cupped
hands
rynch
swayed
his
wet
hands
over
his
eyes
digging
fingertips
into
the
skin
of
his
forehead
to
ease
that
pain
bursting
in
his
skull
sitting
in
a
room
drinking
from
a
cup
it
was
as
if
a
shadow
picture
fitted
over
the
reality
of
the
stream
rocks
and
brush
about
him
he
had
sat
in
a
room
had
drank
from
a
cup
that
action
had
been
important
a
sharp
hot
pain
made
him
lose
contact
with
that
shadow
he
looked
down
from
the
gravel
from
under
rocks
gathered
an
army
of
things
their
clawed
forelimbs
extended
blue
sense
organs
raised
on
fleshy
stalks
well
above
their
heads
all
turned
towards
the
dead
feline
rynch
slapped
out
vigorously
stumbled
into
the
water
loosening
the
hold
of
two
vicious
scavengers
on
the
torn
skin
of
his
ankle
when
he
waded
out
already
that
black
tongue
of
small
bodies
licked
across
the
side
of
the
hunter
within
minutes
the
corpse
would
be
only
bones
retrieving
his
spear
and
net
rynch
immersed
both
in
the
water
to
clean
off
attackers
and
hurried
on
splashing
through
the
creek
until
he
was
well
away
from
the
vicinity
of
the
kill
a
little
later
he
flushed
a
creature
from
between
two
rocks
and
killed
it
with
one
blow
from
his
spear
haft
he
skinned
his
kill
feeling
the
substance
of
the
skill
was
it
exceedingly
rough
hide
or
rudimentary
scales
and
knew
a
return
of
that
puzzlement
he
felt
he
thought
painfully
as
he
toasted
the
dry
looking
grayish
meat
on
a
sharpened
stick
as
if
a
part
of
him
knew
very
well
what
manner
of
animal
he
had
killed
and
yet
far
inside
him
another
person
he
could
not
understand
stood
aloof
watching
in
amazement
he
was
rynch
brodie
and
he
had
been
traveling
on
the
largo
drift
with
his
mother
memory
presented
him
automatically
with
a
picture
of
a
thin
woman
with
a
narrow
rather
unhappy
face
a
twist
of
elaborately
dressed
hair
in
which
jeweled
lights
sparkled
there
had
been
something
bad
memory
was
no
longer
exact
but
chaotic
and
his
head
ached
as
he
tried
to
recall
that
time
with
greater
clarity
afterwards
the
and
a
man
with
him
in
it
simmons
tait
an
officer
badly
hurt
he
had
died
when
the
landed
here
rynch
had
a
clear
memory
of
himself
piling
rocks
over
tait
twisted
body
he
had
been
alone
then
with
only
the
survival
manual
and
some
of
the
supplies
the
important
thing
was
that
he
must
never
forget
he
was
rynch
brodie
he
licked
grease
from
his
fingers
the
ache
in
his
head
made
him
drowsy
he
curled
up
on
a
patch
of
sand
and
slept
or
did
he
his
eyes
were
open
again
now
the
sky
above
him
was
no
longer
a
bowl
of
light
but
rather
a
muted
halo
of
evening
rynch
sat
up
his
heart
pounding
as
if
he
had
been
racing
to
outdistance
the
rising
wind
now
pushing
against
his
body
what
was
he
doing
here
where
here
panic
carried
through
from
that
awakening
dried
his
mouth
roughened
his
skin
made
wet
the
palms
of
the
hands
he
dug
into
the
sand
on
either
side
of
him
vaguely
a
picture
projected
into
his
mind
he
had
sat
in
a
room
and
watched
a
man
come
to
him
with
a
cup
before
that
he
had
been
in
a
place
of
garish
light
and
evil
smells
but
he
was
rynch
brodie
he
had
come
here
on
an
when
he
was
a
boy
he
had
buried
the
ship
officer
under
a
pile
of
rocks
managed
to
survive
by
himself
because
he
had
applied
the
aids
in
the
boat
to
learn
how
this
morning
he
had
been
hunting
a
tempting
it
out
of
its
hiding
by
a
hook
and
line
and
a
bait
of
fresh
killed
skipper
rynch
hands
went
to
his
face
he
crouched
forward
on
his
knees
that
all
was
true
he
could
prove
it
he
would
prove
it
there
was
the
den
back
there
somewhere
on
the
rise
where
he
had
left
the
snapped
haft
of
the
spear
he
had
broken
in
his
fall
if
he
could
find
the
den
then
he
would
be
sure
of
the
reality
of
everything
else
he
had
only
had
a
very
real
dream
that
was
it
only
why
did
he
continue
to
dream
of
that
room
that
man
and
the
cup
of
the
place
of
lights
and
smells
which
he
hated
so
much
that
the
hate
was
a
sour
taste
in
his
mouth
none
of
it
had
ever
been
a
part
of
rynch
brodie
world
through
the
dusk
he
started
back
up
the
stream
bed
towards
the
narrow
little
valley
where
he
had
wakened
after
that
fall
finally
finding
shelter
within
the
heart
of
a
bush
he
crouched
low
listening
to
the
noises
of
another
world
which
awoke
at
night
to
take
over
the
stage
from
the
day
dwellers
as
he
plodded
back
he
fought
off
panic
realizing
that
some
of
those
noises
he
could
identify
with
confidence
while
others
remained
mysteries
he
bit
down
hard
on
the
knuckles
of
his
clenched
fist
attempting
to
bend
that
discovery
into
evidence
why
did
he
know
at
once
that
that
thin
eerie
wailing
was
the
flock
call
of
a
feathered
tree
dweller
and
that
a
coughing
grunt
from
downstream
was
just
a
noise
rynch
brodie
largo
drift
tait
he
tasted
the
blood
his
teeth
drew
from
his
own
skin
as
he
recited
that
formula
then
he
scrambled
up
his
feet
tangled
in
the
net
and
he
went
down
again
his
head
cracking
on
a
protruding
root
nothing
tangible
reached
him
in
that
brush
shelter
what
did
venture
out
of
hiding
to
investigate
was
a
substance
none
of
his
species
could
have
named
it
was
neither
body
nor
mind
perhaps
it
was
closest
to
alien
emotion
making
contact
stealthily
but
with
confidence
it
explored
after
its
own
fashion
then
puzzled
it
withdrew
to
report
and
since
that
to
which
it
reported
was
governed
by
a
set
pattern
which
had
not
been
altered
for
eons
its
only
answer
was
a
basic
command
reaffirmed
again
it
made
contact
strove
to
carry
out
that
order
fruitlessly
where
it
should
have
found
easy
passage
a
clear
channel
to
carry
influence
to
the
sleeper
brain
it
found
a
jumble
of
impressions
interwoven
until
they
made
a
protective
barrier
the
invader
strove
to
find
some
pattern
or
meaning
withdrew
baffled
but
its
invasion
as
ghostly
as
that
had
been
loosened
a
knot
here
cleared
a
passage
there
rynch
awoke
at
dawn
slowly
dazedly
sorting
out
sounds
smells
thoughts
there
was
a
room
a
man
trouble
and
fear
then
there
was
he
rynch
brodie
who
had
lived
in
this
wilderness
on
an
unmapped
frontier
world
for
the
passage
of
many
seasons
that
world
was
about
him
now
he
could
feel
its
winds
hear
its
sounds
taste
smell
it
was
not
a
dream
the
other
was
the
dream
it
had
to
be
prove
it
find
the
retrace
the
trail
of
yesterday
past
the
point
of
the
fall
which
had
started
all
this
right
there
was
the
slope
down
which
he
must
have
tumbled
above
he
would
find
the
den
he
had
been
exploring
when
the
accident
had
occurred
only
he
did
not
find
it
his
mind
had
produced
a
detailed
picture
of
that
rounded
depression
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
lurked
but
when
he
reached
the
crown
of
the
bluff
nowhere
did
he
sight
the
mounded
earth
of
the
pit
rim
he
searched
carefully
for
a
good
length
both
north
and
south
no
den
no
trace
of
one
yet
his
memory
told
him
that
there
had
been
one
here
yesterday
had
he
fallen
elsewhere
and
stumbled
on
dazed
to
fall
a
second
time
some
disputant
inside
him
said
no
to
that
this
was
where
he
had
regained
consciousness
yesterday
and
there
was
no
den
he
faced
away
from
the
river
breathing
fast
no
den
was
there
also
no
if
he
had
passed
this
way
dazed
from
a
former
fall
surely
he
would
have
left
some
trace
there
was
a
crushed
browned
plant
flattened
by
weight
he
stooped
to
finger
the
wilted
leaves
something
had
come
in
this
direction
he
would
rynch
gave
a
hunter
attention
to
the
ground
a
later
he
found
nothing
but
some
odd
almost
obliterated
marks
on
grass
too
resilient
to
hold
traces
very
long
and
from
them
he
could
make
nothing
he
knew
where
he
was
even
if
he
did
not
know
how
he
got
here
the
if
it
did
exist
was
to
the
west
he
had
a
vivid
mental
picture
of
the
rocket
shape
its
once
silvery
sides
dulled
by
exposure
canted
crookedly
amid
trees
and
he
was
going
to
find
it
beyond
the
edge
of
any
conscious
sense
there
was
a
new
stir
he
was
contacted
again
tested
a
forest
called
delicately
in
its
alien
way
rynch
had
a
fleeting
thought
of
trees
was
not
aware
of
more
than
a
mild
desire
to
see
what
lay
in
their
shade
for
the
present
his
own
problem
held
him
that
which
beckoned
was
defeated
repulsed
by
his
indifference
while
rynch
started
at
a
steady
distance
to
trot
towards
the
east
far
away
a
process
akin
to
a
relay
clicked
into
a
second
set
of
impulse
orders
well
above
the
planet
hume
spun
a
dial
to
bring
in
the
image
of
the
wide
stretches
of
continents
the
small
patches
of
seas
they
would
set
down
on
the
western
land
mass
its
climate
geographical
features
and
surface
provided
the
best
site
and
he
had
the
very
important
for
their
camp
already
taped
in
the
directo
that
jumala
he
did
not
glance
around
to
see
what
effect
that
screen
view
had
on
the
other
four
men
in
the
control
cabin
of
the
safari
ship
just
now
he
was
striving
to
master
his
impatience
the
slightest
hint
could
give
birth
to
a
suspicion
which
would
blast
their
whole
scheme
wass
might
have
had
a
hand
in
the
selection
of
the
three
clients
but
they
would
certainly
be
far
from
briefed
on
the
truth
of
any
discovery
made
on
jumala
they
had
to
be
for
the
safety
of
the
whole
enterprise
the
fourth
man
serving
as
his
gearman
for
this
trip
was
wass
own
insurance
against
any
wrong
move
on
hume
part
and
the
respected
him
as
being
man
enough
to
be
wary
of
giving
any
suspicion
of
going
counter
to
the
agreed
plan
dawn
was
touching
up
the
main
points
of
the
western
continent
and
he
must
set
this
spacer
down
within
a
day
journey
of
the
abandoned
exploration
in
that
direction
would
be
the
first
logical
move
for
his
party
they
could
not
be
openly
steered
to
the
find
but
there
were
ways
of
directing
a
hunt
which
would
do
as
well
two
days
ago
according
to
schedule
their
castaway
had
been
deposited
here
with
a
command
to
remain
in
the
general
area
there
had
been
a
slight
element
of
risk
in
leaving
him
alone
armed
only
with
the
crude
weapons
he
could
manipulate
but
that
was
part
of
the
gamble
they
were
down
right
on
the
mark
hume
saw
to
the
unpacking
and
activating
of
those
machines
and
appliances
which
would
protect
and
serve
his
civ
clients
he
slapped
the
last
inflate
valve
on
a
bubble
tent
watched
it
critically
as
it
billowed
from
a
small
roll
of
fabric
into
a
weather
resistant
and
heated
shelter
ready
and
waiting
for
you
to
move
in
gentlehomo
he
reported
to
the
small
man
who
stood
gazing
about
him
with
a
child
wondering
interest
in
the
new
and
strange
very
ingenious
hunter
ah
now
just
what
might
that
be
his
voice
was
also
eager
as
he
pointed
a
finger
to
the
east
hume
glanced
up
alertly
there
was
a
bare
chance
that
brodie
might
have
witnessed
their
arrival
and
might
be
coming
in
now
to
save
them
all
a
great
amount
of
time
and
trouble
by
acting
the
overjoyed
rescued
castaway
but
he
could
sight
nothing
at
all
in
that
direction
to
excite
any
attention
the
distant
mountains
provided
a
stark
dark
blue
background
up
their
foothills
and
lower
slopes
was
a
thick
furring
of
trees
with
foliage
of
so
deep
a
green
as
to
register
black
from
this
distance
and
on
the
level
country
was
the
lighter
of
the
other
variety
of
wood
edging
the
open
country
about
the
river
in
there
rested
the
i
do
see
anything
he
snapped
so
sharply
the
little
man
stared
at
him
in
open
surprise
hume
forced
a
quick
smile
just
what
did
you
sight
gentlehomo
starns
there
is
no
large
game
in
the
woodlands
this
was
not
an
animal
hunter
rather
a
flash
of
light
just
about
there
again
he
pointed
sun
hume
thought
could
have
been
reflected
from
some
portion
of
the
he
had
believed
that
small
spacer
so
covered
with
vines
and
ringed
in
by
trees
that
it
could
not
have
been
so
sighted
but
a
storm
might
have
disposed
of
some
of
nature
cloaking
if
so
interest
must
be
fed
he
would
make
an
ideal
discoverer
odd
hume
produced
his
distance
glasses
just
where
gentlehomo
there
starns
obligingly
pointed
a
third
time
if
there
had
been
anything
to
see
it
was
gone
now
but
it
did
lie
in
the
right
direction
for
a
second
or
two
hume
was
uneasy
things
seemed
to
be
working
too
well
his
cynical
distrust
was
triggered
by
fitting
so
smoothly
might
be
the
sun
he
observed
reflected
from
some
object
you
mean
hunter
but
the
flash
was
very
bright
and
there
could
be
no
mirror
surface
in
there
surely
there
could
not
be
yes
things
were
moving
too
fast
hume
might
be
overly
cautious
but
he
was
determined
that
no
hint
of
any
of
the
must
ever
come
to
these
civs
when
they
would
find
the
largo
drift
life
boat
and
locate
brodie
there
would
be
a
legal
snarl
the
identity
would
be
challenged
by
a
half
dozen
distant
and
unloving
relatives
and
there
would
be
an
intense
inquiry
these
civs
must
be
the
impartial
witnesses
no
i
hardly
believe
in
a
mirror
in
an
uninhabited
forest
gentlehomo
he
chuckled
but
we
are
on
a
hunting
planet
and
not
all
its
life
forms
have
yet
been
classified
you
are
thinking
of
an
intelligent
native
race
hunter
chambriss
the
most
demanding
of
the
civ
party
strode
up
to
join
them
hume
shook
his
head
no
native
intelligence
on
a
hunting
world
gentlehomo
that
is
assured
before
the
planet
is
listed
for
a
safari
however
a
bird
or
flying
thing
perhaps
with
metallic
plumage
or
scales
to
catch
the
sunlight
might
under
the
right
circumstances
seem
a
flash
of
light
that
has
happened
before
it
was
bright
starns
said
doubtfully
we
might
look
over
there
later
nonsense
chambriss
spoke
briskly
as
one
used
to
overriding
the
conflicting
wishes
in
any
company
i
came
here
for
a
and
a
i
going
to
have
you
do
find
those
in
wooded
areas
there
will
be
a
schedule
hume
announced
each
of
you
has
signed
up
according
to
contract
for
a
different
trophy
you
for
a
gentlehomo
and
you
gentlehomo
starns
want
to
make
of
the
while
gentlehomo
yactisi
wishes
to
try
electo
fishing
in
the
deep
holes
to
alternate
days
is
the
fair
way
and
who
knows
each
of
you
may
discover
your
own
choice
near
the
other
man
stake
out
you
are
quite
right
hunter
starns
nodded
and
since
my
two
colleagues
have
chosen
to
try
for
a
water
creature
perhaps
we
should
start
along
the
river
it
was
two
days
then
before
they
could
work
their
way
into
the
woods
one
part
of
hume
protested
the
more
cautious
section
of
his
mind
was
appeased
he
saw
beyond
the
three
clients
now
turning
over
and
sorting
space
bags
wass
man
glanced
at
the
woods
and
then
back
to
starns
and
being
acutely
aware
of
all
undercurrents
here
hume
wondered
what
the
small
civ
had
actually
seen
the
camp
was
complete
a
cluster
of
seven
bubble
tents
not
too
far
from
the
ship
at
least
this
crowd
did
not
appear
to
consider
that
the
hunter
was
there
to
do
all
the
serious
moving
and
storing
of
supplies
all
three
of
the
clients
pitched
in
to
help
and
wass
man
went
down
to
the
river
to
return
with
half
a
dozen
cleaned
and
threaded
on
a
reed
ready
to
broil
over
the
cook
unit
a
fire
in
the
night
was
not
needed
except
to
afford
the
proper
stage
setting
but
it
was
enjoyed
hume
leaned
forward
to
feed
the
flames
and
starns
pushed
some
lengths
of
driftwood
closer
you
have
said
hunter
that
hunting
worlds
never
contain
intelligent
native
life
unless
the
planet
is
minutely
explored
how
can
your
survey
teams
be
sure
of
that
fact
his
voice
bordered
on
the
pedantic
but
his
interest
was
plain
by
using
the
verifier
hume
sat
crosslegged
his
resting
on
one
knee
fifty
years
ago
we
would
have
had
to
keep
rather
a
lengthy
watch
to
be
sure
of
a
free
world
now
we
plant
verifiers
at
suitable
test
points
intelligence
means
mental
activity
of
some
sort
any
of
which
would
be
recorded
on
the
verifier
amazing
starns
extended
his
plump
hands
to
the
flames
in
the
immemorial
gesture
of
a
human
attracted
not
only
to
the
warmth
of
the
burning
wood
but
to
its
promise
of
security
against
the
forces
of
the
dark
no
matter
how
few
or
how
scattered
your
native
thinkers
may
be
you
record
them
without
missing
any
hume
shrugged
maybe
one
or
two
he
grinned
might
get
through
such
a
screening
but
we
have
yet
to
discover
a
planet
with
such
a
sparse
native
life
as
that
at
the
level
of
intelligence
yactisi
juggled
a
cup
in
and
out
of
the
firelight
i
agree
this
is
most
interesting
he
was
a
thin
man
with
scanty
drab
gray
hair
and
dark
skin
perhaps
the
result
of
the
mingling
of
several
human
races
his
eyes
were
slightly
sunken
so
that
it
was
difficult
in
this
light
to
read
their
expression
he
was
hume
had
already
decided
a
class
one
brain
and
observant
to
a
degree
which
could
either
be
a
help
or
a
menace
there
have
been
no
cases
of
failure
none
reported
hume
returned
all
his
life
he
had
relied
on
machines
operating
of
course
under
the
competent
domination
of
men
trained
to
use
them
properly
he
understood
the
process
of
the
verifier
had
seen
it
at
work
at
the
guild
headquarters
there
were
no
records
of
its
failure
he
was
willing
to
believe
it
was
infallible
a
race
residing
in
the
sea
now
could
you
be
sure
your
machine
would
discover
its
presence
starns
continued
to
question
hume
laughed
not
to
be
found
on
jumala
you
may
be
sure
of
that
the
seas
here
are
small
and
shallow
such
not
to
be
picked
up
by
the
verifier
would
have
to
exist
at
great
depths
and
never
venture
on
land
so
we
need
not
fear
any
surprises
here
the
guild
takes
no
chances
as
it
always
continues
to
assure
one
yactisi
replied
the
hour
grows
late
i
wish
you
rewarding
dreams
he
arose
to
go
to
his
own
bubble
tent
yes
indeed
starns
blinked
at
the
fire
and
then
scrambled
up
in
turn
we
hunt
along
the
river
then
tomorrow
for
hume
agreed
of
the
three
he
believed
chambriss
the
most
impatient
might
as
well
let
him
pot
his
trophy
as
soon
as
possible
the
deduced
there
would
be
little
cooperation
in
exploration
from
that
client
until
he
was
satisfied
in
his
own
quest
rovald
wass
man
lingered
by
the
fire
until
the
three
civs
were
safe
in
their
bubbles
river
range
tomorrow
he
asked
yes
we
ca
rush
the
deal
agreed
rovald
spoke
with
a
curtness
he
did
not
use
when
the
civs
were
present
only
do
delay
too
long
remember
our
boy
roaming
around
out
there
he
might
just
be
picked
off
by
something
before
these
civs
catch
up
with
him
that
the
chance
we
knew
we
have
to
take
we
do
dare
raise
any
suspicion
yactisi
for
one
is
no
fool
neither
is
starns
chambriss
just
wants
to
get
his
but
he
could
become
nasty
if
anyone
tried
to
steer
him
too
long
a
wait
might
run
us
into
trouble
wass
does
like
trouble
hume
spun
around
in
the
half
light
of
the
fire
his
features
were
set
his
mouth
grim
neither
do
i
rovald
neither
do
i
he
said
softly
but
with
an
icy
promise
beneath
the
words
rovald
was
not
to
be
intimidated
he
grinned
set
your
fins
down
you
need
wass
and
i
here
to
hold
his
stakes
for
him
this
is
a
big
deal
we
wo
want
any
misses
there
wo
be
any
not
from
my
side
hume
stepped
away
from
the
fire
approached
a
post
which
gleamed
with
a
dull
red
line
of
fire
down
either
side
he
pressed
a
control
button
that
red
line
flared
into
a
streak
of
brilliance
now
encircling
the
bubble
tents
and
the
space
ship
was
a
force
field
routine
protection
of
a
safari
camp
on
a
strange
world
and
one
hume
had
set
as
a
matter
of
course
he
stood
for
a
long
moment
staring
through
that
invisible
barrier
toward
the
direction
of
the
wood
it
was
a
dark
night
there
were
scudding
clouds
to
hide
the
stars
which
meant
rain
probably
before
morning
this
was
no
time
to
be
plagued
by
uncertain
weather
somewhere
out
there
brodie
was
holed
up
he
hoped
the
boy
had
long
ago
reached
the
camp
so
carefully
erected
and
left
for
his
occupancy
the
that
stone
covered
grave
showing
signs
of
several
occupancy
was
all
assembled
and
constructed
to
the
last
small
detail
far
less
might
have
deceived
the
civs
in
this
safari
but
as
soon
as
the
story
of
their
find
leaked
there
would
be
others
on
the
scene
men
trained
to
assess
the
signs
of
a
castaway
fight
for
survival
his
own
guild
training
and
the
ability
of
wass
renegade
techs
should
bring
them
through
that
test
what
had
starns
seen
the
glint
of
sun
on
the
tail
of
the
tilted
now
to
the
sky
hume
walked
slowly
back
to
the
fire
when
he
saw
rovald
going
up
the
ramp
into
the
spacer
he
smiled
did
wass
think
he
was
stupid
enough
not
to
guess
that
the
veep
man
would
be
in
com
touch
with
his
employer
rovald
was
about
to
report
along
some
channel
of
the
shadow
world
that
they
had
landed
and
that
the
play
was
about
to
begin
hume
wondered
idly
how
far
and
through
how
many
relays
that
message
would
pass
before
it
reached
its
destination
he
stretched
and
yawned
moving
to
his
sleeping
pad
tomorrow
they
must
find
chambriss
a
hume
shoved
brodie
into
the
back
of
his
mind
to
center
his
thoughts
on
the
various
ways
of
delivering
to
the
waiting
sportsman
a
alien
feline
the
lights
in
the
bubbles
went
out
one
by
one
within
the
circle
barrier
of
the
force
field
men
slept
and
by
midnight
the
rain
began
to
fall
streaming
down
the
sides
of
the
bubbles
soaking
the
ashes
of
the
fire
out
of
the
dark
crept
that
which
was
not
thought
not
substance
but
alien
to
the
men
but
the
barrier
meant
to
deter
creatures
with
wings
or
no
visible
limbs
at
all
proved
to
be
a
better
protection
than
its
creators
had
hoped
there
was
no
penetration
only
a
baffled
butting
of
one
force
against
another
and
then
the
probe
withdrew
as
undetected
as
it
had
come
only
the
thing
which
had
no
intelligence
as
humankind
rated
intelligence
did
possess
the
ability
to
fathom
the
nature
of
that
artificial
barrier
the
force
field
was
examined
its
nature
digested
first
approach
had
failed
the
second
was
now
ready
ready
as
it
had
not
been
months
before
when
the
first
coming
of
these
creatures
had
alerted
the
very
ancient
watchdog
on
jumala
deep
in
the
darker
woods
on
the
mountain
sides
there
was
a
stirring
things
whimpered
in
their
sleep
protested
subconsciously
commands
they
could
never
understand
only
obey
with
the
coming
of
dawn
there
would
be
a
marshaling
of
hosts
a
new
assault
not
on
the
camp
but
on
any
leaving
its
protection
and
also
on
the
boy
now
sleeping
in
a
shallow
cave
formed
by
the
swept
roots
of
a
tree
a
tree
which
had
crashed
when
the
landed
again
fortune
favored
hume
with
the
dawn
the
rain
was
over
there
was
a
cloudy
sky
overhead
but
he
believed
the
day
would
clear
the
roily
rushing
water
of
the
river
would
aid
chambriss
quest
holed
up
in
the
banks
but
rising
water
often
forced
them
out
of
such
dens
a
course
parallel
to
the
stream
bed
could
well
show
them
the
tracks
of
one
of
the
felines
they
started
off
in
a
group
hume
leading
with
chambriss
treading
briskly
behind
him
rovald
bringing
up
the
rear
in
the
approved
trail
technique
chambriss
carried
a
needler

for
a
small

his
box
slung
on
his
chest
by
carrying
straps
yactisi
shouldered
an
electric
pole
wore
its
control
belt
buckled
about
his
middle
though
hume
had
warned
him
that
the
storm
would
prevent
any
deep
hole
fishing
only
a
short
distance
from
the
campsite
they
came
upon
the
unmistakable
marks
of
a
broad
paws
pressed
in
so
heavy
and
distinct
a
pattern
that
hume
knew
the
animal
could
not
be
far
ahead
the
indentations
were
deep
and
he
measured
the
distance
between
them
with
the
length
of
his
hand
big
one
chambriss
exclaimed
in
satisfaction
going
away
from
the
river
too
that
point
puzzled
hume
slightly
the
red
coated
felines
might
be
washed
out
of
their
burrows
but
they
did
not
willingly
head
so
sharply
away
from
the
water
he
squatted
on
his
heels
and
surveyed
the
stretch
of
countryside
between
them
and
the
distant
wood
with
care
the
grass
was
this
season
still
growing
not
tall
enough
to
afford
cover
for
an
animal
with
paws
as
large
as
these
prints
there
were
two
clumps
of
brush
it
could
have
holed
up
in
either
waiting
to
attack
any
trailer
but
why
it
had
not
been
wounded
nor
frightened
by
their
party
there
was
no
reason
for
it
to
set
an
ambush
on
its
back
trail
starns
and
yactisi
dropped
back
though
starns
was
fussing
with
his
rovald

up
he
had
drawn
his

in
answer
to
hume

foreign
to

to
be
mistrusted
getting
to
his
feet
hume
paced
along
the
line
of
marks
they
were
fresh
hot
fresh
and
they
still
led
in
a
straight
line
for
the
woods
with
another
wave
of
his
hand
he
stopped
chambriss
the
civ
was
trained
in
spite
of
his
eagerness
and
obeyed
hume
left
the
tracks
made
a
detour
which
brought
him
to
a
point
from
which
he
could
study
those
clumps
of
brush
no
sign
except
that
line
of
prints
pointed
to
the
woods
and
if
the
party
kept
on
they
might
well
come
upon
the
he
decided
to
risk
it
but
when
they
were
less
than
a
couple
of
yards
from
the
tree
fringe
his
hand
shot
up
to
direct
chambriss
to
fire
towards
the
quivering
bush
only
that
formless
half
seen
thing
hardly
to
be
distinguished
in
color
from
the
vegetation
was
no
there
was
a
thin
ragged
cry
then
the
creature
plunged
backward
was
gone
what
in
the
name
of
nine
gods
was
that
chambriss
demanded
i
do
know
hume
went
forward
jerked
the
needler

from
a

shoot

in

to

sweating
body
he
lay
on
a
wide
branch
trying
to
control
the
heavy
panting
which
supplied
his
laboring
lungs
and
he
could
still
hear
the
echoes
of
the
startled
cries
which
had
come
from
the
men
who
had
threaded
through
the
woods
to
the
tail

of
the
now
he
tried
to
reason
why
he
had
run
they
were
his
own
kind
they
would
take
him
out
of
the
loneliness
of
a
world
heretofore
empty
of
his
species
but
that

who
had
led
the
party
into

irregular

shivered
dug
his
nails
into
the
wood
on

he
lay
at
the
sight
of

and
reality
had
crashed
together
sending
him
into
flight
that
was
the
man
from
the
room
the
man
with
the
cup
as
his
heart
quieted
he
began
to
think
more
coherently
first
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
the
den
then
the
marks
on
the
ground
at
the
point
from
which
he
had
fallen
and
the
were
here
just
as
he
remembered
but
not
far
from
the
small
ship
he
had
discovered
something
more
a
campsite
with
a
shelter
fashioned
out
of
spalls
and
vines
containing
possessions
a
castaway
might
have
accumulated
that
man
would
come
rynch
was
sure
of
that
but
he
was
too
spent
to
struggle
on
no
the
answer
to
every
part
of
the
puzzle
lay
with
that
man
to
go
back
to
the
ship
clearing
was
to
risk
capture
but
he
had
to
know
rynch
looked
with
more
attention
at
his
present
surroundings
deep
mold
under
the
trees
here
would
hold
tracks
there
might
just
be
another
way
to
move
he
eyed
the
spread
of
limbs
on
a
neighbor
tree
his
journey
through
those
heights
was
awkward
and
he
sweated
and
cringed
when
he
disturbed
vocal
treetop
dwellers
he
was
also
to
discover
that
close
to
the
site
of
the
crash
others
waited
he
huddled
against
the
bole
of
a
tree
when
he
made
out
the
curve
of
a
round
bulk
holding
tight
to
the
tree
trunk
aloft
though
it
was
balled
in
upon
itself
he
was
sure
the
creature
was
fully
as
large
as
he
and
the
menacing
claws
suggested
it
was
a
formidable
opponent
when
it
made
no
move
to
follow
him
rynch
began
to
hope
it
had
only
been
defending
its
own
hiding
place
for
its
present
attitude
suggested
concealment
still
facing
that
featureless
blob
in
the
tree
the
man
retreated
alert
for
the
first
sign
of
advance
on
the
part
of
the
creature
above
none
came
and
he
dared
to
slip
around
the
bole
of
the
tree
under
which
he
stood
listening
intently
for
any
corresponding
movement
overhead
now
he
was
facing
that
survivor
camp
another
object
crouched
in
the
dark
of
the
shelter
just
as
its
fellow
was
on
sentry
duty
in
the
tree
only
this
one
did
not
have
the
of
the
foliage
to
disguise
it
its
long
forearms
curved
about
its
bent
knees
its
general
outline
almost
that
of
a
human
if
a
human
went
clothed
in
a
thick
fuzz
the
head
hunched
right
against
the
shoulders
as
if
the
neck
were
very
short
or
totally
lacking
was
with
the
longer
end
to
the
back
and
the
sense
organs
of
eyes
and
nose
squeezed
together
on
the
lower
quarter
of
the
rounded
portion
with
a
line
of
wide
mouth
to
split
the
blunt
round
of
the
muzzle
dark
pits
for
eyes
showed
no
pupil
iris
or
cornea
the
nose
was
a
black
perfectly
rounded
tube
jutting
an
inch
or
so
beyond
the
cheek
surface
grotesque
alien
and
terrifying
it
made
no
hostile
move
and
since
it
had
not
turned
its
head
he
could
not
be
sure
it
had
even
sighted
him
but
it
knew
he
was
there
he
was
certain
of
that
and
was
waiting
for
what
as
the
long
seconds
crawled
by
rynch
began
to
believe
that
it
was
not
waiting
for
him
heartened
he
pulled
at
the
vine
loop
climbed
back
into
the
tree
minutes
later
he
discovered
that
there
were
more
than
two
of
the
beasts
waiting
quietly
about
the
camp
and
that
their
sentry
line
ran
between
him
and
the
clearing
of
the
he
withdrew
farther
into
the
wood
intent
upon
finding
a
detour
which
would
bring
him
out
into
the
open
lands
now
he
wanted
to
join
forces
with
his
own
kind
whether
those
men
were
potential
enemies
or
not
as
time
passed
the
beasts
closed
about
the
clearing
of
the
camp
afternoon
was
fading
into
evening
when
he
reached
a
point
several
miles
downstream
near
the
river
since
he
had
come
into
the
open
he
had
not
sighted
any
of
the
watchers
he
hoped
they
did
not
willingly
venture
out
of
the
trees
where
the
leaves
were
their
protection
rynch
went
flat
on
the
stream
bank
made
a
worm
progress
up
the
slope
to
crouch
behind
a
bush
and
survey
the
land
immediately
ahead
there
stood
an
spacer
fins
down
nose
skyward
and
grouped
not
too
far
from
its
landing
ramp
a
collection
of
bubble
tents
a
fire
burned
in
their
midst
and
men
were
moving
about
it
now
that
he
was
free
from
the
wood
and
its
watchers
and
had
come
so
near
to
his
goal
rynch
was
curiously
reluctant
to
do
the
sensible
thing
to
rise
out
of
concealment
and
walk
up
to
that
fire
to
claim
rescue
by
his
own
kind
the
man
he
sought
stood
by
the
fire
shrugging
his
arms
into
a
webbing
harness
which
brought
a
box
against
his
chest
having
made
that
fast
he
picked
up
a
needler
by
its
sling
by
their
gestures
the
others
were
arguing
with
him
but
he
shook
his
head
came
on
to
be
a
shadow
stalking
among
other
shadows
one
of
the
men
trailed
him
but
as
they
reached
a
post
planted
a
little
beyond
the
bubble
tents
he
stopped
allowed
the
explorer
to
advance
alone
into
the
dark
rynch
went
to
cover
under
a
bush
the
man
was
heading
to
the
stream
bed
had
they
somehow
learned
of
his
own
presence
nearby
were
they
out
to
find
him
but
the
preparations
the
tall
man
had
made
seemed
more
suited
to
going
on
patrol
the
watchers
was
the
other
out
to
spy
on
them
that
idea
made
sense
and
in
the
meantime
he
would
let
the
other
past
him
follow
along
behind
until
he
was
far
enough
from
the
camp
so
that
his
friends
could
not
interfere
then
they
would
have
a
meeting
rynch
fingers
balled
into
fists
he
would
find
out
what
was
real
what
was
a
dream
in
this
crazy
mixed
up
mind
of
his
that
other
would
know
and
would
tell
him
the
truth
alert
as
he
was
he
lost
sight
of
the
stranger
who
melted
into
the
dusky
cover
of
the
shadows
then
came
a
quiet
ripple
of
water
close
to
his
own
hiding
place
the
man
from
the
spacer
camp
was
using
the
stream
as
his
road
in
spite
of
his
caution
rynch
was
close
to
betrayal
as
he
edged
around
a
clump
of
vegetation
growing
half
in
half
out
of
the
stream
only
a
timely
rustle
told
him
that
the
other
had
sat
down
on
a
drift
log
waiting
for
him
rynch
froze
so
startled
that
he
could
not
think
clearly
for
a
second
then
he
noted
that
the
outline
of
the
body
was
visible
growing
brighter
by
the
moment
minute
particles
of
radiance
were
gathering
about
the
other
the
dark
shadow
of
an
arm
flapped
the
radiance
swirled
broke
again
into
pinpoint
sparks
rynch
glanced
down
at
his
own
body
the
same
sparks
were
drifting
in
about
him
edging
his
arms
thighs
chest
he
pushed
back
into
the
bushes
while
the
sparks
still
flitted
but
they
no
longer
gathered
in
strength
enough
to
light
his
presence
now
he
could
see
they
drifted
about
the
vegetation
about
the
log
where
the
man
sat
about
rocks
and
reeds
only
they
were
thicker
about
the
stranger
as
if
his
body
were
a
magnet
he
continued
to
keep
them
whirling
by
means
of
waving
hand
and
arm
but
there
was
enough
light
to
show
rynch
the
fingers
of
his
other
hand
busy
on
the
front
panel
of
the
box
he
wore
that
fingering
stopped
then
rynch
head
came
up
as
he
heard
a
very
faint
sound
not
a
beast
cry
or
was
it
again
those
fingers
moved
on
the
panel
was
the
other
sending
a
message
by
that
means
rynch
watched
him
check
the
webbing
count
the
equipment
at
his
belt
settle
the
needler
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
then
the
stranger
left
the
stream
headed
towards
the
woods
rynch
jumped
to
his
feet
a
cry
of
warning
shaping
but
not
to
be
uttered
he
padded
after
the
other
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
stop
the
man
before
he
reached
the
danger
which
might
lurk
under
the
trees
however
the
other
was
as
wary
of
that
dark
as
if
he
suspected
what
might
lie
in
wait
there
he
angled
along
northward
avoiding
clumps
of
scattered
brush
keeping
in
the
open
where
rynch
dared
not
tail
him
too
closely
their
course
parallel
to
the
woods
brought
them
at
last
to
a
second
stream
the
size
of
a
river
into
which
the
first
creek
emptied
here
the
other
settled
down
between
two
rocks
with
every
indication
of
remaining
there
for
a
period
thankfully
rynch
found
his
own
lurking
place
from
which
he
could
keep
the
other
in
sight
the
light
points
gathered
hung
in
a
small
luminous
cloud
over
the
rocks
but
rynch
had
prudently
withdrawn
under
a
bush
and
the
scent
of
its
aromatic
leaves
must
have
discouraged
the
sparks
for
no
such
crown
came
to
his
sentry
post
drugged
with
fatigue
the
younger
man
slept
awaking
to
full
day
a
fog
of
bewilderment
and
disorientation
to
open
his
eyes
to
this
pocket
instead
of
to
four
dirty
walls
was
wrong
remembering
he
started
up
and
slunk
down
the
slope
angry
at
his
failure
he
found
the
other
track
not
turning
back
as
he
had
half
feared
cleanly
printed
on
level
spots
of
wet
earth
eastward
now
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
other
expedition
was
he
going
to
use
the
open
cut
through
which
the
river
ran
as
a
way
of
penetrating
the
wooded
country
now
rynch
considered
the
problem
from
his
own
angle
the
man
from
the
spacer
had
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
trail
in
fact
it
would
almost
seem
that
he
had
deliberately
gone
out
of
his
way
to
leave
boot
prints
on
favorable
stretches
of
ground
did
he
guess
that
rynch
lurked
behind
was
now
leading
him
on
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
or
were
those
traces
left
to
guide
another
party
from
the
camp
to
advance
openly
up
the
stream
bed
was
to
invite
discovery
rynch
surveyed
the
nearer
bank
clumps
of
small
trees
and
high
growing
bushes
dotted
that
expanse
an
ideal
cover
he
was
hardly
out
of
sight
of
the
bush
which
had
sheltered
him
when
he
heard
the
coughing
roar
of
a
and
the
feline
was
attacking
an
enemy
enraged
to
the
pitch
of
vocal
frenzy
rynch
ran
a
zigzag
course
from
one
clump
of
bush
to
the
next
that
sound
of
snarling
spitting
hate
ended
in
as
rynch
crawled
to
the
river
bank
the
man
from
the
spacer
camp
had
been
the
focus
of
a
attack
from
a
female
and
her
cubs
three
red
bodies
were
flat
and
still
on
the
gravel
as
the
leaned
back
against
a
rock
breathing
heavily
as
rynch
sighted
him
he
stooped
to
recover
the
needler
he
had
dropped
lurched
away
from
the
rock
towards
the
water
and
so
blundered
straight
into
another
jumalan
trap
his
unsteady
foot
advancing
for
another
step
came
down
on
a
slippery
surface
and
he
fell
forward
as
his
legs
were
engulfed
in
the
trap
burrow
of
a
with
a
startled
cry
the
man
dropped
the
needler
again
clawed
at
the
ground
about
him
already
he
was
buried
to
his
knees
then
his
in
the
artificial
quicksand
but
he
had
not
lost
his
head
and
was
jerking
from
side
to
side
in
an
effort
to
pull
free
rynch
got
to
his
feet
walked
with
slow
deliberation
down
to
the
river
brink
the
trapped
prisoner
had
shied
halfway
around
stretching
out
his
arms
to
find
a
firmer
grip
on
some
rock
large
and
heavy
enough
to
anchor
him
after
his
first
startled
cry
he
had
made
no
sound
but
now
as
he
sighted
rynch
his
eyes
widened
and
his
lips
parted
the
box
on
his
chest
caught
on
a
stone
he
had
dragged
to
him
in
a
desperate
try
for
support
there
was
a
spitting
of
sparks
and
the
stranger
worked
frantically
at
the
buckle
of
the
webbing
harness
to
loosen
it
and
toss
the
whole
thing
from
him
the
box
struck
one
of
the
dead
flashed
as
fur
and
flesh
were
singed
rynch
watched
dispassionately
before
he
caught
the
needler
jerking
it
away
from
the
prisoner
the
man
eyed
him
steadily
and
his
expression
did
not
alter
even
when
rynch
swung
the
weapon
to
center
its
sights
on
the
late
owner
suppose
rynch
voice
was
rusty
sounding
in
his
own
ears
we
talk
now
the
man
nodded
as
you
wish
brodie
brodie
rynch
squatted
on
his
heels
those
gray
eyes
so
light
in
the
other
deeply
tanned
face
narrowed
the
smallest
fraction
rynch
noted
with
an
inner
surge
of
triumph
were
you
looking
for
me
he
added
yes
why
we
found
an
we
wondered
if
there
were
survivors
slowly
rynch
shook
his
head
no
you
knew
i
was
here
because
you
brought
me
he
fashioned
his
suspicions
into
one
quick
thrust
this
time
there
was
not
the
slightest
hint
of
from
the
other
you
see
rynch
leaned
forward
but
still
well
out
of
reach
from
the
captive
i
remember
now
there
was
a
faint
flicker
of
answer
in
the
man
eyes
he
asked
quietly
what
do
you
remember
brodie
enough
to
know
that
i
am
not
brodie
that
i
did
not
get
here
on
the
did
not
build
that
camp
he
ran
one
hand
over
the
stock
of
the
needler
whatever
motive
lay
behind
this
weird
game
into
which
he
had
been
unwillingly
introduced
he
was
now
sure
that
it
was
serious
enough
to
be
dangerous
you
have
no
cup
this
time
so
you
do
remember
the
other
accepted
that
calmly
all
right
that
need
not
necessarily
spoil
our
plans
you
have
nothing
to
return
to
on
nahuatl
unless
you
the
starfall
his
voice
was
icy
with
contempt
to
play
our
roles
will
be
for
your
advantage
too
he
paused
his
gaze
centering
on
rynch
with
the
intensity
of
one
willing
the
desired
answer
out
of
his
inferior
nahuatl
rynch
caught
at
that
he
had
been
on
or
in
nahuatl
a
planet
a
city
if
he
could
make
this
man
believe
he
remembered
everything
clearly
more
than
just
the
scattered
patches
that
he
did
you
had
me
planted
here
then
came
back
to
hunt
me
why
what
makes
rynch
brodie
so
important
close
to
a
billion
credits
the
man
from
the
spacer
leaned
well
back
in
the
hole
his
arms
spread
flat
out
on
either
side
to
keep
his
body
from
sinking
deeper
a
billion
credits
he
repeated
softly
rynch
laughed
you
have
to
think
of
a
better
one
than
that
the
stakes
would
have
to
be
high
would
they
for
us
to
go
to
all
this
staging
you
been
conditioned
brodie
illegally
to
rynch
the
words
meant
nothing
if
they
ever
had
that
was
gone
lost
in
the
maze
of
other
things
which
had
been
blotted
out
of
his
mind
by
the
brodie
past
but
he
would
not
give
the
other
the
advantage
of
knowing
his
uncertainty
you
need
a
brodie
for
a
billion
credits
but
you
do
have
a
brodie
now
to
his
surprise
the
prisoner
in
the
earth
trap
laughed
i
have
a
brodie
when
he
needed
think
about
a
good
share
of
a
billion
credits
boy
keep
thinking
of
that
hard
i
will
thoughts
alone
wo
work
it
you
know
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
hint
of
some
emotion
in
the
man
voice
you
mean
i
need
you
i
do
think
so
i
stopped
being
a
plaque
for
someone
to
play
across
the
board
that
expression
brought
another
momentary
flash
of
hazy
memory
a
smoky
crowded
room
where
men
slid
counters
back
and
forth
across
tables
not
one
of
brodie
edited
recalls
but
his
own
rynch
stood
up
started
for
the
rise
of
the
slope
but
before
he
topped
that
he
glanced
back
the
damaged
com
box
still
smoked
where
its
wearer
had
flung
it
now
the
man
was
already
straining
forward
with
both
arms
trying
to
reach
a
rock
just
a
finger
space
beyond
lucky
for
him
the
burrow
was
an
old
one
uninhabited
in
time
he
should
be
able
to
work
his
way
out
meanwhile
there
was
the
whole
of
a
wide
countryside
in
which
rynch
could
discover
a
hideout
no
one
would
find
him
now
against
his
will
he
tried
as
he
strode
along
to
piece
together
more
of
his
memories
and
the
scanty
information
he
had
had
from
the
nahuatl
man
so
he
had
been
given
a
set
of
false
memories
to
fit
a
rynch
brodie
whose
presence
on
this
world
meant
a
billion
credits
for
someone
he
could
not
believe
that
this
was
the
spaceman
game
alone
for
had
he
spoken
of
we
a
billion
credits
the
sum
was
fantastic
the
whole
story
unbelievable
there
was
a
hot
stab
of
pain
on
his
instep
rynch
cried
out
stamped
hard
one
of
the
clawed
scavengers
was
crushed
the
man
leaped
back
in
time
to
avoid
another
step
into
a
swarming
mass
of
them
at
work
on
some
unidentifiable
carrion
staring
down
at
the
welter
of
scaled
segmented
bodies
and
busy
claws
he
gasped
three
dead
were
near
the
man
trapped
in
the
pit
bait
to
draw
these
voracious
eaters
straight
to
the
prisoner
rynch
empty
stomach
heaved
he
swung
around
ran
across
the
grassy
verge
of
the
upper
bank
hoping
he
was
not
too
late
as
he
half
fell
half
slid
down
to
the
water
he
saw
that
the
man
had
managed
to
hook
the
webbing
of
the
smouldering
box
to
him
was
casting
it
out
and
dragging
it
back
patiently
aiming
at
the
nearest
rock
of
size
fruitlessly
attempting
to
hitch
its
straps
over
the
round
of
stone
rynch
dashed
on
caught
at
that
loop
of
webbing
and
dug
his
heels
into
the
loose
gravel
as
he
began
a
steady
pull
with
his
aid
the
other
crawled
out
lay
panting
rynch
grabbed
the
man
shoulder
jerked
him
away
from
the
body
of
the
female
he
was
sure
he
had
seen
a
telltale
scurrying
around
the
smaller
of
the
dead
cubs
the
man
straightened
glanced
toward
rynch
who
was
backing
off
the
needler
up
and
ready
between
them
my
turn
to
ask
why
then
his
gaze
followed
rynch
the
smallest
cub
twitched
from
side
to
side
not
with
any
faint
trace
of
life
but
under
the
attack
of
the
scavengers
more
scuttled
towards
the
second
cub
thanks
the
stranger
was
on
his
feet
my
name
is
ras
hume
i
think
i
told
you
that
when
we
last
met
this
does
make
any
difference
i
not
your
man
not
brodie
hume
shrugged
you
think
about
it
brodie
think
about
it
with
care
come
back
to
camp
with
me
and
no
rynch
interrupted
you
go
your
way
i
go
mine
from
here
on
again
the
other
laughed
not
so
simple
as
all
that
boy
started
something
which
ca
just
be
turned
off
as
easily
as
you
snap
down
a
switch
he
took
a
step
or
two
in
rynch
direction
the
younger
man
brought
up
the
needler
stay
right
where
you
are
your
game
hume
all
right
you
play
it
but
not
with
me
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
take
to
the
woods
what
i
do
is
my
business
hume
no
my
business
too
very
much
so
i
giving
you
a
warning
boy
in
return
for
your
help
here
he
nodded
at
the
pit
there
something
in
that
woods
something
which
did
show
up
when
the
guild
had
their
survey
exploration
here
the
watchers
rynch
retreated
step
by
step
keeping
the
needler
ready
i
saw
them
you
seen
them
hume
was
eager
what
do
they
look
like
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
be
rid
of
hume
rynch
found
himself
answering
that
in
detail
discovering
that
on
demand
he
could
recall
minutely
the
description
of
the
animal
hiding
in
the
tree
the
one
who
had
waited
in
the
shelter
and
those
he
had
glimpsed
drawing
in
about
the
clearing
no
intelligence
hume
turned
his
head
to
survey
the
distant
wood
the
verifier
reported
no
intelligence
these
watchers
you
do
know
them
no
nor
do
i
like
what
you
seen
of
them
brodie
so
i
willing
to
call
a
truce
the
guild
believed
jumala
an
open
planet
our
records
accredited
it
so
if
that
is
not
true
we
may
be
in
for
bad
trouble
as
an
i
am
responsible
for
the
safety
of
three
civs
back
there
in
the
safari
camp
hume
made
sense
much
as
rynch
disliked
admitting
it
and
the
hunter
must
have
read
something
of
his
agreement
in
his
face
for
now
he
nodded
and
added
briskly
best
place
now
is
the
safari
camp
we
head
back
at
once
only
time
had
run
out
a
noise
sounded
with
a
metallic
ring
rynch
whirled
needler
cocked
a
glittering
ball
about
the
size
of
his
fist
rolled
away
from
contact
with
a
boulder
came
to
rest
in
the
deep
depression
of
one
of
hume
boot
tracks
then
another
flash
through
the
air
a
clatter
as
a
second
ball
spun
across
a
patch
of
gravel
the
balls
seemed
to
appear
out
of
the
air
displaying
rainbow
glints
they
rolled
in
a
semicircle
about
the
two
men
rynch
stooped
then
hume
fingers
latched
about
his
wrist
dragging
his
hand
away
from
the
globe
it
was
only
then
that
he
realized
that
sharp
action
had
detached
his
attention
from
that
ball
he
had
wanted
to
take
up
do
touch
hume
barked
and
do
look
at
that
too
closely
come
along
he
pulled
rynch
forward
through
the
yet
unclosed
arc
of
the
globe
circle
hume
detoured
around
the
feasting
scavengers
and
brought
rynch
with
him
at
a
trot
they
could
hear
behind
them
the
plop
and
tinkle
of
more
globes
glancing
back
rynch
saw
one
fall
close
to
the
bodies
of
the
wait
a
minute
he
pulled
back
against
hume
hold
here
was
a
chance
to
see
what
effect
that
crystal
had
on
the
clawed
carrion
eater
there
was
a
change
in
the
crystal
yellow
now
then
red
red
as
the
few
scraps
of
fur
remaining
on
the
rapidly
disappearing
body
look
the
pulsating
carpet
which
had
covered
the
dead
feline
ceased
to
move
but
towards
that
spot
rolled
two
more
of
the
globes
approaching
the
scavengers
now
the
clawed
things
were
stirring
dropping
away
from
their
prey
they
spread
out
in
a
patch
moved
purposefully
forward
behind
them
as
guardians
might
head
a
flock
rolled
three
globes
flushing
scarlet
then
more
hume
hand
came
up
from
the
cone
tip
of
the
ray
tube
spat
a
lance
of
fire
to
strike
the
middle
crystal
the
beam
was
reflected
into
the
block
of
scavengers
scaled
bodies
twisted
crisped
were
ash
but
the
crystal
continued
to
roll
at
the
same
pace
move
hume
other
hand
hit
rynch
shoulder
knocked
him
forward
in
an
impetuous
shove
which
nearly
took
him
off
his
feet
both
men
began
to
run
what
what
are
those
things
rynch
appealed
between
panting
breaths
i
do
know
and
i
do
like
their
looks
they
between
us
and
the
safari
camp
if
we
keep
to
the
river
between
us
and
the
river
now
rynch
saw
that
glittering
swoop
through
the
air
marked
the
landing
of
a
ball
near
the
water
edge
might
be
trying
to
box
us
in
but
that
not
going
to
work
see
ahead
there
where
that
log
caught
between
two
rocks
run
out
on
that
when
we
reach
there
and
take
to
the
water
i
do
think
those
things
can
float
and
if
they
sink
to
the
bottom
that
ought
to
fix
them
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
rynch
ran
still
holding
the
needler
he
balanced
along
the
drift
log
hume
had
pointed
out
and
a
jump
sent
him
floundering
in
the
brown
stream
thigh
deep
hume
joined
him
his
face
grim
downstream
rynch
looked
one
shape
two
three
clearly
detailed
where
matching
vegetation
gave
them
no
covering
camouflage
the
watchers
had
come
out
of
the
woods
at
last
a
line
of
them
were
walking
quietly
and
upright
towards
the
humans
their
fuzz
covering
like
a
mist
under
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
quiet
as
they
seemed
at
present
the
things
out
of
the
jumalan
forest
were
a
picture
of
sheer
brute
strength
as
they
moved
let
get
out
of
here
fast
the
men
kept
moving
and
always
after
them
padded
that
silent
line
of
pushing
them
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
safari
camp
on
towards
the
rising
mountain
peaks
just
as
the
globes
had
shaken
the
scavengers
loose
from
their
meal
and
sent
them
marching
on
so
were
the
humans
being
herded
for
some
unknown
purpose
at
least
once
the
march
of
the
beasts
began
they
saw
and
heard
no
more
of
the
globes
and
as
they
reached
a
curve
in
the
river
hume
stopped
swung
around
stood
studying
the
line
of
decorously
pacing
animals
we
can
pick
them
off
with
the
needler
or
the
ray
the
hunter
shook
his
head
you
do
kill
he
recited
the
credo
of
his
guild
not
until
you
are
sure
there
is
a
method
behind
this
and
method
means
intelligence
handling
of
creatures
and
peoples
was
a
part
of
guild
training
in
spite
of
his
devious
game
here
on
jumala
hume
was
guild
educated
and
rynch
was
willing
to
leave
such
decisions
to
him
the
other
held
out
the
ray
tube
take
this
cover
me
but
do
use
it
until
i
say
so
understand
he
waited
only
for
rynch
nod
before
he
started
at
a
deliberate
pace
which
matched
that
of
the
beasts
back
through
the
river
shallows
to
meet
them
but
that
advancing
line
halted
stood
waiting
in
silence
hume
hands
went
up
palm
out
he
spoke
slowly
in
clicks
friend
this
was
all
rynch
could
make
out
of
that
of
syllables
rynch
knew
to
be
a
contact
pattern
the
dark
eye
pits
continued
to
stare
a
light
breeze
ruffled
the
fuzz
covering
of
wide
shoulders
long
muscular
arms
not
a
head
moved
not
one
of
those
heavy
rounded
jaws
opened
to
emit
any
answering
sound
hume
halted
the
silence
was
threatening
a
portending
atmosphere
spread
from
the
alien
things
as
might
a
tangible
wave
for
perhaps
two
breaths
they
stood
so
man
facing
alien
then
hume
turned
walked
back
his
face
set
rynch
offered
him
the
ray
tube
fight
our
way
out
too
late
look
moving
lines
of
coming
down
to
the
river
not
five
or
six
now
a
dozen
twenty
there
was
a
small
trickle
of
moisture
down
the
side
of
the
hunter
brown
face
we
penned
except
straight
ahead
but
we
going
to
fight
rynch
protested
no
move
on
it
was
some
time
before
hume
found
what
he
wanted
an
islet
in
midstream
lacking
any
growth
and
rising
to
a
rough
pinnacle
the
sides
were
seamed
with
crevices
and
caves
which
promised
protection
for
one
back
in
any
desperate
struggle
and
they
had
discovered
it
none
too
soon
for
the
late
afternoon
shadows
were
lengthening
there
had
been
no
attack
just
the
trailing
to
herd
the
men
to
the
northeast
and
rynch
had
lost
the
first
tight
pinch
of
panic
though
he
knew
the
folly
of
underestimating
the
unknown
they
climbed
with
unspoken
consent
going
clear
to
the
top
where
they
huddled
together
on
a
tableland
hume
unhooked
his
distance
lenses
but
it
was
toward
the
rises
of
the
mountains
that
he
aimed
them
not
along
the
back
trail
rynch
wriggled
about
studied
the
river
and
its
banks
the
beasts
there
were
quiet
lumps
standing
down
on
the
river
bank
or
squatting
in
the
grass
nothing
hume
lowered
the
lenses
held
them
before
his
broad
chest
as
he
still
watched
the
peaks
what
did
you
expect
rynch
snapped
he
was
hungry
but
not
hungry
enough
to
abandon
the
islet
hume
laughed
shortly
i
do
know
only
i
sure
they
are
heading
us
in
that
direction
look
here
rynch
rounded
on
him
you
know
this
planet
you
been
here
before
i
was
one
of
the
survey
team
that
approved
it
for
the
guild
then
you
must
have
combed
it
pretty
thoroughly
how
is
it
that
you
did
know
about
them
he
gestured
to
their
pursuers
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
ask
a
few
assorted
experts
right
about
now
hume
returned
the
verifiers
registered
no
intelligent
native
life
here
no
native
life
rynch
chewed
that
over
came
up
with
the
obvious
explanation
all
right
so
then
maybe
our
friends
are
imported
suppose
someone
running
a
private
business
of
his
own
here
and
wants
to
get
rid
of
visitors
hume
looked
thoughtful
no
he
did
not
enlarge
upon
his
negative
sitting
down
he
pulled
a
cylinder
container
from
a
belt
loop
and
shook
out
four
tablets
handing
two
to
rynch
mouthing
the
others
good
for
hours
sustenance
the
iron
rations
depended
upon
by
all
exploring
services
did
not
have
the
satisfying
taste
of
real
food
however
rynch
swallowed
them
dutifully
before
he
descended
with
hume
to
river
level
the
hunter
splashed
water
from
the
stream
into
a
depression
in
the
rock
and
dropped
a
pinch
of
clarifying
powder
into
it
with
the
dark
he
announced
we
might
be
able
to
get
through
their
lines
you
believe
that
hume
laughed
no
but
one
does
overlook
the
factor
of
sheer
luck
also
i
do
care
to
finish
up
at
the
place
they
may
have
chosen
for
us
he
tilted
his
chin
to
study
the
sky
we
take
watches
and
rest
in
turn
no
use
trying
anything
until
it
is
dark
unless
they
start
to
move
in
you
take
the
first
one
as
rynch
nodded
hume
edged
back
into
a
crevice
as
a
shelled
creature
withdrawing
to
natural
protection
going
to
sleep
as
easily
as
if
he
could
control
that
state
by
will
rynch
watching
him
curiously
for
a
second
or
two
before
climbing
up
to
a
position
from
which
he
judged
he
could
see
all
sides
of
their
refuge
determined
not
to
be
surprised
the
watchers
were
crouched
down
waiting
with
that
patience
which
had
impressed
him
from
his
first
sight
of
the
camp
sentries
back
in
the
forest
there
was
no
movement
no
sound
they
were
simply
there
on
guard
and
rynch
did
not
believe
that
the
darkness
of
night
would
bring
any
relaxation
of
that
vigilance
he
leaned
back
feeling
the
grit
of
the
rocky
surface
against
his
bare
back
and
shoulders
under
his
hand
was
the
most
efficient
and
formidable
weapon
known
to
the
frontier
worlds
from
this
post
he
could
keep
the
enemy
under
surveillance
and
think
hume
had
had
him
planted
here
in
the
first
place
provided
with
the
memory
of
rynch
brodie
the
reward
for
him
was
to
be
a
billion
credits
too
much
staff
work
had
gone
into
his
conditioning
for
just
a
small
stake
so
rynch
brodie
was
on
jumala
and
hume
had
come
with
witnesses
to
find
him
another
part
of
his
mind
stood
aloof
now
applauding
the
clearness
of
his
reasoning
rynch
brodie
was
to
be
discovered
a
castaway
on
jumala
only
matters
had
not
worked
out
according
to
hume
plan
in
the
first
place
he
was
certain
he
had
not
been
intended
to
know
that
he
was
not
rynch
brodie
for
a
fleeting
second
he
wondered
why
that
conditioning
had
not
completely
worked
then
went
back
to
the
problem
of
his
relationship
with
hume
no
the
had
expected
a
castaway
who
would
be
just
what
he
ordered
then
this
affair
of
the
watchers
creatures
the
guild
men
had
not
found
here
a
few
months
ago
rynch
felt
a
small
cold
chill
along
his
spine
hume
game
was
one
thing
something
he
could
understand
but
the
silent
beasts
were
another
and
somehow
far
more
disturbing
threat
rynch
edged
forward
watching
the
mist
on
the
water
his
brain
striving
to
solve
this
other
puzzle
as
neatly
as
he
thought
he
had
discovered
the
reason
for
his
scrambled
memories
and
his
being
on
jumala
the
mist
was
an
added
danger
thick
enough
and
those
watchers
could
move
in
under
its
curtain
a
needler
was
efficient
yes
but
it
could
wipe
out
only
an
enemy
at
which
it
was
aimed
blind
cross
sweeping
with
its
darts
would
only
exhaust
the
clip
without
results
save
by
lucky
chance
on
the
other
hand
suppose
they
could
turn
that
same
gray
haze
to
their
own
advantage
use
it
to
blanket
their
withdrawal
he
was
about
to
go
to
hume
with
that
suggestion
when
he
sighted
the
new
move
in
their
odd
battle
with
the
aliens
a
wink
of
light
two
more
blinking
following
the
erratic
course
by
the
pull
of
the
stream
all
bobbing
along
toward
the
rugged
coastline
of
the
islet
those
had
appeared
out
of
nothingness
as
suddenly
as
the
globes
when
this
chase
had
begun
the
globes
and
the
winking
lights
on
the
water
connected
in
his
mind
argued
new
danger
rynch
took
careful
aim
fired
a
dart
at
one
which
had
grounded
on
the
pointed
tip
of
the
rocks
where
the
river
current
came
together
after
its
division
about
the
island
for
the
first
time
rynch
realized
those
things
below
were
moving
the
current
they
had
come
upstream
as
if
propelled
he
had
fired
and
the
light
was
still
there
two
more
coming
in
behind
it
so
that
now
there
was
an
irregular
cluster
of
them
and
there
was
activity
on
the
rocks
before
them
just
as
the
scavengers
had
moved
ahead
of
the
globes
on
land
so
now
aquatic
creatures
had
come
out
of
the
river
were
flopping
higher
on
the
islet
and
those
lights
were
changing
color
from
white
to
rynch
scrabbled
with
one
hand
in
a
rock
crevice
found
a
stone
he
had
noted
earlier
he
hurled
that
at
the
cluster
of
lights
there
was
a
puff
of
brilliant
red
one
was
gone
something
flopping
on
the
rocks
gave
a
mewling
cry
and
somersaulted
back
into
the
water
then
a
finger
of
mist
drew
between
rynch
and
the
lights
which
were
now
only
faint
glowing
patches
he
swung
down
from
his
perch
shook
hume
awake
the
made
that
instant
return
to
full
consciousness
which
was
another
defense
for
the
men
who
live
long
on
the
rim
of
wild
worlds
what
rynch
pulled
him
forward
the
mist
had
thickened
but
there
were
more
of
those
ominous
lights
at
water
level
spreading
down
both
sides
of
the
point
forming
a
wall
dark
forms
moved
out
of
the
water
ahead
of
them
flopping
on
the
rocks
pressing
higher
towards
the
ledge
where
the
men
stood
those
globes
i
think
they
moving
in
the
river
now
rynch
found
another
stone
took
careful
aim
and
smashed
a
second
one
the
needler
has
no
effect
on
them
he
reported
stones
do
but
i
know
why
they
searched
about
them
in
the
crevices
for
more
ammunition
laying
up
a
line
of
rocks
while
the
lights
gathered
in
spreading
farther
and
farther
down
the
shores
of
the
islet
hume
cried
out
suddenly
and
aimed
his
ray
tube
below
the
lance
of
its
blast
cut
the
dark
as
might
a
bolt
of
lightning
with
a
shrill
squeal
a
blot
shadow
detached
from
the
slope
immediately
below
them
a
vile
musky
scent
now
mingled
with
the
stench
of
burning
flesh
set
them
coughing
water
spider
hume
identified
if
they
are
driving
those
out
and
up
at
he
fumbled
at
his
equipment
belt
and
then
tossed
an
object
downward
to
disintegrate
in
a
shower
of
fiery
sparks
wherever
those
sparks
touched
rock
or
ground
they
flared
up
in
tall
thin
columns
of
fire
lighting
up
the
nightmare
on
the
rocks
and
up
the
ledges
rynch
fired
the
needler
hume
ray
tube
flashed
and
flashed
again
things
squealed
or
grunted
or
died
silently
while
clawing
to
reach
the
upper
ledges
he
could
not
be
sure
of
the
nature
of
some
of
those
things
one
armed
and
clawed
as
the
scavengers
was
nearly
as
large
as
a
and
a
furry
creature
with
a
head
bore
also
a
ring
of
phosphorescent
eyes
set
in
a
complete
circle
about
its
skull
they
were
alien
life
routed
out
of
the
water
the
lights
smash
the
lights
hume
ordered
rynch
understood
the
lights
had
driven
these
attackers
out
of
the
river
put
out
the
lights
and
the
boiling
broth
of
water
dwellers
might
conceivably
return
to
their
homes
he
dropped
the
needler
took
up
stones
and
set
about
the
business
of
finishing
off
as
many
of
the
lights
as
he
could
hume
fired
into
the
crawling
mass
pausing
only
once
to
send
another
of
those
flame
bombs
crashing
to
illuminate
the
scene
the
water
creatures
bewildered
clumsy
out
of
their
element
were
so
far
at
his
mercy
but
their
numbers
in
spite
of
the
piling
dead
were
still
a
dangerous
threat
rynch
tore
gapping
holes
in
that
line
of
lights
but
he
could
see
through
the
mist
more
floating
sparks
gathering
to
take
their
places
perhaps
herding
before
them
more
water
things
to
attack
except
for
those
few
gaps
he
had
wrought
the
islet
was
now
completely
enveloped
ahhhh
hume
voice
arose
in
a
roar
of
anger
and
defiance
he
stabbed
his
ray
down
at
a
spot
just
below
their
ledge
a
huge
segmented
taloned
leg
kicked
caught
on
the
edge
of
the
stone
at
the
level
of
their
feet
twisted
aloft
again
and
was
gone
up
hume
ordered
to
the
top
rynch
caught
up
two
handsful
of
stones
holding
them
to
his
chest
with
his
left
arm
as
he
made
a
last
cast
to
see
one
light
puff
out
in
answer
then
they
both
scrambled
on
to
that
small
platform
at
the
top
of
the
islet
by
the
aid
of
the
burning
the
hunter
had
set
they
could
see
that
most
of
the
rocky
slopes
below
them
now
squirmed
with
a
horrible
mass
of
water
life
where
hume
had
fired
his
ray
there
was
fierce
activity
as
the
living
feasted
on
the
slain
and
quarreled
over
the
bounty
but
from
other
quarters
the
crawling
advance
pressed
on
i
have
only
one
more
flame
flare
hume
stated
one
more
flare
then
they
would
be
in
the
dark
with
the
mist
hiding
the
enemy
i
wonder
if
they
are
watching
out
there
rynch
scowled
into
the
dark
they
or
what
sent
them
they
know
what
they
are
doing
you
mean
they
must
have
done
this
before
i
think
so
that
back
there
it
made
a
good
landing
and
there
are
supplies
missing
from
its
lockers
which
you
removed
rynch
countered
no
there
might
have
been
real
castaways
landed
here
not
that
we
found
any
trace
of
them
now
i
can
guess
why
but
you
guild
men
were
here
and
you
did
run
into
this
i
know
hume
sounded
baffled
not
a
sign
then
rynch
threw
the
last
of
his
stones
heard
it
clink
harmlessly
against
a
rock
hume
balanced
an
object
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
last
flare
what
that
over
there
rynch
had
sighted
the
flashing
out
of
the
dark
from
the
river
bank
making
a
pattern
of
flickers
which
bore
no
relation
to
the
infernal
lights
at
the
water
edge
hume
ray
tube
pointed
skyward
as
he
answered
with
a
series
of
short
bursts
take
cover
the
call
came
weirdly
out
over
the
water
the
tone
dehumanized
hume
cupped
his
mouth
with
one
hand
shouted
back
we
on
top
no
cover
then
flatten
down
we
blasting
they
flattened
lay
almost
in
each
other
arms
curled
on
that
narrow
space
even
through
his
closed
eyelids
rynch
caught
the
flash
of
vivid
lightning
crashing
first
on
one
side
of
the
islet
and
then
on
the
other
and
sweeping
every
crawling
horror
out
of
life
into
odorous
ash
the
backlash
of
that
blast
must
have
caught
the
majority
of
the
lights
also
for
when
rynch
and
hume
cautiously
sat
up
they
saw
only
a
handful
of
widely
scattered
and
dulling
globes
below
they
choked
coughed
rubbed
watering
eyes
as
the
fumes
from
the
scorched
rocks
wreathed
up
about
their
perch
flitter
with
life
line
above
you
that
voice
had
come
out
of
what
should
have
been
empty
air
over
their
heads
a
gangling
line
trailed
across
their
bodies
a
line
with
a
safety
belt
locked
to
it
and
a
second
was
uncoiling
in
a
slow
loop
as
they
watched
in
unison
they
grabbed
for
those
means
of
escape
buckled
the
belts
about
them
haul
away
hume
called
the
lines
tightened
their
bodies
swung
up
clear
of
the
blasted
river
island
as
their
unseen
transport
headed
for
the
eastern
shore
a
subdued
but
steady
light
all
around
him
issued
from
stark
gray
walls
he
lay
on
his
back
in
an
empty
and
he
better
be
on
the
move
before
darfu
comes
to
enforce
a
rising
order
with
a
powerful
kick
or
one
of
these
backhanded
blows
which
the
salarkian
used
to
reduce
most
humans
to
helpless
obedience
vye
blinked
again
but
this
was
his
cubby
hole
at
the
starfall
his
nose
as
well
as
his
eyes
told
him
that
there
was
no
hint
of
uncleanliness
or
corruption
here
he
sat
up
stiffly
looked
down
at
his
own
body
in
dull
wonder
the
only
covering
on
his
bare
brown
self
was
a
wide
scaled
belt
and
a
loin
cloth
clumsy
sandals
shod
his
feet
and
his
legs
up
to
thigh
level
were
striped
with
healing
scratches
and
blotched
with
bruises
painfully
with
mental
processes
as
stiff
as
his
arms
and
his
legs
he
tried
to
think
back
sluggishly
memory
associated
one
picture
with
another
last
night
or
yesterday
rynch
brodie
had
been
locked
in
here
and
here
was
one
of
the
storage
compartments
of
a
spacer
belonging
to
a
man
named
wass
it
had
been
wass
pilot
in
the
flitter
which
snaked
them
from
the
river
islet
where
the
monsters
had
besieged
them
this
was
a
concealed
fortified
camp
wass
hideout
and
he
was
a
prisoner
with
a
very
uncertain
future
depending
upon
the
will
of
the
veep
and
a
man
named
hume
hume
the
had
shown
no
surprise
when
wass
stood
up
in
the
lamplight
to
greet
the
rescued
i
see
you
have
been
hunting
his
eyes
had
moved
from
hume
to
rynch
and
back
again
yes
but
that
does
not
matter
the
hunter
had
returned
impatiently
no
then
what
does
this
is
not
a
free
world
i
have
to
report
that
get
my
civs
off
planet
before
something
happens
to
them
i
thought
all
safari
worlds
were
certified
as
free
wass
countered
this
one
is
i
do
know
how
or
why
but
that
fact
has
to
be
reported
and
the
civs
lifted
not
so
fast
wass
voice
had
been
quiet
almost
gentle
such
a
report
would
interest
the
patrol
would
it
not
of
course
hume
began
and
then
stopped
abruptly
wass
smiled
you
see
complications
already
i
do
not
wish
to
explain
anything
to
the
patrol
nor
do
you
either
my
young
friend
not
when
you
stop
to
think
about
what
might
result
from
such
explanations
there
would
have
been
any
trouble
if
you
kept
away
from
jumala
hume
control
had
returned
both
voice
and
manner
were
under
tight
rein
were
rovald
reports
explicit
enough
to
satisfy
you
i
have
risked
a
great
deal
on
this
project
wass
replied
also
it
is
well
from
time
to
time
for
a
veep
to
check
upon
his
field
operatives
men
do
not
grow
careless
when
personal
supervision
is
ever
in
mind
and
it
is
well
that
i
did
arrive
here
is
it
not
hunter
or
would
you
have
preferred
remaining
on
that
island
whether
any
of
our
project
may
be
salvaged
is
a
point
we
must
consider
but
for
the
moment
we
make
no
moves
no
hume
your
civs
will
have
to
take
their
chances
for
a
time
and
if
there
is
trouble
hume
challenged
him
a
report
of
an
alien
attack
will
bring
in
the
patrol
quickly
enough
you
forget
rovald
wass
corrected
the
chance
that
one
of
your
civs
can
activate
and
transmit
from
the
spacer
is
remote
and
rovald
will
see
that
it
is
impossible
you
have
picked
up
brodie
i
see
yes
no
what
had
possessed
him
at
that
moment
to
contradict
he
had
realized
the
folly
of
his
outburst
the
moment
wass
had
looked
at
him
this
becomes
more
interesting
the
veep
had
remarked
with
that
deceptive
gentleness
you
are
rynch
brodie
castaway
from
the
largo
drift
are
you
not
i
trust
that
hume
has
made
plain
to
you
our
concern
with
your
welfare
gentlehomo
brodie
i
not
brodie
having
taken
the
leap
into
the
dangerous
truth
he
was
stubborn
enough
to
continue
swimming
i
find
this
enlightening
indeed
if
you
are
not
brodie
then
who
are
you
that
had
been
it
at
that
moment
he
could
have
told
wass
who
he
was
explain
that
his
patchwork
of
memories
had
gaping
holes
and
you
wass
reptilian
regard
had
moved
again
to
hume
perhaps
you
have
an
adequate
explanation
for
this
discovery
none
of
his
doing
he
burst
out
i
remembered
some
inexplicable
emotion
made
rynch
defend
hume
then
hume
laughed
and
there
was
a
reckless
edge
to
that
sound
yes
wass
your
techs
are
not
as
good
as
they
pretend
to
be
he
did
follow
the
pattern
of
action
they
set
for
him
a
pity
but
there
are
always
errors
when
one
deals
with
the
human
factor
peake
one
of
the
other
three
men
moved
towards
them
you
will
escort
this
young
man
to
the
spacer
see
him
safely
stowed
for
the
present
yes
a
pity
now
we
must
see
just
how
much
can
be
salvaged
then
vye
had
been
brought
into
the
shop
supplied
with
a
ration
container
and
left
to
himself
within
this
cabin
to
meditate
upon
the
folly
of
talking
too
freely
why
had
he
been
so
utterly
stupid
veeps
of
wass
calibre
did
not
swim
through
the
murky
channels
of
the
starfall
but
their
general
breed
had
smaller
but
just
as
vicious
representatives
there
and
he
knew
the
man
for
what
he
was
ruthless
powerful
and
thorough
a
sound
slight
but
easily
heard
in
the
silent
vacuum
of
the
storage
cabin
alerted
him
the
crack
of
the
sliding
panel
door
opened
and
vye
crouched
his
hand
cupping
the
only
possible
weapon
the
ration
container
hume
edged
through
shut
the
door
behind
him
he
stood
there
his
head
turned
so
his
ear
rested
against
the
wall
obviously
he
was
listening
you
idiot
the
hunter
voice
was
a
thread
of
whisper
why
could
you
have
kept
that
swinging
jaw
of
yours
closed
last
night
now
listen
and
listen
good
this
is
a
slim
try
but
one
we
have
to
take
we
vye
was
startled
into
asking
yes
we
by
rights
i
ought
to
leave
you
right
here
to
do
the
rest
of
your
big
brave
speechmaking
for
wass
benefit
if
i
did
need
you
that
just
what
i
would
do
if
it
were
for
those
civs
his
head
snapped
back
cheek
to
panel
he
was
listening
again
after
a
long
moment
his
whisper
came
once
more
i
do
have
time
to
repeat
this
in
about
five
minutes
peake
be
here
with
rations
i
leave
this
door
unlatched
there
another
storage
cabin
across
the
corridor
see
if
you
can
hide
there
then
trick
him
into
getting
in
here
and
lock
him
in
got
it
vye
nodded
then
make
for
the
exit
port
here
he
snapped
a
packet
loose
from
his
belt
this
is
a
flare
pak
you
saw
how
they
worked
on
the
island
when
you
get
on
the
ramp
beyond
the
atom
lamp
throw
this
it
should
hit
the
camp
force
barrier
and
the
result
ought
to
hold
their
attention
then
you
head
for
the
flitter
understand
yes
the
flitter
yes
that
was
the
perfect
escape
with
a
camp
force
barrier
on
any
fugitive
could
only
break
out
by
going
straight
up
hume
gazed
at
him
soberly
listened
once
more
and
then
went
vye
counted
a
slow
five
before
he
followed
the
cabin
across
the
corridor
was
open
just
as
hume
had
promised
he
slipped
inside
waited
peake
was
coming
now
the
metallic
plates
on
his
spaceboots
clicking
in
regular
pattern
of
sound
he
earned
another
ration
container
and
crooked
it
in
his
arm
as
he
snapped
up
the
lock
bar
on
the
other
cabin
there
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
vye
went
into
action
his
hand
backed
by
all
the
strength
of
his
thrusting
arm
thumped
between
peake
shoulders
sending
him
staggering
into
the
prison
compartment
before
the
other
could
recover
either
his
balance
or
his
wits
vye
had
the
panel
shut
the
bar
locked
into
place
he
ran
down
the
corridor
to
the
well
ladder
swung
down
its
rungs
with
an
agility
born
of
necessity
then
he
was
in
the
air
lock
getting
his
bearings
the
flitter
stood
to
his
left
the
flashing
atom
lamp
where
the
men
were
gathered
to
his
right
vye
stepped
out
on
the
ramp
he
wiped
his
sweating
hand
across
his
thigh
there
had
to
be
no
failures
in
the
tossing
of
the
flare
pak
choosing
a
spot
not
directly
in
line
with
the
lamp
but
near
enough
to
dazzle
the
men
he
hurled
it
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
then
he
was
running
down
the
ramp
forward
to
the
area
of
the
ship
there
was
a
flash
shouting
vye
curbed
the
impulse
to
look
back
darted
for
the
flitter
he
jerked
open
the
cabin
compartment
scrambled
into
the
cramped
space
behind
the
pilot
seat
leaving
that
free
for
hume
quick
entrance
more
shouting
now
he
saw
the
lines
of
fire
wavering
from
earth
to
sky
along
the
barrier
a
black
shape
put
on
a
burst
of
speed
was
silhouetted
against
that
flaming
wall
then
passed
the
spacer
grabbed
at
the
open
cockpit
and
slid
in
behind
the
controls
hume
pulled
the
levers
with
flying
fingers
they
arose
vertically
at
a
pace
which
practically
slapped
vye
stomach
up
into
the
lower
regions
of
his
throat
the
searing
line
of
at
least
one
blaster
reached
after
them
too
slowly
too
low
he
heard
hume
grunt
and
they
again
leaped
higher
then
the
hunter
spoke
half
an
hour
at
the
most
the
safari
camp
yes
they
no
longer
climbed
the
flitter
was
boring
forwards
on
a
projectile
flight
into
the
dark
of
the
night
what
those
vye
suddenly
leaned
forward
had
some
of
the
stars
across
the
space
void
broken
free
from
their
fixed
orbits
flecks
of
light
moving
in
an
arc
headed
towards
the
speeding
flitter
hume
hit
a
button
again
they
arose
in
a
violent
leap
above
those
wandering
lights
but
ahead
on
this
new
level
more
such
dots
flocked
moving
fast
to
close
in
on
the
flyer
a
straight
ram
course
hume
muttered
more
to
himself
than
vye
again
the
flyer
drove
forward
in
a
rising
thrust
of
speed
then
the
smooth
purr
of
the
propulsion
unit
faltered
broke
into
protesting
coughs
hume
worked
over
the
controls
beads
of
sweat
showing
on
his
forehead
and
cheek
in
the
gleam
of
the
cabin
light
deading
deading
out
he
brought
the
flitter
around
in
a
wide
circle
the
purr
smoothed
out
once
more
in
a
steady
reassuring
beat
out
run
them
but
vye
feared
they
were
back
again
on
the
losing
side
of
a
struggle
with
the
unknown
alien
power
as
they
had
been
herded
along
the
river
so
now
they
were
being
pushed
across
the
sky
towards
the
mountains
the
enemy
had
followed
them
aloft
some
core
of
stubborn
will
in
hume
would
not
yet
allow
him
to
admit
that
time
and
time
again
he
climbed
higher
always
to
meet
climbing
twisting
spurting
lines
of
lights
which
reacted
on
the
engine
of
the
flitter
and
threatened
it
with
complete
failure
where
they
were
now
in
relation
to
wass
camp
or
that
of
the
safari
vye
had
no
idea
and
he
guessed
that
hume
could
not
be
too
certain
hume
switched
on
the
flitter
com
unit
tried
a
channel
search
until
he
picked
up
a
click
of
signal
the
automatic
reply
of
the
safari
camp
his
fingertip
beat
out
in
return
the
danger
warning
then
the
series
of
code
sounds
to
give
an
edited
version
of
what
must
be
guarded
against
wass
has
a
man
in
your
camp
his
skin
is
in
just
as
much
danger
as
the
rest
he
may
not
relay
it
to
the
patrol
but
he
keep
the
force
barrier
up
and
the
civs
inside
anything
else
would
be
malicious
neglect
and
a
murder
charge
when
the
guild
check
tape
goes
in
this
call
is
on
the
spacer
tape
now
and
will
be
a
part
of
that
he
possibly
alter
such
a
report
and
he
knows
it
this
is
the
best
we
can
do
now
we
close
to
the
mountains
are
we
do
you
know
much
about
this
part
of
the
country
vye
persisted
hume
knowledge
might
be
their
only
hope
flew
over
the
range
twice
nothing
to
see
but
there
has
to
be
something
there
if
there
is
it
did
show
up
during
our
survey
hume
voice
was
dull
with
fatigue
you
a
guild
man
you
dealt
with
alien
life
forms
before
the
guild
does
deal
with
intelligent
aliens
that
patrol
business
we
do
land
on
any
planet
with
unknown
intelligent
life
forms
why
should
we
court
trouble
could
run
a
safari
in
under
those
conditions
certified
jumala
as
a
wild
world
our
survey
confirmed
that
someone
or
something
landed
here
after
you
left
i
do
believe
so
this
is
too
well
organized
an
action
and
since
we
have
a
satellite
guard
in
space
any
ship
landing
would
be
taped
and
recorded
no
such
record
appeared
on
the
guild
screens
one
small
spacer
such
as
wass
could
slip
through
by
knowing
procedure
just
as
he
did
but
to
land
all
those
beasts
and
equipment
they
need
a
regular
transport
no
this
must
be
native
hume
leaned
forward
again
flipped
a
switch
a
small
red
light
answered
on
the
central
board
radar
he
explained
so
they
would
end
up
smeared
against
some
cliff
face
anyway
which
was
only
small
comfort
amid
terrifying
possibilities
hume
had
taken
the
precaution
just
in
time
the
light
blinked
faster
and
the
speed
of
the
flyer
was
checked
as
the
automatic
control
triggered
by
the
came
into
command
hume
hands
were
still
on
the
board
but
a
system
of
relays
put
safety
devices
into
action
with
a
speed
past
that
which
a
human
pilot
could
initiate
they
were
descending
and
had
to
accept
that
since
the
operating
for
the
sake
of
the
passengers
had
ruled
that
move
best
the
directive
would
glide
the
flitter
to
the
best
available
landing
it
was
only
moments
before
the
shock
gear
did
touch
surface
then
the
engine
was
silent
this
is
it
hume
observed
what
do
we
do
now
vye
wanted
to
know
wait
wait
for
what
hume
consulted
his
watch
in
the
light
of
the
cabin
we
have
about
an
hour
until
dawn
if
dawn
arrives
here
at
the
same
time
it
does
in
the
plains
i
do
propose
to
go
out
blindly
in
the
dark
which
made
sense
except
that
to
sit
here
quietly
in
their
cramped
quarters
not
knowing
what
might
be
waiting
outside
was
an
ordeal
vye
found
increasingly
harder
to
bear
maybe
hume
guessed
his
discomfort
maybe
he
was
following
routine
procedure
but
he
turned
thumbed
open
one
of
the
side
panels
in
vye
compartment
and
dug
out
the
emergency
supplies
they
sorted
the
crash
rations
into
small
packs
a
blanket
of
the
ozakian
spider
silk
was
cut
into
a
protective
covering
for
vye
that
piece
of
tailoring
occupied
them
until
the
graying
sky
permitted
them
a
full
picture
of
the
pocket
in
which
the
flitter
had
landed
the
dark
foliage
of
the
mountain
growth
was
broken
here
by
a
ledge
of
stone
on
which
the
flyer
rested
to
the
right
was
a
sheer
drop
and
a
land
slip
had
cut
away
the
ledge
itself
a
few
feet
behind
the
flitter
there
was
only
a
steadily
narrowing
path
ahead
slanting
upward
can
we
take
off
again
vye
hoped
to
be
reassured
that
such
a
feat
was
possible
look
up
vye
backed
against
the
cliff
wall
stared
up
at
the
sky
well
above
them
those
globes
still
swam
in
unwearied
circles
commanding
the
air
lanes
hume
had
cautiously
approached
the
outer
rim
of
the
ledge
was
using
his
distance
glasses
to
scan
what
might
lie
below
no
sign
yet
vye
knew
what
he
meant
the
globes
were
overhead
but
the
blue
beasts
or
any
other
fauna
those
balls
might
summon
had
not
yet
appeared
shouldering
their
packs
they
started
along
the
ledge
hume
had
his
ray
tube
but
vye
was
weaponless
unless
somewhere
along
their
route
he
could
pick
up
some
defensive
and
offensive
arm
stones
had
burst
the
lights
of
the
islet
they
might
prove
as
effective
against
the
blue
beasts
he
kept
watch
for
any
of
the
proper
size
and
weight
the
ledge
narrowed
one
shoulder
scraped
the
cliff
now
as
they
rounded
a
pinnacle
to
lose
sight
of
the
flitter
but
the
globes
continued
to
hover
over
them
we
are
still
traveling
in
the
direction
they
want
vye
speculated
hume
had
gone
to
hands
and
knees
to
negotiate
an
ascent
so
steep
he
had
to
search
for
head
and
toe
holds
when
they
were
safely
past
that
point
they
took
a
breather
and
vye
glanced
aloft
again
now
the
sky
was
empty
we
may
have
arrived
or
are
about
to
do
so
said
hume
where
hume
shrugged
your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine
and
both
of
us
can
be
wrong
the
steep
ascent
did
not
quite
reach
the
top
of
the
cliff
around
the
face
of
which
the
ledge
curled
instead
their
path
now
leveled
off
and
began
to
widen
out
so
that
they
could
walk
with
more
confidence
then
it
threaded
into
a
crevice
between
two
towering
rock
walls
and
sloped
downward
a
path
unnaturally
smooth
vye
thought
as
if
shaped
to
funnel
wayfarers
on
and
they
came
out
on
the
rim
of
a
valley
a
valley
centered
with
a
lake
they
stepped
from
the
rock
of
the
passage
onto
a
springy
turf
which
gave
elastically
to
their
tread
vye
sandal
struck
a
round
stone
it
started
from
its
bed
in
the
vegetation
turned
over
so
that
round
pits
stared
eyelessly
up
at
him
he
was
faced
by
the
fleshless
grin
of
a
human
skull
hume
went
down
on
one
knee
examined
the
ground
growth
gingerly
lifted
the
lace
of
vertebrae
forming
a
spine
that
ended
in
a
crushed
break
which
he
studied
briefly
before
he
laid
the
bones
gently
back
into
the
concealing
cover
of
the
mossy
stuff
that
was
done
by
teeth
the
cup
of
green
valley
had
not
changed
it
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
when
they
had
emerged
from
the
crevice
but
now
every
clump
of
trees
every
mound
of
brush
promised
cover
vye
moistened
his
lips
diverted
his
eyes
from
the
skull
weathered
hume
said
slowly
must
have
been
here
for
seasons
maybe
planet
years
a
survivor
from
the
yet
this
spot
lay
days
of
travel
from
that
clearing
back
in
the
plains
how
did
he
get
here
probably
the
same
way
we
would
have
had
we
not
holed
up
on
that
river
island
driven
perhaps
the
lone
human
on
jumala
herded
up
into
this
valley
by
the
globes
or
the
blue
beasts
this
process
must
have
been
in
action
for
some
time
why
i
can
give
you
two
reasons
hume
studied
the
nearest
trees
narrowly
first
for
some
purpose
whatever
we
are
up
against
wants
all
interlopers
moved
out
of
the
lowlands
into
this
section
either
to
imprison
them
or
to
keep
them
under
surveillance
second
he
hesitated
vye
own
imagination
supplied
a
second
reason
a
revolting
one
he
tried
to
deny
to
himself
even
as
he
put
it
into
words
that
broken
spine
food
vye
wanted
hume
to
contradict
him
but
the
hunter
only
glanced
around
his
expression
already
sufficient
answer
let
get
out
of
here
vye
was
fighting
down
panic
with
every
ounce
of
control
he
could
summon
trying
not
to
bolt
for
the
crevice
but
he
knew
he
could
not
force
himself
any
farther
into
that
sinister
valley
if
we
can
hume
words
lingered
direly
in
his
ears
stones
had
smashed
the
globes
by
the
river
if
they
still
waited
out
there
vye
was
willing
to
try
and
break
them
with
his
bare
hands
should
escape
demand
such
action
hume
must
have
agreed
with
those
thoughts
he
was
already
taking
long
strides
back
to
the
cliff
entrance
but
that
door
was
closed
hume
foot
raised
for
the
last
step
toward
the
crevice
corridor
struck
an
invisible
obstruction
he
reeled
back
clutching
at
vye
shoulder
something
there
the
younger
man
put
out
his
hand
questingly
what
his
fingers
flattened
against
was
not
a
tight
solid
surface
but
rather
an
unseen
elastic
curtain
which
gave
a
little
under
his
prodding
and
then
drew
taut
again
together
they
explored
by
touch
what
they
could
not
see
the
crevice
through
which
they
had
entered
was
now
closed
with
a
curtain
they
could
not
pierce
or
break
hume
tried
his
ray
tube
they
watched
thin
flame
run
up
and
down
that
invisible
barrier
but
not
destroy
it
hume
relooped
the
tube
their
trap
is
sprung
there
may
be
another
way
out
but
vye
was
already
despondently
sure
there
was
not
those
who
had
rigged
this
trap
would
leave
no
bolt
holes
but
because
they
were
human
and
refused
to
accept
the
inevitable
without
a
fight
the
captives
set
off
not
down
into
the
curve
of
the
cup
but
along
its
slope
tongues
of
brush
and
tree
clumps
brought
about
detours
which
forced
them
slowly
downward
they
were
well
away
from
the
crevice
when
hume
halted
flung
up
a
hand
in
silent
warning
vye
listened
trying
to
pick
up
the
sound
which
had
alarmed
his
companion
it
was
as
vye
strained
to
catch
a
betraying
noise
that
he
was
first
conscious
of
what
he
did
not
hear
in
the
plains
there
had
been
squeaking
humming
chitterings
the
vocalizing
of
myriad
grass
dwellers
here
except
for
the
sighing
of
the
wind
and
a
few
insect
sounds
nothing
all
inhabitants
bigger
than
a
jumalan
fly
might
have
long
ago
been
routed
out
of
the
land
to
the
left
hume
faced
about
there
was
a
heavy
thicket
there
too
stoutly
grown
for
anything
to
be
within
its
shadow
whatever
moved
must
be
behind
it
vye
looked
about
him
frantically
for
anything
he
could
use
as
a
weapon
then
he
grabbed
at
the
long
bush
knife
in
hume
belt
sheath
eighteen
inches
of
steel
gleamed
wickedly
its
hilt
fitting
neatly
into
his
fist
as
he
held
it
point
up
ready
hume
advanced
on
the
bush
in
small
steps
and
vye
circled
to
his
left
a
few
paces
behind
the
hunter
was
an
expert
with
ray
tube
that
too
was
part
of
the
necessary
skill
of
a
safari
leader
but
vye
could
offer
other
help
he
shrugged
out
of
the
blanket
pack
he
had
been
carrying
on
his
back
tossed
that
burden
ahead
out
of
cover
charged
a
streak
of
red
to
land
on
the
bait
hume
blasted
was
answered
by
a
scream
the
feline
writhed
out
of
its
life
in
a
stench
of
scorched
fur
and
flesh
as
vye
retrieved
his
clawed
pack
hume
stood
over
the
dead
animal
odd
he
reached
down
to
grasp
a
still
twitching
foreleg
stretched
the
body
out
with
a
sudden
jerk
it
was
a
giant
of
its
species
a
male
larger
than
any
he
had
seen
but
a
second
look
showed
him
those
ribs
starting
through
mangy
fur
in
visible
hoops
the
skin
tight
over
the
skull
far
too
tight
the
had
been
close
to
death
by
starvation
its
attack
on
the
men
probably
had
been
sparked
by
sheer
desperation
a
starving
carnivore
in
a
land
lacking
the
normal
sounds
of
small
birds
and
animal
life
in
a
valley
used
as
a
trap
no
way
out
and
no
food
vye
fitted
one
thought
to
another
out
loud
yes
pin
the
enemy
up
let
them
finish
off
one
another
but
why
vye
demanded
least
trouble
that
way
there
are
plenty
of
down
on
the
plains
all
of
them
could
be
herded
up
here
to
finish
each
other
off
it
would
take
years
centuries
this
one
capture
may
have
been
only
incidental
or
done
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
some
type
of
machinery
in
working
order
hume
replied
i
do
believe
this
was
arranged
just
to
dispose
of
suppose
this
was
started
a
long
time
ago
and
those
who
did
it
are
gone
so
now
it
goes
on
working
without
any
real
intelligence
behind
it
that
could
be
the
answer
could
it
some
process
triggers
into
action
when
a
ship
sets
down
on
this
portion
of
jumala
maybe
when
one
planet
under
certain
conditions
only
yes
that
makes
sense
only
why
was
the
first
patrol
explorer
flaming
in
here
caught
and
the
survey
team
we
were
here
for
months
cataloguing
mapping
not
a
whisper
of
any
such
trouble
that
dead
man
he
been
here
a
long
time
and
when
did
the
largo
drift
disappear
five
six
years
ago
but
i
ca
give
you
any
answers
i
have
none
it
began
as
a
low
hum
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
distant
howling
of
the
wind
then
it
slid
up
scale
until
the
thin
wail
became
an
ululating
scream
torturing
the
ears
dragging
out
of
hiding
those
fears
of
a
man
confronting
the
unknown
in
the
dark
hume
tugged
at
vye
drew
the
other
by
force
back
into
the
brush
scratched
laced
raw
by
the
whip
of
branches
they
stood
in
a
small
hollow
with
the
drift
of
leaves
high
about
their
ankles
and
the
hunter
pulled
into
place
the
portions
of
growth
they
had
dislodged
in
their
passage
into
the
thicket
heart
through
gaps
they
could
see
the
opening
where
lay
the
body
of
the
the
wail
was
cut
off
short
that
cessation
in
itself
a
warning
body
touching
earth
with
knee
and
hand
as
he
crouched
picked
up
a
vibration
whatever
came
towards
them
walked
heavily
did
the
smell
of
death
draw
it
now
or
had
it
trailed
them
from
the
closed
gate
hume
breath
hissed
lightly
between
his
teeth
he
was
sighting
the
ray
tube
through
a
leaf
gap
a
snuffling
heavier
than
a
man
panting
a
vast
blot
which
was
neither
clearly
paw
nor
hand
swept
aside
leaves
and
branches
on
the
other
side
of
the
small
clearing
tearing
them
casually
from
the
shrubs
what
shuffled
into
the
open
might
be
a
cousin
of
the
blue
beasts
but
where
they
had
given
only
an
impression
of
brutal
menace
this
was
savagery
incarnate
taller
than
hume
but
hunched
forward
in
its
neckless
outline
the
thing
was
a
monster
and
over
the
round
of
the
lower
jaw
tusks
protruded
in
ugly
promise
being
carnivorous
and
hungry
it
scooped
up
the
body
of
the
and
fed
without
any
prolonged
ceremony
vye
remembering
the
crushed
spine
of
the
human
skeleton
was
sickened
done
it
reared
on
hind
feet
once
again
the
head
swung
in
their
direction
vye
was
half
certain
he
had
seen
that
expand
to
test
the
air
and
scent
them
hume
pressed
the
button
of
the
ray
tube
that
soundless
spear
of
death
struck
in
midsection
of
that
barrel
body
the
thing
howled
threw
itself
in
a
mad
forward
rush
at
their
bush
hume
snapped
a
second
blast
at
the
head
and
the
fuzz
covering
it
blackened
missing
them
by
a
precious
foot
the
creature
crashed
straight
on
through
the
thicket
coming
to
its
knees
writhing
in
a
rising
chorus
of
howls
the
men
broke
out
of
cover
raced
into
the
open
where
they
took
refuge
behind
a
chimney
of
rock
half
detached
from
the
parent
cliff
down
the
slope
the
bushes
were
still
wildly
agitated
what
was
that
vye
got
out
between
sobbing
breaths
maybe
a
guardian
or
a
patrol
stationed
to
dispose
of
any
catch
probably
not
alone
either
hume
fingered
his
ray
tube
and
i
am
down
to
one
full
charge
just
one
vye
turned
the
knife
he
held
around
in
his
fingers
tried
to
imagine
how
one
could
face
up
to
one
of
those
tusked
monsters
with
only
this
for
a
weapon
but
if
that
thing
had
companions
none
were
coming
in
answer
to
its
dying
wails
and
after
it
had
been
quiet
for
a
while
hume
motioned
them
out
of
hiding
from
now
on
we
keep
to
the
open
better
see
trouble
like
that
before
it
arrives
and
i
want
to
find
a
place
to
hole
up
for
the
night
they
trailed
along
the
steep
upper
slope
and
in
time
found
a
place
where
a
now
dried
stream
had
once
formed
a
falls
the
empty
watercourse
provided
an
overhang
not
quite
a
cave
but
shelter
gathering
brush
and
stones
they
made
a
barricade
and
settled
behind
it
to
eat
sparingly
of
their
rations
water
a
whole
lake
of
it
down
there
the
worst
of
it
is
that
a
water
supply
in
a
dry
country
is
just
where
hunters
congregate
that
entirely
walled
in
by
woodland
and
provides
cover
for
a
thousand
ambushes
we
might
find
a
way
out
before
our
water
bulbs
fail
vye
offered
hume
did
not
answer
directly
a
man
can
live
for
quite
a
while
on
very
thin
rations
and
we
have
tablets
from
the
flitter
emergency
supplies
but
he
ca
live
long
without
water
we
have
two
bulbs
with
stretching
that
is
enough
for
two
days
maybe
three
we
ought
to
get
completely
around
the
cliffs
in
another
day
and
if
we
do
find
a
way
out
which
i
doubt
we
still
going
to
need
water
for
the
trek
out
it
right
down
there
waiting
until
our
need
is
greater
than
either
our
fear
or
our
cunning
vye
moved
impatiently
his
shoulders
scraping
the
rock
at
their
backs
you
do
think
we
have
a
chance
we
are
dead
and
as
long
as
a
man
is
breathing
and
on
his
feet
with
all
his
wits
in
his
skull
he
always
has
a
chance
i
blasted
with
odds
stacked
high
on
the
other
side
of
the
board
he
flexed
that
hand
which
was
so
nearly
human
and
yet
not
by
the
fraction
which
had
changed
the
course
of
his
life
i
lived
on
the
edge
of
the
big
blackout
for
a
long
time
now
after
a
while
you
can
get
used
to
anything
one
thing
i
would
like
to
get
at
the
one
who
set
this
trap
commented
vye
hume
laughed
with
dry
humor
after
me
boy
after
me
but
i
think
we
might
have
to
wait
a
long
time
for
that
meeting
vye
crawled
weakly
from
the
area
of
a
rock
outcrop
the
sun
reflected
from
the
cliff
side
was
a
lash
of
fire
across
his
emaciated
body
his
swollen
tongue
moved
a
pebble
back
and
forth
in
his
dry
mouth
he
stared
dimly
down
the
slope
to
that
beckoning
platter
of
water
open
under
the
sun
rimmed
with
the
deadly
woodland
what
had
happened
they
had
gone
to
sleep
that
first
night
under
the
ledge
of
the
dried
waterfall
and
all
of
the
next
day
was
only
a
haze
to
him
now
they
must
have
moved
on
though
he
could
remember
nothing
save
hume
odd
behavior
silence
while
stumbling
on
as
a
brainless
incoherent
speech
wherein
all
the
words
came
fast
running
together
unintelligibly
and
for
himself
patches
of
blackout
at
some
time
they
had
come
to
the
cave
and
hume
had
collapsed
not
rousing
in
answer
to
any
of
vye
struggles
to
awaken
him
how
long
they
had
been
there
vye
could
not
tell
now
he
had
the
fear
of
being
left
alone
in
this
place
with
water
perhaps
hume
could
be
returned
to
consciousness
but
that
was
all
gone
vye
believed
he
could
scent
the
lake
that
every
breeze
up
slope
brought
its
compelling
enticement
just
in
case
hume
might
awake
to
a
state
of
and
wander
off
vye
tethered
him
with
blanket
bonds
vye
fingered
hume
knife
which
had
been
painstakingly
lashed
to
a
trimmed
shaft
of
wood
since
he
had
emerged
from
that
clouding
of
mind
which
still
gripped
the
hunter
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
prepare
for
another
attack
from
any
roving
beast
and
he
also
had
hume
ray
tube
its
single
charge
to
be
used
only
in
dire
need
water
his
cracked
lips
moved
ejected
the
pebble
their
four
empty
water
bulbs
were
in
the
front
of
his
blanket
tunic
pressing
against
his
ribs
it
was
now
or
die
because
soon
he
would
be
too
weak
to
make
the
attempt
at
all
he
darted
for
the
first
stand
of
bush
downhill
as
the
brooding
silence
of
the
valley
continued
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
wood
unhindered
intent
on
his
mission
with
a
concentration
which
shut
out
everything
save
his
need
and
the
manner
of
satisfying
it
he
squatted
in
the
bush
eyeing
the
length
of
woodland
ahead
then
he
tried
the
only
action
he
had
been
able
to
think
out
that
beast
hume
had
killed
had
been
too
heavy
to
swing
up
in
trees
but
vye
own
weight
now
did
not
prohibit
that
form
of
travel
with
spear
and
ray
tube
firmly
attached
to
him
vye
climbed
into
the
first
tree
a
slim
chance
but
his
only
defense
against
a
possible
ambush
a
wild
outward
swing
brought
him
to
the
next
set
of
limbs
then
he
had
a
piece
of
luck
a
looped
vine
tied
together
a
whole
group
of
branches
from
one
treetop
to
the
next
hand
grips
balance
sometimes
a
walk
along
a
branch
he
threaded
towards
the
lake
then
he
came
to
a
gap
with
hands
laced
into
tendrils
vye
hunched
to
look
down
on
a
beaten
ribbon
of
gray
earth
a
trail
well
used
by
the
evidence
of
its
pounded
surface
that
area
had
to
be
crossed
on
foot
but
his
passage
through
the
brush
below
would
leave
traces
only
there
was
no
other
way
vye
checked
the
lashings
of
his
weapons
again
before
leaping
almost
in
the
same
instant
his
sandals
hit
the
packed
earth
he
was
running
his
palms
skinned
raw
on
rough
bark
as
he
somehow
scrambled
aloft
once
more
no
more
vines
but
broad
limbs
shooting
well
out
he
dropped
from
one
to
for
breath
listened
the
dark
gloom
of
the
wood
was
broken
by
sunlight
he
was
at
the
final
ring
of
trees
to
get
to
the
water
he
must
descend
again
a
dead
trunk
extended
over
the
water
if
he
could
run
out
on
that
and
lower
the
bulb
it
could
work
eerie
silence
no
flying
things
no
tree
dwelling
reptiles
or
animals
no
disturbance
of
any
water
creature
on
the
unruffled
surface
of
the
lake
yet
the
sensation
of
life
inimical
life
lurking
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
under
the
water
bore
in
upon
him
vye
made
the
light
leap
to
the
bole
of
the
dead
tree
balanced
out
on
it
over
the
water
moving
slowly
as
the
trunk
settled
a
little
under
his
weight
he
hunkered
down
brought
out
the
first
bulb
tied
fast
to
a
blanket
string
the
water
of
the
river
had
been
brown
opaque
but
here
the
liquid
was
not
so
cloudy
he
could
see
snags
of
dead
branches
below
its
surface
and
something
else
down
in
those
turgid
depths
he
made
out
a
straight
ridge
running
with
a
trueness
of
line
which
could
not
be
nature
unassisted
product
that
ridge
joined
another
in
a
squared
corner
he
leaned
over
strained
his
eyes
to
follow
through
the
murk
the
farther
extent
of
those
two
ridges
looked
along
both
pointed
protuberances
aimed
at
the
surfaces
of
the
lake
like
fangs
in
an
open
jaw
down
there
was
something
something
artificially
fashioned
which
might
be
the
answer
to
all
their
questions
but
to
venture
into
the
lake
himself
he
could
not
do
it
if
he
could
bring
the
to
his
senses
the
other
might
find
the
solution
to
this
puzzle
vye
filled
his
bulbs
working
speedily
but
still
studying
what
he
could
see
of
the
strange
erection
under
the
lake
he
thought
it
was
curiously
free
of
silt
and
its
color
as
far
as
he
could
distinguish
allowing
for
the
dark
hue
of
the
water
was
light
gray
perhaps
even
white
he
lowered
his
last
bulb
down
in
the
bleached
forest
of
dead
branches
well
to
one
side
of
the
mysterious
walls
there
was
movement
a
slow
rolling
of
a
shadow
so
hidden
by
a
stirring
of
bottom
mud
that
vye
could
not
make
out
its
true
form
but
it
was
rising
to
the
bulb
vye
hated
to
lose
a
single
precious
drop
once
he
might
have
the
luck
to
make
this
journey
unmolested
a
second
time
the
odds
could
be
too
high
a
flash
the
slowly
rising
shadow
was
transformed
into
a
whizzing
spear
of
attack
vye
snapped
the
bulb
out
of
the
water
just
as
a
nightmarish
armored
head
arose
on
a
whiplash
of
coiled
scaled
neck
and
a
blunt
nose
thudded
against
the
tree
trunk
with
a
hollow
boom
vye
clung
to
his
perch
as
the
thing
flopped
back
into
deeper
water
from
a
froth
of
beaten
foam
leaving
a
patch
of
odorous
scum
and
slime
to
bracelet
the
waterlogged
wood
he
ran
for
the
shelter
of
the
trees
to
get
away
this
time
there
was
no
rear
no
thump
of
feet
in
warning
out
of
the
ground
itself
or
so
it
seemed
to
vye
startled
terror
reared
one
of
the
tusked
beasts
to
reach
his
tree
and
its
dubious
safety
he
had
to
wind
past
that
chimera
and
the
creature
waited
with
a
semblance
of
ease
for
him
to
come
to
it
vye
brought
around
his
spear
the
length
of
the
haft
might
afford
him
a
fighting
chance
if
he
could
send
the
point
home
in
some
vulnerable
spot
yet
he
knew
that
the
beasts
were
hard
to
kill
the
mouth
opened
in
a
wide
grin
of
menace
vye
noted
a
telltale
tightening
of
shoulder
muscles
it
was
going
to
rush
for
him
now
with
those
clawed
forepaws
out
to
rip
to
wait
was
to
court
disaster
vye
shouted
his
battle
cry
piercing
the
silence
of
the
lake
and
wood
he
sprang
aiming
the
spear
point
at
the
beast
protuberant
belly
and
then
swerved
to
the
side
as
the
knife
bit
home
raking
his
weapon
to
open
a
gaping
wound
the
spear
was
jerked
from
vye
hold
as
both
those
taloned
paws
closed
on
it
then
the
creature
pulled
it
free
snapped
the
haft
in
two
vye
fired
a
short
blast
from
the
ray
tube
before
it
could
turn
on
him
saw
afire
as
he
ran
for
the
tree
beneath
its
branches
he
looked
back
the
beast
was
pawing
at
the
burning
fur
on
its
head
and
he
had
perhaps
a
second
or
two
he
jumped
and
his
fingers
caught
on
the
low
hanging
branch
then
he
made
a
superhuman
effort
was
up
out
of
the
path
of
the
thing
which
rushed
blindly
for
the
tree
shrieking
in
frenzied
complaint
the
huge
body
crashed
against
the
trunk
with
force
which
nearly
shook
vye
from
his
hold
as
the
giant
forepaws
belabored
the
wood
strove
to
lift
the
body
from
the
ground
vye
worked
his
way
out
on
another
branch
in
the
end
it
was
the
shaking
of
that
limb
under
him
which
aided
his
swing
to
the
next
tree
and
from
there
he
traveled
recklessly
intent
only
on
getting
out
of
the
woods
as
fast
as
he
could
by
the
noise
the
beast
was
still
assaulting
the
tree
and
vye
marveled
at
its
vitality
for
the
belly
wound
would
long
ago
have
killed
any
creature
he
knew
whether
it
could
trace
his
flight
aloft
or
whether
its
howls
would
bring
more
of
its
kind
he
could
not
guess
but
every
second
he
could
gain
was
all
important
now
at
the
gap
over
the
trail
he
hesitated
that
path
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
open
and
to
go
on
foot
meant
the
possibility
of
greater
speed
vye
slipped
from
the
bough
hit
the
ground
and
ran
his
ragged
lungsful
of
air
came
in
great
gasps
and
he
doubted
if
he
could
take
the
exertion
of
more
tree
travel
now
he
raced
down
the
path
those
mewling
cries
were
louder
he
was
sure
of
it
now
he
heard
the
thump
of
the
beast
blundering
pursuit
behind
him
but
its
bulk
and
hurts
slowed
it
in
the
open
he
could
find
cover
behind
a
rock
use
the
ray
again
the
trees
began
to
thin
vye
summoned
power
for
a
last
burst
of
speed
came
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
wood
as
might
a
dart
expelled
from
a
needler
before
him
up
slope
was
the
closed
door
of
the
valley
and
moving
in
from
the
left
was
another
of
the
blue
beasts
he
could
not
retreat
to
the
trees
but
the
newcomer
was
moving
with
the
same
ponderous
its
fellow
had
shown
earlier
vye
dodged
right
headed
for
the
rocks
by
the
gap
as
he
pulled
himself
into
that
temporary
fortification
the
wounded
beast
dragged
out
of
the
woods
below
he
thought
it
was
blind
yet
some
instinct
drove
it
after
him
shaking
from
fatigue
vye
steadied
his
forearm
on
the
top
of
the
rock
brought
up
the
ray
tube
less
than
two
yards
away
now
was
the
deceptively
open
mouth
of
the
gap
if
he
threw
himself
at
that
would
the
elasticity
of
the
unseen
curtain
hurl
him
back
into
the
claws
of
the
enemy
he
fired
his
blast
at
the
head
of
the
unwounded
beast
it
screeched
threw
out
its
arms
and
one
of
those
paws
struck
against
its
wounded
fellow
with
a
cry
that
one
flung
itself
at
its
companion
in
the
hunt
and
they
tangled
in
a
battle
terrible
in
its
utter
ferocity
vye
edged
along
the
cliff
determined
to
reach
the
cave
and
hume
and
the
two
blue
things
seemed
intent
on
finishing
each
other
off
the
one
from
the
wood
was
done
the
fangs
of
the
other
ripping
out
its
throat
tearing
viciously
the
victor
made
sure
of
its
kill
then
its
seared
head
came
up
swung
about
to
face
vye
he
guessed
it
was
aware
of
his
movements
whether
it
could
see
or
not
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
speed
of
its
attacking
lunge
heretofore
the
creatures
had
given
the
impression
of
brute
strength
rather
than
agility
and
he
had
been
almost
fatally
deceived
he
jumped
backwards
knowing
he
must
elude
that
attack
for
he
could
not
survive
combat
with
the
alien
thing
there
was
a
moment
of
dazed
disorientation
a
weird
sensation
of
falling
through
unstable
space
in
which
there
had
never
been
and
never
would
be
firm
footing
again
he
was
rolling
across
rock
outside
the
curtain
of
the
gap
he
sat
up
the
feeling
of
being
adrift
in
unmeasurable
nothingness
making
him
sick
to
watch
mistily
as
the
blue
beast
came
to
a
halt
whimpering
it
turned
but
before
it
reached
the
level
of
the
woods
it
sagged
to
its
knees
fell
face
forward
and
was
still
a
destructive
machine
no
longer
controlled
by
life
vye
tried
to
understand
what
had
happened
he
had
somehow
broken
through
that
barrier
which
made
the
valley
a
prison
for
a
moment
all
that
mattered
was
his
freedom
then
he
looked
apprehensively
behind
him
along
the
road
to
the
open
more
than
half
expecting
to
see
a
gathering
of
the
globes
or
of
the
less
impressive
lowland
beasts
that
acted
as
herders
but
there
was
nothing
freedom
he
dragged
himself
to
his
feet
free
to
go
he
slipped
ray
tube
back
into
his
belt
hume
was
still
in
the
valley
vye
rubbed
his
shaking
hands
across
his
face
through
the
barrier
and
free
but
hume
was
back
there
without
a
weapon
defenseless
against
any
questing
beast
able
to
nose
him
out
sickly
without
water
and
protection
he
was
a
dead
man
even
while
he
still
breathed
keeping
one
hand
against
the
wall
of
the
gap
in
support
vye
started
to
walk
not
out
of
the
gap
towards
the
distant
lowlands
but
back
into
the
valley
forcing
himself
to
that
by
his
will
alone
and
screaming
inside
against
such
suicidal
folly
he
put
out
his
hand
tentatively
when
he
reached
the
two
points
of
rock
where
that
curtain
had
hung
there
was
no
obstruction
the
barrier
was
down
he
must
get
back
to
hume
still
keeping
his
wall
hold
vye
lurched
through
the
gate
was
once
more
in
the
valley
he
stood
swaying
listening
but
once
again
there
was
silence
not
even
the
wind
moved
through
trees
or
bushes
placing
one
foot
carefully
before
the
other
he
went
on
towards
hume
cave
the
haze
which
had
clouded
his
thinking
processes
since
that
first
morning
awakening
in
this
bowl
was
gone
now
except
for
the
physical
weakness
that
weighted
his
body
he
felt
once
more
entirely
alive
and
alert
wriggling
in
the
cave
entrance
was
the
hunter
he
had
freed
the
bonds
vye
had
put
on
his
legs
but
his
hands
were
still
tied
his
face
grimy
was
turned
up
to
the
sunlight
and
his
eyes
were
again
bright
with
reason
vye
found
the
strength
to
run
the
last
few
feet
between
them
he
was
fumbling
with
those
ties
about
hume
wrists
as
he
blurted
out
the
news
the
barrier
was
out
they
could
go
then
he
was
bringing
one
of
those
precious
bulbs
raising
it
to
eager
mouth
squeezing
a
portion
of
its
contents
between
the
cracked
and
bleeding
lips
somehow
they
made
that
trip
back
to
the
valley
gate
when
they
saw
their
goal
hume
broke
from
vye
hold
tottered
forward
with
a
cry
not
far
removed
from
a
sob
he
rebounded
to
slip
full
length
to
the
ground
and
lie
there
sobbing
dryly
his
gaunt
face
eyes
closed
turned
up
to
the
sky
the
trap
had
snapped
shut
once
again
why
why
vye
found
he
was
repeating
the
same
words
over
and
over
his
gaze
blank
unfocussed
yet
turned
to
the
woods
of
the
lake
tell
me
what
happened
again
vye
head
came
around
hume
had
pulled
himself
up
so
that
his
shoulders
rested
against
the
rock
wall
his
was
slipping
up
and
down
what
seemed
empty
air
but
which
was
the
barrier
against
freedom
and
now
his
eyes
seemed
entirely
sane
slowly
hesitating
between
words
vye
went
over
the
full
account
of
his
visit
to
the
lake
his
retreat
before
the
beasts
his
fortunate
stumble
through
the
gap
but
you
came
back
vye
flushed
he
was
not
going
to
try
to
explain
that
instead
he
said
if
it
went
away
once
it
can
again
hume
did
not
press
the
subject
of
his
return
rather
he
fastened
upon
the
end
of
that
action
with
the
wounded
beast
made
vye
go
through
it
verbally
a
third
time
there
is
just
this
he
said
when
the
other
was
done
when
you
fell
you
were
not
thinking
of
the
barrier
at
all
and
your
wits
were
working
again
you
had
come
out
of
the
daze
we
both
had
vye
tried
to
remember
decided
that
the
hunter
was
correct
he
had
been
trying
to
elude
the
charge
of
the
beast
only
fear
and
that
desperate
desire
had
occupied
his
mind
at
that
moment
but
what
did
that
signify
to
test
just
what
he
did
not
know
he
crawled
now
to
hume
side
put
up
his
own
hand
to
the
space
where
the
palm
slid
back
and
forth
on
nothingness
but
he
almost
fell
on
his
face
forward
into
the
gap
where
he
had
been
expecting
the
resistance
of
the
unseen
curtain
there
had
been
nothing
at
all
he
turned
to
hume
with
the
expression
of
a
man
who
had
been
stunned
by
an
unexpected
blow
it
is
open
for
you
hume
broke
the
quiet
first
his
eyes
were
very
bleak
in
his
bony
face
vye
stood
up
took
one
step
and
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
where
hume
hand
still
found
substance
he
came
back
with
the
same
lack
of
hindrance
yes
to
him
there
was
no
longer
a
barrier
but
why
why
him
when
hume
was
still
a
prisoner
the
hunter
raised
his
head
so
his
eyes
could
meet
vye
with
the
authority
of
an
order
go
get
away
while
you
can
instead
vye
dropped
down
beside
the
other
why
he
asked
baldly
and
then
the
most
obvious
of
all
answers
came
he
glanced
at
hume
the
hunter
head
lolled
back
against
the
rock
which
supported
him
his
eyes
were
closed
now
and
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
been
driven
to
the
edge
of
endurance
and
was
now
willing
to
relinquish
his
grip
and
let
go
deliberately
vye
brought
up
his
right
hand
balled
his
fingers
into
a
fist
and
just
as
deliberately
he
struck
home
square
on
the
point
of
that
defenseless
chin
hume
sagged
would
have
slipped
down
the
surface
of
the
rock
had
vye
hands
not
caught
in
his
armpits
since
he
had
not
the
strength
left
to
get
to
his
feet
with
such
a
burden
vye
crawled
dragging
the
inert
body
of
the
hunter
with
him
and
this
time
as
he
had
hoped
there
was
no
resistance
at
the
gap
unconscious
hume
was
able
to
cross
the
barrier
vye
stretched
him
as
comfortably
flat
as
he
could
used
a
portion
of
their
water
on
his
face
until
he
moaned
muttered
and
raised
his
hand
feebly
to
his
head
then
those
gray
eyes
opened
focussed
on
vye
what
we
both
through
now
both
of
us
the
younger
man
saw
hume
glance
around
him
with
waking
belief
but
how
i
knocked
you
out
that
how
vye
returned
knocked
me
out
i
crossed
when
i
was
unconscious
hume
voice
steadied
strengthened
let
me
see
he
rolled
over
on
his
side
threw
out
his
arm
and
this
time
the
hand
found
no
wall
for
him
too
the
barrier
was
gone
once
through
you
are
free
he
added
wonderingly
maybe
they
never
foresaw
any
escapes
he
struggled
up
sitting
with
his
hands
hanging
loosely
between
his
knees
vye
turned
his
head
looked
down
the
trail
the
length
of
distance
lying
between
them
and
the
safari
camp
now
faced
them
with
a
new
problem
neither
of
them
could
make
that
trek
on
foot
we
out
but
we
are
back
yet
hume
echoed
his
thought
i
was
wondering
if
door
is
open
vye
began
the
flitter
again
hume
mind
matched
his
yes
if
those
globes
are
hanging
around
just
waiting
for
us
to
try
they
might
act
only
to
get
us
here
not
to
keep
us
once
we
in
that
might
be
wishful
thinking
they
would
know
until
they
tried
to
prove
it
give
me
a
hand
hume
held
out
his
own
let
vye
pull
him
to
his
feet
weak
as
he
was
he
was
plainly
once
more
let
go
together
they
went
back
through
the
gap
then
tested
the
absence
of
the
barrier
once
more
to
make
sure
hume
laughed
at
least
the
front
door
remains
open
even
if
we
find
the
back
one
closed
vye
left
him
sitting
by
that
entrance
while
he
made
a
quick
trip
to
the
cave
to
pick
up
the
small
pack
of
supplies
left
them
when
he
returned
they
crammed
tablets
into
their
mouths
drank
feverishly
of
the
lake
water
and
with
the
stimulation
of
the
new
energy
set
off
along
the
cliff
face
this
wall
in
the
lake
hume
asked
suddenly
you
are
sure
it
is
artificial
runs
too
straight
to
be
anything
else
and
those
projections
are
evenly
spaced
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
natural
we
have
to
be
sure
vye
thought
of
that
attacking
water
creature
no
diving
in
there
he
protested
hume
smiled
a
stretch
of
skin
far
too
tight
over
his
jaw
now
not
us
at
least
not
us
now
he
agreed
but
the
guild
will
send
another
survey
what
could
be
the
reason
for
all
this
vye
helped
his
companion
over
the
loose
debris
of
a
cliff
slide
information
what
someone
or
something
picked
our
brains
while
we
were
out
of
our
heads
or
hume
paused
suddenly
looked
directly
at
vye
i
have
a
vague
feeling
that
you
were
able
to
keep
going
a
lot
better
than
i
was
that
so
some
of
the
time
vye
admitted
that
checks
part
of
me
knew
what
was
going
on
but
was
helpless
while
that
other
thing
his
smile
of
moments
earlier
was
wiped
away
there
was
a
chill
edge
in
his
voice
picked
over
my
brains
sorted
out
what
it
wanted
vye
shook
his
head
i
did
feel
that
way
just
as
if
i
were
sleep
walking
and
yet
awake
so
it
took
me
over
but
did
go
all
the
way
with
you
why
another
question
for
our
list
maybe
maybe
wass
techs
fixed
it
so
i
could
be
as
you
call
it
vye
offered
hume
nodded
could
be
would
well
be
come
on
he
pressed
the
pace
now
vye
turned
to
look
down
the
slope
suspiciously
had
hume
another
warning
of
menace
out
of
the
wood
he
could
sight
no
movement
there
and
from
this
distance
the
lake
was
a
topaz
sheet
of
calm
which
could
hide
anything
hume
was
already
several
paces
ahead
scrambling
as
if
the
valley
monsters
were
again
on
their
track
what
the
matter
vye
demanded
as
he
caught
up
night
coming
which
was
true
then
hume
added
if
we
can
reach
the
flitter
before
sunset
we
have
a
chance
to
fly
over
the
lake
down
there
to
make
a
taping
of
it
before
we
go
the
energy
of
the
tablets
strengthened
them
so
that
by
the
time
they
reached
the
crevice
door
they
were
moving
with
their
former
agility
for
a
single
second
hume
hesitated
before
that
slit
almost
as
if
he
feared
the
test
he
must
make
then
he
stepped
forward
and
this
time
into
freedom
they
reached
the
ledge
where
the
flitter
perched
just
as
they
had
seen
it
last
how
long
ago
that
had
been
they
could
not
have
told
but
they
suspected
that
days
of
haze
hung
in
between
vye
searched
the
sky
no
globes
winking
there
just
the
flyer
alone
he
took
his
old
seat
behind
the
pilot
watched
hume
test
the
relays
and
responses
in
the
quick
run
down
of
a
man
who
has
done
this
chore
many
times
before
but
the
other
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
when
he
finished
she
all
right
we
can
lift
again
they
both
looked
aloft
half
fearing
to
see
those
malignant
herders
wink
into
being
to
forbid
flight
but
the
sky
was
as
serenely
clear
of
even
a
drifting
cloud
as
they
could
hope
hume
pressed
a
button
and
they
arose
vertically
with
an
even
progress
totally
unlike
the
leap
which
had
taken
them
out
of
wass
camp
well
above
the
cliff
wall
they
hovered
and
were
able
to
see
below
the
round
bowl
of
the
valley
prison
hume
touched
controls
the
flitter
descended
slowly
just
above
the
center
of
the
lake
and
from
this
position
they
were
able
to
sight
the
other
peculiarity
of
that
body
of
water
that
it
was
perfectly
oval
in
shape
far
too
perfect
to
be
an
undeveloped
product
of
nature
hume
took
a
round
disk
from
his
equipment
belt
fitted
it
carefully
into
a
slot
on
the
control
board
and
pressed
the
button
below
then
he
sent
the
flitter
in
a
weaving
zigzag
course
well
above
the
surface
of
the
water
so
that
eventually
the
flyer
passed
over
every
foot
of
its
surface
and
from
above
in
spite
of
the
turgid
quality
of
the
liquid
they
could
see
what
did
rest
on
the
bottom
of
that
oval
the
wall
with
its
sharp
corner
which
vye
had
noted
from
shore
level
was
only
part
of
a
water
covered
erection
it
made
a
design
when
seen
from
overhead
a
star
surrounding
an
oval
and
in
the
midst
of
that
oval
a
black
blot
which
they
could
not
identify
hume
brought
the
flitter
over
in
one
last
sweep
that
it
we
have
a
full
taping
what
do
you
think
it
is
a
device
set
there
by
an
intelligent
being
and
set
a
long
time
ago
this
valley
was
arranged
over
night
six
months
ago
or
even
a
year
ago
we
have
to
let
the
experts
tell
us
when
and
for
what
reason
now
let
head
for
home
he
brought
the
flitter
up
and
over
the
valley
wall
flying
southwest
so
that
they
passed
over
the
gap
which
was
the
main
entrance
to
the
trap
and
now
he
tried
the
com
unit
endeavoring
to
pick
up
a
signal
on
which
they
could
beam
in
for
a
safe
ride
that
odd
under
hume
control
the
direction
finder
passed
back
and
forth
without
bringing
any
answering
code
click
from
the
mike
we
may
be
too
far
in
the
mountains
to
pick
up
the
beam
i
wonder
he
swept
the
needle
in
another
direction
slightly
to
the
left
a
crackle
spat
from
the
mike
vye
could
not
read
code
but
the
very
fury
and
intensity
of
that
sound
suggested
panic
even
terror
what
that
hume
spoke
without
looking
away
from
the
control
board
alarm
from
the
safari
no
wass
for
a
long
second
hume
sat
very
still
his
fingers
quiet
the
flitter
was
on
the
automatic
course
taking
them
out
of
the
mountains
and
vye
thought
that
their
air
speed
was
such
they
were
already
well
removed
from
that
sinister
valley
hume
made
a
slight
adjustment
to
a
dial
and
the
flitter
banked
coming
around
on
another
course
once
more
he
spun
the
finder
of
the
com
this
time
he
was
answered
with
a
series
of
clicks
which
lacked
the
urgency
of
that
other
call
hume
listened
until
the
code
rattled
into
silence
again
they
all
right
at
the
safari
camp
but
wass
is
in
trouble
so
what
does
that
matter
vye
wanted
to
know
it
matters
this
much
hume
spoke
slowly
as
if
he
must
convince
himself
as
well
as
vye
i
the
guild
man
on
jumala
and
the
guild
man
is
responsible
for
all
civs
you
ca
call
him
your
client
hume
shook
his
head
no
he
no
client
but
he
human
it
narrowed
down
to
that
when
a
man
was
on
the
frontier
worlds
humans
stood
together
vye
wanted
to
deny
it
but
his
own
emotions
as
well
as
the
centuries
of
tradition
argued
him
down
wass
was
a
veep
one
of
the
criminal
parasites
dabbling
in
human
misery
along
more
than
one
solar
lane
but
he
was
also
human
and
as
one
of
their
own
species
had
his
claim
on
them
vye
watched
hume
take
over
the
controls
felt
the
flitter
answer
another
change
of
course
then
heard
the
frantic
yammer
of
the
distress
call
as
they
leveled
off
to
ride
its
beam
in
to
the
hidden
camp
automatic
hume
had
turned
down
the
volume
of
the
receiver
so
that
the
clicks
in
the
mike
no
longer
were
so
strident
set
on
maximum
and
left
that
way
they
had
a
force
barrier
around
the
camp
and
they
knew
about
the
globes
and
the
watchers
vye
tried
to
imagine
what
had
happened
in
that
woods
clearing
the
barrier
might
have
shorted
and
without
the
flitter
they
would
have
been
pinned
could
have
taken
off
in
the
spacer
wass
does
have
the
reputation
of
letting
any
project
get
out
of
his
hands
vye
remembered
oh
your
billion
credit
deal
to
his
surprise
hume
laughed
seems
all
very
far
and
out
of
orbit
now
does
it
lansor
yes
our
billion
credit
deal
but
that
was
thought
out
before
we
knew
there
were
more
players
around
the
table
than
we
counted
i
wonder
but
what
he
wondered
he
did
not
put
into
words
and
a
moment
later
he
added
over
his
shoulder
better
try
to
get
some
rest
boy
we
some
time
to
a
vye
did
sleep
deeply
dreamlessly
and
he
roused
after
a
gentle
shaking
to
see
a
beam
of
light
in
the
sky
ahead
though
around
them
was
the
solid
darkness
of
night
that
a
warning
hume
explained
and
i
ca
raise
any
reply
from
the
camp
except
a
repeat
of
the
distress
call
if
there
is
anyone
there
now
he
ca
or
wo
answer
against
that
column
of
light
they
could
make
out
the
taper
of
the
spacer
and
the
landed
them
beside
that
ship
in
the
middle
of
an
area
well
lighted
by
the
steady
shaft
of
light
from
the
tripod
standing
where
the
atom
lamp
had
been
on
the
night
they
had
made
their
escape
from
camp
climbing
stiffly
from
the
small
flyer
they
advanced
with
caution
a
very
few
minutes
later
hume
slid
his
ray
tube
back
into
its
belt
loop
unless
they
holed
up
in
the
spacer
and
i
ca
see
why
they
do
that
this
camp
deserted
and
they
have
taken
any
equipment
with
them
except
maybe
a
few
items
they
could
the
ship
proved
as
empty
of
life
as
the
campsite
a
wall
seat
pulled
out
too
hastily
so
that
it
was
jammed
awry
the
com
cabin
suggested
that
the
when
and
for
what
reason
had
been
a
matter
of
some
emergency
hume
did
not
touch
the
tape
set
to
keep
on
broadcasting
the
call
for
assistance
what
now
vye
wanted
to
know
as
they
completed
the
search
the
safari
camp
first
and
a
call
for
the
patrol
look
here
vye
set
down
the
ration
container
he
had
found
was
emptying
it
with
vast
satisfaction
of
one
who
had
been
too
long
on
tablets
if
you
beam
the
patrol
you
have
to
talk
wo
you
hume
went
on
fitting
new
charges
into
his
ray
tube
the
patrol
has
to
have
a
full
report
there
no
way
of
bypassing
that
yes
we
have
to
give
all
the
story
you
need
worry
he
snapped
closed
the
load
chamber
i
can
clear
you
all
the
way
you
the
victim
remember
i
was
thinking
about
that
boy
hume
tossed
the
tube
up
in
the
air
caught
it
in
his
i
went
into
this
deal
with
my
eyes
wide
open
why
does
matter
very
much
now
in
fact
he
stared
beyond
vye
out
into
the
empty
lighted
camp
i
begun
to
wonder
about
a
lot
of
things
maybe
too
late
no
we
call
the
patrol
and
we
do
it
not
because
it
is
wass
and
his
men
out
there
but
because
we
human
and
they
human
and
there
a
nasty
here
which
has
already
sucked
in
other
humans
for
its
own
purposes
the
skeleton
in
the
valley
and
how
very
close
they
had
been
themselves
to
joining
that
unknown
in
his
permanent
residence
so
now
we
make
time
back
to
the
safari
camp
get
our
message
off
to
the
patrol
and
then
we
try
to
trace
wass
and
see
what
we
can
do
jumala
is
off
a
regular
route
the
patrol
wo
be
here
tomorrow
at
sunrise
no
matter
how
much
we
wish
a
scouter
would
planet
then
vye
was
quiet
as
he
stowed
in
the
flitter
again
as
hume
had
said
events
moved
fast
a
little
while
ago
he
had
wanted
to
settle
with
this
wring
out
of
him
not
only
an
explanation
for
his
being
here
but
claim
satisfaction
for
the
humiliation
of
being
moved
about
to
suit
some
others
purposes
now
he
was
willing
to
defeat
wass
bring
in
the
patrol
go
up
against
whatever
hid
in
that
lake
up
there
providing
hume
was
not
the
loser
he
tried
to
think
why
that
was
so
and
could
not
he
only
knew
it
was
the
truth
they
were
both
silent
as
they
took
off
from
wass
deserted
camp
sped
away
over
the
black
blot
of
the
woodland
towards
the
safari
headquarters
on
the
plains
there
were
stars
above
again
but
no
globes
just
as
they
had
won
their
freedom
from
the
valley
so
they
moved
without
escort
on
the
plains
but
the
lights
were
there
not
impinging
on
the
flitter
or
patrolling
along
its
line
of
flight
no
they
hung
in
a
glowing
cluster
ahead
when
in
the
dawn
the
flitter
shot
away
from
the
woods
headed
for
the
landmark
of
the
safari
camp
a
crown
of
lights
circled
over
the
camp
site
as
if
those
below
were
in
a
state
of
siege
hume
aimed
straight
for
them
and
this
time
the
bobbing
circle
split
wide
open
broke
to
left
and
right
vye
looked
below
though
the
grayness
of
the
morning
was
still
hardly
more
than
dusk
he
could
not
miss
those
humps
spaced
at
intervals
on
the
land
just
beyond
the
unseen
line
of
the
force
barrier
the
lights
above
the
beasts
below
the
safari
camp
was
under
guard
there
is
only
one
way
they
could
be
moving
toward
the
mountains
hume
stood
in
the
open
space
among
the
bubble
tents
facing
him
the
four
men
of
the
camp
the
three
civs
and
rovald
you
say
it
been
seven
days
planet
time
since
i
left
here
they
may
have
been
five
days
on
that
trail
if
possible
we
have
to
stop
them
before
they
reach
that
valley
a
fantastic
story
chambriss
wore
the
affronted
expression
of
a
man
who
expected
no
interference
with
his
own
concerns
then
catching
hume
eye
he
added
not
that
we
doubt
you
hunter
we
have
the
evidence
in
those
dumb
brutes
waiting
out
there
however
by
your
own
story
this
wass
is
an
veep
on
this
planet
secretly
for
criminal
purposes
surely
there
is
no
reason
for
us
to
risk
our
safety
in
his
behalf
are
you
certain
he
is
in
any
danger
at
all
you
and
this
young
man
here
have
by
your
testimony
been
into
the
enemies
territory
and
have
been
able
to
get
out
again
through
a
series
of
fortunate
chances
which
might
never
occur
again
hume
was
patient
too
patient
rovald
seemed
to
think
his
hand
moved
he
was
holding
a
ray
tube
so
that
a
simple
movement
of
the
wrist
could
send
a
crisping
blast
across
all
the
rest
of
the
party
i
say
stop
this
yapping
and
get
out
there
and
pick
up
the
veep
i
intend
to
after
i
call
the
patrol
rovald
tube
was
now
aimed
directly
at
hume
no
patrol
he
ordered
this
wrangling
has
gone
far
enough
it
was
yactisi
who
spoke
with
an
authority
which
startled
them
all
and
as
their
attention
swung
to
him
he
was
already
in
action
rovald
cried
out
the
weapon
spun
from
his
fingers
fingers
which
were
slowly
reddening
yactisi
nodded
with
satisfaction
and
he
held
his
electo
pole
ready
for
a
second
attack
vye
scooped
up
the
tube
which
had
whirled
across
the
ground
to
strike
against
his
borrowed
boot
i
set
the
call
for
the
patrol
then
i
try
to
locate
wass
hume
stated
sensible
procedure
yactisi
approved
in
his
dry
voice
you
believe
that
you
are
now
immune
to
whatever
force
this
alien
installation
controls
it
would
seem
so
then
of
course
you
must
go
why
chambriss
countered
for
the
second
time
suppose
he
is
so
immune
after
all
suppose
he
gets
out
there
and
is
captured
again
he
our
pilot
do
you
want
to
be
planet
bound
this
man
is
also
a
pilot
starns
indicated
rovald
who
was
nursing
his
numb
hand
since
he
too
is
one
of
these
criminals
he
not
to
be
trusted
chambriss
shot
back
hunter
i
demand
that
you
take
us
off
planet
at
once
and
it
is
only
fair
to
inform
you
that
i
also
intend
to
prefer
charges
against
you
and
against
the
guild
empty
world
just
how
empty
have
we
found
this
world
but
gentlehomo
starns
showed
no
signs
of
any
emotion
but
eager
curiosity
to
be
here
at
this
time
is
a
privilege
we
could
not
hope
to
equal
except
by
good
fortune
the
will
be
avid
for
our
stories
what
had
that
to
do
with
the
matter
puzzled
vye
but
he
saw
reminder
produce
a
quick
change
in
chambriss
the
he
repeated
his
expression
of
anger
smoothing
away
yes
of
course
this
is
in
a
manner
of
speaking
a
truly
historic
occasion
we
are
in
a
unique
position
had
yactisi
smiled
that
change
of
lip
line
had
been
so
slight
vye
could
not
call
it
a
smile
but
starns
appeared
to
have
found
the
right
way
to
handle
chambriss
and
it
was
the
same
little
man
who
offered
his
services
in
another
way
when
he
said
diffidently
to
hume
i
have
some
experience
with
coms
hunter
do
you
wish
me
to
send
your
message
and
take
over
the
unit
until
you
return
i
gather
he
added
with
a
certain
delicacy
that
it
will
not
be
expedient
for
your
gearman
to
engage
in
that
duty
now
so
it
was
that
starns
was
installed
in
the
com
cabin
of
the
spacer
sending
out
the
request
for
patrol
aid
while
rovald
was
locked
in
the
storage
compartment
of
the
same
ship
pending
arrival
of
those
same
authorities
as
hume
sorted
out
supplies
and
vye
loaded
them
into
the
waiting
flitter
yactisi
approached
the
hunter
you
have
a
definite
plan
of
search
just
to
cast
north
from
their
camp
if
they
been
gone
long
enough
to
hit
the
foothills
we
may
be
able
to
sight
them
climbing
otherwise
we
go
all
the
way
up
to
the
valley
wait
for
them
there
you
do
believe
that
they
will
be
released
after
they
have
been
processed
hume
shook
his
head
i
do
think
we
would
have
been
free
gentlehomo
if
it
had
been
for
a
series
of
fortunate
accidents
yes
though
you
did
give
us
many
details
about
that
hunter
hume
put
down
the
needler
he
had
been
charging
he
studied
yactisi
across
that
weapon
who
are
you
his
voice
was
soft
but
carried
a
snap
for
the
first
time
vye
saw
the
tall
lean
civ
really
smile
a
man
of
many
interests
hunter
shall
we
let
it
go
at
that
for
the
present
though
i
assure
you
that
wass
is
not
one
of
them
in
the
way
you
might
believe
gray
eyes
met
brown
held
so
straightly
then
hume
spoke
i
believe
you
but
i
have
told
you
the
truth
i
have
never
doubted
that
only
the
amount
of
it
there
must
be
more
talking
later
on
you
understand
that
i
never
thought
otherwise
hume
set
the
needler
inside
the
flitter
the
civ
smiled
again
this
time
including
vye
in
that
evidence
of
good
will
before
he
walked
away
hume
made
no
comment
that
does
it
he
told
his
companion
still
want
to
go
if
you
do
and
you
ca
do
it
alone
no
man
could
take
on
the
valley
and
wass
and
his
men
hume
made
no
comment
they
had
rested
briefly
after
their
return
to
the
safari
camp
and
vye
had
been
supplied
with
clothing
from
bags
so
that
now
he
wore
the
uniform
of
the
guild
he
went
armed
too
with
the
equipment
belt
taken
from
rovald
and
that
weapons
needler
and
tube
at
least
they
started
on
their
dubious
rescue
mission
with
every
aid
the
safari
camp
could
muster
it
was
when
the
flitter
took
to
the
air
once
again
scattering
the
hovering
globes
there
was
no
alteration
in
the
ranks
of
the
blue
watchers
waiting
for
the
barrier
to
go
down
or
someone
in
the
camp
to
step
beyond
that
protection
they
stupid
vye
said
not
stupid
just
geared
to
one
set
of
actions
hume
returned
which
could
mean
that
what
sends
them
here
ca
change
its
orders
good
guess
i
say
that
they
were
governed
by
something
akin
to
our
tapes
no
provision
made
for
any
innovations
so
the
guiding
intelligence
could
be
long
gone
i
think
it
has
been
hume
then
changed
the
subject
sharply
how
did
you
get
into
service
at
the
starfall
it
was
hard
now
to
think
back
to
nahuatl
as
if
the
vye
lansor
who
had
been
swamper
in
that
den
of
the
port
town
was
a
different
person
altogether
in
that
patch
of
memories
into
which
rynch
brodie
still
intruded
he
hunted
for
the
proper
answer
i
could
hold
the
state
jobs
and
once
you
get
the
habit
of
eating
you
do
starve
willingly
why
not
the
state
jobs
without
premium
they
all
tenders
places
i
tried
hard
enough
but
to
sit
pressing
buttons
when
a
light
flashed
hour
after
hour
vye
shook
his
head
they
said
i
was
too
erratic
and
gave
me
the
shove
one
more
move
on
and
it
would
have
been
compulsive
conditioning
i
turned
instead
ever
thought
of
trying
for
a
loan
premium
vye
laughed
shortly
loan
premium
that
a
true
fantasy
if
been
job
hopping
none
of
the
companies
will
take
a
chance
on
a
man
with
an
in
and
out
record
oh
i
tried
that
memory
arose
to
the
surface
clear
and
very
chilling
yes
he
had
tried
to
break
out
of
the
net
the
law
and
custom
had
put
around
him
from
the
day
he
had
been
made
a
state
child
no
it
was
conditioning
or
and
you
chose
i
was
still
me
as
long
as
i
stayed
away
from
conditioning
then
you
became
rynch
brodie
in
spite
of
your
flight
no
well
maybe
for
a
while
but
i
still
vye
lansor
here
yes
here
and
i
do
think
you
have
to
worry
about
raising
a
premium
to
get
a
new
start
you
can
claim
victim
compensation
you
know
vye
was
silent
but
hume
did
not
let
him
remain
so
when
the
patrol
arrives
you
put
in
your
claim
i
back
you
you
ca
that
where
you
mistaken
hume
told
him
crisply
i
already
taped
a
full
story
back
at
the
spacer
it
on
record
now
vye
frowned
the
hunter
seemed
determined
to
ask
for
the
worst
the
patrol
or
the
planet
police
back
on
nahuatl
could
deal
out
a
case
of
illegal
conditioning
was
about
as
serious
as
you
could
get
they
shot
along
the
diagonal
of
the
triangle
made
by
three
points
the
mountain
valley
wass
camp
and
the
safari
headquarters
heading
to
the
slopes
up
which
the
men
must
be
herded
if
the
beasts
were
shepherding
them
to
the
mountain
valley
vye
surveying
the
forest
thick
below
began
to
doubt
they
would
ever
be
able
to
pick
them
up
before
they
reached
the
valley
gate
hume
took
a
weaving
course
zigzagging
back
and
forth
while
they
both
watched
intently
for
a
glint
from
one
of
the
globes
any
movement
which
would
betray
that
trail
and
it
was
on
one
of
the
upper
slopes
that
the
flitter
passed
over
two
of
the
blue
beasts
lumbering
along
neither
of
the
creatures
paid
any
attention
to
the
flyer
they
moved
with
purpose
on
some
mission
of
their
own
maybe
the
tail
end
of
the
hunting
pack
hume
commented
he
sent
the
flyer
hovering
over
a
stunted
line
of
trees
and
brush
beyond
that
was
bare
rock
but
though
they
hung
for
moments
nothing
moved
into
that
open
wrong
scent
somehow
hume
brought
the
flitter
around
he
had
it
on
manual
control
now
keeping
it
answering
to
the
quick
changes
of
his
will
a
longer
sweep
supplied
the
answer
a
vegetation
roofed
slit
running
back
into
the
uplands
in
a
way
resembling
the
crevice
through
which
they
had
originally
found
their
way
into
this
country
hume
brought
the
flyer
along
that
but
if
the
men
they
sought
were
pushing
their
way
through
below
they
could
not
be
sighted
from
the
air
at
last
with
evening
drawing
in
hume
was
forced
to
admit
failure
wait
by
the
gap
vye
asked
have
to
now
hume
glanced
about
i
say
maybe
tomorrow
before
they
make
it
that
far
they
are
here
we
have
plenty
of
time
time
for
what
to
make
ready
for
a
pitched
battle
with
wass
or
with
the
beasts
herding
him
to
try
in
the
space
of
hours
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
lake
do
you
think
we
could
blast
that
thing
in
the
lake
vye
asked
we
might
be
able
to
just
might
but
that
must
be
the
last
resort
we
want
that
in
working
order
for
the
men
to
study
no
we
better
plan
to
hold
wass
at
the
gate
wait
for
the
patrol
to
come
in
less
than
an
hour
later
after
a
soaring
approach
hume
brought
the
flitter
down
with
neat
skill
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
cliffs
which
helped
to
form
the
portal
of
the
gap
there
was
no
difference
in
the
scene
below
save
that
where
the
two
bodies
of
the
blue
beasts
had
lain
there
were
now
only
clean
and
shining
bones
darkness
spread
out
from
the
lake
woods
like
a
growing
stain
of
evil
promise
as
the
sun
fell
behind
the
peaks
night
came
earlier
here
than
in
the
plains
watch
vye
had
been
gazing
down
the
gap
he
was
the
first
to
note
that
movement
in
the
cloaking
bush
out
of
the
cover
trotted
a
antlered
animal
he
had
not
seen
before
syken
deer
hume
identified
but
why
in
the
mountains
it
a
long
way
from
its
home
range
the
deer
did
not
pause
but
headed
directly
for
the
gap
and
as
it
neared
vye
saw
that
its
brown
coat
was
roughed
with
patches
of
white
froth
while
more
dripped
from
the
pale
pink
tongue
protruding
from
its
open
jaws
and
its
shrunken
sides
heaved
driven
hume
picked
up
a
stone
hurled
it
to
strike
the
ground
ahead
of
the
deer
the
creature
did
not
start
nor
show
any
sign
of
seeing
the
rock
fall
it
trotted
on
at
the
same
wearied
pace
passed
the
portal
rocks
into
the
valley
then
it
stood
still
head
up
black
horns
displayed
while
the
nose
flaps
expanded
testing
the
air
until
it
bounded
toward
the
lake
disappearing
in
the
woods
though
they
shared
watches
during
the
night
there
were
no
other
signs
of
life
nor
did
the
deer
reappear
from
the
woods
with
the
there
was
a
sudden
sound
to
warn
them
a
wild
cry
which
must
have
come
from
a
human
throat
hume
tossed
one
of
the
needlers
to
vye
took
the
other
and
they
scrambled
down
to
the
floor
of
the
gap
passage
wass
did
not
lead
his
men
he
came
behind
the
reeling
trio
as
if
he
had
joined
the
blasts
as
driver
and
while
his
men
wavered
staggered
gave
the
appearance
of
nearly
complete
exhaustion
he
still
walked
with
a
steady
tread
in
command
of
his
wits
his
fears
and
the
company
as
the
first
of
the
men
blundered
on
a
fresh
trickle
of
red
running
down
his
bruised
face
hume
called
wass
the
veep
stopped
short
he
made
no
move
to
unsling
the
needler
he
carried
its
barrel
pointing
skyward
over
his
shoulder
but
his
round
head
with
its
upstanding
comb
of
hair
swung
slightly
from
side
to
side
stop
wass
this
is
a
trap
his
three
men
kept
on
vye
moved
for
peake
leading
that
wavering
group
stumbled
would
have
fallen
had
not
the
younger
man
advanced
from
the
shadows
to
steady
him
vye
hume
made
his
name
a
warning
he
had
only
time
to
glance
around
wass
his
broad
face
impassive
except
for
the
eyes
those
burning
madman
eyes
was
aiming
a
ray
tube
broken
free
of
his
hold
peake
fell
to
the
right
came
up
against
hume
as
vye
went
down
he
saw
wass
dart
forward
at
a
speed
he
have
believed
a
driven
man
could
summon
the
veep
lunged
escaping
the
shot
the
hunter
had
no
time
to
aim
rolled
and
came
up
with
the
needler
vye
had
dropped
then
hume
hampered
by
peake
feeble
clawing
met
head
on
the
swinging
barrel
of
that
weapon
he
gave
a
startled
grunt
and
smashed
back
against
the
cliff
a
wave
of
scarlet
blood
streaming
down
the
side
of
his
head
the
momentum
of
wass
charge
carried
him
on
he
collided
with
his
men
and
the
last
thing
vye
saw
was
the
huddle
of
all
four
of
them
flailing
arms
and
legs
spinning
on
through
the
gate
into
the
valley
with
wass
hoarse
wordless
shouting
bringing
echoes
from
the
cliffs
he
lay
against
a
rock
and
it
was
quiet
again
except
for
a
small
whimpering
sound
which
hurt
joined
with
the
eating
pain
in
his
side
vye
turned
his
head
smelled
burned
cloth
and
flesh
cautiously
he
tried
to
move
bring
his
hand
across
his
body
to
the
belt
at
his
waist
one
small
part
of
his
mind
was
very
clear
if
he
could
get
his
fingers
to
the
packet
there
and
the
contents
of
that
packet
to
his
mouth
the
pain
would
go
away
and
maybe
he
could
slip
back
into
the
darkness
again
somehow
he
did
it
pulled
the
packet
out
of
its
container
pouch
worked
the
fingers
of
his
one
usable
hand
until
he
shredded
open
the
end
of
the
covering
the
tablets
inside
spilled
out
but
he
had
three
or
four
of
them
in
his
grasp
laboriously
he
brought
his
hand
up
mouthed
them
all
together
chewing
their
bitterness
swallowing
them
as
best
he
could
without
water
water
the
lake
for
a
moment
he
was
back
in
time
feeling
for
the
water
bulbs
he
should
be
carrying
then
the
incautious
movement
of
his
questing
fingers
brought
a
sudden
stab
of
raw
red
agony
and
he
moaned
the
tablets
worked
but
he
did
not
slide
back
into
unconsciousness
again
as
the
throbbing
torture
became
something
remote
and
untroubling
with
his
good
arm
he
braced
himself
against
the
cliff
managed
to
sit
up
sun
flashed
on
the
metal
barrel
of
a
needler
which
lay
in
the
trampled
dust
between
him
and
another
figure
still
very
still
with
a
pool
of
blood
about
the
head
vye
waited
for
a
steadying
breath
or
two
then
started
the
infinitely
long
journey
of
several
feet
which
separated
him
from
hume
he
was
panting
heavily
when
he
crawled
close
enough
to
touch
the
hunter
hume
face
cheek
down
in
the
now
sodden
dust
was
dabbled
with
congealing
blood
as
vye
turned
the
hunter
head
it
rolled
limply
the
other
side
was
a
mass
of
blood
and
dust
too
thick
to
afford
vye
any
idea
of
how
serious
a
hurt
hume
had
taken
but
he
was
still
alive
with
his
good
hand
vye
thrust
his
numb
and
useless
left
one
into
the
front
of
his
belt
then
awkwardly
he
tried
to
tend
hume
after
a
close
inspection
he
thought
that
the
mass
of
blood
had
come
from
a
ragged
tear
in
the
scalp
above
the
temple
and
the
bone
beneath
had
escaped
damage
from
hume
own
pack
he
crushed
tablets
into
the
other
slack
mouth
hoping
they
would
dissolve
if
the
hunter
could
not
swallow
then
he
relaxed
against
the
cliff
to
wait
for
what
he
could
not
have
said
wass
party
had
gone
on
into
the
valley
when
vye
turned
his
head
to
look
down
the
slope
he
could
see
nothing
of
them
they
must
have
tried
to
push
on
to
the
lake
the
flitter
was
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
as
far
out
of
his
reach
now
as
if
it
were
in
planetary
orbit
there
was
only
the
hope
that
a
rescue
party
from
the
safari
camp
might
come
hume
had
set
the
directional
beam
on
the
flyer
when
he
had
brought
her
down
to
serve
as
a
beacon
for
the
patrol
if
and
when
starns
was
lucky
enough
to
contact
a
cruiser
hmmm
hume
mouth
moved
cracked
the
drying
bloody
mask
on
his
lips
and
chin
his
eyes
blinked
open
and
he
lay
staring
up
at
the
sky
hume
vye
was
startled
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
so
thready
and
weak
and
by
the
fact
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
at
all
the
other
head
turned
now
the
eyes
were
on
him
and
there
was
a
spark
of
awareness
in
them
wass
the
whisper
was
as
strained
as
his
own
had
been
in
there
vye
hand
lifted
from
hume
chest
indicating
the
valley
not
good
hume
blinked
again
how
bad
his
attention
was
not
for
his
own
hurt
his
eyes
searched
vye
and
the
latter
glanced
down
at
his
side
by
some
chance
perhaps
because
of
his
struggle
with
peake
wass
beam
had
not
struck
true
the
main
core
of
the
bolt
passing
between
his
arm
and
his
side
burning
both
how
deeply
he
could
not
tell
in
fact
he
did
not
want
to
find
out
it
was
enough
that
the
tablets
had
banished
the
pain
now
seared
a
little
he
said
you
a
bad
cut
on
your
head
hume
frowned
can
we
make
the
flitter
vye
moved
then
relaxed
quickly
into
his
former
position
not
now
he
evaded
knowing
that
neither
of
them
would
be
able
to
take
that
climb
beam
on
hume
repeated
vye
thoughts
of
moments
before
patrol
coming
yes
eventually
the
patrol
would
come
but
when
hours
days
time
was
their
enemy
now
he
did
not
have
to
say
any
of
that
they
both
knew
needler
hume
head
had
turned
in
the
other
direction
now
his
hand
pointed
waveringly
to
the
weapon
in
the
dust
they
wo
be
back
vye
stated
the
obvious
those
others
had
been
caught
in
the
trap
the
odds
on
their
return
without
aid
were
very
high
needler
hume
repeated
more
firmly
and
tried
to
sit
up
falling
back
with
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
vye
edged
around
stretched
out
his
leg
and
scraped
the
toe
of
his
boot
into
the
loop
of
the
carrying
sling
drawing
the
weapon
up
to
where
he
could
get
his
hand
on
it
as
he
steadied
it
across
his
knee
hume
spoke
again
watch
for
trouble
they
all
went
in
vye
protested
but
hume
eyes
had
closed
again
trouble
maybe
his
voice
trailed
off
vye
rested
his
hand
on
the
stock
of
the
needler
hoooooo
that
beast
wail
as
they
had
heard
it
in
the
valley
somewhere
from
the
wood
vye
brought
the
needler
around
so
that
the
sights
pointed
in
that
direction
there
death
might
be
hunting
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
a
scream
filled
with
all
the
agony
of
a
man
in
torment
caught
up
on
the
echoes
of
that
other
cry
vye
sighted
a
wild
waving
of
bushes
a
figure
very
small
and
far
away
crawled
into
the
open
on
hands
and
knees
and
then
crumpled
into
only
a
shadowy
blot
on
the
moss
again
the
beast
cry
and
a
shouting
vye
watched
a
second
man
back
out
of
the
trees
still
facing
whatever
pursued
him
he
caught
the
glint
of
sun
on
what
must
be
a
ray
tube
leaves
crisped
into
a
black
hole
curls
of
smoke
arose
along
the
path
of
that
blast
the
man
kept
on
backing
passed
the
inert
body
of
his
companion
glancing
now
and
then
over
his
shoulder
at
the
slope
up
which
he
was
making
a
slow
but
steady
way
he
no
longer
rayed
the
bush
but
there
was
the
crackle
of
a
small
fire
outlining
the
ragged
hole
his
beam
had
cut
back
two
strides
three
then
he
turned
made
a
quick
dash
again
facing
around
after
he
had
gained
some
yards
in
the
open
vye
saw
now
it
was
wass
another
dash
and
an
about
face
but
this
time
to
confront
the
enemy
there
were
three
of
them
as
monstrous
as
those
vye
and
hume
had
fought
in
the
same
place
and
one
of
them
was
wounded
swinging
a
charred
forepaw
before
it
and
giving
voice
to
a
wild
frenzy
of
roars
wass
leveled
the
ray
tube
centered
sights
on
the
beast
nearest
to
him
the
man
hammered
at
the
firing
button
with
the
flat
of
his
other
hand
and
almost
paid
for
that
second
of
distraction
with
his
life
for
the
creature
made
one
of
those
lightning
swift
dashes
vye
had
so
luckily
escaped
the
clawed
forepaw
tore
a
strip
from
the
shoulder
of
wass
tunic
left
sprouting
red
furrows
behind
but
the
man
had
thrown
the
useless
tube
into
its
face
was
now
running
for
the
gap
vye
held
the
needler
braced
against
his
knee
to
fire
he
saw
the
dart
quiver
in
the
upper
arm
of
the
beast
and
it
halted
to
pull
out
that
sliver
of
dangerously
poisoned
metal
crumpled
it
into
a
tight
twist
vye
continued
to
fire
never
sure
of
his
aim
but
seeing
those
slivers
go
home
in
thick
legs
in
outstretched
forelimbs
in
wide
pendulous
bellies
then
there
were
three
blue
shapes
lying
on
the
slope
behind
the
man
running
straight
for
the
gap
wass
hit
the
invisible
barrier
full
force
was
hurled
back
to
lie
gasping
on
the
turf
but
already
raising
himself
to
crawl
again
to
the
gateway
he
saw
and
could
not
believe
was
barred
vye
closed
his
eyes
he
was
very
tired
now
tired
and
sleepy
maybe
the
pain
pills
were
bringing
the
secondary
form
of
relief
but
he
could
hear
just
beyond
the
man
who
beat
at
that
unseen
curtain
first
in
anger
and
fear
and
then
just
in
fear
until
the
fear
was
a
lonesome
crying
that
went
on
and
on
until
even
that
last
feeble
assault
on
the
barrier
failed
we
have
here
the
tape
report
of
ras
hume
of
the
guild
vye
watched
the
officer
in
the
black
and
silver
of
the
patrol
a
black
and
silver
modified
with
the
small
green
eye
badge
of
with
level
and
hostile
gaze
then
you
know
the
story
he
was
going
to
make
no
additions
nor
explanations
maybe
hume
had
cleared
him
all
right
that
was
all
he
would
ask
to
be
free
to
go
his
way
and
forget
about
jumala
and
ras
hume
he
had
not
seen
the
hunter
since
they
had
both
been
loaded
into
the
patrol
flitter
in
the
gap
wass
had
come
out
of
the
valley
a
witless
dazed
creature
still
under
the
mental
influence
of
whoever
or
whatever
had
set
that
trap
as
far
as
vye
knew
the
veep
had
not
yet
recovered
his
full
senses
he
might
never
do
so
and
if
hume
had
not
dictated
that
confession
to
damn
himself
before
the
patrol
he
might
have
escaped
they
could
suspect
but
they
would
have
had
no
proof
you
continue
to
refuse
to
tape
the
officer
favored
him
with
one
of
the
looks
vye
had
often
seen
on
the
face
of
authority
i
have
my
rights
you
have
the
right
to
claim
victim
compensation
a
good
compensation
lansor
vye
shrugged
and
then
winced
at
a
warning
from
the
tender
skin
over
ribs
i
make
no
claim
and
no
tape
he
repeated
and
he
intended
to
go
on
saying
that
as
long
as
they
asked
him
this
was
the
second
visit
in
two
days
and
he
was
getting
a
little
tired
of
it
all
perhaps
he
should
do
as
prudence
dictated
and
demand
to
be
returned
to
nahuatl
only
his
odd
unexplainable
desire
to
at
least
see
hume
kept
him
from
making
the
request
they
would
have
to
honor
you
had
better
reconsider
authority
resumed
rights
of
person
vye
almost
grinned
as
he
recited
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
could
use
that
particular
phrase
and
make
it
stick
he
thought
there
was
a
sour
twist
to
the
officer
mouth
but
the
other
still
retained
his
impersonal
tone
as
he
spoke
into
the
intership
com
he
refused
to
make
a
tape
vye
waited
for
the
other
next
move
this
should
mark
the
end
of
their
interview
but
instead
the
officer
appeared
to
relax
the
restraint
of
his
official
manner
he
brought
a
case
from
an
inner
pocket
offered
a
choice
of
contents
to
vye
who
gave
an
instant
and
suspicious
refusal
by
shake
of
head
the
officer
selected
one
of
the
small
tubes
snapped
off
the
and
set
it
between
his
lips
for
a
satisfying
and
lengthy
pull
then
the
panel
of
the
cabin
door
pushed
open
and
vye
sat
up
with
a
jerk
as
ras
hume
his
head
banded
with
a
covering
entered
the
officer
waved
his
hand
at
vye
with
the
air
of
one
turning
over
a
problem
you
were
entirely
right
and
he
all
yours
hume
vye
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
hume
tape
in
official
hands
why
was
the
hunter
under
restraint
unless
because
they
were
aboard
the
patrol
cruiser
the
officers
did
think
a
closer
confinement
was
necessary
yet
the
hunter
was
acting
the
role
of
prisoner
very
well
in
fact
he
perched
on
a
seat
with
the
ease
of
one
completely
at
home
accepted
the
vye
had
refused
so
you
wo
make
a
tape
he
asked
cheerfully
you
act
as
if
you
want
me
to
vye
was
so
completely
baffled
by
this
odd
turn
of
action
that
his
voice
came
out
almost
plaintively
seeing
as
how
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
went
into
placing
you
in
the
position
where
you
give
us
that
tape
i
must
admit
some
disappointment
give
vye
echoed
the
officer
removed
the
from
between
his
lips
tell
him
the
whole
sad
story
hume
but
vye
began
to
guess
life
in
the
starfall
or
as
either
sharpened
the
wits
or
deadened
them
vye
had
suffered
the
burnishing
process
a
a
hume
agreed
then
he
glanced
at
the
patrol
officer
a
little
defensively
i
might
as
well
tell
the
whole
truth
this
did
quite
begin
on
the
right
side
of
the
law
i
had
my
reasons
for
wanting
to
make
trouble
for
the
kogan
estate
only
not
because
of
the
credits
involved
he
moved
his
hand
when
i
found
that
from
the
largo
drift
and
saw
the
possibilities
did
a
little
day
dreaming
i
worked
out
this
scheme
but
i
a
guild
man
and
as
it
happens
i
want
to
stay
one
so
i
reported
to
one
of
the
masters
and
told
him
the
whole
story
why
i
had
taped
on
the
records
my
discovery
on
jumala
when
he
passed
along
the
news
of
the
to
the
patrol
he
also
suggested
that
there
might
be
room
for
fraud
along
the
way
i
had
thought
it
out
that
started
a
chain
reaction
it
happened
that
the
patrol
wanted
wass
but
he
was
too
big
and
slick
to
be
caught
in
a
case
which
could
be
broken
in
court
they
thought
that
here
was
just
the
bait
he
might
snap
at
and
i
was
the
one
to
offer
it
to
him
he
could
check
on
me
learn
that
i
had
excellent
reason
to
do
what
i
said
i
was
doing
so
i
went
to
him
with
my
story
and
he
liked
it
we
made
the
plan
work
just
as
i
had
outlined
it
and
he
planted
rovald
on
me
as
a
check
but
i
did
know
yactisi
was
a
plant
also
the
patrol
officer
smiled
insurance
he
waved
the
just
insurance
what
we
did
foresee
was
this
complicating
alien
trouble
you
were
to
be
collected
as
the
castaway
brought
back
to
the
center
and
then
once
wass
was
firmly
enmeshed
the
patrol
would
blow
the
thing
wide
open
now
we
do
have
wass
with
your
tape
we
have
him
for
good
subject
to
complete
reconditioning
but
we
also
have
an
puzzle
which
will
keep
the
services
busy
for
some
time
and
we
would
like
your
tape
vye
watched
hume
narrowly
then
you
an
agent
hume
shook
his
head
no
just
what
i
said
i
am
an
who
happened
to
come
into
some
knowledge
that
will
assist
in
straightening
out
a
few
crooked
quirks
in
several
systems
i
have
no
love
for
the
kogan
clan
but
to
help
bring
down
a
veep
of
wass
measure
does
aid
in
reinstating
one
this
victim
compensation
i
claim
it
even
though
the
deal
was
a
you
have
first
call
on
wass
assets
he
has
plenty
invested
in
legitimate
enterprises
though
we
probably
never
locate
all
his
hidden
funds
but
everything
we
can
get
open
title
to
will
be
impounded
have
something
to
do
with
your
share
inquired
the
officer
yes
hume
was
smiling
subtly
he
was
a
different
man
from
the
one
vye
had
known
on
jumala
premium
for
the
guild
is
one
thousand
credits
down
two
thousand
for
training
and
say
another
for
about
the
best
field
outfit
you
can
buy
that
give
you
maybe
another
two
or
three
thousand
to
save
for
your
honorable
retirement
how
did
you
know
vye
began
and
then
had
to
laugh
in
spite
of
himself
as
hume
replied
i
did
good
guess
eh
well
zoom
out
your
recorder
commander
i
think
you
are
going
to
have
some
very
free
speech
now
he
got
to
his
feet
you
know
the
guild
has
a
stake
in
this
alien
discovery
we
may
just
find
that
we
have
seen
the
last
of
that
valley
after
all

was
gone
