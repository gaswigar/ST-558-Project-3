stephen

my
grandfather
was
a
publican
and
a
sinner
as
you
will
see
his
was
the
hole
in
the
wall
on
the
river
edge
at
wapping
and
his
sins
all
of
them
that
i
know
of
are
recorded
in
these
pages
he
was
a
widower
of
some
small
substance
and
the
hole
in
the
wall
was
not
the
sum
of
his
resources
for
he
owned
a
little
wharf
on
the
river
lea
i
called
him
grandfather
nat
not
to
distinguish
him
among
a
multitude
of
grandfathers
for
indeed
i
never
knew
another
of
my
own
but
because
of
affectionate
habit
a
habit
perhaps
born
of
the
fact
that
nathaniel
kemp
was
also
my
father
name
my
own
is
stephen
to
remember
grandfather
nat
is
to
bethink
me
of
it
is
possible
that
that
particular
sort
of
sweetstuff
is
now
obsolete
and
i
can
not
remember
how
many
years
have
passed
since
last
i
smelt
it
for
the
was
a
thing
that
could
be
smelt
farther
than
seen
and
oftener
so
that
its
smell
a
rather
fulsome
vulgar
smell
i
now
believe
is
almost
as
distinct
to
my
imagination
while
i
write
as
it
was
to
my
nose
thirty
years
ago
for
were
an
unfailing
part
of
the
large
bagful
of
sticky
lollipops
that
my
grandfather
brought
on
his
visits
stuffed
into
his
overcoat
pocket
and
hard
to
get
out
without
a
burst
and
a
spill
his
custom
was
invariable
so
that
i
think
i
must
have
come
to
regard
the
sweets
as
some
natural
production
of
his
coat
pocket
insomuch
that
at
my
mother
funeral
my
muddled
brain
scarce
realised
the
full
desolation
of
the
circumstances
till
i
discovered
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
experience
my
pocket
was
void
of
but
with
this
new
bereavement
the
world
seemed
empty
indeed
and
i
cried
afresh
associated
in
my
memory
with
my
grandfather
bag
of
sweets
almost
more
than
with
himself
was
the
gap
in
the
right
hand
where
the
middle
finger
had
been
for
it
was
commonly
the
maimed
hand
that
hauled
out
the
paper
bag
and
the
gap
was
plain
and
singular
against
the
white
paper
he
had
lost
the
finger
at
sea
they
told
me
and
as
my
notion
of
losing
a
thing
was
derived
from
my
noah
ark
or
dropping
a
marble
through
a
grating
i
was
long
puzzled
to
guess
how
anything
like
that
could
have
happened
to
a
finger
withal
the
circumstance
fascinated
me
and
added
vastly
to
the
importance
and
the
wonder
of
my
grandfather
in
my
childish
eyes
he
was
perhaps
a
little
over
the
middle
height
but
so
broad
and
so
deep
of
chest
and
especially
so
long
of
arm
as
to
seem
squat
he
had
some
grey
hair
but
it
was
all
below
the
line
of
his
above
that
it
was
as
the
hair
of
a
young
man
so
that
i
was
led
to
reason
that
colour
must
be
washed
out
of
hair
by
exposure
to
the
weather
as
perhaps
in
his
case
it
was
i
think
that
his
face
was
almost
handsome
in
a
rough
way
and
he
was
as
hairy
a
man
as
i
ever
saw
his
short
beard
was
like
curled
wire
but
i
can
remember
that
long
after
i
had
grown
to
resent
being
kissed
by
women
being
no
longer
a
baby
i
gladly
climbed
his
knee
to
kiss
my
grandfather
though
his
shaven
was
like
a
rasp
in
these
early
days
i
lived
with
my
mother
in
a
little
house
of
a
short
row
that
stood
on
a
quay
in
a
place
that
was
not
exactly
a
dock
nor
a
wharf
nor
a
public
thoroughfare
but
where
people
from
the
dock
trying
to
find
a
wharf
people
from
a
wharf
looking
for
the
dock
and
people
from
the
public
thoroughfare
in
anxious
search
of
dock
and
wharves
used
to
meet
and
ask
each
other
questions
it
was
a
detached
piece
of
blackwall
which
had
got
adrift
among
locks
and
jetties
and
was
liable
to
be
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
at
any
moment
by
the
arrival
of
a
ship
and
the
consequent
swinging
of
a
bridge
worked
by
two
men
at
a
winch
so
that
it
was
a
commonplace
of
my
early
childhood
though
the
sight
never
lost
its
interest
to
observe
from
a
window
a
ship
passing
as
it
were
up
the
street
warped
into
dock
by
the
capstans
on
the
quay
and
the
of
the
dockmen
is
covered
with
for
the
black
ball
and
the
like
were
as
much
my
nursery
rhymes
as
boy
and
a
song
o
these
things
are
done
differently
nowadays
the
cottages
on
the
quay
are
gone
and
the
neighbourhood
is
a
smokier
place
where
the
work
is
done
by
engines
with
no
songs
my
father
was
so
much
at
sea
that
i
remember
little
of
him
at
all
he
was
a
ship
officer
and
at
the
time
i
am
to
tell
of
he
was
mate
of
the
brig
owned
by
viney
and
marr
one
of
the
small
shipowning
firms
that
were
common
enough
thirty
years
ago
though
rarer
now
the
sort
of
firm
that
was
made
by
a
pushing
skipper
and
an
ambitious
shipping
clerk
beginning
with
a
cheap
vessel
bought
with
money
raised
mainly
by
pawning
the
ship
such
concerns
often
did
well
and
sometimes
grew
into
great
lines
perhaps
most
of
them
yielded
the
partners
no
more
than
a
comfortable
subsistence
and
a
good
few
came
to
grief
or
were
kept
going
by
questionable
practices
which
have
since
become
illegal
sometimes
in
truth
by
what
the
law
called
crime
even
then
viney
had
been
a
ship
officer
had
indeed
served
under
grandfather
nat
who
was
an
old
skipper
marr
was
the
business
man
who
had
been
a
clerk
and
the
firm
owned
two
brigs
the
and
another
though
how
much
of
their
value
was
clear
property
and
how
much
stood
for
borrowed
money
was
matter
of
doubt
and
disagreement
in
the
conversation
of
mates
and
skippers
along
thames
shore
what
nobody
disagreed
about
however
was
that
the
business
was
run
on
skinflint
principles
and
that
the
vessels
were
so
badly
found
so
and
so
grievously
that
the
firm
ought
to
be
making
money
these
things
by
the
way
though
they
are
important
to
remember
as
i
was
saying
i
remember
little
of
my
father
because
of
his
long
voyages
and
short
spells
at
home
but
my
mother
is
so
clear
and
so
kind
in
my
recollection
that
sometimes
i
dream
of
her
still
though
she
died
before
i
was
eight
it
was
while
my
father
was
on
a
long
voyage
with
the
that
there
came
a
time
when
she
took
me
often
upon
her
knee
asking
if
i
should
like
a
little
brother
or
sister
to
play
with
a
thing
which
i
demanded
to
have
brought
instantly
there
was
a
fat
woman
called
dann
who
appeared
in
the
household
and
became
my
enemy
she
slept
with
my
mother
and
my
cot
was
thrust
into
another
room
where
i
lay
at
night
and
brooded
sometimes
wept
with
jealousy
thus
to
be
supplanted
though
i
drew
what
consolation
i
might
from
the
prospect
of
the
promised
playmate
then
i
could
not
go
near
my
mother
at
all
for
she
was
ill
and
there
was
a
doctor
and
then
i
was
told
that
mother
and
were
gone
to
heaven
together
a
thing
i
would
not
hear
of
but
fought
savagely
with
dann
on
the
landing
shouting
to
my
mother
that
she
was
not
to
die
for
i
was
coming
and
when
wearied
with
kicking
and
screaming
for
i
fought
with
neighbours
as
well
as
with
the
nurse
and
the
undertaker
conceiving
them
to
be
all
in
league
to
deprive
me
of
my
mother
when
at
last
the
woman
from
next
door
took
me
into
the
bedroom
and
i
saw
the
drawn
face
that
could
not
smile
and
my
tiny
brother
that
could
not
play
lying
across
the
dead
breast
i
so
behaved
that
the
good
soul
with
me
blubbered
aloud
and
i
had
an
added
grief
in
the
reflection
that
i
had
kicked
her
shins
not
half
an
hour
before
i
have
never
seen
that
good
woman
since
and
i
am
ashamed
to
write
that
i
can
not
even
remember
her
name
i
have
no
more
to
say
of
my
mother
and
of
her
funeral
only
so
much
as
records
the
least
part
of
my
grief
some
of
her
relations
came
whom
i
can
not
distinctly
remember
seeing
at
any
other
time
a
group
of
elderly
and
women
who
talked
of
me
as
the
child
very
much
as
they
might
have
talked
of
some
troublesome
article
of
baggage
and
who
turned
up
their
noses
at
my
grandfather
who
for
his
part
was
uneasily
respectful
calling
each
of
them
mum
very
often
i
was
not
attracted
by
my
mother
relations
and
i
kept
as
near
my
grandfather
as
possible
feeling
a
vague
fear
that
some
of
them
might
have
a
design
of
taking
me
away
though
indeed
none
was
in
the
least
ambitious
of
that
responsibility
they
were
not
all
women
for
there
was
one
quiet
little
man
in
their
midst
who
when
not
eating
cake
or
drinking
wine
was
sucking
the
bone
handle
of
a
woman
umbrella
which
he
carried
with
him
everywhere
indoors
and
out
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
largest
and
grimmest
of
ladies
whom
the
others
called
aunt
martha
he
was
so
completely
in
her
custody
that
after
some
consideration
i
judged
he
must
be
her
son
though
indeed
he
seemed
very
old
for
that
i
now
believe
him
to
have
been
her
husband
but
i
can
not
remember
to
have
heard
his
name
and
i
can
not
invent
him
a
better
one
than
uncle
martha
uncle
martha
would
have
behaved
quite
well
i
am
convinced
if
he
had
been
left
alone
and
would
have
acquitted
himself
with
perfect
propriety
in
all
the
transactions
of
the
day
but
it
seemed
to
be
aunt
immovable
belief
that
he
was
wholly
incapable
of
any
action
even
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
unless
impelled
by
shoves
and
jerks
consequently
he
was
shoved
into
the
mourning
carriage
we
had
two
and
jerked
into
the
corner
opposite
to
the
one
he
selected
shoved
out
almost
on
all
fours
at
the
cemetery
and
perceiving
him
entering
the
little
chapel
of
his
own
motion
aunt
martha
overtook
him
and
jerked
him
in
there
this
example
presently
impressed
the
other
ladies
with
the
expediency
of
shoving
uncle
martha
at
any
convenient
opportunity
so
that
he
arrived
home
with
us
at
last
in
a
severely
jostled
condition
faithful
to
the
umbrella
through
everything
grandfather
nat
had
been
liberal
in
provision
for
the
funeral
party
and
the
cake
and
port
wine
the
gin
and
water
the
tea
and
the
watercress
occupied
the
visitors
for
some
time
a
period
illuminated
by
many
moral
reflections
from
a
rather
fat
relation
who
was
no
doubt
like
most
of
the
others
an
aunt
ah
well
said
the
fat
aunt
shaking
her
head
with
a
deep
sigh
that
suggested
repletion
ah
well
it
what
we
must
all
come
to
there
had
been
a
deal
of
other
conversation
but
i
remember
this
remark
because
the
fat
aunt
had
already
made
it
twice
ah
indeed
assented
another
aunt
a
thin
one
so
we
must
sooner
or
later
yes
yes
as
i
often
say
we
all
mortal
yes
indeed
we
all
got
to
be
born
an
we
all
got
to
die
that
true
rich
an
poor
just
the
same
ah
in
the
midst
of
life
we
in
the
middle
of
it
ah
yes
grandfather
nat
deeply
impressed
made
haste
to
refill
the
fat
glass
and
to
push
the
nearer
aunt
martha
jerked
uncle
martha
elbow
toward
his
glass
which
he
was
neglecting
with
a
sudden
nod
and
a
frown
of
pointed
significance
even
command
it
a
great
trial
for
all
of
the
family
i
sure
pursued
the
fat
aunt
after
applications
to
glass
and
but
we
must
bear
up
not
that
we
ai
had
trials
enough
neither
no
indeed
replied
aunt
martha
with
a
snap
at
my
grandfather
as
though
he
were
the
trial
chiefly
on
her
mind
which
grandfather
nat
took
very
humbly
and
tried
her
with
watercress
well
she
better
off
poor
thing
the
fat
aunt
went
on
some
began
to
say
ah
again
but
aunt
martha
snapped
it
into
well
let
hope
so
in
the
tone
of
one
convinced
that
my
mother
could
be
much
worse
off
than
she
had
been
from
which
and
from
sundry
other
remarks
among
the
aunts
i
gathered
that
my
mother
was
held
to
have
hurt
the
dignity
of
her
family
by
alliance
with
grandfather
nat
i
have
never
wholly
understood
why
but
i
put
the
family
pride
down
to
the
traditional
wedding
of
an
undoubted
auctioneer
with
aunt
cousin
so
aunt
martha
said
let
hope
so
and
with
another
sudden
frown
and
nod
shoved
uncle
martha
toward
the
cake
what
a
blessing
the
child
was
took
too
was
the
fat
aunt
next
observation
ah
that
it
is
murmured
the
chorus
but
i
was
puzzled
and
shocked
to
hear
such
a
thing
said
of
my
little
brother
and
it
a
good
job
there
only
one
left
the
chorus
agreed
again
i
began
to
feel
that
i
had
seriously
disobliged
my
mother
relations
by
not
dying
too
and
him
a
boy
boys
can
look
after
themselves
this
was
a
thin
opinion
ah
and
that
a
blessing
sighed
the
fat
aunt
a
great
blessing
of
course
said
aunt
martha
and
it
not
to
be
expected
that
his
mother
relations
can
be
burdened
with
him
why
no
indeed
said
the
fat
aunt
very
decisively
i
sure
it
would
be
poor
ellen
wish
to
cause
more
trouble
to
her
family
than
she
has
and
aunt
martha
with
a
frown
at
the
watercress
gave
uncle
martha
another
jolt
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
had
really
eaten
all
he
wanted
and
would
rather
leave
off
and
i
wondered
if
she
always
fed
him
like
that
or
if
it
were
only
when
they
were
visiting
and
besides
it
be
standing
in
the
child
way
aunt
martha
resumed
with
so
many
openings
as
there
is
in
the
docks
here
quite
handy
perhaps
it
was
because
i
was
rather
dull
in
the
head
that
day
from
one
cause
and
another
at
any
rate
i
could
think
of
no
other
openings
in
the
docks
but
those
between
the
ships
and
the
jetties
and
at
the
which
people
sometimes
fell
into
in
the
dark
and
i
gathered
a
hazy
notion
that
i
was
expected
to
make
things
comfortable
by
going
out
and
drowning
myself
yes
of
course
it
would
said
the
fat
aunt
it
stands
to
reason
said
a
thin
one
anybody
can
see
said
the
others
and
many
a
boy
gone
out
to
work
no
older
ah
and
been
members
o
parliament
afterwards
too
the
prospect
of
an
entry
into
parliament
presented
so
stupefying
a
contrast
with
that
of
an
immersion
in
the
dock
that
for
some
time
the
ensuing
conversation
made
little
impression
on
me
on
the
part
of
my
mother
relations
it
was
mainly
a
repetition
of
what
had
gone
before
very
much
in
the
same
words
and
as
to
my
grandfather
he
had
little
to
say
at
all
but
expressed
himself
so
far
as
he
might
by
furtive
pats
on
my
back
pats
increasing
in
intensity
as
the
talk
of
the
ladies
pointed
especially
and
unpleasingly
to
myself
till
at
last
the
food
and
drink
were
all
gone
whereupon
the
fat
aunt
sighed
her
last
moral
sentiment
uncle
martha
was
duly
shoved
out
on
the
quay
and
i
was
left
alone
with
grandfather
nat
well
stevy
ol
mate
said
my
grandfather
drawing
me
on
his
knee
us
two
left
alone
left
alone
ol
mate
i
had
not
cried
much
that
day
scarce
at
all
in
fact
since
first
meeting
my
grandfather
in
the
passage
and
discovering
his
empty
pocket
for
as
i
have
said
i
was
a
little
dull
in
the
head
and
trying
hard
to
think
of
many
things
but
now
i
cried
indeed
with
my
face
against
my
grandfather
shoulder
and
there
was
something
of
solace
in
the
outburst
and
when
at
last
i
looked
up
i
saw
two
bright
drops
hanging
in
the
wiry
tangle
of
my
grandfather
beard
and
another
lodged
in
the
furrow
under
one
eye
done
stevy
said
my
grandfather
do
cry
no
more
come
home
along
o
me
now
wo
ye
an
we
go
in
the
london
dock
where
the
sugar
is
i
looked
round
the
room
and
considered
as
well
as
my
sodden
little
head
would
permit
i
had
never
been
in
the
london
dock
which
was
a
wonderful
place
as
i
had
gathered
from
my
grandfather
descriptions
a
paradise
where
sugar
lay
about
the
very
ground
in
lumps
and
where
you
might
eat
it
if
you
would
so
long
as
you
brought
none
away
but
here
was
my
home
with
nobody
else
to
take
care
of
it
and
i
felt
some
muddled
sense
of
a
new
responsibility
i
i
ca
leave
the
place
nat
i
said
with
a
dismal
shake
of
the
head
father
might
come
home
an
he
would
know
an
an
so
an
so
you
think
you
got
to
stop
an
keep
house
my
grandfather
asked
bending
his
face
down
to
mine
the
prospect
had
been
oppressing
my
muzzy
faculties
all
day
if
i
escaped
being
taken
away
plainly
i
must
keep
house
and
cook
and
buy
things
and
scrub
floors
at
any
rate
till
my
father
came
home
though
it
seemed
a
great
deal
to
undertake
alone
so
i
answered
with
a
nod
and
a
forlorn
sniff
good
pluck
good
pluck
exclaimed
my
grandfather
exultantly
clapping
his
hand
twice
on
my
head
and
rubbing
it
vigorously
stevy
ol
mate
me
an
you
get
on
capital
i
knowed
you
make
a
plucked
but
you
wo
have
to
keep
house
alone
jest
yet
no
you
an
me
keep
house
together
stevy
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
your
father
wo
be
home
a
while
yet
an
i
settle
all
about
this
here
place
but
lord
what
a
pluck
for
a
shaver
and
he
brightened
wonderfully
in
truth
there
had
been
little
enough
of
courage
in
my
poor
little
body
and
grandfather
nat
words
brought
me
a
deal
of
relief
beyond
the
vague
terrors
of
loneliness
and
responsibility
i
had
been
troubled
by
the
reflection
that
housekeeping
cost
money
and
i
had
none
for
though
my
mother
note
had
been
sent
in
the
regular
way
to
viney
and
marr
a
week
before
there
had
been
neither
reply
nor
return
of
the
paper
the
circumstance
was
unprecedented
and
unaccountable
though
the
explanation
came
before
very
long
for
the
present
however
the
difficulty
was
put
aside
i
put
my
hand
in
my
grandfather
and
the
door
being
locked
behind
us
and
the
key
in
his
pocket
we
went
out
together
on
the
quay
over
the
bridge
and
into
the
life
that
was
to
be
new
for
us
both
chapter
ii
in
blue
gate
while
his
mother
relations
walked
out
of
stephen
tale
and
left
his
grandfather
in
it
the
tales
of
all
the
world
went
on
each
man
hero
in
his
own
viney
and
marr
were
owners
of
the
brig
away
in
tropic
seas
with
stephen
father
chief
mate
and
at
this
time
the
tale
of
viney
and
marr
had
just
divided
into
two
inasmuch
as
the
partners
were
separated
and
the
firm
was
at
a
crisis
the
crisis
responsible
for
the
withholding
of
kemp
no
legal
form
had
dissolved
the
firm
indeed
and
scarce
half
a
mile
of
streets
lay
between
the
two
men
but
in
truth
marr
had
left
his
partner
with
uncommon
secrecy
and
expedition
carrying
with
him
all
the
loose
cash
he
could
get
together
and
a
man
need
travel
a
very
little
way
to
hide
in
london
so
it
was
that
viney
left
alone
to
bear
the
firm
burdens
was
loafing
sometimes
about
his
house
in
commercial
road
stepney
sometimes
in
the
back
streets
and
small
hard
by
pondering
no
doubt
the
matter
contained
in
a
paper
that
had
that
afternoon
stricken
the
colour
from
the
face
of
one
crooks
of
shadwell
and
had
hardly
less
disquieted
others
in
related
trades
while
marr
for
the
few
days
since
his
flight
no
more
dressed
like
the
business
partner
in
a
shipowning
concern
nor
even
like
a
clerk
but
in
serge
and
anklejacks
like
a
foremast
hand
was
playing
up
to
his
borrowed
character
by
being
drunk
in
blue
gate
the
blue
gate
is
gone
now
it
went
with
many
places
of
a
history
only
less
black
when
ratcliff
highway
was
put
to
rout
as
you
left
high
street
shadwell
for
the
highway
they
made
one
thoroughfare
the
blue
gate
was
on
your
right
almost
opposite
an
evil
lane
that
led
downhill
to
the
new
dock
blue
gate
fields
it
was
more
fully
called
though
there
was
as
little
of
a
field
as
of
a
gate
blue
or
other
about
the
place
which
was
a
street
narrow
foul
and
forbidding
leading
up
to
back
lane
it
was
a
bad
and
a
dangerous
place
the
worst
in
all
that
neighbourhood
worse
than
frederick
street
worse
than
tiger
bay
the
sailor
once
brought
to
anchor
in
blue
gate
was
lucky
to
get
out
with
clothes
to
cover
him
lucky
if
he
saved
no
more
than
his
life
yet
sailors
were
there
in
plenty
hilarious
shouting
drunk
and
drugged
horrible
draggled
women
pawed
them
over
for
whatever
their
pockets
might
yield
and
murderous
ruffians
were
ready
at
hand
whenever
a
knock
on
the
head
could
solve
a
difficulty
front
doors
stood
ever
open
in
the
blue
gate
and
some
houses
had
no
front
doors
at
all
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
grimy
flights
of
stairs
thus
made
accessible
from
the
street
was
a
noisy
and
room
noisy
because
of
the
company
it
held
partly
because
of
their
tobacco
but
chiefly
because
of
the
tobacco
and
the
liquor
of
many
that
had
been
there
before
and
because
of
the
aged
foulness
of
the
whole
building
there
were
five
in
the
room
four
men
and
a
woman
one
of
the
men
was
marr
though
for
the
present
he
was
not
using
that
name
he
was
noticeable
amid
the
group
being
cleaner
than
the
rest
and
dressed
like
a
sailor
ashore
though
he
lacked
the
sunburn
that
was
proper
to
the
character
but
sailor
or
none
there
he
sat
where
many
had
sat
before
him
a
piece
of
the
familiar
prey
of
blue
gate
babbling
drunk
and
reasonless
the
others
were
watchfully
sober
enough
albeit
with
a
great
pretence
of
jollity
they
had
drunk
level
with
the
babbler
but
had
been
careful
to
water
his
drink
with
gin
as
for
him
he
swayed
and
lolled
sometimes
on
the
table
before
him
sometimes
on
the
shoulder
of
the
woman
at
his
side
she
was
no
beauty
with
her
coarse
features
dull
eyes
and
tousled
hair
her
thick
voice
and
her
rusty
finery
but
indeed
she
was
the
least
repulsive
of
that
foul
company
on
the
victim
opposite
side
sat
a
bony
fellow
with
a
thin
unhealthy
face
that
seemed
to
belong
to
some
other
body
and
dress
that
proclaimed
him
ruffian
the
woman
called
him
dan
and
nods
and
winks
passed
between
the
two
over
the
drooping
head
between
them
next
dan
was
an
ugly
rascal
with
a
broken
nose
singular
in
that
place
as
bearing
in
his
dress
none
of
the
marks
of
waterside
habits
crimpery
and
the
highway
but
seeming
rather
the
commonplace
town
rat
of
shoreditch
or
whitechapel
and
last
a
blind
fiddler
sat
in
a
corner
fiddling
a
flourish
from
time
to
time
roaring
with
foul
jest
and
roiling
his
single
white
eye
upward
no
i
another
the
man
said
staring
about
him
with
uncertain
eyes
got
bishness
to
i
say
wha

the
woman
answered
playfully

i
shay
this
won
do

this
with
an
owlish
wink
at
the
bottle
before
him
dan
and
the
woman
exchanged
a
quick
look
plainly
something
had
gone
before
that
gave
the
words
significance
no
marr
went
on

the

the
woman
remarked
still
playfully

the
chuckle
persisted
and
turned
to
a
stupid
grin
ha
ha
ha

have
it

way
this
with
a
clumsily
stealthy
grope
at
the
breast
pocket
a
movement
that
the
others
had
seen
before
and
remembered
have
it

way

cordially

the
blind
man
his
white
eye
rolling
and
blinking
horribly
at
the
ceiling
right
as

the

and

of

at

ended
with

marr
turned
and
stared
fishily
at

drivelling
assumption
of
dignity

the
blind
fiddler
stopped
midway
in
a
flourish
and
pursed
his
lips
silently
dan
looked
quickly
at
the
fiddler
and
as
quickly
back
at
the
drunken
man

and
the
turn

repeated

stopped

and

off
into

uneasily
at

large

in

moment
and
presently
the

slipped
the
watch
back
into

they
shut

whereupon

broke
into
a
torrent
of
curses
on
the
landing
and
presently
having
descended
several
of
the
stairs
reached
back
to
let
drive
a
thump
at
the
door
with
his
stick
and

her
eyes
were
dry
at
the
door
she
looked
back
with
something
like
a
shudder
and
then
turned
her
steps
down
the
street
the
two
partners
in
viney
and

were
separated

chapter

stephen
tale
i
had
never
been
home
with
grandfather
nat
before
i
fancy
that
some
scruples
of
my
mother
in
the
matter
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
character
of
the
company
to
be
seen
and
heard
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
had
hitherto
kept
me
from
the
house
and
even
from
the
sugary
elysium
of
the
london
dock
now
i
was
going
there
at
last
and
something
of
eager
anticipation
overcame
the
sorrow
of
the
day
we
went
in
an
omnibus
which
we
left
in
commercial
road
here
my
grandfather
took
order
to
repair
my
disappointment
in
the
matter
of
and
we
left
the
shop
with
such
a
bagful
that
it
would
not
go
into
the
accustomed
pocket
at
all
a
little
way
from
this
shop
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
stood
a
house
which
my
mother
had
more
than
once
pointed
out
to
me
already
and
as
we
came
abreast
of
it
now
grandfather
nat
pointed
it
out
also
know
who
lives
there
stevy
he
asked
yes
i
said
viney
that
father
ship
belongs
to
there
was
a
man
sitting
on
the
stone
baluster
by
the
landing
of
the
front
steps
having
apparently
just
desisted
from
knocking
at
the
door
he
was
pale
and
agitated
and
he
slapped
his
leg
distractedly
with
a
folded
paper
why
said
my
grandfather
that
crooks
the
he
looks
bad
wonder
what
up
with
that
the
door
opened
and
a
in
bonnet
and
shawl
emerged
with
her
box
lifting
and
dragging
it
as
best
she
might
the
man
rose
and
spoke
to
her
and
i
supposed
that
he
was
about
to
help
but
at
her
answer
he
sank
back
on
the
balustrade
and
she
hauled
the
box
to
the
pavement
by
herself
the
man
looked
worse
than
ever
now
and
he
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
so
that
it
struck
me
that
it
might
be
that
his
mother
also
was
dead
perhaps
and
at
the
thought
all
the
flavour
went
from
the
in
my
mouth
we
turned
up
a
narrow
street
which
led
us
to
a
part
where
the
river
plainly
was
nearer
at
every
step
for
well
i
knew
the
curious
smell
that
grew
as
we
went
and
that
had
in
it
something
of
tar
something
of
rope
and
junk
something
of
ships
stores
and
much
of
a
blend
of
unknown
outlandish
merchandise
we
met
sailors
some
with
parrots
and
accordions
and
many
with
undecided
legs
and
we
saw
more
of
the
fellows
who
were
not
sailors
though
they
dressed
in
the
same
way
and
got
an
inactive
living
out
of
sailors
somehow
they
leaned
on
posts
they
lurked
in
foul
entries
they
sat
on
sills
smoking
and
often
one
would
accost
and
hang
to
a
passing
sailor
with
a
grinning
cordiality
that
offended
and
repelled
me
child
as
i
was
and
there
were
big
coarse
women
with
flaring
clothes
and
hair
that
shone
with
grease
though
for
them
i
had
but
a
certain
wonder
as
for
why
they
all
seemed
to
live
near
the
docks
why
they
all
grew
so
stout
and
why
they
never
wore
bonnets
as
we
went
where
the
street
grew
fouler
and
more
crooked
and
where
dark
entries
and
many
turnings
gave
evidence
of
the
complication
of
courts
and
alleys
about
us
we
heard
a
hoarse
voice
crooning
a
stave
of
a
with
the
low
scrape
of
a
fiddle
striking
in
here
and
there
as
it
were
at
random
and
presently
there
turned
a
corner
ahead
and
faced
toward
us
a
blind
man
with
his
fiddle
held
low
against
his
chest
and
his
face
lifted
upward
a
little
aside
he
checked
at
the
corner
to
hit
the
wall
a
couple
of
taps
with
the
stick
that
hung
from
his
wrist
and
called
aloud
with
fouler
words
than
i
can
remember
or
could
print
now
then
damn
ye
ai
there
a
christian
as
wants
a
toon
o
george
who

george

ye
got
no

what
a
dirty
mean
lot
it
is
a
who
a
song
o
pore
george
o
damn
y
all
and
so
with
a
mutter
and
another
tap
of
the
stick
he
came
creeping
along
six
inches
at
a
step
the
stick
dangling
loose
again
and
the
bow
scraping
the
strings
to
the
song
fire
on
the
fire

the
bow

on
the
fire
down
below

water
fire
down
below
the
man
right
eye
was
closed
but
the
left
was
horribly
wide
and
white
and
rolling
and
it
quite
unpleasantly
reminded
me
of
a
large
china
marble
that
lay
at
that
moment
at
the
bottom
of
my
breeches
pocket
under
some
uniform
buttons
a
key
you
could
whistle
on
a
brass
knob
from
a
fender
and
a
tangle
of
string
so
much
indeed
was
i
possessed
with
this
uncomfortable
resemblance
in
later
weeks
when
i
had
seen
blind
george
often
and
knew
more
of
him
that
at
last
i
had
no
choice
but
to
fling
the
marble
into
the
river
though
indeed
it
was
something
of
a
rarity
in
marbles
and
worth
four
alleys
as
big
as
itself
my
grandfather
stopped
his
talk
as
we
drew
within
earshot
of
the
fiddler
but
blind
men
ears
are
keen
beyond
the
common
the
bow
dropped
from
the
fiddle
and
blind
george
sang
out
cheerily
why
comes
nat
from
the
funeral
and
got
little
grandson
what
goin
to
take
care
of
an
bring
up
so
moral
in
celebrated
o
call
all
to
my
extreme
amazement
for
what
should
this
strange
blind
man
know
of
me
or
of
my
mother
funeral
grandfather
nat
seemed
a
little
angry
well
well
he
said
your
ears
are
sharp
blind
george
they
learn
a
lot
as
ai
your
business
if
your
eyes
was
as
good
as
your
ears
you
ha
had
your
head
broke
this
a
dozen
times
if
my
eyes
was
as
good
as
my
ears
nat
kemp
the
other
retorted
there
many
as
would
find
it
so
easy
to
talk
o
my
other
people
business
lord
i
know
enough
to
some
of
that
what
i
know
i
could
tell
you
some
o
business
if
i
liked
some
as
you
do
know
yourself
look
you
bin
to
a
funeral
well
it
ai
the
last
funeral
as
be
wanted
in
your
family
see
the
kid
mother

do
you
be
too
sure
safe
i
bin
along
o
some
one
you
know
an
do
look
like
for
ever
do
ai
in
company
grandfather
nat
twitched
my
sleeve
and
we
walked
on
awright
the
blind
man
called
after
us
in
his
tone
of
affable
ferocity
awright
go
along
you
see
things
some
day
near
as
well
as
i
can
what
blind
that
a
bad
fellow
stevy
grandfather
nat
said
as
we
heard
the
fiddle
and
the
song
begin
again
do
you
listen
to
neither
his
talk
nor
his
songs
somehow
it
do
seem
to
see
a
blind
man
such
a
bad
but
a
bad
he
is
up
an
down
i
asked
how
he
came
to
know
about
the
funeral
and
especially
about
my
coming
to
wapping
a
thing
i
had
only
learned
of
myself
an
hour
before
my
grandfather
said
that
he
had
probably
learned
of
the
funeral
from
somebody
who
had
been
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
during
the
day
and
had
asked
the
reason
of
the
landlord
absence
and
as
to
myself
he
had
heard
my
step
and
guessed
its
meaning
instantly
he
a
keen
sharp
rascal
stevy
an
he
makes
out
all
of
parties
business
he
can
he
knew
your
father
was
away
an
he
jumped
the
whole
thing
at
once
that
his
way
but
i
do
stand
him
he
do
corne
into
my
house
barrin
he
comes
a
customer
which
i
ca
help
of
the
meaning
of
the
blind
man
talk
i
understood
little
but
he
shocked
me
with
a
sense
of
insult
and
more
with
one
of
surprise
for
i
had
entertained
a
belief
born
of
stories
that
blindness
produced
saintly
piety
unless
it
were
the
piety
that
caused
the
blindness
and
that
in
any
case
a
virtuous
meekness
was
an
essential
condition
of
the
affliction
so
i
walked
in
doubt
and
cogitation
and
so
after
a
dive
down
a
narrower
street
than
any
we
had
yet
traversed
it
could
scarce
be
dirtier
and
a
twist
through
a
steep
and
serpentine
alley
we
came
as
it
grew
dusk
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
of
riverside
inns
i
can
remember
plenty
but
never
before
or
since
have
i
beheld
an
odder
than
this
of
grandfather
nat
it
was
wooden
and
and
like
others
of
its
sort
it
was
everywhere
larger
at
top
than
at
bottom
but
the
hole
in
the
wall
was
not
only
but
also
most
alarmingly
lopsided
by
its
side
and
half
under
it
lay
a
narrow
passage
through
which
one
saw
a
strip
of
the
river
and
its
many
craft
and
the
passage
ended
in
stairs
all
of
the
house
that
was
above
the
ground
floor
on
this
side
rested
on
a
row
of
posts
which
stood
near
the
middle
of
the
passage
and
the
burden
of
these
posts
twisted
wavy
bulging
and
shapeless
hung
still
more
toward
the
opposite
building
while
the
farther
side
bounded
by
a
later
brick
house
was
vertical
as
though
a
great
wedge
point
downward
had
been
cut
away
to
permit
the
rise
of
the
newer
wall
and
the
effect
was
as
of
a
reeling
and
toppling
of
the
whole
construction
away
from
its
neighbour
and
an
imminent
downfall
into
the
passage
and
when
later
i
examined
the
side
looking
across
the
river
supported
on
piles
and
bulging
and
toppling
over
them
also
i
decided
that
what
kept
the
hole
in
the
wall
from
crashing
into
the
passage
was
nothing
but
its
countervailing
inclination
to
tumble
into
the
river
painted
large
over
the
boards
of
the
front
whose
lapped
edges
gave
the
letters
ragged
outlines
were
the
words
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
below
a
little
smaller
nathaniel
kemp
i
felt
a
certain
pride
i
think
in
the
importance
thus
given
the
family
name
and
my
esteem
of
my
grandfather
increased
proportionably
with
the
size
of
the
letters
there
was
a
great
noise
within
and
grandfather
nat
with
a
quick
look
toward
the
entrance
grunted
angrily
but
we
passed
up
the
passage
and
entered
by
a
private
door
under
the
posts
this
door
opened
directly
into
the
bar
parlour
the
floor
whereof
was
two
steps
below
the
level
of
the
outer
paving
and
the
size
whereof
was
about
thrice
that
of
a
the
din
of
a
quarrel
and
a
scuffle
came
from
the
bar
and
my
grandfather
thrusting
me
into
a
corner
and
giving
me
his
hat
ran
out
with
a
roar
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
at
the
sound
the
quarrel
hushed
in
its
height
what
this
my
grandfather
blared
with
a
thump
on
the
counter
that
made
the
pots
jump
what
sort
of
a
row
this
in
my
house
damme
i
break
y
in
halves
every
mother
son
of
ye
i
peeped
through
the
glass
partition
and
saw
first
the
back
of
the
potman
head
for
the
took
another
drop
and
beyond
that
and
the
row
of
a
group
of
rough
hulking
men
one
with
blood
on
his
face
and
all
with
an
odd
look
of
sulky
guilt
out
you
go
pursued
grandfather
nat
every
swab
o
ye
ca
leave
the
place
not
even
to
go
to
not
for
nothin
without
a
row
like
this
givin
the
house
a
bad
name
go
on
jim
crute
unless
i
to
chuck
ye
the
men
had
begun
filing
out
awkwardly
with
nothing
but
here
and
there
awright
awright
goin
ai
i
and
the
like
but
one
big
ruffian
lagged
behind
scowling
and
murmuring
rebelliously
in
a
flash
grandfather
nat
was
through
the
with
a
dart
of
his
long
left
arm
he
had
gripped
the
fellow
ear
and
spun
him
round
with
a
wrench
that
i
thought
had
torn
the
ear
from
the
head
and
in
the
same
moment
had
caught
him
by
the
opposite
wrist
so
as
to
stretch
the
man
extended
arm
elbow
backward
across
his
own
great
chest
a
posture
in
which
the
backward
pull
against
the
elbow
joint
brought
a
yell
of
agony
from
the
victim
only
a
man
with
extraordinarily
long
arms
could
have
done
the
thing
exactly
like
that
the
movement
was
so
savagely
sudden
that
my
grandfather
had
kicked
open
the
door
and
flung
jim
crute
headlong
into
the
street
ere
i
quite
understood
it
when
there
came
a
check
in
my
throat
and
tears
in
my
eyes
to
see
the
man
so
cruelly
handled
grandfather
nat
stood
a
moment
at
the
door
but
it
seemed
that
his
customer
was
quelled
effectually
for
presently
he
turned
inward
again
with
such
a
grim
scowl
as
i
had
never
seen
before
and
at
that
a
queer
head
appeared
just
above
the
counter
i
had
supposed
the
bar
to
be
wholly
cleared
and
a
very
weak
and
rather
womanish
voice
said
in
tones
of
indignation
serve
right
kemp
i
sure
lot
o
impudent
vagabones
ought
to
be
ashamed
o
theirselves
that
they
ought
pity
every
ai
kep
as
strict
as
this
one
is
that
what
i
say
and
the
queer
head
looked
round
the
vacant
bar
with
an
air
of
virtuous
defiance
as
though
anxious
to
meet
the
eye
of
any
so
bold
as
to
contradict
it
was
anything
but
a
clean
face
on
the
head
and
it
was
overshadowed
by
a
very
greasy
wideawake
hat
grubbiness
and
unhealthy
redness
contended
for
mastery
in
the
features
of
which
the
nose
was
the
most
surprising
wide
and
bulbous
and
knobbed
all
over
so
that
ever
afterward
in
any
attempt
to
look
cripps
in
the
face
i
found
myself
wholly
disregarding
his
eyes
and
fixing
a
fascinated
gaze
on
his
nose
and
i
could
never
recall
his
face
to
memory
as
i
recalled
another
but
always
as
a
nose
garnished
with
a
fringe
of
inferior
features
the
face
had
been
shaved
apparently
about
a
week
before
and
by
the
sides
hung
long
hair
dirtier
to
look
at
than
the
rest
of
the
apparition
my
grandfather
gave
no
more
than
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
this
little
man
passed
the
counter
and
me
pulling
off
his
coat
as
he
came
something
of
my
tingling
eyes
and
screwed
mouth
was
visible
i
suppose
for
he
stooped
as
he
rolled
up
his
and
said
why
stevy
boy
what
amiss
you
you
hurt
the
man
ear
i
said
with
a
choke
and
a
sniff
for
till
then
grandfather
nat
had
seemed
to
me
the
kindest
man
in
the
world
grandfather
nat
looked
mightily
astonished
he
left
his
where
it
was
and
thrust
his
fingers
up
in
his
hair
behind
through
the
grey
and
out
at
the
brown
on
top
what
he
said
hurt
hurt
why
i
did
he
ai
a
friend
o
yours
is
he
young
i
shook
my
head
and
blinked
there
was
a
gleam
of
amusement
in
my
grandfather
grim
face
as
he
sat
in
a
chair
and
took
me
between
his
knees
hurt
he
repeated
why
lord
love
ye
get
hurt
if
i
did
hurt
some
of
now
an
then
they
a
rough
lot
a
bitter
bad
lot
round
here
an
it
hurt
or
be
hurt
with
them
stevy
i
got
to
frighten
my
boy
an
i
do
it
too
i
was
passing
my
fingers
to
and
fro
in
the
matted
hair
on
my
grandfather
arm
and
thinking
he
seemed
a
very
terrible
man
now
and
perhaps
something
of
a
hero
for
young
as
i
was
i
was
a
boy
so
presently
i
said
did
you
ever
kill
a
man
nat
chapter
iv
stephen
tale
many
small
matters
of
my
first
few
hours
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
were
impressed
on
me
by
later
events
in
particular
i
remember
the
innocent
curiosity
with
which
i
asked
did
you
ever
kill
a
man
nat
there
was
a
twitch
and
a
frown
on
my
grandfather
face
and
he
sat
back
as
one
at
a
moment
disadvantage
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
was
trying
to
remember
but
he
only
said
gruffly
and
with
a
quick
sound
like
a
snort
very
nigh
killed
myself
once
or
twice
stevy
in
my
time
and
rose
hastily
from
his
chair
to
reach
a
picture
of
a
ship
that
was
standing
on
a
shelf
there
he
said
that
a
new
just
done
pretty
picter
ai
it
an
that
there
pointing
to
another
hanging
on
the
wall
that
the
what
your
father
on
now
i
had
noticed
that
the
walls
both
of
the
bar
and
of
the
were
plentifully
hung
with
paintings
of
ships
ships
becalmed
ships
in
full
sail
ships
under
bare
spars
all
with
painful
blue
skies
over
them
and
very
seas
beneath
and
ships
in
storms
with
torn
sails
pursued
by
rumbustious
piles
of
sooty
cloud
and
pelted
with
lengths
of
scarlet
lightning
i
fear
i
should
not
have
recognised
my
father
ship
without
help
but
that
was
probably
because
i
had
only
seen
it
months
before
lying
in
dock
battered
and
dingy
with
a
confusion
of
casks
and
bales
about
the
deck
and
naked
yards
dangling
above
whereas
in
the
picture
which
was
a
mile
too
small
for
the
brig
it
was
booming
along
under
a
flatulent
mountain
of
clean
white
sail
and
bulwarks
and
were
gay
with
lively
and
diversified
colour
i
said
something
about
its
being
a
fine
ship
or
a
fine
picture
and
that
there
were
a
lot
of
them
ah
he
said
they
do
mount
up
one
arter
another
it
one
gentleman
as
did
all
him
out
in
the
bar
now
with
the
long
hair
sometimes
i
think
i
rather
money
but
it
a
talent
that
what
it
is
the
artist
beyond
the
outer
bar
had
been
talking
to
the
potman
now
he
coughed
and
said
ha
um
kemp
sir
kemp
no
doubt
as
you
the
noos
no
said
grandfather
nat
finishing
the
rolling
of
his
as
he
stepped
down
into
the
bar
not
as
i
know
on
what
is
it
not
about
viney
and
marr
no
what
about
cripps
rose
on
his
toes
with
the
importance
of
his
information
and
his
eyes
widened
to
a
moment
rivalry
with
his
nose
gone
wrong
he
said
in
a
shrill
whisper
that
was
as
loud
as
his
natural
voice
gone
wrong
unsolvent
cracked
up
broke
busted
in
a
common
way
speakin
and
he
gave
a
violent
nod
with
each
synonym
no
said
grandfather
nat
surely
not
viney
and
marr
fact
i
can
assure
you
on
it
what
i
might
call
the
universal
topic
in
neighbourin
circles
an
a
subjick
o
local
discussion
you
it
this
if
you
bin
at
my
grandfather
whistled
and
rested
a
hand
on
a
not
a
stiver
for
nobody
they
say
cripps
pursued
not
till
they
can
sell
the
wessels
what
there
was
loose
marr
bolted
with
or
as
you
might
put
it
absconded
absconded
with
the
proceeds
an
gone
abroad

said
i
see
the
servant
gal
bringin
out
her
box
from
viney
just
now
said
grandfather
nat
an
crooks
the
was
on
the
steps
very
white
in
the
gills
with
a
paper
well
well
an
you
say
bolted
absconded
kemp
absconded
with
the
proceeds
the
twig
viney
says
robbed
as
well
as
the
creditors
but
i
some
the
creditors
observation
is
an
they
say
the

pawned
up
to
their
up
to
their
well
commented
my
grandfather
i
would
ha
thought
it
the
was
that
badly
found
an
they
did
everything
that
cheap
i
thought
they
made
money
hand
over

kemp
flyin

you
knowed
viney
long
elevated
hisself
into
a
owner
did
you
what
was
he
then
why
was
your
mate
one
was
he
ay
an
more
so
i
tell
well
arter
that
surely
was
flyin
too
now
marr
absconded
with
the
proceeds
the
talk
in
the
bar
went
on
being
almost
entirely
the
talk
of
cripps
who
valued
himself
on
the
unwonted
importance
his
news
gave
him
and
aimed
at
increasing
it
by
saying
the
same
thing
a
great
many
times
by
saying
it
too
when
he
could
in
terms
and
phrases
that
had
a
strong
flavour
of
the
sunday
paper
but
as
for
me
i
soon
ceased
to
hear
for
i
discovered
something
of
greater
interest
on
the
shelf
that
skirted
the
it
was
a
little
model
of
a
ship
in
a
glass
case
and
it
was
a
great
marvel
to
me
with
all
its
standing
and
running
rigging
complete
and
a
most
ingenious
and
tumultuous
sea
about
it
made
of
stiff
calico
cockled
up
into
lumps
and
ridges
and
painted
the
proper
colour
much
better
than
either
of
the
two
we
had
at
home
for
these
latter
were
only
each
nothing
but
of
a
little
ship
split
from
stem
to
stern
and
stuck
against
a
board
on
which
were
painted
sky
clouds
seagulls
and
in
one
case
a
lighthouse
an
exasperating
that
had
been
my
continual
disappointment
but
this
was
altogether
so
charming
and
delightful
and
real
and
the
little
hatches
and
so
thrilled
my
fancy
that
i
resolved
to
beg
of
my
grandfather
to
let
me
call
the
model
my
own
and
sometimes
have
the
glass
case
off
so
i
was
absorbed
while
the
conversation
in
the
bar
ranged
from
the
ships
and
their
owners
to
my
father
and
from
him
to
me
as
was
plain
when
my
grandfather
called
me
here
he
is
said
my
grandfather
with
a
deal
of
pride
in
his
voice
putting
his
foot
on
a
stool
and
lifting
me
on
his
knee
here
he
is
a
plucked
ai
ye
stevy
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
my
head
as
he
was
fond
of
doing
plucked
ah
why
he
was
agoin
to
keep
house
all
by
hisself
with
all
the
pluck
in
life
till
his
father
come
home
ye
stevy
boy
but
he
come
along
o
me
instead
an
him
an
me
to
keep
the
hole
in
the
wall
together
ai
we
pardners
eh
stevy
i
think
i
never
afterwards
saw
my
grandfather
talking
so
familiarly
with
his
customers
i
perceived
now
that
there
was
another
in
the
bar
in
addition
to
cripps
a
pale
quiet
and
rather
ragged
man
who
sat
in
an
obscure
corner
with
an
untouched
glass
of
liquor
by
him
come
said
my
grandfather
have
one
with
me
cripps
an
drink
the
new
pardner
health
what
is
it
an
you
you
drink
up
too
have
another
this
last
order
grandfather
nat
flung
at
the
man
in
the
corner
just
in
the
tones
in
which
i
had
heard
a
skipper
on
a
ship
tell
a
man
to
get
forrard
lively
with
a
rope
fender
opposite
our
quay
at
blackwall
i
sure
wishin
the
young
master
every
an
said
cripps
beaming
on
me
with
a
grin
that
rather
frightened
than
pleased
me
it
twisted
the
nose
so
every
and
sure
the
pale
man
in
the
corner
only
looked
up
quickly
as
if
fearful
of
obtruding
himself
gulped
the
drink
that
had
been
standing
by
him
and
receiving
another
put
it
down
untasted
where
the
first
had
stood
that
ai
drinkin
a
health
said
my
grandfather
angrily
there
that
it
and
he
pointed
to
the
new
drink
with
the
hand
that
held
his
own
the
pale
man
lifted
it
hurriedly
stood
up
looked
at
me
and
said
something
indistinct
gulped
the
liquor
and
returned
the
glass
to
the
counter
whereupon
the
potman
without
orders
instantly
refilled
it
and
the
man
carried
it
back
to
his
corner
and
put
it
down
beside
him
as
before
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
pale
man
suffered
from
some
complaint
that
made
it
dangerous
to
leave
him
without
a
drink
close
at
hand
ready
to
be
swallowed
at
a
moment
notice
but
cripps
blinked
first
at
his
own
glass
and
then
at
the
pale
man
and
i
fancy
he
thought
himself
unfairly
treated
howbeit
his
affability
was
unconquerable
he
grinned
and
snapped
his
fingers
playfully
at
me
provoking
my
secret
indignation
since
that
was
what
people
did
to
please
babies
an
a
pretty
young
gent
is
too
said
cripps
of
considerable
personal
attractions
goin
to
bring
up
to
the
trade
i
kemp
why
no
said
grandfather
nat
with
some
dignity
no
something
better
than
that
i
hopin
pardners
is
all
very
well
for
a
bit
but
stevy
goin
to
be
a
cut
above
his
poor
old
if
i
can
do
it
eh
boy
he
rubbed
my
head
again
and
i
was
too
shy
sitting
there
in
the
bar
to
answer
eh
boy
boardin
school
an
a
gentleman
job
for
this
one
if
the
old
man
has
his
way
cripps
shook
his
head
sagaciously
and
could
plainly
see
that
i
was
cut
out
for
a
statesman
he
also
lifted
his
empty
glass
looked
at
it
abstractedly
and
put
it
down
again
nothing
coming
of
this
he
complimented
my
personal
appearance
once
more
and
thought
that
my
portrait
should
certainly
be
painted
as
a
memorial
in
my
future
days
of
greatness
this
notion
seemed
to
strike
my
grandfather
rather
favourably
and
he
forthwith
consulted
a
slate
which
dangled
by
a
string
during
his
contemplation
of
which
with
its
long
rows
of
strokes
cripps
betrayed
a
certain
anxious
discomfort
well
said
grandfather
nat
at
length
you
are
pretty
deep
in
you
know
an
it
might
as
well
be
that
as
anything
else
but
what
about
that
sign
ai
i
ever
goin
to
get
that
cripps
knitted
his
brows
and
his
nose
turned
up
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
it
ai
come
to
me
yet
kemp
he
said
not
yet
still
waiting
for
what
you
might
call
an
inspiration
but
when
it
comes
kemp
when
it
comes
ah
you
a
sign
then
sich
a
sign
you
sich
a
sign
as
attract
the
artistic
feelin
of
wapping
an
surroundin
districks
of
the
metropolis
i
assure
you
the
signs
on
the
other
phoo
cripps
made
a
sweep
of
the
hand
which
i
took
to
indicate
generally
that
all
other
publicans
overwhelmed
with
humiliation
would
have
no
choice
but
straightway
to
tear
down
their
own
signs
and
bury
them
umph
but
meanwhile
i
have
got
one
at
all
objected
grandfather
nat
an
they
have
ah
yes
sir
some
sort
o
signs
but
done
by
mere
jobbers
and
poor
enough
too
my
hart
kemp
i
respect
my
hart
an
i
do
rush
at
a
job
like
that
it
wants
conception
sir
a
job
like
that
conception
the
common
sort
o
sign
easy
enough
you
go
at
it
an
you
do
it
or
hexicute
it
an
when
it
done
or
hexicuted
why
there
it
is
a
ship
maybe
or
a
crown
or
a
turk
or
three
cats
an
a
fryin
pan
simple
enough
no
plannin
no
composition
no
invention
but
a
in
a
wall
kemp
it
takes
a
hartist
to
make
a
picter
o
that
an
it
takes
study
an
meditation
an
invention
simplest
thing
o
the
lot
said
captain
nat
a
wall
an
a
hole
in
it
simplest
thing
o
the
lot
as
you
observe
kemp
it
may
seem
simple
enough
that
because
you
thinkin
o
subjick
instead
o
treatment
a
common
jobber
if
you
excuse
my
sayin
it
look
at
it
just
in
that
light

wall
with
a
in

give

the
noblest
instinks
of
the
kemp
i
do
to
say
that
my

the
wall
when
you
get
it
will
be
ah
it
be
the
moral
palladium
of
wapping
i
get
it
my
grandfather
replied
with
a
chuckle
anything
might
happen
without
surprisin
me
i
think
i
might
be
so
startled
as
to
forget
the
bit
you
had
on
account
an
pay
full
cash
cripps
eyes
brightened
at
the
hint
you
always
very
in
matters
o
business
kemp
he
said
an
i
always
say
so
which
reminds
me
speakin
of
things
this
morning
goin
to
see
my
friend
as
keeps
the
mortuary
i
see
as
a
bit
o
panel
for
to
paint
a
sign
as
ever
i
come
across
a
lovely
bit
o
stuff
to
be
sure
enough
to
stimulate
anybody
artistic
invention
to
look
at
it
that
it
was
not
dear
neither
particular
moderate
in
fact
i
afraid
it
may
be
gone
now
but
if
i
the
money
a
noise
of
trampling
and
singing
without
neared
the
door
and
with
a
bang
and
a
stagger
a
party
of
fresh
customers
burst
in
and
swept
cripps
out
of
his
exposition
two
were
sailors
shouting
and
jovial
but
the
rest
men
and
women
sober
and
villainous
in
their
mock
jollity
were
plain
to
see
the
foremost
sailor
drove
against
cripps
and
having
almost
knocked
him
down
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
involved
him
in
his
flounderings
apologising
meanwhile
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
demanding
to
know
what
cripps
would
drink
whereupon
grandfather
nat
sent
me
back
to
the
and
the
little
ship
and
addressed
himself
to
business
and
the
order
of
the
bar
and
so
he
was
occupied
for
the
most
of
the
evening
sometimes
he
sat
with
me
and
taught
me
the
spars
and
rigging
of
the
model
sometimes
i
peeped
through
the
glass
at
the
business
of
the
house
the
bar
remained
pretty
full
throughout
the
evening
in
its
main
part
and
my
grandfather
ruled
its
frequenters
with
a
strong
voice
and
an
iron
hand
but
there
was
one
little
space
partitioned
off
as
it
might
be
for
the
better
company
which
space
was
nearly
always
empty
into
this
quieter
compartment
i
saw
a
man
come
rather
late
in
the
evening
furtive
and
a
little
flustered
he
was
an
ugly
ruffian
with
a
broken
nose
and
he
was
noticeable
as
being
the
one
man
i
had
seen
in
my
grandfather
house
who
had
no
marks
of
seafaring
or
riverside
life
about
him
but
seemed
merely
an
ordinary
london
blackguard
from
some
unmaritime
neighbourhood
he
beckoned
silently
to
grandfather
nat
who
walked
across
and
conferred
with
him
presently
my
grandfather
left
the
counter
and
came
into
the
he
had
something
in
his
closed
hand
which
he
carried
to
the
lamp
to
examine
so
that
i
could
see
it
was
a
silver
watch
while
the
furtive
man
waited
expectantly
in
the
little
compartment
the
watch
interested
me
for
the
inward
part
swung
clean
out
from
the
case
and
hung
by
a
single
hinge
in
a
way
i
had
never
seen
before
i
noticed
also
that
a
large
capital
letter
m
was
engraved
on
the
back
grandfather
nat
shut
the
watch
and
strode
into
the
bar
here
you
are
he
said
aloud
handing
it
to
the
man
here
you
are
it
seems
all
right
good
enough
watch
i
should
say
the
man
was
plainly
disconcerted
frightened
indeed
by
this
public
observation
and
answered
with
an
eager
whisper
what
my
grandfather
replied
louder
than
ever
want
me
to
buy
it
not
me
this
ai
a
pawnshop
i
do
want
a
watch
an
if
i
did
how
do
i
know
where
you
got
it
much
discomposed
by
this
rebuff
the
fellow
hurried
off
whereupon
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
pale
man
rise
from
the
corner
of
the
bar
put
his
drink
still
untasted
in
a
safe
place
on
the
counter
beyond
the
edge
of
the
partition
and
hurry
out
also
cogitating
this
matter
in
my
grandfather
presently
i
fell
asleep
what
woke
me
at
length
was
the
loud
voice
of
grandfather
nat
and
i
found
that
it
was
late
and
he
was
clearing
the
bar
before
shutting
up
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
looked
out
and
was
interested
to
see
that
the
pale
man
had
come
back
and
was
now
swallowing
his
drink
at
last
before
going
out
after
the
rest
whereat
i
turned
again
drowsily
enough
to
the
model
ship
but
a
little
later
when
grandfather
nat
and
i
were
at
supper
in
the
and
i
was
dropping
to
sleep
again
i
was
amazed
to
see
my
grandfather
pull
the
man
watch
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
a
tin
at
that
i
rubbed
my
eyes
and
opened
them
so
wide
on
the
that
grandfather
nat

in
the

the
hole
in
the
wall
being
closed
its
customers
went
their
several
ways
the
sailors
shouting
and
singing
drifting
off
with
their
retinue
along
wapping

toward
ratcliff

fuller
than
usual
of
free

were

off

had
drunk
too
much
and
too
long
ever
to
be
noticeably
drunk
and
last
of
all
when
the
most
undecided
of
the
stragglers
from
captain
nat
kemp
bar
had
vanished
one
way
or
another
the
pale
quiet
man
moved
out
from
the
shadow
and
went
in
the
wake
of
the
noisy
sailors
the
night
was
dark
and
the
streets
the
lamps
were
few
and
feeble
and
angles
alleys
and
entries
were
shapes
of
blackness
that
seemed
more
solid
than
the
walls
about
them
but
instead
of
the
silence
that
consorts
with
gloom
the
air
was
racked
with
human
sounds
sounds
of
quarrels
scuffles
and
brawls
far
and
near
breaking
out
fitfully
amid
the
general
buzz
and
whoop
of
discordant
singing
that
came
from
all
wapping
and
ratcliff
where
revellers
rolled
into
the
open
a
stone
throw
on
the
pale

way
was
a
swing
bridge
with
a
lock
by
its
side
spanning
the
channel
that
joined
two
the
pale
man
passing
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
footpath
stopped
in
an
angle
three
policemen
were
coming
over
the
bridge
in
company
they
went
in
threes
in
these
parts
and
the
pale
man
who
never
made
closer
acquaintance
with
the
police
than
he
could
help
slunk
down
by
the
as
though
designing
to
make
the
crossing
by
way
of
the
narrow
lock
no
safe
passage
in
the
dark
but
he
thought
better
of
it
and
went
by
the
bridge
as
soon
as
the
policemen
had
passed
a
little
farther
and
he
was
in
ratcliff
highway
where
it
joined
with
shadwell
high
street
and
just
before
him
stood
paddy
goose
the
house
was
known
by
that
name
far
beyond
the
neighbourhood
among
people
who
were
unaware
that
the
actual
painted
sign
was
the
white
swan
goose
was
still
open
for
its
doors
never
closed
till
one
though
there
were
a
few
houses
later
even
than
this
where
though
the
bars
were
cleared
and
closed
at
one
in
accordance
with
act
of
parliament
the
doors
swung
wide
again
ten
minutes
later
there
was
still
dancing
within
at
paddy
goose
and
the
squeak
of
fiddles
and
the
thump
of
feet
were
plain
to
hear
the
pale
man
passed
on
into
the
dark
beyond
its
lights
and
soon
the
black
mouth
of
blue
gate
stood
on
his
right
blue
gate
gave
its
part
to
the
night
noises
and
more
for
a
sudden
burst
of
loud
screams
a
woman
rent
the
air
from
its
innermost
deeps
screams
which
affected
the
pale
man
not
at
all
nor
any
other
passenger
for
it
might
be
murder
or
it
might
be
drink
or
sudden
rage
or
fear
or
a
quarrel
and
whatever
it
might
be
was
common
enough
in
blue
gate
paddy
goose
had
no
monopoly
of
music
and
the
common
plenty
of
street
fiddlers
was
the
greater
as
the
early
houses
closed
scarce
eighty
yards
from
blue
gate
stood
blind
george
fiddling
his
hardest
for
a
party
dancing
in
the
roadway
many
were
looking
on
drunk
or
sober
with
approving
shouts
and
every
face
was
ghastly
phosphorescent
in
the
glare
of
a
ship
that
a
noisy
negro
flourished
among
the
dancers
close
by
a
woman
and
a
man
were
quarrelling
in
the
middle
of
a
group
but
the
matter
had
no
attention
till
of
a
sudden
it
sprang
into
a
fight
and
the
man
and
another
were
punching
and
wrestling
in
a
heap
bare
to
the
waist
at
this
the
crowd
turned
from
the
dancers
and
the
negro
ran
yelping
to
shed
his
deathly
light
on
the
new
scene
the
crowd
howled
and
scrambled
and
a
drunken
sailor
fell
in
the
mud
quick
at
the
chance
a
ruffian
took
him
under
the
armpits
and
dragged
him
from
among
the
trampling
feet
to
a
near
entry
out
of
the
glare
there
he
propped
his
prey
with
many
friendly
words
and
dived
among
his
pockets
the
sailor
was
dazed
and
made
no
difficulty
till
the
thief
got
to
the
end
of
the
search
in
a
trouser
pocket
and
thence
pulled
a
handful
of
silver
with
that
the
victim
awoke
to
some
sense
of
affairs
and
made
a
move
to
rise
but
the
other
sprang
up
and
laid
him
over
with
a
kick
on
the
head
just
as
the
pale
man
came
along
the
thief
made
off
leaving
a
few
shillings
and
sixpences
on
the
ground
which
the
pale
man
instantly
gathered
up
he
looked
from
the
money
to
the
man
who
lay
insensible
with
blood
about
his
ear
and
then
from
the
man
to
the
money
then
he
stuffed
some
few
of
the
shillings
into
the
nearest
pocket
and
went
off
with
the
rest
the
fight
rose
and
fell
the
crowd
grew
and
the
blue
light
burned
down
in
twenty
seconds
the
pale
man
was
back
again
he
bent
over
the
bleeding
sailor
thrust
the
rest
of
the
silver
into
the
pocket
and
finally
vanished
into
the
night
for
indeed
though
the
pale
man
was
poor
and
though
he
got
a
living
now
in
a
way
scarce
reputable
yet
he
had
once
kept
a
chandler
shop
he
had
kept
it
till
neither
sand
in
the
sugar
nor
holes
under
the
weights
would
any
longer
induce
it
to
keep
him
and
then
he
had
fallen
wholly
from
respectability
but
he
had
drawn
a
line
he
had
always
drawn
a
line
he
had
never
been
a
thief
and
with
a
little
struggle
he
remembered
it
now
back
in
blue
gate
the
screams
had
ceased
for
on
a
black
stair
a
large
bony
man
shook
a
woman
by
the
throat
so
that
she
could
scream
no
more
he
cursed
in
whispers
and
threatened
her
with
an
end
of
all
noise
if
she
opened
her
mouth
again
ye
stop
out
of
it
all
this
time
he
said
an
when
ye
come
ye
squall
enough
to
bring
the
slops
from
arbour
square
o
o
the
woman
gasped
i
fell
on
it
dan
i
fell
on
it
i
fell
on
it
in
the
dark
there
was
nothing
commoner
in
the
black
streets
about
the
highway
than
the
sight
of
two
or
three
men
linked
by
the
arms
staggering
singing
and
bawling
many
such
parties
went
along
the
highway
that
night
many
turned
up
its
foul
tributaries
some
went
toward
and
over
the
bridge
by
the
lock
that
was
on
the
way
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
but
they
were
become
fewer
and
the
night
noises
of
the
highway
were
somewhat
abated
when
a
party
of
three
emerged
from
the
mouth
of
blue
gate
of
them
that
had
gone
before
the
songs
were
broken
and
the
voices
unmelodious
enough
yet
no
other
song
sung
that
night
in
the
highway
was
so
wild
as
the
song
of
these
men
or
rather
of
two
of
them
who
sang
the
louder
because
of
the
silence
of
the
man
between
them
and
no
other
voices
were
so
as
theirs
the
man
on
the
right
was
large
bony
and
powerful
he
on
the
left
was
shorter
and
less
to
be
noticed
except
that
under
some
rare
and
feeble
lamp
it
might
have
been
perceived
that
his
face
was
an
ugly
one
with
a
broken
nose
but
what
reveller
so
drunk
what
drunkard
so
insensible
what
clod
so
silent
as
the
man
they
dragged
between
them
his
feet
trailed
in
the
mire
and
his
head
hidden
by
a
ragged
hat
hung
forward
on
his
chest
so
they
went
reeling
ever
where
the
shadows
were
thickest
toward
the
bridge
but
in
all
their
reelings
there
was
a
stealthy
hasting
forward
and
an
anxious
outlook
that
went
ill
with
their
song
the
song
itself
void
alike
of
tune
and
jollity
fell
off
altogether
as
they
neared
the
bridge
and
here
they
went
the
quicker
they
turned
down
by
the
bridge
foot
though
not
for
the
reason
the
pale
man
had
two
hours
before
for
now
no
policeman
was
in
sight
and
soon
were
gone
into
the
black
shadow
about
the
it
was
the
deep
of
the
night
and
as
near
quiet
as
the
highway
ever
knew
with
no
more
than
a
cry
here
or
there
a
distant
fiddle
and
the
faint
hum
of
the
wind
in
the
rigging
of
ships
off
in
blue
gate
the
woman
sat
on
the
black
stair
with
her
face
in
her
hands
waiting
for
company
before
returning
to
the
room
where
she
had
fallen
over
something
in
the
dark
chapter
vi
stephen
tale
high
under
the
tiles
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
i
had
at
first
a
night
of
disturbed
sleep
i
was
in
my
old
familiar
cot
which
had
been
brought
during
the
evening
on
a
truck
but
things
were
strange
and
in
particular
my
grandfather
who
slept
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
snored
so
amazingly
and
with
a
sound
so
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
heard
before
that
i
feared
he
must
be
choking
to
death
and
climbed
out
of
bed
once
to
see
there
were
noises
from
without
too
sometimes
of
discordant
singing
sometimes
of
quarrels
and
once
from
a
distance
a
succession
of
dreadful
screams
then
the
old
house
made
curious
sounds
of
its
own
twice
i
was
convinced
of
stealthy
steps
on
the
stair
and
all
night
the
very
walls
creaked
aloud
so
for
long
sleepy
as
i
was
i
dozed
and
started
and
rolled
and
lay
awake
wondering
about
the
little
ship
in
the
and
cripps
and
the
pale
man
and
the
watch
with
the
m
on
it
also
i
considered
again
the
matter
of
my
prayers
which
i
had
already
discussed
with
grandfather
nat
to
his
obvious
perplexity
by
for
i
was
urgent
to
know
if
i
must
now
leave
my
mother
out
and
if
i
might
not
put
my
little
dead
brother
in
being
very
anxious
to
include
them
both
my
grandfather
first
opinion
was
that
it
was
not
the
usual
thing
which
opinion
he
expressed
with
hesitation
and
a
curious
look
of
the
eyes
that
i
wondered
at
but
i
argued
that
god
could
bless
them
just
as
well
in
heaven
as
here
and
grandfather
nat
admitted
that
no
doubt
there
was
something
in
that
whereupon
i
desired
to
know
if
they
would
hear
if
i
said
in
my
prayers
that
i
was
quite
safe
with
him
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
or
if
i
should
rather
ask
god
to
tell
them
and
at
that
my
grandfather
stood
up
and
turned
away
with
a
rub
and
a
pat
on
my
head
toward
his
own
bed
telling
me
to
say
whatever
i
pleased
and
not
to
forget
grandfather
nat
so
that
now
having
said
what
i
pleased
and
having
well
remembered
grandfather
nat
and
slept
and
woke
and
dozed
and
woke
again
i
took
solace
from
his
authority
and
whispered
many
things
to
my
little
dead
brother
whom
i
could
never
play
with
of
the
little
ship
in
the
glass
case
and
the
pictures
and
of
how
i
was
going
to
the
london
dock
and
so
at
last
fell
asleep
soundly
till
morning
grandfather
nat
was
astir
early
and
soon
i
was
looking
from
the
window
by
his
bed
at
the
ships
that
lay
so
thick
in
the
pool
tier
on
tier
below
me
i
could
see
the
water
that
washed
between
the
slimy
piles
on
which
the
house
rested
and
to
the
left
were
the
narrow
stairs
that
terminated
the
passage
at
the
side
several
boats
were
moored
about
these
stairs
and
a
waterman
was
already
looking
out
for
a
fare
out
in
the
pool
certain
other
boats
caught
the
eye
as
they
dodged
about
among
the
colliers
because
each
carried
a
bright
fire
amidships
in
a
brazier
beside
a
man
two
small
barrels
of
beer
and
a
very
large
handbell
the
men
were
purlmen
grandfather
nat
told
me
selling
liquor
hot
beer
chiefly
in
the
cold
mornings
to
the
men
on
the
colliers
or
on
any
other
craft
thereabout
it
struck
me
that
the
one
thing
lacking
for
perfect
bliss
in
most
rowing
boats
was
just
such
a
brazier
of
cosy
fire
as
the
carried
so
that
after
very
little
consideration
i
resolved
that
when
i
grew
up
i
would
not
be
a
sailor
nor
an
nor
any
one
of
a
dozen
other
things
i
had
thought
of
but
a
purlman
the
staircase
would
have
landed
one
direct
into
the
but
for
an
enclosing
door
which
strangers
commonly
mistook
for
that
of
a
cupboard
a
step
as
light
as
mine
was
possibly
a
rarity
on
this
staircase
for
coming
down
before
my
grandfather
i
startled
a
lady
in
the
who
had
been
doing
something
with
a
bottle
which
involved
the
removal
of
the
cork
which
cork
she
snatched
hastily
from
a
shelf
and
replaced
with
no
very
favourable
regard
to
myself
and
straightway
dropped
on
her
knees
and
went
to
work
with
a
brush
and
a
dustpan
she
was
scarce
an
attractive
woman
i
thought
being
rusty
and
bony
and
very
she
swept
the
carpet
and
dusted
the
shelves
with
an
air
of
angry
contempt
for
everything
she
touched
and
i
got
into
the
bar
out
of
her
way
as
soon
as
i
could
the
potman
was
flinging
sawdust
about
the
floor
and
there
in
the
same
corner
sat
the
same
pale
ragged
man
that
was
there
last
night
with
the
same
full
glass
of
liquor
or
one
like
it
by
his
side
like
a
trade
fixture
that
had
been
there
all
night
when
grandfather
nat
appeared
i
learned
the
woman
name
this
here
my
little
grimes
he
said
as
is
goin
to
live
here
a
bit
as
i
mentioned
yesterday
hindeed
said
grimes
with
a
glance
that
made
me
feel
more
contemptible
than
the
humblest
article
she
had
dusted
that
morning
hindeed
then
it
be
more
work
more
pay
kemp
very
well
mum
my
grandfather
replied
if
you
reckon
it
out
more
work
ho
interjected
grimes
who
could
fill
a
misplaced
aspirate
with
subtle
offence
reckon
or
not
i
there
another
bed
to
be
made
an
buttons
to
be
sewed
an
plates
for
to
be
washed
an
dirt
litter
for
to
be
cleared
up
everywhere
to
say
nothink
o
crumbs
which
the
in
the
this
mornin
was
thick
shameful
had
had
biscuits
and
i
felt
a
reprobate
very
well
mum
grandfather
nat
said
peaceably
we
make
out
extry
damages
mum
a
few
days
give
us
an
idea
shall
we
leave
it
a
week
an
see
how
things
go
ham
i
to
consider
that
a
week
notice
captain
kemp
grimes
demanded
with
a
distinct
rise
of
voice
ham
i
or
ham
i
not
notice
my
grandfather
was
puzzled
and
began
to
look
a
trifle
angry
why
damme
who
said
notice
what
because
notice
is
as
easy
give
as
took
kemp
as
i
you
remember
an
slave
i
may
be
though
better
brought
up
than
any
day
but
swore
at
vulgar
i
wo
be
nor
trampled
like
dirt
litter
beneath
the
feet
an
will
not
endure
it
neither
and
with
a
great
toss
of
the
head
grimes
flounced
through
the
staircase
door
and
sniffed
and
bridled
her
way
to
the
upper
rooms
her
exit
relieved
my
mind
first
because
i
had
a
wretched
consciousness
that
i
was
causing
all
the
trouble
and
a
dire
fear
that
grandfather
nat
might
dislike
me
for
it
and
second
because
when
he
looked
angry
i
had
a
fearful
foreboding
vision
of
grimes
being
presently
whirled
round
by
the
ear
and
flung
into
the
street
as
jim
crute
had
been
but
it
was
not
long
ere
i
learned
that
grimes
was
one
of
those
persons
who
grumble
and
clamour
and
bully
at
everything
and
everybody
on
principle
finding
that
with
a
concession
here
and
another
there
it
pays
very
well
on
the
whole
and
so
nag
along
very
comfortably
through
life
as
for
herself
as
i
had
seen
grimes
did
not
lack
the
cunning
to
carry
away
any
fit
of
virtuous
indignation
that
seemed
like
to
push
her
employer
out
of
his
patience
my
grandfather
looked
at
the
bottle
that
grimes
had
recorked
that
rum
shrub
he
said
ai
properly
mixed
it
works
in
the
bottle
when
it
left
standing
an
mounts
to
the
cork
i
notice
it
almost
every
morning
the
day
was
bright
and
i
resigned
myself
with
some
impatience
to
wait
for
an
hour
or
two
till
we
could
set
out
for
the
docks
it
was
a
matter
of
business
my
grandfather
explained
that
he
must
not
leave
the
bar
till
a
fixed
hour
ten
and
soon
i
began
to
make
a
dim
guess
at
the
nature
of
the
business
though
i
guessed
in
all
innocence
and
suspected
not
at
all
contrary
to
my
evening
observation
at
this
early
hour
the
larger
bar
was
mostly
empty
while
the
obscure
compartment
at
the
side
was
in
far
greater
use
than
it
had
been
last
night
four
or
five
visitors
must
have
come
there
one
after
another
perhaps
half
a
dozen
and
they
all
had
things
to
sell
two
had
watches
one
of
them
was
a
woman
one
had
a
locket
and
a
boatswain
silver
call
and
i
think
another
had
some
silver
spoons
grandfather
nat
brought
each
article
into
the
to
examine
and
then
returned
it
to
its
owner
which
behaviour
seemed
to
surprise
none
of
them
as
it
had
surprised
the
man
last
night
so
that
doubtless
he
was
a
stranger
to
those
with
watches
my
grandfather
said
nothing
but
yes
that
seems
all
right
or
yes
it
a
good
enough
watch
no
doubt
but
to
the
man
with
the
locket
and
the
silver
call
he
said
well
if
ever
you
want
to
sell
you
might
get
eight
bob
no
more
and
much
the
same
to
him
with
the
spoons
except
that
he
thought
the
spoons
might
fetch
fifteen
shillings
each
of
the
visitors
went
out
with
no
more
ado
and
as
each
went
the
pale
man
in
the
larger
bar
rose
put
his
drink
safely
on
the
counter
just
beyond
the
partition
and
went
out
too
and
presently
he
came
back
with
no
more
than
a
glance
at
grandfather
nat
took
his
drink
and
sat
down
again
at
ten
my
grandfather
looked
out
of
the
bar
and
said
to
the
pale
man
all
right
drink
up
whereupon
the
pale
man
who
would
have
been
paler
if
his
face
had
been
washed
swallowed
his
drink
at
last
flat
as
it
must
have
been
and
went
out
and
grandfather
nat
went
out
also
by
the
door
into
the
passage
he
was
gone
scarce
two
minutes
and
when
he
returned
he
unlocked
a
drawer
below
the
shelf
on
which
the
little
ship
stood
and
took
from
it
the
cash
box
i
had
seen
last
night
his
back
was
turned
toward
me
and
himself
was
interposed
between
my
eyes
and
the
box
which
he
rested
on
the
shelf
but
i
heard
a
jingling
that
suggested
spoons
so
i
said
did
the
man
go
to
buy
the
spoons
for
you
nat
my
grandfather
looked
round
sharply
with
something
as
near
a
frown
as
he
ever
directed
on
me
then
he
locked
the
box
away
hastily
with
a
gruff
laugh
you
wo
starve
stevy
he
said
as
long
as
wits
finds
victuals
but
see
here
he
went
on
becoming
grave
as
he
sat
and
drew
me
to
his
knee
see
here
stevy
what
you
see
here
my
business
private
business
understand
you
ai
a
are
you
not
a
sneak
i
repudiated
the
suggestion
with
pain
and
scorn
for
i
was
at
least
old
enough
a
boy
to
see
in
sneakery
the
blackest
of
crimes
no
no
that
you
ai
i
know
grandfather
nat
went
on
with
a
pinch
of
my
chin
though
he
still
regarded
me
earnestly
a
plucked
never
a
sneak
but
there
one
thing
for
you
to
remember
stevy
afore
all
your
readin
an
writin
an
lessons
an
what
not
you
must
never
tell
of
anything
you
see
here
not
to
a
soul
that
is
not
about
me
buyin
things
i
very
careful
but
things
do
always
go
right
an
i
might
get
in
trouble
i
a
straight
man
an
i
pay
for
all
i
have
in
any
line
o
trade
i
never
stole
nor
cheated
not
so
much
as
a
farden
all
my
life
nor
ever
bought
anything
as
i
was
stole
see
i
nodded
gravely
i
was
trying
hard
to
understand
the
reason
for
all
this
seriousness
and
secrecy
but
at
any
rate
i
was
resolved
to
be
no
especially
against
grandfather
nat
why
he
went
on
justifying
himself
i
fancy
more
for
his
own
satisfaction
than
for
my
information
why
even
when
it
just
suspicious
i
wo
buy
except
o
course
through
another
party
how
i
guard
myself
stevy
an
every
man
has
a
right
to
buy
a
thing
reasonable
an
sell
at
a
profit
if
he
can
that
plain
trade
yet
nobody
ca
say
truthful
as
he
ever
sold
me
anything
over
that
there
counter
or
anywhere
else
barrin
what
i
have
of
the
brewer
an
what
not
i
may
look
at
a
thing
or
pass
an
opinion
but
what
that
nothin
at
all
but
we
got
to
keep
our
mouths
shut
stevy
for
fear
o
danger
see
you
would
like
poor
old
grandfather
nat
to
be
put
in
gaol
would
ye
the
prospect
was
terrible
and
i
put
my
hands
about
my
neck
and
vowed
i
would
never
whisper
a
word
that
right
stevy
the
old
man
answered
i
know
you
wo
if
you
do
forget
yourself
so
do
do
that
do
take
no
notice
not
even
to
me
there
was
a
knock
at
the
back
door
which
opened
and
disclosed
one
of
the
purlmen
who
had
left
his
boat
in
sight
at
the
stairs
and
wanted
a
quart
of
gin
in
the
large
tin
can
he
brought
with
him
he
was
a
short
fellow
and
he
needed
the
gin
as
i
soon
learned
to
mix
with
his
hot
beer
to
make
the
purl
he
had
a
short
conversation
with
my
grandfather
when
the
gin
was
brought
of
which
i
heard
no
more
than
the
words
high
water
at
twelve
but
as
he
went
down
the
passage
he
turned
and
sang
out
you
got
the
news
course
what
viney
and
marr
the
man
nodded
with
a
click
and
a
twitch
of
the
mouth
then
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
jerked
them
expressively
upward
after
which
he
ejaculated
the
single
word
marr
and
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
by
which
i
understood
him
to
repeat
with
no
waste
of
language
the
story
that
it
was
all
up
with
the
firm
and
the
junior
partner
had
bolted
that
said
grandfather
nat
when
the
man
was
gone
that
bill
stagg
an
he
the
purlman
as
do
come
ashore
to
sleep
sleeps
in
his
boat
winter
an
summer
does
bill
stagg
how
you
like
that
stevy
i
thought
i
should
catch
cold
and
perhaps
tumble
overboard
if
i
had
a
bad
dream
and
i
said
so
ah
well
bill
stagg
do
mind
he
was
aboard
o
me
when
viney
was
my
mate
many
years
ago
an
a
good
too
bill
stagg
he
makes
fast
somewhere
quiet
at
night
an
curls
up
snug
as
a
weevil
mostly
under
the
piles
o
this
here
house
when
the
wind
ai
east
saves
him
rent
ye
see
so
he
does
pretty
well
and
with
that
my
grandfather
put
on
his
coat
and
reached
the
pilot
cap
that
was
his
everyday
wear
chapter
vii
stephen
tale
we
walked
first
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
where
opened
a
wide
picture
of
the
thames
and
all
its
traffic
and
where
the
walls
were
plastered
with
a
dozen
little
bills
each
headed
found
drowned
and
each
with
the
tale
of
some
nameless
corpse
under
the
heading
that
my
boat
stevy
said
my
grandfather
pointing
to
a
little
dinghy
with
a
pair
of
sculls
in
her
our
boat
if
you
like
seeing
as
we
pardners
now
you
shall
do
which
you
like
walk
along
to
the
dock
where
the
sugar
is
or
come
out
in
our
boat
it
was
a
hard
choice
to
make
the
glory
and
delight
of
the
part
ownership
of
a
real
boat
dazzled
me
like
another
sun
in
the
sky
but
i
had
promised
myself
the
docks
and
the
sugar
for
such
a
long
time
so
we
compromised
the
docks
and
the
boat
out
in
the
street
everybody
seemed
to
know
grandfather
nat
those
who
spoke
with
him
commonly
called
him
captain
kemp
except
a
few
old
acquaintances
to
whom
he
was
captain
nat
loafers
and
crimps
gazed
after
him
and
nodded
together
and
small
gave
him
good
morning
from
their
a
hundred
yards
from
the
hole
in
the
wall
at
a
turn
there
was
a
swing
bridge
and
a
lock
such
as
we
had
by
the
old
house
in
blackwall
at
the
moment
we
came
in
hail
the
men
were
at
the
winch
and
the
bridge
began
to
part
in
the
middle
for
a
ship
was
about
to
change
berth
to
the
inner
dock
come
stevy
said
my
grandfather
we
take
the
lock
they
open
that
not
afraid
if
i
with
you
are
you
no
i
was
not
afraid
with
grandfather
nat
and
would
not
even
be
carried
though
the
top
of
the
lock
was
not
two
feet
wide
and
was
knotted
broken
and
treacherous
in
surface
and
wholly
unguarded
on
one
side
where
one
looked
plump
down
into
the
foul
and
though
on
the
other
side
there
was
but
a
slack
chain
strung
through
loose
iron
stanchions
that
staggered
in
their
sockets
grandfather
nat
gripped
me
by
the
collar
and
walked
me
before
him
but
relief
tempered
my
triumph
when
i
was
safe
across
my
feet
never
seemed
to
have
twisted
and
slipped
and
stumbled
so
much
before
in
so
short
a
distance
perhaps
because
in
that
same
distance
i
had
never
before
recollected
so
many
tales
of
men
drowned
in
the
docks
by
falling
off
just
such
locks
in
fog
or
by
accidental
slips
a
little
farther
along
and
we
came
upon
ratcliff
highway
i
saw
the
street
then
for
the
first
time
and
in
truth
it
was
very
wonderful
i
think
there
could
never
have
been
another
street
in
this
country
at
once
so
foul
and
so
picturesque
as
ratcliff
highway
at
the
time
i
speak
of
much
that
i
saw
i
could
not
understand
child
as
i
was
and
by
so
much
the
more
was
i
pleased
with
it
all
when
perhaps
i
should
have
been
shocked
from
end
to
end
of
the
highway
and
beyond
and
through
all
its
tributaries
and
purlieus
everything
and
everybody
was
for
by
and
of
the
sailor
ashore
every
house
and
shop
was
devoted
to
his
convenience
and
inconvenience
in
the
highway
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
other
house
was
a
tavern
and
in
several
places
two
stood
together
there
were
shops
full
of
slops
tin
pannikins
and
canvas
like
giants
bolsters
and
rows
of
big
knives
and
daggers
often
engraved
with
suggestive
maxims
a
flash
of
memory
recalls
the
favourite
never
draw
me
without
cause
never
sheathe
me
without
honour
i
have
since
seen
the
words
cause
and
honour
put
to
uses
less
respectable
the
had
nothing
in
them
that
had
not
come
straight
from
a
ship
sextants
and
boatswain
pipes
being
the
choice
of
the
stock
and
every
shop
almost
had
somewhere
in
its
window
a
selection
of
those
curiosities
that
sailors
make
abroad
and
bring
home
little
mysteriously
erected
inside
bottles
shells
albatross
heads
snouts
and
bottles
full
of
sand
of
different
colours
ingeniously
packed
so
as
to
present
a
figure
or
a
picture
when
viewed
from
without
men
of
a
dozen
nations
were
coming
or
going
in
every
score
of
yards
the
best
dressed
and
the
worst
were
the
negroes
for
the
black
cook
who
was
flush
went
in
for
adornments
that
no
other
would
have
dreamed
of
a
white
shirt
a
flaming
tie
a
black
coat
with
satin
facings
even
a
white
waistcoat
and
a
top
hat
while
the
and
shipless
nigger
was
a
sad
spectacle
indeed
then
there
were
spaniards
swart
fellows
whose
entire
shore
outfit
consisted
commonly
of
a
red
shirt
blue
trousers
anklejacks
with
the
brown
feet
visible
over
them
a
belt
a
big
knife
and
a
pair
of
large
gold
big
swedes
who
were
full
pink
with
sea
and
sun
and
not
brown
or
like
the
rest
slight
malays
lean
spitting
yankees
with
stripes
and
felt
hats
and
oaths
sometimes
a
chinaman
petticoated
dignified
jeered
at
a
lascar
a
greek
a
russian
and
everywhere
the
english
jack
rolling
of
gait
sometimes
from
habit
alone
sometimes
for
mixed
reasons
hard
waistcoatless
with
his
knife
at
his
belt
like
the
rest
but
more
commonly
a
than
one
in
a
sheath
to
me
all
these
strangely
bedight
men
were
matter
of
delight
and
wonder
and
i
guessed
my
hardest
whence
each
had
come
last
what
he
had
brought
in
his
ship
and
what
strange
and
desperate
adventures
he
had
encountered
on
the
way
and
wherever
i
saw
bare
hairy
skin
whether
an
arm
or
the
chest
under
an
open
shirt
there
were
blue
devices
of
ships
of
flags
of
women
of
letters
and
names
grandfather
nat
was
tattooed
like
that
as
i
had
discovered
in
the
morning
when
he
washed
he
had
been
a
fool
to
have
it
done
he
said
as
he
flung
the
soapy
water
out
of
window
into
the
river
and
he
warned
me
that
i
must
be
careful
never
to
make
such
a
mistake
myself
which
made
me
sorry
because
it
seemed
so
gallant
an
embellishment
but
my
grandfather
explained
that
you
could
be
identified
by
at
any
length
of
time
which
might
cause
trouble
i
remembered
that
my
own
father
was
tattooed
with
an
anchor
and
my
mother
name
and
i
hoped
he
would
never
be
identified
if
it
were
as
bad
as
that
in
the
street
stood
and
cans
one
or
two
sailors
were
buying
and
one
or
two
fiddlers
but
mostly
the
customers
were
the
gaudy
women
who
seemed
to
make
a
late
breakfast
in
this
way
some
had
not
stayed
to
perform
a
greater
toilet
than
to
fling
clothes
on
themselves
unhooked
and
awry
and
to
make
a
straggling
knot
of
their
hair
but
the
most
were
brilliant
enough
in
violet
or
scarlet
or
blue
with
hair
oiled
and
crimped
and
hung
in
thick
nets
and
with
bright
handkerchiefs
over
their
shoulders
belcher
yellows
and
kingsmen
and
blue
billies
and
presently
we
came
on
one
who
was
dancing
with
a
sailor
on
the
pavement
to
the
music
of
one
of
the
many
fiddlers
who
picked
up
a
living
hereabouts
and
she
wore
the
regular
dancing
rig
of
the
highway
short
skirts
and
high
red
morocco
boots
with
brass
heels
she
covered
the
buckle
and
with
great
precision
too
a
contrast
with
her
partner
whose
hornpipe
was
unsteady
and
vague
in
the
figures
for
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
begun
early
perhaps
had
not
left
off
all
night
two
more
pairs
of
these
red
morocco
boots
we
saw
at
a
place
next
a
public
house
where
a
shop
front
had
been
cleared
out
to
make
a
dancing
room
with
a
sort
of
communicating
with
the
tavern
and
where
a
flushed
sailor
now
stood
with
a
pot
in
each
hand
roaring
for
a
fiddler
but
if
the
life
and
the
picturesqueness
of
the
highway
in
some
sort
disguised
its
squalor
they
made
the
more
hideously
apparent
the
abomination
of
the
which
opened
filthy
and
menacing
at
every
fifty
yards
as
we
went
the
light
seemed
greyer
the
very
air
thicker
and
fouler
in
these
passages
though
indeed
they
formed
the
residential
part
whereof
the
highway
was
the
the
children
who
ran
and
tumbled
in
these
places
the
boy
of
nine
equally
with
the
infant
crawling
from
doorstep
to
gutter
were
half
naked
shoeless
and
disguised
in
crusted
foulness
so
that
i
remember
them
with
a
certain
sickening
even
in
these
latter
days
when
i
see
no
such
pitiably
neglected
little
wretches
though
i
know
the
dark
parts
of
london
well
enough
at
the
mouth
of
one
of
these
narrow
streets
almost
at
the
beginning
of
the
highway
grandfather
nat
stopped
and
pointed
it
was
a
forbidding
lane
with
forbidding
men
and
women
hanging
about
the
entrance
and
far
up
toward
the
end
there
appeared
to
be
a
crowd
and
a
fight
in
the
midst
whereof
a
man
seemed
to
be
rushing
from
side
to
side
of
the
street
that
the
blue
gate
said
my
grandfather
and
resumed
his
walk
dangerous
he
went
on
the
worst
place
hereabout
perhaps
anywhere
tiger
bay
a
mile
you
must
never
go
near
blue
gate
people
get
murdered
there
stevy
murdered
many
a
man
mostly
nobody
never
knows
pitch
them
in
the
dock
sometimes
sometimes
in
the
river
so
they
washed
away
i
known
taken
to
stairs
at
night
i
gripped
my
grandfather
hand
tighter
and
asked
in
all
innocence
if
we
should
see
any
if
we
kept
watch
out
of
window
that
night
he
laughed
thought
the
chance
scarce
worth
a
sleepless
night
and
went
on
to
tell
me
of
something
else
but
i
overheard
later
in
a
bar
conversation
a
ghastly
tale
of
years
before
of
a
murdered
man
body
that
had
been
dragged
dripping
through
the
streets
at
night
by
two
men
who
supported
its
arms
staggering
and
shouting
and
singing
as
though
the
three
were
merely
drunk
and
how
it
was
dropped
in
panic
ere
it
was
brought
to
the
waterside
because
of
a
collision
with
three
live
sailors
who
really
were
drunk
one
or
two
crimps
carts
came
through
from
the
docks
as
we
walked
drawn
by
sorry
animals
and
piled
high
with
shouting
sailors
and
their
belongings
chief
among
these
the
giant
the
victims
went
to
their
fate
gloriously
enough
hailing
and
chaffing
the
populace
on
the
way
and
singing
each
man
as
he
list
also
we
saw
a
shop
with
a
window
full
of
parrots
and
monkeys
and
a
very
sick
kangaroo
in
a
wooden
cage
being
carried
in
from
a
van
and
so
we
came
to
the
london
dock
at
last
and
there
in
the
stood
more
sugar
than
ever
i
had
dreamed
of
in
my
wildest
visions
thousands
of
barrels
mountains
of
sacks
and
so
many
of
the
bags
were
or
had
got
a
slit
by
accidentally
running
up
against
a
and
so
many
of
the
barrels
were
defective
or
had
stove
themselves
by
perverse
complications
with
a
crowbar
that
the
heavy
brown
moist
stuff
was
lying
in
heaps
and
lumps
everywhere
and
i
supposed
that
it
must
be
called
because
you
could
help
treading
on
it
it
was
while
i
was
absorbed
in
this
delectable
spectacle
that
i
heard
a
strained
little
voice
behind
me
and
turned
to
behold
cripps
greeting
my
grandfather
good
mornin
kemp
sir
said
cripps
i
been
at
the
noo
blue
crosser
the
she
ought
to
be
done
ye
know
an
a
picter
she
make
but
the
skipper
seems
busy
why
there
young
master
stephen
i
do
declare
are
ye
sir
as
he
bent
and
the
nose
neared
i
was
seized
with
a
horrid
fear
that
he
was
going
to
kiss
me
but
he
only
shook
hands
after
all
though
it
was
not
at
all
a
clean
hand
that
he
gave
why
kemp
he
went
on
this
is
what
i
say
a
phenomenal
coincidence
rather
unique
in
fact
why
you
believe
as
i
was
a
thinkin
o
you
not
an
hour
ago
scarcely
now
you
would
thought
that
would
ye
there
was
a
twinkle
in
grandfather
nat
eye
all
depends
he
said
comin
along
from
the
mortuary
i
see
somethink
ah
something
in
the
mortuary
no
doubt
my
grandfather
interrupted
quizzically
well
what
was
in
the
mortuary
i
bet
there
was
a
corpse
in
the
mortuary
quite
correct
kemp
so
there
was
three
of
an
a
very
sad
sight
decimated
kemp
by
the
watery
element
but
it
was
them
i
was
what
it
was
a
corpse
as
reminded
you
of
me
that
rum
then
i
expect
somebody
told
you
some
more
about
viney
and
marr
come
the
latest
about
viney
an
marr
tell
us
about
that
grandfather
nat
was
humorously
bent
on
driving
cripps
from
his
mark
and
cripps
deferred
well
it
certainly
a
topic
he
said
a
universal
topic
crooks
the
done
for
they
say
unsolvent
the
reported
off
prawle
point
in
list
an
they
say
as
she
be
sold
up
as
soon
as
she
moored
but
there
she
hypotenused
kemp
pawned
as
you
might
say
up
the
flue
it
a
matter
o
information
that
she
pawned
up
to
up
to
main
sir
which
reminds
me
speakin
there
a
just
along
by
the
mortuary
ah
no
doubt
grandfather
nat
interrupted
they
must
put
somewhere
any
news
o
the
no
sir
she
ai
reported
not
doo
barbadoes
yet
or
mail
not
in
they
sell
too
but
the
creditors
wo
get
none
of
it
she
hypotenused
as
deep
as
the
other
up
to
her
an
nothin
else
to
sell
so
it
the
opinion
there
wo
be
much
to
divide
marr
absconded
with
the
proceeds
an
as
regards
what
i
was
agoin
to
yes
you
was
goin
to
tell
me
some
more
about
marr
i
expect
my
grandfather
persisted
heard
where
he
gone
cripps
shook
his
head
they
do
seem
likely
to
ketch
nat
some
says
absconded
out
o
the
country
others
says
in
it
nobody
knows
much
consequence
o
viney
doin
all
the
outdoor
business
i
see
once
myself
viney
thinks
gone
abroad
they
say
an
swears
marr
the
party
as
caused
the
unsolvency
bin
of
all
along
bein
in
charge
the
books
an
it
a
fact
kemp
as
you
never
know
what
them
chaps
may
get
up
to
with
the
proceeds
as
charge
o
books
the
paper
full
of
every
week
always
absconding
with
proceeds
an
by
the
way
speakin
o
proceeds
this
time
captain
nat
made
no
interruption
but
listened
with
an
amused
resignation
speakin
o
proceeds
said
cripps
it
was
bein
out
proceeds
as
made
me
think
o
you
as
i
come
along
from
the
mortuary
for
i
see
as
a
bit
o
panel
for
to
paint
a
sign
on
as
ever
i
come
across
it
was
yes
i
know
enough
to
stimilate
you
to
paint
it
fine
only
to
look
at
it
was
it
well
yes
kemp
so
it
was
not
dear
neither
no
not
to
say
dear
seein
prices
is
up
if
i
well
well
prices
be
down
a
bit
soon
said
grandfather
nat
grinning
and
pulling
out
a
sixpence
i
ai
good
for
no
more
than
that
now
anyhow
and
having
passed
over
the
coin
he
took
my
hand
and
turned
away
laughing
and
shaking
his
head
seeing
that
my
grandfather
wanted
his
sign
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
losing
an
opportunity
and
i
said
so
what
he
said
let
him
buy
the
board
why
he
had
half
a
dozen
boards
for
that
sign
half
a
dozen
i
said
six
boards
what
did
he
do
with
them
ate
said
grandfather
nat
and
laughed
the
louder
when
i
stared
chapter
viii
stephen
tale
i
found
it
quite
true
that
one
might
eat
the
loose
sugar
wherever
he
judged
it
clean
enough
as
most
of
it
was
and
nothing
but
grandfather
nat
restraining
hand
postponed
my
first
bilious
attack
thus
it
was
that
i
made
acquaintance
with
the
highway
and
with
the
london
docks
in
their
more
picturesque
days
and
saw
and
delighted
in
a
thousand
things
more
than
i
can
write
port
was
drunk
then
and
hundreds
of
great
pipes
lay
in
rows
on
a
wide
quay
where
men
walked
with
wooden
clubs
whacking
each
pipe
till
the
shive
or
wooden
bung
sprang
into
the
air
to
be
caught
with
a
dexterity
that
pleased
me
like
a
conjuring
trick
and
many
a
thirsty
watching
his
opportunity
would
cut
a
strip
of
bread
from
his
humble
dinner
as
he
strolled
near
a
pipe
and
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
indefinite
empyrean
absently
dip
his
sippet
into
the
as
he
passed
recovering
it
in
a
state
so
wet
and
discoloured
that
its
instant
consumption
was
imperative
and
so
at
last
we
came
away
from
the
docks
by
the
thoroughfare
then
called
tanglefoot
lane
not
that
that
name
or
anything
like
it
was
painted
at
the
corner
but
because
it
was
the
road
commonly
taken
by
visitors
departing
from
the
after
bringing
as
we
passed
blue
gate
on
our
way
home
i
saw
among
those
standing
at
the
corner
a
untidy
woman
talking
to
a
big
man
with
a
face
so
thin
and
mean
that
it
seemed
misplaced
on
such
shoulders
the
woman
was
so
much
like
a
score
of
others
then
in
sight
that
i
should
scarce
have
noted
her
were
it
not
that
she
and
the
man
stopped
their
talk
as
we
passed
with
a
quick
look
first
at
my
grandfather
and
then
one
at
the
other
and
then
the
man
turned
his
back
and
walked
away
presently
the
woman
came
after
us
walking
quickly
glancing
doubtfully
at
grandfather
nat
as
she
passed
and
at
last
after
twice
looking
back
she
turned
and
waited
for
us
to
come
up
beg
pardon
kemp
she
said
in
a
low
but
a
very
thick
voice
but
might
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
sir
my
grandfather
looked
at
her
sharply
well
he
said
what
is
it
in
regards
to
a
man
as
sold
you
a
watch
las
night
no
grandfather
nat
interrupted
with
angry
decision
he
did
beg
pardon
sir
jesso
sir
not
which
i
mean
to
say
sold
it
to
a
man
near
to
your
is
it
brought
true
as
that
party
not
meanin
you
sir
not
but
the
party
in
the
street
near
your
is
it
brought
true
as
that
party
buy
somethink
more
somethink
as
i
need
tell
now
sir
but
somethink
spoke
of
between
that
party
an
the
other
party
i
mean
the
party
as
sold
it
an
do
mean
you
sir
not
it
was
plain
that
the
woman
who
had
begun
in
trepidation
was
confused
and
abashed
the
more
by
the
hard
frown
with
which
captain
nat
regarded
her
the
frown
persisted
for
some
moments
and
then
my
grandfather
said
do
know
what
you
mean
if
somebody
bought
anything
of
a
friend
yours
an
your
friend
wants
to
sell
him
something
else
i
suppose
he
can
take
it
to
him
ca
he
and
if
it
any
value
there
no
reason
he
should
buy
it
so
far
as
i
know
and
grandfather
nat
strode
on
the
woman
murmured
some
sort
of
acknowledgment
and
fell
back
and
in
a
moment
i
had
forgotten
her
though
i
remembered
her
afterward
for
good
reason
enough
in
fact
it
was
no
later
than
that
evening
i
was
sitting
in
the
with
grandfather
nat
who
had
left
the
bar
to
the
care
of
the
potman
my
grandfather
was
smoking
his
pipe
while
i
spelled
and
sought
down
the
narrow
columns
of
for
news
of
my
ship
it
was
my
grandfather
way
to
excuse
himself
from
reading
when
he
could
on
the
plea
of
unsuitable
eyes
though
i
suspect
that
apart
from
his
sight
he
found
reading
a
greater
trouble
than
he
was
pleased
to
own
there
nothing
here
about
the
grandfather
nat
i
said
nothing
anywhere
ah
said
my
grandfather
la
guaira
was
the
last
port
an
we
must
keep
eyes
on
the
list
for
barbadoes
maybe
the
mail
late
most
of
lloyd
messages
came
by
mail
at
that
time
let
see
he
went
on
belize
la
guaira
barbadoes
and
straightway
began
to
figure
out
distances
and
chances
of
wind
grandfather
nat
had
been
considering
whether
or
not
we
should
write
to
my
father
to
tell
him
that
my
mother
was
dead
and
he
judged
that
there
was
little
chance
of
any
letter
reaching
the
on
her
homeward
passage
belize
la
guaira
barbadoes
said
grandfather
nat
musingly
the
rough
reason
thereabout
an
it
odds
she
may
be
blown
out
of
her
course
but
the
mail
he
stopped
and
turned
his
head
there
was
a
sudden
stamp
of
feet
outside
the
door
behind
us
a
low
and
quick
voice
a
heavy
thud
against
the
door
and
then
a
cry
a
dreadful
cry
that
began
like
a
stifled
scream
and
ended
with
a
gurgle
grandfather
nat
reached
the
door
at
a
bound
and
as
he
flung
it
wide
a
man
came
with
it
and
sank
heavily
at
his
feet
head
and
one
shoulder
over
the
threshold
and
an
arm
flung
out
stiffly
so
that
the
old
man
stumbled
across
it
as
he
dashed
at
a
dark
shadow
without
i
was
hard
at
my
grandfather
heels
and
in
a
flash
of
time
i
saw
that
another
man
was
rising
from
over
the
one
on
the
doorsill
but
for
the
stumble
grandfather
nat
would
have
had
him
in
that
moment
check
the
fellow
spun
round
and
dashed
off
striking
one
of
the
great
posts
with
his
shoulder
and
nearly
going
down
with
the
shock
all
was
dark
without
and
what
i
saw
was
merely
confused
by
the
light
from
the
my
grandfather
raised
a
shout
and
rushed
in
the
wake
of
the
fugitive
toward
the
stairs
and
i
too
startled
and
too
excited
to
be
frightened
yet
skipped
over
the
stiff
arm
to
follow
him
at
the
first
step
i
trod
on
some
object
which
i
took
to
be
my
grandfather
snatched
it
up
and
stuffed
it
in
my
jacket
pocket
as
i
ran
several
men
from
the
bar
were
running
in
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
i
could
hear
captain
nat
hallooing
across
the
river
ahoy
came
a
voice
in
reply
what
up
and
i
could
see
the
fire
of
a
coming
in
stop
him
bill
my
grandfather
shouted
stop
him
stabbed
a
man
got
my
boat
and
there
no
sculls
in
this
damned
thing
gone
round
them
barges
and
now
i
could
distinguish
my
grandfather
in
a
boat
paddling
desperately
with
a
stretcher
his
face
and
his
touched
with
the
light
from
the
fire
the
swung
round
and
shot
off
and
presently
other
boats
came
pulling
by
with
shouts
and
questions
then
i
saw
grandfather
nat
a
black
form
merely
climbing
on
a
barge
and
running
and
skipping
along
the
tier
from
one
barge
to
another
calling
and
directing
till
i
could
see
him
no
more
there
were
many
men
on
the
stairs
by
this
time
and
others
came
running
and
jostling
so
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
door
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
get
in
here
for
a
crowd
was
gathering
but
a
man
from
the
bar
who
recognised
me
made
a
way
and
as
soon
as
i
had
pushed
through
the
crowd
of
men
legs
i
saw
that
the
injured
man
was
lying
on
the
floor
tended
by
the
potman
while
cripps
his
face
pallid
under
the
dirt
and
his
nose
a
deadly
lavender
stood
by
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
hands
dangling
aimlessly
the
stabbed
man
lay
with
his
head
on
a
coat
of
my
grandfather
and
he
was
bad
for
a
child
to
look
at
his
face
had
gone
tallowy
his
eyes
which
turned
and
frightened
me
as
i
came
in
were
now
directed
steadily
upward
he
breathed
low
and
quick
and
though
joe
the
potman
pressed
cloths
to
the
wound
in
his
chest
there
was
blood
about
his
lips
and
chin
and
blood
bubbled
dreadfully
in
his
mouth
but
what
startled
me
most
and
what
fixed
my
regard
on
his
face
despite
my
tremors
so
that
i
could
scarce
take
my
eyes
from
it
was
the
fact
that
paleness
and
blood
and
drawn
cheeks
notwithstanding
i
saw
in
him
the
ugly
fellow
who
had
been
in
the
private
compartment
last
night
with
a
watch
to
sell
the
watch
with
an
initial
on
the
back
that
now
lay
in
grandfather
nat
chapter
ix
stephen
tale
somebody
had
gone
for
a
doctor
it
was
said
but
a
doctor
was
not
always
easy
to
find
in
wapping
grimes
who
was
at
some
late
work
upstairs
was
not
disturbed
at
first
by
the
noise
since
excitement
was
not
uncommon
in
the
neighbourhood
but
now
she
came
to
the
stairfoot
door
and
peeped
and
hurried
back
for
myself
i
squeezed
into
a
far
corner
and
stared
a
little
sick
for
there
was
a
deal
of
blood
and
joe
the
potman
was
all
dabbled
like
a
slaughterman
my
grandfather
returned
almost
on
the
doctor
heels
and
with
my
grandfather
were
some
river
police
in
glazed
hats
and
pilot
coats
the
doctor
puffed
and
shook
his
head
called
for
cold
water
and
cloths
and
turpentine
and
milk
cold
water
and
cloths
were
ready
enough
and
turpentine
was
easy
to
get
but
ere
the
milk
came
it
was
useless
the
doctor
shook
his
head
and
puffed
more
than
ever
wiped
his
hands
and
pulled
his
cuffs
down
gingerly
i
could
not
see
the
man
on
the
floor
now
for
the
doctor
was
in
the
way
but
i
heard
him
just
before
the
doctor
stood
up
the
noise
sent
my
neck
cold
at
the
back
though
indeed
it
was
scarce
more
than
the
noise
made
in
emptying
a
large
bottle
by
it
the
doctor
stood
up
and
shook
his
head
gone
he
said
and
i
have
done
more
than
keep
him
alive
a
few
minutes
at
best
it
was
the
lung
and
bad
two
places
have
they
got
the
man
no
said
grandfather
nat
nor
ai
very
likely
i
say
never
saw
him
again
once
he
got
behind
a
tier
o
lighters
waterside
chap
certain
knows
the
river
well
enough
an
these
stairs
i
could
got
that
boat
o
mine
off
quicker
not
myself
ah
said
one
of
the
river
policemen
he
a
waterside
chap
plain
enough
any
other
up
the
street
never
said
nothing
did
he
this
one
he
was
bending
over
the
dead
man
while
the
others
cleared
the
people
back
from
the
door
and
squeezed
cripps
out
among
them
no
not
a
word
answered
joe
the
potman
could
tried
to
nod
once
when
i
spoke
to
but
it
seemed
to
make
bleed
faster
know
him
nat
asked
the
sergeant
no
answered
my
grandfather
i
do
know
him
might
ha
seen
him
hanging
about
but
then
i
see
a
lot
doin
that
i
wondered
if
grandfather
nat
had
already
forgotten
about
the
silver
watch
with
the
m
on
it
or
if
he
had
merely
failed
to
recognise
the
man
but
i
remembered
what
he
had
said
in
the
morning
after
he
had
bought
the
spoons
and
i
reflected
that
i
had
best
hold
my
tongue
and
now
voices
without
made
it
known
that
the
shore
police
were
here
with
a
stretcher
and
presently
with
a
crowding
and
squeezing
in
the
little
that
drove
me
deeper
into
my
corner
and
farther
under
the
shelf
the
uncomely
figure
was
got
from
the
floor
to
the
stretcher
and
so
out
of
the
house
it
was
plain
that
my
grandfather
was
held
in
good
regard
by
the
police
and
i
think
that
his
hint
that
a
drop
of
brandy
was
at
the
service
of
anybody
who
felt
the
job
unpleasant
might
have
been
acted
on
if
there
had
not
been
quite
as
many
present
at
once
when
at
last
they
were
gone
and
the
room
clear
he
kicked
into
a
heap
the
strip
of
carpet
that
the
dead
man
had
lain
on
and
as
he
did
it
he
perceived
me
in
my
corner
what
you
here
all
the
time
stevy
he
said
i
thought
you
gone
upstairs
here
it
ai
right
for
boys
in
general
but
you
got
a
turn
drink
up
this
i
believe
i
must
have
been
pale
and
indeed
i
felt
a
little
sick
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
the
thing
had
been
very
near
and
the
blood
tainted
the
very
air
so
that
i
gulped
the
weak
brandy
and
water
without
much
difficulty
and
felt
better
out
in
the
bar
thin
voice
was
raised
in
thrilling
description
feeling
better
as
i
have
said
and
no
longer
faced
with
the
melancholy
alternatives
of
crying
or
being
ill
i
bethought
me
of
my
you
dropped
your
pouch
nat
i
said
and
i
picked
it
up
when
i
ran
out
and
with
that
i
pulled
out
of
my
jacket
pocket
not
the
pouch
at
all
but
a
stout
buckled
of
about
the
same
size
that
ai
a
pouch
stevy
said
grandfather
nat
an
mine
here
in
my
pocket
show
me
he
opened
the
flap
and
stood
for
a
moment
staring
then
he
looked
up
hastily
turned
his
back
to
the
bar
and
sat
down
whew
stevy
he
said
with
amazement
in
his
eyes
and
the
open
in
his
hand
you
in
luck
luck
my
boy
see
once
more
he
glanced
quickly
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
bar
and
then
took
in
his
fingers
a
folded
bunch
of
paper
and
opened
it
notes
he
said
in
a
low
voice
drawing
me
to
his
side
bank
of
england
notes
every
one
of
fifties
an
twenties
an
tens
an
fives
where
was
it
i
told
him
how
i
had
run
out
at
his
heels
had
trodden
on
the
thing
in
the
dark
and
had
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
supposing
it
to
be
his
old
leather
from
which
he
had
but
just
refilled
his
pipe
and
how
i
had
forgotten
about
it
in
my
excitement
till
the
people
were
gone
and
the
brandy
had
quelled
my
faintness
well
well
commented
grandfather
nat
it
a
wonderful
bit
o
luck
anyhow
this
is
what
the
chap
was
pulling
away
from
him
when
i
opened
the
door
you
can
lay
to
that
an
he
lost
it
when
he
hit
the
post
wager
unless
the
other
pitched
it
away
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
what
that
he
turned
his
head
quickly
that
stairfoot
door
ai
latched
again
stevy
made
me
jump
fancied
it
was
the
other
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
it
would
seem
except
an
old
photograph
it
was
a
faded
yellowish
thing
and
it
represented
a
rather
stout
woman
seated
with
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
at
her
side
both
very
respectably
dressed
in
the
fashion
of
twenty
years
earlier
grandfather
nat
put
it
back
and
slipped
the
into
the
same
that
had
held
the
watch
with
the
m
engraved
on
its
back
the
stairfoot
door
clicked
again
and
my
grandfather
sent
me
to
shut
it
as
i
did
so
i
almost
fancied
i
could
hear
soft
footsteps
ascending
but
then
i
concluded
i
was
mistaken
for
in
a
few
moments
grimes
was
plainly
heard
coming
downstairs
with
an
uncommonly
full
tread
and
presently
she
presented
herself
good
law
kemp
exclaimed
grimes
with
a
hand
clutching
at
her
chest
and
her
breath
a
tumultuous
sigh
good
law
i
am
that
bad
what
with
extry
work
an
keepin
on
late
an
murders
under
my
very
nose
i
can
not
it
no
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
by
the
stairfoot
door
letting
go
her
brush
and
dustpan
with
a
clatter
grandfather
nat
turned
to
get
the
again
head
drooped
faintly
and
her
eyelids
nearly
closed
nevertheless
i
observed
that
the
eyes
under
the
lids
were
very
sharp
indeed
following
my
grandfather
back
and
traversing
the
shelf
where
he
had
left
the
photograph
yet
when
he
brought
the
brandy
he
had
to
rouse
her
by
a
shake
chapter
x
stephen
tale
i
went
to
bed
early
that
night
as
soon
as
grimes
was
gone
in
fact
my
grandfather
had
resolved
that
such
a
late
upsitting
as
last
night
must
be
no
more
than
an
indulgence
once
in
a
way
he
came
up
with
me
bringing
the
to
put
away
in
the
little
against
his
where
it
always
lay
at
night
with
a
pistol
by
its
side
grandfather
nat
peeped
to
see
the
safe
once
more
and
chuckled
as
he
locked
it
away
this
done
he
sat
by
my
side
and
talked
till
i
began
to
fall
asleep
the
talk
was
of
the
and
what
should
be
done
with
the
money
eight
hundred
pounds
was
the
sum
and
two
notes
over
and
i
wondered
why
a
man
with
so
much
money
should
come
the
evening
before
to
sell
his
watch
looks
as
though
the
money
was
his
do
it
commented
grandfather
nat
though
anyhow
it
no
good
to
him
now
you
found
it
an
yours
stevy
i
remembered
certain
lessons
of
my
mother
as
to
one
proper
behaviour
toward
lost
property
and
i
mentioned
them
but
grandfather
nat
clearly
resolved
me
that
this
was
no
case
in
point
it
ca
be
his
because
he
dead
captain
nat
argued
an
if
it
the
other
chap
well
let
him
come
an
ask
for
it
that
fair
enough
you
know
stevy
an
if
he
do
come
it
ai
likely
he
will
is
it
then
it
yours
and
keep
it
to
help
start
you
in
life
when
you
grow
up
i
wo
pay
it
into
the
bank
not
for
a
bit
anyhow
there
numbers
on
bank
notes
an
they
lead
to
trouble
often
but
they
as
good
one
time
as
another
easy
sent
abroad
later
on
or
what
not
so
there
you
are
my
boy
eight
hundred
odd
to
start
you
like
a
gentleman
with
as
much
more
as
grandfather
nat
can
put
to
it
eh
he
kissed
me
and
rubbed
his
hands
in
my
curls
and
i
took
the
occasion
to
communicate
my
decision
as
to
being
a
purlman
grandfather
nat
laughed
and
patted
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
and
for
a
little
i
remembered
no
more
i
awoke
in
an
agony
of
nightmare
the
dead
man
with
blood
streaming
from
mouth
and
eyes
was
dragging
my
grandfather
down
into
the
river
and
my
mother
with
my
little
dead
brother
in
her
arms
called
me
to
throw
out
the
and
save
him
and
throw
i
could
not
for
the
thing
seemed
glued
to
my
fingers
so
i
awoke
with
a
choke
and
a
cry
and
sat
up
in
bed
all
was
quiet
about
me
and
below
were
the
common
evening
noises
of
the
tavern
laughs
argumentation
and
the
gurgle
of
drawn
beer
though
there
was
less
noise
now
than
when
i
had
come
up
and
i
judged
it
not
far
from
closing
time
out
in
the
street
a
woman
was
singing
a
ballad
and
i
got
out
of
bed
and
went
to
the
front
room
window
to
see
and
to
hear
for
indeed
i
was
out
of
sorts
and
nervous
and
wished
to
look
at
people
at
the
corner
of
the
passage
there
was
a
small
group
who
pointed
and
talked
together
plainly
discussing
the
murder
and
as
one
or
two
drifted
away
so
one
or
two
more
came
up
to
join
those
remaining
no
doubt
the
singing
woman
had
taken
this
pitch
as
one
suitable
to
her
ware
for
she
sang
and
fluttered
at
length
in
her
hand
one
of
the
versified
last
dying
confessions
that
even
so
late
as
this
were
hawked
about
ratcliff
and
wapping
what
murderer
confession
the
woman
was
singing
i
have
clean
forgotten
but
they
were
all
the
same
all
set
to
a
doleful
tune
which
with
modifications
still
does
duty
i
believe
as
an
evening
hymn
and
the
burden
ran
thus
for
every
murderer
and
any
murder
take
warning
by
my
dreadful
fate
the
truth
i
ca
deny
this
dreadful
crime
that
i
are
done
i
are
condemned
to
die
the
singular
grammar
of
the
last
two
lines
i
never
quite
understood
not
having
noticed
its
like
elsewhere
but
i
put
it
down
as
a
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
speech
of
murderers
i
waited
till
the
woman
had
taken
her
ballads
away
and
i
had
grown
uncommonly
cold
in
the
legs
and
then
crept
back
to
bed
but
now
i
had
fully
awakened
myself
and
sleep
was
impossible
presently
i
got
up
again
and
looked
out
over
the
river
very
black
and
mysterious
it
lay
the
blacker
it
seemed
for
the
thousand
lights
that
spotted
it
craft
and
shore
no
purlmen
fires
were
to
be
seen
for
work
on
the
colliers
was
done
long
ago
but
once
a
shout
and
now
a
hail
came
over
the
water
faint
or
loud
far
or
near
and
up
the
wooden
wall
i
leaned
on
came
the
steady
sound
of
the
lapping
against
the
piles
below
i
wondered
where
grandfather
nat
boat
our
boat
lay
now
if
the
murderer
were
still
rowing
in
it
and
would
row
and
row
right
away
to
sea
where
my
father
was
in
his
ship
or
if
he
would
be
caught
and
make
a
dying
confession
with
all
the
haves
and
ams
replaced
by
ares
or
if
indeed
he
had
already
met
providential
retribution
by
drowning
in
which
case
i
doubted
for
the
safety
of
the
boat
and
grandfather
would
buy
another
and
my
legs
growing
cold
again
i
retreated
once
more
i
heard
the
customers
being
turned
into
the
street
and
the
shutters
going
up
and
then
i
got
under
the
for
i
recalled
the
nightmare
and
it
was
not
pleasant
it
grew
rather
worse
indeed
for
my
waking
fancy
enlarged
and
embellished
it
and
i
longed
to
hear
the
tread
of
grandfather
nat
ascending
the
stair
but
he
was
late
i
heard
joe
the
potman
who
slept
off
the
premises
shut
the
door
and
go
off
up
the
street
for
a
few
minutes
grandfather
nat
was
moving
about
the
bar
and
the
and
then
there
was
silence
save
for
the
noises
the
clicks
and
the
creaks
that
the
old
house
made
of
itself
i
waited
and
waited
sometimes
with
my
head
out
of
the
clothes
sometimes
with
no
more
than
a
contrived
hole
next
my
ear
listening
till
at
last
i
could
wait
no
longer
for
the
house
seemed
alive
with
stealthy
movement
and
i
shook
with
the
indefinite
terror
that
comes
some
night
or
another
to
the
most
unimaginative
child
i
thought
at
first
of
calling
to
my
grandfather
but
that
would
seem
babyish
so
i
said
my
prayers
over
again
held
my
breath
and
faced
the
terrors
of
the
staircase
the
boards
sang
and
creaked
under
my
bare
feet
and
the
black
about
me
was
full
of
dim
coloured
faces
but
i
pushed
the
door
and
drew
breath
in
the
honest
lamplight
of
the
at
last
nobody
was
there
and
nobody
was
in
the
bar
could
he
have
gone
out
was
i
alone
in
the
house
there
where
the
blood
was
still
on
the
carpet
but
there
was
a
slight
noise
from
behind
the
stairs
and
i
turned
to
look
farther
behind
the
and
the
staircase
were
two
rooms
that
projected
immediately
over
the
river
with
their
frames
resting
on
the
piles
one
was
sometimes
used
as
a
parlour
for
the
reception
of
mates
and
skippers
though
such
customers
were
rare
the
other
held
cases
bottles
and
barrels
to
this
latter
i
turned
and
mounting
the
three
steps
behind
the
staircase
pushed
open
the
door
and
was
mightily
astonished
at
what
i
saw
there
was
my
grandfather
kneeling
and
there
was
one
half
of
bill
stagg
the
purlman
standing
in
the
floor
for
a
moment
it
was
beyond
me
to
guess
what
he
was
standing
on
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
below
but
water
but
presently
i
reasoned
that
the
tide
was
high
and
he
must
be
standing
in
his
boat
he
was
handing
my
grandfather
some
small
packages
and
he
saw
me
at
once
and
pointed
grandfather
nat
turned
sharply
and
stared
and
for
a
moment
i
feared
he
was
angry
then
he
grinned
shook
his
finger
at
me
and
brought
it
back
to
his
lips
with
a
tap
all
right
my
pardner
he
whispered
and
bill
stagg
grinned
too
the
business
was
short
enough
and
in
a
few
seconds
bill
stagg
with
another
grin
at
me
and
something
like
a
wink
ducked
below
my
grandfather
with
noiseless
care
put
back
in
place
a
not
a
square
noticeable
thing
but
a
clump
of
boards
of
divers
lengths
that
fell
into
place
with
as
innocent
an
aspect
as
the
rest
of
the
floor
this
done
he
rolled
a
barrel
over
the
place
and
dropped
the
contents
of
the
packages
into
a
row
of
buckets
that
stood
near
what
that
grandfather
nat
i
ventured
to
ask
when
all
was
safely
accomplished
my
grandfather
grinned
once
more
and
shook
his
head
go
on
he
said
i
tell
you
in
the
may
as
well
now
as
let
ye
find
out
he
blew
out
the
light
of
his
candle
and
followed
me
well
he
said
wrapping
my
cold
feet
in
my
nightgown
as
i
sat
on
his
knee
what
brought
ye
down
stevy
did
we
make
a
noise
i
shook
my
head
i
i
felt
lonely
i
said
lonely
well
never
mind
an
so
ye
came
to
look
for
me
eh
well
now
this
is
another
one
o
the
things
as
you
must
talk
about
stevy
a
little
secret
between
ourselves
bein
pardners
the
stuff
in
the
pail
nat
the
stuff
in
the
pail
an
the
hole
in
the
floor
you
sure
you
get
talkin
an
get
your
poor
old
in
trouble
yes
i
was
quite
sure
though
i
could
not
see
as
yet
what
there
was
to
cause
trouble
the
stuff
bill
stagg
brought
stevy
is
smashed
down
so
hard
that
a
pound
ai
bigger
than
that
matchbox
an
i
pitch
it
in
the
water
to
swell
it
out
again
see
i
still
failed
to
understand
the
method
of
its
arrival
did
bill
stagg
steal
it
i
asked
grandfather
nat
laughed
no
my
boy
he
said
he
bought
it
an
i
buy
it
it
comes
off
the
dutch
boats
but
it
comes
a
deal
cheaper
takin
it
in
that
way
at
there
a
big
place
i
show
you
one
day
stevy
big
white
house
just
this
side
o
london
bridge
there
a
lot
gentlemen
there
as
wants
to
see
all
the
that
comes
in
from
aboard
an
they
take
a
lot
o
trouble
over
it
and
charge
too
fearful
so
they
very
angry
if
parties
same
as
you
an
me
takes
any
in
without
lettin
know
an
payin
the
money
an
they
can
get
you
locked
up
this
seemed
a
very
unjust
world
that
i
had
come
into
in
which
grandfather
nat
was
in
danger
of
such
terrible
penalties
for
such
innocent
transactions
buying
a
watch
or
getting
his
tobacco
cheap
so
i
said
i
think
people
are
very
wicked
in
this
place
ah
said
my
grandfather
i
none
of
us
ai
over
good
but
there
i
told
you
about
it
now
an
that
better
than
lettin
you
wonder
an
go
asking
other
people
questions
so
now
you
know
stevy
we
got
our
little
secrets
between
us
an
you
got
to
keep
between
us
else
well
you
know
nothing
about
anything
i
buy
nor
about
what
i
take
in
with
a
jerk
of
the
thumb
nor
about
in
buckets
o
water
nor
about
the
nat
lord
no
not
about
that
you
see
stevy
pardners
is
pardners
an
they
must
stick
together
eh
we
stick
together
we
i
nodded
hard
and
reached
for
my
grandfather
neck
ah
that
we
will
what
others
like
to
think
they
can
they
ca
prove
nothing
nor
it
would
be
their
game
but
we
pardners
an
told
you
what
well
what
you
might
ha
found
out
in
a
more
awkward
way
an
it
ai
so
bad
a
thing
to
have
a
pardner
to
talk
to
neither
i
never
had
one
till
now
not
since
your
died
that
you
never
saw
stevy
an
that
was
twenty
years
ago
i
been
alone
most
o
my
life
not
even
a
boy
same
as
it
might
be
you
why
when
your
father
was
your
age
an
older
i
was
always
at
sea
an
never
saw
him
scarcely
same
as
him
an
you
now
and
indeed
grandfather
nat
and
i
knew
each
other
better
than
my
father
knew
either
of
us
and
so
we
sat
for
a
few
minutes
talking
of
ourselves
and
once
more
of
the
notes
in
the
upstairs
till
the
tramp
of
the
three
policemen
on
the
beat
stayed
in
the
street
without
and
we
heard
one
of
the
three
coming
down
the
passage
he
knocked
sharply
at
the
door
and
grandfather
nat
put
me
down
and
opened
it
good
evenin
kemp
said
the
policeman
we
knew
you
was
up
seein
a
bit
o
light
then
he
leaned
farther
in
and
in
a
lower
voice
said
he
ai
been
exactly
identified
yet
but
it
thought
some
of
our
chaps
knows
know
if
anything
been
picked
up
my
heart
gave
a
jump
as
probably
did
my
grandfather
picked
up
he
repeated
why
what
what
d
mean
well
there
was
nothing
on
the
body
an
our
chaps
see
the
knife
we
thought
if
anybody
about
picked
up
anything
knife
or
what
not
you
might
so
there
ai
nothing
no
grandfather
nat
answered
blankly
i
seen
no
knife
nor
heard
of
none
all
right
kemp
if
you
do
hear
of
anything
give
us
the
tip
good
night
grandfather
nat
looked
oddly
at
me
and
i
at
him
i
think
we
had
a
feeling
that
our
partnership
was
sealed
and
so
with
no
more
words
we
went
to
bed
chapter
xi
stephen
tale
i
had
never
seen
either
of
the
partners
in
the
firm
of
viney
and
marr
as
i
may
have
said
already
on
the
day
after
the
man
was
stabbed
at
our
side
door
i
saw
them
both
that
morning
the
tide
was
low
and
stairs
ended
in
a
causeway
in
the
midst
of
a
little
flat
of
gravel
and
mud
so
since
the
mud
was
nowhere
dangerous
and
there
was
no
deep
water
to
fall
into
i
was
allowed
to
go
down
the
steps
alone
and
play
on
the
foreshore
while
grandfather
nat
was
busy
with
his
morning
affairs
the
two
or
three
watermen
lying
by
the
causeway
undertaking
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
and
there
i
took
my
pleasure
as
i
would
now
raking
in
the
wet
pebbles
and
heaving
over
big
stones
that
often
pulled
me
on
to
now
climbing
the
stairs
to
peep
along
the
alley
and
once
or
twice
running
as
far
as
the
door
to
report
myself
to
grandfather
nat
and
inform
him
of
my
discoveries
the
little
patch
of
foreshore
soon
rendered
up
all
its
secrets
and
its
area
grew
less
by
reason
of
the
rising
tide
so
that
i
turned
to
other
matters
of
interest
out
in
a
cluster
of
lighters
lay
moored
waiting
for
the
turn
of
the
tide
presently
a
little
tug
came
puffing
and
fussing
from
somewhere
alongshore
and
after
much
shoving
and
hauling
and
shouting
scuffled
off
trailing
three
of
the
lighters
behind
it
from
which
i
conjectured
that
their
loads
were
needed
in
a
hurry
but
the
disturbance
among
the
rest
of
the
lighters
was
not
done
with
when
the
tug
had
cleared
the
three
from
their
midst
for
a
hawser
had
got
foul
of
a
rudder
and
two
or
three
men
were
at
work
with
poles
and
hooks
recrimination
and
forcible
words
to
get
things
clear
though
the
thing
seemed
no
easy
job
and
it
took
my
attention
for
some
time
but
presently
i
tired
of
it
and
climbed
the
steps
to
read
the
bills
describing
the
people
who
had
been
found
drowned
there
were
eleven
of
the
bills
altogether
fresh
and
clean
and
fragments
of
innumerable
others
older
and
dirtier
were
round
about
them
ten
men
and
one
woman
had
been
picked
up
it
would
seem
and
all
within
a
week
or
two
as
i
learned
when
i
had
spelled
out
the
dates
i
pored
at
these
bills
till
i
had
read
them
through
being
horribly
fascinated
by
the
personal
marks
and
peculiarities
so
baldly
set
forth
the
scars
the
tattoo
marks
the
colour
of
the
dead
eyes
the
clothes
and
boots
and
the
contents
of
the
pockets
though
indeed
most
of
the
pockets
would
seem
to
have
been
empty
the
woman
they
guessed
her
age
at
wore
one
earring
and
i
entangled
myself
in
conjectures
as
to
what
had
become
of
the
other
i
was
disturbed
by
a
shout
from
the
causeway
i
looked
and
saw
bill
stagg
in
his
boat
is
your
there
shouted
bill
stagg
tell
him
they
found
his
boat
this
was
joyful
news
and
i
rushed
to
carry
it
they
found
our
boat
grandfather
nat
i
cried
bill
stagg
says
so
grandfather
nat
was
busy
in
the
bar
and
he
received
the
information
with
calmness
ah
he
said
i
knew
it
turn
up
somewhere
bill
stagg
there
and
he
came
out
leisurely
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
galley
found
your
boat
bill
stagg
reported
have
to
go
up
to
the
float
for
it
right
know
where
it
was
up
agin
elephant
stairs
bill
stagg
pointed
across
the
river
turned
adrift
and
jammed
among
the
lighters
grandfather
nat
nodded
serenely
bill
stagg
nodded
in
reply
shoved
off
from
the
causeway
and
went
about
his
business
the
hawser
was
still
foul
among
the
lighters
out
in
the
stream
and
a
man
had
pulled
over
in
a
boat
to
help
i
had
told
grandfather
of
the
difficulty
and
how
long
it
had
baffled
the
lightermen
and
was
asking
the
third
of
a
string
of
questions
about
it
all
when
there
was
a
step
behind
and
a
voice
good
mornin
nat
my
grandfather
turned
quickly
mr
viney
he
said
well
good
mornin
i
turned
also
and
i
was
not
prepossessed
by
viney
his
face
a
face
no
doubt
originally
pale
and
pasty
but
too
long
to
revert
to
anything
but
yellow
in
these
later
years
of
his
yellow
face
was
ever
stretched
in
an
uneasy
grin
a
grin
that
might
mean
either
propitiation
or
malice
and
remained
the
same
for
both
he
had
the
watery
eyes
and
the
goatee
beard
that
were
not
uncommon
among
seamen
and
in
total
i
thought
he
much
resembled
one
of
those
same
fellows
that
stood
at
corners
and
leaned
on
posts
in
the
neighbourhood
making
a
mysterious
living
out
of
sailors
one
of
them
that
is
to
say
in
a
superior
suit
of
clothes
that
seemed
too
good
for
him
i
suppose
he
may
have
been
an
inch
taller
than
grandfather
nat
but
in
the
contrast
between
them
he
seemed
very
small
and
mean
he
offered
his
hand
with
a
stealthy
gesture
rather
as
though
he
were
trying
to
pick
my
grandfather
waistcoat
pocket
so
that
the
old
man
stared
at
the
hand
for
a
moment
as
if
to
see
what
he
would
be
at
before
he
shook
it
down
in
the
world
again
nat
said
viney
with
a
shrug
ay
i
heard
answered
captain
nat
i
very
sorry
but
there
perhaps
you
be
up
again
soon
i
come
to
ask
you
about
something
viney
proceeded
as
they
walked
away
toward
the
door
something
you
tell
me
bein
an
old
shipmate
if
you
can
find
out
i
sure
can
we
go
into
your
place
no
there
a
woman
there
only
one
as
does
washin
up
an
such
i
send
her
upstairs
if
you
like
no
out
here
best
we
walk
up
and
down
people
get
hangin
round
doors
an
keyholes
in
a
place
like
that
here
we
can
see
who
near
us
what
secrets
ay
viney
gave
an
ugly
twist
to
his
grin
i
know
some
o
yours
one
big
un
at
any
rate
nat
do
i
so
i
can
afford
to
let
you
into
a
little
o
mine
seein
i
ca
help
it
now
i
like
to
know
if
you
seen
anything
of
marr
no
have
seen
him
for
months
bolted
they
tell
me
an
well
you
know
me
i
expect
i
do
know
viney
replied
with
emphasis
i
ought
to
know
but
i
do
see
here
now
less
than
a
week
ago
he
cleared
out
an
then
i
filed
my
petition
he
might
ha
been
gone
anywhere
bolted
might
be
abroad
as
would
seem
most
likely
in
plain
fact
he
was
only
coming
down
in
these
parts
to
lie
low
see
round
about
here
a
man
can
lie
low
snug
an
safer
than
abroad
if
he
likes
and
he
had
money
with
him
all
we
could
get
together
see
and
viney
frowned
and
winked
and
glanced
stealthily
over
his
shoulder
ah
remarked
captain
nat
drily
i
see
an
the
creditors
damn
the
creditors
see
here
nat
kemp
remember
a
man
called
dan
webb
captain
nat
paled
a
little
and
tightened
his
lips
remember
a
man
called
dan
webb
viney
repeated
stopping
in
his
walk
and
facing
the
other
with
the
uneasy
grin
unchanged
a
man
called
dan
webb
aboard
o
the
along
o
you
an
me
i
do
anyhow
that
my
little
hint
we
good
friends
altogether
o
course
nat
but
you
know
what
it
means
well
marr
had
money
with
him
as
i
said
he
was
to
come
to
a
quiet
anchorage
hereabout
got
up
like
a
seaman
an
let
me
know
at
once
captain
nat
his
mouth
still
set
tight
nodded
with
a
grunt
well
he
did
let
me
know
i
heard
nothing
at
all
from
him
an
it
struck
me
rather
of
a
heap
to
think
that
he
put
the
double
on
me
an
cleared
out
in
good
earnest
but
yesterday
i
got
news
a
blind
fiddler
chap
gave
me
some
sort
o
news
captain
nat
remembered
the
meeting
at
the
street
corner
in
the
evening
after
the
funeral
blind
george
he
queried
yes
that
was
all
the
name
he
gave
me
a
regular
thick
that
blind
chap
an
a
flow
o
language
as
would
curl
the
sheathing
off
a
bottom
he
came
the
evening
before
it
seems
but
found
the
place
shut
up
servant
gal
took
her
hook
well
now
he
done
all
but
see
marr
down
here
at
the
blue
gate
he
seen
him
as
clear
as
a
blind
man
could
he
said
with
his
ears
an
he
came
to
me
to
give
me
the
tip
an
earn
anything
i
give
him
for
it
it
amounted
to
this
it
was
plain
enough
marr
had
come
along
here
all
right
an
pitched
on
some
sort
quarters
but
it
was
clear
he
was
fit
to
be
trusted
alone
in
such
a
place
at
all
for
the
blind
chap
found
him
drunk
an
in
tow
with
as
precious
a
pair
o
as
blue
gate
could
show
not
only
drunk
neither
but
drunk
with
a
slack
jaw
drunk
an
gabbling
drunk
talkin
business
business
an
lettin
out
all
there
was
to
let
this
an
that
an
an
lord
knows
what
it
was
only
because
of
his
drunken
jabber
that
the
blind
man
found
out
who
he
was
and
this
was
the
day
before
yesterday
asked
captain
nat
yes
captain
nat
shook
his
head
if
he
was
like
that
the
day
before
yesterday
he
said
in
tow
with
such
chaps
as
you
say
well
whatever
he
had
on
him
ai
on
him
now
an
it
puzzle
a
cleverer
man
than
me
to
find
it
you
may
lay
to
that
viney
swore
and
stamped
a
foot
and
swore
again
but
see
he
said
ai
there
a
chance
it
was
in
notes
all
of
it
them
chaps
be
afraid
to
pass
notes
could
most
of
it
be
got
back
on
an
arrangement
to
cash
the
rest
you
can
find
if
you
try
with
all
your
chances
come
i
pay
fair
for
what
i
get
to
you
an
all
see
how
you
left
it
remarked
captain
nat
and
viney
swore
again
this
was
all
done
the
day
before
yesterday
well
you
do
hear
of
it
yourself
till
yesterday
an
now
you
do
come
to
me
till
viney
swore
once
more
and
grinned
twice
as
wide
in
his
rage
yes
he
said
that
was
blind
george
doing
i
sent
him
back
to
see
what
could
do
an
ai
seen
him
since
like
as
not
he
standing
in
with
the
others
ay
that
likely
the
old
man
answered
very
likely
blind
george
is
as
tough
a
lot
as
any
in
blue
gate
for
all
he
blind
you
never
heard
of
it
at
all
if
they
ha
greased
him
a
bit
at
first
i
expect
they
shut
him
out
to
keep
the
plant
to
themselves
an
so
he
came
to
you
for
anything
he
could
pick
up
an
now
viney
cursed
them
all
and
blind
george
and
himself
together
but
most
he
cursed
marr
and
so
talking
the
two
men
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
passage
i
could
see
that
viney
was
angry
and
growing
angrier
still
but
i
gave
all
my
attention
to
the
work
at
the
fouled
hawser
the
man
in
the
boat
working
patiently
with
a
succeeded
suddenly
and
without
warning
so
that
he
almost
pitched
headlong
into
the
river
the
rope
came
up
from
its
entanglement
with
a
spring
and
a
splash
flinging
some
amazing
great
object
up
with
it
half
out
of
water
and
the
men
gave
a
cry
as
this
thing
lapsed
heavily
to
the
surface
the
man
in
the
boat
snatched
his
hook
again
and
reached
for
the
thing
as
it
floated
somebody
threw
him
a
length
of
line
and
with
this
he
made
it
fast
to
his
boat
and
began
pulling
toward
the
stairs
towing
it
i
was
puzzled
to
guess
what
the
object
might
be
it
was
no
part
of
the
lighter
rudder
for
it
lay
in
rather
than
on
the
water
and
it
rolled
and
wallowed
and
seemed
to
tug
heavily
so
that
the
boatman
had
to
pull
his
best
i
wondered
if
he
had
caught
some
curious
a
porpoise
perhaps
or
a
seal
such
as
had
been
flung
ashore
in
a
winter
storm
at
blackwall
a
year
before
viney
and
grandfather
nat
had
turned
their
steps
toward
the
stairs
and
as
they
neared
my
grandfather
lifting
his
eyes
saw
the
boatman
and
his
prize
and
saw
the
watermen
leaving
their
boats
for
the
foreshore
with
a
quick
word
to
viney
he
hastened
down
the
stairs
and
viney
himself
less
interested
followed
half
way
down
and
waited
the
boatman
brought
up
alongside
the
foreshore
and
he
and
another
hauled
at
the
the
thing
in
the
water
came
in
rolling
and
bobbing
growing
more
hideously
distinct
as
it
came
it
checked
at
the
mud
and
stones
turned
over
and
with
another
pull
lay
ashore
staring
and
grey
and
streaming
a
dead
man
the
lips
were
pulled
tight
over
the
teeth
and
the
hair
being
fair
it
was
the
plainer
to
see
that
one
side
of
the
head
and
forehead
was
black
and
open
with
a
great
wound
the
limbs
lay
limp
and
tumbled
all
but
one
leg
fell
aside
with
so
loose
a
twist
that
plainly
it
was
broken
and
i
heard
afterwards
that
it
was
the
leg
that
had
caused
the
difficulty
with
the
hawser
grandfather
nat
down
at
the
waterside
had
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
the
dead
face
than
with
wide
eyes
he
turned
to
viney
and
shouted
the
one
word
look
then
he
went
and
took
another
view
longer
and
closer
and
straightway
came
back
in
six
strides
to
the
stairs
whereon
viney
was
no
longer
standing
but
sitting
his
face
tallowy
and
his
grin
faded
see
him
cried
grandfather
nat
in
a
hushed
voice
see
him
it
marr
himself
if
i
know
him
at
all
come

and
see
viney
pulled
his
arm
from
the
old
man

and
crawled
up
a
stair
or
two

he
said
faintly
i

wo

some
of
them
his
breath
was
short
and
he
gulped

captain
nat
started
at
the
words
and
stood
for
a
moment
staring
eight
hundred
he
repeated
under
his
breath
eight
hundred
an
odd
quid
in
a
leather
ah
and
the
stare
persisted
and
grew
thoughtful
yes

viney

little
more

captain
nat
more
i
ca
if
there
nothing
that
an
end
of
it
he
went
down
to
where
the
men
were
bending
over
the
body
to
disengage
the
he
looked
again
at
the
drawn
face
under
the
gaping
forehead
and
said
something
to
the
men
then
he
bent
and
patted
the
soddened
clothes
now
here
now
there
and
at
last
felt
in
the
meantime
viney
stood
feverishly
on
the
stairs
watching
fidgeting
nervously
down
a
step
and
then
down
another
and
then
down
two
more
and
so
till
captain
nat
returned
the
old
man
shook
his
head
cleaned
out
he
reported
cleaned
out
course
hit
on
the
head
an
cleaned
out
like
many
a
score
better
men
before
him
down
these
parts
not
a
thing
in
the
pockets
anywhere
flimped
clean
viney
eyes
were
wild
nothing
at
all
left
he
said
nothing
of
his
own
not
a
watch
nor
anything
no
not
a
watch
nor
anything
viney
stood
staring
at
space
for
some
moments
murmuring
many
oaths
then
he
asked
suddenly
where
this
blind
chap
where
can
i
find
blind
george
grandfather
nat
shook
his
head
he
all
over
the
neighbourhood
he
answered
try
the
highway
i
ca
give
you
nearer
than
that
and
with
no
more
counsel
to
help
him
viney
was
fain
to
depart
he
went
grinning
and
cursing
up
the
passage
and
so
toward
the
bridge
without
another
word
or
look
and
when
i
turned
to
my
grandfather
i
saw
him
staring
fixedly
at
me
lost
in
thought
and
rubbing
his
hand
up
in
his
hair
behind
through
the
grey
and
out
at
the
brown
on
top
chapter
xii
in
the
by
the
side
of
the
bills
stuck
at
the
corner
of
stairs
the
bills
that
had
so
fascinated
stephen
a
new
one
appeared
with
the
heading
body
found
it
particularised
the
personal
marks
and
description
of
the
unhappy
marr
his
fresh
complexion
his
brown
hair
his
serge
suit
and
his
anklejacks
the
bill
might
have
stood
on
every
wall
in
london
till
it
rotted
and
never
have
given
a
soul
who
knew
him
a
hint
to
guess
the
body
his
except
viney
who
knew
the
fact
already
and
the
body
might
have
been
buried
unidentified
ere
viney
would
have
shown
himself
in
the
business
were
it
not
for
the
interference
of
cripps
for
industry
of
an
unprofitable
kind
was
a
piece
of
nature
and
moreover
he
was
so
regular
a
visitor
at
the
mortuary
as
to
have
grown
an
old
friend
of
the
keeper
his
persistent
prying
among
the
ghastly
at
first
on
plea
of
identifying
a
friend
a
contingency
likely
enough
since
his
acquaintance
was
wide
and
later
under
the
name
of
friendly
calls
was
an
indulgence
that
had
helped
him
to
consideration
as
a
and
twice
had
raised
him
to
the
elevation
of
witness
at
an
inquest
a
distinction
very
gratifying
to
his
simple
vanity
he
entertained
high
hopes
of
being
called
witness
in
the
case
of
the
man
stabbed
at
the
side
door
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
was
scarce
seen
at
captain
nat
all
the
next
day
preferring
to
frequent
the
mortuary
so
it
happened
that
he
saw
the
other
corpse
that
was
carried
thence
from
stairs
there
said
the
there
a
fresh
just
in
from
the
river
unknown
dunno
either
i
expect
but
cripps
was
quite
sure
that
he
did
curious
and
eager
he
walked
up
between
the
two
dead
men
his
grimy
little
body
being
all
that
divided
them
in
this
their
grisly
reunion
i
know
he
insisted
thoughtfully
leastways
i
seen
somewheres
i
sure
the
little
man
gazed
at
the
dreadful
head
and
then
at
the
rafters
then
shut
his
eyes
with
a
squeeze
that
drove
his
nose
into
amazing
lumps
and
wrinkles
then
looked
at
the
head
again
and
squeezed
his
eyelids
together
once
more
and
at
last
started
back
his
eyes
rivalling
his
very
nose
itself
for
prominence
why
he
gasped
it
is
it
is
me
it
marr
as
is
pardners
with
viney
i
see
once
in
my
life
but
i
swear
it
lord
what
a
phenomenal
go
and
with
that
cripps
rushed
off
incontinent
to
spread
the
news
wherever
anybody
would
listen
he
told
the
police
he
told
the
loafers
he
told
captain
nat
and
everybody
in
his
bar
he
told
the
watermen
at
the
stairs
he
shouted
it
to
the
purlmen
in
their
boats
and
he
wriggled
into
conversation
with
perfect
strangers
to
tell
them
too
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
viney
being
called
upon
by
the
coroner
officer
was
fain
to
swallow
his
reluctance
and
come
forward
at
the
inquest
that
was
held
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
hours
after
the
body
had
been
hauled
ashore
the
two
inquests
were
held
together
in
fact
marr
and
that
of
the
man
stabbed
in
the
passage
two
inquests
or
even
three
in
a
day
made
no
uncommon
event
in
those
parts
where
perhaps
a
dozen
might
be
held
in
a
week
mostly
ending
with
the
same
doubtful
verdict
found
drowned
but
here
one
of
the
inquiries
related
to
an
open
and
witnessed
murder
and
that
fact
gave
some
touch
of
added
interest
to
the
proceedings
accordingly
a
drifting
group
hung
about
the
doors
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
at
the
appointed
time
just
such
an
idle
changing
group
as
had
hung
there
all
the
evening
after
the
man
had
been
stabbed
and
in
the
midst
stood
blind
george
with
his
fiddle
his
vacant
white
eye
rolling
upward
his
mouth
full
of
noisy
ribaldry
and
his
fiddle
playing
punctuation
and
chorus
to
all
he
said
or
sang
he
turned
his
ear
at
the
sound
of
many
footsteps
leaving
the
door
near
him
there
they
go
he
sang
out
there
they
go
twelve
on
and
indeed
it
was
the
jury
going
off
to
view
the
bodies
there
they
go
twelve
good
men
an
true
an
bloomin
proud
they
are
to
fancy
it
got
a
copper
for
blind
george
gentlemen
not
a
brown

not
them
not
a
brass
farden
among
the
dam

an
lawful

there
the
good

scales

the
crowner
to

pockets
the
idlers
laughed
and
one
flung
a
copper
which
blind
george
snatched
almost
before
it
had
fallen
ha
ha
he
cried
there
a
toff
somewhere
near
i
can
tell
by
the
sound
of
his
money
here
goes
for
a
stave
and
straightway
be
broke
into
o
they
call
me
hanging
johnny
with
my
hang
boys
hang
the
mortuary
stood
at
no
great
distance
and
soon
the
jury
were
back
in
the
over
the
bar
and
at
work
on
the
first
case
the
police
had
had
some
difficulty
as
to
identification
of
the
stabbed
man
the
difficulty
arose
not
only
because
there
were
no
relations
in
the
neighbourhood
to
feel
the
loss
but
as
much
because
the
persons
able
to
make
the
identification
kept
the
most
distant
possible
terms
with
the
police
and
withheld
information
from
them
as
a
matter
of
principle
albeit
a
reluctant
ruffian
was
laid
hold
of
who
was
induced
sulkily
to
admit
that
he
had
known
the
deceased
to
speak
to
and
lodged
near
him
in
blue
gate
that
the
deceased
was
called
bob
kipps
that
he
was
quite
lately
come
into
the
neighbourhood
and
that
he
had
no
particular
occupation
as
far
as
witness
knew
it
needed
some
pressure
to
extract
the
information
that
kipps
during
the
short
time
he
was
in
blue
gate
chiefly
consorted
with
one
dan
ogle
and
that
witness
had
seen
nothing
of
ogle
that
day
nor
the
day
before
there
was
also
a
woman
called
to
identify
a
woman
more
reluctant
than
the
man
a
woman
of
coarse
features
dull
eyes
tousled
hair
and
thick
voice
sluttish
with
rusty
finery
name
margaret
flynn
though
at
the
back
of
the
little
crowd
that
had
squeezed
into
the
court
she
was
called
musky
mag
it
was
said
there
too
that
mag
in
no
degree
one
of
the
fainting
sort
had
nevertheless
swooned
when
taken
into
the
mortuary
gone
clean
off
with
a
flop
true
she
explained
it
afterward
by
saying
that
she
had
only
expected
to
see
one
body
but
found
herself
brought
face
to
face
with
two
and
of
course
there
was
the
other
there
marr
but
it
was
held
no
such
odds
between
one
corpse
and
two
that
an
like
mag
should
go
on
the
faint
over
it
this
was
reasonable
enough
for
the
crowd
but
not
for
a
woman
who
had
sat
to
drink
with
three
men
and
in
a
short
hour
or
so
had
fallen
over
the
battered
corpse
of
one
of
them
in
the
dark
of
her
room
who
had
been
forced
now
to
view
the
rent
body
of
a
second
and
in
doing
it
to
meet
once
again
the
other
resurrected
bruised
sodden
and
horrible
and
who
knew
that
all
was
the
work
of
the
last
of
the
three
and
that
man
in
peril
of
the
rope
the
man
too
of
all
the
world
in
her
eye
her
evidence
given
with
plain
anxiety
and
a
nervous
unsteadiness
of
the
mouth
added
nothing
to
the
tale
the
man
was
bob
kipps
he
was
a
stranger
till
lately
came
she
had
heard
tell
from
shoreditch
or
hoxton
saw
him
last
a
day
or
two
ago
knew
nothing
of
his
death
beyond
what
she
had
heard
did
not
know
where
dan
ogle
was
this
very
vehemently
with
much
shaking
of
the
head
had
not
seen
him
with
deceased
but
here
the
police
inspector
handed
the
coroner
a
scribbled
note
and
the
coroner
having
read
it
and
passed
it
back
said
no
more
musky
mag
stood
aside
while
the
inspector
tore
the
note
into
small
pieces
and
put
the
pieces
in
his
pocket
nathaniel
kemp
landlord
of
the
house
told
the
story
of
the
murder
as
he
saw
it
and
of
his
chase
of
the
murderer
did
not
know
deceased
and
should
be
unable
to
identify
the
murderer
if
he
met
him
again
having
seen
no
more
than
his
figure
in
the
dark
all
this
time
cripps
had
been
standing
in
eager
trepidation
foremost
among
the
little
crowd
nodding
and
lifting
his
hand
anxiously
strenuous
to
catch
the
coroner
officer
attention
at
the
dismissal
of
each
witness
and
fearful
lest
his
offer
of
evidence
made
a
dozen
times
before
the
coroner
came
should
be
forgotten
now
at
last
the
officer
condescended
to
notice
him
and
being
beckoned
cripps
swaggered
forward
his
greasy
widewake
crushed
under
his
arm
and
his
face
radiant
with
delighted
importance
he
bowed
to
the
coroner
kissed
the
book
with
a
flourish
and
glanced
round
the
court
to
judge
how
much
of
the
due
impression
was
yet
visible
the
coroner
signified
that
he
was
ready
to
hear
whatever
cripps
knew
of
this
matter
cripps
threw
a
chest
stuck
an
arm
akimbo
and
raised
the
other
with
an
oratorical
sweep
so
large
that
his
small
voice
when
it
came
seemed
all
the
smaller
hi
was
in
the
bar
sir
he
piped
the
bar
sir
of
this
bein
long
acquainted
with
an
much
kemp
an
in
the
of
visitin
in
the
intervals
of
the
pursoot
of
my
hart
hem
hi
was
in
the
bar
sir
when
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sudden
noise
or
as
i
may
say
in
the
rear
of
the
hi
was
able
to
distinguish
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
might
be
called
in
a
common
way
o
speakin
a
bump
or
a
bang
sich
as
would
be
occasioned
by
an
unknown
murderer
criminally
shoving
his
victim
agin
the
of
a
hi
was
able
to
distinguish
it
sir
from
a
cry
which
follered
a
cry
or
as
it
might
be
a
holler
sich
as
would
be
occasioned
by
the
victim
shoved
agin
the
aforesaid
genelmen
i
not
a
moment
i
rushed
forward
cripps
paused
so
long
to
give
the
statement
effect
that
the
coroner
lost
patience
yes
he
said
you
rushed
forward
do
you
mean
you
jumped
over
the
bar
for
a
moment
cripps
countenance
fell
truly
it
would
have
been
more
imposing
to
have
jumped
over
the
bar
but
he
was
on
his
oath
and
he
must
do
his
best
with
the
facts
no
sir
he
explained
a
little
tamely
not
over
the
bar
but
reether
the
opposite
way
so
to
speak
towards
the
door
i
rushed
forward
genelmen
in
a
sort
of
rearwards
direction
through
the
door
an
round
into
the
alley
immediate
as
i
turned
the
corner
genelmen
i
with
my
own
eyes
the
unknown
murderer
i
see
from
over
victim
an
i
see
as
the
criminal
tragedy
had
transpired
i
i
rushed
forward
the
sensation
he
looked
for
being
slow
in
coming
another
rush
seemed
expedient
but
it
fell
flat
as
the
first
and
cripps
struggled
on
desperately
conscious
that
he
had
nothing
else
to
say
i
rushed
forward
sir
seein
which
the
miscreant
absconded
absconded
no
doubt
with
with
the
proceeds
an
seein
kemp
after
him
i
turned
an
the
victim
the
corpse
now
in
custody
sir
in
the
an
decimated
i
rushed
forward
it
was
sad
to
see
how
little
the
coroner
was
impressed
there
was
even
something
in
his
face
not
unlike
a
smile
and
cripps
was
at
the
end
of
his
resources
but
if
he
could
have
seen
the
face
of
musky
mag
in
the
little
crowd
behind
him
he
might
have
been
consoled
she
alone
of
all
who
heard
had
followed
his
rhetoric
with
an
agony
of
attention
word
by
word
even
as
she
had
followed
the
earlier
evidence
now
her
strained
face
was
the
easier
merely
by
contrast
with
itself
when
cripps
was
in
full
cry
and
a
moment
later
it
was
tenser
than
ever
yes
yes
cripps
the
coroner
said
no
doubt
you
were
very
active
but
we
do
seem
to
have
increased
the
evidence
you
say
you
saw
the
man
who
stabbed
the
deceased
in
the
passage
did
you
know
him
at
all
ever
see
him
before
here
mayhap
was
some
chance
of
an
effect
after
all
cripps
could
scarce
have
distinguished
the
murderer
from
one
of
the
posts
in
the
alley
but
he
said
with
all
the
significance
he
could
give
the
words
well
sir
i
wo
go
so
far
as
to
swear
to
name
sir
no
sir
not
to
certainly
not
and
therewith
he
made
his
sensation
at
last
bringing
upon
himself
the
eyes
of
the
jury
all
together
the
coroner
looked
up
sharply
oh
he
said
you
know
him
by
sight
then
does
he
belong
to
the
neighbourhood
now
it
was
not
cripps
who
had
said
he
knew
the
murderer
by
sight
but
the
coroner
far
be
it
from
him
thought
the
aspirant
for
fame
to
contradict
the
coroner
and
so
baulk
himself
of
the
credit
thus
thrust
upon
him
so
he
answered
with
the
same
cautious
significance
and
a
succession
of
portentous
nods
your
judgment
sir
is
correct
quite
correct
come
then
this
is
important
you
would
be
able
to
recognise
him
again
of
course
there
was
no
retreat
cripps
was
in
for
it
it
was
an
unforeseen
consequence
of
the
quibble
but
since
plunge
he
must
he
plunged
neck
and
crop
i
know
anywhere
he
said
triumphantly
there
was
an
odd
sound
in
the
crowd
behind
and
a
fall
captain
nat
strode
across
and
the
crowd
wondered
for
musky
mag
had
fainted
again
the
landlord
lifted
her
and
carried
her
to
the
stairs
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
and
the
coroner
officer
had
shouted
the
little
crowd
into
silence
the
inquest
took
a
short
course
to
its
end
cripps
in
the
height
of
his
consequence
began
to
feel
serious
misgivings
as
to
the
issue
of
his
stumble
beyond
the
verities
and
the
coroner
next
words
were
a
relief
i
think
that
will
be
enough
cripps
the
coroner
said
no
doubt
the
police
will
be
glad
of
your
assistance
and
with
that
he
gave
the
jury
the
little
summing
up
that
the
case
needed
there
was
the
medical
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
the
stabbing
and
that
evidence
pointed
to
an
unmistakable
conclusion
nobody
was
in
custody
nor
had
the
murderer
been
positively
identified
and
such
evidence
as
there
was
in
this
respect
was
for
the
consideration
of
the
police
he
thought
the
jury
would
have
no
difficulty
in
arriving
at
a
verdict
the
jury
had
none
and
the
verdict
was
murder
by
some
person
or
persons
unknown
the
other
inquest
gave
even
less
trouble
henry
viney
shipowner
had
seen
the
body
and
identified
it
as
that
of
his
partner
lewis
marr
marr
had
suddenly
disappeared
a
week
ago
and
an
examination
of
his
accounts
showed
serious
defalcations
in
consequence
of
which
witness
had
filed
his
petition
in
bankruptcy
whether
or
not
marr
had
taken
money
with
him
witness
could
not
say
as
deceased
had
entire
charge
of
the
accounts
but
it
seemed
more
likely
that
embezzlement
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
past
and
marr
had
fled
when
detection
could
no
longer
be
averted
this
might
account
for
his
dressing
and
presumably
seeking
work
as
a
sailor
the
divisional
surgeon
of
police
had
examined
the
body
and
found
a
large
wound
on
the
head
fully
sufficient
to
have
caused
death
inflicted
either
by
some
heavy
blunt
instrument
or
by
a
fall
from
a
height
on
a
hard
substance
one
thigh
was
fractured
and
there
were
other
wounds
and
contusions
but
these
as
well
as
the
broken
thigh
were
clearly
caused
after
death
the
blow
on
the
head
might
have
been
caused
by
an
accident
on
the
riverside
or
it
might
have
been
inflicted
wilfully
by
an
assailant
then
there
was
the
evidence
of
the
man
who
had
found
the
body
foul
of
a
rudder
and
a
hawser
and
of
the
police
who
had
found
nothing
on
the
body
and
there
was
no
more
evidence
at
all
the
coroner
having
sympathised
deeply
with
viney
gave
the
jury
the
proper
lead
and
the
jury
with
perfect
propriety
returned
the
open
verdict
that
the
doctor
evidence
and
the
coroner
lead
suggested
the
case
except
for
the
circumstances
of
marr
flight
was
like
a
hundred
others
inquired
upon
thereabout
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
and
in
an
hour
it
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
forgotten
even
by
the
little
crowd
that
clumped
downstairs
to
try
both
cases
all
over
again
in
the
bar
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
to
the
coroner
the
jury
and
the
little
crowd
these
were
two
inquests
with
nothing
to
connect
them
but
the
accident
of
time
and
the
convenience
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
but
blind
george
standing
in
the
street
with
his
fiddle
and
getting
the
news
from
the
in
scraps
between
song
and
patter
knew
more
and
guessed
better
chapter
xiii
stephen
tale
i
found
it
a
busy
morning
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
that
of
the
two
inquests
i
perceived
that
by
some
occult
understanding
business
in
one
department
was
suspended
the
pale
man
idled
without
and
nobody
came
into
the
little
compartment
to
exhibit
valuables
grandfather
nat
had
a
deal
to
do
in
making
ready
the
over
the
bar
and
then
in
attending
the
inquests
and
it
turned
out
that
grimes
had
settled
on
this
day
in
particular
to
perform
a
vast
number
of
extra
feats
of
housewifery
in
the
upper
floors
notwithstanding
the
disturbance
of
this
additional
work
grimes
was
most
amazingly
amiable
even
to
me
but
she
was
so
persistent
in
requiring
first
the
key
of
one
place
then
of
another
next
of
a
chest
of
drawers
and
again
of
a
cupboard
that
at
last
my
grandfather
distractedly
gave
her
the
whole
bunch
and
told
her
not
to
bother
him
any
more
the
bunch
held
all
she
could
require
indeed
i
think
it
comprised
every
key
my
grandfather
had
except
that
of
his
and
she
went
away
with
it
amiable
still
notwithstanding
the
hastiness
of
his
expressions
so
that
i
was
amazed
to
find
grimes
so
meek
and
wondered
vaguely
and
childishly
if
it
were
because
she
felt
ill
and
expected
to
die
shortly
cripps
was
in
the
bar
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
open
in
a
wonderful
state
of
effervescence
he
was
to
make
a
great
figure
at
the
inquest
it
appeared
and
the
pride
and
glory
of
it
kept
him
nervously
on
the
strut
till
the
coroner
came
and
cripps
mounted
to
the
with
the
jury
he
was
got
up
for
his
part
as
completely
as
circumstances
would
allow
grease
was
in
his
hair
his
hat
stood
at
an
angle
and
his
face
exhibited
an
unfamiliar
polish
occasioned
by
a
towel
for
my
own
part
i
sat
in
the
and
amused
myself
as
i
might
blind
george
was
singing
in
the
street
and
now
and
again
i
could
hear
the
guffaw
that
signalised
some
sally
that
had
touched
his
audience
above
things
were
quiet
enough
for
some
while
and
then
my
grandfather
came
heavily
downstairs
carrying
a
woman
who
had
fainted
i
had
not
noticed
the
woman
among
the
people
who
went
up
but
now
grandfather
nat
brought
her
through
the
bar
and
into
the
parlour
and
as
she
lay
on
the
floor
just
as
the
stabbed
man
had
lain
i
recognised
her
face
also
for
she
was
the
woman
who
had
stopped
my
grandfather
near
blue
gate
with
vague
and
timid
questions
when
we
were
on
our
way
from
the
london
dock
grandfather
nat
roared
up
the
little
staircase
for
grimes
and
presently
she
descended
amiable
still
till
she
saw
the
coarse
woman
and
was
asked
to
help
her
she
looked
on
the
woman
with
something
of
surprise
and
something
of
confusion
but
carried
it
off
at
once
with
a
toss
of
the
head
a
high
phrase
or
so
likes
of
respectable
woman
and
a
quick
retreat
upstairs
i
believe
my
grandfather
would
have
brought
her
down
again
by
main
force
but
the
woman
on
the
floor
stirred
and
began
scrambling
up
even
before
she
knew
where
she
was
she
held
the
shelf
and
looked
dully
about
her
with
a
hoarse
beg
pardon
sir
beg
pardon
then
she
went
across
toward
the
door
which
stood
ajar
stared
stupidly
with
a
look
of
some
dawning
alarm
and
said
again
beg
pardon
sir
i
bin
queer
and
with
that
was
gone
into
the
passage
it
was
not
long
after
her
departure
ere
the
business
above
was
over
and
the
people
came
tramping
and
talking
down
into
the
bar
filling
it
close
and
giving
joe
the
potman
all
the
work
he
could
do
the
coroner
came
down
by
our
private
stairs
into
the
ushered
with
great
respect
by
my
grandfather
and
at
his
heels
taking
occasion
by
a
desperately
extemporised
conversation
with
grandfather
nat
came
cripps
there
had
never
been
an
inquest
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
before
and
my
grandfather
had
been
at
some
exercise
of
mind
as
to
the
proper
entertainment
of
the
coroner
he
had
decided
after
consideration
that
the
gentleman
could
scarce
be
offended
at
the
offer
of
a
little
lunch
and
to
that
end
he
had
made
ready
with
a
cold
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
claret
which
grimes
would
presently
be
putting
on
the
table
the
coroner
was
not
offended
but
he
would
take
no
lunch
he
was
very
pleasantly
obliged
by
the
invitation
but
his
lunch
had
been
already
ordered
at
some
distance
and
so
he
shook
hands
with
grandfather
nat
and
went
his
way
a
circumstance
that
had
no
small
effect
on
my
history
for
it
seemed
to
cripps
who
saw
the
coroner
go
that
by
dexterous
management
the
vacant
place
at
our
for
what
the
coroner
would
call
lunch
we
called
dinner
might
fall
to
himself
it
had
happened
once
or
twice
before
on
special
occasions
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
share
a
meal
with
captain
nat
and
now
that
he
was
brushed
and
oiled
for
company
and
had
publicly
distinguished
himself
at
an
inquest
he
was
persuaded
that
the
occasion
was
special
beyond
precedent
and
he
set
about
to
improve
it
with
an
assiduity
and
an
innocent
cunning
that
were
very
transparent
indeed
so
he
was
affectionately
admiring
with
me
deferentially
loquacious
with
my
grandfather
and
very
friendly
with
joe
the
potman
and
grimes
it
was
a
busy
morning
he
observed
and
he
would
be
glad
to
do
anything
to
help
at
that
time
the
houses
on
wapping
wall
were
not
encumbered
with
since
the
river
was
found
a
more
convenient
receptacle
for
rubbish
slops
were
flung
out
of
a
back
window
and
kitchen
refuse
went
the
same
way
or
was
taken
to
the
river
stairs
and
turned
out
either
into
the
water
or
on
the
foreshore
as
the
tide
might
chance
grimes
carried
about
with
her
in
her
dustings
and
sweepings
an
old
which
held
shovels
ashes
cinders
and
the
like
and
at
the
end
of
her
work
when
the
brushes
and
shovels
had
been
put
away
she
carried
the
sometimes
to
the
nearest
window
but
more
often
to
the
river
stairs
and
flung
what
remained
into
the
thames
just
as
cripps
was
at
his
busiest
and
politest
grimes
appeared
with
the
old
piled
uncommonly
high
with
ashes
and
dust
and
she
set
it
down
by
the
door
gave
my
grandfather
his
keys
and
turned
to
prepare
the
table
instantly
cripps
watchful
in
service
pounced
on
the
scuttle
i
pitch
this
away
for
you
mum
he
said
while
you
to
kemp
dinner
and
straightway
started
for
the
stairs
grimes
back
was
turned
at
the
moment
and
this
gave
cripps
the
start
of
a
yard
or
two
but
she
flung
round
and
after
him
like
a
maniac
so
that
both
grandfather
nat
and
i
stared
in
amazement
give
me
that
scuttle
she
cried
snatching
at
the
hinder
handle
mind
your
own
business
an
leave
my
things
alone
cripps
was
amazed
also
and
he
stuttered
i
i
i
drop
it
you
fool
the
woman
hissed
so
suddenly
savage
that
cripps
did
drop
it
with
a
start
that
sent
him
backward
against
a
post
and
the
consequence
was
appalling
cripps
was
carrying
the
by
its
top
handle
and
grimes
reaching
after
it
had
seized
that
at
the
back
so
that
when
cripps
let
go
everything
in
the
scuttle
shot
out
on
the
first
of
course
the
ashes
and
the
then
on
the
top
of
them
crowning
the
heap
grandfather
nat
i
suppose
my
grandfather
must
have
recovered
from
his
astonishment
first
for
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
that
he
had
grimes
back
in
the
held
fast
by
the
arm
while
he
carried
his
in
the
disengaged
hand
cripps
followed
bewildered
but
curious
and
my
grandfather
pushing
his
prisoner
into
a
far
corner
turned
and
locked
the
door
grimes
who
had
been
crimson
was
now
white
but
more
it
seemed
to
me
with
fury
than
with
fear
my
grandfather
took
the
key
from
his
watchguard
and
opened
the
box
holding
it
where
the
contents
were
visible
to
none
but
himself
he
gave
no
more
than
a
quick
glance
within
and
it
from
which
i
judged
and
judged
aright
that
the
was
safe
there
witnesses
enough
here
said
my
grandfather
for
joe
the
potman
was
now
staring
in
from
the
bar
to
give
you
a
good
dose
gaol
mum
o
which
i
pay
your
full
week
money
and
send
you
packin
he
pulled
out
some
silver
from
his
pocket
grateful
or
not
to
me
do
matter
but
i
hope
you
be
honest
where
you
go
next
for
your
own
sake
grateful
honest
grimes
gasped
shaking
with
passion
talk
honest
take
me
to
the
station
now
and
bring
that
box
an
show
inside
it
go
on
i
felt
more
than
a
little
alarmed
at
this
challenge
having
regard
to
the
history
of
the
and
i
remembered
the
night
when
we
first
examined
it
the
creaking
door
and
the
soft
sounds
on
the
stairs
but
grandfather
nat
was
wholly
undisturbed
he
counted
over
the
money
calmly
and
pushed
it
across
the
little
table
there
it
is
mum
he
said
an
there
your
bonnet
an
shawl
in
the
corner
there
nothing
else
o
yours
in
the
place
i
believe
so
there
no
need
for
you
to
go
out
o
my
sight
till
you
go
out
of
it
altogether
that
you
better
do
quick
i
lay
the
dinner
myself
grimes
swept
up
the
money
and
began
fixing
her
bonnet
on
her
head
and
tying
the
strings
under
her
chin
with
savage
jerks
and
a
great
play
of
elbow
her
lips
screwing
nervously
and
her
eyes
blazing
with
spite
ho
yus
she
broke
out
though
her
rage
was
choking
her
as
she
snatched
her
shawl
ho
yus
a
nice
pusson
nat
kemp
to
talk
about
honesty
an
gratefulness
a
nice
pusson
a
nice
teacher
for
young
master
i
must
say
an
do
ye
credit
it
ai
the
last
you
see
o
me
captain
nat
kemp
get
out
o
my
way
you
old
lickspittle
cripps
got
out
of
it
with
something
like
a
bound
and
grimes
was
gone
with
a
flounce
and
a
slam
of
the
door
scold
as
she
was
and
furious
as
she
was
i
was
conscious
that
something
in
my
grandfather
scowl
had
kept
her
speech
within
bounds
and
shortened
her
clamour
for
few
cared
to
face
captain
nat
anger
but
with
the
slam
of
the
door
the
scowl
broke
and
he
laughed
come
he
said
that
well
over
an
i
owe
you
a
turn
cripps
though
you
were
intending
it
stop
an
have
a
bit
of
dinner
and
if
you
like
something
on
account
to
buy
the
board
for
the
sign
or
say
two
boards
if
you
like
we
see
about
it
after
dinner
it
will
be
perceived
that
grandfather
nat
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
keeping
of
his
key
on
his
watchguard
for
had
it
been
with
the
rest
in
grimes
hands
she
need
never
have
troubled
to
smuggle
out
the
box
among
the
ashes
since
the
was
no
such
awkward
article
and
would
have
gone
in
her
pocket
grimes
had
taken
her
best
chance
and
failed
the
disorders
caused
by
the
inquests
had
left
her
unobserved
the
keys
were
in
her
hands
and
the
was
left
in
the
cupboard
upstairs
but
the
sedulous
cripps
had
been
her
destruction
as
for
that
artist
he
attained
his
dinner
and
a
few
shillings
under
the
name
of
advance
and
so
was
well
pleased
with
his
morning
work
chapter
xiv
stephen
tale
a
policeman
brought
my
grandfather
a
bill
which
was
stuck
against
the
bar
window
with
gelatines
and
just
such
another
bill
was
posted
on
the
wall
at
the
head
of
stairs
above
the
smaller
bills
that
advertised
the
found
bodies
this
new
bill
was
six
times
the
size
of
those
below
it
was
headed
murder
in
grim
black
capitals
and
it
set
forth
an
offer
of
fifty
pounds
reward
for
information
which
should
lead
to
the
apprehension
of
the
murderer
of
robert
kipps
the
offer
gave
grandfather
nat
occasion
for
much
solemn
banter
of
cripps
banter
which
seemed
to
cause
cripps
a
curious
uneasiness
and
time
and
again
stopped
his
eloquence
in
full
flood
he
had
been
at
the
pains
to
cut
from
newspapers
such
reports
of
the
inquest
as
were
printed
and
though
they
sadly
disappointed
him
by
their
brevity
and
all
but
two
personally
affronted
him
by
disregarding
his
evidence
and
himself
altogether
still
he
made
great
play
with
the
exceptional
two
in
the
bar
but
he
was
quick
to
drop
the
subject
when
captain
nat
urged
him
in
pursuit
of
the
reward
come
my
grandfather
would
say
you
neglecting
your
fortune
you
know
there
fifty
pound
waitin
for
you
to
pick
up
if
you
only
go
an
collar
that
murderer
an
you
know
him
anywhere
whereupon
cripps
would
look
a
little
frightened
and
subside
i
did
not
learn
till
later
how
the
little
painter
vanity
had
pushed
him
over
bounds
at
the
inquest
so
far
that
he
committed
himself
to
an
absolute
recognition
of
the
murderer
the
fact
alarmed
him
not
a
little
on
his
return
to
calmness
and
my
grandfather
who
understood
his
indiscretion
as
well
as
himself
and
enjoyed
its
consequences
in
his
own
grim
way
amused
himself
at
one
vacant
moment
and
another
by
setting
cripps
alarm
astir
again
you
throwing
away
your
luck
he
would
say
perhaps
seein
you
know
him
so
well
by
sight
if
you
too
to
bother
about
fifty
pound
give
some
of
us
poor
a
run
for
it
an
put
us
on
to
him
i
wish
i
been
able
to
see
him
so
clear
for
in
truth
grandfather
nat
well
knew
that
nobody
had
had
so
near
a
chance
of
seeing
the
face
as
himself
and
that
cripps
at
the
top
of
the
passage
perhaps
even
round
the
corner
had
no
chance
at
all
it
was
because
of
cripps
indiscretion
in
fact
this
i
learned
later
still
that
the
police
were
put
off
the
track
of
the
real
criminal
for
after
due
reflection
on
the
direful
complications
whereinto
his
lapse
promised
to
fling
him
that
distinguished
witness
as
i
have
already
hinted
fell
into
a
sad
funk
so
though
he
needs
must
hold
to
the
tale
that
he
knew
the
man
by
sight
and
could
recognise
him
again
he
resolved
that
come
what
might
he
would
identify
nobody
and
so
keep
clear
of
further
entanglements
now
the
police
suspicions
fell
shrewdly
on
dan
ogle
a
notorious
ruffian
of
the
neighbourhood
he
had
been
much
in
company
of
the
murdered
man
of
late
and
now
was
suddenly
gone
from
his
accustomed
haunts
moreover
there
was
the
plain
agitation
of
the
woman
he
consorted
with
musky
mag
at
the
inquest
she
had
fainted
indeed
when
cripps
had
been
so
positive
about
identifying
the
murderer
these
things
were
nothing
of
evidence
it
was
true
for
that
they
must
depend
on
the
witness
who
saw
the
fellow
face
knew
him
by
sight
and
could
identify
him
but
when
they
came
to
this
witness
with
their
inquiries
and
suggestions
the
thing
went
overboard
at
a
breath
was
the
assassin
a
tall
man
not
at
all
rather
short
in
fact
was
he
a
bony
fellow
on
the
contrary
he
was
fat
rather
than
bony
did
cripps
ever
happen
to
have
seen
a
man
called
dan
ogle
and
was
this
man
at
all
like
him
cripps
had
been
familiar
with
dan
ogle
appearance
from
his
youth
up
this
was
true
for
the
painter
acquaintance
was
wide
and
diverse
but
the
man
who
killed
bob
kipps
was
as
unlike
him
as
it
was
possible
for
any
creature
on
two
legs
to
be
then
would
cripps
if
the
thing
came
to
trial
swear
that
the
man
he
saw
was
not
dan
ogle
cripps
was
most
fervently
and
desperately
ready
and
anxious
to
swear
that
it
was
not
and
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
dan
ogle
or
anybody
like
him
this
brought
the
police
inquiries
to
a
fault
even
had
their
suspicions
been
stronger
and
better
supported
it
would
have
been
useless
to
arrest
dan
ogle
supposing
they
could
find
him
for
this
the
sole
possible
witness
to
identity
would
swear
him
innocent
so
they
turned
their
inquiries
to
fresh
quarters
looking
among
the
waterside
population
across
the
river
since
it
was
plain
that
the
murderer
had
rowed
over
for
recent
immigrants
from
wapping
for
a
little
while
cripps
was
vexed
and
disquieted
with
invitations
to
go
with
a
policeman
and
take
a
quiet
look
at
some
doubtful
characters
but
of
course
with
no
result
beyond
the
welcome
one
of
an
occasional
free
drink
ordered
as
an
excuse
for
waiting
at
bars
and
and
in
time
these
attentions
ceased
for
the
police
were
reduced
to
waiting
for
evidence
to
turn
up
and
cripps
breathed
freely
once
more
while
dan
ogle
remained
undisturbed
and
justice
was
balked
for
a
while
for
it
turned
out
in
the
end
that
when
the
police
suspected
dan
ogle
they
were
right
and
when
they
went
to
other
conjectures
they
were
wrong
all
this
was
ahead
of
my
knowledge
at
the
moment
however
as
indeed
it
is
somewhat
ahead
of
my
story
and
for
the
while
i
did
no
more
than
wonder
to
see
cripps
abashed
at
an
encouragement
to
earn
fifty
pounds
for
he
seemed
not
a
penny
richer
than
before
and
still
impetrated
odd
coppers
on
account
of
the
signboard
of
promise
once
or
twice
we
saw
viney
and
on
each
occasion
he
borrowed
money
off
grandfather
nat
the
police
were
about
the
house
a
good
deal
at
this
time
because
of
the
murder
or
i
think
he
might
have
come
oftener
the
first
time
he
came
i
heard
him
telling
my
grandfather
that
he
had
got
hold
of
blind
george
that
blind
george
had
told
him
a
good
deal
about
the
missing
money
and
that
with
his
help
he
hoped
for
a
chance
of
saving
some
of
it
he
added
mysteriously
that
it
had
been
nearer
hereabouts
than
you
might
think
at
one
time
a
piece
of
news
that
my
grandfather
received
with
a
proper
appearance
of
surprise
but
was
it
safe
to
confide
in
blind
george
viney
swore
for
answer
and
said
that
the
rascal
had
stipulated
for
such
a
handsome
share
that
it
would
pay
him
to
play
square
on
the
last
of
these
visits
i
again
overheard
some
scraps
of
their
talk
and
this
time
it
was
angrier
i
judged
that
viney
wanted
more
money
than
my
grandfather
was
disposed
to
give
him
they
were
together
in
the
back
room
where
the
boxes
and
bottles
were
the
room
into
which
i
had
seen
bill
stagg
head
and
shoulders
thrust
by
way
of
the
my
grandfather
voice
was
low
and
from
time
to
time
he
seemed
to
be
begging
viney
to
lower
his
so
that
i
wondered
to
find
grandfather
nat
so
mild
since
in
the
bar
he
never
twice
told
a
man
to
lower
his
voice
but
if
once
were
not
enough
flung
him
into
the
street
and
withal
viney
paid
no
heed
but
talked
as
he
would
so
that
i
could
catch
his
phrases
again
and
again
let
them
hush
as
is
afraid
i
ai
he
said
and
again
o
am
i
not
me
it
little
enough
for
me
if
it
does
not
the
rope
anyway
and
later
yes
the
rope
kemp
as
you
know
well
enough
the
rope
at
newgate
gaol
dan
webb
aboard
o
the
the
that
was
piled
up
on
the
little
dingoes
in
broad
day
as
you
was
ordered
o
course
but
that
do
matter
that
what
i
want
now
no
less
think
it
lucky
i
offer
to
pay
back
when
i
get
well
be
sensible
i
friendly
enough
very
well
presently
my
grandfather
blacker
than
common
about
brow
and
eyes
but
a
shade
paler
in
the
cheek
came
into
the
and
opened
the
trade
not
the
one
that
grimes
had
hidden
among
the
cinders
but
a
smaller
one
used
for
gold
and
silver
he
counted
out
a
number
of
sovereigns
twenty
i
believe
put
the
box
away
and
returned
to
the
back
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
with
little
more
talk
viney
was
gone
grandfather
nat
came
into
the
again
and
his
face
cleared
when
he
saw
me
as
it
always
would
no
matter
how
he
had
been
ruffled
he
stood
looking
in
my
face
for
a
little
but
with
the
expression
of
one
whose
mind
is
engaged
elsewhere
then
he
rubbed
his
hand
on
my
head
and
said
abstractedly
and
rather
to
himself
i
fancied
than
to
me
never
mind
stevy
we
got
it
back
beforehand
forty
times
over
a
remark
that
i
thought
over
afterward
in
bed
with
the
reflection
that
forty
times
twenty
was
eight
hundred
but
viney
talk
in
the
back
room
brought
most
oddly
into
my
mind
in
a
way
hard
to
account
for
the
first
question
i
put
to
my
grandfather
after
my
arrival
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
did
you
ever
kill
a
man
grandfather
nat
chapter
xv
stephen
tale
the
repeated
multiplication
of
twenty
by
forty
sent
me
to
sleep
that
night
and
i
woke
with
that
arithmetical
exercise
still
running
in
my
head
a
candle
was
alight
in
the
room
ours
was
one
of
several
houses
in
wapping
wall
without
gas
and
i
peeped
sleepily
over
the
grandfather
nat
was
sitting
with
the
on
his
knees
and
the
open
in
his
hand
he
may
just
have
been
counting
the
notes
over
again
or
not
but
now
he
was
staring
moodily
at
the
photograph
that
lay
with
them
once
or
twice
he
turned
his
eyes
aside
and
then
back
again
to
the
picture
as
though
searching
his
memory
for
some
old
face
then
i
thought
he
would
toss
it
away
as
something
valueless
but
when
his
glance
fell
on
the
fireless
grate
he
returned
the
card
to
its
place
and
locked
the
box
when
the
was
put
away
in
the
little
cupboard
at
his
he
came
across
and
looked
down
at
me
at
first
i
shut
my
eyes
but
peeped
i
found
him
looking
on
me
with
a
troubled
and
thoughtful
face
so
that
presently
i
sat
up
with
a
jump
and
asked
him
what
he
was
thinking
about
fox
sleep
stevy
he
said
with
his
hand
under
my
chin
well
boy
i
was
thinking
about
you
i
was
thinking
it
a
good
job
your
coming
home
soon
stevy
though
i
do
like
parting
with
you
parting
with
me
i
did
not
understand
would
father
be
going
away
again
soon
well
i
dunno
stevy
i
dunno
i
been
thinking
a
lot
just
lately
that
a
fact
this
place
is
good
enough
for
me
but
it
ai
a
good
place
to
bring
up
a
boy
like
you
in
not
to
make
him
the
man
i
want
you
to
be
stevy
somehow
it
did
strike
me
that
way
at
first
though
it
ought
to
ha
done
it
ought
to
ha
done
seein
it
struck
strangers
not
particular
moral
strangers
at
that
he
was
thinking
of
blind
george
and
grimes
though
at
the
moment
i
wondered
if
his
talk
with
viney
had
set
him
doubting
no
stevy
he
resumed
it
ai
giving
you
a
proper
chance
keeping
you
here
you
ca
get
lavender
water
out
o
the
bilge
an
this
the
bilge
of
all
london
i
want
you
to
be
a
better
man
than
me
stevy
i
could
not
imagine
anybody
being
a
better
man
than
grandfather
nat
and
the
prospect
of
leaving
him
oppressed
me
dismally
and
where
was
i
to
go
i
remembered
the
terrible
group
of
aunts
at
my
mother
funeral
and
a
shadowy
fear
that
i
might
be
transferred
to
one
of
those
virtuous
females
perhaps
to
aunt
martha
put
a
weight
on
my
heart
do
send
me
away
nat
i
pleaded
with
something
pulling
at
the
corners
of
my
mouth
i
have
been
a
bad
boy
yet
have
i
he
caught
me
up
and
sat
me
on
his
so
that
my
face
almost
touched
his
and
i
could
see
my
little
white
reflection
in

on
because
o
comin
from
a
wapping
public
like
this
sent
by
a
rough
old
chap
like
me
see
i
thought
very
hard
over
this
view
of
things
which
was
difficult
to
understand
who
should
look
down
on
me
because
of
grandfather
nat
of
whom
i
was
so
fond
and
so
proud
grandfather
nat
who
had
sailed
ships
all
over
the
world
had
seen
storms
and
icebergs
and
wrecks
and
who
was
treated
with
so
much
deference
by
everybody
who
came
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
then
i
thought
again
of
the
aunts
at
the
funeral
and
remembered
how
they
had
tilted
their
chins
at
him
and
i
wondered
with
forebodings
if
people
at
a
boarding
school
were
like
those
aunts
so
i
been
thinking
stevy
i
been
thinking
my
grandfather
went
on
after
a
pause
now
there
the
wharf
on
the
cop
the
gettin
more

gettin
older

like
any

young

care
of
your
own
little
fortune
the
notes
till
you
old
enough
to
have
it
been
thinking
about
that
too
here
he
stood
me
on
my
bed
and
playfully
pushed
me
back
and
forward
by
the
shoulders
i
been
thinking
about
that
an
if
it
was
lyin
loose
in
the
street
i
be
puzzled
clean
to
say
who
really
lost
it
what
with
one
thing
an
another
but
it
in
the
street
an
it
yours
with
no
puzzle
about
it
but
there
lie
down
stevy
an
go
to
sleep
your
old
grandfather
forth
a
parson
eh
comes
o
bein
a
lonely
man
an
nobody
to
talk
to
except
myself
till
you
come
lie
down
an
bother
yourself
we
must
wait
till
your
father
comes
home
we
keep
watch
for
the
in
the
list
she
ought
to
ha
been
reported
at
barbadoes
before
this
an
we
must
run
down
to
blackwall
too
an
see
if
there
any
letters
from
him
so
go
to
sleep
now
stevy
we
settle
it
all
we
settle
it
all
when
your
father
comes
home
so
i
lay
and
dozed
with
words
to
send
me
to
sleep
instead
of
figures
till
they
made
a
tune
and
seemed
to
dance
to
it
when
father
comes
home
when
father
comes
home
we
settle
it
all
when
father
comes
home
and
presently
in
some
unaccountable
way
cripps
came
into
the
dance
with
his
up
to
their
up
to
their
the
wessels
is
deep
in
up
to
their
and
so
i
fell
asleep
wholly
in
the
morning
i
was
astir
early
and
watching
the
boats
and
the
shipping
from
the
bedroom
window
ere
my
grandfather
had
ceased
his
alarming
snore
it
was
half
an
hour
later
and
grandfather
nat
was
busy
with
his
razor
on
the
upper
lip
that
my
cheeks
so
well
remembered
when
we
heard
joe
the
potman
at
the
street
door
whereat
i
took
the
keys
and
ran
down
to
let
him
in
a
feat
which
i
accomplished
by
aid
of
a
pair
of
steps
much
tugging
at
heavy
bolts
and
a
supreme
wrench
at
the
big
key
joe
brought
in
with
him
every
morning
from
the
early
newsagent
in
cable
street
i
took
the
familiar
journal
at
once
and
dived
into
the
midst
of
its
quaint
narrow
columns
crowded
with
italics
in
hope
of
news
from
barbadoes
for
i
wished
to
find
for
myself
and
run
upstairs
with
a
child
importance
to
tell
grandfather
nat
but
there
was
no
news
from
barbadoes
that
is
there
was
no
news
of
my
ship
the
name
barbadoes
stood
boldly
enough
with
reports
below
it
of
arrivals
and
sailings
and
one
of
an
empty
boat
washed
ashore
but
that
was
all
so
i
sat
where
i
was
content
to
wait
and
to
tell
grandfather
nat
presently
offhand
from
over
my
paper
like
a
politician
in
the
bar
that
there
was
no
news
thus
cutting
the
leaves
with
a
my
mind
on
my
father
voyage
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
not
spell
la
guaira
the
name
of
the
port
his
ship
was
last
reported
from
and
i
turned
the
paper
to
look
for
it
the
name
was
there
with
only
one
message
attached
and
while
i
was
slowly
conning
the
letters
over
for
the
third
time
i
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
familiar
word
beneath
the
name
of
the
herself
and
this
was
the
notice
that
i
read
la
guaira
the
brig
of
london
beecher
from
this
for
barbadoes
foundered
n
of
margarita
total
loss
all
crew
saved
except
first
mate
master
and
crew
landed
margarita
chapter
xvi
stephen
tale
i
can
not
remember
how
i
reached
grandfather
nat
i
must
have
climbed
the
stairs
and
i
fancy
i
ran
into
him
on
the
landing
but
i
only
remember
his
grim
face
oddly
grey
under
the
eyes
as
he
sat
on
his
bed
and
took
the
paper
in
his
hand
i
do
not
know
even
what
i
said
and
i
doubt
if
i
knew
then
the
only
words
present
to
my
mind
were
all
crew
saved
except
first
mate
and
very
likely
that
was
what
i
said
my
grandfather
drew
me
between
his
knees
and
i
stood
with
his
arm
about
me
and
his
bowed
head
against
my
cheek
i
noticed
bemusedly
that
with
his
hair
the
line
between
the
grey
and
the
brown
at
the
back
was
more
distinct
than
common
and
when
there
was
a
sudden
clatter
in
the
bar
below
i
wondered
if
joe
had
smashed
something
or
if
it
were
only
a
tumble
of
the
pewters
so
we
were
for
a
little
and
then
grandfather
nat
stood
up
with
a
sound
between
a
sigh
and
a
gulp
looking
strangely
askant
at
me
as
though
it
surprised
him
to
find
i
was
not
crying
for
my
part
i
was
dimly
perplexed
to
see
that
neither
was
he
though
the
grey
was
still
under
his
eyes
and
his
face
seemed
pinched
and
older
come
stevy
he
said
and
his
voice
was
like
a
groan
we
have
the
house
shut
again
i
can
not
remember
that
he
spoke
to
me
any
more
for
an
hour
except
to
ask
if
i
would
eat
any
breakfast
which
i
did
with
no
great
loss
of
appetite
though
indeed
i
was
trying
very
hard
to
think
hindered
by
an
odd
vacancy
of
mind
that
made
a
little
machine
of
me
breakfast
done
my
grandfather
sent
joe
for
a
cab
to
take
us
to
blackwall
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
unaccustomed
conveyance
and
rather
pleased
when
we
were
ready
to
go
we
found
cripps
and
two
other
regular
frequenters
of
the
bar
waiting
outside
i
think
cripps
meant
to
have
come
forward
with
some
prepared
condolence
but
he
stopped
short
when
he
saw
my
grandfather
face
and
stood
back
with
the
others
the
was
a
wretched
vehicle
reeking
of
strong
tobacco
and
stale
drink
for
half
the
employment
of
such
cabs
as
the
neighbourhood
possessed
was
to
carry
drunken
sailors
flush
of
money
who
took
bottles
and
pipes
with
them
everywhere
whether
it
was
the
jolting
of
the
cab
wapping
streets
were
paved
with
cobbles
that
shook
my
faculties
into
place
whether
it
was
the
association
of
the
cab
and
the
journey
to
blackwall
that
reminded
me
of
my
mother
funeral
or
whether
it
was
the
mere
lapse
of
a
little
time
i
can
not
tell
but
as
we
went
the
meaning
of
the
morning
news
grew
on
me
and
i
realised
that
my
father
was
actually
dead
drowned
in
the
sea
and
that
i
was
wholly
an
orphan
and
it
struck
me
with
a
sense
of
that
the
fact
afflicted
me
no
more
than
it
did
when
my
mother
and
my
little
brother
had
died
i
had
cried
myself
sodden
and
faint
but
now
heavy
of
heart
as
i
was
i
felt
curiously
ashamed
that
grandfather
nat
should
see
me
tearless
true
i
had
seen
very
little
of
my
father
but
when
he
was
at
home
he
was
always
as
kind
to
me
as
grandfather
nat
himself
and
led
me
about
with
him
everywhere
and
last
voyage
he
had
brought
me
a
little
boomerang
and
only
laughed
when
i
hove
it
through
a
window
that
cost
him
three
shillings
thus
i
pondered
blinkingly
in
the
cab
and
i
set
down
my
calmness
to
the
reflection
that
my
mother
would
have
him
always
with
her
now
and
be
all
the
happier
in
heaven
for
it
for
she
always
cried
when
he
went
to
sea
so
at
last
we
came
in
sight
of
the
old
quay
and
had
to
wait
till
the
bridge
should
swing
behind
a
ship
with
her
bulwarks
patched
with
white
plank
and
the
salt
crust
thick
on
her
spars
i
could
see
across
the
lock
the
three
little
front
windows
of
our
house
shut
close
and
dumb
and
i
could
hear
the
quick
chanty
from
the
quay
where
the
capstan
turned
o
i
served
my
time
on
the
black
ball
line
hurrah
for
the
black
ball
line
from
the
south
sea
north
to
the
hurrah
for
the
black
ball
line
and
somehow
with
that
i
cried
at
last
the
ship
passed
in
the
bridge
shut
and
the
foul
old
cab
rattled
till
it
stopped
before
the
door
the
house
had
been
closed
since
my
mother
was
buried
grandfather
nat
paying
the
rent
and
keeping
the
key
on
my
father
behalf
and
now
the
door
opened
with
a
protesting
creak
and
a
shudder
and
the
air
within
was
close
and
musty
there
were
two
letters
on
the
mat
where
they
had
fallen
from
the
and
both
were
from
my
father
as
was
plain
from
the
writing
we
carried
them
into
the
little
parlour
where
last
we
had
sat
with
the
funeral
party
and
my
grandfather
lifted
the
blind
and
flung
open
the
window
then
he
sat
and
put
one
letter
on
each
knee
stevy
he
said
and
again
his
voice
was
like
a
groan
look
at
them
postmarks
ai
one
belize
yes
one
was
belize
the
other
la
guaira
and
both
for
my
mother
ah
one
been
lyin
here
the
other
must
ha
come
yesterday
by
the
same
mail
as
brought
the
news
he
took
the
two
letters
again
turned
them
over
and
over
and
shook
his
head
then
he
replaced
them
on
his
knees
and
rested
his
fists
on
his
thighs
just
above
where
they
lay
i
do
know
as
we
ought
to
open
stevy
he
said
wearily
i
dunno
stevy
i
dunno
he
turned
each
over
once
more
and
shut
his
fists
again
i
dunno
i
dunno
man
an
wife
between
would
do
it
living
stevy
boy
we
take
home
an
burn
but
to
me
the
suggestion
seemed
incomprehensible
even
shocking
i
could
see
no
reason
for
burning
my
father
last
message
home
perhaps
there
a
little
letter
for
me
nat
i
said
he
used
to
put
one
in
sometimes
ca
we
look
and
mother
used
to
read
me
her
letters
too
my
grandfather
sat
back
and
rubbed
his
hand
up
through
his
hair
behind
as
he
would
often
do
when
in
perplexity
at
last
he
said
well
well
it
hard
to
tell
we
should
never
know
what
we
burnt
if
we
did
we
look
stevy
an
i
read
no
further
than
i
need
come
the
belize
letter
first
send
i
ai
doin
wrong
that
all
he
tore
open
the
cover
and
pulled
out
the
sheets
of
flimsy
foreign
holding
them
to
the
light
almost
at
arm
length
as
men
do
and
as
he
read
slowly
as
always
with
a
leathery
forefinger
following
the
line
the
grey
under
the
old
man
eyes
grew
wet
at
last
and
wetter
what
the
letter
said
is
no
matter
here
there
was
talk
of
me
in
it
and
talk
of
my
little
brother
or
sister
as
it
might
have
been
for
all
my
father
could
know
and
again
there
was
the
same
talk
in
the
second
letter
the
one
from
la
guaira
but
in
this
latter
another
letter
was
enclosed
larger
than
that
for
my
mother
which
was
in
fact
uncommonly
short
and
here
where
the
dead
spoke
to
the
dead
no
more
but
to
the
living
was
matter
that
disturbed
my
grandfather
more
than
all
the
rest
the
enclosure
was
not
for
me
as
i
had
hoped
but
for
grandfather
nat
himself
and
it
was
not
a
simple
loose
sheet
folded
in
with
the
rest
but
a
letter
in
its
own
smaller
envelope
close
shut
down
with
the
words
capn
kemp
on
the
face
my
grandfather
read
the
first
few
lines
with
increasing
agitation
and
then
called
me
to
the
window
see
here
stevy
he
said
it
wrote
small
to
get
it
in
an
slow
with
it
read
it
out
quick
as
you
can
and
so
i
read
the
letter
which
i
keep
still
worn
at
the
folds
and
corners
by
the
old
man
pocket
where
he
carried
it
afterward
dear
father
just
a
few
lines
private
hoping
they
find
you
well
this
is
my
hardest
trip
yet
and
the
queerest
and
i
write
in
case
anything
happens
and
i
do
see
you
again
this
is
for
yourself
you
understand
and
i
have
made
it
all
cheerful
to
the
specially
as
she
is
still
off
her
health
no
doubt
father
the
was
not
meant
to
come
home
this
trip
and
if
ever
she
rounds
blackwall
point
again
it
will
be
in
spite
of
the
skipper
he
had
his
first
try
long
enough
back
on
the
voyage
out
and
it
was
then
she
was
meant
to
go
for
she
was
worse
found
than
ever
i
saw
a
ship
even
a
ship
of
viney
and
not
provisioned
for
more
than
half
the
run
out
proper
rations
and
i
say
it
plain
and
will
say
it
as
plain
to
anybody
that
the
vessel
would
have
been
piled
up
or
dropped
under
and
the
insurance
paid
months
before
you
get
this
if
i
had
not
pretty
nigh
mutinied
more
than
once
he
said
he
would
have
me
in
irons
but
he
sha
have
the
chance
if
i
can
help
it
you
know
beecher
four
times
i
reckon
he
has
tried
to
pile
her
up
every
time
in
the
best
weather
and
near
a
safe
port
the
men
would
have
backed
me
right
through
some
of
them
did
but
they
deserted
one
after
another
all
round
the
coast
monte
video
rio
and
bahia
and
small
blame
to
them
and
we
filled
up
with
and
such
the
last
of
the
ten
and
the
boy
went
at
bahia
so
that
now
i
have
no
witness
but
the
second
mate
and
he
is
either
in
it
or
a
fool
i
think
a
fool
but
perhaps
both
not
a
man
to
back
me
else
i
might
have
tried
to
report
or
something
at
belize
though
that
is
a
thing
best
avoided
of
course
no
doubt
he
has
got
his
orders
so
i
am
not
to
blame
him
perhaps
but
i
have
got
no
orders
not
to
lose
the
ship
i
mean
and
so
i
am
doing
my
duty
twice
i
have
come
up
and
took
the
helm
from
him
but
that
was
with
the
english
crew
aboard
he
has
been
quiet
lately
and
perhaps
he
has
given
the
job
up
at
any
rate
i
expect
he
wo
try
to
pile
her
up
again
more
likely
a
quiet
turn
below
with
a
big
auger
he
is
still
mighty
particular
about
the
being
all
right
and
the
falls
clear
etc
if
he
does
it
i
have
a
notion
it
may
be
some
time
when
i
have
turned
in
i
ca
keep
awake
all
watches
and
he
knows
i
am
about
the
only
man
aboard
who
wo
sign
whatever
he
likes
before
a
consul
you
know
what
i
mean
and
you
know
beecher
too
do
tell
the
of
course
say
this
letter
is
about
a
new
berth
or
what
not
no
doubt
it
is
all
right
but
it
came
in
my
head
to
drop
you
a
line
on
the
off
chance
and
a
precious
long
line
i
have
made
of
it
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
affectionate
son
nathaniel
i
am
in
half
a
mind
to
go
ashore
at
barbadoes
and
report
but
perhaps
best
not
that
sort
of
thing
do
do
while
i
read
my
grandfather
had
been
sitting
with
his
head
between
his
hands
and
his
eyes
directed
to
the
floor
so
that
i
could
not
see
his
face
so
he
remained
for
a
little
while
after
i
had
finished
while
i
stood
in
troubled
wonder
then
he
looked
up
his
face
stern
and
hard
beyond
the
common
and
his
was
a
stern
face
at
best
stevy
he
said
do
you
know
what
that
means
that
you
been
i
looked
from
his
face
to
the
letter
and
back
again
it
means
means
i
think
the
skipper
sank
the
ship
on
purpose
it
means
murder
my
boy
that
what
it
means
murder
by
the
law
of
england
castin
away
an
destroyin
that
what
they
call
the
one
thing
though
i
no
an
it
means
prison
though
why
when
a
man
follows
orders
faithful
i
ca
say
but
well
i
know
it
an
if
any
man
loses
his
life
thereby
it
murder
whether
accidental
or
not
murder
an
the
rope
by
the
law
of
england
bitter
well
i
know
that
too
o
bitter
well
i
know
it
he
passed
his
palm
over
his
forehead
and
eyes
and
for
a
moment
was
silent
then
he
struck
the
palm
on
his
knee
and
broke
forth
afresh
murder
by
the
law
of
england
even
if
no
more
than
accident
in
truth
how
much
the
more
then
this
here
when
the
one
man
as
wo
stand
and
see
it
done
goes
down
in
his
berth
o
i
known
that
afore
too
with
a
gimlet
through
the

was
distressed
and
bewildered
as
well
as
alarmed
by
the
old
vehemence
the
captain
i
said
whimpering
again
viney
my
grandfather
shouted
henry

went
on
with
his

down
in
his
hands
and
his
elbows
on
his
knees
lord
i
see
a
lot
of
it
now
it
was
what
they
made
out
o
the
insurance
that
was
to
save
the
firm
an
when
my
boy
put
in
an
stopped
it
all
the
voyage
out
an
more
they
could
hold
on
no
longer
but
plotted
to
get
out
with
what
they
could
lay
hold
of
lord
it
plain
as

he
lowered
his
hands
and
looked
up
stevy
that
money
more
yours
now
than
ever
if
i
ever
had
a
doubt
if
it

belong
to
the
orphan

made
but
there
it
sent
you
boy
sent
you
an
any

after
that
in
a
moment
more
he
was
back
at
his
earlier
excitement
but
viney
done

he
said
with
his
fist
extended
before
him

station
and

my

groaned

viney
knows
it
though
it
was
wilful
as
god
my
judge
grandfather
nat
ended
with
a
groan
and
sat
still
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
again
i
remembered
and
now
with
something
of
awe
my
innocent
question
did
you
ever
kill
a
man
grandfather
nat
still
he
sat
motionless
and
silent
till
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
for
in
some
way
i
felt
frightened
so
i
went
timidly
and
put
my
arm
about
his
neck
i
fancied
though
i
was
not
sure
that
i
could
feel
a
tremble
from
his
shoulders
but
he
was
silent
still
nevertheless
i
was
oddly
comforted
by
the
contact
and
presently
like
a
dog
anxious
for
notice
ventured
to
stroke
the
grey
hair
soon
then
he
dropped
his
hands
and
spoke
i
should
ha
said
it
stevy
but
i
all
shook
an
worried
an
i
talked
wild
it
was
no
need
to
say
it
but
there
ai
a
soul
alive
to
speak
to
else
an
somehow
i
talk
as
it
might
be
half
to
myself
but
you
know
what
about
things
i
say
private
things
do
you
remember
he
sat
erect
again
and
raised
a
forefinger
warningly
even
sternly
remember
stevy
but
come
there
things
to
do
give
me
the
letter
we
get
together
any
little
things
to
be
kep
papers
an
what
not
an
take
home
i
have
to
think
about
the
rest
what
best
to
be
done

or
what

chapter
xvii
in
blue
gate
in
her
den
at
the
black
in
blue
gate
musky
mag
lurked
furtive
and
trembling
after
the
inquests
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
where
dan
ogle
might
be
hiding
she
could
not
guess
and
she
was
torn
between
a
hundred
fears
and
perplexities
dan
had
been
seen
and
could
be
identified
of
that
she
was
convinced
and
more
than
convinced
since
she
had
heard
cripps
testimony
moreover
she
well
remembered
at
what
point
in
her
own
evidence
the
had
handed
the
note
to
the
coroner
and
she
was
not
too
stupid
to
guess
the
meaning
of
that
how
could
she
warn
dan
how
help
or
screen
him
how
put
to
act
that
simple
fidelity
that
was
the
sole
virtue
remaining
in
her
all
the
greater
for
the
loss
of
the
rest
she
had
no
money
on
the
other
hand
she
was
confident
that
dan
must
have
with
him
the
whole
full
of
notes
which
had
cost
two
lives
already
and
now
seemed
like
to
cost
the
life
she
would
so
gladly
buy
with
her
own
for
they
had
not
been
found
on
kipps
body
nor
in
any
way
spoken
of
at
the
inquest
but
then
he
might
fear
to
change
them
he
could
scarcely
carry
a
single
one
to
the
receivers
who
knew
him
for
his
haunts
would
be
watched
more
a
reward
was
offered
and
no
receiver
would
be
above
making
an
extra
fifty
pounds
on
the
transaction
for
to
her
tortured
mind
it
seemed
every
moment
more
certain
that
the
cry
was
up
and
not
the
police
alone
but
everybody
else
was
on
the
watch
to
give
the
gallows
its
due
she
was
uneasy
at
having
no
message
doubtless
he
needed
her
help
as
he
had
needed
it
so
often
before
doubtless
he
would
come
for
it
if
he
could
but
that
would
be
to
put
his
head
in
the
noose
how
could
she
reach
him
and
give
it
even
if
she
had
known
where
he
lay
to
go
to
him
would
be
to
lead
the
police
after
her
for
she
had
no
doubt
that
her
own
movements
would
be
watched
she
knew
that
the
boat
wherein
he
had
escaped
had
been
found
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
she
like
others
judged
from
that
that
he
might
be
lurking
in
some
of
the
waterside
rookeries
of
the
south
bank
the
more
as
it
was
the
commonest
device
of
those
wanted
in
ratcliff
or
wapping
to
go
for
a
change
to
rotherhithe
or
bankside
and
for
those
in
a
like
predicament
on
the
southern
shores
to
come
north
in
the
same
way
but
again
to
go
in
search
of
him
were
but
to
share
with
the
police
whatever
luck
might
attend
the
quest
so
that
musky
mag
feared
alike
to
stay
at
home
and
to
go
abroad
longed
to
find
dan
and
feared
it
as
much
wished
to
aid
him
yet
equally
dreaded
that
he
should
come
to
her
or
that
she
should
go
to
him
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
therefore
but
to
wait
and
listen
anxiously
to
listen
for
voices
or
footsteps
even
for
creaks
on
the
stairs
for
a
whistle
without
that
might
be
a
signal
for
an
uproar
or
a
sudden
hush
that
might
announce
the
coming
of
the
police
into
blue
gate
even
for
a
whisper
or
a
scratching
at
door
or
window
wherewith
the
fugitive
might
approach
fearful
lest
the
police
were
there
before
him
but
at
evening
when
the
place
grew
dark
and
the
thickest
of
the
gloom
drew
together
to
make
a
monstrous
shadow
on
the
floor
where
once
she
had
fallen
over
something
in
the
dark
then
she
went
and
sat
on
the
watching
and
dozing
and
waking
in
terror
so
went
a
day
and
a
night
and
another
day
the
corners
of
the
room
grew
dusk
again
and
with
the
afternoon
late
light
the
table
flung
its
shadow
on
that
same
place
on
the
floor
so
that
she
went
and
moved
it
toward
the
wall
as
she
set
it
down
she
started
and
crouched
for
now
at
last
there
was
a
step
on
the
stair
an
unfamiliar
step
a
woman
it
would
seem
and
stealthy
musky
mag
held
by
the
table
and
waited
the
steps
ceased
at
the
landing
and
there
was
a
pause
then
with
no
warning
knock
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
a
head
was
thrust
in
covered
by
an
old
plaid
shawl
a
glance
about
the
room
and
the
rest
of
the
figure
followed
closing
the
door
behind
it
and
the
shawl
being
flung
back
from
over
the
bonnet
there
stood
grimes
rusty
and
bony
and
sour
grimes
screwed
her
red
nose
at
the
woman
before
her
jerked
up
her
crushed
bonnet
and
plucked
her
rusty
skirt
across
her
knees
with
the
proper
virtuous
twitch
then
said
grimes
where
my
brother
dan
for
a
moment
musky
mag
disbelieved
eyes
and
ears
together
the
visit
itself
even
more
than
the
question
amazed
and
bewildered
her
she
had
been
prepared
for
any
visitor
but
this
for
grimes
relationship
to
dan
ogle
was
a
thing
that
exemplary
lady
made
as
close
a
secret
as
she
could
as
in
truth
was
very
natural
she
valued
herself
on
her
respectability
she
was
the
widow
of
a
decent
lighterman
of
a
decent
lightering
and
family
and
she
called
herself
though
she
might
be
scarce
more
than
charwoman
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
she
had
never
acknowledged
her
lawless
brother
when
she
could
in
any
way
avoid
it
and
she
had
indeed
bargained
that
he
should
not
come
near
her
place
of
employment
lest
he
compromise
her
and
so
far
from
seeking
him
out
in
his
lodgings
she
even
had
a
way
of
failing
to
see
him
in
the
street
what
should
she
want
in
blue
gate
at
such
a
time
as
this
asking
thus
urgently
for
her
brother
dan
what
but
the
reward
for
an
instant
mag
fears
revived
with
a
jump
though
even
as
it
came
she
put
away
the
fancy
that
such
might
be
the
design
of
any
sister
however
respectable
where
my
brother
dan
repeated
grimes
abruptly
i
i
do
know
mum

mag
husky
and
dull

readily
for

her
trouble

merely
a
genteel
name
for

there
not
for
a
long
while
where
then
that
what
i

mum
not
at
all
grimes
tightened
her
lips
and
glared
plainly
she
believed
none
of
these
denials

she
snapped
an
keepin
out
the
way
just
now
is
that
it
this
was
what
no
torture
would
have
made
mag
acknowledge
but
with
all
her
vehemence
of
denial
her
discomposure

plain
to
see

she
declared
pleadingly
reely

nodded
and
grinned
at
upper
vacancy
as
one
might
at
a
descending
angel
grimes
meanwhile
close
at
his
elbow
preparing
to
get
away
as
soon
as
he
was
clear
past
her
for
blind
george
keenness
of
hearing
was
well
known
and
she
had
no
mind
he
should
guess
her
identity
good
afternoon
mum
the
blind
man
repeated
havin
tea
he
advanced
another
step
and
extended
his
stick
what
he
added
suddenly
turning
what
table
gone
what
this
doin
a
guy
clearin
out
no
george
mag
answered
i
only
moved
the
table
over
to
the
wall
it
is
come
an
feel
it
she
made
a
quick
gesture
over
his
shoulder
and
grimes
hurried
out
on
but
at
the
first
movement
blind
george
turned
sharply
there
she
goes
he
said
making
for
the
door
she
do
like
me
timid
little
darlin
hullo
my
dear
he
roared
down
the
stairs
hullo
you
never
give
me
a
kiss
i
know
you
wo
you
say
he
waited
a
moment
listening
intently
but
grimes
scuttled
into
the
passage
below
without
a
word
and
instantly
blind
george
supplemented
his
endearments
with
a
burst
of
foul
abuse
and
listened
again
this
expedient
succeeded
no
better
than
the
first
and
grimes
was
gone
without
a
sound
that
might
betray
her
identity
blind
george
shut
the
door
who
was
that
he
asked
oh
nobody
mag
answered
with
an
assumption
of
indifference
a
woman
i
know
name
o
jane
what
want
ah
now

come
to
it
blind
george
put
his
fiddle
and
bow
on
the
table
and
groped
for
a
chair

he
went
on

george
nobody
can
hear
what
is
it
why
said
the
blind
man
catching
her
tight
by
the
arm
and
leaning
forward
to
whisper
it
dan
that
what
it
is
it
dan
she
was
conscious
of
a
catching
of
the
breath
and
a
thump
of
the
heart
and
blind
george
knew
it
too
for
he
felt
it
through
the
arm
it
dan
he
repeated
so
now
you
know
if
it
what
you
like
listened
to
go
on
she
said
ah
well
fust
thing
all
bein
snug
five

he
slid
his
right
hand
down
to
her
wrist
and
with
his
left
pressed
the
money
into
hers
all
right
do
be
frightened
of
it

wo

but
i
got
a
few
bob
by
me
an
if
a
pal
ai
to
who
is
eh
who

he
grinned
under
the
white
eye
so
ghastly
a
counterfeit
of
friendly
that
the
woman
shrank
and
pulled
at
the
wrist
he
held
lord
love
ye
he
went
on
holding
tight
to
the
wrist
i
ai
the
bloke
to
round
on
a
pal
as
is
under
a
cloud
see

truth

that
the
truth
he
tugged
at
her
wrist
to
extort
an
answer
and
the
woman
face
was
drawn
with
fear
but
she
made
a
shift
to
say
with
elaborate
carelessness
reward
what
reward
george
i
dunno
nothin
about
it
he
growled
pushing
the
wrist
back
but
gripping
it
still
that
ai
not
to
a
pal
it
ai
not
to
a
faithful
pal

the
room
was
grown
darker
and
though
the
table
was
moved
the
shadow
on
the
floor
took
its
old
place
and
took
its
old
shape
and
grew
but
it
was
no
more
abhorrent
than
the
shadowy
face
with
its
sightless
white
eye
close
before
hers
and
the
hand
that
held
her
wrist
and
by
it
seemed
to
feel
the
pulse
of
her
very
mind

struggled
to
her
feet
let
go

wrist

said

blind
george
clumped
down
the
black
stair
and
so
reached
the
street
of
blue
gate
at
the
door
he
paused
listening
till
he
was
satisfied
of
musky
mag
movements
above
then
he
walked
a
few
yards
along
the
dark
street
and
stopped
from
a
black
archway
across
the
street
a
man
came
skulking
out
and
over
the
roadway
to
blind
george
side
it
was
viney
well
he
asked
eagerly
what
your
luck
blind
george
swore
vehemently
but
quietly
precious
little
he
answered

tip
the
whistle
viney
crept
growling
back
to
his
arch
and
blind
george
went
and
listened
at
mag
front
door
for
a
few
moments
more
then
he
turned
into
the
one
next
it
and
there
waited
invisible
listening
still
five
minutes
went
and
did
not
do
it
and
ten
minutes
went
and
five
times
ten
blue
gate
lay
darkling
in
evening
and
foul
shadows
moved
about
it
from
one
den
and
another
came
a
drawl
and
a
yaup
of
drunken
singing
a
fog
from
the
river
dulled
the
lights
at
the
highway
end
and
slowly
crept
up
the
narrow
way
it
was
near
an
hour
since
viney
and
blind
george
had
parted
when
there
grew
visible
coming
through
the
mist
from
the
highway
the
uncertain
figure
of
a
stranger
drifting
dubiously
from
door
to
door
staring
in
at
one
after
another
and
wandering
out
toward
the
gutter
to
peer
ahead
in
the
gloom
blind
george
could
hear
as
well
as
another
could
see
that
here
was
a
stranger
in
doubt
seeking
somebody
or
some
house
soon
the
man
elderly
a
trifle
bent
and
all
dusty
with
lime
came
in
turn
to
the
door
where
he
stood
and
at
once
blind
george
stepped
full
against
him
with
an
exclamation
and
many
excuses

fiddler

i
was
doin
the
friendly
that
all
bein
a
old
pal
but
i
off
all
right
i
off
so
long
he
hugged
his
fiddle
once
more
and
clumped
down
into
the
street
he
tapped
with
his
stick
till
he
struck
the
curb
and
then
crossed
the
muddy
roadway
while
viney
emerged
again
from
the
dark
arch
to
meet
him
all
right
said
blind
george
whispering
huskily
it
business
now
i
think
business
you
come
on
now
you
to
foller
if
they
come
out
together
if
they
do
well
you
must
look
arter
the
one
as
does
chapter
xviii
on
the
cop
when
the
limy
man
left
blue
gate
he
went
first
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
there
to
make
to
captain
kemp
some
small
report
on
the
wharf
by
the
lea
this
did
not
keep
him
long
and
soon
he
was
on
his
journey
home
to
the
wharf
itself
by
way
of
the
crooked
lanes
and
the
commercial
road
he
had
left
blue
gate
an
hour
and
more
when
musky
mag
emerged
from
her
black
stairway
peering
fearfully
about
the
street
ere
she
ventured
her
foot
over
the
step
so
she
stood
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
as
one
chancing
a
great
risk
stepped
boldly
on
the
pavement
and
turning
her
back
to
the
highway
walked
toward
back
lane
this
was
the
nearer
end
of
blue
gate
and
the
corner
turned
she
stopped
short
and
peeped
back
satisfied
that
she
had
no
follower
she
crossed
back
lane
and
taking
every
corner
as
she
came
to
it
with
a
like
precaution
threaded
the
maze
of
small
streets
that
lay
in
the
angle
between
the
great
rope
walk
and
commercial
road
this
wide
road
she
crossed
and
then
entered
the
dark
streets
beyond
in
rear
of
the
george
tavern
and
so
keeping
to
obscure
parallel
ways
sometimes
emerging
into
the
glare
of
the
main
road
more
commonly
slinking
in
its
darker
purlieus
but
never
out
of
touch
with
it
she
travelled
east
following
in
the
main
the
later
course
of
the
limy
man
who
had
left
blue
gate
by
its
opposite
end
the
fog
that
had
dulled
the
lights
in
ratcliff
highway
met
her
again
near
limehouse
basin
but
ere
she
reached
the
church
she
was
clear
of
it
once
more
beyond
the
shops
grew
few
and
the
lights
fewer
for
a
little
while
decent
houses
lined
the
way
the
houses
of
those
last
merchants
who
had
no
shame
to
live
near
the
docks
and
the
works
that
brought
their
money
at
last
amid
a
cluster
of
taverns
and
shops
that
were
all
for
the
sea
and
them
that
lived
on
it
the
east
india
dock
gates
stood
dim
and
tall
flanked
by
vast
raking
walls
so
that
one
might
suppose
a
chinese
city
to
seethe
within
and
away
to
the
left
the
dark
road
that
the
wall
overshadowed
was
lined
on
the
other
side
by
hedge
and
ditch
with
meadows
and
fields
beyond
that
were
now
no
more
than
a
vast
murky
gulf
so
that
no
stranger
peering
over
the
hedge
could
have
guessed
aright
if
he
looked
on
land
or
on
water
or
on
mere
black
vacancy
here
the
woman
made
a
last
twist
turning
down
a
side
street
and
coming
to
a
moment
stand
in
an
archway
this
done
she
passed
through
the
arch
into
a
path
before
a
row
of
cottages
and
so
gained
the
marshy
field
behind
the
accident
hospital
the
beginning
of
the
waste
called
the
cop
here
the
great
blackness
was
before
her
and
about
her
and
she
stumbled
and
laboured
on
the
invisible
ground
groping
for
pits
and
ditches
and
standing
breathless
again
and
again
to
listen
the
way
was
so
hard
as
to
seem
longer
than
it
was
and
in
the
darkness
she
must
needs
surmount
obstacles
that
in
daylight
she
would
have
turned
often
a
ditch
barred
her
way
and
when
after
long
search
a
means
of
crossing
was
found
it
was
commonly
a
plank
to
be
traversed
on
hands
and
knees
there
were
stagnant
pools
too
into
which
she
walked
more
than
once
and
twice
she
suffered
a
greater
shock
of
terror
first
at
a
scurry
of
rats
and
later
at
quick
footsteps
following
in
the
sodden
turf
the
footsteps
after
all
of
nothing
more
terrible
than
a
horse
of
inquiring
disposition
out
at
grass
so
she
went
for
what
seemed
miles
though
there
was
little
more
than
half
a
mile
in
a
line
from
where
she
had
left
the
lights
to
where
at
last
she
came
upon
a
rough
road
seamed
with
deep
ruts
and
made
visible
by
many
whitish
blotches
where
lime
had
fallen
and
had
there
been
ground
into
the
surface
to
the
left
this
road
stretched
away
toward
the
lights
of
bromley
and
bow
common
and
to
the
right
it
rose
by
an
easy
slope
over
the
river
wall
skirting
the
lea
and
there
ended
at
wharf
not
a
creature
was
on
the
road
and
no
sound
came
from
the
black
space
behind
her
with
a
breath
of
relief
she
set
foot
on
the
firmer
ground
and
hurried
up
the
slope
from
the
top
of
the
bank
she
could
see
wharf
just
below
with
two
dusty
lighters
moored
in
the
dull
river
and
beyond
the
river
the
measureless
dim
abbey
marsh
nearer
among
the
sheds
a
dog
barked
angrily
at
the
sound
of
strange
feet
a
bright
light
came
from
the
window
of
the
little
house
that
made
office
and
dwelling
for
the
and
something
less
of
the
same
light
from
the
open
door
for
there
the
limy
man
stood
waiting
leaning
on
the
and
smoking
his
pipe
he
grunted
a
greeting
as
mag
came
down
the
bank
bit
late
he
said
but
it
ai
easy
over
the
cop
for
a
stranger
where
the
woman
whispered
eagerly
where
is
he
the
limy
man
took
three
silent
pulls
at
his
pipe
then
he
took
it
from
his
mouth
with
some
deliberation
and
said

a
comprehensive
sweep

stem

the
sheds

one

grimes
the
wharfinger
resumed
his
pipe
and
mag
scuffled
off
to
where
the
light
from
the
window
fell
on
the
white
angle
of
a
small
wooden
shelter
the
place
was
dark
within
dusted
about
with
lime
and
its
door
stood
inward
she
stopped
and
peered
all
right
growled
dan
ogle
from
the

of
the
dark
ca

and
he
thrust
his
thin
face
and
big
shoulders
out
through
the
opening
o

the
woman
cried
putting
out
her
hands
as
though

on
the

it
was
at
a
bend
of
the
by
the

in
sight
of
kemp
wharf
that
dan
ogle
and
his
sister
met
at
last
dan
had
about
as
much
regard
for
her
as
she
had
for
him
and
the
total
made
something
a
long
way
short
of
affection
but
common
interests
brought
them
together
grimes
had
told
mag
that
she
knew
of
something
that
would
put
money
in
dan
pocket
and
as
money
was
just
what
dan
wanted
in
his
pocket
he
was
ready
to
hear
what
his
sister
had
to
tell
more
especially
as
it
seemed
plain
that
she
was
unaware
exactly
of
the
difficulty
that
had
sent
him
into
hiding
so
instructed
by
mag
she
came
to
the
cop
on
a
windy
morning
where
from
the
top
of
the
one
might
look
east
over
the
abbey
marsh
and
see
an
unresting
and
unceasing
press
of
grey
and
mottled
cloud
hurrying
up
from
the
flat
horizon
to
pass
overhead
and
vanish
in
the
smoke
of
london
to
the
west
grimes
avoided
the
wharf
for
she
saw
no
reason
why
her
her
late
employer
faithful
servant
should
witness
her
errand
she
climbed
the
at
a
place
where
it
neared
the
road
at
its
bromley
end
and
thence
she
walked
along
the
arrived
where
it
made
a
sharp
bend
she
descended
a
little
way
on
the
side
next
the
river
and
there
waited
dan
on
the
from
his
shed
spied
her
bonnet
from
afar
and
went
quietly
and
hastily
under
shelter
of
the
toward
where
she
stood
coming
below
her
on
the
he
climbed
the
bank
and

and

there
was
a
murder
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
a
week
ago
eh
dan
jaw
shut
with
a
snap
and
his
eye
was
full
of
sharp
inquiry
a
man
was
stabbed
against
the
door
an
the
one
as
did
it
got
away
over
the
river
one
o
the
two
dropped
a
leather
full
o
notes
an
the
kid

grandson
picked
it
up
in
the
rush
when
nobody

though
afterward
when

was
over
i
peeped
from
the
stairs
an
i
see
kemp
open
it
an
take
out
notes
bunches
of
dozens
ah

ye

staring
hard
at
his
sister
bunches
o
bank
notes
dozens
see
a
photo
too
likeness
of
a
woman
an
a
boy
it
was
there
grimes
stared
now
why

she
said
but
but
do
you
come
to
know
eh
dan
was
you
was
you
never
mind
whether
i
was
nor
where
i
was

o

a
face
like
that
ho
yes
you
a
beauty
dan
ogle
ai
ye
but
what
all
that
to
do
with
the
notes
grimes
face
was
blank
with
wonder
and
doubt
but
in
her
eyes
there
was
a
growing
and
hardening
suspicion
what
all
that
to
do
with
the
notes
it
all
to
do
with
o
that
i
let
another
chap
bring
a
watch
to
sell
o
takin
it
myself
an
come
back
with
a
fine
tale
about
nat
offerin
to
pay
for
them
notes
an
so
i
was
fool
enough
to
let
take
them
too
o
goin
myself
but
i
watched
though
watched
close
tried
to
make
a
bolt
an
an
so
nat
got
the
notes
after
all
it
seems
then
dan
said
grimes
retreating
a
step
dan
it
was
you
it
was
you
an
you
hiding
for
it
the
man
stood
awkward
and
sulky
like
a
loutish
schoolboy
detected
and
defiant
well
he
said
at
length
it
was
ai
got
no
proof
of
it
an
if
you
what
ye
come
for
eh
she
regarded
him
now
with
a
gaze
of
odd
curiosity
which
lasted
through
the
rest
of
their
talk
much
as
though
she
were
convinced
of
some
extraordinary
change
in
his
appearance
which
nevertheless
eluded
her
observation
i
told
you
what
i
come
for
she
answered
after
a
pause
about
gettin
them
notes
away
from
kemp
the
old
wretch
umph
old
wretch
wanted
to
keep
eh
well
the
game
grimes
in
no
way
abated
her
intent
gaze
but
she
came
a
little
closer
with
a
sidling
step
as
if
turning
her
back
to
a
possible
listener
there
was
two
inquests
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
she
said
two
on
the
same
day
there
was
kipps
as
lost
the
notes
when
kemp
got
an
there
was
marr
the
shipowner
an
it
was
as
lost
first
she
took
a
pace
back
as
she
said
this
looking
for
its
effect
but
dan
made
no
answer
albeit
his
frown
grew
deeper
and
his
eye
sharper
and
he
stood
alert
ready
to
treat
his
sister
as
friend
or
enemy
according
as
she
might
approve
herself
marr
lost
first
she
repeated
an
i
can
very
well
guess
how
though
when
i
came
here
i
did
know
you
was
in
it
how
did
i
know
thinks
you
that
marr
lost
first
i
got
eyes
an
i
got
ears
an
i
got
common
sense
an
i
see
the
photo
you
spoke
of
marr
an
mother
most
likely
anyhow
the
boy
was
marr
plain
whoever
the
woman
was
it
wanted
a
bit
o
thinkin
to
judge
what
them
notes
had
gone
through
but
i
did
dream
you
was
so
deep
in
it
lor
no
wonder
mag
was
frightened
when
i
see
still
dan
said
nothing
but
his
eyes
seemed
brighter
and
smaller
perhaps
dangerous
so
the
woman
proceeded
quickly
it
all
right
you
need
be
frightened
of
my
knowin
things
all
the
more
reason
for
your
the
notes
now
if
you
lost
before
but
it
halves
for
me
mind
ye
ai
it
halves
for
me
dan
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
growled
we
ai
got
yet
no
but
it
halves
when
we
do
get
or
else
i
wo
say
another
word
ai
it
halves
dan
ogle
could
afford
any
number
of
promises
if
they
would
win
him
information
all
right
he
said
halves
it
is
then
when
we
get
an
how
are
we
goin
to
do
it
grimes
sidled
closer
again
marr
the
shipowner
lost
first
she
said
an
he
was
pulled
out
o
the
river

an
murdered

at
the
back
o
the

the
wall

puzzled
and
suspicious
what

a
fool

a
man

secret
at

hole
in
the
wall
over

on
the

and
his

little
i

bigger
fool

nothing
but
a
gun
on
the
marsh
where
a
cockney
sportsman
was
out
after
anything
he
could
hit
but
dan
ogle
nerves
were
alert
and
throughout
the
conversation
he
had
not
relaxed
his
watch
toward
london
so
that
the
shot
behind
disturbed
him
enough
to
break
the
talk
we
been
here
long
enough
he
said

chapter
xx
stephen
tale
my
father
death
wrought
in
grandfather
nat
a
change
that
awed
me
he
looked
older
and
paler
even
smaller
he
talked
less
to
me
but
began
i
fancied
to
talk
to
himself
withal
his
manner
was
kinder
than
before
if
that
were
possible
though
it
was
with
a
sad
kindness
that
distressed
and
troubled
me
more
than
once
i
woke
at
night
with
on
my
face
and
found
him
gazing
down
at
me
with
a
grave
doubt
in
his
eyes
whereupon
he
would
say
nothing
but
pat
my
cheek
and
turn
away
early
one
evening
as
i
sat
in
the
and
my
grandfather
stood
moodily
at
the
door
between
that
and
the
bar
a
man
came
into
the
private
compartment
whom
i
had
seen
there
frequently
before
he
was
in
fact
the
man
who
had
brought
the
silver
spoons
on
the
morning
when
i
first
saw
ratcliff
highway
and
he
was
perhaps
the
most
regular
visitor
to
the
secluded
corner
of
the
bar
this
time
he
slipped
quietly
and
silently
in
at
the
door
and
remaining
just
within
it
out
of
sight
from
the
main
bar
beckoned
his
manner
suggesting
business
above
the
common
but
my
grandfather
only
frowned
grimly
and
stirred
not
as
much
as
a
finger
the
man
beckoned
again
impatiently
but
there
was
no
favour
in
grandfather
nat
eye
and
he
answered
with
a
growl
at
that
the
man
grew
more
vehement
patted
his
breast
pocket
jerked
his
thumb
and
made
dumb
words
with
a
great
play
of
mouth
you
get
out
said
grandfather
nat
a
shade
of
surprise
crossed
the
man
face
and
left
plain
alarm
behind
it
his
eyes
turned
quickly
toward
the
partition
which
hid
the
main
bar
from
him
and
he
backed
instantly
to
the
door
and
vanished
a
little
later
the
swing
doors
of
the
main
bar
were
agitated
and
an
eye
was
visible
between
them
peeping
they
parted
and
disclosed
the
face
of
that
same
stealthy
visitor
but
lately
sent
away
from
the
other
door
reassured
as
it
seemed
by
what
he
saw
of
the
company
present
he
came
boldly
in
and
called
for
a
drink
with
an
elaborate
air
of
unconcern
but
as
he
took
the
glass
from
the
potman
i
could
perceive
a
sidelong
glance
at
my
grandfather
and
presently
another
captain
nat
however
disregarded
him
wholly
while
the
pale
man
aware
of
he
knew
not
what
between
them
looked
alertly
from
one
to
the
other
ready
to
abandon
his
drink
or
to
remain
by
it
according
to
circumstances
the
man
of
the
silver
spoons
looked
indifferently
from
one
occupant
of
the
bar
to
the
next
as
he
took
his
cold
rum
there
was
the
pale
man
and
cripps
and
a
sailor
who
had
been
pretty
regular
in
the
bar
of
late
and
who
though
noisy
and
apt
to
break
into
disjointed
song
was
not
so
much
positively
drunk
as
never
wholly
sober
and
there
were
two
others
regular
frequenters
both
having
well
satisfied
himself
of
these
the
man
of
the
silver
spoons
finished
his
rum
and
walked
out
scarce
had
the
door
ceased
to
swing
behind
him
when
he
was
once
more
in
the
private
compartment
now
with
a
knowing
and
secure
smile
a
cough
and
a
nod
for
plainly
he
supposed
there
must
have
been
a
suspicious
customer
in
the
house
who
was
now
gone
grandfather
nat
let
fall
the
arm
that
rested
against
the
door
frame
out
you
go
he
roared
if
you
want
another
drink
the
other
bar
good
enough
for
you
if
you
do
i
do
want
you
here
so
out
you
go
the
man
was
dumbfounded
he
opened
his
mouth
as
though
to
say
something
but
closed
it
again
and
slunk
backward
out
you
go
shouted
the
unsober
sailor
in
the
large
bar
out
you
go
you
orders
see
lord
you
better
orders
when
it
kemp
ah
i
know
i
do
and
he
shook
his
head
stupidly
sententious
but
the
fellow
was
gone
for
good
and
the
pale
man
was
all
eyes
scratching
his
cheek
feebly
and
gazing
on
grandfather
nat
out
he
goes
the
noisy
sailor
went
on
that
orders
orders
or
mate
orders
all
one
like
father
like
son
ah
i
know
ah
piped
cripps
a
marvellous
fine
orficer
kemp
must
been
aboard
ship
i
sure
might
you
ever
ha
sailed
under
me
cried
the
sailor
with
a
dull
stare
me
under
well
no
not
under
but
orders
or
mate
orders
all
one
pursued
cripps
in
a
lower
voice
with
a
glance
over
the
bar
you
been
with
young
kemp
the
late
him
this
with
another
and
a
duller
stare
him
um
ah
well
never
mind
never
you
mind
see
you
mind
your
own
business
my
fine
feller
cripps
retired
within
himself
with
no
delay
and
fixed
an
abstracted
gaze
in
his
glass
i
think
he
was
having
a
disappointing
evening
people
were
disagreeable
and
nobody
had
stood
him
a
drink
more
captain
nat
had
been
quite
impracticable
of
late
and
for
days
all
approaches
to
the
subject
of
the
sign
or
the
board
to
paint
it
on
had
broken
down
hopelessly
at
the
start
as
to
the
man
just
sent
away
cripps
seemed
and
no
doubt
was
wholly
indifferent
captain
nat
was
merely
exercising
his
authority
in
his
own
bar
as
he
did
every
day
and
that
was
all
but
the
pale
man
was
clearly
uneasy
and
that
with
reason
for
as
afterwards
grew
plain
the
event
was
something
greater
than
it
seemed
indeed
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
end
of
the
indirect
traffic
in
watches
and
silver
spoons
from
that
moment
every
visitor
to
the
private
compartment
was
sent
away
with
the
same
peremptory
incivility
every
one
save
perhaps
some
rare
stranger
of
the
better
sort
who
came
for
nothing
but
a
drink
so
that
in
course
of
a
day
or
two
the
private
compartment
went
almost
out
of
use
and
the
pale
man
face
grew
paler
and
longer
as
the
hours
went
he
came
punctually
every
morning
as
usual
and
sat
his
time
out
with
the
stagnant
drink
before
him
till
he
received
my
grandfather
customary
order
to
drink
up
and
then
vanished
till
the
time
appointed
for
his
next
attendance
but
he
made
no
more
excursions
into
the
side
court
after
sellers
of
miscellaneous
valuables
from
what
i
know
of
my
grandfather
character
i
believe
that
the
pale
man
must
have
been
paid
regular
wages
for
grandfather
nat
was
not
a
man
to
cast
off
a
faithful
servant
though
plainly
the
man
feared
it
at
any
rate
there
he
remained
with
his
perpetual
drink
and
so
remained
until
many
things
came
to
an
end
together
there
was
a
certain
relief
and
i
think
an
odd
touch
of
triumph
in
grandfather
nat
face
and
manner
that
night
as
he
kissed
me
and
bade
me
as
for
myself
i
did
not
realise
the
change
but
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
my
grandfather
had
sent
away
his
customer
on
my
account
and
for
long
i
lay
awake
and
wondered
why
chapter
xxi
in
the
stephen
was
sound
asleep
and
the
hole
in
the
wall
had
closed
its
eyes
for
the
night
the
pale
man
had
shuffled
off
with
his
doubts
and
apprehensions
toward
the
highway
and
cripps
was
already
home
in
limehouse
only
the
sailor
was
within
hail
groping
toward
some
later
tavern
and
captain
nat
as
he
extinguished
the
lamps
in
the
bar
could
hear
his
song
in
the
distance
the
grub
was
bad
an
the
pay
was
low
leave
her
johnny
leave
her
so
hump
your
duds
an
ashore
you
go
for
it
time
for
us
to
leave
her
captain
nat
blew
out
the
last
light
in
the
bar
and
went
into
the
he
took
out
the
and
stood
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
lid
for
some
seconds
he
was
turning
at
last
to
extinguish
the
lamp
at
his
elbow
when
there
was
a
soft
step
without
and
a
cautious
tap
at
the
door
captain
nat
eyes
widened
and
the
went
back
under
the
shelf
the
tap
was
repeated
ere
the
old
man
could
reach
the
door
and
shoot
back
the
bolts
this
done
he
took
the
lamp
in
his
left
hand
and
opened
the
door
in
the
black
of
the
passage
a
man
stood
tall
and
rough
just
such
a
figure
captain
nat
had
seen
there
before
less
distinctly
and
in
a
briefer
glimpse
for
indeed
it
was
dan
ogle
well
said
captain
nat
good
evenin
dan
answered
with
an
uncouth
mixture
of
respect
and
familiarity
i
jist
want
five
minutes
with
you
o
you
do
do
you
replied
the
landlord
reaching
behind
himself
to
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
what
is
it
i
a
notion
i
seen
you
before
very
like
it
all
right
business
then
what
the
business
dan
ogle
glanced
to
left
and
right
in
the
gloom
of
the
alley
and
edged
a
step
nearer
best
spoke
of
indoors
he
said
hoarsely
best
for
you
an
me
too
nothin
to
be
afraid
of
business
afraid
of
phoo
come
in
then
dan
complied
with
an
awkward
assumption
of
jaunty
confidence
and
captain
nat
closed
the
door
behind
him
nobody
to
listen
i
suppose
asked
ogle
no
nobody
out
with
it
well
just
now
you
thought
you
seen
me
before

were
keen
and
hard

voice

confident

the
eye
was
shifty
now

a
chap
tried
to
do
me
an
i
put
his
light
out

went
for
me
an
chased
me
but
you
stuck
your
hooks
in
the
quids
right
enough
dan
ogle
tried
a
grin
and
a
wink
but
captain
nat
frown
never
changed
well

dan
went
on
after
a
pause
it
all
right
anyhow
i
outed
the
chap

so

captain
nat
with
a
foot
on
a
chair
and
a
hand
on
the
raised
knee
relaxed
not
a
shade
of
his
fierce
gaze
who

asked

while
the
other
arm
hung
straight
by
his
side
but
look
here
now
he
went
on
you
a
straight
man
an
you
round
on
a
chap
as
trusts
you
that
right
ai
it
well
truly
captain
nat
piercing
stare
his
unwavering
frown
were
disconcerting
dan
ogle
had
come
confidently
prepared
to
claim
a
share
of
the
plunder
just
as
he
would
have
done
from
any
rascal
in
blue
gate
but
in
presence
of
the
man
he
knew
for
his
master
he
had
had
to
begin
with
no
more
assurance
than
he
could
force
on
himself
and
now
though
he
had
met
not
a
word
of
refusal
he
was
reduced
to
pleading
but
he
saw
the
best
opening
as
by
a
flash
of
inspiration
and
beyond
that
he
had
another
resource
if
he
could
but
find
courage
to
use
it
well
said
captain
nat
you
the
sort
as
plays
the
square
game
with
a
man
as
trusts
you
very
well
trusted
you
i
come
an
put
myself
in
your
way
an
told
you
free
what
i
done
an
i
ask
as
man
to
man
for
my
fair
whack
o
the
stuff
bein
the
straight
man
you
are
you
do
the
fair
thing
captain
nat
brought
his
foot
down
from
the
chair
and
the
knee
from
under
his
hand
and
he
clenched
the
hand
on
the
table
but
neither
movement
disturbed
his
steady
gaze
so
he
stood
for
three
seconds
then
with
an
instant
dart
he
had
dan
ogle
by
the
hanging
arm
just
above
the
wrist
dan
sprang
and
struggled
but
his
wrist
might
have
been
chained
to
a
post
twice
he
made
offer
to
strike
at
captain
nat
face
with
the
free
hand
but
twice
the
blow
fainted
ere
it
had
well
begun
tall
and
powerful
as
he
was
he
knew
himself
no
match
for
the
old
skipper
pallid
and
staring
he
whispered
hoarsely
no
no
drop
it
do
put
me
away
do
crab
the
deal
d
y
captain
nat
grim
and
silent
slowly
drew
the
imprisoned
forward
and
plucked
a
bare
knife
from
within
the
sleeve
there
was
blood
on
it
for
his
grip
had
squeezed
arm
and
blade
together
umph
growled
captain
nat
i
saw
that
in
time
my
lad
and
he
stuck
the
knife
in
the
shelf
behind
him
me
i
was
meanin
anythink

i
was
the
ruffian
pleaded
cowering
but
vehement

his
neckerchief
to
his
cut
arm
that
where
i
carry
it
me
where
i
keep
it
ah
i
seen
it
done
before
but
it
an
awkward
place
if

squeeze
the
skipper
remarked
drily
now

to
me
you
say
you
come
an
put
yourself
in
my
power
an
trusted
me
so
you
have

sleeve
but

i
doubt
if

had
pluck
to
use

a
man
at
my
door
because
of
eight
hundred
pounds
you
got
between

but
to
get
that
money

i

captain
nat
turned
and
took
the
knife
from
the
shelf
now
see
he
went
on
you
done
justice
on
a
murderer
little
as
you
meant

but
do

police

to
fear
from
anybody
but
me
so
you
take
care
dan
ogle
come
enough
said
captain
nat
flung
wide
the
door
and
pitched
the
knife
into
the
outer
darkness
there
your
knife
go
after
it
chapter
xxii
on
the
cop
when
viney
followed
the
limy
man
from
musky
mag
door
he
kept
him
well
in
view
as
far
as
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
there
waited
but
when
grimes
emerged
and
viney
took
up
the
chase
he
had
scarce
made
of
the
way
through
the
crooked
lanes
toward
the
commercial
road
when
in
the
confusion
and
the
darkness
of
the
turnings
or
in
some
stray
rack
of
fog
the
man
of
lime
went
wholly
amissing
viney
hurried
forward
doubled
and
scoured
the
turnings
about
him
drawing
them
blank
he
hastened
for
the
main
road
and
there
consumed
well
nigh
an
hour
in
profitless
questing
to
and
fro
and
was
fain
at
last
to
seek
out
blind
george
and
confess
himself
beaten
but
blind
george
made
a
better
guess
after
viney
departure
in
the
wake
of
grimes
he
had
stood
patiently
on
guard
in
the
black
archway
and
had
got
his
reward
for
he
heard
musky
mag
feet
descend
her
stairs
noted
her
timid
pause
at
the
door
and
her
progress
to
the
street
corner
there
she
paused
again
as
he
judged
to
see
that
nobody
followed
and
then
hurried
out
of
earshot
he
was
no
such
fool
as
to
attempt
to
dog
a
woman
with
eyes
but
contented
himself
with
the
plain
inference
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
see
dan
ogle
and
that
the
man
whom
viney
was
following
had
brought
news
of
dan
whereabouts
and
with
that
he
turned
to
the
highway
and
his
fiddling
so
that
when
he
learned
that
the
limy
man
had
called
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
had
gone
out
of
viney
sight
on
his
way
east
blind
george
was
quick
to
think
of
kemp
wharf
and
to
resolve
that
his
next
walk
abroad
should
lead
him
to
the
lea
bank
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
after
some
trouble
dan
ogle
and
blind
george
met
on
the
cop
and
that
dan
consented
to
a
business
interview
with
viney
he
was
confident
enough
in
any
dealings
with
either
of
them
so
long
as
he
cockered
in
them
the
belief
that
he
still
had
the
notes
so
he
said
very
little
except
that
viney
might
come
and
make
any
proposal
he
pleased
hoping
for
some
expedient
whereby
he
might
screw
out
a
little
on
account
and
so
it
followed
that
on
the
morning
after
his
unsuccessful
negotiation
with
captain
nat
dan
ogle
found
himself
face
to
face
with
henry
viney
at
that
spot
on
the
where
he
had
talked
with
blind
george
dan
was
surly
first
because
it
was
policy
to
say
little
and
to
seem
intractable
and
again
because
after
the
night
adventure
it
came
natural
so
you
viney
are
you
he
said
well
i
ai
afraid
you
i
know
about
you
blind
george
told
me
game
who
said
anything
about
afraid
viney
protested
the
eternal
grin
twitching
nervously
in
his
yellow
cheeks
we
need
talk
about
being
afraid
it
seems
to
me
we
can
work
together
o
does
it
how
well
you
know
you
ca
change
what
o
damn
it
you
know
what
i
mean
the
money
the
notes
o
that
what
you
mean
is
it
well
i
ca
well
of
course
if
you
ca
eh
if
you
ca
they
might
be
so
much
rags
eh
they
might
i
ca
but
you
know
you
ca
retorted
the
other
with
a
spasm
of
apprehension
else
you
have
done
it
and
and
got
farther
off
well
i
might
but
that
ai
all
you
come
to
say
go
on
viney
thoughtfully
scratched
his
lank
cheek
peering
sharply
into
face
things
bein
what
they
are
he
said
reflectively
they
no
more
good
to
you
than
rags
not
so
much
all
right
they
ai
you
do
think
i
to
make
you
a
present
of
do
you
why
no
i
did
think
that
i
pay
reasonable
but
you
must
remember
that
they
no
good
to
you
at
all
not
worth
rag
price
so
whatever
you
got
be
clear
profit
then
how
much
clear
profit
will
you
give
me
viney
forefinger
paused
on
his
cheek
and
his
gaze
which
had
sunk
to
dan
ogle
waistcoat
shot
sharply
again
at
his
eyes
ten
pounds
said
viney
dan
chuckled
partly
at
the
absurdity
of
the
offer
partly
because
this
bargaining
for
the
unproducible
began
to
amuse
him
ten
pound
clear
profit
for
me
he
said
an
eight
hundred
pound
clear
profit
for
you
that
your
idea
of
a
fair
bit
o
trade
but
it
was
mine
first
and
and
it
no
good
to
you
you
say
so
yourself
no
nor
no
good
to
you
neither
why
you
ai
got
it
chuckle
became
a
grin
if
you
ha
said
a
hundred
now
what
why
then
i
ha
said
four
hundred
that
what
i
ha
said
four
hundred
why
you
mad
besides
i
have
got
it
i
got
nothing
till
i
can
change
the
notes
only
the
ten
dan
saw
the
chance
he
had
hoped
for
i
make
it
dirt
cheap
he
said
first
an
last
no
less
an
no
more
will
you
give
me
fifty
down
for
when
you
got
changed
yes
i
will
viney
voice
was
almost
too
eager
straight
no
tricks
eh
viney
was
indignant
at
the
suggestion
he
scorned
a
trick
no
hoppin
the
twig
with
the
whole
lot
an
leavin
me
in
the
cart
viney
was
deeply
hurt
he
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
very
well
i
trust
you
give
us
the
tenner
on
account
dan
ogle
stuck
out
his
hand
carelessly
but
it
remained
empty
i
said
i
give
fifty
when
they
changed
grinned
viney
knowingly
what
well
i
know
that
an
not
play
no
tricks
an
now
when
i
ask
you
to
pay
first
the
ten

got
you
do
want
to
do
it
that
look
like
a
chap
that
means
to
part
straight
and
square
does
it
viney
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
all
right
he
said
that
fair
enough
ten
now
an
forty
when
the
paper
changed
where
the
paper
o
i
ai
got
that
about
me
just
now
dan
replied
airily
be
here
same
time
but
you

give
me
the
ten
now
viney
teeth
showed
unamiably
through
his
grin
ah

said

here
with
that
same
time
what
it
was
dan
honour
that
smarted
now
what
wo
trust
me
with
ten
when
i
offer
free
an
open
to
trust
you
with
forty
o
it
off
then
i
done
it
enough
to
make
a
man
sick
and
he
turned
loftily
away
viney
grin
waxed
and
waned
and
he
followed
dan
with
his
eyes
thinking
hard
dan
stole
a
look
behind
and
stopped
look
here
viney
said
at
last
look
here

cut
it
short
we
ca
sharp
each
other
and
we
wasting
time
you
have
got
those
notes

and
answered
in
a
tone
between
question
and
retort
o

he
said
no

give
you
five
pounds

said
rather
feebly
no

you
cut
it
short
dan
looked
up
and
down
and
rubbed
his
cap
about
his
head
i
know

are
he
sulkily
concluded
you
know
where
they
are
but
you
ca

retorted
with
decision
can
i
get
dan
glanced
at
him
superciliously
you
he
answered
lord
no
can
we
get
together
dan
took
to
rubbing
his
cap
about
his
head
again
and
staring
very
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
then
he
came
a
step
nearer
and
looked
up
two
might
he
said
if
you
see
it
through
with
nerve
viney
took
him
by
the
upper
arm
and
drew
close
we
the
two
he
said
you
know
where
the
stuff
is
and
you
say
we
can
get

no

partners
and
we
divide

present

george

fish
for
himself
he
shoved
out
we
do
it
and
we
keep
what
we
get
now
where
are
the
notes
who
got
them
dan
ogle
stood
silent
a
moment
considering
he
looked
over
the
bank
toward
the
london
streets
down
on
the
grass
at
his
feet
and
then
up
at
an
adventurous
lark
that
sang
nearer
and
still
nearer
the
town
smoke
last
he
looked
at
viney
and
make
up
his
mind
who
got
he
repeated
nat
kemp
got
what
nat
kemp
got
viney
took
a
step
backward
turned
his
foot
on
the
slope
and
sat
back
on
the
bank
staring
at
dan
ogle
nat
kemp
he
said
nat
kemp
ay
nat
kemp

notes

the
leather

the
photo

the
whole
kit
marr
photo
ai
it
with
his
mother
yes
viney
answered
when
he
was
a
boy
he
was
a
particular
dutiful
son
but
he
always
carried
it
for
luck
or
something
but
kemp
where
did
get
them
dan
ogle
sat
on
the
bank
beside
viney
facing
the
river
and
there
told
him
the
tale
he
had
heard
from
grimes
also
he
told
him
with
many
suppressions
just
as
much
of
his
own
last
night
adventure
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
as
made
it
plain
that
captain
nat
meant
to
stick
to
what
he
had
got
viney
heard
it
all
in
silence
and
sat
for
a
while
with
his
head
between
his
hands
thinking
and
occasionally
swearing
at
last
he
looked
up
and
dropped
one
hand
to
his
knee
i
have
it
out
of
him
by
myself
he
said
if
it
was
that
i
want
to
lie
low
a
bit
dan
grunted
and
nodded
i
know
he
replied
the
i
know
about
that
viney
started
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
asked
pretty
well
all
you
could
tell
me

hear
things
though
i
am
lyin
up
but
i
heard
before
too
marr

like
a
viney

and
dropped
his
other
hand

so
blind
george
said
well

for
me
out
of
the
insurance
and
i
going
to
let
the
creditors
scramble
for
it
themselves
there

awkward
questions
for
me
with
the
books
in
the
receiver
hands
and
what
not
so
i
not
showing
for
a
bit
though
he
added
thoughtfully
i
do
know
that
i
might
try
it
even
now
dan
eyes
grew
sharp
we
doin
this
together
viney
he
said

nice
man

protested

ogle
was
sitting
with
his
chin
on
his
doubled

thoughtfully
at
the
muddy

he
replied
but
thorough
an
it
wipes
off

viney
looked
curiously
at
his
companion
well
he
said
an

more
in
it
than
eight
hundred
an
ten
a
lump
more
how
viney
eyes
widened
umph
dan
was

moment
then
he
turned
and

the
eyes

asked

said

intently
in
his
face
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
only

said

and
what

where
he

and

fixedly
at
his
confederate
face
and
then
then
what
then
i
come
on
he
do
know
i
there
behind
him
viney
mouth
opened
a
little
but
with
no
grin
and
for
a
minute
the
two
sat
each
looking
in
the
other
face
then
said
viney
with
a
certain
shrinking
no
no
not
that
it
hanging
you
know
hanging
for
both
dan
laughed
an
ugly
laugh
and
short
it
ai
hanging
for
he
said
it
hanging
for
gettin
caught
an
where
the
chance
o
that
we
take
our
own
time
and
the
best
place
you
ever
see
for
a
job
like
that
river
handy
at
the
end
an
all
an
everything
settled
beforehand
safe
a
job
as
ever
i
see
look
at
me
i
ai
hung
yet
am
i
but
took
my
chances
an
took
when
it
was
safe
like
as
this
is
viney
stared
at
vacancy
like
a
man
in
a
brown
study
and
his
dry
tongue
passed
slowly
along
his
drier
lips
as
for
bein
safe
dan
went
on
what
little
risk
there
is
is
for
you
all
right
we
do
know
each
other
not
likely
how
should
you
know
i
was
hidin
there
in
the
dark
when
you
went
to
speak
to
nat
kemp
come
to
that
it
might
ha
been
outed
instead
o
your
friend
what
you
was
talkin
so
sociable
with
an
there
more
there
than
what
in
the
remember
that
there
a
lump
more
than
that
viney
rubbed
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
how
do
you
know
he
asked
huskily
how
do
i
know
how
did
i
know
about
the
an
the
notes
i
ai
been
the
best
o
pals
with
my
sister
but
she
could
ha
been
there
all
this
time
without
my
hearing
a
thing
or
two
about
nat
to
say
nothing
of
what
everybody
knows
as
knows
anything
about
him
money
o
course
there
money
in
the
place
no
telling
how
much
watches
an
things
as
he
buys
twice
that
eight
hundred
more
viney
eyes
were
growing
sharper
growing
eager
it
sounds
all
right
he
remarked
a
little
less
huskily
especially
if
there
more
in
it
than
the
eight
hundred
but
but
are
you
you
know
sure
about
it
you
leave
that
to
me
i
see
after
my
department
an
yours
is
easy
enough
come
it
a
go
ai
it
but
perhaps
he
make
a
row
call
out
or
something
he
ai
the
sort
o
chap
to
squeal
an
if
he
was
he
would
not
the
way
i
goin
to
do
it
you
see
an
there
the
boy
what
about
him
o
the
kid
upstairs
he
no
account
after
we
outed
nat
no
a
tame
rabbit
an
we
have
all
night
to
turn
the
place
over
if
we
want
it
though
we
sha
we
be
split
out
before
the
potman
comes
fifty
mile
apart
with
full
pockets
an
nobody
a
the
wiser
viney
bit
at
his
fingers
and
his
eyes
lifted
and
sank
quick
and
keen
from
the
ground
to
ogle
face
and
back
again
but
it
was
enough
and
he
asked
for
no
more
persuasion
willing
murderers
both
they
set
to
planning
details
what
viney
should
say
if
it
were
necessary
to
carry
the
talk
with
captain
nat
beyond
the
first
sentence
or
so
where
they
must
meet
and
the
like
and
here
on
viney
motion
a
change
was
made
as
regarded
time
not
this
immediate
night
but
the
night
following
was
resolved
on
for
the
stroke
that
should
beggar
the
hole
in
the
wall
of
money
and
of
life
for
to
viney
it
seemed
desirable
first
to
get
his
belongings
away
from
his
present
lodgings
for
plain
reasons
so
as
to
throw
off
blind
george
and
so
as
to
avoid
flight
from
a
place
where
he
was
known
on
the
very
night
of
the
crime
this
it
were
well
to
do
at
once
yet
all
unprepared
as
he
was
he
could
not
guess
what
delays
might
intervene
and
so
for
all
reasons
captain
nat
and
the
child
were
reprieved
for
hours
thus
in
full
terms
the
treaty
was
made
dan
ogle
shrink
as
he
might
from
captain
nat
face
to
face
as
any
ruffian
in
blue
gate
would
was
as
ready
to
stab
him
in
the
back
for
vengeance
as
for
gain
for
he
was
conscious
that
never
in
all
his
years
of
bullying
and
scoundrelism
had
he
cut
quite
so
poor
a
figure
in
face
of
any
man
as
last
night
in
face
of
captain
nat
as
to
the
gain
it
promised
to
be
large
and
easy
in
the
getting
and
for
his
sister
now
that
she
could
help
no
more
she
could
as
readily
be
flung
out
of
the
business
as
blind
george
the
opportunity
was
undeniable
a
better
place
for
the
purpose
than
the
alley
leading
to
the
head
of
stairs
could
never
have
been
planned
once
the
house
was
shut
and
the
potman
gone
no
more
was
needed
than
to
see
the
next
police
patrol
go
by
and
the
thing
was
done
here
was
the
proper
accomplice
too
a
man
known
to
captain
nat
and
one
with
whom
he
would
readily
speak
and
in
ogle
eyes
the
business
was
no
more
than
a
common
stroke
of
his
trade
with
an
uncommon
prospect
of
profit
as
for
viney
money
was
what
he
wanted
and
here
it
could
be
made
as
it
seemed
with
no
great
risk
it
was
surer
far
than
going
direct
to
captain
nat
and
demanding
the
money
under
the
old
threat
that
was
a
little
outworn
and
indeed
was
not
so
substantial
a
bogey
as
it
might
seem
in
the
eyes
of
captain
nat
for
years
remorseful
and
now
apprehensive
for
his
grandchild
sake
for
the
matter
was
old
and
evidence
scarce
except
viney
own
which
it
would
worse
than
inconvenience
him
to
give
so
that
a
large
demand
might
break
down
while
here
as
he
was
persuaded
was
the
certainty
of
a
greater
gain
which
was
the
main
thing
and
if
any
shadow
of
scruple
against
direct
and
simple
murder
remained
it
vanished
in
the
reflection
that
not
he
but
ogle
would
be
the
perpetrator
as
well
as
the
contriver
for
himself
he
would
but
be
opening
an
innocent
conversation
with
kemp
so
viney
told
himself
and
so
desire
and
conscience
are
made
to
run
coupled
all
the
world
over
and
all
time
through
all
being
appointed
the
two
men
separated
they
stood
up
they
looked
about
them
over
the
lea
and
over
the
ragged
field
and
they
shook
hands
chapter
xxiii
on
the
cop
it
was
morning
still
as
viney
went
away
over
the
cop
and
when
he
had
vanished
beyond
the
distant
group
of
little
houses
dan
ogle
turned
and
crept
lazily
into
his
shelter
there
to
make
what
dinner
he
might
from
the
remnant
of
the
food
that
mag
had
brought
him
the
evening
before
and
to
doze
away
the
time
on
his
bed
of
dusty
sacks
till
she
should
bring
more
in
the
evening
to
come
he
would
have
given
much
for
a
drink
for
since
his
retreat
to
kemp
wharf
the
lime
had
penetrated
clothes
and
skin
and
had
invaded
his
very
vitals
more
particularly
it
had
invaded
his
throat
and
the
pint
or
so
of
beer
that
mag
brought
in
a
bottle
was
not
enough
to
do
more
than
aggravate
the
trouble
but
no
drink
was
there
and
no
money
to
buy
one
else
he
might
well
have
ventured
out
to
a
now
that
the
police
sought
him
no
more
as
for
grimes
of
the
wharf
who
had
been
growing
daily
more
impatient
of
dan
stay
he
offered
no
better
relief
than
a
surly
reference
to
the
pump
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
sit
and
swear
with
the
consolation
that
this
night
should
be
his
last
at
kemp
wharf
sunlight
came
with
the
afternoon
and
speckled
the
sluggish
lea
then
the
shadow
of
the
river
wall
fell
on
the
water
and
it
was
dull
again
and
the
sun
itself
grew
duller
and
lower
and
larger
in
the
haze
of
the
town
if
dan
ogle
had
climbed
the
bank
and
had
looked
across
the
cop
now
he
would
have
seen
blind
george
stick
in
hand
feeling
his
way
painfully
among
hummocks
and
ditches
in
the
distance
dan
however
was
expecting
nobody
and
he
no
longer
kept
watch
on
all
comers
so
that
blind
george
neared
unnoted
he
gained
the
road
at
last
and
walked
with
more
confidence
up
and
over
the
bank
and
down
on
the
side
next
the
river
he
went
so
boldly
that
one
at
a
distance
would
never
have
guessed
him
blind
for
on
any
plain
road
he
had
once
traversed
he
was
never
at
fault
and
he
turned
with
such
readiness
at
the
proper
spot
and
so
easily
picked
his
way
to
the
shed
that
dan
had
scarce
more
warning
than
could
bring
him
as
far
as
the
door
where
they
met
dan
the
blind
man
said
dan
old
pal
it
you
i
can
hear
i
bet
ai
it
where
are
ye
and
he
groped
for
a
friendly
grip
dan
ogle
was
taken
by
surprise
and
a
little
puzzled
still
he
could
do
no
harm
by
hearing
what
blind
george
had
to
say
so
he
answered
all
right
what
is
it
guided
by
the
sound
blind
george
straightway
seized
dan
arm
for
this
was
his
way
of
feeling
a
speaker
thoughts
while
he
heard
his
words
he
gone
he
said
gone
clean
do
you
know
where
dan
glared
into
the
sightless
eye
and
shook
his
captured
arm
roughly
who
he
asked
viney
did
you
let
him
have
the
stuff
what
stuff
when
what
stuff
that
a
rum
thing
to
ask
unless
o
george
dropped
his
voice
and
put
his
face
closer
anybody
to
hear
he
whispered
no
then
why
ask
what
stuff
you
did
let
him
have
it
this
morning
did
you
dunno
what
you
mean
never
seen
him
this
morning
blind
george
retracted
his
head
with
a
jerk
and
a
strange
look
grew
on
his
face
a
look
of
anger
and
suspicion
strange
because
the
great
colourless
eye
had
no
part
in
it
dan
he
said
slowly
them
the
words
of
a
pal
not
of
a
faithful
pal
they
ai
it
a
damn
lie
lie
yourself
retorted
dan
thrusting
him
away

fool
what

a
lie

he
was
standing
off
from

door

and
nervously
alert

growled
and
then
said

george
backed
involuntarily
but
his
blank
face
darkened
and
twisted
devilishly
and
he
gripped
his
stick
like
a
cudgel
ah
blind
ai
i
mighty
bold
with
a
blind
man
ai
ye
if

just
as
far
as

as
dan
advanced
the
stick
flourished
at
random
fell
on
his
wrist
with
a
crack
and
in
a
burst
of
rage
he
rushed
at
the
blind
man
and
smote
him
down
with
blow
on
blow
blind
george
beaten
to
a
heap
but
cowed
not
at
all
howled
like
a
wild
beast
and
struck
madly
with
his
stick
the
stick
reached
its
mark
more
than
once
and
goaded
ogle
to
a
greater
fury
he
punched
and
kicked
at
the
plunging
wretch
at
his
feet
who
desperate
and
unflinching
with
his
mouth
spluttering
blood
and
curses
never
ceased
to
strike
back
as
best
he
might
at
the
noise
grimes
came
hurrying
from
his
office
for
a
moment
he
stood
astonished
and
then
he
ran
and
caught
dan
by
the
arm
i
wo
have
it
he
cried
if
you
want
to
fight

go
somewhere
else

why

damme
the
man
blind
favoured
by
the
interruption
blind
george
crawled
a
little
off
smearing
his
hand
through
the
blood
on
his
face
breathless
and
battered
but
facing
his
enemy
still
with
unabashed
malevolence
for
a
moment
ogle
turned
angrily
on
grimes
but
checked
himself
and
let
fall
his
hands
blind
he
snarled
he
be
dead
too
if
he
do
keep
that
stick
to
hisself
that
what
he
be
the
blind
man
got
on
his
feet
and
backed
away
smearing
the
grisly
face
as
he
went
ah
hold
him
back
he
cried
with
a
double
mouthful
of

chapter
xxiv
on
the
cop
once
he
had
cut
clear
from
his
lodgings
without
delay
and
trouble
viney
fell
into
an
insupportable
nervous
impatience
which
grew
with
every
minute
his
reasons
for
the
day
postponement
now
seemed
wholly
insufficient
it
must
have
been
he
debated
with
himself
that
the
first
shock
of
the
suggestion
had
driven
him
to
the
nearest
excuse
to
put
the
job
off
as
it
were
a
dose
of
bitter
physic
but
now
that
the
thing
was
resolved
upon
and
nothing
remained
to
do
in
preparation
the
suspense
of
inactivity
became
intolerable
and
grew
to
torment
it
was
no
matter
of
scruple
or
compunction
of
that
he
never
dreamed
but
the
enterprise
was
dangerous
and
novel
and
as
the
vacant
hours
passed
he
imagined
new
perils
and
dreamed
a
dozen
hangings
till
at
last
as
night
came
on
he
began
to
fear
that
his
courage
could
not
hold
out
the
time
and
since
there
was
now
no
reason
for
delay
he
ended
with
a
resolve
to
get
the
thing
over
and
the
money
in
his
pockets
that
same
night
if
it
were
possible
and
with
that
view
he
set
out
for
the
cop
meantime
no
nervousness
troubled
his
confederate
for
him
it
was
but
a
good
stroke
of
trade
with
a
turn
of
revenge
in
it
and
the
penniless
interval
mattered
nothing
could
be
slept
off
in
fact
more
or
less
since
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
sun
sank
below
london
and
night
came
slow
and
black
over
the
marshes
and
the
cop
grimes
rising
from
the
doorstep
of
his
office
knocked
the
last
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
passed
indoors
dan
ogle
sitting
under
the
lee
of
his
shed
found
no
comfort
in
his
own
empty
pipe
and
no
tobacco
in
his
empty
pocket
he
rose
stretched
his
arms
and
looked
across
the
lea
and
the
cop
he
could
see
little
or
nothing
for
the
dark
was
closing
on
him
fast
blind
man
holiday
muttered
dan
ogle
and
he
turned
in
for
a
nap
on
his
bed
of
sacks
a
sulky
red
grew
up
into
the
darkening
western
sky
as
though
the
extinguished
sun
were
singeing
all
the
world
edge
so
one
saw
nimbus
from
this
point
every
night
and
saw
below
it
the
scattered
spangle
of
lights
that
were
the
suburban
sentries
of
the
myriads
beyond
the
cop
and
the
marshes
lay
and
nothing
but
the
faint
lap
of
water
hinted
that
a
river
divided
them
here
where
an
hour
habit
blotted
the
great
hum
of
london
from
the
consciousness
sounds
were
few
the
perseverance
of
the
lapping
water
forced
a
groan
now
and
again
from
the
moorings
of
an
invisible
barge
lying
by
the
wharf
and
as
often
a
ghostly
rustle
rose
on
the
wind
from
an
old
willow
on
the
farther
bank
and
presently
more
distinct
than
either
came
a
steady
snore
from
the
shed
where
dan
ogle
lay
a
rustle
that
was
not
of
any
tree
began
when
the
snore
was
at
its
steadiest
a
gentle
rustle
indeed
where
something
some
moving
shadow
in
the
black
about
it
crept
over
the
river
wall
clearer
against
a
faint
patch
which
had
been
white
with
lime
in
daylight
the
figure
grew
to
that
of
a
man
a
man
moving
in
that
murky
darkness
with
an
amazing
facility
address
and
quietness
down
toward
the
riverside
he
went
and
there
stooping
dipped
into
the
water
some
small
coarse
bag
of
cloth
that
hung
in
his
hand
then
he
rose
and
after
a
listening
pause
turned
toward
the
shed
whence
came
the
snore
with
three
steps
and
a
pause
and
three
steps
more
he
neared
the
door
the
stick
he
carried
silently
skimming
the
ground
before
him
his
face
turned
upward
his
single
eye
rolling
blankly
at
the
sky
that
was
the
same
for
him
at
night
or
noon
and
the
dripping
cloth
he
carried
diffused
a
pungent
smell
as
of
wetted
so
creeping
and
listening
he
reached
the
door
within
the
snore
was
regular
and
deep
nothing
held
the
door
but
a
latch
such
as
is
lifted
by
a
finger
thrust
through
a
hole
he
listened
for
a
moment
with
his
ear
at
this
hole
and
then
with
infinite
precaution
inserted
his
finger
and
lifted
the
latch
up
by
the
george
tavern
beyond
stepney
henry
viney
was
hastening
along
the
commercial
road
to
call
dan
ogle
to
immediate
business
ahead
of
him
by
a
good
distance
musky
mag
hurried
in
the
same
direction
bearing
food
in
a
saucer
and
handkerchief
and
beer
in
a
bottle
but
hurry
as
they
might
here
was
a
visitor
well
ahead
of
both
the
door
opened
with
something
of
a
jar
and
with
that
there
was
a
little
choke
in
the
snore
and
a
moment
silence
then
the
snore
began
again
deep
as
before
down
on
his
knees
went
dan
ogle
visitor
and
so
crawled
into
the
deep
of
the
shed
he
had
been
gone
no
more
than
a
few
seconds
when
the
snore
stopped
it
stopped
with
a
thump
and
a
gasp
and
a
sudden
buffeting
of
legs
and
arms
and
in
the
midst
arose
a
cry
a
cry
of
so
hideous
an
agony
that
grimes
the
snug
in
his
first
sleep
fifty
yards
away
sprang
erect
and
staring
in
bed
and
so
sat
motionless
for
half
a
minute
ere
he
remembered
his
legs
and
thrust
them
out
to
carry
him
to
the
window
and
the
dog
on
the
wharf
leapt
the
length
of
its
chain
answering
the
cry
with
a
torrent
of
wild
barks
floundering
and
tumbling
against
the
frail
boards
of
the
shed
the
two
men
came
out
at
the
door
in
a
struggling
knot
ogle
wrestling
and
striking
at
random
while
the
other
cunning
with
a
life
blindness
kept
his
own
head
safe
and
hung
as
a
dog
hangs
to
a
bull
his
hands
gripped
his
victim
by
ear
and
hair
while
the
thumbs
still
drove
at
the
eyes
the
mess
of
smoking
lime
that
clung
and
dripped
about
ogle
head
it
trickled
burning
through
his
hair
and
it
blistered
lips
and
tongue
as
he
yelled
and
yelled
again
in
the
extremity
of
his
anguish
over
they
rolled
before
the
doorway
and
ogle
snatching
now
at
last
instead
of
striking
tore
away
the
hands
from
his
face
fight
you
level
dan
ogle
fight
you
level
now
blind
george
gasped
between
quick
breaths
hit
me
now
you
blind
as
me
hit
me
knock
me
down
eh
quickly
he
climbed
to
his
feet
and
aimed
a
parting
blow
with
the
stick
that
hung
from
his
wrist
dead
he
whispered
hoarsely
not
afore
paid
you
no
he
might
have
stayed
to
strike
again
but
his
own
hands
were
blistered
in
the
struggle
and
he
hastened
off
toward
the
bank
there
to
wash
them
clear
of
the
slaking
lime
away
on
the
wharf
the
dog
was
yelping
and
choking
on
its
chain
like
a
mad
thing
screaming
still
with
a
growing
hoarseness
and
writhing
where
he
lay
the
blinded
wretch
scratched
helplessly
at
the
reeking
lime
that
scorched
his
skin
and
seared
his
eyes
almost
to
the
brain
grimes
came
running
in
shirt
and
trousers
and
as
soon
as
he
could
find
how
matters
stood
turned
and
ran
again
for
oil
good
god
he
said
lime
in
his
eyes
slaking
lime
why
why
it
must
be
the
blind
chap
it
must
fight
him
level
he
said
an
he
blinded
him
there
was
a
group
of
people
staring
at
the
patients
door
of
the
accident
hospital
when
viney
reached
the
spot
he
was
busy
enough
with
his
own
thoughts
but
he
stopped
and
stared
also
involuntarily
the
door
was
an
uninteresting
object
however
after
all
and
he
turned
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
one
he
well
remembered
it
was
the
limy
man
he
had
followed
from
blue
gate
to
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
then
lost
sight
of
grimes
recognised
viney
at
once
as
ogle
visitor
of
the
morning
that
a
pal
o
yourn
just
gone
in
there
he
said
viney
was
taken
aback
a
pal
he
asked
what
pal
ogle
dan
ogle
he
got
lime
in
his
eyes
an
blinded
lime
blinded
how
i
ai
goin
to
say
nothing
about
how
i
dunno
an
my
business
he
got
it
anyhow
there
a
woman
in
there
along
of
him
his
wife
i
or
something
you
can
talk
to
her
about
it
if
you
like
when
she
comes
out
i
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
grimes
had
all
the
reluctance
of
his
class
to
be
mixed
up
in
any
matter
likely
to
involve
trouble
at
a
and
what
was
more
he
saw
himself
possibly
compromised
in
the
matter
of
ogle
stay
at
the
wharf
but
viney
was
so
visibly
concerned
by
the
news
that
soon
the
relented
a
little
thinking
him
maybe
no
such
bad
fellow
after
all
since
he
was
so
anxious
about
his
friend
i
heard
said
he
added
presently
in
a
lower
tone
i
heard
said
it
was
a
blind
chap
done
it
out
o
spite
but
of
course
i
dunno
not
to
say
myself
what
i
heard
you
see
i
do
think
they
let
you
in
but
you
might
see
the
woman
they
wo
let
her
stop
long
takin
on
as
she
was
indeed
it
was
not
long
ere
musky
mag
emerged
reluctant
and
pallid
trembling
at
the
mouth
staring
but
seeing
nothing
grimes
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
aside
with
viney
here
a
friend
o
dan
grimes
said
not
unkindly
giving
the
woman
a
shake
of
the
arm
he
wants
to
know
how
he
gettin
on
what
she
asked
hoarsely
with
a
dull
look
in
face
what
i
heard
a
doctor
say
to
let
rest
an
in
the
mornin
what
some
sort
o
operation
grimes
hazarded
did
they
say
anything
else
blinded
the
woman
answered
weakly
blinded
but
the
pain
eased
with
the
oil
what
did
he
say
interposed
viney
fullest
of
his
own
concerns
did
he
say
someone
did
it
he
told
me
about
it
whispered
but
i
sha
say
nothing
nor
him
not
till
he
comes
out
i
say
he
must
get
talkin
about
it
viney
said
anxiously
it
it
upset
things
tell
him
when
you
see
him
here
listen
he
took
her
aside
out
of
grimes
hearing
it
would
do
he
said
it
would
do
to
have
anybody
charged
or
anything
just
now
we
got
something
big
to
pull
off
i
say
i
ought
to
see
him
you
know
ca
i
see
him
but
there
someone
might
know
me
no
but
you
must
tell
him
he
must
go
informing
or
anything
like
that
not
yet
tell
him
you
chargin
infornin
mag
answered
with
contempt
in
her
shaking
voice
would
go
informin
not
dan
dan
ai
that
sort
looks
arter
hisself
does
do
go
chargin
people
not
if
was
dyin
indeed
viney
did
not
sufficiently
understand
the
morals
of
blue
gate
where
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
common
enemy
the
police
was
a
foul
trick
to
which
none
would
stoop
in
blue
gate
a
man
inflicted
his
own
punishments
and
to
ask
aid
of
the
police
was
worse
than
mean
and
scandalous
it
was
weak
and
that
in
a
place
where
the
weak
did
not
last
as
the
phrase
went
it
was
the
one
restraint
the
sole
virtue
of
the
place
enduring
to
death
and
like
some
other
virtues
in
some
other
places
it
had
its
admixture
of
necessity
for
everybody
was
wanted
in
turn
and
to
call
for
the
help
of
a
policeman
who
might
as
likely
as
not
begin
by
seizing
oneself
by
the
collar
would
even
have
been
poor
policy
bad
equally
for
the
individual
and
for
the
community
so
that
to
resort
to
the
law
help
in
any
form
was
classed
with
narking
as
the
unpardonable
sin
you
sure
o
that
are
you
asked
viney
apprehensively
sure
i
sure
dunno
what
sort
o
chap
you
take
for

she
turned
away
with
a
sigh
that
was
near
a
sob
and
her
momentary
indignation
lapsed
once
more
into
anxious
grief
viney
went
off
with
his
head
confused
and
his
plans
in
the
ogle
scheme
was
gone
by
the
board
and
alone
he
could
scarce
trust
himself
in
any
enterprise
so
desperate
what
should
he
do
now
make
what
terms
he
might
with
captain
nat
need
was
pressing
but
he
must
think
chapter
xxv
stephen
tale
i
have
said
something
of
the
change
in
my
grandfather
habits
after
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
and
my
father
death
something
but
not
all
not
only
was
he
abstracted
in
manner
and
aged
in
look
but
he
grew
listless
in
matters
of
daily
life
and
even
doubtful
and
infirm
of
purpose
an
amazing
thing
in
him
whose
decision
of
character
had
made
his
a
corner
of
the
world
in
which
his
will
was
instant
law
and
with
it
and
through
it
all
i
could
feel
that
i
was
the
cause
it
ai
the
place
for
you
stevy
never
the
place
for
you
he
would
say
wistful
and
moody
wholly
disregarding
my
protests
which
i
doubt
he
even
heard
i
put
one
thing
right
he
said
once
thinking
aloud
as
i
sat
on
his
knee
but
it
ai
enough
it
ai
enough
and
i
was
sure
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
watches
and
spoons
as
to
that
matter
people
with
valuables
had
wholly
ceased
from
coming
to
the
private
compartment
but
the
pale
man
still
sat
in
his
corner
and
joe
the
potman
still
supplied
the
drink
he
neglected
his
uneasiness
grew
less
apparent
in
a
day
or
so
but
he
remained
puzzled
and
curious
though
no
doubt
well
enough
content
with
this
the
most
patent
example
of
grandfather
nat
irresolution
as
for
cripps
that
deliberate
artist
whole
practice
of
life
was
disorganised
by
captain
nat
indifference
and
he
was
driven
to
depend
for
the
barest
necessaries
on
the
casual
generosity
of
the
bar
in
particular
he
became
the
client
of
the
unsober
sailor
i
have
spoken
of
already
the
disciplinarian
who
had
roared
confirmation
of
my
grandfather
orders
when
the
man
of
the
silver
spoons
got
his
dismissal
this
sailor
was
old
in
the
ways
of
wapping
as
in
the
practice
of
soaking
it
would
seem
and
he
gave
himself
over
to
no
crimp
being
ashore
with
money
to
spend
he
preferred
to
come
alone
to
the
bar
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
spend
it
on
himself
getting
full
measure
for
every
penny
beyond
his
talent
of
ceaselessly
absorbing
liquor
without
becoming
wholly
drunk
and
a
shrewd
eye
for
his
correct
change
he
exhibited
the
single
personal
characteristic
of
a
very
demonstrative
respect
for
captain
nat
kemp
he
would
confirm
my
grandfather
slightest
order
with
shouts
and
threats
which
as
often
as
not
were
only
to
be
quelled
by
a
shout
or
a
threat
from
my
grandfather
himself
a
thing
of
instant
effect
however
ay
ay
sir
the
man
would
answer
and
humbly
return
to
his
pot
orders
he
would
sometimes
add
with
a
wink
and
a
hoarse
whisper
to
a
chance
neighbour
always
orders
knowed
both
father
son
so
that
cripps
ready
acquiescence
in
whatever
was
said
loudly
and
in
particular
his
own
habit
of
blandiloquence
led
to
a
sort
of
agreement
between
the
two
and
an
occasional
drink
at
the
expense
but
meantime
his
chief
patron
was
grown
so
abstracted
from
considerations
of
the
necessities
of
genius
so
impervious
to
hints
so
deaf
to
all
suggestion
of
that
cripps
was
driven
to
a
desperate
and
dramatic
stroke
one
morning
he
appeared
in
the
bar
carrying
the
board
for
the
sign
no
tale
of
a
board
no
description
or
account
of
a
board
no
estimate
or
admeasurement
of
a
board
but
the
actual
solid
material
board
itself
by
what
expedient
he
had
acquired
it
did
not
fully
appear
and
indeed
with
him
cash
and
credit
were
about
equally
scarce
but
upon
one
thing
he
most
vehemently
insisted
that
he
dared
not
return
home
without
the
money
to
pay
for
it
the
ravening
creditor
would
be
lying
in
wait
at
the
corner
of
his
street
cripps
device
for
breaking
through
captain
nat
abstraction
succeeded
beyond
all
calculation
for
my
grandfather
laid
hands
on
cripps
and
the
board
together
and
hauled
both
straightway
into
the
skippers
parlour
at
the
back
there
the
board
he
said
with
decision
an
there
you
the
paints
an
brushes
cripps
stock
of
paints
was
low
it
seemed
or
exhausted
his
brushes
were
at
home
and
his
creditor
was
at
the
corner
of
the
street
if
i
could
take
the
proceeds
cripps
began
but
grandfather
nat
interrupted
here
you
an
here
the
board
an
we
soon
get
the
tools
i
send
for
or
buy
new
here
joe
joe
get
you
say
what
you
want
an
he
fetch
here
you
are
an
here
you
stick
an
do
my
signboard
cripps
dared
not
struggle
for
his
liberty
and
indeed
a
promise
of
his
meals
at
the
proper
hours
reconciled
him
to
my
defiance
of
magna
charta
so
the
skipper
parlour
became
his
studio
and
there
he
was
left
in
company
with
his
materials
a
pot
of
beer
and
a
screw
of
tobacco
i
much
desired
to
see
the
painting
but
it
was
ruled
that
cripps
must
not
be
disturbed
i
think
i
must
have
restrained
my
curiosity
for
an
hour
at
least
ere
i
ventured
on
to
peep
through
a
little
window
used
for
the
passing
in
and
out
of
drinks
and
empty
glasses
here
my
view
was
somewhat
obstructed
by
cripps
pot
which
being
empty
he
had
placed
upside
down
in
the
opening
as
a
polite
intimation
to
whomsoever
it
might
concern
but
i
could
see
that
cripps
labours
having
proceeded
so
far
as
the
selection
of
a
convenient
chair
he
was
now
taking
relaxation
in
profound
slumber
so
i
went
away
and
said
nothing
when
at
last
he
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
his
dinner
cripps
regained
consciousness
with
a
sudden
bounce
that
almost
deposited
him
on
the
floor
conception
he
gasped
rubbing
his
eyes
conception
an
meditation
an
invention
is
what
you
want
in
a
job
like
this
ah
replied
my
grandfather
grimly
that
all
is
it
then
common
things
like
dinner
do
matter
perhaps
joe
better
take
it
away
but
it
seemed
that
cripps
wanted
his
dinner
too
he
had
it
but
grandfather
nat
made
it
clear
that
he
should
consider
meditation
wholly
inconsistent
with
tea
so
that
in
course
of
the
afternoon
cripps
was
fain
to
paint
the
board
white
and
so
earn
a
liberal
interval
of
rest
while
it
dried
and
at
night
he
went
away
home
without
the
price
of
the
board
but
instead
a
note
to
the
effect
that
the
amount
was
payable
on
application
to
captain
kemp
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
wapping
this
note
was
the
production
after
three
successive
failures
of
my
own
pen
and
to
me
a
matter
of
great
pride
and
delight
so
that
i
was
sadly
disappointed
to
observe
that
cripps
received
it
with
emotions
of
a
wholly
different
character
next
morning
cripps
returned
to
durance
with
another
pot
and
another
screw
of
tobacco
grandfather
nat
had
business
in
the
minories
in
the
matter
of
a
distiller
account
and
for
this
reason
divers
injunctions
stipulations
and
warnings
were
entered
into
and
laid
upon
cripps
before
his
departure
as
for
instance
it
was
agreed
that
cripps
should
remain
in
the
skipper
parlour
also
after
some
trouble
that
no
exception
should
be
made
to
the
foregoing
stipulation
even
in
the
event
of
cripps
feeling
it
necessary
to
go
out
somewhere
to
study
a
brick
wall
or
the
hole
in
it
from
nature
nor
even
if
he
felt
overcome
by
the
smell
of
paint
agreed
however
that
an
exception
be
granted
in
the
event
of
the
house
being
on
fire
further
this
with
more
trouble
that
one
pot
of
beer
before
dinner
is
enough
for
any
man
seriously
bent
on
the
pursuit
of
art
moreover
that
the
board
must
not
be
painted
white
again
lastly
that
the
period
of
invention
and
meditation
be
considered
at
an
end
and
that
sleep
on
cripps
part
be
regarded
as
an
acknowledgment
that
meals
are
over
for
the
day
these
articles
being
at
length
agreed
and
confirmed
and
cripps
having
been
duly
witnessed
to
make
certain
marks
with
charcoal
on
the
white
board
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
grandfather
nat
and
i
set
out
for
the
minories
his
moodiness
notwithstanding
it
was
part
of
his
new
habit
to
keep
me
near
him
as
much
as
possible
day
and
night
with
a
sort
of
wistful
jealousy
so
we
walked
hand
in
hand
over
the
swing
bridge
past
goose
into
the
highway
and
on
through
that
same
pageant
of
romance
and
squalor
the
tradesmen
at
their
doors
saluted
grandfather
nat
with
a
subdued
regard
as
i
had
observed
most
people
to
do
since
the
news
of
wreck
indeed
that
disaster
was
very
freely
spoken
of
all
along
the
waterside
as
a
deliberate
scuttling
and
it
was
felt
that
captain
nat
could
lay
his
bereavement
to
something
worse
than
the
fair
chance
of
the
seas
such
things
were
a
part
of
the
daily
talk
by
the
docks
and
here
all
the
familiar
features
were
present
while
it
was
especially
noted
that
nothing
had
been
seen
of
viney
since
the
news
came
he
meant
to
lie
safe
said
the
gossips
since
as
a
bankrupt
he
stood
to
gain
nothing
by
the
insurance
one
tradesman
alone
a
publican
just
beyond
blue
gate
greeted
my
grandfather
noisily
but
he
was
thoughtless
with
the
pride
of
commercial
achievement
for
he
was
enlarging
his
bar
a
large
one
already
by
the
demolition
of
the
adjoining
shop
and
he
was
anxious
to
exhibit
and
explain
his
designs
why
good
mornin
cried
the
publican
from
amid
scaffold
poles
and
you
a
stranger
lately
see
what
i
doin
here
come
in
here
an
look
how
this
eh
another
pair
o
doors
just
over
there
an
the
bar
brought
round
like
so
an
that
for
bottle
jug
and
throw
the
rest
into
public
bar
eh
the
party
wall
had
already
been
removed
and
the
structure
above
rested
on
baulks
and
beams
the
bar
was
screened
off
now
from
the
place
of
its
enlargement
by
nothing
but
canvas
and
tarpaulin
and
my
grandfather
and
his
acquaintance
stood
with
their
backs
to
this
to
survey
the
work
of
the
builders
waiting
by
my
grandfather
side
while
he
talked
i
was
soon
aware
that
business
was
brisk
in
the
bar
beyond
the
canvas
and
i
listened
idly
to
the
hum
of
custom
and
debate
suddenly
i
grew
aware
of
a
voice
i
knew
an
acrid
voice
just
within
the
canvas
then
if
you
useless
i
ai
said
the
voice
an
i
sha
let
it
drop
and
indeed
it
was
grimes
who
spoke
i
looked
up
quickly
at
grandfather
nat
but
he
was
interested
in
his
discussion
and
plainly
had
not
heard
grimes
declaration
drew
a
growling
answer
in
a
man
voice
wholly
indistinct
and
i
found
a
patch
in
the
canvas
with
a
loose
corner
which
afforded
a
grimes
was
nearest
with
her
back
to
the
canvas
so
that
her
skirts
threatened
to
close
my
view
opposite
her
were
two
persons
in
the
nearest
of
whom
i
was
surprised
to
recognise
the
woman
i
had
seen
twice
before
once
when
she
came
asking
confused
questions
to
grandfather
nat
about
the
man
who
sold
a
watch
and
once
when
she
fainted
at
the
inquest
and
grimes
was
too
respectable
to
stay
near
her
the
woman
looked
sorrowful
and
drawn
about
the
eyes
and
cheeks
and
she
held
to
the
arm
of
a
tall
man
his
face
was
seamed
with
ragged
and
blistered
skin
and
he
wore
a
shade
over
the
hollows
where
now
peeping
upward
i
could
see
no
eyes
but
shut
and
sunken
lids
so
that
at
first
it
was
hard
to
recognise
the
fellow
who
had
been
talking
to
this
same
woman
by
blue
gate
when
she
left
him
to
ask
those
questions
of
my
grandfather
and
indeed
i
should
never
have
remembered
him
but
that
the
woman
brought
him
to
my
mind
it
was
this
man
whose
growling
answer
i
had
heard
now
grimes
spoke
again
all
my
fault
from
the
beginning
she
said
o
yes
i
like
that
because
i
wanted
to
keep
myself
respectable
my
fault
or
not
i
wait
any
longer
for
you
if
i
ai
to
have
it
you
sha
an
if
i
ca
get
the
money
i
can
get
something
else
the
man
growled
again
and
swore
and
beat
his
stick
impotently
on
the
floor
you
a
fool
he
said
ca
you
wait
till
i
a
bit
straight
you
an
your
revenge
pah
when
there
money
to
be
had
not
much
to
be
had
your
way
it
seems
the
mess
you
made
of
it
precious
likely
to
do
any
better
now
ai
you
an
as
to
money
well
there
rewards
given
grandfather
nat
hand
fell
on
my
cap
and
startled
me
he
had
congratulated
his
friend
approved
his
plans
made
a
few
suggestions
and
now
was
ready
to
resume
the
walk
he
talked
still
as
he
took
my
hand
and
stood
thus
for
a
few
minutes
by
the
door
exchanging
views
with
the
publican
on
the
weather
the
last
ships
in
and
the
state
of
trade
i
heard
one
more
growl
louder
and
angrier
than
the
others
from
beyond
the
screen
and
a
sharper
answer
and
then
there
was
a
movement
and
the
slam
of
a
door
and
i
got
over
the
step
and
stretched
my
grandfather
arm
and
my
own
to
see
grimes
go
walking
up
the
street
when
we
were
free
of
the
publican
i
told
grandfather
nat
that
i
had
seen
grimes
in
the
bar
he
made
so
indifferent
a
reply
that
i
said
nothing
of
the
conversation
i
had
overheard
for
indeed
i
knew
nothing
of
its
significance
and
so
we
went
about
our
business
chapter
xxvi
stephen
tale
on
our
way
home
we
were
brought
to
a
stand
at
the
swing
bridge
which
lay
open
to
let
through
a
ship
we
were
too
late
for
the
perilous
lock
for
already
the
capstans
were
going
and
the
ship
fenders
were
squeaking
and
groaning
against
the
masonry
so
we
stood
and
waited
till
fore
main
and
mizzen
had
crawled
by
and
then
i
was
surprised
to
observe
foremost
and
most
impatient
among
the
passengers
on
the
opposite
side
cripps
the
winches
turned
and
the
bridge
swung
and
my
surprise
grew
when
i
perceived
that
cripps
made
no
effort
to
avoid
grandfather
nat
but
hurried
forward
to
meet
him
well
said
my
grandfather
gruffly
house
on
fire
no
sir
no
but
i
thought
sign
done
no
not
done
exactly
but
i
just
got
curious
noos
an
so
i
come
to
meet
you
what
the
news
not
exactly
as
you
might
say
noos
sir
but
information
information
that
been
transpired
to
me
this
mornin
more
or
less
unique
information
so
to
say
uncommon
unique
much
uniquer
than
usual
with
these
repetitions
cripps
looked
hard
in
my
grandfather
eyes
as
one
does
who
wishes
to
break
news
or
lead
up
to
a
painful
subject
what
it
all
about
asked
grandfather
nat
the
well
she
scuttled
wilful
kemp
scuttled
wilful
by
beecher
it
rumour
or
scandal
it
plain
evidence
my
grandfather
looked
fixedly
at
cripps
what
the
plain
evidence
he
asked
that
chap
that
been
so
much
in
the
bar
lately
cripps
answered
his
eyes
wide
with
the
importance
of
his
discovery
the
chap
that
soaks
so
heavy
an
shouts
at
any
one
you
order
out
he
was
aboard
the
on
the
voyage
out
an
he
deserted
at
monte
video
to
a
homeward
bound
ship
then
he
does
know
about
the
wreck
i
thought
my
grandfather
made
this
objection
almost
eagerly
no
but
he
deserted
he
said
he
preferred
bein
on
a
ship
as
was
meant
to
come
back
an
one
as
had
some
grub
aboard
him
others
beecher
tried
to
pile
up
time
an
again
an
says
the
chap
conolly
his
name
says
he
anything
as
went
wrong
aboard
the
was
beecher
doin
which
was
prophesied
in
the
a
score
o
times
she
got
to
monte
video
an
an
conolly
said
more
cripps
stole
another
sidelong
glance
at
grandfather
nat
confidential
to
me
this
mornin
conolly
said
more
what
he
said
it
was
the
first
officer
your
son
as
prevented
the
ship
bein
piled
up
on
the
voyage
out
an
all
but
knocked
beecher
down
once
an
he
said
they
was
near
fightin
half
the
time
he
was
with
an
he
said
surprisin
solemn
too
solemn
as
a
man
could
as
was
half
drunk
that
after
what
he
seen
an
heard
anything
as
happened
to
the
first
mate
was
no
accident
or
anything
like
it
that
what
he
said
confidential
to
me
this
mornin
we
were
walking
along
together
now
and
cripps
seemed
puzzled
that
his
information
produced
no
more
startling
effect
on
my
grandfather
the
old
man
face
was
pale
and
hard
but
there
was
no
sign
of
surprise
which
was
natural
seeing
that
this
was
no
news
as
cripps
supposed
but
merely
confirmation
he
said
there
was
never
any
skipper
so
about
the
boats
davits
bein
kep
in
order
as
beecher
was
that
trip
cripps
proceeded
an
he
kep
his
own
wonderful
handy
as
for
the
crew
they
kep
their
packed
all
the
time
they
could
see
enough
for
that
an
he
said
there
was
some
as
could
say
he
could
we
came
in
view
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
cripps
stopped
short
he
do
know
i
tellin
you
this
he
said
he
came
in
the
room
with
a
drink
an
got
talkin
confidential
he
very
close
about
it
you
know
what
sailors
are
grandfather
nat
frowned
and
nodded
indeed
nobody
knew
better
the
common
horror
of
complications
and
troubles
ashore
of
anything
that
might
lead
to
his
being
asked
for
responsible
evidence
even
for
his
own
protection
it
gave
impunity
to
of
the
iniquity
practised
on
the
high
seas
an
then
o
course
he
a
deserter
cripps
proceeded
so
i
think
you
better
say
i
told
you
not
to
him
you
can
give
information
or
i
can
an
then
they
make
him
talk
at
the
old
bailey
an
they
bring
others
grandfather
nat
winced
and
turned
away
then
he
stopped
again
and
said
angrily
damn
you
do
meddle
keep
your
mouth
shut
an
meddle
cripps
jaw
dropped
and
his
very
nose
paled
but
but
he
stammered
but
it
murder
murder
agin
beecher
an
viney
too
you
do
something
when
it
your
own
son
your
own
son
an
murder
my
grandfather
went
two
steps
on
his
way
with
a
stifled
groan
murder
he
muttered
murder
it
is
by
the
law
of
england
cripps
came
at
his
heels
very
blank
in
the
face
suddenly
my
grandfather
turned
on
him
again
pale
and
fierce
shut
your
mouth
d
hear
stow
your
slack
jaw
an
mind
your
own
business
or
i
grandfather
nat
lifted
his
hand
and
i
believe
nothing
but
a
paralysis
of
terror
kept
cripps
from
a
bolt
several
people
stopped
to
stare
and
the
old
man
saw
it
so
he
checked
his
wrath
and
walked
on
i
see
that
man
he
said
presently
flinging
the
words
at
cripps
over
his
shoulder
and
so
we
reached
the
hole
in
the
wall
cripps
sat
speechless
in
the
bar
and
trembled
while
grandfather
nat
remained
for
an
hour
in
the
skipper
parlour
with
conolly
the
what
they
said
one
to
another
i
never
learned
nor
even
if
my
grandfather
persuaded
the
man
to
tell
him
anything
though
there
can
be
no
doubt
he
did
for
myself
i
moved
uneasily
about
the
and
presently
i
slipped
out
into
the
alley
to
gaze
at
the
river
from
the
i
was
troubled
vaguely
as
a
child
often
is
who
strives
to
analyse
the
behaviour
of
his
elders
i
stared
some
while
at
the
barges
and
the
tugs
and
at
bill
stagg
boat
with
its
cage
of
fire
as
it
went
in
and
about
among
the
shipping
i
looked
at
the
bills
on
the
wall
where
new
tales
of
men
and
women
found
drowned
displaced
those
of
a
week
ago
and
i
fell
again
into
the
wonderment
and
conjecture
they
always
prompted
and
last
i
turned
up
the
alley
though
whether
to
look
out
on
the
street
or
to
stop
at
the
door
i
had
not
determined
as
i
went
i
grew
aware
of
a
tall
florid
man
with
thick
boots
and
very
large
whiskers
who
stood
at
the
entry
and
regarded
me
with
a
wide
and
ingratiating
smile
i
had
some
cloudy
remembrance
of
having
seen
him
before
walking
in
the
street
of
wapping
wall
and
as
he
seemed
to
be
coming
to
meet
me
i
went
on
past
the
door
to
meet
him
ah
he
said
with
a
slight
glance
toward
the
door
you
a
smart
fellow
i
can
see
and
he
patted
my
head
and
stooped
now
i
got
something
to
show
you
see
there
he
pulled
a
watch
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
i
was
much
interested
to
see
that
the
inward
part
swung
clear
out
from
the
case
on
a
hinge
exactly
as
i
had
seen
happen
with
another
watch
on
my
first
evening
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
that
a
rum
trick
ai
it
observed
the
stranger
smiling
wider
than
ever
i
assented
and
thanked
him
for
the
demonstration
ah
he
replied
you
as
clever
a
lad
as
ever
i
see
but
i
lay
you
never
see
a
watch
like
that
before
yes
i
did
i
answered
heartily
i
saw
one
once
no
no
said
the
florid
man
still
toying
with
the
watch
i
believe
that
it
your
gammon
why
where
did
you
see
one
he
shot
another
stealthy
glance
toward
the
door
as
he
said
it
and
the
glance
was
so
unlike
the
smile
that
my
sleeping
caution
was
alarmed
i
remembered
how
my
grandfather
had
come
by
the
watch
with
the
m
on
the
back
and
i
remember
his
repeated
warnings
that
i
must
not
why
where
did
you
see
one
asked
the
stranger
in
a
man
hand
i
said
with
stolid
truth
he
looked
at
me
so
sharply
through
his
grin
that
i
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
i
had
somehow
let
out
the
secret
after
all
but
i
resolved
to
hold
on
tight
ha
ha
he
laughed
in
a
man
hand
of
course
i
knew
you
was
a
smart
one
mine
has
got
any
letter
on
the
back
you
see
no
i
answered
with
elaborate
indifference
no
letter
and
as
i
spoke
i
found
more
matter
of
surprise
for
if
i
had
eyes
in
my
head
and
indeed
i
had
sharp
ones
there
was
grimes
in
a
dark
entry
across
the
street
watching
this
grinning
questioner
and
me
some
have
letters
on
the
back
said
the
questioner
mine
ai
that
sort
what
sort
here
joe
the
potman
dropped
or
knocked
over
something
in
the
and
the
stranger
started
i
think
i
wanted
indoors
i
said
moving
off
glad
of
the
interruption
the
florid
stranger
rose
and
walked
off
at
once
with
a
parting
smile
he
turned
at
the
corner
and
went
straight
away
without
so
much
as
a
look
toward
the
entry
where
grimes
was
i
fancied
he
walked
rather
like
a
policeman
chapter
xxvii

the

and

henry
viney
desperate
but
fearful
and
urgently
needy
these
three
skulked
at
bay
in
dark
holes
by
blue
gate
sullen
and
silent
to
doggedness
ogle
would
give
no
word
to
the
hospital
doctors
of
how
his
injury
had
befallen
and
in
three
days
he
would
brook
confinement
no
longer
but
rose
and
broke
away
defiant
of
persuasion
to
grope
into
the
outer
world
by
aid
of

blind
george
was
about
still
but
had
scarcely
been
near
the
highway
except
at
night
when
as
he
had
been
wont
to
boast
he
was
as
good
as
most
men
with
sound
eyes
it
was
thought
that
he
spent
his
days
over
the
water
as
would
be
the
way
of
one
feeling
the
need
of
temporary
caution
it
did
not
matter
that
could
rest
a
bit
blind
george
should
be
paid
and
paid
bitter
measure
but
first
the
job
in
hand
first
the
scheme
he
had
interrupted
first
the
money
here
were
doubt
and
difficulty
dan
ogle
plan
of
murder
and
comprehensive
pillage
was
gone
by
the
board
he
was
next
to
helpless
it
was
plain
that
whatever
plan
was
followed
viney
must
bear
the
active
part
dan
ogle
raved
and
cursed
to
find
his
partner
so
unpractised
a
ruffian
so
cautious
and
doubtful
a
confederate
grimes
made
the
matter
harder
and
it
was
plain
that
the
thing
must
be
either
brought
to
a
head
or
wholly
abandoned
if
only
on
her
account
for
she
had
her
own
idea
with
her
certain
revenge
on
captain
nat
and
a
contingent
reward
furthermore
she
saw
her
brother
useless
and
things
were
brought
to
a
head
when
she
would
wait
no
more
but
carried
her
intrigue
to
the
police
nothing
but
a
sudden
move
would
do
now
desperate
as
it
might
be
and
the
fact
screwed
viney
to
the
and
gave
new
vigour
to
ogle
shaken
frame
after
all
the
delay
had
not
been
great
no
more
than
a
few
days
captain
nat
suspected
nothing
and
the
chances
lay
that
the
notes
were
still
in
hand
as
they
had
been
when
ogle
sister
last
saw
them
for
he
could
afford
to
hold
them
and
dispose
of
them
at
a
later
and
safer
time
the
one
danger
was
from
this
manoeuvre
of
grimes
if
the
police
thought
well
enough
of
her
tale
to
act
without
preliminary
inquiry
they
might
be
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
with
a
at
any
moment
the
thing
must
be
done
at
once
that
very
night
musky
mag
had
never
left
dan
side
a
moment
since
she
had
brought
him
from
the
hospital
now
she
was
thrust
aside
and
bidden
to
keep
to
herself
viney
took
to
pen
ink
and
paper
and
the
two
men
waited
impatiently
for
midnight
it
was
then
that
viney
with
ogle
at
his
elbow
awaited
the
closing
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
hidden
in
the
dark
entry
whence
grimes
had
watched
the
policeman
fishing
for
information
a
few
hours
earlier
the
customers
grew
noisier
as
the
hour
neared
and
captain
nat
voice
was
heard
enjoining
order
once
or
twice
ere
at
last
it
was
raised
to
clear
the
bar
then
the
company
came
out
straggling
and
staggering
wrangling
and
singing
and
melted
away
into
the
dark
this
way
and
that
cripps
went
east
the
pale
pensioner
west
each
like
a
man
who
has
all
night
to
get
home
in
and
the
potman
having
fastened
the
shutters
took
his
coat
and
hat
and
went
his
way
also
there
was
but
one
other
tavern
in
sight
and
that
closed
at
the
same
time
as
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
since
none
nearer
than
paddy
goose
remained
open
till
one
wapping
wall
was
soon
dark
and
empty
there
were
holes
near
the
top
of
the
shutters
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
light
was
visible
through
these
a
sign
that
captain
nat
was
still
engaged
in
the
bar
presently
the
light
dulled
and
then
disappeared
he
had
extinguished
the
lamps
now
was
the
time
while
he
was
in
the
viney
came
out
from
the
entry
pulling
ogle
by
the
arm
and
crossed
the
street
he
brought
him
to
the
court
entrance
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
end
post
this
is
the
first
post
in
the
court
viney
whispered
wait
here
while
i
go
we
both
know
what
to
do
viney
to
the
door
and
tapped
there
was
a
heavy
footstep
within
and
the
door
was
flung
open
there
stood
captain
nat
with
the
in
his
hand
who
that
said
captain
nat
come
into
the
light
viney
took
a
deep
breath
me
he
answered
i
come
in
i
got
something
to
say
he
went
in
with
his
back
against
the
and
captain
nat
turned
slowly
each
man
watching
the
other
then
the
landlord
put
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
shut
the
door
well
he
said
i
hear
you
say
it
there
was
something
odd
about
captain
nat
eyes
something
new
and
something
that
viney
did
not
like
hard
and
quiet
not
anger
it
would
seem
but
indefinable
and
worse
viney
braced
himself
with
another
inspiration
of
breath
first
he
said
i
alone
here
but
i
left
word
there
a
friend
o
mine
not
far
off
waiting

waiting
where
he
can
hear
the

it
here

all
i
got
to
say
for
a
moment
captain
nat
impassibility
was
disturbed
and
he
looked
sharply
at
viney

he
said
what
this
partner
notes
what
i
said
it
plain
an
you

captain
nat
compressed
his
lips
and
folded
his
arms
there
was
a
woman

about
this
he
said
slowly
after
a
pause
a
woman
an
a
man
they
each
took
a
try
at
that
money
in
different
ways
they
must
be

got
a
boy
to
remember
think
o
the
boy
captain
nat
stood
for
a
little
silent
and
thoughtful
his
eyes
directed
absently
on
viney
as
though
he
saw
him
not
and
as
he
stood
so
the
darkness
cleared
from
his
face
not
that
moment
darkness
only
but
all
the
hardness
of
years
seemed
to
abate
in
the
old
skipper
features
so
that
presently
captain
nat
stood
transfigured
ay
he
said
at
last
the
boy
i
think
o
the
boy
god
bless
him
you
shall
have
your
money
viney
though
whether
it
ought
to
be
yours
i
do
know
viney
when
you
came
in
i
was
ready
to
break
you
in
pieces
with
my
bare
hands
which
i
could
do
easy
as
you
know
well
enough
he
stretched
forth
the
great
knotted
hands
and
viney
shrank
before
them
i
was
ready
to
kill
you
with
my
hands
an
would
ha
done
it
for
a
reason
i
tell
you
of

i
fetch

viney
a
little
nervously
as
the
old
man
turned
toward
the
staircase
door
tricks
came
the
answer
no
an
end
of
all
tricks
and
captain
nat
tramped
heavily
up
the
stair
chapter

stephen
tale
my
grandfather
was
uncommonly
silent
all
that
day
after
his
interview
with
conolly
he
bade
me
good
night
when
i
went
to
bed
and
kissed
me
but
he
said
no
more
though
he
sat
by
my
bed
till
i
fell
asleep
while
joe
attended
the
bar
i
had
a
way
now
and
again
of
waking
when
the
bar
was
closed
perhaps
because
of
the
noise
and
commonly
at
these
times
i
lay
awake
till
grandfather
nat
came
to
bed
to
bid
him
good
night
once
more
it
was
so
this
night
the
night
of
nights
i
woke
at
the
shouting
and
the
stumbling
into
the
street
and
lay
while
the
bar
was
cleared
and
the
doors
banged
and
fastened
my
grandfather
seemed
to
stay
uncommonly
long
and
presently
as
the
night
grew
stiller
i
was
aware
of
voices
joined
in
conversation
below
i
wondered
greatly
who
could
be
talking
with
grandfather
nat
at
this
hour
and
i
got
out
of
bed
to
listen
at
the
it
could
not
be
bill
stagg
for
the
voices
were
in
the
and
not
in
the
behind
and
it
was
not
joe
the
potman
for
i
had
heard
him
go
and
i
knew
his
step
well
i
wondered
if
grandfather
nat
would
mind
if
i
went
down
to
see
i
was
doubtful
and
i
temporised
i
began
to
put
on
some
clothes
listening
from
time
to
time
at
the
in
hope
that
i
might
recognise
the
other
voice
but
indeed
both
voices
were
indistinct
and
i
could
not
distinguish
one
from
the
other
and
then
of
a
sudden
the
stairfoot
door
opened
and
my
grandfather
came
upstairs
heavy
and
slow
i
doubted
what
he
might
say
when
he
saw
my
clothes
on
but
he
seemed
not
to
notice
it
he
brought
a
candle
in
from
the
landing
and
he
looked
strangely
grave
grave
with
a
curious
composure
he
went
to
the
little
at
his
and
took
out
the
which
had
not
been
downstairs
since
the
pale
man
had
ceased
work
stevy
my
boy
he
said
have
you
said
your
prayers
yes
grandfather
an
did
forget

piteous
now
in
my
grandfather
hard
grave
face
do

i
pleaded
with
my
arm
at
his
neck
do

nat
you

to
die
are
you
that
as
god
wills
my
boy
we
must
all
die
some
day
i
think
he
was
near
breaking
down
here
but
at
the
moment
a
voice
called
up
the
stairs
are
you
coming
said
the
voice
time
nearly
up
and
it
frightened
me
more
than
i
can
say
to
know
this
second
voice
at
last
for
viney
but
my
grandfather
was
firm
again
at
once
yes
he
cried
coming
no
more
to
do
stevy
snivelling
no
good
and
then
grandfather
nat
put
his
hands
clumsily
together
and
shut
his
eyes
like
a
little
child
god
bless
an
save
this
boy
whatever
happens
amen
said
grandfather
nat
then
he
rose
and
took
from
the
the
watch
that
the
man
had
sold
there
that
too
he
said
musingly
i
dunno
why
i
it
so
long
and
with
that
he
shut
the
and
strode
across
to
the
landing
he
looked
back
at
me
for
a
moment
but
said
nothing
and
then
descended
the
stairs
bewildered
and
miserably
frightened
i
followed
him
i
could
neither
reason
nor
cry
out
and
i
had
an
agonised
hope
that
i
was
not
really
awake
and
that
this
was
just
such
a
nightmare
as
had
afflicted
me
on
the
night
of
the
murder
at
our
door
i
crouched
on
the
lower
stairs
and
listened
yes
i
got
it
said
my
grandfather
answering
an
eager
question
there
it
is
look
at
that
count
the
notes
i
heard
a
hasty
scrabbling
of
paper
right
asked
my
grandfather
quite
right
viney
answered
and
there
was
exultation
in
his
voice
pack
up
put
safe
in
your
pocket
quite
safe
there
the
watch
too
i
paid
for
that
oh
the
watch
well
all
right
i
do
mind
having
that
too
since
you
pressing
you
might
ha
saved
a
deal
of
trouble
yours
mine
too
if
you
done
all
this
before
yes

but
i
clear
up
all
now

the
notes

you
all
safe
there
was
the
sound
of
a
slap
on
a
and
the
watch
ay
and
the
watch
good
i
heard
a
bounce
and
a
gasp
of
terror
and
then
my
grandfather
voice
again
come

be
quits
to
the
end

both
of
us

could
stay
no
longer
viney
was
struggling
desperately
reasoning
entreating
i
pushed
open
the
staircase
door
but
neither
seemed
to
note
me
my
grandfather
had
viney
by
arm
and
collar
and
was
shaking
him
face
downward
i
go

gasped
hoarsely

i
thought
of
the
boy
an
i
thought
of
his
father
god
mind
the
boy
you
made
an
orphan
come
my
grandfather
flung
wide
the
door
and
tumbled
viney
up
the
steps
into
the
court
the
little
table
with
the
lamp
on
it
rocked
from
a
kick
and
i
saved
it
by
sheer
instinct
for
i
was
sick
with
terror
i
followed
into
the
court
and
saw
my
grandfather
now
nearly
at
the
street
corner
hustling
and
dragging
his
prisoner
dan
dan
viney
was
crying
struggling
wildly
dan
i
got
it
draw
him
off
me
dan
go
for
the
kid
an
draw
him
off
go
for
the
kid
on
the
stairs
and
i
could
see
a
man
come
groping
between
the
wall
and
the
posts
a
hand
feeling
from
one
post
to
the
next
and
the
stick
in
the
other
hand
scraping
the
wall
i
ran
out
to
the
farther
side
of
the
alley
viney
shout
distracted
my
grandfather
attention
and
i
saw
him
looking
anxiously
back
with
that
viney
took
his
chance
and
flung
himself
desperately
round
the
end
post
his
collar
went
with
a
rip
and
he
ran
for
a
moment
my
grandfather
stood
irresolute
and
i
ran
toward
him
i
am
safe
here
i
cried
come
away
grandfather
but
when
he
saw
me
clear
of
the
groping
man
he
turned
and
dashed
after
viney
while
from
the
i
heard
a
curse
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass
i
vaguely
wondered
if
viney
confederate
were
smashing
windows
in
the
partition
and
then
i
ran
my
hardest
after
grandfather
nat
viney
had
made
up
the
street
toward
the
bridge
and
ratcliff
highway
and
captain
nat
pursued
with
shouts
of
stop
him
breathless
and
unsteady
i
made
slow
progress
with
my
smaller
legs
over
the
rough
which
twisted
my
feet
all
ways
as
i
ran
but
i
was
conscious
of
a
gathering
of
other
cries
ahead
and
i
struggled
on
with
throbbing
head
and
bursting
heart
plainly
there
were
more
shouts
as
i
neared
the
corner
and
a
running
of
more
men
than
two
and
when
the
corner
was
turned
and
the
bridge
and
the
lock
before
me
i
saw
that
the
chase
was
over
three
lanterns
were
flashing
to
and
fro
pointing
their
long
rays
down
on
the
black
and
the
policemen
who
directed
them
were
calling
to
dockmen
on
the
dark
quay
who
cried
back
and
ran
and
called
again
man
in
cried
one
and
another
hurrying
in
from
the
highway
fell
off
the
lock
no
he
cut
his
lucky
an
headered
in
he
did
i
tell
ye
yes
he
did
why
i
see
i
could
not
see
my
grandfather
and
for
a
moment
my
thumping
heart
stood
still
and
sick
with
the
fear
that
it
was
he
who
was
drowning
in
the
dock
then
a
policeman
swung
his
lantern
across
to
the
opposite
side
and
in
the
passing
flash
grandfather
nat
figure
stood
hard
and
clear
for
an
instant
and
no
more
he
was
standing
midway
on
the
lock
staring
and
panting
and
leaning
on
a
stanchion
with
a
dozen
risks
of
being
knocked
into
the
dock
by
excited
onlookers
i
scrambled
down
to
the
lock
and
seized
the
first
stanchion
it
creaked
and
tottered
in
my
hand
but
i
went
forward
gripping
at
the
swaying
chain
and
keeping
foothold
on
the
slippery
uneven
timbers
i
knew
not
how
sometimes
the
sagging
chain
would
give
till
i
felt
myself
pitching
headlong
only
to
be
saved
by
the
check
of
the
stanchion
against
the
side
of
the
socket
and
once
the
chain
hung
so
low
where
it
had
slipped
through
the
next
that
i
had
no
choice
but
to
let
go
and
plunged
in
the
dark
for
the
next
upright
it
might
have
been
to
plunge
into
space
grandfather
nat
grandfather
nat
i
reached
him
somehow
at
last
and
caught
tight
at
his
wrist
he
was
leaning
on
the
stanchion
still
and
staring
at
the
dark
water
here
i
am
grandfather
i
said
but
i
am
frightened
stay
with
me
please
for
a
little
while
he
still
peered
into
the
gloom
then
he
turned
and
said
quietly
i
lost
him
stevy
he
went
over
here
by
the
sweep
of
his
hand
i
saw
what
had
happened
though
i
could
scarce
realise
the
whole
matter
then
and
there
as
i
presently
learnt
however
viney
was
running
full
for
the
bridge
with
captain
nat
shouting
behind
him
when
he
saw
the
lanterns
of
the
three
policemen
barring
the
bridge
as
they
came
on
their
beat
from
the
highway
to
avoid
them
he
swung
aside
and
made
for
the
lock
with
his
pursuer
hard
at
his
heels
now
a
lock
of
that
sort
joins
in
an
angle
or
mitre
at
the
middle
where
the
two
sides
meet
like
a
valve
pointing
to
resist
the
tide
so
that
the
hazardous
path
along
the
top
turns
off
sharply
midway
flying
headlong
with
thought
of
nothing
but
the
avenger
behind
him
viney
overran
the
angle
meeting
the
low
chain
full
under
his
knees
and
so
was
gone
with
a
yell
and
a
splash
grandfather
nat
took
me
by
the
collar
and
turned
me
round
we
get
back
stevy
he
said
go
on
i
hold
you
tight
and
so
in
the
pitchy
dark
i
went
back
along
the
way
i
had
come
walking
before
my
grandfather
as
i
had
done
when
first
i
saw
that
lock
the
dockmen
had
flung
random
and
now
were
groping
with
drags
and
hooks
some
judged
that
the
man
must
have
gone
under
like
a
stone
others
thought
it
quite
likely
that
a
good
swimmer
might
have
got
away
quietly
and
everybody
wished
to
know
who
the
man
was
and
why
he
was
running
to
all
such
questions
my
grandfather
made
the
same
answer
it
was
a
man
i
wanted
wanted
bad
for
the
police
you
find
him
dead
or
alive
i
identify
him
an
say
the
rest
in
the
proper
place
that
all
only
once
he
amplified
this
answer
and
then
he
said
you
can
judge
he
was
as
much
afraid
o
the
police
as
he
was
o
me
or
more
look
where
he
went
when
he
saw
on
the
bridge
and
again
he
repeated
i
say
the
rest
when
he
found
not
before
an
nobody
can
make
me
he
was
calm
and
cool
enough
now
as
i
could
feel
as
well
as
hear
for
my
hand
was
buried
in
his
while
he
pushed
his
way
stolidly
through
the
little
crowd
as
for
myself
i
could
neither
think
nor
speak
nor
laugh
nor
cry
though
dizzily
conscious
of
an
impulse
to
do
all
four
at
once
i
had
grandfather
nat
again
and
now
he
would
not
go
away
that
i
could
realise
and
i
clung
with
all
my
might
to
as
much
of
his
hand
as
i
could
grip
chapter
xxix
stephen
tale
but
i
was
to
have
neither
time
to
gather
my
wits
nor
quiet
to
assort
my
emotions
for
the
full
issue
of
that
night
was
not
yet
even
as
we
were
pushing
through
the
little
crowd
and
even
as
my
grandfather
parried
question
with
answer
a
new
cry
rose
and
at
the
sound
the
crowd
began
to
melt
for
it
was
the
cry
of
fire
a
single
shout
at
first
and
then
another
and
then
a
clamour
of
three
together
and
a
beat
of
running
feet
men
about
us
started
off
and
as
we
rounded
the
corner
one
came
running
back
on
his
tracks
kemp
it
your
house
he
cried
your
house
kemp
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
hole
in
the
wall
then
was
dire
confusion
i
was
caught
in
a
whir
of
running
men
and
i
galloped
and
stumbled
along
as
i
might
dragging
dependent
from
my
grandfather
hand
somewhere
ahead
a
wavering
light
danced
before
my
eyes
and
there
was
a
sudden
outburst
of
loud
cracks
as
of
a
hundred
carters
whips
and
then
screams
screams
without
a
doubt
confusedly
my
mind
went
back
to
viney
confederate
groping
in
at
the
door
what
had
he
done
smashed
glass
glass
it
must
have
been
the
lamp
the
lamp
on
the
little
table
by
the
door
the
lamp
i
had
myself
saved
but
ten
minutes
earlier
now
we
were
opposite
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
loud
cracks
were
joined
with
a
roar
of
flame
out
it
came
gushing
at
the
crevices
of
doors
and
shutters
and
the
corners
of
doors
and
shutters
shrivelled
and
curled
to
let
out
more
as
though
that
bulging
old
wooden
house
were
a
bursting
reservoir
of
fire
that
could
be
held
in
no
more
and
still
there
were
the
screams
hoarser
and
hoarser
from
what
part
within
was
not
to
be
guessed
my
grandfather
stood
me
in
a
doorway
up
two
steps
and
ran
toward
the
court
but
that
was
impassable
with
such
fearful
swiftness
had
the
fire
sprung
up
and
over
the
dry
old
timber
on
this
side
where
it
had
made
its
beginning
that
already
a
painted
board
on
the
brick
wall
opposite
was
black
and
smoking
and
glowering
red
at
the
edges
and
where
i
stood
across
the
road
the
air
was
hot
and
painful
to
the
eyes
grandfather
nat
ran
along
the
front
of
the
house
to
the
main
door
but
it
was
blazing
and
bursting
and
he
turned
and
ran
into
the
road
with
his
arm
across
his
eyes
then
with
a
suddenly
increased
roar
flames
burst
tenfold
in
volume
and
number
from
all
the
ground
floor
and
where
a
shutter
fell
all
within
glowed
a
sheer
red
furnace
the
spirit
was
caught
at
last
and
now
i
saw
a
sight
that
would
come
again
in
sleep
months
afterwards
and
set
me
screaming
in
my
bed
the
cries
which
had
lately
died
down
sprang
out
anew
amid
the
roar
nearer
and
clearer
with
a
keener
agony
and
up
in
the
the
room
of
the
inquests
there
at
a
window
appeared
the
groping
man
a
dreadful
figure
in
no
darkness
now
but
ringed
about
with
bright
flame
i
saw
him
the
man
whose
empty
sightless
i
had
seen
scarce
twelve
hours
before
through
a
hole
in
a
canvas
screen
the
shade
was
gone
from
over
the
place
of
the
eyes
and
down
the
seared
face
and
among
the
rags
of
blistered
skin
rolled
streams
of
horrible
great
tears
forced
from
the
raw
lids
by
scorching
smoke
his
clothes
smoked
about
him
as
he
stood
groping
groping
still
he
knew
not
whither
and
his
mouth
opened
and
closed
with
sounds
scarce
human
grandfather
nat
roared
distractedly
for
a
ladder
called
to
the
man
to
jump
ran
forward
twice
to
the
face
of
the
house
as
though
to
catch
him
and
twice
came
staggering
back
with
his
hands
over
his
face
and
flying
embers
singeing
his
hair
and
his
coat
the
blind
man
blackened
hands
came
down
on
the
blazing
sill
and
leapt
from
the
touch
then
came
a
great
crash
with
a
single
second
dulling
of
the
whole
blaze
for
an
instant
the
screaming
sightless
weeping
face
remained
and
then
was
gone
for
ever
the
floor
had
fallen
the
flames
went
up
with
a
redoubled
roar
and
now
i
could
hold
my
place
no
longer
for
the
heat
people
were
flinging
water
over
the
shutters
and
doors
of
the
houses
facing
the
fire
and
from
the
houses
adjoining
furniture
was
being
dragged
in
hot
haste
my
grandfather
came
and
carried
me
a
few
doors
farther
along
the
street
and
left
me
with
a
chandler
wife
who
was
out
in
a
shawl
and
a
man
overcoat
over
a
huddle
of
flannel
petticoats
now
the
fire
engines
came
dashing
through
the
narrow
lanes
with
a
clamour
of
hoarse
cries
and
scattering
the
crowd
this
way
and
that
the
hole
in
the
wall
was
past
aid
and
all
the
work
was
given
to
save
its
neighbours
for
some
while
i
could
distinguish
my
grandfather
among
the
firemen
heaving
and
hauling
and
doing
the
work
of
three
the
police
were
grown
in
numbers
now
and
they
had
cleared
the
street
to
beyond
where
i
stood
so
that
i
could
see
well
enough
and
in
every
break
in
the
flames
in
every
changing
shadow
i
saw
again
the
face
of
the
groping
man
even
as
i
can
see
it
now
as
i
write
floor
went
upon
floor
till
at
last
the
poor
old
shell
fell
in
a
heap
amid
a
roar
of
shouts
and
a
last
leap
of
fire
leaving
the
brick
wall
of
the
next
house
cracking
and
black
and
smoking
and
tagged
with
specks
of
dying
flame
and
then
at
last
my
grandfather
black
and
scorched
came
and
sat
by
me
on
a
step
and
put
the
breast
of
his
coat
about
me
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
end
of
its
doubts
and
embarrassments
and
dangers
and
the
beginning
of
another
chapter
in
his
history
his
history
and
mine
chapter
xxx
stephen
tale
little
remains
to
say
for
with
the
smoking
sticks
of
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
tale
of
my
early
days
burns
itself
out
viney
body
was
either
never
found
or
never
identified
whether
it
was
discovered
by
some
person
who
flung
it
adrift
after
possessing
himself
of
the
notes
and
watch
whether
it
was
held
unto
dissolution
by
mud
or
chains
or
waterside
gear
or
whether
indeed
as
was
scarce
possible
it
escaped
with
the
life
in
it
to
walk
the
world
in
some
place
that
knew
it
not
i
at
any
rate
can
not
tell
the
fate
of
his
confederate
at
least
was
no
matter
of
doubt
he
must
have
been
driven
to
the
bar
by
the
fire
he
had
raised
and
there
bewildered
and
helpless
and
cut
off
from
the
way
he
had
come
even
if
he
could
find
it
he
must
have
scrambled
desperately
till
he
found
the
one
open
exit
the
stairs
but
of
these
enough
faint
by
contrast
with
the
vivid
scenes
of
the
night
divers
disconnected
impressions
of
the
next
morning
remain
with
me
all
the
fainter
for
the
sleep
that
clutched
at
my
eyelids
spite
of
my
anxious
resolution
to
see
all
to
the
very
end
of
a
coarse
draggled
woman
of
streaming
face
and
exceeding
bitter
cry
who
sat
inconsolable
while
men
raked
the
ruins
for
a
thing
unrecognisable
when
it
was
found
of
the
pale
man
who
came
staring
and
choking
and
paler
than
ever
gasping
piteously
of
his
long
and
honest
service
and
sitting
down
on
the
curb
at
last
to
meditate
on
my
grandfather
promise
that
he
should
not
want
if
he
would
work
and
of
cripps
at
first
blank
and
speechless
and
then
mighty
loquacious
in
the
matter
of
insurance
for
works
of
art
would
be
included
of
course
up
to
twenty
pounds
apiece
at
which
amount
of
proceeds
with
a
discount
to
captain
kemp
he
would
cheerfully
undertake
to
replace
the
lot
and
throw
the
signboard
in
grimes
was
heard
of
though
not
seen
but
this
was
later
she
was
long
understood
to
have
some
bitter
grievance
against
the
police
whom
she
charged
with
plots
and
conspiracies
to
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
and
i
think
she
ended
with
a
savage
assault
on
a
constable
very
large
whiskers
and
days
imprisonment
the
hole
in
the
wall
was
rebuilt
in
brick
with
another
name
as
i
think
you
may
see
it
still
or
could
till
lately
there
was
also
another
landlord
for
captain
nat
kemp
turned
to
enlarging
and
improving
his
wharf
and
he
bought
lighters
and
wapping
saw
him
no
more
as
for
me
i
went
to
school
at
last
