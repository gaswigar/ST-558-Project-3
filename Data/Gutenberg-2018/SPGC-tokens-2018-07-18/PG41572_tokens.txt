preface
with
this
third
part
of
golden
we
take
up
the
question
why
had
the
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
regularly
to
perish
by
the
hand
of
his
successor
in
the
first
part
of
the
work
i
gave
some
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
priest
of
diana
who
bore
the
title
of
king
of
the
wood
beside
the
still
lake
among
the
alban
hills
personated
the
great
god
jupiter
or
his
duplicate
dianus
the
deity
of
the
oak
the
thunder
and
the
sky
on
this
theory
accordingly
we
are
at
once
confronted
with
the
wider
and
deeper
question
why
put
a
or
human
representative
of
deity
to
a
violent
death
why
extinguish
the
divine
light
in
its
earthly
vessel
instead
of
husbanding
it
to
its
natural
close
my
general
answer
to
that
question
is
contained
in
the
present
volume
if
i
am
right
the
motive
for
slaying
a
is
a
fear
lest
with
the
enfeeblement
of
his
body
in
sickness
or
old
age
his
sacred
spirit
should
suffer
a
corresponding
decay
which
might
imperil
the
general
course
of
nature
and
with
it
the
existence
of
his
worshippers
who
believe
the
cosmic
energies
to
be
mysteriously
knit
up
with
those
of
their
human
divinity
hence
if
there
is
any
measure
of
truth
in
this
theory
the
practice
of
putting
divine
men
and
particularly
divine
kings
to
death
which
seems
to
have
been
common
at
a
particular
stage
in
the
evolution
of
society
and
religion
was
a
crude
but
pathetic
attempt
to
disengage
an
immortal
spirit
from
its
mortal
envelope
to
arrest
the
forces
of
decomposition
in
nature
by
retrenching
with
ruthless
hand
the
first
ominous
symptoms
of
decay
we
may
smile
if
we
please
at
the
vanity
of
these
and
the
like
efforts
to
stay
the
inevitable
decline
to
bring
the
relentless
revolution
of
the
great
wheel
to
a
stand
to
keep
youth
s
fleeting
roses
for
ever
fresh
and
fair
but
perhaps
in
spite
of
every
disillusionment
when
we
contemplate
the
seemingly
endless
vistas
of
knowledge
which
have
been
opened
up
even
within
our
own
generation
many
of
us
may
cherish
in
our
heart
of
hearts
a
fancy
if
not
a
hope
that
some
loophole
of
escape
may
after
all
be
discovered
from
the
iron
walls
of
the
which
threaten
to
close
on
and
crush
us
that
groping
about
in
the
darkness
mankind
may
yet
chance
to
lay
hands
on
that
golden
key
that
opes
the
palace
of
eternity
and
so
to
pass
from
this
world
of
shadows
and
sorrow
to
a
world
of
untroubled
light
and
joy
if
this
is
a
dream
it
is
surely
a
happy
and
innocent
one
and
to
those
who
would
wake
us
from
it
we
may

chapter
i
the
mortality
of
the
gods
at
an
early
stage
of
his
intellectual
development
man
deems
himself
naturally
immortal
and
imagines
that
were
it
not
for
the
baleful
arts
of
sorcerers
who
cut
the
vital
thread
prematurely
short
he
would
live
for
ever
the
illusion
so
flattering
to
human
wishes
and
hopes
is
still
current
among
many
savage
tribes
at
the
present
day
and
it
may
be
supposed
to
have
prevailed
universally
in
that
age
of
magic
which
appears
to
have
everywhere
preceded
the
age
of
religion
but
in
time
the
sad
truth
of
human
mortality
was
borne
in
upon
our
primitive
philosopher
with
a
force
of
demonstration
which
no
prejudice
could
resist
and
no
sophistry
dissemble
among
the
manifold
influences
which
combined
to
wring
from
him
a
reluctant
assent
to
the
necessity
of
death
must
be
numbered
the
growing
influence
of
religion
which
by
exposing
the
vanity
of
magic
and
of
all
the
extravagant
pretensions
built
on
it
gradually
lowered
man
s
proud
and
defiant
attitude
towards
nature
and
taught
him
to
believe
that
there
are
mysteries
in
the
universe
which
his
feeble
intellect
can
never
fathom
and
forces
which
his
puny
hands
can
never
control
thus
more
and
more
he
learned
to
bow
to
the
inevitable
and
to
console
himself
for
the
brevity
and
the
sorrows
of
life
on
earth
by
the
hope
of
a
blissful
eternity
hereafter
but
if
he
reluctantly
acknowledged
the
existence
of
beings
at
once
superhuman
and
supernatural
he
was
as
yet
far
from
suspecting
the
width
and
the
depth
of
the
gulf
which
divided
him
from
them
the
gods
with
whom
his
imagination
now
peopled
the
darkness
of
the
unknown
were
indeed
admitted
by
him
to
be
his
superiors
in
knowledge
and
in
power
in
the
joyous
splendour
of
their
life
and
in
the
length
of
its
duration
but
though
he
knew
it
not
these
glorious
and
awful
beings
were
merely
like
the
spectre
of
the
brocken
the
reflections
of
his
own
diminutive
personality
exaggerated
into
gigantic
proportions
by
distance
and
by
the
mists
and
clouds
upon
which
they
were
cast
man
in
fact
created
gods
in
his
own
likeness
and
being
himself
mortal
he
naturally
supposed
his
creatures
to
be
in
the
same
sad
predicament
thus
the
greenlanders
believed
that
a
wind
could
kill
their
most
powerful
god
and
that
he
would
certainly
die
if
he
touched
a
dog
when
they
heard
of
the
christian
god
they
kept
asking
if
he
never
died
and
being
informed
that
he
did
not
they
were
much
surprised
and
said
that
he
must
be
a
very
great
god
indeed
in
answer
to
the
enquiries
of
colonel
dodge
a
north
american
indian
stated
that
the
world
was
made
by
the
great
spirit
being
asked
which
great
spirit
he
meant
the
good
one
or
the
bad
one
oh
neither
of
replied
he
the
great
spirit
that
made
the
world
is
dead
long
ago
he
could
not
possibly
have
lived
as
long
as
a
tribe
in
the
philippine
islands
told
the
spanish
conquerors
that
the
grave
of
the
creator
was
upon
the
top
of
mount
cabunian
a
god
or
divine
hero
of
the
hottentots
died
several
times
and
came
to
life
again
his
graves
are
generally
to
be
met
with
in
narrow
defiles
between
mountains
when
the
hottentots
pass
one
of
them
they
throw
a
stone
on
it
for
good
luck
sometimes
muttering
give
us
plenty
of
the
grave
of
zeus
the
great
god
of
greece
was
shewn
to
visitors
in
crete
as
late
as
about
the
beginning
of
our
era
the
body
of
dionysus
was
buried
at
delphi
beside
the
golden
statue
of
apollo
and
his
tomb
bore
the
inscription
here
lies
dionysus
dead
the
son
of
according
to
one
account
apollo
himself
was
buried
at
delphi
for
pythagoras
is
said
to
have
carved
an
inscription
on
his
tomb
setting
forth
how
the
god
had
been
killed
by
the
python
and
buried
under
the
tripod
the
ancient
god
cronus
was
buried
in
sicily
and
the
graves
of
hermes
aphrodite
and
ares
were
shewn
in
hermopolis
cyprus
and
thrace
the
great
gods
of
egypt
themselves
were
not
exempt
from
the
common
lot
they
too
grew
old
and
died
for
like
men
they
were
composed
of
body
and
soul
and
like
men
were
subject
to
all
the
passions
and
infirmities
of
the
flesh
their
bodies
it
is
true
were
fashioned
of
more
ethereal
mould
and
lasted
longer
than
ours
but
they
could
not
hold
out
for
ever
against
the
siege
of
time
age
converted
their
bones
into
silver
their
flesh
into
gold
and
their
azure
locks
into
when
their
time
came
they
passed
away
from
the
cheerful
world
of
the
living
to
reign
as
dead
gods
over
dead
men
in
the
melancholy
world
beyond
the
grave
even
their
souls
like
those
of
mankind
could
only
endure
after
death
so
long
as
their
bodies
held
together
and
hence
it
was
as
needful
to
preserve
the
corpses
of
the
gods
as
the
corpses
of
common
folk
lest
with
the
divine
body
the
divine
spirit
should
also
come
to
an
untimely
end
at
first
their
remains
were
laid
to
rest
under
the
desert
sands
of
the
mountains
that
the
dryness
of
the
soil
and
the
purity
of
the
air
might
protect
them
from
putrefaction
and
decay
hence
one
of
the
oldest
titles
of
the
egyptian
gods
is
they
who
are
under
the
but
when
at
a
later
time
the
discovery
of
the
art
of
embalming
gave
a
new
lease
of
life
to
the
souls
of
the
dead
by
preserving
their
bodies
for
an
indefinite
time
from
corruption
the
deities
were
permitted
to
share
the
benefit
of
an
invention
which
held
out
to
gods
as
well
as
to
men
a
reasonable
hope
of
immortality
every
province
then
had
the
tomb
and
mummy
of
its
dead
god
the
mummy
of
osiris
was
to
be
seen
at
mendes
thinis
boasted
of
the
mummy
of
anhouri
and
heliopolis
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
that
of
toumou
but
while
their
bodies
lay
swathed
and
bandaged
here
on
earth
in
the
tomb
their
souls
if
we
may
trust
the
egyptian
priests
shone
as
bright
stars
in
the
firmament
the
soul
of
isis
sparkled
in
sirius
the
soul
of
horus
in
orion
and
the
soul
of
typhon
in
the
great
bear
but
the
death
of
the
god
did
not
involve
the
extinction
of
his
sacred
stock
for
he
commonly
had
by
his
wife
a
son
and
heir
who
on
the
demise
of
his
divine
parent
succeeded
to
the
full
rank
power
and
honours
of
the
godhead
the
high
gods
of
babylon
also
though
they
appeared
to
their
worshippers
only
in
dreams
and
visions
were
conceived
to
be
human
in
their
bodily
shape
human
in
their
passions
and
human
in
their
fate
for
like
men
they
were
born
into
the
world
and
like
men
they
loved
and
fought
and
died
one
of
the
most
famous
stories
of
the
death
of
a
god
is
told
by
plutarch
it
runs
thus
in
the
reign
of
the
emperor
tiberius
a
certain
schoolmaster
named
epitherses
was
sailing
from
greece
to
italy
the
ship
in
which
he
had
taken
his
passage
was
a
merchantman
and
there
were
many
other
passengers
on
board
at
evening
when
they
were
off
the
echinadian
islands
the
wind
died
away
and
the
vessel
drifted
close
in
to
the
island
of
paxos
most
of
the
passengers
were
awake
and
many
were
still
drinking
wine
after
dinner
when
suddenly
a
voice
hailed
the
ship
from
the
island
calling
upon
thamus
the
crew
and
passengers
were
taken
by
surprise
for
though
there
was
an
egyptian
pilot
named
thamus
on
board
few
knew
him
even
by
name
twice
the
cry
was
repeated
but
thamus
kept
silence
however
at
the
third
call
he
answered
and
the
voice
from
the
shore
now
louder
than
ever
said
when
you
are
come
to
palodes
announce
that
the
great
pan
is
astonishment
fell
upon
all
and
they
consulted
whether
it
would
be
better
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
voice
or
not
at
last
thamus
resolved
that
if
the
wind
held
he
would
pass
the
place
in
silence
but
if
it
dropped
when
they
were
off
palodes
he
would
give
the
message
well
when
they
were
come
to
palodes
there
was
a
great
calm
so
thamus
standing
in
the
stern
and
looking
towards
the
land
cried
out
as
he
had
been
bidden
the
great
pan
is
the
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
when
a
loud
sound
of
lamentation
broke
on
their
ears
as
if
a
multitude
were
mourning
this
strange
story
vouched
for
by
many
on
board
soon
got
wind
at
rome
and
thamus
was
sent
for
and
questioned
by
the
emperor
tiberius
himself
who
caused
enquiries
to
be
made
about
the
dead
god
in
modern
times
also
the
annunciation
of
the
death
of
the
great
pan
has
been
much
discussed
and
various
explanations
of
it
have
been
suggested
on
the
whole
the
simplest
and
most
natural
would
seem
to
be
that
the
deity
whose
sad
end
was
thus
mysteriously
proclaimed
and
lamented
was
the
syrian
god
tammuz
or
adonis
whose
death
is
known
to
have
been
annually
bewailed
by
his
followers
both
in
greece
and
in
his
native
syria
at
athens
the
solemnity
fell
at
midsummer
and
there
is
no
improbability
in
the
view
that
in
a
greek
island
a
band
of
worshippers
of
tammuz
should
have
been
celebrating
the
death
of
their
god
with
the
customary
passionate
demonstrations
of
sorrow
at
the
very
time
when
a
ship
lay
becalmed
off
the
shore
and
that
in
the
stillness
of
the
summer
night
the
voices
of
lamentation
should
have
been
wafted
with
startling
distinctness
across
the
water
and
should
have
made
on
the
minds
of
the
listening
passengers
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
however
that
may
be
stories
of
the
same
kind
found
currency
in
western
asia
down
to
the
middle
ages
an
arab
writer
relates
that
in
the
year
or
in
the
reign
of
the
caliph
caiem
a
rumour
went
abroad
through
bagdad
which
soon
spread
all
over
the
province
of
irac
that
some
turks
out
hunting
in
the
desert
had
seen
a
black
tent
where
many
men
and
women
were
beating
their
faces
and
uttering
loud
cries
as
it
is
the
custom
to
do
in
the
east
when
some
one
is
dead
and
among
the
cries
they
distinguished
these
words
the
great
king
of
the
jinn
is
dead
woe
to
this
country
in
consequence
of
this
a
mysterious
threat
was
circulated
from
armenia
to
chuzistan
that
every
town
which
did
not
lament
the
dead
king
of
the
jinn
should
utterly
perish
again
in
the
year
or
a
fatal
disease
which
attacked
the
throat
raged
in
parts
of
mosul
and
irac
and
it
was
divulged
that
a
woman
of
the
jinn
called
umm
uncūd
or
mother
of
the
had
lost
her
son
and
that
all
who
did
not
lament
for
him
would
fall
victims
to
the
epidemic
so
men
and
women
sought
to
save
themselves
from
death
by
assembling
and
beating
their
faces
while
they
cried
out
in
a
lamentable
voice
o
mother

preference
for
a
violent
death
if
the
high
gods
who
dwell
remote
from
the
fret
and
fever
of
this
earthly
life
are
yet
believed
to
die
at
last
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
a
god
who
lodges
in
a
frail
tabernacle
of
flesh
should
escape
the
same
fate
though
we
hear
of
african
kings
who
have
imagined
themselves
immortal
by
virtue
of
their
sorceries
now
primitive
peoples
as
we
have
seen
sometimes
believe
that
their
safety
and
even
that
of
the
world
is
bound
up
with
the
life
of
one
of
these
or
human
incarnations
of
the
divinity
naturally
therefore
they
take
the
utmost
care
of
his
life
out
of
a
regard
for
their
own
but
no
amount
of
care
and
precaution
will
prevent
the
from
growing
old
and
feeble
and
at
last
dying
his
worshippers
have
to
lay
their
account
with
this
sad
necessity
and
to
meet
it
as
best
they
can
the
danger
is
a
formidable
one
for
if
the
course
of
nature
is
dependent
on
the
s
life
what
catastrophes
may
not
be
expected
from
the
gradual
enfeeblement
of
his
powers
and
their
final
extinction
in
death
there
is
only
one
way
of
averting
these
dangers
the
must
be
killed
as
soon
as
he
shews
symptoms
that
his
powers
are
beginning
to
fail
and
his
soul
must
be
transferred
to
a
vigorous
successor
before
it
has
been
seriously
impaired
by
the
threatened
decay
the
advantages
of
thus
putting
the
to
death
instead
of
allowing
him
to
die
of
old
age
and
disease
are
to
the
savage
obvious
enough
for
if
the
dies
what
we
call
a
natural
death
it
means
according
to
the
savage
that
his
soul
has
either
voluntarily
departed
from
his
body
and
refuses
to
return
or
more
commonly
that
it
has
been
extracted
or
at
least
detained
in
its
wanderings
by
a
demon
or
sorcerer
in
any
of
these
cases
the
soul
of
the
is
lost
to
his
worshippers
and
with
it
their
prosperity
is
gone
and
their
very
existence
endangered
even
if
they
could
arrange
to
catch
the
soul
of
the
dying
god
as
it
left
his
lips
or
his
nostrils
and
so
transfer
it
to
a
successor
this
would
not
effect
their
purpose
for
dying
of
disease
his
soul
would
necessarily
leave
his
body
in
the
last
stage
of
weakness
and
exhaustion
and
so
enfeebled
it
would
continue
to
drag
out
a
languid
inert
existence
in
any
body
to
which
it
might
be
transferred
whereas
by
slaying
him
his
worshippers
could
in
the
first
place
make
sure
of
catching
his
soul
as
it
escaped
and
transferring
it
to
a
suitable
successor
and
in
the
second
place
by
putting
him
to
death
before
his
natural
force
was
abated
they
would
secure
that
the
world
should
not
fall
into
decay
with
the
decay
of
the
every
purpose
therefore
was
answered
and
all
dangers
averted
by
thus
killing
the
and
transferring
his
soul
while
yet
at
its
prime
to
a
vigorous
successor
some
of
the
reasons
for
preferring
a
violent
death
to
the
slow
death
of
old
age
or
disease
are
obviously
as
applicable
to
common
men
as
to
the
thus
the
mangaians
think
that
the
spirits
of
those
who
die
a
natural
death
are
excessively
feeble
and
weak
as
their
bodies
were
at
dissolution
whereas
the
spirits
of
those
who
are
slain
in
battle
are
strong
and
vigorous
their
bodies
not
having
been
reduced
by
the
barongo
believe
that
in
the
world
beyond
the
grave
the
spirits
of
their
dead
ancestors
appear
with
the
exact
form
and
lineaments
which
their
bodies
exhibited
at
the
moment
of
death
the
spirits
are
young
or
old
according
as
their
bodies
were
young
or
old
when
they
died
there
are
baby
spirits
who
crawl
about
on
all
fours
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
are
persuaded
that
the
souls
of
the
departed
correspond
exactly
in
form
and
characteristics
to
the
bodies
which
they
quitted
at
death
thus
a
tall
man
is
tall
a
short
man
is
short
and
a
deformed
man
is
deformed
in
the
and
the
disembodied
soul
of
a
child
remains
a
child
it
never
develops
into
an
adult
hence
they
burn
the
body
of
a
murderer
and
scatter
the
ashes
to
the
winds
thinking
that
this
treatment
will
prevent
his
spirit
from
assuming
human
shape
in
the
other
world
so
too
the
naga
tribes
of
manipur
hold
that
the
ghost
of
a
dead
man
is
an
exact
image
of
the
deceased
as
he
was
at
the
moment
of
death
with
his
scars
tattoo
marks
mutilations
and
all
the
rest
the
baganda
think
that
the
ghosts
of
men
who
were
mutilated
in
life
are
mutilated
in
like
manner
after
death
so
to
avoid
that
shame
they
will
rather
die
with
all
their
limbs
than
lose
one
by
amputation
and
live
hence
men
sometimes
prefer
to
kill
themselves
or
to
be
killed
before
they
grow
feeble
in
order
that
in
the
future
life
their
souls
may
start
fresh
and
vigorous
as
they
left
their
bodies
instead
of
decrepit
and
worn
out
with
age
and
disease
thus
in
fiji
is
by
no
means
rare
and
they
believe
that
as
they
leave
this
life
so
they
will
remain
ever
after
this
forms
a
powerful
motive
to
escape
from
decrepitude
or
from
a
crippled
condition
by
a
voluntary
or
as
another
observer
of
the
fijians
puts
it
more
fully
the
custom
of
voluntary
suicide
on
the
part
of
the
old
men
which
is
among
their
most
extraordinary
usages
is
also
connected
with
their
superstitions
respecting
a
future
life
they
believe
that
persons
enter
upon
the
delights
of
their
elysium
with
the
same
faculties
mental
and
physical
that
they
possess
at
the
hour
of
death
in
short
that
the
spiritual
life
commences
where
the
corporeal
existence
terminates
with
these
views
it
is
natural
that
they
should
desire
to
pass
through
this
change
before
their
mental
and
bodily
powers
are
so
enfeebled
by
age
as
to
deprive
them
of
their
capacity
for
enjoyment
to
this
motive
must
be
added
the
contempt
which
attaches
to
physical
weakness
among
a
nation
of
warriors
and
the
wrongs
and
insults
which
await
those
who
are
no
longer
able
to
protect
themselves
when
therefore
a
man
finds
his
strength
declining
with
the
advance
of
age
and
feels
that
he
will
soon
be
unequal
to
discharge
the
duties
of
this
life
and
to
partake
in
the
pleasures
of
that
which
is
to
come
he
calls
together
his
relations
and
tells
them
that
he
is
now
worn
out
and
useless
that
he
sees
they
are
all
ashamed
of
him
and
that
he
has
determined
to
be
so
on
a
day
appointed
they
used
to
meet
and
bury
him
alive
in
vaté
one
of
the
new
hebrides
the
aged
were
buried
alive
at
their
own
request
it
was
considered
a
disgrace
to
the
family
of
an
old
chief
if
he
was
not
buried
alive
of
the
kamants
a
jewish
tribe
in
abyssinia
it
is
reported
that
they
never
let
a
person
die
a
natural
death
but
that
if
any
of
their
relatives
is
nearly
expiring
the
priest
of
the
village
is
called
to
cut
his
throat
if
this
be
omitted
they
believe
that
the
departed
soul
has
not
entered
the
mansions
of
the
the
old
greek
philosopher
heraclitus
thought
that
the
souls
of
those
who
die
in
battle
are
purer
than
the
souls
of
those
who
die
of
disease
among
the
chiriguanos
a
tribe
of
south
american
indians
on
the
river
pilcomayo
when
a
man
was
at
the
point
of
death
his
nearest
relative
used
to
break
his
spine
by
a
blow
of
an
axe
for
they
thought
that
to
die
a
natural
death
was
the
greatest
misfortune
that
could
befall
a
man
whenever
a
payagua
indian
of
paraguay
or
a
guayana
of
brazil
grew
weary
of
life
a
feast
was
made
and
amid
the
revelry
and
dancing
the
man
was
gummed
and
feathered
with
the
plumage
of
birds
a
huge
jar
had
been
previously
fixed
in
the
ground
to
be
ready
for
him
in
this
he
was
placed
the
mouth
of
the
jar
was
covered
with
a
heavy
lid
of
baked
clay
the
earth
was
heaped
over
it
and
thus
he
went
to
his
doom
more
joyful
and
gladsome
than
to
his
first
among
the
koryaks
of
asia
when
a
man
felt
that
his
last
hour
was
come
superstition
formerly
required
that
he
should
either
kill
himself
or
be
killed
by
a
friend
in
order
that
he
might
escape
the
evil
one
and
deliver
himself
up
to
the
good
god
similarly
among
the
chukchees
of
the
same
region
when
a
man
s
strength
fails
and
he
is
tired
of
life
he
requests
his
son
or
other
near
relation
to
despatch
him
indicating
the
manner
of
death
he
prefers
to
die
so
on
a
day
appointed
his
friends
and
neighbours
assemble
and
in
their
presence
he
is
stabbed
strangled
or
otherwise
disposed
of
according
to
his
directions
the
turbulent
angamis
are
the
most
warlike
and
bloodthirsty
of
the
wild
tribes
in
the
valley
of
the
brahmapootra
among
them
when
a
warrior
dies
a
natural
death
his
nearest
male
relative
takes
a
spear
and
wounds
the
corpse
by
a
blow
on
the
head
in
order
that
the
man
may
be
received
with
honour
in
the
other
world
as
one
who
has
died
in
battle
the
heathen
norsemen
believed
that
only
those
who
fell
fighting
were
received
by
odin
in
valhalla
hence
it
appears
to
have
been
customary
to
wound
the
dying
with
a
spear
in
order
to
secure
their
admission
to
the
happy
land
the
custom
may
have
been
a
mitigation
of
a
still
older
practice
of
slaughtering
the
sick
we
know
from
procopius
that
among
the
heruli
a
teutonic
tribe
the
sick
and
old
were
regularly
slain
at
their
own
request
and
then
burned
on
a
pyre
the
wends
used
to
kill
their
aged
parents
and
other
kinsfolk
and
having
killed
them
they
boiled
and
ate
their
bodies
and
the
old
folks
preferred
to
die
thus
rather
than
to
drag
out
a
weary
life
of
weakness
and
decrepitude
kings
killed
when
their
strength
fails
but
it
is
with
the
death
of
the
divine
king
or
we
are
here
especially
concerned
the
mystic
kings
of
fire
and
water
in
cambodia
are
not
allowed
to
die
a
natural
death
hence
when
one
of
them
is
seriously
ill
and
the
elders
think
that
he
can
not
recover
they
stab
him
to
death
the
people
of
congo
believed
as
we
have
seen
that
if
their
pontiff
the
chitomé
were
to
die
a
natural
death
the
world
would
perish
and
the
earth
which
he
alone
sustained
by
his
power
and
merit
would
immediately
be
annihilated
accordingly
when
he
fell
ill
and
seemed
likely
to
die
the
man
who
was
destined
to
be
his
successor
entered
the
pontiff
s
house
with
a
rope
or
a
club
and
strangled
or
clubbed
him
to
death
a
fuller
account
of
this
custom
is
given
by
an
old
italian
writer
as
follows
let
us
pass
to
the
death
of
the
magicians
who
often
die
a
violent
death
and
that
for
the
most
part
voluntarily
i
shall
speak
only
of
the
head
of
this
crew
from
whom
his
followers
take
example
he
is
called
ganga
chitome
being
reputed
god
of
the
earth
the
of
all
the
crops
are
offered
to
him
as
his
due
because
they
are
thought
to
be
produced
by
his
power
and
not
by
nature
at
the
bidding
of
the
most
high
god
this
power
he
boasts
he
can
impart
to
others
when
and
to
whom
he
pleases
he
asserts
that
his
body
can
not
die
a
natural
death
and
therefore
when
he
knows
he
is
near
the
end
of
his
days
whether
it
is
brought
about
by
sickness
or
age
or
whether
he
is
deluded
by
the
demon
he
calls
one
of
his
disciples
to
whom
he
wishes
to
communicate
his
power
in
order
that
he
may
succeed
him
and
having
made
him
tie
a
noose
to
his
neck
he
commands
him
to
strangle
him
or
to
knock
him
on
the
head
with
a
great
cudgel
and
kill
him
his
disciple
obeys
and
sends
him
a
martyr
to
the
devil
to
suffer
torments
with
lucifer
in
the
flames
for
ever
this
tragedy
is
enacted
in
public
in
order
that
his
successor
may
be
manifested
who
hath
the
power
of
fertilising
the
earth
the
power
having
been
imparted
to
him
by
the
deceased
otherwise
so
they
say
the
earth
would
remain
barren
and
the
world
would
perish
oh
too
great
foolishness
and
palpable
blindness
of
the
gentiles
to
enlighten
the
eye
of
whose
mind
there
would
be
needed
the
very
hand
of
christ
whereby
he
opened
the
bodily
eyes
of
him
that
had
been
born
blind
i
know
that
in
my
time
one
of
these
magicians
was
cast
into
the
sea
another
into
a
river
a
mother
put
to
death
with
her
son
and
many
more
seized
by
our
orders
and
the
ethiopian
kings
of
meroe
were
worshipped
as
gods
but
whenever
the
priests
chose
they
sent
a
messenger
to
the
king
ordering
him
to
die
and
alleging
an
oracle
of
the
gods
as
their
authority
for
the
command
this
command
the
kings
always
obeyed
down
to
the
reign
of
ergamenes
a
contemporary
of
ptolemy
king
of
egypt
having
received
a
greek
education
which
emancipated
him
from
the
superstitions
of
his
countrymen
ergamenes
ventured
to
disregard
the
command
of
the
priests
and
entering
the
golden
temple
with
a
body
of
soldiers
put
the
priests
to
the
sword
customs
of
the
same
sort
appear
to
have
prevailed
in
this
region
down
to
modern
times
thus
we
are
told
that
in
fazoql
a
district
in
the
valley
of
the
blue
nile
to
the
west
of
abyssinia
it
was
customary
as
late
as
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
hang
a
king
who
was
no
longer
beloved
his
relatives
and
ministers
assembled
round
him
and
announced
that
as
he
no
longer
pleased
the
men
the
women
the
asses
the
oxen
and
the
fowls
of
the
country
it
was
better
he
should
die
once
on
a
time
when
a
king
was
unwilling
to
take
the
hint
his
own
wife
and
mother
urged
him
so
strongly
not
to
disgrace
himself
by
disregarding
the
custom
that
he
submitted
to
his
fate
and
was
strung
up
in
the
usual
way
in
some
tribes
of
fazoql
the
king
had
to
administer
justice
daily
under
a
certain
tree
if
from
sickness
or
any
other
cause
he
was
unable
to
discharge
this
duty
for
three
whole
days
he
was
hanged
on
the
tree
in
a
noose
which
contained
two
razors
so
arranged
that
when
the
noose
was
drawn
tight
by
the
weight
of
the
king
s
body
they
cut
his
throat
at
fazolglou
an
annual
festival
which
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
saturnalia
was
preceded
by
a
formal
trial
of
the
king
in
front
of
his
house
the
judges
were
the
chief
men
of
the
country
the
king
sat
on
his
royal
stool
during
the
trial
surrounded
by
armed
men
who
were
ready
to
carry
out
a
sentence
of
death
a
little
way
off
a
jackal
and
a
dog
were
tied
to
a
post
the
conduct
of
the
king
during
his
year
of
office
was
discussed
complaints
were
heard
and
if
the
verdict
was
unfavourable
the
king
was
executed
and
his
successor
chosen
from
among
the
members
of
his
family
but
if
the
monarch
was
acquitted
the
people
at
once
paid
their
homage
to
him
afresh
and
the
dog
or
the
jackal
was
killed
in
his
stead
this
custom
lasted
down
to
the
year
or
when
king
yassin
was
thus
condemned
and
executed
his
nephew
assusa
was
compelled
under
threats
of
death
to
succeed
him
in
the
office
afterwards
it
would
seem
that
the
death
of
the
dog
was
regularly
accepted
as
a
substitute
for
the
death
of
the
king
at
least
this
may
be
inferred
from
a
later
account
of
the
fazoql
practice
which
runs
thus
the
meaning
of
another
of
their
customs
is
quite
obscure
at
a
certain
time
of
the
year
they
have
a
kind
of
carnival
where
every
one
does
what
he
likes
best
four
ministers
of
the
king
then
bear
him
on
an
anqareb
out
of
his
house
to
an
open
space
of
ground
a
dog
is
fastened
by
a
long
cord
to
one
of
the
feet
of
the
anqareb
the
whole
population
collects
round
the
place
streaming
in
on
every
side
they
then
throw
darts
and
stones
at
the
dog
till
he
is
killed
after
which
the
king
is
again
borne
into
his
a
custom
of
putting
their
divine
kings
to
death
at
the
first
symptoms
of
infirmity
or
old
age
prevailed
until
lately
if
indeed
it
is
even
now
extinct
and
not
merely
dormant
among
the
shilluk
of
the
white
nile
and
in
recent
years
it
has
been
carefully
investigated
by
seligmann
to
whose
researches
i
am
indebted
for
the
following
detailed
information
on
the
subject
the
shilluk
are
a
tribe
or
nation
who
inhabit
a
long
narrow
fringe
of
territory
on
the
western
bank
of
the
white
nile
from
kaka
in
the
north
to
lake
no
in
the
south
as
well
as
a
strip
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
which
stretches
from
fashoda
to
taufikia
and
for
some
miles
up
the
sobat
river
the
country
of
the
shilluk
is
almost
entirely
in
grass
hence
the
principal
wealth
of
the
people
consists
in
their
flocks
and
herds
but
they
also
grow
a
considerable
quantity
of
the
species
of
millet
which
is
known
as
durra
but
though
the
shilluk
are
mainly
a
pastoral
people
they
are
not
nomadic
but
live
in
many
settled
villages
the
tribe
at
present
numbers
about
forty
thousand
souls
and
is
governed
by
a
single
king
whose
residence
is
at
fashoda
his
subjects
take
great
care
of
him
and
hold
him
in
much
honour
in
the
old
days
his
word
was
law
and
he
was
not
suffered
to
go
forth
to
battle
at
the
present
day
he
still
keeps
up
considerable
state
and
exercises
much
authority
his
decisions
on
all
matters
brought
before
him
are
readily
obeyed
and
he
never
moves
without
a
bodyguard
of
from
twelve
to
twenty
men
the
reverence
which
the
shilluk
pay
to
their
king
appears
to
arise
chiefly
from
the
conviction
that
he
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
spirit
of
nyakang
the
hero
who
founded
the
dynasty
and
settled
the
tribe
in
their
present
territory
to
which
he
is
variously
said
to
have
conducted
them
either
from
the
west
or
from
the
south
tradition
has
preserved
the
pedigree
of
the
kings
from
nyakang
to
the
present
day
the
number
of
kings
recorded
between
nyakang
and
the
father
of
the
reigning
monarch
is
twenty
distributed
over
twelve
generations
but
seligmann
is
of
opinion
that
many
more
must
have
reigned
and
that
the
genealogy
of
the
first
six
or
seven
kings
as
given
to
him
has
been
much
abbreviated
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
the
historical
character
of
all
of
them
though
myths
have
gathered
like
clouds
round
the
persons
of
nyakang
and
his
immediate
successors
the
shilluk
about
kodok
fashoda
think
of
nyakang
as
having
been
a
man
in
appearance
and
physical
qualities
though
unlike
his
royal
descendants
of
more
recent
times
he
did
not
die
but
simply
disappeared
his
holiness
is
manifested
especially
by
his
relation
to
jŭok
the
great
god
of
the
shilluk
who
created
man
and
is
responsible
for
the
order
of
nature
jŭok
is
formless
and
invisible
and
like
the
air
he
is
everywhere
at
once
he
is
far
above
nyakang
and
men
alike
but
he
is
not
worshipped
directly
and
it
is
only
through
the
intercession
of
nyakang
whose
favour
the
shilluk
secure
by
means
of
sacrifices
that
jŭok
can
be
induced
to
send
the
needed
rain
for
the
cattle
and
the
crops
in
his
character
of
nyakang
is
the
great
benefactor
of
the
shilluk
their
country
baked
by
the
burning
heat
of
the
tropical
sun
depends
entirely
for
its
fertility
on
the
waters
of
heaven
for
the
people
do
not
resort
to
artificial
irrigation
when
the
rain
falls
then
the
grass
sprouts
the
millet
grows
the
cattle
thrive
and
the
people
have
food
to
eat
drought
brings
famine
and
death
in
its
train
nyakang
is
said
not
only
to
have
brought
the
shilluk
into
their
present
land
but
to
have
made
them
into
a
nation
of
warriors
divided
the
country
among
them
regulated
marriage
and
made
the
laws
the
religion
of
the
shilluk
at
the
present
time
consists
mainly
of
the
worship
paid
to
this
hero
the
traditionary
ancestor
of
their
kings
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
traditions
concerning
him
are
substantially
correct
in
all
probability
he
was
simply
a
man
whom
the
superstition
of
his
fellows
in
his
own
and
subsequent
ages
has
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
deity
no
less
than
ten
shrines
are
dedicated
to
his
worship
the
three
most
famous
are
at
fashoda
akurwa
and
fenikang
they
consist
of
one
or
more
huts
enclosed
by
a
fence
generally
there
are
several
huts
within
the
enclosure
one
or
more
of
them
being
occupied
by
the
guardians
of
the
shrine
these
guardians
are
old
men
who
not
only
keep
the
hallowed
spot
scrupulously
clean
but
also
act
as
priests
killing
the
sacrificial
victims
which
are
brought
to
the
shrine
sharing
their
flesh
and
taking
the
skins
for
themselves
all
the
shrines
of
nyakang
are
called
graves
of
nyakang
though
it
is
well
known
that
nobody
is
buried
there
sacred
spears
are
kept
in
all
of
them
and
are
used
to
slaughter
the
victims
offered
in
sacrifice
at
the
shrines
the
originals
of
these
spears
are
said
to
have
belonged
to
nyakang
and
his
companions
but
they
have
disappeared
and
been
replaced
by
others
two
great
ceremonies
are
annually
performed
at
the
shrines
of
nyakang
one
of
them
is
intended
to
ensure
the
fall
of
rain
the
other
is
celebrated
at
harvest
at
the
ceremony
which
is
held
before
the
rains
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
a
bullock
is
slain
with
a
sacred
spear
before
the
door
of
the
shrine
while
the
king
stands
by
praying
in
a
loud
voice
to
nyakang
to
send
down
the
refreshing
showers
on
the
thirsty
land
as
much
of
the
blood
of
the
victim
as
possible
is
collected
in
a
gourd
and
thrown
into
the
river
perhaps
as
a
this
intention
of
the
sacrifice
comes
out
more
plainly
in
a
form
of
the
ritual
which
is
said
to
be
observed
at
ashop
there
the
sacrificial
bullock
is
speared
high
up
in
the
flank
so
that
the
wound
is
not
immediately
fatal
then
the
wounded
animal
is
allowed
and
indeed
encouraged
to
walk
to
and
from
the
river
before
it
sinks
down
and
dies
in
the
blood
that
streams
from
its
side
on
the
ground
the
people
may
see
a
symbol
of
the
rain
care
is
taken
not
to
break
the
bones
of
the
animal
and
they
like
the
blood
are
thrown
into
the
river
at
the
annual
ceremony
a
cow
is
also
dedicated
to
nyakang
it
is
not
killed
but
added
to
the
sacred
herd
of
the
shrine
the
other
great
annual
ceremony
observed
at
the
shrines
of
nyakang
falls
at
harvest
when
the
millet
has
been
reaped
every
one
brings
a
portion
of
the
grain
to
a
shrine
of
nyakang
where
it
is
ground
into
flour
which
is
made
into
porridge
with
water
fetched
from
the
river
then
some
of
the
porridge
is
poured
out
on
the
threshold
of
the
hut
which
the
spirit
of
nyakang
is
supposed
to
inhabit
some
of
it
is
smeared
on
the
outer
walls
of
the
building
and
some
of
it
is
emptied
out
on
the
ground
outside
even
before
harvest
it
is
customary
to
bring
some
of
the
ripening
grain
from
the
fields
and
to
thrust
it
into
the
thatch
of
the
huts
in
the
shrines
no
doubt
in
order
to
secure
the
blessing
of
nyakang
on
the
crops
sacrifices
are
also
offered
at
these
shrines
for
the
benefit
of
sick
people
a
sufferer
will
bring
or
send
a
sheep
to
the
nearest
sanctuary
where
the
guardians
will
slaughter
the
animal
with
a
sacred
spear
and
pray
for
the
patient
s
recovery
it
is
a
fundamental
article
of
the
shilluk
creed
that
the
spirit
of
the
divine
or
nyakang
is
incarnate
in
the
reigning
king
who
is
accordingly
himself
invested
to
some
extent
with
the
character
of
a
divinity
but
while
the
shilluk
hold
their
kings
in
high
indeed
religious
reverence
and
take
every
precaution
against
their
accidental
death
nevertheless
they
cherish
the
conviction
that
the
king
must
not
be
allowed
to
become
ill
or
senile
lest
with
his
diminishing
vigour
the
cattle
should
sicken
and
fail
to
bear
their
increase
the
crops
should
rot
in
the
fields
and
man
stricken
with
disease
should
die
in
ever
increasing
to
prevent
these
calamities
it
used
to
be
the
regular
custom
with
the
shilluk
to
put
the
king
to
death
whenever
he
shewed
signs
of
or
failing
strength
one
of
the
fatal
symptoms
of
decay
was
taken
to
be
an
incapacity
to
satisfy
the
sexual
passions
of
his
wives
of
whom
he
has
very
many
distributed
in
a
large
number
of
houses
at
fashoda
when
this
ominous
weakness
manifested
itself
the
wives
reported
it
to
the
chiefs
who
are
popularly
said
to
have
intimated
to
the
king
his
doom
by
spreading
a
white
cloth
over
his
face
and
knees
as
he
lay
slumbering
in
the
heat
of
the
sultry
afternoon
execution
soon
followed
the
sentence
of
death
a
hut
was
specially
built
for
the
occasion
the
king
was
led
into
it
and
lay
down
with
his
head
resting
on
the
lap
of
a
nubile
virgin
the
door
of
the
hut
was
then
walled
up
and
the
couple
were
left
without
food
water
or
fire
to
die
of
hunger
and
suffocation
this
was
the
old
custom
but
it
was
abolished
some
five
generations
ago
on
account
of
the
excessive
sufferings
of
one
of
the
kings
who
perished
in
this
way
he
survived
his
companion
for
some
days
and
in
the
interval
was
so
distressed
by
the
stench
of
her
putrefying
body
that
he
shouted
to
the
people
whom
he
could
hear
moving
outside
never
again
to
let
a
king
die
in
this
prolonged
and
exquisite
agony
after
a
time
his
cries
died
away
into
silence
death
had
released
him
from
his
sufferings
but
since
then
the
shilluk
have
adopted
a
quicker
and
more
merciful
mode
of
executing
their
kings
what
the
exact
form
of
execution
has
been
in
later
times
seligmann
found
it
very
difficult
to
ascertain
though
with
regard
to
the
fact
of
the
execution
he
tells
us
that
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
it
is
said
that
the
chiefs
announce
his
fate
to
the
king
and
that
afterwards
he
is
strangled
in
a
hut
which
has
been
specially
built
for
the
occasion
from
seligmann
s
enquiries
it
appears
that
not
only
was
the
shilluk
king
liable
to
be
killed
with
due
ceremony
at
the
first
symptoms
of
incipient
decay
but
even
while
he
was
yet
in
the
prime
of
health
and
strength
he
might
be
attacked
at
any
time
by
a
rival
and
have
to
defend
his
crown
in
a
combat
to
the
death
according
to
the
common
shilluk
tradition
any
son
of
a
king
had
the
right
thus
to
fight
the
king
in
possession
and
if
he
succeeded
in
killing
him
to
reign
in
his
stead
as
every
king
had
a
large
harem
and
many
sons
the
number
of
possible
candidates
for
the
throne
at
any
time
may
well
have
been
not
inconsiderable
and
the
reigning
monarch
must
have
carried
his
life
in
his
hand
but
the
attack
on
him
could
only
take
place
with
any
prospect
of
success
at
night
for
during
the
day
the
king
surrounded
himself
with
his
friends
and
bodyguards
and
an
aspirant
to
the
throne
could
hardly
hope
to
cut
his
way
through
them
and
strike
home
it
was
otherwise
at
night
for
then
the
guards
were
dismissed
and
the
king
was
alone
in
his
enclosure
with
his
favourite
wives
and
there
was
no
man
near
to
defend
him
except
a
few
herdsmen
whose
huts
stood
a
little
way
off
the
hours
of
darkness
were
therefore
the
season
of
peril
for
the
king
it
is
said
that
he
used
to
pass
them
in
constant
watchfulness
prowling
round
his
huts
fully
armed
peering
into
the
blackest
shadows
or
himself
standing
silent
and
alert
like
a
sentinel
on
duty
in
some
dark
corner
when
at
last
his
rival
appeared
the
fight
would
take
place
in
grim
silence
broken
only
by
the
clash
of
spears
and
shields
for
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
the
king
not
to
call
the
herdsmen
to
his
assistance
when
the
king
did
not
perish
in
single
combat
but
was
put
to
death
on
the
approach
of
sickness
or
old
age
it
became
necessary
to
find
a
successor
for
him
apparently
the
successor
was
chosen
by
the
most
powerful
chiefs
from
among
the
princes
the
sons
either
of
the
late
king
or
of
one
of
his
predecessors
details
as
to
the
mode
of
election
are
lacking
so
far
as
seligmann
could
ascertain
the
kings
elect
shewed
no
reluctance
to
accept
the
fatal
sovereignty
indeed
he
was
told
a
story
of
a
man
who
clamoured
to
be
made
king
for
only
one
day
saying
that
he
was
perfectly
ready
to
be
killed
after
that
the
age
at
which
the
king
was
killed
would
seem
to
have
commonly
been
between
forty
and
fifty
to
the
improvident
and
unimaginative
savage
the
prospect
of
being
put
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
set
time
whether
long
or
short
has
probably
few
terrors
and
if
it
has
any
we
may
suspect
that
they
are
altogether
outweighed
in
his
mind
by
the
opportunities
for
immediate
enjoyment
of
all
kinds
which
a
kingdom
affords
to
his
unbridled
appetites
and
passions
an
important
part
of
the
solemnities
attending
the
accession
of
a
shilluk
king
appears
to
be
intended
to
convey
to
the
new
monarch
the
divine
spirit
of
nyakang
which
has
been
transmitted
from
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
to
all
his
successors
on
the
throne
for
this
purpose
a
sacred
stool
and
a
mysterious
object
which
bears
the
name
of
nyakang
himself
are
brought
with
much
solemnity
from
the
shrine
of
nyakang
at
akurwa
to
the
small
village
of
kwom
near
fashoda
where
the
king
elect
and
the
chiefs
await
their
arrival
the
thing
called
nyakang
is
said
to
be
of
cylindrical
shape
some
two
or
three
feet
long
by
six
inches
broad
the
chief
of
akurwa
informed
seligmann
that
the
object
in
question
is
a
rude
wooden
figure
of
a
man
which
was
fashioned
long
ago
at
the
command
of
nyakang
in
person
we
may
suppose
that
it
represents
the
divine
king
himself
and
that
it
is
or
was
formerly
supposed
to
house
his
spirit
though
the
chief
of
akurwa
denied
to
seligmann
that
it
does
so
now
be
that
as
it
may
the
object
plays
a
prominent
part
at
the
installation
of
a
new
king
when
the
men
of
akurwa
arrive
at
kwom
with
the
sacred
stool
and
the
image
of
nyakang
as
we
may
call
it
they
engage
in
a
sham
fight
with
the
men
who
are
waiting
for
them
with
the
king
elect
the
weapons
used
on
both
sides
are
simply
stalks
of
millet
being
victorious
in
the
mock
combat
the
men
of
akurwa
escort
the
king
to
fashoda
and
some
of
them
enter
the
shrine
of
nyakang
with
the
stool
after
a
short
time
they
bring
the
stool
forth
again
and
set
it
on
the
ground
outside
of
the
sacred
enclosure
then
the
image
of
nyakang
is
placed
on
the
stool
the
king
elect
holds
one
leg
of
the
stool
and
an
important
chief
holds
another
the
king
is
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
princes
and
nobles
and
near
him
stand
two
of
his
paternal
aunts
and
two
of
his
sisters
after
that
a
bullock
is
killed
and
its
flesh
eaten
by
the
men
of
certain
families
called
who
are
said
to
be
descended
from
the
third
of
the
shilluk
kings
then
the
akurwa
men
carry
the
image
of
nyakang
into
the
shrine
and
the
men
place
the
king
elect
on
the
sacred
stool
where
he
remains
seated
for
some
time
apparently
till
sunset
when
he
rises
the
akurwa
men
carry
the
stool
back
into
the
shrine
and
the
king
is
escorted
to
three
new
huts
where
he
stays
in
seclusion
for
three
days
on
the
fourth
night
he
is
conducted
quietly
almost
stealthily
to
his
royal
residence
at
fashoda
and
next
day
he
shews
himself
publicly
to
his
subjects
the
three
new
huts
in
which
he
spent
the
days
of
his
seclusion
are
then
broken
up
and
their
fragments
cast
into
the
river
the
installation
of
a
new
king
generally
takes
place
about
the
middle
of
the
dry
season
and
it
is
said
that
the
men
of
akurwa
tarry
at
fashoda
with
the
image
of
nyakang
till
about
the
beginning
of
the
rains
before
they
leave
fashoda
they
sacrifice
a
bullock
and
at
every
waddy
or
bed
of
a
stream
that
they
cross
they
kill
a
sheep
like
nyakang
himself
their
founder
each
of
the
shilluk
kings
after
death
is
worshipped
at
a
shrine
which
is
erected
over
his
grave
and
the
grave
of
a
king
is
always
in
the
village
where
he
was
born
the
of
a
king
resembles
the
shrine
of
nyakang
consisting
of
a
few
huts
enclosed
by
a
fence
one
of
the
huts
is
built
over
the
king
s
grave
the
others
are
occupied
by
the
guardians
of
the
shrine
indeed
the
shrines
of
nyakang
and
the
shrines
of
the
kings
are
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
each
other
and
the
religious
rituals
observed
at
all
of
them
are
identical
in
form
and
vary
only
in
matters
of
detail
the
variations
being
due
apparently
to
the
far
greater
sanctity
attributed
to
the
shrines
of
nyakang
the
of
the
kings
are
tended
by
certain
old
men
or
women
who
correspond
to
the
guardians
of
the
shrines
of
nyakang
they
are
usually
widows
or
old
of
the
deceased
king
and
when
they
die
they
are
succeeded
in
their
office
by
their
descendants
moreover
cattle
are
dedicated
to
the
of
the
kings
and
sacrifices
are
offered
at
them
just
as
at
the
shrines
of
nyakang
thus
when
the
millet
crop
threatens
to
fail
or
a
murrain
to
break
out
among
the
cattle
either
nyakang
himself
or
one
of
his
successors
on
the
throne
will
appear
to
somebody
in
a
dream
and
demand
a
sacrifice
the
dream
is
reported
to
the
king
who
thereupon
at
once
sends
a
cow
and
a
bullock
to
one
or
more
of
the
shrines
of
nyakang
if
it
was
he
who
appeared
in
the
vision
or
to
the
of
the
particular
king
whom
the
dreamer
saw
in
his
dream
the
bullock
is
then
sacrificed
and
the
cow
added
to
the
sacred
herd
belonging
to
the
shrine
further
the
harvest
ceremony
which
is
performed
at
the
shrines
of
nyakang
is
usually
though
not
necessarily
performed
also
at
the
of
the
kings
and
lastly
sick
folk
send
animals
to
be
sacrificed
as
offerings
on
their
behalf
at
the
shrines
of
the
kings
just
as
they
send
them
to
the
shrines
of
nyakang
sick
people
have
indeed
a
special
reason
for
sacrificing
to
the
spirits
of
the
dead
kings
in
the
hope
of
recovery
inasmuch
as
one
of
the
commonest
causes
of
sickness
according
to
the
shilluk
is
the
entrance
of
one
of
these
royal
spirits
into
the
body
of
the
sufferer
whose
first
care
therefore
is
to
rid
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
of
his
august
but
unwelcome
guest
apparently
however
it
is
only
the
souls
of
the
early
kings
who
manifest
themselves
in
this
disagreeable
fashion
seligmann
met
with
a
woman
for
example
who
had
been
ill
and
who
attributed
her
illness
to
the
spirit
of
dag
the
second
of
the
shilluk
kings
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
body
but
a
sacrifice
of
two
sheep
had
induced
the
spirit
to
quit
her
and
she
wore
anklets
of
beads
with
pieces
of
the
ears
of
the
sheep
strung
on
them
which
she
thought
would
effectually
guard
her
against
the
danger
of
being
again
possessed
by
the
soul
of
the
dead
king
nor
is
it
only
in
sickness
that
the
souls
of
dead
kings
are
thought
to
take
possession
of
the
bodies
of
the
living
certain
men
and
women
who
bear
the
name
of
are
believed
to
be
permanently
possessed
by
the
spirit
of
one
or
other
of
the
early
kings
and
in
virtue
of
this
inspiration
they
profess
to
heal
the
sick
and
do
a
brisk
trade
in
amulets
the
first
symptom
of
possession
may
take
the
form
of
illness
or
of
a
dream
from
which
the
sleeper
awakes
trembling
and
agitated
a
long
and
complicated
ceremony
follows
to
abate
the
extreme
force
of
the
spiritual
manifestations
in
the
new
medium
for
were
these
to
continue
in
their
first
intensity
he
would
not
dare
to
approach
his
women
but
whichever
of
the
dead
kings
may
manifest
himself
to
the
living
whether
in
dreams
or
in
the
form
of
bodily
possession
his
spirit
is
deemed
at
least
by
many
of
the
shilluk
to
be
identical
with
that
of
nyakang
they
do
not
clearly
distinguish
if
indeed
they
distinguish
at
all
between
the
divine
spirit
of
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
and
its
later
manifestations
in
all
his
royal
successors
in
general
the
principal
element
in
the
religion
of
the
shilluk
would
seem
to
be
the
worship
which
they
pay
to
their
sacred
or
divine
kings
whether
dead
or
alive
these
are
believed
to
be
animated
by
a
single
divine
spirit
which
has
been
transmitted
from
the
but
probably
in
substance
historical
founder
of
the
dynasty
through
all
his
successors
to
the
present
day
yet
the
divine
spirit
as
seligmann
justly
observes
is
clearly
not
thought
of
as
congenital
in
the
members
of
the
royal
house
it
is
only
conveyed
to
each
king
on
his
accession
by
means
of
the
mysterious
object
called
nyakang
in
which
as
seligmann
with
great
probability
conjectures
the
holy
spirit
of
nyakang
may
be
supposed
to
reside
hence
regarding
their
kings
as
incarnate
divinities
on
whom
the
welfare
of
men
of
cattle
and
of
the
corn
implicitly
depends
the
shilluk
naturally
pay
them
the
greatest
respect
and
take
every
care
of
them
and
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
us
their
custom
of
putting
the
divine
king
to
death
as
soon
as
he
shews
signs
of
or
failing
strength
springs
directly
from
their
profound
veneration
for
him
and
from
their
anxiety
to
preserve
him
or
rather
the
divine
spirit
by
which
he
is
animated
in
the
most
perfect
state
of
efficiency
nay
we
may
go
further
and
say
that
their
practice
of
regicide
is
the
best
proof
they
can
give
of
the
high
regard
in
which
they
hold
their
kings
for
they
believe
as
we
have
seen
that
the
king
s
life
or
spirit
is
so
sympathetically
bound
up
with
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
country
that
if
he
fell
ill
or
grew
senile
the
cattle
would
sicken
and
cease
to
multiply
the
crops
would
rot
in
the
fields
and
men
would
perish
of
widespread
disease
hence
in
their
opinion
the
only
way
of
averting
these
calamities
is
to
put
the
king
to
death
while
he
is
still
hale
and
hearty
in
order
that
the
divine
spirit
which
he
has
inherited
from
his
predecessors
may
be
transmitted
in
turn
by
him
to
his
successor
while
it
is
still
in
full
vigour
and
has
not
yet
been
impaired
by
the
weakness
of
disease
and
old
age
in
this
connexion
the
particular
symptom
which
is
commonly
said
to
seal
the
king
s
is
highly
significant
when
he
can
no
longer
satisfy
the
passions
of
his
numerous
wives
in
other
words
when
he
has
ceased
whether
partially
or
wholly
to
be
able
to
reproduce
his
kind
it
is
time
for
him
to
die
and
to
make
room
for
a
more
vigorous
successor
taken
along
with
the
other
reasons
which
are
alleged
for
putting
the
king
to
death
this
one
suggests
that
the
fertility
of
men
of
cattle
and
of
the
crops
is
believed
to
depend
sympathetically
on
the
generative
power
of
the
king
so
that
the
complete
failure
of
that
power
in
him
would
involve
a
corresponding
failure
in
men
animals
and
plants
and
would
thereby
entail
at
no
distant
date
the
entire
extinction
of
all
life
whether
human
animal
or
vegetable
no
wonder
that
with
such
a
danger
before
their
eyes
the
shilluk
should
be
most
careful
not
to
let
the
king
die
what
we
should
call
a
natural
death
of
sickness
or
old
age
it
is
characteristic
of
their
attitude
towards
the
death
of
the
kings
that
they
refrain
from
speaking
of
it
as
death
they
do
not
say
that
a
king
has
died
but
simply
that
he
has
gone
away
like
his
divine
ancestors
nyakang
and
dag
the
two
first
kings
of
the
dynasty
both
of
whom
are
reported
not
to
have
died
but
to
have
disappeared
the
similar
legends
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
early
kings
in
other
lands
for
example
at
rome
and
in
uganda
may
well
point
to
a
similar
custom
of
putting
them
to
death
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
their
life
on
the
whole
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
divine
kings
of
the
shilluk
correspond
very
nearly
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
priests
of
nemi
the
kings
of
the
wood
if
my
view
of
the
latter
is
correct
in
both
we
see
a
series
of
divine
kings
on
whose
life
the
fertility
of
men
of
cattle
and
of
vegetation
is
believed
to
depend
and
who
are
put
to
death
whether
in
single
combat
or
otherwise
in
order
that
their
divine
spirit
may
be
transmitted
to
their
successors
in
full
vigour
uncontaminated
by
the
weakness
and
decay
of
sickness
or
old
age
because
any
such
degeneration
on
the
part
of
the
king
would
in
the
opinion
of
his
worshippers
entail
a
corresponding
degeneration
on
mankind
on
cattle
and
on
the
crops
some
points
in
this
explanation
of
the
custom
of
putting
divine
kings
to
death
particularly
the
method
of
transmitting
their
divine
souls
to
their
successors
will
be
dealt
with
more
fully
in
the
sequel
meantime
we
pass
to
other
examples
of
the
general
practice
the
dinka
are
a
congeries
of
independent
tribes
in
the
valley
of
the
white
nile
whose
territory
lying
mostly
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
and
stretching
from
the
sixth
to
the
twelfth
degree
of
north
latitude
has
been
estimated
to
comprise
between
sixty
and
seventy
thousand
square
miles
they
are
a
tall
people
rather
slender
than
fat
with
curly
hair
and
a
complexion
of
the
deepest
black
though
they
are
strong
and
healthy
and
in
general
reach
a
great
age
the
nation
embraces
a
number
of
independent
tribes
and
each
tribe
is
mainly
composed
of
the
owners
of
cattle
for
the
dinka
are
essentially
a
pastoral
people
passionately
devoted
to
the
care
of
their
numerous
herds
of
oxen
though
they
also
keep
sheep
and
goats
and
the
women
cultivate
small
quantities
of
millet
durra
and
sesame
the
tribes
have
no
political
union
each
village
forms
a
separate
community
pasturing
its
herds
together
in
the
same
with
the
change
of
the
seasons
the
people
migrate
with
their
flocks
and
herds
to
and
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
in
summer
when
the
plains
near
the
great
river
are
converted
into
swamps
and
covered
with
clouds
of
mosquitoes
the
herdsmen
and
their
families
drive
their
beasts
to
the
higher
land
of
the
interior
where
the
animals
find
firm
ground
abundant
fodder
and
pools
of
water
at
which
to
slake
their
thirst
in
the
fervour
of
the
noonday
heat
here
in
the
clearings
of
the
forest
the
community
takes
up
its
abode
each
family
dwelling
by
itself
in
one
or
more
conical
huts
enclosed
by
a
strong
fence
of
stakes
and
it
is
in
the
patches
of
open
ground
about
these
dwellings
that
the
women
grow
their
scanty
crops
of
millet
and
sesame
the
mode
of
tillage
is
rude
the
stumps
of
the
trees
which
have
been
felled
are
left
standing
to
a
height
of
several
feet
the
ground
is
hacked
by
the
help
of
a
tool
between
a
hoe
and
a
spade
and
the
weeds
are
uprooted
with
the
hand
such
as
it
is
the
crop
is
exposed
to
the
ravages
of
apes
and
elephants
by
night
and
of
birds
by
day
the
hungry
blacks
do
not
always
wait
till
the
corn
is
ripe
but
eat
much
of
it
while
the
ears
are
still
green
the
cattle
are
kept
in
separate
parks
away
from
the
villages
it
is
in
the
season
of
the
summer
rains
that
the
dinka
are
most
happy
and
prosperous
then
the
cattle
find
sweet
grass
plentiful
water
coolness
and
shade
in
the
forest
then
the
people
subsist
in
comfort
on
the
milk
of
their
flocks
and
herds
supplementing
it
with
the
millet
which
they
reap
and
the
wild
fruits
which
they
gather
in
the
forest
then
they
brew
the
native
beer
then
they
marry
and
dance
by
night
under
the
bright
moon
of
the
serene
tropical
sky
but
in
autumn
a
great
change
passes
over
the
life
of
the
community
when
october
has
come
the
rains
are
over
the
grass
of
the
pastures
is
eaten
down
or
withered
the
pools
are
dry
thirst
compels
the
whole
village
with
its
lowing
herds
and
bleating
flocks
to
migrate
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
river
now
begins
a
time
of
privation
and
suffering
there
is
no
grass
for
the
cattle
save
in
some
marshy
spots
where
the
herdsman
must
fight
his
rivals
in
order
to
win
a
meagre
supply
of
fodder
for
his
starveling
beasts
there
is
no
milk
for
the
people
no
fruits
on
the
trees
except
a
bitter
sort
of
acorns
from
which
a
miserable
flour
is
ground
to
stay
the
pangs
of
hunger
the
lean
and
famished
natives
are
driven
to
fish
in
the
river
for
the
tubers
of
to
grub
in
the
earth
for
roots
to
boil
the
leaves
of
trees
and
as
a
last
resource
to
drink
the
blood
drawn
from
the
necks
of
their
wretched
cattle
the
gaunt
appearance
of
the
people
at
this
season
fills
the
beholder
with
horror
the
herds
are
decimated
by
famine
but
even
more
beasts
perish
by
dysentery
and
other
diseases
when
the
first
rains
cause
the
fresh
grass
to
sprout
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
rain
on
which
the
dinka
are
so
manifestly
dependent
for
their
subsistence
should
play
a
great
part
in
their
religion
and
superstition
they
worship
a
supreme
being
whose
name
of
dengdit
means
literally
great
rain
it
was
he
who
created
the
world
and
established
the
present
order
of
things
and
it
is
he
who
sends
down
the
rain
from
the
his
home
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
air
but
according
to
the
niel
dinka
this
great
being
was
once
incarnate
in
human
form
born
of
a
woman
who
descended
from
the
sky
he
became
the
ancestor
of
a
clan
which
has
the
rain
for
its
totem
for
the
recent
researches
of
seligmann
have
proved
that
every
dinka
tribe
is
divided
into
a
number
of
clans
each
of
which
reveres
as
its
totem
a
species
of
animals
or
plants
or
other
natural
objects
such
as
rain
or
fire
animal
totems
seem
to
be
the
commonest
amongst
them
are
the
lion
the
elephant
the
crocodile
the
hippopotamus
the
fox
the
hyaena
and
a
species
of
small
birds
called
clouds
of
which
infest
the
cornfields
and
do
great
damage
to
the
crops
each
clan
speaks
of
its
totemic
animal
or
plant
as
its
ancestor
and
refrains
from
injuring
and
eating
it
men
of
the
crocodile
clan
for
example
call
themselves
brothers
of
the
crocodile
and
will
neither
kill
nor
eat
the
animal
indeed
they
will
not
even
eat
out
of
any
vessel
which
has
held
crocodile
flesh
and
as
they
do
not
injure
crocodiles
so
they
imagine
that
their
crocodile
kinsfolk
will
not
injure
them
hence
men
of
this
clan
swim
freely
in
the
river
even
by
night
without
fear
of
being
attacked
by
the
dangerous
reptiles
and
when
the
totem
is
a
carnivorous
animal
members
of
the
clan
may
propitiate
it
by
killing
sheep
and
throwing
out
the
flesh
to
be
devoured
by
their
animal
brethren
either
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
or
in
the
river
members
of

to
prevent
the

from
injuring

the
relationship
between
a
clan
and
its
animal
ancestor
or
totem
is
commonly
explained
by
a
legend
that
in
the
beginning
an
ancestress
gave
birth
to
twins
one
of
whom
was
the
totemic
animal
and
the
other
the
human
ancestor
like
most
totemic
clans
the
clans
of
the
dinka
are
exogamous
that
is
no
man
may
marry
a
woman
of
his
own
clan
the
descent
of
the
clans
is
in
the
paternal
line
in
other
words
every
man
and
woman
belongs
to
his
or
her
father
s
clan
not
to
that
of
his
or
her
mother
but
the
rain
clan
of
the
niel
dinka
has
for
its
ancestor
as
we
have
seen
the
supreme
god
himself
who
deigned
to
be
born
of
a
woman
and
to
live
for
a
long
time
among
men
ruling
over
them
till
at
last
he
grew
very
old
and
disappeared
appropriately
like
romulus
in
a
great
storm
of
rain
shrines
erected
in
his
honour
appear
to
be
scattered
all
over
the
dinka
country
and
offerings
are
made
at
them
perhaps
without
being
unduly
rash
we
may
conjecture
that
the
great
god
of
the
dinka
who
gives
them
the
rain
was
indeed
what
tradition
represents
him
as
having
been
a
man
among
men
in
fact
a
human
whom
at
his
death
the
superstition
of
his
fellows
promoted
to
the
rank
of
a
deity
above
the
clouds
be
that
as
it
may
the
human
is
a
very
important
personage
among
the
dinka
to
this
day
indeed
the
men
in
authority
whom
travellers
dub
chiefs
or
sheikhs
are
in
fact
the
actual
or
potential
of
the
tribe
or
community
each
of
them
is
believed
to
be
animated
by
the
spirit
of
a
great
which
has
come
down
to
him
through
a
succession
of
and
in
virtue
of
this
inspiration
a
successful
enjoys
very
great
power
and
is
consulted
on
all
important
matters
for
example
in
the
bor
tribe
of
dinka
at
the
present
time
there
is
an
old
but
active
named
biyordit
who
is
reputed
to
have
immanent
in
him
a
great
and
powerful
spirit
called
lerpiu
and
by
reason
of
this
reputation
he
exercises
immense
influence
over
all
the
dinka
of
the
bor
and
tain
tribes
while
the
mighty
spirit
lerpiu
is
supposed
to
be
embodied
in
the
it
is
also
thought
to
inhabit
a
certain
hut
which
serves
as
a
shrine
in
front
of
the
hut
stands
a
post
to
which
are
fastened
the
horns
of
many
bullocks
that
have
been
sacrificed
to
lerpiu
and
in
the
hut
is
kept
a
very
sacred
spear
which
bears
the
name
of
lerpiu
and
is
said
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
six
generations
ago
as
fallen
stars
are
also
called
lerpiu
we
may
suspect
that
an
intimate
connexion
is
supposed
to
exist
between
meteorites
and
the
spirit
which
animates
the
nor
would
such
a
connexion
seem
unnatural
to
the
savage
who
observes
that
meteorites
and
rain
alike
descend
from
the
sky
in
spring
about
the
month
of
april
when
the
new
moon
is
a
few
days
old
a
sacrifice
of
bullocks
is
offered
to
lerpiu
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
him
to
move
dengdit
the
great
heavenly
to
send
down
rain
on
the
parched
and
thirsty
earth
two
bullocks
are
led
twice
round
the
shrine
and
afterwards
tied
by
the
to
the
post
in
front
of
it
then
the
drums
beat
and
the
people
old
and
young
men
and
women
dance
round
the
shrine
and
sing
while
the
beasts
are
being
sacrificed
lerpiu
our
ancestor
we
have
brought
you
a
sacrifice
be
pleased
to
cause
rain
to
the
blood
of
the
bullocks
is
collected
in
a
gourd
boiled
in
a
pot
on
the
fire
and
eaten
by
the
old
and
important
people
of
the
clan
the
horns
of
the
animals
are
attached
to
the
post
in
front
of
the
shrine
in
spite
or
rather
in
virtue
of
the
high
honour
in
which
he
is
held
no
dinka
is
allowed
to
die
a
natural
death
of
sickness
or
old
age
for
the
dinka
believe
that
if
such
an
untoward
event
were
to
happen
the
tribe
would
suffer
from
disease
and
famine
and
the
herds
would
not
yield
their
increase
so
when
a
feels
that
he
is
growing
old
and
infirm
he
tells
his
children
that
he
wishes
to
die
among
the
agar
dinka
a
large
grave
is
dug
and
the
lies
down
in
it
on
his
right
side
with
his
head
resting
on
a
skin
he
is
surrounded
by
his
friends
and
relatives
including
his
younger
children
but
his
elder
children
are
not
allowed
to
approach
the
grave
lest
in
their
grief
and
despair
they
should
do
themselves
a
bodily
injury
for
many
hours
generally
for
more
than
a
day
the
lies
without
eating
or
drinking
from
time
to
time
he
speaks
to
the
people
recalling
the
past
history
of
the
tribe
reminding
them
how
he
has
ruled
and
advised
them
and
instructing
them
how
they
are
to
act
in
the
future
then
when
he
has
concluded
his
admonition
he
tells
them
that
it
is
finished
and
bids
them
cover
him
up
so
the
earth
is
thrown
down
on
him
as
he
lies
in
the
grave
and
he
soon
dies
of
suffocation
such
with
minor
variations
appears
to
be
the
regular
end
of
the
honourable
career
of
a
in
all
the
dinka
tribes
the
dinka
told
seligmann
that
when
they
have
dug
the
grave
for
their
they
strangle
him
in
his
house
the
father
and
paternal
uncle
of
one
of
seligmann
s
informants
had
both
been
and
both
had
been
killed
in
the
most
regular
and
orthodox
fashion
even
if
a
is
quite
young
he
will
be
put
to
death
should
he
seem
likely
to
perish
of
disease
further
every
precaution
is
taken
to
prevent
a
from
dying
an
accidental
death
for
such
an
end
though
not
nearly
so
serious
a
matter
as
death
from
illness
or
old
age
would
be
sure
to
entail
sickness
on
the
tribe
as
soon
as
a
is
killed
his
valuable
spirit
is
supposed
to
pass
to
a
suitable
successor
whether
a
son
or
other
near
blood
relation
in
the
central
african
kingdom
of
unyoro
down
to
recent
years
custom
required
that
as
soon
as
the
king
fell
seriously
ill
or
began
to
break
up
from
age
he
should
die
by
his
own
hand
for
according
to
an
old
prophecy
the
throne
would
pass
away
from
the
dynasty
if
ever
the
king
were
to
die
a
natural
death
he
killed
himself
by
draining
a
poisoned
cup
if
he
faltered
or
were
too
ill
to
ask
for
the
cup
it
was
his
wife
s
duty
to
administer
the
poison
when
the
king
of
kibanga
on
the
upper
congo
seems
near
his
end
the
sorcerers
put
a
rope
round
his
neck
which
they
draw
gradually
tighter
till
he
dies
if
the
king
of
gingero
happens
to
be
wounded
in
war
he
is
put
to
death
by
his
comrades
or
if
they
fail
to
kill
him
by
his
kinsfolk
however
hard
he
may
beg
for
mercy
they
say
they
do
it
that
he
may
not
die
by
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
jukos

a
heathen
tribe
of
the
benue
river
a
great
tributary
of
the
niger
in
their
country
the
town
of
gatri
is
ruled
by
a
king
who
is
elected
by
the
big
men
of
the
town
as
follows
when
in
the
opinion
of
the
big
men
the
king
has
reigned
long
enough
they
give
out
that
the
king
is
sick
formula
understood
by
all
to
mean
that
they
are
going
to
kill
him
though
the
intention
is
never
put
more
plainly
they
then
decide
who
is
to
be
the
next
king
how
long
he
is
to
reign
is
settled
by
the
influential
men
at
a
meeting
the
question
is
put
and
answered
by
each
man
throwing
on
the
ground
a
little
piece
of
stick
for
each
year
he
thinks
the
new
king
should
rule
the
king
is
then
told
and
a
great
feast
prepared
at
which
the
king
gets
drunk
on
beer
after
that
he
is
speared
and
the
man
who
was
chosen
becomes
king
thus
each
juko
king
knows
that
he
can
not
have
very
many
more
years
to
live
and
that
he
is
certain
of
his
predecessor
s
fate
this
however
does
not
seem
to
frighten
candidates
the
same
custom
of
is
said
to
prevail
at
quonde
and
wukari
as
well
as
at
in
the
three
hausa
kingdoms
of
gobir
katsina
and
daura
in
northern
nigeria
as
soon
as
a
king
shewed
signs
of
failing
health
or
growing
infirmity
an
official
who
bore
the
title
of
killer
of
the
elephant
appeared
and
throttled
him
by
holding
his
windpipe
the
king
elect
was
afterwards
conducted
to
the
centre
of
the
town
called
head
of
the
elephant
where
he
was
made
to
lie
down
on
a
bed
then
a
black
ox
was
slaughtered
and
its
blood
allowed
to
pour
all
over
his
body
next
the
ox
was
flayed
and
the
remains
of
the
dead
king
which
had
been
disembowelled
and
smoked
for
seven
days
over
a
slow
fire
were
wrapt
up
in
the
hide
and
dragged
along
the
ground
to
the
place
of
burial
where
they
were
interred
in
a
circular
pit
after
his
bath
of
ox
blood
the
new
king
had
to
remain
for
seven
days
in
his
mother
s
house
undergoing
ablutions
daily
on
the
eighth
day
he
was
conducted
in
state
to
his
palace
in

kingdom
of

the
new
monarch

moreover
to
step
over

corpse
of
his
predecessor
the
matiamvo

a
great
king
or
emperor
in
the
interior
of
angola
one
of
the
inferior
kings
of
the
country
by
name
challa
gave
to
a
portuguese
expedition
the
following
account
of
the
manner
in
which
the
matiamvo
comes
by
his
end
it
has
been
customary
he
said
for
our
matiamvos
to
die
either
in
war
or
by
a
violent
death
and
the
present
matiamvo
must
meet
this
last
fate
as
in
consequence
of
his
great
exactions
he
has
lived
long
enough
when
we
come
to
this
understanding
and
decide
that
he
should
be
killed
we
invite
him
to
make
war
with
our
enemies
on
which
occasion
we
all
accompany
him
and
his
family
to
the
war
when
we
lose
some
of
our
people
if
he
escapes
unhurt
we
return
to
the
war
again
and
fight
for
three
or
four
days
we
then
suddenly
abandon
him
and
his
family
to
their
fate
leaving
him
in
the
enemy
s
hands
seeing
himself
thus
deserted
he
causes
his
throne
to
be
erected
and
sitting
down
calls
his
family
around
him
he
then
orders
his
mother
to
approach
she
kneels
at
his
feet
he
first
cuts
off
her
head
then
decapitates
his
sons
in
succession
next
his
wives
and
relatives
and
last
of
all
his
most
beloved
wife
called
anacullo
this
slaughter
being
accomplished
the
matiamvo
dressed
in
all
his
pomp
awaits
his
own
death
which
immediately
follows
by
an
officer
sent
by
the
powerful
neighbouring
chiefs
caniquinha
and
canica
this
officer
first
cuts
off
his
legs
and
arms
at
the
joints
and
lastly
he
cuts
off
his
head
after
which
the
head
of
the
officer
is
struck
off
all
the
potentates
retire
from
the
encampment
in
order
not
to
witness
his
death
it
is
my
duty
to
remain
and
witness
his
death
and
to
mark
the
place
where
the
head
and
arms
have
been
deposited
by
the
two
great
chiefs
the
enemies
of
the
matiamvo
they
also
take
possession
of
all
the
property
belonging
to
the
deceased
monarch
and
his
family
which
they
convey
to
their
own
residence
i
then
provide
for
the
funeral
of
the
mutilated
remains
of
the
late
matiamvo
after
which
i
retire
to
his
capital
and
proclaim
the
new
government
i
then
return
to
where
the
head
legs
and
arms
have
been
deposited
and
for
forty
slaves
i
ransom
them
together
with
the
merchandise
and
other
property
belonging
to
the
deceased
which
i
give
up
to
the
new
matiamvo
who
has
been
proclaimed
this
is
what
has
happened
to
many
matiamvos
and
what
must
happen
to
the
present
it
appears
to
have
been
a
zulu
custom
to
put
the
king
to
death
as
soon
as
he
began
to
have
wrinkles
or
grey
hairs
at
least
this
seems
implied
in
the
following
passage
written
by
one
who
resided
for
some
time
at
the
court
of
the
notorious
zulu
tyrant
chaka
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
extraordinary
violence
of
the
king
s
rage
with
me
was
mainly
occasioned
by
that
absurd
nostrum
the
hair
oil
with
the
notion
of
which
farewell
had
impressed
him
as
being
a
specific
for
removing
all
indications
of
age
from
the
first
moment
of
his
having
heard
that
such
a
preparation
was
attainable
he
evinced
a
solicitude
to
procure
it
and
on
every
occasion
never
forgot
to
remind
us
of
his
anxiety
respecting
it
more
especially
on
our
departure
on
the
mission
his
injunctions
were
particularly
directed
to
this
object
it
will
be
seen
that
it
is
one
of
the
barbarous
customs
of
the
zoolas
in
their
choice
or
election
of
their
kings
that
he
must
neither
have
wrinkles
nor
grey
hairs
as
they
are
both
distinguishing
marks
of
disqualification
for
becoming
a
monarch
of
a
warlike
people
it
is
also
equally
indispensable
that
their
king
should
never
exhibit
those
proofs
of
having
become
unfit
and
incompetent
to
reign
it
is
therefore
important
that
they
should
conceal
these
indications
so
long
as
they
possibly
can
chaka
had
become
greatly
apprehensive
of
the
approach
of
grey
hairs
which
would
at
once
be
the
signal
for
him
to
prepare
to
make
his
exit
from
this
sublunary
world
it
being
always
followed
by
the
death
of
the
the
writer
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
this
instructive
anecdote
of
the
omits
to
specify
the
mode
in
which
a
and
wrinkled
zulu
chief
used
to
make
his
exit
from
this
sublunary
world
but
on
analogy
we
may
conjecture
that
he
did
so
by
the
simple
and
perfectly
sufficient
process
of
being
knocked
on
the
head
the
custom
of
putting
kings
to
death
as
soon
as
they
suffered
from
any
personal
defect
prevailed
two
centuries
ago
in
the
caffre
kingdom
of
sofala
to
the
north
of
the
present
zululand
we
have
seen
that
these
kings
of
sofala
each
of
whom
bore
the
official
name
of
quiteve
were
regarded
as
gods
by
their
people
being
entreated
to
give
rain
or
sunshine
according
as
each
might
be
wanted
nevertheless
a
slight
bodily
blemish
such
as
the
loss
of
a
tooth
was
considered
a
sufficient
cause
for
putting
one
of
these
to
death
as
we
learn
from
the
following
passage
of
an
old
portuguese
historian
it
was
formerly
the
custom
of
the
kings
of
this
land
to
commit
suicide
by
taking
poison
when
any
disaster
or
natural
physical
defect
fell
upon
them
such
as
impotence
infectious
disease
the
loss
of
their
front
teeth
by
which
they
were
disfigured
or
any
other
deformity
or
affliction
to
put
an
end
to
such
defects
they
killed
themselves
saying
that
the
king
should
be
free
from
any
blemish
and
if
not
it
was
better
for
his
honour
that
he
should
die
and
seek
another
life
where
he
would
be
made
whole
for
there
everything
was
perfect
but
the
quiteve
who
reigned
when
i
was
in
those
parts
would
not
imitate
his
predecessors
in
this
being
discreet
and
dreaded
as
he
was
for
having
lost
a
front
tooth
he
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
kingdom
that
all
should
be
aware
that
he
had
lost
a
tooth
and
should
recognise
him
when
they
saw
him
without
it
and
if
his
predecessors
killed
themselves
for
such
things
they
were
very
foolish
and
he
would
not
do
so
on
the
contrary
he
would
be
very
sorry
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
die
a
natural
death
for
his
life
was
very
necessary
to
preserve
his
kingdom
and
defend
it
from
his
enemies
and
he
recommended
his
successors
to
follow
his
the
same
historian
tells
us
that
near
the
kingdom
of
quiteve
is
another
of
which
sedanda
is
king
the
laws
and
customs
of
which
are
very
similar
to
those
of
quiteve
all
these
kaffirs
being
of
the
same
nation
and
these
two
kingdoms
having
formerly
been
one
as
i
shall
relate
hereafter
when
i
was
in
sofala
it
happened
that
king
sedanda
was
seized
with
a
severe
and
contagious
leprosy
and
seeing
that
his
complaint
was
incurable
having
named
the
prince
who
was
to
succeed
him
he
took
poison
and
died
according
to
the
custom
of
those
kings
when
they
are
afflicted
with
any
physical
the
king
of
sofala
who
dared
to
survive
the
loss
of
his
front
tooth
was
thus
a
bold
reformer
like
ergamenes
king
of
ethiopia
we
may
conjecture
that
the
ground
for
putting
the
ethiopian
kings
to
death
was
as
in
the
case
of
the
zulu
and
sofala
kings
the
appearance
on
their
person
of
any
bodily
defect
or
sign
of
decay
and
that
the
oracle
which
the
priests
alleged
as
the
authority
for
the
royal
execution
was
to
the
effect
that
great
calamities
would
result
from
the
reign
of
a
king
who
had
any
blemish
on
his
body
just
as
an
oracle
warned
sparta
against
a
lame
reign
that
is
the
reign
of
a
lame
king
it
is
some
confirmation
of
this
conjecture
that
the
kings
of
ethiopia
were
chosen
for
their
size
strength
and
beauty
long
before
the
custom
of
killing
them
was
abolished
to
this
day
the
sultan
of
wadai
must
have
no
obvious
bodily
defect
and
the
king
of
angoy
can
not
be
crowned
if
he
has
a
single
blemish
such
as
a
broken
or
a
filed
tooth
or
the
scar
of
an
old
wound
according
to
the
book
of
acaill
and
many
other
authorities
no
king
who
was
afflicted
with
a
personal
blemish
might
reign
over
ireland
at
tara
hence
when
the
great
king
cormac
mac
art
lost
one
eye
by
an
accident
he
at
once
abdicated
it
is
only
natural
therefore
to
suppose
especially
with
the
other
african
examples
before
us
that
any
bodily
defect
or
symptom
of
old
age
appearing
on
the
person
of
the
ethiopian
monarch
was
the
signal
for
his
execution
at
a
later
time
it
is
recorded
that
if
the
king
of
ethiopia
became
maimed
in
any
part
of
his
body
all
his
courtiers
had
to
suffer
the
same
mutilation
but
this
rule
may
perhaps
have
been
instituted
at
the
time
when
the
custom
of
killing
the
king
for
any
personal
defect
was
abolished
instead
of
compelling
the
king
to
die
because
for
example
he
had
lost
a
tooth
all
his
subjects
would
be
obliged
to
lose
a
tooth
and
thus
the
invidious
superiority
of
the
subjects
over
the
king
would
be
cancelled
a
rule
of
this
sort
is
still
observed
in
the
same
region
at
the
court
of
the
sultans
of
darfur
when
the
sultan
coughs
every
one
makes
the
sound
by
striking
the
tongue
against
the
root
of
the
upper
teeth
when
he
sneezes
the
whole
assembly
utters
a
sound
like
the
cry
of
the
jeko
when
he
falls
off
his
horse
all
his
followers
must
fall
off
likewise
if
any
one
of
them
remains
in
the
saddle
no
matter
how
high
his
rank
he
is
laid
on
the
ground
and
beaten
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
uganda
in
central
africa
when
the
king
laughs
every
one
laughs
when
he
sneezes
every
one
sneezes
when
he
has
a
cold
every
one
pretends
to
have
a
cold
when
he
has
his
hair
cut
so
has
everybody
at
the
court
of
boni
in
celebes
it
is
a
rule
that
whatever
the
king
does
all
the
courtiers
must
do
if
he
stands
they
stand
if
he
sits
they
sit
if
he
falls
off
his
horse
they
fall
off
their
horses
if
he
bathes
they
bathe
and
must
go
into
the
water
in
the
dress
good
or
bad
which
they
happen
to
have
on
when
the
emperor
of
china
laughs
the
mandarins
in
attendance
laugh
also
when
he
stops
laughing
they
stop
when
he
is
sad
their
countenances
are
chopfallen
you
would
say
that
their
faces
are
on
springs
and
that
the
emperor
can
touch
the
springs
and
set
them
in
motion
at
but
to
return
to
the
death
of
the
divine
king
many
days
journey
to
the
of
abomey
the
old
capital
of
dahomey
lies
the
kingdom
of
eyeo
the
eyeos
are
governed
by
a
king
no
less
absolute
than
the
king
of
dahomy
yet
subject
to
a
regulation
of
state
at
once
humiliating
and
extraordinary
when
the
people
have
conceived
an
opinion
of
his
which
is
sometimes
insidiously
infused
into
them
by
the
artifice
of
his
discontented
ministers
they
send
a
deputation
to
him
with
a
present
of
parrots
eggs
as
a
mark
of
its
authenticity
to
represent
to
him
that
the
burden
of
government
must
have
so
far
fatigued
him
that
they
consider
it
full
time
for
him
to
repose
from
his
cares
and
indulge
himself
with
a
little
sleep
he
thanks
his
subjects
for
their
attention
to
his
ease
retires
to
his
own
apartment
as
if
to
sleep
and
there
gives
directions
to
his
women
to
strangle
him
this
is
immediately
executed
and
his
son
quietly
ascends
the
throne
upon
the
usual
terms
of
holding
the
reins
of
government
no
longer
than
whilst
he
merits
the
approbation
of
the
about
the
year
a
king
of
eyeo
whom
his
ministers
attempted
to
remove
in
the
customary
manner
positively
refused
to
accept
the
proffered
parrots
eggs
at
their
hands
telling
them
that
he
had
no
mind
to
take
a
nap
but
on
the
contrary
was
resolved
to
watch
for
the
benefit
of
his
subjects
the
ministers
surprised
and
indignant
at
his
recalcitrancy
raised
a
rebellion
but
were
defeated
with
great
slaughter
and
thus
by
his
spirited
conduct
the
king
freed
himself
from
the
tyranny
of
his
councillors
and
established
a
new
precedent
for
the
guidance
of
his
successors
however
the
old
custom
seems
to
have
revived
and
persisted
until
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
for
a
catholic
missionary
writing
in
speaks
of
the
practice
as
if
it
were
still
in
vogue
another
missionary
writing
in
thus
describes
the
usage
of
the
egbas
and
the
yorubas
of
west
africa
among
the
customs
of
the
country
one
of
the
most
curious
is
unquestionably
that
of
judging
and
punishing
the
king
should
he
have
earned
the
hatred
of
his
people
by
exceeding
his
rights
one
of
his
councillors
on
whom
the
heavy
duty
is
laid
requires
of
the
prince
that
he
shall
go
to
sleep
which
means
simply
take
poison
and
if
his
courage
fails
him
at
the
supreme
moment
a
friend
renders
him
this
last
service
and
quietly
without
betraying
the
secret
they
prepare
the
people
for
the
news
of
the
king
s
death
in
yoruba
the
thing
is
managed
a
little
differently
when
a
son
is
born
to
the
king
of
oyo
they
make
a
model
of
the
infant
s
right
foot
in
clay
and
keep
it
in
the
house
of
the
elders
if
the
king
fails
to
observe
the
customs
of
the
country
a
messenger
without
speaking
a
word
shews
him
his
child
s
foot
the
king
knows
what
that
means
he
takes
poison
and
goes
to
the
old
prussians
acknowledged
as
their
supreme
lord
a
ruler
who
governed
them
in
the
name
of
the
gods
and
was
known
as
god
s
mouth
when
he
felt
himself
weak
and
ill
if
he
wished
to
leave
a
good
name
behind
him
he
had
a
great
heap
made
of
and
straw
on
which
he
mounted
and
delivered
a
long
sermon
to
the
people
exhorting
them
to
serve
the
gods
and
promising
to
go
to
the
gods
and
speak
for
the
people
then
he
took
some
of
the
perpetual
fire
which
burned
in
front
of
the
holy
and
lighting
the
pile
with
it
burned
himself
to
death
we
need
not
doubt
the
truth
of
this
last
tradition
fanaticism
or
the
mere
love
of
notoriety
has
led
men
in
other
ages
and
other
lands
to
court
death
in
the
flames
in
antiquity
the
mountebank
peregrinus
after
bidding
for
fame
in
the
various
characters
of
a
christian
martyr
a
shameless
cynic
and
a
rebel
against
rome
ended
his
disreputable
and
vainglorious
career
by
publicly
burning
himself
at
the
olympic
festival
in
the
presence
of
a
crowd
of
admirers
and
scoffers
among
whom
was
the
satirist
lucian
buddhist
monks
in
china
sometimes
seek
to
attain
nirvana
by
the
same
method
the
flame
of
their
religious
zeal
being
fanned
by
a
belief
that
the
merit
of
their
death
redounds
to
the
good
of
the
whole
community
while
the
praises
which
are
showered
upon
them
in
their
lives
and
the
prospect
of
the
honours
and
worship
which
await
them
after
death
serve
as
additional
incentives
to
suicide
the
beautiful
mountains
of
in
the
district
of
are
or
were
till
lately
the
scene
of
many
such
voluntary
martyrdoms
the
victims
are
monks
who
weary
of
the
vanities
of
earth
have
withdrawn
even
from
their
monasteries
and
spent
years
alone
in
one
or
other
of
the
hermitages
which
are
scattered
among
the
ravines
and
precipices
of
this
wild
and
secluded
region
their
fancy
having
been
wrought
and
their
resolution
strung
to
the
necessary
pitch
by
a
life
of
solitude
and
brooding
contemplation
they
announce
their
intention
and
fix
the
day
of
their
departure
from
this
world
of
shadows
always
choosing
for
that
purpose
a
festival
which
draws
a
crowd
of
worshippers
and
pilgrims
to
one
of
the
many
monasteries
of
the
district
advertisements
of
the
approaching
solemnity
are
posted
throughout
the
country
and
believers
are
invited
to
attend
and
assist
the
martyrs
with
their
prayers
from
three
to
five
monks
are
said
thus
to
commit
themselves
to
the
flames
every
year
at
they
prepare
by
fasting
and
ablution
for
the
last
fiery
trial
of
their
faith
an
upright
chest
containing
a
seat
is
placed
in
a
brick
furnace
and
the
space
between
the
chest
and
the
walls
of
the
furnace
is
filled
with
fuel
the
doomed
man
takes
his
seat
in
the
chest
the
door
is
shut
on
him
and
barred
fire
is
applied
to
the
combustibles
and
consumes
the
candidate
for
heaven
when
all
is
over
the
charred
remains
are
raked
together
worshipped
and
reverently
buried
in
a
dagoba
or
shrine
destined
for
the
preservation
and
worship
of
the
relics
of
saints
the
victims
it
is
said
are
not
always
voluntary
in
remote
districts
unscrupulous
priests
have
been
known
to
stupefy
a
clerical
brother
with
drugs
and
then
burn
him
publicly
an
unwilling
martyr
as
a
means
of
spreading
the
renown
of
the
monastery
and
thereby
attracting
the
alms
of
the
faithful
on
the
of
january
the
monastery
distant
about
a
day
s
journey
from
the
city
of
witnessed
the
voluntary
death
by
fire
of
two
monks
who
bore
the
euphonious
names
of
and
before
they
entered
the
furnaces
the
spectators
prayed
them
to
become
after
death
the
spiritual
guardians
of
the
neighbourhood
to
protect
it
from
all
evil
influences
and
to
grant
luck
in
trade
fine
seasons
plentiful
harvests
and
every
other
blessing
the
martyrs
complaisantly
promised
to
comply
with
these
requests
and
were
thereupon
worshipped
as
living
buddhas
while
a
stream
of
gifts
poured
into
the
coffers
of
the
monastery
among
the
esquimaux
of
bering
strait
a
shaman
has
been
known
to
burn
himself
alive
in
the
expectation
of
returning
to
life
with
much
stronger
powers
than
he
had
possessed
before
but
the
suicides
by
fire
of
chinese
buddhists
and
esquimaux
sorcerers
have
been
far
surpassed
by
the
frenzies
of
christian
fanaticism
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
internal
troubles
of
their
unhappy
country
viewed
in
the
dim
light
of
prophecy
created
a
widespread
belief
among
the
russian
people
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
and
that
the
reign
of
antichrist
was
about
to
begin
we
know
from
scripture
that
the
old
serpent
which
is
the
devil
has
been
or
will
be
shut
up
under
lock
and
key
for
a
thousand
years
and
that
the
number
of
the
beast
is
six
hundred
and
a
simple
mathematical
calculation
based
on
these
irrefragable
data
pointed
to
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
as
the
date
when
the
final
consummation
of
all
things
and
the
arrival
of
the
beast
in
question
might
be
confidently
anticipated
when
the
year
came
and
went
and
still
to
the
general
surprise
the
animal
failed
to
put
in
an
appearance
the
calculations
were
revised
it
was
discovered
that
an
error
had
crept
into
them
and
the
world
was
respited
for
another
years
but
though
opinions
differed
as
to
the
precise
date
of
the
catastrophe
the
pious
were
unanimous
in
their
conviction
of
its
proximity
accordingly
some
of
them
ceased
to
till
their
fields
abandoned
their
houses
and
on
certain
nights
of
the
year
expected
the
sound
of
the
last
trump
in
coffins
which
they
took
the
precaution
of
closing
lest
their
senses
or
what
remained
of
them
should
be
overpowered
by
the
awful
vision
of
the
judgment
day
it
would
have
been
well
if
the
delusion
of
their
disordered
intellects
had
stopped
there
unhappily
in
many
cases
it
went
much
further
and
suicide
universal
suicide
was
preached
by
fervent
missionaries
as
the
only
means
to
escape
the
snares
of
antichrist
and
to
pass
from
the
sins
and
sorrows
of
this
fleeting
world
to
the
eternal
joys
of
heaven
whole
communities
hailed
with
enthusiasm
the
gospel
of
death
and
hastened
to
put
its
precepts
in
practice
an
epidemic
of
suicide
raged
throughout
northern
and
russia
at
first
the
favourite
mode
of
death
was
by
starvation
in
the
forest
of
vetlouga
for
example
an
old
man
founded
an
establishment
for
the
use
of
religious
suicides
it
was
a
building
without
doors
and
windows
the
aspirants
to
heaven
were
lowered
into
it
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
the
hatch
was
battened
down
on
them
and
men
armed
with
clubs
patrolled
the
outer
walls
to
prevent
the
prisoners
from
escaping
hundreds
of
persons
thus
died
a
lingering
death
at
first
the
sounds
of
devotion
issued
from
the
walls
but
as
time
went
on
these
were
replaced
by
entreaties
for
food
prayers
for
mercy
and
finally
imprecations
on
the
miscreant
who
had
lured
these
misguided
beings
to
destruction
and
on
the
parents
who
had
brought
them
into
the
world
to
suffer
such
exquisite
torments
thus
death
by
famine
was
attended
by
some
obvious
disadvantages
it
was
slow
it
opened
the
door
to
repentance
it
occasionally
admitted
of
rescue
accordingly
death
by
fire
was
preferred
as
surer
and
more
expeditious
priests
monks
and
laymen
scoured
the
villages
and
hamlets
preaching
salvation
by
the
flames
some
of
them
decked
in
the
spoils
of
their
victims
for
the
motives
of
the
preachers
were
often
of
the
basest
sort
they
did
not
spare
even
the
children
but
seduced
them
by
promises
of
the
gay
clothes
the
apples
the
nuts
the
honey
they
would
enjoy
in
heaven
sometimes
when
the
people
hesitated
these
infamous
wretches
decided
the
wavering
minds
of
their
dupes
by
a
false
report
that
the
troops
were
coming
to
deliver
them
up
to
antichrist
and
so
to
rob
them
of
a
blissful
eternity
then
men
women
and
children
rushed
into
the
flames
sometimes
hundreds
and
even
thousands
thus
perished
together
an
area
was
enclosed
by
barricades
fuel
was
heaped
up
in
it
the
victims
huddled
together
fire
set
to
the
whole
and
the
sacrifice
consummated
any
who
in
their
agony
sought
to
escape
were
driven
or
thrown
back
into
the
flames
sometimes
by
their
own
relations
these
sinister
fires
generally
blazed
at
night
reddening
the
sky
till
daybreak
in
the
morning
nothing
remained
but
charred
bodies
gnawed
by
prowling
dogs
but
the
stench
of
burnt
human
flesh
poisoned
the
air
for
days
afterwards
as
the
christians
expected
the
arrival
of
antichrist
in
the
year
so
the
jews
cheerfully
anticipated
the
advent
of
their
messiah
in
the
same
fateful
year
a
jew
of
smyrna
by
name
availed
himself
of
this
general
expectation
to
pose
as
the
messiah
in
person
he
was
greeted
with
enthusiasm
jews
from
many
parts
of
europe
hastened
to
pay
their
homage
and
what
was
still
better
their
money
to
the
future
deliverer
of
his
country
who
in
return
parcelled
out
among
them
with
the
greatest
liberality
estates
in
the
holy
land
which
did
not
belong
to
him
but
the
alternative
of
death
by
impalement
or
conversion
to
mohammedanism
which
the
sultan
submitted
to
his
consideration
induced
him
to
revise
his
theological
opinions
and
on
looking
into
the
matter
more
closely
he
discovered
that
his
true
mission
in
life
was
to
preach
the
total
abolition
of
the
jewish
religion
and
the
substitution
for
it
of
islam
kings
killed
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
term
in
the
cases
hitherto
described
the
divine
king
or
priest
is
suffered
by
his
people
to
retain
office
until
some
outward
defect
some
visible
symptom
of
failing
health
or
advancing
age
warns
them
that
he
is
no
longer
equal
to
the
discharge
of
his
divine
duties
but
not
until
such
symptoms
have
made
their
appearance
is
he
put
to
death
some
peoples
however
appear
to
have
thought
it
unsafe
to
wait
for
even
the
slightest
symptom
of
decay
and
have
preferred
to
kill
the
king
while
he
was
still
in
the
full
vigour
of
life
accordingly
they
have
fixed
a
term
beyond
which
he
might
not
reign
and
at
the
close
of
which
he
must
die
the
term
fixed
upon
being
short
enough
to
exclude
the
probability
of
his
degenerating
physically
in
the
interval
in
some
parts
of
southern
india
the
period
fixed
was
twelve
years
thus
according
to
an
old
traveller
in
the
province
of
quilacare
about
twenty
leagues
to
the
of
cape
comorin
there
is
a
gentile
house
of
prayer
in
which
there
is
an
idol
which
they
hold
in
great
account
and
every
twelve
years
they
celebrate
a
great
feast
to
it
whither
all
the
gentiles
go
as
to
a
jubilee
this
temple
possesses
many
lands
and
much
revenue
it
is
a
very
great
affair
this
province
has
a
king
over
it
who
has
not
more
than
twelve
years
to
reign
from
jubilee
to
jubilee
his
manner
of
living
is
in
this
wise
that
is
to
say
when
the
twelve
years
are
completed
on
the
day
of
this
feast
there
assemble
together
innumerable
people
and
much
money
is
spent
in
giving
food
to
bramans
the
king
has
a
wooden
scaffolding
made
spread
over
with
silken
hangings
and
on
that
day
he
goes
to
bathe
at
a
tank
with
great
ceremonies
and
sound
of
music
after
that
he
comes
to
the
idol
and
prays
to
it
and
mounts
on
to
the
scaffolding
and
there
before
all
the
people
he
takes
some
very
sharp
knives
and
begins
to
cut
off
his
nose
and
then
his
ears
and
his
lips
and
all
his
members
and
as
much
flesh
off
himself
as
he
can
and
he
throws
it
away
very
hurriedly
until
so
much
of
his
blood
is
spilled
that
he
begins
to
faint
and
then
he
cuts
his
throat
himself
and
he
performs
this
sacrifice
to
the
idol
and
whoever
desires
to
reign
other
twelve
years
and
undertake
this
martyrdom
for
love
of
the
idol
has
to
be
present
looking
on
at
this
and
from
that
place
they
raise
him
up
as
the
king
of
calicut
on
the
malabar
coast
bears
the
title
of
samorin
or
samory
which
in
the
native
language
is
said
to
mean
god
on
he
pretends
to
be
of
a
higher
rank
than
the
brahmans
and
to
be
inferior
only
to
the
invisible
gods
a
pretention
that
was
acknowledged
by
his
subjects
but
which
is
held
as
absurd
and
abominable
by
the
brahmans
by
whom
he
is
only
treated
as
a
formerly
the
samorin
had
to
cut
his
throat
in
public
at
the
end
of
a
twelve
years
reign
but
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
rule
had
been
modified
as
follows
many
strange
customs
were
observed
in
this
country
in
former
times
and
some
very
odd
ones
are
still
continued
it
was
an
ancient
custom
for
the
samorin
to
reign
but
twelve
years
and
no
longer
if
he
died
before
his
term
was
expired
it
saved
him
a
troublesome
ceremony
of
cutting
his
own
throat
on
a
publick
scaffold
erected
for
the
purpose
he
first
made
a
feast
for
all
his
nobility
and
gentry
who
are
very
numerous
after
the
feast
he
saluted
his
guests
and
went
on
the
scaffold
and
very
decently
cut
his
own
throat
in
the
view
of
the
assembly
and
his
body
was
a
little
while
after
burned
with
great
pomp
and
ceremony
and
the
grandees
elected
a
new
samorin
whether
that
custom
was
a
religious
or
a
civil
ceremony
i
know
not
but
it
is
now
laid
aside
and
a
new
custom
is
followed
by
the
modern
samorins
that
jubilee
is
proclaimed
throughout
his
dominions
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
and
a
tent
is
pitched
for
him
in
a
spacious
plain
and
a
great
feast
is
celebrated
for
ten
or
twelve
days
with
mirth
and
jollity
guns
firing
night
and
day
so
at
the
end
of
the
feast
any
four
of
the
guests
that
have
a
mind
to
gain
a
crown
by
a
desperate
action
in
fighting
their
way
through
or
of
his
guards
and
kill
the
samorin
in
his
tent
he
that
kills
him
succeeds
him
in
his
empire
in
anno
one
of
those
jubilees
happened
and
the
tent
pitched
near
pennany
a
seaport
of
his
about
fifteen
leagues
to
the
southward
of
calicut
there
were
but
three
men
that
would
venture
on
that
desperate
action
who
fell
in
with
sword
and
target
among
the
guard
and
after
they
had
killed
and
wounded
many
were
themselves
killed
one
of
the
desperados
had
a
nephew
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
that
kept
close
by
his
uncle
in
the
attack
on
the
guards
and
when
he
saw
him
fall
the
youth
got
through
the
guards
into
the
tent
and
made
a
stroke
at
his
majesty
s
head
and
had
certainly
despatched
him
if
a
large
brass
lamp
which
was
burning
over
his
head
had
not
marred
the
blow
but
before
he
could
make
another
he
was
killed
by
the
guards
and
i
believe
the
same
samorin
reigns
yet
i
chanced
to
come
that
time
along
the
coast
and
heard
the
guns
for
two
or
three
days
and
nights
the
english
traveller
whose
account
i
have
quoted
did
not
himself
witness
the
festival
he
describes
though
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
firing
in
the
distance
fortunately
exact
records
of
these
festivals
and
of
the
number
of
men
who
perished
at
them
have
been
preserved
in
the
archives
of
the
royal
family
at
calicut
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
were
examined
by
logan
with
the
personal
assistance
of
the
reigning
king
and
from
his
work
it
is
possible
to
gain
an
accurate
conception
both
of
the
tragedy
and
of
the
scene
where
it
was
periodically
enacted
down
to
when
the
ceremony
took
place
for
the
last
time
the
festival
at
which
the
king
of
calicut
staked
his
crown
and
his
life
on
the
issue
of
battle
was
known
as
the
or
great
sacrifice
it
fell
every
twelfth
year
when
the
planet
jupiter
was
in
retrograde
motion
in
the
sign
of
the
crab
and
it
lasted
days
culminating
at
the
time
of
the
eighth
lunar
asterism
in
the
month
of
makaram
as
the
date
of
the
festival
was
determined
by
the
position
of
jupiter
in
the
sky
and
the
interval
between
two
festivals
was
twelve
years
which
is
roughly
jupiter
s
period
of
revolution
round
the
sun
we
may
conjecture
that
the
splendid
planet
was
supposed
to
be
in
a
special
sense
the
king
s
star
and
to
rule
his
destiny
the
period
of
its
revolution
in
heaven
corresponding
to
the
period
of
his
reign
on
earth
however
that
may
be
the
ceremony
was
observed
with
great
pomp
at
the
tirunavayi
temple
on
the
north
bank
of
the
ponnani
river
the
spot
is
close
to
the
present
railway
line
as
the
train
rushes
by
you
can
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
temple
almost
hidden
behind
a
clump
of
trees
on
the
river
bank
from
the
western
gateway
of
the
temple
a
perfectly
straight
road
hardly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
and
shaded
by
a
fine
avenue
runs
for
half
a
mile
to
a
high
ridge
with
a
precipitous
bank
on
which
the
outlines
of
three
or
four
terraces
can
still
be
traced
on
the
topmost
of
these
terraces
the
king
took
his
stand
on
the
eventful
day
the
view
which
it
commands
is
a
fine
one
across
the
flat
expanse
of
the
with
the
broad
placid
river
winding
through
them
the
eye
ranges
eastward
to
high
tablelands
their
lower
slopes
embowered
in
woods
while
afar
off
looms
the
great
chain
of
the
western
ghauts
and
in
the
furthest
distance
the
neilgherries
or
blue
mountains
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
azure
of
the
sky
above
but
it
was
not
to
the
distant
prospect
that
the
king
s
eyes
naturally
turned
at
this
crisis
of
his
fate
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
spectacle
nearer
at
hand
for
all
the
plain
below
was
alive
with
troops
their
banners
waving
gaily
in
the
sun
the
white
tents
of
their
many
camps
standing
sharply
out
against
the
green
and
gold
of
the
forty
thousand
fighting
men
or
more
were
gathered
there
to
defend
the
king
but
if
the
plain
swarmed
with
soldiers
the
road
that
cuts
across
it
from
the
temple
to
the
king
s
stand
was
clear
of
them
not
a
soul
was
stirring
on
it
each
side
of
the
way
was
barred
by
palisades
and
from
the
palisades
on
either
hand
a
long
hedge
of
spears
held
by
strong
arms
projected
into
the
empty
road
their
blades
meeting
in
the
middle
and
forming
a
glittering
arch
of
steel
all
was
now
ready
the
king
waved
his
sword
at
the
same
moment
a
great
chain
of
massy
gold
enriched
with
bosses
was
placed
on
an
elephant
at
his
side
that
was
the
signal
on
the
instant
a
stir
might
be
seen
half
a
mile
away
at
the
gate
of
the
temple
a
group
of
swordsmen
decked
with
flowers
and
smeared
with
ashes
has
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
they
have
just
partaken
of
their
last
meal
on
earth
and
they
now
receive
the
last
blessings
and
farewells
of
their
friends
a
moment
more
and
they
are
coming
down
the
lane
of
spears
hewing
and
stabbing
right
and
left
at
the
spearmen
winding
and
turning
and
writhing
among
the
blades
as
if
they
had
no
bones
in
their
bodies
it
is
all
in
vain
one
after
the
other
they
fall
some
nearer
the
king
some
further
off
content
to
die
not
for
the
shadow
of
a
crown
but
for
the
mere
sake
of
approving
their
dauntless
valour
and
swordsmanship
to
the
world
on
the
last
days
of
the
festival
the
same
magnificent
display
of
gallantry
the
same
useless
sacrifice
of
life
was
repeated
again
and
again
yet
perhaps
no
sacrifice
is
wholly
useless
which
proves
that
there
are
men
who
prefer
honour
to
life
it
is
a
singular
custom
in
bengal
says
an
old
native
historian
of
india
that
there
is
little
of
hereditary
descent
in
succession
to
the
sovereignty
there
is
a
throne
allotted
for
the
king
there
is
in
like
manner
a
seat
or
station
assigned
for
each
of
the
and
it
is
that
throne
and
these
stations
alone
which
engage
the
reverence
of
the
people
of
bengal
a
set
of
dependents
servants
and
attendants
are
annexed
to
each
of
these
situations
when
the
king
wishes
to
dismiss
or
appoint
any
person
whosoever
is
placed
in
the
seat
of
the
one
dismissed
is
immediately
attended
and
obeyed
by
the
whole
establishment
of
dependents
servants
and
retainers
annexed
to
the
seat
which
he
occupies
nay
this
rule
obtains
even
as
to
the
royal
throne
itself
whoever
kills
the
king
and
succeeds
in
placing
himself
on
that
throne
is
immediately
acknowledged
as
king
all
the
soldiers
and
peasants
instantly
obey
and
submit
to
him
and
consider
him
as
being
as
much
their
sovereign
as
they
did
their
former
prince
and
obey
his
orders
implicitly
the
people
of
bengal
say
we
are
faithful
to
the
throne
whoever
fills
the
throne
we
are
obedient
and
true
to
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
formerly
prevailed
in
the
little
kingdom
of
passier
on
the
northern
coast
of
sumatra
the
old
portuguese
historian
de
barros
who
informs
us
of
it
remarks
with
surprise
that
no
wise
man
would
wish
to
be
king
of
passier
since
the
monarch
was
not
allowed
by
his
subjects
to
live
long
from
time
to
time
a
sort
of
fury
seized
the
people
and
they
marched
through
the
streets
of
the
city
chanting
with
loud
voices
the
fatal
words
the
king
must
die
when
the
king
heard
that
song
of
death
he
knew
that
his
hour
had
come
the
man
who
struck
the
fatal
blow
was
of
the
royal
lineage
and
as
soon
as
he
had
done
the
deed
of
blood
and
seated
himself
on
the
throne
he
was
regarded
as
the
legitimate
king
provided
that
he
contrived
to
maintain
his
seat
peaceably
for
a
single
day
this
however
the
regicide
did
not
always
succeed
in
doing
when
fernão
peres
d
andrade
on
a
voyage
to
china
put
in
at
passier
for
a
cargo
of
spices
two
kings
were
massacred
and
that
in
the
most
peaceable
and
orderly
manner
without
the
smallest
sign
of
tumult
or
sedition
in
the
city
where
everything
went
on
in
its
usual
course
as
if
the
murder
or
execution
of
a
king
were
a
matter
of
everyday
occurrence
indeed
on
one
occasion
three
kings
were
raised
to
the
dangerous
elevation
and
followed
each
other
on
the
dusty
road
of
death
in
a
single
day
the
people
defended
the
custom
which
they
esteemed
very
laudable
and
even
of
divine
institution
by
saying
that
god
would
never
allow
so
high
and
mighty
a
being
as
a
king
who
reigned
as
his
vicegerent
on
earth
to
perish
by
violence
unless
for
his
sins
he
thoroughly
deserved
it
far
away
from
the
tropical
island
of
sumatra
a
rule
of
the
same
sort
appears
to
have
obtained
among
the
old
slavs
when
the
captives
gunn
and
jarmerik
contrived
to
slay
the
king
and
queen
of
the
slavs
and
made
their
escape
they
were
pursued
by
the
barbarians
who
shouted
after
them
that
if
they
would
only
come
back
they
would
reign
instead
of
the
murdered
monarch
since
by
a
public
statute
of
the
ancients
the
succession
to
the
throne
fell
to
the
king
s
assassin
but
the
flying
regicides
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
promises
which
they
regarded
as
mere
baits
to
lure
them
back
to
destruction
they
continued
their
flight
and
the
shouts
and
clamour
of
the
barbarians
gradually
died
away
in
the
distance
when
kings
were
bound
to
suffer
death
whether
at
their
own
hands
or
at
the
hands
of
others
on
the
expiration
of
a
fixed
term
of
years
it
was
natural
that
they
should
seek
to
delegate
the
painful
duty
along
with
some
of
the
privileges
of
sovereignty
to
a
substitute
who
should
suffer
vicariously
in
their
stead
this
expedient
appears
to
have
been
resorted
to
by
some
of
the
princes
of
malabar
thus
we
are
informed
by
a
native
authority
on
that
country
that
in
some
places
all
powers
both
executive
and
judicial
were
delegated
for
a
fixed
period
to
natives
by
the
sovereign
this
institution
was
styled
or
authority
obtained
by
decapitation
is
the
name
of
a
supreme
authority
of
those
days
the
name
of
the
office
is
still
preserved
in
the
cochin
state
where
the
village
headman
is
called
a
this
was
a
terrible
but
interesting
institution
it
was
an
office
tenable
for
five
years
during
which
its
bearer
was
invested
with
supreme
despotic
powers
within
his
jurisdiction
on
the
expiry
of
the
five
years
the
man
s
head
was
cut
off
and
thrown
up
in
the
air
amongst
a
large
concourse
of
villagers
each
of
whom
vied
with
the
other
in
trying
to
catch
it
in
its
course
down
he
who
succeeded
was
nominated
to
the
post
for
the
next
five
a
similar
delegation
of
the
duty
of
dying
for
his
country
was
perhaps
practised
by
the
sultans
of
java
at
least
such
a
custom
would
explain
a
strange
scene
which
was
witnessed
at
the
court
of
one
of
these
sultans
by
the
famous
traveller
ibn
batuta
a
native
of
tangier
who
visited
the
east
indies
in
the
first
half
of
the
fourteenth
century
he
says
during
my
audience
with
the
sultan
i
saw
a
man
who
held
in
his
hand
a
knife
like
that
used
by
a
he
placed
it
on
his
own
neck
and
spoke
for
a
long
time
in
a
language
which
i
did
not
understand
after
that
he
seized
the
knife
with
both
hands
at
once
and
cut
his
throat
his
head
fell
to
the
ground
so
sharp
was
the
blade
and
so
great
the
force
with
which
he
used
it
i
remained
dumbfoundered
at
his
behaviour
but
the
sultan
said
to
me
does
any
one
do
like
that
in
your
country
i
answered
never
did
i
see
such
a
he
smiled
and
replied
these
people
are
our
slaves
and
they
kill
themselves
for
love
of
then
he
commanded
that
they
should
take
away
him
who
had
slain
himself
and
should
burn
him
the
sultan
s
officers
the
grandees
the
troops
and
the
common
people
attended
the
cremation
the
sovereign
assigned
a
liberal
pension
to
the
children
of
the
deceased
to
his
wife
and
to
his
brothers
and
they
were
highly
honoured
because
of
his
conduct
a
person
who
was
present
at
the
audience
when
the
event
i
have
described
took
place
informed
me
that
the
speech
made
by
the
man
who
sacrificed
himself
set
forth
his
devotion
to
the
monarch
he
said
that
he
wished
to
immolate
himself
out
of
affection
for
the
sovereign
as
his
father
had
done
for
love
of
the
prince
s
father
and
as
his
grandfather
had
done
out
of
regard
for
the
prince
s
we
may
conjecture
that
formerly
the
sultans
of
java
like
the
kings
of
quilacare
and
calicut
were
bound
to
cut
their
own
throats
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
term
of
years
but
that
at
a
later
time
they
deputed
the
painful
though
glorious
duty
of
dying
for
their
country
to
the
members
of
a
certain
family
who
received
by
way
of
recompense
ample
provision
during
their
life
and
a
handsome
funeral
at
death
a
similar
mode
of
religious
suicide
seems
to
have
been
often
adopted
in
india
especially
in
malabar
during
the
middle
ages
thus
we
are
told
by
friar
jordanus
that
in
the
greater
india
by
which
he
seems
to
mean
malabar
and
the
neighbouring
regions
many
sacrifice
themselves
to
the
idols
when
they
are
sick
or
involved
in
misfortune
they
vow
themselves
to
the
idol
in
case
they
are
delivered
then
when
they
have
recovered
they
fatten
themselves
for
one
or
two
years
and
when
another
festival
comes
round
they
cover
themselves
with
flowers
crown
themselves
with
white
garlands
and
go
singing
and
playing
before
the
idol
when
it
is
carried
through
the
land
there
after
they
have
shown
off
a
great
deal
they
take
a
sword
with
two
handles
like
those
used
in
currying
leather
put
it
to
the
back
of
their
neck
and
cutting
strongly
with
both
hands
sever
their
heads
from
their
bodies
before
the
idol
again
nicolo
conti
who
travelled
in
the
east
in
the
early
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
informs
us
that
in
the
city
of
cambaita
many
present
themselves
who
have
determined
upon
self
immolation
having
on
their
neck
a
broad
circular
piece
of
iron
the
fore
part
of
which
is
round
and
the
hinder
part
extremely
sharp
a
chain
attached
to
the
fore
part
hangs
suspended
upon
the
breast
into
which
the
victims
sitting
down
with
their
legs
drawn
up
and
their
neck
bent
insert
their
feet
then
on
the
speaker
pronouncing
certain
words
they
suddenly
stretch
out
their
legs
and
at
the
same
time
drawing
up
their
neck
cut
off
their
own
head
yielding
up
their
lives
as
a
sacrifice
to
their
idols
these
men
are
regarded
as
among
the
jaintias
or
syntengs
a
khasi
tribe
of
assam
human
sacrifices
used
to
be
annually
offered
on
the
day
in
the
month
of
ashwin
persons
often
came
forward
voluntarily
and
presented
themselves
as
victims
this
they
generally
did
by
appearing
before
the
rajah
on
the
last
day
of
shravan
and
declaring
that
the
goddess
had
called
them
to
herself
after
due
enquiry
if
the
victim
were
found
suitable
it
was
customary
for
the
rajah
to
present
him
with
a
golden
anklet
and
to
give
him
permission
to
live
as
he
chose
and
to
do
what
he
liked
the
royal
treasury
undertaking
to
pay
compensation
for
any
damage
he
might
do
in
the
exercise
of
his
remarkable
privileges
but
the
enjoyment
of
these
privileges
was
very
short
on
the
day
appointed
the
voluntary
victim
after
bathing
and
purifying
himself
was
dressed
in
new
attire
daubed
with
red
and
vermilion
and
bedecked
with
garlands
thus
arrayed
he
sat
for
a
time
in
meditation
and
prayer
on
a
dais
in
front
of
the
goddess
then
he
made
a
sign
with
his
finger
and
the
executioner
after
uttering
the
usual
formulas
cut
off
his
head
which
was
thereafter
laid
before
the
goddess
on
a
golden
plate
the
lungs
were
cooked
and
eaten
by
such
as
were
present
and
it
is
said
that
the
royal
family
partook
of
a
small
quantity
of
rice
cooked
in
the
blood
of
the
victim
the
ceremony
was
usually
witnessed
by
crowds
of
spectators
who
assembled
from
all
parts
of
the
neighbouring
hills
when
the
supply
of
voluntary
victims
fell
short
emissaries
were
sent
out
to
kidnap
strangers
from
other
territories
and
it
was
the
practice
of
such
that
led
to
the
annexation
of
the
jaintia
country
by
the
british
when
once
kings
who
had
hitherto
been
bound
to
die
a
violent
death
at
the
end
of
a
term
of
years
conceived
the
happy
thought
of
dying
by
deputy
in
the
persons
of
others
they
would
very
naturally
put
it
in
practice
and
accordingly
we
need
not
wonder
at
finding
so
popular
an
expedient
or
traces
of
it
in
many
lands
thus
for
example
the
bhuiyas
are
an
aboriginal
race
of
india
and
one
of
their
chief
seats
is
keonjhur
at
the
installation
of
a
rajah
of
keonjhur
a
ceremony
is
observed
which
has
been
described
as
follows
by
an
english
officer
who
witnessed
it
then
the
sword
a
very
rusty
old
weapon
is
placed
in
the
raja
s
hands
and
one
of
the
bhuiyas
named
anand
kopat
comes
before
him
and
kneeling
sideways
the
raja
touches
him
on
the
neck
as
if
about
to
strike
off
his
head
and
it
is
said
that
in
former
days
there
was
no
fiction
in
this
part
of
the
ceremony
the
family
of
the
kopat
hold
their
lands
on
the
condition
that
the
victim
when
required
shall
be
produced
anand
however
hurriedly
arose
after
the
accolade
and
disappeared
he
must
not
be
seen
for
three
days
then
he
presents
himself
again
to
the
raja
as
miraculously
restored
to
here
the
custom
of
putting
the
king
s
proxy
to
death
has
dwindled
probably
under
english
influence
to
a
mere
pretence
but
elsewhere
it
survives
or
survived
till
recent
times
in
full
force
cassange
a
native
state
in
the
interior
of
angola
is
ruled
by
a
king
who
bears
the
title
of
jaga
when
a
king
is
about
to
be
installed
in
office
some
of
the
chiefs
are
despatched
to
find
a
human
victim
who
may
not
be
related
by
blood
or
marriage
to
the
new
monarch
when
he
comes
to
the
king
s
camp
the
victim
is
provided
with
everything
he
requires
and
all
his
orders
are
obeyed
as
promptly
as
those
of
the
sovereign
on
the
day
of
the
ceremony
the
king
takes
his
seat
on
a
perforated
iron
stool
his
chiefs
councillors
and
the
rest
of
the
people
forming
a
great
circle
round
about
him
behind
the
king
sits
his
principal
wife
together
with
all
his
concubines
an
iron
gong
with
two
small
bells
attached
to
it
is
then
struck
by
an
official
who
continues
to
ring
the
bells
during
the
ceremony
the
victim
is
then
introduced
and
placed
in
front
of
the
king
but
with
his
back
towards
him
armed
with
a
scimitar
the
king
then
cuts
open
the
man
s
back
extracts
his
heart
and
having
taken
a
bite
out
of
it
spits
it
out
and
gives
it
to
be
burned
the
councillors
meantime
hold
the
victim
s
body
so
that
the
blood
from
the
wound
spouts
against
the
king
s
breast
and
belly
and
pouring
through
the
hole
in
the
iron
stool
is
collected
by
the
chiefs
in
their
hands
who
rub
their
breasts
and
beards
with
it
while
they
shout
great

the
king
and
the
rites
of
the
state
after
that
the
corpse
is
skinned
cut
up
and
cooked
with
the
flesh
of
an
ox
a
dog
a
hen
and
some
other
animals
the
meal
thus
prepared
is
served
first
to
the
king
then
to
the
chiefs
and
councillors
and
lastly
to
all
the
people
assembled
any
man
who
refused
to
partake
of
it

be
sold
into
slavery
together
with
his
family
the
distinction
with
which
the
human
victim
is
here
treated
before
his
execution
suggests
that
he
is
a
substitute
for
the
king
scandinavian
traditions
contain
some
hints
that
of
old
the
swedish
kings
reigned
only
for
periods
of
nine
years
after
which
they
were
put
to
death
or
had
to
find
a
substitute
to
die
in
their
stead
thus
aun
or
on
king
of
sweden
is
said
to
have
sacrificed
to
odin
for
length
of
days
and
to
have
been
answered
by
the
god
that
he
should
live
so
long
as
he
sacrificed
one
of
his
sons
every
ninth
year
he
sacrificed
nine
of
them
in
this
manner
and
would
have
sacrificed
the
tenth
and
last
but
the
swedes
would
not
allow
him
so
he
died
and
was
buried
in
a
mound
at
upsala
another
indication
of
a
similar
tenure
of
the
crown
occurs
in
a
curious
legend
of
the
disposition
and
banishment
of
odin
offended
at
his
misdeeds
the
other
gods
outlawed
and
exiled
him
but
set
up
in
his
place
a
substitute
oller
by
name
a
cunning
wizard
to
whom
they
accorded
the
symbols
both
of
royalty
and
of
godhead
the
deputy
bore
the
name
of
odin
and
reigned
for
nearly
ten
years
when
he
was
driven
from
the
throne
while
the
real
odin
came
to
his
own
again
his
discomfited
rival
retired
to
sweden
and
was
afterwards
slain
in
an
attempt
to
repair
his
shattered
fortunes
as
gods
are
often
merely
men
who
loom
large
through
the
mists
of
tradition
we
may
conjecture
that
this
norse
legend
preserves
a
confused
reminiscence
of
ancient
swedish
kings
who
reigned
for
nine
or
ten
years
together
then
abdicated
delegating
to
others
the
privilege
of
dying
for
their
country
the
great
festival
which
was
held
at
upsala
every
nine
years
may
have
been
the
occasion
on
which
the
king
or
his
deputy
was
put
to
death
we
know
that
human
sacrifices
formed
part
of
the
rites
octennial
tenure
of
the
kingship
there
are
some
grounds
for
believing
that
the
reign
of
many
ancient
greek
kings
was
limited
to
eight
years
or
at
least
that
at
the
end
of
every
period
of
eight
years
a
new
consecration
a
fresh
outpouring
of
the
divine
grace
was
regarded
as
necessary
in
order
to
enable
them
to
discharge
their
civil
and
religious
duties
thus
it
was
a
rule
of
the
spartan
constitution
that
every
eighth
year
the
ephors
should
choose
a
clear
and
moonless
night
and
sitting
down
observe
the
sky
in
silence
if
during
their
vigil
they
saw
a
meteor
or
shooting
star
they
inferred
that
the
king
had
sinned
against
the
deity
and
they
suspended
him
from
his
functions
until
the
delphic
or
olympic
oracle
should
reinstate
him
in
them
this
custom
which
has
all
the
air
of
great
antiquity
was
not
suffered
to
remain
a
dead
letter
even
in
the
last
period
of
the
spartan
monarchy
for
in
the
third
century
before
our
era
a
king
who
had
rendered
himself
obnoxious
to
the
reforming
party
was
actually
deposed
on
various
charges
among
which
the
allegation
that
the
ominous
sign
had
been
seen
in
the
sky
took
a
prominent
place
when
we
compare
this
custom
with
the
evidence
to
be
presently
adduced
of
an
eight
years
tenure
of
the
kingship
in
greece
we
shall
probably
agree
with
müller
that
the
quaint
spartan
practice
was
much
more
than
a
mere
antiquarian
curiosity
it
was
the
attenuated
survival
of
an
institution
which
may
once
have
had
great
significance
and
it
throws
an
important
light
on
the
restrictions
and
limitations
anciently
imposed
by
religion
on
the
dorian
kingship
what
exactly
was
the
import
of
a
meteor
in
the
opinion
of
the
old
dorians
we
can
hardly
hope
to
determine
one
thing
only
is
clear
they
regarded
it
as
a
portent
of
so
ominous
and
threatening
a
kind
that
its
appearance
under
certain
circumstances
justified
and
even
required
the
deposition
of
their
king
this
exaggerated
dread
of
so
simple
a
natural
phenomenon
is
shared
by
many
savages
at
the
present
day
and
we
shall
hardly
err
in
supposing
that
the
spartans
inherited
it
from
their
barbarous
ancestors
who
may
have
watched
with
consternation
on
many
a
starry
night
among
the
woods
of
germany
the
flashing
of
a
meteor
through
the
sky
it
may
be
well
even
at
the
cost
of
a
digression
to
illustrate
this
primitive
superstition
by
examples
thus
shooting
stars
and
meteors
are
viewed
with
apprehension
by
the
natives
of
the
andaman
islands
who
suppose
them
to
be
lighted
faggots
hurled
into
the
air
by
the
malignant
spirit
of
the
woods
in
order
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
any
unhappy
wight
in
his
vicinity
hence
if
they
happen
to
be
away
from
their
camp
when
the
meteor
is
seen
they
hide
themselves
and
remain
silent
for
a
little
before
they
venture
to
resume
the
work
they
were
at
for
example
if
they
are
out
fishing
they
will
crouch
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
natives
of
the
tully
river
in
queensland
believe
falling
stars
to
be
the
carried
about
by
the
spirits
of
dead
enemies
when
they
see
one
shooting
through
the
air
they
take
it
as
a
sign
that
an
enemy
is
near
and
accordingly
they
shout
and
make
as
much
noise
as
they
can
next
morning
they
all
go
out
in
the
direction
in
which
the
star
fell
and
look
for
the
tracks
of
their
foe
the
turrbal
tribe
of
queensland
thought
that
a
falling
star
was
a
flying
through
the
air
and
dropping
his
to
kill
somebody
if
there
was
a
sick
man
in
the
camp
they
regarded
him
as
doomed
the
ngarigo
of
new
south
wales
believed
the
fall
of
a
meteor
to
betoken
the
place
where
their
foes
were
mustering
for
war
the
kaitish
tribe
of
central
australia
imagine
that
the
fall
of
a
star
marks
the
whereabouts
of
a
man
who
has
killed
another
by
means
of
a
magical
or
bone
if
a
member
of
any
group
has
been
killed
in
this
way
his
friends
watch
for
the
descent
of
a
meteor
march
in
that
direction
slay
an
enemy
there
and
leave
his
body
lying
on
the
ground
the
friends
of
the
murdered
man
understand
what
has
happened
and
bury
his
body
where
the
star
fell
for
they
recognise
the
spot
by
the
softness
of

the
mara
tribe
of
northern
australia
suppose
a
falling
star
to
be
one
of
two
hostile
spirits
father
and
son
who
live
up
in
the
sky
and
come
down
occasionally
to
do
harm
to
men
in
this
tribe
the
profession
of
is
strictly
hereditary
in
the
stock
which
has
the
falling
star
for
its
totem
if
these
wizards
had
ever
developed
into
kings
the
descent
of
a
meteor
at
certain
times
might
have
had
the
same
fatal
significance
for
them
as
for
the
kings
of
sparta
the
taui
islanders
to
the
west
of
the
bismarck
archipelago
make
war
in
the
direction
in
which
they
have
observed
a
star
to
fall
probably
for
a
reason
like
that
which
induces
the
kaitish
to
do
the
same
when
the
baronga
of
south
africa
see
a
shooting
star
they
spit
on
the
ground
to
avert
the
evil
omen
and
cry
go
away
go
away
all
alone
by
this
they
mean
that
the
light
which
is
so
soon
to
disappear
is
not
to
take
them
with
it
but
to
go
and
die
by
itself
so
when
a
masai
perceives
the
flash
of
a
meteor
he
spits
several
times
and
says
be
lost
go
in
the
direction
of

after
which
he
adds
stay
away
from
the
namaquas
are
greatly
afraid
of
the
meteor
which
is
vulgarly
called
a
falling
star
for
they
consider
it
a
sign
that
sickness
is
coming
upon
the
cattle
and
to
escape
it
they
will
immediately
drive
them
to
some
other
parts
of
the
country
they
call
out
to
the
star
how
many
cattle
they
have
and
beg
of
it
not
to
send
the
bechuanas
are
also
much
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
a
meteor
if
they
happen
to
be
dancing
in
the
open
air
at
the
time
they
will
instantly
desist
and
retire
hastily
to
their
huts
the
ewe
negroes
of
guinea
regard
a
falling
star
as
a
powerful
divinity
and
worship
it
as
one
of
their
national
gods
by
the
name
of
nyikpla
or
nyigbla
in
their
opinion
the
falling
star
is
especially
a
who
marches
at
the
head
of
the
host
and
leads
it
to
victory
riding
like
castor
and
pollux
on
horseback
but
he
is
also
a
and
the
showers
are
sent
by
him
from
the
sky
special
priests
are
devoted
to
his
worship
with
a
chief
priest
at
their
head
who
resides
in
the
capital
they
are
known
by
the
red
staves
which
they
carry
and
by
the
caps
woven
of
threads
and
which
they
wear
on
their
heads
in
times
of
drought
they
call
upon
their
god
by
night
with
wild
howls
once
a
year
an
ox
is
sacrificed
to
him
at
the
capital
and
the
priests
consume
the
flesh
on
this
occasion

smear
themselves
with
the

of

some
indians
of
california
meteors
were
called
children
of
the
moon
and
whenever
young
women
saw
one
of
them
they
fell
to
the
ground
and
covered
their
heads
fearing
that
if
the
meteor
saw
them
their
faces
would
become
ugly
and
diseased
the
tarahumares
of
mexico
fancy
that
a
shooting
star
is
a
dead
sorcerer
coming
to
harm
a
man
who
harmed
him
in
life
hence
when
they
see
one
they
huddle
together
and
scream
for
terror
when
a
german
traveller
was
living
with
the
bororos
of
central
brazil
a
splendid
meteor
fell
spreading
dismay
through
the
indian
village
it
was
believed
to
be
the
soul
of
a
dead
who
suddenly
appeared
in
this
form
to
announce
that
he
wanted
meat
and
that
as
a
preliminary
measure
he
proposed
to
visit
somebody
with
an
attack
of
dysentery
its
appearance
was
greeted
with
yells
from
a
hundred
throats
men
women
and
children
swarmed
out
of
their
huts
like
ants
whose
nest
has
been
disturbed
and
soon
blazed
round
which
at
a
little
distance
groups
of
dusky
figures
gathered
while
in
the
middle
thrown
into
strong
relief
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
fire
two
sorcerers
reeled
and
staggered
in
a
state
of
frantic
excitement
snorting
and
spitting
towards
the
quarter
of
the
sky
where
the
meteor
had
run
its
brief
but
brilliant
course
pressing
his
right
hand
to
his
yelling
mouth
each
of
them
held
aloft
in
his
extended
left
by
way
of
propitiating
the
angry
star
a
bundle
of
cigarettes
there
they
seemed
to
say
all
that
tobacco
will
we
give
to
ward
off
the
impending
visitation
woe
to
you
if
you
do
not
leave
us
in
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
also
stand
in
great
fear
of
meteors
imagining
them
to
be
stones
hurled
from
heaven
at
the
wicked
sorcerers
who
have
done
people
to
death
by
their
charms
when
the
abipones
beheld
a
meteor
flashing
or
heard
thunder
rolling
in
the
sky
they
imagined
that
one
of
their
had
died
and
that
the
flash
of
light
and
the
peal
of
thunder
were
part
of
his
funeral
honours
when
the
laughlan
islanders
see
a
shooting
star
they
make
a
great
noise
for
they
think
it
is
the
old
woman
who
lives
in
the
moon
coming
down
to
earth
to
catch
somebody
who
may
relieve
her
of
her
duties
in
the
moon
while
she
goes
away
to
the
happy
in
vedic
india
a
meteor
was
believed
to
be
the
embodiment
of
a
demon
and
on
its
appearance
certain
hymns
or
incantations
supposed
to
possess
the
power
of
killing
demons
were
recited
for
the
purpose
of
expiating
the
prodigy
to
this
day
in
india
when
women
see
a
falling
star
they
spit
thrice
to
scare
the
demon
some
of
the
esthonians
at
the
present
time
regard
shooting
stars
as
evil
spirits
it
is
a
mohammedan
belief
that
falling
stars
are
demons
or
jinn
who
have
attempted
to
scale
the
sky
and
being
repulsed
by
the
angels
with
stones
are
hurled
headlong
flaming
from
the
celestial
vault
hence
every
true
believer
at
sight
of
a
meteor
should
say
i
take
refuge
with
god
from
the
stoned
a
widespread
superstition
of
which
some
examples
have
already
been
given
associates
meteors
or
falling
stars
with
the
souls
of
the
dead
often
they
are
believed
to
be
the
spirits
of
the
departed
on
their
way
to
the
other
world
the
maoris
imagine
that
at
death
the
soul
leaves
the
body
and
goes
to
the
nether
world
in
the
form
of
a
falling
star
the
kingsmill
islanders
deemed
a
shooting
star
an
omen
of
death
to
some
member
of
the
family
which
occupied
the
part
of
the
nearest
to
the
point
of
the
sky
whence
the
meteor
took
its
flight
if
the
star
was
followed
by
a
train
of
light
it
foretold
the
death
of
a
woman
if
not
the
death
of
a
man
when
the
wotjobaluk
tribe
of
victoria
see
a
shooting
star
they
think
it
is
falling
with
the
heart
of
a
man
who
has
been
caught
by
a
sorcerer
and
deprived
of
his
fat
one
evening
when
howitt
was
talking
with
an
australian
black
a
bright
meteor
was
seen
shooting
through
the
sky
the
native
watched
it
and
remarked
an
old
blackfellow
has
fallen
down
among
the
yerrunthally
tribe
of
queensland
the
ideas
on
this
subject
were
even
more
definite
they
thought
that
after
death
they
went
to
a
place
away
among
the
stars
and
that
to
reach
it
they
had
to
climb
up
a
rope
when
they
had
clambered
up
they
let
go
the
rope
which
as
it
fell
from
heaven
appeared
to
people
on
earth
as
a
falling
star
the
natives
of
the
prince
of
wales
islands
off
queensland
are
much
afraid
of
shooting
stars
for
they
believe
them
to
be
ghosts
which
in
breaking
up
produce
young
ones
of
their
own
kind
the
natives
of
the
gazelle
peninsula
in
new
britain
think
that
meteors
are
the
souls
of
people
who
have
been
murdered
or
eaten
so
at
the
sight
of
a
meteor
flashing
they
cry
out
the
ghost
of
a
murdered
man
according
to
the
sulka
of
new
britain
meteors
are
souls
which
have
been
flung
into
the
air
in
order
to
plunge
into
the
sea
and
the
train
of
light
which
they
leave
behind
them
is
a
burning
tail
of
dry
leaves
which
has
been
tied
to
them
by
other
souls
in
order
to
help
them
to
wing
their
way
through
the
air
the
caffres
of
south
africa
often
say
that
a
shooting
star
is
the
sign
of
the
death
of
some
chief
and
at
sight
of
it
they
will
spit
on
the
ground
as
a
mark
of
friendly
feeling
towards
the
dead
man
similarly
the
ababua
of
the
congo
valley
think
that
a
chief
will
die
in
the
village
into
which
a
star
appears
to
fall
unless
the
danger
of
death
be
averted
by
a
particular
dance
in
the
opinion
of
the
masai
the
fall
of
a
meteor
signifies
the
death
of
some
one
at
sight
of
it
they
pray
that
the
victim
may
be
one
of
their
enemies
the
wambugwe
of
eastern
africa
fancy
that
the
stars
are
men
of
whom
one
dies
whenever
a
star
is
seen
to
fall
the
tinneh
indians
and
the
tchiglit
esquimaux
of
america
believe
that
human
life
on
earth
is
influenced
by
the
stars
and
they
take
a
shooting
star
to
be
a
sign
that
some
one
has
died
the
lolos
an
aboriginal
tribe
of
western
china
hold
that
for
each
person
on
earth
there
is
a
corresponding
star
in
the
sky
hence
when
a
man
is
ill
they
sacrifice
wine
to
his
star
and
light
four
and
twenty
lamps
outside
of
his
room
on
the
day
after
the
funeral
they
dig
a
hole
in
the
chamber
of
death
and
pray
the
dead
man
s
star
to
descend
and
be
buried
in
it
if
this
precaution
were
not
taken
the
star
might
fall
and
hit
somebody
and
hurt
him
very
much
in
classical
antiquity
there
was
a
popular
notion
that
every
human
being
had
his
own
star
in
the
sky
which
shone
bright
or
dim
according
to
his
good
or
evil
fortune
and
fell
in
the
form
of
a
meteor
when
he
died
superstitions
of
the
same
sort
are
still
commonly
to
be
met
with
in
europe
thus
in
some
parts
of
germany
they
say
that
at
the
birth
of
a
man
a
new
star
is
set
in
the
sky
and
that
as
it
burns
brilliantly
or
faintly
he
grows
rich
or
poor
finally
when
he
dies
it
drops
from
the
sky
in
the
likeness
of
a
shooting
star
similarly
in
brittany
transylvania
bohemia
the
abruzzi
the
romagna
and
the
esthonian
island
of
oesel
it
is
thought
by
some
that
every
man
has
his
own
particular
star
in
the
sky
and
that
when
it
falls
in
the
shape
of
a
meteor
he
expires
a
like
belief
is
entertained
by
polish
jews
in
styria
they
say
that
when
a
shooting
star
is
seen
a
man
has
just
died
or
a
poor
soul
been
released
from
purgatory
the
esthonians
believe
that
if
any
one
sees
a
falling
star
on
new
year
s
night
he
will
die
or
be
visited
by
a
serious
illness
that
year
in
belgium
and
many
parts
of
france
the
people
suppose
that
a
meteor
is
a
soul
which
has
just
quitted
the
body
sometimes
that
it
is
specially
the
soul
of
an
unbaptized
infant
or
of
some
one
who
has
died
without
absolution
at
sight
of
it
they
say
that
you
should
cross
yourself
and
pray
or
that
if
you
wish
for
something
while
the
star
is
falling
you
will
be
sure
to
get
it
among
the
vosges
mountains
in
the
warm
nights
of
july
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
whole
showers
of
shooting
stars
it
is
generally
agreed
that
these
stars
are
souls
but
some
difference
of
opinion
exists
as
to
whether
they
are
souls
just
taking
leave
of
earth
or
tortured
by
the
fires
of
purgatory
or
on
their
passage
from
purgatory
to
heaven
the
last
and
most
cheering
of
these
views
is
held
by
the
french
peasantry
of
beauce
and
perche
and
by
the
italian
peasantry
of
the
abruzzi
and
charitable
people
pray
for
the
deliverance
of
a
soul
at
the
sight
of
a
falling
star
the
downward
direction
of
its
flight
might
naturally
suggest
a
different
goal
and
accordingly
other
people
have
seen
in
the
transient
flame
of
a
meteor
the
descent
of
a
soul
from
heaven
to
be
born
on
earth
in
the
punjaub
for
example
hindoos
believe
that
the
length
of
a
soul
s
residence
in
the
realms
of
bliss
is
exactly
proportioned
to
the
sums
which
the
man
distributed
in
charity
during
his
life
and
that
when
these
are
exhausted
his
time
in
heaven
is
up
and
down
he
comes
in
polynesia
a
shooting
star
was
held
to
be
the
flight
of
a
spirit
and
to
presage
the
birth
of
a
great
prince
the
mandans
of
north
america
fancied
that
the
stars
were
dead
people
and
that
when
a
woman
was
brought
to
bed
a
star
fell
from
heaven
and
entering
into
her
was
born
as
a
child
on
the
biloch
frontier
of
the
punjaub
each
man
is
held
to
have
his
star
and
he
may
not
journey
in
particular
directions
when
his
star
is
in
certain
positions
if
duty
compels
him
to
travel
in
the
forbidden
direction
he
takes
care
before
setting
out
to
bury
his
star
or
rather
a
figure
of
it
cut
out
of
cloth
so
that
it
may
not
see
what
he
is
doing
which
if
any
of
these
superstitions
moved
the
barbarous
dorians
of
old
to
depose
their
kings
whenever
at
a
certain
season
a
meteor
flamed
in
the
sky
we
can
not
say
perhaps
they
had
a
vague
general
notion
that
its
appearance
signified
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
higher
powers
with
the
state
of
the
commonwealth
and
since
in
primitive
society
the
king
is
commonly
held
responsible
for
all
untoward
events
whatever
their
origin
the
natural
course
was
to
relieve
him
of
duties
which
he
had
proved
himself
incapable
of
discharging
but
it
may
be
that
the
idea
in
the
minds
of
these
rude
barbarians
was
more
definite
possibly
like
some
people
in
europe
at
the
present
day
they
thought
that
every
man
had
his
star
in
the
sky
and
that
he
must
die
when
it
fell
the
king
would
be
no
exception
to
the
rule
and
on
a
certain
night
of
a
certain
year
at
the
end
of
a
cycle
it
might
be
customary
to
watch
the
sky
in
order
to
mark
whether
the
king
s
star
was
still
in
the
ascendant
or
near
its
setting
the
appearance
of
a
meteor
on
such
a
a
star
precipitated
from
the
celestial
prove
for
the
king
not
merely
a
symbol
but
a
sentence
of
death
it
might
be
the
warrant
for
his
execution
if
the
tenure
of
the
regal
office
was
formerly
limited
among
the
spartans
to
eight
years
we
may
naturally
ask
why
was
that
precise
period
selected
as
the
measure
of
a
king
s
reign
the
reason
is
probably
to
be
found
in
those
astronomical
considerations
which
determined
the
early
greek
calendar
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
lunar
with
solar
time
is
one
of
the
standing
puzzles
which
has
taxed
the
ingenuity
of
men
who
are
emerging
from
barbarism
now
an
octennial
cycle
is
the
shortest
period
at
the
end
of
which
sun
and
moon
really
mark
time
together
after
overlapping
so
to
say
throughout
the
whole
of
the
interval
thus
for
example
it
is
only
once
in
every
eight
years
that
the
full
moon
coincides
with
the
longest
or
shortest
day
and
as
this
coincidence
can
be
observed
with
the
aid
of
a
simple
dial
the
observation
is
naturally
one
of
the
first
to
furnish
a
base
for
a
calendar
which
shall
bring
lunar
and
solar
times
into
tolerable
though
not
exact
harmony
but
in
early
days
the
proper
adjustment
of
the
calendar
is
a
matter
of
religious
concern
since
on
it
depends
a
knowledge
of
the
right
seasons
for
propitiating
the
deities
whose
favour
is
indispensable
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
no
wonder
therefore
that
the
king
as
the
chief
priest
of
the
state
or
as
himself
a
god
should
be
liable
to
deposition
or
death
at
the
end
of
an
astronomical
period
when
the
great
luminaries
had
run
their
course
on
high
and
were
about
to
renew
the
heavenly
race
it
might
well
be
thought
that
the
king
should
renew
his
divine
energies
or
prove
them
unabated
under
pain
of
making
room
for
a
more
vigorous
successor
in
southern
india
as
we
have
seen
the
king
s
reign
and
life
terminated
with
the
revolution
of
the
planet
jupiter
round
the
sun
in
greece
on
the
other
hand
the
king
s
fate
seems
to
have
hung
in
the
balance
at
the
end
of
every
eight
years
ready
to
fly
up
and
kick
the
beam
as
soon
as
the
opposite
scale
was
loaded
with
a
falling
star
the
same
train
of
thought
may
explain
an
ancient
greek
custom
which
appears
to
have
required
that
a
homicide
should
be
banished
his
country
and
do
penance
for
a
period
of
eight
or
nine
years
with
the
beginning
of
a
new
cycle
or
great
year
as
it
was
called
it
might
be
thought
that
all
nature
was
regenerate
all
old
scores
wiped
out
according
to
pindar
the
dead
whose
guilt
had
been
purged
away
by
an
abode
of
eight
years
in
the
nether
world
were
born
again
on
earth
in
the
ninth
year
as
glorious
kings
athletes
and
sages
the
doctrine
may
well
be
an
old
popular
belief
rather
than
a
mere
poetical
fancy
if
so
it
would
supply
a
fresh
reason
for
the
banishment
of
a
homicide
during
the
years
that
the
angry
ghost
of
his
victim
might
at
any
moment
issue
from
its
and
pounce
on
him
once
the
perturbed
spirit
had
been
happily
reborn
he
might
be
supposed
to
forgive
if
not
to
forget
the
man
who
had
done
him
an
injury
in
a
former
life
whatever
its
origin
may
have
been
the
cycle
of
eight
years
appears
to
have
coincided
with
the
normal
length
of
the
king
s
reign
in
other
parts
of
greece
besides
sparta
thus
minos
king
of
cnossus
in
crete
whose
great
palace
has
been
unearthed
in
recent
years
is
said
to
have
held
office
for
periods
of
eight
years
together
at
the
end
of
each
period
he
retired
for
a
season
to
the
oracular
cave
on
mount
ida
and
there
communed
with
his
divine
father
zeus
giving
him
an
account
of
his
kingship
in
the
years
that
were
past
and
receiving
from
him
instructions
for
his
guidance
in
those
which
were
to
come
the
tradition
plainly
implies
that
at
the
end
of
every
eight
years
the
king
s
sacred
powers
needed
to
be
renewed
by
intercourse
with
the
godhead
and
that
without
such
a
renewal
he
would
have
forfeited
his
right
to
the
throne
we
may
surmise
that
among
the
solemn
ceremonies
which
marked
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
the
eight
years
cycle
the
sacred
marriage
of
the
king
with
the
queen
played
an
important
part
and
that
in
this
marriage
we
have
the
true
explanation
of
the
strange
legend
of
pasiphae
and
the
bull
it
was
said
that
pasiphae
the
wife
of
king
minos
fell
in
love
with
a
wondrous
white
bull
which
rose
from
the
sea
and
that
in
order
to
gratify
her
unnatural
passion
the
artist
daedalus
constructed
a
hollow
wooden
cow
covered
with
a
cow
s
hide
in
which
the
queen
was
hidden
while
the
bull
mounted
it
the
result
of
their
union
was
the
minotaur
a
monster
with
the
body
of
a
man
and
the
head
of
a
bull
whom
the
king
shut
up
in
the
labyrinth
a
building
full
of
such
winding
and
intricate
passages
that
the
prisoner
might
roam
in
it
for
ever
without
finding
the
way
out
the
legend
appears
to
reflect
a
mythical
marriage
of
the
sun
and
moon
which
was
acted
as
a
solemn
rite
by
the
king
and
queen
of
cnossus
wearing
the
masks
of
a
bull
and
cow
respectively
to
a
pastoral
people
a
bull
is
the
most
natural
type
of
vigorous
reproductive
energy
and
as
such
is
a
fitting
emblem
of
the
sun
islanders
who
like
many
of
the
cretans
see
the
sun
daily
rising
from
the
sea
might
readily
compare
him
to
a
white
bull
issuing
from
the
waves
indeed
we
are
expressly
told
that
the
cretans
called
the
sun
a
bull
similarly
in
ancient
egypt
the
sacred
bull
mnevis
of
heliopolis
the
city
of
the
sun
was
deemed
an
incarnation
of
the
and
for
thousands
of
years
the
kings
of
egypt
delighted
to
be
styled
mighty
bull
many
of
them
inscribed
the
title
on
their
or
cognisance
which
set
forth
their
names
in
their
character
of
descendants
of
horus
the
identification
of
pasiphae
she
who
shines
on
all
with
the
moon
was
made
long
ago
by
pausanias
who
saw
her
image
along
with
that
of
the
sun
in
a
sanctuary
on
that
wild
rocky
coast
of
messenia
where
the
great
range
of
taygetus
descends
seaward
in
a
long
line
of
naked
crags
the
horns
of
the
waxing
or
waning
moon
naturally
suggest
the
resemblance
of
the
luminary
to
a
white
cow
hence
the
ancients
represented
the
goddess
of
the
moon
drawn
by
a
team
of
white
cattle
when
we
remember
that
at
the
court
of
egypt
the
king
and
queen
figured
as
god
and
goddess
in
solemn
masquerades
where
the
parts
of
deities
were
played
by
masked
men
and
women
we
need
have
no
difficulty
in
imagining
that
similar
dramas
may
have
been
performed
at
the
court
of
a
cretan
king
whether
we
suppose
them
to
have
been
imported
from
egypt
or
to
have
had
an
independent
origin
the
stories
of
zeus
and
europa
and
of
minos
and
britomartis
or
dictynna
appear
to
be
only
different
expressions
of
the
same
myth
different
echoes
of
the
same
custom
the
moon
rising
from
the
sea
was
the
fair
maiden
europa
coming
across
the
heaving
billows
from
the
far
eastern
land
of
phoenicia
borne
or
pursued
by
her
suitor
the
solar
bull
the
moon
setting
in
the
western
waves
was
the
coy
britomartis
or
dictynna
who
plunged
into
the
sea
to
escape
the
warm
embrace
of
her
lover
minos
himself
the
sun
the
story
how
the
drowning
maiden
was
drawn
up
in
a
fisherman
s
net
may
well
be
as
some
have
thought
the
explanation
given
by
a
simple
seafaring
folk
of
the
moon
s
reappearance
from
the
sea
in
the
east
after
she
had
sunk
into
it
in
the
west
to
the
mythical
fancy
of
the
ancients
the
moon
was
a
coy
or
a
wanton
maiden
who
either
fled
from
or
pursued
the
sun
every
month
till
the
fugitive
was
overtaken
and
the
lovers
enjoyed
each
other
s
company
at
the
time
when
the
luminaries
are
in
conjunction
namely
in
the
interval
between
the
old
and
the
new
moon
hence
on
the
principles
of
sympathetic
magic
that
interval
was
considered
the
time
most
favourable
for
human
marriages
when
the
sun
and
moon
are
wedded
in
the
sky
men
and
women
should
be
wedded
on
earth
and
for
the
same
reason
the
ancients
chose
the
interlunar
day
for
the
celebration
of
the
sacred
marriages
of
gods
and
goddesses
similar
beliefs
and
customs
based
on
them
have
been
noted
among
other
peoples
it
is
likely
therefore
that
a
king
and
queen
who
represented
the
sun
and
moon
may
have
been
expected
to
exercise
their
conjugal
rights
above
all
at
the
time
when
the
moon
was
thought
to
rest
in
the
arms
of
the
sun
however
that
may
have
been
it
would
be
natural
that
their
union
should
be
consummated
with
unusual
solemnity
every
eight
years
when
the
two
great
luminaries
so
to
say
meet
and
mark
time
together
once
more
after
diverging
from
each
other
more
or
less
throughout
the
interval
it
is
true
that
sun
and
moon
are
in
conjunction
once
every
month
but
every
month
their
conjunction
takes
place
at
a
different
point
in
the
sky
until
eight
revolving
years
have
brought
them
together
again
in
the
same
heavenly
bridal
chamber
where
first
they
met
without
being
unduly
rash
we
may
surmise
that
the
tribute
of
seven
youths
and
seven
maidens
whom
the
athenians
were
bound
to
send
to
minos
every
eight
years
had
some
connexion
with
the
renewal
of
the
king
s
power
for
another
octennial
cycle
traditions
varied
as
to
the
fate
which
awaited
the
lads
and
damsels
on
their
arrival
in
crete
but
the
common
view
appears
to
have
been
that
they
were
shut
up
in
the
labyrinth
there
to
be
devoured
by
the
minotaur
or
at
least
to
be
imprisoned
for
life
perhaps
they
were
sacrificed
by
being
roasted
alive
in
a
bronze
image
of
a
bull
or
of
a
man
in
order
to
renew
the
strength
of
the
king
and
of
the
sun
whom
he
personated
this
at
all
events
is
suggested
by
the
legend
of
talos
a
bronze
man
who
clutched
people
to
his
breast
and
leaped
with
them
into
the
fire
so
that
they
were
roasted
alive
he
is
said
to
have
been
given
by
zeus
to
europa
or
by
hephaestus
to
minos
to
guard
the
island
of
crete
which
he
patrolled
thrice
daily
according
to
one
account
he
was
a
bull
according
to
another
he
was
the
sun
probably
he
was
identical
with
the
minotaur
and
stripped
of
his
mythical
features
was
nothing
but
a
bronze
image
of
the
sun
represented
as
a
man
with
a
bull
s
head
in
order
to
renew
the
solar
fires
human
victims
may
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
idol
by
being
roasted
in
its
hollow
body
or
placed
on
its
sloping
hands
and
allowed
to
roll
into
a
pit
of
fire
it
was
in
the
latter
fashion
that
the
carthaginians
sacrificed
their
offspring
to
moloch
the
children
were
laid
on
the
hands
of
a
image
of
bronze
from
which
they
slid
into
a
fiery
oven
while
the
people
danced
to
the
music
of
flutes
and
timbrels
to
drown
the
shrieks
of
the
burning
victims
the
resemblance
which
the
cretan
traditions
bear
to
the
carthaginian
practice
suggests
that
the
worship
associated
with
the
names
of
minos
and
the
minotaur
may
have
been
powerfully
influenced
by
that
of
a
semitic
baal
in
the
tradition
of
phalaris
tyrant
of
agrigentum
and
his
brazen
bull
we
may
have
an
echo
of
similar
rites
in
sicily
where
the
carthaginian
power
struck
deep
roots
but
perhaps
the
youths
and
maidens
who
were
sent
across
the
sea
to
cnossus
had
to
perform
certain
religious
duties
before
they
were
cast
into
the
fiery
furnace
the
same
cunning
artist
daedalus
who
planned
the
labyrinth
and
contrived
the
wooden
cow
for
pasiphae
was
said
to
have
made
a
dance
for
ariadne
daughter
of
minos
it
represented
youths
and
maidens
dancing
in
ranks
the
youths
armed
with
golden
swords
the
maidens
crowned
with
garlands
moreover
when
theseus
landed
with
ariadne
in
delos
on
his
return
from
crete
he
and
the
young
companions
whom
he
had
rescued
from
the
minotaur
are
said
to
have
danced
a
mazy
dance
in
imitation
of
the
intricate
windings
of
the
labyrinth
on
account
of
its
sinuous
turns
the
dance
was
called
the
taken
together
these
two
traditions
suggest
that
the
youths
and
maidens
who
were
sent
to
cnossus
had
to
dance
in
the
labyrinth
before
they
were
sacrificed
to
the
image
at
all
events
there
are
good
grounds
for
thinking
that
there
was
a
famous
dance
which
the
ancients
regularly
associated
with
the
cretan
labyrinth
among
the
romans
that
dance
appears
to
have
been
known
from
the
earliest
times
by
the
name
of
troy
or
the
game
of
troy
tradition
ran
that
it
was
imported
into
italy
by
aeneas
who
transmitted
it
through
his
son
ascanius
to
the
alban
kings
who
in
their
turn
handed
it
down
to
the
romans
it
was
performed
by
bands
of
armed
youths
on
horseback
virgil
compares
their
complicated
evolutions
to
the
windings
of
the
cretan
labyrinth
and
that
the
comparison
is
more
than
a
mere
poetical
flourish
appears
from
a
drawing
on
a
very
ancient
etruscan
vase
found
at
tragliatella
the
drawing
represents
a
procession
of
seven
beardless
warriors
dancing
accompanied
by
two
armed
riders
on
horseback
who
are
also
beardless
an
inscription
proves
that
the
scene
depicted
is
the
game
of
troy
and
attached
to
the
procession
is
a
figure
of
the
cretan
labyrinth
the
pattern
of
which
is
well
known
from
coins
of
cnossus
on
which
it
is
often
represented
the
same
pattern
identified
by
an
inscription
hic
habitat
is
scratched
on
a
wall
at
pompeii
and
it
is
also
worked
in
mosaic
on
the
floor
of
roman
apartments
with
the
figures
of
theseus
and
the
minotaur
in
the
middle
roman
boys
appear
to
have
drawn
the
very
same
pattern
on
the
ground
and
to
have
played
a
game
on
it
probably
a
miniature
game
of
troy
labyrinths
of
similar
type
occur
as
decorations
on
the
floors
of
old
churches
where
they
are
known
as
the
road
of
jerusalem
they
were
used
for
processions
the
garden
mazes
of
the
renaissance
were
modelled
on
them
moreover
they
are
found
very
commonly
in
the
north
of
europe
marked
out
either
by
raised
bands
of
turf
or
by
rows
of
stones
such
labyrinths
may
be
seen
in
norway
sweden
denmark
finnland
the
south
coast
of
russian
lappland
and
even
in
iceland
they
go
by
various
names
such
as
babylon
wieland
s
house
trojeborg
tröburg
and
so
forth
some
of
which
clearly
indicate
their
connexion
with
the
ancient
game
of
troy
they
are
used
for
children
s
games
a
dance
or
game
which
has
thus
spread
over
europe
and
survived
in
a
fashion
to
modern
times
must
have
been
very
popular
and
bearing
in
mind
how
often
with
the
decay
of
old
faiths
the
serious
rites
and
pageants
of
grown
people
have
degenerated
into
the
sports
of
children
we
may
reasonably
ask
whether
ariadne
s
dance
or
the
game
of
troy
may
not
have
had
its
origin
in
religious
ritual
the
ancients
connected
it
with
cnossus
and
the
minotaur
now
we
have
seen
reason
to
hold
with
many
other
scholars
that
cnossus
was
the
seat
of
a
great
worship
of
the
sun
and
that
the
minotaur
was
a
representative
or
embodiment
of
the
may
not
then
ariadne
s
dance
have
been
an
imitation
of
the
sun
s
course
in
the
sky
and
may
not
its
intention
have
been
by
means
of
sympathetic
magic
to
aid
the
great
luminary
to
run
his
race
on
high
we
have
seen
that
during
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
the
chilcotin
indians
walk
in
a
circle
leaning
on
staves
apparently
to
assist
the
labouring
orb
in
egypt
also
the
king
who
embodied
the
seems
to
have
solemnly
walked
round
the
walls
of
a
temple
for
the
sake
of
helping
the
sun
on
his
way
if
there
is
any
truth
in
this
conjecture
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
the
sinuous
lines
of
the
labyrinth
which
the
dancers
followed
in
their
evolutions
may
have
represented
the
ecliptic
the
sun
s
apparent
annual
path
in
the
sky
it
is
some
confirmation
of
this
view
that
on
coins
of
cnossus
the
sun
or
a
star
appears
in
the
middle
of
the
labyrinth
the
place
which
on
other
coins
is
occupied
by
the
minotaur
on
the
whole
the
foregoing
evidence
slight
and
fragmentary
as
it
is
points
to
the
conclusion
that
at
cnossus
the
king
represented
the
and
that
every
eight
years
his
divine
powers
were
renewed
at
a
great
festival
which
comprised
first
the
sacrifice
of
human
victims
by
fire
to
a
image
of
the
sun
and
second
the
marriage
of
the
king
disguised
as
a
bull
to
the
queen
disguised
as
a
cow
the
two
personating
respectively
the
sun
and
the
moon
whatever
may
be
thought
of
these
speculations
we
know
that
many
solemn
rites
were
celebrated
by
the
ancient
greeks
at
intervals
of
eight
years
amongst
them
two
deserve
to
be
noticed
here
because
it
has
been
recently
suggested
with
some
appearance
of
probability
that
they
were
based
on
an
octennial
tenure
of
the
kingship
one
was
the
festival
of
the
crowning
at
delphi
the
other
was
the
festival
of
the
at
thebes
in
their
general
features
the
two
festivals
seem
to
have
resembled
each
other
very
closely
both
represented
dramatically
the
slaying
of
a
great
by
a
god
or
hero
in
both
the
lad
who
played
the
part
of
the
victorious
god
or
hero
crowned
his
brows
with
a
wreath
of
sacred
laurel
and
had
to
submit
to
a
penance
and
purification
for
the
slaughter
of
the
beast
at
delphi
the
legendary
slayer
of
the
dragon
was
apollo
at
thebes
he
was
cadmus
at
both
places
the
legendary
penance
for
the
slaughter
seems
to
have
been
servitude
for
eight
years
the
evidence
for
the
rites
of
the
delphic
festival
is
fairly
complete
but
for
the
theban
festival
it
has
to
be
eked
out
by
which
represent
cadmus
crowned
with
laurel
preparing
to
attack
the
dragon
or
actually
in
combat
with
the
monster
while
goddesses
bend
over
the
champion
holding
out
wreaths
of
laurel
to
him
as
the
mede
of
victory
it
is
true
that
in
historical
times
apollo
appears
to
have
ousted
cadmus
from
the
festival
though
not
from
the
myth
but
at
thebes
the
god
was
plainly
a
late
intruder
for
his
temple
lay
outside
the
walls
whereas
the
most
ancient
sanctuaries
stood
in
the
oldest
part
of
the
city
the
low
hill
which
took
its
name
of
cadmea
from
the
genuine
theban
hero
cadmus
it
is
not
impossible
that
at
delphi
also
and
perhaps
at
other
places
where
the
same
drama
was
acted
apollo
may
have
displaced
an
old
local
hero
in
the
honourable
office
of
both
at
thebes
and
at
delphi
the
dragon
guarded
a
spring
the
water
of
which
was
probably
deemed
oracular
at
delphi
the
sacred
spring
may
have
been
either
cassotis
or
the
more
famed
castaly
which
issues
from
a
narrow
gorge
shut
in
by
rocky
walls
of
tremendous
height
a
little
to
the
east
of
apollo
s
temple
the
waters
of
both
were
thought
to
be
endowed
with
prophetic
power
probably
too
the
monster
was
supposed
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
the
sacred
laurel
from
which
the
victor
in
the
combat
wreathed
his
brows
for
in
the
theban
dragon
appears
coiled
beside
the
holy
tree
and
euripides
describes
the
delphic
dragon
as
covered
by
a
leafy
laurel
at
all
oracular
seats
of
apollo
his
priestess
drank
of
the
sacred
spring
and
chewed
the
sacred
laurel
before
she
prophesied
thus
it
would
seem
that
the
dragon
which
at
delphi
is
expressly
said
to
have
been
the
guardian
of
the
oracle
had
in
its
custody
both
the
instruments
of
divination
the
holy
tree
and
the
holy
water
we
are
reminded
of
the
dragon
or
serpent
slain
by
hercules
which
guarded
the
golden
apples
of
the
hesperides
in
the
happy
garden
but
at
delphi
the
oldest
sacred
tree
appears
as
a
cook
has
pointed
out
to
have
been
not
a
laurel
but
an
oak
for
we
are
told
that
originally
the
victors
in
the
pythian
games
at
delphi
wore
crowns
of
oak
leaves
since
the
laurel
had
not
yet
been
created
now
like
the
festival
of
crowning
the
pythian
games
were
instituted
to
commemorate
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
like
it
they
were
originally
held
every
eighth
year
the
two
festivals
were
celebrated
nearly
at
the
same
time
of
the
year
and
the
representative
of
apollo
in
the
one
and
the
victors
in
the
other
were
adorned
with
crowns
made
from
the
same
sacred
laurel
in
short
the
two
festivals
appear
to
have
been
in
origin
substantially
identical
the
distinction
between
them
may
have
arisen
when
the
delphians
decided
to
hold
the
pythian
games
every
fourth
instead
of
every
eighth
year
we
may
fairly
suppose
therefore
that
the
victors
in
the
pythian
games
like
the
boy
in
the
festival
of
crowning
formerly
acted
the
part
of
the
god
himself
but
if
in
the
beginning
these
actors
in
the
sacred
drama
wore
wreaths
of
oak
instead
of
laurel
it
seems
to
follow
that
the
deity
whom
they
personated
was
the
zeus
rather
than
the
apollo
from
which
again
we
may
infer
that
delphi
was
a
sanctuary
of
zeus
and
the
oak
before
it
became
the
shrine
of
apollo
and
the
laurel
but
why
should
the
crown
of
oak
have
ceased
to
be
the
badge
of
victory
and
why
should
a
wreath
of
laurel
have
taken
its
place
the
abandonment
of
the
oak
crown
may
have
been
a
consequence
of
the
disappearance
of
the
oak
itself
from
the
neighbourhood
of
delphi
in
greece
as
in
italy
the
deciduous
trees
have
for
centuries
been
retreating
up
the
mountain
sides
before
the
advance
of
the
evergreens
when
the
last
venerable
oak
the
rustling
of
whose
leaves
in
the
breeze
had
long
been
listened
to
as
oracular
finally
succumbed
through
age
or
was
laid
low
by
a
storm
the
priests
may
have
cast
about
for
a
tree
of
another
sort
to
take
its
place
yet
they
sought
it
neither
in
the
lower
woods
of
the
valley
nor
in
the
dark
forests
which
clothe
the
upper
slopes
of
parnassus
above
the
frowning
cliffs
of
delphi
legend
ran
that
after
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
apollo
had
purged
himself
from
the
stain
of
blood
in
the
romantic
vale
of
tempe
where
the
peneus
flows
smoothly
in
a
narrow
defile
between
the
lofty
wooded
steeps
of
olympus
and
ossa
here
the
god
crowned
himself
with
a
laurel
wreath
and
thither
accordingly
at
the
festival
of
crowning
his
human
representative
went
to
pluck
the
laurel
for
his
brows
the
custom
though
doubtless
ancient
can
hardly
have
been
original
we
must
suppose
that
in
the
beginning
the
tree
whether
an
oak
or
a
laurel
grew
at
delphi
itself
but
why
should
the
laurel
be
chosen
as
a
substitute
for
the
oak
a
cook
has
suggested
a
plausible
answer
the
laurel
leaf
resembles
so
closely
the
leaf
of
the
ilex
or
in
both
shape
and
colour
that
an
untrained
observer
may
easily
confuse
the
two
the
upper
surface
of
both
is
a
dark
glossy
green
the
lower
surface
shews
a
lighter
tint
nothing
therefore
could
be
more
natural
than
to
make
the
new
wreath
out
of
leaves
which
looked
so
like
the
old
oak
leaves
that
the
substitution
might
almost
pass
undetected
whether
at
thebes
as
at
delphi
the
laurel
had
ousted
the
oak
from
the
place
of
honour
at
the
festival
of
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
we
can
not
say
the
oak
has
long
disappeared
from
the
low
hills
and
flat
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
thebes
but
as
late
as
the
second
century
of
our
era
there
was
a
forest
of
ancient
oaks
not
many
miles
off
at
the
foot
of
mount
cithaeron
it
has
been
conjectured
that
in
ancient
days
the
persons
who
wore
the
wreath
of
laurel
or
oak
at
the
octennial
festivals
of
delphi
and
thebes
were
no
other
than
the
priestly
kings
who
personated
the
god
slew
their
predecessors
in
the
guise
of
dragons
and
reigned
for
a
time
in
their
stead
the
theory
certainly
can
not
be
demonstrated
but
there
is
a
good
deal
of
analogy
in
its
favour
an
eight
years
tenure
of
the
kingship
at
delphi
and
thebes
would
accord
with
the
similar
tenure
of
the
office
at
sparta
and
cnossus
and
if
the
kings
of
cnossus
disguised
themselves
as
bulls
there
seems
no
reason
why
the
kings
of
delphi
and
thebes
should
not
have
personated
dragons
or
serpents
in
all
these
cases
the
animal
whose
guise
the
king
assumed
would
be
sacred
to
the
royal
family
at
first
the
relation
of
the
beast
to
the
man
would
be
direct
and
simple
the
creature
would
be
revered
for
some
such
reason
as
that
for
which
a
savage
respects
a
certain
species
of
animals
for
example
because
he
believes
that
his
ancestors
were
beasts
of
the
same
sort
or
that
the
souls
of
his
dead
are
lodged
in
them
in
later
times
the
sanctity
of
the
species
would
be
explained
by
saying
that
a
god
had
at
some
time
and
for
some
reason
or
other
assumed
the
form
of
the
animal
it
is
probably
not
without
significance
that
in
greek
mythology
the
gods
in
general
and
zeus
in
particular
are
commonly
said
to
have
submitted
to
this
change
of
shape
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
a
love
adventure
such
stories
may
well
reflect
a
custom
of
a
sacred
marriage
at
which
the
actors
played
the
parts
of
the
worshipful
animals
with
the
growth
of
culture
these
local
worships
the
relics
of
a
barbarous
age
would
be
explained
away
by
tales
of
the
loves
of
the
gods
and
gradually
falling
out
of
practice
would
survive
only
as
myths
it
is
said
that
at
the
festival
of
the
zeus
held
every
nine
years
on
the
in
arcadia
a
man
tasted
of
the
bowel
of
a
human
victim
mixed
with
the
bowels
of
animals
and
having
tasted
it
he
was
turned
into
a
wolf
and
remained
a
wolf
for
nine
years
when
he
changed
back
again
into
a
man
if
in
the
interval
he
had
abstained
from
eating
human
flesh
the
tradition
points
to
the
existence
of
a
society
of
cannibal
one
or
more
of
whom
personated
and
were
supposed
to
embody
the
sacred
animal
for
periods
of
nine
years
together
their
theory
and
practice
would
seem
to
have
agreed
with
those
of
the
human
leopard
societies
of
western
africa
whose
members
disguise
themselves
in
the
skins
of
leopards
with
sharp
claws
of
steel
in
that
guise
they
attack
and
kill
men
in
order
to
eat
their
flesh
or
to
extract
powerful
charms
from
their
bodies
their
mode
of
gaining
recruits
is
like
that
of
the
greek
wolf
society
when
a
visitor
came
to
a
village
inhabited
by
a
leopard
society
he
was
invited
to
partake
of
food
in
which
was
mixed
a
small
quantity
of
human
flesh
the
guest
all
unsuspectingly
partook
of
the
repast
and
was
afterwards
told
that
human
flesh
formed
one
of
the
ingredients
of
the
meal
and
that
it
was
then
necessary
that
he
should
join
the
society
which
was
invariably
as
the
ancient
greeks
thought
that
a
man
might
be
turned
into
a
wolf
so
these
negroes
believe
that
he
can
be
changed
into
a
leopard
and
like
the
greeks
some
of
them
fancy
that
if
the
transformed
man
abstains
during
his
transformation
from
preying
on
his
fellows
he
can
regain
his
human
shape
but
that
if
he
once
laps
human
blood
he
must
remain
a
leopard
for
ever
the
hypothesis
that
the
ancient
kings
of
thebes
and
delphi
had
for
their
sacred
animal
the
serpent
or
dragon
and
claimed
kinship
with
the
creature
derives
some
countenance
from
the
tradition
that
at
the
end
of
their
lives
cadmus
and
his
wife
harmonia
quitted
thebes
and
went
to
reign
over
a
tribe
of
encheleans
or
in
illyria
where
they
were
both
finally
transformed
into
dragons
or
serpents
to
the
primitive
mind
an
eel
is
a
it
can
hardly
therefore
be
an
accident
that
the
afterwards
reigned
over
a
tribe
of
and
himself
became
a
serpent
at
last
moreover
according
to
one
account
his
wife
harmonia
was
a
daughter
of
the
very
dragon
which
he
slew
the
tradition
would
fit
in
well
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
dragon
or
serpent
was
the
sacred
animal
of
the
old
royal
house
of
thebes
and
that
the
kingdom
fell
to
him
who
slew
his
predecessor
and
married
his
daughter
we
have
seen
reason
to
think
that
such
a
mode
of
succession
to
the
throne
was
common
in
antiquity
the
story
of
the
final
transformation
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
into
snakes
may
be
a
relic
of
a
belief
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
kings
and
queens
of
thebes
transmigrated
into
the
bodies
of
serpents
just
as
caffre
kings
turn
at
death
into
or
deadly
black
snakes
indeed
the
notion
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
lodge
in
serpents
is
widely
spread
in
africa
and
madagascar
other
african
tribes
believe
that
their
dead
kings
and
chiefs
turn
into
lions
leopards
hyaenas
pythons
hippopotamuses
or
other
creatures
and
the
animals
are
respected
and
spared
accordingly
in
like
manner
the
semang
and
other
wild
tribes
of
the
malay
peninsula
imagine
that
the
souls
of
their
chiefs
priests
and
magicians
transmigrate
at
death
into
the
bodies
of
certain
wild
beasts
such
as
elephants
tigers
and
rhinoceroses
and
that
in
their
bestial
form
the
dead
men
extend
a
benign
protection
to
their
living
human
kinsfolk
even
during
their
lifetime
kings
in
rude
society
sometimes
claim
kinship
with
the
most
formidable
beasts
of
the
country
thus
the
royal
family
of
dahomey
specially
worships
the
leopard
some
of
the
king
s
wives
are
distinguished
by
the
title
of
leopard
wives
and
on
state
occasions
they
wear
striped
cloths
to
resemble
the
animal
one
king
of
dahomey
on
whom
the
french
made
war
bore
the
name
of
shark
hence
in
art
he
was
represented
sometimes
with
a
shark
s
body
and
a
human
head
sometimes
with
a
human
body
and
the
head
of
a
shark
the
trocadero
museum
at
paris
contains
the
wooden
images
of
three
kings
of
dahomey
who
reigned
during
the
nineteenth
century
and
who
are
all
represented
partly
in
human
and
partly
in
animal
form
one
of
them
guezo
bore
the
surname
of
the
cock
and
his
image
represents
him
as
a
man
covered
with
feathers
his
son
guelelé
who
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
was
surnamed
the
lion
and
his
effigy
is
that
of
a
lion
rampant
with
tail
raised
and
hair
on
his
body
but
with
human
feet
and
hands
guelelé
was
succeeded
on
the
throne
by
his
son
behanzin
who
was
surnamed
the
shark
and
his
effigy
portrays
him
standing
upright
with
the
head
and
body
of
a
fish
the
fins
and
scales
being
carefully
represented
while
his
arms
and
legs
are
those
of
a
man
again
a
king
of
benin
was
called
panther
and
a
bronze
statue
of
him
now
in
the
anthropological
museum
at
berlin
represents
him
with
a
panther
s
whiskers
such
portraits
furnish
an
exact
parallel
to
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
true
story
of
the
minotaur
on
the
gold
coast
of
africa
a
powerful
ruler
is
commonly
addressed
as
o
elephant
or
o
lion
and
one
of
the
titles
of
the
king
of
ashantee
mentioned
at
great
ceremonies
is
the
name
of
a
venomous
snake
it
has
been
argued
that
king
david
belonged
to
a
serpent
family
and
that
the
brazen
serpent
which
down
to
the
time
of
hezekiah
was
worshipped
with
fumes
of
burning
incense
represented
the
old
sacred
animal
of
his
house
in
europe
the
bull
the
serpent
and
the
wolf
would
naturally
be
on
the
list
of
royal
beasts
if
the
king
s
soul
was
believed
to
pass
at
death
into
the
sacred
animal
a
custom
might
arise
of
keeping
live
creatures
of
the
species
in
captivity
and
revering
them
as
the
souls
of
dead
rulers
this
would
explain
the
athenian
practice
of
keeping
a
sacred
serpent
on
the
acropolis
and
feeding
it
with
honey
cakes
for
the
serpent
was
identified
with
erichthonius
or
erechtheus
one
of
the
ancient
kings
of
athens
of
whose
palace
some
vestiges
have
been
discovered
in
recent
times
the
creature
was
supposed
to
guard
the
citadel
during
the
persian
invasion
a
report
that
the
serpent
had
left
its
untasted
was
one
of
the
strongest
reasons
which
induced
the
people
to
abandon
athens
to
the
enemy
they
thought
that
the
holy
reptile
had
forsaken
the
city
again
cecrops
the
first
king
of
athens
is
said
to
have
been
and
in
art
he
is
represented
as
a
man
from
the
waist
upwards
while
the
lower
part
of
his
body
consists
of
the
coils
of
a
serpent
it
has
been
suggested
that
like
erechtheus
he
was
identical
with
the
serpent
on
the
acropolis
once
more
we
are
told
that
cychreus
gained
the
kingdom
of
salamis
by
slaying
a
snake
which
ravaged
the
island
but
that
after
his
death
he
like
cadmus
appeared
in
the
form
of
the
reptile
some
said
that
he
was
a
man
who
received
the
name
of
snake
on
account
of
his
cruelty
such
tales
may
preserve
reminiscences
of
kings
who
assumed
the
style
of
serpents
in
their
lifetime
and
were
believed
to
transmigrate
into
serpents
after
death
like
the
dragons
of
thebes
and
delphi
the
athenian
serpent
appears
to
have
been
conceived
as
a
creature
of
the
waters
for
the
erechtheus
was
identified
with
the
poseidon
and
in
his
temple
the
erechtheum
where
the
serpent
lived
there
was
a
tank
which
went
by
the
name
of
the
sea
of
if
the
explanation
of
the
eight
years
cycle
which
i
have
adopted
holds
good
for
thebes
and
delphi
the
octennial
festivals
held
at
these
places
probably
had
some
reference
to
the
sun
and
moon
and
may
have
comprised
a
sacred
marriage
of
these
luminaries
the
solar
character
of
apollo
whether
original
or
adventitious
lends
some
countenance
to
this
view
but
at
both
delphi
and
thebes
the
god
was
apparently
an
intruder
who
usurped
the
place
of
an
older
god
or
hero
at
the
festival
at
thebes
that
older
hero
was
cadmus
now
cadmus
was
a
brother
of
europa
who
appears
to
have
been
a
personification
of
the
moon
conceived
in
the
form
of
a
cow
he
travelled
westward
seeking
his
lost
sister
till
he
came
to
delphi
where
the
oracle
bade
him
give
up
the
search
and
follow
a
cow
which
had
the
white
mark
of
the
full
moon
on
its
flank
wherever
the
cow
fell
down
exhausted
there
he
was
to
take
up
his
abode
and
found
a
city
following
the
cow
and
the
directions
of
the
oracle
he
built
thebes
have
we
not
here
in
another
form
the
myth
of
the
moon
pursued
and
at
last
overtaken
by
the
sun
and
the
famous
wedding
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
to
attend
which
all
the
gods
came
down
from
heaven
may
it
not
have
been
at
once
the
mythical
marriage
of
the
great
luminaries
and
the
ritual
marriage
of
the
king
and
queen
of
thebes
masquerading
like
the
king
and
queen
of
cnossus
in
the
character
of
the
lights
of
heaven
at
the
octennial
festival
which
celebrated
and
symbolised
the
conjunction
of
the
sun
and
moon
after
their
long
separation
their
harmony
after
eight
years
of
discord
a
better
name
for
the
bride
at
such
a
wedding
could
hardly
have
been
chosen
than
harmonia
this
theory
is
supported
by
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
festival
at
the
head
of
the
procession
immediately
in
front
of
the
walked
a
youth
who
carried
in
his
hands
a
staff
of
draped
with
laurels
and
flowers
to
the
top
of
the
staff
was
fastened
a
bronze
globe
with
smaller
globes
hung
from
it
to
the
middle
of
the
staff
were
attached
a
globe
of
medium
size
and
three
hundred
and
purple
ribbands
while
the
lower
part
of
the
staff
was
swathed
in
a
saffron
pall
the
largest
globe
we
are
told
signified
the
sun
the
smaller
the
moon
and
the
smallest
the
stars
and
the
purple
ribbands
stood
for
the
course
of
the
year
being
equal
in
number
to
the
days
comprised
in
it
the
choir
of
virgins
who
followed
the
singing
hymns
may
have
represented
the
muses
who
are
said
to
have
sung
and
played
at
the
marriage
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
down
to
late
times
the
very
spot
in
the
was
shewn
where
they
had
discoursed
their
heavenly
music
we
may
conjecture
that
the
procession
of
the
was
preceded
by
a
dramatic
performance
of
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
and
that
it
was
followed
by
a
pageant
representative
of
the
nuptials
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
in
the
presence
of
the
gods
on
this
hypothesis
harmonia
the
wife
of
cadmus
is
only
another
form
of
his
sister
europa
both
of
them
being
personifications
of
the
moon
accordingly
in
the
samothracian
mysteries
in
which
the
marriage
of
cadmus
and
harmonia
appears
to
have
been
celebrated
it
was
harmonia
and
not
europa
whose
wanderings
were
dramatically
represented
the
gods
who
quitted
olympus
to
grace
the
wedding
by
their
presence
were
probably
represented
in
the
rites
whether
celebrated
at
thebes
or
in
samothrace
by
men
and
women
attired
as
deities
in
like
manner
at
the
marriage
of
a
pharaoh
the
courtiers
masqueraded
in
the
likeness
of
the
egyptian
gods
within
historical
times
the
great
olympic
festival
was
always
held
at
intervals
of
four
not
of
eight
years
yet
it
too
would
seem
to
have
been
based
on
the
octennial
cycle
for
it
always
fell
on
a
full
moon
at
intervals
of
fifty
and
of
lunar
months
alternately
thus
the
total
number
of
lunar
months
comprised
in
two
successive
olympiads
was
which
is
precisely
the
number
of
lunar
months
in
the
octennial
cycle
it
is
possible
that
as
müller
conjectured
the
olympic
games
may
like
the
pythian
have
originally
been
celebrated
at
intervals
of
eight
instead
of
four
years
if
that
was
so
analogy
would
lead
us
to
infer
that
the
festival
was
associated
with
a
mythical
marriage
of
the
sun
and
moon
a
reminiscence
of
such
a
marriage
appears
to
survive
in
the
legend
that
endymion
the
son
of
the
first
king
of
elis
had
fifty
daughters
by
the
moon
and
that
he
set
his
sons
to
run
a
race
for
the
kingdom
at
olympia
for
as
scholars
have
already
perceived
endymion
is
the
sunken
sun
overtaken
by
the
moon
below
the
horizon
and
his
fifty
daughters
by
her
are
the
fifty
lunar
months
of
an
olympiad
or
more
strictly
speaking
of
every
alternate
olympiad
if
the
olympic
festival
always
fell
as
many
authorities
have
maintained
at
the
first
full
moon
after
the
summer
solstice
the
time
would
be
eminently
appropriate
for
a
marriage
of
the
luminaries
since
both
of
them
might
then
be
conceived
to
be
at
the
prime
of
their
vigour
it
has
been
ingeniously
argued
by
a
cook
that
the
olympic
victors
in
the
were
the
lineal
successors
of
the
old
rulers
the
living
embodiments
of
zeus
whose
claims
to
the
kingdom
were
decided
by
a
race
as
in
the
legend
of
endymion
and
his
sons
and
who
reigned
for
a
period
of
four
perhaps
originally
of
eight
years
after
which
they
had
again
like
oenomaus
to
stake
their
right
to
the
throne
on
the
issue
of
a
certainly
the
car
in
which
they
raced
assimilated
them
to
the
who
was
commonly
supposed
to
drive
through
the
sky
in
a
similar
fashion
while
the
crown
of
sacred
olive
which
decked
their
brows
likened
them
to
the
great
god
zeus
himself
whose
glorious
image
at
olympia
wore
a
similar
wreath
but
if
the
victor
in
the
men
s
race
at
olympia
represented
zeus
it
becomes
probable
that
the
victor
in
the
girls
race
which
was
held
every
fourth
year
at
olympia
in
honour
of
hera
represented
in
like
manner
the
god
s
wife
and
that
in
former
days
the
two
together
acted
the
part
of
the
god
and
goddess
in
that
sacred
marriage
of
zeus
and
hera
which
is
known
to
have
been
celebrated
in
many
parts
of
greece
this
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
the
legend
that
the
girls
race
was
instituted
by
hippodamia
in
gratitude
for
her
marriage
with
pelops
for
if
pelops
as
victor
in
the
represented
zeus
his
bride
would
naturally
play
the
part
of
hera
but
under
the
names
of
zeus
and
hera
the
pair
of
olympic
victors
would
seem
to
have
really
personated
the
sun
and
moon
who
were
the
true
heavenly
bridegroom
and
bride
of
the
ancient
octennial
festival
in
the
decline
of
ancient
civilisation
the
old
myth
of
the
marriage
of
the
great
luminaries
was
revived
by
the
crazy
fanatic
and
libertine
the
emperor
heliogabalus
who
fetched
the
image
of
astarte
regarded
as
the
from
carthage
to
rome
and
wedded
it
to
the
image
of
the
syrian
commanding
all
men
at
rome
and
throughout
italy
to
celebrate
with
joy
and
festivity
the
solemn
nuptials
of
the
god
of
the
sun
with
the
goddess
of
the
moon
funeral
games
but
a
different
and
at
first
sight
inconsistent
explanation
of
the
olympic
festival
deserves
to
be
considered
some
of
the
ancients
held
that
all
the
great
games
of
olympic
the
nemean
the
isthmian
and
the
funeral
games
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
dead
thus
the
olympic
games
were
supposed
to
have
been
founded
in
honour
of
pelops
the
great
legendary
hero
who
had
a
sacred
precinct
at
olympia
where
he
was
honoured
above
all
the
other
heroes
and
received
annually
the
sacrifice
of
a
black
ram
once
a
year
too
all
the
lads
of
peloponnese
are
said
to
have
lashed
themselves
on
his
grave
at
olympia
till
the
blood
streamed
down
their
backs
as
a
libation
to
the
departed
hero
similarly
at
roman
funerals
the
women
scratched
their
faces
till
they
bled
for
the
purpose
as
varro
tells
us
of
pleasing
the
ghosts
with
the
sight
of
the
flowing
blood
so
too
among
the
aborigines
of
australia
mourners
sometimes
cut
and
hack
themselves
and
allow
the
streaming
blood
to
drip
on
the
dead
body
of
their
kinsman
or
into
the
grave
among
the
eastern
islanders
of
torres
straits
in
like
manner
youths
who
had
lately
been
initiated
and
girls
who
had
attained
to
puberty
used
to
have
the
lobes
of
their
ears
cut
as
a
mourning
ceremony
and
the
flowing
blood
was
allowed
to
drip
on
the
feet
of
the
corpse
as
a
mark
of
pity
or
sorrow
moreover
young
adults
of
both
sexes
had
patterns
cut
in
their
flesh
with
a
sharp
shell
so
that
the
blood
fell
on
the
dead
body
the
similarity
of
these
savage
rites
to
the
greek
custom
observed
at
the
grave
of
pelops
suggests
that
the
tomb
was
not
a
mere
cenotaph
but
that
it
contained
the
actual
remains
of
the
dead
hero
though
these
have
not
been
discovered
by
the
german
excavators
of
olympia
in
like
manner
the
nemean
games
are
said
to
have
been
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
dead
opheltes
whose
grave
was
shewn
at
nemea
according
to
tradition
the
isthmian
games
were
instituted
in
honour
of
the
dead
melicertes
whose
body
had
been
washed
ashore
at
the
isthmus
of
corinth
it
is
said
that
when
this
happened
a
famine
fell
upon
the
corinthians
and
an
oracle
declared
that
the
evil
would
not
cease
until
the
people
paid
due
obsequies
to
the
remains
of
the
drowned
melicertes
and
honoured
him
with
funeral
games
the
corinthians
complied
with
the
injunction
for
a
short
time
but
as
soon
as
they
omitted
to
celebrate
the
games
the
famine
broke
out
afresh
and
the
oracle
informed
them
that
the
honours
paid
to
melicertes
must
be
eternal
lastly
the
pythian
games
are
said
to
have
been
celebrated
in
honour
of
the
dead
dragon
or
serpent
python
these
greek
traditions
as
to
the
funeral
origin
of
the
great
games
are
strongly
confirmed
by
greek
practice
in
historical
times
thus
in
the
homeric
age
funeral
games
including
wrestling
boxing
and
archery
were
celebrated
in
honour
of
dead
kings
and
heroes
at
their
barrows
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
when
miltiades
the
victor
of
marathon
died
in
the
thracian
chersonese
the
people
offered
sacrifices
to
him
as
their
founder
and
instituted
equestrian
and
athletic
games
in
his
honour
in
which
no
citizen
of
lampsacus
was
allowed
to
contend
near
the
theatre
at
sparta
there
were
two
graves
one
contained
the
bones
of
the
gallant
leonidas
which
had
been
brought
back
from
the
pass
of
thermopylae
to
rest
in
spartan
earth
the
other
held
the
dust
of
king
pausanias
who
commanded
the
greek
armies
on
the
great
day
when
they
routed
the
persian
host
at
plataea
but
who
lived
to
tarnish
his
laurels
and
to
die
a
traitor
s
death
every
year
speeches
were
spoken
over
these
graves
and
games
were
held
in
which
none
but
spartans
might
compete
perhaps
in
the
case
of
pausanias
the
games
were
intended
rather
to
avert
his
anger
than
to
do
him
honour
for
we
are
told
that
wizards
were
fetched
even
from
italy
to
lay
the
traitor
s
unquiet
ghost
again
when
the
spartan
general
brasidas
defending
amphipolis
in
thrace
against
the
athenians
fell
mortally
wounded
before
the
city
and
just
lived
like
wolfe
on
the
heights
of
abraham
to
learn
that
his
men
were
victorious
all
the
allies
in
arms
followed
the
dead
soldier
to
the
grave
and
the
grateful
citizens
fenced
his
tomb
about
sacrificed
to
him
as
a
hero
and
decreed
that
his
memory
should
be
honoured
henceforth
with
games
and
annual
sacrifices
so
too
when
timoleon
the
saviour
of
syracuse
died
in
the
city
which
he
had
delivered
from
tyrants
within
and
defended
against
enemies
without
vast
multitudes
of
men
and
women
crowned
with
garlands
and
clad
in
clean
raiment
attended
all
that
was
mortal
of
their
benefactor
to
the
funeral
pyre
the
voices
of
praise
and
benediction
mingling
with
the
sound
of
lamentations
and
sobs
and
when
at
last
the
bier
was
laid
on
the
pyre
a
herald
chosen
for
his
sonorous
voice
proclaimed
that
the
people
of
syracuse
were
burying
timoleon
and
that
they
would
honour
him
for
all
time
to
come
with
musical
equestrian
and
athletic
games
because
he
had
put
down
the
tyrants
conquered
the
foreign
foe
rebuilt
the
cities
that
had
been
laid
waste
and
restored
their
free
constitutions
to
the
sicilians
in
dedicating
the
great
mausoleum
at
halicarnassus
to
the
soul
of
her
dead
husband
mausolus
his
widow
artemisia
instituted
a
contest
of
eloquence
in
his
memory
prizes
of
money
and
other
valuables
being
offered
to
such
as
should
pronounce
the
most
splendid
panegyrics
on
the
departed
isocrates
himself
is
said
to
have
entered
for
the
prize
but
to
have
been
vanquished
by
his
pupil
theopompus
alexander
the
great
prepared
to
pay
honour
to
his
dead
friend
hephaestion
by
celebrating
athletic
and
musical
contests
on
a
greater
scale
than
had
ever
been
witnessed
before
and
for
this
purpose
he
actually
assembled
three
thousand
competitors
who
shortly
afterwards
contended
at
the
funeral
games
of
the
great
conqueror
himself
nor
were
the
greeks
in
the
habit
of
instituting
games
in
honour
only
of
a
few
distinguished
individuals
they
sometimes
established
them
to
perpetuate
the
memory
or
to
appease
the
ghosts
of
large
numbers
of
men
who
had
perished
on
the
field
of
battle
or
been
massacred
in
cold
blood
when
the
carthaginians
and
tyrrhenians
together
had
beaten
the
phocaeans
in
a
they
landed
their
prisoners
near
agylla
in
etruria
and
stoned
them
all
to
death
after
that
whenever
the
people
of
agylla
or
their
oxen
or
their
sheep
passed
the
scene
of
the
massacre
they
were
attacked
by
a
strange
malady
which
distorted
their
bodies
and
deprived
them
of
the
use
of
their
limbs
so
they
consulted
the
delphic
oracle
and
the
priestess
told
them
that
they
must
offer
great
sacrifices
to
the
dead
phocaeans
and
institute
equestrian
and
athletic
games
in
their
honour
no
doubt
to
appease
the
angry
ghosts
of
the
murdered
men
who
were
supposed
to
be
doing
the
mischief
at
plataea
down
to
the
second
century
of
our
era
might
be
seen
the
graves
of
the
men
who
fell
in
the
great
battle
with
the
persians
sacrifices
were
offered
to
them
every
year
with
great
solemnity
the
chief
magistrate
of
plataea
clad
in
a
purple
robe
washed
with
his
own
hands
the
tombstones
and
anointed
them
with
scented
oil
he
slaughtered
a
black
bull
over
a
burning
pyre
and
called
upon

of

games
were
celebrated
every

in

of
these
heroic

the
principal

being
offered
for
a

to
commemorate
the

slain
in

who
were
buried
in
the
neighbouring

and
sacrifices
were
offered
to
them
at
a
pit
the
games
were
superintended
and
the
sacrifices
offered
by
the
polemarch
or
minister
of

similar
honours
have
been
paid
to
the
spirits
of
the
departed
by
many
other
peoples
both
ancient
and
modern
thus
in
antiquity
the
thracians
burned
or
buried
their
dead
and
having
raised
mounds
over
their
remains
they
held
games
of
all
kinds
on
the
spot
assigning
the
principal
prizes
to
victory
in
single
combat
at
rome
funeral
games
were
celebrated
and
gladiators
fought
in
honour
of
distinguished
men
who
had
just
died
the
games
were
sometimes
held
in
the
forum
thus
in
the
year
when
marcus
aemilius
lepidus
died
who
had
been
twice
consul
his
three
sons
celebrated
funeral
games
in
the
forum
for
three
days
and
pairs
of
gladiators
fought
on
the
occasion
again
in
the
year
funeral
games
were
held
for
four
days
in
the
forum
and
pairs
of
gladiators
fought
in
honour
of
the
deceased
valerius
laevinus
the
expense
of
the
ceremonies
being
defrayed
by
the
two
sons
of
the
dead
man
once
more
when
the
pontifex
maximus
publicius
licinius
crassus
died
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
funeral
games
were
celebrated
in
his
honour
for
three
days
a
hundred
and
twenty
gladiators
fought
and
the
ceremonies
concluded
with
a
banquet
for
which
the
tables
were
spread
in
the
forum
these
games
and
combats
were
doubtless
intended
to
please
and
soothe
the
ghost
of
the
recently
departed
just
as
we
saw
that
roman
women
lacerated
their
faces
for
a
similar
purpose
similarly
when
the
southern
nicobarese
dig
up
the
bones
of
their

clean
them
and
bury
them
again
they
hold
a

the
custom
of
holding
funeral
games
in
honour
of
the
dead
appears
to
be
common
among
the
people
of
the
caucasus
thus
in
circassia
the
anniversary
of

held
at
the
funeral
of

and
prizes
of
cattle
and

are
given
to

poorer

content
themselves
with

similar
celebrations
take
place
on
the
anniversary
of
the
death
in
like
manner
form
a
feature
of
an
annual
festival
of
all
souls
when
the
spirits
of
departed
chewsurs
are
believed
to
revisit
their
old

adults

alike
take

and
so
forth
among

of

two
years
after
a
death
a
memorial
feast
is
held
in
honour
of
the

at
which
animals
are
killed
and
measures
taken
to

the
soul
of

the

figures
prominently
at

the
guests
have
feasted
at
a
long
table
spread
in
the
open
air
the
young
men
perform
evolutions
on
horseback
which
are
said
to
recall
the
tournaments
of
the
middle
ages
and
children
of
eight
or
nine
years
of
age
ride
races
on
horseback
thus
it
appears
that
many
different
peoples
have
been
in
the
habit
of
holding
games
including
in
honour
of
the
dead
and
as
the
ancient
greeks
unquestionably
did
so
within
historical
times
for
men
whose
existence
is
as
little
open
to
question
as
that
of
wellington
and
napoleon
we
can
not
dismiss
as
improbable
the
tradition
that
the
olympic
and
perhaps
other
great
greek
games
were
instituted
to
commemorate
real
men
who
once
lived
died
and
were
buried
on
the
spot
where
the
festivals
were
afterwards
held
when
the
person
so
commemorated
had
been
great
and
powerful
in
his
lifetime
his
ghost
would
be
deemed
great
and
powerful
after
death
and
the
games
celebrated
in
his
honour
might
naturally
attract
crowds
of
spectators
the
need
of
providing
food
and
accommodation
for
the
multitude
which
assembled
on
these
occasions
would
in
turn
draw
numbers
of
hucksters
and
merchants
to
the
spot
and
thus
what
in
its
origin
had
been
a
solemn
religious
ceremony
might
gradually
assume
more
and
more
the
character
of
a
fair
that
is
of
a
concourse
of
people
brought
together
mainly
for
purposes
of
trade
and
amusement
this
theory
might
account
for
the
origin
not
only
of
the
olympic
and
other
greek
games
but
also
for
that
of
the
great
fairs
or
public
assemblies
of
ancient
ireland
which
have
been
compared
not
without
reason
to
the
greek
games
indeed
the
two
most
famous
of
these
irish
festivals
in
which
played
a
prominent
part
are
actually
said
to
have
been
instituted
in
honour
of
the
dead
most
celebrated
of
all
was
the
fair
of
tailltiu
or
tailltin
held
at
a
place
in
the
county
of
meath
which
is
now
called
teltown
on
the
blackwater
midway
between
navan
and
kells
the
festival
lasted
for
a
fortnight
before
lammas
the
first
of
august
and
a
fortnight
after
it
among
the
manly
sports
and
contests
which
formed
a
leading
feature
of
the
fair
held
the
principal
place
but
trade
was
not
neglected
and
among
the
wares
brought
to
market
were
marriageable
women
who
according
to
a
tradition
which
survived
into
the
nineteenth
century
were
bought
and
sold
as
wives
for
one
year
the
very
spot
where
the
marriages
took
place
is
still
pointed
out
by
the
peasantry
they
call
it
marriage
multitudes
flocked
to
the
fair
not
only
from
all
parts
of
ireland
but
even
from
scotland
it
is
officially
recorded
that
in
the
year
the
horses
and
chariots
alone
exclusive
of
the
people
on
foot
extended
in
a
continuous
line
for
more
than
six
english
miles
from
tailltin
to
now
the
hill
of
lloyd
near
kells
the
irish
historians
relate
that
the
fair
of
tailltin
was
instituted
by
lug
in
honour
of
his
tailltiu
whom
he
buried
under
a
great
sepulchral
mound
on
the
spot
ordering
that
a
commemorative
festival
with
games
and
sports
should
be
celebrated
there
annually
for
ever
the
other
great
fair
of
ancient
ireland
was
held
only
once
in
three
years
at
carman
now
called
wexford
in
leinster
it
began
on
lammas
day
the
first
of
august
and
lasted
six
days
a
took
place
on
each
day
of
the
festival
in
different
parts
of
the
green
there
were
separate
markets
for
victuals
for
cattle
and
horses
and
for
gold
and
precious
stuffs
of
the
merchants
harpers
harped
and
pipers
piped
for
the
entertainment
of
the
crowds
and
in
other
parts
of
the
fair
bards
recited
in
the
ears
of
rapt
listeners
old
romantic
tales
of
forays
and
of
battles
and
murders
of
love
and
courtship
and
marriage
prizes
were
awarded
to
the
best
performers
in
every
art
in
the
book
of
ballymote
the
fair
of
carman
or
garman
is
said
to
have
been
founded
in
accordance
with
the
dying
wish
of
a
chief
named
garman
who
was
buried
on
the
spot
after
begging
that
a
fair
of
mourning
should
be
instituted
for
him
and
should
bear
his
name
for
ever
it
was
considered
an
institution
of
great
importance
and
among
the
blessings
promised
to
the
men
of
leinster
from
holding
it
and
duly
celebrating
the
established
games
were
plenty
of
corn
fruit
and
milk
abundance
of
fish
in
their
lakes
and
rivers
domestic
prosperity
and
immunity
from
the
yoke
of
any
other
province
on
the
other
hand
the
evils
to
follow
from
the
neglect
of
this
institution
were
to
be
failure
and
early
greyness
on
them
and
their
nor
were
these
two
great
fairs
the
only
ancient
irish
festivals
of
the
sort
which
are
reported
to
have
been
founded
in
honour
of
the
dead
the
annual
fair
at
emain
is
said
to
have
been
established
to
lament
the
death
of
queen
macha
of
the
golden
hair
who
had
her
palace
on
the
spot
in
short
most
of
the
great
meetings
by
whatever
name
known
had
their
origin
in
funeral
games
tara
tailltenn
tlachtga
ushnagh
cruachan
emain
macha
and
other
less
prominent
are
well
known
as
ancient
pagan
cemeteries
in
all
of
which
many
illustrious
personages
were
interred
and
many
sepulchral
monuments
remain
in
them
to
this
there
was
a
notion
that
carman
was
a
cemetery
that
there
kings
and
queens
had
been
buried
and
that
the
games
and
which
formed
the
principal
attraction
of
the
fair
had
been
instituted
in
honour
of
the
dead
folk
on
whose
graves
the
feet
of
the
assembled
multitude
were
treading
the
same
view
is
taken
of
the
fairs
of
tailltiu
and
cruachan
tailltiu
and
cruachan
were
cemeteries
before
they
served
periodically
as
places
of
assembly
for
business
and
the
tombs
of
the
first
kings
of
ulster
were
at
tailltin
if
we
ask
whether
the
tradition
as
to
the
funeral
origin
of
these
great
irish
fairs
is
true
or
false
it
is
important
to
observe
the
date
at
which
they
were
commonly
celebrated
the
date
was
the
first
of
august
or
lugnasad
that
is
the
or
games
of
lug
as
the
day
is
still
called
in
every
part
of
ireland
this
was
the
date
of
the
great
fair
of
cruachan
as
well
as
of
tailltin
and
carman
now
the
first
of
august
is
our
lammas
day
a
name
derived
from
the
that
is
or
and
the
name
marks
the
day
as
a
mass
or
feast
of
thanksgiving
for
the
of
the
which
in
england
and
ireland
usually
ripen
about
that
time
the
feast
seems
to
have
been
observed
with
bread
of
new
wheat
and
therefore
in
some
parts
of
england
and
even
in
some
near
oxford
the
tenants
are
bound
to
bring
in
wheat
of
that
year
to
their
lord
on
or
before
the
first
of
but
if
the
festival
of
the
first
of
august
was
in
its
origin
an
offering
of
the
of
the
we
can
easily
understand
the
great
importance
which
the
ancient
irish
attached
to
it
and
why
they
should
have
thought
that
its
observance
ensured
a
plentiful
crop
of
corn
as
well
as
abundance
of
fruit
and
milk
and
fish
whereas
the
neglect
of
the
festival
would
entail
the
failure
of
these
things
and
cause
the
hair
of
their
kings
to
turn
prematurely
grey
for
it
is
a
widespread
custom
among
primitive
agricultural
peoples
to
offer
the
of
the
harvest
to
divine
beings
whether
gods
or
spirits
before
any
person
may
eat
of
the
new
crops
and
wherever
such
customs
are
observed
we
may
assume
that
an
omission
to
offer
the
must
be
supposed
to
endanger
the
crops
and
the
general
prosperity
of
the
community
by
exciting
the
wrath
of
the
gods
or
spirits
who
conceive
themselves
to
be
robbed
of
their
dues
now
among
the
divine
beings
who
are
thus
propitiated
the
souls
of
dead
ancestors
take
in
many
tribes
a
prominent
or
even
exclusive
place
and
that
these
ancestors
are
not
creations
of
the
mythical
fancy
but
were
once
men
of
flesh
and
blood
is
sometimes
demonstrated
by
the
substantial
evidence
of
their
skulls
to
which
the
offerings
are
made
and
in
which
the
spirits
are
supposed
to
take
up
their
abode
for
the
purpose
of
partaking
of
the
food
presented
to
them
sometimes
the
ceremony
is
designated
by
the
expressive
name
of
feeding
the
all
this
tends
to
support
the
traditional
explanation
of
the
great
irish
fairs
held
at
the
beginning
of
august
when
the
first
corn
is
ripe
for
if
these
festivals
were
indeed
celebrated
as
they
are
said
to
have
been
at
cemeteries
where
kings
and
other
famous
men
were
buried
and
if
the
and
other
games
which
formed
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
celebrations
were
indeed
instituted
as
they
are
said
to
have
been
in
honour
of
dead
men
and
women
we
can
perfectly
understand
why
the
observance
of
the
festivals
and
the
games
was
supposed
to
ensure
a
plentiful
harvest
and
abundance
of
fruit
and
fish
whereas
the
neglect
to
celebrate
them
was
believed
to
entail
the
failure
of
these
things
so
long
as
the
spirits
of
the
dead
men
and
women
who
were
buried
on
the
spot
received
the
homage
of
their
descendants
in
the
shape
of
funeral
games
and
perhaps
of
so
long
would
they
bless
their
people
with
plenty
by
causing
the
earth
to
bring
forth
its
fruits
the
cows
to
yield
milk
and
the
waters
to
swarm
with
fish
whereas
if
they
deemed
themselves
slighted
and
neglected
they
would
avenge
their
wrongs
by
cutting
off
the
food
supply
and
afflicting
the
people
with
dearth
and
other
calamities
among
these
threatened
calamities
the
premature
greyness
of
the
kings
is
specially
mentioned
and
was
probably
deemed
not
the
least
serious
for
we
have
seen
that
the
welfare
of
the
whole
people
is
often
deemed
to
be
bound
up
with
the
physical
vigour
of
the
king
and
that
the
appearance
of
grey
hairs
on
his
head
and
wrinkles
on
his
face
is
sometimes
viewed
with
apprehension
and
proves
the
signal
for
putting
him
to
death
similarly
the
abchases
of
the
caucasus
imagine
that
if
they
do
not
honour
a
dead
man
by
and
other
festivities
his
ghost
will
be
angry
with
them
and
visit
his
displeasure
on
their
persons
and
their
property
in
this
connexion
it
is
significant
that
the
celebration
of
the
isthmian
games
at
corinth
in
honour
of
the
dead
melicertes
is
said
to
have
been
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
staying
a
famine
and
that
the
intermission
of
the
games
was
immediately
followed
by
a
fresh
visitation
of
the
calamity
analogy
suggests
that
the
famine
may
have
been
ascribed
to
the
anger
of
the
ghost
of
melicertes
at
the
neglect
of
his
funeral
honours
thus
on
the
whole
the
theory
of
the
funeral
origin
of
the
great
greek
games
is
supported
not
only
by
greek
tradition
and
greek
custom
but
by
the
evidence
of
parallel
customs
observed
in
many
lands
yet
the
theory
seems
hardly
adequate
to
explain
all
the
features
in
the
legends
of
the
foundation
and
early
history
of
the
olympic
games
for
if
these
contests
were
instituted
merely
to
please
and
propitiate
the
soul
of
a
prince
named
pelops
who
was
buried
on
the
spot
what
are
we
to
make
of
the
tradition
that
the
was
founded
in
order
to
determine
the
successor
to
the
kingdom
or
of
the
similar
though
not
identical
tradition
that
the
kingdom
and
the
hand
of
the
king
s
daughter
were
awarded
as
the
prize
to
him
who
could
vanquish
the
king
in
a
chariot
race
while
death
was
the
penalty
inflicted
on
the
beaten
charioteer
such
legends
can
hardly
have
been
pure
fictions
they
probably
reflect
some
real
custom
observed
at
olympia
we
may
perhaps
combine
them
with
the
tradition
of
the
funeral
origin
of
the
games
by
supposing
that
victory
in
the
race
entitled
the
winner
to
reign
as
a
divine
king
the
embodiment
of
a
god
for
a
term
of
years
whether
four
or
eight
years
according
to
the
interval
between
successive
celebrations
of
the
festival
that
when
the
term
had
expired
the
human
god
must
again
submit
his
title
to
the
crown
to
the
hazard
of
a
race
for
the
purpose
of
proving
that
his
bodily
vigour
was
unimpaired
that
if
he
failed
to
do
so
he
lost
both
his
kingdom
and
his
life
and
lastly
that
the
spirits
of
these
divine
kings
like
those
of
the
divine
kings
of
the
shilluk
were
worshipped
with
sacrifices
at
their
graves
and
were
thought
to
delight
in
the
spectacle
of
the
games
which
reminded
them
of
the
laurels
they
had
themselves
won
long
ago
amid
the
plaudits
of
a
vast
multitude
in
the
sunshine
and
dust
of
the
before
they
joined
the
shadowy
company
of
ghosts
in
the
darkness
and
silence
of
the
tomb
the
theory
would
explain
the
existence
of
the
sacred
precinct
of
pelops
at
olympia
where
the
black
rams
the
characteristic
offerings
to
the
dead
were
sacrificed
to
the
hero
and
where
the
young
men
lashed
themselves
till
the
blood
dripped
from
their
backs
on
the
sight
to
the
grim
bloodthirsty
ghost
lurking
unseen
below
perhaps
too
the
theory
may
explain
the
high
mound
at
some
distance
from
olympia
which
passed
for
the
grave
of
the
suitors
of
hippodamia
to
whose
shades
pelops
is
said
to
have
sacrificed
as
to
heroes
every
year
it
is
possible
that
the
men
buried
in
this
great
barrow
were
not
as
tradition
had
it
the
suitors
who
contended
in
the
for
the
hand
of
hippodamia
and
being
defeated
were
slain
by
her
relentless
father
they
may
have
been
men
who
like
pelops
himself
had
won
the
kingdom
and
a
bride
in
the
and
after
enjoying
the
regal
dignity
and
posing
as
incarnate
deities
for
a
term
of
years
had
been
finally
defeated
in
the
race
and
put
to
death
whatever
may
be
thought
of
these
speculations
the
great
olympic
festival
can
not
have
been
like
our
lammas
a
harvest
festival
the
quadrennial
period
of
the
celebration
and
the
season
of
the
year
at
which
it
fell
about
halfway
between
the
of
early
summer
and
the
vintage
of
alike
exclude
the
supposition
and
alike
point
to
an
astronomical
not
an
agricultural
basis
of
the
solemnity
accordingly
we
seem
driven
to
conclude
that
if
the
winners
male
and
female
in
the
olympic
games
indeed
represented
divinities
these
divinities
must
have
been
personifications
of
astronomical
not
agricultural
powers
in
short
that
the
victors
posed
as
embodiments
of
the
sun
and
moon
then
at
the
prime
of
their
radiant
power
and
glory
whose
meeting
in
the
heavenly
bridechamber
of
the
sky
after
years
of
separation
was
mimicked
and
magically
promoted
by
the
nuptials
of
their
human
representatives
on
earth
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
in
the
foregoing
discussion
it
has
been
suggested
that
delphi
thebes
salamis
and
athens
were
once
ruled
by
kings
who
had
in
modern
language
a
serpent
or
dragon
for
their
crest
and
were
believed
to
migrate
at
death
into
the
bodies
of
the
beasts
but
these
legends
of
the
dragon
admit
of
another
and
at
first
sight
at
least
discrepant
explanation
it
is
difficult
to
separate
them
from
those
similar
tales
of
the
slaughter
of
a
great
dragon
which
are
current
in
many
lands
and
have
commonly
been
interpreted
as
in
other
words
as
personifications
of
physical
phenomena
of
such
tales
the
oldest
known
versions
are
the
ancient
babylonian
and
the
ancient
indian
the
babylonian
myth
relates
how
in
the
beginning
the
mighty
god
marduk
fought
and
killed
the
great
dragon
tiamat
an
embodiment
of
the
primaeval
watery
chaos
and
how
after
his
victory
he
created
the
present
heaven
and
earth
by
splitting
the
huge
carcase
of
the
monster
into
halves
and
setting
one
of
them
up
to
form
the
sky
while
the
other
half
apparently
he
used
to
fashion
the
earth
thus
the
story
is
a
myth
of
creation
in
language
which
its
authors
doubtless
understood
literally
but
which
more
advanced
thinkers
afterwards
interpreted
figuratively
it
describes
how
confusion
was
reduced
to
order
how
a
cosmos
emerged
from
chaos
the
account
of
creation
given
in
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
which
has
been
so
much
praised
for
its
simple
grandeur
and
sublimity
is
merely
a
rationalised
version
of
the
old
myth
of
the
fight
with
the
dragon
a
myth
which
for
crudity
of
thought
deserves
to
rank
with
the
quaint
fancies
of
the
lowest
savages
again
the
indian
myth
embodied
in
the
hymns
of
the
rigveda
tells
how
the
strong
and
valiant
god
indra
conquered
a
great
dragon
or
serpent
named
vṛtra
which
had
obstructed
the
waters
so
that
they
could
not
flow
he
slew
the
monster
with
his
bolt
and
then
the
springs
gushed
in
rivers
to
the
sea
and
what
he
did
once
he
continues
to
do
again
and
again
he
renews
the
conflict
again
and
again
he
slays
the
dragon
and
releases
the
imprisoned
waters
prayers
are
addressed
to
him
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
do
so
in
the
future
even
priests
on
earth
sometimes
associate
themselves
with
indra
in
his
battles
with
the
dragon
the
worshipper
is
said
to
have
placed
the
bolt
in
the
god
s
hands
and
the
sacrifice
is
spoken
of
as
having
helped
the
weapon
to
slay
the
monster
thus
the
feat
attributed
to
indra
would
seem
to
be
a
mythical
account
not
so
much
of
creation
as
of
some
regularly
recurring
phenomenon
it
has
been
plausibly
interpreted
as
a
description
of
the
bursting
of
the
first
storms
of
rain
and
thunder
after
the
torrid
heat
of
an
indian
summer
at
such
times
all
nature
exhausted
by
the
drought
longs
for
coolness
and
moisture
day
after
day
men
and
cattle
may
be
tormented
by
the
sight
of
clouds
that
gather
and
then
pass
away
without
disburdening
themselves
of
their
contents
at
last
the
struggle
between
the
rival
forces
comes
to
a
crisis
the
sky
darkens
thunder
peals
lightning
flashes
and
the
welcome
rain
descends
in
sheets
drenching
the
parched
earth
and
flooding
the
rivers
such
a
battle
of
the
elements
might
well
present
itself
to
the
primitive
mind
in
the
guise
of
a
conflict
between
a
maleficent
dragon
of
drought
and
a
beneficent
god
of
thunder
and
rain
the
has
swallowed
the
waters
and
keeps
them
shut
up
in
the
black
coils
of
his
sinuous
body
the
god
cleaves
the
monster
s
belly
with
his
and
the
imprisoned
waters
escape
in
the
form
of
dripping
rain
and
rushing
stream
in
other
countries
a
similar
myth
might
with
appropriate
variations
of
detail
express
in
like
manner
the
passage
of
one
season
into
another
for
example
in
more
rigorous
climates
the
dragon
might
stand
for
the
dreary
winter
and
the
for
the
genial
summer
the
myths
of
apollo
and
the
python
of
george
and
the
dragon
have
thus
been
interpreted
as
symbolising
the
victory
of
summer
over
winter
similarly
it
has
been
held
with
much
probability
that
the
babylonian
legend
of
marduk
and
tiamat
reflects
the
annual
change
which
transforms
the
valley
of
the
euphrates
in
spring
during
the
winter
the
wide
babylonian
plain
flooded
by
the
heavy
rains
looks
like
a
sea
for
which
the
babylonian
word
is
then
comes
the
spring
when
with
the
growing
power
of
the
sun
the
clouds
vanish
the
waters
subside
and
dry
land
and
vegetation
appear
once
more
on
this
hypothesis
the
dragon
tiamat
represents
the
clouds
the
rain
the
floods
of
winter
while
marduk
stands
for
the
vernal
or
summer
sun
which
dispels
the
powers
of
darkness
and
moisture
but
if
the
combat
of
marduk
and
tiamat
was
primarily
a
mythical
description
of
the
babylonian
spring
it
would
seem
that
its
cosmogonical
significance
as
an
account
of
creation
must
have
been
an
the
early
philosophers
who
meditated
on
the
origin
of
things
may
have
pictured
to
themselves
the
creation
or
evolution
of
the
world
on
the
analogy
of
the
great
changes
which
outside
the
tropics
pass
over
the
face
of
nature
every
year
in
these
changes
it
is
not
hard
to
discern
or
to
imagine
a
conflict
between
two
hostile
forces
or
principles
the
principle
of
construction
or
of
life
and
the
principle
of
destruction
or
of
death
victory
inclining
now
to
the
one
and
now
to
the
other
according
as
winter
yields
to
spring
or
summer
fades
into
autumn
it
would
be
natural
enough
to
suppose
that
the
same
mighty
rivals
which
still
wage
war
on
each
other
had
done
so
from
the
beginning
and
that
the
formation
of
the
universe
as
it
now
exists
had
resulted
from
the
shock
of
their
battle
on
this
theory
the
creation
of
the
world
is
repeated
every
spring
and
its
dissolution
is
threatened
every
autumn
the
one
is
proclaimed
by
summer
s
gay
heralds
the
opening
flowers
the
other
is
whispered
by
winter
s
sad
harbingers
the
yellow
leaves
here
as
elsewhere
the
old
creed
is
echoed
by
the
poet
s
fancy
alios
prima
crescentis
origine
dies
aliumve
habuisse
ver
illud

flatibus

primae
lucem
pecudes

progenies
duris

extulit

silvis
et

thus
the
ceremonies
which
in
many
lands
have
been
performed
to
hasten
the
departure
of
winter
or
stay
the
flight
of
summer
are
in
a
sense
attempts
to
create
the
world
afresh
to
it
nearer
to
the
heart
s
but
if
we
would
set
ourselves
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
sages
who
devised
means
so
feeble
to
accomplish
a
purpose
so
immeasurably
vast
we
must
divest
ourselves
of
our
modern
conceptions
of
the
immensity
of
the
universe
and
of
the
pettiness
and
insignificance
of
man
s
place
in
it
we
must
imagine
the
infinitude
of
space
shrunk
to
a
few
miles
the
infinitude
of
time
contracted
to
a
few
generations
to
the
savage
the
mountains
that
bound
the
visible
horizon
or
the
sea
that
stretches
away
to
meet
it
is
the
world
s
end
beyond
these
narrow
limits
his
feet
have
never
strayed
and
even
his
imagination
fails
to
conceive
what
lies
across
the
waste
of
waters
or
the
far
blue
hills
of
the
future
he
hardly
thinks
and
of
the
past
he
knows
only
what
has
been
handed
down
to
him
by
word
of
mouth
from
his
savage
forefathers
to
suppose
that
a
world
thus
circumscribed
in
space
and
time
was
created
by
the
efforts
or
the
fiat
of
a
being
like
himself
imposes
no
great
strain
on
his
credulity
and
he
may
without
much
difficulty
imagine
that
he
himself
can
annually
repeat
the
work
of
creation
by
his
charms
and
incantations
and
once
a
horde
of
savages
had
instituted
magical
ceremonies
for
the
renewal
or
preservation
of
all
things
the
force
of
custom
and
tradition
would
tend
to
maintain
them
in
practice
long
after
the
old
narrow
ideas
of
the
universe
had
been
superseded
by
more
adequate
conceptions
and
the
tribe
had
expanded
into
a
nation
neither
in
babylonia
nor
in
india
indeed
so
far
as
i
am
aware
is
there
any
direct
evidence
that
the
story
of
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
was
ever
acted
as
a
or
magical
rite
for
the
sake
of
bringing
about
those
natural
events
which
it
describes
in
figurative
language
but
analogy
leads
us
to
conjecture
that
in
both
countries
the
myth
may
have
been
recited
if
not
acted
as
an
incantation
for
the
purpose
i
have
indicated
at
babylon
the
recitation
may
have
formed
part
of
the
great
new
year
festival
of
marduk
which
under
the
name
of
zagmuk
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
about
the
vernal
equinox
in
this
connexion
it
may
not
be
without
significance
that
one
version
of
the
babylonian
legend
of
creation
has
been
found
inscribed
on
a
tablet
of
which
the
reverse
exhibits
an
incantation
intended
to
be
recited
for
the
purification
of
the
temple
of
in
borsippa
now
was
the
temple
of
nabu
or
nebo
a
god
closely
associated
if
not
originally
identical
with
marduk
indeed
hammurabi
the
great
king
of
babylon
dedicated
the
temple
in
question
to
marduk
and
not
to
nabu
it
seems
not
improbable
therefore
that
the
creation
legend
in
which
marduk
played
so
important
a
part
was
recited
as
an
incantation
at
the
purification
of
the
temple
the
ceremony
perhaps
took
place
at
the
zagmuk
festival
when
the
image
of
nabu
was
solemnly
brought
in
procession
from
his
temple
in
borsippa
to
the
great
temple
of
marduk
in
babylon
moreover
it
was
believed
that
at
this
great
festival
the
fates
were
determined
by
marduk
or
nabu
for
the
ensuing
year
now
the
creation
myth
relates
how
after
he
had
slain
the
dragon
marduk
wrested
the
tablets
of
destiny
from
ningu
the
paramour
of
tiamat
sealed
them
with
a
seal
and
laid
them
on
his
breast
we
may
conjecture
that
the
dramatic
representation
of
this
incident
formed
part
of
the
annual
determination
of
the
fates
at
zagmuk
in
short
it
seems
probable
that
the
whole
myth
of
creation
was
annually
recited
and
acted
at
this
great
spring
festival
as
a
charm
to
dispel
the
storms
and
floods
of
winter
and
to
hasten
the
coming
of
summer
wherever
sacred
dramas
of
this
sort
were
acted
as
magical
rites
for
the
regulation
of
the
seasons
it
would
be
natural
that
the
chief
part
should
be
played
by
the
king
at
first
in
his
character
of
head
magician
and
afterwards
as
representative
and
embodiment
of
the
beneficent
god
who
vanquishes
the
powers
of
evil
if
therefore
the
myth
of
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
was
ever
acted
with
this
intention
the
king
would
appropriately
figure
in
the
play
as
the
victorious
champion
while
the
defeated
monster
would
be
represented
by
an
actor
of
inferior
rank
but
it
is
possible
that
under
certain
circumstances
the
distribution
of
parts
in
the
drama
might
be
somewhat
different
where
the
tenure
of
the
regal
office
was
limited
to
a
fixed
time
at
the
end
of
which
the
king
was
inexorably
put
to
death
the
fatal
part
of
the
dragon
might
be
assigned
to
the
monarch
as
the
representative
of
the
old
order
the
old
year
or
the
old
cycle
which
was
passing
away
while
the
part
of
the
victorious
god
or
hero
might
be
supported
by
his
successor
and
executioner
an
hypothesis
of
this
latter
sort
would
to
a
certain
extent
reconcile
the
two
apparently
discrepant
interpretations
of
the
myth
which
have
been
discussed
in
the
preceding
pages
and
which
for
the
sake
of
distinction
may
be
called
the
totemic
and
the
cosmological
interpretations
respectively
the
serpent
or
dragon
might
be
the
sacred
animal
or
totem
of
the
royal
house
at
the
same
time
that
it
stood
mythically
for
certain
cosmological
phenomena
whether
moisture
or
drought
cold
or
heat
winter
or
summer
in
like
manner
any
other
species
of
animal
which
served
as
the
totem
of
the
royal
family
might
simultaneously
possess
a
cosmological
significance
as
the
symbol
of
an
elemental
power
thus
at
cnossus
as
we
have
seen
reason
to
think
the
bull
was
at
once
the
king
s
crest
and
an
emblem
of
the
sun
similarly
in
egypt
the
hawk
was
the
symbol
both
of
the
sun
and
of
the
king
the
oldest
royal
capital
known
to
us
was
hieraconpolis
or
and
the
first
egyptian
king
of
whom
we
hear
had
for
his
only
royal
title
the
name
of
hawk
at
the
same
time
the
hawk
was
with
the
egyptians
an
emblem
of
the
sun
hawks
were
kept
in
the
s
temple
and
the
deity
himself
was
commonly
represented
in
art
as
a
man
with
a
hawk
s
head
and
the
disc
of
the
sun
above
it
however
i
am
fully
sensible
of
the
slipperiness
and
uncertainty
of
the
ground
i
am
treading
and
it
is
with
great
diffidence
that
i
submit
these
speculations
to
the
judgment
of
my
readers
the
subject
of
ancient
mythology
is
involved
in
dense
mists
which
it
is
not
always
possible
to
penetrate
and
illumine
even
with
the
lamp
of
the
comparative
method
demonstration
in
such
matters
is
rarely
if
ever
attainable
the
utmost
that
a
candid
enquirer
can
claim
for
his
conclusions
is
a
reasonable
degree
of
probability
future
researches
may
clear
up
the
obscurity
which
still
rests
on
the
myth
of
the
slaughter
of
the
dragon
and
may
thereby
ascertain
what
measure
of
truth
if
any
there
is
in
the
suggested
interpretations
triennial
tenure
of
the
kingship
in
the
province
of
lagos
which
forms
part
of
southern
nigeria
the
ijebu
tribe
of
the
yoruba
race
is
divided
into
two
branches
which
are
known
respectively
as
the
ijebu
ode
and
the
ijebu
remon
the
ode
branch
of
the
tribe
is
ruled
by
a
chief
who
bears
the
title
of
awujale
and
is
surrounded
by
a
great
deal
of
mystery
down
to
recent
times
his
face
might
not
be
seen
even
by
his
own
subjects
and
if
circumstances
obliged
him
to
communicate
with
them
he
did
so
through
a
screen
which
hid
him
from
view
the
other
or
remon
branch
of
the
ijebu
tribe
is
governed
by
a
chief
who
ranks
below
the
awujale
john
parkinson
was
informed
that
in
former
times
this
subordinate
chief
used
to
be
killed
with
ceremony
after
a
rule
of
three
years
as
the
country
is
now
under
british
protection
the
custom
of
putting
the
chief
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
three
years
reign
has
long
been
abolished
and
parkinson
was
unable
to
ascertain
any
particulars
on
the
subject
annual
tenure
of
the
kingship
at
babylon
within
historical
times
the
tenure
of
the
kingly
office
was
in
practice
lifelong
yet
in
theory
it
would
seem
to
have
been
merely
annual
for
every
year
at
the
festival
of
zagmuk
the
king
had
to
renew
his
power
by
seizing
the
hands
of
the
image
of
marduk
in
his
great
temple
of
esagil
at
babylon
even
when
babylon
passed
under
the
power
of
assyria
the
monarchs
of
that
country
were
expected
to
legalise
their
claim
to
the
throne
every
year
by
coming
to
babylon
and
performing
the
ancient
ceremony
at
the
festival
and
some
of
them
found
the
obligation
so
burdensome
that
rather
than
discharge
it
they
renounced
the
title
of
king
altogether
and
contented
themselves
with
the
humbler
one
of
governor
further
it
would
appear
that
in
remote
times
though
not
within
the
historical
period
the
kings
of
babylon
or
their
barbarous
predecessors
forfeited
not
merely
their
crown
but
their
life
at
the
end
of
a
year
s
tenure
of
office
at
least
this
is
the
conclusion
to
which
the
following
evidence
seems
to
point
according
to
the
historian
berosus
who
as
a
babylonian
priest
spoke
with
ample
knowledge
there
was
annually
celebrated
in
babylon
a
festival
called
the
sacaea
it
began
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
month
lous
and
lasted
for
five
days
during
these
five
days
masters
and
servants
changed
places
the
servants
giving
orders
and
the
masters
obeying
them
a
prisoner
condemned
to
death
was
dressed
in
the
king
s
robes
seated
on
the
king
s
throne
allowed
to
issue
whatever
commands
he
pleased
to
eat
drink
and
enjoy
himself
and
to
lie
with
the
king
s
concubines
but
at
the
end
of
the
five
days
he
was
stripped
of
his
royal
robes
scourged
and
hanged
or
impaled
during
his
brief
term
of
office
he
bore
the
title
of
zoganes
this
custom
might
perhaps
have
been
explained
as
merely
a
grim
jest
perpetrated
in
a
season
of
jollity
at
the
expense
of
an
unhappy
criminal
but
one
leave
given
to
the
mock
king
to
enjoy
the
king
s
decisive
against
this
interpretation
considering
the
jealous
seclusion
of
an
oriental
despot
s
harem
we
may
be
quite
certain
that
permission
to
invade
it
would
never
have
been
granted
by
the
despot
least
of
all
to
a
condemned
criminal
except
for
the
very
gravest
cause
this
cause
could
hardly
be
other
than
that
the
condemned
man
was
about
to
die
in
the
king
s
stead
and
that
to
make
the
substitution
perfect
it
was
necessary
he
should
enjoy
the
full
rights
of
royalty
during
his
brief
reign
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
substitution
the
rule
that
the
king
must
be
put
to
death
either
on
the
appearance
of
any
symptom
of
bodily
decay
or
at
the
end
of
a
fixed
period
is
certainly
one
which
sooner
or
later
the
kings
would
seek
to
abolish
or
modify
we
have
seen
that
in
ethiopia
sofala
and
eyeo
the
rule
was
boldly
set
aside
by
enlightened
monarchs
and
that
in
calicut
the
old
custom
of
killing
the
king
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
was
changed
into
a
permission
granted
to
any
one
at
the
end
of
the
twelve
years
period
to
attack
the
king
and
in
the
event
of
killing
him
to
reign
in
his
stead
though
as
the
king
took
care
at
these
times
to
be
surrounded
by
his
guards
the
permission
was
little
more
than
a
form
another
way
of
modifying
the
stern
old
rule
is
seen
in
the
babylonian
custom
just
described
when
the
time
drew
near
for
the
king
to
be
put
to
death
in
babylon
this
appears
to
have
been
at
the
end
of
a
single
year
s
reign
he
abdicated
for
a
few
days
during
which
a
temporary
king
reigned
and
suffered
in
his
stead
at
first
the
temporary
king
may
have
been
an
innocent
person
possibly
a
member
of
the
king
s
own
family
but
with
the
growth
of
civilisation
the
sacrifice
of
an
innocent
person
would
be
revolting
to
the
public
sentiment
and
accordingly
a
condemned
criminal
would
be
invested
with
the
brief
and
fatal
sovereignty
in
the
sequel
we
shall
find
other
examples
of
a
dying
criminal
representing
a
dying
god
for
we
must
not
forget
that
as
the
case
of
the
shilluk
kings
clearly
shews
the
king
is
slain
in
his
character
of
a
god
or
a
demigod
his
death
and
resurrection
as
the
only
means
of
perpetuating
the
divine
life
unimpaired
being
deemed
necessary
for
the
salvation
of
his
people
and
the
world
if
at
babylon
before
the
dawn
of
history
the
king
himself
used
to
be
slain
at
the
festival
of
the
sacaea
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
sacaea
was
no
other
than
zagmuk
or
zakmuk
the
great
festival
at
which
down
to
historical
times
the
king
s
power
had
to
be
formally
renewed
by
a
religious
ceremony
in
the
temple
of
marduk
the
theory
of
the
identity
of
the
festivals
is
indeed
strongly
supported
by
many
considerations
and
has
been
accepted
by
some
eminent
scholars
but
it
has
to
encounter
a
serious
chronological
difficulty
since
zagmuk
fell
about
the
equinox
in
spring
whereas
the
sacaea
according
to
berosus
was
held
on
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
lous
which
was
the
tenth
month
of
the
calendar
and
appears
to
have
nearly
coincided
with
july
the
question
of
the
sameness
or
difference
of
these
festivals
will
be
discussed
later
on
here
it
is
to
be
observed
that
zagmuk
was
apparently
celebrated
in
assyria
as
well
as
in
babylonia
for
at
the
end
of
his
great
inscription
esarhaddon
king
of
assyria
expresses
a
wish
that
it
may
be
granted
to
him
to
muster
all
his
and
so
forth
every
year
at
zagmuk
in
his
palace
but
whether
the
power
of
the
assyrian
kings
had
like
that
of
the
babylonian
monarchs
to
be
annually
renewed
at
this
festival
we
do
not
know
however
a
trace
of
an
annual
tenure
of
the
kingly
office
in
assyria
may
perhaps
as
brockelmann
thinks
be
detected
in
the
rule
that
an
assyrian
king
regularly
gave
his
name
only
to
a
single
year
of
his
reign
while
all
the
other
years
were
named
after
certain
officers
and
provincial
governors
about
thirty
in
number
who
were
appointed
for
this
purpose
and
succeeded
each
other
according
to
a
fixed
rotation
but
we
know
too
little
about
the
institution
of
the
or
eponymate
to
allow
us
to
press
this
argument
for
an
annual
tenure
of
the
kingship
in
assyria
a
reminiscence
of
zagmuk
seems
to
linger
in
the
belief
of
the
yezidis
that
on
s
day
god
sits
on
his
throne
arranging
the
decrees
for
the
coming
year
assigning
to
dignitaries
their
various
offices
and
delivering
to
them
their
credentials
under
his
signature
and
seal
the
view
that
at
babylon
the
condemned
prisoner
who
wore
the
royal
robes
was
slain
as
a
substitute
for
the
king
may
be
supported
by
the
practice
of
west
africa
where
at
the
funeral
of
a
king
slaves
used
sometimes
to
be
dressed
up
as
ministers
of
state
and
then
sacrificed
in
that
character
instead
of
the
real
ministers
their
masters
who
purchased
for
a
sum
of
money
the
privilege
of
thus
dying
by
proxy
such
vicarious
sacrifices
were
witnessed
by
catholic
missionaries
at
porto
novo
on
the
slave
coast
a
vestige
of
a
practice
of
putting
the
king
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
year
s
reign
appears
to
have
survived
in
the
festival
called
macahity
which
used
to
be
celebrated
in
hawaii
during
the
last
month
of
the
year
about
a
hundred
years
ago
a
russian
voyager
described
the
custom
as
follows
the
taboo
macahity
is
not
unlike
to
our
festival
of
christmas
it
continues
a
whole
month
during
which
the
people
amuse
themselves
with
dances
plays
and
of
every
kind
the
king
must
open
this
festival
wherever
he
is
on
this
occasion
his
majesty
dresses
himself
in
his
richest
cloak
and
helmet
and
is
paddled
in
a
canoe
along
the
shore
followed
sometimes
by
many
of
his
subjects
he
embarks
early
and
must
finish
his
excursion
at
the
strongest
and
most
expert
of
the
warriors
is
chosen
to
receive
him
on
his
landing
this
warrior
watches
the
canoe
along
the
beach
and
as
soon
as
the
king
lands
and
has
thrown
off
his
cloak
he
darts
his
spear
at
him
from
a
distance
of
about
thirty
paces
and
the
king
must
either
catch
the
spear
in
his
hand
or
suffer
from
it
there
is
no
jesting
in
the
business
having
caught
it
he
carries
it
under
his
arm
with
the
sharp
end
downwards
into
the
temple
or
heavoo
on
his
entrance
the
assembled
multitude
begin
their
and
immediately
the
air
is
obscured
by
clouds
of
spears
made
for
the
occasion
with
blunted
ends
hamamea
the
king
has
been
frequently
advised
to
abolish
this
ridiculous
ceremony
in
which
he
risks
his
life
every
year
but
to
no
effect
his
answer
always
is
that
he
is
as
able
to
catch
a
spear
as
any
one
on
the
island
is
to
throw
it
at
him
during
the
macahity
all
punishments
are
remitted
throughout
the
country
and
no
person
can
leave
the
place
in
which
he
commences
these
holidays
let
the
affair
be
ever
so
diurnal
tenure
of
the
kingship
that
a
king
should
regularly
have
been
put
to
death
at
the
close
of
a
year
s
reign
will
hardly
appear
improbable
when
we
learn
that
to
this
day
there
is
still
a
kingdom
in
which
the
reign
and
the
life
of
the
sovereign
are
limited
to
a
single
day
in
ngoio
a
province
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
congo
in
west
africa
the
rule
obtains
that
the
chief
who
assumes
the
cap
of
sovereignty
is
always
killed
on
the
night
after
his
coronation
the
right
of
succession
lies
with
the
chief
of
the
musurongo
but
we
need
not
wonder
that
he
does
not
exercise
it
and
that
the
throne
stands
vacant
no
one
likes
to
lose
his
life
for
a
few
hours

on

chapter
iii
the
slaying
of
the
king
in
legend
if
a
custom
of
putting
kings
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
set
term
has
prevailed
in
many
lands
it
is
natural
enough
that
reminiscences
of
it
should
survive
in
tradition
long
after
the
custom
itself
has
been
abolished
in
the
history
of
the
holy
we
read
how
lancelot
roamed
through
strange
lands
and
forests
seeking
adventures
till
he
came
to
a
fair
and
wide
plain
lying
without
a
city
that
seemed
of
right
great
lordship
as
he
rode
across
the
plain
the
people
came
forth
from
the
city
to
welcome
him
with
the
sound
of
flutes
and
viols
and
many
instruments
of
music
when
he
asked
them
what
meant
all
this
joy
sir
said
they
all
this
joy
is
made
along
of
you
and
all
these
instruments
of
music
are
moved
to
joy
and
sound
of
gladness
for
your
but
wherefore
for
me
saith
lancelot
that
shall
you
know
well
betimes
say
they
this
city
began
to
burn
and
to
melt
in
one
of
the
houses
from
the
very
same
hour
that
our
king
was
dead
nor
might
the
fire
be
quenched
nor
ever
will
be
quenched
until
such
time
as
we
have
a
king
that
shall
be
lord
of
the
city
and
of
the
honour
thereunto
belonging
and
on
new
year
s
day
behoveth
him
to
be
crowned
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
then
shall
the
fire
be
quenched
for
otherwise
may
it
never
be
put
out
nor
extinguished
wherefore
have
we
come
to
meet
you
to
give
you
the
royalty
for
we
have
been
told
that
you
are
a
good
lords
saith
lancelot
of
such
a
kingdom
have
i
no
need
and
god
defend
me
from
sir
say
they
you
may
not
be
defended
thereof
for
you
come
into
this
land
at
hazard
and
great
grief
would
it
be
that
so
good
a
land
as
you
see
this
is
were
burnt
and
melted
away
by
the
default
of
one
single
man
and
the
lordship
is
right
great
and
this
will
be
right
great
worship
to
yourself
that
on

you
should
be
crowned
in

and
thus
save
this

there
be
great

refuseth
right
stoutly
and
saith
that
their
king
nor
their
lord
will
he
never
be
in
no
such
sort
thereupon
behold
you
a
dwarf
that
entereth
into
the
city
leading
one
of
the
fairest
dames
that
be
in
any
kingdom
and
asketh
whereof
this
joy
and
this
murmuring
may
be
they
tell
him
they
are
fain
to
make
the
knight
king
but
that
he
is
not
minded
to
allow
them
and
they
tell
him
the
whole
manner
of
the
fire
the
dwarf
and
the
damsel
are
alighted
then
they
mount
up
to
the
palace
the
dwarf
calleth
the
provosts
of
the
city
and
the
greater
lords
lords
saith
he
sith
that
this
knight
is
not
willing
to
be
king
i
will
be
so
willingly
and
i
will
govern
the
city
at
your
pleasure
and
do
whatsoever
you
have
devised
to
in
faith
sith
that
the
knight
refuseth
this
honour
and
you
desire
to
have
it
willingly
will
we
grant
it
you
and
he
may
go
his
way
and
his
road
for
herein
do
we
declare
him
wholly
therewithal
they
set
the
crown
on
the
dwarf
s
head
and
lancelot
maketh
great
joy
thereof
he
taketh
his
leave
and
they
commend
him
to
god
and
so
remounteth
he
on
his
horse
and
goeth
his
way
through
the
midst
of
the
city
all
armed
the
dames
and
damsels
say
that
he
would
not
be
king
for
that
he
had
no
mind
to
die
so
a
story
of
the
same
sort
is
told
of
ujjain
the
ancient
capital
of
malwa
in
western
india
where
the
renowned
king
vikramaditya
is
said
to
have
held
his
court
gathering
about
him
a
circle
of
poets
and
scholars
tradition
has
it
that
once
on
a
time
an
with
a
legion
of
devils
at
his
command
took
up
his
abode
in
ujjain
the
inhabitants
of
which
he
vexed
and
devoured
many
had
fallen
a
prey
to
him
and
others
had
abandoned
the
country
to
save
their
lives
the
once
populous
city
was
fast
being
converted
into
a
desert
at
last
the
principal
citizens
meeting
in
council
besought
the
fiend
to
reduce
his
rations
to
one
man
a
day
who
would
be
duly
delivered
up
to
him
in
order
that
the
rest
might
enjoy
a
day
s
repose
the
demon
closed
with
the
offer
but
required
that
the
man
whose
turn
it
was
to
be
sacrificed
should
mount
the
throne
and
exercise
the
royal
power
for
a
single
day
all
the
grandees
of
the
kingdom
submitting
to
his
commands
and
everybody
yielding
him
the
most
absolute
obedience
necessity
obliged
the
citizens
to
accept
these
hard
terms
their
names
were
entered
on
a
list
every
day
one
of
them
in
his
turn
ruled
from
morning
to
night
and
was
then
devoured
by
the
demon
now
it
happened
by
great
good
luck
that
a
caravan
of
merchants
from
gujerat
halted
on
the
banks
of
a
river
not
far
from
the
city
they
were
attended
by
a
servant
who
was
no
other
than
vikramaditya
at
nightfall
the
jackals
began
to
howl
as
usual
and
one
of
them
said
in
his
own
tongue
in
two
hours
a
human
corpse
will
shortly
float
down
this
river
with
four
rubies
of
great
price
at
his
belt
and
a
turquois
ring
on
his
finger
he
who
will
give
me
that
corpse
to
devour
will
bear
sway
over
the
seven
vikramaditya
knowing
the
language
of
birds
and
beasts
understood
what
the
jackal
said
gave
the
corpse
to
the
beast
to
devour
and
took
possession
of
the
ring
and
the
rubies
next
day
he
entered
the
town
and
traversing
the
streets
observed
a
troop
of
horse
under
arms
forming
a
royal
escort
at
the
door
of
a
potter
s
house
the
grandees
of
the
city
were
there
and
with
them
was
the
garrison
they
were
in
the
act
of
inducing
the
son
of
the
potter
to
mount
an
elephant
and
proceed
in
state
to
the
palace
but
strange
to
say
instead
of
being
pleased
at
the
honour
conferred
on
their
son
the
potter
and
his
wife
stood
on
the
threshold
weeping
and
sobbing
most
bitterly
learning
how
things
stood
the
chivalrous
vikramaditya
was
touched
with
pity
and
offered
to
accept
the
fatal
sovereignty
instead
of
the
potter
s
son
saying
that
he
would
either
deliver
the
people
from
the
tyranny
of
the
demon
or
perish
in
the
attempt
accordingly
he
donned
the
kingly
robes
assumed
all
the
badges
of
sovereignty
and
mounting
the
elephant
rode
in
great
pomp
to
the
palace
where
he
seated
himself
on
the
throne
while
the
dignitaries
of
the
kingdom
discharged
their
duties
in
his
presence
at
night
the
fiend
arrived
as
usual
to
eat
him
up
but
vikramaditya
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
and
after
a
terrific
combat
the
fiend
capitulated
and
agreed
to
quit
the
city
next
morning
the
people
on
coming
to
the
palace
were
astonished
to
find
vikramaditya
still
alive
they
thought
he
must
be
no
common
mortal
but
some
superhuman
being
or
the
descendant
of
a
great
king
grateful
to
him
for
their
deliverance
they
bestowed
the
kingdom
on
him
and
he
reigned
happily
over
them
according
to
one
account
the
dreadful
being
who
ravaged
ujjain
and
devoured
a
king
every
day
was
the
bloodthirsty
goddess
kali
when
she
quitted
the
city
she
left
behind
her
two
sisters
whose
quaint
images
still
frown
on
the
spectator
from
the
pillared
portal
known
as
vikramaditya
s
gate
at
ujjain
to
these
her
sisters
she
granted
the
privilege
of
devouring
as
many
human
beings
as
they
pleased
once
every
twelve
years
that
tribute
they
still
exact
though
the
european
in
his
blindness
attributes
the
deaths
to
cholera
but
in
addition
seven
girls
and
five
buffaloes
were
to
be
sacrificed
to
them
every
year
and
these
sacrifices
used
to
be
offered
regularly
until
the
practice
was
put
down
by
the
english
government
it
is
said
that
the
men
who
gave
their
daughters
to
be
slain
received
grants
of
land
as
a
reward
of
their
piety
nowadays
only
buffaloes
are
killed
at
the
daçaratha
festival
which
is
held
in
october
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
açvina
the
heads
of
the
animals
are
buried
at
vikramaditya
s
gateway
and
those
of
the
last
year
s
victims
are
taken
up
the
girls
who
would
formerly
have
been
sacrificed
are
now
released
but
they
are
not
allowed
to
marry
and
their
fathers
still
receive
grants
of
lands
just
as
if
the
cruel
sacrifice
had
been
consummated
the
persistence
of
these
bloody
rites
at
ujjain
down
to
recent
times
raises
a
presumption
that
the
tradition
of
the
daily
sacrifice
of
a
king
in
the
same
city
was
not
purely
mythical
it
is
worth
while
to
consider
another
of
the
stories
which
are
told
of
king
vikramaditya
his
birth
is
said
to
have
been
miraculous
for
his
father
was
who
was
the
son
of
the
great
god
indra
one
day
had
the
misfortune
to
offend
his
divine
father
who
was
so
angry
that
he
cursed
his
son
and
banished
him
from
heaven
to
earth
there
to
remain
under
the
form
of
an
ass
by
day
and
of
a
man
by
night
until
a
powerful
king
should
burn
his
ass
s
body
after
which
would
regain
his
proper
shape
and
return
to
the
upper
world
all
this
happened
according
to
the
divine
word
in
the
shape
of
an
ass
the
son
of
the
god
rendered
an
important
service
to
the
king
of
dhara
and
received
the
hand
of
the
king
s
daughter
as
his
reward
by
day
he
was
an
ass
and
ate
hay
in
the
stables
by
night
he
was
a
man
and
enjoyed
the
company
of
the
princess
his
wife
but
the
king
grew
tired
of
the
taunts
of
his
enemies
as
well
as
of
the
gibes
which
were
levelled
by
unfeeling
wits
at
his
asinine
so
one
night
while
in
human
shape
was
with
his
wife
the
king
got
hold
of
the
ass
s
body
which
his
had
temporarily
quitted
and
throwing
it
on
a
fire
burned
it
to
ashes
on
the
instant
appeared
to
him
and
thanking
him
for
undoing
the
spell
announced
that
he
was
about
to
return
to
heaven
but
that
his
wife
was
with
child
by
him
and
that
she
would
bring
forth
a
son
who
would
bear
the
name
of
vikramaditya
and
be
endowed
with
the
strength
of
a
thousand
elephants
the
deserted
wife
was
filled
with
sorrow
at
his
departure
and
died
in
giving
birth
to
vikramaditya
this
story
belongs
to
a
widely
diffused
type
of
tale
which
in
england
is
known
by
the
name
of
beauty
and
the
beast
it
relates
how
a
beast
doffing
its
animal
shape
lives
as
a
human
husband
or
wife
with
a
human
spouse
often
though
not
always
their
marriage
has
a
tragic
ending
the
couple
live
lovingly
together
for
years
and
children
are
born
to
them
but
it
is
a
condition
of
their
union
that
the
transformed
husband
or
wife
should
never
be
reminded
of
his
or
her
old
life
in
furry
feathered
or
finny
form
at
last
one
unhappy
day
the
fairy
spouse
finds
his
or
her
beast
skin
which
had
been
carefully
hidden
away
by
her
or
his
loving
partner
or
husband
and
wife
quarrel
and
the
real
man
or
woman
taunts
the
other
with
her
or
his
kinship
with
the
beasts
the
sight
of
the
once
familiar
skin
awakens
old
memories
and
stirs
yearnings
that
had
been
long
suppressed
the
cruel
words
undo
the
kindness
of
years
the
sometime
animal
resumes
its
native
shape
and
disappears
and
the
human
husband
or
wife
is
left
lamenting
sometimes
as
in
the
story
of
the
destruction
of
the
beast
s
skin
causes
the
fairy
mate
to
vanish
for
ever
sometimes
it
enables
him
or
her
to
remain
thenceforth
in
human
form
with
the
human
wife
or
husband
tales
of
this
sort
are
told
by
savages
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
many
of
them
have
survived
in
the
of
civilised
peoples
with
their
implied
belief
that
beasts
can
turn
into
men
or
men
into
beasts
they
must
clearly
have
originated
among
savages
who
see
nothing
incredible
in
such
transformations
now
it
is
to
be
observed
that
stories
of
this
sort
are
told
by
savage
tribes
to
explain
why
they
abstain
from
eating
certain
creatures
the
reason
they
assign
for
the
abstinence
is
that
they
themselves
are
descended
from
a
creature
of
that
sort
who
was
changed
for
a
time
into
human
shape
and
married
a
human
husband
or
wife
thus
in
the
rivers
of
sarawak
there
is
a
certain
fish
called
a
which
some
of
the
dyaks
will
on
no
account
eat
saying
that
if
they
did
so
they
would
be
eating
their
relations
tradition
runs
that
a
solitary
old
man
went
out
fishing
and
caught
a
which
he
dragged
out
of
the
water
and
laid
down
in
his
boat
on
turning
round
he
perceived
that
it
had
changed
into
a
very
pretty
girl
he
thought
she
would
make
a
charming
wife
for
his
son
so
he
took
her
home
and
brought
her
up
till
she
was
of
an
age
to
marry
she
consented
to
be
his
son
s
wife
but
cautioned
her
husband
to
use
her
well
some
time
after
marriage
however
he
was
angry
and
struck
her
she
screamed
and
rushed
away
into
the
water
leaving
behind
her
a
beautiful
daughter
who
became
the
mother
of
the
race
other
dyak
tribes
tell
similar
stories
of
their
ancestors
thus
the
sea
dyaks
relate
how
the
hawk
married
a
sea
dyak
woman
and
how
he
gave
all
his
daughters
in
marriage
to
the
various
hence
if
a
sea
dyak
kills
an
by
mistake
he
wraps
it
in
a
cloth
and
buries
it
carefully
in
the
earth
along
with
rice
flesh
and
money
entreating
the
bird
not
to
be
vexed
and
to
forgive
him
because
it
was
all
an
accident
again
a
kalamantan
chief
and
all
his
people
refrain
from
killing
and
eating
deer
of
a
certain
species
because
one
of
their
ancestors
became
a
deer
of
that
kind
and
as
they
can
not
distinguish
his
incarnation
from
common
deer
they
spare
them
all
in
these
latter
cases
the
legends
explaining
the
kinship
of
the
men
with
the
animals
are
not
given
in
full
we
can
only
conjecture
therefore
that
they
conform
to
the
type
here
discussed
the
sea
dyaks
also
tell
a
story
of
the
same
sort
to
explain
how
they
first
came
to
plant
rice
and
to
revere
the
which
play
so
important
a
part
in
dyak
life
long
long
ago
so
runs
the
tale
when
rice
was
yet
unknown
and
the
dyaks
lived
on
tapioca
yams
potatoes
and
such
fruits
as
they
could
procure
a
handsome
young
chief
named
siu
went
out
into
the
forest
with
his
to
shoot
birds
he
wandered
without
seeing
a
bird
or
meeting
an
animal
till
the
sun
was
sinking
in
the
west
then
he
came
to
a
wild
covered
with
ripe
fruit
which
a
swarm
of
birds
of
all
kinds
were
busy
pecking
at
never
in
his
life
had
he
seen
so
many
birds
together
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
fowls
of
the
forest
were
gathered
in
the
boughs
of
that
tree
he
killed
a
great
many
with
the
poisoned
darts
of
his
and
putting
them
in
his
basket
started
for
home
but
he
lost
his
way
in
the
wood
and
the
night
had
fallen
before
he
saw
the
lights
and
heard
the
usual
sounds
of
a
dyak
house
hiding
his
and
the
dead
birds
in
the
jungle
he
went
up
the
ladder
into
the
house
but
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
it
apparently
deserted
there
was
no
one
in
the
long
verandah
and
of
the
people
whose
voices
he
had
heard
a
minute
before
not
one
was
to
be
seen
only
in
one
of
the
many
rooms
dimly
lighted
he
found
a
beautiful
girl
who
prepared
for
him
his
evening
meal
now
though
siu
did
not
know
it
the
house
was
the
house
of
the
great
singalang
burong
the
ruler
of
the
spirit
world
he
could
turn
himself
and
his
followers
into
any
shape
when
they
went
forth
against
an
enemy
they
took
the
form
of
birds
for
the
sake
of
speed
and
flew
over
the
tall
trees
the
broad
rivers
and
even
the
sea
but
in
his
own
house
and
among
his
own
people
singalang
burong
appeared
as
a
man
he
had
eight
daughters
and
the
girl
who
cooked
siu
s
food
for
him
was
the
youngest
the
reason
why
the
house
was
so
still
and
deserted
was
that
the
people
were
in
mourning
for
some
of
their
relatives
who
had
just
been
killed
and
the
men
had
gone
out
to
take
human
heads
in
revenge
siu
stayed
in
the
house
for
a
week
and
then
the
girl
whose
pet
name
was
bunsu
burong
or
the
youngest
of
the
bird
family
agreed
to
marry
him
but
she
said
he
must
promise
never
to
kill
or
hurt
a
bird
or
even
to
hold
one
in
his
hands
for
if
he
did
she
would
be
his
wife
no
more
siu
promised
and
together
they
returned
to
his
people
there
they
lived
happily
and
in
time
siu
s
wife
bore
him
a
son
whom
they
named
seragunting
one
day
when
the
boy
had
grown
wonderfully
tall
and
strong
for
his
years
and
was
playing
with
his
fellows
a
man
brought
some
birds
which
he
had
caught
in
a
trap
forgetting
the
promise
he
had
made
to
his
wife
siu
asked
the
man
to
shew
him
the
birds
and
taking
one
of
them
in
his
hand
he
stroked
it
his
wife
saw
it
and
was
sad
at
heart
she
took
the
pitchers
and
went
as
though
she
would
fetch
water
from
the
well
but
she
never
came
back
siu
and
his
son
sought
her
sorrowing
for
days
at
last
after
many
adventures
they
came
to
the
house
of
the
boy
s
grandfather
singalang
burong
the
ruler
of
the
spirit
world
there
they
found
the
lost
wife
and
mother
and
there
they
stayed
for
a
time
but
the
heart
of
siu
yearned
to
his
old
home
he
would
fain
have
persuaded
his
wife
to
return
with
him
but
she
would
not
so
at
last
he
and
his
son
went
back
alone
but
before
he
went
he
learned
from
his
how
to
plant
rice
and
how
to
revere
the
sacred
birds
and
to
draw
omens
from
them
these
birds
were
named
after
the
of
the
ruler
of
the
spirit
world
and
were
the
appointed
means
whereby
he
made
known
his
wishes
to
mankind
that
is
how
the
sea
dyaks
learned
to
plant
rice
and
to
honour
the
stories
of
the
same
kind
meet
us
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
thus
the
negroes
of
the
gold
coast
are
divided
into
a
number
of
great
families
or
clans
mostly
named
after
animals
or
plants
and
the
members
of
a
clan
refrain
from
eating
animals
of
the
species
whose
name
they
bear
in
short
the
various
animals
or
plants
are
the
totems
of
their
respective
clans
now
some
of
the
more
recent
of
these
clans
possess
traditions
of
their
origin
and
in
such
cases
the
founder
of
the
family
from
whom
the
name
is
derived
is
always
represented
as
having
been
a
beast
bird
or
fish
which
possessed
the
power
of
assuming
human
shape
at
will
thus
for
instance
at
the
town
of
chama
there
resides
a
family
or
clan
who
take
their
name
from
the
or
which
they
may
not
eat
because
they
are
descended
from
a
one
day
so
runs
the
story
a
native
of
chama
who
had
lost
his
wife
was
walking
sadly
on
the
beach
when
he
met
a
beautiful
young
woman
whom
he
persuaded
to
be
his
wife
she
consented
but
told
him
that
her
home
lay
in
the
sea
that
her
people
were
fishes
and
that
she
herself
was
a
fish
and
she
made
him
swear
that
he
would
never
allude
to
her
old
home
and
kinsfolk
all
went
well
for
a
time
till
her
husband
took
a
second
wife
who
quarrelled
with
the
first
wife
and
taunted
her
with
being
a
fish
that
grieved
her
so
that
she
bade
her
husband
and
plunged
into
the
sea
with
her
youngest
child
in
her
arms
but
she
left
her
two
elder
children
behind
and
from
them
are
descended
the
people
of
chama
a
similar
story
is
told
of
another
family
in
the
town
of
appam
their
ancestor
caught
a
fine
fish
of
the
sort
called
which
turned
into
a
beautiful
woman
and
became
his
wife
but
she
told
him
that
in
future
neither
they
nor
their
descendants
might
eat
the
fish
or
else
they
would
at
once
return
to
the
sea
the
family
duly
observing
the
prohibition
increased
and
multiplied
till
they
occupied
the
whole
country
which
was
named
after
them
appeim
or
appam
we
may
surmise
that
stories
of
this
sort
wherever
found
had
a
similar
origin
in
other
words
that
they
reflect
and
are
intended
to
explain
a
real
belief
in
the
kinship
of
certain
families
with
certain
species
of
animals
hence
if
the
name
totemism
may
be
used
to
include
all
such
beliefs
and
the
practices
based
on
them
the
origin
of
this
type
of
story
may
be
said
to
be
totemic
now
wherever
the
totemic
clans
have
become
exogamous
that
is
wherever
a
man
is
always
obliged
to
marry
a
woman
of
a
totem
different
from
his
own
it
is
obvious
that
husband
and
wife
will
always
have
to
observe
different
totemic
taboos
and
that
a
want
of
respect
shewn
by
one
of
them
for
the
sacred
animal
or
plant
of
the
other
would
tend
to
domestic
jars
which
might
often
lead
to
the
permanent
separation
of
the
spouses
the
offended
wife
or
husband
returning
to
her
or
his
native
clan
of
the
the
or
what
not
that
i
take
it
was
the
origin
of
the
sad
story
of
the
man
or
woman
happily
mated
with
a
transformed
animal
and
then
parted
for
ever
such
tales
if
i
am
right
were
not
wholly
fictitious
totemism
may
have
broken
many
loving
hearts
but
when
that
ancient
system
of
society
had
fallen
into
disuse
and
the
ideas
on
which
it
was
based
had
ceased
to
be
understood
the
quaint
stories
of
mixed
marriages
to
which
it
had
given
birth
would
not
be
at
once
forgotten
they
would
continue
to
be
told
no
longer
indeed
as
myths
explanatory
of
custom
but
merely
as
fairy
tales
for
the
amusement
of
the
listeners
the
barbarous
features
of
the
old
legends
which
now
appeared
too
monstrously
incredible
even
for
would
be
gradually
discarded
and
replaced
by
others
which
fitted
in
better
with
the
changed
beliefs
of
the
time
thus
in
particular
the
animal
husband
or
animal
wife
of
the
story
might
drop
the
character
of
a
beast
to
assume
that
of
a
fairy
this
is
the
stage
of
decay
exhibited
by
the
two
most
famous
tales
of
the
class
in
question
the
greek
fable
of
cupid
and
psyche
and
the
indian
story
of
king
pururavas
and
the
nymph
urvasi
though
in
the
latter
we
can
still
detect
hints
that
the
fairy
wife
was
once
a
it
would
no
doubt
be
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
totemism
or
a
system
of
taboos
resembling
it
must
have
existed
wherever
such
stories
are
told
for
it
is
certain
that
popular
tales
spread
by
diffusion
from
tribe
to
tribe
and
nation
to
nation
till
they
may
be
handed
down
by
oral
tradition
among
people
who
neither
practise
nor
even
understand
the
customs
in
which
the
stories
originated
yet
the
legend
of
the
miraculous
parentage
of
vikramaditya
may
very
well
have
been
based
on
the
existence
at
ujjain
of
a
line
of
rajahs
who
had
the
ass
for
their
crest
or
totem
such
a
custom
is
not
without
analogy
in
india
the
crest
of
the
maharajah
of
nagpur
is
a
cobra
with
a
human
face
under
its
expanded
hood
surrounded
by
all
the
insignia
of
royalty
moreover
the
rajah
and
the
chief
members
of
his
family
always
wear
turbans
so
arranged
that
they
resemble
a
coiled
serpent
with
its
head
projecting
over
the
wearer
s
brow
to
explain
this
serpent
badge
a
tale
is
told
which
conforms
to
the
type
of
beauty
and
the
beast
once
upon
a
time
a
nag
or
serpent
named
pundarika
took
upon
himself
the
likeness
of
a
brahman
and
repaired
in
that
guise
to
the
house
of
a
real
brahman
at
benares
in
order
to
perfect
himself
in
a
knowledge
of
the
sacred
books
the
teacher
was
so
pleased
with
the
progress
made
by
his
pupil
that
he
gave
him
his
only
child
the
beautiful
parvati
to
wife
but
the
subtle
serpent
though
he
could
assume
any
form
at
pleasure
was
unable
to
rid
himself
of
his
forked
tongue
and
foul
breath
to
conceal
these
personal
blemishes
from
his
wife
he
always
slept
with
his
back
to
her
one
night
however
she
got
round
him
and
discovered
his
unpleasant
peculiarities
she
questioned
him
sharply
and
to
divert
her
attention
he
proposed
that
they
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
juggernaut
the
idea
of
visiting
that
fashionable
so
raised
the
lady
s
spirits
that
she
quite
forgot
to
pursue
the
enquiry
however
on
their
way
home
her
curiosity
revived
and
she
repeated
her
questions
under
circumstances
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
serpent
as
a
tender
husband
to
evade
them
though
well
he
knew
that
the
disclosure
he
was
about
to
make
would
sever
him
the
immortal
at
once
and
for
ever
from
his
mortal
wife
he
related
the
wondrous
tale
and
plunging
into
a
pool
disappeared
from
sight
his
poor
wife
was
inconsolable
at
his
hurried
departure
and
in
the
midst
of
her
grief
and
remorse
her
child
was
born
but
instead
of
rejoicing
at
the
birth
she
made
for
herself
a
funeral
pyre
and
perished
in
the
flames
at
that
moment
a
brahman
appeared
on
the
scene
and
perceived
the
forsaken
babe
lying
sheltered
and
guarded
by
a
great
hooded
snake
it
was
the
serpent
father
protecting
his
child
addressing
the
brahman
he
narrated
his
history
and
foretold
that
the
child
should
be
called
raya
that
is
the
snake
crowned
and
that
he
should
reign
as
rajah
over
the
country
to
be
called
nagpur
that
is
why
the
rajahs
of
nagpur
have
the
serpent
for
their
crest
again
the
rajahs
of
manipur
trace
their
descent
from
a
divine
snake
at
his
installation
a
rajah
of
manipur
used
to
have
to
pass
with
great
solemnity
between
two
massive
dragons
of
stone
which
stood
in
front
of
the
coronation
house
somewhere
inside
the
building
was
a
mysterious
chamber
and
in
the
chamber
was
a
pipe
which
according
to
the
popular
belief
led
down
to
the
depths
of
a
cavern
where
dwells
the
snake
god
the
ancestor
of
the
royal
family
the
length
and
prosperity
of
the
rajah
s
reign
were
believed
to
depend
on
the
length
of
time
he
could
sit
on
the
pipe
enduring
the
fiery
breath
of
his
serpentine
forefather
in
the
place
below
women
are
specially
devoted
to
the
worship
of
the
ancestral
snake
and
great
reverence
is
paid
them
in
virtue
of
their
sacred
office
the
parallelism
between
the
legends
of
nagpur
and
ujjain
may
be
allowed
to
strengthen
my
conjecture
that
if
we
have
a
race
of
royal
serpents
in
the
one
place
there
may
well
have
been
a
race
of
royal
asses
in
the
other
indeed
such
dynasties
have
perhaps
not
been
so
rare
as
might
be
supposed
chapter
iv
the
supply
of
kings
tales
of
the
foregoing
sort
might
be
dismissed
as
fictions
designed
to
amuse
a
leisure
hour
were
it
not
for
their
remarkable
agreement
with
beliefs
and
customs
which
as
we
have
seen
still
exist
or
are
known
to
have
existed
in
former
times
that
agreement
can
hardly
be
accidental
we
seem
to
be
justified
therefore
in
assuming
that
stories
of
the
kind
really
rest
on
a
basis
of
facts
however
much
these
facts
may
have
been
distorted
or
magnified
in
passing
through
the
mind
of
the
who
is
naturally
more
concerned
to
amuse
than
instruct
his
hearers
even
the
legend
of
a
line
of
kings
of
whom
each
reigned
for
a
single
day
and
was
sacrificed
at
night
for
the
good
of
the
people
will
hardly
seem
incredible
when
we
remember
that
to
this
day
a
kingdom
is
held
on
a
similar
tenure
in
west
africa
though
under
modern
conditions
the
throne
stands
vacant
and
while
it
would
be
vain
to
rely
on
such
stories
for
exact
historical
details
yet
they
may
help
us
in
a
general
way
to
understand
the
practical
working
of
an
institution
which
to
civilised
men
seems
at
first
sight
to
belong
to
the
cloudland
of
fancy
rather
than
to
the
sober
reality
of
the
workaday
world
remark
for
example
how
in
these
stories
the
supply
of
kings
is
maintained
in
the
indian
tradition
all
the
men
of
the
city
are
put
on
a
list
and
each
of
them
when
his
turn
comes
is
forced
to
reign
for
a
day
and
to
die
the
death
it
is
not
left
to
his
choice
to
decide
whether
he
will
accept
the
fatal
sovereignty
or
not
in
the
history
of
the
holy
the
mode
of
filling
the
vacant
throne
is
different
a
stranger
not
a
citizen
is
seized
and
compelled
to
accept
office
in
the
end
no
doubt
the
dwarf
volunteers
to
be
king
thus
saving
lancelot
s
life
but
the
narrative
plainly
implies
that
if
a
substitute
had
not
thus
been
found
lancelot
would
have
been
obliged
whether
he
would
or
not
to
wear
the
crown
and
to
perish
in
the
fire
in
thus
representing
the
succession
to
a
throne
as
compulsory
the
stories
may
well
preserve
a
reminiscence
of
a
real
custom
to
us
indeed
who
draw
our
ideas
of
kingship
from
the
hereditary
and
highly
privileged
monarchies
of
civilised
europe
the
notion
of
thrusting
the
crown
upon
reluctant
strangers
or
common
citizens
of
the
lowest
rank
is
apt
to
appear
fantastic
and
absurd
but
that
is
merely
because
we
fail
to
realise
how
widely
the
modern
type
of
kingship
has
diverged
from
the
ancient
pattern
in
early
times
the
duties
of
sovereignty
are
more
conspicuous
than
its
privileges
at
a
certain
stage
of
development
the
chief
or
king
is
rather
the
minister
or
servant
than
the
ruler
of
his
people
the
sacred
functions
which
he
is
expected
to
discharge
are
deemed
essential
to
the
welfare
and
even
the
existence
of
the
community
and
at
any
cost
some
one
must
be
found
to
perform
them
yet
the
burdens
and
restrictions
of
all
sorts
incidental
to
the
early
kingship
are
such
that
not
merely
in
popular
tales
but
in
actual
practice
compulsion
has
sometimes
been
found
necessary
to
fill
vacancies
while
elsewhere
the
lack
of
candidates
has
caused
the
office
to
fall
into
abeyance
or
even
to
be
abolished
altogether
and
where
death
stared
the
luckless
monarch
in
the
face
at
the
end
of
a
brief
reign
of
a
few
months
or
days
we
need
not
wonder
that
gaols
had
to
be
swept
and
the
dregs
of
society
raked
to
find
a
king
yet
we
should
doubtless
err
if
we
supposed
that
under
such
hard
conditions
men
could
never
be
found
ready
and
even
eager
to
accept
the
sovereignty
a
variety
of
causes
has
led
the
modern
nations
of
western
europe
to
set
on
human
own
life
and
that
of
higher
value
than
is
put
upon
it
by
many
other
races
the
result
is
a
fear
of
death
which
is
certainly
not
shared
in
the
same
degree
of
intensity
by
some
peoples
whom
we
in
our
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
our
inferiors
among
the
causes
which
thus
tend
to
make
us
cowards
may
be
numbered
the
spread
of
luxury
and
the
doctrines
of
a
gloomy
theology
which
by
proclaiming
the
eternal
damnation
and
excruciating
torments
of
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
has
added
incalculably
to
the
dread
and
horror
of
death
the
growth
of
humaner
sentiments
which
seldom
fails
to
effect
a
corresponding
amelioration
in
the
character
even
of
the
gods
has
indeed
led
many
protestant
divines
of
late
years
to
temper
the
rigour
of
the
divine
justice
with
a
large
infusion
of
mercy
by
relegating
the
fires
of
hell
to
a
decent
obscurity
or
even
extinguishing
them
altogether
but
these
lurid
flames
appear
to
blaze
as
fiercely
as
ever
in
the
more
conservative
theology
of
the
catholic
church
it
would
be
easy
to
accumulate
evidence
of
the
indifference
or
apathy
exhibited
in
presence
of
death
by
races
whom
we
commonly
brand
as
lower
a
few
examples
must
here
suffice
speaking
of
the
natives
of
india
an
english
writer
observes
we
place
the
highest
value
on
life
while
they
being
blessed
with
a
comfortable
fatalism
which
assumes
that
each
man
s
destiny
is
written
on
his
forehead
in
invisible
characters
and
being
besides
untroubled
with
any
doubts
or
thoughts
as
to
the
nature
of
their
reception
in
the
next
world
take
matters
of
life
and
death
a
great
deal
more
unconcernedly
and
compared
with
our
ideas
they
may
be
said
to
present
an
almost
apathetic
indifference
on
these
to
the
same
effect
another
english
writer
remarks
that
the
absence
of
that
fear
of
death
which
is
so
powerful
in
the
hearts
of
civilised
men
is
the
most
remarkable
trait
in
the
hindu
among
the
natives
of
annam
according
to
a
catholic
missionary
the
subject
of
death
has
nothing
alarming
for
anybody
in
presence
of
a
sick
man
people
will
speak
of
his
approaching
end
and
of
his
funeral
as
readily
as
of
anything
else
hence
we
never
need
to
take
the
least
verbal
precaution
in
warning
the
sick
to
prepare
themselves
to
receive
the
last
sacraments
some
time
ago
i
was
summoned
to
a
neophyte
whose
death
though
certain
was
still
distant
on
entering
the
house
i
found
a
woman
seated
at
his
bedside
sewing
the
mourning
dresses
of
the
family
moreover
the
carpenter
was
fitting
together
the
boards
of
the
coffin
quite
close
to
the
door
of
the
house
so
that
the
dying
man
could
observe
the
whole
proceeding
from
his
bed
the
worthy
man
superintended
personally
all
these
details
and
gave
directions
for
each
of
the
operations
he
even
had
for
his
pillow
part
of
the
mourning
costume
which
was
already
finished
i
could
tell
you
a
host
of
anecdotes
of
the
same
among
these
people
it
is
a
mark
of
filial
piety
to
present
a
father
or
mother
with
a
coffin
the
presentation
is
the
occasion
of
a
family
festival
to
which
all
friends
are
invited
pupils
display
their
respect
for
their
masters
in
the
same
fashion
bishop
masson
whose
letter
i
have
just
quoted
was
himself
presented
with
a
fine
coffin
by
some
of
his
converts
as
a
new
year
gift
and
a
token
of
their
respect
and
affection
they
invited
his
attention
particularly
to
the
quality
of
the
wood
and
the
beauty
of
the
workmanship
with
regard
to
the
north
american
indians
a
writer
who
knew
them
well
has
said
that
among
them
the
idea
of
immortality
is
strongly
dwelt
upon
it
is
not
spoken
of
as
a
supposition
or
a
mere
belief
not
fixed
it
is
regarded
as
an
actuality
something
known
and
approved
by
the
judgment
of
the
nation
during
the
whole
period
of
my
residence
and
travels
in
the
indian
country
i
never
knew
and
never
heard
of
an
indian
who
did
not
believe
in
it
and
in
the
reappearance
of
the
body
in
a
future
state
however
mistaken
they
are
on
the
subject
of
accountabilities
for
acts
done
in
the
present
life
no
small
part
of
their
entire
mythology
and
the
belief
that
sustains
the
man
in
his
vicissitudes
and
wanderings
here
arises
from
the
anticipation
of
ease
and
enjoyment
in
a
future
condition
after
the
soul
has
left
the
body
the
resignation
nay
the
alacrity
with
which
an
indian
frequently
lies
down
and
surrenders
life
is
to
be
ascribed
to
this
prevalent
belief
he
does
not
fear
to
go
to
a
land
which
all
his
life
long
he
has
heard
abounds
in
rewards
without
another
traveller
who
saw
much
of
the
south
american
indians
asserts
that
they
surpass
the
beasts
in
their
insensibility
to
hardship
and
pain
never
complaining
in
sickness
nor
even
when
they
are
being
killed
and
exhibiting
in
their
last
moments
an
apathetic
indifference
untroubled
by
any
misgiving
as
to
the
future
wholesale
butcheries
of
human
beings
were
perpetrated
till
lately
in
the
name
of
religion
in
the
west
african
kingdom
of
dahomey
as
to
the
behaviour
of
the
victims
we
are
told
that
almost
invariably
those
doomed
to
die
exhibit
the
greatest
coolness
and
unconcern
the
natural
dread
of
death
which
the
instinct
of
has
implanted
in
every
breast
often
leads
persons
who
are
liable
to
be
seized
for
immolation
to
endeavour
to
escape
but
once
they
are
seized
and
bound
they
resign
themselves
to
their
fate
with
the
greatest
apathy
this
is
partly
due
to
the
less
delicate
nervous
system
of
the
negro
but
one
reason
and
that
not
the
least
is
that
they
have
nothing
to
fear
as
has
been
said
they
have
but
to
undergo
a
surgical
operation
and
a
change
of
place
of
residence
there
is
no
uncertain
future
to
be
faced
and
above
all
there
is
an
entire
absence
of
that
notion
of
a
place
of
terrible
punishment
which
makes
so
many
europeans
cowards
when
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
earliest
european
settlers
on
the
coast
of
brazil
has
remarked
on
the
indifference
exhibited
by
the
indian
prisoners
who
were
about
to
be
massacred
by
their
enemies
he
conversed
with
the
captives
men
young
strong
and
handsome
to
his
question
whether
they
did
not
fear
the
death
that
was
so
near
and
so
appalling
they
replied
with
laughter
and
mockery
when
he
spoke
of
ransoming
them
from
their
foes
they
jeered
at
the
cowardice
of
europeans
the
khonds
of
india
practised
an
extensive
system
of
human
sacrifice
of
which
we
shall
hear
more
in
the
sequel
the
victims
known
as
meriahs
were
kept
for
years
to
be
sacrificed
and
their
manner
of
death
was
peculiarly
horrible
since
they
were
hacked
to
pieces
or
slowly
roasted
alive
yet
when
these
destined
victims
were
rescued
by
the
english
officers
who
were
engaged
in
putting
down
the
custom
they
generally
availed
themselves
of
any
opportunity
to
escape
from
their
deliverers
and
returned
to
their
fate
in
uganda
there
were
formerly
many
sacrificial
places
where
human
victims
used
to
be
slaughtered
or
burned
to
death
sometimes
in
hundreds
from
motives
of
superstition
those
who
have
taken
part
in
these
executions
bear
witness
how
seldom
a
victim
whether
man
or
woman
raised
his
voice
to
protest
or
appeal
against
the
treatment
meted
out
to
him
the
victims
went
to
death
so
they
thought
to
save
their
country
and
race
from
some
calamity
and
they
laid
down
their
lives
without
a
murmur
or
a
but
it
is
not
merely
that
men
of
other
races
and
other
religions
submit
to
inevitable
death
with
an
equanimity
which
modern
europeans
in
general
can
not
match
they
often
actually
seek
and
find
it
for
reasons
which
seem
to
us
wholly
inadequate
the
motives
which
lead
them
to
sacrifice
their
lives
are
very
various
among
them
religious
fanaticism
has
probably
been
one
of
the
commonest
and
in
the
preceding
pages
we
have
met
with
many
instances
of
voluntary
deaths
incurred
under
its
powerful
impulse
but
more
secular
motives
such
as
loyalty
revenge
and
an
excessive
sensibility
on
the
point
of
honour
have
also
driven
multitudes
to
throw
away
their
lives
with
a
levity
which
may
strike
the
average
modern
englishman
as
bordering
on
insanity
it
may
be
well
to
illustrate
this
comparative
indifference
to
death
by
a
few
miscellaneous
examples
drawn
from
different
races
thus
when
the
king
of
benin
died
and
was
about
to
be
lowered
into
the
earth
his
favourites
and
servants
used
to
compete
with
each
other
for
the
privilege
of
being
buried
alive
with
his
body
in
order
that
they
might
attend
and
minister
to
him
in
the
other
world
after
the
dispute
was
settled
and
the
tomb
had
closed
over
the
dead
and
the
living
sentinels
were
set
to
watch
it
day
and
night
next
day
the
sepulchre
would
be
opened
and
some
one
would
call
down
to
the
entombed
men
to
know
what
they
were
doing
and
whether
any
of
them
had
gone
to
serve
the
king
the
answer
was
commonly
no
not
the
third
day
the
same
question
would
be
put
and
a
voice
would
reply
that
had
gone
to
join
his
majesty
the
first
to
die
was
deemed
the
happiest
in
four
or
five
days
when
no
answer
came
up
to
the
question
and
all
was
silent
in
the
grave
the
heir
to
the
throne
was
informed
and
he
signalised
his
accession
by
kindling
a
fire
on
the
tomb
roasting
flesh
at
it
and
distributing
the
meat
to
the
people
the
daughter
of
a
mbaya
chief
in
south
america
having
been
happily
baptized
at
the
very
point
of
death
was
accorded
christian
burial
in
the
church
by
the
jesuit
missionary
who
had
rescued
her
like
a
brand
from
the
burning
but
an
old
heathen
woman
of
the
tribe
took
it
sadly
to
heart
that
her
chief
s
daughter
should
not
be
honoured
with
the
usual
human
sacrifices
so
drawing
an
indian
aside
she
implored
him
to
be
so
kind
as
to
knock
her
on
the
head
that
she
might
go
and
serve
her
young
mistress
in
the
land
of
souls
the
savage
obligingly
complied
with
her
request
and
the
whole
horde
begged
the
missionary
that
her
body
might
be
buried
with
that
of
the
chief
s
daughter
the
jesuit
sternly
refused
he
informed
them
that
the
girl
was
now
with
the
angels
and
stood
in
need
of
no
such
attendant
as
for
the
old
woman
he
observed
grimly
that
she
had
gone
to
a
very
different
place
and
would
move
in
a
very
different
circle
of
society
when
otho
committed
suicide
after
the
battle
of
bedriacum
some
of
his
soldiers
slew
themselves
at
his
pyre
and
their
example
was
afterwards
followed
by
many
of
their
comrades
in
the
armies
which
had
marched
with
otho
to
meet
vitellius
their
motive
was
not
fear
of
the
conqueror
but
purely
loyalty
and
devotion
to
their
emperor
in
the
east
that
indifference
to
human
life
which
seems
so
strange
to
the
western
mind
often
takes
a
peculiar
form
a
man
will
sometimes
kill
himself
merely
in
order
to
be
revenged
on
his
foe
believing
that
his
ghost
will
haunt
and
torment
the
survivor
or
expecting
that
punishment
of
some
sort
will
overtake
the
wretch
who
drove
him
to
this
extreme
step
among
some
peoples
etiquette
requires
that
if
a
man
commits
suicide
for
this
purpose
his
enemy
should
at
once
follow
his
example
to
take
a
single
example
there
is
a
caste
of
robbers
in
southern
india
among
whom
the
law
of
retaliation
prevails
in
all
its
rigour
if
a
quarrel
takes
place
and
somebody
tears
out
his
own
eye
or
kills
himself
his
adversary
must
do
the
same
either
to
himself
or
to
one
of
his
relations
the
women
carry
this
barbarity
still
further
for
a
slight
affront
put
on
them
a
sharp
word
said
to
them
they
will
go
and
smash
their
head
against
the
door
of
her
who
offended
them
and
the
latter
is
obliged
immediately
to
do
the
same
if
a
woman
poisons
herself
by
drinking
the
juice
of
a
poisonous
herb
the
other
woman
who
drove
her
to
this
violent
death
must
poison
herself
likewise
else
her
house
will
be
burned
her
cattle
carried
off
and
injuries
of
all
kinds
done
her
until
satisfaction
is
given
they
extend
this
cruelty
even
to
their
own
children
not
long
ago
a
few
steps
from
the
church
in
which
i
have
the
honour
to
write
to
you
two
of
these
barbarians
having
quarrelled
one
of
them
ran
to
his
house
took
from
it
a
child
of
about
four
years
and
crushed
its
head
between
two
stones
in
the
presence
of
his
enemy
the
latter
without
exhibiting
any
emotion
took
his
old
daughter
and
plunging
a
dagger
into
her
breast
said
your
child
was
only
four
years
old
mine
was
nine
years
old
give
me
a
victim
to
equal
certainly
replied
the
other
and
seeing
at
his
side
his
eldest
son
who
was
ready
to
be
married
he
stabbed
him
four
or
five
times
with
his
dagger
and
not
content
with
shedding
the
blood
of
his
two
sons
he
killed
his
wife
too
in
order
to
oblige
his
enemy
to
murder
his
wife
in
like
manner
lastly
a
little
girl
and
a
baby
at
the
breast
had
also
their
throats
cut
so
that
in
a
single
day
seven
persons
were
sacrificed
to
the
vengeance
of
two
bloodthirsty
men
more
cruel
than
the
most
ferocious
brutes
i
have
actually
in
my
church
a
young
man
who
sought
refuge
among
us
wounded
by
a
which
his
father
inflicted
on
him
in
order
to
kill
him
and
thus
oblige
his
foe
to
slay
his
own
son
in
like
manner
the
barbarian
had
already
stabbed
two
of
his
children
on
other
occasions
for
the
same
purpose
such
atrocious
examples
will
seem
to
you
to
partake
more
of
fable
than
of
truth
but
believe
me
that
far
from
exaggerating
i
could
produce
many
others
not
less
the
same
contempt
of
death
which
many
races
have
exhibited
in
modern
times
was
displayed
in
antiquity
by
the
hardy
natives
of
europe
before
christianity
had
painted
the
world
beyond
the
grave
in
colours
at
which
even
their
bold
spirits
quailed
thus
for
example
at
their
banquets
the
rude
thracians
used
to
suspend
a
halter
over
a
movable
stone
and
cast
lots
among
themselves
the
man
on
whom
the
lot
fell
mounted
the
stone
with
a
scimitar
in
his
hand
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
noose
a
comrade
then
rolled
the
stone
from
under
him
and
while
he
did
so
the
other
attempted
to
sever
the
rope
with
his
scimitar
if
he
succeeded
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
was
saved
if
he
failed
he
was
hanged
and
his
dying
struggles
were
greeted
with
peals
of
laughter
by
his
fellows
who
regarded
the
whole
thing
as
a
capital
joke
the
greek
traveller
posidonius
who
visited
gaul
early
in
the
first
century
before
our
era
records
that
among
the
celts
men
were
to
be
found
who
for
a
sum
of
money
or
a
number
of
jars
of
wine
which
they
distributed
among
their
kinsmen
or
friends
would
allow
themselves
to
be
publicly
slaughtered
in
a
theatre
they
lay
down
on
their
backs
upon
a
shield
and
a
man
came
and
cut
their
throats
with
a
sword
a
greek
author
euphorion
of
chalcis
who
lived
in
the
age
when
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
were
turned
on
the
great
conflict
between
rome
and
carthage
for
the
mastery
of
the
mediterranean
tells
us
that
at
rome
it
was
customary
to
advertise
for
men
who
would
consent
to
be
beheaded
with
an
axe
in
consideration
of
receiving
a
sum
of
five
or
about
twenty
pounds
of
our
money
to
be
paid
after
their
death
to
their
heirs
apparently
there
was
no
lack
of
applicants
for
this
bounty
for
we
are
informed
that
several
candidates
would
often
compete
for
the
privilege
each
of
them
arguing
that
he
had
the
best
right
to
be
cudgelled
to
death
why
were
these
men
invited
to
be
beheaded
for
twenty
pounds
a
piece
and
why
in
response
to
the
invitation
did
they
gratuitously
as
it
would
seem
express
their
readiness
to
suffer
a
much
more
painful
death
than
simple
decapitation
the
reasons
are
not
stated
by
euphorion
in
the
brief
extract
quoted
from
his
work
by
athenaeus
the
greek
writer
who
has
also
preserved
for
us
the
testimony
of
posidonius
to
the
gallic
recklessness
of
life
but
the
connexion
in
which
athenaeus
cites
both
these
passages
suggests
that
the
intention
of
the
roman
as
of
the
gallic
practice
was
merely
to
minister
to
the
brutal
pleasure
of
the
spectators
for
he
inserts
his
account
of
the
customs
in
a
dissertation
on
banquets
and
he
had
just
before
described
how
hired
ruffians
fought
and
butchered
each
other
at
roman
for
the
amusement
of
the
tipsy
guests
or
perhaps
the
men
were
wanted
to
be
slaughtered
at
funerals
for
we
know
that
at
rome
a
custom
formerly
prevailed
of
sacrificing
human
beings
at
the
tomb
the
victims
were
commonly
captives
or
slaves
but
they
may
sometimes
have
been
obtained
by
advertisement
from
among
the
class
of
needy
freemen
such
wretches
in
bidding
against
each
other
may
have
pleaded
as
a
reason
for
giving
them
the
preference
that
they
really
deserved
for
their
crimes
to
die
a
slow
and
painful
death
under
the
cudgel
of
the
executioner
this
explanation
of
the
custom
which
i
owe
to
my
friend
wyse
is
perhaps
the
most
probable
but
it
is
also
possible
though
the
language
of
euphorion
does
not
lend
itself
so
well
to
this
interpretation
that
a
cudgelling
preceded
decapitation
as
part
of
the
bargain
if
that
was
so
it
would
seem
that
the
men
were
wanted
to
die
as
substitutes
for
condemned
criminals
for
in
old
rome
capital
punishment
was
regularly
inflicted
in
this
fashion
the
malefactors
being
tied
up
to
a
post
and
scourged
with
rods
before
they
were
beheaded
with
an
axe
there
is
nothing
improbable
in
the
view
that
persons
could
be
hired
to
suffer
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
instead
of
the
real
culprits
we
shall
see
that
a
voluntary
substitution
of
the
same
sort
is
reported
on
apparently
good
authority
to
be
still
occasionally
practised
in
china
however
it
is
immaterial
to
our
purpose
whether
these
men
perished
to
save
others
to
adorn
a
funeral
or
merely
to
gratify
the
roman
lust
for
blood
the
one
thing
that
concerns
us
is
that
in
the
great
age
of
rome
there
were
to
be
found
romans
willing
nay
eager
to
barter
their
lives
for
a
paltry
sum
of
money
of
which
they
were
not
even
to
have
the
enjoyment
no
wonder
that
men
made
of
that
stuff
founded
a
great
empire
and
spread
the
terror
of
the
roman
arms
from
the
grampians
to
the
tropics
the
comparative
indifference
with
which
the
chinese
regard
their
lives
is
attested
by
the
readiness
with
which
they
commit
suicide
on
grounds
which
often
seem
to
the
european
extremely
trifling
a
still
more
striking
proof
of
their
apathy
in
this
respect
is
furnished
by
the
readiness
with
which
in
china
a
man
can
be
induced
to
suffer
death
for
a
sum
of
money
to
be
paid
to
his
relatives
thus
for
example
one
of
the
most
wealthy
of
the
aboriginal
tribes
called
is
remarkable
for
the
practice
of
a
singular
and
revolting
religious
ceremony
the
people
possess
a
large
temple
in
which
is
an
idol
in
the
form
of
a
dog
they
resort
to
this
shrine
on
a
certain
day
every
year
to
worship
at
this
annual
religious
festival
it
is
i
believe
customary
for
the
wealthy
members
of
the
tribe
to
entertain
their
poorer
brethren
at
a
banquet
given
in
honour
of
one
who
has
agreed
for
a
sum
of
money
paid
to
his
family
to
allow
himself
to
be
offered
as
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
the
dog
idol
at
the
end
of
the
banquet
the
victim
having
drunk
wine
freely
is
put
to
death
before
the
idol
this
people
believe
that
were
they
to
neglect
this
rite
they
would
be
visited
with
pestilence
famine
or
the
further
it
is
said
that
in
china
a
man
condemned
to
death
can
procure
a
substitute
who
for
a
small
sum
will
voluntarily
consent
to
be
executed
in
his
stead
the
money
goes
to
the
substitute
s
kinsfolk
and
since
to
increase
the
family
prosperity
at
the
expense
of
personal
suffering
is
regarded
by
the
chinese
as
an
act
of
the
highest
virtue
there
is
reported
to
be
just
as
there
used
to
be
in
ancient
rome
quite
a
competition
among
the
candidates
for
death
such
a
substitution
is
even
recognised
by
the
chinese
authorities
except
in
the
case
of
certain
grave
crimes
as
for
instance
parricide
the
local
mandarin
is
probably
not
averse
to
the
arrangement
for
he
is
said
to
make
a
pecuniary
profit
by
the
transaction
engaging
a
substitute
for
a
less
sum
than
he
received
from
the
condemned
man
and
pocketing
the
difference
the
foregoing
evidence
may
suffice
to
convince
us
that
we
should
commit
a
grievous
error
were
we
to
judge
all
men
s
love
of
life
by
our
own
and
to
assume
that
others
can
not
hold
cheap
what
we
count
so
dear
we
shall
never
understand
the
long
course
of
human
history
if
we
persist
in
measuring
mankind
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
by
the
standard
perhaps
excellent
but
certainly
narrow
of
the
modern
english
middle
class
with
their
love
of
material
comfort
and
their
passionate
absorbing
almost
bloodthirsty
clinging
to
that
class
of
which
i
may
say
in
the
words
of
matthew
arnold
that
i
am
myself
a
feeble
unit
doubtless
possesses
many
estimable
qualities
but
among
them
can
hardly
be
reckoned
the
rare
and
delicate
gift
of
historical
imagination
the
power
of
entering
into
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
men
of
other
ages
and
other
countries
of
conceiving
that
they
may
regulate
their
life
by
principles
which
do
not
square
with
ours
and
may
throw
it
away
for
objects
which
to
us
might
seem
ridiculously
inadequate
to
return
therefore
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
we
may
safely
assume
that
in
some
races
and
at
some
periods
of
history
though
certainly
not
in
the
classes
of
england
it
might
be
easy
to
find
men
who
would
willingly
accept
a
kingdom
with
the
certainty
of
being
put
to
death
after
a
reign
of
a
year
or
less
where
men
are
ready
as
they
have
been
in
gaul
in
rome
and
in
china
to
yield
up
their
lives
at
once
for
a
paltry
sum
of
which
they
are
themselves
to
reap
no
benefit
would
they
not
be
willing
to
purchase
at
the
same
price
a
year
s
tenure
of
a
throne
among
people
of
that
sort
the
difficulty
would
probably
be
not
so
much
to
find
a
candidate
for
the
crown
as
to
decide
between
the
conflicting
claims
of
a
multitude
of
competitors
in
point
of
fact
we
have
heard
of
a
shilluk
clamouring
to
be
made
king
on
condition
of
being
killed
at
the
end
of
a
brief
reign
of
a
single
day
and
we
have
read
how
in
malabar
a
crowd
scrambled
for
the
bloody
head
which
entitled
the
lucky
man
who
caught
it
to
be
decapitated
after
five
years
of
unlimited
enjoyment
and
how
at
calicut
many
men
used
to
rush
cheerfully
on
death
not
for
a
kingship
of
a
year
or
even
of
an
hour
but
merely
for
the
honour
of
displaying
their
valour
in
a
fruitless
attack
on
the
king
chapter
temporary

in
some
places
the
modified
form
of
the
old
custom
of
regicide
which
appears
to
have
prevailed
at
babylon
has
been
further
softened
down
the
king

abdicates
annually
for
a
short
time
and
his
place
is
filled
by
a
more
or

nominal

at
the
close
of
his
short
reign
the
latter
is
no

sometimes
a
mock
execution
still
survives

the
office
of
temporary
king
was
hereditary
in
a
family
distantly
connected
with
the
royal
house
the
sons
succeeding
the
fathers
and
the
younger
brothers
the
elder
brothers
just
as
in
the
succession
to
the
real
sovereignty
on
a
favourable
day
fixed
by
the
astrologers
the
temporary
king
was
conducted
by
the
mandarins
in
triumphal
procession
he
rode
one
of
the
royal
elephants
seated
in
the
royal
palanquin
and
escorted
by
soldiers
who
dressed
in
appropriate
costumes
represented
the
neighbouring
peoples
of
siam

and
so
on
in
place
of
the
golden
crown
he
wore
a
peaked
white
cap
and
his
regalia
instead
of
being
of
gold
encrusted
with
diamonds
were
of
rough
wood
after
paying
homage
to
the
real
king
from
whom
he
received
the
sovereignty
for
three
days
together
with
all
the
revenues
accruing
during
that
time
though
this
last
custom
has
been
omitted
for
some
time
he
moved
in
procession
round
the
palace
and
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
on
the
third
day
after
the
usual
procession
the
temporary
king
gave
orders
that
the
elephants
should
trample
under
foot
the
mountain
of
rice
which
was
a
scaffold
of
bamboo
surrounded
by
sheaves
of
rice
the
people
gathered
up
the
rice
each
man
taking
home
a
little
with
him
to
secure
a
good
harvest
some
of
it
was
also
taken
to
the
king
who
had
it
cooked
and
presented
to
the
monks
in
siam
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
moon
in
the
sixth
month
the
end
of
april
a
temporary
king
is
appointed
who
for
three
days
enjoys
the
royal
prerogatives
the
real
king
remaining
shut
up
in
his
palace
this
temporary
king
sends
his
numerous
satellites
in
all
directions
to
seize
and
confiscate
whatever
they
can
find
in
the
bazaar
and
open
shops
even
the
ships
and
junks
which
arrive
in
harbour
during
the
three
days
are
forfeited
to
him
and
must
be
redeemed
he
goes
to
a
field
in
the
middle
of
the
city
whither
they
bring
a
gilded
plough
drawn
by
oxen
after
the
plough
has
been
anointed
and
the
oxen
rubbed
with
incense
the
mock
king
traces
nine
furrows
with
the
plough
followed
by
aged
dames
of
the
palace
scattering
the
first
seed
of
the
season
as
soon
as
the
nine
furrows
are
drawn
the
crowd
of
spectators
rushes
in
and
scrambles
for
the
seed
which
has
just
been
sown
believing
that
mixed
with
the
it
will
ensure
a
plentiful
crop
then
the
oxen
are
unyoked
and
rice
maize
sesame
sago
bananas
melons
and
so
on
are
set
before
them
whatever
they
eat
first
will
it
is
thought
be
dear
in
the
year
following
though
some
people
interpret
the
omen
in
the
opposite
sense
during
this
time
the
temporary
king
stands
leaning
against
a
tree
with
his
right
foot
resting
on
his
left
knee
from
standing
thus
on
one
foot
he
is
popularly
known
as
king
hop
but
his
official
title
is
phaya
phollathep
lord
of
the
heavenly
he
is
a
sort
of
minister
of
agriculture
all
disputes
about
fields
rice
and
so
forth
are
referred
to
him
there
is
moreover
another
ceremony
in
which
he
personates
the
king
it
takes
place
in
the
second
month
which
falls
in
the
cold
season
and
lasts
three
days
he
is
conducted
in
procession
to
an
open
place
opposite
the
temple
of
the
brahmans
where
there
are
a
number
of
poles
dressed
like
upon
which
the
brahmans
swing
all
the
while
that
they
swing
and
dance
the
lord
of
the
heavenly
hosts
has
to
stand
on
one
foot
upon
a
seat
which
is
made
of
bricks
plastered
over
covered
with
a
white
cloth
and
hung
with
tapestry
he
is
supported
by
a
wooden
frame
with
a
gilt
canopy
and
two
brahmans
stand
one
on
each
side
of
him
the
dancing
brahmans
carry
buffalo
horns
with
which
they
draw
water
from
a
large
copper
caldron
and
sprinkle
it
on
the
spectators
this
is
supposed
to
bring
good
luck
causing
the
people
to
dwell
in
peace
and
quiet
health
and
prosperity
the
time
during
which
the
lord
of
the
heavenly
hosts
has
to
stand
on
one
foot
is
about
three
hours
this
is
thought
to
prove
the
dispositions
of
the
devattas
and
if
he
lets
his
foot
down
he
is
liable
to
forfeit
his
property
and
have
his
family
enslaved
by
the
king
as
it
is
believed
to
be
a
bad
omen
portending
destruction
to
the
state
and
instability
to
the
throne
but
if
he
stand
firm
he
is
believed
to
have
gained
a
victory
over
evil
spirits
and
he
has
moreover
the
privilege
ostensibly
at
least
of
seizing
any
ship
which
may
enter
the
harbour
during
these
three
days
and
taking
its
contents
and
also
of
entering
any
open
shop
in
the
town
and
carrying
away
what
he
such
were
the
duties
and
privileges
of
the
siamese
king
hop
down
to
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
or
later
under
the
reign
of
the
late
enlightened
monarch
this
quaint
personage
was
to
some
extent
both
shorn
of
the
glories
and
relieved
of
the
burden
of
his
office
he
still
watches
as
of
old
the
brahmans
rushing
through
the
air
in
a
swing
suspended
between
two
tall
masts
each
some
ninety
feet
high
but
he
is
allowed
to
sit
instead
of
stand
and
although
public
opinion
still
expects
him
to
keep
his
right
foot
on
his
left
knee
during
the
whole
of
the
ceremony
he
would
incur
no
legal
penalty
were
he
to
the
great
chagrin
of
the
people
to
put
his
weary
foot
to
the
ground
other
signs
too
tell
of
the
invasion
of
the
east
by
the
ideas
and
civilisation
of
the
west
the
thoroughfares
that
lead
to
the
scene
of
the
performance
are
blocked
with
carriages
and
telegraph
posts
to
which
eager
spectators
cling
like
monkeys
rise
above
the
dense
crowd
and
while
a
tatterdemalion
band
of
the
old
style
in
gaudy
garb
of
vermilion
and
yellow
bangs
and
tootles
away
on
drums
and
trumpets
of
an
antique
pattern
the
procession
of
barefooted
soldiers
in
brilliant
uniforms
steps
briskly
along
to
the
lively
strains
of
a
modern
military
band
playing
marching
through
on
the
first
day
of
the
sixth
month
which
was
regarded
as
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
king
and
people
of
samaracand
used
to
put
on
new
clothes
and
cut
their
hair
and
beards
then
they
repaired
to
a
forest
near
the
capital
where
they
shot
arrows
on
horseback
for
seven
days
on
the
last
day
the
target
was
a
gold
coin
and
he
who
hit
it
had
the
right
to
be
king
for
one
day
in
upper
egypt
on
the
first
day
of
the
solar
year
by
coptic
reckoning
that
is
on
the
tenth
of
september
when
the
nile
has
generally
reached
its
highest
point
the
regular
government
is
suspended
for
three
days
and
every
town
chooses
its
own
ruler
this
temporary
lord
wears
a
sort
of
tall
fool
s
cap
and
a
long
flaxen
beard
and
is
enveloped
in
a
strange
mantle
with
a
wand
of
office
in
his
hand
and
attended
by
men
disguised
as
scribes
executioners
and
so
forth
he
proceeds
to
the
governor
s
house
the
latter
allows
himself
to
be
deposed
and
the
mock
king
mounting
the
throne
holds
a
tribunal
to
the
decisions
of
which
even
the
governor
and
his
officials
must
bow
after
three
days
the
mock
king
is
condemned
to
death
the
envelope
or
shell
in
which
he
was
encased
is
committed
to
the
flames
and
from
its
ashes
the
fellah
creeps
forth
the
custom
perhaps
points
to
an
old
practice
of
burning
a
real
king
in
grim
earnest
in
uganda
the
brothers
of
the
king
used
to
be
burned
because
it
was
not
lawful
to
shed
the
royal
blood
the
mohammedan
students
of
fez
in
morocco
are
allowed
to
appoint
a
sultan
of
their
own
who
reigns
for
a
few
weeks
and
is
known
as
the
sultan
of
the
this
brief
authority
is
put
up
for
auction
and
knocked
down
to
the
highest
bidder
it
brings
some
substantial
privileges
with
it
for
the
holder
is
freed
from
taxes
thenceforward
and
he
has
the
right
of
asking
a
favour
from
the
real
sultan
that
favour
is
seldom
refused
it
usually
consists
in
the
release
of
a
prisoner
moreover
the
agents
of
the
levy
fines
on
the
shopkeepers
and
householders
against
whom
they
trump
up
various
humorous
charges
the
temporary
sultan
is
surrounded
with
the
pomp
of
a
real
court
and
parades
the
streets
in
state
with
music
and
shouting
while
a
royal
umbrella
is
held
over
his
head
with
the
fines
and
offerings
to
which
the
real
sultan
adds
a
liberal
supply
of
provisions
the
students
have
enough
to
furnish
forth
a
magnificent
banquet
and
altogether
they
enjoy
themselves
thoroughly
indulging
in
all
kinds
of
games
and
amusements
for
the
first
seven
days
the
mock
sultan
remains
in
the
college
then
he
goes
about
a
mile
out
of
the
town
and
encamps
on
the
bank
of
the
river
attended
by
the
students
and
not
a
few
of
the
citizens
on
the
seventh
day
of
his
stay
outside
the
town
he
is
visited
by
the
real
sultan
who
grants
him
his
request
and
gives
him
seven
more
days
to
reign
so
that
the
reign
of
the
sultan
of
the
scribes
nominally
lasts
three
weeks
but
when
six
days
of
the
last
week
have
passed
the
mock
sultan
runs
back
to
the
town
by
night
this
temporary
sultanship
always
falls
in
spring
about
the
beginning
of
april
its
origin
is
said
to
have
been
as
follows
when
mulai
rasheed
ii
was
fighting
for
the
throne
in
or
a
certain
jew
usurped
the
royal
authority
at
taza
but
the
rebellion
was
soon
suppressed
through
the
loyalty
and
devotion
of
the
students
to
effect
their
purpose
they
resorted
to
an
ingenious
stratagem
forty
of
them
caused
themselves
to
be
packed
in
chests
which
were
sent
as
a
present
to
the
usurper
in
the
dead
of
night
while
the
unsuspecting
jew
was
slumbering
peacefully
among
the
the
lids
were
stealthily
raised
the
brave
forty
crept
forth
slew
the
usurper
and
took
possession
of
the
city
in
the
name
of
the
real
sultan
who
to
mark
his
gratitude
for
the
help
thus
rendered
him
in
time
of
need
conferred
on
the
students
the
right
of
annually
appointing
a
sultan
of
their
own
the
narrative
has
all
the
air
of
a
fiction
devised
to
explain
an
old
custom
of
which
the
real
meaning
and
origin
had
been
forgotten
a
custom
of
annually
appointing
a
mock
king
for
a
single
day
was
observed
at
lostwithiel
in
cornwall
down
to
the
sixteenth
century
on
little
easter
sunday
the
freeholders
of
the
town
and
manor
assembled
together
either
in
person
or
by
their
deputies
and
one
among
them
as
it
fell
to
his
lot
by
turn
gaily
attired
and
gallantly
mounted
with
a
crown
on
his
head
a
sceptre
in
his
hand
and
a
sword
borne
before
him
rode
through
the
principal
street
to
the
church
dutifully
attended
by
all
the
rest
on
horseback
the
clergyman
in
his
best
robes
received
him
at
the
churchyard
stile
and
conducted
him
to
hear
divine
service
on
leaving
the
church
he
repaired
with
the
same
pomp
to
a
house
provided
for
his
reception
here
a
feast
awaited
him
and
his
suite
and
being
set
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
was
served
on
bended
knees
with
all
the
rites
due
to
the
estate
of
a
prince
the
ceremony
ended
with
the
dinner
and
every
man
returned
home
sometimes
the
temporary
king
occupies
the
throne
not
annually
but
once
for
all
at
the
beginning
of
each
reign
thus
in
the
kingdom
of
jambi
in
sumatra
it
is
the
custom
that
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
reign
a
man
of
the
people
should
occupy
the
throne
and
exercise
the
royal
prerogatives
for
a
single
day
the
origin
of
the
custom
is
explained
by
a
tradition
that
there
were
once
five
royal
brothers
the
four
elder
of
whom
all
declined
the
throne
on
the
ground
of
various
bodily
defects
leaving
it
to
their
youngest
brother
but
the
eldest
occupied
the
throne
for
one
day
and
reserved
for
his
descendants
a
similar
privilege
at
the
beginning
of
every
reign
thus
the
office
of
temporary
king
is
hereditary
in
a
family
akin
to
the
royal
house
in
bilaspur
it
seems
to
be
the
custom
after
the
death
of
a
rajah
for
a
brahman
to
eat
rice
out
of
the
dead
rajah
s
hand
and
then
to
occupy
the
throne
for
a
year
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
brahman
receives
presents
and
is
dismissed
from
the
territory
being
forbidden
apparently
to
return
the
idea
seems
to
be
that
the
spirit
of
the
rájá
enters
into
the
bráhman
who
eats
the
rice
and
milk
out
of
his
hand
when
he
is
dead
as
the
brahman
is
apparently
carefully
watched
during
the
whole
year
and
not
allowed
to
go
the
same
or
a
similar
custom
is
believed
to
obtain
among
the
hill
states
about
kangra
the
custom
of
banishing
the
brahman
who
represents
the
king
may
be
a
substitute
for
putting
him
to
death
at
the
installation
of
a
prince
of
carinthia
a
peasant
in
whose
family
the
office
was
hereditary
ascended
a
marble
stone
which
stood
surrounded
by
meadows
in
a
spacious
valley
on
his
right
stood
a
black
on
his
left
a
lean
ugly
mare
a
rustic
crowd
gathered
about
him
then
the
future
prince
dressed
as
a
peasant
and
carrying
a
shepherd
s
staff
drew
near
attended
by
courtiers
and
magistrates
on
perceiving
him
the
peasant
called
out
who
is
this
whom
i
see
coming
so
proudly
along
the
people
answered
the
prince
of
the
the
peasant
was
then
prevailed
on
to
surrender
the
marble
seat
to
the
prince
on
condition
of
receiving
sixty
pence
the
cow
and
mare
and
exemption
from
taxes
but
before
yielding
his
place
he
gave
the
prince
a
light
blow
on
the
cheek
some
points
about
these
temporary
kings
deserve
to
be
specially
noticed
before
we
pass
to
the
next
branch
of
the
evidence
in
the
first
place
the
cambodian
and
siamese
examples
shew
clearly
that
it
is
especially
the
divine
or
magical
functions
of
the
king
which
are
transferred
to
his
temporary
substitute
this
appears
from
the
belief
that
by
keeping
up
his
foot
the
temporary
king
of
siam
gained
a
victory
over
the
evil
spirits
whereas
by
letting
it
down
he
imperilled
the
existence
of
the
state
again
the
cambodian
ceremony
of
trampling
down
the
mountain
of
rice
and
the
siamese
ceremony
of
opening
the
ploughing
and
sowing
are
charms
to
produce
a
plentiful
harvest
as
appears
from
the
belief
that
those
who
carry
home
some
of
the
trampled
rice
or
of
the
seed
sown
will
thereby
secure
a
good
crop
moreover
when
the
siamese
representative
of
the
king
is
guiding
the
plough
the
people
watch
him
anxiously
not
to
see
whether
he
drives
a
straight
furrow
but
to
mark
the
exact
point
on
his
leg
to
which
the
skirt
of
his
silken
robe
reaches
for
on
that
is
supposed
to
hang
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
crops
during
the
ensuing
season
if
the
lord
of
the
heavenly
hosts
hitches
up
his
garment
above
his
knee
the
weather
will
be
wet
and
heavy
rains
will
spoil
the
harvest
if
he
lets
it
trail
to
his
ankle
a
drought
will
be
the
consequence
but
fine
weather
and
heavy
crops
will
follow
if
the
hem
of
his
robe
hangs
exactly
down
the
calf
of
his
leg
so
closely
is
the
course
of
nature
and
with
it
the
weal
or
woe
of
the
people
dependent
on
the
minutest
act
or
gesture
of
the
king
s
representative
but
the
task
of
making
the
crops
grow
thus
deputed
to
the
temporary
kings
is
one
of
the
magical
functions
regularly
supposed
to
be
discharged
by
kings
in
primitive
society
the
rule
that
the
mock
king
must
stand
on
one
foot
upon
a
raised
seat
in
the
was
perhaps
originally
meant
as
a
charm
to
make
the
crop
grow
high
at
least
this
was
the
object
of
a
similar
ceremony
observed
by
the
old
prussians
the
tallest
girl
standing
on
one
foot
upon
a
seat
with
her
lap
full
of
cakes
a
cup
of
brandy
in
her
right
hand
and
a
piece
of
or
in
her
left
prayed
to
the
god
waizganthos
that
the
flax
might
grow
as
high
as
she
was
standing
then
after
draining
the
cup
she
had
it
refilled
and
poured
the
brandy
on
the
ground
as
an
offering
to
waizganthos
and
threw
down
the
cakes
for
his
attendant
sprites
if
she
remained
steady
on
one
foot
throughout
the
ceremony
it
was
an
omen
that
the
flax
crop
would
be
good
but
if
she
let
her
foot
down
it
was
feared
that
the
crop
might
fail
the
same
significance
perhaps
attaches
to
the
swinging
of
the
brahmans
which
the
lord
of
the
heavenly
hosts
had
formerly
to
witness
standing
on
one
foot
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
it
might
be
thought
that
the
higher
the
priests
swing
the
higher
will
grow
the
rice
for
the
ceremony
is
described
as
a
harvest
festival
and
swinging
is
practised
by
the
letts
of
russia
with
the
avowed
intention
of
influencing
the
growth
of
the
crops
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
between
easter
and
john
s
day
the
summer
solstice
every
lettish
peasant
is
said
to
devote
his
leisure
hours
to
swinging
diligently
for
the
higher
he
rises
in
the
air
the
higher
will
his
flax
grow
that
season
the
gilded
plough
with
which
the
siamese
mock
king
opens
the
ploughing
may
be
compared
with
the
bronze
ploughs
which
the
etruscans
employed
at
the
ceremony
of
founding
cities
in
both
cases
the
use
of
bare
iron
was
probably
forbidden
on
superstitious
grounds
in
the
foregoing
cases
the
temporary
king
is
appointed
annually
in
accordance
with
a
regular
custom
but
in
other
cases
the
appointment
is
made
only
to
meet
a
special
emergency
such
as
to
relieve
the
real
king
from
some
actual
or
threatened
evil
by
diverting
it
to
a
substitute
who
takes
his
place
on
the
throne
for
a
short
time
the
history
of
persia
furnishes
instances
of
such
occasional
substitutes
for
the
shah
thus
shah
abbas
the
great
the
most
eminent
of
all
the
kings
of
persia
who
reigned
from
to
being
warned
by
his
astrologers
in
the
year
that
a
serious
danger
impended
over
him
attempted
to
avert
the
omen
by
abdicating
the
throne
and
appointing
a
certain
unbeliever
named
yusoofee
probably
a
christian
to
reign
in
his
stead
the
substitute
was
accordingly
crowned
and
for
three
days
if
we
may
trust
the
persian
historians
he
enjoyed
not
only
the
name
and
the
state
but
the
power
of
the
king
at
the
end
of
his
brief
reign
he
was
put
to
death
the
decree
of
the
stars
was
fulfilled
by
this
sacrifice
and
abbas
who
reascended
his
throne
in
a
most
propitious
hour
was
promised
by
his
astrologers
a
long
and
glorious
reign
again
shah
sufi
who
reigned
from
to
was
crowned
a
second
time
and
changed
his
name
to
sulaiman
or
soliman
under
the
following
circumstances
the
king
a
few
days
after
was
out
of
danger
but
the
matter
was
to
restore
him
to
perfect
health
having
been
always
in
a
languishing
condition
and
his
physicians
never
able
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
distemper
he
suspected
that
their
ignorance
retarded
his
recovery
and
two
or
three
of
them
were
therefore
ill
treated
at
length
the
other
physicians
fearing
it
might
be
their
own
turn
next
bethought
themselves
that
persia
being
at
the
same
time
afflicted
with
a
scarcity
of
provisions
and
the
king
s
sickness
the
fault
must
be
in
the
astrologers
who
had
not
chosen
a
favourable
hour
when
the
king
was
set
upon
the
throne
and
therefore
persuaded
him
that
the
ceremony
must
be
perform
d
again
and
he
change
his
name
in
a
more
lucky
minute
the
king
and
his
council
approving
of
their
notion
the
physicians
and
astrologers
together
expected
the
first
unfortunate
day
which
according
to
their
superstition
was
to
be
followed
in
the
evening
by
a
propitious
hour
among
the
gavres
or
original
persians
worshippers
of
fire
there
are
some
who
boast
their
descent
from
the
rustans
who
formerly
reigned
over
persia
and
parthia
on
the
morning
of
the
aforesaid
unlucky
day
they
took
one
of
these
gavres
of
that
and
having
plac
d
him
on
the
throne
with
his
back
against
a
figure
that
represented
him
to
the
life
all
the
great
men
of
the
court
came
to
attend
him
as
if
he
had
been
their
king
performing
all
that
he
commanded
this
scene
lasted
till
the
favourable
hour
which
was
a
little
before
and
then
an
officer
of
the
court
came
behind
and
cut
off
the
head
of
the
wooden
statue
with
his
cymiter
the
gaure
then
starting
up
and
running
away
that
very
moment
the
king
came
into
the
hall
and
the
sofy
s
cap
being
set
on
his
head
and
his
sword
girt
to
his
side
he
sat
down
on
the
throne
changing
his
name
for
that
of
soliman
which
was
perform
d
with
the
usual
ceremonies
the
drums
beating
and
trumpets
sounding
as
before
it
was
requisite
to
act
this
farce
in
order
to
satisfy
the
law
which
requires
that
in
order
to
change
his
name
and
take
possession
of
the
throne
again
he
must
expel
a
prince
that
had
usurped
it
upon
some
pretensions
and
therefore
they
made
choice
of
a
gaure
who
pretended
to
be
descended
from
the
ancient
kings
of
persia
and
was
besides
of
a
different
religion
from
that
of
the
chapter
vi
sacrifice
of
the
king
s
son
a
point
to
notice
about
the
temporary
kings
described
in
the
foregoing
chapter
is
that
in
two
places
cambodia
and
jambi
they
come
of
a
stock
which
is
believed
to
be
akin
to
the
royal
family
if
the
view
here
taken
of
the
origin
of
these
temporary
kingships
is
correct
we
can
easily
understand
why
the
king
s
substitute
should
sometimes
be
of
the
same
race
as
the
king
when
the
king
first
succeeded
in
getting
the
life
of
another
accepted
as
a
sacrifice
instead
of
his
own
he
would
have
to
shew
that
the
death
of
that
other
would
serve
the
purpose
quite
as
well
as
his
own
would
have
done
now
it
was
as
a
god
or
demigod
that
the
king
had
to
die
therefore
the
substitute
who
died
for
him
had
to
be
invested
at
least
for
the
occasion
with
the
divine
attributes
of
the
king
this
as
we
have
just
seen
was
certainly
the
case
with
the
temporary
kings
of
siam
and
cambodia
they
were
invested
with
the
supernatural
functions
which
in
an
earlier
stage
of
society
were
the
special
attributes
of
the
king
but
no
one
could
so
well
represent
the
king
in
his
divine
character
as
his
son
who
might
be
supposed
to
share
the
divine
afflatus
of
his
father
no
one
therefore
could
so
appropriately
die
for
the
king
and
through
him
for
the
whole
people
as
the
king
s
son
according
to
tradition
aun
or
on
king
of
sweden
sacrificed
nine
of
his
sons
to
odin
at
upsala
in
order
that
his
own
life
might
be
spared
after
he
had
sacrificed
his
second
son
he
received
from
the
god
an
answer
that
he
should
live
so
long
as
he
gave
him
one
of
his
sons
every
ninth
year
when
he
had
sacrificed
his
seventh
son
he
still
lived
but
was
so
feeble
that
he
could
not
walk
but
had
to
be
carried
in
a
chair
then
he
offered
up
his
eighth
son
and
lived
nine
years
more
lying
in
his
bed
after
that
he
sacrificed
his
ninth
son
and
lived
another
nine
years
but
so
that
he
drank
out
of
a
horn
like
a
weaned
child
he
now
wished
to
sacrifice
his
only
remaining
son
to
odin
but
the
swedes
would
not
allow
him
so
he
died
and
was
buried
in
a
mound
at
upsala
the
poet
thiodolf
told
the
king
s
history
in
verse
in
upsal
s
town
the
cruel
king
slaughtered
his
sons
at
odin
s
slaughtered
his
sons
with
cruel
knife
to
get
from
odin
length
of
life
he
lived
until
he
had
to
turn
his
toothless
mouth
to
the
deer
s
horn
and
he
who
shed
his
children
s
blood
sucked
through
the
ox
s
horn
his
food
at
length
fell
death
has
tracked
him
down
slowly
but
sure
in
upsal
s
in
ancient
greece
there
seems
to
have
been
at
least
one
kingly
house
of
great
antiquity
of
which
the
eldest
sons
were
always
liable
to
be
sacrificed
in
room
of
their
royal
sires
when
xerxes
was
marching
through
thessaly
at
the
head
of
his
mighty
host
to
attack
the
spartans
at
thermopylae
he
came
to
the
town
of
alus
here
he
was
shewn
the
sanctuary
of
laphystian
zeus
about
which
his
guides
told
him
a
strange
tale
it
ran
somewhat
as
follows
once
upon
a
time
the
king
of
the
country
by
name
athamas
married
a
wife
nephele
and
had
by
her
a
son
called
phrixus
and
a
daughter
named
helle
afterwards
he
took
to
himself
a
second
wife
called
ino
by
whom
he
had
two
sons
learchus
and
melicertes
but
his
second
wife
was
jealous
of
her
phrixus
and
helle
and
plotted
their
death
she
went
about
very
cunningly
to
compass
her
bad
end
first
of
all
she
persuaded
the
women
of
the
country
to
roast
the
seed
corn
secretly
before
it
was
committed
to
the
ground
so
next
year
no
crops
came
up
and
the
people
died
of
famine
then
the
king
sent
messengers
to
the
oracle
at
delphi
to
enquire
the
cause
of
the
dearth
but
the
wicked
bribed
the
messenger
to
give
out
as
the
answer
of
the
god
that
the
dearth
would
never
cease
till
the
children
of
athamas
by
his
first
wife
had
been
sacrificed
to
zeus
when
athamas
heard
that
he
sent
for
the
children
who
were
with
the
sheep
but
a
ram
with
a
fleece
of
gold
opened
his
lips
and
speaking
with
the
voice
of
a
man
warned
the
children
of
their
danger
so
they
mounted
the
ram
and
fled
with
him
over
land
and
sea
as
they
flew
over
the
sea
the
girl
slipped
from
the
animal
s
back
and
falling
into
water
was
drowned
but
her
brother
phrixus
was
brought
safe
to
the
land
of
colchis
where
reigned
a
child
of
the
sun
phrixus
married
the
king
s
daughter
and
she
bore
him
a
son
cytisorus
and
there
he
sacrificed
the
ram
with
the
golden
fleece
to
zeus
the
god
of
flight
but
some
will
have
it
that
he
sacrificed
the
animal
to
laphystian
zeus
the
golden
fleece
itself
he
gave
to
his
wife
s
father
who
nailed
it
to
an
oak
tree
guarded
by
a
sleepless
dragon
in
a
sacred
grove
of
ares
meanwhile
at
home
an
oracle
had
commanded
that
king
athamas
himself
should
be
sacrificed
as
an
expiatory
offering
for
the
whole
country
so
the
people
decked
him
with
garlands
like
a
victim
and
led
him
to
the
altar
where
they
were
just
about
to
sacrifice
him
when
he
was
rescued
either
by
his
grandson
cytisorus
who
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
from
colchis
or
by
hercules
who
brought
tidings
that
the
king
s
son
phrixus
was
yet
alive
thus
athamas
was
saved
but
afterwards
he
went
mad
and
mistaking
his
son
learchus
for
a
wild
beast
shot
him
dead
next
he
attempted
the
life
of
his
remaining
son
melicertes
but
the
child
was
rescued
by
his
mother
ino
who
ran
and
threw
herself
and
him
from
a
high
rock
into
the
sea
mother
and
son
were
changed
into
marine
divinities
and
the
son
received
special
homage
in
the
isle
of
tenedos
where
babes
were
sacrificed
to
him
thus
bereft
of
wife
and
children
the
unhappy
athamas
quitted
his
country
and
on
enquiring
of
the
oracle
where
he
should
dwell
was
told
to
take
up
his
abode
wherever
he
should
be
entertained
by
wild
beasts
he
fell
in
with
a
pack
of
wolves
devouring
sheep
and
when
they
saw
him
they
fled
and
left
him
the
bleeding
remnants
of
their
prey
in
this
way
the
oracle
was
fulfilled
but
because
king
athamas
had
not
been
sacrificed
as
a
for
the
whole
country
it
was
divinely
decreed
that
the
eldest
male
scion
of
his
family
in
each
generation
should
be
sacrificed
without
fail
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
where
the
offerings
were
made
to
laphystian
zeus
by
one
of
the
house
of
athamas
many
of
the
family
xerxes
was
informed
had
fled
to
foreign
lands
to
escape
this
doom
but
some
of
them
had
returned
long
afterwards
and
being
caught
by
the
sentinels
in
the
act
of
entering
the
were
wreathed
as
victims
led
forth
in
procession
and
sacrificed
these
instances
appear
to
have
been
notorious
if
not
frequent
for
the
writer
of
a
dialogue
attributed
to
plato
after
speaking
of
the
immolation
of
human
victims
by
the
carthaginians
adds
that
such
practices
were
not
unknown
among
the
greeks
and
he
refers
with
horror
to
the
sacrifices
offered
on
mount
lycaeus
and
by
the
descendants
of
athamas
the
suspicion
that
this
barbarous
custom
by
no
means
fell
into
disuse
even
in
later
days
is
strengthened
by
a
case
of
human
sacrifice
which
occurred
in
plutarch
s
time
at
orchomenus
a
very
ancient
city
of
boeotia
distant
only
a
few
miles
across
the
plain
from
the
historian
s
birthplace
here
dwelt
a
family
of
which
the
men
went
by
the
name
of
psoloeis
or
sooty
and
the
women
by
the
name
of
oleae
or
every
year
at
the
festival
of
the
agrionia
the
priest
of
dionysus
pursued
these
women
with
a
drawn
sword
and
if
he
overtook
one
of
them
he
had
the
right
to
slay
her
in
plutarch
s
lifetime
the
right
was
actually
exercised
by
a
priest
zoilus
now
the
family
thus
liable
to
furnish
at
least
one
human
victim
every
year
was
of
royal
descent
for
they
traced
their
lineage
to
minyas
the
famous
old
king
of
orchomenus
the
monarch
of
fabulous
wealth
whose
stately
treasury
as
it
is
called
still
stands
in
ruins
at
the
point
where
the
long
rocky
hill
of
orchomenus
melts
into
the
vast
level
expanse
of
the
copaic
plain
tradition
ran
that
the
king
s
three
daughters
long
despised
the
other
women
of
the
country
for
yielding
to
the
bacchic
frenzy
and
sat
at
home
in
the
king
s
house
scornfully
plying
the
distaff
and
the
loom
while
the
rest
wreathed
with
flowers
their
dishevelled
locks
streaming
to
the
wind
roamed
in
ecstasy
the
barren
mountains
that
rise
above
orchomenus
making
the
solitude
of
the
hills
to
echo
to
the
wild
music
of
cymbals
and
tambourines
but
in
time
the
divine
fury
infected
even
the
royal
damsels
in
their
quiet
chamber
they
were
seized
with
a
fierce
longing
to
partake
of
human
flesh
and
cast
lots
among
themselves
which
should
give
up
her
child
to
furnish
a
cannibal
feast
the
lot
fell
on
leucippe
and
she
surrendered
her
son
hippasus
who
was
torn
limb
from
limb
by
the
three
from
these
misguided
women
sprang
the
oleae
and
the
psoloeis
of
whom
the
men
were
said
to
be
so
called
because
they
wore
raiment
in
token
of
their
mourning
and
grief
now
this
practice
of
taking
human
victims
from
a
family
of
royal
descent
at
orchomenus
is
all
the
more
significant
because
athamas
himself
is
said
to
have
reigned
in
the
land
of
orchomenus
even
before
the
time
of
minyas
and
because
over
against
the
city
there
rises
mount
laphystius
on
which
as
at
alus
in
thessaly
there
was
a
sanctuary
of
laphystian
zeus
where
according
to
tradition
athamas
purposed
to
sacrifice
his
two
children
phrixus
and
helle
on
the
whole
comparing
the
traditions
about
athamas
with
the
custom
that
obtained
with
regard
to
his
descendants
in
historical
times
we
may
fairly
infer
that
in
thessaly
and
probably
in
boeotia
there
reigned
of
old
a
dynasty
of
which
the
kings
were
liable
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
good
of
the
country
to
the
god
called
laphystian
zeus
but
that
they
contrived
to
shift
the
fatal
responsibility
to
their
offspring
of
whom
the
eldest
son
was
regularly
destined
to
the
altar
as
time
went
on
the
cruel
custom
was
so
far
mitigated
that
a
ram
was
accepted
as
a
vicarious
sacrifice
in
room
of
the
royal
victim
provided
always
that
the
prince
abstained
from
setting
foot
in
the
where
the
sacrifices
were
offered
to
laphystian
zeus
by
one
of
his
kinsmen
but
if
he
were
rash
enough
to
enter
the
place
of
doom
to
thrust
himself
wilfully
as
it
were
on
the
notice
of
the
god
who
had
winked
at
the
substitution
of
a
ram
the
ancient
obligation
which
had
been
suffered
to
lie
in
abeyance
recovered
all
its
force
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
he
must
die
the
tradition
which
associated
the
sacrifice
of
the
king
or
his
children
with
a
great
dearth
points
clearly
to
the
belief
so
common
among
primitive
folk
that
the
king
is
responsible
for
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
that
he
may
justly
pay
with
his
life
for
the
inclemency
of
the
one
or
the
failure
of
the
other
athamas
and
his
line
in
short
appear
to
have
united
divine
or
magical
with
royal
functions
and
this
view
is
strongly
supported
by
the
claims
to
divinity
which
salmoneus
the
brother
of
athamas
is
said
to
have
set
up
we
have
seen
that
this
presumptuous
mortal
professed
to
be
no
other
than
zeus
himself
and
to
wield
the
thunder
and
lightning
of
which
he
made
a
trumpery
imitation
by
the
help
of
tinkling
kettles
and
blazing
torches
if
we
may
judge
from
analogy
his
mock
thunder
and
lightning
were
no
mere
scenic
exhibition
designed
to
deceive
and
impress
the
beholders
they
were
enchantments
practised
by
the
royal
magician
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
about
the
celestial
phenomena
which
they
feebly
mimicked
among
the
semites
of
western
asia
the
king
in
a
time
of
national
danger
sometimes
gave
his
own
son
to
die
as
a
sacrifice
for
the
people
thus
philo
of
byblus
in
his
work
on
the
jews
says
it
was
an
ancient
custom
in
a
crisis
of
great
danger
that
the
ruler
of
a
city
or
nation
should
give
his
beloved
son
to
die
for
the
whole
people
as
a
ransom
offered
to
the
avenging
demons
and
the
children
thus
offered
were
slain
with
mystic
rites
so
cronus
whom
the
phoenicians
call
israel
being
king
of
the
land
and
having
an
son
called
jeoud
for
in
the
phoenician
tongue
jeoud
signifies
dressed
him
in
royal
robes
and
sacrificed
him
upon
an
altar
in
a
time
of
war
when
the
country
was
in
great
danger
from
the
when
the
king
of
moab
was
besieged
by
the
israelites
and
hard
beset
he
took
his
eldest
son
who
should
have
reigned
in
his
stead
and
offered
him
for
a
burnt
offering
on
the
wall
but
amongst
the
semites
the
practice
of
sacrificing
their
children
was
not
confined
to
kings
in
times
of
great
calamity
such
as
pestilence
drought
or
defeat
in
war
the
phoenicians
used
to
sacrifice
one
of
their
dearest
to
baal
phoenician
history
says
an
ancient
writer
is
full
of
such
the
writer
of
a
dialogue
ascribed
to
plato
observes
that
the
carthaginians
immolated
human
beings
as
if
it
were
right
and
lawful
to
do
so
and
some
of
them
he
adds
even
sacrificed
their
own
sons
to
baal
when
gelo
tyrant
of
syracuse
defeated
the
carthaginians
in
the
great
battle
of
himera
he
required
as
a
condition
of
peace
that
they
should
sacrifice
their
children
to
baal
no
longer
but
the
barbarous
custom
was
too
inveterate
and
too
agreeable
to
semitic
modes
of
thought
to
be
so
easily
eradicated
and
the
humane
stipulation
of
the
greek
despot
probably
remained
a
dead
letter
at
all
events
the
history
of
this
remarkable
people
who
combined
in
so
high
a
degree
the
spirit
of
commercial
enterprise
with
a
blind
attachment
to
a
stern
and
gloomy
religion
is
stained
in
later
times
with
instances
of
the
same
cruel
superstition
when
the
carthaginians
were
defeated
and
besieged
by
agathocles
they
ascribed
their
disasters
to
the
wrath
of
baal
for
whereas
in
former
times
they
had
been
wont
to
sacrifice
to
him
their
own
offspring
they
had
latterly
fallen
into
the
habit
of
buying
children
and
rearing
them
to
be
victims
so
to
appease
the
angry
god
two
hundred
children
of
the
noblest
families
were
picked
out
for
sacrifice
and
the
tale
of
victims
was
swelled
by
not
less
than
three
hundred
more
who
volunteered
to
die
for
the
fatherland
they
were
sacrificed
by
being
placed
one
by
one
on
the
sloping
hands
of
the
brazen
image
from
which
they
rolled
into
a
pit
of
fire
childless
people
among
the
carthaginians
bought
children
from
poor
parents
and
slaughtered
them
says
plutarch
as
if
they
were
lambs
or
chickens
and
the
mother
had
to
stand
by
and
see
it
done
without
a
tear
or
a
groan
for
if
she
wept
or
moaned
she
lost
all
the
credit
and
the
child
was
sacrificed
none
the
less
but
all
the
place
in
front
of
the
image
was
filled
with
a
tumultuous
music
of
fifes
and
drums
to
drown
the
shrieks
of
the
victims
infants
were
publicly
sacrificed
by
the
carthaginians
down
to
the
proconsulate
of
tiberius
who
crucified
the
priests
on
the
trees
beside
their
temples
yet
the
practice
still
went
on
secretly
in
the
lifetime
of
tertullian
among
the
canaanites
or
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
palestine
whom
the
invading
israelites
conquered
but
did
not
exterminate
the
grisly
custom
of
burning
their
children
in
honour
of
baal
or
moloch
seems
to
have
been
regularly
practised
to
the
best
representatives
of
the
hebrew
people
the
authors
of
their
noble
literature
such
rites
were
abhorrent
and
they
warned
their
against
participating
in
them
when
thou
art
come
into
the
land
which
the
lord
thy
god
giveth
thee
thou
shalt
not
learn
to
do
after
the
abominations
of
those
nations
there
shall
not
be
found
with
thee
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
one
that
useth
divination
one
that
practiseth
augury
or
an
enchanter
or
a
sorcerer
or
a
charmer
or
a
consulter
with
a
familiar
spirit
or
a
wizard
or
a
necromancer
for
whosoever
doeth
these
things
is
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
because
of
these
abominations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
again
we
read
and
thou
shalt
not
give
any
of
thy
seed
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
whatever
effect
these
warnings
may
have
had
in
the
earlier
days
of
israelitish
history
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
in
later
times
the
hebrews
lapsed
or
rather
perhaps
relapsed
into
that
congenial
mire
of
superstition
from
which
the
higher
spirits
of
the
nation
often
in
rescue
them
the
psalmist
laments
that
his
erring
countrymen
mingled
themselves
with
the
nations
and
learned
their
works
and
they
served
their
idols
which
became
a
snare
unto
them
yea
they
sacrificed
their
sons
and
their
daughters
unto
demons
and
shed
innocent
blood
even
the
blood
of
their
sons
and
of
their
daughters
whom
they
sacrificed
unto
the
idols
of
canaan
and
the
land
was
polluted
with
when
the
hebrew
annalist
has
recorded
how
shalmaneser
king
of
assyria
besieged
samaria
for
three
years
and
took
it
and
carried
israel
away
into
captivity
he
explains
that
this
was
a
divine
punishment
inflicted
on
his
people
for
having
fallen
in
with
the
evil
ways
of
the
canaanites
they
had
built
high
places
in
all
their
cities
and
set
up
pillars
and
sacred
poles
upon
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
they
burnt
incense
after
the
manner
of
the
heathen
and
they
forsook
all
the
commandments
of
the
lord
their
god
and
made
them
molten
images
even
two
calves
and
made
an
asherah
and
worshipped
all
the
host
of
heaven
and
served
baal
and
they
caused
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
pass
through
the
fire
and
used
divination
and
at
jerusalem
in
these
days
there
was
a
regularly
appointed
place
where
parents
burned
their
children
both
boys
and
girls
in
honour
of
baal
or
moloch
it
was
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
just
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
and
bore
the
name
infamous
ever
since
of
tophet
the
practice
is
referred
to
again
and
again
with
sorrowful
indignation
by
the
prophets
the
kings
of
judah
set
an
example
to
their
people
by
burning
their
own
children
at
the
usual
place
thus
of
ahaz
who
reigned
sixteen
years
at
jerusalem
we
are
told
that
he
burnt
incense
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
and
burnt
his
children
in
the
again
king
manasseh
whose
long
reign
covered
years
made
his
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
in
the
valley
of
afterwards
in
the
reign
of
the
good
king
josiah
the
idolatrous
excesses
of
the
people
were
repressed
at
least
for
a
time
and
among
other
measures
of
reform
tophet
was
defiled
by
the
king
s
orders
that
no
man
might
make
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
to
whether
the
place
was
ever
used
again
for
the
same
dark
purpose
as
before
does
not
appear
long
afterwards
under
the
sway
of
a
milder
faith
there
was
little
in
the
valley
to
recall
the
tragic
scenes
which
it
had
so
often
witnessed
jerome
describes
it
as
a
pleasant
and
shady
spot
watered
by
the
rills
of
siloam
and
laid
out
in
delightful
gardens
it
would
be
interesting
though
it
might
be
fruitless
to
enquire
how
far
the
hebrew
prophets
and
psalmists
were
right
in
their
opinion
that
the
israelites
learned
these
and
other
gloomy
superstitions
only
through
contact
with
the
old
inhabitants
of
the
land
that
the
primitive
purity
of
faith
and
morals
which
they
brought
with
them
from
the
free
air
of
the
desert
was
tainted
and
polluted
by
the
grossness
and
corruption
of
the
heathen
in
the
fat
land
of
canaan
when
we
remember
however
that
the
israelites
were
of
the
same
semitic
stock
as
the
population
they
conquered
and
professed
to
despise
and
that
the
practice
of
human
sacrifice
is
attested
for
many
branches
of
the
semitic
race
we
shall
perhaps
incline
to
surmise
that
the
chosen
people
may
have
brought
with
them
into
palestine
the
seeds
which
afterwards
sprang
up
and
bore
such
ghastly
fruit
in
the
valley
of
hinnom
it
is
at
least
significant
of
the
prevalence
of
such
customs
among
the
semites
that
no
sooner
were
the
native
israelites
carried
off
by
king
shalmaneser
to
assyria
than
their
place
was
taken
by
colonists
who
practised
precisely
the
same
rites
in
honour
of
deities
who
probably
differed
in
little
but
name
from
those
revered
by
the
idolatrous
hebrews
the
sepharvites
we
are
told
burnt
their
children
in
the
fire
to
adrammelech
and
anammelech
the
gods
of
the
pious
jewish
historian
who
saw
in
israel
s
exile
god
s
punishment
for
sin
has
suggested
no
explanation
of
that
mystery
in
the
divine
economy
which
suffered
the
sepharvites
to
continue
on
the
same
spot
the
very
same
abominations
for
which
the
erring
hebrews
had
just
been
so
signally
chastised
we
have
still
to
ask
which
of
their
children
the
semites
picked
out
for
sacrifice
for
that
a
choice
was
made
and
some
principle
of
selection
followed
may
be
taken
for
granted
a
people
who
burned
all
their
children
indiscriminately
would
soon
extinguish
themselves
and
such
an
excess
of
piety
is
probably
rare
if
not
unknown
in
point
of
fact
it
seems
at
least
among
the
hebrews
to
have
been
only
the
firstborn
child
that
was
doomed
to
the
flames
the
prophet
micah
asks
in
a
familiar
passage
wherewith
shall
i
come
before
the
lord
and
bow
myself
before
the
high
god
shall
i
come
before
him
with
burnt
offerings
with
calves
of
a
year
old
will
the
lord
be
pleased
with
thousands
of
rams
or
with
ten
thousands
of
rivers
of
oil
shall
i
give
my
firstborn
for
my
transgression
the
fruit
of
my
body
for
the
sin
of
my
soul
these
were
the
questions
which
pious
and
doubting
hearts
were
putting
to
themselves
in
the
days
of
the
prophet
the
prophet
s
own
answer
is
not
doubtful
he
hath
shewed
thee
o
man
what
is
good
and
what
doth
the
lord
require
of
thee
but
to
do
justly
and
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
with
thy
god
it
is
a
noble
answer
and
one
which
only
elect
spirits
in
that
or
perhaps
in
any
age
have
given
in
israel
the
vulgar
answer
was
given
on
bloody
altars
and
in
the
smoke
and
flames
of
tophet
and
the
form
in
which
the
prophet
s
question
is
shall
i
give
my
firstborn
for
my
transgression
plainly
on
which
of
the
children
the
duty
of
atoning
for
the
sins
of
their
father
was
supposed
to
fall
a
passage
in
ezekiel
points
no
less
clearly
to
the
same
conclusion
the
prophet
represents
god
as
saying
i
gave
them
statutes
that
were
not
good
and
judgments
wherein
they
should
not
live
and
i
polluted
them
in
their
own
gifts
in
that
they
caused
to
pass
through
the
fire
all
that
openeth
the
womb
that
i
might
make
them
that
the
writer
was
here
thinking
specially
of
the
sacrifice
of
children
is
proved
by
his
own
words
a
little
later
on
when
ye
offer
your
gifts
when
ye
make
your
sons
to
pass
through
the
fire
do
ye
pollute
yourselves
with
all
your
idols
unto
this
day
further
that
by
the
words
to
pass
through
the
fire
all
that
openeth
the
womb
he
referred
only
to
the
firstborn
can
easily
be
shewn
by
the
language
of
scripture
in
reference
to
that
law
of
the
consecration
of
firstlings
which
ezekiel
undoubtedly
had
in
his
mind
when
he
wrote
this
passage
thus
we
find
that
law
enunciated
in
the
following
terms
and
the
lord
spake
unto
moses
saying
sanctify
unto
me
all
the
firstborn
whatsoever
openeth
the
womb
among
the
children
of
israel
both
of
man
and
of
beast
it
is
again
it
is
written
thou
shalt
set
apart
unto
the
lord
all
that
openeth
the
womb
and
every
firstling
which
thou
hast
that
cometh
of
a
beast
the
males
shall
be
the
lord
once
more
all
that
openeth
the
womb
is
mine
and
all
thy
cattle
that
is
male
the
firstlings
of
ox
and
this
ancient
hebrew
custom
of
the
consecration
to
god
of
all
male
firstlings
whether
of
man
or
beast
was
merely
the
application
to
the
animal
kingdom
of
the
law
that
all
first
fruits
whatsoever
belong
to
the
deity
and
must
be
made
over
to
him
or
his
representatives
that
general
law
is
thus
stated
by
the
hebrew
legislator
thou
shalt
not
delay
to
offer
of
the
abundance
of
thy
fruits
and
of
thy
liquors
the
firstborn
of
thy
sons
shalt
thou
give
unto
me
likewise
shalt
thou
do
with
thine
oxen
and
with
thy
sheep
seven
days
it
shall
be
with
its
dam
and
on
the
eighth
day
thou
shalt
give
it
thus
the
god
of
the
hebrews
plainly
regarded
the
of
men
and
the
firstlings
of
animals
as
his
own
and
required
that
they
should
be
made
over
to
him
but
how
here
a
distinction
was
drawn
between
sheep
oxen
and
goats
on
the
one
hand
and
men
and
asses
on
the
other
the
firstlings
of
the
former
were
always
sacrificed
the
firstlings
of
the
latter
were
generally
redeemed
the
firstling
of
an
ox
or
the
firstling
of
a
sheep
or
the
firstling
of
a
goat
thou
shalt
not
redeem
they
are
holy
thou
shalt
sprinkle
their
blood
upon
the
altar
and
shalt
burn
their
fat
for
an
offering
made
by
fire
for
a
sweet
savour
unto
the
the
flesh
went
to
the
levites
who
consumed
it
no
doubt
instead
of
the
deity
whom
they
represented
on
the
other
hand
the
ass
was
not
sacrificed
by
the
israelites
probably
because
they
did
not
eat
the
animal
themselves
and
hence
concluded
that
god
did
not
do
so
either
in
the
matter
of
diet
the
taste
of
gods
generally
presents
a
striking
resemblance
to
that
of
their
worshippers
still
the
firstling
ass
like
all
other
firstlings
was
sacred
to
the
deity
and
since
it
was
not
sacrificed
to
him
he
had
to
receive
an
equivalent
for
it
in
other
words
the
ass
had
to
be
redeemed
and
the
price
of
the
redemption
was
a
lamb
which
was
burnt
as
a
vicarious
sacrifice
instead
of
the
ass
on
the
hypothesis
apparently
that
roast
lamb
is
likely
to
be
more
palatable
to
the
supreme
being
than
roast
donkey
if
the
ass
was
not
redeemed
it
had
to
be
killed
by
having
its
neck
broken
the
firstlings
of
other
unclean
animals
and
of
men
were
redeemed
for
five
shekels
a
head
which
were
paid
to
the
levites
we
can
now
readily
understand
why
so
many
of
the
hebrews
at
least
in
the
later
days
of
their
history
sacrificed
their
firstborn
children
and
why
parents
whose
affection
for
their
offspring
exceeded
their
devotion
to
the
deity
may
often
have
been
visited
with
compunction
and
even
tormented
with
feelings
of
bitter
and
shame
at
their
carnal
weakness
in
suffering
the
beloved
son
to
live
when
they
saw
others
with
an
heroic
piety
which
they
could
not
emulate
calmly
resigning
their
dear
ones
to
the
fire
through
which
as
they
firmly
believed
they
passed
to
god
to
reap
perhaps
in
endless
bliss
in
heaven
the
reward
of
their
sharp
but
transient
sufferings
on
earth
from
infancy
they
had
been
bred
up
in
the
belief
that
the
firstborn
was
sacred
to
god
and
though
they
knew
that
he
had
waived
his
right
to
them
in
consideration
of
the
receipt
of
five
shekels
a
head
they
could
hardly
view
this
as
anything
but
an
act
of
gracious
condescension
of
generous
liberality
on
the
part
of
the
divinity
who
had
stooped
to
accept
so
trifling
a
sum
instead
of
the
life
which
really
belonged
to
him
surely
they
might
argue
god
would
be
better
pleased
if
we
were
to
give
him
not
the
money
but
the
life
not
the
poor
paltry
shekels
but
what
we
value
most
our
first
and
child
if
we
hold
that
life
so
dear
will
not
he
also
it
is
his
why
should
we
not
give
him
his
own
it
was
in
answer
to
anxious
questions
such
as
these
and
to
quite
truly
conscientious
scruples
of
this
sort
that
the
prophet
micah
declared
that
what
god
required
of
his
true
worshippers
was
not
sacrifice
but
justice
and
mercy
and
humility
it
is
the
answer
of
morality
to
the
growing
consciousness
that
man
s
duty
is
not
to
propitiate
with
vain
oblations
those
mysterious
powers
of
the
universe
of
which
he
can
know
little
or
nothing
but
to
be
just
and
merciful
in
his
dealings
with
his
fellows
and
to
humbly
trust
though
he
can
not
know
that
by
acting
thus
he
will
best
please
the
higher
powers
whatever
they
may
be
but
while
morality
ranges
itself
on
the
side
of
the
prophet
it
may
be
questioned
whether
history
and
precedent
were
not
on
the
side
of
his
adversaries
if
the
firstborn
of
men
and
cattle
were
alike
sacred
to
god
and
the
firstborn
of
cattle
were
regularly
sacrificed
while
the
firstborn
of
men
were
ransomed
by
a
money
payment
has
not
this
last
provision
the
appearance
of
being
a
later
mitigation
of
an
older
and
harsher
custom
which
doomed
firstborn
children
like
firstling
lambs
and
calves
and
goats
to
the
altar
or
the
fire
the
suspicion
is
greatly
strengthened
by
the
remarkable
tradition
told
to
account
for
the
sanctity
of
the
firstborn
when
israel
was
in
bondage
in
egypt
so
runs
the
tradition
god
resolved
to
deliver
them
from
captivity
and
to
lead
them
to
the
promised
land
but
the
egyptians
were
loth
to
part
with
their
bondmen
and
thwarted
the
divine
purpose
by
refusing
to
let
the
israelites
go
accordingly
god
afflicted
these
cruel
taskmasters
with
one
plague
after
another
but
all
in
vain
until
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
resort
to
a
strong
measure
which
would
surely
have
the
desired
effect
at
dead
of
night
he
would
pass
through
the
land
killing
all
the
firstborn
of
the
egyptians
both
man
and
beast
not
one
of
them
would
be
left
alive
in
the
morning
but
the
israelites
were
warned
of
what
was
about
to
happen
and
told
to
keep
indoors
that
night
and
to
put
a
mark
on
their
houses
so
that
when
he
passed
down
the
street
on
his
errand
of
slaughter
god
might
know
them
at
sight
from
the
houses
of
the
egyptians
and
not
turn
in
and
massacre
the
wrong
children
and
animals
the
mark
was
to
be
the
blood
of
a
lamb
smeared
on
the
lintel
and
side
posts
of
the
door
in
every
house
the
lamb
whose
red
blood
was
to
be
the
badge
of
israel
that
night
as
the
white
scarves
were
the
badge
of
the
catholics
on
the
night
of
bartholomew
was
to
be
killed
at
evening
and
eaten
by
the
household
with
very
peculiar
rites
during
the
hours
of
darkness
while
the
butchery
was
proceeding
none
of
the
flesh
was
to
see
the
morning
light
whatever
the
family
could
not
eat
was
to
be
burned
with
fire
all
this
was
done
the
massacre
of
egyptian
children
and
animals
was
successfully
perpetrated
and
had
the
desired
effect
and
to
commemorate
this
great
triumph
god
ordained
that
all
the
firstborn
of
man
and
beast
among
the
israelites
should
be
sacred
to
him
ever
afterwards
in
the
manner
already
described
the
edible
animals
to
be
sacrificed
and
the
uneatable
especially
men
and
asses
to
be
ransomed
by
a
substitute
or
by
a
pecuniary
payment
of
so
much
a
head
and
a
festival
was
to
be
celebrated
every
spring
with
rites
exactly
like
those
which
were
observed
on
the
night
of
the
great
slaughter
the
divine
command
was
obeyed
and
the
festival
thus
instituted
was
the
passover
the
one
thing
that
looms
clear
through
the
haze
of
this
weird
tradition
is
the
memory
of
a
great
massacre
of
firstborn
this
was
the
origin
we
are
told
both
of
the
sanctity
of
the
firstborn
and
of
the
feast
of
the
passover
but
when
we
are
further
told
that
the
people
whose
firstborn
were
slaughtered
on
that
occasion
were
not
the
hebrews
but
their
enemies
we
are
at
once
met
by
serious
difficulties
why
we
may
ask
should
the
israelites
kill
the
firstlings
of
their
cattle
for
ever
because
god
once
killed
those
of
the
egyptians
and
why
should
every
hebrew
father
have
to
pay
god
a
ransom
for
his
firstborn
child
because
god
once
slew
all
the
firstborn
children
of
the
egyptians
in
this
form
the
tradition
offers
no
intelligible
explanation
of
the
custom
but
it
at
once
becomes
clear
and
intelligible
when
we
assume
that
in
the
original
version
of
the
story
it
was
the
hebrew
firstborn
that
were
slain
that
in
fact
the
slaughter
of
the
firstborn
children
was
formerly
what
the
slaughter
of
the
firstborn
cattle
always
continued
to
be
not
an
isolated
butchery
but
a
regular
custom
which
with
the
growth
of
more
humane
sentiments
was
afterwards
softened
into
the
vicarious
sacrifice
of
a
lamb
and
the
payment
of
a
ransom
for
each
child
here
the
reader
may
be
reminded
of
another
hebrew
tradition
in
which
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstborn
child
is
indicated
still
more
clearly
abraham
we
are
informed
was
commanded
by
god
to
offer
up
his
firstborn
son
isaac
as
a
burnt
sacrifice
and
was
on
the
point
of
obeying
the
divine
command
when
god
content
with
this
proof
of
his
faith
and
obedience
substituted
for
the
human
victim
a
ram
which
abraham
accordingly
sacrificed
instead
of
his
son
putting
the
two
traditions
together
and
observing
how
exactly
they
dovetail
into
each
other
and
into
the
later
hebrew
practice
of
actually
sacrificing
the
firstborn
children
by
fire
to
baal
or
moloch
we
can
hardly
resist
the
conclusion
that
before
the
practice
of
redeeming
them
was
introduced
the
hebrews
like
the
other
branches
of
the
semitic
race
regularly
sacrificed
their
firstborn
children
by
the
fire
or
the
knife
the
passover
if
this
view
is
right
was
the
occasion
when
the
awful
sacrifice
was
offered
and
the
tradition
of
its
origin
has
preserved
in
its
main
outlines
a
vivid
memory
of
the
horrors
of
these
fearful
nights
they
must
have
been
like
the
nights
called
evil
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
when
the
people
kept
indoors
because
the
executioners
were
going
about
the
streets
and
the
heads
of
the
human
victims
were
falling
in
the
king
s
palace
but
seen
in
the
lurid
light
of
superstition
or
of
legend
they
were
no
common
mortals
no
vulgar
executioners
who
did
the
dreadful
work
at
the
first
passover
the
angel
of
death
was
abroad
that
night
into
every
house
he
entered
and
a
sound
of
lamentation
followed
him
as
he
came
forth
with
his
dripping
sword
the
blood
that
bespattered
the
lintel
and
would
at
first
be
the
blood
of
the
firstborn
child
of
the
house
and
when
the
blood
of
a
lamb
was
afterwards
substituted
we
may
suppose
that
it
was
intended
not
so
much
to
appease
as
to
cheat
the
ghastly
visitant
seeing
the
red
drops
in
the
doorway
he
would
say
to
himself
that
is
the
blood
of
their
child
i
need
not
turn
in
there
i
have
many
yet
to
slay
before
the
morning
breaks
grey
in
the
and
he
would
pass
on
in
haste
and
the
trembling
parents
as
they
clasped
their
little
one
to
their
breast
might
fancy
that
they
heard
his
footfalls
growing
fainter
and
fainter
down
the
street
in
plain
words
we
may
surmise
that
the
slaughter
was
originally
done
by
masked
men
like
the
mumbo
jumbos
and
similar
figures
of
west
africa
who
went
from
house
to
house
and
were
believed
by
the
uninitiated
to
be
the
deity
or
his
divine
messengers
come
in
person
to
carry
off
the
victims
when
the
leaders
had
decided
to
allow
the
sacrifice
of
animals
instead
of
children
they
would
give
the
people
a
hint
that
if
they
only
killed
a
lamb
and
smeared
its
blood
on
the
the
bloodthirsty
but
deity
would
never
know
the
difference
the
attempt
to
outwit
a
malignant
and
dangerous
spirit
is
common
and
might
be
illustrated
by
many
examples
some
instances
will
be
noticed
in
a
later
part
of
this
work
here
a
single
one
may
suffice
the
malays
believe
in
a
spectral
huntsman
who
ranges
the
forest
with
a
pack
of
ghostly
dogs
and
whose
apparition
bodes
sickness
or
death
certain
birds
which
fly
in
flocks
by
night
uttering
a
loud
and
peculiar
note
are
supposed
to
follow
in
his
train
hence
when
perak
peasants
hear
the
weird
sound
they
run
out
and
make
a
clatter
with
a
knife
on
a
wooden
platter
crying
bring
us
their
hearts
the
spectral
huntsman
hearing
these
words
will
take
the
supplicants
for
followers
of
his
own
asking
to
share
his
bag
so
he
will
spare
the
household
and
pass
on
and
the
tumult
of
the
wild
hunt
will
die
away
in
the
darkness
and
the
distance
if
this
be
indeed
the
origin
of
the
passover
and
of
the
sanctity
of
the
firstborn
among
the
hebrews
the
whole
of
the
semitic
evidence
on
the
subject
is
seen
to
fall
into
line
at
once
the
children
whom
the
carthaginians
phoenicians
canaanites
moabites
sepharvites
and
probably
other
branches
of
the
semitic
race
burnt
in
the
fire
would
be
their
firstborn
only
although
in
general
ancient
writers
have
failed
to
indicate
this
limitation
of
the
custom
for
the
moabites
indeed
the
limitation
is
clearly
indicated
if
not
expressly
stated
when
we
read
that
the
king
of
moab
offered
his
eldest
son
who
should
have
reigned
after
him
as
a
burnt
sacrifice
on
the
wall
for
the
phoenicians
it
comes
out
less
distinctly
in
the
statement
of
porphyry
that
the
phoenicians
used
to
sacrifice
one
of
their
dearest
to
baal
and
in
the
legend
recorded
by
philo
of
byblus
that
cronus
sacrificed
his
son
we
may
suppose
that
the
custom
of
sacrificing
the
firstborn
both
of
men
and
animals
was
a
very
ancient
semitic
institution
which
many
branches
of
the
race
kept
up
within
historical
times
but
that
the
hebrews
while
they
maintained
the
custom
in
regard
to
domestic
cattle
were
led
by
their
loftier
morality
to
discard
it
in
respect
of
children
and
to
replace
it
by
a
merciful
law
that
firstborn
children
should
be
ransomed
instead
of
sacrificed
the
conclusion
that
the
hebrew
custom
of
redeeming
the
firstborn
is
a
modification
of
an
older
custom
of
sacrificing
them
has
been
mentioned
by
some
very
distinguished
scholars
only
to
be
rejected
on
the
ground
apparently
of
its
extreme
improbability
to
me
the
converging
lines
of
evidence
which
point
to
this
conclusion
seem
too
numerous
and
too
distinct
to
be
thus
lightly
brushed
aside
and
the
argument
from
improbability
can
easily
be
rebutted
by
pointing
to
other
peoples
who
are
known
to
have
practised
or
to
be
still
practising
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
in
some
tribes
of
new
south
wales
the
firstborn
child
of
every
woman
was
eaten
by
the
tribe
as
part
of
a
religious
ceremony
among
the
aborigines
on
the
lower
portions
of
the
paroo
and
warrego
rivers
which
join
the
darling
river
in
new
south
wales
girls
used
to
become
wives
when
they
were
mere
children
and
to
be
mothers
at
fourteen
and
the
old
custom
was
to
kill
the
firstborn
child
by
strangulation
again
among
the
tribes
about
maryborough
in
queensland
a
girl
s
first
child
was
almost
always
exposed
and
left
to
perish
in
the
tribes
about
beltana
in
south
australia
girls
were
married
at
fourteen
and
it
was
customary
to
destroy
their
firstborn
the
natives
of
rook
an
island
off
the
east
coast
of
new
guinea
used
to
kill
all
their
firstborn
children
they
prided
themselves
on
their
humanity
in
burying
the
murdered
infants
instead
of
eating
them
as
their
barbarous
neighbours
did
they
spared
the
second
child
but
killed
the
third
and
so
on
alternately
with
the
rest
of
their
offspring
chinese
history
reports
that
in
a
state
called
to
the
east
of
yueh
it
was
customary
to
devour
the
firstborn
sons
and
further
that
to
the
west
of
or
tonquin
there
was
a
realm
of
where
the
firstborn
son
was
as
a
rule
chopped
into
pieces
and
eaten
and
his
younger
brothers
were
nevertheless
regarded
to
have
fulfilled
their
fraternal
duties
towards
him
and
if
he
proved
to
be
appetizing
food
they
sent
some
of
his
flesh
to
their
chieftains
who
exhilarated
gave
the
father
a
in
india
down
to
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
custom
of
sacrificing
a
firstborn
child
to
the
ganges
was
common
again
we
are
told
that
among
the
hindoos
the
firstborn
has
always
held
a
peculiarly
sacred
position
especially
if
born
in
answer
to
a
vow
to
parents
who
have
long
been
without
offspring
in
which
case
sacrifice
of
the
child
was
common
in
india
the
mairs
used
to
sacrifice
a
firstborn
son
to
mata
the
the
borans
on
the
southern
borders
of
abyssinia
propitiate
a
called
wak
by
sacrificing
their
children
and
cattle
to
him
among
them
when
a
man
of
any
standing
marries
he
becomes
a
raba
as
it
is
called
and
for
a
certain
period
after
marriage
probably
four
to
eight
years
he
must
leave
any
children
that
are
born
to
him
to
die
in
the
bush
no
boran
cares
to
contemplate
the
fearful
calamities
with
which
wak
would
visit
him
if
he
failed
to
discharge
this
duty
after
he
ceases
to
be
a
raba
a
man
is
circumcised
and
becomes
a
gudda
the
has
no
claim
on
the
children
born
after
their
father
s
circumcision
but
they
are
sent
away
at
a
very
early
age
to
be
reared
by
the
wata
a
low
caste
of
hunters
they
remain
with
these
people
till
they
are
grown
up
and
then
return
to
their
families
in
this
remarkable
custom
it
would
appear
that
the
circumcision
of
the
father
is
regarded
as
an
atoning
sacrifice
which
redeems
the
rest
of
his
children
from
the
spirit
to
whom
they
would
otherwise
belong
the
obscure
story
told
by
the
israelites
to
explain
the
origin
of
circumcision
seems
also
to
suggest
that
the
custom
was
supposed
to
save
the
life
of
the
child
by
giving
the
deity
a
substitute
for
it
again
the
kerre
banna
and
bashada
three
tribes
in
the
valley
of
the
omo
river
to
the
south
of
abyssinia
are
in
the
habit
of
strangling
their
firstborn
children
and
throwing
the
bodies
away
the
kerre
cast
the
bodies
into
the
river
omo
where
they
are
devoured
by
crocodiles
the
other
two
tribes
leave
them
in
the
forest
to
be
eaten
by
the
hyaenas
the
only
explanation
they
give
of
the
custom
is
that
it
was
decreed
by
their
ancestors
captain
stigand
enquired
into
the
practice
very
carefully
and
was
told
that
for
a
certain
number
of
years
after
marriage
children
would
be
thrown
away
and
after
that
they
would
be
kept
the
number
of
the
first
children
who
were
strangled
and
the
period
of
years
during
which
this
was
done
appears
to
be
variable
but
i
could
not
understand
what
regulated
it
there
was
one
point
however
about
which
they
were
certain
and
that
was
that
the
of
all
rich
poor
high
and
low
had
to
be
strangled
and
thrown
away
the
chief
of
the
kerre
said
if
i
had
a
child
now
it
would
have
to
be
thrown
away
laughing
as
if
it
were
a
great
joke
what
amused
him
really
was
that
i
should
be
so
interested
in
their
so
far
as
captain
stigand
could
ascertain
there
is
no
idea
of
sacrificing
the
children
to
the
crocodiles
by
throwing
them
into
the
river
if
a
kerre
man
has
a
first
child
born
to
him
while
he
is
on
a
journey
away
from
the
river
he
will
throw
the
infant
away
in
the
forest
in
uganda
if
the
firstborn
child
of
a
chief
or
any
important
person
is
a
son
the
midwife
strangles
it
and
reports
that
the
infant
was
this
is
done
to
ensure
the
life
of
the
father
if
he
has
a
son
born
first
he
will
soon
die
and
the
child
inherit
all
he
amongst
the
people
of
senjero
in
eastern
africa
we
are
told
that
many
families
must
offer
up
their
firstborn
sons
as
sacrifices
because
once
upon
a
time
when
summer
and
winter
were
jumbled
together
in
a
bad
season
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
would
not
ripen
the
soothsayers
enjoined
it
at
that
time
a
great
pillar
of
iron
is
said
to
have
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
capital
which
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
the
soothsayers
was
broken
down
by
order
of
the
king
whereupon
the
seasons
became
regular
again
to
avert
the
recurrence
of
such
a
calamity
the
wizards
commanded
the
king
to
pour
human
blood
once
a
year
on
the
base
of
the
broken
shaft
of
the
pillar
and
also
upon
the
throne
since
then
certain
families
have
been
obliged
to
deliver
up
their
firstborn
sons
who
were
sacrificed
at
an
appointed
time
among
some
tribes
of
africa
there
is
a
rule
that
when
a
woman
s
husband
has
been
killed
in
battle
and
she
marries
again
the
first
child
she
gives
birth
to
after
her
second
marriage
must
be
put
to
death
whether
she
has
it
by
her
first
or
her
second
husband
such
a
child
is
called
the
child
of
the
assegai
and
if
it
were
not
killed
death
or
an
accident
would
be
sure
to
befall
the
second
spouse
and
the
woman
herself
would
be
barren
the
notion
is
that
the
woman
must
have
had
some
share
in
the
misfortune
that
overtook
her
first
husband
and
that
the
only
way
of
removing
the
malign
influence
is
to
slay
the
child
of
the
the
heathen
russians
often
sacrificed
their
firstborn
to
the
god
perun
it
is
said
that
on
mag
slacht
or
plain
of
prostrations
near
the
present
village
of
ballymagauran
in
the
county
cavan
there
used
to
stand
a
great
idol
called
cromm
cruach
covered
with
gold
to
which
the
ancient
irish
sacrificed
the
firstlings
of
every
issue
and
the
chief
scions
of
every
clan
in
order
to
obtain
plenty
of
corn
honey
and
milk
round
about
the
golden
image
which
was
spoken
of
as
the
king
idol
of
erin
stood
twelve
other
idols
of
stone
the
kutonaqa
indians
of
british
columbia
worship
the
sun
and
sacrifice
their
firstborn
children
to
him
when
a
woman
is
with
child
she
prays
to
the
sun
saying
i
am
with
child
when
it
is
born
i
shall
offer
it
to
you
have
pity
upon
thus
they
expect
to
secure
health
and
good
fortune
for
their
families
among
the
coast
salish
indians
of
the
same
region
the
first
child
is
often
sacrificed
to
the
sun
in
order
to
ensure
the
health
and
prosperity
of
the
whole
family
the
indians
of
florida
sacrificed
their
firstborn
male
children
among
the
indians
of
north
carolina
down
to
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
remarkable
ceremony
was
performed
which
seems
to
be
most
naturally
interpreted
as
a
modification
of
an
older
custom
of
putting
the
king
s
son
to
death
perhaps
as
a
substitute
for
his
father
it
is
thus
described
by
a
writer
of
that
period
they
have
a
strange
custom
or
ceremony
amongst
them
to
call
to
mind
the
persecutions
and
death
of
the
kings
their
ancestors
slain
by
their
enemies
at
certain
seasons
and
particularly
when
the
savages
have
been
at
war
with
any
nation
and
return
from
their
country
without
bringing
home
some
prisoners
of
war
or
the
heads
of
their
enemies
the
king
causes
as
a
perpetual
remembrance
of
all
his
predecessors
to
beat
and
wound
the
best
beloved
of
all
his
children
with
the
same
weapons
wherewith
they
had
been
kill
d
in
former
times
to
the
end
that
by
renewing
the
wound
their
death
should
be
lamented
afresh
the
king
and
his
nation
being
assembled
on
these
occasions
a
feast
is
prepared
and
the
indian
who
is
authorised
to
wound
the
king
s
son
runs
about
the
house
like
a
distracted
person
crying
and
making
a
most
hideous
noise
all
the
time
with
the
weapon
in
his
hand
wherewith
he
wounds
the
king
s
son
this
he
performs
three
several
times
during
which
interval
he
presents
the
king
with
victuals
or
and
it
is
very
strange
to
see
the
indian
that
is
thus
struck
never
offers
to
stir
till
he
is
wounded
the
third
time
after
which
he
falls
down
backwards
stretching
out
his
arms
and
legs
as
if
he
had
been
ready
to
expire
then
the
rest
of
the
king
s
sons
and
daughters
together
with
the
mother
and
vast
numbers
of
women
and
girls
fall
at
his
feet
and
lament
and
cry
most
bitterly
during
this
time
the
king
and
his
retinue
are
feasting
yet
with
such
profound
silence
for
some
hours
that
not
one
word
or
even
a
whisper
is
to
be
heard
amongst
them
after
this
manner
they
continue
till
night
which
ends
in
singing
dancing
and
the
greatest
joy
in
this
account
the
description
of
the
frantic
manner
assumed
by
the
person
whose
duty
it
was
to
wound
the
king
s
son
reminds
us
of
the
frenzy
of
king
athamas
when
he
took
or
attempted
the
lives
of
his
children
the
same
feature
is
said
to
have
characterised
the
sacrifice
of
children
in
peru
when
any
person
of
note
was
sick
and
the
priest
said
he
must
die
they
sacrificed
his
son
desiring
the
idol
to
be
satisfied
with
him
and
not
to
take
away
his
father
s
life
the
ceremonies
used
at
these
sacrifices
were
strange
for
they
behaved
themselves
like
mad
men
they
believed
that
all
calamities
were
occasioned
by
sin
and
that
sacrifices
were
the
an
early
spanish
historian
of
the
conquest
of
peru
in
describing
the
indians
of
the
peruvian
valleys
between
and
caxamalca
records
that
they
have
disgusting
sacrifices
and
temples
of
idols
which
they
hold
in
great
veneration
they
offer
them
their
most
precious
possessions
every
month
they
sacrifice
their
own
children
and
smear
with
the
blood
of
the
victims
the
face
of
the
idols
and
the
doors
of
the
in
puruha
a
province
of
quito
it
used
to
be
customary
to
sacrifice
the
firstborn
children
to
the
gods
their
remains
were
dried
enclosed
in
vessels
of
metal
or
stone
and
kept
in
the
houses
the
ximanas
and
cauxanas
two
indian
tribes
in
the
upper
valley
of
the
amazon
kill
all
their
firstborn
children
if
the
firstborn
is
a
girl
the
lengua
indians
invariably
put
it
to
death
among
the
ancient
italian
peoples
especially
of
the
sabine
stock
it
was
customary
in
seasons
of
great
peril
or
public
calamity
as
when
the
crops
had
failed
or
a
pestilence
was
raging
to
vow
that
they
would
sacrifice
to
the
gods
every
creature
whether
man
or
beast
that
should
be
born
in
the
following
spring
to
the
creatures
thus
devoted
to
sacrifice
the
name
of
the
sacred
spring
was
applied
but
since
says
festus
it
seemed
cruel
to
slay
innocent
boys
and
girls
they
were
kept
till
they
had
grown
up
then
veiled
and
driven
beyond
the
several
italian
peoples
for
example
the
piceni
samnites
and
hirpini
traced
their
origin
to
a
sacred
spring
that
is
to
the
consecrated
youth
who
had
swarmed
off
from
the
parent
stock
in
consequence
of
such
a
vow
when
the
romans
were
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
hannibal
after
their
great
defeat
at
the
trasimene
lake
they
vowed
to
offer
a
sacred
spring
if
victory
should
attend
their
arms
and
the
commonwealth
should
retrieve
its
shattered
fortunes
but
the
vow
extended
only
to
all
the
offspring
of
sheep
goats
oxen
and
swine
that
should
be
brought
forth
on
italian
mountains
plains
and
meadows
the
following
spring
on
a
later
occasion
when
the
romans
pledged
themselves
again
by
a
similar
vow
it
was
decided
that
by
the
sacred
spring
should
be
meant
all
the
cattle
born
between
the
first
day
of
march
and
the
last
day
of
april
although
in
later
times
the
italian
peoples
appear
to
have
resorted
to
measures
of
this
sort
only
in
special
emergencies
there
was
a
tradition
that
in
former
times
the
consecration
of
the
firstborn
to
the
gods
had
been
an
annual
custom
accordingly
it
seems
not
impossible
that
originally
the
italians
may
like
the
hebrews
and
perhaps
the
semites
in
general
have
been
in
the
habit
of
dedicating
all
the
firstborn
whether
of
man
or
beast
and
sacrificing
them
at
a
great
festival
in
spring
the
custom
of
the
sacred
spring
was
not
confined
to
the
italians
but
was
practised
by
many
other
peoples
both
greeks
and
barbarians
in
antiquity
thus
it
would
seem
that
a
custom
of
putting
to
death
all
firstborn
children
has
prevailed
in
many
parts
of
the
world
what
was
the
motive
which
led
people
to
practise
a
custom
which
to
us
seems
at
once
so
cruel
and
so
foolish
it
can
not
have
been
the
purely
prudential
consideration
of
adjusting
the
numbers
of
the
tribe
to
the
amount
of
the
for
in
the
first
place
savages
do
not
take
such
thought
for
the
morrow
and
in
the
second
place
if
they
did
they
would
be
likely
to
kill
the
later
born
children
rather
than
the
firstborn
the
foregoing
evidence
suggests
that
the
custom
may
have
been
practised
by
different
peoples
from
different
motives
with
the
semites
the
italians
and
their
near
kinsmen
the
irish
the
sacrifice
or
at
least
the
consecration
of
the
firstborn
seems
to
have
been
viewed
as
a
tribute
paid
to
the
gods
who
were
thus
content
to
receive
a
part
though
they
might
justly
have
claimed
the
whole
in
some
cases
the
death
of
the
child
appears
to
be
definitely
regarded
as
a
substitute
for
the
death
of
the
father
who
obtains
a
new
lease
of
life
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
offspring
this
comes
out
clearly
in
the
tradition
of
aun
king
of
sweden
who
sacrificed
one
of
his
sons
every
nine
years
to
odin
in
order
to
prolong
his
own
life
and
in
peru
also
the
son
died
that
the
father
might
live
but
in
some
cases
it
would
seem
that
the
child
has
been
killed
not
so
much
as
a
substitute
for
the
father
as
because
it
is
supposed
to
endanger
his
life
by
absorbing
his
spiritual
essence
or
vital
energy
in
fact
a
belief
in
the
transmigration
or
rebirth
of
souls
has
operated
to
produce
a
regular
custom
of
infanticide
especially
infanticide
of
the
firstborn
at
whydah
on
the
slave
coast
of
west
africa
where
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
is
firmly
held
it
has
happened
that
a
child
has
been
put
to
death
because
the
fetish
doctors
declared
it
to
be
the
king
s
father
come
to
life
again
the
king
naturally
could
not
submit
to
be
pushed
from
the
throne
by
his
predecessor
in
this
fashion
so
he
compelled
his
supposed
parent
to
return
to
the
world
of
the
dead
from
which
he
had
very
inopportunely
effected
his
escape
the
hindoos
are
of
opinion
that
a
man
is
literally
reborn
in
the
person
of
his
son
thus
in
the
of
we
read
that
the
husband
after
conception
by
his
wife
becomes
an
embryo
and
is
born
again
of
her
for
that
is
the
wifehood
of
a
wife
that
he
is
born
again
by
hence
after
the
birth
of
a
son
the
father
is
clearly
in
a
very
delicate
position
since
he
is
his
own
son
can
he
himself
apart
from
his
son
be
said
to
exist
does
he
not
rather
die
in
his
own
person
as
soon
as
he
comes
to
life
in
the
person
of
his
son
this
appears
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
subtle
hindoo
for
in
some
sections
of
the
khatris
a
mercantile
caste
of
the
punjaub
funeral
rites
are
actually
performed
for
the
father
in
the
fifth
month
of
his
wife
s
pregnancy
but
apparently
he
is
allowed
by
a
sort
of
legal
fiction
to
come
to
life
again
in
his
own
person
for
after
the
birth
of
his
first
son
he
is
formally
remarried
to
his
wife
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
tacit
admission
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law
at
least
he
is
alive
now
to
people
who
thus
conceive
the
relation
of
father
and
son
it
is
plain
that
fatherhood
must
appear
a
very
dubious
privilege
for
if
you
die
in
begetting
a
son
can
you
be
quite
sure
of
coming
to
life
again
his
existence
is
at
the
best
a
menace
to
yours
and
at
the
worst
it
may
involve
your
extinction
the
danger
seems
to
lie
especially
in
the
birth
of
your
first
son
if
only
you
can
tide
that
over
you
are
humanly
speaking
safe
in
fact
it
comes
to
this
are
you
to
live
or
is
he
it
is
a
painful
dilemma
parental
affection
urges
you
to
die
that
he
may
live
whispers
live
and
let
him
die
you
are
in
the
flower
of
your
age
you
adorn
the
circle
in
which
you
move
you
are
useful
nay
indispensable
to
society
he
is
a
mere
babe
he
never
will
be
such
a
train
of
thought
preposterous
as
it
seems
to
us
might
easily
lead
to
a
custom
of
killing
the
firstborn
further
the
same
notion
of
the
rebirth
of
the
father
in
his
eldest
son
would
explain
the
remarkable
rule
of
succession
which
prevailed
in
polynesia
and
particularly
in
tahiti
where
as
soon
as
the
king
had
a
son
born
to
him
he
was
obliged
to
abdicate
the
throne
in
favour
of
the
infant
whatever
might
be
the
king
s
age
his
influence
in
the
state
or
the
political
situation
of
affairs
no
sooner
was
the
child
born
than
the
monarch
became
a
subject
the
infant
was
at
once
proclaimed
the
sovereign
of
the
people
the
royal
name
was
conferred
upon
him
and
his
father
was
the
first
to
do
him
homage
by
saluting
his
feet
and
declaring
him
king
all
matters
however
of
importance
which
concerned
either
the
internal
welfare
or
the
foreign
relations
of
the
country
continued
to
be
transacted
by
the
father
and
his
councillors
but
every
edict
was
issued
in
the
name
and
on
the
behalf
of
the
youthful
monarch
and
though
the
whole
of
the
executive
government
might
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
father
he
only
acted
as
regent
for
his
son
and
was
regarded
as
such
by
the
nation
the
lands
and
other
sources
of
revenue
were
appropriated
to
the
maintenance
of
the
infant
ruler
his
household
and
his
attendants
the
insignia
of
royal
authority
were
transferred
to
him
and
his
father
rendered
him
all
those
marks
of
humble
respect
which
he
had
hitherto
exacted
from
his
subjects
this
custom
of
succession
was
not
confined
to
the
family
of
the
sovereign
it
extended
also
to
the
nobles
and
the
landed
gentry
they
too
had
to
resign
their
rank
honours
and
possessions
on
the
birth
of
a
son
a
man
who
but
yesterday
was
a
baron
not
to
be
approached
by
his
inferiors
till
they
had
ceremoniously
bared
the
whole
of
the
upper
part
of
their
bodies
was
reduced
to
the
rank
of
a
mere
commoner
with
none
to
do
him
reverence
if
in
the
night
time
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
a
son
and
the
child
had
been
suffered
to
live
the
father
indeed
still
continued
to
administer
the
estate
but
he
did
so
for
the
benefit
of
the
infant
to
whom
it
now
belonged
and
to
whom
all
the
marks
of
respect
were
at
once
transferred
this
singular
usage
becomes
intelligible
if
the
spirit
of
the
father
was
supposed
to
quit
him
at
the
birth
of
his
first
son
and
to
reappear
in
the
infant
such
a
belief
and
such
a
practice
would
it
is
obvious
supply
a
powerful
motive
to
infanticide
since
a
father
could
not
rear
his
firstborn
son
without
thereby
relinquishing
the
honours
and
possessions
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
the
sacrifice
was
a
heavy
one
and
we
need
not
wonder
if
many
men
refused
to
make
it
certainly
infanticide
was
practised
in
polynesia
to
an
extraordinary
extent
the
first
missionaries
estimated
that
not
less
than
of
the
children
were
murdered
by
their
parents
and
this
estimate
has
been
confirmed
by
a
careful
enquirer
it
would
seem
that
before
the
introduction
of
christianity
there
was
not
a
single
mother
in
the
islands
who
was
not
also
a
murderess
having
imbrued
her
hands
in
the
blood
of
her
offspring
three
native
women
the
eldest
not
more
than
forty
years
of
age
happened
once
to
be
in
a
room
where
the
conversation
turned
on
infanticide
and
they
confessed
to
having
destroyed
not
less
than
infants
between
them
it
would
doubtless
be
a
gross
mistake
to
lay
the
whole
blame
of
these
massacres
on
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
but
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
it
instigated
a
great
many
once
more
we
perceive
the
fatal
consequences
that
may
flow
in
practice
from
a
theoretical
error
in
some
places
the
abdication
of
the
father
does
not
take
place
until
the
son
is
grown
up
this
was
the
general
practice
in
fiji
in
raratonga
as
soon
as
a
son
reached
manhood
he
would
fight
and
wrestle
with
his
father
for
the
mastery
and
if
he
obtained
it
he
would
take
forcible
possession
of
the
farm
and
drive
his
parent
in
destitution
from
home
among
the
corannas
of
south
africa
the
youthful
son
of
a
chief
is
hardly
allowed
to
walk
but
has
to
idle
away
his
time
in
the
hut
and
to
drink
much
milk
in
order
that
he
may
grow
strong
when
he
has
attained
to
manhood
his
father
produces
two
short
sticks
and
presents
one
to
his
son
while
he
keeps
the
other
for
himself
armed
with
these
weapons
the
two
often
fight
and
when
the
son
succeeds
in
knocking
his
parent
down
he
is
acknowledged
chief
of
the
kraal
but
such
customs
probably
do
not
imply
the
theory
of
rebirth
they
may
only
be
applications
of
the
principle
that
might
is
right
still
they
would
equally
supply
the
father
with
a
motive
for
killing
the
infant
son
who
if
suffered
to
live
would
one
day
strip
him
of
his
rank
and
possessions
perhaps
customs
of
this
sort
have
left
traces
of
themselves
in
greek
myth
and
legend
cronus
or
saturn
as
the
romans
called
him
is
said
to
have
been
the
youngest
son
of
the
uranus
and
to
have
mutilated
his
father
and
reigned
in
his
stead
as
king
of
gods
and
men
afterwards
he
was
warned
by
an
oracle
that
he
himself
should
be
deposed
by
his
son
to
prevent
that
catastrophe
cronus
swallowed
his
children
one
after
the
other
as
soon
as
they
were
born
only
the
youngest
of
them
zeus
was
saved
through
a
trick
of
his
mother
s
and
in
time
he
fulfilled
the
oracle
by
banishing
his
father
and
sitting
on
his
throne
but
zeus
in
his
turn
was
told
that
his
wife
metis
would
give
birth
to
a
son
who
would
supplant
him
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
accordingly
to
rid
himself
of
his
future
rival
he
resorted
to
a
device
like
that
which
his
father
cronus
had
employed
for
a
similar
purpose
only
instead
of
waiting
till
the
child
was
born
and
then
devouring
it
he
made
assurance
doubly
sure
by
swallowing
his
wife
with
the
unborn
babe
in
her
womb
such
barbarous
myths
become
intelligible
if
we
suppose
that
they
took
their
rise
among
people
who
were
accustomed
to
see
sons
supplanting
their
fathers
by
force
and
fathers
murdering
and
perhaps
eating
their
infants
in
order
to
secure
themselves
against
their
future
rivalry
we
have
met
with
instances
of
savage
tribes
who
are
said
to
devour
their
firstborn
children
the
legend
that
laius
king
of
thebes
exposed
his
infant
son
oedipus
who
afterwards
slew
his
father
and
sat
on
the
throne
may
well
be
a
reminiscence
of
a
state
of
things
in
which
father
and
son
regularly
plotted
against
each
other
the
other
feature
of
the
story
to
wit
the
marriage
of
oedipus
with
the
widowed
queen
his
mother
fits
in
very
well
with
the
rule
which
has
prevailed
in
some
countries
that
a
valid
title
to
the
throne
is
conferred
by
marriage
with
the
late
king
s
widow
that
custom
probably
arose
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
shew
in
an
age
when
the
ran
in
the
female
line
and
when
the
king
was
a
man
of
another
family
often
a
stranger
and
foreigner
who
reigned
only
in
virtue
of
being
the
consort
of
a
native
princess
and
whose
sons
never
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
but
in
process
of
time
when
fathers
had
ceased
to
regard
the
birth
of
a
son
as
a
menace
to
their
life
or
at
least
to
their
regal
power
kings
would
naturally
scheme
to
secure
the
succession
for
their
own
male
offspring
and
this
new
practice
could
be
reconciled
with
the
old
one
by
marrying
the
king
s
son
either
to
his
own
sister
or
after
his
father
s
decease
to
his
stepmother
we
have
seen
marriage
with
a
stepmother
actually
enjoined
for
this
very
purpose
by
some
of
the
saxon
kings
and
on
this
hypothesis
we
can
understand
why
the
custom
of
marriage
with
a
full
or
a
half
sister
has
prevailed
in
so
many
royal
families
it
was
introduced
we
may
suppose
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
king
s
son
the
right
of
succession
hitherto
enjoyed
under
a
system
of
female
kinship
either
by
the
son
of
the
king
s
sister
or
by
the
husband
of
the
king
s
daughter
for
under
the
new
rule
the
heir
to
the
throne
united
both
these
characters
being
at
once
the
son
of
the
king
s
sister
and
through
marriage
with
his
own
sister
the
husband
of
the
king
s
daughter
thus
the
custom
of
brother
and
sister
marriage
in
royal
houses
marks
a
transition
from
female
to
male
descent
of
the
crown
in
this
connexion
it
may
be
significant
that
cronus
and
zeus
themselves
married
their
full
sisters
rhea
and
hera
a
tradition
which
naturally
proved
a
stone
of
stumbling
to
generations
who
had
forgotten
the
ancient
rule
of
policy
which
dictated
such
incestuous
unions
and
who
had
so
far
inverted
the
true
relations
of
gods
and
men
as
to
expect
their
deities
to
be
edifying
models
of
the
new
virtues
instead
of
warning
examples
of
the
old
vices
they
failed
to
understand
that
men
create
their
gods
in
their
own
likeness
and
that
when
the
creator
is
a
savage
his
creatures
the
gods
are
savages
also
with
the
preceding
evidence
before
us
we
may
safely
infer
that
a
custom
of
allowing
a
king
to
kill
his
son
as
a
substitute
or
vicarious
sacrifice
for
himself
would
be
in
no
way
exceptional
or
surprising
at
least
in
semitic
lands
where
indeed
religion
seems
at
one
time
to
have
recommended
or
enjoined
every
man
as
a
duty
that
he
owed
to
his
god
to
take
the
life
of
his
eldest
son
and
it
would
be
entirely
in
accordance
with
analogy
if
long
after
the
barbarous
custom
had
been
dropped
by
others
it
continued
to
be
observed
by
kings
who
remain
in
many
respects
the
representatives
of
a
vanished
world
solitary
pinnacles
that
topple
over
the
rising
waste
of
waters
under
which
the
past
lies
buried
we
have
seen
that
in
greece
two
families
of
royal
descent
remained
liable
to
furnish
human
victims
from
their
number
down
to
a
time
when
the
rest
of
their
fellow
countrymen
and
countrywomen
ran
hardly
more
risk
of
being
sacrificed
than
passengers
in
cheapside
at
present
run
of
being
hurried
into
paul
s
or
bow
church
and
immolated
on
the
altar
a
final
mitigation
of
the
custom
would
be
to
substitute
condemned
criminals
for
innocent
victims
such
a
substitution
is
known
to
have
taken
place
in
the
human
sacrifices
annually
offered
in
rhodes
to
baal
and
we
have
seen
good
grounds
for
believing
that
the
criminal
who
perished
on
the
cross
or
the
gallows
at
babylon
died
instead
of
the
king
in
whose
royal
robes
he
had
been
allowed
to
masquerade
for
a
few
days
chapter
vii
succession
to
the
soul
to
the
view
that
in
early
times
and
among
barbarous
races
kings
have
frequently
been
put
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
short
reign
it
may
be
objected
that
such
a
custom
would
tend
to
the
extinction
of
the
royal
family
the
objection
may
be
met
by
observing
first
that
the
kingship
is
often
not
confined
to
one
family
but
may
be
shared
in
turn
by
several
second
that
the
office
is
frequently
not
hereditary
but
is
open
to
men
of
any
family
even
to
foreigners
who
may
fulfil
the
requisite
conditions
such
as
marrying
a
princess
or
vanquishing
the
king
in
battle
and
third
that
even
if
the
custom
did
tend
to
the
extinction
of
a
dynasty
that
is
not
a
consideration
which
would
prevent
its
observance
among
people
less
provident
of
the
future
and
less
heedful
of
human
life
than
ourselves
many
races
like
many
individuals
have
indulged
in
practices
which
must
in
the
end
destroy
them
not
to
mention
such
customs
as
collective
suicide
and
the
prohibition
of
marriage
both
of
which
may
be
set
down
to
religious
mania
we
have
seen
that
the
polynesians
killed
of
their
children
in
some
parts
of
east
africa
the
proportion
of
infants
massacred
at
birth
is
said
to
be
the
same
only
children
born
in
certain
presentations
are
allowed
to
live
the
jagas
a
conquering
tribe
in
angola
are
reported
to
have
put
to
death
all
their
children
without
exception
in
order
that
the
women
might
not
be
cumbered
with
babies
on
the
march
they
recruited
their
numbers
by
adopting
boys
and
girls
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
whose
parents
they
had
killed
and
eaten
among
the
mbaya
indians
of
south
america
the
women
used
to
murder
all
their
children
except
the
last
or
the
one
they
believed
to
be
the
last
if
one
of
them
had
another
child
afterwards
she
killed
it
we
need
not
wonder
that
this
practice
entirely
destroyed
a
branch
of
the
mbaya
nation
who
had
been
for
many
years
the
most
formidable
enemies
of
the
spaniards
among
the
lengua
indians
of
the
gran
chaco
the
missionaries
discovered
what
they
describe
as
a
carefully
planned
system
of
racial
suicide
by
the
practice
of
infanticide
by
abortion
and
other
nor
is
infanticide
the
only
mode
in
which
a
savage
tribe
commits
suicide
a
lavish
use
of
the
poison
ordeal
may
be
equally
effective
some
time
ago
a
small
tribe
named
uwet
came
down
from
the
hill
country
and
settled
on
the
left
branch
of
the
calabar
river
in
west
africa
when
the
missionaries
first
visited
the
place
they
found
the
population
considerable
distributed
into
three
villages
since
then
the
constant
use
of
the
poison
ordeal
has
almost
extinguished
the
tribe
on
one
occasion
the
whole
population
took
poison
to
prove
their
innocence
about
half
perished
on
the
spot
and
the
remnant
we
are
told
still
continuing
their
superstitious
practice
must
soon
become
extinct
with
such
examples
before
us
we
need
not
hesitate
to
believe
that
many
tribes
have
felt
no
scruple
or
delicacy
in
observing
a
custom
which
tends
to
wipe
out
a
single
family
to
attribute
such
scruples
to
them
is
to
commit
the
common
the
perpetually
repeated
mistake
of
judging
the
savage
by
the
standard
of
european
civilisation
if
any
of
my
readers
set
out
with
the
notion
that
all
races
of
men
think
and
act
much
in
the
same
way
as
educated
englishmen
the
evidence
of
superstitious
belief
and
custom
collected
in
the
volumes
of
this
work
should
suffice
to
disabuse
him
of
so
erroneous
a
prepossession
the
explanation
here
given
of
the
custom
of
killing
divine
persons
assumes
or
at
least
is
readily
combined
with
the
idea
that
the
soul
of
the
slain
divinity
is
transmitted
to
his
successor
of
this
transmission
i
have
no
direct
proof
except
in
the
case
of
the
shilluk
among
whom
the
practice
of
killing
the
divine
king
prevails
in
a
typical
form
and
with
whom
it
is
a
fundamental
article
of
faith
that
the
soul
of
the
divine
founder
of
the
dynasty
is
immanent
in
every
one
of
his
slain
successors
but
if
this
is
the
only
actual
example
of
such
a
belief
which
i
can
adduce
analogy
seems
to
render
it
probable
that
a
similar
succession
to
the
soul
of
the
slain
god
has
been
supposed
to
take
place
in
other
instances
though
direct
evidence
of
it
is
wanting
for
it
has
been
already
shewn
that
the
soul
of
the
incarnate
deity
is
often
supposed
to
transmigrate
at
death
into
another
incarnation
and
if
this
takes
place
when
the
death
is
a
natural
one
there
seems
no
reason
why
it
should
not
take
place
when
the
death
has
been
brought
about
by
violence
certainly
the
idea
that
the
soul
of
a
dying
person
may
be
transmitted
to
his
successor
is
perfectly
familiar
to
primitive
peoples
in
nias
the
eldest
son
usually
succeeds
his
father
in
the
chieftainship
but
if
from
any
bodily
or
mental
defect
the
eldest
son
is
disqualified
for
ruling
the
father
determines
in
his
lifetime
which
of
his
sons
shall
succeed
him
in
order
however
to
establish
his
right
of
succession
it
is
necessary
that
the
son
upon
whom
his
father
s
choice
falls
shall
catch
in
his
mouth
or
in
a
bag
the
last
breath
and
with
it
the
soul
of
the
dying
chief
for
whoever
catches
his
last
breath
is
chief
equally
with
the
appointed
successor
hence
the
other
brothers
and
sometimes
also
strangers
crowd
round
the
dying
man
to
catch
his
soul
as
it
passes
the
houses
in
nias
are
raised
above
the
ground
on
posts
and
it
has
happened
that
when
the
dying
man
lay
with
his
face
on
the
floor
one
of
the
candidates
has
bored
a
hole
in
the
floor
and
sucked
in
the
chief
s
last
breath
through
a
bamboo
tube
when
the
chief
has
no
son
his
soul
is
caught
in
a
bag
which
is
fastened
to
an
image
made
to
represent
the
deceased
the
soul
is
then
believed
to
pass
into
the
image
amongst
the
takilis
or
carrier
indians
of
america
when
a
corpse
was
burned
the
priest
pretended
to
catch
the
soul
of
the
deceased
in
his
hands
which
he
closed
with
many
gesticulations
he
then
communicated
the
captured
soul
to
the
dead
man
s
successor
by
throwing
his
hands
towards
and
blowing
upon
him
the
person
to
whom
the
soul
was
thus
communicated
took
the
name
and
rank
of
the
deceased
on
the
death
of
a
chief
the
priest
thus
filled
a
responsible
and
influential
position
for
he
might
transmit
the
soul
to
whom
he
would
though
doubtless
he
generally
followed
the
regular
line
of
succession
in
guatemala
when
a
great
man
lay
at
the
point
of
death
they
put
a
precious
stone
between
his
lips
to
receive
the
parting
soul
and
this
was
afterwards
kept
as
a
memorial
by
his
nearest
kinsman
or
most
intimate
friend
algonquin
women
who
wished
to
become
mothers
flocked
to
the
side
of
a
dying
person
in
the
hope
of
receiving
and
being
impregnated
by
the
passing
soul
amongst
the
seminoles
of
florida
when
a
woman
died
in
childbed
the
infant
was
held
over
her
face
to
receive
her
parting
spirit
when
infants
died
within
a
month
or
two
of
birth
the
huron
indians
did
not
lay
them
in
bark
coffins
on
poles
as
they
did
with
other
corpses
but
buried
them
beside
the
paths
in
order
that
they
might
secretly
enter
into
the
wombs
of
passing
women
and
be
born
again
the
tonquinese
cover
the
face
of
a
dying
person
with
a
handkerchief
and
at
the
moment
when
he
breathes
his
last
they
fold
up
the
handkerchief
carefully
thinking
that
they
have
caught
the
soul
in
it
the
romans
caught
the
breath
of
dying
friends
in
their
mouths
and
so
received
into
themselves
the
soul
of
the
departed
the
same
custom
is
said
to
be
still
practised
in
lancashire
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
death
of
a
king
of
gingiro
the
sorcerers
bring
to
his
successor
wrapt
in
a
piece
of
silk
a
worm
which
they
say
comes
from
the
nose
of
the
dead
king
and
they
make
the
new
king
kill
the
worm
by
squeezing
its
head
between
his
teeth
the
ceremony
seems
to
be
intended
to
convey
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
monarch
to
his
successor
the
danakil
or
afars
of
eastern
africa
believe
that
the
soul
of
a
magician
will
be
born
again
in
the
first
male
descendant
of
the
man
who
was
most
active
in
attending
on
the
dying
magician
in
his
last
hours
hence
when
a
magician
is
ill
he
receives
many
attentions
in
uganda
the
spirit
of
the
king
who
had
been
the
last
to
die
manifested
itself
from
time
to
time
in
the
person
of
a
priest
who
was
prepared
for
the
discharge
of
this
exalted
function
by
a
peculiar
ceremony
when
the
body
of
the
king
had
been
embalmed
and
had
lain
for
five
months
in
the
tomb
which
was
a
house
built
specially
for
it
the
head
was
severed
from
the
body
and
laid
in
an
having
been
stript
of
flesh
by
the
insects
the
skull
was
washed
in
a
particular
river
the
ndyabuworu
and
filled
with
native
beer
one
of
the
late
king
s
priests
then
drank
the
beer
out
of
the
skull
and
thus
became
himself
a
vessel
meet
to
receive
the
spirit
of
the
deceased
monarch
the
skull
was
afterwards
replaced
in
the
tomb
but
the
lower
jaw
was
separated
from
it
and
deposited
in
a
jar
and
this
jar
being
swathed
in
and
decorated
with
beads
so
as
to
look
like
a
man
henceforth
represented
the
late
king
a
house
was
built
for
its
reception
in
the
shape
of
a
beehive
and
divided
into
two
rooms
an
inner
and
an
outer
any
person
might
enter
the
outer
room
but
in
the
inner
room
the
spirit
of
the
dead
king
was
supposed
to
dwell
in
front
of
the
partition
was
set
a
throne
covered
with
lion
and
leopard
skins
and
fenced
off
from
the
rest
of
the
chamber
by
a
rail
of
spears
shields
and
knives
most
of
them
made
of
copper
and
brass
and
beautifully
worked
when
the
priest
who
had
fitted
himself
to
receive
the
king
s
spirit
desired
to
converse
with
the
people
in
the
king
s
name
he
went
to
the
throne
and
addressing
the
spirit
in
the
inner
room
informed
him
of
the
business
in
hand
then
he
smoked
one
or
two
pipes
of
tobacco
and
in
a
few
minutes
began
to
rave
which
was
a
sign
that
the
spirit
had
entered
into
him
in
this
condition
he
spoke
with
the
voice
and
made
known
the
wishes
of
the
late
king
when
he
had
done
so
the
spirit
left
him
and
returned
into
the
inner
room
and
he
himself
departed
a
mere
man
as
before
every
year
at
the
new
moon
of
september
the
king
of
sofala
in
eastern
africa
used
to
perform
obsequies
for
the
kings
his
predecessors
on
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
where
they
were
buried
in
the
course
of
the
lamentations
for
the
dead
the
soul
of
the
king
who
had
died
last
used
to
enter
into
a
man
who
imitated
the
deceased
monarch
both
in
voice
and
gesture
the
living
king
conversed
with
this
man
as
with
his
dead
father
consulting
him
in
regard
to
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
and
receiving
his
oracular
replies
these
examples
shew
that
provision
is
often
made
for
the
ghostly
succession
of
kings
and
chiefs
in
the
hausa
kingdom
of
daura
in
northern
nigeria
where
the
kings
used
regularly
to
be
put
to
death
on
the
first
symptoms
of
failing
health
the
new
king
had
to
step
over
the
corpse
of
his
predecessor
and
to
be
bathed
in
the
blood
of
a
black
ox
the
skin
of
which
then
served
as
a
shroud
for
the
body
of
the
late
king
the
ceremony
may
well
have
been
intended
to
convey
the
spirit
of
the
dead
king
to
his
successor
certainly
we
know
that
many
primitive
peoples
attribute
a
magical
virtue
to
the
act
of
stepping
over
a
person
sometimes
it
would
appear
that
the
spiritual
link
between
a
king
and
the
souls
of
his
predecessors
is
formed
by
the
possession
of
some
part
of
their
persons
in
southern
celebes
as
we
have
seen
the
regalia
often
consist
of
corporeal
portions
of
deceased
rajahs
which
are
treasured
as
sacred
relics
and
confer
the
right
to
the
throne
similarly
among
the
sakalavas
of
southern
madagascar
a
vertebra
of
the
neck
a
nail
and
a
lock
of
hair
of
a
deceased
king
are
placed
in
a
crocodile
s
tooth
and
carefully
kept
along
with
the
similar
relics
of
his
predecessors
in
a
house
set
apart
for
the
purpose
the
possession
of
these
relics
constitutes
the
right
to
the
throne
a
legitimate
heir
who
should
be
deprived
of
them
would
lose
all
his
authority
over
the
people
and
on
the
contrary
a
usurper
who
should
make
himself
master
of
the
relics
would
be
acknowledged
king
without
dispute
it
has
sometimes
happened
that
a
relation
of
the
reigning
monarch
has
stolen
the
crocodile
teeth
with
their
precious
contents
and
then
had
himself
proclaimed
king
accordingly
when
the
hovas
invaded
the
country
knowing
the
superstition
of
the
natives
they
paid
less
attention
to
the
living
king
than
to
the
relics
of
the
dead
which
they
publicly
exhibited
under
a
strong
guard
on
pretext
of
paying
them
the
honours
that
were
their
due
in
antiquity
when
a
king
of
the
panebian
libyans
died
his
people
buried
the
body
but
cut
off
the
head
and
having
covered
it
with
gold
they
dedicated
it
in
a
sanctuary
among
the
masai
of
east
africa
when
an
important
chief
has
been
dead
and
buried
for
a
year
his
eldest
son
or
other
successor
removes
the
skull
of
the
deceased
while
he
at
the
same
time
offers
a
sacrifice
and
a
libation
with
goat
s
blood
milk
and
honey
he
then
carefully
secrets
the
skull
the
possession
of
which
is
understood
to
confirm
him
in
power
and
to
impart
to
him
some
of
the
wisdom
of
his
predecessor
when
the
alake
or
king
of
abeokuta
in
west
africa
dies
the
principal
men
decapitate
his
body
and
placing
the
head
in
a
large
earthen
vessel
deliver
it
to
the
new
sovereign
it
becomes
his
fetish
and
he
is
bound
to
pay
it
honours
similarly
when
the
jaga
or
king
of
cassange
in
angola
has
departed
this
life
an
official
extracts
a
tooth
from
the
deceased
monarch
and
presents
it
to
his
successor
who
deposits
it
along
with
the
teeth
of
former
kings
in
a
box
which
is
the
sole
property
of
the
crown
and
without
which
no
jaga
can
legitimately
exercise
the
regal
power
sometimes
in
order
apparently
that
the
new
sovereign
may
inherit
more
surely
the
magical
and
other
virtues
of
the
royal
line
he
is
required
to
eat
a
piece
of
his
dead
predecessor
thus
at
abeokuta
not
only
was
the
head
of
the
late
king
presented
to
his
successor
but
the
tongue
was
cut
out
and
given
him
to
eat
hence
when
the
natives
wish
to
signify
that
the
sovereign
reigns
they
say
he
has
eaten
the
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
is
still
practised
at
ibadan
a
large
town
in
the
interior
of
lagos
west
africa
when
the
king
dies
his
head
is
cut
off
and
sent
to
his
nominal
suzerain
the
alafin
of
oyo
the
paramount
king
of
yoruba
land
but
his
heart
is
eaten
by
his
successor
this
ceremony
was
performed
a
few
years
ago
at
the
accession
of
a
new
king
of
ibadan
taking
the
whole
of
the
preceding
evidence
into
account
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
when
the
divine
king
or
priest
is
put
to
death
his
spirit
is
believed
to
pass
into
his
successor
in
point
of
fact
we
have
seen
that
among
the
shilluk
of
the
white
nile
who
regularly
kill
their
divine
kings
every
king
on
his
accession
has
to
perform
a
ceremony
which
appears
designed
to
convey
to
him
the
same
sacred
and
worshipful
spirit
which
animated
all
his
predecessors
one
after
the
other
on
the
throne
chapter
viii
the
killing
of
the
the
whitsuntide
mummers
it
remains
to
ask
what
light
the
custom
of
killing
the
divine
king
or
priest
sheds
upon
the
special
subject
of
our
enquiry
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
we
saw
reason
to
suppose
that
the
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
was
regarded
as
an
incarnation
of
a
or
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
and
that
as
such
he
would
be
endowed
in
the
belief
of
his
worshippers
with
a
magical
power
of
making
the
trees
to
bear
fruit
the
crops
to
grow
and
so
on
his
life
must
therefore
have
been
held
very
precious
by
his
worshippers
and
was
probably
hedged
in
by
a
system
of
elaborate
precautions
or
taboos
like
those
by
which
in
so
many
places
the
life
of
the
has
been
guarded
against
the
malignant
influence
of
demons
and
sorcerers
but
we
have
seen
that
the
very
value
attached
to
the
life
of
the
necessitates
his
violent
death
as
the
only
means
of
preserving
it
from
the
inevitable
decay
of
age
the
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
the
king
of
the
wood
he
too
had
to
be
killed
in
order
that
the
divine
spirit
incarnate
in
him
might
be
transferred
in
its
integrity
to
his
successor
the
rule
that
he
held
office
till
a
stronger
should
slay
him
might
be
supposed
to
secure
both
the
preservation
of
his
divine
life
in
full
vigour
and
its
transference
to
a
suitable
successor
as
soon
as
that
vigour
began
to
be
impaired
for
so
long
as
he
could
maintain
his
position
by
the
strong
hand
it
might
be
inferred
that
his
natural
force
was
not
abated
whereas
his
defeat
and
death
at
the
hands
of
another
proved
that
his
strength
was
beginning
to
fail
and
that
it
was
time
his
divine
life
should
be
lodged
in
a
less
dilapidated
tabernacle
this
explanation
of
the
rule
that
the
king
of
the
wood
had
to
be
slain
by
his
successor
at
least
renders
that
rule
perfectly
intelligible
it
is
strongly
supported
by
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
shilluk
who
put
their
divine
king
to
death
at
the
first
signs
of
failing
health
lest
his
decrepitude
should
entail
a
corresponding
failure
of
vital
energy
on
the
corn
the
cattle
and
men
moreover
it
is
countenanced
by
the
analogy
of
the
chitomé
upon
whose
life
the
existence
of
the
world
was
supposed
to
hang
and
who
was
therefore
slain
by
his
successor
as
soon
as
he
shewed
signs
of
breaking
up
again
the
terms
on
which
in
later
times
the
king
of
calicut
held
office
are
identical
with
those
attached
to
the
office
of
king
of
the
wood
except
that
whereas
the
former
might
be
assailed
by
a
candidate
at
any
time
the
king
of
calicut
might
only
be
attacked
once
every
twelve
years
but
as
the
leave
granted
to
the
king
of
calicut
to
reign
so
long
as
he
could
defend
himself
against
all
comers
was
a
mitigation
of
the
old
rule
which
set
a
fixed
term
to
his
life
so
we
may
conjecture
that
the
similar
permission
granted
to
the
king
of
the
wood
was
a
mitigation
of
an
older
custom
of
putting
him
to
death
at
the
end
of
a
definite
period
in
both
cases
the
new
rule
gave
to
the
at
least
a
chance
for
his
life
which
under
the
old
rule
was
denied
him
and
people
probably
reconciled
themselves
to
the
change
by
reflecting
that
so
long
as
the
could
maintain
himself
by
the
sword
against
all
assaults
there
was
no
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
fatal
decay
had
set
in
the
conjecture
that
the
king
of
the
wood
was
formerly
put
to
death
at
the
expiry
of
a
fixed
term
without
being
allowed
a
chance
for
his
life
will
be
confirmed
if
evidence
can
be
adduced
of
a
custom
of
periodically
killing
his
counterparts
the
human
representatives
of
the
in
northern
europe
now
in
point
of
fact
such
a
custom
has
left
unmistakable
traces
of
itself
in
the
rural
festivals
of
the
peasantry
to
take
examples
at
niederpöring
in
lower
bavaria
the
whitsuntide
representative
of
the
as
he
was
clad
from
top
to
toe
in
leaves
and
flowers
on
his
head
he
wore
a
high
pointed
cap
the
ends
of
which
rested
on
his
shoulders
only
two
holes
being
left
in
it
for
his
eyes
the
cap
was
covered
with
and
surmounted
with
a
nosegay
of
peonies
the
sleeves
of
his
coat
were
also
made
of
and
the
rest
of
his
body
was
enveloped
in
alder
and
hazel
leaves
on
each
side
of
him
marched
a
boy
holding
up
one
of
the
arms
these
two
boys
carried
drawn
swords
and
so
did
most
of
the
others
who
formed
the
procession
they
stopped
at
every
house
where
they
hoped
to
receive
a
present
and
the
people
in
hiding
soused
the
boy
with
water
all
rejoiced
when
he
was
well
drenched
finally
he
waded
into
the
brook
up
to
his
middle
whereupon
one
of
the
boys
standing
on
the
bridge
pretended
to
cut
off
his
head
at
wurmlingen
in
swabia
a
score
of
young
fellows
dress
themselves
on
in
white
shirts
and
white
trousers
with
red
scarves
round
their
waists
and
swords
hanging
from
the
scarves
they
ride
on
horseback
into
the
wood
led
by
two
trumpeters
blowing
their
trumpets
in
the
wood
they
cut
down
leafy
oak
branches
in
which
they
envelop
from
head
to
foot
him
who
was
the
last
of
their
number
to
ride
out
of
the
village
his
legs
however
are
encased
separately
so
that
he
may
be
able
to
mount
his
horse
again
further
they
give
him
a
long
artificial
neck
with
an
artificial
head
and
a
false
face
on
the
top
of
it
then
a
is
cut
generally
an
aspen
or
beech
about
ten
feet
high
and
being
decked
with
coloured
handkerchiefs
and
ribbons
it
is
entrusted
to
a
special
the
cavalcade
then
returns
with
music
and
song
to
the
village
amongst
the
personages
who
figure
in
the
procession
are
a
moorish
king
with
a
sooty
face
and
a
crown
on
his
head
a
a
corporal
and
an
executioner
they
halt
on
the
village
green
and
each
of
the
characters
makes
a
speech
in
rhyme
the
executioner
announces
that
the
man
has
been
condemned
to
death
and
cuts
off
his
false
head
then
the
riders
race
to
the
which
has
been
set
up
a
little
way
off
the
first
man
who
succeeds
in
wrenching
it
from
the
ground
as
he
gallops
past
keeps
it
with
all
its
decorations
the
ceremony
is
observed
every
second
or
third
year
in
saxony
and
thüringen
there
is
a
whitsuntide
ceremony
called
chasing
the
wild
man
out
of
the
bush
or
fetching
the
wild
man
out
of
the
a
young
fellow
is
enveloped
in
leaves
or
moss
and
called
the
wild
man
he
hides
in
the
wood
and
the
other
lads
of
the
village
go
out
to
seek
him
they
find
him
lead
him
captive
out
of
the
wood
and
fire
at
him
with
blank
muskets
he
falls
like
dead
to
the
ground
but
a
lad
dressed
as
a
doctor
bleeds
him
and
he
comes
to
life
again
at
this
they
rejoice
and
binding
him
fast
on
a
waggon
take
him
to
the
village
where
they
tell
all
the
people
how
they
have
caught
the
wild
man
at
every
house
they
receive
a
gift
in
the
erzgebirge
the
following
custom
was
annually
observed
at
shrovetide
about
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
two
men
disguised
as
wild
men
the
one
in
brushwood
and
moss
the
other
in
straw
were
led
about
the
streets
and
at
last
taken
to
the
where
they
were
chased
up
and
down
shot
and
stabbed
before
falling
they
reeled
about
with
strange
gestures
and
spirted
blood
on
the
people
from
bladders
which
they
carried
when
they
were
down
the
huntsmen
placed
them
on
boards
and
carried
them
to
the
the
miners
marching
beside
them
and
winding
blasts
on
their
mining
tools
as
if
they
had
taken
a
noble
head
of
game
a
very
similar
shrovetide
custom
is
still
observed
near
schluckenau
in
bohemia
a
man
dressed
up
as
a
wild
man
is
chased
through
several
streets
till
he
comes
to
a
narrow
lane
across
which
a
cord
is
stretched
he
stumbles
over
the
cord
and
falling
to
the
ground
is
overtaken
and
caught
by
his
pursuers
the
executioner
runs
up
and
stabs
with
his
sword
a
bladder
filled
with
blood
which
the
wild
man
wears
round
his
body
so
the
wild
man
dies
while
a
stream
of
blood
reddens
the
ground
next
day
a
made
up
to
look
like
the
wild
man
is
placed
on
a
litter
and
accompanied
by
a
great
crowd
is
taken
to
a
pool
into
which
it
is
thrown
by
the
executioner
the
ceremony
is
called
burying
the
in
semic
bohemia
the
custom
of
beheading
the
king
is
observed
on
a
troop
of
young
people
disguise
themselves
each
is
girt
with
a
girdle
of
bark
and
carries
a
wooden
sword
and
a
trumpet
of
the
king
wears
a
robe
of
adorned
with
flowers
on
his
head
is
a
crown
of
bark
decked
with
flowers
and
branches
his
feet
are
wound
about
with
ferns
a
mask
hides
his
face
and
for
a
sceptre
he
has
a
hawthorn
switch
in
his
hand
a
lad
leads
him
through
the
village
by
a
rope
fastened
to
his
foot
while
the
rest
dance
about
blow
their
trumpets
and
whistle
in
every
farmhouse
the
king
is
chased
round
the
room
and
one
of
the
troop
amid
much
noise
and
outcry
strikes
with
his
sword
a
blow
on
the
king
s
robe
of
bark
till
it
rings
again
then
a
gratuity
is
demanded
the
ceremony
of
decapitation
which
is
here
somewhat
slurred
over
is
carried
out
with
a
greater
semblance
of
reality
in
other
parts
of
bohemia
thus
in
some
villages
of
the
königgrätz
district
on
the
girls
assemble
under
one
and
the
young
men
under
another
all
dressed
in
their
best
and
tricked
out
with
ribbons
the
young
men
twine
a
garland
for
the
queen
and
the
girls
another
for
the
king
when
they
have
chosen
the
king
and
queen
they
all
go
in
procession
two
and
two
to
the
from
the
balcony
of
which
the
crier
proclaims
the
names
of
the
king
and
queen
both
are
then
invested
with
the
insignia
of
their
office
and
are
crowned
with
the
garlands
while
the
music
plays
up
then
some
one
gets
on
a
bench
and
accuses
the
king
of
various
offences
such
as
the
cattle
the
king
appeals
to
witnesses
and
a
trial
ensues
at
the
close
of
which
the
judge
who
carries
a
white
wand
as
his
badge
of
office
pronounces
a
verdict
of
guilty
or
not
if
the
verdict
is
guilty
the
judge
breaks
his
wand
the
king
kneels
on
a
white
cloth
all
heads
are
bared
and
a
soldier
sets
three
or
four
hats
one
above
the
other
on
his
majesty
s
head
the
judge
then
pronounces
the
word
guilty
thrice
in
a
loud
voice
and
orders
the
crier
to
behead
the
king
the
crier
obeys
by
striking
off
the
king
s
hats
with
his
wooden
sword
but
perhaps
for
our
purpose
the
most
instructive
of
these
mimic
executions
is
the
following
bohemian
one
which
has
been
in
part
described
already
in
some
places
of
the
pilsen
district
bohemia
on
the
king
is
dressed
in
bark
ornamented
with
flowers
and
ribbons
he
wears
a
crown
of
gilt
paper
and
rides
a
horse
which
is
also
decked
with
flowers
attended
by
a
judge
an
executioner
and
other
characters
and
followed
by
a
train
of
soldiers
all
mounted
he
rides
to
the
village
square
where
a
hut
or
arbour
of
green
boughs
has
been
erected
under
the
which
are
firs
freshly
cut
peeled
to
the
top
and
dressed
with
flowers
and
ribbons
after
the
dames
and
maidens
of
the
village
have
been
criticised
and
a
frog
beheaded
in
the
way
already
described
the
cavalcade
rides
to
a
place
previously
determined
upon
in
a
straight
broad
street
here
they
draw
up
in
two
lines
and
the
king
takes
to
flight
he
is
given
a
short
start
and
rides
off
at
full
speed
pursued
by
the
whole
troop
if
they
fail
to
catch
him
he
remains
king
for
another
year
and
his
companions
must
pay
his
score
at
the
in
the
evening
but
if
they
overtake
and
catch
him
he
is
scourged
with
hazel
rods
or
beaten
with
the
wooden
swords
and
compelled
to
dismount
then
the
executioner
asks
shall
i
behead
this
king
the
answer
is
given
behead
him
the
executioner
brandishes
his
axe
and
with
the
words
one
two
three
let
the
king
headless
be
he
strikes
off
the
king
s
crown
amid
the
loud
cries
of
the
bystanders
the
king
sinks
to
the
ground
then
he
is
laid
on
a
bier
and
carried
to
the
nearest
farmhouse
in
most
of
the
personages
who
are
thus
slain
in
mimicry
it
is
impossible
not
to
recognise
representatives
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
as
he
is
supposed
to
manifest
himself
in
spring
the
bark
leaves
and
flowers
in
which
the
actors
are
dressed
and
the
season
of
the
year
at
which
they
appear
shew
that
they
belong
to
the
same
class
as
the
grass
king
king
of
the
may
and
other
representatives
of
the
vernal
spirit
of
vegetation
which
we
examined
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
as
if
to
remove
any
possible
doubt
on
this
head
we
find
that
in
two
cases
these
slain
men
are
brought
into
direct
connexion
with
which
are
the
impersonal
as
the
may
king
grass
king
and
so
forth
are
the
personal
representatives
of
the
the
drenching
of
the
with
water
and
his
wading
up
to
the
middle
into
the
brook
are
therefore
no
doubt
like
those
which
have
been
already
described
but
if
these
personages
represent
as
they
certainly
do
the
spirit
of
vegetation
in
spring
the
question
arises
why
kill
them
what
is
the
object
of
slaying
the
spirit
of
vegetation
at
any
time
and
above
all
in
spring
when
his
services
are
most
wanted
the
only
probable
answer
to
this
question
seems
to
be
given
in
the
explanation
already
proposed
of
the
custom
of
killing
the
divine
king
or
priest
the
divine
life
incarnate
in
a
material
and
mortal
body
is
liable
to
be
tainted
and
corrupted
by
the
weakness
of
the
frail
medium
in
which
it
is
for
a
time
enshrined
and
if
it
is
to
be
saved
from
the
increasing
enfeeblement
which
it
must
necessarily
share
with
its
human
incarnation
as
he
advances
in
years
it
must
be
detached
from
him
before
or
at
least
as
soon
as
he
exhibits
signs
of
decay
in
order
to
be
transferred
to
a
vigorous
successor
this
is
done
by
killing
the
old
representative
of
the
god
and
conveying
the
divine
spirit
from
him
to
a
new
incarnation
the
killing
of
the
god
that
is
of
his
human
incarnation
is
therefore
merely
a
necessary
step
to
his
revival
or
resurrection
in
a
better
form
far
from
being
an
extinction
of
the
divine
spirit
it
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
purer
and
stronger
manifestation
of
it
if
this
explanation
holds
good
of
the
custom
of
killing
divine
kings
and
priests
in
general
it
is
still
more
obviously
applicable
to
the
custom
of
annually
killing
the
representative
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
in
spring
for
the
decay
of
plant
life
in
winter
is
readily
interpreted
by
primitive
man
as
an
enfeeblement
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
the
spirit
has
he
thinks
grown
old
and
weak
and
must
therefore
be
renovated
by
being
slain
and
brought
to
life
in
a
younger
and
fresher
form
thus
the
killing
of
the
representative
of
the
in
spring
is
regarded
as
a
means
to
promote
and
quicken
the
growth
of
vegetation
for
the
killing
of
the
is
associated
always
we
must
suppose
implicitly
and
sometimes
explicitly
also
with
a
revival
or
resurrection
of
him
in
a
more
youthful
and
vigorous
form
so
in
the
saxon
and
thüringen
custom
after
the
wild
man
has
been
shot
he
is
brought
to
life
again
by
a
doctor
and
in
the
wurmlingen
ceremony
there
figures
a
who
probably
once
played
a
similar
part
certainly
in
another
spring
ceremony
which
will
be
described
presently
pretends
to
restore
a
dead
man
to
life
but
of
this
revival
or
resurrection
of
the
god
we
shall
have
more
to
say
anon
the
points
of
similarity
between
these
north
european
personages
and
the
subject
of
our
king
of
the
wood
or
priest
of
sufficiently
striking
in
these
northern
maskers
we
see
kings
whose
dress
of
bark
and
leaves
along
with
the
hut
of
green
boughs
and
the
under
which
they
hold
their
court
proclaim
them
unmistakably
as
like
their
italian
counterpart
kings
of
the
wood
like
him
they
die
a
violent
death
but
like
him
they
may
escape
from
it
for
a
time
by
their
bodily
strength
and
agility
for
in
several
of
these
northern
customs
the
flight
and
pursuit
of
the
king
is
a
prominent
part
of
the
ceremony
and
in
one
case
at
least
if
the
king
can
outrun
his
pursuers
he
retains
his
life
and
his
office
for
another
year
in
this
last
case
the
king
in
fact
holds
office
on
condition
of
running
for
his
life
once
a
year
just
as
the
king
of
calicut
in
later
times
held
office
on
condition
of
defending
his
life
against
all
comers
once
every
twelve
years
and
just
as
the
priest
of
nemi
held
office
on
condition
of
defending
himself
against
any
assault
at
any
time
in
every
one
of
these
instances
the
life
of
the
is
prolonged
on
condition
of
his
shewing
in
a
severe
physical
contest
of
fight
or
flight
that
his
bodily
strength
is
not
decayed
and
that
therefore
the
violent
death
which
sooner
or
later
is
inevitable
may
for
the
present
be
postponed
with
regard
to
flight
it
is
noticeable
that
flight
figured
conspicuously
both
in
the
legend
and
in
the
practice
of
the
king
of
the
wood
he
had
to
be
a
runaway
slave
in
memory
of
the
flight
of
orestes
the
traditional
founder
of
the
worship
hence
the
kings
of
the
wood
are
described
by
an
ancient
writer
as
both
strong
of
hand
and
fleet
of
perhaps
if
we
knew
the
ritual
of
the
arician
grove
fully
we
might
find
that
the
king
was
allowed
a
chance
for
his
life
by
flight
like
his
bohemian
brother
i
have
already
conjectured
that
the
annual
flight
of
the
priestly
king
at
rome
was
at
first
a
flight
of
the
same
kind
in
other
words
that
he
was
originally
one
of
those
divine
kings
who
are
either
put
to
death
after
a
fixed
period
or
allowed
to
prove
by
the
strong
hand
or
the
fleet
foot
that
their
divinity
is
vigorous
and
unimpaired
one
more
point
of
resemblance
may
be
noted
between
the
italian
king
of
the
wood
and
his
northern
counterparts
in
saxony
and
thüringen
the
representative
of
the
after
being
killed
is
brought
to
life
again
by
a
doctor
this
is
exactly
what
legend
affirmed
to
have
happened
to
the
first
king
of
the
wood
at
nemi
hippolytus
or
virbius
who
after
he
had
been
killed
by
his
horses
was
restored
to
life
by
the
physician
aesculapius
such
a
legend
tallies
well
with
the
theory
that
the
slaying
of
the
king
of
the
wood
was
only
a
step
to
his
revival
or
resurrection
in
his
successor
mock
human
sacrifices
in
the
preceding
discussion
it
has
been
assumed
that
the
mock
killing
of
the
wild
man
and
of
the
king
in
north
european
is
a
modern
substitute
for
an
ancient
custom
of
killing
them
in
earnest
those
who
best
know
the
tenacity
of
life
possessed
by
and
its
tendency
with
the
growth
of
civilisation
to
dwindle
from
solemn
ritual
into
mere
pageant
and
pastime
will
be
least
likely
to
question
the
truth
of
this
assumption
that
human
sacrifices
were
commonly
offered
by
the
ancestors
of
the
civilised
races
of
north
europe
celts
teutons
and
slavs
is
certain
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
the
modern
peasant
should
do
in
mimicry
what
his
forefathers
did
in
reality
we
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
in
other
parts
of
the
world
mock
human
sacrifices
have
been
substituted
for
real
ones
thus
in
minahassa
a
district
of
celebes
human
victims
used
to
be
regularly
sacrificed
at
certain
festivals
but
through
dutch
influence
the
custom
was
abolished
and
a
sham
sacrifice
substituted
for
it
the
victim
was
seated
in
a
chair
and
all
the
usual
preparations
were
made
for
sacrificing
him
but
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
chief
priest
had
heaved
up
his
flashing
swords
for
he
wielded
two
of
them
to
deal
the
fatal
stroke
his
assistants
sprang
forward
their
hands
wrapt
in
cloths
to
grasp
and
arrest
the
descending
blades
the
precaution
was
necessary
for
the
priest
was
wound
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
excitement
that
if
left
alone
he
might
have
consummated
the
sacrifice
afterwards
an
effigy
made
out
of
the
stem
of
a
was
substituted
for
the
human
victim
and
the
blood
which
might
not
be
wanting
was
supplied
by
fowls
near
the
native
town
of
luba
in
western
busoga
a
district
of
central
africa
there
is
a
sacred
tree
of
the
species
known
as
its
glossy
white
trunk
shoots
up
to
a
height
of
a
hundred
feet
before
it
sends
out
branches
the
tree
is
surrounded
by
small
fetish
huts
and
curious
arcades
once
when
the
dry
season
was
drawing
to
an
end
and
the
new
crops
were
not
yet
ripe
the
basoga
suffered
from
hunger
so
they
came
to
the
sacred
tree
in
canoes
of
which
the
prows
were
decked
with
wreaths
of
yellow
acacia
blossom
and
other
flowers
landing
on
the
shore
they
stripped
themselves
of
their
clothing
and
wrapped
ropes
made
of
green
creepers
and
leaves
round
their
arms
and
necks
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
they
danced
to
an
accompaniment
of
song
then
a
little
girl
about
ten
years
old
was
brought
and
laid
at
the
base
of
the
tree
as
if
she
were
to
be
sacrificed
every
detail
of
the
sacrifice
was
gone
through
in
mimicry
a
slight
cut
was
made
in
the
child
s
neck
and
she
was
then
caught
up
and
thrown
into
the
lake
where
a
man
stood
ready
to
save
her
from
drowning
by
native
custom
the
girl
on
whom
this
ceremony
had
been
performed
was
dedicated
to
a
life
of
perpetual
virginity
captain
bourke
was
informed
by
an
old
chief
that
the
indians
of
arizona
used
to
offer
human
sacrifices
at
the
feast
of
fire
when
the
days
are
shortest
the
victim
had
his
throat
cut
his
breast
opened
and
his
heart
taken
out
by
one
of
the
priests
this
custom
was
abolished
by
the
mexicans
but
for
a
long
time
afterwards
a
modified
form
of
it
was
secretly
observed
as
follows
the
victim
generally
a
young
man
had
his
throat
cut
and
blood
was
allowed
to
flow
freely
but
the
sprinkled
medicine
on
the
gash
which
soon
healed
up
and
the
man
recovered
so
in
the
ritual
of
artemis
at
halae
in
attica
a
man
s
throat
was
cut
and
the
blood
allowed
to
gush
out
but
he
was
not
killed
at
the
funeral
of
a
chief
in
nias
slaves
are
sacrificed
a
little
of
their
hair
is
cut
off
and
then
they
are
beheaded
the
victims
are
generally
purchased
for
the
purpose
and
their
number
is
proportioned
to
the
wealth
and
power
of
the
deceased
but
if
the
number
required
is
excessively
great
or
can
not
be
procured
some
of
the
chiefs
own
slaves
undergo
a
sham
sacrifice
they
are
told
and
believe
that
they
are
about
to
be
decapitated
their
heads
are
placed
on
a
log
and
their
necks
struck
with
the

fright

some
of
them

kind

afterwards
he
is
brought
to
life
by
being
sprinkled
with
blood
drawn
from
the
thigh
of
a
worshipper
of
vishnu
the
crowd
of
spectators
is
fully
convinced
of
the
reality
of
this
simulated
death
and
resurrection
the
malayans
a
caste
of
southern
india
act
as
devil
dancers
for
the
purpose
of
exorcising
demons
who
have
taken
possession
of
people
one
of
their
ceremonies
known
as
has
several
forms
all
of
which
seem
to
be
either
survivals
or
at
least
imitations
of
human
sacrifice
one
of
these
consists
of
a
mock
living
burial
of
the
principal
performer
who
is
placed
in
a
pit
which
is
covered
with
planks
on
the
top
of
which
a
sacrifice
is
performed
with
a
fire
kindled
with
jack
wood
and
a
plant
called
erinna
in
another
variety
the
malayan
cuts
his
left
forearm
and
smears
his
face
with
the
blood
thus
in
samoa
where
every
family
had
its
god
incarnate
in
one
or
more
species
of
animals
any
disrespect
shewn
to
the
worshipful
animal
either
by
members
of
the
kin
or
by
a
stranger
in
their
presence
had
to
be
atoned
for
by
pretending
to
bake
one
of
the
family
in
a
cold
oven
as
a
burnt
sacrifice
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
offended
god
for
example
if
a
stranger
staying
in
a
household
whose
god
was
incarnate
in
were
to
catch
and
cook
one
of
these
creatures
or
if
a
member
of
the
family
had
been
present
where
a
was
eaten
the
family
would
meet
in
solemn
conclave
and
choose
a
man
or
woman
to
go
and
lie
down
in
a
cold
oven
where
he
would
be
covered
over
with
leaves
just
as
if
he
were
really
being
baked
while
this
mock
sacrifice
was
being
carried
out
the
family
prayed
o
forgive
what
has
been
done
it
was
all
the
work
of
a
if
they
had
not
thus
abased
themselves
before
the
divine
he
would
undoubtedly
have
come
and
been
the
death
of
somebody
by
making
a
to
grow
in
his
inside
sometimes
as
in
minahassa
the
pretended
sacrifice
is
carried
out
not
on
a
living
person
but
on
an
effigy
at
the
city
of
the
sun
in
ancient
egypt
three
men
used
to
be
sacrificed
every
day
after
the
priests
had
stripped
and
examined
them
like
calves
to
see
whether
they
were
without
blemish
and
fit
for
the
altar
but
king
amasis
ordered
waxen
images
to
be
substituted
for
the
human
victims
an
indian
the
prescribes
that
when
the
sacrifice
of
lions
tigers
or
human
beings
is
required
an
image
of
a
lion
tiger
or
man
shall
be
made
with
butter
paste
or
barley
meal
and
sacrificed
instead
some
of
the
gonds
of
india
formerly
offered
human
sacrifices
they
now
sacrifice
which
are
found
to
answer
the
purpose
just
as
well
colonel
dalton
was
told
that
in
some
of
their
villages
the
bhagats
annually
make
an
image
of
a
man
in
wood
put
clothes
and
ornaments
on
it
and
present
it
before
the
altar
of
a
mahádeo
the
person
who
officiates
as
priest
on
the
occasion
says
o
mahádeo
we
sacrifice
this
man
to
you
according
to
ancient
customs
give
us
rain
in
due
season
and
a
plentiful
then
with
one
stroke
of
the
axe
the
head
of
the
image
is
struck
off
and
the
body
is
removed
and
formerly
when
a
siamese
army
was
about
to
take
the
field
a
condemned
criminal
representing
the
enemy
was
put
to
death
but
a
humane
king
caused
a
puppet
to
be
substituted
for
the
man
the
effigy
is
felled
by
the
blow
of
an
axe
and
if
it
drops
at
the
first
stroke
the
omen
is
favourable
in
the
east
indian
island
of
siaoo
or
siauw
one
of
the
sangi
group
a
child
stolen
from
a
neighbouring
island
used
to
be
sacrificed
every
year
to
the
spirit
of
a
volcano
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
eruption
the
victim
was
slowly
tortured
to
death
in
the
temple
by
a
priestess
who
cut
off
the
child
s
ears
nose
fingers
and
so
on
then
consummated
the
sacrifice
by
splitting
open
the
breast
the
spectacle
was
witnessed
by
hundreds
of
people
and
feasting
and
went
on
for
nine
days
afterwards
in
course
of
time
the
annual
human
victim
was
replaced
by
a
wooden
puppet
which
was
cut
to
pieces
in
the
same
manner
the
kayans
of
borneo
used
to
kill
slaves
at
the
death
of
a
chief
and
nail
them
to
the
tomb
in
order
that
they
might
accompany
the
chief
on
his
long
journey
to
the
other
world
and
paddle
the
canoe
in
which
he
must
travel
this
is
no
longer
done
but
instead
they
put
up
a
wooden
figure
of
a
man
at
the
head
and
another
of
a
woman
at
the
foot
of
the
chief
s
coffin
as
it
lies
in
state
before
the
funeral
and
a
small
wooden
image
of
a
man
is
usually
fixed
on
the
top
of
the
tomb
to
row
the
canoe
for
the
dead
chief
in
ancient
times
human
sacrifices
used
to
be
offered
at
the
graves
of
mikados
and
princes
of
japan
the
personal
attendants
of
the
deceased
being
buried
alive
within
the
precincts
of
the
tomb
but
a
humane
emperor
ordered
that
clay
images
should
thenceforth
be
substituted
for
live
men
and
women
one
of
these
images
is
now
in
the
british
museum
the
toboongkoos
of
central
celebes
who
are
reported
still
to
carry
home
as
trophies
the
heads
of
their
slain
enemies
resort
to
the
following
cure
for
certain
kinds
of
sickness
the
heathen
priestess
cuts
the
likeness
of
a
human
head
out
of
the
sheath
of
a
and
sets
it
up
on
three
sticks
in
the
courtyard
of
the
house
the
patient
arrayed
in
his
or
her
best
clothes
is
then
brought
down
into
the
court
and
remains
there
while
women
dance
and
sing
round
the
artificial
head
and
men
perform
sham
fights
with
shield
spear
and
bow
just
as
they
did
or
perhaps
still
do
when
they
have
brought
back
a
human
head
from
a
raid
after
that
the
sick
man
is
taken
back
to
the
house
and
an
improvement
in
his
health
is
confidently
expected
in
this
ceremony
the
sham
head
is
doubtless
a
substitute
for
a
real
one
with
these
mock
sacrifices
of
human
lives
we
may
compare
mimic
sacrifices
of
other
kinds
in
southern
india
as
in
many
parts
of
the
world
it
used
to
be
customary
to
sacrifice
joints
of
the
fingers
on
certain
occasions
thus
among
the
morasas
when
a
grandchild
was
born
in
the
family
the
wife
of
the
eldest
son
of
the
grandfather
must
have
the
last
two
joints
of
the
third
and
fourth
fingers
of
her
right
hand
amputated
at
a
temple
of
bhairava
the
amputation
was
performed
by
the
village
carpenter
with
a
chisel
nowadays
the
custom
having
been
forbidden
by
the
english
government
the
sacrifice
is
performed
in
mimicry
some
people
stick
gold
or
silver
pieces
with
flour
paste
to
the
ends
of
their
fingers
and
then
cut
or
pull
them
off
others
tie
flowers
round
the
fingers
that
used
to
be
amputated
and
go
through
a
pantomime
of
cutting
the
fingers
by
putting
a
chisel
on
the
joint
and
then
taking
it
away
others
again
twist
gold
wires
in
the
shape
of
rings
round
their
fingers
these
the
carpenter
removes
and
appropriates
in
niué
or
savage
island
in
the
south
pacific
the
following
custom
continued
till
lately
to
be
observed
when
a
boy
was
a
few
weeks
old
the
men
assembled
and
a
feast
was
made
on
the
village
square
an
awning
was
rigged
up
and
the
child
was
laid
on
the
ground
under
it
an
old
man
then
approached
it
and
performed
the
operation
of
circumcision
on
the
infant
in
dumb
show
with
his
forefinger
no
child
was
regarded
as
a
member
of
the
tribe
till
he
had
been
subjected
to
this
rite
the
natives
say
that
real
circumcision
was
never
performed
in
their
island
but
as
it
was
commonly
practised
in
fiji
tonga
and
samoa
we
may
assume
that
its
imitation
in
niué
was
a
substitute
introduced
at
some
time
or
other
for
the
actual
operation
similarly
when
an
adult
hindoo
joins
the
sect
of
the
daira
or
mahadev
mohammedans
in
mysore
a
mock
rite
of
circumcision
is
performed
on
him
instead
of
the
real
operation
a
betel
leaf
is
wrapped
round
the
male
member
of
the
neophyte
and
the
loose
end
of
the
leaf
is
snipped
off
instead
of
the
prepuce
burying
the
carnival
thus
far
i
have
offered
an
explanation
of
the
rule
which
required
that
the
priest
of
nemi
should
be
slain
by
his
successor
the
explanation
claims
to
be
no
more
than
probable
our
scanty
knowledge
of
the
custom
and
of
its
history
forbids
it
to
be
more
but
its
probability
will
be
augmented
in
proportion
to
the
extent
to
which
the
motives
and
modes
of
thought
which
it
assumes
can
be
proved
to
have
operated
in
primitive
society
hitherto
the
god
with
whose
death
and
resurrection
we
have
been
chiefly
concerned
has
been
the
but
if
i
can
shew
that
the
custom
of
killing
the
god
and
the
belief
in
his
resurrection
originated
or
at
least
existed
in
the
hunting
and
pastoral
stage
of
society
when
the
slain
god
was
an
animal
and
that
it
survived
into
the
agricultural
stage
when
the
slain
god
was
the
corn
or
a
human
being
representing
the
corn
the
probability
of
my
explanation
will
have
been
considerably
increased
this
i
shall
attempt
to
do
in
the
sequel
and
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
i
hope
to
clear
up
some
obscurities
which
still
remain
and
to
answer
some
objections
which
may
have
suggested
themselves
to
the
reader
we
start
from
the
point
at
which
we
left
spring
customs
of
european
peasantry
besides
the
ceremonies
already
described
there
are
two
kindred
sets
of
observances
in
which
the
simulated
death
of
a
divine
or
supernatural
being
is
a
conspicuous
feature
in
one
of
them
the
being
whose
death
is
dramatically
represented
is
a
personification
of
the
carnival
in
the
other
it
is
death
himself
the
former
ceremony
falls
naturally
at
the
end
of
the
carnival
either
on
the
last
day
of
that
merry
season
namely
shrove
tuesday
or
on
the
first
day
of
lent
namely
ash
wednesday
the
date
of
the
other
carrying
or
driving
out
of
death
as
it
is
commonly
not
so
uniformly
fixed
generally
it
is
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
which
hence
goes
by
the
name
of
dead
sunday
but
in
some
places
the
celebration
falls
a
week
earlier
in
others
as
among
the
czechs
of
bohemia
a
week
later
while
in
certain
german
villages
of
moravia
it
is
held
on
the
first
sunday
after
easter
perhaps
as
has
been
suggested
the
date
may
originally
have
been
variable
depending
on
the
appearance
of
the
first
swallow
or
some
other
herald
of
the
spring
some
writers
regard
the
ceremony
as
slavonic
in
its
origin
grimm
thought
it
was
a
festival
of
the
new
year
with
the
old
slavs
who
began
their
year
in
march
we
shall
first
take
examples
of
the
mimic
death
of
the
carnival
which
always
falls
before
the
other
in
the
calendar
at
frosinone
in
latium
about
between
rome
and
naples
the
dull
monotony
of
life
in
a
provincial
italian
town
is
agreeably
broken
on
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
by
the
ancient
festival
known
as
the
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
town
band
playing
lively
tunes
and
followed
by
a
great
crowd
proceeds
to
the
piazza
del
plebiscito
where
is
the
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
government
buildings
here
in
the
middle
of
the
square
the
eyes
of
the
expectant
multitude
are
greeted
by
the
sight
of
an
immense
car
decked
with
festoons
and
drawn
by
four
horses
mounted
on
the
car
is
a
huge
chair
on
which
sits
enthroned
the
majestic
figure
of
the
carnival
a
man
of
stucco
about
nine
feet
high
with
a
rubicund
and
smiling
countenance
enormous
boots
a
tin
helmet
like
those
which
grace
the
heads
of
officers
of
the
italian
marine
and
a
coat
of
many
colours
embellished
with
strange
devices
adorn
the
outward
man
of
this
stately
personage
his
left
hand
rests
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
while
with
his
right
he
gracefully
salutes
the
crowd
being
moved
to
this
act
of
civility
by
a
string
which
is
pulled
by
a
man
who
modestly
shrinks
from
publicity
under
the
and
now
the
crowd
surging
excitedly
round
the
car
gives
vent
to
its
feelings
in
wild
cries
of
joy
gentle
and
simple
being
mixed
up
together
and
all
dancing
furiously
the
a
special
feature
of
the
festival
is
that
every
one
must
carry
in
his
hand
what
is
called
a
root
by
which
is
meant
a
huge
leaf
of
the
aloe
or
rather
the
agave
any
one
who
ventured
into
the
crowd
without
such
a
leaf
would
be
unceremoniously
hustled
out
of
it
unless
indeed
he
bore
as
a
substitute
a
large
cabbage
at
the
end
of
a
long
stick
or
a
bunch
of
grass
curiously
plaited
when
the
multitude
after
a
short
turn
has
escorted
the
car
to
the
gate
of
the
they
halt
and
the
car
jolting
over
the
uneven
ground
rumbles
into
the
courtyard
a
hush
now
falls
on
the
crowd
their
subdued
voices
sounding
according
to
the
description
of
one
who
has
heard
them
like
the
murmur
of
a
troubled
sea
all
eyes
are
turned
anxiously
to
the
door
from
which
the
himself
and
the
other
representatives
of
the
majesty
of
the
law
are
expected
to
issue
and
pay
their
homage
to
the
hero
of
the
hour
a
few
moments
of
suspense
and
then
a
storm
of
cheers
and
salutes
the
appearance
of
the
dignitaries
as
they
file
out
and
descending
the
staircase
take
their
place
in
the
procession
the
hymn
of
the
carnival
is
now
thundered
out
after
which
amid
a
deafening
roar
aloe
leaves
and
cabbages
are
whirled
aloft
and
descend
impartially
on
the
heads
of
the
just
and
the
unjust
who
lend
fresh
zest
to
the
proceedings
by
engaging
in
a
free
fight
when
these
preliminaries
have
been
concluded
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
the
procession
gets
under
weigh
the
rear
is
brought
up
by
a
cart
laden
with
barrels
of
wine
and
policemen
the
latter
engaged
in
the
congenial
task
of
serving
out
wine
to
all
who
ask
for
it
while
a
most
internecine
struggle
accompanied
by
a
copious
discharge
of
yells
blows
and
blasphemy
goes
on
among
the
surging
crowd
at
the
cart
s
tail
in
their
anxiety
not
to
miss
the
glorious
opportunity
of
intoxicating
themselves
at
the
public
expense
finally
after
the
procession
has
paraded
the
principal
streets
in
this
majestic
manner
the
effigy
of
carnival
is
taken
to
the
middle
of
a
public
square
stripped
of
his
finery
laid
on
a
pile
of
wood
and
burnt
amid
the
cries
of
the
multitude
who
thundering
out
once
more
the
song
of
the
carnival
fling
their
roots
on
the
pyre
and
give
themselves
up
without
restraint
to
the
pleasures
of
the
dance
in
the
abruzzi
a
pasteboard
figure
of
the
carnival
is
carried
by
four
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
and
bottles
of
wine
slung
at
their
in
front
walks
the
wife
of
the
carnival
dressed
in
mourning
and
dissolved
in
tears
from
time
to
time
the
company
halts
and
while
the
wife
addresses
the
sympathising
public
the
refresh
the
inner
man
with
a
pull
at
the
bottle
in
the
open
square
the
mimic
corpse
is
laid
on
a
pyre
and
to
the
roll
of
drums
the
shrill
screams
of
the
women
and
the
gruffer
cries
of
the
men
a
light
is
set
to
it
while
the
figure
burns
chestnuts
are
thrown
about
among
the
crowd
sometimes
the
carnival
is
represented
by
a
at
the
top
of
a
pole
which
is
borne
through
the
town
by
a
troop
of
mummers
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
when
evening
comes
on
four
of
the
mummers
hold
out
a
quilt
or
sheet
by
the
corners
and
the
figure
of
the
carnival
is
made
to
tumble
into
it
the
procession
is
then
resumed
the
performers
weeping
crocodile
tears
and
emphasising
the
poignancy
of
their
grief
by
the
help
of
saucepans
and
dinner
bells
sometimes
again
in
the
abruzzi
the
dead
carnival
is
personified
by
a
living
man
who
lies
in
a
coffin
attended
by
another
who
acts
the
priest
and
dispenses
holy
water
in
great
profusion
from
a
bathing
tub
in
malta
the
death
of
the
carnival
used
to
be
mourned
by
women
on
the
last
day
of
the
merry
festival
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
black
mantles
they
carried
through
the
streets
of
the
city
the
linen
effigy
of
a
corpse
stuffed
with
straw
or
hay
and
decked
with
leaves
and
oranges
as
they
carried
it
they
chanted
dirges
stopping
after
every
verse
to
howl
like
professional
mourners
the
custom
came
to
an
end
about
the
year
at
lerida
in
catalonia
the
funeral
of
the
carnival
was
witnessed
by
an
english
traveller
in
on
the
last
sunday
of
the
carnival
a
grand
procession
of
infantry
cavalry
and
maskers
of
many
sorts
some
on
horseback
and
some
in
carriages
escorted
the
grand
car
of
his
grace
pau
pi
as
the
effigy
was
called
in
triumph
through
the
principal
streets
for
three
days
the
revelry
ran
high
and
then
at
midnight
on
the
last
day
of
the
carnival
the
same
procession
again
wound
through
the
streets
but
under
a
different
aspect
and
for
a
different
end
the
triumphal
car
was
exchanged
for
a
hearse
in
which
reposed
the
effigy
of
his
dead
grace
a
troop
of
maskers
who
in
the
first
procession
had
played
the
part
of
students
of
folly
with
many
a
merry
quip
and
jest
now
robed
as
priests
and
bishops
paced
slowly
along
holding
aloft
huge
lighted
tapers
and
singing
a
dirge
all
the
mummers
wore
crape
and
all
the
horsemen
carried
blazing
flambeaux
down
the
high
street
between
the
lofty
and
balconied
houses
where
every
window
every
balcony
every
housetop
was
crammed
with
a
dense
mass
of
spectators
all
dressed
and
masked
in
fantastic
gorgeousness
the
procession
took
its
melancholy
way
over
the
scene
flashed
and
played
the
shifting
and
shadows
from
the
moving
torches
red
and
blue
bengal
lights
flared
up
and
died
out
again
and
above
the
trampling
of
the
horses
and
the
measured
tread
of
the
marching
multitude
rose
the
voices
of
the
priests
chanting
the
requiem
while
the
military
bands
struck
in
with
the
solemn
roll
of
the
muffled
drums
on
reaching
the
principal
square
the
procession
halted
a
burlesque
funeral
oration
was
pronounced
over
the
defunct
pau
pi
and
the
lights
were
extinguished
immediately
the
devil
and
his
angels
darted
from
the
crowd
seized
the
body
and
fled
away
with
it
hotly
pursued
by
the
whole
multitude
yelling
screaming
and
cheering
naturally
the
fiends
were
overtaken
and
dispersed
and
the
sham
corpse
rescued
from
their
clutches
was
laid
in
a
grave
that
had
been
made
ready
for
its
reception
thus
the
carnival
of
at
lerida
died
and
was
buried
a
ceremony
of
the
same
sort
is
observed
in
provence
on
ash
wednesday
an
effigy
called
caramantran
whimsically
attired
is
drawn
in
a
chariot
or
borne
on
a
litter
accompanied
by
the
populace
in
grotesque
costumes
who
carry
gourds
full
of
wine
and
drain
them
with
all
the
marks
real
or
affected
of
intoxication
at
the
head
of
the
procession
are
some
men
disguised
as
judges
and
barristers
and
a
tall
gaunt
personage
who
masquerades
as
lent
behind
them
follow
young
people
mounted
on
miserable
hacks
and
attired
as
mourners
who
pretend
to
bewail
the
fate
that
is
in
store
for
caramantran
in
the
principal
square
the
procession
halts
the
tribunal
is
constituted
and
caramantran
placed
at
the
bar
after
a
formal
trial
he
is
sentenced
to
death
amid
the
groans
of
the
mob
the
barrister
who
defended
him
embraces
his
client
for
the
last
time
the
officers
of
justice
do
their
duty
the
condemned
is
set
with
his
back
to
a
wall
and
hurried
into
eternity
under
a
shower
of
stones
the
sea
or
a
river
receives
his
mangled
remains
at
lussac
in
the
department
of
vienne
young
people
attired
in
long
mourning
robes
and
with
woebegone
countenances
carry
an
effigy
down
to
the
river
on
ash
wednesday
and
throw
it
into
the
river
crying
carnival
is
dead
carnival
is
dead
throughout
nearly
the
whole
of
the
ardennes
it
was
and
still
is
customary
on
ash
wednesday
to
burn
an
effigy
which
is
supposed
to
represent
the
carnival
while
appropriate
verses
are
sung
round
about
the
blazing
figure
very
often
an
attempt
is
made
to
fashion
the
effigy
in
the
likeness
of
the
husband
who
is
reputed
to
be
least
faithful
to
his
wife
of
any
in
the
village
as
might
perhaps
have
been
anticipated
the
distinction
of
being
selected
for
portraiture
under
these
painful
circumstances
has
a
slight
tendency
to
breed
domestic
jars
especially
when
the
portrait
is
burnt
in
front
of
the
house
of
the
gay
deceiver
whom
it
represents
while
a
powerful
chorus
of
caterwauls
groans
and
other
melodious
sounds
bears
public
testimony
to
the
opinion
which
his
friends
and
neighbours
entertain
of
his
private
virtues
in
some
villages
of
the
ardennes
a
young
man
of
flesh
and
blood
dressed
up
in
hay
and
straw
used
to
act
the
part
of
shrove
tuesday
as
the
personification
of
the
carnival
is
often
called
in
france
after
the
last
day
of
the
period
which
he
personates
he
was
brought
before
a
mock
tribunal
and
being
condemned
to
death
was
placed
with
his
back
to
a
wall
like
a
soldier
at
a
military
execution
and
fired
at
with
blank
cartridges
at
one
of
these
harmless
buffoons
named
thierry
was
accidentally
killed
by
a
wad
that
had
been
left
in
a
musket
of
the
when
poor
shrove
tuesday
dropped
under
the
fire
the
applause
was
loud
and
long
he
did
it
so
naturally
but
when
he
did
not
get
up
again
they
ran
to
him
and
found
him
a
corpse
since
then
there
have
been
no
more
of
these
mock
executions
in
the
ardennes
in
people
used
to
make
an
effigy
of
shrove
tuesday
on
ash
wednesday
and
carry
it
about
the
streets
to
the
accompaniment
of
songs
then
they
brought
it
to
the
public
square
where
the
offender
was
tried
in
front
of
the
judges
muffled
in
old
red
curtains
and
holding
big
books
in
their
hands
pronounced
sentence
of
death
the
mode
of
execution
varied
with
the
place
sometimes
it
was
burning
sometimes
drowning
sometimes
decapitation
in
the
last
case
the
effigy
was
provided
with
tubes
of
blood
which
spouted
gore
at
the
critical
moment
making
a
profound
impression
on
the
minds
of
children
some
of
whom
wept
bitterly
at
the
sight
meantime
the
onlookers
uttered
piercing
cries
and
appeared
to
be
plunged
in
the
deepest
grief
the
proceedings
generally
wound
up
in
the
evening
with
a
ball
which
the
young
married
people
were
obliged
to
provide
for
the
public
entertainment
otherwise
their
slumbers
were
apt
to
be
disturbed
by
the
discordant
notes
of
a
cat
s
concert
chanted
under
their
windows
in
normandy
on
the
evening
of
ash
wednesday
it
used
to
be
the
custom
to
hold
a
celebration
called
the
burial
of
shrove
tuesday
a
squalid
effigy
scantily
clothed
in
rags
a
battered
old
hat
crushed
down
on
his
dirty
face
his
great
round
paunch
stuffed
with
straw
represented
the
disreputable
old
rake
who
after
a
long
course
of
dissipation
was
now
about
to
suffer
for
his
sins
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
a
sturdy
fellow
who
pretended
to
stagger
under
the
burden
this
popular
personification
of
the
carnival
promenaded
the
streets
for
the
last
time
in
a
manner
the
reverse
of
triumphal
preceded
by
a
drummer
and
accompanied
by
a
jeering
rabble
among
whom
the
urchins
and
all
the
and
bobtail
of
the
town
mustered
in
great
force
the
figure
was
carried
about
by
the
flickering
light
of
torches
to
the
discordant
din
of
shovels
and
tongs
pots
and
pans
horns
and
kettles
mingled
with
hootings
groans
and
hisses
from
time
to
time
the
procession
halted
and
a
champion
of
morality
accused
the
old
sinner
of
all
the
excesses
he
had
committed
and
for
which
he
was
now
about
to
be
burned
alive
the
culprit
having
nothing
to
urge
in
his
own
defence
was
thrown
on
a
heap
of
straw
a
torch
was
put
to
it
and
a
great
blaze
shot
up
to
the
delight
of
the
children
who
frisked
round
it
screaming
out
some
old
popular
verses
about
the
death
of
the
carnival
sometimes
the
effigy
was
rolled
down
the
slope
of
a
hill
before
being
burnt
at
the
ragged
effigy
of
shrove
tuesday
was
followed
by
his
widow
a
big
burly
lout
dressed
as
a
woman
with
a
crape
veil
who
emitted
sounds
of
lamentation
and
woe
in
a
stentorian
voice
after
being
carried
about
the
streets
on
a
litter
attended
by
a
crowd
of
maskers
the
figure
was
thrown
into
the
river
vire
the
final
scene
has
been
graphically
described
by
madame
octave
feuillet
as
she
witnessed
it
in
her
childhood
some
fifty
years
ago
my
parents
invited
friends
to
see
from
the
top
of
the
tower
of
jeanne
couillard
the
funeral
procession
passing
it
was
there
that
quaffing
only
refreshment
allowed
because
of
the
witnessed
at
nightfall
a
spectacle
of
which
i
shall
always
preserve
a
lively
recollection
at
our
feet
flowed
the
vire
under
its
old
stone
bridge
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
lay
the
figure
of
shrove
tuesday
on
a
litter
of
leaves
surrounded
by
scores
of
maskers
dancing
singing
and
carrying
torches
some
of
them
in
their
motley
costumes
ran
along
the
parapet
like
fiends
the
rest
worn
out
with
their
revels
sat
on
the
posts
and
dozed
soon
the
dancing
stopped
and
some
of
the
troop
seizing
a
torch
set
fire
to
the
effigy
after
which
they
flung
it
into
the
river
with
redoubled
shouts
and
clamour
the
man
of
straw
soaked
with
resin
floated
away
burning
down
the
stream
of
the
vire
lighting
up
with
its
funeral
fires
the
woods
on
the
bank
and
the
battlements
of
the
old
castle
in
which
louis
xi
and
francis
had
slept
when
the
last
glimmer
of
the
blazing
phantom
had
vanished
like
a
falling
star
at
the
end
of
the
valley
every
one
withdrew
crowd
and
maskers
alike
and
we
quitted
the
ramparts
with
our
guests
as
we
returned
home
my
father
sang
gaily
the
old
popular
song
tuesday
is
dead
and
his
wife
has
shabby
and
his
cracked
old
high
sing
low
tuesday
will
come
back
no
he
will
come
back
he
will
come
back
we
cried
warmly
clapping
our
hands
and
he
did
come
back
next
year
and
i
think
i
should
see
him
still
if
after
the
lapse
of
half
a
century
i
returned
to
the
land
of
my
in
upper
brittany
the

are
followed
by
a
funeral
procession
a
show
is
made
of
depositing
the
pretended
corpse
in
the

after
which
the
bystanders
make
believe
to
mourn
crying
out
in
melancholy
tones

poor
little
shrove

makes
a
speech

and
carried
chains

the

at

a
is

tuesday
and
thrown
into
the
river
amid
rejoicings
this
is
called
as
usual
burying
the
at
burgebrach
in
bavaria
it
used
to
be
customary
as
a
public
pastime
to
hold
a
sort
of
court
of
justice
on
ash
wednesday
the
accused
was
a
on
whom
was
laid
the
burden
of
all
the
notorious
transgressions
that
had
been
committed
in
the
course
of
the
year
twelve
chosen
maidens
sat
in
judgment
and
pronounced
sentence
and
a
single
advocate
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
public
scapegoat
finally
the
effigy
was
burnt
and
thus
all
the
offences
that
had
created
a
scandal
in
the
community
during
the
year
were
symbolically
atoned
for
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
this
custom
of
burning
a
on
ash
wednesday
for
the
sins
of
a
whole
year
is
only
another
form
of
the
custom
observed
on
the
same
day
in
so
many
other
places
of
burning
an
effigy
which
is
supposed
to
embody
and
to
be
responsible
for
all
the
excesses
committed
during
the
licence
of
the
carnival
in
greece
a
ceremony
of
the
same
sort
was
witnessed
at
pylos
by
tilton
in
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
the
greek
lent
which
fell
that
year
on
the
of
february
an
effigy
with
a
grotesque
mask
for
a
face
was
borne
about
the
streets
on
a
bier
preceded
by
a
mock
priest
with
long
white
beard
other
functionaries
surrounded
the
bier
and
two
walked
in
advance
the
procession
moved
slowly
to
melancholy
music
played
by
a
pipe
and
drum
a
final
halt
was
made
in
the
public
square
where
a
circular
space
was
kept
clear
of
the
surging
crowd
here
a
bonfire
was
kindled
and
round
it
the
priest
led
a
wild
dance
to
the
same
droning
music
when
the
frenzy
was
at
its
height
the
chief
performer
put
tow
on
the
effigy
and
set
fire
to
it
and
while
it
blazed
he
resumed
his
mad
career
brandishing
torches
and
tearing
off
his
venerable
beard
to
add
fuel
to
the
flames
on
the
evening
of
shrove
tuesday
the
esthonians
make
a
straw
figure
called
or
one
year
it
is
dressed
with
a
man
s
coat
and
hat
next
year
with
a
hood
and
a
petticoat
this
figure
is
stuck
on
a
long
pole
carried
across
the
boundary
of
the
village
with
loud
cries
of
joy
and
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
tree
in
the
wood
the
ceremony
is
believed
to
be
a
protection
against
all
kinds
of
misfortune
sometimes
at
these
shrovetide
or
lenten
ceremonies
the
resurrection
of
the
pretended
dead
person
is
enacted
thus
in
some
parts
of
swabia
on
shrove
tuesday
professes
to
bleed
a
sick
man
who
thereupon
falls
as
dead
to
the
ground
but
the
doctor
at
last
restores
him
to
life
by
blowing
air
into
him
through
a
tube
in
the
harz
mountains
when
carnival
is
over
a
man
is
laid
on
a
and
carried
with
dirges
to
a
grave
but
in
the
grave
a
glass
of
brandy
is
buried
instead
of
the
man
a
speech
is
delivered
and
then
the
people
return
to
the
or
where
they
smoke
the
long
clay
pipes
which
are
distributed
at
funerals
on
the
morning
of
shrove
tuesday
in
the
following
year
the
brandy
is
dug
up
and
the
festival
begins
by
every
one
tasting
the
spirit
which
as
the
phrase
goes
has
come
to
life
again
carrying
out
death
the
ceremony
of
carrying
out
death
presents
much
the
same
features
as
burying
the
carnival
except
that
the
carrying
out
of
death
is
generally
followed
by
a
ceremony
or
at
least
accompanied
by
a
profession
of
bringing
in
summer
spring
or
life
thus
in
middle
franken
a
province
of
bavaria
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
the
village
urchins
used
to
make
a
straw
effigy
of
death
which
they
carried
about
with
burlesque
pomp
through
the
streets
and
afterwards
burned
with
loud
cries
beyond
the
bounds
the
frankish
custom
is
thus
described
by
a
writer
of
the
sixteenth
century
at
the
season
when
the
church
bids
us
rejoice
the
young
people
of
my
native
country
make
a
straw
image
of
death
and
fastening
it
to
a
pole
carry
it
with
shouts
to
the
neighbouring
villages
by
some
they
are
kindly
received
and
after
being
refreshed
with
milk
peas
and
dried
pears
the
usual
food
of
that
season
are
sent
home
again
others
however
treat
them
with
anything
but
hospitality
for
looking
on
them
as
harbingers
of
misfortune
to
wit
of
death
they
drive
them
from
their
boundaries
with
weapons
and
in
the
villages
near
erlangen
when
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
came
round
the
peasant
girls
used
to
dress
themselves
in
all
their
finery
with
flowers
in
their
hair
thus
attired
they
repaired
to
the
neighbouring
town
carrying
puppets
which
were
adorned
with
leaves
and
covered
with
white
cloths
these
they
took
from
house
to
house
in
pairs
stopping
at
every
door
where
they
expected
to
receive
something
and
singing
a
few
lines
in
which
they
announced
that
it
was
and
that
they
were
about
to
throw
death
into
the
water
when
they
had
collected
some
trifling
gratuities
they
went
to
the
river
regnitz
and
flung
the
puppets
representing
death
into
the
stream
this
was
done
to
ensure
a
fruitful
and
prosperous
year
further
it
was
considered
a
safeguard
against
pestilence
and
sudden
death
at
nuremberg
girls
of
seven
to
eighteen
years
of
age
go
through
the
streets
bearing
a
little
open
coffin
in
which
is
a
doll
hidden
under
a
shroud
others
carry
a
beech
branch
with
an
apple
fastened
to
it
for
a
head
in
an
open
box
they
sing
we
carry
death
into
the
water
it
is
well
or
we
carry
death
into
the
water
carry
him
in
and
out
in
other
parts
of
bavaria
the
ceremony
took
place
on
the
saturday
before
the
fifth
sunday
in
lent
and
the
performers
were
boys
or
girls
according
to
the
sex
of
the
last
person
who
died
in
the
village
the
figure
was
thrown
into
water
or
buried
in
a
secret
place
for
example
under
moss
in
the
forest
that
no
one
might
find
death
again
then
early
on
sunday
morning
the
children
went
from
house
to
house
singing
a
song
in
which
they
announced
the
glad
tidings
that
death
was
gone
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
down
to
it
was
believed
that
a
fatal
epidemic
would
ensue
if
the
custom
of
carrying
out
death
were
not
observed
in
some
villages
of
thüringen
on
the
fourth
sunday
of
lent
the
children
used
to
carry
a
puppet
of
birchen
twigs
through
the
village
and
then
threw
it
into
a
pool
while
they
sang
we
carry
the
old
death
out
behind
the
herdsman

old
house
we
have
got
summer
and
kroden

or
dobschwitz
near
gera
the
ceremony
of
driving
out
death
is
or
was
annually
observed
on
the
first
of
march
the
young
people
make
up
a
figure
of
straw
or
the
like
materials
dress
it
in
old
clothes
which
they
have
begged
from
houses
in
the
village
and
carry
it
out
and
throw
it
into
the
river
on
returning
to
the
village
they
break
the
good
news
to
the
people
and
receive
eggs
and
other
victuals
as
a
reward
the
ceremony
is
or
was
supposed
to
purify
the
village
and
to
protect
the
inhabitants
from
sickness
and
plague
in
other
villages
of
thüringen
in
which
the
population
was
originally
slavonic
the
carrying
out
of
the
puppet
is
accompanied
with
the
singing
of
a
song
which
begins
now
we
carry
death
out
of
the
village
and
spring
into
the
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
and
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
custom
was
observed
in
thüringen
as
follows
the
boys
and
girls
made
an
effigy
of
straw
or
the
like
materials
but
the
shape
of
the
figure
varied
from
year
to
year
in
one
year
it
would
represent
an
old
man
in
the
next
an
old
woman
in
the
third
a
young
man
and
in
the
fourth
a
maiden
and
the
dress
of
the
figure
varied
with
the
character
it
personated
there
used
to
be
a
sharp
contest
as
to
where
the
effigy
was
to
be
made
for
the
people
thought
that
the
house
from
which
it
was
carried
forth
would
not
be
visited
with
death
that
year
having
been
made
the
puppet
was
fastened
to
a
pole
and
carried
by
a
girl
if
it
represented
an
old
man
but
by
a
boy
if
it
represented
an
old
woman
thus
it
was
borne
in
procession
the
young
people
holding
sticks
in
their
hands
and
singing
that
they
were
driving
out
death
when
they
came
to
water
they
threw
the
effigy
into
it
and
ran
hastily
back
fearing
that
it
might
jump
on
their
shoulders
and
wring
their
necks
they
also
took
care
not
to
touch
it
lest
it
should
dry
them
up
on
their
return
they
beat
the
cattle
with
the
sticks
believing
that
this
would
make
the
animals
fat
or
fruitful
afterwards
they
visited
the
house
or
houses
from
which
they
had
carried
the
image
of
death
where
they
received
a
dole
of
peas
the
custom
of
carrying
out
death
was
practised
also
in
saxony
at
leipsic
the
bastards
and
public
women
used
to
make
a
straw
effigy
of
death
every
year
at
this
they
carried
through
all
the
streets
with
songs
and
shewed
it
to
the
young
married
women
finally
they
threw
it
into
the
river
parthe
by
this
ceremony
they
professed
to
make
the
young
wives
fruitful
to
purify
the
city
and
to
protect
the
inhabitants
for
that
year
from
plague
and
other
epidemics
ceremonies
of
the
same
sort
are
observed
at
in
silesia
thus
in
many
places
the
grown
girls
with
the
help
of
the
young
men
dress
up
a
straw
figure
with
women
s
clothes
and
carry
it
out
of
the
village
towards
the
setting
sun
at
the
boundary
they
strip
it
of
its
clothes
tear
it
in
pieces
and
scatter
the
fragments
about
the
fields
this
is
called
burying
as
they
carry
the
image
out
they
sing
that
they
are
about
to
bury
death
under
an
oak
that
he
may
depart
from
the
people
sometimes
the
song
runs
that
they
are
bearing
death
over
hill
and
dale
to
return
no
more
in
the
polish
neighbourhood
of
the
puppet
is
called
goik
it
is
carried
on
horseback
and
thrown
into
the
nearest
water
the
people
think
that
the
ceremony
protects
them
from
sickness
of
every
sort
in
the
coming
year
in
the
districts
of
wohlau
and
guhrau
the
image
of
death
used
to
be
thrown
over
the
boundary
of
the
next
village
but
as
the
neighbours
feared
to
receive
the
figure
they
were
on
the
to
repel
it
and
hard
knocks
were
often
exchanged
between
the
two
parties
in
some
polish
parts
of
upper
silesia
the
effigy
representing
an
old
woman
goes
by
the
name
of
marzana
the
goddess
of
death
it
is
made
in
the
house
where
the
last
death
occurred
and
is
carried
on
a
pole
to
the
boundary
of
the
village
where
it
is
thrown
into
a
pond
or
burnt
at
polkwitz
the
custom
of
carrying
out
death
fell
into
abeyance
but
an
outbreak
of
fatal
sickness
which
followed
the
intermission
of
the
ceremony
induced
the
people
to
resume
it
some
of
the
moravians
of
silesia
make
three
puppets
on
this
occasion
one
represents
a
man
another
a
bride
and
the
third
a
bridesmaid
the
first
is
carried
by
the
boys
the
two
last
by
the
girls
formerly
these
effigies
were
torn
to
pieces
at
a
brook
now
they
are
brought
home
again
in
this
last
custom
two
of
the
figures
are
clearly
conceived
as
bride
and
bridegroom
in
bohemia
the
children
go
out
with
a
representing
death
to
the
end
of
the
village
where
they
burn
it
carry
we

of
the

into
the

little
at
tabor
in
bohemia
the
figure
of
death
is
carried
out
of
the
town
and
flung
from
a
high
rock
into
the
water
while
they
swims
on
the

will
soon
be
here
carried

for

for

other
parts
of

end
of
the

carry

out
of
the
village
the
new
year
into
the
spring
we
bid
you
welcome
grass
we
bid
you
behind
the
village
they
erect
a
pyre
on
which
they
burn
the
straw
figure
reviling
and
scoffing
at
it
the
while
then
they
return
have
carried
away
death
brought
life
has
taken
up
his
quarters
in
the
village
sing
joyous
in
some
german
villages
of
moravia
as
in
jassnitz
and
seitendorf
the
young
folk
assemble
on
the
third
sunday
in
lent
and
fashion
a
who
is
generally
adorned
with
a
fur
cap
and
a
pair
of
old
leathern
hose
if
such
are
to
be
had
the
effigy
is
then
hoisted
on
a
pole
and
carried
by
the
lads
and
lasses
out
into
the
open
fields
on
the
way
they
sing
a
song
in
which
it
is
said
that
they
are
carrying
death
away
and
bringing
dear
summer
into
the
house
and
with
summer
the
may
and
the
flowers
on
reaching
an
appointed
place
they
dance
in
a
circle
round
the
effigy
with
loud
shouts
and
screams
then
suddenly
rush
at
it
and
tear
it
to
pieces
with
their
hands
lastly
the
pieces
are
thrown
together
in
a
heap
the
pole
is
broken
and
fire
is
set
to
the
whole
while
it
burns
the
troop
dances
merrily
round
it
rejoicing
at
the
victory
won
by
spring
and
when
the
fire
has
nearly
died
out
they
go
to
the
householders
to
beg
for
a
present
of
eggs
wherewith
to
hold
a
feast
taking
care
to
give
as
a
reason
for
the
request
that
they
have
carried
death
out
and
away
the
preceding
evidence
shews
that
the
effigy
of
death
is
often
regarded
with
fear
and
treated
with
marks
of
hatred
and
abhorrence
thus
the
anxiety
of
the
villagers
to
transfer
the
figure
from
their
own
to
their
neighbours
land
and
the
reluctance
of
the
latter
to
receive
the
ominous
guest
are
proof
enough
of
the
dread
which
it
inspires
further
in
lusatia
and
silesia
the
puppet
is
sometimes
made
to
look
in
at
the
window
of
a
house
and
it
is
believed
that
some
one
in
the
house
will
die
within
the
year
unless
his
life
is
redeemed
by
the
payment
of
money
again
after
throwing
the
effigy
away
the
bearers
sometimes
run
home
lest
death
should
follow
them
and
if
one
of
them
falls
in
running
it
is
believed
that
he
will
die
within
the
year
at
chrudim
in
bohemia
the
figure
of
death
is
made
out
of
a
cross
with
a
head
and
mask
stuck
at
the
top
and
a
shirt
stretched
out
on
it
on
the
fifth
sunday
in
lent
the
boys
take
this
effigy
to
the
nearest
brook
or
pool
and
standing
in
a
line
throw
it
into
the
water
then
they
all
plunge
in
after
it
but
as
soon
as
it
is
caught
no
one
more
may
enter
the
water
the
boy
who
did
not
enter
the
water
or
entered
it
last
will
die
within
the
year
and
he
is
obliged
to
carry
the
death
back
to
the
village
the
effigy
is
then
burned
on
the
other
hand
it
is
believed
that
no
one
will
die
within
the
year
in
the
house
out
of
which
the
figure
of
death
has
been
carried
and
the
village
out
of
which
death
has
been
driven
is
sometimes
supposed
to
be
protected
against
sickness
and
plague
in
some
villages
of
austrian
silesia
on
the
saturday
before
dead
sunday
an
effigy
is
made
of
old
clothes
hay
and
straw
for
the
purpose
of
driving
death
out
of
the
village
on
sunday
the
people
armed
with
sticks
and
straps
assemble
before
the
house
where
the
figure
is
lodged
four
lads
then
draw
the
effigy
by
cords
through
the
village
amid
exultant
shouts
while
all
the
others
beat
it
with
their
sticks
and
straps
on
reaching
a
field
which
belongs
to
a
neighbouring
village
they
lay
down
the
figure
cudgel
it
soundly
and
scatter
the
fragments
over
the
field
the
people
believe
that
the
village
from
which
death
has
been
thus
carried
out
will
be
safe
from
any
infectious
disease
for
the
whole
year
in
slavonia
the
figure
of
death
is
cudgelled
and
then
rent
in
two
in
poland
the
effigy
made
of
hemp
and
straw
is
flung
into
a
pool
or
swamp
with
the
words
the
devil
take
sawing
the
old
woman
the
custom
of
sawing
the
old
woman
which
is
or
used
to
be
observed
in
italy
france
and
spain
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
is
doubtless
as
grimm
supposes
merely
another
form
of
the
custom
of
carrying
out
a
great
hideous
figure
representing
the
oldest
woman
of
the
village
was
dragged
out
and
sawn
in
two
amid
a
prodigious
noise
made
with
pots
and
pans
and
so
forth
in
palermo
the
representation
used
to
be
still
more
lifelike
at
an
old
woman
was
drawn
through
the
streets
on
a
cart
attended
by
two
men
dressed
in
the
costume
of
the
de
a
society
or
religious
order
whose
function
it
was
to
attend
and
console
prisoners
condemned
to
death
a
scaffold
was
erected
in
a
public
square
the
old
woman
mounted
it
and
two
mock
executioners
proceeded
amid
a
storm
of
huzzas
and
to
saw
through
her
neck
or
rather
through
a
bladder
of
blood
which
had
been
previously
fitted
to
it
the
blood
gushed
out
and
the
old
woman
pretended
to
swoon
and
die
the
last
of
these
mock
executions
took
place
in
in
florence
during
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
the
old
woman
was
represented
by
a
figure
stuffed
with
walnuts
and
dried
figs
and
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
ladder
at
this
effigy
was
sawn
through
the
middle
under
the
of
the
mercato
nuovo
and
as
the
dried
fruits
tumbled
out
they
were
scrambled
for
by
the
crowd
a
trace
of
the
custom
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
practice
observed
by
urchins
of
secretly
pinning
paper
ladders
to
the
shoulders
of
women
of
the
lower
classes
who
happen
to
shew
themselves
in
the
streets
on
the
morning
of
a
similar
custom
is
observed
by
urchins
in
rome
and
at
naples
on
the
first
of
april
boys
cut
strips
of
cloth
into
the
shape
of
saws
smear
them
with
gypsum
and
strike
with
their
saws
on
the
back
thus
imprinting
the
figure
of
a
saw
upon
their
clothes
at
montalto
in
calabria
boys
go
about
at
with
little
saws
made
of
cane
and
jeer
at
old
people
who
therefore
generally
stay
indoors
on
that
day
the
calabrian
women
meet
together
at
this
time
and
feast
on
figs
chestnuts
honey
and
so
forth
this
they
call
sawing
the
old
woman
reminiscence
probably
of
a
custom
like
the
old
florentine
one
in
lombardy
the
thursday
of
is
known
as
the
day
of
the
old
wives
giorno
delle
the
children
run
about
crying
out
for
the
oldest
woman
whom
they
wish
to
burn
and
failing
to
possess
themselves
of
the
original
they
make
a
puppet
representing
her
which
in
the
evening
is
consumed
on
a
bonfire
on
the
lake
of
garda
the
blaze
of
light
flaring
at
different
points
on
the
hills
produces
a
picturesque
effect
in
berry
a
region
of
central
france
the
custom
of
sawing
the
old
woman
at
used
to
be
popular
and
has
probably
not
wholly
died
out
even
now
here
the
name
of
fairs
of
the
old
wives
was
given
to
certain
fairs
held
in
lent
at
which
children
were
made
to
believe
that
they
would
see
the
old
woman
of
split
or
sawn
asunder
at
argenton
and
when
has
come
children
of
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
scour
the
streets
with
wooden
swords
pursue
the
old
crones
whom
they
meet
and
even
try
to
break
into
the
houses
where
ancient
dames
are
known
to
live
who
see
the
children
thus
engaged
say
they
are
going
to
cut
or
sabre
the
old
meantime
the
old
wives
take
care
to
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
when
the
children
of
have
gone
their
rounds
and
the
day
draws
towards
evening
they
repair
to
where
they
mould
a
rude
figure
of
an
old
woman
out
of
clay
hew
it
in
pieces
with
their
wooden
swords
and
throw
the
bits
into
the
river
at
bourges
on
the
same
day
an
effigy
representing
an
old
woman
was
formerly
sawn
in
two
on
the
crier
s
stone
in
a
public
square
about
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
same
town
and
on
the
same
day
hundreds
of
children
assembled
at
the
hospital
to
see
the
old
woman
split
or
divided
in
a
religious
service
was
held
in
the
building
on
this
occasion
which
attracted
many
idlers
in
the
streets
it
was
not
uncommon
to
hear
cries
of
let
us
cleave
the
old
wife
let
us
cleave
the
oldest
woman
of
the
ward
at
tulle
on
the
day
of
the
people
used
to
enquire
after
the
oldest
woman
in
the
town
and
to
tell
the
children
that
at
punctually
she
was
to
be
sawn
in
two
at
in
barcelona
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
boys
run
about
the
streets
some
with
saws
others
with
billets
of
wood
others
again
with
cloths
in
which
they
collect
gratuities
they
sing
a
song
in
which
it
is
said
that
they
are
looking
for
the
oldest
woman
of
the
city
for
the
purpose
of
sawing
her
in
two
in
honour
of
at
last
pretending
to
have
found
her
they
saw
something
in
two
and
burn
it
a
like
custom
is
found
amongst
the
south
slavs
in
lent
the
croats
tell
their
children
that
at
noon
an
old
woman
is
being
sawn
in
two
outside
the
gates
and
in
carniola
also
the
saying
is
current
that
at
an
old
woman
is
taken
out
of
the
village
and
sawn
in
two
the
north
slavonian
expression
for
keeping
is
that
is
sawing
the
old
in
the
graubünden
canton
of
switzerland
on
sunday
grown
people
used
to
assemble
in
the
and
there
saw
in
two
a
straw
puppet
which
they
called
winter
or
the
ugly
woman
while
the
children
in
the
streets
teased
each
other
with
wooden
saws
among
the
gypsies
of
europe
the
custom
of
sawing
the
old
woman
in
two
is
observed
in
a
very
graphic
form
not
at
but
on
the
afternoon
of
palm
sunday
the
old
woman
represented
by
a
puppet
of
straw
dressed
in
women
s
clothes
is
laid
across
a
beam
in
some
open
place
and
beaten
with
clubs
by
the
assembled
gypsies
after
which
it
is
sawn
in
two
by
a
young
man
and
a
maiden
both
of
whom
wear
a
disguise
while
the
effigy
is
being
sawn
through
the
rest
of
the
company
dance
round
it
singing
songs
of
various
sorts
the
remains
of
the
figure
are
finally
burnt
and
the
ashes
thrown
into
a
stream
the
ceremony
is
supposed
by
the
gypsies
themselves
to
be
observed
in
honour
of
a
certain
shadow
queen
hence
palm
sunday
goes
by
the
name
shadow
day
among
all
the
strolling
gypsies
of
eastern
and
southern
europe
according
to
the
popular
belief
this
shadow
queen
of
whom
the
gypsies
of
have
only
a
very
vague
and
confused
conception
vanishes
underground
at
the
appearance
of
spring
but
comes
forth
again
at
the
beginning
of
winter
to
plague
mankind
during
that
inclement
season
with
sickness
hunger
and
death
among
the
vagrant
gypsies
of
southern
hungary
the
effigy
is
regarded
as
an
expiatory
and
thank
offering
made
to
the
shadow
queen
for
having
spared
the
people
during
the
winter
in
transylvania
the
gypsies
who
live
in
tents
clothe
the
puppet
in
the
garments
of
the
woman
who
has
last
become
a
widow
the
widow
herself
gives
the
clothes
gladly
for
this
purpose
because
she
thinks
that
being
burnt
they
will
pass
into
the
possession
of
her
departed
husband
who
will
thus
have
no
excuse
for
returning
from
the
to
visit
her
the
ashes
are
thrown
by
the
transylvanian
gypsies
on
the
first
graveyard
that
they
pass
on
their
journey
in
this
gypsy
custom
the
equivalence
of
the
effigy
of
the
old
woman
to
the
effigy
of
death
in
the
customs
we
have
just
been
considering
comes
out
very
clearly
thus
strongly
confirming
the
opinion
of
grimm
that
the
practice
of
sawing
the
old
woman
is
only
another
form
of
the
practice
of
carrying
out
the
same
perhaps
may
be
said
of
a
somewhat
different
form
which
the
custom
assumes
in
parts
of
spain
and
italy
in
spain
it
is
sometimes
usual
on
ash
wednesday
to
fashion
an
effigy
of
stucco
or
pasteboard
representing
a
hideous
old
woman
with
seven
legs
wearing
a
crown
of
sorrel
and
spinach
and
holding
a
sceptre
in
her
hand
the
seven
skinny
legs
stand
for
the
seven
weeks
of
the
lenten
fast
which
begins
on
ash
wednesday
this
monster
proclaimed
queen
of
lent
amid
the
chanting
of
lugubrious
songs
is
carried
in
triumph
through
the
crowded
streets
and
public
places
on
reaching
the
principal
square
the
people
put
out
their
torches
cease
shouting
and
disperse
their
revels
are
now
ended
and
they
take
a
vow
to
hold
no
more
merry
meetings
until
all
the
legs
of
the
old
woman
have
fallen
one
by
one
and
she
has
been
beheaded
the
effigy
is
then
deposited
in
some
place
appointed
for
the
purpose
where
the
public
is
admitted
to
see
it
during
the
whole
of
lent
every
week
on
saturday
evening
one
of
the
queen
s
legs
is
pulled
off
and
on
holy
saturday
when
from
every
church
tower
the
joyous
clangour
of
the
bells
proclaims
the
glad
tidings
that
christ
is
risen
the
mutilated
body
of
the
fallen
queen
is
carried
with
great
solemnity
to
the
principal
square
and
publicly
beheaded
a
custom
of
the
same
sort
prevails
in
various
parts
of
italy
thus
in
the
abruzzi
they
hang
a
puppet
of
tow
representing
lent
to
a
cord
which
stretches
across
the
street
from
one
window
to
another
seven
feathers
are
attached
to
the
figure
and
in
its
hand
it
grasps
a
distaff
and
spindle
every
saturday
in
lent
one
of
the
seven
feathers
is
plucked
out
and
on
holy
saturday
while
the
bells
are
ringing
a
string
of
chestnuts
is
burnt
for
the
purpose
of
sending
lent
and
its
meagre
fare
to
the
devil
in
houses
too
it
is
usual
to
amuse
children
by
cutting
the
figure
of
an
old
woman
with
seven
legs
out
of
pasteboard
and
sticking
it
beside
the
chimney
the
old
woman
represents
lent
and
her
seven
legs
are
the
seven
weeks
of
the
fast
every
saturday
one
of
the
legs
is
amputated
at
the
effigy
is
cut
through
the
middle
and
the
part
of
which
the
feet
have
been
already
amputated
is
removed
sometimes
the
figure
is
stuffed
with
sweets
dried
fruits
and
halfpence
for
which
the
street
urchins
scramble
when
the
puppet
is
bisected
in
the
sorrentine
peninsula
lent
is
similarly
represented
by
the
effigy
of
a
wrinkled
old
hag
with
a
spindle
and
distaff
which
is
fastened
to
a
balcony
or
a
window
attached
to
the
figure
is
an
orange
with
as
many
feathers
stuck
into
it
as
there
are
weeks
in
lent
and
at
the
end
of
each
week
one
of
the
feathers
is
plucked
out
at
the
puppet
is
sawn
in
two
an
operation
which
is
sometimes
attended
by
a
gush
of
blood
from
a
bladder
concealed
in
the
interior
of
the
figure
any
old
women
who
shew
themselves
in
the
streets
on
that
day
are
exposed
to
jibes
and
jests
and
may
be
warned
that
they
ought
to
remain
at
home
at
castellammare
to
the
south
of
naples
an
english
lady
observed
a
rude
puppet
dangling
from
a
string
which
spanned
one
of
the
narrow
streets
of
the
old
town
being
fastened
at
either
end
high
overhead
to
the
upper
part
of
the
houses
the
puppet
about
a
foot
long
was
dressed
all
in
black
rather
like
a
nun
and
from
the
skirts
projected
five
or
six
feathers
which
bore
a
certain
resemblance
to
legs
a
peasant
being
asked
what
these
things
meant
replied
with
italian
vagueness
it
is
only
further
enquiries
however
elicited
the
information
that
at
the
end
of
every
week
in
lent
one
of
the
feather
legs
was
pulled
off
the
puppet
and
that
the
puppet
was
finally
destroyed
on
the
last
day
of
lent
bringing
in
summer
in
the
preceding
ceremonies
the
return
of
spring
summer
or
life
as
a
sequel
to
the
expulsion
of
death
is
only
implied
or
at
most
announced
in
the
following
ceremonies
it
is
plainly
enacted
thus
in
some
parts
of
bohemia
the
effigy
of
death
is
drowned
by
being
thrown
into
the
water
at
sunset
then
the
girls
go
out
into
the
wood
and
cut
down
a
young
tree
with
a
green
crown
hang
a
doll
dressed
as
a
woman
on
it
deck
the
whole
with
green
red
and
white
ribbons
and
march
in
procession
with
their
summer
into
the
village
collecting
gifts
and
swims
in
the
water
comes
to
visit
us
eggs
that
are
red
yellow
carried
death
out
of
the
village
are
carrying
summer
into
the
in
many
silesian
villages
the
figure
of
death
after
being
treated
with
respect
is
stript
of
its
clothes
and
flung
with
curses
into
the
water
or
torn
to
pieces
in
a
field
then
the
young
folk
repair
to
a
wood
cut
down
a
small
peel
the
trunk
and
deck
it
with
festoons
of
evergreens
paper
roses
painted
motley
bits
of
cloth
and
so
forth
the
tree
thus
adorned
is
called
summer
or
may
boys
carry
it
from
house
to
house
singing
appropriate
songs
and
begging
for
presents
among
their
songs
is
the
following
have
carried
death
out
are
bringing
the
dear
summer
back
summer
and
the
all
the
flowers
sometimes
they
also
bring
back
from
the
wood
a
prettily
adorned
figure
which
goes
by
the
name
of
summer
may
or
the
bride
in
the
polish
districts
it
is
called
dziewanna
the
goddess
of
spring
at
eisenach
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
young
people
used
to
fasten
a
representing
death
to
a
wheel
which
they
trundled
to
the
top
of
a
hill
then
setting
fire
to
the
figure
they
allowed
it
and
the
wheel
to
roll
down
the
slope
next
they
cut
a
tall
tricked
it
out
with
ribbons
and
set
it
up
in
the
plain
the
men
then
climbed
the
tree
to
fetch
down
the
ribbons
in
upper
lusatia
the
figure
of
death
made
of
straw
and
rags
is
dressed
in
a
veil
furnished
by
the
last
bride
and
a
shirt
provided
by
the
house
in
which
the
last
death
took
place
thus
arrayed
the
figure
is
stuck
on
the
end
of
a
long
pole
and
carried
at
full
speed
by
the
tallest
and
strongest
girl
while
the
rest
pelt
the
effigy
with
sticks
and
stones
whoever
hits
it
will
be
sure
to
live
through
the
year
in
this
way
death
is
carried
out
of
the
village
and
thrown
into
the
water
or
over
the
boundary
of
the
next
village
on
their
way
home
each
one
breaks
a
green
branch
and
carries
it
gaily
with
him
till
he
reaches
the
village
when
he
throws
it
away
sometimes
the
young
people
of
the
next
village
upon
whose
land
the
figure
has
been
thrown
run
after
them
and
hurl
it
back
not
wishing
to
have
death
among
them
hence
the
two
parties
occasionally
come
to
blows
in
these
cases
death
is
represented
by
the
puppet
which
is
thrown
away
summer
or
life
by
the
branches
or
trees
which
are
brought
back
but
sometimes
a
new
potency
of
life
seems
to
be
attributed
to
the
image
of
death
itself
and
by
a
kind
of
resurrection
it
becomes
the
instrument
of
the
general
revival
thus
in
some
parts
of
lusatia
women
alone
are
concerned
in
carrying
out
death
and
suffer
no
male
to
meddle
with
it
attired
in
mourning
which
they
wear
the
whole
day
they
make
a
puppet
of
straw
clothe
it
in
a
white
shirt
and
give
it
a
broom
in
one
hand
and
a
scythe
in
the
other
singing
songs
and
pursued
by
urchins
throwing
stones
they
carry
the
puppet
to
the
village
boundary
where
they
tear
it
in
pieces
then
they
cut
down
a
fine
tree
hang
the
shirt
on
it
and
carry
it
home
singing
on
the
feast
of
ascension
the
saxons
of
braller
a
village
of
transylvania
not
far
from
hermannstadt
observe
the
ceremony
of
carrying
out
death
in
the
following
manner
after
morning
service
all
the
repair
to
the
house
of
one
of
their
number
and
there
dress
up
the
death
this
is
done
by
tying
a
sheaf
of
corn
into
a
rough
semblance
of
a
head
and
body
while
the
arms
are
simulated
by
a
broomstick
thrust
through
it
horizontally
the
figure
is
dressed
in
the
holiday
attire
of
a
young
peasant
woman
with
a
red
hood
silver
brooches
and
a
profusion
of
ribbons
at
the
arms
and
breast
the
girls
bustle
at
their
work
for
soon
the
bells
will
be
ringing
to
vespers
and
the
death
must
be
ready
in
time
to
be
placed
at
the
open
window
that
all
the
people
may
see
it
on
their
way
to
church
when
vespers
are
over
the
moment
has
come
for
the
first
procession
with
the
death
to
begin
it
is
a
privilege
that
belongs
to
the
alone
two
of
the
older
girls
seize
the
figure
by
the
arms
and
walk
in
front
all
the
rest
follow
two
and
two
boys
may
take
no
part
in
the
procession
but
they
troop
after
it
gazing
with
admiration
at
the
beautiful
so
the
procession
goes
through
all
the
streets
of
the
village
the
girls
singing
the
old
hymn
that
mein
vater
deine
so
weit
der
himmel
ist
to
a
tune
that
differs
from
the
ordinary
one
when
the
procession
has
wound
its
way
through
every
street
the
girls
go
to
another
house
and
having
shut
the
door
against
the
eager
prying
crowd
of
boys
who
follow
at
their
heels
they
strip
the
death
and
pass
the
naked
truss
of
straw
out
of
the
window
to
the
boys
who
pounce
on
it
run
out
of
the
village
with
it
without
singing
and
fling
the
dilapidated
effigy
into
the
neighbouring
brook
this
done
the
second
scene
of
the
little
drama
begins
while
the
boys
were
carrying
away
the
death
out
of
the
village
the
girls
remained
in
the
house
and
one
of
them
is
now
dressed
in
all
the
finery
which
had
been
worn
by
the
effigy
thus
arrayed
she
is
led
in
procession
through
all
the
streets
to
the
singing
of
the
same
hymn
as
before
when
the
procession
is
over
they
all
betake
themselves
to
the
house
of
the
girl
who
played
the
leading
part
here
a
feast
awaits
them
from
which
also
the
boys
are
excluded
it
is
a
popular
belief
that
the
children
may
safely
begin
to
eat
gooseberries
and
other
fruit
after
the
day
on
which
death
has
thus
been
carried
out
for
death
which
up
to
that
time
lurked
especially
in
gooseberries
is
now
destroyed
further
they
may
now
bathe
with
impunity
out
of
doors
very
similar
is
the
ceremony
which
down
to
recent
years
was
observed
in
some
of
the
german
villages
of
moravia
boys
and
girls
met
on
the
afternoon
of
the
first
sunday
after
easter
and
together
fashioned
a
puppet
of
straw
to
represent
death
decked
with
ribbons
and
cloths
and
fastened
to
the
top
of
a
long
pole
the
effigy
was
then
borne
with
singing
and
clamour
to
the
nearest
height
where
it
was
stript
of
its
gay
attire
and
thrown
or
rolled
down
the
slope
one
of
the
girls
was
next
dressed
in
the
gauds
taken
from
the
effigy
of
death
and
with
her
at
its
head
the
procession
moved
back
to
the
village
in
some
villages
the
practice
is
to
bury
the
effigy
in
the
place
that
has
the
most
evil
reputation
of
all
the
others
throw
it
into
running
water
in
the
lusatian
ceremony
described
above
the
tree
which
is
brought
home
after
the
destruction
of
the
figure
of
death
is
plainly
equivalent
to
the
trees
or
branches
which
in
the
preceding
customs
were
brought
back
as
representatives
of
summer
or
life
after
death
had
been
thrown
away
or
destroyed
but
the
transference
of
the
shirt
worn
by
the
effigy
of
death
to
the
tree
clearly
indicates
that
the
tree
is
a
kind
of
revivification
in
a
new
form
of
the
destroyed
effigy
this
comes
out
also
in
the
transylvanian
and
moravian
customs
the
dressing
of
a
girl
in
the
clothes
worn
by
the
death
and
the
leading
her
about
the
village
to
the
same
song
which
had
been
sung
when
the
death
was
being
carried
about
shew
that
she
is
intended
to
be
a
kind
of
resuscitation
of
the
being
whose
effigy
has
just
been
destroyed
these
examples
therefore
suggest
that
the
death
whose
demolition
is
represented
in
these
ceremonies
can
not
be
regarded
as
the
purely
destructive
agent
which
we
understand
by
death
if
the
tree
which
is
brought
back
as
an
embodiment
of
the
reviving
vegetation
of
spring
is
clothed
in
the
shirt
worn
by
the
death
which
has
just
been
destroyed
the
object
certainly
can
not
be
to
check
and
counteract
the
revival
of
vegetation
it
can
only
be
to
foster
and
promote
it
therefore
the
being
which
has
just
been
be
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
a
vivifying
and
quickening
influence
which
it
can
communicate
to
the
vegetable
and
even
the
animal
world
this
ascription
of
a
virtue
to
the
figure
of
death
is
put
beyond
a
doubt
by
the
custom
observed
in
some
places
of
taking
pieces
of
the
straw
effigy
of
death
and
placing
them
in
the
fields
to
make
the
crops
grow
or
in
the
manger
to
make
the
cattle
thrive
thus
in
spachendorf
a
village
of
austrian
silesia
the
figure
of
death
made
of
straw
brushwood
and
rags
is
carried
with
wild
songs
to
an
open
place
outside
the
village
and
there
burned
and
while
it
is
burning
a
general
struggle
takes
place
for
the
pieces
which
are
pulled
out
of
the
flames
with
bare
hands
each
one
who
secures
a
fragment
of
the
effigy
ties
it
to
a
branch
of
the
largest
tree
in
his
garden
or
buries
it
in
his
field
in
the
belief
that
this
causes
the
crops
to
grow
better
in
the
troppau
district
of
austrian
silesia
the
straw
figure
which
the
boys
make
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
is
dressed
by
the
girls
in
woman
s
clothes
and
hung
with
ribbons
necklace
and
garlands
attached
to
a
long
pole
it
is
carried
out
of
the
village
followed
by
a
troop
of
young
people
of
both
sexes
who
alternately
frolic
lament
and
sing
songs
arrived
at
its
field
outside
the
figure
is
stripped
of
its
clothes
and
ornaments
then
the
crowd
rushes
at
it
and
tears
it
to
bits
scuffling
for
the
fragments
every
one
tries
to
get
a
wisp
of
the
straw
of
which
the
effigy
was
made
because
such
a
wisp
placed
in
the
manger
is
believed
to
make
the
cattle
thrive
or
the
straw
is
put
in
the
hens
nest
it
being
supposed
that
this
prevents
the
hens
from
carrying
away
their
eggs
and
makes
them
brood
much
better
the
same
attribution
of
a
fertilising
power
to
the
figure
of
death
appears
in
the
belief
that
if
the
bearers
of
the
figure
after
throwing
it
away
beat
cattle
with
their
sticks
this
will
render
the
beasts
fat
or
prolific
perhaps
the
sticks
had
been
previously
used
to
beat
the
death
and
so
had
acquired
the
fertilising
power
ascribed
to
the
effigy
we
have
seen
too
that
at
leipsic
a
straw
effigy
of
death
was
shewn
to
young
wives
to
make
them
fruitful
it
seems
hardly
possible
to
separate
from
the
the
trees
or
branches
which
are
brought
into
the
village
after
the
destruction
of
the
death
the
bearers
who
bring
them
in
profess
to
be
bringing
in
the
summer
therefore
the
trees
obviously
represent
the
summer
indeed
in
silesia
they
are
commonly
called
the
summer
or
the
may
and
the
doll
which
is
sometimes
attached
to
the
is
a
duplicate
representative
of
the
summer
just
as
the
may
is
sometimes
represented
at
the
same
time
by
a
and
a
may
lady
further
the
are
adorned
like
with
ribbons
and
so
on
like
when
large
they
are
planted
in
the
ground
and
climbed
up
and
like
when
small
they
are
carried
from
door
to
door
by
boys
or
girls
singing
songs
and
collecting
money
and
as
if
to
demonstrate
the
identity
of
the
two
sets
of
customs
the
bearers
of
the
sometimes
announce
that
they
are
bringing
in
the
summer
and
the
may
the
customs
therefore
of
bringing
in
the
may
and
bringing
in
the
summer
are
essentially
the
same
and
the
is
merely
another
form
of
the
the
only
distinction
besides
that
of
name
being
in
the
time
at
which
they
are
respectively
brought
in
for
while
the
is
usually
fetched
in
on
the
first
of
may
or
at
whitsuntide
the
is
fetched
in
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
therefore
if
the
is
an
embodiment
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
the
must
likewise
be
an
embodiment
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
but
we
have
seen
that
the
is
in
some
cases
a
revivification
of
the
effigy
of
death
it
follows
therefore
that
in
these
cases
the
effigy
called
death
must
be
an
embodiment
of
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
this
inference
is
confirmed
first
by
the
vivifying
and
fertilising
influence
which
the
fragments
of
the
effigy
of
death
are
believed
to
exercise
both
on
vegetable
and
on
animal
life
for
this
influence
as
we
saw
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
is
supposed
to
be
a
special
attribute
of
the
it
is
confirmed
secondly
by
observing
that
the
effigy
of
death
is
sometimes
decked
with
leaves
or
made
of
twigs
branches
hemp
or
a
sheaf
of
corn
and
that
sometimes
it
is
hung
on
a
little
tree
and
so
carried
about
by
girls
collecting
money
just
as
is
done
with
the
and
the
may
lady
and
with
the
and
the
doll
attached
to
it
in
short
we
are
driven
to
regard
the
expulsion
of
death
and
the
bringing
in
of
summer
as
in
some
cases
at
least
merely
another
form
of
that
death
and
revival
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
in
spring
which
we
saw
enacted
in
the
killing
and
resurrection
of
the
wild
man
the
burial
and
resurrection
of
the
carnival
is
probably
another
way
of
expressing
the
same
idea
the
interment
of
the
representative
of
the
carnival
under
a
is
natural
if
he
is
supposed
to
possess
a
quickening
and
fertilising
influence
like
that
ascribed
to
the
effigy
of
death
the
esthonians
indeed
who
carry
the
straw
figure
out
of
the
village
in
the
usual
way
on
shrove
tuesday
do
not
call
it
the
carnival
but
the
and
they
clearly
indicate
the
identity
of
the
effigy
with
the
by
fixing
it
to
the
top
of
a
tree
in
the
wood
where
it
remains
for
a
year
and
is
besought
almost
daily
with
prayers
and
offerings
to
protect
the
herds
for
like
a
true
the
is
a
patron
of
cattle
sometimes
the
is
made
of
sheaves
of
corn
thus
we
may
fairly
conjecture
that
the
names
carnival
death
and
summer
are
comparatively
late
and
inadequate
expressions
for
the
beings
personified
or
embodied
in
the
customs
with
which
we
have
been
dealing
the
very
abstractness
of
the
names
bespeaks
a
modern
origin
for
the
personification
of
times
and
seasons
like
the
carnival
and
summer
or
of
an
abstract
notion
like
death
is
hardly
primitive
but
the
ceremonies
themselves
bear
the
stamp
of
a
dateless
antiquity
therefore
we
can
hardly
help
supposing
that
in
their
origin
the
ideas
which
they
embodied
were
of
a
more
simple
and
concrete
order
the
notion
of
a
tree
perhaps
of
a
particular
kind
of
tree
for
some
savages
have
no
word
for
tree
in
general
or
even
of
an
individual
tree
is
sufficiently
concrete
to
supply
a
basis
from
which
by
a
gradual
process
of
generalisation
the
wider
idea
of
a
spirit
of
vegetation
might
be
reached
but
this
general
idea
of
vegetation
would
readily
be
confounded
with
the
season
in
which
it
manifests
itself
hence
the
substitution
of
spring
summer
or
may
for
the
or
spirit
of
vegetation
would
be
easy
and
natural
again
the
concrete
notion
of
the
dying
tree
or
dying
vegetation
would
by
a
similar
process
of
generalisation
glide
into
a
notion
of
death
in
general
so
that
the
practice
of
carrying
out
the
dying
or
dead
vegetation
in
spring
as
a
preliminary
to
its
revival
would
in
time
widen
out
into
an
attempt
to
banish
death
in
general
from
the
village
or
district
the
view
that
in
these
spring
ceremonies
death
meant
originally
the
dying
or
dead
vegetation
of
winter
has
the
high
support
of
mannhardt
and
he
confirms
it
by
the
analogy
of
the
name
death
as
applied
to
the
spirit
of
the
ripe
corn
commonly
the
spirit
of
the
ripe
corn
is
conceived
not
as
dead
but
as
old
and
hence
it
goes
by
the
name
of
the
old
man
or
the
old
woman
but
in
some
places
the
last
sheaf
cut
at
harvest
which
is
generally
believed
to
be
the
seat
of
the
corn
spirit
is
called
the
dead
one
children
are
warned
against
entering
the
because
death
sits
in
the
corn
and
in
a
game
played
by
saxon
children
in
transylvania
at
the
maize
harvest
death
is
represented
by
a
child
completely
covered
with
maize
leaves
battle
of
summer
and
winter
sometimes
in
the
popular
customs
of
the
peasantry
the
contrast
between
the
dormant
powers
of
vegetation
in
winter
and
their
awakening
vitality
in
spring
takes
the
form
of
a
dramatic
contest
between
actors
who
play
the
parts
respectively
of
winter
and
summer
thus
in
the
towns
of
sweden
on
may
day
two
troops
of
young
men
on
horseback
used
to
meet
as
if
for
mortal
combat
one
of
them
was
led
by
a
representative
of
winter
clad
in
furs
who
threw
snowballs
and
ice
in
order
to
prolong
the
cold
weather
the
other
troop
was
commanded
by
a
representative
of
summer
covered
with
fresh
leaves
and
flowers
in
the
sham
fight
which
followed
the
party
of
summer
came
off
victorious
and
the
ceremony
ended
with
a
feast
again
in
the
region
of
the
middle
rhine
a
representative
of
summer
clad
in
ivy
combats
a
representative
of
winter
clad
in
straw
or
moss
and
finally
gains
a
victory
over
him
the
vanquished
foe
is
thrown
to
the
ground
and
stripped
of
his
casing
of
straw
which
is
torn
to
pieces
and
scattered
about
while
the
youthful
comrades
of
the
two
champions
sing
a
song
to
commemorate
the
defeat
of
winter
by
summer
afterwards
they
carry
about
a
summer
garland
or
branch
and
collect
gifts
of
eggs
and
bacon
from
house
to
house
sometimes
the
champion
who
acts
the
part
of
summer
is
dressed
in
leaves
and
flowers
and
wears
a
chaplet
of
flowers
on
his
head
in
the
palatinate
this
mimic
conflict
takes
place
on
the
fourth
sunday
in
lent
all
over
bavaria
the
same
drama
used
to
be
acted
on
the
same
day
and
it
was
still
kept
up
in
some
places
down
to
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
or
later
while
summer
appeared
clad
all
in
green
decked
with
fluttering
ribbons
and
carrying
a
branch
in
blossom
or
a
little
tree
hung
with
apples
and
pears
winter
was
muffled
up
in
cap
and
mantle
of
fur
and
bore
in
his
hand
a
or
a
flail
accompanied
by
their
respective
retinues
dressed
in
corresponding
attire
they
went
through
all
the
streets
of
the
village
halting
before
the
houses
and
singing
staves
of
old
songs
for
which
they
received
presents
of
bread
eggs
and
fruit
finally
after
a
short
struggle
winter
was
beaten
by
summer
and
ducked
in
the
village
well
or
driven
out
of
the
village
with
shouts
and
laughter
into
the
forest
in
some
parts
of
bavaria
the
boys
who
play
the
parts
of

and
summer
act
their
little
drama
in
every

that
they
visit
and
engage
in
a
war
of
words
before
they
come

with
great
delight
the

is
acted
every

at

rush
singing

singing
softly
and

by

all
in
bright
dresses
and
decked
with
flowers
and
garlands
to
represent
the
genial
advent
of

formerly
the
part
of

was
played
by
a
which
the

carried
with

man
in

here
on
a
day
in

about
the
time
of
the
vernal
equinox
an
elderly
man
with

is
muffled
in

in

punctuating
his
discourse
with
his
flail
which
he
brings
down
with
rude
vigour
on
the
backs
of
all
within
reach
amongst
the
slavonic
population
near
ungarisch
brod
in
moravia
the
ceremony
took
a
somewhat
different
form
girls
dressed
in
green
marched
in
procession
round
a
then
two
others
one
in
white
and
one
in
green
stepped
up
to
the
tree
and
engaged
in
a
dialogue
finally
the
girl
in
white
was
driven
away
but
returned
afterwards
clothed
in
green
and
the
festival
ended
with
a
dance
on
may
day
it
used
to
be
customary
in
almost
all
the
large
parishes
of
the
isle
of
man
to
choose
from
among
the
daughters
of
the
wealthiest
farmers
a
young
maiden
to
be
queen
of
may
she
was
dressed
in
the
gayest
attire
and
attended
by
about
twenty
others
who
were
called
maids
of
honour
she
had
also
a
young
man
for
her
captain
with
a
number
of
inferior
officers
under
him
in
opposition
to
her
was
the
queen
of
winter
a
man
attired
as
a
woman
with
woollen
hoods
fur
tippets
and
loaded
with
the
warmest
and
heaviest
clothes
one
upon
another
her
attendants
were
habited
in
like
manner
and
she
too
had
a
captain
and
troop
for
her
defence
thus
representing
respectively
the
beauty
of
spring
and
the
deformity
of
winter
they
set
forth
from
their
different
quarters
the
one
preceded
by
the
dulcet
music
of
flutes
and
violins
the
other
by
the
harsh
clatter
of
cleavers
and
tongs
in
this
array
they
marched
till
they
met
on
a
common
where
the
trains
of
the
two
mimic
sovereigns
engaged
in
a
mock
battle
if
the
queen
of
winter
s
forces
got
the
better
of
their
adversaries
and
took
her
rival
prisoner
the
captive
queen
of
summer
was
ransomed
for
as
much
as
would
pay
the
expenses
of
the
festival
after
this
ceremony
winter
and
her
company
retired
and
diverted
themselves
in
a
barn
while
the
partisans
of
summer
danced
on
the
green
concluding
the
evening
with
a
feast
at
which
the
queen
and
her
maids
sat
at
one
table
and
the
captain
and
his
troop
at
another
in
later
times
the
person
of
the
queen
of
may
was
exempt
from
capture
but
one
of
her
slippers
was
substituted
and
if
captured
had
to
be
ransomed
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
pageant
the
procession
of
the
summer
which
was
subsequently
composed
of
little
girls
and
called
the
maceboard
outlived
that
of
its
rival
the
winter
for
some
years
but
both
have
now
long
been
things
of
the
past

the
central
esquimaux
of
north
america
the
contest
between
representatives
of
summer
and
winter
which
in
europe
has
long
degenerated
into
a
mere
dramatic
performance
is
still
kept
up
as
a
magical
ceremony
of
which
the
avowed
intention
is
to
influence
the
weather
in
autumn
when
storms
announce
the
approach
of
the
dismal
arctic
winter
the
esquimaux
divide
themselves
into
two
parties
called
respectively
the
ptarmigans
and
the
ducks
the
ptarmigans
comprising
all
persons
born
in
winter
and
the
ducks
all
persons
born
in
summer
a
long
rope
of
sealskin
is
then
stretched
out
and
each
party
laying
hold
of
one
end
of
it
seeks
by
tugging
with
might
and
main
to
drag
the
other
party
over
to
its
side
if
the
ptarmigans
get
the
worst
of
it
then
summer
has
won
the
game
and
fine
weather
may
be
expected
to
prevail
through
the
winter
in
this
ceremony
it
is
clearly
assumed
that
persons
born
in
summer
have
a
natural
affinity
with
warm
weather
and
therefore
possess
a
power
of
mitigating
the
rigour
of
winter
whereas
persons
born
in
winter
are
so
to
say
of
a
cold
and
frosty
disposition
and
can
thereby
exert
a
refrigerating
influence
on
the
temperature
of
the
air
in
spite
of
this
natural
antipathy
between
the
representatives
of
summer
and
winter
we
may
be
allowed
to
conjecture
that
in
the
grand
tug
of
war
the
ptarmigans
do
not
pull
at
the
rope
with
the
same
hearty
goodwill
as
the
ducks
and
that
thus
the
genial
influence
of
summer
commonly
prevails
over
the
harsh
austerity
of
winter
the
indians
of
canada
seem
also
to
have
imagined
that
persons
are
endowed
with
distinct
natural
capacities
according
as
they
are
born
in
summer
or
winter
and
they
turned
the
distinction
to
account
in
much
the
same
fashion
as
the
esquimaux
when
they
wearied
of
the
long
frosts
and
the
deep
snow
which
kept
them
prisoners
in
their
huts
and
prevented
them
from
hunting
all
of
them
who
were
born
in
summer
rushed
out
of
their
houses
armed
with
burning
brands
and
torches
which
they
hurled
against
the
one
who
makes
winter
and
this
was
supposed
to
produce
the
desired
effect
of
mitigating
the
cold
but
those
indians
who
were
born
in
winter
abstained
from
taking
part
in
the
ceremony
for
they
believed
that
if
they
meddled
with
it
the
cold
would
increase
instead
of
diminishing
we
may
surmise
that
in
the
corresponding
european
ceremonies
which
have
just
been
described
it
was
formerly
deemed
necessary
that
the
actors
who
played
the
parts
of
winter
and
summer
should
have
been
born
in
the
seasons
which
they
personated
every
year
on
the
monday
after
the
spring
equinox
boys
and
girls
attired
in
gay
costume
flock
at
a
very
early
hour
into
zurich
from
the
country
the
girls
generally
clad
in
white
are
called
and
carry
two
and
two
a
small
may
tree
or
a
wreath
decked
with
flowers
and
ribbons
thus
they
go
in
bands
from
house
to
house
jingling
the
bells
which
are
attached
to
the
wreath
and
singing
a
song
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
dance
because
the
leaves
and
the
grass
are
green
and
everything
is
bursting
into
blossom
in
this
way
they
are
supposed
to
celebrate
the
triumph
of
summer
and
to
proclaim
his
coming
the
boys
are
called
they
generally
wear
over
their
ordinary
clothes
a
shirt
decked
with
ribbons
tall
pointed
paper
caps
on
their
heads
and
masks
before
their
faces
in
this
quaint
costume
they
cart
about
through
the
streets
effigies
made
of
straw
and
other
combustible
materials
which
are
supposed
to
represent
winter
at
evening
these
effigies
are
burned
in
various
parts
of
the
city
the
ceremony
was
witnessed
at
zurich
on
monday
april
by
my
friend
sutherland
black
who
has
kindly
furnished
me
with
some
notes
on
the
subject
the
effigy
of
winter
was
a
gigantic
figure
composed
in
great
part
as
it
seemed
of
this
was
laid
on
a
huge
pyre
about
thirty
feet
high
which
had
been
erected
on
the
stadthausplatz
close
to
the
lake
in
presence
of
a
vast
concourse
of
people
fire
was
set
to
the
pyre
and
all
was
soon
in
a
blaze
while
the
town
bells
rang
a
joyous
peal
as
the
figure
gradually
consumed
in
the
flames
the
mechanism
enclosed
in
its
interior
produced
a
variety
of
grotesque
effects
such
as
the
gushing
forth
of
bowels
at
last
nothing
remained
of
the
effigy
but
the
iron
backbone
the
crowd
slowly
dispersed
and
the
fire
brigade
set
to
work
to
quench
the
smouldering
embers
in
this
ceremony
the
contest
between
summer
and
winter
is
rather
implied
than
expressed
but
the
significance
of
the
rite
is
unmistakable
death
and
resurrection
of
kostrubonko
in
russia
funeral
ceremonies
like
those
of
burying
the
carnival
and
carrying
out
death
are
celebrated
under
the
names
not
of
death
or
the
carnival
but
of
certain
mythic
figures
kostrubonko
kostroma
kupalo
lada
and
yarilo
these
russian
ceremonies
are
observed
both
in
spring
and
at
midsummer
thus
in
little
russia
it
used
to
be
the
custom
at
eastertide
to
celebrate
the
funeral
of
a
being
called
kostrubonko
the
deity
of
the
spring
a
circle
was
formed
of
singers
who
moved
slowly
around
a
girl
who
lay
on
the
ground
as
if
dead
and
as
they
went
they
sang
dead
is
our
kostrubonko
dead
is
our
dear
one
until
the
girl
suddenly
sprang
up
on
which
the
chorus
joyfully
exclaimed
to
life
come
to
life
has
our
kostrubonko
to
life
come
to
life
has
our
dear
one
on
the
eve
of
john
midsummer
eve
a
figure
of
kupalo
is
made
of
straw
and
is
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
with
a
necklace
and
a
floral
crown
then
a
tree
is
felled
and
after
being
decked
with
ribbons
is
set
up
on
some
chosen
spot
near
this
tree
to
which
they
give
the
name
of
marena
winter
or
death
the
straw
figure
is
placed
together
with
a
table
on
which
stand
spirits
and
viands
afterwards
a
bonfire
is
lit
and
the
young
men
and
maidens
jump
over
it
in
couples
carrying
the
figure
with
them
on
the
next
day
they
strip
the
tree
and
the
figure
of
their
ornaments
and
throw
them
both
into
a
on
peter
s
day
the
of
june
or
on
the
following
sunday
the
funeral
of
kostroma
or
of
lada
or
of
yarilo
is
celebrated
in
russia
in
the
governments
of
penza
and
simbirsk
the
funeral
used
to
be
represented
as
follows
a
bonfire
was
kindled
on
the
of
june
and
on
the
next
day
the
maidens
chose
one
of
their
number
to
play
the
part
of
kostroma
her
companions
saluted
her
with
deep
obeisances
placed
her
on
a
board
and
carried
her
to
the
bank
of
a
stream
there
they
bathed
her
in
the
water
while
the
oldest
girl
made
a
basket
of
bark
and
beat
it
like
a
drum
then
they
returned
to
the
village
and
ended
the
day
with
processions
games
and
dances
in
the
murom
district
kostroma
was
represented
by
a
straw
figure
dressed
in
woman
s
clothes
and
flowers
this
was
laid
in
a
trough
and
carried
with
songs
to
the
bank
of
a
lake
or
river
here
the
crowd
divided
into
two
sides
of
which
the
one
attacked
and
the
other
defended
the
figure
at
last
the
assailants
gained
the
day
stripped
the
figure
of
its
dress
and
ornaments
tore
it
in
pieces
trod
the
straw
of
which
it
was
made
under
foot
and
flung
it
into
the
stream
while
the
defenders
of
the
figure
hid
their
faces
in
their
hands
and
pretended
to
bewail
the
death
of
kostroma
in
the
district
of
kostroma
the
burial
of
yarilo
was
celebrated
on
the
or
thirtieth
of
june
the
people
chose
an
old
man
and
gave
him
a
small
coffin
containing
a
figure
representing
yarilo
this
he
carried
out
of
the
town
followed
by
women
chanting
dirges
and
expressing
by
their
gestures
grief
and
despair
in
the
open
fields
a
grave
was
dug
and
into
it
the
figure
was
lowered
amid
weeping
and
wailing
after
which
games
and
dances
were
begun
calling
to
mind
the
funeral
games
celebrated
in
old
times
by
the
pagan
in
little
russia
the
figure
of
yarilo
was
laid
in
a
coffin
and
carried
through
the
streets
after
sunset
surrounded
by
drunken
women
who
kept
repeating
mournfully
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
the
men
lifted
and
shook
the
figure
as
if
they
were
trying
to
recall
the
dead
man
to
life
then
they
said
to
the
women
women
weep
not
i
know
what
is
sweeter
than
but
the
women
continued
to
lament
and
chant
as
they
do
at
funerals
of
what
was
he
guilty
he
was
so
good
he
will
arise
no
more
o
how
shall
we
part
from
thee
what
is
life
without
thee
arise
if
only
for
a
brief
hour
but
he
rises
not
he
rises
at
last
the
yarilo
was
buried
in
a
grave
death
and
revival
of
vegetation
these
russian
customs
are
plainly
of
the
same
nature
as
those
which
in
austria
and
germany
are
known
as
carrying
out
therefore
if
the
interpretation
here
adopted
of
the
latter
is
right
the
russian
kostrubonko
yarilo
and
the
rest
must
also
have
been
originally
embodiments
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
and
their
death
must
have
been
regarded
as
a
necessary
preliminary
to
their
revival
the
revival
as
a
sequel
to
the
death
is
enacted
in
the
first
of
the
ceremonies
described
the
death
and
resurrection
of
kostrubonko
the
reason
why
in
some
of
these
russian
ceremonies
the
death
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
is
celebrated
at
midsummer
may
be
that
the
decline
of
summer
is
dated
from
midsummer
day
after
which
the
days
begin
to
shorten
and
the
sun
sets
out
on
his
downward
the
darksome
the
frosts
of
winter
such
a
of
the
year
when
vegetation
might
be
thought
to
share
the
incipient
though
still
almost
imperceptible
decay
of
summer
might
very
well
be
chosen
by
primitive
man
as
a
fit
moment
for
resorting
to
those
magic
rites
by
which
he
hopes
to
stay
the
decline
or
at
least
to
ensure
the
revival
of
plant
life
but
while
the
death
of
vegetation
appears
to
have
been
represented
in
all
and
its
revival
in
some
of
these
spring
and
midsummer
ceremonies
there
are
features
in
some
of
them
which
can
hardly
be
explained
on
this
hypothesis
alone
the
solemn
funeral
the
lamentations
and
the
mourning
attire
which
often
characterise
these
rites
are
indeed
appropriate
at
the
death
of
the
beneficent
spirit
of
vegetation
but
what
shall
we
say
of
the
glee
with
which
the
effigy
is
often
carried
out
of
the
sticks
and
stones
with
which
it
is
assailed
and
the
taunts
and
curses
which
are
hurled
at
it
what
shall
we
say
of
the
dread
of
the
effigy
evinced
by
the
haste
with
which
the
bearers
scamper
home
as
soon
as
they
have
thrown
it
away
and
by
the
belief
that
some
one
must
soon
die
in
any
house
into
which
it
has
looked
this
dread
might
perhaps
be
explained
by
a
belief
that
there
is
a
certain
infectiousness
in
the
dead
spirit
of
vegetation
which
renders
its
approach
dangerous
but
this
explanation
besides
being
rather
strained
does
not
cover
the
rejoicings
which
often
attend
the
carrying
out
of
death
we
must
therefore
recognise
two
distinct
and
seemingly
opposite
features
in
these
ceremonies
on
the
one
hand
sorrow
for
the
death
and
affection
and
respect
for
the
dead
on
the
other
hand
fear
and
hatred
of
the
dead
and
rejoicings
at
his
death
how
the
former
of
these
features
is
to
be
explained
i
have
attempted
to
shew
how
the
latter
came
to
be
so
closely
associated
with
the
former
is
a
question
which
i
shall
try
to
answer
in
the
sequel
before
we
quit
these
european
customs
to
go
farther
afield
it
will
be
well
to
notice
that
occasionally
the
expulsion
of
death
or
of
a
mythic
being
is
conducted
without
any
visible
representative
of
the
personage
expelled
thus
at
königshain
near
görlitz
in
silesia
all
the
villagers
young
and
old
used
to
go
out
with
straw
torches
to
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
hill
called
where
they
lit
their
torches
and
so
returned
home
singing
we
have
driven
out
death
we
are
bringing
back
in
albania
young
people
light
torches
of
resinous
wood
on
easter
eve
and
march
in
procession
through
the
village
brandishing
them
at
last
they
throw
the
torches
into
the
river
saying
ha
kore
we
fling
you
into
the
river
like
these
torches
that
you
may
return
no
some
say
that
the
intention
of
the
ceremony
is
to
drive
out
winter
but
kore
is
conceived
as
a
malignant
being
who
devours
children
analogous
rites
in
india
in
the
kanagra
district
of
india
there
is
a
custom
observed
by
young
girls
in
spring
which
closely
resembles
some
of
the
european
spring
ceremonies
just
described
it
is
called
the
ka
or
fair
of
ralî
the
being
a
small
painted
earthen
image
of
siva
or
pârvatî
the
custom
is
in
vogue
all
over
the
kanagra
district
and
its
celebration
which
is
entirely
confined
to
young
girls
lasts
through
most
of
chet
up
to
the
sankrânt
of
baisâkh
april
on
a
morning
in
march
all
the
young
girls
of
the
village
take
small
baskets
of
grass
and
flowers
to
an
appointed
place
where
they
throw
them
in
a
heap
round
this
heap
they
stand
in
a
circle
and
sing
this
goes
on
every
day
for
ten
days
till
the
heap
of
grass
and
flowers
has
reached
a
fair
height
then
they
cut
in
the
jungle
two
branches
each
with
three
prongs
at
one
end
and
place
them
prongs
downwards
over
the
heap
of
flowers
so
as
to
make
two
tripods
or
pyramids
on
the
single
uppermost
points
of
these
branches
they
get
an
to
construct
two
clay
images
one
to
represent
siva
and
the
other
pârvatî
the
girls
then
divide
themselves
into
two
parties
one
for
siva
and
one
for
pârvatî
and
marry
the
images
in
the
usual
way
leaving
out
no
part
of
the
ceremony
after
the
marriage
they
have
a
feast
the
cost
of
which
is
defrayed
by
contributions
solicited
from
their
parents
then
at
the
next
sankrânt
baisâkh
they
all
go
together
to
the
throw
the
images
into
a
deep
pool
and
weep
over
the
place
as
though
they
were
performing
funeral
obsequies
the
boys
of
the
neighbourhood
often
tease
them
by
diving
after
the
images
bringing
them
up
and
waving
them
about
while
the
girls
are
crying
over
them
the
object
of
the
fair
is
said
to
be
to
secure
a
good
husband
that
in
this
indian
ceremony
the
deities
siva
and
pârvatî
are
conceived
as
spirits
of
vegetation
seems
to
be
proved
by
the
placing
of
their
images
on
branches
over
a
heap
of
grass
and
flowers
here
as
often
in
european
the
divinities
of
vegetation
are
represented
in
duplicate
by
plants
and
by
puppets
the
marriage
of
these
indian
deities
in
spring
corresponds
to
the
european
ceremonies
in
which
the
marriage
of
the
vernal
spirits
of
vegetation
is
represented
by
the
king
and
queen
of
may
the
may
bride
bridegroom
of
the
may
and
so
forth
the
throwing
of
the
images
into
the
water
and
the
mourning
for
them
are
the
equivalents
of
the
european
customs
of
throwing
the
dead
spirit
of
vegetation
under
the
name
of
death
yarilo
kostroma
and
the
rest
into
the
water
and
lamenting
over
it
again
in
india
as
often
in
europe
the
rite
is
performed
exclusively
by
females
the
notion
that
the
ceremony
helps
to
procure
husbands
for
the
girls
can
be
explained
by
the
quickening
and
fertilising
influence
which
the
spirit
of
vegetation
is
believed
to
exert
upon
the
life
of
man
as
well
as
of
plants
the
magic
spring
the
general
explanation
which
we
have
been
led
to
adopt
of
these
and
many
similar
ceremonies
is
that
they
are
or
were
in
their
origin
magical
rites
intended
to
ensure
the
revival
of
nature
in
spring
the
means
by
which
they
were
supposed
to
effect
this
end
were
imitation
and
sympathy
led
astray
by
his
ignorance
of
the
true
causes
of
things
primitive
man
believed
that
in
order
to
produce
the
great
phenomena
of
nature
on
which
his
life
depended
he
had
only
to
imitate
them
and
that
immediately
by
a
secret
sympathy
or
mystic
influence
the
little
drama
which
he
acted
in
forest
glade
or
mountain
dell
on
desert
plain
or
shore
would
be
taken
up
and
repeated
by
mightier
actors
on
a
vaster
stage
he
fancied
that
by
masquerading
in
leaves
and
flowers
he
helped
the
bare
earth
to
clothe
herself
with
verdure
and
that
by
playing
the
death
and
burial
of
winter
he
drove
that
gloomy
season
away
and
made
smooth
the
path
for
the
footsteps
of
returning
spring
if
we
find
it
hard
to
throw
ourselves
even
in
fancy
into
a
mental
condition
in
which
such
things
seem
possible
we
can
more
easily
picture
to
ourselves
the
anxiety
which
the
savage
when
he
first
began
to
lift
his
thoughts
above
the
satisfaction
of
his
merely
animal
wants
and
to
meditate
on
the
causes
of
things
may
have
felt
as
to
the
continued
operation
of
what
we
now
call
the
laws
of
nature
to
us
familiar
as
we
are
with
the
conception
of
the
uniformity
and
regularity
with
which
the
great
cosmic
phenomena
succeed
each
other
there
seems
little
ground
for
apprehension
that
the
causes
which
produce
these
effects
will
cease
to
operate
at
least
within
the
near
future
but
this
confidence
in
the
stability
of
nature
is
bred
only
by
the
experience
which
comes
of
wide
observation
and
long
tradition
and
the
savage
with
his
narrow
sphere
of
observation
and
his
tradition
lacks
the
very
elements
of
that
experience
which
alone
could
set
his
mind
at
rest
in
face
of
the
and
often
menacing
aspects
of
nature
no
wonder
therefore
that
he
is
thrown
into
a
panic
by
an
eclipse
and
thinks
that
the
sun
or
the
moon
would
surely
perish
if
he
did
not
raise
a
clamour
and
shoot
his
puny
shafts
into
the
air
to
defend
the
luminaries
from
the
monster
who
threatens
to
devour
them
no
wonder
he
is
terrified
when
in
the
darkness
of
night
a
streak
of
sky
is
suddenly
illumined
by
the
flash
of
a
meteor
or
the
whole
expanse
of
the
celestial
arch
glows
with
the
fitful
light
of
the
northern
streamers
even
phenomena
which
recur
at
fixed
and
uniform
intervals
may
be
viewed
by
him
with
apprehension
before
he
has
come
to
recognise
the
orderliness
of
their
recurrence
the
speed
or
slowness
of
his
recognition
of
such
periodic
or
cyclic
changes
in
nature
will
depend
largely
on
the
length
of
the
particular
cycle
the
cycle
for
example
of
day
and
night
is
everywhere
except
in
the
polar
regions
so
short
and
hence
so
frequent
that
men
probably
soon
ceased
to
discompose
themselves
seriously
as
to
the
chance
of
its
failing
to
recur
though
the
ancient
egyptians
as
we
have
seen
daily
wrought
enchantments
to
bring
back
to
the
east
in
the
morning
the
fiery
orb
which
had
sunk
at
evening
in
the
crimson
west
but
it
was
far
otherwise
with
the
annual
cycle
of
the
seasons
to
any
man
a
year
is
a
considerable
period
seeing
that
the
number
of
our
years
is
but
few
at
the
best
to
the
primitive
savage
with
his
short
memory
and
imperfect
means
of
marking
the
flight
of
time
a
year
may
well
have
been
so
long
that
he
failed
to
recognise
it
as
a
cycle
at
all
and
watched
the
changing
aspects
of
earth
and
heaven
with
a
perpetual
wonder
alternately
delighted
and
alarmed
elated
and
cast
down
according
as
the
vicissitudes
of
light
and
heat
of
plant
and
animal
life
ministered
to
his
comfort
or
threatened
his
existence
in
autumn
when
the
withered
leaves
were
whirled
about
the
forest
by
the
nipping
blast
and
he
looked
up
at
the
bare
boughs
could
he
feel
sure
that
they
would
ever
be
green
again
as
day
by
day
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
in
the
sky
could
he
be
certain
that
the
luminary
would
ever
retrace
his
heavenly
road
even
the
waning
moon
whose
pale
sickle
rose
thinner
and
thinner
every
night
over
the
rim
of
the
eastern
horizon
may
have
excited
in
his
mind
a
fear
lest
when
it
had
wholly
vanished
there
should
be
moons
no
more
these
and
a
thousand
such
misgivings
may
have
thronged
the
fancy
and
troubled
the
peace
of
the
man
who
first
began
to
reflect
on
the
mysteries
of
the
world
he
lived
in
and
to
take
thought
for
a
more
distant
future
than
the
morrow
it
was
natural
therefore
that
with
such
thoughts
and
fears
he
should
have
done
all
that
in
him
lay
to
bring
back
the
faded
blossom
to
the
bough
to
swing
the
low
sun
of
winter
up
to
his
old
place
in
the
summer
sky
and
to
restore
its
orbed
fulness
to
the
silver
lamp
of
the
waning
moon
we
may
smile
at
his
vain
endeavours
if
we
please
but
it
was
only
by
making
a
long
series
of
experiments
of
which
some
were
almost
inevitably
doomed
to
failure
that
man
learned
from
experience
the
futility
of
some
of
his
attempted
methods
and
the
fruitfulness
of
others
after
all
magical
ceremonies
are
nothing
but
experiments
which
have
failed
and
which
continue
to
be
repeated
merely
because
for
reasons
which
have
already
been
indicated
the
operator
is
unaware
of
their
failure
with
the
advance
of
knowledge
these
ceremonies
either
cease
to
be
performed
altogether
or
are
kept
up
from
force
of
habit
long
after
the
intention
with
which
they
were
instituted
has
been
forgotten
thus
fallen
from
their
high
estate
no
longer
regarded
as
solemn
rites
on
the
punctual
performance
of
which
the
welfare
and
even
the
life
of
the
community
depend
they
sink
gradually
to
the
level
of
simple
pageants
mummeries
and
pastimes
till
in
the
final
stage
of
degeneration
they
are
wholly
abandoned
by
older
people
and
from
having
once
been
the
most
serious
occupation
of
the
sage
become
at
last
the
idle
sport
of
children
it
is
in
this
final
stage
of
decay
that
most
of
the
old
magical
rites
of
our
european
forefathers
linger
on
at
the
present
day
and
even
from
this
their
last
retreat
they
are
fast
being
swept
away
by
the
rising
tide
of
those
multitudinous
forces
moral
intellectual
and
social
which
are
bearing
mankind
onward
to
a
new
and
unknown
goal
we
may
feel
some
natural
regret
at
the
disappearance
of
quaint
customs
and
picturesque
ceremonies
which
have
preserved
to
an
age
often
deemed
dull
and
prosaic
something
of
the
flavour
and
freshness
of
the
olden
time
some
breath
of
the
springtime
of
the
world
yet
our
regret
will
be
lessened
when
we
remember
that
these
pretty
pageants
these
now
innocent
diversions
had
their
origin
in
ignorance
and
superstition
that
if
they
are
a
record
of
human
endeavour
they
are
also
a
monument
of
fruitless
ingenuity
of
wasted
labour
and
of
blighted
hopes
and
that
for
all
their
gay
flowers
their
ribbons
and
their
partake
far
more
of
tragedy
than
of
farce
the
interpretation
which
following
in
the
footsteps
of
mannhardt
i
have
attempted
to
give
of
these
ceremonies
has
been
not
a
little
confirmed
by
the
discovery
made
since
this
book
was
first
written
that
the
natives
of
central
australia
regularly
practise
magical
ceremonies
for
the
purpose
of
awakening
the
dormant
energies
of
nature
at
the
approach
of
what
may
be
called
the
australian
spring
nowhere
apparently
are
the
alternations
of
the
seasons
more
sudden
and
the
contrasts
between
them
more
striking
than
in
the
deserts
of
central
australia
where
at
the
end
of
a
long
period
of
drought
the
sandy
and
stony
wilderness
over
which
the
silence
and
desolation
of
death
appear
to
brood
is
suddenly
after
a
few
days
of
torrential
rain
transformed
into
a
landscape
smiling
with
verdure
and
peopled
with
teeming
multitudes
of
insects
and
lizards
of
frogs
and
birds
the
marvellous
change
which
passes
over
the
face
of
nature
at
such
times
has
been
compared
even
by
european
observers
to
the
effect
of
magic
no
wonder
then
that
the
savage
should
regard
it
as
such
in
very
deed
now
it
is
just
when
there
is
promise
of
the
approach
of
a
good
season
that
the
natives
of
central
australia
are
wont
especially
to
perform
those
magical
ceremonies
of
which
the
avowed
intention
is
to
multiply
the
plants
and
animals
they
use
as
food
these
ceremonies
therefore
present
a
close
analogy
to
the
spring
customs
of
our
european
peasantry
not
only
in
the
time
of
their
celebration
but
also
in
their
aim
for
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
in
instituting
rites
designed
to
assist
the
revival
of
plant
life
in
spring
our
primitive
forefathers
were
moved
not
by
any
sentimental
wish
to
smell
at
early
violets
or
pluck
the
rathe
primrose
or
watch
yellow
daffodils
dancing
in
the
breeze
but
by
the
very
practical
consideration
certainly
not
formulated
in
abstract
terms
that
the
life
of
man
is
inextricably
bound
up
with
that
of
plants
and
that
if
they
were
to
perish
he
could
not
survive
and
as
the
faith
of
the
australian
savage
in
the
efficacy
of
his
magic
rites
is
confirmed
by
observing
that
their
performance
is
invariably
followed
sooner
or
later
by
that
increase
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
which
it
is
their
object
to
produce
so
we
may
suppose
it
was
with
european
savages
in
the
olden
time
the
sight
of
the
fresh
green
in
brake
and
thicket
of
vernal
flowers
blowing
on
mossy
banks
of
swallows
arriving
from
the
south
and
of
the
sun
mounting
daily
higher
in
the
sky
would
be
welcomed
by
them
as
so
many
visible
signs
that
their
enchantments
were
indeed
taking
effect
and
would
inspire
them
with
a
cheerful
confidence
that
all
was
well
with
a
world
which
they
could
thus
mould
to
suit
their
wishes
only
in
autumn
days
as
summer
slowly
faded
would
their
confidence
again
be
dashed
by
doubts
and
misgivings
at
symptoms
of
decay
which
told
how
vain
were
all
their
efforts
to
stave
off
for
ever
the
approach
of
winter
and
of
death

chinese
indifference

lord
avebury
kindly
allows
me
to
print
the
letter
of
lampson
referred
to
above
note
it
runs
as
follows
foreign
office
dear
lord
the
result
of
enquiries
i
hear
from
a
eames
a
lawyer
who
practised
for
some
years
at
shanghai
and
has
considerable
knowledge
of
chinese
matters
that
for
a
small
sum
a
substitute
can
be
found
for
execution
this
is
recognised
by
the
chinese
authorities
with
certain
exceptions
as
for
instance
parricide
it
is
even
asserted
that
the
local
taotai
gains
pecuniarily
by
this
arrangement
as
he
is
as
a
rule
not
above
obtaining
a
substitute
for
the
condemned
man
for
a
less
sum
than
was
paid
him
by
the
latter
it
is
i
believe
part
of
the
doctrine
of
confucius
that
it
is
one
of
the
highest
virtues
to
increase
the
family
prosperity
at
the
expense
of
personal
suffering
according
to
eames
the
chinamen
looks
upon
execution
in
another
man
s
stead
in
this
light
and
consequently
there
is
quite
a
competition
for
such
a
should
you
wish

get

on

i
will
ask
him
about
yours
sincerely
miles
lampson
on
this
subject
lord
avebury
had
stated
it
is
said
that
in
china
if
a
rich
man
is
condemned
to
death
he
can
sometimes
purchase
a
willing
substitute
at
a
very
small
in
regard
to
his
authority
for
this
statement
lord
avebury
wrote
to
me
august
i
believe
my
previous
information
came
from
sir
wade
but
i
have
been
unable
to
lay
my
hand
on
his
letter
and
do
not
therefore
like
to
state
it
as
a
sir
thomas
wade
was
english
ambassador
at
peking
and
afterwards
professor
of
chinese
at
cambridge
on
the
same
subject
valentine
chirol
editor
of
the
foreign
department
of
wrote
to
me
as
follows
queen
anne
s
mansions
westminster
dear
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
what
i
can
to
obtain
for
you
the
information
you
require
it
was
a
surprise
to
me
to
hear
that
the
accuracy
of
the
statement
was
called
in
question
it
is
certainly
a
matter
of
common
report
in
china
that
the
practice
exists
the
difficulty
i
conceive
will
be
to
obtain
evidence
enabling
one
to
quote
concrete
cases
my
own
impression
is
that
the
practice
is
quite
justifiable
according
to
chinese
ethics
when
life
is
given
up
from
motives
of
filial
piety
that
is
to
say
in
order
to
relieve
the
wants
of
indigent
parents
or
to
defray
the
costs
of
ancestral
rights
your
general
thesis
that
life
is
less
valued
and
more
readily
sacrificed
by
some
races
than
by
modern
europeans
seems
to
be
beyond
dispute
surely
the
japanese
practice
of
or
as
it
is
vulgarly
called
is
a
case
in
point
life
is
risked
as
in
duelling
by
europeans
for
the
mere
point
of
honour
but
it
is
never
deliberately
laid
down
in
satisfaction
of
the
exigencies
of
the
social
code
i
will
send
you
whatever
information
i
can
obtain
when
it
reaches
me
but
that
will
not
of
course
be
for
some
truly
valentine
chirol
friend
of
mine
who
has
just
been
here
entirely
confirms
my
own
belief
as
to
the
accuracy
of
your
statement
and
tells
me
he
has
himself
seen
several
imperial
decrees
in
the
calling
provincial
authorities
to
order
for
having
allowed
specific
cases
of
substitution
to
occur
and
ordering
the
death
penalty
to
be
carried
out
in
a
more
severe
form
on
the
original
culprits
as
an
extra
punishment
for
obtaining
substitutes
he
has
promised
to
look
up
some
of
these
impe
decrees
on
his
return
to
china
and
send
me
translations
i
am
satisfied
personally
that
his
statement
is
conclusive
on
the
same
subject
i
have
received
the
following
letter
from
bland

fourteen
years

the

dear

friend

chirol
writing
the
other
day
from
crete
on
his
way
east
asked
me
to
communicate
with
you
on
the
subject
of
your
letter
of
the
namely
the
custom
alleged
to
exist
in
china
of
procuring
substitutes
for
persons
condemned
to
death
the
substitutes
families
or
relatives
receiving
compensation
in
cash
to
speak
of
this
as
a
custom
is
to
exaggerate
the
frequency
of
a
class
of
incident
which
has
undoubtedly
been
recorded
in
china
and
of
which
there
has
been
mention
in
imperial
decrees
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
not
my
file
of
the
here
for
immediate
reference
but
i
am
writing
to
my
friend
backhouse
in
peking
and
have
no
doubt
but
that
he
will
be
able
to
give
chapter
and
verse
of
instances
thus
recorded
i
had
expected
to
find
cases
of
the
kind
recorded
in
werner
s
descriptive
sociology
of
the
chinese
spencerian
publications
but
have
not
been
able
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
an
index
to
that
voluminous
work
more
than
one
of
the
authors
whom
he
quotes
have
certainly
referred
to
cases
of
substitution
for
prisoners
parker
for
instance
china
past
and

asserts
that
substitutes
were
to
be
had
in

the
reasonable
price
of
fifty
taels

that
filial
piety
is
a
frequent
motive
the
negative
opinion
of
professors
giles
and
de
groot
is
entitled
to
consideration
but
can
not
be
regarded
as
any
more
conclusive
than
the
views
expressed
by
professor
giles
on
the
question
of
infanticide
which
are
outweighed
by
a
mass
of
direct
proof
of
in
a
country
where
men
submit
voluntarily
to
mutilation
and
grave
risk
of
death
for
a
comparatively
small
gain
to
themselves
and
their
relatives
where
women

in
hundreds
to
escape

alike
habitually

their
life
for
the
most
trivial
motives
of
revenge
or
distress
it
need
not
greatly
surprise
us
that
some
should
be
found
especially
among
the
wretchedly
poor
class
willing
to
give
up
their
life
in
order
to
relieve
their
families
of
want
or
otherwise
to
acquire
the
most
important
thing
i
think
in
expressing
any
opinion
about
the
chinese
is
to
remember
the
great
extent
and
heterogeneous
elements
of
the
country
and
to
abstain
from
any
sweeping
generalisations
based
on
isolated
acts
or
very
truly
bland
as
the
practice
in
question
involves
a
grave
miscarriage
of
justice
the
discovery
of
which
might
entail
serious
consequences
on
the
magistrate
who
connived
at
it
we
need
not
wonder
that
it
is
generally
hushed
up
and
that
no
instances
of
it
should
come
to
the
ears
of
many
europeans
resident
in
china
my
friend
professor
giles
of
cambridge
in
conversation
expressed
himself
quite
incredulous
on
the
subject
and
professor
de
groot
of
leyden
wrote
to
me
january
to
the
same
effect
the
rev
barber
headmaster
of
the
leys
school
cambridge
and
formerly
a
missionary
in
china
wrote
to
me
january
as
to
the
possibility
that
a
man
condemned
to
death
may
secure
a
substitute
on
payment
of
a
moderate
sum
of
money
we
used
to
hear
that
this
was
the
case
but
i
have
no
proof
that
would
justify
you
in
using
the
another
experienced
missionary
the
rev
cornaby
wrote
to
barber
i
have
heard
of
no
such
custom
in
capital
crimes
the
man
in
whose
house
a
fire
starts
may
and
often
does
pay
another
to
receive
the
blows
and
three
days
in
a
cangue
but
unless
where
foreign
riots
were
the
case
and
a
previously
condemned
criminal
handy
i
should
hardly
think
it
possible
every
precaution
is
taken
that
no
one
is
beheaded
but
the
man
who
can
not
possibly
be
let
off
the
expense
on
the
county
mandarin
is
over
in
stationery
expenses
with
higher
on
this
i
would
observe
that
if
every
execution
costs
the
local
mandarin
so
dear
he
must
be
under
a
strong
temptation
to
get
the
expenses
out
of
the
prisoner
whenever
he
can
do
so
without
being
detected
with
regard
to
the
custom
mentioned
by
cornaby
of
procuring
substitutes
for
corporal
punishment
we
are
told
that
in
china
there
are
men
who
earn
a
livelihood
by
being
thrashed
instead
of
the
real
culprits
but
they
bribe
the
executioner
to
lay
on
lightly
otherwise
their
constitution
could
not
long
resist
the
tear
and
wear
of
so
exhausting
a
profession
thus
the
theory
and
practice
of
vicarious
suffering
are
well
understood
in
china
note
b
swinging
as
a
magical
rite
the
custom
of
swinging
has
been
practised
as
a
religious
or
rather
magical
rite
in
various
parts
of
the
world
but
it
does
not
seem
possible
to
explain
all
the
instances
of
it
in
the
same
way
people
appear
to
have
resorted
to
the
practice
from
different
motives
and
with
different
ideas
of
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
it
in
the
text
we
have
seen
that
the
letts
and
perhaps
the
siamese
swing
to
make
the
crops
grow
tall
the
same
may
be
the
intention
of
the
ceremony
whenever
it
is
specially
observed
at
harvest
festivals
among
the
buginese
and
macassars
of
celebes
for
example
it
used
to
be
the
custom
for
young
girls
to
swing
one
after
the
other
on
these
occasions
at
the
great
dassera
festival
of
nepaul
which
immediately
precedes
the
cutting
of
the
rice
swings
and
kites
come
into
fashion
among
the
young
people
of
both
sexes
the
swings
are
sometimes
hung
from
boughs
of
trees
but
generally
from
a
supported
on
a
framework
of
tall
bamboos
among
the
dyaks
of
sarawak
a
feast
is
held
at
the
end
of
harvest
when
the
soul
of
the
rice
is
secured
to
prevent
the
crops
from
rotting
away
on
this
occasion
a
number
of
old
women
rock
to
and
fro
on
a
rude
swing
suspended
from
the
rafters
a
traveller
in
sarawak
has
described
how
he
saw
many
tall
swings
erected
and
dyaks
swinging
to
and
fro
on
them
sometimes
ten
or
twelve
men
together
on
one
swing
while
they
chanted
in
monotonous
tones
an
invocation
to
the
spirits
that
they
would
be
pleased
to
grant
a
plentiful
harvest
of
sago
and
fruit
and
a
good
fishing
season
in
the
east
indian
island
of
bengkali
elaborate
and
costly
ceremonies
are
performed
to
ensure
a
good
catch
of
fish
among
the
rest
an
hereditary
priestess
who
bears
the
royal
title
of
djindjang
rajah
works
herself
up
by
means
of
the
fumes
of
incense
and
so
forth
into
that
state
of
mental
disorder
which
with
many
people
passes
for
a
symptom
of
divine
inspiration
in
this
pious
frame
of
mind
she
is
led
by
her
four
handmaids
to
a
swing
all
covered
with
yellow
and
hung
with
golden
bells
on
which
she
takes
her
seat
amid
the
jingle
of
the
bells
as
she
rocks
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
swing
she
speaks
in
an
unknown
tongue
to
each
of
the
sixteen
spirits
who
have
to
do
with
the
fishing
in
order
to
procure
a
plentiful
supply
of
game
the
tinneh
indians
of
america
perform
a
magical
ceremony
which
they
call
the
young
man
bounding
or
they
pinion
a
man
tightly
and
having
hung
him
by
the
head
and
heels
from
the
roof
of
the
hut
rock
him
backwards
and
forwards
thus
we
see
that
people
swing
in
order
to
procure
a
plentiful
supply
of
fish
and
game
as
well
as
good
crops
in
such
cases
the
notion
seems
to
be
that
the
ceremony
promotes
fertility
whether
in
the
vegetable
or
the
animal
kingdom
though
why
it
should
be
supposed
to
do
so
i
confess
myself
unable
to
explain
there
seem
to
be
some
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
indian
rite
of
swinging
on
hooks
run
through
the
flesh
of
the
performer
is
also
resorted
to
at
least
in
some
cases
from
a
belief
in
its
fertilising
virtue
thus
hamilton
tells
us
that
at
karwar
on
the
west
coast
of
india
a
feast
is
held
at
the
end
of
may
or
beginning
of
june
in
honour
of
the
infernal
gods
with
a
divination
or
conjuration
to
know
the
fate
of
the
ensuing
crop
of
men
were
hung
from
a
pole
by
means
of
inserted
in
the
flesh
of
their
backs
and
the
pole
with
the
men
dangling
from
it
was
then
dragged
for
more
than
a
mile
over
ploughed
ground
from
one
sacred
grove
to
another
preceded
by
a
young
girl
who
carried
a
pot
of
fire
on
her
head
when
the
second
grove
was
reached
the
men
were
let
down
and
taken
off
the
hooks
and
the
girl
fell
into
the
usual
prophetic
frenzy
after
which
she
unfolded
to
the
priests
the
revelation
with
which
she
had
just
been
favoured
by
the
terrestrial
gods
in
each
of
the
groves
a
shapeless
black
stone
daubed
with
red
lead
to
stand
for
a
mouth
eyes
and
ears
appears
to
have
represented
the
indwelling
divinity
sometimes
this
custom
of
swinging
on
hooks
which
is
known
among
the
hindoos
as
seems
to
be
intended
to
propitiate
demons
some
santals
asked
ball
to
be
allowed
to
perform
it
because
their
women
and
children
were
dying
of
sickness
and
their
cattle
were
being
killed
by
wild
beasts
they
believed
that
these
misfortunes
befell
them
because
the
evil
spirits
had
not
been
appeased
these
same
santals
celebrate
a
swinging
festival
of
a
less
barbarous
sort
about
the
month
of
february
eight
men
sit
in
chairs
and
rotate
round
posts
in
a
sort
of
revolving
swing
like
the
which
are
so
dear
to
children
at
english
fairs
at
the
nauroz
and
eed
festivals
in
dardistan
the
women
swing
on
ropes
suspended
from
trees
during
the
rainy
season
in
behar
young
women
swing
in
their
houses
while
they
sing
songs
appropriate
to
the
season
the
period
during
which
they
indulge
in
this
pastime
if
a
mere
pastime
it
be
is
strictly
limited
it
begins
with
a
festival
which
usually
falls
on
the
of
the
month
jeyt
and
ends
with
another
festival
which
commonly
takes
place
on
the
of
the
month
asin
no
one
would
think
of
swinging
at
any
other
time
of
the
year
it
is
possible
that
this
last
custom
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
pastime
meant
to
while
away
some
of
the
tedious
hours
of
the
inclement
season
but
its
limitation
to
a
certain
portion
of
the
year
seems
rather
to
point
to
a
religious
or
magical
origin
possibly
the
intention
may
once
have
been
to
drive
away
the
rain
we
shall
see
immediately
that
swinging
is
sometimes
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
the
powers
of
evil
about
the
middle
of
march
the
hindoos
observe
a
swinging
festival
of
a
different
sort
in
honour
of
the
god
krishna
whose
image
is
placed
in
the
seat
or
cradle
of
a
swing
and
then
just
when
the
dawn
is
breaking
rocked
gently
to
and
fro
several
times
the
same
ceremony
is
repeated
at
noon
and
at
sunset
in
the
rigveda
the
sun
is
called
by
a
natural
metaphor
the
golden
swing
in
the
sky
and
the
expression
helps
us
to
understand
a
ceremony
of
vedic
india
a
priest
sat
in
a
swing
and
touched
with
the
span
of
his
right
hand
at
once
the
seat
of
the
swing
and
the
ground
in
doing
so
he
said
the
great
lord
has
united
himself
with
the
great
lady
the
god
has
united
himself
with
the
perhaps
he
meant
to
indicate
in
a
graphic
way
that
the
sun
had
reached
that
lowest
point
of
its
course
where
it
was
nearest
to
the
earth
in
this
connexion
it
is
of
interest
to
note
that
in
the
esthonian
celebration
of
john
s
day
or
the
summer
solstice
swings
play
along
with
bonfires
the
most
prominent
part
girls
sit
and
swing
the
whole
night
through
singing
old
songs
to
explain
why
they
do
so
for
legend
tells
of
an
esthonian
prince
who
wooed
and
won
an
islandic
princess
but
a
wicked
enchanter
spirited
away
the
lover
to
a
desert
island
where
he
languished
in
captivity
till
his
contrived
to
break
the
magic
spell
that
bound
him
together
they
sailed
home
to
esthonia
which
they
reached
on
john
s
day
and
burnt
their
ship
resolved
to
stray
no
longer
in
far
foreign
lands
the
swings
in
which
the
esthonian
maidens
still
rock
themselves
on
john
s
day
are
said
to
recall
the
ship
in
which
the
lovers
tossed
upon
the
stormy
sea
and
the
bonfires
commemorate
the
burning
of
it
when
the
fires
have
died
out
the
swings
are
laid
aside
and
never
used
again
either
in
the
village
or
at
the
solitary
alehouse
until
spring
comes
round
once
more
here
it
is
natural
to
connect
both
swings
and
bonfires
with
the
apparent
course
of
the
sun
who
reaches
the
highest
and
turning
point
of
his
orbit
on
john
s
day
bonfires
and
swings
perhaps
were
originally
charms
intended
to
kindle
and
speed
afresh
on
its
heavenly
road
the
golden
swing
in
the
among
the
letts
of
south
livonia
and
curland
the
summer
solstice
is
the
occasion
of
a
great
festival
of
flowers
at
which
the
people
sing
songs
with
the
constant
refrain
of
it
has
been
proposed
to
derive
the
word
from
the
lettish
verb
to
swing
with
reference
to
the
sun
swinging
in
the
sky
at
this
of
his
course
at
tengaroeng
in
eastern
borneo
the
priests
and
priestesses
receive
the
inspiration
of
the
spirits
seated
in
swings
and
rocking
themselves
to
and
fro
thus
suspended
in
the
air
they
appear
to
be
in
a
peculiarly
favourable
position
for
catching
the
divine
afflatus

of

plank
which
forms

seat
of
the
priest

swing

carved
in
the
rude
likeness
of
a
crocodile

head
the

of
the

similarly
ornamented
with
a
serpent

head
again
swings
are
used
for
the
cure
of
sickness
but
it
is
the
doctor
who
rocks
himself
in
them
not
the
patient
in
north
borneo
the
dyak
medicine
man
will
sometimes
erect
a
swing
in
front
of
the
sick
man
s
house
and
sway
backwards
and
forwards
on
it
for
the
purpose
of
kicking
away
the
disease
frightening
away
evil
spirits
and
catching
the
stray
soul
of
the
sufferer
clearly
in
his
passage
through
the
air
the
physician
is
likely
to
collide
with
the
disease
and
the
evil
spirits
both
of
which
are
sure
to
be
loitering
about
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
patient
and
the
rude
shock
thus
given
to
the
malady
and
the
demons
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
push
or
hustle
them
away
at
tengaroeng
in
eastern
borneo
a
traveller
witnessed
a
ceremony
for
the
expulsion
of
an
evil
spirit
in
which
swinging
played
a
part
after
four
men
in
blue
shirts
bespangled
with
stars
and
wearing
coronets
of
red
cloth
decorated
with
beads
and
bells
had
sought
diligently
for
the
devil
grabbling
about
on
the
floor
and
grunting
withal
three
hideous
hags
dressed
in
faded
red
petticoats
were
brought
in
with
great
pomp
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
malays
and
took
their
seats
amid
solemn
silence
on
the
cradle
of
a
swing
the
ends
of
which
were
carved
to
represent
the
head
and
tail
of
a
crocodile
not
a
sound
escaped
from
the
crowd
of
spectators
during
this
ceremony
they
regarded
the
business
as
most
serious
the
venerable
dames
then
rocked
to
and
fro
on
the
swing
fanning
themselves
languidly
with
chinese
paper
fans
at
a
later
stage
of
the
performance
they
and
three
girls
discharged
burning
arrows
at
a
sort
of
altar
of
banana
leaves
maize
and
grass
this
completed
the
discomfiture
of
the
devil
the
athenians
in
antiquity
celebrated
an
annual
festival
of
swinging
boards
were
hung
from
trees
by
ropes
and
people
sitting
on
them
swung
to
and
fro
while
they
sang
songs
of
a
loose
or
voluptuous
character
the
swinging
went
on
both
in
public
and
private
various
explanations
were
given
of
the
custom
the
most
generally
received
was
as
follows
when
bacchus
came
among
men
to
make
known
to
them
the
pleasures
of
wine
he
lodged
with
a
certain
icarus
or
icarius
to
whom
he
revealed
the
precious
secret
and
bade
him
go
forth
and
carry
the
glad
tidings
to
all
the
world
so
icarus
loaded
a
waggon
with
and
set
out
on
his
travels
the
dog
maera
running
beside
him
he
came
to
attica
and
there
fell
in
with
shepherds
tending
their
sheep
to
whom
he
gave
of
the
wine
they
drank
greedily
but
when
some
of
them
fell
down
dead
drunk
their
companions
thought
the
stranger
had
poisoned
them
with
intent
to
steal
the
sheep
so
they
knocked
him
on
the
head
the
faithful
dog
ran
home
and
guided
his
master
s
daughter
erigone
to
the
body
at
sight
of
it
she
was
smitten
with
despair
and
hanged
herself
on
a
tree
beside
her
dead
father
but
not
until
she
had
prayed
that
unless
the
athenians
should
avenge
her
sire
s
murder
their
daughters
might
die
the
same
death
as
she
her
curse
was
fulfilled
for
soon
many
athenian
damsels
hanged
themselves
for
no
obvious
reason
an
oracle
informed
the
athenians
of
the
true
cause
of
this
epidemic
of
suicide
so
they
sought
out
the
bodies
of
the
unhappy
pair
and
instituted
the
swinging
festival
to
appease
erigone
and
at
the
vintage
they
offered
the
first
of
the
grapes
to
her
and
her
father
thus
the
swinging
festival
at
athens
was
regarded
by
the
ancients
as
an
expiation
for
a
suicide
or
suicides
by
hanging
this
opinion
is
strongly
confirmed
by
a
statement
of
varro
that
it
was
unlawful
to
perform
funeral
rites
in
honour
of
persons
who
had
died
by
hanging
but
that
in
their
case
such
rites
were
replaced
by
a
custom
of
swinging
images
as
if
in
imitation
of
the
death
they
had
died
servius
says
that
the
athenians
failing
to
find
the
bodies
of
icarius
and
erigone
on
earth
made
a
pretence
of
seeking
them
in
the
air
by
swinging
on
ropes
hung
from
trees
and
he
seems
to
have
regarded
the
custom
of
swinging
as
a
purification
by
means
of
air
this
explanation
probably
comes
very
near
the
truth
indeed
if
we
substitute
souls
for
bodies
in
the
wording
of
it
we
may
almost
accept
it
as
exact
it
might
be
thought
that
the
souls
of
persons
who
had
died
by
hanging
were
more
than
the
souls
of
the
other
dead
hovering
in
the
air
since
their
bodies
were
suspended
in
air
at
the
moment
of
death
hence
it
would
be
considered
needful
to
purge
the
air
of
these
vagrant
spirits
and
this
might
be
done
by
swinging
persons
or
things
to
and
fro
in
order
that
by
their
impact
they
might
disperse
and
drive
away
the
baleful
ghosts
thus
the
custom
would
be
exactly
analogous
on
the
one
hand
to
the
practice
of
the
malay
who
swings
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
patient
s
house
in
order
to
chase
away
the
disease
or
to
frighten
away
evil
spirits
or
to
catch
the
stray
soul
of
the
sick
man
and
on
the
other
hand
to
the
practice
of
the
central
australian
aborigines
who
beat
the
air
with
their
weapons
and
hands
in
order
to
drive
the
lingering
ghost
away
to
the
grave
at
rome
swinging
seems
to
have
formed
part
of
the
great
latin
festival
and
its
origin
was
traced
to
a
search
in
the
air
for
the
body
or
even
the
soul
of
king
latinus
who
had
disappeared
from
earth
after
the
battle
with
mezentius
king
of
caere
yet
on
the
other
hand
there
are
circumstances
which
point
to
an
intimate
association
both
at
athens
and
rome
of
these
swinging
festivals
with
an
intention
of
promoting
the
growth
of
cultivated
plants
such
circumstances
are
the
legendary
connexion
of
the
athenian
festival
with
bacchus
the
custom
of
offering
the
of
the
vintage
to
erigone
and
icarius
and
at
rome
the
practice
of
hanging
masks
on
trees
at
the
time
of
sowing
and
in
order
to
make
the
grapes
grow
better
perhaps
we
can
reconcile
the
two
apparently
discrepant
effects
attributed
to
swinging
as
a
means
of
expiation
on
the
one
side
and
of
fertilisation
on
the
other
by
supposing
that
in
both
cases
the
intention
is
to
clear
the
air
of
dangerous
influences
whether
these
are
ghosts
of
the
unburied
dead
or
spiritual
powers
inimical
to
the
growth
of
plants
independent
of
both
appears
to
be
the
notion
that
the
higher
you
swing
the
higher
will
grow
the
crops
this
last
is
homoeopathic
or
imitative
magic
pure
and
simple
without
any
admixture
of
the
ideas
of
purification
or
expiation
in
modern
greece
and
italy
the
custom
of
swinging
as
a
festal
rite
whatever
its
origin
may
be
is
still
observed
in
some
places
at
the
small
village
of
koukoura
in
elis
an
english
traveller
observed
peasants
swinging
from
a
tree
in
honour
of
george
whose
festival
it
was
on
the
tuesday
after
easter
the
maidens
of
seriphos
play
their
favourite
game
of
the
swing
they
hang
a
rope
from
one
wall
to
another
of
the
steep
narrow
filthy
street
and
putting
some
clothes
on
it
swing
one
after
the
other
singing
as
they
swing
young
men
who
try
to
pass
are
called
upon
to
pay
toll
in
the
shape
of
a
penny
a
song
and
a
swing
the
words
which
the
youth
sings
are
generally
these
the
gold
is
swung
the
silver
is
swung
and
swung
too
is
my
love
with
the
golden
hair
to
which
the
girl
replies
who
is
it
that
swings
me
that
i
may
gild
him
with
my
favour
that
i
may
work
him
a
fez
all
covered
with
pearls
in
the
greek
island
of
karpathos
the
villagers
assemble
at
a
given
place
on
each
of
the
four
sundays
before
easter
a
swing
is
erected
and
the
women
swing
one
after
the
other
singing
death
wails
such
as
they
chant
round
the
mimic
tombs
in
church
on
the
night
of
good
friday
on
christmas
day
peasant
girls
in
some
villages
of
calabria
fasten
ropes
to
iron
rings
in
the
ceiling
and
swing
on
them
while
they
sing
certain
songs
prescribed
by
custom
for
the
occasion
the
practice
is
regarded
not
merely
as
an
amusement
but
also
as
an
act
of
devotion
it
is
a
custom
in
cadiz
when
christmas
comes
to
fasten
swings
in
the
courtyards
of
houses
and
even
in
the
houses
themselves
when
there
is
no
room
for
them
outside
in
the
evenings
lads
and
lasses
assemble
round
the
swings
and
pass
the
time
happily
in
swinging
amid
joyous
songs
and
cries
the
swings
are
taken
down
when
carnival
is
the
observance
of
the
custom
at
christmas
that
is
at
the
winter
solstice
suggests
that
in
calabria
and
spain
as
in
esthonia
the
pastime
may
originally
have
been
a
magical
rite
designed
to
assist
the
sun
in
climbing
the
steep
ascent
to
the
top
of
the
summer
sky
if
this
were
so
we
might
surmise
that
the
gold
and
the
golden
hair
mentioned
by
youths
and
maidens
of
seriphos
as
they
swing
refer
to
the
golden
swing
in
the
sky
in
other
words
to
the
sun
whose
golden
lamp
swings
daily
across
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
however
that
may
be
it
would
seem
that
festivals
of
swinging
are
especially
held
in
spring
this
is
true
for
example
of
north
africa
where
such
festivals
are
common
at
some
places
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
date
of
the
swinging
is
the
time
of
the
apricots
at
others
it
is
said
to
be
the
spring
equinox
in
some
places
the
festival
lasts
three
days
and
fathers
who
have
had
children
born
to
them
within
the
year
bring
them
and
swing
them
in
the
swings
in
corea
the
fifth
day
of
the
fifth
moon
is
called
ancestors
are
then
worshipped
and
swings
are
put
up
in
the
yards
of
most
houses
for
the
amusement
of
the
people
the
women
on
this
day
may
go
about
the
streets
during
the
rest
of
the
year
they
may
go
out
only
after
dark
dressed
in
their
prettiest
clothes
they
visit
the
various
houses
and
amuse
themselves
swinging
the
swing
is
said
to
convey
the
idea
of
keeping
cool
in
the
approaching
summer
it
is
one
of
the
most
popular
feasts
of
the
perhaps
the
reason
here
assigned
for
swinging
may
explain
other
instances
of
the
custom
on
the
principles
of
homoeopathic
magic
the
swinging
may
be
regarded
as
a
means
of
ensuring
a
succession
of
cool
refreshing
breezes
during
the
oppressive
heat
of
the
ensuing
summer

that
every
god
must
die
after
he
had
begotten
a
son
in

likeness
wiedemann

hence
the
egyptian
deities
were
commonly
arranged
in
trinities
of
a
simple
and
natural
type
each
comprising
a
father
a
mother
and
a
son
speaking
generally
two
members
of
such
a
triad
were
gods
one
old
and
one
young
and
the
third
was
a
goddess
who
was
naturally
the
wife
or
female
counterpart
of
the
older
god
the
younger
god
was
the
son
of
the

goddess

he
was
supposed
to
possess
all
the
attributes

powers
which
belonged

his

the
feminine
counterpart
or
wife
of
the
chief
god
was
usually
a
local
goddess
of
little
or
no
importance
on
the
other
hand
her
son
by
the
chief
god
was
nearly
as
important
as
his
father
because
it
was
assumed
that
he
would
succeed
to
his
rank
and
throne
when
the
elder
god
had
passed
away
the
conception
of
the
triad
or
trinity
is
in
egypt
probably
as
old
as
the
belief
in
gods
and
it
seems
to
be
based
on
the
anthropomorphic
views
which
were
current

constantly
defines
god
as
a

that
the
speculations
of
this
alexandrian
jew
deeply
influenced
the
course
of

thought
on
the
mystical
nature
of
the
deity
thus
it
seems
not
impossible
that
the
ancient
egyptian
doctrine
of
the
divine
trinity
may
have
been
distilled
through
philo
into

mistook

on

to
furnish

the

s

his

which
is
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
a

entity
temporarily
seated
in

ruling
sovereign

separable
from

transferable
to
another
see

article

there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
in

of
westermarck
s
theory
which
is
supported
in
particular
by
the
sanctity
attributed
to
the
regalia
but
on
the
whole
i
see
no
sufficient
reason
to
abandon
the
view
adopted
in
the
text
and
i
am
confirmed
in
it
by
the
shilluk
evidence
which
was
unknown
to
westermarck
when
he
propounded
his
theory
the
single
combat
of
the

of

at

probably
a

take

arrange
themselves

that
those
born
during

those
born
in

winter
stand
inland

then
they
pull

whether
summer

is
the
stronger

should
