well
al
just
as
this
was
coming
off
her
old
man
come
at
me
the
real
dope
by
ring
lardner
author
of
gullible
travels
my
four
weeks
in
france
treat
rough
etc
illustrated
by
may

preston
and
blumenthal
chapter
i
and
many
a
stormy
wind
shall
blow
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
i
suppose
it
is
kind
of
foolish
to
be
writeing
you
a
letter
now
when
they
wo
be
no
chance
to
mail
it
till
we
get
across
the
old
pond
but
still
and
all
a
man
has
got
to
do
something
to
keep
themself
busy
and
i
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
all
about
our
trip
so
i
might
as
well
write
you
a
letter
when
ever
i
get
a
chance
and
i
can
mail
them
to
you
all
at
once
when
we
get
across
the
old
pond
and
you
will
think
i
have
wrote
a
book
or
something
jokeing
a
side
al
you
are
lucky
to
have
an
old
pal
thats
going
to
see
all
the
fun
and
write
to
you
about
it
because
its
a
different
thing
haveing
a
person
write
to
you
about
what
they
see
themself
then
getting
the
dope
out
of
a
newspaper
or
something
because
you
will
know
that
what
i
tell
you
is
the
real
dope
that
i
seen
myself
where
if
you
read
it
in
a
newspaper
you
know
its
guest
work
because
in
the
place
they
do
leave
the
reporters
get
nowheres
near
the
front
and
besides
that
they
would
go
there
if
they
had
a
leave
because
they
would
be
to
scared
like
the
baseball
reporters
that
sets
a
mile
from
the
game
because
they
have
got
the
nerve
to
get
down
on
the
field
where
a
man
could
take
a
punch
at
them
and
even
when
they
are
a
mile
away
with
a
screen
in
front
of
them
they
duck
when
somebody
hits
a
pop
foul
well
al
it
is
against
the
rules
to
tell
you
when
we
left
the
old
or
where
we
come
away
from
because
the
pro
german
spy
might
get
a
hold
of
a
man
letter
some
way
and
then
it
would
be
good
night
because
he
would
send
a
telegram
to
where
the
submarines
is
located
at
and
they
would
send
no
or
submarines
after
us
but
the
whole
german
navy
would
get
after
us
because
they
would
figure
that
if
they
ever
got
us
it
would
be
a
rich
hall
when
i
say
that
al
i
do
mean
it
to
sound
like
i
was
swell
headed
or
something
and
i
do
mean
it
would
be
a
rich
hall
because
i
am
on
board
or
nothing
like
that
but
you
would
know
what
i
am
getting
at
if
you
seen
the
bunch
we
are
takeing
across
in
the
place
al
this
is
a
different
kind
of
a
trip
then
the
time
i
went
around
the
world
with
the
ball
clubs
because
then
it
was
just
the
boat
load
and
only
for
two
or
of
the
boys
on
board
it
would
of
made
no
difference
if
the
boat
had
of
turned
a
turtle
only
to
pave
the
whole
bottom
of
the
ocean
with
ivory
but
this
time
al
we
have
got
not
only
boat
load
but
we
got
four
boat
loads
of
soldiers
alone
and
that
is
not
all
we
have
got
all
together
al
there
is
boats
in
the
parade
and
of
them
is
what
they
call
the
convoys
and
that
means
war
ships
that
goes
along
to
see
that
we
get
there
safe
on
acct
of
the
submarines
and
four
of
them
is
what
they
call
destroyers
and
they
are
little
bits
of
shafers
but
they
say
they
can
go
like
he
ll
when
they
get
started
and
when
a
submarine
pops
up
these
little
birds
chases
right
after
them
and
drops
a
death
bomb
on
to
them
and
if
it
ever
hits
them
the
capt
of
the
submarine
can
pick
up
what
is
left
of
his
boat
and
stick
a
cent
stamp
on
it
and
mail
it
to
the
kaiser
jokeing
a
side
i
guess
they
no
chance
of
a
submarine
getting
fat
off
of
us
as
long
as
these
little
birds
is
on
watch
so
i
do
see
why
a
man
should
come
right
out
and
say
when
we
left
and
from
where
we
come
from
but
if
they
did
have
some
kind
of
rules
they
a
lot
of
guys
that
would
know
no
better
then
write
to
van
hinburg
or
somebody
and
tell
them
all
they
know
but
i
guess
at
that
they
could
use
a
post
card
well
al
we
been
at
sea
just
two
days
and
a
lot
of
the
boys
has
gave
up
the
ghost
all
ready
and
pretty
near
everything
else
but
i
have
felt
the
least
bit
sick
that
is
sea
sick
but
i
will
own
up
i
felt
a
little
home
sick
just
as
we
come
out
of
the
harbor
and
seen
the
godess
of
liberty
standing
up
there
maybe
for
the
last
time
but
do
think
for
a
minute
al
that
i
am
sorry
i
come
and
i
only
wish
we
was
over
there
all
ready
and
could
get
in
to
it
and
the
only
kick
i
got
comeing
so
far
is
that
we
have
got
no
further
then
we
are
now
on
acct
that
we
did
do
nothing
the
day
only
stall
around
like
we
was
waiting
for
connie
mack
to
waggle
his
score
card
or
something
but
we
will
get
there
some
time
and
when
we
do
you
can
bet
we
will
show
them
something
and
i
am
tickled
to
death
i
am
going
and
if
i
lay
down
my
life
i
will
feel
like
it
was
throwed
away
for
nothing
like
you
would
die
of
tyford
fever
or
something
well
i
would
of
liked
to
of
had
florrie
and
little
al
come
east
and
see
me
off
but
florrie
felt
like
she
could
afford
to
spend
the
money
to
make
another
long
trip
after
making
one
long
trip
down
to
texas
and
besides
we
was
even
supposed
to
tell
our
family
where
we
was
going
to
sail
from
but
i
notice
they
was
a
lot
of
women
folks
right
down
to
the
dock
to
bid
us
good
by
and
i
suppose
they
just
guessed
what
was
comeing
off
eh
al
or
maybe
they
was
all
strangers
that
just
happened
to
be
there
but
i
say
i
never
seen
so
much
kissing
between
strangers
any
way
i
and
my
family
had
our
farewells
out
west
and
florrie
was
got
up
like
a
fancy
dress
ball
and
i
suppose
if
i
die
where
she
can
tend
the
funeral
she
will
come
in
pink
tights
or
something
well
al
i
better
not
keep
on
talking
about
florrie
and
little
al
or
i
will
do
the
baby
act
and
any
way
its
pretty
near
time
for
chow
but
i
suppose
you
will
wonder
what
am
i
talking
about
when
i
say
chow
well
al
that
the
name
we
boys
got
up
down
to
camp
grant
for
stuff
to
eat
and
when
we
talk
about
food
instead
of
saying
food
we
say
chow
so
that
what
i
am
getting
at
when
i
say
its
pretty
near
time
for
chow
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
here
we
are
out
somewheres
in
the
middle
of
the
old
pond
and
i
wished
the
trip
was
over
not
because
i
have
been
sea
sick
or
anything
but
i
ca
hardly
wait
to
get
over
there
and
get
in
to
it
and
besides
they
got
us
jammed
in
like
a
sardine
or
something
and
four
of
us
in
state
room
and
i
do
mind
doubleing
up
with
some
good
pal
but
a
man
ca
get
no
rest
when
they
four
trying
to
sleep
in
a
room
that
would
be
big
enough
for
nemo
liebold
but
i
would
make
no
holler
at
that
if
they
had
of
left
us
pick
our
own
roomys
but
out
of
the
four
of
us
they
one
that
looks
like
he
must
of
bribed
the
jury
or
he
would
be
here
and
his
name
is
smith
and
another
one
name
is
sam
hall
and
he
has
always
got
a
grouch
on
and
the
other
boy
is
only
i
would
like
him
a
whole
lot
better
if
he
was
about
his
size
but
no
he
is
as
big
as
me
only
not
put
up
like
i
am
his
name
is
lee
and
he
pulls
a
lot
of
funny
stuff
like
this
he
says
they
must
of
thought
us
four
was
a
male
quartette
and
they
stuck
us
all
in
together
so
as
we
could
get
some
close
harmony
that
what
they
call
it
when
they
hit
them
minors
well
al
i
always
been
use
to
sleeping
with
my
feet
in
bed
with
me
but
you
ca
do
that
in
the
bunk
i
have
got
because
your
knee
would
crack
you
in
the
jaw
and
knock
you
out
and
even
if
they
was
room
to
strech
hall
keeps
crabbing
till
you
ca
rest
and
he
keeps
the
room
filled
up
with
cigarette
smoke
and
no
air
and
you
ca
open
up
the
port
hole
or
you
would
freeze
to
death
so
about
the
only
chance
i
get
to
sleep
is
up
in
the
parlor
in
a
chair
in
the
day
time
and
you
do
no
sooner
set
down
when
they
got
a
life
boat
drill
or
something
and
for
some
reason
another
they
have
a
role
call
every
day
and
that
means
everybody
has
got
to
answer
to
their
name
to
see
if
we
are
all
on
board
just
as
if
they
was
any
other
place
to
go
when
they
give
the
signal
for
a
life
boat
drill
everybody
has
got
to
stick
their
life
belt
on
and
go
to
the
boat
where
they
have
been
given
the
number
of
it
and
even
when
everybody
knows
its
a
fake
you
got
to
show
up
just
the
same
and
yesterday
they
was
one
bird
thats
supposed
to
go
in
our
life
boat
and
he
was
sea
sick
and
he
did
show
up
so
they
went
after
him
and
one
of
the
officers
told
him
that
was
no
excuse
and
what
would
he
do
if
he
was
sea
sick
and
the
ship
was
realy
sinking
and
he
says
he
thought
it
was
realy
sinking
ever
since
we
started
well
al
we
got
some
crowd
on
the
boat
and
they
two
french
officers
along
with
us
that
been
giveing
drills
and
etc
in
one
of
the
camps
in
the
and
navy
officers
and
gunners
and
a
man
would
almost
wish
something
would
happen
because
i
bet
we
would
put
up
some
battle
lee
just
come
in
and
asked
me
who
was
i
writeing
to
and
i
told
him
and
he
says
i
better
be
careful
to
not
write
nothing
against
anybody
on
the
trip
just
as
if
i
would
but
any
way
i
asked
him
why
not
and
he
says
because
all
the
mail
would
be
opened
and
read
by
the
censor
so
i
said
yes
but
he
see
this
because
i
wo
mail
it
till
we
get
across
the
old
pond
and
then
i
will
mail
all
my
letters
at
once
so
he
said
a
man
ca
do
it
that
way
because
just
before
we
hit
land
the
censor
will
take
all
our
mail
off
of
us
and
read
it
and
cut
out
whatever
he
do
like
and
then
mail
it
himself
so
i
did
know
we
had
a
censor
along
with
us
but
lee
says
we
certainly
have
got
one
and
he
is
up
in
the
front
ship
and
they
call
that
the
censor
ship
on
acct
of
him
being
on
there
well
al
i
do
care
what
he
reads
and
what
he
do
read
because
i
am
not
the
kind
that
spill
anything
about
the
trip
that
would
hurt
anybody
or
get
them
in
bad
so
he
is
welcome
to
read
anything
i
write
you
might
say
this
front
ship
is
the
slowest
one
of
the
whole
four
and
how
is
that
for
fine
judgment
al
to
put
the
slowest
one
ahead
and
this
ship
we
are
on
is
the
fastest
and
they
keep
us
behind
instead
of
leaving
us
go
up
ahead
and
set
the
pace
for
them
and
no
wonder
we
never
get
nowheres
of
course
that
ai
the
censor
fault
but
if
the
old
is
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
men
across
the
pond
i
should
think
they
would
use
some
judgment
and
its
just
like
as
if
hughey
jennings
would
stick
oscar
stanage
or
somebody
ahead
of
cobb
in
the
batting
order
so
as
cobb
could
make
to
many
bases
on
a
hit
well
al
i
will
have
to
cut
it
out
for
now
because
its
pretty
near
time
for
chow
and
that
the
name
we
got
up
out
to
camp
grant
for
meals
and
now
everybody
in
the
army
when
they
talk
about
food
they
call
it
chow
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
they
have
got
a
new
nickname
for
me
and
now
they
call
me
jack
tar
and
bob
lee
got
it
up
and
i
will
tell
you
how
it
come
off
last
night
was
one
rough
bird
and
i
guess
pretty
near
everybody
on
the
boat
were
sick
and
lee
says
to
me
how
was
it
that
i
stood
the
rough
weather
so
good
and
it
did
seem
to
effect
me
so
i
says
it
was
probably
on
acct
of
me
going
around
the
world
that
time
with
the
two
ball
clubs
and
i
was
right
at
home
on
the
water
so
he
says
i
guess
we
better
call
you
jack
tar
so
that
how
they
come
to
call
me
jack
tar
and
its
a
name
they
got
for
old
sailors
that
been
all
their
life
on
the
water
so
on
acct
of
my
name
being
jack
it
fits
in
pretty
good
well
a
man
ca
help
from
feeling
sorry
for
the
boys
that
have
not
been
across
the
old
pond
before
and
ca
stand
a
little
rough
spell
but
it
makes
a
man
kind
of
proud
to
think
the
rough
weather
do
effect
you
when
pretty
near
everybody
else
feels
like
a
churn
or
something
the
minute
a
drop
of
water
splashes
the
side
of
the
boat
but
still
a
man
hardly
help
from
laughing
when
they
look
at
them
lee
says
he
would
of
thought
i
would
of
enlisted
in
the
navy
on
acct
of
being
such
a
good
sailor
well
i
would
of
al
if
i
had
knew
they
needed
men
and
i
told
lee
so
and
he
said
he
thought
the
made
a
big
mistake
keeping
it
a
secret
that
they
did
need
men
in
the
navy
till
all
the
good
ones
enlisted
in
the
draft
and
then
of
course
the
navy
had
to
take
what
they
could
get
well
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
that
one
of
the
boys
in
our
room
is
named
freddie
smith
and
he
do
never
say
a
word
and
i
thought
at
it
was
because
he
was
a
kind
of
a
bum
like
hall
that
did
know
nothing
and
that
why
he
did
say
it
but
it
seems
the
reason
he
do
talk
more
is
because
he
ca
talk
english
very
good
but
he
is
a
frenchman
and
he
was
a
waiter
in
the
big
french
resturent
in
milwaukee
and
now
what
do
you
think
al
he
is
going
to
learn
lee
and
i
french
lessons
and
lee
fixed
it
up
with
him
we
want
to
learn
how
to
talk
a
little
so
when
we
get
there
we
can
make
ourself
understood
and
you
remember
i
started
studing
french
out
to
camp
grant
but
the
man
down
there
did
know
nothing
about
what
he
was
talking
about
so
i
walked
out
on
him
but
this
bird
wo
try
and
learn
us
grammer
or
how
you
spell
it
or
nothing
like
that
but
just
a
few
words
so
as
we
can
order
drinks
and
meals
and
etc
when
we
get
a
leave
off
some
time
tonight
we
are
going
to
have
our
lesson
and
with
a
man
like
he
to
learn
us
we
ought
to
pick
it
up
quick
well
old
pal
i
will
wind
up
for
this
time
as
i
do
feel
very
good
on
acct
of
something
i
eat
this
noon
and
its
a
wonder
a
man
can
keep
up
at
all
where
they
got
you
in
a
stateroom
jammed
in
like
a
sardine
or
something
and
hall
smokeing
all
the
while
like
he
was
a
freight
engine
pulling
a
freight
train
up
grade
or
something
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
just
a
line
al
because
i
do
feel
like
writeing
as
i
was
taken
sick
last
night
from
something
i
eat
and
who
would
be
sick
jammed
in
a
room
like
a
sardine
i
had
a
kind
of
a
run
in
with
hall
because
he
tried
to
kid
me
about
being
sick
with
some
of
his
funny
stuff
but
i
told
him
where
to
head
in
he
started
out
by
saying
to
lee
that
jack
tar
looked
like
somebody
had
knocked
the
tar
out
of
him
and
after
a
while
he
says
what
the
matter
with
the
old
salt
tonight
he
do
seem
to
have
no
pepper
with
him
so
i
told
him
to
shut
up
well
we
did
have
no
french
lesson
on
acct
of
me
being
taken
sick
but
we
are
going
to
have
a
lesson
tonight
and
pretty
soon
i
am
going
up
and
try
and
eat
something
and
i
hope
they
do
try
and
hand
me
no
more
of
that
canned
beans
or
whatever
it
was
that
effected
me
and
if
uncle
sam
wants
his
boys
to
go
over
there
and
put
up
a
battle
he
should
try
and
poison
them
first
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
i
was
talking
to
one
of
the
sailors
named
doran
and
he
says
in
a
day
or
more
we
would
be
right
in
the
danger
zone
where
all
the
subs
hangs
out
and
then
would
come
the
fun
and
we
would
probably
all
have
to
keep
our
clothes
on
all
night
and
keep
our
life
belts
on
and
i
asked
him
if
they
was
much
danger
with
all
them
convoys
guarding
us
and
he
says
the
subs
might
fire
a
periscope
right
between
two
of
the
convoys
and
hit
our
ship
and
maybe
the
convoys
might
get
them
afterwards
but
then
it
would
be
to
late
he
said
the
last
time
he
come
over
with
troops
they
was
two
subs
got
after
this
ship
and
they
shot
two
periscopes
at
this
ship
and
just
missed
it
and
they
seem
to
be
laying
for
this
ship
because
its
one
of
the
biggest
and
fastest
the
has
got
well
i
told
doran
it
would
bother
me
to
keep
my
clothes
on
all
night
because
i
all
ready
been
keeping
them
on
all
night
because
when
you
have
got
a
state
room
like
ours
they
only
one
place
where
they
room
for
a
man
clothes
and
that
on
you
well
old
pal
they
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
learning
something
from
somebody
that
knows
what
they
are
talking
about
and
visa
versa
i
and
lee
and
smith
got
together
in
the
room
last
night
and
we
was
at
it
more
than
an
hour
but
i
learned
more
then
all
the
time
i
took
lessons
from
that
flusher
out
to
camp
grant
because
smith
do
waist
no
time
with
a
lot
of
junk
about
grammer
but
i
or
lee
would
ask
him
what
was
the
french
for
so
and
so
and
he
would
tell
us
and
we
would
write
it
down
and
say
it
over
till
we
had
it
down
pat
and
i
bet
we
could
pretty
near
order
a
meal
now
without
no
help
from
some
of
these
smart
alex
that
claims
they
can
talk
all
the
languages
in
the
world
in
the
place
they
a
whole
lot
of
words
in
french
that
they
no
difference
you
might
say
between
them
from
the
way
we
say
it
like
beef
steak
and
beer
because
lee
asked
him
if
suppose
we
went
in
somewheres
and
wanted
a
steak
and
bread
and
butter
and
beer
and
the
french
for
and
is
und
so
we
would
say
beef
steak
und
brot
mit
butter
schmieren
und
bier
and
that
all
they
is
to
it
and
i
can
say
that
without
looking
at
the
paper
where
we
wrote
it
down
and
you
can
see
i
have
got
that
much
learned
all
ready
so
i
would
starve
and
when
you
want
to
call
a
waiter
you
call
him
kellner
so
you
see
i
could
go
in
a
place
in
paris
and
call
a
waiter
and
get
everything
i
wanted
well
al
i
bet
nobody
ever
learned
that
much
in
i
hour
off
that
bird
out
to
camp
grant
and
i
say
its
some
speed
we
are
going
to
have
another
lesson
tonight
but
lee
says
we
do
want
to
try
and
learn
to
much
at
once
or
we
will
forget
what
we
all
ready
learned
and
they
a
good
deal
to
that
al
well
al
its
time
for
chow
again
so
lebe
wohl
and
that
the
same
like
good
by
in
french
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
we
are
in
what
they
call
the
danger
zone
and
they
some
excitement
these
days
and
at
night
to
because
they
do
many
of
the
boys
go
to
sleep
nights
and
they
go
to
their
rooms
and
pretend
like
they
are
going
to
sleep
but
i
bet
you
would
need
no
alarm
clock
to
make
them
jump
out
of
bed
most
of
the
boys
stays
out
on
deck
most
of
the
time
and
i
been
staying
out
there
myself
most
all
day
today
not
because
i
am
scared
of
anything
because
i
always
figure
if
its
going
to
happen
its
going
to
happen
but
i
stay
out
because
it
ai
near
as
cold
as
it
was
and
besides
if
something
is
comeing
off
i
do
want
to
miss
it
besides
maybe
i
could
help
out
some
way
if
something
did
happen
last
night
we
was
all
out
on
deck
in
the
dark
talking
about
this
and
that
and
one
of
the
boys
i
was
standing
along
side
of
him
made
the
remark
that
we
had
been
out
nine
days
and
he
did
see
no
france
yet
or
no
signs
of
getting
there
so
i
said
no
wonder
when
we
had
such
a
he
ll
of
a
censor
ship
and
some
other
guy
heard
me
say
it
so
he
said
i
better
not
talk
like
that
but
i
did
mean
it
like
that
but
only
how
slow
it
was
well
we
are
getting
along
with
the
french
lessons
and
bob
lee
told
me
last
night
that
he
run
across
one
of
the
two
french
officers
that
on
the
ship
and
he
thought
he
would
try
some
of
his
french
on
him
so
he
said
something
about
it
being
a
nice
day
in
french
and
the
frenchman
was
tickled
to
death
and
smiled
and
bowed
at
him
and
i
guess
i
will
try
it
out
on
them
the
next
time
i
see
them
well
al
that
shows
we
been
learning
something
when
the
frenchmans
themself
know
what
we
are
talking
about
and
i
and
lee
will
have
the
laugh
on
the
rest
of
the
boys
when
we
get
there
that
is
if
we
do
get
there
but
for
some
reason
another
i
have
got
a
hunch
that
we
wo
never
see
france
and
i
ca
explain
why
but
once
in
a
while
a
man
gets
a
hunch
and
a
lot
of
times
they
are
generally
always
right
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
al
i
was
just
out
on
deck
with
lee
and
sargent
bishop
and
bishop
is
a
sargent
in
our
and
he
said
he
had
just
came
from
capt
seeley
and
capt
seeley
told
him
to
tell
all
the
officers
like
sargents
and
corporals
that
if
a
sub
got
us
we
was
to
leave
the
privates
get
into
the
boats
first
before
we
got
in
and
we
was
to
get
into
our
boats
till
all
the
privates
was
safe
in
the
boats
because
we
would
probably
be
cooler
and
not
get
all
excited
like
the
privates
so
you
see
al
if
something
does
happen
us
birds
will
have
to
take
things
in
hand
you
might
say
and
we
will
have
to
stick
on
the
job
and
not
think
about
ourselfs
till
everybody
else
is
taken
care
of
well
lee
said
that
doran
one
of
the
sailors
told
him
something
on
the
quiet
that
did
never
get
into
the
newspapers
and
that
was
about
one
of
the
trips
that
come
off
in
december
and
it
seems
like
a
whole
fleet
of
subs
got
on
to
it
that
some
transports
was
comeing
so
they
layed
for
them
and
they
shot
a
periscope
at
one
of
the
transports
and
hit
it
square
in
the
middle
and
it
begun
to
sink
right
away
and
it
looked
like
they
would
nobody
get
into
the
boats
but
the
sargents
and
corporals
was
as
cool
as
if
nothing
was
comeing
off
and
they
quieted
the
soldiers
down
and
finely
got
them
into
the
boats
and
the
officers
was
so
cool
and
done
so
well
that
when
pershing
heard
about
it
he
made
this
rule
about
the
officer
always
waiting
till
the
last
so
they
could
kind
of
handle
things
but
doran
also
told
lee
that
they
was
some
men
sunk
with
the
ship
and
they
was
all
officers
except
one
sailor
and
of
course
the
ship
sunk
so
quick
that
some
of
the
corporals
and
sargents
did
have
no
time
to
get
off
on
acct
of
haveing
to
wait
till
the
last
so
you
see
that
when
you
read
the
newspapers
you
do
get
all
the
dope
because
they
do
tell
the
reporters
only
what
they
feel
like
telling
them
well
al
i
guess
i
told
you
all
ready
about
me
haveing
this
hunch
that
i
would
never
see
france
and
i
guess
it
looks
now
more
then
ever
like
my
hunch
was
right
because
if
we
get
hit
i
will
have
to
kind
of
look
out
for
the
boys
that
in
my
boat
and
not
think
about
myself
till
everybody
else
is
and
doran
says
if
this
ship
ever
does
get
hit
it
will
sink
quick
because
its
so
big
and
heavy
and
of
course
the
heavier
a
ship
is
it
will
sink
all
the
sooner
and
doran
says
he
knows
they
are
laying
for
us
because
he
has
made
five
trips
over
and
back
on
this
ship
and
he
never
was
on
a
trip
when
a
sub
did
get
after
them
well
i
will
close
for
this
time
because
i
am
not
feeling
very
good
al
and
it
is
nothing
i
eat
or
like
that
but
its
just
i
feel
kind
of
faint
like
i
use
to
sometimes
when
i
would
pitch
a
tough
game
in
louis
when
it
was
hot
or
something
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
i
all
ready
wrote
you
one
letter
today
but
i
kind
of
feel
like
i
better
write
to
you
again
because
any
minute
we
are
libel
to
hear
a
bang
against
the
side
of
the
boat
and
you
know
what
that
means
and
i
have
got
a
hunch
that
i
wo
never
get
off
of
the
ship
alive
but
will
go
down
with
her
because
i
would
never
leave
the
ship
as
long
as
they
was
anybody
left
on
her
rules
or
no
rules
but
i
would
stay
and
help
out
till
every
man
was
off
and
then
of
course
it
would
be
to
late
but
any
way
i
would
go
down
feeling
like
i
had
done
my
duty
well
al
when
a
man
has
got
a
hunch
like
that
he
would
be
a
sucker
to
not
pay
no
tension
to
it
and
that
is
why
i
am
writeing
to
you
again
because
i
got
some
things
i
want
to
say
before
the
end
now
old
pal
i
know
that
florrie
has
never
warmed
up
towards
you
and
bertha
and
would
never
go
down
to
bedford
with
me
and
pay
you
a
visit
and
every
time
i
ever
give
her
a
hint
that
i
would
like
to
have
you
and
bertha
come
up
and
see
us
she
always
had
some
excuse
that
she
was
going
to
be
busy
or
this
and
that
and
of
course
i
knew
she
was
trying
to
alibi
herself
and
the
truth
was
she
always
felt
like
bertha
and
her
would
have
nothing
in
common
you
might
say
because
florrie
has
always
been
a
swell
dresser
and
cared
a
whole
lot
about
how
she
looked
and
some
way
she
felt
like
bertha
would
feel
comfortable
around
where
she
was
at
and
maybe
she
was
right
but
we
can
forget
all
that
now
al
and
i
can
say
one
thing
al
she
never
said
nothing
reflecting
on
you
yourself
in
any
way
because
i
of
stood
for
it
but
instead
of
that
when
i
showed
her
that
picture
of
you
and
bertha
in
your
wedding
suit
she
made
the
remark
that
you
looked
like
one
of
the
honest
homely
kind
of
people
that
their
friends
could
always
depend
on
them
well
al
when
she
said
that
she
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
i
always
knew
you
was
the
one
pal
who
i
could
depend
on
and
i
am
depending
on
you
now
and
i
know
that
if
i
am
laying
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
tonight
you
will
see
that
my
wishs
in
this
letter
is
carried
out
to
the
letter
what
i
want
to
say
is
about
florrie
and
little
al
now
do
think
al
that
i
am
going
to
ask
you
for
financial
assistants
because
i
would
know
better
then
that
and
besides
we
do
need
it
on
acct
of
me
having
dollars
soldier
insurence
in
florrie
name
as
the
benefitter
and
the
way
she
is
coining
money
in
that
beauty
parlor
she
wo
need
to
touch
my
insurence
but
save
it
for
little
al
for
a
rainy
day
only
i
suppose
that
the
minute
she
gets
her
hands
on
it
she
will
blow
it
for
widows
weeds
and
i
bet
they
will
be
some
weeds
al
and
everybody
will
think
they
are
flowers
instead
of
weeds
but
what
i
am
getting
at
is
that
she
wo
need
no
money
because
with
what
i
leave
her
and
what
she
can
make
she
has
got
enough
and
more
then
enough
but
i
often
say
that
money
is
the
only
thing
in
this
world
and
a
whole
lot
of
things
pretty
near
as
good
and
one
of
them
is
kindness
and
what
i
am
asking
from
you
and
bertha
is
to
drop
in
on
her
once
in
a
while
up
in
chi
and
pay
her
a
visit
and
i
have
all
ready
wrote
her
a
letter
telling
her
to
ask
you
but
even
if
she
do
ask
you
go
and
see
her
any
way
and
see
how
she
is
getting
along
and
if
she
is
takeing
good
care
of
the
kid
or
leaving
him
with
the
swede
nurse
all
the
while
between
you
and
i
al
what
i
am
scared
of
most
is
that
florrie
mind
will
be
effected
if
anything
happens
to
me
and
without
knowing
what
she
was
doing
she
would
probably
take
the
first
man
that
asked
her
and
believe
me
she
is
not
the
kind
that
would
have
to
wait
around
on
no
corner
to
catch
somebody
eye
but
they
would
follow
her
around
and
nag
at
her
till
she
married
them
and
i
would
feel
like
he
ll
over
it
because
florrie
is
the
kind
of
a
girl
that
has
got
to
be
handled
right
and
not
only
that
but
what
would
become
of
little
al
with
some
horse
for
a
father
in
law
and
probably
this
bird
would
treat
him
like
a
dog
and
beat
him
up
either
that
or
make
a
sissy
out
of
him
well
al
old
pal
i
know
you
will
do
like
i
ask
and
go
and
see
her
and
maybe
you
better
go
alone
but
if
you
do
take
bertha
along
i
guess
it
would
be
better
and
not
let
bertha
say
nothing
to
her
because
florrie
is
the
kind
that
flare
up
easy
and
specially
when
they
think
they
are
a
little
better
then
somebody
but
if
you
could
just
drop
her
a
hint
and
say
that
she
should
ought
to
be
proud
to
be
a
widow
to
a
husband
that
died
for
uncle
sam
and
she
ought
to
live
for
my
memory
and
for
little
al
and
try
and
make
him
as
much
like
i
as
possible
i
believe
it
would
make
her
think
and
any
way
i
want
you
to
do
it
for
me
old
pal
well
good
by
old
pal
and
i
wished
i
could
leave
some
thing
to
you
and
bertha
and
believe
me
i
would
if
i
had
ever
known
this
was
comeing
off
this
way
though
of
course
i
figured
right
along
that
i
would
last
long
in
france
because
what
chance
has
a
corporal
got
but
i
figured
i
would
make
some
arrangements
for
a
little
present
for
you
and
bertha
as
soon
as
i
got
to
france
but
of
course
it
looks
now
like
i
would
never
get
there
and
all
the
money
i
have
got
is
tied
up
so
its
to
late
to
think
of
that
and
all
as
i
can
say
is
good
luck
to
you
and
bertha
and
everybody
in
bedford
and
i
hope
they
will
be
proud
of
me
and
remember
i
done
my
best
and
i
often
say
what
more
can
a
man
do
then
that
well
al
i
will
say
good
by
again
and
good
luck
and
now
have
got
to
quit
and
go
to
chow
your
pal
to
the
last
jack
keefe
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
this
has
been
some
day
and
wait
till
you
hear
about
it
and
hear
what
come
off
and
some
of
the
birds
on
this
ship
took
me
for
a
sucker
and
tried
to
make
a
rummy
out
of
me
but
i
was
wise
to
their
game
and
i
guess
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot
this
time
well
it
was
early
this
and
i
could
sleep
and
i
was
up
on
deck
and
along
come
one
of
them
french
officers
that
been
on
board
all
the
way
over
well
i
thought
i
would
try
myself
out
on
him
like
lee
said
he
done
so
i
give
him
a
salute
and
i
said
to
him
schones
tag
nicht
wahr
like
you
would
say
its
a
beautiful
day
only
i
thought
i
was
saying
it
in
french
but
wait
till
you
hear
about
it
al
well
al
they
ai
nobody
in
the
world
fast
enough
to
of
caught
what
he
said
back
to
me
and
i
wo
never
know
what
he
said
but
i
wo
never
forget
how
he
looked
at
me
and
when
i
took
one
look
at
him
i
seen
we
going
to
get
along
very
good
so
i
turned
around
and
started
up
the
deck
well
he
must
of
flagged
the
first
man
he
seen
and
sent
him
after
me
and
it
was
a
lieut
and
he
come
running
up
to
me
and
stopped
me
and
asked
me
what
was
my
name
and
what
and
etc
and
at
first
i
was
going
to
stall
and
then
i
thought
i
better
not
so
i
told
him
who
i
was
and
he
left
me
go
well
i
did
know
then
what
was
comeing
off
so
i
just
layed
low
and
i
did
have
to
wait
around
long
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
bird
from
the
colonel
staff
found
me
in
the
parlor
and
says
i
was
wanted
right
away
and
when
i
got
to
this
room
there
was
the
and
the
two
frenchmans
and
my
captain
capt
seeley
and
a
couple
others
so
i
saluted
and
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
what
come
off
because
i
ca
remember
all
what
the
colonel
said
but
it
was
something
like
this
in
the
first
place
he
says
corporal
keefe
they
some
little
matters
that
you
have
got
to
explain
and
we
was
going
to
pass
them
up
first
on
the
grounds
that
capt
seeley
said
you
probably
did
know
no
better
but
this
thing
that
come
off
this
ca
be
explained
by
ignorants
so
then
he
says
it
was
reported
that
you
was
standing
on
deck
the
night
before
last
and
you
made
the
remark
that
we
had
a
he
ll
of
a
censor
ship
and
he
says
what
did
you
mean
by
that
so
you
see
al
this
smart
alex
of
a
lee
had
told
me
they
called
the
first
ship
the
censor
ship
and
i
believed
him
at
first
because
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
or
of
course
i
never
would
of
believed
him
because
the
censor
ship
is
no
ship
like
this
kind
of
a
ship
but
means
something
else
so
i
explained
about
that
and
i
seen
capt
seeley
kind
of
crack
a
smile
so
then
i
knew
i
was
so
then
he
pulled
it
on
me
about
speaking
to
capt
somebody
of
the
french
army
in
the
german
language
and
of
course
they
was
only
one
answer
to
that
and
you
see
the
way
it
was
al
all
the
time
smith
was
pretending
to
learn
us
french
he
was
learning
us
german
and
lee
put
him
up
to
it
but
when
the
colonel
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
doing
such
a
thing
as
talk
german
why
of
course
i
knew
in
a
minute
that
they
had
been
trying
to
kid
me
but
at
first
i
told
the
colonel
i
could
of
said
no
german
because
i
do
know
no
more
german
than
silk
well
the
frenchman
was
pretty
sore
and
i
do
know
what
would
of
came
off
only
for
capt
seeley
and
he
spoke
up
and
said
to
the
colonel
that
if
he
could
have
a
few
minutes
to
investigate
he
thought
he
could
clear
things
up
because
he
figured
i
had
intended
to
do
nothing
wrong
and
somebody
had
probably
been
playing
jokes
so
capt
seeley
went
out
and
it
seemed
like
a
couple
of
yrs
till
he
came
back
and
he
had
smith
and
lee
and
doran
with
him
so
then
them
birds
was
up
on
the
carpet
and
i
say
they
got
some
panning
and
when
it
was
all
over
the
colonel
said
something
about
they
being
a
dam
site
to
much
kidding
back
and
fourth
going
on
and
he
hoped
that
before
long
we
would
find
out
that
this
war
was
no
practicle
joke
and
he
give
lee
and
smith
a
fierce
balling
out
and
he
said
he
would
leave
capt
seeley
to
deal
with
them
and
he
would
report
doran
to
the
proper
quarters
and
then
he
was
back
on
me
again
and
he
said
it
looked
like
i
had
been
the
innocent
victim
of
a
practicle
joke
but
he
says
you
are
so
dam
innocent
that
i
figure
you
are
temperately
unfit
to
hold
on
to
a
corporal
warrant
so
you
can
consider
yourself
reduced
to
the
ranks
we
ca
have
no
corporals
that
if
some
comedian
told
them
the
germans
was
now
one
of
our
allies
they
would
try
and
get
in
the
german
trenches
and
shake
hands
with
them
well
al
when
it
was
all
over
i
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
because
you
see
i
come
out
of
it
and
the
laugh
was
on
smith
and
lee
and
doran
because
i
got
just
what
i
wanted
because
i
never
did
want
to
be
a
corporal
because
it
meant
i
could
pal
around
with
the
boys
and
be
their
pals
and
i
never
felt
right
when
i
was
giveing
them
orders
because
i
would
rather
be
just
one
of
them
and
make
them
feel
like
we
were
all
equals
of
course
they
was
no
time
on
the
whole
trip
when
lee
or
doran
or
smith
either
one
of
them
had
me
fooled
because
just
to
look
at
them
you
would
know
they
are
the
kind
of
smart
alex
that
always
trying
to
put
something
over
on
somebody
only
i
figured
two
could
play
at
that
game
as
good
as
one
and
i
would
kid
them
right
back
and
give
them
as
good
as
they
sent
because
i
always
figure
that
the
game
ai
over
till
the
ninth
inning
and
the
man
that
does
the
laughing
then
has
got
all
the
best
of
it
but
at
that
i
bear
no
bad
will
towards
neither
one
of
them
and
i
have
got
a
good
notion
to
ask
capt
seeley
to
let
them
off
easy
well
al
this
is
a
long
letter
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
i
was
no
corporal
no
more
and
if
a
sub
hits
us
now
al
i
can
hop
into
a
boat
as
quick
as
i
feel
like
it
but
jokeing
a
side
if
something
like
that
happened
it
make
no
difference
to
me
if
i
was
a
corporal
or
not
a
corporal
because
i
am
a
man
and
i
would
do
my
best
and
help
the
rest
of
the
boys
get
into
the
boats
before
i
thought
about
myself
your
pal
jack
the
ship
board
friend
al
well
old
pal
just
a
line
to
let
you
know
we
are
out
of
the
danger
zone
and
pretty
near
in
port
and
i
ca
tell
you
where
we
land
at
but
everybody
is
hollering
and
the
band
playing
and
i
guess
the
boys
feels
a
whole
lot
better
then
when
we
was
out
there
where
the
subs
could
get
at
us
but
between
you
and
i
al
i
never
thought
about
the
subs
all
the
way
over
only
when
i
heard
somebody
else
talk
about
them
because
i
always
figure
that
if
they
some
danger
of
that
kind
the
best
way
to
do
is
just
forget
it
and
if
its
going
to
happen
all
right
but
what
the
use
of
worrying
about
it
but
i
suppose
lots
of
people
is
built
different
and
they
have
just
got
to
worry
all
the
while
and
they
get
scared
stiff
just
thinking
about
what
might
happen
but
i
always
say
nobody
ever
got
fat
worrying
so
why
not
just
forget
it
and
take
things
as
they
come
well
old
pal
they
to
many
sights
to
see
so
i
will
quit
for
this
time
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
old
pal
here
we
are
and
its
against
the
rules
to
tell
you
where
we
are
at
but
of
course
it
do
take
no
shylock
to
find
out
because
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
post
mark
that
they
will
put
on
this
letter
any
way
you
could
pronounce
what
the
town
name
is
if
you
seen
it
spelled
out
because
it
is
nothing
like
how
its
spelled
out
and
you
catch
me
trying
to
pronounce
none
of
these
names
or
talk
french
because
i
am
off
of
languages
for
a
while
and
good
old
american
is
good
enough
for
me
eh
al
well
al
now
that
its
all
over
i
guess
we
was
pretty
lucky
to
get
across
the
old
pond
without
no
trouble
because
between
you
and
i
al
i
heard
just
a
little
while
ago
from
one
of
the
boys
that
three
nights
ago
we
was
attacked
and
our
ship
just
missed
getting
hit
by
a
periscope
and
the
destroyers
went
after
the
subs
and
they
was
a
whole
flock
of
them
and
the
reason
we
hear
nothing
is
that
the
death
bombs
do
go
off
till
they
are
way
under
water
so
you
ca
hear
them
but
between
you
and
i
al
the
navy
men
say
they
was
nine
subs
sank
well
i
did
say
nothing
about
it
to
the
man
who
tipped
me
off
but
i
had
a
hunch
that
night
that
something
was
going
on
and
i
do
remember
now
if
it
was
something
i
heard
or
what
it
was
but
i
knew
they
was
something
in
the
air
and
i
was
expecting
every
minute
that
the
signal
would
come
for
us
to
take
to
the
boats
but
they
was
no
necessity
of
that
because
the
destroyers
worked
so
fast
and
besides
they
say
they
do
never
give
no
alarm
till
the
last
minute
because
they
do
want
to
get
everybody
up
at
night
for
nothing
well
any
way
its
all
over
now
and
here
we
are
and
you
ought
to
of
heard
the
people
in
the
town
here
cheer
us
when
we
come
in
and
you
ought
to
see
how
the
girls
look
at
us
and
believe
me
al
they
are
some
girls
its
a
good
thing
i
am
an
old
married
man
or
i
believe
i
would
pretty
near
be
tempted
to
flirt
back
with
some
of
the
ones
that
been
trying
to
get
my
eye
but
the
way
it
is
i
just
give
them
a
smile
and
pass
on
and
they
no
harm
in
that
and
i
figure
a
man
always
ought
to
give
other
people
as
much
pleasure
as
you
can
as
long
as
it
do
harm
nobody
well
al
everybody
busier
then
a
chicken
with
their
head
off
and
i
got
no
more
time
to
write
but
when
we
get
to
where
we
are
going
i
will
have
time
maybe
and
tell
you
how
we
are
getting
along
and
if
you
want
drop
me
a
line
and
i
wish
you
would
send
me
the
chi
papers
once
in
a
while
especially
when
the
baseball
training
trips
starts
but
maybe
they
wo
be
no
jack
keefe
to
send
them
to
by
that
time
but
if
they
do
get
me
i
will
die
fighting
you
know
me
al
your
pal
jack
chapter
ii
private
valentine
in
france
friend
al
well
al
here
i
am
only
i
ca
tell
you
where
its
at
because
the
censor
rubs
it
out
when
you
put
down
the
name
of
a
town
and
besides
that
even
if
i
was
to
write
out
where
we
are
at
you
would
have
no
idear
where
its
at
because
how
you
spell
them
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
name
if
you
tried
to
say
it
for
inst
they
a
town
a
little
ways
from
us
that
when
you
say
it
its
lucy
like
a
gal
or
something
but
when
you
come
to
spell
it
out
its
loucey
like
something
else
well
al
any
way
this
is
where
they
have
got
us
staying
till
we
get
called
up
to
the
front
and
i
ca
hardly
wait
till
that
comes
off
and
some
say
it
may
be
tomorrow
and
others
say
we
are
libel
to
be
here
a
well
i
hope
they
are
wrong
because
i
would
rather
live
in
the
trenches
then
one
of
these
billets
where
they
got
us
and
between
you
and
i
al
its
nothing
more
then
a
barn
just
think
of
a
man
like
i
al
thats
been
use
to
nothing
only
the
best
hotels
in
the
big
league
and
now
they
got
me
staying
in
a
barn
like
i
was
a
horse
or
something
and
i
use
to
think
i
was
cold
when
they
had
us
sleeping
with
imaginery
blankets
out
to
camp
grant
but
i
would
prespire
if
i
was
there
now
after
this
and
when
we
get
through
here
they
can
send
us
up
to
the
north
pole
in
our
undershirt
and
we
would
half
to
keep
moping
the
sweat
off
of
our
forehead
and
set
under
a
electric
fan
to
keep
from
sweltering
well
they
have
got
us
pegged
as
horses
all
right
not
only
because
they
give
us
a
barn
to
live
in
but
also
from
the
way
they
sent
us
here
from
where
we
landed
at
in
france
and
we
made
the
trip
in
cattle
cars
and
of
the
boys
says
they
must
of
got
us
mixed
up
with
the
calvary
or
something
it
certainly
was
some
experience
to
be
rideing
on
one
of
these
french
trains
for
a
man
that
went
back
and
fourth
to
the
different
towns
in
the
big
league
and
back
in
a
special
pullman
and
sometimes
of
them
so
as
we
could
all
have
lower
births
well
we
did
have
no
births
on
the
french
and
it
would
of
done
us
no
good
to
of
had
them
because
you
would
no
sooner
dose
off
when
the
engine
would
let
off
a
screem
that
sounded
like
a
woman
that
seen
a
snake
and
of
the
boys
says
that
on
acct
of
all
the
men
being
in
the
army
they
had
women
doing
the
men
work
and
judgeing
by
the
noise
they
even
had
them
whistleing
for
the
crossings
well
we
finely
got
here
any
way
and
they
signed
us
to
our
different
billets
and
they
of
us
in
this
one
not
counting
a
couple
of
pigs
and
god
knows
how
many
rats
and
a
cow
that
mews
all
night
we
have
done
nothing
yet
only
look
around
but
monday
we
go
to
work
out
to
the
training
grounds
and
they
say
we
wo
only
half
to
march
miles
through
the
mud
and
snow
to
get
there
mean
time
we
set
and
look
out
the
cracks
onto
main
and
every
little
wile
they
a
of
pollutes
marchs
through
or
a
train
of
motor
lauras
takeing
stuff
up
to
the
front
or
bringing
guys
back
that
did
duck
quick
enough
and
to
see
these
frenchmens
march
you
would
think
it
was
fun
but
when
they
have
been
at
it
a
wile
they
will
loose
some
of
their
pep
well
its
warmer
in
bed
then
setting
here
writeing
so
i
will
close
for
this
time
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
i
am
writeing
this
in
the
hut
where
they
try
and
keep
it
warm
and
all
the
boys
that
can
crowd
in
spends
most
of
their
spare
time
here
but
we
do
have
much
spare
time
at
that
because
its
always
one
thing
another
and
i
guess
its
just
as
well
they
keep
us
busy
because
every
time
they
find
out
you
are
not
doing
nothing
they
begin
vaxinating
everybody
they
enough
noise
in
here
so
as
a
man
ca
hear
yourself
think
let
alone
writeing
a
letter
so
if
i
make
mistakes
in
spelling
and
etc
in
this
letter
you
will
know
why
it
is
they
are
singing
the
song
now
about
the
prayer
at
twilight
where
the
little
girl
is
supposed
to
be
praying
for
her
daddy
that
a
soldier
to
take
care
of
himself
but
if
she
was
here
now
she
would
be
praying
for
him
to
shut
up
his
noise
well
we
was
in
the
trenchs
all
day
not
the
regular
ones
but
the
ones
they
got
for
us
to
train
in
them
and
they
was
a
bunch
of
french
officers
trying
to
learn
us
how
to
do
this
in
that
and
etc
and
some
of
the
time
you
could
all
most
understand
what
they
was
trying
to
tell
you
and
then
it
was
stuff
we
learnt
the
first
wk
out
to
camp
grant
and
i
suppose
when
they
get
so
as
they
can
speak
a
few
words
of
english
they
will
tell
us
we
ought
to
stand
up
when
we
hear
the
star
spangle
banner
well
we
was
a
pretty
sight
when
we
got
back
with
the
mud
and
slush
and
everything
and
by
the
time
they
get
ready
to
call
us
into
action
they
will
half
to
page
us
in
the
morgue
about
every
or
miles
today
we
would
pass
through
a
town
where
some
of
the
rest
of
the
boys
has
got
their
billets
only
they
do
call
it
miles
in
france
because
that
to
easy
to
say
but
instead
of
miles
they
call
them
kilometts
but
any
way
from
the
number
of
jerk
water
burgs
we
went
through
you
would
think
we
was
on
the
monon
and
the
towns
all
looks
so
much
like
the
other
that
when
one
of
the
french
soldiers
gets
a
few
days
leave
off
they
half
to
spend
most
of
it
looking
for
land
marks
so
as
they
will
know
if
they
are
where
they
live
and
they
could
even
be
sure
if
it
was
warm
weather
and
their
folks
was
standing
out
in
front
of
the
house
because
all
the
familys
is
just
alike
with
the
old
and
the
and
pigs
and
a
cow
and
a
dog
well
al
they
say
its
pretty
quite
these
days
up
to
the
front
and
the
boys
that
been
around
here
a
wile
says
you
can
hear
the
guns
when
something
doing
and
the
wind
blows
this
way
but
we
have
heard
no
guns
yet
only
our
own
out
to
where
we
have
riffle
practice
but
everybody
says
as
soon
as
spring
comes
and
the
weather
warms
up
the
germans
is
sure
to
start
something
well
i
do
care
if
they
start
anything
or
not
just
so
the
weather
warms
up
and
besides
they
wo
never
finish
what
they
start
unless
they
start
going
back
home
and
they
wo
even
finish
that
unless
they
show
a
whole
lot
more
speed
then
they
did
comeing
they
are
just
trying
to
throw
a
scare
into
somebody
with
a
lot
of
junk
about
a
big
drive
they
are
going
to
make
but
i
have
seen
birds
come
up
to
hit
in
baseball
al
that
was
going
to
drive
it
out
of
the
park
but
their
drive
turned
out
to
be
a
hump
back
liner
to
the
pitcher
i
remember
once
when
speaker
come
up
with
a
couple
men
on
and
we
was
runs
ahead
in
the
inning
and
he
says
to
me
well
busher
here
is
where
i
hit
one
a
mile
well
al
he
hit
one
a
mile
all
right
but
it
was
a
mile
up
and
the
other
a
mile
down
and
that
the
way
it
goes
with
them
gabby
guys
and
its
the
same
way
with
the
germans
and
they
talk
all
the
time
so
as
they
will
get
thirsty
and
that
how
they
like
to
be
speaking
about
thirsty
al
its
different
over
here
then
at
home
because
when
a
man
in
uniform
wants
a
drink
over
here
you
do
half
to
hire
no
room
in
a
hotel
and
put
on
your
nightgown
but
you
can
get
it
here
in
your
uniform
only
what
they
call
beer
here
we
would
pore
it
on
our
wheat
cakes
at
home
and
they
got
kinds
of
wine
red
and
white
that
you
could
climb
outside
of
a
bbl
of
it
without
asking
the
head
waiter
to
have
them
play
the
rosery
but
they
say
the
champagne
is
and
i
am
going
to
tackle
it
when
i
get
a
chance
and
you
may
think
from
that
that
i
have
got
jack
to
throw
away
but
over
here
al
is
where
they
make
the
champagne
and
you
can
get
a
qt
of
it
for
about
a
buck
or
what
you
would
pay
for
it
in
the
and
besides
that
the
money
they
got
here
is
a
frank
instead
of
a
dollar
and
a
frank
is
only
worth
about
cents
so
a
man
can
have
a
whole
lot
better
time
here
and
not
cost
him
near
as
much
and
another
place
where
the
people
in
france
has
got
it
on
the
americans
and
that
is
that
when
they
write
a
letter
here
they
do
half
to
pay
nothing
to
mail
it
but
when
you
write
to
me
you
have
got
to
stick
a
cent
stamp
on
it
but
judgeing
by
the
way
you
answer
my
letters
the
war
will
be
all
over
before
you
half
to
break
a
dime
of
course
i
am
just
jokeing
al
and
i
know
why
you
do
write
much
because
you
have
got
nothing
to
write
staying
there
in
bedford
and
you
could
take
a
post
card
and
tell
me
all
the
news
that
happened
in
yrs
and
still
have
room
enough
yet
to
say
bertha
sends
kind
regards
but
of
course
its
different
with
a
man
like
i
because
i
am
always
where
they
is
something
big
going
on
and
first
it
was
baseball
and
now
its
a
bigger
game
yet
you
might
say
but
whatever
is
going
on
big
you
can
always
count
on
me
being
in
the
mist
of
it
and
not
buried
alive
in
no
indiana
x
roads
where
they
still
think
the
first
bounce
is
out
but
of
course
i
know
it
is
not
your
fault
that
you
have
been
around
and
seen
more
and
it
ai
every
man
that
can
get
away
from
a
small
town
and
make
a
name
for
themself
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
consider
myself
lucky
well
al
enough
for
this
time
and
i
will
write
soon
again
and
i
would
like
to
hear
from
you
even
if
you
have
nothing
to
say
and
do
forget
to
send
me
a
chi
paper
when
you
get
a
hold
of
one
and
i
asked
florrie
to
send
me
one
every
day
but
asking
her
for
favors
is
like
rolling
off
a
back
you
might
say
and
its
first
in
one
ear
and
then
the
other
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
i
suppose
you
have
read
articles
in
the
papers
about
the
war
that
wrote
over
here
by
reporters
and
the
way
they
do
it
is
they
find
out
something
and
then
write
it
up
and
send
it
by
cablegrams
to
their
papers
and
then
they
print
it
and
that
what
you
read
in
the
papers
well
al
they
a
whole
flock
of
these
here
reporters
over
here
and
i
guess
they
one
for
every
big
paper
in
the
and
they
all
wear
bands
around
their
sleeves
with
a
c
on
them
for
civilian
or
something
so
as
you
can
spot
them
comeing
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
well
they
have
got
their
head
quarters
in
one
of
the
towns
along
the
line
but
they
ride
all
over
the
camp
in
automobiles
and
this
evening
i
was
outside
of
our
billet
and
one
of
them
come
along
and
seen
me
and
got
out
of
his
car
and
come
up
to
me
and
asked
if
i
was
jack
keefe
the
white
sox
pitcher
well
al
he
writes
for
one
of
the
chi
papers
and
of
course
he
knows
all
about
me
and
has
seen
me
work
well
he
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
this
in
that
and
i
did
give
him
no
military
secrets
but
he
asked
me
how
did
i
like
the
army
game
and
etc
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
mention
about
me
being
here
in
the
paper
and
he
says
the
censors
would
stand
for
mentioning
no
names
until
you
get
killed
because
if
they
mentioned
your
name
the
germans
would
know
who
all
was
here
but
after
you
are
dead
the
germans
do
care
if
you
had
been
here
or
not
but
he
says
he
would
put
it
in
the
paper
that
he
was
talking
to
a
man
that
use
to
be
a
star
pitcher
on
the
white
sox
and
he
says
everybody
would
know
who
it
was
he
was
talking
about
because
they
was
such
a
slue
of
star
pitchers
in
the
army
that
it
would
take
a
civil
service
detective
to
find
out
who
he
meant
so
we
talked
along
and
finely
he
asked
me
was
i
going
to
write
a
book
about
the
war
and
i
said
no
and
he
says
all
right
he
would
tell
the
paper
that
he
had
ran
across
a
soldier
that
not
only
use
to
be
a
ball
player
but
going
to
write
a
book
and
they
would
make
a
big
story
out
of
it
so
i
said
i
would
know
how
to
go
about
it
to
write
a
book
but
when
i
went
around
the
world
with
the
ball
clubs
that
time
i
use
to
write
some
poultry
once
in
a
wile
just
for
different
occasions
like
where
the
boys
was
called
on
for
a
speech
or
something
and
they
did
know
what
to
say
so
i
would
make
up
one
of
my
poems
and
the
people
would
go
nuts
over
them
so
he
said
why
did
i
tear
off
a
few
patriotic
poems
now
and
slip
them
to
him
and
he
would
send
them
to
his
paper
and
they
would
print
them
and
maybe
if
some
of
them
was
good
enough
somebody
would
set
down
and
write
a
song
to
them
and
probably
everybody
would
want
to
buy
it
and
sing
it
like
over
there
and
i
would
clean
up
a
good
peace
of
jack
well
al
i
told
him
i
would
see
if
i
could
think
up
something
to
write
and
of
course
i
was
just
stalling
him
because
a
soldier
has
got
something
better
to
do
than
write
songs
and
i
will
leave
that
to
the
birds
that
was
gun
shy
and
stayed
home
but
if
you
see
in
the
chi
papers
where
one
of
the
reporters
was
talking
to
a
soldier
that
use
to
be
a
star
pitcher
in
the
american
league
or
something
you
will
know
who
they
mean
he
said
he
would
drop
by
in
a
few
days
again
and
see
if
i
had
something
wrote
up
for
him
but
i
will
half
to
tell
him
i
have
been
to
busy
to
monkey
with
it
as
far
as
i
can
see
they
enough
songs
all
ready
wrote
up
about
the
war
so
as
everybody
in
the
army
and
navy
could
have
a
peace
and
still
have
a
few
left
over
for
the
boshs
and
that
a
name
we
got
up
for
the
germans
al
and
instead
of
calling
them
germans
we
call
them
boshs
on
acct
of
them
being
so
full
of
bunk
well
al
one
of
the
burgs
along
the
line
is
where
jonah
vark
was
born
when
she
was
alive
it
seems
like
france
was
mixed
up
in
another
war
along
about
a
yrs
ago
and
they
was
getting
licked
and
jonah
was
just
a
young
gal
but
she
dressed
up
in
men
coat
and
pants
and
went
up
to
the
front
and
led
the
charges
with
a
horse
and
she
carried
a
white
flag
and
the
dutchmens
or
whoever
they
was
fighting
against
must
of
thought
it
was
a
flag
of
truants
and
any
way
they
did
fire
at
them
and
the
french
captured
new
orleans
and
win
the
war
the
germans
is
trying
to
pull
the
same
stuff
on
our
boys
now
and
lots
of
times
they
run
up
and
holler
conrad
like
they
was
going
to
give
up
and
when
your
back
is
turned
they
whang
away
at
you
but
they
pull
none
of
that
stuff
on
me
and
when
one
of
them
trys
to
conrad
me
i
will
perculate
them
with
a
bayonet
well
al
the
boys
is
starting
their
choir
practice
and
its
good
night
and
some
times
i
wished
i
was
a
deef
and
dumb
mute
and
could
hear
nothing
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
i
did
have
nothing
to
do
last
night
and
i
happened
to
think
about
that
reporter
and
how
he
would
be
comeing
along
in
a
few
days
asking
for
that
poultry
i
figured
i
might
as
well
set
down
and
write
him
up
a
couple
verses
because
them
fellows
is
hard
up
for
articles
to
send
their
paper
because
in
the
first
place
we
do
tell
them
nothing
so
they
could
write
it
up
and
when
they
write
it
the
censors
smeers
out
everything
but
the
question
marks
and
dots
but
of
course
they
would
leave
them
send
poems
because
the
germans
could
make
head
or
tale
out
of
them
so
any
way
i
set
down
and
tore
off
verses
and
he
says
they
ought
to
be
something
about
a
gal
in
it
so
here
is
what
i
wrote
a
year
ago
today
pres
wilson
of
the
had
something
to
say
germany
you
better
keep
away
this
is
no
time
for
play
when
it
come
time
to
go
america
was
not
slow
each
one
said
good
by
to
their
girl
so
dear
and
some
of
them
has
been
over
here
since
last
will
come
home
when
the
war
is
over
back
to
the
a
so
do
worry
little
girlie
and
now
we
are
going
to
berlin
and
when
we
the
kaiser
skin
and
the
war
we
will
win
and
make
the
kaiser
jump
out
of
his
ones
that
stays
at
home
can
subscribe
to
the
liberty
loan
and
some
day
we
will
come
home
to
the
girles
that
left
alone
old
kaiser
bill
is
up
against
it
for
all
are
doing
their
bit
pres
wilson
says
the
stars
and
stripes
will
always
fight
for
their
that
what
i
tore
off
and
when
he
comes
around
again
i
will
have
it
for
him
and
if
you
see
it
in
the
chi
papers
you
will
know
who
wrote
it
up
and
maybe
somebody
will
write
a
song
to
it
but
of
course
they
ca
sign
my
name
to
it
unless
i
get
killed
or
something
but
i
guess
at
that
they
so
many
soldiers
over
here
that
can
turn
out
stuff
like
that
but
what
my
friends
wo
be
pretty
sure
who
wrote
it
but
if
something
does
happen
to
me
i
wished
you
would
kind
of
keep
your
eyes
pealed
and
if
the
song
comes
out
try
and
see
that
florrie
gets
some
jack
out
of
it
and
i
have
wrote
nothing
to
her
about
it
because
she
is
like
all
other
wifes
and
when
somebodys
else
husband
pulls
something
its
but
if
their
own
husband
does
it
he
must
of
had
a
snoot
full
well
today
was
so
rotten
that
they
did
make
us
go
nowheres
and
i
say
its
got
to
be
pretty
rotten
when
they
do
that
and
the
meal
they
give
us
tonight
would
of
bulged
out
a
grandaddy
long
legs
and
i
and
my
buddy
frank
carson
was
both
hungry
after
we
eat
and
i
suppose
you
will
wonder
what
do
i
mean
by
buddy
well
al
that
a
name
i
got
up
for
who
ever
you
pal
around
with
or
bunk
next
to
them
and
now
everybody
calls
their
pal
their
buddy
well
any
way
he
says
why
did
we
go
over
to
the
red
x
canteen
resturent
and
buy
ourself
a
feed
so
we
went
over
and
its
a
little
shack
where
the
red
x
serves
you
a
pretty
good
meal
for
frank
and
about
cents
and
they
do
try
and
make
no
profits
on
it
but
just
run
them
so
as
a
man
do
half
to
go
along
all
the
wile
on
what
the
army
hands
out
to
you
well
they
was
janes
on
the
job
over
there
and
of
them
would
be
safe
anywheres
you
put
them
but
the
other
one
is
class
a
and
her
old
woman
must
of
been
pie
eyed
when
she
left
her
come
over
here
well
carson
said
she
belonged
to
him
because
he
had
seen
her
before
and
besides
i
was
a
married
man
so
i
says
all
right
go
ahead
and
get
her
well
al
it
would
be
like
terre
haute
going
after
george
sisler
or
somebody
and
the
minute
we
blowed
in
she
did
have
eyes
for
only
me
but
i
was
going
to
give
her
no
encouragement
because
we
were
here
to
kill
germans
and
not
ladys
but
i
wished
you
could
of
seen
the
smile
she
give
me
well
she
just
as
much
a
american
as
i
or
you
but
of
course
carson
had
to
be
cute
and
try
to
pull
some
of
his
french
on
her
so
he
says
bon
soir
madam
moselle
and
that
is
the
same
like
we
would
say
good
evening
but
when
carson
pulled
it
i
spoke
up
and
said
if
your
bones
is
soir
why
do
you
go
and
take
the
baths
somewhere
pretending
like
i
thought
he
meant
his
bones
were
sore
well
the
little
lady
got
it
and
pretty
near
laughed
outright
you
see
al
when
a
person
has
got
rhuematism
they
go
and
take
the
baths
like
down
to
mudlavia
so
i
meant
if
his
bones
was
sore
he
better
go
somewheres
like
that
so
the
little
lady
tried
to
not
laugh
on
acct
of
me
being
a
stranger
but
she
could
hardly
help
from
busting
out
and
then
i
smiled
at
her
back
and
after
that
carson
might
as
well
of
been
mowing
the
lawn
out
in
land
i
felt
kind
of
sorry
the
way
things
broke
because
here
he
is
a
man
without
no
home
ties
and
of
course
i
have
all
ready
got
a
wife
but
miss
moselle
did
have
no
eyes
for
him
and
that
the
way
it
goes
but
what
can
a
man
do
and
carson
seen
how
it
was
going
and
says
to
me
right
in
front
of
her
have
you
heard
from
your
since
we
been
over
and
i
did
dast
look
up
and
see
how
she
took
it
well
they
set
us
up
a
pretty
good
feed
and
the
little
lady
kept
asking
us
questions
like
how
long
had
we
been
here
and
what
part
of
the
we
come
from
and
etc
and
finely
carson
told
her
who
i
was
and
she
popped
her
eyes
out
and
says
she
use
to
go
to
the
ball
games
once
in
a
wile
in
city
with
her
old
man
and
she
did
never
think
she
would
meet
a
big
league
pitcher
and
talk
to
them
and
she
says
she
wondered
if
she
ever
seen
me
pitch
well
i
guess
if
she
had
she
would
remember
it
specially
in
because
there
was
one
club
i
always
made
them
look
like
a
fool
and
they
was
the
only
club
at
that
and
i
guess
they
about
other
clubs
in
the
american
league
that
if
they
had
seen
my
name
in
the
dead
they
shed
off
enough
tears
to
gum
up
the
infield
well
when
we
come
out
she
asked
us
would
we
come
again
and
we
said
yes
but
i
guess
its
best
for
both
she
and
i
if
i
stay
away
but
i
said
we
would
come
again
to
be
polite
so
she
said
au
revoir
and
that
like
you
would
say
so
long
so
i
said
au
reservoir
pretending
like
i
did
know
the
right
way
to
say
it
but
she
seen
i
was
just
kidding
and
laughed
and
she
is
the
kind
of
a
gal
that
gets
everything
you
pull
and
bright
as
a
whip
and
her
and
i
would
make
a
good
team
but
of
course
they
no
use
talking
about
it
the
way
i
am
tied
up
so
even
when
i
sick
in
tired
of
the
regular
rations
i
wo
dast
go
over
there
for
a
feed
because
it
could
do
nothing
only
harm
to
the
both
of
us
and
the
best
way
to
do
with
those
kind
of
affairs
is
to
cut
it
out
before
somebody
gets
hurt
well
its
time
to
hop
into
the
feathers
and
i
only
wished
it
was
feathers
but
feathers
comes
off
a
chicken
or
something
and
i
guess
these
matteresses
we
got
is
made
out
to
gary
or
indiana
harbor
or
somewheres
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
they
several
of
the
boys
that
wo
need
no
motor
laura
to
carry
their
pay
for
the
next
couple
mos
and
if
you
was
to
mention
champagne
to
them
they
would
ask
for
a
barrage
i
was
over
to
the
hut
last
night
and
when
i
come
back
i
wished
you
could
of
seen
my
buddys
and
they
was
of
them
that
was
still
able
to
talk
yet
and
they
was
haveing
a
argument
because
one
of
them
wanted
to
pore
some
champagne
in
a
dish
so
as
the
rats
would
get
stewed
and
the
other
bird
was
trying
to
not
let
him
because
he
said
it
always
made
them
mean
and
they
would
go
home
and
beat
up
their
mrs
it
seems
like
one
of
the
boys
had
a
birthday
and
his
folks
is
well
off
and
they
had
sent
him
some
jack
from
the
states
to
buy
blankets
and
etc
with
it
and
he
thought
it
would
be
a
sucker
play
to
load
up
with
bed
close
when
spring
was
comeing
so
he
loaded
up
with
something
else
and
some
of
the
boys
with
him
and
for
or
franks
over
here
you
can
get
enough
champagne
to
keep
the
dust
layed
all
summer
and
of
course
some
of
the
boys
had
never
tasted
it
before
and
they
thought
you
could
bathe
in
it
like
beer
they
did
pay
no
more
tension
to
revelry
this
then
if
they
was
a
corps
and
most
of
them
was
at
that
and
out
of
the
whole
bunch
of
us
they
was
only
that
did
get
reported
and
the
others
got
soaked
thirds
of
their
pay
and
confined
to
their
quarters
and
capt
seeley
says
if
they
was
any
more
birthdays
in
his
we
would
wind
the
celebration
up
till
sunrise
and
then
it
would
be
in
front
of
a
fireing
squad
well
al
if
the
boys
handle
it
no
better
then
that
they
better
leave
it
alone
and
just
because
its
cheap
that
no
reason
to
try
and
get
it
all
at
once
because
the
grapes
will
still
be
growing
over
here
yet
when
all
us
birds
takes
our
teeth
off
at
night
with
our
other
close
well
al
the
reporter
that
asked
me
to
write
up
the
verses
ai
been
around
since
and
probably
he
has
went
up
to
the
front
or
somewheres
and
i
am
glad
of
it
and
i
hope
he
forgets
all
about
it
because
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
one
of
the
kind
that
is
crazy
to
get
in
the
papers
and
besides
i
am
to
busy
to
be
monking
with
stuff
like
that
yes
they
keep
us
on
the
jump
all
the
wile
and
we
are
pretty
well
wore
out
when
night
comes
around
but
a
man
would
mind
it
if
we
was
learning
something
but
the
way
it
is
now
its
like
as
if
we
had
graduated
from
college
and
then
they
sent
us
to
kindegarden
and
outside
of
maybe
a
few
skulls
the
whole
regt
is
ready
right
now
to
get
up
there
in
the
trenches
and
show
them
something
and
i
only
wished
we
was
going
tomorrow
but
i
guess
some
of
the
boys
would
like
it
to
never
go
up
there
but
would
rather
stay
here
in
this
burg
and
think
they
was
haveing
a
good
time
kidding
with
the
french
gals
and
etc
but
that
no
business
for
a
married
man
and
even
if
i
did
have
no
family
the
french
gals
i
seen
so
far
would
half
to
shew
me
away
and
i
been
hearing
all
my
life
what
swell
dressers
they
was
but
a
scout
for
the
follys
would
waist
no
time
in
this
burg
but
i
sick
in
tired
of
the
same
thing
day
in
and
day
out
and
here
we
been
in
france
wks
and
all
we
done
is
a
little
riffle
practice
and
stuff
we
had
back
home
and
get
soping
wet
every
day
and
no
mail
and
i
wonder
if
florrie
and
little
al
had
forgot
all
about
me
and
if
secty
daniels
wired
them
that
jack
keefe
had
been
killed
they
would
say
who
and
the
hell
is
he
so
all
and
all
they
ca
send
us
up
to
the
front
to
quick
and
it
seems
like
a
shame
that
men
like
i
should
be
held
back
just
because
they
a
few
birds
in
the
regt
that
ca
put
on
a
gas
mask
yet
without
triping
themself
up
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
wait
till
you
hear
this
and
i
bet
you
will
pop
your
eyes
out
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
about
miss
moselle
the
little
lady
over
to
the
red
x
canteen
well
i
was
over
there
the
day
before
yesterday
and
she
was
around
nowheres
and
i
was
glad
of
it
because
i
did
want
to
see
her
and
just
dropped
in
there
to
get
something
to
eat
and
today
i
was
in
there
again
and
this
time
she
was
there
and
she
smiled
when
she
seen
me
and
come
up
and
begin
talking
and
she
asked
me
how
i
liked
it
and
i
said
i
would
like
it
a
whole
lot
better
if
we
was
in
the
fighting
and
she
asked
me
if
i
did
like
this
town
and
i
said
well
no
i
was
nuts
about
it
and
she
said
she
did
think
i
was
very
complementary
so
then
i
seen
she
wanted
to
get
personal
well
al
she
knows
i
am
a
married
man
because
carson
just
as
good
as
told
her
so
i
did
see
no
harm
in
kidding
her
along
a
wile
so
i
give
her
a
smile
and
said
well
you
know
the
whole
town
ai
like
you
and
she
blushed
up
and
says
well
i
did
expect
nothing
like
that
from
a
great
baseball
pitcher
so
you
see
al
she
had
been
makeing
inquirys
about
me
so
i
said
well
they
was
only
one
pitcher
i
ever
heard
of
that
could
talk
and
that
was
dummy
taylor
but
at
that
they
a
whole
lot
of
them
that
if
they
could
say
my
arm
sore
they
might
as
well
be
tongue
tied
but
i
told
her
i
was
one
of
those
kind
and
i
guest
when
it
came
to
talking
i
could
give
as
good
as
i
sent
and
she
asked
me
was
i
a
college
man
and
i
kidded
her
along
and
said
yes
i
went
to
harvard
and
she
said
what
year
so
i
told
her
i
was
there
different
yrs
and
we
talked
along
about
this
in
that
and
i
happened
to
have
them
verses
in
my
pocket
that
i
wrote
up
and
they
dropped
out
when
i
was
after
my
pocket
book
and
she
acted
like
she
wanted
to
know
what
the
writeing
was
so
i
showed
them
to
her
well
al
i
wished
you
could
of
seen
how
supprised
she
was
when
she
read
them
and
she
says
so
you
are
a
poet
so
i
said
yes
i
am
a
poet
and
do
know
it
so
that
made
her
laugh
and
i
told
her
about
the
reporter
asking
me
to
write
some
poems
and
then
she
asked
me
if
she
could
keep
a
hold
of
those
ones
till
she
made
out
a
copy
of
them
to
keep
for
herself
and
i
said
you
can
keep
that
copy
and
pretend
like
i
was
thinking
of
you
when
i
wrote
them
well
al
i
wished
you
could
of
seen
her
then
and
she
could
say
nothing
at
first
but
finely
she
says
tomorrow
was
valentine
day
and
the
verses
would
do
for
a
valentine
so
just
jokeing
i
asked
her
if
she
rather
have
a
comical
valentine
and
she
says
those
ones
would
do
so
then
i
told
her
i
would
write
her
a
real
valentine
for
herself
but
i
might
maybe
not
get
it
ready
in
time
to
give
her
tomorrow
and
she
says
she
realized
it
took
time
and
any
time
would
do
well
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
write
up
nothing
for
her
and
after
this
i
will
keep
away
from
the
canteen
because
it
is
right
to
leave
her
see
to
much
of
me
even
if
she
does
know
i
am
married
but
if
i
do
write
her
something
i
will
make
it
comical
and
no
mushy
stuff
in
it
but
it
does
seem
like
fate
or
something
that
the
harder
i
try
and
not
get
mixed
up
in
a
flirtation
i
ca
turn
around
you
might
say
but
what
they
some
gal
poping
up
on
my
trail
and
if
it
was
anybody
else
only
miss
moselle
i
would
mind
but
she
is
a
darb
and
i
would
do
nothing
to
hurt
her
for
the
world
but
they
ca
nobody
say
this
is
my
fault
well
al
i
pretty
near
forgot
to
tell
you
that
the
boys
is
putting
on
a
entertainment
over
to
the
saturday
night
and
they
will
be
singing
and
gags
and
etc
and
they
asked
me
would
i
give
them
a
little
talk
on
baseball
and
i
said
no
at
first
but
they
begged
me
and
finely
i
give
my
consent
but
you
know
how
i
hate
makeing
speeches
and
etc
but
a
man
hardly
feel
like
refuseing
when
they
want
me
so
bad
so
i
am
going
to
give
them
a
little
talk
on
my
experiences
and
make
it
comical
and
i
will
tell
you
about
the
entertainment
when
its
over
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
i
just
been
over
to
the
canteen
and
i
give
the
little
lady
the
valentine
i
promised
to
write
up
for
her
and
i
was
going
to
write
it
up
only
i
happened
to
remember
that
i
promised
so
i
wrote
something
up
and
i
was
going
to
make
it
comical
but
i
figured
that
would
disappoint
her
on
acct
of
the
way
she
feels
towards
me
so
here
is
what
i
wrote
up
miss
soldier
do
have
much
time
to
set
down
and
write
up
a
valentine
but
please
bear
in
mind
that
i
think
about
you
many
a
time
and
i
wished
i
could
call
you
mine
and
i
hope
they
will
come
a
time
when
i
will
have
more
time
and
then
everything
will
be
fine
and
if
you
will
be
my
valentine
i
will
try
and
show
you
a
good
well
after
i
had
wrote
it
i
thought
i
better
have
it
fixed
up
like
a
valentine
and
they
one
of
the
boys
in
our
named
stoops
that
use
to
be
a
artist
so
i
had
him
draw
me
a
couple
of
hearts
with
a
bow
and
arrow
sticking
through
them
and
a
few
flowers
on
a
peace
of
card
board
and
i
coppied
off
the
valentine
on
the
card
in
printing
and
stuck
it
in
a
envelope
and
took
it
over
to
her
and
i
did
wait
for
her
to
open
it
up
and
look
at
it
and
i
just
says
here
is
that
valentine
i
promised
you
and
its
day
late
and
she
blushed
up
and
could
say
nothing
and
i
come
away
well
al
she
has
read
it
by
this
time
and
i
hope
she
do
take
nothing
i
said
serious
but
of
course
she
knows
i
am
a
married
man
and
she
can
read
between
the
lines
and
see
where
i
am
trying
to
let
her
down
easy
and
telling
her
to
not
expect
no
more
tensions
from
me
and
its
just
like
saying
good
by
to
her
in
a
way
only
not
as
rough
as
comeing
right
out
and
saying
it
but
i
wo
see
her
no
more
and
its
all
over
before
it
begun
you
might
say
well
we
passed
some
german
prisoners
today
and
believe
me
we
give
them
a
ride
everybody
called
them
heinie
and
fritz
and
i
seen
one
of
them
giveing
me
a
look
like
he
was
wondring
if
all
the
soldiers
was
big
stroppers
like
i
but
i
stuck
out
my
tongue
at
him
and
said
what
do
you
think
you
are
looking
at
you
big
pretzel
and
he
did
dast
say
nothing
back
well
they
was
a
fine
looking
gang
and
they
been
a
lot
of
storys
going
the
rounds
about
no
soap
in
germany
well
al
its
all
true
well
i
finely
got
a
letter
from
florrie
that
is
if
you
could
call
it
a
letter
and
to
read
it
you
would
never
guess
that
she
had
a
husband
over
here
in
france
and
maybe
never
see
him
again
but
you
would
think
i
had
went
across
the
to
get
a
bottle
of
ketchup
and
all
as
she
said
about
little
al
was
that
he
needed
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
they
about
as
much
news
in
that
as
if
she
said
he
woke
up
in
the
night
and
the
rest
of
the
letter
was
about
how
good
she
was
doing
in
the
beauty
parlor
and
for
me
not
to
worry
about
her
because
she
was
only
for
a
callous
on
her
heel
and
i
suppose
she
will
go
to
the
hospital
with
it
and
here
i
am
with
so
many
of
them
that
if
they
was
worth
a
frank
a
peace
i
could
pay
the
kaiser
gas
bill
and
she
never
asked
me
did
i
need
anything
or
how
was
i
getting
along
and
she
enclosed
a
snapshot
of
herself
in
one
of
these
here
war
bride
outfits
and
she
looks
so
good
in
it
that
i
bet
she
goes
to
church
every
sunday
and
asks
god
to
prolongate
the
war
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
they
a
certain
bird
in
this
camp
that
if
i
ever
find
out
who
he
is
they
wo
need
no
tonnages
to
carry
him
back
when
the
over
let
me
tell
you
what
come
off
tonight
and
what
was
pulled
off
on
the
little
lady
and
i
and
if
you
read
about
me
getting
in
front
of
the
court
marshall
for
murder
you
will
know
how
it
come
off
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
about
the
show
that
was
comeing
off
tonight
and
they
asked
me
to
make
a
little
talk
on
baseball
well
they
was
as
many
there
as
could
crowd
in
and
the
band
played
and
they
was
singing
and
gags
and
storys
and
etc
and
they
did
call
on
me
till
pretty
near
the
last
well
al
you
ought
to
of
heard
the
crowd
when
i
got
up
there
and
it
sounded
like
old
times
to
have
them
all
cheering
and
clapping
and
i
stepped
to
the
front
of
the
platform
and
give
them
a
bow
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
was
ever
on
the
stage
but
i
was
scared
only
at
first
well
i
had
wrote
out
what
i
was
going
to
say
and
learnt
the
most
of
it
by
heart
and
here
is
what
i
give
them
only
i
wo
give
you
only
part
of
it
because
it
run
pretty
long
gentlemen
and
friends
i
am
no
speech
maker
and
i
guess
if
i
had
to
make
speeches
for
a
liveing
i
am
afraid
i
could
do
it
but
the
boys
is
anxious
i
should
say
a
few
words
about
baseball
and
i
did
want
to
disappoint
them
they
may
be
some
of
you
boys
that
has
not
followed
the
great
american
game
very
close
and
maybe
do
know
who
jack
keefe
is
well
gentlemen
i
was
boughten
from
terre
haute
in
the
central
league
by
that
grand
old
roman
charley
comiskey
owner
of
the
chicago
white
sox
in
and
i
been
in
the
big
league
ever
since
except
one
year
i
was
with
frisco
and
i
stood
that
league
on
their
head
and
comiskey
called
me
back
and
i
was
still
starring
with
the
chicago
white
sox
when
uncle
sam
sent
out
the
call
for
men
and
i
quit
the
great
american
game
to
enlist
in
the
greatest
game
of
all
the
game
we
are
playing
against
the
kaiser
and
we
will
win
this
game
like
i
have
win
many
a
game
of
baseball
because
i
was
to
fast
for
them
and
used
my
brains
and
it
will
be
the
same
with
the
kaiser
and
america
will
fight
to
the
drop
of
the
hat
and
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
well
al
i
had
to
stop
or
minutes
while
they
give
me
a
hand
and
they
clapped
and
hollered
at
pretty
near
everything
i
said
so
i
said
this
war
reminds
me
a
good
deal
like
a
incident
that
happened
once
when
i
was
pitching
against
the
detroit
club
no
doubt
you
gentlemen
and
officers
has
heard
of
the
famous
hughey
jennings
and
his
eeyah
and
on
the
detroit
club
is
also
the
famous
tyrus
cobb
the
georgia
peach
as
he
is
called
and
i
want
to
pay
him
a
tribute
right
here
and
say
he
is
one
of
the
best
ball
players
in
the
american
league
and
a
great
hitter
if
you
do
pitch
just
right
to
him
one
time
we
was
in
detroit
for
a
serious
of
games
and
we
had
loose
the
first
two
games
do
to
bad
pitching
and
the
first
game
eddie
cicotte
have
nothing
and
the
second
game
faber
was
in
the
same
boat
so
on
this
morning
i
refer
to
manager
rowland
come
up
to
me
in
the
lobby
of
the
tuller
hotel
and
said
how
do
you
feel
jack
and
i
said
clarence
why
do
you
ask
and
he
said
well
we
have
loose
games
here
and
we
have
got
to
grab
this
one
this
and
if
you
feel
i
will
work
you
because
i
know
you
have
got
them
licked
as
soon
as
you
walk
out
there
so
i
said
all
right
clarence
you
can
rely
on
me
and
that
i
give
them
hits
and
shut
them
out
and
cobb
come
up
in
the
ninth
innings
with
two
men
on
bases
and
two
men
out
and
ray
schalk
our
catcher
signed
me
for
a
curve
ball
but
i
shook
my
head
and
give
him
my
floater
and
the
mighty
cobb
hit
that
ball
on
a
line
to
our
right
fielder
eddie
murphy
and
the
game
was
over
this
war
is
a
good
deal
like
baseball
gentlemen
because
it
is
stratejy
that
wins
and
no
matter
how
many
soldiers
a
has
got
he
wo
get
nowheres
without
he
uses
his
brains
and
its
the
same
in
baseball
and
the
boys
that
stays
in
the
big
league
is
the
boys
that
can
think
and
when
this
war
is
over
i
hope
to
go
back
and
begin
where
i
left
off
and
win
a
pennant
for
charley
comiskey
the
old
roman
in
the
american
league
well
al
they
was
a
regular
storm
when
i
got
through
and
i
bowed
and
give
them
a
smile
and
started
off
of
the
platform
but
a
sargent
named
avery
from
our
stopped
me
and
set
me
down
in
a
chair
and
says
i
was
to
wait
a
minute
and
i
thought
of
course
they
was
going
to
give
me
a
cup
or
something
though
i
did
expect
nothing
of
the
kind
but
i
had
no
sooner
set
down
when
sargent
avery
stepped
up
to
the
front
of
the
platform
and
says
gentlemen
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
private
jack
keefe
the
great
stratejest
is
not
only
a
great
pitcher
and
a
great
speech
maker
but
he
is
also
a
great
poet
and
if
you
do
believe
me
i
will
read
you
this
beautiful
valentine
that
he
wrote
to
a
certain
lady
that
we
all
admire
and
who
was
in
the
red
x
canteen
up
till
today
when
she
went
back
to
paris
to
resume
other
dutys
well
before
i
could
make
a
move
he
read
that
crazy
valentine
and
of
course
they
was
a
word
in
it
that
i
was
serious
when
i
wrote
it
and
it
was
all
a
joke
with
me
only
not
exactly
a
joke
neither
because
i
was
really
trying
to
let
the
little
lady
down
easy
and
tell
her
good
by
between
the
lines
without
being
rough
with
it
but
of
course
these
boobs
pretended
like
they
thought
i
meant
it
all
and
was
love
sick
or
something
and
they
hollered
like
a
bunch
of
indians
and
clapped
and
razed
he
ll
well
al
i
did
get
a
chance
to
see
sargent
avery
after
it
was
over
because
he
blowed
right
out
but
i
will
see
him
tomorrow
and
i
will
find
out
from
him
who
stole
that
poem
from
miss
moselle
and
i
would
be
supprised
if
the
reason
she
blowed
to
paris
was
on
acct
of
missing
the
poem
and
figureing
some
big
bum
had
stole
it
off
her
and
they
would
find
out
her
secret
and
make
things
misable
for
her
and
the
chances
is
that
why
she
blowed
well
wait
till

out
who
done
it
and
they
will
be
one
less
snake
in
this
regt

the
sooner

weed
those
kind
of
birds

will
get
somewheres

if
you
do
you
wo
but
the
poor
little
lady
al
i
ca
help
from
feeling
sorry
for
her
and
i
only
wished
i
could
go
to
paris
and
find
her
and
tell
her
to
not
worry
though
of
course
its
best
if
she

but
i
sorry

had
to
come
off
this
way
your
pal
jack
in
france
friend
al
well
al
this
may
be
the
last

i
am
waiting

they
are
going
to
do
with
me
and
i
will
explain
what
i
mean
yesterday
i
seen
sargent
avery
and
i
asked
him
if
i
could
talk
to
him
a
minute
and
he
says
yes
and
i
said
i
wanted
to
find
out
from
him
who
stole
that
valentine
from
miss
moselle
so
he
says
who
is
miss
moselle
so
i
said
why
that
little
lady
in
the
canteen
that
blowed
to
paris
so
he
says
well
that
little
lady
name
is
miss
moselle
but
her
name
is
ruth
palmer
and
she
is
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
richest
birds
in

and
they
was
nobody

i
said

me
she
said

the
same
with
a
poet

about
time
we
was
finding

out
so
she
laughed
and
give
me
the
valentine
and
that
the
whole
story
well
al
i
had
a
frank
note
on
me
and
i
asked
sargent
avery
if
he
would
like
some
champagne
and
he
said
no
he
would
but
that
stop
me
al
and
i
got
all
i
could
hold
onto
and
then
some
and
i
snuck
in
last
night
after
lights
out
and
i
do
know
if
anybody
was
wise
or
not
but
if
they
are
its
libel
to
go
hard
with
me
and
capt
seeley
said
something
about
the
fireing
squad
for
the
next
bird
that
cut
loose
well
i
reported
sick
this
and
they
could
tell
to
look
at
me
that
it
was
no
stall
so
i
here
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
is
gone
and
i
am
waiting
for
them
to
summons
me
before
the
court
marshall
but
listen
al
if
they
do
like
capt
seeley
said
you
can
bet
that
before
they
get
me
i
will
get
some
of
these
birds
that
been
calling
me
private
valentine
ever
since
saturday
night
your
pal
jack
chapter
iii
stragety
and
tragedy
in
france
march
well
al
if
it
rains
a
couple
more
days
like
its
been
they
will
half
to
page
the
navy
and
at
that
its
about
time
they
give
them
something
to
do
and
i
do
mean
the
chasers
and
destroyers
and
etc
that
acts
like
convoys
for
our
troop
ships
and
throws
them
death
bombs
at
the
u
boats
but
i
mean
the
big
battle
ships
and
i
bet
you
have
heard
of
a
supper
dread
doing
nothing
since
we
been
in
the
war
and
they
say
they
ca
do
nothing
till
the
german
navy
comes
out
and
that
what
waiting
for
well
al
that
a
good
deal
like
waiting
for
the
of
or
for
jennings
to
send
his
self
up
to
hit
for
cobb
and
they
can
say
all
they
want
about
the
germans
being
bullet
proof
from
the
neck
up
but
they
got
some
brains
and
you
can
bet
their
navy
ai
comeing
out
no
more
then
my
hair
so
as
far
as
i
can
see
a
man
being
on
a
supper
dread
is
just
like
you
owned
a
private
yatch
without
haveing
to
pay
for
the
keep
up
and
when
they
talk
about
a
man
on
a
big
battle
ship
in
danger
they
mean
he
might
maybe
die
because
he
eat
to
much
and
no
exercise
so
if
i
was
them
i
would
send
the
big
ships
here
so
as
we
could
use
them
for
motor
lauras
and
i
guess
they
no
place
in
our
whole
camp
where
you
could
float
them
and
i
do
know
how
it
is
all
over
france
but
if
they
was
a
baseball
league
between
the
towns
where
they
have
got
us
billeted
the
fans
would
get
blear
eyed
looking
at
the
no
game
sign
and
if
a
mgr
worked
their
pitchers
in
turn
say
it
was
my
turn
tomorrow
and
the
next
time
my
turn
come
around
some
of
little
al
kids
would
half
to
help
me
out
of
the
easy
chair
and
say
come
on
granpa
you
pitch
this
afternoon
jokeing
a
side
al
if
i
was
running
the
training
camps
like
camp
grant
back
home
instead
of
starting
the
men
off
with
the
regular
drills
and
hikes
like
they
give
them
now
i
would
stand
them
under
a
shower
bath
with
their
close
on
about
the
time
and
when
it
come
time
for
a
hike
i
would
send
them
back
and
fourth
across
rock
river
and
back
where
they
was
no
bridge
and
then
maybe
when
they
got
over
here
france
would
be
such
a
big
supprise
one
of
the
boys
has
put
a
sign
up
on
our
billet
and
it
says
noahs
ark
on
it
and
maybe
you
have
heard
that
old
gag
al
about
the
big
flood
that
everybody
was
drownded
only
noah
and
his
folks
and
a
married
couple
of
every
kind
of
animals
in
the
world
and
they
was
drownded
because
noah
had
a
ark
for
them
to
get
in
out
of
the
wet
well
noahs
ark
is
a
good
name
for
our
dump
and
believe
me
they
have
none
of
the
animals
been
overlooked
and
we
are
also
going
noah
one
better
and
sheltering
all
the
bugs
and
some
of
them
is
dressed
in
cocky
well
i
am
in
this
war
to
the
finish
and
you
could
hire
me
to
quit
till
we
have
ran
them
ragged
but
i
wished
they
had
of
gave
us
steel
helmets
wide
enough
so
as
they
would
make
a
bumber
shoot
and
i
hope
the
next
war
they
have
they
will
pick
out
arizona
to
have
it
there
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
al
i
suppose
you
have
read
in
the
communicates
that
comes
out
in
the
paper
where
the
americans
that
all
ready
in
the
trenchs
has
pulled
off
some
great
stuff
and
a
whole
lot
of
them
has
been
sighted
and
give
meddles
and
etc
by
the
frenchmens
for
what
they
have
pulled
off
and
the
way
they
work
it
al
when
one
of
the
soldiers
wrists
his
life
or
something
and
pulls
off
something
big
like
takeing
a
mess
of
prisoners
and
bringing
them
back
here
where
they
can
get
something
to
eat
the
french
pins
a
meddle
on
them
and
sometimes
they
do
it
if
you
do
do
nothing
but
die
only
then
of
course
they
send
it
to
your
family
so
as
they
will
have
something
to
show
their
friends
besides
snapshots
of
city
well
we
was
kidding
back
and
fourth
about
it
today
and
one
of
the
smart
alex
in
our
a
bird
named
johnny
alcock
that
is
always
trying
to
kid
somebody
all
the
time
he
said
to
me
well
i
suppose
they
will
half
to
build
more
tonnages
to
carry
all
the
meddles
you
will
win
back
to
the
states
so
i
said
well
i
guess
i
will
win
as
many
of
them
as
you
will
win
that
shut
him
up
for
a
wile
but
finely
he
says
you
have
got
enough
chest
to
wear
a
whole
junk
shop
on
it
so
i
said
well
i
am
not
the
baby
that
win
them
so
he
says
if
you
ever
happen
to
be
snooping
around
the
bosh
trenchs
when
fritz
climbs
over
the
top
you
will
come
back
so
fast
that
the
kaiser
will
want
to
know
who
was
that
speed
merchant
that
led
the
charge
and
decorate
you
with
a
iron
cross
so
i
said
i
will
decorate
you
right
in
the
eye
one
of
these
days
so
he
had
to
shut
up
and
all
the
other
boys
give
him
the
laugh
well
al
jokeing
to
one
side
if
i
half
to
go
back
home
without
a
meddle
it
will
be
because
they
are
playing
favorites
but
i
guess
i
would
be
left
out
at
that
because
i
stand
ace
high
with
most
of
the
frenchmens
around
here
because
they
like
a
man
that
always
got
a
smile
or
a
kind
word
for
them
and
they
would
like
me
still
better
yet
if
they
could
understand
more
english
and
get
my
stuff
better
but
it
do
seem
like
they
even
try
to
learn
and
i
suppose
its
because
they
figure
the
war
is
in
their
country
so
everybody
should
ought
to
talk
their
language
but
when
you
get
down
to
cases
they
a
big
job
on
both
our
hands
and
if
one
of
us
has
got
to
talk
the
others
language
why
and
the
he
ll
should
they
pick
on
the
one
hard
to
learn
it
and
besides
its
to
i
you
might
say
because
the
and
the
english
uses
the
same
language
and
they
nobody
only
the
french
that
talks
like
they
do
because
they
could
nobody
else
talk
that
way
so
why
would
it
be
the
square
thing
for
them
to
forget
theirs
and
tackle
ours
and
it
would
prolongate
their
lifes
to
do
it
because
most
of
their
words
ca
be
said
without
straining
yourself
and
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
physic
you
got
its
bound
to
wear
you
down
in
time
but
i
suppose
the
french
soldiers
figure
they
have
got
enough
of
a
job
on
their
hands
remembering
their
different
uniforms
and
who
to
salute
and
etc
and
they
have
got
a
fine
system
in
the
french
army
al
because
you
wear
whatever
you
was
before
you
got
to
be
what
you
are
that
is
sometimes
for
inst
suppose
you
use
to
be
in
the
artillery
and
now
you
are
a
aviator
you
still
wear
a
artillery
uniform
part
of
the
time
and
its
like
i
use
to
pitch
for
the
white
sox
and
i
guess
i
would
be
a
pretty
looking
bird
if
i
waddled
around
in
the
mire
here
a
wile
with
my
old
baseball
unie
on
me
and
soon
people
would
begin
to
think
i
was
drafted
from
the
toledo
mud
hens
seriously
al
sometimes
you
see
or
french
officers
comeing
along
and
they
have
one
of
them
got
the
same
color
uniform
on
but
they
are
all
dressed
up
like
a
roman
candle
you
might
say
and
if
their
uniforms
run
when
they
got
wet
a
man
could
let
them
drip
into
a
pail
and
drink
it
up
for
a
pussy
cafe
well
al
the
boys
in
our
regt
is
going
to
get
out
a
newspaper
and
get
it
out
themself
and
it
will
be
just
the
news
about
our
regt
and
a
few
gags
and
comical
storys
about
the
different
boys
and
they
are
going
to
get
it
out
once
per
wk
pierson
from
our
that
use
to
work
on
a
newspaper
somewheres
is
going
to
be
the
editor
and
he
wants
i
should
write
them
up
something
about
baseball
and
how
to
pitch
and
etc
but
i
do
believe
in
a
man
waisting
their
time
on
a
childs
play
like
writeing
up
articles
for
a
newspaper
but
just
to
stall
him
i
said
i
would
try
and
think
up
something
and
give
it
to
him
when
i
had
it
wrote
up
well
him
waiting
for
my
article
will
be
like
me
waiting
for
mail
because
i
do
want
nobody
to
take
me
for
a
newspaper
man
because
i
seen
enough
of
them
in
baseball
and
one
time
we
was
playing
in
phila
and
i
had
them
shut
out
up
to
the
inning
and
all
of
a
sudden
weaver
and
collins
got
a
stroke
of
paralysis
and
tipped
their
caps
to
a
couple
ground
balls
that
grazed
their
shoe
laces
and
then
rube
oldring
hit
one
on
a
line
right
at
gandil
and
he
tried
to
catch
it
on
the
bounce
off
his
lap
and
bill
dinneen
right
arm
was
lame
and
he
begin
calling
everything
a
ball
and
first
thing
you
know
they
beat
us
to
or
something
and
robbins
one
of
the
chi
paper
reporters
that
traveled
with
us
wired
a
telegram
home
to
his
paper
that
phila
was
supposed
to
be
a
town
where
a
man
could
get
plenty
of
sleep
but
i
looked
like
i
had
set
up
all
the
nights
we
was
there
and
of
course
florrie
seen
it
in
the
paper
and
got
delirious
and
i
would
of
busted
robbins
in
the
jaw
only
i
was
sure
if
he
realy
wrote
it
that
way
or
the
telegraph
operator
might
of
balled
it
up
so
they
wo
be
no
newspaper
articles
in
mine
al
but
i
will
be
anxious
to
see
what
pierson
paper
looks
like
when
it
comes
out
and
i
bet
it
will
be
a
fine
paper
if
our
bunch
have
the
writeing
of
it
because
the
most
of
them
would
drop
in
a
swoon
if
you
asked
them
how
to
spell
their
name
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
al
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
about
them
getting
up
a
newspaper
in
our
regt
and
joe
pierson
asked
me
would
i
write
them
up
something
for
it
and
i
told
him
no
i
would
but
it
seems
like
he
overheard
me
and
thought
i
said
i
would
so
any
way
he
was
expecting
something
from
me
so
last
night
i
wrote
them
up
something
and
i
do
know
if
the
paper
will
ever
get
printed
or
not
so
i
will
coppy
down
a
part
of
what
i
wrote
to
give
you
a
idear
of
what
i
wrote
he
wanted
i
should
write
them
up
something
about
the
stragety
of
baseball
and
where
it
was
like
the
stragety
in
the
war
because
one
night
last
month
i
give
them
a
little
talk
at
one
of
their
entertainments
about
how
the
man
that
used
their
brains
in
baseball
was
the
one
that
win
just
like
in
the
army
but
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
about
me
giveing
them
that
little
talk
and
afterwards
i
got
a
skinfull
of
the
old
grape
and
i
thought
sure
they
would
have
me
up
in
front
of
the
old
court
marshall
but
they
never
knowed
the
difference
on
acct
of
the
way
i
can
handle
it
and
you
take
the
most
of
the
boys
and
if
they
see
a
cork
they
want
to
kiss
the
colonel
well
any
way
here
is
the
article
i
wrote
up
and
i
called
it
war
and
baseball
games
where
brains
wins
the
public
that
go
out
to
the
baseball
park
and
set
through
the
games
probably
think
they
see
everything
that
is
going
on
on
the
field
but
a
lot
of
stuff
that
goes
on
on
the
baseball
field
that
the
public
do
see
and
do
know
nothing
about
and
i
refer
to
what
we
baseball
boys
calls
inside
baseball
no
one
is
in
a
better
position
to
know
all
about
inside
baseball
then
a
man
like
i
who
have
been
a
pitcher
in
the
big
league
because
it
is
the
pitchers
that
has
to
do
most
of
the
thinking
and
pull
off
the
smart
plays
that
is
what
wins
ball
games
for
inst
i
will
write
down
about
a
little
incidents
that
come
off
one
time
yrs
ago
when
the
boston
club
was
playing
against
the
chicago
white
sox
where
i
was
one
of
the
stars
when
the
went
into
the
war
and
then
i
dropped
baseball
and
signed
up
a
contract
with
uncle
sam
to
play
for
my
country
in
the
big
game
against
the
kaiser
of
germany
this
day
i
refer
to
i
was
in
there
giveing
them
the
best
i
had
but
we
was
in
a
tight
game
because
the
boys
was
not
hitting
behind
me
though
carl
mays
that
was
pitching
for
the
boston
club
did
have
nothing
on
the
ball
only
the
cover
and
after
the
ball
left
his
hand
you
could
have
ran
in
the
club
house
and
changed
your
undershirt
and
still
be
back
in
time
to
swing
when
the
ball
got
up
there
well
it
come
along
the
inning
and
we
was
tied
up
with
the
score
and
and
i
had
larry
gardner
swinging
like
a
hammock
all
day
but
this
time
he
hit
a
fly
ball
that
either
weaver
or
jackson
ought
to
of
caught
in
a
hollow
tooth
but
they
both
layed
down
and
died
on
it
and
gardner
got
on
second
base
well
they
was
men
out
and
hoblitzel
was
the
next
man
up
and
the
next
man
after
he
was
scott
their
shortstop
that
could
take
the
ball
in
his
hand
and
make
a
base
hit
off
a
man
like
i
so
instead
of
me
giveing
hobby
a
ball
to
hit
i
walked
him
as
we
call
it
and
then
of
course
it
was
scott
turn
to
bat
and
barry
their
mgr
hesitated
if
he
should
send
ruth
up
to
hit
for
scott
or
not
but
finely
he
left
scott
go
up
there
and
he
was
just
dragging
his
bat
off
his
shoulder
to
swing
at
the
first
strike
when
i
whizzed
the
third
one
past
him
that
is
what
we
call
inside
baseball
or
stragety
whether
its
in
baseball
or
war
is
walking
a
man
like
hoblitzel
that
might
be
lucky
enough
to
hit
one
somewheres
but
if
you
do
give
him
nothing
to
hit
how
can
he
hit
it
and
then
i
made
scott
look
like
he
had
been
sent
for
but
could
come
afterwards
in
the
inning
duffy
lewis
hit
a
ball
that
he
ought
to
of
been
traded
for
even
swinging
at
it
because
it
come
near
clipping
his
ear
lob
but
any
way
he
swang
at
it
and
hit
it
for
three
bases
because
jackson
layed
down
and
died
going
after
it
and
lewis
scored
on
a
past
ball
and
they
beat
us
to
so
that
is
what
we
call
stragety
on
the
baseball
field
and
it
wins
there
the
same
like
in
war
and
this
war
will
be
win
by
the
side
that
has
gens
with
brains
and
use
them
and
i
figure
where
a
man
that
has
been
in
big
league
baseball
where
you
ca
never
make
a
success
out
of
it
unless
you
are
a
quick
thinker
and
they
have
got
a
big
advantage
over
men
that
been
in
other
walks
of
life
where
its
most
all
luck
and
i
figure
the
army
would
be
a
whole
lot
better
off
if
all
the
officers
and
gens
had
of
played
baseball
in
the
big
leagues
and
learned
to
think
quick
but
of
course
they
ai
everybody
that
have
got
the
ability
to
play
baseball
and
stand
the
gaff
but
the
man
that
has
got
the
ability
and
been
through
the
ropes
is
just
that
much
ahead
of
the
rest
of
them
and
its
to
bad
that
most
of
our
gens
is
so
old
that
they
could
of
knew
much
about
baseball
since
it
become
a
test
of
brains
like
it
is
now
i
am
afraid
i
have
eat
up
a
lot
of
space
with
my
little
article
on
war
and
baseball
so
i
will
end
this
little
article
up
with
a
little
comical
incidents
that
happened
dureing
our
training
trip
down
in
mineral
wells
tex
a
year
ago
this
spring
the
first
day
we
was
out
for
practice
they
was
a
young
outfielder
from
a
bush
league
and
mgr
rowland
told
him
to
go
out
in
right
field
and
shag
and
this
was
his
reply
have
never
been
in
this
park
before
so
you
will
half
to
tell
me
which
is
right
field
of
course
right
field
is
the
same
field
in
all
parks
and
that
is
what
made
the
incidents
so
comical
and
some
of
the
boys
is
certainly
green
when
they
first
break
in
and
we
have
manys
the
laugh
at
their
expense
that
is
what
i
wrote
up
for
them
al
and
i
wound
it
up
with
that
little
story
and
i
was
reading
over
what
i
wrote
and
johnny
alcock
seen
me
reading
it
and
asked
me
to
leave
him
see
it
so
i
showed
it
to
him
and
he
said
it
was
great
stuff
and
he
had
never
dreamt
they
was
that
much
stragety
in
baseball
and
he
thought
if
some
of
the
officers
seen
it
they
would
pop
their
eyes
out
and
they
would
want
to
talk
to
me
and
get
my
idears
and
see
if
maybe
they
could
some
of
them
be
plied
to
war
fair
and
maybe
if
i
showed
them
where
it
could
i
would
get
promoted
and
stuck
on
to
the
staff
that
all
made
up
from
gens
that
lays
out
the
attacks
and
etc
well
al
alcock
is
a
pretty
wise
bird
and
a
fine
boy
to
if
you
know
how
to
take
him
and
he
seen
right
off
what
i
was
getting
at
in
my
article
and
its
true
al
that
the
games
is
like
the
other
and
quick
thinking
is
what
wins
in
both
of
them
but
i
am
not
looking
for
no
staff
job
that
you
half
to
go
up
in
the
trenchs
and
fight
but
just
lay
around
in
some
office
somewheres
and
stick
pins
in
a
map
while
the
rest
of
the
boys
is
sticking
bayonets
in
the
dutchmen
maps
so
i
hope
they
do
none
of
the
gens
see
what
i
wrote
because
i
come
over
here
to
fight
and
be
a
soldier
and
carry
a
riffle
instead
of
a
pin
cushion
but
it
do
hurt
nothing
for
me
to
give
them
a
few
hints
once
in
a
wile
about
useing
their
brains
if
they
have
got
them
and
if
i
can
do
any
good
with
my
articles
in
the
papers
why
i
would
just
as
leaf
wear
my
fingers
to
the
bone
writeing
them
up
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
al
i
bet
you
will
pretty
near
fall
over
in
a
swoon
when
you
read
what
i
have
got
to
tell
you
before
you
get
this
letter
you
will
probably
all
ready
of
got
a
coppy
of
the
paper
i
told
you
about
because
it
come
out
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
sent
you
a
coppy
with
my
article
in
it
only
they
cut
a
part
of
it
out
on
acct
of
not
haveing
enough
space
for
all
of
it
but
they
left
the
best
part
of
it
in
well
al
somebody
must
of
a
sent
a
coppy
to
pershing
and
marked
up
what
i
wrote
up
so
as
he
would
be
sure
and
see
it
and
probably
one
of
the
officers
done
it
well
that
either
here
or
there
but
this
afternoon
when
we
come
in
they
was
a
letter
for
me
and
who
do
you
think
it
was
from
al
well
you
ca
never
even
begin
to
guess
so
i
will
tell
you
it
was
from
pershing
al
and
it
come
from
paris
where
he
is
at
and
i
have
got
it
here
laying
on
the
table
and
i
would
send
it
to
you
to
look
at
only
i
would
take
no
chances
of
looseing
it
and
i
do
mean
you
would
be
carefull
of
it
al
but
of
course
the
mail
has
got
to
go
across
the
old
pond
and
if
the
dutchmens
periscoped
the
boat
the
letter
was
on
it
it
would
be
good
night
letter
and
a
letter
like
this
here
is
something
to
be
proud
of
and
hold
onto
it
and
keep
it
for
little
al
till
he
grows
up
big
enough
to
appreciate
it
but
they
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
copping
down
the
letter
so
as
you
can
read
what
it
says
and
here
it
is
private
keefe
my
attention
was
called
today
to
an
article
written
by
you
in
your
regimental
paper
under
the
title
war
and
baseball
two
games
where
brains
wins
in
this
article
you
state
that
our
generals
would
be
better
able
to
accomplish
their
task
if
they
had
enjoyed
the
benefits
of
strategic
training
in
baseball
i
have
always
been
a
great
admirer
of
the
national
game
of
baseball
and
i
heartily
agree
with
what
you
say
but
unfortunately
only
a
few
of
us
ever
possessed
the
ability
to
play
your
game
and
the
few
never
were
proficient
enough
to
play
it
professionally
therefore
the
general
staff
is
obliged
to
blunder
along
without
that
capacity
for
quick
thinking
which
is
acquired
only
on
the
baseball
field
but
i
believe
in
making
use
of
all
the
talent
in
my
army
even
among
the
rank
and
file
therefore
i
respectfully
ask
whether
you
think
some
of
your
baseball
secrets
would
be
of
strategic
value
to
us
in
the
prosecution
of
this
war
and
if
so
whether
you
would
be
willing
to
provide
us
with
the
same
if
it
is
not
too
much
trouble
i
would
be
pleased
to
hear
from
you
along
these
lines
and
if
you
have
any
suggestion
to
make
regarding
a
campaign
against
our
enemy
either
offensive
or
defensive
i
would
be
pleased
to
have
you
outline
it
in
a
letter
to
me
by
the
way
i
note
with
pleasure
that
our
first
names
are
the
same
it
makes
a
sort
of
bond
between
us
which
i
trust
will
be
further
cemented
if
you
can
be
of
assistance
to
me
in
my
task
i
shall
eagerly
await
your
reply
sincerely
black
jack
pershing
folies
bergere
paris
france
that
is
the
letter
i
got
from
him
al
and
i
say
its
some
letter
and
i
bet
if
some
of
these
smart
alex
officers
seen
it
it
would
reduce
some
of
the
swelling
in
their
chest
but
i
consider
the
letter
confidential
al
and
i
have
showed
it
to
nobody
only
or
of
my
buddys
and
i
showed
it
to
johnny
alcock
and
he
popped
his
eyes
out
so
far
you
could
of
snipped
them
off
with
a
shears
and
he
said
it
was
a
cinch
that
pershing
realy
wrote
it
on
acct
of
him
signing
it
black
jack
pershing
and
they
would
nobody
else
sign
it
that
way
because
it
was
a
private
nickname
between
he
and
some
of
his
friends
and
they
would
nobody
else
know
about
it
so
then
he
asked
was
i
going
to
answer
the
letter
and
i
said
of
course
i
was
and
he
says
well
i
better
take
a
whole
lot
of
pains
with
my
answer
and
study
up
the
situation
before
i
wrote
it
and
put
some
good
idears
in
it
and
if
my
letters
made
a
hit
with
pershing
the
next
thing
you
know
he
would
probably
summons
me
to
paris
and
maybe
stick
me
on
the
war
board
so
as
all
i
would
half
to
do
would
be
figure
up
plans
of
attacks
and
etc
and
not
half
to
go
up
in
the
trenchs
and
wrist
my
life
and
probably
get
splattered
all
over
france
so
i
said
well
i
am
not
looking
for
no
excuse
to
get
out
of
the
trenchs
but
its
just
the
other
way
and
i
am
nuts
to
get
in
them
so
he
says
you
must
be
but
he
showed
me
where
it
would
be
a
great
experience
to
set
in
at
them
meetings
even
if
i
did
have
much
to
say
and
just
set
there
and
listen
and
hear
their
plans
and
what
comeing
off
and
besides
i
would
get
a
chance
to
see
something
of
paris
and
it
do
look
like
none
of
us
only
the
officers
would
be
give
leave
to
go
there
but
of
course
i
would
go
if
black
jack
wanted
me
and
after
all
al
i
am
here
to
give
uncle
sam
the
best
i
have
got
and
if
i
can
serve
the
stars
and
strips
better
by
sticking
pins
in
a
map
then
getting
in
the
trenchs
why
all
right
and
it
takes
more
than
common
soldiers
to
win
a
war
and
if
i
am
more
use
to
them
as
a
kind
of
adviser
instead
of
carrying
a
bayonet
why
i
will
sacrifice
my
own
feelings
for
the
good
of
the
cause
like
i
often
done
in
baseball
but
they
another
thing
alcock
told
me
al
and
that
is
that
the
war
board
they
have
got
has
got
gens
on
it
from
all
the
different
countrys
like
the
and
england
and
france
and
spain
and
of
course
they
are
more
french
gens
than
anything
else
on
acct
of
the
war
being
here
in
france
so
probably
they
do
some
of
their
talking
in
french
and
alcock
says
if
he
was
i
he
would
get
busy
and
try
and
learn
enough
french
so
as
i
could
make
myself
understood
when
i
had
something
to
say
and
of
course
they
probably
wo
nothing
come
out
of
it
all
but
still
and
all
i
always
says
its
best
to
be
ready
for
whatever
comes
off
and
if
the
had
of
been
ready
for
this
war
i
would
be
setting
here
writeing
this
letter
now
but
i
would
be
takeing
a
plunge
in
one
of
them
berlin
brewry
vats
any
way
i
have
all
ready
picked
enough
french
so
as
i
can
talk
it
pretty
good
and
i
would
be
if
i
could
understand
it
when
they
are
talking
it
off
but
to
hear
them
talk
it
off
you
would
think
they
seen
their
dinner
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
well
al
i
will
tell
you
how
things
comes
out
and
i
hope
black
jack
will
forget
all
about
it
and
lay
off
me
so
as
i
can
get
into
the
real
fighting
instead
of
standing
in
front
of
a
map
all
the
wile
like
a
school
teacher
or
something
and
i
all
most
wished
i
had
never
wrote
that
article
and
then
of
course
the
idear
would
of
never
came
to
black
jack
that
i
could
help
him
but
if
he
does
take
me
on
his
staff
it
will
be
some
pair
of
jacks
eh
al
and
enough
to
open
the
pot
and
if
the
germans
is
sucker
enough
to
stay
in
they
will
get
their
whiskers
cinched
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
this
is
the
second
letter
i
have
wrote
today
and
the
other
one
is
to
pershing
and
i
have
still
got
the
letter
here
yet
al
and
i
will
coppy
it
down
and
tell
you
what
i
wrote
to
him
jack
pershing
care
folies
bergere
paris
france
you
can
bet
i
was
supprised
to
get
a
letter
from
you
and
when
i
wrote
that
article
i
did
have
no
idear
that
they
would
something
come
out
of
it
well
gen
i
come
into
the
army
expecting
to
fight
and
lay
down
my
life
if
nessary
and
i
am
not
one
of
the
kind
that
are
looking
for
an
out
and
trying
to
hide
behind
a
desk
or
something
because
i
am
afraid
to
go
into
the
trenchs
but
i
guess
if
you
know
something
about
baseball
you
wo
accuse
me
from
not
having
the
old
nerve
because
they
ca
no
man
hold
onto
a
job
in
the
big
leagues
unless
a
man
is
fearless
and
does
their
best
work
under
fire
and
especially
a
pitcher
but
if
you
figure
that
i
can
serve
old
glory
better
some
other
way
then
in
the
rank
and
files
i
am
willing
to
sacrifice
myself
like
i
often
done
in
baseball
anything
to
win
is
the
way
i
look
at
it
you
asked
me
in
your
letter
did
i
think
some
of
my
idears
would
help
out
well
a
man
do
like
to
sound
like
they
was
bragging
themself
up
but
this
is
no
time
for
monking
and
i
guess
you
want
the
truth
well
gen
i
do
know
much
about
running
a
army
and
their
plans
but
stragety
is
the
same
if
its
on
the
battle
field
or
the
baseball
diamond
you
might
say
and
it
just
means
how
can
we
beat
them
and
i
often
say
that
the
men
that
can
use
their
brains
will
win
any
kind
of
a
game
except
maybe
some
college
willy
boy
game
like
football
or
bridge
whist
well
without
no
bragging
myself
up
i
learned
a
whole
lot
about
stragety
on
the
baseball
field
and
i
think
i
could
help
you
in
a
good
many
ways
but
before
i
tried
to
tell
you
how
to
do
something
i
would
half
to
know
what
you
was
trying
to
do
and
of
course
i
know
you
ca
tell
me
in
a
letter
on
acct
of
the
censors
and
of
course
they
are
americans
to
but
they
a
whole
lot
of
the
boys
that
do
mean
no
harm
but
they
are
gabby
and
ca
keep
their
mouth
shut
and
who
knows
who
would
get
a
hold
of
it
and
for
the
same
reason
i
do
feel
like
i
should
give
you
any
of
my
idears
by
mail
but
if
i
could
just
see
you
and
we
could
have
a
little
talk
and
talk
things
over
but
i
do
suppose
they
any
chance
of
that
unless
i
could
get
leave
off
to
run
down
to
paris
for
a
wile
and
meet
you
somewheres
but
they
wo
give
us
no
leave
to
go
to
paris
but
of
course
a
letter
from
you
that
i
could
show
it
to
capt
seeley
would
fix
it
up
and
no
questions
asked
so
i
guess
i
better
wait
till
i
hear
from
you
along
these
lines
and
in
the
mean
wile
i
will
be
thinking
the
situation
over
and
see
what
i
can
think
up
and
i
all
ready
got
some
idears
that
i
feel
like
they
would
work
out
and
i
hope
i
will
get
a
chance
in
the
near
future
to
have
a
little
chat
with
you
i
note
what
you
say
about
our
name
being
both
jack
and
i
was
thinking
to
myself
that
lots
of
times
in
a
poker
game
a
pair
of
jacks
is
enough
to
win
and
maybe
it
will
be
the
same
way
in
the
war
game
and
any
way
i
guess
the
of
us
could
put
up
a
good
bluff
and
bet
them
just
as
if
we
had
them
eh
gen
respy
jack
keefe
that
what
i
wrote
to
him
al
and
he
will
get
it
some
time
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
and
i
should
ought
to
hear
from
him
back
right
away
and
i
hope
he
will
take
my
hint
and
leave
me
stay
here
with
my
regt
where
i
can
see
some
real
action
but
if
he
summonses
me
i
will
go
al
and
not
whine
about
getting
a
raw
deal
well
i
happened
to
drop
into
a
estaminet
here
yesterday
and
that
kind
of
a
store
where
a
man
can
buy
stuff
to
take
along
with
him
or
you
can
get
a
cup
of
coffee
or
pretty
near
anything
and
they
was
a
girl
on
the
job
in
there
and
she
smiled
when
i
come
in
and
i
smiled
at
her
back
and
she
seen
i
was
american
so
she
begin
talking
to
me
in
english
only
she
has
got
some
brogue
and
its
hard
to
make
it
out
what
she
is
trying
to
get
at
well
we
talked
a
wile
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
idear
come
to
me
that
i
and
her
could
hit
it
off
and
both
do
the
other
some
good
by
her
learning
me
french
and
i
could
learn
her
english
and
so
i
sprung
it
on
her
and
she
was
tickled
to
death
and
we
called
it
a
bargain
and
tomorrow
we
are
going
to
have
our
first
lessons
and
how
is
that
al
for
a
bargain
when
i
can
pick
up
french
without
it
costing
me
a
nickle
and
of
course
they
wo
be
only
time
for
i
or
lessons
before
i
hear
from
black
jack
but
i
can
learn
a
whole
lot
in
lessons
if
she
will
tend
to
business
but
the
way
she
smiled
at
me
when
i
come
out
and
the
looks
she
give
me
i
am
afraid
if
she
seen
much
of
me
it
would
be
good
night
so
i
will
half
to
show
her
i
wo
stand
for
no
foolishness
because
i
had
enough
flirtations
al
and
the
next
woman
that
looks
x
eyed
at
me
will
catch
her
death
of
cold
your
pal
jack
illustration
she
smiled
when
i
came
in
and
i
smiled
back
at
her
back
in
france
march
friend
al
well
old
pal
it
looks
like
they
would
be
no
front
line
trenchs
for
this
baby
and
what
i
am
getting
at
is
that
the
word
was
past
around
today
that
black
jack
himself
is
comeing
and
they
is
no
faulse
alarm
about
it
because
capt
seeley
told
us
himself
and
said
pershing
would
be
here
in
a
day
or
to
overlook
us
and
he
wanted
that
everybody
should
look
their
best
and
keep
themself
looking
neat
and
clean
and
clean
up
all
the
billets
and
etc
because
that
was
what
pershing
was
comeing
to
see
how
we
look
and
how
we
are
getting
along
and
etc
well
al
that
what
capt
seeley
said
but
between
you
and
i
they
another
reason
why
he
is
comeing
and
i
guess
he
figures
they
will
be
a
better
chance
to
talk
things
over
down
here
then
if
i
was
to
go
to
paris
and
i
am
not
the
only
one
that
knows
why
he
is
comeing
because
after
supper
alcock
called
me
over
to
i
side
and
congratulated
me
and
said
it
looked
like
i
was
in
soft
well
i
will
be
ready
for
him
when
he
comes
and
i
will
be
ready
to
pack
up
and
blow
out
of
here
at
a
minute
notice
and
i
ca
help
from
wondring
what
some
of
these
smart
alex
officers
will
say
when
they
see
comeing
off
so
this
wo
be
only
a
short
letter
al
because
i
have
got
a
lot
to
do
to
get
ready
and
what
i
am
going
to
do
is
write
down
some
of
my
idears
so
as
i
can
read
them
off
to
him
when
he
comes
and
if
i
did
have
them
wrote
down
i
might
maybe
get
nervous
when
i
seen
him
and
maybe
forget
what
i
got
to
say
because
the
boys
says
he
a
tough
bird
for
a
man
to
see
for
the
first
time
till
you
get
to
know
him
and
he
acts
like
he
was
going
to
eat
you
alive
but
he
a
whole
lot
like
a
dog
when
you
get
to
know
him
and
his
bark
is
worse
then
a
bite
well
al
how
is
that
for
news
and
i
guess
you
will
be
prouder
then
ever
of
your
old
pal
before
this
business
gets
over
with
and
i
would
feel
pretty
good
with
everything
breaking
so
good
only
i
am
getting
worred
about
ernestine
that
little
french
gal
in
the
estaminet
and
i
wished
now
i
never
seen
her
or
made
no
bargain
with
her
and
i
did
do
it
so
much
for
what
i
could
learn
off
of
her
but
these
french
gals
al
has
had
a
tough
time
of
it
and
if
a
man
can
bring
a
little
sunshine
into
their
life
he
be
a
man
unless
he
done
it
so
i
was
just
trying
to
be
a
good
fellow
and
here
is
what
i
get
for
it
because
i
caught
her
today
al
with
that
look
in
her
eye
that
i
seen
in
so
many
of
them
and
i
know
what
it
means
and
i
guess
about
the
best
thing
for
me
to
do
is
run
away
from
pershing
and
go
over
the
top
or
something
and
leave
the
boshs
shoot
my
nose
off
or
mess
me
up
some
way
and
then
maybe
i
wo
get
pestered
to
death
every
time
i
try
and
be
kind
to
some
little
gal
i
guess
the
french
lessons
will
half
to
be
cut
out
because
it
would
be
square
to
leave
her
see
me
again
and
it
would
be
different
if
i
could
tell
her
i
am
married
but
i
do
know
the
french
terms
for
it
and
besides
it
do
seem
to
make
no
difference
to
some
of
them
and
the
way
they
act
you
would
think
a
wife
was
just
something
that
come
out
on
you
like
a
sty
and
the
best
way
to
do
was
just
to
forget
it
well
al
as
i
say
i
caught
her
looking
at
me
like
it
was
breaking
her
heart
and
i
would
be
supprised
if
she
cried
after
i
come
away
but
what
can
a
man
do
about
it
al
and
i
have
got
a
good
notion
to
wear
my
gas
mask
everywhere
i
go
and
then
maybe
i
will
have
a
little
peace
once
in
a
wile
i
must
close
now
for
this
time
and
get
busy
on
some
idears
so
as
black
jack
wo
catch
me
flat
footed
but
i
guess
they
no
danger
of
that
eh
al
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
old
pal
i
am
all
set
for
pershing
when
he
comes
and
i
have
got
some
of
my
idears
wrote
down
just
the
bear
outlines
of
them
and
when
he
asks
me
if
i
have
got
any
i
can
just
read
them
off
from
my
notes
like
i
was
a
lecture
and
here
is
a
few
of
the
notes
i
have
got
wrote
down
so
you
can
get
some
idear
of
what
i
am
going
to
spring
on
him
in
baseball
many
big
league
mgrs
before
a
game
they
talk
it
over
in
the
club
house
with
their
men
and
disgust
the
weakness
of
the
other
club
and
how
is
the
best
way
to
beat
them
and
etc
for
inst
when
i
was
pitching
for
the
white
sox
and
suppose
we
was
going
to
face
a
pitcher
that
maybe
he
was
weak
on
fielding
bunts
so
before
the
game
mgr
rowland
would
say
to
us
remember
boys
this
baby
so
and
so
gets
the
rabbis
if
you
lay
down
bunts
on
him
so
we
would
begin
laying
them
down
on
him
and
the
first
thing
you
know
he
would
be
frothing
at
the
mouth
and
triping
all
over
himself
and
maybe
if
he
did
finely
get
a
hold
of
the
ball
he
would
throw
it
into
the
southren
league
or
somewheres
and
before
the
other
mgr
could
get
another
bird
warmed
up
they
would
half
to
hire
a
crossing
policeman
to
straiten
out
the
jam
at
the
plate
and
the
same
thing
would
be
in
war
like
in
baseball
and
instead
of
a
army
going
into
it
blind
you
might
say
why
the
gens
ought
to
get
together
before
the
battle
and
fix
it
up
to
work
on
the
other
side
weakness
for
inst
suppose
the
germans
is
weak
on
getting
out
of
the
way
of
riffle
bullets
why
that
the
weapon
to
use
on
them
and
make
a
sucker
out
of
them
getting
the
jump
on
your
oppts
is
more
then
the
battle
whether
its
in
the
war
or
on
the
baseball
field
and
many
a
game
has
been
win
by
getting
the
jump
on
your
oppts
for
inst
that
reminds
me
of
a
little
incidents
that
happened
one
day
when
we
was
playing
the
washington
club
and
i
was
pitching
against
the
notorious
walter
johnson
and
before
they
was
a
man
out
geo
mcbride
booted
one
and
collins
and
jackson
got
a
couple
hits
and
we
was
runs
to
the
good
before
they
was
a
man
out
well
johnson
come
back
pretty
good
and
the
rest
of
the
game
the
boys
acted
like
they
was
scared
of
him
and
kept
one
foot
in
the
water
bucket
but
we
would
of
win
the
game
at
that
only
in
the
inning
schalk
dropped
a
third
strike
on
me
and
judge
and
milan
hit
a
couple
of
fly
balls
that
would
of
been
easy
outs
only
for
the
wind
but
the
wind
raised
havioc
with
the
ball
and
they
both
went
for
hits
and
they
beat
us
to
and
that
the
kind
of
luck
i
genally
always
had
against
the
washington
club
in
baseball
of
course
they
only
nine
men
on
a
side
and
that
is
where
a
in
the
war
has
got
the
advantage
on
a
mgr
in
baseball
because
no
rules
in
war
fair
to
keep
a
man
from
useing
all
the
men
he
feels
like
so
it
looks
to
me
like
a
had
all
the
best
of
it
because
suppose
the
other
side
only
had
say
thousand
men
in
a
certain
section
they
nothing
to
prevent
a
from
going
after
them
with
a
thousand
men
and
if
he
ca
run
them
ragged
when
you
got
to
them
to
i
its
time
to
enlist
in
the
all
though
as
i
say
a
mgr
ca
only
use
nine
men
at
a
time
in
baseball
but
at
that
i
know
of
incidents
where
a
mgr
has
took
advantage
of
the
oppts
being
shy
of
men
and
one
time
the
louis
club
came
to
chi
and
jones
was
all
crippled
up
for
pitchers
but
the
game
was
on
our
home
grounds
so
it
was
up
to
mgr
rowland
to
say
if
the
game
should
be
played
or
if
he
should
call
it
off
on
acct
of
cold
weather
because
it
was
in
the
spring
but
he
knowed
jones
was
shy
of
pitchers
so
he
made
him
play
the
game
and
jones
used
big
laudermilk
to
pitch
against
us
and
they
beat
us
and
another
advantage
where
a
got
it
on
a
baseball
mgr
because
in
baseball
the
game
begins
at
and
the
other
club
knows
when
its
going
to
begin
just
the
same
as
your
club
so
they
ca
neither
club
beat
the
other
one
to
it
and
start
the
game
wile
the
other
club
is
looking
out
the
window
but
a
do
half
to
tell
the
other
side
when
he
is
going
to
attack
them
but
of
course
they
have
observers
that
can
see
when
you
are
going
to
get
ready
to
pull
something
but
it
looks
to
me
like
the
observers
be
worth
a
hoop
and
he
ll
if
the
other
made
his
preparations
at
night
when
it
was
dark
like
bringing
up
the
troops
and
artilery
and
supplys
and
etc
and
in
that
way
you
could
take
them
by
supprise
and
make
them
look
like
a
fool
like
in
baseball
i
have
often
crossed
the
batter
up
and
one
day
i
had
cobb
and
and
he
was
all
set
to
murder
a
fast
one
and
i
dinked
a
slow
one
up
there
to
him
and
the
lucky
stiff
hit
it
on
the
end
of
his
bat
just
inside
third
base
and
men
scored
on
it
that
about
the
idears
i
am
going
to
give
him
al
only
of
course
i
can
talk
it
off
better
then
i
can
write
it
because
wile
i
am
talking
i
can
think
up
a
lot
more
incidents
to
tell
him
and
him
being
a
baseball
fan
he
will
set
there
pop
eyed
with
his
mouth
open
as
long
as
i
want
to
talk
but
now
i
ca
hardly
wait
for
him
to
get
here
al
and
it
seems
funny
to
think
that
here
i
am
a
dollar
a
mo
doughboy
and
maybe
in
a
few
days
i
will
be
on
the
staff
and
they
do
have
nobody
only
officers
and
even
a
lieut
gets
or
times
as
much
as
a
doughboy
and
how
is
that
for
a
fine
nickname
al
for
men
that
all
the
dough
they
are
getting
is
a
per
day
and
the
pollutes
only
gets
sues
a
day
and
that
about
cents
so
i
suppose
we
ought
to
call
them
the
wall
crowd
well
al
you
should
ought
to
be
thankfull
you
are
there
at
home
with
your
wife
where
you
can
watch
her
and
keep
your
eyes
on
her
and
find
out
what
she
is
doing
with
her
spare
time
though
i
guess
at
that
they
would
be
much
danger
of
old
bertha
running
a
muck
and
i
do
suppose
she
would
half
to
wear
bob
wire
entanglements
to
keep
jack
the
kisser
away
but
when
a
man
has
got
a
wife
like
florrie
and
here
i
am
over
here
and
there
she
is
over
there
well
al
a
man
do
get
to
sleep
no
quicker
nights
from
thinking
about
it
and
i
lay
there
night
after
night
and
wonder
what
and
the
he
ll
can
she
be
doing
and
she
might
be
doing
most
anything
al
and
they
only
the
one
thing
that
its
a
cinch
she
ai
doing
and
that
writeing
a
letter
to
me
and
a
man
would
pretty
near
think
she
had
forgot
my
first
name
but
even
at
that
she
could
set
down
and
write
to
me
and
start
it
out
dear
husband
but
the
way
she
acts
why
even
if
they
was
any
fun
over
here
i
would
be
haveing
it
and
suppose
i
do
get
on
pershing
staff
and
get
a
lieut
or
something
and
write
and
tell
her
about
it
why
she
would
probably
wait
till
a
legal
holiday
to
answer
me
back
and
then
she
would
write
about
words
and
say
she
went
to
the
palace
last
week
and
when
she
come
out
after
the
show
it
was
raining
well
al
you
ca
blame
a
man
for
anything
he
pulls
off
when
their
wife
acts
like
that
and
if
i
give
that
little
ernestine
a
smack
the
next
time
she
bulges
her
lips
out
at
me
whose
fault
is
it
al
not
mine
your
pal
jack
in
france
march
friend
al
well
al
the
sooner
the
germans
starts
their
drive
let
them
come
and
i
only
hope
we
are
up
there
when
they
start
it
and
believe
me
al
if
they
come
at
us
with
the
gas
i
will
dive
into
it
with
my
mouth
wide
open
and
see
how
much
of
it
i
can
get
because
they
no
use
al
of
a
man
trying
to
live
with
the
kind
of
luck
i
have
got
and
i
sick
in
tired
of
it
all
wait
till
you
hear
what
come
off
today
al
in
the
first
place
my
been
going
back
on
me
for
a
long
wile
and
they
walked
us
all
over
france
yesterday
and
this
i
could
hardly
get
my
shoes
on
and
they
was
going
out
for
riffle
practice
and
i
do
need
no
riffle
practice
al
and
besides
that
i
could
of
stood
it
so
i
got
excused
and
i
set
around
a
wile
after
the
rest
of
the
bunch
was
gone
and
finely
my
feet
got
feeling
a
little
better
and
i
walked
over
to
the
estaminet
where
that
little
at
to
see
if
maybe
i
could
brighten
things
up
a
little
for
her
and
sure
enough
she
was
all
smiles
when
she
seen
me
and
we
talked
a
wile
about
this
in
that
and
she
tried
to
get
personal
and
called
me
cherry
which
is
like
we
say
dearie
and
finely
i
made
the
remark
that
i
did
think
we
would
be
here
much
longer
and
then
i
seen
she
was
going
to
blubber
so
i
kind
of
petted
her
hand
and
stroked
her
hair
and
she
poked
her
lips
out
and
i
give
her
a
smack
al
but
just
like
you
would
kiss
a
kid
or
something
after
they
fell
down
and
hurt
themself
well
al
just
as
this
was
comeing
off
the
door
to
the
other
part
of
the
joint
opened
up
and
in
come
her
old
man
and
seen
it
and
i
thought
all
frenchmens
talked
fast
al
but
this
old
bird
made
them
sound
like
a
impediment
and
he
come
at
me
and
if
he
had
been
so
old
i
would
of
crowned
him
but
of
course
i
could
do
nothing
only
let
him
rave
and
finely
i
felt
kind
of
sorry
for
him
and
i
had
a
frank
note
on
me
so
i
shoved
it
at
him
and
it
struck
him
dumb
al
and
i
got
out
of
there
and
come
back
to
the
ark
and
it
seems
like
i
had
been
away
a
whole
lot
longer
then
i
meant
to
and
any
way
i
had
hardly
no
more
then
got
my
shoes
off
and
layed
down
when
in
come
some
of
the
boys
well
al
what
do
you
think
pershing
was
out
there
to
the
riffle
practice
to
overlook
them
and
i
suppose
he
heard
we
was
going
to
be
out
there
and
he
went
out
there
to
be
sure
and
catch
me
and
he
was
makeing
a
visit
around
the
camp
and
instead
of
him
stopping
here
he
went
out
there
to
see
us
and
instead
of
me
being
out
there
al
here
i
was
mixed
up
in
a
riot
with
an
old
goof
over
nothing
you
might
say
and
black
jack
wondring
where
and
the
he
ll
could
i
be
at
because
alcock
told
me
he
noticed
him
looking
around
like
he
mist
somebody
and
now
he
on
his
way
back
to
paris
and
probably
sore
as
a
boil
and
i
ca
do
nothing
only
wait
to
hear
from
him
and
probably
he
will
just
decide
to
pass
me
up
and
the
worst
of
it
is
al
that
when
they
brought
us
the
mail
they
was
letters
for
me
from
florrie
and
i
could
of
asked
for
nicer
letters
if
i
had
wrote
them
myself
only
why
and
the
he
ll
could
she
of
wrote
them
a
day
sooner
and
i
would
of
no
more
thought
of
getting
excused
today
then
fly
because
if
i
had
knew
how
my
mist
me
and
how
much
she
cares
i
of
been
waisting
no
time
on
no
ernestine
but
its
to
late
now
and
black
jack
gone
and
so
is
my
franks
and
believe
me
al
frank
notes
is
tray
pew
over
here
i
say
they
are
your
pal
jack
chapter
iv
decorated
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
yesterday
was
april
fool
and
you
ought
to
seen
what
i
pulled
on
of
the
boys
johnny
alcock
and
it
was
a
screen
and
some
of
the
boys
is
still
laughing
over
it
yet
but
he
is
i
of
the
kind
that
he
see
a
joke
at
their
own
expenses
and
he
swelled
up
like
a
poison
pup
and
now
he
is
talking
about
he
will
get
even
with
me
but
the
bird
that
gets
even
with
me
will
half
to
get
up
a
long
time
before
revelry
eh
al
well
al
i
will
tell
you
what
i
pulled
on
him
and
i
bet
you
will
bust
your
sides
well
it
seems
like
johnny
has
got
a
girl
in
his
home
town
riverside
near
chi
and
that
is
he
do
know
if
he
has
got
her
or
not
because
him
and
another
bird
was
both
makeing
a
play
for
her
but
before
he
come
away
she
told
him
to
not
worry
but
the
other
bird
got
himself
excused
out
of
the
draft
with
a
cold
sore
or
something
and
is
still
there
in
the
old
town
yet
where
he
can
go
and
call
on
her
every
night
and
she
is
libel
to
figure
that
maybe
she
better
marry
him
so
as
she
can
have
some
of
her
evenings
to
herself
and
any
way
she
might
as
well
of
told
johnny
to
not
scratch
himself
over
here
as
to
not
worry
because
for
some
reason
another
the
gal
did
write
to
him
last
month
at
lease
he
did
get
no
letters
and
maybe
they
got
lost
or
she
had
writers
cramps
or
something
but
any
way
every
time
the
mail
come
and
nothing
for
him
he
looked
like
he
had
been
caught
off
second
base
well
the
day
before
yesterday
he
was
reading
of
the
letters
he
got
from
this
baby
or
wks
ago
on
acct
of
not
haveing
nothing
better
to
read
and
he
left
the
envelope
lay
on
the
floor
and
i
was
going
to
hand
it
back
to
him
but
i
happened
to
think
that
yesterday
would
be
april
fool
so
i
kept
a
hold
of
the
envelope
and
i
got
a
piece
of
paper
and
wrote
april
fool
on
it
and
stuck
it
in
the
envelope
and
fixed
it
up
so
as
it
would
look
like
a
new
letter
and
i
handed
it
to
him
yesterday
like
it
was
mail
that
had
only
just
came
for
him
and
you
ought
to
see
him
when
he
tore
it
open
and
find
nothing
only
april
fool
in
it
at
first
he
could
say
nothing
but
finely
he
says
that
some
comedy
keefe
you
ought
to
be
a
end
man
in
the
stretcher
bearers
minstrels
and
he
did
crack
a
smile
so
i
said
the
matter
with
you
ca
you
take
a
joke
so
he
said
what
i
would
like
to
take
is
a
crack
at
your
jaw
so
i
said
well
it
to
bad
your
arms
is
both
paralyzed
well
al
they
nothing
the
matter
with
his
arms
and
i
was
just
kidding
him
because
as
far
as
him
hitting
anybody
is
conserned
i
was
just
as
safe
as
the
staff
because
he
ai
much
bigger
than
a
cutie
and
for
him
to
reach
my
jaw
he
would
half
to
join
the
aviation
well
of
course
he
did
start
nothing
but
just
said
he
would
get
back
at
me
if
it
took
him
till
the
duration
of
the
war
and
i
told
some
of
the
other
boys
about
putting
it
over
on
him
and
they
could
hardly
help
from
smileing
but
he
acts
like
a
baby
and
do
speak
to
me
and
i
suppose
maybe
he
thinks
that
makes
me
feel
bad
but
i
got
to
be
yrs
old
before
i
ever
seen
him
and
if
his
head
was
blowed
off
tomorrow
i
would
try
and
show
up
for
my
meals
a
day
if
you
could
call
them
that
but
speaking
about
april
fool
al
i
just
stopped
writeing
to
try
and
light
a
cigarette
with
of
these
here
french
matchs
and
every
one
of
them
is
a
april
fool
and
i
guess
the
parents
of
the
kids
over
here
do
never
half
to
worry
about
them
smokeing
to
young
because
even
if
they
had
a
box
of
cigarettes
hid
in
their
cradle
they
would
be
of
age
before
they
would
run
across
a
match
that
lit
and
i
would
be
scared
to
give
little
al
a
bunch
and
turn
him
loose
in
a
bbl
of
gasoline
well
al
i
suppose
you
been
reading
in
the
papers
about
the
dutchmens
starting
a
drive
the
english
up
in
the
northren
part
of
the
section
and
at
first
it
looked
like
the
english
was
going
to
leave
them
walk
into
the
gulf
stream
and
scald
themself
to
death
but
now
it
seems
like
we
have
got
them
slowed
up
at
lease
that
the
dope
we
get
here
but
for
all
the
news
we
get
a
hold
of
we
might
as
well
of
jumped
to
the
codfish
league
on
the
way
over
and
once
in
a
wile
some
of
the
boys
gets
a
paper
a
mo
old
but
they
hog
onto
it
and
do
leave
nobody
else
see
it
but
as
far
as
i
am
conserned
they
can
keep
it
because
i
have
no
time
to
waist
reading
about
the
frisco
fair
or
the
federal
league
has
blowed
up
and
etc
and
of
course
they
plenty
of
newspapers
from
paris
but
all
printed
in
la
la
la
so
as
every
time
you
come
to
a
word
you
half
to
rumage
through
a
dictionary
and
even
when
you
run
it
down
its
libel
to
mean
different
articles
and
by
the
time
you
figured
out
whether
they
are
talking
about
a
car
or
a
hot
bath
or
a
raisin
or
what
and
the
he
ll
they
are
talking
about
they
would
be
no
more
news
to
it
then
the
bible
and
it
looks
to
me
al
like
it
would
be
a
good
idear
if
you
was
to
drop
me
a
post
card
when
the
war
is
over
so
as
i
can
tell
capt
seeley
or
he
will
still
be
running
us
ragged
to
get
in
shape
a
couple
of
yrs
after
the
last
of
the
dutchmens
lays
molting
in
the
grave
jokeing
to
side
al
you
probably
know
what
going
on
a
long
wile
before
we
do
and
the
only
chance
we
would
have
to
know
how
a
battle
come
out
would
be
if
we
was
in
it
and
they
no
chance
of
that
unless
they
send
us
up
to
the
northern
part
of
the
section
to
help
out
because
van
hindenburg
must
have
something
under
his
hat
besides
bristles
and
he
ai
a
sucker
enough
to
start
driveing
the
front
that
we
are
behind
it
unless
he
is
so
homesick
that
he
ca
stand
it
no
longer
in
france
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
of
the
chi
newspapers
is
getting
out
a
paper
in
paris
and
printed
in
english
and
i
just
seen
a
copy
of
it
where
the
allys
has
finely
got
wise
to
themself
and
made
man
of
all
the
allys
and
it
was
a
sucker
play
to
not
do
that
long
ago
only
it
looks
to
me
like
they
pulled
another
boner
by
makeing
a
frenchman
the
and
i
suppose
they
done
it
for
a
complement
to
the
frenchmens
on
acct
of
the
war
being
here
but
even
suppose
this
here
foch
is
a
smart
and
use
his
brains
and
etc
it
looks
to
me
like
it
would
of
been
a
whole
lot
better
to
of
picked
out
a
man
that
can
speak
english
because
suppose
we
was
all
in
a
big
battle
or
something
and
he
wanted
we
should
go
over
the
top
and
if
he
said
it
in
french
why
most
of
the
boys
has
made
no
attempts
to
master
the
language
and
as
far
as
they
was
conserned
he
might
as
well
be
telling
them
to
wash
their
neck
or
else
they
would
half
to
be
interpeters
to
translate
it
out
in
english
what
he
was
getting
at
and
by
the
time
he
give
the
orders
to
fire
and
the
interpeter
looked
it
up
and
seen
what
it
meant
in
english
and
then
tell
us
about
it
the
dutchmens
would
be
putting
peep
holes
through
us
with
a
bayonet
and
besides
the
french
word
for
fire
in
english
is
feu
in
french
and
you
say
it
like
it
was
few
and
if
foch
yelled
few
we
might
think
he
was
complaining
of
the
heat
but
at
that
its
better
to
have
i
man
running
it
even
a
frenchman
then
a
lot
of
different
gens
telling
us
to
do
this
in
that
and
the
other
thing
every
one
of
them
different
and
suppose
they
done
that
in
baseball
al
and
a
club
had
or
mgrs
and
suppose
for
inst
it
come
up
to
the
inning
and
we
needed
some
runs
and
it
was
benz
turn
to
hit
and
mgr
would
tell
him
to
go
up
and
hit
for
himself
and
another
mgr
would
tell
murphy
to
go
up
and
hit
for
him
and
another
mgr
would
send
risberg
up
and
another
would
send
russell
and
the
next
thing
you
know
they
would
be
of
them
swinging
from
side
of
the
plate
and
from
the
other
side
and
probably
busting
each
other
in
the
bean
with
their
bats
but
you
take
most
bird
beans
and
what
would
break
would
be
mr
bat
but
its
the
same
in
war
like
in
baseball
and
you
got
to
have
man
running
it
with
a
lot
of
different
gens
in
command
of
them
might
tell
the
men
to
charge
while
another
was
telling
them
to
pay
cash
jokeing
to
side
al
some
of
our
boys
have
overtook
a
section
up
along
the
moose
river
and
i
would
dast
write
about
it
only
its
been
printed
in
the
papers
all
ready
so
i
am
not
giveing
away
no
secrets
to
the
dutchmens
at
lease
they
do
mind
us
writeing
something
that
came
out
in
the
papers
though
as
far
as
i
can
see
how
would
the
dutchmens
know
it
any
more
if
it
was
in
the
papers
or
not
because
they
ai
so
choked
with
jack
over
in
germany
that
they
are
going
to
spend
it
on
papers
a
mo
old
and
even
when
they
got
them
they
would
half
to
find
somebody
that
could
read
english
and
had
been
killed
for
it
and
it
would
be
like
as
if
i
should
spend
part
of
my
a
mo
subscribeing
to
the
chop
suey
bladder
that
you
would
half
to
lay
on
your
stomach
and
hold
it
with
your
feet
to
get
it
right
side
up
and
even
then
it
would
mean
nothing
but
any
way
the
dutchmens
is
going
to
know
sooner
or
later
that
we
are
in
the
war
and
what
the
differents
if
they
meet
us
at
the
moose
or
the
elks
jokeing
a
side
al
i
guess
you
wo
be
supprised
to
hear
how
i
have
picked
up
in
the
riffle
practice
and
i
knew
right
along
that
i
could
hardly
help
from
being
a
a
no
marksman
because
a
man
that
had
almost
perfect
control
in
pitching
you
might
say
would
be
bound
to
shoot
straight
when
they
got
the
hang
of
it
and
do
be
supprised
if
i
write
you
of
these
days
that
i
been
appointed
a
snipper
that
sets
up
in
a
tree
somewheres
and
picks
off
the
boshs
whenever
they
stick
their
head
up
and
they
call
them
snippers
so
pretty
soon
my
name
is
libel
to
be
jake
snipe
instead
of
jack
keefe
but
seriously
al
i
can
pick
off
them
targets
like
they
was
cherrys
or
something
and
maybe
i
wo
half
to
go
in
the
trenchs
at
all
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
about
that
little
trick
i
pulled
on
johnny
alcock
for
a
april
fool
gag
and
at
first
he
swelled
up
like
a
poison
pup
and
would
talk
to
me
and
said
he
would
never
rest
till
he
got
even
well
he
finely
got
a
real
letter
from
the
gal
back
home
and
she
is
still
waiting
for
him
yet
so
he
feels
again
and
i
and
him
are
on
speaking
turns
again
and
i
am
glad
to
not
be
scraping
with
him
because
i
do
never
feel
right
unless
i
am
pals
with
everybody
but
they
ca
nobody
stay
sore
at
me
very
long
and
even
when
some
of
the
boys
in
baseball
use
to
swell
up
when
i
pulled
of
my
gags
on
them
it
would
last
long
because
i
would
just
smile
at
them
and
they
would
half
to
smile
back
and
be
pals
and
i
always
say
that
if
a
man
ca
take
a
joke
he
better
take
acid
or
something
and
make
a
corps
out
of
himself
instead
of
a
monkey
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
i
do
suppose
you
knew
i
was
a
detective
but
when
it
comes
to
being
a
dick
it
looks
like
i
do
half
to
salute
win
burns
or
shylock
or
none
of
them
seriously
al
i
come
onto
something
today
that
may
turn
out
to
be
something
big
and
then
again
it
may
not
but
it
looks
like
it
was
something
big
only
of
course
it
has
got
to
be
kept
a
secret
till
i
get
the
goods
on
a
certain
bird
and
i
wo
pull
it
till
i
have
got
him
right
and
in
that
way
he
suspect
nothing
until
its
to
late
but
i
know
you
would
breath
a
word
about
it
and
besides
it
would
hurt
nothing
if
you
did
because
by
the
time
you
get
this
letter
the
whole
thing
will
be
over
and
this
bird
to
who
i
refer
will
probably
own
a
peace
of
land
in
france
with
a
frontidge
and
deep
but
you
will
wonder
what
am
i
trying
to
get
at
so
maybe
i
better
explain
myself
well
al
they
a
big
bird
in
our
co
name
geo
shaffer
and
that
a
german
name
because
look
at
schaefer
that
use
to
play
ball
in
our
league
and
it
was
spelt
different
but
they
called
him
germany
and
he
thought
he
was
funny
and
use
to
pull
gags
on
the
field
but
i
guess
he
did
feel
so
funny
the
day
griffith
sent
him
up
to
hit
against
me
in
the
pinch
i
day
at
washington
and
if
the
ball
he
hit
had
of
went
straight
out
instead
of
straight
up
it
would
of
pretty
near
cleared
the
infield
but
any
way
this
bird
shaffer
in
our
is
big
enough
to
have
a
corporal
to
himself
and
they
must
of
spent
the
first
liberty
loan
on
his
uniform
and
he
has
hardly
said
a
word
since
we
been
in
france
and
for
a
wile
we
figured
it
was
just
because
he
was
a
crab
and
to
grouchy
to
talk
but
now
i
would
be
supprised
al
if
the
real
reason
was
on
acct
of
him
being
a
dutchman
and
maybe
ca
talk
english
very
good
well
i
would
feel
pretty
mean
to
be
spying
on
most
of
the
boys
that
been
good
pals
with
me
but
when
a
man
is
a
pro
german
spy
himself
they
no
question
of
friendship
and
etc
and
whatever
i
can
do
to
show
this
bird
up
i
wo
hesitate
a
minute
well
al
this
bird
was
writeing
a
letter
last
night
and
he
did
have
no
envelope
and
he
asked
me
did
i
have
i
and
i
said
no
and
he
would
of
never
spoke
only
to
say
gim
me
but
when
i
told
him
i
did
have
no
envelope
he
started
off
somewheres
to
get
and
he
dropped
the
last
page
out
of
the
letter
he
had
been
writeing
and
it
was
laying
right
there
along
side
of
me
and
of
course
i
would
of
paid
no
tension
to
it
only
it
was
face
up
so
as
i
could
help
from
seeing
it
and
what
i
seen
was
no
words
like
a
man
would
write
in
a
letter
but
it
was
a
bunch
of
marks
like
a
x
down
at
the
bottom
and
they
was
a
whole
line
of
them
like
this
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
well
that
roused
up
my
suspicions
and
i
guess
you
know
i
am
not
the
kind
that
reads
other
people
letters
even
if
i
do
get
none
of
my
own
to
read
but
this
here
letter
i
kind
of
felt
like
they
was
something
funny
about
it
like
he
was
writeing
in
ciphers
or
something
so
i
picked
the
page
up
and
read
it
through
and
sure
enough
they
was
parts
of
it
in
ciphers
and
if
a
man
did
have
the
key
you
could
tell
what
and
the
he
ll
he
was
getting
at
well
al
i
was
still
studing
the
page
yet
when
he
come
back
in
and
they
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
only
set
on
it
so
as
he
would
see
i
had
it
and
he
come
over
and
begin
looking
for
it
and
i
asked
him
had
he
lost
something
to
throw
him
off
the
track
and
he
said
yes
but
he
did
say
what
it
was
and
that
made
it
all
the
more
suspicious
so
he
finely
give
up
looking
and
went
out
again
well
i
have
got
it
put
away
where
he
ca
get
a
hold
of
it
because
i
showed
it
to
johnny
alcock
this
and
asked
him
if
it
did
look
like
something
off
color
and
he
said
yes
it
did
and
if
he
was
me
he
would
turn
it
over
to
capt
seeley
but
on
thoughts
he
said
i
better
keep
it
a
wile
and
at
the
same
time
keep
a
eye
on
shaffer
and
get
more
evidents
him
and
then
when
i
had
him
dead
to
rights
i
could
turn
the
letter
and
the
rest
of
the
evidents
over
to
capt
seeley
and
then
i
would
be
sure
to
get
the
credit
for
showing
him
up
well
al
i
figure
this
page
of
his
letter
is
enough
or
more
then
enough
only
of
course
its
best
to
play
safe
and
keep
my
eyes
pealed
and
see
what
comes
off
and
i
have
got
time
to
copy
down
the
whole
page
al
and
besides
they
a
few
sentences
that
sounds
and
i
suppose
he
put
them
in
for
a
blind
but
you
ca
get
away
from
them
x
marks
al
and
i
will
write
down
a
couple
other
sentences
and
i
bet
you
will
agree
that
they
something
fishy
about
them
and
here
is
the
sentences
to
which
i
refer
in
regards
to
your
question
i
guess
i
understand
in
reply
will
say
yes
more
than
am
i
right
have
you
saw
give
him
a
ring
and
tell
the
old
spinort
i
am
outside
of
a
little
vin
blank
can
you
make
heads
or
tales
out
of
that
al
i
guess
not
and
neither
could
anybody
else
except
they
had
the
key
to
it
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
his
name
is
signed
down
at
the
bottom
and
if
he
can
explain
that
line
of
talk
he
is
a
wonder
but
he
ca
explain
it
al
and
all
as
he
can
do
is
make
a
clean
brest
of
the
whole
business
and
alcock
thinks
the
same
way
and
alcock
says
he
wished
he
had
of
been
the
that
got
a
hold
of
this
evidents
because
whoever
turned
it
over
to
capt
sceley
along
with
what
other
facts
i
can
get
a
hold
of
will
just
about
get
a
commission
in
the
intelligents
dept
and
that
the
men
that
looks
after
the
pro
german
spys
al
and
gets
the
dope
on
them
and
shows
them
up
and
i
would
probably
have
my
head
quarters
in
paris
and
get
good
money
besides
my
expenses
and
i
would
half
to
pass
up
the
chance
to
get
in
the
trenchs
and
fight
but
they
more
ways
of
fighting
then
and
in
this
game
al
a
man
has
got
to
go
where
they
send
you
and
where
they
figure
they
would
do
the
most
good
and
if
my
country
needs
me
to
track
after
spys
i
will
sacrifice
my
own
wishs
though
i
would
a
whole
lot
rather
stay
with
my
pals
and
fight
along
side
of
them
and
not
snoop
round
paris
fondleing
door
nobs
like
a
night
watchman
but
alcock
says
he
would
bet
money
that
is
where
i
will
land
and
he
says
you
ought
to
feel
right
at
home
in
the
intelligents
dept
like
a
camel
in
lake
erie
and
he
says
the
first
chance
i
get
i
better
try
and
start
up
a
conversation
with
shaffer
and
try
and
lead
him
on
and
that
is
the
way
they
trap
them
is
to
ask
them
a
whole
lot
of
questions
and
see
what
they
have
got
to
say
and
if
you
keep
fireing
questions
at
them
they
are
bound
to
get
balled
up
and
then
its
good
night
well
i
do
suppose
it
seems
possible
to
you
stay
at
homes
that
they
could
be
such
a
thing
like
a
pro
german
spy
in
the
army
and
how
did
he
get
there
and
why
did
they
leave
him
in
and
etc
well
al
you
would
be
supprised
to
know
how
many
of
them
has
slipped
in
and
alcock
says
that
at
first
it
amounted
to
about
but
the
intelligents
officers
has
been
on
their
sent
all
the
wile
and
most
of
them
has
been
nailed
and
when
they
get
them
they
shoot
them
down
like
a
dog
and
that
what
shaffer
will
get
al
and
he
is
out
of
luck
to
be
so
big
because
all
as
the
fireing
squad
would
half
to
do
would
be
look
at
their
compass
and
see
if
he
was
east
or
west
of
them
and
then
face
their
riffle
in
that
direction
and
let
go
i
will
write
and
let
you
know
how
things
comes
along
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
i
am
closeing
the
net
of
evidents
around
shaffer
and
i
guess
i
all
ready
got
enough
on
him
to
make
out
a
case
that
he
never
wrinkle
out
of
it
but
capt
seeley
is
away
and
i
ca
do
nothing
till
he
gets
back
i
had
my
man
on
the
grill
today
al
and
i
thought
he
would
be
a
fox
and
not
criminate
himself
but
i
guess
i
went
at
him
so
smooth
he
did
never
suspect
nothing
till
along
towards
the
finish
and
then
it
was
to
late
i
do
remember
all
that
was
said
but
it
run
along
these
lines
like
as
follows
in
the
first
place
i
asked
him
where
he
lived
and
he
said
milwaukee
in
chi
and
i
do
know
if
you
know
it
or
not
al
but
a
where
they
have
got
traffic
policemens
at
the
corners
to
blow
their
whistles
once
for
the
germans
to
go
north
and
south
and
twice
for
them
to
go
east
and
west
so
then
i
said
was
he
married
and
he
says
no
so
then
i
asked
him
where
he
was
born
and
he
said
what
and
the
he
ll
are
you
the
personal
officer
so
i
laughed
it
off
and
said
no
but
i
thought
maybe
we
come
from
the
same
part
of
the
country
so
he
says
something
about
everybody
did
half
to
come
from
the
country
but
he
would
come
out
and
say
where
he
did
come
from
so
then
i
kind
of
led
around
to
the
war
and
i
made
the
remark
that
the
german
drive
up
on
the
north
side
of
france
get
very
far
and
he
says
maybe
they
was
through
how
was
that
for
a
fine
line
of
talk
al
and
he
might
as
well
have
said
he
hoped
the
germans
would
never
be
stopped
well
for
a
minute
i
could
hardly
help
from
takeing
a
crack
at
him
but
in
these
kind
of
matters
al
a
man
has
got
to
keep
a
hold
of
themself
or
they
will
loose
their
quarry
so
i
kind
of
forced
a
smile
and
said
well
i
guess
they
would
have
kept
going
if
they
could
of
and
then
he
says
yes
but
they
half
to
stop
every
once
in
a
wile
to
bring
up
van
hindenburg
so
i
had
him
traped
al
and
quick
is
a
flash
i
said
who
told
you
their
plans
and
he
says
oh
he
ll
my
mother
in
law
and
walked
away
from
me
well
al
it
was
just
like
sometimes
when
they
are
trying
a
man
for
murder
and
he
says
he
could
of
did
it
because
he
was
over
to
the
elite
jazing
when
it
come
off
and
a
little
wile
later
the
lawyer
asks
him
where
did
he
say
he
was
at
when
the
party
was
croked
and
he
forgets
what
he
said
the
time
and
says
he
was
out
to
lincoln
pk
kidding
the
bison
or
something
and
the
lawyer
points
out
to
the
jury
where
his
storys
do
jib
and
the
next
thing
you
know
he
is
dressed
up
in
a
hemp
collar
a
couple
sizes
to
small
and
that
the
same
way
i
triped
shaffer
getting
him
to
say
he
married
and
finely
when
i
have
him
cornered
he
busts
out
about
his
mother
in
law
well
al
i
do
know
of
no
way
to
get
a
mother
in
law
without
marrying
into
one
so
i
told
alcock
tonight
what
had
came
off
and
he
says
it
looked
to
him
like
i
had
a
strong
case
and
if
he
was
me
he
would
spill
it
to
capt
seeley
the
minute
he
gets
back
and
he
said
you
lucky
stiff
you
wo
never
see
the
inside
of
a
front
line
trench
so
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
and
he
repeated
over
again
what
he
said
about
them
takeing
me
in
the
intelligents
dept
so
it
looks
like
i
was
about
through
being
a
doughboy
al
and
pretty
soon
i
will
probably
be
writeing
to
you
from
paris
but
i
do
suppose
i
will
be
able
to
tell
you
what
i
am
doing
because
that
the
kind
of
a
job
where
mum
is
the
word
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
old
pal
do
be
supprised
if
i
write
you
the
next
time
from
paris
i
have
got
a
date
to
see
capt
seeley
tomorrow
and
lieut
mather
fixed
it
up
for
me
to
see
him
but
i
had
to
convince
the
lieut
that
it
was
no
monkey
business
because
they
always
a
whole
lot
of
riffs
and
raffs
asking
capt
seeley
can
they
have
a
word
with
him
and
what
they
want
is
to
borry
his
knife
to
pair
their
finger
nails
but
i
guess
he
wo
be
sorry
he
seen
me
al
not
when
i
show
him
the
stuff
i
have
got
on
this
bird
and
he
will
probably
shake
me
by
the
hand
and
say
well
keefe
uncle
sam
is
proud
of
you
but
you
are
waisting
your
time
here
and
i
will
be
sorry
to
loose
you
but
it
looks
like
you
belong
in
other
fields
and
he
will
wire
a
telegram
to
the
staff
reccomending
me
to
go
to
paris
i
guess
i
all
ready
told
you
some
of
the
stuff
i
have
got
on
this
bird
but
i
have
not
told
you
all
because
the
best
one
did
only
happen
last
night
well
on
acct
of
i
and
alcock
being
friends
he
has
kind
of
been
keeping
a
eye
pealed
on
shaffer
to
help
me
out
and
he
found
a
letter
last
night
that
shaffer
had
wrote
and
this
time
it
was
the
whole
letter
with
the
address
and
everything
and
who
do
you
suppose
it
was
to
well
al
it
was
to
van
hindenburg
himself
and
i
have
got
it
right
here
where
i
can
keep
a
eye
on
it
and
believe
me
it
worth
watching
and
i
wished
i
could
send
it
to
you
so
you
could
see
for
yourself
what
kind
of
a
bird
we
are
dealing
with
but
that
impossible
al
but
they
nothing
to
keep
me
from
copping
it
off
well
the
letter
is
wrote
in
german
and
to
show
you
what
a
foxy
bird
he
is
he
wrote
it
out
in
printing
so
as
if
it
got
found
by
somebody
they
prove
he
wrote
it
because
when
words
is
wrote
out
in
printing
it
looks
just
the
same
who
ever
wrote
it
and
you
ca
tell
but
he
was
foxy
enough
to
not
sign
down
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
that
stands
for
his
name
george
shaffer
and
he
is
the
only
in
the
so
it
looks
like
we
had
him
up
in
a
tree
here
is
what
the
letter
says
field
marshall
van
hindenburg
die
vierten
dachshunds
deutscher
armee
flanders
soldaten
schon
in
frankreich
doch
in
lauterbach
habe
ich
mein
strumpf
verloren
und
ohne
strumpf
gehe
ich
nicht
heim
xxxxxxx
notice
them
x
marks
again
al
like
in
the
other
letter
and
the
other
letter
was
probably
to
van
hindenburg
to
and
i
only
wished
i
knew
what
the
x
marks
means
but
maybe
some
of
the
birds
that
all
ready
in
the
intelligents
dept
can
figure
it
out
but
they
no
mystery
about
the
rest
of
it
al
because
alcock
understands
german
and
he
translated
it
out
what
the
german
words
means
and
here
is
what
it
means
united
states
soldiers
in
france
all
ready
yet
will
advise
you
when
to
attack
on
this
front
how
is
that
al
for
a
fine
trader
and
spy
to
tell
the
of
the
german
army
how
many
soldiers
we
got
over
here
and
to
not
attack
till
shaffer
says
the
word
and
he
was
probably
going
to
say
it
wile
we
was
all
asleep
or
something
but
thanks
to
me
al
he
will
be
the
one
that
is
asleep
and
it
will
be
some
sleep
al
and
it
will
make
old
rip
and
winkle
look
like
they
had
the
colic
and
when
the
boys
finds
out
what
i
done
for
them
i
guess
they
wo
be
nothing
to
good
for
me
but
it
will
be
to
late
for
them
to
show
their
appreciations
because
i
wo
be
here
no
more
and
the
boys
probably
wo
see
me
again
till
its
all
over
and
we
are
back
in
the
old
because
alcock
was
talking
to
a
bird
that
in
the
int
dept
and
he
says
of
their
dutys
was
to
keep
away
from
everybody
and
not
leave
them
know
who
you
are
because
of
course
if
word
got
out
that
you
was
a
spy
chaser
the
spys
would
hardly
run
up
and
kiss
you
on
the
but
they
would
duck
when
they
seen
you
and
you
would
have
as
much
chance
to
catch
them
as
though
you
was
trolling
for
wales
with
a
grass
hopper
and
from
this
bird
dope
that
alcock
was
talking
to
i
will
half
to
leave
off
my
uniform
and
wear
plain
close
and
maybe
wear
false
whiskers
and
etc
so
as
people
who
see
me
the
time
i
will
look
different
to
them
the
next
time
they
see
me
and
maybe
i
will
half
to
let
my
mustache
grow
and
grease
it
so
as
they
will
think
maybe
i
am
a
dutchman
and
if
they
are
working
for
the
kaiser
i
could
maybe
pump
them
but
they
thing
i
do
like
about
it
al
because
alcock
says
paris
is
full
of
women
that
is
exactly
spys
but
they
have
been
made
a
fool
out
of
and
they
are
some
german
duke
but
the
dutchmens
tells
them
a
whole
lot
of
things
that
uncle
sam
would
like
to
know
and
i
would
half
to
find
them
things
out
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
get
them
stuck
on
me
and
i
guess
that
would
be
no
chore
but
when
a
gal
gets
stuck
on
you
they
will
tell
you
everything
they
know
and
wile
with
most
gals
i
ever
seen
they
could
do
that
without
dropping
another
nickle
still
and
all
it
would
be
different
with
these
gals
in
paris
that
been
the
tools
of
some
dutchmens
because
you
take
a
german
and
he
do
never
stop
braging
till
he
inhales
a
bayonet
illustration
when
a
gal
gets
stuck
on
you
they
will
tell
you
everything
they
know
but
it
do
seem
fair
to
make
love
to
them
and
pertend
like
i
was
nuts
over
them
and
then
when
i
had
learned
all
they
was
to
know
i
would
half
to
get
rid
of
them
and
cast
them
to
side
and
god
knows
how
many
wounds
i
will
leave
behind
me
but
probably
as
many
as
though
i
was
a
regular
soldier
or
snipper
but
then
i
would
feel
so
bad
about
it
because
it
would
be
men
and
not
girlies
but
everything
goes
in
war
fair
as
they
say
al
and
if
uncle
sam
and
pershing
asks
me
to
do
it
i
will
do
whatever
they
ask
me
and
they
ca
nobody
really
hold
it
me
because
of
why
i
am
doing
it
but
talking
about
snippers
al
i
noticed
today
that
i
was
near
as
good
as
usual
in
the
riffle
practice
and
it
was
like
as
if
i
was
haveing
a
slump
like
some
of
the
boys
does
in
baseball
when
they
go
along
or
days
without
finding
out
who
is
umpireing
the
bases
and
i
am
afraid
that
is
how
it
would
be
with
me
in
snipping
i
would
be
part
of
the
time
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
could
hit
europe
and
maybe
i
would
fall
down
when
they
was
depending
on
me
and
then
i
would
feel
like
a
rummy
so
i
guess
i
better
not
try
and
show
up
so
good
in
practice
even
when
i
do
feel
because
they
might
make
a
snipper
out
of
me
without
knowing
my
weakness
and
i
figure
its
something
the
matter
with
my
eyes
besides
al
it
do
seem
like
its
a
fair
game
to
be
pecking
away
at
somebody
that
they
ca
see
you
and
are
looking
for
no
supprise
and
its
a
whole
lot
different
then
fighting
with
a
bayonet
where
its
man
to
man
and
may
the
best
man
win
well
al
i
guess
i
have
told
you
all
the
news
and
things
is
going
along
about
as
usual
and
they
do
seem
to
be
no
prospects
of
us
overtakeing
a
section
up
to
the
front
but
its
just
train
and
train
and
train
and
if
the
ball
clubs
had
a
training
trip
like
we
been
haveing
they
would
be
so
tired
by
the
of
may
that
they
would
run
out
a
base
on
balls
yesterday
we
past
by
a
flock
of
motor
lauras
that
was
takeing
wounded
back
to
a
base
hospital
somewheres
and
alcock
was
talking
to
of
the
drivers
and
he
said
that
over
of
the
birds
that
getting
wounded
and
killed
these
days
is
the
snippers
and
the
boshs
do
never
rest
till
they
find
out
where
there
nests
is
at
and
then
they
get
all
their
best
marksmens
and
aim
at
where
they
think
the
snipper
has
got
his
nest
and
then
its
good
night
snipper
and
he
is
either
killed
right
out
or
looses
a
couple
of
legs
or
something
i
certainly
feel
sorry
for
the
boys
that
wounded
al
and
every
time
we
see
a
bunch
of
them
all
us
boys
is
crazy
to
get
up
there
to
the
front
and
get
even
for
what
they
done
well
old
pal
i
will
half
to
get
busy
now
and
overlook
the
dope
i
have
got
on
shaffer
so
as
i
will
have
everything
in
order
for
capt
seeley
and
i
will
write
and
let
you
know
how
things
comes
out
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
they
a
whole
lot
of
birds
that
thinks
they
are
wise
and
always
trying
to
pull
off
something
on
somebody
but
once
in
a
wile
they
pick
out
the
wrong
bird
to
pull
it
on
and
then
the
laugh
is
on
the
smart
alex
themself
well
alcock
and
some
of
them
thought
they
was
putting
up
a
game
on
me
and
was
going
to
make
me
look
like
a
monkey
but
before
i
get
through
with
them
al
they
will
be
the
suckers
and
i
will
be
giveing
them
the
horse
laugh
but
what
i
ought
to
do
is
bust
them
in
the
jaw
and
if
i
was
running
this
war
every
bird
that
tried
to
pull
off
some
practical
joke
to
put
a
man
in
bad
i
would
give
a
lead
shower
in
their
honor
some
before
breakfast
alcock
was
trying
to
make
me
believe
that
of
the
boys
in
the
name
geo
shaffer
was
a
german
spy
or
something
and
they
framed
up
a
letter
like
as
if
he
wrote
it
to
van
hindenburg
giveing
away
secrets
in
german
about
our
army
and
etc
but
they
made
the
mistake
of
signing
his
initials
to
the
letter
so
when
i
come
to
think
it
over
i
seen
it
must
be
a
fake
because
a
bird
that
was
a
real
spy
would
never
sign
their
own
name
to
a
letter
but
they
would
sign
john
smith
or
something
but
any
way
i
had
a
hold
of
this
letter
and
a
peace
of
another
letter
that
shaffer
really
did
write
it
and
i
thought
i
would
show
them
to
capt
seeley
and
play
it
safe
because
they
might
be
something
in
them
after
all
and
any
way
it
would
give
him
a
good
laugh
so
yesterday
i
went
and
seen
him
and
he
says
well
keefe
what
can
i
do
for
you
so
i
said
you
ca
do
nothing
for
me
sir
but
this
time
i
can
do
something
for
you
what
would
you
think
if
i
told
you
they
was
a
trader
and
a
german
spy
in
your
so
he
says
i
would
think
you
were
crazy
so
i
said
i
am
afraid
you
will
half
to
think
so
then
but
maybe
you
wo
think
i
am
so
crazy
when
i
show
you
the
goods
so
then
al
i
pulled
that
peace
of
a
letter
on
him
and
showed
it
to
him
and
he
read
it
and
when
he
got
through
he
says
well
it
looks
suspicious
all
right
it
looks
like
the
man
that
wrote
it
was
hacking
up
a
big
plot
to
spring
a
few
dependents
on
his
local
board
the
next
time
they
draft
him
so
i
said
the
bird
that
wrote
that
letter
is
a
dutchman
name
geo
shaffer
so
capt
seeley
says
well
i
wish
him
all
the
luck
in
the
world
and
a
lot
of
little
shaffers
so
i
said
yes
but
what
about
them
x
marks
and
all
them
letters
without
no
words
to
them
so
he
said
did
you
never
correspond
with
a
girl
and
put
some
of
them
xs
down
to
the
bottom
of
your
letter
so
i
says
i
have
wrote
letters
to
a
whole
lot
of
girls
but
i
never
had
to
write
nothing
in
ciphers
because
i
was
never
ashamed
of
anything
i
wrote
so
he
said
well
your
lady
friends
was
all
cheated
then
because
this
is
ciphers
all
right
but
its
the
kind
of
messages
they
love
to
read
because
it
means
kisses
well
al
of
course
i
knew
it
meant
something
like
that
but
i
did
think
a
big
truck
horse
like
shaffer
would
make
such
a
mushmellow
out
of
himself
but
anyway
i
said
to
capt
seeley
i
says
all
right
but
what
about
them
other
initials
without
no
words
to
go
with
them
and
he
says
well
some
more
ciphers
but
they
probably
a
little
gal
out
in
chi
that
half
to
look
at
no
key
to
figure
it
out
so
then
i
pulled
the
other
letter
on
him
the
in
german
and
he
also
smiled
when
he
read
this
one
and
finely
he
says
some
of
your
pals
has
been
playing
a
trick
on
you
like
when
you
come
over
on
the
ship
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
tear
the
letters
up
and
keep
it
quite
and
leave
nobody
know
you
fell
for
it
and
now
i
have
got
a
whole
lot
to
tend
to
so
good
by
so
that
all
that
was
said
between
us
and
i
come
away
and
come
back
to
quarters
and
alcock
and
or
of
the
other
boys
was
there
and
alcock
knew
where
i
had
been
and
i
suppose
he
had
told
the
other
birds
and
they
was
all
set
to
give
me
the
mary
ha
ha
but
i
beat
them
to
it
well
alcock
i
says
when
i
come
in
you
are
some
joke
smith
but
you
would
think
you
was
so
funny
if
i
punched
your
jaw
so
he
turned
kind
of
pail
but
he
forced
a
smile
and
says
well
i
guess
the
vin
blank
is
on
you
this
time
so
i
said
you
wo
get
no
vin
blank
off
me
but
what
you
are
libel
to
get
is
a
wallop
in
the
jaw
so
he
says
you
crabbed
at
me
a
wile
ago
for
not
takeing
a
joke
but
it
looks
like
you
was
the
one
that
could
take
them
now
so
i
said
what
i
would
like
to
take
is
a
poke
at
your
nose
so
that
shut
him
up
and
they
did
none
of
them
get
their
laugh
because
i
had
them
scared
and
if
they
had
of
laughed
i
would
of
made
them
swallow
it
so
after
all
al
the
laugh
is
on
them
because
their
gag
fell
dead
and
i
guess
the
next
time
they
try
and
pull
some
gag
they
will
pick
out
some
hick
from
some
x
roads
to
pull
it
on
and
not
a
bird
that
has
traveled
all
over
the
big
leagues
and
seen
all
they
is
to
see
well
al
i
am
tickled
to
death
i
wo
half
to
give
up
my
uniform
and
snoop
around
paris
like
a
white
wings
double
crossing
women
and
spying
and
etc
and
even
if
the
whole
thing
had
of
been
just
a
joke
i
was
going
to
ask
capt
seeley
to
not
reccomend
me
to
no
int
dept
but
jest
leave
me
be
where
i
am
at
so
as
when
the
time
comes
i
can
fight
fair
like
man
to
man
and
not
behind
no
woman
skirts
like
a
cur
so
you
see
al
everything
is
after
all
and
the
laugh
is
on
alcock
and
his
friends
because
they
was
the
ones
that
expected
to
do
all
the
laughing
but
instead
of
that
i
made
a
monkey
out
of
them
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
al
if
you
would
see
my
face
you
would
think
i
had
been
attending
a
barrage
or
something
or
else
i
had
been
in
a
bar
room
fight
only
of
course
if
it
was
a
fair
fight
i
would
be
so
kind
of
marred
up
like
i
am
but
i
had
a
accident
al
and
fell
over
a
bunk
and
lit
on
the
old
bean
and
the
result
is
al
that
i
have
got
a
black
eye
and
a
bad
nose
and
my
jaw
is
swole
a
little
and
my
ears
feels
kind
of
dull
like
so
i
guess
the
ladys
would
call
me
handsome
jack
if
they
seen
me
but
it
will
be
all
in
a
few
days
and
i
will
be
the
same
old
jack
but
i
will
tell
you
how
it
come
off
i
was
setting
reading
a
letter
from
florrie
that
all
as
she
said
in
it
was
that
she
had
boughten
herself
a
new
suit
that
everybody
says
was
the
cutest
she
ever
had
on
her
back
just
like
i
give
a
dam
because
by
the
time
i
see
her
in
it
she
will
of
gave
it
to
little
al
swede
but
any
way
i
was
reading
this
letter
when
in
come
shaffer
the
bird
that
was
mixed
up
in
that
little
gag
about
the
fake
spy
and
he
come
up
to
me
and
says
well
you
big
snake
who
male
are
you
reading
now
well
al
him
calling
me
big
is
like
i
would
say
hello
jumbo
to
a
flee
but
any
way
i
says
my
own
male
and
who
and
the
he
ll
male
would
i
be
reading
so
he
said
well
its
hard
to
tell
because
you
stole
some
of
mine
and
read
it
and
not
only
that
but
you
showed
it
to
the
whole
so
now
stand
up
and
take
what
comeing
to
you
well
al
i
thought
he
was
just
kidding
so
i
says
i
come
over
here
to
fight
germans
and
not
of
my
own
pals
so
he
says
do
call
me
no
pal
but
if
you
come
to
fight
germans
now
is
your
chance
because
you
say
i
of
them
well
he
kind
of
made
a
funny
motion
like
he
wanted
to
spar
or
wrestle
or
something
and
i
thought
he
meant
it
in
a
friendly
way
like
we
sometimes
pull
off
a
rough
house
once
in
a
wile
so
i
stood
up
but
before
i
had
a
chance
to
take
holds
with
him
he
cut
loose
at
me
with
his
fists
doubled
up
and
i
kind
of
triped
or
something
and
fell
over
a
bench
and
i
must
have
hit
something
sharp
on
the
way
down
and
i
kind
of
got
scratched
up
but
they
are
only
scratchs
and
do
amt
to
nothing
only
i
wished
i
knew
he
had
of
been
serious
and
i
would
of
made
a
punching
bag
out
of
him
and
you
can
bet
that
the
next
time
he
wants
to
start
something
i
wo
wait
to
see
if
he
is
jokeing
but
i
will
tear
into
him
and
he
will
think
he
run
into
a
minnie
weffers
well
i
suppose
alcock
was
sore
at
me
for
getting
the
best
of
him
and
not
falling
for
his
gag
and
he
was
afraid
to
tackle
me
himself
and
he
told
big
shaffer
a
peck
of
lies
about
some
dam
letter
or
something
and
said
i
stole
it
and
it
made
shaffer
sore
and
no
wonder
because
who
would
be
sore
if
they
thought
somebody
was
reading
their
male
but
a
man
like
shaffer
that
if
he
stopped
a
shell
the
dutchmens
would
half
to
move
back
a
ways
so
as
they
would
be
room
enough
in
france
to
bury
him
has
got
no
right
to
pick
on
a
smaller
man
especially
when
i
was
feeling
good
on
acct
of
something
i
eat
but
at
that
al
size
do
make
no
difference
and
its
the
bird
that
got
the
nerve
and
knows
how
that
can
knock
them
dead
and
if
shaffer
had
of
gave
me
any
warning
he
would
of
been
the
that
is
scratched
up
instead
of
i
though
i
guess
he
is
to
lucky
to
trip
over
a
kit
bag
and
fall
down
and
cut
himself
but
my
scratchs
do
really
amt
to
nothing
al
and
in
a
few
days
i
will
be
like
new
your
pal
jack
in
france
april
friend
al
well
old
pal
i
have
got
some
big
news
for
you
now
we
been
ordered
up
to
the
front
and
its
good
by
to
this
class
d
burg
and
now
for
some
real
actions
and
i
am
tickled
to
death
and
i
only
hope
the
dutchmens
will
loose
their
minds
and
try
and
start
something
up
on
the
section
where
we
are
going
to
and
i
ca
tell
you
where
its
at
al
but
you
keep
watching
the
papers
and
even
if
the
boshs
do
start
nothing
maybe
we
will
start
something
on
our
own
acct
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
will
read
where
we
have
got
them
on
the
lincoln
highway
towards
russia
and
believe
me
al
we
wo
half
to
stop
every
little
wile
to
bring
up
no
van
hindenburg
but
we
will
run
them
ragged
and
they
say
the
germans
is
the
best
singers
and
when
they
all
bust
out
with
comrades
they
will
make
the
great
lakes
band
sound
like
the
russia
artillery
well
al
i
am
so
excited
i
ca
write
much
and
i
have
got
a
things
to
tend
to
so
i
will
half
to
cut
this
letter
short
well
some
of
the
other
birds
like
alcock
and
them
is
pertending
like
they
was
tickled
to
death
to
but
believe
me
al
if
the
orders
was
changed
all
of
a
sudden
and
they
told
us
we
was
going
to
stay
here
till
the
duration
of
the
war
we
would
half
to
call
on
the
engrs
to
dam
their
tear
ducks
but
they
pertend
like
they
are
pleased
and
keep
whistleing
so
as
they
blubber
and
today
they
all
laughed
their
heads
off
at
something
that
come
out
in
the
paper
that
some
of
the
boys
gets
out
but
they
laughed
like
they
was
nervous
instead
of
enjoying
it
well
what
come
out
in
the
paper
was
supposed
to
be
a
joke
on
me
and
if
they
think
its
funny
they
are
welcome
and
i
would
send
the
paper
to
you
that
its
in
only
i
have
got
only
the
copy
so
i
will
copy
it
down
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
a
screen
it
is
well
they
peace
that
got
up
to
look
like
it
was
the
casuality
list
in
some
regular
newspaper
and
it
says
wounded
in
action
privates
jack
keefe
chicago
very
and
then
they
another
peace
that
reads
like
this
decorated
the
company
has
won
its
first
war
honors
and
private
jack
keefe
is
the
lucky
dog
private
keefe
has
been
decorated
by
george
shaffer
of
the
dachshunds
for
extreme
courage
and
cleverness
in
showing
up
a
dangerous
nest
of
spies
keefe
was
hit
four
times
by
large
caliber
shells
before
he
could
say
surrender
he
was
decorated
with
the
order
of
the
schwarz
auge
the
order
of
the
rot
nase
and
the
order
of
the
blumenkohl
ohren
besides
which
a
right
cross
was
hung
on
his
jaw
private
keefe
takes
his
honors
very
modestly
no
one
having
even
heard
him
mention
them
except
in
stifled
tones
during
the
night
well
al
all
right
if
they
can
find
something
to
amuse
themself
and
they
need
it
i
guess
but
they
better
remember
that
they
plenty
of
time
for
the
laugh
to
be
on
the
other
foot
before
this
war
is
over
your
pal
jack
chapter
v
sammy
boy
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
i
have
wrote
you
no
letter
for
a
long
wile
and
i
suppose
maybe
you
think
something
might
of
happened
to
me
or
something
well
old
pal
they
has
nothing
happened
and
i
only
wished
they
would
because
anything
would
be
better
than
laying
around
here
and
i
would
rather
stop
a
shell
and
get
spread
all
over
europe
then
lay
around
here
and
die
a
day
at
a
time
you
might
say
well
i
would
of
wrote
you
before
only
we
was
on
the
march
and
by
the
time
night
come
around
my
dogs
fret
me
so
bad
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
when
they
told
us
we
was
comeing
up
here
i
thought
of
course
they
would
send
us
up
in
motor
lauras
or
something
and
not
wear
us
all
out
before
we
got
here
but
no
it
was
drill
every
of
the
way
and
i
said
to
johnny
alcock
the
night
we
got
here
that
when
they
was
sending
us
up
here
to
die
they
might
at
lease
give
us
a
ride
and
he
says
no
because
when
they
send
a
man
to
the
electric
chair
they
do
push
him
up
there
in
a
go
cart
but
they
make
him
get
there
on
his
own
dogs
so
i
said
yes
but
he
travels
light
and
he
do
half
to
go
far
and
when
he
gets
there
they
a
chair
waiting
for
him
to
set
down
in
it
but
they
load
us
up
like
a
troop
ship
and
walk
us
way
to
sweden
and
when
we
finely
get
here
we
can
either
remain
standing
or
lay
down
in
a
mud
puddle
and
tuck
ourself
in
and
another
thing
al
i
thought
they
meant
we
was
going
right
in
the
front
line
trenchs
where
a
man
has
got
a
chance
to
see
some
fun
but
where
we
are
at
is
what
they
call
the
reserve
trenchs
and
we
been
here
days
all
ready
and
have
got
to
stay
here
days
more
that
is
unless
they
should
something
happen
to
the
regt
that
up
ahead
of
us
in
the
front
line
and
if
they
get
smashed
up
or
something
and
half
to
be
sent
back
to
the
factory
then
we
will
jump
right
in
and
take
their
place
and
i
do
wish
them
no
bad
luck
but
i
wished
they
would
get
messed
up
tonight
at
lease
enough
so
as
they
would
half
to
come
out
for
repairs
but
it
do
look
like
they
was
much
chance
of
that
as
we
are
on
a
quite
section
where
they
has
been
nothing
doing
since
the
war
begin
you
might
say
but
of
course
jerry
is
raising
he
ll
all
over
the
front
now
and
here
is
where
he
will
probably
pick
on
next
and
believe
me
al
we
will
give
him
a
welcome
but
the
way
things
is
mapped
out
now
we
will
be
here
another
wk
yet
and
then
up
in
the
front
row
for
days
and
then
back
to
the
rest
billets
for
a
rest
but
they
say
the
only
thing
that
gets
a
rest
back
there
is
your
stomach
but
believe
me
your
stomach
gets
a
holiday
right
here
without
going
to
no
rest
billets
well
i
thought
they
would
be
some
excitement
up
here
but
its
like
church
but
everybody
says
just
wait
till
we
get
up
in
front
and
then
we
will
have
plenty
of
excitement
well
i
hope
they
are
telling
the
truth
because
its
sure
motonus
here
and
about
all
as
we
do
is
have
inspections
and
scratch
as
johnny
alcock
says
france
may
of
lose
a
whole
lot
of
men
in
this
war
but
they
do
seem
to
of
been
no
casualitys
amist
the
cuties
well
al
they
plenty
of
other
bugs
here
as
well
as
the
kinds
that
itchs
and
i
mean
some
of
the
boys
themselfs
and
here
is
where
it
comes
out
on
them
is
where
they
have
nothing
to
do
only
lay
around
and
they
bird
that
his
name
is
harry
friend
but
the
boys
calls
him
the
chicken
hawk
and
its
not
only
on
acct
of
him
loveing
the
ladys
but
he
is
all
the
wile
writeing
letters
to
them
and
he
is
of
these
fancy
writers
that
has
to
wind
up
before
he
comes
down
on
the
paper
with
a
word
and
between
every
word
he
sores
up
and
swoops
down
again
like
he
was
over
a
barn
yard
and
sometimes
the
boys
set
around
and
bets
on
how
many
wirls
he
will
take
before
he
will
get
within
writeing
distants
of
the
paper
well
any
way
he
must
get
a
whole
lot
of
letters
wrote
if
he
answers
all
the
ones
that
comes
for
him
because
every
time
you
bump
into
him
he
pulls
one
on
you
that
he
just
got
from
some
gal
that
nuts
about
him
somewheres
in
the
and
its
always
a
different
and
i
bet
the
stores
that
sells
service
stars
kept
open
evenings
the
wk
this
bird
enlisted
in
the
draft
but
today
it
was
a
french
gal
that
he
had
a
letter
from
her
some
dame
in
chalons
and
he
showed
me
her
picture
and
she
some
queen
al
and
he
is
pulling
for
us
to
be
sent
there
on
our
leave
after
we
serve
our
turn
up
here
and
i
do
blame
him
for
wanting
to
be
where
she
at
and
i
wished
they
was
some
baby
doll
that
i
could
pal
around
with
in
what
ever
burg
they
ship
us
to
but
i
do
know
nobody
al
and
besides
i
a
married
man
so
no
flirting
with
the
parley
vous
for
me
and
i
suppose
i
will
spend
most
of
my
time
with
the
vin
sisters
and
a
headache
your
pal
jack
illustration
every
time
you
bump
into
him
he
pulls
a
letter
on
you
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
i
was
talking
to
of
the
boys
jack
brady
today
and
we
was
talking
about
harry
friend
and
i
told
jack
about
him
getting
a
letter
from
this
french
girlie
at
chalons
and
how
he
was
pulling
for
us
to
go
there
on
our
leave
so
as
he
could
see
her
so
jack
said
he
did
think
we
would
go
there
but
they
would
probably
send
us
to
of
the
places
where
we
could
get
a
bath
as
god
knows
we
will
need
one
and
they
will
probably
send
us
to
aix
les
bains
or
nice
or
cologne
so
i
said
i
did
care
where
we
was
sent
as
they
would
be
no
gal
waiting
for
me
in
none
of
them
towns
so
jack
says
it
was
my
own
fault
if
they
was
as
all
these
places
was
full
of
girlies
that
was
there
for
us
to
dance
with
them
and
etc
and
the
officers
had
all
their
names
and
addresses
and
the
way
to
do
was
write
to
of
them
and
tell
her
when
you
was
comeing
and
would
she
like
to
show
you
around
and
he
said
he
would
see
of
the
lieuts
that
he
stands
pretty
good
with
him
and
see
what
he
could
do
for
me
well
al
i
told
him
to
go
ahead
as
i
thought
it
was
just
a
joke
but
sure
enough
he
showed
up
after
a
wile
and
he
said
the
lieut
did
only
have
name
left
but
she
was
a
queen
and
he
give
me
her
name
and
address
and
its
miss
marie
antoinette
rue
de
nez
rouge
cologne
well
al
i
did
have
nothing
else
to
do
so
i
set
down
and
wrote
her
a
note
and
i
will
coppy
down
what
i
wrote
miss
i
suppose
you
will
be
supprised
to
hear
from
me
and
i
hope
you
wo
think
i
am
some
fresh
bird
writeing
you
this
letter
for
a
joke
or
something
but
i
am
just
of
uncle
sam
soldiers
from
the
and
am
now
in
the
trenchs
fighting
for
your
country
well
miss
antoinette
we
expect
to
be
here
about
wks
more
and
then
we
will
have
a
leave
off
for
a
few
days
and
some
of
the
boys
thinks
we
may
spend
it
in
your
city
and
i
thought
maybe
you
might
be
good
enough
to
show
me
around
when
we
get
there
i
was
a
baseball
pitcher
back
in
the
tall
and
athletic
build
and
i
do
suppose
you
know
what
baseball
is
but
thought
maybe
you
would
wonder
what
i
look
like
well
if
you
are
busy
when
we
get
there
i
will
hope
to
see
you
and
if
you
are
agreeable
drop
me
a
line
here
and
i
will
sure
look
you
up
when
i
get
there
so
then
i
give
her
my
name
and
where
to
reach
me
and
of
course
they
nothing
come
out
of
it
al
only
a
man
has
got
to
amuse
yourself
some
way
in
a
dump
like
this
or
they
would
go
crazy
but
it
would
sure
be
a
horse
on
me
if
she
was
to
answer
the
letter
and
say
she
would
be
glad
to
see
me
and
then
of
course
i
would
half
to
write
and
tell
her
i
was
a
married
man
or
else
not
write
to
her
at
all
but
of
course
they
wo
nothing
come
out
of
it
and
its
a
good
bet
we
wo
never
see
cologne
as
that
was
just
a
guess
on
brady
part
well
al
things
is
going
along
about
like
usual
with
nothing
doing
only
inspections
and
etc
and
telling
us
how
to
behave
when
we
get
up
there
in
the
front
row
and
not
to
stick
our
head
over
the
top
in
the
day
time
and
you
would
think
we
was
the
home
guards
or
something
and
at
that
i
guess
the
home
guards
is
seeing
as
much
of
the
war
as
we
are
in
this
old
ditch
but
they
say
it
will
be
different
when
we
get
up
in
front
and
believe
me
i
hope
so
and
they
ca
send
us
there
to
soon
to
suit
me
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
here
we
are
up
in
the
front
line
trenchs
and
we
come
in
here
days
ahead
of
time
but
that
the
way
they
run
everything
in
the
army
except
feed
you
but
they
do
never
do
nothing
when
they
say
they
are
going
to
and
i
suppose
they
want
a
man
to
get
use
to
haveing
things
come
by
supprise
so
as
it
wo
interfere
with
your
plans
if
you
get
killed
a
couple
days
before
you
was
looking
for
it
well
al
we
are
looking
for
it
now
most
any
day
and
this
may
be
the
last
letter
you
will
ever
get
from
your
old
pal
and
you
may
think
i
am
kidding
when
i
say
that
but
of
the
boys
told
me
a
wile
ago
that
he
heard
capt
seeley
telling
of
the
lieuts
that
the
reason
we
come
in
here
ahead
of
time
was
on
acct
of
them
expecting
the
dutchmans
to
make
their
next
drive
on
this
section
and
the
birds
that
we
are
takeing
their
place
was
a
bunch
of
yellow
stiffs
that
was
hard
of
hearing
except
when
they
was
told
to
retreat
and
pershing
figured
that
if
they
was
up
here
when
jerry
made
a
attack
they
would
turn
around
and
open
up
a
drive
on
africa
and
the
bosh
has
been
going
through
the
rest
of
the
line
like
it
was
held
by
the
ladies
aid
and
foch
says
they
have
got
to
be
stopped
so
we
are
elected
al
and
you
know
what
that
means
and
it
means
we
ca
retreat
under
no
conditions
but
stay
here
till
we
get
killed
so
you
see
i
was
kidding
al
and
it
looks
like
it
was
only
a
question
of
a
few
days
or
maybe
not
that
long
but
at
that
i
guess
most
of
the
boys
would
just
as
leave
stop
a
dutch
bayonet
as
to
lay
around
in
this
he
ll
hole
believe
me
al
this
is
a
fine
resort
to
spend
days
at
what
with
the
mud
and
the
perfume
and
a
whole
menajery
useing
you
for
a
parade
grounds
well
capt
seeley
wants
us
to
get
all
the
rest
we
can
now
on
acct
of
what
comeing
off
after
a
wile
but
believe
me
i
am
not
going
to
oversleep
myself
in
this
he
ll
hole
because
suppose
jerry
would
pick
out
the
time
wile
you
was
asleep
to
come
over
and
pay
us
a
visit
and
they
supposed
to
be
some
of
the
boys
on
post
duty
to
watch
all
night
and
keep
their
eye
pealed
and
wake
us
up
if
they
something
stiring
but
i
have
been
in
hotels
a
lot
of
times
and
left
a
call
with
some
gal
that
did
have
nothing
to
do
only
pair
her
finger
nails
and
when
the
time
come
ring
me
up
but
even
at
that
she
forgot
it
so
what
chance
is
they
for
of
these
sentrys
to
remember
and
wake
everybody
up
when
maybe
they
or
dutchmens
divideing
him
into
building
lots
with
their
bayonet
or
something
so
as
far
as
i
am
conserned
i
will
try
and
keep
awake
wile
i
can
because
it
looks
like
when
we
do
go
to
sleep
we
will
stay
asleep
several
yrs
and
even
if
we
are
lucky
enough
to
get
back
to
them
rest
billets
we
can
sleep
till
the
cows
come
home
a
specially
if
they
give
us
some
more
of
them
entertainments
like
we
had
in
camp
well
al
before
we
got
here
i
thought
they
would
be
so
much
fireing
back
and
up
here
that
a
man
could
hear
themself
think
but
i
guess
jerry
is
saveing
up
for
the
big
show
though
every
little
wile
they
try
and
locate
our
batterys
and
clean
them
out
and
once
in
so
often
of
our
big
guns
replys
but
as
johnny
alcock
says
you
could
never
accuse
our
artillrys
from
being
to
gabby
and
i
guess
we
are
lucky
they
are
pretty
near
speechless
as
they
might
take
a
notion
to
fire
short
but
any
way
a
little
wile
ago
of
our
guns
sent
a
big
shell
over
and
johnny
says
what
and
the
he
ll
can
that
be
and
i
said
its
a
shell
from
of
our
guns
and
he
says
he
thought
they
fired
yesterday
well
as
i
say
here
we
are
with
days
of
it
stareing
us
in
the
eye
and
the
cuties
for
company
and
the
only
way
we
can
get
out
of
here
ahead
of
time
is
on
a
stretcher
and
i
would
mind
that
al
but
as
i
say
i
want
to
be
awake
when
my
time
comes
because
if
i
am
going
to
get
killed
in
this
war
i
want
to
have
some
idear
who
done
it
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
i
got
the
supprise
of
my
life
today
when
jack
brady
handed
me
a
letter
that
had
came
for
me
and
that
supprise
enough
itself
but
all
the
more
when
i
opened
it
up
and
seen
who
it
was
from
well
it
was
from
that
baby
in
cologne
and
i
will
coppy
it
down
as
it
is
short
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
she
says
well
here
it
is
your
letter
just
reached
me
and
you
can
bet
i
was
glad
to
get
it
i
sure
will
be
glad
to
see
you
when
you
come
to
cologne
and
i
will
be
more
than
glad
to
show
you
the
sights
this
is
some
town
and
we
sure
will
have
a
time
when
you
get
here
i
am
just
learning
to
write
english
so
please
excuse
mistakes
but
all
i
want
to
say
is
do
disappoint
me
but
write
when
you
will
come
so
i
can
be
all
dressed
up
comme
un
cheval
avec
und
kussen
marie
antoinette
you
see
al
they
part
of
it
wrote
in
french
and
that
last
part
means
with
love
and
kisses
well
i
guess
that
letter
i
wrote
her
must
have
went
over
strong
and
any
ways
it
looks
like
she
did
exactly
hate
me
eh
al
well
it
looks
like
i
would
half
to
write
to
her
back
and
tell
her
i
am
a
married
man
and
they
ca
be
no
flirting
between
her
and
i
but
if
she
wants
to
be
a
good
pal
and
show
me
around
and
no
harm
done
well
i
hope
she
takes
it
that
way
because
it
sure
will
seem
good
to
talk
to
a
gal
again
that
can
talk
a
little
english
and
not
la
la
la
all
the
wile
but
of
course
its
a
good
bet
that
i
wo
never
see
her
because
we
are
just
as
libel
to
go
somewheres
else
as
cologne
though
brady
seems
to
think
that
where
we
are
headed
for
well
time
will
tell
and
in
the
mean
wile
we
are
libel
to
get
blowed
to
he
ll
and
gone
and
then
of
course
it
would
be
good
by
sweet
marie
but
i
was
supprised
to
hear
from
her
as
i
only
wrote
to
her
in
fun
and
did
think
nothing
would
come
from
it
but
i
guess
harry
friend
the
only
lady
killer
in
the
army
and
if
i
was
of
the
kind
that
shows
off
all
their
letters
i
guess
i
have
got
now
to
show
a
side
from
all
that
al
we
was
supposed
to
have
our
chow
a
hr
ago
but
no
chow
and
some
of
the
boys
says
its
on
acct
of
our
back
arears
being
under
fire
and
you
see
the
kitchens
is
way
back
of
the
front
lines
and
the
boys
on
chow
detail
is
supposed
to
bring
our
food
up
here
but
when
the
back
arears
is
under
fire
they
are
scared
to
bring
it
up
or
they
might
maybe
run
into
some
bad
luck
on
the
way
how
is
that
for
fine
dope
al
when
a
whole
regt
starves
to
death
because
a
few
yellow
stiffs
is
afraid
that
maybe
a
shell
might
light
near
them
and
spill
a
few
beans
brady
says
maybe
they
are
trying
to
starve
us
so
as
we
will
get
mad
and
fight
harder
when
the
time
comes
like
in
the
old
days
when
they
use
to
have
fights
between
men
and
lions
in
reno
and
rome
and
for
days
ahead
they
would
give
the
lions
nothing
to
eat
so
as
they
would
be
pretty
near
wild
when
they
got
in
reno
and
would
make
a
rush
at
the
gladaters
that
was
supposed
to
fight
them
and
try
and
eat
them
up
on
acct
of
being
so
near
starved
well
al
i
would
half
to
be
good
and
hungry
before
i
would
want
to
eat
a
dutchman
a
specially
after
they
been
in
the
trenchs
a
wile
but
any
way
it
do
make
a
whole
lot
of
differents
if
the
chow
gets
here
or
not
because
when
it
comes
its
nothing
only
a
eye
dropper
full
of
soup
and
coffee
and
some
bread
that
i
would
hate
to
have
some
of
it
fall
on
my
toe
and
before
we
left
the
everybody
was
trying
to
preserve
food
so
as
the
boys
in
france
would
have
plenty
to
eat
but
if
they
sent
any
of
the
preserves
over
here
the
boat
they
come
on
must
of
stopped
a
torpedo
and
i
hope
the
young
mackerels
wo
make
themselfs
sick
on
sweets
jokeing
to
side
this
is
some
climate
al
and
they
do
never
a
day
pass
without
it
raining
and
i
use
to
think
the
weather
profits
back
home
had
a
snap
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
write
down
rain
or
snow
or
fair
and
even
if
they
was
wrong
they
was
way
up
there
where
you
could
get
at
them
but
they
have
got
a
tough
job
when
you
look
at
a
french
weather
profit
and
as
soon
as
he
learns
the
french
for
rain
he
can
open
up
an
office
and
he
half
to
hide
from
nobody
because
he
ca
never
go
wrong
though
alcock
says
they
have
got
a
dry
season
here
that
begins
the
of
july
and
ends
that
night
but
its
a
holiday
so
the
weather
profit
do
half
to
monkey
with
it
any
way
its
so
dark
here
all
the
wile
that
you
ca
hardly
tell
day
and
night
only
at
night
times
the
dutchmens
over
across
the
way
sends
up
a
flare
once
in
a
wile
to
light
things
up
so
as
they
can
see
if
any
of
us
prowling
around
nobody
land
and
speaking
about
nobody
land
brady
says
its
the
ground
that
lays
between
the
german
trenchs
and
the
vermin
trenchs
but
jokeing
to
side
if
it
was
for
these
here
flares
we
would
know
they
was
anybody
over
in
them
other
trenchs
and
when
we
come
in
here
they
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
jerry
sending
over
a
patrol
to
find
out
who
we
was
but
it
looks
like
he
was
interested
but
all
and
all
al
its
nothing
like
i
expected
up
here
and
all
we
have
seen
of
the
war
is
when
a
shell
or
busts
in
back
of
us
or
once
in
a
wile
of
their
areoplanes
comes
over
and
of
ours
chases
them
back
and
sometimes
they
have
a
battle
but
they
always
manage
to
finish
it
where
we
ca
see
it
for
the
fear
we
might
enjoy
ourselfs
well
it
looks
like
we
would
half
to
go
to
bed
on
a
empty
stomach
if
you
could
call
it
bed
and
speaking
about
stomach
brady
says
they
a
old
saying
that
a
army
travels
on
their
stomach
but
a
cutie
covers
a
whole
lot
more
ground
but
as
i
say
when
you
do
get
your
chow
you
do
miss
much
only
it
kills
a
little
time
and
everybody
is
sick
in
tired
of
doing
nothing
and
of
the
boys
was
saying
tonight
he
wished
the
dutchmens
would
attack
so
as
to
break
the
motley
and
alcock
said
that
if
they
did
attack
he
hoped
they
would
do
it
with
gas
as
his
nose
needed
a
change
of
air
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
old
pal
i
come
within
a
ace
you
might
say
of
not
being
here
to
write
you
this
letter
and
you
may
think
that
bunk
but
wait
till
you
hear
what
come
off
well
it
seems
our
scout
planes
brought
back
word
yesterday
that
the
dutch
regt
over
across
the
way
had
moved
out
and
another
regt
had
took
their
place
and
it
seems
when
they
make
a
change
like
that
our
gens
always
trys
to
find
out
who
the
new
rivals
is
so
the
orders
come
yesterday
that
we
was
to
get
up
a
patrol
party
for
last
night
and
go
over
and
take
a
few
prisoners
so
as
we
would
know
what
regt
we
was
up
well
as
soon
as
the
news
come
out
they
was
some
of
the
boys
volunteered
to
go
in
the
patrol
and
they
was
only
a
few
going
so
i
feel
like
noseing
myself
in
and
maybe
crowding
somebody
out
that
was
set
on
going
and
besides
what
and
the
he
ll
do
i
care
what
regt
is
there
as
long
as
its
germans
and
its
like
you
lived
in
a
flat
and
the
people
across
the
hall
moved
out
and
some
people
moved
in
why
as
long
as
you
knowed
they
was
friends
of
yours
you
would
rush
over
and
ring
their
door
bell
and
say
who
the
he
ll
are
you
but
you
would
wait
till
they
had
time
to
get
some
cards
printed
and
stick
in
the
mail
box
so
its
like
i
told
alcock
that
when
the
boys
come
back
they
would
tell
the
that
the
people
opp
us
was
germans
and
the
would
be
supprised
because
he
probably
thought
all
the
wile
that
they
was
the
idaho
boy
scouts
or
something
but
at
that
i
pretty
near
made
up
my
mind
at
the
last
minute
to
volunteer
just
to
break
the
motley
you
might
say
but
it
was
to
late
and
i
lost
out
well
al
the
boys
that
went
did
come
back
and
i
hope
the
is
satisfied
now
because
he
has
lost
that
many
men
and
he
knows
just
as
much
as
he
did
before
namely
that
they
some
germans
across
the
way
and
either
they
killed
our
whole
bunch
or
took
them
a
prisoner
and
instead
of
us
learning
who
they
are
they
found
out
who
we
are
because
the
boys
gone
is
all
from
our
regt
and
its
just
like
as
if
we
went
over
and
give
them
the
information
they
wanted
to
save
them
the
trouble
of
comeing
over
here
and
getting
it
well
it
do
make
a
man
feel
any
happier
to
think
about
them
poor
boys
and
god
only
knows
what
happened
to
them
if
they
are
prisoners
or
dead
and
some
of
them
was
pals
of
mine
to
but
the
worst
part
of
it
is
that
the
word
will
be
sent
home
that
they
are
missing
in
actions
and
their
wifes
wo
know
what
become
of
them
if
they
got
any
and
i
ca
help
from
thinking
i
might
of
been
with
them
only
for
not
wanting
to
crowd
somebody
out
and
if
i
had
of
went
my
name
would
be
in
the
casuality
list
as
missing
in
actions
but
i
guess
at
that
if
florrie
picked
up
the
paper
and
seen
it
she
would
know
it
was
her
husband
its
so
long
since
she
wrote
it
on
a
envelop
well
al
they
other
gals
in
the
world
besides
florrie
and
of
course
its
to
late
to
get
serious
with
them
when
a
man
has
got
a
wife
and
kid
but
believe
me
i
am
going
to
enjoy
myself
if
they
happen
to
pick
out
cologne
to
send
us
to
and
if
the
little
gal
down
there
is
of
the
kind
that
can
be
good
pals
with
a
man
without
looseing
her
head
over
me
i
will
sure
have
a
good
time
but
i
suppose
when
she
sees
me
she
will
want
to
begin
flirting
or
something
and
then
i
will
half
to
pass
her
up
before
anybody
gets
hurt
well
any
way
i
wrote
her
a
friendly
letter
today
and
just
told
her
to
keep
me
in
mind
and
i
stuck
a
few
french
words
in
it
for
a
gag
but
i
will
coppy
down
what
i
wrote
the
best
i
can
remember
it
so
you
will
know
what
i
wrote
here
it
is
cher
your
note
recd
and
you
can
bet
i
was
mighty
glad
to
hear
from
you
and
learn
you
would
show
me
around
cologne
that
is
if
they
send
us
there
and
if
we
get
out
of
here
alive
well
you
said
you
was
just
learning
english
well
i
will
maybe
be
able
to
help
you
along
and
you
can
maybe
help
me
with
the
french
so
you
see
it
will
be
well
i
sure
hope
they
send
us
to
cologne
and
i
will
let
you
know
the
minute
i
find
out
where
they
are
going
to
send
us
and
maybe
even
if
its
somewheres
else
you
visit
there
at
the
same
time
and
maybe
i
could
see
you
well
girlie
we
will
be
out
of
here
in
less
then
a
wk
now
if
we
do
have
no
bad
luck
and
you
can
bet
i
wo
waist
no
time
getting
to
where
ever
they
send
us
and
i
hope
its
cologne
so
in
the
mean
wile
do
take
no
wood
nickles
and
get
impatient
but
be
a
good
girlie
and
save
up
your
loving
for
me
tres
beaucoup
from
your
sammy
boy
jack
keefe
that
what
i
wrote
her
al
and
i
bet
she
ca
hardly
wait
to
hear
if
comeing
or
not
but
i
do
suppose
they
any
chance
of
them
sending
us
there
and
a
specially
if
they
find
out
that
anybody
wants
to
go
there
but
maybe
she
can
fix
it
to
meet
me
somewheres
else
and
any
ways
they
wo
be
no
lifes
lost
if
i
never
see
her
and
maybe
it
would
be
better
that
way
but
a
man
has
got
to
write
letters
or
do
something
to
keep
your
mind
off
what
happened
to
them
poor
birds
that
went
in
the
patrol
and
a
specially
when
i
come
so
near
being
of
them
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
if
i
am
still
alive
yet
its
not
because
i
laid
back
and
did
take
no
chances
and
i
wished
some
of
the
baseball
boys
that
use
to
call
me
yellow
when
i
was
in
there
pitching
had
of
seen
me
last
night
and
i
guess
they
would
of
sang
a
different
song
only
in
the
place
i
was
where
they
could
nobody
see
me
and
secondly
they
would
of
been
so
scared
they
would
of
choked
to
death
if
they
tried
to
talk
let
alone
sing
but
wait
till
you
hear
about
it
well
yesterday
sargent
crane
asked
me
how
i
liked
life
in
the
trenchs
and
i
said
only
i
got
tired
on
acct
of
they
not
being
no
excitement
or
nothing
to
do
and
he
says
oh
they
plenty
to
do
and
i
could
go
out
and
help
the
boys
fix
up
the
bob
wire
in
front
of
the
trenchs
like
we
done
back
in
the
training
camp
so
i
said
i
did
see
how
they
could
be
any
fixing
needed
as
they
had
nothing
happened
on
this
section
since
the
war
started
you
might
say
and
the
birds
that
was
here
before
us
had
plenty
of
time
to
fix
it
if
it
needed
fixing
so
he
says
well
any
ways
no
excitement
to
fixing
the
wire
but
if
you
was
looking
for
excitement
why
did
you
go
with
that
patrol
the
other
night
so
i
said
because
i
did
see
no
sence
to
trying
to
find
out
who
was
in
the
other
trenchs
when
we
know
they
are
germans
and
that
all
we
need
to
know
wait
till
they
a
real
job
and
you
wo
see
me
hideing
behind
nobody
so
he
says
i
got
a
real
job
for
you
tonight
and
you
can
go
along
with
ted
phillips
to
the
listening
post
well
al
a
listening
post
is
what
they
call
a
little
place
they
got
dug
out
way
over
near
the
german
trenchs
and
its
so
close
you
can
hear
them
talk
sometimes
and
you
are
supposed
to
hear
if
they
are
getting
ready
to
pull
something
and
report
back
here
so
as
they
wo
catch
us
asleep
well
i
was
wild
to
go
just
for
something
to
do
but
i
been
haveing
trouble
with
my
ears
lately
probably
on
acct
of
the
noise
from
so
much
shell
fire
or
something
but
any
ways
i
have
thought
a
couple
times
that
i
was
getting
a
little
deef
so
i
thought
i
better
tell
him
the
truth
so
i
said
i
would
be
tickled
to
death
to
go
only
i
do
know
if
i
ought
to
or
not
because
i
do
hear
very
good
even
in
english
and
of
course
jerry
would
be
telling
their
plans
in
german
and
suppose
i
did
catch
on
to
it
and
i
would
feel
like
a
murder
if
they
started
a
big
drive
and
i
had
gave
my
pals
no
warning
so
he
says
do
worry
about
that
as
phillips
has
got
good
ears
and
understands
german
and
he
has
been
there
before
only
in
a
job
like
that
a
man
wants
company
and
you
are
going
along
for
company
well
before
we
snuck
out
there
sargent
crane
called
us
to
side
and
says
you
boys
is
takeing
a
big
chance
and
phillips
knows
what
to
do
but
you
want
to
remember
keefe
to
keep
quite
and
not
make
no
noise
or
talk
to
each
other
because
if
jerry
finds
out
you
are
there
we
probably
wo
see
you
again
well
al
it
finely
come
time
for
us
to
go
and
we
went
and
if
anybody
asks
you
how
to
spend
a
pleasant
evening
do
steer
them
up
against
a
listening
post
with
a
crazy
man
well
i
suppose
you
think
its
pretty
quite
there
at
home
nights
and
i
use
to
think
so
to
but
believe
me
al
bedford
at
in
the
is
a
bowling
alley
along
the
side
of
of
these
here
listening
posts
it
may
sound
funny
but
i
would
of
gave
a
month
pay
if
somebody
would
of
shot
off
a
fire
cracker
or
anything
to
make
a
noise
there
was
the
bosh
trench
about
yds
from
us
but
not
a
sound
out
of
them
and
a
man
could
help
from
thinking
what
if
they
had
of
heard
us
out
there
and
they
was
getting
ready
to
snoop
up
on
us
and
that
why
they
was
keeping
so
still
and
it
got
so
as
i
could
feel
of
their
bayonets
burrowing
into
me
and
i
am
no
quitter
al
when
it
comes
to
fighting
somebody
you
can
see
but
when
you
have
got
a
idear
that
somebody
is
cralling
up
on
you
and
you
have
no
chance
to
fight
back
i
would
like
to
see
the
bird
that
could
enjoy
themself
and
besides
suppose
my
ears
had
went
back
on
me
worse
then
i
thought
and
the
dutchmens
was
realy
makeing
a
he
ll
of
a
racket
but
i
could
hear
them
and
maybe
they
was
getting
ready
to
come
over
the
top
and
i
would
know
the
differents
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
would
lay
a
garage
and
dash
out
behind
it
and
if
they
did
kill
us
we
would
be
up
in
front
of
the
court
marshal
for
not
warning
our
pals
well
as
i
say
i
would
of
gave
anything
for
some
one
to
of
fired
off
a
gun
or
made
some
noise
of
some
kind
but
when
this
here
phillips
finely
opened
up
his
clam
and
spoke
i
would
of
jumped
a
mile
if
they
had
of
been
any
room
to
jump
anywheres
well
the
sargent
had
told
us
not
to
say
nothing
but
all
of
a
sudden
right
out
loud
this
bird
says
this
is
a
he
ll
of
a
war
well
i
motioned
back
at
him
to
shut
up
but
of
course
he
could
see
me
and
he
thought
i
had
heard
what
he
said
so
he
said
it
over
again
so
then
i
thought
maybe
he
had
heard
the
sargent
orders
so
i
whispered
to
him
that
he
was
supposed
to
talk
well
al
they
was
no
way
of
keeping
him
quite
and
he
says
that
all
bunk
because
i
been
out
here
before
and
talked
my
head
off
and
nothing
happened
so
i
says
well
if
you
have
got
to
talk
you
do
half
to
yell
it
so
then
he
tried
to
whisper
al
but
his
whisper
sounded
like
a
jazz
record
with
a
crack
in
it
so
he
says
i
not
yelling
i
am
whispering
so
i
said
yes
i
have
heard
hughey
jennings
whisper
like
that
out
on
the
lines
so
he
shut
up
for
a
wile
but
pretty
soon
he
busted
out
again
and
this
time
he
was
louder
then
ever
and
he
asked
me
could
i
sing
and
i
said
no
i
could
so
then
he
says
well
you
can
holler
ca
you
so
i
said
i
suppose
i
could
so
he
says
well
i
know
how
we
could
play
a
big
joke
on
them
square
heads
lets
the
both
of
us
begin
yelling
like
a
indian
and
they
will
hear
us
and
they
will
think
they
a
whole
crowd
of
us
here
and
they
will
begin
bombing
us
or
something
and
think
they
are
going
to
kill
a
whole
crowd
of
americans
but
it
will
only
be
us
and
we
can
give
them
the
laugh
for
waisting
their
ammunitions
well
al
i
seen
then
that
i
was
parked
there
with
a
crazy
man
and
for
a
wile
i
did
say
nothing
because
i
was
scared
that
i
might
say
something
that
would
encourage
him
some
way
so
i
just
shut
up
and
finely
he
says
what
is
the
matter
ai
you
going
to
join
me
so
i
said
i
will
join
you
in
the
jaw
in
a
minute
if
you
do
shut
your
mouth
and
then
he
quited
down
a
little
but
every
few
minutes
he
would
have
another
swell
idear
and
once
he
asked
me
could
i
imitate
animals
and
i
said
no
so
he
says
he
could
mew
like
a
cow
and
he
had
heard
the
boshs
was
so
hard
up
for
food
and
they
would
rush
out
here
thinking
they
was
going
to
find
a
cow
but
it
would
be
no
cow
but
it
would
be
a
horse
on
them
well
you
can
imagine
what
i
went
through
out
there
with
a
bird
like
that
and
i
thought
more
then
once
i
would
catch
it
from
him
and
go
nuts
myself
but
i
managed
to
keep
a
hold
of
myself
and
the
happiest
minute
of
my
life
was
when
it
was
time
for
us
to
crall
back
in
our
dug
outs
but
at
that
i
ca
remember
how
we
got
back
here
this
sargent
crane
asked
me
what
kind
of
a
time
did
we
have
and
i
told
him
and
i
told
him
this
here
phillips
was
squirrel
meat
and
he
says
phillips
is
just
as
sane
as
anybody
usualy
only
everybody
that
went
out
on
the
listening
post
was
effected
that
way
by
the
quite
and
its
a
wonder
i
did
go
nuts
to
well
its
a
wonder
i
did
al
and
its
a
good
thing
i
kept
my
head
and
kept
him
from
playing
of
those
tricks
as
god
knows
what
would
of
happened
and
the
entire
regt
might
of
been
wipped
out
but
i
hope
they
do
wish
no
more
listening
post
on
me
but
if
they
do
you
can
bet
i
will
pick
my
own
pardner
and
it
wo
be
no
nut
and
no
matter
what
sargent
crane
says
if
this
here
phillips
is
sane
we
stopping
at
palm
beach
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
old
pal
do
say
nothing
about
this
not
even
to
bertha
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
as
some
people
might
not
understand
and
a
specially
a
woman
and
might
maybe
think
i
was
acting
right
towards
florrie
or
something
though
when
a
man
is
married
to
a
woman
that
he
has
been
in
france
pretty
near
mos
and
she
has
wrote
him
letters
i
see
where
she
would
have
a
sqawk
comeing
at
whatever
i
done
but
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
do
nothing
that
i
would
just
as
leave
tell
her
about
it
only
i
want
to
tell
her
myself
and
when
i
get
a
good
ready
well
i
guess
i
told
you
we
was
only
supposed
to
stay
here
in
the
front
line
days
and
then
they
will
somebody
come
and
releive
us
and
take
our
place
and
then
we
go
to
the
rest
billets
somewheres
and
lay
around
till
its
our
turn
to
come
up
here
again
well
al
we
been
in
the
front
line
now
eight
days
and
that
means
we
wo
only
be
here
days
more
so
probably
we
will
get
out
of
here
the
day
after
tomorrow
night
well
up
to
today
we
have
no
idear
where
we
was
going
to
get
sent
as
they
several
places
where
the
boys
can
go
on
leave
like
aix
le
bains
and
nice
and
etc
and
we
know
which
it
would
be
so
today
we
was
talking
about
it
and
i
said
i
wished
i
knew
for
sure
and
jack
brady
stands
pretty
good
with
of
the
lieuts
so
he
says
he
would
ask
him
right
out
so
he
went
and
asked
him
and
the
lieut
told
him
cologne
well
al
i
had
no
sooner
found
out
when
of
the
boys
hands
me
a
letter
that
just
come
and
it
was
a
letter
from
this
baby
doll
that
i
told
you
about
that
in
cologne
and
i
will
coppy
down
the
letter
so
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
she
says
and
here
it
is
al
sammy
i
was
tres
beaucoup
to
get
your
letter
and
will
sure
be
glad
to
see
you
and
can
hardly
wait
till
you
get
here
do
let
them
send
you
anywhere
else
as
cologne
is
the
prettiest
town
in
france
and
the
liveliest
and
we
will
sure
have
some
time
going
to
shows
etc
and
i
hope
you
bring
along
beaucoup
francs
well
i
have
time
to
write
you
much
of
a
letter
as
i
have
got
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
the
dressmaker
you
see
i
am
getting
all
dolled
up
for
my
sammy
boy
but
be
sure
and
let
me
know
when
you
are
going
to
get
here
and
when
you
reach
cologne
jump
right
in
a
noir
et
blanc
taxi
and
come
up
to
the
house
you
know
the
number
so
come
along
sammy
and
make
it
toot
sweet
yours
with
tres
beaucoup
marie
so
that
her
letter
al
and
it
looks
like
i
was
going
to
be
in
right
in
old
cologne
and
it
sure
does
look
like
fate
was
takeing
a
hand
in
the
game
when
things
breaks
this
way
and
when
i
wrote
to
this
gal
the
first
time
i
did
have
no
idear
of
ever
seeing
her
but
the
way
things
is
turning
out
it
almost
seems
like
we
was
meant
to
meet
each
other
well
al
i
only
hope
she
has
got
some
sence
and
wo
get
to
likeing
me
to
well
or
of
course
all
bets
is
off
but
if
we
can
just
be
good
pals
and
go
around
to
shows
etc
together
i
do
see
where
i
will
be
doing
anything
out
of
the
way
only
as
i
say
do
say
nothing
about
it
to
bertha
or
nobody
else
as
people
is
libel
to
not
understand
and
i
guess
most
of
them
women
back
in
the
thinks
that
when
a
man
has
been
up
at
the
front
as
long
as
we
have
and
then
when
he
gets
a
few
days
leave
he
ought
to
take
a
running
hop
step
and
jump
to
the
nearest
phonograph
and
put
on
a
rodeheaver
record
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
just
a
line
and
it
will
probably
be
the
last
time
i
will
write
you
from
the
trenchs
for
a
wile
as
our
time
is
up
tomorrow
night
and
the
next
time
i
write
you
it
will
probably
be
from
cologne
and
i
will
tell
you
what
kind
of
a
time
they
show
us
there
and
all
about
it
i
just
got
through
writeing
a
note
to
the
little
gal
there
telling
her
i
would
get
there
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
could
tell
her
when
that
would
be
as
i
do
know
how
far
it
is
or
how
we
get
there
but
brady
said
he
thought
it
was
about
miles
so
i
suppose
they
will
make
us
walk
well
talk
about
a
quite
section
and
they
has
even
been
a
gun
went
off
all
day
or
no
areoplanes
or
nothing
and
here
we
thought
we
was
going
to
see
a
whole
lot
of
excitement
and
we
have
fired
a
shot
or
throwed
a
grenade
or
even
saw
a
german
all
the
wile
we
was
here
and
we
are
just
like
when
we
come
only
for
those
poor
birds
that
went
on
that
wild
goose
chase
and
did
come
back
and
they
been
some
talk
about
sending
another
patrol
over
to
get
revenge
for
those
poor
boys
but
i
guess
they
wo
nothing
come
of
it
it
would
be
like
sending
good
money
after
bad
is
the
way
i
look
at
it
several
of
the
boys
has
been
calling
me
sammy
boy
today
and
i
signed
my
name
that
way
in
of
the
notes
i
wrote
that
little
gal
and
i
suppose
who
ever
censored
it
told
some
of
the
boys
about
it
and
now
they
are
trying
to
kid
me
well
al
i
do
see
where
a
censor
has
got
any
license
to
spill
stuff
like
that
but
they
no
harm
done
and
they
can
laugh
at
me
all
they
want
to
wile
we
are
here
as
i
will
be
the
that
does
the
laughing
when
we
get
to
cologne
and
i
guess
a
whole
lot
of
them
will
wish
they
was
this
same
sammy
boy
when
they
see
me
paradeing
up
and
down
the
blvd
with
the
bell
of
the
ball
o
you
sweet
marie
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
its
all
off
and
we
are
here
yet
and
what
is
more
we
are
libel
to
be
here
till
the
duration
of
the
war
if
we
do
get
killed
and
believe
me
i
would
welcome
death
rather
then
stay
in
this
he
ll
hole
another
days
and
from
now
on
i
am
going
to
take
all
the
chances
they
is
to
take
and
the
sooner
they
finish
me
i
will
be
glad
of
it
and
it
looks
like
it
might
come
tonight
al
as
i
have
volunteered
to
go
along
with
the
patrol
that
going
over
and
try
and
get
even
for
what
they
done
to
our
pals
well
old
pal
it
was
understood
when
we
come
up
here
that
we
would
be
here
days
and
yesterday
was
the
day
we
was
here
well
i
happened
to
say
something
yesterday
to
sargent
crane
about
what
time
was
we
going
and
he
says
where
to
and
i
said
i
thought
our
time
was
up
and
we
was
going
to
get
releived
so
he
says
who
is
going
to
releive
us
and
what
and
the
he
ll
do
you
want
to
be
releived
of
so
i
said
i
understood
they
did
only
keep
a
regt
in
the
front
line
days
and
then
took
them
out
and
sent
them
to
a
rest
billet
somewheres
so
he
says
what
do
you
call
this
but
a
rest
billet
so
then
i
asked
him
how
long
we
had
to
stay
here
and
he
said
well
it
may
be
a
day
or
it
may
be
all
summer
but
if
we
get
ordered
out
in
a
hurry
it
wo
be
to
go
to
no
rest
billet
but
it
will
be
to
go
up
to
where
they
are
fighting
the
war
so
i
made
the
remark
that
i
wished
somebody
had
of
tipped
me
off
as
i
had
fixed
up
a
kind
of
a
date
thinking
we
would
be
through
here
in
days
so
he
asked
me
where
my
date
was
at
and
i
said
cologne
so
then
he
kind
of
smiled
and
said
o
and
when
was
you
planing
to
start
so
i
said
i
was
figureing
on
starting
tonight
so
he
waited
a
minute
and
then
he
said
well
i
do
know
if
i
can
fix
it
for
you
tonight
or
tomorrow
night
but
they
some
of
the
boys
going
to
start
in
that
direction
one
of
them
times
and
i
guess
you
can
go
along
well
al
i
suppose
alcock
and
brady
and
them
has
been
playing
another
of
their
gags
on
me
and
i
hope
they
enjoyed
it
and
as
far
as
i
am
conserned
they
no
harm
done
cologne
al
is
way
back
of
the
german
lines
and
when
sargent
crane
said
they
was
some
of
the
boys
starting
in
that
direction
he
meant
this
here
patrol
so
i
in
on
it
al
and
they
did
go
last
night
but
tonight
the
big
night
and
some
of
the
boys
is
calling
me
sammy
boy
and
trying
to
make
a
monkey
out
of
me
but
the
smart
alex
that
doing
it
is
none
of
them
going
along
on
this
raid
and
that
just
what
a
man
would
expect
from
them
because
they
a
few
of
us
al
that
come
across
the
old
puddle
to
fight
and
the
rest
of
them
thinks
they
are
at
the
young
peoples
picnic
your
pal
jack
chapter
vi
simple
simon
the
trenchs
may
friend
al
well
al
we
have
been
haveing
a
lot
of
fun
with
a
bird
name
jack
simon
only
the
boys
calls
him
simple
simon
and
if
you
seen
him
you
ask
why
because
you
would
know
why
as
soon
as
you
seen
him
without
asking
why
as
he
keeps
his
mouth
open
all
the
wile
so
as
he
will
be
ready
to
swallow
whatever
you
tell
him
as
you
can
tell
him
anything
and
he
eats
it
up
so
the
boys
has
been
stuffing
him
full
of
storys
of
all
kinds
and
he
eats
them
all
up
and
you
could
tell
him
the
reason
they
had
the
bob
wire
out
in
front
was
to
scratch
yourself
on
it
when
the
cuties
was
useing
you
for
a
race
track
and
he
would
eat
it
up
well
when
we
come
in
here
and
took
over
this
section
this
bird
was
sick
and
i
do
know
what
ailed
him
only
it
could
of
been
brain
fever
but
any
way
he
did
join
us
in
here
till
the
day
before
yesterday
but
ever
since
he
joined
us
the
boys
has
been
stuffing
him
full
and
enjoying
themself
at
his
expenses
well
the
thing
he
asked
me
was
if
we
had
saw
any
actions
since
we
been
here
and
i
told
him
about
a
raid
we
was
on
the
other
night
before
he
come
and
we
layed
down
a
garage
and
then
snuck
over
to
the
german
trenchs
and
jumped
into
them
trying
to
get
a
hold
of
some
prisoners
but
we
could
find
head
or
tale
of
no
germans
where
our
bunch
jumped
in
as
they
had
ducked
and
hid
somewheres
when
they
found
out
we
was
comeing
so
he
says
he
wished
he
could
of
been
along
as
he
might
of
picked
up
some
souvenirs
over
in
their
trenchs
that
of
his
bugs
al
is
getting
souvenirs
as
he
is
of
these
here
souvenir
hounds
that
it
do
make
no
differents
to
him
who
wins
the
war
as
long
as
he
can
get
a
ship
load
of
junk
to
carry
it
back
home
and
show
it
off
so
i
told
johnny
alcock
and
some
of
the
other
boys
about
simon
wishing
he
could
of
got
some
souvenirs
so
they
framed
up
on
him
and
begin
selling
him
junk
that
they
told
him
they
had
picked
it
up
over
in
the
german
trenchs
and
alcock
blowed
some
cigarette
smoke
in
a
bottle
and
corked
it
up
and
told
him
it
was
german
tear
gas
and
simon
give
him
franks
for
it
and
jack
brady
showed
him
a
couple
of
laths
tied
together
with
a
peace
of
wire
and
told
him
it
was
a
part
of
the
areoplane
that
belonged
to
guy
meyer
the
french
ace
that
brought
down
so
many
dutchmans
before
they
finely
got
him
and
brady
said
he
hated
to
part
with
it
as
he
had
took
it
off
a
german
prisoner
that
he
brought
in
but
if
simon
thought
it
was
worth
franks
he
could
have
it
so
simon
bought
it
of
him
and
wanted
to
know
all
about
how
brady
come
to
get
the
prisoner
and
of
course
brady
had
to
make
it
up
as
we
have
saw
a
german
let
alone
take
them
a
prisoner
since
we
was
back
in
the
training
arears
and
would
know
they
was
any
only
for
their
artillery
and
throwing
up
rockets
at
night
and
snipping
at
a
man
every
time
you
go
out
on
a
wire
party
or
something
but
any
way
simon
eats
it
up
whatever
you
pull
on
him
and
some
times
i
feel
sorry
for
him
and
feel
like
tipping
him
off
but
the
boys
fun
would
be
spoiled
and
believe
me
they
need
some
kind
of
sport
up
here
or
pretty
soon
we
would
all
be
worse
off
then
simon
and
we
would
be
running
around
fomenting
at
the
mouth
well
al
i
wished
you
would
write
once
in
a
wile
if
its
only
a
line
as
a
man
likes
to
get
mail
once
in
a
wile
and
i
have
heard
from
florrie
for
pretty
near
a
month
and
then
all
as
she
said
was
that
the
reason
she
had
wrote
was
because
she
was
feeling
the
best
and
i
suppose
she
got
something
in
her
eye
but
anything
for
an
excuse
to
not
write
and
you
would
think
i
had
stepped
outdoors
to
wash
the
windows
instead
of
being
away
from
her
since
last
december
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
june
friend
al
well
al
nothing
doing
as
usual
only
patching
things
up
once
in
a
wile
and
it
would
be
as
safe
here
as
picking
your
teeth
if
our
artillery
had
a
few
brains
as
the
germans
would
never
pay
no
tension
to
us
if
our
batterys
would
lay
off
them
but
we
do
no
sooner
get
a
quite
spell
when
our
guns
cuts
loose
and
remind
fritz
that
they
a
war
and
then
of
course
the
dutchmens
has
got
to
pay
for
their
board
some
way
and
they
raise
he
ll
for
a
wile
and
make
everybody
cross
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
they
nobody
never
get
killed
on
side
or
the
other
side
but
of
course
the
shells
mess
things
up
and
keeps
the
boys
busy
makeing
repairs
where
if
our
artillery
would
keep
their
mouth
shut
why
so
would
theirs
and
the
boys
would
never
half
to
leave
their
dice
game
only
for
chow
but
from
all
as
we
hear
i
guess
they
no
dice
game
going
on
up
on
some
of
the
other
sections
but
they
another
kind
of
a
game
going
on
up
there
and
so
far
the
dutchmens
has
got
all
the
best
of
it
but
some
of
the
boys
says
wait
till
the
allys
gets
ready
to
strike
back
and
they
will
make
them
look
like
a
sucker
and
the
best
way
to
do
is
wait
till
the
other
side
has
wore
themself
out
before
you
go
back
at
them
well
i
told
them
i
have
had
a
lot
of
experience
in
big
league
baseball
where
they
stragety
the
same
like
in
war
but
i
never
heard
none
of
the
big
league
managers
tell
their
boys
to
not
try
and
score
till
the
other
side
had
all
the
runs
they
was
going
to
get
and
further
and
more
it
looked
to
me
like
when
the
germans
did
get
wore
out
they
could
rest
up
again
in
the
best
hotel
in
paris
so
johnny
alcock
says
oh
they
wo
never
get
inside
of
paris
because
the
military
police
will
stop
them
at
the
city
limits
and
ask
them
for
their
pass
and
then
where
would
they
be
so
i
says
tell
that
to
simple
simon
and
he
shut
up
speaking
about
simple
simon
what
do
you
think
they
have
got
him
believeing
now
well
they
told
him
capt
seeley
had
sent
a
patrol
over
the
other
night
to
find
out
what
ailed
the
germans
that
they
never
showed
themself
or
started
nothing
against
us
and
the
patrol
found
out
that
van
hindenburg
had
took
all
the
men
out
of
the
section
opp
us
and
sent
them
up
to
the
war
and
left
the
trenchs
opp
us
empty
so
simon
asked
him
why
we
did
go
over
there
and
take
them
then
and
they
told
him
because
our
trenchs
was
warmer
on
acct
of
being
farther
south
i
suppose
they
will
be
telling
him
the
next
thing
that
capt
seeley
and
ludendorf
married
sisters
and
the
of
them
has
agreed
to
lay
off
each
other
well
al
i
am
glad
they
have
got
somebody
else
to
pick
on
besides
me
and
of
course
they
can
have
a
lot
more
fun
with
simon
as
they
nothing
to
raw
that
he
wo
eat
it
up
wile
in
my
case
i
was
to
smart
for
them
and
just
pretended
like
i
fell
for
their
gags
as
they
would
of
been
disappointed
if
i
had
of
and
as
i
say
somebody
has
got
to
furnish
amusement
in
a
he
ll
hole
like
this
or
we
would
all
be
squirrel
meat
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
june
friend
al
well
al
here
is
a
hot
that
they
pulled
on
this
simon
bird
today
and
it
was
all
as
i
could
do
to
help
from
busting
out
laughing
while
they
was
telling
it
to
him
well
it
seems
like
he
must
of
been
thinking
that
over
what
they
told
him
about
they
not
being
no
germans
in
the
trenchs
over
opp
to
where
we
are
at
and
it
finely
downed
on
him
that
if
they
was
nobody
over
there
why
who
was
throwing
up
them
flares
and
rockets
every
night
so
today
he
said
to
brady
he
says
did
you
birds
tell
me
them
trenchs
over
across
the
way
was
empty
so
brady
says
yes
what
of
it
so
simon
says
well
i
notice
they
somebody
over
there
at
night
times
or
else
who
throws
up
them
flares
as
they
do
throw
themselfs
up
so
brady
says
they
had
probably
left
a
flare
thrower
over
there
to
do
that
for
them
but
simon
says
they
must
of
left
a
lot
of
flare
throwers
because
the
flares
come
from
different
places
along
the
line
so
then
alcock
cut
in
and
says
yes
but
you
will
notice
they
do
come
from
different
places
at
once
and
the
bird
that
throws
them
gos
from
place
to
another
so
as
we
will
think
the
trenchs
is
full
of
germans
so
simon
says
they
could
nobody
go
from
place
to
another
place
as
fast
as
them
flares
shoots
up
from
different
places
so
alcock
says
no
they
could
nobody
do
it
if
they
walked
but
the
man
that
throws
them
flares
do
walk
because
he
has
got
only
leg
as
his
other
leg
was
shot
off
early
in
the
war
but
van
hindenburg
is
so
hard
up
for
men
that
even
if
you
get
a
leg
shot
off
as
soon
as
the
mops
up
the
mess
and
sticks
on
the
court
plaster
they
send
the
bird
back
in
the
war
and
put
him
on
a
job
where
you
do
half
to
walk
so
they
stuck
this
old
guy
in
the
motorcycle
dept
and
now
all
as
he
does
is
ride
up
and
down
some
quite
section
like
this
here
all
night
and
stop
every
so
often
and
throw
up
a
flare
to
make
us
think
the
place
is
dirty
with
germans
well
al
simon
thought
it
over
a
wile
and
then
asked
alcock
how
a
man
could
ride
a
motorcycle
with
only
leg
and
alcock
says
why
not
because
you
do
half
to
peddle
a
motorcycle
as
they
run
themself
so
simon
says
yes
but
how
about
it
when
you
want
to
get
off
so
alcock
says
what
has
a
legs
got
to
do
with
him
getting
off
of
a
motorcycle
as
long
as
you
have
got
your
head
to
light
on
that
is
what
they
handed
him
al
and
they
had
hardly
no
sooner
then
got
through
with
that
dose
when
brady
begun
on
the
souvenirs
first
he
asked
him
if
he
had
got
a
hold
of
any
new
ones
lately
and
simon
says
no
he
seen
nobody
that
had
any
for
sale
and
besides
his
jack
was
low
so
brady
asked
him
how
much
did
he
have
and
he
says
about
franks
so
brady
says
well
you
ca
expect
anybody
to
come
across
with
anything
first
class
for
no
such
chicken
food
as
that
so
simon
says
well
even
if
he
had
a
pocket
full
of
jack
he
could
buy
nothing
with
it
when
they
was
nothing
to
buy
then
brady
asked
him
if
he
had
saw
the
german
speegle
ted
phillips
had
picked
up
and
simon
says
no
so
brady
went
and
got
phillips
and
after
a
wile
he
come
back
with
him
and
phillips
said
he
had
the
speegle
in
his
pocket
and
he
would
show
it
to
us
if
we
promised
to
be
carefull
and
not
jar
it
out
of
his
hands
wile
he
was
showing
it
as
he
would
have
it
broke
for
the
world
so
simon
stood
there
with
his
eyes
popping
out
and
phillips
pulled
the
speegle
out
of
his
pocket
and
it
was
nothing
only
a
dirty
little
looking
glass
that
you
could
pretty
near
crall
through
the
cracks
in
it
and
all
the
boys
remarked
what
a
odd
little
speegle
it
was
and
they
never
saw
like
it
before
and
etc
and
finely
simon
could
keep
his
clam
shut
no
longer
so
he
asked
phillips
how
much
he
would
take
for
it
well
phillips
says
it
was
for
sale
as
speegles
was
scarce
in
germany
on
acct
of
the
war
and
that
was
why
the
dutchmens
always
looked
like
a
bum
when
you
took
them
a
prisoner
so
simon
asked
him
what
price
he
would
set
on
it
suppose
he
would
sell
it
and
phillips
says
about
franks
well
simon
got
out
all
his
jack
and
they
was
only
franks
and
he
showed
it
to
phillips
and
said
if
he
would
take
franks
for
the
speegle
he
would
give
him
franks
down
and
the
other
franks
when
he
got
hold
of
some
jack
so
phillips
hummed
and
hawed
a
wile
and
finely
said
all
right
simon
could
have
it
but
he
would
never
sell
it
to
him
only
that
it
kept
worring
him
so
much
to
carry
it
in
his
pocket
for
the
fear
he
would
loose
it
or
break
it
well
al
phillips
has
got
simon
last
franks
and
simon
has
got
speegle
and
i
suppose
now
that
the
boys
sees
how
soft
it
is
they
will
be
selling
him
stuff
on
credit
and
he
will
owe
them
his
next
months
pay
before
they
get
through
with
him
and
i
suppose
the
next
thing
you
know
they
will
keep
their
beard
when
they
shave
and
sell
it
to
him
for
german
tobacco
well
i
would
half
to
be
pretty
hard
up
before
i
went
in
on
some
skin
game
like
that
and
i
would
just
as
leave
go
up
to
of
them
cripples
that
use
to
spraddle
all
over
the
walk
along
after
the
ball
game
and
stick
my
heel
in
their
eye
and
romp
off
with
their
days
receipts
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
june
friend
al
well
al
it
seems
like
capt
seeley
is
up
on
his
ear
because
they
have
took
our
regt
out
of
here
yet
because
it
seems
pershing
told
foch
that
he
was
to
help
himself
to
any
part
of
the
army
and
throw
them
in
where
ever
they
was
needed
and
they
been
a
bunch
of
the
boys
throwed
in
along
the
other
parts
of
the
front
to
try
and
stop
the
germans
and
capt
seeley
is
raveing
because
they
keep
us
here
and
take
us
where
we
can
get
some
actions
any
way
of
the
lieuts
told
some
of
the
boys
that
if
we
did
get
took
out
of
here
pretty
quick
capt
seeley
would
start
a
war
of
our
own
on
this
section
and
all
the
officers
was
sore
because
we
had
done
nothing
or
took
no
prisoners
or
nothing
you
might
say
only
make
repairs
in
the
wire
and
etc
well
al
how
in
the
he
ll
can
we
show
them
anything
when
they
do
never
send
us
over
the
top
or
nowheres
else
but
just
leave
us
here
moldering
you
might
say
but
at
that
i
guess
we
have
showed
as
much
life
as
the
birds
that
over
there
opp
us
in
them
other
trenchs
that
has
hardly
peeped
since
we
come
in
here
and
the
boys
says
they
are
a
saxon
regt
that
comes
from
part
of
germany
where
the
kaiser
is
thought
of
the
same
as
a
gum
boil
so
the
saxons
feels
kind
of
friendly
towards
us
and
they
will
leave
us
alone
as
long
as
we
leave
them
alone
and
visa
and
versa
so
i
do
see
where
capt
seeley
and
them
other
officers
has
got
a
right
to
pan
us
for
not
showing
nothing
but
i
blame
them
for
wishing
they
would
take
us
out
of
here
and
show
us
the
war
and
from
all
as
we
hear
they
plenty
of
places
where
we
could
do
some
good
or
at
lease
as
much
good
as
the
birds
that
has
been
there
well
al
they
have
been
stringing
poor
simon
along
and
today
they
give
him
a
song
and
dance
about
some
bird
name
joe
in
the
regt
that
was
here
ahead
of
us
that
got
a
collection
of
souvenirs
that
makes
simon
look
rotten
and
they
said
the
guy
pals
called
him
souvenir
joe
on
acct
of
him
haveing
such
a
fine
collection
so
brady
says
to
simon
all
you
have
got
is
or
articles
and
the
next
thing
you
know
they
will
be
takeing
us
out
of
here
and
you
might
maybe
never
get
another
chance
to
pick
up
any
more
rare
articles
so
if
i
was
you
i
would
either
get
busy
and
get
a
real
collection
or
throw
away
them
things
you
have
got
and
forget
it
so
simon
says
how
can
i
get
any
more
souvenirs
when
i
have
no
more
jack
to
buy
them
and
besides
you
birds
have
no
more
to
sell
so
brady
says
souvenir
joe
did
buy
his
collection
but
he
went
out
and
got
them
so
simon
asked
him
where
at
and
brady
told
him
this
here
joe
use
to
crall
out
in
nobody
land
every
night
and
pick
up
something
and
simon
says
it
was
a
wonder
he
did
get
killed
so
brady
says
how
would
he
get
killed
as
the
trenchs
over
across
the
way
was
just
as
empty
when
he
was
here
as
they
are
now
and
old
legged
mike
and
his
motorcycle
was
on
the
job
then
to
so
joe
would
wait
till
mike
had
throwed
a
few
flares
on
this
section
and
then
he
would
sneak
out
and
get
his
souvenirs
before
mike
come
back
again
on
his
rounds
well
then
simon
asked
him
where
the
souvenirs
was
out
there
and
brady
says
they
was
in
the
different
shell
holes
because
most
of
joe
souvenirs
was
the
insides
of
german
shells
that
had
exploded
and
they
was
the
best
kind
of
souvenirs
as
they
was
no
chance
of
them
being
a
fake
well
al
i
had
a
notion
to
take
simon
to
side
and
tell
him
to
not
pay
no
tension
to
these
smart
alex
because
the
poor
crum
might
go
snooping
out
there
some
night
after
the
insides
of
a
shell
and
get
the
outsides
and
all
and
if
something
like
that
happened
to
him
i
would
feel
like
a
murder
though
i
have
never
took
no
part
in
makeing
a
monkey
out
of
him
but
i
thought
well
if
the
poor
cheese
do
know
no
more
then
that
he
is
better
off
dead
let
him
go
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
june
friend
al
just
a
line
al
as
i
am
to
excited
to
write
much
but
i
knew
you
would
want
to
know
the
big
news
well
al
i
have
got
a
daughter
born
the
of
may
how
is
that
for
a
supprise
al
but
i
guess
you
wo
be
no
more
supprised
than
i
was
when
the
news
come
as
florrie
had
gave
me
no
hint
and
a
man
ca
guess
a
thing
like
that
when
you
are
in
france
and
the
lady
in
question
is
back
in
old
chi
but
it
sure
is
wonderfull
news
al
and
i
only
wished
i
was
somewheres
where
i
could
celebrate
it
right
but
you
even
whistle
here
or
somebody
would
crown
you
with
a
shovle
well
al
the
news
come
today
in
a
letter
from
florrie
sister
marie
allen
and
she
has
been
down
in
texas
but
i
suppose
florrie
got
her
to
come
up
and
stay
with
her
though
as
far
as
i
can
sec
its
bad
enough
to
have
a
baby
without
haveing
that
bird
in
the
house
to
but
they
i
consolation
we
have
got
rm
in
the
apt
for
more
than
kids
and
grown
ups
so
when
i
get
home
if
sweet
marie
is
still
there
yet
we
will
either
half
to
get
rid
of
the
swede
cook
or
she
and
when
it
comes
to
a
choice
between
a
ski
jumper
that
will
work
and
a
sister
that
wo
why
florrie
wo
be
bothered
with
no
family
ties
any
way
i
have
no
time
to
worry
about
no
allen
family
now
as
i
am
feeling
to
good
and
all
as
i
wish
is
that
somebody
wins
this
war
dam
toot
sweet
so
as
i
can
get
home
and
see
this
little
chick
al
and
i
bet
she
is
as
pretty
as
a
picture
and
she
could
be
nothing
else
you
might
say
and
i
have
wrote
to
florrie
to
not
name
her
or
nothing
till
i
have
my
say
as
you
turn
a
woman
loose
on
nameing
somebody
all
alone
and
they
go
nuts
and
look
through
a
seed
catalog
well
old
pal
i
know
you
would
congratulate
me
if
you
was
here
and
i
am
only
sorry
i
ca
return
the
complement
and
if
i
was
you
and
bertha
i
would
adopt
of
these
here
belgium
orphans
that
lost
their
parents
as
nothing
like
it
al
haveing
a
kid
or
in
the
house
and
i
bet
little
al
is
tickled
to
death
with
his
little
sister
well
al
i
have
told
all
the
boys
about
it
and
they
have
been
haveing
a
lot
of
fun
with
me
but
any
way
they
call
me
papa
now
which
is
a
he
ll
of
a
lot
better
then
sammy
boy
your
pal
jack
the
trenchs
june
friend
al
i
am
all
most
to
nervous
to
write
al
but
anything
is
better
then
setting
around
thinking
and
besides
i
want
you
to
know
what
has
came
off
so
as
you
will
know
what
come
off
in
the
case
something
happens
well
al
simple
simon
gone
we
do
know
if
he
dead
or
alive
or
what
the
he
ll
and
all
as
we
know
is
that
he
was
here
last
night
and
he
here
today
and
they
has
nobody
seen
or
heard
of
him
of
course
al
that
is
all
we
know
neither
as
we
can
just
about
guess
what
happened
but
i
have
gave
my
word
to
not
spill
nothing
about
what
the
boys
pulled
on
him
or
god
knows
what
capt
seeley
would
do
to
them
well
al
i
got
up
this
feeling
fine
as
i
had
slept
better
then
any
time
for
a
wk
and
i
dreamt
about
the
little
gal
back
home
that
ai
never
seen
her
daddy
or
do
know
if
she
got
or
not
but
in
my
dream
she
knowed
me
as
i
dreamt
i
had
just
got
home
and
florrie
was
there
to
meet
me
as
usual
but
i
rung
the
bell
and
the
ski
jumper
let
me
in
and
i
asked
her
where
florrie
was
and
she
said
she
had
went
out
somewheres
with
little
al
so
i
was
going
out
and
look
for
them
but
the
swede
says
the
baby
is
here
if
you
want
to
see
her
and
i
asked
her
what
baby
and
she
says
why
your
new
little
baby
girl
so
then
i
heard
a
baby
crying
somewheres
in
the
house
and
i
went
in
the
bed
rm
and
this
little
mite
jumped
right
up
out
of
bed
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
yrs
old
instead
of
a
mo
and
she
come
running
to
me
and
hollered
daddy
so
then
i
grabbed
her
up
and
we
begin
danceing
around
but
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
i
and
florrie
that
was
danceing
together
and
little
al
and
the
little
gal
was
danceing
around
us
and
then
i
woke
up
al
and
found
i
was
still
in
this
he
ll
hole
but
the
dream
was
so
happy
that
i
was
still
feeling
good
over
it
yet
and
besides
it
looked
like
the
sun
had
forgot
it
was
in
france
and
was
going
to
shine
for
a
while
well
pretty
soon
along
come
evans
and
called
me
to
side
and
asked
me
what
i
knew
about
simon
so
i
says
what
about
him
so
evans
says
he
is
missing
and
they
has
nobody
saw
him
since
last
night
so
i
says
i
did
know
nothing
about
him
but
if
anything
had
happened
to
him
they
was
a
lot
of
birds
in
this
that
ought
to
pay
for
it
so
evans
asked
me
what
was
i
driveing
at
and
i
started
in
to
tell
him
about
alcock
and
brady
and
them
kidding
this
poor
bird
to
death
and
evans
says
yes
he
knew
all
about
that
and
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
shut
up
about
it
as
it
would
get
everybody
in
bad
he
says
wait
a
couple
days
any
way
and
maybe
he
will
show
up
and
then
they
wo
be
no
sence
in
spilling
all
this
stuff
so
i
says
all
right
i
would
wait
a
couple
days
but
these
birds
ought
to
get
theirs
if
something
serious
has
happened
and
if
he
do
show
up
by
that
time
i
wo
make
no
promise
to
spill
all
i
know
so
evans
says
i
did
half
to
make
no
promise
as
he
would
spill
the
beans
himself
if
simon
is
well
al
of
course
all
the
boys
had
heard
the
news
by
the
time
i
got
to
talk
to
them
and
they
or
of
them
that
feels
pretty
sick
over
it
and
no
wonder
and
the
bird
that
feels
the
sickest
is
alcock
and
here
is
why
well
it
seems
like
yesterday
while
i
was
telling
all
the
boys
about
the
news
from
home
simon
was
giveing
alcock
a
ear
full
of
that
junk
brady
had
been
slipping
him
about
souvenir
joe
and
simon
asked
alcock
if
he
thought
they
was
still
any
of
them
souvenirs
worth
going
after
out
in
them
shell
holes
so
alcock
says
of
course
they
must
be
as
some
of
the
holes
was
made
new
since
we
been
here
but
alcock
told
him
that
if
he
was
him
he
waist
no
time
collecting
the
insides
of
german
shells
as
the
germans
was
so
hard
up
for
mettle
and
etc
now
days
that
the
shells
they
was
sending
over
was
about
full
of
cheese
and
stuff
that
would
keep
so
alcock
says
to
him
what
you
ought
to
go
after
is
a
saxon
because
you
can
bet
that
souvenir
joe
did
get
none
and
if
you
would
get
all
the
boys
would
begin
calling
you
souvenir
simon
instead
of
simple
simon
and
you
would
make
souvenir
joe
look
like
a
dud
well
al
simon
did
know
a
saxon
from
a
hang
nail
so
he
asked
alcock
what
they
looked
like
and
alcock
told
him
to
never
mind
as
he
could
help
from
knowing
if
he
ever
seen
it
so
then
simon
asked
him
where
they
was
libel
to
be
and
alcock
told
him
probably
over
in
some
of
the
shell
holes
near
the
german
trench
that
what
come
off
yesterday
wile
i
was
busy
telling
everybody
about
the
little
gal
as
you
can
bet
i
would
of
put
simon
wise
had
i
of
been
in
on
it
and
now
al
he
gone
and
they
do
nobody
know
what
became
of
him
but
they
a
lot
of
us
that
got
a
pretty
good
idear
and
as
i
say
they
or
feels
pretty
sick
and
one
a
specially
but
i
guess
at
that
they
do
no
one
feel
no
worse
then
me
though
they
ca
nobody
say
i
am
to
blame
for
what
happened
but
still
in
all
i
might
of
interfered
because
i
am
the
only
of
them
that
has
got
a
heart
al
and
the
only
reason
alcock
and
brady
is
so
sick
now
is
that
they
are
scared
to
death
of
what
will
happen
to
them
if
they
get
found
out
because
their
smartness
wo
get
them
nothing
up
in
front
of
the
court
marshall
as
he
has
seen
to
many
birds
just
like
them
well
al
i
am
on
post
duty
tonight
and
maybe
you
do
know
what
that
means
well
old
pal
its
no
elks
carnivle
at
no
time
and
just
think
what
it
will
be
tonight
with
your
ears
straining
for
a
cry
from
out
there
and
if
the
cry
comes
al
they
wo
only
be
the
thing
to
do
and
i
will
be
the
to
do
it
so
this
may
be
the
last
time
you
will
hear
from
me
old
pal
and
i
wanted
you
to
know
in
the
case
anything
come
off
just
how
it
happened
as
i
wo
be
here
to
write
it
to
you
afterwards
all
as
i
can
think
about
now
al
is
things
and
of
them
is
that
little
gal
back
home
that
wo
never
see
her
daddy
but
maybe
when
she
gets
or
yrs
old
she
will
ask
her
mother
why
have
i
got
a
daddy
like
other
little
girls
but
maybe
she
will
have
by
that
time
al
but
what
i
am
thinking
about
the
most
is
that
poor
wit
out
there
and
as
brady
says
he
is
nothing
but
a
mormon
any
way
and
ought
never
to
of
got
in
the
army
but
still
and
all
he
is
a
man
and
its
our
duty
to
fight
and
die
for
him
if
needs
to
be
your
pal
jack
the
hospital
july
friend
al
you
will
half
to
excuse
this
writeing
as
i
am
proped
up
in
a
funny
position
in
bed
and
its
all
as
i
can
do
to
keep
the
paper
steady
as
my
left
arm
ai
no
more
use
then
the
russian
front
well
al
yesterday
was
the
time
they
left
me
set
up
and
i
wrote
a
letter
to
florrie
and
told
her
i
was
getting
along
as
i
did
want
she
should
worry
and
this
time
i
will
try
and
write
to
you
i
suppose
you
got
the
note
that
the
little
nurse
wrote
for
me
about
wks
ago
and
told
you
i
was
getting
better
well
old
pal
the
gal
that
wrote
you
that
little
note
is
some
baby
and
if
you
could
see
the
kid
that
wrote
you
that
little
note
you
would
wished
you
was
laying
here
in
my
place
no
i
guess
you
would
wished
that
al
as
they
nobody
that
would
want
to
go
through
what
i
have
been
through
and
they
very
few
that
could
stand
it
like
i
have
and
keep
on
smileing
well
old
pal
they
thought
for
a
wile
that
it
was
feeney
for
yrs
truly
as
they
say
over
here
and
believe
me
i
was
in
such
pain
that
i
would
of
been
glad
to
die
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
and
the
said
it
was
a
good
thing
i
was
such
a
game
bird
and
had
such
a
physic
or
i
could
of
never
stood
it
but
i
am
not
strong
enough
yet
to
set
this
way
very
long
so
if
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
happened
i
had
better
start
in
well
al
this
is
the
of
july
and
that
means
i
have
been
in
here
wks
as
it
was
the
of
june
when
all
this
come
off
well
al
i
can
remember
writeing
to
you
the
day
of
the
night
it
come
off
and
i
guess
i
told
you
about
this
bird
simon
getting
lost
that
was
always
after
the
souvenirs
and
some
of
the
boys
told
him
they
was
no
germans
over
in
the
other
trenchs
but
just
a
bird
name
motorcycle
mike
that
went
up
and
down
the
section
throwing
flares
so
as
we
would
think
they
was
germans
over
there
so
they
told
him
if
he
wanted
to
go
out
in
nobody
land
and
spear
souvenirs
it
was
safe
if
you
went
just
after
mike
had
made
his
rounds
so
as
the
snippers
would
get
you
well
old
pal
i
was
standing
there
looking
out
over
nobody
land
that
night
and
i
could
think
of
nothing
only
poor
simon
and
listening
to
hear
if
i
could
maybe
hear
him
call
from
somewheres
out
there
and
i
do
know
how
long
i
had
been
standing
there
when
i
heard
a
kind
of
a
noise
like
somebody
scrunching
and
at
the
same
time
they
was
a
flare
throwed
up
from
our
side
and
i
seen
a
figure
out
there
cralling
on
the
ground
quite
a
ways
beyond
our
wire
well
al
i
did
wait
to
look
twice
but
i
called
evans
and
told
him
so
he
says
who
did
i
think
it
was
and
i
said
it
must
be
simon
so
he
says
well
keefe
its
up
to
of
us
to
go
get
him
so
i
said
well
corp
i
guess
its
my
job
so
he
says
all
right
keefe
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
so
i
says
all
right
and
i
say
al
that
he
give
up
his
claims
without
a
struggle
well
i
started
and
i
was
going
without
my
riffle
but
the
stopped
me
and
says
take
it
along
and
i
says
what
for
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
pick
simon
up
with
a
bayonet
so
he
says
who
told
me
it
was
simon
out
there
well
al
that
the
time
i
stopped
to
think
it
might
maybe
be
somebody
else
well
florrie
use
to
say
that
i
could
get
up
in
the
night
for
a
drink
of
water
without
everybody
in
the
bldg
thinking
the
world
serious
must
of
started
but
i
bet
i
did
knock
over
no
chairs
on
this
trip
well
al
it
took
me
long
enough
to
get
out
there
as
you
can
bet
i
was
trying
for
no
record
and
every
time
they
was
a
noise
i
had
to
lay
flat
and
not
buge
but
i
got
there
al
to
where
i
thought
i
had
saw
this
bird
moveing
around
but
they
had
no
rockets
went
up
since
i
started
and
it
was
like
a
troop
ship
and
i
could
make
out
no
figure
of
a
man
or
nothing
else
and
i
was
just
going
to
whisper
simon
name
when
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
touched
him
well
al
it
was
simon
well
old
pal
we
had
some
battle
this
bird
and
me
and
the
both
of
us
forgot
bayonets
and
guns
and
everything
else
i
would
of
killed
him
sure
only
he
got
a
hold
of
my
left
hand
between
his
teeth
and
i
could
pry
it
loose
but
believe
me
al
he
took
a
awful
beating
with
my
free
hand
and
i
will
half
to
hand
it
to
him
for
a
game
bird
only
what
chance
did
he
have
none
al
and
the
battle
could
only
end
the
way
and
i
was
just
getting
ready
to
grab
his
wind
pipe
and
shut
off
the
meter
when
he
left
go
of
my
other
hand
and
let
out
a
yell
that
you
could
hear
all
over
the
great
lakes
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
seemed
like
everybody
was
takeing
a
flash
light
and
then
the
bullets
come
whizzing
from
all
sides
it
seemed
like
and
they
got
me
times
al
and
never
pinked
this
other
bird
once
well
al
it
was
till
wks
ago
that
i
found
out
that
my
opponent
was
johnny
alcock
just
wks
ago
yesterday
johnny
come
in
and
seen
me
and
told
me
the
whole
story
and
it
was
the
day
they
left
me
see
anybody
only
the
and
the
little
nurse
and
was
the
day
johnny
was
able
to
be
up
and
around
how
is
that
al
to
put
a
man
in
the
hospital
for
wks
without
useing
no
gun
or
knife
or
nothing
on
him
only
bear
fist
some
fist
eh
al
well
it
seems
like
he
had
been
worring
so
about
simon
that
he
finely
went
out
there
snooping
around
all
by
himself
looking
for
him
and
he
was
the
i
seen
when
that
flare
went
up
and
of
course
we
each
thought
the
other
was
a
german
and
finely
it
was
him
yelling
and
the
rockets
going
up
at
the
same
time
that
drawed
the
fire
and
i
got
all
of
it
because
i
was
the
bird
on
top
but
listen
al
till
you
hear
the
funny
part
of
it
simple
simon
the
bird
that
we
was
both
out
there
looking
for
him
showed
up
in
our
trench
about
a
hr
after
we
was
brought
in
and
he
showed
up
with
a
saxon
all
right
but
the
saxon
was
dead
well
al
simon
told
them
that
he
had
ran
into
this
guy
over
near
their
wire
and
that
he
was
alive
when
he
got
him
but
alcock
says
that
brady
said
simon
had
only
been
gone
hrs
and
the
saxon
had
been
gone
a
he
ll
of
a
lot
longer
than
that
well
they
no
hard
feeling
between
alcock
and
i
and
i
guess
i
more
then
got
even
with
him
for
eating
out
of
my
hand
as
they
say
but
johnny
said
it
was
a
shame
i
could
of
used
some
of
my
strength
on
a
german
instead
of
him
but
any
way
its
all
over
now
and
the
says
my
leg
is
pretty
near
and
i
can
walk
on
it
in
a
couple
wks
but
my
left
arm
wo
be
no
use
for
god
knows
how
long
and
maybe
never
and
i
guess
i
lucky
they
half
to
clip
it
off
so
i
do
know
when
i
will
get
out
of
here
or
where
i
will
go
from
here
but
i
guess
they
little
party
that
ai
in
no
hurry
to
see
me
go
and
i
wished
you
could
see
her
look
at
me
al
and
you
would
say
its
to
bad
i
am
a
married
man
with
kids
your
pal
jack
illustration
and
i
wished
you
could
see
her
look
at
me
al
in
france
friend
al
well
al
i
do
suppose
this
will
reach
you
any
sooner
then
if
i
took
it
with
me
and
mailed
it
when
i
get
home
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
for
a
few
hrs
so
i
might
as
well
be
writeing
you
the
news
well
old
pal
i
am
homewards
bound
as
they
say
as
the
war
is
feeney
as
far
as
i
am
conserned
and
i
am
sailing
tonight
along
with
a
lot
of
the
other
boys
that
being
sent
home
for
good
and
when
i
look
at
some
of
the
rest
of
them
i
guess
i
am
lucky
to
be
in
as
good
a
shape
as
i
am
i
am
only
for
my
arm
and
wile
it
wo
never
be
as
good
as
it
was
i
can
probably
get
to
use
it
pretty
good
in
a
few
months
and
all
as
i
can
say
is
thank
god
it
is
my
left
arm
and
not
the
old
souper
that
use
to
stand
cobb
and
them
on
their
head
and
it
will
stand
them
on
their
head
again
al
as
soon
as
this
war
is
over
and
i
guess
i
wo
half
to
go
begging
to
comiskey
to
give
me
another
chance
after
what
i
have
done
as
even
if
i
could
pitch
up
a
alley
i
would
be
a
money
maker
for
them
just
setting
on
the
bench
and
showing
myself
after
this
well
we
are
saying
good
by
to
old
france
and
i
do
know
how
the
rest
of
the
boys
feels
but
i
am
not
haveing
no
trouble
controling
myself
and
when
it
comes
down
to
cases
al
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
and
what
i
am
getting
at
is
that
france
ought
to
be
the
that
hates
to
see
us
leave
as
i
doubt
if
they
will
ever
get
a
bunch
of
spenders
like
us
over
here
again
well
al
it
certainly
seems
quite
down
here
in
this
old
sea
port
town
after
what
we
have
been
through
and
it
seems
like
i
can
still
hear
them
big
guns
roar
and
them
riffles
crack
and
etc
and
i
feel
like
i
ought
to
keep
my
head
down
all
the
wile
and
keep
out
of
the
snippers
way
and
i
could
all
most
shut
my
eyes
and
imagine
i
was
back
there
again
in
that
he
ll
hole
but
i
know
i
not
al
as
i
do
itch
well
al
my
wounds
is
the
only
reason
i
am
comeing
home
but
another
reason
and
that
is
that
they
want
some
of
us
poplar
idles
to
help
rouse
up
the
public
on
this
here
next
liberty
loan
and
i
do
mind
it
as
they
have
promised
to
send
me
home
to
chi
and
i
can
be
with
florrie
and
the
kids
i
will
do
what
i
can
al
though
i
ca
figure
where
the
public
would
need
any
rouseing
up
and
they
certainly
would
if
they
had
of
been
through
what
i
have
been
through
and
maybe
some
of
the
other
boys
to
it
takes
jack
to
run
a
war
al
even
if
us
boys
do
get
none
of
it
or
what
we
do
get
they
either
send
it
home
to
our
wife
or
take
it
away
from
us
in
a
crap
game
well
old
pal
i
left
the
hospital
the
day
before
yesterday
and
that
was
the
only
time
i
felt
like
crying
since
they
told
me
i
was
going
home
and
it
was
so
much
for
myself
al
but
that
poor
little
nurse
and
you
would
of
felt
like
crying
to
if
you
could
of
seen
the
look
she
give
me
her
name
is
charlotte
warren
and
she
lives
in
minneapolis
and
expects
to
go
right
back
there
after
she
is
through
over
here
but
that
do
do
me
no
good
as
a
married
man
with
a
couple
children
has
got
something
better
to
do
besides
flirting
with
a
pretty
little
nurse
and
besides
i
wo
never
pitch
ball
in
minneapolis
as
i
expect
to
quit
the
game
when
i
am
about
well
al
some
of
the
boys
wants
to
say
their
farewells
to
the
vin
rouge
and
the
la
la
las
and
i
will
half
to
close
and
i
will
write
again
as
soon
as
i
get
home
and
tell
you
what
the
baby
gal
looks
like
though
they
only
the
way
she
could
look
and
that
good
well
here
is
good
by
to
france
and
good
luck
to
all
the
boys
that
going
to
stay
over
here
and
simple
simon
with
the
rest
of
them
and
i
suppose
i
ought
to
of
got
a
few
souvenirs
off
him
to
bring
home
with
me
but
i
guess
at
that
i
will
be
carrying
a
souvenir
of
this
war
for
a
long
wile
al
and
its
better
than
any
of
them
foney
ones
he
has
got
as
the
i
have
got
shows
i
was
realy
in
it
and
done
my
bit
for
old
glory
and
the
a
your
pal
jack
friend
al
well
al
here
i
am
back
in
old
chi
and
feeling
pretty
good
only
for
my
arm
and
my
left
leg
is
still
stiff
yet
and
i
caught
a
mean
cold
comeing
across
the
old
pond
but
what
is
a
few
little
things
like
that
as
the
main
thing
is
being
home
well
old
pal
they
was
nothing
happened
on
the
trip
across
the
old
pond
only
it
took
a
whole
lot
to
long
and
believe
me
old
looked
good
but
believe
me
i
would
waist
no
time
in
only
long
enough
to
climb
outside
a
big
steak
and
the
waiter
had
to
cut
it
up
for
me
but
even
the
waiters
treated
us
fine
and
everywheres
we
showed
up
the
people
was
wild
about
us
and
cheered
and
clapped
and
it
sounded
like
old
times
when
i
use
to
walk
out
there
to
warm
up
well
we
hit
in
the
and
left
that
night
and
got
here
last
eve
and
i
did
leave
florrie
know
just
when
i
was
comeing
as
i
wanted
to
supprise
her
well
al
i
ought
to
of
wired
ahead
and
told
her
to
go
easy
on
my
poor
old
arm
because
when
she
opened
the
door
and
seen
me
she
give
a
running
hop
step
and
jump
and
dam
near
killed
me
so
then
she
seen
my
arm
in
a
sling
and
cried
and
cried
and
she
says
oh
my
poor
boy
what
have
you
been
through
so
i
says
well
you
have
been
through
something
yourself
so
its
only
i
got
this
from
a
german
well
al
little
al
was
the
cutest
thing
you
ever
seen
and
he
grabbed
me
by
the
good
hand
and
rushed
me
in
to
where
the
little
stranger
was
laying
and
she
was
asleep
but
we
broke
the
rules
for
once
and
all
and
all
it
was
some
party
and
she
is
some
little
gal
al
and
pretty
as
a
picture
and
when
you
can
say
that
for
a
mos
old
its
going
some
as
the
most
of
them
looks
like
a
french
breakfast
well
i
finely
happened
to
think
of
sister
marie
and
i
asked
where
she
was
at
and
florrie
says
she
went
back
to
texas
so
i
says
tough
luck
and
florrie
says
i
need
get
so
gay
the
evening
home
and
she
says
any
way
we
have
still
got
a
marie
in
the
house
as
that
is
what
i
call
the
baby
so
i
says
well
you
can
think
of
her
that
way
but
her
name
ai
going
to
be
that
as
i
do
like
the
name
so
she
says
what
name
did
i
like
and
i
pretended
like
i
was
thinking
a
wile
and
finely
i
says
what
is
the
matter
with
charlotte
well
al
you
will
half
to
hand
it
to
the
women
for
detectives
as
i
had
no
sooner
said
the
name
when
she
says
oh
no
you
ca
come
home
and
name
my
baby
after
none
of
your
french
nurses
and
i
had
told
her
nothing
about
a
nurse
well
any
way
i
says
i
had
met
a
whole
lot
more
maries
then
charlottes
in
france
and
she
says
had
i
met
any
florries
and
i
said
no
and
that
was
realy
the
name
i
had
picked
out
for
the
kid
so
she
says
well
she
did
like
the
name
herself
but
it
was
the
only
name
i
could
pick
out
that
she
would
be
suspicious
of
it
so
the
little
gal
is
named
after
her
mother
al
and
if
she
only
grows
up
as
pretty
as
her
old
lady
it
wo
make
no
differents
if
she
has
got
a
funny
name
well
al
have
you
noticed
what
direction
the
dutchmens
is
makeing
their
drive
in
now
they
started
going
the
other
way
the
of
july
and
it
was
days
ahead
of
that
time
that
our
regt
was
moved
over
to
the
war
and
now
they
are
running
them
ragged
well
al
i
wished
i
was
there
to
help
but
even
if
i
was
worth
a
dam
to
fight
i
could
very
well
leave
home
just
now
your
pal
jack
the
end
