the
art
of
the
moving
picture
by
vachel
lindsay
intended
first
of
all
for
the
new
art
museums
springing
up
all
over
the
country
but
the
book
is
for
our
universities
and
institutions
of
learning
it
contains
an
appeal
to
our
whole
critical
and
literary
world
and
to
our
creators
of
sculpture
architecture
painting
and
the
american
cities
they
are
building
being
the
revision
of
the
book
first
issued
in
and
beginning

an
ample
discourse
on
the
great
new
prospects
of

a
word
from
the
director
of
the
denver
art
association
the
art
of
the
moving
picture
as
it
appeared
six
years
ago
possessed
among
many
elements
of
beauty
at
least
one
peculiarity
it
viewed
art
as
a
reality
and
one
of
our
most
familiar
and
popular
realities
as
an
art
this
should
have
made
the
book
either
a
revelation
or
utter
greek
to
most
of
us
and
those
who
read
it
probably
dropped
it
easily
into
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
categories
for
myself
long
a
propagandist
for
its
doctrines
in
another
but
related
field
the
book
came
as
a
great
solace
in
it
i
found
not
an
appeal
to
have
the
art
museum
used
which
would
have
been
an
old
though
welcome
story
not
this
but
much
to
my
surprise
the
art
museum
actually
at
work
one
of
the
very
wheels
on
which
our
culture
rolled
forward
upon
its
hopeful
way
i
saw
among
other
museums
the
one
whose
destinies
i
was
tenderly
guiding
playing
in
lindsay
book
the
part
that
is
played
by
the
classic
myths
in
milton
or
by
the
dictionary
in
the
writings
of
the
rest
of
us
for
once
the
museum
and
its
contents
appeared
not
as
a
lovely
curiosity
but
as
one
of
the
basic
and
in
a
sense
humble
necessities
of
life
to
paraphrase
the
author
own
text
the
art
museum
like
the
furniture
in
a
good
movie
was
actually
in
motion
a
character
in
the
play
on
this
point
of
view
as
on
a
pivot
turns
the
whole
book
in
the
art
of
the
moving
picture
the
nature
and
domain
of
a
new
muse
is
defined
she
is
the
first
legitimate
addition
to
the
family
since
classic
times
and
as
it
required
trained
painters
of
pictures
like
fulton
and
morse
to
visualize
the
possibility
of
the
steamboat
and
the
telegraph
so
the
bold
seer
who
perceived
the
true
nature
of
this
new
star
in
our
nightly
heavens
it
should
here
be
recorded
acquired
much
of
the
vision
of
his
seeing
eye
through
an
early
training
in
art
vachel
lindsay
as
he
himself
proudly
asserts
was
a
student
at
the
institute
in
chicago
for
four
years
spent
one
more
at
the
league
and
at
chase
in
new
york
and
for
four
more
haunted
the
metropolitan
museum
lecturing
to
his
fellows
on
every
art
there
shown
from
the
egyptian
to
that
of
arthur
davies
only
such
a
background
as
this
could
have
evolved
the
conception
of
architecture
sculpture
and
painting
in
motion
and
given
authenticity
to
its
presentation
the
validity
of
lindsay
analysis
is
attested
by
freeburg
helpful
characterization
composition
in
fluid
forms
which
it
seems
to
have
suggested
to
lindsay
category
one
would
be
tempted
to
add
pattern
in
motion
applying
it
to
such
a
film
as
the
caligari
which
he
and
i
have
seen
together
and
discussed
during
these
past
few
days
pattern
in
this
connection
would
imply
an
emphasis
on
the
intrinsic
suggestion
of
the
spot
and
shape
apart
from
their
immediate
relation
to
the
appearance
of
natural
objects
but
this
is
a
digression
it
simply
serves
to
show
the
breadth
and
adaptability
of
lindsay
method
the
book
was
written
for
a
public
and
for
those
who
would
be
its
leaders
a
long
long
line
of
trailing
from
the
dawn
of
history
stimulated
all
the
masterpieces
of
pictorial
art
from
altamira
to
michelangelo
for
less
than
five
centuries
now
gutenberg
has
had
them
scurrying
to
learn
their
a
b
c
but
they
are
drifting
back
to
their
old
ways
again
and
nightly
are
forming
themselves
in
cues
at
the
doorways
of
the
isis
the
tivoli
and
the
riviera
the
while
it
is
sadly
noted
that
pictures
are
driving
literature
off
the
parlor
table
with
the
creative
implications
of
this
new
pictorial
art
with
the
whole
race
clamoring
for
more
what
may
we
not
dream
in
the
way
of
a
new
renaissance
how
are
we
to
step
in
to
the
possession
of
such
a
destiny
are
the
institutions
with
a
purely
literary
theory
of
life
going
to
meet
the
need
are
the
art
schools
and
the
art
museums
making
themselves
ready
to
assimilate
a
new
art
form
or
what
is
the
type
of
institution
that
will
ultimately
take
the
position
of
leadership
in
culture
through
this
new
universal
instrument
what
possibilities
lie
in
this
art
once
it
is
understood
and
developed
to
plant
new
conceptions
of
civic
and
national
idealism
how
far
may
it
go
in
cultivating
concerted
emotion
in
the
now
ungoverned
crowd
such
questions
as
these
can
be
answered
only
by
minds
with
the
imagination
to
see
art
as
a
reality
with
faith
to
visualize
for
the
little
home
town
a
new
and
living
pallas
athena
with
courage
to
raze
the
very
houses
of
the
city
to
make
new
and
greater
forums
and
civic
centres
for
ourselves
in
denver
we
shall
try
to
do
justice
to
the
new
muse
in
the
museum
which
we
build
we
shall
provide
a
shrine
for
her
we
shall
first
endeavor
by
those
simple
means
which
lie
to
our
hands
to
know
the
areas
of
charm
and
imagination
which
remain
as
yet
an
untilled
field
of
her
domain
plowing
is
a
simple
art
but
it
requires
much
sweat
this
at
least
we
know
to
the
expenditure
we
cheerfully
consent
so
much
for
the
beginning
it
would
be
boastful
to
describe
plans
to
keep
pace
with
the
enlarging
of
the
motion
picture
field
before
a
real
beginning
is
made
but
with
youth
in
its
favor
the
denver
art
museum
hopes
yet
to
see
this
art
set
in
its
rightful
place
with
painting
sculpture
architecture
and
the
handicrafts
hopes
yet
to
be
an
instrument
in
the
great
work
of
making
this
art
real
as
those
others
are
being
even
now
made
real
to
the
expanding
vision
of
an
eager
people
george

association

colorado
new
year

book
i
the

photoplay
situation
in
america
january
especially
as
viewed
from
the
heights
of
the
civic
centre
at
denver
colorado
and
the
denver

museum
which
is
to
be
a
leading
feature
of
this
civic
centre
in
the
second
chapter
of
book
two
on
page
the
theoretical
outline
begins
with
a
discussion
of
the
photoplay
of
action
i
put
there
on
record
the
first
crude
commercial
films
that
in
any
way
establish
the
principle
there
can
never
be
but
one
first
of
anything
and
if
the
negatives
of
these
films
survive
the
shrinking
and
the
warping
that
comes
with
time
they
will
still
be
in
a
certain
sense
classic
and
ten
years
hence
or
two
years
hence
will
still
be
better
remembered
than
any
films
of
the
current
releases
which
come
on
like
newspapers
and
as
george
ade
says
nothing
is
so
dead
as
yesterday
newspaper
but
the
first
newspapers
and
the
first
imprints
of
addison
spectator
and
the
first
almanacs
of
benjamin
franklin
and
the
first
broadside
ballads
and
the
like
are
ever
collected
and
remembered
and
the
lists
of
films
given
in
books
two
and
three
of
this
work
are
the
only
critical
and
carefully
sorted
lists
of
the
early
motion
pictures
that
i
happen
to
know
anything
about
i
hope
to
be
corrected
if
i
am
too
boastful
but
i
boast
that
my
lists
must
be
referred
to
by
all
those
who
desire
to
study
these
experiments
in
their
beginnings
so
i
let
them
remain
as
still
vivid
in
the
memory
of
all
true
lovers
of
the
photoplay
who
have
watched
its
growth
fascinated
from
the
first
but
i
would
add
to
the
list
of
action
films
of
chapter
two
the
recent
popular
example
douglas
fairbanks
in
the
three
musketeers
that
is
perhaps
the
most
literal
that
was
ever
really
successful
in
the
commercial
world
the
story
is
cut
to
one
episode
the
whole
task
of
the
four
famous
swordsmen
of
dumas
is
to
get
the
queen
token
that
is
in
the
hands
of
buckingham
in
england
and
return
with
it
to
paris
in
time
for
the
great
ball
it
is
one
long
race
with
the
cardinal
guards
who
are
at
last
left
behind
it
is
the
same
plot
as
reynard
the
fox
john
masefield
poem
reynard
successfully
eluding
the
huntsmen
and
the
dogs
if
that
poem
is
ever
put
on
in
an
art
museum
film
it
will
have
to
be
staged
like
one
of
æsop
fables
with
a
acting
the
fox
for
the
children
delight
and
i
earnestly
urge
all
who
would
understand
the
deeper
significance
of
the
or
the
action
picture
to
give
more
thought
to
masefield
poem
than
to
fairbanks
marvellous
acting
in
the
school
of
the
younger
salvini
the
mood
of
the
chapter
three
still
remains
indicated
in
the
current
films
by
the
acting
of
lillian
gish
and
mary
pickford
when
they
are
not
roused
up
by
their
directors
to
turn
handsprings
to
keep
the
people
staring
mary
pickford
in
particular
has
been
stimulated
to
be
and
in
all
her
career
she
has
been
given
just
one
chance
to
be
her
more
delicate
self
and
that
was
in
the
almost
forgotten
film
a
romance
of
the
redwoods
this
is
one
of
the
serious
commercial
attempts
that
should
be
revived
and
studied
in
spite
of
its
crudities
of
plot
by
our
art
museums
there
is
something
of
the
grandeur
of
the
redwoods
in
it
in
contrast
to
the
sustained
botticelli
grace
of
our
mary
i
am
the
one
poet
who
has
a
right
to
claim
for
his
muses
blanche
sweet
mary
pickford
and
mae
marsh
i
am
the
one
poet
who
wrote
them
songs
when
they
were
biograph
heroines
before
their
names
were
put
on
the
screen
or
the
name
of
their
director
woman
clubs
are
always
asking
me
for
bits
of
delicious
gossip
about
myself
to
fill
up
literary
essays
now
there
a
bit
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
for
those
poems
first
they
were
heartfelt
second
any
one
could
improve
on
them
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
book
two
i
discourse
elaborately
and
formally
on
the
motion
picture
of
fairy
splendor
and
to
this
carefully
balanced
technical
discourse
i
would
add
the
informal
word
this
new
year
day
that
this
type
is
best
illustrated
by
such
as
have
been
most
ingratiatingly
retold
in
the
books
of
padraic
colum
and
dazzlingly
illustrated
by
willy
pogany
the
school
of
thought
is
one
which
the
commercial
producers
have
not
yet
condescended
to
illustrate
in
celluloid
and
it
remains
a
special
province
for
the
art
museum
film
need
not
be
more
than
of
a
reel
long
some
of
the
best
in
the
whole
history
of
man
can
be
told
in
a
breath
and
the
best
motion
picture
story
for
fifty
years
may
turn
out
to
be
a
reel
ten
minutes
long
do
not
let
the
length
of
the
commercial
film
tyrannize
over
your
mind
o
young
art
museum
photoplay
director
remember
the
brevity
of
lincoln
gettysburg
address
and
so
my
commentary
new
year
day
proceeds
using
for
points
of
more
and
more
extensive
departure
the
refrains
and
old
of
books
two
and
three
chapter
v
the
picture
of
crowd
splendor
being
the
type
illustrated
by
griffith
intolerance
chapter
vi
the
picture
of
patriotic
splendor
which
was
illustrated
by
all
the
war
films
the
one
most
recently
approved
and
accepted
by
the
public
being
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
chapter
vii
the
picture
of
religious
splendor
which
has
no
examples
that
remain
in
the
memory
with
any
sharpness
in
except
the
faith
healer
founded
on
the
play
by
william
vaughn
moody
the
poet
with
much
of
the
directing
and
scenario
by
william
vaughn
moody
and
a
more
commercial
film
the
miracle
man
but
not
until
the
religious
film
is
taken
out
of
the
commercial
field
and
allowed
to
develop
unhampered
under
the
church
and
the
art
museum
will
the
splendid
religious
and
ritualistic
opportunity
be
realized
chapter
viii
being
a
continuation
of
the
argument
of
chapter
two
the
photoplay
of
action
like
the
action
film
this
aspect
of
composition
is
much
better
understood
by
the
commercial
people
than
some
other
sides
of
the
art
some
of
the
best
of
the
william
hart
productions
show
appreciation
of
this
quality
by
the
director
the
photographer
and
the
public
not
only
is
the
man
but
the
horse
allowed
to
be
moving
bronze
and
not
mere
cowboy
pasteboard
many
of
the
pictures
of
charles
ray
make
the
hero
quite
a
sculpturesque
person
despite
his
yokel
raiment
chapter
ix
being
a
continuation
on
a
higher
terrace
of
chapter
three
the
intimate
photoplay
charlie
chaplin
has
intimate
and
painter
qualities
in
his
acting
and
he
makes
himself
into
a
painting
or
an
etching
in
the
midst
of
furious
slapstick
but
he
has
been
in
no
films
that
were
themselves
paintings
the
argument
of
this
chapter
has
been
carried
much
further
in
freeburg
book
the
art
of
photoplay
making
chapter
x
furniture
trappings
and
inventions
in
motion
being
a
continuation
of
the
chapter
on
fairy
splendor
in
this
field
we
find
one
of
the
worst
failures
of
the
commercial
films
and
their
utterly
unimaginative
corporation
promoters
again
i
must
refer
them
to
such
fairy
books
as
those
of
padraic
colum
where
neither
sword
nor
wing
nor
boat
is
found
to
move
except
for
a
fairy
reason
i
have
just
returned
this
very
afternoon
from
a
special
showing
of
the
famous
imported
film
the
cabinet
of
caligari
some
of
the
earnest
spirits
of
the
denver
art
association
finding
it
was
in
storage
in
the
town
had
it
privately
brought
forth
to
study
it
with
reference
to
its
bearing
on
their
new
policies
what
influence
it
will
have
in
that
most
vital
group
time
will
show
meanwhile
it
is
a
marvellous
illustration
of
the
meaning
of
this
chapter
and
the
chapter
on
fairy
splendor
though
it
is
a
diabolical
not
a
beneficent
vitality
that
is
given
to
inanimate
things
the
furniture
trappings
and
inventions
are
in
motion
to
express
the
haunted
mind
as
in
griffith
avenging

caligari
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
imported
film
since
that
work
of
cabiria
described
pages
through
but
it
is
the
opposite
type
of
film
cabiria
is
all
and
splendor
on
the
mediterranean
scale
in
general
imported
films
do
not
concern
americans
for
we
have
now
a
vast
range
of
technique
all
we
lack
is
the
sense
to
use
it
the
cabinet
of
caligari
is
indeed
a
cabinet
and
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
cell
and
smothered
by
all
the
oppressions
of
a
weary
mind
does
not
desert
the
spectator
for
a
minute
the
play
is
more
important
technically
than
in
its
and
mood
it
proves
in
a
hundred
new
ways
the
resources
of
the
film
in
making
all
the
inanimate
things
which
on
the
spoken
stage
can
not
act
at
all
the
leading
actors
in
the
films
but
they
need
not
necessarily
act
to
a
diabolical
end
an
angel
could
have
as
well
been
brought
from
the
cabinet
as
a
murderous
somnambulist
and
every
act
of
his
could
have
been
a
work
of
beneficence
and
health
and
healing
i
could
not
help
but
think
that
the
ancient
miracle
play
of
the
resurrection
of
osiris
could
have
been
acted
out
with
similar
simple
means
with
a
mummy
case
and
great
sarcophagus
the
wings
of
isis
and
nephthys
could
have
been
spread
over
the
sky
instead
of
the
oppressive
walls
of
the
crooked
city
lights
instead
of
shadows
could
have
been
made
actors
and
real
hieroglyphic
inscriptions
instead
of
scrawls
as
it
was
the
alleged
insane
man
was
more
sensible
than
most
motion
picture
directors
for
his
scenery
acted
with
him
and
not
according
to
accident
or
silly
formula
i
make
these
points
as
an
antidote
to
the
general
description
of
this
production
by
those
who
praise
it
they
speak
of
the
scenery
as
grotesque
strained
and
experimental
and
the
plot
as
sinister
but
this
does
not
get
to
the
root
of
the
matter
there
is
rather
the
implication
in
most
of
the
criticisms
and
praises
that
the
scenery
is
abstract
quite
the
contrary
is
the
case
indoors
looks
like
indoors
streets
are
always
streets
roofs
are
always
roofs
the
actors
do
not
move
about
in
a
kind
of
crazy
geometry
as
i
was
led
to
believe
the
scenery
is
oppressive
but
sane
and
the
obsession
is
for
the
most
part
expressed
in
the
acting
and
plot
the
fair
looks
like
a
fair
and
the
library
looks
like
a
library
there
is
nothing
experimental
about
any
of
the
setting
nothing
unconsidered
or
strained
or
it
seems
experimental
because
it
is
thrown
into
contrast
with
extreme
commercial
formulas
in
the
regular
line
of
the
movie
trade
but
compare
the
cabinet
of
caligari
with
a
book
of
rackham
or
du
lac
or
dürer
or
rembrandt
etchings
and
caligari
is
more
realistic
and
eggers
insists
the
whole
film
is
replete
with
suggestions
of
the
work
of
pieter
breughel
the
painter
hundreds
of
indoor
stories
will
be
along
such
lines
once
the
merely
commercial
motive
is
eliminated
and
the
artist
is
set
free
this
film
is
an
extraordinary
variation
of
the
intimate
as
expounded
in
chapter
three
it
is
instead
of
because
it
was
drawing
instead
of
painting
people
stepped
to
the
hasty
conclusion
it
was
experimental
effects
are
for
the
most
part
eliminated
line
is
dominant
everywhere
it
is
the
opposite
of
vast
conceptions
like
theodora
which
are
all
the
architecture
of
the
caligari
film
seems
pasteboard
the
whole
thing
happens
in
a
cabinet
it
is
the
most
overwhelming
contrast
to
griffith
intolerance
that
could
be
in
any
way
imagined
it
contains
one
may
say
all
the
effects
left
out
of
intolerance
the
word
cabinet
is
a
quadruple
pun
not
only
does
it
mean
a
mystery
box
and
a
box
holding
a
somnambulist
but
a
kind
of
treasury
of
tiny
twisted
thoughts
there
is
not
one
line
or
conception
in
it
on
the
grand
scale
or
even
the
grandiose
it
is
a
devil
one
feels
like
a
mouse
in
a
so
small
one
can
not
turn
around
in
intolerance
griffith
hurls
nation
at
nation
race
at
race
century
against
century
and
his
camera
is
not
only
a
telescope
across
the
plains
of
babylon
but
across
the
ages
griffith
is
in
intolerance
the
ungrammatical
byron
of
the
films
but
certainly
as
magnificent
as
byron
and
since
he
is
the
first
of
his
kind
i
for
one
am
willing
to
name
him
with
marlowe
but
for
technical
study
for
art
schools
the
cabinet
of
caligari
is
more
profitable
it
shows
how
masterpieces
can
be
made
with
the
furniture
of
any
attic
but
i
hope
not
diabolical
stories
will
come
from
these
attics
are
inherent
in
the
genius
of
the
motion
picture
and
are
a
thousand
times
hinted
at
in
the
commercial
films
though
the
commercial
films
are
not
willing
to
stop
to
tell
them
lillian
gish
could
be
given
wings
and
a
wand
if
she
only
had
directors
and
scenario
writers
who
believed
in
fairies
and
the
same
can
most
heartily
be
said
of
mae
marsh
chapter
xi
being
a
continuation
of
the
argument
about
the
splendor
pictures
in
chapters
five
six
and
seven
this
is
an
element
constantly
in
a
magnificent
but
fragmentary
way
by
the
news
films
any
picture
of
a
seagull
flying
so
close
to
the
camera
that
it
becomes
as
large
as
a
flying
machine
or
any
flying
machine
made
by
man
and
photographed
in
epic
flight
captures
the
eye
because
it
is
architecture
and
in
motion
motion
which
is
the
mysterious
fourth
dimension
of
its
grace
and
glory
so
likewise
and
in
kind
any
picture
of
a
tossing
ship
the
most
superb
example
of
in
the
commercial
history
of
the
films
is
the
march
of
the
moving
against
the
walls
of
babylon
in
griffith
intolerance
but
griffith
is
the
only
person
so
far
who
has
known
how
to
put
a
fighting
soul
into
a
moving
tower
the
only
real
war
that
has
occurred
in
the
films
with
the
greatest
war
going
on
outside
was
griffith
war
against
babylon
the
rest
was
news
chapter
xii
thirty
differences
between
the
photoplays
and
the
stage
the
argument
of
the
whole
of
the
edition
has
been
accepted
by
the
studios
the
motion
picture
magazines
and
the
daily
motion
picture
columns
throughout
the
land
i
have
read
hundreds
of
editorials
and
magazines
and
scarcely
one
that
differed
from
it
in
theory
most
of
them
read
like
paraphrases
of
this
work
and
of
all
arguments
made
the
one
in
this
chapter
is
the
one
oftenest
accepted
in
its
entirety
the
people
who
dominate
the
films
are
obviously
those
who
grew
up
with
them
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
merely
stage
actors
who
rushed
in
with
the
highest
tide
of
prosperity
now
have
to
take
second
rank
if
they
remain
in
the
films
but
most
of
these
have
gone
back
to
the
stage
by
this
time
with
their
managers
as
well
and
certainly
this
chapter
is
abundantly
proved
out
chapter
xiii
hieroglyphics
one
of
the
implications
of
this
chapter
and
the
one
preceding
is
that
the
fewer
words
printed
on
the
screen
the
better
and
that
the
ideal
film
has
no
words
printed
on
it
at
all
but
is
one
unbroken
sheet
of
photography
this
is
admitted
in
theory
in
all
the
studios
now
though
the
only
film
of
the
kind
ever
produced
of
general
popular
success
was
the
old
swimmin
hole
acted
by
charles
ray
if
i
remember
there
was
not
one
word
on
the
screen
after
the
cast
of
characters
was
given
the
whole
story
was
clearly
and
beautifully
told
by
photoplay
hieroglyphics
for
this
feature
alone
despite
many
defects
of
the
film
it
should
be
studied
in
every
art
school
in
america
meanwhile
title
writing
remains
a
commercial
necessity
in
this
field
there
is
but
one
person
who
has
won
distinction
anita
loos
she
is
one
of
the
four
or
five
important
and
thoroughly
artistic
brains
in
the
photoplay
game
among
them
is
the
distinguished
john
emerson
in
combination
with
john
emerson
director
producer
she
has
done
so
many
other
things
well
her
talents
as
a
title
writer
are
incidental
but
certainly
to
be
mentioned
in
this
place
the
outline
we
are
discussing
continues
through
iii
more
personal
speculations
and
afterthoughts
not
brought
forward
so
chapter
xiv
the
orchestra
conversation
and
the
censorship
in
this
chapter
on
page
i
suggest
suppressing
the
orchestra
entirely
and
encouraging
the
audience
to
talk
about
the
film
no
photoplay
people
have
risen
to
contradict
this
theory
but
it
is
a
chapter
that
once
caused
me
great
embarrassment
with
christopher
morley
the
author
of
shandygaff
and
other
temperance
literature
i
was
trying
to
prove
out
this
chapter
as
soon
as
the
orchestra
stopped
while
the
show
rolled
on
in
glory
i
talked
about
the
main
points
in
this
book
illustrating
it
by
the
film
before
us
almost
everything
that
happened
was
a
happy
illustration
of
my
ideas
but
there
were
two
shop
girls
in
front
of
us
awfully
in
love
with
a
certain
actor
who
insisted
on
kissing
the
heroine
every
so
often
and
with
her
apparent
approval
every
time
we
talked
about
that
those
shop
girls
glared
at
us
as
though
we
were
robbing
them
of
their
time
and
money
finally
one
of
them
dragged
the
other
out
into
the
aisle
and
dashed
out
of
the
house
with
her
dear
chum
saying
so
all
could
hear
well
come
on
terasa
we
might
as
well
go
if
these
two
talking
are
going
to
keep
this
up
behind
us
the
poor
voice
trembled
she
was
in
tears
she
was
gone
before
we
could
apologize
or
offer
flowers
so
i
say
in
applying
this
chapter
in
our
present
stage
of
civilization
sit
on
the
front
seat
where
no
one
can
hear
your
whisperings
but
mary
pickford
on
the
screen
she
is
but
a
shadow
there
and
will
not
mind
chapter
xv
the
substitute
for
the
saloon
i
leave
this
argument
as
a
monument
just
as
it
was
written
in
and
it
indicates
a
certain
power
of
forecasting
on
the
part
of
the
writer
we
drys
have
certainly
won
a
great
victory
some
of
the
photoplay
people
agree
with
this
temperance
sermon
and
some
of
them
do
not
the
wets
make
one
mistake
above
all
they
do
not
realize
that
the
drys
can
still
keep
on
voting
dry
with
intense
conviction
and
great
battle
cries
and
still
have
a
sense
of
humor
chapter
xvi
california
and
america
this
chapter
was
quoted
and
paraphrased
almost
bodily
as
the
preface
to
my
volume
of
verses
the
golden
whales
of
california
i
know
all
this
when
gipsy
fiddles
cry
a
song
of
some
length
recently
published
in
the
new
republic
and
the
london
nation
further
expresses
the
sentiment
of
this
chapter
in
what
i
hope
is
a
fraternal
way
and
i
hope
suggests
the
day
when
california
will
have
power
over
india
asia
and
all
the
world
and
plant
giant
redwood
trees
of
the
spirit
the
world
around
chapter
xvii
progress
and
endowment
i
allow
this
discourse
also
to
stand
as
written
in
and
it
shows
the
condition
just
before
the
war
better
than
any
new
words
of
mine
could
do
it
the
main
change
now
is
the
growing
hope
of
a
backing
not
only
from
universities
but
great
art
museums
chapter
xviii
architects
as
crusaders
the
sermon
in
this
chapter
has
been
carried
out
on
a
limited
scale
and
as
a
result
of
the
suggestion
or
from
pure
american
instinct
we
now
have
handsome
gasoline
filling
stations
from
one
end
of
america
to
the
other
and
really
gorgeous
ford
garages
our
union
depots
and
our
magazine
stands
in
the
leading
hotels
and
our
big
soda
fountains
are
more
and
more
attractive
all
the
time
having
recited
of
late
about
twice
around
the
united
states
and
continuing
the
pilgrimage
i
can
testify
that
they
are
all
alike
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
one
has
to
ask
the
hotel
clerk
to
find
out
whether
it
is
new
york
or
and
the
motion
picture
discipline
of
the
american
eye
has
had
a
deal
to
do
with
this
increasing
tendency
to
and
architectural
standardization
and
architectural
thinking
such
as
it
is
but
i
meant
this
suggestion
to
go
further
and
to
be
taken
in
a
higher
sense
so
i
ask
these
people
to
read
this
chapter
again
i
have
carried
out
the
idea
in
a
parable
perhaps
more
clearly
in
the
golden
book
of
springfield
when
i
speak
of
the
world
fair
of
the
university
of
springfield
to
be
built
one
hundred
years
hence
and
i
would
recommend
to
those
who
have
already
taken
seriously
chapter
eighteen
to
reread
it
in
two
towns
amply
worth
the
car
fare
it
costs
to
go
to
both
of
them
first
santa
fe
new
mexico
at
the
end
of
the
santa
fe
trail
the
oldest
city
in
the
united
states
the
richest
in
living
traditions
and
with
the
oldest
and
the
newest
architecture
in
the
united
states
not
a
stone
or
a
stick
of
it
standardized
a
city
with
a
soul
jerusalem
and
mecca
and
benares
and
thebes
for
any
artist
or
any
poet
of
america
future
or
any
one
who
would
dream
of
great
cities
born
of
great
architectural
photoplays
or
great
photoplays
born
of
great
cities
and
the
other
city
symbolized
by
the
golden
rain
tree
in
the
golden
book
of
springfield
is
new
harmony
indiana
that
was
the
greenwich
village
of
america
more
than
one
hundred
years
ago
when
it
was
yet
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
millions
of
miles
from
the
sea
it
has
a
tradition
already
as
dusty
and
wonderful
as
abydos
and
gem
aten
and
every
stone
is
still
eloquent
of
individualism
and
standardization
has
not
yet
set
its
foot
there
is
it
not
possible
for
the
architects
to
brood
in
such
places
and
then
say
to
one
another
build
from
your
hearts
buildings
and
films
which
shall
be
your
individual
hieroglyphics
each
according
to
his
own
loves
and
fancies
chapter
xix
on
coming
forth
by
day
this
is
the
second
egyptian
chapter
it
has
its
direct
relation
to
the
hieroglyphic
chapter
page
i
note
that
i
say
here
it
costs
a
dime
to
go
to
the
show
well
now
it
costs
around
thirty
cents
to
go
to
a
good
show
in
a
respectable
suburb
sometimes
fifty
cents
but
we
will
let
that
dime
remain
there
as
a
matter
of
historic
interest
and
pass
on
to
higher
themes
certainly
the
hieroglyphic
chapter
is
in
words
of
one
syllable
and
any
kindergarten
teacher
can
understand
it
chapter
nineteen
adds
a
bit
to
the
idea
i
do
not
know
how
warranted
i
am
in
displaying
egyptian
learning
newspaper
reporters
never
tire
of
getting
me
to
talk
about
hieroglyphics
in
their
relation
to
the
photoplays
and
always
give
me
respectful
headlines
on
the
theme
i
can
only
say
that
up
to
this
hour
every
time
i
have
toured
art
museums
i
have
begun
with
the
egyptian
exhibit
and
if
my
patient
guest
was
willing
lectured
on
every
period
on
to
the
present
time
giving
a
little
time
to
the
principal
exhibits
in
each
room
but
i
have
always
found
myself
returning
to
egypt
as
a
standard
it
seems
my
natural
classic
land
of
art
so
when
i
took
up
hieroglyphics
more
seriously
last
summer
i
found
them
extraordinarily
easy
as
though
i
were
looking
at
a
movie
in
a
book
i
think
egyptian
came
easy
because
i
have
analyzed
so
many
hundreds
of
photoplay
films
merely
for
recreation
and
the
same
style
of
composition
is
in
both
any
child
who
reads
one
can
read
the
other
but
of
course
the
literal
translation
must
be
there
at
hand
to
correct
all
wrong
guesses
i
figure
that
in
just
one
thousand
years
i
can
read
hieroglyphics
without
a
pony
but
meanwhile
i
tour
museums
and
i
ride
pharaoh
horse
and
suggest
to
all
photoplay
enthusiasts
they
do
the
same
i
recommend
these
two
books

the

of

of

which
are
indeed
the

of

referred
to
in
this
chapter
pages
it
is

and

warner
london
this
book
is
certainly
the
greatest
motion
picture
i
ever
attended
i
have
gone
through
it
several
times
and
it
is
the
only
book
one
can
read
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
on
the
pullman
when
he
is
making
hour
and
hour
jumps
from
town
to
town
american
civilization
grows
more
hieroglyphic
every
day
the
cartoons
of
darling
the
advertisements
in
the
back
of
the
magazines
and
on
the
and
in
the
the
acres
of
photographs
in
the
sunday
newspapers
make
us
into
a
hieroglyphic
civilization
far
nearer
to
egypt
than
to
england
let
us
then
accept
for
our
classic
land
for
our
standard
of
form
the
country
naturally
our
own
hieroglyphics
are
so
much
nearer
to
the
american
mood
than
the
rest
of
the
egyptian
legacy
that
americans
seldom
get
as
far
as
the
hieroglyphics
to
discover
how
congenial
they
are
seeing
the
mummies
good
americans
flee
but
there
is
not
a
man
in
america
writing
advertisements
or
making
cartoons
or
films
but
would
find
delightful
the
standard
books
of
hieroglyphics
sent
out
by
the
british
museum
once
he
gave
them
a
chance
they
represent
that
very
aspect
of
visual
life
which
europe
understands
so
little
in
america
and
which
has
been
expanding
so
enormously
even
the
last
year
for
instance
lasts
a
whole
week
now
with
mummers
on
the
streets

chapter

the
who
do
we
mean
by
the
we
mean
not
only
artists
such
as
are
named
in
this
chapter
but
dreamers
and
workers
like
johnny
appleseed
or
abraham
lincoln
the
best
account
of
johnny
appleseed
is
in
harper
monthly
for
november
people
do
not
know
abraham
lincoln
till
they
have
visited
the
grave
of
anne
rutledge
at
petersburg
illinois
then
new
old
salem
a
mile
away
new
old
salem
is
a
prophet
hill
on
the
edge
of
the
sangamon
with
lovely
woods
all
around
here
a
brooding
soul
could
be
born
and
here
the
dreamer
abraham
lincoln
spent
his
real
youth
i
do
not
call
him
a
dreamer
in
a
cheap
and
sentimental
effort
to
describe
a
man
of
aspiration
lincoln
told
and
interpreted
his
visions
like
joseph
and
daniel
in
the
old
testament
revealing
them
to
the
members
of
his
cabinet
in
great
trials
of
the
civil
war
people
who
do
not
see
visions
and
dream
dreams
in
the
good
old
testament
sense
have
no
right
to
leadership
in
america
i
would
prefer
photoplays
filled
with
such
visions
and
oracles
to
the
state
papers
written
by
practical
men
as
it
is
we
are
ruled
indirectly
by
photoplays
owned
and
controlled
by
men
who
should
be
in
the
and
trade
apparently
their
digestions
are
good
they
are
in
excellent
health
and
they
keep
out
of
jail
chapter
xxi
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
if
i
may
be
pardoned
for
referring
again
to
the
same
book
i
assumed
in
the
golden
book
of
springfield
illinois
that
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
would
come
for
my
city
beginning
november
and
that
up
to
that
time
amid
much
of
joy
there
would
also
be
much
of
thwarting
and
tribulation
but
in
the
beginning
of
that
mystic
november
the
soul
of
my
city
named
avanel
would
become
as
much
a
part
of
the
city
as
pallas
athena
was
athens
and
indeed
i
wrote
into
the
book
much
of
the
spirit
of
the
photoplay
outlined
pages
through
but
in
the
golden
book
i
changed
the
lady
the
city
worshipped
from
a
golden
image
into
a
living
breathing
young
girl
descendant
of
that
great
american
daniel
boone
and
her
name
obviously
avanel
boone
with
her
tribe
she
incarnates
all
the
mystic
ideals
of
the
boones
of
kentucky
all
this
but
a
prelude
to
saying
that
i
have
just
passed
through
the
city
of
santa
fe
new
mexico
it
is
a
santa
fe
full
of
the
glory
of
the
new
architecture
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
the
issuing
of
a
book
of
cowboy
songs
collected
and
many
of
them
written
by
howard
thorp
a
citizen
of
santa
fe
and
thrilling
with
the
issuing
of
a
book
of
poems
about
the
glory
of
new
mexico
this
book
is
called
red
earth
it
is
by
alice
corbin
henderson
and
santa
fe
is
full
of
the
glory
of
a
magnificent
state
capitol
that
is
an
art
gallery
of
the
whole
southwest
and
the
glories
of
the
studio
of
william
penhallow
henderson
who
has
painted
our
new
arabia
more
splendidly
than
it
was
ever
painted
before
with
the
real
character
thereof
and
no
theatricals
this
is
just
the
kind
of
a
town
i
hoped
for
when
i
wrote
my
first
draft
of
the
art
of
the
moving
picture
here
now
is
literature
and
art
when
they
become
one
art
as
of
old
in
egypt
we
will
have
new
mexico
hieroglyphics
from
the
hendersons
and
their
kind
and
their
surrounding
indian
pupils
a
basis
for
the
american
motion
picture
more
acceptable
and
more
patriotic
and
more
organic
for
us
than
the
egyptian
and
i
come
the
same
month
to
denver
and
find
a
new
art
museum
projected
which
i
hope
has
much
indeed
to
do
with
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
when
films
as
vital
as
the
santa
fe
songs
and
pictures
and
architecture
can
be
made
and
in
common
spirit
with
them
in
this
new
arabia
george
eggers
the
director
of
the
newly
projected
denver
art
museum
assures
me
that
a
photoplay
policy
can
be
formulated
amid
the
problems
of
such
an
all
around
undertaking
as
building
a
great
art
museum
in
denver
he
expects
to
give
the
photoplay
the
attention
a
new
art
deserves
especially
when
it
affects
almost
every
person
in
the
whole
country
so
i
prophesy
denver
to
be
the
museum
and
capital
of
new
arabia
as
santa
fe
is
the
artistic
architectural
and
song
capital
at
this
hour
and
i
hope
it
may
become
the
motion
picture
capital
of
america
from
the
standpoint
of
pure
art
not
manufacture
what
do
i
mean
by
new
arabia
when
i
was
in
london
in
the
fall
of
the
editor
of
the
landmark
the
organ
of
the
english
speaking
union
asked
me
to
draw
my
map
of
the
united
states
i
marked
out
the
various
regions
under
various
names
for
instance
i
called
the
coast
states
washington
oregon
and
california
new
italy
the
reasons
may
be
found
in
the
chapter
in
this
book
on
california
then
i
named
the
states
just
west
of
the
middle
west
and
east
of
new
italy
new
arabia
these
states
are
new
mexico
arizona
utah
colorado
wyoming
idaho
and
montana
these
are
the
states
which
carry
the
rocky
mountains
north
toward
the
aurora
borealis
and
south
toward
the
tropics
here
individualism
andrew
jacksonism
will
forever
prevail
and
american
standardization
can
never
prevail
in
cabins
that
can
not
be
reached
by
automobile
and
deserts
that
can
not
be
crossed
by
boulevards
the
john
the
baptists
the
hermits
and
the
prophets
can
strengthen
their
souls
here
are
lonely
places
as
sweet
for
the
spirit
as
was
little
old
new
salem
illinois
one
hundred
years
ago
or
the
wilderness
in
which
walked
johnny
appleseed
now
it
is
the
independence
of
spirit
of
this
new
arabia
that
i
hope
the
denver
art
museum
can
interpret
in
its
photoplay
films
and
send
them
on
circuits
to
the
art
museums
springing
up
all
over
america
where
sculpture
architecture
and
painting
are
now
constantly
sent
on
circuit
let
that
already
established
convention
the
be
applied
to
this
new
art
and
after
denver
has
shown
the
way
i
devoutly
hope
that
great
city
of
los
angeles
may
follow
her
example
consider
o
great
city
of
los
angeles
now
almost
the
equal
of
new
york
in
power
and
splendor
consider
what
it
would
do
for
the
souls
of
all
your
film
artists
if
you
projected
just
such
a
museum
as
denver
is
now
projecting
your
fate
is
coming
toward
you
denver
is
halfway
between
chicago
with
the
greatest
art
institute
in
the
country
and
los
angeles
the
natural
capital
of
the
photoplay
the
art
museums
of
america
should
rule
the
universities
and
the
photoplay
studios
as
well
in
the
art
museums
should
be
set
the
final
standards
of
civic
life
rather
than
in
any
musty
libraries
or
routine
classrooms
and
the
great
weapon
of
the
art
museums
of
all
the
land
should
be
the
hieroglyphic
of
the
future
the
truly
artistic
photoplay
and
now
for
book
two
at
length
it
is
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
films
first
proclaimed
in
and
never
challenged
or
overthrown
and
for
the
most
part
accepted
intact
by
the
photoplay
people
and
the
critics
and
the
theorists
as
well
book
ii
the
unchallenged
outline
of
photoplay
critical
method
chapter
i
the
point
of
view
while
there
is
a
great
deal
of
literary
reference
in
all
the
following
argument
i
realize
looking
back
over
many
attempts
to
paraphrase
it
for
various
audiences
that
its
appeal
is
to
those
who
spend
the
best
part
of
their
student
life
in
classifying
and
judging
and
producing
works
of
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
i
find
the
eyes
of
all
others
wandering
when
i
make
talks
upon
the
plastic
artist
point
of
view
this
book
tries
to
find
that
fourth
dimension
of
architecture
painting
and
sculpture
which
is
the
human
soul
in
action
that
arrow
with
wings
which
is
the
flash
of
fire
from
the
film
or
the
heart
of
man
or
pygmalion
image
when
it
becomes
a
woman
the
edition
was
used
by
victor
freeburg
as
one
of
the
in
the
columbia
university
school
of
journalism
in
his
classes
in
photoplay
writing
i
was
invited
several
times
to
address
those
classes
on
my
yearly
visits
to
new
york
i
have
addressed
many
other
academic
classes
the
invitation
being
based
on
this
book
now
i
realize
that
those
who
approach
the
theory
from
the
general
university
standpoint
or
from
the
history
of
the
drama
had
best
begin
with
freeburg
book
for
he
is
not
only
learned
in
both
matters
but
presents
the
special
analogies
with
skill
freeburg
has
an
excellent
education
in
the
history
of
music
and
some
of
the
happiest
passages
in
his
work
relate
the
photoplay
to
the
musical
theory
of
the
world
as
my
book
relates
it
to
the
general
art
museum
point
of
view
of
the
world
emphatically
my
book
belongs
in
the
art
institutes
as
a
beginning
or
in
such
religious
and
civic
bodies
as
think
architecturally
from
there
it
must
work
its
way
out
of
course
those
bodies
touch
on
a
thousand
others
the
work
is
being
used
as
one
basis
of
the
campaign
for
the
new
denver
art
museum
and
i
like
to
tell
the
story
of
how
george
eggers
of
denver
first
began
to
apply
the
book
when
the
director
of
the
art
institute
chicago
that
it
may
not
seem
to
the
merely
university
type
of
mind
a
work
of
lost
abstractions
one
of
the
most
gratifying
recognitions
i
ever
received
was
the
invitation
to
talk
on
the
films
in
fullerton
hall
chicago
art
institute
then
there
came
invitations
to
speak
at
chicago
university
and
before
the
fortnightly
club
chicago
all
around
one
difficulty
was
getting
the
film
to
my
case
from
out
the
commercial
whirl
i
talked
at
these
three
and
other
places
but
hardly
knew
how
to
go
about
crossing
the
commercial
bridge
at
last
with
the
cooperation
of
director
eggers
we
staged
in
the
sacred
precincts
of
fullerton
hall
mae
marsh
in
the
wild
girl
of
the
sierras
the
film
was
in
battered
condition
and
was
turned
so
fast
i
could
not
talk
with
it
satisfactorily
and
fulfil
the
principles
of
chapter
fourteen
but
at
least
i
had
converted
one
art
institute
director
to
the
idea
that
an
of
the
institute
could
not
only
write
a
book
about
but
the
painting
could
be
shown
in
an
art
museum
as
promise
of
greater
things
in
this
world
it
took
a
deal
of
will
and
breaking
of
precedent
on
the
part
of
all
concerned
to
show
this
film
the
wild
girl
of
the
sierras
and
i
retired
from
the
field
a
long
time
but
now
this
same
eggers
is
starting
in
denver
an
art
museum
from
its
very
foundations
but
on
the
same
constructive
scale
so
this
enterprise
in
my
fond
and
fatuous
fancy
is
associated
with
the
sweet
mae
marsh
as
the
wild
girl
of
the
sierras
one
of
the
loveliest
bits
of
poetry
ever
put
into
screen
or
fable
for
about
one
year
off
and
on
i
had
the
honor
to
be
the
photoplay
critic
of
the
new
republic
this
invitation
also
based
on
the
first
edition
of
this
book
looking
back
upon
that
experience
i
am
delighted
to
affirm
that
not
only
the
new
republic
constituency
but
the
world
of
the
college
and
the
university
where
i
moved
at
that
time
while
at
loss
for
a
policy
were
not
only
willing
but
eager
to
take
the
films
with
seriousness
but
when
i
was
through
with
all
these
dashes
into
the
field
and
went
back
to
reciting
verses
again
no
one
had
given
me
any
light
as
to
who
should
make
the
disinterested
film
for
these
immediate
times
the
film
that
would
class
in
our
civilization
with
the
new
republic
or
the
atlantic
monthly
or
the
poems
of
edwin
arlington
robinson
that
is
the
production
not
for
the
trade
but
for
the
soul
anita
loos
that
good
crusader
came
out
several
years
ago
with
the
flaming
announcement
that
there
was
now
hope
since
a
school
of
films
had
been
heavily
endowed
for
the
university
of
rochester
the
school
was
to
be
largely
devoted
to
producing
music
for
the
photoplay
in
defiance
of
chapter
fourteen
but
incidentally
there
were
to
be
motion
pictures
made
to
fit
good
music
neither
music
nor
films
have
as
yet
shaken
the
world
i
liked
this
rochester
idea
i
felt
that
once
it
was
started
the
films
would
take
their
proper
place
and
dominate
the
project
disinterested
films
to
be
classed
with
the
dramas
so
well
stimulated
by
the
great
drama
department
under
professor
baker
of
harvard
as
i
look
back
over
this
history
i
see
that
the
printed
page
had
counted
too
much
and
the
real
forces
of
the
visible
arts
in
america
had
not
been
definitely
enlisted
they
should
take
the
lead
i
would
suggest
as
the
three
people
to
interview
first
on
building
any
art
museum
photoplay
project
victor
freeburg
with
his
long
experience
of
teaching
the
subject
in
columbia
and
john
emerson
and
anita
loos
who
are
as
brainy
as
people
dare
to
be
and
still
remain
in
the
department
store
film
business
no
three
people
would
more
welcome
opportunities
to
outline
the
idealistic
possibilities
of
this
future
art
and
a
american
painter
was
talking
to
me
of
a
midnight
scolding
charlie
chaplin
gave
to
some
los
angeles
producer
in
a
little
restaurant
preaching
the
really
beautiful
film
and
denouncing
commerce
like
a
member
of
illustrious
army
and
i
have
heard
rumors
from
all
sides
that
charlie
chaplin
has
a
soul
he
is
the
comedian
most
often
proclaimed
an
artist
by
the
fastidious
and
most
often
forgiven
for
his
slapstick
he
is
praised
for
a
kind
of
henry
double
meaning
to
his
antics
he
is
said
to
be
like
one
of
henry
misquotations
of
the
classics
he
looks
to
me
like
that
artist
edgar
poe
if
poe
had
been
obliged
to
make
millions
laugh
i
do
not
like
chaplin
work
but
i
have
to
admit
the
good
intentions
and
the
enviable
laurels
let
all
the
art
museums
invite
him
in
as
tentative
adviser
if
not
a
chastened
performer
let
him
be
given
as
good
a
chance
as
mae
marsh
was
given
by
eggers
in
fullerton
hall
only
let
him
come
in
person
not
in
film
till
we
hear
him
speak
and
consider
his
suggestions
and
make
sure
he
has
eaten
of

chapter
ii
the
photoplay
of
action
let
us
assume
friendly
reader
that
it
is
eight
in
the
evening
when
you
make
yourself
comfortable
in
your
den
to
peruse
this
chapter
i
want
to
tell
you
about
the
action
film
the
simplest
the
type
most
often
seen
in
the
mind
of
the
habitué
of
the
cheaper
theatre
it
is
the
only
sort
in
existence
it
dominates
the
slums
is
announced
there
by
red
and
green
posters
of
the
melodrama
sort
and
retains
its
original
elements
more
deftly
handled
in
places
more
expensive
the
story
goes
at
the
highest
possible
speed
to
be
still
credible
when
it
is
a
poor
thing
which
is
the
case
too
often
the
vitus
dance
destroys
the
the
rhythmic
quality
of
the
is
twitched
to
death
in
the
bad
photoplay
even
the
picture
of
an
express
train
more
than
exaggerates
itself
yet
when
the
photoplay
chooses
to
behave
it
can
reproduce
a
race
far
more
joyously
than
the
stage
on
that
fact
is
based
the
opportunity
of
this
form
many
action
pictures
are
indoors
but
the
abstract
theory
of
the
action
film
is
based
on
the
chase
you
remember
the
first
one
you
saw
where
the
policeman
pursues
the
comical
tramp
over
hill
and
dale
and
across
the
town
lots
you
remember
that
other
where
the
cowboy
follows
the
horse
thief
across
the
desert
spies
him
at
last
and
chases
him
faster
faster
faster
and
faster
and
finally
catches
him
if
the
film
was
made
in
the
days
before
the
national
board
of
censorship
it
ends
with
the
cowboy
cheerfully
hanging
the
villain
all
details
given
to
the
last
kick
of
the
deceased
one
of
the
best
action
pictures
is
an
old
griffith
biograph
recently
reissued
the
story
entitled
man
genesis
in
the
time
when
had
no
weapons
impersonated
by
robert
harron
invents
the
stone
club
he
vanquishes
his
rival
impersonated
by
wilfred
lucas
strange
but
credible
manners
and
customs
of
the
are
detailed
they
live
in
picturesque
caves
their
gestures
are
wonderful
to
see
but
these
things
are
beheld
on
the
fly
it
is
the
chronicle
of
a
race
between
the
brain
of
and
the
body
of
the
other
symbolized
by
the
chasing
of
poor
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
until
the
climax
brain
desperately
triumphs
slays
with
the
startling
invention
he
wins
back
his
stolen
bride
impersonated
by
mae
marsh
it
is
a
griffith
masterpiece
and
every
actor
does
sound
work
the
audience
mechanical
americans
fond
of
crawling
on
their
stomachs
to
tinker
their
automobiles
are
eager
over
the
evolution
of
the
first
weapon
from
a
stick
to
a
hammer
they
are
as
full
of
curiosity
as
they
could
well
be
over
the
history
of
langley
or
the
wright
brothers
the
dire
perils
of
the
motion
pictures
provoke
the
ingenuity
of
the
audience
not
their
passionate
sympathy
when
in
the
minds
of
the
deluded
producers
the
beholders
should
be
weeping
or
sighing
with
desire
they
are
prophesying
the
next
step
to
one
another
in
worldly
george
ade
slang
this
is
illustrated
in
another
good
action
photoplay
the
dramatization
of
the
spoilers
the
original
novel
was
written
by
rex
beach
the
gallant
william
farnum
as
glenister
dominates
the
play
he
has
excellent
support
their
makes
them
worthy
of
chronicle
thomas
santschi
as
mcnamara
kathlyn
williams
as
cherry
malotte
bessie
eyton
as
helen
chester
frank
clark
as
dextry
wheeler
oakman
as
bronco
kid
and
jack
mcdonald
as
slapjack
there
are
in
the
spoilers
inspiriting
ocean
scenes
and
mountain
views
there
are
interesting
sketches
of
manners
and
customs
there
is
a
in
it
and
the
element
of
the
comradeship
of
loyal
pals
but
the
chase
rushes
past
these
things
to
the
climax
as
in
a
policeman
picture
it
whirls
past
blossoming
gardens
and
front
lawns
till
the
tramp
is
arrested
the
difficulties
are
commented
on
by
the
people
in
the
audience
as
boys
on
the
side
lines
comment
on
hurdles
cleared
or
knocked
over
by
the
men
running
in
college
the
sudden
into
side
branches
of
the
story
are
but
hurdles
also
not
plot
complications
in
the
stage
sense
this
is
as
it
should
be
the
pursuit
progresses
without
vitus
dance
or
hysteria
to
the
end
of
the
film
there
the
spoilers
are
discomfited
the
gold
mine
is
recaptured
the
incidental
girls
are
won
in
a
flash
by
the
rightful
owners
these
shows
work
like
the
express
elevators
in
the
metropolitan
tower
the
ideal
is
the
maximum
of
speed
in
descending
or
ascending
not
to
be
jolted
into
insensibility
there
are
two
girl
parts
as
beautifully
thought
out
as
the
parts
of
ladies
in
love
can
be
expected
to
be
in
action
films
but
in
the
end
the
love
is
not
much
more
romantic
in
the
eye
of
the
spectator
than
it
would
be
to
behold
a
man
on
a
motorcycle
with
the
girl
of
his
choice
riding
on
the
same
machine
behind
him
and
the
highest
type
of
action
picture
romance
is
not
attained
by
having
juliet
triumph
over
the
motorcycle
handicap
it
is
not
achieved
by
weaving
in
a
sherlock
holmes
plot
action
picture
romance
comes
when
each
hurdle
is
a
tableau
when
there
is
indeed
an
in
each
one
of
these
swift
glimpses
when
it
is
a
race
but
with
a
proper
and
grace
from
action
to
action
and
the
goal
is
the
most
beautiful
glimpse
in
the
whole
reel
in
the
action
picture
there
is
no
adequate
means
for
the
development
of
any
full
grown
personal
passion
the
distinguished
that
makes
genuine
the
personal
emotions
in
the
legitimate
drama
has
no
chance
people
are
but
types
swiftly
moved
chessmen
more
elaborate
discourse
on
this
subject
may
be
found
in
chapter
twelve
on
the
differences
between
the
films
and
the
stage
but
here
briefly
the
action
pictures
are
falsely
advertised
as
having
or
abounding
in
tragedy
but
though
the
actors
glower
and
wrestle
and
even
if
they
are
the
most
skilful
lambasters
in
the
profession
the
audience
gossips
and
chews
gum
why
does
the
audience
keep
coming
to
this
type
of
photoplay
if
neither
lust
love
hate
nor
hunger
is
adequately
conveyed
simply
because
such
spectacles
gratify
the
incipient
or
rampant
in
every
american
to
make
the
elevator
go
faster
than
the
one
in
the
metropolitan
tower
is
to
destroy
even
this
emotion
to
elaborate
unduly
any
of
the
agonies
or
seductions
in
the
hope
of
arousing
lust
love
hate
or
hunger
is
to
produce
on
the
screen
a
series
of
misplaced
figures
of
the
order
frankenstein
how
often
we
have
been
horrified
by
these
galvanized
and
ogling
corpses
these
are
the
things
that
cause
the
outcry
for
more
censors
it
is
not
that
our
moral
codes
are
insulted
but
what
is
far
worse
our
nervous
systems
are
temporarily
racked
to
pieces
these
wriggling
men
these
burglars
are
public
nuisances
no
worse
and
no
better
than
dead
cats
being
hurled
about
by
street
urchins
the
cry
for
more
censors
is
but
the
cry
for
the
man
with
the
broom
sometimes
it
is
a
matter
as
simple
as
when
a
child
is
scratching
with
a
pin
on
a
slate
while
one
would
not
have
the
child
locked
up
by
the
chief
of
police
after
five
minutes
of
it
almost
every
one
wants
to
smack
him
till
his
little
jaws
ache
it
is
the
very
of
the
proceeding
that
ruins
our
kindness
of
heart
and
the
best
action
film
is
impersonal
and
unsympathetic
even
if
it
has
no
scratching
pins
because
it
is
it
must
take
extra
pains
to
be
tactful
means
that
the
hero
as
we
see
him
on
the
screen
is
a
variety
of
amiable
or
violent
ghost
nothing
makes
his
lack
of
human
charm
plainer
than
when
we
as
audience
enter
the
theatre
at
the
middle
of
what
purports
to
be
the
most
passionate
of
scenes
when
the
goal
of
the
chase
is
unknown
to
us
and
the
alleged
situation
appeals
on
its
magnetic
merits
here
is
neither
the
psychic
telepathy
of
forbes
robertson
cæsar
nor
the
of
sothern
don
quixote
the
audience
is
not
worked
up
into
the
deadly
still
of
the
speaking
theatre
we
late
comers
wait
for
the
whole
reel
to
start
over
and
the
goal
to
be
indicated
in
the
preliminary
before
we
can
get
the
least
bit
wrought
up
the
prize
may
be
a
lady
heart
the
restoration
of
a
lost
reputation
or
the
ownership
of
the
patent
for
a
churn
in
the
more
effective
action
plays
it
is
often
what
would
be
secondary
on
the
stage
the
recovery
of
a
certain
glove
spade
or
and
to
begin
we
are
shown
a
picture
of
said
glove
spade
or
then
when
these
disappear
from
ownership
or
sight
the
suspense
continues
till
they
are
again
visible
on
the
screen
in
the
hands
of
the
rightful
owner
in
brief
the
actors
hurry
through
what
would
be
tremendous
passions
on
the
stage
to
recover
something
that
can
be
really
photographed
for
instance
there
came
to
our
town
long
ago
a
film
of
a
fight
between
federals
and
confederates
with
the
loss
of
many
lives
all
for
the
recapture
of
a
that
took
on
more
personality
in
the
end
than
private
or
general
on
either
side
alive
or
dead
it
was
based
on
the
history
of
the
very
engine
photographed
or
else
that
engine
was
given
in
replica
the
old
locomotive
was
full
of
character
and
humor
amidst
the
tragedy
leaking
steam
at
every
orifice
the
original
is
in
one
of
the
southern
civil
war
museums
this
engine
in
its
capacity
as
a
principal
actor
is
going
to
be
referred
to
more
than
several
times
in
this
work
the
highest
type
of
action
picture
gives
us
neither
the
quality
of
macbeth
or
henry
fifth
the
comedy
of
errors
or
the
taming
of
the
shrew
it
gives
us
rather
that
fine
and
special
quality
that
was
in
the
of
robert
louis
stevenson
that
brought
about
the
limitations
and
the
nobility
of
the
stories
of
kidnapped
treasure
island
and
the
new
arabian
nights
this
discussion
will
be
resumed
on
another
plane
in
the
eighth
chapter
having
read
thus
far
why
not
close
the
book
and
go
round
the
corner
to
a
photoplay
theatre
give
the
preference
to
the
cheapest
one
action
picture
will
be
inevitable
since
this
chapter
was
written
charlie
chaplin
and
douglas
fairbanks
have
given
complete
department
store
examples
of
the
method
especially
chaplin
in
the
brilliantly
constructed
shoulder
arms
and
fairbanks
in
his
one
great
piece
of
acting
in
the
three
chapter
iii
the
intimate
photoplay
let
us
take
for
our
platform
this
sentence
the
motion
picture
art
is
a
great
high
art
not
a
process
of
commercial
manufacture
the
people
i
hope
to
convince
of
this
are
the
great
art
museums
of
america
including
the
people
who
support
them
in
any
way
the
people
who
give
the
current
exhibitions
there
or
attend
them
the
art
school
students
in
the
corridors
below
coming
on
in
the
same
field
the
departments
of
english
of
the
history
of
the
drama
of
the
practice
of
the
drama
and
the
history
and
practice
of
art
in
that
amazingly
long
list
of
our
colleges
and
universities
to
be
found
for
instance
in
the
world
almanac
the
critical
and
literary
world
generally
somewhere
in
this
enormous
field
piled
with
endowments
mountain
high
it
should
be
possible
to
establish
the
theory
and
practice
of
the
photoplay
as
a
fine
art
readers
who
do
not
care
for
the
history
of
any
art
readers
who
have
neither
curiosity
nor
aspiration
in
regard
to
any
of
the
ten
or
eleven
muses
who
now
dance
around
apollo
such
shabby
readers
had
best
lay
the
book
down
now
shabby
readers
do
not
like
great
issues
my
poor
little
sermon
is
concerned
with
a
great
issue
the
clearing
of
the
way
for
a
critical
standard
whereby
the
ultimate
photoplay
may
be
judged
i
can
not
teach
ways
to
make
quick
money
in
the
movies
that
seems
to
be
the
delicately
implied
purpose
of
the
mass
of
books
on
the
photoplay
subject
they
are
indeed
a
sickening
array
freeburg
book
is
one
of
the
noble
exceptions
and
i
have
paid
tribute
elsewhere
to
john
emerson
and
anita
loos
they
have
written
a
crusading
book
and
many
crusading
articles
after
five
years
of
exceedingly
lonely
art
study
in
which
i
had
always
specialized
in
museum
exhibits
prowling
around
like
a
lost
dog
i
began
to
intensify
my
museum
study
and
at
the
same
time
shout
about
what
i
was
discovering
from
nineteen
hundred
and
five
on
i
did
orate
my
opinions
to
a
group
of
advanced
students
we
assembled
weekly
for
several
winters
in
the
metropolitan
museum
new
york
for
the
discussion
of
the
masterpieces
in
historic
order
from
egypt
to
america
from
that
standpoint
the
work
least
often
found
hardest
to
make
least
popular
in
the
street
may
be
in
the
end
the
one
most
treasured
in
a
as
a
counsellor
and
stimulus
of
mankind
throughout
this
book
i
try
to
bring
to
bear
the
same
simple
standards
of
form
composition
mood
and
motive
that
we
used
in
finding
the
fundamental
exhibits
the
standards
which
are
taken
for
granted
in
art
histories
and
schools
radical
or
conservative
anywhere
again
we
assume
it
is
eight
in
the
evening
friend
reader
when
the
chapter
begins
just
as
the
action
picture
has
its
photographic
basis
or
fundamental
metaphor
in
the
long
chase
down
the
highway
so
the
intimate
film
has
its
photographic
basis
in
the
fact
that
any
photoplay
interior
has
a
very
small
ground
plan
and
the
cosiest
of
enclosing
walls
many
a
scene
is
acted
out
in
a
space
no
bigger
than
that
which
is
occupied
by
an
office
boy
stool
and
hat
if
there
is
a
table
in
this
room
it
is
often
so
near
it
is
half
out
of
the
picture
or
perhaps
it
is
against
the
front
line
of
the
triangular
only
the
top
of
the
table
is
seen
and
nothing
close
up
to
us
is
pictured
below
that
we
in
the
audience
are
privileged
characters
generally
attending
the
show
in
bunches
of
two
or
three
we
are
members
of
the
household
on
the
screen
sometimes
we
are
sitting
on
the
near
side
of
the
family
board
or
we
are
gossiping
whispering
neighbors
of
the
shoemaker
we
will
say
with
our
noses
pressed
against
the
pane
of
a
metaphoric
window
take
for
contrast
the
stage
production
showing
the
room
and
work
table
of
a
shoemaker
as
it
were
the
whole
side
of
the
house
has
been
removed
the
shop
is
as
big
as
a
banquet
hall
there
is
something
essentially
false
in
what
we
see
no
matter
how
the
stage
manager
fills
in
with
old
boxes
broken
chairs
and
the
like
but
the
photoplay
interior
is
the
size
such
a
should
be
and
there
the
awl
and
pegs
and
bits
of
leather
speaking
the
silent
language
of
picture
writing
can
be
clearly
shown
they
are
sometimes
like
the
engine
in
chapter
two
the
principal
actors
though
the
photoplay
may
be
carried
out
of
doors
to
the
row
of
loafers
in
front
of
the
country
store
or
the
gossiping
streets
of
the
village
it
takes
its
origin
and
theory
from
the
snugness
of
the
interior
the
restless
reader
replies
that
he
has
seen
photoplays
that
showed
ballrooms
that
were
grandiose
not
the
least
cosy
these
are
to
be
classed
as
scenery
so
far
as
theory
goes
and
are
to
be
discussed
under
the
head
of
splendor
pictures
masses
of
human
beings
pour
by
like
waves
the
personalities
of
none
made
plain
the
only
definite
people
are
the
hero
and
heroine
in
the
foreground
and
maybe
one
other
though
these
three
be
in
the
little
triangle
they
occupy
next
to
the
camera
is
in
sort
an
interior
while
the

and
the

are
to
the
main
actor
as
is
the
forest
to
the
or
the
bending
grain
to

the
intimate
motion
picture
is
the
world
new
medium
for
studying
not
the
great
passions
such
as
black
hate
transcendent
love
devouring
ambition
but
rather
the
half
relaxed
or
gently
restrained
moods
of
human
creatures
it
gives
also
our
idiosyncrasies
it
is
gossip
it
is
apt
to
chronicle
our
petty
little
skirmishes
rather
than
our
feuds
in
it
colin
clout
and
his
comrades
return
the
intimate
photoplay
should
not
crowd
its
characters
it
should
not
choke
itself
trying
to
dramatize
the
whole
big
bloody
plot
of
lorna
doone
or
any
other
novel
with
a
dozen
leading
people
yet
some
gentle
episode
from
the
john
ridd
farm
some
when
lorna
and
the
doones
are
almost
forgotten
would
be
fitting
let
the
be
parading
its
best
and
annie
among
the
her
work
for
the
evening
well
nigh
done
the
vicar
of
wakefield
has
his
place
in
this
form
the
motion
picture
might
very
well
give
humorous
moments
in
the
lives
of
the
great
king
alfred
burning
the
cakes
and
other
legendary
incidents
of
him
plato
writings
give
us
glimpses
of
socrates
in
between
the
long
dialogues
and
there
are
intimate
scraps
in
plutarch
prospective
do
you
remember
landor
imaginary
conversations
and
lang
letters
to
dead
authors
can
you
not
attain
to
that
informal
understanding
in
pictorial
delineations
of
such
people
the
photoplay
has
been
unjust
to
itself
in
comedies
the
late
john
bunny
important
place
in
my
memory
comes
from
the
first
picture
in
which
i
saw
him
it
is
a
story
of
high
life
below
stairs
the
hero
is
the
butler
at
a
governor
reception
john
bunny
work
as
this
man
is
a
delightful
piece
of
acting
the
servants
are
growing
tipsier
downstairs
but
the
more
afraid
of
the
chief
functionary
every
time
he
appears
frozen
into
sobriety
by
his
glance
at
the
last
moment
this
god
of
the
basement
catches
them
at
their
worst
and
gives
them
a
condescending
but
forgiving
smile
the
lid
comes
off
completely
he
himself
has
been
imbibing
his
surviving
dignity
in
waiting
on
the
governor
guests
is
worthy
of
the
stage
of
goldsmith
and
sheridan
this
film
should
be
reissued
in
time
as
a
bunny
memorial
so
far
as
my
experience
has
gone
the
best
of
the
comedians
is
sidney
drew
he
could
shine
in
the
atmosphere
of
pride
and
prejudice
or
cranford
but
the
best
things
i
have
seen
of
his
are
far
from
such
i
beg
the
pardon
of
miss
jane
austen
and
gaskell
while
i
mention
who
who
in
hogg
hollow
and
a
regiment
of
two
over
these
i
rejoiced
like
a
yokel
with
a
pocketful
of
butterscotch
and
peanuts
the
opportunities
to
laugh
on
a
higher
plane
than
this
to
laugh
like
olympians
are
seldom
given
us
in
this
world
the
most
successful
motion
picture
drama
of
the
intimate
type
ever
placed
before
mine
eyes
was
enoch
arden
produced
by
cabanne
lillian
gish
takes
the
part
of
annie
alfred
paget
impersonates
enoch
arden
and
wallace
reid
takes
the
part
of
philip
ray
the
play
is
in
four
reels
of
twenty
minutes
each
it
should
have
been
made
into
three
reels
by
shortening
every
scene
just
a
bit
otherwise
it
is
satisfying
and
i
and
my
friends
have
watched
it
through
many
times
as
it
has
returned
to
springfield
the
mood
of
the
original
poem
is
approximated
the
story
is
told
with
fireside
friendliness
the
pale
lillian
gish
surrounded
by
happy
children
gives
us
many
a
genre
painting
on
the
theme
of
domesticity
it
is
a
photographic
rendering
in
many
ways
as
fastidious
as
versification
the
scenes
on
the
desert
island
are
some
of
them
commonplace
the
shipwreck
and
the
like
remind
one
of
other
photoplays
but
the
rest
of
the
production
has
a
mood
of
its
own
seen
several
months
ago
it
fills
my
and
more
than
that
particular
piece
of
tennyson
fills
and
perhaps
this
is
because
it
is
pleasing
to
me
as
a
theorist
it
is
a
sound
example
of
the
type
of
film
to
which
this
chapter
is
devoted
if
you
can
not
get
your
local
manager
to
bring
enoch
arden
reread
that
poem
of
tennyson
and
translate
it
in
your
own
mind
eye
into
a
gallery
of
six
hundred
delicately
toned
photographs
hung
in
logical
order
most
of
them
cosy
interior
scenes
some
of
the
faces
five
feet
from
chin
to
forehead
in
the
more
personal
episodes
yet
exquisitely
fair
fill
in
the
scenes
and
general
gatherings
with
the
appointments
of
an
idyllic
english
and
you
will
get
an
approximate
conception
of
what
we
mean
by
the
motion
picture
or
the
intimate
picture
as
i
generally
call
it
for
convenience
it
is
a
quality
not
a
defect
of
all
photoplays
that
human
beings
tend
to
become
dolls
and
mechanisms
and
dolls
and
mechanisms
tend
to
become
human
but
the
haughty
who
scorn
the
moving
pictures
can
not
rid
themselves
of
the
feeling
that
they
are
being
seduced
into
going
into
some
sort
of
a
show
and
they
think
that
of
course
one
should
not
take
seriously
anything
so
cheap
in
price
and
so
appealing
to
the
taste
but
it
is
very
well
to
begin
in
the
state
of
mind
and
reconcile
ourselves
to
it
and
then
like
good
democrats
await
discoveries
punch
and
judy
is
the
simplest
form
of
marionette
performance
and
the
marionette
has
a
place
in
every
street
in
history
just
as
the
dolls
house
has
its
corner
in
every
palace
and
cottage
the
french
in
particular
have
had
their
great
periods
of
puppet
shows
and
the
italian
tradition
survived
in
little
italy
in
new
york
for
many
a
day
and
i
will
mention
in
passing
that
one
of
pavlowa
unforgettable
dance
dramas
is
the
fairy
doll
prospective
why
not
spend
a
deal
of
energy
on
the
photoplay
successors
of
the
we
have
the
queen
of
the
marionettes
already
without
the
play
one
description
of
the
comedy
would
be
the
mary
pickford
kind
of
a
story
none
has
as
yet
appeared
but
we
know
the
mary
pickford
mood
when
it
is
gentlest
most
roguish
most
exalted
it
is
a
prophecy
of
what
this
type
should
be
not
only
in
the
actress
but
in
the
scenario
and
setting
mary
pickford
can
be
a
doll
a
village
belle
or
a
church
angel
her
powers
as
a
doll
are
hinted
at
in
the
title
of
the
production
such
a
little
queen
i
remember
her
when
she
was
a
village
belle
in
that
film
that
came
out
before
producers
or
actors
were
known
by
name
it
was
it
was
called
what
the
daisy
said
if
these
productions
had
conformed
to
their
titles
sincerely
with
the
highest
photoplay
art
we
would
have
had
two
more
examples
for
this
chapter
why
do
the
people
love
mary
not
on
account
of
the
daniel
frohman
style
of
handling
her
appearances
he
presents
her
to
us
in
what
are
almost
the
stage
terms
the
productions
energetic
and
full
of
painstaking
detail
but
dominated
by
a
dream
that
is
a
theatrical
hybrid
it
is
neither
good
moving
picture
nor
good
stage
play
yet
mary
could
be
cast
as
a
cloudy
olympian
or
a
church
angel
if
her
managers
wanted
her
to
be
such
she
herself
was
transfigured
in
the
dawn
of
tomorrow
but
the
of
that
play
was
merely
a
well
mounted
melodrama
why
do
the
people
love
mary
because
of
a
certain
aspect
of
her
face
in
her
highest
mood
botticelli
painted
her
portrait
many
centuries
ago
when
by
some
necromancy
she
appeared
to
him
in
this
phase
of
herself
there
is
in
the
chicago
art
institute
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
north
wall
a
noble
copy
of
a
fresco
by
that
painter
the
copy
by
macmonnies
it
is
very
near
the
winged
victory
of
samothrace
in
the
picture
the
muses
sit
enthroned
the
loveliest
of
them
all
is
a
startling
replica
of
mary
the
people
are
hungry
for
this
fine
and
spiritual
thing
that
botticelli
painted
in
the
faces
of
his
muses
and
heavenly
creatures
because
the
mob
catch
the
very
glimpse
of
it
in
mary
face
they
follow
her
night
after
night
in
the
films
they
are
never
quite
satisfied
with
the
plays
because
the
managers
are
not
artists
enough
to
know
they
should
sometimes
put
her
into
sacred
pictures
and
not
have
her
always
the
village
hoyden
in
plays
not
even
hoydenish
but
perhaps
in
this
argument
i
have
but
betrayed
myself
as
mary
infatuated
partisan
so
let
there
be
recorded
here
the
name
of
another
actress
who
is
always
in
the
mood
and
adapted
to
interiors
marguerite
clark
she
is
endowed
by
nature
to
act
in
the
same
film
the
village
pet
the
irrepressible
and
finally
the
shining
bride
of
twenty
but
no
production
in
which
she
acts
that
has
happened
to
come
under
my
eye
has
done
justice
to
these
possibilities
the
transitions
from
one
of
these
stages
to
the
other
are
not
marked
by
the
producer
with
sufficient
delicate
graduation
emphasis
and
contrast
her
plots
have
been
but
sugared
nonsense
or
swashbuckling
ups
and
downs
she
shines
in
a
bevy
of
girls
she
has
sometimes
been
given
the
bevy
but
it
is
easier
to
find
performers
who
fit
this
chapter
than
to
find
films
having
read
so
far
it
is
probably
not
quite
nine
in
the
evening
go
around
the
corner
to
the
nearest
theatre
you
will
not
be
apt
to
find
a
pure
example
of
the
moving
picture
but
some
one
or
two
scenes
will
make
plain
the
intent
of
the
phrase
imagine
the
most
winsome
tableau
that
passes
before
you
extended
logically
through
one
or
three
reels
with
no
melodramatic
interruptions
or
awful
smashes
for
a
further
discussion
of
these
smashes
and
other
items
in
this
chapter
read
the
ninth
chapter
entitled
chapter
iv
the
motion
picture
of
fairy
splendor
again
kind
reader
let
us
assume
it
is
eight
in
the
evening
for
purposes
of
future
climax
which
you
no
doubt
anticipate
just
as
the
action
motion
picture
has
its
photographic
basis
in
the
race
down
the
just
as
the
intimate
motion
picture
has
its
photographic
basis
in
the
interior
scene
so
the
photoplay
of
splendor
in
its
four
forms
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
kinetoscope
can
take
in
the
most
varied
of
landscapes
it
can
reproduce
fairy
dells
it
can
give
every
ripple
of
the
it
can
show
us
cathedrals
within
and
without
it
can
take
in
the
panorama
of
cyclopæan
cloud
bending
forest
mountain
in
like
manner
it
can
put
on
the
screen
great
impersonal
mobs
of
men
it
can
give
us
tremendous
armies
moving
as
oceans
move
the
pictures
of
fairy
splendor
crowd
splendor
patriotic
splendor
and
religious
splendor
are
but
the
embodiments
of
these
backgrounds
and
a
photographic
corollary
quite
useful
in
these
four
forms
is
that
the
camera
has
a
kind
of
this
power
is
the
subject
of
this
chapter
the
legends
and
revelations
of
men
in
connection
with
the
lovely
out
of
doors
or
lonely
shrines
or
derived
from
inspired
crusading
humanity
moving
in
masses
can
now
be
fitly
retold
also
the
fairy
wand
can
do
its
work
the
little
dryad
can
come
from
the
tree
and
the
spirits
that
guard
the
republic
can
be
seen
walking
on
the
clouds
above
the
but
we
are
concerned
with
the
humblest
voodooism
at
present
perhaps
the
world
oldest
motion
picture
plot
is
a
tale
in
mother
goose
it
ends
somewhat
in
this
fashion
the
old
lady
said
to
the
cat
cat
cat
kill
rat
rat

not

will

pig
pig
will
not
jump
over
the
stile
and
i
can
not
get
home
by
some
means
the
present
writer
does
not
remember
the
cat
was
persuaded
to
approach
the
rat
the
rest
was
like
a
tale
of
european
diplomacy
the
rat
began
to
gnaw
the
rope
the
rope
began
to
hang
the
butcher
the
butcher
began
to
kill
the
ox
the

began
to

the

the
fire
began
to

the
stick
the
stick
began
to
beat
the
dog
the
dog
began
to
bite
the
pig
the
frightened
little
pig
jumped
over
the
stile
and
the
old
lady
was
able
to
get
home
that
night
put
yourself
back
to
the
state
of
mind
in
which
you
enjoyed
this
bit
of
verse
though
the
photoplay
may
rise
to
exquisite
heights
it
begins
with
pictures
akin
to
this
rhyme
mankind
in
his
childhood
has
always
wanted
his
furniture
to
do
such
things
arthur
names
his
blade
excalibur
it
becomes
a
person
the
man
in
the
arabian
tale
speaks
to
the
magic
carpet
it
carries
him
whithersoever
he
desires
this
yearning
for
personality
in
furniture
begins
to
be
crudely
worked
upon
in
the
the
typical
commercialized
comedy
of
this
sort
is
moving
day
lyman
howe
among
many
excellent
reels
of
a
different
kind
has
films
allied
to
moving
day
but
let
us
examine
at
this
point
as
even
more
typical
an
old
pathé
film
from
france
the
representatives
of
the
are
sent
for
they
appear
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
an
astonishing
jump
they
are
told
that
this
household
desires
to
have
its
goods
and
hearthstone
gods
transplanted
two
streets
east
the
agents
salute
they
disappear
yet
their
wireless
orders
are
obeyed
with
a
military
crispness
the
books
and
newspapers
climb
out
of
the
window
they
go
soberly
down
the
street
in
their
wake
are
the
dishes
from
the
table
then
the
more
delicate
porcelains
climb
down
the
shelves
and
follow
then
follow
the
kitchen
dishes
then
the
chairs
then
the
clothing
and
the
carpets
from
over
the
house
the
most
joyous
and
curious
spectacle
is
to
behold
the
shoes
walking
down
the
boulevard
from
father
large
boots
to
those
of
the
youngest
child
they
form
a
complete
satire
of
the
family
yet
have
a
masterful
air
of
their
own
as
though
they
were
the
most
important
part
of
a
human
being
the
new
apartment
is
shown
everything
enters
in
procession
in
contrast
to
the
general
certainty
of
the
rest
one
or
two
pieces
of
furniture
grow
confused
trying
to
find
their
places
a
plate
in
leaping
upon
a
high
shelf
misses
and
falls
broken
the
broom
and
dustpan
sweep
up
the
pieces
and
consign
them
to
the
dustbin
then
the
human
family
comes
in
delighted
to
find
everything
in
order
the
moving
agents
appear
and
salute
they
are
paid
their
fee
they
salute
again
and
disappear
with
another
gigantic
leap
the
ability
to
do
this
kind
of
a
thing
is
fundamental
in
the
destinies
of
the
art
yet
this
resource
is
neglected
because
its
special
province
is
not
understood
people
do
not
like
to
be
tricked
the
manager
says
certainly
they
become
tired
of
mere
contraptions
but
they
never
grow
weary
of
imagination
there
is
possible
many
a
highly
imaginative
on
this
basis
if
we
revert
to
the
sound
principles
of
the
story
of
the
old
lady
and
the
pig
moving
day
is
at
present
too
crassly
material
it
has
not
the
touch
of
the
creative
imagination
we
are
overwhelmed
with
a
whole
van
of
furniture
now
the
mechanical
or
object
beginning
with
the
engine
in
the
second
chapter
is
apt
to
be
the
hero
in
most
any
sort
of
photoplay
while
the
producer
remains
utterly
unconscious
of
the
fact
why
not
face
this
idiosyncrasy
of
the
camera
and
make
the
object
the
hero
indeed
not
by
filling
the
story
with
ropes
buckets
and
sticks
but
by
having
these
four
unique
make
the
fire
the
loveliest
of
torches
the
water
the
most
graceful
of
springs
let
the
rope
be
the
humorist
let
the
stick
be
the
outstanding
hero
the
of
the

after

mabel
taliaferro
cinderella
seen
long
ago
is
the
best
film
the
present
writer
remembers
it
has
more
of
the
fireside
and
than
the
cinderella
of
mary
pickford
there
is
a
japanese
actor
sessue
hayakawa
who
takes
the
leading
part
with
blanche
sweet
in
the
clew
and
is
the
hero
in
the
film
version
of
the
typhoon
he
looks
like
all
the
actors
in
the
old
japanese
prints
he
has
a
general
dramatic
equipment
which
enables
him
to
force
through
the
stubborn
screen
such
stagy
plays
as
these
that
are
more
worth
while
in
the
speaking
theatre
but
he
has
that
atmosphere
of
pictorial
romance
which
would
make
him
a
valuable
man
for
the
retelling
of
the
old
japanese
legends
of
kwannon
and
other
tales
that
are
rich
unused
moving
picture
material
tales
such
as
have
been
hinted
at
in
the
gleaming
english
of
lafcadio
hearn
the
japanese
genius
is
eminently
pictorial
rightly
viewed
every
japanese
screen
or
bit
of
lacquer
is
from
the
ancient
asia
columbus
set
sail
to
find
it
would
be
a
noble
thing
if
american
experts
in
the
japanese
principles
of
decoration
of
the
school
of
arthur
dow
should
tell
stories
of
old
japan
with
the
assistance
of
such
men
as
sessue
hayakawa
such
things
go
further
than
peace
treaties
dooming
a
talent
like
that
of
hayakawa
to
the
task
of
interpreting
the
japanese
spy
does
not
conduce
to
accord
with
japan
however
the
technique
may
move
us
to
admiration
let
such
of
us
as
are
at
peace
get
together
and
tell
the
tales
of
our
happy
childhood
to
one
another
this
chapter
is
ended
you
will
of
course
expect
to
be
exhorted
to
visit
some
photoplay
emporium
but
you
need
not
look
for
they
are
much
harder
to
find
than
they
should
be
but
you
can
observe
even
in
the
advertisements
and
cartoons
the
technical
elements
of
the
story
of
the
old
lady
and
the
pig
and
you
can
note
several
other
things
that
show
how
much
more
quickly
than
on
the
stage
the
borderline
of
all
saints
day
and
can
be
crossed
note
how
easily
memories
are
called
up
and
appear
in
the
midst
of
the
room
in
any
plays
whatever
you
will
find
these
apparitions
and
recollections
the
dullest
hero
is
given
glorious
visualizing
power
note
the
fadeaway
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
reel
whereby
all
things
emerge
from
the
twilight
and
sink
back
into
the
twilight
at
last
these
are
some
of
the
indestructible
least
common
denominators
of
folk
stories
old
and
new
when
skilfully
used
they
can
all
exercise
a
power
over
the
audience
such
as
the
crystal
has
over
the
but
this
discussion
will
be
resumed
on
another
plane
in
the
tenth
chapter
furniture
trappings
and
inventions
in
motion
chapter
v
the
picture
of
crowd
splendor
henceforth
the
reader
will
use
his
discretion
as
to
when
he
will
read
the
chapter
and
when
he
will
go
to
the
picture
show
to
verify
it
the
shoddiest
silent
drama
may
contain
noble
views
of
the
sea
this
part
is
almost
sure
to
be
good
it
is
a
fundamental
resource
a
special
development
of
this
aptitude
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
gives
the
sea
of
humanity
not
metaphorically
but
literally
the
whirling
of
dancers
in
ballrooms
masses
of
people
in
balconies
political
ratification
meetings
ragged
glowering
strikers
and
gossiping
dickering
people
in
the
marketplace
only
griffith
and
his
close
disciples
can
do
these
as
well
as
almost
any
manager
can
reproduce
the
ocean
yet
the
sea
of
humanity
is
dramatically
to
the
pacific
atlantic
or
mediterranean
it
takes
this
new
invention
the
kinetoscope
to
bring
us
these
panoramic
by
the
law
of
compensation
while
the
motion
picture
is
shallow
in
showing
private
passion
it
is
powerful
in
conveying
the
passions
of
masses
of
men
bernard
shaw
in
a
recent
number
of
the
metropolitan
answered
several
questions
in
regard
to
the
photoplay
here
are
two
bits
from
his
discourse
strike
the
dialogue
from
molière
tartuffe
and
what
audience
would
bear
its
mere
imagine
the
scene
in
which
iago
poisons
othello
mind
against
desdemona
conveyed
in
dumb
show
what
becomes
of
the
difference
between
shakespeare
and
sheridan
knowles
in
the
film
or
between
shakespeare
lear
and
any
one
else
lear
no
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
interest
lies
in
the
new
opening
for
the
mass
of
dramatic
talent
formerly
disabled
by
incidental
deficiencies
of
one
sort
or
another
that
do
not
matter
in
the
failures
of
the
spoken
drama
may
become
the
stars
of
the
picture
palace
and
there
are
the
authors
with
imagination
visualization
and
verbal
gifts
who
can
write
novels
and
epics
but
can
not
for
the
life
of
them
write
plays
well
the
film
lends
itself
admirably
to
the
succession
of
events
proper
to
narrative
and
epic
but
physically
impracticable
on
the
stage
paradise
lost
would
make
a
far
better
film
than
ibsen
john
gabriel
borkman
though
borkman
is
a
dramatic
masterpiece
and
milton
could
not
write
an
effective
play
note
in
especial
what
shaw
says
about
narrative
epic
and
paradise
lost
he
has
in
mind
no
doubt
the
pouring
hosts
of
demons
and
angels
this
is
one
kind
of
a
crowd
picture
there
is
another
sort
to
be
seen
where
george
beban
impersonates
the
italian
in
a
film
of
that
title
by
thomas
ince
and
gardener
sullivan
the
first
part
taken
ostensibly
in
venice
delineates
the
festival
spirit
of
the
people
on
the
bridges
and
in
gondolas
it
gives
out
the
atmosphere
of
happiness
then
comes
the
vineyard
the
crowd
sentiment
of
a
merry
then
the
massed
emotion
of
many
people
embarking
on
an
atlantic
liner
telling
to
their
kindred
on
the
piers
then
the
drama
of
arrival
in
new
york
the
wonder
of
the
steerage
people
pouring
down
their
proper
gangway
is
contrasted
with
the
conventional
of
the
passengers
above
then
we
behold
the
seething
human
cauldron
of
the
east
side
then
the
jolly
little
then
the
life
of
the
east
side
from
the
policeman
to
the
and
including
the
bar
tender
for
the
crowd
is
treated
on
two
separate
occasions
it
is
hot
weather
the
mobs
of
children
follow
the
for
chips
of
ice
they
besiege
the
of
the
wagon
quite
closely
rejoicing
to
have
their
clothes
soaked
they
gather
round
the
that
is
turned
on
for
their
benefit
and
again
become
wet
as
drowned
rats
passing
through
these
crowds
are
george
beban
and
clara
williams
as
the
italian
and
his
sweetheart
they
owe
the
force
of
their
acting
to
the
fact
that
they
express
each
mass
of
humanity
in
turn
their
child
is
born
it
does
not
flourish
it
represents
in
an
acuter
way
another
phase
of
the
same
with
the
heat
that
the
gamins
indicate
in
their
pursuit
of
the
then
a
deeper
matter
the
hero
represents
in
a
fashion
the
adventures
of
the
whole
italian
race
coming
to
america
its
natural
southern
gayety
set
in
contrast
to
the
drab
east
side
the
gondolier
becomes
the
peasant
girl
becomes
the
suffering
slum
mother
they
are
not
specialized
characters
like
pendennis
or
becky
sharp
in
the
novels
of
thackeray
omitting
the
last
episode
the
entrance
into
the
house
of
corrigan
the
italian
is
a
strong
piece
of
work
another
kind
of
crowd
picture
is
the
battle
an
old
griffith
biograph
first
issued
in
before
griffith
name
or
that
of
any
actor
in
films
was
advertised
blanche
sweet
is
the
leading
lady
and
charles
west
the
leading
man
the
psychology
of
a
bevy
of
village
lovers
is
conveyed
in
a
lively
dance
then
the
boy
and
his
comrades
go
forth
to
war
the
lines
pass
between
crowds
of
friends
from
the
entire
neighborhood
these
friends
give
the
sense
of
patriotism
in
mass
then
as
the
consequence
of
this
feeling
as
the
special
agents
to
express
it
the
soldiers
are
in
battle
by
the
fortunes
of
war
the
onset
is
unexpectedly
near
to
the
house
where
once
was
the
dance
the
boy
is
at
first
a
coward
he
enters
the
old
familiar
door
he
appeals
to
the
girl
to
hide
him
and
for
the
time
breaks
her
heart
he
goes
forth
a
fugitive
not
only
from
battle
but
from
her
terrible
girlish
anger
but
later
he
rallies
he
brings
a
train
of
powder
wagons
through
fires
built
in
his
path
by
the
enemy
scouts
he
loses
every
one
of
his
men
and
all
but
the
last
wagon
which
he
drives
himself
his
return
with
that
ammunition
saves
the
day
and
through
all
this
glimpses
of
the
battle
are
given
with
a
splendor
that
only
griffith
has
attained
blanche
sweet
stands
as
the
representative
of
the
bevy
of
girls
in
the
house
of
the
dance
and
the
whole
body
social
of
the
village
how
the
costumes
flash
and
the
handkerchiefs
wave
around
her
in
the
battle
the
hero
represents
the
cowardice
that
all
the
men
are
resisting
within
themselves
when
he
returns
he
is
the
incarnation
of
the
hardihood
they
have
all
hoped
to
display
only
the
girl
knows
he
was
first
a
failure
the
wounded
general
honors
him
as
the
hero
above
all
now
she
is
radiant
she
can
not
help
but
be
triumphant
though
the
side
of
the
house
is
blown
out
by
a
shell
and
the
dying
are
everywhere
this
work
of
art
has
been
reissued
of
late
by
the
biograph
company
it
should
be
kept
in
the
libraries
of
the
universities
as
a
standard
films
are
unfortunate
in
this
sense
that
in
order
to
see
a
favorite
the
student
must
wait
through
five
other
reels
of
a
mixed
programme
that
usually
is
bad
that
is
the
reason
masterpieces
seldom
appear
now
the
producer
in
a
mood
to
make
a
special
effort
wants
to
feel
that
he
has
the
entire
evening
and
that
nothing
before
or
after
is
going
to
be
a
bore
or
destroy
the
impression
so
at
present
the
painstaking
films
are
apt
to
be
five
or
six
reels
of
twenty
minutes
each
these
have
the
advantage
that
if
they
please
at
all
one
can
see
them
again
at
once
without
sitting
through
irrelevant
slapstick
work
put
there
to
fill
out
the
time
but
now
having
the
whole
evening
to
work
in
the
producer
takes
too
much
time
for
his
good
ideas
i
shall
reiterate
throughout
this
work
the
necessity
for
restraint
a
one
hour
programme
is
long
enough
for
any
one
if
the
observer
is
pleased
he
will
sit
it
through
again
and
take
another
hour
there
is
not
a
good
film
in
the
world
but
is
the
better
for
being
seen
in
immediate
succession
to
itself
programmes
are
a
weariness
to
the
flesh
the
best
of
the
old
biographs
of
griffith
contained
more
in
twenty
minutes
than
these
ambitious
incontinent
displays
give
us
in
two
hours
it
would
pay
a
manager
to
hang
out
a
sign
this
show
is
only
twenty
minutes
long
but
it
is
griffith
great
film
battle
but
i
am
digressing
to
continue
the
contrast
between
private
passion
in
the
theatre
and
in
the
photoplay
let
us
turn
to
shaw
again
consider
his
illustration
of
iago
othello
and
lear
these
parts
as
he
implies
would
fall
flat
in
motion
pictures
the
minor
situations
of
dramatic
intensity
might
in
many
cases
be
built
up
the
crisis
would
inevitably
fail
iago
and
othello
and
lear
whatever
their
offices
in
their
governments
are
essentially
private
persons
individuals
if
you
go
to
a
motion
picture
and
feel
yourself
suddenly
gripped
by
the
highest
dramatic
tension
as
on
the
old
stage
and
reflect
afterward
that
it
was
a
fight
between
only
two
or
three
men
in
a
room
otherwise
empty
stop
to
analyze
what
they
stood
for
they
were
probably
representatives
of
groups
or
races
that
had
been
pursuing
each
other
earlier
in
the
film
otherwise
the
conflict
however
violent
appealed
mainly
to
the
sense
of
speed
so
in
the
birth
of
a
nation
which
could
better
be
called
the
overthrow
of
negro
rule
the
ku
klux
klan
dashes
down
the
road
as
powerfully
as
niagara
pours
over
the
cliff
finally
the
white
girl
elsie
stoneman
impersonated
by
lillian
gish
is
rescued
by
the
ku
klux
klan
from
the
mulatto
politician
silas
lynch
impersonated
by
george
seigmann
the
lady
is
brought
forward
as
a
typical
helpless
white
maiden
the
white
leader
ben
cameron
impersonated
by
henry
walthall
enters
not
as
an
individual
but
as
representing
the
whole
niagara
he
has
the
mask
of
the
ku
klux
klan
on
his
face
till
the
crisis
has
passed
the
wrath
of
the
southerner
against
the
blacks
and
their
northern
organizers
has
been
piled
up
through
many
previous
scenes
as
a
result
this
rescue
is
a
real
climax
something
the
photoplays
that
trace
strictly
personal
hatreds
can
not
achieve
the
birth
of
a
nation
is
a
crowd
picture
in
a
triple
sense
on
the
films
as
in
the
audience
it
turns
the
crowd
into
a
mob
that
is
either
for
or
against
the
reverend
thomas
dixon
poisonous
hatred
of
the
negro
griffith
is
a
chameleon
in
interpreting
his
authors
wherever
the
scenario
shows
traces
of
the
clansman
the
original
book
by
thomas
dixon
it
is
bad
wherever
it
is
unadulterated
griffith
which
is
half
the
time
it
is
good
the
reverend
thomas
dixon
is
a
rather
stagy
simon
legree
in
his
avowed
views
a
deal
like
the
gentleman
with
the
spiritual
hydrophobia
in
the
latter
end
of
uncle
tom
cabin
unconsciously
dixon
has
done
his
best
to
prove
that
legree
was
not
a
fictitious
character
joel
chandler
harris
harry
stillwell
edwards
george
cable
thomas
nelson
page
james
lane
allen
and
mark
twain
are
southern
men
in
griffith
class
i
recommend
their
works
to
him
as
a
better
basis
for
future
southern
scenarios
the
birth
of
a
nation
has
been
very
properly
denounced
for
its
simon
legree
qualities
by
francis
hackett
jane
addams
and
others
but
it
is
still
true
that
it
is
a
wonder
in
its
griffith
sections
in
its
handling
of
masses
of
men
it
further
illustrates
the
principles
that
made
notable
the
old
battle
film
described
in
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
the
battle
in
the
end
is
greater
because
of
its
and
concentration
all
packed
into
twenty
minutes
when
in
the
birth
of
a
nation
lincoln
impersonated
by
joseph
henabery
goes
down
before
the
assassin
it
is
a
he
falls
as
the
representative
of
the
government
and
a
thousand
high
and
noble
crowd
aspirations
the
mimic
audience
in
the
restored
ford
theatre
rises
in
panic
this
crowd
is
interpreted
in
especial
for
us
by
the
two
young
people
in
the
seats
nearest
and
the
freezing
horror
of
the
treason
sweeps
from
the
ford
theatre
audience
to
the
real
audience
beyond
them
the
real
crowd
touched
with
terror
beholds
its
natural
face
in
the
glass
later
come
the
pictures
of
the
rioting
negroes
in
the
streets
of
the
southern
town
mobs
splendidly
handled
tossing
wildly
and
rhythmically
like
the
sea
then
is
delineated
the
rise
of
the
ku
klux
klan
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
for
comment
on
the
musical
accompaniment
to
the
birth
of
a
nation
read
the
fourteenth
chapter
entitled
the
orchestra
conversation
and
the
censorship
in
the
future
development
of
motion

of
anger
and
joy

through
fanatical
and

whirlwinds
into
great
national
movements
of
anger
and
joy
a
book
by
gerald
stanley
lee
that
has
a
score
of
future
scenarios
in
it
a
book
that
might
well
be
dipped
into
by
the
reader
before
he
goes
to
such
a
play
as

italian

the
battle

of

of

of

of
these
titles
would
help
to
make
of
us
all
the
world
state
is
indeed
far
away
but
as
we
peer
into
the
mirror
screen
some
of
us
dare
to
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
pouring
streets
of
men
will
become
sacred
in
each
other
eyes
in
pictures
and
in
fact
a
further
discussion
of
this
theme
on
other
planes
will
be
found
in
the
eleventh
chapter
entitled
and
the
fifteenth
chapter
entitled

chapter
vi
patriotic
splendor
the
patriotic
picture
need
not
necessarily
be
in
terms
of
splendor
it
generally
is
beginning
the
chronicle
is
one
that
waves
no
banners
the
typhoon
a
film
produced
by
thomas
ince
is
a
story
of
the
japanese
love
of
nippon
in
which
a
very
little
of
the
landscape
of
the
nation
is
shown
and
that
in
the
beginning
the
hero
acted
by
sessue
hayakawa
living
in
the
heart
of
paris
represents
the
empire
he
is
making
a
secret
military
report
he
is
a
responsible
member
of
a
colony
of
japanese
gentlemen
the
bevy
of
them
appear
before
or
after
his
every
important
action
he
still
represents
this
crowd
when
alone
the
unfortunate
parisian
heroine
unable
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
the
fanatical
hearts
of
the
colony
ventures
to
think
that
her
love
for
the
japanese
hero
and
his
equally
great
devotion
to
her
is
the
important
human
relation
on
the
horizon
she
flouts
his
obscure
work
pits
her
charms
against
it
in
the
end
there
is
a
quarrel
the
irresistible
meets
the
immovable
and
in
madness
or
half
by
accident
he
kills
the
girl
the
youth
is
protected
by
the
colony
for
he
alone
can
make
the
report
he
is
the
representative
of
the
japanese
patriotic
formula
till
the
document
is
complete
a
new
arrival
in
the
colony
who
obviously
can
not
write
the
book
confesses
the
murder
and
is
executed
the
other
high
fanatic
dies
soon
after
of
a
broken
heart
with
the
completed
manuscript
volume
in
his
hand
the
one
impression
of
the
play
is
that
japanese
patriotism
is
a
peculiar
and
fearful
thing
the
particular
quality
of
the
private
romance
is
but
vaguely
given
for
such
things
in
their
rise
and
culmination
can
only
be
traced
by
the
novelist
or
by
the
gentle
alternations
of
silence
and
speech
on
the
speaking
stage
aided
by
the
hot
blood
of
players
actually
before
us
here
as
in
most
photoplays
the
attempted
in
pantomime
are
but
indifferent
things
the
details
of
the
hero
last
quarrel
with
the
heroine
and
the
precise
thoughts
that
went
with
it
are
muffled
by
the
inability
to
speak
the
power
of
the
play
is
in
the
adequate
style
the
man
represents
the
colony
sessue
hayakawa
should
give
us
japanese
tales
more
adapted
to
the
films
we
should
have
stories
of
iyeyasu
and
hideyoshi
written
from
the
ground
up
for
the
photoplay
theatre
we
should
have
the
story
of
the
ronin
not
a
japanese
stage
version
but
a
work
from
the
we
should
have
legends
of
the
various
clans
picturizations
of
the
code
of
the
samurai
the
typhoon
is
largely
indoors
but
the
patriotic
motion
picture
is
generally
a
landscape
this
is
for
deeper
reasons
than
that
it
requires
large
fields
in
which
to
manoeuvre
armies
flags
are
shown
for
other
causes
than
that
they
are
the
nominal
signs
of
a
love
of
the
native
land
in
a
comedy
of
the
history
of
a
newspaper
the
very
columns
of
the
publication
are
actors
and
may
be
photographed
oftener
than
the
human
hero
and
in
the
higher
realms
this
same
tendency
gives
particular
power
to
the
panorama
and
trappings
it
makes
the
natural
and
artificial
magnificence
more
than
a
narrative
more
than
a
something
other
than
a
drama
in
a
photoplay
by
a
master
when
the
american
flag
is
shown
the
thirteen
stripes
are
columns
of
history
and
the
stars
are
headlines
the
woods
and
the
templed
hills
are
their
printing
press
almost
in
a
literal
sense
going
back
to
the
illustration
of
the
engine
in
chapter
two
the
thing
is
a
personality
even
if
it
is
not
beautiful
when
it
takes
on
the
ritual
of
decorative
design
this
new
vitality
is
made
seductive
and
when
it
is
an
object
of
nature
this
seductive
ritual
becomes
a
new
pantheism
the
armies
upon
the
mountains
they
are
defending
are
rooted
in
the
soil
like
trees
they
resist
invasion
with
the
same
elementary
stubbornness
with
which
the
oak
resists
the
storm
or
the
cliff
resists
the
wave
let
the
reader
consider
antony
and
cleopatra
the
cines
film
it
was
brought
to
america
from
italy
by
george
klein
this
and
several
ambitious
spectacles
like
it
are
direct
violations
of
the
foregoing
principles
true
it
glorifies
rome
it
is
equivalent
to
waving
the
italian
above
the
egyptian
flag
quite
slowly
for
two
hours
from
the
stage
standpoint
the
magnificence
is
thoroughgoing
viewed
as
a
circus
the
acting
is
elephantine
in
its
grandeur
all
that
is
needed
is
pink
lemonade
sold
in
the
audience
the
famous
cabiria
a
tale
of
war
between
rome
and
carthage
by
is
a
prime
example
of
a
success
where
antony
and
cleopatra
and
many
european
films
founded
upon
the
classics
have
been
failures
with
obvious
defects
as
a
producer
appreciates
spectacular
symbolism
he
has
an
instinct
for
the
strange
and
the
beautifully
infernal
as
they
are
related
to
decorative
design
therefore
he
is
able
to
show
us
carthage
indeed
he
has
an
italian
patriotism
that
amounts
to
frenzy
so
rome
emerges
body
and
soul
from
the
past
in
this
spectacle
he
gives
us
the
cruelty
of
baal
the
intrepidity
of
the
roman
legions
everything
punic
or
italian
in
the
middle
distance
or
massed
background
speaks
of
the
very
genius
of
the
people
concerned
and
actively
generates
their
kind
of
lightning
the
principals
do
not
carry
out
the
momentum
of
this
immense
resource
the
half
a
score
of
leading
characters
with
the
costumes
gestures
and
aspects
of
gods
are
after
all
works
of
the
taxidermist
they
are
stuffed
gods
they
conduct
a
silly
nickelodeon
romance
while
carthage
rolls
on
toward
her
doom
they
are
like
sparrows
fighting
for
grain
on
the
edge
of
the
battle
the
doings
of
his
principals
are
sufficiently
evident
to
be
grasped
with
a
word
or
two
of
printed
insert
on
the
films
but
he
sentimentalizes
about
them
he
adds
of
the
plot
that
would
require
much
time
to
make
clear
and
a
hard
working
novelist
to
make
interesting
we
are
sentenced
to
stop
and
gaze
long
upon
this
array
of
printing
in
the
darkness
just
at
the
moment
the
tenth
wave
of
glory
seems
ready
to
sweep
in
but
one
hundred
words
can
not
be
a
photoplay
climax
the
climax
must
be
in
a
tableau
that
is
to
the
eye
as
the
rising
sun
itself
that
follows
the
thousand
flags
of
the
dawn
in
the
new
york
performance
and
presumably
in
other
large
cities
there
was
also
an
orchestra
behold
then
one
layer
of
great
photoplay
one
layer
of
bad
melodrama
one
layer
of
explanation
and
a
final
cement
of
music
it
is
as
though
in
an
art
museum
there
should
be
a
man
at
the
door
selling
masterly
about
the
paintings
and
a
man
with
a
violin
playing
the
catalogue
but
for
further
discourse
on
the
orchestra
read
the
fourteenth
chapter
i
left
cabiria
with
mixed
emotions
and
i
had
to
forget
the
distressful
few
eyes
submit
without
destruction
to
three
hours
of
film
but
the
mistakes
of
cabiria
are
those
of
the
pioneer
work
of
genius
it
has
in
it
twenty
great
productions
it
abounds
in
suggestions
once
the
classic
rules
of
this
are
established
men
with
equal
genius
with
and
no
more
devotion
will
give
us
the
masterpieces
as
it
is
the
background
and
must
stand
as
monumental
achievements
in
vital
patriotic
splendor
is
griffith
most
inspired
rival
in
these
things
he
lacks
griffith
knowledge
of
what
is
photoplay
and
what
is
not
he
lacks
griffith
simplicity
of
plot
he
lacks
his
action
the
italian
needs
the
american
health
and
clean
winds
he
needs
his
foregrounds
leading
actors
and
types
of
plot
but
the
american
has
never
gone
as
deep
as
the
italian
into
landscapes
that
are
their
own
tragedians
and
into
satanic
and
celestial
ceremonials
judith
of
bethulia
and
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
have
impressed
me
as
the
two
most
significant
photoplays
i
have
ever
encountered
they
may
be
classed
with
equal
justice
as
religious
or
patriotic
productions
but
for
reasons
which
will
appear
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
will
be
classed
as
a
film
of
devotion
and
judith
as
a
patriotic
one
the
latter
was
produced
by
griffith
and
released
by
the
biograph
company
in
the
original
stage
drama
was
once
played
by
the
famous

actress
nance
it
is
the
work
of
thomas
bailey
aldrich
the
motion
picture
scenario
when
griffith
had
done
with
it
had
no
especial
aldrich
flavor
though
it
contained
several
of
the
characters
and
events
as
aldrich
conceived
them
it
was
principally
the
old
apocryphal
story
plus
the
genius
of
griffith
and
that
inner
circle
of
players
whom
he
has
endowed
with
much
of
his
point
of
view
this
is

all
the

of

beautiful
judith
this
advertisement
should
be
compared
with
the
notice
of
your
girl
and
mine
transcribed
in
the
seventeenth
chapter
but
there
is
another
point
of
view
by
which
this
judith
of
bethulia
production
may
be
approached
however
striking
the
advertising
notice
there
are
four
sorts
of
scenes
alternated
the
particular
history
of
judith
the
gentle
courtship
of
nathan
and
naomi
types
of
the
inhabitants
of
bethulia
pictures
of
the
streets
with
the
population
flowing
like
a
sluggish
river
scenes
of
raid
camp
and
battle
interpolated
between
these
tying
the
whole
together
the
real
plot
is
the
balanced
alternation
of
all
the
elements
so
many
minutes
of
one
then
so
many
minutes
of
another
as
was
proper
very
little
of
the
tale
was
thrown
on
the
screen
in
reading
matter
and
no
climax
was
ever
a
printed
word
but
always
an
enthralling
tableau
the
particular
history
of
judith
begins
with
the
picture
of
her
as
the
devout
widow
she
is
austerely
garbed
at
prayer
for
her
city
in
her
own
quiet
house
then
later
she
is
shown
decked
for
the
eyes
of
man
in
the
camp
of
holofernes
where
all
is
assyrian
glory
judith
struggles
between
her
unexpected
love
for
the
dynamic
general
and
the
resolve
to
destroy
him
that
brought
her
there
in
either
type
of
scene
the
first
gray
and
silver
the
other
painted
with
paul
veronese
splendor
judith
moves
with
a
delicate
deliberation
over
her
face
the
emotions
play
like
winds
on
a
meadow
lake
holofernes
is
the
composite
picture
of
all
the
biblical
heathen
chieftains
his
every
action
breathes
power
he
is
an
assyrian
bull
a
winged
lion
and
a
god
at
the
same
time
and
divine
honors
are
paid
to
him
every
moment
nathan
and
naomi
are
two
arcadian
lovers
in
their
shy
meetings
they
express
the
life
of
the
normal
bethulia
they
are
seen
among
the
reapers
outside
the
city
or
at
the
well
near
the
wall
or
on
the
streets
of
the
ancient
town
they
are
generally
doing
the
things
the
crowd
behind
them
is
doing
meanwhile
evolving
their
own
little
heart
affair
finally
when
the
assyrian
comes
down
like
a
wolf
on
the
fold
the
gentle
naomi
becomes
a
prisoner
in
holofernes
camp
she
is
in
the
foreground
a
representative
of
the
crowd
of
prisoners
nathan
is
photographed
on
the
wall
as
the
particular
defender
of
the
town
in
whom
we
are
most
interested
the
pictures
of
the
crowd
normal
activities
avoid
jerkiness
and
haste
they
do
not
abound
in
the
boresome
quietude
that
some
producers
have
substituted
for
the
usual
twitching
each
actor
in
the
assemblies
has
a
refreshing
equipment
in
gentle
gesticulation
for
the
manners
and
customs
of
bethulia
must
needs
be
different
from
those
of
america
though
the
population
moves
together
as
a
river
each
citizen
is
quite
preoccupied
to
the
furthest
corner
of
the
picture
they
are
egotistical
as
human
beings
the
elder
goes
by
in
theological
conversation
with
his
friend
he
thinks
his
theology
is
important
the
mother
goes
by
all
absorbed
in
her
child
to
her
it
is
the
only
child
in
the
world
alternated
with
these
scenes
is
the
terrible
rush
of
the
assyrian
army
on
to
exploration
battle
and
glory
the
speed
of
their
setting
out
becomes
actual
because
it
is
contrasted
with
the
deliberation
of
the
jewish
town
at
length
the
assyrians
are
along
those
hills
and
valleys
and
below
the
wall
of
defence
the
population
is
on
top
of
the
battlements
beating
them
back
the
more
desperately
because
they
are
separated
from
the
the
wells
in
the
fields
where
once
the
lovers
met
in
a
lull
in
the
siege
by
a
connivance
of
the
elders
judith
is
let
out
of
a
little
door
in
the
wall
and
while
the
fortune
of
her
people
is
most
desperate
she
is
shown
in
the
quiet
shelter
of
the
tent
of
holofernes
sinuous
in
grace
tranced
passionately
in
love
she
has
forgotten
her
peculiar
task
she
is
in
a
sense
bethulia
itself
the
race
of
israel
made
over
into
a
woman
while
holofernes
is
the
embodiment
of
the
besieging
army
though
in
a
quiet
tent
and
on
the
terms
of
love
it
is
the
essential
warfare
of
the
hot
assyrian
blood
and
the
pure
and
peculiar
jewish
thoroughbredness
blanche
sweet
as
judith
is
indeed
dignified
and
ensnaring
the
more
so
because
in
her
abandoned
quarter
of
an
hour
the
jewish
sanctity
does
not
leave
her
and
her
aged
woman
attendant
coming
in
and
out
sentinel
and
conscience
with
austere
face
and
lifted
finger
symbolizes
the
fire
of
israel
that
shall
yet
awaken
within
her
when
her
love
for
her
city
and
god
finally
becomes
paramount
she
shakes
off
the
spell
of
the
divine
honors
which
she
has
followed
all
the
camp
in
according
to
that
living
heathen
deity
holofernes
and
by
the
very
transfiguration
of
her
figure
and
countenance
we
know
that
the
deliverance
of
israel
is
at
hand
she
beheads
the
dark
assyrian
soon
she
is
back
in
the
city
by
way
of
the
little
gate
by
which
she
emerged
the
elders
receive
her
and
her
bloody
trophy
the
people
who
have
been
dying
of
thirst
arise
in
a
final
whirlwind
of
courage
bereft
of
their
military
genius
the
assyrians
flee
from
the
burning
camp
naomi
is
delivered
by
her
lover
nathan
this
act
is
taken
by
the
audience
as
a
type
of
the
setting
free
of
all
the
captives
then
we
have
the
final
return
of
the
citizens
to
their
town
as
for
judith
hers
is
no
crass
triumph
she
is
shown
in
her
gray
and
silvery
room
in
her
former
widow
dress
but
not
the
same
woman
there
is
thwarted
love
in
her
face
the
sword
of
sorrow
is
there
but
there
is
also
the
prayer
of
thanksgiving
she
goes
forth
she
is
hailed
as
her
city
deliverer
she
stands
among
the
nobles
like
a
holy
candle
providing
the
picture
may
be
preserved
in
its
original
delicacy
it
has
every
chance
to
retain
a
place
in
the
affections
of
the
wise
if
a
humble
pioneer
of
criticism
may
speak
his
honest
mind
though
in
this
story
the
archaic
flavor
is
the
way
the
producer
has
pictured
the
population
at
peace
in
battle
in
despair
in
victory
gives
me
hope
that
he
or
men
like
unto
him
will
illustrate
the
american
patriotic
we
must
have
whitmanesque
scenarios
based
on
moods
akin
to
that
of
the
poem
by
blue
ontario
shore
the
possibility
of
showing
the
entire
american
population
its
own
face
in
the
mirror
screen
has
at
last
come
whitman
brought
the
idea
of
democracy
to
our
sophisticated
literati
but
did
not
persuade
the
democracy
itself
to
read
his
democratic
poems
sooner
or
later
the
kinetoscope
will
do
what
he
could
not
bring
the
nobler
side
of
the
equality
idea
to
the
people
who
are
so
crassly
equal
the
photoplay
penetrates
in
our
land
to
the
haunts
of
the
wildest
or
the
dullest
the
isolated
prospector
rides
twenty
miles
to
see
the
same
film
that
is
displayed
on
broadway
there
is
not
a
civilized
or
land
but
may
read
the
whitmanesque
message
in
time
if
once
it
is
put
on
the
films
with
power
photoplay
theatres
are
set
up
in
ports
where
sailors
revel
in
heathen
towns
where
gentlemen
adventurers
are
willing
to
make
one
last
throw
with
fate
on
the
other
hand
as
a
recorder
whitman
approaches
the
wildest
rawest
american
material
and
conquers
it
at
the
same
time
keeping
his
nerves
in
the
state
in
which
swinburne
wrote
only
the
song
of
secret
bird
or
lanier
composed
the
ballad
of
trees
and
the
master
portrait
of
whitman
in
the
metropolitan
museum
new
york
is
not
too
sophisticated
the
profoundness
of
this
poet
is
far
richer
than
one
will
realize
unless
he
has
just
returned
from
some
adventure
afoot
then
if
one
reads
breathlessly
by
the
page
and
the
score
of
pages
there
is
a
glory
transcendent
for
films
of
american
patriotism
to
parallel
the
splendors
of
cabiria
and
judith
of
bethulia
and
to
excel
them
let
us
have
whitmanesque
scenarios
based
on
moods
like
that
of
by
blue
ontario
shore
the
salute
au
monde
and
the
passage
to
india
then
the
people
message
will
reach
the
people
at
last
the
average
crowd
picture
will
cling
close
to
the
streets
that
are
and
the
usual
patriotic
picture
will
but
remind
us
of
nationality
as
it
is
at
present
conceived
and
aflame
and
the
religious
picture
will
for
the
most
part
be
close
to
the
standard
orthodoxies
the
final
forms
of
these
merge
into
each
other
though
they
approach
the
heights
by
different
avenues
we
americans
should
look
for
the
great
photoplay
of
that
will
mark
a
decade
or
a
century
that
prophesies
of
the
flags
made
one
the
crowds
in
brotherhood
chapter
vii
religious
splendor
as
far
as
the
photoplay
is
concerned
religious
emotion
is
a
form
of
in
the
most
conventional
and
rigid
church
sense
this
phase
can
be
conveyed
more
adequately
by
the
motion
picture
than
by
the
stage
there
is
little
of
course
for
the
in
the
anywhere
the
thing
that
makes
cathedrals
real
shrines
in
the
eye
of
the
reverent
traveller
makes
them
with
their
religious
processions
and
the
like
impressive
in
for
instance
i
have
long
remembered
the
essentials
of
the
film
the
death
of
thomas
becket
it
may
not
compare
in
technique
with
some
of
our
present
moving
picture
achievements
but
the
idea
must
have
been
particularly
adapted
to
the
film
medium
the
story
has
stayed
in
my
mind
with
great
persistence
not
only
as
a
narrative
but
as
the
first
hint
to
me
that
orthodox
religious
feeling
has
here
an
undeveloped
field
green
tells
the
story
in
this
way
in
his
history
of
the
english
people
four
knights
of
the
king
court
stirred
to
outrage
by
a
passionate
outburst
of
their
master
wrath
crossed
the
sea
and
on
the
of
december
forced
their
way
into
the
archbishop
palace
after
a
stormy
parley
with
him
in
his
chamber
they
withdrew
to
arm
thomas
was
hurried
by
his
clerks
into
the
cathedral
but
as
he
reached
the
steps
leading
from
the
transept
into
the
choir
his
pursuers
burst
in
from
the
cloisters
cried
reginald
fitzurse
the
traitor
thomas
becket
am
i
no
traitor
but
a
priest
of
god
he
replied
and
again
descending
the
steps
he
placed
himself
with
his
back
against
a
pillar
and
fronted
his
foes
the
brutal
murder
was
received
with
a
thrill
of
horror
throughout
christendom
miracles
were
wrought
at
the
martyr
tomb
etc
it
is
one
of
the
few
deaths
in
moving
pictures
that
have
given
me
the
sense
that
i
was
watching
a
tragedy
most
of
them
affect
one
if
they
have
any
effect
like
exhibits
in
an
art
gallery
as
does
josef
oil
painting
alone
in
the
world
we
admire
the
technique
and
as
for
emotion
we
feel
the
picturesqueness
only
but
here
the
church
procession
the
robes
the
candles
the
vaulting
overhead
the
whole
visualized
cathedral
mood
has
the
power
over
the
reverent
eye
it
has
in
life
and
a
touch
more
it
is
not
a
private
citizen
who
is
struck
down
such
a
taking
off
would
have
been
but
nominally
impressive
no
matter
how
well
acted
private
deaths
in
the
films
to
put
it
another
way
are
but
narrative
statements
it
is
not
easy
to
convey
their
spiritual
significance
take
for
instance
the
death
of
john
goderic
in
the
film
version
of
gilbert
parker
the
seats
of
the
mighty
the
major
leaves
this
world
in
the
first
third
of
the
story
the
photoplay
use
of
his
death
is
that
he
may
whisper
in
the
ear
of
robert
moray
to
keep
certain
letters
of
la
pompadour
well
hidden
the
fact
that
it
is
the
desire
of
a
dying
man
gives
sharpness
to
his
request
later
in
the
story
moray
is
by
the
villain
for
those
same
papers
then
the
scene
of
the
death
is
flashed
for
an
instant
on
the
screen
representing
the
hero
memory
of
the
event
it
is
as
though
he
should
recollect
and
renew
a
solemn
oath
the
documents
are
more
important
than
john
goderic
his
departure
is
but
one
of
their
attributes
so
it
is
in
any
film
there
is
no
emotional
stimulation
in
the
final
departure
of
a
character
to
bring
tears
such
tears
as
have
been
provoked
by
the
novel
or
the
stage
over
the
death
of
sidney
carton
or
faust
marguerite
or
the
like
all
this
to
make
sharper
the
fact
that
the
murder
of
becket
the
archbishop
is
a
climax
the
great
church
and
hierarchy
are
profaned
the
audience
feels
the
same
thrill
of
horror
that
went
through
christendom
we
understand
why
miracles
were
wrought
at
the
martyr
tomb
in
the
motion
pictures
the
entrance
of
a
child
into
the
world
is
a
mere
family
episode
not
a
climax
when
it
is
the
history
of
private
people
for
instance
several
little
strangers
come
into
the
story
of
enoch
arden
they
add
beauty
and
are
links
in
the
chain
of
events
still
they
are
only
one
of
many
elements
of
idyllic
charm
in
the
village
of
annie
something
that
in
real
life
is
less
valuable
than
a
child
is
the
goal
of
each
tiny
tableau
some
coming
or
departure
or
the
like
that
affects
the
total
plot
but
let
us
imagine
a
production
that
would
chronicle
the
promise
to
abraham
and
the
vision
that
came
with
it
let
the
film
show
the
final
gift
of
isaac
to
the
aged
sarah
even
the
boy
who
is
the
beginning
of
a
race
that
shall
be
as
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
sands
of
the
sea
for
multitude
this
could
be
made
a
pageant
of
power
and
glory
the
patriotic
fires
and
religious
exaltations
on
which
it
turns
could
be
given
in
noble
procession
and
the
tiny
fellow
on
the
pillow
made
the
mystic
centre
of
the
whole
the
story
of
the
coming
of
samuel
the
dedicated
little
prophet
might
be
told
on
similar
terms
the
real
death
in
the
photoplay
is
the
ritualistic
death
the
real
birth
is
the
ritualistic
birth
and
the
cathedral
mood
of
the
motion
picture
which
goes
with
these
and
is
close
to
these
in
many
of
its
phases
is
an
inexhaustible
resource
the
film
corporations
fear
religious
questions
lest
offence
be
given
to
this
sect
or
that
so
let
such
denominations
as
are
in
the
habit
of
cooperating
themselves
take
over
this
medium
not
gingerly
but
as
in
mediæval
time
the
hierarchy
strengthened
its
hold
on
the
people
with
the
marvels
of
romanesque
and
gothic
architecture
this
matter
is
further
discussed
in
the
seventeenth
chapter
entitled
progress
and
endowment
but
there
is
a
field
wherein
the
commercial
man
will
not
be
accused
of
heresy
or
sacrilege
which
builds
on
ritualistic
birth
and
death
and
elements
akin
thereto
this
the
established
producer
may
enter
without
fear
which
brings
us
to
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
issued
by
the
american
vitagraph
company
in
this
film
should
be
studied
in
the
high
schools
and
universities
till
the
canons
of
art
for
which
it
stands
are
established
in
america
the
director
was
larry
trimble
all
honor
to
him
the
patriotism
of
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
if
taken
literally
deals
with
certain
aspects
of
the
civil
war
but
the
picture
is
transfigured
by
so
marked
a
devotion
that
it
is
the
main
illustration
in
this
work
of
the
religious
photoplay
the
beginning
shows
president
lincoln
in
the
white
house
brooding
over
the
lack
of
response
to
his
last
call
for
troops
he
is
impersonated
by
ralph
ince
he
and
julia
ward
howe
are
looking
out
of
the
window
on
a
recruiting
headquarters
that
is
not
busy
howe
is
impersonated
by
julia
s
gordon
another
scene
shows
an
old
mother
in
the
west
refusing
to
let
her
son
enlist
this
woman
is
impersonated
by
mrs
maurice
the
father
has
died
in
the
war
the
sword
hangs
on
the
wall
later
julia
ward
howe
is
shown
in
her
room
asleep
at
midnight
then
rising
in
a
trance
and
writing
the
battle
hymn
at
a
table
by
the
bed
the
pictures
that
might
possibly
have
passed
before
her
mind
during
the
trance
are
thrown
upon
the
screen
the
phrases
they
illustrate
are
not
in
the
final
order
of
the
poem
but
in
the
possible
sequence
in
which
they
went
on
the
paper
in
the
first
sketch
the
dream
panorama
is
not
a
literal
discussion
of
abolitionism
or
states
rights
it
illustrates
rather
the
hebraic
exultation
applied
to
all
lands
and
times
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
glory
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
a
gracious
picture
of
the
nativity
edith
storey
impersonates
mary
the
virgin
i
have
seen
him
in
the
watchfires
of
a
hundred
circling
camps
and
they
have
builded
him
an
altar
in
the
evening
dews
and
damps
for
these
are
given
symbolic
pageants
of
the
holy
sepulchre
crusaders
then
there
is
a
visible
parable
showing
a
marketplace
in
some
wicked
capital
neither
babylon
tyre
nor
nineveh
but
all
of
them
in
essential
character
first
come
spectacles
of
rejoicing
cruelty
and
waste
then
from
heaven
descend
flood
and
fire
brimstone
and
lightning
it
is
like
the
judgment
of
the
cities
of
the
plain
just
before
the
overthrow
the
line
is
projected
upon
the
screen
he
hath
loosed
the
fateful
lightning
of
his
terrible
swift
sword
then
the
heavenly
host
becomes
gradually
visible
upon
the
air
marching
toward
the
audience
almost
crossing
the
footlights
and
blowing
their
solemn
trumpets
with
this
picture
the
line
is
given
us
to
read
our
god
is
marching
on
this
host
appears
in
the
photoplay
as
often
as
the
refrain
sweeps
into
the
poem
the
celestial
company
its
imperceptible
emergence
its
spiritual
power
when
in
the
ascendant
is
a
thing
never
to
be
forgotten
a
tableau
that
proves
the
motion
picture
a
great
religious
instrument
then
comes
a
procession
indeed
it
is
as
though
the
audience
were
standing
at
the
side
of
the
throne
at
doomsday
looking
down
the
hill
of
zion
toward
the
little
earth
there
is
a
line
of
those
who
are
to
be
judged
leaders
from
the
beginning
of
history
barbarians
with
their
crude
weapons
classic
characters
cæsar
and
his
rivals
for
fame
mediæval
figures
including
dante
meditating
later
figures
richelieu
napoleon
many
people
march
toward
the
strange
glorifying
eye
of
the
camera
growing
larger
than
men
filling
the
entire
field
of
vision
disappearing
when
they
are
almost
upon
us
the
audience
weighs
the
worth
of
their
work
to
the
world
as
the
men
themselves
with
downcast
eyes
seem
to
be
doing
also
the
most
thrilling
figure
is
tolstoi
in
his
peasant
smock
coming
after
the
bitter
egotists
and
conquerors
the
impersonation
is
by
edward
thomas
i
shall
never
forget
that
presence
marching
up
to
the
throne
invisible
with
bowed
head
this
procession
is
to
illustrate
the
line
he
is
sifting
out
the
hearts
of
men
before
his
judgment
seat
later
lincoln
is
pictured
on
the
steps
of
the
white
house
it
is
a
quaint
tableau
in
the
spirit
of
the
rogers
group
yet
it
is
masterful
for
all
that
lincoln
is
taking
the
chains
from
a
cowering
slave
this
tableau
is
to
illustrate
the
line
let
the
hero
born
of
woman
crush
the
serpent
with
his
heel
now
it
is
the
end
of
the
series
of
visions
it
is
morning
in
howe
room
she
rises
she
is
filled
with
wonder
to
find
the
poem
on
her
table
written
to
the
rousing
of
john
brown
body
the
song
goes
over
the
north
like
wildfire
the
home
of
the
widow
is
shown
she
and
the
boy
read
the
famous
chant
in
the
morning
news
column
she
takes
the
old
sword
from
the
wall
she
gives
it
to
her
son
and
sends
him
to
enlist
with
her
blessing
in
the
next
picture
lincoln
and
howe
are
looking
out
of
the
window
where
was
once
the
idle
recruiting
tent
a
new
army
is
pouring
by
singing
the
words
that
have
rallied
the
nation
ritualistic
birth
and
death
have
been
discussed
this
film
might
be
said
to
illustrate
ritualistic
birth
death
and
resurrection
the
writer
has
seen
hundreds
of
productions
since
this
one
he
has
described
it
from
memory
it
came
out
in
a
time
when
the
american
people
paid
no
attention
to
the
producer
or
the
cast
it
may
have
many
technical
crudities
by
standards
but
the
root
of
the
matter
is
there
and
springfield
knew
it
it
was
brought
back
to
our
town
many
times
it
was
popular
in
both
the
fashionable
picture
show
houses
and
the
cheapest
dirtiest
hole
in
the
town
it
will
soon
be
reissued
by
the
vitagraph
company
every
student
of
american
art
should
see
this
film
the
same
exultation
that
went
into
it
the
faculty
for
commanding
the
great
spirits
of
history
and
making
visible
the
unseen
powers
of
the
air
should
be
applied
to
crowd
pictures
which
interpret
the
prayers
of
the
broad
human
race
the
pageant
of
religious
splendor
is
the
final
photoplay
form
in
the
classification
which
this
work
seeks
to
establish
much
of
what
follows
will
be
to
reënforce
the
heads
of
these
first
discourses
further
comment
on
the
religious
photoplay
may
be
found
in
the
eleventh
chapter
entitled
chapter
viii
the
outline
is
complete
now
to
reënforce
it
pictures
of
action
intimacy
and
splendor
are
the
foundation
colors
in
the
photoplay
as
red
blue
and
yellow
are
the
basis
of
the
rainbow
action
films
might
be
called
the
red
section
intimate
motion
pictures
being
colder
and
quieter
might
be
called
blue
and
splendor
photoplays
called
yellow
since
that
is
the
hue
of
pageants
and
sunshine
another
way
of
showing
the
distinction
is
to
review
the
types
of
gesture
the
action
photoplay
deals
with
generalized
pantomime
the
gesture
of
the
conventional
policeman
in
contrast
with
the
mannerism
of
the
stereotyped
preacher
the
intimate
film
gives
us
more
elusive
personal
gestures
the
difference
between
the
table
manners
of
two
preachers
in
the
same
restaurant
or
two
policemen
a
mark
of
the
fairy
play
is
the
gesture
of
incantation
the
sweep
of
the
arm
whereby
mab
would
transform
a
prince
into
a
hawk
the
other
splendor
films
deal
with
the
total
gestures
of
crowds
the
pantomime
of
a
mass
of
men
the
drill
of
an
army
on
the
march
or
the
bending
of
the
heads
of
a
congregation
receiving
the
benediction
another
way
to
demonstrate
the
thesis
is
to
use
the
old
classification
of
poetry
dramatic
lyric
epic
the
action
play
is
a
narrow
form
of
the
dramatic
the
intimate
motion
picture
is
an
equivalent
of
the
lyric
in
the
seventeenth
chapter
it
is
shown
that
one
type
of
the
intimate
might
be
classed
as
imagist
and
obviously
the
splendor
pictures
are
the
equivalent
of
the
epic
but
perhaps
the
most
adequate
way
of
showing
the
meaning
of
this
outline
is
to
say
that
the
action
film
is
the
intimate
photoplay
is
and
the
fairy
pageant
along
with
the
rest
of
the
splendor
pictures
may
be
described
as
this
chapter
will
discuss
the
bearing
of
the
phrase
it
will
relate
directly
to
chapter
two
first
gentle
and
kindly
reader
let
us
discuss
sculpture
in
its
most
literal
sense
after
that
less
realistically
but
perhaps
more
adequately
let
us
begin
with
annette
kellerman
in
neptune
daughter
this
film
has
a
crude
plot
constructed
to
show
off
annette
various
athletic
resources
it
is
good
photography
and
a
big
idea
so
far
as
the
swimming
episodes
are
concerned
an
artist
haunted
by
equivalent
to
the
musical
thoughts
back
of
wagner
could
have
made
of
annette
in
her
mermaid
dress
a
notable
figure
or
a
story
akin
to
the
mermaid
tale
of
hans
christian
andersen
or
matthew
arnold
poem
of
the
forsaken
merman
could
have
made
this
picturesque
witch
of
the
salt
water
truly
significant
and
still
retained
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
the
photoplay
as
it
was
exhibited
it
is
an
exceedingly
irrelevant
imagination
that
shows
her
in
other
scenes
as
a
duellist
for
instance
because
forsooth
she
can
fence
as
a
child
of
the
ocean
half
fish
half
woman
she
is
indeed
convincing
such
mermaids
as
this
have
haunted
sailors
and
lured
them
on
the
rocks
to
their
doom
from
the
day
the
siren
sang
till
the
hour
the
lorelei
sang
no
more
the
scene
with
the
baby
mermaid
when
she
swims
with
the
pretty
creature
on
her
back
is
irresistible
why
are
our
managers
so
mechanical
why
do
they
flatten
out
at
the
moment
the
fancy
of
the
tiniest
reader
of
begins
to
be
alive
most
of
annette
support
were
stage
dummies
neptune
was
a
lame
santa
claus
with
cotton
whiskers
but
as
for
the
bearing
of
the
film
on
this
chapter
the
human
figure
is
within
its
rights
whenever
it
is
as
free
from
as
was
the
annette
in
the
heavenly
clear
waters
of
bermuda
on
the
other
hand
neptune
and
his
pasteboard
diadem
and
pitchfork
should
have
put
on
his
and
retired
as
a
toe
dancer
in
an
alleged
court
scene
on
land
annette
was
a
mere
simperer
possibly
pavlowa
as
a
swimmer
in
bermuda
waters
would
have
been
as
much
of
a
mistake
each
queen
to
her
kingdom
for
living
moving
sculpture
the
human
eye
requires
a
costume
and
a
part
in
unity
with
the
meaning
of
that
particular
figure
there
is
the
greek
dress
of
mordkin
in
the
arrow
dance
there
is
annette
breast
covering
of
shells
and
wonderful
flowing
mermaid
hair
clothing
her
as
the
midnight
does
the
moon
the
new
costume
freedom
of
the
photoplay
allows
such
limitation
of
clothing
as
would
be
probable
when
one
is
honestly
in
touch
with
wild
nature
and
preoccupied
with
vigorous
exercise
thus
the
and
desert
island
narratives
though
seldom
well
done
when
produced
with
verisimilitude
give
an
opportunity
for
the
native
human
frame
in
the
logical
wrappings
of
reeds
and
skins
but
those
who
in
a
silly
hurry
seek
excuses
are
generally
merely
ridiculous
like
the
barefoot
man
who
is
terribly
tender
about
walking
on
the
pebbles
or
the
wild
man
who
is
white
as
celery
or
grass
under
a
board
there
is
no
short
cut
to
vitality
a
successful
literal
use
of
sculpture
is
in
the
film
oil
and
water
blanche
sweet
is
the
leader
of
the
play
within
a
play
which
occupies
the
first
reel
here
the
olympians
and
the
muses
with
a
grace
that
we
fancy
was
greek
lead
a
dance
that
traces
the
story
of
the
spring
summer
and
autumn
of
life
finally
the
supple
dancers
turn
gray
and
old
and
die
but
not
before
they
have
given
us
a
vision
from
the
ionian
islands
the
play
might
have
been
inspired
from
reading
keats
lamia
but
is
probably
derived
from
the
work
of
isadora
duncan
this
chapter
has
hereafter
only
a
passing
word
or
two
on
literal
sculptural
effects
it
has
more
in
mind
the
carver
attitude
toward
all
that
passes
before
the
eye
the
sculptor
george
gray
barnard
is
responsible
for
none
of
the
views
in
this
discourse
but
he
has
talked
to
me
at
length
about
his
sense
of
discovery
in
watching
the
most
ordinary
motion
pictures
and
his
delight
in
following
them
with
their
endless
combinations
of
masses
and
flowing
surfaces
the
little
people
on
the
speaking
stage
do
not
appeal
to
the
plastic
sense
in
this
way
they
are
by
comparison
mere
bits
of
pasteboard
with
sweet
voices
while
on
the
other
hand
the
photoplay
foreground
is
full
of
dumb
giants
the
bodies
of
these
giants
are
in
high
sculptural
relief
where
the
lights
are
quite
glaring
and
the
photography
is
bad
many
of
the
figures
are
as
hard
in
their
impact
on
the
eye
as
no
matter
what
the
clothing
there
are
several
passages
of
this
sort
in
the
otherwise
beautiful
enoch
arden
where
the
shipwrecked
sailor
is
depicted
on
his
desert
island
in
the
glaring
sun
what
materials
should
the
photoplay
figures
suggest
there
are
as
many
possible
materials
as
there
are
subjects
for
pictures
and
tone
schemes
to
be
considered
but
we
will
take
for
illustration
wood
bronze
and
marble
since
they
have
been
used
in
the
old
sculptural
art
there
is
found
in
most
art
shows
a
type
of
carved
wood
gargoyle
where
the
work
and
the
subject
are
at
one
not
only
in
the
color
of
the
wood
but
in
the
way
the
material
masses
itself
in
bulk
betrays
its
qualities
we
will
suppose
a
moving
picture
humorist
who
is
in
the
same
mood
as
the
carver
he
chooses
a
story
of
quaint
old
ladies
street
gamins
and
fat
aldermen
imagine
the
figures
with
the
same
massing
and
interplay
suddenly
invested
with
life
yet
giving
to
the
eye
a
pleasure
kindred
to
that
which
is
found
in
carved
wood
and
bringing
to
the
fancy
a
similar
humor
or
there
is
a
type
of
action
story
where
the
mood
of
the
figures
is
that
of
bronze
with
the
æsthetic
resources
of
that
metal
its
elasticity
its
emphasis
on
the
tendon
ligament
and
bone
rather
than
on
the
muscle
and
an
attribute
that
we
will
call
the
quality
hermon
macneil
has
a
memorable
piece
of
work
in
the
yard
of
the
architect
shaw
at
lake
forest
illinois
it
is
called
the
sun
vow
a
little
indian
is
shooting
toward
the
sun
while
the
old
warrior
crouching
immediately
behind
him
follows
with
his
eye
the
direction
of
the
arrow
few
pieces
of
sculpture
come
readily
to
mind
that
show
more
happily
the
qualities
of
bronze
as
distinguished
from
other
materials
to
imagine
such
a
group
done
in
marble
carved
wood
or
della
robbia
ware
is
to
destroy
the
very
image
in
the
fancy
the
photoplay
of
the
american
indian
should
in
most
instances
be
planned
as
bronze
in
action
the
tribes
should
not
move
so
rapidly
that
the
elasticity
is
lost
in
the
riding
running
and
scalping
on
the
other
hand
the
aborigines
should
be
far
from
the
temperateness
of
marble

i
have
gone
through
my
old
territories
as
an
art
student
in
the
chicago
art
institute
and
the
metropolitan
museum
of
late
in
special
excursions
looking
for
sculpture
painting
and
architecture
that
might
be
the
basis
for
the
photoplays
of
the
future
the

frederick
macmonnies
is
in
bronze
in
the
metropolitan
museum
and
in
bronze
replica
in
the
boston
museum
of
fine
arts
there
is
probably
no
work
that
more
rejoices
the
hearts
of
the
young
art
students
in
either
city
the
youthful
creature
illustrates
a
most
joyous
leap
into
the
air
she
is
high
on
one
foot
with
the
other
knee
lifted
she
holds
a
bunch
of
grapes

her
baby
clutched
in
the

light
this
is
as
the
sun
vow
is
this
special
story
could
not
be
told
in
another
medium
i
have
seen
in
paris
a
marble
copy
of
this
bacchante
it
is
as
though
it
were
done
in
soap
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
renaissance
italian
sculptors
have
given
us
children
in
marble
in
low
relief
dancing
like
lilies
in
the
wind
they
could
not
be
put
into
bronze
the
plot
of
the
action
photoplay
is
literally
or
metaphorically
a
chase
down
the
road
or
a
it
might
be
well
to
consider
how
typical
figures
for
such
have
been
put
into
carved
material
there
are
two
bronze
statues
that
have
their
replicas
in
all
museums
they
are
generally
one
on
either
side
of
the
main
hall
towering
above
the
balustrade
first
the
statue
of
gattamelata
a
venetian
general
by
donatello
the
original
is
in
padua
then
there
is
the
figure
of
bartolommeo
colleoni
the
original
is
in
venice
it
is
by
verrocchio
and
leopardi
these
equestrians
radiate
authority
there
is
more
action
in
them
than
in
any
cowboy
hordes
i
have
ever
beheld
zipping
across
the
screen
look
upon
them
and
ponder
long
prospective
even
in
a
simple
the
speed
must
not
destroy
the
chance
to
enjoy
the
modelling
if
you
would
give
us
mounted
legions
destined
to
conquer
let
any
one
section
of
the
film
if
it
is
stopped
and
studied
be
grounded
in
the
same
bronze
conception
the
assyrian
commanders
in
griffith
judith
would
without
great
embarrassment
stand
this
test
but
it
may
not
be
the
pursuit
of
an
enemy
we
have
in
mind
it
may
be
a
spring
celebration
horsemen
in
arcadia
going
to
some
happy
tournament
where
will
we
find
our
precedents
for
such
a
cavalcade
go
to
any
museum
find
the
parthenon
room
high
on
the
wall
is
the
copy
of
the
famous
marble
frieze
of
the
young
citizens
who
are
in
the
procession
in
praise
of
athena
such
a
rhythm
of
bodies
and
heads
and
the
feet
of
proud
steeds
and
above
all
the
profiles
of
thoroughbred
youths
no
city
has
seen
since
that
day
the
delicate
composition
relations
ever
varying
ever
refreshing
amid
the
seeming
sameness
of
formula
of
rider
behind

have
been
the
delight
of
art
students
the
world
over
and
shall
so
remain
no
serious
observer
escapes
the
exhilaration
of
this
company
let
it
be
studied
by
the

buy
any
three
moving

magazines
you
please
mark
the
illustrations
that
are
massive
in
high
relief
with
long
lines
in
their
edges
cut
out
and
sort
some
of
these
i
have
done
it
on
the
table
where
i
write
after
throwing
away
all
but
the
best
specimens
i
have
four
different
kinds
of
sculpture
first
behold
the
inevitable
cowboy
he
is
on
a
ramping
horse
filling
the
entire
outlook
the
steed
rears
while
facing
us
the
cowboy
waves
his
hat
there
is
quite
such
an
animal
by
frederick
macmonnies
wrought
in
bronze
set
up
on
a
gate
to
a
park
in
brooklyn
it
is
not
the
identical
color
of
the
photoplay
animal
but
the
bronze
elasticity
is
the
joy
in
both
here
is
a
scene
of
a
masked
monk
carrying
off
a
fainting
girl
the
hero
intercepts
him
the
figures
of
the
lady
and
the
monk
are
in
sufficient
sculptural
harmony
to
make
a
formal
sculptural
group
for
an
art
exhibition
the
picture
of
the
hero
strong
with
surfaces
is
related
to
both
the
fact
that
he
is
in
evening
dress
does
not
alter
his
monumental
quality
all
three
are
on
a
stone
balcony
that
relates
itself
to
the
general
largeness
of
spirit
in
the
group
and
the
dress
of
the
maiden
no
doubt
the
title
is
the
morning
following
the
masquerade
ball
this
group
could
be
made
in
unglazed
clay
in
four
colors
here
is
an
american
lieutenant
with
two
ladies
the
three
are
suddenly
alert
over
the
approach
of
the
villain
who
is
not
yet
in
the
picture
in
costume
it
is
an
everyday
group
but
those
three
figures
are
related
to
one
another
and
the
trees
behind
them
in
simple
sculptural
terms
the
lieutenant
as
is
to
be
expected
looks
forth
in
fierce
readiness
one
girl
stands
with
clasped
hands
the
other
points
to
the
danger
the
relations
of
these
people
to
one
another
may
seem
merely
dramatic
to
the
superficial
observer
but
the
power
of
the
group
is
in
the
fact
that
it
is
monumental
i
could
imagine
it
done
in
four
different
kinds
of
rare
tropical
wood
carved
unpolished
here
is
a
scene
of
storm
and
stress
in
an
office
where
the
hero
is
caught
with
seemingly
incriminating
papers
the
table
is
in
confusion
the
room
is
filling
with
people
led
by
one
accusing
woman
is
this
also
sculpture
yes
the
figures
are
in
high
relief
even
the
surfaces
of
the
chairs
and
the
littered
table
are
massive
and
the
eye
travels
without
weariness
as
it
should
do
in
sculpture
from
the
hero
to
the
furious
woman
then
to
the
attorney
behind
her
then
to
the
two
other
revilers
then
to
the
crowd
in
three
loose
rhythmic
ranks
the
eye
makes
this
journey
not
from
space
to
space
or
fabric
to
fabric
but
first
of
all
from
mass
to
mass
it
is
sculpture
but
it
is
the
sort
that
can
be
done
in
no
medium
but
the
moving
picture
itself
and
therefore
it
is
one
goal
of
this
argument
but
there
are
several
other
goals
one
of
the
sculpturesque
resources
of
the
photoplay
is
that
the
human
countenance
can
be
magnified
many
times
till
it
fills
the
entire
screen
some
examples
are
in
rather
low
relief
portraits
approximating
certain
painters
but
if
they
are
on
sculptural
terms
and
are
studies
of
the
faces
of
thinking
men
let
the
producer
make
a
pilgrimage
to
washington
for
his
precedent
there
in
the
rotunda
of
the
capitol
is
the
face
of
lincoln
by
gutzon
borglum
it
is
one
of
the
eminently
successful
attempts
to
get
at
the
secret
of
the
countenance
by
enlarging
it
much
and
concentrating
the
whole
consideration
there
the
photoplay
producer
seemingly
without
taking
thought
is
apt
to
show
a
sculptural
sense
in
giving
us
newfoundland
fishermen
clad
in
oilskins
the
background
may
have
an
unconscious
winslow
homer
reminiscence
in
the
foreground
our
hardy
heroes
fill
the
screen
and
dripping
with
become
granite
yet
living
creatures
none
the
less
imagine
some
one
chapter
from
the
story
of
little
in
david
copperfield
retold
in
the
films
show
us
ham
peggotty
and
old
peggotty
in
colloquy
over
their
nets
there
are
many
powerful
bronze
groups
to
be
had
from
these
two
on
to
the
heroic
and
unselfish
death
of
ham
rescuing
his
enemy
in
storm
and
lightning
i
have
seen
one
rich
picture
of
alleged
cannibal
tribes
it
was
a
comedy
about
a
missionary
but
the
aborigines
were
like
living
ebony
and
silver
that
was
long
ago
such
things
come
too
much
by
accident
the
producer
is
not
sufficiently
aware
that
any
artistic
element
in
his
list
of
productions
that
is
allowed
to
go
wild
that
has
not
had
full
analysis
reanalysis
and
final
conservation
wastes
his
chance
to
attain
supreme
mastery
open
your
history
of
sculpture
and
dwell
upon
those
illustrations
which
are
not
the
normal
reposeful
statues
but
the
exceptional
such
as
have
been
listed
for
this
chapter
imagine
that
each
dancing
galloping
or
fighting
figure
comes
down
into
the
room
watch
it
against
a
dark
curtain
let
it
go
through
a
series
of
gestures
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
original
conception
and
as
rapidly
as
possible
not
to
lose
nobility
if
you
have
the
necessary
elasticity
imagine
the
figures
wearing
the
costumes
of
another
period
yet
retaining
in
their
motions
the
same
essential
spirit
combine
them
in
your
mind
with
one
or
two
kindred
figures
enlarged
till
they
fill
the
end
of
the
room
you
have
now
created
the
beginning
of
an
action
photoplay
in
your
own
fancy
do
this
with
each
most
energetic
classic
till
your
imagination
flags
i
do
not
want
to
be
too
dogmatic
but
it
seems
to
me
this
is
one
way
to
evolve
real
action
plays
it
would
perhaps
be
well
to
substitute
this
for
the
usual
method
of
evolving
them
from
old
stage
material
or
newspaper
clippings
there
is
in
the
metropolitan
museum
a
noble
modern
group
the
mares
of
diomedes
by
the
aforementioned
gutzon
borglum
it
is
full
of
material
for
the
meditations
of
a
man
who
wants
to
make
a
film
of
a
stampede
the
idea
is
that
hercules
riding
his
steed
bareback
guides
it
in
a
circle
he
is
fascinating
the
horses
he
has
been
told
to
capture
they
are
held
by
the
mesmerism
of
the
circular
path
and
follow
him
round
and
round
till
they
finally
fall
from
exhaustion
thus
the
indians
of
the
west
capture
wild
ponies
and
borglum
a
far
western
man
imputes
the
method
to
hercules
the
bronze
group
shows
a
segment
of
this
circle
the
whirlwind
is
at
its
height
the
mares
are
wild
to
taste
the
flesh
of
hercules
whoever
is
to
photograph
horses
let
him
study
the
play
of
light
and
color
and
in
this
bronze
and
let
no
group
of
horses
ever
run
faster
than
these
of
borglum
an
occasional
hint
of
a
michelangelo
figure
or
gesture
appears
for
a
flash
in
the
films
young
artist
in
the
audience
does
it
pass
you
by
open
your
history
of
sculpture
again
and
look
at
the
usual
list
of
michelangelo
groups
suppose
the
seated
majesty
of
moses
should
rise
what
would
be
the
quality
of
the
action
suppose
the
sleeping
figures
of
the
medician
tombs
should
wake
or
those
famous
slaves
should
break
their
bands
or
david
again
hurl
the
stone
would
not
their
action
be
as
heroic
as
their
quietness
is
it
not
possible
to
have
a
michelangelo
of
photoplay
sculpture
should
we
not
look
for
him
in
the
fulness
of
time
his
figures
might
come
to
us
in
the
skins
of
the
desert
island
solitary
or
as
cave
men
and
women
or
as
mermaids
and
mermen
and
yet
have
a
force
and
grandeur
akin
to
that
of
the
old
italian
rodin
famous
group
of
the
citizens
of
calais
is
an
example
of
the
expression
of
one
particular
idea
by
a
special
technical
treatment
the
producer
who
tells
a
kindred
story
to
that
of
the
siege
of
calais
and
the
final
going
of
these
humble
men
to
their
doom
will
have
a
indeed
it
will
be
not
only
but
a
great
crowd
picture
it
begins
to
be
seen
that
the
possibilities
of
monumental
achievement
in
the
films
transcend
the
narrow
boundaries
of
the
action
photoplay
why
not
conceptions
as
heroic
as
rodin
hand
of
god
where
the
first
pair
are
clasped
in
the
gigantic
fingers
of
their
maker
in
the
clay
from
which
they
came
finally
i
desire
in
moving
pictures
not
the
stillness
but
the
majesty
of
sculpture
i
do
not
advocate
for
the
photoplay
the
mood
of
the
venus
of
milo
but
let
us
turn
to
that
sister
of
hers
the
great
victory
of
samothrace
that
spreads
her
wings
at
the
head
of
the
steps
of
the
louvre
and
in
many
an
art
gallery
beside
when
you
are
appraising
a
new
film
ask
yourself
is
this
motion
as
rapid
as
godlike
as
the
sweep
of
the
wings
of
the
samothracian
let
her
be
the
touchstone
of
the
action
drama
for
nothing
can
be
more
swift
than
the
winged
gods
nothing
can
be
more
powerful
than
the
oncoming
of
the
immortals
chapter
ix
this
chapter
is
founded
on
the
delicate
effects
that
may
be
worked
out
from
cosy
interior
scenes
close
to
the
camera
it
relates
directly
to
chapter
three
while
the
motion
picture
may
be
in
high
sculptural
relief
its
characteristic
manifestations
are
in
low
relief
the
situations
show
to
better
advantage
when
they
seem
to
be
paintings
rather
than
monumental
groups
turn
to
your
handful
of
motion
picture
magazines
and
mark
the
illustrations
that
look
the
most
like
paintings
cut
them
out
winnow
them
several
times
i
have
before
me
as
a
final
threshing
from
such
an
experiment
five
pictures
each
one
approximates
a
different
school
here
is
a
colonial
virginia
maiden
by
the
hearth
of
the
inn
bending
over
her
in
a
cherishing
way
is
the
negro
maid
on
the
other
side
the
innkeeper
shows
a
kindred
solicitude
a
dishevelled
traveller
sleeps
huddled
up
in
the
corner
the
costume
of
the
man
fades
into
the
velvety
shadows
of
the
wall
his
face
is
concealed
his
hair
blends
with
the
soft
background
the
clothing
of
the
other
three
makes
a
patch
of
light
gray
added
to
this
is
the
gayety
of
special
textures
the
turban
of
the
negress
a
trimming
on
the
skirt
of
the
heroine
the
silkiness
of
the
innkeeper
locks
the
fabric
of
the
broom
in
the
hearthlight
the
pattern
of
the
mortar
lines
round
the
bricks
of
the
hearth
the
tableau
is
a
satisfying
scheme
in
two
planes
and
many
textures
here
is
another
sort
of
painting
the
young
mother
in
her
pretty
bed
is
smiling
on
her
infant
the
cot
and
covers
and
flesh
tints
have
gentle
scales
of
difference
all
within
one
tone
of
the
softest
gray
her
hair
is
quite
dark
it
relates
to
the
less
luminous
black
of
the
coat
of
the
physician
behind
the
bed
and
the
dress
of
the
bending
over
her
the
nurse
standing
by
the
doctor
is
a
figure
of
the
same
as
the
bed
within
the
pattern
of
the
there
are
as
many
subtle
gradations
as
in
the
pattern
of
the
the
tableau
is
a
satisfying
scheme
in
black
and
gray
with
practically
one
texture
throughout
here
is
a
picture
of
an
englishman
and
his
wife
in
india
it
might
be
called
sculptural
but
for
the
magnificence
of
the
turban
of
the
rajah
who
converses
with
them
the
glitter
of
the
light
round
his
shoulders
and
the
scheme
of
shadow
out
of
which
the
three
figures
rise
the
arrangement
remotely
reminds
one
of
several
of
rembrandt
musings
here
is
a
picture
of
mary
pickford
as
fanchon
the
cricket
she
is
in
the
cottage
with
the
strange
old
mother
i
have
seen
a
painting
in
this
mood
by
the
greek
nickolas
gysis
the
moving
picture
the
photoplay
of
need
not
be
indoors
as
long
as
it
has
the
mood
it
is
generally
keyed
to
the
hearthstone
and
keeps
quite
close
to
it
but
how
well
i
remember
when
the
first
french
photoplays
began
to
come
though
unintelligent
in
some
respects
the
photography
and
of
many
of
them
made
one
think
of
that
painter
of
gentle
scenes
jean
charles
cazin
here
is
our
last
clipping
which
is
also
in
a
spirit
allied
to
cazin
the
heroine
accompanied
by
an
aged
shepherd
and
his
dog
are
in
the
foreground
the
sheep
are
in
the
middle
distance
on
the
edge
of
the
river
there
is
a
noble
hill
beyond
the
gently
flowing
water
here
is
intimacy
and
friendliness
in
the
midst
of
the
big
out
of
doors
if
these
five
were
on
good
paper
enlarged
to
twenty
by
inches
they
would
do
to
frame
and
hang
on
the
wall
of
any
study
for
a
month
or
so
and
after
the
relentless
test
of
time
i
would
venture
that
some
one
of
the
five
would
prove
a
permanent
addition
to
the
household
gods
hastily
made
photographs
selected
from
the
films
are
often
put
in
front
of
the
better
theatres
to
advertise
the
show
of
late
they
are
making
them
two
by
three
feet
and
sometimes
several
times
larger
here
is
a
commercial
beginning
of
an
art
gallery
but
not
enough
pains
are
taken
to
give
the
selections
a
complete
art
gallery
dignity
why
not
have
the
most
beautiful
scenes
in
front
of
the
theatres
instead
of
those
alleged
to
be
the
most
thrilling
why
not
rest
the
fevered
and
wandering
eye
rather
than
make
one
more
attempt
to
take
it
by
force
let
the
reader
supply
another
side
of
the
argument
by
looking
at
the
illustrations
in
any
history
of
painting
let
him
select
the
pictures
that
charm
him
most
and
think
of
them
enlarged
and
transferred
bodily
to
one
corner
of
the
room
as
he
has
thought
of
the
sculpture
let
them
take
on
motion
without
losing
their
charm
of
low
relief
or
their
serene
composition
within
the
four
walls
of
the
frame
as
for
the
motion
let
it
be
a
further
extension
of
the
drawing
let
every
gesture
be
a
bolder
but
not
less
graceful
the
metropolitan
museum
has
a
van
dyck
that
appeals
equally
to
one
sense
of
beauty
and
one
feeling
for
humor
it
is
a
portrait
of
james
stuart
duke
of
lennox
and
i
can
not
see
how
the
can
look
upon
it
without
having
it
set
his
imagination
in
a
glow
every
small
town
dancing
set
has
a
james
like
this
the
man
and
the
greyhound
are
the
same
witless
breed
the
kind
that
achieve
a
result
by
their
elegance
alone
van
dyck
has
painted
the
two
with
what
might
be
called
a
greyhound
a
style
of
handling
that
is
nothing
but
courtly
convention
and
strut
to
the
point
of
genius
he
is
as
far
from
the
meditative
spirituality
of
rembrandt
as
could
well
be
imagined
conjure
up
a
scene
in
the
hereditary
hall
after
a
hunt
or
golf
tournament
in
which
a
man
like
this
duke
of
lennox
has
a
noble
parley
with
his
lady
or
dancing
partner
she
being
a
sweet
and
stupid
swan
or
a
white
rabbit
by
the
same
sign
that
he
is
a
noble
and
stupid
greyhound
be
it
an
ancient
or
modern
episode
the
story
could
be
told
in
the
tone
and
with
the
brushwork
of
van
dyck
then
there
is
a
picture
my
teachers
chase
and
henri
were
never
weary
of
praising
the
girl
with
the
parrot
by
manet
here
continence
in
nervous
force
expressed
by
low
relief
and
restraint
in
tone
is
carried
to
its
ultimate
point
i
should
call
this
an
imagist
painting
made
before
there
were
such
people
as
imagist
poets
it
is
a
perpetual
sermon
to
those
that
would
thresh
around
to
no
avail
be
they
orators
melodramatists
or
makers
of
photoplays
with
an
alleged
let
us
consider
gilbert
stuart
portrait
of
washington
this
notion
of
personal
dignity
has
far
more
of
the
intellectual
quality
than
van
dyck
he
loves
to
give
us
stately
able
fairly
conscientious
gentry
rather
than
overdone
royalty
his
work
represents
a
certain
mood
in
design
that
in
architecture
is
called
colonial
such
portraits
go
with
houses
like
mount
vernon
let
the
photographer
study
the
flat
blacks
in
the
garments
let
him
note
the
transparent
impression
of
the
laces
and
that
seem
to
be
painted
on
glass
observing
especially
the
crystalline
whiteness
of
the
wigs
let
him
inspect
also
the
outlines
noting
the
courtly
they
convey
then
let
the
photographer
the
producer
and
the
author
be
they
one
man
or
six
men
stick
to
this
type
of
picturization
through
one
entire
production
till
any
artist
in
the
audience
will
say
this
photoplay
was
painted
by
a
pupil
of
gilbert
stuart
and
the
layman
will
say
it
looks
like
those
stately
days
and
let
us
not
have
battle
but
a
mount
vernon
fireside
tale
both
the
chicago
and
new
york
museums
contain
many
phases
of
one
same
family
group
painted
by
george
de
forest
brush
there
is
a
touch
of
the
hearthstone
priestess
about
the
woman
the
force
of
sex
has
turned
to
the
austere
comforting
passion
of
motherhood
from
the
children
under
the
wings
of
this
spirit
come
special
delicate
powers
of
life
there
is
nothing
tense
or
restless
about
them
yet
they
embody
action
the
beating
of
the
inner
fire
without
which
all
outer
action
is
mockery
hearthstone
tales
keyed
to
the
mood
and
using
the
brush
stroke
that
delineates
this
especial
circle
would
be
unmistakable
in
their
distinction
charles
hawthorne
has
pictures
in
chicago
and
new
york
that
imply
the
photoplay
the
trousseau
in
the
metropolitan
museum
shows
a
gentle
girl
an
unfashionable
with
a
sweetly
sheltered
air
behind
her
glimmers
the
patient
mother
face
the
older
woman
is
busy
about
fitting
the
dress
the
picture
is
a
tribute
to
the
qualities
of
many
unknown
gentlewomen
such
an
illumination
as
this
on
faces
so
innocently
eloquent
is
the
light
that
should
shine
on
the
countenance
of
the
photoplay
actress
who
really
desires
greatness
in
the
field
of
the
intimate
motion
picture
there
is
in
chicago
hawthorne
painting
of
sylvia
a
little
girl
standing
with
her
back
to
a
mirror
a
few
blossoms
in
one
hand
and
a
vase
of
flowers
on
the
mirror
shelf
it
is
as
sound
a
composition
as
hawthorne
ever
produced
the
painting
of
the
child
is
another
tribute
to
the
textures
from
which
humanity
is
made
ah
you
producer
who
have
grown
squeaky
whipping
your
people
into
what
you
called
action
consider
the
dynamics
of
these
figures
that
would
be
almost
motionless
in
real
life
remember
there
must
be
a
under
the
other
or
all
is
dead
yet
that
soul
may
be
the
muse
of
comedy
if
hawthorne
and
his
kind
are
not
your
fashion
turn
to
models
that
have
their
feet
on
the
earth
always
yet
successfully
aspire
key
some
of
your
intimate
humorous
scenes
to
the
dutch
little
masters
of
painting
such
pictures
as
gerard
terburg
music
lesson
in
the
chicago
art
institute
the
thing
is
as
well
designed
as
a
dutch
house
or
clock
and
it
is
more
elegant
than
any
of
these
there
is
humor
enough
in
the
picture
to
last
one
reel
through
the
society
dame
of
the
period
in
her
pretty
raiment
fingers
the
strings
of
her
musical
instrument
while
the
master
stands
by
her
with
the
baton
the
painter
has
enjoyed
the
satire
from
her
elegant
little
hands
to
the
teacher
locks
it
is
very
plain
that
she
does
not
want
to
study
music
with
any
sincerity
and
he
does
not
desire
to
develop
the
ability
of
this
particular
person
there
may
be
a
flirtation
in
the
background
yet
these
people
are
not
hollow
as
gourds
and
they
are
not
caricatured
the
dutch
little
masters
have
indulged
in
numberless
characterizations
of
mundane
humanity
but
they
are
never
so
preoccupied
with
the
story
that
it
is
an
anecdote
rather
than
a
picture
it
is
first
of
all
a
piece
of
elegant
next
it
is
a
scrap
of
dutch
philosophy
or
aspiration
let
whistler
turn
over
in
his
grave
while
we
enlist
him
for
the
cause
of
democracy
one
view
of
the
technique
of
this
man
might
summarize
it
thus
fastidiousness
in
choice
of
subject
the
picture
well
within
the
frame
low
relief
a
velasquez
study
of
tones
and
a
japanese
study
of
spaces
let
us
dear
and
patient
reader
particularly
dwell
upon
the
spacing
a
whistler
or
a
good
japanese
print
might
be
described
as
a
kaleidoscope
suddenly
arrested
and
transfixed
at
the
moment
of
most
exquisite
relations
in
the
pieces
of
glass
an
intimate
play
of
a
kindred
sort
would
start
to
turning
the
kaleidoscope
again
losing
fine
relations
only
to
gain
those
which
are
more
exquisite
and
novel
all
motion
pictures
might
be
characterized
as
measured
without
sound
plus
time
measured
without
this
description
fits
in
a
special
way
the
delicate
form
of
the
intimate
motion
picture
and
there
can
be
studied
out
free
from
irrelevant
issues
as
to
measured
without
suppose
it
is
a
humorous
characterization
of
comfortable
family
life
founded
on
some
dutch
little
master
the
picture
measures
off
its
spaces
in
harmony
the
triangle
occupied
by
the
little
child
dress
is
in
definite
relation
to
the
triangle
occupied
by
the
mother
costume
to
these
two
patterns
the
space
measured
off
by
the
boy
figure
is
adjusted
and
all
of
them
are
as
carefully
related
to
the
shapes
cut
out
of
the
background
by
the
figures
no
matter
how
the
characters
move
about
in
the
photoplay
these
pattern
shapes
should
relate
to
one
another
in
a
definite
design
the
exact
tone
value
of
each
one
and
their
precise
nearness
or
distance
to
one
another
have
a
deal
to
do
with
the
final
effect
we
go
to
the
photoplay
to
enjoy
right
and
splendid
to
feel
a
certain
thrill
when
the
pieces
of
kaleidoscope
glass
slide
into
new
places
instead
of
moving
on
straight
lines
as
they
do
in
the
mechanical
toy
they
progress
in
strange
curves
that
are
part
of
the
very
shapes
into
which
they
fall
consider
first
came
the
photograph
then
motion
was
added
to
the
photograph
we
must
use
this
order
in
our
judgment
if
it
is
ever
to
evolve
into
a
national
art
it
must
first
be
good
picture
then
good
motion
belasco
attitude
toward
the
stage
has
been
denounced
by
the
purists
because
he
makes
settings
too
large
a
portion
of
his
and
transforms
his
theatre
into
the
paradise
of
the
but
this
very
quality
of
the
well
spaced
setting
if
you
please
has
made
his
chance
for
the
world
moving
picture
anthology
as
reproduced
by
jesse
lasky
the
belasco
production
is
the
only
type
of
the
drama
that
seems
really
made
to
be
the
basis
of
a
moving
picture
play
not
always
but
as
a
general
rule
belasco
suffers
less
detriment
in
the
films
than
other
men
take
for
instance
the
production
of
the
rose
of
the
rancho
with
bessie
barriscale
as
the
heroine
it
has
many
highly
modelled
and
others
that
come
under
the
classification
of
this
chapter
when
i
was
attending
it
not
long
ago
here
in
my
home
town
the
fair
companion
at
my
side
said
that
one
scene
looked
like
a
painting
by
sorolla
y
bastida
the
spaniard
it
is
the
episode
where
the
rose
sends
back
her
servant
to
inquire
the
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
sorollas
and
zuloagas
all
through
the
piece
the
betrothal
reception
with
flying
confetti
was
a
satisfying
piece
of
spanish
splendor
it
was
space
music
indeed
space
measured
without
sound
incidentally
the
cast
is
to
be
congratulated
on
its
picturesque
acting
especially
miss
barriscale
in
her
impersonation
of
the
rose
it
is
harder
to
grasp
the
other
side
of
the
paradox
considered
as
measured
without
but
think
of
a
lively
and
humoresque
clock
that
does
not
tick
and
takes
only
an
hour
to
record
a
day
think
of
a
noiseless
electric
vehicle
where
you
are
looking
out
of
the
windows
going
down
the
smooth
boulevard
of
wonderland
consider
a
film
with
three
simple
that
of
the
pursuer
the
pursued
the
observation
vehicle
of
the
camera
following
the
road
and
watching
both
of
them
now
faster
now
slower
than
they
as
the
photographer
overtakes
the
actors
or
allows
them
to
hurry
ahead
the
plain
chase
is
a
bore
because
there
are
only
these
three
but
the
chase
principle
survives
in
every
motion
picture
and
we
simply
need
more
of
this
sort
of
time
measurement
better
considered
the
more
the
objects
the
human
actors
and
the
observer
move
at
a
varying
pace
the
greater
chances
there
are
for
what
might
be
called
music
no
two
people
in
the
same
room
should
gesture
at
one
mechanical
rate
or
lift
their
forks
or
spoons
keeping
obviously
together
yet
it
stands
to
reason
that
each
successive
tableau
should
be
not
only
a
charming
picture
but
the
totals
of
motion
should
be
an
orchestration
of
various
speeds
of
abrupt
graceful
and
seemingly
awkward
progress
worked
into
a
silent
symphony
supposing
it
is
a
romance
in
the
background
the
waves
toss
in
one
tempo
owing
to
the
sail
the
boat
rocks
in
another
in
the
foreground
the
tree
alternately
bends
and
recovers
itself
in
the
breeze
making
more
opposition
than
the
sail
in
still
another
the
smoke
rolls
from
the
chimney
making
no
resistance
to
the
wind
in
another
unit
the
lovers
pace
the
sand
yet
there
is
one
least
common
multiple
in
which
all
move
this
the
producing
genius
should
sense
and
make
part
of
the
dramatic
structure
and
it
would
have
its
bearing
on
the
periodic
appearance
of
the
minor
and
major
crises
films
like
this
you
say
would
be
hard
to
make
yes
here
is
the
place
to
affirm
that
the
intimate
photoplay
will
no
doubt
be
the
form
in
which
this
type
of
music
is
developed
the
music
of
silent
motion
is
the
most
abstract
of
moving
picture
attributes
and
will
probably
remain
the
least
comprehended
like
the
quality
of
walter
pater
marius
the
epicurean
or
that
of
shelley
hymn
to
intellectual
beauty
it
will
not
satisfy
the
sudden
and
the
brash
the
reader
will
find
in
his
round
of
the
picture
theatres
many
single
scenes
and
parts
of
plays
that
elucidate
the
title
of
this
chapter
often
the
first
of
the
story
will
fit
it
well
then
the
producers
finding
that
for
reasons
they
do
not
understand
with
the
best
and
most
earnest
actors
they
can
not
work
the
three
reels
into
an
emotional
climax
introduce
some
stupid
disaster
and
rescue
utterly
irrelevant
to
the
and
the
paintings
that
have
preceded
whether
the
alleged
thesis
be
love
hate
or
ambition
cottage
charm
daisy
dell
sweetness
or
the
ivy
beauty
of
an
ancient
estate
the
resource
for
the
final
punch
seems
to
be
something
like
a
but
the
transfiguration
of
the
actors
not
their
destruction
or
rescue
is
the
goal
the
last
moment
of
the
play
is
great
not
when
it
is
a
grandiose
salvation
from
a
burning
house
that
knocks
every
delicate
preceding
idea
in
the
head
but
a
tableau
that
is
as
logical
as
the
awakening
of
the
sleeping
beauty
after
the
hero
has
explored
all
the
charmed
castle
chapter
x
furniture
trappings
and
inventions
in
motion
the
action
pictures
are
the
intimate
pictures
the
splendor
pictures
many
and
diverse
it
seems
perhaps
to
complete
the
analogy
and
say
they
are
yet
patient
reader
unless
i
am
mistaken
that
assumption
can
be
given
a
value
in
time
without
straining
your
imagination
landscape
gardening
mural
painting
church
building
and
furniture
making
as
well
are
some
of
the
things
that
come
under
the
head
of
architecture
they
are
discussed
between
the
covers
of
any
architectural
magazine
there
is
a
particular
relation
in
the
photoplay
between
crowd
pictures
and
landscape
conceptions
between
patriotic
films
and
mural
paintings
between
religious
films
and
architecture
and
there
is
just
as
much
of
a
relation
between
fairy
tales
and
furniture
which
same
is
discussed
in
this
chapter
let
us
return
to
moving
day
chapter
four
this
idea
has
been
represented
many
times
with
a
certain
sameness
because
the
producers
have
not
thought
out
the
philosophy
behind
it
a
picture
that
is
all
action
is
a
plague
one
that
is
all
elephantine
and
pachydermatous
pageant
is
a
bore
and
most
emphatically
a
film
that
is
all
mechanical
legerdemain
is
a
nuisance
the
possible
charm
in
a
trick
picture
is
in
eliminating
the
tricks
giving
them
dignity
till
they
are
no
longer
such
but
thoughts
in
motion
and
made
visible
in
moving
day
the
shoes
are
the
most
potent
they
go
through
a
drama
that
is
natural
to
them
to
march
without
human
feet
inside
is
but
to
exaggerate
themselves
it
would
not
be
amusing
to
have
them
walk
upside
down
for
instance
as
long
as
the
worn
soles
touch
the
pavement
we
unconsciously
conjure
up
the
character
of
the
absent
owners
about
whom
the
shoes
are
indeed
gossiping
so
let
the
remainder
of
the
furniture
keep
still
while
the
shoes
do
their
best
let
us
call
to
mind
a
classic
involving
shoes
that
are
magical
the
seven
leagued
boots
for
example
or
the
enchanted
moccasins
or
the
footwear
of
puss
in
boots
how
gorgeous
and
embroidered
any
of
these
should
be
and
at
a
crisis
what
sly
antics
they
should
be
brought
to
play
without
fidgeting
all
over
the
shop
slipper
is
not
sufficiently
the
heroine
in
moving
pictures
of
that
story
it
should
be
the
tiny
leading
lady
of
the
piece
in
the
same
sense
the
mighty
is
the
hero
of
the
story
in
chapter
two
the
peasants
when
they
used
to
tell
the
tale
by
the
hearth
fire
said
the
shoe
was
made
of
glass
this
was
in
mediæval
europe
at
a
time
when
glass
was
much
more
of
a
rarity
the
material
was
chosen
to
imply
a
sort
of
jewelled
strangeness
from
the
start
when
cinderella
loses
it
in
her
haste
it
should
flee
at
once
like
a
white
mouse
to
hide
under
the
sofa
it
should
be
pictured
there
with
special
artifice
so
that
the
sensuous
little
foot
of
every
in
the
audience
will
tingle
to
wear
it
it
should
move
a
bit
when
the
prince
comes
frantically
hunting
his
lady
and
peep
out
just
in
time
for
that
royal
personage
to
spy
it
even
at
the
coronation
it
should
be
the
centre
of
the
ritual
more
gazed
at
than
the
crown
and
on
as
dazzling
a
cushion
the
final
taking
on
of
the
slipper
by
the
lady
should
be
as
stately
a
ceremony
as
the
putting
of
the
circlet
of
gold
on
her
aureole
hair
so
much
for
cinderella
but
there
are
novel
stories
that
should
be
evolved
by
preference
about
new
sorts
of
magic
shoes
we
have
not
exhausted
moving
day
the
chairs
kept
still
through
the
cinderella
discourse
now
let
them
take
their
innings
instead
of
having
all
of
them
dance
about
invest
but
one
with
an
inner
life
let
its
special
attributes
show
themselves
but
gradually
reaching
their
climax
at
the
highest
point
of
excitement
in
the
reel
and
being
an
integral
part
of
that
enthusiasm
perhaps
though
we
be
inventing
a
new
it
will
resemble
the
siege
perilous
in
the
arthurian
story
the
chair
where
none
but
the
perfect
knight
could
sit
a
dim
row
of
flaming
swords
might
surround
it
when
the
soul
entitled
to
use
this
throne
appears
the
swords
might
fade
away
and
the
gray
cover
hanging
in
slack
folds
roll
back
because
of
an
inner
energy
and
the
chair
might
turn
from
gray
to
white
and
with
a
subtle
change
of
line
become
a
throne
the
photoplay
imagination
which
is
able
to
impart
vital
individuality
to
furniture
will
not
stop
there
let
the
buildings
emanate
conscious
life
the
or
one
or
all
three
will
make
into
a
personality
some
place
akin
to
the
house
of
the
seven
gables
till
the
ancient
building
dominates
the
fancy
as
it
does
in
hawthorne
tale
there
are
various
ways
to
bring
about
this
result
by
having
its
outlines
waver
in
the
twilight
by
touches
of
phosphorescence
or
by
the
passing
of
inexplicable
shadows
or
the
like
it
depends
upon
what
might
be
called
the
genius
of
the
building
there
is
the
poe
story
of
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
where
with
the
death
of
the
last
heir
the
castle
falls
crumbling
into
the
tarn
there
are
other
possible
tales
on
such
terms
never
yet
imagined
to
be
born
great
structures
may
become
in
sort
villains
as
in
the
old
bible
narrative
of
the
origin
of
the
various
languages
the
producer
can
show
the
impious
babel
tower
going
higher
and
higher
into
the
sky
fascinating
and
tempting
the
architects
till
a
confusion
of
tongues
turns
those
masons
into
quarrelling
mobs
that
become
departing
caravans
leaving
her
blasted
and
forsaken
a
symbol
of
every
babylon
that
rose
after
her
there
are
fables
where
the
rocks
and
the
mountains
speak
emerson
has
given
us
one
where
the
mountain
and
the
squirrel
had
a
quarrel
the
mountain
called
the
squirrel
little
prig
and
then
continues
a
clash
of
personalities
more
possible
to
illustrate
than
at
first
appears
here
we
come
to
the
second
stage
of
the
where
the
creature
seems
so
unmanageable
in
his
physical
aspect
that
some
actor
must
be
substituted
who
will
embody
the
essence
of
him
to
properly
illustrate
the
quarrel
of
the
mountain
and
the
squirrel
the
steep
height
should
quiver
and
heave
and
then
give
forth
its
personality
in
the
figure
of
a
vague
smoky
giant
capable
of
human
argument
but
with
in
his
hair
and
bun
perhaps
become
a
jester
in
squirrel
dress
or
it
may
be
our
subject
matter
is
a
tall
dutch
clock
father
time
himself
might
emerge
therefrom
or
supposing
it
is
a
chapel
in
a
knight
adventure
an
angel
should
step
from
the
carving
by
the
door
a
design
that
is
half
angel
half
flower
but
let
the
clock
first
tremble
a
bit
let
the
carving
stir
a
little
and
then
let
the
spirit
come
forth
that
there
may
be
a
fine
relation
between
the
impersonator
and
the
thing
represented
a
statue
too
often
takes
on
life
by
having
the
actor
abruptly
substituted
the
actor
can
not
logically
take
on
more
personality
than
the
statue
has
he
can
only
give
that
personality
expression
in
a
new
channel
in
the
realm
of
letters
a
real
transformation
scene
rendered
credible
to
the
higher
fancy
by
its
slow
cumulative
movement
is
the
tale
of
the
change
of
the
dying
rowena
to
the
living
triumphant
ligeia
in
poe
story
of
that
name
substitution
is
not
the
it
is
transformation
transfiguration
that
is
the
be
it
a
divine
or
a
diabolical
change
there
is
never
more
than
one
witch
in
a
forest
one
siege
perilous
at
any
round
table
but
she
is
indeed
a
witch
and
the
other
is
surely
a
siege
perilous
we
might
define
fairy
splendor
as
furniture
transfigured
for
without
transfiguration
there
is
no
spiritual
motion
of
any
kind
but
the
phrase
serves
a
purpose
it
gets
us
back
to
the
earth
for
a
reason
furniture
is
architecture
and
the
picture
should
certainly
be
drawn
with
architectural
lines
the
normal
is
a
sort
of
tiny
informal
child
religion
the
baby
secular
temple
and
it
should
have
for
the
most
part
that
touch
of
delicate
sublimity
that
we
see
in
the
mountain
chapel
or
grotto
or
fancy
in
the
dwellings
of
aucassin
and
nicolette
when
such
lines
are
drawn
by
the
truly
sophisticated
producer
there
lies
in
them
the
secret
of
a
more
than
ritualistic
power
good
fairy
architecture
amounts
to
an
incantation
in
itself
if
it
is
a
legend
it
must
be
more
than
monumental
in
its
lines
like
the
great
stone
face
of
hawthorne
tale
even
a
chair
can
reach
this
estate
for
instance
let
it
be
the
throne
of
wodin
illustrating
some
passage
in
norse
mythology
if
this
throne
has
a
language
it
speaks
with
the
lightning
if
it
shakes
with
its
threat
it
moves
the
entire
mountain
range
beneath
it
let
the
climb
up
from
the
tricks
of
moving
day
to
the
where
he
can
see
this
throne
against
the
sky
as
a
superarchitect
would
draw
it
but
even
if
he
can
give
this
vision
in
the
films
his
task
will
not
be
worth
while
if
he
is
simply
a
teller
of
old
stories
let
us
have
magic
shoes
about
which
are
more
golden
dreams
than
those
concerning
cinderella
let
us
have
stranger
castles
than
that
of
usher
more
dazzling
chairs
than
the
siege
perilous
let
us
have
the
throne
of
liberty
not
the
throne
of
wodin
there
is
one
outstanding
photoplay
that
i
always
have
in
mind
when
i
think
of
film
magic
it
illustrates
some
principles
of
this
chapter
and
chapter
four
as
well
as
many
others
through
the
book
it
is
production
of
the
avenging
conscience
it
is
also
an
example
of
that
rare
thing
a
use
of
old
material
that
is
so
inspired
that
it
has
the
dignity
of
a
new
creation
the
raw
stuff
of
the
plot
is
pieced
together
from
the
story
of
the
heart
and
the
poem
annabel
lee
it
has
behind
it
in
the
further
distance
poe
conscience
stories
of
the
black
cat
and
william
wilson
i
will
describe
the
film
here
at
length
and
apply
it
to
whatever
chapters
it
illustrates
an
austere
and
cranky
bachelor
well
impersonated
by
spottiswoode
aitken
brings
up
his
orphan
nephew
with
an
awkward
affection
the
nephew
is
impersonated
by
henry
walthall
the
uncle
has
an
ambition
that
the
boy
will
become
a
man
of
letters
in
his
attempts
at
literature
the
youth
is
influenced
by
poe
this
brings
about
the
poe
quality
of
his
dreams
at
the
crisis
the
uncle
is
silently
exasperated
when
he
sees
his
broken
into
and
wasted
as
he
thinks
by
an
affair
with
a
lovely
annabel
blanche
sweet
the
intimacy
and
confidence
of
the
lovers
has
progressed
so
far
that
it
is
a
natural
thing
for
the
artless
girl
to
cross
the
gardens
and
after
hesitation
knock
at
the
door
she
wants
to
know
what
has
delayed
her
boy
she
is
all
in
a
flutter
on
account
of
the
overdue
appointment
to
go
to
a
party
together
the
scene
of
the
pretty
hesitancy
on
the
step
her
knocking
and
the
final
impatient
tapping
with
her
foot
is
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
the
intimate
mood
in
photoplay
episodes
on
the
girl
entrance
the
uncle
overwhelms
her
and
the
boy
by
saying
she
is
pursuing
his
nephew
like
a
common
woman
of
the
town
the
words
actually
burst
through
the
film
not
as
a
melodramatic
but
as
an
actual
insult
this
is
a
thing
almost
impossible
to
do
in
the
photoplay
this
outrage
in
the
midst
of
an
atmosphere
of
chivalry
is
one
of
griffith
it
accounts
for
the
volcanic
fury
of
the
nephew
that
takes
such
trouble
to
burn
itself
out
afterwards
it
is
not
easy
for
the
young
to
learn
that
they
must
let
those
people
flay
them
for
an
hour
who
have
made
every
sacrifice
for
them
through
a
this
scene
of
insult
and
the
confession
scene
later
in
this
film
moved
me
as
similar
passages
in
high
drama
would
do
and
their
very
rareness
even
in
the
hands
of
photoplay
masters
indicates
that
such
purely
dramatic
climaxes
can
not
be
the
main
asset
of
the
moving
picture
over
and
over
with
the
best
talent
and
producers
they
fail
the
boy
and
girl
go
to
the
party
in
spite
of
the
uncle
it
is
while
on
the
way
that
the
boy
looks
on
the
face
of
a
stranger
who
afterwards
mixes
up
in
his
dream
as
the
detective
there
is
a
mistake
in
the
printing
here
there
are
several
minutes
of
a
oriental
dance
to
amuse
the
guests
while
the
lovers
are
alone
at
another
end
of
the
garden
it
is
possibly
the
aptest
contrast
with
the
seriousness
of
our
hero
and
heroine
but
the
social
affair
could
have
had
a
better
title
than
the
one
that
is
printed
on
the
film
an
sweetheart
party
possibly
the
dance
was
put
in
after
the
title
the
lovers
part
forever
the
girl
pride
has
had
a
mortal
wound
about
this
time
is
thrown
on
the
screen
the
kind
of
a
climax
quite
surely
possible
to
the
photoplay
it
reminds
one
not
of
the
mood
of
verse
but
of
the
spirit
of
the
paintings
of
george
frederick
watts
it
is
allied
in
some
way
in
my
mind
with
his
love
and
life
though
but
a
single
draped
figure
within
doors
and
love
and
life
are
undraped
figures
climbing
a
mountain
the
boy
having
said
remembers
the
lady
annabel
it
is
a
crisis
after
the
event
in
his
vision
she
is
shown
in
a
darkened
passageway
all
in
white
looking
out
of
the
window
upon
the
moonlit
sky
simple
enough
in
its
elements
this
vision
is
shown
twice
in
glory
the
third
replica
has
not
the
same
glamour
the
first
two
are
transfigurations
into
divinity
the
phrase
thrown
on
the
screen
is
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
the
sense
of
loss
goes
through
and
through
one
like
a
flight
of
arrows
another
noble
picture
more
realistic
more
sculpturesque
is
of
annabel
mourning
on
her
knees
in
her
room
her
bended
head
makes
her
akin
to
niobe
all
tears
the
boy
meditating
on
a
is
meanwhile
watching
the
spider
in
his
web
devour
the
fly
then
he
sees
the
ants
in
turn
destroy
the
spider
these
pictures
are
shown
on
so
large
a
scale
that
the
spiderweb
fills
the
end
of
the
theatre
then
the
does
the
same
they
can
be
classed
as
particularly
apt
hieroglyphics
in
the
sense
of
chapter
thirteen
their
horror
and
decorative
iridescence
are
of
the
poe
sort
it
is
the
first
hint
of
the
poe
hieroglyphic
we
have
had
except
the
black
patch
over
the
eye
of
the
uncle
along
with
his
jaundiced
cadaverous
face
the
boy
meditates
on
how
all
nature
turns
on
cruelty
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
he
passes
just
now
an
italian
laborer
impersonated
by
george
seigmann
this
laborer
enters
later
into
his
dream
he
finally
goes
to
sleep
in
his
chair
the
resolve
to
kill
his
uncle
rankling
in
his
heart
the
audience
is
not
told
that
a
dream
begins
to
understand
that
one
must
see
the
film
through
twice
but
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
deceive
us
through
our
ignorance
we
share
the
young
hallucinations
entering
into
them
as
imperceptibly
as
he
does
we
think
it
is
the
next
morning
poe
would
start
the
story
just
here
and
here
the
veritable
quality
begins
after
debate
within
himself
as
to
means
the
nephew
murders
his
uncle
and
buries
him
in
the
thick
wall
of
the
chimney
the
italian
laborer
witnesses
the
through
the
window
while
our
consciences
are
aching
and
the
world
crashes
round
us
he
levies
then
for
due
compensation
the
italian
becomes
an
armed
sentinel
the
boy
fears
detection
yet
the
foolish
youth
thinks
he
will
be
happy
but
every
time
he
runs
to
meet
his
sweetheart
he
is
appalled
by
hallucinations
over
her
shoulder
the
cadaverous
ghost
of
the
uncle
is
shown
on
the
screen
several
times
it
is
an
appearance
visible
to
the
young
man
and
the
audience
only
later
the
ghost
is
implied
by
the
actions
of
the
guilty
one
we
merely
imagine
it
this
is
a
piece
of
sound
technique
we
no
more
need
a
dray
full
of
ghosts
than
a
dray
full
of
jumping
furniture
the
village
in
general
has
never
suspected
the
nephew
only
two
people
suspect
him
the
girl
and
an
old
friend
of
his
father
this
gentleman
puts
a
detective
on
the
trail
the
detective
is
impersonated
by
ralph
lewis
the
gradual
breakdown
of
the
victim
is
traced
by
dramatic
degrees
this
is
the
second
case
of
the
thing
i
have
argued
as
being
generally
impossible
in
a
photoplay
chronicle
of
a
private
person
and
which
the
considerations
of
chapter
twelve
indicate
as
exceptional
we
trace
the
innermost
psychology
of
one
special
citizen
step
by
step
to
the
crisis
and
that
path
is
actually
the
primary
interest
of
the
story
the
climax
is
the
confession
to
the
detective
with
this
the
direct
of
the
technique
comes
to
an
end
moreover
poe
would
end
the
story
here
but
the
is
set
like
a
dark
jewel
in
a
gold
ring
of
which
more
anon
let
us
dwell
upon
the
confession
the
first
stage
of
this
is
reached
by
the
dramatization
of
the
heart
reminiscence
in
the
memory
of
the
dreaming
man
the
episode
makes
a
singular
application
of
the
theories
with
which
this
chapter
begins
for
we
have
the
detective
pencil
for
trappings
and
inventions
in
motion
we
have
his
tapping
shoe
and
the
busy
clock
pendulum
because
this
scene
is
so
powerful
the
photoplay
is
described
in
this
chapter
rather
than
any
other
though
the
application
is
more
spiritual
than
literal
the
boy
begins
to
divulge
that
he
thinks
that
the
habitual
ticking
of
the
clock
is
satanically
timed
to
the
beating
of
the
dead
man
heart
here
more
unearthliness
hovers
round
a
pendulum
than
any
merely
mechanical
could
impart
then
the
merest
commonplace
of
the
detective
tapping
his
pencil
in
the
same
time
the
boy
trying
in
vain
to
ignore
it
increases
the
strain
till
the
audience
has
the
hallucinations
of
the
victim
then
the
bold
tapping
of
the
detective
foot
who
would
do
all
his
accusing
without
saying
a
word
and
the
startling
coincidence
of
the
owl
outside
the
window
to
the
same
measure
bring
us
close
to
the
final
breakdown
these
realistic
material
actors
are
as
potent
as
the
actual
apparitions
of
the
dead
man
that
preceded
them
those
visions
prepared
the
mind
to
invest
trifles
with
significance
the
pencil
and
the
pendulum
conducting
themselves
in
an
apparently
everyday
fashion
satisfy
in
a
far
nobler
way
the
thing
in
the
attending
the
show
that
made
him
take
note
in
other
centuries
of
the
rope
that
began
to
hang
the
butcher
the
fire
that
began
to
burn
the
stick
and
the
stick
that
began
to
beat
the
dog
now
the
play
takes
a
higher
demoniacal
plane
reminiscent
of
poe
bells
the
boy
opens
the
door
he
peers
into
the
darkness
there
he
sees
them
they
are
the
nearest
to
the
sinister
poe
quality
of
any
illustrations
i
recall
that
attempt
it
they
are
neither
man
nor
woman
they
are
neither
brute
nor
human
they
are
ghouls
the
scenes
are
designed
with
the
architectural
dignity
that
the
first
part
of
this
chapter
has
insisted
wizard
trappings
should
take
on
now
it
is
that
the
boy
confesses
and
the
poe
story
ends
then
comes
what
the
photoplay
people
call
the
punch
it
is
discussed
at
the
end
of
chapter
nine
it
is
a
kind
of
solar
plexus
blow
to
the
sensibilities
certainly
by
this
time
an
unnecessary
part
of
the
film
usually
every
soul
movement
carefully
built
up
to
where
the
punch
begins
is
forgotten
in
the
material
smash
or
rescue
it
is
not
so
bad
in
this
case
but
it
is
a
too
conventional
proceeding
for
griffith
the
boy
flees
interminably
to
a
barn
too
far
away
there
is
a
siege
by
a
posse
led
by
the
detective
it
is
veritable
border
warfare
the
italian
leads
an
unsuccessful
rescue
party
the
unfortunate
youth
finally
hangs
himself
the
beautiful
annabel
bursts
through
the
siege
a
moment
too
late
then
heart
broken
kills
herself
these
things
are
carried
out
by
good
technicians
but
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
had
the
suicide
with
but
a
tiny
part
of
the
battle
and
the
story
five
reels
long
instead
of
six
this
physical
turmoil
is
carried
into
the
spiritual
world
only
by
the
psychic
momentum
acquired
through
the
previous
confession
scene
the
one
thing
with
intrinsic
pictorial
is
the
death
of
annabel
by
jumping
off
the
sea
cliff
then
comes
the
awakening
to
every
one
who
sees
the
film
for
the
first
time
it
is
like
the
forgiveness
of
sins
the
boy
finds
his
uncle
still
alive
in
revulsion
from
himself
he
takes
the
old
man
into
his
arms
the
uncle
has
already
begun
to
be
ashamed
of
his
terrible
words
and
has
prayed
for
a
contrite
heart
the
radiant
annabel
is
shown
in
the
early
dawn
rising
and
hurrying
to
her
lover
in
spite
of
her
pride
she
will
bravely
take
back
her
last
night
final
word
she
can
not
live
without
him
the
uncle
makes
amends
to
the
girl
the
three
are
in
the
inconsistent
but
very
human
mood
of
sweet
forgiveness
for
love
sake
that
sometimes
overtakes
the
bitterest
of
us
after
some
crisis
in
our
days
the
happy
pair
are
shown
walking
through
the
hills
thrown
upon
the
clouds
for
them
are
the
moods
of
the
heart
they
look
into
the
woods
and
see
his
fancies
of
spring
the
things
that
he
will
some
day
write
these
pageants
might
be
longer
they
furnish
the
great
climax
they
make
a
consistent
parallel
and
contrast
with
the
that
end
with
the
confession
to
the
detective
they
wipe
that
terror
from
the
mind
they
do
not
represent
poe
the
rabbits
the
leopard
the
fairies
cupid
and
psyche
in
the
clouds
and
the
little
loves
from
the
hollow
trees
are
contributions
to
the
original
poetry
of
the
eye
finally
the
central
part
of
this
production
of
the
avenging
conscience
is
no
dilution
of
poe
but
an
adequate
interpretation
a
story
he
might
have
written
those
who
have
the
european
respect
for
poe
work
will
be
most
apt
to
be
satisfied
with
this
section
including
the
photographic
texture
which
may
be
said
to
be
an
authentic
equivalent
of
his
prose
how
often
poe
has
been
primly
patronized
for
his
majestic
quality
the
wizard
power
which
looms
above
all
his
method
and
and
furnishes
the
only
reason
for
its
existence
for
griffith
to
embroider
this
poe
interpretation
in
the
centre
of
a
fairly
consistent
fabric
and
move
on
into
a
radiant
climax
of
his
own
that
is
in
organic
relation
to
the
whole
is
an
achievement
indeed
the
final
criticism
is
that
the
play
is
derivative
it
is
not
built
from
new
material
in
all
its
parts
as
was
the
original
story
one
must
be
a
student
of
poe
to
get
its
ultimate
flavor
but
in
reading
poe
own
stories
one
need
not
be
a
reader
of
any
one
special
preceding
writer
to
get
the
strange
and
solemn
exultation
of
that
literary
enchanter
he
is
the
quintessence
of
his
own
lonely
soul
though
the
wizard
element
is
paramount
in
the
poe
episode
of
this
film
the
appeal
to
the
conscience
is
only
secondary
to
this
it
is
keener
than
in
poe
owing
to
the
human
elements
before
and
after
the
chameleon
producer
approximates
in
the
avenging
conscience
the
type
of
mystic
teacher
discussed
in
the
twentieth
chapter
the
chapter
xi
this
chapter
is
a
superstructure
upon
the
foundations
of
chapters
five
six
and
seven
i
have
said
that
it
is
a
quality
not
a
defect
of
the
photoplays
that
while
the
actors
tend
to
become
types
and
hieroglyphics
and
dolls
on
the
other
hand
dolls
and
hieroglyphics
and
mechanisms
tend
to
become
human
by
an
extension
of
this
principle
tones
textures
lines
and
spaces
take
on
a
vitality
almost
like
that
of
flesh
and
blood
it
is
partly
for
this
reason
that
some
energy
is
hereby
given
to
the
matter
of
reënforcing
the
idea
that
the
people
with
the
proper
training
to
take
the
higher
photoplays
in
hand
are
not
veteran
managers
of
vaudeville
circuits
but
rather
painters
sculptors
and
architects
preferably
those
who
are
in
the
flush
of
their
first
reputation
in
these
crafts
let
us
imagine
the
centres
of
the
experimental
drama
such
as
the
drama
league
the
universities
and
the
stage
societies
calling
in
people
of
these
professions
and
starting
photoplay
competitions
and
enterprises
let
the
thesis
be
here
emphasized
that
the
architects
above
all
are
the
men
to
advance
the
work
in
the
photoplay
but
few
architects
you
say
are
creative
even
in
their
own
profession
let
us
begin
with
the
point
of
view
of
the
highly
trained
pedantic
young
builder
the
type
that
in
the
past
few
years
has
honored
our
landscape
with
those
paradoxical
memorials
of
abraham
lincoln
the
railsplitter
memorials
whose
ionic
columns
are
straight
from
paris
pericles
is
the
real
hero
of
such
a
man
not
lincoln
so
let
him
for
the
time
surrender
completely
to
that
great
greek
he
is
worthy
of
a
monument
nobler
than
any
america
has
set
up
to
any
one
the
final
pictures
may
be
taken
in
front
of
buildings
with
which
the
architect
or
his
favorite
master
has
already
edified
this
republic
or
if
the
war
is
over
before
some
surviving
models
but
whatever
the
method
let
him
study
to
express
at
last
the
thing
that
moves
within
him
as
a
creeping
fire
which
americans
do
not
yet
understand
and
the
loss
of
which
makes
the
classic
in
our
architecture
a
mere
piling
of
elegant
stones
upon
one
another
in
the
arrangement
of
crowds
and
flow
of
costuming
and
study
of
tableau
climaxes
let
the
architect
bring
an
illusion
of
that
delicate
flowering
that
brilliant
instant
of
time
before
the
peloponnesian
war
it
does
not
seem
impossible
when
one
remembers
the
achievements
of
the
author
of
cabiria
in
approximating
rome
and
carthage
let
the
principal
figure
of
the
pageant
be
the
virgin
athena
walking
as
a
presence
visible
only
to
us
yet
among
her
own
people
and
robed
and
armed
and
panoplied
the
guardian
of
pericles
appearing
in
those
streets
that
were
herself
let
the
architect
show
her
as
she
came
only
in
a
vision
to
phidias
while
the
dramatic
writers
and
mathematicians
and
poets
and
philosophers
go
by
the
crowds
should
be
like
pillars
of
athens
and
she
like
a
great
pillar
the
crowds
should
be
like
the
tossing
waves
of
the
ionic
sea
and
athena
like
the
white
ship
upon
the
waves
the
audiences
in
the
tragedies
should
be
shown
like
on
the
always
stately
yet
blown
by
the
wind
and
athena
the
one
sower
and
reaper
crowds
should
descend
the
steps
of
the
acropolis
nymphs
and
fauns
and
olympians
carved
as
it
were
from
the
marble
yet
flowing
like
a
white
cataract
down
into
the
town
bearing
with
them
athena
their
soul
all
this
in
the
photoplay
of
pericles
no
civic
or
national
incarnation
since
that
time
appeals
to
the
poets
like
the
french
worship
of
the
maid
of
orleans
in
percy
mackaye
book
the
present
hour
he
says
on
the
french
attitude
toward
the
war
half
artist
and
half
anchorite
part
siren
and
part
socrates
her
face
alluring
fair
yet
recondite
smiled
through
her
salons
and
academies
lightly
she
wore
her
double
mask
till
sudden
at
war
kindling
spark
her
inmost
self
in
shining
mail
and
casque
blazed
to
the
world
her
single
soul
jeanne
to
make
a
more
elaborate
showing
of
what
is
meant
by
let
us
progress
through
the
centuries
and
suppose
that
the
builder
has
this
enthusiasm
for
france
that
he
is
slowly
setting
about
to
build
a
photoplay
around
the
idea
of
the
maid
first
let
him
take
the
mural
painting
point
of
view
bear
in
mind
these
characteristics
of
that
art
it
is
that
is
an
organic
part
of
the
surface
on
which
it
appears
it
is
on
the
same
lines
as
the
building
and
adapted
to
the
colors
and
forms
of
the
structure
of
which
it
is
a
part
the
of
america
that
are
the
most
scattered
about
in
inexpensive
copies
are
the
decorations
of
the
boston
public
library
note
the
quality
of
sargent
prophets
the
solemn
dignity
of
abbey
holy
grail
series
the
grand
horizontals
and
perpendiculars
of
the
work
of
puvis
de
chavannes
the
last
is
the
orthodox
mural
painter
of
the
world
but
the
other
two
will
serve
the
present
purpose
also
these
architectural
paintings
if
they
were
dramatized
still
retaining
their
powerful
lines
would
be
three
exceedingly
varied
examples
of
what
is
meant
by
the
visions
that
appear
to
jeanne
might
be
delineated
in
the
mood
of
some
one
of
these
three
painters
the
styles
will
not
mix
in
the
same
episode
a
painter
from
old
time
we
mention
here
not
because
he
was
orthodox
but
because
of
his
genius
for
the
drawing
of
action
and
because
he
covered
tremendous
with
venetian
tone
and
color
is
tintoretto
if
there
is
a
mistrust
that
the
mural
painting
standard
will
tend
to
destroy
the
sense
of
action
tintoretto
will
restore
confidence
in
that
regard
as
the
winged
victory
represents
flying
in
sculpture
so
his
work
is
the
extreme
example
of
action
with
the
brush
the
venetians
called
him
the
furious
painter
one
must
understand
a
man
through
his
admirers
so
explore
ruskin
sayings
on
tintoretto
i
have
a
dozen
moving
picture
magazine
clippings
which
are
in
their
humble
way
first
or
second
cousins
of
mural
paintings
i
will
describe
but
two
since
the
method
of
selection
has
already
been
amply
indicated
and
the
reader
can
find
his
own
examples
for
a
crowd
picture
for
instance
here
is
a
scene
at
a
masquerade
ball
the
glitter
of
the
costumes
is
an
extension
of
the
glitter
of
the
candelabra
overhead
the
people
are
as
it
were
chandeliers
hung
lower
down
the
lines
of
the
candelabra
relate
to
the
very
ribbon
streamers
of
the
heroine
and
the
massive
is
the
big
brother
of
the
heroes
in
the
foreground
though
one
is
a
clown
one
is
a
russian
duke
and
one
is
don
cæsar
de
bazan
the
building
is
the
father
of
the
people
these
relations
can
be
kept
in
the
court
scenes
of
the
production
of
jeanne
here
is
a
night
picture
from
a
war
story
in
which
the
light
is
furnished
by
two
fires
whose
coals
and
brands
are
hidden
by
earth
heaped
in
front
the
sentiment
of
tenting
on
the
old
pervades
the
scene
the
far
end
of
the
line
of
those
keeping
bivouac
disappears
into
the
distance
and
the
depths
of
the
ranks
behind
them
fade
into
the
thick
shadows
the
flag
a
little
above
the
line
catches
the
light
one
great
tree
overhead
spreads
its
leafless
arms
through
the
gloom
behind
all
this
is
unmitigated
black
the
composition
reminds
one
of
a
hiroshige
study
of
midnight
these
men
are
certainly
a
part
of
the
architecture
of
out
of
doors
and
mysterious
as
the
vault
of
heaven
this
type
of
a
is
possible
in
our
jeanne
these
pictures
new
and
old
great
and
unknown
indicate
some
of
the
standards
of
judgment
and
types
of
vision
whereby
our
conception
of
the
play
is
to
be
evolved
by
what
means
shall
we
block
it
in
our
friend
tintoretto
made
use
of
methods
which
are
here
described
from
one
of
his
biographers
roscoe
osler
they
have
been
much
enlarged
upon
in
the
different
biographies
as
the
means
whereby
tintoretto
obtained
his
power
they
constituted
however
his
habitual
method
of
determining
the
effect
and
general
grouping
of
his
compositions
he
moulded
with
extreme
care
small
models
of
his
figures
in
wax
and
clay
titian
and
other
painters
as
well
as
tintoretto
employed
this
method
as
the
means
of
determining
the
light
and
shade
of
their
design
afterwards
the
later
stages
of
their
work
were
painted
from
the
life
but
in
tintoretto
compositions
the
position
and
arrangement
of
his
figures
as
he
began
to
dwell
upon
his
great
conceptions
were
such
as
to
render
the
study
from
the
living
model
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
and
at
times
an
impossibility
he
modelled
his
sculptures
imparting
to
his
models
a
far
more
complete
character
than
had
been
customary
these
firmly
moulded
figures
sometimes
draped
sometimes
free
he
suspended
in
a
box
made
of
wood
or
of
cardboard
for
his
smaller
work
in
whose
walls
he
made
an
aperture
to
admit
a
lighted
candle
he
sits
moving
the
light
about
amidst
his
assemblage
of
figures
every
aspect
of
sublimity
of
light
suitable
to
a
madonna
surrounded
with
angels
or
a
heavenly
choir
finds
its
miniature
response
among
the
figures
as
the
light
moves
this
was
the
method
by
which
in
conjunction
with
a
profound
study
of
outward
nature
sympathy
with
the
beauty
of
different
types
of
face
and
varieties
of
form
with
the
many
changing
hues
of
the
venetian
scene
with
the
great
laws
of
color
and
a
knowledge
of
literature
and
history
he
was
able
to
shadow
forth
his
great
imagery
of
the
intuitional
world
this
method
of
tintoretto
suggests
several
possible
derivatives
in
the
preparation
of
motion
pictures
let
the
painters
and
sculptors
be
now
called
upon
for
painting
models
and
sculptural
models
while
the
architect
already
present
supplies
the
architectural
models
all
three
giving
us
visible
scenarios
to
furnish
the
cardinal
motives
for
the
acting
from
which
the
amateur
photoplay
company
of
the
university
can
begin
their
interpretation
for
episodes
that
follow
the
precedent
of
the
simple
action
film
tiny
wax
models
of
the
figures
toned
and
costumed
to
the
heart
delight
would
tell
the
high
points
of
the
story
let
them
represent
perhaps
seven
crucial
situations
from
the
proposed
photoplay
let
them
be
designed
as
uniquely
in
their
dresses
as
are
the
russian
dancers
dresses
by
léon
bakst
then
to
alternate
with
these
seven
little
paintings
of
episodes
designed
in
blacks
whites
and
grays
each
representing
some
elusive
point
in
the
intimate
aspects
of
the
story
let
there
be
a
definite
system
of
space
and
texture
relations
retained
throughout
the
set
the
models
for
the
splendor
scenes
would
of
course
be
designed
by
the
architect
and
these
other
scenes
alternated
with
and
subordinated
to
his
work
the
effects
which
he
would
conceive
would
be
on
a
grander
scale
the
models
for
these
might
be
mere
extensions
of
the
methods
of
those
others
but
in
the
typical
and
highest
let
us
imagine
ourselves
going
beyond
tintoretto
in
preparation
let
the
principal
splendor
moods
and
effects
be
indicated
by
actual
structures
such
miniatures
as
architects
offer
along
with
their
plans
of
public
buildings
but
transfigured
beyond
that
standard
by
the
light
of
inspiration
combined
with
experimental
sunlight
or
torchlight
they
must
not
be
conceived
as
stage
arrangements
of
wax
figures
with
harmonious
and
fitting
backgrounds
but
as
backgrounds
that
clamor
for
utterance
through
the
figures
in
front
of
them
as
athens
finds
her
soul
in
the
athena
with
which
we
began
these
three
sorts
of
models
properly
harmonized
should
have
with
them
a
written
scenario
constructed
to
indicate
all
the
scenes
between
the
scenario
will
lead
up
to
these
models
for
climaxes
and
hold
them
together
in
the
celestial
we
have
in
our
museums
some
definite
architectural
suggestions
as
to
the
style
of
these
models
there
are
in
blackstone
hall
in
the
chicago
art
institute
several
great
romanesque
and
gothic
portals
pillars
and
statues
that
might
tell
directly
upon
certain
settings
of
our
jeanne
pageant
they
are
from
notre
dame
du
port
at
the
abbey
church
of
gilles
the
abbey
of
charlieu
the
cathedral
of
amiens
notre
dame
at
paris
the
cathedral
of
bordeaux
and
the
cathedral
of
rheims
perhaps
the
object
i
care
for
most
in
the
metropolitan
museum
new
york
is
the
complete
model
of
notre
dame
paris
by
joly
why
was
this
model
of
notre
dame
made
with
such
exquisite
pains
certainly
not
as
a
matter
of
mere
information
or
cultivation
i
venture
the
first
right
these
things
have
to
be
taken
care
of
in
museums
is
to
stimulate
to
new
creative
effort
i
went
to
look
over
the
chicago
collection
with
a
friend
and
poet
arthur
davison
ficke
he
said
something
to
this
effect
the
first
thing
i
see
when
i
look
at
these
fragments
is
the
whole
cathedral
in
all
its
original
proportions
then
i
behold
the
mediæval
marketplace
hunched
against
the
building
burying
the
foundations
the
life
of
man
growing
rank
and
weedlike
around
it
then
i
see
the
bishop
coming
from
the
door
with
his
impressive
train
but
a
crusade
may
go
by
on
the
way
to
the
holy
land
a
crusade
may
come
home
battered
and
in
rags
i
get
the
sense
of
life
as
of
a
rapid
in
a
river
flowing
round
a
great
rock
the
cathedral
stands
for
the
meditation
of
the
ascetics
in
the
midst
of
battling
tribes
this
brooding
architecture
has
a
with
the
meditating
jeanne
there
is
in
the
metropolitan
museum
a
large
and
famous
canvas
painted
by
the
dying
jeanne
listening
to
the
voices
it
is
a
picture
of
which
the
technicians
and
the
poets
are
equally
enamored
the
tale
of
jeanne
could
be
told
carrying
this
particular
peasant
girl
through
the
story
and
for
a
piece
of
architectural
pageantry
akin
to
the
photoplay
ballroom
scene
already
described
yet
far
above
it
there
is
nothing
more
apt
for
our
purpose
than
the
painting
by
boutet
de
monvel
filling
the
space
at
the
top
of
the
stair
at
the
chicago
art
institute
though
the
is
a
large
painting
this
is
many
times
the
size
it
shows
joan
visit
at
the
court
of
chinon
it
is
big
without
being
empty
it
conveys
a
glitter
which
expresses
one
of
the
things
that
is
meant
by
the
phrase
splendor
photoplay
but
for
moving
picture
purposes
it
is
the
joan
that
should
appear
here
set
in
dramatic
contrast
to
the
boutet
de
monvel
court
two
valuable
neighbors
to
whom
i
have
read
this
chapter
suggest
that
the
whole
boutet
de
monvel
illustrated
child
book
about
our
heroine
could
be
used
on
this
grand
scale
for
a
background
the
inness
room
at
the
chicago
art
institute
is
another
school
for
the
meditative
producer
if
he
would
evolve
his
tribute
to
france
on
american
soil
though
no
photoplay
tableau
has
yet
approximated
the
brush
of
inness
why
not
attempt
to
lead
jeanne
through
an
inness
landscape
the
trees
are
in
france
but
here
is
an
american
world
in
which
one
could
see
visions
and
hear
voices
where
is
the
inspired
camera
that
will
record
something
of
what
inness
beheld
thus
much
for
the
atmosphere
and
trappings
of
our
jeanne
scenario
where
will
we
get
our
story
it
should
of
course
be
written
from
the
ground
up
for
this
production
but
as
good
americans
we
would
probably
find
a
mass
of
suggestions
in
mark
twain
joan
of
arc
quite
recently
a
moving
picture
company
sent
its
photographers
to
springfield
illinois
and
produced
a
story
with
our
city
for
a
background
using
our
social
set
for
actors
backed
by
the
local
commercial
association
for
whose
benefit
the
thing
was
made
the
resources
of
the
place
were
at
the
command
of
routine
producers
springfield
dressed
its
best
and
acted
with
fair
skill
the
heroine
was
a
charming
débutante
the
hero
the
son
of
governor
dunne
the
mine
owner
daughter
was
at
best
a
mediocre
photoplay
but
this
type
of
event
that
happened
once
may
be
attempted
a
hundred
times
each
time
slowly
improving
which
brings
us
to
something
that
is
in
the
end
very
far
from
the
mine
owner
daughter
by
what
scenario
method
the
following
film
or
series
of
films
is
to
be
produced
i
will
not
venture
to
say
no
doubt
the
way
will
come
if
once
the
dream
has
a
sufficient
hold
i
have
long
maintained
that
my
should
have
a
goddess
like
athena
the
legend
should
be
forthcoming
the
producer
while
not
employing
armies
should
use
many
actors
and
the
tale
be
told
with
the
same
power
with
which
the
productions
of
judith
of
bethulia
and
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
were
evolved
while
the
following
story
may
not
be
the
form
which
springfield
civic
religion
will
ultimately
take
it
is
here
recorded
as
a
second
cousin
of
the
dream
that
i
hope
will
some
day
be
set
forth
late
in
an
afternoon
in
october
a
light
is
seen
in
the
zenith
like
a
dancing
star
the
clouds
form
round
it
in
the
approximation
of
a
circle
now
there
becomes
visible
a
group
of
heads
and
shoulders
of
presences
that
are
looking
down
through
the
ring
of
clouds
watching
the
star
like
giant
children
that
peep
down
a
well
the
jewel
descends
by
four
sparkling
chains
so
far
away
they
look
to
be
dewy
threads
of
silk
as
the
bright
mystery
grows
larger
it
appears
to
be
approaching
the
treeless
hill
of
washington
park
a
hill
that
is
surrounded
by
many
wooded
ridges
the
people
come
running
from
everywhere
to
watch
here
indeed
will
be
a
crowd
picture
with
as
many
phases
as
a
stormy
ocean
flying
machines
appear
from
the
fair
ground
north
of
the
city
and
circle
round
and
round
as
they
go
up
trying
to
reach
the
slowly
descending
plummet
at
last
while
the
throng
cheers
one
has
attained
it
he
brings
back
his
message
that
the
gift
is
an
image
covered
loosely
with
a
wrapping
that
seems
to
be
of
spun
gold
now
the
many
aviators
whirl
round
the
descending
wonder
like
seagulls
playing
about
a
ship
mast
soon
amid
an
awestruck
throng
the
image
is
on
the
hillock
the
golden
chains
and
the
giant
children
holding
them
there
above
have
melted
into
threads
of
mist
and
nothingness
the
shining
wrapping
falls
away
the
people
look
upon
a
seated
statue
of
marble
and
gold
there
is
a
branch
of
maple
leaves
in
her
hands
then
beside
the
image
is
a
fluttering
transfigured
presence
of
which
the
image
seems
to
be
a
representation
this
spirit
carrying
a
living
maple
branch
in
her
hand
says
to
the
people
men
and
women
of
springfield
this
carving
is
the
lady
springfield
sent
by
your
lord
from
heaven
build
no
canopy
over
her
let
her
ever
be
under
the
do
her
perpetual
honor
the
messenger
who
is
the
soul
and
voice
of
springfield
fades
into
the
crowd
to
emerge
on
great
and
terrible
occasions
this
is
only
one
story
round
this
public
event
let
the
photoplay
romancer
weave
what
tales
of
private
fortune
he
will
narratives
bound
up
with
the
events
of
that
october
day
as
the
story
of
nathan
and
naomi
is
woven
into
judith
of
bethulia
henceforth
the
city
officers
are
secular
priests
of
our
lady
springfield
their
failure
in
duty
is
a
profanation
of
her
name
a
yearly
pledge
of
the
first
voters
is
taken
in
her
presence
like
the
old
athenian
oath
of
citizenship
the
seasonal
pageants
march
to
the
statue
feet
scattering
flowers
the
important
outdoor
festivals
are
given
on
the
edge
of
her
hill
all
the
roads
lead
to
her
footstool
pilgrims
come
from
the
seven
seas
to
look
upon
her
face
that
is
carved
by
invisible
powers
moreover
the
living
messenger
that
is
her
actual
soul
appears
in
dreams
or
visions
of
the
open
day
when
the
days
are
dark
for
the
city
when
her
patriots
are
irresolute
and
her
children
are
put
to
shame
this
spirit
with
the
maple
branch
rallies
them
leads
them
to
victories
like
those
that
were
won
of
old
in
the
name
of
jeanne
or
pallas
athena
herself
chapter
xii
thirty
differences
between
the
photoplays
and
the
stage
the
stage
is
dependent
upon
three
lines
of
tradition
first
that
of
greece
and
rome
that
came
down
through
the
french
second
the
english
style
ripened
from
the
miracle
play
and
the
shakespearian
stage
and
third
the
ibsen
precedent
from
norway
now
so
firmly
established
it
is
classic
these
methods
are
obscured
by
the
commercialized
dramas
but
they
are
behind
them
all
let
us
discuss
for
illustration
the
ibsen
tradition
ibsen
is
generally
the
vitriolic
foe
of
pageant
he
must
be
read
aloud
he
stands
for
the
spoken
word
for
the
iron
power
of
life
that
may
be
concentrated
in
a
phrase
like
the
all
or
nothing
of
brand
though
peer
gynt
has
its
spectacular
side
ibsen
generally
comes
in
through
the
ear
alone
he
can
be
acted
in
essentials
from
end
to
end
with
one
table
and
four
chairs
in
any
parlor
the
alleged
punch
with
which
the
movie
culminates
has
occurred
three
or
ten
years
before
the
ibsen
curtain
goes
up
at
the
close
of
every
act
of
the
dramas
of
this
norwegian
one
might
inscribe
on
the
curtain
this
the
magnificent
moving
picture
can
not
achieve
likewise
after
every
successful
film
described
in
this
book
could
be
inscribed
this
the
trenchant
ibsen
can
not
do
but
a
photoplay
of
ghosts
came
to
our
town
the
humor
of
the
prospect
was
the
sort
too
deep
for
tears
my
pastor
and
i
reread
the
william
archer
translation
that
we
might
be
alert
for
every
antithesis
together
we
went
to
the
services
since
then
the
film
has
been
furiously
denounced
by
the
literati
floyd
dell
discriminating
assault
upon
it
is
quoted
in
current
opinion
october
and
margaret
anderson
prints
a
denunciation
of
it
in
a
recent
number
of
the
little
review
but
it
is
not
such
a
bad
film
in
itself
it
is
not
ibsen
it
should
be
advertised
the
iniquities
of
the
fathers
an
american
drama
of
eugenics
in
a
palatial
setting
henry
walthall
as
alving
afterward
as
his
son
shows
the
men
much
as
ibsen
outlines
their
characters
of
course
the
only
way
to
be
ibsen
is
to
be
so
precisely
in
the
new
plot
all
is
open
as
the
day
the
world
is
welcome
and
generally
present
when
the
man
or
his
son
go
forth
to
see
the
elephant
and
hear
the
owl
provincial
hypocrisy
is
not
implied
but
ibsen
can
scarcely
exist
without
an
atmosphere
of
secrecy
for
his
human
volcanoes
to
burst
through
in
the
end
mary
alden
as
alving
shows
in
her
intelligent
and
sensitive
countenance
that
she
has
a
conception
of
that
character
she
does
not
always
have
the
chance
to
act
the
woman
written
in
her
face
the
tart
thinking
handsome
creature
that
ibsen
prefers
nigel
debrullier
looks
the
pastor
manders
even
to
caricature
but
the
crawling
bootlicking
carpenter
jacob
engstrand
is
changed
into
a
respectable
guileless
man
with
an
income
and
his
wife
and
daughter
are
helpless
conventional
rabbits
they
do
not
remind
one
of
the
saucy
originals
the
original
ibsen
drama
is
the
result
of
mixing
up
five
particular
characters
through
three
acts
there
is
not
a
situation
but
would
go
to
pieces
if
one
personality
were
altered
here
are
two
sadly
tampered
with
engstrand
and
his
daughter
here
is
the
mother
who
is
only
referred
to
in
ibsen
here
is
the
elder
alving
who
disappears
before
the
original
play
starts
so
the
twenty
great
ibsen
situations
in
the
stage
production
are
gone
one
new
crisis
has
an
ibsen
irony
and
psychic
tension
the
boy
is
taken
with
the
dreaded
intermittent
pains
in
the
back
of
his
head
he
is
painting
the
order
that
is
to
make
him
famous
the
king
portrait
while
the
room
empties
of
people
he
writhes
on
the
floor
if
this
were
all
it
would
have
been
one
more
moving
picture
failure
to
put
through
a
tragic
scene
but
the
thing
is
reiterated
in
he
is
looking
sideways
in
terror
a
hairy
arm
with
clutching
demon
claws
comes
thrusting
in
toward
the
back
of
his
neck
he
writhes
in
deadly
fear
the
audience
is
appalled
for
him
this
visible
clutch
of
heredity
is
the
nearest
equivalent
that
is
offered
for
the
whispered
refrain
ghosts
in
the
original
masterpiece
this
hand
should
also
be
reiterated
as
a
refrain
three
times
at
least
before
this
tableau
each
time
more
dreadful
and
threatening
it
appears
but
the
once
and
has
no
chance
to
become
a
part
of
the
accepted
hieroglyphics
of
the
piece
as
it
should
be
to
realize
its
full
power
the
father
previous
sins
have
been
acted
out
the
boy
consequent
struggle
with
the
malady
has
been
traced
step
by
step
so
the
play
should
end
here
it
would
then
be
a
rough
equivalent
of
the
ibsen
irony
in
a
contrary
medium
instead
of
that
it
wanders
on
through
paraphrases
of
scraps
of
the
play
sometimes
literal
then
quite
alien
on
to
the
alleged
motion
picture
punch
when
the
doctor
is
the
god
from
the
machine
there
is
no
doctor
on
the
stage
in
the
original
ghosts
but
there
is
a
physician
in
the
doll
house
a
scientific
quietly
moving
oracle
crisp
spartan
sophisticated
is
this
photoplay
physician
such
a
one
the
boy
and
his
are
in
their
in
the
big
church
pastor
manders
is
saying
the
ceremony
the
audience
and
building
are
indeed
showy
the
doctor
charges
up
the
aisle
at
the
moment
people
are
told
to
speak
or
forever
hold
their
peace
he
has
tact
he
simply
breaks
up
the
marriage
right
there
he
does
not
tell
the
guests
why
but
he
takes
the
wedding
party
into
the
study
and
there
blazes
at
the
bride
and
groom
the
truth
that
they
are
brother
and
sister
always
an
orotund
man
he
has
the
chautauqua
manner
indeed
in
this
exigency
he
brings
to
one
mind
the
tearful
book
much
loved
in
childhood
parted
at
the
altar
or
why
was
it
thus
and
four
able
actors
have
the
task
of
telling
the
audience
by
facial
expression
only
that
they
have
been
struck
by
moral
lightning
they
stand
in
a
row
facing
the
people
endeavoring
to
make
the
crisis
of
an
alleged
ibsen
play
out
of
a
crashing
melodrama
the
final
death
of
young
alving
is
depicted
with
an
approximation
of
ibsen
mood
but
the
only
ways
to
suggest
such
feelings
in
silence
do
not
convey
them
in
full
to
the
audience
but
merely
narrate
them
wherever
in
ghosts
we
have
quiet
voices
that
are
like
the
slow
drip
of
hydrochloric
acid
in
the
photoplay
we
have
no
quiet
gestures
that
will
do
trenchant
work
instead
there
are
endless
writhings
and
rushings
about
done
with
a
deal
of
skill
but
destructive
of
the
last
remnants
of
ibsen
up
past
the
point
of
the
clutching
hand
this
film
is
the
prime
example
for
study
for
the
person
who
would
know
once
for
all
the
differences
between
the
photoplays
and
the
stage
dramas
along
with
it
might
be
classed
fiske
decorative
moving
picture
tess
in
which
there
is
every
determination
to
convey
the
original
fiske
illusion
without
her
voice
and
breathing
presence
to
people
who
know
her
well
it
is
a
surprisingly
good
tintype
of
our
beloved
friend
for
the
family
album
the
relentless
thomas
hardy
is
nowhere
to
be
found
there
are
two
moments
of
dramatic
life
set
among
many
of
delicious
pictorial
quality
when
tess
baptizes
her
child
and
when
she
smooths
its
little
grave
with
a
wavering
hand
but
in
the
the
dramatic
poignancy
begins
with
the
going
up
of
the
curtain
and
lasts
till
it
descends
the
prime
example
of
complete
failure
is
sarah
bernhardt
camille
it
is
indeed
a
tintype
of
the
consumptive
heroine
with
every
group
entire
and
taken
at
full
length
much
space
is
occupied
by
the
floor
and
the
overhead
portions
of
the
stage
setting
it
lasts
as
long
as
would
the
spoken
performance
and
wherever
there
is
a
dialogue
we
must
imagine
said
conversation
if
we
can
it
might
be
compared
to
watching
camille
from
the
top
gallery
through
smoked
glass
with
one
ears
stopped
with
cotton
it
would
be
well
for
the
beginning
student
to
find
some
way
to
see
the
first
two
of
these
three
or
some
other
attempts
to
revamp
the
classic
for
instance
fiske
painstaking
reproduction
of
vanity
fair
bearing
in
mind
the
list
of
differences
which
this
chapter
now
furnishes
there
is
no
denying
that
many
stage
managers
who
have
taken
up
photoplays
are
struggling
with
the
shakespearian
french
and
norwegian
traditions
in
the
new
medium
many
of
the
moving
pictures
discussed
in
this
book
are
rewritten
stage
dramas
and
one
judith
of
bethulia
is
a
pronounced
success
but
in
order
to
be
real
photoplays
the
stage
dramas
must
be
overhauled
indeed
turned
inside
out
and
upside
down
the
successful
motion
picture
expresses
itself
through
mechanical
devices
that
are
being
evolved
every
hour
upon
those
many
new
bits
of
machinery
are
founded
novel
methods
of
combination
in
another
field
of
logic
not
dramatic
logic
but
tableau
logic
but
the
managers
taking
up
photoplays
begin
by
making
curious
miniatures
of
stage
presentations
they
try
to
have
most
things
as
before
later
they
take
on
the
moving
picture
technique
in
a
superficial
way
but
they
and
the
host
of
talented
actors
in
the
prime
of
life
and
broadway
success
retain
the
dramatic
state
of
mind
it
is
a
principle
of
criticism
the
world
over
that
the
distinctions
between
the
arts
must
be
clearly
marked
even
by
those
who
afterwards
mix
those
arts
take
for
instance
the
perpetual
quarrel
between
the
artists
and
the
about
literary
painting
whistler
fought
that
battle
in
england
he
tried
to
beat
it
into
the
head
of
john
bull
that
a
painting
is
one
thing
a
mere
illustration
for
a
story
another
thing
but
the
novice
is
always
stubborn
to
him
hindu
and
arabic
are
both
foreign
languages
therefore
just
alike
the
book
illustration
may
be
said
to
come
in
through
the
ear
by
reading
the
title
aloud
in
imagination
and
the
other
is
effective
with
no
title
at
all
the
scenario
writer
who
will
study
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
in
whistler
gentle
art
of
making
enemies
will
be
equipped
to
welcome
the
distinction
between
the
stage
where
the
word
rules
and
the
photoplay
where
splendor
and
ritual
are
all
it
is
not
the
same
distinction
but
a
kindred
one
but
let
us
consider
the
details
of
the
matter
the
stage
has
its
exits
and
entrances
at
the
side
and
back
the
standard
photoplays
have
their
exits
and
entrances
across
the
imaginary
footlight
line
even
in
the
most
stirring
mob
and
battle
scenes
in
judith
of
bethulia
though
the
people
seem
to
be
coming
from
everywhere
and
going
everywhere
when
we
watch
close
we
see
that
the
individuals
enter
at
the
near
corner
and
exit
at
the
near
corner
or
enter
at
the
near
corner
and
exit
at
the
near
corner
consider
the
devices
whereby
the
stage
actor
holds
the
audience
as
he
goes
out
at
the
side
and
back
he
sighs
gestures
howls
and
strides
with
what
studious
preparation
he
ripens
his
quietness
if
he
goes
out
that
way
in
the
new
contraption
the
moving
picture
the
hero
or
villain
in
exit
strides
past
the
nose
of
the
camera
growing
much
bigger
than
a
human
being
marching
toward
us
as
though
he
would
step
on
our
heads
disappearing
when
largest
there
is
an
explosive
power
about
the
mildest
motion
picture
exit
be
the
actor
skilful
or
the
reverse
the
people
left
in
the
scene
are
pygmies
compared
with
each
disappearing
cyclops
likewise
when
the
actor
enters
again
his
mechanical
importance
is
overwhelming
therefore
for
his
first
entrance
the
motion
picture
star
does
not
require
the
preparations
that
are
made
on
the
stage
the
support
does
not
need
to
warm
the
spectators
to
the
problem
then
talk
them
into
surrender
when
the
veteran
as
a
beginning
photoplay
producer
tries
to
give
us
a
dialogue
in
the
motion
pictures
he
makes
it
so
dull
no
one
follows
he
does
not
realize
that
his
opportunity
to
magnify
persons
and
things
instantly
to
interweave
them
as
actors
on
one
level
to
alternate
scenes
at
the
slightest
whim
are
the
big
substitutes
for
dialogue
by
alternating
scenes
rapidly
flash
after
flash
cottage
field
field
cottage
we
have
a
conversation
between
three
places
rather
than
three
persons
by
alternating
the
picture
of
a
man
and
the
check
he
is
forging
we
have
his
soliloquy
when
two
people
talk
to

it
is
by
lifting
and
lowering
objects
rather
than
their
voices
the
collector
presents
a
bill
the
adventurer

him
the
door
the

plucks

the

the

producer
feeling
he
is
getting
nowhere
but
still
helpless
puts
the
climax
of
some
puzzling
often
the
climax
of
the
whole
film
as
a
sentence
on
the
screen
sentences
should
be
used
to
show
changes
of
time
and
place
and
a
few
such
elementary
matters
before
the
episode
is
fully
started
the
climax
of
a
motion
picture
scene
can
not
be
one
word
or
fifty
words
as
has
been
discussed
in
connection
with
cabiria
the
crisis
must
be
an
action
sharper
than
any
that
has
gone
before
in
organic
union
with
a
tableau
more
beautiful
than
any
that
has
preceded
the
breaking
of
the
tenth
wave
upon
the
sand
such
remnants
of
pantomimic
dialogue
as
remain
in
the
main
chase
of
the
photoplay
film
are
but
in
the
race
toward
the
goal
they
should
not
be
elaborate
of
plot
to
be
laboriously
lifted
and
lowered
while
the
horses
stop
the
venus
of
milo
that
comes
directly
to
the
soul
through
the
silence
requires
no
quotation
from
keats
to
explain
her
though
keats
is
the
equivalent
in
verse
her
setting
in
the
great
french
museum
is
enough
we
do
not
know
that
her
name
is
venus
she
is
thought
by
many
to
be
another
statue
of
victory
we
may
some
day
evolve
scenarios
that
will
require
nothing
more
than
a
title
thrown
upon
the
screen
at
the
beginning
they
come
to
the
eye
so
perfectly
this
is
not
the
only
possible
sort
but
the
limitation
in
certain
films
might
give
them
a
charm
akin
to
that
of
the
songs
without
words
the
stage
audience
is
a
unit
of
three
hundred
or
a
thousand
in
the
beginning
of
the
first
act
there
is
much
moving
about
and
extra
talk
on
the
part
of
the
actors
to
hold
the
crowd
while
it
is
settling
down
and
enable
the
to
be
in
his
seat
before
the
vital
part
of
the
story
starts
if
he
appears
later
he
is
glared
at
in
the
motion
picture
art
gallery
on
the
other
hand
the
audience
is
around
two
hundred
and
these
are
not
a
unit
and
the
only
crime
is
to
obstruct
the
line
of
vision
the
girls
can
do
a
moderate
amount
of
giggling
without
breaking
the
spell
there
is
no
spell
in
the
stage
sense
to
break
people
can
climb
over
each
other
knees
to
get
in
or
out
if
the
picture
is
political
they
murmur
to
one
another
if
the
film
suggests
what
some
of
the
neighbors
have
been
doing
they
can
regale
each
other
with
the
richest
sewing
society
report
the
people
in
the
motion
picture
audience
total
about
two
hundred
any
time
but
they
come
in
groups
of
two
or
three
at
no
specified
hour
the
newcomers
do
not
as
in
vaudeville
make
themselves
part
of
a
jocular
army
strictly
as
individuals
they
judge
the
panorama
if
they
disapprove
there
is
grumbling
under
their
breath
but
no
hissing
i
have
never
heard
an
audience
in
a
photoplay
theatre
clap
its
hands
even
when
the
house
was
bursting
with
people
yet
they
often
see
the
film
through
twice
when
they
have
had
enough
they
stroll
home
they
manifest
their
favorable
verdict
by
sending
some
other
member
of
the
family
to
see
the
picture
if
the
people
so
delegated
are
likewise
satisfied
they
may
ask
the
man
at
the
door
if
he
is
going
to
bring
it
back
that
is
the
moving
picture
kind
of
cheering
it
was
a
theatrical
sin
when
the
stage
actor
was
rendered
unimportant
by
his
scenery
but
the
motion
picture
actor
is
but
the
mood
of
the
mob
or
the
landscape
or
the
department
store
behind
him
reduced
to
a
single
hieroglyphic
the
is
large
the
interior
is
small
the
stage
scene
is
at
best
artificial
and
little
and
is
generally
at
rest
or
its
movement
is
tainted
with
artificiality
the
waves
dash
but
not
dashingly
the
water
flows
but
not
flowingly
the
motion
picture
scene
is
as
big
as
the
universe
and
only
pictures
of
the
sahara
are
without
magnificent
motion
the
photoplay
is
as
far
from
the
stage
on
the
one
hand
as
it
is
from
the
novel
on
the
other
its
nearest
analogy
in
literature
is
perhaps
the
short
story
or
the
lyric
poem
the
of
the
stage
are
and
of
the
photoplay
and
the
stage
in
its
greatest
power
deals
with
pity
for
some
one
especially
unfortunate
with
whom
we
grow
well
acquainted
with
some
private
revenge
against
some
particular
despoiler
traces
the
beginning
and
culmination
of
joy
based
on
the
gratification
of
some
preference
or
love
for
some
person
whose
charm
is
all
his
own
the
drama
is
concerned
with
the
slow
inevitable
approaches
to
these
intensities
on
the
other
hand
the
motion
picture
though
often
appearing
to
deal
with
these
things
as
a
matter
of
fact
uses
substitutes
many
of
which
have
been
listed
but
to
review
its
first
substitute
is
the
excitement
of
stretched
on
the
framework
of
an
obvious
plot
or
it
deals
with
delicate
informal
anecdote
as
the
short
story
does
or
fairy
legerdemain
or
patriotic
banners
or
great
surging
mobs
of
the
proletariat
or
big
scenic
outlooks
or
miraculous
beings
made
visible
and
the
further
it
gets
from
euripides
ibsen
shakespeare
or
molière
the
more
it
becomes
like
a
mural
painting
from
which
flashes
of
lightning
come
the
more
it
realizes
its
genius
men
like
gordon
craig
and
granville
barker
are
almost
wasting
their
genius
on
the
theatre
the
splendor
photoplays
are
the
great
outlet
for
their
type
of
imagination
the
typical
stage
performance
is
from
two
hours
and
a
half
upward
the
movie
show
generally
lasts
five
reels
that
is
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
and
it
should
last
but
three
reels
that
is
an
hour
edgar
poe
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
long
poem
there
is
certainly
no
such
thing
as
a
long
moving
picture
masterpiece
the
depends
most
largely
upon
the
power
of
the
actors
the
movie
show
upon
the
genius
of
the
producer
the
performers
and
the
dumb
objects
are
on
equal
terms
in
his
the
is
bad
for
the
stage
because
the
minor
parts
are
smothered
and
the
situations
distorted
to
give
the
favorite
an
orbit
it
is
bad
for
the
motion
pictures
because
it
obscures
the
producer
while
the
leading
actor
is
entitled
to
his
glory
as
are
all
the
actors
their
mannerisms
should
not
overshadow
the
latest
inspirations
of
the
creator
of
the
films
the
display
of
the
name
of
the
corporation
is
no
substitute
for
giving
the
glory
to
the
producer
an
artistic
photoplay
is
not
the
result
of
a
military
efficiency
system
it
is
not
a
staple
article
but
the
product
of
the
creative
force
of
one
soul
the
flowering
of
a
spirit
that
has
the
habit
of
perpetually
renewing
itself
once
i
saw
mary
fuller
in
a
classic
it
was
the
life
and
death
of
mary
queen
of
scots
not
only
was
the
tense
fidgety
mary
fuller
transformed
into
a
being
who
was
a
poppy
and
a
and
a
and
a
rose
but
she
and
her
company
including
marc
macdermott
radiated
the
old
scotch
patriotism
they
made
the
picture
a
memorial
it
reminded
one
of
maurice
hewlett
novel
the
queen
quair
evidently
all
the
actors
were
fused
by
some
noble
managerial
mood
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
so
able
a
group
have
evolved
many
good
films
that
have
escaped
me
but
though
i
did
go
again
and
again
never
did
i
see
them
act
with
the
same
deliberation
and
distinction
and
i
laid
the
difference
to
a
change
in
the
state
of
mind
of
the
producer
even
baseball
players
must
have
managers
a
team
can
not
pick
itself
or
it
surely
would
and
this
rule
may
apply
to
the
stage
but
by
comparison
to
motion
picture
performers
are
their
own
managers
for
they
have
an
approximate
notion
of
how
they
look
in
the
eye
of
the
audience
which
is
but
the
human
eye
they
can
hear
and
gauge
their
own
voices
they
have
the
same
ears
as
their
listeners
but
the
picture
producer
holds
to
his
eyes
the
demon
called
the
kinetoscope
as
the
audience
will
do
later
the
actors
have
not
the
least
notion
of
their
appearance
also
the
words
in
the
motion
picture
are
not
things
whose
force
the
actor
can
gauge
the
book
under
the
table
is
one
word
the
dog
behind
the
chair
is
another
the
window
curtain
flying
in
the
breeze
is
another
this
chapter
has
implied
that
the
performers
were
but
paint
on
the
canvas
they
are
both
paint
and
models
they
are
models
in
the
sense
that
the
young
ellen
terry
was
the
inspiration
for
watts
sir
galahad
they
resemble
the
persons
in
private
life
who
furnish
the
basis
for
novels
dickens
mother
was
the
original
of
nickleby
his
father
entered
into
wilkins
micawber
but
these
people
are
not
perpetually
thrust
upon
us
as
and
dickens
we
are
glad
to
find
them
in
the
dickens
biographies
when
the
stories
begin
it
is
micawber
and
nickleby
we
want
and
the
charles
dickens
atmosphere
the
photoplays
of
the
future
will
be
written
from
the
foundations
for
the
films
the
soundest
actors
photographers
and
producers
will
be
those
who
emphasize
the
points
wherein
the
photoplay
is
unique
what
is
adapted
to
complete
expression
in
one
art
generally
secures
but
half
expression
in
another
the
supreme
photoplay
will
give
us
things
that
have
been
but
half
expressed
in
all
other
mediums
allied
to
it
once
this
principle
is
grasped
there
is
every
reason
why
the
same
people
who
have
interested
themselves
in
the
advanced
experimental
drama
should
take
hold
of
the
the
good
citizens
who
can
most
easily
grasp
the
distinction
should
be
there
to
perpetuate
the
higher
welfare
of
these
institutions
side
by
side
this
parallel
development
should
come
if
for
no
other
reason
because
the
two
arts
are
still
roughly
classed
together
by
the
public
the
elect
can
not
teach
the
public
what
the
drama
is
till
they
show
them
precisely
what
the
photoplay
is
and
is
not
just
as
the
university
has
departments
of
both
history
and
english
teaching
in
amity
each
one
illuminating
the
work
of
the
other
so
these
two
forms
should
live
in
each
other
sight
in
fine
and
friendly
contrast
at
present
they
are
in
blind
and
jealous
warfare
chapter
xiii
hieroglyphics
i
have
read
this
chapter
to
a
pretty
neighbor
who
has
approved
of
the
preceding
portions
of
the
book
whose
mind
therefore
i
can
not
but
respect
my
neighbor
classes
this
discussion
of
hieroglyphics
as
a
fanciful
flight
rather
than
a
sober
argument
i
submit
the
verdict
then
struggle
against
it
while
you
read
the
invention
of
the
photoplay
is
as
great
a
step
as
was
the
beginning
of
in
the
stone
age
and
the
and
women
of
our
slums
seem
to
be
the
people
most
affected
by
this
novelty
which
is
but
an
expression
of
the
old
in
that
spiral
of
life
which
is
going
higher
while
seeming
to
repeat
the
ancient
phase
there
happens
to
be
here
on
the
table
a
book
on
egypt
by
rawlinson
that
i
used
to
thumb
long
ago
a
footnote
says
the
font
of
hieroglyphic
type
used
in
this
work
contains
eight
hundred
forms
but
there
are
many
other
forms
beside
there
is
more
light
on
egypt
in
later
works
than
in
rawlinson
but
the
statement
quoted
will
serve
for
our
text
several
complex
methods
of
making
visible
scenarios
are
listed
in
this
work
here
is
one
that
is
mechanically
simple
let
the
man
searching
for
tableau
combinations
even
if
he
is
of
the
practical
commercial
type
prepare
himself
with
eight
hundred
signs
from
egypt
he
can
construct
the
outlines
of
his
scenarios
by
placing
these
little
pictures
in
rows
it
may
not
be
impractical
to
cut
his
hundreds
of
them
from
black
cardboard
and
shuffle
them
on
his
table
every
morning
the
list
will
contain
all
elementary
and
familiar
things
let
him
first
give
the
most
literal
meaning
to
the
patterns
then
if
he
desires
to
rise
above
the
commercial
field
let
him
turn
over
each
cardboard
making
the
white
undersurface
uppermost
and
there
write
a
more
abstract
meaning
of
the
hieroglyphic
one
that
has
a
fairly
close
relation
to
his
way
of
thinking
about
the
primary
form
from
a
proper
balance
of
primary
and
secondary
meanings
photoplays
with
souls
could
come
not
that
he
must
needs
become
an
expert
egyptologist
yet
it
would
profit
any
photoplay
man
to
study
to
think
like
the
egyptians
the
great
people
there
is
as
much
reason
for
this
course
as
for
the
bible
student
apprenticeship
in
hebrew
hieroglyphics
can
prove
their
worth
even
without
the
help
of
an
egyptian
history
humorous
and
startling
analogies
can
be
pointed
out
by
opening
the
standard
dictionary
page
look
under
the
word
there
is
the
diagram
of
the
evolution
of
inscriptions
from
the
egyptian
and
phoenician
idea
of
what
letters
should
be
on
through
the
greek
and
roman
systems
in
the
egyptian
row
is
the
picture
of
a
throne
illustration
that
has
its
equivalent
in
the
roman
letter
and
a
throne
has
as
much
place
in
what
might
be
called
the
alphabet
as
the
letter
c
has
in
ours
there
are
sometimes
three
thrones
in
this
small
town
of
springfield
in
an
evening
when
you
see
one
flashed
on
the
screen
you
know
instantly
you
are
dealing
with
royalty
or
its
implications
the
last
one
i
saw
that
made
any
particular
impression
was
when
mary
pickford
acted
in
such
a
little
queen
i
only
wished
then
that
she
had
a
more
convincing
throne
let
us
cut
one
out
of
black
cardboard
turning
the
cardboard
over
to
write
on
it
the
we
inscribe
some
such
phrase
as
the
throne
of
wisdom
or
the
throne
of
liberty
here
is
the
hieroglyphic
of
a
hand
illustration
roman
equivalent
the
letter
the
human
hand
magnified
till
it
is
as
big
as
the
whole
screen
is
as
useful
in
the
moving
picture
alphabet
as
the
letter
d
in
the
printed
alphabet
this
hand
may
open
a
lock
it
may
pour
poison
in
a
bottle
it
may
work
a
telegraph
key
then
turning
the
white
side
of
the
cardboard
uppermost
we
inscribe
something
to
the
effect
that
this
hand
may
write
on
the
wall
as
at
the
feast
of
belshazzar
or
it
may
represent
some
such
conception
as
rodin
hand
of
god
discussed
in
the
chapter
here
is
a
duck
illustration
roman
equivalent
the
letter
z
in
the
motion
pictures
this
bird
a
somewhat
animal
suggests
the
finality
of
arcadian
peace
it
is
the
last
and
fittest
ornament
of
the
nothing
very
terrible
can
happen
with
a
duck
in
the
foreground
there
is
no
use
turning
it
over
it
would
take
maeterlinck
or
swedenborg
to
find
the
mystic
meaning
of
a
duck
a
duck
looks
to
me
like
a
caricature
of
an
alderman
here
is
a
sieve
illustration
roman
equivalent
a
sieve
placed
on
the
suggests
domesticity
hired
girl
humors
broad
farce
we
will
expect
the
bride
to
make
her
first
cake
or
the
flour
to
begin
to
fly
into
the
face
of
the
intrusive
but
as
to
the
other
side
of
the
cardboard
the
sieve
has
its
place
in
higher
symbolism
it
has
been
recorded
by
many
a
sage
and
singer
that
the
almighty
powers
sift
men
like
wheat
here
is
the
picture
of
a
bowl
illustration
roman
equivalent
the
letter
a
bowl
seen
through
the
photoplay
window
on
the
cottage
table
suggests
johnny
early
supper
of
bread
and
milk
but
as
to
the
white
side
of
the
cardboard
out
of
a
bowl
of
kindred
form
omar
may
take
his
moonlit
wine
or
the
higher
gods
may
lift
up
the
very
wine
of
time
to
the
lips
of
men
as
swinburne
sings
in
atalanta
in
calydon
here

the

creeps
through
the

to
give
the
primary
of
terror
in
this

the

writer
has
seen
several
valuable
lions
unmistakably
shot
and
killed
in
the
motion
pictures
and
charged
up
to
profit
and
loss
just
as

blown

of
late
there
is
a
disposition
to
use
the
trained
lion

lioness
for
all
sorts
of
effects
no
doubt
the
king
and
queen
of
beasts
will
become
as
versatile

humbly
useful
as
the

itself
that
is
in

we
turn
the

the

described
in

ten

the
ticking
of

here
is
a

the

it
is
a
reminder
of
the
technical
outline
of
this
book
the
intimate
photoplay
as
i
have
said
is
but
a
window
where
we
open
the
shutters
and
peep
into
some
one
cottage
as
to
the
soul
meaning
in
the
opening
or
closing
of
the
shutters
it
ranges
from
noah
opening
the
hatches

send

the

should

this

the

interior
as
has
been
reiterated
is
small

here
the
heroine
does
her
plotting
flirting
and
primping
etc
i
will
leave
the
spiritual
interpretation
of
the
angle
to
emerson
swedenborg
or
maeterlinck
here
is
the
picture
of
a
mouth
illustration
latin
equivalent
the
letter
if
we
turn
from
the
dictionary
to
the
monuments
we
will
see
that
the
egyptians
used
all
the
human
features
in
their
pictures
we
do
not
separate
the
features
as
frequently
as
did
that
ancient
people
but
we
conventionalize
them
as
often
of
the
actors
have
faces
as
fixed
as
the
masks
of
the
greek
chorus
they
have
the
with
the
protruding
chin
the
the
the
fixed
simper
these
formulas
have
their
place
in
the
broad
effects
of
crowd
pictures
and
in
comedies
then
there
are
sudden
abandonments
of
the
mask
griffith
pupils
henry
walthall
and
blanche
sweet
seem
to
me
to
be
the
greatest
people
in
the
photoplays
for
one
reason
their
faces
are
as
sensitive
to
changing
emotion
as
the
surfaces
of
fair
lakes
in
the
wind
there
is
a
passage
in
enoch
arden
where
annie
impersonated
by
lillian
gish
another
pupil
of
griffith
is
waiting
in
suspense
for
the
return
of
her
husband
she
changes
from
lips
of
waiting
with
a
touch
of
apprehension
to
a
delighted
laugh
of
welcome
her
head
making
a
toward
the
door
the
audience
is
so
moved
by
the
beauty
of
the
slow
change
they
do
not
know
whether
her
face
is
the
size
of
the
screen
or
the
size
of
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
fills
the
whole
end
of
the
theatre
thus
much
as
to
faces
that
are
not
hieroglyphics
yet
fixed
facial
hieroglyphics
have
many
legitimate
uses
for
instance
in
the
avenging
conscience
as
the
play
works
toward
the
climax
and
the
guilty
man
is
breaking
down
the
eye
of
the
detective
is
thrown
on
the
screen
with
all
else
hid
in
shadow
a
watching
relentless
eye
and
this
suggests
a
special
talisman
of
the
old
egyptians
a
sign
called
the
eyes
of
horus
meaning
the
sun
here
is
the
picture
of
an
inundated
garden
illustration
latin
equivalent
the
letter
in
our
photoplays
the
garden
is
an
resource
and
at
an
instant
necessity
suggests
the
glory
of
nature
or
sweet
privacy
and
kindred
things
the
egyptian
lotus
garden
had
to
be
inundated
to
be
a
success
ours
needs
but
the
hired
man
with
the
hose
who
sometimes
supplies
broad
comedy
but
we
turn
over
the
cardboard
for
the
deeper
meaning
of
this
hieroglyphic
our
gardens
can
as
of
old
run
the
solemn
range
from
those
of
babylon
to
those
of
the
resurrection
if
there
is
one
sceptic
left
as
to
the
hieroglyphic
significance
of
the
photoplay
let
him
now
be
discomfited
by
page
standard
dictionary
the
last
letter
in
this
list
is
a
lasso
illustration
the
equivalent
of
the
lasso
in
the
roman
alphabet
is
the
letter
the
crude
and
facetious
would
be
apt
to
suggest
that
the
equivalent
of
the
lasso
in
the
photoplay
is
the
word
trouble
possibly
for
the
hero
but
probably
for
the
villain
we
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
symbol
the
noose
may
stand
for
solemn
judgment
and
the
hangman
it
may
also
symbolize
the
snare
of
the
fowler
temptation
then
there
is
the
spider
web
close
kin
representing
the
cruelty
of
evolution
in
the
avenging
conscience
this
list
is
based
on
the
rows
of
hieroglyphics
most
readily
at
hand
any
volume
on
egypt
such
as
one
of
those
by
maspero
has
a
multitude
of
suggestions
for
the
man
inclined
to
the
idea
if
this
system
of
pasteboard
scenarios
is
taken
literally
i
would
like
to
suggest
as
a
beginning
rule
that
in
a
play
based
on
twenty
hieroglyphics
nineteen
should
be
the
black
realistic
signs
with
obvious
meanings
and
only
one
of
them
white
and
inexplicably
strange
it
has
been
proclaimed
further
back
in
this
treatise
that
there
is
only
one
witch
in
every
wood
and
to
illustrate
further
there
is
but
one
scarlet
letter
in
hawthorne
story
of
that
name
but
one
in
all
of
omar
one
bluebird
in
maeterlinck
play
i
do
not
insist
that
the
prospective
adopt
the
hieroglyphic
method
as
a
routine
if
he
but
consents
in
his
meditative
hours
to
the
point
of
view
that
it
implies
the
more
fastidious
photoplay
audience
that
uses
the
hieroglyphic
hypothesis
in
analyzing
the
film
before
it
will
acquire
a
new
tolerance
and
understanding
of
the
avalanche
of
photoplay
conceptions
and
find
a
promise
of
beauty
in
what
have
been
properly
classed
as
mediocre
and
stereotyped
productions
the
nineteenth
chapter
has
a
discourse
on
the
book
of
the
dead
as
a
connecting
link
with
that
chapter
the
reader
will
note
that
one
of
the
marked
things
about
the
egyptian
pictures
on
the
wrappings
papyrus
inscriptions
and
architectural
conceptions
is
that
they
are
but
enlarged
hieroglyphics
while
the
hieroglyphics
are
but
reduced
of
these
so
when
a
few
characters
are
once
understood
the
highly
colored
egyptian
of
the
same
things
are
understood
the
hieroglyphic
of
osiris
is
enlarged
when
they
desire
to
represent
him
in
state
the
hieroglyphic
of
the
soul
as
a
hawk
may
be
in
a
line
of
writing
no
taller
than
the
capitals
of
this
book
immediately
above
may
be
a
big
painting
of
the
soul
the
same
hawk
placed
with
the
proper
care
with
reference
to
its
composition
on
the
wall
a
pure
decoration
the
transition
from
reduction
to
enlargement
and
back
again
is
as
rapid
in
egypt
as
in
the
photoplay
it
follows
among
other
things
that
in
egypt
as
in
china
and
japan
literary
style
and
mere
penmanship
and
brushwork
are
to
be
conceived
as
inseparable
no
doubt
the
egyptian
scholar
was
the
man
who
could
not
only
compose
a
poem
but
write
it
down
with
a
brush
talent
for
poetry
deftness
in
inscribing
and
skill
in
mural
painting
were
probably
gifts
of
the
same
person
the
photoplay
goes
back
to
this
primitive
union
in
styles
the
stages
from
hieroglyphics
through
phoenician
and
greek
letters
to
ours
are
of
no
particular
interest
here
but
the
fact
that
hieroglyphics
can
evolve
is
important
let
us
hope
that
our
new
can
take
on
richness
and
significance
as
time
goes
on
without
losing
their
literal
values
they
may
develop
into
something
more
yet
more
highly
wrought
than
any
written
speech
languages
when
they
evolve
produce
stylists
and
we
will
some
day
distinguish
the
different
photoplay
masters
as
we
now
delight
in
the
separate
tang
of
henry
and
mark
twain
and
howells
when
these
are
ancient
times
we
will
have
scholars
and
critics
learned
in
the
flavors
of
early
moving
picture
traditions
with
their
histories
of
movements
and
schools
their
grammars
and
anthologies
now
some
words
as
to
the
language
and
its
relation
to
pictures
in
england
and
america
our
plastic
arts
are
but
beginning
yesterday
we
were
preeminently
a
england
built
her
mediæval
cathedrals
but
they
left
no
legacy
among
craftsmen
art
had
to
lean
on
imported
favorites
like
van
dyck
till
the
days
of
sir
joshua
reynolds
and
the
founding
of
the
royal
society
consider
that
the
friends
of
reynolds
were
of
the
circle
of
doctor
johnson
literary
tradition
had
grown
old
then
england
had
her
beginning
of
landscape
gardening
later
she
saw
the
rise
of
constable
ruskin
and
turner
and
their
iridescent
successors
still
in
england
the
average
leading
citizen
matches
word
against
word
using
them
as
algebraic
formulas
rather
than
picture
against
picture
when
he
arranges
his
thoughts
under
the
eaves
of
his
mind
to
step
into
the
art
world
is
to
step
out
of
the
beaten
path
of
british
dreams
shakespeare
is
still
king
not
rossetti
nor
yet
christopher
wren
moreover
it
was
the
colonial
who
led
our
rebellion
against
the
very
royalty
that
founded
the
academy
the
american
wrote
the
declaration
of
independence
it
was
not
the
work
of
the
painting
or
englishman
we
were
led
by
patrick
henry
the
orator
benjamin
franklin
the
printer
the
more
characteristic
america
became
the
less
she
had
to
do
with
the
plastic
arts
the
carried
many
a
bible
and
dictionary
packed
in
beside
the
guns
and
axes
it
carried

elizabethan
writers
æsop
fables
blackstone
commentaries
the
revised
statutes
of
indiana
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
parson
weems
life
of
washington
but
obviously
there
was
no
place
for
the
elgin
marbles
giotto
tower
could
not
be
loaded
in
with
the
dried
apples
and
the
seedcorn
yesterday
morning
though
our
arts
were
growing
every
day
we
were
still
more
of
a
than
the
english
our
architectural
painting
and
sculptural
history
is
concerned
with
men
now
living
or
their
immediate
predecessors
and
even
such
work
as
we
have
is
pretty
largely
a
cult
by
the
wealthy
this
is
the
more
a
cause
for
misgiving
because
in
a
democracy
the
arts
like
the
political
parties
are
not
founded
till
they
have
touched
the
county
chairman
the
ward
leader
the
individual
voter
the
museums
in
a
democracy
should
go
as
far
as
the
public
libraries
every
town
has
its
library
there
are
not
twenty
art
museums
in
the
land
here
then
comes
the
romance
of
the
photoplay
a
tribe
that
has
thought
in
words
since
the
days
that
it
worshipped
thor
and
told
legends
of
the
cunning
of
the
tongue
of
loki
suddenly
begins
to
think
in
pictures
the
leaders
of
the
people
and
of
culture
scarcely
know
the
photoplay
exists
but
in
the
remote
villages
the
players
mentioned
in
this
work
are
as
well
known
and
as
fairly
understood
in
their
general
psychology
as
any
candidates
for
president
bearing
political
messages
there
is
many
a
babe
in
the
proletariat
not
over
four
years
old
who
has
received
more
pictures
into
its
eye
than
it
has
had
words
enter
its
ear
the
young
couple
go
with
their
and
it
sits
gaping
on
its
mother
knee
often
the
images
are
violent
and
unseemly
a
chaos
of
rawness
and
squirm
but
scattered
through
the
experience
is
a
delineation
of
the
world
pekin

harvard

become

by
the
time
the

it
has
travelled
indeed
almost
any
word
that
means
a
picture
in
the
text
of
the
geography
or
history
or
third
reader
is
apt
to
be
translated
unconsciously
into
moving
picture
terms
in
the
next
decade
simply
from
the
development
of
the
average
eye
cities
akin
to
the

now

the

will
respond
to
the
aspirations
of
these

as
the

it
not

thus
far
might
be
entitled
an
open

to

the
producers

actors
he
has
trained
contrary
to
my
prudent
inclinations
he
is
the
star

on
one
page
where
he
is
the
villain
this
stardom
came
about
slowly
in
making
the
final
revision
looking
up
the
producers
of
the
important
reels
especially
those
from
the
beginning
of
the
photoplay
business
numbers
of
times
the
photoplays
have
turned
out
to
be
the
work
of
this
former
leading
man
of
nance
no
one
can
pretend
to
a
full
knowledge
of
the
films
they
come
faster

in

it
would
take
a
man
every
day
of
the
year
working
day
and
night
to
see
all
that
come
to
springfield
but
in
the
photoplay
world
as
i
understand
it
griffith
is
the
so
far
in
this
work
i
have
endeavored
to
keep
to
the
established
dogmas
of
art
i
hope
that
the
main
lines
of
the
argument
will
appeal
to
the
people
who
have
classified
and
related
the
beautiful
works
of
man
that
have
preceded
the
moving
pictures
let
the
reader
make
his
own
essay
on
the
subject
for
the
local
papers
and
send
the
clipping
to
me
the
next
photoplay
book
that
may
appear
from
this

may
be
construed
to
meet
his
point
of
view
it
will
try
to
agree
or
disagree
in
clear

many
a

iii
more

not

so
dogmatically

i
climb
from

go
down

i
renounce

whatever
it

throw
it

battered
it
flickers
more
than
commonly
it
is
a
little
out
of
focus
the
house
is
not
built
for
it
the
owner
of
the
place
can
not
manage
an
art
gallery
with
a
circus
on
his
hands
it
takes
more
brains
than
one
man
possesses
to
pick
good
vaudeville
talent
and
bring
good
films
to
the
town
at
the
same
time
the
best
motion
picture
theatres
are
built
for
photoplays
alone
but
they
make
one
mistake
almost
every
motion
picture
theatre
has
its
orchestra
pianist
or
mechanical
piano
the
perfect
photoplay
would
have
no
sound
but
the
hum
of
the
conversing
audience
if
this
is
too
ruthless
a
theory
let
the
music
be
played
at
the
intervals
between
programmes
while
the
advertisements
are
being
flung
upon
the
screen
the
lights
are
on
and
the
people
coming
in
if
there
is
something
more
to
be
done
on
the
part
of
the
producer
to
make
the
film
a
telling
one
let
it
be
a
deeper
study
of
the
pictorial
arrangement
with
the
tones
more
carefully
balanced
the
sculpture
vitalized
this
is
certainly
better
than
to
have
a
raw
thing
bullied
through
with
a
furnished
to
bridge
the
weak
places
in
the
construction
a
picture
should
not
be
released
till
it
is
completely
thought
out
a
producer
with
this
goal
before
him
will
not
have
the
time
or
brains
to
spare
to
write
music
that
is
as
closely
and
delicately
related
to
the
action
as
the
action
is
to
the
background
and
unless
the
tunes
are
at
one
with
the
scheme
they
are
an
intrusion
perhaps
the
moving
picture
maker
has
a
twin
brother
almost
as
able
in
music
who
possesses
the
faculty
of
subordinating
his
creations
to
the
work
of
his
more
brilliant
coadjutor
how
are
they
going
to
make
a
practical
national
distribution
of
the
accompaniment
in
the
metropolitan
theatres
cabiria
carried
its
own
musicians
and
programme
with
a
rich
if
feverish
result
in
the
birth
of
a
nation
music
was
used
that
approached
imitative
sound
devices
also
the
orchestra
produced
a
substitute
for
stage
suspense
by
long
syncopations
the
finer
photoplay
values
were
thrown
askew
perhaps
these
two
performances
could
be
successfully
vindicated
in
musical
policy
but
such
a
defence
proves
nothing
in
regard
to
the
typical
film
imagine
either
of
these
put
on
in
rochester
illinois
population
one
hundred
souls
the
reels
run
through
as
well
as
on
broadway
or
michigan
avenue
but
the
local
orchestra
can
not
play
the
music
furnished
in
annotated
sheets
as
skilfully
as
the
local
operator
can
turn
the
reel
or
watch
the
motor
turn
it
the
big
social
fact
about
the
moving
picture
is
that
it
is
scattered
like
the
newspaper
any
normal
accompaniment
thereof
must
likewise
be
adapted
to
being
distributed
everywhere
the
present
writer
has
seen
here
in
his
home
place
population
sixty
thousand
all
the
films
discussed
in
this
book
but
cabiria
and
the
birth
of
a
nation
it
is
a
photoplay
paradise
the
spoken
theatre
is
practically
banished
unfortunately
the
local
moving
picture
managers
think
it
necessary
to
have
orchestras
the
musicians
they
can
secure
make
tunes
that
are
most
squalid
and
horrible
with
fathomless
imbecility
hoochey
koochey
strains
are
on
the
air
while
heroes
are
dying
the
miserere
is
in
our
ears
when
the
lovers
are
reconciled
ragtime
is
imposed
upon
us
while
the
old
mother
prays
for
her
lost
boy
sometimes
the
musician
with
this
variety
of
sympathy
abandons
himself
to
thrilling
improvisation
my
thoughts
on
this
subject
began
to
take
form
several
years
ago
when
the
film
this
book
has
much
praised
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
came
to
town
the
proprietor
of
one
theatre
put
in
front
of
his
shop
a
sign
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
by
harriet
beecher
stowe
brought
back
by
special
request
he
had
probably
read
julia
ward
howe
name
on
the
film
forty
times
before
the
sign
went
up
his
assistant
i
presume
his
daughter
played
in
the
shade
of
the
old
apple
tree
hour
after
hour
while
the
great
film
was
rolling
by
many
old
soldiers
were
coming
to
see
it
i
asked
the
assistant
why
she
did
not
play
and
sing
the
battle
hymn
she
said
they
just
could
find
it
are
the
distributors
willing
to
send
out
a
musician
with
each
film
many
of
the
springfield
producers
are
quite
able
and
enterprising
but
to
ask
for
music
with
photoplays
is
like
asking
the
man
at
the
news
stand
to
write
an
editorial
while
he
sells
you
the
paper
the
picture
with
a
great
orchestra
in
a
metropolitan
opera
house
may
be
classed
by
fanatic
partisanship
with
grand
opera
but
few
can
get
at
it
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
democracy
of
course
people
with
a
mechanical
imagination
and
no
other
kind
begin
to
suggest
the
talking
moving
picture
at
this
point
or
the
phonograph
or
the
mechanical
piano
let
us
discuss
the
talking
moving
picture
only
that
disposes
of
the
others
if
the
talking
moving
picture
becomes
a
reliable
mirror
of
the
human
voice
and
frame
it
will
be
the
basis
of
such
a
separate
art
that
none
of
the
photoplay
precedents
will
apply
it
will
be
the
not
the
photoplay
it
will
be
unpleasant
for
a
long
time
this
book
is
a
struggle
against
the
of
the
undisciplined
photograph
any
film
is
correct
realistic
forceful
many
times
before
it
is
charming
the
actual
physical
of
the
actor
is
many
hundred
miles
away
as
a
substitute
the
human
quality
must
come
in
the
marks
of
the
presence
of
the
producer
the
entire
painting
must
have
his
brushwork
if
we
compare
it
to
a
it
must
be
in
his
handwriting
rather
than
worked
on
a
typewriter
if
he
puts
his
autograph
into
the
film
it
is
after
a
fierce
struggle
with
the
uncanny
scientific
quality
of
the
camera
work
his
genius
and
that
of
the
whole
company
of
actors
is
exhausted
in
the
task
the
raw
phonograph
is
likewise
unmagnetic
would
you
set
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
troupe
of
actors
the
additional
responsibility
of
putting
an
adequate
substitute
for
human
magnetism
in
the
phonographic
disk
the
voice
that
does
not
actually
bleed
that
contains
no
fails
to
meet
the
emergency
few
people
have
wept
over
a
phonographic
selection
from
tristan
and
isolde
they
are
moved
at
the
actual
performance
why
look
at
the
opera
singer
after
the
last
act
his
eyes
are
burning
his
face
is
flushed
his
pulse
is
high
reaching
his
hotel
room
he
is
far
more
weary
than
if
he
had
sung
the
opera
alone
there
he
has
given
out
of
his
and
the
same
magnetism
that
leads
men
in
battle
to
speak
of
it
in
the
crassest
terms
this
resource
brings
him
a
hundred
times
more
salary
than
another
man
with
just
as
good
a
voice
can
command
the
output
that
leaves
him
drained
at
the
end
of
the
show
can
not
be
stored
in
the
phonograph
machine
that
device
is
as
good
in
the
morning
as
at
noon
it
ticks
like
a
clock
to
perfect
the
talking
moving
picture
human
magnetism
must
be
put
into
the
and
into
the
clock
not
only
is
this
imperative
but
clock
and
mirror
must
be
harmonized
one
gently
subordinated
to
the
other
both
can
not
rule
in
the
present
talking
moving
picture
the
more
highly
developed
photoplay
is
dragged
by
the
hair
in
a
dead
faint
in
the
wake
of
the
screaming
savage
phonograph
no
talking
machine
on
the
market
reproduces
conversation
clearly
unless
it
be
elaborately
articulated
in
unnatural
tones
with
a
stiff
interval
between
each
question
and
answer
real
dialogue
goes
to
ruin
the
talking
moving
picture
came
to
our
town
we
were
given
for
one
show
a
line
of
minstrels
facing
the
audience
with
the
interlocutor
repeating
his
immemorial
question
and
the
giving
the
immemorial
answer
then
came
a
scene
in
a
blacksmith
shop
where
certain
rackets
were
carried
over
the
footlights
no
one
heard
the
blacksmith
unless
he
stopped
to
shout
straight
at
us
the
can
quite
possibly
reach
some
divine
goal
but
it
will
be
after
the
speaking
powers
of
the
phonograph
excel
the
photographing
powers
of
the
reel
and
then
the
pictures
will
be
brought
in
as
comment
and
ornament
to
the
speech
the
pictures
will
be
held
back
by
the
phonograph
as
long
as
it
is
more
limited
in
its
range
the
pictures
are
at
present
freer
and
more
versatile
without
it
if
the
is
ever
established
since
it
will
double
the
machinery
it
must
needs
double
its
prices
it
will
be
the
illustrated
phonograph
in
a
more
expensive
theatre
the
orchestra
is
in
part
a
blundering
effort
by
the
local
manager
to
supply
the
element
which
he
feels
lacking
in
the
pictures
on
which
the
producer
has
not
left
his
autograph
but
there
is
a
much
more
economic
and
magnetic
accompaniment
the
buzzing
commentary
of
the
audience
there
will
be
some
people
who
disturb
the
neighbors
in
front
but
the
average
crowd
has
developed
its
manners
in
this
particular
and
when
the
orchestra
is
silent
murmurs
like
a
pleasant
brook
local
manager
why
not
an
advertising
campaign
in
your
town
that
says
beginning
monday
and
henceforth
ours
shall
be
known
as
the
conversational
theatre
at
the
door
let
each
person
be
handed
the
following
card
you
are
encouraged
to
discuss
the
picture
with
the
friend
who
accompanies
you
to
this
place
conversation
of
course
must
be
sufficiently
subdued
not
to
disturb
the
stranger
who
did
not
come
with
you
to
the
theatre
if
you
are
so
disposed
consider
your
answers
to
these
questions
what
play
or
part
of
a
play
given
in
this
theatre
did
you
like
most
what
the
least
what
is
the
best
picture
you
have
ever
seen
anywhere
what
pictures
seen
here
this
month
shall
we
bring
back
here
give
a
list
of
the
recent
productions
with
squares
to
mark
by
the
australian
ballot
system
approved
or
disapproved
the
cards
with
their
answers
could
be
slipped
into
the
at
the
door
as
the
crowd
goes
out
it
may
be
these
questions
are
for
the
exceptional
audiences
in
residence
districts
perhaps
with
most
crowds
the
last
interrogation
is
the
only
one
worth
while
but
by
gathering
habitually
the
answers
to
that
alone
the
place
would
get
the
drift
of
its
public
realize
its
genius
and
become
an
the
people
bestowing
the
blue
ribbons
the
photoplay
theatres
have
coupon
contests
and
balloting
already
the
most
popular
young
lady
money
prizes
to
the
best
in
the
audience
etc
why
not
ballot
on
the
matter
in
hand
if
the
cards
are
sent
out
by
the
big
producers
a
referendum
could
be
secured
that
would
be
invaluable
in
arguing
down
to
rigid
censorship
and
enable
them
to
make
their
own
private
censorship
more
intelligent
various
styles
of
experimental
cards
could
be
tried
till
the
vital
one
is
found
there
is
growing
up
in
this
country
a
clan
of
moving
picture
critics
the
present
stage
of
their
work
is
indicated
by
the
eloquent
notice
describing
your
girl
and
mine
in
the
chapter
on
progress
and
endowment
the
metropolitan
papers
give
their
photoplay
reporters
as
much
space
as
the
theatrical
critics
here
in
my
home
town
the
twelve
moving
picture
places
take
one
half
a
page
of
chaotic
notices
daily
the
country
is
being
badly
led
by
professional
photoplay
who
do
not
know
where
they
are
going
but
are
on
the
way
but
they
aptly
describe
the
habitual
attendants
as
moving
picture
fans
the
fan
at
the
photoplay
as
at
the
baseball
grounds
is
neither
a
nor
a
he
is
an
enthusiast
who
is
as
stirred
by
the
charge
of
the
photographic
cavalry
as
by
the
home
runs
that
he
watches
from
the
bleachers
in
both
places
he
has
the
privilege
of
comment
while
the
game
goes
on
in
the
photoplay
theatre
it
is
not
so
vociferous
but
as
keenly
felt
each
person
roots
by
himself
he
has
his
own
judgment
and
roasts
the
umpire
who
is
the
keeper
of
the
local
theatre
or
the
producer
as
the
case
may
be
if
these
opinions
of
the
fan
can
be
collected
and
classified
an
informal
censorship
is
at
once
established
the
photoplay
reporters
can
then
take
the
enthusiasts
in
hand
and
lead
them
to
a
realization
of
the
finer
points
in
awarding
praise
and
blame
even
the
sporting
pages
have
their
expert
opinions
with
due
influence
on
the
betting
odds
out
of
the
work
of
the
photoplay
reporters
let
a
superstructure
of
art
criticism
be
reared
in
periodicals
like
the
century
harper
scribner
the
atlantic
the
craftsman
and
the
architectural
magazines
these
are
our
natural
custodians
of
art
they
should
reproduce
the
most
exquisite
tableaus
and
be
as
fastidious
in
their
selection
of
them
as
they
are
in
the
current
examples
of
the
other
arts
let
them
spread
the
news
when
photoplays
keyed
to
the
rembrandt
mood
arrive
the
reporters
for
the
newspapers
should
get
their
ideas
and
refreshment
in
such
places
as
the
ryerson
art
library
of
the
chicago
art
institute
they
should
begin
with
such
books
as
richard
muther
history
of
modern
painting
john
van
dyke
art
for
art
sake
marquand
and
frothingham
history
of
sculpture
hamlin
history
of
architecture
they
should
take
the
business
of
guidance
in
this
new
world
as
a
sacred
trust
knowing
they
have
the
power
to
influence
an
enormous
democracy
the
moving
picture
journals
and
the
literati
are
in
straits
over
the
censorship
question
the
literati
side
with
the
managers
on
the
principles
of
free
speech
and
a
free
press
but
few
of
the
æsthetically
are
persistent
fans
they
rave
for
freedom
but
are
not
as
a
general
thing
living
back
in
the
home
town
they
do
not
face
the
exigency
of
having
their
summer
and
winter
amusement
spoiled
day
after
day
extremists
among
the
pious
are
railing
against
the
moving
pictures
as
once
they
railed
against
novels
they
have
no
notion
that
this
institution
is
penetrating
to
the
last
backwoods
of
our
civilization
where
its
presence
is
as
hard
to
prevent
as
the
rain
but
some
of
us
are
destined
to
a
reaction
almost
as
strong
as
the
obsession
the
religionists
will
think
they
lead
it
they
will
be
moving
picture
nausea
is
already
taking
hold
of
numberless
people
even
when
they
are
in
the
purely
pagan
mood
forced
by
their
limited
purses
their
inability
to
buy
a
ford
car
and
the
like
they
go
in
their
loneliness
to
film
after
film
till
the
whole
world
seems
to
turn
on
a
reel
when
they
are
again
at
home
they
see
in
the
dark
an
imaginary
screen
with
tremendous
pictures
whirling
by
at
a
horribly
accelerated
pace
a
photoplay
delirium
tremens
faster
and
faster
the
reel
turns
in
the
back
of
their
heads
when
the
moving
picture
is
upon
one
nothing
satisfies
but
the
quietest
out
of
doors
the
companionship
of
the
gentlest
of
real
people
the
has
charms
such
as
one
never
before
conceived
the
worn
citizen
feels
that
the
cranks
and
legislators
can
do
what
they
please
to
the
producers
he
is
through
with
them
the
moving
picture
business
men
do
not
realize
that
they
have
to
face
these
nervous
conditions
in
their
erstwhile
friends
they
flatter
themselves
they
are
being
pursued
by
some
reincarnations
of
anthony
comstock
there
are
several
reasons
why
photoplay
corporations
are
callous
along
with
the
sufficient
one
that
they
are
corporations
first
they
are
engaged
in
a
financial
orgy
fortunes
are
being
found
by
actors
and
managers
faster
than
they
were
dug
up
in
and
in
california
lawlessness
of
soul
prevails
they
talk
each
other
into
a
lordly
state
of
mind
all
is
dash
and
experiment
look
at
the
advertisements
in
the
leading
moving
picture
magazines
they
are
like
the
praise
of
oil
stock
or
peruna
they
bawl
about
films
founded
upon
little
classics
they
howl
about
plots
that
are
ostensibly
from
the
soberest
of
novels
whose
authors
they
blasphemously
invoke
they
boo
and
blow
about
twisted
callous
scenarios
that
are
bad
imitations
of
the
world
most
beloved
lyrics
the
producers
do
not
realize
the
mass
effect
of
the
output
of
the
business
it
appears
to
many
as
a
sea
of
unharnessed
photography
sloppy
conceptions
set
forth
with
sharp
edges
and
irrelevant
realism
the
jumping
twitching
devices
day
after
day
create
the
aforesaid
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
questionable
subject
when
on
top
of
this
we
come
to
the
picture
that
is
actually
insulting
we
are
up
in
arms
indeed
it
is
supplied
by
a
corporation
magnate
removed
from
his
audience
in
location
fortune
interest
and
mood
an
absentee
landlord
i
was
trying
to
convert
a
talented
and
noble
friend
to
the
films
the
first
time
we
went
there
was
a
between
a
black
and
a
white
man
not
advertised
used
for
a
filler
i
said
it
was
queer
and
would
not
happen
again
the
next
time
my
noble
friend
was
persuaded
to
go
there
was
a
incidental
to
a
cuban
romance
the
third
visit
we
beheld
a
lady
who
was
dying
for
five
minutes
rolling
her
eyes
about
in
a
way
that
was
fearful
to
see
the
convert
was
not
made
it
is
too
easy
to
produce
an
unprovoked
murder
an
inexplicable
arson
neither
led
up
to
nor
followed
by
the
ordinary
human
history
of
such
acts
and
therefore
as
arbitrary
as
the
deeds
of
idiots
or
the
insane
a
villainous
hate
an
alleged
love
a
violent
death
are
flashed
at
us
without
being
in
any
sort
of
tableau
logic
the
public
is
ceaselessly
played
upon
by
tactless
devices
therefore
it
howls
just
as
children
in
the
nursery
do
when
the
awkward
governess
tries
the
very
thing
the
diplomatic
governess
in
reasonable
time
may
bring
about
the
producer
has
the
man
in
the
audience
who
cares
for
the
art
peculiarly
at
his
mercy
compare
him
with
the
person
who
wants
to
read
a
magazine
for
an
evening
he
can
look
over
all
the
periodicals
in
the
local
in
fifteen
minutes
he
can
select
the
one
he
wants
take
this
bit
of
printed
matter
home
go
through
the
contents
find
the
three
articles
he
prefers
get
an
evening
of
reading
out
of
them
and
be
happy
every
day
as
many
photoplays
come
to
our
town
as
magazines
come
to
the
in
a
week
or
a
month
there
are
good
ones
and
bad
ones
buried
in
the
list
there
is
no
way
to
sample
the
films
one
has
to
wait
through
the
first
third
of
a
reel
before
he
has
an
idea
of
the
merits
of
a
production
his
ten
cents
is
spent
and
much
of
his
time
is
gone
it
would
take
five
hours
at
least
to
find
the
best
film
in
our
town
for
one
day
meanwhile
nibbling
and
sampling
the
seeker
would
run
such
a
gantlet
of
plot
and
dash
and
chase
that
his
eyes
and
patience
would
be
exhausted
recently
there
returned
to
the
city
for
a
day
one
of
griffith
best
biographs
the
last
drop
of
water
it
was
good
to
see
again
in
order
to
watch
this
one
reel
twice
i
had
to
wait
through
five
others
of
unutterable
miscellany
since
the
producers
and
have
us
at
their
mercy
they
are
under
every
obligation
to
consider
our
delicate
susceptibilities
granting
the
proposition
that
in
an
ideal
world
we
will
have
no
legal
censorship
as
to
what
to
do
in
this
actual
nation
let
the
reader
follow
what
john
collier
has
recently
written
in
the
survey
collier
was
the
leading
force
in
founding
the
national
board
of
censorship
as
a
member
of
that
volunteer
board
which
is
independent
and
high
minded
yet
accepted
by
the
leading
picture
companies
he
is
able
to
discuss
legislation
in
a
manner
which
the
present
writer
can
not
hope
to
match
read
john
collier
but
i
wish
to
suggest
that
the
ideal
censorship
is
that
to
which
the
daily
press
is
subject
the
elastic
hand
of
public
opinion
if
the
photoplay
can
be
brought
as
near
to
newspaper
conditions
in
this
matter
as
it
is
in
some
others
how
does
public
opinion
grip
the
journalist
the
editor
has
a
constant
report
from
his
constituency
a
popular
scoop
sells
an
extra
at
once
an
attack
on
the
wrong
idol
cancels
fifty
subscriptions
people
come
to
the
office
to
do
it
and
say
why
if
there
is
a
piece
of
real
news
on
the
second
page
and
fifty
letters
come
in
about
it
that
night
next
month
when
that
character
of
news
reappears
it
gets
the
front
page
some
human
peculiarities
are
not
mentioned
some
phrases
not
used
the
total
attribute
of
the
man
is
diplomacy
but
while
the
motion
pictures
come
out
every
day
they
get
their
discipline
months
afterwards
in
the
legislation
that
insists
on
everything
but
tact
a
tentative
substitute
for
the
letters
that
come
to
the
editor
the
personal
call
and
cancelled
subscription
and
the
rest
is
the
system
of
balloting
on
the
picture
especially
the
answer
to
the
question
what
picture
seen
here
this
month
or
this
week
shall
we
bring
back
experience
will
teach
how
to
put
the
queries
by
the
same
system
the
public
might
dictate
its
own
let
us
have
a
democracy
and
a
photoplay
business
working
in
daily
rhythm
chapter
xv
the
substitute
for
the
saloon
this
is
a
special
commentary
on
chapter
five
the
picture
of
crowd
splendor
it
refers
as
well
to
every
other
type
of
moving
picture
that
gets
into
the
slum
but
the
masses
have
an
extraordinary
affinity
for
the
crowd
photoplay
as
has
been
said
before
the
mob
comes
nightly
to
behold
its
natural
face
in
the
glass
politicians
on
the
platform
have
swayed
the
mass
below
them
but
now
to
speak
in
an
irish
way
the
crowd
takes
the
platform
and
looking
down
sees
itself
swaying
the
slums
are
an
astonishing
assembly
of
crawling
out
of
their
shelters
to
exhibit
for
the
first
time
in
history
a
common
interest
on
a
tremendous
scale
in
an
art
form
below
the
cliff
caves
were
bar
rooms
in
endless
lines
there
are
almost
as
many
bar
rooms
yet
this
new
thing
breaks
the
lines
as
nothing
else
ever
did
often
when
a
moving
picture
house
is
set
up
the
saloon
on
the
right
hand
or
the
left
declares
bankruptcy
why
do
men
prefer
the
photoplay
to
the
drinking
place
for
no
pious
reason
surely
now
they
have
fire
pouring
into
their
eyes
instead
of
into
their
bellies
blood
is
drawn
from
the
guts
to
the
brain
though
the
picture
be
the
veriest
mess
the
light
and
movement
cause
the
beholder
to
do
a
little
reptilian
thinking
after
a
day
work
a
enters
the
place
heavy
as
king
log
a
goes
in
sick
and
surly
it
is
the
state
of
the
body
when
many
men
drink
themselves
into
insensibility
but
here
the
light
is
as
strong
in
the
eye
as
whiskey
in
the
throat
along
with
the
flare
shadow
and
mystery
they
face
the
existence
of
people
places
costumes
utterly
novel
immigrants
are
prodded
by
these
swords
of
darkness
and
light
to
guess
at
the
meaning
of
the
and
headlines
that
punctuate
the
play
they
strain
to
hear
their
neighbors
whisper
or
spell
them
out
the
photoplays
have
done
something
to
reunite
the
families
no
longer
is
the
the
only
summer
resort
for
big
and
little
folks
here
is
more
fancy
and
whim
than
ever
before
blessed
a
hot
night
here
under
the
wind
of
an
electric
fan
they
witness
everything
from
a
burial
in
westminster
to
the
birthday
parade
of
the
ruler
of
the
land
of
swat
the
usual
saloon
equipment
to
delight
the
eye
is
one
leg
picture
of
a
woman
a
photograph
of
a
and
some
colored
portraits
of
goats
to
advertise
various
brands
of
beer
many
times
no
doubt
these
boys
and
young
men
have
found
visions
of
a
sordid
kind
while
gazing
on
the
actress
the
fighter
or
the
goats
but
what
poor
material
they
had
in
the
wardrobes
of
memory
for
the
trimmings
and
habiliments
of
vision
to
make
this
lady
into
freya
this
into
thor
these
goats
into
the
harnessed
steeds
that
drew
his
chariot
man
dreams
are
rearranged
and
glorified
memories
how
could
these
people
reconstruct
the
torn
carpets
and
tin
cans
and
of
their
lives
into
mythology
how
could
memories
of
ladies
entrance
squalor
be
made
into
castles
in
granada
or
carcassonne
the
things
they
drank
to
see
and
saw
but
grotesquely
and
paid
for
terribly
now
roll
before
them
with
no
after
pain
or
punishment
the
mumbled
conversation
the
sociability
for
which
they
leaned
over
the
tables
they
have
here
in
the
same
manner
with
far
more
to
talk
about
they
come
they
go
home
men
and
women
together
as
casually
and
impulsively
as
the
men
alone
ever
entered
a
but
discoursing
now
of
mountains
and
lovers
as
padraic
colum
says
in
his
poem
on
the
herdsman
with
thoughts
on
white
ships
and
the
king
of
spain
daughter
this
is
why
the
saloon
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
in
the
slum
is
apt
to
move
out
when
the
photoplay
moves
in
but
let
us
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
temperance
argument
i
beg
to
be
allowed
to
relate
a
personal
matter
for
some
time
i
was
a
for
the
league
of
illinois
being
sent
every
sunday
to
a
new
region
to
make
the
yearly
visit
on
behalf
of
the
league
such
a
visitor
is
apt
to
speak
to
one
church
in
a
village
and
two
in
the
country
on
each
excursion
being
met
at
the
station
by
some
leading
of
the
section
and
driven
to
these
points
by
him
the
talk
with
this
man
was
worth
it
all
to
me
the
agricultural
territory
of
the
united
states
is
naturally
dry
this
is
because
the
church
is
the
only
communal
institution
and
the
voice
of
the
pastor
is
for
teetotalism
the
routine
of
the
while
by
no
means
ideal
in
other
respects
keeps
him
from
craving
drink
as
intensely
as
other
toilers
do
a
day
work
in
the
open
air
fills
his
veins
at
nightfall
with
an
opiate
of
weariness
instead
of
a
nervousness
the
strong
men
of
the
community
are
church
elders
not
through
fanaticism
but
by
right
of
leadership
through
their
office
they
are
committed
to
prohibition
so
opposition
to
the
temperance
movement
is
scattering
the
league
has
organized
these
leaders
into
a
machine
it
sees
that
they
get
their
weekly
paper
instructing
them
in
the
tactics
whereby
local
fights
have
been
won
a
subscription
financing
the
state
league
is
taken
once
a
year
it
counts
on
the
regular
list
of
church
benevolences
the
state
officers
come
in
to
help
on
the
critical
local
fights
any
country
politician
fears
their
denunciation
as
he
does
political
death
the
local
machines
thus
backed
are
incurable
mugwumps
hold
the
balance
of
power
work
in
both
parties
and
have
voted
dry
the
agricultural
territory
of
the
united
states
everywhere
by
the
township
county
or
state
unit
the
only
institutions
that
touch
the
same
territory
in
a
similar
way
are
the
chautauquas
in
the
prosperous
agricultural
centres
these
too
by
the
same
sign
are
emphatically
in
their
propaganda
serving
to
intellectualize
and
secularize
the
dry
sentiment
without
taking
it
out
of
the
agricultural
caste
there
is
a
definite
line
between
our
and
the
rest
when
a
county
goes
dry
it
is
generally
in
spite
of
the
such
temperance
people
as
are
in
the
town
represent
the
which
is
even
then
in
goodly
proportion
a
vote
the
larger
the
the
larger
the
population
and
the
more
stubborn
the
fight
the
majority
of
miners
and
factory
workers
are
on
the
wet
side
everywhere
the
irritation
caused
by
the
gases
in
the
mines
by
the
dirty
work
in
the
blackness
by
the
squalor
in
which
the
company
houses
are
built
turns
men
to
drink
for
reaction
and
lamplight
and
comradeship
the
similar
fevers
and
exasperations
of
factory
life
lead
the
workers
to
unstring
their
tense
nerves
with
liquor
the
habit
of
snuggling
up
close
in
factories
conversing
often
bench
by
bench
machine
by
machine
inclines
them
to
get
together
for
their
pleasures
at
the
bar
in
industrial
america
there
is
an
minority
in
moral
sympathy
with
the
temperance
wave
brought
in
by
the
farmers
but
they
are
outstanding
groups
their
leadership
seldom
dries
up
a
factory
town
or
a
mining
region
with
all
the
help
the
league
can
give
in
the
big
cities
the
temperance
movement
is
scarcely
understood
the
choice
residential
districts
are
voted
dry
for
real
estate
reasons
the
men
who
do
this
drink
freely
at
their
own
clubs
or
parties
the
temperance
question
would
be
fruitlessly
argued
to
the
end
of
time
were
it
not
for
the
massive
agricultural
vote
rolling
and
roaring
round
each
metropolis
reawakening
the
town
churches
whose
vote
is
a
pitiful
minority
but
whose
spokesmen
are
occasionally
strident
there
is
a
prophecy
abroad
that
prohibition
will
be
the
issue
of
a
national
election
if
the
question
is
squarely
put
there
are
enough
farmers
and
to
drive
the
saloon
out
of
legal
existence
the
women
vote
a
little
more
puritanical
than
the
men
vote
will
make
the
result
sure
as
one
anxious
for
this
victory
i
have
often
speculated
on
the
situation
when
all
america
is
nominally
dry
at
the
behest
of
the
american
farmer
the
american
preacher
and
the
american
woman
when
the
use
of
alcohol
is
treason
what
will
become
of
those
all
but
unbroken
lines
of
slum
saloons
no
lesser
force
than
regular
troops
could
dislodge
them
with
yesterday
intrenchment
the
entrance
of
the
motion
picture
house
into
the
arena
is
indeed
striking
the
first
enemy
of
king
alcohol
with
real
power
where
that
king
has
deepest
hold
if
every
one
of
those
saloon
doors
is
nailed
up
by
the
chautauqua
orators
the
photoplay
archway
will
remain
open
the
people
will
have
a
shelter
where
they
can
readjust
themselves
that
offers
a
substitute
for
many
of
the
lines
of
pleasure
in
the
groggery
and
a
whole
evening
costs
but
a
dime
apiece
several
rounds
of
drinks
are
expensive
but
the
people
can
sit
through
as
many
repetitions
of
this
programme
as
they
desire
for
one
entrance
fee
the
dominant
genius
of
the
moving
picture
place
is
not
a
gentleman
with
a
red
nose
and
an
eye
like
a
dead
fish
but
some
producer
who
with
all
his
faults
has
given
every
person
in
the
audience
a
telescope
since
i
have
announced
myself
a
farmer
and
a
puritan
let
me
here
list
the
saloon
evils
not
yet
recorded
in
this
chapter
they
are
separate
from
the
catalogue
of
the
individualistic
woes
of
the
drunkard
that
are
given
in
the
scripture
the
shame
of
the
american
drinking
place
is
the
who
dominates
its
thinking
his
cynical
and
hardened
soul
wipes
out
a
portion
of
the
influence
of
the
public
school
the
library
the
newspaper
a
stream
rises
no
higher
than
its
source
and
through
his
eye
and
brain
the
group
of
tired
men
look
upon
all
the
statesmen
and
wise
ones
of
the
land
though
he
says
worse
than
nothing
his
furry
tongue
by
endless
reiteration
is
the
american
slum
oracle
at
the
present
the
handles
the
neighborhood
group
the
ultimate
unit
in
city
politics
so
good
citizen
welcome
the
coming
of
the
moving
picture
man
as
a
local
social
force
whatever
his
private
character
the
mere
formula
of
his
activities
makes
him
a
better
type
he
may
not
at
first
sway
his
group
in
a
directly
political
way
but
he
will
make
himself
the
centre
of
more
social
ideals
than
the
ever
entertained
and
he
is
beginning
to
have
as
intimate
a
relation
to
his
public
as
the
in
many
cases
he
stands
under
his
arch
in
the
sheltered
lobby
and
is
on
conversing
terms
with
his
habitual
customers
the
length
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
voting
the
saloon
out
of
the
slums
by
voting
america
dry
does
not
as
of
old
promise
to
be
a
successful
operation
that
kills
the
patient
in
the
past
some
of
the
photoplay
magazines
have
contained
denunciations
of
the
temperance
people
for
refusing
to
say
anything
in
behalf
of
the
greatest
practical
enemy
of
the
saloon
but
it
is
not
too
late
for
the

california
and
america
the
moving
picture
captains
of
industry
like
the
california
gold
finders
of
making
colossal
fortunes
in
two
or
three
years
have
the
same
glorious
irresponsibility
and
occasional
need
of
the
sheriff
they
are
californians
more
literally
than
this
around
los
angeles
the
greatest
and
most
characteristic
moving
picture
colonies
are
being
built
each
photoplay
magazine
has
its
california
letter
telling
of
the
of
new
studios
and
the
transfer
of
actors
with
much
personal
gossip
this
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
fact
that
every
type
of
the
photoplay
but
the
intimate
is
founded
on
some
phase
of
the
being
thus
dependent
the
plant
can
best
be
set
up
where
there
is
no
winter
besides
this
the
los
angeles
region
has
the
sea
the
mountains
the
desert
and
many
kinds
of
grove
and
field
landscape
and
architecture
are
but
for
a
description
of
california
ask
any
traveller
or
study
the
background
of
almost
any
photoplay
if
the
photoplay
is
the
consistent
utterance
of
its
scenes
if
the
actors
are
incarnations
of
the
land
they
walk
upon
as
they
should
be
california
indeed
stands
a
chance
to
achieve
through
the
films
an
utterance
of
her
own
will
this
land
furthest
west
be
the
first
to
capture
the
inner
spirit
of
this
newest
and
most
curious
of
the
arts
it
certainly
has
the
opportunity
that
comes
with
the
actors
producers
and
equipment
let
us
hope
that
every
region
will
develop
the
silent
photographic
pageant
in
a
local
form
as
outlined
in
the
chapter
on
progress
and
endowment
already
the
california
sort
in
the
commercial
channels
has
become
the
broadly
accepted
if
mediocre
national
form
people
who
revere
the
pilgrim
fathers
of
have
often
wished
those
gentlemen
had
moored
their
bark
in
the
region
of
los
angeles
rather
than
plymouth
rock
that
boston
had
been
founded
there
at
last
that
landing
is
achieved
patriotic
art
students
have
discussed
with
mingled
irony
and
admiration
the
boston
domination
of
the
only
american
culture
of
the
nineteenth
century
namely
literature
indianapolis
has
had
her
day
since
then
chicago
is
lifting
her
head
nevertheless
boston
still
controls
the
in
english
and
dominates
our
high
schools
ironic
feelings
in
this
matter
on
the
part
of
western
men
are
based
somewhat
on
envy
and
illegitimate
cussedness
but
are
also
grounded
in
the
honest
hope
of
a
healthful
rivalry
they
want
new
romanticists
and
artists
as
indigenous
to
their
soil
as
was
hawthorne
to
salem
or
longfellow
to
the
chestnuts
of
his
native
heath
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
patriarchs
from
oliver
wendell
holmes
to
amos
bronson
alcott
they
were
true
sons
of
the
new
england
stone
fences
and
meeting
houses
they
could
not
have
been
born
or
nurtured
anywhere
else
on
the
face
of
the
earth
some
of
us
view
with
a
peculiar
thrill
the
prospect
that
los
angeles
may
become
the
boston
of
the
photoplay
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
the
florence
because
california
reminds
one
of
colorful
italy
more
than
of
any
part
of
the
united
states
yet
there
is
a
difference
the
californian
has
an
obvious
magnificence
about
him
that
is
allied
to
the
eucalyptus
tree
the
pomegranate
california
is
a
gilded
state
it
has
not
the
sordidness
of
gold
as
has
wall
street
but
it
is
the
embodiment
of
the
natural
ore
that
the
ragged
prospector
finds
the
gold
of
california
is
the
color
of
the
orange
the
glitter
of
dawn
in
the
yosemite
the
hue
of
the
golden
gate
that
opens
the
sunset
way
to
mystic
and
terrible
cathay
and
hindustan
the
enemy
of
california
says
the
state
is
magnificent
but
thin
he
declares
it
is
as
though
it
were
painted
on
a
brobdingnagian
piece
of
gilt
paper
and
he
who
dampens
his
finger
and
thrusts
it
through
finds
an
alkali
valley
on
the
other
side
the
lonely
prickly
pear
and
a
heap
of
ashes
from
a
deserted
he
says
the
citizens
of
this
state
lack
the
richness
of
an
æsthetic
and
religious
tradition
he
says
there
is
no
substitute
for
time
but
even
these
things
make
for
coincidence
this
apparent
thinness
california
has
in
common
with
the
routine
photoplay
which
is
at
times
as
shallow
in
its
thought
as
the
shadow
it
throws
upon
the
screen
this
newness
california
has
in
common
with
all
photoplays
it
is
thrillingly
possible
for
the
state
and
the
art
to
acquire
spiritual
tradition
and
depth
together
part
of
the
thinness
of
california
is
not
only
its
youth
but
the
result
of
the
physical
fact
that
the
human
race
is
there
spread
over
so
many
acres
of
land
they
try
not
only
to
count
their
mines
and
enumerate
their
palm
trees
but
they
count
the
miles
of
their
and
the
acres
under
cultivation
and
the
height
of
the
peaks
and
revel
in
large
statistics
and
the
bigness
generally
and
forget
how
a
few
men
rattle
around
in
a
great
deal
of
scenery
they
shout
their
statistics
across
the
rockies
and
the
deserts
to
new
york
the
mississippi
valley
is
to
the
californian
his
is
for
the
opposite
through
the
geographical
accident
of
separation
by
mountain
and
desert
from
the
rest
of
the
country
he
becomes
a
mere
shouter
hurrahing
so
assiduously
that
all
variety
in
the
voice
is
lost
then
he
tries
gestures
and
becomes
flamboyant
rococo
these
are
the
defects
of
the
motion
picture
qualities
also
its
panoramic
tendency
runs
wild
as
an
institution
it
advertises
itself
with
the
sweeping
gesture
it
has
the
same
passion
for
these
are
not
the
sins
of
new
england
when
in
the
hands
of
masters
they
become
sources
of
strength
they
will
be
a
different
set
of
virtues
from
those
of
new
england
there
is
no
more
natural
place
for
the
scattering
of
confetti
than
this
state
except
the
moving
picture
scene
itself
both
have
a
genius
for
gardens
and
dancing
and
carnival
when
the
californian
relegates
the
dramatic
to
secondary
scenes
both
in
his
life
and
his
photoplay
and
turns
to
the
genuinely
epic
and
lyric
he
and
this
instrument
may
find
their
immortality
together
as
new
england
found
its
soul
in
the
essays
of
emerson
tide
upon
tide
of
spring
comes
into
california
through
all
four
seasons
fairy
beauty
overwhelms
the
lumbering
players
the
tiniest
garden
is
a
jewelled
pathway
of
wonder
but
the
californian
can
not
shout
orange
blossoms
orange
blossoms
heliotrope
heliotrope
he
can
not
boom
forth
roseleaves
roseleaves
so
that
he
does
their
beauties
justice
here
is
where
the
photoplay
can
begin
to
give
him
a
more
delicate
utterance
and
he
can
go
on
into
stranger
things
and
evolve
all
the
splendor
films
into
higher
types
for
the
very
name
of
california
is
splendor
the
california
can
base
his
crowd
picture
upon
the
mobs
of
san
francisco
he
can
derive
his
patriotic
and
religious
splendors
from
something
older
and
more
magnificent
than
the
aisles
of
the
romanesque
namely
the
groves
of
the
giant
redwoods
the
campaign
for
a
beautiful
nation
could
very
well
emanate
from
the
west
coast
where
with
the
slightest
care
grow
up
models
for
all
the
world
of
plant
arrangement
and
our
mechanical
east
is
reproved
our
tension
is
relaxed
our
ugliness
is
challenged
every
time
we
look
upon
those
garden
paths
and
forests
it
is
possible
for
los
angeles
to
lay
hold
of
the
motion
picture
as
our
national
in
art
as
boston
appropriated
to
herself
the
guardianship
of
the
national
of
literature
if
california
has
a
shining
soul
and
not
merely
a
golden
body
let
her
forget
her
melodramatics
and
turn
to
her
poets
who
understand
the
heart
underneath
the
glory
edwin
markham
the
dean
of
american
singers
clark
ashton
smith
the
young
star
treader
george
sterling
that
son
of
ancient
merlin
have
in
their
songs
the
seeds
of
better
scenarios
than
california
has
sent
us
there
are
two
poems
by
george
sterling
that
i
have
had
in
mind
for
many
a
day
as
conceptions
that
should
inspire
mystic
films
akin
to
them
these
poems
are
the
night
sentries
and
tidal
king
of
nations
but
california
can
tell
us
stories
that
are
grim
children
of
the
tales
of
the
wild
ambrose
bierce
then
there
is
the
lovely
unforgotten
nora
may
french
and
the
austere
edward
rowland
sill
edison
is
the
new
gutenberg
he
has
invented
the
new

the
state
that
realizes
this
may
lead
the
soul
of
america
day
after
chapter
xvii
progress
and

the
moving
picture
goes
almost
as
far
as
journalism
into
the
social
fabric
in
some
ways
further
in
others
soon
no
doubt
many
a
little
town
will
have
its
photographic
we
have
already
the
weekly
films
from
the
big
centres
with
local
journalism
will
come
devices
for
advertising
home
enterprises
some
staple
products
will
be
made
attractive
by
having
show
their
uses
the
motion
pictures
will
be
in
the
public
schools
to
stay
in
geography
history
zoõlogy
botany
physiology
and
other
sciences
will
be
illustrated
by
standardized
films
along
with
these
changes
there
will
be
available
at
certain
centres
collections
of
films
equivalent
to
the
standard
dictionary
and
the
encyclopædia
britannica
and
sooner
or
later
we
will
have
a
capture
of
a
complete
film
expression
by
the
serious
forces
of
civilization
the
merely
impudent
motion
picture
will
be
relegated
to
the
leisure
hours
with
yellow
journalism
photoplay
libraries
are
inevitable
as
active
if
not
as
multitudinous
as
the
libraries
the
oncoming
machinery
and
expense
of
the
motion
picture
is
immense
where
will
the
money
come
from
no
one
knows
what
the
people
want
they
will
get
the
race
of
man
can
not
afford
automobiles
but
has
them
nevertheless
we
can
not
run
away
into
existence
or
or
life
long
at
a
time
we
must
conquer
this
thing
while
the
more
stately
scientific
and
educational
aspects
just
enumerated
are
slowly
on
their
way
the
artists
must
be
up
and
about
their
ameliorative
work
every
considerable
effort
to
develop
a
noble
idiom
will
count
in
the
final
result
as
the
writers
of
early
english
made
possible
the
language
of
the
bible
shakespeare
and
milton
we
are
perfecting
a
medium
to
be
used
as
long
as
chinese
ideographs
have
been
it
will
no
doubt
like
the
chinese

record
in

massive
and
classical

imperial
chronicles

admonitions
all
this
by

a
recording
instrument
not
necessarily
the
a
much
more
limited
thing
a
form
of

what
shall
be
done
in
especial
by
this
generation
of
idealists
whose
flags
rise
and
go
down
whose
battle
line
wavers
and
breaks
a
thousand
times
what
is
the
high
quixotic
splendid
call
we
know
of
a
group
of
people
who
advocate
in
endowed
films
safety
first
another
that
champions
total
abstinence
often
their
work
seems
lost
in
the
mass
of
commercial
production
but
it
is
a
good
beginning
such
citizens
take
an
established
studio
for
a
specified
time
and
at
the
end
put
on
the
market
a
production
that
backs
up
their
particular
idea
there
are
certain
terms
between
the
owners
of
the
film
and
the
proprietors
of
the
studio
for
the
division
of
the
income
the
profits
of
the
cult
being
spent
on
further
propaganda
the
product
need
not
necessarily
be
the
type
outlined
in
chapter
two
the
photoplay
of
action
often
some
other
sort
might
establish
the
cause
more
deeply
but
most
of
the
propaganda
films
are
of
the
action
variety
because
of
the
dynamic
character
of
the
people
who
produce
them
fired
by
fanatic
zeal
the
auto
speeds
faster
the
rescuing
hero
runs
harder
the
stern
policeman
and
sheriff
become
more
jumpy
all
that
the
audience
may
be
converted
here
if
anywhere
meditation
on
the
actual
resources
of
charm
and
force
in
the
art
is
a
fitting
thing
the
crusader
should
realize
that
it
is
not
a
good
action
play
nor
even
a
good
argument
unless
it
is
indeed
the
winged
victory
sort
the
gods
are
not
always
on
the
side
of
those
who
throw
fits
there
is
here
appended
a
newspaper
description
of
a
crusading
film
that
despite
the
implications
of
the
notice
has
many
passages
of
charm
it
is
action
photoplay
the
notice
does
not
imply
that
at
times
the
story
takes
pains
to
be
gentle
this
bit
of
writing
is
all
too
typical
of
film
journalism
not
only
as
an
argument
for
suffrage
but
as
a
play
with
a
story
a
punch
and
a
mission
girl
and
mine
is
produced
under
the
direction
of
the
national

katharine
henry
played
the
villain
and
the
honest
working

about
three
hundred
secondaries
were
engaged
along
with
the
principals
it
is
melodrama
of
the
most
thrilling
sort
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
moral
concealed
in
the
very
title
of
the
play
but
who
is
worried
by
a
moral
in
a
play
which
has
an
exciting
fight
between
a
man
and
a
woman
in
one
of
the
earliest
acts
when
the
quick
march
of
events
ranges
from
a
wedding
to
a
murder
and
an
automobile
abduction
scene
that
breaks
all

in
most
symbolically
and
poetically
a
symbolic
figure

at
critical
periods
in
the
plot
anna

famous

leader
appears
personally
in
the
film
girl
and
mine
is
a
big
play
with
a
big
mission
built
on
a
big
scale
it
is
a
whole
evening
entertainment
and
a
very
interesting
evening
at
that
here
endeth
the
newspaper
notice
compare
it
with
the
biograph
advertisement
of
judith
in
chapter
six
there
is
nothing
in
the
film
that
rasps
like
this
account
of
it
the
clipping
serves
to
give
the
through
which
our
suffrage
joan
of
arcs
move
to
conquest
and
glory
with
unstained
banners
the
obvious
amendments
to
the
production
as
an
instrument
of
persuasion
are
two
firstly
there
should
be
five
reels
instead
of
six
every
scene
shortened
a
bit
to
bring
this
result
secondly
the
lieutenant
governor
of
the
state
who
is
the
rudolf
rassendyll
of
the
production
does
not
enter
the
story
soon
enough
and
is
too
james
hacketty
all
at
once
we
are
jerked
into
admiration
of
him
rather
than
ensnared
but
after
that
the
gentleman
behaves
more
handsomely
than
any
of
the
distinguished
lieutenant
governors
in
real
life
the
present
writer
happens
to
remember
the
figure
of
aunt
jane
the
queenly
serious
woman
of
affairs
is
one
to
admire
and
love
her
effectiveness
without
excess
or
strain
is
in
itself
an
argument
for
giving
woman
the
vote
the
newspaper
notice
does
not
state
the
facts
in
saying
the
symbolical
figure
fades
out
at
critical
periods
in
the
plot
on
the
contrary
she
appears
at
critical
periods
clothed
in
white
solemn
and
royal
she
comes
into
the
groups
with
an
adequate
allurement
pointing
the
moral
of
each
situation
while
she
shines
brightest
the
two
children
for
whom
the
contest
is
fought
are
winsome
little
girls
by
the
side
of
their
mother
in
the
garden
or
in
the
nursery
they
are
a
potent
argument
for
the
natural
rights
of
femininity
the
film
is
by
no
means
the
implications
of
the

the

they

pour
on

before
they

would
result
in

standardization
of

over

he
is
at
present
the
victim
of
the
alleged
truth
of
the
specious
and
sentimental
variety
of

it
gives
the
precise
edges
of
the
coat
or
collar
of
the
smirking
masher
and
the
exact
fibre
in
the
dress
of
the
the
eye
grows
weary
of
sharp
points
and
hard
edges
that
mean
nothing
all
this
idiotic
precision
is
going
to
waste
it
should
be
enlisted
in
the
cause
of
science
and
abated
everywhere
else
the
edges
in
art
are
as
mysterious
as
in
science
they
are
exact
some
of
the
higher
forms
of
the
intimate
moving
picture
play
should
be
endowed
by
local
coteries
representing
their
particular
region
every
community
of
fifty
thousand
has
its
group
of
the
cultured
who
have
heretofore
studied
and
imitated
things
done
in
the
big
cities
some
of
these
coteries
will
in
exceptional
cases
become
creative
and
begin
to
express
their
habitation
and
name
the
intimate
photoplay
is
capable
of
that
delicacy
and
that
informality
which
should
characterize
neighborhood
enterprises
the
plays
could
be
acted
by
the
group
who
season
after
season
have
secured
the
opera
house
for
the
annual
amateur
show
other
dramatic
ability
could
be
found
in

there
is
enough
talent
in
any
place
to
make
an
artistic
revolution
if
once
that
region
is
aflame
with
a
common
vision
the
spirit
that
made
the
irish
players
all
so
racy
of
the
soil
can
also
move
the
company
of
local
photoplayers
in
topeka
or
indianapolis
or
denver
then
let
them
speak
for
their
town
not
only
in
great
occasional
enterprises
but
steadily
in
little
fancies
genre
pictures
developing
a
technique
that
will
finally
make
magnificence
possible
there
was
given
not
long
ago
at
the
illinois
country
club
here
a
performance
of
the
yellow
jacket
by
the
coburn
players
it
at
once
seemed
an
integral
part
of
this
chapter
the
two
flags
used
for
a
chariot
the
bamboo
poles
for
oars
the
red
sack
for
a
decapitated
head
were
all
convincing
through
a
direct
resemblance
as
well
as
the
passionate
acting
they
suggest
a
possible
type
of
hieroglyphics
to
be
developed
by
the
leader
of
the
local
group
let
the
enthusiast
study
this
westernized
chinese
play
for
primitive
representative
methods
it
can
be
found
in
book
form
a
most
readable
work
it
is
by
hazelton
and
benrimo
the
resemblance
between
the
stage
property
and
the
thing
represented
is
fairly
close
the
moving
flags
on
each
side
of
the
actor
suggest
the
actual
color
and
progress
of
the
chariot
and
abstractly
suggest
its
magnificence
the
red
sack
used
for
a
bloody
head
has
at
least
the
color
and
size
of
one
the
block
of
wood
used
for
a
child
is
the
length
of
an
infant
of
the
age
described
and
wears
the
general
costume
thereof
the
hoe
though
exaggerated
is
still
an
agricultural
implement
the
evening
list
of
properties
is
economical
filling
one
wagon
rather
than
three
photographic
realism
is
splendidly
put
to
rout
by
powerful
representation
when
the
villager
desires
to
embody
some
episode
that
if
realistically
given
would
require
a
setting
beyond
the
means
of
the
available
endowment
and
does
not
like
the
method
let
him
evolve
his
set
of
symbols
the
yellow
jacket
was
written
after
long
familiarity
with
the
chinese
theatre
in
san
francisco
the
play
is
a
glory
to
that
city
as
well
as
to
hazelton
and
benrimo
but
every
town
in
the
united
states
has
something
as
striking
as
the
chinese
theatre
to
the
man
who
keeps
the
eye
of
his
soul
open
it
has
its
ministerial
association
its
boys
secret
society
its
political
gang
its
grubby
justice
of
the
peace
court
its
free
school
for
the
teaching
of
hebrew
its
snobbish
chapel
its
house
its
milliner
shop
all
these
could
be
made
visible
in
photoplays
as
flies
are
preserved
in
amber
edgar
lee
masters
looked
about
him
and
discovered
the
village
graveyard
and
made
it
as
wonderful
as
noah
ark
or
adam
naming
the
animals
by
supplying
honest
inscriptions
to
the
headstones
such
stories
can
be
told
by
the
chinese
theatrical
system
as
well
as
many
different
films
could
be
included
under
the
general
title
seven
old
families
and
why
they
went
to
smash
or
a
less
ominous
series
would
be
seven
victorious
souls
for
there
are
triumphs
every
day
under
the
drab
monotony
of
an
apparently
defeated
town
conquests
worthy
of
the
waving
of
above
all
the
yellow
jacket
points
a
moral
for
this
chapter
because
there
was
conscience
behind
it
first
the
rectitude
of
the
chinese
actors
of
san
francisco
who
kept
the
dramatic
tradition
alive
a
tradition
that
was
bequeathed
from
the
ancient
generations
then
the
artistic
integrity
of
the
men
who
readapted
the
tradition
for
western
consumption
and
their
religious
attitude
that
kept
the
high
teaching
and
devout
feeling
for
human
life
intact
in
the
play
then
the
zeal
of
the
drama
league
that
indorsed
it
for
the
country
then
the
earnest
work
of
the
coburn
players
who
embodied
it
devoutly
so
that
the
whole
company
became
dear
friends
forever
by
some
such
ladder
of
conscience
as
this
can
the
local
scenario
be
endowed
written
acted
filmed
and
made
a
real
part
of
the
community
life
the
yellow
jacket
was
a
drama
not
a
photoplay
this
chapter
does
not
urge
that
it
be
readapted
for
a
photoplay
in
san
francisco
or
anywhere
else
but
a
kindred
something
as
beautiful
and
worthy
and
intimate
in
strictly
photoplay
terms
might
well
be
the
flower
of
the
work
of
the
local
groups
of
film
actors
harriet
monroe
magazine
poetry
chicago
has
given
us
a
new
sect
the
imagists
ezra
pound
richard
aldington
john
gould
fletcher
amy
lowell
flint
lawrence
and
others
they
are
gathering
followers
and
imitators
to
these
followers
i
would
say
the
imagist
impulse
need
not
be
confined
to
verse
why
would
you
be
imitators
of
these
leaders
when
you
might
be
creators
in
a
new
medium
there
is
a
clear
parallelism
between
their
point
of
view
in
verse
and
the
photoplay
especially
when
it
is
developed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
last
part
of
chapter
nine
measured
without
sound
plus
time
measured
without
there
is
no
clan
more
purely
devoted
to
art
for
art
sake
than
the
imagist
clan
an
imagist
film
would
offer
a
noble
challenge
to
the
overstrained
emotion
the
splendor
the
mere
repetition
of
what
are
at
present
the
finest
photoplays
now
even
the
masterpieces
are
incontinent
except
for
some
of
the
old
biographs
of
beginning
there
is
nothing
of
doric
restraint
from
the
best
to
the
worst
read
some
of
the
poems
of
the
people
listed
above
then
imagine
the
same
moods
in
the
films
imagist
photoplays
would
be
japanese
prints
taking
on
life
animated
japanese
paintings
pompeian
mosaics
in
kaleidoscopic
but
logical
succession
beardsley
drawings
made
into
actors
and
scenery
greek
in
motion
scarcely
a
photoplay
but
hints
at
the
imagists
in
one
scene
then
the
illusion
is
lost
in
the
next
turn
of
the
reel
perhaps
it
would
be
a
sound
observance
to
confine
this
form
of
motion
picture
to
a
half
reel
or
quarter
reel
just
as
the
imagist
poem
is
generally
a
half
or
quarter
page
a
series
of
them
could
fill
a
special
evening
the
imagists
are
colorists
some
people
do
not
consider
that
photographic
black
white
and
gray
are
color
but
here
for
instance
are
seven
colors
which
the
imagists
might
use
the
whiteness
of
swans
in
the
light
the
whiteness
of
swans
in
a
gentle
shadow
the
color
of
a
sunburned
man
in
the
light
his
color
in
a
gentle
shadow
his
color
in
a
deeper
shadow
the
blackness
of
black
velvet
in
the
light
the
blackness
of
black
velvet
in
a
deep
shadow
and
to
use
these
colors
with
definite
steps
from
one
to
the
other
does
not
militate
against
an
artistic
mystery
of
edge
and
softness
in
the
flow
of
line
there
is
a
list
of
possible
imagist
textures
which
is
only
limited
by
the
number
of
things
to
be
seen
in
the
world
probably
only
seven
or
ten
would
be
used
in
one
scheme
and
the
same
list
kept
through
one
production
the
imagist
photoplay
will
put
discipline
into
the
inner
ranks
of
the
enlightened
and
remind
the
sculptors
painters
and
architects
of
the
movies
that
there
is
a
continence
even
beyond
sculpture
and
that
seas
of
realism
may
not
have
the
power
of
a
little
elimination
the
use
of
the
scientific
film
by
established
institutions
like
schools
and
state
governments
has
been
discussed
let
the
church
also
in
her
own
way
avail
herself
of
the
motion
picture
as
in
mediæval
time
she
took
over
the
marvel
of
italian
painting
there
was
a
stage
in
her
history
when
religious
representation
was
by
byzantine
mosaics
noble
in
color
having
an
architectural
use
but
curious
indeed
to
behold
from
the
standpoint
of
those
who
crave
a
sensitive
emotional
record
the
first
paintings
of
cimabue
and
giotto
giving
these
formulas
a
touch
of
life
were
hailed
with
joy
by
all
italy
now
the
church
universal
has
an
opportunity
to
establish
her
new
painters
if
she
will
she
has
taken
over
in
the
course
of
history
for
her
glory
miracle
plays
romanesque
and
gothic
architecture
stained
glass
windows
and
the
music
of
cecilia
organ
why
not
this
new
splendor
the
cathedral
of
john
the
divine
on
morningside
heights
should
establish
in
its
crypt
motion
pictures
as
thoroughly
considered
as
the
lines
of
that
building
if
possible
designed
by
the
architects
thereof
with
the
same
sense
of
permanency
this
chapter
does
not
advocate
that
the
church
lay
hold
of
the
photoplays
as
one
more
medium
for
reillustrating
the
stories
of
the
bible
as
they
are
given
in
the
papers
it
is
not
pietistic
simpering
that
will
feed
the
spirit
of
christendom
but
a
steady
of
the
most
skilful
and
original
motion
picture
artists
let
the
church
follow
the
precedent
which
finally
gave
us

the
rest

great
crusading
films
who
will
see
that
the
public

and
university
researches
take
on
the
form
of
motion
pictures
who
will
endow
the
local
photoplay
and
the
imagist
photoplay
who
will
take
the
first
great
measures
to
insure
motion
picture
splendors
in
the
church
things
such
as
these
come
on

to

that

approximate
utopias

it

others
in
dominating
this
land
or
such
is
one
of
many
speculations
of
the
present
writer
the
photoplay
can
speak
the
language
of
the
man
who
has
a
mind
fair
size
that
we
are
going
to
have
successive
generations
of
such
builders
may
be
reasonably
implied
from
past
expositions
beginning
with
philadelphia
in
and
going
on
to
san
francisco
and
san
diego
in
nothing
seems
to
stop
us
from
the
habit
let
us
enlarge
this
proclivity
into
a
national
mission
in
as
definite
a
movement
as
thoroughly
thought
out
as
the
evolution
of
the
public
school
system
the
formation
of
the
steel
trust
and
the
like
after
duly
weighing
all
the
world
fairs
let
our
architects
set
about
making
the
whole
of
the
united
states
into
a
permanent
one
supposing
the
date
to
begin
the
erection
be
till
that
time
there
should
be
tireless
if
indirect
propaganda
that
will
further
the
architectural
state
of
mind
and
later
bring
about
the
elucidation
of
the
plans
while
they
are
being
perfected
for
many
years
this
america
founded
on
the
psychology
of
the
splendor
photoplay
will
be
evolving
it
might
be
conceived
as
a
going
concern
at
a
certain
date
within
the
lives
of
men
now
living
but
it
should
never
cease
to
develop
to
make
films
of
a
more
beautiful
united
states
is
as
practical
and
worth
while
a
custom
as
to
make
military
spy
maps
of
every
inch
of
a
territory
putting
in
each
fence
and
those
who
would
satisfy
the
national
pride
with
something
besides
battle
flags
must
give
our
people
an
objective
as
shining
and
splendid
as
war
when
it
is
most
glittering
something
napoleonic
and
with
no
outward
pretence
of
excessive
virtue
we
want
a
substitute
as
dramatic
internationally
yet
friend
making
if
america
is
to
become
the
financial
centre
through
no
fault
of
her
own
that
fact
must
have
a
symbol
other
than
guns
on
the
if
it
is
inexpedient
for
the
architectural
patriarchs
and
their
young
hopefuls
to
take
over
the
films
bodily
let
a
board
of
strategy
be
formed
who
make
it
their
business
to
eat
dinner
with
the
scenario
writers
producers
and
owners
conspiring
with
them
in
some
practical
way
why
should
we
not
consider
ourselves
a
deathless
exposition
on
a
scale
let
chicago
be
the
transportation
building
denver
the
mining
building
let
kansas
city
be
the
agricultural
building
and
jacksonville
florida
the
horticultural
building
and
so
around
the
states
even
as
in
mediæval
times
men
rode
for
hundreds
of
miles
through
perils
to
the
permanent
fairs
of
the
free
cities
the
will
attend
this
exhibit
and
many
of
them
will
in
the
end
become
citizens
our
immigration
will
be
something
more
than
tide
upon
tide
of
raw
labor
the
architects
would
send
forth
publicity
films
which
are
not
only
delineations
of
a
future
cincinnati
cleveland
or
louis
but
whole
counties
and
states
and
groups
of
states
could
be
planned
at
one
time
with
the
development
of
their
natural
fauna
flora
and
forestry
wherever
nature
has
been
rendered
desolate
by
industry
or
mere
haste
there
let
the
architect
and
proclaim
the
plan
wherever
she
is
still
splendid
and
untamed
let
her
not
be
violated
america
is
in
the
state
of
mind
where
she
must
visualize
herself
again
if
it
is
not
possible
to
bring
in
the
new
jerusalem
by
public
act
with
every
citizen
eating
bread
and
honey
under
his
vine
and
owning
forty
acres
and
a
mule
singing
hymns
and
saying
prayers
all
his
leisure
hours
it
is
still
reasonable
to
think
out
tremendous
things
the
american
people
can
do
in
the
light
of
what
they
have
done
without
sacrificing
any
of
their
native
cussedness
or
kick
it
was
sprawling
chicago
that
in
achieved
the
white
city
the
automobile
routes
bind
the
states
together
closer
than
muddy
counties
were
held
in
a
permanent
world
fair
may
be
a
phrase
distressing
to
the
literal
mind
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
an
architect
america
let
each
city
take
expert
counsel
from
the
architectural
demigods
how
to
tear
out
the
dirty
core
of
its
principal
business
square
and
erect
a
combination
of
civic
centre
and
permanent
and
glorious
bazaar
let
the
public
debate
the
types
of
state
flower
tree
and
shrub
that
are
expedient
the
varieties
of
villages
and
towns
and
connecting
parkways
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
the
american
expositions
are
as
characteristic
things
as
our
land
has
achieved
they
went
through
without
hesitation
the
difficulties
of
one
did
not
deter
the
erection
of
the
next
the
united
states
may
be
in
many
things
slack
often
the
democracy
looks
hopelessly
shoddy
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
our
people
have
always
risen
to
the
dignity
of
these
great
architectural
projects
once
the
population
understand
they
are
dealing
with
the
same
type
of
idea
on
a
grander
scale
they
will
follow
to
the
end
we
are
not
proposing
an
economic
revolution
or
that
human
nature
be
suddenly
altered
if
california
can
remain
in
the
world
fair
state
of
mind
for
four
or
five
years
and
finally
achieve
such
a
splendid
result
all
the
states
can
undertake
a
similar
project
conjointly
and
because
of
the
momentum
of
a
nation
moving
together
remain
in
that
mind
for
the
length
of
the
life
of
a
man
here
we
have
this
great
instrument
the
motion
picture
the
fourth
largest
industry
in
the
united
states
attended
daily
by
ten
million
people
and
in
ten
days
by
a
hundred
million
capable
of
interpreting
the
largest
conceivable
ideas
that
come
within
the
range
of
the
plastic
arts
and
those
ideas
have
not
been
supplied
it
is
still
the
plaything
of
newly
rich
vaudeville
managers
the
nation
goes
daily
through
intrinsic
interest
in
the
device
and
is
dosed
with
such
continued
stories
as
the
adventures
of
kathlyn
what
happened
to
mary
and
the
million
dollar
mystery
stretched
on
through
reel
after
reel
week
after
week
kathlyn
had
no
especial
adventures
nothing
in
particular
happened
to
mary
the
million
dollar
mystery
was
why
did
the
millionaires
who
owned
such
a
magnificent
instrument
descend
to
such
silliness
and
impose
it
on
the
people
why
can
not
our
weekly
story
be
henceforth
some
great
plan
that
is
being
worked
out
whose
history
will
delight
us
for
instance
every
stage
of
the
building
of
the
panama
canal
was
followed
with
the
greatest
interest
in
the
films
but
there
was
not
enough
of
it
to
keep
the
films
busy
the
great
material
projects
are
often
easier
to
realize
than
the
little
moral
reforms
beautiful
architectural
undertakings
while
appearing
to
be
material
and
succeeding
by
the
laws
of
american
enterprise
bring
with
them
the
healing
hand
of
beauty
beauty
is
not
directly
pious
but
does
more
civilizing
in
its
proper
hour
than
many
sermons
or
laws
the
world
seems
to
be
in
the
hands
of
adventurers
why
not
this
for
the
adventure
of
the
american
architects
if
something
akin
to
this
plan
does
not
come
to
pass
through
photoplay
propaganda
it
means
there
is
no
american
builder
with
the
blood
of
julius
cæsar
in
his
veins
if
there
is
the
old
brute
lust
for
empire
left
in
any
builder
let
him
awake
the
world
is
before
him
as
for
the
other
utopians
the
economist
the
physician
the
puritan
as
soon
as
the
architects
have
won
over
the
photoplay
people
let
these
others
take
sage
counsel
and
ensnare
the
architects
is
there
a
reform
worth
while
that
can
not
be
embodied
and
enforced
by
a
invention
a
mere
city
plan
carried
out
or
the
name
or
intent
of
a
building
and
the
list
of
offices
within
it
may
bring
about
more
salutary
economic
change
than
all
the
debating
and
voting
imaginable
so
without
too
much
theorizing
why
not
erect
our
new
america
and
move
into
it
chapter
xix
on
coming
forth
by
day
if
he
will
be
so
indulgent
with
his
author
let
the
reader
approach
the
photoplay
theatre
as
though
for
the
first
time
having
again
a
new
point
of
view
here
the
poorest
can
pay
and
enter
from
the
glaring
afternoon
into
the
twilight
of
an
ali
baba
cave
the
dime
is
the
single
required
the
wherein
the
audience
is
seated
by
which
they
can
read
in
an
emergency
is
as
bright
and
dark
as
that
of
some
churches
it
reveals
much
in
the
faces
and
figures
of
the
audience
that
can
not
be
seen
by
common
day
hard
edges
are
the
main
things
that
we
lose
the
gain
is
in
all
the
delicacies
of
modelling
form
and
color
a
hundred
evanescent
impressions
come
and
go
there
is
often
a
tenderness
of
appeal
about
the
most
rugged
face
in
the
assembly
humanity
takes
on
its
sacred
aspect
it
is
a
crude
mind
that
would
insist
that
these
appearances
are
not
real
that
the
eye
does
not
see
them
when
all
eyes
behold
them
to
say
dogmatically
that
any
new
thing
seen
by
is
an
illusion
is
like
arguing
that
a
discovery
by
the
telescope
or
microscope
is
unreal
if
the
appearances
are
beautiful
besides
they
are
not
only
facts
but
assets
in
our
lives
is
not
done
in
the
direct
we
retire
to
the
shaded
porch
it
takes
two
more
steps
toward
quietness
of
light
to
read
the
human
face
and
figure
many
great
paintings
and
poems
are
records
of
things
discovered
in
this
quietness
of
light
it
is
indeed
ironical
in
our
ali
baba
cave
to
see
sheer
everydayness
and
hardness
upon
the
screen
the
audience
dragged
back
to
the
street
they
have
escaped
one
of
the
inventions
to
bring
the
twilight
of
the
gathering
into
brotherhood
with
the
shadows
on
the
screen
is
a
simple
thing
known
to
the
trade
as
the
fadeaway
that
had
its
rise
in
a
commonplace
fashion
as
a
method
of
keeping
the
story
from
ending
with
the
white
glare
of
the
empty
screen
as
a
result
of
the
device
the
figures
in
the
first
episode
emerge
from
the
dimness
and
in
the
last
one
go
back
into
the
shadow
whence
they
came
as
foam
returns
to
the
darkness
of
an
evening
sea
in
the
imaginative
pictures
the
principle
begins
to
be
applied
more
largely
till
throughout
the
fairy
story
the
figures
float
in
and
out
from
the
unknown
as
fancies
should
this
method
in
its
simplicity
counts
more
to
keep
the
place
an
ali
baba
cave
than
many
a
more
complicated
procedure
in
luxurious
scenes
it
brings
the
soft
edges
of
correggio
and
in
solemn
ones
a
light
and
shadow
akin
to
the
effects
of
rembrandt
now
we
have
a
darkness
on
which
we
can
paint
an
unspoiled
twilight
we
need
not
call
it
the
arabian
cave
there
is
a
tomb
we
might
have
definitely
in
mind
an
egyptian
where
with
a
torch
we
might
enter
read
the
inscriptions
and
see
the
illustrations
from
the
book
of
the
dead
on
the
wall
or
finding
that
ancient
papyrus
in
the
unroll
it
and
show
it
to
the
eager
assembly
and
have
the
feeling
of
return
man
is
an
egyptian
first
before
he
is
any
other
type
of
civilized
being
the
nile
flows
through
his
heart
so
let
this
cave
be
egypt
let
us
incline
ourselves
to
revere
the
unconscious
memories
that
echo
within
us
when
we
see
the
hieroglyphics
of
osiris
and
isis
egypt
was
our
long
brooding
youth
we
built
the
mysteriousness
of
the
universe
into
the
pyramids
carved
it
into
every
line
of
the
sphinx
we
thought
always
of
the
immemorial
the
reel
now
before
us
is
the
mighty
judgment
roll
dealing
with
the
question
of
our
departure
in
such
a
way
that
any
man
who
beholds
it
will
bear
the
impress
of
the
admonition
upon
his
heart
forever
those
egyptian
priests
did
no
little
thing
when
amid
their
superstitions
they
still
proclaimed
the
judgment
let
no
one
consider
himself
ready
for
death
till
like
the
men
by
the
nile
he
can
call
up
every
scene
face
with
courage
every
exigency
of
the
ordeal
there
is
one
copy
of
the
book
of
the
dead
of
especial
interest
made
for
the
scribe
ani
with
exquisite
marginal
drawings
copies
may
be
found
in
our
large
libraries
the
particular
i
had
the
honor
to
see
was
in
the
lenox
library
new
york
several
years
ago
ani
according
to
the
formula
of
the
priesthood
goes
through
the
adventures
required
of
a
shade
before
he
reaches
the
court
of
osiris
all
the
egyptian
pictures
on
and
temple
are
but
enlarged
made
into
tableaus
through
such
tableaus
ani
moves
the
ani
manuscript
has
so
fascinated
some
of
the
egyptologists
that
it
is
copied
in
figures
fifteen
feet
high
on
the
walls
of
two
of
the
rooms
of
the
british
museum
and
you
can
read
the
story
eloquently
told
in
maspero
ani
knocks
at
many
doors
in
the
underworld
monstrous
gatekeepers
are
squatting
on
their
haunches
with
huge
knives
to
slice
him
if
he
can
not
remember
their
names
or
give
the
right
password
or
by
spells
the
priests
have
taught
him
convince
the
sentinels
that
he
is
osiris
himself
to
further
the
illusion
the
name
of
osiris
is
inscribed
on
his
breast
while
he
is
passing
these
perils
his
little
wife
is
looking
on
by
a
sort
of
clairvoyant
sympathy
though
she
is
still
alive
she
is
depicted
mourning
him
and
embracing
his
mummy
on
earth
at
the
same
time
she
accompanies
him
through
the
shadows
ani
ploughs
and
sows
and
reaps
in
the
fields
of
the
underworld
he
is
carried
past
a
dreadful
place
on
the
back
of
the
cow
hathor
after
as
many
adventures
as
browning
childe
roland
he
steps
into
the
of
the
gods
they
sit
in
majestic
rows
he
makes
the
proper
sacrifices
and
advances
to
the
scales
of
justice
there
he
sees
his
own
heart
weighed
against
the
of
truth
by
the
anubis
who
has
already
presided
at
his
embalming
his
own
soul
in
the
form
of
a
hawk
watches
the
ceremony
his
ghost
which
is
another
entity
looks
through
the
door
with
his
little
wife
both
of
them
watch
with
tense
anxiety
the
fate
of
every
phase
of
his
personality
depends
upon
the
purity
of
his
heart
lying
in
wait
behind
anubis
is
a
monster
part
crocodile
part
lion
part
hippopotamus
this
terror
will
eat
the
heart
of
ani
if
it
is
found
corrupt
at
last
he
is
declared
justified
thoth
the
god
of
writing
records
the
verdict
on
his
tablet
the
justified
ani
moves
on
past
the
baffled
devourer
with
the
mystic
presence
of
his
little
wife
rejoicing
at
his
side
they
go
to
the
awful
court
of
osiris
she
makes
sacrifice
with
him
there
the
god
of
the
dead
is
indeed
a
strange
deity
a
seated
mummy
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
royalty
and
with
the
four
sons
of
horus
on
a
lotus
before
him
and
his
two
wives
isis
and
nephthys
standing
behind
his
throne
with
their
hands
on
his
shoulders
the
justified
soul
now
boards
the
boat
in
which
the
sun
rides
as
it
journeys
through
the
night
he
rises
a
glorious
boatman
in
the
morning
working
an
oar
to
speed
the
craft
through
the
high
ocean
of
the
noon
sky
henceforth
he
makes
the
eternal
round
with
the
sun
therefore
in
ancient
egypt
the
roll
was
called
not
the
book
of
the
dead
but
chapters
on
coming
forth
by
this
book
on
motion
pictures
does
not
profess
to
be
an
expert
treatise
on
egyptology
as
well
the
learned
folk
are
welcome
to
amend
the
modernisms
that
have
crept
into
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
something
like
this
story
in
one
form
or
another
held
egypt
for
many
hundred
years
it
was
the
force
behind
every
mummification
it
was
the
reason
for
the
whole
egyptian
system
of
life
death
and
entombment
for
the
man
not
embalmed
could
not
make
the
journey
so
the
explorer
finds
the
egyptian
with
a
roll
of
this
papyrus
as
a
on
his
mummy
breast
the
soul
needed
to
return
for
refreshment
periodically
to
the
stone
chamber
and
the
mummy
mutilated
or
destroyed
could
not
entertain
the
guest
egypt
cried
out
through
thousands
of
years
for
the
ultimate
resurrection
of
the
whole
man
his
forth
by
we
need
not
fear
that
a
story
that
so
dominated
a
race
will
be
lost
on
modern
souls
when
vividly
set
forth
is
it
too
much
to
expect
that
some
american
of
the
future
will
give
us
this
film
in
the
spirit
of
an
egyptian
priest
the
greeks
the
wisest
people
in
our
limited
system
of
classics
bowed
down
before
the
egyptian
hierarchy
that
cult
must
have
had
a
fine
personal
authority
and
glamour
to
master
such
men
the
unseen
mysteries
were
always
on
the
egyptian
heart
as
a
burden
and
a
consolation
and
though
there
may
have
been
jugglers
in
the
outer
courts
of
these
temples
as
there
have
been
in
the
courts
of
all
temples
no
mere
actor
could
make
an
egyptian
priest
of
himself
their
very
alphabet
has
a
regal
enchantment
in
its
lines
and
the
same
power
remains
in
their
pylons
and
images
under
the
blaze
of
the
noonday
sun
here
is
a
nation
america
going
for
dreams
into
caves
as
shadowy
as
the
tomb
of
queen
thi
there
they
find
too
often
not
that
ancient
priestess
and
ruler
nor
any
of
her
kin
nor
yet
ani
the
scribe
nor
yet
any
of
the
kings
but
shabby
rags
of
fancy
or
circuses
that
were
better
in
the
street
because
ten
million
people
daily
enter
into
the
cave
something
akin
to
egyptian
wizardry
certain
national
rituals
will
be
born
by
studying
the
matter
of
being
an
egyptian
priest
for
a
little
while
the
may
learn
in
the
end
how
best
to
express
and
satisfy
the
that
are
peculiarly
american
it
is
sometimes
out
of
the
oldest
dream
that
the
youngest
vision
is
born
chapter
xx
the
the
whirlwind
of
cowboys
and
indians
with
which
the
photoplay
began
came
about
because
this
instrument
in
asserting
its
genius
was
feeling
its
way
toward
the
most
primitive
forms
of
life
it
could
find
now
there
is
a
tendency
for
even
wilder
things
we
behold
the
figures
living
in
tropical
islands
or
our
hairy
acting
out
narratives
of
the
stone
age
the
moving
picture
conventionality
permits
an
abbreviation
of
drapery
if
the
primitive
setting
is
convincing
the
figure
in
the
or
buffalo
hide
at
once
has
its
rights
over
the
healthful
imagination
there
is
in
this
nation
of
a
hunger
for
tales
of
fundamental
life
that
are
not
yet
told
the
longs
with
an
incurable
homesickness
for
his
ancient
day
one
of
the
fine
photoplays
of
primeval
life
is
the
story
called
man
genesis
described
in
chapter
two
we
face
the
exigency
the
world
over
of
vast
instruments
like
national
armies
being
played
against
each
other
as
idly
and
aimlessly
as
the
on
the
of
corner
groceries
and
this
invention
the
kinetoscope
which
affects
or
will
affect
as
many
people
as
the
guns
of
europe
is
not
yet
understood
in
its
powers
particularly
those
of
bringing
back
the
primitive
in
a
big
rich
way
the
primitive
is
always
a
new
and
higher
beginning
to
the
man
who
understands
it
not
yet
has
the
producer
learned
that
the
feeling
of
the
crowd
is
patriarchal
splendid
he
imagines
the
people
want
nothing
but
a
silly
lark
all
this
apparatus
and
opportunity
and
no
immortal
soul
yet
by
faith
and
a
study
of
the
signs
we
proclaim
that
this
lantern
of
is
going
to
give
us
in
time
the
visible
things
in
the
fulness
of
their
primeval
force
and
some
that
have
been
for
a
long
time
invisible
to
speak
in
a
metaphor
we
are
going
to
have
the
primitive
life
of
genesis
then
all
that
evolution
after
exodus
leviticus
numbers
deuteronomy
joshua
judges
and
on
to
a
new
revelation
of
john
in
this
adolescence
of
democracy
the
history
of
man
is
to
be
retraced
the
same
round
on
a
higher
spiral
of
life
our
democratic
dream
has
been
a
aspiration
built
on
a
bog
of
minds
the
piles
beneath
the
castle
of
our
arts
were
rotting
for
lack
of
the
man
with
the
hoe
had
no
spark
in
his
brain
but
now
a
light
is
blazing
we
can
build
the
american
soul
from
the
foundations
we
can
begin
with
dreams
the
veriest
warrior
can
understand
and
as
far
as
an
appeal
to
the
eye
can
do
it
lead
him
in
fancy
through
every
phase
of
life
to
the
apocalyptic
splendors
this
progress
according
to
the
metaphor
of
this
chapter
will
be
led
by
these
were
the
people
that
dominated
the
of
old
but
what
more
specifically
are
let
us
consider
two
kinds
of
people
scientific
inventors
on
the
one
hand
and
makers
of
art
and
poetry
and
the
like
on
the
other
the
especial
producers
of
art
and
poetry
that
we
are
concerned
with
in
this
chapter
we
will
call
men
like
albert
dürer
rembrandt
blake
elihu
vedder
watts
rossetti
tennyson
coleridge
poe
maeterlinck
yeats
francis
thompson
they
have
a
certain
unearthly
fascination
in
some
one
or
many
of
their
works
a
few
other
men
might
be
added
to
the
list
most
great
names
are
better
described
under
other
categories
though
as
much
beloved
in
their
own
way
but
these
are
especially
adapted
to
being
set
in
opposition
to
a
list
of
mechanical
inventors
that
might
be
called
realists
by
contrast
the
wright
brothers
and
pierpont
langley
thomas
edison
charles
steinmetz
john
hays
hammond
hudson
maxim
graham
bell
the
are
of
various
schools
but
they
have
a
common
tendency
and
character
in
bringing
forth
a
type
of
art
peculiarly
at
war
with
the
realistic
civilization
science
has
evolved
it
is
one
object
of
this
chapter
to
show
that
when
it
comes
to
a
clash
between
the
two
forces
the
wizards
should
rule
and
the
realists
should
serve
them
the
two
functions
go
back
through
history
sometimes
at
war
other
days
in
alliance
the
poet
and
the
scientist
were
brethren
in
the
centuries
of
alchemy
tennyson
bearing
in
mind
such
a
period
took
the
title
of
merlin
in
his
veiled
autobiography
merlin
and
the
gleam
wizards
and
astronomers
were
one
when
the
angels
sang
in
bethlehem
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
men
there
came
magicians
saying
where
is
he
that
is
born
king
of
the
jews
for
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
have
come
to
worship
him
the
modern
world
in
its
gentler
moments
seems
to
take
a
peculiar
thrill
of
delight
from
these
travellers
perhaps
realizing
what
has
been
lost
from
parting
with
such
gentle
seers
and
secular
diviners
every
christmas
half
the
magazines
set
them
forth
in
richest
colors
riding
across
the
desert
following
the
star
to
the
same
manger
where
the
shepherds
are
depicted
those
wizard
kings
whatever
useless
charms
and
talismans
they
wore
stood
for
the
unknown
quantity
in
spiritual
life
a
magician
is
a
man
who
lays
hold
on
the
unseen
for
the
mere
joy
of
it
who
steals
if
necessary
the
holy
bread
and
the
sacred
fire
he
is
often
of
the
remnant
of
an
ostracized
and
disestablished
priesthood
he
is
a
in
the
owing
final
allegiance
to
no
established
sect
the
fires
of
prophecy
are
as
apt
to
descend
upon
him
as
upon
members
of
the
established
faith
he
loves
the
mysterious
for
the
beauty
of
it
the
wildness
and
the
glory
of
it
and
not
always
to
compel
people
to
do
right
it
seems
to
me
that
the
scientific
and
poetic
functions
of
society
should
make
common
cause
again
if
they
are
not
as
in
merlin
time
combined
in
one
personality
they
must
recognize
that
they
serve
the
same
society
but
with
the
understanding
that
the
prophetic
function
is
the
most
important
the
wizard
vocation
the
next
and
the
inventors
and
genius
important
indeed
but
the
third
consideration
the
war
between
the
scientists
and
the
has
come
about
because
of
the
ambition
of
the
scientists
to
rule
or
ruin
they
give
us
the
the
skyscraper
the
the
flying
machine
the
elevated
railroad
the
apartment
house
the
newspaper
the
breakfast
food
the
weapons
of
the
army
the
weapons
of
the
navy
and
think
that
they
have
beautified
our
existence
moreover
some
one
rises
at
this
point
to
make
a
plea
for
the
scientific
imagination
he
says
the
have
brought
us
the
mystery
of
electricity
which
is
no
but
a
special
manifestation
of
the
immanent
god
within
us
and
about
us
he
says
the
student
in
the
laboratory
brought
us
the
the
wireless
telegraph
the
mystery
of
radium
the
mystery
of
all
the
formerly
unharnessed
power
of
god
which
man
is
beginning
to
gather
into
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
one
who
pleads
for
the
scientific
imagination
points
out
that
edison
has
been
called
the
american
wizard
all
honor
to
edison
and
his
kind
and
i
admit
specifically
that
edison
took
the
first
great
mechanical
step
to
give
us
the
practical
kinetoscope
and
make
it
possible
that
the
photographs
even
of
inanimate
objects
thrown
upon
the
may
become
celestial
actors
but
the
final
phase
of
the
transfiguration
is
not
the
work
of
this
inventor
or
any
other
as
long
as
the
photoplays
are
in
the
hands
of
men
like
edison
they
are
mere
voodooism
we
have
nothing
but
moving
day
as
heretofore
described
it
is
only
in
the
hands
of
the
prophetic
and
allied
artists
that
the
kinetoscope
reels
become
as
mysterious
and
dazzling
to
the
thinking
spirit
as
the
wheels
of
ezekiel
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
prophecy
one
can
climb
into
the
operator
box
and
watch
the
stream
of
light
till
he
is
as
dazzled
in
flesh
and
spirit
as
the
moth
that
burns
its
wings
in
the
lamp
but
this
is
while
a
glittering
vision
and
not
a
mere
invention
is
being
thrown
upon
the
screen
the
scientific
man
can
explain
away
the
vision
as
a
matter
of
the
technique
of
double
exposure
double
printing
or
stopping
down
and
having
reduced
it
to
terms
and
shown
the
process
he
expects
us
to
become
secular
and
casual
again
but
of
course
the
sun
itself
is
a
mere
trick
of
heat
and
light
a
dynamo
an
incandescent
globe
to
the
man
in
the
laboratory
to
us
it
must
be
a
fire
upon
the
altar
transubstantiation
must
begin
our
young
magicians
must
derive
strange
new
from
the
veins
of
the
earth
from
the
sap
of
the
trees
from
the
lightning
of
the
sky
as
well
as
the
alchemical
acids
metals
and
flames
then
they
will
kindle
the
beginning
mysteries
for
our
cause
they
will
build
up
a
priesthood
that
is
free
yet
authorized
to
freedom
it
will
be
established
and
disestablished
according
to
the
intrinsic
authority
of
the
light
revealed
now
for
a
closer
view
of
this
vocation
the
picture
of
religious
splendor
has
its
obvious
form
in
the
delineation
of
biblical
scenes
which
in
the
hands
of
the
best
commercial
producers
can
be
made
as
worth
while
as
the
work
of
men
like
tissot
such
films
are
by
no
means
to
be
thought
of
lightly
this
sort
of
work
will
remain
in
the
minds
of
many
of
the
severely
orthodox
as
the
only
kind
of
a
religious
picture
worthy
of
classification
but
there
are
many
further
fields
just
as
the
wireless
receiving
station
or
the
telephone
switchboard
become
heroes
in
the
photoplay
so
aaron
rod
that
confounded
the
egyptians
the
brazen
serpent
that
moses
in
the
wilderness
the
ram
horn
that
caused
the
fall
of
jericho
the
mantle
of
elijah
descending
upon
the
shoulders
of
elisha
from
the
chariot
of
fire
can
take
on
a
physical
electrical
power
and
a
hundred
times
spiritual
meaning
that
they
could
not
have
in
the
dead
stage
properties
of
the
old
miracle
play
or
the
realism
of
the
tissot
school
the
waterfall
and
the
tossing
sea
are
dramatis
personæ
in
the
ordinary
film
romance
so
the
red
sea
overwhelming
pharaoh
the
fires
of
nebuchadnezzar
furnace
sparing
and
sheltering
the
three
holy
children
can
become
celestial
actors
and
winged
couriers
can
appear
in
the
pictures
with
missions
of
import
just
as
an
angel
descended
to
joshua
saying
as
captain
of
the
host
of
the
lord
am
i
now
come
the
pure
mechanic
does
not
accept
the
doctrine
your
alleged
supernatural
appearance
he
says
is
based
on
such
a
simple
fact
as
this
two
pictures
can
be
taken
on
one
film
but
the
analogy
holds
many
primitive
peoples
are
endowed
with
memories
that
are
double
photographs
the
world
faiths
based
upon
centuries
of
these
appearances
are
none
the
less
to
be
revered
because
men
have
temporarily
lost
the
power
of
seeing
their
thoughts
as
pictures
in
the
air
and
for
the
time
abandoned
the
task
of
adding
to
tradition
man
will
not
only
see
visions
again
but
machines
themselves
in
the
hands
of
prophets
will
see
visions
in
the
hands
of
commercial
men
they
are
seeing
alleged
visions
and
the
term
is
a
part
of
studio
slang
unutterably
cheapening
religion
and
tradition
when
confucius
came
he
said
one
of
his
tasks
was
the
rectification
of
names
the
leaders
of
this
age
should
see
that
this
word
comes
to
mean
something
more
than
a
piece
of
studio
slang
if
it
is
the
conviction
of
serious
minds
that
the
mass
of
men
shall
never
again
see
pictures
out
of
heaven
except
through
such
mediums
as
the
kinetoscope
lens
let
all
the
higher
forces
of
our
land
courageously
lay
hold
upon
this
thing
that
saves
us
from
perpetual
spiritual
blindness
when
the
thought
of
primitive
man
embodied
in
misty
forms
on
the
landscape
reached
epic
proportions
in
the
greek
he
saw
the
olympians
more
plainly
than
he
beheld
the
acropolis
myron
polykleitos
phidias
scopas
lysippus
praxiteles
discerned
the
gods
and
demigods
so
clearly
they
afterward
cut
them
from
the
hard
marble
without
wavering
our
guardian
angels
of
must
be
as
clearly
seen
and
nobly
hewn
a
double
mental
vision
is
as
fundamental
in
human
nature
as
the
double
necessity
for
air
and
light
it
is
as
obvious
as
that
a
thing
can
be
both
written
and
spoken
we
have
maintained
that
the
kinetoscope
in
the
hands
of
artists
is
a
higher
form
of
picture
writing
in
the
hands
of
it
will
be
a
higher
form
of
i
have
said
that
the
commercial
men
are
seeing
alleged
visions
take
for
instance
the
large
italian
film
that
attempts
to
popularize
dante
though
it
has
a
scattering
of
noble
passages
and
in
some
brief
episodes
it
is
an
enhancement
of
gustave
doré
taking
it
as
a
whole
it
is
a
false
thing
it
is
full
of
apparitions
worked
out
with
mechanical
skill
yet
dante
soul
is
not
back
of
the
fires
and
swords
of
light
it
gives
to
the
uninitiated
an
outline
of
the
stage
paraphernalia
of
the
inferno
it
has
an
encyclopædic
value
if
dante
himself
had
been
the
high
director
in
the
plenitude
of
his
resources
it
might
still
have
had
that
hollowness
a
list
of
words
making
a
poem
and
a
set
of
apparently
equivalent
pictures
forming
a
photoplay
may
have
an
entirely
different
outcome
it
may
be
like
trying
to
see
a
perfume
or
listen
to
a
taste
religion
that
comes
in
wholly
through
the
eye
has
a
new
world
in
the
films
whose
relation
to
the
old
is
only
discovered
by
experiment
and
intuition
patience
and
devotion
but
let
us
imagine
the
grandson
of
an
italian
immigrant
to
america
a
young
seer
trained
in
the
photoplay
technique
by
the
high
american
masters
knowing
all
the
moving
picture
resources
as
dante
knew
italian
song
and
mediæval
learning
assume
that
he
has
a
genius
akin
to
that
of
the
florentine
let
him
be
a
modernist
catholic
if
you
will
let
him
begin
his
message
in
the
timber
lands
of
minnesota
or
the
forests
of
alaska
in
midway
of
this
our
mortal
life
i
found
me
in
a
gloomy
wood
astray
then
let
him
paint
new
pictures
of
just
punishment
beyond
the
grave
and
merciful
rehabilitation
and
great
reward
let
his
hell
purgatory
and
paradise
be
built
of
those
things
which
are
deepest
and
highest
in
the
modern
mind
yet
capable
of
emerging
in
form
men
are
needed
therefore
they
will
come
and
lest
they
come
weeping
accursed
and
alone
let
us
ask
how
shall
we
recognize
them
there
is
no
standard
by
which
to
discern
the
true
from
the
false
prophet
except
the
mood
that
is
engendered
by
contemplating
the
messengers
of
the
past
every
man
has
his
own
roll
call
of
noble
magicians
selected
from
the
larger
group
but
here
are
the
names
with
which
this
chapter
began
with
some
words
on
their
work
albert
dürer
is
classed
as
a
renaissance
painter
yet
his
art
has
its
in
the
early
romanesque
savageness
and
strangeness
and
the
reader
remembers
dürer
brooding
muse
called
melancholia
that
so
obsessed
kipling
in
the
light
that
failed
but
the
went
into
nearly
all
the
dürer
and
etchings
rembrandt
is
a
not
only
in
his
shadowy
portraits
but
in
his
etchings
of
holy
scenes
even
his
simplest
cobweb
lines
become
incantations
other
artists
in
the
high
tides
of
history
have
had
kindred
qualities
but
coming
close
to
our
day
elihu
vedder
the
american
the
illustrator
of
the
rubáiyát
found
it
a
poem
questioning
all
things
and
his
very
illustrations
answer
in
a
certain
fashion
with
winds
of
infinity
and
bring
the
songs
of
omar
near
to
the
book
of
job
vedder
portraits
of
lazarus
and
samson
are
conceptions
that
touch
the
hem
of
the
unknown
george
frederick
watts
was
a
painter
of
portraits
of
the
soul
itself
as
in
his
delineations
of
and
morris
and
tennyson
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
two
have
combined
pictures
and
song
blake
and
rossetti
whatever
the
failure
of
their
technique
never
lacked
in
enchantment
students
of
the
motion
picture
side
of
poetry
would
naturally
turn
to
such
men
for
spiritual
precedents
blake
that
strange
londoner
in
his
book
of
job
is
the
paramount
example
of
the
enchanter
doing
his
work
with
the
engraving
tool
in
his
hand
rossetti
dante
dream
is
a
painting
on
the
edge
of
every
paradise
as
for
the
poetry
of
these
two
men
there
are
blake
songs
of
innocence
and
rossetti
blessed
damozel
and
his
burden
of
nineveh
as
for
the
other
poets
we
have
coleridge
the
author
of
christabel
that
piece
of
winter
witchcraft
kubla
khan
that
oriental
dazzlement
and
the
ancient
mariner
that
most
english
of
all
this
list
of
enchantments
of
tennyson
work
besides
merlin
and
the
gleam
there
are
the
poems
when
the
mantle
was
surely
on
his
shoulders
the
lady
of
shalott
the
lotus
eaters
sir
galahad
and
agnes
eve
edgar
poe
always
a
magician
blends
this
power
with
the
prophetical
note
in
the
poem
the
haunted
palace
and
in
the
stories
of
william
wilson
the
black
cat
and
the
heart
this
side
of
a
man
otherwise
a
wizard
only
has
been
well
illustrated
in
the
avenging
conscience
photoplay
from
maeterlinck
we
have
the
bluebird
and
many
another
dream
i
devoutly
hope
i
will
never
see
in
the
films
an
attempt
to
paraphrase
this
master
but
some
disciple
of
his
should
conquer
the
photoplay
medium
giving
us
great
original
works
yeats
has
bestowed
upon
us
the
land
of
heart
desire
the
secret
rose
and
many
another
piece
of
imaginative
glory
let
us
hope
that
we
may
be
spared
any
attempts
to
hastily
paraphrase
his
wonders
for
the
motion
pictures
but
the
man
that
reads
yeats
will
be
better
prepared
to
do
his
own
work
in
the
films
or
to
greet
the
young
new
masters
when
they
come
finally
francis
thompson
in
the
hound
of
heaven
has
written
a
song
that
the
young
wizard
may
lean
upon
forevermore
for
private
guidance
it
is
composed
of
equal
parts
of
wonder
and
conscience
with
this
poem
in
his
heart
the
roar
of
the
elevated
railroad
will
be
no
more
in
his
ears
and
he
will
dream
of
palaces
of
righteousness
and
lead
other
men
to
dream
of
them
till
the
houses
of
mammon
fade
away
chapter
xxi
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
without
airing
my
private
theology
i
earnestly
request
the
most
sceptical
reader
of
this
book
to
assume
that
miracles
in
a
biblical
sense
have
occurred
let
him
take
it
for
granted
in
the
fashion
of
the
strictly
æsthetic
commentator
who
writes
in
sympathy
with
a
fra
angelico
painting
or
as
that
great
modernist
paul
sabatier
does
as
he
approaches
the
problems
of
faith
in
the
life
of
francis
let
him
also
assume
for
the
length
of
time
that
he
is
reading
this
chapter
if
no
longer
that
miracles
in
a
biblical
sense
as
vivid
and
as
real
to
the
body
of
the
church
will
again
occur
two
thousand
years
in
the
future
events
as
wonderful
as
those
others
twenty
centuries
back
let
us
anticipate
that
many
of
these
will
be
upon
american
soil
particularly
as
sons
and
daughters
of
a
new
country
it
is
a
spiritual
necessity
for
us
to
look
forward
to
traditions
because
we
have
so
few
from
the
past
identified
with
the
six
feet
of
black
earth
beneath
us
the
functions
of
the
prophet
whereby
he
definitely
painted
future
sublimities
have
been
too
soon
abolished
in
the
minds
of
the
wise
mere
forecasting
is
left
to
the
weather
bureau
so
far
as
a
great
section
of
the
purely
literary
and
cultured
are
concerned
the
term
prophet
has
survived
in
literature
to
be
applied
to
men
like
carlyle
fiery
spiritual
leaders
who
speak
with
little
pretence
of
revealing
but
in
the
street
definite
forecasting
of
future
events
is
still
the
vulgar
use
of
the
term
dozens
of
sober
historians
predicted
the
present
war
with
a
story
that
was
carried
out
with
much
faithfulness
of
detail
considering
the
thousand
interests
involved
they
have
been
called
prophets
in
a
congratulatory
secular
tone
by
the
man
in
the
street
these
felicitations
come
because
merchants
in
futures
have
been
put
out
of
countenance
from
the
days
of
jonah
and
balaam
till
now
it
is
indeed
a
risky
vocation
yet
there
is
an
undeniable
line
of
successful
forecasting
by
the
hardy
to
be
found
in
the
scripture
and
in
history
in
direct
proportion
as
these
men
of
fiery
speech
were
free
from
sheer
silliness
their
outlook
has
been
considered
and
debated
by
the
gravest
people
round
them
the
heart
of
man
craves
the
seer
take
for
instance
the
promise
of
the
restoration
of
jerusalem
in
glory
that
fills
the
latter
part
of
the
old
testament
it
moves
the
jewish
zionist
the
true
to
this
hour
he
is
even
now
endeavoring
to
fulfil
the
prophecy
consider
the
words
of
john
the
baptist
one
mightier
than
i
cometh
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
i
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
he
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
a
magnificent
foreshadowing
being
both
a
spiritual
insight
and
the
statement
of
a
great
definite
event
the
heeded
seers
of
the
civilization
of
this
our
day
have
been
secular
in
their
outlook
perhaps
the
most
striking
was
karl
marx
in
the
middle
of
the
capitalistic
system
tracing
its
development
from
feudalism
and
pointing
out
as
inevitable
long
before
they
came
such
modern
institutions
as
the
steel
trust
and
the
standard
oil
company
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
the
marxian
prophecy
of
the
international
alliance
of
workingmen
that
is
obscured
by
the
present
conflict
in
europe
and
other
of
his
forecastings
will
be
ultimately
verified
there
have
been
secular
teachers
like
darwin
who
by
a
scientific
reconstruction
of
the
past
have
implied
an
evolutionary
future
based
on
the
biological
outlook
deductions
from
the
teachings
of
darwin
are
said
to
control
those
who
mould
the
international
doings
of
germany
and
japan
there
have
been
like
jules
verne
in
twenty
thousand
leagues
under
the
sea
he
dimly
discerned
the
submarine
there
is
a
type
of
social
prophet
allied
to
verne
edward
bellamy
in
looking
backward
reduced
the
world
to
a
matter
of
pressing
the
button
turning
on
the
phonograph
it
was
a
combination
of
glorified
and
coney
island
on
a
cooperative
basis
a
boy
from
the
country
making
his
first
visit
to
the
woolworth
building
in
new
york
and
riding
in
the
subway
when
it
is
not
too
crowded
might
be
persuaded
by
an
eloquent
city
relative
that
this
is
bellamy
new
jerusalem
a
soul
with
a
greater
insight
is
wells
but
he
too
in
spite
of
his
humanitarian
heart
has
in
a
great
mass
of
his
work
the
laboratory
imagination
serious
americans
pronounce
themselves
beneficiaries
of
wells
works
and
i
confess
myself
edified
and
thoroughly
grateful
nevertheless
one
smells
chemicals
in
the
next
room
when
he
reads
most
of
wells
prophecies
the
has
moved
that
englishman
mind
more
dangerously
than
moonlight
touches
the
brain
of
the
chanting
witch
one
striking
and
typical
story
is
the
food
of
the
gods
it
is
not
only
a
fine
speculation
but
a
great
parable
the
reader
may
prefer
other
tales
many
times
wells
has
gone
into
his
laboratory
to
invent
our
future
in
the
same
state
of
mind
in
which
an
automobile
manufacturer
works
out
an
improvement
in
his
car
his
disposition
has
greatly
mellowed
of
late
in
this
respect
but
underneath
he
is
the
same
wells
citizens
of
america
wise
or
foolish
when
they
look
into
the
coming
days
have
the
submarine
mood
of
verne
the
complacency
of
bellamy
the
wireless
telegraph
enthusiasm
of
wells
if
they
express
hopes
that
can
be
put
into
pictures
with
definite
edges
they
order
machinery
piled
to
the
skies
they
see
the
redeemed
united
states
running
deftly
in
its
jewelled
sockets
ticking
like
a
watch
this
their
own
chosen
outlook
wearies
the
imaginations
of
our
people
they
do
not
know
why
it
gives
no
apocalyptic
joy
only
to
the
young
mechanical
engineer
does
such
a
hope
express
real
utopia
he
can
always
keep
ahead
of
the
devices
that
herald
its
approach
no
matter
what
day
we
attain
and
how
busy
we
are
adjusting
ourselves
he
can
be
moving
on
inventing
more
ruling
the
age
not
being
ruled
by
it
because
this
utopia
is
in
the
air
a
goodly
portion
of
the
precocious
boys
turn
to
mechanical
engineering
youths
with
this
bent
are
the
most
healthful
and
inspiring
young
citizens
we
have
they
and
their
like
will
fulfil
a
multitude
of
the
hopes
of
men
like
verne
bellamy
and
wells
but
if
every
mechanical
inventor
on
earth
voiced
his
dearest
wish
and
lived
to
see
it
worked
out
the
real
drama
of
prophecy
and
fulfilment
as
written
in
the
imagination
of
the
human
race
would
remain
uncompleted
as
browning
says
in
lady
geraldine
courtship
if
we
trod
the
deeps
of
ocean
if
we
struck
the
stars
in
rising
if
we
wrapped
the
globe
intensely
with
one
hot
electric
breath
but
power
within
our
tether
no
new
comprising
and
in
life
we
were
not
greater
men
nor
bolder
men
in
death
john
beheld
the
new
jerusalem
coming
down
out
of
heaven
prepared
as
a
bride
adorned
for
her
husband
not
equipped
as
a
touring
car
varnished
for
its
owner
it
is
my
hope
that
the
moving
picture
will
set
before
the
world
a
new
group
of
pictures
of
the
future
the
chapter
on
the
architect
as
a
crusader
endeavors
to
show
how
by
proclaiming
that
america
will
become
a
permanent
world
fair
she
can
be
made
so
within
the
lives
of
men
now
living
if
courageous
architects
have
the
campaign
in
hand
there
are
other
hopes
that
look
a
long
way
further
they
peer
as
far
into
the
coming
day
as
the
chinese
historian
looks
into
the
past
and
then
they
are
but
halfway
to
the
millennium
any
standard
illustrator
could
give
us
verne
or
bellamy
or
wells
if
he
did
his
best
we
want
pictures
beyond
the
skill
of
any
delineator
in
the
old
mediums
yet
within
the
power
of
the
wizard
photoplay
oh
you
who
are
coming
show
us
everyday
america
as
it
will
be
when
we
are
only
halfway
to
the
millennium
yet
thousands
of
years
in
the
future
tell
what
type
of
honors
men
will
covet
what
property
they
will
still
be
apt
to
steal
what
murders
they
will
commit
what
the
law
court
and
the
jail
will
be
or
what
will
be
the
substitutes
how
the
newspaper
will
appear
the
office
the
busy
street
picture
to
america
the
lovers
in
her
when
usage
shall
have
become
once
again
when
noble
sweethearts
must
break
beautiful
customs
for
the
sake
of
their
dreams
show
us
the
gantlet
of
strange
courtliness
they
must
pass
through
before
they
reach
one
another
obstacles
brought
about
by
the
immemorial
distinctions
of
scholarship
gowns
or
service
badges
make
a
picture
of
a
world
where
machinery
is
so
highly
developed
it
utterly
disappeared
long
ago
show
us
the
antique
united
states
with
ivy
vines
upon
the
popular
socialist
churches
and
images
of
socialist
saints
in
the
niches
of
the
doors
show
us
the
battered
fountains
the
brooding
universities
the
dusty
libraries
show
us
houses
of
administration
with
statues
of
heroes
in
front
of
them
and
gentle
banners
flowing
from
their
pinnacles
then
paint
pictures
of
the
oldest
trees
of
the
time
and
ceremonies
with
unique
costumes
and
a
special
priesthood
show
us
the
marriage
procession
the
christening
the
consecration
of
the
boy
and
girl
to
the
state
show
us
the
political
processions
and
election
riots
show
us
the
people
with
their
graceful
games
their
religious
pantomimes
show
us
impartially
the
memorial
scenes
to
celebrate
the
great
men
and
women
and
the
funerals
of
the
poor
and
then
moving
on
toward
the
millennium
itself
show
america
after
her
victories
have
been
won
and
she
has
grown
old
as
old
as
the
sphinx
then
give
us
the
dragon
and
armageddon
and
the
lake
of
fire
who
would
prophesy
read
the
last
book
in
the
bible
not
to
copy
it
in
form
and
color
but
that
its
power
and
grace
and
terror
may
enter
into
you
delineate
in
your
own
way
as
you
are
led
on
your
own
patmos
the
picture
of
our
land
redeemed
after
fasting
and
prayer
let
the
spirit
conduct
you
till
you
see
in
definite
line
and
form
the
throngs
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
the
colonnades
where
the
arts
are
expounded
the
gardens
where
the
children
dance
that
which
man
desires
that
will
man
become
he
largely
fulfils
his
own
prediction
and
vision
let
him
therefore
have
a
care
how
he
prophesies
and
prays
we
shall
have
a
tin
heaven
and
a
tin
earth
if
the
scientists
are
allowed
exclusive
command
of
our
highest
hours
let
us
turn
to
luke
iv
and
there
was
delivered
unto
him
the
book
of
the
prophet
esaias
and
when
he
had
opened
the
book
he
found
the
place
where
it
was
written
the
spirit
of
the
lord
is
upon
me
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
he
hath
sent
me
to
heal
the
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captives
and
recovering
of
sight
to
the
blind
to
set
at
liberty
them
that
are
bruised
to
preach
the
acceptable
year
of
the
lord
and
he
closed
the
book
and
he
gave
it
again
to
the
minister
and
sat
down
and
the
eyes
of
all
them
that
were
in
the
synagogue
were
fastened
on
him
and
he
began
to
say
unto
them
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
and
all
bare
him
witness
and
wondered
at
the
gracious
words
which
proceeded
out
of
his
mouth
and
they
said
not
this
joseph
son
i
am
moved
to
think
christ
fulfilled
that
prophecy
because
he
had
read
it
from
childhood
it
is
my
entirely
personal
speculation
not
brought
forth
dogmatically
that
scripture
is
not
so
much
inspired
as
it
is
curiously
and
miraculously
inspiring
if
the
new
isaiahs
of
this
time
will
write
their
forecastings
in
photoplay
hieroglyphics
the
children
in
times
to
come
having
seen
those
films
from
infancy
or
their
later
paraphrases
in
more
perfect
form
can
rise
and
say
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
but
without
prophecy
there
is
no
fulfilment
without
isaiah
there
is
no
christ
america
is
often
shallow
in
her
dreams
because
she
has
no
past
in
the
european
and
asiatic
sense
our
soil
has
no
roman
coin
or
buried
altar
or
buddhist
tope
for
this
reason
multitudes
of
american
artists
have
moved
to
europe
and
only
the
most
universal
of
wars
has
driven
them
home
year
after
year
europe
drained
us
of
our
our
highest
painters
and
sculptors
and
the
like
they
have
come
pouring
home
confused
expatriates
trying
to
adjust
themselves
it
is
time
for
the
american
craftsman
and
artist
to
grasp
the
fact
that
we
must
be
men
enough
to
construct
a
that
grows
rich
in
forecastings
in
the
same
way
that
the
past
of
europe
grows
rich
in
sweet
or
terrible
legends
as
men
go
back
into
it

producers
photoplay
actors
endowers

all
you
who
are
taking
the
work
as
a
sacred
trust
i
bid
you
let
us
resolve
that
whatever
america
may
be
she
shall
have
a
day
that
is
beautiful
and
not
crass
spiritual
not
material
let
us
resolve
that
she
shall
dream
dreams
deeper
than
the
sea
and
higher
than
the
clouds
of
heaven
that
she
shall
come
forth
crowned
and
transfigured
with
her
statesmen
and
wizards
and
saints
and
sages
about
her
with
magic
behind
her
and

pray
that
you
be
delivered
from
the
temptation
to
cynicism
and
the
timidities
of
orthodoxy
pray
that
the
workers
in
this
your
glorious
new
art
be
delivered
from
the
mere
lust
of
the
flesh
and
pride
of
life
let
your
spirits
outflame
your
burning
bodies
consider
what
it
will
do
to
your
souls
if
you
are
true
to
