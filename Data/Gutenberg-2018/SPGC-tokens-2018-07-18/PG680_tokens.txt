introduction
it
is
at
my
persuasion
that
these
poems
are
now
published
the
earliest
of
them
were
read
to
me
in
london
in
when
the
writer
was
seventeen
the
later
ones
were
sent
to
me
from
india
in
when
she
was
and
they
belong
i
think
almost
wholly
to
those
two
periods
as
they
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
individual
beauty
of
their
own
i
thought
they
ought
to
be
published
the
writer
hesitated
your
letter
made
me
very
proud
and
very
sad
she
wrote
is
it
possible
that
i
have
written
verses
that
are
with
beauty
and
is
it
possible
that
you
really
think
them
worthy
of
being
given
to
the
world
you
know
how
high
my
ideal
of
art
is
and
to
me
my
poor
casual
little
poems
seem
to
be
less
than
beautiful
i
mean
with
that
final
enduring
beauty
that
i
desire
and
in
another
letter
she
writes
i
am
not
a
poet
really
i
have
the
vision
and
the
desire
but
not
the
voice
if
i
could
write
just
one
poem
full
of
beauty
and
the
spirit
of
greatness
i
should
be
exultantly
silent
for
ever
but
i
sing
just
as
the
birds
do
and
my
songs
are
as
ephemeral
it
is
for
this
quality
of
song
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
to
be
valued
they
hint
in
a
sort
of
delicately
evasive
way
at
a
rare
temperament
the
temperament
of
a
woman
of
the
east
finding
expression
through
a
western
language
and
under
partly
western
influences
they
do
not
express
the
whole
of
that
temperament
but
they
express
i
think
its
essence
and
there
is
an
eastern
magic
in
them
sarojini
chattopadhyay
was
born
at
hyderabad
on
february
her
father
aghorenath
chattopadhyay
is
descended
from
the
ancient
family
of
chattorajes
of
bhramangram
who
were
noted
throughout
eastern
bengal
as
patrons
of
sanskrit
learning
and
for
their
practice
of
yoga
he
took
his
degree
of
doctor
of
science
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
in
and
afterwards
studied
brilliantly
at
bonn
on
his
return
to
india
he
founded
the
nizam
college
at
hyderabad
and
has
since
laboured
incessantly
and
at
great
personal
sacrifice
in
the
cause
of
education
sarojini
was
the
eldest
of
a
large
family
all
of
whom
were
taught
english
at
an
early
age
i
she
writes
was
stubborn
and
refused
to
speak
it
so
one
day
when
i
was
nine
years
old
my
father
punished
me
the
only
time
i
was
ever
punished
by
shutting
me
in
a
room
alone
for
a
whole
day
i
came
out
of
it
a
linguist
i
have
never
spoken
any
other
language
to
him
or
to
my
mother
who
always
speaks
to
me
in
hindustani
i
do
think
i
had
any
special
hankering
to
write
poetry
as
a
little
child
though
i
was
of
a
very
fanciful
and
dreamy
nature
my
training
under
my
father
eye
was
of
a
sternly
scientific
character
he
was
determined
that
i
should
be
a
great
mathematician
or
a
scientist
but
the
poetic
instinct
which
i
inherited
from
him
and
also
from
my
mother
who
wrote
some
lovely
bengali
lyrics
in
her
youth
proved
stronger
one
day
when
i
was
eleven
i
was
sighing
over
a
sum
in
algebra
it
would
come
right
but
instead
a
whole
poem
came
to
me
suddenly
i
wrote
it
down
from
that
day
my
career
began
at
thirteen
i
wrote
a
long
poem
a
la
of
the
lake
lines
in
six
days
at
thirteen
i
wrote
a
drama
of
lines
a
passionate
thing
that
i
began
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
forethought
just
to
spite
my
doctor
who
said
i
was
very
ill
and
must
not
touch
a
book
my
health
broke
down
permanently
about
this
time
and
my
regular
studies
being
stopped
i
read
voraciously
i
suppose
the
greater
part
of
my
reading
was
done
between
fourteen
and
sixteen
i
wrote
a
novel
i
wrote
fat
volumes
of
journals
i
took
myself
very
seriously
in
those
days
before
she
was
fifteen
the
great
struggle
of
her
life
began
govindurajulu
naidu
now
her
husband
is
though
of
an
old
and
honourable
family
not
a
brahmin
the
difference
of
caste
roused
an
equal
opposition
not
only
on
the
side
of
her
family
but
of
his
and
in
she
was
sent
to
england
against
her
will
with
a
special
scholarship
from
the
nizam
she
remained
in
england
with
an
interval
of
travel
in
italy
till
studying
first
at
king
college
london
then
till
her
health
again
broke
down
at
girton
she
returned
to
hyderabad
in
september
and
in
the
december
of
that
year
to
the
scandal
of
all
india
broke
through
the
bonds
of
caste
and
married
naidu
do
you
know
i
have
some
very
beautiful
poems
floating
in
the
air
she
wrote
to
me
in
and
if
the
gods
are
kind
i
shall
cast
my
soul
like
a
net
and
capture
them
this
year
if
the
gods
are
kind
and
grant
me
a
little
measure
of
health
it
is
all
i
need
to
make
my
life
perfect
for
the
very
of
delight
that
shelley
wrote
of
dwells
in
my
little
home
it
is
full
of
the
music
of
birds
in
the
garden
and
children
in
the
long
arched
verandah
there
are
songs
about
the
children
in
this
book
they
are
called
the
lord
of
battles
the
sun
of
victory
the
and
the
jewel
of
delight
my
ancestors
for
thousands
of
years
i
find
written
in
one
of
her
letters
have
been
lovers
of
the
forest
and
mountain
caves
great
dreamers
great
scholars
great
ascetics
my
father
is
a
dreamer
himself
a
great
dreamer
a
great
man
whose
life
has
been
a
magnificent
failure
i
suppose
in
the
whole
of
india
there
are
few
men
whose
learning
is
greater
than
his
and
i
do
think
there
are
many
men
more
beloved
he
has
a
great
white
beard
and
the
profile
of
homer
and
a
laugh
that
brings
the
roof
down
he
has
wasted
all
his
money
on
two
great
objects
to
help
others
and
on
alchemy
he
holds
huge
courts
every
day
in
his
garden
of
all
the
learned
men
of
all
religions
rajahs
and
beggars
and
saints
and
downright
villains
all
delightfully
mixed
up
and
all
treated
as
one
and
then
his
alchemy
oh
dear
night
and
day
the
experiments
are
going
on
and
every
man
who
brings
a
new
prescription
is
welcome
as
a
brother
but
this
alchemy
is
you
know
only
the
material
counterpart
of
a
poet
craving
for
beauty
the
eternal
beauty
makers
of
gold
and
the
makers
of
verse
they
are
the
twin
creators
that
sway
the
secret
desire
for
mystery
and
what
in
my
father
is
the
genius
of
curiosity
the
very
essence
of
all
scientific
genius
in
me
is
the
desire
for
beauty
do
you
remember
pater
phrase
about
leonardo
da
vinci
and
the
desire
of
beauty
it
was
the
desire
of
beauty
that
made
her
a
poet
her
nerves
of
delight
were
always
quivering
at
the
contact
of
beauty
to
those
who
knew
her
in
england
all
the
life
of
the
tiny
figure
seemed
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
eyes
they
turned
towards
beauty
as
the
sunflower
turns
towards
the
sun
opening
wider
and
wider
until
one
saw
nothing
but
the
eyes
she
was
dressed
always
in
clinging
dresses
of
eastern
silk
and
as
she
was
so
small
and
her
long
black
hair
hung
straight
down
her
back
you
might
have
taken
her
for
a
child
she
spoke
little
and
in
a
low
voice
like
gentle
music
and
she
seemed
wherever
she
was
to
be
alone
through
that
soul
i
seemed
to
touch
and
take
hold
upon
the
east
and
first
there
was
the
wisdom
of
the
east
i
have
never
known
any
one
who
seemed
to
exist
on
such
large
draughts
of
intellectual
day
as
this
child
of
seventeen
to
whom
one
could
tell
all
personal
troubles
and
agitations
as
to
a
wise
old
woman
in
the
east
maturity
comes
early
and
this
child
had
already
lived
through
all
a
woman
life
but
there
was
something
else
something
hardly
personal
something
which
belonged
to
a
consciousness
older
than
the
christian
which
i
realised
wondered
at
and
admired
in
her
passionate
tranquillity
of
mind
before
which
everything
mean
and
trivial
and
temporary
caught
fire
and
burnt
away
in
smoke
her
body
was
never
without
suffering
or
her
heart
without
conflict
but
neither
the
body
weakness
nor
the
heart
violence
could
disturb
that
fixed
contemplation
as
of
buddha
on
his
and
along
with
this
wisdom
as
of
age
or
of
the
age
of
a
race
there
was
what
i
can
hardly
call
less
than
an
agony
of
sensation
pain
or
pleasure
transported
her
and
the
whole
of
pain
or
pleasure
might
be
held
in
a
flower
cup
or
the
imagined
frown
of
a
friend
it
was
never
found
in
those
things
which
to
others
seemed
things
of
importance
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
passed
the
matriculation
of
the
madras
university
and
awoke
to
find
herself
famous
throughout
india
honestly
she
said
to
me
i
was
not
pleased
such
things
did
not
appeal
to
me
but
here
in
a
letter
from
hyderabad
bidding
one
share
a
march
morning
with
her
there
is
at
the
mere
contact
of
the
sun
this
outburst
come
and
share
my
exquisite
march
morning
with
me
this
sumptuous
blaze
of
gold
and
sapphire
sky
these
scarlet
lilies
that
adorn
the
sunshine
the
voluptuous
scents
of
neem
and
champak
and
serisha
that
beat
upon
the
languid
air
with
their
implacable
sweetness
the
thousand
little
gold
and
blue
and
silver
breasted
birds
bursting
with
the
shrill
ecstasy
of
life
in
nesting
time
all
is
hot
and
fierce
and
passionate
ardent
and
unashamed
in
its
exulting
and
importunate
desire
for
life
and
love
and
do
you
know
that
the
scarlet
lilies
are
woven
petal
by
petal
from
my
heart
blood
these
little
quivering
birds
are
my
soul
made
incarnate
music
these
heavy
perfumes
are
my
emotions
dissolved
into
aerial
essence
this
flaming
blue
and
gold
sky
is
the
me
that
part
of
me
that
incessantly
and
insolently
yes
and
a
little
deliberately
triumphs
over
that
other
part
a
thing
of
nerves
and
tissues
that
suffers
and
cries
out
and
that
must
die
perhaps
or
twenty
years
hence
then
there
was
her
humour
which
was
part
of
her
strange
wisdom
and
was
always
awake
and
on
the
watch
in
all
her
letters
written
in
exquisite
english
prose
but
with
an
ardent
imagery
and
a
vehement
sincerity
of
emotion
which
make
them
like
the
poems
indeed
almost
more
directly
oriental
there
was
always
this
intellectual
critical
sense
of
humour
which
could
laugh
at
one
own
enthusiasm
as
frankly
as
that
enthusiasm
had
been
set
down
and
partly
the
humour
like
the
delicate
reserve
of
her
manner
was
a
mask
or
a
shelter
i
have
taught
myself
she
writes
to
me
from
india
to
be
commonplace
and
like
everybody
else
superficially
every
one
thinks
i
am
so
nice
and
cheerful
so
all
the
banal
things
that
are
so
comfortable
to
be
my
mother
knows
me
only
as
a
tranquil
child
but
so
a
tranquil
child
and
she
writes
again
with
deeper
significance
i
too
have
learnt
the
subtle
philosophy
of
living
from
moment
to
moment
yes
it
is
a
subtle
philosophy
though
it
appears
merely
an
epicurean
doctrine
drink
and
be
merry
for
we
die
i
have
gone
through
so
many
yesterdays
when
i
strove
with
death
that
i
have
realised
to
its
full
the
wisdom
of
that
sentence
and
it
is
to
me
not
merely
a
figure
of
speech
but
a
literal
fact
any
i
might
die
it
is
scarcely
two
months
since
i
came
back
from
the
grave
is
it
worth
while
to
be
anything
but
radiantly
glad
of
all
things
that
life
or
perhaps
my
temperament
has
given
me
i
prize
the
gift
of
laughter
as
beyond
price
her
desire
always
was
to
be
a
wild
free
thing
of
the
air
like
the
birds
with
a
song
in
my
heart
a
spirit
of
too
much
fire
in
too
frail
a
body
it
was
rarely
that
her
desire
was
fully
granted
but
in
italy
she
found
what
she
could
not
find
in
england
and
from
italy
her
letters
are
radiant
this
italy
is
made
of
gold
she
writes
from
florence
the
gold
of
dawn
and
daylight
the
gold
of
the
stars
and
now
dancing
in
weird
enchanting
rhythms
through
this
magic
month
of
may
the
gold
of
fireflies
in
the
perfumed
darkness
gold
i
long
to
catch
the
subtle
music
of
their
fairy
dances
and
make
a
poem
with
a
rhythm
like
the
quick
irregular
wild
flash
of
their
sudden
movements
would
it
not
be
wonderful
one
black
night
i
stood
in
a
garden
with
fireflies
in
my
hair
like
darting
restless
stars
caught
in
a
mesh
of
darkness
it
gave
me
a
strange
sensation
as
if
i
were
not
human
at
all
but
an
elfin
spirit
i
wonder
why
these
little
things
move
me
so
deeply
it
is
because
i
have
a
most
intellect
i
suppose
then
looking
out
on
florence
she
cries
god
how
beautiful
it
is
and
how
glad
i
am
that
i
am
alive
and
she
tells
me
that
she
is
drinking
in
the
beauty
like
wine
wine
golden
and
scented
and
shining
fit
for
the
gods
and
the
gods
have
drunk
it
the
dead
gods
of
etruria
two
thousand
years
ago
did
i
say
dead
no
for
the
gods
are
immortal
and
one
might
still
find
them
loitering
in
some
solitary
dell
on
the
grey
hillsides
of
fiesole
have
i
seen
them
yes
looking
with
dreaming
eyes
i
have
found
them
sitting
under
the
olives
in
their
grave
strong
antique
beauty
etruscan
gods
in
italy
she
watches
the
faces
of
the
monks
and
at
one
moment
longs
to
attain
to
their
peace
by
renunciation
longs
for
nirvana
then
when
one
comes
out
again
into
the
hot
sunshine
that
warms
one
blood
and
sees
the
eager
hurrying
faces
of
men
and
women
in
the
street
dramatic
faces
over
which
the
disturbing
experiences
of
life
have
passed
and
left
their
symbols
one
heart
thrills
up
into
one
throat
no
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
how
can
one
deliberately
renounce
this
coloured
unquiet
fiery
human
life
of
the
earth
and
all
the
time
her
subtle
criticism
is
alert
and
this
woman
of
the
east
marvels
at
the
women
of
the
west
the
beautiful
worldly
women
of
the
west
whom
she
sees
walking
in
the
cascine
taking
the
air
so
consciously
attractive
in
their
brilliant
toilettes
in
the
brilliant
coquetry
of
their
manner
she
finds
them
a
little
incomprehensible
profound
artists
in
all
the
subtle
intricacies
of
fascination
and
asks
if
these
incalculable
frivolities
and
vanities
and
coquetries
and
caprices
are
to
us
an
essential
part
of
their
charm
and
she
watches
them
with
amusement
as
they
flutter
about
her
petting
her
as
if
she
were
a
nice
child
a
child
or
a
toy
not
dreaming
that
she
is
saying
to
herself
sorrowfully
how
utterly
empty
their
lives
must
be
of
all
spiritual
beauty
if
they
are
nothing
more
than
they
appear
to
be
she
sat
in
our
midst
and

round

conquer
the
sorrow
of
life
with
the
sorrow
of
song
past

future
the
new
hath
come
and
now
the
old
retires
and
so
the
past
becomes
a
where
lone
apart
old
dwell
in
consecrated
calm
forgotten
yet
of
the
keen
heart
that
hastens
to
forget
old
longings

desires

now
the
soul
stands
in
a
vague
intense
expectancy
and
anguish
of
suspense
on
the
dim
lo
he
sees
like
a
strange
fated
bride
as
yet
unknown
his
timid
future
shrinking
there
alone
beneath
her
of

ye
have
not

to
you
it

a

joys
that
leap
about
your

like
billows
on
the

in

amber

keep
silence
in
thy
soul
beyond
the

but
in
the
desolate
hour
of
midnight
when
an
ecstasy
of
starry
silence
sleeps
on
the
still
mountains
and
the
soundless
deeps
and
my
soul
hungers
for
thy
voice
o
then
love
like
the
magic
of
wild
melodies
let
thy
soul
answer
mine
across
the
seas
to
the
god
of

unwilling
priestess
in
thy
cruel
fane
long
hast
thou
held
me
pitiless
god
of

bound
to
thy
worship
by
reluctant
vows
my
tired
breast
girt
with
suffering
and
my
brows
anointed
with
perpetual
weariness
long
have
i
borne
thy
service
through
the
stress
of
rigorous
years
sad
days
and
slumberless
nights
performing
thine
inexorable
rites
for
thy
dark
altars
balm
nor
milk
nor
rice
but
mine
own
soul
for
sacrifice
all
the
rich
honey
of
my
youth
desire
and
all
the
sweet
oils
from
my
crushed
life
drawn
and
all
my
dreams
and
fire
of
hopes
like
the
light
of
dawn
i
have
no
more
to
give
all
that
was
mine
is
laid
a
wrested
tribute
at
thy
shrine
let
me
depart
for
my
whole
soul
is
wrung
and
all
my
cheerless
orisons
are
sung
let
me
depart
with
faint
limbs
let
me
creep
to
some
dim
shade
and
sink
me
down
to
sleep
the
song
of
princess
in
praise
of
her
own
beauty
from
the
persian
when
from
my
cheek
i
lift
my
veil
the
roses
turn
with
envy
pale
and
from
their
pierced
hearts
rich
with
pain
send
forth
their
fragrance
like
a
wail
or
if
perchance
one
perfumed
tress
be
lowered
to
the
wind
caress
the
honeyed
hyacinths
complain
and
languish
in
a
sweet
distress
and
when
i
pause
still
groves
among
such
loveliness
is
mine
a
throng
of
nightingales
awake
and
strain
their
souls
into
a
quivering
song
indian
dancers
eyes
ravished
with
rapture
celestially
panting
what
passionate
bosoms
aflaming
with
fire
drink
deep
of
the
hush
of
the
hyacinth
heavens
that
glimmer
around
them
in
fountains
of
light
o
wild
and
entrancing
the
strain
of
keen
music
that
cleaveth
the
stars
like
a
wail
of
desire
and
beautiful
dancers
with
faces
bewitch
the
voluptuous
watches
of
night
the
scents
of
red
roses
and
sandalwood
flutter
and
die
in
the
maze
of
their
hair
and
smiles
are
entwining
like
magical
serpents
the
poppies
of
lips
that
are
their
glittering
garments
of
purple
are
burning
like
tremulous
dawns
in
the
quivering
air
and
exquisite
subtle
and
slow
are
the
tinkle
and
tread
of
their
rhythmical
feet
now
silent
now
singing
and
swaying
and
swinging
like
blossoms
that
bend
to
the
breezes
or
showers
now
wantonly
winding
they
flash
now
they
falter
and
lingering
languish
in
radiant
choir
their
arms
and
warm
wavering
fingers
enchant
through
melodious
hours
eyes
ravished
with
rapture
celestially
panting
what
passionate
bosoms
aflaming
with

my

you

you
awake

me
beyond
the
cerulean
foam
of
the
deep

you
tear
from
my
lintels
these
sacred
green
garlands
of
leaves
would
you
scare
the
white
nested
wild
pigeons
of
joy
from
my
eaves
would
you
touch
and
defile
with
dead
fingers
the
robes
of
my
priest
would
you
weave
your
dim
moan
with
the
chantings
of
love
at
my
feast
go
back
to
your
grave
o
my
dream
